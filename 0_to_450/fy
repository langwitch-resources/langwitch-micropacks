You never knew whether you would see them again.	Jo wisten noait oft jo se wer sjen soene.
Not more than he did.	Net mear as hy die.
No chance of that here.	Gjin kâns op dat hjir.
The work went on hard.	It wurk gie hurd troch.
Well, not exactly that.	No, net krekt dat.
You just do not want to say that you can not do something.	Jo wolle gewoan net sizze dat jo net wat kinne dwaan.
I have nothing to do with it now.	Ik ha der no neat oan.
I'm trying to be your friend.	Ik besykje dyn freon te wêzen.
He just waited for her to make up her mind.	Hy wachte gewoan op har om har gedachten te meitsjen.
No idea if that's true.	Gjin idee oft dat wier is.
I could not let him become my mother.	Ik koe him net litte as myn mem wurde.
Do not talk about me against her.	Praat net oer my tsjin har.
For me, that does not work.	Foar my wurket dat net.
She has him now, she knows it.	Se hat him no, se wit it.
Stick to it.	Hâlde der oan.
I thought only of myself.	Ik tocht allinnich oan my.
It can be quite.	It kin hielendal.
Make it so.	Meitsje it sa.
Back to that letter.	Werom nei dy brief.
I did not even want to be here.	Ik woe hjir sels net wêze.
As if they do not know you.	As ken se dy net.
She would make this work.	Se soe meitsje dit wurk.
Of course they are.	Fansels binne se.
He had just found the place.	Hy hie krekt it plak fûn.
She can just eat.	Se kin gewoan ite.
I'm not the man you think.	Ik bin net de man dy't jo tinke.
Well, they can have it.	No, se kinne it hawwe.
Do not talk about it again.	Praat der net wer oer.
If you have not done so, you should.	As jo ​​​​it net dien hawwe, dan moatte jo.
Comes when it comes.	Komt as it komt.
What you do not do.	Wat jo net dogge.
It's pretty clear.	It is moai dúdlik.
It would be good to see the truth.	It soe goed wêze om de wierheid te sjen.
I feel pretty sick.	Ik fiel my aardich siik.
That is, everything just gets in the way.	Dat is, alles komt gewoan yn 'e wei.
Together we decided.	Tegearre hawwe wy besletten.
Would work.	Soe wurkje.
You think about why that happens.	Jo tinke oan wêrom't dat bart.
I'm going out.	Ik gean út.
This time it will be something different.	Dizze kear wurdt it wat oars.
You have to win.	Jo moatte winne.
Well, there you go.	No, dêr geane jo.
We want to too.	Wy wolle ek.
But you're a man.	Mar do bist in man.
The plan is in place.	It plan is yn plak.
He knew as well as she had told him.	Hy wist like goed as hie se it him ferteld.
The reason is that is exactly how we think it.	De reden is dat krekt hoe't wy it tinke.
Talk a lot.	Praat in protte.
I would tell her about the door.	Ik soe har fertelle oer de doar.
He set up another one.	Hy sette noch ien op.
I ask people why they believe.	Ik freegje minsken wêrom se leauwe.
I would not like to see what is there now.	Ik soe net graach sjen wat der no is.
I had never done this before.	Ik hie dit noch noait earder dien.
She had no idea where.	Se hie gjin idee wêr.
He thought only of himself.	Hy tocht allinnich oan himsels.
I just get so tired of doing that.	Ik wurd gewoan sa wurch om dat te dwaan.
That's what we want.	Dat wolle wy.
He's one of my best friends.	Hy fan myn bêste freonen.
She wondered if he would ever come to her again.	Se frege har ôf oft er oait wer by har komme soe.
One month and no more.	Ien moanne en net mear.
She had come to him.	Se hie by him kommen.
Are you from here?	Binne jo fan hjir hinne?
I'm your friend.	Ik bin dyn freon.
And then she goes on, as if nothing had happened.	En dan giet se troch, as is der neat bard.
It's your money.	It is dyn jild.
Or, let me make that clear.	Of, lit my dat dúdlik meitsje.
I do not think it is.	Ik tink net dat it is.
Even he looked out of place.	Sels seach er der út.
I will find work.	Ik sil wurk fine.
That way, you can do whatever you want.	Op dy manier kinne jo dwaan wat jo wolle.
A few months ago he asked for her hand.	In pear moanne lyn frege er om har hân.
But it was getting late.	Mar it waard let.
But nothing came of it.	Mar der kaam neat by him.
You never know how a book might do it.	Jo witte noait hoe't in boek it docht.
Someone ran in front of him.	Immen rûn him foar.
It did not look like there was one.	It like der net op dat der ien wie.
I was told not to talk.	Ik waard ferteld net te praten.
So we both tried.	Sa hawwe wy beide besocht.
It seems to have worked so far.	It liket oant no ta wurke te hawwen.
They said they do it three times a week.	Se seine dat se it trije kear yn 'e wike dogge.
No one had money.	Gjinien hie jild.
They do things quite differently.	Se dogge dingen aardich oars.
I could hardly get to his bed.	Ik koe min wei nei syn bêd komme.
I would like to work with you on this.	Ik wol hjir graach mei jo oan wurkje.
And there is much more.	En der is folle mear.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Mar dat liket net sa te wêzen.
It was a morning like this.	It wie in moarn as dizze.
He will not be away long.	Hy sil net lang fuort.
That I would have done.	Dat soe ik dien hawwe.
Probably a day or two.	Wierskynlik in dei as twa.
She did something for me that she will never know.	Se die wat foar my dat se noait sil witte.
Well, it was so.	No, it wie sa.
I love it too.	Ik hâld der ek fan.
I can not believe she's mine.	Ik kin net leauwe dat se fan my is.
Neither did his mother.	Syn mem ek net.
There is no other reason.	Der is gjin oare reden.
I want to be with him more.	Ik wol mear by him wêze.
The latter made ready to leave.	De lêste makke ree om fuort te gean.
He will hurt you.	Hy sil dy sear dwaan.
I can do that.	Dat kin ik wol.
He liked to do things.	Hy mocht graach dingen dwaan.
And be nice to mom.	En wês aardich tsjin mem.
I have a plan.	Ik haw in plan.
She would never want to let him.	Se soe har nea wolle litte him.
Even now he can do that.	Ek no kin er dat dwaan.
His wife did not.	Syn frou net.
I hope he has.	Ik hoopje dat hy hat.
Then talk to you.	Praat dan mei dy.
But do not go.	Mar gean net.
I'm just real.	Ik bin gewoan echt.
I've told you before.	Ik haw dy earder sein.
The children go back to school.	De bern geane werom nei skoalle.
Friend for his question.	Freon foar syn fraach.
Syn.	Syn.
So we all agree.	Sa binne wy ​​it dan allegear iens.
You're a young man.	Do bist in jonge man.
I'm here to stay.	Ik bin hjir om te bliuwen.
Of course, there is much more.	Fansels is der noch folle mear.
Otherwise, but not better.	Oars, mar net better.
This or nothing.	Dit of neat.
It should be, but it is not.	It soe wêze moatte, mar it is it net.
She worked hard.	Se wurke hurd.
It's very beautiful.	It is hiel moai.
I should have.	Ik moast hawwe.
It was more of an idea.	It wie mear in idee.
He should have returned for her.	Hy hie foar har werom moatten.
He said he was in all the way.	Hy sei dat er de hiele wei yn wie.
She's not here for me.	Se is hjir net foar my.
So were the children.	Sa wiene de bern.
But now it may be too late.	Mar no kin it te let wêze.
Other than that, it should work.	Oars as dat moat it wurkje.
Not three, not more, but two.	Net trije, net mear, mar twa.
But so far nothing has happened.	Mar oant no ta is der neat bard.
Now here's the problem.	No hjir is it probleem.
The problem is, it was us.	It probleem is, it wiene wy.
For good reason though.	Om goede reden wol.
Neither did his wife, nor his father.	Syn frou ek net, noch syn heit.
He was the only one who did not.	Hy wie de ienige dy't net hie.
They look fun.	Se lykje leuk.
I just could not eat it.	Ik koe it gewoan net ite.
Go on, show me.	Gean troch, lit my sjen.
Only gets better.	Giet allinnich mar better.
It's so good and so easy.	Dit is sa sa goed en sa maklik.
And the same thing happens to me.	En itselde ding bart mei my.
My wife went there to help these people.	Myn frou gie dêr om dizze minsken te helpen.
We can not let this happen.	Wy kinne dit net barre litte.
It was not from him.	It wie net fan him.
It's just too hard.	It is gewoan te dreech.
But not too long.	Mar net te lang.
We would love to work with you.	Wy soene graach mei jo wurkje.
She could still do that.	Dat koe se noch.
She goes home to the children.	Se giet nei de bern nei hûs.
I did a lot of reading at school today.	Ik haw hjoed in protte lêzen dien op skoalle.
This is not mine!	Dit is net fan my!
Nothing was good.	Neat wie goed.
It just wasn't true.	It wie gewoan net wier.
But that is not true.	Mar dat is net wier.
I know my father.	Ik ken myn heit.
I went into them.	Ik gie yn har.
I do not know if that will work, but it can.	Ik wit net oft dat it wurk sil dwaan, mar it kin wol.
I see something in you.	Ik sjoch wat yn dy.
That was the dog.	Dat wie de hûn.
I would hold your hand.	Ik soe jo hân hâlde.
There seemed to be nothing else to do.	Der like neat oars te dwaan.
But do not think about it.	Mar tink der net om.
I hold out the letter to her without reading it.	Ik hâld it brief nei har út sûnder it te lêzen.
I knew right away that she had nothing.	Ik wist fuort dat se neat hie.
I wish they knew.	Ik woe dat se it wisten.
She asked him.	Se frege him.
She does not even know what she will do when she gets there.	Se wit net iens wat se dwaan sil as se der komt.
Children should not work like that.	Bern moatte net sa wurkje.
He did not look so well.	Hy seach net sa goed.
It's he who will dog me.	It is hy dy't my hûn sil.
This is it !.	Dit is it!.
People talk and do not do so.	Minsken prate en dogge net sa.
And let me tell you one more thing.	En lit my jo noch ien ding fertelle.
I'm too old and there is nothing left for me.	Ik bin te âld en der is neat mear foar my oer.
It's not a bad city.	It is gjin minne stêd.
Hours and hours of time.	Oeren en oeren tiid.
Over there! 	Dêr!
that's enough for her.	dat is har genôch.
Not really an easy thing.	Net echt in maklik ding.
And she did that very much.	En dat hat se tige dien.
Not so now.	No net sa.
She was actually gone.	Se wie eins fuort.
He saw her often.	Hy seach har faak.
I will try to make that clear.	Ik sil besykje dat dúdlik te meitsjen.
Be carefull.	Wês foarsichtich.
Just not with me.	Krekt net mei my.
They always get the job done.	Se krije altyd it wurk dien.
And that was them, really.	En dat wiene se, echt.
They are always busy with food.	Se binne altyd drok mei iten.
I know this though.	Ik wit dit wol.
Maybe he had something else in mind.	Miskien hie er wat oars yn gedachten.
Never before or since seen such a thing.	Noch noait earder of sûnt sa'n ding sjoen.
But there was much more.	Mar der wie folle mear.
I asked him.	Ik frege him.
That's the way.	Dat is de wei.
I saw that she was not.	Ik seach dat se net wie.
But why would she not, she thought angrily.	Mar wêrom soe se net, tocht se lilk.
He says, these are too beautiful.	Hy seit, dizze binne te moai.
They just know what they want and how to get it.	Se witte gewoan wat se wolle en hoe't se it krije.
Until the next time it happened.	Oant de oare kear dat it barde.
He really is.	Hy is echt.
He died on me.	Hy stoar op my.
That was our home.	Dat wie ús thús.
I had never seen such a thing.	Ik hie noch noait sa'n ding sjoen.
I do not think so.	Ik tink net.
You will go to school.	Jo sille nei skoalle gean.
This book is my favorite so far.	Dit boek is myn favorite oant no ta.
I let you go.	Ik lit dy gean.
Just give it time.	Jou it mar tiid.
They are no different.	Se binne net oars.
I love this time of year.	Ik hâld fan dizze tiid fan it jier.
If he were to come upon her.	As er op har komme soe.
So be it then.	Sa wêze it dan.
Whatever she said, it would be wrong.	Wat se ek sei, it soe ferkeard wêze.
I'm glad to see you too.	Ik bin bliid dy ek te sjen.
I kind of like the guy.	Ik aardich graach de keardel.
Just help me.	Help my gewoan.
She had no idea how late it was.	Se hie gjin idee hoe let it wie.
They do not want to.	Se wolle net.
Just show that you are interested when you are.	Lit gewoan sjen dat jo ynteressearre binne as jo binne.
So far it has not.	Oant no ta is it noch net.
Please see it.	Sjoch it asjebleaft.
We have an office.	Wy hawwe in kantoar.
Let us know which one is the.	Lit ús witte hokker ien is de.
You can get everything.	Jo kinne alles krije.
And clearly she is so interested.	En dúdlik is se sa ynteressearre.
I hope it is not.	Ik hoopje dat it net is.
And he looked so scared.	En hy seach sa bang.
I wish that would happen soon.	Ik winskje dat dat gau barre soe.
We had food, water.	Wy hiene iten, wetter.
Or we will leave too.	Of wy sille ek fuort.
We take and take until you have no more to give.	Wy nimme en nimme oant jo net mear te jaan hawwe.
But what they really want is that everything is different.	Mar wat se echt wolle is dat alles oars is.
I wish that was true.	Ik winskje dat dat wier wie.
This is the first time it has ever happened.	Dit is de earste kear dat it ea bard is.
Were not what they had asked.	Wiene net wat se hiene frege.
Without me, nothing happens here.	Sûnder my bart hjir neat.
They are not who and what you are.	Se binne net wa en wat jo binne.
It does not stop there.	Dêr hâldt it net op.
Just think of today.	Tink mar oan hjoed.
Of course he did not.	Fansels hat er dat net dien.
People are still talking about it.	Minsken prate der noch oer.
That's fine with me.	Dat is goed by my.
What a question.	Wat in fraach.
He came home.	Hy kaam thús.
I almost gave it up.	Ik joech it hast op.
I wore it.	Ik hie it oan.
I have good days and bad days.	Ik haw goede dagen en minne dagen.
I've gone three times now.	Ik bin no trije kear gien.
But nothing was done.	Mar der waard neat dien.
I'll put something about you.	Ik sil wat oer dy sette.
He asked me.	Hy frege my om.
I came here.	Ik kaam hjir.
The food was very good.	It iten wie hiel goed.
It was nice to have them all here.	It wie leuk om se allegear hjir te hawwen.
Same thing as having young children.	Itselde ding as jo jonge bern hawwe.
But that's not easy to do.	Mar dat is net maklik om te dwaan.
But there is reason for hope.	Mar d'r is reden foar hope.
A few people enter this room.	In pear minsken komme dizze keamer yn.
And they both know they can not stay here.	En beide witte se dat se hjir net bliuwe kinne.
I now know what it is.	Ik wit no wat it is.
Twice a week.	Twa kear yn de wike.
I had nothing against the girl.	Ik hie neat tsjin it famke.
What should this do to him.	Wat moat dit him dwaan.
Why do you want to do this?	Wêrom wolle jo dit dwaan?
I want to live here forever.	Ik wol hjir foar altyd wenje.
That's just out of the question.	Dat is gewoan út 'e fraach.
There had been no reason for that.	Dêr hie gjin reden ta west.
They take good care of you.	Se soargje goed foar dy.
Whatever you think of it.	Wat jo dêr ek oan tinke.
A real thing.	In echt ding.
They will tell you what can not be done, and why.	Se sille jo fertelle wat net kin wurde dien, en wêrom.
We still love each other.	Wy hâlde noch fan elkoar.
It somehow did what he wanted.	It die op ien of oare manier wat er woe.
He's on you.	Hy is op dy.
Neither do you.	Jo ek net.
He is not one of us.	Hy is net ien fan ús.
That does worry me.	Dat makket my wol soargen.
That's what my friend told me.	Dat hat myn freon my ferteld.
She thought long and hard about the question.	Se tocht lang oer de fraach.
The time is coming for all of us.	De tiid komt foar ús allegear.
There is not much more left, but it is clear.	Der is net folle mear oer, mar it is dúdlik.
He worked, worked and worked some more.	Hy wurke, wurke en wurke noch wat.
She just could not.	Se koe it gewoan net.
I wanted to go to the office.	Ik woe nei it kantoar.
Just give me up.	Jou my net op.
They think through us.	Se tinke troch ús hinne.
She could not worry now.	Se koe har no gjin soargen meitsje.
I could not give up.	Ik koe my net jaan.
Do not do that.	Doch dat net.
I know it in a day or so.	Ik wit it oer in dei as wat.
And I have a job.	En ik haw in baan.
She tried not to do it, but could not help it.	Se besocht it net te dwaan, mar koe it net helpe.
I sat and said it.	Ik siet en sei it.
I want to tell you this.	Ik wol dy dit fertelle.
To the door.	Nei de doar.
I'm scared of next year.	Ik bin bang foar takom jier.
Of course, it had not worked.	Fansels hie it net wurke.
You knew that.	Dat wisten jo.
Got it out.	Hat it út.
He opened the whole house.	Hy die it hiele hûs iepen.
We need to get away from this idea.	Wy moatte fuort fan dit idee.
She can not help it.	Se kin it net helpe.
It's so easy.	It is sa maklik.
Talk about what you want to do.	Praat oer wat jo wolle dwaan.
He was afraid to talk.	Hy wie bang om te praten.
The house felt lived in.	It hûs fielde wenne yn.
I had a really good time.	Ik hie echt goede tiid.
Do not wait to be asked.	Wachtsje net om frege te wurden.
There is enough water and things to eat.	D'r is genôch wetter, en dingen te iten.
They were not in it.	Se wiene der net yn.
He has no reason.	Hy hat gjin reden.
Well, it can be.	No, it kin wêze.
He may have just gone home.	Hy kin gewoan nei hûs gien wêze.
Did you say anything else?	Hawwe jo noch wat sein?
Two more months left.	Noch twa moanne oer.
You have to pay for that.	Dêr moatte jo foar betelje.
It will be me and my girl.	It sil my en myn famke wêze.
I really want him here.	Ik wol echt dat er hjir is.
But here seems to be more than that.	Mar hjir liket mear te wêzen as dat.
I do not want to return to my place.	Ik wol net werom nei myn plak.
To make something.	Om wat te meitsjen.
I expected more.	Ik ferwachte mear.
I'm visiting my wife.	Ik besykje myn frou.
I feel really bad.	Ik fiel my echt min.
There will be more.	Der komt mear.
Now everyone is in town.	No binne allegear yn 'e stêd.
You have to go now.	Jo moatte no fuort gean.
Always keep clear of this man.	Hâld altyd dúdlik fan dizze man.
And she would not even talk to me first.	En se soe net iens earst mei my prate.
I have a good job.	Ik haw in goede baan.
Getting in and out is not difficult.	Yn en út komme is net dreech.
I can not get there until tonight.	Ik kin der net oant fannacht komme.
I was out there when everything went through.	Ik wie der út doe't alles gie troch.
That will show her.	Dat sil har sjen litte.
Said he was a father himself.	Sei hy wie in heit sels.
It still did.	It die noch.
But it may be that they are out of time.	Mar it kin wêze dat se út de tiid.
No one went in or out.	Nimmen gie yn of út.
There was plenty to do.	Der wie genôch te dwaan.
I really just can not get enough.	Ik kin echt gewoan net genôch krije.
So she was here.	Sa wie se hjir.
Then there's one more thing with the name.	Dan is d'r noch ien ding mei de namme.
Whatever it is that will happen.	Wat it ek is dat sil barre.
Be very careful my friend.	Wês heul foarsichtich myn freon.
He thought he knew that now.	Hy tocht dat er dat no wist.
He looked at her and seemed to say something.	Hy seach har oan en like wat te sizzen.
Still they waited.	Noch altyd wachte se.
You're not a woman.	Do bist gjin frou.
That life was no longer mine.	Dat libben wie net mear fan my.
Well, that's all true.	No, dat is allegear wier.
Tomorrow will be better than today, that's for sure.	Moarn sil it better wêze as hjoed, dat is wis.
And then there would be nothing.	En dan soe der neat wêze.
I have no money now.	Ik haw no gjin jild.
My mother told me about it.	Myn mem fertelde my der oer.
But we do have someone who disagrees.	Mar wy hawwe wol ien dy't it net iens is.
I have been to his house a lot this year.	Ik ha dit jier in protte by syn hûs west.
Only nothing is ever the same.	Allinnich neat is ea itselde.
More time with her.	Mear tiid mei har.
They have something we do not have.	Se hawwe wat dat wy net hawwe.
He said he wanted to show me something.	Hy sei dat er my wat sjen litte woe.
Do not worry about Me.	Meitsje dy net drok om My.
I now want to try to say something.	Ik wol no besykje wat te sizzen.
Someone looking at me.	Ien dy't nei my sjocht.
If the thing works long enough.	As it ding lang genôch wurket.
But come in, come in.	Mar kom yn, kom yn.
It is clear that this could not be so.	It is dúdlik dat dit net sa koe.
But those things were not the problems.	Mar dy dingen wiene net de problemen.
This is the room where you make food.	Dit is de keamer wêr't jo iten meitsje.
But, today was fun.	Mar, hjoed wie leuk.
And it was the right thing to do.	En it wie it goede ding om te dwaan.
Everyone liked them.	Elkenien mocht se graach.
You're here now.	Do bist hjir no.
But that did not happen.	Mar dat barde net.
Not pretty at all.	Hielendal net moai.
He needs to do things.	Hy moat dingen dwaan.
Believe me, it is.	Leau my, it is.
At first she was afraid to go out alone.	Earst wie se bang om allinnich út te gean.
Keep our hair long.	Hâld ús hier lang.
They do not speak.	Se prate net.
We will never know the truth of what has happened now.	Wy sille noait de wierheid witte fan wat der no bard is.
And that can not.	En dat kin net.
For the office.	Foar it kantoar.
I hope it is.	Ik hoopje dat it is.
Long on demand.	Lang op fraach.
I did not even know that thoughts were not real.	Ik wist net iens dat gedachten net echt wiene.
He must be against the boy.	Hy moat miskien tsjin de jonge.
But here's something he can not yet leave.	Mar hjir is wat dat er noch net litte kin.
Keep it there.	Hâld it dêr.
You had to go.	Do moast gean.
He knew it all.	Hy koe it allegear.
She did almost enough.	Se hast genôch die.
She was under water.	Se wie ûnder wetter.
It was beautiful there again.	It wie dêr wer moai.
You are in them, they take time.	Jo binne yn har, se nimme tiid.
I should have given you everything.	Ik hie dy alles jaan moatten.
And worries.	En soargen.
We are happy.	Wy binne bliid.
I walked back.	Ik rûn werom.
I have to go there, he said to himself.	Ik moat der hinne, sei er tsjin himsels.
Let me have what you have in mind.	Lit my hawwe wat jo yn gedachten hawwe.
He had never met a girl like her.	Hy hie noch noait in famke as har moete.
Then it's good.	Dan is it goed.
I told mom what he said.	Ik fertelde mem wat er sei.
I do not believe that.	Dat leau ik net.
When it did, he did not show it.	As it die, liet er it net sjen.
But no one was ready to talk about it.	Mar gjinien wie ree om der oer te praten.
He should be much better this year.	Hy moat dit jier folle better wêze.
If it were not, more people would do it.	As it net wie, soene mear minsken it dwaan.
I so agree.	Ik bin it sa mei iens.
Well, those were my words actually.	No, it wiene myn wurden eins.
The only thing is.	It ienige ding is.
It was not long ago that he was the same.	It wie net lang lyn dat er itselde wie.
It would be wrong to do so.	It soe ferkeard wêze om te dwaan.
It makes me really happy.	It makket my echt bliid.
Things are clear.	Dingen binne dúdlik.
It must have hurt him.	It moat him sear dien hawwe.
I have to tell her.	Ik moat it har fertelle.
Everything works fine.	Alles wurket goed.
There was no way out.	Der wie gjin wei út.
That's exactly what he wanted.	Dat is krekt wat er woe.
No one will talk.	Nimmen sil prate.
Here is a picture of one.	Hjir is in foto fan ien.
They are the same.	Se binne itselde.
They know where we are.	Se witte wêr't wy binne.
We want to get people to do what we want.	Wy wolle minsken krije om te dwaan wat wy wolle.
He had thought it would be so.	Hy hie tocht dat it sa wêze soe.
But for now, she felt free.	Mar foar no fielde se har frij.
They just love going to work.	Se geane gewoan graach oan it wurk.
Or something from earlier.	Of wat fan earder.
Today, everyone does everything.	Hjoed docht elkenien alles.
But this does not have to be the case.	Mar dit hoecht net sa te wêzen.
Would not be the same anymore.	Soe no net mear itselde wêze.
I know it's very good.	Ik wit wol dat it hiel goed is.
Not around me.	Net om my hinne.
The young man was busy reading.	De jonge man wie drok yn it lêzen.
You are ready.	Jo binne klear.
Let them do it on another day.	Lit se it op in oare dei dwaan.
She had never been here before.	Se wie hjir noch noait earder west.
Well, you can not have them or him.	No, jo kinne se of him net hawwe.
It's not a bit like that.	It is net in bytsje sa.
There has never been one.	Der hat noait ien west.
But now we are.	Mar no binne wy.
This is how life becomes our teacher.	Sa wurdt it libben ús learaar.
They would never take them in there.	Se soene har der noait yn nimme.
We all ask ourselves.	Wy freegje ús allegear ôf.
That's what you need.	Dat is wat jo nedich hawwe.
In a way, that was good.	Op in manier wie dat goed.
I'm just home.	Ik bin krekt thús.
Had to know.	Moast witte.
But he's scared.	Mar hy is bang.
Must leave.	Moatte fuort.
She made her with him.	Se makke har mei him.
He had done it.	Hy hie it dien.
Water was always enough.	Wetter wie altyd genôch.
I do not like to be surprised.	Ik hâld der net fan om ferrast te wurden.
No matter where.	Makket net út wêr.
He was where he needed to be.	Hy wie wêr't er wêze moast.
It did really well.	It die echt goed.
Both of us would.	Beide fan ús soe.
I can not speak now.	Ik kin no net prate.
Not one of you.	Net iens fan dy.
He did not even try to go to bed.	Hy besocht net iens op bêd te gean.
Really nicely done.	Echt moai dien.
He really did.	Hy die echt.
He put it away.	Hy sette it fuort.
Remember that.	Tink der oan.
It may be that she never will be.	It kin wêze dat se noait sil wêze.
We could not do it forever.	Wy koene it net foar altyd dwaan.
I was late that day.	Ik wie te let dy dei.
This clearly does not happen.	Dit bart dúdlik net.
There was really nothing to do at home.	Der wie eins neat te dwaan thús.
But before we do anything else, we need to have something to eat.	Mar foardat wy wat oars dogge, moatte wy wat te iten hawwe.
In fact, that was not difficult.	Eins wie dat net dreech.
There is not much you can do.	Der is net folle kinne jo dwaan.
But wait for it.	Mar wachtsje op it.
I have never looked back.	Ik haw noait werom sjoen.
She knew of him.	Se wist fan him.
He is so.	Hy is sa.
This is the last thing you want.	Dit is it lêste wat jo wolle.
There was nothing left.	Dêr bleau neat oer.
I had nothing to do with it.	Ik hie der neat om.
We love her.	Wy hâlde fan har.
And that should be enough.	En dat sil wol genôch wêze moatte.
Nobody talks to me in the office.	Nimmen praat mei my op it kantoar.
And there was only one way.	En der wie mar ien manier.
They did their job and are doing well.	Se diene har wurk en dogge it goed.
See what new things there are.	Sjoch hokker nije dingen der binne.
Maybe this is just not for me.	Miskien is dizze gewoan net foar my.
Like it or not.	Graach of net.
That could not be a bad thing.	Dat koe gjin min ding wêze.
We would not have to worry about that place.	Wy soene gjin soargen hawwe oer dat plak.
This is where the money comes from.	Hjir komt it jild wei.
The truth is told.	De wierheid wurdt sein.
And it's just that.	En it is krekt dat.
My car was gone.	Myn auto wie fuort.
Yours looks even better.	Dyn sjocht der noch better út.
He saw them.	Hy seach se.
But she could not.	Mar se koe it net.
What is your name?	Wat is jo namme?
I have to keep this in mind.	Ik moat dit yn gedachten hâlde.
I do that for a lifetime.	Ik doch dat foar in libben.
Do not go where they tell you to.	Gean net wêr't se jo sizze.
His family was with him.	Syn famylje wie by him.
They are late.	Se binne let.
The children will be surprised.	De bern sille ferrast wurde.
So much to do in one day.	Safolle te dwaan yn in dei.
But we already know these things.	Mar wy witte dizze dingen al.
He ate alone.	Hy iet allinnich.
But he knows he can not.	Mar hy wit dat er net kin.
I need to be ready.	Ik moat klear wêze.
I felt so bad for the family.	Ik fielde my sa min foar de famylje.
I knew my wife.	Ik koe myn frou.
I do not even know what exactly happened anymore.	Ik wit net iens mear wat der krekt bard is.
It was not as if she really wanted to see any of them.	It wie net oft se wier ien fan har sjen woe.
Life is so beautiful.	It libben is sa moai.
I'm trying to help.	Ik besykje te helpen.
She had been in there.	Se hie der yn west.
So was my family.	Sa wie myn famylje.
He set up.	Hy sette op.
That's an idea.	Dat is in idee.
She deals with people every day.	Se docht alle dagen mei minsken.
So there are many, many questions.	Dat d'r binne in protte, in protte fragen.
No money needed.	Gjin jild nedich.
A way to get what you want.	In manier om te krijen wat jo wolle.
By that time, many people will know who she is.	Tsjin dy tiid sille in protte minsken witte wa't se is.
I could not eat.	Ik koe net ite.
I have looked to this for help.	Ik haw sjoen nei dit foar help.
Arrive on time for work.	Kom op tiid foar wurk.
There is some truth to being said	Der is wat wierheid oan it sizzen
he asked.	hy frege.
I want you to think about tomorrow.	Ik wol dat jo tinke oan moarn.
I had to wait a few more days.	Ik moast noch in pear dagen wachtsje.
It will not be expected of us either.	It sil fan ús ek net ferwachte wurde.
I do not want anyone to see this.	Ik wol net dat ien dit sjocht.
He does not want a party or anything.	Hy wol gjin feest of sa.
Join me.	Doch mei my oan.
They ask everyone, house to house.	Se freegje elkenien, hûs oan hûs.
You are free to go.	Jo binne frij om te gean.
If you are not happy, then try something else.	As jo ​​​​net bliid binne, besykje dan wat oars.
But we can not let it happen.	Mar wy kinne it net barre litte.
For us, we try to keep it in place.	Foar ús besykje wy it op syn plak te hâlden.
More than would be necessary.	Mear as soe it nedich wêze.
Do another one tomorrow.	Moarn noch ien dwaan.
They know it's coming.	Se witte dat it komt.
Today was much better.	Hjoed wie folle better.
It was easy to do.	It wie maklik te dwaan.
It seems that nothing has ever happened here.	It liket derop dat hjir ea neat bard is.
Things are going well.	Dingen geane goed.
Maybe he would talk to her.	Miskien soe er mei har prate.
Hope you like them !.	Hoopje dat jo se leuk fine!.
I have to agree.	Ik moat it iens wêze.
But the woman did not think so.	Mar dêr tocht de frou net oan.
I've seen it myself.	Ik haw it sels sjoen.
What he was.	Wat hy wie.
We're leaving tomorrow.	Wy geane moarn fuort.
But, well.	Mar, goed.
The boy always said what he actually thought.	De jonge sei altyd wat er eins tocht.
Caution! 	Foarsichtich!
You know you can talk to me or your mom about anything.	Jo witte dat jo mei my of jo mem oer alles prate kinne.
You have a good life ahead of you.	Jo hawwe in goed libben foar jo.
As early as we can go.	Sa betiid as wy kinne gean.
Many find that it is enough.	In protte fine dat it genôch is.
We have nothing.	Wy hawwe neat.
It would not be good, but then, nothing would.	It soe net goed wêze, mar dan, neat soe.
He wants me to sit.	Hy wol dat ik sit.
He left her there for three days without food.	Hy liet har dêr trije dagen sûnder iten.
And there it would not stop.	En dêr soe it net ophâlde.
I talked to her earlier today.	Ik praat earder hjoed mei har.
But it can not be otherwise.	Mar it kin net oars.
She wanted to make her life with you.	Se woe har libben mei dy meitsje.
Hope you like it !.	Hoopje dat jo it leuk fine!.
Is he.	Is hy.
What we just did.	Wat wy krekt dien hawwe.
She angrily returned the book.	Se joech lilk it boek werom.
I see you have not been told about it.	Ik sjoch dat jo dêr net oer ferteld binne.
I did not take them.	Ik naam se net.
But just can not.	Mar gewoan kin net.
Children get hurt.	Bern wurde sear.
Maybe in a year or two.	Miskien oer in jier as twa.
They're leaving.	Se geane fuort.
I love this place.	Ik hâld fan dit plak.
Do not know who, do not know how, do not know why.	Net witte wa, net witte hoe, net witte wêrom.
It was good to talk to her.	It wie goed om mei har te praten.
I took my seat and looked around.	Ik naam myn sit en seach om my hinne.
He will.	Hy sil.
It is not clear why this will help.	It is net dúdlik wêrom dit sil helpe.
Nice and easy.	Moai en maklik.
He is everything you were not.	Hy is alles wat jo net wiene.
That's the same thing we do now.	Dat is itselde dat wy no dogge.
This is true to life.	Dit is wier oan it libben.
She would never want to let him.	Se soe har nea wolle litte him.
That I had hoped.	Dat hie ik hope.
The car got better.	De auto waard better.
But they were.	Mar se wiene.
I felt too good to go back.	Ik fielde my te goed om werom te gean.
For us, it was easy money.	Foar ús wie it maklik jild.
I know it's him.	Ik wit dat it him is.
He just does not think about these things.	Hy tinkt gewoan net oan dizze dingen.
To put it in a word, they come.	Om it yn in wurd te sizzen, se komme.
He now thought of this woman.	Hy tocht no oan dizze frou.
The city was free.	De stêd wie frij.
So you have never seen it.	Sa hawwe jo it noait sjoen.
He had heard her talking.	Hy hie har praten heard.
But he somehow frees himself.	Mar hy makket him op ien of oare manier frij.
No one is in there.	Gjinien is der yn.
The time is coming.	De tiid komt der oan.
He did not want to ask.	Hy woe it net freegje.
It must be the same here.	It moat hjir itselde wêze.
But no one wanted to see it.	Mar nimmen woe it sjen.
Or to me.	Of oan my.
She says nothing bad about anyone.	Se seit neat min oer gjinien.
I can not believe that now.	Dat kin ik no net leauwe.
It will not be a problem for me.	It sil gjin probleem wêze foar my.
I wanted them.	Ik woe har hawwe.
We never knew what to do.	Wy wisten noait wat te dwaan.
Your saying does not make it so.	Jo sizzen makket it net sa.
She did try to get it.	Se hat wol besocht om it te krijen.
I've done this before.	Ik haw dien dit foar.
You can also do nothing.	Jo kinne ek neat dwaan.
He hopes he did the right thing.	Hy hope dat er it goede ding die.
Said it was true.	Sei it wie wier.
They would not hurt you.	Se soene jo net sear hawwe.
What we may think does not matter.	Wat wy tinke kinne makket neat út.
He can do the same for you today.	Hy kin hjoed itselde foar jo dwaan.
But he himself could do nothing about it.	Mar hy koe der sels neat oan dwaan.
I did not expect her to make friends with your mother.	Ik hie net ferwachte dat se freonen soe meitsje mei dyn mem.
This is what will happen now.	Dit is wat der no barre sil.
I see that today as it is the past, it becomes the past.	Ik sjoch dat it hjoed as it ferline is, it ferline wurdt.
His word would hold.	Syn wurd soe hâlde.
Not so much in a bad way.	Net sa folle op in minne manier.
That she was sure of.	Dat wie se wis fan.
This did not happen.	Dit barde net.
I can not speak now.	Ik kin no net prate.
It was my only hope.	It wie myn ienige hope.
What a beautiful place.	Wat in moai plak.
Very very difficult.	Hiel hiel dreech.
You've never said that much to me.	Jo hawwe noait safolle tsjin my sein.
I knew him well enough.	Ik koe him goed genôch.
It was the woman.	It wie de frou.
And that would be it.	En dat soe wêze.
Really good question.	Echt goede fraach.
I tried and tried.	Ik besocht en besocht.
And it can be good.	En it kin wêze goed.
What are we going to eat tonight?	Wat sille wy fannacht ite?
He had never done this before.	Hy hie dit noch noait earder dien.
Who felt that way.	Wa fielde der sa út.
I can not let him.	Ik kin him net litte.
Can't wait!	Kin hast net wachtsje!.
They want to be like that.	Se wolle sa wêze.
She did not know she had ever seen him open.	Se wist net dat se him ea iepen sjoen hie.
And what he realized, she realized.	En wat er realisearre, realisearre se.
Try the food and tell me what you think.	Besykje it iten en fertel my wat jo tinke.
I'm so late for work.	Ik bin sa let op it wurk.
Only not today.	Allinnich net hjoed.
He shook my hand again.	Hy joech my wer de hân.
She would like it.	Se soe it leuk fine.
She knew she had not gotten him.	Se wist dat se him net krigen hie.
She would not stop.	Se soe net ophâlde.
The problem is finding them.	It probleem is om se te finen.
It looks good if you do it that way.	It sjocht der goed út as jo it sa dogge.
Maybe she did not even know it.	Miskien wist se it sels net.
Have a few.	Hawwe in pear.
And he's good.	En hy is goed.
Today was no different.	Hjoed wie net oars.
That's more than one man can handle.	Dat is mear as ien man oan kin.
That you do this.	Dat jo dit dogge.
You know, so often.	Jo witte, sa faak.
Mar! 	Mar!
I'm a friend.	Ik bin in freon.
I was not happy at all.	Ik wie hielendal net bliid.
For some reason, the door would not open.	Om ien of oare reden soe de doar net iepen gean.
This is just water here.	Dit is hjir gewoan wetter.
I love reading.	Ik hâld fan lêzen.
Money, he says.	Jild, seit er.
And do not worry about them.	En meitsje jo gjin soargen oer har.
This just works.	Dit wurket gewoan.
He never ran anything.	Hy hat noait wat rûn.
There had to be something to give.	Der moast wat jaan.
I wish he did not look so much like his father.	Ik winskje dat er net sa folle op syn heit like.
He was the father.	Hy wie de heit.
I had not seen him for thirty years.	Ik hie him tritich jier net sjoen.
He heard something.	Hy hearde wat.
It was my thing.	It wie myn ding.
That's really hard.	Dat is echt dreech.
Maybe they know where she went.	Miskien witte se wêr't se gie.
But you're sick.	Mar do bist siik.
Someone not her mother.	Immen net har mem.
He wanted to be that boy.	Hy woe dy jonge wêze.
That's the first thing.	Dat is it earste ding.
She never thought about it.	Se hat it noait tocht.
We'll see what happens.	Wy sille sjen wat der bart.
You will regret it.	Jo sille it spyt hawwe.
It's the same as with you.	It is itselde as mei dy.
I still know the dog but do not know his name.	Ik wit noch de hûn mar wit syn namme net.
He lived through.	Hy wenne troch.
Make it different.	Meitsje it oars.
Water bought away.	Wetter kocht fuort.
You can make whatever you want out of it.	Jo kinne der fan meitsje wat jo wolle.
We need you to come with us.	Wy hawwe jo nedich om mei ús te kommen.
I do not think they knew anything.	Ik tink net dat se wat wisten.
He had seen her come and go.	Hy hie har kommen en gean sjoen.
You think a little more.	Jo tinke wat mear.
He did not eat for a few days.	Hy iet in pear dagen net.
She does not want to go.	Se wol net gean.
I do not think they are.	Ik tink net dat se binne.
But there was no having her.	Mar der wie gjin hawwen har.
For a long time no one said a word.	Lang sei nimmen in wurd.
But there is still a problem at hand.	Mar d'r is noch in probleem oan 'e hân.
You are never done.	Jo binne nea dien.
There's something that happens.	Der is wat dat bart.
I can't see you.	Ik kin dy net sjen.
I had to wake him up.	Ik moast him wekker meitsje.
He's a bad boy.	Hy is in minne jonge.
I was there twice a month for two years.	Ik wie der twa kear yn 'e moanne foar twa jier.
No one had bought it for me.	Nimmen hie him foar my kocht.
It's just something about him.	It is gewoan wat oer him.
I can not have.	Ik kin net hawwe.
I was not sure they would believe me.	Ik wie der net wis fan dat se my leauwe soene.
I did not eat today.	Ik haw hjoed net iten.
We need it now.	Wy hawwe it no nedich.
No one, never.	Nimmen, nea.
He tried to talk, but nothing came out.	Hy besocht te praten, mar der kaam neat út.
Let's make things happen, they say.	Lit ús dingen meitsje, sizze se.
And that's exactly what's happening now.	En dat is no krekt wat der bart.
But it was too late.	Mar it wie te min te let.
He had to get out of there.	Hy moast der út.
The reason may be the following.	De reden kin de folgjende wêze.
A very good one.	In hiel goede ien.
Everyone does it now.	Elkenien docht it no.
If you like this, fine.	As jo ​​​​dizze leuk fine, goed.
Who said something.	Dy't wat sei.
I'm so happy for you.	Ik bin sa bliid foar dy.
They have one more chance to get it right.	Se hawwe noch ien kâns om it goed te krijen.
Though it will not be easy to get there.	Al sil it net maklik wêze om dêr te kommen.
I had to be on time for school.	Ik moast op 'e tiid wêze foar de skoalle.
In other words, it's hard.	Mei oare wurden, it is dreech.
At first it was very good.	Earst wie it hiel goed.
This is not going to be nice.	Dit wurdt net moai.
Or it could be something else.	Of it kin wat oars wêze.
There's no way I'll ever go back to her.	D'r is gjin manier dat ik oait werom nei har sil gean.
Continue to the next door.	Gean troch nei de folgjende doar.
It's not your time.	It is net dyn tiid.
But he was good.	Mar hy wie goed.
All that work, for nothing.	Al dat wurk, foar neat.
He could not do that.	Hy koe dat net dwaan.
I have no idea why this does not work.	Ik haw gjin idee wêrom dit net wurket.
Good for us.	Goed foar ús.
I already found.	Ik haw al fûn.
Of course, that will not happen.	Fansels sil dat net barre.
But not my father.	Mar net myn heit.
As if there was a way to stop her.	As wie der in manier om har tsjin te hâlden.
This is old.	Dit is âld.
Wait for what will happen then.	Wachtsje op wat der dan barre sil.
There were parents here too.	Der wiene hjir ek âlden.
There is too much, too much to do.	Der bart te folle, te folle om te dwaan.
I'm not leaving.	Ik gean der net fan wei.
Then something else.	Dan noch wat.
She also got one.	Se krige der ek ien.
She kept going.	Se bleau troch.
I could not do it, until now.	Ik koe it net dwaan, oant no ta.
She would even see what happened.	Se soe sels sjen wat der barde.
Her mother lived with her.	Har mem wenne by har.
But it's still nothing to do with me.	Mar it is noch neat mei my te krijen.
I try to do it that way.	Ik besykje it sa te dwaan.
What he had said was that she had to do what she could.	Wat er sein hie, wie dat se dwaan moast wat se mocht.
Then he leaves the room.	Dan giet er de keamer út.
I thought he did a really good job there.	Ik tocht dat hy dêr in echt goed wurk die.
She really loves it.	Se hâldt it echt.
I doubt it, but maybe.	Ik twifelje der oan, mar miskien.
So it goes on with food.	Sa giet it troch mei iten.
It was his best year.	It wie syn bêste jier.
But if you can, make it work for you.	Mar as jo kinne, meitsje it foar jo wurkje.
Take it one day at a time.	Nim it ien dei op in tiid.
You just do not have.	Jo hawwe gewoan net.
He did not show up.	Hy liet net sjen.
You have to go.	Jo moatte fuort.
She would ask him to leave.	Se soe him freegje om fuort te gean.
I thought about that.	Dêr tocht ik oan.
Of course she knew.	Fansels wist se.
You can not win.	Jo kinne net winne.
There is still something, but it does not open easily.	Der is noch wat, mar it giet net maklik iepen.
And so he can.	En sa kin er.
Not even a bit.	Net iens in bytsje.
She is still happy.	Se is noch altyd bliid.
You're not there yet.	Do bist der noch net.
One is, try it and see.	Ien is, besykje it en sjoch.
I can just tell.	Ik kin gewoan fertelle.
She was the only one who did it.	Se wie de ienige dy't it die.
Never had it off with her, mind.	Nea hie it ôf mei har, tink.
He loves you.	Hy hâldt fan dy.
I looked at the house.	Ik seach nei it hûs.
For two days.	Foar twa dagen.
I have to be here.	Ik moat hjir wêze.
I have to go.	Ik moat gean.
No one did.	Gjinien die.
I have had enough of all this!	Ik haw genôch fan dit alles!
And so much pain.	En safolle sear.
There could be no other reason.	Der koe gjin oare reden wêze.
It was his life.	It wie syn libben.
They were one and the same person.	Se wiene ien en deselde persoan.
Who could take care of me.	Wa koe foar my soargje.
Or so she thought.	Of sa tocht se.
And you got it.	En do hast it.
But she was here now.	Mar se wie hjir no.
She knew he would not tell her anything.	Se wist dat er har neat fertelle soe.
No problems there.	Gjin problemen dêr.
He asked him too.	Hy frege him ek ôf.
She is a teacher, and she loves her job.	Se is in learaar, en se hâldt fan har wurk.
What would that be like.	Wat soe dat leuk wêze.
She never talked much about you.	Se hat noait in protte oer dy praat.
We need more.	Wy moatte mear.
But surely nothing else will.	Mar wis neat oars sil.
I did not ask it.	Ik frege it net.
It was still a house, but it was more than that.	It wie noch in hûs, mar it wie mear as dat.
They are probably just as happy where they are.	Se binne wierskynlik like bliid wêr't se binne.
I would like us to go over the people.	Ik soe graach wolle dat wy oer de minsken geane.
It’s not about how many things you have.	It giet net oer hoefolle dingen jo hawwe.
You love it.	Jo hâlde it.
It does no good.	It docht gjin goed.
He had decided on it and he was done forever.	Hy hie der oer besletten en hy wie foar altyd dien.
Give them more of what they want.	Jou har mear fan wat se wolle.
We never had much money.	Wy hiene nea folle jild.
What has gone before is done.	Wat earder gien is, wurdt dien.
Whether we need it or not, we need to buy it.	Oft wy it nedich binne of net, wy moatte it keapje.
There was nothing else to say.	Der wie neat oars te sizzen.
Glad to talk about everything.	Bliid om oer alles te praten.
I ate them well.	Ik haw se iten goed.
He just did not know how much.	Hy wist gewoan net hoefolle.
She does not talk much.	Se praat net folle.
Of course my car was fine.	Fansels wie myn auto goed.
Let him go and.	Lit him mar gean en.
This is how we should do it.	Dit is hoe't wy it moatte dwaan.
We saw that earlier this year.	Dat hawwe wy earder dit jier sjoen.
You were real.	Jo wiene echt.
You did not ask for it.	Do hast der net om frege.
This is your last chance.	Dit is dyn lêste kâns.
I would never be able to talk to any of them again.	Ik soe noait wer mei ien fan har prate kinne.
What is today.	Wat is hjoed.
Maybe they did not read it.	Miskien hawwe se it net lêzen.
But they had nothing to do with it.	Mar se hiene der neat oan.
He did it for his mother.	Hy die it foar syn mem.
That was not so.	Dat wie net sa.
I have to tell you this, okay.	Ik moat dy dit fertelle, goed.
I'm glad you're here with me.	Ik bin bliid dat jo hjir by my binne.
No one told.	Gjinien ferteld.
But that did not happen.	Mar dat kaam net troch.
Life was good again.	It libben wie wer goed.
You can go with whatever you want.	Jo kinne gean mei wat jo wolle.
I just can not get enough.	Ik kin gewoan net genôch krije.
He asked me to go in with him.	Hy frege my om by him yn te gean.
What a man.	Wat in man.
That did not happen.	Dat is net bard.
That would be my father.	Dat soe myn heit wêze.
I know this would not be enough.	Ik wit dat dit net genôch wêze soe.
Living here is really the best we can do.	Hjir wenje is echt it bêste dat wy kinne dwaan.
We did not know what to do.	Wy wisten net wat te dwaan.
And he was not worried.	En hy wie gjin soargen.
But he knew it was not.	Mar hy wist dat it net wie.
But I have not found it yet.	Mar ik haw it noch net fûn.
That was all for me.	Dat wie my alles.
I could find nothing.	Ik koe neat fine.
She was at work early to get ready for the day.	Se wie betiid oan it wurk om har klear te meitsjen foar de dei.
That's my first.	Dat is myn earste.
We make friends soon.	Wy meitsje freonen gau.
Never will happen.	Nea sil barre.
His family was just nice to her.	Syn famylje wie gewoan aardich foar har.
Maybe even a month.	Miskien sels in moanne.
You better go without us.	Jo kinne better sûnder ús gean.
My whole family will do it.	Myn hiele famylje sil it dwaan.
Nothing is good or bad.	Neat is goed of min.
But we are not.	Mar wy binne net.
What do they know ?.	Wat witte se?.
I will make you happy.	Ik sil dy bliid meitsje.
They talk at length about their children.	Se prate lang oer har bern.
He should not even think about it.	Hy moat it net iens tinke.
They are best friends.	Se binne bêste freonen.
I want to do something different.	Ik wol wat oars dwaan.
Maybe she does more, or maybe she does it differently.	Miskien docht se mear, of miskien docht se it oars.
We can not eat at your home today.	Wy kinne hjoed net by jo thús ite.
Who knew what my mother was like.	Wa wist hoe't myn mem wie.
I love the baby.	Ik hâld fan it bern.
He could tell her, but he did not.	Hy koe it har fertelle, mar hy die it net.
Just out of school.	Krekt út skoalle.
Everyone said it.	Elkenien sei it.
So they are going to resist.	Sa geane se har tsjin te hâlden.
I even heard nothing of the sort.	Ik hearde sels neat fan dat soarte.
We know where you've been.	Wy witte wêr't jo west hawwe.
You know it from the day he bought the place.	Jo witte it sûnt de dei dat hy it plak kocht.
Who would be us.	Wa soe ús wêze.
You are life to me.	Do bist it libben foar my.
Go with it.	Gean der mei oan.
I do not know.	Ik wit net.
I had a lot to tell him.	Ik hie him in protte te fertellen.
They are expected.	Se wurde ferwachte.
Anyone can show up here.	Elkenien kin hjir sjen litte.
This has actually never happened.	Dit is eins nea bard.
Not now or never.	Net no of nea.
He could never really tell, not anymore.	Hy koe it noait echt fertelle, net mear.
I'd done with it.	Ik haw der mei dien.
Tomorrow you get the boy.	Moarn krije jo de jonge.
I could see him over and over again.	Ik koe him oer en wer sjen.
But something seems different.	Mar wat liket oars.
The other two do not.	De oare twa net.
The man needed a hand.	De man hie in hân nedich.
He wanted to be both.	Hy woe beide wêze.
You scare people.	Jo meitsje minsken bang.
They will come to you.	Se sille nei dy komme.
The plan worked well.	It plan wurke goed.
It's really good.	It is echt goed.
He liked the man.	Hy mocht de man graach.
But they got help.	Mar se krigen help.
I need everyone there.	Ik haw elkenien dêr nedich.
I do not see how that will help.	Ik sjoch net hoe't dat sil helpe.
Come back.	Kom werom.
She was not his mother.	Se wie syn mem net.
She did a great job of that.	Dêr die se moai wurk fan.
Other people are not doing this right now.	Oare minsken dogge dit no net yn.
They are more likely to be friends.	Se binne mear kâns te wêzen freonen.
Or the same.	Of itselde.
Who we were.	Wa't wy wiene.
That's one of my favorite things to say.	Dat is ien fan myn favorite dingen om te sizzen.
What was her name.	Wat wie har namme.
It was not likely.	It wie net wierskynlik.
That's what you'll do.	Dat sille jo dwaan.
She must be.	Se moat wêze.
Do not want to see you, she said.	Wol dy net sjen, sei se.
Do they have money?	Hawwe se jild?
That should help a lot.	Dat soe in protte helpe moatte.
I have a large family.	Ik haw in grutte famylje.
I will not be here anymore.	Ik sil hjir net mear wêze.
I did not want that to get out of hand.	Ik woe net dat dat út de hân gie.
They do not have many friends.	Se hawwe net folle freonen.
Good work does not stand on its own.	Goed wurk stiet net op himsels.
I bought it and she took it from me.	Ik kocht it en se naam it fan my.
Then visit one day a week.	Besykje dan ien dei yn 'e wike.
Doing well at school seems easy.	Goed dwaan op skoalle liket maklik.
But that is also for another day.	Mar dat is ek foar in oare dei.
We have no one to deal with.	Wy hawwe gjinien om mei te dwaan.
It's not good either.	It is ek net goed.
I really want this more than anything.	Ik wol dit echt mear as wat dan ek.
It becomes clear that something needs to be done about it.	It wurdt dúdlik dat der wat oan dien wurde moat.
That's easy.	Dat is maklik.
Sa.	Sa.
It's so beautiful.	It is sa moai.
We have the following photo.	Wy hawwe de folgjende foto.
They need to get you out of here.	Se moatte jo hjir wei krije.
There was no help for that.	Dêr wie gjin help foar.
We're leaving tomorrow.	Wy geane moarn fuort.
My favorite book is this.	Myn favorite boek is dit.
Really happy for her.	Echt bliid foar har.
This was his life.	Dit wie syn libben.
He can talk too.	Hy kin ek prate.
We need to do better.	Wy moatte it better dwaan.
I worked for it.	Ik wurke der foar.
I liked going there.	Ik mocht der graach hinne.
It should take time.	It moat tiid nimme.
It was good for now.	It wie goed foar no.
Do not go there.	Gean der net hinne.
The boy was so happy.	De jonge wie sa bliid.
Otherwise, it's time to find a new movie.	Oars is it tiid om in nije film te finen.
It has only become bad once.	It is mar ien kear min wurden.
She's really not sure she can do this.	Se is echt net wis dat se dit kin dwaan.
That was never true before.	Dat wie eartiids noait wier.
Maybe it was okay though.	Miskien wie it wol goed.
But he never did anything.	Mar hy hat noait wat dien.
It was her last letter to her husband.	It wie har lêste brief oan har man.
I'm sure.	Ik wis bin.
She had not told me.	Se hie it my net ferteld.
Try to figure out the way.	Besykje de wei út te finen.
But there was no way back.	Mar der wie gjin wei werom.
Nobody actually says that.	Nimmen seit dat eins.
And in everyone.	En yn elkenien.
We have this.	Wy hawwe dit.
Go we will.	Gean wy sille.
They do not look like.	Se lykje net.
He keeps it pretty good.	Hy hâldt it aardich goed.
These are you for me, I for him.	Dit binne jo foar my, ik foar him.
This is what you do not want to do.	Dit is wat jo net wolle dwaan.
It was too much to keep up with.	It wie te folle om yn te hâlden.
But it did not.	Mar it die dat net.
I hope this was fun.	Ik hoopje dat dit leuk wie.
I was really surprised.	Ik wie echt ferrast.
He did not want to give anything away.	Hy woe hjir neat fan jaan.
That should be the job done.	Dat soe it wurk dien wurde moatte.
From you, if it can.	Fan jo, as it kin.
He knew they knew something he did not know.	Hy wist dat se wat wisten dat hy net wist.
You will take care of them.	Jo sille soargje foar har.
Just look at you.	Sjoch dy mar.
We really let her do her thing.	Wy litte har echt har ding dwaan.
But nothing is easy here.	Mar neat is hjir maklik.
I can give you nothing.	Ik kin dy neat jaan.
I know his mother.	Ik ken syn mem.
So we have to work twice as hard.	Sa moatte wy twa kear sa hurd wurkje.
Can you believe this is the first day of school?	Kinne jo leauwe dat dit de earste dei fan skoalle is?
Very few people have such a life.	Hiel pear minsken hawwe sa'n libben.
If they do not, that is fine too.	As se dat net dogge, is dat ek goed.
.	.
She did not know she was.	Se wist net dat se it wie.
It's good if you do not want to talk.	It is goed as jo net prate wolle.
Life goes on.	It libben giet troch.
What he does, no one else does.	Wat hy docht, gjinien oars docht it.
He might stop for a long time.	Hy sil miskien noch lang ophâlde.
That should be soon.	Dat moat dan gau.
I had never heard of him.	Ik hie nea fan him heard.
Must see a whole picture.	Moatte sjen in hiele foto.
Now the question is, how?	No is de fraach, hoe?
I am very very happy.	Ik bin hiel hiel bliid.
She works really hard.	Se wurket echt hurd.
Make more and more money.	Meitsje mear en mear jild.
They are all gone.	Se binne allegear fuort.
You can do anything else with him but not love him.	Jo kinne alles oars mei him dwaan, mar net fan him hâlde.
He would not let it happen.	Hy soe it net barre litte.
This is her last chance.	Dit is har lêste kâns.
Okay, you met him.	Goed, jo moete him.
I just know it.	Ik wit it gewoan.
Your mother was beautiful.	Dyn mem wie moai.
It's not up to me.	It is net oan my.
I could handle it.	Ik koe der wol mei oan.
People just do not get it.	Minsken krije it gewoan net.
He will wait.	Hy sil wachtsje.
He never liked you.	Hy hat dy noait leuk.
Let us see who you are.	Lit ús sjen wa't jo binne.
We're old.	Wy binne âld.
Not that he ever would.	Net dat er oait soe.
There were only two of them now.	It wiene se no mar twa.
We got a life and class.	Wy krigen in libben en klasse.
He had been in town three days, but here it was again.	Hy hie trije dagen yn 'e stêd west, mar hjir wie it wer.
He clearly has something.	Hy hat dúdlik wat.
There was another class left.	Der wie noch in oare klasse oer.
People could see, but they would not be able to see them.	Minsken koene sjen, mar se soene har net sjen kinne.
She's not good at all.	Se is hielendal net goed.
We want her to be happy.	Wy wolle dat se bliid is.
I want to see him at work.	Ik wol him oan it wurk sjen.
Well then, he said.	No dan, sei er.
The truth was different.	De wierheid wie oars.
Under the bed.	Ûnder it bêd.
Now as happy as the day is long.	No sa bliid as de dei lang is.
Work my way back.	Wurkje myn wei werom.
But she never told you the truth.	Mar se hat dy noait de wierheid ferteld.
I walked into the house.	Ik rûn it hûs yn.
Now he was sure of it.	No wie er der wis fan.
And that's kind of what we're trying to do.	En dat is sa'n bytsje wat wy besykje te dwaan.
His parents need to be told everything.	Syn âlden moatte alles ferteld wurde.
They are here today, they are gone tomorrow.	Se binne hjir hjoed, se binne fuort moarn.
You're so good.	Do bist sa goed.
In the last week before she died.	Yn 'e lêste wike foardat se stoar.
She would not make it.	Se soe it net meitsje.
What had happened, they knew.	Wat der bard wie, wisten se.
It's the past.	It is it ferline.
They just come at me.	Se komme gewoan op my.
Right there, keep it right there.	Krekt dêr, hâld it dêr krekt.
He keeps it out to me.	Hy hâldt it my út.
That's why we're here.	It is wêrom wy hjir binne.
So tired .	Sa wurch .
It was no chance.	It wie gjin kâns.
What kind of food, how much food.	Wat foar iten, hoefolle iten.
But he can not.	Mar hy kin net.
You know it when it happens to you.	Jo witte it as it bart mei dy.
And he found it.	En hy fûn it.
No big return.	Gjin grutte werom.
It worked this time.	It wurke dizze kear.
Everything else is easy.	Al it oare is maklik.
Many are the same.	In protte is itselde.
It's for everyone.	It is foar elkenien.
She had no worries about it.	Se hie der gjin soargen oer.
I feel nothing for him.	Ik fiel neat foar him.
Come on, no.	Kom op, no.
But no one will ever know.	Mar nimmen sil dat oait witte.
It's a day or two.	It is in dei as twa.
He gave up nothing or no one.	Hy joech neat of gjinien op.
We do not work.	Wy wurkje net.
He wanted to go to school.	Hy woe nei skoalle.
Not that she would ever tell him that.	Net dat se him dat oait fertelle soe.
That is what we believe and want to know.	Dat is wat wy leauwe en wolle wy witte.
I could not do them.	Ik koe se net dwaan.
But that's where the good things really happen.	Mar dat is wêr't de goede dingen echt bart.
Better in a way.	Better op in manier.
You find it or not.	Jo fine it of net.
And he knows me.	En hy ken my.
That people had seen this happen.	Dat minsken dit barre sjoen hiene.
Better that it with.	Better dat it mei.
I'll do it right.	Ik sil it goede dwaan.
He thought he could help.	Hy tocht dat er helpe koe.
The young girl got a bike in the way.	It jonge famke kaam in fyts yn 'e wei.
Go and get one.	Gean en krije ien.
Then there is one last problem.	Dan is der in lêste probleem.
Everyone around here knows it.	Elkenien om hjir hinne wit it.
Everyone has this.	Elkenien hat dizze.
She did not look up once.	Se seach net ien kear op.
Does anyone have an idea why this is happening.	Hat immen in idee wêrom dit bart.
I walked almost an hour late.	Ik rûn hast in oere te let.
Or the latter.	Of de lêste.
But there is a reason for that.	Mar d'r is in reden foar.
Allow them to see through it.	Lit har om it troch te sjen.
And so do your children.	En dat dogge jo bern ek.
Or will not do.	Of sil net dwaan.
Not sure what to do.	Net wis wat te dwaan.
My father even lived at home.	Myn heit hat sels thús wenne.
If you want, we can do it here.	As jo ​​​​wolle, kinne wy ​​it hjir dwaan.
It was the weekend.	It wie it wykein.
Maybe he did.	Miskien hat er it dien.
The water was alive.	It wetter wie libben.
I wish he hadn’t.	Ik woe dat er net hie.
They would not let me.	Se soene my net litte litte.
He was fine at the time.	Hy hie it yn dy tiid goed.
He will stay here for two weeks.	Hy sil hjir twa wike bliuwe.
I bought that for you.	Ik kocht dat foar dy.
I do not like this idea either.	Ik hâld fan dit idee ek net.
But what if.	Mar wat as.
I will buy more !.	Ik sil keapje mear !.
Probably they love making it to see you.	Wierskynlik hâlden se fan it meitsjen om jo te sjen.
There I am with you.	Dêr bin ik mei dy.
He could not do without her.	Hy koe net sûnder har.
I'll take her room.	Ik sil har keamer nimme.
Nobody likes to do this work.	Nimmen hâldt fan dit wurk te dwaan.
You talk when you have to.	Jo prate as jo net moatte.
She thought she might be that person.	Se tocht dat se miskien dy persoan wêze koe.
That would work for me.	Dat soe foar my wurkje.
The people are coming.	De minsken komme.
They are quite common in the big city.	Se binne frij gewoan yn 'e grutte stêd.
Look out.	Sjoch út.
She heard the words.	Se hearde de wurden.
You talk to her best.	Jo prate it bêste mei har.
How much money do you have on you?	Hoefolle jild hawwe jo op jo?
We're a little angry that we'll let this happen.	Wy binne wat lilk dat wy it sa komme litte.
You're leaving tonight.	Jo geane fannacht.
She knew who was there without looking up.	Se wist wa't der wie sûnder op te sjen.
The truth is pretty clear.	De wierheid is frij dúdlik.
One that you might like.	Ien dy't jo miskien leuk fine.
Another man who seems to have the time of his life.	In oare man dy't de tiid fan syn libben liket te hawwen.
We will look around us today.	Wy sille hjoed om ús hinne sjen.
What? 	Wat?
They have a lot.	Se hawwe in protte.
He can even take a day off tomorrow.	Hy kin moarn sels in dei frij nimme.
She said she would visit him.	Se sei dat se by him besykje soe.
Now of course we know better.	No witte wy fansels better.
But this can happen.	Mar dit kin barre.
An old man entered the school.	In âld man kaam de skoalle yn.
Otherwise she would have been here days before she was found.	Oars hie se hjir dagen west foardat se fûn waard.
Sit back, sit back.	Sit werom, sit werom.
I'm hoping for the best.	Ik hoopje op it goede.
She would not ask if it was okay.	Se soe net freegje oft it goed wie.
But it was more.	Mar it wie mear.
All on its own.	Alles op himsels.
They need to get better than they are.	Se moatte better wurde as se binne.
We need to do the same.	Wy moatte itselde dwaan.
You have to work on it every day.	Jo moatte der alle dagen oan wurkje.
Maybe he's making something up for me.	Miskien makket er wat foar my op.
One day she tried to take me home.	Op in dei besocht se myn thús te nimmen.
Now we can see what works and what does not work.	No kinne wy ​​sjen wat wurket en wat net wurket.
As you wish.	Sa as jo winskje.
He wasn’t much to look at, really.	Hy wie net folle om nei te sjen, echt.
He was not like that.	Hy wie net sa.
Another way.	Noch in manier.
And that they were clearly the work of the same people.	En dat se dúdlik it wurk wiene fan deselde minsken.
That's how to do it.	Dat is hoe te dwaan.
They are both wrong.	Se binne beide ferkeard.
And she just took to you.	En se naam gewoan nei dy.
You can do this too.	Jo kinne dit ek dwaan.
You're having a great day tomorrow.	Jo hawwe moarn in grutte dei.
There was nothing to do about it.	Wie der neat oan te dwaan.
I needed a few hours not to be scared.	Ik hie in pear oeren nedich om net bang te wêzen.
We need to have a reason.	Wy moatte in reden hawwe.
She took her time to come.	Se naam har tiid om te kommen.
And he can be.	En hy kin wêze.
We need a few things.	Wy hawwe in pear dingen nedich.
If your friend needs to talk about it, she'll talk about it.	As jo ​​​​freon der oer prate moat, sil se der oer prate.
She wanted to take it back.	Se woe it werom nimme.
I should help with that.	Dêr soe ik mei helpe moatte.
Maybe you should try something different.	Miskien moatte jo wat oars besykje.
I do not want to be friends with you.	Ik wol gjin freonen mei dy wêze.
But it makes me.	Mar it makket my.
He had three children.	Hy hie trije bern.
So we set to work.	Sa sette wy oan it wurk.
The father returned from work.	De heit kaam werom fan it wurk.
I'm thinking of taking a job here.	Ik tink om hjir in baan te nimmen.
But it was still difficult.	Mar it wie noch altyd dreech.
I could not get enough of it.	Ik koe der net genôch fan krije.
Will probably be back to get much more.	Sil wierskynlik werom wêze om folle mear te krijen.
I do not know yet.	Ik wit it noch net.
But this time it was different.	Mar dizze kear wie it oars.
She did it too well.	Se hat it te goed dien.
She was sure of it.	Se wie der wis fan.
We do not have to help you anymore.	Wy hoege jo net mear te helpen.
I've never seen one before.	Ik haw noch noait ien sjoen.
I know what time it is.	Ik wit hoe let it is.
Things happen the way they do.	Dingen barre hoe't se barre.
They need to talk.	Se moatte prate.
There was well.	Der wie wol.
You just hurt him over and over again.	Jo dogge him gewoan wer en wer sear.
And that is now.	En dat is no.
Not without the man.	Net sûnder de man.
No one was allowed to leave us alone, not even me.	Nimmen mocht ús allinnich litte, ik sels net.
He stayed with the police.	Hy bleau by de plysje.
I had never seen so beautiful in my life.	Ik hie noch noait sa moai yn myn libben sjoen.
Not after what just happened.	Net nei wat krekt bard is.
Need help.	Bin help nedich.
Life is life, food is just there.	It libben is it libben, iten is der gewoan.
These are two things that go together.	Dit binne twa dingen dy't tegearre geane.
She knew she was beautiful.	Se wist dat se moai wie.
There we would grow old together.	Dêr soene wy ​​tegearre âld wurde.
It was not pretty.	It wie net moai.
And you almost never get to those things anymore.	En jo komme hast net mear op dy dingen.
You do not have to anymore.	Jo moatte net mear.
We need to play better here.	Wy moatte hjir better spylje.
You want to be a little careful.	Jo wolle in bytsje foarsichtich wêze.
There were not many people out.	Der wiene net folle minsken út.
It really hurt.	It die echt sear.
I just do not know how to deal with it.	Ik wit gewoan net hoe ik der mei oan moat.
Everything works so well together.	Alles wurket sa goed tegearre.
I'll come back to that.	Ik kom der op werom.
You want to ask them.	Jo wolle se freegje.
I know he needs me.	Ik wit dat hy my nedich hat.
It did not seem likely.	It like net wierskynlik.
This is the job he wanted.	Dit is de baan dy't hy woe.
She told me to get away.	Se fertelde my om fuort te kommen.
And to have someone tell you that.	En om der ien te hawwen dy't jo dat fertelle.
Dad does not know very well what he has to do to help.	Heit wit net sa goed wat er dwaan moat om te helpen.
I could not have asked for anything better.	Ik koe net hawwe frege om neat better.
Your man on.	Jo man op.
But somehow she could not.	Mar op ien of oare manier koe se net.
No worries, much more where that came from.	Gjin soargen, folle mear wêr't dat wei kaam.
Nobody says go tomorrow.	Nimmen seit moarn gean.
We do not know who they are, or where they come from.	Wy witte net wa't se binne, of wêr't se wei komme.
He could say nothing.	Hy koe neat sizze.
It can even be early.	It kin sels betiid wêze.
He looks too pretty for her.	Hy sjocht har te moai út.
You are not worried.	Jo binne net soargen.
She waited until he said something.	Se wachte oant er wat sei.
There are some things you never get to do.	D'r binne wat dingen dy't jo noait komme om te dwaan.
She just knows nothing.	Se wit gewoan neat.
We're making good money now.	Wy meitsje no goed jild.
We can stay.	Wy kinne bliuwe.
I would give her everything.	Ik soe har alles jaan.
You need to do it soon.	Jo moatte it gau dwaan.
They were talking about how things looked.	Se hiene it oer hoe't dingen like.
But maybe it's not as difficult as it seems.	Mar miskien is it net sa dreech as it liket.
Of course, it seemed for quite some time now that this was not the case.	Fansels like it no frij lang dat it net sa wie.
So the police found him.	Sa fûn de plysje him.
But, best of all, his father did not.	Mar, it bêste fan alles, it hie syn heit net.
Now he would be there until tomorrow.	No soe er der wêze oant moarn.
Well, we have him.	No, wy hawwe him.
She came out and wanted to talk to me, but I left.	Se kaam út en woe mei my prate, mar ik gie fuort.
Well, let me help you.	No, lit my jo helpe.
But the time was up.	Mar de tiid wie derop.
Leave it for an hour.	Lit it foar in oere.
He did not.	Hy die it net.
He said nothing.	Hy sei neat.
People just did not know him.	Minsken koene him gewoan net.
I never knew her.	Ik koe har noait iens.
Just like everything in her house.	Krekt as alles yn har hûs.
He does not know better.	Hy wit net better.
All be nice to her.	Al wês aardich foar har.
He had told her the truth.	Hy hie har de wierheid ferteld.
Hope it goes well with you.	Hoopje dat it goed mei dy giet.
Go where you want to go.	Gean wêr't jo hinne wolle.
This mom needs me now.	Dizze mem hat my no nedich.
Which can be bad.	Wat kin wêze min.
The problem was, he could not tell.	It probleem wie, hy koe it net fertelle.
He was just a boy.	Hy wie mar in jonge.
She says nothing.	Se seit neat.
But many cannot do that.	Mar in protte kinne dat net dwaan.
And how many.	En hoefolle.
I had done that more for myself than for any other reason.	Ik hie dat mear foar my dien as om hokker oare reden.
Let him come with me to my place.	Lit him mei my nei myn plak komme.
Maybe you are not happy another time.	Miskien binne jo gjin oare kear bliid.
That he should know now.	Dat soe er no witte moatte.
I never met her mother.	Ik haw har mem noait moete.
You can come with me if you want.	Jo kinne mei my komme as jo wolle.
Very happy with.	Hiel bliid mei.
Never thought about it.	Nea tocht oer it.
Nobody has anything.	Nimmen hat wat.
As if someone was waiting.	As hie immen wachte.
And on.	En oan.
Go away!	Gean fuort!
I did not like.	Ik mocht net.
At school.	Op skoalle.
Things are coming up.	Dingen komme op.
You're not there yet.	Do bist der noch net.
I do not know what's wrong with them.	Ik wit net wat der mei har oan de hân is.
One of these days.	Ien fan dizze dagen.
Next they will come to me.	Folgjende sille se by my komme.
He can 't tell me where he's going.	Hy kin my net fertelle wêr't er hinne giet.
Does a dog go to the moon?	Giet in hûn de moanne?
I had no more words to say.	Ik hie gjin wurden mear te sizzen.
You get nothing.	Jo krije neat.
As he walked.	As hy rûn.
Of course she did not.	Fansels hie se net.
I love it even more this way.	Ik hâld der noch mear fan op dizze manier.
He does not have to.	Hy hoecht net.
Everyone was busy, but soon there would be someone with him.	Elkenien hie it drok, mar der soe gau ien by him wêze.
I just did not want to see them again.	Ik woe se gewoan net wer sjen.
I'm still pretty busy.	Ik bin noch aardich drok.
Nothing in, nothing out.	Neat yn, neat út.
It was time for work.	It wie tiid foar wurk.
Hope it goes well with you.	Hoopje dat it goed mei dy giet.
But that was difficult.	Mar dat wie dreech.
This had to be done.	Dit hie der te dwaan west.
Many get through there.	In protte komme dêr troch.
That was not good.	Dat wie net goed.
I need to see a movie.	Ik moat in film sjen.
Actually away after dinner.	Eins fuort nei it iten.
I did not worry about it and went on.	Ik makke my der gjin soargen oer en gie troch.
Said she had to leave.	Sei dat se fuort moast.
The word would not come to her.	It wurd soe net by har komme.
No other way could this happen.	Gjin oare manier koe dit barre.
We will both be happy.	Wy sille beide bliid wêze.
This time nothing happened.	Dizze kear is der neat bard.
You want to see him.	Jo wolle him sjen.
Not that money in itself is a bad thing.	Net dat jild op himsels in min ding is.
I would love to have it.	Ik soe it graach hawwe.
I came up with both.	Ik kaam op mei beide.
I'm a mother.	ik bin mem.
But somehow he had to leave.	Mar op ien of oare manier moast er fuort.
It is not the first to do so.	It is net de earste dy't dat docht.
If we only knew what that thing was, we would know it.	As wy gewoan wisten wat dat ding wie, dan soene wy ​​it witte.
She could not be sick.	Se koe net siik wêze.
We're really just friends.	Wy binne echt gewoan freonen.
She was beautiful.	Se wie moai.
And many, many more.	En in protte, folle mear.
Not sure if that has anything to do with it.	Net wis oft dat der wat mei te krijen hat.
I realized it was true.	Ik realisearre dat it wier wie.
It was good to see you again.	It wie goed om dy wer te sjen.
Stop, he said.	Hâld op, sei er.
I'm not sure it's good.	Ik bin der net wis fan dat it goed is.
I had long hair.	Ik hie lang hier.
Things will stay the same.	Dingen sille itselde bliuwe.
I ran for my life.	Ik rûn foar myn libben.
She should be back in a few days.	Se moat oer in pear dagen werom wêze.
I'm waiting to see what happens.	Ik wachtsje om te sjen wat der komt.
I'm not in jail.	Ik sit net yn 'e finzenis.
When are you always free?	Wannear binne jo altyd frij?
Just tell me what's going on with you.	Fertel my mar wat der mei dy bart.
The door was open.	De doar wie iepen.
He would just go and see.	Hy soe gewoan gean en sjen.
But people buy it.	Mar minsken keapje it.
Clearly it can not.	Dúdlik kin it net.
There was so much to do.	Der wie safolle te dwaan.
Good girl!	Goed famke!
Nobody knows why.	Nimmen wit wêrom.
It's a house.	It is in hûs.
This time was different.	Dizze kear wie oars.
She did not have it.	Se hat it net.
It's what you do.	It is wat jo dogge.
They were both good.	Se wiene beide goed.
He wants to go home, she says.	Hy wol nei hûs ta, seit se.
Nice thing.	Aardich wat.
That's the only way to go.	Dat is de ienige manier om te gean.
But she did not see them.	Mar se seach har net.
They do not come themselves.	Se komme net sels.
I know you know how.	Ik wit dat jo witte hoe.
That is not entirely true.	Dat is net hielendal wier.
We pay him.	Wy betelje him.
She did not find me.	Se hat my net fûn.
They were another kind of bad time.	Se wiene in oare soarte minne tiid.
She would tell your father soon.	Se soe it jo heit gau fertelle.
The work is the work of a woman.	It wurk is it wurk fan in frou.
The man thinks, cautiously.	De man tinkt, foarsichtich.
One is on or off.	Ien is derop of der ôf.
I saw his picture.	Ik haw syn foto sjoen.
Take it out.	Nim it út.
It came through.	Der kaam troch.
She could be sure of that.	Dêr koe se wis fan wêze.
He looked surprised.	Hy seach ferrast.
Maybe, after a few years, there would have been a way.	Miskien, nei in pear jier, soe der in manier west hawwe.
No way can we win two there.	Gjin manier kinne wy ​​winne twa dêr.
Caution!	Foarsichtich!
He also let me take a picture.	Hy liet my ek in foto meitsje.
If you were not.	As jo ​​net wiene.
They think it works for them.	Se tinke dat it foar har wurket.
I've never made it before.	Ik haw noch noait earder makke.
We will show you good time.	Wy sille jo goede tiid sjen litte.
She never talked to me.	Se hat noait mei my praat.
I can do the same.	Ik kin itselde dwaan.
The next he was gone.	De folgjende wie hy fuort.
There is no such thing.	Der is net sa'n ding.
The guy's family.	De famylje fan 'e keardel.
I could go now.	Ik koe no fuort.
Life was fun again.	It libben wie wer leuk.
Often it looks like nothing.	Faak liket it op neat.
But pretty much everything goes now.	Mar sa'n bytsje alles giet no.
It works for both.	It wurket foar beide.
If they were good enough, she could just leave them.	As se goed genôch wiene, koe se se gewoan litte.
I had one last question.	Ik hie in lêste fraach.
But please, be careful.	Mar asjebleaft, wês foarsichtich.
From now on you will come up with me.	Fan no ôf komme jo mei my op.
The kids are good.	De bern binne goed.
Keep it with you.	Hâld it mei dy.
It was necessary though.	It wie wol nedich.
And she wanted to do something.	En se woe wat dwaan.
He was never the same person again.	Hy wie nea wer deselde persoan.
I could not in the past.	Ik koe yn it ferline net.
He did not want to think about that.	Dêr woe er net oan tinke.
You have to do it.	Jo moatte it dwaan.
He has two of them.	Hy hat der twa fan.
But we will never know.	Mar wy sille it noait witte.
That could not be easy.	Dat koe net maklik wêze.
They said what.	Se seine wat.
I go back to you over and over again.	Ik gean werom nei dy oer en wer.
We have to look around that place for a long time.	Wy moatte lang om dat plak hinne sjen.
Waiting for a man to come home and love you.	Wachtsje op in man om thús te kommen en fan dy te hâlden.
She was tomorrow.	Se wie moarn.
Let us help.	Lit ús helpe.
They never thought it could be otherwise.	Se ha noait tocht dat it oars koe.
Works at our home.	Wurket by ús thús.
I got you.	Ik ha dy.
I let them work hard.	Ik lit se hurd wurkje.
There is not much more to say.	Der is net folle mear te sizzen.
But it was in trouble.	Mar it wie yn de problemen.
They put everything into being different.	Se sette alles yn om oars te wêzen.
And that should be enough.	En dat moat genôch wêze.
They would never be the same.	Se soene noait itselde wêze.
There are some things that are just right and wrong.	D'r binne wat dingen dy't gewoan goed en ferkeard binne.
This is my favorite time of the day.	Dit is myn favorite tiid fan de dei.
I think they are, but maybe not for everyone.	Ik tink dat se binne, mar miskien net foar elkenien.
He's fine tonight.	Hy is goed fannacht.
The only question is 'when'.	De ienige fraach is 'wannear'.
I thought they did.	Ik tocht dat se it diene.
But it was always there.	Mar it wie der altyd.
The people here are real.	De minsken binne hjir echt.
He did it well.	Hy die it goed.
That is not so for everyone.	Dat is net foar elkenien sa.
We do not want it to happen again.	Wy wolle it net wer barre.
We finished our work early today.	Wy hawwe ús wurk hjoed betiid klear.
I want to make sure they are good, whatever they are.	Ik wol der wis fan wêze dat se goed binne, wat se ek binne.
There is none.	Der is gjinien.
It's hard to see.	It is dreech om te sjen.
Your work, my husband.	Jo wurk, myn man.
He did not want to be there.	Hy woe der net by wêze.
It was never like that.	It wie noait sa.
Be as.	Wêze as.
And wants only one.	En wol mar ien.
But she got better, he said.	Mar se waard better, sei er.
There is more to it.	Der is mear oan.
We have to make it.	Wy moatte it meitsje.
It came out well.	It kaam goed út.
He was now really on his own.	Hy wie no echt op himsels.
Did not the father need any of us.	Wie de heit net ien fan ús nedich.
And the reason is clear.	En de reden is dúdlik.
So we can never know.	Sa kinne wy ​​nea witte.
The whole family is.	De hiele famylje is.
I was the same as you.	Ik wie itselde as dy.
It must be him.	It moat him wêze.
This is a beautiful house.	Dit is in moai hûs.
He knows what he can do.	Hy wit wat er dwaan kin.
And know that it is true.	En wit dat it wier is.
I do not know much about it.	Ik wit der net folle fan.
But they will be back soon.	Mar se komme gau wer werom.
I know someone.	Ik kin wol ien.
I know you'm scared.	Ik wit dat jo bang binne.
All he saw now was himself.	Alles wat er no seach wie himsels.
He touched nothing.	Hy rekke neat oan.
Many things happened.	Der barde in protte dingen.
It's my problem.	It is myn probleem.
He never did that to me.	Dat hat er my noait dien.
Next year this time they will have a baby.	Takom jier dizze kear krije se in bern.
They say something.	Se sizze wat.
Talk to us.	Praat mei ús.
I told him about you.	Ik fertelde him oer dy.
Could not worry about it now.	Koe der no gjin soargen oer meitsje.
I have exactly the same problem.	Ik haw krekt itselde probleem.
It has worked for me.	It hat wurke foar my.
One saw a house.	Ien seach in hûs.
It was exactly the same.	It wie krekt itselde.
Go from here to there.	Gean fan hjir nei dêr.
I was so scared, I was real.	Ik wie sa bang, ik wie echt.
You'll have to ask him.	Jo sille him freegje moatte.
He's hard to deal with.	Hy is dreech om te gean mei.
I think more than anyone in the house.	Ik tink mear as immen yn 'e hûs.
But, we still have a way to go.	Mar, wy hawwe noch in wei te gean.
I think it can be seen there now.	Ik tink dat it dêr no te sjen is.
He was ready for something else.	Hy wie klear foar wat oars.
The family goes on with their lives.	De famylje giet troch mei har libben.
Either you are going to get help or.	Of jo geane help krije of.
Someone can take it.	Immen kin it nimme.
Try often to be yourself.	Besykje faak om jo te wêzen.
It needs to get off.	It moat ôf.
There is no better time than now.	Der is gjin bettere tiid as no.
He doesn't need you anymore.	Hy hat dy net mear nedich.
We know what we're talking about, let us help you !.	Wy witte wêr't wy it oer hawwe, lit ús jo helpe!.
A few years.	In pear jier.
The woman did not belong in this place.	De frou hearde net op dit plak.
I think we would not come up with that yet.	Ik tink dat wy dêr noch net mei komme soene.
And the next, and the next.	En de folgjende, en de folgjende.
Everyone is talking about it.	Elkenien hat it der oer.
As if you had been eating for hours.	As hiest oeren oan iten west.
We have a word for this.	Wy hawwe hjir in wurd foar.
I'm still getting over it.	Ik kom der noch oer.
I have nothing to do with it now.	Ik ha der no neat oan.
There he wants to return.	Dêr wol er werom.
I was three.	Ik wie trije.
Work well.	Wurkje goed.
I love the water.	Ik hâld fan it wetter.
It was clear enough why.	It wie dúdlik genôch wêrom.
We need to do things right.	Wy moatte dingen goed dwaan.
This book is a hard read.	Dit boek is in hurd lêzen.
Now you have to eat.	No moatte jo ite.
So it was now.	Sa wie it no.
That would not be easy.	Dat soe net maklik wurde.
Things are different here now.	Dingen binne hjir no oars.
To do work.	Wurk te dwaan.
Well, said father.	No, sei heit.
If no one sees, you're bad.	As gjinien sjocht, binne jo min.
I know we're friends.	Ik wit dat wy freonen binne.
That has happened before.	Dat is earder bard.
He will not tell me.	Hy sil it my net fertelle.
We can go better.	Wy kinne better gean.
She was sure of it.	Se wie der wis fan.
That's not a problem.	Dat is gjin probleem.
I know that a child will become a child.	Ik wit dat in bern in bern sil wurde.
I hope.	ik hope.
Do not pay for it yourself.	Net betelje foar it sels.
And we both knew why.	En wy wisten beide wêrom.
We had a three day weekend ahead of us.	Wy hiene in trije dagen wykein foar ús.
There all morning.	Dêr de hiele moarn.
We were great friends and did everything together.	Wy wiene grutte freonen en diene alles tegearre.
We've seen him become a man.	Wy ha sjoen him wurden in man.
And my best friend still does not talk to me.	En myn bêste freon praat noch altyd net mei my.
Maybe she actually wants to see me again.	Miskien wol se my eins wol wer sjen.
They did not need much more.	Se hiene net folle mear nedich.
You make the best of it.	Jo meitsje der it bêste fan.
And if they can not, not really my problem.	En as se net kinne, net echt myn probleem.
Whether you get him or not.	Of jo krije him of net.
And he's so angry.	En hy sa lilk.
I would like to talk to you about your wife.	Ik soe graach mei dy prate wolle oer dyn frou.
And so he was.	En sa wie hy.
It goes on and on.	It giet troch en troch.
Just for now.	Krekt foar no.
It could be from anything or everyone.	It koe fan alles of elkenien wêze.
I thought he was gone a long time ago.	Ik tocht dat er al lang lyn fuort wie.
This bothers me a lot.	Dit docht my tige oan.
It actually works.	It eins wurket.
You are needed.	Jo binne nedich.
Not for me, this was my house.	Net foar my, dit wie myn hûs.
That's what I told her.	Dat sei ik har.
No one knows for sure where the father is.	Net ien wit wis wêr't de heit is.
Just like we did.	Krekt as wy diene.
Ask for him, he will come.	Freegje om him, hy sil komme.
I do not need you.	Ik haw dy net nedich.
Let us help you.	Lit ús jo helpe.
It was evening.	It wie jûn.
How long were they gone.	Hoe lang wiene se fuort.
Well, if that's what you want to say, fine.	No, as dat is wat jo sizze wolle, goed.
And then school.	En dan skoalle.
I know he had never thought much about children before.	Ik wit dat er noch nea folle oer bern tocht hie.
Someone looked at him.	Immen seach him oan.
The photo, please.	De foto, asjebleaft.
Everyone loves children.	Elkenien hâldt fan bern.
Just someone who makes them money.	Krekt ien dy't makket se jild.
It was much, much more.	It wie folle, folle mear.
More than once, even.	Mear as ien kear, sels.
We are here, and they need us.	Wy binne hjir, en se hawwe ús nedich.
There is no way.	Der is gjin wei.
And it's more than that.	En it is mear as dat.
Without the past.	Sûnder it ferline.
I know people who need this.	Ik ken minsken dy't dit nedich hawwe.
Or a mother.	Of in mem.
They were on display.	Se wiene te sjen.
Even though much more needs to be done, it has begun.	Ek al moat der noch folle mear dien wurde, it is begûn.
Take me then.	Nim my dan.
Another year.	Noch in jier.
Of course, the police came and took him with them.	Fansels kaam de plysje en naam him mei.
I found it easy to get away.	Ik fûn it maklik om fuort te gean.
With that, see you all.	Mei dat, oant sjen elkenien.
We want what is best for him.	Wy wolle wat it bêste foar him is.
There would be no more of that either.	Dêr soene der ek net mear fan wêze.
Let's get the other.	Litte wy de oare krije.
We can do nothing but wait.	Wy kinne neat dwaan as wachtsje.
If they need help, they will say so there.	As se help nedich hawwe, sille se dat dêr wol sizze.
We will need this.	Wy sille dit nedich hawwe.
They all ask me back.	Se freegje my allegear werom.
Not even one.	Net iens ien.
Be good at it.	Wês der goed mei.
It gave me hope.	It joech my hope.
You have it at home and play it at work.	Jo hawwe it thús en spylje it op it wurk.
I would be for it.	Ik soe der foar wêze.
This should be enough to get us through the week.	Dit soe genôch wêze moatte om ús troch de wike te kommen.
Which is a lot.	Wat in protte is.
Not as fun as you might think.	Net sa leuk as jo miskien tinke.
He accepted the job.	Hy naam it wurk oan.
There was still a problem.	Der wie noch in probleem.
She had never seen him again after that day.	Se hie him nei dy dei nea wer sjoen.
But that someone would not be me.	Mar dy immen soe my net wêze.
But that's good too.	Mar dat is ek goed.
Just knowing this is not enough.	Gewoan witte dit is net genôch.
She did not want to know.	Se woe it net witte.
And, clearly, he knew me.	En, dúdlik, hy koe my.
I'm ready now.	Ik bin no klear.
I have no idea how well this works.	Ik haw gjin idee hoe goed dit wurket.
The words would not come.	De wurden soene net komme.
He was very angry.	Hy wie tige lilk.
It has happened often, but so often it is not there.	It is faak bard, mar sa faak is it der net.
We can agree on that.	Dêr kinne wy ​​it oer iens wurde.
I think of the man, and how he died.	Ik tink oan de man, en hoe't er stoar.
The work is not easy.	It wurk is net maklik.
Mine is not.	Myn is net.
And your family.	En dyn famylje.
He could not go home.	Hy koe net nei hûs.
Her last thoughts were of her family	Har lêste gedachten wiene fan har famylje
You're against me.	Do bist tsjin my.
Not saying they will be very good though.	Net sizze se sille wêze hiel goed al.
And the woman did not like him.	En de frou like him net leuk.
You can probably stop reading.	Jo kinne wierskynlik ophâlde mei lêzen.
Go and try it.	Gean en besykje it.
We'll ask for it.	Wy sille it freegje.
I think we're having problems.	Ik tink dat wy problemen hawwe.
Her mother could not help her either.	Har mem koe har ek net helpe.
That's what happened today.	Dat is hjoed wat bard.
She liked him.	Se mocht him graach.
Now three months.	No trije moanne.
She took it.	Se naam it.
You are not leaving here.	Jo geane hjir net fuort fan.
She had told him the truth.	Se hie him de wierheid ferteld.
There's a job.	Der is in baan.
My husband .	Myn man .
So they talk about it.	Sa prate se der oer.
This never happens.	Dit bart noait.
Everyone was totally into it.	Elkenien wie der hielendal yn.
Or eat him.	Of yt him.
We ask, they do.	Wy freegje, se dogge.
People, it had to be said.	Minsken, it moast sein wurde.
None of us could help seeing now.	Net ien fan ús koe helpe no te sjen.
I feel a little sick.	Ik fiel my wat siik.
We can see something good.	Wy kinne wat goed sjen.
And it was not nice.	En it wie net moai.
I've never seen this before.	Ik haw dit noch noait earder sjoen.
But now he is gone too.	Mar no is hy ek fuort.
What is it good of you to be here.	Wat is it goed fan jo om hjir te wêzen.
But by us they are hard to find today.	Mar troch ús binne se hjoed min te finen.
If you want to do something right, you have to do it yourself.	As jo ​​​​wat goed dien wolle, moatte jo it sels dwaan.
I need to talk to you.	Ik moat mei dy prate.
She wanted a house.	Se woe in hûs.
But they are fun to watch.	Mar se binne leuk om te sjen.
What is this? 	Wat is dit?
It had been a week since something had started.	It wie al in wike as wat net begûn.
That does not mean that these people are wrong.	Dat wol net sizze dat dizze minsken ferkeard binne.
I know you better than that.	Ik ken dy better as dat.
I'm sure you can.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo it kinne.
I read the whole thing.	Ik haw it hiele ding lêzen.
He did not need it.	Hy hie it net nedich.
We need to buy more food.	Wy moatte mear iten keapje.
You probably will.	Jo sille wierskynlik wêze.
But about this.	Mar oer dit.
There is not too little time in the day.	Der is net te min tiid yn 'e dei.
It's gone.	It is fuort.
You were really good.	Jo wiene echt goed.
The door opened again.	De doar gie wer iepen.
There are many, many other problems with the idea.	D'r binne in protte, in protte oare problemen mei it idee.
Last night it had been different.	Fannacht hie it oars west.
I would not let it happen.	Ik soe it net barre litte.
as for one.	as foar ien.
He felt good.	Hy fielde him goed.
Thought it.	Tocht it.
I love you more than life.	Ik hâld fan dy mear as it libben.
Not everyone has those things either.	Net elkenien hat dy dingen ek.
I think we need more of that.	Ik tink dat wy dêr mear fan nedich binne.
Over the last three years.	Oer de lêste trije jier.
Had to ask you something.	Moast dy wat freegje.
Help me figure out where the problem is.	Help my út te finen wêr't it probleem is.
He would never.	Hy soe nea.
We did family things.	Wy diene famylje dingen.
Something else happened here.	Hjir barde wat oars.
And there he was.	En dêr wie er.
If it works, fine.	As it wurket, goed.
It's exactly what it is.	It is krekt wat it is.
I do not know how he found me.	Ik wit net hoe't er my fûn.
Is that it was nothing of the sort.	Is dat it wie neat fan it soarte.
Please.	Graach graach.
One day we will pay for this.	Op in dei sille wy dit betelje.
But you have to see it for yourself.	Mar jo moatte it sels sjen.
Just easy to have.	Gewoan maklik om te hawwen.
No time for that now.	Dêr no gjin tiid foar.
Maybe a week too late.	Miskien in wike te let.
This is not true.	Dit is net wier.
That would do it for me.	Dat soe it foar my dwaan.
Well, that's easy.	No, dat is maklik.
A long time ago.	Lang lyn.
But it was difficult.	Mar it wie dreech.
One on one.	Ien op ien.
He was not too happy.	Hy wie net al te bliid.
Her father again.	Har heit wer.
If you get the chance, go and see him.	As jo ​​​​de kâns krije, gean dan en sjoch him.
I still remember it hit me like that.	Ik wit noch dat it my sa rekke.
May not even know.	Mei net iens witte.
We do not know enough.	Wy witte net genôch.
There was nothing.	Dêr wie neat.
No idea.	Gjin idee.
I go to work every day.	Ik gean alle dagen oan it wurk.
Everyone grows old.	Elkenien wurdt âld.
There was really nothing else she could do.	D'r wie eins neat oars dat se dwaan koe.
They were so bad.	Se wiene sa min.
That is not happening now.	Dat bart no net.
It just knows.	It wit gewoan.
But there was no time to talk about it here.	Mar der wie gjin tiid om hjir oer te praten.
It happens.	It komt foar.
We'll still have an hour or so before we have to go back.	Wy sille noch in oere of wat hawwe foardat wy werom moatte.
It may be late.	It kin wêze let.
I could not ask him anything.	Ik koe him neat freegje.
Of course, she seemed to be alone.	Fansels like se allinnich te wêzen.
No way would he stop now.	Gjin manier soe er no ophâlde.
Make sure you arrive early to get a good seat.	Wês wis dat jo betiid komme om in goede sit te krijen.
Is she ready for this?	Is se hjir klear foar.
You said it happened a long time ago.	Jo seine dat it lang lyn bard is.
I'm in the right place.	Ik bin op it goede plak.
He did not see me.	Hy seach my net.
I know something about it, but not enough.	Ik wit der wat fan, mar net genôch.
But he is.	Mar hy is.
I also.	ik ek.
You are my friend.	Do bist myn freon.
We can not do it without your help.	Wy kinne it net dwaan sûnder jo help.
That is not so easy to find.	Dat is net sa maklik te finen.
I see no reason why you can not.	Ik sjoch gjin reden wêrom't jo dat net kinne.
He does not see us trying to get out.	Hy sjocht ús net besykje út te kommen.
I've done well so far.	Ik haw it oant no ta goed dien.
I can not find one.	Ik kin gjin ien fine.
That does not pay you.	Dat betelje jo net.
But that was not the case anymore.	Mar sa wie it net mear.
When his time came.	Doe't syn tiid kaam.
What was he wearing when he walked into the house?	Wat hie er oan doe't er yn 'e hûs rûn?
It ran like a man.	It rûn as in man.
He can not play then.	Hy kin dan net spylje.
Go back to the party.	Gean werom nei it feest.
Sit there in the water.	Sit dêr yn it wetter.
We can give you the best time of your life.	Wy kinne jo de bêste tiid fan jo libben jaan.
We will leave him out of the question.	Wy sille him út 'e fraach litte.
People talk about them.	Minsken prate oer har.
I was not really for him.	Ik wie net echt foar him.
And you did it right.	En jo hawwe it goed dien.
Of course not one on one.	Fansels net ien op ien.
He could not let it go now, he said to himself.	Hy koe it him no net litte, sei er tsjin himsels.
It works on everything.	It wurket op alles.
We need more.	Wy moatte mear.
Not anymore.	Net mear.
It does not matter who says it.	It makket net út wa't it seit.
Things different than the kids.	Dingen oars as de bern.
She may be one of the best ever made.	Se kin wêze ien fan de bêste ea makke.
One man has a problem, one does not.	Ien man hat in probleem, ien net.
I was found.	Ik waard fûn.
And there's no reason it should be here.	En d'r is gjin reden dat it hjir moat.
Could be her last hope.	Koe har lêste hope wêze.
That makes it even better.	Dat makket it noch better.
Everything in question again.	Alles wer yn fraach.
And that was that.	En dat wie dat.
Then we get into big trouble.	Dan komme wy yn grutte problemen.
I do not know what you're talking about!	Ik wit net wêr't jo it oer hawwe!
She has never done much work.	Se hat noait folle wurk dien.
Has never looked anything like that.	Dêr hat noait wat út sjoen.
I'm coming tonight.	Ik kom fannacht.
There has been no word.	Der is gjin wurd west.
People eat a lot and take their time.	Minsken ite in protte en nimme har tiid.
He did not see his hair.	Hy seach syn hier net.
But it's only for two days.	Mar it is mar foar twa dagen.
I do not need anyone.	Ik haw gjinien nedich.
It then works for me.	It wurket dan foar my.
But one day it started.	Mar op in dei begûn it.
If people do what they love, you can tell.	As minsken dogge wat se hâlde, kinne jo fertelle.
They have life.	Se hawwe it libben.
Think about it.	Tink der oer nei.
I'm sure there will be.	Ik bin der wis fan dat der sil wêze.
I hit it really hard.	Ik rekke der echt hiel hurd mei.
She's not coming.	Se komt net.
The car was gone.	De auto wie fuort.
We were no different.	Wy wiene net oars.
Could this be the problem.	Koe dit it probleem wêze.
I got it right here.	Ik haw it krekt hjir.
Do not take them back.	Nim se net werom.
It's too long ago.	It is te lang lyn.
It was nice to get away from it all.	It wie moai om fan alles ôf te kommen.
It was time for his first class.	It wie tiid foar syn earste klasse.
I would like to be that guy one day.	Ik soe dy keardel wol ien dei wêze wolle.
He's not leaving.	Hy giet net fuort.
I did not know that at all.	Dat wist ik allegear net.
You have children.	Do hast bern.
Tell people about what's going on.	Fertel minsken oer wat der bart.
She was not ready to help him.	Se wie net ree om him te helpen.
Please look at me.	Sjoch asjebleaft nei my.
To both of us.	Oan ús beide.
She handed him the letter.	Se joech him de brief.
Which is just fine.	Wat is gewoan goed.
Here, no one knew me.	Hjir, gjinien koe my.
How much is hard to say.	Hoefolle is dreech te sizzen.
I could tell he was not interested.	Ik koe sizze dat hy net ynteressearre wie.
I can not say whether it is good or bad.	Ik kin net sizze oft it goed of min is.
That must be it.	Dat moat it wêze.
It became clear that she had no idea what had happened.	It waard dúdlik dat se gjin idee hie wat der bard wie.
I just really want to know where he came from.	Ik wol gewoan echt witte wêr't hy wei kaam.
No problem.	Gjin probleem.
Whatever happens.	Wat der ek bart.
And to give us a chance to have more time together.	En om ús in kâns te jaan om mear tiid tegearre te hawwen.
You have to tell me what's going on here.	Jo moatte my fertelle wat hjir bart.
I had just started.	Ik wie krekt begûn.
Maybe she should.	Miskien moat se.
I just look at her.	Ik sjoch har mar oan.
I did not even know you were here.	Ik wist net iens dat jo hjir wiene.
It has been very difficult to be here.	It hat hiel dreech west hjir te wêzen.
We have had enough of that.	Dêr hawwe wy genôch fan.
I bought this, this, and this.	Ik kocht dizze, dizze, en dizze.
It's just enough.	It is krekt genôch.
It does not hurt.	It docht gjin sear.
Then you have come to the right place.	Dan binne jo op it goede plak kommen.
This was beautiful.	Dit wie moai.
We will leave these problems to another time.	Wy litte dizze problemen nei in oare tiid.
This year they are again.	Dit jier binne se wer.
No one else has ever done that for you.	Nimmen oars hat dat ea foar dy dien.
Of course we did.	Dat diene wy ​​fansels.
You need to make a plan.	Jo moatte in plan meitsje.
They had not said anything to me about it.	Se hiene der neat fan tsjin my sein.
Do you have to go?	Moatte jo gean?
It did not seem too much.	It like net al te folle.
If he had.	As hy hie.
You just do not need it anymore.	Jo hawwe it gewoan net mear nedich.
Or not to say.	Of net te sizzen.
I'm going too hard.	Ik gean te hurd.
He never goes back.	Hy giet noait werom.
I wanted my family back.	Ik woe myn famylje werom.
And he would.	En hy soe.
In fact, the man was just sitting in a car.	Eins siet de man krekt yn in auto.
But do not tell him that.	Mar fertel him dat net.
It seems like it affected a lot of people.	It like wol oft it in protte minsken rekke.
Not everyone can do it.	Net elkenien kin it dwaan.
We need to do something.	Wy moatte wat dwaan.
Mom didn't have to worry so much about it.	Mem hoegde der net safolle soargen oer te meitsjen.
He had expected it all.	Hy hie dat alles ferwachte.
Dad all the time.	Heit de hiele tiid.
It's almost time for bed.	It is hast tiid foar bêd.
We are scared, of course.	Wy binne bang, fansels.
This time, there seemed to be no question.	Dizze kear like der gjin fraach te wêzen.
But now was not the time to go back.	Mar no wie net de tiid om werom te gean.
That will always be true.	Dat sil altyd wier wêze.
I see them.	Ik sjoch se.
I can not seem to figure out why it does not work.	Ik kin net lykje út te finen wêrom't it net wurket.
And you did the only thing you knew how to do.	En jo diene it iennichste wat jo wisten te dwaan.
He said well.	Hy sei goed.
He was still alone.	Hy wie noch allinnich.
We need to look around us, see what we can see.	Wy moatte om ús hinne sjen, sjen wat wy sjen kinne.
The woman died tomorrow.	De frou stoar by moarn.
But he knows nothing of that.	Mar dêr wit er neat fan.
But he could not stay in the house.	Mar hy koe net yn 'e hûs bliuwe.
She had a meeting, she said.	Se hie in gearkomste, sei se.
I would love to do that.	Dat mocht ik graach dwaan.
He did not seem angry, he seemed worried.	Hy like net lilk, hy like soargen.
Everything else is still here.	Al it oare is hjir noch.
All she could do.	Alles wat se dwaan koe.
Maybe there was something, but she did not see it.	Miskien wie der wat, mar se seach it net.
None as words.	Gjin as wurden.
That set me back a bit.	Dat sette my in bytsje werom.
But pretty much everyone looks different.	Mar moai elkenien sjocht der oars út.
He could not tell.	Hy koe it net fertelle.
If you have a problem, just ask!	As jo ​​​​in probleem hawwe, freegje jo gewoan!
I'm nothing.	Ik bin neat.
That all works well.	Dat wurket allegear goed.
My father was a teacher.	Myn heit wie learaar.
And if she had.	En as se hie.
You think you can do anything !.	Jo tinke dat jo alles kinne dwaan!.
Then wait two days.	Wachtsje dan twa dagen.
First to prison.	Earst nei finzenis.
We take what is given to us, it says.	Wy nimme wat ús jûn wurdt, seit it.
Please help if you have seen it.	Help asjebleaft as jo it sjoen hawwe.
It is a family favorite.	It is in famylje favorite.
No problems, just a few questions.	Gjin problemen, mar in pear fragen.
But even if people get a job, they are not doing well.	Mar sels as minsken in baan krije, hawwe se it net goed.
I'm going there myself.	Ik gean der sels hinne.
Probably better than anyone.	Wierskynlik better as elkenien.
We are glad you are here !.	Wy binne bliid dat jo hjir binne!.
I really did not know what to think.	Ik wist echt net wat ik tinke moast.
Either way, you go.	Hoe dan ek, jo geane.
You can not tell it to anyone.	Jo kinne it net oan ien fertelle.
You will know it soon enough.	Jo sille it gau genôch witte.
It's ready.	It is klear.
There is the reason.	Dêr is de reden.
I want everyone to have something for tomorrow.	Ik wol dat elkenien wat hat foar moarn.
For you maybe not.	Foar jo miskien net.
He never knew.	Hy wist it noait.
You will not make it.	Jo sille it net meitsje.
And that's pretty much everything.	En dat is sa'n bytsje alles.
He has not yet told police.	Hy hat de plysje noch neat sein.
You should too.	Jo moatte ek.
Tomorrow it can not go well.	Moarn kin it net goed gean.
It was the first time they met.	It wie de earste kear dat se moete.
Not that he needs it.	Net dat er it nedich hat.
I can not believe he's gone.	Ik kin net leauwe dat er fuort is.
For me to do that must be bad.	Foar my om dat te dwaan moat it min wêze.
He hoped it did not.	Hy hope dat it net hie.
Evening in bed.	Jûn op bêd.
She will not look away from him.	Se sil net fan him ôf sjen.
But the money would be nice.	Mar it jild soe moai wêze.
But he was not my husband.	Mar hy wie myn man net.
Never my favorite thing.	Nea myn favorite ding.
It could even have been earlier.	It koe sels earder west hawwe.
It did not seem to him.	It like him net.
She could not work.	Se koe net wurkje.
I'm not sure how to show this though.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe te sjen litte dit al.
I had said it.	Ik hie it sein.
Don't leave me.	Gean net by my wei.
Do not worry, this is my house.	Sit gjin soargen, dit is myn hûs.
Well, he's better where he is.	No, hy is better wêr't hy is.
They had never talked about money before.	Se hiene it noch nea oer jild hân.
I waited but he never came back.	Ik wachte mar hy kaam noait werom.
He does not like children.	Hy hâldt net fan bern.
When I think back, that must have been it.	As ik werom tink, dat moat it west hawwe.
She never looked at him.	Se seach him noait oan.
I thought this was true.	Ik tocht dat dit wier wie.
I want to believe it is.	Ik wol leauwe dat it is.
You've been nice to me.	Do bist aardich tsjin my west.
I could not let him go.	Ik koe him net litte litte.
She was home.	Se wie thús.
No one will come.	Gjinien sil komme.
It was beautiful and it scared them both.	It wie moai en it makke har beide bang.
It can not be otherwise.	It kin net oars.
She's happy, she said.	Se is bliid, sei se.
This is my favorite time of day.	Dit is myn favorite tiid fan de dei.
So much more.	Sa folle mear.
We do not think it is a good idea.	Wy tinke net dat it in goed idee is.
I noticed too late.	Ik kaam te let op.
You know, we can do it.	Jo witte, wy kinne it dwaan.
They'll get you out of the way.	Se geane jo út 'e wei.
Better is better.	Better is better.
Maybe some water would help.	Miskien wat wetter soe helpe.
I really do not know why.	Ik wit echt net wêrom.
You just did it.	Do hast it krekt dien.
I never said you should stay in bed.	Ik haw noait sein dat jo op bêd bliuwe moatte.
Nobody knew that.	Nimmen wist dat.
She pretended not to hear him.	Se die oft se him net hearde.
This one had been around for a long time.	Dizze hie al lang west.
Someone like.	Immen like.
We need to do two things now.	Wy moatte no twa dingen dwaan.
Both are tired.	Beide binne wurch.
We take care of each other.	Wy soargje foar elkoar.
At that time.	Yn dy tiid.
That is good and clear.	Dat is goed en dúdlik.
It's his car.	It is syn auto.
It really came to me.	It kaam echt ta my.
It does not hurt so much anymore.	It docht net sa sear mear.
All this is true, and it does not matter.	Dit alles is wier, en der makket neat fan.
Food was what she needed first.	Iten wie wat se earst nedich hie.
It's just in time, of course.	It is krekt op 'e tiid, fansels.
Here it is.	Hjir is it.
But they were not always so.	Mar se wiene net altyd sa.
Of course it is.	Fansels is it.
She's just about ready.	Se is krekt oer klear.
She was still so scared.	Se wie noch sa bang.
They just want a better life.	Se wolle gewoan in better libben.
You were wrong about me.	Jo wiene ferkeard oer my.
He's a nice man, well.	Hy is in moai man, goed.
I will not say it here.	Ik sil it hjir net sizze.
In fact, much more can be said.	Eins kin folle mear sein wurde.
He had no idea how long.	Hy hie gjin idee hoe lang.
We talked and that was it.	Wy prate en dat wie it oer.
There would be nothing to find out.	Der soe neat út te finen wêze.
There was no food in the house.	Der wie gjin iten yn 'e hûs.
You're a kid.	Do bist in bern.
It had been a child.	It hie in bern west.
You can not just wish it away.	Jo kinne it net gewoan fuort winskje.
It happens though.	It bart wol.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Elkenien wist dat hy der wêze soe.
I need to make some time to talk to you.	Ik moat wat tiid meitsje om mei dy te praten.
His wife was angry.	Syn frou wie lilk.
It's nice, actually.	It is aardich, eins.
They did so quickly.	Dat diene se gau.
I just did not know what to do.	Ik wist gewoan net wat ik dwaan moast.
Or can be.	Of kin wêze.
Back with her husband.	Werom mei har man.
They do not want that either.	Dat wolle se ek net.
But money just goes through and through.	Mar jild giet gewoan troch en troch.
Feel free to join.	Fiel jo frij om mei te dwaan.
How bad.	Wat min.
The food was better there.	It iten wie dêr better.
He knew her well.	Hy koe har goed.
We will have them in a few days.	Wy sille se oer in pear dagen hawwe.
They do not want to take any more chances.	Se wolle der gjin kâns mear op nimme.
There was also the food.	Dêr wie ek it iten.
We got a job.	Wy hawwe ús in baan krigen.
I wanted to get out of there.	Ik woe der fan ôf.
As if it did not work out one way or another.	As gie it net op ien of oare manier.
Now about food.	No oer iten.
But as.	Mar as.
We just eat twice as much.	Wy ite gewoan twa kear safolle.
We have nothing against him.	Wy hawwe neat tsjin him.
Let us see here too.	Lit ús hjir ek sjen.
You in the car.	Jo yn 'e auto.
I have been coming here for the last three years.	Ik kaam hjir de lêste trije jier ta.
Better late than never!	Better let as nea!
I made it look like that.	Ik liet it sa lykje.
We will work with you.	Wy sille mei jo wurkje.
Whether right or wrong, one thing is for sure.	Oft goed of ferkeard, ien ding is wis.
Keep it up.	Hâld it mar.
You can not tell what they think.	Jo kinne net fertelle wat se tinke.
But no one could make it better either.	Mar nimmen koe it ek better meitsje.
It's not enough.	It is net genôch.
We are not what they are after.	Wy binne net wat se nei binne.
For people.	Foar minsken.
You should try if it works here.	Jo moatte besykje as it hjir wurket.
I took him at his word.	Ik naam him op syn wurd.
I had never done that at home.	Dat hie ik thús noait dien.
She felt much better.	Se fielde har folle better.
I plan to get myself a whole lot really soon.	Ik plan om my in hiele protte echt gau te krijen.
Well, it was nice to see you.	No, it wie moai dy te sjen.
I'm here tomorrow.	Ik bin hjir moarn.
I thought you might like to try.	Ik tocht dat jo miskien graach besykje.
I did the same.	Ik die itselde.
People can not even see what they are.	Minsken kinne net iens sjen wat se binne.
She was my best friend at the time.	Se wie myn bêste freon op 'e tiid.
I'll just tell him.	Ik sil it him mar fertelle.
They are afraid of them and should be.	Se binne bang foar har en moatte wêze.
Can be anyone.	Kin elkenien wêze.
For a few hours it would be fine.	Foar in pear oeren soe it goed wêze.
I should probably just go there.	Ik soe der miskien mar hinne moatte.
We will regret leaving him.	Wy sille it spyt hawwe om fan him ôf te gean.
That's what we want.	Dat wolle wy graach ha.
That photo needs to go away.	Dy foto moat fuort.
Not at all.	Dat hielendal net.
We show that this is not possible.	Wy litte sjen dat dit net kin.
He's coming back.	Hy komt wer werom.
Whatever you want.	Wat jo wolle.
They stay really nice and it's easy to do.	Se bliuwe echt moai en it is maklik te dwaan.
Everything's fine.	Alles komt goed.
Very few people have heard of him.	Hiel pear minsken hawwe heard fan him.
Know the truth and it will set you free.	Ken de wierheid en it sil jo frij meitsje.
He is whole and true.	Hy is hiel en wier.
I have a picture of him.	Ik haw in foto fan him.
Drok.	Drok.
There is reason for hope.	Der is reden foar hope.
You must be mistaken.	Jo moatte miskien wêze.
Maybe he should go.	Miskien moat er gean.
Now you know where you are.	No witte jo wêr't jo binne.
Can you tell us about the past?	Kinne jo ús fertelle oer it ferline?
Let him do his work.	Lit him syn wurk dwaan.
For some reason, they like to talk to me.	Om ien of oare reden prate se graach mei my.
We have no children.	Wy hawwe gjin bern.
But we could not find it yet.	Mar wy koene it noch net fine.
If anyone could help me.	As immen my helpe koe.
He makes me so happy.	Hy makket my sa bliid.
It is not enough to take a picture.	It is net genôch om in foto te nimmen.
I really liked it.   	Ik fûn it tige leuk.   
mother.	mem.
He showed them to his car.	Hy liet se oan syn auto sjen.
I would be too.	Ik soe ek wêze.
There was only the past.	Der wie allinnich it ferline.
Cycling to work is not for everyone.	Fyts nei it wurk is net foar elkenien.
And not too often.	En net te faak.
Not saying we are bad though.	Net sizze wy binne min al.
You have to pay now.	Jo moatte no betelje.
But this must be done in the right way.	Mar dit moat dien wurde op de goede manier.
I know they do not live there anymore.	Ik wit dat se dêr net mear wenje.
You're made for it.	Do bist der foar makke.
For one, it was his father's house.	Foar ien wie it it hûs fan syn heit.
It's time to do something, she thought.	It wurdt tiid om wat te dwaan, tocht se.
A year ago we may not have found him.	In jier lyn hawwe wy him miskien net fûn.
After the weekend.	Nei it wykein.
I try to make things right.	Ik besykje dingen goed te meitsjen.
This is still going on today.	Giet dat hjoed noch troch.
I don't know.	Ik wit it net.
It did not matter that she was his mother.	It makke net út dat se syn mem wie.
I hope it works for you !.	Ik hoopje dat it foar jo wurket!.
But there is never anything else.	Mar der is noait wat oars.
I became very ill.	Ik waard tige siik.
And if you do not.	En as jo dat net dogge.
My friend walked away.	Myn freon rûn fuort.
I'm not sure when, but be prepared.	Ik bin net wis wannear, mar wês klear.
They have one car.	Se hawwe ien auto.
And he should be fine.	En hy soe goed wêze moatte.
What went wrong?	Wat gie der ferkeard?
I knew you were doing one.	Ik wist dat jo ien dogge.
They have the kids.	Se hawwe de bern.
Everything will be fine.	Alles sil goed komme.
He would not ask again.	Hy soe net wer freegje.
There can be no such thing.	Der kin net sa'n ding.
The food kept him alive.	It iten him libben.
I do not want to live in this city.	Ik wol net yn dizze stêd wenje.
In fact, everything is.	Eins is alles.
We are like that.	Wy binne sa.
Or to both.	Of oan beide.
So we got who we got.	Sa krigen wy wa't wy krigen.
The house felt different.	It hûs fielde oars.
You want to tell me who said what and when.	Jo wolle my graach fertelle wa't wat sei en wannear.
They're just kids.	It binne mar bern.
Both of him.	Beide fan him.
But it happens.	Mar it bart.
If they knew she was in trouble.	As se wisten dat se yn de problemen siet.
You better not be late for school.	Jo soene better net te let komme op skoalle.
But I will try.	Mar ik besykje wol.
But life shows us that it is not so.	Mar it libben lit ús sjen dat it net sa is.
Not easy to serve.	Net maklik dien.
Probably it was.	Wierskynlik wie it.
You go with him.	Jo geane mei him.
I'm right here.	Ik bin hjir krekt.
This was not real.	Dit wie net echt.
That was how she said it.	Dat wie hoe't se it sei.
Things are busy.	Dingen binne drok.
It's pretty bad.	It is frij min.
You need to get a job.	Jo moatte in baan krije.
Really, we know.	Echt, wy witte.
This is what we do and we do it well.	Dit is wat wy dogge en wy dogge it goed.
She could see that he loved her more than anything.	Se koe sjen dat er mear fan har hâlde as wat dan ek.
Buying a home.	In hûs keapje.
Nothing yet, but it's still early.	Noch neat, mar it is noch betiid.
I'm coming up.	Ik kom op.
I have to go back.	Ik moat werom.
It will not work.	It sil net wurkje.
Do not like them.	Net fan har hâlde.
He is not seen or heard from again.	Hy wurdt net wer sjoen of heard.
He's so good.	Sa goed is er.
No word from anyone to anyone.	Gjin wurd fan immen oan immen.
Me and me and me and me.	Ik en my en ik en my.
Well, here he was again.	No, hjir wie er wer.
We are not talking about it anymore.	Wy prate der no net mear oer.
It was good for a bit for my life.	It wie goed foar in bytsje foar myn libben.
I could not find one.	Ik koe gjin ien fine.
Everyone would agree.	Alle soe it iens wêze.
But maybe it's something else.	Mar miskien is it wat oars.
It wanted what it wanted.	It woe wat it woe.
He had never done that before.	Dat hie er noch nea dien.
And he was talking about it.	En hy hie it der oer.
They do not have to.	Dat hoege se net.
The thing will happen.	It ding sil barre.
But problems have a way of finding him.	Mar problemen hawwe in manier om him te finen.
I just look around.	Ik sjoch mar om my hinne.
What year is it now?	Hokker jier is it no?
In the food.	Yn it iten.
I myself also have a question.	Ik sels haw ek in fraach.
It was the only way.	It wie de ienige manier.
She was not pretty.	Se wie net moai.
Let us know what you all think.	Lit ús witte wat jo allegear tinke.
I took them to school every day.	Ik naam se alle dagen nei skoalle.
In fact, they come out the same for both.	Eins komme se foar beide itselde út.
Not much thought was given to it.	Der waard net folle oan tocht.
But now, there is nothing.	Mar no, der is neat.
Through your words.	Troch jo wurden.
At this hour she can not eat.	Op dit oere kin se net ite.
Carefully he approached the animal.	Foarsichtich kaam er it bist oan.
If that's what you want.	As dat is wat jo wolle.
They can still do it.	Se kinne noch dwaan.
She has gotten better.	Se is better wurden.
But he pretends to be surprised.	Mar hy docht oft er ferrast is.
Just about the girl.	Krekt oer it famke.
And it came now.	En dit kaam no.
I'll see you tomorrow.	Ik sjoch dy moarn.
I love that word.	Ik hâld fan dat wurd.
Leave this for now.	Lit dit mar foar no.
If they're here.	As se hjir binne.
Not everyone can do what you do.	Net elkenien kin dwaan wat jo dogge.
You can tell me.	Jo kinne it my fertelle.
It's just what you want to put in there.	It is gewoan wat jo der yn sette wolle.
Feel so bad.	Fiel my sa min.
A man she did not want.	In man dy't se net woe.
Her family liked her.	Har famylje mocht har.
Talk to your mom.	Praat mei dyn mem.
Everyone is up to something here.	Elkenien is hjir wat oan.
Or the food.	Of it iten.
My mom did what school just did.	Myn mem die wat skoalle net die.
Do something else.	Doch wat oars.
To need one person.	Om moat ien persoan.
She did everything she could to help.	Se die alles wat se koe om te helpen.
There has to be a better way.	Der moat in bettere manier wêze.
I did not even see it.	Ik seach it net iens.
It's real now.	It is no echt.
I got someone looking at him.	Ik krige ien dy't nei him seach.
But he was much more than that.	Mar hy wie folle mear as dat.
They want to eat your life.	Se wolle jo libben ite.
Give us a better chance.	Jou ús in bettere kâns.
A photo last week.	In foto ferline wike.
He said the car was not there before.	Hy sei dat de auto der net earder wie.
I never knew.	Ik wist it noait.
You heard her.	Do hearde har.
We did not know how and why.	Wy wisten net hoe en wêrom.
That car goes hard.	Dy auto giet hurd.
Do not speak until you speak.	Praat net oant jo prate.
I don't believe you.	Ik leau dy net.
It was just one of many.	It wie mar ien fan in protte.
But they do us no harm.	Mar se dogge ús neat.
No one would say anything.	Nimmen soe wat sizze.
You want both people to like it.	Jo wolle dat beide minsken it like wolle.
He's tall.	Hy is lang.
She had read it in a book.	Se hie it yn in boek lêzen.
If we wait, it's too late.	As wy wachtsje, is it te let.
I will always make you so happy.	Ik sil dy altyd sa bliid meitsje.
Until tonight.	Oant fannacht.
But no one knows exactly how much it is.	Mar gjinien wit krekt hoefolle it is.
Everyone has a past.	Elkenien hat in ferline.
You get a job again.	Jo krije wer wurk.
They had just had their first child.	Se hiene krekt har earste bern krigen.
That please let me know what you think.	Dat lit my asjebleaft witte wat jo tinke.
We will see about that.	Dêr sille wy oer sjen.
There was also no food.	Der wie ek gjin iten.
We just play.	Wy spylje gewoan.
We think about things that are not ready yet.	Wy tinke oer dingen dy't noch net klear binne.
I would even say we were happy.	Ik soe sels sizze dat wy bliid wiene.
Let her talk to me.	Lit har mei my prate.
He did not want to be.	Hy woe net wêze.
I have never seen one like this.	Ik haw noch noait sa ien sjoen.
I looked away.	Ik seach fuort.
Just as much as ever.	Krekt sa folle as altyd.
It soon became her life.	It waard al gau har libben.
So you never know.	Sa witte jo noait.
Many people say it is their favorite.	In protte minsken sizze dat it har favorite is.
I had no one to go with.	Ik hie gjinien om mei te gean.
Nobody talks like that to her.	Nimmen prate sa tsjin har.
I may never return.	Ik mei nea werom.
And so she died too.	En sa stoar se ek.
I'm good at this.	Ik bin goed yn dit.
Did not like it.	Hie it net leuk.
What, we are.	Wat, wy binne.
Other days it was easy.	Oare dagen wie it maklik.
If no one is true, we do nothing.	As gjinien wier binne, dogge wy neat.
He set us up.	Hy sette ús op.
I can not really be with him and get a lot done.	Ik kin net echt by him wêze en in protte dien krije.
They will not help you.	Se sille jo net helpe.
I could not do anything right, by my father.	Ik koe neat goed dwaan, troch myn heit.
We'll see you at dinner.	Wy sille dy oan it iten sjen.
He saw her often when he thought she did not see.	Hy seach har faak as er tocht dat se net seach.
I could live with that.	Ik koe hjir wol oan wenne.
But you are not sure how you can make it happen.	Mar do bist der net wis fan hoe't jo kinne meitsje it barre.
You need to ask how you can do this with him.	Jo moatte freegje hoe't jo dit mei him kinne dwaan.
I want you to find her.	Ik wol dat jo har fine.
We love her.	Wy hâlde fan har.
And that may be it.	En dat kin it wêze.
I'm sorry, there's no reason to read it yourself.	It spyt my, d'r is gjin reden om it sels foar te lêzen.
Let's leave it there.	Litte wy it dêr litte.
It was clear where she was coming from.	It wie dúdlik wêr't se oan kaam.
Things that happened.	Dingen dy't barde.
And there is more.	En der is mear.
Is not scared.	Is net bang.
That's always.	Dat die se altyd.
You always stay the same.	Jo bliuwe altyd itselde.
He also felt old.	Hy fielde him ek âld.
He ran over.	Hy rûn oer.
I never want to see that thing again.	Ik wol dat ding noait wer sjen.
A beautiful thing, he thought.	In moai ding, tocht er.
For the next movie.	Foar de folgjende film.
This is also wrong.	Dit is ek ferkeard.
The problem was, there was so much of it.	It probleem wie, der wie safolle fan.
Not that we do.	Net dat wy dat dogge.
This is beautiful.	Dit is moai.
Not the way to go out believe me.	Net de manier om út te gean leau my.
Careful, but she took it.	Foarsichtich, mar se naam it.
We have to do it ourselves.	Wy moatte it sels dwaan.
And then another.	En dan noch ien.
That was the only reason.	Dat wie de ienige reden.
I would be with my friends.	Ik soe wêze mei myn freonen.
This is the.	Dit is de.
Or a lot of water.	Of in protte wetter.
Not what he was after.	Net wat er nei wie.
It was a thing.	It wie in ding.
Not that he expected anything.	Net dat er wat ferwachte.
I had never been here before.	Ik hie hjir noch nea west.
We want to be happy.	Wy wolle bliid wêze.
He could not either, but he wanted to.	Hy koe ek net, mar hy woe wol.
They do not want to know and do not want you to know either.	Se wolle it net witte en wolle dat jo ek net witte.
It sang in one hour.	It liet yn ien oere.
We just have to find it.	Wy moatte it gewoan fine.
But he will not.	Mar hy sil net.
About many things.	Oer in protte dingen.
I tried everything to get them out, but it did not work.	Ik besocht alles om se út te krijen, mar it wurke net.
Can see nothing but money.	Kin neat sjen as jild.
Never enough is good.	Nea genôch is goed.
I'm not quite sure how we would, but it's there.	Ik bin net hielendal wis hoe't wy soene, mar it is der.
People go away.	Minsken geane fuort.
Clearly they had not read the book.	Dúdlik hiene se it boek net lêzen.
His children knew it.	Syn bern wisten it.
She watched him as he ate.	Se seach him as er iet.
Of course not.	Dit mei fansels net.
We can talk.	Wy kinne prate.
She was as old as her mother.	Se wie like âld as har mem.
I have the time.	Ik haw de tiid.
It was hard to see.	It wie dreech om te sjen.
It was beautiful.	It wie moai.
The work is busy here.	It wurk is drok hjir.
On my own.	Allinnich.
That's what we'll show.	Dat sille wy sjen litte.
None of her children attended the meeting.	Gjin fan har bern kaam yn 'e gearkomste op.
John did not like the new plan.	John mocht it nije plan net.
And she was loved by everyone who met her.	En se wie leuk troch elkenien dy't har moete.
His wife loves life.	Syn frou hâlde fan it libben.
I never heard back.	Ik hearde nea werom.
I have no problem talking about it.	Ik haw gjin probleem te praten oer it.
Had to.	Hie moatten.
Well, they eat a lot.	No, se ite in protte.
They will probably go.	Se sille wierskynlik gean.
One may or may not be given.	Ien kin al of net jûn wurde.
I had nothing to do with it.	Ik hie der neat om.
We will help if we can.	Wy sille helpe as wy kinne.
I'll look into it.	Ik sil der nei sjen.
Another reason why he could not love her.	In oare reden wêrom't er net fan har hâlde koe.
It seems to have worked.	It liket te hawwen wurke.
There are many people who like to help.	D'r binne in protte minsken dy't graach helpe.
It was at my house too.	It wie ek by my thús.
And we know it works.	En wy witte dat it wurket.
You're not your father's child.	Do bist net dyn heit syn bern.
I've never been one to do that.	Ik haw noait ien west om dat te dwaan.
This is him.	Dit is hy.
They were real.	Se wiene echt.
We never talked about money.	Wy hawwe it noait oer jild hân.
He is always talking.	Hy is altyd oan it praten.
My car is not working properly.	Myn auto wurket net goed.
I will never do that again.	Dat sil ik noait wer dwaan.
About the money.	Oer it jild.
It must be kept.	It moat hâlden wurde.
And we would talk.	En wy soene prate.
I can not wait to read much more from you.	Ik kin net wachtsje om folle mear fan jo te lêzen.
Are you afraid of what might happen?	Binne jo bang foar wat der barre kin?
In other words, not very good.	Mei oare wurden, net hiel goed.
I love me.	Ik hâld fan my.
This is not very good, but it is better.	Dit is net hiel goed, mar it is better.
She can not look at him.	Se kin net nei him sjen.
She knew enough not to tell her that.	Se wist genôch om har dat net te fertellen.
I think you're sick.	Ik tink dat jo siik binne.
It soon became clear that we were going to win.	Al gau waard dúdlik dat wy winne soene.
I would say something against them.	Ik soe wat tsjin har sizze.
So good to see you.	Sa goed om dy te sjen.
It's too late tomorrow.	It is moarn te let.
And maybe know how it was.	En miskien witte hoe't it wie.
I think it was at the door of her house.	Ik tink dat it by de doar fan har hûs wie.
You can get it and see how it works.	Jo kinne it krije en sjoch hoe't it wurket.
The first and only.	De earste en ienige.
This was what had happened to him.	Dit wie it foar him kommen.
There's just one of those.	D'r is mar ien fan dy.
It will not be good.	It sil net goed wêze.
It felt good.	It fielde goed.
Have you finished the work yet?	Hawwe jo it wurk al klear?
It does nothing for you.	It docht neat foar dy.
We did it before.	Wy diene it earder.
Not about this.	Net oer dit.
We're talking about this.	Wy hawwe it oer dit.
I never got any money.	Ik krige noait gjin jild.
I'm still trying to get a few things through.	Ik besykje noch in pear dingen troch te kommen.
His wife did not give him any children.	Syn frou hat him gjin bern jûn.
He is two people.	Hy is twa minsken.
Take your hours.	Nim dyn oeren.
I was planning for my life.	Ik wie fan plan foar myn libben.
None of this seemed real.	Gjin fan dizze like echt.
She could hardly believe it.	Se koe it hast net leauwe.
I was ready.	Ik wie klear.
And that says something.	En dat seit wat.
He did not want to be there anymore.	Hy woe der net mear wêze.
I need you, she thought.	Ik ha dy nedich, tocht se der oan.
You told me you did.	Jo fertelde my dat jo dien hawwe.
But there is no way to actually do that.	Mar d'r is gjin manier om dat eins te dwaan.
That's what we need.	Dat is wat wy nedich hawwe.
He was not afraid.	Hy wie net bang.
That has never happened before.	Dat is noch noait earder bard.
Today, not tomorrow.	Hjoed, net moarn.
I did not look too good.	Ik seach der net al te goed út.
She's a woman again.	Se is wer in frou.
He told us over and over again.	Hy fertelde ús oer en wer.
This is easy.	Dizze is maklik.
Talk to each other.	Praat mei elkoar.
So they have.	Sa hawwe se.
He was angry and hurt.	Hy wie lilk en sear.
I think it's good.	Ik tink dat it goed is.
Mom would have worried.	Mem soe soargen hawwe.
There's always something it can do.	D'r is altyd wat dat it dwaan kin.
It will happen again when you are back.	It sil wer as jo binne werom.
What I do not.	Wat ik net.
Said this was enough to make it happen.	Sei dit wie genôch om it barre.
He showed me a picture.	Hy liet my in foto sjen.
She wished it was not so late.	Se woe dat it net sa let wie.
There was no hope for me.	Der wie gjin hope foar my.
Keep it good.	Hâld it goed.
He never recorded it.	Hy naam it noait op.
This is about doing something else.	Dit giet oer it dwaan fan wat oars.
Dad does the same.	Heit docht itselde.
I thought this was where it would be.	Ik tocht dat dit wie wêr't it wêze soe.
We leave early.	Wy geane betiid fuort.
It's about me.	It giet oer my.
And we do not know why.	En wy witte net wêrom.
And that happens.	En dat bart wol.
You would be wrong again.	Jo soene wer ferkeard wêze.
I'm going home.	Ik gean nei hûs.
I want to talk a little bit about why we are here today.	Ik wol in bytsje prate oer wêrom't wy hjir hjoed binne.
I'll talk to a man soon.	Ik sil gau mei in man prate.
I know you've never seen me before.	Ik wit dat jo my noch noait earder sjoen hawwe.
This was just a movie.	Dit wie gewoan in film.
Of course you can.	Fansels kinne jo.
I just want to see if she's okay.	Ik wol gewoan sjen dat se goed is.
She took her hand.	Se naam har hân.
His wife would not be happy.	Syn frou soe net bliid wêze.
It was a bad one.	It wie in minne ien.
Good to go.	Goed om te gean.
They can not see.	Se kinne net sjen.
Take this time to record the faith.	Nim dizze tiid om it leauwe op te nimmen.
You can pay him.	Jo kinne him betelje.
We need to give them back to him.	Wy moatte se werom jaan oan him.
I will ask you one more time.	Ik sil dy noch ien kear freegje.
Which they often did.	Wat se faak diene.
That would do well.	Dat soe goed dwaan.
I look away from him.	Ik sjoch fan him ôf.
I look back.	Ik sjoch werom.
She walked to the lake.	Se rûn nei de mar.
It's hard for me to love him.	It is dreech foar my om fan him te hâlden.
I do not know what is good.	Ik wit net wat goed is.
That's what you need to do.	Dat moatte jo dwaan.
They would like her.	Se soene har graach.
I think it was just time.	Ik tink dat it krekt tiid wie.
This is why you should try and do something fun.	Dit is wêrom jo moatte besykje en dwaan wat leuk.
It's not my doing.	It is net myn dwaan.
They had seen me the same.	Se hiene my itselde sjoen.
He is so good to his children.	Hy is sa goed foar syn bern.
It is not.	It is net.
She was an old woman.	Se wie in âld frou.
They are not many.	Se binne net folle.
It did not bother her.	It die har net oan.
He wanted a child.	Hy woe in bern.
Everything was fine with her.	Alles wie goed mei har.
But he would not do it.	Mar hy soe it net dwaan.
I really do not know what else to say.	Ik wit echt net wat ik oars moat sizze.
We are away from everyone.	Wy binne fuort fan elkenien.
Today it is as if it never happened.	Hjoed is it as is it noait bard.
He knew it, and did not make much of it.	Hy wist it, en makke der net folle fan.
This is a school for very young children.	Dit is in skoalle foar tige jonge bern.
She's coming here.	Se komt hjir.
I just can not stop it.	Ik kin it gewoan net ophâlde.
I did not feel well.	Ik fielde my net goed.
Your best should be good enough.	Jo bêste moat goed genôch wêze.
It's pretty easy to do.	It is frij maklik te dwaan.
But we do not think so.	Mar dat tinke wy net.
City to do that.	Stêd om dat te dwaan.
We need to do something.	Wy moatte wat dwaan.
She could win another one.	Se koe noch ien winne.
Maybe it was my problem.	Miskien wie it myn probleem.
I love my kids and love being a mom.	Ik hâld fan myn bern en hâld fan mem te wêzen.
This car is easy to drive.	Dizze auto is maklik te riden.
For now, it has nothing to do with anything.	Foar no hat it neat mei neat te krijen.
And, last but not least, the headline made you read this article.	En, as lêste, tink oan dit.
He was really scared.	Hy wie echt bang.
That's you from this day on.	Dat binne jo fan dizze dei ôf.
And then it does.	En dan docht it.
Not one of his friends ever saw him again.	Net ien fan syn freonen seach him ea wer.
There is something else too.	Der is ek wat oars.
There was so much he wanted to ask.	Der wie safolle dat er freegje woe.
He's just home.	Hy die net thús.
He wanted the house.	Hy woe it hûs.
It never has.	It hat noait.
And it's actually pretty hard.	En it is eins frij dreech.
Everyone was kind of.	Elkenien soarte fan wie.
Do not get in the way.	Kom net yn 'e wei.
We're doing it again this week.	Wy dogge it dizze wike wer.
The party was open to everyone.	It feest wie iepen foar elkenien.
Somehow it was not the thing done.	Op ien of oare manier wie it net it dien ding.
He knew it was there.	Hy wist wol dat it der wie.
She knew better than to look back.	Se wist better as werom te sjen.
That was a first for me.	Dat wie in earste foar my.
It should not have, but it did.	It hie net moatten, mar it die.
I feel that way.	Ik fiel my sa.
Look at her words.	Sjoch nei har wurden.
We could really go with some more food.	Wy koene echt mei wat mear iten.
I want to win today.	Ik wol hjoed winne.
But only here.	Mar allinnich hjir.
He had heard and seen enough.	Hy hie genôch heard en sjoen.
One is not too good.	Ien is net te goed.
She is no longer with us.	Se is net mear by ús.
He did it often.	Hy die it faak.
He made it himself.	Hy makke it sels.
Not with the time we had.	Net mei de tiid dy't wy hiene.
Never has and it never will.	Nea hat en it sil nea.
Now was the time.	No wie de tiid.
They did not even try to stop him.	Se hawwe net iens besocht him tsjin te hâlden.
More than that need not be said.	Mear dan dat hoecht net sein te wurden.
It can be your best friend.	It kin jo bêste freon wêze.
They really love each other.	Se hâlde echt fan elkoar.
All of these are good.	Al dizze binne goed.
I can show you how to find them.	Ik kin jo sjen litte hoe't jo se fine kinne.
They do not like so much.	Se hâlde net safolle.
I believe you did it for me.	Ik leau dat jo it foar my dien hawwe.
You know it happened.	Jo witte dat it bard is.
I'm sure you'll be just fine.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo sille wêze gewoan goed.
They could do much better next year.	Se kinne takom jier folle better.
She was not happy, but there was nothing she could do.	Se wie net bliid, mar der wie neat dat se dwaan koe.
What she had in mind would probably not work.	Wat se yn gedachten hie soe wierskynlik net wurkje.
He looked closely.	Hy seach goed nei.
The woman lives alone.	De frou wennet allinnich.
Very few people are.	Hiel pear minsken binne.
I did not think of it as anything other than what it was.	Ik tocht der net oer as wat oars as wat it wie.
The children are happy.	De bern binne bliid.
Nobody even thought about it.	Nimmen tocht der sels oan.
I let her go.	Ik joech har ôf.
She could wait though.	Se koe wol wachtsje.
Keep going and things will pay off soon.	Hâld der mar troch en dingen sille gau betelje.
They are very good at that kind of thing.	Se binne hiel goed oer dat soarte ding.
They became friends of hers.	Se barde freonen fan har.
Or maybe she just wanted a friend.	Of miskien hie se gewoan in freon woe.
I want us to be friends.	Ik wol dat wy freonen binne.
She could not either.	Se koe ek net.
He was not a little afraid of anyone.	Hy wie net in bytsje bang foar ien.
I said he was good, and he was.	Ik sei dat hy wie goed, en hy wie.
We both love it.	Wy hâlde der beide fan.
You do not eat well.	Jo ite net goed.
Probably never.	Wierskynlik nea.
In other words, he does not even think about himself.	Mei oare wurden, hy tinkt net iens oer himsels.
You are completely alone.	Do bist hielendal allinnich.
It just may not be true.	It kin gewoan net wier wêze.
It was hard to find work.	It wie dreech om wurk te finen.
You do things differently.	Jo dogge dingen oars.
It's not really what it's about.	It is net echt wêr't it oer giet.
He leaves behind a wife and three children.	Hy lit in frou en trije bern nei.
Now off to you.	No ôf mei dy.
Maybe better than that.	Miskien better as dat.
If so, what's the way to do it?	As dat sa is, wat is de manier om dit te dwaan.
Then a new time would come.	Dan soe in nije tiid komme.
I can not find it now.	Ik kin it no net fine.
I can't believe it.	Ik kin it net leauwe.
I can not look at him.	Ik kin net nei him sjen.
But it is somehow something else.	Mar it is op ien of oare manier wat oars.
They scare me.	Se meitsje my bang.
There are many more.	Der binne folle mear.
Working with us is easy.	Wurkje mei ús is maklik.
If she wants something done, she wants it done.	As se wol dat in ding dien is, dan wol se it dien hawwe.
My kids were gone.	Myn bern wiene fuort.
This is the dog, they say.	Dit is de hûn, sizze se.
His mother is.	Syn mem is.
We need to get back to work soon.	Wy moatte gau wer oan it wurk.
Getting there is easy.	Dêr komme is maklik.
Do it right, and there it is.	Doch it goed, en der is.
Please see if you get a chance.	Sjoch asjebleaft as jo in kâns krije.
If something else happens.	As bart der wat oars.
But it does not work this way.	Mar it wurket net op dizze manier.
Not when you think about it.	Net as jo der oer tinke.
It would come in handy, he said.	It soe goed komme, sei er.
That's what we need to do.	Dat moatte wy dwaan.
It was a great day.	It wie in grutte dei.
They make him happy.	Se meitsje him bliid.
Then they can get what they want.	Dan kinne se krije wat se wolle.
It is not always necessary to have money.	It is net altyd nedich om jild te hawwen.
I thought you did too.	Ik tocht dat jo ek diene.
There was nothing left.	Der bleau neat mear oer.
People will believe what they want.	Minsken sille leauwe wat se wolle.
I worked hard to get here.	Ik wurke hurd om hjir te kommen.
What was he talking about?	Wêr hie er it oer.
Tonight the bus is here.	Jûn is de bus hjir.
You're too early.	Do bist te betiid.
Just look around.	Sjoch mar om.
I could not find him.	Ik koe him net fine.
She seemed like she wanted to eat my life.	Se like as woe se my libben ite.
She told him not to do that again.	Se sei tsjin him dat se dat net wer dwaan moast.
The police are gone now.	De plysje is no fuort.
You have three.	Jo hawwe trije.
Tomorrow worried about.	Moarn soargen oer.
Plan it in.	Plan it yn.
She felt so much better after eating.	Se fielde har safolle better nei it iten.
I will never let that happen again.	Ik sil dat noait wer barre litte.
I know this is wrong.	Ik wit dat dit ferkeard is.
This was mine now.	Dit wie myn no.
He was very angry about what had happened.	Hy wie tige lilk oer wat der bard wie.
Even if he wanted to.	Ek al woe er.
And there it was.	En dêr wie it.
There was not much to talk about.	Der wie net folle om oer te praten.
That's easy to say.	Dat is maklik te sizzen.
What is not clear is why.	Wat net dúdlik is, is wêrom.
We love that it is.	Wy hâlde dat it is.
I think we should wait and see.	Ik tink dat wy moatte wachtsje en sjen.
They can be very good.	Se kinne hiel goed wêze.
I visited her at her home.	Ik besocht har by har thús.
They need to have more.	Se moatte mear hawwe.
A bit of the man's life is in her.	In bytsje fan it libben fan 'e man is yn har.
He just wanted that to say it the.	Hy woe net dat se dit die.
I liked him very much.	Ik mocht him hiel graach.
Again this is not enough.	Ek dit is net genôch.
She wanted to go home.	Se woe nei hûs.
They are just different than you.	Se binne gewoan oars as jo.
She does not need a car or of course a house.	Se hat gjin auto of fansels in hûs nedich.
First there were the people.	Earst wiene der de minsken.
And that has never been worked on.	En dêr is nea oan wurke.
I do not know when.	Ik wit net wannear.
But with or without me it would happen.	Mar mei of sûnder my soe it barre.
It was so hard.	It wie sa dreech.
Please let me know about this.	Lit my asjebleaft witte oer dit.
You put it so clearly.	Jo sette it sa dúdlik.
Could not do anything with it.	Koe der neat mei.
Of what she never had, and now never will.	Fan wat se noait hie, en no noait sil.
My father has been ill.	Myn heit hat siik west.
You would be surprised what is there, maybe what you actually like.	Jo soene ferrast wêze wat der is, miskien wat jo eins leuk fine.
He does that himself.	Dat docht er dan sels.
This here, and there and there.	Dit hjir, en dêr en dêr.
That, of course, is still possible.	Dat kin fansels noch sa.
But not easy.	Mar net maklik.
I'm really looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der echt nei út.
Or not.	Of net.
She said she was very angry at her.	Se sei dat se tige lilk op har wie.
He must have some reason.	Hy moat wat reden hawwe.
I could never have children again.	Ik koe noait wer bern krije.
She was well in bed.	Se wie goed op bêd.
Do not even try.	Net iens besykje.
I gave this to him.	Ik haw dit oan him jûn.
She will never believe me.	Se sil my nea leauwe.
Where the girl was.	Wêr't it famke wie.
I'm coming back for you.	Ik kom werom foar dy.
And that's all there's.	En dat is alles wat der is.
I had one of them.	Ik hie der ien fan.
She needed to know everything.	Se moast alles witte.
She was the mother of three children.	Se wie mem fan trije bern.
You do not need that.	Dat hawwe jo net nedich.
That was fun.	Dat wie leuk.
Maybe you're too old for me.	Miskien bist te âld foar my.
You can do this at home, people.	Jo kinne dit thús dwaan, minsken.
He would leave his car for me.	Hy soe syn auto foar my litte.
Well, go do it.	No, gean doch it.
She could not believe what she saw.	Se koe net leauwe wat se seach.
Well, do not tell them.	Goed, fertel se net.
Her husband should not be out of himself.	Har man moat net út himsels.
Just a little.	Mar in bytsje.
It had to be made.	It moast makke wurde.
It’s the same with people.	It is itselde mei minsken.
That was not necessary.	Dat wie net nedich.
It can only be given.	It kin allinnich jûn wurde.
You will not win.	Jo sille net winne.
Everything had to be done well.	Alles moast goed dien wurde.
I did not know what happened.	Ik wist net wat der bard is.
It seemed to go well at first.	It like earst goed te gean.
The boy does not know what he is saying.	De jonge wit net wat er seit.
We were certainly not in trouble.	Wy wiene wis net yn problemen.
It was very different.	It wie hiel oars.
That's exactly what we'll do.	Dat sille wy krekt dwaan.
Or just out.	Of gewoan út.
And here you heard earlier about.	En hjir hearde jo earder oer.
He thought about that.	Dêr tocht er oer.
He had no idea where he was.	Hy hie gjin idee wêr't er wie.
Really, we did.	Echt, wy diene.
You can never win.	Jo kinne nea winne.
And we want to ask.	En wy wolle freegje.
There is not much water here.	Der is hjir net folle wetter.
We are working on it today.	Der wurdt hjoed oan wurke.
But she did not worry.	Mar se makke gjin soargen.
Do what you have to do.	Doch wat jo dwaan moatte.
This is one of the few.	Dit is ien fan de pear.
And boy, was it fun.	En jonge, wie it leuk.
But that did not happen at all.	Mar dat barde net hielendal.
That's the kind of thing he would say.	Dat is it soarte fan dingen dy't er sizze soe.
That he could see.	Dat koe er sjen.
I feel like they should leave at once.	Ik fiel dat se yn ien kear fuort moatte.
There will be none of that.	Dêr sil neat fan wêze.
I would not wait.	Ik soe net wachtsje.
Tell me the truth.	Fertel my de wierheid.
I want some time alone with you.	Ik wol wat tiid allinnich mei dy.
That you can try.	Dat kinne jo besykje.
That's where we are, man.	Dat is wêr't wy binne, man.
No one knew where he was.	Nimmen wist wêr't er wie.
She felt angry.	Se fielde har lilk.
They had a very bad time.	Se hiene hiel min tiid.
I'm not sure.	Ik bin der net wis fan.
The first woman.	De earste frou.
Not once but three times.	Net ien kear mar trije kear.
He does not look well.	Hy sjocht der net goed út.
She looked up at him.	Se seach nei him op.
There's nothing we can do now.	D'r is neat dat wy no kinne dwaan.
We actually do not know much.	Wy witte eins net folle.
Not even for hours.	Net iens foar oeren.
Now you know why.	No witte jo wêrom.
It was my job.	It wie myn wurk.
He was just.	Hy wie gewoan.
She's a good kid.	Se is in goed bern.
Talk to someone.	Mei immen praat.
It was so hard to even look at her.	It wie sa dreech om sels nei har te sjen.
This is just not true.	Dit is gewoan net wier.
He did not want to return to the office.	Hy woe net werom nei it kantoar.
Otherwise we have what we have.	Oars hawwe wy wat wy hawwe.
We're going home.	Wy geane nei hûs.
She wants nothing more to do with him.	Se wol neat mear mei him te krijen hawwe.
He's ready.	Hy is klear.
Take the money.	Nim it jild.
I see you need help.	Ik sjoch dat jo help nedich hawwe.
We have had enough of him.	Wy hawwe genôch fan him.
I want that too.	Dat wol ik ek wol.
That's how it is.	Dat is hoe't it is.
She walked by that road.	Se rûn by dy wei.
She has been busy.	Se hat it drok hân.
Go inside the house and get something good to eat.	Gean yn 'e hûs en krije wat goed te iten.
For whatever this was.	Foar wat dit ek wie.
To tell the truth, this is not the first time.	Om de wierheid te fertellen, dit is net de earste kear.
They could not have one.	Se koene net ien hawwe.
We're ready to go.	Wy binne klear om fuort te gean.
Hope you are fine.	Hoopje dat jo goed binne.
As much as you want.	Sa folle as jo wolle.
None of that happened.	Gjin fan dat barde.
Knew there was someone else.	Wist dat der noch ien wie.
Let me say nothing more.	Lit my neat mear sizze.
Think of life itself.	Tink oan it libben sels.
What they said.	Wat se seine.
This may not be enough.	Dit kin net genôch wêze.
He became angry.	Hy waard lilk.
I was one.	Ik wie ien.
Well, it's clear what we need to do now.	No, it is dúdlik wat wy no moatte dwaan.
Well, you get the idea.	No, jo krije it idee.
Why is he so scared?	Wêrom is er sa bang?
There is no reason to worry about.	Der is gjin reden om soargen oer.
I tried this today for the first time.	Ik besocht dizze hjoed foar it earst.
Now everything became clear.	No waard alles dúdlik.
Another teacher comes to the school.	In oare learaar komt by de skoalle.
All she knew was that she needed to talk to him.	Alles wat se wist wie dat se mei him prate moast.
I did not want this for you.	Ik woe dit net foar dy.
But now he could not.	Mar no koe er net.
He will be here this weekend.	Hy sil hjir yn it wykein wêze.
Your room is ready, of course.	Jo keamer is klear, fansels.
I waited until he got home.	Ik wachte oant er thús kaam.
She had not been afraid.	Se hie net bang west.
I was so tired.	Ik wie sa wurch.
Whether they like it or not.	Oft se it leuk fine of net.
And money is nice too.	En jild is ek moai.
Try it on.	Besykje it op.
We would love to have your help.	Wy wolle graach jo help hawwe.
That party was too fun.	Dat feest wie te leuk.
They had never heard me speak so clearly.	Se hiene my noch noait sa dúdlik praten heard.
I have not bought mine all the time.	Ik haw de myn de hiele tiid net kocht.
If you want to make more, work harder.	As jo ​​​​mear meitsje wolle, wurkje dan mear.
Will not be anymore.	Sil net mear wêze.
We're ready to go.	Wy binne klear om te gean.
I think you're going.	Ik tink dat jo geane.
I'll be back in a few hours.	Ik kom oer in pear oeren werom.
These were people with whom she went to school.	Dit wiene minsken mei wa't se nei skoalle gie.
As a teacher.	As learaar.
We could do a lot of things if we had more money.	Wy koene in protte dingen dwaan, as wy mear jild hiene.
Now she had two.	No hie se twa.
This time it did not open.	Dizze kear gie it net iepen.
It was obviously much more than that.	It wie fansels folle mear as dat.
What you need is what you need.	Wat jo nedich hawwe is wat jo nedich hawwe.
And in that way.	En op dy manier.
Friends would ask her why she stayed.	Freonen soene har freegje wêrom't se bleau.
It was not, of course.	It wie net, fansels.
He was probably for everyone.	Hy wie wierskynlik foar elkenien.
Even by day.	Sels by dei.
She did not look up, did not speak.	Se seach net op, prate net.
It's hard to talk about.	It is dreech om oer te praten.
You will win a lot from here.	Jo sille hjir in protte fan winne.
It could not be better.	It koe net better.
Many people have done it for you.	In protte minsken hawwe it foar jo dien.
These are the problems.	Dit binne de problemen.
They had no job.	Se hiene gjin wurk.
I want to talk about hope.	Ik wol it oer hope hawwe.
She came to tell me.	Se kaam my te fertellen.
She always said what he was going to say.	Se sei altyd wat er fan plan wie te sizzen.
Come on, you can handle this.	Kom op, jo kinne dit oan.
Not twice in one day.	Net twa kear op ien dei.
But never so.	Mar nea sa.
And how happy she was to be with me.	En wat wie se bliid om by my te wêzen.
We were all children of the same parents.	Wy wiene allegear bern fan deselde âlden.
Something happened.	Der is wat bard.
Now she knew better.	No wist se better.
Now he does.	No docht er.
Nothing could ever be good without her.	Neat koe ea goed wêze sûnder har.
Nobody knew what he was going to say.	Nimmen wist wat hy soe sizze.
Or whatever you can think of.	Of wat jo kinne tinke oan.
If it does not, then do it.	As it net docht, meitsje it dan.
That's been going the last three days.	Dat is de lêste trije dagen gien.
We're going there.	Wy geane der hinne.
I'll see for myself.	Ik sil der sels op sjen.
Someone else to talk to.	Immen oars om mei te praten.
So to speak.	Sa te sizzen.
This works well.	Dit wurket goed.
He tried not to tell me it would be okay.	Hy besocht my net te fertellen dat it goed soe wêze.
He hoped she would not let it go.	Hy hope dat se it net litte soe.
Or you let them know.	Of jo litte se witte.
People are not so different.	Minsken binne net sa oars.
Do it for the people who care about you.	Doch it foar de minsken dy't om dy soargje.
With one day a week.	Mei ien dei yn 'e wike.
It was not a very nice place.	It wie net in hiel moai plak.
None of this would go well.	Gjin fan dit soe goed gean.
Everything seems to be going well.	Alles liket goed te gean.
You should have done this before.	Jo moatte dit earder dien hawwe.
To watch a movie.	Om in film te sjen.
It was a thing of the past.	It wie in ding fan it ferline.
I'm too busy today.	Ik bin hjoed te drok.
You take them at their word.	Jo nimme se op har wurd.
That made me very happy.	Dat makke my tige bliid.
They have me.	Se hawwe my.
But nothing of the sort is found.	Mar neat fan it soarte wurdt fûn.
To find out who I am now.	Om út te finen wa't ik no bin.
I had never been there, not even.	Ik hie der nea west, net iens.
I think it will work.	Ik tink dat it sil wurkje.
I'm really going out of my way to counter it.	Ik gean echt út 'e wei om it tsjin te kommen.
Why not with him ?.	Wêrom net mei him?.
Tell me how you're doing.	Fertel my hoe't it mei jo giet.
There's nothing that this girl will not try.	D'r is neat dat dit famke net sil besykje.
He has a dog.	Hy hat in hûn.
She does not.	Dat docht se net.
It's a person.	It is in persoan.
He knew he had to leave.	Hy wist dat er fuort moast.
I want something.	Ik wol wat.
Those are my favorite days.	Dat binne myn favorite dagen.
I can never let that happen again.	Ik kin dat noait wer barre litte.
You can not get away from it.	Jo kinne der net fan ôf.
Of course you want to do it better.	Fansels wolle jo it better dwaan.
What can be done?	Wat kin dien wurde?
Nothing would happen to him or the other.	Der soe neat mei him of de oare barre.
She thought he was wrong.	Se tocht dat er ferkeard wie.
It is not so.	It is net sa.
I was not sure who I would talk to first.	Ik wie net wis mei wa't ik earst prate soe.
I've been thinking a lot about this place lately.	Ik haw de lêste tiid in protte oer dit plak tocht.
He had been waiting for her all day.	Hy hie de hiele dei op har wachte.
No one had seen him.	Nimmen hie him sjoen.
I will not let him do this.	Ik lit him dit net dwaan.
The boy today is just not himself.	De jonge is hjoed gewoan net himsels.
He knew we had him.	Hy wist dat wy him hiene.
Let's see how.	Lit ús sjen hoe.
You did everything.	Jo hawwe alles dien.
They were not interested.	Se wiene net ynteressearre.
You are not alone in this.	Jo binne net allinnich yn dit.
Maybe you can help us.	Miskien kinne jo ús helpe.
It's a work of two men.	It is in wurk fan twa man.
And so he had every reason to be.	En sa hie er alle reden om te wêzen.
But he wants the food.	Mar hy wol it iten.
I have no money.	Ik haw gjin jild.
She can be free.	Se kin frij wêze.
It went really well.	It gie echt goed.
I know he knows it.	Ik wit dat hy it wit.
Takes a picture of it.	Makket der in foto fan.
Are among the best of the film.	Binne ûnder de bêste fan 'e film.
He knows we do not have that.	Hy wit dat wy dat net hawwe.
Now it's gone.	No is it fuort.
He wanted me to return to his place with him.	Hy woe dat ik werom nei syn plak by him.
This could not happen.	Dit koe net barre.
I need to talk to her.	Ik moat mei har prate.
It's going down pretty hard.	It giet aardich hurd ôf.
This was not his house, his life.	Dit wie net syn hûs, syn libben.
He had no good plan.	Hy hie gjin goed plan.
I had to do this myself.	Ik moast dit sels dwaan.
Seen from her was gone.	Sjoen fan har wie fuort.
So should we.	Dat moatte wy ek.
If it were, everyone would do it.	As it wie, soe elkenien it dwaan.
Or else she was afraid of getting into trouble.	Of oars wie se bang om yn de problemen te kommen.
People are tired, they are getting ready to go home.	Minsken binne wurch, se meitsje har klear om nei hûs te gean.
I could not quite tell it.	Ik koe it net hielendal fertelle.
There was still a chance.	Der wie noch in kâns.
I do not feel so good.	Ik fiel my net sa goed.
He can have as many children as he wants.	Hy kin safolle bern krije as er wol.
A great great great size.	In grutte grutte grutte.
I'm not coming with you.	Ik kom net mei dy.
Not for long.	No net lang.
She wants you home.	Se wol dy thús.
That would be the only way.	Dat soe de ienige manier wêze.
She's the only alarm clock.	Se is de iennichste wekker.
And it will wait until tomorrow.	En it sil wachtsje oant moarn.
They probably love each other too.	Se hâlde wierskynlik ek fan elkoar.
That was tomorrow.	Dat wie moarn.
Would like to know if it was so or not.	Wol graach witte oft it sa wie of net.
The more you are.	Hoe mear jo binne.
He would never go to her.	Hy soe nea nei har ta.
Does anyone have an idea of ​​what's going on.	Hat immen in idee fan wat der bart.
I think the city did it too.	Ik tink dat de stêd it ek dien hat.
We are all here and we love you.	Wy binne hjir allegear en wy hâlde fan dy.
And in the water.	En yn it wetter.
And a lot of work.	En in protte wurk.
For the weekend.	Foar it wykein.
He approached her.	Hy kaam by har ta.
He just came to me.	Hy kaam net by my.
They both find it here.	Se fine it hjir beide.
Finding him will not be a problem.	It finen fan him sil gjin probleem wêze.
She has done a good job.	Se hat goed wurk dien.
Buy something for your wife.	Keapje wat foar dyn frou.
That was not a problem here.	Dat wie hjir net in probleem.
I'm ready myself, in a way.	Ik bin sels klear, op in manier.
I'm never in a car.	Ik sit noait yn in auto.
Something's happening here.	Der bart hjir wat.
He thinks you're alone.	Hy tinkt datst allinnich bist.
Boy, it's late.	Jonge, it is let.
That just will not work.	Dat sil gewoan net wurkje.
With one hand.	Mei ien hân.
But these seemed different.	Mar dizze like oars.
You need to keep this person in your life.	Jo moatte dizze persoan yn jo libben hâlde.
You just have to look around.	Jo moatte gewoan om jo hinne sjen.
There was nothing to say.	Der hoegde neat te sizzen.
We'll just see what happens.	Wy sille mar sjen wat der bart.
Look at her.	Sjoch nei har.
We still have some time.	Wy hawwe noch wat tiid.
What would she see? 	Wat soe se sjen?
Of course we do not want that.	Dat wol ús fansels net.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
You will find what you need.	Jo sille fine wat jo nedich hawwe.
I'm going now.	Ik gean no.
And it never leaves.	En it lit noait op.
Scare me.	Meitsje my bang.
I asked him what he wanted.	Ik frege him wat er woe.
Now we know why.	No witte wy wêrom.
There could have been.	Der koe west hawwe.
I'm sure it should be the last one.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it lêste wêze moat.
They are already done with reading.	Se binne al klear mei lêzen.
You can have children.	Jo kinne bern hawwe.
It was at hand.	It wie by de hân.
Can't wait to get time to read it.	Kin net wachtsje om tiid te krijen om it te lêzen.
Well, done as it will be.	No, sa dien as it sil wurde.
I will be careful.	Ik sil foarsichtich wêze.
There would have been a time for such a word.	Der soe in tiid west hawwe foar sa'n wurd.
It's nice to have her back in my life.	It is moai om har werom te hawwen yn myn libben.
He would have just been with her.	Hy soe krekt mei har west hawwe.
I also do not know why he did that.	Ik wit ek net wêrom er dat dien hat.
Of course we do not.	Fansels dogge wy net.
He's ready to go.	Hy is klear om te gean.
If you become ill and.	As jo ​​wurden siik en.
She was talking and talking.	Se wie oan it praten en praten.
I would love to see that.	Dat soe ik wol graach sjen wolle.
He got it wrong.	Hy krige it ferkeard.
That's what they say.	Dat sizze se.
The children are waiting.	De bern wachtsje.
That's what we saw.	Dat hawwe wy sjoen.
Now that's gone.	No is dat fuort.
He had to take it back.	Hy moast it werom nimme.
She knew that man.	Se koe dy man.
I would stay with him.	Ik soe by him bliuwe.
It could be wrong.	It kin ferkeard wêze.
People seem to want more than they need.	Minsken lykje mear te wolle dan se nedich binne.
That can be good, it can not.	Dat kin goed, it kin net.
There is still nothing in them.	Der sit noch neat yn har.
Otherwise do something else.	Oars dwaan wat oars.
The child never returned.	It bern kaam nea werom.
To go home, that is.	Om nei hûs te gean, dat wol.
And maybe in her mind it seemed so.	En miskien yn har gedachten like it sa.
My mother did not tell me that.	Myn mem hat my dat net ferteld.
All this had become just words, words alone.	Dit alles wie gewoan wurden, allinnich wurden.
This photo is very clear.	Dizze foto is heul dúdlik.
There are people here who want to help.	Der binne hjir minsken dy't helpe wolle.
There's party.	Der is feest.
Or maybe not everyone knows that.	Of miskien wit elkenien dat net.
She wanted him, and only him.	Se woe him, en allinnich him.
She wanted to ask him, but knew she could not speak.	Se woe him freegje, mar wist dat se net prate koe.
This was not my idea.	Dit wie net myn idee.
The whole class watched, waiting for him to do something.	De hiele klasse seach nei, wachte op him wat te dwaan.
You're up there.	Do bist der op.
They will have more.	Se sille mear hawwe.
Everyone knows everything.	Elkenien wit alles.
He knows he stands for good.	Hy wit dat er foar goed stiet.
Not bad for not doing much.	Net min om net folle te dwaan.
I knew exactly what my mother would think.	Ik wist krekt wat myn mem tinke soe.
True, if we were to eat them.	Wier, as wy har ite soene.
We do the best we can.	Wy dogge it bêste dat wy kinne.
Just show that you are doing something right.	Lit gewoan sjen dat jo wat goed dogge.
It does not need.	It hat gjin nedich.
Maybe that was all.	Miskien wie dat alles.
What happened once would happen again.	Wat der ien kear barde, soe wer barre.
It does not seem to show today.	It liket hjoed net te sjen.
This is something else.	Dit is wat oars.
School was out.	Skoalle wie út.
Of course he would.	Fansels soe hy.
I think this is different for everyone.	Ik tink dat dit foar elkenien oars is.
It only needs faith.	It hat allinnich leauwe nedich.
It's been a good day.	It hat in goede dei west.
They do not like what you do with them.	Se hâlde net fan wat jo mei har dogge.
I see everything differently.	Ik sjoch alles oars.
That's just me.	Dat bin ik gewoan.
Now you can have a seat.	No kinne jo in sit hawwe.
He could no longer hold him.	Hy koe him net mear hâlde.
We would not make it.	Wy soene it net meitsje.
He knew what he had in his wife.	Hy wist wat er yn syn frou hie.
That was not the first thing he said to her.	Dat wie net it earste wat er tsjin har sei.
I knew you would come back.	Ik wist dat jo werom soene.
This is the first problem.	Dit is it earste probleem.
It was just time.	It wie krekt tiid.
I'm ready to read this book.	Ik bin ree om dit boek te lêzen.
We will tell the truth.	Wy sille de wierheid fertelle.
I'm never sure to say anything more about her.	Ik bin noait wis wat mear oer har te sizzen.
That they are not now.	Dat binne se no net.
Why does he say nothing, he asked himself.	Wêrom seit er neat, frege er him ôf.
And, it was no question.	En, it wie gjin fraach.
It seemed like a whole life ago.	It like in hiele libben lyn.
I just looked at her.	Ik seach har mar oan.
He knew everything he needed to know.	Hy wist alles wat er witte moast.
We never are.	Wy binne nea.
I felt like a child again.	Ik fielde my wer in bern.
As it goes, it goes.	As it giet, giet it.
She opened the door.	Se die de doar iepen.
Can not go wrong if you do.	Kin net ferkeard gean as jo it dogge.
You can 't believe anyone.	Jo kinne gjinien it leauwe.
He came to us for help.	Hy kaam by ús om help.
Go on.	Gean troch.
I asked the man to please open the door.	Ik frege de man om asjebleaft de doar iepen te dwaan.
He loves his room and his bed.	Hy hâldt fan syn keamer en syn bêd.
I'm not one of those people.	Ik bin net ien fan dy minsken.
You can not see the house, you say.	Jo kinne it hûs net sjen, sizze jo.
It was nice to see you.	It wie moai dy te sjen.
They never think they will, but they do.	Se tinke nea dat se sille, mar se dogge.
Last night was no different.	Fannacht wie net oars.
Everyone wants to do better.	Elkenien wol it better dwaan.
I think there are some good things.	Ik tink dat der wat goede dingen.
I know better now.	Ik wit no better.
All do words.	Alle dwaan wurden.
And neither do you.	En jo ek net.
I do not doubt it.	Ik twifelje der net oan.
It was decided on an evening.	It waard op in jûn besletten.
Say it all hard.	Se die alles hurd.
It's this movie.	It is dizze film.
I just can not believe it.	Ik kin it gewoan net leauwe.
That was it, she thought.	Dat wie it, tocht se.
We did that well.	Dat ha wy goed dien.
I do not know where they went.	Ik wit net wêr't se hinne gien binne.
She knows she can.	Se wit dat se kin.
He's just such a man.	Hy is krekt sa'n man.
I have a lot to tell you.	Ik haw jo in protte te fertellen.
That can not be good.	Dat kin net goed.
She made him wish that morning would never come.	Se liet him winskje dat de moarn noait komme soe.
See, it's just hard.	Sjoch, it is gewoan dreech.
It does not work.	It wurket net.
It's a nice thing to have friends.	It is in moai ding om freonen te hawwen.
I can not stand this anymore!	Ik kin dit net mear oan!
He got in his car.	Hy kaam yn syn auto.
But really what can they say.	Mar echt wat kinne se sizze.
It's the last day of school.	It is de lêste dei fan skoalle.
Let me know if that's the problem.	Lit my witte as dat it probleem is.
I can not wait any longer.	Ik kin net mear wachtsje.
You can live with me at home.	Jo kinne by my thús wenje.
He had the chance.	Hy hie de kâns.
It was very nice.	It wie tige aardich.
I'm sure we will.	Ik bin der wis fan dat wy sille.
It struck me about three years ago.	It rekke my sa'n trije jier lyn.
I think that's where we're going.	Ik tink dat is wêr't wy nei gean.
She went out, left the door open.	Se gie út, liet de doar iepen.
Everyone else knows them.	Elkenien oars ken se.
I know it did not really hurt you.	Ik wit dat it jo net echt sear die.
You will be out.	Jo sille út wêze.
I wanted both.	Ik woe beide.
But that was not the point.	Mar dêr gie it net om.
And there was something different about her, too.	En der wie ek wat oars oan har.
He cares.	Hy docht der om.
If you can not find one.	As jo ​​net kinne fine in.
His father too.	Syn heit ek.
He's fine now.	Hy is der no goed út.
I think you can not do that.	Ik tink dat jo dat net kinne.
No one has ever said otherwise.	Nimmen hat ea oars sein.
He was through talking to me.	Hy wie troch mei my te praten.
Allow them to be so.	Jou se sa te wêzen.
Hold it for a week.	Hâld it in wike yn.
Try it and let me know how it works.	Besykje it en lit my witte hoe't it wurket.
I kept thinking that tomorrow would be better.	Ik bleau tinke dat moarn better wêze soe.
Even if there was a problem, the work was never done well.	Sels as der in probleem wie, waard it wurk noait goed dien.
That does not matter now.	Dat hoecht no net.
I have to go now.	Ik moat no fuort.
He needs to work on the last problem.	Hy moat oan it lêste probleem wurkje.
There was only water now.	Der wie no allinnich mar wetter.
He wants you to come home.	Hy wol dat jo thús komme.
Maybe too much.	Miskien te folle.
This is just not true.	Dit is gewoan net wier.
Even if that.	Sels as dat.
I know of nothing.	Ik wit fan neat.
And she liked him.	En se mocht him graach.
These are the best.	Dit binne de bêste.
We would be much better off without it.	Wy soene der folle better sûnder wêze.
He must be careful.	Hy moat foarsichtich wêze.
No one had seen or heard from her in two days.	Nimmen hie har yn twa dagen sjoen of fan har heard.
I was so angry.	Ik wie sa lilk.
She did not think so, and she was hurt.	Se tocht it net, en se rekke sear.
He's coming home next week.	Hy komt nije wike werom nei hûs.
Of course, it could not eat either.	It koe fansels ek net ite.
I have to get out of here.	Ik moat hjir wei.
She did not even look at him.	Se seach net iens nei him.
It was about my family.	It gie oer myn famylje.
He did not really know about it, not enough to be sure.	Hy wist der eins net iens fan, net genôch om der wis fan te wêzen.
It would have been nice though.	It hie wol moai west.
Now it can not be found.	No kin it net fûn wurde.
That really made my day !.	Dat makke myn dei echt!.
I doubt it will happen.	Ik twifelje dat it barre sil.
They are my friends.	It binne myn freonen.
We are not sure what we think about that.	Wy binne net wis wat wy tinke oer dat.
And they do just that.	En dat dogge se krekt.
Or knew him.	Of koe him.
I thought of him.	Ik haw oan him tocht.
We're leaving.	Wy gean fuort.
Do not hurt him.	Doch him net sear.
I will be more than ready.	Ik sil mear as klear wêze.
I had nothing else.	Ik hie neat oars.
And it really is.	En it is echt.
Very sure he will have a very good read.	Hiel wis dat hy in heul goed lêzen sil hawwe.
She needs all the help she can get.	Se hat alle help nedich dy't se krije kin.
It seems like there's a lot we do not know about him.	It liket derop dat d'r in protte is dy't wy net oer him witte.
I made up an entire family.	Ik makke in hiele famylje út.
I feel that man.	Ik fiel dy man.
He knows nothing of nothing.	Hy wit neat fan neat.
This work should be ready tomorrow.	Dit wurk moat moarn klear wêze.
That's what we did.	Dat diene wy.
This young man is sick.	Dizze jonge man is siik.
A man everyone liked.	In man dy't elkenien leuk hie.
I wanna go.	Ik wol gean.
A man who does the work.	In man dy't it wurk docht.
It was evening now.	It wie no jûn.
There were still two days to go.	Der wiene noch twa dagen te gean.
You agreed that you love me too.	Jo wiene it iens dat jo ek fan my hâlde.
Nothing to worry about.	Neat te soargen oer.
But it seems like a difficult thing to do.	Mar it liket in dreech ding om te dwaan.
I know we have a lot of things.	Ik wit dat wy in protte dingen hawwe.
I do not make much money.	Ik meitsje net folle jild.
More out than on.	Mear út as oan.
Nobody tried to talk him out of it.	Nimmen besocht him der út te praten.
But it was so clear, no one would want it.	Mar it wie sa dúdlik, gjinien soe it wolle.
He saw nothing left.	Hy seach neat oer.
I go to school.	Ik gean nei skoalle.
That's the best way to put it, maybe.	Dat is de bêste manier om it te sizzen, miskien.
And now, come here.	En no, kom hjir.
No idea why exactly.	Gjin idee wêrom krekt.
He went over.	Hy gie oer.
We are no different than anyone else.	Wy binne net oars as immen oars.
But feel what you have obviously done.	Mar fiel wat jo fansels dien hawwe.
But first.	Mar earst.
You can let me know when you are ready.	Jo kinne my witte as jo klear binne.
It was really like some kind of movie.	It wie echt as in soarte fan film.
It's a nice old house.	It is in moai âld hûs.
And he's nice.	En hy is leuk.
It's just who she is.	It is gewoan wa't se is.
I just can not.	Ik kin gewoan net.
You make me so angry!	Jo meitsje my sa lilk!
You may have one of these problems in your life.	Jo hawwe miskien ien fan dizze problemen yn jo libben.
These people were with him.	Dizze minsken wiene by him.
But they keep going.	Mar se hâlde der oan.
Or in the past.	Of yn it ferline.
Just one of many problems.	Krekt ien fan in protte problemen.
Tell me that yourself.	Sei my dat sels.
Sa lang dan.	Sa lang dan.
I had never seen such a thing.	Ik hie noch noait sa'n ding sjoen.
This photo is of my house.	Dizze foto is fan myn hûs.
And it was expected.	En it waard ferwachte.
He said he felt bad.	Hy sei dat it him min fielde.
She could not do much more of this.	Se koe hjir net folle mear fan.
Get there soon.	Kom der gau.
They just can not see that what they have done is wrong.	Se kinne gewoan net sjen dat wat se dien hawwe ferkeard is.
There was no time to eat.	Der wie gjin tiid om te iten.
Just that it was a bad time for me.	Krekt dat it in minne tiid foar my wie.
She heard it clearly.	Se hearde it dúdlik.
You had a plan.	Jo hiene in plan.
Think of the time he will have.	Tink oan 'e tiid dy't hy sil hawwe.
He wanted to do more than that.	Hy woe mear dwaan as dat.
And she's always beautiful.	En se is altyd moai.
Anyone who sees that child.	Elkenien dy't dat bern sjocht.
But there is no way it can be true.	Mar d'r is gjin manier dat it wier kin wêze.
A fan.	In fan.
Not that day.	Net dy dei.
Shall we go to dinner?	Sille wy nei iten gean?
Then back again.	Dan wer werom.
He should have thought more about it.	Hy hie der mear oer tinke moatten.
And it must be.	En it moat wêze.
They were happy for him as a person.	Se wiene bliid foar him as persoan.
Neither is really about it.	Gjin fan beide is der echt oer.
We get nothing.	Wy krije neat.
That way you can not go wrong.	Sa kinne jo net ferkeard gean.
I'm not sure where the other one went.	Ik bin der net wis fan wêr't de oare gie.
You can not try to keep everyone happy.	Jo kinne net besykje elkenien bliid te hâlden.
And why not.	En wêrom net.
Whatever happens to you, it's good.	Wat foar dy komt, it is goed.
Nobody expected it.	Nimmen ferwachte it.
But it can not be done.	Mar it kin net dien wurde.
Not the moon, but a moon.	Net de moanne, mar in moanne.
But you would not have met her.	Mar jo soene har net moete hawwe.
You can come here.	Jo kinne hjir komme.
First you need to find one.	Earst moatte jo ien fine.
He knew it would be difficult for him to do this.	Hy wist dat it foar him dreech wêze soe om dit te dwaan.
There is nothing more.	Der is neat mear.
I've never done that before.	Dat haw ik noch noait dien.
There was one in me.	Der wie ien yn my.
It's just school.	It is gewoan skoalle.
Both are necessary.	Beide binne nedich.
No party.	Gjin feest.
I do not believe this is enough.	Ik leau net dat dit genôch is.
You need to be able to try everything you want.	Jo moatte alles kinne besykje wat jo wolle.
Need help with this.	Help nedich mei dizze.
Open the door and let's go.	Doch de doar iepen en lit ús gean.
This is not happening today.	Dit bart hjoed net.
These were things he knew.	Dit wiene dingen dy't hy wist.
It seemed too.	It like ek.
You're the only one.	Do bist de iennichste.
I did not have enough time.	Ik hie net genôch tiid.
It was clearly not good.	It wie dúdlik net goed.
I told the truth.	Ik fertelde de wierheid.
You're out of here now.	Do bist hjir no út.
I can not tell you now.	Ik kin it dy no net sizze.
Her whole life.	Har hiele libben.
We love the house.	Wy hâlde fan it hûs.
We have a job to do.	Wy hawwe in baan te dwaan.
They do not talk much.	Se prate net folle.
I think it's that she knows something.	Ik tink dat it is dat se wat wit.
That would not be easy.	Dat soe net maklik wêze.
I felt sure you would see it my way.	Ik fielde der wis fan dat jo it op myn manier soene sjen.
It was clear he was not buying.	It wie dúdlik dat er net keapje.
You just expected it to happen.	Jo hawwe gewoan ferwachte dat it soe barre.
When bad things happen to other people.	As minne dingen barre mei oare minsken.
There was more now.	Der wie no mear.
But he said nothing to anyone.	Mar hy sei tsjin gjinien neat.
We talk about it when we have more time.	Wy prate der oer as wy mear tiid hawwe.
Your hand just what happened.	Jo hân krekt wat barde.
I went and did that thing again.	Ik bin gien en dat ding wer dien.
Let him go and get ready.	Lit him gean en meitsje klear.
We do not want it either.	Wy wolle it ek net.
But so it happened.	Mar sa barde it.
We had the best time.	Wy hiene de bêste tiid.
She just wants to talk.	Se wol gewoan prate.
I do not see how you can be expected of you.	Ik sjoch net hoe't jo fan jo ferwachte wurde kinne.
To his mother.	Oan syn mem.
I've been here alone.	Ik haw hjir allinnich west.
But it had to be too much.	Mar it moast te folle wurde.
Now he could only look at her in his mind.	No koe er allinnich yn syn gedachten nei har ta.
He did not know she would do that.	Hy wist net dat se dat dwaan soe.
I need to know how he did it.	Ik moat witte hoe't er it die.
I'll pay you.	Ik sil dy betelje.
I'm happy for him, really.	Ik bin bliid foar him, echt.
Never did they look so scared.	Nea sjoen se sa bang.
That does not make our work better, but maybe wants something different.	Dat makket ús wurk net better, mar miskien wol wat oars.
They just did not live here.	Se wenne hjir gewoan net.
That he had to give	Dat hy moast jaan
He walked away.	Hy rûn fuort.
There was something wrong with that girl.	Der wie wat mei dat famke.
More than that.	Mear dan dat.
I want to see it become the best it can be.	Ik wol sjen dat it it bêste wurdt dat it kin.
There was something else at hand.	Der wie noch wat oan de hân.
I had no idea what to do!	Ik hie gjin idee wat te dwaan!
And it can be a good life.	En it kin in goed libben wêze.
We know how they are.	Wy witte hoe't se binne.
Not easy to find what you like.	Net maklik te finen wat jo leuk.
You can do more than that.	Jo kinne mear dwaan as dat.
I can tell no more.	Ik kin net mear fertelle.
It's a real problem.	It is in echt probleem.
For some reason, they never did.	Om ien of oare reden hawwe se it noait dien.
He's just himself.	Hy is gewoan himsels.
No help for it.	Gjin help foar it.
And do not come back until they come here.	En kom net werom oant se hjir komme.
This is on us.	Dizze is op ús.
You love it, whatever happens.	Jo hâlde it, wat der ek bart.
This is the place to be.	Dit is it plak om te wêzen.
These things are just fun.	Dizze dingen binne gewoan leuk.
He would still be a friend for a long time.	Hy soe noch lang in freon wêze.
He had found his place.	Hy hie syn plak fûn.
He did not make it either.	Hy makke it ek net.
It's not careful.	It is net foarsichtich.
It's gone.	It is fuort.
Be very, very careful.	Wês heul, heul foarsichtich.
She was not there long.	Se wie der net lang.
I'm not interested in having a man in my life.	Ik bin net ynteressearre yn it hawwen fan in man yn myn libben.
He still lives there.	Hy wennet dêr noch.
My friend never told me her name.	Myn freon nea fertelde my har namme.
Maybe we'll stay here a few more days.	Miskien bliuwe wy hjir noch in pear dagen.
That's a lot of time.	Dat is in protte tiid.
He does not like me.	Hy liket my net goed.
She's just in the other room.	Se is krekt yn 'e oare keamer.
Here's exactly where that person left you.	Hjir krekt wêr't dy persoan dy liet.
Nothing here is old.	Neat hjir is âld.
Just to be free.	Krekt om frij te wêzen.
I see her.	Ik sjoch har.
The question is whether that is really the case.	De fraach is oft dat echt sa is.
There is no need to be afraid of us.	D'r hoecht net bang foar ús te wêzen.
Not much different then at home.	Net folle oars as dan thús.
Maybe he did not like it.	Miskien hie er it net leuk.
And so easy to do.	En sa maklik te dwaan.
No way is right or wrong.	Gjin manier is goed of ferkeard.
I tried to do such a thing.	Ik besocht sa'n ding te dwaan.
This dog needs a good home.	Dizze hûn hat in goed hûs nedich.
We've said enough and we're going to work again.	Wy hawwe genôch sein en wy geane wer oan it wurk.
Maybe she came up with where she should not have.	Miskien kaam se op wêr't se net hie moatten.
He has not started talking.	Hy is net begûn te praten.
So there he is.	Sa is er.
This is how it goes.	Sa giet it.
He has time, and enough.	Hy hat tiid, en genôch.
You can have the house.	Jo kinne it hûs hawwe.
All of these things are good to do in your life.	Al dizze dingen binne goed te dwaan yn jo libben.
You knew it was coming.	Jo wisten dat it kaam.
I just did not think this would work.	Ik tocht gewoan net dat dit soe wurkje.
He thought he had done it.	Hy tocht dat er it dien hie.
I'm sure of such a bit.	Ik bin wis fan sa'n bytsje.
He wanted to do what was good.	Hy woe dwaan wat goed wie.
It seemed like hours.	It like oeren.
And now it knew what she was.	En no wist it wat se wie.
I asked something.	Ik frege wat.
And who can that be, you say.	En wa mei dat wêze, sizze jo.
No two people go through the same thing.	Gjin twa minsken geane itselde troch.
They are all friends.	Se binne allegear freonen.
It was something else.	It wie wat oars.
She must have said a little something to him.	Se moat in bytsje wat tsjin him sein hawwe.
That was a lot.	Dat wie in protte.
There is nothing to do now.	Der is no neat foar te dwaan.
It is not today either.	It is hjoed ek net.
Or does not matter.	Of makket neat út.
You have that chance.	Jo hawwe dy kâns.
They are both and they are beautiful and they are whole.	Se binne beide en se binne moai en se binne hiel.
Things were better for everyone when she was here.	Dingen wiene better foar elkenien doe't se hjir wie.
She will not take me.	Se sil my net nimme.
I bought them from her mother.	Ik kocht har fan har mem.
I'm ready for it.	Ik bin der klear foar.
A good year.	In goed jier.
In a good way.	Op in goede manier.
Do you want something?	Wolle jo wat?
He can make it.	Hy kin it meitsje.
It was not the best.	It wie net de bêste.
I have other problems.	Ik haw oare problemen.
Everything here was and is.	Alles hjir wie en is.
It really is her.	It is echt har.
That's what's already happening.	Dat is wat dat al bart.
She didn't care about that either.	Dêr hie se ek neat om.
It's very nice, isn 't it?	It is hiel moai, is it net?
He did not feel it even.	Hy fielde it net iens.
Soon the money was up.	Al gau wie it jild op.
We need to do something.	Wy moatte wat dwaan.
We have to go back.	Wy moatte werom.
The question is how do we find that.	De fraach is hoe't wy dat fine.
Of course she would not.	Dat soe se fansels net.
To find out more, check it out here.	Om mear te finen, sjoch it hjir.
I'll know how.	Ik sil witte hoe.
I know my hair.	Ik ken myn hier.
And so we think about it.	En sa tinke wy der oer.
Well, look no further.	No, sjoch net mear.
I can believe that.	Dat kin ik leauwe.
But it was not the only one.	Mar it wie net de ienige.
You can find it.	Jo kinne it fine.
This went on for a very long time.	Dit gie hiel lang troch.
It will be very nice.	It sil hiel moai wêze.
I know, and everyone here knows exactly where she is.	Ik wit, en elkenien hjir wit, krekt wêr't se is.
Nobody wants to stay here.	Gjinien wol hjir bliuwe.
Where he comes from we know nothing.	Wêr't er wei komt witte wy neat.
Go home now.	Gean no nei hûs.
He told me.	Hy fertelde my .
Three years early.	Trije jier betiid.
I was angry and hurt.	Ik wie lilk en sear.
My husband is coming out.	Myn man komt út.
If not, try these.	As net, besykje dizze.
My dad loved making friends.	Myn heit wie graach freonen te meitsjen.
He sees, he sees nothing.	Hy sjocht, hy sjocht neat.
That is for the child himself.	Dat is foar it bern sels.
We need a new way.	Wy hawwe in nije manier nedich.
There are better to have.	Der binne better te hawwen.
This is nothing like that.	Dit is neat as dat.
I had just started.	Ik wie krekt begûn.
They do not come to the party.	Se komme net op it feest.
Well, come on then.	No, kom op dan.
It was not quite.	It wie net hielendal.
She's with you.	Se is by dy.
Every day they get a little better.	Alle dagen wurde se in bytsje better.
I think she likes you a little bit.	Ik tink dat se in bytsje fan dy hâldt.
Now his book is ready.	No is syn boek klear.
Everything he had expected was not.	Alles wat er ferwachte hie, wie net.
My father was there.	Myn heit wie der.
I want you to think about it.	Ik wol dat jo der oer tinke.
They said they did not have one.	Se seine dat se net ien hiene.
We will do the best we can.	Wy sille it bêste dwaan dat wy kinne.
It occurred to him that he could ask.	It kaam him op dat er freegje koe.
We've had our bad days.	Wy hawwe ús minne dagen mar.
There she is!	Dêr is se!
But that should not be.	Mar dat moat net.
What they are.	Wat se binne.
That's the other thing.	Dat is it oare ding.
They are scared.	Se binne bang.
The family never had enough to eat.	De famylje hie nea genôch te iten.
Of course, this does not work.	Fansels wurket dit net.
He had decided that it was not her car that he had seen.	Hy hie besletten dat it har auto net west hie dy't er sjoen hie.
That's not good.	Dat is net goed.
We do not.	Wy net.
If they serve themselves.	As se sels diene.
The size does not matter.	De grutte makket neat út.
They put their money on the first.	Se sette har jild op 'e earste.
I will try to get to him today.	Ik sil hjoed besykje om by him te kommen.
We believe this is not possible.	Wy leauwe dat dit net kin.
And he should not.	En hy moat net.
We would still make them wrong.	Wy soene se noch ferkeard meitsje.
When she got home, she found her children sick.	Doe't se thús kaam, fûn se har bern siik.
You have worked hard this year.	Jo hawwe dit jier hurd wurke.
You are not waiting for your father or his wife.	Jo wachtsje net op jo heit of syn frou.
This then is the way we should go.	Dit is dan de wei dy't wy moatte gean.
Hope you find something too !.	Hoopje dat jo ek wat fine!.
We have to go!	Wy moatte gean!
He's just the bad guy.	Hy is gewoan de minne keardel.
It did not seem to matter anymore.	It like der net mear út te meitsjen.
She was scared for her life.	Se wie bang foar har libben.
We can work with what works best for me.	Wy kinne mei wat it bêste foar my wurket.
I was sitting with him in that office.	Ik siet by him yn dat kantoar.
She looked at her father.	Se seach har heit oan.
It's the first of the month.	It is de earste fan de moanne.
A lot of people are different and they get through it.	In protte minsken binne oars en se komme der mei troch.
Maybe he had gone too hard.	Miskien wie er te hurd gien.
I'll say it again.	Ik sil it mar wer sizze.
I can do that, she said.	Dat kin ik wol, sei se.
There is so much more you can do.	D'r is safolle mear dat jo kinne dwaan.
I do not know who these people are.	Ik wit net wa't dizze minsken binne.
I got him back.	Ik krige him werom.
It serves them.	Dit diene se.
I really do not know what to do.	Ik wit echt net wat te dwaan.
If you know anyone, please let me know.	As jo ​​​​ien witte, lit it my dan witte.
They had more time.	Se hiene mear tiid.
He liked to eat this food.	Hy mocht graach dit iten ite.
He was a child.	Hy wie in bern.
Of course it is.	Fansels is it.
All days had been beautiful.	Alle dagen hiene moai west.
But he knew better than to ask.	Mar hy wist better as freegje.
We need to go and see him.	Wy moatte gean en sjen him.
For me, that will.	Foar my, dat wol.
That's his job.	Dat is syn wurk.
I met him a few days ago.	Ik moete mei him in pear dagen lyn.
When they do, they take their children to see it.	As se dogge, nimme se har bern om it te sjen.
I will never believe that.	Dat sil ik noait leauwe.
He walked to the door.	Hy rûn nei de doar.
The problem is that this does not work.	It probleem is dat dit net wurket.
It really happened.	It wie echt bard.
Just be ready to ride.	Wês gewoan klear om te riden.
And I thought she really liked me.	En ik tocht dat se my echt leuk hie.
It came out wrong.	It kaam ferkeard út.
You did it right.	Do hast it goed dien.
He actually does.	Hy docht eins.
Now it was different.	No wie it oars.
Had liked him very much.	Hie him tige leuk fûn.
His hand is free to help his other.	Syn hân is frij om syn oare te helpen.
Have a good time.	Hawwe in goede tiid.
Well, mine was too.	No, myn wie ek.
We need to talk.	Wy moatte prate.
It looks like it will not be soon.	It liket derop dat it net gau sil wêze.
I'm single.	ik bin ien.
She would have told the police for him.	Se soe de plysje foar him sein hawwe.
He did a few things, but not much.	Hy die in pear dingen, mar net folle.
He was also not a good father.	Hy wie ek gjin goede heit.
He would do it for her.	Hy soe it foar har dwaan.
Not with regret.	Net mei spyt.
It seemed different.	It like oars.
It comes to you.	It komt ta dy.
Now it is not so.	No is it net sa.
She did more than these things.	Se die mear as dizze dingen.
He wanted to do it.	Hy woe it dwaan.
He lives in the city.	Hy wennet yn 'e stêd.
Let me go!	Lit my gean!
Still had to see how my dad was.	Moast noch sjen hoe't myn heit wie.
Even if that's someone I am.	Sels as dy immen ik bin.
But my husband was gone.	Mar myn man wie fuort.
He's my dog.	Hy is myn hûn.
I have done it once and also done it.	Ik haw it ien kear dien en ek dien.
There has to be a way.	Der moat in manier wêze.
I would do it for my kids.	Ik soe it dwaan foar myn bern.
Please do not be afraid.	Wês asjebleaft net bang.
I'm not talking about this.	Ik praat net oer dit.
He knew it, I did not.	Hy wist it, ik net.
I feel pretty bad.	Ik fiel my frij min.
It will never be seen in the movie again.	It sil nea wer te sjen wêze yn 'e film.
We too.	Wy ek.
That's a lot for me.	Dat is in protte foar my.
Or almost everyone.	Of hast elkenien.
Maybe so and maybe not.	Miskien sa en miskien net.
She told me about her.	Se fertelde my oer har.
I just know, is everything.	Ik wit it gewoan, is alles.
My wife is single.	Myn frou is ien.
She would know what to do.	Se soe witte wat te dwaan.
Now it will be difficult.	No sil it dreech wurde.
I have never seen a book so difficult to obtain.	Ik haw noch noait in boek sjoen dat sa dreech te krijen is.
He will be sure to come back.	Hy sil wis wêze om werom te kommen.
He did not need one.	Hy hie net ien nedich.
I ask that we can see things differently.	Ik freegje dat wy dingen oars kinne sjen.
But the woman never looked at him.	Mar de frou seach nea nei him ta.
Take him there.	Nim him dêr hinne.
You need both.	Jo moatte beide.
That's what we do throughout the day.	Dat nimme wy de dei troch.
He said it so quickly.	Hy sei it sa gau.
his mother.	syn mem.
Why should it.	Wêrom moat it.
And it worked for me.	En it hat my wurke.
You do what you have to do.	Jo dogge wat jo moatte dwaan.
One who is not afraid of him.	Ien dy't net bang foar him.
I would have to do otherwise.	Ik soe oars moatte.
There is something else.	Der is wat oars.
Not his way.	Net syn manier.
What he just the.	Wat hy net die.
Is there anyone else out there still waiting?!?.	Is der immen oars út dêr noch wachtsje?!?.
He has been the bad boy.	Hy hat de minne jonge west.
One who could come and go without question.	Ien dy't sûnder fraach komme en gean koe.
But she never told me who he was.	Mar se hat my noait ferteld wa't hy wie.
It did not, and it could not.	It die net, en it koe net.
Let me try this.	Lit my dit besykje.
And maybe no one should tell you what to think.	En miskien moat gjinien jo fertelle wat jo tinke moatte.
It does not stop.	It hâldt net op.
Anyway, he's with that girl now.	Hoe dan ek, hy is no by dat famke.
We will stay here forever.	Wy bliuwe hjir foar altyd.
But I believe it can.	Mar ik leau dat it kin.
I do not know what would be best for everyone.	Ik wit net wat it bêste foar elkenien wêze soe.
He was already something else.	Hy wie al wat oars.
Even my bed.	Sels myn bêd.
He must be free.	Hy moat frij wêze.
I was not happy about that.	Dêr wie ik net bliid mei.
You will of course like them.	Jo fine har fansels leuk.
This is an old house.	Dit is in âld hûs.
But it will be too late.	Mar it sil te let wêze.
It was so little.	It wie sa'n bytsje.
But you got it.	Mar jo hawwe it wol.
I had to help my father.	Ik moast myn heit helpe.
I need it in life.	Ik haw it nedich yn it libben.
You come with me.	Jo komme mei my.
I do not know who that may be.	Ik wit net wa't dat wêze kin.
She has read it twice.	Se hat it twa kear lêzen.
It's his wife, and she's done for him to come.	It is syn frou, en se is dien foar him kommen.
That's what I had said to him.	Dat hie ik tsjin him sein.
Life does not happen differently.	It libben bart net oars.
He had none of this.	Hy hie hjir neat fan.
Maybe something in me had just had enough.	Miskien hie wat yn my krekt genôch hân.
She looked at the child.	Se seach nei it bern.
They did not like it.	Se koene it net leuk fine.
Just the job.	Krekt it wurk.
He needs the job.	Hy hat de baan nedich.
He wants to believe, but is afraid.	Hy wol leauwe, mar is bang.
Two things about this.	Twa dingen oer dit.
I had thought it could be difficult, but it was not.	Ik hie tocht dat it dreech wêze koe, mar it wie net.
He had no idea how he did it.	Hy hie gjin idee hoe't er it die.
I'm very happy for you.	Ik bin hiel bliid foar dy.
Everything you can think of.	Alles wêr't jo oan tinke kinne.
I thought he might be.	Ik tocht dat er miskien wêze soe.
And what for hours that they can work.	En wat foar oeren dat se wurkje kinne.
He's really into something.	Hy is echt wat yn it meitsjen.
Now that money was gone.	No wie dat jild fuort.
He was jailed last year.	Hy siet ferline jier finzenis.
She left the door open.	Se liet de doar iepen.
Not the hair.	Net it hier.
He was the one who would help me.	Hy wie dejinge dy't my helpe soe.
People need to think differently.	Minsken moatte oars tinke.
And that is not to say to you.	En dat is net oan jo te sizzen.
Think about what people are saying.	Tink oan wat minsken sizze.
That's all this is really.	Dat is alles wat dit echt is.
You can never get one.	Jo kinne noait ien krije.
I have to go back to the city.	Ik moat werom nei de stêd.
Her idea seemed to be a good idea.	Har idee like in goed idee te wêzen.
Sure, you do not want to see her.	Wis, jo wolle har net sjen.
See, you care for your parents or you do not.	Sjoch, jo soargje foar jo âlden of jo dogge it net.
Will see us soon.	Sil ús wol sjen.
We will show the following.	Wy sille it folgjende sjen litte.
For about two years, one week.	Foar sa'n twa jier, ien wike.
Now we have to go back to school.	No moatte wy werom nei skoalle.
I'm sure.	Ik bin der wis fan.
He probably lived alone.	Hy wenne wierskynlik allinnich.
Just needed to know where to find it.	Moast gewoan witte wêr te finen.
It seemed long.	It like lang.
This is how it worked.	Dit is hoe't it wurke.
It was never a question of whether.	It wie nea in fraach oft.
There did not have to be.	Der hoegde net te wêzen.
I have not even read any of them.	Ik haw net iens ien fan har lêzen.
He can not eat.	Hy kin net ite.
I'm just fine.	Ik haw it krekt goed.
Do not look down.	Sjoch net nei ûnder.
I seem to take to you at once.	Ik lykje te nimmen oan dy yn ien kear.
Very nice and not too busy.	Hiel moai en net te drok.
He worked very hard.	Hy wurke hiel hurd.
Whatever you can do will be well done.	Wat jo ek kinne dwaan sil goed dien wurde.
It took up too much of my time.	It naam te folle fan myn tiid.
That boy knows exactly what he's doing.	Dy jonge wit krekt wat er docht.
And they often do.	En dat dogge se faak.
Angry.	Lilk.
If she only knew what it was.	As se mar wist wat it wie.
She looked around.	Se seach om har hinne.
Not now, not yet.	No net, noch net.
Just keep things real, mom.	Krekt hâlden dingen echt, mem.
A few times since.	In pear kear sûnt.
I'm so glad I found you.	Ik bin sa bliid dy fûn te hawwen.
She did not know how it felt.	Se wist net hoe't it fielde.
He wished it were just the two of them.	Hy woe dat it gewoan de twa wiene.
You asked for it here.	Jo hawwe hjir om frege.
He's not here either.	Hy is hjir ek net.
This is where you go.	Dit is wêr't jo gean.
It's for sure.	It is wis.
And get out of driving.	En gean út riden.
If there had been anything, they would have gotten it.	As der wat west hie, hiene se it krigen.
And he will not give us any money.	En hy sil ús gjin jild jaan.
Another week or two will not hurt.	Noch in wike as twa sil gjin sear dwaan.
We did well today.	Wy hawwe it hjoed goed dien.
Just feel.	Fiel gewoan.
I wonder what was said to make me angry.	Ik freegje my ôf wat der sein waard om my lilk te meitsjen.
If he won, they would let him go.	As er winne soe soene se him gean litte.
There are very few of those.	D'r binne heul pear fan dy.
But there is not much time for that.	Mar dêr is net folle tiid foar.
She saw that clearly now.	Dat seach se no dúdlik.
Well, it does not matter.	No, it makket neat út.
Visit your family.	Besykje jo famylje.
And tell your friends to do the same.	En fertel dyn freonen om itselde te dwaan.
But not so here.	Mar net sa hjir.
They are interested in.	Se binne ynteressearre yn.
And maybe we are.	En miskien binne wy.
Not that he thought it would.	Net dat er tocht dat it soe.
It seems tired, it seems.	It liket wurch, liket.
I want more things to do for him.	Ik wol mear dingen dy't dat foar him dogge.
Nothing like it had ever happened to me before.	Neat as it wie ea bard mei my foar.
I do not think it's easy.	Ik tink net dat it maklik is.
The whole town seemed happy.	De hiele stêd like bliid.
He should have come sooner.	Hy hie earder komme moatten.
And every reason to do so.	En alle reden om dat te dwaan.
She knew that.	Dat wist se.
My dog ​​ran away.	Myn hûn rûn fuort.
A much better way.	In folle bettere manier.
Now you get to get on with it, same as me.	No krije jo der mei te krijen, itselde as ik.
I was there when he died.	Ik wie der doe't er stoar.
And there's more to it.	En der is mear oan it.
It eats you up.	It yt dy op.
He has no other family.	Hy hat gjin oare famylje.
But we do not have them.	Mar wy hawwe se net.
It worked for her.	It wurke foar har.
I wish this was not real.	Ik wol dat dit net echt is.
It still hurt.	It die noch sear.
They would not tell me.	Se soene it my net fertelle.
I have to stay.	Ik moat bliuwe.
Everything seemed to be in place.	Alles like op syn plak te wêzen.
I believe you are so good.	Ik leau dat jo sa goed binne.
That's his problem, that's not my problem.	Dat is syn probleem, dat is net myn probleem.
Very poor people have more time to read.	Hiel min minsken hawwe mear tiid om te lêzen.
I'm not sure they've ever been there.	Ik bin der net wis fan dat se der oait west hawwe.
She was really scared.	Se wie echt bang.
That was the reason why.	Dat wie de reden wêrom.
He's not here.	Hy is hjir net.
I knew it was true.	Ik wist dat it wier wie.
She did the same thing over and over again.	Se die itselde ding oer en wer.
There would have been no place for me.	Der soe gjin plak foar my west hawwe.
I wish I could do it as well as you.	Ik winskje dat ik it like goed koe dwaan as jo.
They have no money and are out of food.	Se hawwe gjin jild en binne út iten.
He asked the woman without name what had happened.	Hy frege de frou sûnder namme wat der bard wie.
But there could have been.	Mar der koe west hawwe.
But whatever the reason, there we were.	Mar wat de reden ek wie, dêr wiene wy.
So many things have happened in the last few days.	Der binne de lêste dagen safolle dingen bard.
To her father.	Oan har heit.
She had known for a long time that it would happen.	Se wist al lang dat it barre soe.
I will never see them again now.	Ik sil se no noait wer sjen.
His wife took everything away.	Syn frou naam alles fuort.
It was not even my idea.	It wie net iens myn idee.
Well, it was not.	No, it wie net.
I'm glad to be here.	Ik bin bliid hjir te wêzen.
He kept talking and talking.	Hy bleau praten en praten.
It had to be a woman.	It moast in frou wêze.
There are so many more!	Der binne safolle mear!
He can not see.	Hy kin net sjen.
And we are not alone.	En wy binne net allinnich.
I need to see you.	Ik moat dy sjen.
See what you can find.	Sjoch wat jo fine kinne.
Without us you would be nothing.	Sûnder ús wiene jo neat.
I asked for it.	Ik frege der om.
I want you to know for sure.	Ik wol dat jo dat wis witte.
It seemed to go on forever.	It like foar altyd troch te gean.
But that's hard to take.	Mar dat is dreech te nimmen.
That says a lot.	Dat seit in protte.
I wish it had not.	Ik woe graach dat it net hie.
But he says nothing.	Mar hy seit neat.
And being different is not wrong.	En oars wêze is net ferkeard.
There is no regret.	Der is gjin spyt.
She was ready to go at this time.	Se wie ree om te gean yn dizze tiid.
I just love this.	Ik hâld gewoan fan dizze.
There was no question, of course.	Der wie gjin fraach, fansels.
See what they do.	Sjoch wat se dogge.
She needs to know they are there.	Se moat witte dat se der binne.
But we're just friends.	Mar wy binne gewoan freonen.
Now that's gone.	No is dat fuort.
Whose idea was this?	Wa syn idee wie dit?
I can not say enough good things about her.	Ik kin net genôch goede dingen oer har sizze.
She has no problems.	Se hat gjin problemen.
It was not done well.	It waard net goed dien.
She knew what was waiting for her.	Se wist wat der op har wachte.
They just did not know it.	Se wisten it gewoan net.
The child asked for more.	It bern frege om mear.
It just does not happen.	It bart gewoan net.
His wife approached him and he looked at her.	Syn frou kaam op him ta en hy seach har oan.
The boy said not a word.	De jonge sei gjin wurd.
I can not look back.	Ik kin net werom sjen.
I really wanted to do it.	Ik woe it echt dwaan.
This is not entirely true.	Dit is net hielendal wier.
They are pretty happy.	Se binne aardich bliid.
There were many things she wanted to tell him.	Der wiene in protte dingen dy't se him fertelle woe.
That's her there.	Dat is har dêr.
We would do everything for you.	Wy soene alles foar jo dwaan.
His letter came too late.	Syn brief kaam te let.
Everything had been fine a few hours ago.	Alles wie in pear oeren lyn goed west.
Here, life was never easy.	Hjir wie it libben nea maklik.
If you had an idea.	As jo ​​​​in idee hiene.
But she had enough to say earlier.	Mar se hie earder genôch te sizzen.
There are more of those than ever before.	Der binne mear fan dy as ea earder.
I often only had a few hours to get things done.	Ik hie faak mar in pear oeren om dingen dien te krijen.
It does happen.	It bart wol.
We're doing it all right here.	Wy dogge it hjir allegear goed.
Tell him what you read if you like.	Fertel him wat jo hawwe lêzen as jo wolle.
I could do better.	Ik koe better.
This idea is not yours.	Dit idee is net fan jo.
That was not what really happened.	Dat wie net wat der echt barde.
You do both.	Jo dogge beide.
It was good to see him.	It wie goed om him te sjen.
How late was it, he asked.	Hoe let wie it, frege er.
He's not going there.	Hy mei dêr net hinne.
It's more than that.	It is mear as dat.
But do not worry.	Mar meitsje jo gjin soargen.
We were tired but happy.	Wy wiene wurch, mar bliid.
he wanted to know.	woe er witte.
That's hard to deal with.	Dat is dreech om te gean mei.
I received a letter from a friend.	Ik krige in brief fan in freon.
They had not seen her.	Se hiene har net sjoen.
I know exactly where it is.	Ik wit krekt wêr't it is.
No one else had said that.	Nimmen oars hie dat sein.
A few years, maybe more.	In pear jier, miskien mear.
None of you there knew who the person was.	Gjinien fan dy dêr wist wa't de persoan wie.
But it could not have been easy.	Mar it koe net maklik west hawwe.
Maybe he was really sick.	Miskien wie er echt siik.
It is clearly not.	It is dúdlik net.
She said no one was home.	Se sei dat der gjinien thús wie.
It would be like.	It soe wêze as.
Only my children stop me.	Allinnich myn bern hâldt my tsjin.
You can not just do both.	Jo kinne net gewoan beide dwaan.
This is an old problem.	Dit is in âld probleem.
Until it did one day.	Oant it op in dei die.
But she did not give up.	Mar se joech net op.
He just looked me up from his work.	Hy seach my gewoan op fan syn wurk.
He did not know the name either.	Hy koe de namme ek net.
Make it what you want it to be.	Meitsje der fan wat jo wolle.
Well, maybe we are.	No, miskien binne wy.
I'm better now.	Ik bin no better.
And you had him.	En jo hawwe him hân.
How was it before?	Hoe wie it earder?
She could not think why he wanted her.	Se koe net tinke wêrom't er har woe.
This can be done up to three times.	Dit kin oant trije kear dien wurde.
Then she would try everything.	Doe't se soe besykje alles.
He worked all day.	Hy wurke de hiele dei troch.
I can not stand it.	Ik kin it net oan.
He will eat.	Hy sil ite.
If not, wait another day.	As net, wachtsje in oare dei.
The car hit the animal.	De auto rekke it bist.
Everything looked good.	Alles seach der goed út.
We would not want that.	Dat soene wy ​​net wolle.
She was having problems, one way or another.	Se wie problemen, ien of oare manier.
She was not sure what to say.	Se wie net wis wat te sizzen.
I have only made two so far.	Ik haw oant no ta mar twa makke.
And she's better than good.	En se is better as goed.
I can not do much.	Ik kin net folle.
Maybe he does not like you.	Miskien docht er net as dy.
She looked over it and handed it back.	Se seach it oer en joech it werom.
I will do anything to make it right.	Ik sil alles dwaan om it goed te meitsjen.
We're having a party!	Wy meitsje in feest!
And let me know.	En lit my witte.
But look at everything that has happened.	Mar sjoch nei alles wat der bard is.
It was almost out.	It wie hast út.
I could only hope it was not from us.	Ik koe mar hoopje dat it net fan ús wie.
I feel good.	Ik fiel my goed.
They have also been afraid of us.	Se hawwe ek bang foar ús west.
He was always happy to help.	Hy wie altyd bliid om te helpen.
But this was my father.	Mar dit wie myn heit.
I hope you get better soon.	Ik hoopje dat jo gau better wurde.
Many people work from home today.	In protte minsken wurkje hjoed thús.
It was a blessing that she was there.	It wie in seine dat se der wie.
Then of course I'm there.	Dan bin ik der fansels.
Or what they are.	Of wat se binne.
Now it was more than one or two.	No wie it mear as ien of twa.
But we are not getting it ready.	Mar wy meitsje it net klear.
He had never touched it.	Hy hie it der noait oan hân.
Whatever it may be.	Wat dan ek wêze kin.
Easy and so fun to read.	Maklik en sa leuk om te lêzen.
He felt ready for anything.	Hy fielde him klear foar alles.
He could go in there if he wanted to.	Hy koe der yn, as er woe.
I just can 't go there right now.	Ik kin der no gewoan net hinne.
But never this.	Mar nea dit.
We're going for breakfast tomorrow.	Wy geane moarn foar moarn.
I'm talking about people.	Ik haw it oer minsken.
I would love to talk to you.	Ik soe graach mei dy prate wolle.
But even those are still waiting.	Mar ek dy wachtsje noch.
But let's be real.	Mar litte wy echt wurde.
The food for one.	It iten foar ien.
That's right, one more.	Dat is krekt, noch ien.
And there was a lot of it.	En der wie in protte fan.
Everyone heard.	Elkenien hearde.
It would be good now.	It soe no goed wêze.
I'm his mother.	Ik bin syn mem.
I will be there anyway.	Ik sil der wol wêze.
I need to see him.	Ik moat him sjen.
Better not to have children.	Better gjin bern te hawwen.
They were no longer there.	Se wiene der net mear.
He did not hit him well.	Hy rekke him net goed.
It's me for her.	It is my foar har.
She just did not find her friends enough.	Se fûn har freonen gewoan net genôch.
I had to be with friends.	Ik moast by freonen wêze.
Well, you're ready.	No, jo binne klear.
Many continue to be.	In protte bliuwe te wêzen.
We did not know what to do.	Wy wisten net wat te dwaan.
This is my life, this is it.	Dit is myn libben, dit is it.
Everything else did.	Al it oare die.
He was very good at it too.	Hy wie der ek tige goed yn.
But do not like it.	Mar hâld der net fan.
Tell your father.	Fertel dyn heit.
It must be beautiful.	It moat moai wêze.
Dad came in late and found me there.	Heit kaam der let yn en fûn my dêr.
It will be here.	It sil hjir wêze.
And that's not easy.	En dat is net maklik.
It gave me away.	It joech my fuort.
Do not tell them exactly what they are doing wrong.	Fertel har net krekt hokker se ferkeard hawwe.
And if it is not, you will know it.	En as it net is, sille jo it witte.
They want to see what will happen.	Se wolle sjen wat der barre sil.
We'll go this the right way.	Wy sille dit op 'e goede manier gean.
All very well.	Allegear hiel goed.
Maybe it will not happen again.	Miskien sil it net wer barre.
And you will need it.	En jo sille it nedich hawwe.
He was not even my father.	Hy wie net iens myn heit.
My question to you is this.	Myn fraach oan dy is dit.
I really like the movie.	Ik hâld echt fan 'e film.
Go out of school.	Gean út skoalle.
But it probably is not.	Mar it is wierskynlik net.
Go away without looking at anyone.	Gean fuort sûnder nei ien te sjen.
Today you are just.	Hjoed binne jo gewoan.
I was looking forward to him holding me.	Ik seach der nei út om him te hâlden my.
It was a long time ago.	It wie lang lyn.
I thought she was talking about me, but she was not.	Ik tocht dat se it oer my hie, mar dat wie se net.
We will be ready for him.	Wy sille foar him klear wêze.
See the book and you want to see the work.	Sjoch it boek en jo wolle it wurk sjen.
Not so much of it.	Net safolle fan it.
Do not see it then.	Sjoch it dan net.
But he is not so busy.	Mar hy hat it net sa drok.
I hope people like it.	Ik hoopje dat minsken it leuk fine.
I'm sure she's going to do well.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se it goed sil dwaan.
I have a few for him.	Ik haw in pear foar him.
From all your friends.	Fan al dyn freonen.
The film is coming out next week.	De film komt nije wike út.
He walked to school every day.	Hy rûn alle dagen nei skoalle.
Everything would be fine.	Alles soe goed komme.
But I feel so much better.	Mar ik fiel my safolle better.
We do not have them.	Dy hawwe wy net.
She does it often.	Se docht it faak.
And this would be true.	En dit soe wier wêze.
Lots of problems.	In protte problemen.
You have to wait and see.	Jo moatte wachtsje en sjen.
He was glad he could help.	Hy wie bliid dat er helpe koe.
He has never been on time.	Hy hat nea op tiid west.
I agree with him.	Ik bin it mei him iens.
We need to take care of each other.	Wy moatte foar elkoar soargje.
Once they were.	Ien kear wiene se.
We want to do what we want.	Wy wolle dwaan wat wy wolle.
I can not have you around me now.	Ik kin dy no net om my ha.
It was nothing like that.	It wie neat as dat.
But maybe better for the book.	Mar miskien better foar it boek.
Well, he showed his dad nicely this year.	No, hy liet syn heit dit jier moai sjen.
I'm very happy with how it has turned out.	Ik bin heul bliid mei hoe't it is wurden.
He will do that.	Hy sil dat dwaan.
I never had it.	Ik hie it noait.
If you do not go, do so now.	As jo ​​​​net gean, doch dat no.
The plan will not work at all.	It plan sil hielendal net wurkje.
I'm sure it does.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it docht.
You have to wait.	Jo moatte wachtsje.
He had a job.	Hy hie in wurk hân.
He does not have you.	Hy hat dy net.
He probably did not come.	Hy kaam wierskynlik net.
You'll get mine.	Jo sille myn krije.
We think it should.	Wy tinke dat it moat.
If so, take it up.	As dat sa is, nim it op.
I should have done it.	Ik hie it dwaan moatten.
He now knew he wanted something more.	Hy wist no dat er wat mear woe.
And she will do what you ask.	En se sil dwaan wat jo freegje.
She will not be now.	Se sil no net wêze.
By de by.	By de by.
But there was hope.	Mar der wie hope.
Let him out, let him out!	Lit him út, lit him út!
The bed is very well made.	It bêd is hiel goed makke.
You did it very well.	Jo hawwe it hiel goed dien.
I'm giving up.	Ik jou op.
There are too many.	Der binne te folle.
We do not need one.	Wy hawwe net ien nedich.
Also of not knowing.	Ek fan net witte.
Of course they were not.	Dat wiene se fansels net.
Talk a little.	Praat in bytsje.
Said it was too much.	Sei it wie te folle.
I would love to talk to you if you can.	Ik soe graach mei jo prate as jo kinne.
There was something different this time.	Der wie dizze kear wat oars.
It works well now.	It wurket no goed.
Another time.	In oare kear.
Why is it necessary for me to do this?	Wêrom is it nedich foar my om dit te dwaan?
But it seems good to me.	Mar it liket my goed.
We make them sick.	Wy meitsje se siik.
Today that is not true.	Hjoed is dat net wier.
I think you should think about this.	Ik tink dat jo dit oer tinke moatte.
That's not why we're here.	Dat is net wêrom wy hjir binne.
I could do nothing.	Ik koe neat dwaan.
And he asked.	En hy frege.
And that's it.	En dat is dat.
They need to get something from someone.	Se moatte wat fan immen krije.
You never know with a dog.	Jo witte noait mei in hûn.
He had not seen her.	Hy hie har net sjoen.
I felt really bad.	Ik fielde my echt min.
I asked that myself.	Dat haw ik sels frege.
None of it can hurt you now.	Gjin fan it kin jo no sear dwaan.
For us, it was different.	Foar ús wie it oars.
Or tomorrow.	Of moarn.
I do not know what it's about.	Ik wit net wêr't it oer giet.
We have to go back.	Wy moatte werom.
Her mother bought it.	Har mem kocht it.
And happy about it.	En der bliid om.
Not sure which one.	Net wis hokker.
Please come with us.	Kom asjebleaft mei ús.
She might not even have a house if that happened.	Se soe miskien net iens in hûs hawwe as dat barde.
I'm in a bad way.	Ik bin yn in minne manier.
We got nothing.	Wy krigen neat.
We will now think of it as one thing.	Wy sille it no as ien ding tinke.
He almost liked her.	Hy mocht har hast wol.
Life is too busy today.	It libben is hjoed te drok.
I do not see you much every day.	Ik sjoch dy net alle dagen in protte.
No one came with them.	Gjinien kaam mei har oan.
I did not want anything to do with it.	Ik woe der neat mei ha.
But neither is he.	Mar dat is hy ek net.
Is it still in place?	Is it noch yn plak?
But that did not make him wrong.	Mar dat makke him net ferkeard.
But he knew that.	Mar dat wist er wol.
Which there was not.	Wat der net wie.
He looks nice on her.	Hy liket aardich op har.
I went through it myself.	Ik gie der sels troch.
.	.
A guy who does not.	In keardel dy't net docht.
Tell her nothing.	Fertel har neat.
But they did, of course.	Mar dat diene se fansels.
Just take it.	Nim it gewoan.
That makes it difficult.	Dat makket it dreech.
We just saw.	Wy ha krekt sjoen.
Do not touch me.	Meitsje my net oan.
Now that seems in question.	No liket dat yn fraach.
Those were his words.	Dat wiene syn wurden.
They were working on it.	Se wiene der oan wurke.
She was the first girl in his class.	Se wie it earste famke yn syn klasse.
This did not work for me.	Dit wurke net foar my.
I actually do not know much about him.	Ik wit eins net safolle oer him.
He could not do this for long.	Hy koe dit net lang mear.
I was just his wife before.	Ik wie gewoan syn frou earder.
I show.	Ik lit sjen.
They never said anything to me about it.	Se hawwe der noait wat tsjin my oer sein.
You have to work with everyone.	Jo moatte mei elkenien wurkje.
That's a good way to look at it.	Dat is in goede manier om it te sjen.
See, they do not open.	Sjoch, se geane net iepen.
And on the first trip, no one did.	En op de earste tocht wie der gjinien dy't dat die.
He had to get in there again.	Hy moast der wer yn.
But we have no time now.	Mar wy hawwe no gjin tiid.
These are.	Dit binne.
He knew no more.	Hy wist net mear.
I should go.	Ik soe gean moatte.
He knows we're here.	Hy wit dat wy hjir binne.
She just had to be in a place where you had been.	Se moast gewoan op in plak wêze wêr't jo west hiene.
That was the big thing for us this week.	Dat wie it grutte ding foar ús dizze wike.
Could not tell him.	Koe it him net fertelle.
Here are two people.	Hjir binne twa minsken.
You had done it.	Jo hiene it dien.
We need your help to continue this work.	Wy hawwe jo help nedich om dit wurk troch te gean.
And he had been very kind to her children.	En hy hie tige aardich west foar har bern.
And no children.	En gjin bern.
He could do better.	Hy koe better.
It was the best she had to go.	It wie it bêste dat se gean moast.
And what someone needs.	En wat immen nedich hat.
You must have done a lot of work to make this happen.	Jo moatte in protte wurk makke hawwe om dit te meitsjen.
To my office but did nothing.	Oan myn kantoar, mar die neat.
Be a man about it.	Wês der in man oer.
As if it does not agree.	As is it der net iens.
I was always in trouble.	Ik wie altyd yn de problemen.
But it's too late.	Mar it is te let.
He could wait.	Hy koe wachtsje.
You get what you ask for.	Jo krije wat jo freegje.
I tried the first one.	Ik besocht de earste.
They even go off.	Se geane sels ôf.
I ask her why she does this.	Ik freegje har wêrom't se dit docht.
Not for money.	Net foar jild.
There is a better way.	Der is in bettere manier.
I did not want this.	Ik woe dit net.
She would have said my name.	Se soe myn namme sein hawwe.
That's the last time we've really talked.	Dat is de lêste kear dat wy echt praat hawwe.
You've seen it before.	Jo hawwe it earder sjoen.
Come into the other room.	Kom yn 'e oare keamer.
He does not like me.	Hy hâldt net fan my.
For the first year.	Foar it earste jier.
But there are still some problems.	Mar der binne noch wat problemen.
The photo was not difficult to take.	De foto wie net dreech om te nimmen.
I love those things too.	Ik hâld fan dy dingen ek.
My kids love going there.	Myn bern geane der graach hinne.
Still love him.	Hâld noch fan him.
I felt myself again.	Ik fielde my wer.
You make your bed, you have to eat it.	Jo meitsje jo bêd op, jo moatte it ite.
She has been wearing her hair for a long time.	Se hat har hier lang oan.
They should not have.	Se moatte net hawwe.
Clearly he did not.	Dúdlik hie er net.
Not by him.	Net troch him.
I never knew anything.	Ik wist noait wat.
I love the people here.	Ik hâld fan de minsken hjir.
Keep that up, too.	Hâld dat ek.
He knew something was wrong with me.	Hy wist dat der wat net mei my wie.
I do not know how to deal with it.	Ik wit net hoe ik der mei oan moat.
But you do not have to stay if you do not want to.	Mar jo hoege net te bliuwen as jo net wolle.
There was no one she wanted to talk to.	Der wie gjinien mei wa se prate woe.
The child for you is still going.	It bern foar dy giet noch.
We get through it.	Wy komme der troch.
You will know it.	Jo sille it witte.
He said it was good.	Hy sei dat it goed wie.
Even my father.	Sels myn heit.
Everything was fine.	Alles wie goed.
All that money.	Al dat jild.
I think it is necessary too.	Ik tink dat it ek nedich is.
I could not even see it.	Ik koe it net iens sjen.
Ready, one, two three.	Klear, ien, twa trije.
He said he did not even know why.	Hy sei dat er net iens wist wêrom.
My kids work very hard.	Myn bern wurket heul hurd.
I did nothing wrong.	Ik haw neat ferkeard dien.
In or out.	Yn of út.
If there were not, there would not be much hope.	As der net wiene, soe der net folle hope wêze.
Me, that's good, well done.	Ek, dat is goed, goed dien.
This teacher wants to ask for one thing.	Dizze learaar frege wol om ien ding.
I had been here before.	Ik hie hjir earder west.
It was just everything.	It wie gewoan alles.
She had told me that herself.	Dat hie se my sels ferteld.
We needed the money.	Wy hiene it jild nedich.
It comes in front of the room	It komt foar de keamer
I'll tell you when.	Ik sil dy fertelle wannear.
I can no longer stand this.	Ik kin dit net mear oan.
Has one of us.	Hat ien fan ús.
So let's do this now.	Dat litte wy dit no dwaan.
She should have asked, she knew.	Se soe freegje moatte, se wist it.
He walked over to her.	Hy rûn nei har ta.
It was no better when he got home.	It wie net better doe't er thús kaam.
I asked another teacher.	Ik haw in oare learaar frege.
Doing a job for you.	It dwaan fan in baan foar dy.
You get what you get.	Jo krije wat jo krije.
It was pretty beautiful.	It wie moai moai.
Maybe there was something he could find.	Miskien wie der wat dat er fine koe.
That is still interested in this kind of work.	Dat is noch altyd ynteressearre yn dit soarte fan wurk.
It's fun work.	It is leuk wurk.
You want her to know how much you love her.	Jo wolle dat se wit hoefolle jo fan har hâlde.
It's easy.	Dit is maklik.
I wanted to work with you.	Ik woe mei dy wurkje.
My parents have met her and they find her a lot.	Myn âlden hawwe har moete en se fine har in protte.
She had no water.	Se hie gjin wetter.
I saw someone.	Ik seach immen.
It just happens.	It bart gewoan.
she asked.	frege se har ôf.
What kind of food do you like?	Wat foar iten hâlde jo fan?
It makes me happy to see her happy.	It makket my bliid om har bliid te sjen.
Had obviously not thought it worked.	Hie fansels net tocht dat it wurke.
Be good now.	Wês no goed.
Maybe that was just as good.	Miskien wie dat like goed.
Nobody wants anything.	Nimmen wol wat.
He's here for a reason.	Hy is hjir foar in reden.
Let me know who my friends were and who were not.	Lit my witte wa't myn freonen wiene en wa net.
They know you can be wrong.	Se witte dat jo ferkeard kinne wêze.
You can not worry about me.	Jo kinne gjin soargen oer my.
She could see the good it could do for me.	Se koe sjen it goede it koe dwaan foar my.
The couple has two children.	It pear hat twa bern.
His hair is also very different.	Syn hier is ek hiel oars.
It may not be good words.	It kin wêze gjin goede wurden.
It's just how much they'll give.	It is krekt hoefolle se sille jaan.
They did nothing.	Se diene neat.
And we must want to keep them.	En wy moatte har hâlde wolle.
I'll get there.	Ik sil der komme.
Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh!	Praten as wiene se der net iens.
His family had one.	Syn famylje hie ien.
But we did.	Mar wy diene.
I just did not know how to do this.	Ik wist gewoan net hoe dit te dwaan.
Not you.	Net dy.
Someone had to tell the truth about what happened.	Immen moast de wierheid fertelle oer wat der barde.
I died over seeing the latter.	Ik stoar oer it sjen fan de lêste.
He says so much.	Hy seit safolle.
That makes her children.	Dat makket har bern.
I could not believe the size of the house.	Ik koe de grutte fan it hûs net leauwe.
Mine has hurt you.	Myn hat dy sear dien.
Real and feel real.	Echt en fiel echt.
Things were a little different today, of course.	Dingen wiene hjoed wat oars, fansels.
This was still happening.	Dit barde noch.
A nice, old man.	In aardich, âld man.
I knew it would never work.	Ik wist dat it soe nea wurkje.
Not much more.	Net folle mear.
We can win again.	Wy kinne wer winne.
Sure, he might like to be needed.	Wis, hy mocht graach nedich wêze.
It would never do.	It soe nea dwaan.
I have you.	Ik haw dy.
That was not all.	Dat wie net alles.
I seem to have a lot to say.	Ik lykje in protte te sizzen te hawwen.
I can not wait to be free.	Ik kin net wachtsje om frij te wêzen.
You had to talk to my parents.	Do moast mei myn âlden prate.
To do that, you need to know who that is.	Om dat te dwaan, moatte jo witte wa't dat is.
Everything was not right.	Alles wie net goed.
He could not believe he heard this.	Hy koe net leauwe dat er dit hearde.
I was never like that before.	Ik wie nea earder sa.
That is decided forever.	Dat is foar altyd besletten.
I don 't think she's ever loved me.	Ik tink net dat se oait fan my hâlde.
But there is a problem with that.	Mar dêr is in probleem mei.
But he was not.	Mar hy wie net.
It was long, but not long enough.	It wie lang, mar net lang genôch.
I leave it to you.	Ik lit it oan dy oer.
We just like to be told what to do.	Wy gewoan graach wurde ferteld wat te dwaan.
We never knew.	Wy wisten it noait.
If the kids did it from home, then you have them.	As de bern it fan hûs diene, dan hawwe jo se.
I thought this way would work.	Ik tocht dat dizze manier soe wurkje.
If not, you can try one now.	As net, kinne jo no ien besykje.
This will not be more than once or twice a month.	Dit sil net mear as ien of twa kear yn 'e moanne wêze.
But that was not it.	Mar dat wie it net.
A photo this week.	In foto dizze wike.
So he knew what was happening.	Sa wist hy wat der barde.
They were good.	Se wiene goed.
But they did.	Mar dat diene se.
I see it in him.	Ik sjoch it yn him.
He did not find it.	Hy fûn it net.
And now, so was she.	En no, sa wie se.
He had hurt her children too.	Hy hie har bern ek sear dien.
You are not good.	Jo binne net goed.
He is the one who told them about us.	Hy is dejinge dy't har oer ús fertelde.
And make some money.	En meitsje wat jild.
You are free to disagree with the teacher.	Jo binne frij om it net iens te wêzen mei de learaar.
A person may not be what he wants.	In persoan kin net wêze wat hy wol.
It was nice to have someone for me.	It wie moai dat der ien foar my wie.
That, of course, is what is happening here.	Dat is fansels wat hjir bart.
No one even knows about the man.	Nimmen wit sels oer de man.
But something else.	Mar wat oars.
You did not know it.	Jo wisten it net.
Things were just.	Dingen wiene gewoan.
His life had not gone well.	Syn libben wie net goed gien.
You may know it.	Jo kinne it witte.
She's just a child.	Se is mar in bern.
It was not her place.	It wie net har plak.
I assume you would love to have it back.	Ik nim oan dat jo it graach werom ha wolle.
Look at me.	Sjoch nei my.
To stay.	Bliuwe.
He walked home.	Hy rûn nei hûs.
He came to me.	Hy kaam nei my ta.
How many of us are over there?	Hoefolle fan ús binne der oer?
I want to see you.	Ik wol dy wol sjen.
I told her earlier.	Ik fertelde har earder.
We would have been happy.	Wy soene bliid west hawwe.
If so, he obviously did not know her well.	As dat sa wie, koe er har fansels net goed.
Neither here nor there.	Noch hjir noch dêr.
You have a lot of questions, right?	Jo hawwe in protte fragen, net?
Your children can stay and live in.	Jo bern kinne bliuwe en wenje yn.
That's the only time.	Dat is de ienige kear.
He did not want to tell anyone.	Hy woe it net oan ien fertelle.
I thought there was something.	Ik tocht dat der wat wie.
And never talk to her again.	En nea wer mei har prate.
A little round.	In bytsje rûn.
One went out yesterday.	Ien gie juster út.
Maybe once or twice, then it will come in handy.	Miskien ien of twa kear, dan komt it wol goed.
What was is still is.	Wat wie, is noch altyd.
I was asked to.	Ik wie frege om.
We know where they get it from.	Wy witte wêr't se it wei krije.
I've never been here before.	Ik ha hjir noch nea west.
I do not like it.	It liket my net.
And it says you're still here.	En it seit dat jo hjir noch binne.
He could not think why he wanted to talk to her.	Hy koe net tinke wêrom't er mei har prate woe.
She knew the way out of this place.	Se wist de wei út dit plak.
They can not have both.	Se kinne net beide hawwe.
I can not tell you how we met.	Ik kin net fertelle hoe't wy moete.
It's the only way in.	It is de ienige manier yn.
I want him to really think about my question.	Ik wol dat hy echt tinkt oer myn fraach.
You just have to be yourself.	Jo moatte gewoan jo wêze.
She assumed it was my friend's car.	Se naam oan dat de auto fan myn freon wie.
We like this man very much.	Wy wolle dizze man tige min.
The money does not matter to him.	It jild makket him neat út.
Has been the last few days.	Hat west de lêste pear dagen.
Which is too little.	Wat te min is.
The whole city heard that.	De hiele stêd hearde dat.
At the time, she had not said much.	Yn dy tiid hie se net folle sein.
I wanted to say more.	Ik woe mear sizze.
If she was, she would have done more for me.	As se wie, soe se my mear dien hawwe.
She can not stand it.	Se kin it net oan.
You obviously cannot do this.	Jo kinne dit fansels net dwaan.
This would hurt.	Dit soe sear dwaan.
He had done it before.	Hy hie it earder dien.
Maybe we.	Miskien wy.
He would like to return home.	Hy wol graach werom nei hûs.
I'm not sure how to do that.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe te dwaan dat.
There was only one person it could be.	Der wie mar ien persoan it koe wêze.
I have never met this person in my life.	Ik haw dizze persoan yn myn libben noch noait moete.
She could not say why, but it was too late.	Se koe net sizze wêrom, mar it wie te let.
She left me the letter.	Se liet my de brief.
That's not it.	Dat is it net.
And we would keep them on the plan.	En wy soene har op it plan hâlde.
Or even a month.	Of sels in moanne.
He never came.	Hy kaam noait.
Then you have come to the right place.	Dan binne jo op it goede plak kommen.
She touched her hair.	Se rekke har hier oan.
You have the right idea.	Jo hawwe it goede idee.
And he knew it had not gone well.	En hy wist dat it net goed gien wie.
You know you love it.	Jo witte dat jo der fan hâlde.
But there was nothing to do about it now.	Mar dêr wie no neat oan te dwaan.
And ask questions.	En freegje fragen.
Let's not talk about it again.	Lit ús der net wer oer prate.
I can help.	Ik kin helpe.
Did he create problems for you?	Hat er problemen foar jo makke?
You're better at it than I am.	Do bist der better yn as ik.
They will say, your father.	Se sille sizze, dyn heit.
I did not think much of it.	Ik tocht der net folle oan.
He should leave it there.	Hy soe it dêr litte moatte.
You can talk to the police.	Jo kinne prate mei de plysje.
Do not worry about anything.	Meitsje jo gjin soargen oer neat.
What he had in mind was something else.	Wat er yn gedachten hie, wie wat oars.
I'm so scared.	Ik bin sa bang.
My friend was a great help.	Myn freon wie in grutte help.
If it works for you, it works for you.	As it foar jo wurket, wurket it foar.
I'm not too scared.	Ik bin net al te bang.
Well say.	Wol sizze.
It could have been different, and he would have been different then.	It koe oars, en hy hie dan ek oars west.
I'm telling the truth.	Ik fertel de wierheid.
It's not going well.	It giet net goed.
It would be nice if it did, but it just does not.	It soe moai wêze as it die, mar it docht gewoan net.
So, there it was, out in the open.	Sa, dêr wie it, út yn 'e iepen.
I hope the book gets better.	Ik hoopje dat it boek better wurdt.
But he wanted more than that.	Mar hy woe mear as dat.
We can not find it.	Wy kinne it net fine.
Nobody knew we had been there.	Nimmen wist dat wy der west hiene.
First take the time to see how much she eats.	Nim earst de tiid om te sjen hoefolle se yt.
Often a new city would be created.	Faak soe in nije stêd makke wurde.
My mother was in there.	Myn mem wie der yn.
Think about how long it has been.	Tink oan hoe lang it is west.
Nothing happened.	Der barde neat.
I still remember hearing that before.	Ik wit noch dat ik dat earder heard hie.
That's the good thing.	Dat is it goede ding.
Who told you to get in here?	Wa hat dy sein datst hjir yn komme koe?
It's so easy !.	It is sa maklik!.
Not everything is good.	Net alles is goed.
Maybe someone told her.	Miskien hat immen har ferteld.
I really wanted nothing more.	Ik woe eins neat mear.
He was sure he would not be seen.	Hy wie der wis fan dat hy net sjoen wurde soe.
He's coming too.	Hy komt ek.
They will see you for what you are.	Se sille jo sjen foar wat jo binne.
Get out of this city.	Gean út dizze stêd.
It was just mine.	It wie gewoan myn.
I can not do everything today or even this week.	Ik kin net alles dwaan hjoed of sels dizze wike.
Let him come.	Lit him komme.
Everything is nothing.	Alles is neat.
My friends do not have to worry.	Myn freonen hoege gjin soargen te hawwen.
One more day, that was all he needed.	Noch ien dei, dat wie alles wat er nedich hie.
It was open.	It wie iepen.
He has decided for you, and for me.	Hy hat besletten foar jo, en foar my.
I'm not trying to keep up this time.	Ik besykje net iens te hâlden dizze kear.
He carefully made a plan.	Hy makke foarsichtich in plan.
He loves us.	Hy hâldt fan ús.
It was on its own.	It wie op himsels.
It's easy to talk like that.	It is maklik om sa te praten.
I found that a week ago.	Dat fûn ik in wike lyn.
There is so much to get.	Der is mar safolle fan te krijen.
If he goes, we go.	As hy giet, geane wy.
We have done the work for you.	Wy hawwe it wurk foar jo dien.
We take off day after day.	Wy nimme ôf dei nei.
Money can buy anything.	Jild kin alles keapje.
He did not talk to her.	Hy prate net mei har.
Do you want to do this today?	Wolle jo dit hjoed dwaan.
Please come someone.	Kom asjebleaft immen.
What goes in goes out one way or another.	Wat der yn giet, giet op ien of oare manier út.
It was only once.	It wie mar ien kear.
I'm his friend.	Ik bin syn freon.
The woman is not either.	De frou is ek net.
Still will not talk to me.	Noch altyd sil net mei my prate.
I would say the same thing about you.	Ik soe itselde ding oer dy sizze.
Do not worry too much about it.	Meitsje jo der net te folle soargen oer.
Not in a bad way.	Net op in minne manier.
Things you need to know.	Dingen dy't jo witte moatte.
It does not make those people bad or good.	It makket dy minsken net min of goed.
Very happy to be back.	Hiel bliid om werom te wêzen.
About me, he said.	Oer my, sei er.
It will only happen more.	It sil allinnich mar mear barre.
Something will happen to you and your car.	Der sil wat barre mei jo en jo auto.
Let it come to you.	Lit it nei dy komme.
I should win.	Ik soe winne moatte.
I did not feel that way.	Ik fielde my net sa.
They have not found them yet.	Se hawwe se noch net fûn.
That will take time.	Dat sil tiid nimme.
Do you want to.	Wolle jo.
Feel that now.	Fiel dat no.
Had no problems.	Hie gjin problemen.
That was not allowed.	Dat mocht net.
Police say they believe it will go well.	De plysje seit dat se leauwe dat it goed komt.
I believe it will work.	Ik leau dat it sil wurkje.
I will let you know if there are any problems.	Ik sil jo litte witte as d'r problemen binne.
But it was not about him.	Mar it gie net oer him.
I gave it to my husband.	Ik joech it oan myn man.
But so far there has been no chance at all.	Mar oant no ta wie der hielendal gjin kâns.
After the party.	Nei it feest.
But this was even too much for him.	Mar dit wie sels foar him te folle.
I want to talk about something else.	Ik wol it oer wat oars.
He was free at home.	Hy wie thús frij.
Well, he is and he is just.	No, hy is en hy is net.
We could do it ourselves.	Wy koene dit sels dwaan.
A week, she thought, or maybe two.	In wike, tocht se, of miskien wol twa.
We had found our new home.	Wy hiene ús nije thús fûn.
I think he is one of the best.	Ik tink dat hy is ien fan de bêste.
There is no one else, nothing else.	Der is gjinien oars, neat oars.
That is what is so difficult.	Dat is wat sa dreech is.
In a few years, that will be me.	Oer in pear jier sil dat my wêze.
I can and will.	Ik kin en wol.
But that's not what it says.	Mar dat is net wat it seit.
He looked at me.	Hy seach my oan.
I'm very careful.	Ik bin hiel foarsichtich.
Just happy, happy, happy.	Krekt bliid, bliid, bliid.
We do something else.	Wy dogge wat oars.
But he did not look at her.	Mar hy seach har net oan.
This is what my mother does.	Dit docht myn mem.
And it was not hard to find.	En it wie net dreech te finen.
And he will not do it.	En hy sil it net dwaan.
He must take her and go quickly.	Hy moat har nimme en gau gean.
Children should love their parents.	Bern moatte fan har âlden hâlde.
I even have two best friends.	Ik haw sels twa bêste freonen.
This should not happen.	Dit mocht net barre.
I do not know how to deal with it.	Ik wit net hoe ik it oan moat.
They were long.	Se wiene lang.
These were the best they ever made.	Dit wiene de bêste se ea makke.
I know it better than you.	Ik kin it better as jo.
It says a lot.	It seit in protte.
They could see him.	Se koene him sjen.
She was the only one he found again.	Se wie de ienige dy't er wer fûn.
That my father scared him.	Dat myn heit him bang makke.
She soon realized that it could not.	Se realisearre al gau dat it net kin.
For his help.	Foar syn help.
Feel free to.	Fiel dy frij om.
Do you agree with me ?.	Bist it mei my iens?.
He had been as good as sick all his life.	Hy wie syn hiele libben sa goed as siik west.
I'm actually trying to do the same.	Ik besykje eins itselde te dwaan.
The boy was fine.	De jonge hie it goed.
All not to look at him.	Alles om net nei him te sjen.
He could show it to her.	Hy koe it har sjen litte.
But this time it did not happen.	Mar dizze kear barde it net.
I ate my food.	Ik iet myn iten.
Did not do the same.	Hat itselde net dien.
You can find it here.	Jo kinne it hjir fine.
That's the best.	Dat is it bêste.
I can see no reason why anyone would do this.	Ik kin gjin reden sjen wêrom't immen dit soe dwaan.
Right there.	Krekt dêr.
For more than one reason, too.	Om mear as ien reden, te.
I'll try that.	Ik sil dat besykje.
Nobody really wants to do that.	Nimmen wol dat eins dwaan.
I got no money, no place to go.	Ik krige gjin jild, gjin plak om te gean.
Until there is nothing left.	Oant der neat mear oer is.
But that is not enough for us.	Mar dat is net genôch foar ús.
Which is also a very, very good thing.	Wat ek in hiel, hiel goed ding is.
We know it's not real, but that does not matter anymore.	Wy witte dat it net echt is, mar dat hoecht net mear.
He knew problems when he saw it.	Hy wist problemen doe't er it seach.
It's not difficult.	It is net dreech.
See for yourself.	Sjoch sels mar.
I was sick for three days.	Ik wie trije dagen siik.
That's enough for now.	Dat is foar no genôch.
Which is good.	Wat goed is.
No way around that.	Gjin manier om dat hinne.
The other.	Dy oare.
About many things.	Oer in protte dingen.
And many children like to do it too.	En in protte bern dogge it ek graach.
You may have just made a few friends here.	Jo kinne hjir gewoan in pear freonen makke hawwe.
She did it.	Se die it.
You must eat food first.	Jo moatte earst iten ite.
We are here to give it back to you.	Wy binne hjir om it oan jo werom te jaan.
I'm not one of those people.	Ik bin net ien fan dy minsken.
Of course it did.	Fansels die it.
It is necessary.	It is nedich.
Why is this happening to us?	Wêrom bart dit mei ús?
Someone must.	Immen moat.
And he knows it was wrong, too.	En hy wit dat it ek ferkeard wie.
It just is not and you know why.	It is gewoan net en jo witte wêrom.
I still remember him to this day.	Ik tink noch oan him oant hjoed de dei.
Maybe he was just himself.	Miskien wie er gewoan himsels.
You need both.	Jo hawwe it beide nedich.
Two.	Twa.
I did not even know you had a car.	Ik wist net iens dat jo in auto hiene.
He liked this room.	Hy mocht dizze keamer.
Nobody liked it.	Nimmen mocht it leuk fine.
He just can not.	Hy kin gewoan net.
But it's still early.	Mar it is noch betiid.
You do not have them.	Jo hawwe se net.
This makes them money.	Dit makket se jild.
There was not much time left for us.	Der wie net folle tiid mear foar ús.
This is how it is now.	Dit is hoe't it no is.
It was true, just like life.	It wie wier, krekt as it libben.
They know it.	Se witte it.
There were three issues with this.	Der wiene trije problemen mei dizze.
Everyone needs to know this.	Elkenien moat dit witte.
He wanted me to look at him.	Hy woe dat ik nei him seach.
Good to have them back.	Goed om se werom te hawwen.
You need more.	Jo moatte mear.
He really did not want to be here.	Hy woe hjir eins net wêze.
You found it.	Jo hawwe it fûn.
I ask everything now.	Ik freegje alles no.
See, whether you like it or not.	Sjoch, wolle jo it of net.
I'm coming back now.	Ik kom no werom.
I met her in a room.	Ik moete har yn in keamer.
If that matters.	As dat der ta docht.
Never quite for it.	Nea hielendal foar it.
Min, very min.	Min, tige min.
He, of course, will never look like himself.	Hy sil fansels noait op himsels lykje.
This was him a year ago.	Dit wie him in jier lyn.
Thing is in the room with us.	Ding is yn 'e keamer by ús.
Think of two years ago.	Tink oan twa jier lyn.
It must be hard though.	It moat wol hurd wêze.
All the people here are like that.	Alle minsken hjir binne sa.
I try not to read too much into it.	Ik besykje dêr net te folle yn te lêzen.
And play well.	En spylje goed.
I think he's the only one.	Ik tink dat hy de ienige is.
Of course Why not.	Fansels Wêrom net.
But there is one problem.	Mar d'r is ien probleem.
We have food to eat.	Wy hawwe iten te iten.
I have worked hard on this.	Ik haw hurd wurke oan dizze.
It might be something for next year.	It is miskien wat foar takom jier.
It looks at me now.	It sjocht my no oan.
But she said there was not enough work to go around.	Mar se sei dat d'r net genôch wurk wie om rûn te gean.
Nobody sees anymore.	Nimmen sjocht mear.
I'll get through it.	Ik kom der wol troch.
This child got a mother.	Dit bern krige in mem.
We have it all.	Wy hawwe dat allegear.
He may be one of the first one or two out.	Hy kin ien fan 'e earste ien of twa út wêze.
They would go home together.	Se soene tegearre nei hûs ta.
I can't.	Ik kin net.
But if all went well.	Mar as alles goed gie.
But you can see it.	Mar jo kinne it sjen.
Probably the latter.	Wierskynlik dat lêste.
That never happened before.	Dat barde eartiids noait.
When is the best time to do this?	Wannear is de bêste tiid om dit te dwaan?
There were just so many people.	Der wiene krekt safolle minsken.
Everyone this is the best man.	Elkenien dit is de bêste man.
Let's just say we did not make it.	Litte wy mar sizze dat wy it net makke hawwe.
', used to be'.	', wie'.
Let them try new things.	Lit se besykje nije dingen.
It's almost there now.	It is der no hast.
Whatever she was planning, he did not know.	Wat se ek fan plan wie, hy wist der net fan.
She would not even look at me at school yet.	Se soe noch net iens nei my op skoalle sjen.
It has never been done before.	It is noch noait earder dien.
We are great friends.	Wy binne grutte freonen.
She went through it again.	Se gie der wer troch.
One surefire way to find out.	Ien wis manier om út te finen.
She does not deal with the truth.	Se docht net mei de wierheid.
The problem is the size.	It probleem is de grutte.
Really good book.	Echt goed boek.
Not a bad kind.	Net in minne soarte.
It just makes me like that.	It makket my gewoan sa.
There will be no problems.	Der sille gjin problemen wêze.
He may be back now.	Hy kin no werom wêze.
She could no longer.	Se koe net mear.
It looked like he wanted to tell us something.	It like derop dat er ús wat fertelle woe.
Go into them.	Gean yn har.
He needs us, and we do nothing to get him back.	Hy hat ús nedich, en wy dogge neat om him werom te krijen.
He can do nothing now.	Hy kin no neat dwaan.
They actually had more money in here.	Se hiene hjir eins mear jild yn.
I could not get her.	Ik koe har net krije.
Not hope, but faith.	Net hope, mar leauwe.
Had not tried to get her to bed.	Hie net besocht har op bêd te krijen.
I felt good about it.	Ik fielde my der goed oer.
Make sure you have friends.	Wês wis dat jo freonen hawwe.
I did not get angry.	Ik waard net lilk.
But even so, this is different.	Mar ek sa is dit oars.
I do not know what would happen.	Ik wit net wat der barre soe.
That's not how it works.	Sa wurket it net.
The work was not easy.	It wurk wie net maklik.
Neither of us could be happy for long, doing nothing.	Net ien fan ús koe lang bliid wêze, neat dwaan.
And so it goes on.	En sa giet it troch.
All he said was give it time.	Alles wat hy sei wie it tiid jaan.
I have three children.	Ik haw trije bern.
They had a large family.	Se hiene in grutte famylje.
She felt very tired.	Se fielde 'tige wurch.
Sit by me.	Sit by my.
That's it, it's not.	Dat is it, is it net.
When she did not want to be held.	Doe't se net hâlden wurde woe.
No one has ever said that life was easy.	Nimmen hat ea sein dat it libben maklik wie.
I think it should be you.	Ik tink dat it dy wêze moat.
This person does not have to be good.	Dizze persoan moat net goed wêze.
People would talk.	Minsken soene prate.
I had a little food.	Ik hie in bytsje iten.
Your whole life.	Jo hiele libben.
She knew her by name.	Se koe se by namme.
They decided they could do it.	Se besletten dat se dit kinne dwaan.
I have heard nothing from him.	Ik haw neat fan him heard.
You're scared of him.	Do bist bang foar him.
I've been there and done that.	Ik haw der west en dat dien.
She told me she could not stay long.	Se fertelde my dat se net lang bliuwe koe.
Today was our day.	Hjoed wie ús dei.
Never will happen.	Nea sil barre.
I just never found it.	Ik haw it gewoan noait fûn.
I'm gone forever, it seems.	Ik bin foar altyd fuort, liket it.
And you are.	En do bist.
And she's still there, they say.	En se is der noch, sa sizze se.
More as they play.	Mear as se spylje.
She was very kind to everyone.	Se wie heul aardich foar elkenien.
She could not do otherwise.	Se koe net oars.
You're coming back to me.	Jo komme werom nei my.
I can not work it out for me.	Ik kin it net foar my wurkje.
I liked it a lot!	Ik fûn it in protte!
They need us and we need them.	Se hawwe ús nedich en wy hawwe se nedich.
And that is them.	En dat binne se.
That worried me a lot.	Dat makke my tige soargen.
But she never did anything wrong.	Mar se hat noait wat ferkeard dien.
Let us please.	Lit ús asjebleaft wêze.
He looks at me.	Hy sjocht nei my.
I had no family.	Ik hie gjin famylje.
We wait until she comes home to find another dog.	Wy wachtsje oant se thús kaam om in oare hûn te finen.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Miskien, miskien, miskien.
So very alive.	Sa tige libben.
I'm kind of kid.	Ik bin aardich foar bern.
But not just work.	Mar net allinnich wurk.
Give me up.	Jou my op.
I need help.	Ik haw help nedich.
He was also not sure what to say to him.	Hy wie ek net wis wat er tsjin him sizze soe.
So it had to be.	Sa moast it wêze.
Well, do not worry about me.	No, meitsje jo gjin soargen oer my.
I'm in the next room.	Ik bin yn 'e folgjende keamer.
I did not find any.	Ik fûn gjinien.
But he is.	Mar hy is.
Mom was afraid of nothing.	Mem wie bang foar neat.
I really hope she does.	Ik hoopje echt dat se dat docht.
In a word, busy.	Yn in wurd, drok.
Even in a time like this.	Ek yn in tiid as dizze.
I do not know why he did not do that.	Ik wit net wêrom hy dat net die.
And she just will not eat.	En se sil gewoan net ite.
What good has it ever done ?.	Wat goed hat it oait dien?.
I can go back to school.	Ik kin werom nei skoalle.
This is true for everyone.	Dit is wier foar elkenien.
Now it gets better soon.	No wurdt it gau better.
But back to his wife went to bed.	Mar werom nei syn frou gie op bêd.
He asked no one again.	Hy frege gjinien wer.
That's what we want now.	Dat wolle wy no.
I had no idea what was going on.	Ik hie gjin idee wat der oan de hân wie.
I hope you find the same.	Ik hoopje dat jo it itselde fine.
You have to want to do it.	Jo moatte it dwaan wolle.
We want him gone.	Wy wolle him fuort.
Both her and her husband are always tired.	Sawol har as har man binne altyd wurch.
We will never know how much a pair is.	Wy sille nea witte hoefolle in pear is.
But that's it.	Mar dat is it.
I did not expect it to work, but it does.	Ik hie net ferwachte dat it soe wurkje, mar it docht.
But it does no good.	Mar it docht gjin goed.
Maybe we will.	Miskien sille wy.
But, it's what it is.	Mar, it is wat it is.
I will probably never see one.	Ik sil wierskynlik noait ien sjen.
I looked at them and asked the man how many they were.	Ik seach se nei en frege de man hoefolle se wiene.
That plan is not going well.	Dat plan giet net goed.
They just do things differently than we do.	Se dogge gewoan dingen oars as wy.
We will never be.	Wy sille nea wêze.
Maybe it's not necessary to do that.	Miskien is it net nedich om dat te dwaan.
Whether it works or not.	Of it wurket of net.
He was sick.	Hy wie siik.
The photo shows you that.	De foto lit jo dat sjen.
We wish him well.	Wy winskje him goed.
Everything she asked for.	Alles wat se frege.
This is her boy.	Dit is har jonge.
Many of us know you.	In protte fan ús witte jo.
Just look around a bit.	Sjoch mar in bytsje om.
Everyone was talking.	Elkenien wie oan it praten.
Let's try it now.	Litte wy it no besykje.
Must talk to.	Moat mei prate.
This is one of the last.	Dit is ien fan de lêste.
They are here to help.	Se binne hjir om te helpen.
She did not know who he was.	Se wist net wa't er wie.
She would wait until she knew for sure.	Se soe wachtsje oant se it wis wist.
So it seems like they're both doing the same thing.	Sa liket it derop dat se beide itselde dogge.
Without it it would not have worked.	Sûnder hie it net wurke.
We will try that next time.	Dat sille wy de folgjende kear besykje.
They have had many.	Se hawwe in protte hân.
I know it did.	Ik wit dat it dien hat.
There are so many things.	Der binne safolle dingen.
Please buy his book.	Keapje asjebleaft syn boek.
My mom loves her.	Myn mem hâldt fan har.
But he never said a word.	Mar hy sei nea in wurd.
If they can do it, so can we.	As se it kinne, kinne wy ​​dat ek.
We do not know why.	Wy witte net wêrom.
So this went on and on.	Sa gie dit troch en troch.
Please, do not take me badly.	Asjebleaft, nim my net min oan.
You need to know everything.	Jo moatte alles witte.
I can not keep the food.	Ik kin it iten net hâlde.
I want to see you every day.	Ik wol dy alle dagen sjen.
They need our help.	Se hawwe ús help nedich.
We're leaving in two hours.	Wy geane oer twa oeren fuort.
He knew he had to do something.	Hy wist dat er wat dwaan moast.
Asked if we would ever know.	Frege oft wy it oait witte soene.
I'm ready to be friends.	Ik bin ree om freonen te wêzen.
Help me out of this.	Help my út dit.
As soon as he can, he will pay.	Sa gau as er kin, sil er betelje.
We are not sure how to do that.	Wy binne der net wis fan hoe te dwaan dat.
It's not for everyone.	It is net foar elkenien.
But this is not the only one.	Mar dit is net de ienige.
I had hoped so too.	Dat hie ik ek hope.
You may ask why.	Jo kinne freegje wêrom.
But it does not always go that way.	Mar it giet net altyd sa.
It has never been done before.	It is noch noait earder dien.
You do not have to make the movie.	Jo hoege de film net te meitsjen.
I'm coming back, but not quite yet.	Ik kom werom, mar noch net hielendal.
It had to be the work, the school.	It moast it wurk wêze, de skoalle.
And we almost did.	En dat diene wy ​​hast.
And that's enough.	En dat is genôch.
I asked him, and he said he wanted to do it.	Ik frege him, en hy sei dat er it dwaan woe.
She felt much better about things.	Se fielde har folle better oer dingen.
My friends will not talk to me.	Myn freonen sille net mei my prate.
He would tell her.	Hy soe it har fertelle.
You have money.	Jo hawwe jild.
We can not do that.	Wy kinne dat net dwaan.
He knew her well.	Hy koe har goed.
We need them and they need us.	Wy hawwe se nedich en se hawwe ús nedich.
However, they would find nothing, these children.	Hoe dan ek, se soene neat fine, dizze bern.
I do not know if it has been done before.	Ik wit net oft it earder dien is.
But they think something else about it.	Mar se tinke der wat oars oer.
This must be the reason.	Dit moat de reden wêze.
It's everything and more.	It is alles en mear.
We'll probably like to talk about it.	Wy sille der wierskynlik graach oer prate.
I have to stop.	Ik moat ophâlde.
You can not be of me.	Jo kinne net fan my wêze.
For many, it was just too much.	Foar in protte wie it gewoan te folle.
You really have to try these.	Jo moatte dizze echt besykje.
I heard it myself.	Ik hearde it sels.
It would be best if you did not.	It soe it bêste wêze as jo dat net diene.
I could not, man.	Ik soe it net kinne, man.
To a thing.	Oan in ding.
She did not know who the man was.	Se wist net wa't de man wie.
They do, without being.	Se dogge, sûnder te wêzen.
I did both.	Ik die beide.
I want to keep looking at it.	Ik wol der nei sjen bliuwe.
It tells me nothing.	It seit my neat.
I put the water in a bowl.	Ik sette it wetter yn in kom.
Nobody knows her.	Nimmen ken har.
I just am.	Ik bin gewoan.
I see it so clearly in this.	Ik sjoch it sa dúdlik yn dit.
If she still agrees, think.	As se it noch iens is, tink.
It was too long ago.	It wie te lang lyn.
But he can not see you today.	Mar hy kin dy hjoed net sjen.
They had no children.	Se hiene gjin bern.
That you really need to know.	Dat moatte jo echt witte.
She said something to him.	Se sei wat tsjin him.
He was just back.	Hy wie krekt werom.
I do that.	Ik doch dat.
We did not have the time we needed.	Wy hiene net de tiid dy't wy nedich wiene.
I'm the only one who found something.	Ik bin de iennichste dy't wat fûn.
They are difficult.	Se binne dreech.
I was in class.	Ik wie yn 'e klasse.
He went back to his room.	Hy gie werom nei syn keamer.
I know him pretty well.	Ik ken him frij goed.
He had come to her house.	Hy wie by har hûs kommen.
But it was always like that.	Mar it wie altyd sa.
If so and.	As dan en.
They just can not.	Se kinne gewoan net.
Not sure if they go together or not.	Net wis oft dy gean tegearre of net.
It's not what we said.	It is net wat wy seine.
If no one sees him.	As nimmen him sjocht.
I just had to do it.	Ik moast it mar dwaan.
Of course he could come.	Fansels koe er wol komme.
Who will do it first ?.	Wa sil it earst dwaan?.
People were actually very interested in this.	Minsken wiene hjir eins tige ynteressearre yn.
Just in time you are.	Krekt op 'e tiid do bist.
They all want to be in your place.	Se wolle allegear op jo plak wêze.
Or it does not.	Of it docht net.
Which is better, who will say ?.	Wat is better, wa sil sizze?.
She just knew it was there.	Se wist gewoan dat it der wie.
He should of course be.	Hy soe fansels wêze moatte.
I actually know that.	Dat wit ik eins.
And do not know.	En wit it net.
She told him the whole truth.	Se fertelde him de hiele wierheid.
This was the big time.	Dit wie de grutte tiid.
Do not be too late.	Wês net te let.
I want to do this well.	Ik wol dit goed dwaan.
She has no money.	Se hat gjin jild.
It does not look good.	It liket net goed.
I never expected it to be such a place.	Ik hie nea ferwachte dat it sa'n plak soe wêze.
I've never met anyone like you.	Ik haw noch noait ien as jo moete.
The young couple walked away.	It jonge pear gie fuort fuort.
He came back again and wanted more.	Hy kaam wer werom en woe mear.
Well, let's let that in.	No, dan litte wy dat yn.
There was something else too.	Der wie ek wat oars.
But do not be afraid.	Mar wês net bang.
This would be my family.	Dit soe myn famylje wurde.
And it also looked beautiful.	En it seach ek moai út.
He would not give.	Hy soe net jaan.
He comes from a good family.	Hy komt út in goede famylje.
She does not look well.	Se sjocht der net goed út.
He tried, really did.	Hy besocht, echt die.
You’ve probably even had a job.	Jo hawwe wierskynlik sels in baan hân.
I stayed under.	Ik bleau ûnder.
This is beautiful.	Dizze is moai.
How long do you have to go.	Hoe lang moatte jo gean.
We are asked a lot about it.	Wy wurde der in protte oer frege.
No place.	Gjin plak.
His wife.	Syn frou.
Of course, you need to know that.	Fansels moatte jo dat witte.
He asked her about her life before any of this.	Hy frege har ôf oer har libben foardat ien fan dit.
There was absolutely no way for her to do it now.	Der wie hielendal gjin manier foar har om it no te dwaan.
I should have worried.	Ik hie my soargen moatten.
He quickly got back to bed.	Hy rûn gau wer op bêd.
About where you have been and where you plan to go.	Oer wêr't jo west hawwe en wêr't jo fan plan binne te gean.
You do not need a reason.	Jo hawwe gjin reden nedich.
Please, no more.	Asjebleaft, net mear.
You know what would happen.	Jo witte wat der barre soe.
That was about two years ago.	Dat wie sa'n twa jier lyn.
She had received it from her mother.	Se hie it fan har mem krigen.
Nice to be with.	Leuk om mei te wêzen.
But they were wrong.	Mar se wiene ferkeard.
The dog came back.	De hûn kaam werom.
It's one of a kind.	It is ien fan in soarte.
Do more with.	Mear dogge mei.
He could not say what it was.	Hy koe net sizze wat it wie.
In fact, we know it.	Eins witte wy it.
He was not a child.	Hy wie gjin bern.
There is a large lake near her house.	Der is in grutte mar by har hûs.
Maybe it will come out better this time.	Miskien komt it dizze kear better út.
But for him it was nothing.	Mar foar him wie it neat.
This is hope for me.	Dit is hope foar my.
It's just a door.	It is mar in doar.
This would not work.	Dit soe net wurkje.
No one has ever seen one.	Nimmen hat ea ien sjoen.
Someone in that office will help you figure this out.	Immen yn dat kantoar sil jo helpe dit út te finen.
It was clear he was angry.	It wie dúdlik dat er lilk wie.
If you did not do that, do it now.	As jo ​​dat net diene, doch se no.
He was not so happy.	Hy wie net sa bliid.
He is the one who asked you to do it.	Hy is dejinge dy't jo frege om it te dwaan.
There is a lot that can be said.	Der is in protte dat kin sein wurde.
We are all sick.	Wy binne allegear siik.
They never said a word.	Se seine noait in wurd.
So you said.	Sa hawwe jo sein.
I just can not see why it does not work here.	Ik kin gewoan net sjen wêrom't it hjir net wurket.
Her parents were not old.	Har âlden wiene net âld.
It will not be a problem.	It sil gjin probleem wêze.
Your plan works.	Jo plan wurket.
And there is no one else.	En der is gjinien oars.
I do not want other people's things.	Ik wol gjin dingen fan oare minsken.
It's enough.	It is genôch.
That had been a long time ago.	Dat hie al lang west.
I hope for the best.	Ik hoopje op it bêste.
On we go.	Op wy gean.
He did not look happy now.	Hy seach der no net bliid út.
They were worried.	Se wiene soargen.
He goes to bed.	Hy giet op bêd.
That was not enough yet.	Dat wie noch net genôch.
That went well.	Dat gie goed.
And even if you do not, you will have to buy one.	En sels as jo dat net dogge, moatte jo ien keapje.
They had spoken three days earlier.	Se hiene trije dagen earder praat.
It could not.	It koe net.
Many love him.	In protte hâlde fan him.
I did not say it.	Ik sei it net.
It should be enough.	It moat genôch wêze.
I think she was too scared.	Ik tink dat se te bang wie.
Something needs to be done.	Der moat wat dien wurde.
I did not even know they were there.	Ik wist net iens dat se der wiene.
I believe there is a place for it.	Ik leau dat der in plak foar is.
But we all knew it.	Mar wy wisten it allegear.
I no longer know what he said.	Ik wit net mear wat er sei.
After hours of this we find nothing.	Nei oeren fan dit fine wy ​​neat.
But it's true.	Mar it is wier.
Do not be afraid!	Wês net bang!
It's what we do and how we think.	It is wat wy dogge en hoe't wy tinke.
Tell your friends !.	Fertel dyn freonen!.
Everyone wants to be around you.	Elkenien wol om dy hinne wêze.
Just like his father.	Krekt as syn heit.
But they can be very different.	Mar se kinne hiel oars.
She would not stay.	Se soe net bliuwe.
Feel better tomorrow.	Fiel jo moarn better.
He hoped she would come.	Hy hope dat se komme soe.
I've seen it before.	Ik haw it earder sjoen.
I do not know why or when.	Ik wit net wêrom of wannear.
Mom will be happy.	Mem sil bliid wêze.
I'm over you.	Ik bin oer dy hinne.
I have to be there.	Ik moat der wêze.
A nice man.	In aardich man.
For better reason, it looks like a prison.	Foar bettere gedachten liket it in finzenis.
This was his only chance to get away.	Dit wie syn ienige kâns om fuort te kommen.
I'll be waiting for that.	Ik sil der op wachtsje.
That's just not good.	Dat is gewoan net goed.
She did not look at me again.	Se seach my net wer oan.
They really knew what to do.	Se wisten echt wat te dwaan.
Be careful what you believe.	Wês foarsichtich wat jo leauwe.
There is not much more to it.	Der is net folle mear oan.
Please enter your name and city.	Jou asjebleaft jo namme en stêd op.
Win, and it could be a good year.	Winne, en it kin in goed jier wêze.
Not once a year.	Net ien kear yn it jier.
I can not wait to see you.	Ik kin net wachtsje om dy te sjen.
I have not decided yet.	Ik haw my noch net besletten.
There was a girl and a boy.	Der wiene in famke en in jonge.
They may even ask you to help them.	Se kinne jo sels freegje om har te helpen.
He did not want to talk to me.	Hy woe net mei my prate.
Always keep the photo in your mind.	Hâld de foto altyd yn jo gedachten.
This was very nice.	Dit wie hiel aardich.
I could not believe her.	Ik koe har net leauwe.
These were my friends for life.	Dit wiene myn freonen foar it libben.
It would make you sick.	It soe jo siik meitsje.
But we are going through this together.	Mar wy geane dit tegearre troch.
I just work here.	Ik wurkje hjir gewoan.
And these are for you.	En dizze binne foar jo.
There it was better.	Dêr wie it better.
Just go with it, then it will come by itself.	Gean der mar mei, dan komt it fan himsels.
But there was nothing to see.	Mar der wie neat te sjen.
A little bit.	In bytsje.
But she was not, and she knew it.	Mar se wie net, en se wist it.
I have it with me.	Ik haw it mei my.
Free and clear.	Frij en dúdlik.
He's not there.	Hy is der net.
He had to take care of her.	Hy moast foar har soargje.
I would not ask that of you.	Dat soe ik dy net freegje.
Work with me.	Wurkje mei my.
I told you so before.	Ik hie it dy earder sein.
Think you were wrong about everything.	Tink dat jo oer alles ferkeard wiene.
I know he just wants the best for you.	Ik wit dat hy gewoan it bêste foar jo wol.
All on time.	Alles op tiid.
We can not know.	Wy kinne net witte.
No one came.	Der is net ien kommen.
But it's not easy to stay awake.	Mar it is net maklik om wekker te bliuwen.
He must leave and he must leave now.	Hy moat fuort en hy moat no fuort.
It came out well.	It kaam goed út.
And no one heard anything.	En nimmen hearde wat.
She was still unsure of him.	Se wie noch net wis fan him.
He was too busy for us.	Hy wie te drok foar ús.
Do not do my work for me.	Doch myn wurk net foar my.
But those days were in the past.	Mar dy dagen wiene yn it ferline.
Come on, we'll be late.	Kom, wy komme te let.
I will not tell you if you do not.	Ik sil it net fertelle as jo dat net dogge.
I thought about food.	Ik tocht oer iten.
I must say.	Ik moat sizze.
Here, try it now.	Hjir, besykje it no.
She was not sure.	Se wie der net wis fan.
It could have been so much better.	It koe safolle better.
I do not know where we are now.	Ik wit net wêr't wy no binne.
That would not be difficult to do.	Dat soe net dreech wêze om te dwaan.
A few times a year.	In pear kear yn it jier.
You have the words for it.	Jo hawwe de wurden foar it.
You met him.	Jo moete him.
So it was hard to figure out.	Sa wie it dreech om út te finen.
They can be me.	Se kinne my wêze.
You're in my way.	Do bist my yn 'e wei.
One chance, that was it.	Ien kâns, dat wie it.
Come on and.	Kom op en.
She was already gone.	Se wie al fuort.
Something is added or not.	Der komt wat by of net.
I expected to see it there.	Ik ferwachte it dêr te sjen.
They had nothing of it.	Se hiene der neat fan.
He works over.	Hy wurket oer.
I was not happy about this.	Ik wie net bliid oer dit.
You found her husband.	Jo hawwe har man fûn.
He really needed two.	Hy hie twa echt nedich.
I do not need the work so much.	Ik haw it wurk net sa folle nedich.
And you know, it was totally good.	En jo witte, it wie hielendal goed.
She could not win it.	Se koe dit net winne.
Then there were the people.	Dan wiene der de minsken.
They always ask you for more money.	Se freegje jo altyd om mear jild.
He does not want us to leave here, one of us.	Hy wol net dat wy hjir wei komme, ien fan ús.
He will.	Hy sil.
You have to give it to him.	Jo moatte it him jaan.
That he was not.	Dat wie hy net.
It got bad.	It waard min.
You may need it.	Jo kinne it nedich hawwe.
My father knew what was happening.	Myn heit wist wat der barde.
I'll be ready.	Ik sil klear wêze.
I think this is going to be really fun.	Ik tink dat dit echt leuk wurdt.
But it obviously is not.	Mar it is fansels net.
But you will not want to do this.	Mar jo sille dit net wolle dwaan.
I just need to see her.	Ik moat har gewoan sjen.
It's just the two of them.	It binne mar de twa.
Or he would not really want to know.	Of hy soe it eins net witte wolle.
And it really took over.	En it naam echt oer.
There is everything.	Dêr is alles.
I did not get better.	Ik haw it net better.
We've talked about it.	Wy hawwe der oer praat.
This book was so hard, but not hard.	Dit boek wie sa hurd, mar net dreech.
They were not surprised.	Se wiene net ferrast.
He had heard all this before.	Hy hie dit alles earder heard.
That used to be not the case.	Dat wie eartiids net sa.
Or she could have.	Of se koe hawwe.
I've never heard or read that before.	Dat haw ik noch nea heard of lêzen.
Can anyone please help me on this.	Kin immen asjebleaft helpe my op dizze.
There's no way to tell until it's too late.	D'r is gjin manier om te fertellen oant it te let is.
I have been looking at the plan.	Ik haw nei it plan sjoen.
He did not make it.	Hy makke it net.
Or two if he wants to.	Of twa as er wol.
But this is so much more.	Mar dit is safolle mear.
But only a little.	Mar mar in bytsje.
Which was clear.	Wat dúdlik wie.
I just wanted to know how it was with you today.	Ik woe gewoan witte hoe't it mei jo wie hjoed.
I was worried this time last year.	Ik wie soargen dizze tiid ferline jier.
Well, that's not the case.	No, sa is it net.
I heard that.	Ik hearde dat.
And happened so long ago.	En barde sa lang lyn.
Here was her chance.	Hjir wie har kâns.
I believe it can be of anything if.	Ik leau dat it fan alles kin wêze as.
Maybe we do, maybe not.	Miskien dogge wy, miskien net.
She walked away with him.	Se rûn mei him fuort.
It was a good one.	It wie in goede ien.
We do not talk much.	Wy prate net folle.
As a child I was very worried about life.	As bern wie folle soargen oer it libben.
It was not easy, but he did.	It wie net maklik, mar hy die.
I have to work late tonight.	Ik moat fannacht let wurkje.
As if that would do anything.	As soe dat wat dwaan.
I'm not home.	Ik bin net thús.
If you do not want to, then do not.	As jo ​​​​net wolle, dan net.
In fact, it was my job.	Eins wie it myn wurk.
It was probably the only way in and out.	It wie wierskynlik de ienige manier yn en út.
And you can have them.	En jo kinne se hawwe.
But they are not.	Mar dat binne se net.
She would just have to deal with it now.	Se soe der no mar mei dwaan moatte.
People were happy.	Minsken wiene bliid.
But it is so found.	Mar it is sa fûn.
And still go to school.	En noch nei skoalle gean.
But they are not easy.	Mar se binne net maklik.
I hope this can be of some help.	Ik hoopje dat dit kin wêze fan alle help.
We think we do, but we do not.	Wy tinke dat wy dogge, mar wy dogge it net.
I did that.	Dat haw ik dien.
It had been happening since she was a girl.	It wie al bart sûnt se wie in famke.
But not as much as people say.	Mar net sa folle as minsken sizze.
We will do what is expected of us.	Wy sille dwaan wat der fan ús ferwachte wurdt.
I asked for nothing.	Ik frege om neat.
I'm so tired of being wrong, she thought.	Ik bin sa wurch fan ferkeard wêze, tocht se.
He did not know what else she could do.	Hy wist net wêr't se noch mear om koe.
But he did not have to take it up.	Mar hy hoegde it net op te nimmen.
I can not give my name.	Ik kin myn namme net jaan.
He had been here before.	Hy hie hjir earder west.
Not more than you want!	Net mear as jo wolle!
What happened is this.	Wat barde is dit.
She was very tall.	Se wie tige lang.
Neither has the past.	It ferline ek net.
More about who he was.	Mear oer wa't hy wie.
They had no time for that.	Dêr hiene se gjin tiid foar.
There's nothing you can not have.	D'r is neat dat jo net hawwe kinne.
I'm thinking of buying a new car.	Ik tink der oer om in nije auto te keapjen.
A person.	In persoan.
It's not something you can buy.	It is net wat jo kinne keapje.
She knows it can be difficult for people.	Se wit dat it dreech wêze kin foar minsken.
They wish she had more time to read.	Se winskje dat se mear tiid hie om te lêzen.
Be happy for me.	Wês bliid foar my.
You have something else.	Jo hawwe wat oars.
But the people have to eat.	Mar de minsken moatte ite.
You seemed to need me.	Jo like my nedich te hawwen.
I did not read the book.	Ik haw it boek net lêzen.
He just needs time.	Hy hat gewoan tiid nedich.
That was for sure.	Dat wie wis.
This was my chance.	Dit wie myn kâns.
Well, many things would be different.	No, in protte dingen soene oars wêze.
She needed some help.	Se hie wat help nedich.
We find no one here.	Wy fine hjir gjinien.
He thought no one else could.	Hy tocht dat nimmen oars it koe.
That they can be.	Dat se kinne wêze.
I'm not really sure.	Ik bin der net echt wis fan.
It's not too late for you now.	It is no net te let foar dy.
No words were needed.	Gjin wurden wiene nedich.
Well, it has to.	No, it moat wol.
The work is not for tomorrow.	It wurk is net foar moarn.
There did not seem to be much more to say.	Der like net folle mear te sizzen.
You do not have to talk about it if you do not want to.	Jo hoege der net oer te praten as jo net wolle.
They make us out.	Se meitsje ús út.
I will be his wife.	Ik sil syn frou wêze.
He might not have been a police officer.	Hy soe miskien gjin plysje west hawwe.
I've been having a few issues lately as well.	Ik haw de lêste tiid ek in pear problemen hân.
Never again.	Nea wer.
I have not kept my word to you.	Ik haw myn wurd tsjin dy net hâlden.
I want you to speak for me.	Ik wol dat jo foar my prate.
One is the new one.	Ien is de nije.
And that seems to me too much.	En dat liket my te folle.
One is that this was not necessary.	Ien is dat dit net nedich wie.
You can see it today.	Jo kinne it hjoed sjen.
Not that week.	Net dy wike.
She has none.	Se hat gjinien.
You just found it.	Jo hawwe it krekt fûn.
To tell me she loves me.	Om my te fertellen dat se fan my hâlde.
And in bed.	En op bêd.
They will get it somehow.	Se sille it op ien of oare manier krije.
You have to do what you have to do.	Jo moatte dwaan wat jo dwaan moatte.
This is the life of faith.	Dit is it libben fan it leauwe.
This is exactly what we want.	Dit is krekt wat wy wolle.
What is your favorite food?	Wat is dyn favorite iten?
Maybe he's the man you want.	Miskien is hy de man dy't jo wolle.
As soon as you are good.	Sa gau as jo binne goed.
Or she would in a few days.	Of se soe oer in pear dagen.
That the he.	Dat die hy.
Do you have no other things to do?	Hawwe jo gjin oare dingen te dwaan?
I see what he has done for the city.	Ik sjoch wat er foar de stêd dien hat.
He has no money.	Hy hat gjin jild.
They will not be so happy.	Se sille net sa bliid wêze.
I can not tell you what will happen.	Ik kin jo net fertelle wat der barre sil.
It may not come to me soon enough.	It kin my net gau genôch komme.
It's nice enough for me.	It is moai genôch foar my.
She was free.	Se wie frij.
Otherwise, not so much.	Oars, net sa folle.
I've never heard of it before.	Ik hearde it lêste der noch noait fan.
You're good to me too.	Do bist ek goed foar my.
You do not have to do everything.	Jo hoege net alles te dwaan.
Everything is too good.	Alles is te goed.
I said it to everyone.	Ik sei it tsjin elkenien.
This kind of thing we have obviously seen before.	Dit soarte ding hawwe wy fansels earder sjoen.
Just easy to have.	Gewoan maklik om te hawwen.
He was now not only a man.	Hy wie no net allinnich in man.
This year should be different.	Dit jier moat oars.
But he would soon get tired.	Mar hy soe gau wurch wurde.
I give him nothing.	Ik jou him neat.
He will be here.	Hy sil hjir wêze.
Maybe the police were back.	Miskien wie de plysje werom.
My whole life.	Myn hiele libben.
Must find a good book to read.	Moat in goed boek fine om te lêzen.
As it is.	Sa as it is.
Almost all of us.	Hast allegear fan ús.
I go to sleep.	Ik gean op bêd.
I can not wait to see you again.	Ik kin net wachtsje om dy wer te sjen.
They have been doing this a lot lately.	Dat dogge se de lêste tiid in protte.
We better take care of it in a few days.	Wy kinne der better in pear dagen foar soargje.
She was easy to talk to.	Se wie maklik om mei te praten.
That is, if you really want to get home.	Dat is, as jo echt thús komme wolle.
I'm not sure how this should work.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe't dit moat wurkje.
To look! 	Sjen!
No one was needed.	Gjinien wie nedich.
Soe say.	Soe sizze.
We are here to help you.	Wy binne hjir om jo te helpen.
Good job.	Goed wurk.
I never give up.	Ik jou nea op.
This year he is back with a new one.	Dit jier is er werom mei in nije.
He waited until everyone was gone.	Hy wachte oant elkenien fuort wie.
It was not there.	It wie der net.
If you can help others, do it as much as you can.	As jo ​​​​oare helpe kinne, doch it dan safolle as jo kinne.
I do not think anyone really does.	Ik tink net dat immen dat echt docht.
He had nothing to say about it.	Hy hie der neat oer te sizzen.
Wait and see with me.	Wachtsje en sjoch mei my.
It's done now.	It is no dien.
They said you should eat everything.	Se seine dat jo alles ite soene.
He finished the book just in time, he says.	Hy hat it boek krekt op tiid klear, seit er.
But that was never for him.	Mar dat wie nea foar him.
He hoped it was one of the last two.	Hy hope dat it ien fan de lêste twa wie.
That should be enough.	Dat soe genôch wêze moatte.
He's a good guy.	Hy is in goede keardel.
I hope you come soon.	Ik hoopje dat jo gau komme.
Not many, but a few.	Net in protte, mar in pear.
As an idea.	As idee.
But it's too late.	Mar it is te let.
It was just too much for him.	It wie him gewoan te folle.
Everyone wants some money!	Elkenien wol wat jild!
I'll do that.	Ik sil dat dwaan.
He had no mother or father.	Hy hie gjin mem of heit.
He was always giving.	Hy wie altyd jaan.
You will probably be fine.	Jo sille wierskynlik goed wêze.
We did not do it.	Wy hawwe it net dien.
But there is more.	Mar der is mear.
And like it and all.	En like it en al.
He should not have.	Hy hie net moatten.
It was really fun to watch.	It wie echt leuk om te sjen.
Too easy, she thought.	Te maklik, tocht se.
This is no longer true.	Dit is net mear wier.
They just became.	It binne gewoan wurden.
We put things first.	Wy sette earste dingen earst.
Be that as it may.	Noch dat sein.
And she has a name.	En se hat in namme.
The other guy.	De oare keardel.
No one is who they look like.	Nimmen is wa't se lykje.
And that too.	En ek dat.
It was him too.	It wie him ek.
I'm giving up.	Ik jou op.
I never told him about my worries.	Ik haw him noait ferteld oer myn soargen.
We also want to make someone as happy as we are now.	Wy wolle ek immen sa bliid meitsje as wy no binne.
I will be.	Ik sil wêze.
I should have known you could not get through.	Ik hie witte moatten dat jo der net troch koene.
You may like it.	Jo kinne it leuk fine.
You can make some big money.	Jo kinne meitsje wat grutte jild.
You did not say that.	Dat hawwe jo net sein.
I walked by.	Ik rûn troch.
Words are good.	Wurden binne goed.
She had to go back home.	Se moast werom nei hûs.
There's one thing they did not tell you.	Der is ien ding dat se jo net ferteld hawwe.
Nothing worked.	Neat wurke.
So far she has not been back.	Oant no ta is se net werom west.
Not mine, never never.	Net myn, nea nea.
It's another reason.	It is in oare reden.
I'm sure she has.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se hat.
You just stay away from them.	Jo bliuwe gewoan fan har ôf.
It works well.	It wurket goed.
Well, this is not entirely true.	No, dit is net hielendal wier.
There's more in life to look forward to tonight.	D'r is mear yn it libben om nei út te sjen nei fannacht.
I got a lot of help.	Ik krige in protte help.
For a very long time.	Hiel lang eins.
He did not tell anyone where he was going.	Hy fertelde gjinien wêr't er hinne soe.
But that's not yet what you want.	Mar dat is noch net wat jo wolle.
You can not be both.	Jo kinne net beide wêze.
We talk every day.	Wy prate alle dagen.
Of course not one of us.	Fansels net ien fan ús.
It's not enough.	It is net genôch.
We all knew this time was coming.	Wy wisten allegear dat dizze tiid komme soe.
The couple had two children together.	It pear hie tegearre twa bern.
I feel good.	Ik fiel my goed.
Be carefull .	Wês foarsichtich .
When it happens, it happens.	As it bart, bart.
He found it difficult to walk.	Hy fûn it dreech om te gean.
She seemed to be doing this without talking now.	Se like dit te dwaan sûnder te praten no.
Maybe that was the idea.	Miskien wie dat it idee.
I do not want to say any other things to you.	Ik wol gjin oare dingen tsjin dy sizze.
I do not know what the problem is.	Ik wit net wat it probleem is.
I have us here.	Ik haw ús hjir.
I got them out and gave him one.	Ik krige se út en joech him ien.
Just look at what's happening today.	Sjoch mar wat der hjoed bart.
It was too real.	It wie te echt.
So we just go with what we go with.	Sa geane wy ​​gewoan mei wat wy mei geane.
We could do a lot.	Wy koene in protte dwaan.
Was it the same for you?	Wie it itselde foar dy?
He was so good last night.	Hy wie sa goed fannacht.
Is just different.	Is gewoan oars.
If anyone heard anything they would have done.	As immen wat hearde soe se dien hawwe.
He says.	Hy seit.
It did not like her.	It like har net.
He may even be good.	Hy kin sels goed wêze.
I hit one with my hand.	Ik rekke ien mei myn hân.
Don't worry.	Meitsje dy gjin soargen.
The police will not like that.	De plysje sil dat net leuk fine.
They are not coming to the party!	Se komme net nei it feest!
He was sure of it.	Hy wie der wis fan.
Had no help last year.	Hie gjin help ferline jier.
A lot of people were there for me.	In protte minsken wiene der foar my.
You have to do this.	Jo moatte dit dwaan.
She also needs a house.	Se hat ek in hûs nedich.
He was not surprised.	Hy wie net ferrast.
This time is no different.	Dizze kear is net oars.
He met a woman at the party.	Hy moete in frou op it feest.
Which, in a way, he has.	Wat, op in manier, hy hat.
He's gone in the morning.	Hy is fan 'e moarn fuort.
I love her.	Ik hâld fan har.
I'm sure of that.	Dêr bin ik wis fan.
She thinks she can help him over.	Se tinkt dat se him helpe kin oer har hinne.
She ran away from home.	Se rûn fan hûs wei.
What's wrong with me? 	Wat bart der mei my?
I heard everything they said.	Ik hearde alles wat se seine.
I went back to the car.	Ik gie werom nei de auto.
My dog ​​is old.	Myn hûn is âld.
She says she can not believe it.	Se seit dat se it net leauwe kin.
Somehow he has become a father.	Op ien of oare manier is er heit wurden.
It will do nothing.	It sil neat dwaan.
I sympathize with you.	Ik fiel mei dy mei.
She looked around for some water.	Se seach om har hinne nei wat wetter.
None of us could say how it would go.	Net ien fan ús koe sizze hoe't it gean soe.
Let's talk about this.	Lit ús prate oer dit.
In a year or two we will be fine.	Oer in jier as twa binne wy ​​goed.
Nobody knew exactly what he was going to do.	Nimmen wist krekt wat er dwaan soe.
He says he does not, but he does.	Hy seit dat er net docht, mar hy docht.
I looked at it.	Ik seach der nei.
And there we went wrong.	En dêr binne wy ​​ferkeard gien.
The guy came up.	De keardel kaam op.
I will not have it.	Ik sil it net hawwe.
He was still waiting for her to talk.	Hy wachte noch op har om te praten.
This man is a man of his word.	Dizze man is in man fan syn wurd.
It almost put her off.	It sette har hast fuort.
He says something.	Hy seit wat.
It was all he could do.	It wie alles wat er dwaan koe.
That, of course, did not happen.	Dat kaam fansels net foar.
That he would talk to her like that.	Dat er sa mei har prate soe.
This was so wrong for him.	Dit wie sa ferkeard foar him.
I wonder where she's from.	Ik freegje my ôf wêr't se wei is.
That’s what they tell us now.	Dat sizze se ús no.
But we need to give them help.	Mar wy moatte har help jaan.
It may need some more.	It kin wat mear nedich wêze.
She never liked this bit.	Se hat noait leuk dit bytsje.
Something more than.	Wat mear as.
It's coming.	It komt oan.
You knew they were.	Jo wisten dat se wiene.
Do things that make you happy.	Doch dingen dy't jo bliid meitsje.
And it can not happen.	En it kin net barre.
That was a bad idea.	Dat wie in min idee.
He was right there.	Hy wie der krekt.
There was a plan.	Der wie in plan.
We still hope.	Wy hoopje noch.
We are happy together.	Wy binne bliid tegearre.
If not, you have only one.	As net, dan hawwe jo mar ien.
I thought it would help me get better.	Ik tocht dat it my helpe soe better wurde.
He would have to go to school.	Hy soe op skoalle moatte.
Had to see her.	Moast har sjen.
Enough has already happened.	Der is al genôch bard.
I did not see why.	Ik seach net wêrom.
I should never have gone there.	Ik hie der nea hinne moatten.
He hopes	Hy hope
I've had it for a long time.	Ik haw it lang hân.
Even of himself.	Sels fan himsels.
Would love to see more of this !.	Soe graach sjen mear fan dit!.
You should have both.	Jo moatte beide hawwe.
You have a good name.	Do hast in goede namme.
With everyone, really.	Mei elkenien, echt.
And his family had dinner together.	En syn famylje hie tegearre iten.
I'll show you how it's done.	Ik sil dy sjen litte hoe't it dien is.
You want to do good, make good worries.	Jo wolle goed dwaan, goede soargen meitsje.
But she'll have to tell you about that.	Mar dêr sil se dy wol oer fertelle moatte.
I felt for him.	Ik fielde foar him.
It could happen to anyone.	It koe elkenien barre.
This was your house.	Dit wie dyn hûs.
That's what she told me earlier.	Dat fertelde se my earder.
But, maybe, not for you.	Mar, miskien, net foar jo.
It must be you.	It moat dy wêze.
Are not so.	Binne dat net sa.
There was nothing.	Dêr wie neat.
I'm coming to life again.	Ik kom wer ta libben.
They need you here.	Se hawwe jo hjir nedich.
It was more that the time had just come.	It wie mear dat de tiid krekt kommen wie.
It could be anything.	It koe neat wêze.
Keep them for now.	Hâld se foar no.
It's beautiful and.	It is moai en.
They had run for what seemed like forever.	Se hiene rûn foar wat like foar altyd.
Could not even get that right.	Koe dat net iens goed krije.
Lots of good friends too.	In protte goede freonen ek.
No one will ever know your name.	Nimmen sil jo namme ea witte.
I did not like to have anything to do.	Ik mocht net graach neat te dwaan hawwe.
It's what you want to do.	It is wat jo dwaan wolle.
However, it's good to see you again.	Hoe dan ek, it is goed om dy wer te sjen.
It's just not the whole job.	It is gewoan net de hiele baan.
Having a dog in the house is a bad idea.	In hûn yn 'e hûs hawwe is in min idee.
So we are still together.	Sa binne wy ​​noch tegearre.
Is that all?	Is dat alles?
He wanted nothing.	Hy woe neat.
Do the best you can with everything.	Doch it bêste dat jo kinne mei alles.
Can't do it tonight.	Kin it fannacht net dwaan.
He was not so sure.	Hy wie net sa wis.
Where are we going today?	Wêr geane wy ​​hjoed hinne?
But know this.	Mar wit dit.
But that's not what happened.	Mar dat is net wat der bard is.
It really had it all.	It hie echt alles.
I do not know this.	Ik wit dit net.
They decided it was best to go to the police.	Se besletten dat it it bêste wie om nei de plysje te gean.
Go where you want to go.	Gean wêr't jo hinne wolle.
This is exactly what he is for.	Dit is krekt wêr't hy foar is.
First you will.	Earst sille jo.
Or try to.	Of besykje te.
Never tell her she's too good for you.	Fertel har noait dat se te goed foar jo is.
You can, you know.	Jo kinne, jo witte.
No work, no food.	Gjin wurk, gjin iten.
Everyone was talking about that.	Dêr hie elkenien it oer.
There was much more.	Der wie folle mear.
And this way you are.	En dizze manier do bist.
I was never a child.	Ik wie nea in bern.
She should not have done that either.	Dat hie se ek net dwaan moatten.
I wonder how they do that.	Ik freegje my ôf hoe't se dat dogge.
The room will not work with more than one person in it.	De keamer sil net wurkje mei mear as ien persoan yn it.
Not so much anymore.	Net sa folle mear.
He is scared, and with reason.	Hy is bang, en mei reden.
I love this house.	Ik hâld fan dit hûs.
This is the you you want to be.	Dit is de jo dy't jo wêze wolle.
No one seemed to have heard anything.	Nimmen like wat heard te hawwen.
I do not like to talk about it.	Ik praat der net graach oer.
Everything has to stop.	Alles moat ophâlde.
Everything went well at first.	Alles gie earst goed.
It's time for bed.	It is tiid foar bêd.
What does not, probably will not.	Wat net docht, sil wierskynlik net.
And he the.	En hy die.
I'll put him in front of you.	Ik sil him foar jo sette.
About both things.	Oer beide dingen.
But of course there is much more to it.	Mar der sit fansels noch folle mear oan.
Or can be.	Of kin wêze.
You do not want that.	Dat wolle jo net.
About everything and everything.	Oer alles en alles.
And we are working hard on that.	En dêr wurkje wy hurd oan.
Easy to read for him.	Maklik te lêzen foar him.
Just not true.	Gewoan net wier.
You were worried about me.	Jo wiene soargen foar my.
And if it does not.	En as it net docht.
They were real.	Se wiene echt.
But hope not too much.	Mar hoopje net te folle.
He has done a good job.	Hy hat goed wurk dien.
I do not think they can do it themselves.	Ik tink net dat se it sels kinne.
I should.	Ik soe.
Now you can do whatever you want.	No kinne jo dwaan wat jo wolle.
It does not seem real, nothing of it does.	It liket net echt, neat fan it docht.
She had to look away.	Se moast fuort sjen.
A father in the wrong.	In heit yn it ferkeard.
I need nothing.	Ik haw neat nedich.
Wants he did not.	Wol dat er net die.
I can't.	Ik kin net.
And so they were often.	En sa wiene se faak.
Almost easy money.	Hast maklik jild.
I just got a letter a few days ago.	Ik krige krekt in pear dagen lyn in brief.
Is that what happens.	Is dat wat bart.
You are one of his.	Do bist ien fan syn.
I love my room.	Ik hâld fan myn keamer.
This is the year he died.	Dit is it jier dat hy stoar.
I'm going to jail forever.	Ik gean foar altyd nei de finzenis.
He wanted nothing to do with her.	Hy woe neat mei har te krijen hawwe.
I do not know much about any of you.	Ik wit net folle oer ien fan dy.
He's coming back.	Hy komt werom.
By the man.	By de man.
You will be surprised at how much this works.	Jo sille ferrast wurde oer hoefolle dit wurket.
Never ever do that.	Nea ea dwaan dat.
That's not something.	Dat is net wat.
Well, it was a lot.	No, it wie in protte.
Maybe a good idea.	Miskien in goed idee.
Time has gone wrong.	De tiid is ferkeard gien.
He was able to go to the police.	Hy koe nei de plysje.
I really have nothing to do with it.	Ik ha der echt neat oan.
But I can say this.	Mar ik kin dit sizze.
Well, they are not.	No, dat binne se net.
This time he did back.	Dizze kear die er werom.
You should have talked to him.	Do hiest mei him prate moatten.
Feel free to help find.	Fiel jo frij om te helpen te finen.
I had to leave early today.	Ik moast hjoed betiid fuort.
For a few days.	Foar in pear dagen.
No show required.	Gjin sjen litte nedich.
We get a lot from that.	Dêr krije wy in protte fan.
Nothing came in.	Der kaam neat yn.
Well, she would not do it.	No, se soe it net dwaan.
Please do more.	Doch asjebleaft mear.
Or to the children.	Of nei de bern.
We knew there would not be.	Wy wisten dat d'r net wêze soe.
She was too sure of that.	Se wie der te wis fan.
She would pay for it.	Se soe it betelje.
But this can just as well work.	Mar dit kin gewoan ek wurkje.
Now is the time.	No komt de tiid.
I really did not think of anything else.	Ik tocht eins net oan wat oars.
He does not want to believe it.	Hy wol it net leauwe.
She should not be angry at me.	Se moat net lilk op my wêze.
But we will see them soon.	Mar wy sille se gau sjen.
I have to get old.	Ik moat âld wurde.
Who knows where.	Wa wit wêr.
This photo is incorrect.	Dizze foto is ferkeard.
This thing really works.	Dit ding wurket echt.
The dog seems tired.	De hûn liket wurch.
If she ever had children.	As se ea bern hie.
They never met him again.	Se moete him nea wer.
It must stop.	It moat ophâlde.
It does not seem to have been.	It liket net west te hawwen.
Let them try to stop me.	Lit se besykje my tsjin te hâlden.
Maybe there is someone in the family who can help.	Miskien is der ien yn 'e famylje dy't helpe kin.
She was scared of that dog.	Se wie bang foar dy hûn.
Can't do it.	Kin it net dwaan.
I let him take nothing else from you.	Ik lit him neat oars fan dy nimme.
We will not say more about that.	Dêr sille wy net mear oer sizze.
So it was with us.	Sa wie it mei ús.
Or so it felt.	Of sa fielde it wol.
It looks like they were right here.	It liket derop dat se hjir krekt wiene.
I hope they did something about it.	Ik hoopje dat se der wat oan dien hawwe.
It did it.	Dit die it.
It would be a nice place for a few days.	It soe in moai plak wêze foar in pear dagen.
I do not think that is true.	Ik tink net dat dat wier is.
I just wanted to talk to you.	Ik woe gewoan mei dy prate.
I do not think twice.	Ik tink net twa kear.
I do not want a mother mother.	Ik wol gjin mem mem.
Hope you are too.	Hoopje dat jo ek binne.
It felt good, really good.	It fielde goed, echt goed.
You have no money for a house.	Jo hawwe gjin jild foar in hûs.
I hold his hand.	Ik hâld syn hân.
You think back to it.	Jo tinke der oan werom.
This is the best opportunity to do this.	Dit is de bêste kâns om dit te dwaan.
We had no home, no place.	Wy hiene gjin thús, gjin plak.
I heard it open, did not see it.	Ik hearde it iepen, seach it net.
They both think that the other has what they need.	Se tinke beide dat de oare hat wat se nedich binne.
No one will help you.	Nimmen sil dy helpe.
What kind of dog was that?	Wat foar hûn wie dat?
And they will never find us.	En se sille ús noait fine.
Neither had any.	Ek hie gjinien.
These are all problems now.	Dit binne no allegear problemen.
The same can be done to the other two.	Itselde kin dien wurde oan de oare twa.
This is what you need to do.	Dit is wat jo moatte dwaan.
Your parents are here.	Jo âlden binne hjir.
You're not my father.	Do bist myn heit net.
This is not what we need.	Dit is net wat wy nedich binne.
Be a woman.	Wês in frou.
He is no longer a child.	Hy is gjin bern mear.
I do not show it.	Ik lit it net sjen.
He was completely alone.	Hy wie hielendal allinnich.
The other was me.	De oare wie ik.
They are good enough.	Se binne goed genôch.
They can not wait to leave.	Se kinne net wachtsje om fuort te gean.
Do not want to.	Net wolle.
I'm not sure what it was.	Ik bin der net wis fan wat it wie.
I have no idea at all.	Ik haw hielendal gjin idee.
And that's right.	En dat is krekt.
I just go with what he says and does now.	Ik gean mar mei wat er no seit en docht.
You know, you're really beautiful.	Jo witte, do bist echt moai.
And so we just know.	En sa witte wy gewoan.
We need to do something, she said.	Wy moatte wat dwaan, sei se.
Maybe he felt the same.	Miskien fielde er itselde.
Let me see then.	Lit my dan sjen.
I was very surprised.	Ik wie tige ferrast.
I always do.	Dat doch ik altyd.
Or he had made time.	Of hy hie tiid makke.
Well, nice.	No, moai.
He got some water and food.	Hy krige in bytsje wetter en iten.
It was not what she did for her.	It wie net wat se foar har die.
I think it would be very difficult.	Ik tink dat it soe wêze hiel dreech.
They are working on it now.	Se wurkje der no oan.
We tried almost everything.	Wy hawwe hast alles besocht.
And now here she is.	En no hjir is se.
You have to take a chance.	Jo moatte in kâns nimme.
I've been here since that time.	Ik bin hjir sûnt dy tiid.
He never said that this life would be easy.	Hy hat nea sein dat dit libben maklik wêze soe.
A good friend of mine.	In goede freon fan my.
All things can happen in that time.	Alle dingen kinne barre yn dy tiid.
I'm very happy with that.	Ik bin der tige bliid mei.
He has always been such a good kid.	Hy hat altyd sa'n goed bern west.
I have to get ready to go at once.	Ik moat my yn ien kear klear meitsje om te gean.
She was surprised when she saw him.	Se wie ferrast doe't se him seach.
And too scared to say anything.	En te bang om wat te sizzen.
That we just were not.	Dat wiene wy ​​gewoan net.
I'll be waiting for you here.	Ik sil hjir op dy wachtsje.
It was past time.	It wie ferline tiid.
And now my family is gone.	En no is myn famylje fuort.
We are not home for long.	Wy binne lang net thús.
She left the door open.	Se liet de doar iepen.
I did not see it that way.	Ik seach it net sa.
I know they're out there.	Ik wit dat se der út binne.
Maybe not before.	Miskien noch net earder.
The boy was no longer there.	De jonge wie der net mear.
You will have a bad time.	Jo sille in minne tiid hawwe.
I just sat and did nothing.	Ik siet gewoan en die neat.
Do not go through the city.	Gean net troch de stêd.
Something happened.	Der is wat bard.
And would really like to have one.	En soe echt graach ien hawwe.
What will become of us?	Wat sil der fan ús wurde?
I love her so much.	Ik hâld safolle fan har.
Well, look at you now.	No, sjoch dy no.
She really talked like that.	Se hat echt sa praat.
I'm not into this for the money.	Ik bin net yn dit foar it jild.
It did not work.	It makke it net wurkje.
Just like he did.	Krekt as hy die.
For the time being.	Foar no.
The latter did it.	Dy lêste die it.
You're doing just fine.	Jo dogge it gewoan goed.
So you just have to get used to it.	Sa moatte jo der mar oan wenne.
Nice work on this !.	Moai wurk oan dit!.
Money.	Jild.
Not in the word.	Net yn it wurd.
That, of course, he has to do it.	Dat, fansels, hy moat it dwaan.
I will not see it.	Ik sil it net sjen.
I felt hurt.	Ik fielde my sear.
I must.	Ik moat.
Then you will have enough time to make.	Dan sille jo genôch tiid hawwe om te meitsjen.
I'm happy with that.	Dêr bin ik bliid mei.
It was home and would always be.	It wie thús en soe altyd wêze.
You told me.	Do hast my sein.
She knew what it was now.	Se wist wat it no wie.
Then there is the problem of children.	Dan is der it probleem fan bern.
I joined her.	Ik kaam by har yn.
He had not done what everyone else in his life had done.	Hy hie net dien wat elkenien yn syn libben dien hie.
I'll take her.	Ik sil har nimme.
Say nothing.	Neat sizze.
And it was just so beautiful.	En it wie gewoan sa moai.
He in the movie was very happy.	Hy yn 'e film wie tige bliid.
He has been doing this for two years.	Dat docht er al twa jier.
He had no chance.	Hy hie gjin kâns.
It was so different and beautiful.	It wie sa oars en moai.
We need to have more than that.	Wy moatte mear hawwe as dat.
I can no longer stand it.	Ik kin it net mear oan.
Everything is going well so far.	Alles giet goed oant no ta.
I would agree with that.	Dêr soe ik it mei iens wêze.
He told himself that this was his job.	Hy fertelde himsels dat dit syn wurk wie.
It was just there.	It wie der gewoan.
But maybe they don’t.	Mar miskien dogge se dat net.
Go now.	Gean no.
But how can this be done well?	Mar hoe kin dit goed dwaan?
You've been so busy.	Do hast it sa drok west.
A woman's place is in the house.	It plak fan in frou is yn it hûs.
That's her whole life.	Dat is har hiele libben.
Ken told you this.	Ken fertelde dy dit.
I know exactly how he loves you.	Ik wit krekt hoe't hy fan dy hâlde.
I just do not know why a guy would say that.	Ik wit gewoan net wêrom in keardel dat sizze soe.
A little hope, perhaps.	In bytsje hope, miskien.
It's what he loves.	It is wat hy hâldt.
Either way can work.	Beide manier kin wurkje.
They want to know what we are doing.	Se wolle witte wat wy dogge.
But they have not yet.	Mar se hawwe noch net.
Another problem.	Noch in probleem.
There was absolutely none.	Der wie hielendal gjinien.
Nobody lives here now.	Hjir wennet no gjinien.
Hold on to nothing.	Hâld op neat.
Today is not that day.	Hjoed is dy dei net.
We should have both.	Wy moatte beide hawwe.
It was a few years ago.	It wie in pear jier lyn.
The first is that there are so few.	De earste is dat d'r sa'n bytsje binne.
Maybe this is the first.	Miskien is dit de earste.
You have our good.	Do hast ús goed.
And that is true.	En dat is wier.
I do not know if that tells us anything.	Ik wit net oft dat ús wat seit.
The woman went on to eat.	De frou gie troch nei it iten.
I tried and both did the same thing.	Ik besocht en beide diene itselde ding.
But this year it would be different.	Mar dit jier soe it oars wêze.
And that's too little.	En dat is te min.
It's my hair.	It is myn hier.
You are my everything.	Do bist myn alles.
He gave everything.	Hy joech alles.
Does not matter now.	Makket der no net út.
All she was.	Alles wat se wie.
I did not know her very well.	Ik koe har net sa goed.
She knew what she was saying.	Se wist wat se die.
We'll be back soon.	Wy komme gau werom.
I can never come back here.	Ik kin hjir noait werom komme.
We're on a bed.	Wy binne op in bêd.
It's just that it's home.	It is gewoan dat it thús is.
If you do not, everyone will be able to tell.	As jo ​​​​net, sil elkenien it kinne fertelle.
Something will soon come your way.	Der komt gau wat op 'e wei nei dy.
Whoever needs it will not find it.	Wa't it nedich hat, sil it net fine.
It was so many things.	It wie safolle dingen.
Let me show you.	Lit my dy sjen litte.
Maybe in another class.	Miskien yn in oare klasse.
Of course, this is by no means the only problem.	Fansels is dit lang net it ienige probleem.
If it came that way.	As it sa kaam.
Questions?	Fragen?
This guy took his time with this guy here.	Dizze keardel naam syn tiid mei dizze jonge hjir.
But none of that was ever up to us.	Mar neat fan dat wie oait oan ús.
A very good maybe.	In hiel goed miskien.
I do not know what would have happened without it.	Ik wit net wat der sûnder bard wêze soe.
But it must be said.	Mar it moat sein wurde.
He did not like to eat at all.	Hy like hielendal net te iten.
He was a good friend.	Hy wie in goede freon.
Just be there.	Wês der gewoan.
That's what we need to do.	Dat is wat wy moatte dwaan.
It goes on and on.	It giet troch en troch.
Works really well.	Wurket echt goed.
This made many people angry.	Dit makke in protte minsken lilk.
We have to get out of here.	Wy moatte hjir wei.
Since he came back, you need to see something different.	Sûnt hy werom kaam, moatte jo wat oars sjen.
Not only this.	Net allinnich dit.
I know, neither do I.	Ik wit it, ik ek net.
He did have a book.	Hy hie wol in boek.
I never try it.	Ik besykje it noait.
There would be no talking.	Der soe net praat wurde.
He was afraid he would stay home.	Hy wie bang, dat hy bleau thús.
They no longer needed it.	Se hiene it net mear nedich.
Somehow you will know about these things again.	Op ien of oare manier sille jo fan dizze dingen wer witte.
He liked him very much.	Hy mocht him tige.
If anyone can, then you are it.	As immen kin, dan binne jo it.
Now think about the other things.	Tink no oer de oare dingen.
I never really worked with him.	Ik haw noait echt mei him wurke.
Whatever you do, do not show your wife any of these.	Wat jo ek dogge, lit jo frou net ien fan dizze sjen.
So they do what they can.	Sa dogge se wat se kinne.
And it's nothing more than that.	En it is neat mear as dat.
It was not difficult.	It wie net dreech.
This is the same for humans.	Dit is itselde foar minsken.
I see nothing but good from all this.	Ik sjoch neat oars as goed fan dit alles.
If you have an idea, please let us know.	As jo ​​​​in idee hawwe, lit it ús dan witte.
I tried.	Ik besocht.
He needs us as much as we need him.	Hy hat ús safolle nedich as wy him nedich hawwe.
But so, he hopes.	Mar soe, hope er.
she says.	seit se.
Could not have asked for more.	Koe net hawwe frege om mear.
Tell her it's me.	Fertel har dat it ik bin.
Someone got a picture of it.	Immen krige dêr in foto fan.
It was not ready.	It wie net klear.
I had no idea who or where I was going.	Ik hie gjin idee wa't of wêr't ik hinne moast.
I just lived in it.	Ik wenne der gewoan yn.
He was never quite sure why.	Hy wie noait hielendal wis wêrom.
But that is not so true.	Mar dat is sa net wier.
I entered her.	Ik kaam har yn.
I buy you everything you want.	Ik keapje jo alles wat jo wolle.
I had heard that the food was good.	Ik hie heard dat it iten goed wie.
So, it is.	Sa, it is.
Whatever they do, they do it together.	Wat se ek dogge, se dogge it tegearre.
There is nothing to do, nothing to do.	Der is neat te dwaan, neat te dwaan.
The dog will not eat his food.	De hûn sil syn iten net ite.
She will find you.	Se sil dy fine.
Now my problem is this.	No is myn probleem dit.
Can't wait to see it ready.	Kin net wachtsje om it klear te sjen.
That's just too much to see here.	Dat is hjir gewoan te folle om te sjen.
He goes up and up.	Hy giet op en op.
She tried, but she could not speak.	Se besocht, mar se koe net prate.
But he is not.	Mar hy is net.
Said they would never come for us, not now.	Sei dat se noait foar ús komme soene, net no.
Well, look at this.	No, sjoch nei dizze.
He does his job.	Hy docht syn wurk.
Think about it.	Tink der wat oer.
Can't do it.	Kin it net dwaan.
Maybe not all of them.	Miskien net allegear.
There was also a woman.	Dêr wie ek in frou.
She was long gone.	Se wie lang fuort.
The big thing is to be different, he says.	It grutte ding is oars te wêzen, seit er.
And he would tell me.	En hy soe it my fertelle.
These could not be found.	Dy koene net fûn wurde.
I did a lot of good for people.	Ik die in protte goed foar minsken.
You can not do everything.	Jo kinne net alles dwaan.
No one is happy.	Nimmen is bliid.
It does not matter if they agree or not, we will win.	It makket net út oft se it iens binne of net, wy sille winne.
Be open and wait to find out more about people.	Wês iepen en wachtsje om mear te finen oer minsken.
Where or when, we do not know.	Wêr of wannear, wy witte net.
I'm still trying to figure out what that might be.	Ik besykje noch út te finen wat dat wêze kin.
We're going to the lake tomorrow.	Wy geane moarn nei de mar.
He never went through with it.	Hy gie der noait mei troch.
I left them there.	Ik liet se der oan.
My thoughts are with her family.	Myn gedachten binne by har famylje.
Someone has to be the person who does not.	Immen moat de persoan wêze dy't dat net docht.
I could handle it.	Ik koe it oan.
It's hard to take.	It is dreech om te nimmen.
I saw the truth.	Ik seach de wierheid.
We did not know what we would find.	Wy wisten net wat wy fine soene.
We've seen a lot of this problem lately.	Wy hawwe de lêste tiid in protte fan dit probleem sjoen.
You will get mine.	Jo sille jo myn krije.
I was really interested.	Ik wie echt ynteressearre.
You go too.	Jo geane ek.
She could tell me what she would do for her first.	Se koe my fertelle wat se earst foar har dwaan soe.
As would be expected.	As soe wurde ferwachte.
We are waiting for you, if you want.	Wy wachtsje op jo, as jo wolle.
I'm trying to do the same thing.	Ik besykje itselde ding te dwaan.
Maybe it never will.	Miskien sil it noait.
Nobody wants to be that guy.	Nimmen wol dy keardel wêze.
But he could see.	Mar hy koe sjen.
I want nothing more than a family with you.	Ik wol neat mear as in famylje mei dy.
She was clearly not happy with me.	Se wie dúdlik net bliid mei my.
He's been gone too long.	Hy is al te lang fuort.
But he could not think about it anymore.	Mar hy koe der net mear oer tinke.
It went on until there was nothing left.	It gie troch oant der neat mear oer wie.
Quite simply, there is no way to do it.	Hiel gewoan, d'r is gjin manier om it te dwaan.
Of course, his class was late.	Fansels wie syn klasse let út.
He did not know about that.	Dêr wist er net fan.
But woman says it has to go.	Mar frou seit dat it moat gean.
I think he was sitting in there.	Ik tink dat hy der yn siet.
He does not say anything.	Hy seit net wat.
I have decided.	Ik haw my besletten.
He had found that the first day they met.	Hy hie dat fûn de earste dei dat se moete.
Something just happened, and he wants to tell me.	Der is krekt wat bard, en hy wol it my fertelle.
There is very little food to be had.	Der is hiel min iten te hawwen.
I have something to do.	Ik haw wat te dwaan.
I looked at him.	Ik seach him oan.
But that is different.	Mar dy is oars.
Very sure he will have a good read.	Hiel wis dat hy in goed lêzen sil hawwe.
Be very very good.	Wês heul heul goed.
Who lives here?	Wa wennet hjir?
No time.	Gjin tiid.
It was nice though.	It wie wol aardich.
I know more than you.	Ik wit mear as jo.
Now it was once.	No wie it eartiids.
Then there would be no question.	Dan soe der gjin fraach wêze.
We just have to stay in the car.	Wy moatte mar yn 'e auto bliuwe.
She looks up at me quickly, without a word.	Se sjocht my gau op, sûnder in wurd.
One month became a year.	Ien moanne waard in jier.
I have not heard it before.	Ik haw it noch net earder heard.
That, it was not just about money.	Dat, it gie net allinnich oer jild.
Do this over a large bowl.	Doch dit oer in grutte kom.
How you do this is up to you.	Hoe't jo dit dogge is oan jo.
There have only been a few.	Der binne mar in pear west.
He did not want to stop.	Hy woe net ophâlde.
And you too.	En do ek.
Even if you said it was okay.	Sels as jo seine dat it goed wie.
Here it goes well.	Hjir giet it goed.
Only for you.	Allinnich foar dy.
That's how it's done.	Dat is hoe't it dien is.
Are you sure you will not tell him.	Binne jo wis dat jo sille net fertelle him.
Everything, everything, that's what we're here for.	Alles, alles, dêr binne wy ​​hjir foar.
I believe things happen for a reason.	Ik leau dat dingen barre foar in reden.
That if he did that, that would.	Dat as hy dat die, dat soe.
You are not trying too hard.	Jo besykje net te hurd.
A photo of a woman.	In foto fan in frou.
What would you do if you received this money?	Wat soene jo dwaan as jo dit jild krije?
We are now in one.	Wy binne no yn ien.
I did not know that.	Dat wist ik net.
What went wrong ?.	Wat gie der ferkeard?.
We talked about you.	Wy hiene it oer dy.
What will people think of you?	Wat sille minsken fan dy tinke?
But it was really all very giving and taking.	Mar it wie echt allegear heul jaan en nimme.
The young man was not happy about what had happened.	De jonge man wie net bliid oer wat der bard wie.
I have nothing to talk to you about.	Ik haw neat mei dy te praten.
I like it a bit, but not really.	Ik haw it sa'n bytsje, mar net echt.
And you can do that.	En jo kinne dat dwaan.
I did not come to class yet.	Ik kaam noch net yn 'e klasse.
He was never too late.	Hy wie nea te let.
But these concerns may be a thing of the past.	Mar dizze soargen kinne in ding fan it ferline wêze.
Then see what happens.	Sjoch dan wat der bart.
If they had asked him how it felt.	As se him frege hiene hoe't it fielde.
It was just bad.	It wie gewoan min.
This is her home.	Dit is har thús.
But no one knows any of this.	Mar gjinien wit wat fan dit.
Make that was.	Meitsje dat wie.
Nothing can ever scare me.	Neat kin my ea bang meitsje.
He was a teacher at my school.	Hy wie learaar op myn skoalle.
You have given me much more than you think you have.	Jo hawwe my folle mear jûn as jo tinke dat jo hawwe.
You know where we're going.	Jo witte wêr't wy hinne geane.
You are here to help her.	Jo binne hjir om har te helpen.
We do things together about that dog we visit.	Wy dogge tegearre dingen oer dy hûn dy't wy besykje.
Everyone had something to say about it.	Elkenien hie der wat oer te sizzen.
I know she does.	Ik wit dat se docht.
Please keep them coming.	Hâld se asjebleaft komme.
And, they did.	En, dat diene se.
Which she apparently can not do with me.	Wat se nei alle gedachten net mei my dwaan kin.
This man.	Dizze man .
There was no one there.	Dêr wie net ien.
My kids need to eat.	Myn bern moatte ite.
But he was so scared.	Mar hy wie wol sa bang.
He looked around.	Hy seach om him hinne.
Let them go.	Lit se gean.
I could not let that happen.	Ik koe dat net barre litte.
See it my way.	Sjoch it op myn manier.
And nice if you were nice.	En moai as jo aardich wiene.
But he does get over it.	Mar hy komt der wol oer.
I have to go.	Ik moat fuort.
that I will try.	dat sil ik besykje.
They are also not in a better place.	Se binne ek net op in better plak.
Not a good place to be.	Net in goed plak om te wêzen.
I have so many questions about this.	Ik haw safolle fragen oer dit.
It was the same for me at school.	It wie foar my itselde op skoalle.
Friends were through work.	Freonen wiene troch it wurk.
Probably he expected her to do the same.	Wierskynlik ferwachte er dat se itselde soe dwaan.
I love a lot of things.	Ik hâld fan in protte dingen.
Wish them well if they want more children.	Winskje se goed as se mear bern wolle.
That's pretty clear.	Dat is frij dúdlik.
I wanted to be.	Ik woe wurde.
Can do anything.	Kin alles dwaan.
This is also wrong.	Dit is ek ferkeard.
He walked to the door.	Hy rûn nei de doar.
He had seen it before.	Hy hie it earder sjoen.
I take this.	Ik nim dizze.
No one else will talk to you.	Nimmen oars sil mei dy prate.
And all his friends.	En al syn freonen.
Give, give, give.	Jou, jaan, jaan.
He took her hand.	Hy naam har hân.
They will be hard pressed to get that.	Se sille dreech wurde om dat te krijen.
I'm fine with that.	Ik bin der goed mei.
After the party.	Nei it feest.
There are two more.	Der binne noch twa mear.
But, boy, he made you.	Mar, jonge, hy hat dy makke.
If you can not see it, ask.	As jo ​​​​dat net sjen kinne, freegje dan.
I do not know where he has them in his hand.	Ik wit net wêr't er har yn 'e hân hat.
But it is not to be.	Mar it is net te wêzen.
Give her time, she's going to die.	Jou har tiid, se komt om.
Please look at the photo.	Sjoch asjebleaft nei de foto.
I'm sure she would like it.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se it leuk fine soe.
It was not his thing.	It wie net syn ding.
The weekend is too long.	It wykein is te lang.
The meeting should not have happened.	De gearkomste hie net barre moatten.
Which was nice.	Wat moai wie.
Let me think a little more about this.	Lit my hjir wat mear oer tinke.
She does not like us.	Se hâldt net fan ús.
And those who did not know it, have long talked about it.	En dy't it net wisten, dy hawwe der lang oer praat.
I will be pretty happy to come home.	Ik sil aardich bliid wêze om thús te kommen.
But there was more to it than that.	Mar der wie mear oan as dat.
The big one.	De grutte.
It was not necessary.	It wie net nedich.
See what he did.	Sjoch wat er dien hat.
I wish you did not.	Ik winskje dat jo dat net dogge.
And we hope you come back.	En wy hoopje dat jo werom komme.
I'm just a few days away.	Ik bin krekt in pear dagen fuort.
Really need help with this.	Echt help nedich mei dizze.
Maybe a little.	Miskien in bytsje.
Many people want to help everyone.	In protte minsken wolle elkenien helpe.
I have no girl.	Ik haw gjin famke.
They might not have said anything.	Se soene miskien neat sein hawwe.
But they do not tell us everything.	Mar se fertelle ús net alles.
There has to be a better way.	Der moat in bettere manier wêze.
She had to see it for herself.	Se moast it sels sjen.
Her friend is coming home soon.	Har freon komt gau thús.
I'm afraid to talk to him back.	Ik bin bang om mei him werom te praten.
This man does not.	Dizze man net.
I have to do what they tell me to do.	Ik moat dwaan wat se my sizze te dwaan.
I have a better idea.	Ik haw in better idee.
Everyone had something on their job to address their concerns.	Elkenien hie wat op har wurk om har soargen oer te meitsjen.
I do not know why he did this, but it looked really good.	Ik wit net wêrom hy dit die, mar it seach der echt goed út.
I can not wait with you.	Ik kin net mei dy wachtsje.
Now he saw some worries.	No seach er wat soargen.
But that just can not be.	Mar dat kin gewoan net.
But she was not on time.	Mar se wie net op tiid.
But no more than one.	Mar net mear as ien.
I have not done that yet.	Dat haw ik noch net dien.
You do not seem happy to see me.	Jo lykje net bliid om my te sjen.
It can help if you need it.	It kin helpe as jo it nedich hawwe.
Or do the other thing.	Of it oare ding dwaan.
We work hard.	Wy wurkje hurd.
He did not like it.	Hy like it net.
My husband liked it.	Myn man fûn it leuk.
He should join them.	Hy soe der by har yn moatte.
We had nothing to eat.	Wy hiene neat te iten.
There had been even more to ride.	Der hie noch mear te riden west.
Then this cop can do whatever he wants.	Dan kin dizze plysje dwaan wat er wol.
And no one is told what he is working on.	En nimmen wurdt ferteld wêr't er oan wurket.
You do it again.	Jo dogge it wer.
It had started well enough.	It wie goed genôch begûn.
It's not really for kids.	It is net echt foar bern.
We all say we want to be good.	Wy sizze allegear dat wy goed wêze wolle.
That's what I'll be doing this weekend.	Dat sil ik dit wykein dwaan.
I should have seen it earlier.	Ik hie it earder sjen moatten.
Let's find another way.	Litte wy in oare manier fine.
The police, he loves the police.	De plysje, hy hâldt fan de plysje.
None of that matters.	Gjin fan dat makket neat.
She got tired too easily.	Se waard te maklik wurch.
And he also knew where he lived.	En hy wist ek wêr't er wenne.
Everyone wants money.	Elkenien wol jild.
Let us first see why.	Lit ús earst sjen wêrom.
I do not agree with that.	Ik bin it der net mei iens.
And then the woman.	En dan de frou.
We find otherwise.	Wy fine oars.
From your place.	Fan dyn plak.
Well, that's exactly what it is.	No, dat is krekt wat it is.
It will be different now.	It sil no oars.
I could not pay it.	Ik koe it net betelje.
The water sat over.	It wetter siet oer.
But not so.	Mar net sa.
I was happy for her.	Ik wie bliid foar har.
I was glad to see him.	Ik wie bliid om him te sjen.
That's what's happening here.	Dat is wat hjir bart.
This was what she wanted.	Dit wie wat se woe.
Nothing would be easy.	Neat soe maklik wêze.
I wish much that could not be.	Ik winskje folle dat kin net wêze.
This door will open.	Dizze doar sil iepen.
I'm at school.	Ik bin op skoalle.
And after a few more days you would see one more.	En nei noch in pear dagen soene jo noch ien sjen.
Tell me.	Fertel my.
That's exactly how I felt.	Dat fielde ik krekt.
Her children were angry.	Har bern wiene lilk.
Who knows, it might work.	Wa wit kin it wurkje.
They are given it.	Se wurde it jûn.
You ask yourself.	Jo freegje jo ôf.
You might as well get used to it.	Jo kinne der ek wol oan wenne.
It's a great job.	It is in grutte baan.
He was not home last night.	Hy wie fannacht net thús.
Lots to do.	In protte te dwaan.
See you soon!.	Oant gau!.
I found them.	Ik haw se fûn.
There is an office open next week.	Der is nije wike in kantoar iepen.
Not one came out.	Net ien kaam út.
I will eat his children.	Ik sil syn bern ite.
Just as long as you are not here to cause trouble.	Krekt sa lang as jo hjir net binne om problemen te meitsjen.
You get us through this.	Jo krije ús troch dit.
He should be worried.	Hy soe soargen wêze moatte.
You do not even know who you are.	Jo witte net iens wa't jo binne.
Do not buy too much.	Keapje net te folle.
That was what it was.	Dat wie wat it wie.
We have to be careful.	Wy moatte foarsichtich wêze.
It looked too good.	It seach der te goed út.
It seems like that should be the problem.	It liket derop dat dat it probleem wêze moat.
You've never heard of it.	Jo hawwe it noait heard.
I'm not ready that way.	Ik bin sa net klear.
It looks very different from the first picture.	It sjocht der hiel oars út as de earste foto.
Think about how it went, year in, year out.	Tink oan hoe't it gie, jier yn, jier út.
They did not.	Dat diene se net.
She was not ready for bed yet.	Se wie noch net klear foar bêd.
The work was done.	It wurk wie dien.
It's just there.	It is der gewoan.
I do not know what.	Ik wit net wat.
I had to see her.	Ik moast har sjen.
I'm having a hard time with anything.	Ik haw it dreech mei wat.
There he was again.	Dêr wie er wer.
I was still in school.	Ik siet noch op skoalle.
That should help you.	Dat moat dy helpe.
He soon heard of it.	Hy hearde der al gau fan.
Still, probably better that way.	Noch, wierskynlik better op dy manier.
We will never know.	Dat sille wy nea witte.
They are long gone.	Se binne al lang fuort.
He loves you very, very much.	Hy hâldt fan dy hiel, hiel folle.
It can only be one day in life.	It kin mar in dei yn it libben wêze.
I do not think he had much.	Ik tink net dat er folle hie.
He has not been the same dog since.	Hy hat sûnt net deselde hûn west.
Until this year.	Oant dit jier.
My life would no longer be my life.	Myn libben soe myn libben net mear wêze.
But this is it.	Mar dit is it.
I do not know what I am doing wrong.	Ik wit net wat ik ferkeard doch.
We'm going through, that's fine.	Wy geane troch, dat is goed.
It was last year.	It wie ferline jier.
Everyone was scared.	Elkenien wie bang.
You can probably do better.	Jo kinne wierskynlik better dwaan.
I'm not a mother either.	Ik bin ek gjin mem.
There was that word again.	Dêr wie dat wurd wer.
I do not want to go back to school.	Ik wol net werom nei skoalle.
It could be something else.	It kin wol wat oars.
She did not ask which one.	Se frege net hokker.
She always had something to eat.	Se hat altyd wat te iten hân.
It's good to be back.	It is goed om werom te wêzen.
He wants to do some things, but not too much.	Hy wol wat dingen dwaan, mar net te folle.
I'll find you where you can go.	Ik sil dy fine wêr't jo hinne kinne.
It seems to have worked.	It liket wurke te hawwen.
But somehow it did.	Mar op ien of oare manier die it.
He was glad he could help her.	Hy wie bliid dat er har helpe koe.
Do not ask me why.	Freegje my net wêrom.
This happened today.	Dit is hjoed bard.
I do not want it, you can have it.	Ik wol it net, jo kinne it hawwe.
An opportunity.	In kâns.
You should have been here hours ago.	Do hiest hjir oeren lyn wêze moatten.
This was all very well and everyone was happy.	Dit wie allegear hiel goed en elkenien wie bliid.
Try to make sure they get on them.	Besykje te meitsjen dat se op har komme.
Never sat in there.	Nea siet der yn.
You will not find it here!	Jo sille it hjir net fine!
It was the same for all of us.	It wie foar ús allegear itselde.
But do something.	Mar wat dwaan.
You come with us.	Jo komme mei ús.
She left the following week.	Se gie de folgjende wike fuort.
He hoped there would be a job.	Hy hope dat der in baan soe komme.
I'll tell you the truth.	Ik sil dy de wierheid fertelle.
Creating a city	It meitsjen fan in stêd
He went to work.	Hy gie nei it wurk.
I will wait.	Ik sil wachtsje.
I only came back for that.	Dêr kaam ik allinnich foar werom.
It is not.	It is net.
I have to go now.	Ik moat no gean.
Nothing comes out.	Der komt neat út.
He's scared of the old man.	Hy is bang foar de âld man.
She told me everything.	Se fertelde my alles.
Think about it one more time.	Tink der noch ien kear oan.
There's still time for you to leave.	D'r is noch tiid foar jo om fuort te gean.
You know what time it is for children.	Jo witte hoe't tiid is foar bern.
She looked away.	Se seach fuort.
I should let him go first.	Ik soe him earst gean litte moatte.
I'll leave you there.	Ik sil dy der oan litte.
He had nothing left.	Hy hie neat mear oer.
It just is not.	It is gewoan net.
He will take care of you.	Hy sil foar dy soargje.
We had no idea what we were doing.	Wy hiene gjin idee wat wy diene.
Do not be afraid.	Wês net bang.
Of course that's just.	Fansels die se net.
He took the letter.	Hy naam it brief.
Maybe want more.	Miskien wol mear.
I did not even have a name.	Ik hie net iens in namme.
His father, for one.	Syn heit, foar ien.
We had no idea who he was.	Wy hiene gjin idee wa't hy wie.
He should not be here, he should not be here.	Hy soe hjir net wêze moatte, hy soe hjir net iens wêze moatte.
It goes on.	It giet oan.
In other words, it could.	Mei oare wurden, it koe.
I went that weekend.	Ik gie dat wykein.
Have not seen this before.	Haw dit net earder sjoen.
It's what you do or not.	It is wat jo dogge of net.
He can take it.	Hy kin it nimme.
I had no idea where she could be.	Ik hie gjin idee wêr't se wêze koe.
So far I have one.	Oant no ta haw ik ien.
He should never have done that before.	Hy hie dat noch nea dwaan moatten.
There is no getting around it.	Der is gjin komme om it.
I need to talk to her.	Ik moat mei har prate.
Are you sure you want to view this?	Binne jo wis dat jo dit sjen wolle?
This child was her being.	Dit bern wie har wêzen.
I might as well be on the road.	Ik kin wol op 'e wei wêze.
We do not know why.	Wy witte net wêrom.
It was not a question, it was not a question.	It wie gjin fraach, it wie gjin fraach.
He is there a lot for us.	Hy is dêr in protte foar ús.
We need to stop being afraid.	Wy moatte ophâlde te wêzen bang.
She does not want me there.	Se wol my dêr net.
I do not know too much about him.	Ik wit net al te folle oer him.
It is not so.	It is net sa.
I did not know why or how.	Ik wist net wêrom of hoe.
One other guy was there with his wife.	Ien oare keardel wie dêr mei syn frou.
They show.	Se litte sjen.
She was pretty angry about it.	Se wie der aardich lilk om.
Ask someone who would know.	Freegje immen dy't soe witte.
That was not easy to do.	Dat wie net maklik om te dwaan.
Of course, he did not know what to do.	Fansels, hy wist net wat te dwaan.
What you want is what you will do.	Wat jo wolle is wat jo sille dwaan.
Not one of us will.	Net ien fan ús sil.
I want to think about nothing.	Ik wol oer neat tinke.
She has no reason to be afraid of him.	Se hat gjin reden om bang foar him te wêzen.
He does not worry me now, but he has a past.	Hy makket my no gjin soargen, mar hy hat in ferline.
But I do.	Mar ik doch.
They are now a family.	Se binne no in famylje.
These things happen, you do not have to worry about them.	Dizze dingen barre, meitsje jo der gjin soargen oer.
We do not know much about them.	Wy witte net folle oer har.
I would love to have her new book.	Ik soe har nije boek graach hawwe.
Even more with children.	Noch mear mei bern.
Come on, we have work to do.	Kom op, wy hawwe wurk te dwaan.
She was not a little happy to see me.	Se wie net in bytsje bliid om my te sjen.
I was late.	Ik kaam te let.
You sure do not want to.	Jo wis dat jo net wolle.
She touched his hand.	Se rekke syn hân oan.
But we have to do the work.	Mar wy moatte it wurk dwaan.
It was almost done.	It wie hast dien.
There was no going back.	Der wie gjin werom mear.
She comes through.	Se komt troch.
I could not even find you at first.	Ik koe dy earst net iens fine.
This will not be otherwise.	Dit sil net oars.
But he was not found.	Mar hy waard net fûn.
I do not have a car.	Ik haw gjin auto.
We had never been enough for her.	Wy hiene nea genôch west foar har.
But it gave her nothing.	Mar it joech har neat.
A very pretty girl, actually.	In hiel moai famke, eins.
She did not seem bothered.	Se like har net dreech.
Other times maybe !.	Oare kear miskien!.
I was not scared at first.	Ik wie earst net bang.
My father came out.	Myn heit kaam út.
I'm surprised she knows my name.	Ik bin ferrast dat se myn namme wit.
I really like it.	Ik hâld der echt fan.
Plenty of.	In protte.
I will make it happen in time.	Ik sil it barre yn 'e tiid.
This week it was decided for me.	Dizze wike is it foar my besletten.
It could be so much more.	It kin safolle mear.
If you have any concerns, please let me know.	As jo ​​soargen hawwe, lit it my dan witte.
Since then we play together.	Sûnt dy tiid spylje wy tegearre.
I put it off long enough.	Ik sette it lang genôch út.
I wanted to do it.	Ik woe it dwaan.
They both talked about it.	Se hiene it der beide oer.
It was very clear.	It wie hiel dúdlik.
This was my office.	Dit wie myn kantoar.
I'm worried about her now.	Ik meitsje my no soargen oer har.
My mother lived here.	Myn mem wenne hjir.
He was sick worried about her.	Hy wie siik soargen oer har.
It was early in the year.	It wie betiid yn it jier.
We have to win.	Wy moatte winne.
And then you go to work.	En dan geane jo oan it wurk.
She's a friend of mine.	Se is in freon fan my.
It seems like more than hours.	It liket mear as oeren.
We did it all morning.	Wy diene it fan 'e moarn allegear.
That was not good.	Dat wie net goed.
This is just before you do it.	Dit is krekt foardat jo dat dogge.
Just do it.	Doch it gewoan.
So it had been.	Sa hie it west.
They can do even better.	Se kinne sels better.
Real thing, they decided.	Echt ding, besletten se.
I had that chance.	Ik hie dy kâns.
We did not tell her that we got her for her.	Wy hawwe har net ferteld dat wy se foar har krigen hawwe.
There was nothing to see.	Der wie neat te sjen.
You can say anything.	Jo kinne alles sizze.
I went back to his office.	Ik gie werom nei syn kantoar.
You can tell people let's do something about this, help me.	Jo kinne minsken fertelle litte wy hjir wat oan dwaan, help my.
All of it.	Hielendal fan it.
We are not there yet.	Wy binne der noch net.
That really can not be otherwise.	Dat kin eins net oars.
It's been a lot.	It is in protte west.
Well, then.	No, dan.
he says.	hy seit.
Neither.	Gjin fan beide.
She said not a word.	Se sei gjin wurd.
You know they're in there for the money.	Jo witte dat se der yn binne foar it jild.
And great opportunity.	En grutte kâns.
But the old man did not want to leave it.	Mar de âld man woe it net litte.
It worked.	It wurke.
She is done for.	Se is dien foar.
It's all here in this letter.	It is hjir allegear yn dizze brief.
Food is the best thing.	Iten is it bêste ding.
He looked like a nice man.	Hy like in aardich man.
He wanted to get back to bed.	Hy woe wer op bêd.
He's not very tall.	Hy is net hiel lang.
It would not be difficult.	It soe net dreech wêze.
Or to put it another way.	Of om it oars te sizzen.
A man walked to the car.	In man rûn nei de auto ta.
We are clear about that.	Dêr binne wy ​​dúdlik oer.
Maybe there was none of it.	Miskien wie der neat fan.
I think you were not there.	Ik tink dat jo der net wiene.
But I want something different.	Mar ik wol oars.
It's not real enough.	It is net genôch echt.
On a weekend.	Op in wykein.
This is very clear.	Dit is heul dúdlik.
I had not asked for her.	Ik hie net nei har frege.
That's what everyone said.	Dat sei elkenien.
It has only happened once.	It is mar ien kear bard.
Not this way.	Net dizze manier.
To me, they look the same.	Foar my lykje se itselde.
He wondered how old she was.	Hy frege him ôf hoe âld se wie.
It works very well.	It wurket hiel goed.
He put himself back.	Hy sette him werom.
I wanted to be someone.	Ik woe immen wêze.
This time she's talking to us about it.	Dizze kear hat se it der mei ús oer.
Everything clear here.	Alles dúdlik hjir.
Very nice, he said.	Hiel moai, sei er.
Waiting for you.	Wachtsje op dy.
See what we have done here.	Sjoch wat wy hjir dien hawwe.
The children have to go back to school.	De bern moatte werom nei skoalle.
No problems here.	Gjin problemen hjir.
She gave it her all.	Se joech it alles.
The mother of the house.	De mem fan it hûs.
And sort of not.	En soarte fan net.
We'll just have to see.	Wy sille mar sjen moatte.
This one here is just for people.	Dizze hjir is gewoan foar minsken.
I thought of nothing else.	Ik tocht oan neat oars.
And here she was at it.	En hjir wie se it op.
We had two new kids alone in our class.	Wy hiene twa nije bern allinnich yn ús klasse.
But he was already ready.	Mar hy wie al klear.
She had nothing to do with it.	Dêr hie se neat oan.
Let me know what day you found this.	Lit my witte hokker dei jo dit fûn hawwe.
That's all well and good.	Dat is allegear goed en goed.
Wait, maybe not one of you.	Wachtsje, miskien net ien fan dy.
With good reason too.	Mei goede reden ek.
But not easy.	Mar net maklik.
Now his dr.	No syn dr.
Time to do something.	Tiid om wat te dwaan.
I have parents.	Ik haw âlden.
She had asked that morning.	Se hie dy moarn frege.
I had to go through it for whatever reason.	Ik moast der troch gean om hokker reden dan ek.
Maybe she was just tired.	Miskien wie se gewoan wurch.
Food is not a concern for me.	Iten is gjin soargen foar my.
Three things happened today.	Der binne hjoed trije dingen bard.
She was sure there would be a party.	Se wie der wis fan dat der in feest wêze soe.
It needs to be done.	It moat dien wurde.
What he himself wanted.	Wat er sels woe.
To talk to you.	Om mei dy te praten.
There is no going back.	Der is gjin wei werom.
See what you believe.	Sjoch wat jo leauwe.
There are many things we can do.	D'r binne in protte dingen dy't wy kinne dwaan.
There was no one else.	Der wie gjinien oars.
I let him take the car.	Ik liet him de auto nimme.
This was more like that of a house.	Dit like mear op dat fan in hûs.
You have to play against each other.	Jo moatte spylje tsjin elkoar.
He has to go now.	Hy moat no gean.
It had to be done.	It moast dien wurde.
No one ever knows the truth.	Nimmen wit de wierheid ea.
I opened the book.	Ik die it boek iepen.
People need to be told.	Minsken moatte wurde ferteld.
There was another old man too.	Der wie ek in oare âld man.
Now there was something to look forward to.	No wie der wat om nei út te sjen.
I never knew.	Ik wist it noait.
I've never seen anyone there before.	Ik haw dêr noch noait gjinien sjoen.
And that's just not true.	En dat is gewoan net wier.
It says exactly what it needs to say.	It seit krekt wat it moat sizze.
A good idea during that time that got even better.	In goed idee yn dy tiid dat noch better waard.
He looked like an old man to me.	Hy like my in âld man.
This child is sick.	Dit bern is siik.
She will be there anyway.	Se sil der wol wêze.
It was one of those days.	It wie ien fan dy dagen.
That's gone.	Dat is fuort.
I just have not been.	Ik bin gewoan net west.
And the woman.	En de frou.
Her hand was in his hair.	Har hân wie yn syn hier.
They will not let me.	Se sille my net litte litte.
There is nothing more to say.	Der is neat mear te sizzen.
Or something else with a name on it.	Of wat oars mei in namme derop.
Not much.	Net in protte.
It will not stop.	It sil net ophâlde.
And then he wants to take a chance.	En dan wol er graach in kâns meitsje.
He looked happy.	Hy seach bliid.
Well, that's nice.	No, dat is moai.
They will not be there.	Se sille der net wêze.
It's sure people are worried.	It is wis dat minsken binne soargen.
I asked what it was and he never told me.	Ik frege wat it wie en hy hat my noait ferteld.
No one is interested in the past.	Nimmen is ynteressearre yn it ferline.
I sat for another hour.	Ik siet noch in oere.
She wanted to do nothing.	Se woe neat dwaan.
She said she could not see what she was doing.	Se sei dat se net sjen koe wat se die.
I'm just not sure if that's wrong with me or not.	Ik bin gewoan net wis oft dat ferkeard fan my is of net.
He had to do that now.	Dat moast er no gean dwaan.
If you were here.	As jo ​​hjir wiene.
I'm looking at you.	Ik sjoch nei dy.
She needs to make her friends.	Se moat har freonen meitsje litte.
She would come back today.	Se soe hjoed werom komme.
It does not know where it came from.	It wit net wêr't it wei kaam.
I met my wife here.	Ik moete myn frou hjir.
There was none.	Der wie gjinien.
No one else could do that.	Nimmen oars koe dat dwaan.
It is that, of course.	It is dat, fansels.
I was not entirely surprised.	Ik wie net hielendal ferrast.
And you did.	En dat hawwe jo dien.
I go to bed again in an hour or two.	Ik gean wer in oere as twa op bêd.
And he will not.	En hy sil net.
It would take a lot of time.	It soe in protte tiid nimme.
No one comes in.	Gjinien komt yn.
Well, not this one.	No, dizze net.
Give him away.	Jou him wei.
Worried about who worked very well.	Soargen oer wa wurke hiel.
That was not it.	Dat wie it net.
They will try to get out of everything if they can.	Se sille besykje om út alles as se kinne.
Or off what it was on.	Of ôf wat it wie op.
They sure did.	Se hawwe wis.
I was convinced.	Ik wie oertsjûge.
I sat and watched her.	Ik siet en seach har.
What you say may be true.	Wat jo sizze kin wier wêze.
Maybe you were at work.	Miskien wiene jo oan it wurk.
I did not know what.	Ik wist net wat.
It could not be true, it could not be true.	It koe net wier wêze, it koe net wier wêze.
I tried to talk to her.	Ik besocht mei har te praten.
No one should be afraid.	Nimmen moat bang wêze.
A lot happens.	Der bart in protte.
But it was still fun.	Mar it wie noch altyd leuk.
He looked at me very much.	Hy seach my tige oan.
If we have to.	As wy moatte.
Nothing was done.	Der waard neat dien.
Just ran out.	Krekt rûn út.
That was it then.	Dat wie it dan.
Clearly we have not looked hard enough.	Dúdlik hawwe wy net hurd genôch sjoen.
Did you see her today?	Hawwe jo har hjoed sjoen?
My husband bought me a new one, but it is not the same.	Myn man kocht my in nije, mar it is net itselde.
I do not know how you did it.	Ik wit net hoe't jo it dien hawwe.
This is the right time.	Dit is de goede tiid.
Well, you are not alone.	No, do bist net allinnich.
Well, here we are again.	No, hjir binne wy ​​wer.
Just met your kids.	Krekt moete dyn bern.
Whatever he would say will wait.	Wat er ek sizze soe, sil wachtsje.
It does on mine.	It docht op myn.
Make friends with other people.	Meitsje freonen mei oare minsken.
We'll see.	Wy sille sjen.
I would not doubt that.	Dêr soe ik net oan twifelje.
I just do not know what to do first.	Ik wit gewoan net wat ik earst dwaan moat.
And be ready.	En wês klear.
She would have just gone.	Se soe krekt gien wêze.
I was out and about.	Ik wie út en oer.
She can 't tell us who he is.	Se kin ús net fertelle wa't hy is.
I have something for you too.	Ik ha dy ek wat.
But it was not to be.	Mar it wie net te wêzen.
It's a good book.	It is in goed boek.
Wait it out.	Wachtsje it út.
We love other things too.	Wy hâlde ek fan oare dingen.
Go over, please.	Gean oer, asjebleaft.
Rather, we buy new ones.	Earder keapje wy nije.
But she had to be there.	Mar se moast der wêze.
He had heard enough.	Hy hie genôch heard.
His father still lives there.	Syn heit wennet dêr noch.
Come here, come here.	Kom hjir, kom hjir.
It seems to be the same this year.	It liket dit jier itselde te wêzen.
But so is he.	Mar sa is er.
I'm doing this.	Ik doch dit.
He just goes on and on.	Hy giet gewoan troch.
But do not worry.	Mar meitsje jo gjin soargen.
They always have something to say about everything.	Se hawwe altyd wat te sizzen oer alles.
We can do it, and we will do it.	Wy kinne it dwaan, en wy sille it dwaan.
People are getting old.	Minsken wurde âld.
Nobody knew what.	Nimmen wist wat.
You have a chance to do something good.	Jo hawwe in kâns om wat goed te dwaan.
Try to get here early.	Besykje hjir betiid te kommen.
But she had not been.	Mar se wie net west.
Everything that happens in your life happens for a reason.	Alles wat bart yn jo libben, bart foar in reden.
Well, whatever you say you are.	No, wat jo sizze dat jo binne.
Someone had to say it.	Immen moast it sizze.
What is the.	Wat is de.
My father has a lot of money.	Myn heit hat in protte jild.
But she did not know that.	Mar dat wist se net.
I know him, he will do nothing without.	Ik ken him, hy sil neat dwaan sûnder.
I'll be ready.	Ik sil klear wêze.
I have a better house for you.	Ik haw in better hûs foar dy.
Let me see where he is.	Lit my sjen wêr't hy is.
Then again.	Dan wer.
She took up more room than his wife.	Se naam mear keamer yn as syn frou.
That did not occur to me.	Dat kaam my net op.
Who says that?	Wa seit dat?
This was expected.	Dit waard ferwachte.
I did it twice.	Ik die it twa kear.
It was the life it did.	It wie it libben dat it die.
I'm not, but neither am I quite a man.	Ik bin net, mar ek net hielendal in man.
It's not a real animal or anything.	It is gjin echt bist of sa.
Nobody can help you.	Nimmen kin jo helpe.
It's very clear to me that you do not have that.	It is my hielendal dúdlik dat jo dat net hawwe.
Probably still.	Wierskynlik noch.
That's just my life.	Dat is gewoan myn libben.
It's like there's more than one man in me.	It is as is der mear as ien man yn my.
That's what the boy does here.	Dat docht de jonge hjir.
She seemed pretty happy with her life.	Se like aardich bliid mei har libben.
He does not do bad things.	Hy docht gjin minne dingen.
But we all know that life is not like that.	Mar wy witte allegear dat it libben net sa is.
We had talk and talk and talk.	Wy hiene praat en praat en praat.
That day is here.	Dy dei is hjir.
Hold on.	Hâld der oan.
But it's much more than that.	Mar it is folle mear as dat.
I just know he's not.	Ik wit gewoan dat hy net is.
You do not even know how it happened.	Jo witte net iens hoe't it bard is.
I'm still not sure what to do.	Ik bin noch net wis wat te dwaan.
Come with us.	Kom mei ús.
There's more money than we thought.	Der is mear jild as wy tocht hiene.
It's just not right.	It is gewoan net krekt.
This is her.	Dit is har.
How to make yours.	Hoe meitsje dyn.
They do not know they are sick today.	Se witte net dat se hjoed siik binne.
Something else could happen.	Der kin noch wat barre.
No more days.	Gjin dei mear.
You have a lot of time left.	Jo hawwe in protte tiid oer.
It does.	It docht wol.
Please let me know if anything comes to your mind.	Lit my asjebleaft witte as der wat by jo komt.
Many people believe this.	In protte minsken leauwe dit.
And you're not asking me to go back.	En jo freegje my net werom te gean.
I was there for him when he needed me.	Ik wie der foar him doe't hy my nedich hie.
And heard it again.	En hearde it wer.
He felt a little bad.	Hy fielde him wat min.
And there seems to be only one way to do that.	En d'r liket mar ien manier om dat te dwaan.
They can and do.	Se kinne en dwaan.
If she only knew.	As se it mar wist.
I thought it was really good.	Ik tocht dat it wie echt goed.
No matter who you are, or what you say,	Makket net út wa't jo binne, of wat jo sizze,
This may be true.	Dit kin wier wêze.
People work.	Minsken wurkje.
I tried to figure out what had happened.	Ik besocht út te finen wat der bard wie.
You have to wait for it.	Jo moatte der op wachtsje.
But they are not there yet.	Mar se binne der noch net.
If it was.	As it wie.
But soon enough.	Mar gau genôch.
But no one else.	Mar nimmen oars.
He told us everything.	Hy hat ús alles ferteld.
Look at this picture.	Sjoch nei dizze foto.
Nobody had to say it.	Nimmen moast it sizze.
He did this, he thinks to himself.	Hy hat dit dien, tinkt er himsels.
I'm looking forward to a day.	Ik sjoch der nei út nei in dei.
She actually came to us for help.	Se kaam eins by ús om help.
You can talk to almost anyone.	Jo kinne mei hast elkenien prate.
It did nothing for her.	It die neat foar har.
Let my other friends go.	Lit myn oare freonen gean.
It can easily be the truth.	It kin maklik de wierheid wêze.
That's what we're doing here.	Dat dogge wy hjir.
We just knew nothing else.	Wy wisten gewoan neat oars.
Sick, sick, sick.	Siik, siik, siik.
I thought he would ask.	Ik tocht dat er freegje soe.
Mar, mar, mar.	Mar, mar, mar.
Hard on him.	Hurd op him.
I will not take it either.	Ik sil it ek net nimme.
You're not ready yet.	Do bist der noch net klear.
I had none.	Ik hie gjinien.
And that was exactly what happened.	En dat wie krekt wat barde.
We know who the mother is.	Wy witte wa't de mem is.
And why wouldn’t they.	En wêrom soene se net.
I had nothing to do with it.	Ik hie der neat mei dien.
She asked him where her best friend was.	Se frege him wêr't har bêste freon wie.
Of course, do what you can.	Fansels, dwaan wat jo kinne.
Your chance will come.	Jo kâns sil komme.
Do not talk too much.	Praat net te folle.
It's just us here and nothing happened.	It binne gewoan wy hjir en neat is bard.
Can not find words easily.	Kin wurden net maklik fine.
Of course they were not.	Fansels wiene se net.
There was no one home.	Der wie gjinien thús.
Really saw her.	Echt seach har.
She had been ill for a long time.	Se wie al lang siik.
Nothing seemed to matter much now.	Neat like no folle út te dwaan.
Soon it was day.	Al gau wie it dei.
It does not seem so long ago.	It liket net sa lang lyn.
He, knew who it was.	Hy, wist wa't it wie.
She can stay.	Se kin bliuwe.
It is not the same today.	It is hjoed net itselde.
I have no water with me.	Ik ha gjin wetter by my.
Look out too.	Sjoch der ek út.
But not only that.	Mar net allinnich dat.
Then again, he did not think so clearly.	Dan wer tocht er net sa dúdlik.
Or the boy.	Of de jonge.
It seemed a little too easy.	It like wat te maklik.
Of course now, his.	Fansels no, syn.
Who lets the dog out?	Wa lit de hûn út?
It will get much, much better.	It sil folle, folle better wurde.
I'm giving you money, here.	Ik jou jo jild, hjir.
You are free to go.	Jo binne frij om te gean.
Faith is bad.	Leauwe is min.
I did not know what she was talking about.	Ik wist net wêr't se it oer hie.
But it's not pretty.	Mar it is net moai.
Maybe it's true.	Miskien is it wier.
You are not going there.	Jo geane der net hinne.
If you are not happy, we are not happy.	As jo ​​​​net bliid binne, binne wy ​​​​net bliid.
I'm taking her home now.	Ik nim har no nei hûs.
He had a house there.	Hy hie dêr in hûs.
You hurt us when you do that.	Jo dogge ús sear as jo dat dogge.
Now that's not nice.	No is dat net moai.
Do not open the door for anyone.	Doch de doar foar gjinien iepen.
She saw the boy.	Se seach de jonge.
This was no longer my home.	Dit wie myn thús net mear.
Do not try to get in that door.	Besykje net yn dy doar te kommen.
They really do.	Se dogge it echt.
It was gone.	It wie fuort.
I can tell people to do things.	Ik kin minsken fertelle dingen te dwaan.
Ask the people.	Freegje de minsken.
It's better to be that way.	It is better om sa te wêzen.
And so he does.	En sa docht er.
I had to make good.	Ik moast goed meitsje.
Maybe it was just a long time ago.	Miskien wie it krekt lang lyn.
Not in the last place.	Net yn it lêste plak.
We need to find this person before anything happens.	Wy moatte dizze persoan fine foardat der wat bart.
I'm glad you're fine.	Ik bin bliid dat jo goed binne.
And he had it over.	En hy hie it oer.
I could never get through any of those things.	Ik koe noait troch ien fan dy dingen komme.
There's just no self to keep.	D'r is gewoan gjin sels om te hâlden.
And you could not either.	En dy koe ek net.
She wanted to be something else.	Se woe wat oars wêze.
Even to this day.	Ek oant hjoed de dei.
Can someone please help me to get this.	Kin immen my asjebleaft helpe om dit te krijen.
That seemed pretty easy at first.	Dat like earst frij maklik.
I never had.	Ik hie noait.
One to indicate everything.	Ien om alles oan te jaan.
That's for sure.	Dat is wis.
They were all that was bad.	Se wiene alles wat min wie.
And they make money.	En jild meitsje se.
It was for the best.	It wie foar it bêste.
And it works very well.	En it wurket hiel goed.
It will happen.	It sil barre.
I wanted to do something difficult.	Ik woe wat dreech dwaan.
What she took from him.	Wat se fan him naam.
I told you it would not be so.	Ik sei dy dat it net sa wurde soe.
I hope it was good for you too.	Ik hoopje dat it foar jo ek goed wie.
We did not do those things or think much of them.	Wy hawwe dy dingen net dien of der folle fan tinke.
Let me tell you, it's not good.	Lit my dy sizze, it is net goed.
You will like that too.	Dat sille jo ek leuk fine.
It hit home.	It rekke thús.
How he had found her.	Hoe't er har fûn hie.
He should know it.	Hy soe it witte moatte.
Maybe it hurts.	Miskien is it sear.
And everything works out the way it should.	En alles wurket út hoe't it moat.
Think of all the things you can do.	Tink oan alle dingen dy't jo kinne dwaan.
Have you had that.	Hawwe jo dat hân.
I want to know everything.	Ik wol alles witte.
But that's good.	Mar dat is goed.
Everything for his family.	Alles foar syn famylje.
We do not work, they work.	Wy wurkje net, se wurkje.
Someone woke up.	Immen waard wekker.
But she was only one woman.	Mar se wie mar ien frou.
It's hard for me to drive.	It is dreech foar my om te riden.
In truth, it was never that.	Yn wierheid, it wie nea dat.
I still know clearly of the morning.	Ik wit noch dúdlik fan 'e moarn.
He must be careful.	Hy moat foarsichtich wêze.
I'm sorry, boy.	It spyt my, jonge.
Your room is ready.	Jo keamer is klear.
I saw her when I came back to you.	Ik seach har doe't ik werom nei dy kaam.
It seemed long.	It like lang.
And even that may not be enough.	En sels dat kin net genôch wêze.
There had been something before.	Dêr hie earder wat west.
That's it.	Dat die se.
It looks good.	It sjocht der goed út.
I'm ready to give my life for you.	Ik bin ree om myn libben foar jo te jaan.
We ask for another help.	Wy freegje in oare help.
But she also never knew why.	Mar se wist ek noait wêrom.
Everyone looks at everyone.	Elkenien sjocht nei elkenien.
You knew it was her.	Jo wisten dat it har wie.
They stay home that evening.	Se bliuwe de jûn thús.
I will too.	Ik sil ek.
Be careful when driving.	Wês foarsichtich by it riden.
We need to take care of each other.	Wy moatte foar elkoar soargje.
Really the best friends.	Echt de bêste freonen.
We can see what happened.	Wy kinne sjen wat der bard is.
If not, then they should be.	As net, dan moatte se wêze.
I believe we are more good than bad.	Ik leau dat wy mear goed binne as min.
That's right, 'he said.	Krekt dat,' sei er.
We win nothing.	Wy winne neat.
Then they would get a new one.	Dan soene se in nije krije.
And it came pretty easy actually.	En it kaam frij maklik eins.
I really have.	Ik haw echt.
Maybe who she was.	Miskien wa't se wie.
I'm just not good at it.	Ik bin der mar net goed yn.
All you have to do is ask.	Alles wat jo hoege te dwaan is freegje.
I'm sure of course.	Ik bin der wis fan eins.
I would go and get it really.	Ik soe gean en krije it echt.
I walked to school.	Ik rûn nei skoalle.
It went bad.	It gie min.
We love her more than our parents.	Wy hâlde mear fan har as ús âlden.
I was so scared and did not know what to do.	Ik wie sa bang en wist net wat ik dwaan moast.
You do not have the money to do it.	Jo hawwe net it jild om it te dwaan.
It had been his house.	It hie syn hûs west.
There was no way he was here.	Der wie gjin manier dat hy hjir wie.
But he did not want to talk about it that day.	Mar hy woe der dy dei net oer prate.
I was not afraid.	Ik wie net bang.
You had to be tough.	Do moast hurd wêze.
He will live with me.	Hy sil by my wenje.
There you have it.	Dêr hast it.
They will be there in a year.	Se sille der oer in jier noch wêze.
You are my friend.	Do bist myn freon.
She was not a friend.	Se wie gjin freon.
For someone like him, making friends was not easy.	Foar ien as hy wie it net maklik om freonen te meitsjen.
It was no problem.	It wie gjin probleem.
No one should have done that.	Nimmen soe dat dien hawwe moatte.
I've done it, and it's not nice.	Ik haw dien it, en it is net moai.
So she said it.	Sa sei se it.
Just like you almost did not.	Krekt as hast it net dien.
She was very beautiful.	Se wie tige moai.
I did not know it would ask you there.	Ik wist net dat it jo dêr om freegje soe.
But it does not happen that often.	Mar it bart net sa faak.
Not very happy about this place.	Net hiel bliid oer dit plak.
He took it pretty well.	Hy naam it aardich goed.
There's no way he'd like her.	D'r is gjin manier dat hy har leuk fine soe.
He just kept going.	Hy gie gewoan troch.
But enough of that.	Mar dêr genôch fan.
Let me ask you.	Lit my dy freegje.
You have no chance of that.	Dêr ha jo gjin kâns op.
This is still true.	Dit is noch altyd wier.
We like to have things.	Wy wolle graach dingen hawwe.
That's not very nice of you, boy.	Dat is net hiel aardich fan dy, jonge.
I'm glad, for you, that she has one.	Ik bin bliid, foar dy, dat se ien hat.
You will be fine.	Jo wurde goed.
See, why not just do it.	Sjoch, wêrom dogge jo net gewoan.
Two children.	Twa bern.
That was not so easy these days.	Dat wie dizze dagen net sa maklik.
I have not seen him here before.	Ik haw him hjir noch net earder sjoen.
She does it herself.	Se docht it sels.
He did not know why.	Hy wist net wêrom.
At first it did not need anyone.	Earst hie it net ien nedich.
It is also not ready.	It is ek gjin ree.
I want you so much.	Ik wol dy sa folle.
Okay, let's go.	Goed, litte wy gean.
A life for a life.	In libben foar in libben.
And did they ever.	En diene se ea.
I live here now.	Ik wenje hjir no.
Just look what he would say.	Sjoch mar wat hy soe sizze.
She was like another person.	Se wie as in oare persoan.
We did it together and it was fun.	Wy diene it tegearre en it wie leuk.
He often got into trouble at school.	Hy hie faak yn problemen op skoalle.
I can not be it.	Ik kin it net wêze.
I saw around me what was going on.	Ik seach om my hinne wat der oan de hân wie.
He's a big boy now.	Hy is no in grutte jonge.
And now he's hurt again.	En no is er wer sear.
I hope they can.	Ik hoopje dat se kinne.
I really thought of nothing.	Ik tocht echt oan neat.
I was not there yet, and would not be for a long time.	Ik wie der noch net, en soe noch lang net wêze.
One away or two.	Ien fuort as twa.
I know nothing else to tell.	Ik wit neat oars te fertellen.
I could not believe he was gone.	Ik koe net leauwe dat er fuort wie.
You did not have it in you.	Do hiest it net yn dy.
I really needed money.	Ik hie echt jild nedich.
You have to give that to me too.	Dat moatte jo my ek jaan.
I can not say much about it yet.	Ik kin der hjir noch net folle oer sizze.
But mother did not ask.	Mar mem frege net.
A man does what is necessary.	In man docht wat nedich is.
This is your big chance.	Dit is dyn grutte kâns.
This is not how it works.	Dit is net hoe't it wurket.
It thinks like a man does.	It tinkt as in man docht.
She looked back at the door.	Se seach werom nei de doar.
You go, you.	Jo geane, jo.
It does everything we need to do.	It docht alles wat wy nedich hawwe om te dwaan.
It’s just, when you eat, just eat.	It is gewoan, as jo ite, ite gewoan.
It did not happen in a day and it was not easy.	It barde net yn in dei en it wie net maklik.
If you have things to do, then get it done.	As jo ​​dingen hawwe om te dwaan, meitsje it dan dien.
I still have some work to do.	Ik haw noch wat wurk te dwaan.
We'll eat dinner.	Wy sille ite ite.
His and yours.	Syn en dyn.
But it was hard to.	Mar it wie dreech om.
Nobody talked about it.	Nimmen hie it der oer.
That's nice.	Dat is moai.
But there is more, of course.	Mar der is mear, fansels.
He had met a girl.	Hy hie in famke moete.
Here it is, see.	Hjir is it, sjoch.
Her father was the only one who could.	Har heit wie de ienige dy't koe.
This is where the problem lies.	Dit is wêr't it probleem is.
Not sure how that would work.	Net wis hoe't dat soe wurkje.
It's just me and my family.	It binne gewoan ik en myn famylje.
Try it!.	Besykje it!.
One Last Thing.	Ien Lêste ding.
What seems to.	Wat liket te.
She's a woman again.	Se is wer in frou.
All in all, it's only a few hours of work.	Al mei al is it mar in pear oeren wurk.
I'll have to look into it.	Ik sil der nei sjen moatte.
But you are very good.	Mar do bist hiel goed.
Of course he had.	Fansels hie er.
But it's just not there anymore.	Mar it is der gewoan net mear.
It's the first thing you do.	It is it earste wat jo dogge.
That money was nothing.	Dat jild wie neat.
But she was not ready.	Mar se wie net klear.
Not so much.	Net safolle.
Everyone was still at home.	Elkenien wie noch thús.
I'll give that a try.	Ik sil dat in kâns jaan.
Woman said they would help.	Frou sei dat se helpe soene.
I could no longer.	Ik koe net mear.
One of a kind.	Ien fan in soarte.
Now we are friends.	No binne wy ​​freonen.
I'm just so mad at him.	Ik bin gewoan sa lilk op him.
She was the last of her kind.	Se wie de lêste fan har soarte.
Do not tell the police.	Fertel de plysje net.
If you need anything, just ask.	As jo ​​​​wat nedich binne, moatte jo mar freegje.
None of that really matters.	Gjin fan dat makket echt út.
Good with him, man.	Goed mei him, man.
I heard it, everyone heard it.	Ik hearde it, elkenien hearde it.
It's how we are made.	It is hoe't wy makke binne.
He started to get up.	Hy begûn op te kommen.
That's what they need.	Dat is wat se nedich hawwe.
Do this for a week.	Doch dit foar in wike.
Just like each other.	Krekt as elkoar.
Before you speak, think first.	Foardat jo prate, tink earst.
Pay attention to my words.	Let op myn wurden.
And they did just that.	En dat diene se krekt.
She liked him, he knew that.	Se mocht him graach, dat wist er.
I've seen them do it.	Ik haw se it dwaan sjoen.
Everyone started talking.	Elkenien begûn te praten.
I've not even been home yet.	Ik bin noch net iens thús west.
It will not be exactly the same.	It sil net krekt itselde wêze.
I tried to make a house for you if you need.	Ik besocht in hûs foar jo te meitsjen as jo nedich binne.
But it would not come.	Mar it soe net komme.
Neither does it.	Dat ek net.
I told you not to worry.	Ik sei dy net soargen.
In other words, it's not just one thing.	Mei oare wurden, it is net mar ien ding.
They were too scared to say anything.	Se wiene te bang om wat te sizzen.
Or maybe there's something else you want to try.	Of miskien is d'r wat oars dat jo wolle besykje.
All that was wrong was me.	Alles wat ferkeard wie, dat wie ik.
But that would be too easy.	Mar dat soe te maklik wêze.
You have a job to do.	Jo hawwe in baan te dwaan.
And my mother.	En myn mem.
I could not agree with him, had never seen him.	Ik koe him net iens, hie him nea sjoen.
Tell your friends.	Fertel dyn freonen.
We were all worried.	Wy wiene allegear soargen.
He had seen him when he got home.	Hy hie him sjoen doe't er thús kaam.
Love the following.	Hâld fan de folgjende.
Do not ask everyone to help you with your problem.	Freegje net elkenien om jo te helpen mei jo probleem.
We've been there.	Wy hawwe der west.
About three months.	Sa'n trije moanne.
I have not seen her for a few days.	Ik haw har in pear dagen net sjoen.
I think you should have known.	Ik tink dat jo it witte moatten hawwe.
Let's look at this.	Litte wy nei dit sjen.
It was his time.	It wie syn tiid.
What it's kind of.	Wat it soarte fan is.
He can not have both.	Hy kin net beide hawwe.
I do not need that now.	Dat haw ik no net nedich.
We've had this talk before.	Wy hawwe dit praat al earder hân.
He was through.	Hy wie troch.
You're long gone.	Do bist al lang fuort.
It just made you happy.	It makke jo gewoan bliid.
He is very angry.	Hy is tige lilk.
I can have it.	Ik kin it hawwe.
She needs her time to be a child.	Se hat har tiid nedich om in bern te wêzen.
It should still be here, do not worry.	It soe hjir noch moatte, meitsje jo gjin soargen.
He would not need them.	Hy soe se net nedich hawwe.
If you can think of it.	As jo ​​mar tinke kinne.
That makes you think.	Dat lit jo tinke.
You have given your all.	Jo hawwe jo jûn.
Life just went on.	It libben gie gewoan troch.
Anything can happen.	Der kin fan alles barre.
A beautiful child.	In moai bern.
It's the idea of ​​the idea.	It is it idee fan it idee.
But again, we have to be careful.	Mar wer, wy moatte foarsichtich wêze.
She walked through me.	Se rûn troch my hinne.
He arrived on time.	Hy kaam op tiid.
I'm sure.	Ik bin der wis fan.
I really wanted nothing.	Ik woe eins neat.
That seems like a good plan.	Dat liket in goed plan.
He could not be sure.	Hy koe der net wis fan wêze.
As long as we should be.	Sa lang as wy moatte wêze.
They have been here three years.	Se hawwe hjir trije jier west.
He would make it.	Hy soe it meitsje.
I could see the water.	Ik koe it wetter sjen.
That was by day.	Dat wie by dei.
She was everything to him.	Se wie alles foar him.
I have to tell you everything.	Ik moat dy alles fertelle.
We own it.	Wy hawwe it.
Has he tried and gotten.	Hat er besocht en krije.
It's probably the last time.	It is miskien de lêste kear.
Probably for money.	Wierskynlik foar jild.
You just would not want one anymore.	Jo soene gewoan gjin ien mear wolle.
If she wants to.	As se wol.
'fan'.	'fan'.
And so they were.	En sa wiene se.
It was really happening.	It wie echt bart.
I want her to be happy.	Ik wol dat se bliid is.
This is what we need to do.	Dit is wat wy moatte dwaan.
It's too easy.	It is te maklik.
There was good reason why this was so.	Der wie goede reden wêrom't dit sa wie.
It goes on.	It giet oan.
Have you ever been to this city?	Ha jo ea west yn dizze stêd?
He was at work.	Hy wie oan it wurk.
You know, my child is a good child.	Jo witte, myn bern is in goed bern.
Well, a man can be.	No, in man kin wêze.
But you are now mine.	Mar do bist no fan my.
You have to be careful what you want.	Jo moatte foarsichtich wêze wat jo wolle.
Maybe very bad.	Miskien wol hiel min.
I just had to be sure of that.	Ik moast der mar wis fan wêze.
But now it's back.	Mar no is it werom.
He wondered what the man thought.	Hy frege him ôf wat de man tocht.
I still did it.	Ik haw it noch dien.
She must have made them.	Se moat se makke hawwe.
I absolutely love it.	Ik hâld der hielendal fan.
Enough about me.	Genôch oer my.
Let me know if that's okay with you.	Lit my witte oft dat goed is mei dy.
What's more, they did not even know his name.	Wat mear is, se wisten net iens syn namme.
Tonight will help you.	Jûn sille jo helpe.
The guy is fine.	De keardel is goed.
I'll be back to the new one for too long.	Ik kom noch te lang werom op it nije.
She was pretty happy.	Se wie aardich bliid.
His other hand joined it.	Syn oare hân kaam der by.
People have not really seen.	Minsken hawwe net echt sjoen.
That's all, kids.	Dat is alles, bern.
It says nothing about those two.	It seit neat oer dy twa.
That's what I really decided.	Dat haw ik echt besletten.
Nobody seemed to care about that.	Nimmen like dêr te soargen oer.
Life goes where it goes.	It libben giet wêr't it giet.
It's not just an idea.	It is net gewoan in idee.
And around everyone.	En om elkenien hinne.
The first was so that you might think of your father.	De earste wie sa dat jo miskien tinke oan jo heit.
It can be done.	It kin dien wurde.
Can't help now.	Kin no net helpe.
It was the first time he did that.	It wie de earste kear dat er dat die.
The other has to do with a very young friend of mine.	De oare hat te krijen mei in hiel jonge freon fan my.
Not one of us.	Net ien fan ús.
But you have very little time to get a lot done.	Mar jo hawwe heul min tiid om in protte dien te krijen.
And there was no one, she had just been the first.	En der wie net ien, se hie gewoan de earste west.
And we make new friends who are different than we are.	En wy meitsje nije freonen dy't oars binne as wy binne.
Of course she does.	Fansels docht se dat.
You will know it soon.	Jo sille it gau witte.
Never too late.	Nea te let.
Maybe nothing more is needed.	Miskien is der neat mear nedich.
That too would be really difficult.	Ek dat soe echt dreech wurde.
He could see it.	Hy koe it sjen.
He said they would.	Hy sei dat se soene.
But there was no plan.	Mar der wie gjin plan.
I opened them, of course.	Ik makke se iepen, fansels.
I had no life for you.	Ik hie gjin libben foar dy.
He had him now.	Hy hie him no.
But he did.	Mar hy die.
Goes in a bowl.	Giet yn in kom.
My friend bought this for me.	Myn freon kocht dit foar my.
It just did not work for me.	It die it gewoan net foar my.
In a few days he's coming here.	Oer in pear dagen komt er hjir.
He did his job.	Hy die syn wurk.
I walked back through the room.	Ik rûn werom troch de keamer.
Everything was ready.	Alles wie klear.
The first is family.	De earste is famylje.
Went through everything with us, took a lot of time to look around us.	Rûn alles mei ús troch, naam in protte tiid om ús hinne te sjen.
We are entering a new era.	Wy geane in nije tiid yn.
And that would actually be quite good.	En dat soe eins hielendal goed wêze.
That makes people like it.	Dat makket dat minsken har leuk fine.
He the same.	Hy die itselde.
I'm trying to help you here.	Ik besykje jo hjir te helpen.
And now, let them try.	En no, lit se besykje.
It's so easy.	It is sa maklik.
I'm not looking at her.	Ik sjoch nimmen nei har.
There was a lot to do,	Der wie in protte te dwaan,
I wish we had seen more.	Ik winskje dat wy mear sjoen hiene.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
It can not be otherwise.	It kin net oars.
Everything was the same.	Alles wie itselde.
It's no time.	It is gjin tiid.
Many just liked him.	In protte like him krekt.
Here come problems.	Hjir komme problemen.
He was sure this problem would be gone.	Hy wie der wis fan dat dit probleem fuort soe wêze.
Were not much of a family.	Wiene net folle fan in famylje.
Not much more.	Net folle mear.
There was something about her.	Der wie wat oan har.
Last time for you.	Lêste kear foar dy.
For it all.	Foar it allegear.
It was too late now.	It wie no te let.
Can never tell.	Kin it noait fertelle.
The same people.	Deselde minsken.
But he has to wait.	Mar hy moat wachtsje.
Even if it was not so.	Ek al wie it net sa.
You have a wife and children.	Jo hawwe in frou en bern.
He has no job.	Hy hat gjin wurk.
Everyone who does bad things.	Elkenien die minne dingen.
You have to try it.	Jo moatte it besykje.
This was really good.	Dit wie echt goed.
You have just enough time.	Jo hawwe krekt genôch tiid.
I will not be those things.	Ik sil dy dingen net wêze.
But he thought she was wrong.	Mar hy tocht dat se ferkeard wie.
People do this.	Minsken dogge dit.
They live here.	Se wenje hjir.
It was not an animal.	It wie gjin bist.
I had not thought of that.	Dêr hie ik net oan tocht.
Those two.	Dy twa.
Well, of course not.	No, fansels net.
Now the house is no longer there.	No is it hûs der net mear.
The meeting is at three o'clock.	De gearkomste is om trije oere.
I hope to return, but when is the question.	Ik hoopje werom te kommen, mar wannear is de fraach.
Not sure where to go from there though.	Net wis wêr't te gean fan dêr wol.
Keep this in mind.	Hâld dit yn gedachten.
He would not tell me.	Hy soe it my net fertelle.
She had not been there.	Se hie der net west.
It goes on.	It giet oan.
Also something else.	Ek wat oars.
That's not a problem for you.	Dat is gjin probleem foar jo.
It was better.	It wie better.
She had to be alone.	Se moast allinnich wêze.
Come here first.	Kom hjir earst.
And we will win.	En wy sille winne.
We can not go back now.	Wy kinne no net werom.
It seems to me that they know we are here.	It liket my ta dat se witte dat wy hjir binne.
It will give nothing.	It sil neat jaan.
Tell them what they need to know, not what you know.	Fertel har wat se witte moatte, net wat jo witte.
It's in your family.	It is yn jo famylje.
I would have done otherwise.	Ik hie oars dien.
It was hard, hard, hard.	It wie dreech, hurd, hurd.
I was a little surprised.	Ik wie in bytsje ferrast.
We knew he was wrong.	Wy wisten dat hy ferkeard wie.
I love him, but I do not know what to do.	Ik hâld fan him, mar ik wit net wat te dwaan.
What does a man do for a living?	Wat docht de man foar in libben?
It must stop.	It moat ophâlde.
He had known the man for a long time.	Hy koe de man al lang.
But do not ask them for it.	Mar freegje har dêr net nei.
She was long gone.	Se wie al lang fuort.
I talk to him a lot.	Ik praat in protte mei him.
He did not seem to be.	Hy like it net te wêzen.
We have all been where you are now.	Wy hawwe allegear west wêr't jo no binne.
This all comes out wrong.	Dit komt allegear ferkeard út.
I want that now.	Dat wol ik no.
I just wanted to see something, everything happen.	Ik woe gewoan wat sjen, alles barre.
Well, almost never.	No, hast noait.
And there it just got away.	En dêr kaam it mar fuort.
You have given us this.	Jo hawwe ús dit jûn.
You're not the only one.	Do bist net de ienige.
You will be heard by me.	Jo sille troch my heard wurde.
I knew we had no chance.	Ik wist dat wy gjin kâns hiene.
Do you live in this city?	Wenje jo yn dizze stêd?
Go get them !.	Gean krije se!.
But it did no good.	Mar it die gjin goed.
He had no idea what to say.	Hy hie gjin idee wat er sizze soe.
When will you return to work?	Wannear sille jo werom nei it wurk?
She's fine.	It giet goed mei har.
It just kept going.	It bleau gewoan troch.
The young man talks to the girl.	De jonge man praat mei it famke.
And what else do they do.	En wat alles oars meitsje se.
He's not coming anymore.	Hy komt net mear.
I have not even heard of it.	Ik haw der noch net iens fan heard.
For him, and for me.	Foar him, en foar my.
And it can be just that.	En it kin krekt wêze.
It has you.	It hat dy.
Here try these.	Hjir besykje dizze.
I was a big fan.	Ik wie in grutte fan.
You should not.	Jo moatte net.
I do not feel good about it.	Ik fiel my dêr net goed by.
My bad then.	Myn min dan.
And the child.	En it bern.
And she does not want to be completely him.	En se wol net hielendal him wêze.
Tell her something.	Fertel har wat.
I hope he does.	Ik hoopje dat hy dat docht.
I could not stay.	Ik koe net bliuwe.
He does not eat.	Hy yt net.
I ran over.	Ik rûn oer.
But she could not think of that now.	Mar dêr koe se no net oan tinke.
That being said, this was not my favorite.	As it wurdt sein, dit wie net myn favorite.
Do not think, just do it !.	Net tinke, doch it gewoan!.
He told me that no one was interested.	Hy fertelde my dat gjinien ynteressearre wie.
Everyone had to leave.	Elkenien moast fuort.
You may not get another chance.	Jo krije miskien gjin oare kâns.
But for everyone.	Mar foar elkenien.
She agreed with me on everything.	Se wie it mei my iens oer alles.
They have great things.	Se hawwe grutte dingen.
You had the chance.	Jo hiene de kâns.
He knew he could not.	Hy wist dat er net mocht.
I could not see where you had done this.	Ik koe net sjen wêr't jo dit dien hiene.
I just do not believe it.	Ik leau it gewoan net.
We are ready for good.	Wy binne klear foar goed.
She has never done this before.	Se hat dit noch noait earder dien.
We both did.	Wy beide diene.
I just can not help it.	Ik kin it gewoan net helpe.
He said he had.	Hy sei dat hy hie.
These are people who need to know more than anyone.	Dit binne minsken dy't mear as elkenien witte moatte.
I was pretty over it.	Ik wie der aardich oer.
It would not hold him to me.	It soe him net oan my hâlde.
Well done wait.	Goed dien wachtsje.
It should work well now.	It moat no goed wurkje.
How could it happen? 	Hoe koe it barre?
Anyone can do that.	Elkenien kin dat dwaan.
Well, maybe not exactly this kind of thing.	No, miskien net krekt dit soarte ding.
But they could not do much about it.	Mar dêr koene se net folle oan dwaan.
This is my mother.	Dit is myn mem.
They do it and they do not think about it.	Se dogge it en se tinke der net oan.
See more here.	Sjoch hjir mear.
It has never done and never will.	It hat noait dien en sil noait.
He needed to know.	Hy moast it witte.
Never seen so much before.	Noch noait safolle sjoen.
But no one could.	Mar gjinien koe.
Who was he.	Wa wie hy.
I could give you work.	Ik koe jo wurk jaan.
We can talk then, 'he said.	Wy kinne dan prate,' sei er.
But they will come.	Mar se komme wol.
People just want to talk.	Minsken wolle gewoan prate.
I did not know where we were.	Ik wist net wêr't wy wiene.
It's only for one day.	It is mar foar in dei.
She took it as an opportunity.	Se naam it as in kâns.
I'm ready for the day.	Ik bin klear foar de dei.
This was always the thing that belonged to me.	Dit wie altyd it ding dat fan my wie.
Now it's too much.	No is it te folle.
I should know better.	Ik soe better witte moatte.
Maybe he heard her.	Miskien hearde er har.
He worries.	Hy makket him soargen.
Then it's long difficult.	Dan is it lang dreech.
There's nothing in it.	Der sit neat yn.
But there is still much to do.	Mar der is noch folle te dwaan.
Your hand, your big hand.	Dyn hân, dyn grutte hân.
I have enough for both.	Ik haw genôch foar beide.
She could not do that now.	Dat koe se no net.
You will never be completely with them.	Jo sille noait hielendal mei har wêze.
I was happy if it could.	Ik wie bliid as it kin.
Nothing in the car.	Neat yn 'e auto.
I could see what had been done and what had not been done.	Ik koe sjen wat der dien wie en wat net dien wie.
It's also pretty common.	It is ek frij gewoan.
As if nothing had happened at all.	As wie der hielendal neat bard.
But they have to do what they are told.	Mar se moatte dwaan wat har sein wurdt.
Otherwise it would not have been.	Oars hie it net west.
I do not want to.	Ek net wolle.
I do not want you to hurt my friends.	Ik wol net dat jo myn freonen sear meitsje.
But together we create opportunity.	Mar tegearre meitsje wy kâns.
I have done it twice in the past.	Ik haw it yn it ferline twa kear dien.
But she seems to be doing well.	Mar se liket it goed te dwaan.
It looks like he should have.	It liket derop dat hy moat hawwe.
Well, think about it this way.	No, tink der oer op dizze manier.
Of course not.	Fansels net.
Surprise is good.	Ferrast is goed.
She looks so different from how she even did a month ago.	Se sjocht der sa oars út as hoe't se sels in moanne lyn die.
It was never gone.	It wie nea fuort.
But something happened.	Mar der barde wat.
Things could have gone differently.	Dingen koene oars gean.
He needed to know.	Hy moast it witte.
I wanted to be with you, to see why.	Ik woe by dy wêze, om te sjen wêrom.
Know no more than that.	Net mear witte as dat.
Come with me this evening.	Kom mei my dizze jûn.
They want things.	Se wolle dingen.
It's clear.	It is dúdlik.
He says why.	Hy seit wêrom.
He must love her.	Hy moat fan har hâlde.
We do not know what he did or did not do.	Wy witte net wat er dien hat, of wat er net dien hat.
We got nothing.	Wy krigen neat.
Just one.	Krekt ien.
Maybe he will say her name.	Miskien sil er har namme sizze.
I would have loved to have seen them with you.	Ik hie se graach mei dy sjoen.
But they can do nothing '.	Mar se kinne neat dwaan'.
I can no longer look wrong or good.	Ik kin net mear ferkeard of goed sjen.
You're so tall!	Do bist sa lang!
People he might not have.	Minsken dy't er miskien net hawwe.
We are not quite there yet.	Wy binne der noch net hielendal.
A lot of people do that.	In protte minsken dogge dat.
One more time.	Noch ien kear.
There's just no question.	D'r is gewoan gjin fraach.
You scare everyone.	Jo meitsje elkenien bang.
We used to disagree.	Wy wiene it eartiids net iens.
You do not really know how much water you need.	Jo witte net echt hoefolle wetter jo nedich hawwe.
It was about her that it did.	It wie it oer har dat it die.
I'm sure you do.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo dogge.
And everyone, actually.	En elkenien, eins.
I'm nothing without a home.	Ik bin neat sûnder hûs.
This is how you want it, this is how you have it.	Dit hoe't jo it wolle, dit is hoe't jo it hawwe.
I need to talk to her.	Ik moat mei har prate.
Better believe it.	Better leauwe it.
You do not even know it.	Jo witte it net iens.
This is the dog.	Dit is de hûn.
She does not need to come up.	Se hat it net nedich om op te kommen.
I just wanted to be me.	Ik woe gewoan my wêze.
Do nothing.	Neat dwaan.
That's right.	Dat is wol sa.
It's just so wrong.	It is gewoan sa ferkeard.
He was going through a very bad time in his life.	Hy gie troch in heul minne tiid yn syn libben.
We've talked to you about it.	Wy hawwe it mei jo oer praat.
Life does not get better than this.	It libben wurdt net better as dit.
Think about it a lot.	Tink der in protte oer.
I'm scared.	Ik bin bang.
And that was just the beginning.	En dat wie krekt begûn.
So did many people.	Dat diene in protte minsken ek.
I knew too little.	Ik wist te min.
I have tried so many other things and nothing worked.	Ik haw safolle oare dingen besocht en neat wurke.
But it is different with them.	Mar it is mei har oars.
I think we need that.	Ik tink dat wy dat nedich hawwe.
She has decided she needs a new job.	Se hat besletten dat se in nije baan nedich hat.
But how do they do that.	Mar hoe dogge se dat.
I've never really met her.	Ik haw har eins noait moete.
I did not want to hurt anyone.	Ik woe net ien sear dwaan.
This thing will work, right?	Dit ding sil wurkje, krekt?
Must be so fun.	Moat sa leuk wêze.
He could do with her whatever he wanted.	Hy koe mei har dwaan wat er woe.
But now it's a real problem for you.	Mar no is it in echt probleem foar jo.
So did my father.	Dat die myn heit ek.
I did not want her to hear this.	Ik woe net dat se dit hearde.
I love that about her.	Ik hâld fan dat oer har.
This is shown in the following.	Dit is te sjen yn it folgjende.
Mom got sick.	Mem rekke siik.
Prison, we have to take care of them.	Finzenis, wy moatte foar har soargje.
Well, there it is.	No, dêr is it.
It must be.	It moat wêze.
Everything that happens, everyone knows it.	Alles wat bart, elkenien wit it.
I will not worry about it either.	Ik sil der ek gjin soargen oer meitsje.
', or go to'.	', of gean nei '.
They could not be sure what had happened.	Se koene net wis wêze wat der bard wie.
But something in me had to do it.	Mar wat yn my moast it dwaan.
But the children.	Mar de bern.
Who has this money?	Wa hat dit jild?
He lived his whole life in the city.	Hy wenne syn hiele libben yn 'e stêd.
It was just beautiful.	It wie gewoan moai.
I was worried about my friend.	Ik wie soargen oer myn freon.
Do not be such a child.	Wês net sa'n bern.
I was just looking at a picture.	Ik seach allinnich nei in foto.
We will always know almost nothing.	Wy sille altyd hast neat witte.
But one or two should do.	Mar ien of twa moatte dwaan.
He just wasn't there.	Hy wie der gewoan net.
Everyone let us know what you think.	Elkenien lit ús witte wat jo tinke.
We know how it works now.	Wy witte hoe't it no wurket.
Actually, probably for sure.	Eins, wierskynlik wis.
But I also do not do everything.	Mar ik doch ek net alles.
They could handle almost anything when they were together.	Se koene hast alles oan as se tegearre wiene.
I'm still not quite sure why that is.	Ik bin der noch net hielendal wis fan wêrom dat is.
He said he will know you.	Hy sei dat hy jo witte sil.
Then they stop.	Dan hâlde se op.
There is nothing you can do.	Der is neat kinne jo dwaan.
They know where their seat is.	Se witte wêr't har sit is.
And tell him why.	En fertel him wêrom.
Do something for me.	Doch wat foar my.
Of what? 	Fan wat?
said the first.	sei de earste.
The other man looked.	De oare man seach.
Maybe we should stop working.	Wy moatte miskien ophâlde mei it wurk.
People were angry.	Minsken wiene lilk.
I was just not sure.	Ik wie gewoan net wis.
He says nothing to me.	Hy seit neat tsjin my.
Be true to who you are.	Wês wier oan wa't jo binne.
She was surprised when she found him at the lake.	Se wie ferrast doe't se him by de mar fûn.
I wish it did.	Ik woe dat it die.
I do not know why this happened.	Ik wit net wêrom dit barde.
She has worked hard.	Se hat hurd wurke.
One more thing.	Noch ien ding.
This has me and mine.	Dit hat my en myn.
And we never ask for anything other than money back.	En wy freegje noait oars as jild werom.
I think it was much needed.	Ik tink dat it folle nedich wie.
He can play anything.	Hy kin alles spylje.
That did not matter too much.	Dat makke net al te folle út.
But they were good at what they did.	Mar se wiene goed yn wat se diene.
He looked at the moon.	Hy seach nei de moanne.
But you scare me.	Mar jo meitsje my bang.
Then the word comes around.	Dan komt it wurd om.
I'll tell you this morning.	Ik sil it dy moarn fertelle.
Stop, he said.	Hâld op, sei er.
But she does not have to.	Mar se hoecht net.
He was too late, but he should be there now.	Hy wie te let, mar hy soe der no wêze moatte.
You may also believe the same thing.	Jo kinne ek leauwe itselde ding.
Clearly it does.	Dúdlik docht it.
By that time, it's too late.	Tsjin dy tiid is it te let.
She asked me and for me that is enough.	Se hat my frege en foar my is dat genôch.
I'm going back to doing nothing.	Ik gean werom nei neat dwaan.
You had no idea how long you would wait.	Jo hiene gjin idee hoe lang jo wachtsje soene.
Wherever you are.	Wêr't jo ek binne.
And no one likes the other.	En net ien liket de oare.
And it's still true.	En it is noch altyd wier.
He has no idea what to do.	Hy hat gjin idee wat er dwaan moat.
Well, we had no plan.	No, wy hiene gjin plan.
They should have known.	Se hiene it witte moatten.
You would not be happy to just be a wife and mother.	Jo soene net bliid wêze om gewoan in frou en mem te wêzen.
This is not your child.	Dit is net dyn bern.
That's the.	Dat is de.
It will never be enough.	It sil nea genôch wêze.
For once, it can not be about the money.	Foar ien kear kin it net om it jild gean.
Take good care of the children.	Sjoch goed nei de bern.
With you in.	Mei dy yn.
She looked at me.	Se seach my oan.
I was not for this.	Ik wie hjir net foar.
When of course he knew nothing.	Doe't er fansels neat wist.
He told me one last time that he loved me.	Hy fertelde my in lêste kear dat er fan my hâlde.
Is not entirely clear.	Is net hielendal dúdlik.
Only they can do it.	Allinnich se kinne it dwaan.
That was what they had said at home.	Dat hiene se thús sein.
He arrived late for work.	Hy kaam te let foar it wurk.
Has interested me a lot.	Hat my in protte ynteressearre.
But pay attention to what happens then.	Mar let op wat der dan bart.
It's her name.	It is har namme.
Or it will find them.	Of it sil se fine.
I feel worried.	Ik fiel my soargen.
A few did.	In pear diene.
But it does not work.	Mar it wurket net.
Then we know what you really need.	Dan witte wy wat jo echt nedich binne.
Then they go out the door.	Dan geane se de doar út.
I'm always with you.	Ik bin altyd by dy.
Actually nothing.	Eins neat.
But that's all for the good.	Mar dat is alles ta it goede.
That's bad to say.	Dat is min te sizzen.
Nobody can.	Nimmen kin.
We love both of our children.	Wy hâlde fan ús beide bern.
She does.	Dat docht se.
But nothing else.	Mar oars neat.
He would not put another woman through it.	Hy soe dêr gjin oare frou troch sette.
She was very tall.	Se wie tige lang.
You have no one here with you.	Jo hawwe hjir gjinien mei dy.
But that, of course, is not true.	Mar dat is fansels net wier.
Well, let me tell you this.	No, lit my jo dit fertelle.
Just, would not.	Gewoan, soe net.
She was beautiful.	Moai wie se.
But it was not her place to say that.	Mar it wie net har plak om dat te sizzen.
They tell us almost nothing.	Se fertelle ús hast neat.
Three hours ago.	Trije oeren lyn.
But not for long.	Mar net lang.
Probably something not so good.	Wierskynlik wat net sa goed.
Not sure what this is about.	Net wis wêr't dit oer giet.
People get tired of me.	Minsken wurde wurch fan my.
She was very happy with it.	Se wie der tige bliid mei.
I'll tell you how.	Ik fertel dy hoe.
Then she comes out.	Dan komt se út.
I know for a fact that they may have been.	Ik wit bliid dat se miskien west hawwe.
They will help you, he said.	Se sille dy helpe, sei er.
We do not like that idea.	Wy fine dat idee net leuk.
I'm looking at you, he said.	Ik sjoch nei dy, sei er.
If he would.	As hy soe.
I think you should know that.	Ik tink dat jo dat witte soene.
It worked, for a few days.	It wurke, foar in pear dagen.
This is how it should be.	Dit is hoe't it moat.
Not in life.	Net yn it libben.
How they love him.	Hoe't se fan him hâlde.
These are my last words.	Dit binne myn lêste wurden.
It was just good.	It wie mar goed.
Anyone can say that.	Elkenien kin dat sizze.
It's not good, but it was the truth.	It is net goed, mar it wie de wierheid.
That's what she does with everyone.	Dat liket se mei elkenien.
This can not go on forever.	Dit kin net foar altyd gean.
A real book.	In echt boek.
He seemed nice enough.	Hy like aardich genôch.
In this place we can also find our place.	Op dit plak kinne wy ​​ek ús plak fine.
This year, next year, or who knows what year.	Dit jier, takom jier, of wa wit hokker jier.
It's the only way.	It is de ienige manier.
Well done and keep up the good work.	Goed dien en gean troch mei it goede wurk.
None of us said a word.	Gjin fan ús sei in wurd.
He was as hard as they come.	Hy wie sa hurd as se komme.
I said yes.	Ik sei wol.
Here she had everything she needed.	Hjir hie se alles wat se nedich hie.
I did not expect you to know this.	Ik hie net ferwachte dat jo dit wisten.
I have not spoken to her since.	Ik haw sûnt dy tiid net mei har praat.
But it worked.	Mar it wurke.
It does what it wants to do.	It docht wat it dwaan wol.
I believe in the man you are.	Ik leau yn de man dy't jo binne.
He did not know what to do with it.	Hy wist net wat er der mei oan moast.
It worked really well.	It wurke echt goed.
That time was fun.	Dy tiid wie leuk.
He will not, he can not.	Hy sil net, hy kin net.
That may be why nothing happened.	Dat kin wêze wêrom't neat bard.
The city was frequently visited.	De stêd waard faak besocht.
I was talking about the other.	Ik hie it oer de oare.
You should have been there.	Do hiest der wêze moatten.
I did more than anyone else would.	Ik die mear as immen oars soe.
He was surprised that he was surprised.	Hy wie ferrast dat er ferrast wie.
A lot of people did.	In protte minsken diene.
He's not very nice.	Hy is net hiel aardich.
I came off easily.	Ik kaam maklik ôf.
This has never happened before.	Dit is noch noait earder bard.
Maybe even a place.	Miskien sels in plak.
Do not even come to me.	Kom net iens by my.
Name is just one word.	Namme is mar ien wurd.
You go through if you can.	Jo geane troch as jo kinne.
He opened his door.	Hy die syn doar iepen.
I can get them for you.	Ik kin se foar jo krije.
But she's awake.	Mar se is wekker.
For three months now.	Foar trije moanne no.
To say.	Sizze.
And so he died.	En sa stoar er.
He had to say it.	Hy moast it sizze.
They must be.	Se moatte wêze.
But she could do it.	Mar se koe dit dwaan.
They were talking.	Se wiene oan it praten.
One thing is, or it is not.	Ien ding is, of it is net.
See the herring coming.	Se sille komme.
There is really nothing for me to do.	Der is echt neat foar my te dwaan.
She could not see me.	Se koe my net sjen.
I wanted to be better than that.	Ik woe better wêze as dat.
I have been, but you can find them.	Ik haw west, mar jo kinne se fine.
You probably do too.	Jo wierskynlik ek.
But we stay here.	Mar wy bliuwe hjir.
Everything should work now.	Alles moat no wurkje.
They become family.	Se wurde famylje.
The other arrives there as well.	De oare komt dêr ek oan.
A man who is not a father is not a man.	In man dy't gjin heit is, is gjin man.
I just wanted to pay and get out of there.	Ik woe gewoan betelje en der wei.
They would be.	Se soene wêze.
He had been in her room.	Hy hie yn har keamer west.
Her money is good.	Har jild is goed.
I just do not know what else to say.	Ik wit gewoan net wat ik dêr oars op sizze moat.
He had to do what he had to do.	Hy moast dwaan wat er dwaan moast.
And now they would never be.	En no soene se noait wêze.
They know what happened.	Se witte wat der bard is.
He was always good to me.	Hy wie altyd goed foar my.
He's home now, in bed.	Hy is no wol thús, op bêd.
But it was real.	Mar it wie echt.
It's so beautiful.	It is sa moai.
Well, maybe we do and maybe not.	No, miskien dogge wy en miskien net.
What would happen to my hair.	Wat soe der mei myn hier barre.
It was her only plan.	It wie har ienige plan.
Maybe something of both.	Miskien wat fan beide.
They become friends for life.	Se wurde freonen foar it libben.
There is no just.	Der is gjin gewoan.
Then she just wants to stay home.	Dan wol se mar thús bliuwe.
Do not give it up !, she said.	Jou dit net ôf!, sei se.
I can not do it now.	Ik kin it no net dwaan.
I've got.	Ik haw.
We no longer have to go to school.	Wy hoege net mear nei skoalle te gean.
That came and went.	Dat kaam en gie.
I could see what was expected of me.	Ik koe sjen wat der fan my ferwachte waard.
It's a thing.	It is in ding.
But only almost.	Mar allinnich hast.
He does what he wants now.	Hy docht wat er no wol.
Where are we going.	Wêr geane wy ​​hinne.
This is what you have to believe.	Dit moatte jo leauwe.
You just ask for trouble when you do !.	Jo freegje gewoan om problemen as jo dogge!.
We need to keep talking about it.	Wy moatte der oer prate bliuwe.
We had a few issues.	Wy hiene in pear problemen.
Maybe she really did.	Miskien hat se it echt dien.
He wanted to know more.	Hy woe mear witte.
Maybe that's okay.	Miskien is dat wol goed.
He needed me to be there for him.	Hy hie my nedich om der foar him te wêzen.
But not so with you.	Mar net sa mei dy.
That must be it.	Dat moat it wêze.
Such a problem has happened before.	Sa'n probleem is earder bard.
It does not look good.	It sjocht der net goed út.
It's a great movie.	It is in grutte film.
Nobody needs it anymore.	Nimmen hat it mear nedich.
I do not want him to know this.	Ik wol net dat er dit wit.
She wanted to leave.	Se woe fuort.
It did her no good.	It die har gjin goed.
I knew he was a badass.	Ik wist dat hy in min wie.
He does not even like me.	Hy hâldt net iens fan my.
It's really very good.	It is echt hiel goed.
No chance was given to do so.	Gjin kâns om dat te dwaan waard jûn.
It made me feel completely different.	It fielde my hielendal oars.
Please try this before you buy.	Besykje dit asjebleaft foardat jo keapje.
She wanted to believe.	Se woe leauwe.
Or for him.	Of foar him.
No one knew what she was doing there alone.	Nimmen wist wat se dêr allinnich die.
It does not work for one reason or another.	It wurket net om ien of oare reden.
They would really let us down.	Se soene ús echt litte litte.
Nice work on this !.	Moai wurk oan dizze!.
Again, you can not say how long they will be.	Jo kinne wer net sizze hoe lang se sille wêze.
She did not like him.	Se mocht him net.
He indicated that he would do so.	Hy joech oan dat er dat dwaan soe.
I have so many questions.	Ik haw safolle fragen.
That did not matter now.	Dat hoegde no net.
This year is the first year.	Dit jier is it earste jier.
That door is open.	Dy doar stiet iepen.
He told her she was wrong.	Hy fertelde har dat se ferkeard wie.
Life happens.	It libben bart.
I've been home all week.	Ik bin de hiele wike thús west.
Everything and everyone.	Alles en elkenien.
I try to keep away from other people.	Ik besykje te hâlden fuort fan oare minsken.
These people, they are family.	Dizze minsken, se binne famylje.
A man has to go to things.	In man moat oan de dingen gean.
It just does not work.	It wurket gewoan net.
It was just a girl with him.	It wie mar in famke by him.
I totally agree.	Ik bin it hielendal iens.
Everything was fine.	Alles wie goed.
And it works.	En it wurket.
He could do nothing.	Hy koe neat dwaan.
But that was never the idea.	Mar dat wie nea it idee.
But he knew he had to do something.	Mar hy wist dat er wat dwaan moast.
I really did not think much.	Ik tocht echt net folle.
Go with it.	Gean der mei.
Water was his life.	Wetter wie syn libben.
Get out before he gets home.	Gean út foardat hy thús komt.
He told her he might be mistaken.	Hy fertelde har dat er miskien wêze soe.
How does this work?	Hoe wurket dit?
It’s about what you don’t like.	It giet oer wat jo net leuk fine.
I'm sorry, man.	It spyt my, man.
In what is heard, let it be heard.	Yn wat heard wurdt, lit dêr mar it hearde wêze.
her mother had asked me.	har mem hie my frege.
I feel good too.	Ik fiel my ek goed.
No one could make me do them.	Nimmen koe meitsje my dwaan se.
It's for him.	It is foar him.
The guy looked up.	De keardel seach op.
I do not let them.	Ik lit se net litte.
An idea! 	In idee!
he says.	hy seit.
Or he may not have more than.	Of hy hat miskien net mear as.
He looked around.	Hy seach om him hinne.
Do not do it if you do not like it.	Doch it net as jo it net leuk fine.
They think you'll never know.	Se tinke dat jo it noait sille witte.
He was out of his place.	Hy wie út syn plak.
With no one to see.	Mei gjinien te sjen.
It's after one.	It is nei ien.
He seemed to be talking to himself.	Hy like tsjin himsels te praten.
They have no idea how this can happen.	Se hawwe gjin idee hoe't dit kin barre.
It's not fun, and it's hard.	It is net leuk, en it is dreech.
Everyone knew who he was.	Allegear wisten wa't hy wie.
There are no children.	Der is gjin bern.
They did everything for them.	Se diene alles foar har.
He seemed free.	Hy like frij.
That will not work this time.	Dat sil dizze kear net wurkje.
I do not go as last.	Ik gean net as lêste.
She could handle that.	Dat koe se oan.
And it can be wrong.	En it kin ferkeard wêze.
But she could not be sure.	Mar se koe der net wis fan wêze.
And they could never get out.	En se koene noait út.
It can be just about anything.	It kin gewoan oer alles wêze.
Tell me about your family.	Fertel my oer dyn famylje.
She is such an open person.	Se is sa'n iepen persoan.
Hold your	Hâld dyn
Everyone has to do that.	Elkenien moat dat dwaan.
Do not talk to me.	Praat net tsjin my.
Of course it did.	Fansels die it.
That was not entirely good.	Dat wie net hielendal goed.
He was happy when he got a new job.	Hy wie bliid doe't er in nije baan krige.
It is not for children.	It is net foar bern.
I do not know them all.	Ik ken se net allegear.
It's hard to get open.	It is dreech om iepen te kommen.
Not on its own.	Net op himsels.
Probably both interested.	Wierskynlik beide ynteressearre.
She had always enjoyed reading.	Se hie altyd graach lêzen.
If you do, ask for it.	As jo ​​​​dat dogge, freegje it dan oan.
Same but different.	Itselde mar oars.
I have no idea what they're thinking.	Ik haw gjin idee wat se tinke.
She heard the whole thing.	Se hearde it hiele ding.
He is a different kind.	Hy is in oare soarte.
But let me out of there.	Mar lit my der út.
They are beautiful, but not necessary.	Se binne moai, mar net nedich.
But there you are.	Mar dêr binne jo.
I know he knows it.	Ik wit dat hy it wit.
We'll talk to you about it.	Wy sille der mei prate.
I can work all day.	Ik kin de hiele dei wurkje.
You made it work.	Jo hawwe it wurk makke.
Do not talk while eating.	Praat net as jo ite.
We are in this together.	Wy binne yn dit tegearre.
I love people.	Ik hâld fan minsken.
You do not want to be like him.	Jo wolle net wêze as hy.
Let me know if you have any questions.	Lit my witte as jo fragen hawwe.
He goes to his office every day.	Hy giet alle dagen nei syn kantoar.
Now, let's see if you can do this.	No, lit ús sjen oft jo dit kinne dwaan.
We knew it was our last time together.	Wy wisten dat it ús lêste tiid tegearre wie.
We seem to be doing well so far.	Wy lykje it oant no ta goed te dwaan.
For my father for me, and me now.	Foar myn heit foar my, en my no.
But this is not so.	Mar dit is net sa.
But even without that.	Mar ek sûnder dat.
That's always the way it is.	Dat is altyd de manier fan it.
That can be.	Dat kin wêze.
But that was not enough.	Mar dat wie net genôch.
And he will do it.	En hy sil it dwaan.
She never told me about this.	Se fertelde my noait oer dit.
We are afraid of them.	Wy binne bang foar har.
I'm three years old.	Ik bin trije jier âld.
My other friends help me.	Myn oare freonen helpe my.
There was something wrong.	Der siet wat oan.
I can do this without my dad.	Ik kin dit dwaan sûnder myn heit.
You are the people.	Jo binne de minsken.
Then another, and another.	Dan noch ien, en noch ien.
But now they are long gone.	Mar no binne se al lang fuort.
A few people had.	In pear minsken hiene.
Not my favorite.	Net myn favorite.
And that was just last week.	En dat wie krekt ferline wike.
That's it, you did.	Dat is it, jo dien.
That's what they want us to do.	Dat wolle se dat wy dogge.
And you know why.	En jo witte wêrom.
I asked him if he was ever scared.	Ik frege him oft er oait bang wie.
It happens now.	It bart no.
We have not had enough of it yet.	Wy hawwe der noch net genôch fan.
We have to be.	Wy moatte wêze.
She did not want him to see her like that.	Se woe net dat hy har sa seach.
They will need you.	Se sille jo nedich hawwe.
Let her worry about what he can do next.	Lit har har soargen meitsje oer wat er dan kin dwaan.
He's after something to eat.	Hy is nei wat te iten.
He said he was.	Hy sei dat hy wie.
I needed some help.	Ik hie wat help nedich.
I arrived.	Ik kaam oan.
You do not have to do it by hand.	Jo hoege it net mei de hân te dwaan.
She gave up on you.	Se joech dy op.
They are better than that.	Se binne better as dat.
The book had not been there before.	It boek hie der noch net earder west.
I did not ask it or so.	Ik frege it net of sa.
But of course.	Mar fansels.
It does not matter.	It makket neat út.
You only have one life.	Jo hawwe mar ien libben.
This was too little.	Dit wie te min.
I could be.	Ik koe wêze.
Clearly, that did not happen here.	Dúdlik is dat hjir net bard.
Siik.	Siik.
Clearly this was not what she had expected of him.	Dúdlik wie dat net wat se fan him ferwachte hie.
I want nothing more to do with him.	Ik wol neat mear mei him te krijen hawwe.
I told him that yesterday.	Dat sei ik him juster.
Nothing to eat.	Neat iten.
It was just like, well, this is kind of work for me.	It wie krekt as, goed, dit is in soarte fan wurk foar my.
It is not often that we get the chance.	It is net faak dat wy de kâns krije.
Anyway, it's not really my money.	Hoe dan ek, it is net echt myn jild.
That must be wrong.	Dat moat ferkeard wêze.
This must be the place!	Dit moat it plak wêze!
I'm already doing it.	Ik doch it al.
I took it.	Ik naam it.
He says it is.	Hy seit dat it is.
We will not be long.	Wy sille net lang wêze.
I don 't even think about it anymore.	Ik tink der net iens mear oer nei.
It may work again.	It kin wer wurkje.
Let it go then.	Lit it dan litte.
It even has a door.	It hat sels in doar.
This is difficult.	Dit is dreech.
You can not love this from your parents.	Jo kinne dit net fan jo âlden hâlde.
He was so angry.	Hy wie sa lilk.
This time he said that.	Dizze kear sei er dat.
That's what they do.	Dat dogge se wol.
I believe he can do that.	Ik leau dat er dat kin.
It was unlikely he would ever see her again.	It wie net wierskynlik dat er har oait wer sjen soe.
Not very likely.	Net heul wierskynlik.
I know he's getting better.	Ik wit dat er better wurdt.
This was my friend.	Dit wie myn freon.
Exactly the same.	Krekt itselde.
But please, please come back tomorrow.	Mar asjebleaft, kom asjebleaft moarn werom.
I could not wait to get there.	Ik koe net wachtsje om dêr te kommen.
Let me know how it goes !.	Lit my witte hoe't it giet!.
I want this.	Ik wol dit.
He's someone you can not help but like.	Hy is ien dy't jo net oars kinne as leuk fine.
Here they are.	Hjir binne se.
More than enough.	Mear as genôch.
If you do not ask, you will get angry.	As jo ​​​​net freegje, wurde jo lilk.
Let me tell you a little bit about both.	Lit my jo in bytsje fertelle oer beide.
He has a friend who wants it.	Hy hat in freon dy't it wol.
And that's probably the problem.	En dat is wierskynlik it probleem.
She is so beautiful.	Se is sa moai.
I'll give you everything.	Ik sil dy alles jaan.
When we happen to see it.	As wy it barre te sjen.
I wanted to ask you that.	Dêr woe ik dy nei freegje.
I have no idea how to do this.	Ik haw gjin idee hoe't ik dit dwaan moat.
I do not want that either.	Dat wol ik ek net.
She did not finish it.	Se die it net ôf.
She better not tell her mother.	Se kin it har mem better net fertelle.
Not in a week.	Net yn in wike.
You had me.	Do hiest my.
If only the word were so.	As it wurd mar sa wie.
It does the same thing.	It docht itselde ding.
That did not happen this time.	Dat barde dizze kear net.
There were good days and bad days.	Der wiene goede dagen en minne dagen.
He looked at the girl.	Hy seach nei it famke.
That one last night just did not like.	Dat ien fannacht gewoan net leuk.
I did exactly what you said.	Ik haw krekt dien wat jo sein hawwe.
The couple had no children.	It pear hie gjin bern.
Serve, he said.	Dien, sei er.
He needs to eat something.	Hy moat wat ite.
I could not do what they do.	Ik koe net dwaan wat se dogge.
Do not be afraid.	Wês net bang.
If you like someone, tell them.	As jo ​​​​ien leuk fine, fertel har dan.
I just want to be the best.	Ik wol gewoan de bêste wêze.
To be or not to be, that is the question.	Wês of net wêze, dat is de fraach.
There was so much to do to get ready.	Der wie safolle te dwaan om klear te meitsjen.
I think you are.	Ik tink do bist.
It does not look good.	It sjocht der net goed út.
Be the best you can be.	Wês de bêste dy't jo kinne wêze.
We can better hope she did not think it was us.	Wy kinne better hoopje dat se net tinkt dat it ús wiene.
Can also take the car.	Kin ek de auto nimme.
That's so beautiful.	Dat is sa moai.
I had not thought of that.	Dêr hie ik net oan tocht.
You do not seem to have.	Jo lykje net te hawwen.
They do not like that.	Dat hâlde se net.
I'll be back in a few hours.	Ik kom oer in pear oeren werom.
People could not stand it.	Minsken koene it net oan.
He had to come to that meeting.	Hy moast by dy gearkomste komme.
I think it got to her.	Ik tink dat it har krige.
It was my father.	It wie myn heit.
It was a place to see.	It wie in plak om te sjen.
He was mad at me for doing that.	Hy wie lilk op my dat ik dat die.
One day a man visited the city.	Op in dei besocht in man de stêd.
Or even both.	Of sels beide.
Come in today.	Kom hjoed yn.
They were from his mother.	Se wiene fan syn mem.
She did not want to.	Se woe net.
We can not agree or disagree.	Wy kinne it net iens noch net iens wêze.
His work is his life.	Syn wurk is syn libben.
I have to go, and so do you.	Ik moat gean, en do ek.
I have been working on them.	Ik haw oan har wurke.
I can take anything for three months.	Ik kin trije moanne alles nimme.
We have to be careful when driving.	Wy moatte foarsichtich wêze by it riden.
But of course the water comes along.	Mar fansels komt it wetter by.
Not much, but a little.	Net folle, mar in bytsje.
Maybe she will love him.	Miskien sil se fan him hâlde.
Just like a year earlier not.	Krekt as in jier earder net.
He knew what was under him now.	Hy wist wat der no ûnder him wie.
But of course they know you're driving my car.	Mar se witte fansels dat jo myn auto riden.
There it was not.	Do wie it net.
Come here now.	Kom no hjir.
That he knew me better than anyone.	Dat er my better koe as immen.
But if that man of yours is not good for you.	Mar as dy man fan dy net goed is foar dy.
And your husband.	En dyn man.
For them, you have to help.	Foar har moatte jo helpe.
Not so much for me.	Net sa folle foar my.
You could see what it did to him.	Jo koene sjen wat it mei him die.
I can not look at him.	Ik kin net nei him sjen.
No one can be so happy.	Nimmen kin sa bliid wêze.
That in itself was fun though.	Dat wie op himsels wol leuk.
I just came to see.	Ik kaam krekt sjen.
What other people had once said about him.	Wat oare minsken seine hie er eartiids oer.
Really, she could not believe she had not seen this before.	Echt, se koe net leauwe dat se dit net earder sjoen hie.
Do not tell me.	Fertel it my net.
I would have said the same thing.	Ik soe hawwe sein itselde ding.
It's her car.	It is har auto.
Do this.	Docht dit.
Like today.	Sa as hjoed.
We love him though.	Wy hâlde fan him wol.
They put their hair back.	Se sette har hier werom.
You are not coming with us.	Jo komme net mei ús.
But there are problems.	Mar der binne problemen.
They never have and they never will.	Se hawwe nea en se sille nea.
He must have been from another city.	Hy moat út in oare stêd west hawwe.
It was also true.	It wie ek wier.
They are going wrong.	Se geane ferkeard oan.
I was completely alone.	Ik wie hielendal allinnich.
So tired, he thought.	Sa wurch, tocht er.
I have all the problems.	Ik haw alle problemen.
I am nobody and everyone.	Ik bin nimmen en elkenien.
She had no idea what they were doing or who they were.	Se hie gjin idee wat se diene of wa't se wiene.
It's not the same thing.	It is net itselde ding.
What do you say ?.	Wat sizze jo?.
I see you.	Ik sjoch dy.
I felt it.	Ik fielde it.
He was going to play a guy, and the guy did not show up.	Hy soe in keardel spylje, en de keardel liet net sjen.
He says he will find the money.	Hy seit dat er it jild fine sil.
If you can think of it, they can make it.	As jo ​​​​it tinke kinne, kinne se it meitsje.
And he did not ask her to come to him.	En hy frege har net om by him te kommen.
But they do not want you to know their plan.	Mar se wolle net dat jo har plan witte.
Not now, too early.	No net, te betiid.
Nobody really knew what was going on.	Nimmen wist echt wat der oan de hân wie.
They now have one person.	Se hawwe no ien persoan.
Let's put a dog in it.	Litte wy der in hûn yn sette.
I thought you would be happy to see me.	Ik tocht dat jo bliid wêze soene om my te sjen.
In fact, they were here.	Eins wiene se hjir.
And you say, many of these people are good people.	En jo sizze, in protte fan dizze minsken binne goede minsken.
She did not need it.	Se hie it net nedich.
And even my mom likes you.	En sels myn mem liket dy leuk.
I would never do that.	Dat soe ik noait dwaan.
She said something.	Se sei wat.
But I can not find it.	Mar ik kin it net fine.
It was the best day of his life.	It wie de bêste dei fan syn libben.
I almost ran out.	Ik rûn hast út.
She made up her mind about something.	Se makke har gedachten oer wat.
When he got in the way.	As hy yn 'e wei kaam.
Knew what they were talking about.	Wist wêr't se it oer hiene.
This is also not done in a day.	Dit wurdt ek net yn in dei dien.
They are done for.	Se binne dien foar.
They can be happy.	Se kinne bliid wêze.
It was the first time she had been there.	It wie de earste kear dat se dêr west hie.
I heard it.	Ik hearde it.
I have nothing to do.	Ik haw gjin dingen te dwaan.
You can be the best you can be.	Jo kinne it bêste wêze dat jo kinne wêze.
Until then, he would take it one day at a time.	Oant dan, hy soe nimme it ien dei op in tiid.
I'm so scared of her.	Ik bin sa bang foar har.
I had not done it yet.	Ik wie it noch net dien.
This is not about you.	Dit giet net oer dy.
They did not hurt much.	Se rekke net folle sear.
He will talk, or not talk, with his wife about the food.	Hy sil prate, of net prate, mei syn frou oer it iten.
I have this.	Ik haw dit.
I open it first.	Ik doch it earst iepen.
Here goes.	Hjir giet.
And we.	En wy.
Keep it alive.	It libben hâlde.
You or he may have a job.	Jo of hy kin in baan hawwe.
Here's how it works.	Hjir is hoe't it wurket.
Her mother did not want me to do it.	Har mem woe net dat ik it die.
This is what she's like.	Dit is wat se liket.
It would not stop.	It soe net ophâlde.
She looked scared to be there.	Se seach der bang út om dêr te wêzen.
She took you back.	Se naam dy werom.
I did not shake his hand.	Ik joech him de hân net.
They did not know he was there.	Se wisten net dat er der wie.
I do not come to your house and do it for you.	Ik kom net nei jo hûs en doch it foar jo.
Then he does it again.	Dan docht er it wer út.
I ask nothing more.	Ik freegje neat mear.
Please do not try to access it.	Besykje asjebleaft der net ta op te kommen.
Just take her name.	Nim allinnich har namme.
Please.	Asjebleaft.
All everyone has to do is try.	Alles wat elkenien moat dwaan is besykje.
It would seem.	It soe lykje.
I did not want to go back to my room.	Ik woe net werom nei myn keamer.
A not very tall someone.	In net hiel lang immen.
No one was away.	Gjinien wie fuort.
If you want to work, you work.	As jo ​​wurkje wolle, wurkje jo.
It does not get better.	It wurdt net better.
Why do they eat so much?	Wêrom ite se safolle?
It makes things clear.	It makket dingen dúdlik.
But that was enough.	Mar dat wie genôch.
He could not have been good after all.	Hy koe nei gjin goed west hawwe.
You probably did not either, he was a friend of yours.	Jo wierskynlik ek net, hy wie in freon fan jo.
Has her want more.	Hat har wol mear.
Now let's get back to you.	No litte wy werom nei dy.
There is only one problem.	Der is mar ien probleem.
But he could not stop it.	Mar hy koe it net ophâlde.
But that was not the life she wanted anymore.	Mar dat wie net it libben dat se mear woe.
Children need to go to school.	Bern moatte nei skoalle.
That was three whole weeks ago.	Dat wie trije hiele wike lyn.
It's completely gone.	It is hielendal fuort.
No man.	Gjin man.
You show them differently.	Jo litte se oars sjen.
I'll give it back in a day.	Ik jou it yn in dei werom.
No one would tell me why.	Nimmen soe my fertelle wêrom.
And we are not there.	En wy binne der net.
I did not like that.	Dat fûn ik net leuk.
Of course, it's the best they should be.	Fansels is it it bêste dat se wêze moatte.
He was out of his place.	Hy wie út syn plak.
You have two problems.	Jo hawwe twa problemen.
I'm glad it's you and not me.	Ik bin bliid dat it do bist en net ik.
But otherwise he just talks.	Mar oars praat er mar.
My mom and family and friends were there.	Myn mem en famylje en freonen wiene dêr.
We do not talk long.	Wy prate net lang.
Come back in a few days.	Kom oer in pear dagen werom.
Not enough to.	Net genôch om.
But my problem is this.	Mar myn probleem is dit.
I look at them hard.	Ik sjoch se hurd oan.
If a week too late.	As in wike te let.
I know two things.	Ik ken der twa wol wat.
He was obviously not there.	Hy wie der fansels net.
Without enough food, people get sick.	Sûnder genôch iten wurde minsken siik.
He had never had much chance or reason to drive.	Hy hie nea folle kâns of reden hân om te riden.
And maybe there's another person.	En miskien is der noch in persoan.
She was angry.	Se wie lilk.
She's a good girl.	Se is in goed famke.
And maybe it is.	En miskien is it.
I know you're coming.	Ik wit dat jo komme.
I'm pretty sure of that.	Dêr bin ik frij wis fan.
I have things to do.	Ik haw dingen te dwaan.
These you really will not like.	Dizze sille jo echt net leuk fine.
You have to do something about it. 	Jo moatte der wat mei dwaan. 
are you working today ?.	wurkje jo hjoed?.
I think he is very careful not to get involved.	Ik tink dat er tige foarsichtich is om net mei te dwaan.
Wait, we need to get this right.	Wachtsje, wy moatte dit goed krije.
This will be my job.	Dit sil myn wurk wêze.
This is the big problem.	Dit is it grutte probleem.
Please, just give them some money you can.	Asjebleaft, jou har gewoan wat jild dat jo kinne.
He would not tell me the reason.	Hy soe my de reden net fertelle.
And knew her well.	En koe har goed.
I just want to make sure that's what it is.	Ik wol gewoan soargje dat dat is wat it is.
She was hours late.	Se wie oeren te let.
I would love to see that.	Dat soe ik wol graach sjen wolle.
Or which actually came.	Of hokker kom eins.
We do not get that anymore.	Dat krije wy net mear.
This may be the first of its kind.	Dit kin de earste yn syn soarte wêze.
Somehow she walks away.	Op ien of oare manier giet se fuort.
He never asked to keep her.	Hy hat noait frege har te hâlden.
Your best, good friend.	Jo bêste, goede freon.
We will get better.	Wy sille better wurde.
This should work well enough, and it does.	Dit moat wurkje goed genôch, en it docht.
So they come up with everything.	Sa komme se mei alles.
That we do not let happen.	Dat litte wy net barre.
I wanted a real house, and found one.	Ik woe in echt hûs, en fûn ien.
I took one out.	Ik naam der ien út.
Now all about.	No alles oer.
But mom did not want to.	Mar mem woe net.
This house will be old one day.	Dit hûs sil op in dei âld wurde.
He would see nothing else.	Hy soe neat oars sjen.
It's not that fun.	It is net sa leuk.
I love you, love you and will love you.	Ik hâld fan dy, haw fan dy hâlden en sil fan dy hâlde.
He's probably coming back too late after all.	Hy komt nei alle gedachten wer te let.
I should go back.	Ik soe werom moatte.
We fix the problem.	Wy meitsje it probleem.
I actually looked at nothing.	Ik seach eins neat nei.
That is as clear as it gets.	Dat is sa dúdlik as it wurdt.
But even that would not do much good now.	Mar ek dat soe no net folle goed dwaan.
They can not help it.	Se kinne it net helpe.
I knew this was true.	Ik wist dat dit wier wie.
More than enough actually.	Mear as genôch eins.
But that's good.	Mar dat is goed.
That can be us.	Dat kinne wy ​​wêze.
I want the best for my wife and children.	Ik wol it bêste foar myn frou en bern.
He could be wrong about anything.	Hy koe oer alles ferkeard wêze.
You need one.	Jo hawwe ien nedich.
I know what his job is.	Ik wit wat syn baan is.
How could you let her do that? '	Hoe koene jo har dit dwaan litte?'.
Have had some more.	Hawwe wat mear hân.
This could be over.	Dit koe oer wêze.
Maybe she knew what was coming.	Miskien wist se wat der komme soe.
Not to eat, of course.	Net te iten, fansels.
We have to think that way.	Wy moatte op dy manier tinke.
He can not help himself.	Hy kin it himsels net helpe.
I have no idea what they will do next.	Ik haw gjin idee wat se sille dwaan folgjende.
But of course he had.	Mar dat hie er fansels.
One, and she's old enough now.	Ien, en se is no âld genôch.
It just went on and on.	It gie gewoan troch en troch.
And we go.	En wy geane.
She thought he would always be a boy.	Se tocht dat er altyd in jonge wêze soe.
It like.	It like .
He looked at her.	Hy seach har oan.
I did it really well lately.	Ik die it echt goed yn 'e lêste.
She was sure he was doing it.	Se wie der wis fan dat hy it die.
Not one word to anyone about these things.	Net ien wurd oan immen oer dizze dingen.
Maybe there's a chance.	Miskien is der in kâns.
Really liked him.	Echt leuk him.
He wants you for the same reason.	Hy wol dy om deselde reden.
We now know more about that.	Dêr witte wy no mear fan.
Do nothing or try to get away with it.	Doch neat of besykje it fuort te gean.
Did you eat them? 	Hawwe jo se iten?
he asked.	hy frege.
Now we can no longer.	No kinne wy ​​net mear.
I told you so, and you do not believe.	Ik haw it jo sein, en jo leauwe net.
How can we help these people?	Hoe kinne wy ​​dizze minsken helpe?
Do not think of the man.	Tink net oan de man.
When he got home.	Doe't er thús kaam.
I know you, now.	Ik ken dy, no.
If it works for them.	As it foar har wurket.
Then we work again.	Dan wurkje wy wer.
And nothing happens.	En der bart neat.
We know they are.	Wy witte dat se binne.
I'm not really worried about that.	Ik bin der net echt soargen oer.
Nothing was enough.	Neat wie genôch.
I'm not sure we even know what that is.	Ik bin der net wis fan dat wy sels witte wat dat is.
And everyone here agrees.	En elkenien hjir is it iens.
If he had been.	As hy west hie.
Or not the time of day she wanted.	Of net de tiid fan 'e dei dat se woe.
I can not have her there today.	Ik kin har dêr hjoed net hawwe.
See it in three months maybe.	Sjoch it oer trije moanne miskien.
They know there is better.	Se witte dat der better is.
But if you know better, try to do better.	Mar as jo better witte, besykje jo better te dwaan.
I think we can do that.	Ik tink dat wy dat kinne.
I agree with you.	Ik bin it wol mei dy iens.
That's good, we've got some of that too.	Dat is goed, dêr hawwe wy ek in pear fan.
Like, more than like, like.	Like, mear as like, like.
She was sure it did.	Se wie der wis fan dat it die.
Yet another way to see it.	Noch in oare manier om it te sjen.
It's not ready yet.	It is noch net klear.
I love you more than life.	Ik hâld fan dy mear as it libben.
There needs to be much more.	Der moatte folle mear wêze.
We could do those great things.	Wy koene dy grutte dingen dwaan.
Same thing, you'll take this.	Itselde ding, jo sille dizze nimme.
I was just a boy.	Ik wie mar in jonge.
Make that three.	Meitsje dat trije.
They had not found him yet.	Se hiene him noch net fûn.
I can not today.	Ik kin hjoed net.
He would have a good job.	Hy soe in goede baan hawwe.
The couple has three children together.	It pear hat tegearre trije bern.
He lives with his wife and three children.	Hy wennet mei syn frou en trije bern.
I was the last.	Ik wie de lêste.
It does not work for me.	It wurket net foar my.
Maybe he just did.	Miskien die er net.
It must be beautiful.	It moat moai wêze.
Everyone would want to do more.	Elkenien soe mear dwaan wolle.
I did not even know what it was.	Ik wist net iens wat it wie.
Everyone said that.	Elkenien sei dat.
He looked good, she said.	Hy seach der goed út, sei se.
Happy weekend.	Goed wykein.
There were so many other problems that happened.	D'r wiene safolle oare problemen dy't barde.
It did not seem to be in place now.	It like no net te plak.
No one was made.	Gjinien waard makke.
I wanted it.	Ik hie it wol.
We need you.	Wy ha dy nedich.
A month ago, even better.	In moanne lyn, noch better.
We were there for a few hours.	Wy wiene der in pear oeren.
A kind of.	In soarte fan .
He would never be the same.	Hy soe nea itselde wêze.
He would do it.	Hy soe it dwaan.
I've been there before.	Ik haw earder west.
I've seen them once.	Ik haw se ien kear sjoen.
They will tell you what can not and why.	Se sille jo fertelle wat net kin en wêrom.
She liked them, and that was enough.	Se like har, en dat wie genôch.
A woman talking to her friend.	In frou praat mei har freon.
There was just no place to go from there.	Der wie gewoan gjin plak om dêr wei te gean.
I thought we were happy together.	Ik tocht dat wy tegearre bliid wiene.
We have to go home.	Wy moatte nei hûs.
They work hard for their money.	Se wurkje hurd foar har jild.
He was the first to attend the meeting.	Hy wie de earste dy't op 'e gearkomste kaam.
It almost seemed like not enough.	It like hast net genôch te wêzen.
You have very beautiful hair.	Do hast hiel moai hier.
I had no reason not to do it.	Ik hie gjin reden om it net te dwaan.
You have been on this road for a long time.	Jo hawwe lang op dizze wei west.
That does not happen.	Dat bart net.
Probably never, actually.	Wierskynlik nea, eins.
This was his kind of man.	Dit wie syn soarte fan man.
No one tried to take it away from him.	Nimmen besocht it fan him ôf te nimmen.
It is not always clear which.	It is net altyd dúdlik hokker.
Do not come to my room.	Kom net nei myn keamer.
Go on, please.	Gean troch, asjebleaft.
This man is doing well here.	Dizze man docht it hjir goed.
It's my family.	It is myn famylje.
Take this here.	Nim dit hjir.
She could not have.	Se koe net hawwe.
But the first wrong was not from him.	Mar it earste ferkeard wie net fan him.
Let me get that for you.	Lit my dat foar dy krije.
I bought it back.	Ik kocht it werom.
He was also happy to see her.	Hy wie ek bliid om har te sjen.
I think he's right there.	Ik tink dat hy der krekt is.
I'm scared of it.	Ik gean der bang.
He did not have much to say.	Hy hie net folle te sizzen.
None found.	Gjin fûn.
And not as much as you can.	En net folle as jo kinne.
Somehow that didn’t make her any better.	Op ien of oare manier makke dat har net better.
He was just under two years old.	Hy wie krekt ûnder twa jier âld.
You just do your job.	Jo dogge gewoan jo wurk.
Lately this has yet to happen.	De lêste tiid moat dit noch barre.
But now, it will be different.	Mar no, it sil oars.
This I just.	Dit ek net.
My mother never met my children.	Myn mem hat myn bern noait moete.
I can't live without you.	Ik kin net sûnder dy.
Do not do what my mother and I did.	Doch net wat ik en mem diene.
You make them.	Jo meitsje se.
Life was hard.	It libben wie hurd.
I knew this was big trouble.	Ik wist dat dit grutte problemen wie.
Then again, maybe he is.	Dan wer, miskien is hy.
You can never go out again.	Jo kinne noait wer út.
He will be in everything.	Hy sil yn alles wêze.
She gave it away.	Se joech it fuort.
It came and it went.	It kaam en it gie.
It could not be good.	Dit koe net goed.
They show me everything but tell me nothing.	Se litte my alles sjen, mar fertelle my neat.
But it may be too late.	Mar it kin te let wêze.
Not one they do not even know.	Net ien dy't se net iens ken.
Well, let's do this well.	No, litte wy dit goed dwaan.
It could happen again.	It koe wer barre.
Both knew the truth.	Beide wisten de wierheid.
Let's try this together and see what happens.	Lit ús dit tegearre besykje en sjen wat der bart.
It got me.	It krige my.
They would not buy anything.	Se soene neat keapje.
It was what she expected.	It wie wat se ferwachte.
She did not admit that she had been wrong.	Se joech net ta dat se ferkeard west hie.
This is no.	Dit is no.
It was not agreed last year.	It wie ferline jier net iens.
But you should not try to give it to me.	Mar jo moatte net besykje it my te jaan.
Just buy it.	Keapje it gewoan.
Do what they say.	Doch wat se sizze.
I want you to come.	Ik wol dy komme.
It was your idea to come here.	It wie dyn idee om hjir te kommen.
He had no children.	Hy hie gjin bern.
asked the boy.	frege de jonge.
You would love it.	Jo soene it leuk fine.
But that was good enough.	Mar dat wie goed genôch.
They will have to win it themselves.	Se sille it sels winne moatte.
My book is ready?	Myn boek is klear?
I have to go so bad.	Ik moat sa min gean.
Really really want to.	Echt echt wol.
It could not have happened.	It kin net bard wêze.
They could do nothing.	Se koene neat dwaan.
Everything went well until the morning.	Alles gie goed oant de moarn.
He often works from home.	Hy wurket faak thús.
There is no one else.	Der is gjinien oars.
I'm not sick.	Ik bin net siik.
She could not believe this was happening.	Se koe net leauwe dat dit bart.
That's exactly what happened.	Dat is krekt wat bard.
He looked so nice.	Hy like sa aardich.
All you can be is you.	Alles wat jo kinne wêze is jo.
You need to do something about it.	Dêr moatte jo wat oan dwaan.
There are so many things we've never talked about.	D'r binne safolle dingen wêr't wy noait oer praat hawwe.
But he did not.	Mar hy die net.
These were.	Dizze wiene.
My last week is his first.	Myn lêste wike is syn earste.
Who knows, maybe they will.	Wa wit, miskien sille se.
Not sure about that.	Net wis oer dat.
And what then.	En wat dan.
This is exactly what is on her mind.	Dit is krekt wat yn har gedachten is.
Come on.	Kom no.
It's not that hard to do.	It is net sa dreech om te dwaan.
But let's think about this.	Mar lit ús tinke oer dit.
What it did.	Wat it die.
It will be busy here.	It sil hjir drok wêze.
He walked over to his friend.	Hy rûn nei syn freon ta.
Do not ask me how.	Freegje my net hoe.
And it could be better.	En it kin better.
Tell that to no one.	Fertel dat oan gjinien.
I'll tell you something.	Ik sil dy wat fertelle.
You do not want the best of what you have seen.	Jo wolle net it bêste fan wat jo sjoen hawwe.
I saw him be scared.	Ik seach him bang wêze.
I wish you were true.	Ik winskje dat jo wier wiene.
She felt she loved them.	Se fielde dat se fan har hâlde.
Really, really nice.	Echt, echt moai.
Almost tired of him.	Hast wurch him.
I'm very, very good.	Ik bin hiel, hiel goed.
To the office.	Nei it kantoar.
He made many friends during his time there.	Hy hat yn syn tiid in protte freonen makke.
Where are we going?	Wêr geane wy ​​hinne?
You can try that.	Jo kinne dat besykje.
Same again.	Itselde wer.
I would have liked more time.	Ik hie graach mear tiid hân.
That's what she does now.	Dat docht se no.
But not everyone was so happy with it.	Mar net elkenien wie dêr sa bliid mei.
That's what they think.	Dat tinke se.
She could not get out of there.	Se koe der net út.
Much more her mother than her father.	Folle mear har mem as har heit.
I'm sure they'll get some of that.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se dêr wat fan wurde.
This is our city.	Dit is ús stêd.
It's also true that we've been here before.	It is ek wier dat wy hjir earder west hawwe.
Do not let this worry you.	Lit dit jo net soargen meitsje.
I can not get enough.	Ik kin net genôch krije.
And it was probably nothing.	En it wie wierskynlik neat.
He arrived late for the meeting.	Hy kaam te let foar de gearkomste.
I will make you happy.	Ik sil dy bliid meitsje.
Then you also go to bed.	Dan geane jo ek op bêd.
Look at us now.	Sjoch no nei ús.
She found me difficult to deal with.	Se fûn my dreech om mei om te gean.
They're coming back.	Se komme werom.
They are just there, and they are what they are.	Se binne gewoan dêr, en se binne wat se binne.
We're just in there.	Wy binne der gewoan yn.
This was very well done.	Dit wie tige goed dien.
It would have been nice to have a dog.	It soe moai west hawwe om in hûn te hawwen.
Not sure what the problem is.	Net wis wat it probleem is.
Be very careful!	Wês tige foarsichtich!
I'm the only one who can do it.	Ik bin de iennichste dy't it kin.
I really need to work on that.	Dêr soe ik echt oan wurkje moatte.
On day two.	Op dei twa.
Nothing goes in, nothing goes out.	Der giet neat yn, neat giet út.
He is holding a book in his hand.	Hy hâldt in boek yn 'e hân.
I love those two things, too.	Ik hâld fan dy beide dingen, te.
Either wake up or something.	Of wekker wurde of sa.
I come here for work.	Ik kom hjir foar wurk.
I will even.	Ik sil sels noch.
All at three.	Allegear op trije.
If they can be found.	As se te finen binne.
That and that there was one with me.	Dat en dat wie der ien by my.
I do not even know how that can be.	Ik wit net iens hoe't dat kin.
You have no plan.	Jo hawwe gjin plan.
It's easy to see why.	It is maklik om te sjen wêrom.
Everyone who is someone is there.	Elkenien dy't immen is, is der.
not yet.	noch net.
With my children.	Mei myn bern.
There will be more to come.	Der komme wol mear.
Things are working out well.	Dingen wurkje goed.
But it does not seem likely.	Mar it liket net wierskynlik.
Hold me tight.	Hâld my hurd.
Plenty of.	In protte.
He's like a child.	Hy is as in bern.
Does anyone know what?	Wit immen wat?
You have to help.	Jo moatte helpe.
The teacher was not happy to see him.	De learaar wie net bliid om him te sjen.
There will always be.	Der sil altyd wêze.
Or maybe it is not.	Of miskien is it net.
You were the one who told us about him.	Jo wiene dejinge dy't ús oer him fertelde.
It was so long ago.	It wie sa lang lyn.
That time is now.	Dy tiid is no.
Take him and see if he has money.	Nim him en sjoch oft er jild hat.
Wait for him.	Wachtsje op him.
She would not see that he loved her.	Se soe net sjen dat er fan har hâlde.
He wants me to keep my job.	Hy wol dat ik myn wurk hâld.
Three days ago.	Trije dagen lyn.
I did it.	Ik haw it dien.
That was mine we have.	Dat wie myn wy hawwe.
There is nothing to worry about, nothing to be afraid of.	D'r is neat te soargen oer, neat om bang te wêzen.
She saw how someone came.	Se seach hoe't der ien kaam.
I know about you, but I'm not coming to town much anymore.	Ik wit fan dy, mar kom net folle mear yn 'e stêd.
But they are there.	Mar se binne der.
More on this soon.	Mear oer dit gau.
That, she asked me.	Dat, se frege my.
The money is not mine.	It jild is net fan my.
Many questions remain.	Noch in protte fragen bliuwe.
He's not worried.	Hy is net soargen.
He was out for days.	Hy wie der dagen út.
Before he died.	Foardat er stoar.
I know who.	Ik wit wa.
And then tired.	En dan wurch.
Who owns this house?	Wa hat dit hûs?
That is very clear to her.	Dat is har hiel dúdlik.
And this is why.	En dit is wêrom.
But she had to.	Mar se moast.
It's not that easy.	It is net sa maklik.
I feel so much better.	It giet my safolle better.
You can no longer be wrong.	Jo kinne net mear ferkeard wêze.
But there is a good reason for that.	Mar dêr is in goede reden foar.
It will be better for everyone.	It sil better wêze foar elkenien.
I know you did not.	Ik wit dat jo net dien hawwe.
Anyway, at least we didn't go down without explaining ourselves first.	Hoe dan ek, wy prate noch wat.
He will hurt me.	Hy sil my sear dwaan.
It's not really my thing.	It is net echt myn ding.
Hope you enjoyed reading this.	Hoopje dat jo dit leuk hawwe lêzen.
Well, maybe him.	No, miskien him.
When he was seen.	As er sjoen waard.
Otherwise we are back to where we started.	Oars binne wy ​​werom nei wêr't wy begûn binne.
She is free to do so.	Se is frij om dat te dwaan.
It will be just before tonight.	It sil gewoan foar fannacht wêze.
They have not yet started work.	Se binne noch net oan it wurk begûn.
He had done this.	Hy hie dit dien.
I'm sorry for that.	It spyt my foar de.
Still don't get it.	Noch altyd net krije it.
She says her teacher will probably keep it.	Se seit dat har learaar it wierskynlik hâlde sil.
But no one does that.	Mar nimmen docht dat.
I think it would have worked.	Ik tink dat it soe hawwe wurke.
Very few people are good at this.	Hiel pear minsken binne goed yn dit.
Last year is in the past.	Ferline jier is yn it ferline.
There it is done.	Dêr is it dien.
He could not get over it.	Hy koe der net oer.
That will be fine.	Dat sil goed.
You are my only hope.	Do bist myn ienige hope.
Nobody lived there anymore.	Dêr wenne gjinien mear.
It has a lot to say.	It hat in protte te sizzen.
I could not put them in place.	Ik koe se net yn plak sette.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Fertel my asjebleaft wat der bard is.
I have something to say.	Ik haw wat te sizzen.
You have to stay away from me.	Jo moatte fan my ôf bliuwe.
That's how it's given to him.	Dat is hoe't it him jûn wurdt.
It was just almost too much, for some reason.	It wie gewoan hast te folle, om ien of oare reden.
They take care of each other.	Se soargje foar elkoar.
We are better than this.	Wy binne better as dit.
It went on and on.	It gie troch en troch.
It's such a place.	It is sa'n plak.
Like, of course.	Graach, fansels.
But he will not.	Mar hy sil net.
That's how we know what would happen.	Dat is hoe't wy witte wat der barre soe.
I never want to be friends with you!	Ik wol noait freonen mei dy wêze!
I will stay with you.	Ik sil by dy bliuwe.
It would be enough for me to stay clear.	It soe genôch wêze foar my om dúdlik te bliuwen.
I'm thirty years old.	Ik bin tritich jier âld.
He just kept doing what he did.	Hy bleau gewoan dwaan wat er die.
I feel very happy.	Ik fiel my tige bliid.
The problem is not what they say, but what they do not say.	It probleem is net wat se sizze, mar wat se net sizze.
It all came true.	It kaam allegear wier.
I looked him up.	Ik seach him wol op.
She never went back to school.	Se gie nea werom nei skoalle.
And boy, do they ever do that.	En jonge, dogge se ea.
She went on.	Se gie troch.
I was surprised she could talk.	Ik wie ferrast dat se prate koe.
Net.	Net.
I wanted to get out of there.	Ik woe dêr fuort.
To the big house.	Nei it grutte hûs.
That could not be otherwise.	Dat koe net oars.
Not about prison.	Net oer finzenis.
Look at that.	Sjoch derop.
But it almost never happens.	Mar it bart hast nea.
I thought it was you.	Ik tocht dat it dy wie.
But now you know it will.	Mar no witte jo it wol.
So, the name.	Sa, de namme.
What more do we need, really.	Wat hawwe wy mear nedich, echt.
I once went to this school.	Ik gie eartiids nei dizze skoalle.
Ask them to figure it out.	Freegje se om it út te finen.
Keep them coming !.	Hâld se komme!.
They had both tried.	Se hiene beide besocht.
He has no chance.	Hy hat gjin kâns.
We talked about it.	Wy hawwe it der oer hân.
We love each other.	Wy hâlde fan elkoar.
Everything you need for.	Alles wat jo nedich hawwe foar.
There must be something she could do to help him.	Der moat wat wêze dat se dwaan koe om him te helpen.
He thought no one knew.	Hy tocht dat nimmen it wist.
And that's me.	En dat die er ek.
And you know, we can not make too much of this.	En jo witte, wy kinne hjir net te folle fan meitsje.
I would love to go.	Ik soe graach gean.
Give it a week.	Jou it in wike.
I'm determined to make one.	Ik bin besletten om ien te meitsjen.
I do not know about it.	Ik wit der net fan.
But it will not help.	Mar it sil net helpe.
They would do it.	Se soene it dwaan.
Enter him and you are ready.	Jou him oan en do bist klear.
I do not know that we have ever had the opportunity.	Ik wit net dat wy oait de kâns krigen hawwe.
As if it had not really happened.	As wie it net echt bard.
People love him.	Minsken hâlde fan him.
This was his day.	Dit wie syn dei.
Come back.	Kom werom.
He will not like it, he said.	Hy sil it net leuk fine, sei er.
But that's not it.	Mar dat is it net.
One thing we can never get back is time.	Ien ding kinne wy ​​nea werom krije is tiid.
It's the right thing to do.	It is it goede ding om te dwaan.
I was looking at it now.	Ik seach der no nei.
And that's just it.	En dat is krekt it.
Never fear, there are things you can do too.	Nea bang, d'r binne dingen dy't jo ek dwaan kinne.
Well, actually, it does not matter to me.	No, eins makket it my neat út.
She did not have to be there.	Se hoegde der net te wêzen.
I wanna see you.	Ik wol dy sjen.
It's very, very difficult.	It is hiel, hiel dreech.
She did not know what she wanted to say.	Se wist net wat se sizze woe.
You will not tell me what to do.	Jo sille my net fertelle wat ik dwaan moat.
I never get tired of it.	Ik wurd der noait wurch fan.
I have read things here and there.	Ik haw hjir en dêr dingen lêzen.
It is good for the child.	It is goed foar it bern.
But she knows it.	Mar se wit it.
It did not matter how much they wanted to be together.	It makke net út hoefolle oft se tegearre wolle.
I have tried, but there seems to be.	Ik haw besocht, mar d'r liket te wêzen.
Nobody knows the reason.	Nimmen wit de reden.
Just for an hour.	Krekt foar in oere.
We drove for hours.	Wy hawwe oeren riden.
That was how he met her.	Dat wie hoe't er har moete.
No one has ever told me.	Nimmen hat my oait ferteld.
You need to be able to do these things.	Jo moatte dizze dingen dwaan kinne.
I can do this.	Ik kin dit dwaan.
It's about what they're doing from now on.	It giet om wat se fan no ôf dogge.
I never really thought about how it got there.	Ik haw noait echt tocht oer hoe't it dêr kaam.
This is your being and being sure.	Dit is jo wêzen en wis wêze.
It's not an easy thing to do.	It is gjin maklik ding.
This is how you should do it.	Dit is hoe't jo it moatte dwaan.
And he liked me.	En hy mocht my graach.
Well, this one is a little different.	No, dizze is in bytsje oars.
But, that's what's happening.	Mar, dat is wat der bart.
There's a place I want to go back to.	D'r is in plak wêr't ik werom wol.
She has nothing to do with it, nothing to do with it.	Dêr hat se neat mei, dêr neat mei.
I just can not stop with this book.	Ik kin gewoan net ophâlde mei dit boek.
Neither is for children.	Gjin fan beide is foar bern.
I was fine with that.	Ik wie der goed mei.
I think that's the last thing we need.	Ik tink dat dat it lêste is dat wy nedich binne.
But tell me about you.	Mar fertel my oer dy.
They do not love him enough.	Se hâlde net genôch fan him.
Most likely she will be happy.	Wierskynlik sil se bliid wêze.
We still have this.	Wy hawwe dit noch.
We have resolved these questions.	Wy hawwe dizze fragen besletten.
Nothing much he could do until then.	Neat folle koe er oant dan ta.
She did not want to return.	Se woe net werom.
Every day there were new things to see.	Alle dagen wiene der nije dingen te sjen.
Come in here.	Kom hjir yn.
You make us wait for the bus!	Jo litte ús wachtsje op de bus!
No one was, like it.	Gjinien wiene, like it.
What she said is true.	Wat se sei is wier.
But that day never came.	Mar dy dei kaam nea.
He could not put himself in her place.	Hy koe him net op har plak sette.
We'll keep that in mind next time.	Dat hâlde wy de folgjende kear yn gedachten.
I'm sure you'll do well.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo it goed sille dwaan.
Sure, he had no time.	Wis, hy hie gjin tiid.
It was good that he did.	It wie goed dat er dat die.
This must stop.	Dit moat ophâlde.
So many of my friends have none.	Safolle fan myn freonen hawwe gjin.
Maybe nothing could.	Miskien koe neat.
It's time for you to go.	It is tiid foar jo om te gean.
Now it's gone.	No is it fuort.
Will have a job here.	Sil hawwe in baan hjir.
She walked to the room and opened the door.	Se rûn nei de keamer en die de doar iepen.
She thinks she's coming back.	Se tinke dat se werom komt.
I'm scared to go out.	Ik bin bang om út te gean.
She does not want to know a name.	Se wol gjin namme witte.
Your wife is not sick.	Dyn frou is net siik.
There was no money for that.	Dêr wie gjin jild foar.
You're still my child.	Do bist noch altyd myn bern.
But, this one does.	Mar, dizze docht.
I felt a little bad.	Ik fielde my wat min.
That was until this year.	Dat wie oant dit jier.
At first she was really nice.	Earst wie se echt aardich.
This is what happened here last night.	Dit is wat hjir fannacht bard is.
I do not know how to do this.	Ik wit net hoe't ik dit meitsje moat.
I'm as tired as a dog.	Ik bin sa wurch as in hûn.
This can not happen.	Dit kin net barre.
I would still have my kids.	Ik soe myn bern noch hawwe.
They say it just seemed like a movie only better.	Se sizze dat it like krekt as in film allinnich better.
We do it all much better.	Wy dogge it allegear folle better.
There is only one problem.	Der is mar ien probleem.
He told me not to get him anything.	Hy fertelde my om him neat te krijen.
He left me alone.	Hy liet my allinnich.
It was hard to tell.	It wie dreech te fertellen.
You have to go at once.	Jo moatte yn ien kear gean.
I had not seen him for hours.	Ik hie him al oeren net sjoen.
No room, no bed.	Gjin keamer, in bêd.
And so would they.	En dy soene ek.
She will go home when the work is done.	Se sil nei hûs as it wurk klear is.
Nothing is ever enough.	Neat is oait genôch.
It was something to say.	It wie wat te sizzen.
Words don’t really matter.	Wurden dogge net echt út.
That's it for today.	Dat is it foar hjoed.
I was beautiful.	Ik wie moai.
He would get him one day.	Hy soe him op in dei krije.
Nothing ever came out of nowhere.	Gjin ding kaam ea út it neat.
That seems difficult.	Dat liket dreech.
He knows the place well.	Hy ken it plak goed.
They do not know that.	Dat witte se net.
He passed it on to me.	Hy joech it my troch.
He had been good to me.	Hy hie goed foar my west.
You can never tell.	Jo kinne nea fertelle.
We have too much to do.	Wy hawwe te folle te dwaan.
Not so in this book.	Net sa yn dit boek.
I ran some more.	Ik rûn noch wat.
And there may be some truth in that.	En d'r kin wat wierheid yn wêze.
She wants to be here.	Se wol hjir wêze.
I was just scared.	Ik wie gewoan bang.
I thought it would never stop.	Ik tocht dat it soe nea ophâlde.
They do the best they can.	Se dogge it bêste dat se kinne.
She was very nice.	Se wie hiel aardich.
I feel it there to this day.	Ik fiel it dêr oant hjoed de dei.
They will play for hours.	Se sille oeren spylje.
One day.	Ien dei.
You now know what you are.	Jo witte no wat jo binne.
To be.	Wêze.
Better not see too often.	Better net te faak sjen.
I'm actually very good.	Ik bin eins hiel goed.
But he did not do much work.	Mar hy die net folle wurk.
I know him so well.	Ik ken him sa goed.
He arrived just when they were ready to eat.	Hy kaam krekt doe't se klear wiene mei iten.
I'm not sure there's anything else.	Ik bin der net wis fan dat der wat oars.
I did not agree.	Ik wie it net iens.
You will not get in trouble.	Jo sille net yn de problemen komme.
To do that one more time.	Om dat noch ien kear te dwaan.
'has got'.	'hat'.
Nobody knew what to do.	Nimmen wist wat te dwaan.
But this is not about that.	Mar dit giet der net oer.
He has a job.	Hy hat in baan.
He also knew nothing of anything else.	Hy wist ek neat fan oars.
She became a teacher.	Se waard learaar.
Let me tell you what happened.	Lit my dy fertelle wat der bard is.
I do not even know what it is.	Ik wit net iens wat it is.
She looked at him.	Se seach nei him.
This would happen soon.	Dit soe gau barre.
Then up again.	Dan wer op.
And about.	En oer.
They are not entirely wrong.	Se binne net hielendal ferkeard.
I gave you every chance.	Ik joech dy alle kâns.
The new man got an office.	De nije man krige in kantoar.
It may not be a good one, but it is there.	It kin net in goede, mar it is der.
Not such a thing.	Net sa'n ding.
They have no reason to.	Se hawwe gjin reden om.
Not good so far.	Net goed oant no.
Let's have a plan.	Litte wy in plan hawwe.
Give him your seat, please.	Jou him dyn sit, asjebleaft.
It is now a '.	It is no in'.
Let's first see how we deal with this.	Litte wy earst sjen hoe't wy mei dizze dogge.
She was different.	Se wie oars.
I did not think so.	Ik tocht net.
And they help each other.	En se helpe elkoar.
It did, but only slightly.	It die, mar mar in bytsje.
This is how it goes here.	Dit is hoe't it hjir giet.
I should have stayed with him.	Ik hie by him bliuwe moatten.
Hope you come back often !.	Hoopje dat jo komme werom faak!.
It is not thought.	It wurdt net tocht.
It was not enough.	It wie net genôch.
What exactly happened is not entirely clear.	Wat der krekt bard is, is net hielendal dúdlik.
You never know until you try.	Jo witte noait oant jo besykje.
You are the one who is not.	Jo binne dejinge dy't net is.
They will be easy.	Se sille maklik wêze.
I had an idea.	Ik hie in idee.
Something can happen once.	Der kin ien kear wat barre.
I can ask my friend.	Ik kin myn freon freegje.
You work as you please.	Jo wurkje as jo wolle.
They never met again.	Se moete nea wer.
I had it, and it had me.	Ik hie it, en it hie my.
You can stay as long as you want.	Jo kinne bliuwe sa lang as jo wolle.
They want to put him in jail.	Se wolle him yn de finzenis sette.
You and the others are not worried about me.	Jo en de oare binne my gjin soargen.
He ran in front of me.	Hy rûn my foar.
Keep away from children.	Hâld fuort fan bern.
You made a man of me.	Jo hawwe in man fan my makke.
We tried everything.	Wy hawwe alles besocht.
There we go.	Dêr geane wy ​​hinne.
I have tried and tried.	Ik haw besocht en besocht.
It all happens.	It bart allegear.
It will do.	It sil dwaan.
To come to me.	Om my te kommen.
You're too nice, she says.	Do bist te aardich, seit se.
That's what she's through.	Dat docht se troch.
Not that she could.	Net dat se koe.
Are you happy with your life?	Binne jo bliid mei jo libben?
I walked by.	Ik rûn troch.
That they said this is why we did these things.	Dat se seine dat dit is wêrom wy dizze dingen diene.
This is too late to be out.	Dit is let om út te wêzen.
But well, let's leave it at that.	Mar goed, litte wy it litte.
That is not true either.	Dat is ek net wier.
And about us.	En oer ús.
City after city.	Stêd nei stêd.
We did not have much time.	Wy hiene net folle tiid.
For one or more hours.	Foar ien of mear oeren.
They eat almost nothing.	Se ite hast neat.
Something needs to be done about this tomorrow.	Der moat moarn wat oan dien wurde.
One thing is for sure.	Ien ding is mar wis.
I'm actually almost there.	Ik bin der eins hast.
Try something else.	Besykje wat oars.
There was always the next time.	Der wie altyd de folgjende kear.
Of course, it's a bit early, not much.	Fansels is it wat betiid, net folle.
What has that got to do with it.	Wat hat dat mei te krijen.
Of course, your home is yours.	Fansels is jo hûs fan jo.
I came back to my room.	Ik kaam werom yn myn keamer.
Then he does it again.	Dan docht er it wer.
Please let us know how it goes.	Lit ús asjebleaft witte hoe't it giet.
And that's what we'll do.	En dat sille wy dwaan.
She wanted to see her friend.	Se woe har freon sjen.
That's very.	Dat is tige.
There are too many.	Der binne te folle.
The man has been there for you your whole life.	De man is der dyn hiele libben foar dy.
Got it wrong the first time.	Krige it ferkeard de earste kear.
We make bad people out of it.	Wy meitsje minne minsken der goed út.
I knew that long ago.	Dat wist ik lang lyn.
There is no such thing as ready.	Der is net sa'n ding as klear.
You can support your family through that.	Jo kinne jo famylje troch dat.
So far she has not.	Oant no ta hat se net.
I'm trying not to do it, he said.	Ik besykje it net te dwaan, sei er.
Maybe he was scared too.	Miskien wie er ek bang.
Let nothing else make you think.	Lit neat jo oars tinke.
Let’s hope they can do better.	Litte wy hoopje dat se better kinne.
Whoever has nothing, wants something.	Wa't neat hat, wol wat.
She always told him everything.	Se fertelde him altyd alles.
He looked away from me.	Hy seach fan my ôf.
You do not get out of there.	Jo komme der net ôf.
It was still early.	It wie noch betiid.
Can anyone help me the better way.	Kin ien my de bettere manier helpe.
People love me.	Minsken hâlde fan my.
Something needs to be done about this.	Hjir moat wat oan dien wurde.
I really did not get along so well.	Ik kaam der echt net sa goed by.
You have to do that yourself.	Dat moatte jo sels dwaan.
It's pretty late.	It is frij let.
I'm not the only one watching now.	Ik bin net de iennichste dy't no sjocht.
Did she expect it?	Hat se ferwachte?
This was first.	Dit wie earst.
Why is this happening?	Wêrom bart dit?
We are all very concerned about these issues.	Wy binne allegear tige soargen oer dizze problemen.
But you did this to me.	Mar do hast my dit dien.
But there was not much.	Mar der wie net folle.
Only one can help.	Allinnich ien kin helpe.
It seemed to him a good enough plan.	It like him in goed genôch plan.
I want you to go back to bed now.	Ik wol dat jo no wer op bêd geane.
I know how that works.	Ik wit hoe't dat wurket.
Not even a bit.	Net iens in bytsje.
We'll see if that holds.	Wy sille sjen oft dat hâldt.
I had been there myself.	Ik hie der sels west.
He could only see.	Hy koe allinnich sjen.
No problem there.	Gjin probleem dêr.
Maybe they would make it through this.	Miskien soene se it troch dit meitsje.
I liked going to bed with him.	Ik gie graach mei him op bêd.
She felt the same about him.	Se fielde itselde oer him.
You can even say something.	Jo kinne sels wat sizze.
The man looked tall and cautious.	De man seach lang en foarsichtich.
I can not let people come to the door.	Ik kin net dat minsken by de doar komme.
I have never been so happy with something in my life.	Ik wie noch noait sa bliid mei wat yn myn libben.
But things are not as different as they seem.	Mar dingen binne net sa oars as se lykje.
I have to look at it that way.	Ik moat der sa nei sjen.
Maybe she would know something.	Miskien soe se wat witte.
I was still sick.	Ik wie noch siik.
That should help.	Dat moat helpe.
She was not even sure why she was so angry.	Se wie net iens wis wêrom't se sa lilk wie.
It's pretty ordinary.	It is frij gewoan.
It's so easy you can do it now.	It is sa maklik dat jo it no kinne dwaan.
It's not like it's out of his way or anything.	It is net sa dat it út syn wei is of sa.
Do not tell anyone else what you found.	Fertel gjinien oars wat jo fûn hawwe.
They have the best of the best.	Se hawwe it bêste fan it bêste.
she asked.	frege se har ôf.
It's not much, but we find it.	It is net folle, mar wy fine it.
I could never buy what she said.	Ik koe noait keapje wat se sei.
He was the one who was waiting for her.	Hy wie dejinge dy't oer har wachte.
This should have happened to you enough.	Dit moat jo genôch bard wêze.
I'm sure someone can find them.	Ik bin der wis fan dat immen se fine kin.
And you're wrong.	En do bist ferkeard.
You do the same thing.	Jo dogge itselde ding.
I assume he hurt.	Ik nim oan dat er sear dien hat.
They're in the bad way here.	Se binne yn 'e minne manier hjir.
I know she does not want a family yet.	Ik wit dat se noch gjin famylje wol.
You have to give them much more than that.	Jo moatte jaan se folle mear as dat.
People find their way here.	Minsken fine har wei hjir.
We love what we do.	Wy hâlde fan wat wy dogge.
Or his parents.	Of syn âlden.
I have things to do.	Ik haw dingen te dwaan.
There will never be more.	D'r sil noait mear wêze.
Going to work today was not easy.	Oan it wurk gean hjoed wie net maklik.
I think we made that clear.	Ik tink dat wy dat dúdlik makke hawwe.
Once upon a time this life had been.	Eartiids hie dit libben west.
For me, what is mine is.	Foar my is wat myn is.
Plan to do it again next year.	Plan om it takom jier wer te dwaan.
I gave this back.	Ik joech dit werom.
Many, many, many more.	In protte, folle, mear.
I would very much like that.	Dat soe ik tige wol.
He used to live here, but not anymore.	Hy wenne hjir eartiids, mar net mear.
I've never seen it this late in the year.	Ik haw it noch noait sa let yn it jier sjoen.
To hold! 	Hâlde!
I'm doing it right.	Ik doch it goed.
He has the same problems as everyone else.	Hy hat deselde problemen as elkenien oars.
Who was not in there.	Wa wie der net yn.
That really hurt me.	Dat die my echt sear.
He was glad he did not.	Hy wie bliid dat er it net die.
see in the movie.	sjoch yn 'e film.
No one saw him do it.	Nimmen seach him it dwaan.
Let your friends know that you care about them.	Lit jo freonen witte dat jo oan har tinke.
Now his bed has become a prison.	No is syn bêd in finzenis wurden.
But you are different.	Mar do bist oars.
I need to know who did this.	Ik moat witte wa't dit dien hat.
They were very angry.	Se wiene tige lilk.
I had one hope.	Ik hie ien hope.
Even worked on a movie.	Sels wurke oan in film.
She seemed happy.	Se like bliid.
There is not much to do.	Der is net folle te dwaan.
Maybe even want three.	Miskien sels wol trije.
And he knew I was too.	En hy wist dat ik ek wie.
But she is not the best.	Mar se is net de bêste.
It will help her with her life.	It sil har helpe mei har libben.
You can even see that there is nothing more with me.	Jo kinne sels sjen dat der neat mear mei my is.
She's on him.	Se is op him.
I knew all along.	Ik wist de hiele tiid.
It must be hard.	It moat dreech wêze.
She should not, not until she speaks.	Se moat net, net oant se praat.
You can handle it.	Jo kinne it oan.
He wants a family.	Hy wol in famylje.
She still needs money for everything.	Se hat noch jild foar alles nedich.
I'm the dog.	Ik bin de hûn.
I had food and water.	Ik hie iten en wetter.
Maybe that's not the best way to do it.	Miskien is dat net de bêste manier om it te dwaan.
It was not good.	It wie net goed.
What do you have ?.	Hokker hawwe jo?.
And that was really what we were after.	En dat wie echt wat wy wiene nei.
I'll see you before the week is over.	Ik sil dy sjen foardat de wike om is.
I just kind of knew.	Ik krekt soarte fan wist.
Let the children.	Lit de bern.
He knew he could not win.	Hy wist dat er net winne koe.
We are here, and we will stay here.	Wy binne hjir, en wy sille bliuwe hjir.
There is nothing to be afraid of.	D'r is neat om bang foar te wêzen.
See, it's so.	Sjoch, it is sa.
But look in the car.	Mar sjoch yn 'e auto.
Also in the car.	Ek yn de auto.
Go into the other room.	Gean yn 'e oare keamer.
I better get back to mom.	Ik kin better werom nei mem.
We did not really know where we were.	Wy wisten net echt wêr't wy wiene.
He does not eat much.	Hy yt net folle.
She was even happy.	Se wie sels bliid.
And maybe she had been.	En miskien hie se west.
She was happy.	Se wie bliid.
He was sure he had never seen this before.	Hy wie der wis fan dat er dizze noch noait earder sjoen hie.
I had my life back.	Ik hie myn libben werom.
If you do not know.	As jo ​​it net witte.
This day would be good.	Dizze dei soe goed wurde.
I'm telling you what I've been told.	Ik fertel dy wat my ferteld is.
I just want it.	Ik wol it gewoan.
No one here is ever happy.	Nimmen is hjir oait bliid.
We need them both.	Wy hawwe se beide nedich.
It's just.	It is gewoan.
But still fun.	Mar noch altyd leuk.
I should be ready by now.	Ik soe no klear wêze moatte.
She does not want to be here yet.	Wol se hjir noch net.
I want to talk to her mother.	Ik wol mei har mem prate.
Now hand him over to me.	Jou him no oan my oer.
I had to come home and make food.	Ik moast thús komme en iten meitsje.
He had everything he could ever wish for.	Hy hie alles wat er oait winskje koe.
Then they would be in there again.	Dan soene se der wer yn.
I was just a kid, nobody told me anything.	Ik wie mar in bern, nimmen fertelde my wat.
If so, he would take it.	As dat sa is, soe hy it nimme.
I love you and everything.	Ik hâld fan dy en alles.
That’s kind of what it seems to be happening.	Dat is sa'n bytsje wat it liket te bart.
He was not ready for that.	Dêr wie er net klear foar.
This is very good.	Dit is hiel goed.
That's a lot of hard work.	Dat is in protte hurd wurk.
For now, let's leave this as an open issue.	Foar no litte wy dit as in iepen probleem.
If they do, then good for you.	As se dogge, dan goed foar jo.
Faith is hard.	Leauwe is dreech.
It's pretty much just real.	It is frij gewoan echt.
I just love how beautiful real food is.	Ik hâld gewoan fan hoe moai echt iten is.
We are not doing this now.	Wy dogge dit no net.
En.	En.
You will see it again.	Jo sille it wer sjen.
When it's open, let's win the best idea.	As it iepen is, lit it bêste idee winne.
Things were good.	Dingen wiene goed.
She knew better.	Se wist better.
I need to show you something.	Ik moat dy wat sjen litte.
You do so.	Jo dogge sa.
Everyone was happy.	Elkenien wie bliid.
I've been seeing you for two years.	Ik sjoch dy al twa jier.
She's coming up.	Se komt op.
One thing is here that he has never seen before.	In ding is hjir dat er noch nea earder sjoen hat.
But he wanted to know more.	Mar hy woe mear witte.
I actually totally agree with you.	Ik bin it eins hielendal iens mei dy.
I went home and told my dad.	Ik gie nei hûs en fertelde myn heit.
I've heard so much.	Ik haw safolle heard.
This may have been true.	Dit kin wier west hawwe.
If only they could.	As se mar kinne.
She had not.	Se hie net.
There is nothing like a good book.	D'r is neat as in goed boek.
I do not think he was.	Ik tink net dat hy wie.
We really love it.	Wy hâlde it echt.
Be kind to your children.	Wês aardich foar jo bern.
What she needed would be there, and enough.	Wat se nedich wie, soe der wêze, en genôch.
May it be so.	Mei it sa wêze.
She waited and waited and waited.	Se wachte en wachte en wachte.
He made you think.	Hy liet dy tinke.
She seemed to be happy.	Se like bliid te wêzen.
I'm very happy to see you again.	Ik bin tige bliid dy wer te sjen.
Has nothing and does not really work towards anything.	Hat neat en wurket net echt nei wat ta.
I've been told that my whole life, and it's true.	Ik haw al ferteld dat myn hiele libben, en it is wier.
I'm talking now.	Ik praat no wol út.
There's no one out here.	Der is gjinien út hjir.
We'll go to work.	Wy sille oan it wurk gean.
There was nothing else.	Der wie neat oars.
And that's just wrong.	En dat is gewoan ferkeard.
And no one really wants that.	En gjinien wol dat eins.
The only thing.	It ienige ding.
We will come soon to help.	Wy komme gau te helpen.
Just really hard.	Krekt echt dreech.
You may have heard of me too.	Jo hawwe miskien ek fan my heard.
In fact, there are many more than two.	Eins binne d'r folle mear as twa.
So we do it.	Sa dogge wy it.
She can be totally into you and not show it.	Se kin hielendal yn jo wêze en it net sjen litte.
I can see what's going on around him.	Ik kin sjen wat der om him bart.
But, just, it did not work.	Mar, gewoan, it wurke net.
Water, water and more water!	Wetter, wetter en mear wetter!
You know it's the truth.	Jo witte dat it de wierheid is.
I know what they did.	Ik wit wat se dien hawwe.
You would not know it.	Jo soene it net witte.
On just one day a year, the two are the same.	Op mar ien dei yn it jier binne de twa itselde.
It did not work for any of us.	It wurke net foar ien fan ús.
They are not quite sure what is going on.	Se binne der net hielendal wis fan wat der bart.
The boy looked tired.	De jonge seach wurch.
But one day you may get sick.	Mar ien dei kinne jo siik wurde.
No one was happy.	Nimmen wie bliid.
That is not true.	Dat is net wier.
You're a busy man.	Do bist in drok man.
I wanted to know why that child had decided to stop talking.	Ik woe witte wêrom't dat bern besletten hie op te hâlden mei praten.
There are days that are difficult.	Der binne dagen dy't dreech binne.
It can be from him, it can be from you.	It kin fan him wêze, it kin fan jo wêze.
And maybe then we would not hurt so much.	En miskien soene wy ​​dan net safolle sear dwaan.
You're in bed.	Do bist op bêd.
Dad has been working there every day since that day.	Heit hat dêr sûnt dy dei alle dagen wurke.
I just want to know what they're saying.	Ik wol krekt witte wat se sizze.
No one had.	Gjinien hie.
That's giving.	Dat is jaan.
And you would be right here too.	En jo soene hjir ek krekt wêze.
He had to be good.	Hy moast goed wêze.
He did not want me to tell you.	Hy woe net dat ik it dy fertel.
Let me make that clear.	Lit my dat dúdlik meitsje.
They would go to the city.	Se soene nei de stêd ta.
But he knew what to do.	Mar hy wist wat te dwaan.
There is no other way around this.	D'r is gjin oare manier om dit hinne.
I have never heard such a thing.	Ik haw noch noait sa'n ding heard.
Think about it now.	Tink dêr no oan.
I never thought they would show up.	Ik nea tocht dat se soene sjen litte.
This you will see.	Dit sille jo sjen.
She had never seen it before.	Se hie it noch noait earder sjoen.
But that was not her.	Mar dat wie se net.
I do not like to be wrong.	Ik hâld der net fan om ferkeard te wêzen.
Someone has to pay for all this work.	Immen moat betelje foar al dit wurk.
You know, with the girl.	Jo witte, mei it famke.
They could not help us.	Se koene ús net helpe.
To give her what she wanted.	Om har te jaan wat se woe.
We have the good people.	Wy hawwe de goede minsken.
This last bit.	Dit lêste bytsje.
Maybe he shouldn’t be so hard on her.	Miskien moat er har net sa hurd wêze.
They did a pretty good job though.	Se diene wol aardich goed wurk.
Nothing else on it.	Neat oars op it.
It was good.	It wie goed.
But he would, of course.	Mar hy soe fansels.
I'll tell you where he's gone.	Ik sil dy fertelle wêr't er fuort is.
Not sure how that happened.	Net wis hoe't dat barde.
He knows what really happened.	Hy wit wat der echt bard wie.
I just did not know.	Ik wist it gewoan net.
I should never have come here.	Ik hie hjir noait komme moatten.
It's work, it's a work.	It is wurk, it is in wurk.
I do not know if it is true or not.	Ik wit net oft it wier is of net.
You're really beautiful.	Do bist echt moai.
He got the first one.	Hy krige de earste.
No one else can get there.	Nimmen oars kin der oan komme.
I speak clearly now.	Ik praat no dúdlik.
He got so tired.	Hy waard sa wurch.
It was pretty sick.	It wie aardich siik.
Today, everyone does everything.	Hjoed docht elkenien alles.
The time has not come for that.	Dêr is de tiid net foar kommen.
But he did, and it was.	Mar hy die, en it wie.
If you do not want to go.	As jo ​​​​net wolle gean.
Now he was sure something had happened.	No wie er wis dat der wat bard wie.
They are all different.	Se binne allegear oars.
She will do very well.	Se sil it hiel goed dwaan.
What are those things?	Wat binne dy dingen?
A best friend.	In bêste freon.
Of course they are not.	Fansels binne se net.
Everyone has an idea.	Elkenien hat wol in idee.
What did he say?	Wat sei hy?
I do not want to do it.	Ik wol it net dwaan.
A great job.	In grutte baan.
Same with his.	Itselde mei syn.
I was fun.	Ik wie leuk.
And that's happening here.	En dat bart hjir.
He would see.	Hy soe sjen.
I turned her around.	Ik makke har der om.
This is a family here.	Dit is in famylje hjir.
I'm not awake yet.	Ik bin noch net wekker.
I hope so.	Ik hoopje it.
I just made it.	Ik haw it krekt makke.
Go back to work.	Gean werom oan it wurk.
Not really.	No net echt.
She loves her father.	Se hâldt fan har heit.
We both win.	Wy winne beide.
You have to do nothing.	Jo moatte neat dwaan.
If you can not keep it, do not worry.	As jo ​​​​it net hâlde kinne, meitsje jo gjin soargen.
He convinced me to buy a bike.	Hy hat my oertsjûge om in fyts te keapjen.
A man was found.	Der waard in man fûn.
This did not seem right.	Dit like net iens.
I can see them now.	Ik kin se no sjen.
So good for you !!.	Sa goed foar dy!!.
There's a lot too much fun here.	Hjir is in protte te leuk.
So it went.	Sa gie it.
Not my friend.	Net myn freon.
And nice enough.	En moai genôch.
I'm just tired.	Ik bin gewoan wurch.
He did not want to stop, almost not.	Hy woe net ophâlde, hast net.
But all will be well.	Mar alles sil goed komme.
He knows why.	Hy wit wêrom.
We have to do it.	Wy moatte it dwaan.
And got them.	En krige se.
I've never seen one like it.	Ik haw noait sa'n ien sjoen.
There were more, many more.	Der wiene mear, folle mear.
I would say nothing.	Ik soe neat sizze.
It was good that they both loved her.	It wie goed dat se beide fan har hâlde.
Now and then.	Út en troch.
I think we did a really good job.	Ik tocht dat wy echt goed wurk dien hawwe.
We come as often as necessary to get it done.	Wy komme sa faak as nedich om it dien te krijen.
It's for you.	It is foar dy.
The car looked good.	De auto seach der goed út.
Nothing else to say.	Neat oars te sizzen.
There we will live, she decided for us.	Dêr sille wy wenje, hat se foar ús besletten.
Was also not so happy to see me.	Wie my ek net sa bliid om te sjen.
This raises the issue of what would work better.	Dit makket it probleem op wat better soe wurkje.
Even if it's the problem.	Sels as it probleem is.
I have tried this and it has worked a few times.	Ik haw dit besocht en it hat in pear kear wurke.
That had to be good.	Dat moast goed.
He clearly knows me too well.	Hy ken my dúdlik te goed.
Or keep them.	Of hâld se.
But you can never be too sure.	Mar jo kinne noait te wis wêze.
I did not get it yet.	Ik krige it noch net.
You can have something if you want something.	Jo kinne wat hawwe as jo wat wolle.
I would love to help you.	Ik soe graach helpe jo.
Let me get it.	Lit my it krije.
It may not even know, actually.	It kin sels net witte, eins.
I think you love your husband.	Ik tink dat jo fan jo man hâlde.
It's one book.	It is ien boek.
When we got it home again this time.	Doe't wy it dizze kear wer thús krigen.
Also, she said nothing about seeing me again.	Ek sei se neat oer my wer sjen.
It does not leave me yet.	It lit my noch net.
there are	Der binne
She could no longer see.	Se koe net mear sjen.
To tell you.	Dy te fertellen.
She didn't really need it.	Se hie it net echt nedich.
He did not like me.	Hy mocht my net.
For me, it was no different.	Foar my wie it net oars.
It was the only way in.	It wie de ienige manier yn.
Her father knew it, but he was gone.	Har heit koe it witte, mar hy wie fuort.
He wanted nothing.	Hy woe neat.
She had made it.	Se hie it makke.
She says she's a friend.	Se seit dat se in freon is.
If you do, you are not.	As jo ​​dogge, do bist net.
And this is really something to say.	En dit is echt wat te sizzen.
I wonder if this book would work for me.	Ik freegje my ôf oft dit boek foar my soe wurkje.
It would definitely make my day.	It soe wis meitsje myn dei.
But of course we knew it was coming.	Mar wy wisten fansels dat it kaam.
She did not do that.	Dat hat se net dien.
Well, not really.	No, eins net.
Water is necessary for life.	Wetter is nedich foar it libben.
I have to help.	Ik moat helpe.
No one will come to you.	Nimmen sil by jo komme.
But neither does life.	Mar it libben ek net.
I thought about that.	Dêr tocht ik oer.
Evening at dinner.	Jûn by it iten.
They'll tell you.	Se sille it dy fertelle.
Here in.	Hjir yn.
Not about those things.	Net oer dy dingen.
I'll be long, long out.	Ik sil lang, lang út wêze.
It made her want to be a bad person.	It makke har wol in min persoan wêze.
Take a good look at him.	Sjoch goed nei him.
This is a very old house.	Dit is in hiel âld hûs.
It will not be enough.	It sil net genôch wêze.
Just the first couple.	Krekt de earste pear.
But that was them in my mind.	Mar dat wiene se yn myn gedachten.
I'm been away from this evening for a few days.	Ik bin fan dizze jûn in pear dagen fuort.
Can't tell you now.	Kin it dy no net sizze.
All in good time.	Alles op goede tiid.
I just eat the first of them out of hand.	Ik yt de earste fan har gewoan út 'e hân.
They probably keep their word.	Se hâlde wierskynlik har wurd.
Everyone has problems.	Elkenien hat problemen.
I'm still the same guy.	Ik bin noch altyd deselde keardel.
To your children? 	Nei dyn bern?
He worked almost every day of the year.	Hy wurke hast alle dagen fan it jier.
for something else! 	foar wat oars!
She could not find them.	Se koe se net fine.
Hardly anyone saw it.	Hast gjinien seach it.
That's what happened here.	Dat is hjir bard.
He once looked at the car and handed it over.	Hy seach ien kear nei de auto en joech him oer.
I can go there.	Ik kin der hinne.
Which is what never becomes clear.	Wat is wat nea dúdlik wurdt.
I know it scared me.	Ik wit dat it my bang makke.
I want to be sure.	Ik wol der wis fan wêze.
Here's the thing.	Hjir is it ding.
She wished she could talk to her mother.	Se woe dat se mei har mem prate koe.
I really would not.	Ik soe echt net.
He just can not seem to.	Hy kin gewoan net lykje.
You are not waiting for me.	Jo wachtsje net op my.
En.	En .
Well, he did not come in, exactly.	No, hy kaam net yn, krekt.
That makes it busy.	Dat makket it drok.
But this was different.	Mar dit wie oars.
So does his mother.	Ek syn mem docht.
Do you live in this city or something.	Wenje jo yn dizze stêd of wat.
It was not him.	It wie net hy.
Probably something good and something bad.	Wierskynlik wat goed en wat min.
I've never seen him before.	Ik haw him noch noait earder sjoen.
Nothing and everything.	Neat en alles.
It did not do much good.	It die net folle goed.
Let everyone know their name.	Lit elkenien har namme witte.
You were there, and so were you.	Jo wiene der, en dat wiene jo ek.
I do not even know her.	Ik wit har net iens.
Neither wanted it.	Gjin fan beide woe it.
Then she looked up at him.	Dan seach se nei him op.
This is a new day.	Dit is in nije dei.
We'll all go.	Wy sille allegear gean.
My net.	Myn net.
Maybe it was something else.	Miskien wie it wat oars.
It is what we need more than anything.	It is wat wy mear nedich binne as alles.
That's when they do.	Dat is as se dogge.
He knows the way.	Hy wit de wei.
I'm not really sure.	Ik bin der net wis fan echt.
You can try it.	Jo kinne it besykje.
I'm sure he has it.	Ik bin der wis fan dat hy it hat.
He has never been seen or heard from since.	Hy is sûnt nea sjoen of heard.
I'm not even scared.	Ik bin net iens bang.
Or there once was.	Of der wie eartiids.
And it was time.	En it waard tiid.
Come on.	Kom no mei.
We have all day.	Wy hawwe de hiele dei.
The first she ever saw him take.	De earste dy't se him oait nimme seach.
I love the water.	Ik hâld fan it wetter.
He found it difficult to eat.	Hy fûn it dreech om te iten.
He was always a guy with a plan.	Hy wie altyd in keardel mei in plan.
But one thing was certain.	Mar ien ding wie wis.
But if it was easy then everyone would do it.	Mar as it dan maklik wie, soe elkenien it dwaan.
Well, you still have a little time.	No, jo hawwe noch in bytsje tiid.
There were many other problems.	D'r wiene in protte oare problemen.
We can do better.	Wy kinne better.
I already feel better.	Ik fiel my al better.
He came away with a bit of a look for it.	Hy kaam fuort mei in bytsje te sjen foar it.
I'm going back inside the house.	Ik gean werom yn 'e hûs.
I want to go to her.	Ik wol nei har ta.
I wanted to talk to you.	Ik woe mei dy prate.
She told him everything.	Se fertelde him alles.
You know what they are.	Jo witte wat se binne.
Very happy to see you.	Hiel bliid dy te sjen.
One two three.	Ien Twa Trije.
Maybe then we can do something.	Miskien kinne wy ​​dan wat dwaan.
Sure, it will take some hard work.	Wis, it sil wat hurd wurk nimme.
Now there are none.	No binne der gjinien.
You just can not.	Jo kinne gewoan net.
It's one of those things.	It is ien fan dy dingen.
They would talk to you about it.	Se soene der mei dy oer prate.
you must	Do moast
It was him or us.	It wie hy of wy.
I need to work on that more.	Dêr moat ik mear oan wurkje.
I have not had it yet.	Ik haw it noch net hân.
Lots of those over.	In protte fan dy oer.
Living with her father.	Wenje by har heit.
Maybe she did not know that either.	Miskien wist se dat ek net.
He was very late to the meeting.	Hy wie tige let nei de gearkomste.
This has not been done so far.	Dit is oant no ta net dien.
I have to be first.	Ik moat earst wêze.
It's a big question.	It is in grutte fraach.
But it did not really happen.	Mar it barde net echt.
New ones always come up.	Nije komme altyd op.
I knew how hard he had tried.	Ik wist hoe hurd hy besocht hie.
Better another in.	Better in oare yn.
It's past time for many things.	It is ferline tiid foar in protte dingen.
This is just wrong.	Dit is gewoan ferkeard.
He's not too happy, but there's nothing to worry about.	Hy is net al te bliid, mar der is neat oan te gean.
I also did not eat anything.	Ik ha ek neat iten.
I also do not know if I am doing it right.	Ik wit ek net oft ik it goed doch.
He could not speak against me.	Hy koe net tsjin my prate.
He was not ready to talk about his family.	Hy wie net ree om oer syn famylje te praten.
And so for so so beautiful.	En sa foar sa sa moai.
I would not wish anyone these problems.	Ik soe gjinien dizze problemen winskje.
Now you can get everything.	No kinne jo alles krije.
I wish he was here.	Ik winskje dat er hjir wie.
There you want to be.	Dêr wolle jo wêze.
She was not well.	Se wie net goed.
We are one big family.	Wy binne ien grutte famylje.
She knew her father was waiting for her.	Se wist dat har heit op har wachte.
It's just what they need to do.	It is gewoan wat se moatte dwaan.
I think a lot of people can.	Ik tink dat in protte minsken kinne.
I had to go for it.	Ik moast der foar gean.
It was like nothing she had ever heard.	It wie as neat se hie ea heard.
I did not want to do any of those things.	Ik woe net ien fan dy dingen dwaan.
You can take the car.	Jo kinne nimme de auto.
Do not tell my husband!	Fertel myn man net!
Do they know what you're talking about?	Witte se wêr't jo it oer hawwe?
It did almost a few years ago.	It die hast in pear jier lyn.
I was very wrong.	Ik wie tige ferkeard.
I was the only one who could help me.	Ik wie de iennichste dy't my helpe koe.
Everyone was busy.	Elkenien wie drok.
She added the word.	Se joech it wurd oan.
With the children.	Mei de bern.
He looked at the water.	Hy seach nei it wetter.
I assume he's coming to talk to me.	Ik nim oan dat er komt om mei my te praten.
There is truth in this.	D'r is wierheid yn dit.
He wanted to be told what to do.	Hy woe sein wurde wat er dwaan moast.
It seemed good to me.	It like my goed.
It just does not look good.	It sjocht der gewoan net goed út.
We should have had a chance to get away.	Wy soene in kâns hân hawwe om fuort te kommen.
That was not entirely true, but it would have been enough.	Dat wie net hielendal wier, mar it soe genôch west hawwe.
They need help.	Dy moatte helpe.
I think you really have something here.	Ik tink dat jo hjir echt wat hawwe.
He put himself in though.	Hy sette him wol yn.
They will probably do it.	Se sille it wierskynlik dwaan.
I just had to ask.	Ik moast mar freegje.
I know everything about her.	Ik wit alles oer har.
He just thought he was.	Hy tocht gewoan dat hy wie.
They are fun for me.	Se binne leuk foar my.
And people are angry about this.	En minsken binne hjir lilk oer.
I saw a picture of her.	Ik haw in foto fan har sjoen.
Now almost a month ago.	No hast in moanne lyn.
We do not have to agree.	Wy hoege net iens te bliuwen.
I would say the same.	Ik soe itselde sizze.
We'm going on.	Wy geane troch.
I did not know what it was.	Ik wist net wat it wie.
I can see that happening.	Ik kin sjen dat barre.
I had read about what happened here.	Ik hie lêzen oer wat hjir barde.
Go to your room.	Gean nei dyn keamer.
She does not want him to look like that.	Se wol net dat er sa sjocht.
Everything comes with a reason.	Alles komt mei in reden.
Do not accept anything.	Nim neat oan.
Not as if he had to say it.	Net as moast er it sizze.
I really need to work on that.	Dêr moat ik echt oan wurkje.
Now it's something else.	No is it wat oars.
We were not there.	Wy wiene der net.
It just wasn’t mine.	It wie gewoan net fan my.
He is now a young man and working.	Hy is no in jonge man en wurket.
You can do it and you will do it.	Jo kinne it dwaan en jo sille it dwaan.
Maybe she thought of that.	Miskien tocht se dêr oan.
No other words are needed.	Gjin oare wurden binne nedich.
It should be good.	It soe goed wêze moatte.
He was not sure how it happened.	Hy wie net wis hoe't it barde.
Whatever it is.	Wat it ek is.
I do not know where it could have gone.	Ik wit net wêr't it hinne koe.
She wanted to leave, but she could not.	Se woe fuort, mar se koe net.
Please help me with this.	Help my asjebleaft mei dizze.
He had so many questions.	Hy hie safolle fragen.
So she should be.	Sa soe se wêze moatte.
Well, it works a bit.	No, it wurket in bytsje.
But he can not.	Mar hy kin net.
They would help him.	Se soene him helpe.
But they go on.	Mar se geane troch.
I really love my job.	Ik hâld echt fan myn wurk.
They both knew that.	Dat wisten se beide.
At first he could hardly believe his mother.	Earst koe er syn mem hast net leauwe.
This is your last chance to make something of your life.	Dit is jo lêste kâns om wat fan jo libben te meitsjen.
That's really the problem here.	Dat is hjir echt it probleem.
I told my mother that none of it was true.	Ik fertelde myn mem dat neat fan it wier wie.
Not one of us did.	Net ien fan ús die.
But we do not have to be those people.	Mar dy minsken hoege wy net te wêzen.
I know that well.	Dat wit ik wol goed.
And he had friends.	En hy hie freonen.
It can actually work.	It kin eins wurkje.
She knows something's going on.	Se wit dat der wat bart.
They were of some sort.	Se wiene fan in soarte.
Maybe it should.	Miskien soe it moatte.
I've seen this guy before.	Ik haw dizze jonge al earder sjoen.
You would say.	Jo soene sizze.
This was exactly what he wanted.	Dit wie krekt wat er woe.
I can not be found.	Ik kin net fûn wurde.
It hurt like nothing else had.	It die sear as neat oars hie.
Nothing was ever good enough.	Neat wie oait goed genôch.
Neither did her father.	Har heit ek net.
That seemed wrong.	Dat like ferkeard.
I have some money.	Ik haw wat jild.
Let it do its job.	Lit it syn wurk dwaan.
I never wanted children.	Ik woe noait bern.
Such a man was not there.	Sa'n man wie der net.
Only then.	Allinnich dan mar.
Your mother will need her.	Jo mem sil har nedich hawwe.
Do not worry about it.	Meitsje jo der gjin soargen oer.
And remember what you do, your children will do too.	En tink om wat jo dogge, jo bern sille ek dwaan.
I did not even think about what good things really were.	Ik tocht net iens nei wat goede dingen echt wiene.
Do you want to talk to me, you do not come up here.	Wolle jo mei my prate, jo komme hjir net op.
I do not want his money.	Ik wol syn jild net.
I'm here for the baby.	Ik bin hjir foar it bern.
Over time too.	Oer tiid ek.
It was so good to be home, he told us.	It wie sa goed om thús te wêzen, fertelde er ús.
Reason told me not to be afraid.	Reden sei my net bang te wêzen.
To get in here it must have one.	Om hjir yn te kommen moat it ien hawwe.
Please help me to see what the problem is if you can.	Help my asjebleaft om te sjen wat it probleem is as jo kinne.
That's not his way.	Dat is syn manier net.
He's been busy lately.	Hy hat it de lêste tiid drok hân.
That he can not let happen again.	Dat kin er net wer barre litte.
This time was different.	Dizze kear wie oars.
I would like the same thing.	Ik soe graach itselde ding.
You can help me more.	Jo kinne my mear helpe.
Let's make them with it.	Lit ús meitsje se mei it.
Must be long gone.	Moat al lang fuort wêze.
You just get through it.	Jo komme der gewoan troch.
Well, you can just walk away.	No, jo kinne gewoan fuort.
It's something to see.	It is wat te sjen.
He picked up the book.	Hy naam it boek op.
But the problem was, there were people in the way.	Mar it probleem wie, d'r wiene minsken yn 'e wei.
But you do not even seem so happy about it.	Mar jo lykje der net iens sa bliid om.
I know who this is.	Ik wit wa't dit is.
That's a different man altogether.	Dat is in oare man hielendal.
Maybe two or three years.	Miskien twa of trije jier.
He saw nothing.	Hy seach neat.
He accepted it, of course.	Hy naam it fansels oan.
Now we get some truth.	No krije wy wat wierheid.
They could not find one.	Se koene net ien fine.
Nobody knew what.	Nimmen wist wat.
He could say nothing more.	Hy koe neat mear sizze.
That was not us.	Dat wiene wy ​​net.
I wish you would.	Ik winskje dat jo wolle.
That's the whole truth.	Dat is de hiele wierheid.
I worked hard.	Ik wurke hurd.
Maybe it will.	Miskien is it wol.
It looks like those days are back.	It liket derop dat dy dagen werom binne.
Maybe even today.	Miskien sels hjoed.
That was really hard for me.	Dat wie echt dreech foar my.
And so he is.	En sa is hy.
In this room.	Yn dizze keamer.
Believe that and you will believe everything.	Leau dat en jo sille alles leauwe.
I bought my parents a house.	Ik haw myn âlden in hûs kocht.
It was not so before.	It wie earder net sa.
Or had to do.	Of moast dwaan.
He will be there again this year.	Hy sil der dit jier wer hinne.
But that can not.	Mar dat kin net.
He wanted to make it right.	Hy woe dit goed meitsje.
They had been waiting for us.	Se hiene op ús wachte.
But that is not good enough.	Mar dat is net goed genôch.
There is no talking.	Der wurdt net praat.
She should not have us there.	Se soe ús der net hawwe moatte.
Maybe my dad's name is on it.	Miskien stiet de namme fan myn heit der op.
It's hard to see him away.	It is dreech om him fuort te sjen.
I never wanted anyone more.	Ik haw noait immen mear woe.
He did not say it.	Hy sei it net.
So you have to play at your best.	Sa moatte jo spylje op dyn bêste.
I can go myself.	Ik kin sels gean.
All they think is money.	Alles wat se tinke is jild.
I knew me.	Ik koe my.
That was ever.	Dat wie ea.
He was talking about it.	Hy hie it der oer.
People were not their thing.	Minsken wiene har ding net.
For the people who are afraid for their lives.	Foar de minsken dy't bang binne foar har libben.
I see him almost every day.	Ik sjoch him hast alle dagen.
And there you are wrong.	En dêr binne jo ferkeard.
We do not want to take any chances.	Wy wolle gjin kâns nimme.
But she works too hard.	Mar se wurket te hurd.
She needed him.	Se hie him nedich.
But one thing seems likely.	Mar ien ding liket wierskynlik.
I'm so angry.	Ik bin sa lilk.
I want to come up with something different for him.	Ik kom wol wat oars foar him.
This is true.	Dit is wier.
Out in.	Út yn.
I'll never ask you to stay away.	Ik sil dy noait freegje om fuort te bliuwen.
I was too busy.	Ik hie it te drok.
Of course, he would have to be careful.	Fansels soe hy foarsichtich wêze moatte.
I ask for help.	Ik freegje om help.
Of course, they do not go away completely.	Se geane fansels net hielendal fuort.
We could not.	Wy koene it net.
I will probably agree with you.	Ik sil wierskynlik mei jo iens wêze.
Here is the question.	Hjir is de fraach.
This will not be a problem for me.	Dit sil gjin probleem foar my wêze.
You will never find someone who loves everything you like.	Jo sille noait ien fine dy't fan alles hâldt wat jo leuk fine.
And there he met my mother.	En dêr moete er myn mem.
Why don't they just buy for that money ?, they ask.	Wêrom keapje se net gewoan foar dat jild?, freegje se.
I could not see.	Ik koe net sjen.
We love our children.	Wy hâlde fan ús bern.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Oant no ta kin nimmen.
But for some reason, for that man, it did.	Mar om ien of oare reden, foar dy man, die it.
He turned it around.	Hy joech it om.
I would just love to see this guy.	Ik soe gewoan sjen om dizze man te sjen.
She knew she loved her father.	Se wist dat se fan har heit hâlde.
No one came for her.	Gjinien kaam foar har.
She was not surprised.	Se wie net ferrast.
He had done this twice before.	Dat hie er earder al twa kear dien.
And we do.	En wy dogge.
And you know we do.	En jo witte wy.
It goes on.	It giet troch.
You can not tell what they have in mind.	Jo kinne net fertelle wat se yn gedachten hawwe.
We do not need any money this month.	Wy hawwe dizze moanne gjin jild nedich.
I wonder which.	Ik freegje my ôf hokker.
My husband could not be with me.	Myn man koe net by my wêze.
If you have anything to say to me, come to me yourself.	As jo ​​my wat te sizzen hawwe, kom dan sels by my.
No one.	Gjin ien.
This is where you can help us.	Dit is wêr't jo ús kinne helpe.
He felt he was under family again.	Hy fielde dat er wer ûnder famylje wie.
It must remain open.	It moat iepen bliuwe.
It was not difficult to find someone.	It wie net dreech om immen te finen.
But she would like one.	Mar se soe graach ien.
I will try to find out.	Ik sil besykje út te finen.
I never, ever thought you would.	Ik nea, nea tocht datsto soe.
I want to do all the things that people do.	Ik wol alle dingen dwaan dy't minsken dogge.
Mom is with us.	Mem is by ús.
I know you believe me.	Ik wit dat jo my leauwe.
There you are needed.	Dêr binne jo nedich.
It did not matter where you were from.	It makke net út wêr't jo wei wiene.
He never knew exactly why.	Hy wist noait krekt wêrom.
I thought it had been her.	Ik tocht dat it har west hie.
He would do anything for me.	Hy soe alles foar my dwaan.
Everyone wants that.	Elkenien wol dat.
We would like to have some of that.	Wy wolle der graach wat fan hawwe.
Show it to our friends.	Lit it oan ús freonen sjen.
He said he wanted me to do a party for him.	Hy sei dat hy woe dat ik in feest foar him dwaan soe.
When he saw you there.	Doe't er dy seach dêr.
These were needed.	Dy wiene nedich.
I did not think she would actually go.	Ik tocht net dat se eins gean soe.
We do everything together.	Wy dogge alles tegearre.
I'm sure there's nothing.	Ik bin der wis fan dat der neat is.
Then move on with your life.	Gean dan troch mei dyn libben.
And so we finish it.	En sa meitsje wy it ôf.
It did not matter.	It hoegde net.
I needed water.	Ik hie wetter nedich.
We would get in trouble if they did not.	Wy soene yn de problemen komme as se dat net diene.
It looks pretty good.	It sjocht der aardich goed út.
She told her she was scared.	Se fertelde har dat se bang wie.
He was much more than that.	Hy wie folle mear as dat.
Neither of us should let that happen.	Net ien fan ús moat dat barre litte.
The first good.	De earste goede.
I'm in my office.	Ik bin yn myn kantoar.
The question is what to do about it.	De fraach is wat der oan te dwaan.
It could not be there.	It koe der net wêze.
And you do not get much of it.	En jo krije der net folle fan.
As long as she wants.	Sa lang as se wol.
I wish I wanted to.	Ik woe dat ik wol.
Let me tell you about him.	Lit my dy oer him fertelle.
Here is mine.	Hjir is myn.
He is here with us.	Hy is hjir by ús.
There will be enough work for them to do.	Der sil genôch wurk wêze foar har te dwaan.
It is done.	It wurdt dien.
I would never wish that on anyone.	Dat soe ik noait ien winskje.
He would wait, of course.	Hy soe wachtsje, fansels.
I asked for help.	Ik frege om help.
She can do nothing.	Se kin neat dwaan.
It did not happen in a day and it was not easy.	It barde net yn in dei en it wie net maklik.
Which animal do you like best?	Hokker bist liket jo it bêste?
For real for real for real.	Foar echt foar echt foar echt.
It was too hard to tell.	It wie te dreech om te fertellen.
But it actually happened.	Mar it barde eins.
You will pay for this.	Jo sille betelje foar dit.
Next, let other people try it.	Folgjende, lit oare minsken besykje it.
Help us help you !.	Help ús jo te helpen!.
I really need to talk to him.	Ik moat echt mei him prate.
You would buy, buy, buy.	Jo soene keapje, keapje, keapje.
She wanted to wait.	Se woe wachtsje.
But we have enough time together.	Mar wy hawwe genôch tiid tegearre.
He sat in there for a long time.	Hy siet der lang yn.
Let's talk about food.	Lit ús prate oer it iten.
They still make me happy.	Se meitsje my noch altyd bliid.
Well, to the problems themselves.	No, nei de problemen sels.
She knows that.	Dat wit se.
Look at him!	Sjoch nei him!
We will see more about that tomorrow.	Dêr sille wy moarn mear oer sjen.
So could you.	Sa koene jo.
It was as if nothing had happened.	It wie as wie der neat bard.
It felt.	It fielde.
She was not a teacher, but a teacher.	Se wie gjin learaar, mar in learaar.
Let it go.	Lit dy mar litte.
Nobody asked him anything.	Nimmen frege him wat.
Now she has to work and take care of her children.	No moat se wurkje en foar har bern soargje.
Well, you get the idea.	No, jo krije it idee.
We've heard of that.	Dêr ha wy fan heard.
Something very different.	Wat hiel oars.
I was fine though.	Ik wie wol goed.
Clearly they do.	Dúdlik dogge se.
I need more hours in the day.	Ik moat mear oeren yn 'e dei.
This will be fun.	Dit sil leuk wêze.
It's so much more than that.	It is safolle mear as dat.
It did not see how it could be her.	It seach net hoe't it har wêze koe.
She looked so old.	Se seach der sa âld út.
They will or they will not.	Se sille of se sille net.
I'm sure someone will get it.	Ik bin der wis fan dat immen it sil krije.
I'll be back then.	Ik kom dan werom.
She always knew what to say.	Se wist altyd wat te sizzen.
It's not that they're bad.	It is net dat se min binne.
I'm that person.	Ik bin dy persoan.
If not today, tomorrow, soon.	As net hjoed, moarn, gau.
Everyone knows everyone.	Elkenien ken elkenien.
We're just talking about them.	Wy prate gewoan oer har.
I think both are true.	Ik tink dat beide wier binne.
And no one did anything about it.	En nimmen die der wat oan.
But a few are interested.	Mar in pear binne ynteressearre.
Well, he has come to the right person.	No, hy is by de goede persoan kommen.
That's what actually happened.	Dat is wat der eins bard is.
Things are no longer like that.	Dingen binne net mear sa.
Pass it on.	Jou it troch.
Make time for it.	Meitsje der tiid foar.
We can not have one without you.	Wy kinne gjin ien hawwe sûnder dy.
This really scared me.	Dit makke my echt bang.
Try this book.	Besykje dit boek.
I just looked at him.	Ik seach him mar oan.
We think it works well.	Wy tinke dat it goed wurket.
Back from him.	Werom fan him ôf.
It is there of course.	It is der fansels.
We still have it.	Wy hawwe it noch.
She just had no idea where.	Se hie gewoan gjin idee wêr't.
I had to get over this thing.	Ik moast oer dit ding komme.
Of course, people can get it wrong.	Fansels kinne minsken it ferkeard krije.
You can stay.	Jo kinne bliuwe.
You'll get there soon.	Jo komme der gau op.
He did not have much to worry about.	Hy hie net folle te soargen oer.
So far nothing.	Oant no ta neat.
They have never met in person.	Se hawwe nea moete yn persoan.
And we are here to stay.	En wy binne hjir om te bliuwen.
And so it began.	En sa begûn it.
He does it every day.	Hy docht it alle dagen.
You can not be found.	Jo kinne net fûn wurde.
She was open and gave, and he took.	Se wie iepen en joech, en hy naam.
You just knew it.	Jo wisten it gewoan.
He will, of course.	Hy sil fansels.
Now let's see what I have.	Lit no sjen wat ik haw.
He said he could not help it.	Hy sei dat er him net helpe koe.
Everything was so different than there.	Alles wie sa oars as dêr.
I was not tired either.	Ik wie ek net wurch.
And it did not hurt her either.	En it makke har ek net ferkeard.
He did not want to leave.	Hy woe net fuort.
She took the place for me.	Se naam it plak foar my yn.
We make it do.	Wy meitsje it dwaan.
It was not just today.	It wie net allinnich hjoed.
Maybe even a year.	Miskien sels in jier.
I wondered if he was one.	Ik frege my ôf oft hy ien wie.
But it would be good for me to go.	Mar it soe goed wêze foar my om te gean.
Maybe she would come tomorrow.	Miskien soe se moarn komme.
There should be some driving tomorrow.	Der soe moarn wat riden wurde moatte.
That must be it.	Dat moat it wêze.
She found none.	Se fûn gjinien.
That stops.	Dy hâldt op.
Well, you can always try.	No, jo kinne altyd besykje.
It's time to stop.	It is tiid om op te hâlden.
Nothing really happened.	Der is eins neat bard.
Needless to say.	Mear hoegde net te sizzen.
I did not ask her why.	Ik haw har net frege wêrom.
Then they come back for me.	Dan komme se foar my werom.
She should know better.	Se soe better witte moatte.
Nothing was done.	Der waard neat dien.
I said that.	Ik sei dat.
There were not enough people.	Der wiene net genôch minsken.
Somehow it came in handy.	Op ien of oare manier kaam it yn.
That was a very good idea.	Dat wie in hiel goed idee.
I would live with him and his wife.	Ik soe wenje mei him en syn frou.
And it can happen now.	En it kin no barre.
He liked to watch.	Hy like om te sjen.
And this should be easy.	En dit moat maklik wêze.
I want to know who did it.	Ik wol witte wa't it dien hat.
You do not have to leave early.	Jo moatte net betiid fuort.
And now, suffice it to say, you're tired.	En no, genôch sein, bist wurch.
But that was never done.	Mar dat is nea dien.
There is, of course, much more.	Der is fansels noch folle mear.
Fun is fun.	Leuk is leuk.
There is a house	Der is in hûs
I was like.	Ik wie like.
I see it now, just like day.	Ik sjoch it no, gewoan as dei.
He knew her father better than anyone.	Hy koe har heit better as elkenien.
So it was.	Sa wie it.
Long past time.	Lang ferline tiid.
They love their children.	Se hâlde fan har bern.
Please leave your dog at home.	Lit jo hûn asjebleaft thús.
He did not know if she felt it.	Hy wist net oft se it fielde.
Once a week she visits him in prison.	Ien kear yn 'e wike besocht se him yn' e finzenis.
I know you never got it.	Ik wit dat jo it noait krigen hawwe.
He knows what you need.	Hy wit wat jo nedich binne.
They had nothing to go on.	Se hiene neat te gean.
I have no idea what the problem might be.	Ik haw gjin idee wat it probleem wêze kin.
I love her a lot.	Ik hâld fan har in protte.
I do not know him well.	Ik ken him net goed.
That had to go.	Dat moast gean.
There may be a little time left over.	Der kin in bytsje tiid oer hawwe.
To not get.	Om net te krijen.
Do not work too hard.	Wurkje net te hurd.
Mine was even better.	Myn wie noch better.
I love her back.	Ik hâld fan har werom.
It was her again.	It wie har wer.
But we can not have that.	Mar dat kinne wy ​​net hawwe.
You can visit him sooner if you want.	Jo kinne him earder besykje as jo wolle.
I was just looking at it.	Ik seach der mar nei.
But she had friends.	Mar se hie freonen.
It can be both.	It kin beide wêze.
She could do it.	Se koe it dwaan.
Dad knew this.	Heit wist dit.
Tell me what you want me to be.	Fertel my wat jo wolle dat ik bin.
He could still see her.	Hy koe har noch sjen.
Without her parents.	Sûnder har âlden.
He does nothing to help.	Hy docht neat om te helpen.
Please come back.	Kom asjebleaft werom.
Not a bit of it.	Net in bytsje fan it.
You need to know what that is.	Jo moatte witte wat dat is.
But it does not work for me.	Mar it wurket net foar my.
So he took his dog with him.	Dat hy naam syn hûn mei.
I'll know if you tell him.	Ik sil it witte as jo it him fertelle.
Everyone was fine.	Elkenien wie goed.
She became angry.	Se waard lilk.
Please hold him.	Hâld him asjebleaft.
Give it up and be better.	Jou it op en wês better.
Work something out.	Wurkje wat út.
Of better words.	Fan better wurden.
So it could be with a man.	Sa koe it mei in man wêze.
I'm coming to him.	Ik kom by him.
They did it for me.	Se diene it foar my.
That's exactly what I'll do.	Dat sil ik krekt dwaan.
And even then, it may not be enough.	En sels dan kin it net genôch wêze.
I just love it all about it.	Ik hâld der gewoan fan alles oer.
They want to be happy.	Se wolle bliid wêze.
It's easy not to find things if you try hard enough.	It is maklik om dingen net te finen, as jo hurd genôch besykje.
I am very good at my job.	Ik bin hiel goed yn myn wurk.
I'm very happy.	Ik bin tige bliid.
This is what needs to happen.	Dit is wat der barre moat.
He should not have come, he thinks.	Hy hie net komme moatten, tinkt er.
But many do not.	Mar in protte net.
I had never thought of that before.	Ik hie der noch noait oan tocht.
Get out of here now.	Kom no fuort.
He would still try.	Hy soe noch besykje.
I could not go back on that.	Dêr koe ik net op werom.
Wait, now it's time for us to go.	Wachtsje, no is it tiid foar ús om te gean.
Let me tell you my way.	Lit my it op myn manier fertelle.
And that was that.	En dat wie dat.
This home is everything we ever want or need.	Dit hûs is alles wat wy oait wolle of nedich binne.
I take a day off about once a month.	Ik nim in dei frij oer ien kear yn 'e moanne.
She had had enough of that.	Dêr hie se genôch fan.
He's just fine.	Hy die net alles goed.
That's when we'm ready on time.	Dat is as wy op 'e tiid klear binne.
I felt something that was just about the right size.	Ik fielde wat dat krekt oer de goede grutte wie.
And there's nothing you can do about it.	En d'r is neat dat jo der oan kinne dwaan.
Not without seeing my family again.	Net sûnder myn famylje wer te sjen.
Not for nothing.	Net foar neat.
I get angry too.	Ik wurd ek lilk.
If you want to do that, fine.	As jo ​​dat dwaan wolle, goed.
She had the time to do it.	Se hie de tiid om it te dwaan.
Everyone wanted to talk for the last time.	Elkenien woe foar de lêste kear prate.
Earlier this week.	Earder dizze wike.
He does not look happy.	Hy sjocht der net bliid út.
She was alone in the house with him.	Se wie allinnich yn 'e hûs mei him.
It seems like everything is working out well.	It liket te wêzen dat alles goed wurket.
It was there before.	It wie der earder.
One, if you did something wrong.	Ien, as jo wat ferkeard dien hawwe.
I know that better than he can.	Ik kin dat better as hy kin.
He took a chance.	Hy naam in kâns.
She had to talk to him.	Se moast tsjin him prate.
She went back.	Gie se werom.
But even this has problems.	Mar ek dit hat problemen.
They needed a new teacher.	Se hiene in nije learaar nedich.
You're just wrong.	Jo binne gewoan ferkeard.
She walked away.	Se rûn fuort.
She can hardly wait.	Se kin hast net wachtsje.
We get ready for you.	Wy meitsje ús klear foar jo.
His mother.	Syn mem .
You need to do this early in the day.	Jo moatte dit betiid op 'e dei dwaan.
I would not even tell her about it.	Ik soe har der net iens oer fertelle.
You did not eat.	Do hast net iten.
I went through it.	Ik gie der troch.
They will tell you everything.	Se sille jo alles fertelle.
He looked at it.	Hy seach der nei.
She looked at him cautiously.	Se seach him foarsichtich yn.
Never saw me once given.	Nea sjoen my ien kear jûn.
But he still looked like a child.	Mar hy like noch as in bern.
We hope for the best.	Wy hoopje op it bêste.
I'm not sure any of that is true.	Ik bin der net wis fan dat ien fan dat wier is.
She was even nice to me.	Se wie sels aardich foar my.
Come with me.	Kom mei.
I wish her well.	Ik winskje har goed.
People do things.	Minsken dogge dingen.
But the big questions are these.	Mar de grutte fragen binne dizze.
We want them back with us.	Wy wolle se werom by ús.
He arrived late today.	Hy kaam hjoed let oan.
Otherwise you have a lot of work to do.	Oars ha jo in protte wurk.
Let them stay home.	Lit se thús bliuwe.
She was not happy or not happy.	Se wie net bliid of net bliid.
Things were different here.	Dingen wiene hjir oars.
They go on without ever seeing me as a person.	Se geane troch sûnder my oait as persoan te sjen.
I could never go without food.	Ik koe nea gean sûnder iten.
It was the man with him who died.	It wie de man by him dy't stoar.
That's good enough for me.	Dat is goed genôch foar my.
That will tell you if you will be okay.	Dat sil jo fertelle as jo goed sille wêze.
Going to.	Gean nei.
Even that was not allowed.	Ek dat mocht net.
And it did.	En it die.
I'm on my way now.	Ik bin no op 'e wei wei.
I told him there would be no more.	Ik sei tsjin him dat der net mear wêze soe.
It's not like he's actually given anything.	It is net sa dat er eins wat jûn hat.
Not the first time.	Net de earste kear.
I'm glad he found you.	Ik bin bliid dat er dy fûn.
Now the problem is this.	No is it probleem dit.
They love their work.	Se hâlde fan har wurk.
There was no time to finish the work.	Der wie gjin tiid om it wurk ôf te meitsjen.
I'm fine, really.	Ik bin goed, echt.
How much you love them.	Hoe folle jo fan har hâlde.
Maybe they will give you more.	Miskien sille se jo mear jaan.
Come on, come on.	Kom, kom mei.
Well, almost none.	No, hast gjinien.
But that just wasn’t the money for it.	Mar dêr wie gewoan net it jild foar.
You take what you can get.	Jo nimme wat jo kinne krije.
You should not have come here.	Do hiest hjir net komme moatten.
I do not want to hurt anyone.	Ik wol gjinien sear dwaan.
Probably you are.	Wierskynlik bist.
A place to stay.	In plak om te bliuwen.
This book made me both very clear.	Dit boek makke my beide tige dúdlik.
Sit with me and talk.	Sit by my en praat.
Please help us.	Help ús asjebleaft.
I really, really hope so.	Ik hoopje it echt, echt.
I had to go there.	Ik moast der hinne.
And then everyone will want to see it.	En dan sil elkenien it wol sjen.
We never heard from him again.	Wy hawwe nea wer fan him heard.
The police let the friend go.	De plysje liet de freon gean.
But that was really good for me.	Mar dat wie echt goed foar my.
You can always talk to me.	Jo kinne altyd mei my prate.
You'll have something tomorrow.	Jo sille moarn wat hawwe.
As if here was a place for me.	As wie hjir in plak foar my.
Maybe they did not.	Miskien hiene se it net.
He did not know what to say to her.	Hy wist net wat er tsjin har sizze moast.
You've had enough to eat.	Do hast genôch te iten hân.
I think he will play again.	Ik tink dat hy sil spylje wer.
He was a guy who made you worry.	Hy wie in keardel dy't jo soargen makke.
This is tired.	Dit is wurch.
You want to have things as beautiful as you can have them.	Jo wolle dingen sa moai hawwe as jo se hawwe kinne.
That has been the case in the past.	Dat is yn it ferline sa west.
Her father had lived here as a child.	Har heit hie hjir as bern wenne.
Who will tell her?	Wa sil it har fertelle?
I was an old guy.	Ik wie in âld keardel.
Well, we did it.	No, wy hawwe it dien.
More, more of me.	Mear, mear fan my.
And here it was, happening again.	En hjir wie it, bart wer.
He has come to you here every day.	Hy is hjir alle dagen nei dy kommen.
People need to do that.	Minsken moatte dat dwaan.
He has no friends.	Hy hat gjin freonen.
I feel like a child.	Ik fiel my as in bern.
He did not know why he had done this himself.	Hy wist net wêrom't er dit sels dien hie.
And look there.	En sjoch dêr.
We had nothing to do with it.	Wy hiene der neat mei te krijen.
But it was the best she could do.	Mar it wie it bêste dat se dwaan koe.
They never do, but you never know.	Se nea dwaan, mar jo nea witte.
Nothing about my life seemed real.	Neat oer myn libben like echt.
Not sure on that either.	Net wis op dat ek.
Then go away.	Gean dan fuort.
But she was so different from my mother.	Mar se wie sa oars as myn mem.
I've not seen you lately.	Ik haw dy de lêste tiid net sjoen.
I'm sure many of these are pretty good.	Ik bin der wis fan dat in protte fan dizze binne frij goed.
They just would not talk about it.	Se soene der gewoan net oer prate.
Really, really, she did not know what to say to him.	Echt, echt wist se net wat se tsjin him sizze moast.
Of many things.	Fan in protte dingen.
She told him she had something to tell him.	Se fertelde him dat se him wat te fertellen hie.
He had no more talk in him today.	Hy hie hjoed gjin praat mear yn him.
I really know nothing about it.	Ik wit der eins neat fan.
I give it to you after this.	Ik jou it dy nei dit.
He was wrong, not me.	Hy hie it ferkeard, net ik.
I have not bought it yet.	Ik haw it noch net kocht.
It should just be fun.	It moat gewoan leuk wêze.
Be carefull.	Wês foarsichtich.
But we're just good friends.	Mar wy binne gewoan goede freonen.
I do not feel it is mine.	Ik fiel net dat it fan my is.
Also that she was nice.	Ek dat se aardich wie.
Or so it seems.	Of sa liket it.
That's if you want them.	Dat is as jo har wolle.
You take to your father.	Jo nimme nei jo heit.
Nice to talk to you.	Leuk mei dy te praten.
They only have each other, whether they want to or not.	Se hawwe allinnich elkoar, oft se wolle of net.
She needs more than that in her life.	Se hat mear nedich as dat yn har libben.
She never met herself.	Se moete har sels noait.
What a person.	Wat foar persoan.
She tried to open it.	Se besocht it iepen te meitsjen.
Well, it just seems to stay there.	No, it liket der gewoan te bliuwen.
She knew exactly where they were going.	Se wist krekt wêr't se hinne wiene.
But there is none.	Mar der is gjinien.
She started going back from there.	Se begûn der fan werom te gean.
He did not look at her.	Hy seach har net oan.
I did not go back to my parents.	Ik gie net werom nei myn âlden.
And it was good too.	En it wie ek goed.
I was surprised he had not asked for it.	Ik wie ferrast dat er der net nei frege hie.
He did not want to tell his parents.	Hy woe it syn âlden net fertelle.
This is what she does.	Dit is wat se docht.
I can find it again.	Ik kin it wer fine.
I think they found me.	Ik tink dat se my fûn hawwe.
No one else had ever visited him.	Nimmen oars hie him ea besocht.
Nothing is going well tonight.	Der giet fannacht neat goed.
She did not know what to make of it.	Se wist net wat se der fan meitsje moast.
And actually it's really nice.	En eins is it echt moai.
And she looks good.	En se sjocht wol.
This was what she did to him, she thought.	Dit wie wat se mei him die, tocht oan har.
But, this was not enough.	Mar, dit wie net genôch.
Man.	Man.
In his first week.	Yn syn earste wike.
I hope you win tonight.	Ik hoopje dat jo fannacht winne.
I heard about that.	Dêr hearde ik fan.
We have absolutely no idea where he was that day.	Wy hawwe hielendal gjin idee wêr't hy wie dy dei.
Go away now.	Gean no fuort.
The man who came to him at that other place.	De man dy't op dat oare plak by him kaam.
You can take time off once a day.	Jo kinne ien kear in dei frij nimme.
Plan your day carefully so as not to be late.	Plan jo dei foarsichtich om net te let te wêzen.
Exactly the same.	Krekt itselde.
It's very free.	It is hiel frij.
He could actually see nothing.	Hy koe eins neat sjen.
We are not happy to see them.	Wy binne net bliid om se te sjen.
Think nothing of it.	Tink der neat fan.
I wanted to tell you something.	Ik woe dy wat fertelle.
Now you can see me wherever you are.	No kinne jo my sjen, wêr't jo ek binne.
He said he wants to go back.	Hy sei dat er werom wol.
I'm afraid that place.	Ik bin bang dat plak.
It's too early.	It is te betiid.
I have a lot of these.	Ik haw in protte fan dizze.
It was not about money.	It gie net oer jild.
She does it very well.	Se docht it hiel goed.
I know it is not.	Ik wit dat it net is.
She made the party ready.	Se makke it feest klear.
One after the other.	Ien nei de oare.
But what he knew now was enough.	Mar wat er no wist wie genôch.
Now things would be different.	No soene dingen oars wêze.
There is no one else there.	Dêr is gjinien oars.
What he said was obviously not true.	Wat er sei wie fansels net wier.
I thought she would be back.	Ik tocht dat se werom soe.
You just have to be ready for anything.	Jo moatte gewoan klear wêze foar alles.
It does not matter to me what they think of me.	It makket my neat út wat se oer my tinke.
It will be good for you.	It sil goed wêze foar jo.
But that was not good.	Mar dat wie net goed.
This had been tried before.	Dit wie earder besocht.
But you would not know it.	Mar jo soene it net witte.
I have two of them.	Ik haw der twa fan.
I made the words.	Ik makke de wurden.
Of course he can.	Fansels kin er.
Nothing like this.	Neat oars as dit.
And there he sat.	En dêr siet er.
I was very worried and needed help.	Ik waard heul soargen en hie help nedich.
There will of course be more.	Der komt fansels mear.
There is a lot to do.	Der is in protte te dwaan.
That's what we saw.	Dat hawwe wy sjoen.
He is in you.	Hy is yn dy.
Maybe you did.	Miskien hawwe jo dien.
You can not help everyone.	Jo kinne net elkenien helpe.
It needs more of that.	Dêr hat it mear fan nedich.
But three months old.	Mar trije moanne âld.
What is the time?	Wat is de tiid?
He spent days trying to find his way home.	Hy besocht dagen om syn wei nei hûs te finen.
We have food.	Wy hawwe iten.
She did not like to know now.	Se mocht no net graach witte.
There is enough time.	Der is genôch tiid.
I had nothing to do with it.	Ik hie der neat om.
I love a lot of things.	Ik hâld fan in protte dingen.
This is her place, not mine.	Dit is har plak, net myn.
The only questions are when and how.	De ienige fragen binne wannear en hoe.
As you wish.	Sa as jo winskje.
About the same as at home.	Oer itselde as thús.
Much better to deal with this problem yourself.	Folle better om te gean mei dit probleem sels.
He's a fan.	Hy is in fan.
Here was a man.	Hjir wie in man.
He did not seem to like it.	Hy like der net út dat er it moai fûn.
But that's just what I'm talking about.	Mar dat is gewoan ik praat.
And that's not her.	En dat is se net.
But it was easy.	Mar it wie maklik.
But there was a problem.	Mar der wie in probleem.
This was actually happening.	Dit wie eins bart.
No better place than home.	Gjin better plak as thús.
That is our reason for being.	Dat is ús reden om te wêzen.
The children were tired.	De bern wiene wurch.
No one seems to say a bad word about him.	Nimmen liket in min wurd oer him te sizzen.
I never want to look back on that.	Dêr wol ik noait wer op werom sjen.
I don't know.	Ik wit it net.
But it may not be for everyone.	Mar it kin net foar elkenien wêze.
You may be surprised by what you find.	Jo kinne wurde ferrast troch wat jo fine.
It has always been a family.	It hat altyd in famylje west.
I'm the last person they want.	Ik bin de lêste persoan dy't se wolle.
We hope this does not happen again.	Wy hoopje dat dit net wer bart.
No one else is going after.	Nimmen oars giet nei.
It's not your problem.	It is net dyn probleem.
He really did not want to talk about it.	Hy woe der eins net oer prate.
She loves our city and our people.	Se hâldt fan ús stêd en ús minsken.
And so it goes.	En sa giet it.
He had to say something.	Hy moast wat sizze.
Have you ever had this idea?	Hawwe jo dit idee oait hân?
I would love to see them out there.	Ik mei graach sjen se út dêr.
A job is a job, and money is money.	In baan is in baan, en jild is jild.
The city has some major problems.	De stêd hat wat grutte problemen.
I'm not the only one.	Ik bin net de ienige.
They did not buy the house.	Se hawwe it hûs net kocht.
There was so much to see.	Der wie safolle te sjen.
Even though they will.	Ek al sille se.
It is when they are away from home that it is a concern.	It is as se fuort fan hûs binne dat it in soargen is.
They know what they are and what they are about.	Se witte wat se binne en wêr't se oer geane.
Do you think we should go there?	Tinksto dat wy dêr hinne moatte?
I did not have much to say about that.	Dêr hie ik net folle fan te sizzen.
I do not have it.	Ik haw it net.
If anything has happened to you, please let me know.	As der wat mei jo bard is, lit it my dan witte.
I should be down there.	Ik soe der ûnder wêze moatte.
But that is not for everyone.	Mar dat is net foar elkenien.
This was a first.	Dit wie in earste.
I hope you are happy.	Ik hoopje dat jo bliid binne.
It was probable.	It wie wierskynlik.
He probably had no time to leave.	Hy hie wierskynlik gjin tiid om fuort te gean.
He actually did nothing to find out.	Hy die eins neat om út te finen.
Just keep me out of the way.	Hâld my mar út 'e wei.
You just have to do it.	Jo moatte it gewoan dwaan.
We never do that.	Dat dogge wy noait.
I feel really good about those things.	Ik fiel my echt goed oer dy dingen.
She would see her friend.	Se soe har freon sjen.
He has none.	Hy hat gjinien.
It felt good, and it felt good.	It fielde goed, en it fielde goed.
There has never been such a thing, before or after.	Der hat noch noait sa'n ding west, foar of nei.
Did not take long to do it.	Hie net lang om it te dwaan.
But it will.	Mar it sil.
It works this way.	It wurket op dizze manier.
We look like nothing.	Wy lykje neat op.
There was so much.	Der wie safolle.
I did not wish I was.	Ik woe net dat ik it wie.
Let's just keep it going.	Lit ús it mar hâlde.
Maybe they get it though.	Miskien krije se it wol.
I feel tired.	Ik fiel my wurch.
I just worked.	Ik wurke gewoan.
We'm not sure what, exactly.	Wy binne net wis wat, krekt.
More than last year.	Mear as ferline jier.
All you can do is just be there.	Alles wat jo kinne dwaan is gewoan d'r wêze.
They knew it.	Se wisten it.
I do not want that.	Dat wol ik net.
We had not heard the door open.	Wy hiene de doar net iepen heard.
Not the ego, everyone wanted me to be.	Net de ik, elkenien woe dat ik wêze soe.
There they met for the first time.	Dêr moete se foar it earst.
Not yet, it's going to be a week.	Noch net, it wurdt in wike.
I had to go.	Ik moast gean.
Maybe there was still hope.	Miskien wie der noch hope.
It went as well as you expected.	It gie sa goed as jo ferwachte hiene.
Or think you do.	Of tink dat jo dogge.
No problem, we were happy to do it.	Gjin probleem, wy wiene bliid om it te dwaan.
Or on it.	Of derop.
Someone came.	Der kaam ien.
Enter it.	Jou it yn.
I never saw him with a girl, not the last time.	Ik seach him noait mei in famke, net de lêste tiid.
And that's of course, when she met you.	En dat die se fansels, doe't se dy moete.
He wanted to try something different.	Hy woe wat oars besykje.
To a thing.	Oan in ding.
Well, she says.	No, seit se.
I'll help you.	Ik sil dy helpe.
They may love you.	Se kinne fan dy hâlde.
She liked a lot about him.	Se mocht in protte oer him.
But something to look forward to.	Mar wat om nei út te sjen.
He said nothing about it to his parents.	Dêr sei er tsjin syn âlden neat oer.
It was not quite.	It wie net hielendal.
Better than life.	Better as libben.
Well, sure it is.	No, wis is it.
It was week to week.	It wie wike ta wike.
We can look at that now as well.	Wy kinne der no ek wol nei sjen.
I want to do mine.	Ik wol myn dwaan.
It had gone so hard.	It wie sa hurd gien.
Time to get back to life.	Tiid om werom te gean nei it libben.
We are people of words and hope.	Wy binne minsken fan wurden en hope.
There is so much more happening.	Der bart safolle mear.
Talk to him.	Praat mei him.
It's much better.	It is folle better.
Not unlike another day.	Net oars as in oare dei.
He still had things to do.	Hy hie noch dingen te dwaan.
That was them.	Dat wiene se.
We would find him.	Wy soene him fine.
I have been waiting for it to come.	Ik haw wachte op it kommen.
The girl might like it.	It famke mocht wol.
I doubt they will ever come back.	Ik twifelje oft se oait wer werom komme.
I'm not worried about that.	Ik meitsje my der gjin soargen oer.
I've heard about this.	Ik haw heard oer dit.
Everything seemed more than real.	Alles like mear as echt.
But it also makes them feel bad as words.	Mar it makket se ek min as wurden.
What they do.	Wat se dogge.
Such a good book.	Sa'n goed boek.
My question here and now is.	Myn fraach hjir en no is.
In the same year.	Yn itselde jier.
That's just not.	Dat die se net.
You do not get it.	Jo krije it net.
One two three.	Ien Twa Trije.
I want that for you.	Ik wol dat foar dy.
You did very well.	Jo hawwe it tige goed dien.
This can not really be.	Dit kin net echt wêze.
You can go now, if you want.	Jo kinne no gean, as jo wolle.
I know what this looks like, though.	Ik wit hoe dit liket, mar.
Or on them.	Of op har.
I could not even try it.	Ik koe it net iens besykje.
My father could not know.	Myn heit koe it net witte.
Not that kind.	Net dat soarte.
And everyone knew it.	En elkenien wist dit.
But it would be fun.	Mar it soe leuk wêze.
I know nothing else.	Ik wit neat oars.
Is that really all you have to say?	Is dat echt alles wat jo te sizzen hawwe?
His friends are determined to get him a job.	Syn freonen binne besletten om him in baan te krijen.
I hope to have something free soon.	Ik hoopje gau wat frij te hawwen.
Which tells me two things.	Wat my twa dingen seit.
It was busy.	It wie drok.
Be good or you are the next.	Wês goed of jo binne de folgjende.
His both parents.	Syn beide âlden.
The children were so that no one could see.	De bern wiene sa dat nimmen sjen koe.
I told you, it was a thing.	Ik sei dy, it wie in ding.
I know how to do that.	Ik wit hoe't ik dat dwaan moat.
They were good.	Se wiene goed.
But probably not.	Mar wierskynlik net.
The only reason she did not die was the dog.	De ienige reden dat se net stoar wie de hûn.
Nothing happens without her knowing it.	Der bart neat sûnder dat se it wit.
He looked on.	Hy seach nei.
Take tomorrow too.	Nim moarn ek.
I just did my job.	Ik die krekt myn wurk.
A very beautiful girl.	In hiel moai famke.
His life will never be the same.	Syn libben sil nea wêze itselde.
I'm sure you will do well !.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo sille dwaan it goed!.
She did not need my help.	Se hie myn help net nedich.
But, this should not scare you.	Mar, dit moat jo net bang meitsje.
It just did not work.	It gie gewoan net.
I think she's gone.	Ik tink dat se fuort is.
Nothing much to look forward to.	Neat folle om nei te sjen.
It could not.	It koe net.
Do you want to help with the food?	Wolle jo helpe by it iten?
He had had just enough.	Hy hie krekt genôch hân.
Now just look at one guy in front of me.	Sjoch no krekt ien keardel foar my.
I want to help you.	Ik wol dy helpe.
I hope the best for everyone.	Ik hoopje it bêste foar elkenien.
She's been here long enough.	Se hat hjir lang genôch west.
And over time.	En oer tiid.
I sat too.	Ik siet ek.
People were gone.	Minsken wiene fuort.
I would never leave my kids.	Ik soe myn bern noait litte.
Very, very bad.	Hiel, heul min.
The thing itself.	It ding sels.
They just are not.	Se binne gewoan net.
Well, about why you're here.	No, oer wêrom't jo hjir binne.
The police arrived quickly.	De plysje kaam gau.
I just could not believe she could be so beautiful.	Ik koe gewoan net leauwe dat se sa moai wêze koe.
He does at this hour.	Hy docht oan dit oere.
The latter we have well enough.	Dat lêste hawwe wy goed genôch.
But it was not in mine.	Mar it wie net yn myn.
She knew that well enough.	Dat wist se goed genôch.
He did not know how to do that.	Hy wist dat net te dwaan.
Give of your time.	Jou fan jo tiid.
There was one.	Der wie ien.
But I do not know how to do it.	Mar ik wit net hoe't ik it wurkje moat.
Not to her.	Net oan har.
It's everything and nothing and a few things.	It is alles en neat en in pear dingen.
I can not even eat.	Ik kin net iens ite.
You have to see them.	Jo moatte se sjen.
I do not think you will find many who say they do.	Ik tink net dat jo in protte sille fine dy't sizze dat se dat dogge.
I will work on that.	Dêr sil ik oan wurkje.
I do not know how it should be.	Ik wit net hoe't it moat.
It does not matter who they are.	It makket neat út wa't se binne.
What you have, you have.	Wat jo hawwe, jo hawwe.
Or we, too.	Of wy, ek.
I do not want this.	Ik wol dit net.
There must be something they can not.	Der moat wat wêze dat se net kinne.
I look forward to seeing you again.	Ik sjoch der nei út om dy wer te sjen.
It's good family time.	It is goede famylje tiid.
It made her very happy.	It hat har tige bliid makke.
Well, now they do.	No, no dogge se.
Maybe need to go there again.	Moat der miskien wol wer hinne.
He was happy.	Hy wie bliid.
It was certain she had not read this.	It wie wis dat se dizze net lêzen hie.
A gathering of people.	In gearkomste fan minsken.
I think that was the reason he gave.	Ik tink dat dat de reden wie dy't hy joech.
Never leave him.	Lit him noait.
And so it was.	En sa wie it.
There are many things that happen that way.	D'r binne in protte dingen dy't sa bart.
But this still leaves us with a problem.	Mar dit lit ús noch altyd mei in probleem.
But he has no idea what they're about.	Mar hy hat gjin idee wêr't se oer geane.
She did not think, she just did.	Se tocht net, se die gewoan.
It's more than.	It is mear as.
They would all pay.	Se soene allegear betelje.
I just had to do it.	Ik moast it gewoan dwaan.
None of them were there now.	Dêr wiene no gjinien fan.
It makes me angry.	It makket my lilk.
There is so much more good in you than anything else.	D'r is safolle mear goed yn jo as wat oars.
So far, so good.	Oant no ta liket alles goed.
You can give him easily.	Jo kinne him maklik jaan.
You think you know what you want.	Jo tinke dat jo witte wat jo wolle.
What more do you want ?.	Wat wolle jo mear?.
I know what it is, but that does not matter.	Ik wit wat it is, mar dat makket neat út.
She transferred to another school.	Se gie oer nei in oare skoalle.
That was my first home.	Dat wie myn earste thús.
I just do not.	Ik gewoan net.
She can last two, three years.	Se kin twa, trije jier.
She wanted so, so that her words were true.	Se woe sa, sa dat har wurden wier wiene.
I knew what was happening.	Ik wist wat der barde.
I found you, almost found me?	Ik fûn dy, hast my fûn?
It was an opportunity to do so.	It wie in kâns om dat te dwaan.
But it never happened.	Mar it is noait bard.
I knew nothing.	Ik wist neat.
And, she would get nothing tonight.	En, se soe fannacht neat krije.
She will only speak once.	Se sil mar ien kear prate.
She does not even look bad.	Se sjocht net iens min út.
Not for anything other than a friend.	Net foar wat oars as in freon.
But, that is so now and then.	Mar, dat is sa no en dan.
In the house.	Yn it hûs.
She had a pretty nice life.	Se hie in aardich moai libben.
That could not.	Dat koe net.
There is nothing to say.	Der is neat te sizzen.
But they are different.	Mar se binne oars.
No one has ever loved me.	Nimmen hat oait fan my hâlden.
I want to say two or three things.	Ik wol twa of trije dingen sizze.
Keep track of your questions.	Hâld jo fragen by.
I worry about him.	Ik meitsje my soargen foar him.
I have not tried it.	Ik ha it net besocht.
I just do not know how.	Ik wit gewoan net hoe.
She does not let me.	Se lit my net.
Ask her what she likes and why.	Freegje har wat se leuk fine en wêrom.
We're almost done here.	Wy binne hjir hast klear.
I think it's nice to see them.	Ik tink dat it moai is dat se sjen litte.
The truth is that it is for everyone.	De wierheid is dat it foar elkenien is.
We are tired and only two.	Wy binne wurch en mar twa.
We know what we can do here.	Wy witte wat wy hjir kinne dwaan.
So, so beautiful.	Sa, sa moai.
Now this will not hurt a little.	No sil dit net in bytsje sear dwaan.
I want those two to talk.	Ik wol dat dy twa prate.
He did not think he would.	Hy tocht net dat er dat soe.
That will not be easy.	Dat sil net maklik wurde.
And you have to keep that in mind.	En jo moatte it yn gedachten hawwe.
I'm so glad you're here.	Ik bin sa bliid dat jo hjir binne.
You need to see what you can find there.	Jo moatte sjen wat jo kinne fine dêr.
The problem is ourselves.	It probleem is ús sels.
Everything will have its time when it comes.	Alles sil syn tiid hawwe as it komt.
You will do what you said.	Jo sille dwaan wat jo seine.
She's been old since last we met.	Se is âld sûnt lêste wy moete.
But he will eat with us.	Mar hy sil mei ús iten.
There was no way this was going to happen.	D'r wie gjin manier dat dit soe dwaan.
He saw things.	Hy seach dingen.
So you will have to be very careful.	Sa sille jo tige foarsichtich wêze moatte.
We take it one day for one.	Wy nimme it ien dei foar ien.
There was not much to say.	Der wie net folle te sizzen.
Now it was very different.	No wie it hiel oars.
We have to go.	Wy moatte gean.
The photo shows him at a party.	De foto lit him sjen op in feest.
Why even try ?.	Wêrom sels besykje?.
Well, let me think.	No, lit my tinke.
It's just wrong.	It is gewoan ferkeard.
You have to do it your way.	Jo moatte jo manier dwaan.
But that does not seem to help.	Mar dat liket net te helpen.
Money is needed.	Jild is nedich.
Not at all.	Dat hielendal net.
I have not told this to anyone.	Ik haw dit oan nimmen ferteld.
Nothing but that.	Neat oars as dat.
That should stop.	Dat moat ophâlde.
But we can handle it.	Mar wy kinne it oan.
I just don’t feel that much anymore.	Ik fiel it gewoan net mear sa folle.
He wanted to show them to his friends.	Hy woe har sjen litte oan syn freonen.
It asked a lot of them.	It frege in protte fan har.
He could never tell her that.	Dat koe er har nea sizze.
And you are.	En do bist.
I still love you.	Ik hâld noch altyd fan dy.
I just needed someone to give me a chance.	Ik hie gewoan ien nedich om my in kâns te jaan.
I would have given you one.	Ik soe dy ien jûn hawwe.
What happened next.	Wat wie der bard nei.
And now, here we were.	En no, hjir wiene wy.
He was ready for me.	Hy wie klear foar my.
I do not think so.	Dat tink ik net.
She started after that.	Se begûn der nei.
He wanted to make it very clear.	Hy woe it hiel dúdlik meitsje.
but really, it was a good day.	mar echt, it wie in goede dei.
Man and dog.	Man en hûn.
I did not like to say that.	Dat sei ik net graach.
Go and see for yourself.	Gean en sjoch sels.
The man will be there to feed the dog.	De man sil der wêze om de hûn te iten.
But it had come.	Mar it wie kommen.
Food is here.	Iten is hjir.
We need you.	Wy ha dy nedich.
He did not want to go.	Hy woe net gean.
Nobody knows.	Nimmen wit it.
But that may never happen.	Mar dat mei nea barre.
And much more ready.	En folle mear klear.
It will never be seen in the movie again.	It sil nea wer te sjen wêze yn 'e film.
She's not ready to come out yet.	Se is noch net ree om út te kommen.
Sure, he just knew me.	Wis, hy koe my net.
Do better in school today.	Doch hjoed better op skoalle.
Until they did no more.	Oant se net mear diene.
He would not get it.	Hy soe it net krije.
All her family is like that.	Al har famylje is sa.
If not for me.	As net foar my.
On the same day.	Op deselde dei.
You help so many kids out there.	Jo helpe safolle bern út dêr.
First you need two	Earst moatte jo twa
And who knows, maybe it is.	En wa wit, miskien is it.
She did not want any of that.	Dêr woe se neat fan.
Let's get together.	Litte wy tegearre komme.
Which it is of course.	Wat it is fansels.
And do not know.	En wit it net.
I never liked her.	Ik haw har noait leuk fûn.
I really can not wait for that day.	Ik kin echt net wachtsje op dy dei.
As if she had from him.	As hie se fan him.
But that is not what this question is about.	Mar dêr giet dizze fraach net oer.
There's another one.	Der is noch ien.
Otherwise, not bad.	Oars, net min.
No one else was told.	Nimmen oars waard ferteld.
It's done.	It is dien.
I did not think you were.	Ik tocht net dat jo wiene.
She told them off.	Se fertelde har ôf.
Still, no idea came to him.	Noch altyd kaam der gjin idee by him.
Then there are some major issues here.	Dan binne d'r hjir in pear grutte problemen.
They would be home.	Se soene thús wêze.
What does he look like?	Hoe sjocht hy der út?
Without it, you have nothing.	Sûnder it, do hast neat.
I do not think anyone did it.	Ik tink net dat nimmen it die.
And it is.	En it is.
They know they are.	Se witte dat se binne.
And not just us.	En net allinnich wy.
Please, just do it.	Asjebleaft, doch it gewoan.
Nothing can hurt you.	Neat kin jo sear dwaan.
He does not look well.	Hy sjocht der net goed út.
And this girl.	En dit famke.
There was nothing to see.	Der wie neat te sjen.
Could not believe it.	Koe it net leauwe.
He was not exactly sure how it would work.	Hy wie net krekt wis hoe't it wurkje soe.
That he should know.	Dat moast er witte.
We are with you in this work.	Wy binne mei jo yn dit wurk.
No place for a woman there.	Gjin plak foar in frou dêr.
Now and then.	Út en troch.
I could not do it.	Ik koe it net dwaan.
He knew she would not believe him, of course.	Hy wist dat se him fansels net leauwe soe.
She did it.	Se hat it dien.
Maybe she was there too.	Miskien wie se der ek.
But here's the truth.	Mar hjir is de wierheid.
So good enough.	Sa goed genôch.
There was a very early.	Der wie in hiel betiid.
But keep at it.	Mar hâld der oan.
She could do nothing.	Se koe neat dwaan.
He comes for us.	Hy komt foar ús.
Most likely she would never see him again.	Hiel wierskynlik soe se him noait wer sjen.
I help you, you help me.	Ik help dy, do help my.
I just felt it.	Ik fielde it gewoan.
That may not be enough.	Dat kin net genôch wêze.
We are just a man and a woman.	Wy binne mar in man en frou.
Was worried about you more.	Wie soargen oer dy mear.
Let's take it word for word.	Litte wy it wurd foar wurd nimme.
They had their day with me.	Se hawwe har dei mei my hân.
She does not eat.	Se yt net.
We need to give it time.	Wy moatte it tiid jaan.
Why me? 	Wêrom ik?
We do not know when.	Wy witte net wannear.
Three said he would try.	Trije seine dat er besykje soe.
We have to be very careful though.	Wy moatte wol hiel foarsichtich wêze.
I'll have to make it clear.	Ik sil it dúdlik meitsje moatte.
This was our house.	Dit wie ús hûs.
Do it really this time.	Doch it dizze kear echt.
That you may know better what you are saying.	Dat jo kinne better witte wat jo sizze.
It will not do any good.	It sil gjin goed dwaan.
But she should have known better.	Mar se hie better witte moatten.
It does not matter anymore.	It docht net mear.
You work hard enough.	Jo wurkje genôch.
You do not know how to take care of someone.	Jo witte net hoe't jo om ien soargje moatte.
There was no one there.	Dêr wie net ien.
Must be.	Moat wêze.
There is no life in it at all.	Der is hielendal gjin libben yn.
They want to go back to what they once knew.	Se wolle werom nei wat se ea wisten.
I do not know why this is happening.	Ik wit net wêrom dit bart.
They help you solve the problem.	Se helpe jo it probleem oan te jaan.
Neither of us really knew why.	Net ien fan ús wist echt wêrom.
Do not tell anyone.	Fertel it net oan ien.
You have three days.	Jo hawwe trije dagen.
And it works very well.	En it wurket hiel goed.
He took his time.	Hy naam syn tiid.
They can do it better for you.	Se kinne it better foar jo dwaan.
The truth will set us free.	De wierheid sil ús frij meitsje.
I gave it another few hours.	Ik joech it noch in pear oeren.
There is nothing there.	Der is neat dêr.
Looking forward to seeing you again.	Sjoch út nei sjoch dy wer.
He took two.	Hy naam twa.
I knew all that.	Dat koe ik allegear.
You can be seen.	Jo kinne sjoen wurde.
And they did.	En dat hiene se dien.
And she knows it.	En se wit it.
The man worked on everything.	De man wurke oan alles.
Visit me if you have a chance.	Besykje my as jo in kâns hawwe.
What was it, he asked himself.	Wat wie it, frege er him ôf.
They are ready with you.	Se binne klear mei dy.
Not just you.	Net allinnich jo.
And still not.	En noch altyd net.
He saw his friend every day.	Hy seach syn freon alle dagen.
That she asked me for money.	Dat se my om jild frege.
It's not all bad either.	It is ek net allegear min.
I can not leave it.	Ik kin it net litte.
We've been there before.	Wy ha der al earder west.
He did not seem to have any good friends.	Hy like gjin goede freonen te hawwen.
I've never seen that in a woman before.	Dat haw ik noch noait earder by in frou sjoen.
They will not buy them.	Se sille se net keapje.
What he felt as.	Wat hy die fielde as.
They have never been like this.	Se hawwe noch noait sa west.
But let's get out of here first.	Mar litte wy hjir earst wei.
But there is much more than that.	Mar der is folle mear as dat.
If you're old enough, what neither of you is.	As jo ​​​​âld genôch binne, wat gjinien fan jo is.
But it's just not true.	Mar it is gewoan net wier.
Would not want it any other way.	Soe it net oars wolle.
But if you take the time to.	Mar as jo nimme de tiid om.
They do go out with people.	Se geane wol út mei minsken.
We would never do anything to hurt you.	Wy soene noait wat dwaan om jo sear te meitsjen.
So we do it.	Sa dogge wy it.
I can see you doing.	Ik kin sjen dat jo dogge.
he asked.	hy frege.
I love these people here.	Ik hâld fan dizze minsken hjir.
This is enough for many people, but not all.	Dit is genôch foar in protte minsken, mar net allegear.
In truth, we both need it.	Yn wierheid hawwe wy beide nedich.
They will be waiting for you.	Se sille op dy wachtsje.
He looked over at me.	Hy seach oer my.
But it had been there.	Mar it hie der west.
Day of the month.	Dei fan 'e moanne.
He has this.	Hy hat dit.
But you have to be careful.	Mar jo moatte foarsichtich wêze.
I would be too.	Ik soe ek wêze.
We're doing it right.	Wy dogge it goed.
We do this twice.	Wy dogge dit twa kear.
I do not know anything else.	Ik wit net wat oars.
They said little.	Se seine bytsje.
He found it.	Hy fûn it.
Then it becomes an idea.	Dan wurdt it in idee.
He could not believe what he had just done.	Hy koe net leauwe wat er krekt dien hie.
But we are still a family.	Mar wy binne noch in famylje.
I get angry too.	Ik wurd ek lilk.
She had to do it now.	Se moast it no dwaan.
We would not be able to do that.	Dat soene wy ​​net kinne kinne.
Everything is as real as it is now.	Alles is sa echt as it no is.
Now what? 	No wat?
I'll come back to that.	Dêr kom ik op werom.
This is just everyone, of course.	Dit is net elkenien, fansels.
Until just the.	Oant se net die.
It is now too.	It is no ek.
They shouldn’t either.	Se moatte ek net.
What is your favorite type of food?	Wat is dyn favorite soarte fan iten?
We have never been the same.	Wy hawwe nea west itselde.
Three hours late.	Trije oeren te let.
We were too.	Wy wiene ek.
She was so helpful.	Se wie safolle help.
It was not even pretty.	It wie net iens moai.
I was also planning to go back to work next week.	Ik wie ek fan plan om de folgjende wike wer oan it wurk te gean.
I'll give you another one, just as well.	Ik jou dy noch ien, like goed.
Get me back.	Gean my werom.
A year ago.	In jier lyn.
She left a few days ago.	Se gie in pear dagen lyn fuort.
I'm his mother now.	Ik bin no syn mem.
I can not tell him.	Ik kin it him net fertelle.
I will ask many of you.	Ik sil in protte fan dy freegje.
I was happy for him.	Ik wie bliid foar him.
It's just easy.	Dit is net maklik.
I wonder if she ever thinks that way about us.	Ik freegje my ôf oft se oait sa oan ús tinke.
And that was them.	En dat wiene se.
They are happy to see us in the city.	Se binne bliid ús yn 'e stêd te sjen.
I do not think it hurts any of us.	Ik tink net dat it ien fan ús sear docht.
I really think this works.	Ik tink echt dat dit wurket.
More of everything.	Mear fan alles.
Or she came to him.	Of se kaam by him.
And she would not know that if she did not go.	En dat soe se net witte as se net gie.
So we got the guy to go and open the door.	Sa krigen wy de keardel om te gean en de doar iepen te dwaan.
Tell me, tell me.	Fertel my, fertel my.
And the other.	En de oare.
More of the same this year.	Mear fan itselde dit jier.
I think it's not there yet.	Ik tink dat it der noch net is.
We have not done much.	Wy hawwe net folle dien.
And so we do nothing.	En sa dogge wy neat.
They love him.	Se hâlde fan him.
That man took her away.	Dy man naam har fuort.
I want to get better tomorrow.	Ik wol moarn better wurde.
He wanted more, much more.	Hy woe mear, folle mear.
No one was sure he was saying anything.	Nimmen wie wis, dat hy sei neat.
If we do not get it now, we will never get it.	As wy it no net krije, sille wy it noait krije.
I'm glad you're here.	Ik bin bliid dat jo hjir binne.
I'm glad she's nice to him.	Ik bin bliid dat se aardich tsjin him is.
He would not be able to do that.	Hy soe dit net kinne.
I may not be here at all.	Ik mei hjir hielendal net wêze.
I had it right in there.	Ik hie it der krekt yn.
What more can be said.	Wat mear kin sein wurde.
He looked at his friends.	Hy seach nei syn freonen.
Invite the child to talk.	Meitsje it bern oan om te praten.
But everything was different now.	Mar alles wie no oars.
I have this.	Ik haw dit.
His father told him to get a job.	Syn heit fertelde him om in baan te krijen.
Doesn't matter anymore.	Makket der net mear út.
I can not spend much time.	Ik kin net folle tiid.
It was nice to see them again.	It wie moai om se wer te sjen.
I was afraid this would happen.	Ik wie bang dat dit barre soe.
I saw first hand the good and not so good.	Ik seach earste hân it goede en net sa goed.
And there was nothing.	En der wie neat.
She would be there.	Se soe der wêze.
They do it well.	Se dogge it goed.
But do nothing.	Mar doch neat.
She tells me now.	Se fertelle my no.
We never talk.	Wy prate noait.
It happened again.	It is wer bard.
We will be here if you need us.	Wy sille hjir wêze as jo ús nedich hawwe.
Wait a minute.	Wachtsje noch wat.
He could see that they had.	Hy koe sjen dat se hiene.
Not with me.	Net mei my.
Of course it has to.	Fansels moat it.
We are not, it's so open.	Wy binne net, it is sa iepen.
But they all did.	Mar dat diene se allegear.
I'm interested in you.	Ik bin ynteressearre yn dy.
I think she wanted to.	Ik tink dat se woe.
I think she was.	Ik tink dat se wie.
It is the word of the time.	It is it wurd fan de tiid.
It went up.	It gie op.
And of course,.	En fansels,.
Do what it is that does this.	Doch wat it is dat dit docht.
Then the first child goes out.	Dan giet it earste bern út.
They will not.	Dat sille se net.
It's easy to find this book.	It is maklik om dit boek te finen.
And that's it.	En dat is it.
You too, man.	Jo ek, man.
I have no idea how to do that.	Ik haw gjin idee hoe te dwaan dat.
But he did not do the same.	Mar hy die net itselde.
But do not be so sure.	Mar wês net sa wis.
I'm sorry if that's not enough for you.	It spyt my as dat net genôch is foar jo.
He told her he could do it himself.	Hy fertelde har dat er it sels dwaan koe.
A book, perhaps.	In boek, miskien.
That was real.	Dat wie echt.
But he was not.	Mar hy wie net.
They were not nice to look at.	Se wiene net aardich om te sjen.
If so, can someone show me how.	As dat sa is, kin immen my sjen litte hoe.
What a life.	Wat in libben.
It's their money.	It is har jild.
They were needed for work.	Se wiene nedich foar wurk.
We're leaving here very soon.	Wy geane hjir hiel gau fuort.
But he was still our father.	Mar hy wie noch altyd ús heit.
Alone together, they seem to be something to buy.	Allinnich tegearre lykje se wat te wêzen om te keapjen.
He knew something, but she wasn't sure what exactly.	Hy wist wat, mar se wie net wis wat krekt.
I want to talk to her.	Ik wol wol mei har prate.
But it does not have to be.	Mar it hoecht net te wêzen.
These were so easy and fun to make.	Dizze wiene sa maklik en leuk om te meitsjen.
Everyone knew it.	Elkenien wist it.
So it was with me.	Sa wie it mei my.
All of these are beautiful.	Al dizze binne moai.
Yours will be too.	Dyn sil ek wêze.
She does not want to go.	Se wol net gean.
We hope you enjoy the experience.	Wy hoopje dat jo wer besykje kinne.
That did not happen.	Sa barde it net.
.	.
If you really go through with this.	As jo ​​echt gean troch mei dit.
But it does not occur to me.	Mar it komt my net oer.
He should have left.	Hy hie fuort moatten.
And no more.	En net mear.
They were very nice.	Se wiene hiel aardich.
She would, she looked back.	Se soe, se seach werom.
So life is gone.	Sa is it libben fuort.
I worked my whole life.	Ik wurke myn hiele libben.
No one knows what happened.	Net ien wit wat der bard is.
I do not want to say anything.	Ik wol neat sizze.
That hurt too.	Dat die ek sear.
Well, you're wrong.	No, do bist ferkeard.
Anyone can do work.	Elkenien kin wurk dwaan.
There really are none.	Der binne echt gjin.
Everything remained in her.	Alles bleau yn har.
Often from an evening.	Faak fan in jûn.
I was a person.	Ik wie in persoan.
The kids love her.	De bern hâlde fan har.
It will not happen again.	It sil net wer barre.
Or agree with him.	Of mei him iens.
I've done work.	Ik haw wurk dien.
Think carefully before you buy it.	Tink foarsichtich foardat jo it keapje.
Maybe you can make him better.	Miskien kinne jo him better meitsje.
There must be something we can do.	Der moat wat wêze dat wy dwaan kinne.
She did not seem angry.	Se like net lilk.
Well, I've gotten sick a few times.	No, ik bin in pear kear siik wurden.
I'm sure you're tired.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo wurch binne.
I need to know that you can do that.	Ik moat witte dat jo dat kinne.
He told her about his work.	Hy fertelde har oer syn wurk.
I was too.	Ik wie ek.
No going back !.	Gjin werom!.
I just know they can not do otherwise.	Ik wit gewoan dat se net oars kinne.
I still love the baby.	Ik hâld noch fan it bern.
They were both surprised.	Se wiene beide ferrast.
But he was different.	Mar hy wie oars.
You surprised me.	Jo hawwe my ferrast.
You do not do it that way.	Jo dogge it net sa.
I know this.	Ik wit dit.
The woman is reading.	De frou is oan it lêzen.
And you were wrong.	En jo wiene ferkeard.
Everyone should have been happy.	Elkenien hie bliid wêze moatten.
But there is something more.	Mar der is wat mear.
It took up a lot of his time.	It naam in protte fan syn tiid.
Maybe you should stay home today.	Miskien moatte jo hjoed thús bliuwe.
Maybe she wants to talk.	Miskien wol se prate.
That or you may have done something wrong.	Dat of jo hawwe miskien wat ferkeard dien.
This time of year is no different.	Dizze tiid fan it jier is net oars.
Not by hand.	Net troch de hân.
Would you please do this for me?	Wolle jo dit asjebleaft foar my dwaan?
Those three were children.	Dy trije wiene bern.
I waited all year.	Ik wachte it hiele jier.
That had to be good.	Dat moast goed.
Two could play as easily as one.	Twa koene sa maklik as ien spylje.
I know this is the way.	Ik wit dat dit de manier is.
Or he does.	Of hy docht.
I would get some from the other kids.	Ik soe wat fan 'e oare bern krije.
There were a few people left.	Der wiene in pear minsken oer.
I need to talk to her.	Ik moat mei har prate.
He was very good.	Hy wie tige goed.
I'm trying to be interested.	Ik besykje ynteressearre te wêzen.
It probably did a lot more.	It die nei alle gedachten noch folle mear.
The police stopped the car.	De plysje sette de auto oan.
I just got home.	Ik kom krekt thús.
We'll talk about it a bit.	Wy sille it der oer in bytsje oer prate.
We are a couple.	Wy binne in pear.
He did not want to tell.	Hy woe it net fertelle.
It's hard to say so early.	It is dreech om sa betiid te sizzen.
I ask her why.	Ik freegje har wêrom.
Until a few years ago.	Oant in pear jier lyn.
What exactly did he say?	Wat sei er krekt?
Just like last time.	Krekt as de lêste kear.
That's not my name.	Dat is myn namme net.
But one of these should work.	Mar ien fan dizze moat wurkje.
I know her.	Ik ken har.
Everyone was happy for him.	Elkenien wie bliid foar him.
It could not.	It koe net.
But that's not a problem.	Mar dat is gjin probleem.
They let them eat what they eat.	Se litte har ite wat se ite.
Three more hours.	Noch trije oeren.
He went for it.	Hy gie der foar.
You can handle this.	Jo kinne dit oan.
These people need to go.	Dizze minsken moatte gean.
It is no different for humans.	It is net oars foar minsken.
So many kids, so bad food.	Safolle bern, sa min iten.
He left you that.	Hy liet dy dat.
I just do not do it.	Ik doch it gewoan net.
You know, they have a word.	Jo witte, se hawwe in wurd.
Do not worry about being ready.	Meitsje jo gjin soargen oer klear wêze.
Just for me.	Krekt foar my.
So I'm not sure what it does.	Dat ik bin der net wis fan wat it docht.
I saw it today.	Ik haw it hjoed sjoen.
It does not matter what people think.	It makket net út wat minsken tinke.
How sick we do not know.	Hoe siik witte wy net.
And he did.	En dat die er wol.
People around here like to eat.	Minsken om hjir hinne graach ite.
Well, we've talked enough.	No, wy hawwe genôch praat.
One thing to keep in mind.	Ien ding om yn gedachten te hâlden.
There's a lot in it.	Der sit in protte yn.
That should have been expected.	Dat hie ferwachte wurde moatten.
She must have.	Se moat hawwe.
No one went to see.	Nimmen gie te sjen.
We need to get out of there.	Wy moatte der út.
Another day, he thought.	In oare dei, tocht er.
Well, it works.	No, it wurket.
I have nothing ready.	Ik ha neat klear.
You can not tell how things will go.	Jo kinne net fertelle hoe't dingen sille gean.
It did not feel enough but it felt better.	It fielde net genôch mar it fielde better.
Come on, give me what.	Kom op, jou my wat.
I love talking to people.	Ik hâld fan praten mei minsken.
Of course we were worried.	Fansels wiene wy ​​soargen.
He can pretty quickly do nothing in anything.	Hy kin frij gau neat yn wat meitsje.
It just seems like it.	It liket derop mar.
Mom was so beautiful.	Mem wie sa moai.
That has never happened before.	Dat is noch noait earder bard.
Whether he likes money.	Oft er graach jild.
So it is that you do not take money.	Sa is it dat jo gjin jild nimme.
He did his last book there and goes back.	Hy die dêr syn lêste boek en giet werom.
He did agree with her plan.	Hy die wol mei oan har plan.
I told you where.	Ik sei dy wêr.
I had to tell one, everyone.	Ik moast it ien fertelle, elkenien.
They had enough to worry about.	Se hiene genôch om har soargen oer te meitsjen.
We can too.	Wy kinne ek.
Now is not the time to say, not until we know more.	No is net de tiid om te sizzen, net oant wy mear witte.
Have enough food and water.	Hawwe genôch iten en wetter.
But there is no time now.	Mar der is no gjin tiid.
I just love him.	Ik hâld gewoan fan him.
Then again, there was another often of the party.	Dan wer wie der in oare faak fan it feest.
Maybe no one would have even gone to jail.	Miskien soe nimmen sels nei de finzenis gien wêze.
Everyone looked at him, waited.	Elkenien seach him oan, wachte.
I still know her.	Ik wit har noch.
He lived on his own.	Hy wenne op himsels.
Maybe he's busy.	Miskien hat er it drok.
I want to know what she said.	Ik wol witte wat se sei.
And we need you here.	En wy hawwe jo hjir nedich.
But not both.	Mar net beide.
This was my only chance.	Dit wie myn ienige kâns.
That makes our money.	Dat docht ús jild.
You do not act as if it is not.	Jo dogge net as dat it net is.
Well, time for bed now.	No, tiid foar bêd no.
This is the way to the water.	Dit is de wei nei it wetter.
They said it with him and himself.	Se seine it mei him en sels.
A photo of you as a child?	In foto fan dy as bern?
Keep him there.	Hâld him dêr.
Now you do not say.	No sizze jo net.
The work was not done.	It wurk wie net dien.
You're my best friend.	Do bist myn bêste freon.
Will do this again.	Sil dit wer meitsje.
You know, whatever you want to do, it can be done here.	Jo witte, wat jo ek wolle dwaan, it kin hjir dien wurde.
You just do not have the time.	Jo hawwe gewoan de tiid net.
They will find us this time too.	Se sille ús dizze kear ek fine.
I'm not sure which one.	Ik bin der net wis fan hokker.
It's not like they can not, or if they have not in the past.	It is net sa as se net kinne, of as se net yn it ferline hawwe.
Not now he's in there.	Net no is er der yn.
There were other good things too.	Der wiene ek oare goede dingen.
I'm helping a friend with this problem.	Ik help in freon mei dit probleem.
It was not her first time on the bike.	It wie net har earste kear op 'e fyts.
Look at our kind.	Sjoch nei ús soarte.
At the door she did not want to think.	Oan de doar woe se net tinke.
People know it.	Minsken witte it.
It hurt to talk.	It die sear om te praten.
Can be true.	Kin wier wêze.
Let it happen.	Lit it barre.
There is no going back.	Der is gjin wei werom.
I let him do what he wanted with me.	Ik liet him dwaan wat er mei my woe.
They will help next weekend.	Se sille it folgjende wykein helpe.
I'm not the only one who can do that.	Ik bin net de iennichste dy't dat kin.
I do not want anyone to see this.	Ik wol net dat ien dit sjocht.
And you asked for it here.	En jo hawwe hjir om frege.
That child was me.	Dat bern wie ik.
It's likely she won't.	It is wierskynlik dat se net sil.
But this was good for him.	Mar dit wie goed foar him.
It will take you three days.	It sil jo trije dagen nimme.
At work, she said.	Oan it wurk, sei se.
Take it from someone who knows.	Nim it fan ien dy't it wit.
Before you maybe have someone you then.	Foardat jo miskien hawwe immen jo dan.
But try it.	Mar besykje it.
I thought you were for me.	Ik tocht dat jo foar my wiene.
I can pay you.	Ik kin jo betelje.
He had not had more than a year.	Hy hie net mear as in jier.
He could not have both.	Hy koe net beide hawwe.
I sat in front of it.	Ik siet der foar.
See what we have.	Sjoch wat wy hawwe.
They are not, of course.	Se binne net, fansels.
We can handle it.	Wy kinne it oan.
Maybe we should take a few days off.	Miskien moatte wy in pear dagen frij nimme.
This was her way.	Dit wie har manier.
But two things.	Mar twa dingen.
Not that you will not.	Net dat jo it al net sille.
That you do not have to worry.	Dat jo hoege jo gjin soargen te meitsjen.
This city has something for everyone.	Dizze stêd hat wat foar elkenien.
She had the children.	Se krige de bern.
The young man needed money.	De jonge man hie jild nedich.
She's wrong again.	Se is wer ferkeard.
I wonder if.	Ik freegje my sels ôf oft.
He left him in the house.	Hy liet him yn 'e hûs.
My friend did not like it.	Myn freon fûn it net leuk.
These people are very wrong.	Dizze minsken binne tige ferkeard.
But only for you.	Mar allinnich foar dy.
They are against it.	Se binne der op tsjin.
He did just that.	Dat die er krekt.
His mother is free to do whatever she wants.	Syn mem is frij om te dwaan wat se wol.
This worked very well for me.	Dit wurke hiel goed foar my.
I'm going to a friend's.	Ik gean nei in freon.
Do something about it now.	Doch der no wat oan.
And it worked.	En it wurke.
I was in a meeting.	Ik wie yn in gearkomste.
She had in the past.	Se hie yn it ferline.
I'm a teacher.	Ik bin in learaar.
We'll see how it goes.	Wy sille sjen hoe't it giet.
Where anything can happen.	Wêr't alles barre kin.
There is nothing for you to worry about.	D'r is neat foar jo om soargen te meitsjen.
We need to get better here as soon as we can.	Wy moatte hjir better sa gau as wy kinne.
He works there.	Hy wurket dêr.
There are still two years to go.	Dêr wachtsje noch twa jier op.
It's this weekend and next weekend some time off.	It is dit wykein en takom wykein wat tiid frij.
But they are children.	Mar it binne bern.
That had to be it.	Dat moast it wêze.
It told her nothing.	It sei har neat.
She has to take care of me.	Se moat foar my soargje.
And the time is.	En de tiid is.
It is very clear what you need to do.	It is hiel dúdlik wat jo dwaan moatte.
I certainly would have done things differently.	Ik soe dingen wis oars dien hawwe.
She so wants to see you again.	Se wol sa graach dy wer sjen.
She would be no help.	Se soe gjin help wêze.
I take nothing for granted.	Ik nim neat foar fansels.
It might not be, but here we are.	It soe net kinne, mar hjir binne wy.
I did not even know if they were male or female.	Ik wist net iens oft se man of frou wiene.
This gave him hope.	Dit joech him hope.
But we probably should not.	Mar wy moatte wierskynlik net.
And something else.	En noch wat.
It just went off.	It gie gewoan ôf.
He was not interested in her.	Hy wie net ynteressearre yn har.
Nothing, and never.	Neat, en nea.
You have to get out of there yourself.	Jo moatte der sels út komme.
But think about it.	Mar tink der mar oer nei.
Then we'll just go on.	Dan geane wy ​​mar troch.
He would never have to go out again.	Hy soe noait wer út moatte.
Nobody says that.	Nimmen seit dat.
I have a husband who is a good father to his children.	Ik haw in man dy't in goede heit is foar syn bern.
I've never been there today.	Ik ha der hjoed noch nea west.
And the only door goes through you.	En de ienige doar giet troch dy.
Not even back.	Net iens werom.
I should have just left it at that.	Ik hie it mar litte moatten.
I do not see how we can do it.	Ik sjoch net hoe't wy it kinne.
Be right back.	Sa werom.
A new movie.	In nije film.
He seemed to like it.	Hy like der fan te hâlden.
We can all see that this is wrong.	Wy kinne allegear sjen dat dit ferkeard is.
He looked again.	Hy seach wer.
He just needs to keep thinking well.	Hy moat gewoan goed tinke bliuwe.
And there is.	En der is.
Wherever he wants to go.	Wêr't er hinne wol.
Food is life.	Iten is it libben.
He went back home tired.	Hy gie wurch werom nei hûs.
But that did not stop there.	Mar dêr bleau it net by.
He wanted them both.	Hy woe se beide.
Nobody likes him.	Nimmen liket him.
They just weren’t for me.	Se wiene gewoan net foar my.
I wish you would let me go now.	Ik winskje dat jo my no gean litte.
With two children and a husband.	Mei twa bern en in man.
That's what he thinks.	Dat tinkt er.
There's another one coming.	Der komt noch ien.
I was just going to see what was going on.	Ik wie gewoan gien om te sjen wat der oan de hân wie.
The time is almost up.	De tiid is hast om.
You did it right.	Jo hawwe it goed dien.
There is nothing to do now.	Der is no neat te dwaan.
They were not even really my parents.	Se wiene net iens echt myn âlden.
This was something more.	Dit wie wat mear.
I have idea.	Ik haw idee.
He would worry.	Hy soe soargen.
Everyone looked at me.	Elkenien seach my oan.
Not very good.	Net hiel goed.
He set out on his own.	Hy sette op himsels út.
But you have to get back to work.	Mar jo moatte wer oan it wurk.
It will never be the same!	It sil nea wêze itselde!
That's what it does.	Dat docht it.
Nobody sees.	Nimmen sjocht.
But actually it is not good.	Mar eins is it net goed.
There was nothing to see for me.	Der wie neat foar my te sjen.
One time is enough in my book.	Ien kear is genôch yn myn boek.
It's very easy.	It is hiel maklik.
He did not even have to say it.	Hy hoegde it net iens te sizzen.
He does not always do it.	Hy docht it net altyd.
Many of us have gone to school together.	In protte fan ús binne tegearre nei skoalle gien.
He is often ill.	Hy is faak siik.
She had many friends.	Se hie in protte freonen.
The young mother came home late.	De jonge mem kaam let thús.
I want it from her.	Ik wol dat it fan har is.
It was clear enough.	It wie dúdlik genôch.
And by all accounts at.	En nei alle gedachten by.
Wait, those are just two.	Wachtsje, dat binne mar twa.
We just have to try.	Wy moatte gewoan besykje.
They will do what they want.	Se sille dwaan wat se wolle.
You know what is right and what is wrong.	Jo witte wat goed is en wat ferkeard is.
I do not know how they do it.	Ik wit net hoe't se it dogge.
I did not ask, she did not give up.	Ik frege net, se joech net oan.
I asked him why he was doing it.	Ik frege him wêrom hy it docht.
Finally, ask us.	As lêste, freegje ús.
They get it.	Se krije it.
And then we can not.	En dan kinne wy ​​net.
I'll give it a better name.	Ik sil it in bettere namme jaan.
Now she was angry.	No wie se lilk.
You would be easy.	Jo soene maklik wêze.
Let no one tell you who you are.	Lit gjinien jo fertelle wa't jo binne.
He had lived with her for almost two years.	Hy hie hast twa jier by har wenne.
Tell us nothing.	Fertel ús neat.
It looked like that.	It like derop.
He looked at the city.	Hy seach nei de stêd.
If you want to help, let us know.	As jo ​​helpe wolle, lit it ús dan witte.
It will not be the last of course.	It sil net de lêste wêze fansels.
You need to give me something.	Jo moatte my wat jaan.
And you never know about these things.	En jo witte noait oer dizze dingen.
I took his money.	Ik naam syn jild.
It happens, it's there.	It bart, it is der.
These things are not true.	Dizze dingen binne net wier.
But the truth had to be seen.	Mar de wierheid moast sjoen wurde.
But that will not happen.	Mar dat sil net barre.
That man looks very much like her.	Dy man liket har tige op.
So she was happy.	Sa wie se bliid.
I'm just doing something that works for me and my family.	Ik doch gewoan wat foar my en myn famylje wurket.
It was probably nothing.	It wie wierskynlik neat.
I would love for us to go there.	Ik soe graach wolle dat wy der hinne geane.
He looked at the big man.	Hy seach nei de grutte man.
That did two things.	Dat die twa dingen.
You know how to do it now.	Jo witte hoe te dwaan it no.
We will be back for sure !.	Wy komme foar wis werom!.
Nothing scares me.	Neat makket my bang.
We do not have much chance of getting out, and we know it.	Wy hawwe net folle kâns om út te kommen, en wy witte it.
She was expected to do so.	Se waard ferwachte dat te dwaan.
A house is a house is.	In hûs is in hûs is.
I'm fine.	ik, goed.
And they can do this over and over again.	En se kinne dit wer en wer dwaan.
Or, perhaps, ever.	Of, miskien, ea.
I had to leave the house.	Ik moast it hûs út.
She saw him now, there was nothing he could do about it.	Se seach him no, neat koe er der oan dwaan.
Not before, and not now.	Net earder, en net no.
I do not let them.	Ik lit se net.
The time had come.	De tiid wie kommen.
I have a very good plan.	Ik haw in hiel goed plan.
I have a plan for you and me.	Ik haw in plan foar jo en my.
But he would take his time.	Mar hy soe syn tiid nimme.
I do not know very well what's going on.	Ik wit net sa goed wat der oan de hân is.
It's your problem.	It is dyn probleem.
Nobody saw anything.	Nimmen seach wat.
Very nice, she said.	Hiel moai, sei se.
I do not want to talk anymore.	Ik wol net mear prate.
They have been doing this since she was a child.	Se hawwe dit dien sûnt se wie in bern.
I can easily do this work.	Ik kin maklik dwaan dit wurk.
She could not say how late it was.	Se koe net sizze hoe let it wie.
He will do very well.	Hy sil it hiel goed dwaan.
But there were problems.	Mar der wiene problemen.
Take my word for it and go away.	Nim myn wurd der foar en gie fuort.
It is up to us to find them.	It is oan ús om se te finen.
And so it goes on.	En sa giet it troch.
There was something about him, something.	Der wie wat oer him, wat.
Maybe we should talk together.	Miskien moatte wy tegearre prate.
It was so true.	It wie sa wier.
He wanted it to stop.	Hy woe dat it ophâlde.
These are you.	Dizze binne jo.
She did well with both.	Se die it goed mei beide.
It's a great idea, but we just can not afford it.	It is in moai idee, mar wy kinne it gewoan net betelje.
Go to him.	Gean nei him ta.
They like to live there.	Se wenne dêr graach.
That was what she thought.	Dat wie wat se tocht.
Not too bad.	Net al te min.
Feel nothing.	Fiel neat.
My parents too.	Myn âlden ek.
He was good at it too.	Hy wie der ek goed yn.
Be careful what you want.	Wês foarsichtich wat jo wolle.
Two would be better, but one would do.	Twa soe better wêze, mar ien soe dwaan.
But there are better things to do.	Mar d'r binne bettere dingen te dwaan.
Of course, she did not keep her word.	Fansels hat se har wurd net hâlden.
You do not eat.	Jo ite net.
Maybe they still do.	Miskien dogge se dat noch.
See her now.	Sjoch har no.
It goes on.	It giet troch.
And that's what I need.	En dat is wat ik nedich.
I think he's over it.	Ik tink dat hy der oer is.
These people have jobs.	Dizze minsken hawwe wurk.
This was not quite the same.	Dit wie net hielendal itselde.
Then look around you.	Sjoch dan om dy hinne.
At this hour no one came in or out.	Yn dit oere kaam gjinien yn of út.
These people are nice.	Dizze minsken binne aardich.
She has a large family.	Se hat in grutte famylje.
They find it here.	Se fine it hjir.
Then ask me to stay.	Freegje my dan te bliuwen.
Whatever it is.	Wat it ek is.
Of course he told me about it.	Fansels hat er my der oer ferteld.
No one will come to see them.	Nimmen sil se komme sjen.
He could be scared, but he could not believe it.	Hy koe it bang wêze, mar hy koe it net leauwe.
Of course, it worked.	Fansels, it wurke.
They stay hard.	Se bliuwe hurd.
There was nothing he could do for her.	Der wie neat dat er foar har dwaan koe.
All done very, very carefully.	Alles heul, heul foarsichtich dien.
That's where we come in.	Dêr komme wy oan.
Maybe there was really something here.	Miskien wie hjir echt wat.
But her home is never her home.	Mar har thús is nea har thús.
We would like to be, but no one is interested in us.	Wy wolle graach wêze, mar gjinien is ynteressearre yn ús.
She found a job long weekend.	Se fûn in baan lang wykein.
They are my friends.	Se binne myn freonen.
Did not work.	Wurke net.
Maybe one day it will happen.	Miskien op in dei sil it barre.
First time ever.	Earste kear ea.
He was gone now.	Hy wie no fuort.
Are you sure you want to do that?	Binne jo wis dat jo dat dwaan wolle?
She's been reading a lot lately.	Se hat de lêste tiid in protte lêzen.
From loving your home.	Fan it hâlden fan jo hûs.
You're going home.	Jo geane nei hûs.
No question about that.	Gjin fraach oer dat.
Maybe we can help each other.	Miskien kinne wy ​​elkoar helpe.
We opened the door.	Wy diene de doar iepen.
You can talk about it if you want.	Jo kinne der oer prate as jo wolle.
I can not do it.	Ik kin it net dwaan.
Your name is on the door.	Jo namme stiet op 'e doar.
Of course he saw no one.	Fansels seach er nimmen.
I thought so too.	Ik haw ek tocht.
I did not know.	Ik wist it net.
It was a long time ago that he had read it.	It wie lang lyn dat er it lêzen hie.
Let me know what you think.	Lit my witte wat jo tinke.
If he wanted to hurt her more, he just did it.	As er har mear sear dwaan woe, die er it gewoan.
I have two.	Ik ha twa.
We tried it your way.	Wy hawwe it op jo manier besocht.
But they are out there.	Mar se binne der út.
I probably shouldn’t.	Ik soe wierskynlik net moatte.
But we work the whole city.	Mar wy wurkje de hiele stêd.
She looks at me.	Se sjocht nei my.
Not much he wants here.	Net folle dat er hjir wol.
The boy looked up at him.	De jonge seach nei him op.
Unlike that of the man.	Oars as dy fan de man.
I needed both.	Ik hie beide nedich.
I love this kind of thing.	Ik hâld fan dit soarte dingen.
The children go to school.	De bern geane nei skoalle.
Come here and we'll talk.	Kom hjir en wy prate.
Whatever he had expected, it was not.	Wat er ek ferwachte hie, dat wie it net.
I was already eating.	Ik wie al oan it iten.
I'm glad he's going to be there for me.	Ik bin bliid dat er der by my wêze sil.
That was just too nice.	Dat wie gewoan te moai.
Still, she did not look at me.	Noch altyd seach se my net oan.
Do not get into trouble.	Kom net yn problemen.
Everything he said was true.	Alles wat hy sei wie wier.
Totally agree.	Hielendal mei iens.
He has a family.	Hy hat in famylje.
I would like to know more about this.	Ik soe hjir graach mear oer witte wolle.
You do not agree and that is fine.	Jo binne it net iens en dat is goed.
I think it's going to be a very good thing.	Ik tink dat it in heul goed ding sil wurde.
He told you about me.	Hy fertelde dy oer my.
What do you want to see happen.	Wat wolle jo sjen barre.
But you first.	Mar jo earst.
If only you had more money.	As jo ​​mar mear jild hiene.
I had seen it in me.	Ik hie it yn my sjoen.
I want to do that too.	Dat wol ik ek dwaan.
We can do better.	Wy kinne better.
I need to know everything.	Ik moat alles witte.
You can do so much with it.	Jo kinne der safolle mei dwaan.
And you can see through him.	En jo kinne troch him sjen.
We will never know.	Wy sille it noait witte.
And so we did.	En dat diene wy.
It just could not.	It koe gewoan net.
Well, not really.	No, eins net.
But for now, it will be you.	Mar foar no sil it jo wêze.
That is what we should have done.	Dat hiene wy ​​dwaan moatten.
I do not want to talk to him much.	Ik wol net folle mei him prate.
Then we will eat.	Dan sille wy ite.
Maybe someone else will try it.	Miskien sil immen oars it besykje.
That's probably true.	Dat is wierskynlik wier.
What happened happened.	Wat barde barde.
But he soon realized that he could not do that.	Mar hy realisearre al gau dat hy dat net kinne soe.
Wake up before they do.	Wekker wurde foardat se dogge.
It goes on and on and on.	It giet troch en troch en troch.
We put her to bed.	Wy sette har op bêd.
This is my last.	Dit is myn lêste.
Nothing, really.	Neat, echt.
He had no idea what to say.	Hy hie gjin idee wat te sizzen.
Not much, of course.	Net folle, fansels.
I had tried it myself.	Ik hie it sels besocht.
People want to help you.	Minsken wolle jo helpe.
Well, let's get real.	No, litte wy echt wurde.
Please have a good life.	Hawwe asjebleaft in goed libben.
They just do not work.	Se wurkje gewoan net.
She did not know what had happened.	Se wist net wat der bard wie.
You have to be really careful there.	Jo moatte der echt foarsichtich wêze.
But certainly not anymore.	Mar wis net mear.
If you did well, he would tell you.	As jo ​​​​goed dien hawwe, soe hy it jo fertelle.
It would probably be good.	It soe wierskynlik goed wêze.
Be carefull.	Wês foarsichtich.
Are you with us ?.	Binne jo by ús?.
And we do that year after year.	En dat dogge wy jier nei jier.
To me he will be a man.	Foar my sil hy man wêze.
But the police were there.	Mar de plysje wie der.
He does not act as if he were even a child.	Hy docht net as wie er sels in bern.
I do not want anyone to be hurt.	Ik wol net dat ien sear docht.
Let's talk.	Lit se prate.
I was as surprised as you.	Ik wie like ferrast as jo.
Your people.	Jo minsken.
I'm sure this will be a great opportunity for him.	Ik bin der wis fan dat dit foar him de grutte kâns sil lykje.
Much could be said about that.	Dêr soe in protte oer sein wurde kinne.
They know nothing, really.	Se witte neat, echt.
Do not be so surprised.	Doch net sa ferrast.
It's still here.	It is hjir noch dêr.
The guy looked angry.	De keardel seach lilk.
She was very happy.	Se wie tige bliid.
It went hard.	It gie hurd.
It becomes my place too.	It wurdt myn plak ek.
It's always nice to wake up early.	It is altyd moai om betiid wekker te wurden.
This was the right place.	Dit wie it goede plak.
I have no reason for that, but it happened.	Ik haw der gjin reden foar, mar it is bard.
No one can leave.	Nimmen kin fuort.
Let's get together.	Litte wy tegearre komme.
We are good friends.	Wy binne goede freonen.
No matter what you are afraid of, or what you are told.	Makket net út wat jo bang binne, of wat jo ferteld wurde.
He did not think so.	Hy tocht net.
But many things I do not agree with.	Mar in protte dingen binne it net mei my iens.
I love everything in its place.	Ik hâld fan alles op syn plak.
You know it now.	Jo witte it no.
That is also clear.	Dat is ek dúdlik.
What she is does not occur to her.	Wat se is komt har net op.
He's my best friend.	Hy is myn bêste freon.
Everything to talk to her about.	Alles om mei har oer te praten.
And so it must be.	En sa moat it wêze.
We have to keep it that way.	Wy moatte it sa hâlde.
They work for us.	Se wurkje foar ús.
Don't worry.	Meitsje dy gjin soargen.
It was not only he who felt something.	It wie net allinnich hy dy't wat fielde.
I found that so nice.	Ik fûn dat sa moai.
It was too early.	It wie te betiid.
He felt tired.	Hy fielde him wurch.
There was nothing of that here.	Dêr wie hjir neat fan.
You've hit it off.	Jo hawwe it rekke.
I was a cop, and a good one.	Ik wie in plysje, en in goede.
It really never gets old.	It wurdt wier nea âld.
I wanted to tell him that, for me.	Ik woe him dat sizze, foar my.
Whether or not.	Al of net.
She walked through and through.	Se rûn troch en troch.
Then it comes back.	Dan komt it werom.
It's just not that easy.	It is gewoan net sa maklik.
It's just not my thing.	It is gewoan net myn ding.
No child has them.	Gjin bern hat har.
We really do.	Wy echt dwaan.
Everything is so different now.	Alles is no sa oars.
That woman is tall.	Dy frou is lang.
There can be so many things happening to make things different.	Der kinne safolle dingen bard wêze om dingen oars te meitsjen.
We will find her.	Wy sille har fine.
Nobody saw him.	Nimmen seach him.
He told me the guy's name.	Hy fertelde my de namme fan de keardel.
We could not help it.	Wy koene it net helpe.
They would pay with their lives.	Se soene mei har libben betelje.
You need to get some of that work done.	Jo moatte wat fan dat wurk gean.
A year ago it would not have been so.	In jier lyn soe it net sa west hawwe.
They have no idea what is good and what is not.	Se hawwe gjin idee wat goed is en wat net.
You have done a good job here.	Jo hawwe hjir goed wurk dien.
They both want something that they are told they cannot.	Se wolle beide wat dat se ferteld wurde dat se net kinne.
I'll have to put it together for you.	Ik sil it foar dy yn elkoar sette moatte.
The plan is ready.	It plan is klear.
If he did, it worked.	As hy it die, wurke it.
The child can not.	It bern kin net.
I do so much for you.	Ik doch safolle foar dy.
You just can not do this kind of thing.	Jo kinne dit soarte ding gewoan net meitsje.
They do not need you.	Se hawwe dy net nedich.
He must be really scared.	Hy moat wier bang wêze.
She did not have to say anything.	Se hoegde neat te sizzen.
I've seen things.	Ik haw dingen sjoen.
To speak for me and such.	Om foar my te praten en sa.
Maybe he didn't have to be here.	Miskien hoegde er hjir net foar te wêzen.
She said nothing about how it happened.	Se sei neat oer hoe't it barde.
Am good and happy.	Bin goed en bliid.
He does it to show to his friends.	Hy docht it om te sjen oan syn freonen.
That shouldn’t be, but it is.	Dat moat net, mar sa is it.
Though she wanted him again.	Al woe se him wer.
I know that and you know that.	Ik wit dat en jo witte dat.
I'm not interested in all that.	Ik bin net ynteressearre yn dat alles.
I was scared of that.	Ik wie bang dat.
But one word from you could take it all away.	Mar ien wurd fan dy koe dat alles fuort nimme.
They want you to know how much they love you.	Se wolle dat jo witte hoefolle se fan dy hâlde.
What it is or where it is, he can not say.	Wat it is of wêr't it is, kin er net sizze.
No one.	Net ien.
But that is never the case.	Mar dat is noait sa.
Forever and ever and ever.	Foar altyd en altyd en altyd.
He had done it before, and made it work.	Hy hie it earder dien, en makke it wurk.
But you have to go.	Mar jo moatte gean.
People who were around that time.	Minsken dy't om dy tiid wiene.
I know we do.	Ik wit dat wy dogge.
Everyone has their hand out.	Elkenien hat de hân út.
There are no words here.	Der binne gjin wurden hjir.
The police knew him well.	De plysje koe him goed.
He has to do it.	Hy moat it dwaan.
His father was reading a book.	Syn heit wie in boek te lêzen.
I'm that woman.	Ik bin dy frou.
That's his job.	Dat is syn wurk.
I hope he can not get it.	Ik hoopje dat hy it net kin krije.
And with good reason.	En mei goede reden.
I had been afraid of that.	Dêr hie ik bang foar west.
I did not try to stop him.	Ik besocht him net tsjin te hâlden.
I met this man on the way home from work.	Ik moete dizze man op 'e wei nei hûs fan it wurk.
He said goodbye and just looked at me.	Hy sei goed en seach my gewoan oan.
That is not true.	Dy is net wier.
Maybe it was not him.	Miskien wie it net hy.
I'm just sick.	Ik bin gewoan siik.
I always wanted to go.	Ik ha altyd wol gean.
You have them in place.	Jo hawwe dy yn plak.
No matter how much she wanted to.	Hoe graach se ek woe.
I was as surprised as anyone else.	Ik wie like ferrast as immen oars.
It's just hard for me.	It is gewoan dreech foar my.
But they can work hard at it.	Mar se kinne der wol hurd oan wurkje.
A man of a few words.	In man fan in pear wurden.
But it was.	Mar it wie.
The police did not stop there.	De plysje bleau dêr net oan.
Everything is so different there now.	Alles is dêr no sa oars.
It was the last day of the year.	It wie de lêste dei fan it jier.
Well, we have enough money for now.	No, wy ha foar no genôch jild.
He said he would find it.	Hy sei dat er it fine soe.
You did a good job.	Do hast der goed wurk dien.
My father was old.	Myn heit wie âld.
We can not find our way home.	Wy kinne ús wei nei hûs net fine.
She needs to come up with a better idea.	Se moat mei in better idee komme.
This is of course the way to go.	Dit is fansels de wei.
But those are probably there too.	Mar dy binne der wierskynlik ek.
It's not on.	It is net oan.
But it's a good one.	Mar it is in goede.
Well, about my whole family, really.	No, oer myn hiele famylje, echt.
He would never visit the place again.	Hy soe it plak noait wer besykje.
Now the place was gone.	No wie it plak fuort.
They were for me, they might not have been for you.	Se wiene foar my, se wiene miskien net foar jo.
We both knew why.	Wy wisten beide wêrom.
There was nothing left.	Der bleau neat oer.
This is a bit of the same thing.	Dit is in bytsje fan itselde ding.
Maybe even more.	Miskien noch mear.
I want to tell you about it.	Ik wol der oer fertelle.
Of course he is not either.	Hy is fansels ek net.
This is for the kids.	Dizze is foar de bern.
They want us to be scared.	Se wolle dat wy bang binne.
I asked her what the problem was.	Ik frege har wat it probleem wie.
His worries are theirs.	Syn soargen binne har soargen.
They were happy in the city.	Se wiene bliid yn 'e stêd.
It did not feel wrong.	It fielde net ferkeard.
Let me know if it works for you too.	Lit my witte as it ek foar jo docht.
But she was angry.	Mar se wie lilk.
That's the only reason she's here.	Dat is de iennichste reden dat se hjir is.
I have both for a few years now.	Ik haw beide in pear jier no.
In an hour, this place looks different.	Oer ien oere sjocht dit plak der oars út.
Kids love him.	Bern hâlde fan him.
It is clear that this could not be so.	It is dúdlik dat dit net sa koe.
I think they should not.	Ik tink dat se net moatte.
He did not have that last year.	Dat hie er ferline jier net.
We're going back.	Werom geane wy.
She was there.	Se wie der.
You can get help much sooner than in the past.	Jo kinne folle earder help krije as yn it ferline.
This is very true.	Dit is tige wier.
I feel for her.	Ik fiel foar har.
It was a different city.	It wie in oare stêd.
There has to be a better way.	Der moat in bettere manier wêze.
Or his father.	Of syn heit.
Why, we are so happy together.	Wêrom, wy binne sa bliid tegearre.
Looks like they're actually going through it.	It liket derop dat se der eins troch geane.
The name is everything.	De namme is alles.
I can't.	Ik kin net.
We can all.	Wy kinne allegear.
We soon agreed.	Wy wiene it gau iens.
We need to have one or the other.	Wy moatte it ien of it oare hawwe.
We were angry and scared.	Wy wiene lilk en bang.
She was a woman, not a girl.	Se wie in frou, gjin famke.
I don 't think he's doing anything to hurt me.	Ik tink net dat er wat docht om my sear te meitsjen.
This is the only way.	Dit is de ienige manier.
Must be good?	Moat goed wêze?
He's going for something.	Hy giet wat oan.
And arrived early.	En kaam betiid.
It's just so, so.	It is gewoan sa, sa.
I think this is a good idea.	Ik tink dat dit in goed idee is.
I'm coming to you.	Ik kom by dy.
I have lived there ever since.	Ik haw wenne dêr sûnt.
It was what he had been doing all his life.	It wie wat er syn hiele libben dien hat.
He arrived an hour ago.	Hy kaam in oere lyn oan.
I had to have something.	Ik moast wat hawwe.
It just doesn't look right.	It liket gewoan net goed.
He never pretended to be someone he was not.	Hy die him noait foar as immen dy't er net wie.
Very well done.	Hiel goed dien.
I can not help him.	Ik kin him net helpe.
Come to my room.	Kom op myn keamer.
And it is so, so much.	En it is sa, safolle.
It was me he had a problem with.	It wie my hy hie in probleem mei.
The boy could not tell the time.	De jonge koe de tiid net sizze.
Please see.	Sjoch asjebleaft.
What is best for you and me.	Wat is it bêste foar dy en my.
Of course, it was clear.	Fansels wie it dúdlik.
Well, people do not know where to get that.	No, minsken witte net wêr't se dat krije kinne.
Even if you are not.	Sels as jo net binne.
Never thought this day would come.	Nea tocht dat dizze dei komme soe.
He never got to see anything of it.	Hy krige der noait wat fan te sjen.
You will get it wrong.	Jo sille it ferkeard krije.
I could not.	Ik koe net.
And we both knew he did not need me.	En wy wisten beide dat er my net nedich hie.
Well, sort of.	No, soarte fan.
It went in easily.	It gie maklik yn.
Same as me.	Itselde as my.
Now everyone does.	No docht elkenien.
Here is what he says.	Hjir is wat hy seit.
They want him gone and you can see it.	Se wolle him fuort en jo kinne it sjen.
It's not a good idea.	It is gjin goed idee.
He just walked away.	Hy rûn gewoan fuort.
It was nice of her.	It wie aardich fan har.
I know it too.	Ik wit it ek.
He was everything to me.	Hy wie alles foar my.
I've only seen her once.	Ik haw har mar ien kear sjoen.
He will not look at me.	Hy sil net nei my sjen.
Never wanted to see her.	Nea woe se sjen.
That was fine with her.	Dat wie goed mei har.
There's a new movie.	Der is in nije film.
I have to stop.	Ik moat ophâlde.
He has no dog.	Hy hat gjin hûn.
Please help us to continue them.	Help ús asjebleaft om har troch te gean.
It was nothing to her.	It wie har neat.
Be there with friends.	Dêr wêze mei freonen.
It is in us and around us.	It is yn ús en om ús hinne.
It will not happen.	It sil net barre.
I went back and told my husband.	Ik gie werom en fertelde myn man.
If you want, please eat.	As jo ​​​​wolle, ite asjebleaft.
Record it if you have children.	Nim it op as jo bern hawwe.
And it worried her.	En it makke har soargen.
A great one too.	In grutte ek.
But with me it is very different.	Mar by my is it hiel oars.
We are not through yet.	Wy binne noch net troch.
I've had enough.	Ik ha genôch hân.
But it did not matter now.	Mar it hoegde no net.
There's a lot to do here.	D'r is hjir in protte te dwaan.
She's a good friend.	Se is in goede freon.
There was nothing she could do to me.	Der wie neat dat se my dwaan koe.
Sa'n man.	Sa'n man.
As if she had seen something.	As hat se wat sjoen.
She is a few months old.	Se is in pear moanne âld.
She ate well.	Se iet goed.
My question is who will believe you.	Myn fraach is wa sil dy leauwe.
He was the only person who loved me.	Hy wie de ienige persoan dy't fan my hâlde.
Who did this?	Wa hat dit dien?
It just seems like my life is always like that.	It liket krekt as is myn libben altyd sa.
I'm glad no one saw that.	Ik bin bliid dat nimmen dat sjoen hat.
You must not believe me.	Jo moatte my net leauwe.
It was too easy.	Dit wie te maklik.
Even if it's hard.	Ek al is it dreech.
Take me to him.	Nim my nei him ta.
You can never be completely sure.	Jo kinne noait hielendal wis wêze.
I will pay for everything.	Ik sil foar alles betelje.
That's just.	Dat is gewoan.
It looks like there is.	It liket derop dat der is.
I really did not want to know.	Ik woe it eins net witte.
I could not tell you why.	Ik koe dy net fertelle wêrom.
Come here often?	Kom hjir faak?
We want to be tough.	Wy wolle hurd wêze.
You will not win.	Jo sille net winne.
She's better off without him.	Se is better ôf sûnder him.
This happened a lot.	Dit barde in protte.
He had his whole family with him.	Hy hie syn hiele famylje by him.
I did not think it was normal.	Ik tocht net dat it gewoan wie.
Are good things.	Binne goede dingen.
And he could be himself around her.	En hy koe himsels om har wêze.
He needs the money.	Hy hat it jild nedich.
I know him better than anyone.	Ik ken him better as immen.
You asked for.	Jo hawwe om frege.
I have you, my friend.	Ik haw dy, myn freon.
Whether or not a party.	Al of net in feest.
He's working on it.	Hy wurket der oan.
I said nothing more.	Ik sei neat mear.
This is pretty easy.	Dit is frij maklik.
For our family.	Foar ús famylje.
Not so much here, though.	Net sa folle hjir, mar.
He's not me either.	Hy is ek net.
It is not always so.	It is net altyd sa.
He had never met him.	Hy hie him nea moete.
But he does not seem to be worried.	Mar hy liket gjin soargen te wêzen.
He can even win.	Hy kin sels winne.
We are not like that here.	Wy binne hjir net sa.
I get under the bed and put it on.	Ik kom ûnder it bêd en doch it oan.
I looked around.	Ik seach om my hinne.
There was one more thing he had to do first.	Der wie noch ien ding dat er earst dwaan moast.
But you need to know.	Mar jo moatte witte.
He would have to leave.	Hy soe fuort moatte.
And we have to.	En wy moatte.
But maybe this was wrong.	Mar miskien wie dit ferkeard.
Pay close attention to these words.	Let goed op dizze wurden.
They will need a place to stay.	Se sille in plak nedich hawwe om te bliuwen.
She has no place to go.	Se hat gjin plak om te gean.
And they have.	En se hawwe.
Just go to work.	Gean mar oan it wurk.
She wants away.	Se wol fuort.
You know how this happens and why.	Jo witte hoe't dit bart en wêrom.
I would be happy.	Ik soe bliid wêze.
Nobody says a word.	Nimmen seit in wurd.
One we've seen.	Ien dy't wy sjoen hawwe.
What happens a lot.	Wat bart der in protte.
He went to work and did his job.	Hy gie oan it wurk en die syn wurk.
I met him last night.	Ik moete him fannacht.
I had never tried it before.	Ik hie it noch noait earder besocht.
I will not play you anymore.	Ik sil dy net mear spylje.
They do it in my name.	Se dogge it yn myn namme.
I wonder.	Ik freegje my ôf.
Would love to help.	Soe graach helpe.
But we can not be too careful.	Mar wy kinne net te foarsichtich wêze.
When something happens, it happens.	As der wat bart, bart it.
I'm told we need to get out of here soon.	Der wurdt my ferteld dat wy der gau út moatte.
I need to see him at once.	Ik moat him yn ien kear sjen.
Not even his mother.	Net iens syn mem.
I was too scared.	Ik wie te bang.
I liked you.	Ik mocht fan dy.
She looked nice.	Se like aardich.
I liked that.	Dat mocht ik graach.
All that has to happen.	Alles dat moat barre.
You need to stay home.	Jo moatte thús bliuwe.
But it's still not the same.	Mar it is noch altyd net itselde.
If he knows what to do, he should tell us.	As er wit wat te dwaan, moat er it ús fertelle.
We need all the help we can get.	Wy hawwe alle help nedich dy't wy kinne krije.
I'm just too tired right now.	Ik bin no krekt te wurch.
The woman.	De frou .
That you get it.	Dat jo it krije.
Think about getting a hand job.	Tink oan it krijen fan in hân baan.
More than anything, he did not want it back.	Mear as alles woe er it net werom.
It's her way of being late.	It is har manier om te let te wêzen.
I was looking forward to the party.	Ik seach út nei it feest.
She felt much better.	Se fielde har folle better.
We had it before, and we may have it again.	Wy hiene it foar, en wy kinne hawwe it wer.
He just has to leave now.	Hy moat no mar fuort.
And that must remain so.	En dat moat sa bliuwe.
Is there one way to do that?	Is der ien manier om dat te dwaan.
She had a chance.	Se hie in kâns.
That's just the way it is.	Dat is krekt sa.
I want to work with you.	Ik wol mei dy wurkje.
I'm one of those people.	Ik bin ien fan de minsken.
Probably a lot.	Wierskynlik in protte.
Not just for me, but for everyone.	Net allinnich foar my, mar foar elkenien.
So in and out.	Sa yn en út.
And he knows why.	En hy wit wêrom.
I want to see your work.	Ik wol dyn wurk sjen.
It will hurt you, but it's the truth.	It sil jo sear dwaan, mar it is de wierheid.
It does not come from nothing.	It komt net út it neat.
Today he told me why.	Hjoed hy fertelde my wêrom.
This is not likely.	Dit is net wierskynlik.
There's nothing else in it.	Der sit neat oars yn.
Maybe two or three.	Miskien twa of trije.
I do not know how she felt about it.	Ik wit net hoe't se har der oer fielde.
Not tomorrow.	Moarn se net.
I'm your wife now.	Ik bin no dyn frou.
He looked around but saw nothing.	Hy seach om him hinne mar seach neat.
She knew well.	Se wist wol.
Of course it has something to do.	Fansels hat it wat te dwaan.
I probably just didn’t think so.	Ik tocht wierskynlik net gewoan.
She was like that.	Se wie sa.
If you are good to them, they are good to you.	As jo ​​​​goed binne foar har, binne se goed foar jo.
But it's fun.	Mar it is leuk.
It can not.	It kin net.
But get what you can.	Mar krije wat jo kinne.
This will give your dad and me a chance to talk.	Dit sil jo heit en my in kâns jaan om te praten.
Well, maybe it is now.	No, miskien is it no.
But, what we do not know is why.	Mar, wat wy net witte is wêrom.
Ask him out well.	Freegje him út.
Go in and go down now.	Gean yn en gean no ôf.
It would have been easy then.	It hie dan maklik west.
We had time.	Wy hiene tiid.
She would not do what she does.	Se soe net dwaan wat se docht.
I had not seen him and here he was.	Ik hie him net sjoen en hjir wie er.
This time he would not let the child.	Dizze kear soe hy it bern net litte litte.
I think it's really good for everyone.	Ik tink dat it echt goed is foar elkenien.
It's not too late.	It is net te let.
I do not want to see this happen.	Ik wol dit net barre sjen.
I do not have time to say much more.	Ik ha gjin tiid om folle mear te sizzen.
Give him mine.	Jou him myn.
Do not believe in anything.	Net leauwe yn wat.
But both happened.	Mar beide barde.
But someone will not.	Mar immen sil net.
That probably happens a lot more than people know.	Dat bart wierskynlik folle mear as minsken witte.
And you already have one.	En jo hawwe al ien.
Well, there may be.	No, der kin wêze.
He never liked the place.	Hy hie it plak nea leuk.
No one ever does.	Nimmen ea docht.
All we can do is just do the best job we can.	Alles wat wy kinne dwaan is gewoan it bêste wurk dwaan dat wy kinne.
Tomorrow she goes one more time.	Moarn giet se noch ien kear.
You can see that.	Dat kinne jo sjen.
But they did not talk about it now.	Mar dêr hiene se it no net oer.
She soon returned.	Se kaam gau werom.
I saw this.	Ik seach dit.
Tom is sick.	Tom is siik.
That's a real problem.	Dat is in echt probleem.
It's not this thing or that thing.	It is net dit ding of dat ding.
Once a year is probably good.	Ien kear yn it jier is wierskynlik goed.
No one was talking.	Nimmen wie oan it praten.
I will not see.	Ik sil net sjen.
Nothing had happened and he had nothing on.	Der wie neat bard en hy hie neat oan.
The house of my whole kind.	It hûs fan myn hiele soarte.
Nobody did that.	Nimmen hat dat dien.
He said so much.	Hy sei safolle.
Take your time with it.	Nim dyn tiid mei it.
It was still early.	It wie noch betiid.
I know why you came.	Ik wit wêrom jo binne kommen.
And love that photo.	En hâld fan dy foto.
All these questions.	Al dizze fragen.
She's coming back soon.	Se komt gau werom.
Go watch the movie.	Gean de film sjen.
For us to remain friends.	Foar ús om freonen te bliuwen.
I can not give you a word.	Ik kin dy gjin wurd jaan.
You can not stay here!	Jo kinne hjir net bliuwe!
So tell me.	Sa fertel my.
It's my car.	It is myn auto.
Keep it that way.	Hâld it sa.
Now my dad and my husband are best friends.	No binne myn heit en myn man bêste freonen.
Neither.	Gjin fan beide.
I wondered where you were going.	Ik frege my ôf wêr't jo hinne wiene.
Wasn't hard enough.	Wie net dreech genôch.
Can we.	Kinne wy.
He could not help it, really.	Hy koe it net helpe, echt.
I know all about you few days.	Ik wit alles oer jo pear dagen.
Not that we're scared.	Net dat wy bang binne.
She knew that.	Dat wist se.
They are not easy to read.	Se binne net maklik te lêzen.
He had a father.	Hy hie in heit.
Nobody knew where.	Nimmen wist wêr.
And that's after reading it a few times.	En dat is nei it lêzen fan it in pear kear.
Look, we're almost done!	Sjoch, wy binne hast klear!
He was very busy.	Hy wie tige drok.
From door to door.	Fan doar ta doar.
I could take it.	Ik koe it nimme.
Away now with you.	Fuort no mei dy.
So careful.	Sa foarsichtich.
He had not yet turned thirty.	Hy wie noch gjin tritich wurden.
I know it was you.	Ik wit dat it jo wiene.
And one more thing.	En noch ien ding.
Would they not think otherwise?	Soene se net oars tinke?
Please ask us if you want to buy.	Freegje ús asjebleaft as jo keapje wolle.
If you want a meeting, come to me.	As jo ​​​​in gearkomste wolle, kom jo by my.
I need money.	Ik haw jild nedich.
It can not be her.	It kin har net wêze.
That time came.	Dy tiid kaam.
She will take me, and not you.	Se sil my nimme, en net jo.
Give her something to do.	Jou har wat te dwaan.
He was also not eating.	Hy wie ek net oan it iten.
Both.	De beide.
She had eaten last night.	Se hie jûn iten.
Was just under two years old.	Wie krekt ûnder twa jier âld.
I will pay you what you want.	Ik sil jo betelje wat jo wolle.
I knew what he could do and he came up with it.	Ik wist wat er koe en hy kaam der op.
The problems are not the same.	De problemen binne net itselde.
He probably does not know about you either.	Hy wit nei alle gedachten ek net oer dy.
But they would not.	Mar se soene net.
Never once.	Nea net ien kear.
These were our friends.	Dit wiene ús freonen.
But this is a first.	Mar dit is in earste.
I'm the only one who can do this.	Ik bin de iennichste dy't dit kin.
It was really too much.	It wie echt te folle.
This was the house.	Dit wie it hûs.
He wanted to be very bad there.	Hy woe dêr tige min wêze.
Same, over and over.	Deselde, oer en oer.
She does not know.	Se wit it net.
They do not have enough money to buy a home.	Se hawwe net genôch jild om in hûs te keapjen.
This is our house.	Dit is ús hûs.
There was nothing that could be done.	Der wie neat dat dien wurde koe.
There are actually many.	Der binne eins in protte.
She opened the door for me with a book in her hand.	Se die de doar foar my iepen mei in boek yn 'e hân.
It's just way, much better than anything else.	It is gewoan manier, folle better as wat oars.
To their regret, they now knew the truth.	Oan har spyt wisten se no de wierheid.
Now the time has come.	No is de tiid kommen.
I ask for water.	Ik freegje om wetter.
This movie is good for kids.	Dizze film is goed foar bern.
Come and see.	Kom en sjoch.
Let me love her.	Lit my fan har hâlde.
I can not stay.	Ik kin net bliuwe.
You have to do it.	Jo moatte it dwaan.
I'm not coming back.	Ik kom net werom.
So hard tried.	Sa hurd besocht.
But that does not say much.	Mar dat seit net folle.
We can not find either.	Wy kinne ek gjin fine.
Not so long ago they were the same.	Net sa lang lyn wiene se itselde.
You do everything now.	Jo dogge alles no.
I saw it and did not let it go.	Ik seach it en liet it net litte.
I do not want to give anything.	Ik wol neat jaan.
His father said nothing to him.	Syn heit sei neat tsjin him.
But if it was there, it would not stay.	Mar as it der wie, soe it net bliuwe.
This movie can be good.	Dizze film kin goed wêze.
So he will see it.	Sa sil er it sjen.
You wish you could talk to her.	Jo winskje dat jo mei har prate kinne.
Everything.	Alles.
I know how these things work.	Ik wit hoe't dizze dingen wurkje.
Time and time again he tried.	Kear op kear besocht er.
to you.	nei dy ta.
One beautiful, one just.	Ien moai, ien gewoan.
That was what came through.	Dat wie wat der troch kaam.
Be a mother.	In mem wêze.
No idea where you are going with this.	Gjin idee wêr't jo mei dizze hinne gean.
But what do you think ?.	Mar wat tinksto?.
She told us you were coming.	Se fertelde ús dat jo komme soene.
Your father is an old man.	Jo heit is in âld man.
Everything just works fine.	Alles wurket gewoan goed.
There are some things you can do to make things better.	D'r binne wat dingen dy't jo kinne dwaan, om dingen better te meitsjen.
I asked who it was.	Ik frege wa't it wie.
I'm seeing someone tonight.	Ik sjoch fannacht immen.
It was nice.	It wie aardich.
I liked the movie.	Ik mocht graach de film.
Never been there.	Noait dêr west.
This is not knowing the truth.	Dit is net witte de wierheid.
All for one.	Alles foar ien.
Think about how good we have been together.	Tink oan hoe goed wy tegearre west hawwe.
One thing that.	Ien ding dat.
I did really well.	Ik die echt goed.
That, my girl, so we do tomorrow.	Dat, myn famke, sa dogge wy it moarn.
Do not do it!	Doch it net!
This is a very good thing.	Dit is in hiel goed ding.
How much work would you do?	Hoefolle wurk soene jo dwaan?
The man was working on.	De man wurke oan.
I just need a little.	Ik haw mar in bytsje nedich.
We can not return.	Wy kinne net werom.
So it's been my whole life.	Sa is it myn hiele libben west.
As a family.	As in famylje.
Let me show you this.	Lit my dy dit sjen litte.
Wake up early!	Betiid wekker wurde!
He did not like the idea.	Hy koe it idee net oan.
Tom is a big boy.	Tom is in grutte jonge.
Te.	Te.
There was one other woman before her.	Der wie ien oare frou foar har.
So it is now.	Sa is it no.
I had to get home.	Ik moast thús komme.
I'm not a man anymore.	Ik bin gjin man mear.
All this he had heard before.	Dit alles hie er al earder heard.
She's had enough.	Se hat genôch hân.
Nothing of the sort had ever been seen before.	Neat fan it soarte wie ea earder sjoen.
He did not quite know what he was doing.	Hy wist net hielendal wat er die.
This is obviously not true.	Dit is fansels net wier.
We stay late on the weekends.	Wy bliuwe let yn it wykein.
But he comes back.	Mar hy komt werom.
I may not speak.	Ik mei net prate.
They would tell her husband.	Se soene har man fertelle.
But it's not just that.	Mar it is net allinnich dat.
He was here first.	Hy wie hjir earst.
But he can see you.	Mar hy kin dy sjen.
I'm all the way home.	Ik bin de hiele wei nei hûs ôf.
Now two months.	No twa moanne.
Her other hand holds you.	Har oare hân hâldt dy.
You're too late.	Do bist te let.
It only stuck with one idea.	It bleau mar by ien idee.
Met his wife.	Moete syn frou.
And it must happen soon.	En it moat gau barre.
If he stayed long enough.	As hy lang genôch bleau.
I saw this.	Ik seach dit.
He had them.	Hy hie se.
i am sorry.	it spyt my.
I love you.	Ik hâld der fan dy.
There would be time for that, she knew.	Dêr soe tiid foar wêze, wist se.
Do not do work as it goes, of course.	Gjin wurk dwaan as it giet, fansels.
We have this.	Wy hawwe dit.
I can not leave here.	Ik kin hjir net fuort.
It seemed like fun.	It like wol leuk.
I will not do that again.	Dat sil ik net wer dwaan.
We have a few hours before dinner, and he said.	Wy hawwe in pear oeren foar it iten, en hy sei.
He does not go in there.	Hy giet der net yn.
She really could.	Se koe echt.
This can be forever.	Dit kin foar altyd wêze.
Go buy today, everyone.	Gean hjoed keapje, elkenien.
None of it worked.	Gjin fan it wurke.
We can not wait until that happens.	Wy kinne net wachtsje oant dat bart.
They find nothing else.	Se fine neat oars.
I do not want to hurt him.	Ik wol him net sear dwaan.
And, had heard of it.	En, hie der fan heard.
Let this happen.	Lit dit barre.
It's true.	It is wier.
It has to do with what he is.	It hat te krijen mei wat hy is.
He will not be a problem anymore.	Hy sil gjin probleem mear wêze.
Two on one.	Twa op ien.
If you want to go, go out now.	As jo ​​gean wolle, gean no út.
She would not have come to this meeting if she had not.	Se soe net nei dizze gearkomste kommen wêze as se net wie.
I think this can help.	Ik tink dat dit kin helpe.
I would not so soon.	Ik soe sa gau net.
They may not have much to do with each other.	Se hawwe miskien net folle mei elkoar te krijen.
You are beautiful without.	Do bist moai sûnder.
That's what they said.	Dat seine se.
If you can work around them, then do so.	As jo ​​​​om har hinne kinne wurkje, doch dat dan.
You have no idea what you just did.	Jo hawwe gjin idee wat jo krekt dien hawwe.
If for some reason everything is good to go on, then go on.	As alles om ien of oare reden goed is om troch te gean, gean dan troch.
That was that.	Dat wie dat.
So does everyone.	Sa docht elkenien.
Even more than you have.	Noch mear as jo hawwe.
But again, nothing is given.	Mar dêr wurdt wer neat jûn.
Though that probably would not have worked.	Al soe dat wierskynlik net wurke hawwe.
I put it off.	Ik sette it ôf.
For other people, not for me.	Foar oare minsken, net foar my.
I know you did something about it.	Ik wit datst dêr wat fan dien hast.
I can find something else to do.	Ik kin wat oars fine om te dwaan.
He's doing it right.	Hy docht it goed.
I just want to go.	Ik wol gewoan gean.
You join the first.	Jo dogge mei oan de earste.
He wished it was.	Hy woe dat it wie.
I have to go.	Ik moat gean.
They will be here.	Se sille hjir wêze.
She was talking about him right at our place last night.	Se hie it oer him krekt by ús fannacht.
That hurt him.	Dat die him sear.
You can still be free.	Jo kinne noch frij wêze.
It is	It bist
I love being with my friends.	Ik hâld fan wêzen mei myn freonen.
Your place is with us.	Jo plak is by ús.
We'm going on.	Wy geane troch.
No one else could know that.	Nimmen oars koe dat witte.
Everyone is surprised.	Elkenien is ferrast.
Then your friends.	Dan dyn freonen.
I do not want you to think that.	Ik wol net dat jo dat tinke.
I wanted to wait for this letter to come out.	Ik woe wachtsje op dizze brief om út te kommen.
But last night he was not.	Mar fannacht wie er net.
Nobody likes him.	Nimmen liket him.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
I think they still have it.	Ik tink dat se it noch hawwe.
Is this your car?	Is dit dyn auto?
It didn't matter anymore, even for him.	It die no net mear, ek foar him.
And a house.	En in hûs.
We get people in this place.	Wy krije minsken yn dit plak.
They had the time.	Se hiene de tiid.
But essentially has the same problem.	Mar yn wêzen hat itselde probleem.
Do you have something you want to talk about?	Hawwe jo wat wêr't jo oer prate wolle?
I want your help.	Ik wol dyn help.
When you eat, eat.	As jo ​​ite, yt.
But no one had come.	Mar der wie net ien kommen.
It was the same day as the feast.	It wie deselde dei as it feest.
Go away.	Gean fuort.
Far too late.	Folle te let.
We'll be here another week.	Wy sille hjir noch in wike wêze.
My father knows the way.	Myn heit wit de wei.
I'm not sure why this is happening.	Ik bin der net wis fan wêrom dit bart.
Let's agree to disagree.	Litte wy it iens wêze om it net iens te wêzen.
A lot of things happen.	Der bart in protte dingen.
Let me try them.	Lit my har besykje.
I know what they will say.	Ik wit wat se sille sizze.
And I'm sorry.	En it spyt my.
We need to do something.	Wy moatte wat dwaan.
I'm not free yet, he thought.	Ik bin noch net frij, tocht er.
She did not want the man to come back with help.	Se woe net dat de man werom kaam mei help.
Or maybe it's not good.	Of miskien is it net goed.
I could not do much with her.	Ik koe net folle mei har dwaan.
I'm scared.	Ik bin bang.
But he is not the same.	Mar hy is net deselde.
I had a pretty good life.	Ik hie in aardich goed libben.
He can even love me.	Hy kin sels fan my hâlde.
More this time.	Mear dizze kear.
And why not.	En wêrom net.
But that was one.	Mar dat wie ien.
Never to make it up.	Nea om it op te meitsjen.
Good people do good work.	Goede minsken dogge goed wurk.
He had not said it, but he did not need it.	Hy hie it net sein, mar hy hie it net nedich.
You never talk about him.	Jo prate noait oer him.
Your friends take care of you too.	Jo freonen soargje ek foar jo.
It's really nice.	It is echt moai.
You had to be there, man.	Do moast der wêze, man.
He just could not, or he would, do anything.	Hy koe net, of hy soe wol wat dwaan.
It's his latest work.	It is syn lêste wurk.
They must.	Se moatte.
He may be angry though.	Hy kin wol lilk wêze.
Be sure to take water with you.	Wês wis dat jo wetter mei jo nimme.
Is it wrong to worry?	Is it ferkeard om soargen te meitsjen?
he wanted to ask.	hy woe freegje.
He should have been there.	Hy hie der wêze moatten.
People could see it now.	Minsken koene it no sjen.
They believe it.	Se leauwe it.
I never want to see him again.	Ik wol him noait wer sjen.
Make time for people.	Meitsje tiid foar minsken.
We find them a lot.	Wy fine se in protte.
We do not want out of this place.	Wy wolle net út dit plak.
We did much more.	Wy diene folle mear.
You better do the same.	Jo kinne better itselde dwaan.
I can do nothing else.	Ik kin neat oars.
That gave me the idea.	Dat joech my it idee.
I'm surprised, actually.	Ik bin ferrast, eins.
Nothing here for him.	Neat hjir foar him.
He had been out of town.	Hy wie de stêd út west.
You always know where it is.	Jo witte altyd wêr't it is.
I don 't even think you want help.	Ik tink net iens dat jo help wolle.
He was a very nice, very old man.	Hy wie in hiel aardich, tige âld man.
That one day everything will be really good.	Dat ien dei alles echt goed komt.
He's busy, busy, busy today.	Hy hat it drok, drok, drok hjoed.
It will not be easy.	It sil net maklik wurde.
Who will take care of his mother?	Wa sil nei syn mem soargje?
Nobody knows.	Gjinien wit.
I've been having problems here for a few days.	Ik haw hjir in pear dagen problemen mei hân.
I was happy with how it came out.	Ik wie bliid mei hoe't it kaam út.
I wondered how much it would hurt.	Ik frege my ôf hoefolle it sear dwaan soe.
They never do it again.	Se dogge it noait wer.
It has been forever.	It hat foar altyd west.
It was my first job.	It wie myn earste baan.
I just realized she was no longer there.	Ik realisearre gewoan dat se der net mear wie.
Word came around.	Wurd kaam om.
He was not a bad being.	Hy wie gjin min wêzen.
It's just me.	It bin gewoan ik.
His father would have done that.	Dat soe syn heit wol dien hawwe.
Do not know exactly why.	Wit net wêrom krekt.
Well, that did not happen.	No, dat barde net.
She was glad she had given it to her.	Se wie bliid dat se har jûn hie.
That did it.	Dat die it.
I can not leave him there.	Ik kin him dêr net litte.
And you are.	En do bist.
I do not really like her.	Ik hâld net echt fan har.
That's where it came from.	Dêr is it oan kommen.
That's what I'll be doing this weekend.	Dat sil ik dit wykein dwaan.
If you do not believe me, come along.	As jo ​​my net leauwe, kom dan mei.
See things differently.	Dingen op in oare manier sjen.
This did not really make me better.	Dit makke my net echt better.
Here she lives with a husband and two children.	Hjir wennet se mei in man en twa bern.
They love each other so much.	Se hâlde sa folle fan elkoar.
This is how it goes.	Sa giet it.
I tried one more time.	Ik besocht noch ien kear.
He is much better one on one.	Hy is folle better ien op ien.
Maybe that will also work for you.	Miskien is dat ek wat foar jo sil wurkje.
We have it where and how, now we have it when we need it.	Wy hawwe it wêr en it hoe, no hawwe wy it wannear nedich.
How are you.	Hoe is it mei dy.
Many people visit them on the weekends.	In protte minsken besykje se yn it wykein.
There was just nothing to do.	Der wie gewoan neat te dwaan.
See it here.	Sjoch it hjir.
It's coming back soon !.	It komt gau werom!.
Be them.	Wês se.
No one can really say.	Nimmen kin echt sizze.
It's just one of those things.	It is mar ien fan dy dingen.
But it was time for him to go.	Mar it wie tiid foar him om te gean.
I hope it worked.	Ik hoopje dat it wurke.
I no longer have this problem.	Ik haw dit probleem net mear.
She would do anything to get to him.	Se soe alles dwaan om by him te kommen.
That's exactly why.	Dat is krekt wêrom.
Once a week is enough.	Ien kear yn 'e wike is genôch.
All the way home.	De hiele wei nei hûs.
But that will not happen.	Mar dat sil net barre.
This is not a time to grow old.	Dit is gjin tiid om âld te wurden.
A reason to be there.	In reden om dêr te wêzen.
I asked him if he had children.	Ik frege him oft er bern hat.
You said he gave it to you.	Jo seine dat hy it jo joech.
He needed them more than ever.	Hy hie se mear nedich as ea.
You have to think about something else, or someone else.	Jo moatte tinke oer wat oars, of immen oars.
But it's pretty easy.	Mar it is frij maklik.
I have a lot to do today.	Ik haw hjoed in protte te dwaan.
She had just met the man.	Se hie de man noch mar krekt moete.
But this will not work.	Mar dit sil net wurkje.
You have to do the work for me.	Jo moatte it wurk foar my dwaan.
Are not there.	Binne der net.
I want to know too.	Ik wol it ek witte.
Her parents were out of the question.	Har âlden wiene út 'e fraach.
But they were talking about it.	Mar se hiene it der om.
Everything you want.	Alles wat jo wolle.
I wondered what she was thinking.	Ik frege my ôf wêr't se oan tocht.
Of course, it's clear.	Fansels is it dúdlik.
It is very tired.	It is hiel wurch.
Where he was was something real.	Wêr't er wie, wie wat echt.
This is mine.	Dit is fan my.
No one took it from him.	Nimmen naam it fan him ôf.
No one else can do the job.	Nimmen oars kin it wurk dwaan.
Tomorrow, first thing.	Moarn, earste ding.
I was life.	Ik wie it libben.
Nothing came out.	Der kaam neat út.
I wanted to be with her, but mom did not let me.	Ik woe mei har, mar mem liet my net.
What food does your family eat?	Hokker iten yt dyn famylje?
Do not even ask!	Net iens freegje!
I'll put it here.	Ik sil it hjir sette.
I had never seen him like this before.	Ik hie him noch noait sa sjoen.
That's the job.	Dat is it wurk.
She never has a bad thing to say about anyone.	Se hat nea in min ding te sizzen oer immen.
I will take care of everything.	Ik sil foar alles soargje.
Let's just talk.	Lit ús mar prate.
There was something else in him now, she did not know what.	Der siet no ek wat oars yn him, se wist net wat.
It is, and it is not.	It is, en it is net.
It's coming, he thought, it's coming.	It komt wol, tocht er, it komt wol.
There was nothing here for him to do.	Der wie hjir neat foar him te dwaan.
That says itself.	Dat seit himsels.
No one else has the same thoughts as the person.	Nimmen oars hat deselde gedachten as de persoan.
Make each other.	Meitsje elkoar.
That he should not say.	Dat moat er net sizze.
She looked at her father.	Se seach har heit oan.
Now tell me.	No fertel my.
We were not alone.	Wy wiene net allinnich.
It would not have been the first time.	It soe net de earste kear west hawwe.
She had no one else.	Se hie gjinien oars.
That's nice to say.	Dat is moai om te sizzen.
Well, come with me.	No, kom mei my.
I still remember how we were.	Ik wit noch hoe't wy wiene.
You will not see him again.	Jo sille him net wer sjen.
And he came.	En hy kaam.
We do not have that here.	Dat hawwe wy hjir net.
He had never spoken like that before.	Hy hie noch noait sa praat.
It would be his job.	It soe syn wurk wêze.
That does it almost exactly.	Dat docht it hast krekt.
To do that, she had to eat.	Om dat te dwaan moast se ite.
He and I.	Hy en ik.
Take enough of it.	Nim der genôch fan.
He would not have thought of that.	Dêr soe er net oan tocht hawwe.
I opened it.	Ik die iepen.
I just want a better life for him.	Ik wol gewoan in better libben foar him.
And they stick to what they know.	En se hâlde har wol oan wêr't se witte.
Now they are in our big time.	No binne se yn ús grutte tiid.
There is no question about it.	Der is gjin fraach oer.
They knew why.	Se wisten wêrom.
I love being a girl.	Ik hâld fan in famke te wêzen.
The people look like people.	De minsken lykje op minsken.
I had to work for it.	Ik moast der foar wurkje.
What you have but do not have.	Wat jo hawwe, mar net hawwe.
That's not bad.	Dat giet net min.
It seems easy, but it is not.	It liket maklik, mar it is net.
It speaks for itself.	It seit himsels.
One day she came to me.	Op in dei kaam se nei my ta.
Maybe he's not there.	Miskien is er der net.
Here it is again.	Hjir is it wer.
A lot of people are now.	In protte minsken binne no.
To talk about it.	Om der oer te praten.
No one was free in the past and no one is free now.	Nimmen wie yn it ferline frij en nimmen is no frij.
We have become good friends.	Wy binne goede freonen wurden.
She's coming soon enough.	Se komt gau genôch.
My parents are very well off.	Myn âlden binne hiel goed ôf.
It can not be more than what it seems.	It kin net mear wêze as wat it liket.
She seemed happy.	Se like bliid.
Fine in man.	Fine in man.
I want to know how to make one.	Ik wol wol witte hoe't ik ien meitsje.
I had never been to one before.	Ik hie noch noait earder by ien west.
That's all.	Dat alles.
She will be here.	Se sil hjir wêze.
Or maybe that was not at all.	Of miskien wie dat hielendal net.
I would have done anything for her.	Ik soe alles foar har dien hawwe.
Not from there anymore.	Dêr net mear fan.
But you could do it.	Mar do koe it dwaan.
I have friends with money.	Ik haw freonen mei jild.
Look good.	Sjoch goed.
You've been good to me.	Do bist goed foar my west.
We have no people.	Wy hawwe gjin minsken.
Now he wants to make a movie.	No wol er in film meitsje.
It does not,.	It makket gjin,.
What she found.	Wat se fûn.
It was not good.	It wie net goed.
If he could tell her who he was.	As er har fertelle koe wa't er wie.
Clearly she had not said much about me to him.	Dúdlik hie se net folle oer my tsjin him sein.
And it happened.	En it barde.
Faith is easy.	Leauwe binne maklik.
The kind you might be scared of.	It soarte dat jo bang kinne.
Try it before it goes bad.	Besykje it foardat it min giet.
Let's eat here tonight.	Litte wy hjir fannacht ite.
That's never the case.	Dat is noait sa.
There is a good reason for that.	Der is in goede reden foar.
Now his work.	No syn wurk.
Has me a little worried actually.	Hat my in bytsje soargen eins.
I do not know how it happened.	Ik wit net hoe't it bard is.
That, you know, there's that.	Dat, jo witte, dêr is dat.
I do not know what to say to you.	Ik wit net wat ik dy sizze moat.
To put it simply, it's too much.	Om it gewoan te sizzen, it is te folle.
You have a plan.	Jo hawwe in plan.
Her mother found out and told the girl to stop watching me.	Har mem fûn út en fertelde it famke om op te hâlden mei my te sjen.
And that just will not happen.	En dat sil gewoan net barre.
We have to be very careful with the money.	Wy moatte tige foarsichtich wêze mei it jild.
Nobody knows where you are.	Nimmen wit wêr't jo binne.
We know better.	Wy witte better.
Without it he does not want to leave.	Sûnder wol er net fuort.
I'm not leaving.	Ik gean net fuort.
But they would see.	Mar se soene sjen.
I knew it was coming.	Ik wist dat it komme soe.
But that was just not him.	Mar dat wie him gewoan net.
I was there.	Ik wie dêr.
That would be nice.	Dat soe moai wêze.
They can do whatever they want.	Se kinne dwaan wat se wolle.
Or the past.	Of it ferline.
It's wrong.	It is ferkeard.
Not by my family and not by my husband.	Net troch myn famylje en net troch myn man.
But these people really have no say.	Mar dizze minsken hawwe echt gjin sizzen.
Remember me please.	Tink my asjebleaft.
Let me know if there are any issues with the question.	Lit my witte as d'r problemen binne mei de fraach.
He was not good either.	Hy wie ek net goed.
Did not work for two years.	Twa jier net wurke.
He is for you.	Hy is foar dy.
We pay.	Wy betelje.
I do not like it.	Ik hâld der net fan.
And it was beautiful.	En it wie moai.
They can tell you.	Se kinne jo fertelle.
That's it.	Dat is it.
They love him.	Se hâlde fan him.
A very good one.	In hiel goede ien.
We'll see it through.	Wy sille it troch sjen.
Whatever her mother thought of him, she wanted him.	Wat har mem ek fan him tocht, se woe him.
His or her, it did not matter.	Syn of har, it makke neat út.
I will say no more.	Ik sil net mear sizze.
He hurt himself so much that he was not so happy.	Hy die himsels sear, dat hy wie net sa bliid.
I wish we had the time.	Ik winskje dat wy de tiid hiene.
Food is bad there now.	Iten is dêr no min.
He knew what he was going to do.	Hy wist wat er dwaan soe.
I hope not either.	Ik hoopje ek net.
No one can help me.	Nimmen kin my helpe.
But if you have to go, then you have to.	Mar as jo gean moatte, dan moatte jo.
There was so little needed for that, it seemed to him.	Dêr wie sa'n bytsje foar nedich, like him ta.
I could not ask my mother.	Ik koe myn mem net freegje.
Maybe that will happen this year.	Miskien bart dat dit jier.
Take a large bowl.	Nim in grutte kom.
That never happens.	Dat bart noait.
He is himself again.	Hy is wer himsels.
But, we did.	Mar, wy diene.
She had to be told.	Se moast ferteld wurde.
I know it's easy for me to say, but do not worry.	Ik wit dat it maklik foar my is om te sizzen, mar meitsje jo gjin soargen.
Let me think.	Lit my tinke.
I was seen.	Ik waard sjoen.
We need to find them.	Wy moatte se fine.
She dropped his name.	Se liet syn namme ôf.
It must stop.	It moat ophâlde.
All these things and more.	Al dizze dingen en mear.
The child quickly went to the door.	It bern gie gau nei de doar.
They are together forever.	Se binne foar altyd tegearre.
Only two of the three.	Allinnich twa fan de trije.
Or someone came along and found out.	Of der kaam ien en wist it út.
There was not one more, there were more than one.	Der wie net ien mear, der wiene mear as ien.
She did not see it.	Se seach it net.
I'm just wondering why.	Ik freegje my gewoan de reden fan dat ôf.
If he had, he would have done so sooner.	As hy wie, hie er dat earder dien.
Of many things.	Fan in protte dingen.
He has his plan.	Hy hat syn plan.
She never asked how it was with him.	Se hat noait frege hoe't it mei him wie.
My family looked out for me.	Myn famylje seach út foar my.
He can be anything.	Hy kin alles wêze.
I'm just trying to do my thing.	Ik besykje gewoan myn ding te dwaan.
And there was never anything left.	En der wie noait wat oer.
I wish it was me.	Ik woe dat it my wie.
That is so so true.	Dat is sa sa wier.
Please someone help me.	Asjebleaft ien help my.
The other three do work.	De oare trije dogge wurk.
Everyone tried to get there.	Elkenien besocht der te kommen.
They told you not to come yet.	Se seine dy noch net komme.
This may be my chance.	Dit kin myn kâns wêze.
You can not leave.	Jo kinne net fuort.
That was one thing.	Dat wie ien ding.
And they will not know it.	En se sille it net witte.
But nothing else.	Mar neat oars.
Next week they can find another girl.	Takom wike kinne se noch in famke fine.
They say it does him no good.	Se sizze dat it him net goed docht.
You could not do that.	Dat koene jo net.
That which is clear.	Dat wat dúdlik is.
She would pay for it.	Se soe it betelje.
Somehow the man has to leave.	Op ien of oare manier moat de man fuort.
He had no idea how.	Hy hie gjin idee hoe.
Well, before it's too late.	No, foardat it te let is.
But there is more, much more.	Mar der is mear, folle mear.
They get things told.	Se krije dingen ferteld.
He did not hesitate.	Hy hoegde net.
Well, that interested me.	No, dat ynteressearre my.
I do not feel well.	Ik fiel my net goed.
But you have to get to work.	Mar jo moatte oan it wurk sette.
So pretty!.	Sa moai!.
He said not a word.	Hy sei gjin wurd.
I saw things that could never be.	Ik seach dingen dy't noait koe wêze.
You have to see for yourself.	Jo moatte sels sjen.
I had never heard such a thing.	Ik hie noch noait sa'n ding heard.
They are good at that.	Dêr binne se goed yn.
I made this myself.	Ik makke dit sels.
Nobody really wanted to ask either.	Nimmen woe eins ek freegje.
You can find it for me.	Jo kinne it foar my fine.
I do not think it will ever happen.	Ik tink net dat it oait barre sil.
But they have two other problems.	Mar se hawwe twa oare problemen.
We are here.	Wy binne hjir.
I can not go against both.	Ik kin net tsjin beide gean.
We are not talking again.	Wy prate net wer.
And they are good at that job.	En se binne goed yn dat wurk.
I liked that.	Dat fûn ik wol aardich.
The boy ran only for her.	De jonge rûn allinnich foar har.
Look, these were you.	Sjoch mar, dit wiene jo.
This was real.	Dit wie echt.
Come on, have something.	Kom op, ha wat.
He sat there for a long time.	Hy siet dêr lang.
I did not want it to stop.	Ik woe net dat it ophâlde.
And not enough.	En net genôch.
Do not look so worried.	Sjoch net sa soargen.
I looked away, surprised and angry.	Ik seach fuort, ferrast en lilk.
It must be done well.	It moat goed dien wurde.
Have done.	Haw dien.
We do not want to, but we will.	Wy wolle net, mar wy sille.
Look out!	Sjoch út!
Well, we'll see.	No, wy sille sjen.
But those have just become.	Mar dat binne gewoan wurden.
Take the weekend off.	Nim it wykein frij.
Those questions would have to wait.	Dy fragen soene wachtsje moatte.
And not only that.	En net allinnich dit.
I think he's it for me.	Ik tink dat hy it foar my is.
Neither has money.	Gjin fan beide hat jild.
Even we know many things that will happen.	Sels wy witte in protte dingen dy't sille barre.
He does not have to.	Hy hoecht net.
Check it out if you want.	Sjoch it op as jo wolle.
He arrived late for the party.	Hy kaam te let foar it feest.
I wanted so badly.	Ik woe sa graach.
You're too late.	Do bist te let.
And wants to know why.	En wol witte wêrom.
But he seems to like it.	Mar hy liket it wol leuk te hawwen.
Do not take things that are not yours.	Nim net dingen dy't net fan jo binne.
We haven't done much since.	Wy hawwe sûnt net folle dien.
They have to do everything for him.	Se moatte alles foar him dwaan.
Everything he did was for her.	Alles wat hy die wie foar har.
There came one, and he could scare the man.	Der kaam ien, en hy koe de man bang meitsje.
The man knew nothing.	De man wist neat.
For me, that says a lot.	Foar my seit dat in protte.
I just will not.	Ik sil gewoan net.
But you know what people are like.	Mar jo witte hoe't minsken binne.
He had not thought of that.	Dêr hie er net oan tocht.
It's just that we do not.	It is gewoan dat wy net dogge.
I had no idea what my father was planning.	Ik hie gjin idee wat myn heit fan plan wie.
Whatever you want.	Wat jo mar wolle.
They are forever.	Se binne foar altyd.
It was just things that happened.	It wiene gewoan dingen dy't barde.
It does not matter which.	It makket neat út hokker.
I knew this could not be an opportunity.	Ik wist wol dat dit gjin kâns wêze koe.
He must.	Hy moat.
But it was too late for that.	Mar dêr wie it te let foar.
Look at my mother.	Sjoch nei myn mem.
Has ever done it.	Hat it ea dien.
I still have a picture of it.	Dêr haw ik noch in foto fan.
I have no money now.	Ik haw no gjin jild.
She knew he was there without looking.	Se wist dat er der wie sûnder te sjen.
Now it's over to him again.	No giet it him wer oer.
No other car was seen.	Gjin oare auto wie te sjen.
Everyone here does.	Elkenien hjir docht.
But you have to get ready for it.	Mar jo moatte jo der foar klear meitsje.
There was only one other chance.	Der wie mar ien oare kâns.
I do not want to hurt him.	Ik wol him net sear dwaan.
The next question.	De folgjende fraach.
Be a good man.	Wês in goede man.
Of course, this is not the only issue.	Dêr giet it fansels net allinnich om.

I've never seen her before.	Ik haw har noch noait earder sjoen.
Look at me, mother.	Sjoch my, mem.
And it really is.	En it is echt.
It's getting better.	It wurdt better.
A young man left home that day.	In jonge man gie dy dei fan hûs.

That's nice.	Dat is it moai.
She was beautiful.	Se wie moai.

Look at the picture.	Sjoch nei de foto.
Friend to friend.	Freon tsjin freon.
I do not know which.	Ik wit net hokker.

Now they can not.	No kinne se net.

That's not what it's about.	Dêr giet it net om.
We'll both still be there.	Wy sille der beide noch by wêze.
He told her he could not stay.	Hy fertelde har dat er net bliuwe koe.
You did not ask to be here.	Jo hawwe net frege om hjir te wêzen.
You tell them.	Jo fertelle se.
I know this is a bad time.	Ik wit dat dit in minne tiid is.
But maybe it was true.	Mar miskien wie it wier.
I see it myself today.	Ik sjoch it sels hjoed.
That we could only go home.	Dat wy mar nei hûs koene.
But it would soon be over.	Mar it soe gau oer wêze.
It's just what we do.	It is gewoan wat wy dogge.
Give us your word.	Jou ús dyn wurd.
We need to be angry at each other.	Wy moatte lilk wêze op elkoar.
Whatever they do, it works.	Wat se ek dogge, it wurket.

Once out they could not get back in.	Ien kear út koene se net wer yn.
You will do nothing.	Jo sille neat dwaan.
Does this have any water?	Hat dit wat wetter?
It was the first time he really thought about it.	It wie de earste kear dat er der echt oan tocht.
No one knows where she is.	Nimmen wit wêr't se is.
But then you have a whole life left.	Mar dan ha jo in hiele libben oer.
He must be worried sick.	Hy moat soargen siik wêze.
But she told me the same thing again today.	Mar se fertelde my hjoed wer itselde.
He took it home.	Hy naam it mei nei hûs.
Think of what is good.	Tink oan wat is goed.
Well, a room.	No, in keamer.
That he did what he had to do.	Dat hy die wat er dwaan moast.
But these days.	Mar dizze dagen.
He was glad he had.	Hy wie bliid dat er hie.
We decided to stay for now.	Wy besletten foar no te bliuwen.
You're on time.	Do bist op tiid.
Could not see her now.	Koe har no net sjen.
That happens after all.	Dat bart nei alle gedachten.
He had not thought of that.	Dêr hie er net oan tocht.
Does not.	Sil net.
I'll show you how to do this.	Ik sil jo sjen litte hoe't jo dit dwaan.
It seemed like they were living with him.	It like dat se oan him wenne.
There are only three words.	It binne mar trije wurden.
Here's the problem with that.	Hjir is it probleem mei dat.
I saw it away.	Ik seach it fuort.
This had always been his problem.	Dit hie altyd syn probleem west.
Previously, it was like a bad movie.	Earder wie it as in minne film.
And he could.	En hy koe.
We make up.	Wy meitsje op.
He's coming back in a bit.	Hy komt oer in bytsje werom.
It's obviously not a good idea.	It is fansels gjin goed idee.
This is different.	Dizze is oars.
You should try to get more out of it.	Jo moatte besykje mear út te kommen.
I knew nothing of her sick.	Ik wist neat fan har siik.
That is clearly not true.	Dat is dúdlik gjin wierheid.
Two problems, actually.	Twa problemen, eins.
What makes us better is also different.	Wat ús better makket, is ek oars.
But that's not for me.	Mar dat is net foar my.
At one point we did.	Op in kear diene wy.
We are there in no time.	Wy binne der yn gjin tiid.
It never comes back, it never happens again.	It komt noait werom, it bart noait wer.
He's going there anyway.	Hy giet der wol hinne.
I think this makes me a little late.	Ik tink dat dit my in bytsje let makket.
I had never seen them like this before.	Ik hie se noch noait sa sjoen.
I know my class has done.	Ik wit dat myn klasse dien hat.
It's the last thing you need.	It is it lêste wat jo nedich hawwe.
Somehow that seemed good to me.	Op ien of oare manier like dat goed foar my.
She had to get ready.	Se moast har klear meitsje.
But they love each other.	Mar se hâlde fan elkoar.
Of his life there she did not know much.	Fan syn libben dêr wist se net folle.
Do not make this about me.	Meitsje dit net oer my.
That's pretty good.	Dat is moai goed.
But do not give up.	Mar jou net op.
That was always a problem for him.	Dat wie altyd in probleem foar him.
Show them in my office.	Lit se yn myn kantoar sjen.
This has been fun.	Dit hat west leuk.
We want to know what would happen if they were together.	Wy wolle witte wat der barre soe as se tegearre wiene.
Should not be a problem for you.	Moat gjin probleem wêze foar jo.
We make it do.	Wy meitsje it dwaan.
That I can say.	Dat kin ik sizze.
Really, look it up.	Echt, sjoch it op.
There was also something else at work.	Der wie ek wat oars oan it wurk.
I can do another one like that.	Ik kin noch ien sa dwaan.
It should but it is not.	It soe moatte mar it is net.
She was not even family.	Se wie net iens famylje.
His car has seen better days.	Syn auto hat bettere dagen sjoen.
She was scared.	Se wie bang.
I remember my mother.	Ik tink oan myn mem.
She's fine.	It giet goed mei har.
It's going to stay open, girl.	It sil iepen bliuwe, famke.
It's very.	It is tige.
You do not know how.	Jo witte net hoe.
I think we should play it.	Ik tink dat wy moatte spylje it.
And she's so tired.	En se is sa wurch.
I did what was asked of me.	Ik die wat fan my frege waard.
It was like.	It wie as.
And his last.	En syn lêste.
He found me last year.	Hy fûn my ferline jier.
All right, he said.	Goed, sei er.
It should not be too difficult.	It soe net te dreech wêze moatte.
I have him now.	Ik haw him no.
I can not say enough good things about it.	Ik kin der net genôch goede dingen oer sizze.
It's time for him to talk.	It is tiid foar him om te praten.
As good as can be.	Sa goed as kin wêze.
We had not thought of that.	Dêr hiene wy ​​net oan tocht.
She gave in a little.	Se joech in bytsje yn.
We love that they were not.	Wy hâlde dat se net wiene.
Which was not much more than nothing.	Wat wie net folle mear as neat.
But no one else can do it.	Mar nimmen oars kin it dwaan.
It could happen tomorrow.	It kin moarn barre.
I wondered how long he had been waiting for us.	Ik frege my ôf hoe lang er op ús wachte hie.
But not anymore.	Mar net mear.
It was necessary.	It wie nedich.
But this went on.	Mar dit gie troch.
They are no longer afraid of me.	Se binne net mear bang foar my.
What could be more?	Wat kin der noch mear wêze?
Have no one.	Haw gjin ien.
Can't get in there.	Kin der net yn.
I feel really good.	Ik fiel my echt goed.
What is wrong.	Wat is ferkeard.
There is.	Dêr is.
Next month.	De folgjende moanne.
Must take that chance.	Moatte dy kâns nimme.
Keep away from this animal.	Hâld fuort fan dit bist.
Next best thing.	Folgjende bêste ding.
You will do this now.	Jo sille dit no dwaan.
See for yourself.	Sjoch it sels.
But it was still hard.	Mar it wie noch hurd.
I want to know what people are saying.	Ik wol witte wat minsken sizze.
I was so ready.	Ik wie sa klear.
I know the way.	Ik wit de wei.
But no one will.	Mar gjinien sil.
We take care of the children a lot.	Wy soargje foar de bern in protte.
He loves this.	Hy hâldt fan dit.
That this was different.	Dat dit oars wie.
Well, you find out.	No, jo fine it út.
Go see for yourself.	Gean sels sjen.
He told me he would take care of it.	Hy fertelde my dat hy der foar soargje soe.
This house felt that way.	Dit hûs fielde sa.
I hope to see you soon.	Ik hoopje dy gau te sjen.
He did not wait long.	Hy wachte net lang.
If he was here, he could tell us in words.	As hy hjir wie, koe hy ús yn wurden fertelle.
It was not that easy.	Sa maklik wie it net.
The same thing happened to another woman.	Itselde barde mei in oare frou.
Everyone knows that.	Elkenien wit dat.
They want to be a family.	Se wolle in famylje wêze.
I would not take it.	Ik soe it net nimme.
I really like the idea.	Ik hâld echt fan it idee.
She never did.	Se hat nea dien.
he said.	hy sei.
I do not think it's something to worry about.	Ik tink net dat it wat om soargen te meitsjen.
It makes us.	It makket ús.
That's good for me.	Dat is goed foar my.
They can not do everything.	Se kinne net alles dwaan.
But you can not come with us.	Mar jo kinne net mei ús komme.
We never talked about it again.	Wy ha der noait wer oer praat.
She has worked hard all her life.	Se hat har hiele libben hurd wurke.
Please keep a few things in mind.	Hâld asjebleaft in pear dingen yn gedachten.
Three were bad, one was good.	Trije wiene min, ien wie goed.
Just tell us when and where and we'll be there.	Fertel ús gewoan wannear en wêr en wy sille der wêze.
Not many did it.	Net folle diene it.
In a big way.	Op in grutte manier.
She never liked this teacher.	Se hat dizze learaar noait leuk.
It would wait, she thought.	It soe wachtsje, tocht se.
He wants what he can not have.	Hy wol wat er net hawwe kin.
I was angry at her.	Ik wie lilk op har.
I told the truth.	Ik fertelde de wierheid.
You need to have something now.	Jo moatte no wat hawwe.
My parents worry about me.	Myn âlden meitsje har soargen oer my.
He did not have much time.	Hy hie net folle tiid.
This way, not that.	Dizze manier, net dat.
I did not see this.	Ik seach dit net.
Or whatever that was.	Of wat dat ek wie.
Don't leave me.	Gean net by my wei.
And then another, and another.	En dan noch ien, en noch ien.
I was sure of it.	Ik wie der wis fan.
To come or go to.	Om te kommen of gean nei.
He became angry again.	Hy waard wer lilk.
A teacher stands for the class.	In learaar stiet foar de klasse.
This would never work.	Dit soe nea wurkje.
That was not my home.	Dat wie myn thús net.
You have to get out of there.	Jo moatte der út.
She has done a good job.	Se hat goed wurk dien.
I was like, really.	Ik wie as, echt.
I'm here to see my dad.	Ik bin hjir om myn heit te sjen.
All our lives.	Al ús libben.
And it's pretty good.	En it is aardich goed.
I know it happened somehow.	Ik wit dat it op ien of oare manier bard is.
Do not talk to her!	Praat net mei har!
All in all, of course.	Alles hielendal, fansels.
I worked my way through.	Ik wurke my troch.
She just did not know what she was doing.	Se wist net wat se die.
So much has happened since then.	Der is sûnt dy tiid safolle bard.
Also worked well.	Wurke ek goed.
I am a very good person.	Ik bin in hiel goed persoan.
That is no longer true.	Dat is net mear wier.
This does not work.	Dit wurket net.
I see no way around it.	Ik sjoch dêr gjin manier om hinne.
But this we just can not do.	Mar dit kinne wy ​​gewoan net dwaan.
Very bad.	Hiel min.
I was ready to.	Ik wie ree om.
We are man and woman.	Wy binne man en frou.
Many times.	Faak.
He did not want us to worry.	Hy woe net dat wy ús soargen meitsje.
But after a bit of running around in the morning, it got better.	Mar nei in bytsje rûn fan 'e moarn waard it better.
That's what I just told her.	Dat haw ik har krekt ferteld.
They just want you to do it right.	Se wolle gewoan dat jo it goed dogge.
Is there a way to get that out.	Is der in manier om dat út te krijen.
What if there was no money?	Wat as der gjin jild wie?
We really do not want more.	Wy wolle eins net mear.
He does work that few people do.	Hy docht wurk dat in pear minsken dogge.
She looked surprised to see me.	Se seach ferrast om my te sjen.
He was in the here and now.	Hy wie yn it hjir en no.
We can leave.	Wy kinne fuort.
Not the way to go.	Net de manier om te gean.
I have to go now.	Ik moat no gean.
What time did she leave home?	Hoe let gie se út hûs?
He did not have to do it.	Hy hoegde him net te dwaan.
This is the last question.	Dit is de lêste fraach.
When we are ready.	As wy klear binne.
And today it did.	En hjoed die it.
His concern was an open thing.	Syn soargen wie in iepen ding.
But they did and we are here.	Mar se diene en wy binne hjir.
This will not help people.	Dit sil minsken net helpe.
We were still.	Wy wiene noch.
They will know you were here.	Se sille witte dat jo hjir wiene.
That will be nice.	Dat sil moai wêze.
You have to be ready for that.	Dêr moatte jo op ree wêze.
Were not sure if she ever had.	Wiene net wis oft se oait hie.
This day had been too much for her.	Dizze dei hie har te folle west.
It could be done.	It koe dien wurde.
She knew she had no worries.	Se wist dat se gjin soargen hie.
Nobody said much.	Nimmen sei folle.
You do not want to do this.	Jo wolle dit net dwaan.
He really felt that they were true.	Hy fielde echt dat se wier wiene.
It like.	It like.
The food must be bought well.	It iten moat goed kocht wurde.
This is not enough.	Dit is net genôch.
Will this work ?.	Sil dit wurkje?.
He had to be from.	Hy moast fan wêze.
It was from his mother, he said.	It wie fan syn mem, sei er.
It is clear that she expected this question.	It is dúdlik dat se dizze fraach ferwachte.
I received a letter from her.	Ik krige in brief fan har.
Enter him and you are ready.	Jou him oan en do bist klear.
No one knows who they are, or what they do.	Nimmen wit wa't se binne, of wat se dogge.
Just like here.	Krekt sa hjir.
He said sure.	Hy sei wis.
Maybe you could not.	Miskien koene jo net.
They were long.	Se wiene lang.
I did not eat it.	Ik ha it net iet.
Then we come to questions.	Dan komme wy by fragen.
One of us, now.	Ien fan ús, no.
It was nothing of the sort.	It wie neat fan it soarte.
He had to get out of here.	Hy moast hjir wei.
But tell you something.	Mar fertel dy wat.
He just looked.	Hy seach gewoan.
She said nothing.	Se sei neat.
I think this would help her a lot.	Ik tink dat dit har in protte soe helpe.
These things do happen.	Dizze dingen barre wol.
The work will not hurt you.	It wurk sil jo gjin sear dwaan.
We would do the same.	Wy soene itselde dwaan.
Here it came.	Hjir kaam it.
That hurt a lot!	Dat die in protte sear!
I just let him go.	Ik liet him der mar oan.
This is me!	Dit bin ik!
I do not know where we got that from.	Ik wit net wêr't wy dat wei hawwe.
Would stay there again.	Soe bliuwe dêr wer.
But there are many things that should not happen.	Mar der bart in protte dingen dy't net moatte barre.
Everyone should help us.	Elkenien moat ús helpe.
It was not fun.	It wie net leuk.
This one had.	Dizze hie.
It's the best.	It is de bêste.
The week will be good for many.	De wike sil goed wêze foar in protte.
She came home from school too late.	Se kaam te let werom fan skoalle.
We did not know him.	Wy koene him net oan.
Here was my chance to make myself at home.	Hjir wie myn kâns om my thús te meitsjen.
Better without it.	Better sûnder it.
It's about everything.	It giet om alles.
There must be something in the water.	Der moat wat yn it wetter wêze.
That it was time.	Dat it tiid wie.
And you know it too.	En jo witte it ek.
That's right.	Dat is krekt.
Okay, we'll try it your way.	Goed, wy sille it op jo manier besykje.
But you've heard it here.	Mar jo hawwe it hjir heard.
He is nothing to me.	Hy is neat foar my.
Coming and going was not easy.	Kom en gean wie net maklik.
I know it's hard, but it's what we need to do.	Ik wit dat it dreech is, mar it is wat wy moatte dwaan.
Far too late.	Folle te let.
This is no different.	Dizze is net oars.
The problem was how.	It probleem wie hoe.
Not both of us.	Net beide fan ús.
We'll try it.	Wy sille it besykje.
Never pay more than this.	Nea betelje mear as dit.
In the water, it is.	Yn it wetter, it is.
What needs to be done?	Wat moat der dien wurde?
First, they were together.	Earst wiene se tegearre.
These were also unreadable.	Dy wiene ek net te lêzen.
Had to help.	Moast helpe.
You will not stay.	Jo sille net bliuwe.
It's still here.	It is hjir noch.
I looked at everything.	Ik seach nei alles.
They are food.	Se binne iten.
This is very necessary.	Dit is tige nedich.
Here was a lot of old money.	Hjir wie in protte âld jild.
Well, of course it will.	No, fansels sil it wol.
But it was only the door of another room.	Mar it wie allinnich de doar fan in oare keamer.
Hope you get better soon.	Hoopje dat jo gau better wurde.
They do not know what it is.	Se witte net wat it is.
To this day of course.	Oant hjoed fansels.
He looked back at her.	Hy seach nei har werom.
But that all is nothing.	Mar dat alles neat is.
He knew, and he let them do it.	Hy wist, en hy liet se it dwaan.
I had to go.	Ik moast gean.
She worked with other people he had never met.	Se wurke mei oare minsken dy't er nea moete.
But she could do with the money.	Mar se koe dwaan mei it jild.
But stick with me.	Mar hâld mei my.
There is a reason.	Der is in reden.
Tell him what you like best.	Fertel him wat jo it bêste fine.
He's really angry.	Hy is echt lilk.
You need to get this right.	Jo moatte dit krekt krije.
She will find us, do not worry.	Se sil ús fine, meitsje jo gjin soargen.
Really, really bad.	Echt, echt min.
The more you do it, the better you get at it.	Hoe mear jo it dogge, hoe better jo it krije.
He lived with his mother.	Hy wenne by syn mem.
She knows me too well.	Se ken my te goed.
And he's still with me.	En hy is noch by my.
We do not need more there.	Mear hawwe wy dêr net nedich.
That was more than a month ago.	Dat wie mear as in moanne lyn.
Today she did what she had never done before.	Hjoed die se wat se noch noait earder dien hie.
I was really worried about that.	Ik makke my dêr eins echt soargen oer.
Have you heard anything about him?	Hawwe jo wat oer him heard?
I was very angry.	Ik wie in protte lilk.
Not where you worry.	Net wêr't jo soargen meitsje.

I love what it stands for.	Ik hâld fan wêr't it foar stiet.
I hope you are well.	Ik hoopje dat jo goed binne.
He was sure she was waiting for that and that was fine.	Hy wie der wis fan dat se der op wachte en dat wie goed.
People need to get on with it.	Der moatte minsken op.
I can not do it.	Ik kin it net dwaan.
Evening was fun though.	Jûn wie wol leuk.
Nothing to see here.	Neat te sjen hjir.
But we would soon be together.	Mar wy soene gau tegearre wêze.
And scared of me.	En bang foar my.
He had now begun.	Hy wie no begûn.

And that will not be easy.	En dat sil net maklik wêze.
But he got away.	Mar hy kaam fuort.
You would watch that movie.	Jo soene dy film sjen.
I was happy about it.	Ik wie der bliid fan.
And that, my friends, is it.	En dat, myn freonen, is it.
He knew he could not win.	Hy wist dat er net winne koe.
That's what we say.	Dat sizze wy.
He went through those things.	Hy is troch dy dingen gien.
I had seen her do that before.	Ik hie har dat earder dwaan sjoen.
We can not leave this kind of thing.	Wy kinne dit soarte fan net litte.
We did not know.	Wy wisten it net.
We talk about it and then we can go.	Wy prate der oer en dan kinne wy ​​gean.
There is no water at the lake.	Der is gjin wetter by de mar.
There was nothing more to do.	Der wie neat mear te dwaan.
She had a book with her, but she never opened it.	Se hie in boek by har, mar se die it noait iepen.
Love you, girl.	Hâld fan dy, famke.
Well, it's coming through you.	No, it komt troch dy.
He looked in there.	Hy seach der yn.
Could not be better.	Koe net better.
We believe they are.	Wy leauwe dat se binne.
We did not know you.	Wy koene dy net.
All being is that.	Alle wêzen is dat.
Can do this better.	Kin dit better.
I'm sure you know these things.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo dizze dingen witte.
The two do not come together.	De twa komme net mei elkoar.
They would not go.	Se soene net gean.
It was actually fun to watch.	It wie eins leuk om te sjen.
It's so good to be back.	It is sa goed om werom te wêzen.
But that's a good idea.	Mar dat is in goed idee.
But they were clearly happy.	Mar se wiene dúdlik bliid.
He seems to like it.	Hy liket it leuk te hawwen.
I did not want to leave.	Ik woe net fuort.
But he did not tell his father.	Mar hy fertelde syn heit net.
We know what they did.	Wy witte wat se dien hawwe.
They were happy for him as a person.	Se wiene bliid foar him as persoan.
It's been in her family ever since.	It is sûnt dy tiid yn har famylje.
You have to go to school every day.	Jo moatte alle dagen nei skoalle.
I went out to eat her.	Ik gie út om har te iten.
However, this is not the case.	Hoe dan ek, sa is it net.
They need something to eat.	Se hawwe wat te iten nedich.
He will be ready to go.	Hy sil klear wêze om te gean.
There is not much more to go.	Der is net sa folle mear te gean.
There are none.	Der binne gjin.
He had not said enough yet.	Hy hie noch net genôch sein.
The problem is that we do not have enough water.	It probleem is dat wy net genôch wetter hawwe.
Be very careful now.	Wês no tige foarsichtich.
Found our boy here.	Fûn ús jonge hjir.
I'm sorry to say that, but it's true.	It spyt my om te sizzen dat, mar it is wier.
It always did.	It die altyd.
She was happy to see everyone eating.	Se wie bliid om elkenien iten te sjen.
She worried about him.	Se makke har soargen oer him.
They said it never could, but our father did.	Se seine dat it noait koe, mar ús heit hat it dien.
But this is not that day.	Mar dit is net dy dei.
Ill, has been so long.	Siik, is sa lang west.
He would not talk to me.	Hy soe net mei my prate.
It was just them or me.	It wiene gewoan se of ik.
You have too.	Jo hawwe ek.
I talk to my wife like that too.	Ik praat ek sa mei myn frou.
But it's not here yet.	Mar it is hjir noch net.
My name was different too.	Myn namme wie ek oars.
You have to believe me.	Jo moatte my leauwe.
I think he has.	Ik tink dat hy hat.
Told her she would get in trouble.	Fertelde har dat se yn de problemen komme soe.
It was hard, so hard.	It wie dreech, sa dreech.
It will not be good for you.	It sil jo net goed wêze.
She could not agree.	Se koe it net iens wêze.
Nothing had ever done him any good.	Neat hie him oait sa goed dien.
So it's easy to get too much.	Sa is it maklik om te folle te krijen.
It's not fun.	It is net leuk.
Children can not even speak now.	Bern kin no net iens prate.
Thoughts come easily.	Gedachten komme maklik.
I can work with that.	Dêr kin ik mei wurkje.
It was too good to be true.	It wie te moai om wier te wêzen.
She got tired easily.	Se waard maklik wurch.
Go on, 'he said.	Gean troch,' sei er.
It just will not happen.	It sil gewoan net barre.
Just have to.	Krekt moatte.
The man had been neither old nor sick.	De man hie noch âld noch siik west.
Same way.	Deselde manier.
This can be a week or two.	Dit kin in wike as twa wêze.
I'll just make one.	Ik sil mar ien meitsje.
I just saw the movie.	Ik haw krekt de film sjoen.
She no longer thinks of him.	Se tinkt him net mear.
Me and my husband.	Ik en myn man.
So not now, when?	Sa net no, wannear?
I will take your word for it.	Ik sil jo wurd foar it nimme.
In life, really.	Yn it libben, echt.
I'm not sure how much.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoefolle.
But he did not get the chance.	Mar hy krige de kâns net.
This is the only one.	Dit is de ienige.
Maybe better than you even know.	Miskien better as jo sels witte.
We need more of that.	Dêr ha wy mear fan nedich.
I'm just back from the meeting.	Ik bin krekt werom fan de gearkomste.
What it is today.	Wat it hjoed is.
He looked at me.	Hy seach my oan.
Time I go too.	Tiid dat ik ek gean.
I'm surprised about you.	Ik bin ferrast oer dy.
It does not look bad.	It sjocht der net min út.
We can not hurt this girl.	Wy kinne dit famke net sear dwaan.
She cared nothing for me.	Se joech neat om my.
It was easy.	It wie maklik.
The only way is to love him.	De ienige manier is om fan him te hâlden.
Nobody told him anything.	Nimmen fertelde him wat.
Talk for an hour.	Praat foar in oere.
I'm just not going.	Ik gean gewoan net.
And then, we did it.	En dan, wy diene it.
He likes me better too.	Hy liket my ek better.
But they were ready to go.	Mar se wiene ree om te gean.
And it had to be done soon.	En it moast gau dien wurde.
This is not very fun.	Dit is net hiel leuk.
I asked him.	Ik frege him.
She will not believe me.	Se sil my net leauwe.
You know where everything is.	Jo witte wêr't alles is.
All my friends are here.	Al myn freonen binne hjir.
And that has never been done.	En dat is nea dien.
She was very worried.	Se wie tige soargen.
I know that.	Dat wit ik wol.
Maybe one day it would.	Miskien ien dei soe it.
She took him over.	Se naam him oer.
I'm really sorry.	It spyt my echt.
Everything has to be her way.	Alles moat har manier wêze.
Everyone there knew him.	Elkenien dêr koe him.
That's what makes this different.	Dat is wat dit oars makket.
Or if you do.	Of as jo dogge.
I'm a good friend.	Ik bin in goede freon.
If only he were here, he would tell the truth.	As hjir mar no, hy soe de wierheid prate.
I feel good.	Ik fiel my goed.
She has lived in a big city all her life.	Se hat har hiele libben yn in grutte stêd wenne.
Somehow he knew.	Op ien of oare manier wist er.
It doesn't matter to me.	It makket my neat út.
She was fine with it.	Se wie der goed mei.
Doing it is hard work.	It dwaan fan it is hurd wurk.
I wonder who they might be.	Ik freegje my ôf wa't se wêze kinne.
I went through before he had a chance to say anything.	Ik gie troch foardat hy de kâns hie om wat te sizzen.
Work with them.	Wurkje mei har.
I bought it.	Ik kocht it.
I do not know if we can win.	Ik wit net oft wy winne kinne.
Do not want to leave her car there.	Wol har auto dêr net litte.
And here you can do nothing with.	En hjir kinne jo neat mei.
He became very angry.	Hy waard tige lilk.
They could not do enough for you.	Se koene net genôch foar jo dwaan.
I will try it tomorrow.	Ik sil it moarn besykje.
We good people work hard.	Wy goede minsken wurkje hurd.
Take that hand away!	Nim dy hân fuort!
Does the child look like that?	Sjocht it bern sa?
Do what you want.	Doch wat jo wolle.
I can hardly believe it.	Ik kin it hast net leauwe.
Had not been there.	Hie der net west.
It was in a school.	It wie yn in skoalle.
Well done.	Goed dien.
It's not trying to be.	It is net besykje te wêzen.
It just does not sit in him.	It sit gewoan net yn him.
Do what you have to.	Doch wat jo moatte.
They may not be sure of what they know.	Se binne miskien net wis fan wat se witte.
There's only one bad thing left.	Der is mar ien min ding oer.
The film has been seen before.	De film is al earder sjoen.
They take some food.	Se nimme har wat iten.
That's up to you.	Dat is oan dy.
Be very careful.	Wês tige foarsichtich.
All we have so far is a name.	Alles wat wy oant no ta hawwe is in namme.
It became our thing.	It waard ús ding.
I have more than enough.	Ik haw mear as genôch.
I will need it.	Ik sil it nedich hawwe.
I'm a little busy.	Ik bin it wat drok.
I'm sorry, everyone, she thought.	It spyt my, elkenien, tocht se.
His life is ready.	Syn libben is klear.
So does his wife.	Dat docht syn frou ek.
We can not let this happen, not right now.	Wy kinne dit net barre litte, net no.
Of course they could not.	Fansels koene se net.
That he made me into the bad guy.	Dat er my yn 'e minne keardel makke.
But they could not.	Mar se koene net.
I went where the party was.	Ik gie wêr't it feest wie.
You thought they needed it.	Jo tocht dat se it nedich hawwe.
The kids are good.	De bern binne goed.
If you do not know, ask.	As jo ​​​​net witte, freegje dan.
So the food is out.	Sa is it iten út.
That was not her.	Dat wie se net.
I will not do it that way.	Ik sil it net sa dwaan.
But what you may not know is that they are there for a reason.	Mar wat jo miskien net witte is dat se der binne foar in reden.
I was happy with it.	Ik ha der bliid mei west.
She has many friends.	Se hat in protte freonen.
We may be too late.	Wy kinne te let wêze.
He never wants that.	Dat wol er noait.
She did not know why.	Se wist net wêrom.
Glad to have you.	Bliid dy te hawwen.
It will always be.	It sil altyd wêze.
And then you can look at it.	En dan kinne jo der nei sjen.
Too good, actually.	Te goed, eins.
Love me, love me, love me.	Hâld fan my, hâld fan my, hâld fan my.
He saw me play it.	Hy seach my spylje it.
They are doing well here.	Se dogge it hjir goed.
Then she's gone.	Dan is se fuort.
Just feel sick.	Fiel my gewoan siik.
This can actually not be done.	Dit kin eins net dien wurde.
She wanted people.	Se woe minsken.
Just give what you can.	Jou gewoan wat jo kinne.
I should have helped him keep that guy under water.	Ik hie him helpe moatten dy keardel ûnder it wetter te hâlden.
He already knows that.	Dat wit er al.
It did not happen that often.	It barde net sa faak.
I'm so, that's good.	Ik bin sa, dat is goed.
She wanted it so badly that she actually tried it.	Se woe it sa graach dat se eins besocht.
She did not tell her that she was not coming back.	Se fertelde har net dat se net werom kaam.
It can not be otherwise.	It kin net oars.
That's your job.	Dat is dyn wurk.
He was not awake yet.	Hy wie noch net wekker.
They could not find one. 	Se koene net ien fine. 
I do not know exactly how to tell you this.	Ik wit net krekt hoe't ik dy dit fertelle moat.
He obviously will not.	Hy sil fansels net.
I'm not sure.	Ik bin der net wis fan.
Come buy, come buy.	Kom keapje, kom keapje.
He died when he was a boy.	Hy stoar doe't er in jonge wie.
I said this.	Ik sei dit.
In humans, they could not see anyone.	By minsken koene se gjinien sjen.
He didn't look at her anymore.	Hy seach har net mear oan.
They will do what they think is right.	Se sille dwaan wat se tinke dat it goed is.
It's a time for friends and family to get together.	It is in tiid foar freonen en famylje om tegearre te kommen.
It's good to be good.	It is goed om goed te wêzen.
I'll try.	Ik sil it besykje.
I could find nothing.	Ik koe neat fine.
I thought we were.	Ik tocht dat wy wiene.
I wonder what you think of it.	Ik freegje my ôf wat jo der fan fine.
He has been with us for over a year now.	Hy is no mear as in jier by ús.
She did not know it was going to happen that way.	Se koe net witte dat it sa komme soe.
I'm so happy.	Ik bin sa bliid.
It was easy to do.	It wie maklik te dwaan.
It may take some time.	It kin in bytsje tiid nimme.
I did not touch anything.	Ik rekke neat oan.
We did not do that.	Dat hawwe wy net dien.
I'll go along when we're through.	Ik gean mei as wy troch binne.
The other man can see that.	De oare man kin dat sjen.
And he still sees a young man.	En hy sjocht noch altyd in jonge man.
What she did not want to do, not yet.	Wat se net dwaan woe, noch net.
But open to nothing.	Mar iepen op neat.
Never done.	Nea dien.
Okay, but the same.	Goed, mar itselde.
And that, he thought, was exactly what he wanted.	En dat, tocht er, wie krekt wat er woe.
Almost everyone does.	Hast elkenien docht.
Do not worry if you can not make it.	Sit gjin soargen as jo it net kinne meitsje.
It's that.	It is dat.
Yes.	Jo.
He would not know what struck him.	Hy soe net witte wat him rekke.
This is where we're going.	Dit is wêr't wy hinne geane.
But he had been wrong.	Mar hy hie ferkeard west.
The question is what else can they try.	De fraach is wat se oars kinne besykje.
I was big time.	Ik wie grutte tiid.
Things are bad there.	Dingen binne min dêr.
I have the work for me.	Ik haw it wurk foar my.
He knew he was not wrong here.	Hy wist dat er hjir net ferkeard wie.
The woman got better.	De frou waard better.
We are not interested.	Wy binne net ynteressearre.
But you already know that.	Mar dat witte jo al.
He was a nice kid, but kind was not good enough.	Hy wie in aardich bern, mar aardich wie net goed genôch.
Did it to me.	Hat it my dien.
But it works well for me.	Mar it wurket goed foar my.
This thing really did not get it.	Dit ding krige it echt net.
That woman is very beautiful.	Dy frou is tige moai.
And what he does not do is not so nice either.	En wat er net docht is ek net sa moai.
He would ask her if he was the father.	Hy soe har freegje oft er de heit wie.
He was the last to see his mother.	Hy wie de lêste dy't syn mem seach.
I was really into it.	Ik siet der echt yn.
We will not have as much time as we had hoped.	Wy sille net safolle tiid hawwe as wy hope hiene.
More is coming soon.	Der komt gau mear.
How much more for me.	Hoefolle mear foar my.
We are still children.	Wy binne noch bern.
She is one of them too.	Se is der ek ien fan.
The police said they did not.	De plysje sei dat se net diene.
They really should have known better.	Se hiene echt better witte moatten.
But of course no one had.	Mar fansels gjinien hie.
You should have seen her.	Do hiest har sjen moatten.
Tomorrow we would pay her.	Moarn soene wy ​​har betelje.
I had thought of this too.	Ik hie hjir ek oan tocht.
Which will be soon.	Wat sil gau wêze.
The problem is that you need to know how to do it.	It probleem is dat jo moatte witte hoe't jo it dwaan.
No wife, no children.	Gjin frou, gjin bern.
It's obviously not tonight.	It is fansels net fannacht.
And you did not do that either.	En dat diene jo ek net.
I've seen what he can do.	Ik haw sjoen wat er kin.
This should not happen again.	Dit moat net wer barre.
I'll find a way.	Ik sil in manier fine.
There would be more to come.	Der soe noch mear komme.
And you do not have to worry.	En jo hoege gjin soargen.
I'm so glad to be here with you.	Ik bin sa bliid om hjir by dy te wêzen.
I hope you are not.	Ik hoopje dat jo net binne.
If they can do that, they can do anything.	As se dat kinne, kinne se alles dwaan.
That you believe it's good.	Dat jo leauwe dat it goed is.
He wants nothing more than to go with her.	Hy wol neat oars as mei har te gean.
It's enough time for me to get angry.	It is genôch tiid foar my om lilk te wurden.
He's old now when he's still with us.	Hy is no âld as er noch by ús is.
Not really, but it seemed so.	Net echt, mar it like sa.
He was not convinced of anything.	Hy wie der neat fan oertsjûge.
I just can not say.	Ik kin gewoan net sizze.
They go back almost a year.	Se geane hast in jier werom.
We are not.	Wy binne it net.
But those people are wrong.	Mar dy minsken binne ferkeard.
No problem there either.	Dêr ek gjin probleem.
He had what he needed.	Hy hie wat er nedich hie.
I was the last thing she ever saw.	Ik wie it lêste wat se ea seach.
We almost had him.	Wy hiene him hast.
He was the only one here who could see it.	Hy wie hjir de iennichste dy't it sjen koe.
It is not life.	It is net it libben.
I come from a big city.	Ik kom út in grutte stêd.
I never knew which one.	Ik wist noait hokker.
Somehow it is not as easy as you think.	Op ien of oare manier is it net sa maklik as jo tinke.
At first he will have no idea what's going on.	Hy sil earst hielendal gjin idee hawwe wat der oan de hân is.
I would never have so much money.	Ik soe noait safolle jild hawwe.
I think give him some more time.	Ik tink, jou him noch wat tiid.
And that was exactly what he had done.	En dat hie hy krekt dien.
I really had a problem with this.	Ik hie echt in probleem mei dizze.
That made them two of a kind.	Dat makke se twa fan in soarte.
You know it's true.	Jo witte dat it wier is.
We are after the truth.	Wy binne nei de wierheid.
This was my husband.	Dit wie myn man.
Don’t let it get any better from you.	Lit it net better fan dy krije.
It looked like he's been doing this his whole life.	It like derop dat er dit syn hiele libben dien hie.
But they were not, she knew.	Mar dat wiene se net, wist se.
Has has has.	Har har har.
He would not take a chance.	Hy soe gjin kâns nimme.
Let me go.	Lit my gean.
There was not much in it, but there was something.	Der siet net folle yn, mar der wie wat.
About three times.	Sa as trije kear.
Well done.	Goed dien.
Should not be so difficult.	Moat net sa dreech wêze.
I never told him.	Ik haw it him noait ferteld.
What has become of him?	Wat is der fan him wurden?
He is more than good.	Hy is mear as goed.
I will look around me.	Ik sil om my hinne sjen.
I've seen it.	Ik haw it sjoen.
He comes from in the.	Hy komt fan yn de.
And no one said a word.	En nimmen sei in wurd.
What he did was wrong.	Wat hy die wie ferkeard.
More than anything, she could not be bought.	Mear as alles koe se net kocht wurde.
That we work through that.	Dat wy wurkje dêr troch.
It was a very young school.	It wie in tige jonge skoalle.
And it works really well.	En it wurket echt goed.
But the teacher is more interested.	Mar de learaar is mear ynteressearre.
I've never been good at it.	Ik haw der noait goed yn west.
We do not need your help.	Wy hawwe jo help net nedich.
And then it happens again.	En dan bart it wer.
I do not know how to tell you what happened.	Ik wit net hoe't ik dy fertelle moat wat der bard is.
She is not afraid to say her thoughts.	Se is net bang om har gedachten te sizzen.
No one should be here.	Gjinien moat hjir wêze.
He looked after it very well.	Hy seach der tige goed nei.
Maybe she was really trying to help.	Miskien besocht se echt te helpen.
I'm not done with your hand yet.	Ik bin noch net klear mei dyn hân.
He walked into his house.	Hy rûn yn syn hûs.
And it bothers me.	En it makket my út.
The plan was ready.	It plan wie klear.
Even then, it does not have to be.	Ek dan hoecht it net te wêzen.
No one will get such an opportunity again.	Gjinien sil wer sa'n kâns krije.
Have no father.	Gjin heit hawwe.
They have not found him yet.	Se hawwe him noch net fûn.
There is no one left.	Der is gjinien oer.
But it seems like someone should think it can.	Mar it liket derop dat immen tinke moat dat it kin.
But he needs you.	Mar hy hat dy nedich.
I said they hurt too much.	Ik sei dat se te sear diene.
No one comes in or out.	Nimmen komt yn of út.
I must have worked really hard as a kid.	Ik moat echt hurd wurke hawwe as bern.
He was not at school today.	Hy wie hjoed net op skoalle.
Then she could love him.	Dan koe se fan him hâlde.
I wish him the best.	Ik winskje him it bêste.
We always think of them, wherever we are.	Wy tinke altyd oan har, wêr't wy ek binne.
They really have no idea what they're talking about.	Se hawwe echt gjin idee wêr't se it oer hawwe.
Not for a year or two.	Net foar in jier as twa.
It is there, even so.	It is der, sels sa.
We need your help to keep it going.	Wy moatte jo help hawwe om it te hâlden.
How long.	Hoe lang.
He will get you and your family through this one way or another.	Hy sil jo en jo famylje op ien of oare manier troch dizze krije.
I do it like twice a week.	Ik doch it as twa kear yn 'e wike.
But it was my only hope.	Mar it wie myn ienige hope.
We had worked so hard for this day.	Wy hiene sa hurd wurke foar dizze dei.
Nothing will happen.	Der sil neat barre.
They look very much like humans.	Se lykje tige op minsken.
She opened it and saw two things.	Se die it iepen en seach twa dingen.
Has this happened before?	Is dit earder bard?
There was no one there.	Dêr wie gjinien.
Then he goes in to talk to her.	Dan giet er yn om mei har te praten.
We've seen both.	Wy hawwe beide sjoen.
No one even knew it was there.	Nimmen wist sels dat it der wie.
We know where you work.	Wy witte wêr't jo wurkje.
The first year we did that.	It earste jier ha wy dat dien.
Never had one problem.	Nea hie ien probleem.
And then they do.	En dan dogge se.
He worked with my father.	Hy wurke mei myn heit.
It was here first.	It wie hjir earst.
I do not think that will happen this year.	Ik tink net dat dat dit jier bart.
He was here, saw her.	Hy wie hjir, seach har.
I was in his mind.	Ik wie yn syn gedachten.
It was not, but something happened.	It wie net, mar der barde wat.
Hope, for a better life.	Hoopje, foar in better libben.
That she wants it does not matter.	Dat se it wol, makket neat út.
Either way, you need to get out of here.	Hoe dan ek, jo moatte hjir wei gean.
He may be the only one.	Hy kin de ienige wêze.
He thought clearly, and that was good.	Hy tocht dúdlik, en dat wie goed.
Now, get out of the way.	No, gean út 'e wei.
He had never seen such a dog before.	Sa'n hûn hie er noch nea sjoen.
We can only let them take care of them.	Wy kinne se dan mar foar har soargje litte.
There was something else.	Der wie wat oars.
She had never seen such a thing.	Se hie noch noait sa'n ding sjoen.
We're afraid we'll never get through them.	Wy binne bang dat wy noait troch har komme kinne.
She did not return it.	Se joech it net werom.
It can be busy.	It kin drok wêze.
And now here.	En no hjir.
He would have to do that.	Hy soe dêr oan moatte.
The child had to leave.	It bern moast fuort.
Everyone made money.	Elkenien makke jild.
I did not want to be here.	Ik woe hjir net wêze.
You did it right.	Jo hawwe it goed dien.
But we did not keep him long.	Mar wy hâlde him net lang.
Please let us know how you heard about us.	Lit ús asjebleaft witte hoe't jo oer ús heard hawwe.
I made money.	Ik makke jild.
We just stay here.	Wy bliuwe hjir gewoan.
But we're talking now.	Mar wy prate no.
What had been all day.	Wat de hiele dei west hie.
They both look so happy.	Se lykje beide sa bliid.
Nobody wants that !.	Nimmen wol dat!.
I think no one can.	Ik tink dat gjinien kin.
To be honest, no one expected this to happen.	Om wier te wêzen, gjinien hie ferwachte dat dit soe barre.
Just keep going.	Gewoan troch gean.
It is.	It is.
I go now, now, and tell her.	Ik gean no, no, en fertel har.
Nobody knew.	Nimmen wist.
But he had now begun.	Mar hy wie no begûn.
You are very different.	Do bist hiel oars.
What a first day.	Wat in earste dei.
He can if he wants to.	Hy kin as er wol.
It was really beautiful.	It wie echt moai.
He was glad to be gone.	Hy wie graach fuort.
There was also bad.	Der wie ek min.
You will need one to drive you back and forth.	Jo sille ien nedich wêze om jo hinne en wer te riden.
Still the same problem.	Noch altyd itselde probleem.
I did not have one friend.	Ik hie net ien freon.
I never told you.	Ik ha it dy nea ferteld.
It is no longer what it used to be.	It is net mear wat it wie.
He wanted to see me one last time.	Hy woe my noch in lêste kear sjen.
She even knew so little.	Se wist sels sa'n bytsje.
And maybe they would not.	En miskien soene se net.
It's fine with him.	It is goed mei him.
I'm sure she knows who it is.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se wit wa't it is.
They just can not have too much of him.	Se kinne gewoan net te folle fan him hawwe.
It happened too easily.	It barde te maklik.
It looks well done.	It sjocht der goed dien út.
There were problems.	Der kaam problemen.
I met them.	Ik moete se.
I do that very well.	Dat doch ik hiel goed.
To stop reading.	Om ophâlde mei lêzen.
Make nothing up.	Meitsje neat op.
But that would not help.	Mar dat soe net helpe.
And you can tell me what happened.	En jo kinne my fertelle wat der bard is.
It's too hard for her.	It is har te dreech.
They talk you talk.	Se prate jo praat.
Maybe he knew.	Miskien wist er.
And it said a lot more about her.	En it sei folle mear oer har.
We go, we talk, we talk.	Wy geane, wy prate, wy prate.
It would not hurt.	It soe gjin sear dwaan.
Everyone who was anyone was there.	Elkenien dy't immen wie wie der.
You do not need to know who you are going to be against.	Jo moatte net witte tsjin wa't jo sille wêze.
Even from you.	Sels fan dy.
He's coming back tonight, he said.	Hy komt fannacht wer, sei er.
This is all we can do.	Dit is alles wat wy kinne dwaan.
I've never been.	Ik ha noait west.
Only never quite enough.	Allinnich nea hielendal genôch.
He could not get out of her.	Hy koe net by har út.
And we should not.	En wy moatte net.
Let's go into the house, and do the work.	Lit ús yn 'e hûs gean, en it wurk dwaan.
That's what we do.	Dat dogge wy.
You have to be careful how you take these things.	Jo moatte foarsichtich wêze hoe't jo dizze dingen nimme.
He wants to do things.	Hy wol dingen dwaan.
Or so she had always thought.	Of dat hie se altyd tocht.
I see what happens to me.	Ik sjoch wat der mei my bart.
I had to get them back.	Ik moast se werom krije.
They are good people.	It binne goede minsken.
I would never see this thing.	Ik soe dit ding nea sjen.
That is, if you can believe them.	Dat is, as jo se leauwe kinne.
That was totally wrong.	Dat wie hielendal ferkeard.
What they did was not as good as what they were.	Wat se diene wie net sa goed as wat se wiene.
She knew what he was talking about.	Se wist wêr't er it oer hie.
See how tired she is.	Sjoch hoe wurch se is.
I have a great family and great friends.	Ik haw in grutte famylje en grutte freonen.
Now you can see exactly what you want to see.	No kinne jo krekt sjen wat jo wolle sjen.
You just do what you can.	Jo dogge gewoan wat jo kinne.
And could see nothing.	En koe neat sjen.
She could not stand this, day after day.	Se koe dit net oan, dei nei dei.
I hope to find out.	Ik hoopje it út te finen.
Both of us were.	Beide fan ús wiene.
But we still do not know why or what happened.	Mar wy witte noch net wêrom of wat der bard is.
But they are not necessary.	Mar se binne net nedich.
Let's eat.	Lit ús ite.
You will never find her.	Jo sille har nea fine.
Happy!	Bliid!
What had happened had happened.	Wat der bard wie, wie bard.
Tell her she's free.	Fertel har dat se frij is.
It's pretty easy to make it work.	It is frij maklik om it wurk te meitsjen.
I tried it too.	Ik ha it ek besocht.
I really believe this is true.	Ik leau echt dat dit wier is.
So it's here.	Sa is it hjir.
I do not want this.	Ik wol dit net.
If you know, please help.	As jo ​​​​witte, help asjebleaft.
They love their work.	Se hâlde fan har wurk.
And he knows us.	En hy ken ús.
And people who are still here.	En minsken dy't hjir noch binne.
That's his name.	Dat is syn namme.
Nobody likes him.	Nimmen liket him.
To tell her everything.	Om har alles te fertellen.
I no longer think it will make me happy.	Ik tink net mear dat it my bliid meitsje sil.
I thought now.	Ik tocht no.
I tried it on a few for you.	Ik besocht it op in pear foar dy.
Because it wants to.	Om it wol.
But you're not telling anyone where you are.	Mar jo fertelle gjinien wêr't jo binne.
I'm sure there should be a few.	Ik bin der wis fan dat der in pear wêze moatte.
She says she's busy.	Se seit dat se it drok hat.
I'm glad I'm home.	Ik bin bliid dat ik thús bin.
No one knows where they are coming from.	Nimmen wit wêr't se wei komme.
That's not fun.	Dat is net leuk.
But this is just.	Mar dit is gewoan.
You are the more.	Jo binne de mear.
Happened this month.	Bard dizze moanne.
That's what he does now.	Dat docht er no.
The only way in or out is that door.	De ienige manier yn of út is dy doar.
We need them to tell us who we are.	Wy hawwe se nedich om ús te fertellen wa't wy binne.
I do not even think he loves you.	Ik tink net iens dat er fan dy hâldt.
For me, this is a good opportunity.	Foar my is dit in goede kâns.
He had been.	Hy hie west.
It was nothing that came to me.	It wie neat dat by my kaam.
Be a little worried again.	Wês wer wat soargen.
It would have been a problem.	It soe in probleem west hawwe.
I will say nothing about his father.	Ik sil neat sizze oer syn heit.
You do not have to do it.	Jo moatte it net dwaan.
He could not stay in here.	Hy koe hjir net yn bliuwe.
I have to go back to that.	Ik moat der op werom.
But he says nothing.	Mar hy seit neat.
Her work was gone.	Har wurk wie fuort.
My parents were too busy to see me.	Myn âlden wiene te drok om my te sjen.
He was not sure how he would do it.	Hy wie net wis hoe't er it dwaan soe.
But this was not too long.	Mar dit wie net te lang.
I let go.	Ik liet my gean.
But it gets there.	Mar it komt der.
They would not talk to him.	Se soene net mei him prate.
He had started it.	Hy wie it begûn.
For sure nothing could come of it.	Der koe foar wis neat fan komme.
Things are being found these days.	Dingen wurde dizze dagen fûn.
He has nothing more to give.	Hy hat net mear te jaan.
That's done.	Dat is dien.
We have .	Wy hawwe .
And we can.	En wy kinne.
I could not believe it and did not know what to say.	Ik koe it net leauwe en wist net wat ik sizze moast.
I saw her talking to a man today.	Ik seach har hjoed prate mei in man.
For me, there was no one in that room like me.	Foar my wie der gjinien yn dy keamer as ik.
I'm not sick.	Ik bin net siik.
This one was real.	Dizze wie echt.
You are my mother.	Do bist myn mem.
It can still happen.	It kin noch barre.
I'm coming here.	Ik kom hjir.
Probably nothing would be said.	Wierskynlik soe neat sein wurde.
Here we are in the office.	Hjir binne wy ​​op it kantoar.
Look closely at what's going on.	Sjoch goed nei wat der bart.
Not a whole lot of people that day.	Net in hiele protte minsken dy dei.
They will do well.	Se sille it goed dwaan.
I can never be her.	Ik kin har noait wêze.
What he wanted from her and why.	Wat er fan har woe en wêrom.
Not even here.	Net iens hjir.
That I could say.	Dat koe ik sizze.
I would not be here if it were not for him.	Ik soe hjir net wêze as it net foar him wie.
I never told anyone.	Ik haw it noait oan ien ferteld.
It must be done so.	It moat sa dien wurde.
Well, really two.	No, echt twa.
He did not know what she had said.	Hy wist net wat se sein hie.
You are also very wrong.	Jo binne ek hiel ferkeard.
Nothing goes here.	Hjir giet neat.
Be who you are.	Wês wa't jo binne.
You can stay as long as you want.	Jo kinne bliuwe sa lang as jo wolle.
We're a little tired.	Wy binne wat wurch.
School would open soon.	Skoalle soe gau iepen.
Always away from home.	Altyd fuort fan hûs.
I do not know how they knew where to find it.	Ik wit net hoe't se wisten wêr't se it fine kinne.
We can not return.	Wy kinne net werom.
You go and get ready.	Jo geane en meitsje jo klear.
Everyone is fine.	Elkenien is goed.
Is this it.	Is dit it.
It's not there.	It is der net.
I was not ready.	Ik wie net klear.
And now she was scared.	En no wie se bang.
I thought about you a lot.	Ik ha in protte oan dy tocht.
You will see, one of these days.	Jo sille sjen, ien fan dizze dagen.
He's doing it right now.	Hy docht it no goed.
She has nothing there.	Se hat dêr neat.
I know it's different here.	Ik wit dat it hjir oars is.
My things are all gone.	Myn dingen binne allegear fuort.
I do not think about it.	Ik tink der net oer.
Let's just be human.	Lit ús gewoan minsken wêze.
In and out, one.	Yn en út, ien.
He's not even coming back.	Hy komt net iens werom.
He could not grow old.	Hy koe net âld wurde.
They are there for me.	Se binne der foar my.
And they did just that.	En dat diene se krekt.
He is no longer a boy, but not yet a man.	Hy is gjin jonge mear, mar noch gjin man.
It is not yet clear who wants that.	It is noch net dúdlik wa't dat wol.
Now is the time to make money.	No is it tiid om jild yn te nimmen.
I'm afraid you can not come back.	Ik bin bang dat jo net werom komme kinne.
She has a job.	Se hat in baan.
He admitted that he had been wrong.	Hy joech ta dat er ferkeard west hie.
Well, here it comes, she thought.	No, hjir komt it, tocht se.
There were only three other people in the great room.	Der wiene mar trije oare minsken yn 'e grutte keamer.
He's one of my best friends.	Hy is ien fan myn bêste freonen.
They just had to ask.	Se hiene mar freegje moatten.
I really wanted to try it.	Ik woe it echt besykje.
We can do something.	Wy kinne wat dwaan.
Still no one came.	Noch altyd kaam net ien.
Well, actually it is.	No, eins is it.
Do not show everything you have done.	Net alles sjen litte wat jo dien hawwe.
Otherwise it is not.	Oars is it net.
That's exactly what our children do.	Dat is krekt wat ús bern dogge.
It seemed like he could do nothing.	It like wol oft er neat dwaan koe.
He always saw the best in people.	Hy seach altyd it bêste yn minsken.
Now, try it.	No, besykje it.
He died for me.	Hy stoar foar my.
I'm going to bed again.	Ik gean wer op bêd.
But she seemed happy.	Mar se like bliid.
But only one woman.	Mar mar ien frou.
I will not help you either.	Ik sil dy ek net helpe.
Many things tried.	In protte dingen besocht.
She wants to see a movie.	Se wol in film sjen.
My family loves it for food.	Myn famylje hâldt it foar it iten.
It has become necessary to me.	It is my nedich wurden.
I can not help him.	Ik kin him net helpe.
But they did not.	Mar dat diene se net.
Not too long.	Net te lang.
Someone give me a hand!	Immen jou my in hân!
But you're not really here.	Mar do bist hjir net echt.
They knew what to do.	Se wisten wat te dwaan.
Someone has to say something.	Immen moat wat sizze.
She really wanted that.	Dat woe se hiel graach.
And who they think we are.	En wa't se tinke dat wy binne.
The time is now.	De tiid is no.
She had tried it twice already.	Se hie it al twa kear besocht.
Many questions.	In protte fragen.
And now it happens at home.	En no bart it thús.
Maybe they are.	Miskien binne se.
I woke up early and set off.	Ik waard betiid wekker en sette ôf.
His children did too.	Syn bern diene ek.
But it would be clear if she was after and felt.	Mar it soe dúdlik wêze as se nei en fielde.
Wait for more.	Wachtsje op mear.
They were into other things.	Se wiene yn oare dingen.
He is in office now.	Hy is no op kantoar.
Today, two things happen.	Hjoed, twa dingen barre.
I have a few.	Ik haw in pear.
I want to do so many things.	Ik wol safolle dingen dwaan.
Your last time.	Jo lêste kear.
Give, and it will be given to you.	Jou, en it sil jo jûn wurde.
They just do not.	Dat dogge se gewoan net.
I know this is true.	Ik wit dat dit wier is.
I'm sure they did not.	Ik wit wis dat se it net diene.
This is not a person.	Dit is gjin persoan.
I could believe it myself.	Ik koe it sels leauwe.
You will, of course, do that too, but that can not be otherwise.	Jo sille dat fansels ek, mar dat kin net oars.
He had nothing left to go home to.	Hy hie neat mear om nei hûs te gean.
He opened his office.	Hy die syn kantoar iepen.
But everything has.	Mar alles hat.
You just did not really look at the man.	Jo hawwe gewoan net echt nei de man sjoen.
I should ask my dad one of these days.	Ik soe myn heit ien fan dizze dagen freegje moatte.
I went to school here.	Ik gie hjir nei skoalle.
But it's a good way out of town.	Mar it is in goede wei út 'e stêd.
The young man was surprised.	De jonge man wie ferrast.
Kids are angry these days.	Bern binne lilk dizze dagen.
All the time.	De hiele tiid.
The bus is busy.	De bus is drok.
Where does that money come from ?.	Wêr komt dat jild wei?.
We will talk about both.	Wy sille it oer beide hawwe.
When he looked back, he saw nothing.	As er werom seach, seach er neat.
I needed this today.	Ik hie dit hjoed nedich.
But he would not tell us what happened.    	Mar hy soe ús net fertelle wat der bard is.    
It's my name.	It is myn namme.
Never been before.	Noch noait earder west.
And it does not matter.	En it makket neat út.
She should never have agreed.	Se hie nea iens wêze moatten.
I have no idea what you're trying to do.	Ik haw gjin idee wat jo besykje te dwaan.
I know they are coming for me.	Ik wit dat se foar my komme.
She was so beautiful.	Se wie sa moai.
The way to her.	De wei nei har.
They can be his ashes.	Se kinne syn as wêze.
It sat and sat.	It siet en siet.
Get ready.	Meitsje dy klear.
He did not even die.	Hy stoar net iens.
That's all they make.	Dat is alles wat se meitsje.
I'm glad he said that.	Ik bin bliid dat er sei.
He gave me the money.	Hy joech my it jild.
She wanted a man, not a boy.	Se woe in man, gjin jonge.
To the food maybe.	Ta it iten miskien.
It hurts and it scares me.	It docht sear en it makket my bang.
She didn't have to say anything more.	Se hoegde neat mear te sizzen.
It's not the first time this has happened.	It is net de earste kear dat it barde.
Whatever you need, just let me know.	Wat jo ek nedich hawwe, lit it my gewoan witte.
You have to give people a chance.	Jo moatte minsken in kâns jaan.
Everyone does.	Elkenien docht.
I had to make it happen.	Ik moast it barre.
It could hold nothing now.	It koe no neat hâlde.
If not, well not.	As net, goed net.
I knew how to do that.	Ik wist hoe't ik dat dwaan moast.
Or just the movie.	Of gewoan de film.
If anyone can do this.	As immen dit kin dwaan.
And it's always for the better.	En it is altyd foar it better.
Money had nothing to do with it, she said.	Jild hie der neat mei te krijen, sei se.
In fact, we know very little about it.	Eins witte wy der mar in bytsje fan.
But it seems likely.	Mar it liket wierskynlik.
It's time he thought of a woman too.	It wurdt tiid dat er ek oan in frou tinkt.
It was as if she wanted nothing from him.	It wie as woe se neat fan him.
He does not want money.	Hy wol gjin jild.
In fact, he did not.	Eins hie er net.
He could not believe that his family was really talking about this.	Hy koe net leauwe dat syn famylje hjir echt oer praat.
So they are all against it.	Sa binne se der allegear tsjin.
He was your father.	Hy wie dyn heit.
I want you to stay here.	Ik wol dat jo hjir bliuwe.
He knows many things.	Hy wit in protte dingen.
Both are happy.	Beide binne bliid.
It did not matter to him.	It makke him neat út.
None of it will ever work.	Gjin fan it sil ea wurkje.
But the child does not speak.	Mar it bern praat net.
He's not here.	Hy is hjir net.
For the year.	Foar it jier.
So far, everything has worked out well.	Oant no ta hat alles goed wurke.
I need one.	Ik ha ien nedich.
I also worked against time.	Ik wurke ek tsjin de tiid.
This man was my everything.	Dizze man wie myn alles.
No give and take.	Gjin jaan en nimme.
I would go there but not often.	Ik soe der hinne gean mar net faak.
I believe him.	Ik leau him.
We would love to help.	Wy soene graach helpe.
My mother also asked me why.	Myn mem frege my ek wêrom.
But there is.	Mar der is.
Simply, nothing happens.	Gewoan, neat bart.
Maybe one day, my friend.	Miskien ien dei, myn freon.
Now back to work.	No wer oan it wurk.
We will make new friends.	Wy sille nije freonen meitsje.
I now give place to him in everything.	Ik jou no yn alles foar him plak.
I can not do it myself.	Ik kin it net sels dwaan.
It could be a really bad day today.	It koe hjoed in echt minne dei wêze.
She was not home yet.	Se wie noch net thús.
I had not seen the animal.	Ik hie it bist net sjoen.
I had to look back.	Ik moast werom sjen.
But they do not want to get out of there.	Mar se wolle der net út.
He could not help but see himself in the man.	Hy koe net oars as himsels yn 'e man te sjen.
He never said a word about it.	Hy sei der nea in wurd oer.
I'm talking about it in here.	Ik praat der oer yn hjir.
And liked it.	En fûn it leuk.
They are all still scared.	Se binne allegear noch bang.
It was difficult but it was necessary.	It wie dreech mar it wie nedich.
And the father never knew.	En de heit wist it noait.
It's what we do or make.	It is wat wy dogge of meitsje.
He wished she had everything.	Hy woe dat se alles hie.
It does nothing else.	It docht oars neat.
I'm sure you know what that is.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo witte wat dat is.
It looks really well made.	It sjocht der echt goed makke.
No problem, he said.	Gjin probleem, sei er.
That was just in time.	Dat wie krekt op tiid.
It can not even ask her.	It kin har net iens freegje.
I want to be more than a wife and mother.	Ik wol mear wêze as in frou en mem.
There were no words.	Der wiene gjin wurden.
It all started here.	It begûn hjir allegear.
His only pair.	Syn ienige pear.
I will see too.	Ik sil ek sjen.
You will not have them.	Jo sille har net hawwe.
I did not like this at all.	Ik mocht dit hielendal net.
Well then.	No dan.
It was not difficult.	It wie net dreech.
He did two things.	Hy die twa dingen.
I believe in him.	Ik leau yn him.
How she had come to him.	Hoe't se by him kaam wie.
He made him believe he could do anything.	Hy liet him leauwe dat hy alles koe.
I had to give back.	Ik moast werom jaan.
Better to get it over here and now.	Better om it hjir en no oer te krijen.
I should do more of these.	Ik soe mear fan dizze moatte dwaan.
I look back at the water.	Ik sjoch werom nei it wetter.
She had decided to tell.	Se hie besletten om te fertellen.
Now he just looked away.	No seach er allinnich mar fuort.
I found it for her.	Ik fûn it foar har.
She tried to find what she thought was best.	Se besocht te finen wat se tocht dat it bêste wie.
Sa bang.	Sa bang.
I'm back on time.	Ik bin wer op tiid.
Two months ago.	Twa moanne lyn.
She still could not believe how much could happen in one day.	Se koe noch altyd net leauwe hoefolle der op ien dei barre koe.
My first husband died.	Myn earste man stoar.
It was hard though.	It wie wol dreech.
things are good there.	dingen binne goed dêr.
Sure, this time they would do it.	Wis, dizze kear soene se it dwaan.
He comes into the open.	Hy komt yn it iepen.
He seemed surprised and happy to see me.	Hy like ferrast en bliid om my te sjen.
Take your time and think about it.	Nim jo tiid en tink der oer.
But it will not always be.	Mar it sil net altyd wêze.
She almost had.	Se hie hast.
It said his name under him.	It sei syn namme ûnder him.
Of course, people did that a bit.	Fansels diene de minsken dat in bytsje.
It's been good.	It is goed west.
What do you think of this ?.	Wat fine jo fan dizze?.
He had been my best friend.	Hy wie myn bêste freon west.
It really had.	It hie echt.
I think he can do it.	Ik tink dat hy it kin.
But he could not tell her the truth.	Mar hy koe har de wierheid net fertelle.
I do not think size is an issue.	Ik tink net dat grutte in probleem is.
It had nothing to do with us.	It hie neat mei ús te krijen.
I've been busy.	Ik haw it drok hân.
Get away from me!	Gean fan my ôf!
She has not seen it before.	Se hat it noch net earder sjoen.
A lot happened.	In protte barde.
So they want it.	Sa wolle se it wol.
Get out early this time of year.	Kom betiid út dizze tiid fan it jier.
She wants to see me.	Se wol my wol sjen.
Now may be the time.	No kin de tiid wêze.
You need to know this.	Jo moatte dit witte.
Nice.	Aardich.
It does not matter what it is.	It makket neat út wat it is.
He died for us.	Hy stoar foar ús.
He can do it with people too.	Hy kin it ek mei minsken.
I was just glad I was over it.	Ik wie gewoan bliid dat ik der mei oer wie.
It does not seem.	It liket net.
I know of the family.	Ik wit fan de famylje.
The kids were really happy to see their mother.	De bern wiene echt bliid om har mem te sjen.
All at three.	Allegear op trije.
A good idea.	In goed idee.
That's a busy weekend.	Dat is in drok wykein.
And he would.	En hy soe.
I would think about that tomorrow.	Dêr soe ik moarn oer tinke.
What is needed.	Wat is nedich.
I know he would not.	Ik wit dat hy net soe.
They really are.	Se binne eins.
I have not heard back yet.	Ik haw noch net werom heard.
You would all be better off.	Jo soene allegear better wêze.
Become when he died.	Wurden as hy stoar.
I really did not like it that much.	Ik hie it echt net sa leuk.
And they provide work.	En se soargje foar wurk.
No one else did very much to help.	Nimmen oars die hiel folle om te helpen.
As soe.	As soe.
Here at hand.	Hjir by de hân.
But this time he went through.	Mar dizze kear gie er troch.
You have to help people.	Jo moatte minsken helpe.
That we know of our father.	Dat witte wy fan ús heit.
I love talking to people.	Ik hâld fan praten mei minsken.
I'll tell you this from your mother.	Ik sil dy dit fan dyn mem fertelle.
Get there.	Kom der oan.
No one said otherwise.	Gjinien sei oars.
He got me well.	Hy krige my goed.
But not for food.	Mar net foar iten.
You will have to stay together.	Jo sille moatte bliuwe tegearre.
He will not tell you.	Hy sil it dy net fertelle.
That should be enough for both.	Dat soe foar beide wol genôch wêze moatte.
But you can do the right thing here.	Mar jo kinne hjir it goede ding dwaan.
Other than that, go for it.	Oars as dat, gean der foar.
He too had things to do.	Ek hy hie dingen te dwaan.
She felt different.	Se fielde har oars.
He wanted a life without me.	Hy woe in libben sûnder my.
I do not care.	Ik makket neat út.
Not many people are sticking to it right now.	Net folle minsken hâlde der no oan.
That was for sure.	Dat wie wis.
That was not the point.	Dêr gie it net om.
They have to pay for it.	Dêr moatte se foar betelje.
They have to do that, they can not.	Dat moatte se dwaan, dat kinne se net.
Mom is the word, for now.	Mem is it wurd, foar no.
They can make this movie.	Se kinne dizze film meitsje.
I just can not seem to get it to happen.	Ik kin gewoan net lykje dat it barre kin.
My thoughts are with you.	Myn gedachten binne by dy.
Together we take care of the children.	Tegearre soargje wy foar de bern.
I saw none of this.	Ik seach neat fan dit.
He stayed with a friend for a few days.	Hy bleau in pear dagen by in freon.
Nobody cares.	Nimmen makket him drok.
That's what we'll be doing next week.	Dat sille wy nije wike dwaan.
He goes away, you go away.	Hy giet fuort, do fuort.
They stay pretty good.	Se bliuwe aardich goed.
There is no way we can be so happy.	D'r is gjin manier dat wy sa bliid wêze kinne.
We have nothing to do with that.	Dêr ha wy neat oan.
It was the guy.	It wie de keardel.
You will get exactly what you are paying for and more.	Jo sille krekt krije wêr't jo foar betelje en mear.
It bothers me.	It makket my om.
With your words.	Mei dyn wurden.
They did that very well.	Dat diene se hiel goed.
Then we have.	Dan hawwe wy.
What could be the idea.	Wat kin it idee wêze.
How long ago it seemed.	Hoe lang lyn like it.
The children were so happy to have his help.	De bern wiene sa bliid om syn help te hawwen.
Looked at my dad.	Seach nei myn heit.
He could do it himself.	Hy koe himsels dit dwaan.
We take on who is there.	Wy nimme op wa't der is.
He looked at me again.	Hy seach my wer oan.
I have read some things that can help me to keep going.	Ik haw wat dingen lêzen dy't my kinne helpe om troch te gean.
This was what life was for.	Dit wie wêr't it libben foar wie.
It was a good plan, he thought.	It wie in goed plan, tocht er.
We're there for dinner.	Wy binne der foar it iten.
There is still work to be done.	Der is noch wurk te dwaan.
He might have said more.	Hy hie miskien mear sein.
Let the bad people not get it.	Lit de minne minsken it net krije.
Well, there is no help for that.	No, dêr is gjin help foar.
He gave us everything we have.	Hy joech ús alles wat wy hawwe.
Just to have it.	Krekt om it te hawwen.
Nobody cares.	Nimmen docht der oan.
I felt nothing.	Ik fielde neat.
She was very nice about it.	Se wie der hiel aardich oer.
Not that it will do much good.	Net dat it in protte goed dwaan sil.
Take some time off from work.	Nim wat tiid frij fan it wurk.
I could not get it out.	Ik koe it net út.
And you can have it.	En jo kinne it hawwe.
He had never seen him.	Hy hie him nea sjoen.
And it was really fun.	En it wie echt leuk.
Water will not work.	Wetter sil net wurkje.
I would never have told anyone else about it.	Ik soe der noait oan immen oars oer ferteld hawwe.
And you will be more.	En jo sille mear wêze.
He approached her cautiously.	Hy kaam foarsichtich by har oan.
We can do it again if we want.	Wy kinne it wer dwaan as wy wolle.
If you want to know.	As jo ​​witte wolle.
We do not have to say.	Wy moatte net sizze.
This is only the first day.	Dit is mar de earste dei.
It just makes it so.	It makket it gewoan sa.
He has a good job.	Hy hat in goede baan.
And there could be nothing more from them.	En der koe neat mear fan har krije.
It was one of the best.	It wie ien fan de bêste.
It was the last of its kind.	It wie de lêste yn syn soarte.
It was nothing like that.	It wie neat as dat.
I have to get out of here now.	Ik moat hjir no wei.
Hope you find what you like.	Hoopje jo fine wat jo leuk.
Those were for other people.	Dat wiene foar oare minsken.
I'm never quite sure about things in this family.	Ik bin noait hielendal wis fan dingen yn dizze famylje.
I will stay here again.	Ik sil bliuwe hjir wer.
No one could do anything.	Nimmen koe neat dwaan.
I let go and wait.	Ik lit gean en wachtsje.
For the first time, it became clear to me.	Foar it earst waard it my dúdlik.
We know that better.	Dat witte wy better.
That's the thing.	Dat is it ding.
And this is my house.	En dit is myn hûs.
But, this year is different for me.	Mar, dit jier is oars foar my.
It was time for bed.	It wie tiid foar bêd.
You let that happen.	Jo litte dat barre.
But, in truth, he does not hold much hope.	Mar, yn wierheid, hy hâldt net folle hope.
I could not either.	Ik koe ek net.
No one heard him, and no one gave him.	Nimmen hearde him, en nimmen joech him.
That's a good question.	Dat is in goede fraach.
And it will not be.	En it sil net wêze.
And bad at my job.	En min by myn wurk.
What to do?	Om wat te dwaan?
You will get much more out of this book if you do so.	Jo sille folle mear út dit boek krije as jo dat dogge.
He was sure of it.	Hy wie der wis fan.
She had no idea how she got here.	Se hie gjin idee hoe't se hjir kommen wie.
Enough for three people.	Genôch foar trije minsken.
This should go without saying.	Dit moat sûnder sizzen gean.
You do not do it for me.	Jo dogge it net foar my.
It's so beautiful underwater.	It is sa moai ûnder it wetter.
For me and then you do not get in there and want to.	Foar my en dan komme jo der net yn en wolle.
This thing here, that thing there.	Dit ding hjir, dat ding dêr.
I actually did.	Ik eins die.
I have said it over and over.	Ik haw it oer en oer sein.
Make it a day.	Meitsje der in dei fan.
But it is not, and they are not.	Mar it is net, en se binne net.
We will see him this year.	Wy sille him dit jier sjen.
He was there that day.	Hy wie der dy dei.
Someone made up the whole thing.	Immen makke it hiele ding op.
They were at the door again.	Se wiene wer by de doar.
Need to.	Moatte.
She had seen it before.	Se hie it earder sjoen.
He had had enough.	Hy hie genôch hân.
I know what he wants.	Ik wit wat er wol.
You stay out of trouble.	Jo bliuwe út de problemen.
And there are not so many of us.	En d'r binne net safolle fan ús.
My wife had no idea what she was getting.	Myn frou hie gjin idee wat se krige.
I doubt it though.	Ik twifelje der wol oan.
It was just easy.	Dit wie net maklik.
No one had told her what to do or where to be.	Nimmen hie har ferteld wat se dwaan moast of wêr't se wêze moast.
She had been hard on him, and she was not sure why.	Se hie hurd tsjin him west, en se wie net wis wêrom.
I wonder what will happen ?.	Ik freegje my ôf wat sil barre?.
These things are just not done.	Dizze dingen wurde gewoan net dien.
They did not even know where they lived.	Se wisten net iens wêr't se wenne.
Now he was no longer a boy.	No wie er gjin jonge mear.
You're better than me.	Do bist better as my.
I do not see a way out.	Ik sjoch der gjin wei út.
It does not matter how.	It makket neat út hoe.
It was so much, maybe too much.	It wie safolle, miskien te folle.
And it was he.	En it wie hy.
That we can get back.	Dat kinne wy ​​werom krije.
But wait, you say.	Mar wachtsje, sizze jo.
She was scared, but tried not to see it.	Se wie bang, mar besocht it net te sjen.
He's coming here now.	Hy komt hjir no.
Maybe even her father.	Miskien sels har heit.
That's good.	Dat is goed.
It's hard to say.	It is dreech om te sizzen.
I was too good for one man.	Ik wie te goed foar ien man.
Also back earlier.	Ek werom earder.
I think he left me.	Ik tink dat hy my liet.
It can not be him.	It kin him net wêze.
I do not know what else to say.	Ik wit net wat oars te sizzen.
I knew exactly what she had done.	Ik wist krekt wat se dien hie.
Try it !.	Besykje it !.
The other man seemed to be talking to himself.	De oare man like tsjin himsels te praten.
Tell me when you're ready.	Fertel my as jo klear binne.
I let them take it.	Ik lit se it nimme.
He is good, but not so good.	Hy is goed, mar net sa goed.
But here there was nothing to give.	Mar hjir wie der neat te jaan.
There was something wrong with me.	D'r wie my wol wat oan.
Well, not easy.	No, net maklik.
Can anyone help please ?.	Kin immen helpe asjebleaft?.
Well, it does not matter, that was a long time ago.	No, it makket neat út, dat wie lang lyn.
Join me for dinner in an hour.	Doch mei my foar it iten oer in oere.
But so this came out.	Mar sa kaam dizze út.
I feel bad for him in a way.	Ik fiel my op in manier min foar him.
I got a job.	Ik krige in baan.
Either she will buy it or she will not.	Of se sil it keapje of se sil it net.
It occurred to him that he could not be alone.	It kaam him op dat er net allinnich wêze mocht.
They were good kids.	It wiene goede bern.
You're a better man.	Do bist in better man.
It's so good you're coming.	It is sa goed dat jo komme.
We're going out.	Wy geane út.
And no.	En no.
This way, she said.	Dizze manier, sei se.
Just do not ask how it gets there.	Freegje mar net hoe't it dêr komt.
But no one will believe her.	Mar nimmen sil har leauwe.
I will stop now.	Ik sil no ophâlde.
Do not enter.	Jou net yn.
So you get this.	Sa krije jo dit.
But it was better than that.	Mar it wie better as dat.
We are just finished with food.	Wy binne krekt klear mei iten.
She was a bit of all good.	Se wie in bytsje fan alles goed.
no time out.	gjin tiid út.
I'm not going to school.	Ik gean net nei skoalle.
He needs to be found.	Hy moat fûn wurde.
That's him.	Dat is hy.
They are more than us.	Se binne mear as ús.
It's not my place.	It is net myn plak.
She still loves you.	Se hâldt noch fan dy.
Give me the name now.	Jou my no de namme.
I have a friend who's going through this right now.	Ik haw in freon dy't dêr no troch giet.
The children are	De bern binne
There come.	Der komme.
He wanted even more than he needed to.	Hy woe noch mear as er moast.
I said it.	Ik sei it.
I have no time to do this now.	Ik haw no gjin tiid om dit te dwaan.
They are not who we are.	Se binne net wa't wy binne.
Just my kind of thing.	Krekt myn soarte ding.
Or, it must be so.	Of, it moat sa wêze.
Nothing else matters to him.	Neat oars makket him út.
Had no hand on holding me back.	Hie gjin hân op om my tsjin te hâlden.
I'm glad you're here today.	Ik bin bliid datst hjir hjoed bist.
We would do everything for each other.	Wy soene alles foar elkoar dwaan.
He had to make sure of that.	Hy moast der wis fan meitsje.
All the things that are said against them can be true.	Alle dingen dy't tsjin har sein wurde kinne wier wêze.
That is not true.	Dat is net wier.
That did him good.	Dat hat him goed dien.
For the first time, it works well.	Foar it earst wurket it goed.
Probably not a good idea.	Wierskynlik net in goed idee.
Last year it was nothing.	Ferline jier wie it neat.
And that would be him.	En dat soe him wêze.
I'm working on that too.	Dêr wurkje ik ek oan.
But it's good.	Mar it is goed.
There was nothing else he could do.	Der wie neat oars dat er dwaan koe.
They're coming back.	Se komme werom.
But they need money.	Mar se hawwe jild nedich.
Today is a big day.	Hjoed is in grutte dei.
Or so it seemed.	Of sa like it.
Not with a girl.	Net mei in famke.
She was sure now.	Se wie no wis.
I did not ask and she did not tell me.	Ik frege net en se fertelde my net.
Maybe it can work.	Miskien kin it wurkje.
People want to look like me.	Minsken wolle op my lykje.
My friend's dad died last week.	De heit fan myn freon stoar ferline wike.
Look at this picture.	Sjoch nei dizze foto.
This man likes problems.	Dizze man liket problemen.
I said he was not bad.	Ik sei dat er net min wie.
I'll be nice to him when he's back tomorrow.	Ik sil aardich tsjin him wêze as er moarn werom is.
Do not buy.	Net keapje.
They are not made for that.	Dêr binne se net foar makke.
Either way, it would be trouble if anyone knew.	Hoe dan ek, it soe problemen wêze as immen it wist.
They did not need money.	Se hiene gjin jild nedich.
I have one of them.	Ik haw der ien fan.
She touched it and that was exactly what it felt like.	Se rekke it oan en dat wie krekt wat it fielde.
Not one of us will get the house.	Net ien fan ús sil it hûs krije.
So she looked at it.	Dat se seach der nei.
He found none.	Hy fûn nimmen.
They are the same person.	Se binne deselde persoan.
First one, and then another.	Earst ien, en dan noch ien.
There will be more.	Der sille mear wêze.
But this never happened.	Mar dit is noait bard.
And no matter how often she does, nothing gets better.	En hoe faak oft se ek docht, neat wurdt better.
And you're on.	En do bist oan.
I have seen.	Ik haw wol sjoen.
That was the police.	Dat wie de plysje.
If we know, and can say, then you will know.	As wy witte, en kinne sizze, dan sille jo it witte.
They get things done.	Se krije dingen dien.
This is probably what you want.	Dit is wierskynlik wat jo wolle.
But not really.	Mar eins net.
I do not know what she saw in a guy like me.	Ik wit net wat se seach yn in keardel as my.
Nobody knew much about it.	Nimmen wist der folle fan.
I have been.	Ik haw west.
Buy what you want.	Keapje wat jo wolle.
But he did not want to say it.	Mar hy woe it net sizze.
I will always be one of you.	Ik sil altyd fan dy wêze.
She thought about many things.	Se tocht oer in protte dingen.
Make you have to.	Meitsje jo moatte.
Come with me.	Gean mei my mei.
But he was not ready to give up.	Mar hy wie net ree om op te jaan.
We were pretty surprised.	Wy wiene aardich ferrast.
They are afraid he will tell people what he knows about them.	Se binne bang dat hy minsken fertelle sil wat er oer har wit.
That dog looks very different.	Dy hûn sjocht der hiel oars út.
The book is almost unreadable.	It boek is hast net te lêzen.
I saw nothing.	Ik seach neat.
I will do anything to help you, everything.	Ik sil alles dwaan om jo te helpen, alles.
It was the last thing he had said to his friend.	It wie it lêste wat er tsjin syn freon sein hie.
It could be a day or two.	It koe in dei as twa wêze.
I saw it right now.	Ik seach it no krekt.
I will never make it.	Ik sil it noait meitsje.
It will all be gone by this time next year at this time.	It sil takom jier op dizze tiid allegear fuort wêze.
I will do it next time.	Ik sil it folgjende kear dwaan.
I think this may be the problem.	Ik tink dat dit it probleem kin wêze.
Be careful what you wish for, they say.	Wês foarsichtich wat jo winskje, sizze se.
All this was of course true.	Dit alles wie fansels wier.
There is only one thing to do.	Der is mar ien ding te dwaan.
It would not be too difficult to find him.	It soe net te dreech wêze om him te finen.
That's what the police have to do.	Dat moat de plysje dwaan.
But even this may not be enough.	Mar ek dit kin net genôch wêze.
I'm sick of it.	Ik bin der siik fan.
I was waiting for you.	Ik wachte op dy.
They knew you were coming to this place.	Se wisten dat jo nei dit plak komme soene.
This was no different.	Dizze wie net oars.
And a little.	En in bytsje.
I do not think you told me everything he said.	Ik tink net dat jo my alles ferteld hawwe wat hy sei.
Where were we when.	Wêr wiene wy ​​wannear.
He would have a child.	Hy soe in bern krije.
But what really makes it stand out is its size.	Mar wat it echt makket, is har grutte.
You will also need a car to be sure.	Ek sille jo in auto nedich wêze, om der wis fan te wêzen.
You have to wait another two days.	Jo moatte noch twa dagen wachtsje.
No one at the door.	Gjinien by de doar.
But do it.	Mar doch it.
Not sure sure what you are doing?	Net wis wis wat jo dogge?
Not just in and out.	Net allinnich yn en út.
And it's hard to find.	En it is dreech te finen.
They do not act as.	Se dogge net as.
As if any of that would help.	As soe ien fan dat helpe.
I guess he does not want to tell me.	Ik tink dat hy it my net fertelle wol.
Let me be.	Lit ik wêze.
Well, you're too late.	No, do bist te let.
Everything is fine now.	Alles is no goed.
When she goes to bed.	As se op bêd giet.
It has never happened before or since.	It is noait earder of sûnt bard.
He wanted to go home.	Hy woe nei hûs.
Will show more tomorrow.	Sil moarn mear sjen litte.
That can never be enough.	Dat kin nea genôch wêze.
Not with me on it, on its own.	Net mei my derop, op himsels.
We knew what they were.	Wy wisten wat se wiene.
He would never talk about his past.	Hy soe nea prate oer syn ferline.
Made by his father who is not here.	Makke troch syn heit dy't hjir net is.
Couldn't even say it better.	Koene it sels net better sizze.
You have to get it from them.	Jo moatte it fan har krije.
And there are enough people who want you to do it.	En d'r binne genôch minsken dy't wolle dat jo it dogge.
Nothing came up.	Der kaam neat op.
That is not so clear.	Dat is net sa dúdlik.
She saw a new woman in it.	Se seach der in nije frou yn.
Now things are different.	No binne dingen oars.
That's what they want.	Dat fine se wol.
It may take some time.	It kin in bytsje tiid nimme.
A way out.	In wei út.
Or you can.	Of jo kinne.
Whatever she had done.	Wat se ek dien hie.
What if there was no morning?	Wat as der gjin moarn wie?
Let us see if we can make this work.	Lit ús sjen oft wy kinne meitsje dit wurk.
He had done it himself.	Hy hie it sels dien.
I'm the one.	ik bin de.
Just come in and sit down.	Kom mar yn en sit.
And up and up and up, and through.	En op en op en op, en troch.
And if there is, please let me know.	En as der is, lit it my dan witte.
Of course you have to come tomorrow too.	Fansels moatte jo moarn ek komme.
He will get really good.	Hy sil echt goed wurde.
They go in.	Se geane yn.
I am tired.	Ik bin wurch.
I hope it hurt.	Ik hoopje dat it sear die.
You think everyone is against you.	Jo tinke dat elkenien tsjin jo is.
But before you go, let me tell you something.	Mar foardat jo gean, lit my jo wat fertelle.
Everything was fine, until the last week of the month.	Alles wie goed, oant de lêste wike fan 'e moanne.
I did not.	Ik hie net.
I want to help you.	Ik wol dy helpe.
Do we all agree?	Binne wy ​​it allegear iens?
He showed very good things.	Hy liet heul goede dingen sjen.
You have so much.	Jo hawwe safolle.
I did everything that was expected of me.	Ik haw alles dien wat fan my ferwachte waard.
The same was true for class.	Itselde wie wier foar klasse.
I have so much to tell you.	Ik haw jo safolle te fertellen.
And it gave me hope.	En it joech my hope.
He might want to 'win' by finding me.	Hy soe miskien wol 'winne' troch my te finen.
Time did that.	De tiid die dat.
They could go away.	Se koene fuort.
All you have to do is go there.	Alles wat jo hoege te dwaan is der hinne gean.
There was something else about him.	Der wie wat oars oan him.
I now live in the city.	Ik wenje no yn 'e stêd.
Well, no problem.	No, gjin probleem.
He will want you all for himself.	Hy sil jo allegear foar himsels wolle.
Maybe this happens to both of us.	Miskien bart dit ús beide.
We have no friends here.	Wy hawwe hjir gjin freonen.
Did not know what kind it was.	Wist net hokker soarte it wie.
Maybe that didn’t matter.	Miskien hoegde dat net.
I'm not sure exactly how to do it.	Ik bin der net wis fan krekt hoe te dwaan it.
He admitted to her and let her have what she wanted.	Hy joech har ta en liet har hawwe wat se woe.
Or that's the plan.	Of dat is it plan.
It felt good to eat.	It fielde goed om te iten.
He wants to be free.	Hy wol frij wêze.
Mine was the first.	Myn wie de earste.
And that it went badly.	En dat it min gie.
Let us be who we are.	Lit ús wêze wa't wy binne.
He came home.	Hy kaam thús.
It's both or not.	It is beide of net.
There would have been no place.	Der soe gjin plak west hawwe.
Dad will be so happy to see us there.	Heit sil sa bliid wêze om ús dêr te sjen.
And they do, of course.	En dat dogge se fansels.
I just do not see that happening.	Ik sjoch dat gewoan net barre.
You will not need them.	Jo sille se net nedich hawwe.
We can not wait.	Wy kinne net wachtsje.
None of us want to go through this.	Net ien fan ús wol dit troch gean.
It felt good.	It fielde goed.
We've never seen it.	Wy hawwe it noait sjoen.
I will find time for that.	Dêr sil ik tiid foar fine.
I could not have finished it on time.	Ik koe it net op 'e tiid klear hawwe.
It was a good place to get away from.	It wie in goed plak om wei te kommen.
Not interested in me.	Net ynteressearre yn my.
He was not tired either.	Hy wie ek net wurch.
She had to be told the truth.	Se moast de wierheid ferteld wurde.
That did not seem right.	Dat like net goed.
Be a friend.	Wês in freon.
I did that last year.	Dat die ik ferline jier.
It's bad for you.	It is min foar dy.
That was not his way.	Dat wie syn manier net.
Let's hope you like it.	Litte wy hoopje dat jo it leuk fine.
We know we are beautiful.	Wy witte dat wy moai binne.
But he had no idea why this was so.	Mar hy hie gjin idee fan wêrom't dit sa wie.
If he still had.	As er noch hie.
People say what they want.	Minsken sizze wat se wolle.
He is very nice.	Hy is heul aardich.
I'm so happy.	Ik bin sa bliid.
It has not always been easy.	It hat net altyd maklik west.
What you do not have to worry about.	Wat jo moatte gjin soargen.
And it's not people you want to find.	En it binne net minsken dy't jo jo fine wolle.
I never went again.	Ik gie nea wer.
I would have.	Ik soe hawwe.
He is no longer a child.	Hy is gjin bern mear.
But they knew.	Mar se wisten.
And this has its place.	En dit har plak.
You can have these with me.	Jo kinne dizze by my hawwe.
I had seen how he felt about her.	Ik hie sjoen hoe't er oer har fielde.
I had a picture, and that was it.	Ik hie in foto, en dat wie it.
This book is different.	Dit boek is oars.
And it does not matter to him.	En it makket him neat út.
He knows me.	Hy ken my.
Anyone who has an idea.	Elkenien dy't in idee hat.
I'm sure it was you.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it jo wie.
It almost felt like home.	It fielde hast as thús.
There are no words.	Der binne gjin wurden.
He had other problems.	Hy hie oare problemen.
You just can not talk to the man.	Jo kinne gewoan net mei de man prate.
Let's see what's in here.	Litte wy sjen wat hjir yn stiet.
She will never be there again.	Se sil der noait wer wêze.
But there was nothing.	Mar dêr wie neat.
She felt pretty good.	Se fielde har aardich goed.
She herself did not know why she did this.	Se sels wist net wêrom't se dit die.
I did not ask you to do that!	Ik haw dy net frege om dat te dwaan!
Everyone looked.	Elkenien seach.
There are so many.	Der binne safolle.
They have to find another way.	Se moatte in oare manier fine.
And got the food, the same as always.	En it iten krige, itselde as altyd.
I did not like that.	Dat mocht ik net.
That hurt too.	Dat die ek sear.
She would find them.	Se soe se fine.
Wants to come here.	Wol hjir komme.
But none of us really knew where we were going.	Mar net ien fan ús wist echt wêr't wy yn wiene.
They were just good friends.	Se wiene gewoan goede freonen.
You know how good it was.	Jo witte hoe goed it wie.
He said so much.	Hy hat safolle sein.
I do not know where it came from.	Ik wit net wêr't it wei kaam.
That was all he needed.	Dat wie alles wat er nedich hie.
But the words were not there.	Mar de wurden wiene der net.
Let's really be here.	Litte wy hjir echt wêze.
Let's do it right.	Litte wy it goed dwaan.
I do not want that anymore.	Dat wol ik net mear.
I still have a chance.	Ik ha noch in kâns.
It's ready to drive home today !.	It is hjoed klear om nei hûs te riden!.
She has a way with words.	Se hat in manier mei wurden.
She needed the work.	Se hie it wurk nedich.
She gave it to me.	Se joech it oan my.
You need to be ready.	Jo moatte klear wêze.
They had an idea.	Se hiene in idee.
That he you who the.	Dat hy jo dy't de.
And it goes on.	En it giet troch.
They could keep it forever.	Se koene it foar altyd hâlde.
What she would say.	Wat se soe sizze.
I had nothing to say.	Ik hie neat te sizzen.
I had no reason to stop.	Ik hie gjin reden om te hâlden.
She had not told anyone why, and no one knew.	Se hie gjinien ferteld wêrom, en gjinien wist.
But she said nothing.	Mar se sei neat.
He did not need children.	Hy hie gjin bern nedich.
But this does not hold.	Mar dit hâldt net.
I'll have to do something.	Ik sil wat dwaan moatte.
All the same.	Allegear itselde.
We have more than that to do.	Wy hawwe mear as dat te dwaan.
He had never seen it before.	Dy hie er noch nea earder sjoen.
Please wait for me.	Wachtsje mar, asjebleaft, foar my.
We can see how it works.	Wy kinne sjen hoe't it wurket.
I know a good place.	Ik wit in goed plak.
He looked around.	Hy seach om.
This is due to one or both of two things.	Dit komt troch ien of beide fan twa dingen.
I do not know why we are here.	Ik wit net wêrom wy hjir binne.
I did not know.	Ik wist it net.
Today, there are none.	Hjoed, der binne gjin.
I was worried about her.	Ik wie soargen oer har.
She was not sure what to do next.	Se wie der net wis fan wat se dan dwaan moast.
He really is more than a father.	Hy is echt mear as in heit.
That is not true.	Dat is net wier.
But there was really nothing for it.	Mar der wie wier neat foar.
Or so we think.	Of sa tinke wy.
Things will find us.	Dingen sille ús fine.
It's the same here.	It is hjir itselde.
With a man.	Mei in man.
He makes enough money.	Hy makket genôch jild.
That could not.	Dat koe net.
And there's another person in the room.	En der is in oare persoan yn 'e keamer.
And it's wrong.	En it is ferkeard.
He had heard it before.	Hy hie it earder heard.
I may not be feeling well.	Ik haw it miskien net goed.
He had to go to jail.	Hy moast nei de finzenis.
This book was a good read.	Dit boek wie in goed lêzen.
Of course I can not tell you that.	Dat kin ik dy fansels net sizze.
Somehow he always does.	Op ien of oare manier docht er dat altyd.
It's wrong.	It is ferkeard.
When the food was all gone, we had nothing left.	Doe't it iten wie allegear fuort, wy hiene neat mear.
If it works.	As it wurket.
They do not like each other much.	Se hâlde net folle fan elkoar.
He felt sick.	Hy fielde him siik.
I just know it's beautiful here.	Ik wit gewoan dat it hjir moai is.
We can do nothing.	Wy kinne neat dwaan.
What do you think of the house?	Wat fine jo fan it hûs?
He had it coming.	Hy hie it kommen.
Well, that's not true.	No, dat is net wier.
I knew it well.	Ik wist it goed.
But you, you make me happy.	Mar jo, jo meitsje my bliid.
That we are a family.	Dat wy in famylje binne.
I would never pay anyone to do those things for me.	Ik soe noait ien betelje om dy dingen foar my te dwaan.
The child had never heard this before.	It bern hie dit noch nea heard.
Do not try to become something.	Besykje net wat te wurden.
I often arrive late for dinner.	Ik kom faak te let foar it iten.
Everything he needed.	Alles wat er nedich hie.
We no longer believe him.	Wy leauwe him net mear.
I was expecting it.	Ik hie it ferwachte.
Wherever she was, they were not.	Wêr't se ek wie, wiene se net.
Give it thirty days.	Jou it tritich dagen.
We have made this clear.	Wy hawwe dit dúdlik makke.
Now the word was out.	No wie it wurd út.
I had to leave the house.	Ik moast it hûs út.
But it's something, maybe.	Mar it is wat, miskien.
I'm telling you.	Ik fertel it dy.
I do not want to worry about who my husband is.	Ik wol net soargen meitsje oer wa't myn man is.
The parents were happy.	De âlden wiene bliid.
I could handle that.	Dat koe ik wol oan.
What was that? 	Wat wie dat?
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
I love her a lot.	Ik hâld fan har in protte.
For one thing, it's a lot of work.	Foar ien ding is it in protte wurk.
He will return when he returns.	Hy komt werom as er werom komt.
You do not want this to happen.	Jo wolle net dat dit alles bart.
She felt the same about me.	Se fielde itselde oer my.
People were at his house for a party.	Minsken wiene by him thús foar in feest.
You have worked so hard.	Jo hawwe sa hurd wurke.
Who knew he had one.	Wa wist dat er ien hie.
She could have it another day.	Se koe it noch in dei hawwe.
You knew your way.	Jo wisten jo wei.
I would talk to you about it.	Ik soe der mei dy oer prate.
It's very difficult.	It is hiel dreech.
She had to tell what she knew.	Se moast fertelle wat se wist.
It does not work as well as you might think.	It wurket net sa goed as jo miskien tinke.
She was too scared to talk.	Se wie te bang om te praten.
It does not even say that she did not.	It seit net iens dat se it net die.
Maybe it's better to say he felt it.	Miskien is it better om te sizzen dat er it fielde.
I have no idea what they are.	Ik ha gjin idee wat se binne.
I looked back.	Ik seach werom.
Friends tell each other everything.	Freonen fertelle elkoar alles.
There will be enough opportunity for that.	Dêr sil kâns genôch foar wêze.
What happens happens.	Wat bart bart.
They took care of her.	Se soargen foar har.
She had to go home.	Se moast nei hûs.
Now he knew what that was.	No wist er wat dat wat wie.
You would have been the first to know.	Do hiest de earste west dy't it wist.
He was not real.	Hy wie net echt.
They are no longer mine.	Se binne net mear fan my.
But he could talk.	Mar hy koe prate.
I'll be waiting for you, here.	Ik sil op dy wachtsje, hjir.
I'll let you know how it goes.	Ik sil jo witte hoe't it giet.
Never been, would never be.	Nea west, soe nea wêze.
But not the past.	Mar net it ferline.
She was just glad he was there.	Se wie gewoan bliid dat er der wie.
I did not have to worry.	Ik hie gjin soargen moatten.
Really, it is.	Echt, it is.
You do not have to worry about it.	Jo hoege jo gjin soargen te meitsjen.
And now he does.	En no docht er dat.
These days we know so much more.	Dizze dagen witte wy safolle mear.
She had been careful.	Se hie foarsichtich west.
The problem is, someone did.	It probleem is, immen die.
I still have a lot to say.	Ik haw noch in protte te sizzen.
He had been talking all the way here.	Hy hie hjir de hiele wei praat.
He does and says the things you think.	Hy docht en seit de dingen dy't jo tinke.
What he says is so.	Wat er seit is sa.
No one will think you're good enough.	Nimmen sil tinke dat jo goed genôch binne.
Help can come.	Der kin help komme.
I know she was.	Ik wit dat se wie.
No one can tell it what to do.	Nimmen kin it fertelle wat te dwaan.
He knew your name.	Hy wist dyn namme.
Your kids know.	Jo bern witte.
My first in three years.	Myn earste yn trije jier.
But there is none.	Mar der is gjinien.
It looks very nice.	It sjocht der hiel moai út.
To have without holding.	Te hawwen sûnder hâlden.
Someone came to the door.	Der kaam ien by de doar.
I am him.	Ik bin him.
I'll look after you.	Ik sil nei dy sjen.
I know you did a job.	Ik wit dat jo in baan diene.
She's not better.	Se is net better.
The next thing to find money.	De folgjende ding te finen jild.
He's there.	Hy is der.
Why would they.	Wêrom soene se.
This is not true at all.	Dit is hielendal net wier.
How it goes.	Hoe't it giet.
In life, there are always people who try to help.	Yn it libben binne d'r altyd minsken dy't besykje te helpen.
Is that really something.	Is dat echt wat.
I'm sure she should not.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se net moat.
He felt old.	Hy fielde him âld.
This is nice, is not it?	Dit is moai, is it net?
And it was not the first.	En it wie net de earste.
I do not believe you think so.	Ik leau net dat jo dat tinke.
Of course he could not.	Fansels koe er net.
We should not take anything for granted.	Wy moatte neat foar fansels nimme.
You have to go and ask them.	Jo moatte gean en freegje se.
This is not the time to talk about this.	It is net de tiid om hjir no oer te praten.
I would not try it again.	Ik soe it net wer besykje.
But what has happened has happened.	Mar wat der bard is, is bard.
We all had jobs.	Wy hiene allegear wurk.
They could not do any wrong.	Se koene gjin ferkeard dwaan.
He lives alone.	Hy wennet allinnich.
You got through it then.	Do hast it dan troch.
It's not always what seems clear.	It is net altyd wat dúdlik liket.
He probably has not read everything.	Hy hat wierskynlik net alles lêzen.
I know how he works.	Ik wit hoe't hy wurket.
It's different for everyone.	It is foar elkenien oars.
He would need me.	Hy soe my nedich hawwe.
Nothing in and nothing out.	Neat yn en neat út.
There was work to be done.	Der wie wurk te dwaan.
I really can not tell.	Ik kin it echt net fertelle.
It all looks pretty well done.	It sjocht der allegear aardich goed dien út.
Without being asked.	Sûnder frege te wurden.
It would come in two days.	It soe oer twa dagen komme.
He would never have them.	Hy soe se nea hawwe.
And he came and you know.	En hy kaam en jo witte.
I can see why you keep it long.	Ik kin sjen wêrom't jo it lang hâlde.
The two are always together.	De twa binne altyd tegearre.
The old man wants us to wait right here.	De âld man wol dat wy hjir krekt wachtsje.
See the words !.	Sjoch de wurden!.
He will not hurt anyone else.	Hy sil gjinien oars sear dwaan.
There was a young man from my town.	Der wie in jonge man út myn stêd.
We can not know.	Wy kinne net witte.
You are for me.	Do bist foar my.
It's time to have kids.	Der is tiid om bern te hawwen.
It's not bad.	It is net min.
It should be soon though.	It moat wol gau.
No one else knew about the child so far.	Nimmen oars wist fan it bern oant no ta.
I should know.	Ik soe it witte moatte.
They were really into it.	Se wiene der echt yn.
And never do this again.	En doch dit noait wer.
We probably will not.	Wy sille wierskynlik net.
Everything was just off for the guy.	Alles wie krekt ôf foar de keardel.
This is what happens.	Dit is wat der bart.
It's good fun.	It is goed leuk.
It was the best ever.	It wie de bêste ea.
Give it another go.	Jou it noch in kear.
Now still the same.	No noch altyd itselde.
This is difficult.	Dit is dreech.
Let me tell you this.	Lit my dy dit fertelle.
So it is.	Sa is dit.
But he was the same man he is today.	Mar hy wie deselde man dy't hy hjoed is.
Everything seemed so hard.	Alles like sa hurd.
He's at school.	Hy is op skoalle.
Just think when you need to.	Tink gewoan as jo nedich binne.
He left again after a few hours.	Hy gie nei in pear oeren wer fuort.
They will tell us where we need to go.	Se sille ús fertelle wêr't wy hinne moatte.
What city is this?	Hokker stêd is dit?
Whatever it does.	Wat it ek docht.
It should be a better plan than what you do now.	It moat in better plan wêze dan wat jo no dogge.
Good for me.	Goed foar my.
She will have to stop having a baby, soon.	Se sil moatte ophâlde in bern, gau.
In fact, every now and then, there is only one guy.	Eins is it sa no en dan mar ien keardel.
That's what you need to see.	Dat moatte jo sjen.
Came from there.	Dêr wei kaam.
I'm not talking to anyone about what you did.	Ik praat der mei gjinien oer, wat jo dien hawwe.
Everything seemed to be fine.	Alles like goed te wêzen.
No one knows when.	Nimmen wit wannear.
You do not have that either.	Dat hawwe jo ek net.
You just do not do it.	Jo dogge it gewoan net.
We can not stay here.	Wy kinne hjir net bliuwe.
I stayed there.	Ik bleau der by.
And take it one day at a time.	En nim it ien dei op in tiid.
They are so good.	Se binne sa goed.
Since they were children.	Sûnt se bern wiene.
We get there.	Wy komme dêr.
We must first not say them.	Wy moatte de earste sizze net se.
We need to talk about this.	Wy moatte dit oer prate.
The woman looks at you.	De frou sjocht dy oan.
She had enough time to find another man.	Se hie genôch tiid om in oare man te finen.
But there was this other girl too.	Mar dêr wie ek dit oare famke.
None of us have ever done that.	Net ien fan ús hat dat ea dien.
To his house after school.	Nei syn hûs nei skoalle.
He put himself into his work.	Hy sette him yn syn wurk.
Your mother should come home soon.	Jo mem soe gau thús komme moatte.
Tell me why.	Fertel my wêrom.
I did not want to think about being sick.	Ik woe net tinke oer siik wêze.
A man without her is a man without hope.	In man sûnder har is in man sûnder hope.
But she could see nothing.	Mar se koe neat sjen.
Come to us if you can.	Kom nei ús as jo kinne.
She came to me.	Se kaam by my.
He left at the first opportunity.	Hy liet by de earste kâns.
I think we're fine.	Ik tink dat wy it goed hawwe.
And maybe more.	En miskien mear.
Everything that happens will happen twice.	Alles wat bart sil twa kear barre.
Wait for it to go to the right place.	Wachtsje dat it nei it goede plak giet.
She's fine.	Se is wol goed.
If there are people.	As der minsken binne.
Her next word is not.	Har folgjende wurd is net.
I did it wrong.	Ik die it ferkeard.
I was not sure it was good for her.	Ik wie net wis dat it goed wie foar har.
These have begun to show.	Dizze binne begûn te sjen.
So many, and we do not know what they are.	Safolle, en wy witte net wat se binne.
I came here by bus.	Ik kaam hjir mei de bus.
There is one now.	Der is no ien.
The following will not be.	De folgjende sil net wêze.
That did not do it.	Dat hat it net dien.
How can I go about this.	Hoe kin ik gean oer dit.
I would be out of the way.	Ik soe út 'e wei wêze.
This seemed to make it better.	Dit like it better te meitsjen.
I did not like that at all.	Dat mocht ik hielendal net.
There's just nothing.	Der is gewoan neat.
Not my father.	Net myn heit.
You will soon see that someone.	Jo sille gau sjen dat immen.
But nothing more.	Mar neat mear.
He said 'probably not'.	Hy sei 'wierskynlik net'.
She did not interest me.	Se ynteressearre my net.
It's who he is.	It is wa't hy is.
They were here, now they are not.	Se wiene hjir, no binne se net.
Everyone got the same opportunity.	Elkenien krige deselde kâns.
Anyway, she went through.	Hoe dan ek, se gie troch.
Feel it.	Fiel it.
I'm afraid there's just one.	Ik bin bang dat der krekt ien is.
This he had not expected, from the young girl.	Dit hie er net ferwachte, fan it jonge famke.
But, she was very worried.	Mar, se wie tige soargen.
The more people who talk about it, the better.	Hoe mear minsken dy't der oer prate, hoe better.
And it was more than that.	En it wie mear as dat.
There's a girl.	Der is in famke.
If he has no money, he can not pay.	As er gjin jild hat, kin er net betelje.
The man had nothing to do with it.	De man hie der neat fan.
The children have left school.	De bern binne fan skoalle ôf gien.
We were three hours away.	Wy wiene trije oeren fuort.
By tonight, if that is possible.	Tsjin fannacht, as dat kin.
That's the truth.	Dat is de wierheid.
When you were gone.	Doe't jo fuort wiene.
Over everything.	Oer alles hinne.
This does work though.	Dit wurket wol.
Now he was gone too.	No wie er ek fuort.
But if they go, they can never go back.	Mar as se geane, kinne se noait werom.
I love talking to my kids in the car.	Ik hâld fan praten mei myn bern yn 'e auto.
No way out, no way home.	Gjin wei út, gjin wei nei hûs.
He does not want to return.	Hy wol net werom.
It should not have been so.	It hie net sa wêze moatten.
You can see that.	Jo kinne dat sjen.
I just had a good time.	Ik moast it krekt goed tiid.
It had to do two more things.	It moast noch twa dingen dwaan.
Stop it now, children!	Hâld no op, bern!
Comes on a day like this.	Komt op in dei as dizze.
We were very surprised by this.	Wy wiene tige ferrast troch dit.
Once again, they were too late.	Noch ien kear wiene se te let.
It looked like it had not been there for a long time.	It like der op dat it der al lang net mear west hie.
We were different.	Wy wiene oars.
He said he was interested.	Hy sei dat er ynteressearre wie.
He was beautiful.	Hy wie moai.
In my room.	Yn myn keamer.
You better get back here now.	Jo kinne hjir better no werom komme.
But he did not look at it.	Mar hy seach der net nei.
This was no longer true.	Dit wie net mear wier.
Be sure to tell us how good we are.	Wês wis dat jo ús fertelle hoe goed wy binne.
And you have to do that.	En dat moatte jo dwaan.
I thought no one around me knew.	Ik tocht dat nimmen om my hinne wist.
She told me to get back to bed.	Se fertelde my kom werom op bêd.
I'll talk to you soon.	Ik sil gau mei dy prate.
Get off there.	Kom der ôf.
That day never came.	Dy dei kaam noait.
He kept telling the truth.	Hy bleau de wierheid fertelle.
He really was there.	Hy wie der echt.
That's what they should do.	Dat moatte se dwaan.
I'm tired of driving so far.	Ik bin wurch fan it riden oant no ta.
This makes me a we now.	Dit makket my no in wy.
I just wanted you to know that it's okay to do that.	Ik woe gewoan dat jo witte dat it goed is om dat te dwaan.
I try.	Ik besykje.
I can not agree with you.	Ik kin net iens mei dy prate.
No one pays attention, he said to himself.	Nimmen let op, sei er tsjin himsels.
I need to see her.	Ik moat har sjen.
You do not know what is happening.	Jo witte net wat der bart.
That's the last thing he wants.	Dat is it lêste wat er wol.
And we need another.	En wy hawwe in oare nedich.
I need nothing more.	Ik haw neat mear nedich.
He looked at the door.	Hy seach nei de doar.
It seems.	It liket.
Or maybe it happened.	Of miskien is it bard.
But he always came back.	Mar hy kaam altyd werom.
It has been very common so far.	It is oant no ta hiel gewoan west.
But he's fine with it now.	Mar hy is der no goed mei.
I have to go into town for a meeting.	Ik moat de stêd yn foar in gearkomste.
He's just there.	Hy is der gewoan.
I can not look at it.	Ik kin der net nei sjen.
So is the man.	Sa is de man.
They always think that something is better.	Se tinke altyd dat wat better is.
When it gets tough, it gets tough.	As it dreech wurdt, komt it dreech.
Stick to the plan.	Hâld by it plan.
We can not pay it.	Wy kinne it net betelje.
I knew how.	Ik wist hoe.
We can not say exactly what they will do then.	Wy kinne net krekt sizze wat se dan sille dwaan.
I asked who it was.	Ik frege wa't it wie.
From there, they would be able to get it out.	Dêr soene se it út kinne.
Have you thought about what you would say?	Hawwe jo tocht oer wat jo soene sizze?
Here's a better one.	Hjir is in bettere.
That's one reason why he should not be here.	Dat is ien reden wêrom't hy hjir net wêze soe.
He was a bad man.	Hy wie in min man.
We are not talking.	Wy prate net.
As if he was waiting for us.	As hie er op ús wachte.
But know this.	Mar wit dit.
This must have been his office.	Dizze moat syn kantoar west hawwe.
I will do everything for you if you want.	Ik sil alles foar jo dwaan as jo wolle.
The first day no one saw the letter.	De earste dei seach gjinien de brief.
Maybe he could just now.	Miskien koe er no mar .
A story.	In fertel.
I had to see you.	Ik moast dy sjen.
I never expected this to happen.	Ik hie nea ferwachte dat dit soe barre.
I do not want to talk about him.	Ik wol net oer him prate.
We'll wait a few more days.	Wy wachtsje noch in pear dagen.
I could be wrong though.	Ik koe wol ferkeard wêze.
And here.	En hjir.
But they did not say much.	Mar se seine net folle.
Never too late.	Nea te let.
This has happened too often for us to love you.	Dit is te faak bard foar ús om jo te hâlden.
Now we knew why.	No wisten wy wêrom.
I really did not want to go.	Ik woe echt net gean.
She had heard this.	Se hie dit heard.
I knew there was something.	Ik wist dat der wat wie.
In a bad way.	Op in minne manier.
Maybe she was scared of him.	Miskien wie se bang foar him.
But try it and see how much it can help you.	Mar besykje it en sjoch hoefolle it jo kin helpe.
We can of course see how this happened.	Wy kinne fansels sjen hoe't dit barde.
She's coming back.	Se komt werom.
A beautiful house.	In moai hûs.
She told us she knew nothing.	Se fertelde ús dat se neat wist.
She could, did not want to, help her friend.	Se koe, woe net, har freon helpe.
Well, of course, they would.	No, fansels, se soene.
We are ready for it.	Wy binne der klear foar.
He did not know what was happening right now.	Hy wist net wat der no krekt barde.
Two for you.	Twa foar dy.
Lately, people have started driving more.	De lêste tiid binne minsken mear begûn te riden.
So it works here.	Sa wurket it hjir.
She was not sure why she would come.	Se wie net wis wêrom't se komme soe.
I think a lot of people don’t get the book.	Ik tink dat in protte minsken it boek net krije.
And he could do nothing about it.	En dêr koe er neat oan dwaan.
You do not know what is there.	Jo witte net wat der is.
When it's gone, it's gone.	As it fuort is, is it fuort.
Do the other thing.	Doch it oare ding.
We are ready to give our word.	Wy binne ree om ús wurd oer te jaan.
She was not sick.	Se wie net siik.
Of course there is that.	Fansels is der dat.
I do not feel bad enough.	Ik fiel my net min genôch.
You can do better than that.	Jo kinne better dwaan as dat.
I'm sure they had no idea what to do.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se gjin idee hiene wat te dwaan.
Today will be the last of my days.	Hjoed sil dit de lêste fan myn dagen wêze.
Or you too, get there.	Of jo ek, kom dêr ta.
A few of us can do without a car.	In pear fan ús kinne sûnder in auto.
Enough to go away.	Genôch om fuort te gean.
I need you back.	Ik moat dy werom ha.
I was not surprised.	Ik wie net ferrast.
It will help you to get a job.	It sil jo helpe om wurk te krijen.
He always did what he thought was best for me.	Hy hat altyd dien wat hy tocht dat it bêste foar my wie.
He worked with no one.	Hy wurke mei gjinien.
I take it back and give something else.	Ik nim it werom en jou wat oars.
Caution.	Foarsichtich.
I am easily convinced.	Ik bin maklik oertsjûge.
I would go to work.	Ik soe oan it wurk.
And they tell each other everything.	En se fertelle elkoar alles.
But she wanted more.	Mar se woe mear.
He did not think so, he said.	Dat tocht er net, sei er.
She was first in her class.	Se wie earste yn har klasse.
There is only so much you can do.	D'r is mar safolle dat jo kinne dwaan.
But again, none of this happened.	Mar wer barde neat fan dit.
Maybe they’ve had enough.	Miskien hawwe se genôch hân.
He was the best, and he knew it.	Hy wie de bêste, en hy wist it.
It's actually very nice.	It is eins hiel moai.
And we leave it there.	En wy litte it dêr fuort.
That was probably good, but it did not feel good.	Dat wie wierskynlik goed, mar it fielde net goed.
I've never met him.	Ik haw him noch noait moete.
Everyone stop talking.	Elkenien hâlde op mei praten.
Well, it looks bad.	No, it sjocht der min út.
I know it will happen.	Ik wit dat it barre sil.
He had no problem with that.	Dêr hie er gjin probleem mei.
I'm going now.	Ik gean no.
What we say, together.	Wat wy sizze, tegearre.
But he was not awake.	Mar hy wie net wekker.
I love that kid.	Ik hâld fan dat bern.
Anything else.	Allegear wat dan ek.
In fact, no one was entirely happy with it.	Eins wie nimmen der hielendal bliid mei.
You do not need much.	Jo hawwe net folle nedich.
You will not see much of them now.	Jo sille no net folle fan har sjen.
Now that was gone.	No wie dat fuort.
They want to see it.	Se wolle it sjen.
No one else liked her.	Nimmen oars like har.
More than happy.	Mear dan bliid.
It was good to see.	It wie goed om te sjen.
We're still working.	Wy wurkje noch.
I told your father.	Ik fertelde jo heit.
We will give them what they want.	Wy sille har jaan wat se wolle.
He told me he had to go back to her.	Hy fertelde my dat er werom moast nei har.
All were better than nothing.	Allegear wiene better as neat.
But they knew better.	Mar se wisten better.
He was a friend of mine.	Hy wie in freon fan my.
It did not seem right to us at all.	It like ús hielendal net goed.
He could take it for granted.	Hy koe it foar fansels nimme.
All they need is food.	Alles wat se nedich binne is iten.
He has a family.	Hy hat in famylje.
Take me now.	Nim my no.
I'll try.	Ik sil it besykje.
It would be nice to buy just one thing.	It soe moai wêze om mar ien ding te keapjen.
It was soon to be seen.	It wie al gau te sjen.
Make them one by one.	Meitsje se ien foar ien.
As if he had the place.	As hie er it plak.
I really did.	Ik echt die.
This is certainly true for humans.	Dit is wis wier foar minsken.
I heard you say something.	Ik hearde jo wat sizze.
All this here.	Dit alles hjir.
So we now know what happens.	Sa witte wy no wat der bart.
If you have more questions, please ask.	As jo ​​​​mear fragen hawwe, freegje dan.
I know better.	Ik wit better.
They go home and eat food.	Se geane nei hûs en ite iten.
Out of.	Sûnder.
Now he does not want it at all.	No wol er it hielendal net.
I had to do something to him.	Ik moast wat oan him dwaan.
They both worry and go on with their day.	Se meitsje har beide soargen en geane troch mei har dei.
Leave it at that.	Lit it der by.
That's what we're talking about here.	Dat is wêr't wy it hjir oer hawwe.
I've already tried it.	Ik haw it al besocht.
There is a way to do both.	D'r is in manier om beide te dwaan.
We're just over it.	Wy binne der krekt oer.
do not be afraid.	wês net bang.
She did not want to be her mother and father.	Se woe net har mem en heit wêze.
He must be here very soon.	Hy moat hjir hiel gau wêze.
The city is.	De stêd is.
You know you want to !.	Jo witte dat jo wolle!.
He could not speak for another hour.	Hy koe gjin oere mear prate.
He is a bit round, but nice.	Hy is in bytsje rûn, mar moai.
That's what I said to him.	Dat sei ik tsjin him.
The problem was, he did not know what to do.	It probleem wie, hy wist net wat te dwaan.
He did not have a car.	Hy hie gjin auto.
He knew that.	Dat wist er.
I was just in time!	Ik wie krekt op tiid!
I have a plan.	Ik haw in plan.
You do it better.	Jo dogge it better.
And that's good.	En dat is goed.
He had to stop.	Hy moast ophâlde.
We all need it.	Wy binne allegear nedich.
It did very well.	It die hiel goed.
They said it would not be a problem.	Se seine dat it gjin probleem wêze soe.
But he has worked really hard.	Mar hy hat echt hurd wurke.
Let us not hope.	Lit ús hoopje net.
Well, let's see.	No, lit se.
I do not know about that.	Dêr wit ik net fan.
I hope you believe that.	Ik hoopje dat jo dat leauwe.
I was not sure which one.	Ik wie net wis hokker.
Looks good on you.	Sjocht der goed út op dy.
Now we just have to go and do it.	No moatte wy gewoan gean en it dwaan.
That was nice to see.	Dat wie moai om te sjen.
Not a bad idea at all.	Gjin min idee hielendal.
They put them through me.	Se sette har troch my.
I need.	Ik haw nedich.
She looked at me.	Se seach nei my.
We never know what will happen.	Wy witte noait wat der barre sil.
There will be no problems.	D'r sille gjin problemen wêze.
He seemed tired.	Hy like wurch.
We have you.	Wy hawwe dy.
He knew what he wanted.	Hy wist wat er woe.
They were also very good.	Se wiene ek hiel goed.
He does not speak back.	Hy praat net werom.
Go see him.	Gean him sjen.
I just wanted to be a kid.	Ik woe gewoan in bern wêze.
I did more.	Ik die mear.
They do not think about them.	Se tinke net oer har.
There were many more people than usual.	Der wiene folle mear minsken as oars.
If not, it should show nothing.	As net, dan moat it neat sjen litte.
You can also do this easily in a bowl by hand.	Jo kinne dit ek maklik yn in kom mei de hân dwaan.
He expected nothing more from life.	Hy ferwachte neat mear fan it libben.
Maybe it’s caution, more than worrying.	Miskien is it foarsichtich, mear as soargen.
It's all up to you.	It is allegear oan jo.
I can not talk about that.	Dêr kin ik net oer prate.
They should have the latter, always.	Se moatte it lêste ha, altyd.
What we do is no different.	Wat wy dogge is net oars.
That he knew for sure.	Dat wist er foar wis.
We win it.	Wy winne it.
Maybe that was true.	Miskien wie dat wier.
The dog had been the only one at home.	De hûn hie de ienige thús west.
It would actually be pretty easy.	It soe eins frij maklik wêze.
He seemed to wake him up.	Hy like him wekker te meitsjen.
You can not make them really happy.	Jo kinne se net echt bliid meitsje.
There is no one to help us.	D'r is gjinien om ús te helpen.
It only gets better.	It wurdt allinnich mar better.
You're such a good boy.	Do bist sa'n goede jonge.
Well, it's up to you.	No, it is oan jo.
You say you probably would not like me.	Jo sizze dat jo wierskynlik net fan my hâlde soene.
They had no children, only each other.	Se hiene gjin bern, allinnich elkoar.
Now he works for our man.	No wurket er foar ús man.
You can not have that.	Dat kinne jo net hawwe.
He says he has not been in any other trouble.	Hy seit dat er net yn oare problemen west hat.
And do it for real.	En doch it foar echt.
You are nobody.	Jo binne gjin nimmen.
It had been there three years.	It hie der trije jier west.
We will be friends.	Wy sille freonen wêze.
It's not about me.	It giet net oer my.
Well, he was here for her, in a way.	No, hy wie hjir foar har, op in manier.
If not really know about us.	As net fan ús echt witte.
And he makes it very clear.	En hy makket it hiel dúdlik.
I did not go to school.	Ik gie net nei skoalle.
I can be.	Ik kin wêze.
To get ready.	Om klear te meitsjen.
It did him a lot of good.	In protte goed die it him.
He would know what happened.	Hy soe witte wat der barde.
I should get used to it.	Ik soe hjir wol oan wenne moatte.
Look at these three kids doing work.	Sjoch nei dizze trije bern dy't wurk dogge.
Be carefull!	Wês foarsichtich!
Or not, leave me more to get to.	Of net, lit my mear oer om te krijen.
I have not seen him since.	Ik haw him sûnt net sjoen.
This should work.	Dit moat wurkje.
You will love the book forever.	Jo hâlde fan it boek foar altyd.
He is with us.	Hy is by ús.
He's been here just over a year.	Hy hat hjir krekt mear as in jier west.
You can keep it if you want.	Jo kinne it hâlde as jo wolle.
But not you, boy.	Mar dy net, jonge.
He's such a good guy.	Hy is sa'n goede keardel.
I would never say never.	Ik soe nea nea sizze.
You have to go to him.	Jo moatte nei him ta.
There is no other time where you can get that.	D'r is gjin oare tiid wêr't jo dat krije kinne.
Never tried, either.	Nea waard besocht, ek.
He asked himself.	Hy frege him ôf.
As if he needed more than.	As soe er mear nedich wêze as.
She will always try to have the last word.	Se sil altyd besykje it lêste wurd te hawwen.
I do not know anything else.	Ik wit net wat oars.
I walked back a bit to see where he was.	Ik rûn in bytsje werom om te sjen wêr't er wie.
She did not look at him.	Se seach him net oan.
And it occurred to me that this might be a better place.	En it kaam yn my op dat dit miskien in better plak wie.
But he knew who she was.	Mar hy wist wa't se wie.
That can be difficult.	Dat kin dreech wurde.
About.	Oer.
.	.
That was not easy, let me tell you.	Dat wie net maklik, lit ik dy sizze.
I do not even know who you are.	Ik wit net iens wa't jo binne.
I'm busy.	Ik ha it wol drok.
But we do not know.	Mar dat witte wy net.
We'm sorry.	It spyt ús.
He just did not eat at home.	Hy hie gewoan net thús iten.
I can not believe she's really mine.	Ik kin net leauwe dat se echt fan my is.
Enough was enough.	Genôch wie genôch.
Well, a lot like that.	No, in protte sa.
Or both of us.	Of ús beide.
Is this what is happening to us now.	Is dit wat ús no bart.
So they could see them too.	Sa koene se se ek sjen.
The hand that still worked.	De hân dy't noch wurke.
The first thing it ever said to her.	It earste wat it oait tsjin har sei.
It eats you up.	It yt dy op.
It's nice to get out of the house.	It is moai om it hûs út te kommen.
He never came out.	Hy kaam noait út.
I have decided, says the man.	Ik haw my besletten, seit de man.
We need to get to bed early.	Wy moatte betiid op bêd.
There is no telling.	Der is gjin fertellen.
But you know it's happening.	Mar jo witte dat it bart.
It's nothing of the sort.	It is neat fan it soarte.
I would do anything for you.	Ik soe alles foar dy dwaan.
I never went back.	Ik gie nea werom.
They had me and they knew it.	Se hiene my en se wisten it.
It was my first.	It wie myn earste.
You should have time.	Jo soene tiid hawwe.
Do not worry about him, it's going well.	Sit gjin soargen oer him, it komt goed.
She really saw him.	Se seach him wier.
And you have to go home to bed.	En jo moatte nei hûs op bêd.
You need to be careful about what you eat.	Jo moatte foarsichtich wêze oer wat jo ite.
The children love their mother.	De bern hâlde fan har mem.
He said absolutely nothing.	Hy sei hielendal neat.
They like to live alone.	Se wenje graach allinnich.
It's happening, man.	It bart, man.
She is very.	Se is heul.
They want something different.	Se wolle wat oars.
That happened.	Dat is bard.
He can not help it.	Hy kin it net helpe.
We have no idea how it got there.	Wy hawwe gjin idee hoe't it dêr kaam.
And they did not.	En dat diene se net.
You have a lot of money.	Jo hawwe in protte jild.
You know where you are, of course.	Jo witte wêr't jo binne, fansels.
This must be a	Dit moat in
There is nothing to do.	Der is neat te dwaan.
That may not be true.	Dat kin net wier wêze.
She would not be afraid.	Se soe net bang wêze.
And how do you do.	En hoe dogge jo.
That you're trying to get there and it's really hard.	Dat jo besykje der te kommen en it is echt dreech.
Not exactly now.	No net krekt.
She said she did not know why.	Se sei dat se net wist wêrom.
I can not say that it has.	Ik kin net sizze dat it hat.
I had the same, over and over.	Ik hie deselde, oer en oer.
It was nice of him to do that himself.	It wie aardich fan him om sels dat te dwaan.
I do not know why he went that way.	Ik wit net wêrom't er sa gie.
Well, he better not have it.	No, hy hie it better net.
He wants to pay.	Hy wol betelje.
No one will be tired.	Nimmen sil wurch wêze.
That was before.	Dat wie earder.
Now she would love to come.	No soe se har graach komme.
Who would ever want to go after what he has done.	Wa soe ea wolle nei wat er dien hat.
It will not work.	It sil net wurkje.
Where? ' 	Wêr?'
That was not the problem.	Dat wie net it probleem.
If you have a problem, just ask, he said.	As jo ​​​​in probleem hawwe, freegje dan gewoan, sei hy.
You will come, right?	Jo sille komme, net?
But hope persists.	Mar hope hâldt oan.
I had help with the kids for sure.	Ik hie help mei de bern foar wis.
Had better.	Koe better.
I'm not sure why that is.	Ik bin der net wis fan wêrom dat is.
Well, today we know that is not true.	No, hjoed witte wy dat dat net wier is.
Money, money, money!	Jild, jild, jild!
There had been many.	Der hiene in protte west.
Do what you want.	Doch wat jo wolle.
She walked away without saying a word.	Se gie fuort sûnder in wurd te sizzen.
That was another time, another time.	Dat wie in oare tiid, in oare tiid.
But they were different now.	Mar se wiene no oars.
I did not get it all.	Ik krige it net allegear.
Look what they have given me.	Sjoch wat se my jûn hawwe.
He even told me that on the day we met.	Hy fertelde my sels dat op 'e dei dat wy moete.
We have to get through it.	Wy moatte der troch komme.
He had seen this man too.	Hy hie dizze man ek sjoen.
And so she comes with it.	En sa komt se der mei.
We would love to talk to you.	Wy wolle graach mei dy prate.
There was no one else.	Dêr wie gjinien oars.
And not just me.	En net allinnich ik.
It seems to be an office, my father's office.	It liket in kantoar te wêzen, it kantoar fan myn heit.
And we too.	En wy ek.
Or much of a past.	Of in protte fan in ferline.
It's good that you're here.	It is goed dat jo kommen binne.
We have to ask him.	Wy moatte him freegje.
So are our children.	Sa binne ús bern.
And you better.	En jo better.
It does not know wrong.	It wit gjin ferkeard.
He has not worked since.	Hy hat sûnt net wurke.
So were the people.	Sa wiene de minsken.
There are few who can say that about him.	Der binne min dy't dat fan him sizze kinne.
It was a question.	It wie in fraach.
You can not be.	Jo kinne net wêze.
Could be me.	Koe my wêze.
Come on, kids.	Kom op, bern.
I must be fine.	Ik moat goed wêze.
Or talk to everyone.	Of prate mei elkenien.
But he was careful not to like it too much.	Mar hy wie foarsichtich om it net te leuk te hawwen.
But there is nothing we can do.	Mar d'r is neat dat wy kinne dwaan.
They got on us.	Se krigen op ús.
That, of course, would never happen.	Dat soe fansels noait barre.
You'll never want to live in a big city again.	Jo sille noait wer by in grutte stêd wenje wolle.
We can not have him in our lives.	Wy kinne him net yn ús libben hawwe.
Now go on.	No gean troch.
I gave him a hand.	Ik joech him in hân.
I just did of course and stayed.	Ik die net fansels en bleau.
It did not work either.	It wurke ek net.
You will love them.	Jo sille fan har hâlde.
Can't help himself.	Kin himsels net helpe.
But that did not happen.	Mar sa barde it net.
These days is not clear.	Dizze dagen is net dúdlik.
I wanted to be that guy.	Ik woe dy keardel wêze.
He knew it was time to go.	Hy wist dat it tiid wie om te gean.
Must not be here.	Moat hjir net wêze.
Or maybe not.	Of miskien net.
I have been working hard all day.	Ik haw de hiele dei hurd wurke.
Never had one.	Nea hie ien.
Maybe he just does not have things to buy.	Miskien hat er gewoan gjin dingen om te keapjen.
That is not true.	Dat is net wier.
The man who tried to help my wife figured this out.	De man dy't besocht myn frou te helpen fûn dit út.
That's what I tried.	Dat haw ik besocht.
The truth is, they never do.	De wierheid is dat se noait dogge.
No problems found.	Gjin problemen fûn.
Tell me more about that book.	Fertel my mear oer dat boek.
I see things differently.	Ik sjoch dingen oars.
I did that first too.	Dat die ik earst ek.
Things were bad before.	Dingen wiene min earder.
Many had been.	In protte hiene west.
Now was her chance.	No wie har kâns.
But last night she felt different.	Mar fannacht fielde se har oars.
You must try it !.	Jo moatte it besykje!.
This would not work.	Dit soe net wurkje.
I need them both.	Ik haw se beide nedich.
But they know it.	Mar se witte it.
The one who had faith.	Dejinge dy't leauwe hie.
And we make it work.	En wy meitsje it wurk.
But that is not the right question.	Mar dat is net de goede fraach.
I needed to know who did it.	Ik moast witte wa't it die.
And he will know where.	En hy sil witte wêr.
His mother could not believe what he was saying.	Syn mem koe net leauwe wat er sei.
And everyone wanted to go to dinner.	En elkenien woe nei it iten gean.
That was more than not good.	Dat wie mear as net goed.
They are our lives.	Se binne ús libben.
I'm not done.	Ik bin net klear.
You just let me go.	Jo litte my gewoan gean.
She knew nothing.	Se wist neat.
Nothing we had not seen before.	Neat dat wy noch net earder sjoen hiene.
He is still.	Hy is noch altyd.
If you try, let me know how it goes.	As jo ​​​​besykje, lit my dan witte hoe't it giet.
Maybe he was just waiting for someone.	Miskien wachte er gewoan op immen.
He is obviously different.	Hy is fansels oars.
I do not know what it's for.	Ik wit net wêr't it foar is.
I will give them now.	Ik sil se no jaan.
He did not expect them.	Hy hie se net ferwachte.
But we were very happy to have her.	Mar wy wiene tige bliid om har te hawwen.
Of course, this is just what I'm talking about.	Fansels, dit is gewoan ik praat.
They do not get them.	Se krije se net.
Everyone liked it very much.	Elkenien fûn it tige goed.
It all.	It allegear.
He can not believe it's me.	Hy kin net leauwe dat it my bin.
One, of course, was time.	Ien, fansels, wie tiid.
He had never heard the name.	Hy hie de namme nea heard.
We just have to show that.	Dat moatte wy mar sjen litte.
My car is fine.	Myn auto is goed.
I heard it this morning.	Ik hearde it fan 'e moarn.
I did not know what to say to her.	Ik wist net wat ik har fertelle moast.
And you.	En do.
That's more than an hour.	Dat is mear as in oere.
And now not.	En no net.
Not against one man.	Net tsjin ien man.
They had a large family.	Se hiene in grutte famylje.
I'll never leave you.	Ik sil dy noait litte litte.
But he can not.	Mar hy kin net.
It said he was the best there is.	It sei hy wie de bêste der is.
And we did.	En wy diene.
He said he would try again next week.	Hy sei dat er nije wike wer besykje soe.
How many more are there ?.	Hoefolle mear binne der?.
She knew that now.	Dat wist se no.
He wanted it.	Hy woe dit.
Next year he will be thirty.	Takom jier wurdt er tritich.
We still have to do that.	Dat moatte wy noch dwaan.
She felt like she was who she was.	Se fielde dat se wie wa't se wie.
In fact, we do not talk about it that much.	Eins prate wy der net sa folle oer.
This is nothing.	Dit is neat.
And they want me with them.	En se wolle my mei har.
No one has been seen for more than thirty years.	Gjinien is al mear as tritich jier sjoen.
His words do not hold back either.	Syn wurden hâlde ek net tsjin.
He's just been too good.	Hy hat gewoan te goed west.
When do they arrive?	Wannear komme se oan?
Been on that road.	Op dy wei west.
That seemed to help.	Dat like te helpen.
Let's say no one has ever seen her.	Lit ús sizze dat nimmen har ea sjoen hat.
They do things differently.	Se dogge dingen wat oars.
I know and love his father.	Ik wit en hâld fan syn heit.
But we did that three years ago.	Mar dat diene wy ​​trije jier lyn.
So much has happened since then.	Der is sûnt dy tiid safolle bard.
And that may have been true.	En dat kin wier west hawwe.
And then on to bed.	En dan op bêd.
I'm sorry it had to be you.	It spyt my dat it dy wêze moast.
Something had gone wrong.	Der wie wat ferkeard gien.
So she wanted it bad.	Sa woe se it min.
But he could not.	Mar hy koe net.
But if you do not, that's fine.	Mar as jo dat net dogge, is dat goed.
You do what you have to.	Jo dogge wat jo moatte.
He had to find a wife.	Hy moast in frou fine.
We think he does not have to do that.	Wy hâlde dat hy dat net hoecht te dwaan.
So, it's just to see, you never know.	Dat, it giet gewoan om te sjen, jo witte it noait.
I think you're sick.	Ik tink dat jo siik binne.
It's been difficult.	It is dreech west.
So it is said.	Sa wurdt sein.
I thought it was pretty good.	Ik tocht it wie moai goed.
It's been here, always.	It is hjir al, altyd.
Round, he said.	Rûn, sei er.
They did not know they heard her.	Se wisten net dat se har hearde.
I'm here now to help you through this.	Ik bin hjir no om jo te helpen troch dit te kommen.
Nobody knows what to say.	Nimmen wit wat te sizzen.
This is just our time.	Dit is gewoan ús tiid.
She will show the police.	Se sil de plysje sjen litte.
All we can do now is wait.	Alles wat wy no kinne dwaan is wachtsje.
She could not believe it.	Se koe it net leauwe.
I love my hair.	Ik hâld fan myn hier.
I did not say much.	Ik sei net folle.
We're leaving as soon as she wakes up.	Wy geane sa gau as se wekker wurdt.
That was difficult.	Dat wie dreech.
He had no idea they were talking.	Hy hie gjin idee dat se prate.
I hope they make this a movie.	Ik hoopje dat se dit in film meitsje.
When she arrived.	Doe't se kaam.
We need to get back to the city.	Wy moatte werom nei de stêd.
But something else is happening.	Mar der bart wat oars.
Before they did.	Foardat se dat diene.
He had heard that there were twice as many.	Hy hie heard dat der twa kear safolle wiene.
But it was too late.	Mar it wie te let.
She would be in bed.	Se soe op bêd.
But there was no one around, it seemed.	Mar der wie gjinien om, it like wol.
Where could she go?	Wêr koe se hinne?
You were not ready for that.	Dêr wiene jo net klear foar.
It was over him.	It wie oer him hinne.
It was not enough yet.	It wie noch net genôch.
I actually do not like it.	Ik doch it eins net graach.
But he is an animal.	Mar hy is in bist.
Come for food.	Kom foar iten.
The city was busy with people.	De stêd wie drok mei minsken.
But here goes.	Mar hjir giet.
She does not want me him.	Se wol my net him.
He then leaves and goes back to the city.	Hy giet dan fuort en giet werom nei de stêd.
I do not want you to leave me.	Ik wol net datst by my wei bist.
Could it be better.	Kin it better.
He wanted her to talk to the boy.	Hy woe dat se mei de jonge prate soe.
I need money.	Ik haw jild nedich.
It's a belief.	It is in leauwe.
You will make friends.	Jo sille freonen meitsje.
Well, it's time again.	No, it is wer sa tiid.
I've never thought about it too hard.	Ik ha der noait te hurd oer tocht.
There was plenty of food around.	Der wie genôch iten om hinne.
I do not think it would be so difficult.	Ik tink net dat it sa dreech wêze soe.
Will see clearly.	Sil dúdlik sjen.
He really wanted this job.	Hy woe echt dizze baan.
It seemed like just one.	It like mar ien te wêzen.
I found it two weeks ago.	Ik fûn it twa wike lyn.
She was waiting at her friend's home.	Se wachte by har freon thús.
Not that there was anything to be seen by that time.	Net dat der tsjin dy tiid noch wat te sjen wie.
I do not have time for everyone.	Ik haw net tiid foar elkenien.
It's not good to just have each other.	It is net goed om elkoar gewoan te hawwen.
This is the only way to the city.	Dit is de ienige wei nei de stêd.
She was not wrong.	Se wie net ferkeard.
It's the mother in me.	It is de mem yn my.
She did not say much of anything.	Se sei net folle fan neat.
We're ready for you.	Wy binne klear as jo binne.
I just became very good friends with everyone there.	Ik waard krekt hiel goede freonen mei elkenien dêr.
They worked very hard.	Se wurke hiel hurd.
For him, it was his job.	Foar him wie it syn wurk.
I think he's been sick for a long time.	Ik tink dat er al lang siik west hat.
So too with people.	Sa ek mei minsken.
I do not even know what it was about.	Ik wit net iens wêr't it oer gie.
Let it go.	Lit it mar litte.
I can not get out of there like that.	Ik kin der net sa út.
We need to do this now.	Wy moatte dit no dwaan.
There he sat and worried.	Dêr siet er en soargen.
I'm gone two weeks.	Ik bin twa wike fuort.
This is a woman who works hard.	Dit is in frou dy't hurd wurket.
So we were ready.	Sa wiene wy ​​klear.
You've talked to her before.	Do hast al earder mei har praat.
We have each other.	Wy hawwe elkoar.
It was not my idea.	It wie myn idee net.
We had nothing to do with it.	Wy hiene der neat mei te krijen.
We obviously needed it.	Wy hiene it fansels nedich.
And totally surprised to be here.	En hielendal ferrast om hjir te wêzen.
My parents know about this and they are very worried.	Myn âlden witte oer dit en se binne tige soargen.
Never been to before.	Nea earder op west.
But anything you can tell me can help.	Mar alles wat jo my kinne fertelle kin helpe.
Now one thing.	No ien ding.
With the food.	Mei it iten.
And not everything has to be about money.	En net alles moat oer jild gean.
And that may still be the case.	En dat kin noch wol sa wêze.
They still do not know who you are.	Se witte noch net wa't jo binne.
If only that were true.	As dat mar wier wie.
I'm not really sure how to do this.	Ik bin der net echt wis fan hoe dit te dwaan.
But it was really from.	Mar it wie echt fan.
That did not happen either.	Dat is ek net bard.
The woman opened it again and looked out.	De frou die it wer iepen en seach út.
Do not even ask.	Net iens freegje.
For me, the truth is enough.	Foar my is de wierheid genôch.
She had never heard anyone say that.	Se hie noch nea ien sizzen heard.
I see more in this than you.	Ik sjoch mear yn dit as dy.
But that is not true.	Mar dat is net wier.
Think this way.	Tink dizze manier.
He was really worried.	Hy wie echt soargen.
Take the big idea home.	Nim it grutte idee thús.
What movie are you going to see tonight?	Hokker film sille jo fannacht sjen?
Next, let other people try it.	Folgjende, lit oare minsken besykje it.
Really liked the person.	Echt leuk de persoan.
We are three.	Wy binne trije.
He had that thing forever.	Hy hie dat ding foar altyd.
Which he probably would.	Wat hy wierskynlik soe.
But you could do nothing.	Mar jo koene neat dwaan.
Everyone asked him of course.	Elkenien frege him fansels.
But she said they were not.	Mar se sei dat se net wiene.
Waiting for someone to come.	Wachtsje op ien om te kommen.
Very very good.	Hiel hiel goed.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Fertel my asjebleaft krekt wat jo sein hawwe.
This can be done.	Dit kin dien wurde.
Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.	Lit my asjebleaft witte as jo oare fragen of soargen hawwe.
In fact, it was not certain it wanted to be found.	Eins wie it net wis dat it fûn wurde woe.
You hope it is.	Jo hoopje dat it is.
We do not know yet.	Wy witte it noch net.
And we have nothing to do.	En wy hawwe neat te dwaan.
It was my father's name.	It wie de namme fan myn heit.
This whole thing.	Dit hiele ding.
He could have anything he wanted to eat.	Hy koe alles hawwe wat er ite woe.
That will have to wait.	Dat sil wachtsje moatte.
Wait a few days you say.	Wachtsje in pear dagen sizze jo.
It's a very, very good book.	It is in hiel, hiel goed boek.
That he had said himself.	Dat hie er sels sein.
We talked earlier.	Wy prate earder.
She was the talk of the town.	Se wie it praat fan 'e stêd.
I can tell.	Ik kin fertelle.
You get so tired.	Jo wurde sa wurch.
He kept coming.	Hy bleau kommen.
We can help people who need help.	Wy kinne minsken helpe dy't help nedich hawwe.
I have no idea where he got the money.	Ik haw gjin idee wêr't hy it jild krige.
She wanted her parents back.	Se woe har âlden werom.
You should know.	Jo soene witte.
We will not find them again.	Wy sille se net wer fine.
I love things being done.	Ik hâld fan dingen dien wurde.
I heard a lot of good things about it.	Ik hearde in protte goede dingen oer.
She probably knew it too.	Se wist it wierskynlik ek.
He was interested.	Hy wie ynteressearre.
That's your job too.	Dat is ek dyn wurk.
Not these days.	Net dizze dagen.
Just need to stay together.	Krekt moatte bliuwe tegearre.
To what he was before.	Oan wat er earder wie.
It was a very good book.	It wie in hiel goed boek.
A man walked away when police asked for it.	In man gie fuort doe't de plysje it frege.
But they already knew him.	Mar se koene him al.
I really do not know.	Ik wit it echt net.
He knew the place.	Hy koe it plak.
Then I go away.	Dan gean ik fuort.
No one can do everything.	Nimmen kin alles dwaan.
If it makes you happy.	As it makket dy bliid.
Of course you have not.	Fansels hawwe jo net.
How can you try to find out?	Hoe kinne jo besykje út te finen?
That's the kind of thing that needs to stop now.	Dat is it soarte ding dat no ophâlde moat.
We need to stop now.	Wy moatte no ophâlde.
Do this now!	Doch dit no!
Why not, he said.	Wêrom net, sei er.
It happens more than you want to know.	It bart mear as jo wolle witte.
Back here.	Hjir werom.
He could do nothing for her, not yet.	Hy koe neat foar har dwaan, noch net.
He said they would.	Hy sei dat se soene.
I took him home and gave him my bed.	Ik naam him thús en joech him myn bêd.
One day they get us.	Op in dei krije se ús.
People were just angry.	Minsken wiene gewoan lilk.
That was good.	Dat wie goed.
He's not worried about that.	Hy seit doch der gjin soargen oer.
In other words, you need to know things to read.	Mei oare wurden, jo moatte dingen witte om te lêzen.
Not sure if that's the reason though.	Net wis oft dat is de reden al.
I'll show him.	Ik sil him sjen litte.
She was his life for life.	Se wie syn libben foar it libben.
He wants to go home.	Hy wol nei hûs.
That shows what kind of a man you are.	Dat lit sjen wat foar in man jo binne.
We can agree on one thing.	Wy kinne it oer ien ding iens wurde.
Just scared.	Gewoan bang.
Maybe my dad's name is on it.	Miskien stiet de namme fan myn heit der op.
Really nothing else to say.	Echt neat oars te sizzen.
There must be a better way to find out where they are.	Der moat in bettere manier wêze om te finen wêr't se binne.
Get out of the house.	Gean út it hûs.
She was not like that.	Se wie net sa.
They'll do something good there.	Se sille d'r wat goed dwaan.
He left three children behind.	Hy liet trije bern nei.
And you think.	En jo tinke.
I want in that room.	Ik wol yn dy keamer.
But problems remain.	Mar problemen bliuwe.
I really do not want to.	Ik wol eins net.
All that was in the past.	Alles dat wie yn it ferline.
You just want something more.	Jo wolle gewoan wat mear.
Neither has work.	Gjin fan beide hat wurk.
I will not hold you to that.	Ik sil dy der net oan hâlde.
Good work with that.	Goed wurk mei dat.
We do not know what they want.	Wy witte net wat se wolle.
If she told me she would not, she would keep her word.	As se my fertelde dat se it net soe, soe se har wurd hâlde.
She was beautiful, he thought.	Se wie moai, tocht er.
That's it though.	Dat is it wol.
We take everyone.	Wy nimme elkenien.
I never read it.	Ik haw it noait lêzen.
You have to make it yourself.	Jo moatte it sels meitsje.
There are none left.	Der binne gjinien oer.
He asked if you had time for him today.	Hy frege oft jo hjoed tiid foar him hawwe.
The young woman asked her why she was there.	De jonge frou frege har wêrom't se dêr wie.
I can not agree with you either.	Ik kin it ek net mei dy iens wêze.
Show him another way.	Lit him in oare manier sjen.
Now there was something else.	No wie der wat oars.
But he did not know it.	Mar hy wist it net.
These do not, but they get better and better, and that's fun.	Dizze net, mar se wurde better en better, en dat is leuk.
That's clear.	Dat is dúdlik.
But that's not my job.	Mar dat is net myn dwaan.
So did everyone.	Sa hie elkenien.
It started well.	It begûn goed.
And something else.	En noch wat.
Can you give me some more money?	Kinne jo my wat mear jild jaan?
I do not feel it.	Ik fiel it net.
That's my new bike.	Dat is myn nije fyts.
Who gets up first?	Wa stiet der earst op?
However, it would not happen.	Hoe dan ek, it soe net barre.
By life.	By it libben.
Neither do my parents.	Myn âlden ek net.
It was as if he was waiting for something.	It like as wachte er op wat.
There was no going back.	Der wie gjin wei werom.
We need to talk.	Wy moatte prate.
It's not my thing.	It is net myn ding.
And he could not see.	En hy koe net sjen.
No one was home.	Gjinien wie thús.
Come out and see me.	Kom út en sjoch my.
This can be more than talking.	Dit kin mear wêze as praten.
We have almost no water.	Wy hawwe hast gjin wetter.
This can be a problem.	Dit kin in probleem wêze.
Not his mother.	Net syn mem.
I do not have much more.	Ik haw net folle mear.
Of course not.	Dat hie it fansels net.
But not forever.	Mar net foar altyd.
He had done this before, of course.	Hy hie dit fansels earder dien.
Waited until tomorrow.	Wachte oant moarn.
That they talk us up.	Dat se prate ús op.
It was pretty easy to find.	It wie frij maklik te finen.
They hit it.	Se rekke it.
But this one is easy to figure out.	Mar dizze is maklik út te finen.
I think this is the way to go.	Ik tink dat dit de manier is om te gean.
Maybe I should try that.	Miskien moat ik dat besykje.
It can be done, but it is not easy.	It kin dien wurde, mar it is net maklik.
This time with someone much better.	Dizze kear mei immen folle better.
He had a little money.	Hy hie in bytsje jild.
This will help the problem.	Dit sil it probleem helpe.
It was her book.	It wie har boek.
They want to see them do well.	Se wolle har goed dwaan sjen.
I need her now more than ever.	Ik haw har no mear nedich as ea.
She wants to do something different.	Se wol wat oars dwaan.
She did not want to ask.	Se woe net freegje.
It will not even come to doing these things.	It sil net iens komme by it dwaan fan dizze dingen.
And this happens whether you like it or not.	En dit bart oft jo it leuk fine of net.
And they do not like the boy.	En dy hâlde net fan de jonge.
She's been sick of this.	Se is hjir as siik fan west.
He was done with that.	Dêr wie er klear mei.
He's hard to get.	Hy is dreech te krijen.
I do not want to go back.	Ik wol net werom.
It could do nothing else.	It koe neat oars.
I'm not afraid of you.	Ik bin net bang foar dy.
But without it.	Mar sûnder it.
And so it happened.	En sa barde it.
And we are not bad at it.	En wy binne der net min yn.
Since then no one has heard from him.	Sûnt hat gjinien fan him heard.
But not my mother.	Mar net myn mem.
Maybe it was nothing.	Miskien wie it neat.
Good food, of course.	Goed iten, fansels.
The other was long.	De oare wie lang.
It was not his place to do anything.	It wie net syn plak om wat te dwaan.
That's not your job.	Dat is net dyn wurk.
He was needed.	Hy wie nedich.
Wrong name.	Hat de namme ferkeard.
They need so much help.	Se hawwe safolle help nedich.
Out of.	Sûnder.
But this never happens well.	Mar dit bart noait goed.
That lets me get there.	Dat lit my dêr ta komme.
This just might not be right.	Dit kin gewoan net goed wêze.
I do not want to be his friend.	Ik wol syn freon net wêze.
You heard me talk.	Jo hawwe my praten heard.
He knows it too.	Hy wit it ek.
I just wanted to know where she was.	Ik woe gewoan witte wêr't se wie.
We were afraid this would happen.	Wy wiene bang dat dit barre soe.
Life is as good as it can be.	It libben is sa goed as it kin wêze.
That I would say.	Dat soe ik sizze.
Do not be so much around.	Wês der net sa folle om.
I believe in her words first.	Ik leau earst yn har wurden.
My favorite movie.	Myn favorite film.
That's not what it's about.	Dêr giet it net om.
I'm not good.	Ik bin net goed.
It's really nice.	It is echt moai.
And we need to come up with a better plan.	En wy moatte mei in better plan komme.
That's what she said.	Dat sei se.
Everything used to work well until a few weeks ago.	Alles wurke eartiids goed oant in pear wike lyn.
We did no good to each other.	Wy diene elkoar gjin goed.
It was both of us at home.	It wie ús beide thús.
We were just back from a job.	Wy wiene krekt werom fan in baan.
Your problem will remain.	Jo probleem sil bliuwe.
It could not, he said to himself.	It koe net, sei er tsjin himsels.
Nothing to be afraid of.	Neat om bang foar te wêzen.
You will too.	Jo sille ek.
I did not know how you would get us out of the latter.	Ik wist net hoe't jo ús út dat lêste krije soene.
My parents are not together.	Myn âlden binne net tegearre.
Really they were nothing.	Echt wiene se neat.
You can even take what comes to you.	Jo kinne sels nimme wat nei jo komt.
I was not a little scared.	Ik wie net in bytsje bang.
It was difficult at first.	It wie earst dreech.
You want to get to is that sooner.	Jo wolle komme ta is dat earder.
I can not tell.	Ik kin it net fertelle.
It never looks the same.	It liket noait itselde.
I did not go back to class.	Ik gie net werom nei de klasse.
And well that can.	En goed dat kin.
Her mother was nice.	Har mem wie aardich.
I'm not free, she thought.	Ik bin net frij, tocht se.
He tried hard.	Hy besocht hurd.
And we all know what will happen then.	En wy witte allegear wat der dan barre sil.
I'm not sure.	Ik bin der net wis fan.
You need to take care of your father now.	Jo moatte no foar jo heit soargje.
What should you not do?	Wat moatte jo net dwaan?
I need your help.	Ik ha dyn help nedich.
I can not make it better.	Ik kin it net better meitsje.
That was my problem.	Dat wie myn probleem.
I know these people.	Ik ken dizze minsken.
He had neither.	Hy hie gjin beide.
The more reason why you should tell me what is being said.	Hoe mear reden wêrom jo moatte fertelle my wat wurdt sein.
Someone would come.	Der soe ien komme.
Good! 	Goed!
so shall we do.	sa sille wy dwaan.
Someone who looks like him.	Immen dy't op him liket.
And you too.	En jo ek.
He seems to be buying time.	Hy liket tiid te keapjen.
I can not help it.	Ik kin it net helpe.
I need to see it come back.	Ik moat sjen dat it werom komt.
They do too.	Se meitsje ek.
We feel that two things need to be done.	Wy fine dat der twa dingen dien wurde moatte.
Good so far.	Goed oant no ta.
He could still be the first.	Hy koe noch wol de earste wêze.
We think differently.	Wy tinke oars.
The movie is good.	De film is goed.
The person who is here is the person who is sitting now.	De persoan dy't hjir is, is de persoan dy't no sit.
Clearly he was angry.	Dúdlik wie er lilk.
That's not true!	Dat is net wier!
But this is not the way to go.	Mar dit is net de manier om te gean.
He would be here again tomorrow.	Hy soe hjir moarn wer wêze.
You know this.	Jo witte dit.
And well he might.	En goed hy mocht.
I told him no way.	Ik fertelde him gjin manier.
Everyone has that.	Elkenien hat dat.
But it is not the same.	Mar it is net itselde.
This was not one.	Dit wie net ien.
They never had any children together.	Se hiene noait gjin bern tegearre.
I should be angry.	Ik soe lilk wêze moatte.
But it was not the same as that.	Mar it wie net itselde as dat.
You do not eat.	Jo ite net.
She had loved her husband and her life.	Se hie fan har man en har libben hâlden.
Maybe it does not have to be money.	Miskien hoecht it gjin jild te wêzen.
It must be you.	It moat dy wêze.
Of course she had seen it.	Fansels hie se it sjoen.
She hoped he could still see where he was going.	Se hope dat er noch sjen koe wêr't er hinne soe.
Not if you want to stay alive.	Net as jo yn libben bliuwe wolle.
I want to see it.	Ik wol it sjen.
That does not happen.	Dat bart net.
No one could say why or against what.	Net ien koe sizze wêrom of tsjin wat.
It just does not work.	It wurket gewoan net.
It can be really hard.	It kin echt dreech wêze.
They did a lot of good things for me.	Se diene in protte goede dingen foar my.
Bart, and it scares me.	Bart, en it makket my bang.
You can have something and go.	Jo kinne wat hawwe en gean.
One or two.	Ien of twa.
You'll never see me again.	Jo sille my noait wer sjen.
There they were still, now almost at the mine.	Dêr wiene se noch, no hast by de myn.
Everyone was out and about.	Elkenien wie út en troch.
I quickly went to.	Ik gie gau nei.
We were family.	Wy wiene famylje.
That's one thing.	Dat is ien ding.
He could do nothing more here.	Hy koe hjir neat mear dwaan.
I think it went well.	Ik tink dat it goed gien is.
I needed more money.	Ik hie mear jild nedich.
He met his teacher yesterday.	Hy moete juster syn learaar.
I really do not see that.	Dat sjoch ik echt net.
This whole thing is my idea.	Dit hiele ding is myn idee.
I really want to see her.	Ik wol har echt sjen.
That was a concern.	Dat wie in soargen.
I'm pretty happy now.	Ik bin no aardich bliid.
She hoped he would be careful.	Se hope dat er foarsichtich wêze soe.
That's not her.	Dat is se net.
The idea is as follows.	It idee is it folgjende.
Do not open it.	Meitsje it net op.
I did not know it would do that.	Ik wist net dat it dat dwaan soe.
I did a bit of both.	Ik die in bytsje fan beide.
What it was we did not know.	Wat it wie wisten wy net.
His mother is here.	Syn mem is hjir.
He does not even look at him.	Hy sjocht him net iens oan.
I ask you to do the same.	Ik freegje dy om itselde te dwaan.
Did something happen?	Is der wat bard?
I heard them talking, but not exactly what was being said.	Ik hearde se praten, mar net krekt wat der sein waard.
Let's show how good you are!	Litte wy sjen hoe goed jo binne!
You have a new chance here.	Jo hawwe hjir in nije kâns.
You just can not say the same for them right now.	Jo kinne no krekt net itselde foar har sizze.
Talk them through it.	Praat se troch it.
And it had been good.	En it hie goed west.
And there are many.	En der binne in protte.
It was things.	It wiene dingen.
If it does not, it is a bad book.	As it dat net docht, is it in min boek.
A mere couple.	In gewoan pear.
He will not submerge you.	Hy sil dy net ûnder wetter sette.
Who he really can be, we do not know.	Wa't hy echt wêze kin, witte wy net.
He thought he might need one.	Hy tocht dat er miskien ien nedich hie.
I really did not know what to say.	Ik wist echt net wat ik sizze moast.
She's getting better now, but not all is well yet.	Se wurdt no better, mar noch net alles goed.
I'm not sure what that is exactly.	Ik bin der net wis fan wat dat krekt is.
That, of course, they are.	Dat binne se fansels.
I met him right now.	Ik moete him krekt no.
It must be.	It moat wêze.
But what then.	Mar wat dan.
You have to get on the bus.	Jo moatte op 'e bus.
I think my kids might like this.	Ik tink dat myn bern dit miskien leuk fine.
Here's something off.	Hjir is wat ôf.
You had.	Do hiest.
He wanted her away.	Hy woe har fuort.
Do not ask me what he thought.	Freegje my net wat er tocht.
There is no tomorrow here.	Der is hjir gjin moarn.
I want back.	Ik wol werom.
There was one other person in the room.	Der wie ien oare persoan yn 'e keamer.
That's what I said.	Dat sei ik.
It was clear she had told him something.	It wie dúdlik dat se him wat ferteld hie.
Well, that was no help.	No, dat wie gjin help.
Now with you and me it's different.	No mei dy en my is it oars.
I knew it was her.	Ik wist dat it har wie.
Not very good.	Hiel net goed.
You've probably been here before.	Jo hawwe hjir wierskynlik earder west.
Something happened.	Der barde wat.
There is too much not said.	Der is te folle net sein.
I will go with you easily.	Ik sil maklik mei dy gean.
But do not worry about it now.	Mar meitsje jo dêr no gjin soargen oer.
Here was no one else.	Hjir wie gjinien oars.
Not many friends.	Net folle freonen.
The man is ready.	De man is klear.
You work very hard.	Jo wurkje heul hurd.
How do you get around then?	Hoe komme jo dan om?
She also tried to get to work.	Se besocht ek oan it wurk te gean.
It's completely different.	It is hielendal oars.
Do a good job.	Doch in goed wurk.
He did not know where.	Hy wist net wêr.
Until we knew if it was true or not.	Oant wy wisten oft it wier wie of net.
I know what it's like.	Ik wit hoe't it is.
She was obviously not someone who asked for it.	Se wie fansels net ien dy't der om frege.
Too much here.	Hjir te folle.
Not after all that time.	Net nei al dy tiid.
Get up there, now.	Kom der op, no.
Go in, and go out.	Gean yn, en gean út.
And so they did.	En dat diene se.
You are with her.	Do bist by har.
They don't talk anymore.	Se prate net mear.
I want the baby, but we are not ready for it.	Ik wol it bern ha, mar wy binne der net klear foar.
It probably would have.	It soe wierskynlik hawwe.
I wanted to have a good time with it.	Ik woe der goed mei ha.
That was what he had said.	Dat hie er sein.
But this has little to do with anything.	Mar dit hat net folle mei neat te krijen.
We take the day.	Wy nimme it dei.
I was expecting it.	Ik hie it ferwachte.
Make friends with anyone who is good to you.	Meitsje freonen mei elkenien dy't goed foar jo is.
Do what you do best.	Doch wat jo it bêste dogge.
Try to do it together, they say.	Besykje it tegearre te dwaan, sizze se.
No way to tell for sure.	Gjin manier om foar wis te fertellen.
I could not let it happen again.	Ik koe it net wer barre litte.
But he has nothing to do with it.	Mar dêr hat er neat oan.
You know you have.	Jo witte dat jo hawwe.
He's my friend.	Hy is myn freon.
That's not what it's about.	Dêr giet it net oer.
You believe what you want to believe.	Jo leauwe wat jo leauwe wolle.
He probably would not like it.	Hy soe it wierskynlik net leuk fine.
It just has to.	It moat gewoan.
You can see by seeing that no one here is happy.	Jo kinne sjen troch te sjen dat gjinien hjir bliid is.
There had to be something he could do.	Der moast wat wêze dat er dwaan koe.
I'm his best man.	Ik bin syn bêste man.
I never asked him to do something he did not want to do.	Ik haw him noait frege om wat te dwaan wat er net wol.
I will never tell anyone.	Ik sil it noait oan ien fertelle.
I need to have enough time.	Ik moat genôch tiid hawwe.
They knew it all.	Se wisten it allegear.
I could tell she did not.	Ik koe sizze dat se net die.
But we are still there.	Mar wy binne der noch.
There is an open problem for the same.	D'r is in iepen probleem foar itselde.
Anyone who wanted to could see through.	Elkenien dy't woe, koe der troch sjen.
I'm not too sure about that and.	Ik bin net te wis oer dat en.
We will not be convinced.	Wy sille net oertsjûge wurde.
You need one.	Jo hawwe ien nedich.
It is not entirely clear what happened here.	It is net hielendal dúdlik wat hjir bard is.
It should be the opportunity to make money.	It moat de kâns wêze om jild te meitsjen.
Look at each other.	Sjoch nei elkoar.
That should not be the problem.	Dat soe it probleem net wêze moatte.
I did not even want to see it.	Ik woe it net iens sjen.
But there is one thing that everyone should know.	Mar d'r is ien ding dat elkenien moat witte.
Nor would the money.	Ek soe it jild net.
They did not agree.	Se wiene it net iens.
Go back now.	Gean no werom.
He was not easy to find.	Hy wie net maklik te finen.
He's not in yet.	Hy is noch net yn.
This was his chance.	Dit wie syn kâns.
Let's go.	Lit ús gean.
I'm like that's gone.	Ik bin as is dat fuort.
That was all he said.	Dat wie alles wat er sei.
We decided to publish the book ourselves.	Wy besletten it boek sels út te jaan.
He could not stay away forever.	Hy koe net foar altyd fuort bliuwe.
That's what we did.	Dat diene wy.
Your mother is very worried.	Jo mem is tige soargen.
This would get you there.	Dit soe jo dêr komme.
Your kids will have to take their chances.	Jo bern sille har kâns moatte nimme.
How will you make sure this does not happen?	Hoe sille jo soargje dat dit net bart?
I need to show someone.	Ik moat immen sjen litte.
It must be.	Moat it wêze.
It was the best day of his life.	It wie de bêste dei fan syn libben.
That was what it felt like.	Dat wie wat it fielde.
Everyone was eating.	Elkenien wie oan it iten.
I do not know what he is doing.	Ik wit net wat er docht.
You're bad.	Do bist min.
We also do so many other things.	Wy dogge ek safolle oare dingen.
Someone had to help her.	Immen moast har helpe.
It was easy to find.	It wie maklik te finen.
We talk about nothing and everything.	Wy prate oer neat en alles.
She was pretty clear about what needed to be done.	Se wie frij dúdlik oer wat der dien wurde moast.
I could do it if you want.	Ik koe it dwaan as jo wolle.
Until then, we need to be ready for anything.	Oant dan moatte wy op alles ree wêze.
This year is even better.	Dit jier is noch better.
I was sitting on bed.	Ik siet op bêd.
Not yet.	Noch net.
Probably me too.	Wierskynlik ik ek.
It will never be the same.	It sil noait itselde wurde.
He could not see her, but he did not have to.	Hy koe har net sjen, mar hy moast net.
You have to see them.	Jo moatte se sjen.
I'm just telling the truth.	Ik fertel gewoan de wierheid.
If they could see her now.	As se har no sjen koene.
He saw the best in people.	Hy seach it bêste yn minsken.
And, you know, you go over and look at them.	En, jo witte, jo geane oer en sjoch nei har.
But try before you buy.	Mar besykje foardat jo keapje.
Careful now.	Foarsichtich no.
I am sorry.	It spyt my.
But we get to do what we love.	Mar wy krije te dwaan wat wy graach.
I felt really good.	Ik fielde my echt goed.
This is not that day.	Dit is net dy dei.
Do not worry.	Meitsje dy net drok.
Hurry up, he said.	Hast op, sei er.
I do not care what happens to the money.	Ik jou der neat oan wat der mei it jild bart.
I found it hard to be afraid of him.	Ik fûn it dreech om bang foar him te wêzen.
We often work together on issues.	Wy wurkje faak tegearre oan problemen.
It's much more than that.	It is folle mear as dat.
With the arrival of the evening it was time to leave.	Mei it kommen fan 'e jûn wie it tiid om fuort te gean.
I could not leave, now not.	Ik koe net fuort, no net.
In it.	Yn it.
So she told no one at first.	Sa fertelde se it earst oan nimmen.
She ran them away.	Se rûn se fuort.
That is where they should come from.	Dêr soene se oan komme moatte.
But soon it did not matter much.	Mar al gau makke it net folle út.
He may have been there a week.	Hy kin der wol in wike west hawwe.
We will be working on it in a week.	Wy sille it yn 'e wike wurkje.
I'm the word police.	Ik bin it wurd plysje.
Everything about this is up to you.	Alles oer dit is oan jo.
She is interested in a new man.	Se is ynteressearre yn in nije man.
Police at that time.	Plysje yn dy tiid.
I hold back.	Ik hâld my werom.
Can you tell me the time, please?	Kinne jo my de tiid sizze, asjebleaft?
He knew it had been too easy.	Hy wist dat it te maklik west hie.
My kind, or his kind.	Myn soarte, of syn soarte.
It went on and on.	It gie om en om.
And it would not be easy.	En it soe net maklik wêze.
I'm out of here soon.	Ik bin der gau út.
It seemed good to her.	It like har goed.
He had been there.	Hy hie der west.
I have to go back.	Ik moat werom.
It must.	It moat.
I'm not afraid of what people say about me.	Ik bin net bang foar wat minsken oer my sizze.
It is better to go to bed early.	It is better om betiid op bêd te gean.
I did nothing more than look at her.	Ik die net mear as nei har sjen.
It seems like nothing is working.	It liket derop dat neat wurket.
I'm sure you've heard.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo heard hawwe.
Be open to it.	Wês der iepen foar.
Dad never told me that.	Dat hat heit my noait ferteld.
He did not take her.	Hy naam har net.
he said.	hy sei.
His wife could not pay.	Syn frou koe net betelje.
Nobody knows what will happen.	Nimmen wit wat der barre sil.
I will not be there.	Ik sil der net wêze.
You tell us whether you have these or not.	Jo fertelle ús oft jo dizze hawwe of net.
But it can not.	Mar it kin net.
Well, a few.	No, in pear.
Do not want to.	Wol net.
And maybe they are nothing to you.	En miskien binne se foar jo neat.
And that was all.	En dat wie alles.
It's not easy.	It is net maklik.
Maybe he did not know what it was.	Miskien wist er net wat it wie.
Only they know what is best.	Allinnich se witte wat it bêste is.
He must not stay.	Hy moat net bliuwe.
She was angry.	Se wie lilk.
There and not there.	Dêr en net dêr.
The latter was not either.	Dat lêste wie ek net.
His girl had made it.	Syn famke hie it makke.
I thought she was attracted to me.	Ik tocht dat se my oan hie.
When someone came home it would give him time.	As immen thús kaam soe it him tiid jaan.
Your time has come.	Jo tiid is kommen.
I immediately thought of you.	Ik tocht fuort oan dy.
That it was not so easy to find them.	Dat it wie net sa maklik om se te finen.
How do you think this should be done ?.	Hoe tinke jo dat dit dien wurde moat?.
You keep it happening.	Jo bliuwe it barre.
I wanted my friends back.	Ik woe myn freonen werom.
But again, we do not do it.	Mar noch ien kear, wy dogge it net.
It's still there.	It is der noch.
They come right inside me and go away.	Se komme fuort yn my en gean fuort.
He's really good.	Hy is echt goed.
Her only job.	Har ienige baan.
I did not want to go.	Ik woe net gean.
I should have known he would.	Ik hie witte moatten dat hy soe.
But no one did.	Mar gjinien die.
I'm not so sure.	Ik bin der net sa wis fan.
They had.	Se hiene.
This is it now.	Dit is it no.
Why do you think she got angry?	Wêrom tinke jo dat se lilk waard?
Or even do.	Of sels dwaan.
He works very hard.	Hy wurket hiel hurd.
They can be angry.	Se kinne lilk wêze.
My family lives there.	Myn famylje wennet dêr.
I agree with the first, but not the last.	Ik bin it iens mei de earste, mar net de lêste.
Or you do not now.	Of jo no net.
To make life.	Om libben te meitsjen.
That's what she actually said.	Dat hie se eins sein.
And one thing is very clear.	En ien ding is hiel dúdlik.
She says no one asked herself if she needed help.	Se seit dat nimmen har sels frege oft se help nedich hie.
Every now and then she looks up.	Sa no en dan sjocht se op.
Almost never be happy to be.	Hast noait bliid wêze om te wêzen.
Everything was fine.	Alles wie goed.
They were very angry.	Se wiene tige lilk.
He let me talk for an hour.	Hy liet my in oere prate.
This was exactly what they needed.	Dit wie krekt wat se nedich wiene.
It was and is there all the time.	It wie en is der de hiele tiid.
I saw something else.	Ik seach noch wat.
You would do nothing.	Jo soene neat dwaan.
I'll tell you about it.	Ik sil jo der oer fertelle.
You know where you want to go.	Jo witte wêr't jo hinne wolle.
He scares me.	Hy makket my bang.
We need to have you.	Wy moatte dy hawwe.
Seen it before.	It earder sjoen.
How much does he do.	Hoefolle docht hy.
It would come in handy now.	It soe no goed komme.
She needed to eat more.	Se moast mear ite.
It's like we never have any problems.	It is as hawwe wy noait gjin problemen.
He said we would not do that.	Hy sei dat wy dat net dwaan soene.
It's hard to say which is better.	It is dreech om te sizzen hokker better is.
I have done it for many people.	Ik haw it dien foar in protte minsken.
We are not there.	Wy binne der net.
Giving yourself life could take it.	It sels jaan fan it libben koe it nimme.
You just said so much.	Jo hawwe krekt sein safolle.
It now seems pretty clear that they are both.	It liket no aardich dúdlik dat se beide binne.
You know that now.	Dat witte jo no wol.
I have heard many good things about your work.	Ik haw in protte goede dingen heard oer jo wurk.
This is my one day off this week.	Dit is myn ien dei frij dizze wike.
Or if you have a lot of doubts.	Of as jo in protte twifelje.
I asked him what was going on.	Ik frege him wat der oan de hân wie.
You should see me soon.	Jo moatte my gau sjen.
She felt so much better.	Se fielde har sa wat better.
Such a photo would cost money.	Sa'n foto soe jild freegje.
It was as if he was talking to himself.	It wie oft er tsjin himsels prate.
Better days, of course.	Better dagen, fansels.
If nothing else, those were the good words.	As net oars, dat wiene de goede wurden.
He did not know how he knew it.	Hy wist net hoe't er it wist.
Nothing interested her.	Neat ynteressearre har.
She was afraid of him.	Se wie bang foar him.
This year the time has come.	Dit jier is de tiid kommen.
She does not come out too much.	Se komt net te folle út.
I made so much money.	Ik makke safolle jild.
He did not indicate how long we would stay in the water.	Hy joech net oan hoe lang wy yn it wetter bliuwe soene.
People say it's good.	Minsken sizze dat it goed is.
I had to get it right.	Ik moast it goed krije.
He did not have to do that.	Dat hie er net hoege te dwaan.
There is not enough water here.	Der is hjir net genôch wetter.
We had good days.	Wy hiene goede dagen.
Now we have to go.	No moatte wy gean.
This is not just about me.	Dit giet net allinnich oer my.
You've seen it.	Jo hawwe it sjoen.
They know better.	Se witte wol better.
Not much has been said about that so far.	Dêr is oant no ta net folle oer sein.
I feel good about it.	Ik fiel my der goed oer.
I'm not sure what to do about it.	Ik bin der net wis fan wat ik dêr oan dwaan moat.
Everything looks much better.	Alles sjocht der folle better út.
So we do not let them either.	Sa litte wy har ek net litte.
Not out in the open for him to see.	Net út yn 'e iepen foar him te sjen.
Do you want it now?	Wolle jo it no?
It does not matter where you put him.	It makket neat út wêr't jo him sette.
She became very angry.	Se waard tige lilk.
I can not be the only one here.	Ik kin hjir net de iennichste wêze.
Good job!	Goed wurk!
If it's her idea to get in bed like that.	As is it har idee om sa op bêd te kommen.
However, they probably do not, probably never.	Hoe dan ek, se dogge it wierskynlik net, wierskynlik noait.
But there it is.	Mar dêr is it.
I the.	ik de.
If it has, well.	As it hat, goed.
I could not find her car.	Ik koe har auto net fine.
That's exactly the reason.	Dat is krekt de reden.
It's good for you.	It is goed foar dy.
I'm sure of it now.	Ik bin der no wis fan.
If you need anything.	As jo ​​​​wat nedich binne.
She's a good friend of mine.	Se is in goede freon fan my.
She is still only three years old.	Se is noch mar trije jier âld.
I know now that you never got it.	Ik wit no dat jo it noait krigen hawwe.
He has her around.	Hy hat har der om.
Nobody looks at me.	Nimmen sjocht my oan.
If they like it, so will you.	As se har leuk fine, sille jo ek.
All his life he had been afraid.	Syn hiele libben hie er bang west.
You will of course get more than that.	Jo sille fansels mear krije dan dat.
Tonight is no different.	Fannacht is net oars.
There was so little to see.	Der wie sa'n bytsje te sjen.
The latter with her mother.	It lêste mei har mem.
Really the place.	Echt it plak.
She thought he was not well.	Se tocht dat er net goed wie.
This is your doing.	Dit is dyn dwaan.
He did not seem happy.	Hy like net bliid.
It is not clear why he would think so.	It is net dúdlik wêrom't er dat tinke soe.
They do not have them.	Se hawwe se net.
He needed her right away.	Hy hie har fuort nedich.
But none of that was true.	Mar neat fan dat wie wier.
That would be ....	Dat soe ... wêze .
Nobody makes you go away.	Nimmen makket dy fuort.
He never looked again.	Hy seach noait wer.
Now my question.	No myn fraach.
You wonder what will happen to your life.	Jo freegje jo ôf wat der mei jo libben barre sil.
For some reason this does not happen.	Om ien of oare reden bart dat net.
This is such a great day for you.	Dit is sa'n grutte dei foar dy.
Let me give you another one.	Lit my dy noch ien jaan.
She could not stop now.	Se koe no net ophâlde.
He was a very busy man.	Hy wie in tige drok man.
It needs to be done.	It moat dien wurde.
If they think so, what are we going to do then?	As se dat tinke, wat sille wy dan dwaan.
Well, not exactly the same.	No, net krekt itselde.
But what were they different.	Mar wat wiene se oars.
We let him go there.	Wy litte him dêr by gean.
Do not sit either.	Sit ek net.
We have to pay for the food.	Wy moatte betelje foar it iten.
That leaves me alone.	Dat litte jo my oer.
He told me not to leave.	Hy fertelde my net fuort te gean.
It was just easy.	Dit wie net maklik.
He says of course you can.	Hy seit fansels dat jo kinne.
He would do it if he could.	Hy soe it dwaan as er koe.
Do not talk like that to me.	Praat net sa tsjin my.
Not for everyone.	Net foar elkenien.
Well, this looks good.	No, dit sjocht der goed út.
And those are my parents.	En dat binne myn âlden.
That's just like what you would do.	Dat is krekt as wat jo soene dwaan.
I did not really have a reason.	Ik hie net echt in reden.
It's not that hard.	It is net sa dreech.
This way please.	Dizze manier asjebleaft.
See where it is.	Sjoch wêr't it is.
She said nothing.	Se sei neat.
That's the kind of person he is.	Dat is it soarte fan persoan hy is.
Another day or two, probably.	Noch in dei as twa, wierskynlik.
I do not know his name.	Ik wit syn namme net.
This must be.	Dit moat wêze.
You can agree or disagree.	Jo kinne it iens of net iens wêze.
What was it really.	Wat wie it echt.
He had done that a lot.	Hy hie dat in protte dien.
That he needed her more.	Dat er har mear nedich hie.
He's glad the work is done.	Hy is bliid dat it wurk klear is.
That's it, he says.	Dat is it sa, seit er sels.
He goes back to bed.	Hy giet werom op bêd.
But it is not even talked about.	Mar der wurdt net iens oer praat.
This is a photo of your new home.	Dit is in foto fan jo nije hûs.
Not the girl.	Net it famke.
If only he did not like her so much.	As er har mar net sa graach woe.
Let's take them one by one.	Litte wy se ien foar ien nimme.
Girl, why did not you wake me up earlier?	Famke, wêrom hast my net earder wekker?
I always thought it was beautiful.	Ik tocht altyd dat it moai wie.
He knows who he is.	Hy wit wa't er is.
He looked at me.	Hy seach my oan.
This happens to me.	Dit bart ek.
There is just question about that right now.	Der is no krekt fraach oer.
It is not so.	It is net sa.
I have an idea.	Ik haw in idee.
My mom did those things.	Myn mem die dy dingen.
Planning to stay a few days?	Plan om in pear dagen te bliuwen?
He could tell she was not ready.	Hy koe fertelle dat se net klear wie.
In fact, it was almost a year ago.	Eins is it hast in jier lyn.
He is whole and true.	Hy is hiel en wier.
I agree, even the family too.	Ik mei iens, sels de famylje ek.
And he was as good as his word.	En hy wie sa goed as syn wurd.
We need to get money.	Wy moatte jild krije.
She was not good at being alone.	Se wie net goed om allinnich te wêzen.
Everyone got the same opportunity.	Elkenien krige deselde kâns.
You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.	Do bist it bêste dat my oait bard is.
He was sure.	Hy wie wis.
That money is hard to get.	Dat jild is dreech te krijen.
Everyone needs to talk to me.	Elkenien moat mei my prate.
He stayed at home all day.	Hy bleau de hiele dei thús.
This works very well.	Dit wurket hiel goed.
They never agreed.	Se binne it noait oer iens wurden.
I would like.	Ik soe graach wolle.
I think she wanted me to help her get something from someone.	Ik tink dat se woe dat ik har helpe om wat fan immen te krijen.
And that has happened in the past.	En dat is yn it ferline bard.
A lot of that.	In protte fan dat.
He was convinced.	Hy waard oertsjûge.
Well done.	Goed dien.
What things to do.	Wat dingen te dwaan.
It's good now.	It is no goed.
Then she would tell him she loved him.	Dan soe se him fertelle dat se fan him hâlde.
It's not for nothing.	It is net foar neat.
He would not say a word.	Hy soe gjin wurd sizze.
And you're first.	En do bist earste.
I believe this girl.	Ik leau dit famke.
It could be better.	It kin better.
But this is what he did.	Mar dit is wat er dien hat.
It should be done in young children.	It moat dien wurde yn jonge bern.
If she needs your help, give it.	As se jo help nedich hat, jou it dan.
Or for mine.	Of foar myn.
Give it a year or two.	Jou it in jier as twa.
As a couple.	As in pear.
I was nothing and nobody.	Ik wie neat en nimmen.
It can not.	It kin net.
He was never worried about this kind of thing.	Hy wie nea dreech oer dit soarte fan dingen.
But he must believe it.	Mar hy moat it leauwe.
And then the door would open.	En dan soe de doar iepen.
Know that I want to too.	Wit dat ek wol.
In fact, the alarm clock goes off every hour.	Eins giet de wekker alle oeren.
They are the best things in my life.	Se binne de bêste dingen yn myn libben.
Anyone who wants it will really have to try it.	Elkenien dy't it wol, sil it echt besykje moatte.
Is there anyone who can, please?	Is der immen dy't kin, asjebleaft?
He speaks to me, man to man.	Hy praat tsjin my, man tsjin man.
Have what you asked for.	Haw wat jo frege om.
Be better this week.	Wês better dizze wike.
, and his family.	, en syn famylje.
I did not want to tell you.	Ik woe it dy net fertelle.
It must be true.	It moat wier wêze.
That man seems to be out of hand.	Dy man liket út de hân te wêzen.
I certainly never did.	Ik wis nea dien.
And they know what life was like with him.	En se witte hoe't it libben wie mei him.
This year it was different.	Dit jier wie it oars.
I'll see you next week.	Ik sjoch dy takom wike.
I can put it through.	Ik kin it troch sette.
We are here.	Wy binne hjir.
That's when you think of bed.	Dat is as jo tinke oan bêd.
She had nothing to go on.	Se hie neat te gean.
I feel sick.	Ik fiel my siik.
He made her believe in a home and forever.	Hy liet har leauwe yn in hûs en foar altyd.
See what happens then.	Sjoch wat der dan bart.
If you like them, please let me know why.	As jo ​​​​se leuk fine, lit my dan witte wêrom.
I'm taking this.	Ik nim dit.
You will not get it right the first time.	Jo sille it de earste kear net goed krije.
There should be enough.	Der moat genôch wêze.
But she is different.	Mar se is oars.
You have to be very careful.	Jo moatte tige foarsichtich wêze.
Well, that may not be true.	No, dat kin net wier wêze.
But you have to get away.	Mar jo moatte fuort.
My friends were worried.	Myn freonen wiene soargen.
He would not make it.	Hy soe it net meitsje.
All my friends will be able to come and stay.	Al myn freonen sille kinne komme en bliuwe.
I can 't talk about it, ever.	Ik kin der net oer prate, noait.
Sit down with us, and tell us what you know.	Sit by ús, en fertel ús wat jo witte.
When exactly did he arrive?	Wannear kaam er krekt?
Many things affect us.	In protte dingen dogge ús oan.
It did not matter what she told him.	It makke neat út wat se him fertelde.
I would never have asked her to come with me.	Ik soe har nea frege hawwe om mei my te kommen.
Water it well.	Wetter it goed yn.
We'll have to leave something else in its place.	Wy sille wat oars yn har plak litte moatte.
, en.	, en.
I'll show you why.	Ik lit dy sjen wêrom.
Just do it.	Doch it gewoan.
It seemed to him so.	It like him sa.
But let's not talk about it.	Mar lit ús der net oer prate.
That we can have.	Dat kinne wy ​​hawwe.
I needed you there.	Ik hie dy dêr nedich.
What would it do once for him and twice for her.	Wat soe it ien kear foar him meitsje en twa kear foar har.
He never had a chance to ride it.	Hy hie nea in kâns om it te riden.
But it does not matter.	Mar it makket neat út.
In the name of faith.	Yn 'e namme fan it leauwe.
I'm in really big trouble.	Ik sit yn echt grutte problemen.
Maybe it's not true.	Miskien is it net wier.
That you know it was good.	Dat jo witte dat it goed wie.
That was a few years ago.	Dat wie in pear jier lyn.
He's so good.	Hy is sa goed.
What do you think?	Wat tinksto?
Does not matter which.	Makket net út hokker.
We're in there.	Wy binne der yn.
That seems like a good idea at first.	Dat liket earst in goed idee.
You want people to want to help you.	Jo wolle dat minsken jo wolle helpe.
We are your family now.	Wy binne no dyn famylje.
But the other time.	Mar de oare kear.
Nobody wanted to come to him.	Nimmen woe by him komme.
This is my whole life.	Dit is myn hiele libben.
We were careful though.	Wy wiene wol foarsichtich.
He came around.	Hy kaam om.
They just weren't there.	Se wiene der gewoan net.
For a bit.	Foar in bytsje.
Anyone can see what it is.	Elkenien kin sjen wat it is.
He looks after his children.	Hy sjocht nei syn bern.
She was happy about that.	Dêr wie se bliid fan.
We love so, so much of you.	Wy hâlde sa, sa folle fan dy.
Let's talk about the whole thing.	Lit ús prate oer it hiele ding.
We can not agree with that now.	Wy kinne der no net iens mei.
But he never came.	Mar hy kaam nea.
We will stop.	Wy sille ophâlde.
That's it.	Dat die se.
I participate myself.	Ik doch sels mei.
I feel confident about this.	Ik fiel my wis oer dit.
There was just.	Der wie gewoan.
I said that before.	Dat sei ik earder.
I have no problems anymore.	Ik haw gjin problemen mear.
What you think becomes you.	Wat jo tinke, wurdt jo.
Who did this?	Wa hat dit dien?
Not even for you.	Net iens foar dy.
But we have to keep them here.	Mar wy moatte se hjir hâlde.
I will find the right way.	Ik sil de goede wei fine.
He has been there twice.	Hy hat der twa kear west.
That may have something to do with it.	Dat kin der wat mei te krijen hawwe.
But try it out.	Mar besykje it op.
Maybe he would see them soon.	Miskien soe er se gau sjen.
The only thing was, he did not want to leave.	It ienige ding wie, hy woe net fuort.
Well, glad you asked.	No, bliid dat jo frege hawwe.
She would be a woman.	Se soe in frou wêze.
Join us and see us again soon.	Kom by ús en sjoch ús gau wer.
Started this today.	Begûn dit hjoed.
But then something happens.	Mar dan bart der wat.
They could not, would not be able to help him.	Se koene net, soene him net helpe kinne.
Maybe at another time.	Miskien op in oare tiid.
I hope she did not get in trouble.	Ik hoopje dat se net yn de problemen kaam.
The couple had no children.	It pear hie gjin bern.
When we have more, it's never enough.	As wy mear hawwe, is it noait genôch.
This is not good, they set us up.	Dit is net goed, se sette ús op.
But you have to stay here.	Mar jo moatte hjir bliuwe.
He was almost there.	Hy wie der hast.
It can work.	It kin wurkje.
He had three children.	Hy hie trije bern.
Not bad work.	Net min wurk.
She's nice.	Se is aardich.
No one came out.	Gjinien kaam út.
I thought it was you.	Ik tocht dat it dy wie.
She felt scared for her life.	Se fielde bang foar har libben.
We'll get into trouble soon.	Wy komme gau yn de problemen.
I felt good.	Ik fielde my goed.
He was still.	Hy wie noch altyd.
I do not know where.	Ik wit net wêr.
You work late together.	Jo wurkje let tegearre.
He just hurt.	Hy die gewoan sear.
The door opened.	De doar gie iepen.
I know there's good in you.	Ik wit dat d'r goed yn jo is.
The problem is just its size.	It probleem is gewoan syn grutte.
And he worried her.	En hy makke har soargen.
But it will not happen.	Mar it sil net barre.
You have two years.	Jo hawwe twa jier.
Life goes on .	It libben giet troch .
Well, he was right here.	No, hy wie hjir krekt.
It didn’t matter, really.	It makke neat út, echt.
She walked over to him.	Se rûn nei him ta.
They need to talk.	Se moatte prate.
Came out really well.	Kaam út echt goed.
Is this a bad person?	Is dit in min persoan?
Not just for me but for you too.	Net allinnich foar my mar ek foar dy.
It's not the right time.	It is net de goede tiid.
We are together all day.	Wy binne de hiele dei tegearre.
But even that was not enough.	Mar ek dat wie net genôch.
Min.	Min.
It was not so much in itself.	It wie net sa folle yn himsels.
That's what's going on.	Dat is wat der oan de hân is.
There's something going on, but we do not know what.	Der is wat oan 'e hân, mar wy witte net wat.
The best day of my whole life.	De bêste dei fan myn hiele libben.
No one ever knew why it happened.	Nimmen wist oait wêrom it barde.
She had a hard time saying right from wrong.	Se hie it dreech om goed fan ferkeard te sizzen.
That was right.	Dat wie krekt.
Then maybe get a life.	Dan miskien in libben krije.
That probably seems wrong to me.	Dat liket my wierskynlik ferkeard.
Just an easy thing to do.	Net in maklik ding om te dwaan.
That, they did what he said.	Dat, se diene wat er sein hie.
I made it up.	Ik makke it op.
My job is what happens.	Myn wurk is wat der bart.
Something else is happening here.	Der bart hjir wat oars.
The money is coming up soon!	It jild komt gau op!
One thing for sure.	Ien ding foar wis.
This guy came in.	Dizze keardel kaam yn.
Of course, they were wrong.	Fansels wiene se ferkeard.
I do not like to talk.	Ik hâld net fan praten.
Of course they had enough food.	Fansels hiene se genôch iten.
And we're still waiting.	En wy wachtsje noch.
This is such a good book.	Dit is sa'n goed boek.
Who knows why.	Wa wit wêrom.
He wanted to do it, but he wanted to be sure.	Hy woe it dwaan, mar hy woe der wis fan wêze.
But there was nothing.	Mar der wie neat.
Come to us.	Kom nei ús ta.
Now there is not.	No is der net.
It would never happen.	It soe nea barre.
What you might think.	Wat jo miskien tinke.
We reach out to everyone.	Wy komme nei elkenien oan.
By his father.	Troch syn heit.
But that is now ready.	Mar dat is no klear.
Everything this dog wanted, it was his.	Alles wat dizze hûn woe, it wie syn.
I took this as a good thing of course.	Ik naam dit fansels as in goed ding.
We will be ready to go again.	Wy sille wêze klear om te gean wer.
Nobody wants to get hurt.	Nimmen wol sear wurde.
I can not tell how it was.	Ik kin net fertelle hoe't it wie.
This seems good to me.	Dit liket my goed.
It was about the net.	It wie oer it net.
She had said it herself.	Se hie it sels sein.
If it's nothing, it's nothing.	As it neat is, is it neat.
I'm too old and scared to go through with it.	Ik bin te âld en bang om dêr troch te gean.
I got my chance.	Ik krige myn kâns.
I do not believe that anymore.	Dat leau ik net mear.
Not out there are you.	Net út dêr binne jo.
It did not matter to me.	It makke my neat út.
I would watch that movie.	Ik soe dy film sjen.
You are not them, and they are not you.	Jo binne net se, en se binne net dy.
She gave nothing.	Se joech neat.
She did not know what to do.	Se wist net wat se dwaan moast.
He said he needed her help.	Hy sei dat er har help nedich hie.
But the place was still sore.	Mar it plak wie noch sear.
The week was beautiful, the weekend not.	De wike wie moai, it wykein net.
They hoped there was a place.	Se hope dat der in plak wie.
I want to be so bad there.	Ik wol der sa min wêze.
And the other children.	En de oare bern.
He must be told it is there.	Hy moat sein wurde dat it der is.
Who knows what it might be.	Wa wit wat it wurde kin.
This photo does not look like you.	Dizze foto liket net op dy.
Talk to a person.	Praat mei in persoan.
I'm sure she would not either.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se ek net soe.
I just have to tell you.	Ik moat it dy mar fertelle.
And this was such a day.	En dit wie sa'n dei.
.	.
It is easy to find out what happened.	It is maklik om út te finen wat der bard is.
It is open all year round.	It is it hiele jier iepen.
It did not come.	It kaam net.
That's not so easy.	Dat is net sa maklik.
From the man himself.	Fan de man sels.
There was no way to go back.	Der wie gjin manier om werom te gean.
I don't believe.	Ik leau it net.
She really wanted to know.	Se woe eins witte.
I would love to have a three day weekend.	Ik soe graach hawwe in trije dagen wykein.
That was my last.	Dat wie myn lêste.
Or if they did, they were not his friends.	Of as se diene wiene se net syn freonen.
Have money, have everything.	Hawwe jild, hawwe alles.
There is still.	Der is noch.
You want nothing to do with him.	Jo wolle neat mei him te krijen hawwe.
It was like one big family.	It wie as ien grutte famylje.
And maybe there was more.	En miskien wie der mear.
She was still looking at us.	Se seach noch nei ús.
It is not easy to oppose something.	It is net maklik om wat tsjin te gean.
He's not that tall.	Hy is net sa lang.
Where you have been, he says, does not matter.	Wêr't jo west hawwe, seit er, makket neat út.
He knew he could not last this long.	Hy wist dat er dit net lang hâlde koe.
Do not take more than	Nim net mear as
And even never knew it.	En sels noait wist it.
But today is not a good day.	Mar hjoed is gjin goede dei.
We are not ready yet.	Wy binne noch net klear.
Let him work for everything.	Lit him foar alles wurkje.
You love the truth.	Jo hâlde fan 'e wierheid.
It's a real place.	It is in echt plak.
Saying things, but not really saying them.	Dingen sizze, mar se net echt sizze.
If we know how to look.	As wy witte hoe te sjen.
You ask if you can talk to me.	Jo freegje oft jo mei my prate kinne.
Even if you felt you had to.	Sels as jo fielde dat jo moatte.
I do not buy it!	Ik keapje it net!
But she did not feel it.	Mar se fielde it net.
That was my name.	Dat wie myn namme.
We'll find him.	Wy sille him fine.
She would wait.	Se soe wachtsje.
They have been to school, they have worked.	Se hawwe nei skoalle west, se hawwe wurke.
We can not say them better than we can.	Wy kinne se net better sizze as wy se kinne.
So they had always been, the two.	Sa hiene se altyd west, de twa.
It was never pretty.	It wie noait moai.
Or whatever, really.	Of wat dan ek, echt.
But hope is not to have.	Mar hoopje is net te hawwen.
Told him to stop.	Sei him ophâlde.
She herself does not know it, of course.	Se wit it sels fansels net.
He's not going out anymore.	Hy giet net mear út.
Nothing was a problem.	Neat wie in probleem.
They never had a day off.	Se hiene nea in dei frij.
We love that.	Dy hâlde wy fan.
We would love your help on that.	Wy soene graach jo help op dat.
But you take care of me.	Mar jo soargje foar my.
Ready to join her.	Klear om mei te dwaan har.
I think he sees it better.	Ik tink dat hy it better sjocht.
We'll find it.	Wy sille it fine.
You will be able to see how hard we work.	Jo sille sjen kinne hoe hurd wy wurkje.
We must then be ready.	Wy moatte dan klear wêze.
It gave us that opportunity.	It joech ús dy kâns.
We buy things we do not need.	Wy keapje dingen dy't wy net nedich binne.
I walked in here.	Ik rûn hjir yn.
It looks much better.	It sjocht der folle better út.
It was a good talk.	It wie in goed praat.
They knew it was coming.	Se wisten dat it soe kommen.
They do nothing.	Se dogge neat.
My husband would never stop that.	Myn man soe dat noait ophâlde.
Came back a year ago.	In jier lyn kaam werom.
Or to all three.	Of oan alle trije.
He can not do that.	Dat kin er net.
He does the work for you.	Hy docht it wurk foar jo.
This is due to the following reason.	Dit komt troch de folgjende reden.
And asked you what you did.	En frege dy wat jo diene.
He was with his wife and family.	Hy wie mei syn frou en famylje.
Here we go.	Hjir geane wy.
So he ran as hard as he could.	Sa rûn er sa hurd as er koe.
I did not want to.	Ik woe net.
On a book.	Op in boek.
I heard it.	Ik hearde it.
I have to tell you.	Ik moat it dy fertelle.
He did not want to see that.	Dat woe er net sjen.
Okay, he has to.	Goed, hy moat.
They would want something from me first.	Se soene earst wat fan my wolle.
It's just who you are.	It is gewoan wa't jo binne.
It should not be difficult to find.	It soe net dreech te finen wêze moatte.
It was hard to say how old she was.	It wie dreech om te sizzen hoe âld se wie.
A little is good.	In bytsje is goed.
The ones you have now.	Dejinge dy't jo no hawwe.
There is so much we need to do together.	D'r is safolle dat wy tegearre moatte dwaan.
We're leaving.	Wy geane fuort.
We're not done with you yet.	Wy binne noch net klear mei dy.
And they come back.	En se komme werom.
Try not to figure it out.	Besykje it net út te finen.
He was sitting in the car.	Hy siet yn de auto.
Nothing that will do the same.	Neat dat sil dwaan itselde.
It's a big hope.	It is in grutte hope.
I wondered how it was that she had it.	Ik frege my ôf hoe't it wie dat se it hie.
She had gone and done it now.	Se wie gien en dien it no.
They clearly do not.	Dat dogge se dúdlik net.
They had not yet spoken to him.	Se hiene noch net mei him hoege te praten.
Well, maybe it did.	No, miskien hat it dien.
I work hard now.	Ik wurkje no hurd.
Everything should be fine now.	Alles moat no goed komme.
We had our chance.	Wy hiene ús kâns.
She could not take it anymore and did not want to.	Se koe it net mear en woe net.
This guy is nice.	Dizze man is aardich.
We could work here.	Wy koene hjir wurkje.
Or do not believe in it.	Of leau der net yn.
She will wait, and wait for it.	Se sil wachtsje, en wachtsje op it.
He let you do what you have to do.	Hy liet jo dwaan wat jo moatte dwaan.
He works with me to get it from me.	Hy wurket mei my om it by my te krijen.
And it is now or never.	En it is no of nea.
And he would keep it on her.	En hy soe it op har hâlde.
Of course not to me.	Fansels net nei my ta.
We take it out.	Wy nimme it út.
But this does not happen.	Mar dit bart net.
It happens to many.	It bart mei in protte.
She always does it well.	Se docht it altyd goed.
I should have known better than to love him.	Ik hie better witte moatten as it fan him te hâlden.
But now it is different.	Mar no is it oars.
It's been good.	It is goed west.
I'll pay for it.	Ik sil it betelje.
It's her who he really loves.	It is har fan wa't er echt hâldt.
We can get it down.	Wy kinne it ûnder krije.
I really do not know.	Ik wit it echt net.
We will never do that again.	Dat sille wy nea wer dwaan.
I had to pay for it too.	Ik moast der ek foar betelje.
This can be good and bad.	Dit kin goed en min wêze.
So you can see why a letter is difficult for me.	Sa kinne jo sjen wêrom't in brief is dreech foar my.
Do not need it.	Hawwe it net nedich.
We can be here.	Wy kinne hjir wêze.
That should not be the case.	Dat moat net sa wêze.
He must have been wrong.	Hy moast ferkeard wêze.
It's one of those.	It is ien fan dy.
But he wants to take the right path.	Mar hy wol de goede wei nimme.
It can be anyone.	It kin elkenien wêze.
She left me with this.	Se liet my mei dit.
In the word it is.	Yn it wurd is it.
Pretend he's coming at them '.	Meitsje as soe er op har komme'.
Nice work with this.	Moai wurk mei dizze.
It works perfectly.	It wurket hielendal.
No one would tell me anything.	Nimmen soe my wat fertelle.
I do not know your life.	Ik ken dyn libben net.
I leave the car for you.	Ik lit de auto foar dy.
She did not see him.	Se seach him net.
We really needed the money.	Wy hiene it jild echt nedich.
Or so he told it.	Of sa fertelde er it.
It was not so long ago.	It wie noch net sa lang lyn.
Think of it this way.	Tink der sa oan.
I have nothing to worry about.	Ik haw neat te soargen oer.
The water is clear today.	It wetter is hjoed dúdlik.
I really tried.	Ik echt besocht.
In a way, it's true.	Op in manier is it wier.
She told me she was in her room.	Se fertelde my dat se yn har keamer wie.
Long, he had heard.	Lang, hie er heard.
She had never seen her before.	Se hie har noch noait earder sjoen.
If it is not, it is not.	As dit net is, is dat net.
Well, tell the truth.	No, fertel de wierheid.
We need more money.	Wy hawwe mear jild nedich.
It's where he met his best friends.	It is wêr't hy syn bêste freonen moete.
Now she had found one there.	No hie se der ien fûn.
Not without their help.	Net sûnder har help.
I know one thing.	Ik wit ien ding.
And now it works.	En no wurket it.
Tell me this.	Fertel my dit.
I'm sitting on it.	Ik sit derop.
Not with me, but with her.	Net mei my, mar mei har.
He did not want to look at her again.	Hy woe net wer nei har sjen.
He was so happy with himself.	Hy wie sa bliid mei himsels.
Not in here.	Net yn hjir.
You are nothing to me.	Do bist neat foar my.
In fact, there was none.	Eins wie der gjinien.
It never goes away.	It giet noait fuort.
There is no job after this.	Der is gjin baan nei dit.
To see him was to love him.	Om him te sjen wie fan him hâlde.
Your father came back?	Jo heit kaam werom?
Many believe.	In protte leauwe.
Can be a man, woman or child.	Kin in man, frou of bern wêze.
I thought tomorrow would work, but it has not yet.	Ik tocht moarn soe wurkje, mar it hat noch net.
It was not much.	It wie net folle.
She was not afraid of me.	Se wie net bang foar my.
So we did it for you.	Dat wy hawwe it foar jo dien.
I never asked.	Ik haw noait frege.
But we do not yet know how to do this.	Mar wy witte noch net hoe dit te dwaan.
I felt the young woman was angry at me.	Ik fielde dat de jonge frou lilk op my wie.
There was no letter for me.	Der wie gjin brief foar my.
They are clearly not the same thing.	Se binne dúdlik net itselde ding.
I want to say.	Ik wol sizze.
I have to pay here.	Ik moat hier betelje.
The word was his and his only.	It wurd wie syn en syn iennichste.
She did not get that.	Dat krige se net.
If you have no place to go, you can stay with us.	As jo ​​​​gjin plak hawwe om te gean, kinne jo by ús bliuwe.
Nothing comes out.	Der komt neat út.
But the teacher can not do it for you.	Mar de learaar kin it net foar jo dwaan.
Should not be so.	Moat net sa wêze.
I have to go first.	Ik moat earst gean.
To do this after was.	Om dit te dwaan nei wie.
There is something else at work.	Der is wat oars oan it wurk.
That might work.	Dat kin wurkje.
We had done it once and that was enough.	Wy hiene it ien kear dien en dat wie genôch.
We could not do that.	Dat koene wy ​​net.
They say everything is fine.	Se sizze dat alles goed is.
Good to see you again.	Goed dy wer te sjen.
They need him, with everything he has seen.	Se hawwe him nedich, mei alles wat er sjoen hat.
We were ready.	Wy wiene klear.
He knew what needed to be done.	Hy wist wat der dien wurde moast.
A man she never, ever wanted to see again.	In man dy't se noait, noait wer sjen woe.
And none of it was true.	En neat fan it wie wier.
No one was really scared.	Nimmen wie echt bang.
What would anyone who has never been there think?	Wat soe immen tinke dy't der noait west hie?
She just has no hand left.	Se hat gewoan gjin hân mear.
I'm going to bed again now.	Ik gean no wer op bêd.
I need to find something.	Ik moat wat fine.
He just thought he was.	Hy tocht gewoan dat hy wie.
Until it's too late.	Oant it te let is.
It may be too late now.	It kin no te let wêze.
It did to me, of course.	It die my fansels.
Not right now.	Net no krekt.
In that year.	Yn dat jier.
The work was almost finished.	It wurk wie hast klear.
It would be good to finish this morning.	It soe goed wêze om dit moarn ôf te meitsjen.
Think of me if you will.	Tink oan my as jo wolle.
If it's good, people will buy it.	As it goed is, sille minsken keapje.
They did not really hurt you.	Se hawwe jo net echt sear makke.
But that is him.	Mar dat is hy.
Whoever has more wants everything.	Wa't mear hat, wol alles.
We knew we were doing the right thing.	Wy wisten dat wy it goede ding diene.
It probably made him pretty sick.	It makke him wierskynlik aardich siik.
Not my truth.	Net myn wierheid.
Now they were here.	No wiene se hjir.
This was what they were for.	Dit wie wêr't se foar wiene.
I'm scared of this man.	Ik bin bang foar dizze man.
I know so much.	Ik wit safolle.
And tomorrow.	En moarn.
Either or not.	Of beide of net.
You can stay there.	Jo kinne dêr bliuwe.
She's ready for you, she said.	Se is klear foar dy, sei se.
He had been careful, he thought.	Hy hie foarsichtich west, tocht er.
He did not leave her.	Hy liet har net.
My husband is still sitting there with my father.	Myn man sit dêr noch by myn heit.
I hope it would be good.	Ik hope dat it goed wêze soe.
I've never been so angry, before or since, at a man.	Ik wie noch noait sa lilk, foar of sûnt, op in man.
Try it, you will see.	Besykje it, jo sille sjen.
None of this could have been told to anyone at the time.	Gjin fan dit koe immen hawwe ferteld dy op 'e tiid.
Never really done anything to us.	Nea echt wat oan ús dien.
They do not really know what kind of problems they are in.	Se witte net echt yn hokker soarte fan problemen se binne.
Maybe he will do it in truth.	Miskien sil er it yn wierheid dwaan.
Not so.	Net sa.
We'll see how it goes tomorrow.	Wy sille sjen hoe't it moarn giet.
I think there may be more to it than that.	Ik tink dat der mear oan it kin wêze as dat.
By ???????? 	By ????????
to his friend ????????.	oan syn freon ????????.
Before it's too late.	Foardat it te let is.
There is something for everyone here.	Der is hjir wat foar elkenien.
We can not even stop thinking about that.	Dêr kinne wy ​​net iens oan tinke litte litte.
I'm not your father.	Ik bin dyn heit net.
I could not, of course.	Ik koe net, fansels.
It's time to dump her and move on.	It is tiid om der mei oan te gean.
Do what you can to pay.	Doch wat jo kinne betelje.
One large room.	Ien grutte keamer.
It just does.	It docht gewoan.
Where do you think the child might be?	Wêr tinke jo dat it bern wêze kin?
I want nothing more from you.	Ik wol neat mear fan dy.
I do not know what to do.	Ik wit net wat te dwaan.
They are now.	Se binne no.
I think it's the way it should be done.	Ik tink dat it de manier is wêr't it dien wurde moat.
Please work with you.	Graach mei dy wurkje.
Talk about problems.	Praat oer problemen.
You can let it go.	Jo kinne it gean litte.
Go some.	Gean wat.
I love it all here.	Ik hâld it hjir allegear yn.
Look and see.	Sjoch en sjoch.
That, of course, she did not show.	Dat liet se fansels net sjen.
And they would probably need the help.	En se soene wierskynlik de help nedich hawwe.
And also a great one.	En ek in grutte.
Found it easy to get along with people.	Fûn it maklik om mei minsken om te gean.
It did not look bad.	It seach der net min út.
So we have seen.	Sa hawwe wy sjoen.
Well, you really are.	Goed, do bist echt.
But she knew me.	Mar se koe my.
He wants to win.	Hy wol winne.
It's not easy, people.	It is net maklik, minsken.
This did not look good.	Dizze seach net goed út.
He's not nice at all.	Hy is hielendal net leuk.
He just seemed interested in talking to me.	Hy like gewoan ynteressearre om mei my te praten.
My parents are fine.	Myn âlden binne goed.
The police arrived an hour ago.	De plysje kaam in oere lyn oan.
We do not have to buy.	Wy hoege net te keapjen.
These people have many children.	Dizze minsken hawwe in protte bern.
He heard his name speak.	Hy hearde syn namme praten.
The boy said he loved her.	De jonge sei dat er fan har hâlde.
And he would be free.	En hy soe frij wêze.
I knew it would work, and it did.	Ik wist dat it soe wurkje, en it die.
I was a boy that could not.	Ik wie in jonge, dat koe net.
Not yet.	No noch net.
He said absolutely nothing about the letter.	Hy sei hielendal neat oer it brief.
I think they are good.	Ik tink dat se goed binne.
There is new week again chance.	Der is nije wike wer kâns.
But they could not stay.	Mar se koene net bliuwe.
I did that, still not working.	Dat haw ik dien, noch wurke net.
These were his things.	Dit wiene syn dingen.
We love the word.	Wy hâlde fan it wurd.
I expected	Ik ferwachte
That's exactly what you get here.	Dat is krekt wat jo hjir krije.
Come and visit us.	Kom en besykje ús.
It all seemed ready to go, just like that.	It like allegear klear om te gean, krekt sa.
Of course you know.	Fansels witte jo.
That's not his job.	Dat is syn wurk net.
Tell no one about us.	Fertel nimmen oer ús.
She would win.	Se soe winne.
You do your job.	Jo dogge jo wurk.
He was sitting alone at the party.	Hy siet allinnich op it feest.
He does a good job.	Hy docht goed wurk.
It was not as if she could get into trouble anymore.	It wie net oft se mear yn de problemen komme koe.
I could never find anything to worry about.	Ik koe noait wat fine om oer te soargen.
It would just be for.	It soe gewoan wêze foar.
He asked me how school went today.	Hy frege my hoe't skoalle hjoed gie.
I'm not interested in that.	Ik bin der net ynteressearre yn.
I was glad to see her.	Ik wie bliid har te sjen.
You were done.	Jo wiene dien.
I'm too busy to go.	Ik bin te drok om te gean.
Let me know, must be fun !!!.	Lit my witte, moat leuk wêze!!!.
Well, everyone's happy.	No, elkenien is bliid.
They tell us to go back.	Se sizze ús om werom te gean.
That you and he will live here with us now.	Dat jo en hy hjir no by ús wenje sille.
You're not trying to hurt anyone.	Jo besykje gjinien sear te krijen.
See, he's not saying that's not true.	Sjoch, hy seit net dat dat net wier is.
I saw the name but thought nothing of it.	Ik seach de namme mar tocht der neat fan.
I needed you.	Ik hie dy nedich.
There were none of these things.	D'r wiene net ien fan dizze dingen.
I think the reason is clear.	Ik tink dat de reden dúdlik is.
And they do.	En dat dogge se.
The door opened cautiously.	De doar gie foarsichtich iepen.
They had nothing and needed everything.	Se hiene neat en hiene alles nedich.
It was hard to say.	It wie dreech te sizzen.
There are not many.	Der binne net folle.
It's not forever.	It is net foar altyd.
Who knows where the new week is.	Wa wit wêr't it nije wike is.
There was nothing.	Der wie neat.
He even came with the money.	Hy kaam sels mei it jild.
It was our thing.	It wie ús ding.
All this was probably true.	Dit alles wie wierskynlik wier.
You do not have to tell them.	Jo hoege se net te fertellen.
Of course you can tell us a little more about.	Fansels kinne jo ús wat mear fertelle oer.
That's the next job.	Dat is de folgjende baan.
That is exactly the problem.	Dat is krekt it probleem.
He's not here and he can not hurt you.	Hy is hjir net en hy kin jo net sear dwaan.
There's a work in progress.	Der is in wurk om.
He had been there.	Hy hie der west.
Mine no longer looks like this photo.	Myn liket net mear op dizze foto.
That was just the right thing to say.	Dat wie krekt it goede om te sizzen.
I'm here for you too.	Ik bin hjir ek foar dy.
She felt she had to be sick.	Se fielde dat se siik wêze moast.
We need to make time.	Wy moatte tiid meitsje.
Of course, I could not stop there.	Dêr koe ik fansels net ophâlde.
It came to that.	It kaam sa ta.
It does not seem so.	It liket net sa.
She worried him.	Se makke him soargen.
I know it's bad for me.	Ik wit dat it min foar my is.
This is not my life.	Dit is myn libben net.
I'm getting out of the way.	Ik kom út 'e wei.
I also know it's good for him.	Ik wit ek dat it goed foar him is.
You will never come back.	Jo komme noait werom.
It worked or it did not.	It wurke of it die net.
But everything else too.	Mar al it oare ek.
People are already going there.	Minsken geane der al hinne.
I am tired.	Ik bin wurch.
He had seen him before too.	Hy hie him ek al earder sjoen.
Take my Hand!	Nim myn Hân!
He had thought she wanted the same thing he did.	Hy hie tocht dat se itselde woe dat hy die.
But he did it.	Mar hy die it.
There is no problem with that.	Dêr is gjin probleem mei.
I asked her about it today.	Ik frege har der hjoed nei.
He needs to know.	Hy moat it witte.
We need to do the same.	Wy moatte itselde dwaan.
But we have to.	Mar wy moatte.
It should be expected.	It moat ferwachte wurde.
It went in.	It gie yn.
I just wanted to make sure that was there.	Ik woe gewoan soargje dat dat der wie.
For her help around the house.	Foar har help om it hûs.
There was nothing in it.	Der siet neat yn.
He did not know when was enough.	Hy wist net wannear genôch wie.
Well, get out of that bed.	No, kom út dat bêd.
This must also be done.	Dit moat ek dien wurde.
He did not know what else to do.	Hy wist net wat er oars dwaan moast.
She knew it was true.	Se wist dat it wier wie.
We were there for a long time.	Wy wiene der lang.
Of course it can.	Fansels kin it.
Suffice it to say, it works.	It is genôch om te sizzen, it wurket.
Only not so happy.	Allinnich net sa bliid.
We would not want that to happen to you.	Dat soene wy ​​dy net barre wolle.
The school said she could work as a teacher.	De skoalle sei dat se as learaar wurkje koe.
He was not.	Hy wier net.
Please help us !.	Help ús asjebleaft!.
This is how she is with me.	Dit is hoe't se mei my is.
This is true today as never before.	Dit is hjoed wier as nea earder.
Everything went so well.	Alles gie sa goed.
A few months, now.	In pear moanne, no.
He liked to talk to this girl.	Hy mocht graach mei dit famke prate.
It happened almost last year.	It barde ferline jier hast.
'hand.	' hân.
I do not agree with that.	Ik bin it der net mei iens.
It can not be otherwise.	It kin net oars as wêze.
However, my question is this.	Hoe dan ek, myn fraach is dit.
He's still here.	Hy is hjir noch.
We should actually go for that.	Dêr soene wy ​​eins nei moatte gean.
I did not even know it was still there.	Ik wist net iens dat it der noch wie.
And then some more driving.	En dan noch wat riden.
I still remember seeing her.	Ik wit noch dat ik har seach.
They did not get one.	Se krigen net ien.
But he stayed.	Mar hy bleau.
There is nothing else.	Der is neat oars.
I just thought you might know.	Ik tocht krekt dat jo miskien witte.
But said die and he left her.	Mar se die en hy liet har.
That's what I would like.	Dat soe ik graach wolle.
The man they met.	De man dy't se moete.
It's wanted her for so long.	Dit woe se al sa lang.
There was not much reason to.	Der wie net folle reden ta.
I had become such a person.	Ik wie sa'n persoan wurden.
You can work where you want and when you want.	Jo kinne wurkje wêr't jo wolle en wannear jo wolle.
And now it came here again.	En no kaam it hjir wer.
And you know it too.	En jo witte it ek.
But we love him.	Mar wy hâlde fan him.
They do not even talk about it.	Dêr prate se net iens oer.
There is no one there.	Dêr is gjinien.
He had seen us, seen something.	Hy hie ús sjoen, wat sjoen.
Those days are done.	Dy dagen binne dien.
They became interested in him.	Se rekke ynteressearre yn him.
Do not worry, it can see.	Sit gjin soargen, it kin sjen.
And much more when my kids were home.	En noch folle mear doe't myn bern thús wiene.
I love how you want to make me a better man.	Ik hâld fan hoe't jo my in bettere man meitsje wolle.
Please help us help them.	Help ús asjebleaft har te helpen.
I'll be sure of that.	Ik sil der wis fan wêze.
And away we go.	En fuort geane wy.
Anyone can do it.	Elkenien kin it dwaan.
But she is wrong, so very wrong.	Mar se is ferkeard, sa heul ferkeard.
I'll be here no matter what happens.	Ik sil hjir wêze, wat der ek bart.
I had never seen such a thing in my life.	Ik hie noch noait yn myn libben sa'n ding sjoen.
I just can not live with it.	Ik kin der gewoan net oan wenne.
The next car leaves.	De folgjende auto giet fuort.
He tried to help the child.	Hy besocht it bern te helpen.
Nobody goes there.	Nimmen giet dêr.
I asked her to take me back.	Ik frege har om my werom te nimmen.
It did not seem like what she was saying.	It like der net út wat se sei.
Last week nothing happened.	Ferline wike is der neat bard.
Everyone, even the kids, had a job to do.	Elkenien, sels de bern, hiene in baan te dwaan.
Life has not been easy for me.	It libben hat my net maklik west.
Tell me more about this city.	Fertel my mear oer dizze stêd.
She knew exactly how that felt.	Se wist krekt hoe't dat fielde.
Maybe there is.	Miskien is der.
It's not that it's a bad idea.	It is net dat it in min idee is.
I feel things.	Ik fiel dingen.
He must have gone back to his room.	Hy moat werom gien wêze nei syn keamer.
She walked by and did not look back.	Se rûn troch en seach net werom.
All this together.	Dit alles tegearre.
But it has to be the good people.	Mar it moat de goede minsken wêze.
She had no idea what to do next.	Se hie gjin idee wat se dan dwaan moast.
I wanted to see if anyone would tell me first.	Ik woe sjen oft immen it my earst fertelle soe.
I do not.	ik net.
I got better.	Ik waard better.
That may be his favorite.	Dat kin syn favorite wêze.
She was very busy.	Se wie tige drok.
Nothing worked.	Neat hat wurke.
Never had a problem before.	Nea hie probleem earder.
Tell me what you think of the room !.	Fertel my wat jo tinke fan 'e keamer!.
We have worked.	Wy hawwe wurke.
It's for the best.	It is foar it bêste.
Simply, here you are.	Gewoan, hjir binne jo.
Look out soon.	Sjoch der gau út.
This is the best day ever.	Dit is de bêste dei ea.
Or you want to be with your family.	Of jo wolle by jo famylje wêze.
Where is his office.	Wêr is syn kantoar.
She was no great help.	Se wie gjin grutte help.
And he would go too.	En hy soe ek gean.
We will be nothing again.	Wy sille wer neat wêze.
Both should be tried together.	Beide moatte tegearre besocht wurde.
If you're free, come on.	As jo ​​​​frij binne, kom dan.
We know that now.	Dat witte wy no wol.
And now you.	En no dy.
They had him.	Se hiene him.
He had never even had it.	Hy hie it sels noait hân.
But they get you.	Mar se krije dy.
This book is just that and it does it well.	Dit boek is krekt dat en it docht it goed.
That's what she had told him.	Dat hie se him sein.
He had worked so hard!	Hy hie sa hurd wurke!
He stayed three months.	Hy bleau trije moanne.
We have not done anything wrong.	Wy hawwe gjin ferkeard dien.
I talk a lot about hair.	Ik praat in protte oer hier.
It shouldn’t either.	It soe ek net moatte.
Or a friend.	Of in freon.
Who was really good.	Wie echt goed.
You can too.	Jo kinne ek.
I do not know how you can ever get away.	Ik wit net hoe't jo oait fuort kinne.
For me, there was really no reason to worry.	Foar my wie d'r echt gjin reden om soargen te wêzen.
We will leave these problems to another time.	Wy litte dizze problemen nei in oare tiid.
But he has an idea.	Mar hy hat in idee.
I did not ask her about it.	Ik frege har der net oer.
I had a word.	Ik hie in wurd.
He wanted money.	Hy woe jild.
It was time to go.	It wie tiid om te gean.
Let them never believe that it will be easy to get what they want.	Lit se nea leauwe dat it maklik sil wêze om te krijen wat se wolle.
Same with my mom.	Itselde mei myn mem.
The work was finished in one day.	It wurk wie yn in dei klear.
It does open it up.	It docht it iepen.
Let me not go back there.	Lit my der net werom gean.
So, we had a lot of food to take home.	Sa, wy hiene in protte iten mei nei hûs.
That did it.	Dat die it.
I can.	Ik kin wol.
Make a plan.	In plan meitsje.
Also not true.	Ek net wier.
But you have to be ready.	Mar jo moatte klear wêze.
And here you have them.	En hjir hawwe jo se.
But that was not quite what happened here.	Mar dat wie net hielendal wat hjir barde.
I agree with you.	Ik bin it mei dy iens.
I would like nothing more.	Ik soe graach neat mear.
He thinks of nothing but work.	Hy tinkt oan neat oars as wurk.
She arrived earlier than usual.	Se kaam earder oan as oars.
I think on a day to day basis it must be yours.	Ik tink op 'e dei ta dei it moat wêze dyn.
Someone as old as he is should have known this.	Immen sa âld as er is hie dit witte moatten.
Who were these people?	Wa wiene dizze minsken?
I met my husband.	Ik moete myn man.
Love someone, love something.	Hâld fan immen, hâld fan wat.
That she should know before she goes back to the city.	Dat moat se witte foardat se werom nei de stêd gie.
Well, let me pay.	No, lit my betelje.
She found that she was alone in the house.	Se fûn dat se allinnich yn it hûs wie.
The child is the father of the man, perhaps.	It bern is de heit fan 'e man, miskien.
You have to pay.	Jo moatte betelje.
Who lives there in that house?	Wa wennet dêr yn dat hûs?
I am sorry.	It spyt my.
I want to be free.	Ik wol frij wêze.
I know nothing of you.	Ik wit neat fan dy.
It is up to them to give and take and no one else.	It is har om te jaan en te nimmen en gjinien oars.
Be interested in something.	Wês ynteressearre yn wat.
I hope it will be sooner.	Ik hoopje dat it earder sil wêze.
It's not coming back.	It komt net werom.
I could no longer see it in him.	Ik koe it net mear oan him sjen.
It was also not exactly true.	It wie ek net krekt wier.
Do not worry about anything.	Sit gjin soargen oer neat.
He is only one man.	Hy is mar ien man.
They may or may not be out, but most likely they are.	Se kinne of miskien net út wêze, mar wierskynlik binne se.
He's not really like that, of course.	Hy is net echt sa, fansels.
Do not make me sick.	Meitsje my net siik.
It's not about doing exactly the same thing you did.	It giet net om krekt itselde te dwaan as jo dien hawwe.
That is more than enough.	Dat is mear as genôch.
This can be good with you.	Dit kin wêze goed mei dy.
Shall we go to the movie?	Sille wy nei de film gean?
If you want something, work for it.	As jo ​​​​wat wolle, wurkje dan foar.
I know it's in me too.	Ik wit dat it ek yn my is.
What you think is the truth.	Wat jo tinke is de wierheid.
Please purchase the book.	Keapje asjebleaft it boek.
It's not that we do not like you.	It is net dat wy dy net leuk fine.
She still has plenty of time.	Se hat noch genôch tiid.
But there is more.	Mar der is mear.
Lots of things to talk about.	In protte dingen om oer te praten.
I hope it will.	Ik hoopje dat it sil.
I could be wrong. 	Ik koe ferkeard wêze. 
And so it happened.	En sa barde it sa.
A year ago.	In jier lyn.
That had to be the best of these days.	Dat moast it bêste wêze fan dizze dagen.
In other words, it could.	Mei oare wurden, it koe.
It's not life for you.	It is gjin libben foar dy.
Not sure why we need two of those.	Net wis wêrom't wy twa fan dy nedich binne.
He's the only boy in the room.	Hy is de ienige jonge yn 'e keamer.
He did not want to give it to him.	Hy woe him net jaan.
Hope you are fine.	Hoopje dat jo goed binne.
You need help.	Do hast help nedich.
Then they are gone.	Dan binne se fuort.
That's exactly what's going on.	Dat is krekt wat der oan de hân wie.
But we think these were good.	Mar wy tinke dat dizze wiene goed.
I'm not him.	Ik bin net him.
Soon enough my friend.	Gau genôch myn freon.
He looked at a photo of his wife and children.	Hy seach nei in foto fan syn frou en bern.
I know that city.	Ik ken dy stêd.
This is my lake.	Dit is myn mar.
To so many.	Oan safolle.
No time for that now.	Dêr no gjin tiid foar.
It was not pretty.	It wie net moai.
You're doing it right.	Jo dogge it goed.
What he just the!	Wat hy net die!
That was not the question.	Dat wie net de fraach.
She was so happy!	Se wie sa bliid!
He's been here ever since.	Hy is hjir sûnt dy tiid.
And this works.	En dit wurket.
It does not matter.	It makket neat út.
But they can say something.	Mar se kinne wat sizze.
Just as hard.	Like hurd.
I did it for the old man.	Ik die it foar de âld man.
And we did not.	En dat diene wy ​​net.
I can take care of them.	Ik kin foar har soargje.
Then they would stop.	Dan soene se ophâlde.
I had never met her.	Ik hie har noait moete.
This makes me go back and read this issue.	Dit makket my werom te gean en dit probleem te lêzen.
But, of course, he had to go.	Mar, fansels, hy moast gean.
Do what you can to make the other two stand out.	Doch wat jo kinne om de oare twa út te sjen.
Never seen one like it before.	Noch nea sa'n ien sjoen.
I said it's very likely that it's wrong.	Ik sei dat it heul wierskynlik is dat it ferkeard is.
You are probably the same.	Jo binne nei alle gedachten itselde.
He just had to think.	Hy moast mar tinke.
It looks like something's going on.	It liket as is der wat oan 'e hân.
I believe we should have done it.	Ik leau dat wy it dwaan moatten hawwe.
I went there last week.	Ik gie der ferline wike.
And for once, she was happy.	En foar ien kear wie se bliid.
Otherwise you should not have too many problems.	Oars moatte jo net te folle problemen hawwe.
But now we know why.	Mar no witte wy wêrom.
He never has and never will.	Hy hat nea en sil nea.
It happened a long time ago.	It barde lang lyn.
There are still people.	It binne noch minsken.
Take my picture before you go.	Nim myn foto foardat jo gean.
I just wanted to see.	Ik woe gewoan sjen.
His family would take care of him.	Syn famylje soe foar him soargje.
I looked out.	Ik seach út.
Be nice, pick them up and take them out.	Wês aardich, nim se op en nim se út.
This is to make things right.	Dit is om dingen goed te meitsjen.
He thought he was something.	Hy tocht dat er wat wie.
That was to tell her.	Dat wie har te fertellen.
She said he was happy for her.	Se sei dat er bliid foar har wie.
He's mad at me.	Hy is lilk op my.
There's a boy here who looks like you.	Der is hjir in jonge dy't op dy liket.
Here's what you will do.	Hjir is wat jo sille dwaan.
This is becoming a problem.	Dit wurdt in probleem.
She had heard it all before.	Se hie it allegear earder heard.
I did it three years ago.	Ik haw it trije jier lyn dien.
It's good work.	It is goed wurk.
Let us not worry now.	Lit ús no gjin soargen meitsje.
I have no idea how it works.	Ik haw gjin idee hoe't it wurket.
We tried everything a bit.	Wy hawwe alles in bytsje besocht.
You come through this.	Jo komme troch dit.
If so, fine.	As dat sa is, goed.
Or people who think they're your new friends.	Of minsken dy't tinke dat se jo nije freonen binne.
Not these people here.	Net dizze minsken hjir.
That was my job.	Dat wie myn wurk.
Whatever this was, it seemed real.	Wat dit ek wie, it like echt.
But they did not do it.	Mar se hawwe it net dien.
It would come to him.	It soe by him komme.
Everything would be better than this.	Alles soe better wêze as dit.
Not against.	Net op tsjin.
We would be seen.	Wy soene sjoen wurde.
She liked it here.	Se mocht hjir graach.
No one had done this to him before.	Nimmen hie him dit earder dien.
What he had heard before.	Wat er earder heard hie.
In a real book.	Yn in echt boek.
You can never tell.	Jo kinne nea fertelle.
I did not want to do it now.	Ik woe it no net dwaan.
Let it show a little.	Lit it in bytsje sjen litte.
Is at hand.	Is by de hân.
Please get help.	Graach help krije.
It was not to say how old he was.	It wie net te sizzen hoe âld hy wie.
I was not allowed to do this.	Ik mocht dit net dwaan.
They can not find their way.	Se kinne har wei net fine.
People talk about him, but he doesn't talk anymore.	Minsken prate oer him, mar hy praat net mear.
Do not say what happened.	Net sizze wat der bard is.
But he did not return.	Mar hy kaam net werom.
He'll just talk to me, for now.	Hy sil mar tsjin my prate, foar no.
He could not do much more now.	Hy koe no net folle mear dwaan.
There is not much to it.	Der is net folle oan.
I had to.	Ik moast wol.
We, you and me.	Wy, do en ik.
Neither said anything.	Gjin fan beide sei neat.
But it could not.	Mar it koe net.
Have you decided where you need to go this year?	Hawwe jo besletten wêr't jo dit jier hinne moatte?
I have decided not to drive.	Ik haw besletten net te riden.
That could be.	Dat soe wêze kinne.
You do not have to do anything.	Jo hoege neat te dwaan.
They do what people want.	Se dogge wat minsken wolle.
We did not really know what we were doing.	Wy wisten net echt wat wy diene.
Now it will never.	No sil it noait.
She is the mother of three children.	Se is mem fan trije bern.
I do not know who you are.	Ik wit net wa't jo binne.
First you will show him how to do it.	Earst sille jo him sjen litte hoe't it moat.
Best way to get there and back.	Bêste manier om dêr en werom te kommen.
And he goes through it again.	En hy giet der wer troch.
I have to keep this to the police.	Ik moat dizze foar de plysje hâlde.
Never, never would she see him again.	Nea, nea soe se him wer sjen.
And he did that to no one else.	En dat hat er oan gjinien oars dien.
Same with me.	Itselde mei my.
She looked at her friend.	Se seach har freon oan.
For the time being.	Foar no.
But it would not open to him.	Mar it soe net iepen foar him.
You are good too.	Jo binne ek goed.
Enter the room.	De keamer yn.
Once, she ran two days off from school.	Ien kear rûn se twa dagen fan skoalle ôf.
What are you trying to find.	Wat besykje jo te finen.
But maybe it's not as difficult as it seems.	Mar miskien is it net sa dreech as it liket.
I read it.	Ik haw it lêzen.
You have to work for it.	Jo moatte der foar wurkje.
He did not know what to say.	Hy wist net wat te sizzen.
Know that this is the time to give.	Wit dat dit de tiid is om te jaan.
And she could be so wrong.	En se koe sa ferkeard wêze.
Someone else was in the room.	Immen oars wie yn 'e keamer.
If that is the question.	As dat de fraach is.
He never was and never will be.	Hy wie noait en soe nea wêze.
I'll go there we'll go there.	Ik sil dêr gean wy dêr.
But she could wait.	Mar se koe wachtsje.
To know.	Witte.
But they should not be.	Mar se moatte net wêze.
Everyone has to leave.	Elkenien moat fuort.
I'll look after her.	Ik sil nei har sjen.
If you're late, you're late.	As jo ​​​​let binne, binne jo let.
This is very clear.	Dit is hiel dúdlik.
But that will not happen again.	Mar dat sil net wer barre.
You have to do what you have to.	Jo moatte dwaan wat jo moatte.
There is almost nothing to do.	Der is hast neat te dwaan.
I knew he was going to cause trouble.	Ik wist dat hy fan plan wie om problemen te meitsjen.
We do not know enough about what is happening.	Wy witte net genôch oer wat der bart.
That's what we do.	Dat dogge wy wol.
We are not children.	Wy binne gjin bern.
He knew so much to do.	Hy wist sa folle te dwaan.
I go back and talk to her.	Ik gean werom en praat mei har.
I told him it was completely out of the question.	Ik fertelde him dat it hielendal út 'e fraach wie.
Nobody goes anymore.	Nimmen giet mear.
She walked in on us.	Se rûn op ús yn.
See you tonight.	Sjoch dy fannacht.
They know that really, really well.	Dat witte se echt, echt goed.
Well is.	Wol is.
This is my favorite time of the year.	Dit is myn favorite tiid fan it jier.
All this dog wanted was his.	Alles wat dizze hûn woe, it wie syn.
I'm leaving.	Ik gean fuort.
She will never get tired.	Se sil nea wurch wurde.
We had some really good people out there.	Wy hiene in pear echt goede minsken út dêr.
And again and again and again.	En wer en wer en wer.
I felt that was the way to be me again.	Ik fielde dat dat de manier wie om my wer te wêzen.
It was not himself.	It wie net himsels.
It was over for him and he knew it.	It wie foar him oer en hy wist it.
Just as long as we are clear about this.	Krekt sa lang as wy binne dúdlik oer dit.
People just do not think about it.	Minsken tinke der gewoan net oer nei.
But it does not.	Mar it docht net.
I tried a few.	Ik besocht in pear.
Then one day he gets angry.	Dan wurdt er op in dei lilk.
I just wanted to let you know.	Ik woe it jo gewoan witte litte.
And there was one man.	En ien man wie.
What they maybe.	Wat se miskien.
Does as seen.	Doet as te sjen.
I'll do it.	Ik sil it dwaan.
This is said to be a bad thing.	Dit wurdt sein in min ding.
There was just no telling what the man could do.	Der wie gewoan net te sizzen wat de man dwaan koe.
Just as good.	Krekt sa goed.
At first it does not seem to be a problem at all.	Earst liket it hielendal gjin probleem te wêzen.
He was sure of that.	Dêr wie er wis fan.
This she can not do.	Dit kin se net dwaan.
She was not sure what she was looking at.	Se wie net wis wêr't se nei seach.
But that boy died and so did he.	Mar dy jonge kaam om en hy ek.
Has it seen me? 	Hat it my sjoen?
she asked.	frege se har ôf.
He put me here.	Hy sette my hjir.
You know they have to be there for you.	Jo witte dat se der foar jo moatte wêze.
My mother came here and stayed with a friend's family.	Myn mem kaam hjir en bleau by de famylje fan in freon.
Of course, you do not stop.	Fansels hâlde jo net op.
Hold on, friend.	Hâld der yn, freon.
Or thought you did.	Of tocht dat jo diene.
Well, he keeps it to himself, says the man.	Goed, hy hâldt it foar him, seit de man.
I just did not know.	Ik wist it gewoan net.
And it did not.	En it die net.
Let's ask her.	Litte wy har freegje.
I still could not say what the thing was.	Ik koe noch net sizze wat it ding wie.
It was not the first time, and it would not be the last.	It wie net de earste kear, en it soe net de lêste wêze.
We are not children anymore.	Wy binne gjin bern mear.
No one is here.	Gjinien hjir is.
It was our first time, but we'll be back.	It wie ús earste kear, mar wy komme werom.
I thought we agreed on that.	Ik tocht dat wy it der oer iens wiene.
How beautiful is the morning!	Hoe moai is de moarn!
This may have been a first.	Dit kin in earste west hawwe.
We have that.	Dat hawwe wy.
He is so beautiful.	Hy is sa moai.
She could believe it.	Se koe it leauwe.
See and show.	Sjoch en sjen litte.
He will never agree!	Hy sil nea iens!
She is always so happy.	Se is altyd sa bliid.
They have so many questions.	Se hawwe safolle fragen.
He actually did not ask him to do much.	Hy frege him eins net folle te dwaan.
The last time was about a week ago.	De lêste kear wie sa'n wike lyn.
I have something to tell you.	Ik haw dy wat te fertellen.
I want you ready for tomorrow.	Ik wol dy klear foar moarn.
Those are two questions.	Dat binne twa fragen.
They will eat it tomorrow.	Se sille it moarn ite.
Really, there's nothing to it.	Echt, der is neat oan it.
But let it be so.	Mar lit it sa wêze.
Everything just happened.	Alles barde gewoan.
I need them a lot.	Ik haw se in protte nedich.
His name is.	Syn namme is.
He can not let that happen.	Hy kin dat net barre litte.
I was so out of here.	Ik wie hjir sa út.
There was not much in it.	Dêr siet net folle yn.
A lot of work.	In protte wurk.
Not like that happens to everyone these days.	Net as dat bart mei elkenien dizze dagen.
Was it just that she wanted to know.	Wie it krekt dat se it witte woe.
It's not just about the money.	It giet net allinnich om it jild.
So is his food.	Sa is syn iten.
He did not have much to say.	Hy hie net folle te sizzen.
She looked at him.	Se seach him oan.
Has done me good.	Hat my goed dien.
He would like to know what happened to me.	Hy soe graach witte wat der mei my bard is.
It's just coming.	It komt gewoan.
But get this.	Mar krije dit.
We're going back to town.	Wy geane werom nei de stêd.
As friends.	As freonen.
We will stay and help.	Wy sille bliuwe en helpe.
When was it.	Wannear wie it.
She started to get angry.	Se begûn lilk te wurden.
Or what people believe of them.	Of wat minsken fan har leauwe.
Even though the work had absolutely nothing to say.	Ek al hie it wurk hielendal neat te sizzen.
I could see that happening.	Ik koe dat barre sjen.
What does he see now?	Wat sjocht er no?
Are you okay.	Giet it goed mei dy.
No one.	Net ien.
I did the same with her.	Ik die itselde mei har.
So we become real.	Sa wurde wy echt.
It looks like a meeting.	It liket in gearkomste.
I wish it had happened before we had kids.	Ik woe dat it bard wie foardat wy bern krigen.
He needed a friend.	Hy hie in freon nedich.
Well, it's not the only idea.	No, it is net it ienige idee.
It made me happy.	It makke my bliid.
I've never had a friend like you.	Ik haw noch noait in freon as dy hân.
But she does not speak either.	Mar se praat ek net.
It may or may never come.	It kin of kin nea komme.
For you, for me, for everyone here.	Foar jo, foar my, foar elkenien hjir.
It should not happen here.	It moat hjir net barre.
I felt pretty good about it.	Ik fielde my der aardich goed oer.
She tried to prepare for it.	Se besocht har der foar te meitsjen.
We were out.	Wy wiene út west.
But they were gone now.	Mar se wiene no fuort.
Not one of us knows where we are going.	Net ien fan ús wit wêr't wy hinne geane.
However, you do not have time to worry about it.	Hoe dan ek, jo hawwe gjin tiid om jo der soargen oer te meitsjen.
And they would show.	En se soene sjen litte.
I wish we had more.	Ik woe dat wy mear hawwe.
But it's going well with the two of us.	Mar it komt wol goed mei ús twa.
It could stay there forever.	It koe der wol foar altyd bliuwe.
It was obviously not one of us.	It wie fansels net ien fan ús.
It did not occur to him not to do it.	It kaam him net op om it net te dwaan.
Go and see.	Gean en sjoch.
They could handle it.	Se koene it oan.
It all took time.	Dit alles naam tiid.
That's all we ask.	Dat is alles wat wy freegje.
It is not the same as being.	It is net itselde as wêzen.
He can be both.	Hy kin beide wêze.
Maybe it will.	Miskien wol it wol.
It would seem that you still have to pay.	It soe lykje dat jo noch moatte betelje.
A friend came to the house.	In freon kaam by it hûs.
And she has it.	En se hat it.
More than enough.	Mear as genôch.
She has one if you need it.	Se hat ien as jo nedich.
Nobody told me that.	Nimmen fertelde my dat.
That's not you, you do not have to worry.	Dat is jo net, jo hoege jo gjin soargen te meitsjen.
He did not have to.	Hy hie net hoege.
Well, the time is now.	No, de tiid is no.
He could do nothing more about it, actually.	Hy koe der neat mear oan dwaan, eins.
I love everything.	Ik hâld alles yn.
That worked for me at the time.	Dat wurke foar my yn dy tiid.
But there is something else.	Mar der is wat oars.
It can not be beautiful.	It kin net moai wêze.
I'm going to get sick.	Ik sil siik wurde.
They met up at a party.	Se moete op in feest.
I do not ask her why.	Ik freegje har net wêrom.
And he has no regrets about that.	En dêr hat er gjin spyt fan.
She also doesn’t really act like one.	Se docht ek net echt as ien.
So it started.	Sa begûn it.
We do not have much time.	Wy hawwe net folle tiid.
Everyone comes here to find work.	Elkenien komt hjir om wurk te finen.
We can leave.	Wy kinne fuort.
I was ready for it.	Ik wie der klear foar.
And some other friends.	En wat oare freonen.
Almost no one goes to jail anymore.	Hast gjinien giet mear nei de finzenis.
Where it had to be.	Wêr't it wêze moast.
I thought about that a lot.	Dêr tocht ik in protte oer.
Hope you come back soon.	Hoopje dat jo gau werom komme.
It does not come in here.	It komt hjir net yn.
As in.	As in.
You did nothing to me.	Do hast my neat dien.
He never said what he intended to do.	Hy hat noait sein wat er fan plan wie te dwaan.
Keep it good.	Hâld it goed.
I assume they had a pretty good year.	Ik nim oan dat se in aardich goed jier hân hawwe.
If you have to.	As jo ​​moatte.
I want it bad.	Ik wol it min.
You met him at my house.	Jo moete him by myn hûs.
Maybe he could not.	Miskien koe er net.
I want to do something different.	Ik wol wat oars dwaan.
She did not seem to see me.	Se like my net te sjen.
Dad got a job.	Heit krige in baan.
You've been a friend.	Do hast in freon west.
We were so tired that we decided to go back.	Wy wiene wat wurch, dat wy besletten om werom te gean.
It does not matter which.	It makket neat út hokker.
He regretted that he could not make it himself.	Hy hie spyt dat er it sels net meitsje koe.
I need one.	Ik haw ien nedich.
He doesn't like me anymore either.	Hy liket my ek net mear.
It arrived.	It kaam oan.
And it was just, it was really hard.	En it wie gewoan, it wie echt dreech.
We do not think about it.	Wy tinke der net oer.
But it would not happen here.	Mar it soe hjir net barre.
The two agreed not to agree.	De twa wiene it iens om it net iens te wurden.
There is nothing for you to worry about.	D'r is neat foar jo om soargen te meitsjen.
There you have it.	Dêr hast it.
This name comes up.	Dizze namme komt op.
I just do not know what.	Ik wit gewoan net wat.
I knew it was coming, and it did.	Ik wist dat it kaam, en it die.
We just do them in the same room.	Wy dogge se gewoan yn deselde keamer.
Mother of you.	Mem fan dy.
I have no words.	Ik haw gjin wurden.
Talk to her.	Mei har prate.
So much.	Safolle.
Nothing much better to do.	Neat folle better te dwaan.
They need you more than you need them.	Se hawwe jo mear nedich as jo dit nedich binne.
That would not be accurate.	Dat soe net krekt wêze.
It's not pretty.	It is net moai.
Even if we do it right, we can not believe it at all.	Sels as wy it goed dogge, kinne wy ​​it net hielendal leauwe.
But now he had something he could do.	Mar no hie er wat dat er dwaan koe.
It all happened.	It is allegear bard.
Well, that's just not good enough for me.	No, dat is gewoan net goed genôch foar my.
He wanted a lot of things.	Hy woe in protte dingen.
She knew the car.	Se koe de auto.
We have to get there.	Wy moatte der hinne.
And she said now we need to talk.	En se sei no moatte wy prate.
And they do.	En dat dogge se.
I do not know what she will do.	Ik wit net wat se dwaan sil.
You can tell them here or not.	Jo kinne se hjir fertelle of net.
said the teacher.	sei de learaar.
People are not nice.	Minsken binne net aardich.
I wish you would take my kids and me.	Ik winskje dat jo myn bern en my nimme.
I knew her well enough.	Ik koe har goed genôch.
Let me know when you are ready.	Lit my witte as jo klear binne.
She has her parents to deal with.	Se hat har âlden om mei te dwaan.
But too often, they do not have much to say.	Mar te faak hawwe se net folle te sizzen.
You have a lot to give us.	Jo hawwe ús in protte te jaan.
And he.	En hy.
You will do well.	Jo sille it goed dwaan.
I do not know how to love a man.	Ik wit net hoe't ik fan in man hâlde moat.
But if it's not for you, that's fine too.	Mar as it net foar jo is, is dat ek goed.
I want to do something different myself.	Ik wol sels oars dwaan.
I hope you do too.	Ik hoopje dat jo it ek dogge.
But remember that you do.	Mar tink dat jo dogge.
Nea.	Nea.
He was still unsure of her.	Hy wie noch net wis fan har.
Of course, nothing goes according to plan.	Fansels giet neat nei plan.
I had to tell my dad.	Ik moast it myn heit fertelle.
It could again.	It koe wer.
No one will ever see her.	Nimmen sil se oait sjen.
Get in the car.	Gean yn de auto.
Saw it twice on the same day.	Seach it twa kear op deselde dei.
I do not know what's going on.	Ik wit net wat der bart.
He entered the house.	Hy kaam it hûs yn.
I still do not know what kind, or where.	Ik wit noch net hokker soarte, of wêr.
By mother her hand, from when she had been well.	Troch mem har hân, fan doe't se goed west hie.
It hit me hard, it hit me long hard.	It rekke my hurd, it rekke my lang hurd.
You need to talk to him.	Jo moatte mei him prate.
And the following.	En de folgjende.
Tell them they have no time to talk about it.	Fertel har dat se gjin tiid hawwe om der oer te praten.
I agree with keeping your name in it.	Ik bin it iens mei it hâlden fan jo namme yn.
It happened forever and one day.	It is foar altyd en in dei bard.
Neither of us said anything.	Net ien fan ús sei neat.
Now it is not so.	No is it net sa.
Carry on.	Troch gean.
Let's do this.	Litte wy dit dwaan.
But so it is.	Mar sa is it.
They will help us.	Se sille ús helpe.
This is now.	Dit die er no.
I remember you too.	Ik tink dy ek.
That was a few years ago.	Dat wie in pear jier lyn.
I have never done so hard in my life.	Ik haw noch noait sa dreech yn myn libben dien.
There she was expected.	Dêr waard se ferwachte.
He is very different now.	Hy is no hiel oars.
Then the problem seems different.	Dan liket it probleem oars.
I'll let you stay.	Ik lit dy bliuwe.
Everything we needed.	Alles wat wy nedich wiene.
She will not tell anyone.	Se sil it nimmen fertelle.
We are not such a place.	Wy binne net sa'n plak.
I do not know about you, boy.	Ik wit net oer dy, jonge.
It's totally sick.	It is hielendal siik.
He made that thing there.	Hy makke dat ding dêr.
It knew those things.	It wist dy dingen.
So good in me.	Sa goed yn my.
I had never seen him like this before.	Ik hie him noch noait sa sjoen.
They are waiting for him.	Se wachtsje op him.
I just think about one thing he told me.	Ik tink gewoan oer ien ding dat hy my fertelde.
But it's not too late.	Mar it is net te let.
Who knew you had so much.	Wa wist dat jo safolle hiene.
She does not look at him.	Se sjocht him net oan.
He is very kind to children.	Hy is heul aardich foar bern.
They would have done what they want.	Se soene dien hawwe wat se wolle.
That's just what it's.	Dat is net wat dit is.
I often talk to people about it.	Ik praat der faak mei minsken oer.
I hope she can get a job soon.	Ik hoopje dat se gau in baan krije kin.
You have to help me.	Jo moatte my helpe.
People can only do so much.	Minsken kinne allinnich mar safolle.
I have to go back, he thought.	Ik moat werom, tocht er.
But it does not work here.	Mar it wurket hjir net.
I'm here and you're there.	Ik bin hjir en do bist der.
I have that.	Ik haw dat.
It's just that.	It is gewoan dat.
Take a few years if you want.	Nim in pear jier as jo wolle.
Twice as many.	Twa kear safolle.
I felt him.	Ik fielde him.
I'm not sure.	Ik wis net.
She would never believe me.	Se soe my nea leauwe.
Let me ask you something.	Lit my dy wat freegje.
How nice to see him.	Wat moai om him te sjen.
She was eating with him.	Se wie mei him oan it iten.
It had to be that way.	It moast sa wêze.
I felt it had to be done.	Ik fielde dat it dien wurde moast.
We had no place to go.	Wy hiene gjin plak om te gean.
You'll be better than my friend here.	Jo sille better wêze as myn freon hjir.
I do not think we need their help.	Ik tink net dat wy har help nedich hawwe.
She would make him think what he wanted.	Se soe him tinke litte wat er woe.
Tomorrow you can leave here.	Moarn kinne jo hjir wei.
Whatever it was did not matter anymore.	Wat it ek wie makke net mear út.
His mother did.	Syn mem die dat wol.
Now there's a problem.	No is der in probleem.
She was sure.	Se wie wis.
Let them go then.	Lit se dan gean.
They waited, but no one came up.	Se wachtsje, mar gjinien kaam op.
It could not work.	It koe net wurkje.
She took his hand.	Se naam syn hân.
It's much better now.	It is no folle better.
We are ready for it.	Wy binne der klear foar.
He could not tell her, he could not show her.	Hy koe it har net fertelle, hy koe har it net sjen litte.
Please.	Asjebleaft.
Just wait for the time.	Gewoan wachtsje op 'e tiid.
You're wrong.	Do bist ferkeard.
They were only three.	Se wiene mar trije.
Now there is no time.	No is der gjin tiid.
I love my house.	Ik hâld fan myn hûs.
The door will be open.	De doar sil iepen wêze.
Much the same.	Folle itselde.
That was last month.	Dat wie ferline moanne.
It no longer has to be you or me.	It hoecht net mear do of ik te wêzen.
Will they be good?	Sille se goed wêze?
But here she is.	Mar hjir is se.
This was all true.	Dit wie allegear wier.
Back home yourself.	Werom thús sels.
He never did it when it did not come naturally.	Hy hat it noait dien as it net fansels kaam.
We only have today.	Wy hawwe allinnich hjoed.
Who knows what they will keep.	Wa wit wat se hâlde sille.
Of course she was done.	Fansels wie se dien.
Waiting for you.	Wachtsje op dy.
I can tell you it was some work.	Ik kin jo fertelle dat it wat wurk wie.
But there had been no one else in the car.	Mar der hie nimmen mear yn de auto west.
We are both too old and tired for that.	Dêr binne wy ​​beide te âld en wurch foar.
She loves you.	Se hâld fan dy.
Maybe no one knew.	Miskien wist net ien.
Take some time with you.	Nim der wat tiid mei.
If you are interested, let me know.	As jo ​​​​ynteressearre binne, lit it my witte.
We never go.	Wy geane noait.
Which makes me ask.	Wat makket my freegje.
We've never been here before.	Wy hawwe hjir noch nea west.
Nobody did that.	Nimmen die wat.
He probably just needed a friend, someone to talk to.	Hy hie wierskynlik gewoan in freon nedich, ien om mei te praten.
She looks really good.	Se sjocht der echt goed út.
It was what everyone thought.	It wie wat elkenien tocht.
I felt it before.	Ik fielde it earder.
They need to work.	Se moatte wurkje.
I want to get to the next one.	Ik wol op de folgjende komme.
Or he of her.	Of hy fan har.
Clearly, it has.	Dúdlik, it hat.
Please do not leave me alone.	Lit my asjebleaft net litte.
He saw how easy it was to make something out of nothing.	Hy seach hoe maklik it wie om wat fan neat te meitsjen.
But they work.	Mar se wurkje.
We're in place.	Wy binne op it plak.
They show my mom me.	Se litte myn mem my sjen.
It's so good it can not be real.	It is sa goed dat it net echt kin wêze.
I will do whatever it takes to have that.	Ik sil dwaan wat it nedich is om dat te hawwen.
That is, if you want to take it.	Dat is, as jo it nimme wolle.
It gets better and better with time.	It wurdt better en better mei de tiid.
Children have many friends.	Bern hawwe in protte freonen.
He does nothing about it.	Dêr docht er neat fan.
You do not have me.	Jo hawwe my net.
I could no longer agree with him.	Ik koe it net mear mei him iens wêze.
I can not wait to read that book.	Ik kin net wachtsje om dat boek te lêzen.
But something was not right.	Mar wat wie net goed.
So much for being on things.	Safolle om op dingen te wêzen.
I still believe that was wrong.	Ik leau noch dat dat ferkeard wie.
She hopes she was.	Se hope dat se wie.
It’s about how good things can be.	It giet oer hoe goed dingen kinne wêze.
It's just plain.	It is gewoan gewoan.
I think it's the right thing to do.	Ik tink dat it it goede ding is om te dwaan.
A few pick me up.	In pear nimme my op.
Not necessary.	Net nedich.
Try a few.	Besykje in pear.
He was not sure what, if anything, to say to the man.	Hy wie net wis wat, as der wat, tsjin de man te sizzen.
But he did not hear her.	Mar hy hearde har net.
They will give you what you want.	Se sille jo jaan wat jo wolle.
But one person in the house would do that.	Mar ien persoan yn 'e hûs soe dat dwaan.
A woman this time.	In frou dizze kear.
I heard nothing of him say.	Ik hearde neat fan er sei.
No question about it.	Gjin fraach oer it.
In that city.	Yn dy stêd.
I would love to have one.	Ik soe graach ien hawwe.
That can be a problem.	Dat kin in probleem wêze.
He seems to be reading my mind.	Hy liket myn gedachten te lêzen.
Please just see me.	Sjoch my asjebleaft gewoan.
That's just that.	Dat is krekt dat.
We love that it does not.	Wy hâlde dat it net docht.
It's in me.	It is yn my.
These days, it's easy to figure out.	Dizze dagen is it maklik om út te finen.
But she was not worried.	Mar se wie gjin soargen.
I need that.	Ik ha dat nedich.
That year.	Dat jier.
He turned himself around.	Hy die himsels om.
We are not who you are.	Wy binne net sa as jo binne.
It will not happen.	It sil net barre.
The problem is that it does not work.	It probleem is dat it net wurket.
Come here.	Kom hjir hinne.
You can be who you can be.	Jo kinne wêze wa't jo wêze kinne.
One thing she could do something with.	Ien ding koe se wat mei.
We love you and are here for you.	Wy hâlde fan dy en binne hjir foar dy.
I'm not sure how he did that.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe't er dat die.
He wanted something more, he wanted something else.	Hy woe wat mear, hy woe wat oars.
I think he just did not know what to do.	Ik tink dat hy gewoan net wist wat te dwaan.
He thought it was good.	Hy fûn dat it goed wie.
This is not entirely accurate.	Dit is net hielendal krekt.
You're not doing so well today.	Jo dogge it hjoed net sa goed.
Never seen such a thing before.	Noch noait sa'n ding earder sjoen.
You know that can not happen.	Jo witte dat dat net kin.
He looked at himself.	Hy seach nei himsels.
And here she is.	En hjir is se.
I still had two people left.	Ik hie noch twa minsken oer.
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.	As jo ​​​​fragen hawwe, freegje jo dan frij.
You're in my house.	Do bist yn myn hûs.
No one took money with them anymore.	Nimmen naam jild mear mei.
I just thought the man was talking for too long.	Ik tocht krekt dat de man te lang praat.
I'm ready to take whatever's to come.	Ik bin ree om te nimmen wat der komt.
Not even? 	Net iens?
asked my father.	frege myn heit.
She said not a word.	Se sei gjin wurd.
He became a father.	Hy waard heit.
He would be too much in the open.	Hy soe te folle yn 'e iepen wêze.
Now we will.	No sille wy.
She had to think of something to do.	Se moast tinke wat te dwaan.
I wonder if she came home to see me.	Ik freegje my ôf oft se fan hûs kommen is om my te sjen.
He could take them one by one.	Hy koe se ien foar ien nimme.
It was not ready.	It wie net klear.
I have no one to help me.	Ik haw gjinien om my te helpen.
We say, look what happened.	Wy sizze, sjoch wat der bard is.
She could not do much.	Se koe net folle dwaan.
I should be fine.	Ik soe goed wêze moatte.
Only this.	Allinnich dit.
We just need more of us.	Wy hawwe gewoan mear fan ús nedich.
It was just to eat together.	It wie gewoan om tegearre te iten.
I can handle that.	Dêr kin ik wol mei.
She wondered what had happened to her.	Se frege har ôf wat der mei bard wie.
How is your family? 	Hoe sit it mei dyn famylje?
he asked.	hy frege.
In fact, no one does.	Eins, meitsje dat gjinien.
This is the house that stands today.	Dit is it hûs dat hjoed stiet.
You just watch and wait.	Jo gewoan sjen en wachtsje.
Do not worry, everything is fine.	Sit gjin soargen, alles is goed.
Look around the room.	Sjoch om 'e keamer.
She knew it, even though he did not.	Se wist it, ek al die er net.
She never talked about it.	Se hat der noait oer praat.
She has the day off.	Se hat de dei frij.
You will do.	Jo sille dwaan.
Tell me what happened.	Fertel my wat der bard is.
We talked about it a bit.	Wy hawwe it der in bytsje oer hân.
But here's the problem.	Mar hjir is it probleem.
Everyone was scared.	Elkenien wie bang.
This was no different.	Dit wie net oars.
I try really hard.	Ik besykje echt hurd.
He lived there for a few years.	Hy hat dêr in pear jier wenne.
But there was none.	Mar der wie gjinien.
That made him think twice about a woman.	Dat liet him twa kear tinke oer in frou.
It was hard to get through the city.	It wie dreech om troch de stêd te kommen.
He is here with us in this room.	Hy is hjir by ús yn dizze keamer.
They do not like me.	Se hâlde net fan my.
But the man did not hear.	Mar de man hearde net.
This is a long time ago.	Dit is no lang lyn.
Did me no good.	Hat my neat goed dien.
He wanted to go home.	Hy woe werom nei hûs.
She had seen it happen before.	Se hie it earder barre sjoen.
But the old man never heard him.	Mar de âld man hat him nea heard.
He started to worry me.	Hy begûn my soargen te meitsjen.
A dog could eat a mother.	In hûn koe in mem ite.
They probably still live there.	Se wenje dêr nei alle gedachten noch.
They are no longer here.	Se binne hjir net mear.
He knows there is something wrong.	Hy wit dat der wat net goed is.
I never did it to hurt anyone.	Ik haw it noait dien om immen sear te meitsjen.
We know how that is.	Wy witte hoe't dat is.
I came back to talk to her about it.	Ik kaam werom om dêr mei har oer te praten.
His father, so long ago.	Syn heit, sa lang lyn.
That you will do what is good for you.	Dat jo sille dwaan wat goed is foar jo.
The boy told his mother about his day.	De jonge fertelde syn mem oer syn dei.
I wanted to do it better.	Ik woe it better dwaan.
I can not say why.	Ik kin net sizze wêrom.
That's where it's.	Dat is wêr't it is.
The girl is very beautiful.	It famke is hiel moai.
We have not asked about these issues.	Wy hawwe net frege om dizze problemen.
He just wants to work.	Hy wol gewoan wurkje.
This time he would find her.	Dizze kear soe hy har fine.
We'll look into it.	Wy sille der nei sjen.
I do this at home.	Ik doch dit thús.
Maybe we never did.	Miskien hawwe wy it noait dien.
He loves school.	Hy hâldt fan skoalle.
He was not just talking.	Hy wie net allinnich oan it praten.
You can always get a nice three.	Jo kinne altyd moai in trije krije.
They have to be very careful with what they say.	Se moatte tige foarsichtich wêze mei wat se sizze.
I can not believe this.	Ik kin dit net leauwe.
Of course there is work too.	Der is fansels ek wurk.
Otherwise you're in trouble.	Oars bist yn de problemen.
Well, maybe first.	No, miskien earst.
You should do that if you can.	Jo moatte dat dwaan as jo kinne.
Maybe he did not really want to know.	Miskien woe er it eins net witte.
That is a question.	Dat is in fraach.
We found each other.	Wy hawwe elkoar fûn.
That was my life.	Dat wie myn libben.
I think you will like it there.	Ik tink dat jo it dêr leuk fine.
We should have done better.	Wy hiene it better moatten dwaan.
It's not a good movie.	It is gjin goede film.
This is not a place to do that.	Dit is gjin plak om dat te dwaan.
Sure, he was tired.	Wis, hy wie wurch.
All you have to do is wait.	Alles wat jo hoege te dwaan is wachtsje.
She had no reason to be surprised.	Se hie gjin reden om ferrast te wurden.
I could not work.	Ik koe net wurkje.
It should not be so.	It moat net sa.
I had never thought of that before.	Ik hie der noch noait sa oan tocht.
She was actually expecting a man.	Se hie eins in man ferwachte.
That is no longer money for everyone.	Dat is net mear jild foar elkenien.
In the letter.	Yn de brief.
He needed a plan to do this.	Hy hie in plan nedich om dit te dwaan.
He knows me now.	Hy ken my no.
It was up to me.	It wie oan my.
I'm pretty happy.	Ik bin aardich bliid.
I love reading.	Ik hâld fan lêzen.
We could not do this anymore.	Wy koene dit net mear.
It was some kind of party or something.	It wie in soarte fan feest of sa.
So money worked.	Sa wurke jild.
Afraid he had almost hurt her.	Bang dat er har hast sear dien hie.
But that was not true.	Mar dat wie net wier.
Just like anything you want.	Krekt as alles wat jo wolle.
Food is bad here.	Iten is hjir min.
Somehow.	Op ien of oare manier.
And so it worked.	En sa wurke it.
They had nothing to say.	Se hiene gjin dingen te sizzen.
And believe me, it was not fun.	En leau my, it wie net leuk.
That was more than a week ago.	Dat wie mear as in wike lyn.
I do not think she cares about what we think.	Ik tink net dat se it makket oer wat wy tinke.
Mom, open this door.	Mem, doch dizze doar iepen.
I think there's one thing.	Ik tink dat der ien ding is.
Go away, boy.	Gean fuort, jonge.
There you are.	Dêr bist.
He looked around.	Hy seach om him hinne.
If it's just money you need.	As it gewoan jild is dat jo nedich binne.
Of course they want to win.	Fansels wolle se winne.
It was just kind of.	It wie gewoan in soarte fan.
Something happened to me that day.	Der barde my dy dei wat.
I have no idea where we are.	Ik ha gjin idee wêr't wy binne.
But there are not enough of us.	Mar der binne net genôch fan ús.
I have to go soon.	Ik moat gau gean.
The people remain.	De minsken bliuwe.
Do you have any questions?	Hawwe jo fragen?
A very nice girl.	In hiel aardich famke.
He would have.	Hy hie wol.
There are people who love us and take care of us.	D'r binne minsken dy't fan ús hâlde en foar ús soargje.
We're still having a baby.	Wy krije noch in bern.
It seemed so real.	It like sa echt.
She would not have let me have it.	Se soe my it net hawwe litte.
He just.	Hy gewoan.
And then you are there.	En dan binne jo dêr.
No one else could know it.	Nimmen oars koe it witte.
They also would not have to be long.	Se soene ek net hoege te wêzen lang.
I have a little more than a month to go.	Ik haw in bytsje mear as in moanne te gean.
It was such a big letter.	It wie sa'n grutte brief.
I needed some time to get away.	Ik hie in bytsje tiid nedich om fuort te kommen.
Let it come.	Lit it komme.
But she had to know it somehow.	Mar se moast it op ien of oare manier witte.
She is a good wife and a good mother.	Se is in goede frou en in goede mem.
I just did not like it.	Ik fûn it gewoan net leuk.
But he's still going.	Mar hy giet noch.
She's ready.	Se is klear.
There was no me anymore.	Der wie gjin my mear.
Ite.	Ite.
It might as well have.	It soe wol hawwe kinne.
She lives in the city.	Se wennet yn 'e stêd.
Must wake up early for work.	Moatte betiid wekker wurde foar wurk.
I had expected so much.	Ik hie safolle ferwachte.
She could wait.	Se koe wachtsje.
You may be interested in.	Jo kinne wêze ynteressearre yn.
She got it wrong.	Se hat it ferkeard.
Look in there, no one there, nothing there.	Sjoch der yn, gjinien dêr, neat dêr.
They were true.	Se wiene wier.
I wish you everything.	Ik winskje dy alles.
He wanted to make it himself.	Hy woe it sels meitsje.
And see where it has them.	En sjoch wêr't it se hat.
I know things.	Ik wit dingen.
I do not hold such money at hand.	Ik hâld sa'n jild net by de hân.
I bought a new car today.	Ik haw hjoed in nije auto kocht.
How did he get this job?	Hoe krige hy dizze baan?
They have done great things.	Se hawwe grutte dingen dien.
You really like this and want more.	Jo hâld fan dit echt en wolle mear.
That opportunity had come.	Dy kâns wie kommen.
We're leaving in an hour.	Wy geane oer in oere fuort.
But they want to be careful.	Mar se wolle foarsichtich wêze.
Glad you have both.	Bliid dat jo beide hawwe.
But she had been more than that.	Mar se hie mear west as dat.
He knew it better than he himself knew.	Hy wist it better as hy sels wist.
And you want what he wants.	En jo wolle wat hy wol.
I had food.	Ik hie iten.
He knows it.	Hy wit it.
But they could not be found.	Mar se koene net fûn wurde.
I have eaten them enough.	Ik haw se genôch iten.
I had to get out of there.	Ik moast der út.
She gave me life.	Se joech my it libben.
We have to.	Wy moatte.
I'll find the money.	Ik sil it jild fine.
Do not know him.	Ken him net.
I have to tell you, they are not that good.	Ik moat dy sizze, se binne net sa goed.
That hurt too.	Dat die ek sear.
For some reason it does not work.	Om ien of oare reden wurket it net.
Without water, no life.	Sûnder wetter, gjin libben.
It was still alive.	It wie noch yn libben.
In fact, that was not true.	Eins wie dat net wier.
Everything we say or do is wrong.	Alles wat wy sizze of dogge is ferkeard.
I thought it would be a good idea to tell a friend.	Ik tocht dat it in goed idee wêze soe om in freon te fertellen.
You get nothing like that.	Jo krije neat as dat.
Come here and let me look at you.	Kom hjir en lit my nei dy sjen.
They should be.	Se soene wêze moatte.
There's more where that came from, always.	Der is mear wêr't dat wei kaam, altyd.
There's no better person to get it from than me.	D'r is gjin bettere persoan om it fan te krijen as ik.
That could not happen anymore.	Dat koe net mear.
I'm fine tonight.	Ik kom fannacht goed.
It was two other people.	It wiene twa oare minsken.
Everyone knows her there.	Elkenien ken har dêr.
She knows she's not the only one.	Se wit dat se net de ienige is.
Her work did not seem to be enough.	Har wurk like net genôch te wêzen.
He used to have it when he was a kid.	Hy hie it eartiids doe't er in bern wie.
But that does not matter.	Mar dat makket neat út.
How long can you go without water?	Hoe lang kinne jo gean sûnder wetter?
Mom these days.	Mem dizze dagen.
I thought so too.	Dat tocht ik ek.
You do not need this.	Jo hawwe dit net nedich.
Did not need it.	Hie it net nedich.
This is now done.	Dit is no dien.
Everyone went on with their lives.	Elkenien gie troch mei har libben.
It seemed too easy.	It like te maklik.
She came to see me today.	Se kaam my hjoed te sjen.
He never told the truth.	Hy hat nea de wierheid ferteld.
She was sure of that.	Dêr wie se wis fan.
But you will go in there.	Mar jo sille der yn gean.
We think we do.	Wy tinke dat wy dogge.
I really like my bed.	Ik hâld echt fan myn bêd.
It became my new car, and it could for you too.	It waard myn nije auto, en it koe ek foar jo.
Nobody really knows much about it.	Nimmen wit der eins folle oer.
There he is.	Dêr is er.
I wish the whole movie would be like that.	Ik woe dat de hiele film sa wêze soe.
How much time did they still have.	Hoefolle tiid hiene se noch.
Give her no thing, no thing.	Jou har gjin ding, gjin ding.
Well, that does not concern me.	No, dat giet my net oan.
He lives with his father.	Hy wennet by syn heit.
A sick thing.	In siik ding.
It just went to show.	It gie gewoan te sjen.
You're a father.	Do bist in heit.
Life was never the same.	It libben wie nea itselde.
He could not work.	Hy koe net wurkje.
This was her thing of course.	Dit wie har ding fansels.
He met her.	Hy moete har.
I wish there was a way to be sure.	Ik winskje dat der in manier wie om wis te wêzen.
This worked quite well.	Dit wurke hielendal goed.
And parents want to come.	En âlden wolle komme.
You take us back.	Jo nimme ús werom.
In fact, it can already happen.	Eins kin dit al bart.
When the time comes, of course.	As de tiid komt, fansels.
He had to tell her.	Hy moast it har fertelle.
Work on the children.	Wurkje oan de bern.
And even then.	En sels dan.
I did a good job, too.	Ik die goed wurk, te.
And, sure enough, they did.	En, wis genôch, se diene.
But, there is something to look forward to.	Mar, der is wat om nei út te sjen.
The mother knew the time was coming.	De mem wist dat de tiid kaam.
She says it's for the best.	Se seit dat it foar it bêste is.
But he could find her again.	Mar hy koe har wer fine.
She had a name.	Se hie in namme.
I looked around.	Ik seach om my hinne.
But, he said, there was more.	Mar, sei er, der wie mear.
They knew something different in life.	Se koene wat oars yn it libben.
And something happens.	En der bart wat.
But it does not.	Mar it docht net.
Nothing is in place until everything is in place.	Neat is yn plak oant alles is yn plak.
Somehow they no longer seem real.	Op ien of oare manier lykje se net mear echt.
But this does not have to be the case.	Mar dit hoecht net sa te wêzen.
Tomorrow is the big day.	Moarn is de grutte dei.
That's what this place is really for.	Dat is wêr't dit plak echt foar is.
There are a few other things needed.	Der binne in pear oare dingen nedich.
I was late for school.	Ik wie te let op skoalle.
They were open.	Se wiene iepen.
No problems, no problems, no worries.	Gjin problemen, gjin problemen, gjin soargen.
I know what the truth is.	Ik wit wat de wierheid is.
We have some questions.	Wy hawwe wat fragen.
It should stop here.	It moat hjir ophâlde.
Well, that was not difficult.	No, dat wie net dreech.
You have to do both.	Jo moatte beide dwaan.
He too, of course.	Hy ek, fansels.
There were some problems.	Der wie wat problemen.
You just have to get used to it.	Jo moatte der mar oan wenne.
That was her too.	Dat wie har ek.
But it did not either.	Mar it die ek net.
And the man was gone.	En de man wie fuort.
Everything else has to go.	Al it oare moat gean.
And not just here.	En net allinnich hjir.
He just did not like me.	Hy like my net goed.
She wanted it.	Se woe dit.
There was no question who it could be.	Der wie gjin fraach wa't it wêze koe.
She was still looking at him.	Se seach noch nei him.
She gets over it, or not.	Se komt der wol oer, of net.
No one talks to each other anymore.	Nimmen prate mear mei elkoar.
It always hurts.	It docht altyd sear.
It felt really good.	It fielde echt goed.
Today it is different.	Hjoed is it oars.
That was probably what I was doing.	Dat wie ik dan ek wierskynlik.
But it does not get better.	Mar it wurdt net better.
My wife always tells me not to keep it there.	Myn frou seit my altyd dat ik it dêr net hâlde moat.
Just no way, no way.	Gewoan gjin manier, gjin manier.
I think three kids is enough.	Ik tink dat trije bern genôch binne.
It works well.	Dit die goed wurk.
I'm glad you came.	Ik bin bliid dat jo kommen binne.
I have some idea.	Ik haw wat idee.
What we will have.	Wat wy sille hawwe.
How can you not love her ?.	Hoe kinne jo net fan har hâlde?.
They do a lot of hard work.	Se dogge in protte hurd wurk.
They will never.	Se sille nea.
There was his chance.	Dêr wie syn kâns.
There is nothing to come.	Der is neat te kommen.
He had done his job well.	Hy hie syn wurk goed dien.
We are here for one thing.	Wy binne hjir foar ien ding.
She had no house, no family, no people.	Se hie gjin hûs, gjin famylje, gjin minsken.
Help a guy out.	Help in keardel út.
He looked at his hand again.	Hy seach wer nei syn hân.
I made good money.	Ik makke goed jild.
If you have not already done so, you do not need to.	As jo ​​dat net diene, moatte jo noch net.
Things around the city.	Dingen om 'e stêd.
They make our house a home.	Se meitsje ús hûs in thús.
You have to help them.	Jo moatte har helpe.
There is only one problem.	Der is mar ien probleem.
But there can be no going back.	Mar der kin gjin wei werom.
Do nothing, a few days.	Doch neat, in pear dagen.
This did not look too good.	Dit seach der net al te goed út.
He's this big guy and a good guy.	Hy is dizze grutte en in goede keardel.
We have no children.	Wy hawwe gjin bern.
I love everyone at home.	Ik hâld fan elkenien thús.
I love reading.	Ik hâld fan lêzen.
He had done nothing to be afraid of.	Hy hie neat dien om bang foar te wêzen.
I thought nothing of it.	Ik tocht der neat fan.
I have a job for you.	Ik haw in baan foar dy.
Do you want to come with me?	Wolle jo mei my komme?
Can't think of that now.	Kin dêr no net oan tinke.
They hurt you.	Se hawwe sear dy.
She goes with.	Se giet mei.
He had nothing to say.	Hy hie neat te sizzen.
But it's something.	Mar it is wat.
And do it.	En docht it.
Where should we go today?	Wêr moatte wy hjoed hinne?
But it was still pretty good.	Mar it wie noch aardich goed.
Dog would know.	Hûn soe witte.
We can handle that.	Dat kinne wy ​​wol oan.
But she did it better.	Mar se die it better.
There is just this.	Der is krekt dit.
Nobody likes to be told what to do.	Nimmen hâldt fan ferteld wurde wat te dwaan.
But we are what we are.	Mar wy binne wat wy binne.
I think it was.	Ik tink dat it wie.
Nothing at all.	Neat.
He's my best friend.	Hy is myn bêste freon.
You want to do it again and again.	Jo wolle it wer en wer dwaan.
That we are very surprised and, of course, very happy.	Dat wy binne tige ferrast en, fansels, tige bliid.
And don’t even ask what exactly is going to happen.	En sels net freegje wat der krekt barre sil.
Be right back.	Sa werom.
Like a normal girl.	As in gewoan famke.
But you know what people say.	Mar jo witte wat minsken sizze.
That it is wrong.	Dat it ferkeard is.
These people want nothing from him.	Dizze minsken wolle neat fan him.
It all happened by itself.	It barde allegear fan himsels.
Let me know how much you need.	Lit my witte hoefolle jo nedich hawwe.
He was ready for the day.	Hy wie klear foar de dei.
This city was a real place.	Dizze stêd wie in echt plak.
Just one year ago.	Krekt ien jier lyn.
People still want to do something.	Minsken wolle noch wol wat dwaan.
You can not do much better than that.	Jo kinne net folle better as dat.
In you go.	Yn jo gean.
She has not looked back since.	Se hat sûnt net werom sjoen.
He's been there before.	Hy hat der al earder west.
Or until they had no water.	Of oant se gjin wetter hiene.
Now and then and now, what is really going on here.	No en no en no, wat is hjir eins.
It was too late for me.	It wie my te let.
Or you may be angry at your father.	Of jo binne miskien lilk op jo heit.
And song.	En liet.
Wis.	Wis.
It was hard work.	It wie hurd wurk.
She had it.	Se hie it.
There may be more to it than that.	D'r kin mear oan wêze as dat.
A few.	In pear.
Wrong wrong wrong.	Ferkeard ferkeard ferkeard.
He looked surprised.	Hy seach ferrast.
Really, they were just kids.	Echt, se wiene mar bern.
Everyone needs a car today!	Elkenien hat hjoed in auto nedich!
Whatever, they're gone.	Wat dan ek, se binne fuort.
And so far so good.	En oant no ta giet it goed.
They have had their time.	Se hawwe har tiid hân.
Nobody asked us to do it.	Nimmen frege ús om it te dwaan.
It's just a question of when.	It is mar in fraach fan wannear.
As if he did not want to say.	As woe er net sizze.
He wants to be here in his house with his mother.	Hy wol hjir yn syn hûs mei syn mem wêze.
I already knew that.	Dat wist ik ek al.
He told us everything he had done.	Hy fertelde ús alles wat er dien hie.
But there is so little we can do.	Mar d'r is sa'n bytsje neat dat wy kinne dwaan.
But not now, not so.	Mar net no, net sa.
But that was never his way.	Mar dat wie nea syn manier.
Now this man is one of my best friends.	No is dizze man ien fan myn bêste freonen.
Or, you know, really early.	Of, jo witte, echt betiid.
I was totally sick.	Ik wie hielendal siik.
We could not find a place.	Wy koene gjin plak fine.
You have to believe me about that.	Dêr moatte jo my oer leauwe.
Not alone yet.	Noch net allinnich.
Think, if you can.	Tink, as jo kinne.
But you have since.	Mar jo hawwe sûnt dy tiid.
Please do not do this.	Doch dit asjebleaft net.
Be careful with it.	Wês der foarsichtich mei.
I do not see him.	Ik sjoch him net.
I love people over.	Ik hâld fan minsken oer.
Many people are afraid of it.	In protte minsken binne der bang foar.
A few hours from now.	In pear oeren fan no ôf.
We do not agree.	Wy binne it net iens.
It was the thing to do.	It wie it ding om te dwaan.
He would wait.	Hy soe wachtsje.
Will want to go.	Sil wol gean.
He gets up early every day.	Hy stiet alle dagen betiid op.
Of course you know better than that.	Fansels witte jo better as dat.
For one, you get things done.	Foar ien krije jo dingen dien.
We're going to the movie.	Wy geane nei de film.
Your wife is gone.	Dyn frou is fuort.
Maybe he was just sick of me.	Miskien wie er gewoan siik fan my.
The food is so good.	It iten is sa goed.
That can not be!	Dat kin net!
People had done that too.	Minsken hiene dat ek dien.
I can see what you're doing.	Ik kin sjen wat jo dogge.
Why do not you come?	Wêrom komme jo net?
They say it came in handy.	Se sizze dat it goed kaam.
We are not ready for that yet.	Dêr binne wy ​​noch net klear foar.
I'm sorry about everything.	It spyt my fan alles.
That will not help.	Dat sil net helpe.
They are not even bad.	Se binne net iens min.
This was really much too easy.	Dit wie echt folle te maklik.
Many more were sick.	Folle mear wiene siik.
I have to tell her.	Ik moat it har fertelle.
I actually think he expected it.	Ik tink eins dat hy it ferwachte.
It did not matter to me.	It makke my neat út.
That's hard work.	Dat is hurd wurk.
For some reason, she looked different to me.	Om ien of oare reden seach se my oars út.
It's not that easy.	It is net sa maklik.
We can not stay here.	Wy kinne hjir net bliuwe.
For some reason, that seemed like hours ago.	Om ien of oare reden like dat oeren lyn.
I hope she loves that child as much as her first.	Ik hoopje dat se fan dat bern like folle hâlde as har earste.
Everyone was scared, but you.	Elkenien waard bang, mar jo.
You've never seen me.	Do hast my nea sjoen.
That was totally wrong.	Dat wie hielendal ferkeard.
Many believe him.	In protte leauwe him.
This was not his room anymore.	Dit wie syn keamer net mear.
He used to have no time, but now he does.	Earder hie er gjin tiid, mar no wol.
There are still waiting.	Dêr wachtsje noch op.
It was better that you never met.	It wie better dat jo noait moete hawwe.
With everyone it is different.	Mei elkenien is it oars.
This was so easy to make.	Dit wie sa maklik te meitsjen.
You will also grow old.	Jo sille ek âld wurde.
See what we can come up with.	Sjoch wat wy kinne komme mei.
The same thing happened to me.	Itselde barde my.
I think it's true.	Ik tink dat it wier is.
Not that you would know it to look after him.	Net dat jo it witte soene om nei him te sjen.
Well, nothing, really.	No, neat, echt.
You will be seen.	Jo wurde sjoen.
It's not something to be afraid of.	It is net wat om bang foar te wêzen.
They eat it.	Se ite it.
I would also buy a book from him.	Ik soe ek in boek fan him keapje.
I'll be visiting the house tomorrow.	Ik sil moarn it hûs besykje.
But often things are not what they seem to be.	Mar faak binne dingen net wat se lykje te wêzen.
You would never know it by looking at us.	Jo soene it noait witte troch nei ús te sjen.
That he could see.	Dat koe er sjen.
How he died.	Hoe't er stoar.
There was another man.	Dêr wie in oare man.
I saw you talking to that man.	Ik seach dy mei dy man prate.
I need to talk to you.	Ik moat mei dy prate.
And it hurts us.	En it docht ús sear.
But she came up with nothing.	Mar se kaam mei neat.
It was nothing, really.	It wie neat, echt.
I had nothing to do with it.	Ik hie der neat om.
It does not matter here.	It makket hjir neat út.
Tell no one what's really going on.	Fertel gjinien wat der echt bart.
He does this to everyone.	Hy docht dit oan elkenien.
Works for me !.	Wurket foar my!.
But there is something else.	Mar dêr is wat oars.
But there was no other way.	Mar der wie gjin oare manier.
Nice to say.	Moai om te sizzen.
He was not happy, but he said nothing.	Hy wie net bliid, mar hy sei neat.
It also hit home.	It rekke ek thús.
So they knew about it.	Sa wisten se der fan.
All we have to do is say the word.	Alles wat wy hoege te dwaan is it wurd te sizzen.
I know what I'm seeing.	Ik wit wat ik sjoch.
Not everyone does that.	Net elkenien docht dat.
We have to think.	Wy moatte tinke.
He looked angry.	Hy seach lilk út.
What would you like to see?	Wat soene jo graach sjen wolle?
She was not angry.	Se wie net lilk.
You do.	Dat dogge jo.
It makes him who he is.	It makket him wa't hy is.
She met her new friend.	Se moete har nije freon.
Now you're a man.	No bist in man.
The young woman is alone again.	De jonge frou is wer allinnich.
You are expected to stay.	Jo wurde ferwachte om te bliuwen.
I just love it so much.	Ik hâld der gewoan sa folle fan.
Let me just do the talking.	Lit my mar it praten dwaan.
Living with her mother.	Wenne mei har mem.
But the other thing then.	Mar it oare ding dan.
I just want to see.	Ik wol gewoan sjen.
It felt no more than her.	It fielde net mear as har.
They need you when they need you.	Se hawwe jo nedich as se jo nedich binne.
So far, that has worked for me.	Oant no ta hat dat wurke foar my.
I'm a person.	Ik bin in persoan.
Do not wish for more and more.	Net winskje foar mear en mear.
Before you even have to ask.	Foardat jo sels moatte freegje om.
He would think about that word another time.	Hy soe in oare kear oer dat wurd tinke.
People might need to think a little more.	Minsken moatte miskien wat mear tinke.
He even told me to look out for her.	Hy fertelde my sels om foar har út te sjen.
I believe all our lives will be much better.	Ik leau dat al ús libben folle better sil wêze.
Let him eat them.	Lit him se ite.
Nothing seems to be coming up.	Der liket neat op te kommen.
He had something to say here.	Hy hie hjir wat foar te sizzen.
They must be one and the same.	Se moatte ien en itselde wêze.
Did we eat it all?	Hawwe wy it allegear iten?
Make it work.	Meitsje it wurk.
It was beautiful here.	It wie hjir moai.
I'm still there.	Ik bin der noch by.
Problem is, they never are.	Probleem is, se binne noait.
Now he knew what it was.	No wist er wat it wie.
That they would know.	Dat soene se witte.
If there were.	As der wiene.
But we have to work too hard now.	Mar wy moatte no te hurd wurkje.
I will know it now.	Ik sil it no witte.
It was my favorite.	It wie myn favorite.
She goes through a lot of things.	Se giet troch in protte dingen.
As sure there was one.	As wis wie der ien.
And good driving.	En goed riden.
I think they tried that.	Ik tink dat se dat besocht hawwe.
His family was with him.	Syn famylje wie by him.
It made my day that time.	It makke myn dei dy tiid.
I work every day.	Ik wurkje alle dagen.
Let's just talk.	Lit ús mar prate.
You probably have one too.	Jo hawwe wierskynlik ek ien.
There did not have to be.	Der hoegde net te wêzen.
Has anyone seen her?	Hat immen har sjoen?
This time we are both ready.	Dizze kear binne wy ​​beide klear.
I had never heard of it.	Ik hie der noch nea fan heard.
I talk to her almost every day.	Ik praat hast alle dagen mei har.
It's the girl who does that.	It is it famke dat dat docht.
Remember, forever and ever.	Tink mar, foar altyd en altyd.
Do not do this to me.	Doch dit net oan my.
Many are still.	In protte binne noch.
Want from me.	Wol fan my.
Of course, that makes it happen.	Fansels, dat makket it barre.
I was just not interested this time.	Ik wie gewoan net ynteressearre dizze kear.
This must happen.	Dit moat barre.
Come on in.	Kom yn.
No chance at all.	Gjin kâns hielendal.
He is also careful.	Hy is ek foarsichtich.
He himself had thought much the same thing.	Hy hie sels folle itselde tocht.
We'm in bed.	Wy binne op bêd.
The two met a few days ago.	De twa moete in pear dagen lyn.
We should have gone two or three times.	Wy moatte twa of trije kear gien wêze.
Maybe a lot of things.	Miskien in protte dingen.
I know it right.	Ik wit it krekt.
It's all in place.	It is allegear op syn plak.
Maybe she was on her way out.	Miskien wie se op 'e wei út.
This is very clear.	Dit is hiel dúdlik.
I love her very much.	Ik hâld fan har tige.
Even if she was.	Sels as se wie.
But this is how it works.	Mar sa wurket it.
My father worked his whole life.	Myn heit wurke syn hiele libben.
No where to go.	Gjin wêr te gean.
The school allows young children to come to school.	De skoalle lit jonge bern nei skoalle komme.
He knows what she will say before she says it.	Hy wit wat se sizze sil foardat se it seit.
Which he does not really like.	Wat him net echt liket.
We do that a lot.	Dat dogge wy in protte.
But maybe that was enough.	Mar miskien wie it genôch.
We have a big family.	Wy hawwe in grutte famylje.
This can be true, and it can not.	Dit kin wier wêze, en it kin net.
Or maybe not.	Of miskien net.
They know we need to do something about it now.	Se witte dat wy der no wat oan dwaan moatte.
But there are not.	Mar der binne net.
These people are sick.	Dizze minsken binne siik.
Everyone wants that all.	Elkenien wol dat alles.
That’s what she told me, in her letter.	Dat fertelde se my, yn har brief.
I have to talk.	Ik moat prate.
We have to be careful.	Wy moatte foarsichtich wêze.
Or, in fact, whoever.	Of, eins, wa dan ek.
Thoughts on work.	Gedachten oer wurk.
But never scared.	Mar nea bang.
And it was.	En it wie.
You have to give people time.	Jo moatte minsken tiid jaan.
If nothing happens, you're good to go.	As der neat bart, binne jo goed om te gean.
So was his office.	Sa wie syn kantoar.
I looked after him closely.	Ik seach him goed nei.
Maybe you've seen that.	Miskien hawwe jo dat sjoen.
She has not seen him in a week.	Se hat him al in wike net sjoen.
She wanted to do everything.	Se woe alles dwaan.
Should we worry?	Moatte wy ús soargen meitsje?
I've told you that before.	Dat haw ik dy earder sein.
And for me.	En foar my.
I see it differently.	Ik sjoch it oars.
I knew better.	Ik wist better.
Still, that was not it.	Noch, dat wie it net.
Tomorrow on time.	Moarn op tiid.
You do not enter.	Jo geane net yn.
In a way, it was probably better.	Op in manier wie it wierskynlik better.
The words would not come.	De wurden soene net komme.
It was a long time ago.	It wie lang lyn.
You know she told us the truth.	Jo witte dat se ús de wierheid fertelde.
The word is out.	It wurd is út.
I could not talk or so.	Ik koe net prate of sa.
I sure think this would help.	Ik tink wis dat dit soe helpe.
Take my word for it.	Nim myn wurd foar it.
Everything is still on.	Alles is noch oan.
I look around.	Ik sjoch om my hinne.
It's the truth.	It is de wierheid.
We'll see you tomorrow.	Wy sille dy moarn sjen.
Just maybe this would actually work.	Krekt miskien soe dit eins wurkje.
I made this photo for you.	Ik haw dizze foto foar jo makke.
It was all but too true.	It wie allegear mar al te wier.
But they are not mine.	Mar se binne net fan my.
Maybe you come up with the time.	Miskien komme dy mei de tiid.
We'm not even sure he's one of us.	Wy binne der net iens wis fan dat hy ien fan ús is.
She looked at him.	Se seach nei him.
Nothing really gets better than that.	Neat wurdt echt better as dat.
I do not know her very well.	Ik ken har net sa goed.
He had no idea how he got there.	Hy hie gjin idee hoe't er dêr kommen wie.
A great job.	In grutte baan.
I will take care of him.	Ik sil foar him soargje.
It seemed to him like that.	It like him wol.
But that thing.	Mar dat ding.
What are you going for.	Wat geane jo nei.
This is for the best.	Dit is foar it bêste.
You know you can do this over and over again.	Jo witte dat jo dit wer en wer en wer kinne dwaan.
It's not the.	It is net de.
Even if they did not have it, they soon believe.	Al hiene se it net, se leauwe gau.
They are not children, exactly.	It binne gjin bern, krekt.
I'll make something of him.	Ik sil wat fan him meitsje.
So you can not think.	Sa kinne jo net tinke.
I'm not getting angry.	Ik wurd net lilk.
Who said what.	Wa sei wat.
I'm just worried about you.	Ik bin gewoan soargen oer dy.
But something else had happened.	Mar der wie wat oars bard.
If even this day.	As sels dizze dei.
He has lived in this city all his life.	Hy hat syn hiele libben yn dizze stêd wenne.
She could not wait.	Se koe net wachtsje.
I will not ask you again.	Ik sil dy net wer freegje.
She had said that a man was waiting for her.	Se hie sein dat in man op har wachte.
This interested me.	Dit ynteressearre my.
It's a dog's life.	It is in hûn syn libben.
It happened here.	It barde hjir.
That will be nice.	Dat sil moai wêze.
The woman knew the boy was coming.	De frou wist dat de jonge kaam.
They had talked about it, of course.	Se hiene it der fansels oer hân.
Neither will we ever.	Ek sille wy nea.
I love being me.	Ik hâld fan my te wêzen.
She had seen it all.	Se hie it allegear sjoen.
I'm not here as one.	Ik bin hjir net as ien.
And both would be at the meeting.	En beide soene by de gearkomste wêze.
Let everyone know what you are doing.	Lit elkenien witte wat jo dogge.
These are my things.	Dit binne myn dingen.
Even if they did this today, it would be too late.	Sels as se dit hjoed diene, soe it te let wêze.
Today was the day.	Hjoed wie de dei.
I arrived in town an hour ago.	Ik kaam in oere lyn yn 'e stêd.
He arrived just in time.	Hy kaam krekt op 'e tiid.
Now was my chance.	No wie myn kâns.
The two are different.	De twa binne oars.
I should not have said anything.	Ik hie neat sizze moatten.
I'll be back in an hour.	Ik kom oer in oere werom.
The next morning.	De folgjende moarn.
I was his everything.	Ik wie syn alles.
And they think they know how good that is.	En se tinke dat se witte hoe goed dat is.
They do not tell them that they are doing it wrong.	Se fertelle har net dat se it ferkeard dogge.
She would love to see if she was okay.	Se soe graach sjen oft se wie goed.
I have an idea for what we can make.	Ik haw in idee foar wat wy kinne meitsje.
It has to do with things like faith.	It hat te krijen mei dingen as leauwe.
She felt something give.	Se fielde wat jaan.
Now we have to go.	No moatte wy gean.
I said you should stick with me.	Ik sei dat jo my der by hâlde moatte.
This is just not the case.	Dit is gewoan net sa.
But in it !!.	Mar yn it!!.
We're going to see.	Wy geane te sjen.
I'm just waiting.	Ik wachtsje gewoan.
But we are together now.	Mar wy binne no tegearre.
There may be.	Der kinne wêze.
I had a way of making some money.	Ik hie in manier om in bytsje jild te meitsjen.
You only get one chance.	Jo krije mar ien kâns.
I, for one, will have nothing to do with it.	Ik, foar ien, sil hawwe neat te krijen mei it.
Let it out.	Lit it út.
She had no reason to go back.	Se hie gjin reden om werom te gean.
She really knows how to drive.	Se wit echt hoe te riden.
You will not be wrong.	Jo sille net ferkeard wêze.
Tell her you're worried about her.	Fertel har dat jo soargen oer har binne.
I was always looking forward to this day.	Ik seach altyd út nei dizze dei.
I knew it would.	Ik wist dat it soe.
You have to see things the right way.	Jo moatte de dingen op 'e goede manier sjen.
Since we met.	Sûnt wy moete.
You should never give in.	Jo moatte nea jaan yn.
Very good of him.	Hiel goed fan him.
Once a month.	Ien kear yn 'e moanne.
But he would be happy to see her.	Mar hy soe bliid wêze om har te sjen.
Well, there is only one thing left.	No, der is noch mar ien ding.
And it certainly made her happy.	En it makke har wis bliid.
I hurt one more time.	Ik die noch ien sear.
Work on it.	Wurkje der oan.
It was here first.	It wie hjir earst.
It would also not be the last time.	It soe ek net de lêste kear wêze.
Life here is not easy.	It libben hjir is net maklik.
Had a guy with him.	Hie in keardel by him.
I have no regrets.	Ik ha gjin spyt.
You just never get the chance to do that.	Jo krije gewoan noait de kâns om dat te dwaan.
I probably have two friends.	Ik haw wierskynlik twa freonen.
I was not.	Ik wie net.
I have not lived here long enough.	Ik haw hjir net lang genôch wenne.
It would be wrong not to.	It soe ferkeard wêze om net.
But people do that.	Mar minsken dogge dat.
My book is just both.	Myn boek is gewoan beide.
You can not believe what he says.	Jo kinne net leauwe wat er seit.
And that seems right.	En dat liket krekt.
You can make two words.	Jo kinne twa wurden meitsje.
There has to be a better way!	Der moat in bettere manier wêze!
It's too bad.	It is te min.
Then back to me.	Dan werom nei my.
Does not come every day.	Komt net alle dagen.
Which they can no longer be happy about.	Wêr't se net mear bliid oer wurde kinne.
I think we did.	Ik tink dat wy diene.
He looked so good.	Hy seach der sa goed út.
I just want to get out of here.	Ik wol hjir gewoan wei.
When he died, he left everything to his family.	Doe't er stoar, liet er alles oan syn famylje oer.
The police are here.	De plysje is hjir.
So here too.	Sa ek hjir.
This is where they met.	Dit is wêr't se moete.
I liked the house.	Ik mocht fan it hûs.
See here.	Sjoch hjir.
Well, she went away with her husband.	No, se gie fuort mei har man.
I would pay to see him again.	Ik soe betelje om him wer te sjen.
But that, of course, is your problem.	Mar dat is fansels dyn probleem.
He could never say where it started.	Hy koe nea sizze wêr't it begûn.
You have to tell them the truth, whatever.	Jo moatte har de wierheid fertelle, wat dan ek.
The reason for doing this is the following.	De reden om dit te dwaan is de folgjende.
There's the money.	Dêr sit it jild.
Probably more.	Wierskynlik mear wêze.
I was very much with her.	Ik wie hiel mei har.
Nobody loves her.	Nimmen hâldt fan har.
He said he liked it a lot.	Hy sei dat er it in protte mocht.
I need to talk to him.	Ik moat mei him prate.
We agree on so many things.	Wy iens oer safolle dingen.
We are like her family.	Wy binne as har famylje.
He said it would be this.	Hy sei dat it dit wêze soe.
No way to say how much, but certainly more than one.	Gjin manier om te sizzen hoefolle, mar wis mear as ien.
Now if only we could keep it that way.	No as wy it mar sa hâlde kinne.
I really wanted to give you a chance.	Ik woe jo echt in kâns jaan.
His mother died when he was a boy.	Syn mem stoar doe't hy in jonge wie.
That had never happened to me.	Dat wie my noait bard.
I've never heard of that word before, but it works for me.	Ik hearde noch nea fan dat wurd foar, mar it wurket foar my.
There has to be a better way to do this.	D'r moat in bettere manier wêze om dit te dwaan.
The only people out there were those good so far.	De iennichste minsken út wiene dy oant no goed.
He needed money.	Hy hie jild nedich.
It does, and it should.	It docht, en it moat.
If it can.	As it kin.
It had to now.	It moast no.
They never had children.	Se hawwe nea bern krigen.
She probably did not know anyone there.	Se koe dêr wierskynlik net ien.
Tell me where you are.	Fertel my wêr't jo binne.
You and your friend will never be the same.	Jo en jo freon sille nea itselde wêze.
Her car died again.	Har auto stoar wer.
I feel so bad.	Ik fiel my sa min.
Well, that may be what's going to happen.	No, dat kin wêze wat der barre sil.
Do your thing.	Doch dyn ding.
But there is no such thing.	Mar der is net sa'n ding.
It had never been.	It hie nea west.
You can hope for the better.	Jo kinne it better hoopje.
I did not like this book.	Ik fûn dit boek net leuk.
Whether we like it or not.	Oft wy it leuk fine of net.
Or another man.	Of in oare man.
But you did not tell.	Mar do hast it net ferteld.
The evening was difficult.	De jûn wie dreech.
We know very little about him.	Wy witte hiel min oer him.
Do not worry, they are easy.	Sit gjin soargen, se binne maklik.
There was so much food to eat!	Der wie safolle iten te iten!
I never bought them for you.	Ik haw har noait foar dy kocht.
To talk me out of it.	Om my der út te praten.
We will not hurt you.	Wy sille jo net sear dwaan.
No one has ever seen it.	Nimmen hat it ea sjoen.
That's what I want to try today.	Dat wol ik hjoed besykje.
See them for what they are.	Sjoch se foar wat se binne.
I think everything is better if you can make it fun.	Ik tink dat alles better is as jo it leuk meitsje kinne.
It's just money.	It is gewoan jild.
I felt very angry.	Ik fielde my tige lilk.
I think that will make a great movie.	Ik tink dat sil meitsje in grutte film.
I hope it goes well.	Ik hoopje dat it goed komt.
I want you to know that.	Ik wol dat jo dat witte.
We were only a few years old.	Wy wiene mar in pear jier âld.
Being nice is what we're trying to be here.	Wês aardich is wat wy hjir besykje te wêzen.
Do not tell anyone who has told you.	Fertel it net oan ien dy't jo ferteld hat.
They stop eating.	Se hâlde op mei iten.
Or by them.	Of troch har.
But that's wrong.	Mar dat is ferkeard.
He did not feel good about anyone or anything.	Hy fielde him net goed oer ien of wat.
There was nothing wrong with him.	Der wie neat oan him.
He was not ready, he was not ready.	Hy wie net klear, hy wie net klear.
He knows it will not be easy.	Hy wit dat it net maklik wurde sil.
If you know what you're doing and why, it's good.	As jo ​​​​witte wat jo dogge en wêrom, is it goed.
But you are very good at your job, and we need you.	Mar do bist hiel goed op dyn wurk, en wy hawwe dy nedich.
You can make it yourself.	Jo kinne it sels meitsje.
She was a beautiful girl.	Se wie in moai famke.
Just last year it was.	Krekt ferline jier wie it.
He now had a job, a good one.	Hy hie no in baan, in goede.
We should not.	Wy moatte net.
I see that now.	Dat sjoch ik no.
You can be whatever you want.	Jo kinne wêze wat jo wolle.
It goes on and on and on.	It giet troch en wurket ek.
So he worked.	Sa wurke er.
They were just there.	Se wiene der gewoan.
I believe he has.	Ik leau dat hy hat.
He put in a few more hours on his new job.	Hy sette noch in pear oeren yn op syn nije baan.
I think this is it.	Ik tink dat dit it is.
We can never.	Wy kinne nea.
So she looked at him.	Dat se seach him oan.
Have a good day?	Hawwe jo in goede dei?
His friend looked after well, ready to help when needed.	Syn freon seach goed nei, ree om te helpen as it nedich wie.
Whatever happens tomorrow, it does not matter.	Wat der moarn ek bart, it makket neat út.
I should not have come to work today.	Ik hie hjoed net oan it wurk komme moatten.
That is the only life that ever exists.	Dat is it ienige libben dat der ea is.
They knew what he had done.	Se wisten wat er dien hie.
I believe everything she says.	Ik leau alles wat se seit.
But nothing was done.	Mar der waard neat dien.
Then you have to do that.	Dan moatte jo dat dwaan.
He has no place here by her now.	Hy hat hjir no gjin plak troch har.
It's exactly what you need to do.	It is krekt wat jo moatte dwaan.
Of course they are talking.	Fansels binne se oan it praten.
And he comes into everything.	En hy komt yn alles.
That's good for no one.	Dat is foar gjinien goed.
I give in.	Ik jou my yn.
Whatever that may be.	Wat dat ek wêze kin.
It just sat there.	It siet der mar út.
We do not have much time to make good.	Wy hawwe net folle tiid om goed te meitsjen.
You have to go inside the house.	Jo moatte yn 'e hûs gean.
Have more of him.	Hawwe mear fan him.
He came often and stayed long.	Hy kaam faak en bleau lang.
We know we both live here.	Wy witte dat wy hjir beide wenje.
Be very careful, my young friend.	Wês tige foarsichtich, myn jonge freon.
She was exactly what you think.	Se wie krekt wat jo tinke.
That you help them.	Dat jo helpe se.
But maybe that was good.	Mar miskien wie dat goed.
They never had a chance.	Se hiene nea in kâns.
I've heard a lot of this.	Ik haw hjir in protte fan heard.
If you're telling the truth, we're gonna go.	As jo ​​​​de wierheid fertelle, dan moatte wy gean.
They could not keep her if she did not want to stay.	Se koene har net hâlde as se net bliuwe woe.
They are afraid of the police.	Se binne bang foar de plysje.
But not here or now.	Mar net hjir of no.
But we're afraid he will.	Mar wy binne bang dat hy sil.
They will not find it.	Se sille it net fine.
You know how these things work.	Jo witte hoe't dizze dingen wurkje.
He worked hard all morning.	Hy hat de hiele moarn hurd wurke.
I took mine with me.	Ik naam myn mei.
He would buy that book.	Hy soe dat boek keapje.
Well, you have to eat well.	Goed, jo moatte goed ite.
But that was good.	Mar dat wie goed.
The problem is that they do not have.	It probleem is dat se net hawwe.
No one had ever done that.	Nimmen hie dat ea dien.
It may take time.	It kin tiid nimme.
You will know things they will not.	Jo sille dingen witte dy't se net sille.
If you buy now.	As jo ​​keapje no.
He was very angry.	Hy wie tige lilk.
And boy did he look good.	En jonge seach er goed út.
She wanted more for us.	Se woe mear foar ús.
You can stay with us at home.	Jo kinne by ús thús bliuwe.
They know what they want and where they can get it.	Se witte wat se wolle en wêr't se it krije kinne.
Do not do this.	Doch dit net.
And maybe one day come back soon.	En miskien in dei gau werom komme.
I will not buy the new car.	Ik sil de nije auto net keapje.
Then you have this thing back here.	Dan hawwe jo dit ding hjir werom.
I try to give back to other people.	Ik besykje te jaan werom oan oare minsken.
Maybe he had not heard her well.	Miskien hie er har net goed heard.
Me and my parents.	Ik en myn âlden.
I can not stay with you here.	Ik kin hjir net by dy bliuwe.
Don't mind.	Lit mar.
We were here.	Wy wiene hjir.
Life is very, very good !.	It libben is heul, heul goed!.
We are very happy.	Wy binne tige bliid.
They make so much more money.	Se meitsje sa mear jild.
Would have nothing now.	Soe no neat hawwe.
Other days there is nothing good.	Oare dagen is der neat goed.
I can't believe it.	Ik kin it net leauwe.
Or look around.	Of om hinne sjen.
That was really nice of you.	Dat wie echt aardich fan dy.
It just looks good.	It sjocht der gewoan goed út.
I'll give you everything.	Ik sil dy alles jaan.
They will eat them!	Se sille har ite!
Even if that's true, it will not help much.	Sels as dat wier is, sil it net folle helpe.
It can 't do me any good either.	It kin my ek net dwaan.
They do not have to see that.	Dat hoege se net te sjen.
So let's tell them.	Dat litte wy se sizze.
Do what makes you happy.	Doch wat dy bliid makket.
And then you will never come back.	En dan komme jo noait wer werom.
I know exactly what you need.	Ik wit krekt wat jo nedich hawwe.
There are so many.	Der binne safolle.
They had been so careful.	Se hiene sa foarsichtich west.
She's been there a year now.	Se hat dêr no in jier west.
Probably the er I.	Wierskynlik die er ek.
No one else would do it.	Nimmen oars soe dwaan.
And you are.	En do bist.
Would not want to.	Soe net wolle.
Everyone has to work from there.	Elkenien moat dêr út wurkje.
This is how it is done.	Dit is hoe't it dien wurdt.
I will not want to say anything else.	Ik sil neat oars sizze wolle.
I'm sure you're out in a month or two.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo oer in moanne as twa út binne.
But, you know?	Mar, witte jo?
I think it's happening.	Ik tink dat it bart.
If it goes well, there is nothing.	As it goed giet, is der neat.
It just could not be true.	It koe gewoan net wier wêze.
I just looked at him.	Ik like krekt op him.
She did not know that, but she did.	Dat mocht se net witte, mar dat die se fansels.
And they will find it too.	En se sille it ek fine.
That man could not do his job.	Dy man koe syn wurk net.
The man was not happy.	De man wie net bliid.
About a boy.	Oer in jonge.
That's what we needed from him.	Dat hiene wy ​​fan him nedich.
I know that.	Dat wit ik wol.
This was one for me.	Dit wie ien foar my.
He looked at me.	Hy seach my oan.
In fact, he was not there.	Eins wie er der net.
This kind of thing.	Dit soarte fan dingen.
It would come.	It soe komme.
He will go to school.	Hy sil nei skoalle.
We have made.	Wy hawwe makke.
Nothing else has worked.	Neat oars hat wurke.
She will wake up early that morning.	Se sil dy moarn betiid wekker meitsje.
I want to say we know what to do.	Ik wol sizze dat wy witte wat te dwaan.
Where there is life is hope.	Wêr't libben is, is hope.
Also, those were under him.	Ek wiene dy ûnder him.
You want to live in that house.	Jo wolle yn dat hûs wenje.
We were without hope.	Wy wiene sûnder hope.
Would go to the old man too.	Soe ek nei de âld man.
That's all for you.	Dat binne jo alles.
And maybe not have been.	En miskien net west hawwe.
Tomorrow is our last day here.	Moarn is ús lêste dei hjir.
You have to tell the truth.	Jo moatte de wierheid fertelle.
It's something to see.	It is wat te sjen.
We are good.	Wy binne goed.
Whatever happens now, he still wants out of it.	Wat der no ek bart, hy wol der noch út.
Things can be good.	Dingen kinne goed wêze.
She makes it up.	Se makket it op.
This would take money.	Dit soe jild nimme.
Not even your life.	Net iens dyn libben.
She had to go back to her house.	Se moast werom nei har hûs.
Something had to be done about that as well.	Dêr soe ek wat oan dien wurde moatte.
This boy was good.	Dizze jonge wie goed.
I could not be late.	Ik koe net let wêze.
But we did not know it.	Mar wy wisten it net.
The family was fine.	De famylje wie goed.
Hold off a bit.	Hâld in bytsje ôf.
It was like working everyone in one room.	It wie as wurke elkenien yn ien keamer.
I came back.	Ik kaam werom.
You do not have to talk to anyone.	Jo hoege net oant ien te praten.
I'm sure this is it.	Ik bin der wis fan dat dit it is.
He will stay here, with me.	Hy sil hjir bliuwe, by my.
I wondered if he had been home for that party.	Ik frege my ôf oft er thús west hie foar dat feest.
You can do nothing.	Jo kinne neat dwaan.
They did things to him.	Se hawwe him dingen dien.
I tried something with this, but it does not work.	Ik besocht wat mei dit, mar it wurket net.
I kept making everyone and everything around me wrong.	Ik bleau elkenien en al it oare om my ferkeard meitsje.
He would not help you.	Hy soe dy net helpe.
But it is not enough.	Mar it is net genôch.
One comes in, one goes out.	Ien komt yn, ien giet út.
He just could not win against her.	Hy koe gewoan net tsjin har winne.
For the first time.	Foar de earste kear.
He liked that.	Dat mocht hy graach.
Before we knew about any of this.	Foardat wy wisten oer ien fan dit.
Her mother had been too.	Har mem hie ek west.
You need to do better next time.	Jo moatte de folgjende kear better dwaan.
He could not do that.	Hy koe dat net dwaan.
There's nothing else in the movie.	D'r is neat oars yn 'e film.
But he soon realized what was happening.	Mar hy realisearre al gau wat der barde.
Everything happens for a reason.	Alles bart foar in reden.
And and give a hand in.	En en jou in hân yn.
I do not see it.	Ik sjoch it net.
He did not care much.	Hy hie der net folle oan.
I knew her old man.	Ik koe har âld man.
But it's not good.	Mar it is net goed.
Hurry up, kids, otherwise we'll be late for school!	Hast op, bern, oars komme wy te let op skoalle!
By me they had been.	Troch my hiene se west.
He liked working there.	Hy wurke dêr graach.
It felt like she could see into him.	It fielde as koe se yn him sjen.
Maybe he would never be.	Miskien soe er nea wêze.
It was really different.	It wie echt oars.
And boy did she get out of there well.	En jonge kaam se der goed út.
I had never seen it today.	Ik hie it hjoed noch nea sjoen.
Be carefull!	Wês foarsichtich!
I wish we could be friends.	Ik winskje dat wy freonen kinne wêze.
She hoped she had never seen the woman again.	Se hope dat se de frou noait wer sjoen hie.
It's what gets things done.	It is wat dingen dien krije.
The man who died was not my father.	De man dy't stoar, dat wie myn heit net.
It's not even for me, really.	It is net iens foar my, echt.
We'll be back!	Wy komme werom!
Can you give me.	Kinne jo my jaan.
This can be found here.	Dit is hjir te finen.
That you want.	Dat jo wolle.
You get better.	Jo wurde better.
At this hour she can not eat.	Op dit oere kin se net ite.
Now something better.	No wat better.
Of course nothing like her.	Fansels neat as har.
I'm trying to do what's good.	Ik besykje te dwaan wat goed is.
Look at her hair.	Sjoch har hier.
I could not do it.	Ik koe it net dwaan.
It was hard, it was hard.	It wie dreech, it wie dreech.
But it was not just that.	Mar it wie net allinnich dat.
It really was a beautiful place.	It wie echt in moai plak.
No one had thought to do that before either.	Nimmen hie tocht dat earder ek te dwaan.
I do not want that.	Dat wol ik net.
A week ago, no one had heard from him.	In wike lyn hie nimmen fan him heard.
You are ready to be free.	Jo binne ree om frij te wêzen.
That was nothing.	Dat wie neat.
We'm sorry.	It spyt ús.
I was good for his money, and for more.	Ik wie goed foar syn jild, en foar mear.
She came home late.	Se kaam let thús.
See if this is still true.	Sjoch oft dit noch wier is.
And maybe never.	En miskien nea.
Now he could think.	No koe er tinke.
This is it! 	Dit is it!
In fact, things were very different.	Eins wiene dingen hiel oars.
Things were not right.	Dingen wiene net goed.
He can not see things so well.	Hy kin de dingen net sa goed sjen.
Going to love a child.	Gean fan in bern hâlde.
You have nothing more to do.	Jo hoege neat mear te dwaan.
I told him the truth.	Ik fertelde him de wierheid.
She would have almost seen this.	Se soe dit hast wol sjoen hawwe.
But tell your mother.	Mar fertel dyn mem.
And then there was the food.	En dan wie it iten.
And believe me, this work had to be done.	En leau my, dit wurk moast dien wurde.
We'll be tough. 	Wy sille hurd wêze. 
We need to get back and get it.	Wy moatte werom en krije it.
I've been waiting for that for so long.	Dêr ha ik al sa lang op wachte.
This has become a very nice thing.	Dit is in hiel moai ding wurden.
Let's not talk about it.	Lit ús dêr net oer prate.
It's a good idea, actually.	It is in goed idee, eins.
I do not even know why.	Ik wit sels net wêrom.
Wait until it goes away.	Wachtsje oant it fuort giet.
I have no problem with him.	Ik haw gjin probleem mei him.
You can have one like that, man.	Jo kinne sa ien hawwe, man.
It's just like being at home.	It is krekt as thús te wêzen.
Well, that's good.	No, dat is goed.
You will never believe what happened today.	Jo sille noait leauwe wat der hjoed barde.
Let's stay home.	Lit ús thús bliuwe.
I know it my whole life.	Ik wit it myn hiele libben.
But she had heard it before.	Mar se hie it earder heard.
And there's nothing more going on.	En der giet neat mear yn.
Do it another weekend.	Doch it noch in wykein.
I can not think or speak clearly.	Ik kin net dúdlik tinke of prate.
He wanted her with him.	Hy woe har by him.
I do not have the time.	Ik haw de tiid net.
You are different.	Do bist oars.
What is it about?	Wêr giet it oer.
He looked over at her.	Hy seach har oer.
Was worried there.	Wie dêr soargen.
You have enough time.	Jo hawwe genôch tiid.
It's actually one.	It is eins ien.
You can do whatever you need.	Jo kinne dwaan wat jo nedich hawwe.
It would be so here.	It soe hjir sa wêze.
We never get out of here.	Wy komme hjir noait wei.
I do not believe that.	Dat leau ik net.
Of course, this is not entirely true.	Fansels is dit net hielendal wier.
But that's not what's happening.	Mar dat is net wat der bart.
I would like to buy a house.	Ik wol graach in hûs keapje.
He's a really good guy.	Hy is in echt goede keardel.
I watched it for an hour.	Ik haw der in oere nei sjoen.
It is taking and giving.	It is nimme en jaan.
I would be fine with that.	Ik soe der wol goed mei wêze.
When she had nothing to say, it was late.	Doe't se gjin dingen hie om te sizzen, wie it let.
You think you know everything about them.	Jo tinke dat jo alles oer har witte.
But even with him it grows old.	Mar ek by him wurdt it âld.
Be surprised that no one expected it.	Wês ferrast dat gjinien it ferwachte.
First look and see.	Earst sjen en sjen.
Of course he did not want to.	Fansels woe er net.
Really ???, what are they doing with you ???.	Echt ???, wat dogge se mei dy ???.
They can try to figure it out.	Se kinne besykje út te finen.
She had never seen this man like that before.	Se hie dizze man noch noait sa sjoen.
You could be one of those people.	Jo kinne ien fan dy minsken wêze.
People, she says, are very different.	Minsken, seit se, binne hiel oars.
Maybe he could find her.	Miskien koe er har fine.
She was very surprised.	Se wie tige ferrast.
This was still his house.	Dit wie noch syn hûs.
Do not think about what happened last week.	Tink net oan wat der de lêste wike bard is.
Just that the girl was here.	Krekt dat it famke hjir wie.
The money goes to the good people.	It jild giet nei de goede minsken.
Actually, it felt like an open house.	Eins fielde it as in iepen hûs.
He was angry at himself.	Hy wie lilk op himsels.
I need to do something.	Ik moat wat dwaan.
I do not see that.	Dat sjoch ik net.
Be careful what you eat.	Wês foarsichtich wat jo ite.
Bad for him.	Min foar him.
But it can wait.	Mar it kin wachtsje.
You did not have him.	Do hiest him net.
It was my first time out there.	It wie myn earste kear út dêr.
Is there one?	Is der ien?
Long time no see.	Lang net sjoen.
I just live with my wife.	Ik wenje gewoan mei myn frou.
When the time comes, he will need you.	As de tiid komt, sil hy jo nedich hawwe.
I do not know how she does it.	Ik wit net hoe't se it docht.
We know how to come back.	Wy witte hoe't wy werom komme.
And and and.	En en en.
And he was not old.	En hy wie net âld.
You really should not do that.	Dat moatte jo eins net dwaan.
Things are not easy for me now.	Dingen binne net maklik foar my no.
It had nothing to do with her.	It hie neat mei har te krijen.
He was still reading.	Hy wie noch oan it lêzen.
Not much in the last year.	Net folle yn it lêste jier.
I got out of there.	Ik kaam der út.
Well, not good.	No, net goed.
She's been so good to me.	Se is sa goed foar my west.
I'm scared of her.	Ik bin bang foar har.
Just do not try it.	Besykje it gewoan net.
You probably will too.	Jo sille wierskynlik ek.
I liked working on it.	Ik mocht der graach oan wurkje.
It was in me.	It wie yn my.
And my father had no other children than me.	En myn heit hie gjin oare bern as ik.
He was nothing to her.	Hy wie neat foar har.
It was a time to give in.	It wie in tiid om yn te jaan.
I should just do it.	Ik soe it mar dwaan moatte.
In the letter.	Yn de brief.
It's just you and me now.	It binne no gewoan do en ik.
You can see forever.	Jo kinne foar altyd sjen.
It was more.	It wie mear.
But he did not ask me to do that.	Mar hy frege my der net nei.
They do not yet.	Dat dogge se noch net.
I will be happy to help you today.	Ik sil jo hjoed graach helpe.
You have to go.	Jo moatte gean.
He's a man.	Hy is in man.
I want you to tell me everything.	Ik wol dat jo my alles fertelle.
Everything has a time and a place.	Alles hat in tiid en in plak.
I read your new book.	Ik haw dyn nije boek lêzen.
I do not want to see this.	Ik wol dit net sjen.
One.	Ien.
But we have to get out of here.	Mar wy moatte hjir wei.
After school would be different.	Nei skoalle soe wêze oars.
I have to get out of here.	Ik moat hjir wei.
So do I.	Dat doch ik ek.
I just could not believe it.	Ik koe it gewoan net leauwe.
I thought this was how it should be done.	Ik tocht dat dit wie hoe't it dien wurde moast.
These are the.	Dit binne de.
She was with me, even when she was away.	Se wie by my, sels as se fuort wie.
I'll take him.	Ik sil him nimme.
And maybe they did.	En miskien hawwe se it dien.
She could have lived at this place though.	Se koe wol wenne oan dit plak.
None of us have ever seen or heard of him again.	Net ien fan ús hat him oait wer sjoen of heard.
He knows he has not.	Hy wit dat er net hat.
Maybe a little too much.	Miskien in bytsje te folle.
She's the only woman in his class.	It is de ienige frou yn syn klasse.
He would know if she had.	Hy soe witte oft se hie.
There was so much she did not know.	Der wie safolle dat se net wist.
I knew you.	Ik koe dy.
We can say nothing.	Wy kinne neat sizze.
Let's do this.	Lit ús dit dwaan.
But, for now.	Mar, foar no.
I told you what happened.	Ik fertelde jo wat der bard is.
Do whatever you want there.	Doch dêr wat jo wolle.
And will always be.	En sil altyd wêze.
Get ready for bed.	Meitsje jo klear foar bêd.
Well, that's all for today.	No, dat is alles foar hjoed.
Everything we can think of.	Alles wat wy tinke kinne.
But two months ago, he received a letter.	Mar twa moanne lyn krige er in brief.
Do you have a plan in mind?	Hawwe jo in plan yn gedachten?
He has to do it all himself.	Hy moat it allegear sels dwaan.
They got him.	Se krigen him.
You're a really good friend.	Jo binne in echt goede freonen.
Here is my question.	Hjir is myn fraach.
And tomorrow came again.	En moarn kaam der wer.
He looked out.	Hy seach der út.
What should that do.	Wat moat dat dwaan.
No one else seemed to get it.	Nimmen oars like it te krijen.
We had no time.	Wy hiene gjin tiid.
He was waiting for more.	Hy wachte op mear.
He had to see the truth.	Hy moast de wierheid sjen.
It went well for an hour.	It gie goed in oere troch.
But your mother died.	Mar dyn mem stoar.
I touched them.	Ik rekke se oan.
And of course my family is not alone.	En myn famylje is fansels net allinnich.
Everyone thought he would never return.	Elkenien tocht dat er noait werom soe.
It seemed like such a good idea.	It like sa'n goed idee.
There will be no problems from that.	Dêr sille gjin problemen fan komme.
If so, then so be it.	As it sa is, is it sa.
Everyone wants to talk about it.	Elkenien wol der oer prate.
She does not have to tell me again.	Se hoecht it my net wer te fertellen.
We agree with him.	Wy binne it mei him iens.
Look for someone to help.	Sjoch foar immen te helpen.
I'll tell him he does not need to talk to me.	Ik sil him sizze dat er net mei my prate hoecht.
Who will take care of our children?	Wa sil op ús bern soargje?
And look at me.	En sjoch my oan.
I wanted you.	Ik woe dy.
In the past there lived a child.	Yn it ferline wenne der in bern.
He still loves her.	Hy hâlde noch fan har.
They had done it.	Se hiene it dien.
I did the same to her.	Ik die itselde oan har.
But that is not exactly true.	Mar dat is net krekt wier.
Looks good still.	Sjocht der noch goed út.
Do you believe they are accurate?	Jo leauwe dat se krekt binne?
No one else left.	Nimmen oars oer.
What happens, happens.	Wat bart, bart.
However, he was not surprised.	Hoe dan ek, hy wie net ferrast.
Everyone has a car.	Elkenien hat in auto.
But he had nothing to do.	Mar hy hie neat te dwaan.
Well done!	Goed dien!
But wait an hour.	Mar wachtsje in oere.
Things have gotten better.	Dingen binne better wurden.
I do not know how, but he is.	Ik wit net hoe, mar hy is.
In bad faith.	Yn min leauwe.
Those people are also hard to help.	Dy minsken binne ek dreech te helpen.
I thought they were gone.	Ik tocht dat se fuort wiene.
But we got nothing else.	Mar wy krigen neat oars.
It's right here.	It is hjir krekt.
I was not allowed to see it there.	Ik mocht it dêr net sjen.
It really happened.	It is echt bard.
If you think you are surprised.	As jo ​​tinke dat jo binne ferrast.
She said it was okay.	Se sei dat it goed wie.
They are a woman and a man.	It binne in frou en in man.
That's what they tell me.	Dat sizze se my.
He must have been a handsome man.	Hy wie wol in moai man.
He had to do something.	Hy moast wat dwaan.
She had said the same thing to him.	Se hie itselde tsjin him sein.
We will find them.	Wy sille se fine.
And she did not know that you knew.	En se wist net dat jo wisten.
There was never any water.	Der wie noait wetter.
She walked to the door.	Se rûn nei de doar.
Not so long.	Net sa lang.
I must say.	Ik moat sizze.
But he could not say that.	Mar dat koe er net sizze.
She looked up at her.	Se seach op nei har.
And that is the work we are doing now.	En dat is it wurk dat wy no dogge.
She's not happy.	Se is net bliid.
That he would be a nothing.	Dat hy soe in neat wêze.
And that would say something.	En dat soe wat sizze.
Of course we are that.	Fansels binne wy ​​dat.
I'm so scared of him.	Ik bin sa bang foar him.
You've never met him.	Jo hawwe him nea moete.
This is their money.	Dit is har jild.
They should be there in a day.	Se moatte der oer in dei wêze.
We have what you need.	Wy hawwe wat jo nedich hawwe.
Mary was not entirely surprised.	Mary wie net hielendal ferrast.
You want her to hurt you.	Jo wolle dat se jo min docht.
Please do not be like that.	Wês asjebleaft net sa.
Let me know if the question is not clear.	Lit my witte as de fraach net dúdlik is.
And we have heard them.	En wy hawwe har heard.
He wanted them to know he was there too.	Hy woe dat se wisten dat er der ek wie.
Much more than that.	In protte mear as dat.
It seemed so clear now.	It like no sa dúdlik.
I do not agree.	Ik bin it net iens.
And we want it to happen this year.	En wy wolle dat it dit jier bart.
He just wanted to be home.	Hy woe allinnich thús.
I got nothing, man.	Ik krige neat, man.
But it works really well.	Mar it wurket echt goed.
That makes it believable.	Dat docht it leauwe.
Well, that was when it was ready.	No, wie doe't it klear wie.
I agree with the police.	Ik bin it mei de plysje iens.
And they can be a few days without me.	En se kinne in pear dagen sûnder my.
Otherwise she was actually very nice.	Oars wie se eins hiel aardich.
There may be more.	Der kinne noch mear.
It works for us.	It wurket foar ús.
Everything that wants and needs to be done would still be done.	Alles wat wol en moat, soe noch dien wurde.
She can do a good job.	Se kin in goed wurk dwaan.
Very happy to be here.	Hiel bliid om hjir te wêzen.
It really is not.	It is echt net.
To hurt more people.	Om mear minsken sear te dwaan.
Even now he did not know why.	Ek no wist er net wêrom.
There is only one problem.	Der is mar ien probleem.
I still had a lot there, in those days.	Ik hie der noch in protte, yn dy dagen.
It really made our day.	It hat ús dei echt makke.
This is not a good idea.	Dit is gjin goed idee.
It's there.	It is dêr.
Let no one tell you otherwise.	Lit gjinien jo oars fertelle.
Not yet.	Noch net.
They said we needed help.	Se seine dat wy help nedich hawwe.
They were exactly the same as each other.	Se wiene krekt itselde as elkoar.
I do not know why, but that felt good.	Ik wit net wêrom, mar dat fielde goed.
That was my job as a wife and mother.	Dat wie myn wurk as frou en mem.
It's wrong that it should be here.	It is ferkeard dat it hjir moat.
Is that what you want.	Is dat wat jo wolle.
That's exactly what a woman is.	Dat is krekt wat in frou is.
If you believe you have the truth, then go your way.	As jo ​​​​leauwe dat jo de wierheid hawwe, gean dan jo wei.
Not much, that's for sure.	Net folle, dat is wis.
You never have.	Jo nea hawwe.
It was wrong.	It wie ferkeard.
Which of course they were not.	Wat se fansels net wiene.
They were nowhere to be seen.	Se wiene net wêr te sjen.
But they are not happy either.	Mar se binne ek net bliid.
Take them both out of here.	Nim se beide hjir wei.
But that was not always easy.	Mar dat wie net altyd maklik.
It was in those days.	It wie yn dy dagen.
I'm at the office every day.	Ik bin alle dagen op kantoar.
I never had the chance to go back to the room.	Ik haw noait de kâns hân om werom te gean nei de keamer.
But it was too late now.	Mar it wie no te let.
So it has always been.	Sa hat it altyd west.
This, of course, would not be easy.	Dit soe fansels net maklik wurde.
It's not bad, it's just not very good.	It is net min, it is gewoan net heul goed.
Lots to say, but did very little.	In protte te sizzen, mar die heul min.
I saw him here.	Ik seach him hjir.
All his life he had worked hard.	Syn hiele libben hie er hurd wurke.
Now the time never seemed right.	No like de tiid noait goed.
That's what it is.	Dat is wat it is.
It was a lot.	It wie in protte.
And in more ways than one.	En op mear as ien manier.
It just felt good.	It fielde gewoan goed.
Hold your hair back with one hand.	Hâld dyn hier werom mei ien hân.
You can really do it.	Jo kinne it echt dwaan.
I never stayed in.	Ik bleau noait yn.
It would be fine now.	It soe no wol goed komme.
Her problems eat him up.	Har problemen ite him op.
They just had no idea what they were for.	Se hiene gewoan gjin idee fan wêr't se foar wiene.
I'm not at all into that idea.	Ik bin hielendal net fan dat idee.
I met a lot of people at that party.	Ik moete in protte minsken op dat feest.
There were still things he had to do.	Der wiene noch dingen dy't er dwaan moast.
Which was a thing.	Wat in ding wie.
I knew they had nothing to do with me.	Ik wist dat se neat oan my hiene.
Try not to worry.	Besykje gjin soargen te meitsjen.
Whatever you have in the house.	Wat jo ek yn 'e hûs hawwe.
That makes them good or bad.	Dat makket se goed of min.
I give him a job, show him.	Ik jou him in baan, lit him sjen.
He said that was very true.	Hy sei dat in protte wier wie.
He can be really good.	Hy kin echt goed wêze.
These people do not.	Dizze minsken net.
We just have to show that.	Dat moatte wy mar sjen litte.
I will visit you again in one month.	Ik sil jo oer ien moanne wer besykje.
Everything would be fine.	Alles soe goed wêze.
Believe me, .	Leau my, .
I love my life just the way it is.	Ik hâld fan myn libben krekt hoe't it is.
Word came around.	Wurd kaam om.
She looked nice.	Se like aardich.
I did not look at him.	Ik seach nei him net nei my.
And so it came out.	En sa kaam it út.
This had happened before.	Dit wie earder bard.
There was none.	Dêr wie gjin.
She keeps up with me.	Se hâldt mei my op.
I knew they would not become like my father.	Ik wist dat se net as myn heit wurde soene.
Even though.	Sels.
Here we find everyone busy.	Hjir fine wy ​​elkenien drok.
I see him.	Ik sjoch him.
Another better way.	In oare bettere manier.
He had no time.	Hy hie gjin tiid.
But no one knew what to do about it.	Mar nimmen wist der wat oan te dwaan.
I did not want to go.	Ik woe net gean.
That really is not the best idea.	Dat is echt net it bêste idee.
He left us there.	Hy liet ús dêr fuort.
This should not be done.	Dit moat net dien wurde.
That was enough for me.	Dat wie my genôch.
It was time to go.	It wie tiid om te gean.
Maybe he should go to one.	Miskien moat er nei ien gean.
As soon as he could, he saw it again.	Sa gau as er koe, seach er it wer.
Big problems.	Grutte problemen.
Like more than one of these things.	Like mear as ien fan dizze dingen.
There was only a little left.	Der wie mar in bytsje oer.
They are not his.	Se binne net fan him.
There are many questions.	Der binne in protte fragen.
He asked me for money.	Hy frege my om jild.
They were his idea, not mine.	Se wiene syn idee, net myn.
I wanted away from her.	Ik woe fan har ôf.
When are we expected to arrive?	Wannear wurde wy ferwachte te kommen?
My very bad.	Myn tige min.
To be there for me.	Om der foar my te wêzen.
That’s what everyone here does.	Dat docht elkenien hjir.
That must have been nice.	Dat moat moai west hawwe.
We have been here our whole lives.	Wy binne hjir ús hiele libben west.
Not exactly now.	No krekt net.
They will take your money.	Se sille nimme jo jild.
And it felt that way.	En it fielde wol sa.
He knew what needed to be done.	Hy wist wat der dien wurde moast.
He said exactly the same thing.	Hy sei krekt itselde ding.
So much is clear to me.	Safolle is my dúdlik.
But for food.	Mar foar iten.
But otherwise he looks good.	Mar oars liket er wol goed.
I had never seen my father like that.	Ik hie myn heit noait sa sjoen.
My friend could not afford it.	Myn freon koe it net betelje.
It's across the room.	It is oer de keamer.
She knew why he came.	Se wist wêrom't er kaam.
This does not really stop.	Dit hâldt net echt op.
I had a word with him.	Ik haw in wurd mei him hân.
I get asked a lot about how I can find a job.	Ik wurd in protte frege oer hoe't ik in baan kin fine.
Or be sick.	Of siik wêze.
There was room for no one.	Der wie plak foar gjinien.
This is the work he has done for himself.	Dit is it wurk dat er foar himsels makke hat.
We have it, and we are here.	Wy hawwe it, en wy binne hjir.
Not even by them.	Net iens troch har.
It was hard for her to say it.	It wie dreech foar har om it te sizzen.
Which is just fine by me.	Wat is gewoan goed troch my.
Everyone liked her.	Elkenien mocht har graach.
My father will be angry.	Myn heit sil lilk wêze.
I just do not agree with that.	Ik bin it der gewoan net mei iens.
They were afraid of being wrong.	Se wiene bang om ferkeard te wêzen.
He does not live here, and he does not like him.	Hy wennet hjir net, en hy liket net op him.
She was tired from work.	Se wie wurch fan it wurk.
He worked hard but never made much money.	Hy wurke hurd, mar makke noait folle jild.
She was happy to go.	Se wie bliid om te gean.
You made this thing and people like it.	Jo hawwe dit ding makke en minsken fine it leuk.
Let us know how that works for you.	Lit ús witte hoe't dat foar jo wurket.
We have done good work against him.	Wy hawwe goed wurk tsjin him dien.
Tell me you love me.	Fertel my dat jo fan my hâlde.
Two not.	Twa net.
I want to see you up and over.	Ik wol dy op en oer sjen.
Well, that's not about us.	No, dat giet ús net oer.
That's what you find.	Dat fine jo.
If you did, you would have no friend for long.	As jo ​​dat dien hawwe, soene jo lang gjin freon hawwe.
I'm not done.	Ik bin net klear.
Well, a friend.	No, in freon.
But it's still coming.	Mar it komt noch.
Someone must have told you.	Immen moat dy sein hawwe.
What you think works.	Wat jo tinke wurket.
I would like to say something here.	Ik soe hjir wol wat sizze wolle.
He convinced me to get involved.	Hy hat my oertsjûge om mei te dwaan.
He is.	Hy is.
Please do not take a picture.	Meitsje asjebleaft gjin foto.
It's her last day.	It is har lêste dei.
He just wasn't ready to see it.	Hy wie gewoan net ree om it te sjen.
You can try this and find that it is not for you.	Jo kinne dit besykje en fine dat it net foar jo is.
She wondered if he even knew what it was.	Se frege har ôf oft er sels wist wat it wie.
A day or two, that's all.	In dei as twa, dat is alles.
This was my last chance.	Dit wie myn lêste kâns.
It's for me, he thought.	It is foar my, tocht er.
But tell me this.	Mar fertel my dit.
Such are the things.	Sa binne de dingen.
It has not.	It hat net.
Much more could be done.	Der koe folle mear dien wurde.
You would be surprised.	Jo soene ferrast wêze.
I just do not know which way to go.	Ik wit gewoan net hokker wei ik moat nimme.
Think about what you want.	Tink oer wat jo wolle.
She does not do that, she has not done that for a long time.	Dat docht se net, dat hat se al lang net.
Everything is on time.	Alles is by de tiid.
Once, twice, three times.	Ien kear, twa kear, trije kear.
He would not let me.	Hy soe my net litte litte.
So he said so much.	Sa sei er safolle.
I'm very happy with that.	Ik bin der tige bliid mei.
Run my hand over his hair.	Rûn myn hân oer syn hier.
But let me tell you, it's the best.	Mar lit my dy sizze, it is de bêste.
It obviously would not have been in place there.	It soe dêr fansels net te plak west hawwe.
He started talking.	Hy begûn te praten.
And it was the opportunity that came first.	En it wie de kâns dy't earst kaam.
Nobody really knows what happened.	Nimmen wit echt wat der bard is.
No one was eating.	Gjinien wie iten.
I'll be out of the office today.	Ik sil hjoed út it kantoar wêze.
No one should buy this.	Nimmen moat dit keapje.
Or keep them.	Of hâld har.
One of us had to leave.	Ien fan ús moast fuort.
Dad made it easy.	Heit makke it maklik.
He will be here tomorrow.	Hy sil hjir moarn wêze.
It does not come out much.	It komt net folle út.
I liked him a lot.	Ik hie him in protte leuk.
Not much to say about it.	Net in hiele protte oer te sizzen.
When he died.	Doe't er stoar.
I think that's true for life.	Ik tink dat dat wier is foar it libben.
There was very little time to do anything.	Der wie hiel min tiid om wat te dwaan.
We do not know what will happen.	Wy witte net wat der barre sil.
Not such a thing, he would not.	Net sa'n ding, hy soe net.
All they have to say is that they are against it.	Alles wat se sizze moatte is dat se der tsjin binne.
One or both is good.	Ien of beide is goed.
It's good that something's going well.	It is goed dat der wat goed giet.
She must be afraid of you.	Se moat bang foar dy wêze.
We can do almost nothing.	Wy kinne hast neat dwaan.
Neither has said anything.	Gjin fan beide hat sein wat.
I have two other things for you.	Ik haw twa oare dingen foar dy.
For what time they had.	Foar hokker tiid se hiene.
I would not have let them have it.	Ik soe se it net hawwe litte.
I told him things, but not the truth.	Ik fertelde him dingen, mar net de wierheid.
We think it should.	Wy tinke dat it moat.
The work was like nothing we had ever seen before.	It wurk wie as neat dat wy ea earder sjoen hiene.
I just have to pay him.	Ik moat him gewoan betelje.
I'll show you in.	Ik sil dy sjen litte yn.
Did that work.	Hat dat wurke.
I heard her.	Ik hearde har.
He had been pretty nice, whatever he was wearing.	Hy hie aardich moai west, wat er ek oan hie.
In fact, it would have been better to wait.	Eins hie it better wachtsje moatten.
i am i.	ik bin ik.
And it's not just him that you want.	En it is net allinnich him dat jo wolle.
I could find my way back.	Ik koe de wei werom fine.
You can not do both.	Jo kinne net beide.
I wondered what had been said.	Ik frege my ôf wat der sein wie.
This was enough.	Dit wie genôch.
No one came up.	Gjinien kaam op.
That is what we needed.	Dat hiene wy ​​nedich.
I will keep my word.	Ik sil myn wurd hâlde.
They just come and go.	Se komme en gean gewoan.
Now tell me more.	No fertel my mear.
It's ready as soon as you are.	It is klear sa gau as jo binne.
Nothing ever goes as expected.	Neat giet oait as ferwachte.
I feel you.	Ik fiel dy.
But he could have so much more.	Mar hy koe safolle mear hawwe.
Life does not happen that way.	It libben bart net sa.
Please try again.	Noch in kear besykje.
All this can be from you.	Dit alles kin fan jo wêze.
It was so.	It wie sa.
They had no plan.	Se hiene gjin plan.
He wanted it.	Hy hie it wol.
It was still there.	It wie der noch.
Of course he would like it.	Fansels soe hy it leuk fine.
Of that animal.	Fan dat bist.
I wish there was more talk about it.	Ik woe dat der mear oer praat waard.
He liked her.	Hy mocht har graach.
He just told the truth.	Hy fertelde krekt de wierheid.
Please let me know if this is okay with you.	Lit my asjebleaft witte oft dit goed mei dy.
I'm not feeling too well today.	It giet my hjoed net al te goed.
You just become more yourself.	Jo wurde gewoan mear sels.
He was sitting there.	Hy siet dêr.
Do things wrong.	Dwaan dingen ferkeard.
I believe this was one of the first.	Ik leau dat dit ien fan 'e earste wie.
But he has been the same way.	Mar hy hat deselde manier west.
He does not seem sure of himself.	Hy liket net wis fan himsels.
He did not know what to say.	Hy wist net wat te sizzen.
Just give it to me.	Jou it my krekt.
And her life.	En har libben.
I asked him about a lot of people.	Ik frege him oer in protte minsken.
I can not hold it.	Ik kin it net hâlde.
In a way she never expected.	Op in manier dy't se noait ferwachte hie.
I did not want this to happen to my book.	Ik woe net dat dit mei myn boek bart.
But this is not about what they want.	Mar dit is net oer wat se wolle.
Well, one thing really.	No, ien ding echt.
I had nothing to do with it.	Ik hie der neat om.
It was not so long ago.	It wie net sa lang lyn.
Wherever you went.	Wêr't jo hinne wiene.
They do not go together.	Se geane net tegearre.
My life could have gone so differently.	Myn libben koe sa oars gean.
Let me try to finish this.	Lit my besykje dit ôf te meitsjen.
I knew her at once.	Ik koe har yn ien kear.
But the problem was still there.	Mar it probleem wie der noch.
She told you exactly what she had to do.	Se fertelde jo krekt wat se dwaan moast.
Look at those two people.	Sjoch dy twa minsken.
No one was for him.	Gjinien wie foar him.
So let's do this.	Dat litte wy dit dwaan.
Nobody knew about it.	Nimmen koe der fan witte.
He came here yesterday.	Hy kaam hjir juster.
So you made it.	Sa hawwe jo it makke.
I'm waiting for him to move on, and he does.	Ik wachtsje op him om troch te gean, en hy docht.
It was enough.	It wie genôch.
He just came back.	Hy kaam net werom.
We're doing well here.	Wy dogge it hjir goed.
This is what I once wanted.	Dit woe ik eartiids wol.
He will do nothing.	Hy sil neat dwaan.
It's one of my favorite things to do.	It is ien fan myn favorite dingen om te dwaan.
That's just not true.	Dat is gewoan net wier.
I love the book.	Ik hâld fan it boek.
Are you sure you want to do that?	Binne jo wis dat jo dat dwaan wolle?
It looks like.	It liket derop.
I could not do this.	Ik koe dit net dwaan.
Every day it just went on and on.	Alle dagen gie it mar troch.
Take the chance.	Nim de kâns.
I think you really need to stick with what you know.	Ik tink dat jo echt moatte bliuwe mei wat jo witte.
I would be very happy if you do.	Ik soe tige bliid wêze as jo dat dogge.
She just hoped he agreed with her plan.	Se hope mar dat er it iens wie mei har plan.
I did not work with him.	Ik wurke net mei him.
I just did not agree with it.	Ik wie it der gewoan net mei iens.
Of course, your home is yours.	Fansels is jo hûs fan jo.
It came with me.	It kaam mei my.
I'm with you.	Ik bin by dy.
It's hard to make money.	It is dreech om jild te meitsjen.
She had nothing to do with it.	Se hie der neat oan.
No one had heard anything.	Nimmen hie wat heard.
We need to be on him.	Wy moatte op him wêze.
Go girl.	Gean famke.
But the problem remained money.	Mar it probleem bleau jild.
She was wrong.	Se wie ferkeard.
She seems like she's talking to someone.	Se liket as praat se mei immen.
She must be with him now.	Se moat no by him wêze.
Give it to me then.	Jou it my dan.
Now she was sitting in front of it.	No siet se der foar.
This does not work.	Dit wurket net.
We were just happy to see her there.	Wy wiene gewoan bliid om har dêr te sjen.
I thought everything was so fun.	Ik tocht dat alles sa leuk wie.
Take it to her.	Nim it nei har.
He could not wait to get that.	Hy koe der net op wachtsje om dat hinne te kommen.
He did not know what.	Hy wist net wat.
I really wanted to go with him.	Ik woe echt mei him gean.
You just said it could happen again.	Jo hawwe krekt sein dat it kin barre wer.
One chance, maybe.	Ien kâns, miskien.
I was the only one.	Ik wie de ienige.
Pretty nice, don’t you think?	Moai moai, tinksto net?
He had hoped it would.	Hy hie hope dat it soe.
Anyone could do this.	Elkenien koe dit dwaan.
We did so many things together.	Wy diene safolle dingen tegearre.
You do it every day.	Jo dogge it alle dagen.
We do not know how we can help them.	Wy witte net hoe't wy se kinne helpe.
Maybe you can like me better.	Miskien kinne jo my der better fan hâlde.
Such a friend did just that.	Sa'n freon die krekt dat.
I know it did for me.	Ik wit dat it foar my dien hat.
Her friend entered the room.	Har freon kaam de keamer yn.
A door opened.	In doar gie iepen.
It will not be difficult.	It sil net dreech wêze.
It was not a big room.	It wie net in grutte keamer.
Tom looked around.	Tom seach om him hinne.
He handed the book to her.	Hy joech it boek oan har.
Your word is everything.	Jo wurd is alles.
Never to make it up.	Nea om it op te meitsjen.
Or if you have some concerns.	Of as jo wat soargen meitsje.
Who was it.	Wa wie it.
Still, nothing to worry about.	Noch, neat om te soargen oer.
I want to talk to him.	Ik wol mei him prate.
We have to do the work.	Wy moatte it wurk dwaan.
We can not be late for school.	Wy kinne net te let wêze op skoalle.
I said now.	sei ik no.
And then they stop.	En dan hâlde se op.
I do not know anymore.	Ik wit it net mear.
I'm sure there's more.	Ik bin der wis fan dat der mear is.
They can both go.	Se kinne beide gean.
We had no food, no water, and little hope.	Wy hiene gjin iten, gjin wetter, en in bytsje hope.
It was not good.	It wie net goed.
I feel bad for him.	Ik fiel my min foar him.
We are here to make it easy for you.	Wy binne hjir om it maklik foar jo te meitsjen.
It was tomorrow.	It wie moarn.
My name is not my name anymore.	Myn namme is myn namme net mear.
If we are.	As wy binne.
Both at work and at home.	Sawol op it wurk as thús.
Now he was up there.	No wie er der op.
We do know that he is something else.	Wy witte wol dat hy wat oars is.
You'll have it tomorrow.	Jo sille it moarn hawwe.
I'm coming to really, really get away.	Ik kom om echt echt fuort te kommen.
But we'll talk.	Mar wy sille prate.
They said a few.	Se seine in pear.
Just your money, and that's it.	Krekt dyn jild, en dat is it.
She's too old for this kind of work.	Se is te âld foar dit soarte fan wurk.
But this should give you an idea of ​​where we're in.	Mar dit moat jo in idee jaan oer wêr't wy yn binne.
She was just very tired.	Se wie gewoan hiel wurch.
Okay, let's do this.	Goed, litte wy dit dwaan.
I have to think we'll win this thing.	Ik moat tinke dat wy dit ding sille winne.
And we believe you do too.	En wy leauwe dat jo ek dogge.
That was only a few weeks ago.	Dat wie noch mar in pear wike lyn.
I've seen you before.	Ik haw dy earder sjoen.
That looked nice.	Dat seach der aardich út.
He needs to be home.	Hy moat thús wêze.
He's such a good man.	Hy is sa'n goede man.
It was just like me.	Dit wie sa net as my.
I was surprised about that.	Dêr wie ik ferrast oer.
Do not ask me how they did it.	Freegje my net hoe't se it dien hawwe.
In fact, he came to me.	Eins kaam er my ta.
So are many of my friends.	Sa binne in protte fan myn freonen.
It does not matter.	It makket neat út.
We will not do it if you are not ready.	Wy sille it net dwaan as jo net klear binne.
I thought she was just a girl.	Ik tocht dat se mar in famke wie.
I want it all, please.	Ik wol it allegear, asjebleaft.
But that would not be true.	Mar dat soe net wier wêze.
We need to make a plan here.	Wy moatte hjir in plan meitsje.
Do not be late.	Kom net te let.
I know she would love to take you there.	Ik wit se soe graach nimme dy dêr.
He sees something.	Hy sjocht wat.
It's so here.	It is hjir sa.
Do not think about it.	Tink der net oer nei.
Money is hard to find this year.	Jild is dit jier min te finen.
But we have to go.	Mar wy moatte gean.
I know exactly how she felt when you asked me for money.	Ik wit krekt hoe't se har fielde as jo my om jild freegje.
I think this will be another best for him.	Ik tink dat dit in oare bêste foar him sil wêze.
Now is your time to do one.	No is jo tiid om ien te dwaan.
Now he knew why.	No wist er wêrom.
Nothing was certain.	Neat wie wis.
I was his beast.	Ik wie syn bist.
Well then.	No dan.
We never really found out who he was.	Wy hawwe noait echt fûn wa't hy wie.
So often.	Sa faak.
But that's not the case anymore.	Mar sa is it net mear.
We do not have to see it again.	Wy hoege it net wer te sjen.
It did not matter.	It makke neat út.
Do it your way.	Doch it op jo manier.
He was not so sure.	Hy wie der net sa wis fan.
You live here all alone.	Jo wenje hjir hielendal allinnich.
But not a whole lot.	Mar net in hiele protte.
If you do this, you will get the same back.	As jo ​​​​dit dogge, krije jo itselde werom.
He was not afraid.	Hy wie net bang.
And wants to stay three hours.	En wol trije oeren bliuwe.
She felt she should take us at our word.	Se fielde dat se ús op ús wurd nimme moatte.
He had not told anyone.	Hy hie it oan nimmen ferteld.
I tried to get here.	Ik besocht hjir te kommen.
They are not children anymore.	It binne gjin bern mear.
Which was probably good.	Wat wierskynlik goed wie.
She did not seem surprised.	Se like net ferrast.
And in fact, that was also true of her.	En eins wie dat ek wier fan har.
People believe what they want.	Minsken leauwe wat se wolle.
I think she just did not know better.	Ik tink dat se gewoan net better wist.
That's the man you met yesterday.	Dat is de man dy't jo juster moete hawwe.
I'm the new girl.	Ik bin it nije famke.
And that does not happen.	En dat bart net.
It could.	It soe kinne.
I think we both get what we need.	Ik tink dat wy beide krije wat wy nedich binne.
He said he would come tomorrow.	Hy sei dat er moarn komme soe.
They are on him.	Se binne op him.
But first things first.	Mar earst dingen earst.
I thought of my family.	Ik tocht oan myn famylje.
I have not seen them.	Ik haw se net sjoen.
After hours was not much better.	Nei oeren wie net folle better.
You know how it goes.	Jo witte hoe't it giet.
Maybe we'm ready for that then.	Miskien binne wy ​​dêr dan klear foar.
He blamed the problems on his wife.	Hy joech de problemen op syn frou.
There must be a chance they will not get it.	Der moat in kâns wêze dat se it net krije.
They want what we want.	Se wolle wat wy wolle.
She never did it.	Se nea dat it.
It was never like that before.	It wie nea earder sa.
And not for the first time.	En net foar de earste kear.
He was soon free.	Hy wie gau frij.
I did not go.	Ik bin net gien.
Not my boy.	Net myn jonge.
I had a day off today.	Ik hie hjoed in dei frij.
You know who he is.	Jo witte wa't hy is.
Maybe for now.	Miskien foar no.
I want to be the guy.	Ik wol de keardel wêze.
It did not matter why.	It makke net út wêrom.
We had one first thing.	Wy hiene ien earste ding.
But he does not want me.	Mar hy wol my net.
This is something that makes them the best.	Dit is wat dat makket se de bêste.
It's everyone else here.	It is elkenien oars hjir.
Now it can be anyone.	No kin it elkenien wêze.
It's too much for me, this time of year.	It is my te folle, dizze tiid fan it jier.
People do that.	Minsken dogge dat.
This was not the way.	Dit wie net de manier.
What a following.	Wat in folgjende.
I think it might be about me.	Ik tink dat it oer my kin gean.
I was never worried about a thing.	Ik hie noait soargen oer in ding.
A teacher has been there.	In learaar hat der west.
Still everything went well.	Noch alles gie goed.
Now more needed than ever.	No mear nedich as ea.
Nothing comes out of that.	Dêr komt neat út.
It has been the talk of everyone since. 	It wie it praat fan elkenien sûnt. 
I hurt people.	Ik die minsken sear.
There is no way this can happen.	D'r is gjin manier dat dit barre kin.
You should not do that.	Dat moatte jo net dwaan.
You did not do things the right way.	Jo hawwe dingen net op 'e goede manier dien.
It was hard not to when his friend was around.	It wie dreech net doe't syn freon wie om.
Maybe started on an earlier.	Miskien begûn op in earder.
It's clear.	It is dúdlik.
She said she wanted to talk.	Se sei dat se prate woe.
But say the.	Mar se die.
He did what my friends did.	Hy die wat myn freonen diene.
You have to stay.	Jo moatte bliuwe.
All in all very nice.	Al mei al hiel moai.
I have no bad word to say about her.	Ik ha gjin min wurd oer har te sizzen.
But today you will get it.	Mar hjoed sille jo it krije.
Do not talk.	Net prate.
His father knew.	Syn heit wist.
He can do anything.	Hy kin alles dwaan.
I want to stay clear.	Ik wol dúdlik bliuwe.
He was no help.	Hy wie gjin help.
He is not as good as ever.	Hy is net sa goed as altyd.
Tomorrow would come.	Moarn soe komme.
There was a reason for that.	Dêr wie in reden foar.
This guy knew nothing.	Dizze keardel wist neat.
Keep the thing going.	Hâld it ding troch.
Maybe she's letting me stay in her room.	Miskien lit se my yn har keamer bliuwe.
You're just like your father.	Do bist krekt as dyn heit.
That will help.	Dat sil helpe.
My father did not see me.	Myn heit seach my net.
That girl is scared for her life.	Dat famke is bang foar har libben.
You can see that quite easily on film.	Dat kinne jo frij maklik op film sjen.
What day was it? 	Hokker dei wie it?
he would ask.	hy soe freegje.
That was good.	Dat wie goed.
They do this before they do anything else.	Dat dogge se foardat se wat oars dogge.
I did nothing wrong.	Ik die neat ferkeard.
I don 't even think she knows.	Ik tink net iens dat se it wit.
Same woman and same house.	Deselde frou en itselde hûs.
But that's what you think of it.	Mar dat is wat jo der fan fine.
That was the reason.	Dat wie de reden.
They say we should leave.	Se sizze dat wy fuort moatte.
He did not say much to me at all.	Hy hat hielendal net folle tsjin my sein.
Anyone can see that.	Elkenien kin dat sjen.
I really did not know who he really was.	Ik wist eins net wa't er wier wie.
This is your school.	Dit is dyn skoalle.
Maybe you know of me.	Miskien witte jo fan my.
You're too nice.	Do bist te aardich.
Long line, like.	Lang lyn, eins.
She nodded.	Se die der nei oan.
They need to do something about it.	Se moatte der wat oan dwaan.
It was the first time.	It wie de earste kear.
I think people will love it.	Ik tink dat minsken der fan sille hâlde.
No more questions!	Gjin fragen mear!
Maybe he's sick.	Miskien is er siik.
That's hard to disagree with.	Dat is dreech om it net iens mei.
Of course they can not.	Dat kinne se fansels net.
She knew of him.	Se wist fan him.
He wants a weekend at home.	Hy wol in wykein thús.
We have a job to do.	Wy hawwe in wurk te dwaan.
Actually, she seemed to like it.	Eins like se it leuk te hawwen.
One door in and out.	Ien doar yn en út.
I stayed to help her.	Ik bleau om har te helpen.
Of course I have to take care of it.	Ik moat der fansels foar soargje.
That was early in the week.	Dat wie betiid yn de wike.
This seemed to be more words than around the dog.	Dit like mear wurden te wêzen as om de hûn.
I do not know what will happen then.	Ik wit net wat der dan barre sil.
But there is no one else.	Mar der is gjinien oars.
But it seems to me more than that.	Mar it liket my mear as dat.
You just have not found them yet.	Jo hawwe se gewoan noch net fûn.
Of course, that would never happen.	Fansels soe dat noait barre.
Not good enough.	Net goed genôch.
She would not come.	Se soe net komme.
I believe you, man.	Ik leau dy, man.
He looked very different.	Hy seach der hiel oars út.
I really wish she was here.	Ik winskje echt dat se hjir wie.
Maybe it's something else.	Miskien is it wat oars.
We have friends.	Wy hawwe freonen.
You want none of this.	Jo wolle neat fan dit.
We just want to be there.	Wy wolle der allinnich mar wêze.
I know it will.	Ik wit dat it sil.
Still not working.	Noch altyd net wurket.
.	.
But nothing.	Mar neat.
It just happened there.	It barde der gewoan.
The man, of course, could not do much about it.	De man koe der fansels net folle oan dwaan.
And, there will be more.	En, der sil mear wêze.
As a boy he worked very hard at school.	As jonge wurke er tige hurd op skoalle.
I do not, of course.	Ik net, fansels.
But there had been one.	Mar der hie der ien west.
He thought he would make it.	Hy tocht dat er it meitsje soe.
And she actually looks very pretty.	En se sjocht der eins hiel moai út.
But they will not be there.	Mar se sille der net wêze.
And we did.	En wy diene.
Well, they were wrong.	No, se wiene ferkeard.
He saw some worries.	Hy seach wat soargen.
I think that's good.	Ik tink dat is goed.
We are very, very careful.	Wy binne hiel, hiel foarsichtich.
Do not go from house to house.	Gean net fan hûs ta hûs.
We need help.	Wy moatte helpe.
This year looks no different.	Dit jier liket net oars.
What were we talking about?	Wêr hiene wy ​​it oer?
She was his favorite.	Se wie syn favorite.
Please!.	Asjebleaft!.
From now on, it will take care of them itself.	Fan no ôf sil it sels foar har soargje.
Almost the same.	Hast itselde.
I did not tell her about his past.	Ik fertelde har net oer syn ferline.
But he was not alone.	Mar hy wie net allinnich.
There really are no words.	D'r binne wier gjin wurden.
We're actually doing something about it.	Wy dogge der eins wat oan.
We still had some work to do.	Wy hiene noch in wurk te dwaan.
Try a few today.	Besykje hjoed in pear.
He looked at her.	Hy seach har oan.
She had no plan now.	Se hie no gjin plan.
They love children.	Se hâlde fan bern.
Really nice work.	Echt moai wurk.
Now she had none of those things.	No hie se neat fan dy dingen.
Nobody said it was like that.	Nimmen sei dat it sa wie.
You will not see it.	Jo sille it net sjen.
A friend was with me.	In freon wie by my.
I hit it really hard.	Ik rekke der echt hiel hurd mei.
Well, almost everything.	No, hast alles.
Or so it seemed.	Of, sa seach it der út.
Record everything.	Nim alles op.
We need to be open to what comes into our lives.	Wy moatte iepen wêze foar wat yn ús libben komt.
She has been a great help around the office.	Se hat in grutte help west om it kantoar.
Once again how are you?	Noch ien kear hoe giet it mei dy.
He did not want to leave the house.	Hy woe it hûs net út.
That was to make you angry.	Dat wie om dy lilk te meitsjen.
But it worked well for me.	Mar it hat my goed wurke.
And it had worked.	En it hie wurke.
But we know what we know.	Mar wy witte wat wy witte.
We never get out of there.	Wy komme der noait út.
I really do not like this man.	Ik haw dizze man echt net leuk.
One more time, he thought.	Noch ien kear, tocht er.
This is a good one.	Dit is in goede ien.
He ran it.	Hy rûn it.
There is no problem with that at all.	D'r is hjir hielendal gjin probleem mei.
He wants to get on with things.	Hy wol oan de dingen gean.
She would get this right.	Se soe dit goed krije.
It becomes something.	It wurdt wat.
I really have no way of telling.	Ik haw echt gjin manier om te fertellen.
But he already knew it.	Mar hy wist it al.
Pass it on.	Jou it troch.
There will be.	Der sil wêze.
Look at me now.	Sjoch no nei my.
I'm not a person.	Ik bin gjin persoan.
But he could not yet.	Mar hy koe it noch net.
It does not look so pretty.	It sjocht der net sa moai út.
Was ready to leave.	Wie ree om fuort te gean.
Well, of course not for me.	No, fansels net foar my.
He seems to be against the idea.	Hy liket tsjin it idee te wêzen.
I can not tell you to do this.	Ik kin jo net sizze dit te dwaan.
On the same day it happened.	Op deselde dei barde it.
I really do not want to know.	Ik wol it eins net witte.
I had a very nice house.	Ik hie in hiel moai hûs.
Even memory.	Sels minne.
It's a place we've never been to before.	It is in plak dat wy noch noait west hawwe.
And some more on.	En wat mear op.
They’ve probably all heard it before.	Se hawwe it wierskynlik allegear earder heard.
It was not a job.	It wie gjin wurk.
That was just his way.	Dat wie krekt syn manier.
I have been working with her for a little over a year now.	Ik haw no in bytsje mear as in jier mei har wurke.
And they are the same.	En se binne itselde.
She lives in a nice house.	Se wennet yn in moai hûs.
We need to be together.	Wy moatte tegearre wêze.
You will come back for more.	Jo komme werom foar mear.
And they would need more.	En se soene mear nedich hawwe.
That just makes me run and run.	Dat makket my gewoan rûn en rûn.
This was so much better.	Dit wie safolle better.
In fact, it is none other than him.	Eins is it net ien oars as hy.
Not the whole thing.	Net it hiele ding.
They have other things to worry about.	Se hawwe oare dingen om har soargen oer te meitsjen.
These people want to talk to me.	Dizze minsken wolle mei my prate.
So does not hold.	Sa hâldt net.
We love the house.	Wy hâlde fan it hûs.
You can always get better.	Jo kinne altyd better wurde.
You do the same thing they did.	Jo dogge itselde wat se diene.
Things would never be as they had been.	Dingen soene noait sa wêze as se west hiene.
He will think.	Hy sil tinke.
He was very kind to us.	Hy wie hiel aardich foar ús.
Or so it would seem.	Of sa soe it lykje.
Are you okay now?	Binne jo no goed?
It's pretty clear why.	It is moai dúdlik wêrom.
I'm getting tired.	Ik wurd wurch.
For my kids, for everyone.	Foar myn bern, foar elkenien.
You have to go if you can.	Jo moatte gean as jo kinne.
He was not yet sure of that.	Dêr wie er noch net wis fan.
I'll work to find out.	Ik sil wurkje om dat út te finen.
I could not even say whether it was a boy or a girl.	Ik koe net iens sizze oft it in jonge of in famke wie.
He had long hair.	Hy hie lang hier.
I was hard.	Ik wie hurd.
She did not know it yet.	Se wist it noch net.
You should probably take care of that.	Dêr soene jo wierskynlik om soargje moatte.
In class.	Yn de klasse.
But we probably already know that.	Mar dat witte wy wierskynlik ek al.
There's really not much we can do.	D'r is eins net folle dat wy kinne dwaan.
They are not beautiful, exactly.	Se binne net moai, krekt.
He was the first thing she saw.	Hy wie it earste wat se seach.
We get it.	Wy krije it.
She was not ready for that yet.	Dêr wie se noch net klear foar.
I hope they did too.	Ik hoopje dat se ek dien hawwe.
You will be living here now.	Jo sille hjir no wenje.
I could not leave it.	Ik koe it net litte.
Your friends will all be there.	Jo freonen sille der allegear wêze.
Maybe not, 'she said.	Miskien net,' sei se.
It's just not here.	It is hjir gewoan net.
I first took in the baby.	Ik naam earst it bern yn.
I will do nothing.	Ik sil neat dwaan.
I'm doing very well.	It giet my hiel goed.
I just do not know with whom I should go otherwise.	Ik wit gewoan net by wa't ik oars moat.
Will never be with me.	Sil noait by my wêze.
But for them it was not.	Mar foar har wie it net.
Give her everything, she could play it.	Jou har alles, se koe it spylje.
In her room on the bed.	Yn har keamer op it bêd.
Only one way to find out.	Allinnich ien manier om út te finen.
But they find their way.	Mar se fine har wei.
We take to be.	Wy nimme te wêzen.
But this is where we go wrong.	Mar dit is wêr't wy ferkeard geane.
I do not want to live with you anymore.	Ik wol net mear by dy wenje.
Try these on for size.	Besykje dizze op foar grutte.
We will all be there.	Wy sille der allegear wêze.
Never take anything for granted.	Nim noait wat oan.
You have something out.	Jo hawwe wat út.
You can not do wrong.	Jo kinne gjin ferkeard dwaan.
But that does not matter.	Mar dat makket neat út.
Woman, the things you think of me.	Frou, de dingen dy't jo my tinke.
You got me exactly where you want me.	Jo hawwe my krekt wêr't jo my wolle.
Same as he was.	Itselde as hy wie.
That seems good.	Dat liket wol goed.
I never wanted you.	Ik woe dy noait.
Do not look angry.	Sjoch net lilk.
It comes from us.	It komt fan ús.
But they do not.	Mar dat dogge se net.
I hope she does.	Ik hoopje dat se dat docht.
She comes over a bit.	Se komt oer in bytsje.
Not for such a job.	Net foar sa'n baan.
You can not live there now.	Jo kinne dêr no net wenje.
I hope you do.	Ik hoopje dat jo dogge.
Give it a little now and then.	Jou it sa no en dan in bytsje.
There was no going back.	Der wie gjin wei werom.
But it was something to do.	Mar it wie wat te dwaan.
I think it is necessary.	Ik tink dat it nedich is.
It was nothing to her.	It wie har neat.
You live here.	Jo wenje hjir.
It never suited me well.	It siet my noait goed.
This works very well.	Dit wurket heul hast.
That's for sure.	Dat is wis.
I knew it was him.	Ik wist dat it him wie.
They are both good people.	It binne beide goede minsken.
They come from money, he does not.	Se komme fan jild, hy net.
We had everything ready to go.	Wy hiene alles klear om te gean.
A lot of it true.	In protte fan it wier.
I could be anyone.	Ik koe elkenien wêze.
Give the money back.	Jou it jild werom.
I do not see how that can be.	Ik sjoch net hoe't dat kin.
It's all still here.	It is hjir allegear noch.
He could hardly believe it.	Hy koe it hast net leauwe.
I believe there is a better way.	Ik leau dat d'r in bettere manier is.
And that was hard enough.	En dat wie dreech genôch.
My dad was a it now.	Myn heit wie no in it.
The photo looks like us!	De foto liket ús!
And you have to.	En jo moatte.
He never showed anyone.	Hy liet nea immen sjen.
Never so much water.	Nea safolle wetter.
We know what it's like.	Wy witte hoe't it is.
I made friends do it.	Ik makke freonen dwaan it.
There's someone talking.	Der is ien oan it praten.
Let's hope so.	Litte wy dat hoopje.
A few of us.	In pear fan ús.
I feel with the people there.	Ik fiel mei de minsken dêr.
It would not be a few days.	It soe net in pear dagen wêze.
He looked around the room.	Hy seach de keamer om.
Do not you think we need this?	Tinksto net dat wy dit nedich binne?
The man had seen them but did not try to stop them.	De man hie se sjoen, mar besocht se net tsjin te hâlden.
In the same room itself.	Yn deselde keamer sels.
And we were tired.	En wy wiene wurch.
You're fine.	Do bist goed.
She no longer wanted to be alone in the big bed.	Se hie der net mear oan om allinnich yn it grutte bêd te wêzen.
But then there are other things.	Mar dan binne der oare dingen.
There is nothing to do.	Der is neat oan te dwaan.
I work it out for myself.	Ik wurkje it foar my.
He knows it too.	Hy wit it ek.
Try this out for size.	Besykje dit út foar grutte.
You can not do it before or after that.	Jo kinne it net foar of nei dat dwaan.
We never did.	Wy hawwe nea dien.
He told us himself.	Hy fertelde ús sels.
He did it on his own, no one told him.	Hy die dat op himsels, gjinien hat him sein.
We hope you are too !.	Wy hoopje dat jo ek binne!.
I'm not sure if that's what you need.	Ik bin der net wis fan oft dat is wat jo nedich hawwe.
But he did not want to talk to anyone much.	Mar hy woe net folle mei immen prate.
I feel good.	Ik fiel my goed.
We have a lot to talk about.	Wy hawwe in protte om oer te praten.
I see it in him every day.	Ik sjoch it alle dagen yn him.
I just found that my kids do better with you early on.	Ik haw krekt fûn dat myn bern it betiid better dogge mei dy.
They knew, too.	Se wisten ek.
You have decided that enough is enough.	Jo hawwe besletten dat genôch is genôch.
I wondered what else they wanted.	Ik frege my ôf wat se oars wolle.
Now there was nothing left to see.	No wie der neat mear te sjen.
You know what that would be.	Jo witte wat dat soe wêze.
He walked away.	Hy gie fuort.
So he never really told us anything.	Sa hat er ús noait echt wat ferteld.
And he had done it.	En hy hie it dien.
I've met that before.	Dat haw ik earder moete.
She now knew what was going to happen.	Se wist no wat der barre soe.
My wife made everything.	Myn frou makke alles.
Not only this.	Net allinnich dizze.
I have to buy one.	Ik moat ien keapje.
Everyone is talking about it.	Elkenien praat der oer.
I can play it now.	Ik kin it no spylje.
He has something.	Hy hat wat.
You're old enough to be his mother.	Do bist âld genôch om syn mem te wêzen.
There was not much money left in it.	Der bleau net folle jild yn.
Who had it.	Wa hie it.
It just kept going through and through.	It bleau gewoan troch en troch.
If that is the only hope, there is no hope.	As dat de ienige hope is, is d'r gjin hope.
And it does not look like that will happen.	En it liket der net op dat dat barre sil.
Well, what that thing I am.	No, wat dat ding ek is.
I want to say it was our time.	Ik wol sizze dat it ús tiid wie.
It's been really nice.	It is echt moai west.
Try to get back to our lives.	Besykje werom te kommen nei ús libben.
It will go against much of what you are told.	It sil tsjin in protte fan wat jo ferteld binne.
One bit at a time.	Ien bytsje op in tiid.
This is me in good.	Dit is ek in goede.
Here, let me.	Hjir, lit my.
Do not do it.	Doch it net.
If only her words were true.	As har wurden mar wier wiene.
He has not been seen for a long time.	Hy is lang net sjoen.
he asked.	hy frege.
Rather, it seems to come to us of course.	Earder liket it ús fansels te kommen.
So many people could and did not.	Safolle minsken koene en diene net.
On his words.	Op syn wurden.
But there was more to it.	Mar der wie mear oan it.
There is no way around that.	Dêr is gjin wei om.
But it's something.	Mar it is wat.
I asked him what place it was.	Ik frege him hokker plak it wie.
But even see these thoughts for what they are.	Mar sjoch sels dizze gedachten foar wat se binne.
But it is not so.	Mar it is net sa.
But it must.	Mar it moat.
I'm tired of being the only one.	Ik bin wurch fan de ienige te wêzen.
It seemed to come from more than one person.	It like fan mear as ien persoan te kommen.
He did not think he could wait much longer.	Hy tocht net dat er folle mear wachtsje koe.
She never said anything.	Se hat noait wat sein.
I did everything that was expected of me.	Ik die alles wat fan my ferwachte waard.
But not only that.	Mar net allinnich dat.
It is not necessary to take their lives.	It is net nedich om har libben te nimmen.
We want to do it right.	Wy wolle it goed dwaan.
So, let's agree not to agree on many things.	Dat, litte wy it iens wurde om net oer in protte dingen iens te wurden.
I was such a girl.	Ik wie sa'n famke.
She has a family.	Se hat in famylje.
You can not say who people are.	Jo kinne net sizze wa't minsken binne.
I do not want any of that.	Dêr wol ik neat fan.
This should not happen.	Dit moat net barre.
But this water.	Mar dit wetter.
He's doing it right.	Hy docht it goed.
Either way, must go.	Hoe dan ek, moat gean.
Life is not against you.	It libben is net tsjin dy.
Nothing at all!.	Neat!.
Show it to me!	Lit it my sjen!
It's so you.	It is sa dy.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
He loves that book.	Hy hâlde fan dat boek.
I'm sure of that.	Ik ha der wis fan makke.
We've had this before.	Wy hawwe dit al earder hân.
For one thing, it really does matter how much you make.	Foar ien ding, it makket echt út hoefolle jo meitsje.
That would never happen today, he told me.	Dat soe hjoed noait barre, sei er tsjin my.
I never even thought about these two together.	Ik haw noait iens tocht oer dizze twa tegearre.
I will ask her then.	Ik sil har dan freegje.
Take a good look at the thing.	Sjoch goed nei it ding.
That was probably the best time of my life.	Dat wie nei alle gedachten de bêste tiid fan myn libben.
You can do that here.	Dat kinne jo hjir dwaan.
They clearly like it.	Se hâlde der dúdlik fan.
We will not be sure until we do.	Wy sille net wis wêze oant wy dat dogge.
They want to be together.	Se wolle tegearre wêze.
It has a lot of hair on it.	It hat in protte hier op.
And now they will try to get me back.	En no sille se besykje om my werom te kommen.
We're been in the house ever since.	Wy binne sûnt dy tiid yn 'e hûs.
They are a little late with this.	Se binne in bytsje let mei dit.
He does not do much now.	Hy docht no net folle.
But they should not know that.	Mar dat moatte se net witte.
He has to stop that, otherwise something would happen.	Hy moat dat ophâlde, oars soe der wat barre.
Probably he's her husband.	Wierskynlik is hy har man.
Those people don’t get jobs that often.	Dy minsken krije net sa faak wurk.
You're a family man.	Do bist in famylje man.
It's really true.	It is echt wier.
That can not really be there.	Dat kin der eins net wêze.
So let's talk about you.	Dat litte wy it oer dy hawwe.
Everyone has to play this.	Elkenien moat dit spylje.
He said well.	Hy sei goed.
This is not about me.	Dit giet net oer my.
Her father was scared, but her mother was angry.	Har heit wie bang, mar har mem wie lilk.
Can't tell anyone what she saw.	Kin gjinien fertelle wat se sjoen hie.
When are we leaving? 	Wannear geane wy ​​fuort?
But that's not what it's about now.	Mar dêr giet it no net om.
I was not really sure what to do.	Ik wie der net echt wis fan wat te dwaan.
I soon found out why.	Ik fûn gau út wêrom.
I'm the last one standing.	Ik bin de lêste dy't stiet.
He loves both.	Hy hâlde fan beide.
I feel like it's looking at me.	Ik fiel dat it nei my sjocht.
I will never do this to my children.	Ik sil dit noait oan myn bern dwaan.
I had to talk to him.	Ik moast mei him prate.
I thought it would be nice to see.	Ik tocht dat it wol aardich wie om te sjen.
He never told his parents.	Hy hat syn âlden noait ferteld.
In a few years we would not be there anymore.	Oer in pear jier soene wy ​​der net mear wêze.
He's on my way.	Hy is op myn wei.
But let's give it a try.	Mar litte wy it in kâns jaan.
Not for your teacher.	Net foar jo learaar.
The party is tomorrow.	It feest is moarn.
But not for me.	Mar net foar my.
It lets you do things.	It lit jo dingen dwaan.
But we could not speak, so we both knew well.	Mar wy koene net prate, dat wisten wy beide goed.
I sat on my bed.	Ik siet op myn bêd.
He loves me.	Hy hâldt fan my.
That woman, she said.	Dy frou, sei se.
We first met at a party in his house.	Wy moete earst op in feest yn syn hûs.
It's probably nothing.	It is wierskynlik neat.
And now her mother is gone.	En no is har mem fuort.
He knew me well too.	Hy koe my ek goed.
He did not know.	Hy wist it net.
That I could do.	Dat soe ik kinne kinne.
That's all we can do.	Dat is alles wat wy kinne dwaan.
I want to see my husband.	Ik wol myn man sjen.
Do it quickly, friend.	Doch it gau, freon.
Was not one here as we are here.	Wie hjir net ien as wy hjir.
I was just glad we were friends.	Ik wie gewoan bliid dat wy freonen wiene.
I scared you.	Ik makke dy bang.
I think you will like it too.	Ik tink dat jo it ek leuk fine.
That's what he wanted.	Dat woe er wol.
He just wants the best for me.	Hy wol gewoan it bêste foar my.
He was not like that anymore.	Hy wie sa net mear.
That was a fun thing to do in the movie.	Dat wie in leuk ding om te dwaan yn 'e film.
That he's not talking to anyone like that.	Dat er sa mei gjinien prate mei.
I am sorry.	It spyt my.
But she was not yet ready to tell him where she had been.	Mar se wie noch net ree om him te fertellen wêr't se west hie.
I like to keep it up.	Ik hâld it graach oan.
It's just the right thing to do.	It is krekt it goede ding om te dwaan.
So they are not the same.	Sa binne se net itselde.
Well, we'll see.	No, wy sille sjen.
You do not even have to talk to him.	Jo hoege net iens mei him te praten.
How do you know what the dog will do.	Hoe witte jo wat de hûn sil dwaan.
I wanted to be liked by everyone.	Ik woe troch elkenien leuk wurde.
Not about happy.	Net oer bliid.
Let us not worry about being late.	Lit ús gjin soargen meitsje oer te let.
Maybe they know something.	Miskien witte se wat.
I was surprised.	Ik waard ferrast.
Not the new one.	Net de nije.
Go to work.	Nei it wurk gean.
I'm late for work last night.	Ik bin fannacht let oan it wurk.
Really.	Echt.
But it was not good enough.	Mar it wie net goed genôch.
Of course she knows it.	Fansels wit se it.
I don't know.	Ik wit it net.
I would not do this otherwise.	Ik soe dit oars net dwaan.
I did not do well in school.	Ik die it net goed op skoalle.
Maybe no one can help you.	Miskien kin nimmen dy helpe.
He was talking to me.	Hy wie tsjin my oan it praten.
Not your husband.	Net dyn man.
Everyone in town knows us.	Elkenien yn 'e stêd ken ús.
No one heard from her again.	Nimmen hearde wer fan har.
And it seemed to go up again.	En it like der wer op te gean.
I'll talk to him.	Ik sil mei him prate.
But you're coming back.	Mar jo komme werom.
It must be.	It moat wêze.
If he does not know, he does not.	As er it net wit, docht er it net.
What is the name of the school?	Wat is de namme fan 'e skoalle?
I did not think of her, he said.	Ik tocht net oan har, sei er.
Visit here.	Besykje hjir.
But now she was gone, and there was nothing left.	Mar no wie se fuort, en der wie neat mear oer.
I do not think he will return until tomorrow.	Ik tink net dat er oant moarn werom komt.
For us to go.	Foar ús om te gean.
Very, very old.	Hiel, hiel âld.
We do not want this.	Wy wolle dit net.
We did nothing to him.	Wy hawwe him neat dien.
For the day.	Foar de dei.
Not in this house he does not.	Net yn dit hûs docht er net.
I did not say he could.	Ik sei net dat hy koe.
So they can hope.	Sa kinne se hoopje.
Look for the woman.	Sjoch foar de frou.
Well, let me tell you that then.	No, lit my it dy dan fertelle.
But he had heard what was happening.	Mar hy hie heard wat der barde.
I always had something to tell her.	Ik hie har altyd wat te fertellen.
Long before you go, you've decided what to do with me.	Lang foardat jo geane, hawwe jo besletten wat jo mei my dwaan moatte.
And mom talks to dad today.	En mem praat hjoed mei heit.
We must always be careful.	Wy moatte altyd foarsichtich wêze.
Maybe that's why it's so difficult.	Miskien is dat de reden dat it sa dreech is.
Just make them up.	Meitsje jo se gewoan op.
It was good to have a car again.	It wie goed om wer in auto te hawwen.
I love the people who work there.	Ik hâld fan de minsken dy't dêr wurkje.
I love this movie so much.	Ik hâld sa folle fan dizze film.
To help you create.	Om jo te helpen meitsje.
It happens quite often.	It bart frij faak.
It was a real home from home.	It wie in echt thús fan hûs.
We are not the police.	Wy binne net de plysje.
But that is then.	Mar dat is dan.
Do not talk to her.	Praat net mei har.
There they will wait.	Dêr sille se wachtsje.
I can not get this to work.	Ik kin dit net oan it wurk krije.
We are not yet sure what will happen to us.	Wy binne noch net wis wat der mei ús barre sil.
The other two did better.	De oare twa diene it better.
And in my life.	En yn myn libben.
You can not wait.	Jo kinne net wachtsje.
This is a very common problem.	Dit is in hiel gewoan probleem.
Talk to him a little and go to the room.	Praat in bytsje mei him en gean nei de keamer.
You have to do everything.	Jo moatte alles dwaan.
I know how to do it.	Ik wit hoe te dwaan it.
That's his plan.	Dat is syn plan.
He told me a lot.	Hy hat my in protte ferteld.
This will not hurt.	Dit sil gjin sear dwaan.
I had never lived around children.	Ik hie nea wenne om bern.
Even through and through.	Sels troch en troch.
The police, man.	De plysje, man.
Or to drive you.	Of om dy te riden.
It was something that did not happen.	It wie wat dat net barde.
I will not.	Ik sil net.
And they must take it from him.	En se moatte it fan him nimme.
Not that it makes much sense.	Net dat it in protte makket.
You know what needs to be done.	Jo witte wat der dien wurde moat.
Well, well, well !.	Wol, wol, wol!.
They have a family.	Se hawwe in famylje.
I had never read it before.	Ik hie it noch noait earder lêzen.
But it's late.	Mar it is let.
I do not know how we do it.	Ik wit net hoe't wy it dogge.
We've just not been here that long.	Wy binne hjir gewoan net sa lang west.
This is different.	Dit is oars.
You have to work with me.	Jo moatte mei my wurkje.
Are you sure this is the right way to go?	Binne jo wis dat dit de goede wei is?
He said it to me one evening at dinner.	Hy sei it tsjin my op in jûn by it iten.
She is in all of us.	Se is yn ús allegear.
I had been to her house.	Ik hie by har hûs west.
Everything has to be in place and now it is so.	Alles moat op syn plak en no is it sa.
He had only been home a few days.	Hy hie mar in pear dagen thús west.
You will need it.	Jo sille it nedich hawwe.
And maybe then we would not hurt so much.	En miskien soene wy ​​dan net safolle sear dwaan.
They will not be who you think they are.	Se sille net wêze wa't jo tinke.
I do not believe him.	Ik leau him net.
If not for her, he would be you.	As net foar har, soe hy jo wêze.
We have no worries about this.	Wy hawwe gjin soargen oer dit.
I think they can.	Ik tink dat se kinne.
And no one knows where he is.	En nimmen wit wêr't er is.
If they have, ask how many.	As se hawwe, freegje hoefolle.
In the best way of course.	Op de bêste manier fansels.
Of course, people want work and food.	Fansels wolle minsken wurk en iten.
They would not tell me anything about it.	Se soene my der neat oer fertelle.
There was nothing left for him.	Der wie neat mear foar him.
They were not only there to look after him.	Se wiene der net allinnich om nei him te sjen.
He's getting old.	Hy wurdt âld.
But lately, the people have come.	Mar de lêste tiid binne de minsken kommen.
We can do both.	Wy kinne beide dwaan.
That was never good.	Dat wie noait goed.
I think people should try it.	Ik tink dat minsken it moatte besykje.
He seems to be having a hard time.	Hy liket it dreech te hawwen.
They do not look scared.	Se lykje net bang.
It's about chance.	It giet om kâns.
Exactly, what are you doing to me.	Krekt, wat dogge jo my.
They must like it.	Se moatte it leuk fine.
I'll be back .	Ik kom werom .
What you thought it was.	Wat jo tocht dat it wie.
We have to go!	Wy moatte fuort!
He does not look well.	Hy sjocht der net goed út.
A good wife.	In goede frou.
Why did he have to come?	Wêrom moast er komme?
Is she talking about me? 	Hat se it oer my?
They were scared.	Se wiene bang.
A movie has been made about it.	Der is in film oer makke.
This will help a lot.	Dit sil tige helpe.
Even a year ago, an hour or two was not difficult.	Sels in jier lyn wie in oere as twa net dreech.
We did not know better.	Wy wisten net better.
It's never too late to be what you may have been.	It is noait te let om te wêzen wat jo miskien west hawwe.
Tried everything she could.	Besocht alles wat se koe.
But she does not look so good.	Mar se sjocht der net sa goed út.
Then he does not have to watch the movie.	Dan hoecht er de film net te sjen.
That's just the job.	Dat is gewoan it wurk.
It goes against everything.	It giet tsjin alles yn.
We try not to take anything away from anyone.	Wy besykje neat fan immen ôf te nimmen.
I'm not stopping there.	Ik hâld der net op.
They should be here in a few hours.	Se moatte hjir oer in pear oeren wêze.
I have always been such a person.	Ik bin altyd sa'n persoan west.
And everything will get better.	En alles sil better wurde.
It does not matter now.	It makket no neat út.
If you have the time of course.	As jo ​​de tiid hawwe fansels.
Or they knew something we did not know.	Of se wisten wat dat wy net wisten.
That may be true.	Dat kin wier wêze.
They like to take it to us.	Se wolle it ús graach nimme.
But no one seemed to tell me.	Mar nimmen like it my te fertellen.
Do not talk to them much about it.	Praat der net folle mei har oer.
So was it me.	Sa wie dit ek.
You have to try to make it happen.	Jo moatte besykje om it barre te meitsjen.
We need to find another way.	Wy moatte in oare manier fine.
And tell everyone what to do and how to do it.	En fertel elkenien wat te dwaan en hoe te dwaan.
You do not have much time.	Jo hawwe net folle tiid.
He ate it quickly.	Hy iet it gau op.
I will not look back.	Ik sil net werom sjen.
Just remove it.	Meitsje it gewoan fuort.
To make me angry.	Om my lilk te meitsjen.
It would be so easy to get away from that idea.	It soe sa maklik wêze om fan dat idee ôf te gean.
We're not really talking.	Wy prate net echt.
Sawol ea.	Sawol ea.
It's my idea.	It is myn idee.
We just like it.	Wy fine it gewoan goed.
Either way, it's up to you, if you will.	Hoe dan ek, it is fan jo, as jo it wolle.
The girl is a bad girl.	It famke is in min famke.
It was nothing.	It wie neat.
You are happy with him.	Jo binne bliid mei him.
I never knew that.	Dat wist ik noait.
If you love movies, you must love this movie.	As jo ​​​​fan film meitsje, moatte jo fan dizze film hâlde.
It's a first.	It is in earste.
He was just different.	Hy wie gewoan oars.
Please do what you can.	Doch asjebleaft wat jo kinne.
Get out of there.	Dêr fuort.
Could that be true ?.	Kin dat wier wêze?.
Just as good, really.	Krekt sa goed, echt.
And everything else you want to see.	En al it oare dat jo sjen wolle.
I'm not a father.	Ik bin gjin heit.
What happened can happen again.	Wat der bard is kin wer barre.
Tell us that.	Fertel ús dat.
My friend had enough money this time.	Myn freon hie genôch jild dizze kear.
And we would love to stay in that place.	En wy wolle graach op dat plak bliuwe.
No one knew what to say.	Net ien wist wat te sizzen.
And came.	En kaam.
That was his name.	Dat wie syn namme.
They will come out of your way.	Se sille út jo wei komme.
That's what he says.	Dat seit er.
We're not going there.	Dêr geane wy ​​net hinne.
But what he wanted was something more.	Mar wat er woe wie wat mear.
I'm really not a city person.	Ik bin echt gjin stêd persoan.
She felt she could say anything.	Se fielde dat se alles sizze koe.
There's no one he can tell you about here.	D'r is gjinien dy't hy hjir oer fertelle kin.
If it is difficult, you can do something else.	As it dreech is, kinne jo wat oars dwaan.
You'll tell me.	Jo sille it my fertelle.
It does not suit him now.	It sit him no net.
That man can work.	Dy man kin wurkje.
But really.	Mar echt.
I just could not take it anymore.	Ik koe it gewoan net mear oan.
Let me just say that we have two thoughts.	Dat lit my mar sizze dat wy twa gedachten hawwe.
When do we eat?	Wannear ite wy?
It's one.	It is ien.
He just came.	Hy kaam net.
You are not.	Do bist it net.
But it's actually like holding.	Mar it is eins as hâlden.
I would do it.	Ik soe it dwaan.
It's hard to keep a job.	It is dreech om in baan te hâlden.
She told you what to do.	Se fertelde jo wat te dwaan.
Let's hope for the best.	Litte wy hoopje op it bêste.
But she always knew.	Mar se wist it altyd.
He for her.	Hy foar har.
He has that.	Dat hat er.
Today makes three days too late.	Hjoed makket trije dagen te let.
I love this house.	Ik hâld fan dit hûs.
Still early or late.	Noch betiid noch let.
I'm not here to hurt you.	Ik bin hjir net om dy sear te dwaan.
He's still doing it.	Hy docht it noch.
I'm so sorry I hurt you.	It spyt my tige dat ik dy sear dien haw.
I do not know how to tell.	Ik wit net hoe't ik it fertelle moat.
I love it so much.	Ik hâld der safolle fan.
Or many other things.	Of in protte oare dingen.
I could not afford a new car.	Ik koe gjin nije auto betelje.
There are things we can do now that can help.	D'r binne dingen dy't wy no kinne dwaan dy't kinne helpe.
The more you do this, the better you get at it.	Hoe mear jo dit dogge, hoe better jo it krije.
I need it now.	Ik haw it no nedich.
The man went to his house.	De man gie nei syn hûs.
I looked at her.	Ik seach har oan.
I do not think anyone should.	Ik tink net dat immen moat.
That must remain so.	Dat moat sa bliuwe.
He put all the food away.	Hy sette al it iten fuort.
That is not the right way.	Dat is net de goede wei.
I did not feel that way.	Ik fielde it net sa.
Everything is fine, really.	Alles is goed, echt.
I never had a boyfriend.	Ik hie noait in freon.
This has been mine.	Dit hat fan my west.
Here is nothing for me.	Hjir is neat foar my.
We can do that here too.	Dat kinne wy ​​hjir ek.
We did the right thing.	Wy diene it goede ding.
The best thing that ever happened to him was when she walked away.	It bêste dat him ea bard wie, wie doe't se fuort rûn.
They work well and they work well.	Se wurkje goed en se wurkje goed.
Give it plenty of time.	Jou it in protte tiid.
I just did not want to hurt her.	Ik woe har gewoan net sear sjen.
This happens to everyone.	Dit bart mei elkenien.
Of course there was.	Fansels wie der.
I do not have it.	Ik haw it net.
He could not quite believe it.	Hy koe it net hielendal leauwe.
And I.	En ik.
They love their children.	Se hâlde fan har bern.
I'm fine with that.	Ik bin der goed mei.
I also never got it.	Ik haw ek noait krigen.
But it was not the first time.	Mar it wie net de earste kear.
It could have been very different.	It koe hiel oars.
In and out, in and out.	Yn en út, yn en út.
And that's what you need to do.	En dat is wat jo moatte dwaan.
My mother had one.	Myn mem hie ien.
I look forward to seeing you again.	Ik sjoch der nei út om dy wer te sjen.
And one more, and so on forever.	En noch ien, en sa foar altyd.
I'm glad that's what happened.	Ik bin bliid dat wat der bard is.
Not everyone has those things either.	Net elkenien hat dy dingen ek.
It is the following.	It is it folgjende.
But that's the net.	Mar dat die se net.
This worked on the first time.	Dit wurke op de earste kear.
They have nothing.	Se hawwe neat.
Maybe it's just both.	Miskien is it gewoan beide.
I do not want to leave.	Ik wol net fuort.
He was very happy to become one.	Hy wie tige bliid om ien te wurden.
Actually never on time.	Eins nea op tiid.
We need everyone to come with us.	Wy hawwe elkenien nedich om mei ús te kommen.
It has happened twice.	It is twa kear bard.
So she was not at all.	Sa wie se hielendal net.
I'm the one who loves it.	Ik bin dejinge dy't der fan hâldt.
They look so real.	Se lykje sa echt.
I just do not want them to get sick.	Ik wol gewoan net dat se siik wurde.
You're going home soon.	Jo geane gau nei hûs.
She walks away.	Se giet fuort.
But you do not know it and will not do it.	Mar jo witte it net en sille it net dwaan.
I must have been easy to get over.	Ik moat maklik west hawwe om oer te kommen.
My boy.	Myn jonge.
I think that.	Ik tink dat.
She was very beautiful.	Se wie tige moai.
I've had enough.	Ik haw genôch hân.
She looked at her husband.	Se seach nei har man.
He said it was better not to.	Hy sei dat it better net wie.
But this will be fine.	Mar dit sil goed wêze.
That will take some time.	Dat sil in bytsje tiid nimme.
There's some truth in that.	Dêr sit wat wierheid yn.
He had one more hand in her hair.	Hy hie noch ien hân yn har hier.
Still.	Noch.
You are my good friend.	Do bist myn goede freon.
I'm really for him.	Ik bin echt foar him.
He thought we were friends.	Hy tocht dat wy freonen wiene.
It's going well with us.	It giet goed mei ús.
You should be too.	Jo moatte ek wêze.
He does, and there he is for sure.	Hy docht, en d'r is wis.
You have been in one and you have all been in.	Jo hawwe yn ien west en jo hawwe allegear yn west.
They are what they are and will remain.	Se binne wat se binne en sille bliuwe.
He never told me.	Hy hat my noait ferteld.
I never did it.	Ik haw it noait dien.
I'll keep it to myself if it's a boy.	Ik sil it sels hâlde as it in jonge is.
I agree with everything everyone has said.	Ik bin it iens mei alles dat elkenien sein hat.
He may want it himself, but he does not talk about it.	Hy kin it sels wol, mar hy praat der net oer.
I wish he could help me.	Ik winskje dat hy my koe helpe.
How long ago that had been.	Hoe lang lyn wie dat west.
No one had been afraid of me before.	Nimmen wie earder bang foar my west.
Then you will go.	Dan sille jo gean.
she said again.	sei se wer.
Well, not anymore.	No, net mear.
They could work the money too.	Se koene it jild ek wurkje.
Man is he nice.	Man is hy aardich.
There are no other people around.	D'r binne gjin oare minsken om.
You got me there.	Do hast my dêr.
That was enough.	Dat wie genôch.
It's out in my car.	It is út yn myn auto.
But they did not get it.	Mar se krigen it net.
You're sick, she said.	Do bist siik, sei se.
But my husband was gone.	Mar myn man wie fuort.
At your door.	By jo doar.
They do not tell you that.	Dat fertelle se dy net.
This is your last chance, my boy.	Dit is dyn lêste kâns, myn jonge.
And work hard at it.	En wurkje dêr goed oan.
If he the.	As hy die.
She walked into her room.	Se rûn har keamer yn.
That I can try.	Dat kin ik besykje.
He comes here very often, to talk about them.	Hy komt hjir hiel faak, om oer har te praten.
I don't mind.	Makket my net út.
She used to do that for him when she wanted something.	Dat die se eartiids foar him as se wat woe.
She had made him herself.	Se hie him sels makke.
That's the problem here.	Dat is it probleem hjir.
She says she will not.	Se seit dat se net sil.
I was so scared that someone would come.	Ik wie sa bang dat der ien komme soe.
That's your reason !.	Dat is dyn reden!.
I did not feel that way.	Ik fielde my net sa.
There is no one there.	Der is gjinien dêr.
This is how he looks to me.	Sa sjocht er der foar my út.
It felt like she was, but maybe not.	It fielde as wie se, mar miskien net.
Happy weekend.	Goed wykein.
I have to do this.	Ik moat dit dwaan.
I have enough.	Ik haw genôch.
I knew them.	Ik koe se.
She went too hard.	Se gie te hurd.
There was no way for me to be sure.	D'r wie gjin manier foar my om wis te wêzen.
I could never do anything good.	Ik koe noait wat goed dwaan.
That was three years ago.	Dat wie trije jier lyn.
Hold up.	Ophâlde.
You've done enough, and you need to go to her house.	Jo hawwe genôch dien, en jo moatte nei har thús gean.
I think she's happy.	Ik tink dat se bliid is.
I'm giving the money back.	Ik jou it jild werom.
My whole life was down there, it seems.	Myn hiele libben wie der ûnder, liket.
They would have nothing to come back to.	Se soene neat hawwe om werom te kommen.
I was ready.	Ik wie klear.
Of course it happened to everyone, but so too.	Fansels barde it mei elkenien, mar ek sa.
People say things about my family.	Minsken sizze dingen oer myn famylje.
Or maybe he's just what he likes.	Of miskien is hy krekt wat hy liket.
About and about.	Om en om.
I had his mother.	Ik hie syn mem.
He found a boy who would talk about it.	Hy fûn in jonge dy't der oer prate soe.
Just be careful with them.	Wês gewoan foarsichtich mei har.
We will find them.	Wy sille se fine.
I just did not want to try anymore.	Ik woe gewoan net mear besykje.
I just have to believe it.	Ik moat it mar leauwe.
You're home soon.	Do bist gau thús.
It will do the same for you.	It sil dwaan itselde foar dy.
You will say that it is difficult to do.	Jo sille sizze dat it dreech te dwaan is.
She did not seem to have seen us.	Se like ús net sjoen te hawwen.
And that's exactly what happened.	En dat is krekt wat bard.
He got what people get when they do.	Hy krige wat minsken krije as se dat dogge.
I would go to the moon.	Ik soe nei de moanne gean.
So he took the girl to his house.	Dat hy naam it famke nei syn hûs.
It was so hard.	It wie sa dreech.
She felt he was hers.	Se fielde dat er fan har wie.
That you could see.	Dat koene jo sjen.
I'm sorry for you.	It spyt my foar dy.
Everything in place.	Alles op syn plak.
I worked a lot.	Ik wurke in protte.
And this time was no different.	En dizze kear wie net oars.
That's not a big question.	Dat is gjin grutte fraach.
They love him so much.	Se hâlde sa folle fan him.
I'm sitting in one now.	Ik sit no yn ien.
I wish he never will.	Ik winskje hy nea sil.
I thought of everything.	Ik haw fan alles tocht.
I've seen it here, here and here.	Ik haw it hjir, hjir en hjir sjoen.
But it's not just that.	Mar it is net allinnich dat.
He did and saw nothing.	Hy die en seach neat.
Tell us your thoughts !.	Fertel ús jo gedachten!.
I want a do over.	Ik wol in dwaan oer.
It was time to come back.	It wie tiid om werom te kommen.
These things can be seen.	Dizze dingen kinne sjoen wurde.
So many people love him.	Safolle minsken hâlde fan him.
It just didn’t matter.	It makke gewoan neat út.
I do not want to talk about this.	Ik wol it hjir net oer ha.
She was needed.	Se wie nedich.
I speak.	Ik praat.
There is no problem about that.	Dêr is gjin probleem oer.
And one time he did not return.	En ien kear kaam er net werom.
Was it not good.	Wie it net goed.
Works well.	Wurket goed.
Only the first happened.	Allinnich de earste barde.
They must be very good.	Se moatte hiel goed wêze.
Be angry at us.	Wês lilk op ús.
And we can work with people.	En wy kinne mei minsken wurkje.
She was not afraid.	Se wie net bang.
How many people can say that ?.	Hoefolle minsken kinne dat sizze?.
Now we do.	No dogge wy.
I know you are.	Ik wit do bist.
We work hard to do family things together.	Wy wurkje hurd te dwaan famylje dingen tegearre.
No one died that time.	Gjinien stoar dy tiid.
It did not feel right.	It fielde net goed.
Of course we want it all.	Fansels wolle wy it allegear.
It did not matter to him whether they were human or not.	It makke him neat út oft se minsken wiene of net.
We would not even need a car to get to them.	Wy soene net iens in auto nedich hawwe om by har te kommen.
Do it for yourself.	Doch it foar jo foar jo.
We do not want them to leave here alone.	Wy wolle se net allinnich hjir wei.
Nothing better could happen.	Der koe neat better barre.
We have not had any money for two months.	Wy hawwe twa moanne gjin jild hân.
It happened the same way it always does.	It barde op deselde manier as it altyd docht.
That's not very long.	Dat is net hiel lang.
The young man's idea was good.	It idee fan de jonge man wie goed.
He even opened it.	Hy die it sels iepen.
No one would believe that.	Nimmen soe dat leauwe.
We need to know what's going on.	Wy moatte witte wat der bart.
I do not know how to say it otherwise.	Ik wit net hoe't ik it oars sizze moat.
Never heard of him, no idea who he is.	Nea heard fan him, gjin idee wa't hy is.
People are talking about it.	Minsken hawwe it der oer.
I still feel that way.	Ik fiel my noch altyd sa.
Life became very difficult for us.	It libben waard hiel dreech foar ús.
It was actually for us.	It wie eins foar ús.
He tried to figure out what to do.	Hy besocht út te finen wat te dwaan.
Knew where he came from.	Wist wêr't er oan kaam.
That's how we know it.	Dat is hoe't wy it witte.
He could go.	Hy koe gean.
That was my bad.	Dat wie myn min.
They would not hurt him.	Se soene him net sear dwaan.
If money is not an issue,	As jild gjin probleem is,
He just could not help it. 	Hy koe it gewoan net helpe. 
I love doing that, actually.	Ik hâld fan dwaan dat, eins.
So clear on the.	Sa dúdlik op 'e.
But I got different.	Mar ik krige oars.
You need to see this.	Jo moatte dit sjen.
Someone saw her.	Immen seach har.
He's sure of it.	Hy hat der wis fan.
She wondered where her husband was.	Se frege har ôf wêr't har man wie.
Now you do not worry about me.	No meitsje jo gjin soargen oer my.
Nobody left.	Nimmen oer.
It just makes sense that you can do something with them.	It makket gewoan út dat jo wat mei har dwaan kinne.
So it was.	Sa wie it mar.
If you had said it long ago, you would have been better off.	As jo ​​​​it lang lyn sein hiene, soene jo better west hawwe.
What has happened in the past is in the past.	Wat der yn it ferline bard is, is yn it ferline.
Now we ask this back.	No freegje wy dit werom.
You should know best.	Jo soene it bêste witte.
Someone came.	Der kaam ien.
The question is what happens then.	De fraach is wat der dan bart.
They are easy to find.	Se binne maklik te finen.
We have the money to do it.	Wy hawwe it jild om it te dwaan.
She was tired.	Se wie wurch.
I believe they love me.	Ik leau dat se fan my hâlde.
There's still a chance for you.	Der is noch in kâns foar dy.
I have not found it to be true.	Ik haw net fûn dat it wier is.
The place is really the same with the photo.	It plak is echt itselde mei de foto.
This did not feel like home.	Dit fielde net as thús.
Take another picture now.	Nim no in oare foto.
His family knows me.	Syn famylje ken my.
She never gave up on me.	Se joech my noait op.
That this is not about you caring for us.	Dat dit is net oer jo soargje foar ús.
John arrived late at the meeting.	John kaam te let by de gearkomste.
He's been to many of them, but now is not the time.	Hy hat in protte fan har west, mar it is no net de tiid.
He has no one who loves him.	Hy hat gjinien dy't fan him hâldt.
You have no job.	Jo hawwe gjin wurk.
Of course, there was another way.	Fansels wie der in oare manier.
There had not been much.	Der hie net folle west.
I could not help looking at the old man.	Ik koe it net helpe om nei de âld man te sjen.
She is a good dog.	Se is in goede hûn.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
Nobody sees us.	Nimmen sjocht ús.
As a man.	As in man.
Then one arrives, but does not occur.	Dan komt der ien oan, mar komt net foar.
She wants to talk.	Se wol prate.
He will believe that.	Hy sil dat leauwe.
It will happen on its own.	It sil barre op himsels.
Let me ask you.	Lit my dy freegje.
No one saw it as life.	Nimmen seach it as libben.
Why do not we ask for your help?	Wêrom freegje wy net om jo help?
But please, please come back tomorrow.	Mar asjebleaft, kom asjebleaft moarn werom.
Really he was one of us.	Echt hy wie ien fan ús.
I have a lot.	Ik haw in protte.
Both of these things do not work.	Beide fan dizze dingen wurkje net.
That would be two.	Dat soene twa wêze.
Or a day.	Of in dei.
I hope to see you soon.	Ik hoopje dy gau te sjen.
It's the only thing that has to do with it.	It is it ienige wat der mei te dwaan is.
I will stop, he said.	Ik sil ophâlde, sei er.
It's what makes me different.	It is wat my oars makket.
They can buy a new car.	Se kinne in nije auto keapje.
I think he can do it again.	Ik tink dat er wol wer kin.
And that's just the way it is.	En dat is krekt sa.
When he died, he was very old.	Doe't er stoar, wie er tige âld.
Whatever happens.	Wat der ek bart.
We just knew who the other person was.	Wy wisten gewoan wa't de oare persoan wie.
It really mattered to him.	It kaam him echt ta.
But come on.	Mar kom mar.
I do not do that.	Dat doch ik net.
I heard her.	Ik hearde har.
No food for two days.	Gjin iten foar twa dagen.
But there was one problem.	Mar der wie ien probleem.
I've heard her.	Ik haw har heard.
He could not do enough for her.	Hy koe net genôch foar har dwaan.
It really hurt.	It die echt sear.
For some reason, she stayed home.	Om ien of oare reden bleau se thús.
I said he could go.	Ik sei dat er gean koe.
That's what you're telling her.	Dat is wat jo har fertelle.
Just on this.	Net op dit.
You do not have time to read.	Jo hawwe gjin tiid om te lêzen.
There it is!	Dêr is it!
This is more than that.	Dit is mear as dat.
But no one could tell me what it was.	Mar nimmen koe my fertelle wat it wie.
We no longer know how to do many things.	Wy witte net mear hoe't wy in protte dingen meitsje moatte.
Anyway, until next time.	Hoe dan ek, oant de folgjende kear.
He was tired all the time.	Hy wie de hiele tiid wurch.
Maybe they just look like us.	Miskien lykje se krekt op ús.
They can help.	Se kinne helpe.
The book was very old.	It boek wie tige âld.
We will do everything as one.	Wy sille alles as ien dwaan.
That was all that was said.	Dat wie alles wat sein waard.
We need your help.	Wy hawwe jo help nedich.
It can be good.	It kin wêze goed.
The same thing is happening today.	Itselde bart hjoed gewoan.
What a nothing problem.	Wat in neat probleem.
But, not really.	Mar, net echt.
Do not go home until it is ready.	Gean net nei hûs oant it klear is.
It seemed good.	It like goed.
He was not here or had been and was gone.	Hy wie hjir net of hie west en wie fuort.
I knew what he liked.	Ik wist wat er leuk hie.
With someone there he could not go.	Mei immen dêr koe er net gean.
I never wanted to be.	Ik woe noait wêze.
He found a water and touched it.	Hy fûn in wetter en rekke it oan.
He had something that would give people a reason to worry.	Hy hie wat dat minsken in reden jaan soe ta soargen.
We all did a pretty good job of it.	Wy hawwe der allegear aardich goed wurk fan dien.
But he was very nice.	Mar hy wie hiel aardich.
This is not it.	Dit is it net.
This city is very beautiful.	Dizze stêd is hiel moai.
But no one knew what to do with it.	Mar nimmen wist wat der mei oan moast.
He told me that.	Hy fertelde my dat.
Mom wanted to know everything.	Mem woe alles witte.
Not that he ever did.	Net dat er oait dien hat.
They keep him out of trouble.	Se hâlde him út de problemen.
They will wait just that.	Se sille wachtsje krekt dat.
It came in my name.	It kaam op myn namme.
I did not take them.	Ik naam se net.
Bring your kids along too.	Meitsje jo bern ek mei.
She eats every three hours.	Se yt alle trije oeren.
I want more of that.	Dêr wol ik mear fan.
They need the money.	Se hawwe it jild nedich.
Do your parents know where you are?	Witte jo âlden wêr't jo binne?
Why is this so?	Wêrom is dit sa?
And they do it every day.	En se dogge it alle dagen.
Maybe he knows it will.	Miskien wit er it wol.
However, he showed them.	Hoe dan ek, hy liet se sjen.
He did not know how to get it back.	Hy wist net hoe't er it werom krije moast.
Well, it does not matter.	No, it makket neat út.
When we were both human.	Doe't wy beide minsken wiene.
Where we need to go.	Wêr't wy hinne moatte.
Try to be nice.	Besykje aardich te wêzen.
But better late than never.	Mar better let as nea.
For now, they still have to play when it comes down to it.	Foar no moatte se noch spylje as it der ta docht.
They come out to see us.	Se komme út om ús te sjen.
Not until we get home.	Net oant wy thús komme.
If he will have you without being told to do so.	As hy dy sil hawwe sûnder dat sein wurdt dat te dwaan.
But there you go.	Mar dêr geane jo.
They do not know how we do things here.	Se witte net hoe't wy hjir dingen dogge.
But there was no time for that.	Mar dêr wie gjin tiid foar.
I need to talk to her.	Ik moat mei har prate.
See eat every day.	Se yt alle dagen.
But she knew it all.	Mar se wist it allegear.
Not how they work, but how they work.	Net hoe't se wurkje, mar hoe't se wurkje.
My husband.	Myn man.
This is very good.	Dit is hiel goed.
But something has to happen.	Mar der moat wat barre.
Today just a year ago.	Hjoed krekt in jier lyn.
Look and see.	Sjoch en sjoch.
Not being open about it does not make it go away.	Net iepen wêze oer it makket it net fuort.
Anyone can show up here.	Elkenien kin hjir sjen litte.
I think everyone knows that.	Ik tink dat elkenien dat wit.
I made it with that in mind.	Ik makke it mei dat yn gedachten.
You help him.	Jo helpe him.
So let it be us.	Sa lit it ús wêze.
That was what they did.	Dat wie wat se diene.
I tried to tell you that.	Ik besocht dy dat te fertellen.
Please let me know!.	Lit it my asjebleaft witte!.
We were good friends.	Wy wiene goede freonen.
She told me something.	Se fertelde my wat.
She was not where she needed to be.	Se wie net wêr't se wêze moast.
She knew the reason she did not have that.	Se wist de reden dat se dat net hie.
No idea why, but just wanted to try it.	Gjin idee wêrom, mar woe it gewoan besykje.
He just wants to talk.	Hy wol gewoan prate.
She's probably there now.	Se is der wierskynlik no.
Probably both happened.	Wierskynlik binne beide bard.
He looked at her again.	Hy seach har wer oan.
I know we need to leave our problems at the door.	Ik wit dat wy ús problemen by de doar moatte litte.
Be sure of that.	Wês der wis fan.
But it came together.	Mar it kaam tegearre.
You will eat with us.	Jo sille mei ús ite.
I felt like it was my house.	Ik fielde as wie it myn hûs.
She's very busy.	Se hat it hiel drok.
I do what she never did.	Ik doch wat se noait dien hat.
Just go see what he needs.	Gean mar sjen wat er nedich hat.
Tell us about what you ate.	Fertel ús oer wat jo iten hawwe.
After watching the movie.	Nei it sjen fan de film.
Today, that is.	Hjoed, dat wol.
I've never seen that guy again.	Ik haw dy keardel noait wer sjoen.
I tried to be.	Ik besocht te wêzen.
This makes it good.	Dit makket it goed.
Not so good.	Net sa goed.
No one comes in, or out.	Nimmen komt yn, of út.
Or whatever it is.	Of wat it ek is.
Nobody knows what he's doing.	Nimmen wit wat er docht.
I'm your teacher.	Ik bin dyn learaar.
I have to do this for myself.	Ik moat dit foar my dwaan.
And they do.	En se dogge se.
You have no idea what they are.	Jo hawwe gjin idee wat se.
They live alone.	Se wenne allinnich.
You're a good mother.	Do bist in goede mem.
He should not have been in bed.	Hy hie net op bêd moatten.
Maybe she could help her too?	Miskien koe se har ek helpe?
But it still has its place.	Mar it hat noch syn plak.
That has never happened and can not.	Dat is noait bard en kin net.
This is when it is at its best.	Dit is as it op syn bêste is.
He did not even say, until see.	Hy sei net iens, oant sjen.
There was still so much to do.	Der wie noch safolle te dwaan.
I can not see her too well.	Ik kin har net al te goed sjen.
That really is not how it happens.	Dat is echt net hoe't it bart.
They have not yet come to see me.	Se binne noch net kommen om my te sjen.
He was nice.	Hy wie aardich.
Maybe not ever.	Miskien net ea.
This was not easy for her.	Dit wie net maklik foar har.
That did not come off.	Dat kaam net fuort.
I do not even know what that was.	Ik wit net iens wat dat wie.
He did not like him.	Hy mocht him net.
It was something of an open house.	It wie wat fan in iepen hûs.
I just always have.	Ik ha gewoan altyd.
He may never talk to me again.	Hy mei noait wer mei my prate.
But we could not find one.	Mar wy koene net ien fine.
One day she died.	Op in dei stoar se.
Serve them.	Diene se.
I wanted him to look at me.	Ik woe dat er nei my seach.
These take time.	Dizze nimme tiid.
Maybe you should.	Miskien moatte jo.
This is not necessary.	Dit is net nedich.
Of course we think so.	Wy tinke fansels sa.
If he is, we will stay there that day.	As hy is, dan bliuwe wy dêr de dei.
Maybe she will know.	Miskien sil se it witte.
Well, he knew.	No, hy wist.
His wife and children are here.	Syn frou en bern binne hjir.
Everything else can wait.	Al it oare kin wachtsje.
This is my husband.	Dit is myn man.
If anything, it's likely.	As der wat liket, is it wierskynlik.
Let's see how it goes.	Lit sjen hoe't it giet.
And we have to win.	En wy moatte winne.
His money was gone.	Syn jild wie fuort.
I'm just glad you're fine.	Ik bin gewoan bliid dat jo goed binne.
It has seemed like forever since last time.	It hat like foar altyd sûnt de lêste kear.
I want to get out of here.	Ik wol hjir wei.
It just keeps going and does nothing.	It hâldt der gewoan en docht neat.
And my kids too.	En myn bern ek.
You do everything you can to help them.	Jo dogge alles wat jo kinne om har te helpen.
The day did not go too well.	De dei gie net al te goed.
I could not let her go home.	Ik koe har net nei hûs gean litte.
He could see the girl.	Hy koe it famke sjen.
Please do not let me get sick.	Lit my asjebleaft net siik wurde.
You are.	Do bist.
And now he has done it.	En no hat er it dien.
Life in the city just seemed to go on and on.	It libben yn 'e stêd like gewoan troch te gean.
It was never a problem.	It wie nea in probleem.
It may be my favorite thing ever.	It kin myn favorite ding ea wêze.
This is my life.	Dit is myn libben.
Of course it's us.	Fansels binne it ús.
I'll ask him.	Ik sil it him freegje.
She's nice to me.	Se is aardich foar my.
Better than nothing, of course.	Better dan neat, fansels.
He bought one and I bought one.	Hy kocht ien en ik kocht ien.
But maybe not.	Mar miskien net.
I'm sorry about your mother.	It spyt my fan dyn mem.
And that makes him.	En dat makket him.
We can, we must, and we will do better.	Wy kinne, wy moatte, en wy sille it better dwaan.
She would not stay with a man who did that.	Se soe net bliuwe by in man dy't dat die.
Okay, wait.	Goed, wachtsje.
Good thing she didn 't ask much.	Goed dat se net folle frege hat.
I have done it only a few times.	Ik haw dien it mar in pear kear.
That should do.	Dat moat dwaan.
Also, there would once be a month.	Ek soe der ea in moanne wêze.
You will never get another chance than this.	Jo sille noait in oare kâns krije as dizze.
I will not see them again, or maybe in a few years.	Ik sjoch se net wer, of miskien oer in pear jier.
This happened.	Dit is bard.
I do not know how he deals with it.	Ik wit net hoe't er it der mei oan hat.
It's too soon.	It is te gau.
See in me what you will win.	Sjoch yn my wat jo winne sille.
We will do the same.	Wy sille itselde dwaan.
She heard nothing.	Se hearde neat.
I never wanted him.	Ik woe him noait.
I wish it was different.	Ik woe dat it oars wie.
Why do we need him? 	Wêrom hawwe wy him nedich?
.	.
For so long we have not endured it.	Sa lang hâlde wy it net út.
That’s what they say to me all the time.	Dat sizze se de hiele tiid tsjin my.
I will eat everything.	Ik sil alles ite.
I did not know if I should hope or not.	Ik wist net oft ik hoopje moast of net.
I had it.	Ik hie it hân.
I need your help.	Ik ha dyn help nedich.
Maybe they just love it.	Miskien hâlde se it gewoan.
I do not live there.	Ik wenje dêr net.
Look around us.	Sjoch om ús hinne.
They do their job.	Se dogge har wurk.
I do not have much water anymore.	Ik ha net folle wetter mear.
It is now a few months old.	It is no in pear moanne âld.
It was like my house.	It wie as myn hûs.
The other was.	De oare wie.
He was very good at it.	Hy wie der tige goed yn.
He was happy	Hy wie bliid
I'm really hard at work.	Ik bin echt hurd oan it wurk.
Of course, there was never really any question about that.	Dêr wie fansels noait echt fraach oer.
It was not his favorite room.	It wie net syn favorite keamer.
Exactly.	Krekt ek.
My husband was worried.	Myn man wie soargen.
Just one bad day.	Krekt ien minne dei.
Everyone else does.	Elkenien oars docht.
In fact, you might be able to help as well.	Eins kinne jo miskien ek helpe.
When he got home, he found his wife in bed.	Doe't er thús kaam, fûn er syn frou op bêd.
That being said, try to make a plan first.	Dat wurdt sein, besykje earst in plan te meitsjen.
But if you have a problem, come to me.	Mar as jo in probleem hawwe, kom dan nei my.
I'm not making that up.	Ik meitsje dat net op.
He was told it was one of his.	Hy waard ferteld dat it ien fan syn wie.
But, that's what the police do.	Mar, dat is wat de plysje docht.
They could not handle it.	Se koene it net oan.
That's when he wants help.	Dat is as er help wol.
I wish him back home.	Ik winskje him werom nei hûs.
We want to be sure of that.	Wy wolle der wis fan wêze.
Not sure what else to do here.	Net wis wat oars te dwaan hjir.
It did not go in.	It gie net yn.
See, her parents are coming back for her.	Sjoch, har âlden komme werom foar har.
Could it be this ?.	Kin it dit wêze?.
How can that be?	Hoe kin dat?
To get out of bed.	Om út it bêd te kommen.
We talk a lot.	Wy prate in protte.
I never really liked the word.	Ik haw it wurd noait echt leuk fûn.
But he is old.	Mar hy is âld.
The only question then is how did this happen?	De iennichste fraach is dan hoe is dit bard?
I need my friends.	Ik haw myn freonen nedich.
It's just.	It is gewoan.
He should not have been.	Hy hie net wêze moatten.
Without water there would be no life.	Sûnder wetter soe der gjin libben wêze.
People are buying more things now than ever before.	Minsken keapje no mear dingen as eartiids.
Her friends were worried about her.	Har freonen wiene soargen foar har.
I can not say it completely.	Ik kin it net hielendal sizze.
Maybe take us away from that place.	Miskien nimme ús wei fan dat plak.
That needs to be talked about.	Dêr moat oer praat wurde.
She did not even want to think of him.	Se woe net iens oan him tinke.
All evening she never spoke.	De hiele jûn hat se noait praat.
.	.
What are you doing or planning to do?	Wat jo dogge of fan plan binne te dwaan is?
We are nice.	Wy binne aardich.
If you go on both, that's a bit of it.	As jo ​​​​op beide geane, is dat sa'n bytsje it.
This is not difficult.	Dit is net dreech.
But, boy, does it come up.	Mar, jonge, komt it op.
Just to be clear.	Krekt om dúdlik te wêzen.
I really know the family.	Ik ken de famylje echt.
They did the work.	Se hawwe it wurk dien.
Children need to be careful.	Bern moatte foarsichtich wêze.
He's my friend too.	Hy is myn freon ek.
Well, we're out of time.	No, wy binne út 'e tiid.
I show her thoughts.	Ik lit har gedachten sjen.
The two work as one.	De twa wurkje as ien.
Then he goes back to his book.	Dan giet er werom nei syn boek.
Everyone here knows it.	Elkenien hjir wit it.
I have family and friends and school.	Ik haw famylje en freonen en skoalle.
He had said the words.	Hy hie de wurden sein.
You will need help.	Jo sille help nedich hawwe.
I thought so much.	Ik tocht safolle.
Needless to say, she walked away.	Net nedich om te sizzen, se gie fuort.
They are not the problem.	Se binne net it probleem.
There is no reason for that.	Der is gjin reden foar.
I'm paying attention.	Ik let op.
If it does not, you will not.	As it net docht, sille jo net.
We make it up as we go.	Wy meitsje it op as wy gean.
All are person to person.	Allegear binne persoan ta persoan.
You need nothing else.	Jo hawwe neat oars nedich.
Please let me know if you have any other questions.	Lit my asjebleaft witte as jo oare fragen hawwe.
He did not look away.	Hy seach net fuort.
We'll show it to you if you are not away.	Wy sille it sjen litte as jo net fuort binne.
He did not look forward to reading.	Hy seach der net út nei it lêzen.
Is the bus coming today?	Komt de bus hjoed?
I have no money.	Ik ha gjin jild.
It's so.	It is sa.
She is my life, this is my life.	Se is myn libben, dit is myn libben.
Do the same for him.	Doch itselde foar him.
I can tell you nothing else.	Ik kin dy neat oars fertelle.
He had done his job well.	Hy hie syn wurk goed dien.
He's a great guy.	Hy is in grutte keardel.
I just felt like.	Ik fielde gewoan as.
We have become really good friends this year.	Wy binne dit jier echt goede freonen wurden.
I do not want her to go.	Ik wol net dat se giet.
The problem is that no one really knows what he wants.	It probleem is dat nimmen echt wit wat er wol.
Your hair looks so beautiful.	Dyn hier sjocht der sa moai út.
I look forward to that day.	Ik sjoch út nei dy dei.
He walked to her door.	Hy rûn nei har doar ta.
I'm trying to finish this book.	Ik besykje dit boek ôf te meitsjen.
I know they do.	Ik wit dat se dogge.
They need some of you.	Se hawwe wat fan dy nedich.
He had no children and a slightly different family.	Hy hie gjin bern en in bytsje oare famylje.
It's just.	It is gewoan.
I just know the name.	Ik wit gewoan de namme.
Please wake me up when it's time to go.	Meitsje my asjebleaft wekker as it tiid is om te gean.
And I did it.	En ik die it.
Leave that to me.	Lit dat oan my oer.
They do not even know it yet.	Se witte it noch net iens.
I'm really into it.	Ik gean der echt oan.
But so it goes.	Mar sa giet it.
He was hers.	Hy wie fan har.
It was him.	It wie hy.
So it was.	Sa wie it.
The kids like to be away.	De bern binne graach fuort.
They are not just children anymore.	It binne net allinnich bern mear.
It will do us both good.	It sil ús beide goed dwaan.
He was planning something.	Hy wie wat fan plan.
I was not against it.	Ik wie der net tsjin.
I can too.	Ik kin ek wol.
We do not yet know what he will be like.	Wy witte noch net hoe't hy wêze sil.
He does not like me.	Hy hâldt net fan my.
This does not concern you.	Dit giet dy net oan.
Still, you're here now.	Noch, do bist hjir no.
Think about whether you agree with it.	Tink nei oft jo it der mei iens binne.
Only this was different.	Allinnich dizze wie oars.
I never had one.	Ik hie noait ien.
If he does, you have nothing to worry about.	As hy docht, do hast neat te soargen oer.
We really need it.	Wy hawwe it tige nedich.
It was not real.	It wie net echt.
I knew they would not.	Ik wist dat se net soene.
You care.	Jo soargje.
It is also different from what you believe.	It is ek oars as wat jo leauwe.
It works but not in the right way.	It wurket mar net op 'e goede manier.
At the time.	Op 'e tiid.
You will have a great party.	Jo sille in moai feest hawwe.
Probably not the time or the place.	Wierskynlik net de tiid of it plak.
A lot of everything, you might say.	In protte fan alles, kinne jo sizze.
This is how it should be.	Dit is hoe't it moat.
He had already been seen.	Hy wie al sjoen.
And it works well.	En it wurket goed.
I know you have.	Ik wit dat jo hawwe.
He should of course be.	Hy soe fansels wêze moatte.
The room is just as usual.	De keamer is krekt as altyd.
But without much thought.	Mar sûnder folle tocht.
There is no way.	Der is gjin wei.
You have to believe me.	Jo moatte my leauwe.
But we still have many more questions to get through.	Mar wy hawwe noch folle mear fragen om troch te kommen.
The question is, why, and why now ?.	De fraach is, wêrom, en wêrom no?.
But if you do not know, you are doing well.	Mar as jo net witte, dogge jo goed.
No one will see us.	Nimmen sil ús sjen.
Of course, it's a real book.	Fansels is it in echt boek.
You have seen what they are like when they are together.	Jo hawwe sjoen hoe't se binne as se tegearre binne.
People love this place.	Minsken hâlde fan dit plak.
And we wait.	En wy wachtsje.
She never met him.	Se hat him nea moete.
And that we must keep.	En dat moatte wy hâlde.
She had made a plan.	Se hie in plan makke.
When do you want this?	Wannear wolle jo dit?
I also have to be careful.	Ik moat ek foarsichtich wêze.
You just go.	Jo gewoan gean.
He has the hand in everything.	Hy hat de hân yn alles.
They just.	Se gewoan.
You can do this yourself if you know how.	Jo kinne dit sels dwaan as jo witte hoe.
I had seen it.	Ik hie it sjoen.
That was clear early on.	Dat wie betiid dúdlik.
And do not take my word for it.	En nim myn wurd der net foar.
I did not think it through enough.	Ik tocht it net genôch troch.
We're trying something different.	Wy besykje wat oars.
But she had, and she would tomorrow too.	Mar se hie, en se soe moarn ek.
That's clear enough.	Dat is dúdlik genôch.
To really do work.	Om echt wurk te dwaan.
I'm still waiting to see it.	Ik wachtsje noch om it te sjen.
I tell it to other people.	Ik fertel it oan oare minsken.
I was a bad boy.	Ik wie in minne jonge.
But he felt it.	Mar hy fielde it.
From his friends.	Fan syn freonen.
She knew nothing of this man, not even his name.	Se wist neat fan dizze man, net iens syn namme.
She will tell you that it is true.	Se sil jo fertelle dat it wier is.
It came to him again.	It kaam wer foar him.
But they were also old.	Mar se wiene ek âld.
There is no one to be seen here.	Der is hjir gjinien te sjen.
Why he did that, no one now knows.	Wêrom't er dat die, wit no nimmen.
They are not the problem.	Se binne net it probleem.
There is a lot that needs to be done.	D'r is in protte dat dien wurde moat.
I want to do what's good.	Ik wol dwaan wat goed is.
But here, here was something.	Mar hjir, hjir wie wat.
The father was out of work for three months.	De heit siet trije moanne sûnder wurk.
Tell him you were just ready for bed or something.	Fertel him dat jo krekt klear wiene foar bêd of sa.
Or whatever it is.	Of wat it ek is.
I have no idea how to do this.	Ik haw gjin idee hoe't ik dit meitsje.
And boy did it look bad.	En jonge seach it der min út.
And one day she does.	En op in dei docht se it.
I gave it back to him.	Ik joech it him werom.
But it is so.	Mar it is sa.
Then there is another child.	Dan is der noch in bern.
Make everything right.	Meitsje alles goed.
This is actually just too little.	Dit is eins net al te min.
I take time every day to do it.	Ik nim alle dagen tiid om it te dwaan.
The size did not matter to him.	De grutte makke him neat út.
She was an ordinary girl, but she needed him.	Se wie in gewoan famke, mar se wie him nedich wurden.
We want you here.	Wy wolle dy hjir.
I do not want this life anymore.	Ik wol dit libben net mear.
You probably know that.	Jo wierskynlik witte dat.
Think that woman scared him so much.	Tink dat dy frou him sa bang makke.
My good guy said nothing.	Myn goede keardel sei neat.
They could help us some.	Se koene ús wat helpe.
You've been doing this kind of thing all your life.	Jo hawwe al jo libben dit soarte ding dien.
Life is hard.	It libben is dreech.
To continue.	Om troch te gean.
We met last night right here in this room.	Wy moete fannacht krekt hjir yn dizze keamer.
There is nothing of the sort.	Der is neat fan it soarte.
You've said that twice now.	Dat ha jo no twa kear sein.
His work was done.	Syn wurk wie dien.
So was the girl.	Sa wie it famke.
There was not much to do while they waited.	Der wie net folle te dwaan as se wachtsje.
He ran away and never came back.	Hy rûn fuort en kaam noait werom.
I think it comes from there.	Ik tink dat it dêr wei komt.
Do not buy it.	Keapje it net.
What did he want, she asked herself.	Wat woe er, frege se har ôf.
You have to talk when you talk.	Jo moatte prate as jo prate.
Everything else can stay the same.	Al it oare kin itselde bliuwe.
She just had to wait until he got there.	Se moast mar wachtsje oant er dêr kaam.
But there's more where that came from.	Mar d'r is mear wêr't dat wei kaam.
A man was killed.	Der is in man om it libben kaam.
He was nice to me.	Hy wie aardich tsjin my.
But it will be fine.	Mar it sil goed wêze.
Everyone wants something different.	Elkenien wol wat oars.
I'm not going to her.	Ik gean net nei har ta.
It says something.	It seit wat.
But that will not happen.	Mar dat sil net barre.
I was hurt.	Ik rekke sear.
There was nothing about it that was true or genuine.	Der wie neat oer dat wier of echt wie.
She had told the truth.	Se hie de wierheid ferteld.
You can then go.	Jo kinne dan gean.
Do not let them know these things.	Lit har dizze dingen net witte.
Hope to finish that one, tonight.	Hoopje dat ien ôf te meitsjen, fannacht.
We were here.	Wy wiene hjir by.
Nobody loves her.	Nimmen hâlde fan har.
Make people agree with you.	Meitsje minsken it mei jo iens.
There were people in the house.	Der wiene minsken yn it hûs.
They agreed not to agree.	Se wiene it iens om it net iens te wêzen.
I '.	ik'.
I would love to work on this for you.	Ik sil graach wurkje oan dit foar dy.
I love me now.	Ik hâld fan my no.
Take it, boy.	Nim it, jonge.
I had no time for that.	Ik hie der gjin tiid foar.
She might have done otherwise.	Se hie miskien oars dien.
I'm very happy to say that now, we are.	Ik bin hiel bliid om te sizzen dat no, wy binne.
He's just a man.	Hy is mar in man.
A friend of mine.	In freon fan my.
I got the same.	Ik haw itselde krigen.
And no one knows why.	En gjinien wit wêrom.
He had not come up with the idea on his own.	Hy wie net op himsels op it idee kommen.
Man knows she knows.	Man wit se wit.
I did the same with your father.	Ik die itselde mei dyn heit.
So it had to be.	Sa moast it wêze.
There's more to the job than you know.	Der is mear oan it wurk as jo witte.
Is scared of me.	Is bang foar my.
Did you hear what she said?	Hawwe jo heard wat se sei?
One time the man came back very late.	Ien kear kaam de man tige let werom.
Nothing to go back for.	Neat om foar werom te gean.
I'm not out of there yet.	Ik bin der noch net út.
People who cared about you.	Minsken dy't om dy soargen.
Believe it or not.	Leau it oer ús.
They are also a whole lot of work.	Se binne ek in hiele protte wurk.
Or maybe you are.	Of miskien binne jo it.
He probably has me over now.	Hy hat my wierskynlik oer no.
She came to see me.	Se kaam om my te sjen.
Just think about what you are doing.	Tink gewoan oer wat jo dogge.
This city did not cooperate.	Dizze stêd wurke net mei.
I love everyone.	Ik hâld fan elkenien.
Maybe there's another reason.	Miskien is der in oare reden.
I made it.	Ik haw it makke.
He could go to friends and family.	Hy koe nei freonen en famylje gean.
We still know nothing for sure.	Wy witte noch neat wis.
We have no idea.	Wy hawwe gjin idee.
The work was completed on time.	It wurk wie op tiid klear.
It can not get him well.	It kin him net goed komme.
There's no way she could not.	D'r is gjin manier dat se it net koe.
Just say that.	Se die gewoan.
They have been trying to do this for two or three years.	Dat hawwe se al twa of trije jier besocht.
That's easy.	Dat is maklik.
I remained friends with her.	Ik bleau freonen mei har.
I did and it worked.	Ik die en it wurke.
Give him three more.	Jou him noch trije.
Something needs to be done.	Der moat wat dien wurde.
I think she's so good at her job.	Ik tink dat se sa goed is yn har wurk.
She had never asked him.	Se hie him noait frege.
She may even have a boyfriend.	Se kin sels in freon hawwe.
That they would do, he knew.	Dat soene se dwaan, wist er.
At first you do not even know what happened.	Earst witte jo net iens wat der bard is.
Take this letter with you.	Nim dit brief mei dy.
I would like to know what you think of it.	Ik soe graach witte wat jo der fan fine.
I told her my idea.	Ik fertelde har myn idee.
It felt so good.	It fielde sa goed.
I know she's not.	Ik wit dat se net is.
Put it together, let's see.	Meitsje it tegearre, lit sjen.
I think that will hurt her more than anything.	Ik tink dat dat har mear sear dwaan sil as wat dan ek.
I think a lot of people do that kind of thing.	Ik tink dat in protte minsken dat soarte dingen dogge.
In fact, that was the first way.	Eins wie dat de earste manier.
So it can happen.	Sa kin it barre.
His parents are so angry at him.	Syn âlden binne sa lilk op him.
I did not know you could do this.	Ik wist net dat jo dit dwaan koene.
But you are wrong.	Mar do bist ferkeard.
Which is true.	Wat wier is.
I do not believe he can.	Ik leau net dat er kin.
He is the man who makes everyone happy.	Hy is de man dy't elkenien bliid makket.
I'm glad you do not live in this city now, father.	Ik bin bliid dat jo no net yn dizze stêd wenje, heit.
Please be very careful.	Wês asjebleaft tige foarsichtich.
The dog was sick.	De hûn wie siik.
he says.	hy seit.
The other was long ago.	De oare wie al lang lyn.
They know the work he has done.	Se witte it wurk dat er dien hat.
I could see he was trying very hard.	Ik koe sjen dat er hiel hurd besocht.
They would not tell us why.	Se soene ús net fertelle wêrom.
But this week it was one after the other.	Mar dizze wike wie it ien nei de oare.
I do not want them.	Ik wol se net.
She certainly liked him.	Se mocht him wis leuk fine.
Make it as good as you can.	Meitsje it sa goed as jo kinne.
I should have been something.	Ik hie wat wêze moatten.
It was not difficult.	It wie net dreech.
He never told us about this!	Hy hat ús noait oer dit ferteld!
There is no one in the latter.	D'r is gjinien yn 'e lêste.
We'll have to talk to your father.	Wy sille mei jo heit prate moatte.
It had not been easy.	It hie net maklik west.
It was hard for her too.	It wie har ek dreech.
We can ask you nothing else.	Wy kinne jo neat oars freegje.
Still do not know why he asked.	Noch altyd net witte wêrom't er frege.
She needed the money.	Se hie it jild nedich.
And then we can do something.	En dan kinne wy ​​wat dwaan.
It must be the new one.	It moat de nije wêze.
I can not think about what other people think of me.	Ik kin net tinke oer wat oare minsken fan my tinke.
There was just nothing.	Der wie gewoan neat.
He went through with it.	Hy gie der troch.
I opened the door.	Ik die de doar iepen.
It happened again.	It barde wer.
But in fact, you did not say you were coming today.	Mar eins ha jo net sein dat jo hjoed komme.
For me, it's nothing.	Foar my is it neat.
I know it has to.	Ik wit dat it moat.
That was angry, no question.	Dat wie lilk, gjin fraach.
She's like another person.	Se is as in oare persoan.
It would be very different.	It soe hiel oars wurde.
I wish she had done it better, actually.	Ik winskje se hie dien it better, eins.
Just one word.	Krekt ien wurd.
This time it was my mother.	Dizze kear wie it myn mem.
I saw him do that.	Ik seach him dat dwaan.
Take that.	Nim dat.
Maybe he saw, maybe not.	Miskien seach er, miskien net.
That's a chance.	Dat is der in kâns.
Easy, she said.	Maklik, sei se.
The city looks the same as any other.	De stêd liket itselde as alle oare.
Let it play.	Lit it mar spylje.
It just did not happen.	It barde gewoan net.
I can not talk too long.	Ik kin net te lang prate.
I do not want to stay here.	Ik wol hjir net bliuwe.
She thought of nothing.	Se tocht oan neat.
They do not pay me to have one.	Se betelje my net om ien te hawwen.
If he's still here, we'll find him tomorrow.	As er hjir noch is, fine wy ​​him moarn.
Children get tired.	Bern wurde wurch.
There is a reason for that.	Dêr is in reden foar.
That I had expected.	Dat hie ik ferwachte.
I talked to him a lot about it.	Ik ha der in protte mei him oer praat.
More questions, just ask.	Mear fragen, freegje gewoan.
It was hard to say exactly what he thought.	It wie dreech om krekt te sizzen wat er tocht.
He was sure it was her.	Hy wie der wis fan dat it har wie.
And children need more of it.	En bern hawwe der mear fan nedich.
We are out of time.	Wy binne út de tiid.
He has no dog.	Hy hat gjin hûn.
Of course, he actually eats nothing.	Fansels yt er eins neat.
We all have to work hard.	Wy moatte allegear hurd wurkje.
He would go to his room.	Hy soe nei syn keamer.
That's your only job.	Dat is dyn ienige baan.
He's just an idea now.	Hy is no mar in idee.
They did not.	Dat diene se net.
I want you to talk to us.	Ik wol dat jo mei ús prate.
No wrong word about her, really.	Gjin ferkeard wurd oer har, wier.
So it seems he was not clear on what his name is.	Sa liket it derop dat er net dúdlik wie oer wat syn namme is.
I told him to stop and let me look at it.	Ik sei tsjin him om op te hâlden en lit my der nei sjen.
That that had happened.	Dat dat bard wie.
He was very open and ready to talk to us.	Hy wie heul iepen en ree om mei ús te praten.
He knew it too.	Hy wist it ek.
She started saying something but did not.	Se begûn wat te sizzen mar die net.
A bad month, that was.	In minne moanne, dat wie.
We want to get it.	Wy wolle it krije.
I can not agree.	Ik kin net iens.
The whole family lived in the house.	De hiele famylje wenne yn it hûs.
I want to try new things.	Ik wol nije dingen besykje.
The other thing he knew was that it was time to go.	It oare ding dat er wist wie dat it tiid wie om te gean.
It does everything it says it does.	It docht alles wat it seit dat it docht.
That is different now.	Dat is no ek oars.
She never asked me for money, or to buy her anything.	Se frege my noait om jild, of om har wat te keapjen.
All right then.	Goed dan.
She's your best friend and she should know about us.	Se is jo bêste freon en se soe oer ús moatte witte.
I wish you would come.	Ik winskje dat jo komme.
She never told me about it.	Se hat my der noait oer ferteld.
It has nothing to do with you.	It is neat mei dy te dwaan.
Come back if nothing happened.	Kom wer as neat bard.
This is how I made it.	Dit is hoe't ik haw makke.
But he found that he did not want to know.	Mar hy fûn dat er it net witte woe.
Who can help me?	Wa kin my helpe?
Maybe it was not either.	Miskien wie it ek net.
I want to leave it at that.	Dêr wol ik it by litte.
They never need two.	Se hawwe noait twa nedich.
He asked about you.	Hy frege oer dy.
This would have been good.	Dit soe goed west hawwe.
It was hard work, and someone had to take it.	It wie hurd wurk, en immen moast it nimme.
I'm the one he needs.	Ik bin dejinge dy't er nedich hat.
How will you find your way home?	Hoe sille jo jo wei nei hûs fine?
It will not work.	It sil net wurkje.
I'm talking to someone who did this a few years ago, actually.	Ik praat mei ien dy't dit in pear jier lyn dien hat, eins.
He did things.	Hy hat dingen dien.
That's what my husband said.	Dat hat myn man sein.
I used to work in his office.	Ik wurke eartiids op syn kantoar.
You have come.	Do bist kommen.
But one person was allowed to leave immediately.	Mar ien persoan mocht fuort fuort.
I could talk to anyone about anything.	Ik koe mei elkenien oer alles prate.
It can even be fun.	It kin sels leuk wêze.
The city talks and talks.	De stêd praat en praat.
This is for everything.	Dizze is foar alles.
You should need it.	Jo moatte it nedich hawwe.
Ask his name.	Freegje syn namme.
But they were nothing like she had ever seen.	Mar se wiene neat as se ea sjoen hie.
You're not good.	Do bist net goed.
I really do not need this.	Ik haw dit echt net nedich.
You did not see him.	Do hast him net sjoen.
Are you with me ?.	Binne jo mei my?.
But let's try to be.	Mar litte wy besykje te wêzen.
I do not want to talk to you.	Ik wol net mei dy prate.
It goes well with her.	It komt goed mei har.
It can not.	It kin net.
But it also sat in her.	Mar it siet ek yn har.
Until evening.	Oan't jûn.
I do not really care.	Ik nim my der net echt oan.
Do not be too late.	Wês net te let.
It will never be.	It sil nea wêze.
And whatever it was, everything would be fine.	En wat it ek wie, alles soe goed komme.
There is still more to do.	Der is noch mear te dwaan.
They are fun.	Se binne leuk.
She went home.	Se gie nei hûs.
Try that a few times.	Besykje dat in pear kear.
It was good to be back.	It wie goed om werom te wêzen.
I'm still scared of it.	Ik bin der noch bang foar.
Never went back.	Nea gie werom.
If you want to see it.	As jo ​​it sjen wolle.
Now there are no problems.	No binne d'r gjin problemen.
I was a little scared too.	Ik wie ek wat bang.
He did not think so.	Hy tocht net.
The big and.	De grutte en.
It's not easy, of course.	It is net maklik, fansels.
We know what to do.	Wy witte wat te dwaan.
People think they are.	Minsken tinke dat se binne.
So we have.	Sa hawwe wy.
It's so clear.	It is sa dúdlik.
We took care of her until tomorrow.	Wy soargen foar har oant moarn.
It's too late for that now.	Dêr is it no te let foar.
It should never have been made.	It hie nea makke wurde moatten.
But that guy is so over.	Mar dy keardel is sa oer.
I feel a little bad, but he does not know me.	Ik fiel my wat min, mar hy ken my net.
I agree.	Ik bin it iens kommen.
But he was not.	Mar hy wie net.
Please take the money.	Nim it jild asjebleaft.
Think carefully about this.	Tink goed oer dit.
A great man.	In grutte man.
He was still in prison.	Hy siet noch yn de finzenis.
This he had done.	Dit hie er dien.
Now and forever.	No en foar altyd.
It's about what she does with her '.	It giet om wat se mei har docht'.
He said so himself.	Dat sei er sels.
They both agreed.	Se wiene it beide iens.
I believe it will.	Ik leau it wol.
I saw that.	Ik seach dat.
Please do not go with me, let me go myself.	Gean asjebleaft net mei my, lit my sels gean.
Everyone had told him he would be free today.	Elkenien hie him sein dat er hjoed frij wêze soe.
We can not do that yet.	Dat kinne wy ​​noch net.
She had not thought he could be here.	Se hie der net yn tocht dat er hjir wêze koe.
But there's one thing you should not ask me.	Mar d'r is ien ding dat jo my net moatte freegje.
I asked him if he needed to talk.	Ik frege him oft er prate moast.
I'm in trouble here.	Ik sit hjir yn de problemen.
But they do not know what to do.	Mar se witte net wat te dwaan.
There was no time for more.	Der wie gjin tiid foar mear.
They can put you in jail.	Se kinne jo yn 'e finzenis sette.
It could even be you.	It kin sels jo wêze.
He was a man of faith.	Hy wie in man fan leauwe.
This was so.	Dit wie sa.
If we do not have children, we will just come back.	As wy gjin bern hawwe, komme wy gewoan werom.
For one of us.	Foar ien fan ús.
Not that they could even see much of anything here.	Net dat se hjir sels folle fan wat sjen koene.
Children always get in trouble.	Bern komme altyd yn de problemen.
I did not want to stay in the house.	Ik woe net yn 'e hûs bliuwe.
But nothing gave.	Mar neat joech.
Do not worry, we're going!	Sit gjin soargen, wy geane!
I'm just telling you.	Dat fertel ik dy mar.
I'm not that girl.	Ik bin dat famke net.
Hard work was what he needed now.	Hurd wurk wie wat er no nedich hie.
And then, after dinner.	En dan, nei it iten.
Old.	Âld.
The truth is the truth.	De wierheid is de wierheid.
I can not seem to figure it out.	Ik kin it net lykje út te finen.
He wanted to be with her tonight.	Hy woe fannacht by har wêze.
I doubt anything will come of it.	Ik twifelje dat der wat fan komt.
She did not know why she thought he would be different.	Se wist net wêrom't se tocht hie dat er oars wêze soe.
You know you want one.	Jo witte dat jo ien wolle.
But he never said much.	Mar hy sei nea folle.
They had a child together.	Se krigen tegearre in bern.
But that was it.	Mar dat wie.
I just sat there.	Ik siet der mar.
I can believe it.	Ik kin it leauwe.
And we have to get away.	En wy moatte fuort fuort.
But what if.	Mar wat as.
I know no one else who can, but maybe they can.	Ik ken nimmen oars dy't kin, mar miskien kinne se.
Or maybe it was to help her children.	Of miskien wie it om har bern te helpen.
She wanted to help him get better.	Se woe him helpe om better te wurden.
He said where he was walking.	Hy sei wêr't er rûn.
But maybe there is more to it.	Mar miskien is der mear oan.
You're not the first.	Do bist net de earste.
Now we know he did not take it.	No witte wy dat hy it net naam.
I'm here to tell you something.	Ik bin kommen om dy wat te fertellen.
Everything had gone against him.	Alles wie him tsjin gien.
I think they were very good.	Ik tink dat se wiene hiel goed.
Today is the big day.	Hjoed is de grutte dei.
He did just that.	Dat die er krekt.
This could not be it.	Dit koe it net wêze.
He never does it.	Hy docht it noait.
I would not let him.	Ik soe him net litte.
She did come.	Se kaam wol.
He must want better.	Hy moat better wolle.
But it's not good.	Mar it is net goed.
Have a plan in place.	Hawwe in plan yn plak.
We'll get this done.	Wy sille dit dien krije.
What does not happen.	Wat net bart.
But that also did not feel much like the truth.	Mar dat fielde ek net folle as de wierheid.
He saw two people in the car.	Hy seach twa minsken yn de auto.
I never did anything to her.	Ik haw har noait wat dien.
Or even what he is.	Of sels wat hy is.
I was surprised it was still so early.	Ik wie ferrast dat it noch sa betiid wie.
Just a day or two.	Krekt in dei as twa.
I'm not talking about her.	Ik praat net fan har.
Never been there before.	Dêr ek noch nea earder yn west.
It's clear to me now.	It is no dúdlik foar my.
It's pretty clear that this is what should have happened.	It is frij dúdlik dat dat is wat bard wêze moat.
But only a little.	Mar mar in bytsje.
Here was nothing, nothing.	Hjir wie neat, neat.
But wait there is more.	Mar wachtsje der is mear.
I knew you were coming back.	Ik wist dat jo werom komme.
That was my job.	Dat wie myn wurk.
That was the first idea.	Dat wie it earste idee.
Mine does the same.	Myn docht itselde.
I never knew what to say.	Ik wist noait wat te sizzen.
You know it's probably going to hurt, but you can not see.	Jo witte dat it wierskynlik sear sil, mar jo kinne net net sjen.
Well, now nothing.	No, no neat.
Someone was watching.	Immen seach nei.
I just had to be really angry at someone.	Ik moast gewoan echt lilk wêze op immen.
I'll tell you now.	Ik sil it dy no fertelle.
I know what to do.	Ik wit wat te dwaan.
If we're with only one girl, it does not work.	As wy mei mar ien famke binne, wurket it net.
He keeps it open.	Hy hâldt it iepen.
Everything like it.	Alles as it.
But it's not my home.	Mar it is net myn thús.
I have a child at home.	Ik haw in bern thús.
He saw the truth about himself.	Hy seach de wierheid oer himsels.
Of everyone and no one, of everything and nothing.	Fan elkenien en nimmen, fan alles en neat.
I asked how long he had been there.	Ik frege hoe lang hy der west hie.
Now it's time for me to say.	No is it tiid foar my om te sizzen.
I know a guy.	Ik ken in keardel.
Let's go out to dinner tonight.	Litte wy fannacht út iten gean.
So there may be a way to do the same.	Sa kin der in manier wêze om itselde te dwaan.
People just need to be seen as people.	Minsken moatte gewoan as minsken sjoen wurde.
She needs to stay at work.	Se moat oan it wurk bliuwe.
They love it.	Se hâlde it.
Don't worry too much.	Meitsje der net folle om.
And eat she does.	En yt se docht.
He tried it, but he had been here before.	Hy besocht it, mar hy hie hjir earder west.
I'm not so sure.	Ik bin der net sa wis fan.
I'll ask for it tonight, she thought.	Ik sil it fannacht freegje, tocht se.
He would think of me more in his way than ever.	Hy soe my mear op syn manier tinke dan ea.
In the car.	Yn de auto.
I know my class.	Ik ken myn klasse.
She liked me there.	Se like my dêr.
You ask him what he will do.	Jo freegje him wat hy sil dwaan.
What we knew to be true was not true.	Wat wy wisten dat wier wie, wie net wier.
I'm sure of that.	Dêr bin ik wis fan.
That's not likely here.	Dat is hjir net wierskynlik.
Let that show.	Lit dat sjen litte.
Everyone knows how to do that.	Elkenien wit hoe't dat moat.
I can not do this.	Ik kin dit net dwaan.
It just could not.	It koe gewoan net.
You too.	Jo ek.
When he was ready, he was ready.	Doe't er klear wie, wie er klear.
I still remember what she said, too.	Ik wit noch wat se sei, te.
Who are the two people in this photo?	Wa binne de twa minsken op dizze foto?
This may be it.	Dit kin it wêze.
One man has a better chance.	Ien man hat in bettere kâns.
I do not know the word.	Ik ken it wurd net.
The other is better.	De oare is better.
Of course he was.	Fansels wie hy.
The sure thing.	It wis ding.
It could not be that there was not enough around.	It kin net wêze dat der net genôch wie om hinne.
One of these is not having a house.	Ien fan dizze is gjin hûs te hawwen.
He would not let her go.	Hy soe har net litte litte.
And we have no week.	En wy hawwe gjin wike.
I still live there.	Ik wenje dêr noch.
I was really looking forward to those days.	Ik seach echt út nei dy dagen.
Do not do that again.	Doch dat net wer.
Nobody likes to come here, we know that.	Nimmen mei hjir graach komme, dat witte wy.
And there we talk about a bit.	En dêr prate wy oer in bytsje.
But the other three are not.	Mar de oare trije binne net.
What anyone would want.	Wat immen soe wolle.
It's the best !.	It is de bêste!.
There are also plenty of those around now.	Der binne no ek genôch fan dy om hinne te gean.
I think those kids are on to something.	Ik tink dat dy bern op wat binne.
I did not ask to be.	Ik frege net om te wêzen.
She just talked.	Se hat krekt praat.
Most likely there was.	Hiel wierskynlik wie der.
It will help.	It sil helpe.
There, now you're free, but stop.	Dêr, no bist frij, mar hâld op.
There is.	Dêr is.
The first for one of us.	De earste foar ien fan ús.
It gets better from that.	Dêr wurdt it better fan.
Where she heard.	Wêr't se hearde.
He was an old man.	Hy wie in âld man.
I just had you.	Ik hie dy krekt.
If necessary, leave the house.	As it nedich is, gean it hûs út.
I have a chance for him.	Ik haw in kâns foar him.
Free from all worries, it keeps nothing in mind.	Frij fan alle soargen, it hâldt neat yn gedachten.
We do not believe.	Wy leauwe net.
It was or was true.	It wie of wier.
She asked us what was going on.	Se frege ús wat der bart.
Behold, she knows the child all his life.	Sjoch, se ken it bern syn hiele libben.
They know this.	Se witte dit.
If you have any questions, just ask me.	As jo ​​​​fragen hawwe, freegje my gewoan.
I do not know, but we can.	Dat wit ik net, mar dat kinne wy ​​wol.
We'll have to pay.	Wy sille moatte betelje.
What is, is.	Wat is, is.
First just a few people.	Earst mar in pear minsken.
He did not say where.	Hy sei net wêr.
No one had come to the house yet.	Der wie noch net ien by it hûs kommen.
You should have gone with him.	Do hiest mei him gean moatten.
For the good of everyone.	Foar it goede fan elkenien.
And we have to.	En wy moatte.
I could be wrong though.	Ik koe wol ferkeard wêze.
He could have another one.	Hy koe noch ien hawwe.
I want to know.	Ik wol it witte.
That's very good.	Dat is hiel goed.
The old man knew how that was.	De âld man wist hoe't dat wie.
This can also be seen in the film.	Yn de film is dat ek te sjen.
It was on mine.	It wie op myn.
I will give him so much.	Ik sil him safolle jaan.
I think we will.	Ik tink dat wy sille.
But no one wanted it.	Mar nimmen woe it.
Be careful.	Gean foarsichtich.
She could see them, but they could not see them.	Se koe se sjen, mar se koene har net sjen.
I was right there.	Ik wie der krekt.
They know where we need to go.	Se witte wêr't wy hinne moatte.
You do not have to do anything.	Jo hoege neat te dwaan.
You think you know what they're doing.	Jo tinke dat jo witte wat se dogge.
He was just a guy.	Hy wie mar in keardel.
See what he says.	Sjoch wat er seit.
There is not much time left for me.	Der is net folle tiid mear foar my.
This and much more.	Dizze en folle mear.
The only friend in the house.	De ienige freon yn 'e hûs.
But it may be too late.	Mar it kin te let wêze.
So you have to believe me.	Sa moatte jo my leauwe.
But it was her.	Mar it wie har.
He knows how to do that, so many things.	Hy wit hoe't dat moat, safolle dingen.
Okay, go away.	Goed, gean fuort.
That can not be.	Dat kin net.
This is our life and we love what we do.	Dit is ús libben en wy hâlde fan wat wy dogge.
He already has it for you.	Hy hat it al foar dy.
Tomorrow something would happen.	Moarn soe der wat barre.
A few months.	In pear moanne.
We are friends, but we are very different.	Wy binne freonen, mar wy binne hiel oars.
More can be done than you expected.	Der kin mear dien wurde dan jo ferwachte.
If you do, this is for you.	As jo ​​​​dat dogge, is dit foar jo.
That, you know, we need to see.	Dat, jo witte, wy moatte sjen.
Which should be enough.	Wat genôch wêze moat.
No one knew the child was in the room.	Nimmen wist dat it bern yn 'e keamer wie.
I was afraid of what would happen.	Ik wie bang foar wat der barre soe.
That would do nothing of the sort.	Dat soe hjir neat fan wolle.
That should have happened.	Dat hie barre moatten.
When he showed up, it was late.	Doe't er sjen liet, wie it let.
My mother was.	Myn mem wie.
And so for a few weeks.	En sa foar in pear wike.
We have always been different.	Wy hawwe altyd oars west.
She could not believe what had just happened.	Se koe net leauwe wat der krekt bard wie.
Tell her you love her and everything will be fine.	Fertel har dat jo fan har hâlde en alles sil goed wêze.
Not sure if that's good or bad.	Net wis oft dat goed of min is.
This looks good again.	Dit sjocht der wer goed út.
Doing is my thing.	Dwaan is myn ding.
I'm still trying to figure this thing out.	Ik besykje noch dit ding út te finen.
I can not think for everyone.	Ik kin net foar elkenien tinke.
She knew what he was planning.	Se wist wat er fan plan wie.
I tried very hard but ran out early.	Ik besocht hiel hurd, mar rûn út betiid.
I only need one.	Ik ha mar ien nedich.
They make it.	Se meitsje it.
What if.	Wat as.
She would have to go.	Se soe gean moatte.
It will be a long time coming.	It sil noch lang dreech wurde.
I'll have to pay for you to go to school.	Ik sil foar jo betelje moatte om nei skoalle te gean.
Good in words.	Goed yn wurden.
I'm still one of 'us'.	Ik bin noch altyd ien fan 'ús'.
That could be.	Dat soe wêze kinne.
She was afraid he would not let her.	Se wie bang dat er har net litte soe.
That should not be the case.	Dat moat der net.
That maybe he was gone this time.	Dat hy miskien dizze kear fuort wie.
The door is often open.	De doar stiet faak iepen.
And we will need what they know.	En wy sille nedich wat se witte.
We know how to do it better than anyone.	Wy witte hoe te dwaan it better as elkenien.
My father sat in there.	Myn heit siet der yn.
Let me make something clear.	Lit my wat dúdlik meitsje.
He wanted to be with her.	Hy woe mei har.
But they are not the same.	Mar se binne net itselde.
You need it now.	Jo hawwe it no nedich.
We have nothing to do.	Wy hawwe neat te dwaan.
Which, of course, is not true.	Wat fansels net wier is.
It will come in handy.	It sil goed komme.
No one knew what they were doing.	Nimmen wist wat se diene.
It could not be true.	It koe net wier wêze.
You are not real for long.	Bist net lang echt.
This had not happened here for a long time.	Dit wie hjir noch lang net bard.
I feel like you can never eat enough.	Ik fiel dat jo noait genôch ite kinne.
He has done so much for me.	Hy hat safolle foar my dien.
I know everyone was very worried about that.	Ik wit dat elkenien dêr tige soargen oer wie.
You can stay there as long as you need to.	Jo kinne dêr bliuwe sa lang as jo nedich binne.
She had seen him.	Se hie him sjoen.
The meeting was all about him.	De gearkomste wie alles oer him.
Can someone please tell me about the best way to do this.	Kin immen my asjebleaft fertelle oer de bêste manier om dit te dwaan.
Neither did they.	Dat diene se ek net.
Both had young children.	Beide hiene jonge bern.
We have never had such a thirty year.	Wy hawwe noch noait sa'n tritich jier hân.
He will help us.	Hy sil ús helpe.
Time goes by.	De tiid giet troch.
They would go home.	Se soene nei hûs.
They were good to eat.	Se wiene goed te iten.
Get away from me! 	Gean fan my ôf!
To give more.	Mear te jaan.
Be free.	Frij wêze.
I could not tell.	Ik koe it net fertelle.
Very nice book.	Hiel moai boek.
That's my family.	Dat is myn famylje.
He needed all the help he could get.	Hy hie alle help nedich dy't er krije koe.
I knew she would be fine.	Ik wist dat se goed wêze soe.
Time to go home.	Tiid om nei hûs te gean.
I love words to go and pass them by hand.	Ik hâld fan wurden om te gean en se mei de hân troch te jaan.
And then wake up.	En dan wekker wurde.
This child is two years old.	Dit bern is twa jier âld.
She said she was.	Se sei dat se wie.
I'm here to help.	Ik bin hjir om te helpen.
We only got a little money.	Wy krigen mar in bytsje jild.
He wanted you.	Hy woe dy.
A once in a lifetime opportunity.	In ien kear yn in libben kâns.
Not that he did not know this, but had her with him.	Net dat er dit net wist, mar har by him hie.
We were at school together.	Wy wiene tegearre op skoalle.
Which of the following is true?	Hokker fan 'e folgjende is wier?
They buy everything they need or want.	Se keapje alles wat se nedich binne of wolle.
There is no reason for you to be angry.	D'r is gjin reden foar jo om lilk te wêzen.
What she really wanted was to stay and talk.	Wat se echt woe wie bliuwe en prate.
I never thought there was so much to it, she says.	Ik hie noait tocht dat der safolle oan siet, seit se.
I tried so hard last time.	Ik besocht sa hurd lêste kear.
I do not know, nor what.	Ik wit it net, noch wat.
I would be happy.	Ik soe bliid wêze.
It almost looks like it's not there.	It liket der hast op dat it der net is.
Was that true?	Wie dat wier?
I'll try to get there tonight.	Ik sil besykje der fannacht oan te kommen.
Me neither.	Ik ek net.
This is a first.	Dit is in earste.
Must then be ready.	Moat dan klear wêze.
If not this hour.	As net dit oere.
Nobody knows anything.	Nimmen wit neat.
That's what we saw.	Dat hawwe wy sjoen.
We hope you come and visit us soon !.	Wy hoopje dat jo gau komme besykje ús!.
You can do it all too.	Jo kinne it ek hielendal dwaan.
It just so happens.	It bart gewoan sa.
Now the problem is that it's always true.	No is it probleem dat it altyd wier is.
He never had a bad word to say about anyone.	Hy hie nea in ferkeard wurd te sizzen oer immen.
That was what it did.	Dat wie wat it die.
And mom and dad too.	En mem en heit ek.
I did not expect.	Ik ferwachte net.
I'll be there, do not worry.	Ik sil der wêze, meitsje jo gjin soargen.
It needs money.	It hat jild nedich.
It was really happening.	It wie echt bart.
And for your dog.	En foar jo hûn.
They've been talking for an hour.	Se prate al in oere.
You have had.	Jo hawwe hân.
Good enough to eat.	Goed genôch om te iten.
What we have is real.	Wat wy hawwe is echt.
Probably he even thought he had.	Wierskynlik tocht er sels dat er hie.
We are free.	Wy binne frij.
I feel like a child again.	Ik fiel my wer as in bern.
This may sound like a good idea, but who will pay?	Dit liket in goed idee, mar wa sil betelje?
Why not visit me soon?	Wêrom net gau besykje my?
You know how it is.	Jo witte hoe't it is.
Everyone needs good friends.	Elkenien hat goede freonen nedich.
There is no water.	Der is gjin wetter.
I already know who it is.	Ik wit al wa't it is.
I do not think anyone will.	Ik tink net dat immen sil.
I'll take care of it all.	Ik sil it allegear soargje.
Now it's pretty bad.	No is it aardich min.
I do not think she has ever been beautiful.	Ik tink net dat se oait moai west hie.
I lived at home with my mom and dad.	Ik wenne thús by myn mem en heit.
I did not buy anything.	Ik haw neat kocht.
It would not do.	It soe net dwaan.
Here are three issues.	Hjir binne trije problemen.
This could not happen again.	Dit koe net wer barre.
Just give them what they want.	Jou har gewoan wat se wolle.
He could not help himself.	Hy koe him net helpe.
But he must try.	Mar hy moat besykje.
Well, at least we didn't go down without explaining ourselves first.	No goed, dêr wiene wy ​​fansels bliid om, mar op ien of oare manier.
Where are they going?	Wêr binne se hinne?
I do not see you tonight.	Ik sjoch dy fannacht net.
It was about tomorrow.	It gie oer moarn.
Not what they say.	Net wat se sizze.
Well, let me tell you.	No, lit my it dy fertelle.
I'm ready and it's your time to take over.	Ik bin klear en it is dyn tiid om oer te nimmen.
I already have money.	Ik haw al jild.
I know he must be hurt.	Ik wit dat er sear wurde moat.
I'm looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der nei.
She just wants to tell me in person.	Se wol gewoan fertelle my yn persoan.
His mother said it.	Syn mem sei it.
Has he or his parents ever visited.	Hat hy of syn âlden oait besocht.
We want a bit of both.	Wy wolle in bytsje fan beide.
It was nice to see you.	It wie moai dy te sjen.
Let's go into town.	Litte wy de stêd yn gean.
No one can tell.	Nimmen kin fertelle.
It goes for what he wants.	It giet foar wat er wol.
She said she was sorry.	Se sei dat se it spyt hie.
There was something else.	Der wie wat oars.
And came back.	En kaam werom.
She is no longer afraid of him.	Se is net mear bang foar him.
Just do not go.	Gean gewoan net.
It is best to keep this in mind.	It is it bêste om dit yn gedachten te hâlden.
Now you're just waiting.	No wachtsje jo mar.
I do know one thing.	Ik wit wol ien ding.
Not with me, of course.	Net by my, fansels.
We are now back to two to three times a week.	Wy binne no werom nei twa oant trije kear yn 'e wike.
The problem is, everyone has had the same idea.	It probleem is, elkenien hat itselde idee hân.
But if he knew.	Mar as er wist.
I saw him every day.	Ik seach him alle dagen.
And he still had his life.	En hy hie noch syn libben.
People are happy again.	Minsken binne wer bliid.
So do you.	Dat docht dy ek.
Now this can go for a man or a woman.	No kin dit gean foar in man of in frou.
Here's a truth.	Hjir is in wierheid.
Another one.	Noch ien.
Let him do it himself.	Lit him it sels dwaan.
You will do well.	Jo sille it goed dwaan.
Food was very good.	Iten wie hiel goed.
That's what's happening here.	Dat is wat hjir bart.
That's exactly how we did it.	Dat is krekt hoe't wy it dien hawwe.
He ran out of class.	Hy rûn de klasse út.
He's still here.	Hy is hjir noch.
It's day one.	It is dei ien.
They were nice enough to look up to, but one could get hurt.	Se wiene aardich genôch om op te sjen, mar ien koe sear krije.
You know, it's not a bad idea.	Jo witte, it is gjin min idee.
Is one that.	Is ien dat.
We're in trouble.	Wy binne yn de problemen.
Our children are doing well.	It giet goed mei ús bern.
I would not be able to get through that.	Ik soe der dan net troch kinne.
There was no way around it.	Der wie gjin wei om it hinne.
This is one month time.	Dit is ien moanne tiid.
But here we were.	Mar hjir wiene wy.
The woman is angry.	De frou is lilk.
There was one at home.	Der wie ien thús.
She says she loves her boy.	Se seit dat se fan har jonge hâldt.
He has not come to school anymore.	Hy is net mear nei skoalle kommen.
I go to my room.	Ik gean nei myn keamer.
It was probably good.	It wie wierskynlik goed.
It's like that again.	It is wer sa.
That's what we find here.	Dat fine wy ​​hjir wol sa.
We need to see my father.	Wy moatte myn heit sjen.
A week, maybe.	In wike, miskien.
Then the father.	Dan de heit.
Even now, even without looking, she knew exactly where he was.	Sels no, sels sûnder te sjen, wist se krekt wêr't er wie.
I'm not even sure.	Ik bin der net iens wis fan.
You're not friends.	Do bist gjin freonen.
It's about what he does.	It giet oer wat er docht.
Sure, everything could be just fine.	Wis, alles koe gewoan goed.
I will not leave you hope.	Ik sil jo hope net litte.
Since that day he joined us.	Sûnt dy dei kaam er by ús yn.
I did not see it either.	Ik seach it ek net.
It must go away.	It moat fuort.
She used to think so too.	Se tocht eartiids ek sa.
There is nothing more we can do to help.	Wy kinne neat mear dwaan om te helpen.
Even if there was another way, we would never find it.	Sels as der in oare manier wie, soene wy ​​it noait fine.
Just paying for it was the thing.	Krekt betelje foar it wie it ding.
Of course she goes back to him.	Fansels giet se werom nei him.
I got one.	Ik krige ien.
You love your job.	Jo hâlde fan jo wurk.
He was still good.	Hy wie noch goed.
Such a one.	Sa'n ien.
But he was ready for me.	Mar hy wie klear foar my.
I do not know if it will.	Ik wit net oft it wol.
She might have been hours away.	Se hie miskien wol oeren west.
They are not afraid anymore.	Se binne net bang mear.
She had not done badly.	Se hie it net min dien.
I'm afraid of what might happen then, even if she's not.	Ik bin bang foar wat der dan barre kin, sels as se dat net is.
You had a good idea there a few years ago.	Jo hiene in goed idee dêr in pear jier lyn.
I just did it.	Ik haw it krekt dien.
Please make yourself at home.	Meitsje jo asjebleaft thús.
People need to know what happened.	Minsken moatte witte wat der bard is.
But she was afraid to say anything.	Mar se wie bang om wat te sizzen.
Which could not always.	Wat net altyd koe.
He just walked into the house.	Hy gie krekt it hûs yn.
Not sure if much else.	Net wis oft folle oars.
But of course, she would not be there.	Mar fansels, se soe der net wêze.
It seems everyone is interested.	It liket derop dat elkenien ynteressearre is.
Just said it.	Krekt sei it.
I had been.	ik hie west.
Everyone loves them.	Elkenien hâldt fan har.
He was just not with me anymore.	Hy wie gewoan net mear mei my.
I knew everything.	Ik wist alles.
You are the father of everyone.	Do bist de heit fan elkenien.
I do not know how they will do that.	Ik wit net hoe't se dat dwaan sille.
It's not as easy as you think.	It is net sa maklik as jo tinke.
But today they will be.	Mar hjoed sille se wêze.
Everything in place.	Alles op syn plak.
But it's time to say enough is enough.	Mar it is tiid om te sizzen genôch is genôch.
Neither works for me.	Gjin fan beide wurket foar my.
Do not be afraid.	Wês net bang.
Now they do everything together.	No dogge se alles tegearre.
But we knew who knew it.	Mar wy wisten wa't it wist.
We better get someone here to see this.	Wy kinne hjir better ien krije om dit te sjen.
She could love that.	Dêr koe se fan hâlde.
There was nothing else he could do.	D'r wie neat oars dat er dwaan koe.
Put him to bed now!	Jou him no op bêd!
I will not say which.	Ik sil net sizze hokker.
This came through clearly.	Dit kaam dúdlik troch.
Nobody comes out.	Nimmen komt út.
I think more people should be like that, actually.	Ik tink dat mear minsken sa wêze moatte, eins.
You can have them out there.	Jo kinne hawwe se út dêr.
This is where you live.	Dit is wêr jo wenje.
I'm getting away.	Ik kom fuort.
He says there will be a job for me.	Hy seit dat dêr in baan foar my komt.
I have no idea if she wants to.	Ik ha gjin idee oft se wol.
It was pretty real.	It wie aardich echt.
This is a great.	Dit is in grutte.
You only get one.	Jo krije mar ien.
But she looked like one.	Mar se like ien.
No one would buy it.	Nimmen soe it keapje.
But it's hard for him to be with us.	Mar it is dreech foar him om by ús te wêzen.
Of course they are not.	Fansels binne se net.
I'll look into it.	Ik sil der wol op sjen.
And will never be.	En sil nea wêze.
We have everything we need here.	Wy hawwe hjir alles wat wy nedich binne.
It was just one, you might say.	It wie mar ien, kinne jo sizze.
And your husband.	En dyn man.
I've thought of this before too.	Ik ha hjir ek al earder oan tocht.
Well, this boy does not.	No, dizze jonge net.
He could never tell her that.	Dat koe er har nea sizze.
But now he would also get the chance.	Mar no soe hy ek de kâns krije.
He was really nice, she said.	Hy wie echt aardich, sei se.
It just could not.	It koe gewoan net.
And then it all works.	En dan wurket it allegear.
It was a long time ago.	It wie al lang lyn.
Nothing and nothing gets in their way.	Nimmen en neat komme har yn 'e wei.
They had become friends.	Se wiene freonen wurden.
You do this.	Jo dogge dit.
The big problem is this.	It grutte probleem is dit.
Of course, this is not the only way.	Fansels is dit net de ienige manier.
I think you saw it first.	Ik tink dat jo de earste sjoen hawwe.
And so it is.	En sa is it.
Make and make.	Meitsje en meitsje.
She saw something.	Se seach wat.
However, they were now gone.	Hoe dan ek, se wiene no fuort.
The truth is not how you want it to be.	De wierheid is net hoe't jo it wolle wêze.
And how do they do it?	En hoe dogge se?
I did not hear you coming, and.	Ik hearde dy net kommen, en.
This could not be true.	Dit koe net wier wêze.
However, he did not know much about it.	Hoe dan ek, hy koe der net folle fan witte.
That's exactly what I found.	Dat fûn ik krekt.
This is my chance.	Dit is myn kâns.
I did not want one.	Ik woe net ien.
I think it was just me.	Ik tink dat it krekt my wie.
I could talk.	Ik koe prate.
They did not do that.	Dat hawwe se net dien.
Ask her how her day is going.	Freegje har hoe't har dei giet.
He could not say why he thought so.	Hy koe net sizze wêrom't er dat tocht.
You had a bad day.	Jo hiene in minne dei.
There was something off about what happened.	Der wie wat ôf oer wat der barde.
He had even walked home with her once or twice.	Hy wie sels ien of twa kear mei har nei hûs rûn.
You just need a good teacher.	Jo hawwe gewoan in goede learaar nedich.
People keep telling us.	Minsken bliuwe fertellen ús.
But you found me.	Mar jo hawwe my fûn.
First, you need to know the way to get there.	Earst moatte jo de manier witte om dêr te kommen.
She was obviously not there.	Se wie der fansels net.
They have had the last thirty years.	Se hawwe de lêste tritich jier hân.
And of course the other two.	En fansels de oare twa.
They do not know where they live.	Se witte net wêr't se wenje.
So he said.	Sa sei er.
Maybe he was.	Miskien wie hy.
Everyone was angry at her.	Elkenien wie lilk op har.
Not a whole lot of time, but maybe enough.	Net in hiele protte tiid, mar miskien genôch.
I can still love her as a family.	Ik kin noch fan har hâlde as famylje.
It's too much, too much.	It is te folle, te folle.
Now we are best friends.	No binne wy ​​bêste freonen.
I was busy at work on our way out.	Ik wie drok oan it wurk op ús wei út.
She had nothing to do with it.	Se hie der neat mei te krijen.
I'm angry that someone might be like that.	Ik bin lilk dat immen sa kin wêze.
It's entirely up to the people.	It is hielendal oan de minsken.
I do not want him either.	Ik wol him ek net.
They just happen.	Se barre gewoan.
It gave us something to talk about.	It joech ús wat om oer te praten.
He had to see.	Hy moast sjen.
I'm not here to be friends with anyone.	Ik bin hjir net om freonen te wêzen mei immen.
Try not to talk.	Besykje net te praten.
This works better.	Dit better wurk.
I love this book.	Ik hâld fan dit boek.
I will never say 'maybe'.	Ik sil noait 'miskien' sizze.
I took a day off from work.	Ik naam in dei frij fan it wurk.
Now with the car.	No mei de auto.
But she could do nothing.	Mar se koe neat dwaan.
She has many friends.	Se hat in protte freonen.
I opened it and let him go.	Ik die iepen en liet him derop gean.
They are in me.	Se binne yn my.
Back again and again and again.	Werom wer en wer en wer.
It was this.	It wie dit.
I'm nothing more.	Ik bin neat mear.
Goes bit by bit.	Giet bytsje by bytsje.
They're in some kind of trouble.	Se binne yn in soarte fan problemen.
I have done a good job.	Ik haw dien in goed wurk.
I'm right there.	Ik bin der krekt.
We ask for your help.	Wy freegje om jo help.
The sooner it comes, the better for us.	Hoe earder it komt, hoe better foar ús.
He leaves him there.	Hy lit him dêr.
Of course they were not.	Fansels wiene se net.
I just wanted something to eat.	Ik woe krekt wat te iten.
But none of it was ever gone.	Mar neat fan it wie ea fuort.
I would not know.	Ik soe it net witte.
You do not have to look over the house today.	Jo hoege hjoed net oer it hûs te sjen.
I have faith that she will.	Ik haw it leauwe dat se sil.
None of these things were done.	Gjin fan dizze dingen waard dien.
I'm more worried about you.	Ik bin mear soargen foar dy.
It was just that they were there.	It gie der allinnich om dat se der wiene.
And it works for me.	En it wurket foar my.
He had a wife.	Hy hie in frou hân.
They were no different now.	Se wiene no net oars.
What lived there he was himself.	Wat der wenne wie hy sels.
None of it seemed real.	Gjin fan it like echt.
His latest book is just out this week.	Syn lêste boek is dizze wike krekt út.
I knew what she was going to do.	Ik wist wat se dwaan soe.
Do not go on about what he is doing.	Gean net op wat hy docht.
You made it better.	Jo hawwe it better makke.
She is not a mother at all.	Se is hielendal gjin mem.
I will be visiting my family next week.	Ik sil nije wike myn famylje besykje.
True we are.	Wier binne wy.
The year started well.	It jier begûn goed.
He showed me how.	Hy liet my sjen hoe.
All of these are round.	Al dizze binne rûn.
He could be here.	Hy koe hjir wêze.
She was my best friend.	Se wie myn bêste freon.
You would put the whole thing on me.	Jo soene it hiele ding op my sette.
There must be something to give, and give quickly.	Der moat wat jaan, en gau jaan.
I do not buy it.	Ik keapje it net.
That was the whole thing.	Dat wie it hiele ding.
He would not show it to anyone.	Hy soe it oan nimmen sjen litte.
Here, give me your hand.	Hjir, jou my dyn hân.
Has all her friends read it.	Hat al har freonen it lêzen.
I did not work at all.	Ik wurke hielendal net.
If it were really easy, everyone would do it.	As it wier maklik wie, soe elkenien it dwaan.
But she knew she had to try.	Mar se wist dat se besykje moast.
He wanted what he wanted.	Hy woe wat er woe.
It also makes me angry.	It makket my ek lilk.
I never realized this.	Ik haw dit noait realisearre.
There are no words here.	Der binne gjin wurden hjir.
But again, another chance gave him.	Mar wer, in oare kâns joech him.
He is in her.	Hy is yn har.
But that has to happen soon.	Mar dat moat gau.
It was just like, there you go.	It wie krekt as, dêr geane jo.
If they do not want my money, they will not have it.	As se myn jild net wolle, sille se it net hawwe.
Best idea we've ever had.	Bêste idee dat wy ea hân hawwe.
Show him.	Lit him sjen.
It must be something to keep in mind.	It moat wat wêze om yn gedachten te hâlden.
You have already done so much for this city.	Jo hawwe al safolle dien foar dizze stêd.
His was a hard life.	Syn wie in hurd libben.
It's my last year.	It is myn lêste jier.
You do what you are told.	Jo dogge wat jo sein wurdt.
And even that is good.	En sels dat is goed.
Now she knew she had to.	No wist se dat se it moast.
I know of your parents.	Ik wit fan dyn âlden.
This seems to help a bit.	Dit liket in bytsje te helpen.
That is not true.	Dat is net wier.
She did not want to leave it.	Se woe it net litte.
He is free to go.	Hy is frij om te gean.
I got there.	Ik kaam der.
And the problem is the people who are in office.	En it probleem is de minsken dy't yn kantoar binne.
I had thought it would hurt more.	Ik hie tocht dat it mear sear dwaan soe.
She did not like my family.	Se mocht myn famylje net.
And that is true for many people.	En dat is wier foar in protte minsken.
Again, just not this day.	Eartiids, gewoan net dizze dei.
But they did not know enough.	Mar se wisten net genôch.
He knows how.	Hy wit hoe.
He tried to look.	Hy besocht te sjen.
Nothing is easy.	Neat is maklik.
I never felt that way again.	Ik nea fielde dat sa wer oant.
That was probably a few months ago.	Dat wie wol in pear moanne lyn.
The photo did not seem to me.	De foto like my net.
The work is done.	It wurk is dien.
Almost but not quite.	Hast mar net hielendal.
She said she had no money.	Se sei dat se gjin jild hie.
So it has always been, and probably always will be.	Sa hat it altyd west, en sil wierskynlik altyd wêze.
I can not go back home.	Ik kin net werom nei hûs.
And it was not children, one of these people.	En it wiene gjin bern, ien fan dizze minsken.
I can wait and see how it goes.	Ik kin wachtsje en sjen hoe't it giet.
She is never wrong.	Se is nea ferkeard.
But it does not happen.	Mar it bart net.
I was sick.	Ik wie siik.
It's going well.	It komt goed.
He actually tried.	Hy hat eins besocht.
Well done, do.	Goed dien, do.
Dog eats dog, they say.	Hûn yt hûn, sa sizze se.
I'm sure you agree.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo it iens binne.
A woman comes home from school.	In frou komt thús fan skoalle.
He is one life we ​​must take.	Hy is ien libben dat wy moatte nimme.
But this happens.	Mar dit bart.
This is just not true.	Dit is gewoan net wier.
Like me very much.	Like my tige.
I could tell she had made it herself.	Ik koe fertelle dat se it sels makke hie.
It was beautiful.	It wie moai.
They're coming through, man.	Se komme troch, man.
That's what we need to talk about.	Dêr moatte wy it oer hawwe.
You will do it with this.	Jo sille it dwaan mei dizze.
She liked to watch.	Se mocht graach sjen.
Maybe she wants to.	Miskien wol se.
You did it right.	Do hast it goed dien.
He tried to hurt me, but he let me go.	Hy besocht my sear te meitsjen, mar hy liet my frij.
She could not do much about it.	Dêr koe se net folle oan dwaan.
He wants you to tell him all about it.	Hy wol dat jo him der alles oer fertelle.
I'm not better than anyone else.	Ik bin net better as immen oars.
But it does not have to be.	Mar it hoecht net te wêzen.
He makes everyone around him better.	Hy makket elkenien om him hinne better.
It may be me this time.	It kin my wêze dizze kear.
And hair that used to be beautiful and alive.	En hier dat eartiids moai en libben west hie.
Both were only children.	Beide wiene allinnich bern.
That should not happen in another month.	Dat soe noch in moanne net barre moatte.
She would do it.	Se soe it dwaan.
Now it's like it's never been there.	No is it as wie it der noait.
That's how it should be.	Sa moat it wêze.
He did not seem scared at all.	Hy like hielendal net bang.
She asked the man to open the door.	Se frege de man de doar iepen te dwaan.
As if it's never enough.	As is it noait genôch.
I would not give this to anyone.	Ik soe dit oan gjinien jaan.
See how beautiful he is.	Sjoch hoe moai hy is.
In fact, she still does.	Eins docht se noch altyd.
More than once, even.	Mear as ien kear, sels.
Nothing was what it seemed.	Neat wie wat it like.
Why would she worry? 	Wêrom soe se har soargen meitsje?
We are all from the same family.	Wy binne allegear fan deselde famylje.
It's nothing.	It is neat.
He could be anyone.	Hy koe elkenien wêze.
It's hard not to do it.	It dreech is om it net te dwaan.
It was our father.	It wie ús heit.
She's trouble, you.	Se is problemen, dy.
Last month, but whatever.	Ferline moanne, mar wat dan ek.
I did not get one.	Ik krige gjin ien.
The girl thought she was beautiful.	It famke tocht dat se moai wie.
You can say what you say, but you are what you are.	Jo kinne sizze wat jo sizze, mar jo binne wat jo binne.
Just nice for tonight.	Krekt moai foar fannacht.
This is what people were talking about.	Dit is wêr't minsken it oer hiene.
At last he was free.	Lang om let wie er frij.
A difficult place.	In dreech plak.
No one else will help you.	Nimmen oars sil jo helpe.
But not done yet.	Mar noch net dien.
He just wanted to talk, and talk we did.	Hy woe gewoan prate, en prate wy diene.
The car was free.	De auto wie frij.
Even if we do not have it.	Ek as wy it net hawwe.
But they are good.	Mar se binne goed.
Leave it to me.	Lit it oan my oer.
He probably has almost none.	Hy hat wierskynlik hast gjinien.
We will do nothing.	Wy sille neat dwaan.
I love time free from work.	Ik hâld fan tiid frij fan it wurk.
And they want away.	En se wolle fuort.
But, here we are.	Mar, hjir binne wy.
Well, he more than I do.	No, hy mear as ik.
It was like going back in time.	It wie as werom yn de tiid.
Well, not always.	No, net altyd.
It works well.	It wurket goed.
He had some problems when he started.	Hy hie wat problemen doe't er begûn.
But he had to deal with what he had received.	Mar hy moast it dwaan mei wat er krigen hie.
We ask what we did wrong.	Wy freegje wat wy ferkeard dien hawwe.
She wants to see him.	Se wol him sjen.
I never gave him a chance.	Ik haw him noait in kâns jûn.
He just needs some help.	Hy hat gewoan wat help nedich.
Can't see her now.	Kin har no net sjen.
If she was eating now.	As se no oan it iten wie.
It was just the two of them.	It wiene gewoan de twa.
We can go better.	Wy kinne better gean.
I just wanted to see my family again.	Ik woe gewoan myn famylje wer sjen.
She opened the door.	Se die de doar iepen.
We only have a few years left.	Wy hawwe noch mar in pear jier oer.
It's something open to me.	It is wat iepen foar my.
Of course, this is not yet true.	Fansels is dit noch net wier.
For an hour.	Foar in oere.
I want to be needed.	Ik wol nedich wêze.
We say nothing.	Wy sizze neat.
Now, what can we say?	No, wat kinne wy ​​sizze?
He is as bad as expected.	Hy is sa min as ferwachte.
I just did something wrong.	Ik die krekt wat ferkeard.
We do not need it now.	Wy hawwe it no net nedich.
Do not make up the past.	Meitsje it ferline net op.
Nobody had one.	Nimmen hie ien.
Here again two things happened.	Hjir barde wer twa dingen.
I did something.	Ik die wat.
He said nothing at first.	Hy sei earst neat.
I should not say it.	Ik soe it net sizze moatte.
I'll show you how it's done.	Ik sil dy sjen litte hoe't it dien wurdt.
This has never happened to me before.	Dit is my noch noait earder bard.
She's so cute.	Se is sa leuk.
I go to work every day.	Ik gean alle dagen oan it wurk.
Angry even at these words.	Lilk sels op dizze wurden.
This is of course already happening.	Dit bart fansels al.
That movie is not that good.	Dy film is net sa goed.
I've never worked so hard as now.	Ik haw noch noait sa hurd wurke as no.
He just could not get enough of her.	Hy koe gewoan net genôch fan har krije.
It was true though.	It wie wol wier.
If you do, you will have problems.	As jo ​​dat dogge, sille jo problemen hawwe.
If you have me that is.	As jo ​​my hawwe dat is.
We do not want to hurt you.	Wy wolle dy net sear dwaan.
That's what he does here.	Dat docht er hjir.
That you know, keep it up.	Dat jo witte, hâld it troch.
Do what she says.	Doch wat se seit.
He had to do a lot of things.	Hy hie in protte dingen dwaan moatten.
What else you want, let us know.	Wat jo oars wolle, lit it ús witte.
Very few are.	Hiel pear binne.
But you do not worry.	Mar jo meitsje jo gjin soargen.
I do not, of course.	Ik net, fansels.
Maybe even your life.	Miskien sels dyn libben.
That was so much hard work.	Dat wie safolle hurd wurk.
His whole life.	Syn hiele libben.
For hours and hours.	Foar oeren en oeren.
Probably husband and wife.	Wierskynlik man en frou.
I'm worried enough.	Ik haw soargen genôch.
What did we do?	Wat hawwe wy dien?
He came back.	Hy kaam werom.
He wants back.	Hy wol werom.
Can try it too.	Kin it ek besykje.
She had no time for that.	Se hie der gjin tiid foar.
But one person took them in.	Mar ien persoan naam se yn.
What if it's normal.	Wat as it gewoan is.
Not even my mother.	Net iens myn mem.
We can not wait.	Wy kinne net wachtsje.
It's so much more.	It is safolle mear.
He did not like place.	Hy like net plak.
Whatever happens always has a reason why it happens.	Wat der ek bart hat altyd in reden, wêrom it bart.
I want more.	Ik wol mear.
He knew them well.	Hy koe se goed.
It would be best to get this over with.	It soe it bêste wêze om dit oer te krijen.
I feel happy to come over and help.	Ik fiel my bliid om oer te kommen en te helpen.
That never stopped.	Dat bleau nea op.
I can not return.	Ik kin net werom.
He gets in there.	Hy komt der yn.
The child was a boy, and all was well.	It bern wie in jonge, en alles wie goed.
He knows what he's doing.	Hy wit wat er docht.
He did not wait any longer.	Hy wachte net mear.
He did not ask if she was alone.	Hy frege net oft se allinnich wie.
There are even more to come.	Der komme noch mear by.
We want to be sure of that.	Wy wolle der wis fan wêze.
She saw no person from her house.	Se seach gjin persoan út har hûs.
My mother did what she wanted.	Myn mem die wat se woe.
I know this, you know this.	Ik wit dit, jo witte dit.
Maybe not.	Miskien wol net.
And now I.	En no ik.
Him! ' 	Him!'
he said.	hy sei.
But of course he would not do that.	Mar dat soe er fansels net dwaan.
Can look at it though.	Kin der wol nei sjen.
This one does the work.	Dizze docht it wurk.
She had not tried to be with another man.	Se hie net besocht mei in oare man te wêzen.
I would be too.	Ik soe ek wêze.
Great photo, mind you.	Grutte foto, tink.
We did get that.	Dat ha wy wol krigen.
That was the big thing.	Dat wie it grutte ding.
I leave this door open and so does my door.	Ik lit dizze doar iepen litte en myn doar ek.
She has nothing more.	Mear hat se net.
We do not want to be seen.	Wy wolle net sjoen wurde.
It scared me.	Dit makke my bang.
A day early.	In dei betiid.
That is now well over two years old.	Dat is no goed twa jier âld.
Maybe there's nothing here.	Miskien is hjir neat.
She is the same.	Se is itselde.
It's just food.	It is gewoan iten.
He does not matter.	Hy makket neat út.
I'm happy about that.	Dêr bin ik bliid om.
It's really nice to see you here again.	It is echt moai dy hjir wer te sjen.
A new man.	In nije man.
I just decided.	Ik ha krekt besletten.
She was too scared.	Se wie te bang.
She does it.	Se docht it oan.
I have to go back to school.	Ik moat werom nei skoalle.
I think you can help me, find him yourself.	Ik tink dat jo my helpe kinne, him sels fine kinne.
That was never said.	Dat is nea sein.
I do not even know you.	Ik ken dy net iens.
They have no job to go back.	Se hawwe gjin wurk om werom te gean.
But that's not how it works.	Mar sa wurket it net.
I make them all the time.	Ik meitsje se de hiele tiid.
I need you to buy in.	Ik haw jo nedich om yn te keapjen.
I'm totally up for it.	Ik bin der hielendal op.
We're going home soon.	Wy geane gau nei hûs.
If there's anything, we'll find it.	As der wat is, fine wy ​​it.
It's just not there.	It is der gewoan net.
I need to stop talking.	Ik moat ophâlde mei praten.
Then maybe they have a chance.	Dan hawwe se miskien in kâns.
You may be surprised at what you find.	Jo kinne ferrast wurde oer wat jo fine.
If he did, he would work.	As hy it die, soe hy wurkje.
It's still true.	It is noch altyd wier.
He went straight to the mine.	Hy gie fuort nei de myn.
Also the best.	Ek de bêste.
I know where he went.	Ik wit wêr't hy gie.
So I just have to work it out.	Dat ik moat it mar wurkje.
It felt like she could see through me.	It fielde as koe se troch my hinne sjen.
This should not have worked.	Dit hie net wurkje moatten.
I'm not good at this kind of thing.	Ik bin net goed yn dit soarte dingen.
He came to my door and opened it.	Hy kaam nei myn doar en die iepen.
I know it's true.	Ik wit dat it wier is.
They were nothing of the sort.	Se wiene neat fan it soarte.
I love the idea.	Ik hâld fan it idee.
He was tired of her.	Hy hie har wurch.
Look for him.	Sjoch foar him.
Try not to find me.	Besykje my net te finen.
Nobody wanted to talk to me anymore.	Nimmen woe mear mei my prate.
And so they did.	En dat diene se.
One person dies.	Ien persoan komt om.
She wants to keep it that way.	Se wol it sa hâlde.
I'll see you tomorrow then.	Ik sjoch dy moarn dan.
That can not be so.	Dat kin net sa.
He would pay her.	Hy soe har betelje.
You need to get back to bed.	Jo moatte wer op bêd.
I'm not sure she can take it.	Ik bin der net wis fan dat se it kin nimme.
I should have taken him at his word.	Ik hie him op syn wurd nimme moatten.
He knew where he was.	Hy wist wêr't er wie.
I'll show you.	Ik sil it dy sjen litte.
I had two there.	Ik hie der twa.
He could not give them any more.	Hy koe se net mear jaan.
He did it well.	Hy die it goed.
All my family.	Al myn famylje.
And a woman's house.	En it hûs fan in frou.
Go on, feel it.	Gean troch, fiel it.
It just looked like that.	It like der krekt sa út te sjen.
Now that's gone too.	No is dat ek fuort.
I'll be in my office.	Ik sil yn myn kantoar wêze.
We will never know, and it does not matter.	Wy sille it noait witte, en it makket neat út.
Take my money.	Nim myn jild.
But we will find a way.	Mar wy sille in manier fine.
I was so tired of everything over the weekend.	Ik wie sa wurch fan alles oer it wykein.
The girl looked at her.	It famke seach har oan.
Let them do the work.	Lit har it wurk dwaan.
I just want to be alone, today.	Ik wol gewoan allinnich wêze, hjoed.
At first they did nothing.	Earst hawwe se noch neat dien.
And so he would play that.	En sa soe er dat spylje.
Now more than ever.	No mear as ea.
It was not that you could not speak.	It wie net dat jo net prate koene.
As if she was easy to get at in the first place.	As wie se yn it earste plak maklik te krijen.
Whatever it is she does.	Wat it ek is docht se.
I've never really been home.	Ik ha noait echt thús west.
Very, very well done.	Hiel, heul goed dien.
He actually does not seem to have many friends.	Hy liket eins net folle freonen te hawwen.
I had to tell her.	Ik moast it har fertelle.
Dear, good friends.	Bêste, goede freonen.
My life is still the same.	Myn libben is noch altyd itselde.
Those are all, but so much more.	Dat binne allegear, mar safolle mear.
Anything else.	Wat oars.
So many new people.	Safolle nije minsken.
I would like to believe that my mother is not like that.	Ik soe graach leauwe dat myn mem net sa is.
They are both beautiful.	Se binne beide moai.
She looked very nice.	Se seach der hiel aardich út.
The city would never go over it.	De stêd soe der noait oer gean.
But it does not work for everyone.	Mar it wurket net foar elkenien.
She will not stop worrying.	Se sil net ophâlde mei soargen te meitsjen.
I thought this might be them.	Ik tocht dat dit se wêze kinne.
I'm sick of waking up early!	Ik bin siik fan betiid wekker!
I made this house for you.	Ik makke dit hûs foar jo.
You keep me going.	Jo hâlde my oan.
He did not have to go up there.	Hy hoegde der net op te gean.
I found a seat.	Ik fûn in sit.
Everyone there agrees.	Dêr is elkenien it oer iens.
Just us.	Krekt wy.
And we're leaving.	En wy geane fuort.
But no one said anything.	Mar nimmen sei wat.
It's this time.	It is dizze kear.
But he did nothing of the sort.	Mar hy die neat fan it soarte.
Let's go see.	Lit ús gean sjen.
What does the old woman like?	Wat hâldt de âld frou?
It will always be with us.	It sil altyd by ús wêze.
His parents would know what to do.	Syn âlden soene witte wat te dwaan.
I did not have to.	Ik moast net.
We take everything you can get.	Wy nimme alles wat jo krije kinne.
I was tired that day.	Ik wie wurch dy dei.
Two on three.	Twa op trije.
This was the best time of the year.	Dit wie de bêste tiid fan it jier.
I asked her if she had been scared.	Ik frege har oft se bang west hie.
Clearly she had not expected me.	Dúdlik hie se my net ferwachte.
No one can be sure.	Nimmen kin der wis fan wêze.
Those who know it do not speak.	Dy't it witte, prate net.
He had been in the house for an hour.	Hy hie in oere yn 'e hûs west.
There's another way to see it.	D'r is in oare manier om it te sjen.
Not here, of course.	Net hjir, fansels.
There was nothing more to do than wait.	Der wie neat mear te dwaan as wachtsje.
That would be a.	Dat soe in.
Already there.	Al is der.
I just need to talk to someone.	Ik moat gewoan mei immen prate.
But it was, it had to be.	Mar it wie, it moast wêze.
I just do not know what to do.	Ik wit gewoan net wat te dwaan.
Do you mean these words?	Binne jo dizze wurden?
Makes you a new man.	Makket dy in nije man.
Everyone had their work to do.	Elkenien hie syn wurk te dwaan.
Her plan did not work.	Har plan wurke net.
This is what you do.	Dit dogge jo.
Is that he is like twice the size.	Is dat hy is as twa kear de grutte.
Everyone knows me there.	Elkenien ken my dêr.
Nobody told me how to do it.	Nimmen fertelde my hoe't ik it dwaan moast.
It works well.	It wurket goed.
It has all been.	It hat allegear west.
I was awake.	Ik wie wekker.
My family and I have concerns about him.	Ik en myn famylje hawwe har soargen oer him.
Long enough for both of us.	Lang genôch foar ús beide.
But if we do not pay him.	Mar as wy him net betelje.
He got what he wanted.	Hy krige wat er woe.
It went on for a long time.	It gie lang troch.
That's what they all need.	Dat hawwe se allegear nedich.
He needed a job.	Hy hie in baan nedich.
It really is.	It is echt.
He came and he went.	Hy kaam en hy gie.
Not anymore.	Net mear.
He must have heard.	Hy moat heard hawwe.
It looks bad, and it's bad.	It sjocht der min, en it is min.
She looks like she's up to something.	Se sjocht der út as is se oan wat.
Of course we will have to find them.	Fansels sille wy har fine moatte.
She showed me my place.	Se liet my myn plak sjen.
In fact, you can do it now.	Eins kinne jo it no dwaan.
I did nothing else.	Ik ha neat oars dien.
They had made good time.	Se hiene goed tiid makke.
He was angry at me.	Hy wie lilk op my.
Let no one take it.	Lit gjinien it nimme.
Who put it there?	Wa sette it dêr?
I do not see that as a problem.	Ik sjoch dat net as in probleem.
And we need that.	En dat hawwe wy nedich.
This is not something bad or wrong.	Dit is net wat min of ferkeard.
And she was surprised, just the same.	En se wie ferrast, krekt itselde.
You know this is wrong.	Jo witte dat dit ferkeard is.
He could not stop it.	Hy koe it net ophâlde.
We do not have that many people there.	Wy hawwe dêr net safolle minsken.
But probably few know about.	Mar wierskynlik witte in pear oer.
He was her husband.	Hy wie har man.
Maybe it would.	Miskien soe it wol.
It was not the first time.	It wie net de earste kear.
I did not want to know if he could do that.	Ik woe net witte oft er dat koe.
It could stop, of course.	It koe ophâlde, fansels.
How many of these things are there?	Hoefolle fan dizze dingen binne der?
I'm not looking at her.	Ik sjoch net nei har.
Anyone who knows anything knows that.	Elkenien dy't wat wit wit dat.
It went on and on.	It gie troch en troch.
You know you have a day.	Jo witte dat jo in dei hawwe.
See, do not talk.	Sjoch, net prate.
I look at the people around me.	Ik sjoch nei de minsken om my hinne.
You just have to ask.	Jo moatte gewoan freegje.
I did not have it hard at school.	Ik ha it net dreech op skoalle.
I need a little hand.	Ik haw in bytsje hân nedich.
Or talk about it.	Of der oer praten.
She made it for us as children.	Se makke it foar ús as bern.
I have to do another one.	Ik moat noch ien dwaan.
This should be done sooner.	Dit moat earder dien wurde.
That never happened.	Dat is nea bard.
We have to go at once.	Wy moatte yn ien kear gean.
You met my father, you heard about my mother.	Jo hawwe myn heit moete, jo hawwe oer myn mem heard.
That man is no longer my friend.	Dy man is myn freon net mear.
What's still there.	Wat hjir noch dêr is.
You will know it better than me.	Jo sille it better witte as my.
We were too.	Wy wiene ek.
Can anyone help me with this ?.	Kin immen helpe my mei dizze?.
We just need to know how to find it.	Wy moatte gewoan witte hoe't wy it fine kinne.
Which is the.	Hokker is de.
This is good.	Dit is goed.
Go away, now.	Gean fuort, no.
We talk about her life as a mother.	Wy prate oer har libben as mem.
I wonder what he thinks.	Ik freegje my ôf wat er tinkt.
You obviously need to do more.	Jo moatte fansels mear dwaan.
Would love to.	Soe graach.
She gave him some food.	Se joech him wat iten.
I could buy this.	Ik koe keapje dit.
I did not ask how long she had been there or what she wanted.	Ik frege net hoe lang se der west hie of wat se woe.
Well, that was there too.	No, dat wie der ek.
Very well done.	Hiel goed dien.
But it wants more.	Mar it wol mear.
He had to get back to work, he said.	Hy moast wer oan it wurk, sei er.
He never told it.	Hy hat it noait ferteld.
Just a man.	Krekt in man.
They were one.	Se wiene ien.
If anything, the police had found it.	As der wat te finen wie, hie de plysje it fûn.
He went home.	Hy is nei hûs gien.
That is not the question.	Dat is net de fraach.
He was a good man, and he was my friend.	Hy wie in goed man, en hy wie myn freon.
I know he's still working to take it all in.	Ik wit dat hy noch altyd wurket om alles yn te nimmen.
I did not like it so much.	Ik fûn it net sa goed.
He did not expect to find much.	Hy ferwachte net folle te finen.
Now she waited.	No wachte se.
But it's up to you.	Mar it is oan dy.
She still had no job and they still had no money.	Se hie noch gjin wurk en se hiene noch gjin jild.
Which was totally good for me.	Wat foar my hielendal goed wie.
Well, not today.	No, hjoed net.
You can not make it at home.	Jo kinne it net thús meitsje.
We need to take care.	Wy moatte soargje.
But he did not even want out.	Mar hy woe net sels út.
He's not good here.	Hy is hjir net goed.
It needs do nothing else.	It hoecht neat oars te dwaan.
Which makes me happy enough now.	Wat my no bliid genôch makket.
It's getting late.	It wurdt let.
He needed water.	Hy hie wetter nedich.
Or room mom.	Of keamer mem.
You do not have to tell anyone.	Jo hoege it net ien te fertellen.
just like that.	krekt sa.
Go out and talk about this problem.	Gean út en praat oer dit probleem.
My wife does not.	Myn frou net.
I needed a plan.	Ik hie in plan nedich.
She was what she seemed to be.	Se wie wat se like te wêzen.
And the children.	En de bern.
Just buy the book.	Keapje gewoan it boek.
It's back again.	It is wer werom.
This is very difficult for me.	Dit is hiel dreech foar my.
Can't have that.	Kin dat net hawwe.
It does not always work.	It wurket net altyd.
But she would not do it.	Mar se soe it net dwaan.
But, then.	Mar, dan.
He made me angry.	Hy makke my lilk.
And now this.	En no dit.
It felt like there was no time.	It fielde as wie der gjin tiid.
My dad just seems to be talking.	Myn heit liket gewoan te praten.
In fact, he was really looking forward to it.	Eins seach er der eins nei út.
But keep it there, girl.	Mar hâld it dêr, famke.
Or it may not happen at all.	Of it kin hielendal net barre.
Maybe things are good now.	Miskien binne dingen no goed.
He did not get out of bed for a week.	Hy kaam in wike net fan bêd.
I did not know where I was going now.	Ik wist net wêr't ik no hinne moast.
Not that you would know that.	Net dat jo dat witte soene.
There were many, many days nothing to eat.	Der wie in protte, in protte dagen neat te iten.
Her hope died.	Har hope stoar.
She looked at him.	Se seach nei him.
The other things.	De oare dingen.
He had expected it.	Hy hie it ferwachte.
Try to find out if they were still humans.	Besykje út te finen oft se noch minsken wiene.
I was just trying to help.	Ik besocht allinnich te helpen.
A lot of people.	In protte minsken.
He never even got to see it.	Hy krige it sels noait te sjen.
That was when we decided to get some help.	Dat wie doe't wy besletten om wat help.
It would be like being in bed.	It soe wêze as op bêd.
No longer clear.	Net mear dúdlik.
He had told no one anything.	Hy hie nimmen neat ferteld.
That is very clear.	Dat is hiel dúdlik.
But that just hasn’t happened yet.	Mar dat is gewoan noch net bard.
Look at the guy there.	Sjoch nei de keardel dêr.
You are my father.	Do bist myn heit.
However, it does not matter.	Hoe dan ek, it makket neat út.
No one was present.	Gjinien wie by.
Mom told me to do that.	Mem sei my dat te dwaan.
He had my mother.	Hy hie myn mem.
She knew what he was thinking.	Se wist wat er tocht.
You know nothing of why you're here.	Jo witte neat fan wêrom't jo hjir binne.
You know a lot.	Jo witte in protte.
And so far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	En oant no ta kin gjinien.
No one knew what he was thinking or who he was.	Net ien wist wat hy tocht of wa't hy wie.
We did meet, and it was good.	Wy moete wol, en it wie goed.
Who lived there.	Wa wenne dêr.
Must go now.	Moat no gean.
The thing is, it did not.	It ding is, it die net.
He just did not like it.	Hy mocht it gewoan net.
She did not find it good enough.	Se fûn it net goed genôch.
It should, too.	It moat ek.
There was no police, no one.	Der wie gjin plysje, gjinien.
If that's what you want.	As dat is wat jo wolle.
She was not sitting.	Se siet net.
He would not let them come to him.	Hy soe se net by him komme litte.
To try.	Besykje.
There was nothing he could see that he did not like.	Der wie neat dat er sjen koe dat er net leuk wie.
There was no other person to be seen.	Der wie gjin oare persoan te sjen.
You do not have to go alone.	Jo moatte net allinnich gean.
If you have one, that is.	As jo ​​​​ien hawwe, dat is.
The woman had said this.	De frou hie dit sein.
Give us that chance.	Jou ús dy kâns.
I wonder how that was.	Ik freegje my ôf hoe't dat wie.
I don't even talk to the man much.	Ik praat sels net folle mei de man.
She had to be whole.	Se moast hiel wêze.
Can't wait.	Ik kin net wachtsje.
And for another reason, too.	En om in oare reden, te.
It never needs another name.	It hat nea in oare namme nedich.
He said all the good things and said them clearly.	Hy sei alle goede dingen en sei se dúdlik.
And you have to do this the first time.	En jo moatte dit de earste kear dwaan.
We get that a lot.	Wy krije dat in protte.
With my friends.	Mei myn freonen.
This was the best thing ever.	Dit wie it bêste ding ea.
Neither was true.	Gjin fan beide wie wier.
I'm back away.	Ik werom fuort.
And in money.	En yn jild.
And they needed good people around them.	En se hiene goede minsken om har hinne nedich.
It's good to be back.	It is goed om werom te wêzen.
One of many.	Ien fan in protte.
I was determined to get there.	Ik wie besletten om dêr te kommen.
We could not do much about it now.	Dêr koene wy ​​no net folle oan dwaan.
This was the place.	Dit wie it plak.
It's not enough.	It is net genôch.
Was not so much around the room.	Wie net safolle om 'e keamer.
He knew they knew something he did not know.	Hy wist dat se wat wisten dat hy net wist.
Go to my car.	Gean nei myn auto.
Not sure if that is still the case.	Net wis oft dat noch sa is.
I would think about that.	Dêr soe ik oer tinke.
Well done, my friend, very true.	Goed dien, myn freon, heul wier.
You do not seem to be well.	Jo lykje net goed te wêzen.
We just did it.	Wy diene it gewoan.
Hope you get it.	Hoopje dat jo it krije.
I had it myself, once.	Ik hie it sels, eartiids.
You're a girl.	Do bist in famke.
He's in a good place.	Hy is op in goed plak.
It's another way of doing the same thing.	It is in oare manier om itselde ding te dwaan.
That's all it says.	Dat oer seit it allegear.
They don’t even really think about them.	Se tinke net iens echt oer har.
It just happened.	It barde gewoan.
He wondered what he would do now.	Hy frege him ôf wat er no dwaan soe.
He ate quickly.	Hy iet gau.
I hope this will help someone.	Ik hoopje dat dit immen sil helpe.
There is only food for one.	Der is mar iten foar ien.
Or for life, it seems.	Of foar it libben, liket it.
Please take care of the children.	Soargje asjebleaft foar de bern.
But this is also pretty clear.	Mar dit is ek frij dúdlik.
It did not feel right.	It fielde net goed.
I felt needed at the office.	Ik fielde my nedich op it kantoar.
Well, it should.	No, it soe moatte.
You only need a little.	Jo moatte mar in bytsje.
I do not know much about her yet.	Ik wit noch net folle oer har.
Always so round!	Altyd sa rûn!
That may seem true, but it is not.	Dat kin lykje wier, mar it is net.
I just can not have this.	Ik kin dit gewoan net hawwe.
You've been so nice to him.	Do hast sa aardich tsjin him west.
The day of the week.	De dei fan de wike.
In your time, not mine.	Yn dyn tiid, net myn.
Everything is fine on the job.	Alles is goed op 'e baan.
Not easy to find, but watch it if you can.	Net maklik te finen, mar sjoch it as jo kinne.
You are not even a man and a woman.	Do bist net iens in man en in frou.
He should have stayed and waited them out.	Hy hie bliuwe moatten en wachtsje se út.
He can not say when.	Hy kin net sizze wannear.
They want me.	Se wolle my.
I made it earlier today.	Ik makke it earder hjoed.
How does that work?	Hoe wurket dat?
The first few days it worried me.	De earste dagen makke it my soargen.
He took it for you last month.	Hy naam it foar jo ferline moanne.
To love her.	Om fan har te hâlden.
Finally.	As lêste.
She looked at his hair.	Se seach nei syn hier.
I have to tell her.	Ik moat har fertelle.
I do not indicate anything.	Ik jou der neat oan.
The same can be true for us, too.	Itselde kin wêze wier foar ús, te.
So it happened.	Sa barde it.
Give me the money.	Jou my it jild.
You just have not met them yet.	Jo hawwe se gewoan noch net moete.
As if it had been from me.	As hie it fan my west.
We'll be going back a long time.	Wy geane lang werom.
It may be where they come from.	It kin wêze wêr't se wei komme.
When he first entered the room.	Doe't er foar it earst de keamer yn kaam.
And do not regret.	En net spyt.
And though there was still much to do,	En al wie der noch in protte te dwaan,
There was something wrong.	Der wie wat net goed.
Anyway, here it goes.	Hoe dan ek, hjir giet it.
He wanted out of there.	Hy woe der út.
Wish for money.	Winskje foar jild.
Nothing we can do could not be done without us.	Neat wat wy kinne dwaan koe net dien wurde sûnder ús.
I did not expect it in a car.	Ik hie it net ferwachte yn in auto.
I'm not done with it yet.	Ik bin der noch net klear mei.
Give him the book now.	Jou him no it boek.
That you might want to buy one.	Dat jo miskien wol ien keapje.
That was the last one.	Dat wie de lêste.
Where will the money come from?	Wêr sil it jild wei komme?
You will see a bike and a car.	Jo sille in fyts en in auto sjen.
He could not stand it.	Hy koe it net oan.
We do not need any more money.	Wy hawwe gjin jild mear nedich.
I have heard both.	Ik haw beide heard.
We do not pay.	Wy betelje net.
This is too little.	Dit is te min.
I'm something else.	Ik bin wat oars.
She was good to me.	Se wie goed foar my.
He's very nice to me.	Hy is heul aardich foar my.
I do not want to be one of those people.	Ik wol net ien fan dy minsken wêze.
They were all like that.	Se wiene allegear sa.
I think so.	Ik tink it wol.
But we have found that there is plenty to do.	Mar wy hawwe fûn dat der genôch te dwaan is.
It would not stay that way for long.	It soe net lang sa bliuwe.
She asked where his new name came from.	Se frege wêr't syn nije namme wei kaam.
She did it well.	Se die it goed.
There was back and forth.	Der wie hinne en wer.
He would like us to think there is time.	Hy soe graach wolle dat wy tinke dat der tiid is.
Make sure	Wis wêze
More very one way or another.	Mear hiel ien of oare manier.
They are afraid that this may be the last time.	Se binne bang dat dit de lêste kear wêze kin.
I'm sorry for nothing.	It spyt my fan neat.
The kids can not do it.	De bern kinne it net.
I really needed that.	Dat hie ik echt nedich.
If you do not get the job done, they will get you.	As jo ​​​​it wurk net dien krije, dan krije se jo.
There are things you can not do, no matter how much you want to.	D'r binne dingen dy't jo net kinne dwaan, hoefolle jo ek wolle.
We will have children.	Wy sille bern krije.
It will help us.	It sil ús helpe.
They think they have their husband.	Se tinke dat se har man hawwe.
He said nothing of what he had seen.	Hy sei neat fan wat er sjoen hie.
You will never get out of your car.	Jo sille noait út jo auto komme.
Not just one other person, either.	Net allinnich ien oare persoan, ek.
She wants you.	Se wol dy.
You live in the house, you stay away from people.	Jo wenje yn 'e hûs, jo bliuwe fuort fan minsken.
There is no chance.	Der is gjin kâns.
It almost felt like back in school.	It fielde hast as werom op skoalle.
He got busy reading.	Hy krige it drok mei it lêzen.
when.	wannear.
She was not there.	Se wie der net by.
There needed to be more.	Der moast mear by.
You did your time, as it were.	Do hast dyn tiid dien, as it wie.
I will not believe this yet.	Ik sil dit noch net leauwe.
Everything was in there.	Alles siet der yn.
But something is holding me back.	Mar wat hâldt my tsjin.
The reason is this.	De reden is dit.
This is exactly what happened here.	Dit is krekt wat hjir barde.
I had no money.	Ik hie gjin jild.
She would do anything for you.	Se soe alles foar dy dwaan.
And we would love to see you together.	En wy wolle jo graach tegearre sjen.
Not one of us has anything left.	Net ien fan ús hat wat oer.
There is hope.	Der is hope.
Same as you.	Itselde as dy.
He walks away.	Hy giet fuort.
That can not be.	Dat kin net.
Do everything to get back there.	Doch alles om dêr werom te kommen.
I can not say when.	Ik kin net sizze wannear.
The time was mine.	De tiid wie myn.
Or they can be.	Of se kinne wêze.
I'm all alone here.	Ik bin hjir hielendal allinnich.
That tells us two things.	Dat seit ús twa dingen.
I've seen them before.	Dy haw ik earder sjoen.
But even that was not all.	Mar ek dat wie net alles.
I had never seen him like this before.	Ik hie him noch noait sa sjoen.
It's so real.	It is sa echt.
I do not know what's wrong with me.	Ik wit net wat der mei my oan de hân is.
They love you.	Se hâlde fan dy.
More questions?	Mear fragen?
It may or may not be the truth.	It kin of miskien net de wierheid wêze.
And that was easy money.	En dat wie maklik jild.
You are ready to go.	Jo binne dúdlik om te gean.
I really can.	Ik kin echt.
In a year we are ready.	Oer in jier binne wy ​​klear.
All the things they were out for.	Alle dingen se wiene út.
When he did, he came away.	As er it die, kaam er fuort.
This does not apply.	Dit hâldt net yn.
Soon we were ready to make everything ourselves.	Al gau wiene wy ​​ree om alles sels te meitsjen.
I know you'll get angry.	Ik wit dat jo lilk wurde.
I became a person who is not me.	Ik waard in persoan dy't my net bin.
Everything seemed to be in place now.	Alles like no op syn plak te wêzen.
It seems like a good time to go inside.	It liket in goede tiid om yn te gean.
The last time he was here, he was very ill.	De lêste kear dat er hjir wie, wie er tige siik.
They wish it would go away.	Se winskje dat it fuort soe.
He now lives with his mother, he looks after her.	Hy wennet no by syn mem, hy sjocht nei har.
He looked at me.	Hy seach nei my.
That was me three months ago.	Dat wie ik trije moanne lyn.
She's old now.	Se is no âld.
You do the best you can, and hope.	Jo dogge it bêste dat jo kinne, en hoopje.
Can take.	Kin nimme.
Other than that, this one does it.	Oars as dat, dit docht it.
Maybe it was so.	Miskien wie it sa.
I know there is a chance.	Ik wit dat dêr in kâns op is.
It all started with one man's work.	It begûn allegear mei ien man syn wurk.
You can not see it.	Jo kinne it net sjen.
I see it now.	Ik sjoch it no.
It was just so much money.	It wie krekt safolle jild.
Do not tell her.	Fertel it har net.
They would see him all the time.	Se soene him de hiele tiid sjen.
What you do, and who you are.	Wat jo dogge, en wa't jo binne.
But it scared me.	Mar it makke my bang.
But it's fun.	Mar it is leuk.
I was in it clearly.	Ik wie yn it dúdlik.
Children need to put things back in place.	Bern moatte dingen wer op har plak sette.
No one ran.	Gjinien rûn.
I hope they win.	Ik hoopje dat se winne.
I will pay you back.	Ik sil dy werom betelje.
He knew they were.	Hy wist dat se wiene.
Without it, nothing much would happen.	Sûnder soe neat in protte barre.
We just have to.	Wy moatte gewoan.
And he needed me.	En hy hie my nedich.
They knew what to do.	Se wisten wat te dwaan.
But we get there now.	Mar wy komme der no.
If you want.	As jo ​​wolle.
That's his job.	Dat is syn wurk.
I'm glad it did.	Ik bin bliid dat it dien hat.
I had to.	Ik moast.
I can do nothing.	Ik kin neat dwaan.
It was just what it was.	It wie krekt wat it wie.
He looks good.	Hy sjocht der goed út.
She said she would talk to her husband first.	Se sei dat se earst mei har man prate soe.
She was alone.	Se wie allinnich.
She should have the opportunity to talk to him.	Se soe de kâns hâlde moatte om mei him te praten.
She would not hurt me, she loves me.	Se soe my net sear dwaan, se hâldt fan my.
She must be on time.	Se moat op tiid wêze.
He did not expect that.	Dat hie er net ferwachte.
Would not.	Soe net.
Or something like that.	Of wat der op like.
Are the best.	Binne de bêste.
People say it will be clear.	Minsken sizze dat it dúdlik sil wêze.
This kind, sure, of all.	Dizze soarte, wis, fan allegear.
For him.	Foar him.
It would be nice to help someone.	It soe leuk wêze om immen te helpen.
Take a seat, my husband.	Nim in sit, myn man.
I can not take anyone now.	Ik kin no gjinien nimme.
But they are gone now.	Mar se binne no fuort.
He knows he could never win.	Hy wit dat hy noait winne koe.
She really knows me.	Se ken my echt.
Maybe you should tell him something.	Miskien soene jo him wat sizze.
She did not want to see her now.	Se woe har no net sjen.
Was that not the truth.	Wie dat net de wierheid.
Already from an early age.	Al fan betiid ôf.
But she can do nothing about it.	Mar dêr kin se neat oan dwaan.
And so they go on.	En sa geane se ek troch.
He's coming back.	Hy komt werom.
This guy saw this girl at a party.	Dizze keardel seach dit famke op in feest.
Do not know her name yet.	Wit har namme noch net.
I have not heard anything about this.	Ik haw hjir neat oer heard.
Not so long ago.	Net sa lang lyn.
I do not know what to do with him.	Ik wit net wat ik mei him dwaan moat.
My friends haven't seen him in a week.	Myn freonen hawwe him al in wike net sjoen.
Yours is so beautiful.	Dyn is sa moai.
His whole life for him.	Syn hiele libben foar him.
She had never been so beautiful.	Se hie noch noait sa moai west.
They do it for money.	Se dogge it foar jild.
I could not do that at all.	Dat koe ik hielendal net.
Why, in my day.	Wêrom, yn myn dei.
They were so nice.	Se wiene sa aardich.
The old man was surprised.	De âld man wie ferrast.
They are many.	Se binne in protte.
Time to get to work.	Tiid om oan it wurk te kommen.
Not for long.	Lang net.
To all the people who have tried it.	Oan alle minsken dy't it besocht hawwe.
I will try to stay out of your way.	Ik sil besykje út jo wei te bliuwen.
He would not tell anyone what he had seen all week.	Hy soe gjinien fertelle wat er in hiele wike sjoen hie.
Not one of us would.	Net ien fan ús soe.
There's her friend.	Dêr is har freon.
Not sure if it did.	Net wis oft it die.
Where were we?	Wer wiene wy?
He was too nice to me.	Hy wie te aardich foar my.
It is now or never.	It is no of nea.
I know it's going to be hard to talk about.	Ik wit dat it dreech wêze sil om oer te praten.
I would not think it was true.	Ik soe net tinke dat it wier wie.
I very much agree with that.	Ik bin it der tige mei iens.
A few years ago he visited my house.	In pear jier lyn besocht hy myn hûs.
He knew it was not about him.	Hy wist dat it net oer him gie.
You have not heard anything yet.	Jo hawwe noch neat heard.
I had a letter from him.	Ik hie in brief fan him.
That's where we are.	Dat is wêr't wy binne.
But there is no reason.	Mar der is gjin reden.
Would not tell me what he found.	Soe my net fertelle wat er fûn.
We do not know.	Wy witte it net.
There can be no better time than now.	Der kin gjin bettere tiid as no.
I want to be with you.	Ik wol mei dy.
She wants nothing more to do with him.	Se wol neat mear mei him te krijen hawwe.
They do not like to talk about it.	Se prate der net graach oer.
Just do it.	Doch it gewoan.
Must help a lot.	Moat in protte helpe.
He's out to that.	Dêr is er nei út.
It's good, good that she's here.	It is goed, goed dat se hjir is.
She never heard from her husband once.	Se hearde nea ien kear fan har man.
Today it is not either.	Hjoed is it ek net.
No one is there.	Gjinien is der.
The problems started last month.	De problemen begûn ferline moanne.
That's not just.	Dat is net gewoan.
I'm not a bad boy.	Ik bin gjin minne jonge.
Whatever it was, this man was not.	Wat it ek wie, dizze man wie it net.
It's in the making.	It is yn it dwaan.
But he will not come for them.	Mar hy sil net foar har komme.
It's just fine.	It is krekt goed.
You just can not see them.	Jo kinne se gewoan net sjen.
Tell me what you think.	Fertel my wat jo tinke.
We need to talk to her about that.	Dêr moatte wy mei har oer prate.
She wants to hurt her.	Se wol har sear dwaan.
There must be something wrong with the mother.	Der moat wat oan de hân wêze mei de mem.
He came home to find his wife happy.	Hy kaam thús om syn frou bliid te finen.
The kind you need from a good friend.	It soarte dat jo nedich hawwe fan in goede freon.
Must have a car.	Moatte in auto hawwe.
He just did not know how to look at it.	Hy wist gewoan net hoe't er it sjen moast.
This is what we want to do about it.	Dit is wat wy der oan dwaan wolle.
On that day there was also full moon.	Op dy dei wie der ek folle moanne.
She did not know what was needed.	Se wist net wat der nedich wie.
The couple had no children.	It pear hie gjin bern.
He just can not help her.	Hy kin har gewoan net helpe.
Ask for help.	Om help freegje.
I've had enough of it.	Ik haw it genôch hân.
It was just about tomorrow.	It wie krekt oer moarn.
He now felt another person.	Hy fielde no in oare persoan.
There is a lot about this today.	D'r is hjoed in protte oer dit.
Told me.	Fertelde my.
Let me know if you are interested.	Lit my witte as jo ynteressearre binne.
Everyone deals with this differently.	Elkenien giet hjir oars mei om.
He knew no one there.	Hy koe dêr gjinien.
It works, and it works well.	It wurket, en it wurket goed.
I was able to get it to work so far.	Ik koe it oant no ta oan it wurk krije.
What they should do next.	Wat se moatte dwaan folgjende.
You are not me.	Do bist my net.
Here it comes.	Hjir komt it.
She would not be able to hold me for long.	Se soe my net lang hâlde kinne.
It does not.	It docht net.
If he wanted to, he could get away from this whole thing.	As er woe, koe er fan dit hiele ding ôf komme.
It's the right thing to do.	It is it goede ding om te dwaan.
And there was something.	En der wie wat.
I must say.	Ik moat sizze.
Before his time ran out.	Foardat syn tiid rûn.
There is food and water.	Der is iten en wetter.
But there's no way that's going to happen to me.	Mar d'r is gjin kâns dat dat bart foar my.
Of course he did not.	Dat hie er fansels net.
They need to work.	Se moatte wurkje.
And there was so much he wanted to say.	En der wie safolle dat er sizze woe.
You're doing well.	Dat dogge jo goed.
Not a good day for our kids, either.	Gjin goede dei foar ús bern, op ien of oare manier.
I always have.	Ik haw altyd.
What it is I am.	Wat dit ek is.
Someone has to do it.	Immen moat it dwaan.
I'll be fine.	Ik sil it goed ha.
I want you to come with me.	Ik wol dat jo mei my komme.
You speak clearly and well.	Jo prate dúdlik en goed.
Can anyone help me.	Kin immen my helpe.
Think of you and your family.	Tink oan dy en dyn famylje.
I do not know when.	Ik wit net wannear.
I think he's there.	Ik tink dat hy der is.
It just seemed like it.	It like gewoan.
She had never been back.	Se wie nea werom west.
Of course,.	Fansels,.
I knew him now.	Ik koe him no.
We were beautiful.	Wy wiene moai.
This woman looks tired.	Dizze frou sjocht wurch.
Whatever the reason, no one thought.	Wat de reden ek wie, gjinien tocht.
It worked well.	It hat goed wurke.
He's doing well.	Hy komt wol goed.
It could.	It soe kinne.
Please, you have to believe me.	Asjebleaft, jo moatte my leauwe.
Sure, he did not have one.	Wis, hy hie gjin ien.
Not if you take his name.	Net as jo syn namme nimme.
There was too much going on for me to leave.	Der barde te folle foar my om fuort te gean.
But there was no one to see me.	Mar der wie gjinien om my te sjen.
Come home to your family.	Kom thús nei jo famylje.
But she had no idea where he was.	Mar se hie gjin idee wêr't er wie.
It's not the last either.	It is ek net de lêste.
We are also committed to being here for you.	Wy sette ús ek yn om hjir foar jo te wêzen.
I'm sure it's her.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it har is.
He said nothing.	Hy sei neat.
So glad you're with us today.	Sa bliid dat jo hjoed by ús binne.
And I know a lot about it.	En ik wit der in protte oer.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Oant no hat gjinien.
I went through the city or town.	Ik gie troch de stêd of stêd.
He took me out to dinner.	Hy naam my mei út te iten.
We can talk more tomorrow.	Wy kinne moarn mear prate.
It's much the same.	It is in protte itselde.
They are not alone either.	Se binne ek net allinnich.
Same for everyone, really.	Itselde foar elkenien, echt.
He did not know how he got there.	Hy wist net hoe't er dêr kaam.
And he will always be.	En hy sil altyd wêze.
I did not ask for the job.	Ik haw net frege om de baan.
We know he loves his job.	Wy witte dat hy fan syn wurk hâldt.
I love that girl.	Ik hâld fan dat famke.
Those are the things you should always do.	Dat binne de dingen dy't jo altyd moatte dwaan.
There was little to say.	Der wie min te sizzen.
Book of life.	Boek fan it libben.
It seems to hold up well.	It liket goed te hâlden.
She looked at him.	Se seach him oan.
She took place.	Se naam plak.
That's exactly what he did.	Dat is krekt wat hy die.
All this will take time.	Dit alles sil tiid nimme.
He had kept a few things for me.	Hy hie in pear dingen foar my hâlden.
I'm sure they do not let them.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se har net litte.
I heard it said that	Ik haw it sein dat heard
No idea if he's even trying to help her.	Gjin idee oft hy sels besykje har te helpen.
Neither seemed happy to see him.	Gjin fan beide like bliid om him te sjen.
There was something left.	Der bleau wat oer.
I do not know how many days it was.	Ik wit net hoefolle dagen it wie.
They did not expect that.	Dat hiene se net ferwachte.
There would be no talking.	Der soe gjin praat wurde.
And whatever happened in there.	En wat der ek yn bard is.
Sure enough, it did.	Wis genôch, it die.
This book was given to me by a friend.	Dit boek is my jûn troch in freon.
Do not be angry.	Wês net lilk.
We come to you.	Wy komme by dy.
There is so little else that they go.	Der is sa'n bytsje oars dat se gean.
It was a very bad time for me.	It wie in hiele minne tiid foar my.
I can not say that.	Dat kin ik net sizze.
He had the opportunity to.	Hy hie de kâns om.
He was just a child.	Hy wie mar in bern.
I see nothing else.	Ik sjoch neat oars.
Nothing happened to the man.	Der barde neat mei de man.
That's me in the picture.	Dat bin ik dêr op de foto.
I'm just worried.	Ik bin gewoan soargen.
If you want to go, go.	As jo ​​​​gean wolle, gean dan.
We've never even seen another movie together.	Wy hawwe noait sels in oare film tegearre sjoen.
He was always an early child.	Hy wie altyd in betiid bern.
There is nothing left.	Der is neat oer.
I never thought of that.	Dêr tocht ik noait oan.
And he got me some.	En hy krige ek wat.
Get me ready for tomorrow.	Meitsje my op foar moarn.
Take my Hand.	Nim myn Hân.
But make sure you know what you are doing and why.	Mar wês wis dat jo witte wat jo dogge en wêrom.
Just more so.	Krekt mear sa.
For a long time nothing happened.	Lang is der neat bard.
There is no need to say that.	D'r is net nedich om dat iens te sizzen.
She was kind to me.	Se wie aardich tsjin my.
I knew he was coming.	Ik wist dat hy komme soe.
But it is also about much more than that.	Mar it giet ek om folle mear as dat.
We need to be afraid that we can become you.	Wy moatte bang wêze dat wy jo wurde kinne.
I just thought.	Ik tocht gewoan.
We just could not help it.	Wy koene it gewoan net helpe.
They just want to be heard.	Se wolle gewoan heard wurde.
But enough of me.	Mar genôch fan my.
First pour some water into the bowl.	Giet earst wat wetter yn 'e kom.
I can not find it.	Ik kin it net fine.
You can just tell by looking at them.	Jo kinne gewoan fertelle troch har te sjen.
I love this so much.	Ik hâld fan dizze sa folle.
No one will do our work for us.	Nimmen sil ús wurk foar ús dwaan.
I talk a lot.	Ik praat in protte.
I never see it until it's right for me.	Ik sjoch it noait oant it krekt foar my is.
I get there or not.	Ik kom der wol of net.
That is not yet clear.	Dat is noch net dúdlik.
You pay first.	Jo betelje earst.
And try he did.	En besykje hy die.
You can not see them.	Jo kinne se net sjen.
I said he was no more.	Ik sei dat er net mear wie.
He and his wife have two children.	Hy en syn frou hawwe twa bern.
I just felt too good.	Ik fielde my gewoan te goed.
You eat it.	Jo yt it.
Another day that becomes clear will not be so easy.	In oare dei dat dúdlik wurde sil net sa maklik wurde.
She does not speak.	Se praat net.
I did not like it.	Ik hie it net leuk.
Of his children.	Fan syn bern.

I liked that a lot.	Dat fûn ik in protte leuk.
He will not hurt you.	Hy sil dy net sear dwaan.
I want you to show me.	Ik wol dat jo my sjen litte.
We're just ready here.	Wy binne hjir krekt klear.
We have to leave them at the door.	Wy moatte se by de doar litte.
There's nothing here.	D'r is hjir neat.
To a guy.	Oan in keardel.
He did not feel well.	Hy fielde him net goed.
There is not enough of that.	Dêr is net genôch fan.
It's going well with us.	It komt goed mei ús.
Maybe she had been wrong.	Miskien hie se ferkeard west.
There were no children.	Der wiene gjin bern.
She really came up with him.	Se kaam echt op mei him.
And true, more than not.	En wier, mear as net.
It's good to see you again.	It is goed dy wer te sjen.
They were all waiting.	Se wachte allegear.
He's really nice.	Hy is echt aardich.
This is obviously not true.	Dit is fansels net wier.
They are given by.	Se wurde jûn troch.
But he could not find one.	Mar hy koe net ien fine.
The man he had just seen days ago.	De man dy't er krekt dagen lyn sjoen hie.
I saw him at the party.	Ik seach him op it feest.
She was not yet ready to oppose him.	Se wie noch net ree om him tsjin te gean.
I think of my wife and children.	Ik tink oan myn frou en bern.
Not to be found.	Gjin te finen.
Take a seat.	Nim in sit.
But that is not true.	Mar dat is net wier.
They were on us.	Se wiene op ús.
There's some truth in what she's saying.	D'r is wat wierheid yn wat se seit.
It's so easy to read.	It is sa'n maklik lêzen.
But it will require hard work.	Mar it sil hurd wurk nedich wêze.
Tom works hard.	Tom wurket hurd.
That must be so.	Dat moat sa wêze.
We can not stop now.	Wy kinne no net ophâlde.
Of course we can not.	Fansels kinne wy ​​net.
It's very good.	It is hiel goed.
Had nothing to do with it.	Hie der neat mei te krijen.
But this time it will not be so easy.	Mar dizze kear sil it net sa maklik wêze.
That's exactly how our family works.	Dat is krekt hoe ús famylje wurket.
But for now, what you do is very good.	Mar foar no, wat jo dogge is hiel goed.
You would not want to be there.	Jo soene der net wolle wêze.
But somehow it didn’t look right.	Mar op ien of oare manier like it net goed.
He looked around but could not see it.	Hy seach om him hinne, mar koe it net sjen.
Do not do this again.	Doch dit net wer.
First you need to know how to get there.	Earst moatte jo witte hoe't jo dêr komme kinne.
Nothing of the sort.	Neat fan dat soarte.
We have a day of hard work ahead of us.	Wy hawwe in dei fan hurd wurk foar ús.
Asked earlier.	Earder frege.
It's like forever.	It is as foar altyd.
You get it.	Jo krije it.
He has worked hard to find a new job.	Hy hat hurd wurke om in nije baan te finen.
This was not at all like watching a movie.	Dit wie hielendal net as it sjen fan in film.
She walked into the room, and there he was.	Se rûn de keamer yn, en dêr wie er.
He did not ask her once.	Hy hat har net ien kear frege.
Children get sick.	Bern wurde siik.
There was something going on.	Der wie wat oan de hân.
And she looks good.	En se sjocht der goed út.
But eat now.	Mar yt no.
He had a wife and children.	Hy hie in frou en bern.
He knew he could do it alone.	Hy wist dat er allinnich koe.
But first she asked how it was with him.	Mar earst frege se hoe't it mei him hie.
You never come here.	Jo komme hjir noait.
He speaks very, very well.	Hy prate hiel, hiel goed.
She was the last child of her family.	Se wie it lêste bern fan har famylje.
I'll find a place to stay tonight.	Ik sil fannacht in plak fine om te bliuwen.
There will be a lot of people there.	Dêr sille in protte minsken wêze.
He should be home by now.	Hy soe no thús wêze moatte.
Said he came across this way himself.	Sei hy kaam oer dizze manier sels.
Not in those words.	Net yn dy wurden.
She has been since.	Se hat sûnt west.
Of course you know.	Fansels witte jo.
I hope they would not find out.	Ik hope dat se it der net út fine soene.
They were not her.	Se wiene har net.
Now that would never happen.	No soe dat noait barre.
It was nice what he did.	It wie moai wat hy die.
I never liked her.	Ik mocht har noait leuk fine.
I do not want this to ever happen.	Ik wol net dat dit ea bart.
One more time.	Noch ien kear.
It had not seen me.	It hie my net sjoen.
I needed another way.	Ik hie in oare manier nedich.
And maybe it was that.	En miskien wie it dat.
Talking is hard.	Praten is dreech.
She was so scared that she told me everything.	Se wie sa bang, dat se fertelde my alles.
I did not want anyone else.	Ik woe net ien oars.
So he would say it.	Sa soe er it sizze.
Not one of us would have.	Net ien fan ús soe hawwe.
But it's not true.	Mar it is net wier.
You will never leave it.	Jo sille it noait litte.
In fact, it does not need as much as you might think.	Eins hat it net safolle nedich as jo tinke kinne.
Also through us.	Ek troch ús hinne.
It's just this.	It is gewoan dit.
I do not believe that anymore.	Dat leau ik net mear.
That you do not know what it is that you know.	Dat jo net witte wat it is dat jo witte.
Was that.	Wie dat.
Of course we did not.	Dat diene wy ​​fansels net.
She did not know what to say to him.	Se wist net wat se tsjin him sizze moast.
I just had no idea what to do with her.	Ik hie gewoan gjin idee wat ik mei har dwaan moast.
Without it, a woman is nothing.	Sûnder it is in frou neat.
I want to help you get better.	Ik wol jo helpe om better te wurden.
Maybe there was something to it.	Miskien wie der wat oan.
But they can not.	Mar se kinne net.
I saw that in a movie.	Ik seach dat yn in film.
Otherwise there was a problem.	Oars wie der in probleem.
Why are you always angry?	Wêrom bist altyd lilk?
We have time.	Wy hawwe tiid.
He could no longer.	Hy koe net mear.
He did not even see me there.	Hy seach my dêr net iens.
My mother did not want us.	Myn mem woe ús net.
He did not think so either.	Hy tocht ek net.
Very nice for the first time.	Hiel moai foar de earste kear.
I think you know where this is going.	Ik tink dat jo witte wêr't dit hinne giet.
There are two major concerns.	D'r binne twa grutte soargen.
I will not even try it.	Ik sil it net iens besykje.
It was really, really hard.	It wie echt echt dreech.
I was very.	Ik wie tige.
He is your friend.	Hy is dyn freon.
She said nothing of it, to me.	Se sei der neat fan, tsjin my.
This does nothing.	Dit docht neat.
I want you.	Ik wol dy.
As if she had him.	As soe se him hawwe.
I really am not.	Ik bin echt net.
I already felt better.	Ik fielde my al better.
I did more than that.	Ik die mear as dat.
I love school.	Ik hâld fan skoalle.
The moon is now clearly visible.	De moanne is no dúdlik te sjen.
And to take her away so soon after finding her.	En om har sa gau nei it finen fan har fuort te nimmen.
I'm not there yet.	Ik bin der noch net.
I'm glad to see you.	Ik bin bliid dy te sjen.
I'm leaving.	Ik gean fuort.
This is why we're here tonight.	Dit is wêrom wy hjir fannacht binne.
He would have to go to her.	Hy soe nei har ta moatte.
I can not wait for next year to see these friends again.	Ik kin net wachtsje op takom jier om dizze freonen wer te sjen.
He would get there.	Hy soe der komme.
They should be told.	Se soene ferteld wurde moatte.
It will come to me.	It sil by my komme.
The mother looks on.	De mem sjocht nei.
All, all mine.	Allegear, allegear myn.
It can happen again.	It kin wer barre.
Go and see them.	Gean en sjoch se.
Be very careful.	Wês tige foarsichtich.
So it goes on.	Sa giet it troch.
This is her first year.	Dit is har earste jier.
Stop it, my wife.	Hâld op, myn frou.
He looked after it well.	Hy seach der goed nei.
I've only had it for a month.	Ik haw it mar in moanne hân.
More than she wants.	Mear as se wol.
I want to.	Ik wol.
Everyone had it.	Elkenien hie it.
This strikes me.	Dit komt my oan.
They are the children.	It binne de bern.
We wish it had not happened.	Wy winskje dat it net bard wie.
You have to stop.	Jo moatte ophâlde.
And they will not play hard for you.	En se sille net hurd foar jo spylje.
Who knew, probably the se.	Wa wist, wierskynlik die se.
Her boy has become my husband.	Har jonge is myn man wurden.
She said this could not be true.	Se sei dat dit net wier wêze koe.
What happens next has nothing to do with me.	Wat der fan bart, hat neat mei my te krijen.
Do not wait for me.	Wachtsje net op my.
It's home.	It is thús.
I was home.	Ik wie thús.
But you will take it.	Mar jo sille it nimme.
That was your job.	Dat wie dyn wurk.
A little, nothing more.	In bytsje, neat mear.
I ask that you do not make it necessary.	Ik freegje dat jo dat net nedich meitsje.
Just to be clear.	Krekt om dúdlik te wêzen.
I'll make some money for you.	Ik sil wat jild foar dy meitsje.
They were fun to be around.	Se wiene leuk om te wêzen.
You're tired.	Do bist wurch.
And I did.	En dat die ik.
He looked at me.	Hy seach nei my.
Tell me she was scared.	Fertel my dat se bang wie.
Would it be so.	Soe it sa wêze.
This is very common.	Dit is hiel gewoan.
But he did not know everything.	Mar hy wist net alles.
Maybe she had.	Miskien hie se.
And, it looks like they'll do it again.	En, it liket derop dat se dat wer dogge.
It made me want to see you for the first time.	It makke my dy foar it earst te sjen.
Your kids need to come first.	Jo bern moatte earst komme.
I want you to have a chance to go back.	Ik wol dat jo in kâns hawwe om werom te gean.
The new.	De nije.
But maybe not for long.	Mar miskien net lang.
There were, of course, problems.	Der wiene fansels problemen.
You're doing the right thing.	Jo dogge it goede ding.
We're in it together.	Wy binne der tegearre yn.
That just will not work.	Dat sil gewoan net wurkje.
I wonder what happened to you.	Ik freegje my ôf wat der mei dy bard is.
She had the door open when he got there.	Se hie de doar iepen doe't er dêr kaam.
Everything is getting better after this weekend.	Alles wurdt better nei dit wykein.
Something felt off.	Der fielde wat ôf.
She could see it right now.	Se koe it no krekt sjen.
She looked around the room.	Se seach de keamer om.
I'm a little tired and I do not feel too good.	Ik bin wat wurch en fiel my net al te goed.
He was not yet a year old.	Hy wie noch gjin jier âld.
You never have to get out.	Jo hoege noait út te kommen.
Only this week !.	Allinnich dizze wike!.
I'm over it now though.	Ik bin der no wol oer.
I'll get over this soon.	Ik kom dit gau oer.
But it was so clear.	Mar it wie sa dúdlik.
What the say.	Wat die se.
I took my time eating.	Ik naam myn tiid it iten.
No one ever gave me as much as you.	Nimmen joech my oait safolle as jo.
I do not want to know.	Ik wol it net witte.
Do it as often as you can.	Doch it sa faak as jo kinne.
It was as if they had no money at all.	It wie as hiene se hielendal gjin jild.
And he was nice.	En hy wie aardich.
I told him thirty.	Ik fertelde him tritich.
I did.	Dat die ik.
But here are problems.	Mar hjir binne problemen.
he said.	hy sei.
I do not speak alone.	Ik praat net allinnich.
Think of your best friend.	Tink oan jo bêste freon.
We have not tried that yet.	Dat hawwe wy noch net besocht.
Be carefull.	Wês foarsichtich.
And we both love you more than ever.	En wy hâlde beide fan dy mear as ea.
He lets you come to us.	Hy lit dy by ús komme.
Well, that does not work.	No, dat giet net.
He will need that wherever he goes.	Hy sil dat nedich wêze wêr't er hinne giet.
That's how it felt.	Sa fielde it wol.
He sat and he waited.	Hy siet en hy wachte.
So far, so good.	Oant no ta wurket alles goed.
I'm still not sure how.	Ik bin noch net wis hoe.
And we got the chance to tell it.	En wy krigen de kâns om it te fertellen.
They were not even the same kind.	Se wiene net iens deselde soarte.
I must be sick.	Ik moat siik wêze.
One month and no more.	Ien moanne en net mear.
Now look at what you have done.	Sjoch no wat jo dien hawwe.
That can do it.	Dat kin it dwaan.
That's my way of getting back to him.	Dat is myn manier om by him werom te kommen.
It would not take much.	It soe net folle nimme.
You work really hard.	Jo wurkje echt hurd.
Just like they do.	Krekt as se dogge.
She could not be thirty years old.	Se koe gjin tritich jier wêze.
Maybe that was good.	Miskien wie dat goed.
And it had to be asked.	En it moast frege wurde.
I'm out of here.	Ik bin hjir wei.
My family could not believe it.	Myn famylje koe it net leauwe.
I need to tell you something.	Ik moat dy wat fertelle.
There was something wrong.	Der wie wol wat.
He walked away as if he was coming back.	Hy gie fuort as kaam er werom.
It could not hurt to be careful, he thought.	It koe gjin sear om foarsichtich te wêzen, tocht er.
There was nothing more for him to surrender.	Der wie neat mear foar him oer te jaan.
He's pretty good.	Hy is aardich goed.
I tried it that way but could not do it.	Ik besocht it op dy manier, mar koe it net dwaan.
Not that it ever should have, but it did.	Net dat it ea moatten hie, mar it die.
Talk to someone.	Praat mei immen.
They will not take it.	Se sille it net nimme.
A scared child.	In bang bern.
He could do nothing to stop it.	Hy koe neat dwaan om it tsjin te hâlden.
I knew she had.	Ik wist dat se hie.
A little late.	In bytsje let.
I think it might just work.	Ik tink dat it gewoan kin wurkje.
But it was a good movie.	Mar it wie in goede film.
So they were more than ready to make it happen.	Sa wiene se mear as ree om it barre te meitsjen.
They will not work.	Se sille net wurkje.
I just could not do it.	Ik koe it gewoan net dwaan.
But when it's our home, our children, whatever.	Mar as it ús thús is, ús bern, wat dan ek.
I did not think it would be so.	Ik tocht net dat it sa wêze soe.
But let the boy go.	Mar lit de jonge gean.
What he knew was that it was real.	Wat hy wist is dat it echt wie.
My dad couldn’t either, and he sat in there.	Myn heit koe ek net, en hy siet der yn.
That's not why you're here.	Dat is net wêrom't jo hjir binne.
I love you and will always love you.	Ik hâld fan dy en sil altyd fan dy hâlde.
If not, wait until he does.	As net, wachtsje oant hy docht.
And it's pretty ordinary.	En it is frij gewoan.
That's exactly what we did.	Dat is krekt wat wy dien hawwe.
That's what it's for.	Dêr is it foar.
He seemed really nice.	Hy like echt aardich.
He always says that.	Dat seit er altyd.
He wanted her to say something, whatever it was.	Hy woe dat se wat sei, wat it ek wie.
And so we are a new man.	En sa binne wy ​​in nije man.
It's just that we are.	It is gewoan dat wy binne.
Water of life itself.	Wetter fan it libben sels.
These people can look nice and worried.	Dizze minsken kinne sjen aardich en soargen.
It's just as well that he did.	It is like goed dat hy die.
I am sorry.	It spyt my.
Get out of here.	Gean hjir wei.
But it was actually very good.	Mar it wie eins hiel goed.
You only get one life.	Jo krije mar ien libben.
I've told you before.	Ik haw it dy earder sein.
I'm trying to.	Ik besykje om.
She's coming this weekend to help me.	Se komt dit wykein om my te helpen.
Let's have a word with him.	Lit ús in wurd mei him hawwe.
He put the work in.	Hy sette it wurk yn.
Back to work.	Wer oan it wurk.
I wonder where it came from.	Ik freegje my ôf wêr't it wei kaam.
And so she waited.	En sa wachte se.
I love these things.	Ik hâld fan dizze dingen.
She began to worry.	Se begûn har soargen te meitsjen.
We need help.	Wy moatte help krije.
It happened.	It barde.
I was so busy at work today.	Ik wie hjoed sa drok op it wurk.
But not your father.	Mar dyn heit net.
We can only help each other a little.	Wy kinne elkoar mar in bytsje helpe.
I could not hold them.	Ik koe se net hâlde.
The problems were real.	De problemen wiene echt.
He knew them both.	Hy koe se beide.
He was old enough to be the father of the child.	Hy wie âld genôch om de heit fan it bern te wêzen.
I would love to do it this way.	Ik sil graach dwaan it op dizze manier.
I want to see you.	Ik wol dy komme sjen.
The boy's driving did not scare me.	It riden fan de jonge makke my net bang.
She would be just fine.	Se soe wêze gewoan goed.
I already have enough money.	Ik haw al genôch jild.
What are your other three days.	Wat binne dyn oare trije dagen.
She has another day to go.	Se moat noch in dei tsjin.
Good on the water too.	Goed op it wetter ek.
But we need help.	Mar wy moatte help krije.
Otherwise you will get tired.	Oars wurde jo wurch.
I think you've met him before.	Ik tink dat jo him earder moete hawwe.
Many were worried.	In protte wiene soargen.
A good man could have done the same.	In goed man koe itselde dien hawwe.
That's what they did.	Dat diene se.
Neither happened here.	Gjin fan beide barde hjir.
Either you are going to get help or.	Of jo geane help krije of .
But the meeting never happened.	Mar de gearkomste hat nea bard.
Do not worry about it.	Wês der net drok fan.
It was from her mother.	It wie fan har mem.
For me, one thing is for sure.	Foar my is ien ding wis.
He just touched.	Hy rekke gewoan oan.
Not here, not for her.	Net hjir, net foar har.
She must.	Se moat.
But do not take our word for it.	Mar nim ús wurd der net foar.
We're just a way away.	Wy binne gewoan in wei fuort.
They are not real.	Se binne net echt.
That's what I've always said.	Dat haw ik altyd sein.
His mother is coming home soon.	Syn mem komt gau thús.
The man would not agree with her.	De man soe it net iens mei har besykje.
I did nothing wrong.	Ik haw neat ferkeard dien.
I love these people so much.	Ik hâld safolle fan dizze minsken.
My family is fine.	Myn famylje is goed.
Then back in the car.	Dan wer yn 'e auto.
The friends we make.	De freonen dy't wy meitsje.
Or it can be nothing.	Of it kin neat wurde.
We did it.	Wy hawwe it dien.
She had a good life.	Se hie in goed libben.
I'm just surprised.	Ik bin gewoan ferrast.
All of those things are real.	Al dy dingen binne echt.
You said this could not happen.	Jo seine dat dit net barre koe.
She was sure of that.	Dêr wie se wis fan.
I'll be back in two days.	Ik kom oer twa dagen werom.
You may already be working on it.	It kin wêze dat jo dêr al oan wurkje.
That in itself would be difficult.	Dat soe op himsels dreech wêze.
Good for you.	Goed foar dy.
You would have come best with me.	Do hiest it bêste mei my kommen.
But she never said anything to him.	Mar se sei noait wat tsjin him.
Let me just for now.	Lit my mar foar no.
But it was not there.	Mar it wie der net.
Work was either done or not.	Wurk waard of dien of net.
He was late, he knew.	Hy wie let, wist er.
That was the word we got.	Dat wie it wurd dat wy krigen.
You must always be careful when driving.	Jo moatte altyd foarsichtich wêze by it riden.
Everything is gone.	Alles is fuort.
I see that now.	Dat sjoch ik no.
There was something she had not heard.	Der wie wat dat se net heard hie.
I would have loved to have been with my family.	Ik soe graach tegearre west hawwe mei myn famylje.
They always work.	Se wurkje altyd.
Can't do that anymore.	Kin dat net mear dwaan.
When we both try, we have time left over.	As wy beide besykje, hawwe wy tiid oer.
I assume you should not be here.	Ik nim oan dat jo hjir net moatte wêze.
It was your idea.	It wie dyn idee.
Come home and talk to me.	Kom thús en praat mei my.
We will be there.	Wy sille der wêze.
There was absolutely nothing.	Der wie hielendal neat.
To this day, we do.	Oant hjoed de dei dogge wy.
He was just going to do it.	Hy gie it gewoan te dwaan.
Give me back my letter.	Jou my myn brief werom.
It worked too well.	It wurke te goed.
I had to see.	Ik moast sjen.
Or watch it.	Of sjoch it.
True, my husband is good to me.	Wier, myn man is goed foar my.
It was time to see what really happens.	It wie tiid om te sjen wat der echt bart.
It could not either.	It koe ek net.
It strikes me.	It komt my oan.
I'm sorry !.	Dat spyt my!.
There are many things to see.	Der is in protte dingen te sjen.
I've been here.	Ik bin hjir west.
There was no boy.	Der wie gjin jonge.
There may be something we can do.	Der kin wat wêze dat wy dwaan kinne.
He asked me what the plan was.	Hy frege my wat it plan wie.
There's one standing in front of the door.	Der stiet ien foar de doar.
I just felt the hand.	Ik fielde allinnich de hân.
You're very nice.	Do bist hiel aardich.
I do not want.	Ik wol net.
And just in time too.	En krekt op tiid ek.
What could be better.	Wat soe better wêze.
But for us, it's just the man and the children.	Mar foar ús binne it gewoan de man en de bern.
And said so.	En sei sa.
I do now, and it's a big help.	Ik doch no, en it is in grutte help.
But tell your mother.	Mar fertel dyn mem.
That they are no more.	Dat se net mear binne.
A good thing too.	In goed ding ek.
I could not say who it was.	Ik koe net sizze wa't it wie.
He really has a way about it.	Hy hat echt in manier oer him.
He came when we were still doing that.	Hy kaam doe't wy dat noch diene.
Must know.	Moatte witte.
I'm from school.	Ik bin fan skoalle.
It was just this.	It wie gewoan dit.
Really easy to give.	Echt maklik te jaan.
I have a car.	Ik haw in auto.
Up and in my office all morning.	Op en op myn kantoar de hiele moarn.
It was much better this way than the others.	It wie op dizze manier folle better as de oare.
However, it had to be done.	Hoe dan ek, it moast dien wurde.
Let things happen.	Lit dingen barre.
And good too.	En goed ek.
I have nothing to worry about.	Ik haw neat te soargen oer.
Please do not give up.	Jou asjebleaft net op.
We could not return.	Wy koene net werom.
She was not a man but a woman.	Se wie gjin man mar in frou.
I can 't deal with it now.	Ik kin der no net mei.
Didn't expect to see you again.	Hie net ferwachte dy wer te sjen.
I know how he's coming.	Ik wit hoe't er komt.
Not even for one day.	Net iens foar ien dei.
You need to be better.	Jo moatte better wêze.
Then you can do whatever you want with this.	Dan kinne jo dwaan wat jo wolle mei dizze.
Of course, we will never agree.	Wy sille fansels nea iens.
It worried me.	It makke my soargen.
But they had always come.	Mar se wiene altyd kommen.
But we do not really have to tell.	Mar wy hoege it net echt te fertellen.
We eat pretty well now.	Wy ite no aardich goed.
There was no one to be seen.	Der wie net ien te sjen.
And he does it better.	En hy docht it better.
We make good time.	Wy meitsje goede tiid.
The woman had not seen her father for more than a week.	De frou hie har heit al mear as in wike net sjoen.
He wanted to know what happened.	Hy woe witte wat der barde.
Or so he thinks.	Of sa tinkt er.
He hoped it was.	Hy hope dat it wie.
Be this way.	Wês op dizze manier.
I'm just out of everything.	Ik bin gewoan út alles.
Have a good one !.	Hawwe in goede ien!.
Why would he not do it.	Wêrom soe er it net dwaan.
I do not think we will ever.	Ik tink net dat wy oait sille.
It sure works here.	It wurket hjir wis.
Let's have dinner there tonight.	Litte wy dêr fannacht ite.
But she regrets it herself.	Mar it hat har sels te spyt.
See it though.	Sjoch it wol.
This is not.	Dizze is net.
This is obviously not working.	Dit is fansels net wurket.
How long would it take to do it any other way.	Hoefolle tiid soe it nimme om it op in oare manier te dwaan.
It's not difficult.	It is net dreech.
I like to see him like that.	Ik sjoch him graach sa.
It should be no problem.	It soe gjin probleem wêze moatte.
This was one.	Dit wie ien.
Not really mine, but the ones around me.	Net echt myn, mar dy om my hinne.
I don't know why.	Ik wit net wêrom.
That's exactly what we have.	Dat is krekt wat wy hawwe.
Being different is hard.	Oars wêze is dreech.
It was time someone knew it.	It wie tiid dat immen it wist.
I asked if she could do that and she said she did.	Ik frege oft se dy koe en se sei dat se it die.
She did not expect him to agree with her.	Se hie net ferwachte dat er it mei har iens soe.
It may be his.	It kin fan syn wêze.
But we know why.	Mar wy witte wêrom.
My father did not say a word.	Myn heit sei gjin wurd.
He knew why he did it.	Hy wist wêrom hy dit die.
I have no idea what they are, but they talk back.	Ik ha gjin idee wat se binne, mar se praat werom.
But you really have to see it for yourself.	Mar jo moatte it echt sels sjen.
We talk to each other.	Wy prate mei elkoar.
After all, he would be too late.	Nei alle gedachten soe er te let wêze.
It's nice, against friends.	It is moai, tsjin freonen.
It must be really good though.	It moat wol echt goed wêze.
I want to give you the same opportunity.	Ik wol dy deselde kâns jaan.
The word comes out.	It wurd komt út.
This has been the case since they were children.	Sa wie it al sûnt se bern wiene.
Here was a great opportunity.	Hjir wie in grutte kâns.
I think we were in there again.	Ik tink dat wy der wer yn wiene.
I heard about you.	Ik hearde oer dy.
He was her only hope.	Hy wie har ienige hope.
There are some things that money can not buy.	D'r binne wat dingen dy't jild net kin keapje.
We're back in bed.	Wy binne wer op bêd.
You've never seen me before.	Do hast my noch noait sjoen.
You talk to her concerns.	Jo prate mei har soargen.
He probably has no idea who you are.	Hy hat wierskynlik gjin idee wa't jo binne.
He did it well.	Hy hat it goed dien.
It's three hours.	It is trije oeren.
You want to help, but you can not.	Jo wolle helpe, mar jo kinne net.
Nothing much to say.	Neat folle te sizzen.
I'm doing really well.	It giet my echt goed.
She could go away.	Se koe fuort.
They proceed with caution.	Se geane foarsichtich troch.
We're back home.	Wy binne werom nei hûs.
We'll go.	Wy sille gean.
Things do not have to go wrong.	Dingen hoege net ferkeard te gean.
Two people are killed.	Twa minsken komme om it libben.
There was still time for her to go back.	Der wie noch tiid foar har om werom te gean.
Many of us did.	In protte fan ús diene.
He had no idea who she was, who any of her was.	Hy hie gjin idee wa't se wie, wa't ien fan har wie.
And there is much more to come.	En der is noch folle mear te kommen.
Almost no one knew the truth.	Hast gjinien wist de wierheid.
This was a beautiful hour.	Dit wie in moai oere.
You will not have heard this.	Jo sille dit net heard hawwe.
I know she can not.	Ik wit dat se net kin.
We'll go in with you.	Wy geane mei dy yn.
You can help me, if you want.	Jo kinne my helpe, as jo wolle.
Tell me your problem.	Fertel my dyn probleem.
If she hadn’t already.	As se dat net al wie.
You can not just be against something.	Jo kinne net gewoan tsjin wat wêze.
Let me out of there.	Lit my der út.
Carefully they opened the door.	Foarsichtich diene se de doar iepen.
The bed was still in place.	It bêd wie noch op syn plak.
She herself has done nothing wrong.	Se hat sels neat ferkeard dien.
It's not that I do not want, I want.	It is net dat ik net wol, ik wol.
In a way, she had.	Op in manier hie se.
Dad would have made the party.	Heit soe it feest makke hawwe.
I've seen this before.	Ik haw sjoen dit foar.
I did not want to think of her as old.	Ik woe net tinke oan har as âld.
You're so nice.	Do bist sa aardich.
The work is not too bad.	It wurk is net al te min.
I do not think she is one of those two words.	Ik tink net dat se ien fan dy twa wurden is.
This is for a reason.	Dit is foar in reden.
I'll be back very soon.	Ik kom hiel gau werom.
She did not know why she had to say something.	Se wist net wêrom't se wat sizze moast.
I'm not a young woman.	Ik bin gjin jonge frou.
It's so come.	It is sa kommen.
I would like to know.	Ik soe it witte wolle.
See for yourself.	Sjoch foar har sels.
Who saw her.	Wa seach har.
He felt very tired.	Hy fielde him wurch wurch.
But this is the last chance.	Mar dit is de lêste kâns.
Everyone is talking about this.	Elkenien praat oer dit.
I died too.	Ik kaam ek om.
It's very easy.	It is hiel maklik.
Only you are.	Allinnich do bist.
It was too late to come back.	It wie te let om werom te kommen.
I just want to help in some way.	Ik wol gewoan op ien of oare manier helpe.
He looked at the door.	Hy seach nei de doar.
It might have been a good idea to tell someone about it.	It wie miskien wol in goed idee om dêr ien oer te fertellen.
The guy was gone.	De keardel wie fuort.
Everything had to be his way.	Alles moast op syn manier wêze.
The man committed suicide.	De man die himsels om it libben.
I'm going there to make a place for you.	Ik gean der hinne om in plak foar dy klear te meitsjen.
But not so.	Mar net sa.
You do not know everything.	Jo witte net alles.
There were a lot of kids left.	Der wiene in protte bern oer.
Here is a picture of my family.	Hjir is in foto fan myn famylje.
This is for her.	Dit is foar har.
You do that if you have lived by yourself.	Jo dogge dat as jo sels wenne hawwe.
That is not the truth.	Dat is net de wierheid.
This is exactly the same.	Dit is krekt itselde.
I had to eat.	Ik moast ite.
I look forward to it, she thought.	Ik sjoch der út, tocht se.
Do believe me.	Do leau my.
I'm glad you came.	Ik bin bliid dat jo kommen binne.
He did not look at me.	Hy seach my net oan.
We could not get to him.	Wy koene net by him komme.
Maybe I just do not know how it works.	Miskien wit ik gewoan net hoe't it wurket.
He felt it too.	Hy fielde it ek.
It would never be the same.	It soe nea wêze itselde.
It has been.	It hat west.
Do you have any idea where he could be found?	Hawwe jo in idee wêr't hy koe wurde fûn?
But that happens.	Mar dat bart.
Well, two things.	No, twa dingen.
This will not work.	Dit sil net wurkje.
We are just.	Wy binne gewoan.
We're still working.	Wy wurkje noch.
And that's not it.	En dat is it net.
He was with a woman.	Hy wie mei in frou.
I think you should come with me.	Ik tink dat jo mei my komme moatte.
And he was wrong.	En hy wie ferkeard.
Everyone was sick of it.	Elkenien wie der siik fan.
What do you want to eat today?	Wat wolle jo hjoed ite?
There were so many.	Der wiene safolle.
She could not believe it.	Se koe it net leauwe.
I do not think anyone can !.	Ik tink net dat immen kin!.
I take the other.	Ik nim de oare.
That's not good.	Dat is net goed.
They can try.	Se kinne besykje.
Was that something.	Wie dat wat.
I did the same and worked well.	Ik die itselde en wurke goed.
But it was not so good at home.	Mar it wie thús net sa goed.
He does nothing.	Hy docht neat.
I'm pretty tired.	Ik bin aardich wurch.
He wanted to do everything.	Hy woe alles dwaan.
Not sure what the problem is.	Net wis wat is it probleem.
He always goes out for dinner.	Hy giet altyd út foar it iten.
But they did not read it well.	Mar se hawwe it net goed lêzen.
All he can do is wait and worry.	Alles wat hy kin dwaan is wachtsje en soargen.
She did not want to go against him.	Se woe net tsjin him.
I thought they got them.	Ik tocht dat se har krigen.
I'm not the one they want.	Ik bin net dejinge dy't se wolle.
That's all you are here to do.	Dat binne jo hjir allegear om te dwaan.
But it's more than that.	Mar it is mear as dat.
I still have them just like before.	Ik haw se noch krekt as earder.
I was just happy.	Ik wie gewoan bliid.
I never wanted this to happen.	Ik woe nea dit barre.
So here too.	Sa ek hjir.
It was hard.	It wie dreech.
I think they should all win.	Ik tink dat se allegear winne moatte.
I will never get anything done.	Ik sil noait wat dien krije.
You must go, my friend.	Jo moatte gean, myn freon.
I did not know why it happened.	Ik wist net wêrom't it barde.
It would not last long.	It soe net lang bliuwe.
Everyone loves me.	Elkenien hâldt fan my.
It could be this way or that way.	It kin dizze manier of dy manier wêze.
You do not have to do this, she said.	Jo hoege dit net te dwaan, sei se.
So let's keep that in mind.	Dat litte wy dat yn gedachten hâlde.
Time goes by and tomorrow there is another day.	De tiid giet troch en moarn is der wer in dei.
I knew she would be happy.	Ik wist dat se bliid wêze soe.
I was happy with him.	Ik wie bliid mei him.
Think before you speak.	Tink foardat jo prate.
Does reading make you happy?	Makket it lêzen jo bliid?
That's so much.	Dat is sa heul.
We are here for you.	Wy binne hjir foar dy.
Take time, but not too much time.	Nim tiid, mar net te folle tiid.
They go on.	Se geane troch.
I came up with nothing.	Ik kaam mei neat.
This was wrong.	Dit wie ferkeard.
Didn't have to look up.	Hoegde net op te sjen.
Or a bed.	Of in bêd.
We really can not.	Wy kinne echt net.
We do not know why that man did that.	Wy witte net wêrom dy man dat die.
Exactly the same.	Itselde krekt.
They hit it again, again, again.	Se rekke it wer, wer, wer.
Who did this to me.	Wa't my dit dien hat.
They were here for hours.	Se wiene hjir oeren.
To say nothing.	Om neat te sizzen.
We live here now and we need help.	Wy wenje hjir no en wy hawwe help nedich.
Time to go.	Tiid om te gean.
This is obviously better than the last place.	Dit is fansels better as it lêste plak.
That's for sure.	Dat is wis.
It just would not happen.	It soe gewoan net barre.
It was the best thing ever.	It wie it bêste ding ea.
I met friends and made new ones.	Ik moete mei freonen en makke nije.
I never found them.	Ik haw se noait fûn.
Well, so far we're fine.	Goed, oant no ta binne wy ​​goed.
So, we did the best we could.	Dat, wy diene it bêste dat wy koene.
I thought of you.	Ik haw oan dy tocht.
This is the size.	Dit is de grutte.
No problem, we say.	Gjin probleem, sizze wy.
It should not happen.	It moat net barre.
I will work and you will go to school.	Ik sil wurkje en jo geane nei skoalle.
You can stay here or go home or whatever.	Jo kinne hjir bliuwe of nei hûs gean of wat dan ek.
She probably was.	Se wie wierskynlik.
Pay them off.	Betelje se ôf.
He does not know what to say.	Hy wit net wat te sizzen.
No one knew where he lived.	Nimmen wist wêr't hy wenne.
I do not know, maybe something to do with children.	Ik wit it net, miskien wat mei bern te dwaan.
He would have nothing to do with it.	Hy soe der neat fan ha.
I did not have to say it twice.	Ik hoegde it net twa kear te sizzen.
You can see it, right?	Jo kinne it sjen, krekt?
This is just one city.	Dit is mar ien stêd.
It wanted more, and there was more to come.	It woe mear, en der kaam mear.
We probably will.	Wy sille wierskynlik.
You know, it was something both.	Jo witte, it wie wat beide.
And what is it? 	En wat is dit?
he asked.	hy frege.
I said it before.	Ik sei it earder.
People play them, but not enough.	Minsken spylje se, mar net genôch.
They need to be more.	Se moatte mear wêze.
With how busy you have been lately, you worry.	Mei hoe drok jo it de lêste tiid hawwe, meitsje jo jo soargen.
I do not feel that today.	Dat fiel ik hjoed net.
I remember his mother.	Ik tink oan syn mem.
Syn or her.	Syn of har.
I do not even know how.	Ik wit net iens hoe.
It's my father.	It is myn heit.
I know he knows about us.	Ik wit dat hy oer ús wit.
For me, it's a bit of both.	Foar my is it in bytsje fan beide.
I hope you like them.	Ik hoopje dat jo se leuk fine.
This would never do.	Dit soe nea dwaan.
There was just so much he did not know about him.	Der wie krekt safolle dat er net fan him wist.
Maybe with time it goes away.	Miskien mei de tiid giet it fuort.
I really should work to make that happen.	Ik soe echt moatte wurkje om dat barre te meitsjen.
That no one would ever love me.	Dat nimmen soe oait fan my hâlde.
The man walked with the dog.	De man rûn mei de hûn.
And we could do so many things for the people.	En wy koene safolle dingen dwaan foar de minsken.
That was the whole problem.	Dat wie it hiele probleem.
I'm still thinking about it.	Ik tink der noch oer nei.
She knew what she wanted out of life.	Se wist wat se út it libben woe.
It's nice to get out of there.	It is moai om der fan ôf te kommen.
I could talk to her for you.	Ik koe mei har prate foar jo.
Do not enter the house.	Gean net yn 'e hûs.
Not so with people. 	Net sa mei minsken. 
Before she died.	Foardat se stoar.
But we know they do not have it.	Mar wy witte dat se it net hawwe.
It really does.	It echt docht.
Not anything else.	Net wat oars.
More than bad.	Mear as min.
He the I only.	Hy die ek net.
Make that what you want.	Meitsje fan dat wat jo wolle.
I do not want to go home.	Ik wol net nei hûs.
You're wrong about that.	Dêr binne jo ferkeard oer.
They are not just words.	It binne net allinnich wurden.
I did not expect him.	Ik hie him net ferwachte.
He does not either.	Hy docht ek net.
By a woman.	Troch in frou.
It used to be a problem.	It wie eartiids in probleem.
He's where he's doing something good.	Hy is wêr't hy wat goed docht.
It's nothing.	It is neat.
They would have been on time.	Se soene op 'e tiid west hawwe.
What water there was had a name.	Wat wetter der wie hie in namme.
But they will come in handy.	Mar se sille goed komme.
I was at work.	Ik wie oan it wurk.
I wanted to do it.	Ik woe der oan dwaan.
The boy seemed to like himself.	De jonge like wol himsels.
Everything is fine so far.	Alles is goed oant no ta.
You did the right thing.	Do hast it goede dien.
Maybe he already has one.	Miskien hat er al ien.
Will leave it.	Sil dit litte.
It was pretty nice and obviously old.	It wie moai moai en fansels âld.
They are very nice.	Se binne hiel aardich.
That was only a few days ago.	Dat wie mar in pear dagen lyn.
It's the same question.	It is deselde fraach.
It was obviously not easy.	It wie fansels net maklik.
So he got me.	Sa krige er my.
She first went to the young man.	Se gie earst nei de jonge man.
She does not have much money.	Se hat net folle jild.
But that's new week.	Mar dat is nije wike.
He said it was a really good idea.	Hy sei dat it in echt goed idee wie.
We just have to see.	Wy moatte mar sjen.
We do not agree with that.	Dêr binne wy ​​net mei iens.
He would never love you.	Hy soe noait fan dy hâlde.
By day he can not eat.	By dei kin er net ite.
Take me home, please.	Nim my thús, asjebleaft.
But he also looked good.	Mar hy seach der ek goed út.
he asked.	hy frege.
I'm not sure that will happen.	Ik bin der net wis fan dat it sil barre.
My father used to come here.	Myn heit kaam hjir eartiids mei.
It's really not careful.	It is echt net foarsichtich.
Tell me where he is.	Fertel my wêr't hy is.
She looked like her mother.	Se like op har mem.
She was a different person.	Se wie in oare persoan.
You will have to do everything.	Jo sille alles dwaan moatte.
Not without a plan.	Net sûnder in plan.
He wants me to tell him.	Hy wol dat ik it him fertel.
For no reason at all.	Foar hielendal gjin reden.
They love everyone.	Se hâlde fan elkenien.
Never seen her.	Nea sjoen har.
There you go.	Dêr komme jo yn.
If anyone wants to try it, please let me know.	As immen it besykje wol, lit it my dan graach witte.
I'm going away.	Ik sil fuort.
Everyone in the family was busy.	Elkenien yn 'e famylje wie drok.
I have never seen such a thing in my entire life.	Ik haw yn myn hiele libben noch noait sa'n ding sjoen.
Were no friends.	Wiene gjin freonen.
She wanted it so badly that she actually tried it.	Se woe it sa graach dat se eins besocht.
He would go home.	Hy soe nei hûs ta gean.
I'm not me, she thought.	Ik bin net ik, tocht se.
They've actually done that before.	Dat hawwe se eins earder dien.
If you say the same things, you agree.	As jo ​​​​deselde dingen prate, binne jo it iens.
I always did not like him.	Ik haw altyd net leuk him.
It goes like this.	It giet sa.
Everyone needs money these days.	Elkenien hat dizze dagen jild nedich.
This can be a bad thing.	Dit kin in minne ding wêze.
Then to another, but this time in a car.	Dan nei in oare, mar dizze kear yn in auto.
This is what will happen.	Dit is wat der barre sil.
Let's talk soon.	Lit ús gau prate.
Maybe that's the reason.	Miskien is dat de reden.
Nothing seemed to have happened.	Der like neat bard te wêzen.
There she had to go.	Dêr moast se hinne.
I worked here though.	Ik wurke hjir wol.
I tried to do everything myself.	Ik besocht alles sels te dwaan.
But we can do something about it.	Mar wy kinne der wat oan dwaan.
Maybe there was nothing to find.	Miskien wie der neat te finen.
Just be.	Gewoan wêze .
Man, that was nice.	Man, it wie moai.
Day in and day out.	Dei yn dei út.
He had nothing more to say.	Hy hie neat mear te sizzen.
Please help me to do it.	Help my asjebleaft om it te dwaan.
I know everything you have to say.	Ik wit alles wat jo te sizzen hawwe.
It didn't matter.	Der makke neat út.
She knew exactly what he could do to her father.	Se wist krekt wat er oan har heit dwaan koe.
Think about what he knows.	Tink oer wat hy wit.
I was beautiful.	Ik wie moai.
I used to eat there.	Ik iet dêr eartiids.
Is that from you or from your mother?	Is dat fan jo of fan jo mem?
He looked tired.	Hy seach wurch.
But this time it would be different.	Mar dizze kear soe it oars wêze.
For my husband, his life was his job and ours.	Foar myn man wie syn libben syn wurk en ús.
That was it.	Dat wie it.
She was alone in the office when it happened.	Se wie allinnich op it kantoar doe't it barde.
You've never talked to any of us.	Jo hawwe noait mei ien fan ús praat.
A door was open.	In doar wie iepen.
It felt good.	It fielde goed.
That was just as good.	Dat wie like goed.
He will have a little chance.	Hy sil in bytsje kâns hawwe.
It's clear she has that.	It is dúdlik dat se dat hat.
That's it for us.	Dat is it foar ús.
Think that can be good too.	Tink dat dat ek goed kin.
But not now, not in the next year.	Mar net no, net yn it folgjende jier.
I said sure, when.	Ik sei wis, wannear.
I never knew my father.	Ik koe myn heit noait.
I no longer need friends.	Ik haw gjin freonen mear nedich.
But no one knows what would happen.	Mar gjinien wit wat der barre soe.
Why did they do this?	Wêrom hawwe se dit dien?
See what happened to my family.	Sjoch wat der bard is mei myn famylje.
He really thought it was going pretty well with her.	Hy hie echt tocht dat it mei har aardich goed gien wie.
If it's different, and he didn 't think about it, it's wrong.	As it oars is, en hy hat der net oan tocht, is it ferkeard.
I could not wait to see them.	Ik koe net wachtsje om se te sjen.
You do not have to tell it until you want to tell it.	Jo hoege it net te fertellen oant jo it fertelle wolle.
It can happen to anyone.	It kin elkenien barre.
I can not go through this again.	Ik kin dit net wer troch.
It was all but a sure thing.	It wie alles mar in wis ding.
Where did that come from?	Wêr kaam dat wei?
But even that was good.	Mar ek dat wie goed.
So it was last night.	Sa wie it fannacht.
You need to have money to spend money.	Jo moatte jild hawwe om jild út te jaan.
You have to be careful.	Jo moatte foarsichtich wêze.
He had to help.	Hy moast helpe.
But come on.	Mar kom mar.
He's talked about it before.	Hy hat it der al earder oer hân.
That could easily happen again.	Dat koe maklik wer.
There are so many problems.	Der binne safolle problemen.
And what is better than nothing.	En wat is better as neat.
Never will be again.	Nea sil wêze wer.
Let me put it another way.	Lit my it oars sizze.
He had never seen her before and he never saw her again.	Hy hie har nea earder sjoen en hy seach har noait wer.
He did not know.	Hy wist it net.
We are not interested in that.	Dêr binne wy ​​net yn ynteressearre.
It's just beautiful.	It is gewoan moai.
That's a very bad idea.	Dat is hiel min idee.
I told him not to worry about it.	Ik sei tsjin him om der gjin soargen oer te meitsjen.
Mom is with him.	Mem is by him.
But there is nothing.	Mar der is neat.
He was tall, a nice man.	Hy wie lang, in aardich man.
Do nothing else.	Doch neat oars.
This year never came.	Dit jier kaam noait.
The truth is that no one knows.	De wierheid is dat gjinien wit.
I wanted to know everything about her.	Ik woe alles oer har witte.
And if you want, your dad can stay here.	En as jo wolle, kin jo heit hjir bliuwe.
In more that was one.	Yn mear wie dat ien.
I thought he could play.	Ik tocht dat hy koe spylje.
He actually looks pretty good.	Hy sjocht der eins aardich goed út.
You're a good friend.	Do bist in goede freon.
She walked to the door, and left the door open.	Se rûn nei de doar, en liet de doar iepen.
But never sure.	Mar nea wis.
He knows you're here.	Hy wit dat jo hjir binne.
They did that first.	Dat diene se earst.
But they would not do that either.	Mar dat soene se ek net dwaan.
This door opened.	Dizze doar gie iepen.
I see what can not be.	Ik sjoch wat der net wêze kin.
You want to know.	Jo witte wol.
That made everyone around us, including us, very angry.	Dat makke elkenien om ús hinne, ek ús, tige lilk.
Nothing about that.	Dêr neat oer.
It looks like he needs one.	It liket derop dat er ien nedich hat.
She looked as scared as ever.	Se seach like bang as altyd.
I can not stay away from her.	Ik kin net fan har ôf bliuwe.
This way.	Dizze manier.
The man who knows you.	De man dy't dy ken.
I will never, ever be without your book.	Ik sil noait, ea sûnder jo boek wêze.
Now everything is working fine.	No wurket alles goed.
Soon a full moon came up.	Al gau kaam der in folle moanne op.
And that's good.	En dat is goed.
We had no food or water at all.	Wy hiene hielendal gjin iten of wetter.
Maybe she's scared to see what's in it.	Miskien is se bang om te sjen wat der yn sit.
This book is hard to read.	Dit boek is dreech om te lêzen.
But good with me.	Mar goed mei my.
That's one way to do it, if it was thought necessary.	Dat is ien manier om it te dwaan, as it nedich tocht waard.
Nobody knows what people will get out of it.	Nimmen wit wol wat minsken der út komme.
But that's not why people buy them.	Mar dat is net wêrom't minsken se keapje.
Otherwise it would be fine.	Oars soe it wol goed komme.
He did it really well too.	Hy die it ek echt goed.
He was sitting in there now.	Hy siet der no yn.
You have to be careful.	Jo moatte foarsichtich wêze.
I'm not like my husband.	Ik bin net as myn man.
He just wasn’t.	Hy wie gewoan net.
He was different.	Hy wie oars.
Take that woman over there.	Nim dy frou dêr hinne.
We were very happy there and we love our friends.	Wy wiene dêr tige bliid en wy hâlde fan ús freonen.
No one could hurt me.	Nimmen koe my sear dwaan.
Be on your way.	Wês op jo wei.
It came last night.	It kaam fannacht.
Sick and wrong.	Siik en ferkeard.
There is hope for all.	Der is hope foar allegear.
It was getting late.	It waard let.
It had to have.	It moast hawwe.
Everyone will wait.	Elkenien sil wachtsje.
It was a whole day of giving.	It wie in hiele dei fan jaan.
It's too fun to watch.	It is te leuk om te sjen.
Let them know it happened.	Lit se witte dat it bard is.
I'm not talking to anyone.	Ik praat mei gjinien.
Too long.	Te lang.
I have not seen him for a long time.	Ik haw him lang net sjoen.
We will not be here forever.	Wy sille hjir net foar altyd wêze.
But he could not regret it.	Mar hy koe der gjin spyt fan hawwe.
Might be wrong, of course.	Kin ferkeard wêze, fansels.
We just worked.	Wy wurke gewoan.
Here's how it goes.	Hjir is hoe't it giet.
That this is clearly not enough.	Dat dit is dúdlik net genôch.
Whatever that is.	Wat dat ek is.
Why would he.	Wêrom soe hy.
We need to do something good.	Wy moatte wat goed dwaan.
You are not mine.	Jo binne net fan my.
And bad for everyone.	En min foar elkenien.
But it is what it is.	Mar it is wat is.
Just let her go.	Lit har mar ôf.
But it's not what you think it is.	Mar it is net wat jo tinke dat it is.
Everything is the same, but looks different.	Alles is itselde, mar sjocht der oars út.
The teacher found it difficult to go.	De learaar fûn it dreech om te gean.
If you win, you win.	As jo ​​winne, winne jo.
There is so much to talk about.	Der is safolle om oer te praten.
My parents do.	Myn âlden dogge.
If you ever need me, for everything.	As jo ​​my oait nedich hawwe, foar alles.
They are not everything.	Se binne net alles.
For the last time.	Foar de lêste kear.
I also look forward to those days.	Ik sjoch ek út nei dy dagen.
She felt free.	Se fielde har frij.
I'm leaving too.	Ik gean ek fuort.
We do not find it so.	Wy fine it net sa.
Keep it up, but clear.	Hâld dy op, mar dúdlik.
In fact, she no longer looked like a woman.	Eins like se net mear op in frou.
He took his seat in the bus.	Hy naam syn sit yn 'e bus.
I could wait until tomorrow.	Ik koe oant moarn wachtsje.
And now no one wants to see.	En no wol nimmen sjen.
It has been.	It hat west.
I was never one of those people.	Ik wie nea ien fan dy minsken.
It was another time.	It wie in oare tiid.
That's what came into you.	Dat is wat yn dy kaam.
The whole plan had been hers.	It hiele plan hie har west.
Or a lot.	Of in protte.
He had not even thought about it.	Hy hie der net iens oan tocht.
I was actually planning to do the same thing.	Ik wie eins fan plan itselde ding te dwaan.
But with it, my, my.	Mar mei it, myn, myn.
Not for everyone.	Net foar elkenien.
We had some work to do with this man.	Wy hiene wat wurk te dwaan mei dizze man.
To continue.	Om troch te gean.
You never know with me.	Jo witte noait mei my.
At class.	By de klasse.
His mother was ready.	Syn mem wie klear.
I will never want that, you will see for yourself.	Ik sil noait wolle, dat sille jo sels sjen.
We can not see.	Wy kinne net sjen.
Could not get enough.	Koe net genôch krije.
On and on and on.	Oan en oan en oan.
Just go here.	Gean hjir mar hinne.
It does not need much water.	It hat net folle wetter nedich.
he asked.	hy frege.
They hope that would not be a problem.	Se hope dat dat gjin probleem wurde soe.
That's not how it works, he thought.	Sa komt it net, tocht er.
But one thing.	Mar ien ding.
That was not up to us.	Dat wie net oan ús.
This was hard to say.	Dit wie dreech te sizzen.
I'll make it happen.	Ik sil it barre.
Nor would we.	Dat soene wy ​​ek net.
On an evening, think.	Op in jûn, tink.
He is clearly happy.	Hy is dúdlik bliid.
She will be happy.	Se sil bliid wêze.
He is like what came before him.	Hy is as wat foar him kaam.
But there is something that is not quite right.	Mar d'r is wat dat net hielendal goed is.
But if that was the case, she did not let it go.	Mar as dat sa wie, liet se it net litte.
I can not tell these things to people. 	Ik kin dizze dingen net oan minsken fertelle. 
He could not see.	Hy koe net sjen.
But it is not, of course.	Mar it is net, fansels.
People don’t like that.	Minsken net dat soarte.
I have nothing to do with you.	Ik ha neat oan dy.
Everyone here knows the office.	Elkenien hjir kin it kantoar.
He was very surprised.	Hy wie tige ferrast.
We parents had nothing to do with it.	Wy âlden hiene der neat oan.
They happen, but not often.	Se barre, mar net faak.
I do not know how it came with him.	Ik wit net hoe't it mei him kaam.
This was the expected way to get around.	Dit wie de ferwachte manier om om te kommen.
She had no idea where he wanted to go.	Se hie gjin idee wêr't er hinne woe.
It must be good then.	It moat dan goed wêze.
He can't quite get over that.	Dat kin er net hielendal oer.
That's what he said.	Dat sei er eins.
What do we eat for dinner tonight?	Wat ite wy fannacht foar it iten?
It must be so.	It moat sa wêze.
It seemed like she did not.	It like miskien dat se it net die.
Show them how it's done.	Lit har sjen hoe't it dien is.
I have never seen such a thing.	Ik haw noch noait sa'n ding sjoen.
People see something and know best.	Minsken wat te sjen en witte it bêste.
You can try this for yourself.	Jo kinne dit sels besykje.
And that might just work.	En dat kin gewoan wurkje.
The picture here is that nothing really happened this week.	De foto hjir is dat dizze wike echt neat bard is.
I look back.	Ik sjoch werom.
From what you know.	Fan 'e jo witte.
Let's not talk about that now.	Lit ús dêr no net oer prate.
I think you're really a woman.	Ik tink do bist echt frou.
It could have been so easy for me.	It koe sa maklik my wêze.
I was up.	Ik wie op.
He was so good to me.	Hy wie sa goed foar my.
I hope you are doing well in your new job.	Ik hoopje dat jo goed gean yn jo nije baan.
It is not the first time and it will not be the last.	It is net de earste kear en it sil net de lêste wêze.
I love her in everything.	Ik hâld fan har yn alles.
He needs to get to bed.	Hy moat op bêd.
If there was anything, it was more so.	As der wat wie, wie it mear sa.
It was really three years ago.	It wie echt trije jier lyn.
John loves his new job.	John hâlde fan syn nije baan.
It would make it very difficult.	It soe meitsje it hiel dreech.
I wish everyone here had some of that.	Ik winskje dat elkenien hjir wat fan hie.
About both of us, actually.	Oer ús beide, eins.
He had kept her there with him.	Hy hie har dêr by him hâlden.
She was very ill.	Se wie tige siik.
He's not really into it.	Hy is der net echt yn.
I'm not one of you.	Ik bin net fan dy.
Let me tell you a few things.	Lit my jo in pear dingen fertelle.
Please, you have to believe me now.	Asjebleaft, jo moatte my no leauwe.
It may not have been good.	It kin net goed west hawwe.
I did not want to see.	Ik woe net sjen.
No one has to go.	Nimmen moat gean.
I'll see.	Ik sil sjen.
And that you have to keep in mind.	En dat moatte jo yn gedachten hâlde.
Everyone was tired.	Elkenien wie wurch.
Or nothing else.	Of oars neat.
But he was, and he will be.	Mar hy wie, en hy sil wêze.
Today was one of those days.	Hjoed wie ien fan dy dagen.
No one is the new someone.	Nimmen is de nije immen.
And then home,.	En dan thús,.
This should tell us something.	Dit moat ús wat fertelle.
See why you are not leaving now.	Sjoch, wêrom geane jo no net fuort.
That they go.	Dat se geane.
Do not know what to say.	Net witte wat te sizzen.
And my father was one.	En myn heit wie ien.
How bad.	Wat min.
They are in place.	Se binne op it plak.
I have no idea what to say.	Ik haw gjin idee wat te sizzen.
We talk, but nothing happens.	Wy prate, mar der bart neat.
All it takes is that you have it.	Alles wat der ta docht is dat jo it hawwe.
I will give him so much.	Ik sil him safolle jaan.
Well then, stop.	No dan, hâld op.
I will take care of you when you get sick.	Ik sil foar jo soargje as jo siik wurde.
She can not believe it.	Se kin it net leauwe.
And she still wished she could see him.	En se woe noch altyd dat se him sjen koe.
I do it often.	Ik doch it faak.
So we can do better.	Sa kinne wy ​​better.
And there is still plenty of time for more.	En der is noch genôch tiid foar mear.
That should not happen.	Dat moat net barre.
We pay for it.	Wy betelje der foar.
Just enough to keep me well, she said.	Krekt genôch om my goed te hâlden, sei se.
We have three children.	Wy hawwe trije bern.
I think it could be both.	Ik tink dat it beide kin wêze.
He liked me too.	Hy mocht my ek graach.
I always like to do this.	Ik liket dit altyd te dwaan.
He was here last year.	Hy wie hjir ferline jier.
That was a problem before this happened.	Dat wie in probleem foardat dit barde.
Once again, we disagree.	Noch ien kear binne wy ​​it net iens.
It would not have worked for my kids or me.	It soe net wurke hawwe foar myn bern of my.
Remove it.	Meitsje it fuort.
I've seen it and it still looks good to me.	Ik haw it sjoen en it liket my noch goed.
And that was good for him.	En dat wie it goede foar him.
He's so much better.	Hy is safolle better.
We're ready.	Wy binne klear.
What a great idea.	Wat in goed idee.
I want to make that money.	Ik wol dat jild meitsje.
She could not stop now.	Se koe no net ophâlde.
There's nothing he will not do.	D'r is neat dat hy net sil dwaan.
It's too hard.	It is te hurd.
I never knew you could do this.	Ik wist noait dat jo dit kinne dwaan.
They really go for it.	Se geane der echt foar.
She could not have returned and not been in.	Se mocht net werom en net yn west hawwe.
It's just that she likes to have a lot of money.	It is gewoan dat se graach in protte jild hat.
I received your letter.	Ik krige dyn brief.
We're talking about that.	Dêr prate wy oer.
Here she comes.	Hjir komt se.
He would not be that person.	Hy soe dy persoan net wêze.
Take it then.	Nim it dan.
But this is not how it should be.	Mar dit is net hoe it moat.
I know what you want to ask.	Ik wit wat jo freegje wolle.
We have not seen more yet.	Mear ha wy noch net sjoen.
My family knows that.	Myn famylje wit dat.
He was just doing his thing there.	Hy wie dêr krekt syn ding te dwaan.
For one reason.	Foar ien reden.
The young woman was angry.	De jonge frou wie lilk.
And that was the last one.	En dat wie de lêste.
Gau.	Gau.
They go out and everyone goes along.	Se geane út en elkenien giet mei.
Your mother is as beautiful as ever.	Jo mem is sa moai as altyd.
He made two new friends today.	Twa nije freonen hat hy hjoed makke.
I'll just say this.	Ik sil dit mar sizze.
It's getting late here.	It wurdt hjir let.
It just kept going.	It bleau gewoan troch.
The work is almost finished.	It wurk is hast klear.
I would not worry about it.	Ik soe der gjin soargen oer meitsje.
He was not himself.	Hy wie net himsels.
A man who is different.	In man dy't oars is.
We are very sorry.	It spyt ús tige.
But he had nothing to do with it.	Mar hy hie der neat oan.
We can not do that yet.	Dat kinne wy ​​noch net.
Here are two.	Hjir binne twa.
He occasionally received a letter from home.	Hy krige sa no en dan in brief fan hûs.
You also need to stay away from these.	Jo moatte ek fan dizze ôf bliuwe.
He had done it again.	Hy hie it wer dien.
He took her home.	Hy naam har mei nei hûs.
I knew it by myself.	Ik wist it fan himsels.
Anyone could see that.	Elkenien koe dat sjen.
But this time it was different.	Mar dizze kear wie it oars.
Well, go in here.	No, gean hjir yn.
Just tell me what you want.	Fertel my mar hokker jo wolle.
Let me see that.	Lit my dat sjen.
It was just fun.	It wie gewoan leuk.
I did not walk away.	Ik rûn net fuort.
It's a good one.	It is in goede ien.
Is something happening?	Is der wat bart?
One person is fine, one person is not.	Ien persoan is goed ôf, ien persoan net.
They say what we say now.	Se sizze wat wy no sizze.
Nothing and no one.	Neat en nimmen.
He looked at her.	Hy seach nei har ta.
You have to make it work.	Jo moatte it wurk meitsje.
I do not know if any of us are ready for that.	Ik wit net oft ien fan ús dêr klear foar is.
Worry, let it have.	Meitsje jo soargen, lit ha it hawwe.
It is clear that he has done this before.	It is dúdlik dat hy dit earder dien hat.
She needs to be careful.	Se moat foarsichtich wêze.
Ask for anything you want.	Freegje om alles wat jo wolle.
There is not much that can be done about this problem.	Der is net folle dat kin dien wurde oan dit probleem.
He turned himself around.	Hy die himsels om.
Then back to the room and plan our day.	Dan werom nei de keamer en plan ús dei.
What time is it now?	Wat is de tiid no?
It does nothing now.	It docht no neat.
And we want to talk to you.	En wy wolle mei dy prate.
About how they keep their home.	Oer hoe't se har thús hâlde.
There she was.	Dêr wie se.
I can get there easily enough.	Ik kin der maklik genôch komme.
This is also true here.	Dit is hjir ek wier.
And you will be there.	En jo sille der wêze.
There were only a few words left.	Der wiene mar in pear wurden oer.
It was soon decided.	It waard gau besletten.
Maybe we never will.	Miskien sille wy noait.
They talk freely about the child.	Se prate frij oer it bern.
Well, here goes to bed.	No, hjir giet op bêd.
It's hard.	It is dreech.
Many of these things go hand in hand.	In protte fan dy dingen geane hân yn hân.
Try very hard.	Besykje hiel hurd.
This photo is at a friend's house.	Dizze foto is by in freon syn hûs.
What he was trying to do.	Wat hy besocht te dwaan.
He opened the door.	Hy die de doar iepen.
And here we find one of the problems.	En hjir fine wy ​​ien fan 'e problemen.
Now the money's up.	No is it jild op.
My only chance.	Myn iennichste kâns.
They really work.	Se wurkje echt.
This is what it's like to be a father.	Dit is wat it is om heit te wêzen.
No problem at all.	Gjin probleem hielendal.
Well, question three.	No, fraach trije.
He is so happy.	Hy is sa bliid.
You will find that we can get one.	Jo sille fine dat wy ien kinne krije.
Everyone can see everyone differently.	Elkenien kin elkenien oars sjen.
I go up to my room.	Ik gean op nei myn keamer.
What a pleasure to see you again!	Wat leuk dy wer te sjen!
I asked her.	frege ik har.
I can not believe this either!	Ik kin dit ek net leauwe!
I would need such help.	Ik soe sa help nedich hawwe.
I know such a man.	Ik ken sa'n man.
I had never done such a thing before.	Ik hie noch noait sa'n ding dien.
I did not like how he looked at me.	Ik mocht net graach hoe't er nei my seach.
It all had to come out.	It moast allegear út.
I have a problem.	Ik haw in probleem.
But that was different.	Mar dat wie oars.
I want another one.	Ik wol noch ien.
I did that.	Dat haw ik dien.
You know me best.	Jo kinne it bêste my.
I hope you know what this is.	Ik hoopje dat jo witte wat dit is.
He could talk himself into or out of everything.	Hy koe him yn of út alles prate.
No money there.	Gjin jild dêr.
I do not want.	Ik wol net.
Everything they do is for people to see them.	Alles wat se dogge is foar minsken om se te sjen.
The trip made for tiring work.	De tocht makke foar wurch wurk.
Angry at her parents.	Lilk op har âlden.
Not one speaks for himself.	Net ien praat sels.
Be better than this.	Wês better dan dit.
And why should you !.	En wêrom moatte jo!.
There's nothing you can do about it.	D'r is neat dat jo dwaan kinne.
The children were scared.	De bern wiene bang.
You will also need to look after them.	Jo sille ek nei har moatte sjen.
That's everyone.	Dat is elkenien.
I know everything, mind you.	Ik wit alles, tink.
Everyone came through.	Elkenien kaam troch.
It's not just about me.	It giet net allinnich om my.
You are in the clear.	Jo binne yn it dúdlik.
That's what you need to do.	Dat moatte jo dwaan.
With the girl.	Mei it famke.
That may not work.	Dat kin net wurkje.
She's not coming home.	Se komt net thús.
Come on, people.	Kom op, minsken.
That's the reason why they stopped.	Dat is de reden wêrom't se ophâlde.
You get the idea.	Jo krije it idee.
To this day, she has never said anything about it.	Oant hjoed de dei hat se der noch noait wat oer sein.
Food could wait.	Iten koe wachtsje.
And that's fun.	En dat is leuk.
That happened often.	Dat barde faak.
To see this simply.	Om dit gewoan te sjen.
But it's not the whole truth.	Mar it is net de hiele wierheid.
She told everything, just everything.	Se fertelde alles, krekt alles.
I found another way.	Ik fûn in oare manier.
And so he took a chance.	En sa naam hy in kâns.
It was totally fun.	It wie hielendal leuk.
It was time to move on to the next thing.	It wie tiid om troch te gean nei it folgjende ding.
We did not know.	Wy wisten it net.
It seemed like my wife.	It like myn frou.
But it really does.	Mar it docht echt.
Maybe that will never happen.	Miskien sil dat noait barre.
He stayed in the office for a few hours.	Hy bleau in pear oeren op kantoar.
He's not a bad boy.	Hy is gjin minne jonge.
For me, it was not good.	Foar my wie it net goed.

He will get a chance to do good work.	Hy sil in kâns krije om goed wurk te dwaan.
But it was too bad of me.	Mar it wie te min fan my.
So you get in the way.	Sa komme jo de wei yn.
He was there.	Hy wie der.
Anyone who had anything to do with this must leave.	Elkenien dy't hjir wat mei te krijen hie, moat fuort.
He does not have much money.	Hy hat net folle jild.
He is a teacher.	Hy is in learaar.
Let it hurt.	Lit it sear dwaan.
This man has no money.	Dizze man hat gjin jild.
But, does he have it? '	Mar, hy hat it wol?'.
See what we do.	Sjoch wat wy dogge.
This girl is now starting to get sick.	Dit famke begûn no siik te wurden.
My father took me there.	Myn heit naam my dêr mei.
Let's see what happens.	Litte wy sjen wat der bart.
They must be one thing, or the other.	Se moatte ien ding wêze, of it oare.
But not too hard.	Mar net te hurd.
It's reading your best friend.	It is it lêzen fan jo bêste freon.
We are all one.	Wy binne allegear ien.
It's what it is.	It is wat it is.
She had done something she knew she could not do.	Se hie wat dien dat se wist dat se net dwaan koe.
You just do not get it.	Jo krije it gewoan net.
No work, no money.	Gjin wurk, gjin jild.
But it was still so much fun.	Mar it wie noch sa sa leuk.
Do it for your words or the words for you.	Doch it foar jo wurden of de wurden foar jo.
Go back to bed.	Gean werom op bêd.
He was not sure what he was ready for.	Hy wie net wis wêr't er klear foar wie.
But they are different from us.	Mar se binne oars as wy.
She should not have said it, she knew.	Se hie it net sizze moatten, wist se.
Nobody knows the reason.	Nimmen wit de reden.
But this one did.	Mar dizze die.
The question is what.	De fraach is wat.
She wasn't sure she could do it herself.	Se wie der net wis fan dat se sels koe.
You have the word and the word has you.	Jo hawwe it wurd en it wurd hat dy.
Come on, you know it is.	Kom op, jo witte dat it is.
Home or office, it does not matter.	Thús of kantoar, it makket neat út.
So have you.	Sa hawwe jo.
He comes back to life.	Hy komt werom ta it libben.

The man was not sitting.	De man siet net.
Now we had something on hand.	No wiene wy ​​wat oan 'e hân.
Please do not!	Graach net!
Even in the word.	Sels yn it wurd.
But with all that said, it's a difficult problem.	Mar mei al dat sein, it is in dreech probleem.
It's easy to do things.	It is maklik om dingen te dwaan.

He opened the door and entered.	Hy die de doar iepen en kaam der yn.
He did it as soon as he got home.	Hy die it sa gau as er thús kaam.

You asked for it.	Do hast der om frege.
This should not take much time.	Dit moat net folle tiid nimme.

How many years have you worked here?	Hoefolle jier hawwe jo hjir wurke?

Home as soon as he was through.	Thús sa gau as er troch wie.

He came, he saw, he died.	Hy kaam, hy seach, hy stoar.
I totally agree with that.	Dêr bin ik it hielendal mei iens.
Not if they want to.	Net as se dat wolle.

My dad comes home late from work.	Myn heit komt let thús fan it wurk.
I plan to get myself a whole lot really soon.	Ik plan om my in hiele protte echt gau te krijen.

She's always on me.	Se is ek altyd op my.
I love taking things and really making them.	Ik hâld fan dingen te nimmen en se echt te meitsjen.
It's your place.	It is dyn plak.
Work and wait.	Wurkje en wachtsje.
She's not talking about that.	Dêr komt se net oer.
Or try to be.	Of besykje te wêzen.
It's not just about the money.	It giet net allinnich om it jild.
But he is not.	Mar hy is net.

He would not need it anymore.	Hy soe it net mear nedich hawwe.
I will never love such a one.	Ik sil noait fan sa'n ien hâlde.

She was just so scared.	Se wie krekt sa bang.
Glad to get it done.	Bliid om it dien te krijen.
Being here with you is not a good idea.	Hjir by dy wêze is gjin goed idee.
Those are a few, mind you.	Dat binne in pear, tink.
Do not go into the water.	Gean net yn it wetter.
They were just there for it.	Se wiene der krekt foar.
We went into something.	Wy binne der wat yn gien.
But he is none of that.	Mar dêr is hy neat fan.
What a great idea.	Wat in goed idee.
I did.	Ik die.
They ask themselves why.	Se freegje har ôf wêrom.
There was a problem.	Dêr wie in probleem.
But other than that, everything was fine.	Mar oars as dat wie alles goed.
It looked the same as before.	It like itselde as earder.
Everyone always wants more, it's never enough.	Elkenien wol altyd mear, it is noait genôch.
In a good way.	In goede manier.
He has been very nice.	Hy hat hiel aardich west.
I think they are beautiful.	Ik tink dat se moai binne.
And to me.	En oan my.
Give me something.	Jou my wat.
More is coming soon.	Der komt gau mear oer.
Let's go.	Lit ús gean.
They love the kids.	Se hâlde fan de bern.
The police were quickly on the scene.	De plysje wie gau op it plak.
Everything happens now.	Alles bart no.
He will go wherever you go.	Hy sil gean wêr't jo hinne geane.
But we do not wait long.	Mar wy wachtsje net lang.
They did and much more.	Dat diene se en noch folle mear.
Now she asked me to go.	No frege se my om te gean.
And it still hurts.	En it is noch altyd sear.
You have not been.	Jo hawwe net west.
She knows his name.	Se wit syn namme.
No word why.	Gjin wurd wêrom.
I will almost certainly.	Ik sil hast wis.
I do not want to be again.	Ik wol net wer wêze.
It must.	It moat.
When are we leaving?	Wannear geane wy ​​fuort?
Glad you took your time.	Bliid dat jo jo tiid nimme.
They talk about their day.	Se prate oer har dei.
We do not have a dog.	Wy hawwe gjin hûn.
The truth will set you free.	De wierheid sil jo frij meitsje.
This is what they are trying to do.	Dit besykje se te dwaan.
They do something different.	Se dogge wat oars.
Such a thing must have happened.	Sa'n ding moat bard wêze.
Plan on it.	Plan derop.
Many people ask me when to buy.	In protte minsken freegje my wannear te keapjen.
He was good enough to say so much.	Hy wie goed genôch om safolle te sizzen.
I also want a name.	Ik wol ek in namme.
I do not need anyone else.	Ik haw gjinien oars nedich.
Do everything in His name.	Doch alles yn syn namme.
Then something happens.	Dan bart der wat.
I do not see what she should be happy about.	Ik sjoch net wêr't se bliid fan wêze moat.
And it will happen soon.	En it sil gau barre.
All you have to do is wait.	Alles wat jo hoege te dwaan is wachtsje.
No one would believe me.	Nimmen soe my leauwe.
They had it coming, for sure. 	Se hiene it kommen, foar wis. 
It makes everyone better.	It makket elkenien better.
You can keep this better.	Jo kinne dit better hâlde.
She's worked.	Se is wurke.
She has never been to school in her life.	Se hat nea yn har libben nei skoalle west.
And you're in there.	En do bist der yn.
It's going better next week.	It giet nije wike better.
Now let it go, and take me home.	No lit it gean, en nim my nei hûs.
The really young kids, they want you out there with them.	De echt jonge bern, se wolle dy der mei har út.
There are no people.	Der binne gjin minsken.
He was the father of many children.	Hy wie de heit fan in protte bern.
I told him to take it out.	Ik fertelde him om it út te nimmen.
She was not happy.	Se wie net bliid.
That for sure.	Dat foar wis.
I did not know her name.	Ik wist har namme net.
She asked why you were not with her.	Se frege wêrom't jo net by har wiene.
With that being said.	Mei dat sein.
But of course there was one in the house.	Mar der wie fansels ien yn 'e hûs.
That never happens to me again.	Dat bart my noait mear.
I will be back.	Ik sil werom komme.
But we do have some idea.	Mar wy hawwe wol wat idee.
Of course I knew that.	Dat wist ik fansels.
I can only ask.	Ik kin it mar freegje.
I just want to see if anything comes out.	Ik wol gewoan besykje oft der wat út komt.
Maybe, she thought.	Miskien, tocht se.
To the bed.	Nei it bêd.
Let's go back.	Litte wy werom gean.
He shook my hand.	Hy joech my de hân.
For better or worse, this was where she came from.	Foar goed of min, dit wie wêr't se wei kaam.
I was only there for three days.	Ik wie der mar trije dagen.
They could see me.	Se koene my sjen.
Not if anyone makes it.	Net as ien fan it makket.
Do this only once, and never again.	Doch dit mar ien kear, en nea wer.
I can see no reason to continue.	Ik kin gjin reden sjen om troch te gean.
She was ready to leave.	Se wie ree om fuort te gean.
He had been driving for more than an hour.	Hy hie al mear as in oere riden.
Not too sure.	Net al te wis.
I'm a man.	Ik bin in man.
She knew well enough what he was talking about.	Se wist goed genôch wêr't er it oer hie.
And it just looks really good too.	En it liket der gewoan ek hiel goed út.
He told me that our parents were not really our parents.	Hy fertelde my dat ús âlden net echt ús âlden wiene.
And we need to do something about your name.	En wy moatte wat dwaan oan dyn namme.
So we win.	Sa winne wy.
Many had not eaten for a week.	In protte hiene in wike net iten.
She knew exactly what she wanted.	Se wist krekt wat se woe.
Either way, buy this book.	Hoe dan ek, keapje dit boek.
Did no one tell you to be careful?	Hat nimmen jo sein om foarsichtich te wêzen?
No one was found there.	Dêr waard gjinien fûn.
She was one of my favorite people back in the day.	Se wie ien fan myn favorite minsken werom yn 'e dei.
He could tell she wanted to say more.	Hy koe fertelle dat se mear sizze woe.
Or you.	Of jo.
And so it will be.	En sa sil it wêze.
The car looks better than the day she bought it.	De auto sjocht der better út as de dei dat se it kocht.
He wanted to stay in.	Hy woe yn bliuwe.
So we decided to get rid of him.	Dat wy besletten om fan him ôf te kommen.
No one can know.	Nimmen kin it witte.
So she would talk.	Sa soe se prate.
Someone has it.	Immen hat it.
That's all that matters.	Dat is alles wat der ta docht.
I'm not good at this.	Ik bin hjir net goed yn.
They did not ask for it.	Se hawwe der net om frege.
The other family had none of that.	De oare famylje hie dêr neat fan.
They love everything they want or anyone can be.	Se hâlde fan alles wat se wolle of elkenien wêze kinne.
It was clear.	It wie dúdlik.
She thought about it.	Se tocht der oer nei.
No thing.	Gjin ding.
You think of nothing but your food.	Jo tinke oan neat oars as jo iten.
I read it.	Ik ha it lêzen.
If you have to go, just go.	As jo ​​moatte gean, gewoan gean.
Let that go too.	Lit dat ek gean.
Could not even get along well with a friend.	Koe it net iens goed krije mei in freon.
Keep that in mind.	Hâld dat yn gedachten.
Never seen that place.	Nea sjoen dat plak.
So we have to keep worrying.	Sa moatte wy soargen bliuwe.
But not this woman.	Mar net dizze frou.
Let's try to be all three together.	Litte wy besykje alle trije tegearre te wêzen.
She knew the car was near my house.	Se wist dat de auto by myn hûs wie.
He would not say it.	Hy soe it net sizze.
Maybe he didn't have to do anything.	Miskien hoegde er neat te dwaan.
He speaks better.	Hy praat better.
I will try it this weekend.	Ik sil it it wykein besykje.
What you're saying now.	Wat jo no sizze.
You will stay and see them.	Jo sille bliuwe en har sjen.
One man.	Ien man.
Where were they ?.	Wêr wiene se?.
Maybe this month will be different.	Miskien sil dizze moanne oars wêze.
I'm not even sure if there's anything to get.	Ik bin der net iens wis fan oft der wat te krijen is.
It's not alone here.	It is hjir net allinnich.
They said two hours.	Se seine twa oeren.
Love your friends.	Hâld fan dyn freonen.
That has never happened before.	Dat is noch noait earder bard.
And not to her mother.	En net oan har mem.
I met him earlier.	Ik moete him earder.
And we can talk a little bit about that.	En dêr kinne wy ​​in bytsje oer prate.
He was gone.	Hy wie fuort.
Nobody tried to talk him out of it.	Nimmen besocht him der út te praten.
We can not be sure.	Wy kinne net wis wêze.
She was too late.	Se wie te let.
I want you to find your children.	Ik wol dat jo jo bern fine.
The other felt differently.	De oare fielde oars.
No city is my home anymore.	Gjin stêd is myn thús mear.
Not the only way.	Net de ienige manier.
They do not even talk to each other again.	Se prate net iens wer mei elkoar.
Maybe it should not.	Miskien moat it net.
Or maybe sooner.	Of miskien earder.
And now that me too.	En no dat ek my.
That's what we've got now.	Dat is wat wy no krigen hawwe.
Too late, too late, too late.	Te let, te let, te let.
He had said he would come, but he was not.	Hy hie sein dat er komme soe, mar hy wie net.
I'm surprised no one else heard it.	Ik bin ferrast dat nimmen oars it hearde.
She lets them be.	Se lit se wêze.
It felt good.	It fielde goed.
And he was just a boy.	En hy wie mar in jonge.
This is wrong.	Dit is ferkeard.
Then here.	Dan hjir.
I have no problem with him.	Ik haw gjin probleem mei him.
We need to tell the police.	Wy moatte it de plysje fertelle.
Next month they want something different.	Takom moanne wolle se wat oars.
They had never lived in a house.	Se hiene nea yn in hûs wenne.
We do not have to be afraid.	Wy hoege net bang te wêzen.
This was last month.	Dit wie ferline moanne.
The police are there now.	De plysje is der no.
Go home if they need you.	Gean nei hûs as se dy nedich hawwe.
I'll get it back.	Ik sil it werom krije.
Both tried and not there.	Beide besocht en dêr net.
She did not expect that from me.	Dat hie se net fan my ferwachte.
Eventually he arrived.	Lang om let kaam er oan.
We've never seen it before and we've never heard of it.	Wy hawwe it noait sjoen en wy hawwe der noait oer heard.
Said it was what she had to do.	Sei it wie wat se moast dwaan.
I thought to accept it.	Ik tocht der oan te nimmen.
It did not happen.	It barde net.
We will be home next year.	Wy sille takom jier thús wêze.
He worked so hard.	Hy wurke sa hurd.
Or even one month.	Of sels ien moanne.
The new is old.	It nije is âld.
I never talked about it.	Ik haw der noait oer praat.
I walked over to her.	Ik rûn nei har ta.
She was not worried.	Se wie gjin soargen.
He loves it.	Hy hâlde der fan.
But he did not leave things there.	Mar hy liet de dingen dêr net.
I came here to get everything.	Ik kaam hjir om alles te krijen.
She did not even know why she had done it.	Se wist net iens wêrom't se it dien hie.
Whatever that was, she wanted it.	Wat dat ek wie, se woe it.
But now you have to look at it.	Mar no moatte jo der nei sjen.
Your mom has never even said she loves me.	Dyn mem hat noch nea iens sein dat se fan my hâlde.
I'm asked a lot about it.	Ik wurd der in protte oer frege.
It was true.	It wie wier.
Everyone made them worry.	Elkenien makke har soargen.
Who's in.	Wa is in.
Anyone can come with you.	Elkenien kin mei dy komme.
But let me tell you this.	Mar lit my dy dit fertelle.
I want to know what they are.	Ik wol witte wat se binne.
There's someone else you need to see.	Der is immen oars dy't jo moatte sjen.
I could not.	Dat koe ik net.
Will tell us nothing.	Sil ús neat fertelle.
Coming back.	Komt werom.
It even goes into a job.	It giet sels yn in baan.
More is needed.	Der is mear nedich.
She said she never did.	Se sei dat se noait dien hat.
We were all scared.	Wy wiene allegear bang.
This is also about us.	Dit giet ek oer ús.
See if this works for you.	Sjoch as dit wurket foar jo.
The party started late.	It feest begûn let.
That's what's going on.	Dat is wat der oan de hân is.
Reading is my life.	Lêzen is myn libben.
I just wanted to see what would happen.	Ik woe gewoan sjen wat der barre soe.
It was about three years ago.	It wie sa'n trije jier lyn.
I would be very happy to be wrong about that !.	Ik soe tige bliid wêze om dêr ferkeard oer te wêzen!.
Let no one know you're here.	Lit gjinien witte dat jo hjir binne.
And he almost got it.	En hy krige it hast.
If you were, it would not be.	As jo ​​wiene, soe it net wêze.
Let her do her job.	Lit har har wurk dwaan.
If anything.	As der wat wie dy.
It was a reason, but not the only one.	It wie in reden, mar net de ienige.
They ask about your last job, and how you did it.	Se freegje oer jo lêste baan, en hoe't jo dien hawwe.
But the questions are different.	Mar de fragen binne oars.
He made that himself.	Dat hat er sels makke.
No one could do that anymore.	Nimmen koe dat mear dwaan.
Of course.	Fansels.
I would never let that happen.	Ik soe dat nea barre litte.
It was scary for you.	It wie bang foar dy.
See, this whole thing should never have happened.	Sjoch, dit hiele ding hie nea barre moatten.
If you stay.	As jo ​​bliuwe.
We do not know about tomorrow.	Wy witte net oer moarn.
But let's not stop there.	Mar litte wy dêr net ophâlde.
We have to go.	Wy moatte gean.
Pick them up and give me one.	Nim se op en jou my ien.
It was a lot of work.	It wie in protte wurk.
She looked really nice.	Se seach echt aardich út.
Maybe that's all it is.	Miskien is dat alles wat dit is.
There is no reason to do it here.	D'r is gjin reden om it hjir te dwaan.
This was the last.	Dit wie de lêste.
We will always be here for you.	Wy sille hjir altyd foar jo wêze.
I came back home after doing the work.	Ik kaam werom nei hûs nei it dwaan fan it wurk.
What could be better!?.	Wat kin better!?.
I'm just a guy who knows something.	Ik bin gewoan in keardel dy't wit wat.
You know what you did.	Jo witte wat jo dien hawwe.
There is nothing else in town.	Der is neat oars yn 'e stêd.
You can take them.	Jo kinne se nimme.
She says now is not a good time.	Se seit dat no gjin goede tiid is.
We need to talk.	Wy moatte prate.
They need to be able to help you.	Se moatte jo helpe kinne.
He has never really been anything like what or how he is.	Hy hat noait echt wat west as wat of hoe hy is.
She looked different now.	Se seach der no oars út.
I wish you the best.	Ik winskje dy it bêste.
One is that you go and buy it from the past.	Ien is dat jo geane en keapje it út it ferline.
Everyone knows now.	Elkenien wit no.
It was not the thing done.	It wie net it dien ding.
She told him she would look into it.	Se fertelde him dat se der nei sjen soe.
It becomes difficult for her.	It wurdt har dreech.
But it is.	Mar it is wol.
Or maybe both.	Of miskien beide.
How different our lives would have been.	Hoe oars soe ús libben west hawwe.
Well, come on in.	No, kom yn.
Do what you think is right.	Doch wat jo tinke is goed.
It was just an animal, of course.	It wie mar in bist, fansels.
Will be back in your place.	Sil wer op jo plak wêze.
It was yesterday, actually.	It wie juster, eins.
With him you never knew.	Mei him wisten jo noait.
That is what is a truth.	Dat is wat in wierheid is.
I love this one too.	Ik hâld fan dizze ek.
Now more, even then.	No mear, sels dan dat.
And she was scared.	En se wie bang.
That's what he always told me.	Dat hat er my altyd ferteld.
He does not give up.	Hy lit net op.
I still remember hearing this.	Ik wit noch dat ik dit hearde.
He lives an hour away from the city.	Hy wennet in oere fuort fan 'e stêd.
It was really clear.	It wie echt dúdlik.
Just happy to see you.	Krekt bliid om dy te sjen.
He can do anything.	Hy kin alles dwaan.
Does this well.	Docht dit goed.
And it's your movie, that's good.	En it is dyn film, dat is goed.
Everything went according to plan.	Alles gie nei plan.
And maybe he can.	En miskien kin er.
But it is nothing else.	Mar it is neat oars.
They already know that.	Dat witte se al.
I just did not hear them.	Ik hearde se gewoan net.
There was just no way in.	Der wie gewoan gjin wei yn.
Maybe it's not with us anymore either.	Miskien is it ek net mear by ús.
They would never get anything done.	Se soene noait wat dien krije.
In just three days.	Yn mar trije dagen.
I am tired.	Ik bin wurch.
You never know what you'll get!	Jo witte noait wat jo krije!
What he did not know was why.	Wat hy net wist wie wêrom.
Let's say so.	Litte wy it sa sizze.
But it would not come.	Mar it soe net komme.
I never tried to find my mother.	Ik haw noait besocht myn mem te finen.
It did not seem so.	It like der net ta.
They can not help you.	Se kinne jo net helpe.
There was something about the room that scared me.	Der wie wat oer de keamer dat my bang makke.
I think it was not good for that.	Ik tink dat it dêr net goed foar wie.
I got a new one this year.	Ik krige dit jier in nije.
My father died on the last day of school.	Myn heit stoar op de lêste dei fan skoalle.
No more reading it all anymore.	Gjin lêzen it allegear mear.
I went to work that day.	Ik gie dy dei oan it wurk.
I never wanted to tell anyone.	Ik woe it noait oan ien fertelle moatte.
It's going on though.	It giet wol troch.
Everything is coming out now.	Alles komt no út.
That will keep us going.	Dat sil ús hâlde.
I was whole.	Ik wie hiel.
But you have to come.	Mar jo moatte komme.
He does this kind of thing a lot.	Hy docht dit soarte dingen in protte.
I want you to help me.	Ik wol dat jo my helpe.
You come through.	Jo komme troch.
Not with me.	It mei my net.
We're talking about this.	Wy hawwe it oer dit.
How is it.	Hoe is it.
You have to give it one.	Jo moatte it ien jaan.
Everyone knew that.	Elkenien wist dat.
He was tall and looked good.	Hy wie lang en seach goed út.
He's just there for me.	Hy is der gewoan foar my.
One that is not beautiful.	Ien dy't net moai is.
You knew better.	Jo wisten better.
You can do such a thing.	Jo kinne sa'n ding dwaan.
But now, here you are again.	Mar no, hjir binne jo wer.
A man was found in his car.	Der is in man fûn yn syn auto.
I'm trying to find them.	Ik besykje se te finen.
I want to have a word with you about that.	Dêr wol ik in wurd mei dy oer hawwe.
Nothing really happened.	Der barde echt neat.
The sooner we go, the better.	Hoe earder wy geane, hoe better.
It was never easy to get away.	It wie noait maklik om fuort te gean.
It may be true.	It kin wier wêze.
You know for sure.	Jo witte der wis fan.
Everyone knows about you.	Elkenien wit oer dy.
Life.	Libben.
This city is	Dizze stêd is
They can help something.	Se kinne wat helpe.
I just did not know how and why.	Ik wist gewoan net hoe en wêrom.
And it will do nothing.	En it sil neat dwaan.
But it works pretty well exactly the same.	Mar it wurket frij goed krekt itselde.
It's a bad month.	It is in minne moanne.
She is not the only one.	Se is net de ienige.
He had to be careful here.	Hy moast hjir foarsichtich wêze.
Then this had not happened.	Dan wie dit net bard.
No work for you there.	Gjin wurk foar jo dêr.
They find what they need in each other.	Se fine wat se nedich binne yn elkoar.
His family did not know where he was.	Syn famylje wist net wêr't er wie.
We just did it to do it.	Wy diene it gewoan om it te dwaan.
I was just a man.	Ik wie mar in man.
They had your name, he says.	Dy hiene dyn namme, seit er.
We were almost out of food.	Wy wiene hast út iten.
He will go with you if you want.	Hy sil mei jo gean as jo wolle.
He wants you to believe him.	Hy wol dat jo him leauwe.
I will not be back.	Ik sil net werom wêze.
What to eat.	Wat te iten.
I really liked it.	Ik fûn it tige leuk.
This year he had run out of no one.	Dit jier wie hy út gjinien rûn.
We should both do it in a few days.	Wy soene it beide in pear dagen dwaan moatte.
Things will be different.	Dingen sille oars.
I know it is.	Ik wit it is.
I did not expect that we would.	Ik hie net ferwachte dat wy soene.
But, it's still hard.	Mar, it is noch altyd dreech.
That's right there.	Dat is krekt dêr.
No one had told me to leave.	Nimmen hie my sein om fuort te gean.
That's exactly what we'll do.	Dat sille wy krekt dwaan.
I thought only.	Ik tocht allinnich.
And now they knew it would not.	En no wisten se dat it net soe.
I can not hold it.	Ik kin it net hâlde.
All your friends are in town.	Al jo freonen binne yn 'e stêd.
I need to get everything just right.	Ik moat alles krekt goed krije.
She had to get to work.	Se moast oan it wurk.
He knew what to do.	Hy wist wat er dwaan moast.
I agree with you there.	Ik bin it dêr mei dy iens.
Maybe my wife.	Miskien myn frou.
The woman knew nothing about it.	De frou wist der neat fan.
I was good.	Ik wie goed.
Want to hear a lot.	Wol in protte heard.
The car is still what it is.	De auto is noch altyd wat it is.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
And, of course, you win.	En, fansels, jo winne.
Not for her.	Net foar har.
If he had heard that, then what he had heard was wrong.	As er dat heard hie, dan wie wat er heard hie ferkeard.
It's about what he's asked.	It giet om wat him frege wurdt.
Try to be one of those people.	Besykje ien fan dy minsken te wêzen.
It's more than a car.	It is mear as in auto.
This seemed too good to be true.	Dit like te moai om wier te wêzen.
I asked him my name.	Ik frege him myn namme.
And we're still here.	En wy binne hjir noch.
I made nothing out of it.	Ik makke der neat út.
You think he's the good guy.	Jo tinke dat hy de goede keardel is.
There you can see everything.	Dêr kinne jo fan alles sjen.
It should have been easy.	It hie maklik wêze moatten.
I was looking forward to it getting better.	Ik seach der út nei dat it better soe wurde.
He is at home with his wife.	Hy is thús mei syn frou.
Mom knows it will.	Mem wit it wol.
It can still come to nothing.	It kin noch op neat komme.
Well, a few things.	Goed, in pear dingen.
You can not help it.	Jo kinne it net helpe.
It's not hard to see.	It is net dreech om te sjen.
Well, you know, everyone does it.	No, jo witte, elkenien docht it.
Just wait and see.	Wachtsje dêr mar op.
I'm asking you something.	Ik freegje dy wat.
I came here to talk to you.	Ik kaam hjir om mei dy te praten.
I could not work.	Ik koe net wurkje.
I never believe them.	Ik leau se noait.
He got it.	Hy hat it krigen.
I really do not want to talk about it.	Ik wol der echt net oer prate.
And so much more.	En safolle mear.
You still do not really know what it's about.	Jo witte noch net echt wêr't it oer giet.
There is a lot of both in everyone.	D'r is in protte fan beide yn elkenien.
I have worked with them.	Ik haw mei har wurke.
Maybe.	Miskien.
But maybe there was no need to worry.	Mar miskien wie der gjin soargen nedich.
I found him.	Ik haw him fûn.
He does it too.	Hy docht it ek.
But that did not worry him.	Mar dat makke him gjin soargen.
He found the door.	Hy fûn de doar.
He just would not do it.	Hy soe it gewoan net dwaan.
You do not really need me.	Jo hawwe my net echt nedich.
I still looked like a child.	Ik like noch as in bern.
We are just too.	Wy binne ek gewoan.
It happened a long time ago.	It barde lang lyn.
He looked really good.	Hy seach der echt goed út.
I did not know what the thing was.	Ik wist net wat it ding wie.
Well, she does not.	No, dat docht se net.
He would not look at me.	Hy soe net nei my sjen.
He knows everything.	Hy wit alles.
I saw him go there every day.	Ik seach him der alle dagen hinne gean.
He wants them to get what comes to them.	Hy wol dat se krije wat har komt.
Where he is when he's not with you.	Wêr't hy is as hy net by dy is.
I can not stop it anymore.	Ik kin it net mear ophâlde.
You stay right here.	Jo bliuwe hjir krekt.
That's what started it, but it's not.	Dat is wat dingen begûn, mar dat is it net.
This time it did not go so well.	Dizze kear gie it net sa goed.
She saw what he had done.	Se seach wat er dien hie.
I went away without waking you up.	Ik gie fuort sûnder dy wekker te meitsjen.
He the I.	Hy die ek.
It may not be likely, but it does happen.	It kin net wierskynlik wêze, mar it bart wol.
He says he was waiting for us to come.	Hy seit dat er op ús wachte om te kommen.
Give me an hour, okay?	Jou my in oere, goed?
We went there last year.	Wy binne der ferline jier hinne gien.
We hope you find them easy to make.	Wy hoopje dat jo se maklik sille fine om te meitsjen.
She hoped she could do the same for her children.	Se hope dat se itselde dwaan koe foar har bern.
He looked around in the water and saw nothing.	Hy seach yn it wetter om en seach neat.
For the same reason.	Om deselde reden.
But for him, it had to be true.	Mar foar him moast it wier wêze.
I hope you are doing well.	Ik hoopje dat it goed mei jo giet.
Which was actually good for me.	Wat wie eins goed foar my.
Must have them.	Moat se hawwe.
But today will be different.	Mar hjoed sil oars wêze.
And there is nothing of them.	En der is neat fan har.
And this is it.	En dit is it.
I was just too happy to come out of such a house.	Ik wie mar al te bliid om út sa'n hûs te kommen.
I do not know what else to say.	Ik wit net wat ik oars moat sizze.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe te dwaan dit.
Few if any will know it.	In pear as ien sil it witte.
Buy this book.	Keapje dit boek.
That means a good one.	Dat wol sizze in goede.
But here it does matter.	Mar hjir docht it wol ta.
Probably had been.	Wierskynlik hie west.
Has a lot of his.	Hat in protte fan syn.
It was hard work.	It wie hurd wurk.
For more than two years now.	Al mear as twa jier no.
The work is busy here.	It wurk is hjir drok.
I bought a few things.	Ik kocht in pear dingen.
It was not there.	It wie der net.
I would not worry.	Ik soe gjin soargen meitsje.
We often talk about you and hope you try.	Wy prate faak oer jo en hoopje dat jo besykje.
So much so that they were hard to keep up with.	Safolle wiene se dreech om by te hâlden.
He has a dog with him.	Hy hat in hûn by him.
So hard.	Sa dreech.
You can come this evening for the money.	Jo kinne dizze jûn foar it jild komme.
She just could not let go.	Se koe har gewoan net litte litte.
My kids too.	Myn bern ek.
I found something obvious.	Ik fûn wat fansels.
This is so beautiful.	Dit is sa moai.
Why he had spoken, he did not know.	Wêrom't er praat hie, wist er net.
They were just as good.	Se wiene krekt sa goed.
We have been here.	Wy hawwe hjir west.
I had never seen her before.	Ik hie har noch noait earder sjoen.
Still was, if you want to know.	Noch altyd wie, as jo wolle witte.
I have two questions.	Ik haw twa fragen.
It's very ordinary.	It is hiel gewoan.
And her for the man.	En har foar de man.
I can not tell you anything.	Ik kin dy neat sizze.
She had found them.	Se hie se fûn.
She just had to go home.	Se hie gewoan nei hûs moatten.
It does not happen.	It bart net.
Only soon, please.	Allinnich gau, asjebleaft.
It was not even thought.	It wiene net iens gedachten.
Everyone knows this is not possible.	Elkenien wit dat dit net kin.
You're a good girl, she said.	Do bist in goed famke, sei se.
But he wanted them.	Mar hy woe se wol.
But not in this way.	Mar net op dizze manier.
But he was there.	Mar hy wie der.
I think you are too.	Ik tink dat jo ek binne.
Every day the same people in this place.	Alle dagen deselde minsken op dit plak.
Of course he could.	Fansels koe hy.
We do not do that.	Dat dogge wy net.
That was absolutely true.	Dat wie hielendal wier.
Tell her everything you need to say.	Fertel har alles wat jo sizze moatte.
You do not have to worry about it.	Jo hoege jo gjin soargen te meitsjen.
He did not have much time.	Hy hie net folle tiid.
No more how it works.	Net mear hoe't it wurket.
When he was not there, he worked.	Doe't er der net wie, wurke er.
And that's not it.	En dat is net.
We just want to win.	Wy wolle gewoan winne.
But it's not your problem.	Mar it is net dyn probleem.
It's fun	It is leuk
I think he does a very good job.	Ik tink dat hy in heul goed wurk docht.
She was good.	Se wie goed.
We need to get that done.	Wy moatte dat dien krije.
And they did.	En dat diene se wol.
Do not do it or you will be done.	Doch it net, of jo binne klear.
Enter your room and come with me.	Jou dyn keamer op en kom mei my.
And first, it was beautiful.	En earst wie it moai.
He was now as good as his word.	Hy wie no sa goed as syn wurd.
I can see that.	Dat kin ik sjen.
But she had to do so much.	Mar se moast safolle dwaan.
But it should not have been him.	Mar it hie him net wêze moatten.
They know where they have been.	Se witte wêr't se west hawwe.
Very few people know who my family is.	Hiel pear minsken witte wa't myn famylje binne.
You should have stayed with me.	Do hiest by my bliuwe moatten.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Wy kinne der neat oan dwaan.
I would not want to come.	Ik soe net komme wolle.
I'm sure of that.	Ik meitsje der wis fan.
If you have to.	As jo ​​moatte.
That's fine with me.	Dat is goed mei my.
However, he always works.	Hoe dan ek, hy wurket altyd.
It is nothing more than that.	It is neat mear as dat.
It was just too true.	It wie mar al te wier.
He looked nice.	Hy seach aardich út.
He was not sure it would do any good.	Hy wie der net wis fan dat it goed dwaan soe.
A good friend, myself.	In goede freon, sels.
He just wanted to look at it.	Hy soe der mar nei sjen wolle.
Today, we know much more.	Hjoed, wy witte folle mear.
But so it can not.	Mar sa kin it net.
She could not make it herself.	Se koe it sels net meitsje.
Not after what they did to me.	Net nei wat se my dien hawwe.
We never get there on time when we do this!	Wy komme der noait op 'e tiid as wy dit dogge!
I was not.	Ik wie it net.
It may not be easy, but it can be done.	It kin net maklik wêze, mar it kin dien wurde.
He would be home in a week.	Hy soe oer in wike thús wêze.
It may even be necessary.	It kin sels nedich wêze.
Tonight it's too much.	Jûn is it te folle.
He says one thing and you say he did not say it.	Hy seit ien ding en jo sizze dat hy it net sein hat.
Not in my name !.	Net op myn namme!.
Well, get out there, the couple.	No, kom der út, it pear.
That is not good for anyone, none of us.	Dat is net goed foar gjinien, gjinien fan ús.
I'm actually the same way.	Ik bin eins op deselde manier.
I have not seen her since, and would not.	Ik haw har sûnt net sjoen, en soe net wolle.
The time is coming, he thought.	De tiid komt der oan, tocht er.
And he saw that they should stay with this man.	En hy seach dat se by dizze man bliuwe moatte.
I did not even know that.	Dat wist ik net iens.
I did that myself.	Dat haw ik sels dien.
No one can tell any of us anything.	Nimmen kin ien fan ús wat fertelle.
You talked to him.	Do hast mei him praat.
They do not have to be good at it.	Se hoege der net goed yn te wêzen.
This would happen.	Dit soe barre.
But they are not there now.	Mar se binne der no net.
Her friend would know what to do.	Har freon soe witte wat se dwaan moast.
I would not ask for help or things.	Ik soe net freegje om help of dingen.
And tomorrow too.	En moarn ek.
It could still.	It soe noch kinne.
She could not stay here long.	Se koe hjir net lang bliuwe.
That we need to do something good.	Dat wy moatte wat goed dwaan.
And look at them.	En sjoch se.
You know why.	Jo witte wêrom.
They get it away.	Se krije it fuort.
We did pretty well.	Wy hawwe it aardich goed.
It must be late.	It moat let wêze.
No one can do that.	Gjin kin dwaan.
Or, very often, both.	Of, hiel faak, beide.
I can be that man.	Ik kin dy man wêze.
It was time for her to leave.	It wie tiid foar har om fuort te gean.
What is the right way to do this?	Wat is de goede manier om dit te dwaan.
We find them both.	Wy fine se beide.
I do that.	Ik doch dat.
Wish I was a girl in there.	Wol dat ik der in famke yn bin.
It hurts so much to see him like that.	It docht sa sear om him sa te sjen.
A man, to be very good.	In man, om tige goed te wêzen.
Even never been.	Sels noait west.
But you can not return.	Mar jo kinne net werom.
For her or himself.	Foar har of himsels.
He did not go back to work.	Hy gie net wer oan it wurk.
If you only knew it, you would not say it.	As jo ​​it mar wisten, soene jo dat net sizze.
I was good.	Ik wie goed.
I do not have too many friends.	Ik haw net te folle freonen.
I think a lot of people do.	Ik tink dat in protte minsken dogge.
How many people live here?	Hoefolle minsken wenje hjir?
It will be hard for me when you come back here.	It sil my dreech wurde, as jo hjir werom komme.
She asked for my name.	Se frege om myn namme.
One last time.	Ien lêste kear.
That can not be.	Dat kin net.
I'm not going back with you.	Ik gean net mei dy werom.
He has it right here.	Hy hat it hjir krekt.
It could be an animal, it could be a car.	It koe in bist wêze, it koe in auto wêze.
He loves his father very much.	Hy hâlde tige fan syn heit.
That scared me.	Dat makke my bang.
That's when it happens.	Dat is as it bart.
And anyway, there was no one to get to.	En hoe dan ek, der wie gjinien te krijen.
Look at him.	Sjoch him.
They are not who they are.	Se binne net wa't se is.
The boy seemed to want to do better.	De jonge like it wol better te dwaan.
Maybe more time.	Miskien mear tiid.
Now, get ready.	No, meitsje jo klear.
I do not like her much.	Ik hâld net folle fan har.
Maybe she would even say some words.	Miskien soe se sels wat wurden sizze.
It was thought of.	It wie der oan tocht.
I still have a few things to do.	Ik haw noch in pear dingen te dwaan.
He only did his job.	Hy die allinnich syn wurk.
That does not matter anymore.	Dat makket neat mear út.
Either way, you have a plan.	Hoe dan ek, jo hawwe in plan.
Maybe she's having the best life ever now.	Miskien hat se no it bêste libben ea.
I know your wife.	Ik ken dyn frou.
It's not there.	It is der net.
It had happened before though.	It wie wol earder bard.
In a way she was.	Op in manier wie se.
I did not even know how old he was.	Ik wist net iens hoe âld hy wie.
Well, do it if you want.	No, doch it as jo wolle.
He thought they would keep it all to themselves.	Hy tocht dat se it allegear sels hâlde soene.
I can not see them.	Ik kin se net sjen.
I had to be the one who stayed.	Ik moast dejinge wêze dy't bleau.
No problem.	Gjin probleem.
It also did not matter.	It makke ek neat út.
Well, who knows what happened.	No, wa wit wat der bard is.
They can do it themselves.	Se kinne it sels dwaan.
Me and him.	Ik en hy.
Look at me!	Sjoch nei my!
She says it's his.	Se seit dat it fan him is.
I'm fine.	It giet wol.
This is actually true.	Dit is eins wier.
I thought that was it.	Ik tocht dat it dat wie.
Let us not go into that now.	Lit ús dêr no net nei gean.
I'm thinking about this.	Ik tink oer dit.
I agree with you.	Ik mei der wol oer.
He saw some worries.	Hy seach wat soargen.
As a child.	As in bern.
But that's gone now.	Mar dat is no fuort.
Of course they would.	Fansels soene se wol.
People have seen them.	Minsken hawwe se sjoen.
I will be the best woman.	Ik sil de bêste frou wêze.
Sa as no.	Sa as no.
He can not be bought.	Hy kin net kocht wurde.
Do you want to buy here?	Wolle jo hjir keapje?
Getting more was a problem.	Mear krije wie in probleem.
He's a friend.	Hy is in freon.
I know how that is.	Ik wit hoe't dat is.
I'm single.	ik bin ien.
And it's still here.	En it is hjir noch.
It's coming soon.	It komt wol gau.
A man needs to have someone to talk to.	In man moat ien hawwe om mei te praten.
Taking a day off is good.	In dei frij nimme is goed.
It's almost like you're really there.	It is hast as bist der echt.
If you do not believe me, then give it a try.	As jo ​​​​my net leauwe, besykje it dan.
Not more than that.	Net mear dan.
I had worked hard.	Ik hie hurd wurke.
He walks away.	Hy giet fuort nei.
I had been easy enough before.	Ik hie earder maklik genôch.
This is what really happened.	Dit is wat der echt bard is.
I'm glad we do not.	Ik bin bliid dat wy dat net dogge.
People are asking for that.	Dêr freegje minsken nei.
Nobody eats.	Nimmen ite.
It still worked.	It wurke noch.
They were done.	Se wiene dien.
That's her way.	Dat is har manier.
I still remember to this day.	Ik wit noch oant hjoed de dei.
This work was finished.	Dit wurk wie klear.
It's the truth.	It is de wierheid.
I would better try it first.	Ik soe it better earst besykje.
What had happened.	Wat wie der bard.
He could work with these people.	Hy koe mei dizze minsken wurkje.
I've seen some of it.	Ik haw der wat fan sjoen.
Try to keep up.	Besykje te hâlden.
But she never asked for it.	Mar se hat it noait frege.
As if she were a dog.	As wie se in hûn.
We've been here two hours.	Wy hawwe hjir twa oeren west.
She seemed to like the house quite a bit.	Se like it hûs aardich leuk te hawwen.
Please help me figure it out.	Help my asjebleaft it út te finen.
It will stop.	It sil ophâlde.
We can not get there soon.	Wy kinne der net gau komme.
I'm sure that's what you're thinking.	Ik bin der wis fan dat is wat jo tinke oer.
Give me something.	Jou my wat.
They would not even wish this.	Se soene dit net iens winskje.
As a woman.	As frou.
But there is none.	Mar der is gjinien.
The whole thing.	It hiele ding.
Where he had to be, what he had to do.	Wêr't er wêze moast, wat moast er dwaan.
Maybe he can find me something.	Hy kin my miskien wat fine.
There was nothing and no one to see.	Der wie neat en nimmen te sjen.
He did not have it in him.	Hy hie it net yn him.
They go to work, they go home.	Se geane nei it wurk, se geane nei hûs.
That alone was enough to hold him back.	Dat allinnich wie genôch om him werom te hâlden.
She needs to know everything.	Se moat alles witte.
What happened to your friend?	Wat is der bard mei dyn freon.
We are now three.	Wy binne no trije.
All in one place.	Alles op ien plak.
The idea is that we get what we want.	It idee is dat wy krije wat wy wolle.
You are spot on.	Jo binne plak op.
I looked up to my parents.	Ik seach op nei myn âlden.
They got everyone.	Se krigen elkenien.
I had done so much.	Ik hie safolle dien.
And the bus came here.	En de bus kaam hjir.
He was gone.	Hy wie fuort.
Glad you're back.	Bliid dat jo werom binne.
This was not entirely true.	Dit wie net hielendal wier.
There is no place for it.	Der is gjin plak foar.
In fact, he's leaving now.	Eins giet er no fuort.
She really liked it.	Se fûn it echt leuk.
That made my day.	Dat makke myn dei.
Have something.	Hawwe wat.
It's just who you are.	It is gewoan wa't jo binne.
This can come with time, and with family.	Dit kin komme mei de tiid, en mei famylje.
No one can ask her.	Nimmen kin har freegje.
He had a few.	Hy hie in pear.
Then look at it.	Dan sjocht der nei.
I just want to get away.	Ik wol gewoan fuort.
There was something left.	Der bleau wat oer.
They were happy to see me.	Se wiene bliid om my te sjen.
Need to.	Moatte.
They do not eat.	Se ite net.
We'll do it that day.	Wy sille it dy dei dwaan.
And not even nearly to be found.	En net iens hast te finen.
I do not like it.	Ik hâld der net fan.
You need to buy it right here, now.	Jo moatte it hjir krekt keapje, no.
How much from your father or from me.	Hoefolle fan dyn heit of fan my.
Nobody wants to.	Nimmen wol.
You scare me.	Jo meitsje my bang.
This is not the problem here.	Dit is hjir net it probleem.
That's what she said, he said.	Dat sei se, sei er.
I will try it soon.	Ik sil it gau besykje.
The whole city was under water.	De hiele stêd wie ûnder wetter.
She made it.	Se makke it.
The same two children.	Deselde twa bern.
I do not really.	Ik net echt.
The whole family.	De hiele famylje.
Exactly the same thing had happened.	Krekt itselde ding wie bard.
My father died for money, he thought.	Myn heit stoar foar jild, tocht er.
This was what he wanted his life to be like.	Dit wie wat hy woe dat syn libben wêze soe.
But it's not ready yet.	Mar it is noch net klear.
The big day.	De grutte dei.
I looked around but no one could see.	Ik seach om my hinne mar koe nimmen sjen.
Think about your work.	Tink oer jo wurk.
Well, that's what we're doing right now.	No, dat meitsje wy no goed.
I have a wife, two children.	Ik haw in frou, twa bern.
His mother has not yet returned.	Syn mem kaam noch net werom.
I really see this becoming something if you let it go.	Ik sjoch dit echt wat wurde as jo it litte litte.
I put the other things away.	Ik sette de oare dingen fuort.
If it does, let it go.	As it docht, lit it gean.
This is just a nice place to be.	Dit is gewoan in moai plak om te wêzen.
People have tried to do that themselves too.	Minsken hawwe dat ek besocht sels te dwaan.
So far, so good, but man what a day.	Oant no ta giet it goed, mar man wat in dei.
But no one comes for me.	Mar nimmen komt foar my.
By the time he realized this was a woman, it was done.	Tsjin de tiid dat hy realisearre dat dit in frou wie, wie it dien.
I'm not trying to keep up this time.	Ik besykje net iens te hâlden dizze kear.
But one thing she does know.	Mar ien ding wit se wol.
Everyone thought they knew you.	Elkenien tocht dat se dy wisten.
He had tried, but they were not in him why, he did not know.	Hy hie besocht, mar se wiene net yn him wêrom, hy wist net.
But there are some problems.	Mar d'r binne wat problemen.
You have to do your job.	Jo moatte jo wurk dwaan.
The city is busy all the time.	De stêd is de hiele tiid drok.
Almost never, really.	Hast noait, echt.
But the time will come.	Mar de tiid sil komme.
The good thing is that we can still have children.	It goede is dat wy noch bern kinne krije.
That's what he said.	Dat sei er.
It was here, at home.	It wie hjir, by it hûs.
Do your job.	Doch dyn wurk.
You may have heard of him.	Jo hawwe miskien fan him heard.
But his time had come.	Mar syn tiid wie kommen.
It does not matter your idea.	It makket net út dyn idee.
Not too late.	No te let.
How did that come out ?.	Hoe kaam dat út?.
You can not do your job.	Jo kinne jo wurk net dwaan.
It could not.	It koe net.
You asked me to leave a few days ago.	Jo hawwe my in pear dagen lyn frege om te gean.
He did not know what to think of it.	Hy wist net wat er der fan tinke moast.
He was so good.	Hy wie sa goed.
In all minds.	Yn alle gedachten.
It was nothing but fun.	It wie neat oars as leuk.
I really like not thinking.	Ik tink eins graach net.
He loves his children.	Hy hâldt fan syn bern.
Just go away.	Gean mar fuort.
Not your truth.	Net dyn wierheid.
I would be a girl.	Ik soe in famke wêze.
He's doing pretty well now.	Hy docht it no aardich goed.
Do we know each other.	Kinne wy ​​elkoar.
He was not hit.	Hy waard net rekke.
We have to do bad things.	Wy moatte minne dingen dwaan.
Everything was beautiful.	Alles wie moai.
I never had the money.	Ik hie noait it jild.
I'll tell you about that another time.	Dêr sil ik dy in oare kear oer fertelle.
That actually happened that way.	Dat barde eins wol sa.
And will probably.	En sil wierskynlik.
He was not happy to see me.	Hy wie net bliid om my te sjen.
But that is the past and this is now.	Mar dat is it ferline en dit is no.
I do not think he has ever done that.	Ik tink net dat er dat ea dien hat.
I think it should work.	Ik tink dat it moat wurkje.
We were very scared.	Wy wiene tige bang.
Anyway, it's so nice to see them.	Hoe dan ek, it is sa leuk om se te sjen.
A mother, he knew, would want to be with her children.	In mem, wist er, soe by har bern wêze wolle.
Your mother is coming out.	Jo mem komt út.
But the other three.	Mar de oare trije.
Money would not do.	Jild soe net dwaan.
No one asked him a question.	Nimmen frege him in fraach.
And who knows, maybe they will.	En wa wit, miskien geane se wol.
I would have her work for nothing.	Ik soe har wurk foar neat hawwe.
He was very interested.	Hy wie tige ynteressearre.
I need to know.	Ik moat it witte.
Not a woman, but a man.	Net in frou, mar in man.
He never gave up, he never gave up.	Hy joech noait op, hy joech noait op.
What really happened.	Wat is der echt bard.
The name was not mine.	De namme wie net fan my.
I just kept going.	Ik haw gewoan hâlden.
People are not very happy with this plan.	Minsken binne net hiel bliid mei dit plan.
He knew he was.	Hy wist dat hy wie.
I leave it to you.	Ik lit it oan dy oer.
He had children.	Hy hie bern.
Maybe this day.	Miskien dizze dei.
It never came back.	It kaam noait werom.
Of course we let them do this.	Fansels litte wy se dit dwaan.
And his name, and where he goes to school.	En syn namme, en wêr't er nei skoalle giet.
They will be here.	Se sille hjir wêze.
Prison is not enough.	Finzenis is net genôch.
But not like you.	Mar net as jo.
I had to go to work tomorrow.	Ik moast moarn nei it wurk.
None of this was realized.	Gjin fan dit realisearre.
I'm the mother.	Ik bin de mem.
They touched it.	Se rekke it oan.
Just be angry.	Wês gewoan lilk.
It's very easy.	It is hiel maklik.
And that the er.	En dat die er.
Do you know who this man is?	Witte jo wa't dizze man is?
I do not want people to go through the same thing.	Ik wol net dat minsken troch itselde ding moatte gean.
I can not stop worrying.	Ik kin net ophâlde mei soargen.
It just so happened.	It barde krekt sa.
Her mother, her father.	Har mem, har heit.
It's going well with them.	It giet goed mei se.
Let me know if you think it's fun !.	Lit my witte as jo tinke dat it leuk is!.
He thought nothing more about it.	Hy tocht der neat mear oer.
Do not let her give it back.	Lit har it net werom jaan.
Who made it? 	Wa hie it makke?
was now the question.	wie no de fraach.
I do not know exactly how it happens or why it happens.	Ik wit net krekt hoe't it bart of wêrom it bart.
I think he can.	Ik tink dat hy kin.
Do not be afraid.	Wês net bang.
She could not believe it was true.	Se koe net leauwe dat it wier wie.
This did not seem to matter much.	Dit like der net folle út te meitsjen.
You think this is the best thing that has ever happened to you.	Jo tinke dat dit it bêste is dat jo ea bard is.
I did not have any problems with it.	Ik haw der gjin problemen mei hân.
That's wrong.	Dat is ferkeard.
He set off for home.	Hy sette ôf nei hûs.
We will not be a few months.	Wy sille net in pear moanne wêze.
And you will make us so much money.	En jo sille ús safolle jild meitsje.
Now he knew he had done well.	No wist er dat er goed dien hie.
He's better ready.	Hy is better klear.
There was some truth in this.	Der siet wat wierheid yn dit.
But in his mind he did not.	Mar yn syn gedachten die er net.
I hold nothing back.	Ik hâld neat oan.
And in a way it does.	En op in manier docht it.
I, for one, am happy.	Ik, foar ien, bin bliid.
And then she would know it.	En dan soe se it witte.
I have no worries.	Ik haw gjin soargen.
Never had problems before.	Nea hie problemen foar.
She's really good at what she does.	Se is echt goed yn wat se docht.
And many people will come.	En in protte minsken sille komme.
We can not do the city now.	Wy kinne de stêd no net dwaan.
His last.	Syn lêste.
Why do we always do the same things?	Wêrom dogge wy altyd deselde dingen?
It was just too much for him to look at.	It wie him gewoan te folle om nei te sjen.
Not in that car with his parents.	Net yn dy auto mei syn âlden.
I have to be so careful with her.	Ik moat sa foarsichtich wêze mei har.
I know her husband better.	Ik ken har man better.
People get this.	Minsken krije dit.
I'll hurt you.	Ik sil dy sear dwaan.
If you want.	As jo ​​wolle.
There was hope, and faith.	Dêr wie hope, en leauwe.
It's a new day.	It is in nije dei.
First we need to talk.	Earst moatte wy prate.
Help us, please.	Help ús, asjebleaft.
You'll see, it's going well.	Jo sille sjen, it komt goed.
This is where we are.	Dit is wêr't wy binne.
There's the money, he thought.	Dêr sit it jild, tocht er.
It's getting better.	It wurdt better.
That's exactly what we'll do.	Dat sille wy krekt dwaan.
It's not going well with me.	It giet net goed mei my.
I'm not looking at him.	Ik sjoch net nei him.
But that did not happen here.	Mar dat is hjir net bard.
I make it.	Ik meitsje it.
I do not even want to do it.	Ik wol it net iens dwaan.
He looked away.	Hy seach fuort.
I know it myself.	Ik wit it sels.
The word is out on you.	It wurd is út op dy.
Everyone knew everything.	Elkenien wist alles.
He was asked by her question.	Hy waard frege troch har fraach.
Just like that.	Krekt sa.
Nothing is just a word.	Neat is mar in wurd.
A first, she had said.	In earste, hie se sein.
But we do not want any problems.	Mar wy wolle gjin problemen.
And everyone will be against him.	En elkenien sil tsjin him wêze.
He knew he was so much more than that.	Hy wist dat er safolle mear wie as dat.
What did you do after school yesterday?	Wat hast juster nei skoalle dien?
With no problem at all.	Mei gjin probleem hielendal.
Enough is enough.	Genôch is genôch.
Today they were in.	Hjoed wiene se yn.
But she's not sure if she can do it.	Mar se is der net wis fan oft se it kin.
There are more of us.	Der binne mear fan ús.
But that's the best we can do now.	Mar dat is it bêste dat wy no kinne dwaan.
This was fine with me.	Dit wie goed mei my.
He knows what happened.	Hy wit wat der bard is.
That seems to be gone now.	Dat liket no fuort.
Really, we were.	Echt, wy wiene.
I would love to visit her.	Ik soe har graach besykje.
I keep it to him.	Ik hâld it him út.
I know where he may be.	Ik wit wêr't er wêze kin.
And everything is going to show, just like that.	En alles gean te sjen, krekt sa.
I need these for tomorrow.	Ik haw dizze nedich foar moarn.
A lot actually.	In protte eins.
We do not have that today.	Dat hawwe wy hjoed net.
After a week or so, the day arrived.	Nei in wike as wat kaam de dei oan.
Probably a long time ago.	Wierskynlik al lang earder.
No one comes to talk to me.	Nimmen komt om my te praten.
And even more work to do.	En noch mear wurk te dwaan.
The work was finished on time.	It wurk wie op tiid klear.
But they come up so quickly.	Mar se komme sa gau op.
I did well in class.	Ik die it goed yn 'e klasse.
We can and should not do this.	Wy kinne en moatte dit net dwaan.
It does not look good.	It liket net goed.
He just did not want to do it anymore.	Hy woe it gewoan net mear dwaan.
Let's do it this way.	Litte wy it op dizze manier dwaan.
You want to win.	Jo wolle winne.
I'm glad to see you.	Ik bin bliid dy te sjen.
Probably not.	Wierskynlik dogge jo net.
You will not believe it.	Jo sille it net leauwe.
I was too scared to get out.	Ik wie te bang om út te kommen.
She can never go back.	Se kin nea werom.
I need you to know this.	Ik moat dy witte dit.
I do not want my wife to go to work.	Ik wol net dat myn frou oan it wurk giet.
You get two more out.	Jo krije noch twa út.
He told you you can tell me.	Hy fertelde jo dat jo my fertelle kinne.
They buy from people they like.	Se keapje fan minsken dy't se leuk fine.
That's what you find out.	Dat fine jo út.
I know you'm busy.	Ik wit datst it drok hast.
He could not see it now.	Hy koe it no net sjen.
He just wants them to be.	Hy wol allinnich dat se binne.
But then again maybe not.	Mar dan wer miskien net.
You did not know what you were doing.	Jo wisten net wat jo dien hawwe.
But it has been.	Mar it is west.
Many, but not exactly.	In protte, mar net krekt.
We will ask them.	Wy sille se freegje.
He will have both. 	Hy sil beide hawwe. 
There is none.	Der is gjin.
I just did not want to.	Ik woe gewoan net.
She knew the people needed her there.	Se wist dat de minsken har dêr nedich hiene.
That's us.	Dat binne wy.
But probably the same as you.	Mar wierskynlik itselde as jo.
The question was how.	De fraach wie hoe.
He knew it at once.	Hy wist it yn ien kear.
She was not the same person as last week.	Se wie net deselde persoan as ferline wike.
Do what you have to do.	Doch wat jo dwaan moatte.
What we did.	Wat wy diene.
We love that he did not.	Wy hâlde dat hy net dien hat.
I wanted to believe her.	Ik woe har leauwe.
He never came home.	Hy kaam noait thús.
This she had never done before.	Dit hie se noch noait earder dien.
I just want it to happen.	Ik wol gewoan dat it bart.
In bed.	Yn it bêd.
With your book.	Mei dyn boek.
He looked at her.	Hy seach har oan.
And we are good.	En wy binne goed.
These are easy to come by.	Dizze binne maklik te kommen.
This is where you need to be careful.	Dit is wêr jo moatte wêze foarsichtich.
I do not really know.	Ik wit it net echt.
I'm just trying to make the best of it.	Ik besykje der mar it bêste fan te meitsjen.
He had never seen her in such a name.	Hy hie har nea yn sa'n nimme sjoen.
he said.	hy sei.
I got so sick of it.	Ik waard der sa siik fan.
They're coming next month.	Se komme takom moanne.
Never really been good.	Nea goed west echt.
It could not be otherwise.	It koe net oars.
The people in that room worked with me.	De minsken yn dy keamer hawwe mei my wurke.
We are better when we are together.	Wy binne better as wy tegearre binne.
This would be his room.	Dit soe syn keamer wêze.
And himself, of course.	En himsels, fansels.
There is nothing like this at home.	Der is neat as dit thús.
It's this place.	It is dit plak.
I've had it hard enough about it.	Ik haw it der dreech genôch oer hân.
Of course we still do.	Fansels dogge wy noch.
There is no talking to that man.	Der is gjin praat mei dy man.
They could be anything.	Se koene alles wurde.
Or the car.	Of de auto.
She is beautiful too.	Se is ek moai.
Everyone goes home.	Elkenien giet nei hûs.
This is real.	Dit is echt.
She does that every now and then.	Dat docht se sa no en dan.
See or be seen.	Sjoch of wurde sjoen.
I will ask him a lot about other things.	Ik sil him in protte freegje oer oare dingen.
It was too late, much too late.	It wie te let, folle te let.
He is a child.	Hy is in bern.
It has never been good.	It is noait goed west.
I was happy to see it.	Ik wie bliid om it te sjen.
Do not issue them.	Jou se gjin út.
He's coming here.	Hy komt hjir.
But they were also scared.	Mar se wiene ek bang.
If there's something they can get for nothing, they take it.	As der wat is dat se foar neat krije kinne, dan nimme se it.
Let's talk.	Lit se prate.
On this day, one was not.	Op dizze dei wie ien net.
I'll give him a job he can do this time.	Ik sil him in baan jaan dy't er dizze kear oan kin.
She was wrong.	Se wie ferkeard.
He was found.	Hy waard fûn.
And they will not go there as friends.	En se sille der net as freonen hinne gean.
We need to know what happened.	Wy moatte witte wat der bard is.
Everyone else wants for sure.	Elkenien oars wol wis.
There could have been so much happening at that time.	Der koe yn dy tiid safolle bard wêze.
They were bad.	Se wiene min.
And we are sorry.	En it spyt ús.
Work should be work and home should be home.	Wurk moat wurk wêze en thús moat thús wêze.
I don't know why.	Ik wit net wêrom.
I'm leaving now.	Ik gean no fuort.
She told him to leave.	Se fertelde him om ôf te gean.
Your life needs you.	Jo libben hat jo nedich.
And we believe him.	En wy leauwe him.
He did not like that.	Dat mocht er net.
It's a good idea if it works.	It is in goed idee as it wurket.
We do not take what is not of us.	Wy nimme net wat net fan ús is.
I do not think anyone can like me.	Ik tink net dat immen my leuk fine kin.
It so soon.	Dit sa gau.
We do not.	Wy net.
I know what many of you think.	Ik wit wat in protte fan jo tinke.
But the book is more than that.	Mar it boek is mear as dat.
They were too late for the meeting.	Se wiene al te let foar de gearkomste.
And also once again.	En ek noch ien kear.
Those are the people you want.	Dat binne de minsken dy't jo wolle.
Now go home.	Gean no mar nei hûs.
That's for us to help him.	Dat is foar ús om him mei te helpen.
But someone had to do it.	Mar immen moast it dwaan.
None of these things worked.	Gjin fan dizze dingen hat wurke.
I love you like before and even more than before.	Ik hâld fan dy as earder en noch mear as earder.
They do not talk to me.	Se prate net mei my.
It's just among the three of us.	It is gewoan ûnder ús trije.
That is to say, there would still be.	Dat wol sizze, der soe noch wol wêze.
I just want to go back to school.	Ik wol gewoan werom nei skoalle.
Everyone wants money.	Elkenien wol jild.
It was not a good picture.	It wie gjin goede foto.
I did not need.	Ik hie net nedich.
I told him to find out about the man.	Ik fertelde him om út te finen oer de man.
This is how she was.	Dit is hoe't se wie.
Not her thing.	Net har ding.
I think they know that.	Ik tink dat se dat witte.
It was just as good, he felt.	It wie like goed, fielde er.
Here's what we'll be doing.	Hjir is wat wy sille dwaan.
You'll never talk about what happened to anyone here, ever.	Jo sille noait prate oer wat hjir bard is mei ien, ea.
Often, that is what we need to do in this life.	Faak, dat is wat wy moatte dwaan yn dit libben.
I'm glad to be back.	Ik bin bliid om werom te kommen.
Do not talk like that.	Praat net sa.
People do not always know what they need.	Minsken witte net altyd wat se nedich binne.
I'll be fine.	Ik sil goed komme.
They are never wrong.	Se binne noait ferkeard.
I could not get there yet.	Ik koe der noch net hinne.
It was gone.	It wie fuort.
But we need to find a name for ourselves.	Mar wy moatte in namme fine foar ús.
Probably more than once.	Wierskynlik mear as ien kear.
They can not speak.	Se kinne net prate.
Never does anyone seem to do that.	Nea liket immen dwaan dat.
That struck me.	Dat joech my oan.
I come three times before he lets me go to work.	Ik kom trije kear foardat hy my oan it wurk gean lit.
It could easily have been from me.	It koe maklik fan my wêze.
It gets tired.	It wurdt wurch.
I do not want to see it.	Ik wol it net sjen.
It was just like in a movie.	It wie krekt as yn in film.
We do not know what to do about it.	Wy witte net wat wy der oan dwaan moatte.
She felt very happy.	Se fielde har tige bliid.
Come back and do three.	Kom werom en doch trije.
I'm interested to be here and see this thing through.	Ik bin ynteressearre om hjir te wêzen en dit ding troch te sjen.
He had many other things to worry about.	Hy hie in protte oare dingen om soargen te meitsjen.
Maybe the whole office.	Miskien it hiele kantoar.
He was not sure why he came.	Hy wie net wis wêrom't er kaam.
But there enough for now.	Mar dêr genôch foar no.
It was a job for life.	It wie in baan foar it libben.
Everything is available.	Alles is te krijen.
We need to know.	Wy moatte it witte.
I wanted to live in that house.	Ik woe yn dat hûs wenje.
That's exactly what happened.	Dat is krekt wat bard.
I was never angry.	Ik wie nea lilk.
And he wanted me.	En hy woe my.
That's very nice.	Dat is hiel aardich.
Your wife is very beautiful.	Dyn frou is tige moai.
There is really work to be done.	Der is echt wurk te dwaan.
We can hope.	Wy kinne hoopje.
If so, you would be wrong.	As dat sa is, soene jo ferkeard wêze.
But it is not.	Mar it is net.
It just happens.	It bart gewoan.
Maybe three times.	Miskien trije kear.
It just seems like it's still standing.	It liket der allinnich op dat it noch stiet.
Hold off a bit.	Hâld in bytsje ôf.
And just like that, the idea comes to him.	En krekt sa komt it idee by him.
One day it may be you.	Op in dei kin it jo wêze.
The one who seemed so happy a few days earlier.	Dejinge dy't in pear dagen earder sa bliid like.
I think it's time for me to go to bed.	Ik tink dat it tiid is dat ik op bêd gean.
Or when they did, it was to say how different she was.	Of doe't se diene, wie it om te sizzen hoe oars se wie.
But he did not want to.	Mar hy woe net.
See what he did.	Sjoch wat er dien hat.
I do not have much to talk about.	Ik ha der net folle oer te praten.
That, they did just that.	Dat, se diene krekt dat.
Think about it this way.	Tink der sa oer.
They would not be there to help us.	Se soene der net wêze om ús te helpen.
We work like this our whole lives.	Wy wurkje ús hiele libben sa.
Is from the police.	Is fan de plysje.
I do nothing.	Ik doch neat.
She knew it meant something to her.	Se wist dat it har wat tinkt.
And probably even more.	En wierskynlik noch mear.
We will not talk about it now.	Wy sille der no net oer prate.
I had never seen this car before.	Ik hie dizze auto noch noait earder sjoen.
Whether you have long.	Oft jo lang hawwe.
A beautiful house.	In moai hûs.
Of course we will.	Fansels sille wy.
Otherwise, you know how difficult it is in this city.	Oars, jo witte hoe dreech it is yn dizze stêd.
Let's go so we can get home.	Litte wy gean dat wy thús komme kinne.
It is clear that they will not do more.	It is dúdlik dat se net mear dwaan sille.
Hope for a better life.	Hoopje op in better libben.
There was no one to keep me there.	Der wie gjinien om my dêr te hâlden.
Must have had it.	Moast it hawwe.
She is tall and beautiful.	Se is lang en moai.
They never talked about it.	Dêr hawwe se it noait oer hân.
Also, there was still nothing of it.	Ek wie der noch neat fan.
He did not want us.	Hy woe ús net.
I have to too.	Ik moat ek.
There was a very bad time.	Der wie hiel min tiid.
Another way.	In oare manier.
It said nothing.	It sei neat.
They were quick to figure out.	Se wiene gau te finen út.
I think we should just wait and see.	Ik tink dat wy gewoan moatte wachtsje en sjen op dat.
On bed he looked out the way, away from her.	Op bêd seach er de wei út, fan har ôf.
A little over a year ago.	In bytsje mear as in jier lyn.
Let's go home.	Litte wy nei hûs gean.
Can anyone help me.	Kin immen my helpe.
You get to see them a lot.	Jo krije se in protte te sjen.
But here, too, something else is at work.	Mar hjir is ek wat oars oan it wurk.
I did nothing.	Ik ha neat dien.
It was a man.	It wie in man.
He seemed very happy with himself.	Hy like tige bliid mei himsels.
Whatever your reason, it's bad.	Wat jo reden ek is, it is min.
But he was not to be seen.	Mar hy wie net te sjen.
How do we do that?	Hoe dogge wy?
I told him all that.	Ik fertelde him dat alles.
Look here, and here, and here.	Sjoch hjir, en hjir, en hjir.
So much you can not.	Safolle kinne jo net.
Let her go and take me.	Lit har gean en nim my.
She was so very happy.	Se wie sa heul bliid.
Do not worry about it.	Meitsje jo der gjin soargen oer.
We also love how beautiful it is.	Wy hâlde ek fan hoe moai it is.
But we know what was really going on.	Mar wy witte wat der echt oan de hân wie.
But the last few days have not been so good.	Mar de lêste dagen binne net sa goed west.
If he could.	As hy koe.
You are the best.	Do bist de bêste.
She's a good girl, really.	Se is in goed famke, echt.
But we have worked hard.	Mar wy hawwe hurd wurke.
Tomorrow would be a day.	Moarn soe in dei wurde.
He's never on time.	Hy is nea op tiid.
The word was out.	It wurd wie út.
They decided to go for tomorrow.	Se besletten om foar moarn te gean.
A good party.	In goed feest.
And hard work is what you have to pay for.	En hurd wurkje is wat jo moatte betelje foar.
Of course I have to stay away from that.	Dêr moat ik fansels fan ôf bliuwe.
I think being with you in bed is good too.	Ik tink dat mei dy op bêd is ek goed.
He just said it.	Hy sei it krekt.
For now, she was fine.	Foar no wie se goed.
You said it before.	Jo hawwe it earder sein.
Show me her.	Lit my har sjen.
And that's fine with me.	En dat is goed mei my.
I can'.	Ik kin'.
He was very different.	Hy wie hiel oars.
I'm not looking back.	Ik sjoch net werom.
Or maybe just leave.	Of miskien gewoan litte.
Then we enter the tour.	Dan geane wy ​​de tocht yn.
Next she did not feel well and wanted to go to bed.	Folgjende fielde se har net goed en woe op bêd.
It was nice to have him here.	It wie moai om him hjir te hawwen.
We have something to do, about this.	Wy hawwe wat te dwaan, oer dit.
It's not happy.	It is net bliid.
I did this.	Ik haw dit dien.
She would never find it again.	Se soe it noait wer fine.
Someone really heard.	Immen hearde echt.
I wanted to see for myself.	Ik woe sels sjen.
He will give you faith.	Hy sil jo leauwe jaan.
She was out of the office all day today.	Se wie hjoed de hiele dei út it kantoar.
But that's exactly why she wants you to help her.	Mar dat is krekt wêrom se wol dat jo har helpe.
So you still have a chance.	Sa hawwe jo noch in kâns.
Not to anyone for any reason.	Net oan immen om hokker reden.
Maybe with a movie.	Miskien mei in film.
I'm not so sure it's true.	Ik bin der net sa wis fan dat it wier is.
We can do it ourselves.	Wy kinne it sels dwaan.
The people who live in this city are many.	De minsken dy't yn dizze stêd wenje binne in protte.
It's three words long.	It is trije wurden lang.
You have to do this.	Jo moatte dit dwaan.
She gave me money.	Se joech my jild.
He walked around, tried them out.	Hy rûn om, besocht se út.
He wanted to leave alone.	Hy woe allinnich litte.
But they are also very wrong.	Mar se binne ek hiel ferkeard.
No time to worry about that right now.	Gjin tiid om der no no oer te soargen.
You can still stay at my house.	Jo kinne noch by my thús bliuwe.
But they are not enough.	Mar se binne net genôch.
Just to.	Gewoan oan.
I've been waiting a very long time.	Ik wachte al hiel lang.
Then the other things are given to you.	Dan wurde de oare dingen jo jûn.
I thought they were very good.	Ik tocht dat se wiene hiel goed.
The man had to ask.	De man moast freegje.
She had seen that movie.	Se hie dy film sjoen.
What we did.	Wat wy dien hawwe.
I'll be fine now.	Ik sil no goed komme.
I have things to do.	Ik haw dingen te dwaan.
Just tell me what you want.	Fertel my gewoan wat jo wolle.
I'm afraid that's the problem.	Ik bin bang dat dat it probleem is.
He can try to drive out.	Hy kin besykje út te riden.
And for good reason.	En foar goede reden.
That gave him away.	Dat joech him fuort.
I was not afraid.	Ik wie net bang.
I think we need them both.	Ik tink dat wy se beide nedich binne.
These can be seen here and here.	Dizze kinne jo hjir hjir en hjir sjen.
We have nothing to eat.	Wy hawwe neat te iten.
It came and went once upon a time.	It kaam en gie eartiids.
But this did not happen.	Mar dit barde net.
I did not really know how to handle it.	Ik wist net echt hoe ik it oan moast.
I would not want you to get in trouble there.	Ik soe net wolle dat jo dêr yn problemen komme.
And so he does.	En sa docht er.
How exactly does she do that?	Hoe docht se dat krekt?
And nothing has.	En neat hat.
You have one.	Jo hawwe ien.
I ask it.	Ik freegje it ôf.
That I will say.	Dat sil ik sizze.
You know nothing about it.	Jo witte der neat fan.
I asked her to go out with me next week.	Ik haw har frege om nije wike mei my út te gean.
Well, it did not matter.	No, it makke neat út.
I've seen what he does for you.	Ik haw sjoen wat er foar dy docht.
She saw me.	Se hat my sjoen.
Of course, your mother does not want this to happen.	Fansels wol dyn mem net dat dit bart.
She had none.	Se hie gjinien.
I was just so happy.	Ik wie krekt sa bliid.
I wanted to have children.	Ik woe bern hawwe.
When he looked like that, he could see it clearly enough.	As er sa seach, koe er it dúdlik genôch sjen.
He was very careful.	Hy wie tige foarsichtich.
He's so good, people.	Hy is sa goed, minsken.
I'm not you.	Ik bin dy net.
We both know what has been done.	Wy witte beide wat der dien is.
I was the only woman in the room.	Ik wie de ienige frou yn 'e keamer.
We've been together ever since.	Wy binne tegearre sûnt.
And we would have no idea where we were.	En wy soene gjin idee hawwe wêr't wy wiene.
They want to know why, and they will ask you.	Se wolle witte wêrom, en se sille jo freegje.
Now too late, he made the best of it.	No te let, dat hy makke der it bêste fan.
We're ready.	Wy binne klear.
Love who you are.	Hâld fan wa't jo binne.
I told him exactly what had happened.	Ik fertelde him krekt wat der bard wie.
I was a young boy.	Ik wie in jonge jonge.
And it's wrong.	En it is ferkeard.
The two met.	De twa moete.
They had come to the door.	Se wiene by de doar kommen.
Or the following.	Of de folgjende.
I agree with that.	Dêr ha ik mei iens.
It was made.	It waard makke.
No one had seen or heard anything.	Nimmen hie wat sjoen of heard.
I did not do it again.	Ik ha it net wer dien.
It's going well with us.	It komt goed mei ús.
Do you know that this is something like us.	Witte jo dat dat wat is as ús.
I had to see him.	Ik moast him sjen.
The couple had no children together.	It pear hie gjin bern tegearre.
But he asked me.	Mar hy frege my.
Not a great opportunity.	Net in grutte kâns.
She had so much to say, if only a little differently.	Se hie safolle sizzen, as mar in bytsje oars.
We have both.	Wy hawwe beide.
You can tell me the truth.	Jo kinne my de wierheid fertelle.
I can not say whether it is true.	Ik kin net sizze oft it wier is.
She had no idea what to make of it.	Se hie gjin idee wat se der fan meitsje moast.
They will, of course.	Se sille fansels wol.
And were still my friends.	En wiene noch altyd myn freonen.
Nobody likes him.	Nimmen liket him.
I'll be there.	Ik sil der oan wêze.
There are many things we can look at.	D'r binne in protte dingen wêr't wy nei kinne sjen.
As if it were made that way.	As wie it sa makke.
Finding a job.	It finen fan in baan.
Friends, he thought to himself.	Freonen, tocht er by himsels.
Whatever he had to say, he did not want to say much.	Wat er ek sizze moast, hy woe it net folle sizze.
And when.	En wannear.
What are the people there.	Wat binne de minsken dêr.
Boy did they make it.	Jonge hawwe se it makke.
She loves me.	Se hâldt fan my.
I was so surprised.	Ik wie sa ferrast.
She will not make it.	Se sil it net meitsje.
This will be difficult for her.	Dit sil har dreech wurde.
Where does all that water go?	Wêr giet al dat wetter hinne?
I will still.	Ik sil noch.
He was sitting in my office.	Hy siet yn myn kantoar.
They lived three hours away.	Se wenne trije oeren fuort.
They would tell it to their parents.	Se soene it har âlden fertelle.
I hope to be everything he wanted to be.	Ik hope alles te wêzen wat hy woe.
And neither do you.	En do ek net.
I also love this time of year.	Ik hâld ek fan dizze tiid fan it jier.
Where is she ever ?.	Wêr se oait?.
Tell me how you like them.	Fertel my hoe't jo se leuk fine.
But you can see.	Mar jo kinne sjen.
But there they were.	Mar dêr wiene se.
It should be ready soon.	It moat gau klear wêze.
Well, here it is.	No, hjir is it.
They can help you.	Se kinne jo helpe.
I was good at that.	Dêr wie ik goed yn.
I'll see what happens.	Ik sil sjen wat der bart.
I feel nothing.	Ik fiel neat.
Neither of us wanted them.	Net ien fan ús woe se.
It would come on time.	It soe op 'e tiid komme.
I can not then.	Ik kin it dan net.
Of course we are not.	Fansels binne wy ​​net.
That's what makes it different.	Dat is wat it oars makket.
They said just be there when they open.	Se seine gewoan wêze dêr as se iepen.
Maybe she was still there.	Miskien wie se it noch.
In a way of talking.	Op in manier fan praten.
From people you knew.	Fan minsken dy't jo wisten.
There must be something.	Der moat wat wêze.
Nobody took a picture, but next time, someone has to.	Nimmen hat in foto makke, mar de folgjende kear moat immen.
They have nothing of the sort.	Se hawwe neat fan it soarte.
It's up to you if you want it.	It is fan jo as jo it wolle.
Is he going to win, not really.	Giet er winne, net echt.
It was out.	It wie út.
Ready for it?	Der klear foar?
I was not happy about it.	Ik wie der net bliid mei.
They do not have to be friends.	Se hoege gjin freonen te wêzen.
It can not be done.	It kin net dien wurde.
Love some of you.	Hâld wat fan dy.
If your teacher does not know it, he is not even a teacher.	As jo ​​​​learaar it net wit, is hy net iens in learaar.
She walked away from the party.	Se rûn fuort fan it feest.
They both did not.	Se hawwe beide net dien.
And it still can.	En it kin noch.
I do not know what you're talking about.	Ik wit net wêr't jo it oer hawwe.
But not twice.	Mar net twa kear om.
I'm not going out.	Ik gean net út.
His father knew that place.	Syn heit koe dat plak.
On the way home she saw her friend.	Op wei nei hûs seach se har freon.
Want to do the same.	Wol itselde dwaan.
You think of her as beautiful.	Jo tinke oan har as moai.
She did not have to speak.	Se hoegde net te praten.
We'll talk to him.	Wy sille mei him prate.
Can someone please help me.	Kin immen my asjebleaft helpe.
Well walked back to the car.	Goed rûn werom nei de auto.
I know nothing of your life.	Ik wit neat fan dyn libben.
I left her alone.	Ik liet har allinnich.
It's obviously hard to come by.	It is fansels dreech om te kommen.
But hard work was still needed.	Mar der wie noch hurd wurk nedich.
It gave us this opportunity.	It joech ús dizze kâns.
One time it happened to me.	Ien kear barde it my.
Or where we do it.	Of wêr't wy it dogge.
There are enough.	Der binne genôch.
But he could not worry about that now.	Mar dêr koe er no gjin soargen oer meitsje.
They are my life.	Se binne myn libben.
This, and nothing more.	Dit, en neat mear.
I was tired too.	Ik wie ek wurch.
There were only three of them.	Dêr wiene mar trije fan.
And he did not.	En dat die er net.
This is getting old fast.	Dit wurdt gau âld.
He looks around.	Hy sjocht om him hinne.
The water boiled in a few hours.	It wetter kocht yn in pear oeren.
Think, madam, think.	Tink, frou, tink.
I saw him think about it.	Ik seach him der oer tinke.
I thought he could play.	Ik tocht dat hy koe spylje.
We went back to those days.	Wy binne werom gien nei dy dagen.
Or not do.	Of net dwaan.
He would go.	Hy soe gean.
Not sure why.	Net wis wêrom.
I still want to try.	Ik wol noch besykje.
After three hours, she arrived.	Nei trije oeren kaam se oan.
Very easy job to have.	Hiel maklik wurk om te hawwen.
But it stayed with him.	Mar it bleau him by.
Waiting for you to come back.	Wachtsje op jo om werom te kommen.
I made it ready for you.	Ik haw it foar dy klear makke.
We were at work.	Wy wiene oan it wurk.
I tried it for the first time yesterday.	Ik besocht it juster foar it earst.
And those people agree.	En dy minsken binne it iens mei.
Life here is difficult.	It libben hjir is dreech.
You have to take good care of it.	Jo moatte der goed foar soargje.
I will talk to him soon.	Ik sil gau mei him prate.
I do not know where that came from, but he was.	Ik wit net wêr't dat wei kaam, mar hy wie.
She was more than late.	Se wie mear as let.
He was her car.	Hy wie har auto.
But not you.	Mar net dy.
A bad place.	In min plak.
I had no worries.	Ik hie gjin soargen.
Do not indicate to be tired.	Jou net oan om wurch te wêzen.
It's the boy.	It is de jonge.
I could not see them.	Ik koe se net sjen.
Someone can say something.	Immen kin wat sizze.
This was what he was waiting for.	Dit wie wêr't er op wachte.
None of us can.	Net ien fan ús kin.
But they can do better.	Mar se kinne better.
But we'm going through it.	Mar wy geane der troch.
Join us today !.	Kom mei ús hjoed!.
I knew him well.	Ik koe him goed.
But of course she never did.	Mar dat hat se fansels noait dien.
Okay, now we're ready.	Goed, no binne wy ​​klear.
Of course, it was a problem.	Fansels wie it in probleem.
Not so.	Net sa.
You have seen.	Jo hawwe sjoen.
He told me he would not pay me.	Hy fertelde my dat hy my net soe betelje.
Not so.	Net sa.
They acted like it was as good as the movie is.	Se diene as it wie sa goed as de film is.
She asked to read it.	Se frege om it te lêzen.
It's not hard to see why.	It is net dreech om te sjen wêrom.
He also said nothing.	Hy sei ek neat.
And there were other things.	En der wiene oare dingen.
Of course they look like him.	Fansels lykje se op him.
But she liked it.	Mar se like it wol.
It would not do anyone any good, in any way.	It soe gjinien goed dwaan, op ien of oare manier.
She came back.	Se kaam werom.
I tried mine.	Ik besocht myn.
This week and next.	Dizze wike en folgjende.
We are not quite sure what happened that day.	Wy binne net hielendal wis wat der barde dy dei.
For the last time.	Foar de lêste kear.
We did not do everything or see what was to be seen.	Wy hawwe net alles dien of sjoen wat der te sjen wie.
Come one by one.	Kom ien foar ien.
But I.	Mar ik.
I'm not sure what to do.	Ik bin der net wis fan wat te dwaan.
I do not think he will.	Ik tink net dat hy sil.
I was careful.	Ik wie foarsichtich.
They are all over it.	Se binne der allegear oer.
I really do not want anyone to know.	Ik wol eins net dat immen it wit.
We can just be here.	Wy kinne hjir gewoan wêze.
He did not say that.	Dat sei er net.
Sit in the car.	Sit yn 'e auto.
The problem is that no one ever knows what to put on them.	It probleem is dat gjinien ea wit wat se op har moatte sette.
One more time.	Noch ien kear.
What is he doing now? 	Wat docht er no?
He could not believe he would do this, however.	Hy koe net leauwe dat er dit dwaan soe, mar.
I have the plan.	Ik haw it plan.
She had said she was in bed and sick.	Se hie sein dat se op bêd wie en siik.
It's good on everything.	It is goed op alles.
I soon saw that it was my father.	Ik seach gau dat it myn heit wie.
They were not afraid.	Se wiene net bang.
To be here.	Om hjir te wêzen.
This is not good.	Dit is net goed.
But no one would know that.	Mar nimmen soe dat witte.
It was over days.	It wie oer dagen.
We still need you.	Wy hawwe dy noch nedich.
It seemed like a good idea.	It like in goed idee.
Otherwise you can not do my work.	Oars kinne jo myn wurk net dwaan.
Everything through the house.	Alles troch it hûs.
It looks like.	It liket derop.
I just can not.	Ik kin gewoan net.
She has to get used to the idea.	Se moat wenne oan it idee.
If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.	As jo ​​​​fragen of soargen hawwe, lit it my dan witte.
I see it every day.	Ik sjoch it alle dagen.
You can tell me which day will work for you.	Jo kinne my fertelle hokker dei foar jo sil wurkje.
I'm sorry I'm back with you so late.	It spyt my dat ik sa let mei dy werom bin.
Of course you can go to school.	Fansels kinne jo nei skoalle.
Not from a woman.	Net fan in frou.
They just know they are doing it.	Se witte gewoan dat se dogge.
But she could not show it.	Mar se koe it net litte sjen.
That's what they do best.	Dat dogge se it bêste.
The first thing he did was ask about my family.	It earste wat hy die wie oer myn famylje freegje.
We do not need to talk about that.	Dêr hoege wy net oer te praten.
Just a little bit away from everyone.	Krekt in bytsje fuort fan elkenien.
Who was the man she came home with?	Wa wie de man mei wa't se thús kaam?
Everyone loves an easy life.	Elkenien hâldt fan in maklik libben.
Her children did not like her.	Har bern hiene har net leuk.
I'm just too happy to help.	Ik bin mar al te bliid om te helpen.
He does a good job.	Hy docht goed wurk.
Do what you can.	Doch wat jo kinne.
But he had no idea how much time he had.	Mar hy hie gjin idee hoefolle tiid hy hie.
In those days, they did not even know what it was.	Yn dy dagen wisten se net iens wat it wie.
Of course, he did not do it alone.	Fansels hat er it net allinnich dien.
A lot of people have done that, and it works.	In protte minsken hawwe makke dat, en it wurket.
You will only be away for a day or so.	Jo sille mar in dei as wat fuort wêze.
The people who live there.	De minsken dy't dêr wenje binne.
But then, no one does.	Mar dan, gjinien docht.
It would be nice to go to your place.	It soe moai wêze om nei jo plak te gean.
We need some time here.	Wy hawwe hjir wat tiid nedich.
You could be so wrong.	Jo kinne sa ferkeard wêze.
The question was what to do about it.	De fraach wie wat der oan te dwaan.
No way did she do this.	Gjin manier hat se dit makke.
It's been a long time.	It is al lang lyn.
There must be something he could do to help his friends.	D'r moat wat wêze dat hy dwaan koe om syn freonen te helpen.
I would love to be loved.	Ik wol graach graach wurde.
He looked at her.	Hy seach nei har.
He's really nice.	Hy is echt aardich.
I did not want to go back to the office.	Ik woe net werom nei it kantoar.
I do not like him.	Ik hâld der net fan om him.
Very well made.	Hiel goed makke.
Maybe she should just go to bed.	Miskien moat se mar op bêd.
Be as good as you are.	Wês sa goed as jo binne.
This was his bad day.	Dit wie syn minne dei.
Maybe a little too much.	Miskien in bytsje te folle.
Leave it there.	Lit it dêr litte.
She did not want to give her a chance to make her hope.	Se woe har gjin kâns jaan om har hope te meitsjen.
He felt a little sick.	Hy fielde him in bytsje siik.
And so it has.	En sa hat it.
And something else.	En noch wat.
Nobody talks about it anymore.	Nimmen praat der mear oer.
It's hard to see.	It is dreech om te sjen.
Her family knows nothing of this.	Har famylje wit hjir neat fan.
But look at the guy.	Mar sjoch nei de keardel.
We hope for the best.	Wy hoopje op it bêste.
She tried them all.	Se besocht se allegear.
She found something, but knew there could be more.	Se fûn wat, mar wist dat der mear wêze koe.
I'm not giving you money.	Ik jou jo gjin jild.
He became ill as a child.	Hy waard siik as bern.
He did not say anything about it.	Hy hat der neat oer sein.
It was clear that this was my life.	It wie dúdlik dat dit myn libben wie.
We leave it.	Wy litte it.
I'll do that if you want me to do that.	Ik sil dat dwaan as jo wolle dat ik dat doch.
One man walking with his dog found him.	Ien man dy't mei syn hûn rûn, fûn him.
It was the last thing she said to him.	It wie it lêste wat se tsjin him sei.
But that's not what you're asking for.	Mar dat is net wat jo freegje.
It was a beautiful thing.	It wie in moai ding.
I told you about it myself.	Dêr haw ik dy sels oer ferteld.
Let it not happen to a person.	Lit it net barre in persoan.
One morning he woke up sick.	Op in moarn waard er siik wekker.
But we are out of time.	Mar wy binne út de tiid.
They get it.	Se krije it.
You know when.	Jo witte wannear.
They are not trying hard enough.	Se besykje net hurd genôch.
She had a job, and liked it.	Se hie in baan, en like it.
But it gets there.	Mar it komt der.
They will find you.	Se sille jo fine.
I'm coming to see.	Ik kom sjen.
So they can believe.	Sa kinne se leauwe.
But do not do that.	Mar doch dat net.
They had started about an hour earlier.	Se wiene sa'n oere earder begûn.
Or was it.	Of wie it.
This was your family.	Dit wie dyn famylje.
I'm sure that the	Ik bin der wis fan dat de
That made two.	Dat makke twa.
Let me tell you what was fun for me.	Lit my fertelle wat wie leuk foar my.
But it is not clear to me.	Mar it is my net dúdlik.
They have children.	Se hawwe bern.
I was afraid you were going there forever.	Ik wie bang datsto dêr foar altyd gien wie.
This was also not expected.	Dit waard ek net ferwachte.
I also know things about you.	Ik wit ek dingen oer dy.
Can or will not.	Kin of wol net.
I do none of these things.	Ik doch gjin fan dizze dingen.
Get over it and get on with your life.	Kom der oer hinne en gean troch mei dyn libben.
He had good reason to be afraid.	Hy hie goede reden om bang te wêzen.
Then we.	Dan wy.
Who he is.	Wa hy is.
He just needs to play.	Hy moat gewoan spylje.
Again and again and again.	Wer en wer en wer.
Believe me.	Leau my.
One man can.	Ien man kin.
I did not want her to see me differently.	Ik woe net dat se my oars seach.
That was about me.	Dat gie oer my.
Both were really good.	Beide wiene echt goed.
She just sat there.	Se siet der mar.
I'm not done.	Ik bin net klear.
You can not have it all.	Jo kinne it net allegear hawwe.
There needs to be more.	Der moatte mear.
I truly believe it.	Ik leau it wier.
His time will come.	Syn tiid sil komme.
I do not want to be here.	Ik wol hjir net wêze.
I know nothing else.	Ik wit neat oars.
This is our chance.	Dit is ús kâns.
Please wait here.	Wachtsje hjir asjebleaft.
That should go.	Dat soe gean moatte.
I love it though.	Ik hâld der wol fan.
She was left with nothing.	Se bleau mei neat.
He set up a meeting.	Hy sette in gearkomste op.
To get it over with.	Om it oer te krijen.
And we'll get that thing out of you.	En wy sille dat ding út dy krije.
It's a big car.	It is in grutte auto.
I'll be sure of that.	Ik sil der wis fan wêze.
I want to look at you again.	Ik wol wer nei dy sjen.
We are not free to talk here.	Wy binne net frij om hjir te praten.
Come back and ask for more.	Kom werom en freegje om mear.
They only get one day a week.	Se krije mar ien dei yn 'e wike.
I just feel.	Ik fiel gewoan.
And what she had just said was true.	En wat se krekt sein hie, wie wier.
I have no idea what you're talking about.	Ik haw gjin idee wêr't jo it oer hawwe.
Never been and never will be.	Nea west en sil nea.
She herself was not sure.	Se wie der sels net wis fan.
I want to be beautiful.	Ik wol moai wêze.
He was unavailable.	Hy wie net te krijen.
There is also a mother.	Der is ek in mem.
They do not go away.	Se geane net fuort.
I will do very well now.	Ik sil it no hiel goed dwaan.
Your life itself.	Jo libben sels.
Until she almost needed to.	Oant se hast nedich hie.
That's nice what it has been.	Dat is moai wat it west hat.
What you did is wrong.	Wat jo dien hawwe is ferkeard.
You are just different from each other.	Jo binne gewoan oars fan elkoar.
The time of year could not hurt either.	De tiid fan it jier koe ek net sear.
He left it.	Hy liet it.
In fact, she knew nothing.	Eins wist se neat.
I am everything, it said.	Ik bin alles, sei it.
How nice of you to come.	Wat moai dat jo komme.
About everything.	Oer alles.
It would have been better to never have them open.	It hie better west se nea iepen te hawwen.
Any questions you have, just ask.	Alle fragen dy't jo hawwe, freegje gewoan.
We used to be best friends.	Wy wiene eartiids bêste freonen.
It can come and go in up to two years.	It kin oant twa jier komme en gean.
Good to see them together.	Goed om se tegearre te sjen.
I'm sure you like living with me.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo graach by my wenje.
And not just because of what it does to them.	En net allinnich om wat it mei har docht.
I know what it's like.	Ik wit hoe't it is.
He was very handsome now.	Hy wie no tige moai.
He wants to tell her.	Hy wol it har fertelle.
I thought nothing of it.	Ik tocht der neat fan.
Well, that's what happened.	No, dit is wat bard.
They would try to talk me into helping them.	Se soene besykje my te praten om har te helpen.
More.	Mear.
Try it.	Besykje it.
Nothing was ever.	Neat wie noait.
In a way it was.	Op in manier wie it.
We leave early.	Wy geane betiid fuort.
I went through the same thing.	Ik gie troch itselde ding.
Even more.	Noch mear.
We would have to pay them, of course.	Wy soene har betelje moatte, fansels.
You can have them.	Jo kinne se hawwe.
It was too easy, this.	It wie te maklik, dit.
Talk to him about what needs to be done.	Praat mei him oer wat der dien wurde moat.
That created a bit of a problem.	Dat makke in bytsje probleem.
We're still at work.	Wy binne noch oan it wurk.
We do a lot there.	Wy dogge dêr in protte.
I believe it's true.	Ik leau dat it wier is.
asked someone.	frege immen.
That work we must do.	Dat wurk moatte wy dwaan.
I did not have to say it twice.	Ik hoegde it net twa kear te sizzen.
See, maybe it's so.	Sjoch, miskien is it sa.
It happens here and there.	It bart hjir en dêr.
He saw her for the first time.	Hy seach har foar it earst.
I'm not done.	Ik bin net klear.
For some reason, that was not a good idea.	Om ien of oare reden wie dat gjin goed idee.
You're out for you now.	Do bist no út foar dy.
There was not much more to be said.	Der moast net folle mear sein wurde.
Just look at him.	Sjoch mar nei him.
This can also work very well.	Dit kin ek hiel goed wurkje.
He had some problems before.	Hy hie earder wat problemen.
But of course you have to.	Mar fansels moatte jo.
But there was nothing to do.	Mar der wie neat foar te dwaan.
Why not just help her out?	Wêrom helpe jo har net gewoan út?
He had a problem last year, he said.	Hy hie ferline jier in probleem, sei er.
I was not sure what it was.	Ik wie net wis wat it wie.
I have lived in this city all my life.	Ik haw myn hiele libben yn dizze stêd wenne.
But there was more to come.	Mar der kaam noch mear.
He never wanted to be.	Hy woe noait wêze.
All she said was that she would find me.	Alles wat se sei wie dat se my fine soe.
Two, get help.	Twa, help krije.
It was more than he could ask for.	It wie mear as er freegje koe.
He did not feel scared.	Hy fielde him net bang.
No one else knows, or will ever know.	Nimmen oars wit, of sil ea witte.
She came through a friend of a friend.	Se kaam troch in freon fan in freon.
He is nothing more to me.	Hy is neat mear foar my.
We need to get it out of here.	Wy moatte it hjir wei.
Things you never go through.	Dingen geane jo net ea troch.
His parents were that too.	Syn âlden wiene dat ek.
Or is it.	Of is it.
I could not find anything better.	Ik koe neat better fine.
Of good days and bad.	Fan goede dagen en min.
We both knew that.	Dat wisten wy beide.
He had never asked.	Hy hie nea frege.
But two things seem clear.	Mar twa dingen lykje dúdlik.
So should you.	Sa moatte jo.
You can see this place.	Jo kinne dit plak sjen.
I did not think they were wrong.	Ik tocht net dat se ferkeard wiene.
I could never tell.	Ik koe it noait fertelle.
No one in that house was okay.	Gjinien yn dat hûs wie goed.
You do not have to do this.	Jo hoege dit net te dwaan.
I love watching her.	Ik hâld fan har te sjen.
But the words were not there.	Mar de wurden wiene der net.
When we did that thing.	Doe't wy dat ding diene.
They probably had better food sooner than otherwise.	Se hiene wierskynlik earder better iten as oars.
It was completely gone.	It wie hielendal fuort.
I did not want to.	Ik woe net.
I need to see you.	Ik moat dy sjen.
He's a good boy, such a good boy.	Hy is in goede jonge, sa'n goede jonge.
I think that would be a problem.	Ik tink dat soe wêze in probleem.
He was surprised.	Hy waard ferrast.
Better said.	Better sa.
Maybe even earlier.	Miskien sels earder.
I was so very, very wrong.	Ik wie sa heul, heul ferkeard.
Do not be afraid.	Wês net bang.
Now he will give you a bad time too.	No sil er dy ek in minne tiid jaan.
Do you still have money left over?	Hawwe jo noch jild oer?
I can not go to him.	Ik kin net nei him ta.
It was very difficult for me.	It wie hiel dreech foar my.
There were a few people eating.	Der wiene in pear minsken oan it iten.
That is actually not true.	Dat is eins net wier.
But there are a few questions.	Mar d'r binne in pear fragen.
They are in mine.	Se binne yn myn.
My whole family is.	Myn hiele famylje is.
So she came back soon.	Sa kaam se gau werom.
She talks about her children.	Se praat oer har bern.
He wanted her, he took her.	Hy woe har, hy naam har.
This was not the work of an animal.	Dit wie net it wurk fan in bist.
And this was just that.	En dit wie krekt dat.
I was not either.	Ik wie ek net.
Tomorrow she's yours.	Moarn is se fan dy.
They do.	Dat dogge se.
Maybe it is not.	Miskien is it net.
I only came once.	Ik kaam mar ien kear.
Everything is wrong.	Alles is ferkeard.
They were not a couple.	Se wiene gjin pear.
That's nice.	Dat is it moai.
I need to be done.	Ik moat dien wurde.
It never stops.	It hâldt noait op.
I'm not so sure about everything.	Ik bin net sa wis fan alles.
We do it a lot.	Wy dogge it in protte.
But it does not work for reading.	Mar it wurket net foar it lêzen.
He does not want to come.	Hy wol net komme.
We can be happy again.	Wy kinne wer bliid wêze.
You said it would for sure.	Jo seine, it soe wis.
Even if you have the best.	Ek as jo it bêste hawwe.
Would she ever be able to.	Soe se oait kinne.
And she's just a child.	En se is mar in bern.
Very happy with me.	Hiel bliid mei my.
He can eat.	Hy kin ite.
I've been doing that for a few years.	Dat doch ik al in pear jier.
I'm a boy.	Ik bin in jonge.
I'm glad you're coming.	Ik bin bliid dat jo komme.
This is more true today than ever.	Dit is hjoed mear wier as ea.
She interested him.	Se ynteressearre him.
They did it, together.	Se diene it, tegearre.
It could, but it did not.	It koe wol, mar it die net.
I saw something more.	Ik seach wat mear.
You have become your parents.	Do bist dyn âlden wurden.
I felt so much better with this way.	Ik fielde my sa folle better mei dizze manier.
There had to be a way he could do something.	Der moast in manier wêze dat er wat dwaan koe.
But there are not.	Mar der binne net.
I will not try to do what they did.	Ik sil net besykje te dwaan wat se diene.
He walked like an old, old man.	Hy rûn as in âld, âld man.
It was not from his mother.	It wie net fan syn mem.
I can no longer speak.	Ik kin net mear prate.
Of course, there is more than that.	Fansels is der mear as dat.
Maybe it's going well this time around.	Miskien komt it dizze kear allegear goed.
I did not think he would tell me.	Ik tocht net dat hy it my fertelle soe.
A difficult thing.	In dreech ding.
He walked away.	Hy gie fuort.
If we do not, we will be here for a long time.	As wy dat net dogge, binne wy ​​hjir lang.
Now it's too late.	No is it te let.
It was soon easy to see why.	It wie al gau maklik om te sjen wêrom.
But, we can not know exactly who they are.	Mar, wy kinne net krekt witte wa't se binne.
I actually know this.	Ik wit dit eins.
Nothing was worth anything.	Neat waard wat.
I think it does.	Ik tink dat it docht.
I do not want you to go.	Ik wol net dat jo geane.
Please, let's try.	Asjebleaft, lit ús besykje.
To her mother.	Oan har mem.
People have done this once before.	Minsken hawwe dat ien kear earder dien.
My dad told me it was a bad idea.	Myn heit fertelde my dat it in min idee wie.
No one will believe you.	Nimmen sil dy leauwe.
There is no money, she said.	Der is gjin jild, sei se.
Do only one.	Doch mar ien.
They ask for food for the children.	Se freegje om iten foar de bern.
This happened last week.	Dit barde ferline wike.
But he was worried.	Mar hy wie soargen.
You are better than other people.	Jo binne better as oare minsken.
Or not really.	Of net echt.
I play better.	Ik spylje better.
You just can do nothing with it.	Jo kinne der gewoan neat mei.
She does what she wants to do.	Se docht wat se wol dwaan.
They can do better, he thought.	Se kinne better, tocht er.
I have to go after things.	Ik moat nei dingen gean.
Will probably be back to get more.	Sil wierskynlik werom wêze om mear te krijen.
You are all my friends.	Jo binne al myn freonen.
It will be difficult.	It sil dreech wêze.
Happy weekend!!.	Goed wykein!!.
But it needs to be done !.	Mar it moat dien wurde!.
The and took money with him.	De en naam jild mei.
That's what I wanted with him.	Dat woe ik mei him.
He was not a man either.	Hy wie ek gjin man.
It worked well at first.	It wurke earst goed.
You obviously do not know what time this is.	Jo witte fansels net hokker oere dit is.
It's so.	It is sa.
I was happy about that.	Dêr wie ik bliid om.
And then it would have been.	En dan soe it west hawwe.
Your mother told me about the party.	Dyn mem fertelde my oer it feest.
Against then.	Tsjin dan.
I would not let you down.	Ik soe dy net litte litte.
A nice read.	In moai lêzen.
Come back to me and such.	Kom werom nei my en sa.
He's wrong again.	Hy is wer ferkeard.
Let it be.	Lit it mar wêze.
They could see it clearly now.	Se koene it no dúdlik sjen.
Just go do it.	Gean dat mar dwaan.
Stop it and you will get there.	Hâld it op en jo komme der.
So you talked a little bit.	Sa hawwe jo in bytsje praat.
Give them to him.	Jou se oan him.
He will come to you.	Hy sil by dy komme.
Just look at you.	Sjoch mar nei dy.
I have much more to say.	Ik haw folle mear te sizzen.
Anything or that he thinks about.	Alles of dat hy tinkt oer.
I was not so ready for this.	Ik wie hjir sa net klear foar.
You did not come.	Do bist net kommen.
Do not be that man.	Wês dy man net.
The thing did not even go away.	It ding gie net iens ôf.
But they are not happy.	Mar se binne net bliid.
There are two of you.	D'r binne twa fan jo.
Be over it.	Wês der oer.
He would never come back there as at home.	Hy soe der nea werom komme as thús.
Tell him how it's going.	Fertel him hoe't it giet.
I'm so looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der sa út nei út.
Whole place up.	Hiel plak op.
I actually did not do much.	Ik ha eins net folle dien.
To take it together.	Om it tegearre oan te nimmen.
You can make them say what you want to say.	Jo kinne meitsje se sizze wat jo wolle sizze.
She told us what she had done.	Se fertelde ús wat se dien hie.
Looks like you know a lot about that girl.	It liket derop dat jo in protte witte oer dat famke.
Not much else has happened.	Der is net folle mear bard.
Give us your idea.	Jou ús dyn idee.
She did not indicate to give his hand.	Se joech net oan om syn hân te jaan.
She did it.	Se hat it dien.
She has it there.	Se hat it dêr.
It was not as difficult as he thought it would be.	It wie net sa dreech as hy tocht dat it wêze soe.
They will say, your father.	Se sille sizze, dyn heit.
That's so hard for me.	Dat is sa dreech foar my.
This time was not such an opportunity.	Dizze kear wie sa'n kâns net.
I think you will.	Ik tink dat jo sille dwaan.
Everyone has their idea of ​​how to do it.	Elkenien hat syn idee fan hoe't jo it moatte dwaan.
I'm not very good.	Ik bin net hiel goed.
I can kind of see why.	Ik kin soarte fan sjen wêrom.
I do not think much of his friends.	Ik tink net folle oan syn freonen.
I was not much help to the police.	Ik wie net folle help foar de plysje.
Be free as water.	Wês frij as wetter.
Need help? 	Help nedich hawwe?
She has good days and bad days.	Se hat goede dagen en minne dagen.
He wanted to make this movie.	Hy woe dizze film meitsje.
Not everyone was happy.	Net elkenien wie bliid.
I was scared of him.	Ik wie bang foar him.
But one day it will.	Mar op in dei sil it wol.
You are always trying to do the right thing.	Jo besykje altyd it goede ding te dwaan.
I'll make a place for you.	Ik sil in plak foar jo meitsje.
I do not think we're still there.	Ik tink net dat wy der noch binne.
And so we did.	En dat diene wy.
I wanted to hurt him back.	Ik woe him sear dwaan werom.
He just asked you to take a good look.	Hy frege dy mar goed te sjen.
I will not be at dinner around that time.	Ik sil om dy tiid net op it iten wêze.
You know how they are.	Jo witte hoe't se binne.
Maybe he just gave us to each other.	Miskien joech er ús gewoan oan elkoar.
He did the only thing he could think of.	Hy die it iennichste dat er tinke koe.
I walked over to him.	Ik rûn nei him ta.
It can be easy for me too.	It kin my ek maklik wêze.
I heard her too.	Ik hearde har ek.
Nothing seemed to be exactly the right size.	Neat like krekt de goede grutte te wêzen.
But beauty is better.	Mar moai is better.
What they would not.	Wat se net soene.
See if you can tell what something is.	Sjoch as jo kinne fertelle hokker wat is.
I do not know what else can happen to me.	Ik wit net wat der noch mei my barre kin.
Often they talk to me too loudly.	Faak prate se my te hurd.
To be with him.	Om by him te wêzen.
He made it.	Hy makke it.
He was, he is.	Hy wie, hy is.
Never doubt it.	Twifelje der noait oan.
It does look nice though.	It liket wol aardich.
She just came.	Se kaam net.
I told her it would.	Ik fertelde har dat it soe.
What would happen would happen.	Wat der barre soe, soe barre.
He does the same.	Hy docht itselde.
He did not think much of him.	Hy tocht net folle fan him.
And it does not matter what you do.	En it makket neat út wat jo dogge.
We need new ones.	Wy hawwe nije nedich.
I really made it just right.	Ik haw it echt krekt makke.
The more you eat, the more you gain.	Hoe mear jo ite, hoe mear jo winne.
I was pretty good at it.	Ik wie der aardich goed yn.
It was done all the time.	It waard dien de hiele tiid.
It really does.	It docht it echt.
I've seen them.	Ik haw se sjoen.
You do not have to worry about what they might think.	Jo hoege jo gjin soargen te meitsjen oer wat se tinke kinne.
He liked her name too.	Hy mocht har namme ek graach.
What he says may not be true.	Wat er seit kin net wier wêze.
She had been so sure.	Se hie sa wis west.
What he knows, he knows.	Wat er wit, wit er.
I wonder if this will happen to me soon.	Ik freegje my ôf oft dit my gau wurde sil.
There has to be a better way.	Der moat in bettere manier wêze.
I would never eat it.	Ik soe it noait ite.
I love to see him.	Ik hâld fan him te sjen.
You do not want it, of course.	Jo wolle it net, fansels.
But she herself knew nothing of it.	Mar se wist der sels neat fan.
This is about her whole person.	Dit giet oer har hiele persoan.
The boy was gone.	De jonge wie fuort.
I would love to somehow make this my job.	Ik soe graach ien of oare manier meitsje dit myn baan.
Or what it had to do for you.	Of wat it foar dy dwaan moast.
That's so wrong.	Dat is sa ferkeard.
Can't talk for long.	Kin net lang prate.
It was beautiful out there.	It wie der moai út.
We'll be back to that.	Wy komme der op werom.
It did not like itself.	It like himsels net.
That's it.	Dat is it sa.
They work for me.	Se wurkje foar my.
I just have to get through the week.	Ik moat gewoan troch de wike.
It's here now.	It is hjir no.
It may not be enough yet.	It kin noch net genôch wêze.
Hope people like it.	Hoopje dat minsken it leuk fine.
I had such a good time.	Ik hie sa'n goede tiid.
It felt like it was going on forever.	It fielde as gie it foar altyd.
There is no good way.	D'r is gjin goede manier.
The day was beautiful.	De dei wie moai.
He says he would like to see them if he could.	Hy seit dat er se wol sjen soe as er koe.
So that's it.	Sa is dat.
Whether they win today or not.	Oft se hjoed winne of net.
I worry about people.	Ik meitsje my soargen oer minsken.
That it can now.	Dat it no kin.
It's as clear as day.	It is sa dúdlik as de dei.
Clearly, she looked.	Dúdlik, se seach.
This is pretty clear.	Dit is frij dúdlik.
He talks to no one, and is always by himself.	Hy praat mei nimmen, en is altyd by himsels.
You did well, boy.	Jo hawwe it goed dien, jonge.
My whole life has been for you.	Myn hiele libben is foar jo west.
Thirty years earlier, perhaps.	Tritich jier earder, miskien.
It's about me, not her.	It giet oer my, net har.
Well, everyone sees the same thing.	No, elkenien sjocht itselde ding.
My idea actually worked.	Myn idee wurke eins.
Of course, he made it clear.	Fansels hat er him dúdlik makke.
That's the problem.	Dat is it probleem.
Everything was completely ready.	Alles wie hielendal klear.
You have to come with me.	Jo moatte mei my komme.
I'll be back in a few days.	Ik kom oer in pear dagen werom.
I'm just angry.	Ik bin gewoan lilk.
Though it's not so good to see me.	Al is it net sa goed om my te sjen.
They really do.	Dat dogge se echt.
She just could not.	Se koe gewoan net.
This will not work either.	Dit sil ek net wurkje.
He stands there and stands there.	Hy stiet dêr en stiet dêr.
I do not want to do that again.	Dat wol ik ek net wer dwaan.
She's just a child.	Se is mar in bern.
I do not know how to do that.	Ik wit net hoe't ik dat dwaan moat.
This is good enough for me.	Dit is goed genôch foar my.
The couple had no children.	It pear hie gjin bern.
Before it was too late.	Foardat it te let wie.
I'll get it for you.	Ik sil it foar dy krije.
She did not like that dog.	Se mocht net fan dy hûn.
If you have a family.	As jo ​​​​in famylje hawwe.
It was a thing of the water.	It wie in ding fan it wetter.
He had not thought of that.	Hy hie der net oan tocht.
And she knows you can do it.	En se wit dat jo it kinne.
But she can not see.	Mar se kin net sjen.
I can not say for sure yet.	Ik kin it noch net foar wis sizze.
And it almost did.	En it die hast.
It kind of worked.	It soarte fan wurke.
There was another reason.	Der wie in oare reden.
I just want to know where he came from.	Ik wol gewoan witte wêr't er wei kaam.
Someone did this for me a long time ago.	Ien hat dit lang lyn foar my dien.
Think what you want.	Tink wat jo wolle.
They were different.	Se wiene oars.
And he does it.	En hy docht it.
This is a great opportunity.	Dit is in grutte kâns.
I have a very good idea.	Ik haw in hiel goed idee.
I never told you.	Ik haw it dy noait ferteld.
Let the animal out.	Lit it bist út.
It's her job.	It is har wurk.
They had been in the same class.	Se hiene yn deselde klasse west.
It's right through here.	It is hjir krekt troch.
Nothing he does is good enough for her.	Neat wat er docht is goed genôch foar har.
I showed him my picture.	Ik liet him myn foto sjen.
We do not know why, and that does not matter.	Wy witte net wêrom, en dat makket neat út.
It seemed like a good idea.	It like in goed idee.
His mother was reading a book.	Syn mem siet in boek te lêzen.
Do not think too hard.	Tink net te hurd.
This man wants something.	Dizze man wol wat.
She could see.	Se koe sjen.
It is either this or nothing.	It is of dit of neat.
And it's not good to look at me like that.	En it is ek net goed om my sa oan te sjen.
He was now a little more than worried.	Hy wie no wat mear as soargen.
I will not ask you twice.	Ik sil dy net twa kear freegje.
He had heard.	Hy hie heard.
He would become a father.	Hy soe heit wurde.
There has to be a better way.	Der moat in bettere manier wêze.
You're over there.	Jo binne der oer.
They can keep it.	Se kinne it hâlde.
And this is different.	En dit is oars.
He had never started anything without her.	Hy wie noait wat begûn sûnder har.
But they do nothing of the sort.	Mar se dogge neat fan it soarte.
He did not let us go home.	Hy liet ús net nei hûs gean.
I was very much for the first time in my life.	Ik wie hiel foar it earst yn myn libben.
And nothing came of it.	En der kaam neat.
But the father never gave up on him.	Mar de heit joech him noait op.
That's an hour of my life.	Dat is in oere fan myn libben.
They had not told her the truth.	Se hiene har de wierheid net ferteld.
He must be here too.	Hy moat hjir ek wêze.
I'm not really interested.	Ik bin net echt ynteressearre.
You will be glad you did.	Jo sille bliid wêze dat jo dien hawwe.
I want to make that clear.	Ik wol dat dúdlik meitsje.
I did nothing wrong.	Ik haw neat ferkeard dien.
I believe in hope.	Ik leau yn hope.
They certainly started from there.	Se binne der wis fan begûn.
We work for you.	Wy wurkje foar jo.
You're here on time.	Do bist hjir krekt op tiid.
But they do.	Mar se dogge.
Be careful with it.	Wês der foarsichtich mei.
That it should go.	Dat it moat gean.
I was just there.	Ik wie der gewoan.
We need to get there.	Wy moatte der oan komme.
But he kept going.	Mar hy gie troch.
If anything.	As mar wat.
He only hoped it was not to be seen.	Hy hope allinnich dat it net te sjen wie.
I'm scared of myself.	Ik bin bang foar my.
How long ago had it been.	Hoe lang lyn wie it west.
Never was.	Nea wie.
It goes on forever.	It giet foar altyd troch.
There was nothing more to do.	Der wie neat mear te dwaan.
I'm the one who has to leave.	Ik bin dejinge dy't fuort moat.
Try it and see what happens.	Besykje it en sjoch wat der bart.
Never heard of it again.	Nea wer fan heard.
I had one.	Ik hie ien.
Maybe he did.	Miskien hat er it dien.
We did not say much either.	Wy hawwe ek net folle sein.
She would tell him.	Se soe it him fertelle.
I can not stay so late anymore.	Ik kin sa let net mear bliuwe.
But the problem is that you do not do it.	Mar it probleem is dat jo it net dogge.
It did not matter now.	It makke no neat út.
He talks badly about it.	Hy praat der mar min oer.
We would not do that.	Dat soene wy ​​net dwaan.
He will know it.	Hy sil it witte.
He could not.	Hy koe net.
And for him, he was everything.	En foar him wie hy alles.
You're in trouble.	Jo binne yn de problemen.
I'm in the right place.	Ik bin op it goede plak.
Many people are getting sick these days.	In protte minsken wurde dizze dagen siik.
I'm not telling her anything she does not know.	Ik fertel har neat wat se net witte.
This was happening.	Dit wie bart.
I'm having a little trouble.	Ik haw in bytsje problemen.
Someone else had.	Ien oare hie.
He sees the people in those things.	Hy sjocht de minsken yn dy dingen.
It should never have been good.	It hie nea goed wêze moatten.
This song was about him, he thought.	Dit liet gie oer him, tocht er.
That was the best day of my life.	Dat wie de bêste dei fan myn libben.
It is forever.	It is foar altyd.
I was in his house.	Ik wie yn syn hûs.
It's not so late.	It is net sa let.
Water them abundantly and often.	Wetter se folle en faak.
But there was no time.	Mar der wie gjin tiid.
But he wanted to know.	Mar hy woe it witte.
But neither is he.	Mar dat is hy ek net.
I heard him.	Ik hearde him.
I already felt sick.	Ik fielde my al siik.
People would be there.	Minsken soene der wêze.
And then go.	En dan giet.
You can buy them or make them.	Jo kinne se keapje of meitsje se.
Then do something.	Doch dan wat.
They talked to anyone who was interested.	Se prate mei elkenien dy't ynteressearre wie.
That would be good.	Dat soe goed wêze.
Now the question is whether it can keep him.	No is de fraach oft it him hâlde kin.
Her mother would go along with it.	Har mem soe der mei troch gean.
But no one accepted me so much.	Mar nimmen naam my sa folle oan.
But it will not be easy to agree.	Mar it sil net maklik wêze om it iens te wurden.
I saw the things you did.	Ik seach de dingen dy't jo dien hawwe.
This is exactly where you need to be.	Dit is krekt wêr't jo moatte wêze.
He was almost as tall as her.	Hy wie hast like lang as har.
There's not much it can not do.	D'r is net folle dat it net kin dwaan.
So far we have two children.	Oant no hawwe wy twa bern.
And it would hurt them both.	En it soe har beide sear dwaan.
Nor could they.	Dat koene se ek net.
I've seen what's going on.	Ik haw sjoen wat der bart.
But if we do this thing, they will win.	Mar as wy dit ding dogge, sille se winne.
I see no problem with that.	Ik sjoch der gjin probleem mei.
We are so good together.	Wy binne sa goed tegearre.
I work for you.	Ik wurkje foar dy.
I did too.	Ik die ek.
I think we have a problem here.	Ik tink dat wy hjir in probleem hawwe.
We are human beings too.	Wy binne ek minsken.
A young man.	In jonge man.
If only it worked.	As it mar wurket.
We were not there.	Wy wiene der net.
This is an opportunity.	Dit is in kâns.
She can come with me.	Se kin mei my komme.
In your house.	Yn dyn hûs.
And no one will tell her otherwise.	En gjinien sil har oars fertelle.
He's coming back.	Hy komt werom.
Words can be fun.	Wurden kinne leuk wêze.
They are different.	Se binne oars.
You will regret it.	Jo sille der spyt fan hawwe.
We have enough money.	Wy hawwe genôch jild.
On behalf of .	Út namme fan .
How is it with me.	Hoe sit it dêr mei my.
Nothing happened.	Der bart neat.
Could not do it without you.	Koe it net dwaan sûnder dy.
That was really what my husband wanted.	Dat wie echt wat myn man woe.
One sits, one stands.	Ien sit, ien stiet.
What's that?	Wat is dat?
That was his thing.	Dat wie syn ding.
I need you to believe me.	Ik moat dat jo my leauwe.
I let him give the money.	Ik liet him it jild jaan.
Almost up, we're too late.	Hast op, wy binne al te let.
They are people just the same as us.	It binne minsken krekt itselde as wy.
But today is not a good day.	Mar hjoed is gjin goede dei.
She thought she might need help.	Se tocht dat se miskien help krije moast.
Can't wait.	Ik kin net wachtsje.
Look at your book.	Sjoch nei dyn boek.
Maybe more now than ever.	Miskien mear no as ea.
He wanted to come.	Hy woe komme.
You have to do it better than ever.	Jo moatte it better dwaan as ea.
Very good for you.	Hiel goed foar dy.
It felt too fast.	It fielde te gau.
There were people.	Der wiene minsken.
I love to see her so happy.	Ik hâld fan har sa bliid te sjen.
He's just like you and me.	Hy is krekt as jo en ik.
That was just what she had expected.	Dat wie allinnich wat se ferwachte hie.
Make some food for tonight.	Meitsje wat iten foar fannacht.
He should not look at you.	Hy soe net nei dy moatte sjen.
But do not worry.	Mar meitsje jo gjin soargen.
I needed to know more.	Ik moast mear witte.
You ask us.	Jo freegje ús.
Can you believe her husband is actually letting her go ?.	Kinne jo leauwe dat har man har eins lit?.
We do not yet.	Wy noch net.
I feel free here.	Ik fiel my frij hjir.
They had no food.	Se hiene gjin iten.
Not tomorrow or a few months from now.	Net moarn of in pear moanne fan no.
So not now, in the following.	Sa net no, yn de folgjende.
She must be.	Se moat wêze.
I see two problems.	Ik sjoch twa problemen.
You were a good wife to me and to me.	Jo wiene in goede frou foar my en foar my.
There have been almost not enough.	Der binne hast net genôch west.
I had to be with someone.	Ik moast by immen wêze.
Look forward to the following.	Sjoch út nei de folgjende.
We are happy to help you.	Wy helpe jo graach.
Please come back for me.	Kom asjebleaft werom foar my.
You say you can not find it.	Jo sizze dat jo it net fine kinne.
I did not do such a good job to her.	Ik die net sa goed wurk oan har.
She could not think.	Se koe net tinke.
Let him see what he has in store for you.	Lit jo sjen wat hy foar jo hat.
It all looked very nice.	It seach der allegear hiel moai út.
For the money.	Foar it jild.
I would not stay.	Ik soe net bliuwe.
I worry my mother enough.	Ik meitsje myn mem soargen genôch.
I can not look at that.	Dêr kin ik net nei sjen.
We have nothing to do with it.	Dêr hawwe wy neat mei te krijen.
I do not want to see what is there.	Ik wol net sjen wat der is.
We are there to help !.	Wy binne der om te helpen!.
I can not believe it otherwise.	Ik kin it net oars leauwe.
Next time maybe.	Folgjende kear miskien.
That sounds wrong, does it not?	Dat liket ferkeard, is it net?
You do not think about anything else.	Jo tinke net oer wat oars.
None of it is wrong.	Gjin fan it is ferkeard.
Both are doing well.	Beide dogge it goed.
He would have to go back and give.	Hy soe werom moatte en jaan.
I know what you're thinking.	Ik wit wat jo tinke.
I did not do myself.	Ik haw my net dien.
I that was just not easy.	Ek dat wie net maklik.
And he did not even know where they were.	En hy wist net iens wêr't se wiene.
I do not question that.	Dat freegje ik my net ôf.
He does other things first.	Hy docht earst oare dingen.
I do not feel well.	Ik fiel my net goed.
Once upon a time he loved this house.	Eartiids hie er fan dit hûs hâlden.
Or make food.	Of iten meitsje.
That I could see when he was working.	Dat koe ik sjen doe't er wurke.
She looked back.	Se seach werom.
Not so there.	Dêr net sa.
I can find nothing.	Ik kin neat fine.
Who will pay for that?	Wa sil dat betelje?
They opened the door.	Se diene de doar iepen.
More than three.	Mear as trije.
It will be, we need more help.	It sil wêze, wy hawwe mear help nedich.
They can be sick.	Se kinne siik wêze.
What works for you today may not work for you tomorrow.	Wat hjoed foar jo wurket, wurket miskien net moarn.
I was the only person in the car.	Ik wie de ienige persoan yn 'e auto.
We know.	Wy witte.
But it was not his time, it was not his time.	Mar it wie syn tiid net, it wie syn tiid net.
When they come to us, we can talk to them.	As se by ús komme, kinne wy ​​mei har prate.
I do not know, maybe it was just something she could do.	Ik wit it net, miskien wie it gewoan wat dat se dwaan koe.
He still has to get to work.	Hy moat noch oan it wurk.
She will never do anything to you again.	Se sil jo noait wer wat dwaan.
You can see it for yourself.	Jo kinne it sels sjen.
They put the car in.	Se sette de auto yn.
We talked.	Wy hawwe praat.
But he could not.	Mar hy koe net.
You go to it.	Jo geane nei it.
He will make new friends today.	Hy sil hjoed nije freonen meitsje.
All of them.	Elkenien.
I felt bad about it.	Ik fielde my dêr min oer.
It holds you back.	It hâldt dy werom.
I had nothing to do with it.	Ik hie der neat fan oan.
Please? 	Asjebleaft?
I need you.	Ik bin dy nedich.
That's what it's about.	Dat is wêr't it om giet.
Size is not the only problem.	Grutte is net it ienige probleem.
Doing problems again.	Dogge problemen wer.
She said she was not entirely sure.	Se sei dat se der net hielendal wis fan wie.
That's what got me.	Dat is wat my krige.
I would like to know what you think.	Ik soe graach witte wat jo tinke.
The other people were too scared.	De oare minsken wiene te bang.
They should not know it.	Se moatte it net witte.
I had not realized it.	Ik hie it net realisearre.
But that's the kind of thing that happens.	Mar dat is it soarte ding dat bart.
They had no one else.	Se hiene nimmen oars.
He does not want to talk.	Hy wol net prate.
You know nothing.	Jo witte neat.
He was too scared to approach her.	Hy wie te bang om har oan te kommen.
Or, well.	Of, goed.
I need to have a life.	Ik moat in libben hawwe.
What matters is you.	Wat it giet is jo.
This movie has it all.	Dizze film hat alles.
You are not fun.	Jo binne net leuk.
My best friend.	Myn bêste freon.
She then had no idea what she would make of her life.	Se hie dan gjin idee wat se fan har libben meitsje soe.
He says what, she says what.	Hy seit wat, se seit wat.
In my city.	Yn myn stêd.
What you have to believe.	Wat jo moatte leauwe.
You think you would be happy there.	Jo tinke dat jo dêr bliid wêze soene.
I haven't even heard from you in two years.	Ik haw al twa jier net iens fan dy heard.
I really could not be sure what would happen then.	Ik koe echt net wis wêze wat der dan barre soe.
It made me an animal.	It makke my in bist.
They hurt.	Se dogge sear.
Look, she said.	Sjoch, sei se.
But who knows then.	Mar wa wit dan.
But show me.	Mar lit my sjen.
She so needed to not be there.	Se hie sa nedich om der net te wêzen.
Now  .	No .
Maybe it's time we talked to each other.	Miskien wurdt it tiid dat wy mei elkoar prate.
If only they could stay here forever.	As se hjir mar foar altyd bliuwe koene.
I believe this is the problem.	Ik leau dat dit it probleem is.
I really wish this worked.	Ik woe echt dat dit wurke.
I look forward to doing that.	Ik sjoch der nei út om dat te dwaan.
That's what she said.	Dat sei se.
When you are ready, go back to school.	As jo ​​​​klear binne, gean dan werom nei skoalle.
Just the letter.	Krekt de brief.
I know all this.	Ik wit al dizze.
You will not want to agree.	Jo sille net iens wolle.
What happened would never happen again.	Wat der bard wie soe nea wer barre.
We do not ask anyone.	Wy freegje gjinien.
Never expected that to be so hard today.	Nea ferwachte dat hjoed sa hurd soe wêze.
Never seen it.	Nea sjoen it.
She was just jailed.	Se wie krekt finzenis.
Make whatever you want from this.	Meitsje wat jo wolle fan dit.
I've already read that book.	Ik haw dat boek al lêzen.
It hurt all week.	It die de hiele wike sear.
She was never home at this hour.	Se wie nea thús op dit oere.
I had no idea how he knew that.	Ik hie gjin idee hoe't er dat wist.
That's exactly what he was hoping for.	Dat is krekt wêr't er op hope hie.
He was not ready yet.	Hy wie noch net klear.
I want you to have the best of everything.	Ik wol dat jo it bêste fan alles hawwe.
Of course they do.	Fansels dogge se dat.
You do two things.	Jo meitsje twa dingen.
We love that.	Dat hâlde wy wol.
Then you talk to him.	Dan prate jo mei him.
Thus, faith alone is not enough.	Sa is it leauwe allinnich net genôch.
And sooner.	En earder.
That's exactly what we did.	Dat is krekt wat wy dien hawwe.
I had seen this.	Ik hie dit sjoen.
I can not even see what it is.	Ik kin net iens sjen wat it is.
Well, maybe that's true.	No, miskien is dat wier.
Very poorly done.	Hiel min dien.
That was the only time.	Dat wie de ienige kear.
He also had more.	Hy hie ek mear.
I need to know.	Ik moat it witte.
I'm not looking forward to being that person.	Ik sjoch der net nei út om dy persoan te wêzen.
Maybe not for you but for me.	Miskien net foar dy mar foar my.
The man knows what he's doing.	De man wit wat er docht.
I just do not want them around me.	Ik wol se gewoan net om my hinne.
You said it yourself.	Jo hawwe it sels sein.
I'll come back to that.	Ik kom der op werom.
He will never do it again.	Hy sil dit noait wer dwaan.
Maybe if she just told him.	Miskien as se it him mar fertelde.
That would have been better.	Dat hie better west.
I'll look after your wife.	Ik sil nei dyn frou sjen.
We love it though.	Wy hâlde it wol.
And why they do not.	En wêrom dogge se net.
Look at this.	Sjoch nei dit.
She ran out.	Se rûn út.
We must hope.	Wy moatte hoopje.
I may or may not agree.	Ik kin wol of net iens.
How do you do this?	Hoe dogge jo dit?
I was in trouble.	Ik wie yn de problemen.
Something's happening.	Der bart wat.
We know where you live.	Wy witte wêr't jo wenje.
Not for your school.	Net foar jo skoalle.
You no longer need them.	Jo hawwe se net mear nedich.
Not until it was over.	Net oant it oer wie.
The work of the day made him stand out.	It wurk fan 'e dei makke him út.
If you are tired, you should go to bed.	As jo ​​wurch binne, moatte jo op bêd gean.
And so he must.	En sa moat er.
But now he was sure.	Mar no wie er wis.
I was surprised to see her.	Ik wie ferrast har te sjen.
She came out.	Se kaam út.
Please help me to help her.	Help my asjebleaft har te helpen.
Not only that.	Net allinnich dat.
I did find a few though.	Ik fûn wol in pear.
She would be scared, but she could do it.	Se soe bang wêze, mar se koe it dwaan.
I did not get that.	Dat krige ik net.
I have nothing.	Ik ha neat.
Nothing really happened.	Der is eins neat bard.
I do not know when that is.	Ik wit net wannear dat is.
Didn't know to do it all the time.	Wist net om it de hiele tiid te dwaan.
She wants you to just take her.	Se wol dat jo har gewoan nimme.
The father is obtained.	De heit wurdt krigen.
Ask for someone to come.	Freegje om immen te kommen.
He knew something was off, but did not know what it was.	Hy wist dat der wat ôf wie, mar wist net wat it wie.
I was ready to give up.	Ik wie ree om op te jaan.
It was as true as thought.	It wie sa wier as tocht.
This will not do.	Dit sil net dwaan.
But of course you would not.	Mar jo soene fansels net.
About many things.	Oer in protte dingen.
She was glad he had asked.	Se wie bliid dat er frege hie.
I hadn’t had it against my hair yet.	Ik hie it noch net tsjin myn hier.
Maybe another time.	Miskien in oare kear.
We are not going back in there.	Wy geane der net werom yn.
That goes on too.	Dat giet ek troch.
Or maybe they just hadn't gotten to it yet.	Of miskien wiene se der gewoan noch net oan kommen.
No one did.	Gjinien die.
And so it will be with us forever.	En sa sil it foar altyd mei ús wêze.
They met for the first time.	Se moete foar de earste kear.
He did not have to tell her.	Hy hoegde it har net te fertellen.
And her father, was at home.	En har heit, wie thús.
This is my bed.	Dit is myn bêd.
All he wanted all that time was to come back to you.	Alles wat er dy hiele tiid woe wie om werom te kommen nei dy.
His parents seemed nice though.	Syn âlden like wol aardich.
We had been over this before.	Wy hiene dit earder oer west.
To have his money.	Om syn jild te hawwen.
But no one says anything.	Mar nimmen seit wat.
She was a big one, he says.	Se wie in grutte, seit er.
There I am with you.	Dêr bin ik mei dy.
But it has seemed so before.	Mar it hat earder sa like.
Why he did not, is hard to say.	Wêrom't er net die, is dreech te sizzen.
She has.	Se hat.
They have good reason.	Se hawwe goede reden.
They will find it soon enough.	Se sille it gau genôch fine.
But, love a lot to talk about.	Mar, hâldt in protte om te praten.
Things were not real.	Dingen wiene net echt.
When that happens, we're ready.	As dat bart, binne wy ​​klear.
There is no new week.	Der is gjin nije wike.
Earlier this year.	Earder dit jier.
She looked at him.	Se seach him oan.
I had never had any problems with him.	Ik hie noait problemen mei him hân.
We would like to know.	Wy wolle it graach witte.
He comes from in the.	Hy komt fan yn de.
We're almost there.	Wy binne der hast.
From home.	Fan hûs út.
Why would he.	Wêrom soe hy.
I'm still like that.	Ik bin noch altyd sa.
Tell him what you told me!	Fertel him wat jo my sein hawwe!
But it was still not enough.	Mar it wie noch net genôch.
I do not want to see anything.	Ik wol neat sjen.
I want to try something different.	Ik wol wat oars besykje.
Everyone comes to talk.	Elkenien komt te praten.
I'm pretty happy with that.	Ik bin der aardich bliid mei.
You will get exactly what you put into it.	Jo sille der krekt út krije wat jo der yn sette.
He does not know them.	Hy ken se net.
asked the boy.	frege de jonge.
He was still looking over me.	Hy seach noch oer my.
That's what I'll tell you.	Dat sil ik dy sizze.
Always be on time.	Altyd op tiid wêze.
I do not see anything else you can say.	Ik sjoch net oars kinne jo sizze.
I think we should do this together.	Ik tink dat wy dit tegearre moatte dwaan.
He knew it was time and that the day was coming.	Hy wist dat it tiid wie en dat de dei kaam.
He is something else.	Hy is wat oars.
There is one thing.	Der is ien ding.
It was time for me to go too.	It wie foar my ek tiid om te gean.
Neither of us knew what to do about it.	Net ien fan ús wist wat der oan te dwaan.
I just do not know.	Ik wit it gewoan net.
The meeting was held over two days.	De gearkomste waard hâlden oer twa dagen.
But she was needed.	Mar se wie nedich.
She wanted to know how it was with you.	Se woe witte hoe't it mei jo west hat.
If anyone is in trouble, help them.	As immen yn problemen is, help har dan.
She came over to eat.	Se kaam oer it iten.
It was nice to see.	It wie moai om te sjen.
Give and take all.	Allegear jaan en nimme.
Do not tell me.	Fertel my net.
She wanted a real life.	Se woe in echt libben.
Take me in.	Nim my yn.
He hopes for nothing.	Hy hope op neat.
A woman came to him.	In frou kaam by him.
There was no way to tell them.	Der wie gjin manier om se te sizzen.
I left them both in there.	Ik liet se beide der yn.
For me, it was the school of life.	Foar my wie it de skoalle fan it libben.
It's too long.	It is te lang.
The class was tired.	De klasse wie wurch.
I love him so much that even he loves me for everything.	Ik hâld sa fan him, dat sels hy my fan alles hâldt.
And he eats it up.	En hy yt him op.
But nothing like what's happening now.	Mar neat as wat der no bart.
That's what she told me.	Dat fertelde se my.
It could not be good.	It koe net goed wêze.
That girl is beautiful.	Dat famke is moai.
I had thought of that.	Ik hie der oan tocht.
Everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong.	Alles wat ferkeard gean koe, is ferkeard gien.
That was my question.	Dat wie myn fraach.
It does not matter to her.	It makket har neat út.
She gave away.	Se joech wei.
Nice work if you can get it.	Moai wurk as jo it krije kinne.
And it's good.	En it is goed.
How did he do it?	Hoe hat er it dien?
There was something he hoped to see happen.	Der wie wat er hope te sjen barre.
I did not have to say that.	Dat hoegde ik net te sizzen.
She seemed surprised.	Se like ferrast.
Go to bed early tonight.	Gean fannacht betiid op bêd.
Now that.	No dat.
Not much, maybe.	Net folle, miskien.
We will do nothing of the sort.	Wy sille neat fan dat soarte dwaan.
It's true to.	It is wier oan.
There would be no time to get out.	Der soe gjin tiid wêze om út te kommen.
As if they had been.	As hiene se west.
You can not come.	Jo kinne net komme.
But this was not a school.	Mar dit wie gjin skoalle.
She could not return.	Se koe net werom.
She never wanted anything other than her food.	Se woe noait oars as har iten.
The boy was mine.	De jonge wie fan my.
He has worked so hard over the last year.	Hy hat it lêste jier sa hurd wurke.
The only way is if you do it in your home.	De ienige manier is as jo it yn jo hûs dogge.
But not much else before they get here.	Mar net folle oars foardat se hjir komme.
You know what will happen.	Jo witte wat der barre sil.
Your children win.	Jo bern winne.
I had this problem once.	Ik hie dit probleem ien kear.
I'm determined it will not happen to me.	Ik bin besletten dat it my net sil barre.
I want to help with your book.	Ik wol helpe mei dyn boek.
He's a good friend.	Hy is in goede freon.
And he did that.	En hy die dat.
You can almost see it.	Jo kinne it hast sjen.
That's all.	Dat is alles.
I always think about it of course.	Ik tink der altyd oer nei fansels.
Maybe she was away from the police.	Miskien wie se fan 'e plysje wei.
Nothing else could be heard.	Der koe neat oars heard wurde.
This is difficult for so many people.	Dit is dreech foar safolle minsken.
He seemed surprised and happy to see me.	Hy like ferrast en bliid om my te sjen.
That you do not have to make it.	Dat jo hoege it net te meitsjen.
And a lot of people did.	En in protte minsken diene.
These are very different.	Dizze binne hiel oars.
Well, to tell you what happened.	No, om jo te fertellen wat der bard is.
That's not me.	Dat bin ik net.
Here they do not.	Hjir dogge se net.
This actually happens a lot.	Dit bart eins in protte.
What can you see there? 	Wat kinne jo dêr sjen?
Is to the problem.	Is oan it probleem.
And now they are gone again.	En no binne se wer fuort.
The time had been good for his husband.	De tiid hie syn man goed west.
So it is with this one.	Sa is it mei dizze.
That is not to say to me.	Dat is net oan my te sizzen.
But look he did.	Mar sjoch hy die.
Maybe one day this weekend.	Miskien ien dei dit wykein.
I have nothing to do.	Ik haw neat te dwaan.
All they really need is the boy.	Alles wat se echt nedich binne is de jonge.
It never came off that.	Dêr is noait fan ôf kommen.
It was pretty clear.	It wie frij dúdlik.
I said sure.	Ik sei wis.
You can say they are yours.	Jo kinne sizze dat se fan jo binne.
It was more how she said it.	It wie mear hoe't se it sei.
The man who came into our room is leaving.	De man dy't yn ús keamer kaam, gean fuort.
Let him do what he wants.	Lit him dwaan wat er wol.
You just have to let the guy talk.	Jo moatte gewoan de keardel prate litte.
I do not really believe it will happen.	Ik leau net echt dat it sil barre.
Met the boy twice.	Moete de jonge twa kear.
He was not the one who put me there.	Hy wie net dejinge dy't my dêr sette.
Give the money back.	Jou it jild werom.
When and where would they eat.	Wannear en wêr soene se ite.
And nothing yet.	En noch neat.
I'm afraid it did not.	Ik bin bang dat it net hat.
That's up to you.	Dat is oan dy.
Doing his job.	Doet syn wurk.
Many, many things.	In protte, in protte dingen.
Just one of many.	Krekt ien fan in protte.
We do not get into that.	Dêr komme wy net yn.
And her plan is not to do it today.	En har plan is it hjoed net te dwaan.
We no longer need it.	Wy hawwe it net mear nedich.
He made some money last year.	Hy makke ferline jier wat jild.
Maybe that's good.	Miskien is dat goed.
No one rode his bike.	Gjin riden syn fyts.
You will not be able to come to him.	Jo sille net by him komme kinne.
I could see very clearly.	Ik koe hiel dúdlik sjen.
So it will happen to you too.	Sa sil it foar dy ek barre.
And it works.	En it wurket.
Everyone got it really, really good.	Elkenien krige it echt, echt goed.
holds.	hâldt.
Then we need to get some food.	Dan moatte wy wat iten krije.
It was always there.	It wie der altyd.
Come in and talk to him.	Kom yn en praat mei him.
I do not know why this is happening.	Ik wit net wêrom dit bart.
Whatever it is.	Wat der ek is.
This would do two things.	Dit soe twa dingen dwaan.
Well, this leaves me out.	No, dit lit my út.
It's just fun to say.	It is gewoan leuk om te sizzen.
If it can, even today.	As it kin, hjoed sels.
I want to be just like her.	Ik wol krekt as har wêze.
I'll wait and see what happens.	Ik sil wachtsje en sjen wat der bart.
But nothing did.	Mar neat die.
Come on.	Kom op.
He had enough hope for two.	Hy hie hope genôch foar twa.
He had a problem.	Hy hie in probleem.
I thought about it myself.	Ik tocht der sels oan.
There they lived.	Dêr wenne se.
There could be no better day for that.	Der koe gjin bettere dei foar wêze.
Let me say this.	Lit my dit mar sizze.
Make a plan.	In plan meitsje.
And it probably does not.	En it docht wierskynlik net.
We should try such a thing.	Wy moatte sa'n ding besykje.
And that's what it's about.	En dêr giet it om.
She did everything she could for the child.	Se die alles wat se koe foar it bern.
They agree on three things.	Se binne it oer trije dingen iens.
He does nothing.	Hy docht neat.
Everyone is clear.	Elkenien is dúdlik.
I did not expect that.	Dat hie ik net ferwachte.
You must try.	Jo moatte besykje.
I am interested in two things.	Ik bin ynteressearre yn twa dingen.
So little time to do it.	Sa'n bytsje tiid om it te dwaan.
Not everyone thinks this is a good idea.	Net elkenien tinkt dat dit in goed idee is.
I do not let anyone hurt you.	Ik lit gjinien dy sear dwaan.
Your kind always does.	Jo soarte docht altyd.
It is not.	It is net.
I wish they would not.	Ik winskje dat se net soene.
I'm not convinced of that.	Ik bin der neat fan oertsjûge.
This went on well for a year.	Dit gie goed in jier troch.
From the same day.	Fan deselde dei.
Stayed there of course.	Bleau dêr fansels fuort.
We agree that this is likely.	Wy binne it iens dat dit wierskynlik is.
It does matter what the reason is.	It makket út wat de reden is.
I was just a friend of your mother.	Ik wie mar in freon fan dyn mem.
I want to like this.	Ik wol dit leuk fine.
Only one way to find out.	Allinnich ien manier om út te finen.
They put the person to talk.	Se sette de persoan oan it praten.
Hadn't even been out long.	Hie net iens lang út west.
Why not?	Wêrom net?
This is what we did.	Dit hawwe wy dien.
Then we will eat and we are ready for tomorrow.	Dan sille wy ite en binne wy ​​klear foar moarn.
If it is real.	As it echt is.
So we keep one around.	Sa hâlde wy der ien om hinne.
Now life must be like that.	No moat it libben sa wêze.
Sure, she had been scared for her life.	Wis, se hie bang west foar har libben.
There is more to it than that.	Der is noch mear as dat.
If she says nothing, you better find something to do.	As se neat seit, kinne jo better noch wat te dwaan fine.
I was surprised to see you here.	Ik wie ferrast om dy hjir te sjen.
There should be no school coming today.	Der soe hjoed gjin skoalle komme moatte.
I'm sorry, he said.	It spyt my, sei er.
He said he did not know why he had done it.	Hy sei dat er net wist wêrom er it dien hie.
Think carefully about what you will do.	Tink goed oer wat jo sille dwaan.
Whatever he did, she was determined to stay with him.	Wat er ek dien hat, se is besletten om by him te bliuwen.
And it's not easy.	En it is net maklik.
He wants to be best friends forever.	Hy wol foar altyd bêste freonen wêze.
I knew where he was going.	Ik wist wêr't er hinne soe.
It seemed so hard to open his hand.	It like sa dreech om syn hân iepen te dwaan.
Everyone knew what had been done.	Allegear wisten wat dien wie.
He still thought hard.	Hy tocht noch hurd.
I look into her past.	Ik sjoch yn har ferline.
But it can not.	Mar it kin net.
I do not know what to do with her now.	Ik wit net wat ik no mei har dwaan moat.
These are the things that you do not think about that you get.	It binne de dingen wêr't jo net oer tinke dy't jo krije.
He says he will probably never see me again.	Hy seit dat hy my wierskynlik noait wer sil sjen.
Of course, they could stay a few more days.	Fansels koene se noch in pear dagen bliuwe.
If it's there.	As it der is.
With another teacher.	Mei in oare learaar.
We hope you enjoy it.	Wy hoopje dat jo it besykje.
Until it was.	Oant it wie.
Nobody ever told me.	Nimmen hat my oait ferteld.
So it goes on and on.	Sa giet it mar troch en troch.
We could not get him out of there.	Wy koene him der net út krije.
He looked up at the house.	Hy seach op nei it hûs.
They like to say this.	Se graach sizze dit.
We want them to like us.	Wy wolle dat se ús leuk fine.
He made clear what was expected of me.	Hy makke dúdlik wat fan my ferwachte waard.
Kin ek.	Kin ek.
Now we just have to hope for the best.	No moatte wy mar op it bêste hoopje.
I have no friends.	Ik haw gjin freonen.
I'm sitting here.	Ik sit hjir.
He should be happy.	Hy soe bliid wêze moatte.
This will be a problem.	Dit sil in probleem wêze.
Neither worked for me.	Gjin fan beide wurke foar my.
I'm the one you should be with.	Ik bin dejinge dy't jo moatte wêze mei.
They are careful.	Se binne foarsichtich.
I'm so much better now.	Ik bin no safolle better.
It's what he does.	It is wat hy docht.
Class do nothing.	Klasse neat dwaan.
Just keep going.	Gean der mar troch.
I had no idea what had happened.	Ik hie gjin idee wat der bard wie.
You know about it, even if you do not think so.	Jo witte der wol fan, ek al tinke jo dat net.
And what is it for one.	En wat is it foar ien.
Same as last week.	Itselde as ferline wike.
However, he is all of you.	Hoe dan ek, hy is allegear fan jo.
No one needs such money.	Gjinien hat sa'n jild nedich.
She did not know what to say.	Se wist net wat se sizze moast.
You're my problem.	Do bist myn probleem.
Look, they say.	Sjoch, sizze se.
We know that.	Dat witte wy wol.
It will be here.	It sil hjir wêze.
He asked himself about family.	Hy frege him ôf oer famylje.
Why would you think anything else.	Wêrom soene jo wat oars tinke.
Lots of money.	In protte jild.
There it was.	Dêr wie it.
The questions still remain.	De fragen bliuwe noch.
She just wanted food.	Se woe gewoan iten.
I can not leave her like that.	Ik kin har net sa litte.
Get help where you can find it.	Nim help wêr't jo it fine kinne.
In those days, life was hard.	Yn dy dagen wie it libben hurd.
But it was not.	Mar it wie net.
I would say we are ready by.	Ik soe sizze dat wy klear binne troch .
I could really hurt her.	Ik koe har echt sear dwaan.
Not much more to say.	Net folle mear te sizzen.
That had never happened before.	Dat wie noch noait earder bard.
So that was it.	Sa wie it alles.
That's pretty much what happened.	Dat is moai wat der bard.
I looked out.	Ik seach der út.
But it's not that pretty.	Mar it is net sa moai.
You have to take care of them and see them.	Jo moatte foar har soargje en har sjen.
Someone wants to hurt you.	Immen wol dy min meitsje.
He never got the chance.	Hy krige nea de kâns.
He was thirty.	Hy wie tritich.
The question, of course, is when.	De fraach is fansels wannear.
You have to do something.	Jo moatte wat dwaan.
Now you will be free.	No sille jo frij wêze.
I want to come next time.	Ik wol de folgjende kear komme.
Do this and you will be free.	Doch dit en jo sille frij wêze.
He could not believe what she was saying, he said.	Hy koe net leauwe wat se sei, sei er.
It seems certain that it can really be.	It liket der wis fan dat it echt kin wêze.
She told us.	Se fertelde ús.
No one found her.	Nimmen fûn har.
It's almost everyone.	It is hast elkenien.
But it's not that different than you might think.	Mar it is net sa oars as jo miskien tinke.
They need to know what's going on.	Se moatte witte wat der bart.
We knew it would not be easy.	Wy wisten dat it net maklik wurde soe.
It did not come easily.	It kaam net maklik.
The bad and the good.	De minne en de goede.
You need to be able to see through it.	Jo moatte der troch sjen kinne.
You need to know better than that.	Jo moatte better witte as dat.
The following year there were none.	It folgjende jier wiene der gjinien.
The girl with the house not out either.	It famke mei it hûs ek net út.
And now it was here.	En no wie it hjir.
So they agree.	Sa binne se it iens.
Much more could be done.	Der koe folle mear dien wurde.
I felt so good.	Ik fielde my sa goed.
He felt like a child.	Hy fielde him as in bern.
I'm not sure how much it makes more.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoefolle it mear makket.
No one else went there.	Nimmen oars gie dêr.
Which, of course, happened.	Wat, fansels, barde.
And we have work to do.	En wy hawwe wurk te dwaan.
I live.	Ik wenje.
And not one, many.	En net ien, in protte.
She does everything and anything you ask of her.	Se docht alles en alles wat jo fan har freegje.
This is the problem.	Dit is it probleem.
I should have known you were thinking that.	Ik hie witte moatten dat jo dat tinke soene.
He went to bed tired and he woke up tired.	Hy gie wurch op bêd en hy waard wekker wurch.
Nor was there.	Ek wie der net.
Those are good things.	Dat binne goede dingen.
Maybe they could help.	Miskien koene se helpe.
I can not wait to see everything.	Ik kin net wachtsje om alles te sjen.
Love the other.	Hâld fan de oare.
Your family needs a lot of help right now.	Jo famylje hat no in protte help nedich.
There could be so many things going wrong.	Der koene safolle dingen ferkeard gean.
She seemed like a good person.	Se like in goed persoan.
I was in a bad way.	Ik wie yn in minne manier.
Believe me, twice is more than enough as it is.	Leau my, twa kear is mear dan genôch as it is.
They will look at me.	Se sille nei my sjen.
She told her that was enough.	Se fertelde har dat genôch genôch wie.
We need say no more.	Mear hoege wy net te sizzen.
One of a kind.	Ien fan dat soarte.
It may be his favorite thing, ever.	It kin syn favorite ding wêze, ea.
Very nice of him.	Hiel aardich fan him.
He does not have much money.	Hy hat net folle jild.
She now knew how much she loved him.	Se wist no hoefolle se fan him hâlde.
If you need more time, take it.	As jo ​​​​mear tiid nedich binne, nim it dan.
I had to work.	Ik moast wurkje.
They do not even know you're here.	Se witte net iens dat jo hjir binne.
There was the place too.	Dêr wie it plak ek.
I show him my school.	Ik lit him myn skoalle sjen.
I'm trying to find another job.	Ik besykje in oare baan te finen.
I work for good people.	Ik wurkje foar goede minsken.
That is not wrong.	Dat is net ferkeard.
It's really nice.	It is echt moai.
But it goes on.	Mar it giet troch.
He has been very good to me.	Hy hat my tige goed west.
And he knew it was true.	En hy wist dat it wier wie.
Now he will say that of course.	No sil er dat fansels sizze.
Please take what you need.	Nim asjebleaft wat jo nedich binne.
She does not regret it.	It spyt har net.
Other days, life seems a bit much.	Oare dagen liket it libben in bytsje folle.
I will not go through that again.	Dêr sit ik net wer troch.
She wanted her to do it.	Se woe dat se it die.
Feel it, feel what you are doing.	Fiel it, fiel wat jo dogge.
To say what he has to say.	Om te sizzen wat er te sizzen hat.
I'm ready for it, he said.	Ik bin der klear foar, sei er.
Agree with it.	It iens mei it.
To read a book we probably need a few days.	Om in boek te lêzen hawwe wy wierskynlik in pear dagen nedich.
She was just.	Se wie gewoan.
I hope you can.	Ik hoopje dat jo it kinne.
Why this happens.	Wêrom bart dit.
Not talking to her, exactly.	Net mei har prate, krekt.
I think he was the guy everyone looked up to.	Ik tink dat hy wie de keardel wa't elkenien seach op.
Everything was fine.	Alles wie goed.
But, he also thought there was nothing to life.	Mar, hy tocht ek dat der neat wie nei it libben.
So she could go.	Sa koe se gean.
All the children were there.	Alle bern wiene der.
It was not the life you expected.	It wie net it libben dat jo ferwachte.
If you ever get the chance to do that, you should.	As jo ​​​​oait de kâns krije om dat te dwaan, moatte jo.
He was received.	Hy waard krigen.
Maybe that happened here.	Miskien is dat hjir bard.
We have been here before.	Wy hawwe hjir earder west.
The bus was late again.	De bus wie wer te let.
Neither does it.	Dat ek net.
Come on.	Kom no.
I was only out there for three or so hours.	Ik wie der mar trije of wat oeren út.
Maybe it will not be as difficult as they think.	Miskien sil it net sa dreech wurde as se tinke.
I think you like it.	Ik tink dat jo it leuk fine.
It was with great regret that he died.	It wie mei grutte spyt dat er stoar.
Not too bad, really.	Net te min, echt.
They say the child would be a boy.	Se sizze dat it bern in jonge wêze soe.
I try hard.	Ik besykje hurd.
He is not well today.	Hy is hjoed net goed.
She knows all about it.	Se wit der alles fan.
I would not try to make anything.	Ik soe net besykje wat te meitsjen.
I have a picture of him here.	Ik haw hjir in foto fan him.
What time is it?	Hoe let is it?
Well, maybe and maybe not.	No, miskien wol en miskien net.
How was it not.	Hoe wie it net.
I hope they become his friends.	Ik hoopje dat se syn freonen wurde.
They do not believe it will help anyone but them.	Se leauwe net dat it immen oars sil helpe as har.
But clearly over time, he has.	Mar dúdlik oer de tiid, hy hat.
For once, it didn’t seem like much.	Foar ien kear like it net folle út.
Arrive earlier for dinner.	Kom earder foar it iten.
And it can not be otherwise for you.	En it kin net oars foar jo.
I totally agree with you.	Ik bin it hielendal mei dy iens.
To be with him.	Om by him te wêzen.
Maybe he took it too well.	Miskien naam er it te goed.
He does not have to say bad words.	Hy hoecht gjin minne wurden te sizzen.
I thought maybe you could help.	Ik tocht dat jo miskien helpe kinne.
She was up in the morning.	Se wie op 'e moarn.
Not this !.	Net dizze!.
I think this may be the problem.	Ik tink dat dit it probleem kin wêze.
Now the problem.	No it probleem.
Many say it is the best.	In protte sizze dat it de bêste is.
He has done this before.	Hy hat dit earder dien.
I see him as a man and as a friend.	Ik sjoch him as in man en as in freon.
I said that.	Ik sei dat.
There was only one thing that was certain.	Der wie mar ien ding dat wis wie.
I'm on my way to get it.	Ik bin op 'e wei om it te krijen.
Now you move on.	No geane jo troch.
That would be just right.	Dat soe krekt wêze.
Wait, you say.	Wachtsje, sizze jo.
He should have one.	Hy soe ien hawwe moatte.
I could not even believe it.	Ik koe it net iens leauwe.
I hope he sees everything.	Ik hoopje dat hy alles sjocht.
Your help came just when we needed it.	Jo help kaam krekt doe't wy it nedich wiene.
Such is life.	Sa is it libben.
No job needed.	Gjin baan nedich.
We'll look into it.	Wy sille der nei sjen.
Just back home.	Krekt werom thús.
I would get to that.	Ik soe der oan komme.
When he felt he was home, he did not show it.	As er fielde dat er thús wie, liet er it net sjen.
It will be good for no one tomorrow.	It sil moarn goed wêze foar nimmen.
The car is really nice.	De auto is echt leuk.
If you have that, you have a lot.	As jo ​​dat hawwe, hawwe jo in protte.
I talk to the other people, but a little.	Ik praat mei de oare minsken, mar in bytsje.
We would find you.	Wy soene dy fine.
Can anyone help me?	Kin immen my helpe?
She had met him before.	Se hie him earder moete.
Everyone wants to help him.	Elkenien wol him helpe.
I've never been to one of them before.	Ik haw noch noait op ien fan har west.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe te dwaan it.
She liked it at first.	Se mocht it earst graach.
Of course it would.	Fansels soe it.
I will not be visiting this week.	Ik sil dizze wike net besykje.
It's a bit.	It is in bytsje.
Never in no trouble.	Nea yn gjin problemen.
Go to your room now.	Gean no nei dyn keamer.
He always likes to play.	Hy is altyd graach spylje.
Other people have done it in the past.	Oare minsken hawwe it yn it ferline dien.
If you love me, you would love to do that.	As jo ​​fan my hâlde, soene jo dat dwaan wolle.
I hope we can play a lot.	Ik hoopje dat wy in protte spylje kinne.
But it worked for me.	Mar it wurke foar my.
It went.	It gie.
It's a very good thing.	It is in hiel goed ding.
Of course, we would never have been.	Fansels soene wy ​​noait west hawwe.
And it will not take much of your time.	En it sil net folle fan jo tiid nimme.
Everyone was happy.	Elkenien wie bliid.
Now they have it.	No hawwe se it.
It will come when the time comes.	It sil komme as de tiid komt.
I make her one, she makes me one.	Ik meitsje har ien, se makket my ien.
I think another person said it best.	Ik tink dat in oare persoan sei it bêste.
Will it hurt him?	Sil it him sear dwaan?
You just have to know how to tell it what to do.	Jo moatte gewoan witte hoe't jo it fertelle wat jo moatte dwaan.
There was plenty of time to be together.	Der wie genôch tiid om tegearre te wêzen.
That's the other.	Dat is de oare.
All out in the open.	Allegear út yn 'e iepen.
I'm not quite sure how you do it.	Ik bin der net hielendal wis fan hoe't jo it dogge.
That has yet to happen.	Dat moat noch barre.
Do not believe that.	Leau dat net.
I'm not sure about you.	Ik bin der net wis fan oer dy.
He the he he the.	Hy die wat hy die.
He just bought a new car.	Hy hat krekt in nije auto kocht.
And he did not know it.	En hy wist it net.
But that's all in the past.	Mar dat is alles yn it ferline.
Here they come.	Hjir komme se.
I sit in here and there.	Ik sit der hjir en dêr yn.
So nice to buy me this.	Sa aardich om my dit te keapjen.
It was not a question.	It wie gjin fraach.
Tell her you did what she said.	Fertel har dat jo dien hawwe wat se seine.
He went to work there yesterday.	Hy gie der juster oan it wurk.
She had no idea where they were going.	Se hie gjin idee wêr't se hinne soene.
No one should.	Net ien moat.
They will talk and hope it happens.	Se sille prate en hoopje dat it bart.
Everyone knew him.	Elkenien koe him.
You are both my friends.	Jo binne myn beide freonen.
I know this is the truth.	Ik wit dat dit de wierheid is.
That's what you find out.	Dat fine jo út.
I have a better plan.	Ik haw in better plan.
And now he is gone forever.	En no is hy foar altyd fuort.
He had enough.	Hy hie genôch.
We've seen this before.	Wy hawwe dit earder sjoen.
I had seen it often enough and knew it well.	Ik hie it faak genôch sjoen en wist it goed.
You can not buy this life.	Jo kinne dit libben net keapje.
I probably never will.	Ik sil wierskynlik nea.
I wanted to go home.	Ik woe nei hûs ta.
He was not needed here.	Hy wie hjir net nedich.
He could not wait to see her.	Hy koe net wachtsje om har te sjen.
It turned out pretty well.	It kaam aardich goed út.
No words to say it.	Gjin wurden om it te sizzen.
But more can be done.	Mar der kin mear dien wurde.
Well, whatever it is.	No, wat it ek is.
Take him away.	Nim him fuort.
Now there you go.	No dêr geane jo.
Here we have the problem.	Hjir hawwe wy it probleem.
They are the mother of them all.	Se binne de mem fan har allegear.
You will be a mother to his children.	Jo sille mem wêze foar syn bern.
I do not want that I am.	Ik wol net dat dat ik bin.
It's you and you know it.	It binne jo en jo witte it.
I see no hope.	Ik sjoch gjin hope.
If you were him, what would you do?	As jo ​​​​him wiene, wat soene jo dwaan?
They are not for me.	Se binne net foar my.
My father saw them too.	Myn heit seach se ek.
That's me two.	Dat binne my twa.
It's your friend.	It is dyn freon.
Even though he thought it, he never showed it.	Ek al tocht er it, hy liet it nea sjen.
Please go without me.	Gean asjebleaft sûnder my.
I'm not the police.	Ik bin net de plysje.
Then we'll see what we can do.	Dan sille wy sjen wat wy dwaan kinne.
He asked her why.	Hy frege har wêrom.
I know it very clearly.	Ik wit it hiel dúdlik.
But eventually gave way.	Mar lang om let joech wei.
She was happy when everyone was ready.	Se wie bliid doe't elkenien klear wie.
You must be free.	Jo moatte frij wêze.
The big man sat next to him.	De grutte man siet by him.
She has lived in this house for thirty years.	Se hat tritich jier yn dit hûs wenne.
You only have to do it once.	Jo moatte it mar ien kear dwaan.
I knew he did some of these things.	Ik wist dat hy in pear fan dizze dingen die.
He could do it.	Hy koe dit dwaan.
That was what was in her.	Dat wie wat yn har siet.
You know who we are, now.	Jo witte wa't wy binne, no.
Come on, you can do it.	Kom, jo ​​kinne it dwaan.
I'm here.	Ik bin hjir.
I'm your father.	Ik bin dyn heit.
And what will be is just the new what is.	En wat sil wêze wurdt gewoan it nije wat is.
I'm almost sick.	Ik bin hast siik.
And it was almost time for one.	En it wie hast tiid foar ien.
It's their money.	It is har jild.
Not as a thing in itself.	Net as in ding op himsels.
She wanted to see her husband again.	Se woe har man wer sjen.
If she had him back.	As se him werom hawwe soe.
And he wanted to do it right.	En hy woe it goed dwaan.
It will be soon.	It sil gau.
How little did they know.	Hoe min wisten se.
Neither does anyone else.	Ek gjinien oars.
She did not want to be seen.	Se woe net sjoen wurde.
I can see it's gone.	Ik kin sjen dat it fuort is.
I almost never talk about him.	Ik praat hast noait oer him.
I could see he was surprised and happy.	Ik koe sjen dat hy ferrast en bliid wie.
Ask for him.	Om him freegje.
We kind of agree.	Wy binne it sa'n bytsje iens.
Let's have enough of it.	Litte wy der genôch fan hawwe.
And, of course, it can not be more than a year old.	En, fansels, it kin net mear as in jier âld.
Far too early to be without his mother.	Folle te betiid om sûnder syn mem te wêzen.
You've seen her house.	Jo hawwe har hûs sjoen.
Someone wants to make money out of you, my friend.	Immen wol jild út dy meitsje, myn freon.
And then we.	En dan wy.
When he was with her, she was scared.	Doe't er by har wie, wie se bang.
It's not just that.	It is net allinnich dat.
Let her do this.	Lit har dit dwaan.
He felt better now.	Hy fielde him no better.
This is already old.	Dit is al âld.
I can not say that we will never do it.	Ik kin net sizze dat wy it noait sille dwaan.
He's just a guy.	Hy is gewoan in keardel.
I knew it was not a good idea to watch the movie.	Ik wist dat it gjin goed idee wie om de film te sjen.
Look at what he did to you.	Sjoch nei wat er mei dy dien hat.
So he hit it off.	Sa rekke er mei.
He came up with a plan.	Hy kaam mei in plan.
That this will be fun.	Dat dit sil leuk wurde.
I came up with something to go with an idea she had.	Ik kaam mei wat te gean mei in idee dat se hie.
This happened once.	Dit barde ien kear.
My father twice.	Myn heit twa kear.
She knew she was wrong.	Se wist dat se ferkeard wie.
They can be beautiful.	Se kinne moai wêze.
What is it.	Wat is it.
At more or less the same time.	Op min of mear deselde tiid.
I feel so old.	Ik fiel my sa âld.
Ask me nothing.	Freegje my neat.
I can tell you that too.	Ik kin it dy ek wol sizze.
She was not, once.	Se wie net, ien kear.
Now look around you.	Sjoch no om dy.
They want you or they do not want you.	Se wolle jo of se wolle net.
I can hope !.	Ik kin hoopje!.
It's nice, actually.	It is aardich, eins.
We did not really know about that.	Dêr wisten wy eins net fan.
Do not worry about time.	Sit gjin soargen oer de tiid.
Please.	Asjebleaft.
Ask her to stay for dinner.	Freegje har om te bliuwen foar it iten.
A few years old.	In pear jier âld.
Do not ask me.	Freegje my net.
She worked hard.	Se wurke hurd.
They can also be bad.	Se kinne ek min wêze.
You can just tell how she sits there.	Jo kinne gewoan fertelle hoe't se dêr sit.
I will come.	Ik sil komme.
Not that it matters.	Net dat it der ta docht.
They are nothing.	Se binne neat.
My work is not difficult.	Myn wurk is net dreech.
I'll tell you.	Ik sil it dy fertelle.
But maybe they have.	Mar miskien hawwe se.
We had one.	Wy hiene ien.
Things that matter.	Dingen dy't der ta dogge.
I'm not good at that kind of thing.	Ik bin net goed yn dat soarte dingen.
The man is looking at you.	De man sjocht nei dy.
There are many other things as well.	Der is ek in protte oare dingen.
Or tonight, or just then.	Of fannacht, of krekt dan.
They are long.	Se binne lang.
They make that thing and it looks good.	Se meitsje dat ding en it sjocht der goed út.
Also works very nicely.	Wurket ek hiel moai.
Well, but he did not.	No, mar hy hie it net.
This is just getting better and better.	Dit wurdt gewoan better en better.
And there we are well on our way.	En dêr binne wy ​​goed op wei.
It's going well for me and my family.	It giet goed foar my en myn famylje.
He gave it up.	Hy joech it ôf.
People live here.	Minsken wenje hjir.
We must take this opportunity.	Wy moatte dizze kâns nimme.
Must have read it.	Moast it lêzen hawwe.
He wanted to say more.	Hy woe mear sizze.
I came to help her, and so she did.	Ik kaam har te helpen, en sa die.
He had never seen her so badly.	Hy hie har noch noait sa min sjoen.
You are our last hope.	Jo binne ús lêste hope.
I had had enough.	Ik hie genôch hân.
Let her find her back herself.	Lit har har werom sels fine.
Maybe he was real.	Miskien wie er echt.
But now there is a problem.	Mar no is der in probleem.
By him.	Troch him.
Not even we will know what happened to you.	Net iens wy sille witte wat der bard mei dy.
You should never go back here.	Jo moatte nea werom hjir.
And now we both have so much more.	En no hawwe wy beide safolle mear.
But that does not have to be the case.	Mar dat hoecht net sa te wêzen.
She had not been home one day.	Se hie net ien dei thús west.
He says to come tomorrow.	Hy seit moarn te kommen.
But that does not make it good.	Mar dat makket it net goed.
Maybe even more.	Miskien noch mear.
Well, we'm almost done.	No, wy binne hast klear.
Tomorrow he could hope again.	Moarn koe er wer hoopje.
She would like them to believe this.	Se soe graach wolle dat se dit leauwe.
Who was really good.	Wie echt goed.
He had also visited him in prison.	Hy hie him ek yn de finzenis besocht.
But do not worry about it.	Mar meitsje jo der gjin soargen oer.
Those words were so true.	Dy wurden wiene sa wier.
For the morning.	Foar de moarn.
Who knows where he came from?	Wa wit wêr't er wei kaam?
But we were.	Mar wy wiene.
I needed her help.	Ik hie har help nedich.
My life was not mine.	Myn libben wie net fan my.
I am a person of faith.	Ik bin in persoan fan leauwe.
Did the children get food?	Hawwe de bern iten krigen?
But not too long after the first.	Mar net te lang nei de earste.
Maybe the only good one.	Miskien de ienige goede.
Wake up for tomorrow.	Wekker foar moarn.
I can see it there.	Ik kin it dêr sjen.
I can not completely agree with that.	Dêr kin ik it net hielendal mei iens wêze.
Otherwise we'll see what happens !.	Oars dan dat wy sille sjen wat der bart!.
It does matter.	It docht der ta.
Time does that.	De tiid docht dat.
I want to know more about the place.	Ik wol mear witte oer it plak.
Try to get away.	Besykje fuort te kommen.
I do not know much about that time.	Ik wit net folle oer dy tiid.
That we were not.	Dat wiene wy ​​net.
For the things you want.	Foar de dingen dy't jo wolle.
We like to work on the weekends.	Wy wurkje graach yn it wykein.
We would have a lot of that.	Dêr soene wy ​​in protte fan hawwe.
That work they do well.	Dat wurk dogge se goed.
It seems to us, one said.	It liket ús, sei ien.
But this time he would have to.	Mar dizze kear soe hy moatte.
He seemed nice enough.	Hy like aardich genôch.
I'll do this thing.	Ik sil dit ding dwaan.
There were still three problems.	Der wiene noch trije problemen.
The day did not start well.	De dei begûn net goed.
They will go through everything.	Se sille troch alles.
It's a real party.	It is in wier feest.
Been here before.	Hjir earder west.
For people, for me.	Foar minsken, foar my.
We should not have told him.	Wy hiene it him net fertelle moatten.
She was waiting for me to tell her more.	Se wachte op my om har mear te fertellen.
If it.	As dit.
He was my best friend.	Hy wie myn bêste freon.
Everyone had that.	Dat hie elkenien.
Do not worry about how often this happens.	Meitsje jo gjin soargen oer hoe faak dat bart.
Maybe she was wrong.	Miskien wie se ferkeard.
I just can no longer.	Ik kin gewoan net mear.
Not like other people.	Net as oare minsken.
It's that time of year again.	It is wer dy tiid fan it jier.
She came to me.	Se kaam by my.
I do not have to.	Ik moat net.
He wanted to know that she wanted to be his wife.	Hy woe witte dat se syn frou wêze woe.
I have never heard from him again to this day.	Ik haw oant hjoed de dei nea wer fan him heard.
Let us have no more.	Lit ús net mear hawwe.
But it was actually more than that.	Mar it wie eins mear as dat.
You have nothing to give.	Jo hawwe neat te jaan.
She's not really sick.	Se is net echt siik.
There was not much more to say.	Der wie net folle mear te sizzen.
But there should not be.	Mar der moat net wêze.
She often does.	Dat docht se faak.
He could now go to bed.	Hy koe no mei bêd.
I think for the money it's the way to go.	Ik tink dat foar it jild de manier is om te gean.
One reason is that we do not need one.	Ien reden is dat wy gjin ien nedich hawwe.
I worked for my father.	Ik haw foar myn heit wurke.
Ask your family.	Freegje jo famylje.
Probably just me.	Wierskynlik allinnich ik.
I'm just on a job.	Ik bin krekt op in baan.
I do not have it.	Ik haw it net.
Everything was fine.	Alles wie goed.
She looked over.	Se seach oer.
There were people who really knew what was happening.	Der wiene minsken dy't echt wisten wat der barde.
Come on everyone, let's eat.	Kom op elkenien, litte wy ite.
I want you to know.	Ik wol dat jo it witte.
That's what I like so much.	Dat wol ik sa graach.
I do not know anyone here.	Ik ken hjir gjinien.
I once did the same thing to my father.	Ik die eartiids itselde ding tsjin myn heit.
When we're here, we're here.	As wy hjir binne, binne wy ​​hjir.
They did not know what had affected them.	Se wisten net wat har rekke wie.
I got it wrong.	Ik haw it ferkeard.
And boy, did he let me have it.	En jonge, liet er my it hawwe.
Not to mention me.	Net te hawwen oer my.
But they make us who we are.	Mar se meitsje ús wa't wy binne.
They should not tell you what to do.	Se moatte jo net fertelle wat te dwaan.
She had a pretty nice life.	Se hie in aardich moai libben.
For the whole year.	Foar it hiele jier.
He says one of us.	Hy seit ien fan ús.
I love them all !.	Ik hâld fan se allegear!.
He watched the whole movie.	Hy seach de hiele film.
Then we can hope.	Dan kinne wy ​​wol hoopje.
But she does not want to tell me anything more.	Mar se wol my neat mear fertelle.
I want to be free of that.	Dêr wol ik frij fan.
But he got none.	Mar hy hat gjinien krigen.
That was what she had hoped would happen.	Dat hie se hope dat it barre soe.
What should she think?	Wat moat se tinke?
And really happy.	En echt bliid.
So they reached out to him.	Sa rekke se nei him.
But no one knows.	Mar nimmen wit.
Go, but be careful.	Gean, mar wês foarsichtich.
Until school started.	Oant de skoalle begûn.
It would not be tomorrow.	It soe gjin moarn wêze.
She was very ready.	Se wie tige klear.
He looked closely to see what would happen then.	Hy seach goed om te sjen wat der dan barre soe.
We do not know how.	Wy witte net hoe.
I did nothing wrong.	Ik die neat ferkeard.
There can be no one without the other.	Der kin net ien sûnder de oare.
I'm fine with this.	Ik bin goed mei dizze.
He looked to see if there was anyone he could.	Hy seach om te sjen oft der immen wie dy't er koe.
He could not have told you anything.	Hy kin dy neat sein hawwe.
Maybe one day, but not yet.	Miskien op in dei, mar noch net.
He did not like this at all.	Hy mocht dit hielendal net.
He would like it.	Hy soe it leuk fine.
You're so nice.	Do bist sa aardich.
Maybe he should go in there and do that.	Miskien moast er der yn gean en dat dwaan.
I have a few at work.	Ik haw in pear oan it wurk.
But not at the door.	Mar net by de doar.
She could not go back and tell her.	Se koe net werom gean en it har fertelle.
He had thought of me.	Hy hie oan my tocht.
You know you want to.	Jo witte dat jo wolle.
Not enough time.	Net genôch tiid.
They will do things differently there.	Se sille dêr dingen oars dwaan.
I can not ask for it.	Ik kin it net freegje.
That's the problem.	Dat is it probleem.
I had a name.	Ik hie in namme.
This time she was not too late.	Dizze kear wie se net te let.
I will never be ready.	Ik sil noait klear wêze.
There must be something you are afraid of.	D'r moat wat wêze wêr't jo bang foar binne.
She found it so much better.	Se fûn it sa better.
I will not be away long.	Ik sil net lang fuort wêze.
I will not do that.	Dat sil ik net dwaan.
It was very fun.	It wie hiel leuk.
But a few things need to be clear.	Mar in pear dingen moatte dúdlik wêze.
That's what it does.	Dat hat it wol.
You have to go all out.	Jo moatte allegear gean.
You can do something else.	Jo kinne wat oars dwaan.
But now it's not over.	Mar no is it der net oer.
I could not find the reason.	Ik koe de reden net fine.
It's not our problem.	It is net ús probleem.
I heard about it almost every day.	Ik hearde der hast alle dagen oer.
I do not need your money.	Ik haw dyn jild net nedich.
I need everyone to do their job.	Ik moat elkenien har wurk dwaan.
Then he had even more problems.	Dan hie er noch mear problemen.
I do not know what kind.	Ik wit net hokker soarte.
You've been really nice.	Do bist echt aardich west.
Think about what you are doing.	Tink oer wat jo dogge.
I have something you need to look into.	Ik haw wat dat jo moatte sjen nei.
He talks in there.	Hy praat der yn.
This is just one thing.	Dit is mar ien ding.
And do not go there.	En moat der net hinne.
Everyone has them.	Elkenien hat se.
I never had to.	Ik moast nea.
He will never return to her.	Hy sil nea werom nei har.
I will not be here.	Ik sil hjir net wêze.
Something came back.	Der kaam wat werom.
This is her first time coming.	Dit is har earste kear dat se komt.
That's what we tried.	Dat ha wy besocht.
He needs to go home and see his children.	Hy moat nei hûs en sjen syn bern.
But she's not talking to me.	Mar se praat net mei my.
He ate his favorite food.	Hy iet syn favorite iten.
Also after everything that has happened.	Ek nei alles wat der bard is.
Food, the best.	Iten, it bêste.
Here's what happened.	Hjir is wat der bard is.
Things happen, he said.	Dingen barre, sei er.
I asked a few people.	Ik frege in pear minsken.
But it's getting better.	Mar it wurdt better.
If you're tired, look up and see!	As jo ​​wurch binne, sjoch op en sjoch!
I did not really know what to say.	Ik wist net echt wat ik sizze moast.
And that was really hard for me.	En dat wie echt dreech foar my.
He's a great guy.	Hy is in grutte keardel.
Not sure what's going on.	Net wis wat der oan de hân is.
That was not the case in other days.	Dat wie yn oare dagen net sa.
In fact, even this is not so clear.	Eins is sels dit net sa dúdlik.
He would not say why.	Hy soe net sizze wêrom.
He could, but he did not.	Hy koe, mar hy die net.
Too late in the day.	Te let op de dei.
He was very glad he had gone home again.	Hy wie tige bliid dat er wer nei hûs gien wie.
So he heard.	Sa hearde er.
But few do.	Mar in pear dogge it.
Maybe he was a.	Miskien wie hy in.
We just know it now.	Wy witte it no wol mar.
It's finding a job.	It is it finen fan in baan.
It's too easy to be good.	It is te maklik om goed te wêzen.
I do not want you to think of me.	Ik wol net dat jo oan my tinke.
For me, this works even better.	Foar my wurket dit noch better.
I do not know anyone like that.	Ik ken net ien sa'n.
I know him better than anyone.	Ik ken him better as immen.
Did he have a wife or a child?	Hie er in frou of in bern?
No one has seen her since.	Gjinien hat har sûnt sjoen.
She did not want to get out of bed.	Se woe net út bêd.
My mother was very happy.	Myn mem wie tige bliid.
Your new book is coming soon.	Jo nije boek komt gau.
You'll have to tell her.	Jo sille it har fertelle moatte.
It once was not.	It wie eartiids net.
We could not stay with her.	Wy koene net by har bliuwe.
This was enough for this evening.	Dit wie genôch foar dizze jûn.
I have to tell my husband.	Ik moat it myn man fertelle.
Maybe he's never going to find you.	Miskien sil er dy noait yn fine.
Until last week.	Oant ferline wike.
Many people would have seen them.	In protte minsken soene har sjoen hawwe.
Go out and buy it, now.	Gean út en keapje it, no.
This man is.	Dizze man is.
She will not give easily.	Se sil net maklik jaan.
I feel this.	Ik fiel dit.
That should have been it all.	Dat hie it allegear wêze moatten.
Let me help.	Lit my helpe.
I had enough of that.	Dêr hie ik genôch fan.
We can not do without water.	Wy kinne net sûnder wetter.
Who knows what happened.	Wa wit wat der bard is.
We are leaving early today, he says.	Wy geane hjoed betiid fuort, seit er.
It's not about me.	It giet net oer my.
He works there too.	Hy wurket dêr ek.
But we made a good movie.	Mar wy hawwe in goede film makke.
I'm looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der nei út.
I thought they were true at the time.	Ik tocht dat se wier wiene op 'e tiid.
I have two parents.	Ik haw twa âlden.
Also, make sure it works.	Soargje der ek foar dat it wurket.
They had it coming.	Se hiene it kommen.
Do it right.	Doch it goed.
My kids have been very happy there.	Myn bern hawwe dêr tige bliid west.
She had no idea how she knew this.	Se hie gjin idee hoe't se dit wist.
But she could not be happier about it much more.	Mar se koe der net oer folle mear bliid wêze.
You have to stop.	Jo moatte ophâlde.
She seemed to have it all.	Se like it allegear te hawwen.
I've never been like this before.	Ik haw noch noait sa west.
We are told to persevere.	Wy wurde ferteld om út te hâlden.
They live where they work.	Se wenje wêr't se wurkje.
We can not agree.	Wy kinne it net iens wurde.
I did not think so.	Ik tocht it net.
Not anymore.	Net mear.
You know what you have there.	Jo witte wat jo dêr hawwe.
They'll get enough, and that's it.	Se sille genôch krije, en dat is it.
And his father.	En syn heit.
There is still no reason to do so.	Der is noch gjin reden om dat te dwaan.
It's pretty easy.	It is frij maklik.
He still felt.	Hy fielde noch.
I knew the name.	Ik wist de namme.
There are not many.	Der binne net folle.
This should not happen to a man.	Dit moat net barre mei in man.
I want them to be happy.	Ik wol dat se bliid wêze.
But that's gone now.	Mar dat is no fuort.
It was not here before.	It wie hjir net earder.
I would not hurt either.	Ik soe beide gjin sear hawwe.
She liked them both.	Se mocht se beide.
Let me show everyone who does not do this.	Lit my elkenien sjen dy't dit net docht.
You can not ask for much better than that.	Jo kinne net freegje om folle better as dat.
All she wanted to do was be free.	Alles wat se dwaan woe wie frij wêze.
Both will do.	Beide sil dwaan.
Tonight would be good.	Fannacht soe goed wêze.
That should not be the case.	Dat moat net sa wêze.
Well, let him.	No, lit him.
He did not stay there.	Hy bleau der net by.
He probably will.	Hy wierskynlik wol.
I think we'll have to wait and see.	Ik tink dat wy sille moatte wachtsje en sjen.
I was already good.	Ik wie al goed.
I just would never have thought of it.	Ik soe it gewoan noait tocht hawwe.
He knows it.	Hy wit it.
She had to find even more words.	Se moast noch mear wurden fine.
She was good to my kids and me.	Se wie goed foar myn bern en my.
I can not believe how well everything is going with you.	Ik kin it net leauwe hoe goed alles mei dy giet.
No people are so beautiful.	Gjin minsken binne sa moai.
They would like to see her.	Se soene har wol sjen.
I'm sorry.	Dat spyt my.
But this was something very different.	Mar dit wie wat hiel oars.
Can I be the first to see ?.	Kin ik de earste wêze om te sjen?.
Talk and talk.	Praat en praat.
They took care of his life.	Se soargen foar syn libben.
You can do that.	Dat kinne jo dwaan.
I have to go now.	Ik moat no fuort.
Until next year !.	Oant takom jier!.
No, lit, lit.	No, lit, lit.
But please help.	Mar help asjebleaft.
I can have something better.	Ik kin better wat ha'.
You will like it.	Jo sille it leuk fine.
Without it, you just can not do it.	Sûnder it kinne jo it gewoan net meitsje.
They are waiting for him.	Se wachtsje op him.
I think it looks really nice so far.	Ik tink dat it oant no ta echt moai sjocht.
Only the first.	Allinnich de earste.
He was like the father she would have liked.	Hy wie as de heit dy't se graach hawwe soe.
To find out what happened and where he was.	Om út te finen wat der bard is en wêr't hy wie.
They were out there.	Se wiene der út.
He could tell her this.	Hy koe har dit fertelle.
She has three children.	Se hat trije bern.
He's a great man.	Hy is in grutte man.
She liked that guy.	Se mocht fan dy keardel.
As if they are not there.	As binne se der net.
Nice, kids.	Moai, bern.
Next year it should get better.	Takom jier moat it better wurde.
That was good, he thought.	Dat wie goed, tocht er.
I do not know why actually.	Ik wit net wêrom eins.
And it is, really.	En it is, echt.
He does not look well.	Hy sjocht der net goed út.
Very nice in your hand.	Hiel moai yn jo hân.
About what comes next.	Oer wat dan komt.
I'll look into it.	Ik sil der nei sjen.
But it did not feel right.	Mar it fielde net goed.
You have to make money.	Jo moatte meitsje jild.
And we are ready for that.	En dêr binne wy ​​klear foar.
Believe that please.	Leau dat asjebleaft.
I take it with me.	Ik nim it mei.
Anyone can be seen.	Elkenien kin sjoen wurde.
Give it more time.	Jou it mear tiid.
I have done this a few times.	Ik haw dat in pear kear dien.
When she was happy, he knew it.	Doe't se bliid wie, wist er it.
If you can find one.	As jo ​​​​ien kinne fine.
Somehow it does not matter.	Op ien of oare manier makket it neat út.
He's here tonight.	Hy is hjir fannacht.
If you know a way, tell us.	As jo ​​​​in manier witte, fertel it ús.
He would help me.	Hy soe my helpe.
What to do.	Wat dwaan.
That's not what it says.	Dat is net wat it seit.
They are not afraid.	Se binne net bang.
I do not have that.	Dat haw ik net.
So he could be with her.	Sa koe er by har wêze.
I want him.	Ik wol him.
I have to make this for everyone.	Ik moat dit foar elkenien meitsje.
You see and not be with you.	Jo sjen en net by dy wêze.
What's happening? 	Wat bart der?
I think this is true.	Ik tink dat dit wier is.
I thought it was fun.	Ik tocht it wie leuk.
In other words, you should always know your place.	Mei oare wurden, jo moatte altyd jo plak witte.
That's what we need.	Dat moatte wy hawwe.
Things were not right.	Dingen wiene net goed.
It lasted many days.	It bleau in protte dagen.
It seems we have the same idea.	It liket derop dat wy itselde idee hawwe.
And everyone is against us.	En elkenien is tsjin ús.
Please take it.	Nim it asjebleaft.
They are fine with that.	Dêr binne se goed mei.
No one will know.	Nimmen sil it witte.
It does its job as best it can.	It docht syn wurk sa goed it kin.
Or so the song went.	Of sa gie it liet.
All we can do now is wait.	Alles wat wy no kinne dwaan is wachtsje.
But he can not have this.	Mar hy kin dit net hawwe.
She does not look scared.	Se sjocht net bang.
She could not see.	Se koe net sjen.
She had to ask.	Se moast freegje.
Of course, it was nothing of the sort.	Fansels wie it neat fan it soarte.
But there she was, the same.	Mar dêr wie se, itselde.
Believe me.	Leau my.
Visit me there.	Besykje my dêr.
It's time to dump her and move on.	It is tiid om it te dwaan.
I knew better now.	Ik wist no better.
I totally regret that.	Dat spyt my hielendal.
I have enough time.	Ik haw genôch tiid.
The water was sitting.	It wetter siet.
He touched his chin.	Hy rekke syn kin oan.
This is open.	Dit is iepen.
People certainly talk a lot.	Minsken prate wis in protte.
Too busy to get out today.	Te drok om hjoed út te kommen.
I tried to tell her.	Ik besocht it har te fertellen.
They do not know who they are eating now.	Se witte net wa't se no ite.
He was ready for it.	Hy wie der klear foar.
I want to see her picture.	Ik wol har foto sjen.
Everyone is different.	Elkenien is oars.
He should be home by now.	Hy soe no thús wêze moatte.
Everything else today will talk about him.	Al it oare hjoed sil oer him prate.
I would like to help her.	Ik soe har helpe wolle.
That does not matter.	Dat makket neat út.
They just keep coming and going.	Se bliuwe gewoan komme en komme.
But it was not enough.	Mar it wie net genôch.
She wants to help.	Se helpe wol.
They know a lot about each other.	Se witte in protte oer elkoar.
That happens, quite often.	Dat bart, frij faak.
We will never have enough food.	Wy sille nea genôch iten hawwe.
There it was, mother her water.	Dêr wie it, mem har wetter.
I know she can.	Ik wit dat se kin.
He ran as hard as he could.	Hy rûn sa hurd as er koe.
Never would there be a better time.	Nea soe der in bettere tiid wêze.
She has no friends here.	Se hat hjir gjin freonen.
That was it, really.	Dat wie it, echt.
But you do it.	Mar jo dogge it.
I see the problem.	Ik sjoch it probleem.
He will make it himself.	Hy sil it sels meitsje.
That's what we want to be.	Dat wolle wy wêze.
I was sure of that.	Dêr wie ik wis fan.
One was that he felt better.	Ien wie dat er him better fielde.
very beautiful	Hiel moai.
But it did not feel right.	Mar it fielde net goed.
But not as what you think.	Mar net as wat jo tinke.
But she could not wait.	Mar se koe net wachtsje.
Really, really good.	Echt, echt goed.
.	.
I still remember trying to talk her out of me.	Ik wit noch dat ik besocht har út my te praten.
It has nothing to do with you.	It hat neat mei dy te krijen.
For it.	Foar it.
Which makes me angry.	Wat my lilk makket.
I'm glad you agree.	Ik bin bliid dat jo it iens binne.
Come and get it !.	Kom en krije it!.
I saw both this weekend.	Ik seach beide dit wykein.
But what if it was me.	Mar wat as it my wie.
Many want more time.	In protte winskje mear tiid.
You will tell him that you love him.	Jo sille him fertelle dat jo fan him hâlde.
Do not eat too much!	Net te folle ite!
I'll find one.	Ik sil ien fine.
As in never.	As yn nea.
Children do not go to school.	Bern geane net nei skoalle.
He was too alone.	Hy wie te allinnich.
He looked at it.	Hy seach der nei.
I have nothing against him.	Ik haw neat tsjin him.
It was all so real.	It wie allegear sa echt.
They would not have to worry about him anymore.	Se soene har gjin soargen mear oer him hoege te meitsjen.
We hope you enjoy the stay.	Wy hoopje dat jo it leuk fine om hjir te bliuwen.
No one else can do it.	Nimmen oars kin it dwaan.
I did not know what had happened.	Ik wist net wat der bard wie.
I do this often.	Ik doch dit faak.
The water was gone.	It wetter wie fuort.
He said he had something he needed to talk to us about.	Hy sei dat hy wat hie wêr't hy mei ús oer prate moast.
That was what this felt like.	Dat wie wat dit fielde.
We should not be.	Wy moatte net wêze.
He does not talk much.	Hy prate net folle.
Go to bed.	Gean op bêd.
It was probably in the car.	It wie wierskynlik yn 'e auto.
You have done so much for me.	Do hast safolle foar my dien.
It makes you question things.	It makket jo fragen oer dingen.
This was my life.	Dit wie myn libben.
We knew it was not all about the money for us.	Wy wisten dat it net alles oer it jild foar ús gie.
They have a chance.	Se hawwe in kâns.
And probably the best he does not do.	En wierskynlik it bêste dat er net docht.
I do not know if that will work itself.	Ik wit net oft dat sels sil wurkje.
In other words, try it.	Mei oare wurden, besykje it.
I hope to talk to you again soon.	Ik hoopje gau wer mei jo te praten.
But there was not enough work for everyone who came.	Mar der wie net genôch wurk foar elkenien dy't kaam.
You have to love them.	Jo moatte fan har hâlde.
You go up and eat it.	Jo geane op en yt it.
Not two, not three.	Net twa, net trije.
I did not see.	Ik seach net.
When are you planning to have children?	Wannear binne jo fan plan om bern te hawwen?
Been at work all day.	De hiele dei oan it wurk west.
Told me to see him.	Sei my om him te sjen.
We'll get him.	Wy sille him krije.
Nothing else was done.	Der waard oars neat oan dien.
Even if they say they are ready, they really need to be ready.	Sels as se sizze dat se klear binne, moatte se echt klear wêze.
I do not show my children it.	Ik lit myn bern it net sjen.
It's very ordinary.	It is hiel gewoan.
And he will do bad things.	En hy sil minne dingen dwaan.
It did not seem that she was happy to be there.	It like der net op dat se bliid wie dêr te wêzen.
This did not have one.	Dit hie net ien.
There had been so much happening since that day.	Der wie safolle bard sûnt dy dei.
I got a house.	Ik krige in hûs.
Well, he said again.	Goed, sei er wer.
It will not be a school.	It sil gjin skoalle wurde.
Now that will be fun !!.	No dat sil wêze leuk!!.
Take a good look at this photo.	Sjoch goed nei dizze foto.
Not a woman looking away.	Net in frou dy't fuort sjocht.
That was what he had heard.	Dat wie wat er heard hie.
But she knew he did not come like that.	Mar se wist dat er net sa kaam.
There is no way around it.	Der is gjin wei om it hinne.
I could not see the words.	Ik koe de wurden net sjen.
I saw him for the first time.	Ik seach him foar it earst.
But it was too late.	Mar it wie te let.
He's not for you.	Hy is net foar dy.
I'm just like that.	Ik bin der gewoan as .
There was nothing.	Dêr wie neat.
I felt that everyone should somehow know what had happened to me.	Ik fielde dat elkenien ien of oare manier moat witte wat my bard wie.
It's the thing done.	It is it dien ding.
She loves him very much.	Se hâldt tige fan him.
One week is just one week.	Ien wike is mar ien wike.
A way to get to them.	In manier om by har te kommen.
I was very tired.	Ik wie tige wurch.
It will not be easy.	It sil net maklik wêze.
That was not her.	Dat wie har net.
It's never too late to stop eating.	It is noait te let om op te hâlden mei iten.
And help each other.	En elkoar helpe.
A man works hard.	In man wurket hurd.
I should have known they would find me again.	Ik hie witte moatten dat se my wer fine soene.
He would never believe it, but he is her favorite child.	Hy soe it noait leauwe, mar hy is har favorite bern.
You were the one who wanted him.	Jo wiene dejinge dy't him woe.
I have lived here my whole life.	Ik haw hjir myn hiele libben wenne.
But not such a car.	Mar net sa'n auto.
This is my last.	Dit is myn lêste.
Nobody wanted her.	Nimmen woe har.
He saw everything across the room, but saw nothing.	Hy seach alles oer de keamer, mar seach neat.
There is never enough.	Der is noait genôch.
She was waiting for him.	Se wachte op him.
The police saw the man.	De plysje seach de man.
Let me tell you that it does not work.	Lit my jo fertelle dat it net wurket.
Of the faith itself.	Fan it leauwe sels.
I always think so and so do you.	Dat tink ik altyd en jo ek.
Now it has come to this.	No is it sa kommen.
Before you say a word, he makes you.	Foardat jo in wurd sizze, makket hy dy.
If it works, it works.	As it wurket, wurket it.
I want that kind of life.	Ik wol dat soarte fan libben.
The man was the only thing he knew.	De man wie it iennichste dat er wist.
I was not sure if it would.	Ik wie net wis oft it soe.
Well, the first day is just that.	No, de earste dei is gewoan.
Maybe for you, he would.	Miskien foar jo, hy soe.
Must be fun.	Moat leuk wêze.
She wants to talk to you.	Se wol mei dy prate.
She had become really beautiful.	Se wie echt moai wurden.
I'm getting really good at this.	Ik wurd hjir echt goed yn.
I can not tell you how it happened.	Ik kin jo net fertelle hoe't it bard is.
He was waiting for me to make this better.	Hy wachte op my om dit better te meitsjen.
You had to know.	Do moast witte.
Maybe you want to try something different.	Miskien wolle jo wat oars besykje.
It will be so much better.	It sil sa better wêze.
Hardly anyone thought such a day would come.	Hast gjinien tocht dat sa'n dei komme soe.
But he did not say that.	Mar dat sei er net.
I do this completely.	Ik doch dit hielendal.
But you can not just look at her house at this hour.	Mar jo kinne net gewoan op dit oere by har hûs sjen.
That you can tell.	Dat kinne jo fertelle.
Not that he could do much.	Net dat er folle dwaan koe.
And this year is no different.	En dit jier is net oars.
You will never stop now.	Jo sille no noait ophâlde.
Could not.	Koe net.
It was done quickly.	It wie gau dien.
Just like that.	Krekt sa en.
Let it stop.	Lit it ophâlde.
That is no longer the problem.	Dat is net mear it probleem.
If not it will be.	As net sil it wêze.
You can handle it.	Jo kinne it oan.
You get this all wrong.	Jo krije dit allegear ferkeard.
He could not believe what he heard.	Hy koe net leauwe wat er hearde.
It felt good to be out there.	It fielde goed om der út te wêzen.
We do not do that now.	Dat dogge wy no net.
How does this work exactly?	Hoe wurket dit krekt?
But that was about him, not about the family.	Mar dat gie oer him, net oer de famylje.
I have what we need.	Ik haw wat wy nedich hawwe.
Anyone with the same problem.	Elkenien mei itselde probleem.
We were so happy.	Wy wiene sa bliid.
Do not worry, you will get it.	Sit gjin soargen, jo sille it krije.
Hadn't said a word the whole time.	Hie de hiele tiid gjin wurd sein.
They just do not know.	Se witte it gewoan net.
This is not pretty.	Dizze is net moai.
I know, neither do I.	Ik wit it, ik ek net.
I have no idea how to do any of this.	Ik haw gjin idee hoe te dwaan wat fan dit.
I was never sick to talk about.	Ik wie noait siik om oer te praten.
They do not want to work with a woman.	Se wolle net mei in frou wurkje.
You are among friends.	Jo binne ûnder freonen.
So we got some kids.	Sa krigen wy in pear bern.
Not what you think.	Net wat jo tinke.
People talk to me.	Minsken prate tsjin my.
With her children in her.	Mei har bern yn har.
I was against.	Ik wie tsjin.
Not many even tried.	Net in protte sels besocht.
He was very ill.	Hy wie tige siik.
I'm afraid to say anything about what happened.	Ik bin bang om wat te fertellen oer wat der bard is.
One by one, please come up.	Ien foar ien, kom asjebleaft op.
She had come ready.	Se wie klear kommen.
I wanted to help him right away.	Ik woe him fuort helpe.
I do not think everything is over.	Ik tink net dat alles op is.
No one seems to.	Gjinien liket te.
And he did not know if he had done the right thing.	En hy wist net oft er it goede dien hie.
Do not believe everything you find.	Leau net alles wat jo fine.
But probably no one will.	Mar wierskynlik sil gjinien.
And he took me with him.	En hy naam my mei.
I thought maybe.	Ik tocht miskien.
She was always there for us.	Se wie der altyd foar ús.
There are many things we do not know.	D'r binne in protte dingen dy't wy net witte.
You can think of me how you want.	Jo kinne oan my tinke hoe't jo wolle.
They will both go.	Se sille beide gean.
A few days become a month.	In pear dagen wurde in moanne.
She wanted to get away, now.	Se woe fuort, no.
He will give you everything he has.	Hy sil jo alles jaan wat er hat.
I do not doubt you.	Ik twifelje net oan dy.
Maybe that can work.	Miskien kin dat wurkje.
It's how we met.	It is hoe't wy moete.
I know it was not easy.	Ik wit dat it net maklik wie.
No idea why.	Gjin idee wêrom.
I need to see this guy.	Ik moat dizze keardel sjen.
Take the police.	Nim de plysje.
No man touched it.	Gjin man rekke it oan.
But I did not find it.	Mar ik fûn it net.
Maybe it was the hair.	Miskien wie it it hier.
I'm at work.	Ik bin oan it wurk.
You are you.	Do bist dy.
Make it right.	Meitsje it goed.
I really am.	Ik echt bin.
He admitted that he was a man of a few words.	Hy joech ta dat hy in man wie fan in pear wurden.
It's another day.	It is in oare dei.
Just as you should.	Krekt as jo moatte.
Be kind to them, they are good people.	Wês aardich foar har, it binne goede minsken.
I should have known for sure.	Ik moast it wis witte.
We do not need this.	Wy hawwe dit net nedich.
He came to me.	Hy kaam by my.
Watch for us in a week.	Sjoch foar ús oer in wike.
He was very clear about that.	Hy wie dêr hiel dúdlik oer.
They were not in it.	Dêr wiene se net yn.
I wonder how old he is, actually.	Ik freegje my ôf hoe âld hy is, eins.
We just know if it works or not.	Wy witte gewoan oft it wurket of net.
You should have found it pretty quickly.	Jo soene it frij gau fûn hawwe.
But this is not enough.	Mar dit is net genôch.
It's the same here.	It is hjir itselde.
That scare him.	Dy't him bang meitsje.
I tried to help.	Ik besocht te helpen.
There was one door.	Der wie ien doar.
I hope this is better.	Ik hoopje dat dit better is.
They can do whatever they want.	Se kinne dwaan wat se wolle.
She knew him better now.	Se koe him no better.
They come here.	Se komme hjir.
He sees it now too.	Hy sjocht it no ek.
It knows me and what in me knows it.	It ken my en wat yn my wit it.
Which of course is what these two people are.	Wat fansels is wat dizze twa minsken binne.
You want them to come.	Jo wolle dat se komme.
And the boy will tell her.	En de jonge sil it har fertelle.
You and your mother.	Do en dyn mem.
She had to be there.	Se moast der wêze.
They get to see the whole book.	Se krije it hiele boek te sjen.
And become words.	En wurden wurden.
She did it very well.	Se hat it hiel goed dien.
This had never happened before.	Dit wie noch noait earder bard.
I wanted to get them home in a way that was not expected.	Ik woe se thús krije op in manier dy't net ferwachte wie.
It will never work.	It sil noait wurkje.
Looking forward to seeing him again.	Sjoch út nei him wer te sjen.
I have nothing else to do, really.	Ik haw neat oars te dwaan, echt.
Everything he did all his life was exactly what he wanted.	Alles wat er syn hiele libben dien hat wie krekt wat er woe.
But that's his name.	Mar dat is syn namme.
She says she knows it.	Se seit dat se it wit.
We knew this day was coming.	Wy wisten dat dizze dei soe komme.
We were alone in the room.	Wy wiene allinnich yn 'e keamer.
So they do it.	Sa dogge se it.
These things happen.	Dizze dingen barre.
A mother knows best, but a father may not agree.	In mem wit it bêste, mar in heit kin it net iens wêze.
This is one thing that happens.	Dit is in ding dat bart.
I think life.	Ik tink dat it libben.
But this time we were ready.	Mar dizze kear wiene wy ​​klear.
Hope you can help.	Hoopje kinne jo helpe.
But you're here, not home.	Mar do bist hjir, net nei hûs.
Who loves water?	Wa hâldt fan wetter?
This did not happen.	Dit is net bard.
They can not do that in class, there is not enough time.	Dat kinne se net yn 'e klasse, der is net genôch tiid.
It really, really, does.	It echt, echt, docht.
Where were they now, she wondered.	Wêr wiene se no, frege se har ôf.
And what about me.	En wat is my oer.
She comes from a good family.	Se komt út in goede famylje.
That does not happen that often.	Dat komt net sa faak foar.
Until last week, it works well.	Oant ferline wike wurket it goed.
She had to be with him, help him.	Se moast by him wêze, him helpe.
And this is the same thing.	En dit is itselde ding.
We work hard enough.	Wy wurkje hurd genôch.
I know the people who have it.	Ik ken de minsken dy't it hawwe.
That said, what makes me happy are things.	Dat sei, wat my bliid makket, binne dingen.
He really wanted that.	Dat woe er tige.
But there you know what they did.	Mar dêr witte jo wat se dien hawwe.
Pour as much water as you can into the bowl.	Giet safolle wetter as jo kinne yn 'e kom.
You will need them.	Jo sille se nedich hawwe.
So it's right now.	Sa is it no krekt.
Sure, there must be something.	Wis, der moat wat wêze.
It's still going on.	It giet ek noch.
And that should have been so.	En dat hie sa wêze moatten.
They now work in the city.	Se wurkje no yn de stêd.
That was him now.	Dat wie hy no.
She had work to do.	Se hie wurk te dwaan.
He looked up at me.	Hy seach op nei my.
He's gone too.	Hy is ek fuort.
And it has nothing else.	En it hat neat oars.
But not by me, who has no words.	Mar net troch my, dy't gjin wurden hat.
I do not want to see him do that.	Ik wol him dat net dwaan sjen.
He wanted his father for himself.	Hy woe syn heit foar himsels.
Here come the children.	Hjir komme de bern.
The boy does not know what to say.	De jonge wit net wat te sizzen.
I had no idea what to do.	Ik hie gjin idee wat te dwaan.
All the best.	Al it goede.
We will play again next year.	Wy spylje takom jier wer.
And they can win.	En se kinne winne.
It can work and can not work.	It kin wurkje en kin net wurkje.
You come to my house and ask these questions.	Jo komme by my thús en freegje dizze fragen.
It must be one of his father.	It moat ien fan syn heit wêze.
You're out there.	Do bist der út.
They will find you.	Se sille dy fine.
Everyone loves him.	Elkenien hâlde fan him.
But let's wait.	Mar litte wy wachtsje.
Not really very good, but really very bad.	Net echt hiel goed, mar echt hiel min.
It is the feast of life.	It is it feest fan it libben.
And we will do it soon.	En wy sille it gau dwaan.
Try with this.	Besykje mei dizze.
It happens to me a lot.	It bart mei my in protte.
Let's go there.	Lit ús der hinne gean.
Never seen.	Nea sjoen.
He's really bad.	Hy is echt min.
I'm your very good friend.	Ik bin jo heul goede freon.
Now the police say a lot of the same thing.	No seit de plysje in protte itselde.
I want to see him.	Ik wol him sjen.
He never wants that to happen again.	Hy wol dat noait wer barre.
I want to go there, she said.	Ik wol der hinne, sei se.
He's sure.	Hy is wis.
I came here for one reason and only one reason.	Ik kaam hjir foar ien reden en mar ien reden.
She received a letter from a friend.	Se krige in brief troch in freon.
You come to me for food.	Jo komme by my foar iten.
But that's just us.	Mar dat binne gewoan wy.
Not that he had not tried.	Net dat er net besocht hie.
Mom in a house.	Mem yn in hûs.
She did not look at it.	Se seach der net nei.
Don't try to see me again.	Besykje my net wer wat te sjen.
You will not be able to help your friends.	Jo sille jo freonen net kinne helpe.
There was also reason in it.	Der siet ek reden yn.
They want to be ready.	Se wolle klear wêze.
We're getting it right.	Wy krije it goed.
They come through.	Se komme troch.
The man is a teacher.	De man is learaar.
So the question is too early.	Sa is de fraach te betiid.
And there was no one else.	En dêr wie gjinien oars.
There is no one way that will work best for everyone.	D'r is gjin ien manier dy't it bêste foar elkenien sil wurkje.
That we must show.	Dat moatte wy sjen litte.
Or try to.	Of besykje te.
She had made me angry.	Se hie my lilk makke.
I could not get to it.	Ik koe der net by komme.
Make my friends out.	Meitsje myn freonen út.
There was no one to help her.	Der wie gjinien om har te helpen.
Or maybe it was this one.	Of miskien wie it dizze.
It was like being a child again.	It wie as wer in bern.
We'll talk to this girl.	Wy sille mei dit famke prate.
Just like last time.	Krekt as de lêste kear.
She would not let them do this to her.	Se soe se dit net oan har dwaan litte.
He really is a great man.	Hy is echt in grutte man.
It was the only thing he had left of her.	It wie it iennichste dat er fan har oer hie.
You will be free.	Jo sille frij wêze.
Not and go away with it.	Net en gean fuort mei it.
But this would work.	Mar dit soe wurkje.
No woman to help.	Gjin frou om te helpen.
I would get hurt.	Ik soe sear krije.
They have already started talking about it.	Se binne der al oer begûn te praten.
I tried to get things right.	Ik besocht dingen goed te krijen.
But she did not try very hard.	Mar se besocht net hiel hurd.
It was always his name.	It wie altyd syn namme.
Just tell me.	Fertel it my gewoan.
What kind of man was he?	Wat foar man wie hy?
I doubt they are on them.	Ik twifelje oft se op har binne.
But you go first.	Mar jo geane earst.
She had to say something.	Se moast wat sizze.
Here is a picture taken at the meeting.	Hjir is in foto makke by de gearkomste.
Tell us this and you can go home.	Fertel ús dit en jo kinne nei hûs.
Life is beautiful!	It libben is moai!
We have always loved each other.	Wy hawwe altyd fan elkoar hâlden.
He had done it himself, as a child.	Hy hie it sels dien, as bern.
I can do nothing to her.	Ik kin neat oan har dwaan.
Just that they are not doing us any good.	Krekt dat se ús net echt goed dogge.
Maybe it was what she wanted.	Miskien wie it wat se woe.
In his words, the words were clear.	Yn syn wurden wiene de wurden dúdlik.
It turned out pretty well.	It kaam frij goed út.
He was ready, and he could.	Hy wie klear, en hy koe.
I can see him now.	Ik kin him no sjen.
I woke up late again.	Ik waard wer let wekker.
I did not have to go through with it.	Ik hoegde der net troch te gean.
What do you know about family or friends?	Wat witte jo oer famylje of freonen?
It's not what they've done before.	It is net wat se earder dien hawwe.
Now we do everything together.	No dogge wy alles tegearre.
We talk without saying anything.	Wy prate sûnder wat te sizzen.
There may be one more.	Der kin noch ien wêze.
This should be clear.	Dit moat dúdlik wêze.
There are many of us.	D'r binne in protte fan ús.
But he was very much so.	Mar hy wie tige sa.
He did not do it anymore.	Hy die it net mear.
I'm ready.	Ik bin klear.
Everyone says that.	Elkenien seit dat.
They have two children.	Se hawwe twa bern.
It can happen here.	It kin hjir barre.
You ask me where they're going.	Jo freegje my wêr't se hinne gean.
I have never met anyone.	Ik haw noait ien moete.
I love it, of course.	Ik hâld der fansels om.
There could not.	Der koe net.
She would tell them to stop what they were doing.	Se soe har sizze om op te hâlden, wat se diene.
And not done.	En net dien.
Or maybe she could.	Of miskien koe se.
Tell you this.	Fertel dy dit.
Good for him.	Goed foar him.
She almost hit a boy with her car.	Se rekke hast in jonge mei har auto.
Make it yours.	Meitsje it fan jo.
Not that you need.	Net dat jo nedich hawwe.
He ran and ran and ran.	Hy rûn en rûn en rûn.
I know it's time for us to talk.	Ik wit dat it tiid is foar ús om te praten.
They pay in.	Se betelje yn.
I was hit.	Ik waard rekke.
I do not know how that could have happened.	Ik wit net hoe't dat barre koe.
And a job is a job.	En in baan is in baan.
The door did not open.	De doar gie net iepen.
Same as you were.	Itselde as jo wiene.
He looks a lot like you.	Hy liket in protte op dy.
I think we'll see what happens.	Ik tink dat wy sille sjen wat der bart.
I'm not needed here anymore.	Ik bin hjir net mear nedich.
I want to know for sure.	Ik wol it foar wis witte.
Even if they do not know it.	Ek al witte se it net.
Not that he was expecting anything.	Net dat er wat ferwachte hie.
He was very ill.	Hy wie tige siik.
They never have.	Se hawwe noait.
Whether she was talking to friends at the time.	Oft se yn dy tiid mei freonen praat.
I'm not one of them.	Ik bin der net ien fan.
Everyone knows who you are.	Elkenien wit wa't jo binne.
And do not worry.	En meitsje jo gjin soargen.
I feel good.	Ik fiel my goed.
Maybe more than that.	Miskien mear as dat.
Even if people do not believe me, it is true.	Sels as minsken my net leauwe, is it wier.
I've never even looked at it.	Ik ha der sels noait nei sjoen.
That's what hair does.	Dat docht hier.
Just be my friend.	Wês gewoan myn freon.
And that’s what this is about.	En dêr giet dit oer.
Tell her what happened.	Fertel har wat der bard is.
It was different this time.	It wie dizze kear oars.
I'm not that person.	Ik bin net dy persoan.
A man of a few words.	In man fan in pear wurden.
In the same way his mother does.	Op deselde manier as syn mem dat docht.
What can be said about this song?	Wat kin sein wurde oer dit liet?
He is done for me.	Hy is dien foar my.
We have enough to eat.	Wy hawwe genôch te iten.
To be sure.	Om der wis fan te wêzen.
I can tell you that well.	Ik kin it dy goed fertelle.
And that's good.	En dat is goed.
He was the father of a large family.	Hy wie de heit fan in grutte famylje.
No one would tell me why.	Nimmen soe my fertelle wêrom.
I'm still in there.	Ik sit der noch yn.
Of course, we never talked about that.	Dêr ha wy fansels nea oer praat.
I could not do without it.	Ik koe der net sûnder.
They probably did not.	Dat diene se wierskynlik net.
I will try that next time.	Dat sil ik de folgjende kear besykje.
In a month.	Oer in moanne.
The young woman's hair was beautiful.	It hier fan de jonge frou wie moai.
He could not believe he had hit it off.	Hy koe net leauwe dat er it rekke hie.
I want to see him, away.	Ik wol him sjen, fuort.
But more came.	Mar der kaam mear.
I thought he needed some help.	Ik tocht dat hy wat help krije moast.
There had been so much to do.	Der hie safolle te dwaan west.
Let us come in a different way.	Lit ús op in oare manier komme.
This she had expected.	Dit hie se ferwachte.
It's hard to look over him.	It is dreech om him oer te sjen.
Until last month.	Oant ferline moanne.
Hope it will be better than the last.	Hoopje dat it better sil wêze as de lêste.
His wife was for him.	Syn frou wie foar him.
That's what you need now.	Dat sille jo no nedich hawwe.
He knows that.	Dat wit er wol.
Reading is nothing.	Lêzen is neat.
The food came quickly.	It iten kaam gau.
She had a child with him.	Se hie in bern by him.
She is not the woman.	Se is de frou net.
He still has hair.	Hy hat noch hier.
But she needed to know more.	Mar se moast mear witte.
Not a bad read.	Net in min lêzen.
This was a lot.	Dit wie in protte.
He looked, waited.	Hy seach, wachte.
No one else did.	Nimmen oars die.
I really am not.	Ik bin echt net.
But he had done none of those things.	Mar hy hie neat fan dy dingen dien.
At my home.	By my thús.
You can not get a job again.	Jo kinne gjin wurk wer krije.
If not here's a new product just for you!	As net, dan kinne jo miskien net folle fine.
I love you	Ik hâld fan dy
But everything looked good, everything looked good.	Mar alles seach der goed út, alles like goed.
Maybe she's interested.	Miskien is se ynteressearre.
First take the question why.	Nim earst de fraach wêrom.
In fact, the woman always looked good.	Eins seach de frou altyd goed ta.
We had a week together.	Wy hiene in wike tegearre.
Well, there was only one way to do it right.	No, d'r wie mar ien manier om dit goed te meitsjen.
He asked him where she was last night.	Hy frege him ôf wêr't se fannacht wie.
It was nice of you to help me.	It wie aardich fan jo om my te helpen.
And she's happy to show you what she has.	En se mei graach sjen litte wat se hat.
I told him about my day.	Ik fertelde him oer myn dei.
It's different but not better.	It is oars mar net better.
It would not get him.	It soe him net krije.
I wondered if he did that with other people.	Ik frege my ôf oft er dat mei oare minsken die.
That was just a job for him.	Dat wie allinnich mar in baan foar him.
They could have been there though.	Se koene der wol west hawwe.
We need to get out of here soon.	Wy moatte gau fuort.
That's what they're after.	Dat binne se nei.
If he was interested, he could find her.	As er ynteressearre wie, koe er har fine.
That's exactly what they did.	Dat diene se krekt.
He gave me a hand.	Hy joech my in hân.
She went on, still talking.	Se gie troch, praat noch.
I was really not sure.	Ik wie der echt net wis fan.
But we can not.	Mar wy kinne net.
Not if you want the door out again.	Net as jo de doar wer út wolle.
Nobody knows where he is.	Nimmen wit wêr't er is.
I could take it or leave it.	Ik koe it nimme of litte.
Talk to people.	Mei minsken prate.
It seemed good.	It like goed.
Otherwise they would not have had a mother at all.	Oars hiene se hielendal gjin mem hân.
But then he walks away.	Mar dan giet er fuort.
From one day.	Fan ien dei.
I've seen you.	Ik haw dy sjoen.
The book makes that clear, too.	It boek makket dat ek dúdlik.
He admitted that too.	Dat joech er ek ta.
Well, that's right here.	No, dat stiet hjir.
No one was here.	Gjinien wie hjir.
He's a good man.	Hy is in goed man.
We go where we need to go.	Wy geane wêr't wy nedich binne.
Everything it could ever be.	Alles wat it oait wêze koe.
They were afraid for their lives.	Se wiene bang foar har libben.
I had enough to go on.	Ik hie genôch om troch te gean.
Buy it now!.	Keapje it no!.
I'll be with you.	Ik sil by dy wêze.
Is it necessary?	Is it nedich?
What happened really affected him.	Wat der barde, kaam him echt oan.
The work can wait.	It wurk kin wachtsje.
That everyone should agree with it there as well.	Dat elkenien it dêr ek mei iens wêze moat.
I'm one of you.	Ik bin ien fan dy.
Tell her what happened.	Fertel har wie bard.
Very good.	In protte goed.
I have tried it, it works well.	Ik haw it besocht, it wurket goed.
You have not been away.	Do hast hast net fuort west.
That's just too long.	Dat is gewoan te lang.
Very well done !.	Hiel goed dien!.
I still remember going a few times.	Ik wit noch dat ik in pear kear gie.
He made good work of it.	Hy makke der goed wurk fan.
Everything would help.	Alles soe helpe.
That should be you.	Dat moatte jo hawwe.
I did the same thing before, it worked well.	Ik die earder itselde ding, it wurke goed.
But he could not, not yet.	Mar hy koe net, noch net.
Otherwise it does not matter.	Oars makket it neat út.
But no one saw him.	Mar nimmen seach him.
Another day done.	Noch in dei dien.
I'm not here for new friends.	Ik bin hjir net foar nije freonen.
But let me make one thing very clear.	Mar lit my ien ding hiel dúdlik meitsje.
It's something else.	It is wat oars.
He wants it bad.	Hy wol it min.
He put off.	Hy sette ôf.
Let me just think.	Lit my mar tinke.
She did not know what her father was like.	Se wist net hoe't har heit wie.
Not that you're sick.	Net mei dat jo siik binne.
I'll see him tomorrow.	Ik sjoch him moarn.
Now you come and ask for more work from me.	No komme jo en freegje om mear wurk út my.
But that was not too often.	Mar dat wie net al te faak.
Well, that was something.	No, dat wie wat.
We do not have the time for that now.	Dêr ha wy no net de tiid foar.
That way no one would see you.	Op dy manier soe nimmen dy sjen.
And they know about me.	En se witte oer my.
I'm looking around here.	Ik sjoch hjir om.
I was surprised.	Ik wie ferrast.
Tell him what to do.	Fertel him wat er dwaan moat.
Well, it does matter, of course.	No, it makket út, fansels.
As a movie.	As in film.
And how she wants to live there.	En hoe't se dêr wenje wol.
See that everything is ready.	Sjoch dat alles klear is.
Can someone please do that.	Kin immen dat asjebleaft dwaan.
This works well.	Dit wurket goed.
That, even more so.	Dat, noch mear.
I was never happy.	Ik wie noait bliid.
It will help you.	It sil jo helpe.
Or they were.	Of se wiene.
I do not know which.	Ik wit net hokker.
There are some good things here.	Der binne wat goede dingen hjir.
I wanted to tell you.	Ik woe it dy sizze.
It is sick and wrong for him not to do so.	It is siik en ferkeard foar him net te dwaan.
My kids were fine.	Myn bern wiene goed.
what was she beautiful.	wat wie se moai.
He said .	Hy sei .
It was busy.	It wie drok.
I was not happy about it.	Ik wie der net bliid fan.
It does exactly the same thing again.	It docht wer krekt itselde ding.
They would eat well.	Se soene goed ite.
With what you tell me.	Mei wat jo my fertelle.
Why it is of course.	Wêrom is it fansels.
But so many are many.	Mar safolle binne in protte.
You may know where it is, but not where it's going.	Jo kinne witte wêr't it is, mar net wêr't it hinne giet.
My words are truth.	Myn wurden binne wierheid.
I looked back at my mother and my father.	Ik seach werom nei myn mem en myn heit.
Is the best for everyone.	Is de bêste foar elkenien.
We proceed with caution.	Wy geane foarsichtich troch.
That's what life is all about.	Dêr giet it libben oer.
I felt very confident.	Ik fielde my tige wis.
It may be different at first.	It kin earst oars wêze.
Do not make him with that girl.	Meitsje him net mei dat famke.
Her mother knew.	Har mem wist.
He felt better.	Hy fielde him better.
I had another reason to come.	Ik hie in oare reden om te kommen.
Of course, this time it was no different.	Fansels wie it dizze kear net oars.
All the better for us.	Al it better foar ús.
I'm thinking about this.	Ik tink hjir oer.
He was still in her life.	Hy wie noch yn har libben.
It's not that hard really.	It is net sa dreech echt.
I would help you in this.	Ik soe helpe jo yn dit.
I'll leave it at that.	Ik sil it der by litte.
To his house.	Nei syn hûs.
I asked her what she would do.	Ik frege har wat se dwaan soe.
They just don’t do it.	Se dogge it net gewoan.
He came and sat with me.	Hy kaam en siet by my.
Boy was everyone surprised.	Jonge wie elkenien ferrast.
She would know it if she saw it.	Se soe it witte as se it seach.
You have to tell her that.	Dat moatte jo har fertelle.
I'm not asking.	Ik freegje net.
Or so you might think.	Of dat soene jo tinke.
I did what was necessary.	Ik die wat nedich wie.
There was a mother.	Der wie in mem.
I never said a word to you.	Ik hie nea in wurd tsjin dy sein.
What is the thing that needs to be done.	Wat is it ding dat dien wurde moat.
But it's better.	Mar it is better.
How long I do not know.	Hoe lang wit ik net.
Or my work.	Of myn wurk.
Let's make some new friends.	Lit ús meitsje wat nije freonen.
Well, that did it for me.	No, dat die it foar my.
I made it out.	Ik die it út.
Nobody likes him.	Nimmen liket him.
Well, she knew how he felt.	No, se wist hoe't er fielde.
It's not hard for me.	It is net dreech foar my.
It felt good to us.	It fielde ús goed.
I've made enough for two.	Ik haw genôch makke foar twa.
The door is slightly open.	De doar stiet wat iepen.
If you hurt, she could handle it.	As jo ​​sear rekke, koe se it oan.
It should not come from you either.	It moat ek net fan dy komme.
Has she been away?	Hat se fuort west?
Were they real ?.	Wiene se echt?.
I want to see.	Ik wol sjen.
Not much chance of that.	Net folle kâns op dat.
I can find them.	Ik kin se fine.
Why did she keep it? 	Wêrom hat se it hâlden?
she asked.	frege se har ôf.
But, it happened.	Mar, it barde.
I could not help but see her in place.	Ik koe it net helpe om har yn plak te sjen.
And family, of course.	En famylje, fansels.
That's going to be a whole day.	Dat wurdt in hiele dei.
An opportunity presented itself.	In kâns die him foar.
I think you know what that reason is.	Ik tink dat jo witte wat dy reden is.
Just her being made me whole.	Krekt har wêzen makke my hiel.
He just wants to get rid of everything.	Hy wol gewoan fan alles ôf.
They have it there.	Se hawwe it dêr.
I had the best time ever.	Ik hie de bêste tiid hân.
I'll think about it.	Ik sil der wol oan tinke.
She had always been that way.	Se hie altyd sa west.
They may not even have tomorrow.	Se hawwe miskien net iens moarn.
They talk long.	Se prate lang.
And, if nothing else, you should love the name.	En, as neat oars, jo moatte fan 'e namme hâlde.
We do not need any of them.	Wy hawwe net ien fan har nedich.
She's gone.	Se is fuort.
They want to take their time.	Se wolle har tiid nimme.
It would have been good to do so.	It soe it goede west hawwe om te dwaan.
I will not even eat.	Ik sil net iens ite.
Nobody asked for it.	Nimmen frege der om.
It looked different.	It seach der oars út.
That's the new way.	Dat is de nije manier.
Must be pretty fun.	Moat aardich leuk wêze.
I still remember him talking to you.	Ik wit noch dat er mei dy praat.
Now she would never know why.	No soe se noait witte wêrom.
She thought she knew it.	Se tocht dat se it wist.
We talk two or three times a month.	Wy prate twa of trije kear yn 'e moanne.
We're gone.	Wy binne fuort.
But what do we know.	Mar wat witte wy.
You do not always get what you want.	Jo krije net altyd wat jo wolle.
There is no other way.	D'r is gjin oare manier.
The big one.	De grutte.
If she had, he might never have been away.	As se hie, hie er miskien noait fuort west.
I love everything you make.	Ik hâld fan alles wat jo meitsje.
The police found nothing.	De plysje fûn neat.
I wish it would happen.	Ik woe dat it barre soe.
You can get me, or not.	Jo kinne my krije, of net.
There is work to be done in the city.	Der is wurk te dwaan yn 'e stêd.
No one else can either.	Nimmen oars kin ek.
Woman when no one is looking.	Frou as gjinien sjocht.
He needs me.	Hy hat my nedich.
I do not even know how to get them.	Ik wit net iens hoe't ik se krije moat.
She then could not know what she had done.	Se koe dan net witte wat se dien hie.
That's all we can do.	Dat is alles wat wy kinne dwaan.
But nothing more than that.	Mar neat mear as dat.
Or a plan.	Of in plan.
You are welcome.	Graach dien.
It looks beautiful.	It sjocht der moai út.
He can hurt me.	Hy kin my sear dwaan.
Not that we get much.	Net dat wy in protte krije.
This house has it and more.	Dit hûs hat it en mear.
He seemed surprised to see me.	Hy like ferrast om my te sjen.
He said he had.	Hy sei dat hy hie.
We'll know soon enough.	Wy sille it gau genôch witte.
We are just back ourselves.	Wy binne krekt werom sels.
There is nothing to say that it could not.	Der is neat te sizzen dat it net koe.
And so will he.	En sa sil hy.
Help, like.	Helpen, liket.
I hope it happens soon.	Ik hoopje dat it gau bart.
Was it you ?.	Wie it dy?.
That's where we started.	Dat, dêr binne wy ​​mei begûn.
We can talk about it.	Wy kinne der oer prate.
It may be the last chance we will have.	It kin de lêste kâns wêze dy't wy sille hawwe.
I'm one of you.	Ik bin ien fan dy.
Again, nothing happened.	Dêr barde ek wer neat.
What did she look like.	Wat seach se der út.
So never say never !.	Sa nea sizze nea!.
Very very good.	Hiel hiel goed.
All this was too good for her, of course.	Dit alles wie har te goed, fansels.
See who they work for.	Sjoch foar wa't se wurkje.
If you do not, you will have a problem.	As jo ​​dat net dogge, dan hawwe jo in probleem.
Now he wondered why he thought it could.	No frege er him ôf wêrom't er tocht hie dat it koe.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.	Ferkeard, ferkeard, ferkeard.
It was so not true.	It wie sa net wier.
This can not be done by one man alone.	Dit kin net dien wurde troch ien man allinnich.
I've decided we should leave this weekend.	Ik haw besletten dat wy it wykein fuort moatte.
He does not speak so often.	Hy praat net sa faak.
They knew best.	Se wisten it bêste.
We always do this.	Wy dogge dit altyd.
You're my boy.	Do bist myn jonge.
Nothing seemed to scare him.	Neat like him bang te meitsjen.
Through the water.	Troch it wetter.
But you would like it.	Mar jo soene it leuk fine.
Even sure he will have a good read.	Sels wis dat hy in goed lêzen sil hawwe.
And then the whole school would know it.	En dan soe de hiele skoalle it witte.
In fact, she died last week.	Eins stoar se ferline wike.
He showed me.	Hy liet my sjen.
He has apparently been quite true to himself.	Hy hat nei alle gedachten frij wier oan himsels west.
Get out of my car!	Gean út myn auto!
You can do this work if you really try.	Jo kinne dit wurk dwaan as jo echt besykje.
I will never ask you to do something you are not ready for.	Ik sil jo noait freegje om wat te dwaan wêr't jo net klear foar binne.
I am, in a word, real.	Ik bin, yn in wurd, echt.
Just go and take care of it.	Gean gewoan en soargje der foar.
Mine can wait.	Myn kin wachtsje.
If you want it.	As jo ​​​​it wolle.
Maybe so.	Miskien wol.
For me, it was difficult.	Foar my wie it dreech.
He will not ask you again.	Hy sil dy net wer freegje.
You can not tell me where I live and where I should not live.	Jo kinne my net fertelle wêr't ik wenje en wêr't ik net wenje moat.
There is really only one person who can do this.	D'r is eins mar ien persoan dy't dit kin wêze.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Fertel my asjebleaft dat dit net is.
And then maybe she hopes she would not.	En dan hope se miskien dat se net soe.
Not just my work.	Net allinnich myn wurk.
She had done well with him.	Se hie it goed mei him hân.
What can be	Wat kin wêze
There is really nothing to do.	Der is echt neat te dwaan.
I knew nothing.	Ik wist neat.
She knows it of course.	Se wit it fansels.
Today,, there is enough money.	Hjoed, , der is genôch jild.
I see where you're coming up.	Ik sjoch wêr't jo op komme.
We were so wrong.	Wy wiene sa ferkeard.
With water and back to a day when the water was gone.	Mei wetter en werom nei in dei dat it wetter fuort wie.
Same with us.	Itselde mei ús.
And think about it.	En tink der oer.
Tell me what's going on.	Fertel my wat der bart.
It's time for people to do the right thing.	It is tiid foar minsken om it goede ding te dwaan.
You have to be very careful when working with them.	Jo moatte heul foarsichtich wêze as jo mei har wurkje.
He would.	Hy soe.
I see nothing.	Ik sjoch neat.
We set off.	Wy sette ôf.
It's not working, she said.	It giet net, sei se.
I never felt that again.	Dat fielde ik noait wer.
It's my job.	It is myn wurk.
I want to know everything about them.	Ik wol alles oer har witte.
I want her here.	Ik wol har hjir.
I'm happy for him.	Ik bin bliid foar him.
I just wanted a dog.	Ik woe gewoan in hûn.
I want nothing out of the house.	Ik wol neat út 'e hûs.
He thought on bed.	Hy tocht op bêd.
He does not need one.	Hy hat net ien nedich.
I had never been so scared in my life.	Ik wie noch noait sa bang yn myn libben.
He went in to take the job.	Hy gie yn om de baan oan te nimmen.
She did not look worried.	Se seach net soargen.
We have become friends.	Wy binne freonen wurden.
I have to go.	Ik moat fuort.
She must also have taken time off work.	Se moat ek frij fan it wurk nimme moatten hawwe.
Though he will not be.	Al sil er net wêze.
I do not want him to come.	Ik wol net dat er komt.
If there was one, she did not see it.	As der ien wiene, seach se se net.
There is enough for everyone.	Der is genôch foar elkenien.
And she would live with it.	En se soe der wol oan wenne.
It did well with him.	It die goed mei him.
You can do it with your kids.	Jo kinne it meitsje mei jo bern.
That's here to stay.	Dat is hjir om te bliuwen.
There was clearly more to see for me.	D'r wie dúdlik mear foar my te sjen.
Here it's for you, boy.	Hjir is foar dy, jonge.
Everything he does, he does well.	Alles wat er docht, docht er goed.
He's so old.	Hy is sa âld.
I think you should go to her one last time.	Ik tink dat jo in lêste kear nei har ta moatte.
I took her too.	Ik naam har ek.
She did not want anyone to know about her.	Se woe net dat elkenien fan har wist.
Your mother gave it to you.	Dyn mem joech it dy.
But that's not it.	Mar dat is it net.
She knew no one would believe it if she told her.	Se wist dat nimmen it soe leauwe as se har fertelde.
If he was not careful.	As er net foarsichtich wie.
Why did not you tell us about them?	Wêrom hawwe jo ús net oer har ferteld?
I have them.	Ik haw har.
But she does not.	Mar se docht net sa.
I still can.	Ik kin noch wol.
I love it so much.	Ik hâld der safolle fan.
Just a dog.	Krekt in hûn.
Someone better do something soon.	Immen better gau wat dwaan.
And so, but hard to get.	En sa, mar dreech te krijen.
But that was last year.	Mar dat wie ferline jier.
We arrived too late.	Wy binne te let kommen.
My boyfriend would not talk to you.	Myn keardel soe net mei dy prate.
Here was not there.	Hjir wie der net.
It was about everything.	It gie oer alles.
This thing needs to stop.	Dit ding moat ophâlde.
That was her job.	Dat wie har wurk.
It's a great opportunity for you.	It is in grutte kâns foar jo.
She will get better.	Se sil better wurde.
I will pay you back.	Ik sil dy werom betelje.
He made his way to class.	Hy makke syn wei nei de klasse.
They were very ready to leave.	Se wiene tige ree om fuort te gean.
She had not seen her for a long time.	Se hie har net lang sjoen.
Somehow the word always came to him.	Op ien of oare manier kaam it wurd altyd by him.
That's exactly how things are.	Dat is krekt hoe't dingen binne.
But that is not true.	Mar dat is net wier.
If you have not heard, they are really good.	As jo ​​​​net heard hawwe, binne se echt goed.
It is not just us who are afraid.	It binne net allinnich wy dy't bang binne.
Well, it seems to have worked.	No, it liket wurke te hawwen.
But it needs to be done !.	Mar it moat dien wurde!.
They would be more than willing to help.	Se soene mear as ree wêze om te helpen.
But it still does not matter.	Mar it makket noch altyd neat út.
And a lot if we can get it.	En in protte as wy it kinne krije.
If that was what you were worried about.	As dat wie wat jo soargen oer.
I do not really know.	Ik wit it net echt.
He had to get away from this thing.	Hy moast fan dit ding ôf.
Soon he could not.	Gau koe er net.
This movie does not.	Dizze film docht dat net.
Of course, they must have been wrong.	Fansels moatte se ferkeard west hawwe.
I was late.	Ik kaam te let.
But they are there.	Mar se binne der.
My wife will not be happy about that at all.	Dêr sil myn frou hielendal net bliid fan wêze.
I'm not trying.	Ik besykje it net.
You do not think about what you do.	Jo tinke net oer wat jo dogge.
I can not be sure.	Ik kin der net wis fan wêze.
Of course you have to try.	Fansels moatte jo besykje.
I can not find him in the house either.	Ik kin him ek net yn 'e hûs fine.
Many things are not working as well as they used to.	In protte dingen wurkje net sa goed as eartiids.
That he sat in there too.	Dat hy der ek yn siet.
I'll go if you want me to go.	Ik sil gean, as jo wolle dat ik gean.
You never do.	Jo nea dwaan.
But they are there as good as not now.	Mar se binne der no sa goed as net.
I want to be here.	Ik wol hjir wêze.
A city is not a city.	In stêd is gjin stêd.
They just made it.	Se hawwe it krekt makke.
It is not.	It is net.
And then we know what happened.	En dan witte wy wat der bard is.
It was not the right thing to do.	It wie net it goede ding om te dwaan.
I'm sorry you're going.	It spyt my dat jo geane.
What can she do differently.	Wat kin se oars.
She's wrong.	Se is ferkeard.
I do not know what he's done.	Ik wit net wêr't er oan dien is.
Still very sick.	Noch altyd tige siik.
I can say that.	Dat kin ik wol sizze.
That should not have happened either.	Dat hie ek net dwaan moatten.
If they did, they would probably win.	As se diene, soene se wierskynlik winne.
What you do matters.	Wat jo dogge makket ta.
They need to be here.	Se moatte hjir wêze.
I think they probably will.	Ik tink dat se wierskynlik sille.
She looks around but no one can see.	Se sjocht om har hinne, mar kin nimmen sjen.
You might be able to create a family.	Jo kinne miskien in famylje meitsje.
I have them, but not without much work.	Ik haw se, mar net sûnder folle wurk.
I wish you the best.	Ik wol dy it bêste winskje.
It had been difficult for everyone.	It hie foar elkenien dreech west.
Well, there is only one thing.	No, der is mar ien ding.
I would be nothing without it.	Ik soe neat wêze sûnder it.
The first way.	De earste manier.
She would not look at me.	Se soe net nei my sjen.
The truth still stands.	De wierheid stiet noch.
I need someone who can hold him these hours.	Ik haw ien nedich dy't him dizze oeren hâlde kin.
Then a dog.	Dan in hûn.
You even said she had problems.	Jo hawwe sels sein dat se problemen hat.
She does it very well.	Se docht it hiel goed.
I would love to help.	Ik soe graach helpe.
As someone said, he is not.	As immen sei, hy is net.
He wanted to make his mother happy.	Hy woe syn mem bliid meitsje.
Which he would not put into words.	Wat hy gjin wurden sette soe.
I wonder where she lives.	Ik freegje my ôf wêr't se wennet.
We do not have to do that here.	Dat hoege wy hjir net te dwaan.
But, you put me around the good people, Dad.	Mar, do sette my om 'e goede minsken, heit.
You're home.	Do bist thús.
That's exactly what they do.	Dat dogge se krekt.
See how you get it in this question.	Sjoch hoe't jo it krije yn dizze fraach.
I've never heard of it.	Ik haw it nea heard.
See her parents.	Sjoch har âlden.
And you will be better too.	En jo sille ek better wêze.
Let's say that.	Lit ús dat sizze.
Best you come with me.	It bêste dat jo mei my komme.
You may believe they are likely.	Jo kinne leauwe dat se wierskynlik binne.
But she is not ready for work.	Mar se is net ree foar it wurk.
I doubt that is the only one.	Ik twifelje oan dat dat de ienige is.
This is just enough.	Dit is krekt genôch.
It’s nice to look at things.	It is moai om nei dingen te sjen.
What a year.	Wat in jier.
I want him out of here.	Ik wol him hjir wei.
We love it was not.	Wy hâlde it wie net.
Let me know if you have any questions.	Lit my witte as jo fragen hawwe.
He must love her.	Hy moat fan har hâlde.
There are two things.	It binne twa dingen.
This is just not how it works.	Dit is gewoan net hoe't it wurket.
This does not work.	Dit wurket net.
I can agree with that.	Dêr kin ik it wol mei iens wêze.
They have a little money.	Se hawwe in bytsje jild.
This can take time.	Dizze kin tiid dwaan.
That's it, more or less.	Dat is it, min of mear.
But other people will not.	Mar oare minsken sille net.
He eats almost everything.	Hy yt hast alles.
Go away from us.	Gean by ús wei.
You can not see him.	Jo kinne him net sjen.
This was a little different.	Dit wie in bytsje oars.
I actually felt different.	Ik fielde my eins oars.
He touched my hand.	Hy rekke myn hân oan.
I agree with him.	Ik bin it mei him iens.
Everything else is as before.	Al it oare is as earder.
The woman went on to eat.	De frou gie troch nei it iten.
Over in my life.	Oer yn myn libben.
We have become better.	Wy binne better wurden.
I told her this last time.	Ik fertelde har dit lêste kear.
For them, they were all good in their lives.	Foar har wiene se alles goed yn har libben.
Tomorrow there is much more to see.	Moarn is der noch folle mear te sjen.
He said he would take care of it.	Hy sei dat er der wol foar soargje soe.
We are very.	Wy binne tige.
So it's as long as you go the right way.	Sa is it sa lang as jo op 'e goede manier gean.
But she could not say that now.	Mar dat koe se no net sizze.
Maybe he did.	Miskien hat er it dien.
He wanted to see.	Hy woe sjen.
He no longer knew what he was.	Hy wist net mear wat er wie.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.	Wy prate der moarn oer.
Why, we can do anything.	Wêrom, wy kinne alles dwaan.
That will happen, that will happen.	Dat sil barre, dat sil barre.
They will not give it to us.	Se sille it ús net jaan.
Those are things that people want.	Dat binne dingen dy't minsken wolle.
Which, it's hard to say.	Hokker, it is dreech te sizzen.
He makes a living from it.	Hy makket der in libben fan.
If there is now.	As der no is.
Rather, you should just try to find them yourself.	Earder moatte jo gewoan besykje se sels te finen.
But it was not just him.	Mar it wie net allinnich hy.
Only it never really happened.	Allinnich is it noait echt bard.
The money was good just to have.	It jild wie goed gewoan te hawwen.
Everyone talked about it, but no one did anything.	Elkenien hie it der oer, mar nimmen die wat.
I have tried it.	Ik ha it besocht.
He saw, but did not want to tell her.	Hy seach, mar woe it har net fertelle.
No way was he talking to anyone.	Gjin manier wie er prate mei immen.
Now we'll give them one.	No sille wy se ien jaan.
Easy.	Maklik.
It was something we really cared about.	It wie wat wy echt soargen oer.
I did not think so.	Dat tocht ik net.
You know how that was.	Jo witte hoe't dat wie.
But there is hope.	Mar der is hope.
We just scared it.	Wy bang it gewoan.
That girl there is really beautiful.	Dat famke dêr is echt moai.
Maybe he was.	Miskien wie hy.
You say it, it must be so.	Jo sizze it, it moat sa wêze.
They had begun.	Se wiene begûn.
That's what you need to do.	Dat moatte jo dwaan.
So it should not happen.	Sa moat it net barre.
Where is mine wrong.	Wêr is myn ferkeard.
I could show it to her.	Ik koe it har sjen litte.
And so we did.	En sa diene wy.
Let's go back.	Litte wy werom gean.
I had just asked her something.	Ik hie har krekt wat frege.
I think that's the problem with us.	Ik tink dat dat it probleem is mei ús.
But you are not an animal.	Mar do bist gjin bist.
But it had not yet come.	Mar it wie noch net kommen.
It's what we do.	It is wat wy dogge út.
I'm very worried about him.	Ik bin tige soargen oer him.
But we will be there for them.	Mar wy sille der foar har wêze.
I can not let that happen again.	Ik kin dat net wer barre litte.
I went to the people.	Ik gie nei de minsken.
Of course there is a large lake.	Fansels is der in grutte mar.
You stay there.	Jo bliuwe dêr.
We can be better than that.	Wy kinne better wêze as dat.
I was scared too.	Ik wie ek bang.
She wished it was true.	Se woe dat it wier wie.
One, he works hard pretty all the time.	Ien, hy wurket hurd moai de hiele tiid.
He would come tomorrow.	Hy soe moarn komme.
I know you're there.	Ik wit do bist der.
That is why we do what we do.	Dat is wêrom wy dogge wat wy dogge.
Your father asked you.	Jo heit frege dy.
I should have come back here myself.	Ik hie hjir sels werom komme moatten.
Here it is!	Hjir is it!
And he was my father too.	En hy wie myn heit ek.
We have been working on this kind of thing for over two years.	Wy wurkje al mear as twa jier oan dit soarte dingen.
What he said.	Wat hy sei.
He began to say something.	Hy begûn wat te sizzen.
I had never said that.	Dat hie ik nea sein.
He had never been sick in his life.	Hy hie yn syn libben nea siik west.
Please, come on.	Asjebleaft, kom op.
I told him.	Ik sei him.
Not everyone in the family felt that way.	Net elkenien yn 'e famylje fielde dat sa.
Mom, make up your hair.	Mem, meitsje dyn hier op.
That makes you sure to go around there !.	Dat makket jo der wis fan om dêr hinne te gean!.
She is very beautiful.	Se is hiel moai.
Wherever we go.	Wêr't wy hinne geane.
He will see you for himself.	Hy sil dy sels sjen.
She could be anyone.	Se koe elkenien wêze.
I thought you knew that too.	Ik tocht dat jo dat ek wisten.
It was always nice to see him.	It wie altyd leuk om him te sjen.
It seemed like the best idea.	It like it bêste idee.
But that, of course, is not possible.	Mar dat kin fansels net.
It's probably there too.	It is der wierskynlik ek.
Just never again.	Krekt nea wer.
Maybe they do.	Miskien dogge se.
Let me look at you.	Lit my nei dy sjen.
And we'll get you next year.	En wy krije jo takom jier.
If there is nothing else.	As der neat oars is.
I'm going on with some work.	Ik gean oan mei wat wurk.
My friend is here.	Myn freon is hjir.
This was my last year at school.	Dit wie myn lêste jier op skoalle.
He tried to help her.	Hy besocht har te helpen.
Well, almost everything.	No, hast alles.
I could not speak.	Ik koe net prate.
You know we used to be friends.	Jo witte dat wy eartiids freonen wiene.
If you come around.	As jo ​​komme om.
A young woman was with him.	In jonge frou wie by him.
She did not go in there.	Se gie der net yn.
She told us she had not eaten for days.	Se fertelde ús dat se al dagen neat iten hie.
My mother is still here.	Myn mem is hjir noch.
She would help him and he would help her.	Se soe him helpe en hy soe har helpe.
But they did nothing.	Mar se hawwe neat dien.
They are very different, actually.	Se binne hiel oars, eins.
I'll tell him you're not here.	Ik sil him sizze datsto hjir net bist.
I see the problem.	Ik sjoch it probleem.
It's just not there.	It is der gewoan net.
Not good, maybe.	Net goed, miskien.
But we must not.	Mar wy moatte net.
I thought you could tell me not to go.	Ik tocht dat jo my sizze kinne net te gean.
You must do everything you can to help me.	Jo moatte alles dwaan wat jo kinne om my te helpen.
Since that time he had no one else in his life.	Sûnt dy tiid hie hy gjinien mear yn syn libben.
He said she liked that better.	Hy sei dat se dat better mocht.
Do not look at me like that.	Sjoch my net sa oan.
Glad it still holds.	Bliid dat it noch hâldt.
It found his beast.	It fûn syn bist.
I know.	Wit ik.
It's now or never !.	It is no of nea!.
But then it will never be the same again.	Mar dan sil it noait wer itselde wêze.
This is what I was told.	Dit is wat my ferteld is.
He is careful.	Hy is foarsichtich.
She got it.	Se krige dit.
Nothing more than that, for now.	Neat mear as dat, foar no.
She knows nothing, it seems.	Se wit neat, liket it.
We're not going back.	Wy geane net werom.
She told us to get ready.	Se fertelde ús om klear te meitsjen.
And will happen in a week.	En sil barre yn 'e wike.
She never had a job.	Se hie nea in baan.
I wanted to go home with her.	Ik woe mei har nei hûs gean.
Talk to the good people.	Prate mei de goede minsken.
There's where you are, the truth comes out.	Dêr is wêr't jo, de wierheid komt út.
That happens so often.	Dat bart sa faak.
Just try if you have to.	Gewoan besykje as jo moatte.
Just a little.	Mar in bytsje.
Even they believe they are.	Sels se leauwe dat se binne.
It had not happened.	It wie net bard.
Go to work for him.	Gean foar him oan it wurk.
You're here now.	Do bist hjir no.
His mother did not have to worry.	Syn mem hoegde gjin soargen te hawwen.
I'm not dating anyone.	Ik gean mei gjinien út.
I'm waiting with her.	Ik wachtsje mei har.
No one has.	Gjinien hat.
We know we'll get over it.	Wy witte dat wy der oer komme sille.
It does not matter to me.	It komt my net út.
And it was through me.	En it wie troch my.
And we do not need any problems.	En wy hawwe gjin problemen nedich.
I do not have a car.	Ik haw gjin auto.
I'll be here two hours.	Ik sil hjir twa oeren wêze.
This is your problem.	Dit is dyn probleem.
If you can not find it, you can find it here.	As jo ​​​​it net kinne fine, kinne jo it hjir fine.
I just do not know what to say.	Ik wit gewoan net wat ik sizze moat.
Never really made the time.	Nea echt de tiid makke.
This was no way.	Dit wie gjin wei.
There it was again, she thought.	Dêr wie it wer, tocht se.
How do we deal with this problem?	Hoe geane wy ​​mei dit probleem om?
Have you ever been to this place?	Ha jo ea west op dit plak?
It is different than in the past.	It is oars as yn it ferline.
So they just put it away.	Dat se sette it mar fuort.
But it can actually.	Mar it kin eins.
They were good too.	Se wiene ek goed.
I'll tell you when.	Ik sil dy fertelle wannear.
I'll make the bed ready.	Ik sil it bêd klear meitsje.
Nothing else happened, really.	Der barde neat oars, echt.
He has come in a lot for him.	Hy hat in protte foar him kommen yn.
Time for bed!	Tiid foar bêd!
But she will say nothing to help me.	Mar se sil neat sizze om my te helpen.
All life is that.	Al it libben is dat.
My life has just begun.	Myn libben is krekt begûn.
He asked her not to leave.	Hy frege har net fuort te gean.
She still has it.	Se hat it noch.
It looks really good.	It sjocht der echt goed út.
Even though.	Sels.
Maybe, a little.	Miskien, in bytsje.
Or he might not have.	Of hy mocht net hawwe.
I assume you can say it that way.	Ik nim oan dat jo it sa sizze kinne.
You're not even my friend, for the same reason.	Do bist net iens myn freon, om deselde reden.
I think we will agree.	Ik tink dat wy it iens sille.
Freon.	Freon.
I told him that too.	Dat sei ik him ek.
But here he had never thought of.	Mar hjir hie er nea oan tocht.
I do not ask much.	Ik freegje net folle.
That was so clear.	Dat wie sa dúdlik.
You need to talk to them.	Jo moatte mei har prate.
Why not?' 	Wêrom net?'
said her husband.	sei har man.
I did not tell him much.	Ik sei him net folle.
We just have to be on it.	Wy moatte der gewoan op wêze.
I gave it my all.	Ik joech it alles.
And that's what it's about.	En dêr giet it om.
After a week, no one had seen or heard from him.	Nei in wike hie nimmen fan him sjoen of heard.
We must too.	Wy moatte ek.
I was angry at her.	Ik wie lilk op har.
Together they could make something of it.	Tegearre koene se der wat fan meitsje.
It's going well.	It komt goed.
She was sick.	Se wie siik.
There was no one else around.	D'r wie nimmen oars om.
We do not know how it happened.	Wy witte net hoe't it bard is.
I did my job and he did his.	Ik die myn wurk en hy die syn.
And everything works just fine.	En alles wurket gewoan goed.
This is exactly the time and place.	Dit is krekt de tiid en it plak.
You are not a person who would ever hurt another person.	Jo binne gjin persoan dy't oait in oare persoan sear dwaan soe.
But if a man can, he will.	Mar as in man kin, dan sil hy.
He could not help.	Hy koe net helpe.
Man, you were probably there.	Man, jo wiene der wierskynlik.
You do that a lot these days.	Dat dogge jo dizze dagen in protte.
I'm still there.	Ik bin der noch.
We can wait so long.	Wy kinne sa lang wachtsje.
Works for me.	Wurket foar my.
She looked so surprised.	Se seach sa ferrast.
There was a party.	Dêr wie in feest.
And it was so done.	En it wie sa dien.
At work.	Oan it wurk.
First, we got better.	Earst binne wy ​​better wurden.
Now look what they did to him.	Sjoch no wat se him dien hawwe.
Well, nothing else.	No, neat oars.
But what we need to do is try.	Mar wat moatte wy dwaan is besykje.
We do not like it.	Wy hâlde it net.
You have been very good!	Do bist hiel goed west!
And you did not know it.	En do wist it net.
He was clearly surprised by what had happened.	Hy wie dúdlik ferrast troch wat der bard wie.
That's what happened here.	Dat is hjir bard.
He is with his mother.	Hy is by syn mem.
He felt it too.	Hy fielde it ek.
I did not want you to be angry with him.	Ik woe net dat jo lilk op him wiene.
I really hope to come back one day.	Ik hoopje echt op in dei werom te kommen.
Someone has to get in there.	Immen moat der yn.
That clearly will not happen.	Dat sil dúdlik net barre.
Well done, man.	Goed dien, man.
I did not want to see anyone.	Ik woe net ien sjen.
They also did not get much.	Se krigen ek net folle.
But he could not help it.	Mar hy koe it net helpe.
Maybe they knew it themselves though.	Miskien wisten se it sels wol.
He just hurt me now.	Hy die my no net sear.
Not sure what happened, of course.	Net wis wat der bard is, fansels.
I would like to know what happens.	Ik wol graach witte wat der bart.
The best of the best this weekend.	It bêste fan it bêste dit wykein.
They just will not believe they are wrong.	Se sille gewoan net leauwe dat se ferkeard binne.
He liked to be with her.	Hy mocht graach by har wêze.
I'm a mother.	Ik bin mem.
Let me talk to him.	Lit my mei him prate.
They pay me for this.	Se betelje my foar dit.
I would like to know why.	Ik soe graach witte wêrom.
Will make again.	Sil wer meitsje.
I did not hear what he said.	Ik hearde net wat er sei.
And good for me.	En goed foar my.
I work here.	Ik wurkje hjir.
No one can find us here.	Nimmen kin ús hjir fine.
Maybe he should have.	Miskien hie er moatten.
One last question.	Ien lêste fraach.
This past week.	Dizze lêste wike.
You just have to ask him.	Jo moatte him mar freegje.
People would say they would give you everything, but they would never.	Minsken soene sizze dat se jo alles jaan soene, mar se soene noait.
Not again.	Net wer.
I doubt you would.	Ik twifelje dat jo soene.
That kind of thing happens.	Dat soarte ding bart.
He hit something hard.	Hy rekke wat hurd.
It was not fun at all.	It wie hielendal net leuk.
She says she got it from her mother.	Se seit dat se se fan har mem krigen hat.
You will find that they want to do it.	Jo sille fine dat se it wolle dwaan.
It's gone, just gone.	It is fuort, gewoan fuort.
I knew he was not good.	Ik wist dat er net goed wie.
I must have been wrong.	Ik moast ferkeard wêze.
It's easy.	It is maklik.
It's the next big thing.	It is it folgjende grutte ding.
You are completely wrong.	Jo binne hielendal ferkeard.
I did not have that.	Dat hie ik net.
And that was wrong too.	En dat wie ek ferkeard.
And there's a lot of truth in that.	En dêr sit in protte wierheid yn.
And they will make beautiful whatever you want.	En se sille moai meitsje wat jo wolle.
It worked for me.	It wurke foar my.
In her house but not in her bed.	Yn har hûs mar net yn har bêd.
I saw no one.	Ik seach gjinien.
She was a good time girl.	Se wie in goede tiid famke.
Everyone is there for the good reason.	Elkenien is der foar de goede reden.
They had me in a pretty bad place.	Se hiene my op in aardich min plak.
Twice he let her know she was free to leave.	Twa kear liet er har witte dat se frij wie om fuort te gean.
I also do other things every now and then.	Ik meitsje ek sa no en dan oare dingen.
It stands for reason.	It stiet foar reden.
I was very happy with that.	Ik wie tige bliid dat.
We have time.	Wy hawwe tiid.
In other words, it's what it is.	Mei oare wurden, it is wat it is.
Now it's her life.	No is it har libben.
I'm not good at it.	Ik bin der net sa goed yn.
They have enough.	Se hawwe genôch.
She quickly made up the room.	Se makke gau de keamer op.
I'm going to bed again.	Ik gean wer op bêd.
I love movies.	Ik hâld fan film.
I've never even seen them.	Ik haw se sels noait sjoen.
It can be done well and it can be done easily.	It kin goed dien wurde en it kin maklik oer dien wurde.
People know who you are.	Minsken witte wa't jo binne.
The truth was she could, but she did not want to.	De wierheid wie dat se koe, mar se woe net.
He was the only guy.	Hy wie de ienige keardel.
This was something else that had happened two years ago.	Dit wie wat oars dat twa jier lyn bard wie.
I see you there.	Ik sjoch dy dêr.
People here say.	Minsken hjir sizze.
She would not show up for me.	Se soe net foar my sjen litte.
You're not such a woman.	Do bist net sa'n frou.
He did not hear her.	Hy hearde har net.
I can not leave you well now.	Ik kin dy no net goed litte.
I'm old enough to be your father.	Ik bin âld genôch om dyn heit te wêzen.
If they do not, well.	As se dat net dogge, goed.
He wore one that day.	Hy hie dy dei ien oan.
He was never tried.	Hy waard nea besocht.
That was three days ago.	Dat wie trije dagen lyn.
It's hard work.	It is hurd wurk.
Well, look at her hair.	No, sjoch nei har hier.
But it does not.	Mar it docht net.
She took her time.	Se naam har tiid.
She works hard every day.	Se wurket alle dagen hurd.
We did not do much work yesterday.	Wy hawwe juster net folle wurk dien.
It does not matter if you.	It makket neat út as jo.
Just do not do it.	Doch it gewoan net.
I never got the chance to tell him.	Ik haw noait de kâns krigen om him te fertellen.
That's what you told us.	Dat hawwe jo ús sein.
The man said nothing.	De man sei neat.
It would be something else.	It soe wat oars wurde.
Not in a good or bad way.	Net op in goede of minne manier.
Not as good as you think.	Net sa goed as jo tinke.
It occurred to me, of course.	It kaam my fansels.
And nothing goes on.	En neat giet oan.
I saw that it was too late.	Ik seach dat it te let wie.
Neither do you.	Jo ek net.
I try things on for size.	Ik besykje dingen op foar grutte.
And now is the time.	En no is de tiid.
We had no money.	Wy hiene gjin jild.
You have to do this yourself.	Dit moatte jo sels dwaan.
One thing is for sure.	Ien ding is wis.
I never wanted what happened to your family.	Ik woe noait wat der mei jo famylje barde.
What place is it?	Hokker plak is dit?
She had seen him once a long time ago.	Se hie him lang lyn ien kear sjoen.
You wait and see.	Jo wachtsje en sjoch.
We had no more food.	Wy hiene gjin iten mear.
Come in.	Kom der yn.
Not soon enough.	Net gau genôch.
Which would be nice.	Wat soe moai wêze.
And then you.	En dan dy.
I don't like.	Ik hâld net fan.
They have been there for over a year.	Se binne der al mear as in jier mei.
Have you seen what she just did?	Hawwe jo sjoen wat se krekt dien hat?
He has seen it too.	Hy hat it ek sjoen.
He does his job and does it well.	Hy docht syn wurk en docht it goed.
That makes me much better.	Dat makket my folle better.
Nothing much else here now.	Neat folle oars hjir no.
It just wasn’t enough.	It wie gewoan net genôch.
That time is back.	Dy tiid is werom.
I did it myself.	Ik haw it sels dien.
I should never have let it happen.	Ik hie it noait barre moatte litte.
It felt old.	It fielde âld.
You must be tired.	Jo moatte wurch wêze.
I want a man.	Ik wol in man.
Even he looked scared.	Sels seach er bang.
I just wanted to come to her house.	Ik woe gewoan by har thús komme.
I would not be able to find a job.	Ik soe gjin baan fine kinne.
Maybe they can do a better job than us.	Miskien kinne se in better wurk dwaan as wy.
It was even better.	It wie noch better.
I walked away from him once.	Ik rûn ien kear by him wei.
Of one thing she was sure.	Fan ien ding wie se wis.
I wish the child well.	Ik winskje it bern goed.
He did not run this time.	Hy rûn dizze kear net.
It's just itself.	It is gewoan himsels.
I really got out of it.	Ik bin der echt fan kommen.
Help me here now.	Help my no hjir.
A woman comes out to talk to me.	In frou komt út om mei my te praten.
There is only one.	Der is mar ien.
I do not know why, it's just.	Ik wit net wêrom, it is gewoan.
I did not want it to stop.	Ik woe net dat it ophâlde.
Let me know if you need more.	Lit my witte as jo mear nedich binne.
Worked for me.	Wurke foar my.
That will not happen here.	Dat sil hjir net barre.
It's still very hard.	It is noch hiel hurd.
getting angry will not do any good.	lilk wurde sil gjin goed dwaan.
But she needed someone to do it for her.	Mar se hie ien nedich om har it te dwaan.
We should do it with two.	Wy soene it mei twa dwaan moatte.
I've had it.	Ik haw it hân.
I think otherwise.	Ik tink oars.
Look at this.	Sjoch nei dit.
But he did not run.	Mar hy rûn net.
Never never never.	Nea nea nea.
It just would not happen.	It soe gewoan net barre.
He would do many things today.	Hy soe hjoed in protte dingen dwaan.
We'll see if they work.	Wy sille sjen oft se wurkje.
And eat with other people.	En ite mei oare minsken.
You'll never find him there.	Jo sille him dêr noait fine.
The couple took it and walked along.	It pear naam it en rûn mei.
They just have to keep another day.	Se moatte mar in oare dei hâlde.
And let it go.	En lit it gean.
I still see no reason to give it up.	Ik sjoch noch gjin reden om it op te jaan.
You have to come.	Jo moatte komme.
Her name says it all.	Har namme seit it allegear.
There may be another way.	Der kin noch in manier wêze.
They both knew how much he did.	Se wisten beide hoefolle hy die.
Just what he needed.	Krekt wat er nedich hie.
You will never stop.	Jo sille nea ophâlde.
But you.	Mar dy.
He may not agree with it.	Hy mei der net mei iens wêze.
There were three people in the room.	Der wiene trije minsken yn 'e keamer.
She never thought there was anyone among them.	Se tocht noait dat der ien ûnder har wie.
He was not surprised.	Hy wie net ferrast.
They are just the thing.	Se binne krekt it ding.
Maybe something's going on.	Miskien komt der wat op.
I waited a bit.	Ik wachte in bytsje.
Which is one that no one likes.	Wat is ien dy't nimmen leuk hat.
He was hoping for more.	Hy hie op mear hope.
It must be you.	It moat dy wêze.
I'm leaving.	Ik gean fuort.
Say he knows you and you will help him.	Seit dat hy jo ken en jo sille him helpe.
That's why he does this.	It is wêrom hy dit docht.
He was sure no one thought so.	Hy wie der wis fan dat nimmen dat tocht.
But it's so hard for me.	Mar it is sa dreech foar my.
That's one way to see it.	Dat is ien manier om it te sjen.
I found the house easily.	Ik fûn it hûs maklik.
She looks and looks so good.	Se liket en sjocht sa goed.
Or it could have stopped last night.	Of it koe fannacht ophâlde.
That's what you need.	Dat is wat jo nedich hawwe.
He would show everyone.	Hy soe elkenien sjen litte.
I want to know what happened.	Ik wol witte wat der bard is.
I needed my husband.	Ik hie myn man nedich.
But he was a good dog.	Mar hy wie in goede hûn.
I remember those from before.	Ik tink oan dy fan earder.
He needs to get up early.	Hy moat betiid op.
Where will she go now.	Wêr sil se no hinne.
Get there as soon as you can.	Kom der sa gau as jo kinne.
That was what he had eaten.	Dat hie er iten.
I would talk.	Ik soe prate.
This you can do.	Dit kinne jo dwaan.
He knew people loved him.	Hy wist dat minsken fan him hâlde.
Well, he says one day the city will be under water.	No, hy seit op in dei dat de stêd ûnder wetter sil wêze.
I want someone who would help me.	Ik wol ien dy't my soe helpe.
She should just make the best of it.	Se soe der mar it bêste fan meitsje moatte.
He looked better last night.	Hy seach der fannacht better út.
Just go away.	Gean mar fuort.
You do not have to do everything yourself.	Jo moatte net alles sels dwaan.
Of course, nothing happened.	Der barde fansels neat.
I have no idea what's going on.	Ik ha gjin idee wat der bart.
It was obviously too long.	It wie fansels al te lang.
There was nothing else to say.	Der wie neat oars te sizzen.
I'm sure he'll be here very soon.	Ik bin der wis fan dat er hjir hiel gau wêze sil.
By the time he went to bed.	Tsjin 'e tiid dat er op bêd gie.
One is obviously a really bad job.	Ien is fansels in echt min wurk.
Even people do.	Sels minsken dogge.
We have children.	Wy hawwe bern.
That thing will not help him.	Dat ding sil him net helpe.
We can not leave.	Wy kinne net fuort.
One thing was for sure.	Ien ding wie wis.
So it goes on.	Sa giet it troch.
You're really not bad at this.	Jo binne hjir echt net min yn.
Said it nicely before.	Sei it eartiids moai.
That should be able to see a child.	Dat moat in bern sjen kinne.
She just knows it.	Se wit it gewoan.
She looked nice.	Se seach der aardich út.
It's never easy.	It is nea maklik.
This place is something different.	Dit plak is wat oars.
But he had many friends.	Mar hy hie in protte freonen.
Come on, boy.	Kom op, jonge.
He started driving.	Hy begûn te riden.
I am that.	Ik bin dat.
But that was not very likely.	Mar dat wie net heul wierskynlik.
That is not true.	Dat is net wier.
I would be ready to help.	Ik soe ree wêze om te helpen.
I can not believe he would hurt her.	Ik kin net leauwe dat er har sear dwaan soe.
He does not want to talk.	Hy wol net prate.
They love me and need me.	Se hâlde fan my en hawwe my nedich.
You do not have to tell me.	Jo hoege it my net te fertellen.
The man who must.	De man dy't moat.
It made him a child again.	It makke him wer in bern.
She needed money.	Se hie jild nedich.
And we need everything we can get.	En wy hawwe alles nedich dat wy kinne krije.
Get there, but not yet.	Dêr komme, mar der noch net.
I have a few days off this week.	Ik ha dizze wike in pear dagen frij.
Are you going to buy a new moon?	Sille jo nije moanne keapje?
I wondered who he was.	Ik frege my ôf wa't hy wie.
He only has me.	Hy hat allinnich my.
A little more.	In bytsje mear.
If you have time.	As jo ​​​​tiid hawwe.
She was very scared of the dog.	Se wie tige bang foar de hûn.
It's getting tough.	It wurdt dreech.
I do not really know her.	Ik ken har net echt.
They can do whatever they want.	Se kinne dwaan wat se wolle.
He was really very old.	Hy wie echt hiel âld.
But it looks good.	Mar it sjocht der goed út.
They would find space for everyone.	Se soene plak fine foar elkenien.
She walked to work every day.	Se rûn alle dagen nei it wurk.
How do we really know what is true?	Hoe witte wy echt wat wier is?
The parents are the same.	De âlden binne itselde.
That was thirty years ago.	Dat wie tritich jier lyn.
I just did not know what to make of it.	Ik wist gewoan net wat ik der fan meitsje moast.
You have to help us.	Jo moatte ús helpe.
To do that well takes time.	Om dat goed te dwaan hat tiid.
It was really, really hard.	It wie echt, echt dreech.
He could keep it with him in his room.	Hy koe it by him yn syn keamer hâlde.
But do it right.	Mar doch it goed.
Children come and go.	Bern komme en gean.
She seemed to be talking to him.	Se like tsjin him te praten.
She told me it was my house.	Se fertelde my dat it hûs fan my wie.
Maybe it would be better if they did.	Miskien soe it better wêze as se dat dogge.
Not much, maybe.	Net folle, miskien.
That they can do whatever they want.	Dat se kinne dwaan wat se wolle.
Are you sure that was enough?	Binne jo wis dat dat genôch wie?
It did well with her.	It die goed mei har.
But they have to stop.	Mar se moatte ophâlde.
So it was so.	Sa wie it sa.
He asked once more if it was necessary.	Hy frege noch ien kear oft it nedich wie.
Try and play out what could happen.	Besykje en spylje út wat koe barre.
It's just the girl.	It is allinnich it famke.
Come on, tell me more.	Kom op, fertel my mear.
That's what we need.	Dat is wat wy nedich hawwe.
Maybe he is with her someone who can do anything.	Miskien is er mei har ien dy't alles kin.
Worked out well for everyone.	Wurke goed út foar elkenien.
Nobody can take that from us, nobody.	Nimmen kin dat fan ús nimme, nimmen.
I do not want to know what happened that weekend.	Ik wol net witte wat der dat wykein bard is.
What a place it is.	Wat in plak is dit.
That's what happened.	Dat is wat bard.
He hoped the water did not.	Hy hope dat it wetter it net die.
And it works very well.	En it wurket hiel goed.
I did not want to ask.	Ik woe net freegje.
Now more than ever.	No mear as ea.
Clearly there is work to be done here.	Dúdlik is hjir wurk te dwaan.
Is not it beautiful.	Is it net moai.
People want to help.	Minsken wolle helpe.
It's good to see you.	It is goed om dy te sjen.
I no longer know why.	Ik wit net mear wêrom.
The first could not find any words.	De earste koe gjin wurden fine.
Give me a chance.	Jou my in kâns.
It has to be what people will pay for.	It moat wêze wat minsken sille betelje foar.
We had never been out of town.	Wy wiene noait de stêd út west.
But now it's done.	Mar no is it dien.
But if you do, you'll be glad you did !.	Mar as jo dat dogge, sille jo bliid wêze dat jo dien hawwe!.
I do not know if she ever realized that.	Ik wit net oft se dat oait realisearre hat.
How you do it is up to you.	Hoe't jo it dogge is oan jo.
I really want her to be surprised.	Ik wol echt dat se ferrast wurdt.
She did not look angry anymore.	Se seach der net mear lilk út.
This will not be difficult for me.	Dit sil my net dreech wêze.
Almost no one can.	Hast gjinien kin.
Hope people like it.	Hoopje dat minsken it leuk fine.
She did wrong, not me.	Se die ferkeard, net ik.
And so it had.	En sa hie it.
The house is still standing.	It hûs stiet noch.
This could not really happen.	Dit koe net echt barre.
But he knew she did.	Mar hy wist dat se it die.
Probably good for me in a way.	Wierskynlik goed foar my op in manier.
He would get her free.	Hy soe har frij krije.
I will not do that.	Dat sil ik net dwaan.
Or the children.	Of de bern.
I've never met her.	Ik haw har nea moete.
Who are.	Wa binne.
Things will happen there.	Der sil dingen barre.
He was from earlier in the house.	Hy wie fan earder yn it hûs.
And she says.	En se seit.
Do not think about anything else.	Tink net oer wat oars.
Look forward to it.	Sjoch dêr nei út.
Very much so.	Hiel folle sa.
I just look at things differently.	Ik sjoch gewoan wat oars nei de dingen.
I had no idea how to do it today.	Ik hie gjin idee hoe't ik it hjoed dwaan moast.
They just make things up.	Se meitsje gewoan dingen op.
He does not know where you are going.	Hy wit net wêr't jo hinne geane.
Now he was much more than that.	No wie er folle mear as dat.
Sit her here.	Sit har hjir.
He has to get rid of it.	Hy moat der wol fan ôf.
Of course, he would.	Fansels, hy soe.
At first he could see nothing.	Earst koe er neat sjen.
Getting angry is one of them.	Lilk wurde is ien fan har.
I know them well.	Ik ken se goed.
We had no idea what he was doing.	Wy hiene gjin idee wat hy die.
He was old enough to ride	Hy wie âld genôch om te riden
All about the dog.	Alles oer de hûn.
Can we do this ?.	Kinne wy ​​dit dwaan?.
You could not get there by bike, bus or car.	Jo koene der net mei de fyts, bus of auto komme.
We know these things are true.	Wy witte dat dizze dingen wier binne.
He must have them.	Hy moat har hawwe.
Now he was gone.	No wie er fuort.
The only problem was getting them there.	It ienige probleem wie om se dêr te krijen.
A man could help but she was not sure.	In man koe helpe mar se wie der net wis fan.
But not much is expected of me.	Mar der wurdt net folle fan my ferwachte.
She could not believe it was happening.	Se koe net leauwe dat it bart.
You know why that was.	Jo witte wêrom dat wie.
You may not even know it's there.	Jo kinne net iens witte dat it der is.
And that does not stop there.	En dêr hâldt it net op.
The question is whether they want you here.	De fraach is oft se dy hjir wolle.
We would never do that now.	Dat soene wy ​​no noait dwaan.
It's the good thing.	It is it goede ding.
You want my help.	Jo wolle myn help.
It seemed to be.	It like te wêzen.
And everything works.	En alles wurket.
Everyone has them.	Elkenien hat har.
The water is bad.	It wetter is min.
He would probably tell his father or his friends.	Hy soe wierskynlik syn heit of syn freonen fertelle.
There are still people who believe it.	Der binne noch minsken dy't it leauwe.
He does not know where you live.	Hy wit net wêr't jo wenje.
That's not how it should be.	Sa moat it net.
She knew how to do it.	Se wist hoe't se it dwaan moast.
One or two can stay.	Ien of twa kinne bliuwe.
You have been very kind to me, said the old man.	Do hast my tige aardich west, sei de âld man.
Let's get him.	Litte wy him krije.
I just know she's coming here.	Ik wit gewoan dat se hjir komt.
I asked him if he had ever seen it.	Ik frege him oft er it oait sjoen hie.
There is no one in the car.	Der sit gjinien yn de auto.
Now he can know that his mother is gone.	No kin er witte dat syn mem fuort is.
It was what he expected.	It wie wat er ferwachte.
It's not much, he thought.	It is net folle, tocht er.
The other work is done by his children.	It oare wurk wurdt dien troch syn bern.
I have every reason to love you.	Ik haw alle reden om fan dy te hâlden.
I see this all the time.	Ik sjoch dit de hiele tiid.
The same is true today.	Itselde is wier hjoed.
I know I am not.	Ik wit dat ik net bin.
He the he he the.	Hy die wat hy die.
I'm sorry you can not see it.	It spyt my dat jo it net sjen kinne.
Let's see what happens.	Litte wy sjen wat der bart.
Didn't know much about it but knew it was nothing.	Wist der net folle fan mar wist dat it net neat wie.
They will not even know she is there.	Se sille net iens witte dat se der is.
That's fine with us.	Dat is goed mei ús.
She now looked like another person.	Se like no in oare persoan.
Not in words.	Net yn wurden.
It's about them.	It giet oer har.
He wanted to tell her she was wrong.	Hy woe har fertelle dat se ferkeard wie.
She asked me something.	Se frege my wat.
You knew what to do.	Do wist wat te dwaan.
He would come out of that house.	Hy soe út dat hûs komme.
Both were wrong, but they agreed.	Beide wiene ferkeard, mar se wiene it iens.
You're in your house now.	Jo binne no yn jo hûs.
He was a whole friend of mine.	Hy wie in hiele freon fan my.
I have a better idea.	Ik haw in better idee.
It is easy to find but also easy to make.	It is maklik te finen, mar ek maklik te meitsjen.
Maybe she had been.	Miskien hie se west.
I first took in the baby.	Ik naam earst it bern yn.
I just want you to think about this with me.	Ik wol gewoan dat jo hjir mei my oer tinke.
I'm glad you're better.	Ik bin bliid dat jo better binne.
That was so nice.	Dat wie sa moai.
That is, he does what is right.	Dat is, hy docht wat goed is.
He knew these people and their lives.	Hy koe dizze minsken en har libben.
Just go please.	Allinnich asjebleaft gean.
And she saw it too.	En se seach it ek.
She said it as it was.	Se sei it as it wie.
It seemed too good to be true.	It like te moai om wier te wêzen.
He saw nothing.	Hy seach neat .
Even if you may be good, maybe bad.	Sels as jo miskien goed binne, miskien min.
I was nothing and had nothing.	Ik wie neat en hie neat.
This all happens to be true.	Dit alles bart te wêzen wier.
He looked at me.	Hy seach my oan.
Well, that made one of us.	No, dat makke ien fan ús.
It was so hard.	It wie sa dreech.
Chances are you're one of them.	De kâns is dat jo ien fan har binne.
And they did a lot of talking.	En se diene in protte praat.
I could do that.	Dat koe ik wol.
Well, you can actually do that.	No, dat kinne jo eins dwaan.
I had to see you.	Ik moast dy sjen.
He says he will have a car one day.	Hy seit dat er op in dei in auto sil hawwe.
There was never anything to give and take.	Der wie nea wat jaan en nimme.
We know he's a good guy.	Wy witte dat hy in goede keardel is.
He did not like it.	Hy mocht it net.
he said.	hy sei.
But if it's mine, do it.	Mar as it fan my is, doch it dan fuort.
It will come to work.	It sil oan it wurk komme.
And she loves him.	En se hâldt fan him.
I'm fine.	Ik bin wol goed.
I'm just going home.	Ik gean mar nei hûs.
But do nothing.	Mar neat dwaan.
Not one thing.	Net ien ding.
I'll give him something to take home.	Ik sil him wat jaan om mei nei hûs te nimmen.
This is never heard.	Dit wurdt nea heard.
Mine does not.	Myn docht dat net.
This week it's getting really good.	Dizze wike wurdt it echt goed.
Just happy, happy, happy.	Krekt bliid, bliid, bliid.
For me, it was fun.	Foar my wie it leuk.
But that was not enough.	Mar dat wie net genôch.
But it had to be done.	Mar it moast dien wurde.
Nobody says anything.	Nimmen seit wat.
I'm something else.	Ik bin wat oars.
I'm never going to that place.	Ik gean noait nei dat plak.
She looked nice.	Se seach der aardich út.
I would be the first to do it.	Ik soe de earste wêze om it te dwaan.
Or a time in our lives.	Of in tiid yn ús libben.
Not like here.	Net sa as hjir.
So much more.	Safolle mear.
Kids always want to know things.	Bern wolle altyd dingen witte.
I'm still waiting for something.	Ik wachtsje noch wat.
She thought of everything.	Se tocht fan alles.
Life in prison is very difficult.	It libben yn 'e finzenis is heul dreech.
We just go and get it.	Wy geane gewoan en krije it.
It should do.	It soe dwaan moatte.
She liked it.	Se like der goed mei.
He had to go back, she said.	Hy moast werom, sei se.
You still do.	Dat dogge jo noch.
That is so today.	Dat is hjoed sa.
I've never seen one.	Ik haw noait ien sjoen.
Join us.	Wês by ús.
Never hurt her again.	Nea sear har wer.
I can not help it.	Ik kin it net helpe.
But someone put it here for a reason.	Mar immen sette it hjir foar in reden.
I wanted them in the book.	Ik woe se yn it boek ha.
You know, that's nothing.	Jo witte, dat is neat.
I'm afraid they can come to him.	Ik bin bang dat se by him komme kinne.
I'll go in with you.	Ik gean wol mei dy yn.
I knew we would be together again.	Ik wist dat wy wer tegearre wêze soene.
Where he intended to go.	Wêr't hy fan plan wie te gean.
I will take care of that myself.	Dêr sil ik sels foar soargje.
Nobody says a word.	Nimmen seit in wurd.
Where she would probably stay.	Wêr't se wierskynlik bliuwe soe.
He is a man of a few words.	Hy is in man fan in pear wurden.
Your next question is pretty easy.	Jo folgjende fraach is frij maklik.
I thought you would think so.	Ik tocht dat jo it tinke soene.
You are the good couple.	Jo binne it goede pear.
It is best to stick to plain water.	It is it bêste om te hâlden oan gewoan wetter.
I want to be me.	Ik wol my wêze.
I have to stop there.	Ik moat dêr ophâlde.
But do not say or do anything.	Mar net sizze of dwaan neat.
I just happened upon where it was made.	Ik krekt bard op wêr't it waard makke.
I'm an old man.	Ik bin in âld man.
He was angry.	Hy wie lilk.
I want you .	Ik wol dy .
I give it to you.	Ik jou it dy.
We put it out.	Wy sette it út.
It's not the time now.	It is no net de tiid.
Please think about it.	Tink dêr asjebleaft oer.
He did not even do a bit.	Hy die net iens in bytsje.
I know them too well.	Ik ken se te goed.
He just always seems to hurt.	Hy liket gewoan altyd sear.
I've never tried it.	Ik ha it noait besocht.
Life is hard there.	It libben is dêr dreech.
That we need to know.	Dat moatte wy witte.
The two children talked about school.	De twa bern hiene it oer skoalle.
It does not really hurt.	It docht net echt sear.
It just can not happen.	It kin gewoan net barre.
I almost quit.	Ik hâld der hast op.
I'm going there.	Ik gean der hinne.
She had so little.	Se hie sa'n bytsje.
She wanted that made her life for her.	Se woe dat har libben foar har makke.
I need someone to walk me through.	Ik haw ien nedich om my troch te gean.
If not, when?	As no net, wannear dan?
My father was there too.	Myn heit wie der ek.
Tell him everything you've told me.	Fertel him alles wat jo my ferteld hawwe.
How do you do it.	Hoe dogge jo it.
My family and friends.	Myn famylje en freonen.
Of course, they did not go any differently.	Fansels binne se net oars gien.
You will be surprised.	Jo sille ferrast wurde.
And you have to help us get it back.	En jo moatte ús helpe om it werom te krijen.
If there's anything here.	As is hjir wat.
They say it not so well.	Se sizze it net sa goed.
I want you out of here.	Ik wol dy hjir wei.
I know they have no say in what is good.	Ik wit dat se gjin sizzen hawwe oer wat goed is.
Take good care of nice thing.	Soargje goed foar moai ding.
You want to help in some way.	Jo wolle op ien of oare manier helpe.
We are man and woman.	Wy binne man en frou.
And your father does not know that you are here, not yet.	En dyn heit wit net datst hjir bist, noch net.
But they are not alone in holding such faith.	Mar se binne net allinnich yn it hâlden fan sa'n leauwe.
By doing this.	Troch dit te dwaan.
What he the.	Wat hy die.
This is on him.	Dit is op him.
Why not now ?.	Wêrom no net?.
We could see nothing.	Wy koene neat sjen.
These are not the same thing.	Dit binne net itselde ding.
This is very good.	Dit is hiel goed.
Until then, let me just be clear.	Oant dan, lit my gewoan dúdlik wêze.
For my city.	Foar myn stêd.
It was my first job.	It wie myn earste baan.
I also love his other problems.	Ik hâld ek fan syn oare problemen.
This just may not be true.	Dit kin gewoan net wier wêze.
The time of day was different.	De tiid fan de dei wie oars.
I looked around the room.	Ik seach de keamer om.
We will not hurt you.	Wy sille jo net sear dwaan.
He needed to know what was going on.	Hy moast witte wat der oan de hân wie.
This has been a pretty big day.	Dit hat in moai grutte dei west.
I'll tell you everything when you get here.	Ik sil jo alles fertelle as jo hjir komme.
That has never happened before.	Dat is noch nea earder bard.
But it can be real.	Mar it kin echt wêze.
I got who she was.	Ik krige wa't se wie.
The year is going by hard.	It jier giet hurd troch.
I believe we can get there.	Ik leau dat wy dêr komme kinne.
I'm not scared anymore.	Ik bin net bang mear.
That would be very different from that.	Dat soe hiel oars wêze as dy.
He probably would not even believe you.	Hy soe jo wierskynlik net iens leauwe.
She went home to school every day with her mother.	Se gie alle dagen nei skoalle mei har mem nei hûs.
I do not know where is.	Ik wit net wêr is.
He wanted to know the time.	Hy woe de tiid witte.
This for you first.	Dit foar jo earst.
There was one before and one after.	Der wie in foar en in nei.
Or my mother.	Of myn mem.
If you do not stop, you will regret it.	As jo ​​net ophâlde, sille jo it spyt hawwe.
None of us know what you are anymore.	Net ien fan ús wit mear wat jo binne.
She has been living alone ever since.	Se wennet sûnt dy tiid allinnich.
Come and try it today.	Kom en besykje it hjoed.
This is not found right now.	Dit is no net te finen.
I'm not good.	Ik bin net goed.
The young man was tired.	De jonge man wie wurch.
Well, he's worried.	No, hy makket him soargen.
Be with your friends.	Wês mei dyn freonen.
And they were mine now.	En se wiene no myn.
You're the problem here.	Jo binne it probleem hjir.
He completely changes it.	Hy makket it hielendal om.
All the time.	De hiele tiid.
But there was only me.	Mar der wie allinnich ik.
There is no problem there.	Der is gjin probleem dêr.
Talk, 'she said.	Praat,' sei se.
It does me a lot of good there.	In protte goed docht it my dêr.
More likely three.	Mear wierskynlik trije.
It should be that time of year again.	It moat wer dy tiid fan it jier wêze.
It was his only hope.	It wie syn ienige hope.
We have been waiting for this for a long time.	Wy hawwe hjir lang op wachte.
That was probably good, but it did not feel good.	Dat wie wierskynlik goed, mar it fielde net goed.
He is clearly not a man.	Hy is dúdlik gjin man.
You were wrong.	Jo wiene ferkeard.
The girl is his.	It famke is fan him.
Been there and done that.	Der west en dat dien.
But he did not look alone.	Mar hy seach net allinnich.
It seemed almost too good to be true.	It like hast te moai om wier te wêzen.
I know people who know them.	Ik ken minsken dy't se ken.
I just hope to be so good one day.	Ik hoopje mar ien dei sa goed te wêzen.
I thought it could be so.	Ik tocht dat it sa wêze koe.
We do not have a day yet.	Wy hawwe noch gjin dei.
I think this time will not be any different.	Ik tink dat dizze kear net oars sil wêze.
There's a little water.	Dêr is in bytsje wetter.
But be careful.	Mar wês foarsichtich.
She handed it over to him.	Se joech it him oer.
They will not work.	Se sille net wurkje.
We need two for these people.	Wy hawwe twa nedich foar dizze minsken.
I have to do this.	Ik moat dit dwaan.
But this time.	Mar dizze kear.
Come in, get done and go out.	Kom yn, meitsje dien en gean út.
It's just for me.	It is gewoan foar my.
I know him forever.	Ik ken him foar altyd.
We're not surprised you did.	Wy binne net ferrast dat jo it dien hawwe.
But this is clear.	Mar dit is dúdlik.
We were both scared.	Wy wiene beide bang.
She did, really.	Se die, echt.
You can stop worrying about it.	Jo kinne ophâlde te soargen oer it.
You can be pretty sure of that.	Dêr kinne jo frij wis fan wêze.
It was the book, of course, but there was more.	It wie fansels it boek, mar der wie mear.
And it kind of is.	En it soarte fan is.
No one would know what she had done.	Nimmen soe witte wat se dien hie.
It will just be for the two of us.	It sil gewoan foar ús twa wêze.
But please, do not give me away.	Mar asjebleaft, jou my asjebleaft net ôf.
He told the truth.	Hy fertelde de wierheid.
But there really is no way for me to tell.	Mar d'r is echt gjin manier foar my om te fertellen.
I do not know how to help you.	Ik wit net hoe ik dy helpe moat.
We know more now than ever before.	Wy witte no mear as earder.
For someone to come and help.	Foar immen om te kommen en te helpen.
We like it here.	Wy fine it hjir goed.
I've heard a lot about you.	Ik haw in protte oer dy heard.
She's a good woman.	Se is in goede frou.
We're going home now.	Wy geane no nei hûs.
That's them.	Dat binne se.
An opportunity to do something different.	In kâns om wat oars te dwaan.
My husband is here too.	Myn man is hjir ek.
That's exactly the kind of person he is.	Dat is krekt it soarte fan persoan hy is.
You do not get away.	Jo komme net fuort.
You can see why.	Jo kinne sjen wêrom.
What are your thoughts on this ?.	Wat binne jo gedachten oer dit?.
I wait.	Ik wachtsje.
He had to buy it twice before he got it.	Hy moast it twa kear keapje foardat hy it krige.
It has nothing to do with me.	It is neat mei my te krijen.
That's true.	Dat is wier.
Same as you.	Itselde as dy.
His father had not yet heard of it.	Syn heit hearde noch net om.
Of course, this does not work.	Fansels wurket dit net.
You did everything.	Do hast alles dien.
He was worried about you.	Hy wie soargen oer dy.
This is that person.	Dit is dy persoan.
I'm trying to help.	Ik besykje te helpen.
Not so good.	Net sa goed.
And if you do, work hard to stay open.	En as jo dogge, wurkje hurd om iepen te bliuwen.
She was so good.	Se wie sa goed.
I need to do something.	Ik moat wat dwaan.
And her here.	En har hier.
You never really get anything for nothing in this life.	Jo krije noait echt wat foar neat yn dit libben.
Stop, stop.	Hâld op, hâld op.
They are not against me.	Se binne net tsjin my.
But there was something else now.	Mar der wie no wat oars.
It obviously seemed different.	It like fansels oars.
But it leaves us with two questions.	Mar it lit ús mei twa fragen.
Well, that just will not do.	No, dat sil gewoan net dwaan.
It happens to me too.	It bart my ek.
Tell me why you want to.	Fertel my wêrom jo wolle.
And he was the only one who knew.	En hy wie de ienige dy't wist.
And remember to come here with my family, among other things.	En tink der om ûnder oare te kommen hjir mei myn famylje.
I'm not so sure about that.	Dêr bin ik net sa wis fan.
Things are not always what they seem.	Dingen binne net altyd wat se lykje.
We're too late.	Wy binne al te let.
There was nothing to do.	Der wie neat te dwaan.
Kids there love him.	Bern dêr hâlde fan him.
They must be.	Se moatte wêze.
Of course we did.	Fansels hawwe wy it dien.
This is where they live.	Dit wêr't se wenje.
A few actually.	In pear eins.
But we must not go now.	Mar wy moatte no net gean.
She looks around.	Se sjocht om.
Maybe he's going back with her now.	Miskien giet er no mei har werom.
To you.	Foar dy.
But she could not.	Mar se koe net.
How many.	Hoefolle.
It did not hurt anymore.	It die net mear sear.
I give it all up.	Ik jou it allegear op.
She liked to go to the movies.	Se mocht graach nei de film gean.
How are you going to do the same ?.	Hoe sille jo itselde dwaan?.
One is the idea of ​​truth.	Ien is it idee fan wierheid.
Not much else seems to make it here.	Net folle oars liket it hjir te meitsjen.
It's going well with him.	It giet goed mei him.
They are what they are.	Se binne wat se binne.
I just need one here for me.	Ik ha hjir gewoan ien foar my nedich.
Be kind to your parents.	Wês aardich foar dyn âlden.
Once or twice she looked back.	Ien of twa kear seach se werom.
I want to know.	Ik wol witte.
But it was careful.	Mar it wie foarsichtich.
So it seems.	Sa liket it.
We would talk for hours and hours.	Wy soene oeren en oeren prate.
I just wanted to be in the movie.	Ik woe gewoan yn 'e film wêze.
She did not let him hold many people.	Se liet him net in protte minsken hâlde.
If it's nothing else, it's that.	As it neat oars is, dan is it dat.
And it really works.	En it wurket echt.
Everyone should have that opportunity.	Elkenien moat dy kâns hawwe.
We would not need him, not yet.	Wy soene him net nedich hawwe, noch net.
I'm home now.	Ik bin no thús.
It seemed to help.	It like te helpen.
The same could happen here.	Itselde koe hjir barre.
There are plenty of those.	Der binne genôch fan dy.
And if we have to go, we have to do it soon.	En as wy gean moatte, moatte wy dat gau dwaan.
He agreed.	Hy wie it iens.
This is what will happen.	Dit is wat der barre sil.
But not really.	Mar net echt.
It's not about money.	It giet net om jild.
We're going back to my house.	Wy geane werom nei myn hûs.
He tried so hard to make you like him.	Hy hat sa hurd besocht om jo him leuk te meitsjen.
But he was not interested in her.	Mar hy wie net ynteressearre yn har.
Then again, maybe no one is.	Dan wer, miskien gjinien is.
How was it with her, he asked himself.	Hoe wie it mei har, frege er him ôf.
But it's the right thing to do.	Mar it is it goede ding om te dwaan.
But he knew he would not.	Mar hy wist dat er net soe.
I wish you and her the best.	Ik winskje dy en har it bêste ta.
You can keep them better.	Jo kinne se better hâlde.
I hope it's good.	Ik hoopje dat it goed is.
It works for me.	It wurket foar my.
Anyway, here it is.	Hoe dan ek, hjir is it.
I'm leaving you.	Ik gean fan dy ôf.
It's a good life there.	It is dêr in goed libben.
It does not seem so.	It liket net sa.
They are wrong.	Se binne ferkeard.
She was home.	Se wie thús.
There he is.	Dêr is er.
It does not matter who.	It makket neat út wa.
She should be with her mother.	Se soe by har mem wêze moatte.
Just get out of here.	Gean hjir mar út.
All but one that is.	Allegear, mar ien dat is.
But the problem is different.	Mar it probleem is oars.
Everyone should eat.	Elkenien moat ite.
And he would love to wait here.	En hy soe graach wachtsje hjir.
I have read it again and again.	Ik haw it wer en wer lêzen.
But without it he would not have been better.	Mar sûnder it wie hy net better.
I had a husband and he was a good man.	Ik hie in man en hy wie in goed man.
But she was different now.	Mar se wie no oars.
They did not know where he came from.	Se wisten net wêr't er wei kaam.
I wonder what he wants from me this time, she thought.	Ik freegje my ôf wat er dizze kear fan my wol, tocht se.
You have to take the money and just.	Jo moatte nimme it jild en gewoan.
There was really nothing to see.	Der wie echt neat te sjen.
They would be too scared.	Se soene te bang wêze.
You can see more of his work at.	Jo kinne mear fan syn wurk sjen by.
What you want will be done.	Wat jo wolle, sil dien wurde.
I can handle this.	Ik kin dit wol oan.
Liet.	Liet.
I can never come to that house again.	Ik kin noait wer by dy thús komme.
There was a time when she would have said what she thought.	Der wie in tiid dat se soe hawwe sein wat se tocht.
Both work well.	Beide wurkje goed.
But it had happened.	Mar it wie bard.
People need to know it.	Minsken moatte it witte.
Do not speak to me.	Praat net tsjin my.
I met him at her home.	Ik moete him by har thús.
There was no one to help her.	Der wie gjinien om har te helpen.
It would have been to do the right thing.	It soe west hawwe om it goede ding te dwaan.
Or see for yourself.	Of sjoch sels.
So we decided not to do it this time.	Dat wy besletten om it dizze kear net te dwaan.
Do you really need it? 	Binne jo it echt nedich?
Must be fairly easy to get.	Moat frij maklik te krijen wêze.
he asked.	hy frege.
You know how she is.	Jo witte hoe't se is.
I walked away.	Ik rûn fuort.
He does what everyone is afraid to do.	Hy docht wat allegear bang binne om te dwaan.
I'm as busy as ever.	Ik bin sa drok as altyd.
I do not want to do it here.	Ik wol it hjir net dwaan.
He was a great man.	Hy wie in grutte man.
He's not up to it.	Hy is der net oan.
We've never heard that before.	Dat ha wy noch noait earder heard.
I could do it for her.	Ik koe se it dwaan.
She says she does.	Se seit dat se docht.
That never happened.	Dat is nea bard.
A lot can happen in a year.	Der kin in protte barre yn in jier.
Well, it does not matter now.	No, it makket no neat út.
And he wanted to see this man.	En hy woe dizze man sjen.
There was no reason for that.	Dêr wie gjin reden ta.
But, more needs to be done.	Mar, der moat mear dien wurde.
That we can be friends.	Dat wy freonen wêze kinne.
Not once.	Net ien kear.
She has her at home forever.	Se hat har foar altyd thús.
Maybe they find that they can not.	Miskien fine se dat se it net kinne.
First thing tomorrow.	Earste ding moarn.
We have not seen them much.	Wy hawwe se net folle sjoen.
You do not have to stick to them exactly.	Jo hoege jo net krekt oan har te hâlden.
He was sitting in his car.	Hy siet yn syn auto.
It was not only work for him, but also fun.	It wie net allinnich wurk foar him, mar ek leuk.
She had been doing it for too long.	Se hie it te lang dien.
I do not need such a house.	Sa'n hûs haw ik net nedich.
I'll go to him.	Ik sil nei him ta.
He should have known better.	Hy hie better witte moatten.
What did you think of that?	Wat hat jo dêr oan tinke?
But that was not all.	Mar dat wie net alles.
You will not keep holding.	Jo sille gjin hâlden hâlde.
I had to try.	Ik moast besykje.
Maybe something else.	Miskien wat oars.
There is much more for us.	D'r is in protte mear foar ús.
I'm going into town.	Ik gean de stêd yn.
If you think you'll get better, you'll do it.	As jo ​​​​tinke dat jo better wurde, dan sille jo dat dwaan.
He asked him if she had gone to bed.	Hy frege him ôf oft se op bêd gien wie.
This time he would believe it, maybe.	Dizze kear soe er it leauwe, miskien.
I do not see why not.	Ik sjoch net wêrom net.
That has been a long time in the past.	Dat is al lang yn it ferline.
I thought he would be back here.	Ik tocht dat er hjir werom soe.
Back to you.	Werom nei dy.
Do you have enough to eat today?	Hawwe jo hjoed genôch te iten?
Two more years.	Noch twa jier.
It was fun to be with family and friends.	It wie leuk om mei famylje en freonen te wêzen.
That he would do.	Dat soe er dwaan.
Time.	Tiid.
I do a lot of that these days.	Ik doch in protte fan dat dizze dagen.
You know he never took you out of there.	Jo witte dat hy jo der noait út naam.
Get ready early.	Wês betiid klear.
It was the right thing to do.	It wie it goede ding om te dwaan.
It's a good movie.	It is in goede film.
I see it as home.	Ik sjoch it as thús.
Come in.	Kom der yn.
It made her look different.	It makke har der oars út.
I may not.	Ik mei net.
That is not the problem here at all.	Dat is hjir hielendal net it probleem.
Please go see this movie.	Gean asjebleaft dizze film te sjen.
It will not be days.	It sil gjin dagen wêze.
Then she goes and does it again.	Dan giet se en docht it wer.
Time is a good thing to give to a friend.	Tiid is in goed ding om te jaan oan in freon.
But you can help me if you can tell me more.	Mar jo kinne my helpe as jo my mear fertelle kinne.
But there is a place.	Mar der is in plak.
I would say that this should be very clear.	Ik soe sizze dat dit hiel dúdlik wêze moat.
That has never been a question.	Dat hat noait in fraach west.
They need you for their lives.	Se hawwe jo nedich foar har libben.
He was tall and looked good.	Hy wie lang en seach goed út.
He walked a little ahead of me.	Hy rûn my in bytsje foar.
Let me be.	Lit my mar wêze.
I can not wait to see what there is to buy.	Ik kin net wachtsje om te sjen wat der te keapjen is.
I hope they would like it.	Ik hope dat se it leuk fine soene.
Like a door.	As in doar.
He was exactly who he wanted to be.	Hy wie krekt wa't er wêze woe.
They do what they do and we do what we do.	Se dogge wat se dogge en wy dogge wat wy dogge.
We keep it up.	Wy hâlde it oan.
Not working on it yet.	Der noch net oan wurke.
I did not look out.	Ik seach net út.
But there are so many other things that can be done.	Mar d'r binne safolle oare dingen dy't dien wurde kinne.
In that car.	Yn dy auto.
I love you in the picture.	Ik hâld dy op de foto.
It really did not go so well.	It gie echt net sa goed.
This just happened.	Dit is net bard.
To hurt me.	Om my sear te dwaan.
They were obviously afraid of what would happen.	Se wiene fansels bang foar wat der barre soe.
It happened last week.	It barde ferline wike.
He came to me.	Hy kaam nei my ta.
Not until he told her.	Net oant er it har fertelde.
He told me he was going home.	Hy fertelde my dat er nei hûs gie.
There are so many of you.	D'r binne safolle fan jo.
I could not do it without her.	Ik koe it net sûnder har dwaan.
They do not stay long.	Se bliuwe net lang.
Try reading this.	Besykje dizze te lêzen.
I will find another way.	Ik sil in oare manier fine.
Not so much anymore.	Net sa folle net mear.
You have to get here.	Jo moatte hjir komme.
Well, it does not matter now.	No, it makket no neat út.
There was also nothing in it.	Der siet ek neat yn.
I have no children.	Ik ha gjin bern.
I never liked her.	Ik hie har noait leuk.
It can not be otherwise.	It kin net oars.
It would be fun.	It soe leuk wurde.
I think the police tried to get her husband.	Ik tink dat de plysje besocht har man te krijen.
He does not know what he wants to do.	Hy wit net wat er dwaan wol.
He died as a child.	Hy stoar as bern.
This should work, please try.	Dit soe moatte wurkje, besykje asjebleaft.
She comes to school every day by bus.	Se komt alle dagen mei de bus nei skoalle.
They are very angry.	Se binne tige lilk.
She looked.	Se seach.
This time she was sure of it.	Dizze kear wie se der wis fan.
He did many things to me.	Hy die in protte dingen oan my.
Not so late.	Net sa let.
It was now.	It wie no.
Nothing can be done about it.	Dêr kin neat oan dien wurde.
That has been this week.	Dat hat dizze wike west.
I came home from work and saw you.	Ik kaam thús fan it wurk en seach dy.
It did not look good.	It liet net goed sjen.
I'm afraid this is it.	Ik bin bang dat dit it is.
He did not get a new job.	Hy krige gjin nije baan.
I'm sure you'll know what to do.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo sille witte wat te dwaan.
It's really more a question of who can find her.	It is echt mear in fraach wa't se fine kin.
I had seen that myself.	Dat hie ik sels sjoen.
You grow up on each other.	Jo grutte elkoar op.
That will do it for us.	Dat sil it foar ús dwaan.
Just in case there is a problem.	Krekt as der in probleem is.
It was clear that the teacher was not right.	It wie dúdlik dat de learaar net goed wie.
I could not do without it.	Ik koe it net sûnder.
But here, no one.	Mar hjir, gjinien.
That would make me happy.	Dat soe my bliid meitsje.
He came back much too soon.	Hy kaam folle te gau werom.
It will probably be my last.	It sil wierskynlik myn lêste wêze.
I want it.	Ik wol it.
It is often done.	It wurdt faak dien.
For better or worse would still remain to be seen.	Foar better of min soe noch te sjen bliuwe.
She looked at the child.	Se seach nei it bern.
I loved them.	Ik hie fan har hâlden.
He told her to go inside.	Hy fertelde har om yn te gean.
The last man will have his say before it is ready.	De lêste man sil syn sizzen hawwe foardat it klear is.
Someone needs you, and we try to be there for him.	Immen hat dy nedich, en wy besykje der foar him te wêzen.
He should have taken a picture.	Hy hie in foto meitsje moatten.
But what wants is something very different.	Mar wat wol is wat hiel oars.
Now was not the time.	No wie de tiid net.
Be careful here.	Wês foarsichtich hjir.
You did not know how we were.	Jo wisten net hoe't wy wiene.
The police arrived.	De plysje kaam.
But he would not let her go ahead of time either.	Mar hy soe har ek net foar de tiid gean litte.
Here he thought the woman had come upon him.	Hjir tocht er dat de frou op him kaam wie.
Probably more than anyone else.	Wierskynlik mear as immen oars.
You talk to each other and have a good time.	Jo prate mei elkoar en hawwe in goede tiid.
He must have heard something.	Hy moat wat heard hawwe.
You should ask him.	Jo soene him freegje moatte.
It can, a little.	It kin, in bytsje.
She saw it happen.	Se seach it barre.
Here is that class to help with the question.	Hjir is dy klasse om te helpen mei de fraach.
More than once.	Mear as ien kear.
That was good.	Dat wie dan wol goed.
And nothing seemed to help.	En neat like te helpen.
She was so happy.	Se wie sa bliid.
You're not one of us.	Do bist net ien fan ús.
It hurt that she went through to home.	It die sear dat se gie troch nei hûs.
She just had it.	Se hie it gewoan.
Her father wanted her to be read well.	Har heit woe dat se goed lêzen waard.
It was more than enough.	It wie mear as genôch.
I should have done more.	Ik hie mear dwaan moatten.
They were late for the party.	Se wiene te let op it feest.
I see now that you really care about him.	Ik sjoch no dat jo echt om him soargje.
I knew at once what had happened.	Ik wist yn ien kear wat der bard wie.
But she had no chance to get away.	Mar se hie gjin kâns om fuort te kommen.
She wondered what he was thinking.	Se frege har ôf wêr't er oan tocht.
Tomorrow would be her last day.	Moarn soe har lêste dei wêze.
Not in a month.	Net yn in moanne.
We know what happened, we know who made it.	Wy witte wat der bard is, wy witte wa't it makke hat.
I think he is too.	Ik tink dat hy ek is.
She made it.	Se makke it.
It felt like he was a different person now.	It fielde as wie er no in oare persoan.
Neither of us had to say it.	Net ien fan ús hoegde it te sizzen.
Now you know the reason.	No witte jo de reden.
Well, let it be.	No, lit it wêze.
Well, she said, do it then.	No, sei se, doch it dan.
But you have to help me.	Mar jo moatte my helpe.
He came too late.	Hy kaam te let.
We just go on with our lives.	Wy geane gewoan troch mei ús libben.
My father was a good man.	Myn heit wie in goed man.
So now we know.	Sa no witte wy.
And she does not always do so.	En se docht net altyd sa.
One makes you good.	Ien makket dy goed.
And we believe them.	En wy leauwe se.
Now he can do whatever he wants.	No kin er dwaan wat er wol.
That should come from me.	Dat soe fan my komme moatte.
But it does matter.	Mar it komt der oan.
He knew what was coming.	Hy wist wat der komme soe.
I feel very happy here.	Ik fiel my hjir tige bliid.
It can be so hard.	It kin sa dreech wêze.
It was hard at that time.	It wie dreech yn dy tiid.
They never worked.	Se wurke noait.
He could be there.	Hy koe der wêze.
Then he must know that too.	Dan moat er dat ek witte.
She had been so sure he would believe the truth.	Se hie sa wis west dat er de wierheid leauwe soe.
She had never felt this way towards anyone.	Se hie nea fielde dizze manier nei immen.
Have these easy.	Hawwe dizze maklik.
Maybe she was afraid you would hurt me.	Miskien wie se bang dat jo my sear dwaan soene.
And there it is.	En dêr is it.
I'm sure you'll find him at home.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo him thús fine.
I have it now too.	Ik haw it no ek.
We try to do the best we can.	Wy besykje it bêste te dwaan dat wy kinne.
She told me about you.	Se hat my fan dy ferteld.
You have me too.	Do hast my ek hast.
But with me it just does not work.	Mar by my wurket it gewoan net.
And it will not be easy.	En it sil net maklik wurde.
Everything seems good to me.	Alles liket my goed.
I want or have nothing but that.	Ik wol of ha neat oars as dat.
It's a bit.	It is in bytsje.
Everything seems fine.	Alles liket goed.
He often eats out for food.	Hy yt faak út foar it iten.
She came out of the water.	Se kaam út it wetter.
Really, really good.	Echt, echt goed.
On my friends.	Op myn freonen.
See and.	Sjoch en.
He just kept coming.	Hy bleau mar kommen.
He told me to do nothing.	Hy fertelde my neat te dwaan.
I hope they will.	Ik hoopje dat se sille.
Can't even speak well.	Kin net iens goed prate.
She did not ask me to do that.	Dêr hat se my net nei frege.
It will not hurt you.	It sil jo gjin sear dwaan.
Everything is a bit off.	Alles is in bytsje ôf.
Are fairly common.	Binne frij gewoan.
Do not open it to anyone but me.	Doch it net iepen foar elkenien oars as my.
We were so bad.	Wy wiene sa min.
Good friends with each other.	Goede freonen mei elkoar.
My whole life.	Myn hiele libben.
It never happened to me.	It is my noait bard.
That may not be necessary.	Dat kin net nedich.
But it seems to me that you're doing well so far.	Mar it liket my ta dat jo it oant no ta goed dogge.
At one point, Dad was not there.	Op in kear wie heit der net.
You're too nice.	Do bist te aardich.
No words would come, nothing.	Gjin wurden soene komme, neat.
I do not know how that could be.	Ik wit net hoe't dat koe.
Other than that, it has to be good.	Oars dan dat, it moat wêze goed.
What? 	Wat?
I hope you will too.	Ik hoopje dat jo ek sille.
She could not even speak.	Se koe net iens prate.
Give me what we both want.	Jou my wat wy beide wolle.
I never do one.	Ik doch noait ien.
She really did not know how long.	Se wist eins net hoe lang.
Join us.	Doch mei oan ús.
And so she comes with it.	En sa komt se der mei.
She had her life in her.	Se hie har libben yn har.
We know it.	Wy witte it.
I'm waiting for you.	Ik wachtsje op dy.
Of course, this would require more children.	Fansels soe dit mear bern nedich wêze.
It went on for so long that it became fun.	It gie sa lang troch dat it leuk waard.
She let this happen.	Se liet dit barre.
Think no more of me than your mother.	Tink net mear oan my as dyn mem.
It put a lot of things into it.	It siet der in protte dingen yn.
Keep that in mind.	Hâld dat yn gedachten.
This is not our problem.	Dit is net ús probleem.
I do not want to do these things.	Ik wol dizze dingen net dwaan.
It had been too easy to get away from him.	It hie te maklik west om by him ôf te kommen.
She said she felt much better.	Se sei dat se har folle better fielde.
They are just two young people.	It binne mar twa jonge minsken.
I still had time, but probably not quite a lot.	Ik hie noch tiid, mar wierskynlik net in hiele protte.
I do not even see it.	Ik sjoch it sels net.
Water is life.	Wetter is libben.
Take her out of here.	Nim har hjir wei.
I really do not think they will.	Ik tink echt net dat se sille.
But they are enough.	Mar se binne genôch.
It went with her.	It gie mei har.
She's still a week away.	Se sil noch in wike fuort wêze.
I have not seen him.	Ik haw him net sjoen.
She looked up at me.	Se seach op nei my.
One more time maybe.	Noch ien kear miskien.
It all has to be done by hand.	It moat allegear mei de hân dien wurde.
I would like it better.	Ik soe it better wolle.
How nice of him.	Wat aardich fan him.
That must be it.	Dat moat it wêze.
My thoughts are with his family.	Myn gedachten binne by syn famylje.
However, next question.	Hoe dan ek, folgjende fraach.
He will get nothing out of it.	Hy sil der neat fan krije.
This can be whatever you want.	Dit kin wêze wat jo wolle.
It has for everything.	It hat foar alles wat.
None of it stayed with me.	Gjin fan it bleau my by.
Can anyone help me with this.	Kin immen helpe my mei dizze.
But look out.	Mar sjoch út.
Truth is truth.	Wierheid is wierheid.
There is almost nothing left on her name.	Der is hast neat oer op har namme.
My plan did not work.	Myn plan wurke net.
He has been here a lot.	Hy hat hjir in protte west.
I hope this gets you on the right track.	Ik hoopje dat dit jo op 'e goede manier komt.
But everyone wanted to make that a problem.	Mar elkenien woe dat in probleem meitsje.
He knew the day was coming.	Hy wist dat de dei kaam.
It's the water.	It is it wetter.
That she could not keep me.	Dat koe se my net hâlde.
We should not have them.	Wy moatte se net hawwe.
It's very much too late.	It is hiel folle te let.
What's there about him?	Wat is der fan him oer.
The next time he thought to himself.	De oare kear tocht er by himsels.
He did not realize he was in the room.	Hy realisearre net dat er de keamer yn rûn wie.
Life is work.	It libben is wurk.
You do not have to worry about it.	Jo hoege jo gjin soargen te meitsjen.
You have to look after.	Jo moatte sjen nei.
Nice to hear that name.	Leuk om dy namme foar te kommen.
The two are really very different.	De twa binne echt hiel oars.
Do you still have questions?	Hawwe jo noch fragen?
He sits by the lake and looks at the water.	Hy sit by de mar en sjocht nei it wetter.
It was hard for me to deal with.	It wie dreech foar my om te gean mei.
We had life.	Wy hiene it libben.
I have a lot of these.	Ik haw in protte fan dizze.
I doubt it, mind you.	Ik twifelje der oan, tink.
Maybe one day.	Miskien ien dei.
Who is.	Wa is.
The work began at once.	It wurk begûn yn ien kear.
I probably still do.	Ik wierskynlik noch.
Give people a chance to see this the right way.	Jou minsken in kâns om dit op 'e goede manier te sjen.
Waiting for me in the car.	Wachtsje op my yn 'e auto.
But his mother looked tired.	Mar syn mem seach wurch.
She did it right.	Se hat it goed dien.
It's just there to see.	It is der gewoan om te sjen.
We'll talk.	Wy sille prate.
He had a job, a wife and a child.	Hy hie in baan, in frou en in bern.
Make it in time for the meeting!	Meitsje it op 'e tiid foar de gearkomste!
They are gone now.	Se binne no fuort.
I do not really go in for that kind of thing.	Ik gean net echt yn foar dat soarte dingen.
But it will happen.	Mar it sil barre.
Your father will do what he wants.	Jo heit sil dwaan wat er wol.
I think differently these days.	Ik tink oars dizze dagen.
We need to get out of here.	Wy moatte hjir út komme.
We need to keep him talking.	Wy moatte him oan it praten hâlde.
It was not to be.	It wie net te wêzen.
He looked back.	Hy seach werom.
Your other kids have been fine.	Jo oare bern hawwe it goed west.
I thought you could do something about it.	Ik tocht dat jo der wat mei kinne.
I'll just tell you something.	Ik sil dy mar fertelle wat.
I tried everything out there.	Ik besocht alles út dêr.
Nothing there either.	Dêr ek neat.
He also does not like work so well.	Hy hâldt ek net sa goed wurk.
They do not want anything to happen to him.	Se wolle net dat der wat mei him bart.
Why the se.	Wêrom die se.
She should think soon.	Se soe gau tinke moatte.
A boy, he said.	In jonge, sei er.
We were a couple.	Wy wiene in pear.
Every now and then he tried to say something.	Sa no en dan besocht er wat te sizzen.
It holds a man in one way or another.	It hâldt in man op ien of oare manier.
Then on to the next.	Dan op nei de folgjende.
Everyone said she was.	Elkenien sei dat se wie.
Why do not you do that now.	Wêrom dogge jo dat no net.
She has never spoken like that.	Se hat noait sa praat.
But there you have to be careful.	Mar dêr moatte jo foarsichtich wêze.
It is not to say.	It is net te sizzen.
And sure, that time would be now.	En wis, dy tiid soe no wêze.
He could not stop it now.	Hy koe it no net ophâlde.
I just wish there were more.	Ik woe gewoan dat der mear wiene.
In fact, the money was not there.	Om de wierheid te sizzen wie it jild der net.
I'm not the only one who knows of this place.	Ik bin net de iennichste dy't wit fan dit plak.
I'll get out of his way soon.	Ik gean gau út syn wei.
She's just a woman.	Se is mar in frou.
First, this is a big month for us.	Earst is dit in grutte moanne foar ús.
Or, if they did, they never said.	Of, as se dat diene, se nea sein.
Come in.	Kom der yn.
One of two things would happen.	Ien fan twa dingen soe barre.
I hit it pretty hard.	Ik rekke it moai hurd.
But just be careful when you do.	Mar wês gewoan foarsichtich as jo dogge.
She wants to know how.	Se wol witte hoe.
Then they go on.	Dan geane se troch.
And that she did not want to be.	En dat woe se net wêze.
She looked no further.	Se seach der gjin wei út.
After it happened.	Nei it barde.
So much work.	Safolle wurk.
I would like to return home.	Ik wol graach werom nei hûs.
How wrong we have been.	Hoe ferkeard hawwe wy west.
That was hard to take.	Dat wie dreech om te nimmen.
Here was a good wife and good husband.	Hjir wie in goede frou en goed man.
You are afraid of everything.	Do bist fan alles bang.
He was easy to read.	Hy wie maklik te lêzen.
Tell us where you are.	Fertel ús wêr't jo binne.
I could think.	Ik koe tinke.
It was not one of those things.	It wie net ien fan dizze dingen.
He was not ready yet.	Hy wie noch net klear.
Then and where and.	Dan en wêr en.
It was very hard to see.	It wie hiel dreech om te sjen.
She had not told him yet.	Se hie it him noch net ferteld.
We'll see.	Wy sille wol sjen.
Leave me in the water.	Lit my yn it wetter.
Of course, he did not have much to say.	Fansels hie er net folle te sizzen.
It was just a lot of work to get here.	It wie gewoan in protte wurk om hjir te kommen.
I need some work on my book.	Ik haw wat wurk nedich oan myn boek.
We never talked about it.	Wy hawwe it der noait oer hân.
I have to go.	Ik moat fuort.
He came back.	Hy kaam werom.
So it's done.	Sa is it dien.
Was the mother of his children.	Wie de mem fan syn bern.
I made it myself.	Ik makke it sels.
So we have to do exactly the same thing.	Sa moatte wy krekt itselde dwaan.
They need you, not just want you.	Se hawwe dy nedich, net allinnich wolle dy.
I will then have a better plan.	Ik sil dan in better plan hawwe.
He took three.	Hy naam trije.
They want to help.	Se wolle helpe.
Of course that was true of me.	Fansels wie dat wier fan my.
That was better, he thought.	Dat wie better, tocht er.
how is the new job ?.	hoe is de nije baan?.
She loves me.	Se hâldt fan my.
It knows it's more than that.	It wit dat it mear is dan dat.
But you do not leave us here.	Mar jo litte ús hjir net.
It's such a time again.	It is wer sa'n tiid.
The other was a man.	De oare wie in man.
What kind of food, how much food.	Wat foar iten, hoefolle iten.
He had lived better.	Hy hie der better oan wenne.
Look at that boy.	Sjoch nei dy jonge.
More would not be necessary.	Mear soe net nedich wêze.
I've not told you before.	Ik haw it dy net earder ferteld.
They have hard lives.	Se hawwe hurd libben.
And nothing else.	En neat oars.
Time is prison.	Tiid is finzenis.
Do not believe it.	Leau it net.
Of course it has to be.	Fansels moat it wêze.
Nobody wants a dog to get hurt.	Nimmen wol dat in hûn sear wurdt.
I'm old.	Ik bin âld.
He's actually nice though.	Hy is eins wol aardich.
I'm not looking at it that way.	Ik sjoch der net sa nei.
It has been for you.	It hat foar dy west.
We are not ready.	Wy binne net klear.
That is the best you can come up with?	Dat is it bêste dat jo kinne komme mei?
I'm a man back to life.	Ik bin in man werom ta it libben.
They love her.	Se hâlde fan har.
I have them.	Ik haw har.
They did it once for a few days.	Se hawwe it ien kear dien foar in pear dagen.
He has known her since that time.	Hy ken har sûnt dy tiid.
I can come to you.	Ik kin jo komme.
She was worried about her children.	Se wie soargen oer har bern.
We have heard them.	Wy hawwe se heard.
He was a very good man.	Hy wie in hiel goed man.
Let's show it.	Lit ús it sjen litte.
It is very easy to find them.	It is heul maklik om se te finen.
That was not expected.	Dat hie net ferwachte.
I probably would.	Ik soe wierskynlik.
Let me tell you something.	Lit my dy wat fertelle.
The word went around.	It wurd gie om.
I just do not think they get it.	Ik tink gewoan net dat se it krije.
The police do not know what to do.	De plysje wit net wat te dwaan.
But it was not him.	Mar it wie net hy.
They were not very happy with me.	Se wiene net hiel bliid mei my.
What to do.	Wat te dwaan.
I still see that a lot.	Dat sjoch ik noch in protte.
That the film would talk to her.	Dat de film mei har prate soe.
I don't have.	Ik haw gjin.
I found him very nice.	Ik fûn him hiel moai.
That, you can also try, if you want.	Dat, jo kinne ek besykje, as jo wolle.
But not quite.	Mar net hiel.
She was talking about someone who said something about anything.	Se hie it oer ien dy't wat sei oer wat dan ek.
But it's still going too hard.	Mar it giet noch te hurd.
I know you can do it.	Ik wit dat jo it kinne.
I feel it.	Ik fiel it.
I love you for being my friend.	Ik hâld fan dy om myn freon te wêzen.
He says he needs it for his job.	Hy seit dat er it nedich hat foar syn wurk.
I was not sure what would happen.	Ik wie der net wis fan wat der barre soe.
It just happened.	It barde krekt.
We are of the people and they are of us.	Wy binne fan 'e minsken en se binne fan ús.
And that was them.	En dat wiene se.
It should work now.	It soe no wurkje moatte.
Be the question of today.	De fraach fan hjoed wêze.
And he really loves this person.	En hy hâldt echt fan dizze persoan.
Not sure what the best way is to go about it.	Net wis wat de bêste manier is om der oer te gean.
Just a boy.	Krekt in jonge.
I saw things differently.	Ik seach dingen oars.
A first one.	In earste dy.
I'm afraid that's all we have.	Ik bin bang dat is alles wat wy hawwe.
She asked alone.	Se frege allinnich.
Afraid of nothing.	Bin bang foar neat.
It's easy to buy.	It is maklik om yn te keapjen.
Is everything okay?	Is alles goed?
She once came for my father, not for me.	Se kaam eartiids foar myn heit, net foar my.
And not a bit.	En net in bytsje.
Or that is not there.	Of dat is der net.
She was not back.	Se wie net werom.
I was angry.	Ik wie lilk.
Take the family.	Nim de famylje.
Do not worry about the money.	Sit gjin soargen oer it jild.
That did come, she knew.	Dat kaam wol, wist se.
I had to know, see.	Ik moast it witte, sjen.
I do not agree with that.	Dat bin ik net iens.
I just love this guy.	Ik hâld gewoan fan dizze keardel.
He knows the problem very well.	Hy wit it probleem tige goed.
We can know many things.	Wy kinne in protte dingen witte.
He looks just as bad, now.	Hy sjocht der krekt sa min út, no.
This was not the time or the place.	Dit wie net de tiid of it plak.
You are this or that, a word is this or that.	Do bist dit of dat, in wurd is dat of dit.
He's still a man.	Hy is noch in man.
I would like to know why.	Ik soe witte wolle wêrom.
I'm not telling anyone.	Ik fertel it net oan immen.
In time you will.	Yn 'e tiid sille jo.
Mom made me careful.	Mem makke my foarsichtich.
I'm a good girl.	Ik bin in goed famke.
It was beautiful.	It wie moai.
What about you?.	Wat tinke jo?.
My dad said we do not want to, actually.	Myn heit sei dat wy net wolle, eins.
They told him this.	Se hawwe him dit ferteld.
We just want to hurt each other.	Wy wolle elkoar gewoan sear dwaan.
He looked really bad.	Hy seach der echt min út.
This is the new one.	Dit is de nije.
They were beautiful.	Se wiene moai.
I love everything.	Ik hâld der fan alles oan.
Just as he expected.	Krekt as hy ferwachte.
This food is.	Dit iten is.
We want to do the right thing.	Wy wolle it goede dwaan.
You're the boy's father.	Do bist de heit fan de jonge.
He came home happy every day.	Hy kaam alle dagen bliid thús.
Do not see it.	Sjoch it net.
You have to come.	Jo moatte komme.
You may like it yourself.	Jo kinne it sels leuk fine.
I've seen the work.	Ik haw it wurk sjoen.
We needed someone there like her.	Wy hiene dêr ien as har nedich.
He did not know these people.	Hy koe dizze minsken net.
He did not expect that.	Dat hie er net ferwachte.
I was first.	Ik wie earst.
She has been.	Se hat west.
It should not.	It soe net moatte.
I looked at the next man's hair.	Ik seach nei it hier fan de folgjende man.
She would not give up.	Se soe net jaan.
They can help.	Se kinne helpe.
He did not want to be free.	Hy woe net frij wêze.
Not until tonight.	Net nei fannacht.
See the herring has fine.	Se sille har fine.
I want everything to be done the right way.	Ik wol dat alles op 'e goede manier dien wurdt.
There must be something.	Der hat wol wat.
I love reading on its own.	Ik hâld fan it lêzen op himsels.
It must be good enough.	It moat goed genôch wêze.
That woman there, reading a book.	Dy frou dêr, in boek te lêzen.
We can not wait any longer.	Wy kinne net mear wachtsje.
They are not human beings.	Se binne gjin minsken.
It's not a very good one.	It is net in hiel goede.
If he can believe her.	As er har leauwe kin.
Let me work.	Lit my wurkje.
We talk a lot.	Wy prate in protte.
It will not happen tomorrow, but it will come.	It sil moarn net barre, mar it sil komme.
We need to try this again soon, so we need to know.	Wy moatte dit gau wer besykje, dat moatte wy dan witte.
Let's talk about it.	Lit ús der oer prate.
I'm not sure how he got that name.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe't er by dy namme kaam.
He told us all about it.	Hy fertelde ús der alles oer.
And now you can have one and love it too.	En no kinne jo ien hawwe en der ek fan hâlde.
It will not be me.	It sil my net wêze.
I obviously did not.	Ik hie fansels net.
I, for one, am the last.	Ik, foar ien, bin de lêste.
He said he felt sick.	Hy sei dat er siik fielde.
I'm so worried.	Ik bin sa soargen.
You keep it that way.	Jo hâlde it sa.
Not everyone in the city is sick.	Net elkenien yn 'e stêd is siik.
Do not know if it has or not.	Wit net oft it hat of net.
You're family.	Do bist famylje.
It did again what it said.	It die wer wat it sei.
You know best.	Jo witte it bêste.
This very but he did.	Dit hiel mar hy die.
We realized that the plan would not work.	Wy realisearre dat it plan net wurkje soe.
You can never hold anything.	Jo kinne noait wat hâlde.
She told me what she told you.	Se fertelde my wat se fertelde dy.
She could ask.	Se koe freegje.
He can do whatever he wants.	Hy kin dwaan wat er wol.
That's what I would like.	Dat soe ik wol graach wolle.
Nobody knows why.	Nimmen wit wêrom.
She was just wrong about that.	Dêr wie se gewoan ferkeard oer.
He never liked me.	Hy mocht my noait leuk fine.
You need something, talk to me.	Do hast wat nedich, praat mei my.
Keep mom out of the way.	Hâld mem út 'e wei.
I do not want to think about it tonight, no more.	Ik wol der fannacht net oan tinke, mear net.
He had to get it out.	Hy moast it út.
But how? 	Mar hoe?
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
He was here, she knew now.	Hy wie hjir, wist se no.
In a way, she was tired.	Op in manier wie se wurch.
Not enough time to do the things she wanted to do.	Net genôch tiid om de dingen te dwaan dy't se woe.
We have to see.	Wy moatte sjen.
I can not get into that.	Dêr kin ik net yn komme.
Then work for money.	Dan wurkje foar jild.
That should have been it.	Dat hie it wol wêze moatten.
And even know.	En sels witte.
But he does.	Mar hy docht.
That would be good.	Dat soe goed wêze.
He really did not know.	Hy wist it echt net.
She talks to people.	Se praat mei minsken.
And this time, they take it in one day.	En dizze kear nimme se it yn ien dei.
But what was clear was my mother.	Mar wat wie dúdlik myn mem.
I just got one.	Ik krige krekt ien.
That was never the case.	Dat wie noait.
He requested a meeting.	Hy frege in gearkomste.
But it will not.	Mar it sil net.
I will not hurt you.	Ik sil dy net sear dwaan.
But even that was not enough.	Mar ek dat wie net genôch.
Never try to tell me what to do.	Besykje my noait te fertellen wat ik moat dwaan.
For us, it was our chance to give.	Foar ús wie it ús kâns om te jaan.
She gave him some money.	Se joech him wat jild.
He never left me.	Hy liet my noait oer.
I can even say that we have become friends.	Ik kin sels sizze dat wy freonen wurden binne.
I do not have it.	Ik haw it net.
The time is now three o'clock.	De tiid is no trije oere.
I will do what you ask.	Ik sil dwaan wat jo freegje.
She said.	Se sei.
I did not expect it to be so obvious.	Ik hie net ferwachte dat it sa dúdlik soe wêze.
Maybe two months.	Miskien twa moanne.
It can not.	It kin net.
Give her something to look at and you will make her happy.	Jou har wat om te sjen en jo sille har bliid meitsje.
It is given to you.	It wurd jo jûn.
Well, this is it.	No, dit is it.
Well, we'm going to bed.	No, wy geane op bêd.
Even if you do not need them now.	Ek as jo se no net nedich hawwe.
We should have let him be.	Wy hiene him wêze moatten litte.
He expected her to be at the party.	Hy ferwachte dat se op it feest soe wêze.
I need you with me here.	Ik haw dy by my hjir nedich.
They like a book or not.	Se hâlde fan in boek of net.
She is touched by his words.	Se is rekke troch syn wurden.
She has reason to be angry at her husband.	Se hat reden om lilk te wêzen op har man.
But not sure.	Mar net wis.
I know what these are like.	Ik wit hoe't dizze binne.
Not even a dog.	Net iens in hûn.
But not much.	Mar net folle.
He's there now.	Hy is der no.
There is a way for everyone.	Der is in manier foar elkenien.
Maybe there would be a time in a day.	Miskien soe der op in dei tiid wêze.
He has not done anything yet.	Hy hat noch neat dien.
She knows why she's there.	Se wit wêrom't se dêr is.
But he got none.	Mar hy krige gjinien.
Well, they were wrong.	No, se wiene ferkeard.
It just will not happen.	It sil gewoan net barre.
Or more than one woman.	Of mear as ien frou.
I will try it very hard.	Ik sil it hiel hurd besykje.
He was very worried about the girl.	Hy wie in protte soargen oer it famke.
I'm coming here tomorrow.	Ik kom hjir moarn.
But look at us now.	Mar sjoch ús no.
Now come on.	No kom op.
If one thing is wrong, then it is wrong.	As in ding ferkeard is, dan is it ferkeard.
I just left home.	Ik bin krekt fan hûs gien.
He really loves me and will do anything for me.	Hy hâldt echt fan my en sil alles foar my dwaan.
Or make sure someone does.	Of soargje dat immen dat docht.
You make me happy.	Jo meitsje my bliid.
Food is bad, and water is very bad.	Iten is min, en wetter is tige min.
Maybe she still does.	Miskien docht se noch wol.
But the words would not come.	Mar de wurden soene net komme.
Is not really something.	Is it net echt wat.
You're going home soon.	Jo geane gau nei hûs.
Works out well.	Wurket goed út.
The whole family was like that.	De hiele famylje wie sa.
We both knew it, right away.	Wy wisten it beide, fuort.
I'm sorry, but it can not help.	It spyt my, mar it kin net helpe.
They talk about it.	Se prate der oer.
Love the idea !.	Hâld fan it idee!.
It's so good to see you.	It is sa goed om dy te sjen.
I bought a pay as you go plan.	Ik kocht in betelje as jo gean plan.
I just want him to be happy, he said.	Ik wol gewoan dat er bliid is, sei er.
I think of her.	Ik tink oan har.
In just a few days he would see her again.	Oer mar dagen soe er har wer sjen.
What are yours ?.	Wat binne dyn?.
So she walks away.	Sa giet se fuort.
We have food.	Wy hawwe iten.
That was just not done.	Dat wie gewoan net dien.
If they let me, that will.	As se my litte, dat wol.
Ask, do not tell.	Freegje, net fertelle.
We hope to see you.	Wy hoopje dy te sjen.
You do what you can.	Jo dogge wat jo kinne.
Now none of that will happen.	No sil neat fan dat barre.
He was reading a book.	Hy wie in boek te lêzen.
Nobody said a word.	Nimmen sei in wurd.
Take what you need.	Nim wat jo nedich hawwe.
It's not been going so well lately.	It giet de lêste tiid net sa goed.
We had so little time together.	Wy hiene sa'n bytsje tiid tegearre.
And it's very early.	En it is hiel betiid.
People need to eat.	Minsken moatte ite.
Very good.	Hiel goed.
I can see you for what you really are.	Ik kin jo sjen foar wat jo echt binne.
After two months, no one knows where he is.	Nei twa moanne wit nimmen wêr't er is.
I let you have.	Ik lit dy hawwe.
The food is really good.	It iten is echt goed.
I should have been there for you, whatever.	Ik hie d'r foar dy wêze moatten, wat dan ek.
They can not find their way.	Se kinne har wei net fine.
I agreed with that.	Ik wie it der mei iens.
It does not matter what the truth is.	It makket net út wat de wierheid is.
I want to help, he said.	Ik wol helpe, sei er.
I do not really know who they were.	Ik wit net echt wa't se wiene.
I will not make you pay the money back.	Ik sil net meitsje jo betelje it jild werom.
Maybe it's the same.	Miskien is it itselde.
You will love it.	Jo sille it hâlde.
Do not ask this woman.	Freegje dizze frou net.
Did not know what he had, but had nothing to do with it.	Wist net wat er hie, mar hie der neat om.
Friends of friends.	Freonen fan freonen.
This is better.	Dit is better.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Oant no hat gjinien ien fûn.
No one knows what will become of him.	Nimmen wit wat der fan him wurde sil.
I was never afraid of hard work.	Ik wie nea bang foar hurd wurk.
Hold on to each other.	Hâld op foar elkoar.
Do better work.	Doch better wurk.
It had a little give to it, but not much.	It hie in bytsje jaan oan it, mar net folle.
He may have something there.	Hy kin dêr wat hawwe.
We never talked to each other.	Wy hawwe noait mei elkoar praat.
Have you seen one before?	Hawwe jo ien earder sjoen?
Nothing will happen to me.	Der sil neat mei my barre.
We try to make it easy.	Wy besykje it maklik te meitsjen.
That will get you back.	Dat krije jo werom.
I did not want to leave him.	Ik woe him net litte.
That's probably what always happens.	Dat is wierskynlik wat altyd bart.
She said help me, help me.	Se sei help my, help my.
He looked so old.	Hy like sa âld.
Let the children have water if they ask for it.	Lit de bern wetter hawwe as se der om freegje.
And nothing more.	En neat mear.
I do not know exactly where it is, he said.	Ik wit net krekt wêr't it is, sei er.
They will be open, 'she told us.	Se sille iepen wêze,' sei se tsjin ús.
All my friends are there.	Al myn freonen binne der.
She's not home.	Se is net thús.
They would come out of time.	Se soene út de tiid komme.
It's not in her room.	It is net yn har keamer.
Had done so.	Hie dat dien.
One thing she's not good at.	Ien ding is se net goed yn.
He will not talk to me anymore.	Hy sil net mear mei my prate.
There's nothing like that.	Der sit neat fan dat soarte yn.
You do not always have to include everything.	Jo hoege net altyd alles yn te hâlden.
People go in.	Minsken geane yn.
But let me tell you something.	Mar lit my dy wat fertelle.
But you are someone else.	Mar do bist immen oars.
He had never met me before.	Hy hie my noch noait earder moete.
Can even help.	Kin sels helpe.
It's more of an opportunity.	It is mear in kâns.
I do not know how this happened.	Ik wit net hoe't dit bard is.
It was so clear.	It wie sa dúdlik.
This is all too much for me.	Dit is my allegear te folle.
At that time it would be.	Yn dy tiid soe it wêze.
Well, it's one way to pass the time.	No, it is ien manier om de tiid troch te jaan.
We were out day in and day out with each other.	Wy wiene dei yn dei út mei elkoar.
It kept coming.	It bleau kommen.
He seems to be nice to people.	Hy liket aardich foar minsken te wêzen.
I liked it so much.	Ik mocht it sa leuk fine.
Been today, it all looks good.	Hjoed west, sjocht der allegear goed út.
That, of course, is a lot.	Dat is fansels in protte.
They have everything.	Se hawwe alles.
She was a good girl.	Se wie in goed famke.
I heard there were going to be problems.	Ik hearde dat der problemen komme.
I have to be there.	Ik moat der wêze.
But how do you do that.	Mar hoe dogge jo dat.
Much more than that happened.	Folle mear as dat barde.
She had done nothing wrong.	Se hie neat ferkeard dien.
But he did not stay there long.	Mar hy bleau dêr net lang.
He obviously could not find it from where he was.	Hy koe it fansels net fine fan wêr't er wie.
He hoped they would come to dinner.	Hy hope dat se oan it iten komme soene.
He could not believe what she had done.	Hy koe net leauwe wat se dien hie.
There is a.	Der is in.
He was never.	Hy wie nea.
He had a few friends.	Hy hie in pear freonen.
It would not have been good.	It soe net goed west hawwe.
We all need to do better.	Wy moatte it allegear better dwaan.
And that's actually good.	En dat is eins goed.
Just as you can yourself.	Krekt as jo sels kinne.
They have had their chance.	Se hawwe har kâns hân.
I might be able to help.	Ik kin miskien helpe.
She hoped it was not him.	Se hope dat it him net wie.
The one who did all the talking.	Dejinge dy't al it praten die.
They are just beautiful.	Se binne gewoan moai.
Sure enough, more hair is gone.	Wis genôch, mear hier is fuort.
For making him hurt her.	Foar it meitsjen fan him sear har.
I'm sure they like it.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se it leuk fine.
And now they hit him.	En no rekke se nei him.
Just in time.	Krekt foar de tiid.
Do not be too hard.	Wês net te hurd.
The first thing they do is make money from it.	It earste wat se dogge is der jild mei te meitsjen.
Not really anything to worry about.	Net echt wat te soargen oer.
Now, let me make something more clear.	No, lit my wat mear dúdlik meitsje.
Do not believe her.	Leau har net.
It went well.	It gie goed.
Pay close attention.	Let der goed op.
It's time to dump her and move on.	It is tiid om fuort te gean.
Your father died.	Dyn heit stoar.
Or even food.	Of sels iten.
It could not.	It koe net.
She would not know what it was that was expected of her.	Se soe net witte wat it wie dat fan har ferwachte waard.
We can not give you everything you want.	Wy kinne jo net alles jaan wat jo wolle.
Everyone has a chance.	Elkenien hat in kâns.
I need more.	Ik haw mear nedich.
It will not happen.	It sil net barre.
I would have, these days.	Ik soe hawwe, dizze dagen.
She wanted to tell you.	Se woe my it dy fertelle.
No problem finding the place.	Gjin probleem te finen it plak.
It's good or it's wrong.	It is goed of it is ferkeard.
The first out.	De earste út.
I need them to be the same.	Ik haw se nedich om itselde te wêzen.
She will never love you.	Se sil nea fan dy hâlde.
Look carefully at this photo.	Sjoch foarsichtich nei dizze foto.
And that was not the only time it happened.	En dat wie net de ienige kear dat it barde.
I still remember it.	Ik wit it noch.
They can do this.	Se kinne dit dwaan.
Hope to see you again soon !.	Hoopje har gau wer te sjen!.
If someone would put them in their place.	As immen se op har plak sette soe.
Make time to eat good food.	Meitsje de tiid om goed iten te iten.
Would love to stay here again.	Soe graach bliuwe hjir wer.
We'll see how this goes.	Wy sille sjen hoe't dit giet.
It is not clear.	It is net dúdlik.
There is still time to do something.	Der is noch tiid om wat te dwaan.
We both know you're not good.	Wy witte beide dat jo net goed binne.
Time was and time was not.	Tiid wie en tiid wie net.
I know nothing about it.	Ik wit der neat fan.
He was really a good man.	Hy wie echt in goed man.
I told him to come tomorrow.	Ik sei tsjin him om moarn te kommen.
You will see things that can make you so much better.	Jo sille dingen sjen dy't jo safolle better kinne meitsje.
I told him there was nothing to talk about.	Ik sei tsjin him dat der neat wie om oer te praten.
They are here just to do a job.	Se binne hjir gewoan om in wurk te dwaan.
So did friends.	Dat diene freonen.
She could watch the movie if she wanted to.	Se koe de film sjen as se woe.
It's really about.	It giet echt oer.
I'm working tomorrow.	Ik wurkje moarn.
But here we can do something about it.	Mar hjir kinne wy ​​wat oan dwaan.
I've never heard of you before.	Ik haw noch noait fan dy heard.
It was a busy life in the big city.	It wie in drok libben yn de grutte stêd.
Easy for him to say.	Maklik foar him te sizzen.
Now this is the problem.	No is dit it probleem.
I'm not ready for that.	Ik bin der net klear foar.
She saw nothing else of him.	Se seach neat oars fan him.
He only wanted the best for himself.	Hy woe allinnich it bêste foar himsels.
Do the work.	Doch it wurk.
Well, that's it.	Goed, dat is it.
Someone she knows.	Immen dy't se ken.
I heard her once.	Ik hearde har ien kear.
That would not happen today.	Dat soe hjoed net barre.
That, of course, should not be the case.	Dat soe fansels net sa moatte.
The food is gone now.	It iten is no fuort.
I felt and feel nothing for her, to this day.	Ik fielde en fiel neat foar har, oant hjoed de dei.
Nobody really cared.	Nimmen hie it echt om.
You're going to tell them that.	Jo geane se dat fertelle.
I love it.	Ik hâld der fan.
Still pretty easy.	Noch frij maklik.
I was afraid to take a chance.	Ik wie bang om in kâns te nimmen.
Tonight it would be my bed.	Jûn soe it myn bêd wêze.
It is with many things.	It is mei in protte dingen.
I told her to look into it.	Ik fertelde har om der nei te sjen.
He will love me.	Hy sil my hâlde.
Whatever it was, well, not found.	Wat it ek woe, goed, net fûn.
That was only a few years ago.	Dat wie noch mar in pear jier lyn.
True.	Wier.
There will be things to do.	Der sille dingen te dwaan.
And now you want to go home.	En no wolle jo nei hûs.
He knew his wife very well.	Hy koe syn frou tige goed.
You say nothing.	Jo sizze neat.
I knew him, of course.	Ik koe him fansels.
All our money was gone.	Al ús jild wie fuort.
But whatever it is, it will not stop with you.	Mar wat it ek is, it sil net by jo ophâlde.
He could give it back to her.	Hy koe it har werom jaan.
But it is, and it does very well.	Mar it is, en it docht hiel goed.
Maybe they will come.	Miskien komme se wol.
I do not think this is true.	Ik tink net dat dit wier is.
I will do nothing.	Ik sil neat meitsje.
I love driving.	Ik hâld fan riden.
She obviously did not really want to see me.	Se woe my fansels net echt sjen.
But it was hard to tell.	Mar it wie dreech te fertellen.
Her parents did not like her.	Har âlden hiene har net leuk.
It will not happen.	It sil net barre.
It makes me really, really happy.	It makket my echt echt bliid.
We have to get to work tomorrow.	Wy moatte moarn oan it wurk.
He never asked himself what it was.	Hy frege him noait ôf wat it wie.
See you tomorrow.	Sjoch dy moarn.
I do not know how she did it.	Ik wit net hoe't se it dien hat.
I could not eat anything.	Ik koe neat ite.
You can do such a thing.	Jo kinne sa'n ding dwaan.
Of course, the truth is that nothing works for everyone.	Fansels is de wierheid dat neat foar elkenien wurket.
If you live there and do not like it, then go away.	As jo ​​​​dêr wenje en it net leuk fine, gean dan fuort.
This was an occasional thing.	Dit wie sa no en dan in ding.
That's all right.	Dat is hielendal goed.
It's up to you what you want.	It is oan jo wat jo wolle.
Her friends were many.	Har freonen wiene in protte.
I'm glad I did not live with her.	Ik bin bliid dat ik net by har wenje.
I did not know what to say.	Ik wist net wat ik sizze moast.
There is always more.	Der is altyd mear.
If not, then you do not.	As net, dan dogge jo net.
It makes me want to do more with my life.	It makket my wol mear dwaan mei myn libben.
I'm sorry I had to ask.	It spyt my dat ik freegje moast.
I think it's him.	Ik tink dat it him is.
He will never make it alive.	Hy sil it noait libben meitsje.
I wondered if she felt tired again.	Ik frege my ôf oft se har wer wurch fielde.
I liked that idea.	Ik fûn dat idee leuk.
No more than a few days.	Net mear as in pear dagen.
He did not say why, but the reason was clear.	Hy sei net wêrom, mar de reden wie dúdlik.
You make me happy.	Jo meitsje my bliid.
It's better to tell her nothing.	It is better om har neat te fertellen.
I hope to finish it soon.	Ik hoopje it gau ôf te meitsjen.
It was absolutely nothing.	It wie hielendal neat.
That, of course, is not entirely true.	Dat is fansels net hielendal wier.
Many things happened today.	In protte dingen barde hjoed.
His father became ill.	Syn heit waard siik.
It might not have even seen him.	It soe him miskien net iens sjoen hawwe.
All those people in the house.	Al dy minsken yn 'e hûs.
He knew it was going to happen.	Hy wist dat it barre soe.
He said he knew nothing about it.	Hy sei dat er der neat fan wist.
But the problem remained money.	Mar it probleem bleau jild.
He would not play.	Hy soe net spylje.
I am very happy with him.	Ik bin hiel bliid mei him.
Pay attention to my words, now.	Let op myn wurden, no.
He just would not.	Hy soe gewoan net.
He's old enough.	Hy is âld genôch.
I have the morning off.	Ik ha de moarn frij.
But they do not work for me.	Mar se dogge net foar my.
Please go here.	Gean hjir asjebleaft.
Let me ask now.	Lit my no freegje.
They would probably be better.	Se soene wierskynlik better wêze.
Of a kind.	Fan in soarte.
I want to talk to my girl.	Ik wol mei myn famke prate.
Do not try this at home.	Besykje dit net thús.
Glad to help.	Bliid om te helpen.
He was scared of me.	Hy wie bang foar my.
But he was so tired.	Mar hy wie sa wurch.
We could find a way.	Wy koene in manier fine.
The house is still there.	It hûs stiet der noch.
I really need to see it.	Ik moat it echt sjen.
It would have been nice.	It hie wol moai west.
She just looked sick.	Se seach der gewoan siik út.
Not sure what can be done.	Net wis wat kin dien wurde.
I thought you were different.	Ik tocht dat jo oars wiene.
The name of the place says it all.	De namme fan it plak seit it al.
One thing is what it is and not something else.	In ding is wat it is en net wat oars.
Nothing is given.	Der wurdt neat jûn.
But not for a car.	Mar net foar in auto.
I saw you.	Ik seach dy.
I will be here even if it does.	Ik sil hjir wêze sels as it docht.
I never looked back.	Ik seach noait werom.
That it is better than life.	Dat it better is as it libben.
I know it's early, but we have to go.	Ik wit dat it betiid is, mar wy moatte gean.
Well, here we are.	No, hjir binne wy.
Not a man's house.	Net in man syn hûs.
But we can say more.	Mar wy kinne mear sizze.
You will not believe this.	Jo sille dit net leauwe.
And he could.	En hy koe.
Get over it.	Lit it gean.
Or probably could not have.	Of koe wierskynlik net hawwe.
These people would have been much better off without me.	Dizze minsken hiene it folle better ôf west sûnder my.
They should not do that.	Dat moatte se net dwaan.
He could have done it easily, but he had a better idea.	Hy koe it maklik hawwe, mar hy hie in better idee.
Not one of us does, but we would love to.	Net ien fan ús docht, mar wy soene graach wolle.
I want to be the best.	Ik wol de bêste wêze.
I want them to know that.	Ik wol dat se dat witte.
Talk to you soon.	Mei dy prate.
Take it and go.	Nim it en gean.
What is ever seen is never seen.	Wat ea sjoen wurdt, wurdt nea sjoen.
She had made it.	Se hie it makke.
Here's another question.	Hjir is in oare fraach.
There it is for that.	Dêr is it der foar.
This is exactly what they did when the time came.	Dit is krekt wat se diene doe't de tiid kaam.
She took her husband.	Se naam har man.
It seems to me that we have a problem.	It liket my as hawwe wy in probleem.
Of course it does.	Fansels docht it wol.
Why did you not eat with us?	Wêrom bist net by ús oan it iten west?
There's not much in it.	Der sit net folle yn.
You know the little you can see.	Jo witte it bytsje dat jo sjen kinne.
I'm happy now.	Ik bin no bliid.
I have to get in there now.	Ik moat der no yn.
He loves to help.	Hy hâldt fan helpe.
I've never seen anything do what it does.	Ik haw noait wat sjoen dwaan wat it docht.
He was a child.	Hy wie in bern.
He even thought once.	Hy hat sels ien kear tocht.
We'll see what she has.	Wy sille sjen wat se hat.
It was made by humans.	It wie makke fan minsken.
She should not keep the dog in the house.	Se moat de hûn net yn 'e hûs hâlde.
There was something out there.	Der wie wat út.
Whatever your best job is, you do it.	Wat jo bêste wurk is, jo dogge it.
This was for the best.	Dit wie foar it bêste.
Then he would come for them.	Dan soe er foar har komme.
That may be true.	Dat kin wier wêze.
I'm waiting for him to say something.	Ik wachtsje oant er wat seit.
At first he saw nothing.	Earst seach er neat.
It's very difficult.	It is hiel dreech.
And we had no children.	En wy hiene gjin bern.
One with whom you can talk really easily.	Ien mei wa't jo echt maklik kinne prate.
It was fun though.	It wie wol leuk.
Mom had a lot of worries through him.	Mem hie in protte soargen troch him.
This has happened over and over again.	Dit is oer en wer bard.
Everything that happens is on me.	Alles wat bart is op my.
No one had seen her.	Nimmen hie har sjoen.
He can know nothing of this.	Hy kin hjir neat fan witte.
Never again.	Nea mear sa.
That's what I see today.	Dat sjoch ik hjoed.
He found none.	Hy fûn gjinien.
You just have to tell the truth.	Jo moatte gewoan de wierheid fertelle.
They can not see it.	Se kinne it net sjen.
They were interested at first.	Se wiene earst ynteressearre.
He must have seen something.	Hy hat wol wat sjoen.
Her family did not like that.	Dat mocht har famylje net.
They would have each other.	Se soene elkoar hawwe.
It's more than you say.	It is mear as jo sizze.
I'm home again.	Ik bin wer thús.
No one expected them to win.	Nimmen hie ferwachte dat se winne.
He keeps it out.	Hy hâldt it út.
Or so everyone felt differently.	Of sa fielde elkenien oars.
But you can not take him out of the house.	Mar jo kinne him net út 'e hûs nimme.
No more words left.	Gjin wurden mear oer.
In fact, it was not a bad idea.	Eins wie it gjin min idee.
They let you know.	Se litte jo witte.
Where it can not find them, it makes them.	Wêr't it se net kin fine, makket it har.
See how you eat.	Sjoch hoe't jo ite.
But they can and must.	Mar se kinne en moatte.
So it can be done.	Sa kin it dien wurde.
I found this the best.	Ik fûn dit it bêste.
He could not know it.	Hy koe it net witte.
The family went to the door. 	De famylje gie nei de doar. 
I have you of course.	Ik haw dy fansels.
That you come and look at them.	Dat jo komme en nei har sjen.
Must have.	Moat hawwe.
We want everyone to be very happy.	Wy wolle dat elkenien tige bliid is.
He loves us so much.	Hy hâldt sa folle fan ús.
Not much, really.	Net in protte, echt.
Can anyone tell me how to do this.	Kin immen my fertelle hoe't ik it dwaan moat.
I worked there every day.	Ik wurke dêr alle dagen.
I'm afraid she can do that.	Ik bin bang dat se dat kin.
We have to agree.	Wy moatte it iens wêze.
I was with a friend and her parents.	Ik wie mei in freon en har âlden.
Goes to the door.	Giet nei de doar.
That is not so different.	Dat is net sa oars.
I need to talk to my mom.	Ik moat mei myn mem prate.
Just one place.	Krekt ien plak.
All children should do it.	Alle bern moatte it dwaan.
I had never really done it of course.	Ik hie it noait echt dien fansels.
I've never been so scared in my life.	Ik bin yn myn libben noch noait sa bang west.
I give my word for that.	Ik jou dêr myn wurd foar.
Now you have to eat.	No moatte jo ite.
Feel free to come.	Fiel jo frij om te kommen.
A few years ago.	In pear jier lyn.
She looked as if she had never seen one before.	Se seach der nei as hie se noch noait ien sjoen.
Does anyone know for sure.	Wit immen it wis.
The more you can do, the better.	Hoe mear jo kinne dwaan, hoe better.
Then they will try to get you to buy them.	Dan sille se besykje om jo te krijen om se te keapjen.
This will let you know if they already have something.	Dit sil jo witte oft se al wat hawwe.
I am just as often happy as not.	Ik bin like faak bliid as net.
It just sat there.	It siet der mar.
He did not die.	Hy stoar net.
He said he just wanted to talk.	Hy sei dat er mar prate woe.
For one hour.	Foar ien oere.
Always have and always will.	Altyd hawwe en sil altyd.
He would love for you to go to him.	Hy soe graach wolle dat jo nei him geane.
I could talk to anyone.	Ik koe mei elkenien prate.
I do not believe them.	Ik leau se net.
Everyone wanted it that way.	Elkenien woe it sa.
If you have one or more good friends, talk to them.	As jo ​​​​ien of mear goede freonen hawwe, praat dan mei har.
I would not even wait to get something to eat.	Ik soe net iens wachtsje om wat te iten te krijen.
A man and a father.	In man en in heit.
It is not so.	It is net sa.
Of course he needed her.	Fansels hie er har nedich.
Can't get her back.	Kin se net werom krije.
Never came home.	Nea thús kaam.
There can be nothing more to it than that.	Der kin neat mear oan wêze as dat.
But it's not a job.	Mar it is gjin wurk.
Well, that does not matter.	No, dat makket neat út.
They need help.	Se hawwe help nedich.
What do they think they are doing?	Wat tinke se dat se dogge?
Also happy about it.	Dêr ek bliid fan.
What do they want us to do?	Wat wolle se dat wy dogge?
You need to be home.	Jo moatte thús wêze.
That really is not so much.	Dat is echt net sa folle.
That's enough for me.	Dat is my genôch.
I do not know the girl.	Ik ken it famke net.
That she will need.	Dat sil se nedich hawwe.
A good man no more.	In goed man net mear.
Praat mar!	Praat mar!
Not just you and me.	Net allinnich do en ik.
She's getting there.	Se komt der wol oan.
You know better than that.	Jo witte better as dat.
I had money.	Ik hie jild.
So many other things.	Sa folle oare dingen.
That time.	Dy tiid.
That was not really the question, so to speak.	Dat wie net echt de fraach, sa te sizzen.
I did not ask him why.	Ik haw him net frege wêrom.
Not sure we knew exactly how early we were talking.	Net wis dat wy krekt wisten hoe betiid wy prate.
I think it's probably too late.	Ik tink dat it wierskynlik te let is.
They do not have to spend all their money.	Se hoege net al har jild út te jaan.
But somehow we did.	Mar ien of oare manier diene wy.
I had always thought he was different.	Ik hie altyd tocht dat er oars wie.
It does not have to be this way.	It hoecht net sa te gean.
I just have to stop.	Ik moat gewoan ophâlde.
Home sweet home.	Lang om let thús.
He arrives at work late at night.	Hy komt fannacht te let op it wurk.
She could do nothing else.	Se koe neat oars.
Here is that.	Hjir is dat.
He does the good work.	Hy die goed wurk.
I hope she does not go.	Ik hoopje dat se net giet.
But he knew her plan would not work.	Mar hy wist dat har plan net wurkje soe.
I think it's more.	Ik tink dat it mear is.
The first was just something to do.	De earste wie gewoan wat te dwaan.
Your life is no different.	Jo libben is net oars.
But it was difficult.	Mar it wie dreech.
But this may not be good yet.	Mar dit kin noch net goed wêze.
Take this for granted.	Nim dit foar har.
And it started well.	En it begûn goed.
The father was another man.	De heit wie in oare man.
Everyone knows so much.	Elkenien wit safolle.
And she wanted it.	En se woe it.
This would never have happened.	Dit soe nea bard wêze.
And so he had.	En sa hie er.
He took us to dinner.	Hy naam ús mei nei iten.
Or maybe it is not.	Of miskien is it net.
So what? 	No en?
he says.	hy seit.
You need to know what they are doing just by reading their name.	Jo moatte witte wat se dogge gewoan troch har namme te lêzen.
Children are not good for me.	Bern binne net goed foar my.
That's what he told you and he does.	Dat hat er dy sein en dat docht er.
To me, my family and friends are everything.	Foar my binne myn famylje en freonen alles.
You know, you're just like my wife.	Jo witte, do bist krekt as myn frou.
He does not have to be.	Hy hoecht net te wêzen.
I think you did too.	Ik tink dat jo ek dien hawwe.
Not too many people know.	Net te folle minsken witte.
I was glad I had him.	Ik wie bliid dat ik him hie.
Once upon a time.	Ien kear ien.
Talk a little.	Praat in bytsje.
He knows there are not so many.	Hy wit dat der net safolle binne.
It's time to get things done.	It is tiid om dingen dien te krijen.
They were the best.	Se wiene de bêste.
I could see the people who loved it.	Ik koe de minsken sjen dy't der fan hâlde.
He would find that someone.	Hy soe dat immen fine.
All problems, that's it.	Alle problemen, dat is it.
But we know what has happened in the past.	Mar wy witte wat der yn it ferline bard is.
But that did not matter.	Mar dat hoegde net.
I'm worried about him.	Ik meitsje my soargen oer him.
He was actually wrong about that.	Hy wie dêr eins ferkeard oer.
I'm sorry I'm late.	It spyt my dat ik let bin.
He was scared of me.	Hy wie bang foar my.
You have your meeting.	Jo hawwe jo gearkomste.
It's very good for me.	It is hiel goed foar my.
I just want to be a couple right now.	Ik wol no krekt in pear wêze.
They are away from home.	Se binne fuort fan hûs.
Show and win, everything.	Lit sjen en winne, alles.
Here is a picture of him.	Hjir is in foto fan him.
No one should be in the latter.	Nimmen soe yn 'e lêste wêze moatte.
He could not see them.	Hy koe se net sjen.
You get your money back.	Jo krije jo jild werom.
Please let me know.	Lit it my asjebleaft witte.
I love you very much.	Ik hâld tige fan dy.
I could eat that at once, he thought to himself.	Dat koe ik wol yn ien kear ite, tocht er by himsels.
Or he comes back.	Of hy komt werom.
She would be with her husband.	Se soe by har man wêze.
Well, it does not matter to me in one way or another.	No, makket my neat út op ien of oare manier.
Try it, you will be surprised.	Besykje it, jo sille ferrast wurde.
They were ready to leave.	Se wiene ree om fuort te gean.
Go back to work.	Gean werom oan it wurk.
They worry.	Se meitsje har soargen.
It was the best place to be.	It wie it bêste plak om te wêzen.
I took them.	Ik naam se.
No matter how different he looked.	Hoe oars hy ek like.
We need to get a new car.	Wy moatte in nije auto krije.
Not to her.	Net oan har.
He knew it now.	Hy wist it no.
I was here first!	Ik wie hjir earst!
This has.	Dit hat.
Nothing but friends.	Neat oars as freonen.
Until that was exactly what happened.	Oant dat wie krekt wat barde.
There is no other reason.	D'r is gjin oare reden.
I did nothing!	Ik ha neat dien!
They will not speak if the teacher does.	Se sille net prate as de learaar dat docht.
He did so much more than was asked.	Hy die safolle mear as frege waard.
Once she had done that, she could no longer.	Doe't se dat dien hie, koe se net mear.
And they did not have much.	En dat hiene se net folle.
My father came to us.	Myn heit kaam by ús.
That would have been different.	Dat hie oars west.
I was just mad at you.	Ik wie gewoan lilk op dy.
Well with that being said.	No mei dat sein.
we can not go.	wy kinne net gean.
But if she did.	Mar as se it die.
None of his friends.	Gjin fan syn freonen.
Both were true.	Beide wiene wier.
He asked me.	Hy frege my.
We can do nothing.	Wy kinne neat dwaan.
They are the past.	Se binne it ferline.
The bad kind.	De minne soarte.
We'll just do it if we have not seen it.	Wy sille gewoan dwaan as wy it net sjoen hawwe.
You never knew.	Jo wisten noait.
It's that time of year again.	It is wer dy tiid fan it jier.
That we had never seen.	Dat hiene wy ​​nea sjoen.
He will do nothing more than make me happy.	Hy sil neat mear dwaan as my bliid meitsje.
But she would.	Mar se soe.
It hurt, it really hurt me.	It die sear, it die my echt sear.
He has a lot to tell her.	Hy hat har in protte te sizzen.
I know this is not happening now, but the thoughts are there.	Ik wit dat dit no net bart, mar de gedachten binne der.
To her.	Oant har.
You can not be here without.	Jo kinne hjir net sûnder wêze.
There was so much to see!	Der wie safolle te sjen!
Let me know what you think.	Lit my witte wat jo fine.
To the other.	Oan de oare.
It works too well to be just that.	It wurket te goed om krekt dat te wêzen.
My life goes through something of that sort.	Myn libben giet troch wat fan dat soarte.
And one by one we enter the room.	En ien foar ien geane wy ​​de keamer yn.
See you tomorrow!.	Sjoch dy moarn!.
He could talk to anyone.	Hy koe mei elkenien prate.
I'm really good.	Ik bin echt goed.
I do not want you back.	Ik wol dy net werom.
It is the question of being only one thing.	It is de fraach om mar ien ding te wêzen.
Such beautiful hair.	Sa'n moai hier.
All the way through.	De hiele wei troch.
Take everything off.	Nim alles ôf.
I did not say we would.	Ik sei net dat wy soene.
It would not be nice.	It soe net moai wurde.
No word from you.	Gjin wurd fan dy.
Not around me.	Net om my.
I can talk to him really well now.	Ik kin no echt goed mei him prate.
Are you with us ?.	Binne jo by ús?.
Wait and see !.	Wachtsje en sjoch!.
Really felt and seen.	Echt fielde en sjoen.
That's up to him.	Dat is oan him.
I do that a lot.	Ik doch dat in protte.
He does a work in you.	Hy docht in wurk yn dy.
I'm coming.	Ik kom der oan.
You would, of course.	Jo soene, fansels.
And both are now in great demand.	En beide binne no tige yn fraach.
I've been away too long.	Ik bin te lang fuort west.
I looked at the money again.	Ik seach wer nei it jild.
I can handle that.	Dat kin ik wol oan.
She should not see that we are here.	Se moat net sjen dat wy hjir binne.
The young man looked tired.	De jonge man seach wurch.
That's what he does now.	Dat docht er no.
My kids are real.	Myn bern binne echt.
He has many friends.	Hy hat in protte freonen.
I had never seen him like this before.	Ik hie him noch noait sa sjoen.
I was fine with that.	Ik wie der goed mei.
We'm talking about it.	Wy prate it oer.
That's been the case since we were kids.	Dat is al sa sûnt wy bern wiene.
What am I?	Wat is ik.
There is a chance he could win.	Der is in kâns dat hy winne koe.
Both were good.	Beide wie goed.
More of us, the better.	Mear fan ús, hoe better.
Very few people work there.	Hiel pear minsken wurkje dêr.
There are more of them this time.	Der binne dizze kear mear fan.
With that said, it was a good movie.	Mei dat sein, it wie in goede film.
He was on his own, they said.	Hy wie op himsels, seine se.
It was not his place.	It wie net syn plak.
I did it.	Ik haw it dien.
I'm going back home.	Ik gean werom nei hûs.
There was nothing to do if they take.	Der wie neat te dwaan as se nimme.
He had no idea what to think of her.	Hy hie gjin idee wat er fan har tinke moast.
I've never been scared in my life.	Ik haw yn myn libben noait bang west.
We do not even have money to buy food.	Wy ha sels gjin jild om iten te keapjen.
I can do nothing to her.	Ik kin neat oan har dwaan.
They just live across the road.	Se wenje gewoan oer de wei.
They do not want me for nothing.	Se wolle my net foar neat.
It was all that was needed.	It wie alles wat nedich wie.
No major issues.	Gjin grutte problemen.
Same as school.	Itselde as skoalle.
We need to find it.	Wy moatte it fine.
Of course you will love it.	Fansels sille jo hâlde.
And each other.	En elkoar.
There are so many of him.	Der binne safolle fan him.
I do not know why it is not, but it is not.	Ik wit net wêrom it net is, mar it is it net.
Who knows what.	Wa wit wat.
Give it your best.	Jou it dyn bêste.
That's probably good for now.	Dat is wierskynlik goed foar no.
We just do not.	Wy gewoan net.
That's not the case.	Sa giet it net.
They had no plan.	Se hiene gjin plan.
There was never anyone else.	Der wie noait ien oars.
I told no one.	Ik fertelde nimmen.
We all want more.	Wy wolle allegear mear.
He will take care of you.	Hy sil foar dy soargje.
This school is only open a few days.	Dizze skoalle is mar in pear dagen iepen.
I love the two together.	Ik hâld fan de twa tegearre.
If not, then let them go.	Sa net, lit har dan gean.
I came back to get some help.	Ik kaam werom om wat help te krijen.
Long and easy.	Lang om let.
They know what they know.	Se witte wat se witte.
She did not want to see it.	Se woe it net sjen.
I will be there.	Ik sil der wêze.
Then he does it.	Dan docht er it.
They do not speak.	Se prate net.
Was just.	Wie gewoan.
Many people have tried.	In protte minsken hawwe besocht.
She had not thought of much else.	Se hie oan net folle oars tocht.
He was not good.	Hy wie net goed.
So she got him at her car too.	Sa krige se him ek by har auto.
She made it ready.	Se makke it klear.
They show or show things.	Se litte dingen sjen of sjen.
He shows me.	Hy lit my sjen.
But could do nothing.	Mar koe neat dwaan.
I know what it's like.	Ik wit hoe't it is.
I talked to people who were there that day.	Ik haw praat mei minsken dy't der dy dei wiene.
But do not think that everyone here is the same as you.	Mar tink net dat elkenien hjir itselde is as jo.
He was not ready to see anyone.	Hy wie net ree om immen te sjen.
I still know.	Ik wit noch.
It would have been too much, too soon.	It soe te folle west hawwe, te gau.
What works for you works for you.	Wat foar jo wurket, wurket foar jo.
There is no place to come back.	Der is gjin plak om werom te kommen.
She just came back.	Se kaam net werom.
People will have no problems with it.	Minsken sille der gjin problemen mei hawwe.
People need more friends, everyone needs more friends.	Minsken hawwe mear freonen nedich, elkenien hat mear freonen nedich.
It's not a problem.	It is gjin probleem.
Somehow the same thing comes out.	Op ien of oare manier komt it itselde út.
That life is gone.	Dat libben is fuort.
The police got it for him.	De plysje krige it foar him.
Watch carefully, or you will get it wrong.	Sjoch foarsichtich, of jo krije it ferkeard.
Just my name.	Krekt myn namme.
He looks hurt, then angry.	Hy sjocht sear, dan lilk.
This could do it.	Dit koe it dwaan.
I feel this.	Ik fiel dit.
Or something of why.	Of wat fan wêrom.
I will not do it again.	Ik sil it net wer dwaan.
I do not want.	Ik wol net.
It's him.	It is hy.
My father could not believe it.	Myn heit koe it net leauwe.
It seemed like it was kind of.	It like as wie it soarte fan.
I have to keep it.	Ik moat it hâlde.
I thought he was coming back.	Ik tocht dat er werom kaam.
But not like this.	Mar net as dizze.
He says he's happy.	Hy seit dat er bliid is.
He had heard his name.	Hy hie syn namme heard.
That did not seem to him either.	Dat like him ek net.
This always happens when you are late.	Dit bart altyd as jo te let binne.
He could not even speak.	Hy koe net iens prate.
I was no different.	Ik wie net oars.
However, he did not expect to find her.	Hoe dan ek, hy ferwachte har net te finen.
They may well be.	Se kinne wol wêze.
He did not say much.	Hy sei net folle.
I thought he had.	Ik tocht dat hy hie.
And now it was over and over.	En no wie it oer en.
I need some help.	Ik haw wat help nedich.
I wanted to talk more.	Ik woe mear prate.
We would do it.	Wy soene it dwaan.
He wasn't quite sure.	Hy wie der net hielendal wis fan.
I should have known they were friends.	Ik hie witte moatten dat se freonen wiene.
It says they only had two children.	It seit dat se mar twa bern hiene.
Why are you over there then.	Wêrom binne jo der dan oer.
Or even if he had one.	Of sels as er ien hie.
If you want to be.	As jo ​​wolle wêze.
We do not know for sure.	Wy witte it net wis.
She would make it home.	Se soe it thús meitsje.
To me, there are no friends.	Foar my binne d'r gjin freonen.
Really, it's a little worrying.	Echt, it is in bytsje soargen.
I know where he is all the time.	Ik wit wêr't hy is de hiele tiid.
They were here too long.	Se wiene hjir te lang.
She never told me who.	Se nea ferteld my wa.
Enough of that then.	Genôch fan dat dan.
This pair has both.	Dit pear hat beide.
I hope this is so.	Ik hoopje dat dit sa is.
But she did not want to.	Mar se woe net.
He had to see the truth.	Hy moast de wierheid sjen.
He was now another man.	Hy wie no in oare man.
How tired.	Wat wurch.
It was a beautiful place.	It wie in moai plak.
I was with children with her.	Ik wie mei bern by har.
Nobody cares what you think.	Nimmen makket it út wat jo tinke.
Two or three years, he said.	Twa of trije jier, sei er.
Please come back and let me know how you are doing.	Kom asjebleaft werom en lit my witte hoe't it mei jo giet.
I should have thought of that too.	Ik hie der ek oan tinke moatten.
It looked good, he felt.	It seach der goed út, fielde er.
It was telling her.	It wie har fertellen.
I feel really good.	Ik fiel my echt goed.
And he knew they would.	En hy wist dat se soene.
I saw it happen.	Ik seach it barre.
I had to pay them for it.	Ik moast se betelje foar it.
He does it so well.	Hy docht it sa goed.
Let me play it.	Lit my spylje it.
But it's my truth, exactly.	Mar it is myn wierheid, krekt.
I've never been, not really.	Ik ha noait west, net echt.
This time is no different.	Dizze kear is net oars.
It's the truth, if you just want to see it.	It is de wierheid, as jo gewoan it wolle sjen.
But so tell people where they can find out more about you.	Mar sa fertel minsken wêr't se kinne fine út mear oer dy.
She could not think of that.	Dêr koe se net oan tinke.
And well I speak.	En goed praat ek.
It's time to take it back.	It is tiid om it werom te nimmen.
But this belief does not make it true.	Mar dit leauwe makket it net wier.
She knows she has to tell him everything.	Se wit dat se him alles fertelle moat.
We're only going to the movie!	Wy geane allinnich nei de film!
She was worried.	Se wie soargen.
Decided to keep a few better.	Besletten om in pear bettere te hâlden.
He has a lot to do.	Hy hat in protte te dwaan.
He's a really good man.	Hy is in echt goede man.
I found my truth.	Ik fûn myn wierheid.
They keep you going.	Se hâlde dy troch.
I was the next person.	Ik wie de folgjende persoan.
This is first.	Dit is earst.
No one knows how much.	Nimmen wit hoefolle.
That would never, ever happen today.	Dat soe hjoed noait, ea barre.
He was beautiful.	Hy wie moai.
She was the only one who did not.	Se wie de iennichste dy't net die.
Not that he felt them.	Net dat er se fielde.
Then you will see.	Dan sille jo sjen.
Three of us is not enough to make a new city.	Trije fan ús is net genôch om in nije stêd te meitsjen.
It's still early.	It is noch betiid.
You started all this.	Jo begûn dit alles.
Here is one way to do it.	Hjir is ien manier om it te dwaan.
You can not try to do things.	Jo kinne net besykje dingen te dwaan.
Come into me.	Kom yn my.
I'm the new guy.	Ik bin de nije keardel.
I look at the door.	Ik sjoch nei de doar.
Wait, that's not good.	Wachtsje, dat is net goed.
And he is him.	En hy is him.
Never heard of it, never seen it.	Nea heard fan it, nea sjoen it.
I knew him well.	Ik koe him goed.
Things are coming up soon.	Dingen komme gau op.
Do not take it out on me.	Nim it my net út.
I did what he said.	Ik die wat er sei.
We know this is not for you.	Wy witte dat dit net jo dwaan is.
He certainly goes all or nothing.	Hy giet wis alles of neat.
She had expected problems.	Se hie problemen ferwachte.
No one can tell me what's wrong with me.	Nimmen kin my fertelle wat der mei my is.
That's not it.	Dat is it net.
It did not seem like a real thing.	It like net in echt ding.
It will not work.	It sil net wurkje.
Everything is it, and it is everything.	Alles is it, en it is alles.
But this was not done.	Mar dit waard net dien.
Let him go, please.	Lit him gean, asjebleaft.
There is really nothing else to this.	D'r is echt neat oars oan dit.
We'll let you go home.	Wy litte jo nei hûs gean.
We did it once.	Wy hawwe it ien kear dien.
And he is here with us.	En hy is hjir by ús.
If anything happens, let me know.	As der wat bart, lit it my witte.
It doesn 't matter,' he said.	It makket neat út,' sei er.
She had nothing else on.	Se hie neat oars oan.
They now know where we are.	Se witte no wêr't wy binne.
It was good though.	It wie wol goed.
She lives with him.	Se wennet by him.
We hope to be back with more of our family.	Wy hoopje werom te wêzen mei mear fan ús famylje.
I like to make friends.	Ik wol graach freonen meitsje.
I know they have two children.	Ik wit dat se twa bern hawwe.
If you did, you would pay.	As jo ​​​​diene, soene jo betelje.
There's one left.	Der is ien oer.
Do not touch it.	Kom der net oan.
It just happened.	It is gewoan wat bard.
It's run here.	It wurdt hjir rûn.
This was not the same.	Dit wie net itselde.
I will not agree with you tomorrow.	Ik sil moarn net iens mei dy prate.
I had nothing in my name.	Ik hie neat op myn namme.
One thing was for sure.	Ien ding wie wol wis.
This was it, this was his great opportunity.	Dit wie it, dit wie syn grutte kâns.
The first few days she did not want to eat anything.	De earste dagen woe se neat ite.
I had never been there before.	Ik hie der noch nea earder by west.
It was really beautiful.	It wie echt moai.
But we have to.	Mar wy moatte.
Maybe again.	Miskien wer.
We are not who we were.	Wy binne net wa't wy wiene.
It was clear she was tired.	It wie dúdlik dat se wurch wie.
There comes one last time, one last chance.	Der komt in lêste kear, in lêste kâns.
It's been a long time since we met.	It is al lang lyn dat wy moete hawwe.
Now no, never never, she said.	No net, nea nea, sei se.
It can not.	It kin net.
I was afraid of him and of me.	Ik wie bang foar him en foar my.
You can do anything you want.	Jo kinne alles dwaan wat jo wolle.
But she never really did it.	Mar se hat it noait echt dien.
But that's done.	Mar dat is klear.
Of course, you can just get it wrong.	Fansels kinne jo it gewoan ferkeard krije.
They could not find it.	Se koene it net fine.
I asked for her name.	Ik frege om har namme.
I love us together.	Ik hâld fan ús tegearre.
Let us know if you need anything.	Lit it ús witte as jo wat nedich binne.
He can not do without me.	Hy kin der net sûnder my yn.
All of them.	Elkenien.
But she did not see it.	Mar se seach it net.
I'm not sure of the size.	Ik bin net wis fan de grutte.
She did not know if her husband would return.	Se wist net oft har man werom soe.
He can do nothing wrong.	Hy kin neat min dwaan.
I let you go.	Ik lit dy gean.
Today she left work early.	Hjoed gie se betiid út it wurk.
I thought quickly.	tocht ik gau.
And he will go.	En hy sil gean.
He is happy with it.	Hy is der bliid mei.
It occurred to him that he should not do this.	It kaam him op dat er dit net dwaan moast.
I'm that woman.	Ik bin dy frou.
I will not be in town.	Ik sil net yn 'e stêd wêze.
The child was fine.	It bern wie goed.
Here was nothing.	Hjir wie neat.
I wait.	Ik wachtsje.
I think of you too.	Ik tink ek oan dy.
Or they should.	Of se moatte.
To talk about what we love.	Om te praten oer wat wy hâlde.
My wife does it better.	Myn frou docht it better.
Come in.	Kom der yn.
I assume here that it would.	Ik nim hjir oan dat it soe.
That works much, much better.	Dat wurket folle, folle better.
The party was poorly attended.	It feest waard min besocht.
You had a lot of help.	Jo hiene in protte help.
I was waiting for it.	Ik wachte der op.
It has come to him now.	It is him no kommen.
You just do not know.	Jo witte it gewoan net.
I'm not afraid of him.	Ik bin net bang foar him.
I never really looked at him.	Ik seach noait echt nei him.
So he got money.	Sa krige er jild.
It's one of me.	It is ien fan my.
It was given to him.	It waard him jûn.
You can believe whatever you want.	Jo kinne leauwe wat jo wolle.
She would hurt him.	Se soe him wol sear dwaan.
She knows it's her job here.	Se wit dat it hjir har wurk is.
I wish for some reason.	Ik winskje om ien of oare reden.
He does not like.	Hy hâldt net fan.
You have to do it one more time.	Jo moatte it noch ien kear dwaan.
And we will take care of these young children.	En wy sille soargje foar dizze jonge bern.
There does not have to be anyone.	Der hoecht gjinien te wêzen.
Looks good still.	Sjocht der noch goed út.
We're sick.	Wy binne siik.
Do not open the door for anyone.	Doch de doar foar gjinien iepen.
You told me.	Do hast my sein.
He never got sick.	Hy is nea siik wurden.
You're just getting in my way.	Do bist my gewoan yn 'e wei.
The time was up, she thought.	De tiid wie der op, tocht se.
I do not know what could happen.	Ik wit net wat der barre kin.
She looked away, but thought better of it.	Se seach fuort, mar tocht der better oer.
She's a good friend of mine.	Se is in goede freon fan my.
It's not too late yet.	It is noch net te let.
But she still had to give him a chance.	Mar se moast him noch in kâns jaan.
There it is.	Dêr is it .
They make a lot and a lot of money.	Se meitsje in protte en in protte jild.
This was a job.	Dit wie in baan.
More than likely they would not.	Mear dan wierskynlik soene se net.
But the truth is very different.	Mar de wierheid is hiel oars.
Anyway.	Hoe dan ek wol.
He liked the life he had, and he was good at it.	Hy mocht it libben dat er hie, en hy wie der goed yn.
That place also had no name.	Dat plak hie ek gjin namme.
I needed water.	Ik hie wetter nedich.
I have so much.	Ik haw safolle.
But now was not the time.	Mar no wie net de tiid.
I felt it.	Ik fielde it.
It was my everything.	It wie myn alles.
That she can be anyone she wants to be.	Dat se elkenien wêze kin dy't se wêze wol.
It did not seem necessary.	It like net nedich.
I want you to do well in your life.	Ik wol dat jo it goed dogge yn jo libben.
Neither of us wanted to stop anymore.	Net ien fan ús woe mear ophâlde.
Do not do this thing.	Doch dit ding net.
It's good to have friends who are good to you.	It is goed om freonen te hawwen dy't goed foar jo binne.
For much the same reason.	Foar folle deselde reden.
But this is not where the idea came from.	Mar dit is net wêr't it idee wei kaam.
Maybe he just did.	Miskien die er net.
Now we have to find a way.	No moatte wy in manier fine.
They will find you.	Se sille jo fine.
Otherwise, wait for us.	Oars, wachtsje op ús.
What it is and what it does.	Wat it is en wat it docht.
Your work needs to be done and it needs to be ready.	Jo wurk moat dien wurde en it moat klear wêze.
There goes a car.	Dêr giet in auto.
One of us will.	Ien fan ús sil.
They could pretty much do whatever they wanted.	Se koene moai dwaan wat se wolle.
Or can they.	Of kinne se.
Would love to know what it is.	Wol graach witte wat it is.
If that works.	As dat wurket.
It would be seen as another size.	It soe sjoen wurde as in oare grutte.
He's glad he has something to do.	Hy is bliid dat er wat te dwaan hat.
That kind of thing is for other people.	Dat soarte ding is foar oare minsken.
It may have been.	It kin west hawwe.
We had made money, but no friends.	Wy hiene jild makke, mar gjin freonen.
I am happy with his work.	Ik bin bliid mei syn wurk.
But do not be afraid.	Mar wês net bang.
Also, she was sick a lot of the time.	Ek wie se in protte fan 'e tiid siik.
Not too late for me, though.	Net te let foar my, dat wol.
The truth was that it had been waiting.	De wierheid wie dat it wachte hie.
I made it and took it to work and everyone liked it.	Ik makke it en naam it oan it wurk en elkenien fûn it leuk.
We have had this a few times.	Wy hawwe dit in pear kear hân.
But it is not likely.	Mar it is net wierskynlik.
He did not look at me either.	Hy seach ek net nei my.
Please wait for me here.	Wachtsje asjebleaft hjir op my.
It's exactly how it is.	It is krekt hoe it is.
It was so good of you to come.	It wie sa goed fan jo te kommen.
Back to this.	Werom nei dit.
Make a few.	Meitsje in pear.
That I want to win one day.	Dat wol ik ien dei winne.
Always, but what should this do.	Altyd, mar wat moat dit dwaan.
It works.	It wurket.
Let him try.	Lit him besykje.
We can help !.	Wy kinne helpe!.
You can go better, she said.	Jo kinne better gean, sei se.
I think of her every day.	Ik tink alle dagen oan har.
Time was money, and people had a lot of work to do.	Tiid wie jild, en minsken hiene in protte wurk te dwaan.
She kept looking at me.	Se bleau nei my sjen.
You never know who will do what.	Jo witte noait wa't wat sil dwaan.
I just knew the man.	Ik koe krekt de man.
He clearly did not know where he was.	Hy wist dúdlik net wêr't er wie.
For one, she's really good at what she does.	Foar ien is se echt goed yn wat se docht.
He saw me coming to him.	Hy seach my by him kommen.
Nothing and no one ever remained the same.	Neat en nimmen bleau ea itselde.
You can not do both.	Jo kinne net beide dwaan.
careful!	foarsichtich!
Okay, come in, come in.	Goed, kom yn, kom yn.
It's good to see you.	It is goed om dy te sjen.
But she knows who did it.	Mar se wit wa't it dien hat.
It just goes on and on.	It giet gewoan troch en troch.
They are not there.	Se binne der net.
And there was reason for that.	En dêr wie reden foar.
I do not come here often.	Ik kom hjir net faak.
You better believe it.	Jo kinne it better leauwe.
He did not think it too much.	Hy tocht it net te folle.
Nobody does that.	Nimmen docht dat.
I've been here too long.	Ik bin hjir te lang west.
There it was.	Dêr wie it.
It is not difficult to talk.	It is net dreech praat.
I'm not sure why this is.	Ik bin der net wis fan wêrom dit is.
But we can not and.	Mar wy kinne net en.
Then a month.	Dan in moanne.
Maybe it's just a few.	Miskien is it mar in pear.
It really is not a problem.	It is echt gjin probleem.
There has been a lot to see.	Der hat in protte te sjen west.
Maybe in another movie.	Miskien yn in oare film.
And walked to it.	En rûn der nei ta.
You tell us about you.	Jo fertelle ús oer dy.
Time was running out.	De tiid rûn út.
We want to know what our problems are.	Wy wolle witte wat ús problemen binne.
Probably is different.	Wierskynlik is oars.
Was not eating.	Wie net iten.
And it makes up for it.	En it makket ta.
A lot happens in there.	Der bart in protte yn.
All the way.	De hiele hiele wei.
She's getting over it.	Se komt der wol oer.
I came to him.	Ik kaam by him.
He never had trouble finding things he wanted.	Hy hie noait problemen om dingen te finen dy't hy woe.
I do not believe that yet.	Dat leau ik noch net.
That does not concern me.	Dat giet my net oan.
This is what will probably happen next.	Dit is wat nei alle gedachten sil barre.
In a way, we make up for it.	Op in manier meitsje wy ús derop ta.
I can not exactly think.	Ik kin net krekt tinke.
I did not know at first who he was.	Ik wist earst net wa't er wie.
But he might like it.	Mar hy kin it wol leuk fine.
To this day, they did not know it.	Oant hjoed de dei wisten se it noch net.
I'm worried about you.	Ik meitsje my soargen om dy.
We were friends.	Wy wiene freonen.
I said something, he said something.	Ik sei wat, hy sei wat.
We had seen enough after the first day.	Wy hiene nei de earste dei genôch sjoen.
No one stayed late.	Nimmen bleau let.
I do not feel it.	Ik fiel it net.
I'm just going home.	Ik gean mar nei hûs.
asked the boy.	frege de jonge ôf.
Neither did the girl.	It famke ek net.
We can do this together.	Wy kinne dit tegearre.
So we do as much as we can.	Sa dogge wy safolle as wy kinne.
Who knows.	Wa wit.
This, not so much.	Dit, net sa folle.
Or so it seemed.	Of sa like it.
Everyone had a question, wanted this or that.	Elkenien hie in fraach, woe dit of dat.
I will not let him hurt again.	Ik lit him net wer sear dwaan.
Just looked around.	Seach der mar yn om.
He does not see that.	Dat sjocht er net.
But they were there.	Mar se wiene der.
I just wanted a little bit of your time.	Ik woe mar in bytsje fan dyn tiid.
I feel kind of the same way.	Ik fiel sa'n bytsje deselde manier.
Will look into it tomorrow.	Sil der moarn nei sjen.
It was as if we did not agree.	It wie as wiene wy ​​der net iens.
And now, away.	En no, fuort.
I'm not interested.	Ik bin net ynteressearre.
Everyone knows that will never happen.	Elkenien wit dat sil nea barre.
I did that.	Dat haw ik dien.
We're here for the same reason, that's pretty clear.	Wy binne hjir foar deselde reden, dat is frij dúdlik.
Someone was waiting for us to come out.	Immen wachte op ús om út te kommen.
Time to get out of her life.	Tiid om út har libben te kommen.
Even for work.	Sels foar wurk.
That's for sure.	Dat is wis.
It was his job.	It wie syn wurk.
Go do it.	Gean mar dwaan.
It was just.	It wie gewoan.
I do not want to agree.	Ik wol net iens.
Everyone loves him.	Elkenien hâldt fan him.
They may know even more than we do.	Se kinne miskien noch mear witte as wy.
That can happen, too.	Dat kin ek wol.
I never finished the latter.	Ik ha de lêste noait klear.
It has always been us.	It hat ús altyd west.
She was very easy to read.	Se wie heul maklik te lêzen.
Had to be very careful there.	Moast dêr tige foarsichtich wêze.
They could do it.	Se koene dit dwaan.
She knows what happened to me.	Se wit wat my bard is.
I see so much of me in her as a mother.	Ik sjoch safolle fan my yn har as mem.
They obviously do not like it.	Se fine it fansels net leuk.
He's in a bad way.	Hy is yn in minne manier.
There it was again.	Dêr wie it wer.
Maybe something really happens tonight.	Miskien bart der fannacht echt wat.
He came into my office.	Hy kaam yn myn kantoar.
He was still looking at her.	Hy seach noch nei har.
This was different.	Dit wie oars.
I can see nothing but.	Ik kin neat oars as sjen.
They are just.	Se binne gewoan.
You have the whole truth and nothing but the truth about it.	Jo hawwe de hiele wierheid en neat oars as de wierheid oer.
But he would not have told anyone.	Mar hy soe it oan gjinien sein hawwe.
Now you need to do something about it.	No moatte jo wat oan him dwaan.
That's where it comes from.	Dêr komt it wei.
Not even for you know who.	Net iens foar jo witte wa.
This has never been done.	Dit is nea dien.
They could not do otherwise.	Se koene net oars.
But the police did.	Mar de plysje die.
Nobody does.	Gjinien docht.
I needed her myself.	Ik hie har sels nedich.
Do what you do.	Doch wat jo dogge.
With the book open, he began to read.	Mei it boek iepen begûn er te lêzen.
It was not hard to do.	It wie net dreech om te dwaan.
Do this carefully.	Doch dit foarsichtich.
He arrived in town about three months before that evening.	Hy kaam sa'n trije moanne foar dy jûn yn 'e stêd.
And last year one.	En ferline jier ien.
And for too long.	En foar te lang.
We never had a reason.	Wy hiene nea in reden.
He said he would see what he could find.	Hy sei dat er sjen soe wat er fine koe.
Make this life better.	Meitsje dit libben better.
That's how it should be.	Sa moat it wêze.
I saw so much.	Ik seach safolle.
He thought nothing of it.	Hy tocht der neat fan.
Om, om, om.	Om, om, om.
Not by anyone.	Net troch immen.
I no longer know if that is true or not.	Ik wit net mear oft dat wier is of net.
I'm very good at that.	Dêr bin ik hiel goed yn.
It must be here.	It moat hjir wêze.
I knew it would come in handy.	Ik wist dat it wol goed komme soe.
Do you think that you will come again next year?	Tinke jo dat jo takom jier wer komme?
He knows it, they know it.	Hy wit it, se witte it.
You're not off the job.	Jo binne net fan 'e baan.
I saw us.	Ik seach ús.
She should know better.	Se soe better witte moatte.
I have absolutely no idea how it happened.	Ik ha hielendal gjin idee hoe't it bard is.
I had a lot to do.	Ik hie in protte te dwaan.
But it will not stop.	Mar it sil net ophâlde.
It does not have to be right now.	It hoecht net no krekt te wêzen.
They just want their kids back.	Se wolle gewoan har bern werom.
I wanted to be free.	Ik woe frij wêze.
You work again.	Jo wurkje wer.
I can not seem to get anything at work.	Ik kin net lykje neat oan it wurk te krijen.
But he had better not.	Mar hy hie better net.
We will not talk about it.	Wy sille der net oer prate.
I know these things.	Ik wit dizze dingen.
I thought he did.	Ik tocht dat hy it die.
Her husband set it up.	Har man sette it op.
I will try to make this clear.	Ik sil besykje dit dúdlik te meitsjen.
Have you tried them ?.	Hawwe jo se besocht?.
I was all three.	Ik wie alle trije.
It's not fun then.	It is dan net leuk.
They had both gone to school together.	Se wiene beide tegearre nei skoalle gien.
Or not at all.	Of net hielendal.
Or he's just done.	Of hy is gewoan dien.
I never knew what he saw in her.	Ik wist noait wat er yn har seach.
They will find you wherever you go.	Se sille jo fine wêr't jo ek hinne geane.
That is not true.	Dat is net wier.
But it was not done.	Mar it wie net dien.
He just came to her.	Hy kaam net by har.
Just knew what the said.	Wist net wat se die.
I thought we could both go.	Ik tocht dat wy beide gean koene.
And, boy, are you always wrong.	En, jonge, bist altyd ferkeard.
You do not want the truth.	Jo wolle de wierheid net.
But they would not.	Mar se soene net.
That had happened before.	Dat wie earder bard.
He is here every day at work.	Hy is hjir alle dagen oan it wurk.
She would not let it go.	Se soe it net litte litte.
I was wondering if you knew any way.	Ik frege my ôf oft jo in manier wisten.
And they did it well, it was fun to watch.	En se diene it goed, it wie leuk om te sjen.
Let me go, please.	Lit my gean, asjebleaft.
That happened too.	Dat is ek bard.
So it was with me.	Sa wie it mei my.
Let him think it.	Lit him it tinke.
I just wanted to go to a movie.	Ik woe gewoan nei in film.
It was so good.	It wie sa goed.
You're as much a child as ever.	Do bist safolle in bern as oait.
I have worked hard this year.	Ik haw dit jier hurd wurke.
Tell no one, not even my father.	Fertel it nimmen, net iens myn heit.
She had enough to say about everything.	Se hie oer alles genôch te sizzen.
Just a few months.	Krekt in pear moanne.
It had never done that before.	Dat hie it noch nea dien.
You have it in you.	Jo hawwe it yn jo.
It was very difficult.	It wie tige dreech.
She does not think so.	Dat tinkt se net.
I should do the same.	Dat soe ik ek dwaan moatte.
I just do not.	Ik krekt net.
It's about what we do here.	It giet om wat wy hjir dogge.
It scared me.	It makke my bang.
I have to get out of here.	Ik moat hjir wei.
I approached her.	Ik kaam nei har ta.
It was really fun for him.	It wie echt leuk foar him.
Here's some more.	Hjir wat mear.
Just stay in.	Gewoan yn bliuwe.
Is that too much to ask ?.	Is dat te folle frege?.
But he did not.	Mar dat die er net.
I believe with you.	Ik leau mei dy.
Not much, like it.	Net folle, like it.
I'll get sick here.	Ik sil hjir siik wurde.
It was not likely to be around here.	It wie hjir net wierskynlik om.
I try and see the best in everything.	Ik besykje en sjoch it bêste yn alles.
He just now.	Hy die no net.
I think about it a lot.	Ik tink dêr in protte oer.
Little by little.	Bytsje by bytsje.
People who love them, really, really love them.	Minsken dy't fan har hâlde, echt, echt fan har.
I really, really did.	Ik echt, echt dien.
This is not so.	Dit is net sa.
This is actually the best year ever for me.	Dit is eins it bêste jier ea foar my.
It's early in the year.	It is betiid yn it jier.
You have to be afraid of them.	Jo moatte har bang wêze.
And without money.	En sûnder jild.
You can never tell what will happen.	Jo kinne noait fertelle wat der barre sil.
He is still.	Hy is noch altyd.
Sure, he thought, she had to.	Wis, tocht er, se moast.
Things will work out.	Dingen sille wurkje.
You have become beautiful.	Do bist moai wurden.
I tried to talk about it.	Ik besocht der oer te praten.
With this.	Mei dizze.
It was just.	It wie gewoan.
I knew exactly what was going to happen.	Ik wist krekt wat der barre soe.
That will help things.	Dat sil dingen helpe.
We got the money.	Wy krigen it jild.
I think she's here.	Ik tink dat se hjir is.
No woman.	Gjin frou.
As a child.	As bern.
It did not look like where she was looking.	It like der net út wêr't se seach.
It was this way.	It wie dizze manier.
It was just in time.	It wie krekt op tiid.
We want to ask him but we can not.	Wy wolle him freegje mar wy kinne net.
That was right.	Dat wie krekt.
It really made me feel.	It fielde my echt.
I talk to him a lot.	Ik praat in protte mei him.
She was gone.	Se wie fuort.
Just keep it there.	Hâld it dêr mar.
This is the place to be, the place to see.	Dit is it plak om te wêzen, it plak om te sjen.
I do not know exactly anymore.	Ik wit it net mear krekt.
The man was something else.	De man wie wat oars.
He knew where this man lived.	Hy wist wêr't dizze man wenne.
I was more than a little surprised.	Ik wie mear as in bytsje ferrast.
I had a meeting to come.	Ik hie in gearkomste om te kommen.
He said he had good reason to do so.	Hy sei dat er goede reden hie om it te dwaan.
Are you writing a letter?	Meitsje jo in brief?
I'll come back to that.	Ik kom dêr op werom.
She must have been really angry.	Se moat echt lilk west hawwe.
He can tell you.	Hy kin dy fertelle.
Let me please be with you.	Lit my asjebleaft by dy wêze.
For many people, it's both.	Foar in protte minsken is it beide.
Make it work if you can.	Meitsje it wurk as jo kinne.
They love their children very much.	Se hâlde tige fan har bern.
That's what I'm trying to do.	Dat is wat ik besykje te dwaan.
She did not know which and she did not know why.	Se wist net hokker en se wist net wêrom.
They like to eat there.	Se ite dêr graach.
It was all she needed.	It wie alles wat se nedich hie.
I would love him.	Ik soe him hâlde.
He was our father.	Hy wie ús heit.
That I had expected.	Dat hie ik ferwachte.
I want that for me.	Ik wol dat foar my.
I never knew who it was.	Ik wist noait wa't it wie.
Can no longer.	Kin net mear.
I know maybe something that can help you.	Ik wit miskien wat dat jo kin helpe.
He was pretty good at it.	Hy wie der aardich goed yn.
That is much better.	Dat is folle better.
You can not ask one person not to tell another.	Jo kinne net ien persoan freegje om in oare net te fertellen.
He is like family.	Hy is as famylje.
I might have been there with him.	Ik hie der miskien by him west.
We do not say that.	Dat sizze wy net.
Nobody knows how to do that.	Nimmen wit hoe't dat moat.
A beautiful thing.	In moai ding.
This time it remained days.	Dizze kear bleau it dagen.
please.	asjebleaft.
I'm so angry now.	Ik bin no sa lilk.
They go for it.	Se geane derop.
These are not his questions.	It binne net syn fragen.
See this issue.	Sjoch dit probleem.
I will not believe that.	Dat sil ik net leauwe.
It looked like nothing they had seen before.	It like neat dat se earder sjoen hiene.
It's neither good nor bad.	It is net goed noch min.
I know it has for me.	Ik wit dat it foar my hat.
That can not be said here.	Dat kin hjir net sein wurde.
How beautiful!	Wat moai!
he will say.	hy sil sizze.
To find out more.	Om mear te finen.
Let's take the kids.	Litte wy de bern nimme.
Believe me, it will not work.	Leau my, it sil net wurkje.
I was too late, he said.	Ik wie te let, sei er.
He did it alone.	Hy die it allinnich.
And here we are again.	En hjir binne wy ​​wer.
Good and good.	Goed en goed.
Can not either.	Kin ek net.
I walked through the city.	Ik rûn troch de stêd.
She wished she had not come.	Se woe dat se net kommen wie.
I wanted to make time.	Ik woe tiid meitsje.
Everyone looks up.	Elkenien sjocht op.
I feel them.	Ik fiel se.
He was without help or hope.	Hy wie sûnder help of hope.
Real food, whole food, nice food.	Echt iten, hiele iten, aardich iten.
I looked across the room.	Ik seach oer de keamer.
This is very easy to do.	Dit is hiel maklik te dwaan.
This is a really nice place.	Dit is in echt moai plak.
Where is that? 	Wêr is dat?
This is not 'free reading'.	Dit is gjin 'frij lêzen'.
I have no problems with this.	Ik haw gjin problemen mei dizze.
You're wrong.	Do bist ferkeard.
You need to know this.	Jo moatte dit witte.
We'll talk to her.	Wy sille mei har prate.
Not that she did much of either.	Net dat se in protte fan beide die.
You're going home.	Jo geane nei hûs.
We want to get out of here.	Wy wolle hjir wei.
What he likes.	Wat hy liket.
He could work with that.	Dêr koe er mei wurkje.
But you know, people always say you look like one.	Mar jo witte, minsken sizze altyd dat jo op ien lykje.
That hurt me a little bit.	Dat makke my in bytsje sear.
Things will be difficult, but you will get through it.	Dingen sille dreech wêze, mar jo sille der troch komme.
Everything they need, they will have.	Alles wat se nedich binne, sille se hawwe.
But it's not true.	Mar it is net wier.
See what you did last time.	Sjoch wat jo de lêste kear dien hawwe.
One of the two for sure.	Ien fan de twa foar wis.
He should be ready soon.	Hy moat gau klear wêze.
Maybe it can.	Miskien kin it.
I'm ready to go now.	Ik bin no klear om te gean.
But not everyone is happy.	Mar net elkenien wurdt bliid.
The police did not come at all.	De plysje kaam hielendal net.
I just wanted to know if people say that or not.	Ik woe gewoan witte oft minsken dat sizze of net.
We like it here.	Wy fine it hjir goed.
No one would ever do that.	Nimmen soe dat ea meitsje.
With my family.	Mei myn famylje.
We just love to eat !.	Wy gewoan graach ite!.
All right, he said.	Goed, sei er.
No one has ever visited him.	Nimmen hat him ea besocht.
It was just him.	It wie allinnich hy.
Everything went well.	Alles is goed gien.
We do not know.	Wy witte it net.
You do not need it.	Jo hawwe it net nedich.
I would not be here otherwise.	Ik soe hjir oars net wêze.
I'm there now.	Ik bin der no.
But come on.	Mar kom op.
He wants them back.	Hy wol se werom.
But three times.	Mar trije kear.
I hope you like it.	Ik hoopje dat jo it leuk fine.
And then again nothing.	En dan noch ien kear neat.
Probably it was a bit of both.	Wierskynlik wie it in bytsje fan beide.
She had made it.	Se hie it makke.
That will tell you.	Dat sil dy fertelle.
I can not find it either.	Ik kin it ek net fine.
And so is life.	En dat is it libben ek.
But it was just that.	Mar it wie krekt dat.
We have one meeting a month.	Wy hawwe ien gearkomste yn 'e moanne.
Hold your hand.	Hâld dyn hân.
I read it and it did things with me.	Ik haw it lêzen en it die dingen mei my.
Nothing will happen if people do nothing.	Der sil neat barre as minsken neat dogge.
I know nothing else.	Ik wit neat oars.
But that's not what happened.	Mar dat is net wat der bard is.
I said nothing to anyone else.	Ik sei neat tsjin immen oars.
Otherwise she had nothing to do.	Oars hie se neat oan.
Better buy two.	Better twa keapje.
Or they do not, and are not.	Of se dogge net, en binne net.
I want you with me.	Ik wol dy by my.
Not much chance for him to go.	Net in protte kâns foar him om te gean.
Everyone knows what to do.	Elkenien wit wat te dwaan.
Have a nice weekend.	Hawwe in leuk wykein.
Now he can do little else but look after her.	No kin er net folle oars dwaan as nei har sjen.
But let's make it busy.	Mar litte wy it drok meitsje.
Now was not the time for many words.	No wie net de tiid foar in protte wurden.
More so now after seeing that photo.	Mear sa no nei it sjen fan dy foto.
She would not do that.	Dat soe se net dwaan.
But he's in trouble.	Mar hy sit yn de problemen.
He just wanted to get back to work.	Hy woe gewoan wer oan it wurk.
Things were not easy yet.	Dingen wiene noch net maklik.
I just can not.	Ik kin gewoan net.
And he came back soon.	En hy kaam gau werom.
It will be tired, he thought to himself.	It sil wurch wêze, tocht er by himsels.
He just came back.	Hy kaam net werom.
They come at once.	Se komme yn ien kear.
But somehow it does not matter.	Mar op ien of oare manier makket it neat út.
A few things.	In pear dingen.
That was the only thing they could do.	Dat wie it iennichste wat se dwaan koene.
This probably has some truth to it.	Dit hat wierskynlik wat wierheid oan it.
It is true or not.	It is wier of net.
They had just bought a new dog.	Se hiene krekt in nije hûn kocht.
I wanted to know what it was for.	Ik woe witte wêr't it foar wie.
But she was wrong.	Mar se wie ferkeard.
So sorry.	It spyt my sa.
He came here yesterday	Hy kaam hjir juster
That day may come.	Dy dei kin komme.
If you find them.	As jo ​​fine har.
It's also hard to make one.	It is ek dreech om ien te meitsjen.
It's not for us.	It is net foar ús.
What could have happened at all.	Wat koe hielendal barre.
We need to get them all here.	Wy moatte se hjir allegear krije.
Join us today !.	Doch mei ús hjoed!.
I did not even know it.	Ik wist it sels net.
Those are his children.	Dat binne syn bern.
Let's just go to dinner.	Lit ús mar nei it iten gean.
There are only two people.	Der binne mar twa minsken.
I'll be in the office if you need me.	Ik sil op it kantoar wêze as jo my nedich hawwe.
I have no chance.	Ik haw gjin kâns.
And as he walked, he made a plan.	En doe't er rûn, makke er in plan.
It's time to go.	It is tiid om te gean.
You're an animal.	Do bist in bist.
Nobody talks to each other.	Nimmen prate mei elkoar.
He did not think that would be a problem.	Hy tocht net dat dat in probleem wurde soe.
I knew him a little.	Ik koe him in bytsje.
Just like you think you are.	Krekt as jo tinke dat jo binne.
I do not want him to see me that way.	Ik wol net dat er my sa sjocht.
No one was ever sure.	Nimmen wie oait wis.
Things are sort of.	Dingen binne soarte fan.
It does not have to be difficult.	It hoecht net dreech te wêzen.
She would know it soon enough.	Se soe it gau genôch witte.
But we can not let them.	Mar wy kinne har net litte.
The boy lived all alone.	De jonge wenne hielendal allinnich.
They are probably not back yet.	Se binne wierskynlik noch net werom.
I work with you.	Ik wurkje mei dy.
I surprise her with a new one.	Ik ferrast har mei in nije.
I do not want you here.	Ik wol dy hjir net.
Or maybe with.	Of miskien mei.
You think if anyone knows it, it must be him.	Jo tinke as immen it wit, it moat him wêze.
I think it is.	Ik tink dat it it is.
I may be the last.	Ik kin de lêste wêze.
We talk and talk.	Wy prate en prate.
Just started.	Krekt begûn.
It's up to my dog.	It is oan myn hûn.
She was exactly where she belonged.	Se wie krekt wêr't se hearde.
But her work was very good.	Mar har wurk wie tige goed.
She had no friends.	Se hie gjin freonen.
It could be anyone.	It koe elkenien wêze.
It's coming a long way.	It komt lang oan.
Dad got it for me.	Heit krige it foar my.
But there was.	Mar der wie.
They could not stay here long.	Se koene hjir net lang bliuwe.
That would be better.	Dat soe better wêze.
This is more of an issue for me.	Dit is mear in probleem foar my.
I always am.	Ik bin altyd.
But no one really knows.	Mar nimmen wit it echt.
No one was happy with this.	Nimmen wie hjir bliid mei.
She could handle it.	Se koe it oan.
I remember more that no one else could.	Ik tink der mear oan dat nimmen oars koe.
How said that is.	Hoe sein is dat.
It will still take time.	It sil noch tiid nedich wêze.
Never, never, never.	Nea, nea, nea.
Together we can do it !.	Tegearre kinne wy ​​it dwaan!.
We'll leave it there for now.	Wy litte it der foar no.
She would go home, she had said.	Se soe nei hûs ta, hie se sein.
I'm coming right away.	Dy kom ik fuort fuort.
Even we do not know for sure.	Sels wy witte it net wis.
I'm actually a man.	Ik bin eins in man.
Just not in words.	Krekt net yn wurden.
I hope that is true.	Ik hoopje dat dat wier is.
Do not tell anyone.	Fertel it net oan ien.
Look at us now.	Sjoch no nei ús.
She does not know who she is.	Se wit net wa't se is.
The first time for my kids and me.	De earste kear foar myn bern en my.
But he was clear.	Mar hy wie dúdlik.
For the first time, the man looked old to him.	Foar it earst like de man him âld.
Neither does life.	It libben ek net.
They were done.	Se wiene dien.
It has always worked.	It hat altyd wurke.
You will make a lot of friends here.	Jo sille meitsje in protte freonen hjir.
So we can not stop either.	Sa kinne wy ​​ek net ophâlde.
I will not stay long.	Ik sil net lang bliuwe.
They have to ask for everything.	Se moatte alles freegje.
She knew it and she knew he knew it.	Se wist it en se wist dat hy it wist.
No one could see me there.	Nimmen koe my dêr sjen.
Is he with friends?	Is hy mei freonen?
I will stay here.	Ik sil hjir bliuwe.
There was a lot of trying to find it.	Der waard in protte besocht om it te finen.
This is my job.	Dit is myn wurk.
She has not eaten all day.	Se hat de hiele dei net iten.
Now to my question.	No nei myn fraach.
Just like we did.	Krekt as wy diene.
He always walked to school.	Hy rûn altyd nei skoalle.
I love you a lot.	Ik hâld in protte fan dy.
She said she was tired.	Se sei dat se wurch wie.
They were his friends.	Se wiene syn freonen.
I think she did the right thing.	Ik tink dat se it goede ding dien hat.
He had gotten where he had come from here.	Hy hie krigen wêr't er hjir kommen wie.
I'm tired.	Ik bin wol wurch.
She was not sure how it worked.	Se wie net wis hoe't it wurke.
I found this here.	Ik fûn dizze hjir.
A lot here.	In protte hier.
In fact, they did not.	Eins diene se net.
I'm just happy to be here.	Ik bin gewoan bliid hjir te wêzen.
They just want more and can not do without it.	Se wolle allinnich mar mear en kinne der net sûnder.
Many children still have to go to school.	In protte bern moatte noch nei skoalle.
And then we'll talk about it again next week.	En dan prate wy der nije wike wer oer.
You never know you will get it again and again and again.	Jo witte noait dat jo wer en wer en wer krije sille.
It was my first time away from home.	It wie myn earste kear fuort fan hûs.
The old man was not in it.	De âld man wie der net yn.
It may still work.	It kin noch wurkje.
I knew this place well.	Ik koe dit plak goed.
One word is hard to come by.	Ien wurd is dreech om te kommen mei.
But we.	Mar wy .
This is my place, more and more.	Dit is myn plak, mear en mear.
She works hard.	Se wurket hurd.
I was so busy.	Ik wie sa drok.
And if something can happen, that's fine.	En as der wat barre kin, is dat goed.
It was not the best, but it worked.	It wie net de bêste, mar it wurke.
He only knew he did not want to be alone.	Hy wist allinnich dat er net allinnich wêze woe.
That's a problem, but good.	Dat is in probleem, mar goed.
In fact, she had been.	Eins hie se west.
This book is about how to get there.	Dit boek giet oer hoe't jo dêr komme kinne.
He said he would come there to help me.	Hy sei dat er dêr komme soe om my te helpen.
I could not pay her.	Ik koe har net betelje.
But we are out of time.	Mar wy binne út 'e tiid.
By the lake.	By de mar.
He needed him in me.	Hy hie him yn my nedich.
He was the best dog ever.	Hy wie de bêste hûn ea.
It's just the truth.	It is gewoan de wierheid.
And that's what makes you very angry.	En dat is wat jo tige lilk makket.
She felt the whole time he was looking at her.	Se fielde de hiele tiid dat er nei har seach.
They are still at work.	Se binne noch oan it wurk.
I do not know how I can do it, can you help.	Ik wit net hoe't ik it dwaan kin, kinne jo helpe.
I felt the same.	Ik fielde itselde.
No yesterday.	Nei juster.
He would visit the prison again.	Hy soe de finzenis wer besykje.
No one will take it.	Nimmen sil it nimme.
This is what will happen.	Dit is wat der barre sil.
People are still talking about food.	Minsken prate noch oer it iten.
Or tried to be.	Of besocht te wêzen.
It's in your mind.	It is yn jo gedachten.
Otherwise he is fine.	Oars giet it goed mei him.
But of course.	Mar fansels.
I'm sure this time.	Ik bin wis dizze kear.
Let's go Let's go.	Litte wy gean litte wy gean.
It is so now.	It is no sa.
I do not want to go back on that.	Dêr wol ik net op werom.
We could talk about that.	Dêr koene wy ​​oer prate.
But that could not.	Mar dat koe net.
He had not even seen him before.	Hy seach him net iens earder.
Of course we have some work to do.	Fansels hawwe wy wat wurk te dwaan.
She really did not want to go there.	Dêr woe se eins net hinne.
Look at those two.	Sjoch nei dy twa.
I knew away.	Ik wist fuort.
No one is coming.	Gjinien komt.
People come in and out all day.	Minsken komme de hiele dei yn en út.
They do not come here to do that.	Se komme hjir net om dat te dwaan.
We don't talk anymore.	Wy prate net mear.
He will tell a little about it in a song.	Hy sil der in bytsje oer fertelle yn in liet.
But it's still there.	Mar it is der noch.
They are off.	Se binne ôf.
I really did not know what to say to him.	Ik wist eins net wat ik tsjin him sizze moast.
I love being here.	Ik hâld fan hjir te wêzen.
I think he's talking to everyone.	Ik tink dat hy mei elkenien praat.
But you do not have to be.	Mar jo moatte net wêze.
Well, let them go.	No, lit se gean.
That will never happen.	Dat sil nea barre.
Now was that day.	No wie dy dei.
The alarm clock woke me up.	De wekker makke my wekker.
This time he felt something give.	Dizze kear fielde er wat jaan.
There was just no way.	Der wie gewoan gjin manier.
Well, let me ask you this.	No, lit my dy dit freegje.
I would say this.	Ik soe sizze dit.
You have to see him with his kids.	Jo moatte him sjen mei syn bern.
Anyway, that's it for me.	Hoe dan ek, dat is it foar my.
It did, what.	It die, wat.
I'm sure they are.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se binne.
This would have been the great room.	Dit soe de grutte keamer west hawwe.
Here you can see for yourself.	Hjir kinne jo sels sjen.
The morning came and they had not found her.	De moarn kaam en se hiene har net fûn.
Win.	Winne.
Go back to life.	Gean werom nei it libben.
But he did not give in.	Mar hy joech net yn.
Something had gone wrong.	Der wie wat ferkeard gien.
You're doing pretty well with it.	Jo dogge it der aardich goed mei.
She probably never gets over it.	Se komt der wierskynlik noait oer.
Do not talk to her.	Gean net mei har prate.
He walked away.	Hy gie fuort.
We know that too.	Dat witte wy ek.
I think the people are ready for it.	Ik tink dat de minsken der klear foar binne.
Otherwise, the place looked much the same.	Oars like it plak in protte itselde.
Of everything in my life that you no longer have.	Fan alles yn myn libben dat jo net mear hawwe.
But we do not have to deal with that.	Mar dêr hoege wy ús net mei te dwaan.
Everyone wants it.	Elkenien wol it.
You need it, they have it.	Jo hawwe it nedich, se hawwe it.
No way back.	Gjin wei werom.
I thought we would be together forever.	Ik tocht dat wy foar altyd tegearre wêze soene.
After three years there, she returned home.	Nei trije jier dêr kaam se wer thús.
Very easy to make.	Hiel maklik te meitsjen.
Probably better in bed too.	Wierskynlik ek better op bêd.
It would do.	It soe dwaan.
It seems good to me.	It liket my goed.
All of that will leave you exactly where you were.	Dat alles sil jo krekt litte wêr't jo wiene.
I convinced him.	Ik oertsjûge him.
Maybe she just hadn’t hit it off.	Miskien hie se net allinnich it net rekke.
I worked for him for two years.	Ik wurke al twa jier foar him.
I did not see you there.	Ik seach dy dêr net.
And a friend to everyone.	En in freon foar elkenien.
We are not surprised.	Wy binne net ferrast.
Someone is sick.	Immen is siik.
Maybe she would do that.	Miskien soe se dat dwaan.
I do not need this.	Ik haw dit net nedich.
Quite a few times actually.	In hiel pear kear eins.
I can tell you that now.	Dat kin ik jo no sizze.
I could do nothing about it forever.	Ik koe der foar altyd neat dwaan.
He's right there.	Hy is der krekt.
She had it.	Se hie it.
But there was this new house that only looked old.	Mar d'r wie dit nije hûs dat allinnich âld like.
But it was not the same.	Mar it wie net itselde.
These first two things were true.	Dizze earste twa dingen wiene wier.
It's a difficult place.	It is in dreech plak.
I had never thought of that.	Ik hie der noait oan tocht.
I convinced her to give him a chance.	Ik haw har oertsjûge om him in kâns te jaan.
Be open to anything and everything.	Wês iepen foar alles en alles.
I can not with her.	Ik kin net mei har.
which one.	hokker.
I can not even be a friend.	Ik kin net iens in freon wêze.
That was not good enough.	Dat wie net goed genôch.
Has anyone happened.	Hat elkenien bard.
If you want to go, let's go.	As jo ​​gean wolle, lit ús gean.
No one can get the best out of me, he thought.	Nimmen kin it bêste fan my krije, tocht er.
We know that for sure.	Dat witte wy wis.
They touched him.	Se rekke him oan.
This is a pretty big one.	Dit is in moai grutte ien.
My question is now.	Myn fraach is no.
The more you work, the more money.	Hoe mear jo wurkje, hoe mear jild.
I do not know where it is.	Ik wit net wêr't it is.
No more questions until you're done.	Gjin fragen mear oant jo klear binne.
But it is no more.	Mar it is net mear.
Money was found pretty quickly.	Jild waard frij gau fûn.
And so many things to talk about.	En safolle dingen om oer te praten.
You would see it happen.	Jo soene it barre sjen.
Maybe I read the whole book that day.	Miskien haw ik dy dei it hiele boek lêzen.
Can show you a little, maybe.	Kin dy in bytsje sjen litte, miskien.
Then we just have to see.	Dan moatte wy mar sjen.
They are around.	Se binne om.
I have tried once.	Ik haw ien kear besocht.
It's a fun thing to have.	It is in leuk ding om te hawwen.
She was still very much alive.	Se wie noch tige yn libben.
Eating together.	Iten tegearre.
I hope you know that.	Ik hoopje dat jo dat witte.
If so, that's a good idea.	As dat sa is, is it in goed idee.
Nobody knows where you are.	Nimmen wit wêr't jo binne.
I do not know why, but he is.	Ik wit net wêrom, mar hy is.
That it has none.	Dat it gjinien hat.
His mother had been in his room.	Syn mem hie yn syn keamer west.
He would say what he felt was true.	Hy soe sizze wat hy fielde wier wie.
Maybe they would like it.	Miskien soene se dêr goed mei fine.
I do not think she was wrong to do so.	Ik tink net dat se ferkeard wie om it te dwaan.
We would have bought them all too.	Wy soene se ek allegear kocht ha.
No one had ever said he looked like his father.	Nimmen hie ea sein dat er op syn heit like.
And now it may be too late.	En no kin it te let wêze.
I gave him the money.	Ik joech him it jild.
She gave me her name.	Se joech my har namme.
It happens, it is.	It bart, it is.
The dog did the same.	De hûn die itselde.
You have to stay away from him.	Jo moatte fan him ôf bliuwe.
It could work though.	It koe wol wurkje.
We tried everything we could think of.	Wy hawwe alles besocht wat wy tinke kinne.
It never gets really easy.	It wurdt noait echt maklik.
A little too hard.	In bytsje te hurd.
The problem is, you do not.	It probleem is, jo dogge it net.
I just can not wait.	Ik kin gewoan net wachtsje.
But true, it can be anything.	Mar wier, it kin alles wêze.
Both are gone.	Beide binne fuort.
He never does it.	Hy docht it noait.
That's not much.	Dat is net folle.
They become friends for life.	Se wurde freonen foar it libben.
It's just fine.	It is gewoan goed.
We want to be ourselves.	Wy wolle ús wêze.
This did not go well either.	Dit gie ek net goed.
If you want one, buy it yourself.	As jo ​​ien wolle, keapje it sels.
This is not a good job.	Dit is gjin goed wurk.
That our family is sick.	Dat ús famylje siik is.
I would not take it.	Ik soe it net nimme.
This time it's by one man.	Dizze kear is it troch ien man.
Before she started work, she made up the room.	Foardat se oan it wurk begûn, makke se de keamer op.
No one knows why or how.	Nimmen wit wêrom of hoe.
Now that would have been nice.	No wie dat wol aardich.
You want something from me.	Jo wolle wat fan my.
But we never talked about food.	Mar wy hawwe it noait oer iten hân.
We have to play nice.	Wy moatte moai spylje.
I had to find a new job.	Ik moast in nije baan fine.
But nothing worked.	Mar neat wurke.
Let's talk, let's happen.	Lit ús prate, litte wy it barre.
I really do.	Ik echt dwaan.
Look forward to the next book.	Sjoch út nei it folgjende boek.
Could not see it.	Koe it net sjen.
I have a chance to buy it.	Ik haw in kâns om te keapjen it.
I looked at the door.	Ik seach nei de doar.
I have them all over the house.	Ik haw se oer it hûs.
She had never done that before.	Dat hie se noch nea dien.
She can not go back now.	Se kin no net mear werom.
People are still talking about that now.	Dêr prate minsken no noch oer.
The man went to bed.	De man gie op bêd.
You will know the way.	Jo sille de wei witte.
He liked them too.	Hy mocht se ek graach.
We had that idea.	Dat idee hiene wy.
You know, just in case you like it.	Jo witte, krekt as jo it leuk fine.
I'm so happy.	Ik bin sa bliid.
At my home.	By my thús.
They work for him and talk to him.	Se wurkje foar him en prate mei him.
But it's hard, very hard.	Mar it is dreech, hiel dreech.
Not sure if it works.	Net wis oft it wurket.
All of this has made you who you are today.	Dit alles hat jo makke wa't jo hjoed binne.
That's enough.	Dat is genôch.
But today we will do just that.	Mar hjoed sille wy dat krekt dwaan.
I ask her if she looked like my husband.	Ik freegje har oft se like my man.
I had never heard a woman talk in this way.	Ik hie noch noait in frou op dizze manier praten heard.
He would do anything.	Hy soe alles dwaan.
We are not even interested in it, but we need money.	Wy binne der sels net yn ynteressearre, mar wy hawwe jild nedich.
But not many would stick with it.	Mar net folle soene der by hâlde.
But she was still beautiful.	Mar se wie noch moai.
This is not going away.	Dit giet net fuort.
It really is something.	It is echt wat.
You are not my child.	Do bist myn bern net.
Maybe more than a year.	Miskien mear as in jier.
, they agree.	, ha se der mei iens.
She had just met him.	Se hie him krekt moete.
Who is the new one.	Wa is de nije.
See it and think.	Sjoch it en tink.
I've been good with him.	Ik haw goed mei him west.
My mother and my father.	Myn mem en myn heit.
Never did it again, never intended to do it again.	Nea die it wer, wie net fan plan om it oait wer te dwaan.
We can not stay here.	Wy kinne hjir net bliuwe.
I'm fine.	Ik haw goed.
We need to be able to help each other.	Wy moatte elkoar helpe kinne.
Or there could be none.	Of der koe gjin wêze.
Make it what you want it to be.	Meitsje it wat jo wolle.
Every day after work.	Alle dagen nei it wurk.
He had to be.	Hy moast wêze.
It would be done.	It soe dien wurde.
But we are not ready for that now.	Mar dêr binne wy ​​no net klear foar.
We can think about this in a different way.	Wy kinne hjir op in oare manier oer tinke.
Probably the same as everything else here.	Wierskynlik itselde as al it oare hjir.
You will like them.	Jo sille se leuk fine.
You have to go.	Jo moatte fuort.
She looked a little sick.	Se seach der wat siik út.
But of course we had nothing to do with it.	Mar dêr hiene wy ​​fansels neat mei te krijen.
It may have been at home.	It kin by it hûs west hawwe.
We love you.	Wy hâlde fan dy.
It's a little different.	It is in bytsje oars.
Tell him to stop	Fertel him om op te hâlden
They were almost there.	Se wiene der hast.
Of course he was not sure.	Fansels wie er der net wis fan.
You can also help.	Jo kinne ek helpe.
No one felt good.	Nimmen fielde goed.
Still here we are.	Noch hjir binne wy.
I think that's enough.	Ik tink dat is genôch.
They want to make a movie about their children.	Se wolle in film meitsje oer har bern.
I'll see you in two days.	Ik sjoch dy oer twa dagen.
He and a few of his friends.	Hy en in pear fan syn freonen.
I do not see it happening yet.	Ik sjoch it noch net barre.
It's going fast.	It giet gau.
But then.	Mar dan.
Everyone knows him.	Elkenien ken him.
We have so much time.	Wy hawwe safolle tiid.
People watch.	Minsken sjen.
He will take nothing.	Hy sil neat nimme.
We love each other.	Wy hâlde fan elkoar.
He was my favorite person.	Hy wie myn favorite persoan.
I do not know when.	Ik wit net wannear.
Or so it must be.	Of sa moat it.
She had something.	Se hie wat.
We do not know what will happen.	Wy kinne net witte wat der barre sil.
I could stay there forever.	Ik koe der foar altyd bliuwe.
And that worked.	En dat wurke.
He wanted to know more about her.	Hy woe mear oer har witte.
I thought you knew better than that.	Ik tocht dat jo better wisten as dat.
She was alive, and good enough to talk.	Se wie yn libben, en goed genôch om te praten.
He would never let it go.	Hy soe it noait litte litte.
Today, everyone does that.	Hjoed docht elkenien dat.
He saw her go.	Hy seach har gean.
But of course she liked it.	Mar se mocht it fansels graach.
This is your job.	Dit is dyn wurk.
Be careful with this.	Wês foarsichtich mei dizze.
I took something.	Ik naam wat.
You will not let it go.	Jo sille it net litte.
She was not wrong.	Se wie net ferkeard.
You would never make it.	Jo soene it noait meitsje.
Or what had.	Of wat hie.
You need to talk to them.	Jo moatte mei har prate.
She had to be careful.	Se moast foarsichtich wêze.
She looked at her husband.	Se seach har man oan.
He was determined to get her picture.	Hy wie besletten om har foto te krijen.
And boy is he of me.	En jonge is hy fan my.
One more thing.	Noch ien ding.
Let me just have these few days.	Lit my mar dizze pear dagen hawwe.
Are you okay?' 	Giet it goed mei dy?'
I do the same.	Ik doch itselde ek.
They are all gone!	Se binne allegear fuort!
I would be too.	Ik soe ek wêze.
That they were still a family.	Dat se noch in famylje wiene.
He clearly expected to get his children back.	Hy ferwachte dúdlik syn bern werom te krijen.
It's not one thing.	It is gjin ien ding.
You did nothing.	Jo hawwe neat dien.
As if it is not so difficult.	As is it net sa dreech.
I knew it hurt.	Ik wist dat it sear die.
And if you need a good reason, then this is it.	En as jo in goede reden nedich binne, dan is dit it.
It lets us be.	It lit ús wêze.
I can only do something about it.	Ik kin der mar wat fan dwaan.
I have nothing in my life.	Ik haw neat yn myn libben.
I read it once, a long time ago.	Ik haw it ien kear lêzen, lang lyn.
I had to leave.	Ik moast fuort.
I do not know why, but we did.	Ik wit net wêrom, mar wy diene.
Of course we will tell everyone that you are with me.	Fansels sille wy elkenien fertelle dat jo mei my binne.
That was good too.	Dat wie ek goed.
It was not my dog.	It wie myn hûn net.
And that's what we were for.	En dêr wiene wy ​​der foar.
He saw what it was.	Hy seach wat it wie.
There was no need to be hard.	D'r wie net nedich om hurd te wêzen.
This is your problem.	Dit is dyn probleem.
I love everything about him.	Ik hâld fan alles oer him.
He made me feel good again.	Hy hat my wer fiel makke.
Try to get to bed early tonight.	Besykje fannacht betiid op bêd te gean.
There must be something.	Der moatte wat wêze.
Soon no one could tell her what she did not know.	Al gau koe nimmen har fertelle wat se net wist.
Well, well, well.	No, goed, goed.
We did not do our job.	Wy hawwe ús wurk net dien.
You must stay with us here.	Jo moatte hjir by ús bliuwe.
Or should be.	Of soe wêze moatte.
He stayed on to find out.	Hy bleau by om út te finen.
We will take care of it.	Wy sille der foar soargje.
The kids have nothing, nothing.	De bern hawwe neat, neat.
We can not leave it at that.	Wy kinne it net sa litte.
I will not stop.	Ik sil net ophâlde.
You know this is true.	Jo witte dat dit wier is.
It works pretty well.	It wurket frij goed.
He also had no money.	Hy hie ek gjin jild.
If you want to go, you must go.	As jo ​​gean wolle, moatte jo gean.
And with her as he goes.	En mei har as er giet.
We then have the following.	Wy hawwe dan it folgjende.
I know exactly what came into them.	Ik wit krekt wat yn har kaam.
Give things a try.	Jou dingen in kâns.
I love this room.	Ik hâld fan dizze keamer.
She's coming back.	Se komt werom.
that was the question.	dat wie de fraach.
Let it go as they go.	Lit it gean as se gean.
Leave it for a day.	Lit it foar in dei.
To make it right in some way.	Om it op ien of oare manier goed te meitsjen.
This used to work well.	Dit wurke eartiids goed.
Maybe, he had nothing to worry about.	Miskien, hy hie neat te soargen oer.
Much of what she had said was true.	In protte fan wat se sein hie wie wier.
I'm getting ready.	Ik meitsje my klear.
We do not have to get into that.	Dêr hoege wy net yn te kommen.
We do not know who they are.	Wy witte net wa't se binne.
I do not know which.	Ik wit net hokker.
This woman did not need him.	Dizze frou hie him net nedich.
We do not think so.	Dat tinke wy net.
He did not see the things he wanted to see.	Hy seach net de dingen dy't er sjen woe.
Well, maybe one.	No, miskien ien.
She shows us to our room.	Se lit ús nei ús keamer sjen.
It has its place.	It hat syn plak.
I never think of him.	Ik tink noait oan him.
You want to keep it all in house.	Jo wolle it allegear yn hûs hâlde.
Easy to make.	Maklik te meitsjen.
He would never do that.	Hy soe dat noait dwaan.
He knew that was not good, but he could not help himself.	Hy wist dat dat net goed wie, mar hy koe himsels net helpe.
It's a really bad idea.	It is in echt min idee.
In fact, that was not entirely true.	Eins wie dat net hielendal wier.
True to size.	Wier oan grutte.
But this is really how it happened.	Mar dit is echt hoe't it barde.
I hope I was not.	Ik hope dat ik it net wie.
Also, it's the truth.	Ek is it de wierheid.
He was waiting when they decided to do something.	Hy wachte doe't se besletten wat te dwaan.
A little too late for school, right?	In bytsje te let foar skoalle, net?
Do you know where this was?	Witte jo wêr't dit wie?
Not so today.	Net sa hjoed.
We all have one.	Wy hawwe allegear ien.
She would not let me talk to him.	Se soe my net mei him prate litte.
For me, it was.	Foar my wie it.
One more thing to keep up with.	Noch ien ding om mei te hâlden.
They did it again this year.	Se hawwe it dit jier wer dien.
But that's just fine.	Mar dat die ek net goed.
She did not want to keep him.	Se woe him net hâlde.
Without him, nothing could be done.	Sûnder him koe neat dien wurde.
The idea seemed to come out of nowhere.	It idee like út it neat te kommen.
I want to become something.	Ik wol wat wurde.
It was just.	It wie gewoan.
He did not look at me.	Hy seach net nei my.
None of this was for us.	Gjin fan dit wie foar ús.
This was just too much.	Dit wie gewoan te folle.
Nobody really looks different.	Nimmen sjocht der echt oars út.
I had a hard time with it.	Ik hie it dreech mei.
But there you have it.	Mar dêr hast it.
No one will see.	Nimmen sil sjen.
It was very bad.	It wie tige min.
He needed a life.	Hy hie in libben nedich.
And this is often true.	En dit is faak wier.
We were early.	Wy wiene betiid.
You will not regret it.	Jo sille gjin spyt hawwe.
Kids love eating foods they make.	Bern hâlde fan iten iten dat se meitsje.
There is nothing to do.	Der is neat te dwaan.
He could not find her.	Hy koe har net fine.
That in itself is difficult.	Dat is op himsels dreech.
Just the thing.	Krekt it ding.
He only thought he had.	Hy tocht allinnich dat er hie.
She will be able to help.	Se sil helpe kinne.
Let's see how.	Lit sjen hoe.
Everyone took it for granted and no longer looked at it.	Elkenien naam it foar fansels en seach der net mear nei.
He eats well, but he says bad.	Hy yt goed, mar hy seit min.
But that did not hurt me.	Mar dat die my net sear.
I know people who want that.	Ik ken minsken dy't dat wolle.
The food is very good here.	It iten is hiel goed hjir.
That was my idea.	Dat wie myn idee.
That's just what I said, boy.	Dat sei ik krekt, jonge.
That is as certain as can be certain.	Dat is sa wis as wis kin wêze.
Can anyone help please ???.	Kin immen helpe asjebleaft???.
But it seemed to be true.	Mar it like wier te wêzen.
So far, he's doing really well.	Oant no ta docht er it echt goed.
It will never do.	It sil nea dwaan.
I'm eating it up.	Ik yt it op.
None of these things are true.	Gjin fan dizze dingen is wier.
And we would not want that.	En dat soene wy ​​net wolle.
She did not know if that was still true or not.	Se wist net oft dat noch wier wie of net.
But it's not good.	Mar it is net goed.
Not exactly now.	No krekt net.
I believe nothing of it.	Ik leau der neat fan.
Tell your friends.	Fertel dyn freonen.
You have been.	Do hast west.
Come on.	Kom op.
I've been at work all morning.	Ik haw de hiele moarn oan it wurk west.
He could not leave twice.	Hy koe net twa kear fuort.
I need to know.	Ik moat it witte.
Finding a job was not easy.	It finen fan in baan wie net maklik.
Not just who does what but when and how often.	Net allinnich wa docht wat mar wannear en hoe faak.
I know life is so hard for you.	Ik wit, it libben is sa dreech foar dy.
There was nothing else to do.	Der wie neat oars te dwaan.
I'm going there to see her.	Ik gean der hinne om har te sjen.
This place is home.	Dit plak is thús.
I do nothing and neither do I.	Ik doch neat en do ek net.
You need this.	Jo moatte dit.
And it does not seem.	En it liket net.
She saw things that were not there.	Se seach dingen dy't der net wiene.
He visited the city often.	Hy besocht de stêd faak.
He never even asked for it.	Hy hat der sels noait om frege.
Now back.	No werom.
It did not die.	It stoar net.
Maybe a long time ago.	Miskien lang lyn.
This is even true if you need to know better.	Dit is sels wier as jo better witte moatte.
Much more.	Folle mear.
To me, she was beautiful.	Foar my wie se moai.
The man had done it with a reason.	De man hie it mei in reden dien.
I got my family to eat.	Ik krige myn famylje om te iten.
It goes with everything.	It giet mei alles.
I've never been there before.	Ik bin der noch noait rûn.
And maybe it was for you.	En miskien wie it foar jo.
It seems easy enough.	It liket maklik genôch.
He had no money with him.	Hy hie gjin jild by him.
I look back on that a lot.	Dêr sjoch ik in protte op werom.
Well, that did not tell her anything.	No, dat hat har neat sein.
I no longer love him.	Ik hâld net mear fan him.
I should not be too busy there.	Ik soe my dêr net al te drok meitsje moatte.
I had a girl to help.	Ik hie in famke om te helpen.
It was made.	It waard makke.
They talk long.	Se prate lang.
That's what we want them to do.	Dat wolle wy dat se dogge.
He would not be the last.	Hy soe net de lêste wêze.
I it just seems too bad.	Ek dit liket net al te min.
She had a life.	Se hie in libben.
Believe me, friends, we do not have to wait long now.	Leau my, freonen, wy moatte no net lang wachtsje.
Maybe his wife has the same problems.	Miskien hat syn frou deselde problemen.
They talk about truth.	Se prate oer wierheid.
But he was too good for her.	Mar hy wie har te goed.
We come to town often enough.	Wy komme faak genôch yn 'e stêd.
It's actually not clear.	It is eins net dúdlik.
I still do a little to this day.	Ik doch noch in bytsje oant hjoed de dei.
I knew that would never be enough.	Ik wist dat dat nea genôch wêze soe.
I knew what it would be like.	Ik wist wat it wêze soe.
Know for sure in an hour.	Witte foar wis oer in oere.
I just need to get better.	Ik moat gewoan better wurde.
I was not there.	Ik wie der net.
I knew it in my whole being.	Ik wist it yn myn hiele wêzen.
We have not seen him since.	Wy hawwe him sûnt net sjoen.
I want you to do it.	Ik wol dat jo it dogge.
I let it do that.	Ik liet it dwaan.
Not just the kids.	Net allinnich de bern.
I had never seen her like this before.	Ik hie noch noait sa'n se sjoen.
I'm not sure how to get it though.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe te krijen it al.
He did not know him.	Hy koe him net.
I know he was.	Ik wit dat hy wie.
That was what we were ready to do.	Dat wiene wy ​​ree om te dwaan.
Which they probably did.	Wat se wierskynlik diene.
We will do our best to hold out until tomorrow.	Wy sille der alles oan dwaan om oant moarn út te hâlden.
He would keep it that way.	Hy soe it sa hâlde.
He did not think he was running.	Hy tocht net, hy rûn.
No truth seems true.	Gjin wierheid liket wier.
It will not be nice.	It sil net moai wêze.
But this actually looks good.	Mar dit sjocht der eins goed út.
Nobody tried.	Nimmen besocht.
You do not, you do not have time.	Jo net, jo hawwe gjin tiid.
I looked back.	Ik seach werom.
It was not the time to find out.	It wie net de tiid om út te finen.
No one here has ever seen a car.	Nimmen hjir hat ea in auto sjoen.
I told him to come over.	Ik fertelde him om oer te kommen.
And she knew that.	En dat wist se wol.
It was up to her now.	It wie no oan har.
See how much you can think of.	Sjoch hoefolle jo kinne tinke oan.
Get out of here, he says.	Gean hjir wei, seit er.
That's too bad.	Dat is te min.
Let's get it right, let's do it right.	Litte wy it goed krije, litte wy it goed dwaan.
It seemed like it was enough to just be there.	It like dat it genôch wie om der gewoan te wêzen.
She will come here.	Se sil hjir komme.
Maybe it's just as good.	Miskien is it like goed.
Not enough.	Net genôch.
I hope to see you soon, he said.	Ik hoopje dy gau te sjen, sei er.
Mar.	Mar.
The work is going well.	It wurk giet goed.
Come if you can.	Kom as jo kinne.
So far, everything works.	Oant no ta wurket alles.
I feel too good.	Ik fiel my te goed.
He could not see them.	Hy koe se net sjen.
Not even for himself.	Net iens foar himsels.
There I see the whole bed.	Dêr sjoch ik it hiele bêd ôf.
He can not see me.	Hy kin my net sjen.
They need us now.	Se hawwe ús no nedich.
And his life.	En syn libben.
One among many.	Ien ûnder in protte.
I would not.	Ik soe net.
What is that about ?.	Wêr giet dat oer?.
I'm a different class than him.	Ik bin in oare klasse as hy.
Just like you are.	Krekt as do bist.
She will take care of that.	Dêr sil se wol foar soargje.
And now they are found.	En no binne se fûn.
This time he had to do it better.	Dizze kear moast er it better goed dwaan.
Who is this person?	Wa is dizze persoan?
That's exactly what he said.	Dat sei er krekt.
She will never.	Se sil nea.
It's so easy now.	It is no sa maklik.
I needed the other.	Ik hie de oare nedich.
I would never have.	Ik soe nea hawwe.
I thought you liked me.	Ik tocht dat jo fan my hâlde.
Or it could be.	Of it kin wêze.
But it's not just people.	Mar it binne net allinnich minsken.
We do not really know why she is going.	Wy witte net echt wêrom't se giet.
I thought of the house.	Ik tocht oan it hûs.
Without ever telling him.	Sûnder it him oait sein te hawwen.
Did you know that there are.	Wisten jo dat der binne.
Let it free you.	Lit it dy frij.
He would have loved to have been here today.	Hy hie hjir hjoed graach west.
And how he knew it.	En hoe't er it wist.
Everything is gone.	Alles is fuort.
What happened to you was true.	Wat mei dy bard wie wier.
She had asked if he wanted to go with her.	Se hie frege oft er wol mei har.
But it never came up.	Mar it kaam noait op.
He is a boy who loves this city.	Hy is in jonge dy't fan dizze stêd hâldt.
Now it's up to you.	No is it oan dy.
And he knows everything.	En hy wit alles.
I can really see your father in you.	Ik kin dyn heit echt yn dy sjen.
She had her good days.	Se hie har goede dagen.
This may not happen again, everyone says.	Dit mei net wer, seit elkenien.
Well, not exactly true.	No, net krekt wier.
From home.	Fan hûs út.
I would love to try.	Ik soe graach besykje.
He was always trying to buy something.	Hy besocht altyd wat te keapjen.
He wanted her.	Hy woe har.
Back to me.	Werom nei my.
I do not feel good about saying these kinds of things.	Ik fiel my net goed om dit soarte dingen te sizzen.
We need to find them.	Wy moatte har fine.
But we find it so.	Mar wy fine it sa.
Rounded out the room.	Rûn de keamer út.
Could not find that.	Koe dat net fine.
I had to get used to it very quickly.	Ik moast der hiel gau oan wenne.
He thought just like us.	Hy tocht krekt as wy.
It has been a round and round problem.	It hat in rûn en rûn probleem west.
But the truth is something else.	Mar de wierheid is wat oars.
Let people just stop reading.	Lit minsken gewoan ophâlde mei it lêzen.
I wondered what was going on.	Ik frege my ôf wat der oan de hân wie.
I saw that he liked her.	Ik seach dat er fan har mocht.
But there was no time.	Mar der wie gjin tiid.
They're coming away.	Se komme fuort.
And now enough of that.	En no genôch fan dat.
I'm getting there.	Ik kom dêr.
Not yet, not at all.	Noch net, net hielendal.
Someone had said his name.	Immen hie syn namme sein.
It was not what she liked.	It wie net wat se leuk hie.
I never thought you could do it.	Ik hie noait tocht dat jo it koene.
It will come in handy though.	It sil wol goed komme.
But maybe we can wake them up.	Mar miskien kinne wy ​​se wekker meitsje.
You'll probably never know, but we do.	Jo sille it wierskynlik noait witte, mar wy dogge it.
Maybe it hadn’t quite happened that way.	Miskien wie it net hielendal sa bard.
Let us be clear here.	Lit ús hjir dúdlik wêze.
What was it.	Wat wie it.
And you can see it too.	En jo kinne it ek sjen.
They love food.	Se hâlde har fan iten ôf.
I did not find that so easy.	Dat fûn ik net sa maklik.
I had food and water.	Ik hie iten en wetter.
They were too hard on her.	Se wiene har te dreech.
If so, it was too late.	As dat sa wie, wie it te let.
Maybe not one of these works.	Miskien net ien fan dizze wurk.
As if we did not know what year this is.	As wisten wy net hokker jier dit is.
I did not want to see.	Ik woe net sjen.
A life for a life.	In libben foar in libben.
It will make our life very easy.	It sil ús libben heul maklik meitsje.
I really want to talk to you.	Ik wol echt mei dy prate.
What were you doing wrong.	Wat wiene jo ferkeard.
You never have to do that.	Dat hoege jo noait te dwaan.
He had a word for everyone.	Hy hie in wurd foar elkenien.
Now we are.	No binne wy.
Your name.	Dyn namme.
He had his hand on this and that.	Hy hie syn hân op dit en dat besocht.
He will probably not be long this time either.	Hy sil dizze kear nei alle gedachten ek net lang wêze.
Well, it looks like he did it very well.	No, it liket derop dat er it hiel goed dien hat.
We've never seen him.	Wy hawwe him nea sjoen.
You know what we want.	Jo witte wat wy wolle.
Everyone was talking about him.	Elkenien hie it oer him.
This is going to be so difficult.	Dit sil sa dreech wêze.
That's not quite good enough.	Dat is net hielendal goed genôch.
If it were not for him, she would not make it.	As it net foar him wie, soe se it net meitsje.
You asked me.	Do hiest my frege.
A city that was once home, but was no longer.	In stêd dy't eartiids thús wie, mar net mear wie.
Today was different.	Hjoed wie oars.
This is the last one.	Dit is de lêste.
You really do not know what those questions are.	Jo witte echt net wat dy fragen binne.
Has a few friends.	Hat in pear freonen.
It's this way.	It is dizze manier.
I bought it on the spot.	Ik kocht it op it plak.
But they do it too.	Mar se dogge it ek.
In fact, nothing happened.	Eins is der neat bard.
He could not get enough of it.	Hy koe der net genôch fan krije.
Just something to keep in mind.	Krekt wat om yn gedachten te hâlden.
But it was not one.	Mar it wie net ien.
It was clear he knew him.	It wie dúdlik dat hy him koe.
It had already started as one.	It wie al begûn as ien.
Now away with you.	No fuort mei dy.
My parents had never met anyone who did these other things.	Myn âlden hiene noait ien moete dy't dizze oare dingen die.
But it's very late.	Mar it is hiel let.
We have a seat for you.	Wy hawwe in sit foar dy.
Is everything okay? 	Is alles goed?
he asked.	hy frege.
They know what they are doing.	Se witte wat se dogge.
I've seen them.	Ik haw se sjoen.
Is for work.	Is foar wurk.
He wished it was good.	Hy woe dat it goed wie.
Same with us.	Itselde mei ús.
Nothing happened again.	Der barde wer neat.
Can see him.	Kin him sjen.
Now he's here.	No is er hjir.
It will be so.	It sil sa wêze.
I was too late.	Ik wie te let.
Do not want to talk.	Wol net prate.
Or with you, now.	Of mei dy, no.
Get it now.	Krije jo it no.
We have to do all the work.	Wy moatte al it wurk dwaan.
There was no place to go.	Der wie gjin plak om te gean.
But it will be here soon.	Mar it sil hjir gau wêze.
I had a few left.	Ik hie in pear oer.
Young people need hope.	Jonge minsken hawwe hope nedich.
So he continued to work hard in this way.	Sa bleau er op dizze manier hurd wurkje.
As a father as a child.	As heit as bern.
He would not speak against me.	Hy soe net tsjin my prate.
He looked from across the room	Hy seach fan oer de keamer wei
His parents did too.	Syn âlden diene ek.
It's been fun.	It is leuk west.
But it is there.	Mar it is der.
The best you can do is do what you have done.	It bêste dat jo kinne dwaan is wat jo dien hawwe.
Record one idea.	Nim ien idee op.
And there's a problem.	En der is in probleem.
She did not even want to go in there.	Se woe der net iens yn út.
There could be anything.	Der koe fan alles wêze.
I love talking.	Ik hâld fan praten.
He did not prepare himself.	Hy makke him net klear.
And that time we did not have.	En dy tiid hiene wy ​​net.
You may have problems.	Jo kinne problemen hawwe.
And they will do the same to me.	En se sille my itselde dwaan.
I did not just want my money back.	Ik woe net allinnich myn jild werom.
I feel it.	Ik fiel it.
You're an old man, he said to himself.	Do bist in âld man, sei er tsjin himsels.
That everyone should know now.	Dat soe elkenien no witte moatte.
And another one.	En noch ien.
Take for our home.	Nim foar ús thús.
I had not even told anyone.	Ik hie it net iens oan immen ferteld.
This is not exactly true.	Dit is net krekt wier.
We do things well.	Wy dogge dingen goed.
That person cannot have children.	Dy persoan kin gjin bern krije.
To worry everyone.	Om elkenien soargen te meitsjen.
He would not have been there.	Hy soe der net west hawwe.
That should be done here as well.	Dat moat hjir ek dien wurde.
Never had a family.	Nea hie in famylje.
To this day, they have not.	Oant hjoed de dei hawwe se net.
If all went well.	As alles goed gie.
I want to know one more thing.	Ik wol noch ien ding witte.
The day started off very well	De dei begûn tige
And of course it is for me.	En fansels is it foar my.
She no longer loves me.	Se hâldt net mear fan my.
He was very interested.	Hy wie tige ynteressearre.
Well, he must be.	No, hy moat wêze.
It makes her good at her job, actually.	It makket har goed yn har wurk, eins.
He is holding something in his hand.	Hy hâldt wat yn 'e hân.
They look like nothing.	Se lykje neat.
Maybe that will be enough.	Miskien sil it genôch wêze.
They remain good friends.	Se bliuwe goede freonen.
They were here.	Se wiene hjir.
It's easy to see why this should be so.	It is maklik om te sjen wêrom't dit sa moat.
Why he did not know.	Wêrom wist er net.
What! 	Wat!
He's worried.	Hy hat soargen.
I did not ask him.	Ik haw him net frege.
This man could.	Dizze man koe.
Give it to her.	Jou it har.
She says it went well.	Se seit dat it goed gie.
I'm trying to find a way to go.	Ik besykje in manier te finen om te gean.
But who needs it.	Mar wa hat it nedich.
I've seen it once or twice.	Ik haw it ien of twa kear sjoen.
I did things and did not quit.	Ik die dingen en die net ôf.
She was really a good thing to me.	Se wie echt in goed ding foar my.
Just trying to get out.	Krekt besykje út te kommen.
That never happens.	Dat bart noait.
There was no question about it.	Der wie gjin fraach oer.
Go away, boy.	Gean fuort, jonge.
I'll show her that we know how to eat.	Ik sil har sjen litte dat wy witte hoe't wy ite moatte.
Of course he was wrong.	Fansels hie er it ferkeard.
But everyone could tell what happened.	Mar elkenien koe fertelle wat der barde.
So she goes out.	Sa giet se út.
She has two or three children.	Se hat twa of trije bern.
It worked.	It wurke.
A boy or a girl?	In jonge of in famke?
I wanted more than anything was mine.	Ik woe mear hawwe as wat fan my wie.
They can hardly believe it.	Se kinne it hast net leauwe.
The other returned home.	De oare werom nei hûs.
I look at the guy.	Ik sjoch de keardel oan.
It was not ready yet.	It wie noch net klear.
I'm so little at home.	Ik bin sa'n bytsje thús.
I love my dog.	Ik hâld fan myn hûn.
She used to work for you.	Se wurke eartiids foar dy.
Just like he had.	Krekt as hy hie.
I want to.	Ik wol.
It did not feel right.	It fielde net goed.
We can find them.	Wy kinne se fine.
No one here would do that.	Nimmen hjir soe dat dwaan.
They go out there and do their job.	Se geane der út en dogge har wurk.
It set me up again for the day.	It sette my wer op foar de dei.
He was never the same again.	Hy wie nea wer deselde.
He has so many people to look after him.	Hy hat safolle minsken om nei him te sjen.
Or under them.	Of ûnder har.
It happened a long time ago.	It barde lang lyn.
That's what my friend liked to say.	Dat sei myn freon graach.
Do you want to join us ?.	Wolle jo mei ús?.
He used to be pretty hard on himself.	Hy wie eartiids frij hurd foar himsels.
If this, do so.	As dit, doch dat.
We can through this.	Wy kinne troch dit.
Please, get out of the way!	Asjebleaft, gean út 'e wei!
I did not like him a bit.	Ik mocht him net in bytsje.
I had to talk to you.	Ik moast mei dy prate.
I had never heard of it.	Ik hie der noch noait fan heard.
He really wants to be with her.	Hy wol echt by har wêze.
This time it was different.	Dizze kear wie it oars.
She did not seem to have been there before.	Se like der net earder west te hawwen.
He did not have to be with her.	Hy hoegde net by har te wêzen.
I have a lot to do.	Ik haw in protte te dwaan.
Is that something.	Is dat wat.
Are you a man or a woman?	Binne jo in man of in frou?
I've been too scared.	Ik haw te bang west.
I think you will be happy to see him.	Ik tink dat jo bliid sille wêze om him te sjen.
I have tried, believe me.	Ik haw besocht, leau my.
Just try it out.	Besykje it mar út.
My dad made me go.	Myn heit makke my gean.
He must be tired!	Hy moat wurch wêze!
Or would like to do.	Of wol graach dwaan.
A few have even tried.	In pear hawwe sels besocht.
They are not necessary.	Se binne net nedich.
Of course, we can do nothing.	Fansels kinne wy ​​neat dwaan.
Maybe you did not know that.	Miskien wisten jo dat net.
We will not be afraid.	Wy sille net bang wêze.
But you can make them.	Mar jo kinne se meitsje.
He came back to bed in my room.	Hy kaam wer op bêd yn myn keamer.
Or not, it's up to you.	Of net, it is oan jo.
They want money, she thought.	Se wolle jild, tocht se.
Come on, there's food.	Kom, der is iten.
Everything is gone.	Alles is fuort.
They never work.	Se wurkje noait.
I had found a family, a family had found me.	Ik hie in famylje fûn, in famylje hie my fûn.
Well, not really.	No, net echt.
I've seen her.	Ik haw har sjoen.
Have you heard before?	Hawwe jo earder heard?
When to eat.	Wannear te iten.
All who knew her knew the truth.	Allegear dy't har wisten, wisten de wierheid.
We love her, had two of those.	Wy hâlde fan har, hiene twa fan dy.
Or, you can go for it.	Of, jo kinne der foar gean.
He has class.	Hy hat klasse.
The boy was ready, of course.	De jonge wie klear, fansels.
There was still something to do.	Der wie noch wat te dwaan.
It would be nice.	It soe aardich wêze.
I think you did.	Ik tink dat jo dien hawwe.
But it's still not true.	Mar it is noch altyd net wier.
I've never seen you.	Ik haw dy nea sjoen.
Her best friend could not help it here.	Har bêste freon koe hjir net helpe.
Many and many thoughts.	In protte en in protte gedachten.
Even if he is sick, he will work today.	Ek al is er siik, hy sil hjoed wurkje.
As if he did not know exactly what he was doing.	As wist er net krekt wat er dien hat.
There, there, mum worried.	Dêr, dêr, soargen mem.
My kids eat.	Myn bern ite.
But it's gone now.	Mar it is no fuort.
Let's get some food now.	Litte wy no wat iten krije.
I had not thought of it since that time.	Ik hie der sûnt dy tiid net oan tocht.
It was my first time seeing it as a whole work.	It wie myn earste kear dat ik it as in hiele wurk seach.
But of course you have to do what you think is right.	Mar fansels moatte jo dwaan wat jo goed tinke.
We can win.	Wy kinne winne.
Maybe it was her hair.	Miskien wie it har hier.
What is the matter? 	Wat is der oan de hân?
he asked.	hy frege.
It's an under the.	It is in ûnder de.
He could not even speak.	Hy koe net iens prate.
I will not talk to you about it.	Ik sil der net mei dy oer prate.
There were in my school, too.	Der wiene yn myn skoalle, te.
I'm not quite sure why that is.	Ik bin der net hielendal wis fan wêrom dat is.
It shows you what you need when you need it.	It lit jo sjen wat jo nedich binne as jo it nedich binne.
He thought of his children.	Hy tocht oan syn bern.
I have a large family.	Ik haw in grutte famylje.
It should not be too difficult to talk about them here.	It soe net te dreech wêze moatte om se hjir oer te praten.
They would only talk about my hair.	Se soene allinnich oer myn hier prate.
You really do.	Jo echt dwaan.
It will be fun.	It sil leuk wêze.
That will come from there.	Dat sil der fan komme.
He knew that, if anyone did.	Hy wist dat, as immen it die.
The bus arrived late.	De bus kaam te let.
Never quite happened.	Nea hielendal bard.
Evening arrived.	Jûn kaam der oan.
She was not sure what to do now.	Se wie net wis wat se no dwaan moast.
They never did anything.	Se diene noait wat.
So he set off to find real food.	Sa sette er ôf om echt iten te finen.
Everyone has today.	Elkenien hat hjoed de dei.
I'm talking about the kids.	Ik praat oer de bern.
She loves children.	Se hâldt fan bern.
You both, so make sure you know what's best for everyone.	Jo beide, sa wis dat jo witte wat it bêste is foar elkenien.
It's my absolute favorite.	It is myn heul favorite.
Or someone.	Of immen.
I want nothing.	Ik wol neat.
Why is a good question.	Wêrom is in goede fraach.
You have my word.	Do hast myn wurd.
This had to be the place.	Dit moast it plak wêze.
I even agreed with it.	Ik wie der sels mei iens.
All this, this time.	Dit alles, dizze kear.
Which has never happened before.	Wat noch noait earder bard is.
He could not ask.	Hy koe net freegje.
You can visit him a lot.	Jo kinne him in protte besykje.
About the family.	Oer de famylje.
I'm never alone.	Ik bin nea allinnich.
And it makes me wonder why.	En it makket my ôf wêrom.
I feel really bad.	Ik fiel my echt min.
It's hard to say now.	It is no dreech te sizzen.
I know you do.	Ik wit dat jo dogge.
They just have to find it.	Se moatte it gewoan fine.
I still remember you.	Ik tink noch oan dy.
Do not go there.	Gean der net hinne.
He waited for her.	Hy wachte op har.
They can not, can they?	Dat kinne se net, wol?
And that was about it.	En dat wie der oer.
I have no idea how.	Ik haw gjin idee hoe.
She is always there for me.	Se is der altyd foar my.
The more she said it, the more it made.	Hoe mear se it sei, hoe mear it makke.
Everyone has to do their job.	Elkenien moat har wurk dwaan.
You can not get away with this.	Jo kinne net fuort mei dit.
I thought it was my time.	Ik tocht dat it myn tiid wie.
We will be there.	Wy sille der wêze.
But she had not come.	Mar se wie net kommen.
Think about that for next time.	Tink dat mar foar de folgjende kear.
I thought it was very good.	Ik tocht dat it hiel goed wie.
Not with these people.	Net mei dizze minsken.
But it can not be.	Mar it kin net wêze.
I'll do this.	Ik sil dit dwaan.
They knew they would find food here.	Se wisten dat se hjir iten fine soene.
They can say something.	Se kinne wat sizze.
There are things you do not know.	D'r binne dingen dy't jo net witte.
The latter did not seem too happy to see him again.	De lêste like net al te bliid om him wer te sjen.
How many years have you lived here?	Hoefolle jier hawwe jo hjir wenne?
Think for once.	Tink foar ien kear.
I think we'll see.	Ik tink dat wy sille sjen.
See this is a girl to me.	Sjoch dit is in famke foar my.
It's time we stopped doing that to you.	It wurdt tiid dat wy ophâlde dat oan dy te dwaan.
Just a bed.	Krekt in bêd.
I need money to buy food.	Ik ha jild nedich om iten te keapjen.
There must be.	Der moat wêze.
Two people approach her.	Twa minsken komme op har ta.
I have to stop.	Ik moat ophâlde.
There are no words.	Der binne gjin wurden.
What time will it be?	Hoe let sil it wêze?
It seems to me that you are wrong.	It liket my ta dat jo ferkeard binne.
I should help.	Ik soe helpe moatte.
For me, it really works.	Foar my wurket it echt.
We'll see who has the last word here.	Wy sille sjen wa't hjir it lêste wurd hat.
They are not only wrong.	Se binne net allinnich ferkeard.
This dog has done so well.	Dizze hûn hat it sa goed dien.
The teacher was angry.	De learaar wie lilk.
He will be back.	Hy sil werom wêze.
What he said is just not true.	Wat hy sei is gewoan net wier.
I tried to do things.	Ik besocht dingen te dwaan.
You would need.	Jo soene nedich hawwe.
More about that here.	Mear oer dat hjir.
What we got was something very different.	Wat wy krigen wie wat hiel oars.
The best ever.	It bêste ea.
Boy were we wrong.	Jonge wiene wy ​​ferkeard.
Do not believe them.	Leau se net.
We can find him.	Wy kinne him fine.
At first it was not true.	Earst wie it net wier.
It is not necessary.	It is net nedich.
Then there are the people.	Dan binne der de minsken.
I would not go home.	Ik soe net nei hûs.
But, that has not been done yet.	Mar, dat is noch net dien.
All ready.	Allegear klear.
If it's mine.	As is it fan my.
But there are still a few people left.	Mar der binne noch in pear minsken oer.
I'm not going that way.	Ik gean net by dy wei.
They have to go to school.	Se moatte nei skoalle.
And not just an idea.	En net allinnich in idee.
These are beautiful.	Dizze binne moai.
He's too good for me.	Hy is te goed foar my.
Now everything felt different to her.	No fielde alles oan har oars.
We both worked on it to make it work.	Wy hawwe der beide oan wurke om it wurk te meitsjen.
Of course not for the man.	Fansels net foar de man.
Everyone thought it was better to stick to what works.	Elkenien tocht dat it better wie om te bliuwen by wat wurket.
There is not much else to say.	Der is net folle oars te sizzen.
I really do not know what is best.	Ik wit echt net wat it bêste is.
Maybe it's the time of year.	Miskien is it de tiid fan it jier.
It's a good book, if you ask me.	It is in goed boek, as jo it my freegje.
She walked away and he stayed.	Se gie fuort en hy bleau.
I have two questions about that.	Ik haw dêr twa fragen oer.
No one else knows.	Nimmen oars mei it witte.
We just do not.	Wy gewoan net.
And maybe that was it too.	En miskien wie dat ek wol.
They will not come.	Se sille net komme.
Do not eat too much.	Net te folle ite.
Knew what interested her too.	Wist wat har ek ynteressearre.
I think about this pretty hard.	Ik tink oer dit moai hurd.
He did not know what to do to help.	Hy wist net wat er dwaan moast om te helpen.
I wanted to find a job in the city.	Ik woe in baan fine yn 'e stêd.
I even talked to her a few times.	Ik ha sels in pear kear mei har praat.
You did the right thing.	Jo hawwe it goede dien.
That said, scared.	Dat sei se, bang.
I do not think we can do more than that.	Ik tink net dat wy mear kinne dwaan as dat.
They can actually be ready.	Se kinne eins wurde klear.
And if you did not hear it, you would love it too.	En as jo it net heard hawwe, soene jo it ek leuk fine.
That was the truth, she seemed happy, she was happy.	Dat wie de wierheid, se like bliid, se wie bliid.
Time, there just never seems to be enough.	Tiid, der liket gewoan noait genôch te wêzen.
I love how hard it is.	Ik hâld fan hoe dreech it is.
But no one else did.	Mar nimmen oars die.
I see no reason why you should not do something that way.	Ik sjoch gjin reden wêrom't jo net wat dogge op dy manier.
Didn't think it would work.	Hie net tocht dat it soe wurkje.
But they were not there.	Mar se wiene der net.
We need to help her.	Wy moatte har helpe.
Maybe they should.	Miskien moatte se.
I can not have this in my house.	Ik kin dit net yn myn hûs hawwe.
Just always through everything there.	Krekt altyd troch alles dêr.
They are neither.	Se binne gjin fan beide.
Those things were enough for him.	Dy dingen wiene him genôch.
Well, that's them.	No, dat binne se.
We are humans and were in this together.	Wy binne minsken en wiene yn dit tegearre.
The problem with all of this is time.	It probleem mei dit alles is tiid.
How was your weekend?	Hoe wie dyn wykein?
To find what they once had.	Om te finen wat se eartiids hiene.
Until she had not.	Oant se net hie.
The man worked.	De man wurke.
Tell them they are ready to go in one hour.	Fertel se dat se klear binne om yn ien oere te gean.
So she could tell everyone.	Sa koe se elkenien fertelle.
She is here and interested in the work.	Se is hjir en ynteressearre yn it wurk.
I opened his door.	Ik die syn doar iepen.
I know you can not talk about it.	Ik wit dat jo der net oer prate kinne.
I'm just not there yet.	Ik bin der gewoan noch net.
I wore nothing.	Ik siet neat oan.
It just had to happen.	It moast gewoan barre.
People will pay for everything.	Minsken sille der alles foar betelje.
He lets her go.	Hy lit har gean.
You're a woman.	Do bist in frou.
That's for my dad.	Dat is foar myn heit.
She becomes three.	Se wurdt trije.
Everything he said was true.	Alles wat hy sei wie wier.
I have to go.	Ik moat gean.
I think you did a good job.	Ik tink dat jo in goed wurk dien hawwe.
By doing this.	Troch dit te dwaan.
But there was that other thing he said.	Mar der wie dat oare ding dat er sei.
She felt happy.	Se fielde har bliid.
He never talked about it.	Hy hat der noait oer praat.
She looked around in surprise.	Se seach ferrast om.
That, of course, is not the point.	Dêr komt it fansels net op.
Children think that anyone who is bad is very bad.	Bern tinke dat elkenien dy't min is tige min is.
He looked around the room.	Hy seach de keamer om.
That would have been her, she thought.	Dat soe har west hawwe, tocht se.
Look what you did to me!	Sjoch wat jo my dien hawwe!
It just will not happen.	It sil gewoan net barre.
To get back to school.	Om nei skoalle werom te kommen.
That was what she wanted.	Dit wie wat se woe.
And he would be free to love anyone else.	En hy soe frij wêze om fan immen oars te hâlden.
It is clear that she does not need much.	It is dúdlik dat se net folle nedich is.
I agree, but he was now for whatever reason.	Ik bin it iens, mar hy wie no om hokker reden dan ek.
If he really wants to, he will work for it.	As er it echt wol, sil er der foar wurkje.
He has his husband.	Hy hat syn man.
I'm glad you said that, my friend.	Ik bin bliid dat jo dat sein hawwe, myn freon.
He does not look well.	Hy liket net goed.
He thought of all the things he should have said.	Hy tocht oan alle dingen dy't er sizze moatten hawwe.
They must have.	Se moatte hawwe.
I'm so sorry.	It spyt my tige.
And no one talks about their past.	En gjinien praat oer har ferline.
I do not see how it can go wrong, really.	Ik sjoch net hoe't it ferkeard gean kin, echt.
And what they are now.	En wat se no binne.
I take some of that back.	Dêr nim ik wat fan werom.
It happens for last month.	It bart foar ferline moanne.
If we go in there now, we will not get out.	As wy der no yn geane, komme wy net út.
I would not do it, whatever.	Ik soe it net dwaan, wat dan ek.
People do not want to know.	Minsken wolle it net witte.
We are still in the making.	Wy binne noch yn it meitsjen.
Do not agree with you there.	Net it mei dy iens dêr.
These are things we know we know.	Dit binne dingen dy't wy witte dat wy witte.
Do you want to go with me?	Wolle jo mei my gean?
You've only heard one.	Jo hawwe mar ien heard.
I wonder what they make of it.	Ik freegje my ôf wat se der fan meitsje.
If not, well not.	As net, goed net.
Or else we must leave.	Of oars moatte wy fuort.
It's just not fun anymore.	It is gewoan net leuk mear.
Thing really gave her a good job.	Ding joech har echt in goed wurk oer.
So you have to tell me what to do.	Sa moatte jo my fertelle wat te dwaan.
They had faith.	Se hiene it leauwe.
Try not to eat them.	Besykje se net te iten.
He gave her the money at once, but they did not stop.	Hy joech har it jild yn ien kear, mar se hâlde net op.
It involves.	It hâldt yn .
We can not wait for our friends.	Wy kinne net wachtsje op ús freonen.
He saw that too.	Dat seach er ek.
We need to know what to do.	Wy moatte witte wat te dwaan.
We now know we can.	Wy witte no dat wy kinne.
I wanted money.	Ik woe jild.
I have never been without one since.	Ik haw nea west sûnder ien sûnt.
So we're just going to get involved.	Dat wy geane der gewoan troch mei te dwaan.
This can be a great opportunity for us to become friends.	Dit kin in goede kâns wêze foar ús om freonen te wurden.
But she works for me.	Mar se wurket foar my.
Nothing is certain in this life.	Neat is wis yn dit libben.
Just go there.	Gean der mar hinne.
You get to bed.	Jo komme op bêd.
Help me here, people !.	Help my hjir, minsken!.
I do not know what time it is.	Ik wit net hoe let it is.
On we go.	Op wy gean.
On its own, that was not a real problem.	Op himsels wie dat gjin echt probleem.
No work to do.	Gjin wurk te dwaan.
It is as sick as getting sick.	It is sa siik as siik wurdt.
But this time she did not look at me.	Mar dizze kear seach se my net oan.
That's where we are now.	Dat is wêr't wy no binne.
We are free, can do whatever we want.	Wy binne frij, kinne alles dwaan wat wy wolle.
Come and join us.	Kom en doch mei.
I always did.	Dat die ik altyd.
Make it together, girl.	Meitsje it tegearre, famke.
Nobody wakes up.	Nimmen wurdt wekker.
So tell me the truth.	Sa fertel my de wierheid.
For everything really.	Foar alles echt.
Then they are angry.	Dan binne se lilk.
Is he still angry with you?	Is er noch lilk op dy?
Someone she knows, more or less.	Ien dy't se ken, min of mear.
That, of course, is good.	Dat is fansels goed.
Think of tomorrow.	Tink oan moarn.
Many people say that nothing can be done.	In protte minsken sizze dat der neat dien wurde kin.
What these people are being told now.	Wat dizze minsken no ferteld wurde.
She does not have to look at him like that.	Se hoecht him net sa oan te sjen.
I doubt they really love me.	Ik twifelje oan dat se echt fan my hâlde.
Not sure if it's the best idea or not.	Net wis oft it is it bêste idee of net.
As much as it hurts me to say this.	Safolle as it my sear docht dit te sizzen.
For the first week, it was good.	Foar de earste wike wie it goed.
I said nothing.	Ik sei neat.
There was none.	Der wie gjinien.
Just your money, and that's it.	Krekt dyn jild, en dat is it.
I never could do that now.	Dat koe ik no noait.
No day is ever long enough.	Gjin dei is oait lang genôch.
They have a plan.	Se hawwe in plan.
I'm very tired.	Ik bin tige wurch.
It was just what had happened.	It wie gewoan wat dat bard wie.
I could not do it.	Ik koe it net dwaan.
She was tired.	Se wie wurch.
And she could not come late.	En se koe der net let op komme.
Too much as one on one.	Te folle as ien op ien.
No one will help you with this.	Nimmen sil jo helpe mei dizze.
She found none.	Se fûn nimmen.
He found two.	Hy fûn twa.
I'll give him this and this,	Ik sil him dit en dit jaan,
Need some help.	Wat help nedich.
He's in his room.	Hy is yn syn keamer.
It works for me.	It wurket foar my.
I know where they are.	Ik wit wêr't se binne.
You can have it.	Jo kinne it hawwe.
I do not want to be alone.	Ik wol net allinnich wêze.
Do not speak to me.	Praat net tsjin my.
Someone or something watching.	Immen of wat sjocht nei.
She said it would be good.	Se sei dat it goed soe wêze.
He will have to help us.	Hy sil ús helpe moatte.
You did nothing wrong.	Do hast neat ferkeard dien.
So we can get back to that.	Sa kinne wy ​​der op werom komme.
He's not with it.	Hy is der net mei.
It had only become words.	It wiene allinnich wurden.
Everyone knows about them.	Elkenien wit oer har.
Not the police, not the police.	Net de plysje, net de plysje.
During the year, the boy had many friends.	Yn it jier, de jonge hie in protte freonen.
A little bit.	In bytsje.
I know it can be hard to get here.	Ik wit dat it dreech kin wêze om hjir te kommen.
And he laid his hand on it.	En hy joech syn hân oan.
It just does not work.	It wurket gewoan net.
Hope you do not have to come here.	Hoopje dat jo hjir net hoege te kommen.
That's what they'll see.	Dat sille se sjen.
To get to this place.	Om nei dit plak te kommen.
This is not easy for me to do.	Dit is net maklik foar my om te dwaan.
I can handle anything.	Ik kin alles oan.
That day was not long ago, probably.	Dy dei wie net lang lyn, wierskynlik.
Up and back.	Op en werom.
But not everything.	Mar net alles.
She had actually said it.	Se hie it eins sein.
They are of him and in him.	Se binne fan him en yn him.
It's good to see you again.	It is goed om dy wer te sjen.
What is it like to not have a home in this place.	Wat is it om gjin thús te hawwen op dit plak.
I do not know what they did to him.	Ik wit net wat se him dien hawwe.
As if he never wanted anything.	As woe er noait wat.
It's good to be busy here.	It is goed om hjir drok te wêzen.
I was wrong to be so sure.	Ik wie ferkeard om sa wis te wêzen.
That I would like to know.	Dat soe ik graach witte wolle.
But there were many things.	Mar der wiene in protte dingen.
They can do whatever they want with you.	Se kinne dwaan wat se wolle mei dy.
I have not seen this before.	Ik haw dit noch net earder sjoen.
They did a good job of that.	Dêr diene se goed wurk fan.
I never think so about him.	Ik tink noait sa oer him.
This made my day.	Dit makke myn dei.
I just want to say.	Ik wol gewoan sizze.
Now get out of here.	No gean hjir wei.
He would have to pay.	Hy soe betelje moatte.
Everything was good, everything was good.	Alles wie goed, alles wie goed.
If you love your city more.	As jo ​​jo stêd mear hâlde.
She loves him.	Se hâldt fan him.
I could not do otherwise.	Ik koe net oars.
And now he would never let her go.	En no soe er har noait litte litte.
I've been waiting for you for almost an hour.	Ik wachte al hast in oere op dy.
Or, so it seems.	Of, sa liket it.
He left behind three children.	Hy liet trije bern nei.
I would like to talk to her today.	Ik soe hjoed mei har prate wolle.
People with no food.	Minsken mei gjin iten.
I know his children.	Ik ken syn bern.
She sat alone.	Se siet allinnich.
This the he.	Dit die hy.
As he did not.	Eins die er net.
I was out of everything.	Ik wie út alles.
I hope that happens, but you never know.	Ik hoopje dat dat bart, mar jo witte it noait.
Like nice enough.	Like moai genôch.
He was not himself.	Hy wie net himsels.
You have to keep it in mind.	Jo moatte it yn hâlde.
He turned it on and opened a book.	Hy die it oan en die in boek iepen.
We do not put our name on the door.	Wy sette ús namme net oer de doar.
That's fine.	Dat is dan wol goed.
He looks exactly like that man.	Hy liket krekt op dy man.
I'm not sure what happened now.	Ik bin der no net wis fan wat der mei bard is.
I came for something else.	Ik bin foar wat oars kommen.
And it's all coming soon.	En it komt allegear gau.
I can not believe he is working so fast.	Ik kin net leauwe dat hy sa gau wurket.
It's not how long you do something, but how often.	It is net hoe lang jo wat dogge, mar hoe faak.
And work some more.	En wurkje wat mear.
But maybe that's just as good.	Mar miskien is dat like goed.
she asked.	frege se har ôf.
Get out of the house.	Gean út it hûs.
And in that first year.	En yn dat earste jier.
It will be there.	It sil der wêze.
The thing had a name.	It ding hie in namme.
He set up another one.	Hy sette noch ien op.
You do not help.	Jo helpe net.
No one else in the house loves her.	Nimmen oars yn 'e hûs hâlde fan har.
I did not like the guy and he did not like either.	Ik mocht de keardel net en hy mocht ek net.
There was a woman, he was told.	Der wie in frou, waard him ferteld.
It's not good for us to see each other together.	It is net goed foar ús om tegearre te sjen.
They do not talk much.	Se prate net folle.
Want to show you something.	Wol dy wat sjen litte.
This is our only job.	Dit is ús ienige baan.
You are not expected.	Jo wurde net ferwachte.
Will it come to your house.	Sil it nei jo hûs komme.
Whatever you're up to, we'll not have enough time tonight.	Wat jo ek fan plan binne, wy sille fannacht net genôch tiid hawwe.
But no one knows how to get him there.	Mar nimmen wit hoe't er him dêr komme moat.
I want him back with us.	Ik wol him werom by ús.
We are different, he says to himself.	Wy binne oars, seit er tsjin himsels.
But this is wrong.	Mar dit is ferkeard.
I'm not sure yet.	Ik bin der noch net wis fan.
But that was wrong.	Mar dat wie ferkeard.
Go on with your day and whatever happens, happens.	Gean troch mei jo dei en wat der ek bart, bart.
Neither is correct.	Gjin fan beide is krekt.
Go back now.	Gean no werom.
That's how life should be.	Dat is hoe't it libben moat wêze.
Do this, do not do that.	Doch dit, doch dat net.
He opened the door and let him out of the house.	Hy die de doar iepen en liet him it hûs út.
Things are not so.	Dingen binne net sa.
For one thing, there was only one of them.	Foar ien ding wie der mar ien fan har.
I did not know what to say to these people.	Ik wist net wat ik tsjin dizze minsken sizze moast.
See what they do.	Sjoch wat se dogge.
It's like something else is coming out.	It is as komt der wat oars út.
This did not matter.	Dit makke neat út.
They do bad things.	Se dogge minne dingen.
Or, the car can be a problem.	Of, de auto kin in probleem wêze.
I'm going up there again.	Ik gean der wer op.
That's for sure.	Dat is wis.
You can, of course.	Jo kinne fansels.
But there were only him and I in the room.	Mar der wiene allinnich hy en ik yn 'e keamer.
We have nothing else to talk about.	Wy hawwe neat oars om oer te praten.
He looks at her.	Hy sjocht har oan.
For some reason, it does not.	Om ien of oare reden docht it dat net.
She was asked about her work.	Se waard frege nei har wurk.
But it was not her.	Mar it wie har net.
But it presented the same problem.	Mar it joech itselde probleem.
She's my best friend.	Se is myn bêste freon.
You know how they go.	Jo witte hoe't se gean.
She said she thought she could.	Se sei dat se tocht dat se koe.
We did him.	Wy diene him.
I'm not happy, she says.	Ik bin net bliid, seit se.
But that's wrong.	Mar dat is ferkeard.
And no one had to show me.	En nimmen moast my sjen litte.
I had these two friends in my first year.	Ik hie dizze twa freonen yn myn earste jier.
It became a family favorite.	It waard in famylje favorite.
No one comes or goes.	Nimmen komt of giet.
That has nothing to do with it.	Dat hat der neat mei te krijen.
But it was never mine.	Mar it wie nea fan my.
It's my life.	It is myn libben.
Whatever they say, you know who you are.	Wat se ek sizze, jo witte wa't jo binne.
But not much.	Mar net folle.
Please make sure you do not let them do that to me.	Soargje asjebleaft dat jo se dat net mei my dwaan litte.
I want people to like me.	Ik wol dat minsken my leuk fine.
There is no going back.	Der is gjin wei werom.
I can work on it.	Ik kin der oan wurkje.
Your parents do not know about me.	Jo âlden witte net fan my.
I'll have to get these.	Ik sil dizze moatte krije.
This work must be completed on time.	Dit wurk moat op tiid klear wêze.
I was just trying to get you there.	Ik wie krekt besocht om dy dêr.
I have to think.	Ik moat tinke.
I do not know who it may be otherwise.	Ik wit net wa't it oars wêze kin.
You have two full hours before you go to work.	Jo hawwe twa hiele oeren foardat jo nei it wurk gean.
And they can do better.	En se kinne better.
We needed it.	Wy hiene it nedich.
I'm not surprised.	Ik bin net ferrast.
But actually he had been.	Mar eins hie er west.
Lots of things here.	In protte dingen hjir.
They had not seen it.	Se hiene it net sjoen.
No one talks to her.	Nimmen prate mei har.
But it can be anything.	Mar it kin alles wêze.
Not so much ago, not even that.	Net sa folle lyn, sels dat net.
He saw her.	Hy seach har.
I really do not feel so good.	Ik fiel my echt net sa goed.
Now he knew it.	No wist er it.
There was nothing she could do about it.	Dêr koe se neat oan dwaan.
Well, that's a good movie.	No, dat is in goede film.
But it was fun !.	Mar it wie leuk!.
This man is very sick.	Dizze man is tige siik.
I just do not know how to make it so.	Ik wit gewoan net hoe ik it sa meitsje moat.
But neither does life.	Mar it libben ek net.
Just know this.	Wit dit gewoan.
They had not met her for a few years.	Se hiene har in pear jier net moete.
I want it out.	Ik wol dat it út is.
Be here now.	No hjir wêze.
We decided we should try to make them.	Wy besletten dat wy moatte besykje te meitsjen se.
I knew it could not be easy.	Ik wist dat it net maklik wêze koe.
I do not see why they would do that.	Ik sjoch net wêrom se dat soene.
We need to be told.	Wy moatte wurde ferteld.
This year is different.	Dit jier is oars.
Whether she was home now, worried.	Oft se no thús wie, soargen.
Not so much in a bad way.	Net sa folle op in minne manier.
She did not know what else to do.	Se wist net wat se oars dwaan moast.
They would need them next year.	Se soene se takom jier nedich hawwe.
Their children do the same.	Har bern dogge itselde.
She made it clear to him that he was not.	Se makke him dúdlik dat er net wie.
Now there's a fun idea.	No is der in leuk idee.
They can go for that.	Dêr kinne se wol foar gean.
He was not such a man.	Hy wie net sa'n man.
What hurt him was what his parents did.	Wat him sear die wie wat syn âlden diene.
I needed a car.	Ik hie in auto nedich.
We're glad you found a job.	Wy binne bliid dat jo in baan fûn hawwe.
It was hard to say who heard anything.	It wie min te sizzen wa't wat hearde.
I told you it did not work the first time.	Ik sei dy dat it de earste kear net wurke.
He knew what she wanted.	Hy wist wat se woe.
Think about the person you are.	Tink oer de persoan dy't jo binne.
Well, let's see.	No, lit ús sjen.
I'll be back tomorrow.	Ik kom moarn werom.
It does not happen twice.	It komt net twa kear.
That's what I wanted.	Dat woe ik wol.
Come over with enough time.	Kom mei genôch tiid oer.
You need to know this.	Jo moatte dit witte.
She really wanted to believe him.	Se woe him eins wol leauwe.
He seemed like a good kid.	Hy like wol in goed bern.
But they know that.	Mar dat witte se.
They just look happy.	Se lykje gewoan bliid.
I bought this book.	Ik kocht dit boek.
They will never see.	Se sille nea sjen.
Just give these people a try!	Jou dizze minsken gewoan in kâns!
There are enough people out there.	Der binne genôch minsken út dêr.
We know what you've done.	Wy witte wat jo dien hawwe.
It's something about my hair.	It is wat oer myn hier.
But it does not have to be that way.	Mar it hoecht net sa te wêzen.
You've heard of him.	Jo hawwe fan him heard.
She knew no one there, and no one knew her.	Se koe dêr gjinien, en nimmen koe har.
I do not want any of you.	Ik wol gjinien fan dy.
I do not want her to worry.	Ik wol net dat se har soargen makket.
But maybe she would have.	Mar miskien soe se hawwe.
I'm almost going back.	Ik gean hast werom.
Talk to her and tell her about your problems.	Praat mei har en fertel har oer jo problemen.
But he is not even sure of that.	Mar dêr is er net iens wis fan.
It was much too late for that.	Dêr wie it folle te let foar.
He was not in it.	Hy wie der net yn.
I was the problem.	Ik wie it probleem.
You're scared of him.	Do bist bang foar him.
You're doing it right.	Jo dogge it goed.
An hour away from me.	In oere fan my ôf.
Let me do it this way.	Lit my it op dizze manier dwaan.
I know my father.	Ik ken myn heit.
I have nothing to do in my life.	Ik haw neat te dwaan yn myn libben.
She looked out the door of the house.	Se seach de doar fan it hûs út.
She can say it could be better.	Se kin sizze dat it better kin.
Is that good?	Is dat goed?.
The man is said to be ill.	Der wurdt sein dat de man siik is.
The first time here.	De earste kear hjir.
We do not have much time.	Wy hawwe net folle tiid.
He could not help who he was.	Hy koe net helpe wa't er wie.
That's all that's been working so far.	Dat is alles wat oant no ta wurket.
She said she could do without her.	Se sei dat se sûnder har koe dwaan.
It felt a little wrong.	It fielde in bytsje ferkeard oan.
She arrived late at the meeting.	Se kaam te let op 'e gearkomste.
It probably had nothing to do with him.	It hie wierskynlik neat mei him te krijen.
You got him here just in time.	Jo hawwe him hjir krekt op 'e tiid.
And look at me now.	En sjoch my no.
Come back with me.	Kom werom mei my.
He had only met her once before.	Hy hie har mar ien kear earder moete.
It would probably be best if we did not tell someone.	It soe wierskynlik it bêste wêze as wy it net oan ien fertelle.
Let me know if he needs anything.	Lit my witte as hy wat nedich is.
Whether it is a.	Oft it is in.
It will not stay.	It sil net bliuwe.
She told me things were busy.	Se fertelde my dat dingen drok wiene.
There was never a problem.	Der wie nea gjin probleem.
As is my husband.	As is myn man.
I will go with you if you want.	Ik sil mei jo gean as jo wolle.
I think there are a few things.	Ik tink dat d'r in pear dingen binne.
I have to say that there are many and more things.	Ik moat sizze dat der in protte en mear dingen binne.
I still do not.	Ik noch altyd net.
Do not like you, not really.	Net fan dy hâlde, net echt.
I did not find that last time.	Dat fûn ik de lêste kear net.
Do not try to say that you will not either.	Besykje net te sizzen dat jo ek net sille.
Tell him everything is going well here.	Fertel him dat alles hjir goed giet.
He looked at her for a long time.	Hy seach har lang oan.
And he grew old.	En hy waard âld.
They ate out.	Se ha der út iten.
With more hair.	Mei mear hier.
We worry.	Wy meitsje ús soargen.
He's never scared.	Hy is nea bang.
Now they had.	No hiene se.
We just can not agree.	Wy kinne it gewoan net iens wêze.
But one day.	Mar ien dei.
He tried to talk.	Hy besocht te praten.
Ask for help if you need it.	Freegje om help as jo it nedich hawwe.
I believe it will be.	Ik leau dat it sil wêze.
I was bad too.	Ik wie ek min.
It's up to us.	It is op ús.
In other words, work from now on back in time.	Mei oare wurden, wurkje fan it no werom yn de tiid.
No more time.	Gjin tiid mear.
People were angry at her.	Minsken wiene lilk op har.
People tell me that.	Minsken fertelle my dat.
I need it.	Ik ha it nedich.
Nothing was done.	Der waard neat dien.
And, well, that's another person.	En, goed, dat is in oare persoan.
He was not much.	Hy wie net folle.
That was nice.	Dat wie moai.
I was so scared of her.	Ik wie sa bang foar har.
Not much, really.	Net folle, echt.
Not like this morning.	Net as dizze moarn.
It is not necessary.	It is net nedich.
We are why they have their work.	Wy binne wêrom't se har wurk hawwe.
That they would try.	Dat se soene besykje.
If not make it.	As net meitsje it.
I also feel better.	Ik fiel my ek better.
Can do the same for tomorrow.	Kin ek foar moarn itselde dwaan.
Too much fun about it.	In protte te leuk oer it.
The girl is back.	It famke is werom.
There was something off.	Der wie wat ôf.
You do it or you do not do it.	Jo dogge it of jo dogge it net.
But it's time to go.	Mar it komt tiid dat it giet.
He speaks to himself.	Hy prate tsjin himsels.
But now you too will be free.	Mar no sille jo ek frij wêze.
Do not always believe what people tell you.	Leau net altyd wat minsken jo fertelle.
They were old and had never lived there.	Se wiene âld en hiene der nea wenne.
It's a custom we're made of.	It is in gewoan dat wy binne makke.
I feel like a lake.	Ik fiel in mar.
Only, he's a little late.	Allinnich, hy is wat let.
But no need to worry about this week.	Mar net hoege te soargen oer dizze wike.
Even without the dog.	Ek sûnder de hûn.
It would be.	It soe wêze.
It was just those three.	It wiene krekt dy trije.
It is always beautiful and will remain so forever.	It is altyd moai en sil sa bliuwe foar altyd.
That's my plan for today.	Dat is myn plan foar hjoed.
There is, of course, a reason for that.	Dêr is fansels in reden foar.
And you want to be like that.	En jo wolle sa wêze.
It was such an evening.	It wie sa'n jûn.
I can get a job, if need be.	Ik kin in baan krije, as it moat.
But it will do more.	Mar it sil mear dwaan.
That does not make it easy.	Dat makket it net maklik.
She should do it.	Se soe it dwaan moatte.
I was really happy with it, actually.	Ik wie der echt bliid mei, eins.
To be with me.	Om by my te wêzen.
And they do not hold back.	En se hâlde har net tsjin.
And maybe it was true.	En miskien wie it wier.
The truth is not just one thing.	De wierheid is net mar ien ding.
He was happy to tell me.	Hy wie bliid om my te fertellen.
I did not like the question.	Ik fûn de fraach net leuk.
And he probably needed help.	En hy hie wierskynlik help nedich.
He even had to get out.	Hy moast sels út.
I'll be working late tonight.	Ik sil fannacht let wurkje.
They could not see us, but we could see them.	Se koene ús net sjen, mar wy koene se sjen.
Give and take.	Jaan en nimme.
I'm just waiting it out.	Ik wachtsje it mar ôf.
It's just that everyone wants to be their friend.	It is gewoan dat elkenien har freon wêze wol.
Same with this one.	Itselde mei dizze.
It did something.	It die wat.
That is, so far.	Dat is, oant no ta.
She really did not know what to expect.	Se wist eins net wat se ferwachte hie.
She saw it twice.	Se seach it twa kear.
I would love to have them and keep them.	Ik soe graach hawwe se te hawwen en te hâlden.
Well, not at all.	No, net hielendal.
It would not work.	It soe net wurkje.
This was what friends did, he thought.	Dit wie wat freonen diene, tocht er.
Did you work late last night?	Hawwe jo jûn let wurke?
So beautiful, he thought.	Sa moai, tocht er.
But there are things we know more about than they do.	Mar d'r binne dingen dy't wy mear witte as se oer dogge.
I think it is now.	Ik tink dat it no is.
Her father was gone.	Har heit wie fuort.
She would not want him to be like that.	Se soe net wolle dat er sa wie.
You have everything.	Jo hawwe alles.
Well, that's it, really.	No, dat is it, echt.
You can see kids in school.	Jo kinne bern yn 'e skoalle sjen.
He has had enough.	Hy hat genôch.
But she wanted to say one thing.	Mar se woe wol ien ding sizze.
I'll tell you about it as a friend.	Ik sil it dy fertelle as freon.
All do the same.	Allegear dogge itselde.
No one asked why.	Nimmen frege wêrom.
It was pretty easy.	It wie frij maklik.
Who will be the best?	Wa sil de bêste wêze?
This is what life is like now.	Dit is wat it libben is no.
Of course, something more was expected of them.	Fansels waard der wat mear fan har ferwachte.
It's what gets us through it.	It is wat ús der troch komt.
Mar har.	Mar har.
That time was not like today.	Dy tiid wie net as hjoed.
I walked out of the room.	Ik rûn de keamer út.
I'm glad we got the chance to become friends.	Ik bin bliid dat wy de kâns krigen hawwe om freonen te wurden.
And you may not be in a few years.	En jo binne miskien net oer in pear jier.
He took his time.	Hy naam syn tiid.
I'm so tired!	Ik bin sa wurch!
He would need more money.	Hy soe mear jild nedich hawwe.
Well, they had never told us that.	No, dat hiene se ús noait ferteld.
I tried to be a good husband and father.	Ik besocht in goede man en heit te wêzen.
He needs those things.	Hy hat dy dingen nedich.
He said he would wait for me.	Hy sei dat er op my wachtsje soe.
He was never afraid to express his thoughts.	Hy wie nea bang om syn gedachten te sizzen.
You do your job and leave everything else to us.	Jo dogge jo wurk en lit al it oare oan ús oer.
I will buy another one of these.	Ik sil noch ien fan dizze keapje.
That will not be done easily.	Dat sil net maklik dien wurde.
True, we do.	Wier, wy dogge.
You have to do this one by one.	Jo moatte dit ien foar ien dwaan.
There was absolutely nothing against it.	Der wie hielendal neat op tsjin.
It probably did not matter.	It makke wierskynlik net út.
What is the reason for that.	Wat is de reden dat.
I could see where this was going.	Ik koe sjen wêr't dit hinne gie.
Same kind of idea.	Itselde soarte idee.
Maybe we should talk another time.	Miskien moatte wy in oare kear prate.
She is so sure of everything.	Se is sa wis fan alles.
It should not have happened.	It hie net barre moatten.
I did get over it though.	Ik kaam der wol oer.
She let the boy go.	Se liet de jonge gean.
She never said what she just wanted to do.	Se die noait wat se net dwaan woe.
No one could love that boy more than we could.	Nimmen koe mear fan dy jonge hâlde as wy.
It really is a whole picture.	It is echt in hiele foto.
If you want to, of course.	As jo ​​wolle, fansels.
This is what we have become.	Dit is wat wy wurden binne.
He was old.	Hy wie âld.
You have to do something yourself.	Jo moatte sels wat dwaan.
Otherwise you can never see it.	Oars kinne jo it noait sjen.
I think it's his name.	Ik tink dat it syn namme is.
Just bad.	Gewoan min.
But this does not seem to be the right way to do it.	Mar dit liket net de goede manier om dit te dwaan.
If so, we are ready.	As dat sa is, binne wy ​​klear.
I have tried it myself.	Ik haw it sels besocht.
Until it.	Oant it.
My wife said it was probably time to go home.	Myn frou sei dat it wierskynlik tiid wie om nei hûs te gean.
Hurry up, otherwise we'll be late for school!	Hast op, oars komme wy te let op skoalle!
He could only go home and wait for the word.	Hy koe allinnich nei hûs gean en wachtsje op it wurd.
He says he does.	Hy seit dat hy dat docht.
I do not do it.	Ik doch it net.
I did not wait any longer.	Ik wachte net mear.
Know him better.	Ken him better.
I still know well.	Ik wit noch goed.
First we move on.	Earst geane wy ​​oan.
He seemed interested, though he did not say much.	Hy like ynteressearre, al sei er net folle.
Otherwise it is not.	Oars is it net.
And the truth was, she could never be.	En de wierheid wie, se soe noait wêze kinne.
Yeah, you have not and it's just not good.	Jo, jo hawwe net en it is gewoan net goed.
It had never been necessary.	It hie nea nedich west.
Who clearly felt that everything was fine.	Dy't dúdlik fielde dat alles goed wie.
She will show it to us when she comes here.	Se sil it ús sjen litte as se hjir komt.
She just said she was tired.	Se sei krekt dat se wurch wie.
No chance at it.	Gjin kâns op it.
Your parents will never know.	Jo âlden sille it noait witte.
And it's beautiful.	En it is moai.
This thing is difficult.	Dit ding is dreech.
He liked the idea of ​​that.	Hy mocht it idee fan dat.
We want nothing to do with it.	Wy wolle der neat mei ha.
And take me with you.	En nim my mei.
More true to life.	Mear wier oan it libben.
It's just bad.	It is gewoan min.
There is no way to make money.	D'r is gjin manier om jild te meitsjen.
You can never have too many friends.	Jo kinne noait te folle freonen hawwe.
A year earlier, he had set up his job.	In jier earder sette er syn baan op.
She should be easy to find.	Se soe maklik te finen wêze moatte.
It was out of the question.	It wie út 'e fraach.
Easy as that.	Maklik as dat.
You should have seen my house.	Do hiest myn hûs sjen moatten.
The problem is the money.	It probleem is it jild.
There is even a name for it.	Der is sels in namme foar.
See where he goes, what he does.	Sjoch wêr't hy giet, wat hy docht.
She could not stop.	Se koe net ophâlde.
He thought he had nothing to do with it.	Hy tocht dat er der neat oan hie.
That man is not in that room.	Dy man is net yn dy keamer.
It's more than that.	It is mear as dat.
She will wait when you are ready.	Se sil wachtsje as jo klear binne.
But that may not have happened often.	Mar dat kin net faak bard wêze.
But it was this photo that someone wanted.	Mar it wie dizze foto dy't immen woe.
He was hit a few times.	Hy waard in pear kear rekke.
You may get one, or you may not.	Jo kinne krije ien, of jo miskien net.
She had to do that.	Dat moast se dwaan.
And are just three words.	En binne krekt trije wurden.
I saw him out the door and he was still scared.	Ik seach him út 'e doar en hy wie noch bang.
We'll be there soon.	Wy binne der gau.
And this book is about getting what you want.	En dit boek giet oer it krijen fan wat jo wolle.
Of course you do.	Fansels dogge jo dat.
Not much is said.	Der wurdt net folle sein.
We will do what we can to help you.	Wy sille dwaan wat wy kinne om jo te helpen.
There are other problems with that as well.	Der binne ek oare problemen mei.
I'll take care of you.	Ik sil nei dy soargje.
He lives there with his wife and two children.	Hy wennet dêr mei syn frou en twa bern.
The child is what matters.	It bern is wat it giet.
Look there, she said.	Sjoch dêr, sei se.
We stay together.	Wy bliuwe tegearre.
What's that? 	Wat is dat?
Believe me, you are wrong.	Leau my, do bist ferkeard.
I just worked.	Ik wurke gewoan.
I love what they have done with the place.	Ik hâld fan wat se mei it plak dien hawwe.
They win from us.	Se winne fan ús.
But it could not have been easy.	Mar it koe net maklik west hawwe.
The problem is.	It probleem is.
She was beautiful, so beautiful.	Se wie moai, sa moai.
It was a busy life, but a good one.	It wie in drok libben, mar in goed.
On our family.	Op ús famylje.
This is who we are, even when no one is watching !.	Dit is wa't wy binne, sels as gjinien sjocht!.
That would do nicely.	Dat soe moai dwaan.
But there was a chance.	Mar der wie in kâns.
She does not think so.	Se tinkt him net.
He's getting well.	Hy komt goed.
We never did.	Wy hawwe nea dien.
They knew him.	Se koene him.
I want to be your friend.	Ik wol dyn freon wêze.
I want you to leave this to me now.	Ik wol dat jo dit no by my litte.
One day, if you have to go, you will know it.	Op in dei, as jo gean moatte, dan sille jo it witte.
Or with you then, he said.	Of mei dy dan, sei er.
He should have come back now.	Hy hie no werom komme moatten.
Well, you should not say anything against anyone.	No, jo moatte neat tsjin ien sizze.
He did not agree.	Hy wie it net iens.
That was my life.	Dat wie myn libben.
I will not take the job.	Ik sil de baan net nimme.
You could not do that now.	Dat koene jo no net.
I do not know why, but it's true.	Ik wit net wêrom, mar it is wier.
I know who he is.	Ik wit wa't hy is.
This is not the place.	Dit is net it plak.
I came home.	Ik kaam thús.
No one should find him here.	Nimmen moat him hjir fine.
I did nothing.	Ik ha neat dien.
They were a couple, the two.	Se wiene in pear, de twa.
She was glad it had gone so well.	Se wie bliid dat it sa goed gien wie.
We were almost there.	Wy wiene hast.
It's just what happens.	It is gewoan wat der bart.
It's not true we need this man.	It is net wier dat wy dizze man nedich hawwe.
Let the children visit the door.	Lit de bern de doar besykje.
They said we could get them tomorrow.	Se seine dat wy se moarn krije kinne.
This is.	Dit is.
Where is everyone from?	Wêr is elkenien wei?
You have your money.	Jo hawwe jo jild.
It was not so much that my work was difficult.	It wie net sa folle dat myn wurk dreech wie.
All morning at home and in the office.	De hiele moarn thús en op kantoar.
But he did not know what else to do.	Mar hy wist net wat er oars dwaan moast.
You hurt us.	Jo dogge ús sear.
She's fine now.	Se is no goed.
Just three of it.	Krekt trije fan it.
You do not have to come to school so early.	Jo hoege net sa betiid op skoalle te kommen.
But it has never been done before.	Mar it is noch noait earder dien.
I have not decided yet.	Ik haw my noch net besletten.
She could not do the money.	Se koe it jild net dwaan.
We do not want that to happen.	Dat wolle wy net barre.
Or maybe that's not it.	Of miskien is dat net it.
He was surprised.	Hy wie ferrast.
He would only have a few.	Hy soe mar in pear hawwe.
That had already happened.	Dat wie al bard.
There was no need for that.	Dêr wie neat fan nedich.
Well, that just will not do.	No, dat sil gewoan net dwaan.
I think about a lot of things.	Ik tink oer in protte dingen.
You will give many things away.	Jo sille jaan in protte dingen fuort.
I have to get out of town.	Ik moat de stêd út.
He did not like the idea that he had hurt her.	Hy mocht net fan it idee dat er har sear makke hie.
They can do whatever they want.	Se kinne alles dwaan wat se wolle.
So it had to happen.	Sa moast it barre.
It was good that he did not have.	It wie goed dat er net hie.
That's just not true.	Dat is gewoan net wier.
He liked it.	Hy like it.
I never regretted it.	Ik ha der noait spyt fan hân.
We should not either.	Wy moatte ek net.
But one day her mother could not return.	Mar op in dei koe har mem net werom.
You have to see it that way.	Jo moatte it sa sjen.
They could not be or otherwise.	Se koene net wêze of oars.
And it’s not just her.	En it is net allinnich har.
But please do not do it.	Mar doch it asjebleaft net.
But these were not the kind of people he could.	Mar dit wiene net it soarte minsken dat er koe.
Not quite sure what happened.	Net hielendal wis wat der bard is.
I think this is not good.	Ik tink dat dit net goed is.
Let me tell you a little more.	Lit my dy wat mear fertelle.
I wanted to make one there too.	Ik woe der ek ien meitsje.
She left with him an hour ago.	Se gie in oere lyn mei him fuort.
I wonder what will happen now.	Ik freegje my ôf wat der no barre sil.
He would be my words.	Hy soe myn wurden wêze.
Now she was here.	No wie se hjir.
You can bad.	Jo kinne min.
He had done that.	Dat hie er dien.
I'm not quite sure.	Ik bin der net hielendal wis fan.
If you are not happy, we are not happy.	As jo ​​net bliid binne, binne wy ​​net bliid.
But it is only under water.	Mar it is allinnich ûnder wetter.
Maybe they did something wrong.	Miskien hawwe se wat ferkeard dien.
This is where he came from.	Dit is wêr't hy kaam.
My friend told me that everything would be fine.	Myn freon fertelde my dat alles goed soe wêze.
Not once.	Net ien kear.
If it did not hurt you, it would not hurt me.	As it dy net dien hat, sil it my gjin sear dwaan.
She could not believe this was happening again.	Se koe net leauwe dat dit wer barde.
That will take care of him.	Dat sil foar him soargje.
He was probably at work.	Hy wie wierskynlik oan it wurk.
But it's like doing everything.	Mar it is as alles dwaan.
We have not really made it yet.	Wy hawwe it noch net echt makke.
Best place to buy.	Bêste plak om te keapjen.
Can't just go.	Kin net gewoan gean.
But his life was different now.	Mar syn libben wie no oars.
Then people do not want to play again.	Dan wolle minsken net wer spylje.
If you want to talk to us, fine.	As jo ​​​​mei ús prate wolle, goed.
Of course, she may have been wrong.	Fansels kin se ferkeard hawwe.
Well, let's go then.	No, litte wy dan gean.
Now we know they do.	No witte wy dat se dogge.
Well, let me put it another way.	No, lit my it oars sizze.
Of course, this will not be the last time.	Fansels sil dit net de lêste kear wêze.
I love what he does.	Ik hâld fan wat hy docht.
You get more work.	Jo krije mear wurk.
He could not.	Hy mocht net.
Get away from me.	Gean by my wei.
She thought what a good father he would be.	Se tocht wat in goede heit hy wêze soe.
But she knew that was not her only reason.	Mar se wist dat dat net har iennichste reden wie.
Need help.	Graach help nedich.
You will not make much money doing this.	Jo sille net meitsje folle jild dwaan dit.
Another man joined her.	In oare man kaam har by.
I do not feel so good today.	Ik fiel my hjoed net sa goed.
We knew there had to be a better way.	Wy wisten dat der in bettere manier wêze moast.
It was just so hard.	It wie krekt sa dreech.
She didn't even want to think about it.	Se woe it net iens tinke.
There is plenty to do.	Der is genôch te dwaan.
He was never our friend.	Hy wie nea ús freon.
For more money.	Foar mear jild.
We do not need help.	Wy hawwe gjin help nedich.
I went through that too.	Ik gie der ek troch.
Do not live and work in the same place.	Net wenje en wurkje op itselde plak.
This is happening, for now.	Dit bart, foar no.
Not that it would do us any good now.	Net dat it ús no goed dwaan soe.
Someone who wants me out of the way.	Immen dy't my út 'e wei wol.
I kept going.	Ik bleau troch.
He does not get out of bed.	Hy komt net fan bêd.
Very good it is too.	Hiel goed is it ek.
A lot is not good.	In protte is net goed.
It's just an idea of ​​mine.	It is mar in idee fan my.
Woman came home found him.	Frou kaam thús fûn him.
I'm not asking for it.	Ik freegje it net.
We just do not talk about it.	Wy prate der gewoan net oer.
I just wanted something.	Ik woe gewoan wat.
Tomorrow is my day.	Moarn is myn dei.
They say you need it, you say they can afford it.	Se sizze dat jo it nedich hawwe, jo sizze dat se it hâlde kinne.
What's more, it's not much fun.	Wat mear is, it is net folle leuk.
That she now knew with her whole being.	Dat wist se no mei har hiele wêzen.
It had been a person.	It hie in persoan west.
I want both.	Ik wol beide.
The one you can talk to.	De ien mei wa't jo prate kinne.
I'm surprised at how well it's going.	Ik bin ferrast hoe goed it giet.
I'm wrong then.	Ik bin dan ferkeard.
He knew it was coming.	Hy wist dat it kommen soe.
Who 'we' were.	Wa 'wy' wiene.
But there is also something else.	Mar der is ek wat oars.
Where we are.	Wêr't wy binne.
I found out my problem.	Ik fûn út myn probleem.
They often talk to me about him.	Se prate faak mei my oer him.
They never have.	Se hawwe noait.
This is a first.	Dizze is in earste.
I had to be careful.	Ik moast foarsichtich wêze.
I had to take the job.	Ik moast de baan nimme.
The friends you had are still your friends.	De freonen dy't jo hiene binne noch altyd jo freonen.
And you will not know it.	En jo sille it net witte.
And look at him now.	En sjoch him no.
The tour was ready.	De tocht wie klear.
I did not tell her that day or any other day.	Ik fertelde har net dy dei of in oare dei.
This was the good thing.	Dit wie it goede.
Where will they take him.	Wêr sille se him nimme.
Really nice book.	Echt moai boek.
I have always been beautiful.	Ik bin altyd moai west.
You will be a father to their children.	Jo sille heit wêze foar har bern.
Think about it this way.	Tink der sa oer.
You know better than that.	Jo witte better as dat.
She would leave it for now.	Se soe it foar no litte.
I want to keep my job.	Ik wol myn baan hâlde.
They ask me things, they tell me things.	Se freegje my dingen, se fertelle my dingen.
Do not work like this here.	Wurkje hjir net sa.
We will take care of everything else.	Wy sille soargje foar al it oare.
We become more than it is.	Wy wurde mear as it.
He took them home.	Hy naam se mei nei hûs.
I really like to go.	Ik hâld echt fan om te gean.
It did not.	It hie net.
I do not know who had the first, really.	Ik wit net wa't de earste hie, echt.
This is obviously not true.	Dit is fansels net wier.
I had to think.	Ik moast tinke.
You also do not want to go.	Jo wolle ek net gean.
But these things he comes up with.	Mar dizze dingen komt er mei út.
In that room.	Yn dy keamer.
She looked up at him.	Se seach nei him op.
I'm days in and out.	Ik bin dagen yn en út.
But they are not here.	Mar se binne hjir net.
We go together.	Wy geane tegearre.
In fact, they are afraid of it.	Eins binne se der bang foar.
There was one child, a boy.	Der wie ien bern, in jonge.
She left without a word.	Se gie sûnder in wurd fuort.
Both children love this book.	Beide bern hâlde fan dit boek.
You show them.	Jo litte har sjen.
He did not hesitate.	Hy hoegde net.
He would not know where she was.	Hy soe net witte wêr't se wie.
This is your time.	Dit is dyn tiid.
He had no idea who it was.	Hy hie gjin idee wa't it wie.
I do not know how, but it went with the money.	Ik wit net hoe, mar it gie mei it jild.
He also dismissed them.	Hy die se ek ôf.
We are now a family.	Wy binne no in famylje.
I had lived here.	Ik hie hjir wenne.
You have to see it for yourself.	Jo moatte it sels sjen.
It's not good.	It is net goed.
We can not agree.	Wy kinne it net iens wurde.
They want to talk about being nice.	Se wolle prate oer aardich wêze.
But he can say a few things about it.	Mar hy kin der in pear dingen oer sizze.
Please.	Asjebleaft.
And then home.	En dan nei hûs.
I would be happy.	Ik soe bliid wêze.
It seems like.	It liket as.
There is no more food.	Der is gjin iten mear.
She took my hand in hers.	Se naam myn hân yn har.
It was there alone.	It wie dêr allinnich.
It was different.	It wie oars.
I'm still not sure what to make of it.	Ik bin noch net wis wat ik der fan meitsje moat.
I hit it off.	Ik rekke it.
I could .	Ik soe kinne .
She was not allowed to do this.	Se mocht dit net dwaan.
We should try to talk to her.	Wy moatte besykje mei har te praten.
Everything went well.	Alles gie goed.
Not so.	Net wat sa.
You do well to love them.	Jo dogge it goed om fan har te hâlden.
I love that thing.	Ik hâld fan dat ding.
He did that to help his mother.	Hy die dat om syn mem te helpen.
Also, you do not have to worry about me.	Ek moatte jo gjin soargen meitsje oer my.
And it could help.	En it koe helpe.
Come on, everyone.	Kom op, elkenien.
Get there now.	Kom der no hinne.
He had seen what he was not supposed to see.	Hy hie sjoen wat er net sjen moast.
I found it easy to read.	Ik fûn it maklik om te lêzen.
I'll have to do it myself.	Ik sil it sels dwaan moatte.
This is your last chance!	Dit is dyn lêste kâns!
Think about doing it.	Tink oer it dwaan.
Here is our house.	Hjir is ús hûs.
He came back for her.	Hy kaam werom foar har.
I found him.	Ik fûn him.
We love him.	Wy hâlde fan him.
He would never be complete.	Hy soe nea hielendal wêze.
You know nothing about him.	Jo witte neat oer him.
I got angry.	Ik waard lilk.
And not doing well in a new way.	En net goed dwaan op in nije manier.
Tomorrow is not your time of day, not so early.	Moarn is net jo tiid fan 'e dei, net sa betiid.
I could never do that.	Dat koe ik noait dwaan.
That's where I'm right.	Dêr bin ik krekt.
Not in a nothing.	Net yn in neat.
You look like her.	Jo lykje op har.
Must be that year.	Moete dat jier.
Many people believe that children should be seen and not heard.	In protte minsken leauwe dat bern sjoen en net heard wurde moatte.
Let me know.	Lit my mar.
You have to get it, get it, get it!	Jo moatte it krije, krije it, krije it!
You can not see it.	Jo kinne it net sjen.
You can get them at the door.	Jo kinne se by de doar krije.
He seems very sure.	Hy liket hiel wis.
And it must.	En it moat.
You will find me.	Jo sille my fine.
We'll take him.	Wy sille him nimme.
I made it.	Ik haw it makke.
But it can be a bad thing.	Mar it kin in min ding wêze.
I can really talk to you.	Ik kin echt mei dy prate.
Do it fast.	Doch it gau.
Well, not anymore.	No, net mear.
We have no water.	Wy hawwe gjin wetter.
And it was easy to do.	En it wie maklik te dwaan.
We've talking about it.	Wy prate der oer.
That first.	Dat earst.
I'll get them ready.	Ik sil se klear meitsje.
There's probably a reason for that.	Der is wierskynlik in reden foar.
She was never mine.	Se wie nea fan my.
We will not stop there.	Dêr sille wy net mei ophâlde.
I can handle this, it's just a job.	Ik kin dit wol oan, it is mar in baan.
What else do I have to do here.	Wat moat ik hjir noch dwaan.
They had done it together.	Se hiene it tegearre dien.
She could not stand it.	Se koe it net oan.
Do not like it.	Hâld der net fan.
No man had ever done that to me before in my life.	Gjin man hie ea dien dat oan my foar yn myn libben.
But there's one more thing before you go.	Mar d'r is noch ien ding foardat jo gean.
In a way, that's exactly what it is.	Op in manier is dat krekt wat dit is.
They are still working.	Se wurkje noch.
It's good to talk to your mom.	It is goed om mei dyn mem te praten.
He wants your family.	Hy wol dyn famylje.
I'll be watching a movie.	Ik sil in film sjen.
I just thought it would be good to see you.	Ik tocht gewoan dat it goed wêze soe om dy te sjen.
Everyone had told her.	Elkenien hie it har ferteld.
We could know it.	Wy koene it witte.
He obviously could not.	Hy koe fansels net.
That was all different now.	Dat wie no allegear oars.
She needs a car.	Se moat in auto.
Do you even have money to give him we want to ask.	Hawwe jo sels jild om him te jaan wolle wy freegje.
They were the same kind of thing.	Se wiene itselde soarte fan ding.
We have other things to do.	Wy hawwe oare dingen te dwaan.
And you do it, over and over and over.	En jo dogge it, oer en oer en oer.
It will take people.	It sil minsken nimme.
I love reading what you have to say.	Ik hâld fan lêzen wat jo te sizzen hawwe.
Keep it for the people.	Hâld it foar de minsken.
What is your favorite book?	Wat is dyn favorite boek?
It was the dog that came and told us.	It wie de hûn dy't kaam en fertelde ús.
I would not try it.	Ik soe it net besykje.
He really could not.	Dat koe er eins net.
I worked it out.	Ik haw it wurke.
If only he had told her.	As er it har mar ferteld hie.
It's for everyone.	It is foar elkenien.
He liked to talk to her, the boy liked.	Hy mocht graach mei har prate, like de jonge.
No one heard him.	Nimmen hearde him.
I could see why.	Ik koe sjen wêrom.
Now it needed a new name.	No hie it in nije namme nedich.
For whatever reason, this put him off.	Om hokker reden dan ek, dit sette him ôf.
I love everything about him.	Ik hâld fan alles oer him.
That's right.	Sa is er krekt.
Her last thoughts were of her family.	Har lêste gedachten wiene fan har famylje.
Earlier that day, she had been to the movie.	Earder dy dei wie se nei de film west.
Everything seemed to be easy.	Alles like maklik te wêzen.
It's not enough.	It is net genôch.
A few people are all in one way or another.	In pear minsken binne allegear op ien of oare manier.
It just looks like you.	It liket krekt op dy.
I know it's late.	Ik wit dat it let is.
We were for those things.	Wy wiene foar dy dingen.
Make up for the problems she had with her.	Meitsje de problemen dy't se mei har hie.
He thought so too.	Dat tocht er ek.
I can not help them.	Ik kin se net helpe.
It's been a year or so without any problems.	It is al in jier as wat sûnder problemen.
This comes from good reading.	Dit komt fan goed lêzen.
He's gone now.	Hy is no fuort.
If there was nothing, there was everything to do.	As der neat wie, wie der alles te meitsjen.
This is just wrong.	Dit is krekt ferkeard.
She did not want her husband to know.	Se woe net dat har man it wist.
They had one man there and only one man.	Se hiene dêr ien man en mar ien man.
It didn’t even seem real.	It like net iens echt.
I see him play a bit.	Ik sjoch him in bytsje spylje.
I went for it.	Ik gie derop.
I can not ask for more.	Ik kin net freegje om mear.
Of course, one had.	Fansels, ien hie.
Let's hope it's good!	Litte wy hoopje dat it goed komt!
Exactly where they can go.	Krekt wêr't se hinne kinne.
You have to see them.	Jo moatte se sjen.
I want it to work well.	Ik wol dat it goed wurket.
Come on, take a good look.	Kom op, sjoch goed.
Opened his door.	Die syn doar iepen.
Believe me, you would love it there.	Leau my, jo soene it leuk fine dêr.
They bought a car, but it was not good.	Se hawwe in auto kocht, mar dy hat net goed west.
But be careful what you want.	Mar wês foarsichtich wat jo wolle.
That was done with good reason.	Dat waard mei goede reden dien.
It will be pretty hard.	It sil moai hurd wêze.
Water was provided as needed.	Wetter waard jûn as nedich.
It was true.	It wie wier.
Maybe you should try this one of these days.	Miskien moatte jo dit ien fan dizze dagen besykje.
Your wife needs to be here soon.	Dyn frou moat hjir gau wêze.
She walked away without saying another word.	Se gie fuort sûnder noch in wurd te sizzen.
They are people too.	It binne ek minsken.
You do not have to go in there.	Jo hoege der net yn te gean.
You know exactly what to do.	Jo witte krekt wat te dwaan.
I would like to think that this did not actually happen.	Ik soe tinke wolle dat dat eins net bard is.
That could not be her mother.	Dat koe har mem net wêze.
I do not know what's going on.	Ik wit net wat der bart.
He can win nothing like that.	Hy kin sa neat winne.
A boy and his father.	In jonge en syn heit.
No matter how bad people are, wait before you speak.	Hoe min minsken ek binne, wachtsje foardat jo prate.
There are a lot of people.	Der binne in protte minsken.
Do so much more with one car.	Doch safolle mear mei ien auto.
One, two, many.	Ien, twa, in protte.
It was both.	It wie beide.
You did nothing wrong.	Jo hawwe neat ferkeard dien.
People need to get away.	Minsken moatte fuort.
This house is very old.	Dit hûs is heul âld.
No one is around.	Gjinien is om.
There is so much more than just driving.	D'r is safolle mear dan gewoan riden.
I believe my time has come.	Ik leau dat myn tiid kommen is.
She's not coming back to town.	Se komt net werom nei de stêd.
There was something in it.	Der siet wat yn.
There are still too many.	Der binne noch te folle.
There was no way to help her.	Der wie gjin manier om har te helpen.
And so they knew the girl was in that room.	En sa wisten se dat it famke yn dy keamer wie.
I still had a job to do.	Ik hie noch in baan te dwaan.
That the se.	Dat die se.
She just looked at him.	Se seach him mar oan.
We need her at home.	Wy hawwe har thús nedich.
They were nothing to me.	Se wiene neat foar my.
Everyone knows it.	Elkenien wit it.
That's really not true.	Dat is echt net wier.
Now it seemed he had to do just that.	No like it derop dat er dat krekt dwaan moast.
I think she knew it well.	Ik tink dat se it wol wist.
It was obviously not for me.	It wie fansels net foar my.
There was never enough money.	Der wie noait genôch jild.
Then two more.	Dan noch twa.
They eat me from home and home.	Se ite my út hûs en thús.
Try not to show me anything.	Besykje my neat te sjen.
I have to go back home.	Ik moat werom nei hûs.
It's not that it has to happen.	It is net dat it moat barre.
You can live in my house.	Jo kinne yn myn hûs wenje.
We can buy.	Wy kinne keapje.
He was glad she did it that way.	Hy wie bliid dat se it sa die.
I can tell you what she thinks.	Ik kin fertelle wat se tinkt.
The young woman made herself ready to leave.	De jonge frou makke har klear om fuort te gean.
I've been waiting for thirty years.	Ik wachte al tritich jier.
It's your life you do not get.	It is dyn libben dat jo net krije.
And there you go.	En dêr geane jo foar.
I knew exactly what to do.	Ik wist krekt wat te dwaan.
It's the problem.	It is it probleem.
We ask about your life.	Wy freegje oer dyn libben.
That he would know.	Dat soe er witte.
I have a house now.	Ik haw no in hûs.
Not everyone can.	Net elkenien kin.
I do not want him to leave.	Ik wol net dat er fuort giet.
You go where it wants to go.	Jo geane wêr't it hinne wol.
That whole we humans thing.	Dat hiele wy de minsken ding.
I'll tell you exactly the same thing.	Ik sil jo krekt itselde ding fertelle.
This could not happen.	Dit koe net barre.
It was obviously different.	It wie fansels oars.
And we will have help.	En wy sille help hawwe.
They would be wrong.	Se soene ferkeard wêze.
One that was not good.	Ien dy't net goed wie.
She does a great job of showing you how to do it.	Se docht in goede baan om jo te sjen hoe't jo it moatte dwaan.
He was never sick.	Hy wie nea siik.
It was my job.	It wie myn wurk.
These are people.	Dit binne minsken.
I think I could get into this.	Ik tink dat ik koe krije yn dit.
It hurts them both.	It docht se beide sear.
It's been a long time since he saw it.	It is lang lyn dat er it sjoen hat.
She has always been really good to me.	Se hat altyd echt goed foar my west.
This whole thing.	Dit hiele ding.
We'll be able to see it.	Wy sille it sjen kinne.
Think about it now.	Tink der no oer.
But not in there.	Mar dêr net yn.
This time you are ready.	Dizze kear binne jo klear.
If you can talk about it.	As jo ​​der oer prate kinne.
But they are wrong to assume this.	Mar se binne ferkeard om dit oan te nimmen.
It would be the first time, if it did.	It soe de earste kear wêze, as it die.
Be careful of the dog.	Wês foarsichtich foar de hûn.
But there is still time.	Mar der is noch tiid.
I want to see more.	Ik wol wol mear sjen.
Many people have this problem.	In protte minsken hawwe dit probleem.
She looked long.	Se seach lang.
It felt just like a movie.	It fielde krekt as in film.
I can not tell everything exactly what it does.	Ik kin net alles krekt fertelle wat it docht.
She will not be back for a few days.	Se komt in pear dagen net werom.
You needed me.	Do hiest my nedich.
I have said the same thing here.	Ik haw hjir itselde sein.
She does not like help.	Se hâldt net fan help.
We have to be very careful.	Wy moatte tige foarsichtich wêze.
Not even a bit.	Net iens in bytsje.
I'm a woman.	Ik bin in frou.
I had never seen the room before.	Ik hie de keamer noch noait earder sjoen.
If you get a chance, of course.	As jo ​​in kâns krije, fansels.
A careful plan was made.	Der waard in foarsichtich plan makke.
We only had one car.	Wy hiene mar ien auto.
She never even asked his name.	Se frege sels noait syn namme.
But let me be clear.	Mar lit my dúdlik wêze.
And they were angry too.	En se wiene ek lilk.
We want to do it all.	Wy wolle it allegear dwaan.
I'm not feeling well today.	Ik fiel my hjoed net goed.
The last letter came about a week ago.	De lêste brief kaam sa'n wike lyn.
Well, this is it.	No, dit is it.
It never happens.	It bart noait.
Nobody really does it.	Nimmen docht it echt.
In fact, he felt absolutely nothing.	Eins fielde er hielendal neat.
The truth is, not one of us knows it yet exactly.	De wierheid is, net ien fan ús wit it noch krekt.
It did me good.	It die my goed.
But it was too late now.	Mar it wie no te let.
Look out!	Sjoch út!
I also do not know about me.	Ik wit ek net oer my.
She was surprised at how easy it was.	Se wie ferrast oer hoe maklik it wie.
There is no one else.	Der is gjinien mear.
They were still family.	Se wiene noch famylje.
It was a good job.	It wie in goed wurk.
Everything works fine.	Alles wurket goed.
You should if she did not.	Jo soene moatte as se net die.
How they make your things.	Hoe't se jo dingen meitsje.
It did nothing.	It die neat.
And everything went well.	En alles gie goed.
Then it becomes what we do.	Dan wurdt it dat wat wy dogge.
Give a little to get a lot.	Jou in bytsje om in protte te krijen.
I should not do this.	Ik soe dit net dwaan moatte.
He never got them.	Hy krige se noait.
I did not like your work and took the opportunity to quit.	Ik haw jo wurk net leuk en naam de kâns om op te hâlden.
He looked at her as if she were eating.	Hy seach har oan as wie se iten.
The day he came home.	De dei dat er thús kaam.
It's early.	It is betiid.
We are good enough, good enough good enough.	Wy binne goed genôch, genôch goed genôch.
Leave it to the police.	Lit it oan de plysje oer.
That's a job.	Dat is in baan.
The time has come.	De tiid is kaam.
They want it.	Se winskje it.
Is a party.	Is in feest.
He had done it before.	Hy hie it earder dien.
We do not know his name.	Wy witte syn namme net.
She comes from a large family.	Se komt út in grutte famylje.
If you have one, take it off.	As jo ​​ien hawwe, nim dan ôf.
She leaves no word.	Se lit gjin wurd.
I will say the same to him.	Dat sil ik ek foar him sizze.
I had to leave.	Ik moast fuort.
Just like yesterday.	Krekt as juster.
There was no food.	Der wie gjin iten.
He quickly looked away.	Hy seach gau fuort.
You should be too.	Jo moatte ek wêze.
But there's another reason we should go there.	Mar d'r is in oare reden dat wy der hinne moatte.
That worked for me.	Dat wurke foar my.
It's good, you do not need one.	It is goed, jo hawwe net ien nedich.
It would be best if you were.	It soe it bêste wêze as jo it wiene.
I think we are too.	Ik tink dat wy ek binne.
I think he.	Ik tink hy.
It will come in handy.	It sil goed komme.
Hope to see you there.	Hoopje dy dêr te sjen.
I could see that all day, all week.	Dat koe ik de hiele dei, de hiele wike sjen.
Well, not for you.	No, net foar dy.
He let the woman go.	Hy liet de frou wol gean.
See before it's too late.	Sjoch foardat it te let is.
Just what was needed.	Krekt wat nedich wie.
Much more actually.	In protte mear eins.
That is what she must say to him.	Dat moat se tsjin him sizze.
There's a reason why we're still here.	Der is in reden wêrom't wy hjir noch binne.
I see or talk to no one.	Ik sjoch of praat mei gjinien.
I'm not sure why that is, but it just is.	Ik bin net wis wêrom dat is, mar it is gewoan.
I have been trying this for the last few hours.	Ik haw dit de lêste oeren besocht.
One thing was for sure.	Ien ding wie wis.
That's if you want my help.	Dat is as jo myn help wolle.
They were his.	Se wiene syn.
When you enter.	As jo ​​yn.
I looked around the room.	Ik seach om 'e keamer hinne.
I did not.	Ik hie net.
They come back and they work.	Se komme werom en se wurkje.
I am sorry	It spyt my
I might have done something different.	Ik hie miskien wat oars dien.
And you can not do that if you do not know who the person is.	En jo kinne dat net dwaan as jo net witte wa't de persoan is.
If there were none of you, they would not need any of you.	As d'r gjinien fan jo wiene, soene se net ien fan jo nedich hawwe.
Try it out, please.	Besykje it út, asjebleaft.
Be real.	Wês echt.
We do the best we can.	Wy dogge it bêste dat wy kinne.
We could not get in there.	Wy koene der net yn.
Nobody loves him.	Nimmen hâldt fan him.
I want another chance.	Ik wol in oare kâns.
No one could believe it.	Nimmen koe it leauwe.
I am very good to people who are good to me.	Ik bin heul goed foar minsken dy't goed foar my binne.
I just said it.	Ik sei it krekt.
It was his house.	It wie syn hûs.
Either way can work.	Beide manier kin wurkje.
He could see no way.	Hy koe gjin wei sjen.
I just found it.	Ik haw it krekt fûn.
They are beautiful	Se binne moai
There are none.	Der binne gjinien.
I have a lot and good.	Ik haw in protte en goede.
Then, the other.	Dan, de oare.
Well, maybe it did, but this time not.	No, miskien die it, mar dizze kear net.
That would not happen.	Dat soe net barre.
He will wake up tomorrow.	Hy sil moarn wekker wurde.
There was nothing to buy.	Der wie neat te keapjen.
So were other people out of the house.	Sa wiene oare minsken út it hûs.
They had none.	Se hiene gjinien.
He does not like that.	Dat hâldt er net fan.
It was not gone.	It wie net fuort.
I see what they did there.	Ik sjoch wat se dêr dien hawwe.
I can not see you like that.	Ik kin dy net sa sjen.
Or as good as.	Of sa goed as.
He was so tired.	Hy wie sa wurch.
There's that word again.	Dêr is dat wurd wer.
They were very beautiful.	Se wiene hiel moai.
They got it.	Se krigen it.
All you have to do is agree with me, now.	Alles wat jo hoege te dwaan is mei my iens, no.
I live where the money goes.	Ik wenne wêr't it jild giet.
I have to get out of the water.	Ik moat út it wetter.
We can not do this.	Dit kinne wy ​​net dwaan.
Want to see how it's done?	Wolle jo sjen hoe't it dien wurdt?.
It's so good.	It is sa goed.
I'm glad you're around.	Ik bin bliid datst bist om.
He came home.	Hy kaam thús.
So they said.	Sa seine se.
You will find a lot of new people there.	Jo sille dêr in protte nije minsken fine.
Now you are not.	No do bist net.
I still remember what it was like.	Ik wit noch hoe't it wie.
It just wasn't good.	It wie gewoan net goed.
She does not read much.	Se docht net folle lêzen.
I doubt it will be easy.	Ik twifelje dat it maklik wêze sil.
This woman had hurt someone she could.	Dizze frou hie immen sear dien dy't se koe.
It was one of the best days of his life.	It wie ien fan de bêste dagen fan syn libben.
He's been here all weekend.	Hy hat hjir it hiele wykein west.
He would get through that.	Hy soe dat troch krije.
We work it out.	Wy wurkje it.
It's not very good.	It is net hiel goed.
It's just.	It is gewoan.
It had not turned out well.	It wie net goed wurden.
One that was good.	Ien dy't goed wie.
I would be happy to see him back.	Ik soe bliid wêze om him werom te sjen.
She seemed surprised.	Se like ferrast.
It did not come out of nowhere.	It kaam net út it neat.
She had seen him before.	Se hie him earder sjoen.
He worked for us of course, so sure he could help.	Hy wurke foar ús fansels, sa wis koe er helpe.
They take one hour.	Se nimme ien oere.
He who loves his wife loves himself.	Wa't fan syn frou hâldt, hâldt fan himsels.
He did not ask.	Hy frege net.
My hair is really long.	Myn hier is echt lang.
I had been there.	Ik hie der west.
But now we are not trying to figure anything out.	Mar no besykje wy neat út te finen.
This is my last chance.	Dit is myn lêste kâns.
I'm up to it now, she thought.	Ik bin der no mei oan, tocht se.
Time went by.	De tiid gie troch.
Tell people what you did.	Fertel minsken wat jo dien hawwe.
It is clear that people find it a good idea.	It is dúdlik dat minsken it in goed idee fine.
I just walked away.	Ik rûn krekt fuort.
You have a year.	Jo hawwe in jier.
This is for me.	Dizze is foar my.
But we must not stop there.	Mar dêr moatte wy net ophâlde.
I thought it was you.	Ik tocht dat it dy wie.
That was good to see.	Dat wie goed om te sjen.
She was too scared.	Se wie te bang.
I hope you are doing well.	Ik hoopje dat it goed mei jo giet.
Time to leave.	Tiid om fuort te gean.
I now know what he thinks.	Ik wit no wat er tinkt.
Let me tell you my way.	Lit my it op myn manier fertelle.
Give me the book back.	Jou my it boek werom.
I looked again.	Ik seach wer.
We think it can somehow.	Wy tinke dat it ien of oare manier kin.
Maybe it has something to do with this.	Miskien hat it hjir wat mei te krijen.
People know that.	Minsken witte dat.
He was a man of bad words.	Hy wie in man fan min wurden.
But he knew.	Mar hy wist.
My next may or may not.	Myn folgjende kin of miskien net.
He needs a good house.	Hy hat in goed hûs nedich.
She did not know what to believe.	Se wist net wat se leauwe moast.
Where they could do this forever.	Wêr't se dit foar altyd dwaan koene.
Last year, they put three out.	Ferline jier sette se trije út.
After this meeting.	Nei dizze gearkomste.
Your father is very ill.	Jo heit is tige siik.
We are not ready yet.	Wy binne noch net klear.
And you have to be.	En jo moatte wêze.
I've never met her before.	Ik haw har noch noait moete.
These are the children.	Dit binne de bern.
I was so sure of it.	Ik wie der sa wis fan.
It will be me and my girl.	It sil my en myn famke wêze.
I think you will too.	Ik tink dat jo ek sille.
It had run so well.	It hie sa goed rûn.
It will be beautiful.	It sil moai wurde.
I should be.	Ik soe wêze moatte.
I thought this worked, a lot of people did not.	Ik tocht dat dit wurke, in protte minsken net.
It took it out of me.	It naam it út my.
Let me know if they were fun.	Lit my witte oft se wiene leuk.
At school it had been like that.	Op skoalle hie it sa west.
I can not agree with her here.	Ik kin it hjir net mei har iens wêze.
There is not enough money.	Der is net genôch jild.
They did, probably often.	Se diene, wierskynlik faak.
You are not what they are.	Jo binne net wat se binne.
Still alive and all.	Noch yn libben en alles.
Be good now.	Wês no goed.
It's not my problem.	It is net myn probleem.
It's a nice house.	It is in moai hûs.
It did nothing.	It die neat.
It's not there, but it's there.	It is der net, mar it is der.
I did not expect that to happen.	Ik hie net ferwachte dat dat soe barre.
I felt a little out of place.	Ik fielde my in bytsje út syn plak.
But today is different.	Mar hjoed is oars.
They were not wrong in that.	Dêr wiene se net ferkeard yn.
You know you want to.	Jo witte dat jo wolle.
We're ready for you.	Wy binne klear as jo binne.
I do not even want to do it.	Ik wol it net iens dwaan.
Many many.	In protte in protte.
A few they had met.	In pear hiene se moete.
Do not do that.	Doch dat net.
So you have to eat them already the first day.	Sa moatte jo se al de earste dei ite.
You do not have to be angry.	Jo hoege net lilk te wêzen.
It has never been well attended.	It is nea goed besocht.
I wanted to eat them.	Ik woe se ite.
We can go home.	Wy kinne nei hûs.
If not, he can not make it to tomorrow.	As net, dan kin hy it net oant moarn meitsje.
I'm not so sure.	Ik bin der net sa wis fan.
It was not the same.	It wie net itselde.
They would not, of course.	Se soene net, fansels.
I knew this could happen.	Ik wist dat dit barre koe.
I look forward to the city.	Ik sjoch út nei de stêd.
We are someone.	Wy binne immen.
But that's me.	Mar dat bin ik.
She wondered if he felt the same way.	Se frege har ôf oft er itselde fielde.
Never give up.	Jou nea op.
But we need to know.	Mar wy moatte it witte.
We never had one.	Wy hiene noait ien.
And father.	En heit.
Until you are ready to do something about it.	Oant jo klear binne om der wat oan te dwaan.
But that's not how it works.	Mar sa wurket it net.
She is only interested in money.	Se is allinnich ynteressearre yn jild.
I have to say she's pretty tall.	Ik moat sizze dat se frij lang is.
This is what you will be, what will happen to you.	Dit is wat jo sille wêze, wat sil jo barre.
The room was easy.	De keamer wie maklik.
It was so different.	It wie sa oars.
I think we had enough.	Ik tink dat wy genôch hiene.
I've never felt this way before.	Ik fielde my noch noait sa.
I knew it was done.	Ik wist it dien.
We have been together for three years.	Wy binne trije jier tegearre.
It seemed like he was.	It like dat er wie.
But it seemed good, in a way.	Mar it like goed, op in manier.
If you find him, let me know.	As jo ​​fine him, lit my witte.
And this is true.	En dit is wier.
Please let it go.	Lit it mar asjebleaft gean.
Looks very nice.	Sjocht der hiel moai út.
But that's not what we're talking about here.	Mar dêr dogge wy ús hjir net oer.
I need to know how this happened.	Ik moat witte hoe't dit barde.
And that just does not work.	En dat giet gewoan net.
But one met.	Mar ien moete.
Money, for one thing.	Jild, foar ien ding.
She asked him if he would let her live there.	Se frege har ôf oft er har dêr wenje litte soe.
And she could not think of it tomorrow either.	En se koe der moarn ek net oan tinke.
The person would just be gone.	De persoan soe gewoan fuort wêze.
He worked on them.	Hy wurke oan har.
We have it under us.	Wy hawwe it ûnder ús.
That's what she got from you.	Dat hat se fan dy krigen.
I hope you are fine with that.	Ik hoopje dat jo der goed mei binne.
She was old, but she was beautiful.	Se wie âld, mar se wie moai.
Maybe you should stop now.	Miskien moatte jo no ophâlde.
The kids love him.	De bern hâlde fan him.
Maybe he's getting too old for this.	Miskien wurdt er hjir te âld foar.
One, not much.	Ien, net folle.
I want to show this in my house.	Ik wol dit yn myn hûs sjen litte.
He knows he could do it.	Hy wit dat er it koe.
I had no plan.	Ik hie gjin plan.
He told me to say that.	Hy fertelde my om dat te sizzen.
It's getting hard.	It wurdt hurd.
Hope to get one of these soon.	Hoopje ien fan dizze gau te krijen.
If it did, it would probably be done wrong.	As it die, soe it wierskynlik ferkeard dien wurde.
That was what happened.	Dat wie wat bard.
You need to make sure you have everything.	Jo moatte der wis fan wêze dat jo alles hawwe.
He had this.	Hy hie dit.
He comes as one.	Hy komt as ien.
Same with my friends.	Itselde mei myn freonen.
We want what we do not have.	Wy wolle wat wy net hawwe.
It is the food we eat.	It is it iten dat wy ite.
You have to work hard.	Jo moatte hurd wurkje.
He did not look around happily.	Hy seach der net bliid om.
One of us needs to talk!	Ien fan ús moat prate!
He the May.	Hy die mei.
I really had no idea.	Ik hie der echt gjin idee fan.
He felt bad for her.	Hy fielde him min foar har.
This is the last one.	Dit is de lêste.
And it's not enough yet.	En it is noch net genôch.
He better wait.	Hy soe better wachtsje.
You may or may not have heard of it by now.	Jo kinne al of net hawwe heard no.
It came to nothing.	It kaam ta neat.
Now the problem seems to be gone.	No liket it probleem fuort te wêzen.
But, please, do not tell anyone.	Mar, asjebleaft, fertel it net oan ien.
Please do not come to me.	Kom asjebleaft net nei my ta.
I'm having a really hard time with that kind of thing.	Ik haw it echt dreech mei dat soarte dingen.
We need to talk to them.	Wy moatte mei har prate.
She wanted to give without taking.	Se woe jaan sûnder nimme.
That's not something.	Dat is net wat.
We can not stay.	Wy kinne net bliuwe.
He was on.	Hy wie oan.
Do not give up, not so.	Jou net op, net sa.
This time it's easy.	Dizze kear is it maklik.
I'm probably wrong.	Ik bin wierskynlik ferkeard.
Someone needs to have a word.	Immen moat in wurd hawwe.
There were almost two.	It wiene hast twa.
I've been thinking about you for a long, long time.	Ik haw al lang, lang oan dy tocht.
She has never had a boyfriend.	Se hat nea hie in freon.
I think you'll be fine.	Ik tink dat jo goed komme.
I had to be ready.	Ik moast klear wêze.
You do everything you have to.	Jo dogge alles wat jo moatte dwaan.
You never did that.	Dat hawwe jo noait dien.
I love his work.	Ik hâld fan syn wurk.
For one thing, there is now work going on three times a week.	Foar ien ding komt der no trije kear yn 'e wike wurk foar.
So little of everything these days.	Sa'n bytsje fan alles dizze dagen.
He was with a friend.	Hy wie by in freon.
I can not agree.	Ik kin it net iens wêze.
They want to make things happen.	Se wolle dingen meitsje.
Can't really do that now.	Kin dat no eins net dwaan.
They do not like you.	Se hâlde net fan dy.
But they have worked.	Mar se hawwe wurke.
You have to go back.	Jo moatte werom.
But she had nothing to do with it.	Mar se hie der neat oan.
But it did not have to be.	Mar it hoegde net te wêzen.
Think about it very carefully.	Tink der hiel foarsichtich oer.
I tried to be nice.	Ik besocht aardich te wêzen.
They are children.	It binne bern.
I did it.	Ik haw it dien.
That's what they did.	Dat diene se.
We do not believe this.	Wy leauwe dit net.
Time is hard.	Tiid is dreech.
Gau.	Gau.
So it would be.	Sa soe it wêze.
I did not think very clearly.	Ik tocht net echt dúdlik.
But that would be wrong.	Mar dat soe ferkeard wêze.
But the question is there.	Mar de fraach is der.
How long do we have to wait!	Hoe lang moatte wy noch wachtsje!
Nobody needs to know.	Nimmen moat it witte.
Hope to see you then !.	Hoopje dy dan te sjen!.
And it is we.	En it binne wy.
We are friends too.	Wy binne ek freonen.
Maybe that would be best.	Miskien soe dat it bêste wêze.
It does not.	It docht it net.
One man was killed.	Ien man kaam om it libben.
I tried not to be too late.	Ik besocht net te let te wêzen.
I bought a car.	Ik kocht in auto.
She would make it right.	Se soe it goed meitsje.
Without it he would have nothing.	Sûnder soe er neat hawwe.
I come from one.	Ik kom fan ien.
Try to do that.	Besykje dat te dwaan.
He really did.	Hy die it echt.
Or wait.	Of wachtsje.
A lot of it.	In protte fan it.
This is one of you.	Dit is ien fan dy.
There's a reason he's going to her.	Der is in reden dat er nei har giet.
But, that never happened.	Mar, dat is noait bard.
Be someone better.	Wês immen better.
We do not eat from it anymore.	Wy ite der net mear fan.
Could be his mother's house.	Kin it hûs fan syn mem wêze.
I really wanted to.	Ik woe echt wol.
she asked.	frege se har ôf.
I'm hit.	Ik bin rekke.
You know what's there.	Jo witte wat der is.
He always came back.	Hy kaam altyd werom.
He obviously does not know.	Hy wit it fansels net.
Go on about your life.	Gean troch oer dyn libben.
And then it's time for us to go.	En dan is it tiid foar ús om te gean.
I never looked back.	Ik seach noait werom.
He did so at dinner.	Dat die er by it iten.
I would say you do not need it.	Ik soe sizze dat jo it net nedich hawwe.
I do not want any more children.	Ik wol gjin bern mear.
She now had friends.	Se hie no freonen.
You said the good things.	Jo hawwe de goede dingen sein.
Love her love her love love her.	Hâld fan har hâld fan har hâld fan har.
No one for him.	Nimmen foar him.
You will see a few words.	Jo sille in pear wurden sjen.
And this stops.	En dit hâldt op.
I do not think anyone can.	Ik tink net dat ien kin.
He works hard and does a good job.	Hy wurket hurd en docht goed wurk.
There is no good reason for that.	Der is gjin goede reden foar.
That's what we're really for.	Dêr binne wy ​​hjir echt foar.
They will never have to go back.	Se sille nea moatte werom.
You have questions and you need help.	Jo hawwe fragen en jo hawwe help nedich.
I will do well.	Ik sil it goede dwaan.
And even if there is, see it my way.	En sels as d'r is, sjoch it op myn manier.
But nothing had happened.	Mar der wie neat bard.
Everyone could see it now, and knew she was a woman.	Elkenien koe it no sjen, en wist dat se in frou wie.
It hurts me a little.	It docht my wat.
But one thing for us to do.	Mar ien ding foar ús te dwaan.
He really did everything he could.	Hy die echt alles wat er koe.
He saw that now.	Dat seach er no.
Go to the meeting today.	Gean hjoed nei de gearkomste.
It will take more work.	It sil mear wurk nimme.
I am very happy with this car.	Ik bin hiel bliid mei dizze auto.
The house waited.	It hûs wachte.
I would do anything to prevent that.	Ik soe alles dwaan om dat foar te kommen.
I had to go back.	Ik moast werom.
A young woman, or so it was said.	In jonge frou, of sa waard sein.
And if you do not know it, you can not believe it.	En as jo it net witte, kinne jo it net leauwe.
How you have all been.	Hoe't jo allegear west hawwe.
Everyone was good, more or less.	Elkenien wie goed, min of mear.
She would have to wait.	Se soe wachtsje moatte.
Good after all.	Goed nei alles.
I hope we will be friends.	Ik hoopje dat wy freonen sille wêze.
I'm happy here.	Ik bin hjir bliid.
This letter is for him.	Dizze brief is foar him.
Let's go over.	Lit ús gean oer.
You have probably read about it.	Jo hawwe der wierskynlik oer lêzen.
I think it's true.	Ik tink dat it wier is.
They had been waiting for hours.	Se hiene al oeren wachte.
Can you help ?.	Kinne jo helpe?.
He does not know why.	Hy wit net wêrom.
But someone she seemed like obviously wanted to.	Mar ien dy't se like fansels wol nedich fielde.
The couple had two children.	It pear krige twa bern.
Everyone could see that the dog was still there.	Elkenien koe sjen dat de hûn der noch wie.
I want you to talk to me.	Ik wol dat jo mei my prate.
He stayed in.	Hy bleau yn.
Really bad stuff.	Echt minne dingen.
He saw it at once.	Hy seach it yn ien kear.
You had best go in one go.	Do hiest it bêste yn ien kear gean.
She tells us that there is nothing to worry about.	Se fertelle ús dat d'r neat om soargen te meitsjen is.
There are some major issues with it.	Der binne in pear grutte problemen mei it.
He had the time.	Hy hie de tiid.
Much more about this morning.	Folle mear oer dit moarn.
Mom said that.	Mem sei dat.
I know you now.	Ik ken dy no.
He does not think about it.	Hy tinkt der net oer nei.
It's easy to see why this is so.	It is maklik om te sjen wêrom dit sa is.
Hope you are doing well so far.	Hoopje dat jo it oant no ta goed dogge.
But he tried that on other people.	Mar hy besocht dat op oare minsken.
The door is open.	De doar stiet iepen.
This no longer works.	Dit wurket net mear.
Someone has to do something about it.	Dêr moat ien wat oan dwaan.
I will have the truth.	Ik sil de wierheid hawwe.
I feel it too.	Ik fiel it ek.
I hope you stay here.	Ik hoopje dat jo hjir bliuwe.
But we can not.	Mar wy kinne net.
He can not stay here.	Hy kin hjir net bliuwe.
I will definitely go back with my dad.	Ik sil nei alle gedachten gean werom mei myn heit.
Not one of us said much in the car.	Net ien fan ús sei folle yn 'e auto.
It's from before.	It is fan earder.
We hope to have that this year.	Wy hoopje dat dit jier te hawwen.
No one does it better.	Nimmen docht it better.
You can take that if you want.	Jo kinne dat nimme as jo wolle.
We believe that.	Dat leauwe wy.
Could not have been nicer.	Kin net moai west hawwe.
That we know now.	Dat witte wy no.
Be very scared.	Wês tige bang.
And let's go.	En lit gean.
You're a teacher.	Do bist in learaar.
You actually have no friends at the new school.	Jo hawwe eins gjin freonen op 'e nije skoalle.
She realized they had not been alone.	Se realisearre dat se net allinnich west hiene.
More of what?	Mear fan wat?
I just have no idea.	Ik ha gewoan gjin idee.
One guy said he just wanted to give me money.	Ien keardel sei dat hy my gewoan jild jaan woe.
Do that two things.	Meitsje dat twa dingen.
If you get better at it, you win.	As jo ​​der better fan wurde, winne jo.
That, even more so.	Dat, noch mear.
In fact, he never does.	Eins docht er dat noait.
They get things done.	Se krije dingen dien.
If you do.	As jo ​​dogge.
I will say friend.	Ik sil sizze freon.
But you have to find them.	Mar jo moatte se fine.
Nothing more was said about it.	Der waard neat mear oer sein.
Do not think about it yet.	Tink dêr noch net oan.
Everyone liked it.	Elkenien fûn it leuk.
He knew we were there.	Hy wist dat wy der wiene.
To participate.	Om mei te dwaan.
You will want to try it.	Jo sille it wol besykje.
She had been to this place before.	Se hie earder op dit plak west.
It's not like you can afford it.	It is net sa dat jo it net kinne betelje.
And from her photo she looks exactly the same.	En út har foto sjocht se krekt itselde.
I have a boyfriend and it's going well with us.	Ik haw in freon en it komt goed mei ús.
This was not true.	Dit wie net wier.
He could get everything now.	Hy koe no alles krije.
He had obviously been away.	Hy wie fansels fuort west.
You know what they're saying.	Jo witte wat se sizze.
They are not there.	Se binne der net.
And she did this in just three years.	En se die dit yn mar trije jier.
He was wrong again.	Hy wie wer ferkeard.
That should tell her now, she said.	Dat moat se no fertelle, sei se.
Same as you.	Itselde as dy.
Things you no longer have.	Dingen dy't jo net mear hawwe.
Every now and then we get sick.	Sa no en dan wurde wy siik.
There was a time when he was even in her.	Der wie in tiid dat hy sels yn har wie.
He did not want her.	Hy woe har net.
I'm not even sure it works.	Ik bin der net iens wis fan dat it wurket.
But he did not want it.	Mar hy woe it net.
That says something.	Dat seit wat.
This is a very real thing.	Dit is in heul echt ding.
So he had done something.	Sa hie er wat dien.
But what he had expected was nothing to what he realized.	Mar wat er ferwachte hie, wie neat oan wat er realisearre.
We do not need it.	Wy hawwe it net nedich.
I can do well.	Ik kin goed dwaan.
Who would have thought that, all that money and all.	Wa soe dat tinke, al dat jild en alles.
This was the place.	Dit wie it plak.
I could tell she was not angry either.	Ik koe sizze dat se ek net lilk wie.
After all, he's gone.	Nei alle gedachten is er fuort.
You have to be.	Jo moatte wêze.
Can't remember the last time that happened.	Kin net tinke oan de lêste kear dat barde.
Children always stay with their mother.	Bern bliuwe altyd by har mem.
So be it then.	Sa wêze it dan.
I just know we will be together.	Ik wit gewoan dat wy tegearre sille wêze.
We did everything right.	Wy diene alles goed.
But there is still work to be done.	Mar der is noch wurk te dwaan.
And he was not alone.	En hy wie net allinnich.
She had an idea.	Se hie in idee.
That's what, he thinks.	Dat is wat, tinkt er.
The boy is here.	De jonge is hjir.
We just have to see what happens then.	Wy moatte mar sjen wat der dan bart.
I love work.	Ik hâld fan wurk.
Let yourself go, see what you think.	Lit jo rûn, sjoch wat jo tinke.
More than ever.	Mear dan ea.
Home is home.	Thús is thús.
It works for me.	It wurket foar my.
Maybe we'll go next time.	Miskien geane wy ​​de oare kear.
But it's beautiful.	Mar it is moai.
He has done his job too well.	Hy hat syn wurk te goed dien.
I did not do that well.	Dat haw ik net goed dien.
I hope there is a better way to do this.	Ik hoopje dat d'r in bettere manier is om dit te dwaan.
For us, nothing matters anymore.	Foar ús makket neat mear út.
It has to be in there.	It moat der yn.
He was now back in first place.	Hy wie no wer op it earste plak.
If only the book hadn't reached her.	As it boek mar net by har kaam.
Maybe they are all.	Miskien binne it allegear.
It was just like they knew me.	It wie krekt as wisten se my.
One by water.	Ien troch wetter.
But maybe you have too.	Mar miskien hawwe jo ek.
But now comes the problem with this class.	Mar no komt it probleem mei dizze klasse.
A way to see who can play.	In manier om te sjen wa't spylje kin.
He thought of the woman.	Hy tocht oan de frou.
I said well, and that's how we met.	Ik sei goed, en dat is hoe't wy moete.
She has not decided yet.	Se hat har noch net besletten.
We would be so careful.	Wy soene sa foarsichtich wêze.
And that was enough.	En dat wie genôch.
I'm still thinking about it.	Ik tink der noch oer.
Another person enters the room.	In oare persoan komt de keamer yn.
She was waiting in her room with her friend.	Se wachte yn har keamer mei har freon.
And that left me with nothing.	En dat liet my mei neat.
She was not yet ready to go home.	Se wie noch net ree om nei hûs te gean.
This is the first time you've seen his picture.	Dit is de earste kear dat jo syn foto hawwe sjoen.
Otherwise it would just be.	Oars soe it gewoan wêze.
Hold on out.	Hâld der op út.
I have not been back since.	Ik wie sûnt net werom.
He might have had children.	Hy hie miskien bern krigen.
They do not know what will happen.	Se witte net wat der barre sil.
We do that with words.	Dat dogge wy mei wurden.
She tried one last time.	Se besocht in lêste kear.
You know what they can do, and what they have done.	Jo witte wat se kinne dwaan, en wat se dien hawwe.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Hy wist krekt wat er die.
Then a few more times.	Dan noch in pear kear.
She could not get enough of it.	Se koe der net genôch fan krije.
No one knows for sure.	Nimmen wit foar wis.
And it will not be.	En it sil net wêze.
Or really, question.	Of echt, fraach.
You need it more than anyone.	Jo hawwe it mear nedich as elkenien.
Let this be a place.	Lit dit plak wêze.
Otherwise he's gone.	Oars is er fuort.
We get that too.	Dat krije wy ek.
It is also not the last.	It is ek net de lêste.
What he the.	Wat hy die.
She does not like her photo taken.	Se hâldt net fan har foto makke.
He did the same with the others.	Hy die itselde mei de oare.
We get ready that way too.	Wy meitsje ús ek sa klear.
I doubt he's right.	Ik twifelje oan dat hy krekt is.
He did not even know how late it was.	Hy wist net iens mear hoe let it wie.
But this must be done.	Mar dit moat dien wurde.
I do it again.	Ik doch it wer.
I do not believe he could do this to me.	Ik leau net dat er my dit dwaan koe.
Something would happen.	Der soe wat barre.
That's what he says there.	Dat seit er dêr.
What did they do wrong?	Wat hawwe se ferkeard dien?
Or for money.	Of foar jild.
A really great one.	In echt grutte ien.
It's for everyone, not the couple.	It is foar elkenien, net de pear.
Yes, that's right.	Jo, dat wol.
He's sitting in the car.	Hy sit yn 'e auto.
I think of my room.	Ik tink oan myn keamer.
I also.	Ik ek.
He can be hard on himself, maybe too much.	Hy kin hurd wêze foar himsels, miskien te folle.
I'm here for this.	Ik bin hjir foar dit.
Now no one lived there.	No wenne dêr gjinien.
Away from his family and friends.	Fuort fan syn famylje en freonen.
Also will never be.	Ek sil nea wêze.
She's never been that way.	Se is noait sa.
Do not leave it.	Lit it net.
I have no idea how to do it.	Ik ha gjin idee hoe't jo it dogge.
Not sooner said than done!	Net earder sein as dien!
But it could be.	Mar it soe wêze kinne.
She just sits there and looks after everyone.	Se sit der mar en sjocht elkenien om.
I would like to know.	Ik soe it graach witte wolle.
My husband is just not one of you.	Myn man is gewoan net ien fan dy.
I tried this a few times.	Ik besocht dit in pear kear.
They prepared food for the family.	Se makke iten foar de famylje klear.
I never will.	Ik sil nea.
I think everyone knows that.	Ik tink dat elkenien dat wit.
But she did not have that.	Mar dat hie se net.
I was really happy to see it in my house.	Ik wie echt bliid om it yn myn hûs te sjen.
You need to know how to do it.	Jo moatte witte hoe't jo it dwaan.
But I can not make it.	Mar ik kin it net meitsje.
He's leaving with me.	Hy giet mei my fuort.
A mother must be with her children, she thought.	In mem moat by har bern wêze, tocht se.
Go away immediately.	Gean fuort fuort.
Often we just take in too much.	Faak nimme wy gewoan te folle op.
It goes on.	It giet oan.
And mine, well, mine was really good.	En myn, no, myn wie echt goed.
I gave them all one.	Ik joech se allegear ien.
Would anyone tell me what's going on?	Soe immen my fertelle wat der bart?
But that's what they think.	Mar dat is wat se tinke.
And everything is ready.	En alles is klear.
We'll see what happens.	Wy sille sjen wat der bart.
To be better.	Om better te wêzen.
He would be my first.	Hy soe myn earste wêze.
It happened around.	It barde om.
It's first hand.	It is earste hân.
I will be there.	Ik sil der wêze.
He had seen what was there.	Hy hie sjoen wat der wie.
But you know how it goes.	Mar jo witte hoe't it giet.
You're talking about something else now.	Jo hawwe it no oer wat oars.
You met them earlier.	Jo moete se earder.
On me this first time.	Op my dizze earste kear.
So, so good.	Sa, sa goed.
I can always leave.	Ik kin altyd fuort.
Do not do that thing.	Doch dat ding net.
This is not the best thing.	Dit is net it bêste ding.
Long live him!	Lang libben foar him!
For a few years.	Foar in pear jier.
He became angry.	Hy waard lilk.
There was nothing else to do.	Der wie neat oars te dwaan.
Just give me some time.	Jou my mar wat tiid.
I tried another question.	Ik besocht in oare fraach.
They want me here.	Se wolle my hjir.
I was not sure if it would work or not.	Ik wie net wis oft it soe wurkje of net.
You can stop worrying.	Jo kinne ophâlde mei soargen.
It was still early.	It wie noch betiid.
Nobody wants the truth.	Nimmen wol de wierheid.
He loves you.	Hy hâld fan dy.
It's fun.	It is leuk.
I had not heard him.	Ik hie him net heard.
I just want to find my friend.	Ik wol gewoan myn freon fine.
They put them to work.	Se sette se oan it wurk.
I should be able to do this.	Ik soe dit moatte kinne.
How is it made?	Hoe wurdt it makke?
I could not get your question here.	Ik koe jo fraach hjir net krije.
That was a bit difficult.	Dat wie wat dreech.
I was a man now.	Ik wie no in man.
And he is so into this.	En hy is sa yn dit.
He needed her to see.	Hy hie har nedich om te sjen.
That's gone too.	Dat is ek fuort.
No one knows for sure who she was.	Nimmen wit wis wa't se wie.
The boy in bed.	De jonge op bêd.
Even if they come from me.	Ek al komme se fan my.
I do not know what it is.	Ik wit net wat it is.
Do not do this again.	Doch dit net wer.
This is my life now.	Dit is no myn libben.
He stayed there long.	Hy bleau dêr lang.
Only it would have been someone who made it.	Allinnich soe it ien west hawwe dy't it makke.
Even if it was not me.	Al wie it my net.
Come with us.	Kom mei ús yn.
It does not hurt so much, if you really like a guy.	It docht net sa sear, as jo echt graach in keardel.
It looks like it's not ready yet.	It liket derop dat it no noch net klear is.
All she saw was what was coming.	Alles wat se seach wie wat der kaam.
Much more than necessary.	Folle mear dan nedich.
I did not want much.	Ik woe net folle.
There is no one else.	D'r is gjinien oars.
Not one of it.	Net ien fan it.
I think it's time.	Ik tink dat it tiid is.
They will talk about it.	Se sille der oer prate.
We have become a family.	Wy binne in famylje wurden.
This is how it came out.	Dit is hoe't it kaam út.
You are a very beautiful girl.	Do bist in hiel moai famke.
That would have been good.	Dat hie goed west.
He wanted to know what she thought.	Hy woe witte wat se tocht.
I can not speak against him.	Ik kin net tsjin him prate.
A woman on the bike.	In frou op de fyts.
Have you already found a job?	Hawwe jo al in baan fûn?
I was pretty happy.	Ik wie aardich bliid.
There's some truth to that, and that's not a problem.	Der is wat wierheid oan dat, en dat is gjin probleem.
It worked too.	It wurke ek.
They would talk.	Se soene prate.
Do read something.	Doch wat lêzen.
Time is running out.	De tiid is rûn.
It was easy to find her.	It wie maklik om har te finen.
I look like I was.	Ik sjoch der nei as dat ik wie.
He must have come in a lot of money.	Hy moat yn in protte jild kommen wêze.
I did not look old.	Ik seach der net âld út.
We do not know whether we should believe him or not.	Wy witte net oft wy him leauwe moatte of net.
We have a few questions for you.	Wy hawwe in pear fragen foar jo.
Nobody ever said anything.	Nimmen sei oait wat.
He was now almost talking to himself.	Hy wie no hast tsjin himsels te praten.
How to do some things with ash.	Hoe te dwaan wat dingen mei as.
Do you think he is difficult to buy?	Tinksto dat hy dreech is om te keapjen?
I did not do it.	Ik haw it net dien.
He gets better at it.	Hy wurdt der better yn.
No one lived here.	Gjinien wenne hjir.
And so it is today.	En sa is it hjoed noch.
I'm just looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der mar út nei.
We found you.	Wy hawwe dy fûn.
I love her though.	Ik hâld fan har wol.
Just what happens.	Krekt wat bart.
It wanted to.	It woe wol.
I also did not want to talk to him.	Ik woe ek net mei him prate.
Be water, my friend.	Wês wetter, myn freon.
So do you.	Dat dogge jo ek.
We're still waiting for it.	Wy wachtsje der noch op.
We will make good things out of it.	Wy sille hjir goede dingen fan meitsje.
But he only wanted to do one thing.	Mar hy woe mar ien dwaan.
This was a few months ago.	Dit wie in pear moanne lyn.
She looked very angry.	Se seach der tige lilk út.
It did him.	It die him.
We know where you are.	Wy witte wêr't jo binne.
Go on with your life.	Gean troch mei dyn libben.
I became ill and angry.	Ik waard siik en lilk.
He was so angry.	Hy wie sa lilk.
My question is here.	Myn fraach is hjir.
They will not have you.	Se sille jo net hawwe.
There is none.	Der is gjin.
Do what works.	Doch wat wurket.
But this is mine.	Mar dit is fan my.
You have time.	Do hast tiid.
As previously thought.	As earder tocht.
That's not difficult either.	Dat is ek net dreech.
This will not work.	Dit sil net wurkje.
Let's go back.	Lit ús werom gean.
He stands in front of the door, ready to leave.	Hy stiet foar de doar, klear om fuort te gean.
Her husband left.	Har man gie fuort.
He could hardly.	Hy koe hast net.
But we are not all the same.	Mar wy binne net allegear itselde.
She was not very pretty.	Se wie net hiel moai.
I could not let you know.	Ik koe dy net litte witte.
She's getting really old.	Se wurdt echt âld.
He easily made friends.	Hy makke maklik freonen.
When will he be ready.	Wannear sil er klear wêze.
It will come out.	It sil út.
This can be good or bad.	Dit kin goed of min wêze.
He was a boy again.	Hy wie wer in jonge.
He knows she's coming too late.	Hy wit dat se te let komt.
But his time was exactly the same.	Mar syn tiid wie krekt itselde.
One was female, the other three were male.	Ien wie frou, de oare trije wiene man.
He would probably do the same.	Hy soe wierskynlik itselde dwaan.
He will probably get the job.	Hy sil wierskynlik de baan krije.
If that does not work, go here for more help.	As dat net wurket, gean dan hjir foar mear help.
I know you well.	Ik ken dy goed.
In truth it was not.	Yn wierheid wie it net.
Ask her out well if she is no longer absorbed in the connection.	Freegje har as it moat.
A young woman.	In jonge frou.
When you are together, you are together.	As jo ​​tegearre binne, dan binne jo tegearre.
It was beautiful.	It wie moai.
Or they would take you.	Of se soene jo nimme.
But he was not.	Mar hy wie net.
I'll show you what we do here.	Ik sil dy sjen litte wat wy hjir dogge.
He will try to find food.	Hy sil besykje iten te finen.
I've never done it myself.	Ik haw it sels noait dien.
It was the best day of my life.	It wie de bêste dei fan myn libben.
I quickly took them out.	Ik die se gau út.
Earlier than you think.	Earder as jo tinke.
He's up to it again.	Hy is der wer oan.
Look at that guy.	Sjoch dy keardel.
She has never read a book.	Se hat noch noait in boek lêzen.
This was his last and only chance.	Dit wie syn lêste en ienige kâns.
Mom worked through.	Mem wurke troch.
Things you need to know, and now know so well.	Dingen dy't jo witte moatte, en no sa goed witte.
We want to know what you think.	Wy wolle witte wat jo tinke.
Her post photo was beautiful.	Har nei foto wie moai.
I think it's fast.	Ik tink dat it gau is.
I have to get in there.	Ik moat der yn.
Well, 'what if' away.	Goed, 'wat as' fuort.
It was all through you.	It wie allegear troch dy.
Just not everyone does.	Allinnich net elkenien docht.
He wanted to see more of it.	Hy woe der mear fan sjen.
That's as good as it can get.	Dat is sa goed as it kin.
How he wants to keep seeing me.	Hoe't er my wol bliuwe sjen.
I do not feel so sick.	Ik fiel my net sa siik.
And now he has it.	En no hat er it.
Wait, wait, wait.	Wachtsje, wachtsje, wachtsje.
He could see nothing.	Hy koe neat sjen.
I want to give that to other people.	Dat wol ik oan oare minsken jaan.
They all say the same thing.	Se sizze allegear itselde ding.
There are other things.	Der binne oare dingen.
All three of us.	Wy alle trije.
And if she was not.	En as se net wie.
Well, it has happened now and there is nothing we can do about it.	No, it is no bard en dêr kinne wy ​​neat oan dwaan.
There was not much to go on.	Der wie net folle te gean.
There are many.	Der binne in protte.
He is much more.	Hy is folle mear.
He was also not very tall.	Hy wie ek net hiel lang.
I wondered what they would be like.	Ik frege my ôf hoe't se wêze soene.
But it's done.	Mar it is dien.
Or something more.	Of wat mear.
I assume that was where he lived.	Ik nim oan dat it wie wêr't hy wenne.
Things may have been different.	Dingen kinne oars west hawwe.
She goes into the water.	Giet se yn it wetter.
It happened again.	It barde wer.
I think he might need some help.	Ik tink dat hy miskien wat help krije moat.
Well, leave everything to me.	No, lit alles oan my oer.
Good for now.	Goed foar no.
And it seems likely that they will.	En it liket wierskynlik dat se sille.
When in truth.	Wannear yn wierheid.
I do not.	ik net.
They are not made for that.	Dêr binne se net foar makke.
I did not think anyone would.	Ik tocht net dat immen soe.
Wait, what? 	Wachtsje, wat?
He did his job.	Hy die syn wurk.
They would never.	Se soene nea.
He would make one for her.	Hy soe ien foar har meitsje.
You have no idea how much.	Jo hawwe gjin idee hoefolle.
She agrees with me.	Se is it mei my iens.
Things are good now.	Dingen binne no goed.
It was her place.	It wie har plak.
Then they become happy again.	Dan wurde se wer bliid.
It's too good to be true.	It is te goed om te wêzen.
I wish there was more of that.	Ik winskje dat der mear fan dat wie.
Now you can have a seat.	No kinne jo in sit hawwe.
Not a bit.	Net in bytsje.
The money ran out.	It jild rûn op.
We get to do what we want, and everyone else can do that.	Wy krije te dwaan wat wy wolle, en dat kin elkenien oars.
It's hard to say whether it was a young man or woman.	It is dreech om te sizzen oft it wie in jonge man of frou.
With such a good idea, we can do this good work.	Mei sa'n goed idee kinne wy ​​dit goede wurk dwaan.
This he did not do.	Dit hat er net dien.
She likes me a lot when you think about it.	Se liket my tige, as jo der oer tinke.
He had friends there.	Hy hie dêr freonen.
He would buy them new.	Hy soe har nije keapje.
You not sure.	Jo net wis.
But that's all for today.	Mar dat is alles foar hjoed.
I found a job.	Ik fûn in baan.
I let him.	Ik lit him.
Go to life before it comes to you.	Gean nei it libben foardat it nei dy komt.
Then he and I will just talk about everything.	Dan sille ik en hy gewoan oer alles prate.
I just can not do it.	Ik kin it gewoan net dwaan.
If they help us, they can help us.	As se ús helpe, kinne se ús helpe.
Anyway, this is not about me.	Hoe dan ek, dit giet net oer my.
That's fine with me.	Dat is goed mei my.
Here things are somewhat different.	Hjir binne dingen wat oars.
I just tried it right now.	Ik haw it no krekt besocht.
You're never alone.	Do bist nea allinnich.
Just look, and you will find.	Sjoch mar, en jo fine.
Well, that's not entirely true.	No, dat is net hielendal wier.
He had to stop this now, or never.	Hy moast dit no ophâlde, of nea.
Not anymore.	No net mear.
We do not need help.	Wy hawwe gjin help nedich.
Everything else must remain where it is.	Al it oare moat bliuwe wêr't it is.
He had met a woman.	Hy hie in frou moete.
He will do nothing.	Hy sil neat dwaan.
They said it could not.	Se seine dat it net koe.
We're still working on it.	Wy wurkje der noch oan.
This became my home.	Dit waard myn thús.
I do not know what is in it.	Ik wit net wat der yn stiet.
I have no idea how he does it.	Ik ha gjin idee hoe't hy it docht.
I wonder if it's true.	Ik freegje my ôf oft it wier is.
This would not have been done around us.	Dit soe net om ús wei dien hawwe.
That's her favorite word.	Dat is har favorite wurd.
It so happened.	It barde sa.
You always said you did not need help.	Do hast altyd sein datst gjin help nedich hiest.
I wanted to say it.	Ik woe it sizze.
She was a beautiful girl.	Se wie in moai famke.
He came to my house after dinner.	Hy kaam nei it iten by my thús.
And a woman.	En in frou.
That's what you did a lot this weekend.	Dat diene jo dit wykein in protte.
Go to work now.	Gean no oan it wurk.
I will try to make these over the weekend.	Ik sil besykje dizze yn it wykein te meitsjen.
It has become a kind of words.	It is in soarte fan wurden wurden.
This is for sure.	Dizze is foar wis.
Let me be sure of what you think.	Lit my der wis fan wêze wat jo tinke.
I can see everything.	Ik kin alles sjen.
And so through the week every day.	En sa troch de wike alle dagen.
And the sooner he can do that, the better.	En hoe earder hy dat kin, hoe better.
It was time to dump her and move on.	It wie al tiid om wat te dwaan.
But there is still reason for hope.	Mar der is noch reden foar hope.
They are here for you.	Se binne hjir foar jo.
I need more money.	Ik haw mear jild nedich.
I can tell what he thinks.	Ik kin fertelle wat er tinkt.
There was no other such man.	Der wie gjin oare sa'n man.
She had said nothing.	Se hie neat sein.
I just did not want to scare him.	Ik woe him gewoan net bang meitsje.
If you can help someone, then you need to help them.	As jo ​​​​ien kinne helpe, dan moatte jo har helpe.
It may be good to be different.	It kin goed wêze om oars te wêzen.
I'm going now.	Ik gean no.
We have a meeting next week.	Wy hawwe nije wike in gearkomste.
This is her doing.	Dit is har dwaan.
I'll be good to you.	Ik sil goed foar dy wêze.
I had to keep the faith.	Ik moast it leauwe hâlde.
I never told you that.	Dat haw ik dy noait sein.
I'm here if you want to talk.	Ik bin hjir as jo wolle prate.
The old man was surprised.	De âld man wie ferrast.
You can see it clearly as everything.	Jo kinne it dúdlik sjen as alles.
This child has no mother or father.	Dit bern hat gjin mem of heit.
This whole city is.	Dizze hiele stêd is.
I'll be happy if you like it, she said.	Ik sil bliid wêze as jo it leuk fine, sei se.
She never did that.	Dat hat se noait dien.
But do not eat too much!	Mar net te folle ite!
Still just as beautiful.	Noch altyd like moai.
No, no die se.	No, no die se.
Nobody said much.	Nimmen sei folle.
It did me good to see her.	It die my goed om har te sjen.
They will do me no harm.	Se sille my neat dwaan.
Then he would have been free of it.	Dan hie er der frij fan west.
I do not know why this worked.	Ik wit net wêrom dit wurke.
You wonder what someone can do that.	Jo freegje jo ôf wat immen dat kin dwaan.
Please help me to get over it.	Help my asjebleaft om der oer te kommen.
Whatever the reason, it did not matter now.	Wat de reden ek wie, it makke no neat út.
I did not want to, we say.	Ik woe net, sizze wy.
I've seen it.	Ik haw it sjoen.
As film.	As film.
Maybe it was just the woman.	Miskien wie it allinnich de frou.
She would even see what happened.	Se soe sels sjen wat der barde.
He had said more than he wanted.	Hy hie mear sein as er woe.
The truth will come out.	De wierheid sil út.
Not sure exactly.	Net wis krekt.
He looked around but did not see me.	Hy seach om him hinne mar seach my net.
Had very, very sick.	Hie hiel, hiel siik.
And of course it is not.	En fansels is it net.
Now it's every day.	No is it alle dagen.
They buy everything.	Se keapje alles.
I hope it works.	Ik hoopje dat it wurket.
Your mom will still love you.	Jo mem sil noch fan dy hâlde.
I did not have such a time.	Ik hie net sa'n tiid.
It is necessary to keep them out.	It is nedich om se út te hâlden.
Your dad wanted you to have this.	Jo heit woe dat jo dit hawwe.
I could not see her yet.	Ik koe har noch net sjen.
Just tell me what you think.	Fertel my gewoan wat jo tinke.
Nice to have you here with me !.	Moai dat jo hjir by my hawwe!.
The kids are happy to see you.	De bern binne bliid om dy te sjen.
You can not look at him.	Jo kinne net nei him sjen.
That was never the problem.	Dat wie nea it probleem.
This let you get what you needed.	Dit liet jo krije wat jo nedich wiene.
No one had come to his door.	Gjinien wie by him oan de doar kommen.
Everyone knew, even children.	Elkenien wist, sels bern.
Otherwise you will never get a chance.	Oars sille jo noait kâns sjen.
Now he wants to go to bed.	No wol er op bêd.
People come to the door.	Minsken komme foar de doar.
She walked over to him.	Se rûn nei him ta.
The first was easy.	De earste wie maklik.
You do not go back to doing anything.	Jo geane net werom om neat te dwaan.
There are things that need to be done.	Der binne dingen dy't dien wurde moatte.
My question is why are you interested.	Myn fraach is wêrom binne jo ynteressearre.
We did not make this.	Wy hawwe dit net makke.
But not in a good way.	Mar net op in goede manier.
And it became my life.	En it waard myn libben.
Bad became good.	Min waard goed.
Of course we want to help '.	Fansels wolle wy graach helpe'.
He did not like it.	Hy hie it net leuk.
There was no one to talk to.	Der wie gjinien om mei te praten.
Feel good.	Fiel my goed.
In other words, people, people with and without name.	Mei oare wurden, minsken, minsken mei en sûnder namme.
But only one.	Mar mar ien.
I've never seen this.	Ik haw dit noait sjoen.
This is also done.	Dit wurdt ek dien.
Well, it's here.	No, it is hjir.
But we will find them.	Mar wy sille har fine.
That's what we did.	Dat ha wy dien.
I could not stop.	Ik koe net ophâlde.
He had no idea.	Hy hie gjin idee.
But now it's gone.	Mar no is it fuort.
How much life is in there.	Hoefolle libben sit der yn.
I need to get her back.	Ik moat har werom krije.
He could do anything.	Hy koe alles dwaan.
Nothing he did worked.	Neat wat er dien hat wurke.
I know why.	Ik wit wêrom.
I was wrong about that.	Dêr wie ik ferkeard oer.
They still do.	Dat dogge se noch.
He found it difficult to find a job.	Hy fûn it dreech om in baan te finen.
But they were not really convinced.	Mar se wiene net echt oertsjûge.
And of course there will be more.	En der komme fansels mear.
He had nothing to do with it.	Hy hie der neat oan om dat te dwaan.
Here we are.	Hjir binne wy.
It has to do this or it does nothing.	It moat dit dwaan of it docht neat.
A few more years ago.	Noch in pear jier lyn.
That was the best time of my life.	Dat wie de bêste tiid fan myn libben.
So much more.	Sa folle mear.
I'm really worried.	Ik bin echt soargen.
I wonder why you did not do that.	Ik freegje my ôf wêrom't jo dat net diene.
She seemed to do a lot of that.	Dêr like se in protte fan te dwaan.
I suppose.	Ik tink.
I tried to get her to do that.	Ik besocht har te krijen om dat te dwaan.
There is enough time !.	Der is genôch tiid!.
We can help you get one.	Wy kinne jo helpe om ien te krijen.
Or they might say nothing at all.	Of se sizze miskien hielendal neat.
Of course he is.	Fansels is hy.
I knew he knew everything about me.	Ik wist dat hy alles oer my wist.
I would not let it go.	Ik soe it net litte litte.
We'll see how it goes.	Wy sille sjen hoe't it giet.
It's going well.	It komt wol goed.
I will not take that against you.	Dat sil ik net tsjin dy nimme.
But it is no longer there.	Mar it is der net mear.
Look at that, you've never heard of it.	Sjoch it op, jo hawwe der noait fan heard.
But a few more questions.	Mar noch in pear fragen.
I could not do without him.	Ik koe net sûnder him.
He wanted to do his job.	Hy woe syn wurk dwaan.
We want that money back now.	Dat jild winskje wy no werom.
That's all the way through.	Dat is de hiele wei troch.
But it does not have to be that way.	Mar it hoecht net sa te wêzen.
He was my old man.	Hy wie myn âld man.
This is just playing money.	Dit is gewoan spylje jild.
It was just a question.	It wie mar in fraach.
I did not think this through.	Ik tocht dit net troch.
There is no money to do the things we have done.	D'r is gjin jild om de dingen te dwaan dy't wy dien hawwe.
Mom was up and running this time.	Mem wie op en rûn dizze tiid.
And maybe no one ever told him.	En miskien hat nimmen him ea ferteld.
It looked like you were sick.	It like der op datsto siik wiene.
We can not do it here.	Wy kinne it hjir net.
She knew the truth but said nothing.	Se wist de wierheid, mar sei neat.
Either way, you are going to give someone a very good job.	Hoe dan ek, jo sille immen in heul goede baan jaan.
I'm not quite sure.	Ik bin der net hielendal wis fan.
It was better, much better.	It wie better, folle better.
You look great.	Do sjocht der goed út.
What you need to do is find this time.	Wat jo moatte dwaan is dizze kear te finen.
He can be gone.	Hy kin fuort wêze.
You can put everything in there.	Jo kinne der alles yn sette.
If he wants to see me, he knows the way.	As er my sjen wol, wit er de wei.
You question everything you do, and everything you say.	Jo freegje alles wat jo dogge, en alles wat jo sizze.
And in hope.	En yn hope.
He will go with you.	Hy sil mei dy gean.
I knew him very well.	Ik koe him hiel goed.
He had asked her to help.	Hy hie har frege om te helpen.
Do not worry about him.	Sit gjin soargen oer him.
It seemed to go over very well.	It like hiel goed oer te gean.
Is just asking for problems.	Is gewoan om problemen freegje.
I tried the following but it does not work.	Ik haw it folgjende besocht, mar it wurket net.
We'll just find them and stick with them.	Wy sille se gewoan fine en by har hâlde.
And no one needed.	En gjinien nedich.
Who's there? 	Wa is dêr?
I gave him some water.	Ik joech him wat wetter.
asked the old man.	frege de âld man.
This would do.	Dizze soe dwaan.
I'm sitting in a pretty bad place.	Ik sit op in moai min plak.
I did not know at first why.	Ik wist earst net wêrom.
He died there.	Hy stoar dêr.
The boy's mother is angry with him.	De mem fan de jonge is lilk op him.
This can be heard.	Dit kin heard wurde.
That I will try first.	Dat sil ik earst besykje.
You'll regret it if you do not.	Jo sille der spyt fan krije as jo dat net dogge.
But only in name.	Mar allinnich yn namme.
Never happened to me before and never since.	Nea is my earder bard en nea sûnt.
I never want to go back to that life.	Ik wol noait werom nei dat libben.
He did not look too good.	Hy seach der net al te goed út.
There were two children.	Der wiene twa bern.
I did not get that.	Dat krige ik net.
He looked at the other man.	Hy seach nei de oare man.
It happened so fast.	It barde sa gau.
They always have something for you to do!	Se hawwe altyd wat foar jo te dwaan!
I thought.	Ik tocht.
Just talk to your friend.	Praat gewoan mei jo freon.
We want to know more about it.	Wy wolle der mear oer witte.
This is really, really clear!	Dit is echt, echt dúdlik!
They want to look at him.	Se wolle nei him sjen.
We have everything and everything.	Wy hawwe alles en alles.
That, of course, is not the case.	Dat is it fansels net.
This is actually pretty easy.	Dit is eins frij maklik.
You know where he is.	Jo witte wêr't hy is.
What is good is good, what is bad is wrong.	Wat goed is is goed, wat ferkeard is is ferkeard.
Not that photo.	Net dy foto.

She would have seen them again.	Se soe se wer sjoen hawwe.
Good with me.	Goed mei my.
I ask a man.	freegje ik in man.
We will never be.	Wy sille nea wêze.
This is what we really need to work on.	Dit is wat wy echt moatte wurkje oan.
Well, that's it.	No, dat is it.
She did not know what they were.	Se wist net wat se wiene.
And now we have a lot to do.	En no hawwe wy in protte te meitsjen.
But it does work.	Mar it docht it wurk.
It all started pretty well.	It begûn allegear frij goed.
This time will be here soon.	Dizze kear sil hjir gau wêze.
His family, for one.	Syn famylje, foar ien.
Do not be late!	Wês net te let!
That's what happened.	Dat is wat bard.
More of the same.	Mear fan itselde.

Nobody knew what.	Nimmen wist wat.
He was not sure what came out of it.	Hy wie net wis wat der út kaam.
I did not want to do this.	Ik woe dit net dwaan.

I was a teacher.	Ik wie in learaar.
There is no way to have it all.	D'r is gjin manier om it allegear te hawwen.
Life in the city was hard.	It libben yn 'e stêd wie hurd.

Think about the book.	Tink oer it boek.

Of all that they were.	Fan alles wat se wiene.
And my new book.	En myn nije boek.

No one was found.	Der binne gjinien fûn.

Two years, maybe three.	Twa jier, miskien trije.

They think differently.	Se tinke oars.
I have to see for myself.	Ik moat sels sjen.
It hurt, but he did not say a word.	It die sear, mar hy sei gjin wurd.
You're not my father.	Do bist myn heit net.
I had them.	Ik hie se.
She was not happy.	Se wie net bliid.
I told him not to talk.	Ik fertelde him net te praten.
Something's going on with this thing.	Der bart wat mei dit ding.
Not us.	Net ús.
That was days ago.	Dat wie dagen lyn.
The food was really good.	It iten wie echt goed.
They know nothing else.	Se witte neat oars.
Anyway, we're really happy since he came back.	Hoe dan ek, wy binne echt bliid sûnt hy werom kaam.
There is nothing to do.	Der is neat te dwaan.
I feel hurt.	Ik fiel my sear.
.	.
Did not love her life.	Hâlden net fan har libben.
The whole house was gone.	It hiele hûs wie fuort.
What do you think was going on?	Wat tinke jo dat der oan de hân wie?
Three to a room.	Trije nei in keamer.
That may seem like a lot of time.	Dat kin lykje as in protte tiid.
I was alone all that time.	Ik wie al dy tiid allinnich.
She had seen it.	Se hie it sjoen.
Let's see what happens.	Lit sjen wat der bart.
Not so the first time.	Net sa de earste kear.
They just show us their work.	Se litte ús gewoan har wurk sjen.
This time, it really, really matters.	Dizze kear makket it echt, echt út.
He was happy with himself.	Hy wie bliid mei himsels.
They do it there.	Se dogge it dêr.
This was where she was before she died.	Dit wie wêr't se wie foardat se stoar.
Same thing with that.	Itselde ding mei dat.
I thought people would see it.	Ik tocht dat de minsken it sjen soene.
To our name.	Oan ús namme.
We'll talk about it another time.	Wy kinne der in oare kear oer prate.
Both have their place.	Beide hawwe har plak.
He was ready.	Hy wie klear.
You do not have to take it as something.	Jo hoege it net as wat te nimmen.
Think of your best friends at school.	Tink oan jo bêste freonen op skoalle.
It will be easy to find.	It sil maklik te finen wêze.
You know how she is.	Jo witte hoe't se is.
You know you can.	Jo witte dat jo kinne.
So much for that, the whole food thing.	Safolle foar dat, it hiele iten ding.
And she needed that.	En dat hie se nedich.
They both knew that.	Dat wisten se beide.
We'll be back.	Wy komme werom.
There is no one who does it.	Der is gjinien dy't it docht.
There is no self here now.	D'r is hjir no gjin sels.
Anyone could take them.	Elkenien koe se nimme.
Maybe he gave some more time.	Miskien joech er wat mear tiid.
She looked beautiful.	Se seach der wol moai út.
My kids love me.	Myn bern hâlde fan my.
No one is around.	Gjinien is om.
I can not tell you when.	Ik kin dy net sizze wannear.
My mother made food.	Myn mem makke iten.
I was happy to do that.	Ik wie bliid om dat te dwaan.
I'm afraid of what they might do.	Ik bin bang foar wat se dwaan kinne.
It was not much.	It wie net folle.
Let me not think otherwise.	Lit my net oars tinke.
Not sure how it all works.	Net wis hoe't it allegear wurket.
That is now clear.	Dat is no dúdlik.
We can help !.	Wy kinne helpe!.
It will wait forever.	It sil foar altyd wachtsje.
I'm just looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch mar foar my út.
I want him to come here.	Ik wol dat er hjir komt.
He has an office with me.	Hy hat in kantoar by my.
About you, about me.	Oer dy, oer my.
Nothing to worry about, people.	Neat om soargen oer, minsken.
See what your friends think of them.	Sjoch wat jo freonen fan har tinke.
That, it worked and it worked well.	Dat, it wurke en it wurke goed.
And neither of us would say a word about what had happened.	En net ien fan ús soe in wurd sizze oer wat der bard wie.
Until last month, that is.	Oant ferline moanne, dat wol.
My father died on the last day of school.	Myn heit stoar op de lêste dei fan skoalle.
I became.	Ik waard.
Maybe you are.	Miskien bist.
All day.	De hiele dei.
It's time to go to school.	It is tiid om nei skoalle te gean.
Do you think he's coming at me?	Tinksto dat er op my komt?
And he had.	En hy hie.
She's been here before and she just does it.	Se hat hjir earder west en se docht it gewoan.
You get mine.	Jo krije myn.
You told her.	Jo hawwe har ferteld.
He looked around carefully and came out again.	Hy seach goed om en kaam wer út.
I want you to go.	Ik wol dy gean.
She got her money he got his.	Se krige har jild hy krige syn.
He looked at his father.	Hy seach nei syn heit.
I can not believe it yet.	Ik kin it noch net leauwe.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe te dwaan dit.
You told me that.	Jo hawwe my dat ferteld.
We have a dog.	Wy hawwe in hûn.
You have never been.	Jo hawwe nea west.
It's me he wants.	It is my hy wol.
I think it can do nothing but help us.	Ik tink dat it neat kin dwaan as ús helpe.
I had to talk.	Ik moast prate.
He was not and he never would be.	Hy wie net en hy soe noait wêze.
They are really well done.	Se binne echt goed dien.
So has everyone.	Sa hat elkenien.
It just came to me.	It kaam krekt by my.
But he is happy.	Mar hy is bliid.
Of course he wanted her.	Fansels woe er har.
Are you going to buy that?	Sille jo dat keapje?
People stay there a lot.	Minsken bliuwe dêr in protte.
Of course, there has to be a better way.	Fansels moat der in bettere manier wêze.
You're late for school!	Do bist te let op skoalle!
It's pretty easy to see why.	It is frij maklik om te sjen wêrom.
And he would not talk about it.	En hy soe der net oer prate.
She did not even know what she would do if she did.	Se wist net iens wat se dwaan soe as se it die.
It was a good place to do the work.	It wie in goed plak om it wurk te dwaan.
People had friends here.	Minsken hiene freonen hjir.
Your car is gone.	Jo auto is fuort.
I knew it was going to happen.	Ik wist dat it barre soe.
They are one and the same.	Se binne ien en itselde.
Everyone looked up.	Elkenien seach op.
She had gone to his bed.	Se wie nei syn bêd gien.
That said, it's not all bad.	Dat sei, it is net allegear min.
This was a good thing to do, he said to himself.	Dit wie in goed ding om te dwaan, sei er tsjin himsels.
The good that it has done will continue.	It goede dat it dien hat sil bliuwe.
I do not know if this can work.	Ik wit net oft dit kin wurkje.
But it's a truth.	Mar it is in wierheid.
Go to the house.	Gean nei it hûs.
These days, they are even easy to buy.	Dizze dagen binne se sels maklik te keapjen.
We will never be happy again.	Wy sille noait wer bliid wêze.
I feel at home.	Ik fiel my in thús.
The question has been decided.	De fraach is besletten.
I finished it.	Ik die it ôf.
Go buy it.	Gean it keapje.
He totally fell in love with his work.	Hy rekke hielendal yn syn wurk.
But that was a problem for another day.	Mar dat wie in probleem foar in oare dei.
It was her big chance.	It wie har grutte kâns.
We could talk.	Wy koene prate.
I just want you.	Ik wol allinnich dy.
Love this guy.	Hâld fan dizze keardel.
Do not ask me again.	Freegje my net wer.
Not even for me.	Net iens foar my.
Hope he can get home soon.	Hoopje dat er gau thús komme kin.
The word is there.	It wurd is der.
More than one person.	Mear as ien persoan.
He says she's saying it's not him, but.	Hy seit dat se seit dat it net hy is, mar.
I'm not into this for the money.	Ik bin net yn dit foar it jild.
I felt bad.	Ik hie it min.
That's the kind of movie this is !.	Dat is it soarte fan film dit is!.
For the water.	Foar it wetter.
I love her and do not want to leave.	Ik hâld fan har en wol net fuort.
We do not want that.	Dat wolle wy net.
With words we can make clear what we want.	Mei wurden kinne wy ​​dúdlik meitsje wat wy wolle.
There was everything to say, and nothing.	Der wie alles te sizzen, en neat.
I would probably pay more.	Ik soe wierskynlik mear betelje.
Or one of the best.	Of ien fan de bêste.
You do not do that.	Dat dogge jo net.
In a month.	Oer in moanne.
But wait, there's more.	Mar wachtsje, der is mear.
He worked hard for it.	Hy wurke der hurd foar.
You know what you need it for.	Jo witte wêr't jo it foar nedich hawwe.
It's better that way.	It is better sa.
Let her go.	Lit har gean.
We're having a good time.	Wy ha in goede tiid.
Yours and yours and yours.	Dyn en dyn en dyn.
I do not know how they do it.	Ik wit net hoe't se it dogge.
It felt like one.	It fielde as ien.
I felt happy again.	Ik fielde my wer bliid.
He has no idea that what he is doing is wrong.	Hy hat gjin idee dat wat er docht ferkeard is.
He was just too clear.	Hy wie gewoan te dúdlik.
They may not like it, but they can not help it.	Se kinne it miskien net leuk fine, mar se kinne it net helpe.
It may be wrong, but he thought it was good.	It kin ferkeard wêze, mar hy tocht dat it goed wie.
I worked there.	Ik haw der wurke.
That this is probably your problem.	Dat dit is wierskynlik jo probleem.
I love you so much.	Ik hâld sa fan dy.
I handed her to him and ran.	Ik joech har oan him en rûn.
I just am.	Ik bin gewoan.
But they were not enough.	Mar se wiene net genôch.
One that had to be seen.	Ien dy't sjoen wurde moast.
You may be surprised what comes before you.	Jo kinne wêze ferrast wat komt foar dy.
But it was so fun.	Mar it wie sa leuk.
Let's do what she says and go.	Litte wy dwaan wat se seit en gean.
See what he's up to.	Sjoch wêr't hy oan docht.
I was home, sick in bed.	Ik wie thús, siik op bêd.
I used to do that.	Dat die ik eartiids.
What happened, happened.	Wat barde, barde.
He does not know that it is us.	Hy wit net dat it ús binne.
Get to bed early from now on!	Gean fan no ôf betiid op bêd!
White on white.	Wit op wit.
This is what they do not tell you.	Dit is wat se jo net fertelle.
Well, let me be clear.	No, lit my dúdlik wêze.
It can be anything.	It kin fan alles wêze.
He did not know.	Hy wist it net.
Have no problems so far.	Hawwe oant no ta gjin problemen.
Not to nothing, not even from something.	Net nei neat, sels net fan wat ôf.
It's too much for one person.	It is te folle foar ien persoan.
No one almost ever goes to the movie alone.	Nimmen giet hast ea allinnich nei de film.
I like to think about you.	Ik tink graach oer dy.
They were in trouble.	Se wiene yn de problemen.
You worry about nothing.	Jo meitsje jo soargen foar neat.
I just had to be here.	Ik moast hjir mar wêze.
I'm not anymore.	Ik bin net mear.
There seemed to be nothing to do.	Der like neat út te dwaan.
He arrived on time to see her off.	Hy kaam op 'e tiid om har ôf te sjen.
But she could do nothing about it.	Mar dêr koe se neat oan dwaan.
I actually had.	Ik hie eins.
Make the time.	Meitsje de tiid.
I'm the same.	Ik bin itselde.
And so are we.	En wy binne ek.
I expected this.	Ik ferwachte dit.
People really need this.	Minsken hawwe dit echt nedich.
And nothing happened.	En der barde neat.
No one knows what will happen tomorrow, ever.	Nimmen wit wat der moarn barre sil, ea.
What can she see in him?	Wat kin se yn him sjen?
This used to work well, but not now.	Dit wurke eartiids goed, mar no net.
That's clear to me.	Dat is my dúdlik.
That was not true.	Dat wie net wier.
I really wanted to be with you.	Ik woe echt mei dy wurde.
I'll be that man.	Ik sil dy man wêze.
A friend of his was there.	In freon fan him wie dêr.
It was her home.	It wie har thús.
I was a little worried about that.	Ik wie der wat soargen oer.
I want to know what's going on here.	Ik wol witte wat hjir bart.
And there he tells her that he can not.	En dêr seit er tsjin har dat er net kin.
We've done it now, and maybe it's a week late.	Wy hawwe it no dien, en miskien is it in wike te let.
It was for the best.	It wie foar it bêste.
You have it.	Jo hawwe it.
I've heard it's good.	Ik haw heard dat it goed is.
I'm not the same.	Ik bin net itselde.
I knew that was the reason.	Ik wist dat dat de reden wie.
See west.	Sjoch west.
He's really old.	Hy is echt âld.
Make it all out of town.	Makke it hielendal út 'e stêd.
That did not happen often.	Dat barde net faak.
We need to get better.	Wy moatte better wurde.
But there was still money.	Mar dêr wie noch jild.
This happens too often.	Dit bart te faak.
I'm still there.	Ik bin der noch.
I love you.	Ik hâld fan dy.
Maybe he had done it this year.	Miskien hie er it dit jier dien.
That girl becomes so much of me.	Dat famke wurdt sa fan my.
It should work.	It moat wurkje.
Two things can happen from here.	Twa dingen kinne barre fan hjir.
I want to know why.	Ik wol witte wêrom.
Many people knew.	In protte minsken wisten.
They talk long.	Se prate lang.
Do not worry, do not worry about it.	Sit gjin soargen, dêr net oer.
I must say.	Ik moat sizze.
He would come.	Hy soe komme.
To other people, she has to look good.	Foar oare minsken moat se goed lykje.
The man said he had to get to work.	De man sei dat er oan it wurk moast.
This must be found.	Dit moat fûn wurde.
He now had one.	Hy hie no ien.
Of course, they had no time.	Fansels hiene se gjin tiid.
There is no such thing.	Der is net sa'n ding.
To me, it didn’t seem right.	Foar my like it net goed.
Of course, you are not.	Fansels, do bist net.
Let's just say your name came up.	Litte wy mar sizze dat jo namme kaam.
He would tell me nothing.	Hy soe my neat fertelle.
I want that for all my kids.	Ik wol dat foar al myn bern.
But of course we will stay this year.	Mar fansels bliuwe wy dit jier noch oer.
This was what she had to do herself.	Dit wie wat se sels dwaan moast.
Everyone knows everyone else, it's a big family.	Elkenien ken elkenien oars, it is in grutte famylje.
We can not have that.	Dat kinne wy ​​net hawwe.
I'm too old.	Ik bin te âld.
He asked me if they were good to eat.	Hy frege my oft se goed te iten wiene.
You want someone you like.	Jo wolle immen dy't jo leuk.
How does that work? 	Hoe wurket dat?
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
Someone must.	Immen moat.
They will be well away from here now.	Se sille hjir no goed fuort wêze.
We have a problem.	Wy hawwe in probleem.
I always feel like there is something or someone with me.	Ik fiel my altyd dat der wat of immen by my is.
It's up to you, the people.	It is oan jo, de minsken.
Take the dog out.	Nim de hûn út.
Mom liked it there.	Mem fûn it dêr moai.
She was my prisoner.	Se wie myn finzenis.
No one yet.	Noch gjinien.
No one comes to the door.	Nimmen komt foar de doar.
But he knew it did.	Mar hy wist dat it die.
She did not need anyone.	Se hie gjinien nedich.
I saw him.	Ik seach him.
It could not.	It koe net.
Family is everything.	Famylje is alles.
He would love to visit this city.	Hy mei graach dizze stêd besykje.
I did not even know how he felt.	Ik wist net iens hoe't hy fielde.
But it never looked good.	Mar it like noait goed.
She's my best best friend.	Se is myn bêste bêste freon.
We'll say that to your friends.	Dat sizze wy dan oan dyn freonen.
I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.	Ik bin der net wis fan wat ik ferkeard doch.
Of course there has to be.	Fansels moat der wêze.
She said well.	Se sei goed.
He said he was still working on his book.	Hy sei dat er noch wurke oan syn boek.
The plan looks into everything.	It plan sjocht alles yn.
If she could not make much of it, she would.	As se der net folle fan meitsje koe, soene se wol.
My dad bought it.	Myn heit kocht it.
Doing what he wanted it to do.	It dwaan wat hy woe dat it dwaan soe.
Mom wasn't there either.	Mem wie der mar ek net.
Had actually thought of you today.	Hie hjoed eins oan dy tocht.
They were so wrong.	Se wiene sa ferkeard.
I should tell her to stop.	Ik soe har sizze moatte ophâlde.
See, if you do this, then do it well.	Sjoch, as jo dit dogge, doch it dan goed.
Maybe that would be good.	Miskien soe dat wol goed wêze.
You do not have to do that yourself.	Dat hoege jo eins net sels te dwaan.
I think they can make it.	Ik tink dat se it kinne meitsje.
You're more of a man than he is.	Do bist mear in man as hy is.
Where will we stay tonight?	Wêr sille wy fannacht bliuwe?
I could not take the child now.	Ik koe it bern no net nimme.
I felt very hurt.	Ik fielde my tige sear.
But show me.	Mar lit my sjen.
Both of us felt like someone in the house.	Beide fan ús fielde immen yn 'e hûs.
There is nothing more.	Der is neat mear.
And you sure did.	En jo hawwe wis.
Or they tell you something that is not true.	Of se fertelle jo wat dat net wier is.
Let it happen.	Gean it barre.
We've been here too long.	Wy hawwe hjir al te lang west.
Not so fun.	Net sa leuk.
But he is not.	Mar hy is net.
I know she's very worried about him.	Ik wit dat se tige soargen oer him is.
This will be made as necessary.	Dit sil sa nedich makke wurde.
You stay here.	Jo bliuwe hjir.
None of these are easy.	Gjin fan dizze binne maklik.
But that is no longer the case.	Mar dat is net mear sa.
I want what is real.	Ik wol wat eins is.
Well, they had never told us that.	No, dat hiene se ús noait ferteld.
It should not be so.	It soe net sa wêze moatte.
This could never get old.	Dit koe nea âld wurde.
The only problem is that that is not true.	It ienige probleem is dat dat net wier is.
But it will come in handy.	Mar it sil goed komme.
That's what they're doing this year.	Dat dogge se dit jier.
He would like to try.	Hy soe wol besykje.
I feel for the child.	Ik fiel foar it bern.
We did not ask why.	Wy hawwe net frege wêrom.
But he did not think he would.	Mar hy tocht net dat er dat soe.
But the idea is the same.	Mar it idee is itselde.
I'm a little worried.	Ik bin wat soargen.
I know you're angry.	Ik wit datst lilk bist.
She had only one child.	Se hie mar ien bern.
But this, they know, is necessary.	Mar dit, se witte, is nedich.
You eat whatever they put in front of you.	Jo ite wat wat se foar jo sette.
I gave up and went to bed.	Ik joech my op en gie op bêd.
I was both angry at her and worried about her.	Ik wie beide lilk op har en soargen oer har.
Is there time left?	Is der tiid oer?
Help me find them.	Help my se te finen.
It struck me, too.	It kaam my ek oan.
You buy them.	Jo keapje se.
Even after all that time.	Ek nei al dy tiid.
The city is more than an hour's drive away.	De stêd is mear as in oere riden fuort.
But it goes on.	Mar it giet troch.
I do not know that word.	Ik wit net dat wurd.
But no longer her home.	Mar net mear har thús.
He's been here before.	Hy hat hjir earder west.
It will be there tonight.	It sil der fannacht wêze.
Nothing more to come home to.	Neat mear om thús te kommen.
But he was also different.	Mar hy wie ek oars.
I'll tell her what we are.	Ik sil har fertelle wat wy binne.
Until then a nice weekend.	Oant dan in moai wykein.
I could not see who it was, but there was one.	Ik koe net sjen wa't it wie, mar der wie ien.
That was it, no more.	Dat wie it, mear net.
You are and he is not, just yet.	Jo binne en hy is net, krekt noch.
It's time to dump her and move on.	It is tiid om no fuort te gean.
Food was bad.	Iten wie min.
I had been wrong.	Ik hie ferkeard west.
Everyone knew it, of course.	Elkenien wist it fansels.
And it came to me.	En it kaam by my.
That did not happen here.	Dat is hjir net bard.
They are our reason for being.	Se binne ús reden foar wêzen.
And that's a problem.	En dat is in probleem.
Life in prison is difficult.	It libben yn 'e finzenis is dreech.
That's what I would like.	Dat soe ik wol graach wolle.
We had been good friends.	Wy hiene goede freonen west.
He is always on time.	Hy is altyd op tiid.
You probably were not.	Jo wiene wierskynlik net.
But they also need to be able to work with you.	Mar se moatte ek mei jo kinne wurkje.
They need to have time left over.	Se moatte tiid hawwe oer.
They can not do without me.	Se kinne net sûnder my.
Another woman probably.	In oare frou wierskynlik.
There was nothing like that.	Der wie neat as dat.
That was what happened.	Dat wie wat barde.
Not so this time.	Net sa dizze kear.
And it still does.	En it docht noch.
And so did she.	En dat hie se ek.
She would never make it.	Se soe it noait meitsje.
I need more money.	Ik haw mear jild nedich.
We love the same things.	Wy hâlde fan deselde dingen.
Many things.	In protte dingen.
Be with you all day long.	In hiele dei by dy wêze.
It could never work.	It koe nea wurkje.
I feel good.	Ik fiel my wol.
You want something more out of life.	Jo wolle wat mear út it libben.
He had hope.	Hy hie hope.
I do not see them in this car.	Ik sjoch se net yn dizze auto.
He used to make things for me.	Hy makke eartiids dingen foar my.
He looks very tired.	Hy sjocht der tige wurch út.
He is what he is.	Hy is wat hy is.
I can 't tell anyone.	Ik kin gjinien fertelle.
Somehow it was hard to talk to her.	Op ien of oare manier wie it dreech om mei har te praten.
This is kind of my best work to date.	Dit is sa'n bytsje myn bêste wurk oant no ta.
And he made himself ready to go.	En hy makke him klear om te gean.
We are who we are.	Wy binne wa't wy binne.
It did not.	It die net.
I can better get back to work.	Ik kin better wer oan it wurk.
Found a way.	In manier fûn.
How hard is it to get a job these days?	Hoe dreech is it om in baan te krijen dizze dagen?
For some reason he looked away from me.	Om ien of oare reden seach er my fuort.
For once in our lives we need to stop being afraid.	Foar ien kear yn ús libben moatte wy ophâlde te wêzen bang.
And of course they want to win.	En fansels wolle se winne.
That's a bit much.	Dat is in bytsje folle.
Everyone is happy.	Elkenien is bliid.
They have never met.	Se hawwe nea moete.
I can not say what.	Ik kin net sizze wat.
And no one would buy it.	En nimmen soe it keapje.
We've been working on it for a month.	Wy binne der al in moanne oan dien.
It was really good.	It wie echt goed.
They have to go back to school.	Se moatte werom nei skoalle.
There are things that can be done to help.	D'r binne dingen dy't dien wurde kinne om te helpen.
She's not good.	Se is net goed.
Kids, stop it!	Bern, hâld der op!
No one approached her.	Nimmen kaam har oan.
For me, but you know, not really.	Foar my, mar jo witte, net echt.
I wish he worked for me.	Ik winskje dat hy foar my wurke.
They have no problem.	Se hawwe gjin probleem.
I do not know who did it.	Ik wit net wa't it dien hat.
She did not want to be late.	Se woe net te let komme.
Right then, right there.	Krekt dan, krekt dêr.
She worked from home.	Se wurke fan hûs.
We have one here too.	Wy hawwe hjir ek ien.
I did it for a reason.	Ik die it foar in reden.
Do you want to	Wolle jo
She felt so good, he thought.	Se fielde har sa goed, tocht er.
There has to be a way to make money from it.	Der moat in manier wêze om der jild fan te meitsjen.
It was hard to get away.	It wie dreech om fuort te gean.
Let me tell you something that happened a few weeks ago.	Lit my jo wat fertelle dat in pear wike lyn barde.
People are not always what they seem to be.	Minsken binne net altyd wat se lykje te wêzen.
People are too	Minsken binne ek
It must be from me.	It moat fan my wêze.
We have a lot of time talking.	Wy hawwe in protte tiid oan it praten.
But something's going on with this guy over there.	Mar der bart wat mei dizze keardel dêr.
I now see something to do.	Ik sjoch no wat te dwaan.
The water can not help for long.	It wetter kin net lang helpe.
Make people happy.	Meitsje minsken bliid.
It makes me too long for you.	It makket my te lang nei dy.
They are fun and easy.	Se binne leuk en maklik.
If we do not come, go away.	As wy net komme, gean fuort.
I just do not know how to make it so.	Ik wit gewoan net hoe ik it sa meitsje moat.
But you have to find it, and soon.	Mar jo moatte it fine, en gau.
My wife and children are still there.	Myn frou en bern binne der noch.
I do not care if you do not like them.	Ik jou it net om as jo se net leuk fine.
Be not interested.	Wês net ynteressearre.
There was something about her.	Der wie wat oan har.
Be sure of that.	Wês der wis fan.
I never had that.	Dat hie ik noait.
I do not want to wait.	Ik wol net wachtsje.
But think about it.	Mar tink der oer.
Make a time that works best for you.	Meitsje in tiid dy't it bêste foar jo wurket.
But we do not like it.	Mar wy hâlde der net fan.
And nothing was ever the same again.	En neat wie oait wer itselde.
One has a mother.	En har mem.
You can not go wrong with this.	Jo kinne net ferkeard gean mei dizze.
This book is for the whole family.	Dit boek is foar de hiele famylje.
So he looked at me.	Sa seach er my oan.
She's always had it.	Se hat it altyd hân.
We talk to them as if they were people.	Wy prate tsjin har as binne se minsken.
That is, if you know what's good for you.	Dat is, as jo witte wat goed foar jo is.
He was too scared to talk.	Hy wie te bang om te praten.
That the he.	Dat die hy.
He really wanted to work with this great man.	Hy woe echt wurkje mei dizze grutte man.
He did it as if it were nothing to him.	Hy die it as wie it neat foar him.
It's too late for me now.	It is my no te let.
Everything about him was, really.	Alles oer him wie, echt.
But yours is.	Mar dyn is.
They really do.	Dat dogge se echt.
Just hold it in your hand.	Hâld it gewoan yn jo hân.
You have nothing to worry about.	Jo hawwe neat te soargen oer.
I know what the problem is.	Ik wit wat it probleem is.
There may have been, of course.	Der kin fansels west hawwe.
I can never really find it.	Ik kin it noait echt fine.
Someone can get angry at me.	Immen kin lilk op my wurde.
I will say more.	Ik sil mear sizze.
We were gone, but we were not gone.	Wy wiene fuort, mar wy wiene net fuort.
He makes me happy, he is my best friend.	Hy makket my bliid, hy is myn bêste freon.
I can no longer.	Ik kin net mear.
I could find her place.	Ik koe har plak fine.
It is better to come to a meeting early.	It is better om betiid oan in gearkomste te kommen.
For others, it may not be.	Foar de oare kin it net wêze.
None of that had worked.	Gjin fan dat hie wurke.
Watch my movie.	Sjoch myn film.
Do it every day.	Doch it alle dagen.
You should not be late for class.	Jo moatte net te let wêze yn 'e klasse.
He was angry.	Hy wie lilk.
It was so well done.	It wie sa goed dien.
And that's what.	En dat is wat.
I do not know how you feel about it.	Ik wit net hoe't jo it mei jo hawwe.
Things never quite work out.	Dingen wurkje noait hielendal út.
That may or may not work.	Dat kin wol of net.
There is plenty around.	Der is genôch om hinne.
As in, one.	As yn, ien.
Also ask if anything else is needed.	Freegje ek oft der noch wat nedich is.
It will not be easy.	It sil net maklik wêze.
Back to work.	Wer oan it wurk.
He does his word to us.	Hy docht syn wurd oan ús.
So do children.	Dat dogge bern.
And we did nothing.	En wy hawwe neat dien.
They do not talk for very long.	Se prate net echt lang.
But here come the last two.	Mar hjir komme de lêste twa.
You're the first person we're found to know anything about her.	Jo binne de earste persoan dy't wy hawwe fûn dy't wat oer har wit.
More of this.	Mear fan dit.
But he could do that.	Mar dêr koe er wol mei.
One two, one two.	Ien twa, ien twa.
None of it was good.	Gjin fan it wie goed.
And some more.	En wat noch mear.
And no one came out too well.	En gjinien kaam der te goed út.
She knows everything.	Se wit alles.
So we get through this.	Sa komme wy troch dit.
Everything else does.	Al it oare docht.
But he was by no means the last.	Mar hy wie lang net de lêste.
Maybe there's another reason.	Miskien is der in oare reden.
She did not see either.	Se seach ek net.
Who are these people?	Wa binne dy minsken?
Everyone wants to keep it that way.	Elkenien wol it sa hâlde.
You know this as well as we do.	Jo witte dit like goed as wy.
They have been here all along.	Se hawwe hjir de hiele tiid west.
Are you sure about this ?.	Binne jo hjir wis fan?.
He came quite often.	Hy kaam frij faak.
So it's for sure.	Sa is it wis.
I ask him if he wants to come back.	Ik freegje him oft er werom wol.
It was good for me.	It wie goed foar my.
And watch a lot of movie.	En sjoch in protte film.
These are all his children.	Dit binne allegear syn bern.
But that's all you get.	Mar dat is alles wat jo krije.
Where have you been?	Wêr hawwe jo west?
Then next month.	Dan takom moanne.
Why he was here was the question.	Wêrom't er hjir wie, wie de fraach.
It felt so real.	It fielde sa echt.
But this is also my next plan.	Mar dit is ek myn folgjende plan.
We have it free.	Wy hawwe it frij.
Everyone looked at her.	Elkenien seach har oan.
You now have three children.	Jo hawwe no trije bern.
Talk about why they do what they do.	Prate oer wêrom't se dogge wat se dogge.
Watch it, play it.	Sjoch it, spylje it.
So he thought she was beautiful.	Sa tocht er dat se moai wie.
I would love to see what else you have there.	Ik soe graach sjen wat jo dêr noch hawwe.
Not everyone has to do both.	Net elkenien moat beide dwaan.
But the people here do not know better.	Mar de minsken hjir witte net better.
You get to bed.	Jo komme op bêd.
We do not believe they have seen us.	Wy leauwe net dat se ús sjoen hawwe.
There is no place for you here.	D'r is hjir gjin plak foar jo.
Here at home.	Hjir thús.
They could not know it.	Se koene it net witte.
She's not ready to come out yet.	Se is noch net ree om út te kommen.
I told him and asked him the same thing.	Ik fertelde him en frege him itselde.
It has never been.	It hat nea west.
There really needs to be more of both.	Der moat echt mear fan beide.
It's not as easy as it seems.	It is net sa maklik as it liket.
Did not know you were out.	Wist net dat jo út wiene.
What else is this.	Wat oars is dit.
But then, for him, maybe it did.	Mar dan, foar him, miskien it die.
But that's just not true.	Mar dat is gewoan net wier.
They want to be talked to.	Se wolle der mei praat wurde.
I'm not sure.	Ik wis net.
We need to do it for our children.	Wy moatte it dwaan foar ús bern.
Not one that anyone could see.	Net ien dy't elkenien koe sjen.
Not exactly, of course.	Net krekt, fansels.
I think this time is good.	Ik tink dat dizze tiid goed is.
We just do not know what time he was there.	Wy witte gewoan net hoe let hy der wie.
It's just that we're too busy.	It is gewoan dat wy it te drok hawwe.
I will be so happy to see you.	Ik sil sa bliid wêze dy te sjen.
It’s not that we haven’t tried.	It is net dat wy net besocht hawwe.
They also looked tired.	Se hiene ek wurch like.
She was just scared.	Se wie gewoan bang.
They would not either.	Se soene ek net.
But he could, or did not want to, pay them.	Mar hy koe, of woe net, se betelje.
So would that.	Sa soe dat wol.
He got three years for it.	Hy krige der trije jier foar.
They had nothing to say.	Se hiene neat te sizzen.
Now it's her life.	No is it har libben.
People had their problems.	Minsken hiene har problemen.
You can see it here, here and here.	Jo kinne hjir, hjir en hjir sjen.
Maybe you should go with him?	Miskien moatte jo mei him gean?
Maybe for everyone who was with him.	Miskien foar elkenien dy't by him wie.
There is also one for you.	Der is ek ien foar dy.
The words are too.	De wurden binne ek.
Let her stay with the man.	Lit har by de man bliuwe.
I am tired.	Ik bin wurch.
Be happy to see him.	Wês bliid om him te sjen.
Maybe it doesn 't matter.	Miskien makket it neat út.
More than enough.	Mear as genôch.
Well, and the name.	No, en de namme.
That's the only reason to do it.	Dat is de ienige reden om it te dwaan.
You have enough work for the whole year.	Jo hawwe genôch wurk foar it hiele jier.
That's so.	Dat is sa.
You will find yours.	Jo sille jo fine.
No one seemed sure.	Nimmen like wis.
That's just about everyone.	Dat is krekt oer elkenien.
Go home.	Gean nei hûs.
We're staying here tonight.	Wy bliuwe hjir fannacht.
Fill me up.	Folle my op.
You're wrong.	Do bist ferkeard.
A whole year.	In hiel jier.
I did not know that.	Dat wist ik net.
But it's what happens.	Mar it is wat bart.
If you need my help, just ask.	As jo ​​​​myn help nedich binne, freegje dan gewoan.
She was angry.	Se wie lilk.
I want her here now.	Ik wol har hjir no.
She did not need that.	Dat hie se net nedich.
He is my life.	Hy is myn libben.
This, of course, should never be done.	Dit moat fansels nea dien wurde.
They had no clear plan.	Se hiene gjin dúdlik plan.
She had worked hard.	Se hie hurd wurke.
Well, there are not.	No, der binne net.
Now he has to get them out of his place and soon.	No moat er se fan syn plak ôf en gau.
Today they do not.	Hjoed dogge se net.
So did children.	Dat diene bern.
She had tried to tell him that it was not allowed.	Se hie besocht him te fertellen dat it net mocht.
Quite a bit, really.	Hiel wat, echt.
They have to wait.	Se moatte wachtsje.
Either way, you get the idea.	Hoe dan ek, jo krije it idee.
They would not be happy.	Se soene net bliid wêze.
Now other people are asking me how it should be.	No freegje oare minsken my hoe't it moat.
Or maybe this one.	Of miskien dizze.
Not for you, but for you.	Net foar dy, mar foar dy.
This is happening too hard.	Dit bart te hurd.
Talk to everyone.	Praat mei elkenien.
Do not look at me like that.	Sjoch my net sa oan.
Where they can do more.	Wêr't se mear kinne.
Neither good nor bad.	Noch goed noch min.
He now lives alone.	Hy wennet no allinnich.
I've heard of her.	Ik ha wol fan har heard.
We stand up for each other.	Wy komme foar elkoar op.
I just thought you might want to be clear.	Ik tocht gewoan dat jo miskien wol dúdlik wurde.
There is no way.	Der is gjin wei.
But he was scared.	Mar hy wie bang.
Can help you.	Kin dy helpe.
It was better that they did not know it until the time was right.	It wie better dat se it net wisten oant de tiid goed wie.
That I can show you.	Dat kin ik oan dy sjen.
Now do it.	No doch it.
Be his friend.	Wês syn freon.
Nobody really knows.	Nimmen wit it echt.
But it was something else.	Mar it wie wat oars.
It seemed to be the first of many.	It like de earste fan in protte te wêzen.
We've done it before.	Wy hawwe it earder dien.
I was not for that.	Dêr wie ik net foar.
He speaks for himself.	Hy prate foar himsels.
We have work to do.	Wy hawwe wurk te dwaan.
Things seemed even better.	Dingen like noch better.
That's if you're totally interested.	Dat is as jo hielendal ynteressearre binne.
There are a lot of good people here.	Der binne in protte goede minsken hjir.
I need to know.	Ik moat it witte.
They are always there for me.	Se binne der altyd foar my.
For now, it's just water.	Foar no is it gewoan wetter.
It was more than a.	It wie mear as in.
This is a difficult year for many people.	Dit is in dreech jier foar in protte minsken.
Just take it off.	Nim mar ôf.
It was not certain who did it.	It wie net wis wa't it die.
He could say nothing.	Hy koe neat sizze.
We need to help each other.	Wy moatte elkoar helpe.
You know it does not work that way.	Jo witte dat it net sa wurket.
Do it all at once.	Doch it yn ien kear.
They got him in the car.	Se krigen him yn de auto.
We need it more than ever.	Wy hawwe it mear nedich as ea.
I have not read it yet.	Ik haw it noch net lêzen.
Whatever you do, keep it up.	Wat jo ek dogge, hâld it troch.
All we can do is hope for the best.	Alles wat wy kinne dwaan is hoopje op it bêste.
What he says is so true.	Wat er seit is sa wier.
It had happened.	It wie bard.
It started with the city.	It begûn mei de stêd.
But he did not stop there.	Mar hy bleau dêr net by.
He wanted to be with her.	Hy woe by har wêze.
I do not think anyone can do that hard.	Ik tocht net dat immen sa hurd kin.
We want these.	Wy wolle dizze.
His young wife.	Syn jonge frou.
We'll leave when the work is done.	Wy geane fuort as it wurk klear is.
Is still a little too much with the book.	Is noch wat te folle by it boek.
And that was just food.	En dat wie mar iten.
And so we did.	En dat diene wy.
You do not get money.	Jo krije gjin jild.
I'm not here to hurt you.	Ik bin hjir net om dy sear te dwaan.
And there it came true.	En dêr kaam it wier.
Can anyone help me with this ?.	Kin immen my helpe mei dizze?.
She would do the same now.	Dat soe se no ek dwaan.
I've seen it in a book.	Ik haw it yn in boek sjoen.
We like it.	Wy fine it leuk.
One more thing.	Noch ien ding.
It's different every day.	It is alle dagen oars.
Which is bad.	Wat min is.
Both the good and the bad of me.	Sawol it goede as it minne fan my.
Do not look so scared.	Sjoch net sa bang.
This is a very nice place.	Dit is in hiel moai plak.
My house is still standing.	Myn hûs stiet noch.
Mine went very well.	Myn gie tige goed.
He almost never goes out.	Hy giet hast noait út.
It was his last words.	It wiene syn lêste wurden.
But you never know.	Mar jo witte noait.
Well, they want you now.	No, se wolle dy no.
Nothing to make the time.	Neat om de tiid te meitsjen.
This is not one.	Dit is net ien.
There was a full moon last night.	Der wie fannacht in folle moanne.
And would let me know.	En soe my witte litte.
I really did not have to.	Ik moast echt net.
This is actually what they believe.	Dit is eins wat se leauwe.
Everything you said is so true.	Alles wat jo seine is sa wier.
But it can be different.	Mar it kin oars.
But there is a problem with that.	Mar dêr is in probleem mei.
We do not even need a reason.	Wy hawwe net iens in reden nedich.
And when he gets there, he does something.	En as er dêr komt, docht er wat.
A year ago, she arrived there.	In jier lyn kaam se dêr oan.
This she has not seen before.	Dit hat se noch net earder sjoen.
But we must give it a chance.	Mar wy moatte it in kâns jaan.
I took no money.	Ik naam gjin jild.
This is what it looks like.	Dit is wat dat liket.
A child can tell.	In bern kin fertelle.
I think she can do whatever she wants.	Ik tink dat se dwaan kin wat se wol.
We talk for hours and hours.	Wy prate oeren en oeren.
So anyway, the police are coming back today.	Sa hoe dan ek, de plysje komt hjoed werom.
You just have to tell me something about you.	Jo moatte my gewoan wat oer dy fertelle.
If you do not like to buy.	As jo ​​net graach keapje.
Let it stay that way.	Lit it sa bliuwe.
He felt very sick himself.	Hy fielde him sels tige siik.
You should not get tired.	Jo moatte net wurch wurde.
See how beautiful it is.	Sjoch hoe moai it is.
I thought you should know.	Ik tocht dat jo it witte moatte.
You're awake.	Do bist wekker.
He needed more time.	Hy hie mear tiid nedich.
And we got it.	En wy krigen it.
There were no words for it.	Der wiene gjin wurden foar.
I could not stand it.	Ik koe it net oan.
I put a little bit of everything here.	Ik sette hjir in bytsje fan alles.
I came for you.	Ik kaam foar dy.
He's not here today.	Hy is hjir hjoed net.
You have not seen anything yet.	Jo hawwe noch neat sjoen.
It's old but beautiful.	It is âld mar moai.
But there were no people.	Mar der wiene gjin minsken.
When we get there.	As wy der oan ta komme.
I did not think he would find anything, but he seemed so sure.	Ik tocht net dat er wat fine soe, mar hy like sa wis.
He's good.	Hy is goed.
There he sat.	Dêr siet er.
He will do for keeping.	Hy sil dwaan foar it hâlden.
I've never seen it before.	Ik haw it noch noait earder sjoen.
So they stay.	Sa bliuwe se.
The mother of everyone.	De mem fan elkenien.
To look? 	Sjen?
said a woman.	sei in frou.
I hope you can see that.	Ik hoopje dat jo dat sjen kinne.
And that's exactly what happened.	En dat is krekt wat der bard is.
It was rather different.	It wie earder oars.
It's just a.	It is allinnich in.
There would never be time.	Der soe noait tiid wêze.
We can still get there.	Wy kinne der noch komme.
Tell me what happened.	Fertel my wat der bard is.
And it does not have to be that way anymore.	En it hoecht net mear sa te wêzen.
How are you.	Hoe is it mei dy.
You take care of yourself.	Jo soargje foar dy.
This is what happens.	Dit is wat bart.
I do not have these.	Ik haw dizze net.
Probably he was waiting for someone.	Wierskynlik wachte er op immen.
In fact, you have to work for nothing.	Eins moatte jo foar neat wurkje.
But it did not matter much.	Mar it makke net folle út.
They are really hard to come by.	Se binne echt dreech om te kommen.
You do not have to be here.	Jo hoege hjir net te wêzen.
It's a seat that has seen better days.	It is in sit dy't bettere dagen sjoen hat.
Maybe even scared.	Miskien sels bang.
It seems to be free.	It liket frij te wêzen.
She thinks we can handle it.	Se tinkt dat wy it oan kinne.
It could not have been easy.	It kin net maklik west hawwe.
Only for you.	Allinnich foar dy.
I really like him a lot.	Ik hâld echt in protte fan him.
To do these things.	Om dizze dingen te dwaan.
But, that's not how the question came to me.	Mar, dat is net hoe't de fraach by my kaam.
He was trying to figure out how old he must be.	Hy besocht út te finen hoe âld hy wêze moast.
He really could not.	Hy koe wier net.
When it's tomorrow, we'll be even more ready.	As it moarn is, sille wy noch mear klear wêze.
An old man and his dog.	In âld man en syn hûn.
I was too tired to eat.	Ik wie te wurch om te iten.
But no one knows that until it actually happens.	Mar nimmen wit dat oant it eins bart.
Food did not interest her.	Iten ynteressearre har net.
But that was not what happened.	Mar dat wie net wat der barde.
If I do it like this, it does not work, nothing happens.	As ik it sa doch, wurket it net, bart der gewoan neat.
The mother is getting old.	De mem wurdt âld.
Talk to the police.	Praat mei de plysje.
I have to work on that.	Dêr moat ik oan wurkje.
Should you have to.	Soe jo moatte.
It occurred to me, of course.	It kaam my fansels.
I thought nothing of it at first.	Ik tocht der earst neat fan.
She did not know what she was thinking.	Se wist net wat se tocht.
Whatever it was, she did not seem to find it.	Wat it ek wie, se like it net te finen.
I'll tell you now.	Ik sil jo no sizze.
I just came here myself.	Ik bin hjir sels krekt kommen.
If not, ask someone around you.	As net, freegje dan immen om dy hinne.
Like more, more.	Graach mear, mear.
Well, now is our time.	No, no is ús tiid.
That can not be!	Dat kin net!
Why he wants that is not entirely clear.	Wêrom't er dat wol, is net hielendal dúdlik.
Wait here for the police.	Wachtsje hjir op de plysje.
It was not, of course.	It wie net, fansels.
I would have done the same.	Dat hie ik ek dien.
He had to be.	Hy moast wêze.
That's us.	Dat binne wy.
Talk whatever you want.	Praat alles wat jo wolle.
But it still happens.	Mar it bart noch.
You can not get it better from me.	Jo kinne it net better fan my krije.
I'm sick of seeing them that way.	Ik bin siik om se sa te sjen.
He was not sure.	Hy wie der net wis fan.
First we need to have a home.	Earst moatte wy in hûs hawwe.
But not about this.	Mar net oer dit.
I will never have it so good.	Ik sil it noait sa goed ha.
She can be you or me.	Se kin jo of my wêze.
Nothing else comes up.	Der komt neat oars op.
We have never even agreed.	Wy hawwe it sels noait net iens west.
You may have read about him.	Jo hawwe miskien oer him lêzen.
Every now and then.	Sa no en dan.
I know it.	Ik wit it.
We never knew the man's name.	Wy wisten nea de namme fan de man.
I love seeing friends and making new ones.	Ik hâld fan freonen te sjen en nije te meitsjen.
See also away.	Sjoch ek fuort.
It was only a word or two.	It wie mar in wurd as twa.
Nobody saw it.	Nimmen seach it.
Nothing was ever done.	Der waard ea neat dien.
Now it's time to talk.	No is it tiid om te praten.
They would ask.	Se soene freegje.
I wanted to do something that would not do.	Ik woe wat dwaan dat dat net dwaan soe.
Let's do that.	Litte wy dat dwaan.
This is just.	Dit is gewoan.
That's life.	Dat is it libben.
I have no problem with that at all.	Ik haw der hielendal gjin probleem mei.
And how many.	En hoefolle.
He has tried over and over again.	Hy hat oer en wer besocht.
If you know where to look.	As jo ​​witte wêr't te sjen.
The kids do what they want.	De bern dogge wat se wolle.
And we love her.	En wy hâlde fan har.
Same thing really.	Itselde ding echt.
You need to know something.	Jo moatte wat witte.
Why do they do this?	Wêrom dogge se dit?
You can do it from home.	Jo kinne it fan hûs dwaan.
He had expected this.	Hy hie dit ferwachte.
So much had happened and so much had to happen.	Der wie safolle bard en der moast noch safolle barre.
I can hardly believe it.	Ik kin it hast net leauwe.
My mother is sick.	Myn mem is siik.
It's right there.	It is krekt dêr.
I did not really like this.	Ik fûn dizze net echt leuk.
I think we do not know much about his past.	Ik tink dat wy net folle witte oer syn ferline.
I was very happy at home.	Ik wie tige bliid thús.
Things will be different.	Dingen sille oars wêze.
Here are a few.	Hjir binne in pear.
Many things.	In protte dingen.
That's your problem, not mine.	Dat is dyn probleem, net myn.
They are good enough.	Se binne genôch goed genôch.
I have no idea what you would do with it yourself.	Ik haw gjin idee wat jo der sels mei dwaan soene.
I know you'll never hurt me.	Ik wit dat jo my noait sear dwaan soene.
It would not have been so difficult.	It soe net sa dreech west hawwe.
It would be sick for both of us.	It soe siik wêze foar ús beide.
So far they have not.	Oant no ta hawwe se se net.
The only time they were alone was at the office.	De iennichste kear dat se allinnich wiene wie op it kantoar.
And he should know.	En hy soe witte moatte.
But that's not very nice.	Mar dat is net hiel aardich.
The man had them.	De man hie se.
Not just first.	Net allinnich earst.
She never comes back.	Se komt nea werom.
He walked over to me.	Hy rûn nei my ta.
Well, maybe not everything.	No, miskien net alles.
People without work.	Minsken sûnder wurk.
Back in time.	Wer werom yn de tiid.
Not many people will like this	Net in protte minsken sille dit leuk fine
You've read it.	Jo hawwe it lêzen.
Do not worry.	Meitsje jo gjin soargen.
She was too late.	Se wie te let.
He wasn't sure if he ever would, not at all.	Hy wie der net wis fan oft er oait soe, net hielendal.
Back to such a time.	Werom nei sa'n tiid.
The other must be.	De oare moat wêze.
But it really is not that difficult.	Mar it is echt net sa dreech.
A few have it.	In pear hawwe it.
She will know what we need.	Se sil witte wat wy nedich binne.
I had never done that before.	Dat hie ik noch nea dien.
The police knew the girl very well.	De plysje koe it famke tige goed.
He said when he got there he would know.	Hy sei doe't er dêr kaam hy soe witte.
But that does not make it bad.	Mar dat makket it net min.
They all come at once!	Se komme allegear yn ien kear!
This is not the first time this has happened.	It is net de earste kear dat dit bard is.
He told me he did not know.	Hy fertelde my dat er it net wist.
I knew you wanted to spend time with him.	Ik wist dat jo tiid mei him wolle wolle.
I should have seen it earlier.	Ik hie it earder sjen moatten.
Talk to friends, and or family about this too.	Praat mei freonen, en of famylje ek oer dit.
So are they.	Sa binne se.
Make sure you know what you're talking about.	Wês wis dat jo witte wêr't jo it oer hawwe.
So they know what it is.	Sa witte se wat it is.
We talk for a few hours.	Wy prate in pear oeren.
Everyone knew the song.	Elkenien wist it liet.
This must stop.	Dit moat ophâlde.
He wondered why.	Hy frege him ôf wêrom.
Why are we not talking about food tonight?	Wêrom prate wy dit fannacht net oer it iten?
That's what they'll be interested in.	Dat is wat se sille wêze ynteressearre yn.
I wanted to be a mother one day.	Ik woe op in dei mem wurde.
Life was hard.	It libben wie dreech.
He let me talk last night, and he should not have.	Hy liet my fannacht prate, en dat hie er net moatten.
You never know what they'll be going through.	Jo witte nea wat se geane troch.
I knew what she said it would be.	Ik wist dat wat se sei it soe wêze.
I went through so much.	Ik gie troch safolle.
Just leave everything alone and love each other.	Lit alles gewoan en hâld fan elkoar.
I'm just a kid.	Ik bin mar in bern.
Or find something better to do.	Of fine wat better te dwaan.
But he does not.	Mar dat docht er net.
Things will never work out for us.	Dingen sille nea wurkje út foar ús.
He had been ill for a long time.	Hy wie al lang siik.
He's too angry.	Hy is te lilk.
I've never been there before.	Ik ha der noch nea west.
I would do the same for you.	Ik soe itselde foar dy dwaan.
She wished she had never met the man.	Se woe dat se de man noait moete hie.
Boy, he does what he can.	Jonge, hy docht as er kin.
I saw them for a long time.	Ik seach se lang.
But you have to help us.	Mar jo moatte ús helpe.
I'm done talking to my mom.	Ik bin klear mei myn mem praten.
Of course, it can be different.	Fansels kin it oars.
You asked for it and here it is.	Jo hawwe der om frege en hjir is it.
Too much, too soon, if you ask me.	Te folle, te gau, as jo it my freegje.
But for us, it was different.	Mar foar ús wie it oars.
There were no problems.	Der wiene gjin problemen.
I can not take her home.	Ik kin har net nei hûs nimme.
If you think so, you're wrong, my girl.	As jo ​​dat tinke, binne jo ferkeard, myn famke.
Or it can do both over time.	Of it kin beide oer de tiid dwaan.
He was a boy.	Hy wie in jonge.
I do not want to know anything.	Ik wol neat witte.
But there was no help for it.	Mar der wie gjin help foar.
I know where he lived.	Ik wit wêr't hy wenne.
No food, no water.	Gjin iten, gjin wetter.
We could try a few things.	Wy koene in pear dingen besykje.
We do not let him take any more of us.	Wy litte him net mear fan ús nimme.
I love you here.	Ik hâld fan dy hjir.
He has me there.	Hy hat my dêr.
Soon the two become good friends.	Al gau wurde de twa goede freonen.
She realized it as for the first time.	Se realisearre it as foar de earste kear.
Not one of us will ever know.	Net ien fan ús sil ea witte.
It was easy to wake up.	It wie maklik om wekker te wurden.
Do not say anything.	Net sizze neat.
You want that too.	Dat wolle jo ek.
Just do it.	Doch dy gewoan.
Many more were not surprised.	In protte mear wiene net ferrast.
I need them to give them.	Ik haw se nedich om har te jaan.
They were almost too late.	Se wiene hast te let.
What does it do.	Wat docht it.
The couple has no children.	It pear hat gjin bern.
They put the word out.	Se sette it wurd út.
No more talking.	Net mear praten.
Not without seeing them first.	Net sûnder se earst te sjen.
Had had home.	Hie hie thús.
Today it has only one.	Hjoed hat it mar ien.
So he got a new job.	Sa krige er in nije baan.
I've never had a problem.	Ik haw noait in probleem hân.
But she could not.	Mar se koe net.
It would be nice to see his mother again.	It soe moai wêze om syn mem wer te sjen.
And he would not have it long.	En hy soe it net lang hawwe.
It's going well.	It komt goed.
It did not look good.	It seach der net goed út.
So long we have to come up with a plan.	Sa lang moatte wy mei in plan komme.
He will see you.	Hy sil dy sjen.
He was just.	Hy wie gewoan.
But it does not have to be that way.	Mar it hoecht net sa te wêzen.
She will be able to get on a bus easily.	Se sil maklik op in bus komme kinne.
Let's not do this here.	Litte wy dit hjir net dwaan.
He was sure she would come to him.	Hy wie der wis fan dat se nei him ta kommen soe.
A year ago it would not have been.	In jier lyn soe it net west hawwe.
My family and friends love these too.	Myn famylje en freonen hâlde dizze ek.
It was not a good movie.	It wie gjin goede film.
Maybe to read.	Miskien om te lêzen.
And it gets even better.	En it wurdt noch better.
We drove to a party.	Wy binne nei in feest riden.
What do we have here?	Wat hawwe wy hjir?
Since this.	Sûnt dizze.
That's what we did.	Dat diene wy.
It does not stop there.	Dêr hâldt it net op.
Keep your house.	Hâld dyn hûs.
I'm fine with this.	Ik bin goed mei dizze.
They will do it if they can.	Se sille it dwaan as se kinne.
I'm also not sure they would help much.	Ik bin der ek net wis fan dat se folle helpe soene.
I do not have much time.	Ik ha net safolle tiid.
I know there are enough.	Ik wit dat der genôch binne.
Do not mind that.	Hâld dat der net tsjin.
I would not ask anyone to give it up.	Ik soe gjinien freegje om it op te jaan.
Let's try this.	Litte wy dit besykje.
I walked all the way home.	Ik rûn hielendal nei hûs.
But someone she seemed like obviously wanted to.	Mar ien dy't se like fansels wol nedich fielde.
They all work well.	Se wurkje allegear goed.
Exactly that.	Krekt dat.
It and make more we should not.	It en meitsje mear wy moatte net.
Soon we were both gone.	Al gau wiene wy ​​beide fuort.
It should not happen.	It moat net barre.
I think he was real too.	Ik tink dat hy ek echt wie.
Just look around you.	Sjoch gewoan om dy hinne.
You just need something to get you going.	Jo hawwe gewoan wat nedich om jo te gean.
She had to, she told him.	Se moast, sei se tsjin him.
That's fine, said the man.	Dat is goed, sei de man.
We all love you.	Wy hâlde allegear fan dy.
That was it for me.	Dat wie it foar my.
She asked if she had done anything wrong.	Se frege oft se wat ferkeard dien hie.
That work must be done tomorrow.	Dat wurk moat moarn dien wurde.
There are many things to love here!	D'r binne hjir in protte dingen om fan te hâlden!
Life was too hard.	It libben wie te hurd.
That done.	Dat dien.
This is good again.	Dit is wer goed.
I felt it was easy to take.	Ik fielde it maklik te nimmen.
You do all the work.	Jo dogge al it wurk.
This should not happen.	Dit soe net moatte barre.
Kids love that movie.	Bern hâlde fan dy film.
Take us back.	Nim ús werom.
I have tried hard to do my job well.	Ik haw hurd besocht om myn wurk goed te dwaan.
People will love me.	Minsken sille fan my hâlde.
I needed more time than that.	Ik hie mear tiid nedich as dat.
Well, maybe he.	No, miskien hy.
Maybe it was never really there.	Miskien wie it der noait echt.
She never told us anything to say.	Se nea ferteld ús wat te sizzen.
No other dog comes to do anything good.	Gjin oare hûn komt om wat goed te dwaan.
This car has seen better days.	Dizze auto hat bettere dagen sjoen.
He looked around at his mother.	Hy seach om him hinne nei syn mem.
You need to do this carefully.	Jo moatte dit foarsichtich dwaan.
It all seemed like fun.	It like allegear wol leuk.
But that's our life.	Mar dat is ús libben.
Would love to.	Wol wol graach.
The reason we can not know.	De reden kinne wy ​​net witte.
I want his children.	Ik wol syn bern.
You hope they do.	Jo hoopje dat se dogge.
This was the only one I could think of.	Dit wie de ienige dy't ik koe tinke oan.
He was not that kind.	Hy wie net sa'n soarte.
It's not hard to see why this should be so.	It is net dreech om te sjen wêrom dit sa moat.
We were too busy.	Wy hiene it te drok.
We can not do that.	Dat kinne wy ​​net.
And many of us have bought it.	En in protte fan ús hawwe it kocht.
It's my house.	It is myn hûs.
No one came for her yet.	Noch gjinien kaam foar har.
A lot of people here get none.	In protte minsken hjir krije gjinien.
I sat in on it.	Ik siet der oer yn.
But this will never happen.	Mar dit sil nea barre.
I've never read it before.	Ik haw it noch noait earder lêzen.
Same as a woman.	Itselde as in frou.
I thought she was a good mother.	Ik tocht dat se in goede mem wie.
Time to move on.	Tiid om mar troch te gean.
It needs to get better.	It moat better.
He was one of us.	Hy wie ien fan ús.
The school did not know what to do with it.	De skoalle wist net wat er mei him oan moast.
But this is not.	Mar dit is net.
But he was gone.	Mar hy wie fuort.
I asked one man how long this thing had been.	Ik frege ien man hoe lang dit ding west hie.
So far they have not.	Oant no hawwe se net.
Wait until my work is done.	Wachtsje oant myn wurk dien is.
And he had found one.	En hy hie ien fûn.
Whatever she did worked.	Wat se ek dien hat, hat wurke.
I know this, but it was not really a reason.	Ik wit dit, mar it wie net echt in reden.
It has to be just one thing.	It moat mar ien ding wêze.
It should come today or tomorrow.	It soe hjoed of moarn komme moatte.
I would do it.	Ik soe it dwaan.
Maybe, never.	Miskien, nea.
He did not do well.	Hy die it net goed.
He obviously did not know.	Hy wist it fansels net.
Not bit by bit.	Net bytsje by bytsje.
I was both.	Ik wie beide.
The picture has become more.	De foto is mear wurden.
It was her first film, just like that.	It wie har earste film, krekt as dy.
She seemed to have no chance.	Se like gjin kâns te meitsjen.
He did not wait until the man spoke.	Hy wachte net oant de man praat.
Will have to wait until after work.	Sil moatte wachtsje oant nei it wurk.
This could be his life.	Dit kin syn libben wêze.
She looks at me.	Se sjocht my oan.
That should be difficult.	Dat moat dreech wurde.
I look at him better.	Ik sjoch him better oan.
That is not the problem here.	Dat is hjir net it probleem.
I can do that myself now.	Dat kin ik no sels dwaan.
That should never happen.	Dat soe nea barre moatte.
She needed him too much.	Se hie him te folle nedich.
I got them out.	Ik ha se út.
I want to do this with.	Ik wol dit dien mei.
I know a lot of things about you.	Ik wit in protte dingen oer dy.
We have become very good friends.	Wy binne tige goede freonen wurden.
But this is us.	Mar dit binne wy.
That's it really.	Dat is it echt.
The truth has nothing to do with it.	De wierheid hat der neat mei te krijen.
You said we've never met.	Jo seine dat wy noch noait moete hawwe.
It was not a little good.	It wie net in bytsje goed.
I can not tell you where they keep him.	Ik kin jo net sizze wêr't se him hâlde.
Tell me another one, though.	Fertel my noch ien, doch.
It's like a movie.	It is as in film.
I was not afraid.	Ik wie net bang.
None of the children worked.	Gjin fan 'e bern wurke.
Just like life, nothing is certain.	Krekt as it libben is neat wis.
She could see through me better than anyone else.	Se koe troch my hinne sjen better as immen oars.
You've been making this movie on and off for three years now.	Jo hawwe dizze film al trije jier oan en út makke.
That will not happen in two years.	Dat bart net oer twa jier.
He will, of course, do well in everything.	Hy sil fansels yn alles goed dwaan.
If you want to talk to me, talk to me.	As jo ​​​​mei my prate wolle, praat dan mei my.
If you're in there.	As jo ​​dêr yn binne.
It was his money.	It wie syn jild.
I know that's something.	Ik wit dat dat wat is.
He saw us but went on.	Hy seach ús mar gie troch.
No one should actually be surprised.	Nimmen soe eins ferrast wêze moatten.
That was why.	Dat wie wêrom.
A friend of mine told me about it a few years ago.	In freon fan my fertelde my der in pear jier lyn oer.
That's what you saw.	Dat hawwe jo sjoen.
I think we had.	Ik tink dat wy hiene.
Do not think about this.	Tink net oer dit.
You have to want to do it for hours and hours.	Jo moatte it oeren en oeren dwaan wolle.
We take on many life times.	Wy nimme op in protte libben kear.
She looked very, very, very tired.	Se seach der hiel, hiel, hiel wurch út.
I knew she would not let me.	Ik wist dat se my net litte soe.
This is her bed.	Dit is har bêd.
It's about everything.	It giet oer alles.
It was not as if they would let anyone down.	It wie net oft se der elkenien oan litte soene.
We just.	Wy gewoan.
But there was no time.	Mar der wie gjin tiid.
It was not too much.	It wie net te folle.
I can not buy this.	Ik kin dit net keapje.
I think it was real.	Ik tink dat it echt wie.
I'm scared of him.	Ik bin bang foar him.
We still have a way to go.	Wy hawwe noch in wei te gean.
I just had a bad day.	Ik hie gewoan in minne dei.
You have everything you need.	Jo hawwe alles wat jo nedich hawwe.
Or not going to the movie.	Of net nei de film gean.
That we will give them a chance.	Dat wy sille har in kâns jaan.
That's good.	Dat is goed.
I said.	sei ik.
That was clear.	Dat wie dúdlik.
You find them.	Jo fine se.
Not the truth.	Net de wierheid.
He wanted it.	Hy woe it wol.
she says.	seit se.
He often ate food with his family.	Hy iet faak iten mei syn famylje.
She is something else.	Se is wat oars.
I give it up.	Ik jou it op.
No one knows how much.	Nimmen wit hoefolle.
Didn't have to say anything to my wife.	Moast neat tsjin myn frou sizze.
I must have seen one or both before.	Ik moat ien of beide earder sjoen hawwe.
Do not worry, it's nothing.	Sit gjin soargen, it is neat.
That made us think we might need to talk to her more.	Dat liet ús tinke dat wy miskien mear mei har prate moatte.
Now she did not know what to think.	No wist se net wat se tinke moast.
I never wanted children.	Ik ha noait bern woe.
Will leave some money on, she said.	Sil der wat jild oan litte, sei se.
He's not doing it yet.	Hy docht it noch net.
You can of course do this when you go.	Jo kinne dit fansels dwaan as jo gean.
I was different.	Ik wie oars.
We would love to see them!	Wy wolle se graach sjen!
Never found her again.	Nea fûn se wer.
Not out of here, not in this place.	Net út hjir, net op dit plak.
But we are not that people.	Mar wy binne net dat minsken.
No one has seen it for what it is.	Nimmen hat it sjoen foar wat it is.
But nothing happened.	Mar der barde neat.
They too will be gone so soon.	Ek se sille sa gau fuort wêze.
I think it's sitting in the water here.	Ik tink dat it hjir yn it wetter sit.
Then a girl from another school comes and you are interested.	Dan komt der in famke fan in oare skoalle en do bist ynteressearre.
They were ready.	Se wiene klear.
We want him there, and we think it would be fun.	Wy wolle him dêr, en wy tinke dat it soe wêze leuk.
I can not do that.	Dat kin ik net dwaan.
He was her husband.	Hy wie har man.
Of course, he had nothing to do with it.	Hy hie der fansels hielendal neat oan.
There you have him.	Dêr hast him.
But it will also not do any good.	Mar it sil ek gjin goed dwaan.
But no one wanted to go.	Mar nimmen woe gean.
But every day she talks.	Mar alle dagen praat se.
You will not go wrong.	Jo sille net ferkeard gean.
If there was a house, it would have been here.	As der in hûs wie, hie it hjir west.
Do not talk.	Net prate.
He looked at her.	Hy seach har oan.
It's just, we have no idea how.	It is gewoan, wy hawwe gjin idee hoe.
Their whole lives, things have been one way.	Har hiele libben, dingen west hawwe ien manier.
No child would say that.	Gjin bern soe dat sizze.
It was not to be this time.	It wie dizze kear net te wêzen.
That person has never been seen again.	Dy persoan is nea wer sjoen.
They are still.	Se binne noch.
He did not expect that.	Dat hie er net ferwachte.
Well, you do not need my help.	No, jo hawwe myn help net nedich.
We can try.	Wy kinne besykje.
I do not see it.	Ik sjoch it net.
Never tell anyone what you should not have.	Fertel noait ien wat jo net hoege te hawwen.
I do not think so.	Ik tink net.
I have everything in here.	Ik haw hjir alles yn.
That felt good.	Dat fielde goed.
And it really works.	En it wurket echt.
I have a lot to tell you.	Ik haw jo in protte te fertellen.
Two things happened after all.	Twa dingen binne nei alle gedachten bard.
Or maybe it was from her.	Of miskien wie it fan har.
Everyone says they are really fun.	Elkenien seit dat se echt leuk binne.
She did not know how long she had been away.	Se wist net hoe lang se fuort west hie.
We've talked about this before.	Wy hawwe it hjir al earder oer hân.
That's exactly what you seem to be doing.	Dat is krekt wat jo lykje te dwaan.
How could this happen.	Hoe koe dit barre.
They have no time to talk.	Se hawwe gjin tiid om te praten.
And if you want to be.	En as jo wolle wêze.
I do not like it a bit.	Ik hâld der net in bytsje fan.
Quite simply, you are wrong.	Hiel gewoan, jo binne ferkeard.
He would not be the same either.	Hy soe ek net deselde wêze.
I have nothing left in this life.	Ik haw neat mear yn dit libben.
They obviously said nothing.	Se hawwe fansels neat sein.
That's what they'll get here.	Dat sille se hjir krije.
I do not know for sure that mine.	Ik wit net foar wis dat myn.
Know where he was.	Wit wêr't hy wie.
They go hand in hand.	Se geane hân en hân.
He did not do any of those things.	Hy die net ien fan dy dingen.
Work out the following problem.	Wurkje it folgjende probleem út.
Her mother would never have kept it.	Har mem soe it nea hâlden hawwe.
She just went home, not away.	Se gie gewoan nei hûs, net fuort.
It works or does not work.	It wurket of wurket net.
I love it.	Ik hâld der fan.
But would if she could.	Mar soe as se koe.
He is with two under.	Hy is mei twa ûnder.
If it happens, then.	As it bart, dan.
Their meeting was for.	Har gearkomste wie foar.
His wife's house.	It hûs fan syn frou.
None of it is true.	Gjin fan it is wier.
No one said the big time was easy.	Nimmen sei dat de grutte tiid maklik wie.
I did it just to be different.	Ik die it allinnich om oars te wêzen.
It's what you want.	It is wat jo wolle.
She was in a better place.	Se wie op in better plak.
Again she did nothing.	Wer die se neat.
Look at that.	Sjoch der nei.
It's still what we do to this day.	It is noch wat wy dogge oant hjoed de dei.
I know he has one.	Ik wit dat hy ien hat.
They can have it.	Se kinne it hawwe.
I have no time.	Ik haw gjin tiid.
For the first time in my life, the work was hard.	Foar it earst yn myn libben wie it wurk hurd.
Everyone there found it a good idea.	Elkenien dêr fûn it in goed idee.
She was with her family.	Se wie mei har famylje.
He was there again.	Hy wie der wer by.
I love the movie, and so do my kids.	Ik hâld fan de film, en dat dogge myn bern ek.
There are only about thirty left.	Der binne noch mar sa'n tritich oer.
And we are not.	En wy binne net.
You're ready.	Do bist klear.
Look at my father.	Sjoch nei myn heit.
Then he looks at me.	Dan sjocht er my oan.
I could not see the way.	Ik koe de wei net sjen.
But he did nothing.	Mar hy die neat.
She would have been scared.	Se soe bang west hawwe.
Otherwise she would not.	Oars soe se net.
But it has never, ever been true.	Mar it hat noait, ea wier west.
Dad seemed too busy to me.	Heit like my folle te drok.
It was real.	It wie echt.
I just need to talk to you.	Ik moat gewoan mei dy prate.
He did not come out.	Hy kaam net út.
He wanted to leave.	Hy woe fuort.
Maybe there is nothing.	Miskien is der neat.
Well, it's good there.	No, it is der goed.
He let it go for too bad.	Hy liet it foar te min gean.
Will you help ?.	Sille jo helpe?.
This was not what she was talking about.	Dit wie net wat se praat oer.
Nothing that.	Neat dat.
I will not tell you again.	Ik sil it dy net wer fertelle.
We must do what is necessary.	Wy moatte dwaan wat nedich is.
It's not about me, it's about him.	It giet net om my, it giet oer him.
That song they knew well.	Dat liet koene se goed.
In this life.	Yn dit libben.
This is actually wrong.	Dit is eins ferkeard.
A woman who talks like that.	In frou dy't sa praat.
Do the latter before doing the first.	Doch it lêste, foardat jo it earste dogge.
I have to go home.	Ik moat thús.
But you should not if you do not want to.	Mar jo moatte net as jo net wolle.
These are what they always were.	Dit binne wat se altyd wiene.
And that probably does it no good.	En dat docht it wierskynlik net goed.
He has to pay for his hair.	Hy moat syn hier betelje.
But for now.	Mar foar no.
He was tired, for one thing.	Hy wie wurch, foar ien ding.
I give her money every day.	Ik jou har jild alle dagen.
She said nothing for a long time.	Se sei lang neat.
I was trying to figure out what had happened.	Ik besocht út te finen wat der bard is.
The, the house.	De, it hûs.
Look up is.	Sjoch op is.
They will be soon.	Se sille gau wêze.
Watch the movie.	Sjoch de film.
He was everything my mother wanted.	Hy wie alles wat myn mem woe.
I'm feeling better now, just tired.	It giet my no better, gewoan wurch.
I'll buy you a new one.	Ik sil dy in nije keapje.
Two of the three will likely.	Twa fan de trije sille wierskynlik.
She is always.	Se is altyd.
But it does not work.	Mar it wurket net.
I could never find him again.	Ik koe him nea wer fine.
I think it could be something else.	Ik tink dat it wat oars kin.
This was different than just working hard.	Dit wie oars as gewoan hurd wurkje.
You're very nice.	Do bist hiel aardich.
We're waiting.	Wy wachtsje.
If nothing is done, we will not have enough food.	As der neat dien wurdt, hawwe wy net genôch iten.
We'll be back this evening.	Wy komme dizze jûn werom.
So they just don’t talk, she said.	Sa prate se gewoan net, sei se.
She had done enough for herself.	Dêr hie se sels genôch oan dien.
He did not seem too worried.	Hy like net al te soargen.
She was not yet ready to leave.	Se wie noch net ree om fuort te gean.
He does not worry a little about such things.	Hy makket him net in bytsje soargen oer dat soarte dingen.
He knew this day would come and now it's here.	Hy wist dat dizze dei komme soe en no is it hjir.
It was time to see her family and friends.	It wie tiid om har famylje en freonen te sjen.
You have done enough.	Jo hawwe genôch dien.
And maybe we'll get another chance there.	En miskien krije wy dêr noch in kâns.
That's open again.	Die se wer iepen.
It had to happen.	It moast barre.
She could not do much better than that.	Se koe net folle better as dat.
I'm back to work too.	Ik bin ek werom oan it wurk.
You will stay here.	Jo sille hjir bliuwe.
You do not have to keep them.	Jo hoege se net te hâlden.
There's just one of those.	D'r is mar ien fan dy.
There really is something for everyone.	Der is echt wat foar elkenien.
That was clear.	Dat wie dúdlik.
I'll just give you one chance.	Ik sil dy mar ien kâns jaan.
A car to drive.	In auto om te riden.
When you get to.	As jo ​​krije by.
Tell me this is not true.	Fertel my dat dit net wier is.
And we do not find it.	En wy fine it net.
We had them there yesterday.	Wy hiene se der juster.
She was not alone this time.	Se wie dizze kear net allinnich.
Not too much, but a little.	Net te folle, mar in bytsje.
It would not be easy.	Dit soe net maklik wurde.
I keep it out.	Ik hâld it út.
But, this was not yet clear to everyone.	Mar, dit wie noch net foar allegear dúdlik.
I know it's hard.	Ik wit dat it dreech is.
Now people too.	No ek minsken.
He was.	Hy wie.
But it was not so, was it, it was not so.	Mar it wie net sa, wie it, it wie net sa.
And you know it when you find it.	En jo witte it as jo it fine.
Here's the man.	Hjir is de man.
Nobody can do that.	Nimmen kin dat dwaan.
It's easy to see why this happened.	It is maklik om te sjen wêrom't dit bard is.
He seemed to speak more against himself than against anyone there.	Hy like mear tsjin himsels te praten as tsjin immen dêr.
Feel it open to me.	Fiel it my iepen.
There was no good reason anymore to buy them.	Der wie gjin goede reden mear om se te keapjen.
And if he had not seen her.	En as er har net sjoen hie.
Give the child a better life and all that.	Jou it bern in better libben en dat alles.
But we can only do this if we know.	Mar wy kinne dit allinnich dwaan as wy witte.
Where are they going?	Wer geane se hinne?
What she was in a way.	Wat se op in manier wie.
The family became one.	De famylje waard ien.
There's a little life left in him.	Der sit in bytsje libben yn him oer.
Well, it was so.	No, it wie sa.
If you want to go, go now.	As jo ​​gean wolle, gean no.
I've never seen it.	Ik haw it noait sjoen.
And they believe it is something else.	En se leauwe dat it wat oars is.
And the two do not have to go together.	En de twa hoege net tegearre te gean.
You told us.	Jo hawwe it ús ferteld.
She did not want to look away from the man.	Se woe net fan de man ôf sjen.
My dad did this to me for about an hour.	Myn heit hat my dit sa'n oere dien.
It is an open book.	It is in iepen boek.
But could not really her.	Mar koe har net echt.
It looked so good.	It seach der sa goed út.
He makes the plan.	Hy makket it plan.
Let no one else speak for you.	Lit gjinien oars foar jo prate.
Where there are big problems.	Wêr't grutte problemen binne.
We would have to go through the city to get there.	Wy soene troch de stêd moatte om dêr te kommen.
She wanted him.	Se woe him.
They turned it on and hoped it would help.	Se sette it oan en hope dat it soe helpe.
Then we do something else.	Dan dogge wy wat oars.
Maybe he stayed a year back.	Miskien bleau er in jier werom.
Everything could be true.	Alles koe wier wêze.
He prepared the food for the feast.	Hy makke it iten foar it feest klear.
But that's it.	Mar dat is it.
Maybe it had been both.	Miskien wie it beide west.
I heard the words even before he said them.	Ik hearde de wurden noch foardat er se sei.
When asked, they said nothing.	By de fraach seine se neat.
He will not go high.	Hy sil net hoege.
I could not leave.	Ik koe net fuort.
This is my room.	Dit is myn keamer.
That was nice though.	Dat wie wol aardich.
I was sick for two years.	Ik wie twa jier siik.
Go away, he says.	Gean fuort, seit er.
I indicated that it should stop.	Ik joech oan dat it ophâlde moast.
But no one there.	Mar gjinien dêr.
I'm the only one here.	Ik bin de ienige hjir.
They were just kids.	Se wiene gewoan bern.
I'm the good person.	Ik bin de goede persoan.
I want him.	Ik wol him wol.
We have a way to go.	Wy hawwe in manier om te gean.
There were three.	Der wiene trije.
All the time, 'he said.	De hiele tiid,' sei er.
I'm a little tired.	Ik bin in bytsje wurch.
Really good movie.	Echt goede film.
You must have heard.	Jo moatte hawwe heard.
And I.	En ik.
They just can’t leave well enough alone.	Se kinne gewoan net goed genôch allinnich litte.
The truth is.	De wierheid is .
This will make you happy.	Dit sil jo bliid meitsje.
I have only one question.	Ik haw mar ien fraach.
They're coming back.	Se komme werom.
A girl entered the room.	In famke kaam de keamer yn.
I asked what it was.	Ik frege wat it wie.
I had seen nothing.	Ik hie neat sjoen.
If she was not there, he would not come.	As se der net wie, soe er har net komme.
He will take care of it.	Hy sil der wol foar soargje.
It's your hand.	It is dyn hân.
Look at the picture.	Sjoch nei de foto.
It's the first time it's shown.	It is de earste kear dat te sjen is.
So much came out of him.	Der kaam safolle út him te kommen.
But not enough.	Mar net genôch.
It's not as difficult as it seems.	It is net sa dreech as it liket.
I thought we were going.	Ik tocht dat wy geane.
But it's much better.	Mar it is folle better.
Sick, but not too sick.	Siik, mar net te siik.
You are my wife, not his.	Do bist myn frou, net syn.
It's long gone.	It is al lang fuort.
I wondered why he had asked me.	Ik frege my ôf wêrom't er my frege hie.
You could not help it.	Jo koene it net helpe.
And so it was with this one.	En sa wie it mei dizze.
I would say.	Ik soe sizze.
I can not say whether this is so.	Ik kin net sizze oft dit sa is.
I bought him.	Ik kocht him.
I can not do that.	Dat kin ik net.
That's exactly what we did.	Dat diene wy ​​krekt.
Maybe more than a few.	Miskien mear as in pear.
He did not like that.	Hy mocht dat net leuk fine.
We realized we both liked the same thing.	Wy realisearre dat wy beide like itselde ding.
She took my husband.	Se naam myn man.
They will not say they know.	Se sille net sizze dat se witte.
Or should have known.	Of hie it witte moatten.
She felt her min.	Se fielde har min.
I have to go to bed.	Ik moat op bêd.
I read the whole thing.	Ik haw it hiele ding lêzen.
Or just to talk.	Of gewoan om te praten.
They worked hard to finish the job on time.	Se wurke hurd om it wurk op 'e tiid ôf te meitsjen.
Sure, this guy would help.	Wis, dizze man soe helpe.
And he wanted her with him.	En hy woe har by him.
Now they will be able to see clearly.	No sille se dúdlik sjen kinne.
But not in the way you might think.	Mar net op 'e manier dy't jo miskien tinke.
That's as much as you need to know.	Dat is safolle as jo witte moatte.
That problem is not for us.	Dat probleem is net foar ús.
We must not be too hard.	Wy moatte net te hurd wêze.
He started at once.	Hy begûn yn ien kear.
We are, really.	Wy binne, echt.
I'm back there.	Ik bin der wer by.
I'm afraid of what might happen.	Ik bin bang foar wat der komme kin.
He showed us his new car.	Hy liet ús syn nije auto sjen.
You do not think clearly.	Jo tinke net dúdlik.
Come on people.	Kom op minsken.
He had found nothing.	Hy hie neat fûn.
And this is your city.	En dit is dyn stêd.
You will come to life.	Jo sille komme ta libben.
Tell me about your mother.	Fertel my oer dyn mem.
Better not, better not.	Better net, better net.
I tried to walk away.	Ik besocht fuort te gean.
I can take him.	Ik kin him nimme.
They are hard but good for the kids.	Se binne hurd, mar goed foar de bern.
This issue is still open.	Dit probleem is noch iepen.
That's what we're for.	Dat is wêr't wy foar komme.
Well, it is not.	No, it is net.
I do not think we can afford it.	Ik tink net dat wy it betelje kinne.
I would not let him eat that day anymore.	Ik soe him dy dei net mear ite litte.
She is not like other children.	Se is net as oare bern.
But a few things.	Mar in pear dingen.
They will do whatever it takes.	Se sille dwaan wat it nedich is.
He can, or can not.	Hy kin, of kin net.
There was nothing more to say.	Der wie net mear te sizzen.
It looked like a house.	It like in hûs.
They talk him and us out of there.	Se prate him en ús der út.
The first is a man.	De earste is in man.
He wanted to work harder.	Hy woe mear wurkje.
I'm not convinced of that.	Ik bin der neat fan oertsjûge.
He took my hand.	Hy naam myn hân.
My mother has always been my best friend.	Myn mem hat altyd myn bêste freon west.
And there were parents.	En der wiene âlden.
Even if she did become more interested, nothing could happen.	Sels as se wol mear ynteressearre waard, koe der neat barre.
Done with it.	Dien mei it.
They just do their job and do it well.	Se dogge gewoan har wurk en dogge it goed.
Never enter the room.	Nea komt de keamer yn.
I asked him if it was from him.	Ik frege him oft it fan him wie.
She had nothing to do with it.	Se hie der neat oan.
I can no longer.	Ik kin net mear.
That's good.	Dat is goed.
A few more questions.	Noch in pear fragen.
I want her to see me.	Ik wol dat se my sjocht.
I hope you like it too.	Ik hoopje dat jo ek wolle.
I guess I was not clear.	Ik tink dat ik net dúdlik wie.
Not that he liked the work.	Net dat er it wurk leuk hie.
Just get in there !.	Kom der mar yn!.
I wanted to see what you were up to.	Ik woe sjen wat jo oan 'e hân wiene.
It was one of the few things that made him happy about me.	It wie ien fan de pear dingen dy't him bliid oer my.
See what they think of me now.	Sjoch wat se no fan my tinke.
He would have to take a hand.	Hy soe in hân nimme moatte.
It was now.	It wie no.
Tonight we'll be watching a movie.	Fan 'e jûn sille wy in film sjen.
You do not know what he is like.	Jo witte net hoe't hy is.
But otherwise he was much the same.	Mar oars wie er folle itselde.
Pay it.	Betelje it.
She was the only woman he wanted.	Se wie de ienige frou dy't er woe.
That's not what this is about.	Dêr giet it hjir net om.
There is so much going on.	Der bart safolle.
There was so little.	Der wie sa'n bytsje.
But we only have one year left.	Mar wy hawwe noch mar ien jier.
We come for you.	Wy komme foar dy.
That he had expected.	Dat hie er ferwachte.
There are no sure things.	Der binne gjin wis dingen.
But first another one.	Mar earst noch ien.
What would that be.	Wat soe dat.
Good by me.	Goed troch my.
Her friends would be home by now.	Har freonen soene no thús wêze.
My teacher is very kind.	Myn learaar is heul aardich.
Hour for hour.	Oere foar oere.
It was his.	It wie syn.
Or like it.	Of like it.
They really need to win at home.	Se moatte echt thús winne.
You can no longer do this.	Jo kinne dit net mear dwaan.
This all works very nicely.	Dit wurket allegear hiel moai.
I felt like a child.	Ik fielde my as in bern.
Leave it to me.	Lit it oan my oer.
I have nothing to do with a book.	Ik haw neat mei in boek.
Fun has to be done.	Leuk moat dien wurde.
He could not do what he had to do below.	Hy koe net dwaan wat er hjir ûnder moast.
Or what we would oppose.	Of wat wy soene op tsjin.
We have resolved these questions.	Wy hawwe dizze fragen besletten.
It remains to be seen.	It is noch te sjen.
My mother does.	Myn mem docht.
Even though I am it.	Ek al bin ik it.
You have this.	Jo hawwe dit.
It's like hard work.	It is as hurd wurk.
He is angry at himself when he has done wrong.	Hy is lilk op himsels as er ferkeard dien hat.
I'm thinking about this.	Ik tink hjir oer.
I was not even sure what to say.	Ik wie net iens wis wat te sizzen.
The boy will not talk about what happened.	De jonge sil net prate oer wat der bard is.
You must not go and give me away.	Jo moatte net gean en jou my fuort.
I know we did not do it.	Ik wit dat wy it net dien hawwe.
I go myself.	Ik gean sels.
He had no plan.	Hy hie gjin plan.
But her husband did not want to leave her.	Mar har man woe har net litte.
He admitted that much was true.	Hy joech ta dat in protte wier wie.
Well, one die.	No, ien die.
I want to do something, be someone.	Ik wol wat dwaan, immen wêze.
I do not stand much chance.	Ik meitsje net folle kâns.
But it does not now.	Mar it docht no net.
We did nothing wrong.	Wy hawwe neat ferkeard dien.
That must be the name of an animal!	Dat moat de namme fan in bist wêze!
People are angry.	Minsken binne lilk.
And that is them.	En dat binne se.
Okay, here we go.	Goed, hjir geane wy.
He looked around in his mind.	Hy seach yn syn gedachten om.
Time to wake up.	Tiid om wekker te wurden.
That they think they know everything.	Dat se tinke dat se alles witte.
I have to look into it.	Ik moat der nei sjen.
That's what you need to show in your question.	Dat is wat jo moatte sjen litte yn jo fraach.
Just a little more.	Krekt in bytsje mear.
Last night was really no different.	Fannacht wie echt net oars.
It's your job.	It is dyn wurk.
A better one too.	In bettere ek.
If it was, it's coming back.	As it wie, komt it werom.
You would never think of it, but it does.	Jo soene it noait tinke, mar it docht it.
By many things.	Troch in protte dingen.
I can not say it enough.	Ik kin it net genôch sizze.
Life was not too easy now and the last time.	It libben wie no net al te maklik en de lêste tiid.
It's been like this for over a year.	It is al mear as in jier sa.
My life, his life.	Myn libben, syn libben.
But that was the first.	Mar dat wie de earste.
There may have been.	Der kin west hawwe.
I believe that is true, for better or worse.	Ik leau dat dat wier is, foar goed of min.
This should not be done by children.	Dit moat net dien wurde troch bern.
Show people that we are together.	Lit minsken sjen dat wy tegearre binne.
It only has to be true.	It moat allinnich wier wêze.
That's kind of it for this week.	Dat is sa'n bytsje it foar dizze wike.
We just know it.	Wy witte it gewoan.
Maybe you can help.	Miskien kinne jo helpe.
Good for them we say.	Goed foar har sizze wy.
The last died there.	De lêste stoar dêr.
He seemed tired and weary.	Hy like wurch en wurch.
It totally works for this kind of book.	It wurket hielendal foar dit soarte fan boek.
They knew that.	Dat wisten se.
This is simply not necessary.	Dit is gewoan net nedich.
Then you make it happen.	Dan meitsje jo it barre.
Do not worry about me.	Gean jo net soargen oer my.
She knew that door.	Se koe dy doar.
Not a new man.	Net in nije man.
Maybe my idea is just bad.	Miskien is myn idee gewoan min.
She told me he loved her more than anything.	Se fertelde my dat hy mear fan har hâlde as wat dan ek.
It's in the house.	It is yn 'e hûs.
He stayed only one day.	Hy bleau mar ien dei.
There was no one in the room.	Der wie gjinien yn 'e keamer.
Maybe we had it well, once upon a time.	Miskien hiene wy ​​it wol, eartiids.
You know it, they know it.	Jo witte it, se witte it.
I think he did a bad thing.	Ik tink dat hy in minne ding dien hat.
Of course she would.	Fansels soe se.
I put them to work.	Ik sette se oan it wurk.
But this year is something different.	Mar dit jier is wat oars.
That's still here.	Dat is hjir noch dêr.
That must have been hard.	Dat moat hurd west hawwe.
He just could not.	Hy koe gewoan net.
He loves her.	Hy hâldt fan har.
You will find it.	Jo sille it fine.
This is not nice, but works well.	Dit is net moai, mar wurket goed.
Should we do it or should we not.	Moatte wy it dwaan of moatte wy net.
I'm just happy to be with you.	Ik bin gewoan bliid mei dy te wêzen.
But why do you do it this way?	Mar wêrom dogge jo dizze manier?
It's just something.	It is gewoan wat.
One day they would take her too.	Op in dei soene se har ek nimme.
Would not know.	Soe it net witte.
Twice a week.	Twa kear yn de wike.
I know it sounds like that, but it's not true.	Ik wit dat it sa liket, mar it is net wier.
My family was my mother and I.	Myn famylje wie myn mem en ik.
I just could not believe it.	Ik koe it gewoan net leauwe.
And so do we.	En dat dogge wy ek.
We just had too little time.	Wy hiene krekt te min tiid.
More than anything.	Mear as wat dan ek.
So anyway, over my weekend.	Sa hoe dan ek, oer myn wykein.
That had something to do with it.	Dat hie der wol wat mei te krijen.
And no one will have to tell me.	En nimmen sil it my fertelle moatte.
He had no money with him.	Hy hie gjin jild by him.
She would not let it happen.	Se soe it net barre litte.
But then good things happen often.	Mar dan binne goede dingen faak.
He was under water for so long.	Hy wie sa lang ûnder wetter.
My father has returned.	Myn heit is werom kommen.
I did not go with anyone.	Ik gie mei net ien.
There is only one way to find out.	D'r is mar ien manier om út te finen.
I'm happy for these things.	Ik bin bliid foar dizze dingen.
I did not get it.	Ik krige it net.
The place came to life.	It plak kaam ta libben.
I tried this.	Ik besocht dit.
The boy said he wished he could.	De jonge sei dat er woe dat er koe.
Of course a better life.	Fansels in better libben.
But it's too late to go back now.	Mar it is no te let om werom te gean.
I could not let him go.	Ik koe him net litte litte.
Not exactly those things.	Net krekt dy dingen.
I see you love things about me.	Ik sjoch dat jo dingen fan my hâlde.
She looked surprised.	Se seach ferrast.
I wonder if they make something for you.	Ik freegje my ôf oft se wat foar jo meitsje.
I sympathize with you.	Ik fiel mei dy mei.
They may not be left alone.	Se mei net allinnich litte.
It's for the best.	It is foar it bêste.
That house looks old.	Dat hûs liket âld.
Here we will look at two of these.	Hjir sille wy nei twa fan dizze sjen.
He looks on.	Hy sjocht nei.
That's right, water.	Dat is krekt, wetter.
We have no idea what.	Wy hawwe gjin idee wat.
There is nothing more for me to do.	Der is neat mear foar my te dwaan.
But today is the day.	Mar hjoed is de dei.
Now it goes on and on and on.	No giet it troch en troch en troch.
I think you have a problem.	Ik tink dat jo in probleem hawwe.
Never been, never will be.	Nea west, sil nea wêze.
You would not eat.	Jo soene net ite.
That was the last thing he said.	Dat wie it lêste wat er sei.
Not everyone, exactly.	Net elkenien, krekt.
We're going for it.	Wy geane der foar.
Food and more food.	Iten en mear iten.
I do not know why this should be so.	Ik wit net wêrom dit sa moat.
That, we have a lot of problems.	Dat, wy hawwe in protte problemen.
Says he just can not.	Seit dat hy it gewoan net kin.
Take a picture if you want.	Nim in foto as jo wolle.
He is nothing more.	Hy is neat mear.
That's where we are today.	Dat is wêr't wy hjoed binne.
Still can not believe it.	Noch altyd kin it net leauwe.
And without that.	En sûnder dat.
I wake up early every day.	Ik wurd alle dagen betiid wekker.
He works as a teacher.	Hy wurket as learaar.
I have no idea why.	Ik ha gjin idee wêrom.
He wanted to come to them, not them to come to him.	Hy woe by har komme, net se by him komme.
I do not want this to be just another.	Ik wol net dat dit gewoan in oare is.
I'll come to you.	Ik sil by dy komme.
She knows him too well.	Se ken him te goed.
The only person he could.	De ienige persoan dy't hy koe.
Tell us more about it.	Fertel ús der mear oer.
He was still the man.	Hy wie noch de man.
Buy what you need, then come back.	Keapje wat jo nedich binne, kom dan werom.
You're a man.	Do bist in man.
I can not think of anything.	Ik kin net tinke wat.
Well, let's go.	No, litte wy gean.
They just have it.	Se hawwe it gewoan.
You never get away with it.	Jo komme der noait mei fuort.
Without me you are nothing.	Sûnder my bist neat.
We have them exactly where we want them.	Wy hawwe se krekt wêr't wy se wolle.
Buy as much food as you can.	Keapje safolle iten as jo kinne.
She walked to the open door.	Se rûn nei de iepen doar.
I want more out.	Ik wol mear út.
It was really not hard to figure out.	It wie echt net dreech om út te finen.
She had met a man, she said.	Se hie in man moete, sei se.
We are here and we have a job to do.	Wy binne hjir en wy hawwe in baan te dwaan.
All right, she thought.	Goed, tocht se.
He looks pretty angry.	Hy liket aardich lilk.
There was nothing out of place.	D'r wie neat fan plak.
Would you like to come sooner.	Wolle jo earder komme.
It's a problem.	It is in probleem.
He liked that though.	Hy like dat wol.
Tell him exactly the same thing.	Fertel him krekt itselde ding.
We will never know for sure now.	Wy sille it no noait wis witte.
Even her husband's life.	Sels it libben fan har man.
This was a problem.	Dit wie in probleem.
But as soon as the door is open, nothing can be seen.	Mar sa gau as de doar út is, kin neat sjen.
He's just the best.	Hy is gewoan de bêste.
He felt better this morning.	Hy fielde him fan 'e moarn better.
Do not come back.	Kom net werom.
I love seeing you out and about.	Ik hâld fan dy te sjen út en oer.
We can not stay.	Wy kinne net bliuwe.
Her word was her word.	Har wurd wie har wurd.
It could be one of them.	It koe ien fan har wêze.
Over and over, year after year, bit by bit.	Oer en oer, jier op jier, bytsje by bytsje.
Of course it worked.	Fansels wurke it.
Maybe the child is with her.	Miskien is it bern by har.
I do not want to see him again.	Ik wol him net wer sjen.
But this is how it was.	Mar dit is hoe't it wie.
I work here alone.	Ik wurkje hjir allinnich.
But nothing came of the idea.	Mar der kaam neat fan it idee.
I'm sorry for you.	It spyt my foar dy.
But she saw it now herself.	Mar se seach it no sels.
Well, long gone.	No, lang fuort.
To get to work.	Om oan it wurk te gean.
You do not have to say it.	Jo hoege it net te sizzen.
I'm sure you know about it.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo witte oer it.
I have it all.	Ik haw dat alles.
Just do what you want.	Doch gewoan wat jo wolle.
And it's good if you know it.	En it is goed as jo it witte.
They could look back.	Se koene werom sjen.
She works hard for her money.	Se wurket hurd foar har jild.
I know it.	Ik wit it.
He will not talk about it.	Hy sil der net oer prate.
So many are not there.	Safolle binne der net.
And he would give it to her.	En hy soe it har jaan.
I can not look at these people and not see them.	Ik kin net nei dizze minsken sjen en se net sjen.
The time was up.	De tiid wie derop.
So you have to show it.	Dat jo moatte it sjen litte.
It is for this reason that we are opposed.	It is om dizze reden dat wy tsjin binne.
I need a room.	Ik ha in keamer nedich.
We should not be afraid.	Wy moatte net bang wêze.
She was ready to go.	Se wie ree om te gean.
A movie was made.	Der waard in film makke.
All good so far.	Alles goed oant no ta.
I kind of.	Ik soarte fan.
Is there another way to do this.	Is der in oare manier om dit te dwaan.
The water is coming.	It wetter komt.
But tell me what you think !.	Mar fertel my wat jo tinke!.
He would become something.	Hy soe wat wurde.
They do so quickly.	Dat dogge se gau.
Not only them.	Net allinnich se.
That's my best so far.	Dat is myn bêste oant no ta.
It's for him.	It is foar him.
It is very easy to do.	It is hiel maklik om te dwaan.
The question is difficult.	De fraach is dreech.
I took her hand.	Ik naam har hân.
Be like water.	Wês as wetter.
I thought you might want to know.	Ik tocht dat jo it witte wolle.
Nobody eats now.	Gjinien yt no.
We hope to make some money from this.	Wy hoopje hjir wat jild fan te meitsjen.
And you should be too.	En jo moatte ek wêze.
He had been busy.	Hy hie it drok west.
I saw them earlier.	Ik seach se earder.
That's all there's.	Dat is alles wat der is.
I feel like it does.	Ik fiel dat it docht.
Where did she come from?	Wêr kaam se wei?
Anyone to help us get the idea.	Elkenien om ús te helpen it idee te krijen.
The time was yours, in life.	De tiid wie dyn, yn it libben.
And it's not good.	En it is net goed.
I wish you were a girl.	Ik winskje dat jo in famke wiene.
She's not up to it anymore.	Se giet der net mear op.
There is no clear right or wrong here.	D'r is hjir gjin dúdlik goed of ferkeard.
If you're really interested, let me know.	As jo ​​echt ynteressearre, lit my witte.
It's her way.	It is har manier.
I hope you like them.	Ik hoopje dat jo se leuk fine.
She had seen them last night too.	Se hie se fannacht ek sjoen.
We will probably wait a long time.	Wy sille wierskynlik lang wachtsje.
They were already at the party.	Se wiene al oan it feest.
In me.	Yn my.
Could it have been her? 	Koe it har west hawwe?
He thought things through.	Hy tocht de dingen troch.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
It's true.	It is wier.
It was a good book.	It wie in goed boek.
Was not clear about that.	Wie dêr net dúdlik oer.
I had not thought of that.	Ik hie der net oan tocht.
They were just there, ready to watch.	Se wiene der gewoan, klear om nei te sjen.
He wanted to show us something, he said.	Hy woe ús wat sjen litte, sei er.
Or a better life.	Of in better libben.
I never thought we would become friends too.	Ik hie noait tocht dat wy ek freonen wurde soene.
But there is much more to it.	Mar der sit noch folle mear oan.
You need to do it better.	Jo moatte it better dwaan.
He should be angry.	Hy soe lilk wêze moatte.
Everyone seems to be talking about that time.	Elkenien liket te praten oer dy tiid.
Have family there.	Hawwe famylje dêr.
Now she knew this would not happen.	No wist se dat dit net barre soe.
Right here and away.	Krekt hjir en fuort.
I can not really talk now.	Ik kin no net echt prate.
I actually liked it.	Ik fûn it eins leuk.
Or you can just try it yourself.	Of jo kinne it gewoan sels besykje.
And why do people do it.	En wêrom dogge minsken it.
Boy, are you good at it?	Jonge, bist dêr goed yn.
People are busy.	Minsken binne drok.
We're still working it out.	Wy wurkje it noch út.
She told him.	Se fertelde him.
See how you like it.	Sjoch hoe't jo wolle.
There is nothing for you here.	Der is neat foar dy hjir.
Maybe a few here and there.	Miskien in pear hjir en dêr.
The problem is you.	It probleem is dy.
I was not too happy.	Ik wie net te bliid.
Think you were wrong about everything.	Tink dat jo oer alles ferkeard wiene.
He knew what was happening and did nothing.	Hy wist wat der barde en die neat.
Of course not for you.	Fansels net foar dy.
She came back yesterday.	Se kaam juster werom.
We had never met.	Wy hiene nea moete.
I knew there was.	Ik wist dat der wie.
See you soon!.	Oant gau!.
I knew he would not come back.	Ik wist dat hy net werom soe komme.
Children are often angry.	Bern binne faak lilk.
But he was wrong.	Mar hy wie ferkeard.
No bang net.	No bang net.
They would have a plan.	Se soene in plan hawwe.
She says something.	Se seit wat.
It had nothing to do with me.	It hie neat mei my te krijen.
Nobody really knows.	Nimmen wit it echt.
He needed some time for himself.	Hy hie wat tiid foar himsels nedich.
We stay with you, both of us.	Wy bliuwe by dy, ús beide.
I'm sure he would.	Ik bin der wis fan dat hy soe.
You will like them very much.	Jo sille se hiel goed wolle.
I know we should leave you.	Ik wit dat wy dy litte moatte.
You will need to know.	Jo sille moatte witte.
But he does have something of me.	Mar hy hat wol wat fan my.
It was a whole evening.	It wie in hiele jûn.
Please be here.	Wês hjir asjebleaft.
It's you who did it.	It binne jo dy't dat dien hawwe.
We can do this completely !.	Wy kinne dit hielendal dwaan!.
And it was totally good.	En it wie hielendal goed.
He had never seen one before.	Hy hie noch noait ien sjoen.
Never seen her before.	Nea sjoen har foar.
Whether she liked it or not.	Oft se it mocht of net.
You met this man.	Jo moete dizze man.
To me, they were the best.	Foar my wiene se de bêste.
Work hard play hard.	Wurkje hurd spylje hurd.
The time will come when you will have to leave.	De tiid sil komme dat jo fuort moatte.
No one could love her.	Nimmen koe fan har hâlde.
She had looked at him all her life.	Se hie har hiele libben nei him sjoen.
I have my hand.	Ik haw myn hân.
I have no words anymore.	Ik ha gjin wurden mear.
But he was wrong.	Mar hy wie ferkeard.
I'm not as scared of you as that.	Ik bin net sa bang foar dy as dat.
I'm in it almost every day.	Ik bin der hast alle dagen yn.
Father and children.	Heit en bern.
They are something in the next room.	Se binne wat yn 'e folgjende keamer.
Not that he needed to.	Net dat er nedich hie.
I remember him of course from school.	Ik tink him fansels fan skoalle.
This is what makes me happy.	Dit is wat my bliid makket.
Almost time to leave.	Hast tiid om fuort te gean.
I am very happy to be here.	Ik bin hiel bliid hjir te wêzen.
He knew what.	Hy wist wat.
But this can also not be entirely good.	Mar dit kin ek net hielendal goed.
People love new things.	Minsken hâlde fan nije dingen.
I know this is not going to happen.	Ik wit dat dit net sil barre.
But not.	Mar net.
And we are here to help.	En wy binne hjir om te helpen.
It would be good to see you again.	It soe goed wêze dy wer te sjen.
He did everything we needed to do.	Hy die alles wat wy nedich hiene om te dwaan.
For the time being.	Foar no.
That is not a good word.	Dat is gjin goed wurd.
I had to do that on mine.	Ik moast dat dwaan op myn.
Must be made.	Moat makke wurde.
I can not tell it to anyone.	Ik kin it net oan ien fertelle.
She just knows she looks old.	Se wit gewoan dat se âld liket.
Have enough on hand for a month.	Hawwe genôch by de hân foar in moanne.
His mother was very careful with him.	Syn mem wie tige foarsichtich mei him.
Take it back today.	Nim it hjoed wer werom.
We need to get to them.	Wy moatte nei har ta.
Now you will be.	No sille jo wêze.
And that's enough.	En dat is genôch.
Not more than one.	Net mear as ien.
Somehow they were problems.	Op ien of oare manier wiene se problemen.
Reading in bed.	Lêzen op bêd.
What? 	Wat?
She knew what she was saying.	Se wist wat se die.
No one has heard of such a house.	Net ien hat fan sa'n hûs heard.
That I can say.	Dat kin ik sizze.
But he has.	Mar hy hat.
What it was needed.	Wat it nedich wie.
Then hold the next three.	Dan hâlde de folgjende trije.
It could still be one day.	It koe noch wol ien dei.
Today it's gone.	Hjoed is it fuort.
You will see your parents soon.	Jo sille jo âlden gau sjen.
She said so herself.	Dat sei se sels ek.
I gave her everything.	Ik joech har alles.
I just want them at home.	Ik wol se gewoan thús.
I believe it had.	Ik leau dat it hie.
I asked her name.	Ik frege har namme.
That man asked for it.	Dy man frege der om.
Also not my first day at work.	Ek net myn earste dei op it wurk.
You can stay there as long as you want.	Jo kinne dêr bliuwe sa lang as jo wolle.
She has to go herself.	Se moat sels gean.
I pay you.	Ik betelje dy.
I went to my house and my parents were very happy.	Ik gie nei myn hûs en myn âlden wiene tige bliid.
It does not make you a good man or a bad one.	It makket jo net in goede man of in minne.
It's a difficult thing.	It is in dreech ding.
No way to get away.	Gjin manier om fuort te gean.
This is a problem.	Dit is in probleem.
Probably not good.	Wierskynlik net goed.
She did not even try to look at the picture.	Se besocht net iens nei de foto te sjen.
What good comes out of all bad.	Wat goed komt út alle min.
My husband is not here.	Myn man is hjir net.
In fact, that happens a lot of the time.	Eins bart dat in protte fan 'e tiid.
That I saw at once.	Dat seach ik yn ien kear.
I would love more.	Ik soe graach mear.
Think back.	Tink werom.
She had to get out of there.	Se moast der ôf.
No one could doubt it.	Nimmen koe der net oan twifelje.
Now she saw the truth.	No seach se de wierheid.
He was not quite sure why.	Hy wie net hielendal wis wêrom.
This time you hold my hand.	Dy kear hâlde jo myn hân.
That was almost a year ago.	Dat wie hast in jier lyn.
Not just for work, but for everything.	Net allinnich foar wurk, mar foar alles.
I love new things.	Ik hâld fan nije dingen.
He did not agree.	Hy wie it net iens.
I love that you can work.	Ik hâld fan dat jo kinne wurkje.
And she had tried everything.	En se hie alles besocht.
We can even home school our children.	Wy kinne sels thús skoalle ús bern.
She was afraid to shake hands with everyone.	Se wie bang om elkenien de hân te jaan.
Well, he better not have it.	No, hy hie it better net.
It seemed like he wanted to be me, but better.	It like dat er my wêze woe, mar better.
It seems good to me.	It liket my goed.
We have much more to talk about.	Wy hawwe folle mear om oer te praten.
He's a young man.	Hy is in jonge man.
I did not hear you.	Ik hearde dy net.
I just wanted to know what's going on.	Ik woe gewoan witte wat der bart.
It looked like mom and kids had been in trouble.	It like der op dat mem en bern yn de problemen west hiene.
It's not the truth.	It is net de wierheid.
They were not wrong.	Se wiene net ferkeard.
I hope to do it again for sure.	Ik hoopje it wer te dwaan foar wis.
What to find? 	Wat fine?
said my father.	sei myn heit.
Or not enough.	Of net genôch.
We need to do better than this.	Wy moatte it better dwaan as dit.
He has now been two or three times.	Hy hat no twa of trije kear west.
He did not have to see them.	Hy hoegde se net te sjen.
If it does, we have nothing to do.	As it docht, hoege wy neat te dwaan.
Do what he had to do for his family.	Doch wat er dwaan moast foar syn famylje.
We should not have kept those kids after school.	Wy hiene dy bern net nei skoalle hâlde moatten.
I have a lot of time for her.	Ik haw in protte tiid foar har.
We have to doubt.	Wy moatte twifelje.
In the same year.	Yn itselde jier.
Don’t ask why I have to find it, I just do it.	Freegje net wêrom't ik it fine moat, ik doch it gewoan.
There's something wrong with that.	Dêr sit wat oan.
Let be so that and.	Lit wêze sa dat en.
We have no food left.	Wy hawwe gjin iten mear.
In a way, he always was.	Op in manier wie er altyd.
You'll never see me again.	Jo sille my noait wer sjen.
He took it all.	Hy naam it allegear.
Just a pretty long one.	Krekt in moai lang.
This is not clear.	Dit is net dúdlik.
You must be tired.	Jo moatte wurch wêze.
A few days probably.	In pear dagen wierskynlik.
They would get nothing out of them.	Se soene neat út har krije.
And man, did we know we needed each other.	En man, wisten wy dat wy elkoar nedich wiene.
We are the best.	Wy binne de bêste.
This had not been her plan for her life.	Dit hie har plan foar har libben net west.
Well, it's done.	No, it is dien.
That's what we need to do.	Dat moatte wy dwaan.
It does not seem real.	It liket net echt.
And we are like that.	En wy binne sa.
But this meeting would be different.	Mar dizze gearkomste soe oars wêze.
But it's the right thing to do.	Mar it is it goede ding om te dwaan.
If he was.	As hy wie.
Plan something, and if that happens, plan something else.	Plan wat, en as dat wat bart, plan dan wat oars.
Take this bus to town.	Nim dizze bus nei stêd.
Take me home.	Nim my mei nei hûs.
So far nothing is working.	Oant no wurket neat.
We play away once more.	Wy spylje noch ien kear fuort.
Would be.	Soe wêze.
He said not a word.	Hy sei gjin wurd.
I want to know how and why and when.	Ik wol it hoe en it wêrom en it wannear witte.
I would like to know how I can best do this.	Ik wol graach witte hoe't ik dit it bêste dwaan kin.
But this was quite different.	Mar dit wie hielendal oars.
Or it did not say.	Of it woe net sizze.
He will do what is right.	Hy sil dwaan wat goed is.
It would never.	It soe nea.
It looks like you have a really good one.	It liket derop dat jo in echt goede ien hawwe.
Do not agree with this.	Net iens mei dit.
He wants to see you.	Hy wol dy sjen.
It could happen to me.	Dit koe my barre.
She will not hurt you again.	Se sil dy net wer sear dwaan.
Well, that was when it was ready.	No, wie doe't it klear wie.
Better and better.	Better en better.
More, more, he said.	Mear, mear, sei er.
We may need some help now.	Wy kinne no wat help nedich hawwe.
Love this city.	Hâld fan dizze stêd.
I would give my life for it.	Ik soe der myn libben foar jaan.
She had a lot of money now.	Se hie no in protte jild.
That's how you know it's best.	Dat is hoe't jo witte dat it it bêste is.
Please get out of here.	Kom hjir asjebleaft út.
Nobody knew what, nobody had seen her.	Nimmen wist wat, nimmen hie har sjoen.
Maybe it's so.	Miskien is it sa.
My mother can't get enough of it either.	Myn mem kin der ek net genôch fan krije.
I did not want it.	Ik woe it net.
Watch him play this year.	Sjoch him dit jier spylje.
We have no food left.	Wy hawwe gjin iten mear.
I had to tell her.	Ik moast it har fertelle.
The past in the now.	It ferline yn it no.
And he did not want to go back yet.	En hy woe noch net werom.
I did know where they were.	Ik wist wol wêr't se wiene.
He knew his way.	Hy wist syn wei.
I'm never too tired.	Ik bin nea te wurch.
But there you can do things about it.	Mar dêr kinne jo dingen oan dwaan.
And what a boy he was.	En wat wie er in jonge.
And now she knew what they were.	En no wist se wat se wiene.
She looked over at him.	Se seach him oer.
Even better is not to have a being.	Noch better is gjin wêzen te hawwen.
I will not long love you for your work.	Ik sil dy net lang fan dyn wurk hâlde.
There were enough.	Dêr wiene genôch.
You could be something more.	Jo kinne wat mear wêze.
He looked over.	Hy seach oer.
It just goes on and on.	It giet gewoan troch.
Very well done !.	Hiel goed dien!.
You just work for me.	Jo wurkje gewoan foar my.
He was not surprised by the question.	Hy wie net ferrast troch de fraach.
It was a woman he could not.	It wie in frou dy't er net koe.
I think it was at her home.	Ik tink dat it by har thús wie.
Nothing was good.	Neat wie goed.
I just could not get it.	Ik koe it gewoan net krije.
He did a lot of people.	Hy die in protte minsken.
I had done that myself.	Dat hie ik sels ek dien.
It hurt to talk.	It die sear om te praten.
Well, there is.	No, der is.
I'm giving them away.	Ik jou se fuort.
So it just does not work.	Sa wurket it gewoan net.
I show it to people every now and then.	Ik lit it sa no en dan oan minsken sjen.
But he's not really interested.	Mar hy is net echt ynteressearre.
But not the question.	Mar net de fraach.
I liked mine.	Ik mocht fan myn.
Forever.	Foar altyd.
Do it right this time.	Doch it dizze kear goed.
He wanted to get out of the house again.	Hy woe wer út 'e hûs.
But please do not tell my mother.	Mar fertel it myn mem asjebleaft net.
In a year we will get a new car.	Oer in jier krije wy in nije auto.
Why do you need to know?	Wêrom moatte jo witte?
He told me you can say it like that.	Hy fertelde my dat jo it sa kinne sizze.
No one could do it.	Nimmen koe it dwaan.
If there are any problems, the police will come soon.	As der problemen binne, komt de plysje gau.
And to see them.	En om se te sjen.
That all happened for a reason.	Dat alles barde mei in reden.
My mother her mother.	Myn mem har mem.
But we have to.	Mar wy moatte.
It was the same thing.	It wie itselde ding.
Not sure where I'm going wrong.	Net wis wêr't ik ferkeard gean.
His family soon joined him.	Syn famylje kaam him al gau by.
No one is ever where you want him to be.	Nimmen is oait wêr't jo him wolle.
I'm so glad you can help me.	Ik bin sa bliid as jo my kinne helpe.
I knew the truth.	Ik wist de wierheid.
But it's still there.	Mar it is der noch.
I know then what we need to do this evening.	Ik wit dan wat wy dizze jûn dwaan moatte.
That was not even easy to say.	Dat wie net iens maklik sein.
Do that yourself next time.	Doch dat de folgjende kear sels.
Tell us when to come.	Fertel ús wannear te kommen.
I gave her everything back.	Ik joech har alles werom.
No one ever did.	Nimmen die ea.
I just got mine today.	Ik krige myn hjoed krekt.
No one can be sure of that.	Nimmen kin der wis fan wêze.
Now we are here.	No binne wy ​​hjir.
To him it had become clear that she was not interested.	Foar him wie it dúdlik wurden dat se net ynteressearre wie.
He looked back at me.	Hy seach werom nei my.
You have to show him that.	Jo moatte him dat sjen litte.
But he was not angry.	Mar hy wie net lilk.
He is tired.	Hy is wurch.
You need to do two more things.	Jo moatte twa dingen mear dwaan.
It would seem to be in question.	It soe lykje te wêzen yn fraach.
And by that time it will be too late !.	En tsjin dy tiid sil it te let wêze!.
It's hard to look at him.	It is dreech om nei him te sjen.
They do not know that we are coming for them.	Se witte net dat wy foar har komme.
None of the others.	Gjin fan 'e oare.
But people were nice.	Mar minsken wiene aardich.
If there was anything clear, it was.	As der wat dúdlik wie, dan wie dat.
Just let me know if you are interested.	Lit my gewoan witte as jo ynteressearre binne.
Away from me.	Fuort fan my.
But it had been a good party, and he had done well.	Mar it hie in goed feest west, en hy hie it goed dien.
You figure things out.	Jo fine dingen út.
Here's the reason.	Hjir is de reden.
Not just for me.	Net allinnich foar my.
And now this.	En no dit.
I want to be someone.	Ik wol immen wêze.
We'll be back tomorrow.	Wy komme moarn werom.
I'll tell her.	Ik sil it har fertelle.
I know he can.	Ik wit dat hy kin.
He must be a very good friend of mine.	Hy moat in tige goede freon fan my wêze.
Sure, my time had come.	Wis, myn tiid wie kommen.
But you can do them.	Mar jo kinne se dwaan.
I knew it would be so.	Ik wist dat it sa wêze soe.
I will do things from now on.	Ik sil fan no ôf dingen dwaan.
Now is my chance.	No is myn kâns.
There was no one there.	Dêr wie gjinien.
This was so fun to read.	Dit wie sa leuk om te lêzen.
I was almost scared to open my door.	Ik wie hast bang om myn doar iepen te dwaan.
Maybe it's better this way.	Miskien is it better op dizze manier.
You have to make one.	Jo moatte ien meitsje.
He knows he does not stand a chance.	Hy wit dat er gjin kâns makket.
They can not wait to get out of the city.	Se kinne net wachtsje om de stêd út te kommen.
We still need your help.	Wy hawwe jo help noch nedich.
And it works for me.	En it wurket foar my.
I'm sure it's going well.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it goed komt.
We finally saw where we were.	Wy hawwe lang om let sjoen wêr't wy wiene.
We get through this one way or another.	Wy komme dit op ien of oare manier troch.
It makes us who we are.	It makket ús wa't wy binne.
He just walked out.	Hy rûn krekt út.
He is at home.	Hy hat thús.
You're not really that angry.	Do bist net echt sa lilk.
I was sitting in my car.	Ik siet yn myn auto.
I do not know you either.	Ik ken dy ek net.
If she was good.	As se goed wie.
But he said nothing about it.	Mar hy sei der neat oer.
I did not even have a friend.	Ik haw net iens in freon hân.
But if you do wrong, be afraid.	Mar as jo ferkeard dogge, wês dan bang.
That's what we did.	Dat diene wy.
And those people would be wrong.	En dy minsken soene ferkeard wêze.
They know people will buy.	Se witte dat minsken sille keapje.
We talked a lot about it.	Wy hawwe der in protte oer praat.
Assume it holds.	Nim oan dat it hâldt.
That sounds good to me.	Dat liket my goed ta.
To get it done.	Om it dien te krijen.
He said he wanted to show me something.	Hy sei dat er my wat sjen litte woe.
You did not know your place.	Jo wisten jo plak net.
He did nothing about it.	Hy die dêr neat fan.
We agree not to leave.	Wy binne it iens om net fuort te gean.
I want to know about your family.	Ik wol witte oer dyn famylje.
Still through.	Noch altyd troch.
And he himself knew nothing of it.	En dêr wist er sels neat fan.
You show them what you can do.	Jo litte se sjen wat jo kinne dwaan.
Talk to him about her life.	Prate mei him oer har libben.
The question now is whether they do that too.	De fraach is no oft se dat ek dogge.
Who would not ?.	Wa soe net?.
I do not know what it is.	Ik wit net wat it is.
You told us that.	Jo hawwe ús dat ferteld.
We do not do it.	Wy dogge it net.
Other bad things, too.	Oare minne dingen, te.
Let's say so.	Litte wy it sa sizze.
We had no idea what to do.	Wy hiene gjin idee wat te dwaan.
He said it would not happen to me.	Hy sei dat it my net barre sil.
I know it's not much.	Ik wit dat it net folle is.
You can do whatever you want with them.	Jo kinne dwaan wat jo wolle mei har.
I will love you forever and ever.	Ik sil fan dy hâlde foar altyd en altyd.
And old, so very old.	En âld, sa hiel âld.
She would have given her life for him.	Se soe har libben foar him jûn hawwe.
I do not buy it.	Ik keapje it net.
I did not know better.	Ik wist net better.
Have work to do now.	Haw no wurk te dwaan.
No one had a name.	Nimmen hie in namme.
You never go home.	Jo geane noait nei hûs.
He's a good man.	Hy is in goed man.
I have a good job.	Ik haw in goede baan.
She really should go to school.	Se soe echt nei skoalle moatte.
You had to be careful.	Do moast foarsichtich wêze.
I was surprised to see how in demand it still is.	Ik wie ferrast om te sjen hoe yn fraach it noch is.
And we need to know this.	En wy moatte dit witte.
People who live there people who do things.	Minsken dy't dêr wenje minsken dy't dingen dogge.
But that's not quite how it happened.	Mar dat is net hielendal hoe't it barde.
That was not the reason.	Dat wie net de reden.
She knew from the first time.	Se wist fan de earste kear.
He was clear.	Hy wie dúdlik.
You've been working on it for a long time.	Jo hawwe der lang oan wurke.
So it's hard to be sure.	Sa is it dreech om der wis fan te wêzen.
Where she's going and she's doing well.	Wêr't se hinne sil en se docht it goed.
Here we can see how that works.	Hjir kinne wy ​​​​sjen hoe't dat wurket.
I badly needed the money.	Ik hie it jild min nedich.
Then move on to the next person and the next one.	Gean dan troch nei de folgjende persoan en de folgjende.
He is who he says he is.	Hy is wa't er seit dat hy is.
He got that in the first week.	Hy krige dat yn de earste wike.
You know they can not agree.	Jo witte dat se it net iens kinne.
All year round.	It hiele jier troch.
There's a lot too much fun.	Der is in protte te leuk.
Probably best to take a few days off.	Wierskynlik foar it bêste om in pear dagen te nimmen.
I would ask that you talk to her.	Ik soe freegje dat jo mei har prate.
In my idea.	In min idee.
You were the only person he met after hours.	Jo wiene de ienige persoan dy't hy nei oeren moete.
It was not.	It wie net.
Her mother would not have it any other way.	Har mem soe it net oars ha.
The song was old.	It liet wie âld.
I do not believe a word of it.	Ik leau der gjin wurd fan.
She just kept looking at him.	Se bleau gewoan nei him sjen.
I said something.	Ik sei wat.
That, of course, I feel.	Dat fiel ik fansels.
Had no idea what month it was.	Hie gjin idee hokker moanne it wie.
But this does not work.	Mar dit wurket net.
I'll have a word with her.	Ik sil in wurd mei har hawwe.
Then a few more.	Dan noch in pear.
But many did.	Mar in protte diene.
I was happy to do that.	Ik wie bliid om dat te dwaan.
We can talk about anything.	Wy kinne oer alles prate.
Many people want to believe he was like that.	In protte minsken wolle leauwe dat hy sa wie.
We are very happy.	Wy binne tige bliid.
They held a meeting today.	Se hawwe hjoed in gearkomste hâlden.
I like to do that.	Dat doch ik graach.
It happens, no.	It bart, no.
I talked to you that day.	Ik haw dy dei mei dy praat.
I'm of you you are of me.	Ik bin fan dy do bist fan my.
But we can not know for sure.	Mar wy kinne net wis witte.
It felt good to be tired.	It fielde goed om wurch te wêzen.
He saw his mother make food.	Hy seach syn mem iten meitsje.
I needed someone to tell me it would be okay.	Ik hie ien nedich om my te fertellen dat it goed soe wêze.
I can see it all now.	Ik kin it no allegear sjen.
However, he left it to us.	Hoe dan ek, hy liet ús dit.
I need that book.	Ik ha dat boek nedich.
She must have a reason to stop here.	Se moat in reden hawwe om hjir op te hâlden.
There they are tonight.	Dêr binne se fannacht.
My friends told me to go back there.	Myn freonen hawwe my ferteld om der werom te gean.
Maybe it wasn’t her kind of party.	Miskien wie it net har soarte fan feest.
I want to know that it's going well with him.	Ik wol witte dat it goed komt mei him.
There had been no time.	Der hie gjin tiid west.
I can handle things from here on out.	Ik kin dingen fan hjir ôf oan.
And another, and another.	En noch ien, en noch ien.
But only a few days before he.	Mar mar in pear dagen foardat hy.
He did not go home.	Hy gie net nei hûs.
So you will stay together.	Sa sille jo tegearre bliuwe.
And that's probably for the best.	En dat is wierskynlik foar it bêste.
Everything works now.	Alles wurket no.
Let's make it happy.	Litte wy it bliid meitsje.
Nobody wants that in their life.	Nimmen wol dat yn har libben.
I myself had nothing to see.	Ik sels hie neat te sjen.
We have no things to talk about.	Wy hawwe gjin dingen om oer te praten.
I had a way to go.	Ik hie in manier om te gean.
I just did.	Haw ik krekt dien.
It could not wait.	It koe net wachtsje.
Three more years.	Noch trije jier.
It has to happen.	It moat barre.
Day by day.	Dei foar dei.
I can show it to you.	Ik kin it dy sjen litte.
I have this.	Ik haw dit.
Not good.	Net goed.
You know very well why it is.	Jo witte goed wêrom't it is.
But he will come over you.	Mar hy sil oer dy komme.
He left it for me to find.	Hy liet it foar my om te finen.
He has been with it ever since.	Hy hat der sûnt dy tiid mei west.
You stay home.	Jo bliuwe thús.
It probably wouldn’t be the last.	It soe wierskynlik net de lêste wêze.
It was no water.	It wie gjin wetter.
We could get in trouble for nothing.	Wy koene foar neat yn de problemen komme.
First time, last time.	Earste kear, lêste kear.
Or she still.	Of se noch.
It's about doing.	It giet om dwaan.
People tell me you're very nice.	Minsken sizze my datst hiel aardich bist.
I said your name.	Ik sei dyn namme.
Let him say nothing.	Lit him neat sizze.
I visited them often.	Ik besocht se faak.
Clearly, that was the next thing to do.	Dúdlik wie dat it folgjende ding te dwaan.
I put it with him.	Ik sette it by him.
We've never seen her.	Wy hawwe har nea sjoen.
Do what you have to do.	Doch wat jo moatte dwaan.
Didn't know anyone really did that anymore.	Wist net dat ien dat echt mear die.
I just do not want you to worry about me.	Ik wol gewoan net dat jo soargen meitsje oer my.
The only question is how soon.	De ienige fraach is hoe gau.
It’s about what you do.	It giet oer wat jo dogge.
Not so good with people.	Net sa goed mei minsken.
It's just me.	It is gewoan ik.
I do not know if it's still there.	Ik wit net oft it der noch is.
We got into a bit of trouble, but not really.	Wy krigen in bytsje problemen, mar net echt.
He liked that.	Hy fûn dat leuk.
But only almost.	Mar allinnich hast.
We do a lot of things together.	Wy dogge in protte dingen tegearre.
I did not say this.	Ik sei dit net.
It's actually from my father.	It is eins fan myn heit.
He can do nothing else.	Hy kin neat oars dwaan.
I knew this, but what felt different this time.	Ik wist dit, mar wat fielde dizze kear oars.
I would love for you to have this.	Ik soe graach wolle dat jo dit hawwe.
Try another door.	Besykje in oare doar.
Not really time to do it.	Net echt tiid om it te dwaan.
But it did not seem likely.	Mar it like net wierskynlik.
She was everything he wanted in a woman.	Se wie alles wat er woe yn in frou.
They have been doing this for a long time.	Dat hawwe se al lang dien.
What was her name?	Wat wie har namme?
That should help him a little bit.	Dat soe him in bytsje helpe moatte.
The one no one wanted.	Dejinge dy't nimmen woe.
This was a bad idea.	Dit wie in min idee.
So many parents do.	Dat dogge safolle âlden.
This is how it goes.	Sa giet it.
Do not take a year off from me.	Nim jo net in jier fan my ôf.
You work too hard.	Jo wurkje te hurd.
He just did not want to.	Hy woe gewoan net.
Tom looked away.	Tom seach fuort.
Think about it and come back to us.	Tink der oer en kom werom nei ús.
This is going badly, they think.	Dit giet min ôf, tinke se.
But there was nothing he could do.	Mar der wie neat dat er dwaan koe.
Nice and easy.	Moai en maklik.
I sat down quickly.	Ik siet gau.
The best we can do now is wait.	It bêste dat wy no kinne dwaan is wachtsje.
I would have been good to you.	Ik soe goed foar dy west hawwe.
Not surprised there.	Net ferrast dêr.
You would wait.	Jo soene wachtsje op.
Be so.	Wês sa.
He will give everything he has.	Hy sil alles jaan wat er hat.
As if there was only one book.	As wie der mar ien boek.
He did a lot.	Hy die in protte.
I agreed with him.	Ik wie it mei him iens.
I let it go.	Ik liet it gean.
I've told you the truth.	Ik haw jo de wierheid ferteld.
It's there, it's not going away, it's there.	It is der, it giet net fuort, it is der.
Think of your dog.	Tink oan jo hûn.
People will try to take those away from me.	Minsken sille besykje dy fan my ôf te nimmen.
It is clear that he is not her husband.	It is dúdlik dat hy net har man is.
Children back to school.	Bern werom nei skoalle.
Everything has been asked before.	Alles is earder frege.
It was about it now.	It gie oer it no.
And she needed that now.	En dat hie se no nedich.
Sa? 	Sa?
And that would be three.	En dat soe trije wêze.
He's coming back soon.	Hy komt gau werom.
That you need this or that.	Dat jo dit of dat nedich hawwe.
That too seems wrong to me.	Ek dat liket my ferkeard.
This does not look good.	Dit liket net goed.
Everyone knows everything.	Elkenien wit alles.
People are happy about it too.	Minsken binne der ek bliid fan.
I could not wait to get out of this place.	Ik koe net wachtsje om út dit plak te kommen.
Could have had them.	Koe se hawwe.
I need to find a way to make this happen.	Ik moat in manier fine om dit barre te meitsjen.
I was a woman.	Ik wie in frou.
It should be an opportunity to do things differently.	It moat in kâns wêze om dingen oars te dwaan.
But there you go.	Mar dêr komme jo út.
She talks a lot about her work.	Se praat in protte oer har wurk.
Everything about this movie is first class.	Alles oer dizze film is earste klasse.
She did not feel well.	Se fielde har net goed.
They want to be in class.	Se wolle yn 'e klasse.
It's exactly the same thing.	It is krekt itselde ding.
That it is actually there and it is true.	Dat it is der eins en it is wier.
It can still happen.	It kin noch wol.
That will remain so.	Dat sil sa bliuwe.
No one should help him.	Nimmen moat him helpe.
It's getting better.	It wurdt better.
That's what he said.	Dat sei er eins.
She's fine.	Se is goed.
People find that.	Minsken fine dat.
There are a few enough of us.	Der binne in pear genôch fan ús.
No time for any of it, now.	Gjin tiid foar ien fan it, no.
She did it three times.	Se die it trije kear.
You never hurt.	Do hast noait sear.
I'm sorry about that earlier.	It spyt my oer earder.
He looked very worried.	Hy seach der tige soargen út.
I could not see it clearly.	Ik koe it net dúdlik sjen.
She knew she did not want it.	Se wist dat se it net woe.
People come every day.	Minsken komme alle dagen.
Nobody asked me to.	Nimmen frege my om.
If you did, you were right.	As jo ​​​​dat diene, wiene jo goed.
She could buy whatever she wanted.	Se koe keapje wat se woe.
We'll do it.	Wy sille it dwaan.
I have no problem with this.	Ik haw gjin probleem mei dizze.
It just is not.	It is gewoan net.
I looked around.	Ik seach om my hinne.
The question is whether you should make one yourself.	De fraach is oft jo sels ien meitsje moatte.
It should be easy.	It moat maklik wêze.
What.	Wat.
We talk about a lot of things.	Wy prate oer in protte dingen.
You will never find it again.	Jo sille it noait wer fine.
How do you say it.	Hoe sizze jo it.
She thought she might be someone.	Se tocht dat se miskien wol ien wie.
What a man would be.	Wat foar in man soe.
They are very, very different.	Se binne hiel, hiel oars.
I knew his mother well.	Ik koe syn mem goed.
He knew everything and nothing.	Hy wist alles en neat.
That does not make it better.	Dat makket it net better.
I know it looks like a lot.	Ik wit dat it liket in protte.
His mother went to school.	Syn mem joech skoalle.
He came home late last night.	Hy kaam fannacht let thús.
There is nothing like it.	Der is neat as it.
He came to notice and everyone was already sitting.	Hy kaam te let en elkenien siet al.
He had not done so himself.	Dat hie er sels net dien.
They were never without each other.	Se wiene nea sûnder elkoar.
But, a house.	Mar, in hûs.
It's who we are.	It is wa't wy binne.
For me, it's both.	Foar my is it beide.
It's everyone who worked for them.	It is elkenien dy't foar har wurke.
This time I'm just.	Dizze kear bin ik gewoan.
Do not tell him what we are planning.	Fertel him net wat wy fan plan binne.
But it came back.	Mar it kaam werom.
She had only hoped, with him, it could be otherwise.	Se hie mar hope, mei him, koe it oars.
It would never work.	It soe nea wurkje.
I always.	Ik altyd .
This is a really, really good book.	Dit is in echt, echt goed boek.
It can not just be read.	It kin net gewoan lêzen wurde.
Well, you know how she is.	No, jo witte hoe't se is.
And of course you have to stay out of trouble.	En jo moatte fansels út de problemen bliuwe.
He looked scared.	Hy seach bang.
That's just not good enough.	Dat is gewoan net goed genôch.
That's what we said.	Dat hawwe wy sein.
It's hard to say how much water you have left over.	It is min te sizzen hoefolle wetter jo oer hawwe.
My parents never let it go when we are not home.	Myn âlden litte it noait oan as wy net thús binne.
But when it worked it was fun.	Mar doe't it wurke wie it leuk.
If you do not, it's time to dump her and move on.	As jo ​​​​dat net docht, is it tiid om in nije te finen.
He told me he loves me.	Hy fertelde my dat hy fan my hâldt.
Those were not such a thing.	Dat wiene net sa'n ding.
If it does not work.	As it net wurket.
But they are not as good as a person.	Mar se binne net sa goed as in persoan.
I plan to have something.	Ik plan wat te hawwen.
That's what it's about today, not the girl.	Dêr giet it hjoed om, net it famke.
Wait and see.	Wachtsje en sjoch.
I wonder what she's sorry about.	Ik freegje my ôf wêr't se it spyt fan hat.
That was the only way.	Dat wie de ienige manier.
Her hair was fine.	Har hier wie goed.
But that does not happen so soon.	Mar dat bart net sa gau.
It's not difficult either.	It is ek net dreech.
Would you disagree ?.	Soene jo it net iens wêze?.
I wish you .	Ik winskje dy .
I want him to do it.	Ik wol dat er it docht.
I feel like he's looking at me.	Ik fiel dat er nei my sjocht.
However, no one wants them.	Hoe dan ek, nimmen wol se.
I know a lot of people.	Ik ken in protte minsken.
I can not wait, man.	Ik kin net wachtsje, man.
But he kept them to himself.	Mar hy hâlde se foar himsels.
A young man approached me.	In jonge man kaam my oan.
I think they are.	Ik tink dat se binne.
And we'll get you next year.	En wy krije jo takom jier.
They can be really, really good.	Se kinne wêze echt, echt goed.
Well, you do not.	No, jo net.
This can be anything.	Dit kin fan alles wêze.
Take it in.	Nim dy mar yn.
He walked to the house.	Hy rûn nei it hûs ta.
That's their job and both are doing well.	Dat is har wurk en beide dogge it goed.
I worked for both.	Ik wurke foar beide.
I think it's a him.	Ik tink dat it in him is.
I made this with my friend.	Ik makke dit mei myn freon.
I walked again.	Ik rûn wer.
He hopes to find a better job.	Hy hopet in bettere baan te finen.
He is so.	Hy is sa.
I can do that, no problem.	Ik kin dat dwaan, gjin probleem.
You have worked so hard.	Jo hawwe sa hurd wurke.
It should not be that long.	It soe net sa lang wêze moatte.
Or maybe not.	Of miskien net.
All he has to do is tell the truth.	Alles wat hy hoecht te dwaan is de wierheid te fertellen.
Well, he said to no one.	Goed, sei er tsjin nimmen.
You would not like to show it either.	Jo soene it ek net graach sjen litte.
But now you know it's not that easy.	Mar no witte jo dat it net sa maklik is.
Nobody knew about you.	Nimmen wist oer dy.
Day after day.	Dei op dei.
It can not be otherwise.	It kin net oars.
I did not want to tell you.	Ik woe it dy net graach fertelle.
That’s when they open up for food.	Dat is doe't se iepen foar iten.
But we are waiting for you, just like before.	Mar wy wachtsje op dy, krekt as earder.
But that's fine, you do not need everyone.	Mar dat is goed, jo hawwe net elkenien nedich.
I will have nothing of that kind in this house.	Ik sil neat fan dat soarte yn dit hûs hawwe.
You just have to look and see.	Jo moatte gewoan sjen en sjen.
But we have, and we can.	Mar wy hawwe, en wy kinne.
It's what we do.	It is wat wy dogge.
Before you buy, visit us.	Foardat jo keapje, besykje ús.
For three hours. 	Foar trije oeren. 
And this house.	En dit hûs.
She could not tell.	Se koe it net fertelle.
He knows he's doing wrong.	Hy wit dat er ferkeard docht.
I can tell her why.	Ik kin har fertelle wêrom.
asked the boy.	frege de jonge.
Even he the.	Sels hy die.
I went to her.	Ik gie nei har ta.
A few will be told, but many will soon know.	In pear sille wurde ferteld, mar in protte sille gau witte.
So we are told.	Sa wurde wy ferteld.
That’s where they take it from.	Dêr nimme se it fan.
I will have something else.	Ik sil wat oars hawwe.
The children were sick and could not go to school.	De bern wiene siik en koene net nei skoalle.
That leaves me with only one at home.	Dat lit my mei mar ien thús.
I'll see you.	Ik sil dy sjen.
They go hand in hand.	Se geane hân yn hân.
Not that she knew of her.	Net dat se fan har wist.
Can't say anything yet.	Kin noch neat sizze.
That, of course, is not what happened.	Dat is fansels net wat der bard is.
I know that very well.	Ik wit dat hiel goed.
You know you should not be here.	Jo witte dat jo hjir net moatte wêze.
But that did not happen last time.	Mar dat is de lêste kear net bard.
She loves it here.	Se hâldt it hjir.
We just play.	Wy spylje gewoan.
There was no one without work.	Der wie gjinien sûnder wurk.
Well, if you just want to.	No, as jo gewoan wolle.
There are no words for.	Der binne gjin wurden foar.
But he heard me.	Mar hy hearde my.
No one came to him.	Nimmen kaam by him.
I did not hear any more.	Ik hearde net mear.
No way would he chance that.	Gjin manier soe hy kâns dat.
We want the kids back.	Wy wolle de bern werom.
But it does not look like that now.	Mar it liket der no net op.
Next time, we hope to stay a month.	De folgjende kear hoopje wy in moanne te bliuwen.
They go off for days at a time.	Se geane dagen op ien kear ôf.
It hit hard.	It rekke hurd.
It was the same when his mother was sick.	It wie itselde doe't syn mem siik wie.
That she had been herself as a child.	Dat hie se sels as bern west.
You're the only one who could not.	Do bist de iennichste dy't net koe.
He will give her that, he will give her what she wants.	Hy sil har dat jaan, hy sil har jaan wat se wol.
They decided to stay where they were.	Se besletten om te bliuwen wêr't se wiene.
This should be fine.	Dit moat goed wêze.
Go away and do it.	Gean fuort en doch it.
But everyone has.	Mar elkenien hat.
You need to get off the bus.	Jo moatte út 'e bus.
I wanted more.	Ik woe mear.
I'll see him.	Ik sil him sjen.
For many, nothing was really clear.	Foar in protte wie neat echt dúdlik.
A woman with three children.	In frou mei trije bern.
I did that and ran pretty well.	Ik die dat en rûn aardich goed.
She would have been scared.	Se soe bang west hawwe.
You can be sure she will get the job.	Jo kinne der wis fan wêze dat se de baan sil krije.
Most likely you will.	Hiel wierskynlik dat jo sille.
Afraid to do what's good.	Bang om te dwaan wat goed is.
They play more together.	Se spylje mear tegearre.
Her work has never been done.	Har wurk is nea dien.
And it is not.	En it is net.
That's what they're asking for.	Dat freegje se.
It may be the same for you.	It kin itselde wêze foar jo.
He did not seem so interested.	Hy like net sa ynteressearre.
I will take care of that.	Dêr sil ik foar soargje.
I even convinced him to record them again.	Ik sels oertsjûge him om se wer op te nimmen.
Do what you can for him.	Doch wat jo kinne foar him.
Always will and always have.	Altyd sil en altyd hawwe.
He will become a father, and look at me.	Hy sil heit wurde, en sjoch my oan.
Not on its own.	Net op himsels.
If anything happened it would happen now.	As der wat barde soe it no barre.
People do not like him.	Minsken hâlde net fan him.
I went back to the office.	Ik gie werom nei it kantoar.
If he did, you would know it.	As hy it die, soene jo it witte.
You can buy them.	Jo kinne keapje se.
In both.	Yn beide.
Believe that please.	Leau dat asjebleaft.
But you ask yourself.	Mar jo freegje jo ôf.
Maybe something would happen.	Miskien soe der wat barre.
I'm waking up for tomorrow.	Ik wurd wekker foar moarn.
It may come soon.	It kin gau komme.
You just know what needs to happen.	Jo witte gewoan wat der barre moat.
Come if you want.	Kom as jo wolle.
My dog ​​will stay with me.	Myn hûn sil by my bliuwe.
I'm happy about it.	Ik bin der bliid fan.
But there was more to come.	Mar der kaam noch mear.
The best is yet to come!.	It bêste moat noch komme!.
I do not know how many, but a few.	Ik wit net hoefolle, mar in pear.
Whether you believe it or not, it does not matter.	Oft jo it leauwe of net, makket neat út.
She will come with us.	Se sil mei ús komme.
He did not want to be asked what he thought.	Hy woe net frege wurde wat er tocht.
Home is home.	Thús is thús.
I hope this young woman will do the same.	Ik hoopje dat dizze jonge frou itselde sil dwaan.
But no one knew what to do.	Mar nimmen wist wat te dwaan.
We do not have that.	Dat hawwe wy net.
We'll just wait.	Wy wachtsje mar.
Not sure who said that first.	Net wis wa't dat earst sei.
Those things are all true.	Dy dingen binne allegear wier.
She has a name.	Se hat in namme.
Maybe someone knows more.	Miskien wit immen mear.
Time to do what's good.	Tiid om te dwaan wat goed is.
You've told me that before.	Dat hawwe jo my earder sein.
Bad is good.	Min is goed.
But he was not what she expected.	Mar hy wie net wat se ferwachte hie.
I've never seen one before.	Ik haw noait earder sjoen.
He gave her some food.	Hy joech har wat iten.
You have never finished a single book.	Jo hawwe noait ien boek klear.
And for a long time nothing happened.	En der barde lang neat.
She had said it.	Se hie it sein.
Dad had to work.	Heit moast wurkje.
I do every day.	Ik doch alle dagen.
If her mother is not there, you will not go.	As har mem der net is, geane jo net.
I love your office.	Ik hâld fan dyn kantoar.
There needs to be more to this.	Der moat mear oan dit.
And they both know they can not stay here.	En beide witte se dat se hjir net bliuwe kinne.
Everything could hurt, everything could hurt, he could hurt.	Alles koe sear dwaan, alles koe sear dwaan, hy koe sear dwaan.
He's there.	Hy is dêr.
He does not want to talk about it.	Hy wol der net oer prate.
Nobody cares.	Nimmen makket it der om.
I could not let him.	Ik koe him net litte.
Let's keep it that way.	Litte wy it sa hâlde.
Nothing like it has happened since.	Neat like it is sûnt bard.
He said it was out of the question.	Hy sei dat it út 'e fraach wie.
Tell me what you can do.	Fertel my wat jo dwaan kinne.
You can see me now.	Jo kinne my no sjen.
We ask nothing.	Wy freegje neat.
That goes on.	Dat giet troch.
My mother never knew what to do with me.	Myn mem wist noait wat se mei my dwaan moast.
It's what you want to work on.	It is wat jo wolle wurkje oan.
Her life, her work.	Har libben, har wurk.
He is tired, and not quite well.	Hy is wurch, en net hielendal goed.
They need them.	Se hawwe har nedich.
We want to get it done.	Wy wolle it dien krije.
Sure, you can get hurt.	Wis, jo kinne sear wurde.
Let's see how this happens.	Lit ús sjen hoe't dit bart.
Over and over and over and over.	Oer en oer en oer en oer.
Maybe it would be best if he said nothing.	Miskien soe it it bêste wêze as er neat sei.
But something about it does not sit well with me.	Mar wat dêr sit my net hielendal goed by.
Just leave it at that.	Lit it der no mar by.
Neither do we.	Wy ek net.
I thought you were all too easy.	Ik tocht dat jo allegear te maklik wiene.
That it was done.	Dat it dien wie.
You are who you are and that is that.	Jo binne wa't jo binne en dat is dat.
I want to give it a try.	Ik wol it in kâns jaan.
I think you can take my word for it.	Ik tink dat jo myn wurd der foar nimme kinne.
Not so much.	Net sa folle.
Maybe a year.	Miskien in jier.
This will always be you.	Dit sil jo altyd wêze.
I had not done much work with him yet.	Ik hie noch net folle wurk mei him dien.
Really fun read.	Echt leuk lêzen.
She had no reason to.	Se hie gjin reden ta.
Now it's too late.	No is it te let.
But maybe you can help me.	Mar miskien kinne jo my helpe.
Think about it, just think back.	Tink foar, tink gewoan werom.
I have to get out of this city.	Ik moat út dizze stêd.
That's where we'll be.	Dat is wêr't wy sille wêze.
They love what they do.	Se hâlde fan wat se dogge.
His father was all he had left.	Syn heit wie alles wat er oer hie.
Other than that she was fine.	Oars as dat se wie goed.
We better not let this happen.	Wy litte dit better net barre.
Let's do that now.	Litte wy dat no dwaan.
And that happens.	En dat bart.
I never expected that to happen.	Ik hie nea ferwachte dat dat soe barre.
Please let him know if I do.	Lit him asjebleaft witte as ik.
I feel like a child.	Ik fiel my as in bern.
And she will get it right.	En se sil it goed krije.
Well done you !!.	Goed dien jo!!.
He told her everything he knew.	Hy fertelde har alles wat er wist.
Away, just like that.	Fuort, krekt sa.
It's not gone.	It is net fuort.
Must be over now.	Moat no oer wêze.
I have to go home.	Ik moat thús.
Get better.	Better wurde.
I'm trying to figure out how to do that.	Ik besykje út te finen hoe't ik dat dwaan moat.
For this day.	Foar dizze dei.
Well, let me go to my work.	No, lit my nei myn wurk.
That just is not enough time.	Dat is gewoan net genôch tiid.
The things people believe are not always true.	De dingen dy't minsken leauwe binne net altyd wier.
I ask him if he can come please.	Ik freegje him oft er asjebleaft komme kin.
I do not know what to do now.	Ik wit net wat ik no dwaan moat.
I had no idea what it was.	Ik hie gjin idee wat it wie.
That is what we expected.	Dat hawwe wy ferwachte.
It was completely different.	It wie hielendal oars.
No one asked.	Gjinien frege.
He felt it.	Hy fielde it.
Once would have to do.	Ien kear soe dwaan moatte.
Everything is yours.	Alles is fan jo.
They were not interested.	Dy ynteressearre har net.
Here everyone can see him.	Hjir kin elkenien him sjen.
I had to do everything myself.	Ik moast alles sels dwaan.
He said nothing more and did not hesitate.	Hy sei neat mear en hoegde net.
I'm looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der nei út.
I doubt this.	Ik twifelje dit.
We did it very well.	Wy hawwe it hiel goed dien.
And it works really well.	En it wurket echt goed.
To tell him how it was at home.	Om him te fertellen hoe't it thús siet.
I have no words for you anymore.	Ik haw gjin wurden mear foar dy.
If you get it wrong, it's not fun.	As jo ​​krije it ferkeard, it is net leuk.
He says not a word.	Hy seit gjin wurd.
Man to man.	Man oan man.
Very soon he would show up.	Hiel gau soe er sjen litte.
Not without telling him everything.	Net sûnder him alles te fertellen.
I've talked to a lot of the good people.	Ik haw mei in protte fan 'e goede minsken praat.
But he had to.	Mar hy moast.
Of course, that is not possible right now.	Fansels kin dat no net.
But you have.	Mar do hast.
But this way too long.	Mar dizze manier te lang.
That was his job.	Dat wie syn wurk.
Something happened to him.	Der barde wat mei him.
He heard three words.	Hy hearde trije wurden.
He went into himself.	Hy gie yn himsels.
He was afraid to go to jail.	Hy wie bang om nei de finzenis te gean.
We just have today.	Wy hawwe gewoan hjoed.
I met the man a few times.	Ik moete de man in pear kear.
What is good must be clear.	Wat goed is moat dúdlik wêze.
But it was not.	Mar it wie net.
I do not know where it came from.	Ik wit net wêr't it wei kaam.
Well, your father.	No, dyn heit.
I wanted to say.	Ik woe sizze.
There had to be a way out.	Dêr moast in wei wei komme.
Go back there.	Gean der werom.
It's not hard to see why.	It is net dreech om te sjen wêrom.
But are they real.	Mar binne se echt.
Which was bad.	Wat min wie.
And good things happened.	En der binne goede dingen bard.
Or with me.	Of mei my.
That has never been true.	Dat hat nea wier west.
They work hard.	Se wurkje hurd.
A better me.	In bettere my.
I'll try to talk to him tomorrow.	Ik sil moarn besykje mei him te praten.
But about my friend here.	Mar oer myn freon hjir.
But you should not think too well of me.	Mar jo moatte net te goed oer my tinke.
But he said none of those things.	Mar hy sei neat fan dy dingen.
So do children.	Dat dogge bern.
Not her first husband.	Net har earste man.
He took the seat against me.	Hy naam de sit tsjin my yn.
There was plenty to see.	Der wie genôch te sjen.
Nothing more than that.	Neat mear as dat.
It's time to go to bed.	It is tiid om op bêd te gean.
That will happen.	Dat sil barre.
It goes to.	It giet nei.
We'll have to have some kind of party.	Wy sille in soarte fan feest hâlde moatte.
Give the man a chance.	Jou de man in kâns.
Do not watch that happen.	Sjoch dat net barre.
He can not get a job.	Hy kin gjin baan krije.
It's something else.	It is wat oars.

Do not worry about it.	Sit der gjin soargen oer.
You can eat as you like.	Jo kinne ite as jo wolle.
I will not be happy with that.	Ik sil der net bliid mei wêze.
I think there's something going on.	Ik tink dat der wat oan de hân is.
Everything was ready.	Alles wie klear.
Then things are different.	Dan binne dingen oars.
He was surprised.	Hy wie ferrast.
I'll have one of them.	Ik sil der ien fan ha.
But you do not have to do it by hand.	Mar jo moatte it net mei de hân dwaan.
So was everything else.	Sa wie al it oare.
We were free.	Wy wiene frij.
I have a name.	Ik haw in namme.
It knows its way.	It wit syn wei.
This woman was not one of those things.	Dizze frou wie net ien fan dy dingen.
This time it would happen.	Dizze kear soe it barre.
Do not feel you have to.	Fiel jo net dat jo moatte.
Well, not much.	No, net folle.
This was until this morning.	Dit wie oant hjoed de moarn.
It always has been, it always will be.	It hat altyd west, it sil altyd.
No one told me it would be so.	Nimmen fertelde my dat it sa wêze soe.
Then you can not get people to stay away.	Dan kinne jo minsken net krije om fuort te bliuwen.
There was not much left.	Der wie net folle fan oer.
But enough talk.	Mar genôch praat.
And love him.	En hâld fan him.
You've never seen anything like it.	Do hast noait sa'n ding sjoen as my.
Everyone knew her there and loved her.	Elkenien koe se dêr en hâlde fan har.
I never found it.	Ik haw it noait fûn.
All right, in my book.	Alles goed, yn myn boek.
His hand on hers.	Syn hân op har hân.
Nothing more can be said.	Der kin neat mear sein wurde.
Work your way around them.	Wurkje jo wei om har hinne.
Not sure why and how to get around it.	Net wis wêrom en hoe te krijen om it.
There is not much time.	Der is net folle tiid.
What we'll do next.	Wat wy sille dwaan lyn.
He opened it again.	Hy die se wer iepen.
And who would not even believe me.	En wa soe my net iens leauwe.
This must be different.	Dit moat oars.
But she felt there was nothing to be afraid of, not really.	Mar se fielde dat der neat wie om bang foar te wêzen, net echt.
It looks different for everyone.	It sjocht der oars foar elkenien.
I'm glad she's not in there.	Ik bin bliid dat se dêr net yn sit.
It was good enough.	It wie goed genôch.
Well, there was nothing he could do about it.	No, dêr koe er neat oan dwaan.
I think this really is it.	Ik tink dat dit echt it is.
I have not seen any of that.	Dêr haw ik neat fan sjoen.
He was not there.	Hy wie der net.
That's the chance.	Dat is de kâns.
For one day.	Foar ien dei.
He had come ready.	Hy wie klear kommen.
Again very happy with.	Wer tige bliid mei.
There are many good people who do the same thing.	D'r binne in protte goede minsken dy't itselde ding dogge.
I did not think of that.	Dêr tocht ik net oan.
She never talked about him.	Se hat noait oer him praat.
She did not think of him.	Se tocht net oan him.
This would have been a good idea.	Dit hie in goed idee west.
Is there one way to get this problem.	Is d'r ien manier om dit probleem te krijen.
I love her.	Ik hâld fan har.
That book is this book.	Dat boek is dit boek.
There are still problems.	Der binne noch problemen.
She needs me.	Se hat my nedich.
And so it may be.	En sa kin it wêze.
I still want to.	Ik noch wol.
But it did not seem to her, not exactly.	Mar it like har net, net krekt.
And decided to take it all in stride.	En besletten om alles te nimmen.
But there was almost none of that.	Mar dêr wie hast neat fan.
We need to take care of our people.	Wy moatte foar ús minsken soargje.
This is just not right.	Dit is gewoan net krekt.
And children even more.	En bern noch mear.
I don't believe.	Ik leau it net.
What was her name.	Wat wie har namme.
And we're doing it right.	En wy dogge it goed.
I told your father this.	Ik fertelde jo heit dit.
She really kept her place.	Se hat echt har plak hâlden.
That's for another time.	Dat is foar in oare tiid.
Please leave us back in the house.	Lit ús asjebleaft werom yn 'e hûs.
They had been there before.	Se hiene der al earder west.
He would not return.	Hy soe net werom.
I was back to school the first day.	Ik wie de earste dei werom nei skoalle.
Well, one thing is for sure.	No, ien ding is wis.
I would he.	Ik soe hy.
With this book.	Mei dit boek.
I will not keep you for long.	Ik sil dy net lang hâlde.
We know this is not true.	Wy witte dat dit net wier is.
Nice place, that.	Moai plak, dat.

It depends.	Dêr komt it oan.
He knew who was talking.	Hy wist wa't praat.
What is what we do.	Wat is wat wy dogge.
People were sure they were on to something.	Minsken wiene der wis fan dat se op wat wiene.
Please keep this in mind.	Hâld dit asjebleaft yn gedachten.
I have decided to read another book.	Ik haw besletten noch in boek te lêzen.
If she could find a way up.	As se koe fine in wei op.
I just know the place.	Ik wit krekt it plak.
He had to find something.	Hy moast wat fine.
Until that hour anything can happen.	Oant dat oere kin fan alles barre.
, not me.	, net ik.
It shows a lot about this child.	It lit in protte oer dit bern sjen.
If it happened.	As it barde.
And they are very good at it.	En se binne der tige goed yn.
She entered her house, and looked around.	Se kaam har hûs yn, en seach om.
It just seemed too obvious.	It like gewoan te dúdlik.
Let that not happen.	Lit dat net barre.
No one was there to help her.	Nimmen wie der om har te helpen.
I just want to show it to her.	Ik wol it har gewoan sjen litte.
And he talks there with people, do not doubt.	En hy praat dêr mei minsken, twifelje net.
I have been waiting for the right time and the time is now.	Ik haw wachte op 'e goede tiid en de tiid is no.
Not as much as he should be.	Net sa folle as hy moat wêze.
It would have been nice to buy it for him.	It hie leuk west om it foar him te keapjen.
Not the car.	Net de auto.
You've never done this before.	Jo hawwe dit noch noait earder dien.
You heard me.	Do hast my heard.
That is no longer so certain today.	Dat is hjoed net mear sa wis.
Everyone is fine.	Elkenien is goed.
That was for other people.	Dat wie foar oare minsken.
I wanted it bad.	Ik woe it min.
He would not talk to anyone.	Hy soe mei gjinien prate.
People know very little about him.	Minsken witte hiel min oer him.

You make people happy and that's nice.	Jo meitsje minsken bliid en dat is moai.
You should be happy.	Jo moatte bliid wêze.
Far too good, after all.	Folle te goed, nei alle gedachten.
It was a good enough plan.	It wie in goed genôch plan.
Not sure about the question.	Net wis oer de fraach.
We will see them through this.	Wy sille har troch dit sjen.
Sit back.	Sit werom.
He had to tell her everything.	Hy moast har alles fertelle.
He has a large family.	Hy hat in grutte famylje.
They are always given to people to read.	Se wurde altyd oan minsken jûn om te lêzen.
I want to tell his mother about that too.	Dêr wol ik syn mem ek oer fertelle.
He said it would not work.	Hy sei dat it net soe wurkje.
Be where you said you would be.	Wês wêr't jo seine dat jo wêze soene.
It's good.	It is goed.
There you can find your people.	Dêr kinne jo jo minsken fine.
He's just better than me today.	Hy is hjoed gewoan better as my.
Sit and think.	Siet en tocht.
You've probably seen one right now.	Jo hawwe wierskynlik ien sjoen krekt no.
Please let me know if there is a way around this.	Lit my asjebleaft witte as der in manier om dit hinne is.
He knows me too well.	Hy ken my te goed.
Just finished it yourself.	Krekt klear it sels.
Think hard enough and you wish it away.	Tink hurd genôch en jo winskje it fuort.
She was angry that her mother was still awake.	Se wie lilk dat har mem noch wekker wie.
I felt that way every day.	Ik fielde my sa alle dagen.
We tried both.	Wy hawwe beide besocht.
However, it will happen.	Hoe dan ek, it sil barre.
She gave it her all.	Se joech alles.
I actually have.	Ik haw eins.
But these are my last days.	Mar dit binne myn lêste dagen.
She had the time for everyone.	Se hie de tiid foar elkenien.
People are afraid of him.	Minsken binne bang foar him.
Or maybe they don’t want to.	Of miskien wolle se net.
You will be too.	Jo sille ek wêze.
He's not coming back.	Hy komt net werom.
I've never heard him talk to me like that before.	Ik haw him noch noait sa tsjin my prate heard.
And he was a good man to you.	En hy wie in goede man foar dy.
Clearly, he did not like how she made it.	It is dúdlik dat hy net leuk hie hoe't se it makke.
She had not really asked why.	Se hie net echt frege wêrom.
But they work.	Mar se wurkje.
I think the hair looks good too.	Ik tink dat it hier ek goed sjocht.
Come what may, they will always be with me.	Kom wat wol, se sille altyd by my wêze.
Her parents had really done it.	Har âlden hiene it echt dien.
I will keep these things in mind.	Ik sil dizze dingen yn gedachten hâlde.
Let's look at that.	Litte wy der nei sjen.
But it happens.	Mar it bart.
With me you know where you are going.	Mei my witte jo wêr't jo hinne geane.
I can do it myself.	Ik kin it sels dwaan.
I was ready to do something.	Ik wie ree om wat te dwaan.
I doubt many people have.	Ik twifelje dat in protte minsken hawwe.
Maybe, just maybe.	Miskien, gewoan miskien.
You have to make that movie.	Jo moatte dy film meitsje.
He knew how to do that well.	Hy wist dat goed te dwaan.
She did not look up from her book.	Se seach net op út har boek.
They will need him more than they think.	Se sille him mear nedich wêze as se tinke.
She can do nothing.	Se kin neat dwaan.
We did not need that.	Dat hiene wy ​​net nedich.
It could be one of your children.	It kin ien fan jo bern wêze.
For the time being.	Foar de tiid.
Really, he should not.	Echt, hy moat net.
I'm really not scared.	Ik bin echt bang net.
He found himself alone.	Hy fûn himsels allinnich.
We did it together.	Wy diene it tegearre.
But most likely he does.	Mar wierskynlik docht er dat.
But he's not here now, and you are.	Mar hy is hjir net no, en do bist.
That is not enough.	Dat is net genôch.
I'm not talking to anyone.	Ik praat mei gjinien.
I have school and such.	Ik haw skoalle en sa.
Woman wanted to see.	Frou woe sjen.
I should not have said it.	Ik hie it net sizze moatten.
Clearly this is not the problem.	Dúdlik is dit net it probleem.
For me, who could stay home to look after my family.	Foar my, wa koe thús bliuwe om nei myn famylje te sjen.
See what we can do.	Sjoch wat wy kinne dwaan.
I love that car.	Ik hâld fan dy auto.

This can not be done.	Dit kin net dien wurde.
He's there, photo and all.	Hy is der, foto en al.
I think we play well in that.	Ik tink dat wy der goed yn spylje.

It does not concern me.	It giet my net oan.
This was truth.	Dit wie wierheid.
Her parents were not happy.	Har âlden wiene net bliid.
I just needed to know you.	Ik moast jo gewoan witte.
Anyway, it works now.	Hoe dan ek, it wurket no.
That should be easy to do.	Dat moat maklik te dwaan.
Of course, things do not have to go that way.	Fansels hoege de dingen net sa te gean.
She did not even look at him.	Se seach net iens nei him.
That's just wrong.	Dat is gewoan ferkeard.
You can have him now if you want him.	Jo kinne him no hawwe as jo him wolle.
That will be the last.	Dat sil de lêste wêze.
When he looked back, it was gone.	Doe't er werom seach, wie it fuort.
I was not happy.	Ik wie net bliid.
He also worries about her.	Hy makket him ek soargen oer har.
She's not real, she's not there.	Se is net echt, se is der net.
This was the last time she saw her father alive.	Dit wie de lêste kear dat se har heit yn libben seach.
People are afraid of what they do not know.	Minsken binne bang foar wat se net witte.
And nobody cares.	En nimmen docht der wat oan.
I'm sure you've seen this happen before.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo hawwe sjoen dit barre foar.

But the dog is yours.	Mar de hûn is fan jo.

Everyone is watching.	Elkenien sjocht.
It's not that easy to find your way.	It is net sa maklik om jo wei te finen.
This only happened every now and then.	Dit barde mar sa no en dan.
I'm too late.	Ik bin te let.
They never spoke.	Se hawwe nea praat.
He really wanted to hurt her.	Hy woe har echt sear dwaan.
But they were there for more than just that.	Mar se wiene der foar mear as allinnich dat.
I'm not trying to be first.	Ik besykje net earst te wêzen.
But she was too late.	Mar se wie te let.

Everyone saw it.	Elkenien seach it.
She's wrong.	Se is ferkeard.

See this why.	Sjoch it dit wêrom.
I can no longer.	Ik kin net mear.
This is not easy at all.	Dit is hielendal net maklik.
I do not know what to do about it.	Ik wit net wat ik der hielendal oan dwaan moat.
It's probably nothing, but it's worth seeing.	It is wierskynlik neat, mar it moat sjoen wurde.
Just my idea of ​​a good time.	Krekt myn idee fan in goede tiid.
To oft.	Oan oft.
I had no idea how to say anything really.	Ik hie gjin idee hoe't ik wat echt soe sizze.
I wondered how he got there.	Ik frege my ôf hoe't er sa kaam.
She comes to me.	Se komt nei my ta.
This did no good.	Dit die gjin goed.
I would say it was the best.	Ik soe sizze dat it it bêste wie.
They needed me.	Se hiene my nedich.
I felt my life.	Ik fielde my libben.
In fact, it's probably both.	Eins is it wierskynlik beide.
That just happens.	Dat bart gewoan.
That's a lot of work.	Dat is in protte wurk.
He did it.	Hy die it.
Nothing has been the same since.	Neat is sûnt itselde west.
And we come to your house too.	En wy komme ek by jo hûs.
And that child.	En dat bern.
They were still there.	Se wiene der noch.
My name is not there.	Myn namme stiet der net.

His plan worked well.	Syn plan wurke goed.
Let's do the right thing.	Litte wy it goede ding dwaan.

It's not that easy to do.	It is net sa maklik om te .
Hope your day goes well.	Hoopje dat dyn dei goed giet.
But we seem to get through it all.	Mar wy lykje te krijen troch it allegear.
He had not thought of that.	Dêr hie er net oan tocht.
But how? 	Mar hoe?
Now he's sick.	No is er siik.
I saw her do it.	Ik seach har it dwaan.
I'm an old man.	Ik bin in âld man.
It also says something about my father.	It seit ek wat oer myn heit.
Try it and see.	Besykje it en sjoch.

The things they believe.	De dingen dy't se leauwe.

Try them on for size.	Besykje se op foar grutte.
But it would not be so easy.	Mar it soe net sa maklik wêze.

I really like it.	Ik haw it echt.
I would like to know what happened in the last.	Ik wol graach witte wat der yn de lêste barde.
It's like nothing ever happened.	It is as ea neat bard.
But nothing like this happened.	Mar neat as dit barde.
Then you have something to go for or from.	Dan ha jo wat om fan of foar te gean.
The woman was her.	De frou wie har.
I do not think it would happen today.	Ik tink net dat it hjoed barre soe.
It's good he can have it.	It is goed dat hy it hawwe kin.
But, it was for the best.	Mar, it wie foar it bêste.

When it's done, you'll be glad you did.	As it dien is, sille jo bliid wêze dat jo it dien hawwe.

They love you so much.	Se hâlde safolle fan dy.
Have the same father.	Hawwe deselde heit.
There was not much more to do.	Der wie net folle mear te dwaan.
The old man is a hard man.	De âld man is in hurd man.
That might be a good thing to do.	Dat kin wol goed wêze om mei te dwaan.
That happened already.	Dat bart al.
You said you were sure.	Jo seine dat jo wis wiene.
Or how to get out of it.	Of hoe te krijen út it.
I was glad he never found him.	Ik wie bliid dat er him nea fûn.
That's not what it's about.	Dêr giet it net om.
Look around.	Sjoch om dy hinne.
I hope you are not waiting.	Ik hoopje dat jo net wachtsje.
He says it, but not tomorrow.	Hy seit doch it, mar net moarn.
They had not done so until now.	Dat hiene se oant no ta net dien.
But very good.	Mar hiel goed.
Not one bit.	Net ien bytsje.
It does not get better than that.	It wurdt net better as dat.
We were fine.	Wy wiene goed.
Very few people know the truth about him.	Hiel pear minsken witte de wierheid oer him.
Many of my friends live there.	In protte fan myn freonen wenje dêr.
I was a kind of man there.	Ik wie in soarte fan man dêr.
I never wanted any of these problems.	Ik woe noait ien fan dizze problemen.
Please let this work.	Lit dit asjebleaft wurkje.
It could never happen.	It koe nea barre.
Much, much more to come.	Folle, folle mear te kommen.
He tried to make things better.	Hy besocht dingen better te meitsjen.
She arrived on time.	Se kaam foar de tiid.
We would be in front of them then.	Wy soene har dan foar wêze.
But it did not.	Mar it hie net.
They will always be there.	Se sille der altyd wêze.
No one could say.	Nimmen koe sizze.
But what we do know is that we are in agreement here.	Mar wat wy witte is dat wy it hjir oer iens binne.
There had to be a way.	Der moast in wei komme.
Everyone wanted something from him.	Elkenien woe wat fan him.
She had seen her, of course.	Se hie har fansels sjoen.
A woman looked up at me.	In frou seach nei my op.
We want to help them.	Wy wolle har helpe.
I can not wait to be the last.	Ik kin net wachtsje om de lêste te wêzen.
Everyone is not the same.	Elkenien is net itselde.
But could not get it done in his time.	Mar koe it yn syn tiid net dien krije.
She thought he was.	Se tocht dat hy wie.
I had no idea how or when we would return.	Ik hie gjin idee hoe of wannear wy werom soene.
He waited for her to come out.	Hy wachte op har om út te kommen.
You have to do the work.	Jo moatte it wurk dwaan.
You've probably heard of it.	Jo hawwe der wierskynlik fan heard.
I have one now.	Ik haw no ien.
And you're never wrong.	En do bist noait ferkeard.
Do it right.	Doch it goed.
Let me live in your house.	Lit my wenje yn dyn hûs.
It like.	It like.
This book is different.	Dit boek is oars.
You will need it.	Jo sille it nedich hawwe.
This one was different.	Dizze wie oars.
And that did not come through me.	En dat kaam net troch my.
And help them serve.	En helpe se diene.
Her only child was my father.	Har iennichste bern wie myn heit.
Made out of what was.	Makke út wat wie.
The first class letter was not returned.	De earste klasse brief waard net werom.
I'm not the one to worry about you.	Ik bin net dejinge dy't jo soargen meitsje moatte.
There was always something.	Der wie altyd wat.
He's really happy there.	Hy is dêr echt bliid.
She would not tell anyone why.	Se soe gjinien fertelle wêrom.
It's coming back tomorrow.	It komt moarn werom.
I work hard.	Ik wurkje hurd.
She talks about everything.	Se praat oer alles.
We can not say that we will ever see that.	Wy kinne net sizze dat wy dat ea sille sjen.
I would never have done this today, of course.	Ik soe dit hjoed noait dien hawwe, fansels.
Now it was gone.	No wie it fuort.
There's the letter, child.	Dêr is de brief, bern.
To do what they want with their lives.	Om te dwaan wat se wolle mei har libben.
She had never spoken to him before.	Se hie nea earder mei him praat.
You do not want to get hurt.	Jo wolle net sear wurde.
They can not give them.	Se kinne se net jaan.
She was not afraid.	Se wie net bang.
You can tell me everything.	Jo kinne my alles fertelle.
I want someone to ride in.	Ik wol ien om yn te riden.
We would have too, if it had not.	Wy soene ek ha, as it net hie.
It will make him happy.	It sil him bliid meitsje.
I want nothing.	Ik wol neat.
And this room was no different.	En dizze keamer wie net oars.
She would work some more, and she would think.	Se soe wat mear wurkje, en se soe tinke.
Do not try to eat.	Besykje net te iten.
You can just tell by looking at them.	Jo kinne gewoan fertelle troch har te sjen.
It may take some time.	It kin in bytsje tiid nimme.
Nothing else happens.	Der bart neat oars.
Let her go then.	Lit har dan gean.
First of the year.	Earste fan it jier.
And, they could be again this year.	En, se kinne dit jier wer wêze.
He was there, of course.	Hy wie der fansels.
Everyone looked surprised.	Elkenien seach ferrast.
I give her nothing either.	Ik jou har ek neat.
I'm not sure anyone else can really.	Ik bin der net wis fan dat immen oars echt kin.
I will not tell you.	Ik sil it dy net fertelle.
And we'm sure it will.	En wy binne der wis fan dat it sil.
He thought otherwise.	Hy tocht oars.
I've see more of it tonight.	Ik sjoch der fannacht mear fan.
I did not even feel it when it happened.	Ik fielde it net iens doe't it barde.
Hy.	Hy.
I'm so tired.	Ik bin sa wurch.
I think it is.	Ik tink dat it is.
West would be no different.	West soe net oars wêze.
If it is not, that's a real problem.	As it net is, is dat in echt probleem.
She became angry.	Se waard lilk.
But since then she had heard nothing.	Mar sûnt hie se neat heard.
He hurt himself.	Hy hat himsels sear makke.
That can not be.	Dat kin net.
But it was only three days ago.	Mar it wie noch mar trije dagen lyn.
How much is this?	Hoefolle is dit?
My child's city.	Myn bern syn stêd.
Why is that? 	Wêrom is dat?
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
They know it themselves.	Se witte it sels.
He wanted to do it himself.	Hy woe dit sels dwaan.
Very well kept.	Hiel goed hâlden.
Or even there.	Of der noch by.
And then another, and another, and another.	En dan noch ien, en noch ien, en noch ien.
You were sure, very sure.	Jo wiene wis, heul wis.
That is, to this day.	Dat is, oant hjoed de dei.
There was no woman in it.	Der siet gjin frou yn.
That's what I want.	Dat winskje ik wol.
But this was my home.	Mar dit wie myn thús.
You never make anything.	Jo meitsje noait wat.
But there is only so much we can do.	Mar d'r is mar safolle dat wy kinne dwaan.
That's the problem, he stops.	Dat is it probleem, hâldt er op.
I have never been and never will be.	Ik haw noait west en sil nea wêze.
Maybe you've heard of them.	Miskien hawwe jo fan har heard.
They take money.	Se nimme jild.
So many kids here.	Safolle bern hjir.
I feel better.	Ik fiel my better.
I should not do this.	Ik soe dit net dwaan moatte.
I probably would never have read this otherwise.	Ik hie dit wierskynlik noait oars lêzen.
I did nothing but what I wanted.	Ik die neat oars as wat ik woe.
You can tell they were.	Jo kinne sizze dat se wiene.
Can not help you.	Kin dy net helpe.
I still want it.	Ik wol it noch.
You're her husband.	Do bist har man.
I, of course, do not.	Ik, fansels, net.
There's some truth in that.	Dêr sit wat wierheid yn.
I could not let that happen.	Ik koe dat net barre litte.
But you've not been here all that time.	Mar do bist hjir net west yn dy hiele tiid.
But they did not touch me at all.	Mar se rekke my hielendal net oan.
I still remember clearly that day.	Ik wit noch dúdlik dy dei.
I can now see my way out.	Ik kin no myn wei út sjen.
I'll just leave it at that.	Dat lit ik der mar by.
Never had a job my whole life.	Nea hie in baan myn hiele libben.
Think about something else.	Tink oer wat oars.
This is a beautiful party.	Dit is in moai feest.
Or you can keep it in mind.	Of jo kinne it yn hâlde.
This is the first day of my new job.	Dit is de earste dei fan myn nije baan.
My mom prepares the food.	Myn mem makket it iten klear.
My father was his best friend.	Myn heit wie syn bêste freon.
Be sure to tell all your family and friends.	Wês wis dat jo al jo famylje en freonen fertelle.
But there is enough food.	Mar der is genôch iten.
What to do.	Wat dwaan.
Please speak clearly.	Praat asjebleaft dúdlik.
It was enough, he thought.	It wie genôch, tocht er.
Tell him in bed.	Fertel him op bêd.
She heard them clearly.	Se hearde se dúdlik.
Or maybe it's just not for you.	Of miskien is it gewoan net foar jo.
His reason was a good one.	Syn reden wie in goede ien.
But it shows nothing.	Mar it lit neat sjen.
He was free.	Hy wie frij.
We do not eat just one food.	Wy ite net mar ien iten.
They seem scared of them.	Se lykje bang foar har.
He was happy for his friend.	Hy wie bliid foar syn freon.
Says we should get there and eat with him.	Seit dat wy der komme moatte en mei him ite.
I do not know how long he will be away this time.	Ik wit net hoe lang er dizze kear fuort sil.
It would all come in handy.	It soe allegear goed komme.
She knew what she wanted to say.	Se wist wat se sizze woe.
Only time can tell what will happen.	Allinnich de tiid kin fertelle wat der barre sil.
There's just no way that can ever happen.	D'r is gewoan gjin manier dat dat ea kin barre.
And someone has to pay.	En immen moat betelje.
How did he know my name.	Hoe wist er myn namme.
We now have new things to worry about.	Wy hawwe no nije dingen om ús soargen te meitsjen.
It was not too late for her to become friends again.	It wie net te let foar har om wer freonen te wurden.
And I'm nice.	En ik bin aardich.
Not together, of course.	Net tegearre, fansels.
If anyone tried to stop them, they would take care of them.	As immen besocht har tsjin te hâlden, soe se foar har soargje.
A new day is coming.	Der komt in nije dei.
It was true in a way.	It wie op in manier wier.
Make them better.	Meitsje se better.
This has been done before.	Dit is earder dien.
It found it difficult, but it could do it.	It fûn it dreech, mar it koe it dwaan.
I do not like that he looks at me like that.	Ik hâld der net fan dat er sa nei my sjocht.
In your question.	Yn jo fraach.
I found nothing.	Ik fûn neat.
Things can be done in a longer time.	Dingen kinne dien wurde yn in mear tiid.
How she knew she did not know.	Hoe't se wist wist se net.
And it has been difficult for her.	En it hat har dreech west.
Just hold on as hard as she could.	Hâld gewoan sa hurd as se koe.
It had not been difficult for him.	It hie him net dreech west.
There she is now.	Dêr is se no.
Exactly, that's who.	Krekt, dat is wa.
He became ill and could not eat.	Hy waard siik en koe net ite.
Work, and work hard.	Wurkje, en wurkje hurd.
He knows it himself.	Wit er sels fan.
Never, ever been seen.	Nea, ea sjoen wurde.
And they are always there for each other.	En se binne der altyd foar elkoar.
He leaves them open.	Hy lit se iepen bliuwe.
I think this is it.	Ik tink, dizze is.
But no one tried to do it.	Mar gjinien besocht it te dwaan.
He never gave it back.	Hy joech it noait werom.
That is very clear.	Dat is hiel dúdlik.
Tell me now.	Fertel my no.
It seemed to me like she was home again.	It like my as wie se wer thús.
She said she was not interested.	Se sei dat se net ynteressearre wie.
Have you tried this?	Hawwe jo dit besocht?
Keep them scared.	Hâld se bang.
He looked angry.	Hy seach lilk út.
I'm home at work.	Ik bin thús oan it wurk.
This seems like a good opportunity.	Dit liket in goede kâns.
So he did it.	Sa hat er it dien.
I just asked.	Ik frege krekt.
I'm scared, please help!	Ik bin bang, help asjebleaft!
It still works.	It wurket noch.
i see.	ik sjoch.
I looked around.	Ik seach om my hinne.
Do not even think about it.	Tink der net iens oer nei.
He thought she would ask him something, but she did not.	Hy tocht dat se him wat freegje soe, mar dat die se net.
And a lot of work went into this.	En in protte wurk gie yn dizze.
The woman returned home.	De frou kaam werom nei hûs.
He said he needed enough time.	Hy sei dat er genôch tiid nedich hie.
She came to him.	Se kaam by him.
I will try hard to find mine.	Ik sil hurd besykje om myn te finen.
She looked around.	Se seach om har hinne.
Maybe that's a way to save time.	Miskien is dat in manier om tiid te keapjen.
Didn't have to say anything.	Moast neat sizze.
Let's talk about money.	Lit ús prate oer jild.
All things that would not happen happened.	Alle dingen dy't net barre soene barde.
At first she could not believe it.	Earst koe se it net leauwe.
That was exactly what he had thought.	Dat wie krekt wat er tocht hie.
I never realized it.	Ik haw it noait realisearre.
But she will do well with it.	Mar se sil der wol goed mei.
He could see that it worked and he wondered how.	Hy koe sjen dat it wurke en hy frege him ôf hoe.
Not to me.	Net oan my.
I would love to give it a go.	Ik soe it graach jaan.
Really, it did.	Echt, it die.
Only one did.	Net ien die.
He hadn’t been really sure about it until now.	Hy hie it oant no ta net echt wis west.
We often eat together.	Wy hawwe faak iten tegearre.
I knew about it.	Ik wist it oer te sjen.
This was not easy for any of us.	Dit wie net maklik foar ien fan ús.
Money Talk.	Jild Praat.
I pay month to month.	Ik betelje moanne ta moanne.
We do this work every day.	Wy dogge dit wurk alle dagen.
I love that he just wants to work.	Ik hâld fan dat hy gewoan wurkje wol.
What's more, he will not do this work himself.	Wat mear is, hy sil dit wurk net sels dwaan.
Maybe that will help.	Miskien sil dat helpe.
There were these people talking.	Der wiene dizze minsken oan it praten.
He left me nothing but questions.	Hy liet my neat oars as fragen.
Now he does not want to play at all.	No wol er hielendal net spylje.
If they ever were.	As se oait wiene.
And another one under it.	En noch ien ûnder it.
And there we come.	En dêr komme wy oan.
What will be, will be.	Wat sil wêze, sil wêze.
We can not wait.	Wy kinne net wachtsje.
This did not happen.	Dit is net bard.
A house is a house.	In hûs is in hûs.
The police arrived.	De plysje kaam.
We will not be either.	Wy sille ek net wêze.
I'll see my husband.	Ik sil myn man sjen.
That set us back.	Dat sette ús werom.
The first would be our family.	De earste soe ús famylje wêze.
Then three more.	Dan noch trije.
Not at this hour of the evening.	Net op dit oere fan de jûn.
I know it can not be easy.	Ik wit dat it net maklik kin.
She looked at him.	Se seach him oan.
That's so true.	Dat is sa wier.
They were not afraid to be different.	Se wiene net bang om oars te wêzen.
It's my first day at work.	It is myn earste dei op it wurk.
I will never know.	Ik sil it noait witte.
The dog did not come.	De hûn kaam net.
Nothing else, believe me.	Neat oars, leau my.
Soon the mother started up again.	Al gau begûn de mem wer op.
I know enough.	Ik wit genôch.
Maybe her whole week.	Miskien har hiele wike.
Do everything right.	Doch alles goed.
He did not expect that.	Dat hie er net ferwachte.
This is me.	Dit bin ik.
We really need to talk.	Wy moatte echt prate.
We have to be really good at doing this.	Wy moatte echt goed wêze om dit te dwaan.
If you do not come out.	As jo ​​net komme út.
So the work goes on quickly.	Sa giet it wurk gau troch.
He would give you all the help.	Hy soe jo alle help jaan.
Everything you need is there.	Alles wat jo nedich hawwe is der.
I tried two more times.	Ik besocht noch twa kear.
All about you.	Alles oer dy.
Everyone looked at me.	Elkenien seach nei my.
And you are alone.	En do bist allinnich.
I was good to you.	Ik wie goed foar dy.
We've seen it, you've seen it.	Wy hawwe it sjoen, jo hawwe it sjoen.
I'm still scared.	Ik bin noch bang.
He felt for her for a girl.	Hy fielde har foar in famke.
It was a very good day.	It wie in tige goede dei.
I'm sorry.	Dat spyt my.
Actually, it is not quite ready yet, but maybe it is today.	Eins is it noch net hielendal klear, mar miskien is it hjoed de dei.
I'm ready to give up.	Ik bin ree om op te jaan.
They would still have a few hours.	Se soene noch in pear oeren hawwe.
I have done a lot of work for him here.	Ik haw hjir in protte wurk foar him dien.
He entered his house.	Hy kaam syn hûs yn.
Very.	Tige.
They do.	Dit dogge se.
It will tell you.	It sil dy fertelle.
But money remained a problem.	Mar jild bleau in probleem.
I'll make sure you're fine.	Ik sil der foar soargje dat jo goed binne.
She just did not know what to do with it all.	Se wist gewoan net wat se der allegear mei dwaan moast.
And it's your favorite.	En it is dyn favorite.
I had found a plan that would work.	Ik hie in plan fûn dat soe wurkje.
You tell it yourself.	Jo fertelle it sels.
No one has ever asked her.	Nimmen hat se ea frege.
Nothing happened.	Der bart neat.
He could not help it.	Hy koe it net helpe.
It still holds.	It hâldt noch.
I know exactly where you're going.	Ik wit krekt wêr't jo hinne geane.
With the children.	Mei de bern.
I do not have one of them.	Ik haw der net ien fan.
Better to do without it.	Better te dwaan sûnder it.
I got a bed.	Ik krige in bêd.
Together, at long last, forever.	Tegearre, lang om let, foar altyd.
That's the problem.	Dat is it probleem.
Ask what we can help you with.	Freegje wat wy jo kinne helpe.
As he walked.	As hy rûn.
I did not know what to do.	Ik wist net wat ik dwaan moast.
They will take care of them.	Se sille foar har soargje.
They are something else.	Se binne wat oars.
This must stop.	Dit moat ophâlde.
He will play himself.	Hy sil sels spylje.
I was not one of those people.	Ik wie net ien fan dizze minsken.
I did not feel well.	Ik fielde my net goed.
We do not need more.	Mear hawwe wy net nedich.
Then he goes back and does it.	Dan giet er werom en docht it.
In fact, she has a child.	Eins hat se in bern.
I just eat to pass the time.	Ik yt gewoan om de tiid troch te jaan.
She says you should let her go.	Se seit dat jo har gean litte moatte.
Me or your other friends.	Ik of jo oare freonen.
I have another one.	Ik haw noch ien.
She looked beautiful.	Se seach der moai út.
I'm not as hard as they say.	Ik bin net sa hurd as se sizze.
He would find no help there.	Hy soe dêr gjin help fine.
He looked tired.	Hy seach wurch.
But it was about time for him to leave.	Mar it wie oer de tiid foar him om fuort te gean.
I do not want.	Ik wol net.
The year started much like any other.	It jier begûn folle as alle oare.
He will not be home.	Hy sil net by hûs wêze.
He had me.	Hy hie my.
Not another week.	Noch in wike net.
I tried a few times.	Ik besocht in pear kear.
I often do.	Ik faak dwaan.
And that's where my problem is.	En dat is wêr't myn probleem is.
I did not go to the police.	Ik gie net nei de plysje.
It does not say.	It seit net.
She's been so nice to me.	Se is sa aardich foar my west.
Not so, my friends.	Net sa, myn freonen.
That was different.	Dat wie oars.
Even better maybe.	Noch better miskien.
Wait here, please.	Wachtsje hjir, asjebleaft.
Sick of.	Siik fan.
He was not so sure of himself.	Hy wie net sa wis fan himsels.
He can say whatever he wants.	Hy kin sizze wat er wol.
He's a really bad one.	Hy is in echt min.
It does not matter who they are or where they are.	It makket net út wa't se binne of wêr't se binne.
I want you to ask him.	Ik wol dat jo him freegje.
This will not happen.	Dit sil net barre.
You just have to see it.	Jo moatte it gewoan sjen.
But neither of us wants to be friends with her again.	Mar net ien fan ús wol wer freonen mei har.
I know where her mother is.	Ik wit wêr't har mem is.
Hard water, maybe.	Hurd wetter, miskien.
If you do not want to do that.	As jo ​​dat net wolle dwaan.
This was not what she thought she ever wanted.	Dit wie net wat se tocht dat se ea woe.
Why not do it again ?.	Wêrom net wer dwaan?.
But today it is not easy.	Mar hjoed is it net maklik.
I'll see you soon.	Ik sjoch dy gau.
Well, money is not everything.	No, jild is net alles.
He's pretty sick, he is.	Hy is aardich siik, hy is.
I think it was.	Ik tink dat it wie.
I saw this a lot.	Ik seach dit in protte.
We can and should not.	Wy kinne en moatte net.
There is so much more to life than food.	D'r is safolle mear yn it libben as iten.
Many people have children.	In protte minsken hawwe bern.
She walked away without saying a word.	Se gie fuort sûnder in wurd te praten.
An out is an out is an out.	In út is in út is in út.
I can not believe no one would help.	Ik kin net leauwe dat gjinien soe helpe.
And he was a good friend.	En hy wie in goede freon.
I let them do that.	Ik lit se dat dwaan.
They do not have to be afraid.	Se hoege net bang te wêzen.
This is our father.	Dit is ús heit.
They talk through us.	Se prate troch ús hinne.
But it will take hard work and time.	Mar it sil hurd wurk en tiid nimme.
Tell her.	Fertel har.
Back, please.	Werom, asjebleaft.
I've ever bought you so many.	Ik haw dy oait safolle kocht.
It was his job.	It wie syn wurk.
But you know them.	Mar jo witte se.
You know why you are like that.	Jo witte wêrom't jo sa binne.
They talk and walk away.	Se prate en gean fuort.
Maybe you've seen this one.	Miskien hawwe jo dizze sjoen.
They do not know they have a little more.	Se witte net dat se in bytsje mear hawwe.
It's not there.	It is der net.
He was just a problem.	Hy wie gewoan in probleem.
The moon soon rose.	De moanne kaam gau op.
She had seen it, and asked me what was going on.	Se hie it sjoen, en frege my wat der oan de hân wie.
I also know she needs you.	Ik wit ek dat se dy nedich hat.
But never let him get the last word.	Mar lit him noait it lêste wurd krije.
Now we do not need you anymore.	No hawwe wy dy net mear nedich.
But they have to.	Mar se moatte.
They work for our people, care so much for us.	Se wurkje foar ús minsken, soargje safolle foar ús.
Think long and hard.	Tink lang en hurd.
It was his city.	It wie syn stêd.
He wanted to have something to say when he saw them.	Hy woe wat te sizzen hawwe doe't er se seach.
Be sure of that.	Wês der wis fan.
She lives across from me.	Se wennet foar my oer.
You say you do not want this.	Jo sizze dat jo dit net wolle.
I could be a teacher.	Ik soe learaar wêze kinne.
We want to help you.	Wy wolle jo helpe.
I tried to read something.	Ik besocht wat te lêzen.
We are three of them.	Wy binne trije fan har.
The police had arrived.	De plysje wie kommen.
It's this or nothing.	It is dit of neat.
And even this was never certain.	En ek dit wie nea wis.
Well, for us.	No, foar ús.
There was nothing for the man.	Der wie neat foar de man.
It will happen.	It sil barre.
I'm coming.	Ik kom der oan.
He had the house.	Hy hie it hûs.
To say nothing about me.	Om neat oer my te sizzen.
That's just too long.	Dat is gewoan te lang.
They do not want you to know anything about them.	Se wolle net dat jo wat oer har witte.
He did not make her angry.	Hy makke har net lilk.
But, somehow, does.	Mar, op ien of oare manier, docht.
We had been to the same school.	Wy hiene op deselde skoalle west.
I would not believe it at all.	Ik soe it hielendal net leauwe.
We agree that everything was fine.	Wy binne it iens dat alles goed wie.
That was all he had to say.	Dat hie er mar sizze moatten.
He's been here a long time.	Hy wie hjir al lang.
There was enough time to leave.	Der wie genôch tiid om fuort te gean.
I'm definitely a good friend.	Ik bin wis in goede freon.
I'm back to work.	Ik bin wer oan it wurk.
Someone needs to know.	Immen moat it witte.
She's a good person.	Se is in goed persoan.
There were some kids who didn’t get what the evening was about.	Der wiene wat bern dy't net krigen wat de jûn oer gie.
It's pretty good in there.	Dêr is it aardich goed yn.
It's hard to be around you.	It is dreech om om dy hinne te wêzen.
He wants to help her.	Hy wol har helpe.
Lots more money.	In protte mear jild.
None of that is the problem.	Gjin fan dat is it probleem.
It happens that we seem to have that wrong.	It bart dat wy lykje te hawwen dat ferkeard.
She doesn't even really look at him.	Se sjocht net iens echt nei him.
This was it.	Dit wie it.
Or wait until tomorrow.	Of wachtsje oant moarn.
That should not be a problem.	Dat soe gjin probleem wêze moatte.
Now he had to stay in the car.	No moast er op 'e auto bliuwe.
There can be no more.	Der kin net mear.
Nothing had to.	Neat moast.
If you have any problems, please contact me.	As jo ​​​​problemen hawwe, gean jo nei my.
That will do for now.	Dat sil foar no dwaan.
He saw it too.	Hy seach it ek.
There would be a better time.	Der soe in bettere tiid wêze.
How did he know?	Hoe moast er it witte?
It does not work.	It wurket net.
I'm so sorry.	Dat spyt my tige.
You are so needed.	Jo binne sa nedich.
Nothing of the sort.	Neat fan it soarte.
I think there's something you want from me.	Ik tink dat d'r wat is dat jo fan my wolle.
Nothing to eat.	Neat te iten.
No one came to see what happened.	Der kaam net ien om te sjen wat der barde.
She can help here.	Se kin hjir helpe.
Many of us find it so.	In protte fan ús fine it sa.
You probably do not.	Jo wierskynlik net.
It was not really a house.	It wie net echt in hûs.
Neither of us had.	Net ien fan ús hie.
I found it clear where the book was going.	Ik fûn it dúdlik wêr't it boek hinne gie.
The couple has three children.	It pear hat trije bern.
On and on and on.	Oan en oan en oan.
It seemed that his friend did not.	It like dat syn freon net die.
Let them not win.	Lit se net winne.
I had to get out of here right away.	Ik moast hjir fuort fuort.
I know where everyone lives.	Ik wit wêr't elkenien wennet.
It was the last one.	It wie de lêste.
I would do more.	Ik soe mear dwaan.
What you say is true.	Wat jo sizze is wier.
That's her job.	Dat is har wurk.
He just sat there.	Hy siet der mar.
I was just not ready.	Ik wie gewoan net klear.
That we needed everyone.	Dat wy hiene elkenien nedich.
Whatever you think.	Wat jo ek tinke.
I can not get in there yet.	Ik kin der noch net yn.
Talking about the past was difficult.	Prate oer it ferline wie dreech.
Have a child.	Hawwe in bern.
I'll be gone in a week.	Ik sil oer in wike fuort wêze.
It was better, but needed even more time.	It wie better, mar hie noch mear tiid nedich.
He just asked him how she was.	Hy frege him gewoan ôf hoe't se wie.
It will hurt to go under.	It sil sear dwaan om ûnder te gean.
And what's more, it's been three days since this happened.	En wat mear is, it is trije dagen lyn dat dit barde.
She was not sure what she was going to do.	Se wie der net wis fan wat se dwaan soe.
But I want to make it better.	Mar ik wol it better meitsje.
We will eat together.	Wy sille tegearre ite.
I'm buying that picture.	Ik keapje dy foto.
He looked even more like his father.	Hy like noch mear op syn heit.
We have work to do.	Wy hawwe wurk te dwaan.
She had done everything she could do.	Se hie alles dien wat se dwaan koe.
The next time he said to himself.	De oare kear sei er tsjin himsels.
But it's getting late.	Mar it wurdt let.
It seems clear to us that there is.	It liket ús dúdlik dat der is.
It would happen.	It soe barre.
I do not know what will happen.	Ik wit net wat der barre sil.
We do not know what they want.	Wy witte net wat se wolle.
I was there though.	Ik wie der wol.
That will never happen of course.	Dat sil nea barre fansels.
He has known me my whole life.	Hy ken my myn hiele libben.
That's all gone.	Dat alles is fuort.
Nobody does.	Nimmen docht.
But for me, it was just fine.	Mar foar my wie it krekt goed.
Will try it.	Sil it besykje.
Just a little.	Krekt in bytsje.
I had not heard that.	Dat hie ik net heard.
I do not have time to be sick.	Ik ha gjin tiid om siik te wêzen.
I liked her.	Ik mocht har graach.
Look for him.	Sjoch foar him.
So much happened.	Der barde safolle.
Now we've got it.	No hawwe wy it krigen.
You too .	Do ek .
One is never enough.	Ien is nea genôch.
I'm happy to stay.	Ik bin bliid om te bliuwen.
You have a problem now!	Jo hawwe no in probleem!
Let's go back to the room and get ready.	Litte wy werom nei de keamer en meitsje ús klear.
He was tall.	Hy wie lang.
There's nothing one of us could do.	D'r is neat dat ien fan ús koe dwaan.
I never heard a single angry word from him.	Ik hearde nea ien lilk wurd út him.
I have been.	Ik haw west.
He's scared.	Hy is bang.
We need to work to do the same.	Wy moatte wurkje om itselde te dwaan.
I want to talk about you.	Ik wol it oer dy hawwe.
Kids these days !.	Bern dizze dagen!.
He was not sure who she was.	Hy wie net wis wa't se wie.
They do not pay them enough.	Se betelje har net genôch.
That would not happen.	Dat soe net barre.
You have to be good at it.	Jo moatte der goed yn wêze.
She just will not give up.	Se sil gewoan net jaan.
They ask where we are coming from.	Se freegje wêr't wy wei komme.
You're still here for a reason.	Jo binne hjir noch foar in reden.
He was late again today.	Hy wie hjoed wer te let.
He had nothing to say to her.	Hy hie neat te sizzen tsjin har.
The only way out of this place.	De ienige manier út dit plak.
I did something wrong.	Ik haw wat ferkeard dien.
He saw the opportunity.	Hy seach de kâns.
Or so she had thought.	Of dat hie se tocht.
You will probably win.	Jo sille wierskynlik winne.
I'm the best.	Ik bin de bêste.
The boy walked over to him.	De jonge rûn nei him ta.
No one had a name.	Nimmen hie gjin namme.
She could not leave.	Se koe net fuort.
She went straight home.	Se gie fuort nei hûs.
Do not sit at the door like that.	Sit net sa by de doar.
I will never be so happy like this again.	Ik sil noait wer sa bliid wêze as dit.
If she got help, it would not be from him.	As se help krige, soe it net fan him wêze.
Maybe she should stop, she said.	Miskien moat se ophâlde, sei se.
It's out.	It is út.
They had two children together.	Se krigen twa bern tegearre.
You are so good at talking about everything.	Jo binne sa goed om oer alles te praten.
I do not know exactly.	Ik wit it net krekt.
Long and easy.	Lang om let.
They come home after the party.	Se komme nei it feest thús.
No one else can do it for you.	Nimmen oars kin it foar jo dwaan.
In fact, she was not sure if it had been three days.	Eins wie se net wis oft it trije dagen west hie.
But the truth is, everything is going badly.	Mar de wierheid is dat alles min giet.
As husband and wife.	As man en frou.
They are just beautiful.	Se binne gewoan moai.
He is with her.	Hy is by har.
she says.	seit se.
He had to ask the way back twice.	Hy moast der twa kear de wei werom freegje.
Neither happened here.	Gjin fan beide barde hjir.
Add them a little.	Meitsje se in bytsje oan.
He could not leave.	Hy koe net fuort.
I do not even feel so bad.	Ik fiel my net iens sa min.
I know people do.	Ik wit dat minsken dogge.
He was really nice, she said.	Hy wie echt aardich, sei se.
That would be nice.	Dat soe moai wêze.
There is no way around it.	Der is gjin wei om it hinne.
It's time for bed.	It is tiid foar bêd.
I want to know.	Ik wol it witte.
This can actually hurt.	Dit kin eins sear dwaan.
And we keep doing, and we will never stop.	En wy bliuwe te dwaan, en wy sille nea ophâlde.
At home, at school.	Thús, op skoalle.
But only for himself.	Mar allinnich foar himsels.
One seat was waiting for him.	Ien sit wachte op him.
It will not be his last, but he does not know it yet.	It sil syn lêste net wêze, mar hy wit it noch net.
I do not want to be there.	Ik wol der net by wêze.
No problems of any kind.	Gjin problemen fan hokker soarte.
First time without the kids.	Earste kear sûnder de bern.
He had not yet said his last words to the family.	Hy hie syn lêste wurden noch net sein tsjin de famylje.
Maybe she had not seen it at all.	Miskien hie se it hielendal net sjoen.
I do not feel well, somehow.	Ik fiel my net goed, op ien of oare manier.
They decided to do this.	Se besletten dit te dwaan.
But then he walks away.	Mar dan giet er fuort.
Or maybe not for you.	Of miskien net foar jo.
He did not say it.	Hy sei it net.
I did not look after anyone.	Ik seach gjinien om.
He woke up for tomorrow.	Hy waard wekker foar moarn.
None of us can.	Net ien fan ús kin.
Otherwise he does nothing.	Oars docht er neat.
But he had not been home for a long time.	Mar hy wie al lang net thús.
We no longer love each other.	Wy hâlde net mear fan elkoar.
That house must be very old though.	Dat hûs moat wol hiel âld wêze.
Life seemed to come back to haunt him.	It libben like him werom te kommen.
Not to me.	Net oan my.
You've been here before, haven't you?	Jo hawwe hjir earder west, net?
He showed something but it was not enough.	Hy liet wat sjen mar it wie net genôch.
She knew how to talk to her.	Se wist mei har te praten.
But in one way it did.	Mar op ien manier die it.
They were my friends.	Se wiene myn freonen.
We can go to bed if you want.	Wy kinne op bêd as jo wolle.
They are not and never will be.	Se binne net en sille nea wêze.
It's bad and it's going to be hard for us.	It is min en it sil dreech wurde foar ús.
See what happens.	Sjoch wat der bart.
Everyone has been here.	Elkenien hat hjir west.
Could not give him what he asked for.	Koe him net jaan wat er frege.
There was some truth in that.	Der siet wat wierheid yn.
It should not be done.	It moat net dien wurde.
You can eat well in the city.	Jo kinne yn 'e stêd goed ite.
I'll buy you a new bike.	Ik sil dy in nije fyts keapje.
There was only one chance left.	Der wie mar ien kâns oer.
You are everything to me.	Do bist alles foar my.
No word yet.	Noch gjin wurd.
But there is a reason why they are no longer there.	Mar der is in reden wêrom't se der net mear binne.
He did it.	Hy hat it dien.
Never could get in there.	Nea koe der yn komme.
But this time the mother was ready.	Mar dizze kear wie de mem klear.
But you convinced me.	Mar do hast my oertsjûge.
No problem, of course.	Gjin probleem, fansels.
That would not do at all.	Dat soe hielendal net dwaan.
I'm hoping for good things.	Ik hoopje op goede dingen.
She had done that.	Dat hie se dien.
I had them both.	Ik hie se beide.
I have often thought about what it would be like.	Ik haw faak tocht oer hoe't it wêze soe.
Of course, this is not true.	Fansels is dit net wier.
It was a very enjoyable read.	It wie in heul leuk lêzen.
It was more than okay with her.	It wie mear as goed mei har.
He was afraid of not doing it.	Hy wie bang om it net te dwaan.
This was for real.	Dit wie foar echt.
Maybe she would be better off without him.	Miskien soe se better sûnder him wêze.
Whether you will like him or not.	Of jo sille him leuk fine of net.
I felt the same.	Ik fielde itselde.
It's not just me who thinks that.	It is net allinnich ik dy't tink dat.
The problem occurs here.	It probleem komt hjir foar.
But wait.	Mar wachtsje.
The two friends do not talk much.	De beide freonen prate net folle.
I can not do this.	Ik kin dit net dwaan.
I can not pay it.	Ik kin it net betelje.
There it is.	Dêr is it.
I had not asked for this.	Ik hie hjir net om frege.
No one can tell you when, either.	Nimmen kin jo fertelle wannear, ek.
There was not much to it.	Der wie net folle oan.
He did not seem to talk about it.	Hy like der net oer te praten.
I was not really happy.	Ik wie net echt bliid.
Anyone can see that.	Elkenien kin dat sjen.
This had no one.	Dit hie gjinien.
Those are his words.	Dat binne syn wurden.
They knew what he did not, what about himself.	Se wisten wat er net, wat oer himsels.
Everyone is so nice.	Elkenien is sa aardich.
But you are among friends.	Mar jo binne ûnder freonen.
We want to reach more people.	Wy wolle by mear minsken komme.
But that's wrong.	Mar dat is ferkeard.
Are you sure you know what you are doing?	Binne jo wis dat jo witte wat jo dogge?
That was not so good.	Dat wie net sa goed.
And saw what he expected.	En seach wat er ferwachte.
Of course, she never said that when my dad was there.	Fansels hat se dat noait sein doe't myn heit der wie.
Just talking to my mom.	Krekt praat mei myn mem.
It's my job.	It is myn wurk.
I want to say something.	Ik wol wat sizze.
We visit someone when he is sick.	Wy besykje ien as er siik is.
Maybe, maybe we can.	Miskien, miskien kinne wy.
They want nothing but the best for you.	Se wolle neat oars as it bêste foar jo.
I have been trying to find a new job.	Ik ha besocht in nije baan te finen.
This is what it looks like.	Dit is wat it liket.
He could not get the name so well.	Hy koe net sa goed oan de namme komme.
He also has no time.	Hy hat ek gjin tiid.
He was still only thirty years old.	Hy wie noch mar tritich jier âld.
I'm going to him.	Ik gean nei him ta.
Not a bit.	Net in bytsje.
He should never have won and he knows it.	Hy hie nea winne moatten en hy wit it.
They were told up to a week.	Se wiene oant in wike ferteld.
If you get a chance, that is.	As jo ​​​​in kâns krije, dat is.
Did not say where.	Sei net wêr't.
That's what she says.	Dat seit se.
But this room will not do.	Mar dizze keamer sil net dwaan.
We have no food.	Wy hawwe gjin iten.
Just started.	Krekt begûn.
My work can be seen here and here.	Myn wurk is hjir en hjir te sjen.
You never came to me again.	Do bist noait wer by my kaam.
That will do.	Dat sil dwaan.
She felt like she really could not walk.	Se fielde as koe se echt net gean.
My first and last and only.	Myn earste en lêste en ienige.
It's probably bad.	It is wierskynlik min.
I'm been away for a week or so.	Ik bin in wike as wat fuort.
That is not enough.	Dat is net genôch.
He does not actually do these things himself.	Hy docht dizze dingen eins net sels.
Now it does not.	No docht it net.
He likes being in his room.	Hy is graach yn syn keamer.
She needs to know.	Se moat it witte.
And look at this place.	En sjoch nei dit plak.
Talk to him first.	Praat earst mei him.
Tell your mom where you're going.	Fertel jo mem wêr't jo hinne geane.
My husband does not even want me to do that.	Myn man wol net iens dat ik dat doch.
But not as before.	Mar net as earder.
They try, but it does not work.	Se besykje, mar it wurket net.
I look more like my father than my mother.	Ik lykje mear op myn heit as op myn mem.
And so everything works fine.	En sa wurket alles goed.
I doubt they would want that if they could.	Ik twifelje dat se dat wolle as se koene.
That's what you told me.	Dat hawwe jo my sein.
I let myself out.	Ik lit my út.
I told him we needed more money.	Ik fertelde him dat wy mear jild nedich wiene.
I do not know what is what.	Ik wit net wat wat is.
But for him that did not matter.	Mar foar him hoegde dat net.
Let me try it another way.	Lit my it op in oare manier besykje.
Please go, now.	Gean asjebleaft, no.
You know there's a very good reason for that.	Jo witte dat d'r in heul goede reden foar is.
There are a lot of people.	Der binne in protte minsken.
You also have to work.	Jo moatte ek wurkje.
I had to find him.	Ik moast him fine.
You do not have to be afraid.	Jo moatte net bang wêze.
You can have as many as you want.	Jo kinne safolle hawwe as jo wolle.
But now there was something else.	Mar no wie der wat oars.
I do not want to do that.	Dat wol ik net dwaan.
I see why people want them that way.	Ik sjoch wêrom't minsken har sa wolle.
They are available.	Se binne te krijen.
For as long as they want.	Foar sa lang as se wolle.
I have no idea how that happened, but it has.	Ik haw gjin idee hoe't dat bard is, mar it hat.
She was beautiful last night.	Se wie moai fannacht.
Maybe we could stay there.	Miskien koene wy ​​dêr bliuwe.
I'm looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der goed nei.
It had been a bad weekend for him.	It hie in min wykein foar him west.
The children were ready for bed.	De bern wiene klear foar bêd.
Today it does.	Hjoed docht it.
She should have said nothing.	Se hie neat sizze moatten.
As my friend.	As myn freon.
A few days.	In pear dagen.
We never say that.	Dat sizze wy noait.
She does not seem to be afraid.	Se liket net bang te wêzen.
She has no children.	Se hat gjin bern.
Or maybe not his.	Of miskien net syn.
But he thought better of it.	Mar hy tocht der better oer.
We're waiting to see who will win.	Wy wachtsje ôf wa't winne soe.
It's going well with her now.	It komt no goed mei har.
I wondered what the problem was.	Ik frege my ôf wat it probleem wie.
There is nothing to do now.	Der is no neat oan te dwaan.
There needs to be more to it.	Der moat mear oan.
All or nothing, he said.	Alles of neat, sei er.
Have it ready for dinner on time.	Hawwe it op 'e tiid klear foar it iten.
He knows you are not what he wants you to be.	Hy wit dat jo net binne wat hy wol.
See what happened.	Sjoch wat der bard is.
How nice!	Wat aardich!
Someone should have told you that to me.	Immen hie it dy foar my fertelle moatten.
There is so much to do.	Der is safolle te dwaan.
Which of course it had.	Wat it fansels hie.
I'm just a man.	Ik bin allinnich in man.
Forever and ever.	Foar altyd en altyd.
I think we can all agree on that.	Ik tink dat wy it dêr allegear mei iens wêze kinne.
It does not say that both must be true.	It seit net dat beide wier wêze moatte.
No one who knew her was surprised.	Nimmen dy't har koe wie ferrast.
This can be so beautiful for them.	Dit kin sa moai foar har wêze.
But he thought they would be his.	Mar hy tocht dat se fan him wêze soene.
He did not want to come here.	Hy woe hjir net komme.
He saw what had happened.	Hy seach wat der bard wie.
I am sorry.	It spyt my.
Do not tell her.	Fertel it har net.
Maybe she had not come.	Miskien wie se net kommen.
Or what he thought would make him happy.	Of wat er tocht dat him bliid meitsje soe.
Three, she thought.	Trije, tocht se.
I have two concerns.	Ik haw twa soargen.
Let her be happy.	Lit har bliid wêze.
No one would ever give me a job again.	Nimmen soe my oait wer in baan jaan.
That's really good to see.	Dat is echt goed om te sjen.
He sat in there.	Hy siet der yn.
Maybe you like it a lot.	Miskien liket dy in protte.
None of these things are true.	Gjin fan dizze dingen is wier.
They are so beautiful.	Se binne sa moai.
He stands at the door.	Hy stiet by de doar.
Look for us there.	Sjoch foar ús dêr.
We are friends, of a kind.	Wy binne freonen, fan in soarte.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Fertel my asjebleaft.
I'm just going to bed.	Ik gean mar op bêd.
I'm doing something back.	Ik doch wat werom.
He became angry.	Hy waard lilk.
It was over last week.	It wie ferline wike oer.
There is not much else to do.	Der is net folle oars te dwaan.
That would be difficult.	Dat soe dreech wêze.
Neither.	Ek net.
No one can do it for us.	Nimmen kin it foar ús dwaan.
I must have done something right.	Ik moat wat goed dien hawwe.
That's who you are.	Dat is wa't jo binne.
He was very angry.	Hy wie tige lilk.
You ask for nothing.	Jo freegje neat.
I do not want to stay in this house.	Ik wol net yn dit hûs bliuwe.
He is the best in this city.	Hy is de bêste yn dizze stêd.
I wanna go.	Ik wol gean.
I know you're not coming.	Ik wit dat jo net komme.
The next day.	De folgjende dei.
You are too.	Do bist ek.
Now what to do ?.	No wat te meitsjen?.
I was almost not.	Ik wie hast net.
I'm a friend of your mother.	Ik bin in freon fan dyn mem.
I could not get to him.	Ik koe net by him komme.
I tried.	Ik besocht.
It felt like the right thing for him.	It fielde as it goede ding foar him.
But, it still did not work.	Mar, it wurke noch altyd net.
It's all right now.	It is no alles.
The past is too much with me.	It ferline is te folle mei my.
I'm ok.	It giet goed mei my.
That's the whole thing.	Dat is it hiele ding.
And look at her.	En sjoch har.
They say they are not afraid of anything.	Se sizze dat se net bang binne foar neat.
Go check it out.	Gean der nei sjen.
And he hurt me.	En hy wie sear foar my.
There is no such thing as easy work.	Der is net sa'n ding as maklik wurk.
I really like going.	Ik gean hiel graach.
It never goes away.	It giet noait fuort.
His mother showed him what to do.	Syn mem liet him sjen wat er dwaan moast.
I do not think so.	Ik tink dat se net.
It could not be true.	It koe net wier wêze.
I'm interested to see more.	Ik bin ynteressearre om mear te sjen.
She could see it in him.	Se koe it oan him sjen.
Will it be made?	Sil it makke wurde?
But with this, it was different.	Mar mei dizze wie it oars.
Maybe he would try that one day.	Miskien soe er dat op in dei besykje.
I did not know if you would come.	Ik wist net oft jo komme soene.
And we have work to do.	En wy hawwe wurk te dwaan.
No one was interested.	Nimmen wie ynteressearre.
If I could have that day back.	As ik dy dei werom ha koe.
You get what you work for.	Jo krije wêr't jo foar wurkje.
You and my time may still be long.	Jo en myn tiid kin noch lang wêze.
Then back home.	Dan wer thús.
You say he did wrong.	Jo sizze dat hy ferkeard dien hat.
He would help find her father.	Hy soe helpe har heit te finen.
I can make this work for you.	Ik kin dit wurk foar jo meitsje.
He ran and ran.	Hy rûn en rûn.
This time he did not return.	Dizze kear kaam er net werom.
Take them out of the house every now and then.	Nim se sa no en dan út it hûs.
It's hard to do everything.	It is dreech om alles te dwaan.
Help! 	Help!
help! 	help!
I can not win this.	Ik kin dit net winne.
Once in three it works like this.	Ien kear yn de trije wurket it sa.
It ran away when it saw us.	It rûn fuort doe't it ús seach.
He can not eat well.	Hy kin net goed ite.
I had my whole family out there.	Ik hie myn hiele famylje út dêr.
She came home late.	Se kaam let thús.
A few actually are.	In pear eins binne.
New every day.	Nije alle dagen.
He asked where they were.	Hy frege wêr't se wiene.
I have none of those.	Ik haw gjin ien fan dy.
I was not ready for this.	Ik wie net klear foar dit.
Tried but did not know how to help us.	Besocht mar wist net hoe te helpen ús.
They should not be.	Se moatte net wêze.
In fact, she was very scared of him.	Eins wie se tige bang foar him.
That's the reason.	Dat is de reden.
Nothing she could do now.	Neat koe se no dwaan.
There's no way to get there.	D'r is gjin manier om der hinne te kommen.
I will help her.	Ik sil har helpe.
Show, not tell.	Lit sjen, net fertelle.
He was always good with children.	Hy wie altyd goed mei bern.
They keep it nice.	Se hâlde it moai.
And you probably know his name.	En jo witte wierskynlik syn namme.
This is not very common.	Dit is net hiel gewoan.
That was when her best friend ran out.	Dat wie doe't har bêste freon rûn út.
He volunteered to help.	Hy joech him oan om te helpen.
He did not enter the house.	Hy kaam net yn it hûs.
It was not.	It wie net.
I was wrong.	Ik hie it ferkeard.
I'm the only one she can talk to about this.	Ik bin de iennichste mei wa se hjir oer prate kin.
That's what we do.	Dat is wat wy dogge.
To be seen.	Sjoen wurde.
In fact, he always had.	Eins hie er altyd.
Of course, this would be a better place.	Fansels soe dit in better plak wêze.
But here you are again.	Mar hjir binne jo wer.
This is not my home.	Dit is myn thús net.
Well, I do not.	No, ik net.
Long for you.	Lang foar dy.
Your friends were talking about it.	Jo freonen hiene it der oer.
He's very busy and has no time for that.	Hy hat it tige drok en hat hjir gjin tiid foar.
It's in your making.	It is yn jo meitsjen.
I do this and that every day.	Ik doch dit en dat alle dagen.
Whatever her name is.	Wat har namme ek is.
Think about everything you have.	Tink oer alles wat jo hawwe.
Do not let it let you know anything about it.	Lit it net litte dat jo hjir wat fan witte.
This was great time.	Dit wie grutte tiid.
When did this happen?	Wannear barde dit?
We had everything we needed and more.	Wy hiene alles wat wy nedich wiene en mear.
So was his mother.	Sa wie syn mem.
We do not have much time.	Wy hawwe net folle tiid.
The idea is wrong.	It idee is ferkeard.
And maybe they are.	En miskien binne se.
It was better to say it never happened.	It wie better om te sizzen dat it noait bard is.
She had been away for three years.	Se wie al trije jier fuort.
I should have told my kids.	Ik hie myn bern fertelle moatten.
There may be a way.	Der kin in manier wêze.
She had come for that.	Dêr wie se foar kommen.
Come on, let's go home.	Kom, lit ús nei hûs gean.
I don't think so.	Ik tink it net.
It felt that way.	It fielde sa.
There they come back to me.	Dêr komme se by my op werom.
But maybe it was.	Mar miskien wie it wol.
Enough, actually to see it twice today.	Genôch, eins om it hjoed twa kear te sjen.
She looked around the room.	Se seach de keamer om.
We decided not to go.	Wy hawwe besletten net te gean.
Let's take this one by one.	Lit ús dizze ien foar ien nimme.
I asked for help.	Ik frege om help.
I just wanted to be sure.	Ik woe gewoan wis wêze.
Or you can stay exactly where you are.	Of jo kinne krekt bliuwe wêr't jo binne.
Anyone who wants it.	Elkenien dy't it wol.
It will help you to get it in hand.	It sil jo helpe om it yn 'e hân te krijen.
I'll come along, he said.	Ik kom mei, sei er.
I really think this is the only way.	Ik tink echt dat dit de ienige manier is.
Or whatever you want.	Of wat jo wolle.
I know it's real.	Ik wit dat it echt is.
I was just doing it to pass such time.	Ik wie it gewoan te dwaan om sa'n tiid troch te jaan.
It is not necessary.	It is net nedich.
I do not know how this happened.	Ik wit net hoe't dit bard is.
Everyone agreed now.	Elkenien wie it no iens.
We are not talking.	Wy prate net.
He just told you.	Hy hat dy krekt ferteld.
And that will not stop.	En dat sil net ophâlde.
It was this morning.	It wie no moarn.
It's just not me.	It is gewoan net ik.
They want the money.	Se wolle it jild.
It was right here in this office.	It wie krekt hjir yn dit kantoar.
But just for today.	Mar krekt foar hjoed.
That being said, we need to see where it goes.	As it wurdt sein, wy moatte sjen wêr't it giet.
She knew he wanted her too.	Se wist dat er har ek woe.
It was so.	It wie sa.
I told her she had nothing to do.	Ik fertelde har dat se neat hoegde te dwaan.
Tried nothing.	Hat neat besocht.
No time was given.	Gjin tiid waard jûn.
It is the faith itself that is wrong.	It is it leauwe sels dat ferkeard is.
Been here all that time.	Hjir al dy tiid west.
He even thought of eating it.	Hy tocht sels oan om it te iten.
People know that too.	Dat witte de minsken ek.
I like sitting here.	Ik sit hjir graach.
I'm sure you believe everything you say.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo leauwe alles wat jo sizze.
Do you want to go to the city?	Wolle jo nei de stêd?
He said he wanted to buy it.	Hy sei dat er it keapje woe.
What food was left over.	Wat iten bleau oer.
But you have.	Mar jo hawwe.
Day two was no better.	Dei twa wie net better.
Almost no one knew about you.	Hast gjinien wist oer dy.
She had seen him twice before.	Se hie him twa kear earder sjoen.
She did not know where to go.	Se wist net wêr't se hinne moast.
You're worried.	Jo binne soargen.
But, you should do it really well.	Mar, jo soene it echt goed dwaan moatte.
My mom looks old.	Myn mem sjocht der âld út.
It was not entirely true, of course.	It wie net hielendal wier, fansels.
The truth made up for it.	De wierheid makke der ta.
Of course it was not.	Fansels wie it net.
They had seen a bad thing.	Se hiene in min ding sjoen.
We do this every day.	Wy dogge dit alle dagen.
Not sure what they will be.	Net wis wat se sille wêze.
She was my friend.	Se wie myn freon.
I'll tell you.	Ik sil it dy sizze.
Here there was much more.	Hjir wie der folle mear.
But he could not get it there either.	Mar hy koe it dêr ek net krije.
The way of things.	De manier fan dingen.
She did not know what else to do.	Se wist net wat se oars dwaan moast.
Not if we really believe what we think we are.	Net as wy echt leauwe wat wy tinke dat wy binne.
None of us can go home now.	Net ien fan ús kin no nei hûs.
My Life is an open book.	Myn libben is in iepen boek.
No one is coming.	Der komt gjinien.
I love having it on me.	Ik hâld fan it hawwen op my.
It's more from my past.	It is mear út myn ferline.
I thought it had been there forever.	Ik tocht dat it der foar altyd west hie.
His life, the lives of his children, where they have been and where they are going.	Syn libben, it libben fan syn bern, wêr't se west hawwe en wêr't se hinne geane.
From my 'better' days.	Fan myn 'bettere' dagen.
Clearly there was something going on.	Dúdlik wie der wat oan de hân.
But you love him.	Mar jo hâlde fan him.
And no one can tell you where.	En nimmen kin jo fertelle wêr.
Life was like that.	It libben wie sa.
I have no idea what the problem is here.	Ik ha gjin idee wat it probleem hjir is.
He was so kind to give it to me.	Hy wie sa aardich om it my te jaan.
Your hair looks good.	Jo hier sjocht der goed út.
Somehow that was different.	Op ien of oare manier wie dat oars.
She likes you when you like her.	Se graach dy as jo like se.
It does not have to do that.	It hoecht it net te dwaan.
No mother is.	Gjin mem is.
We do not take that away.	Dat nimme wy net fuort.
More than anything, she wanted him gone.	Mear as alles woe se him fuort.
If she had started there, it might have been different.	As se dêr begûn wie, hie it miskien oars west.
Nothing like this.	Neat as dit.
And, you felt something.	En, do fielde wat.
This will work.	Dit sil wurkje.
You're a young woman.	Do bist in jonge frou.
Easy as making friends.	Maklik as freonen meitsje.
You do not know her name.	Jo witte har namme net.
They were like our family.	Se wiene as ús famylje.
I've never tried it.	Ik haw it noait besocht.
She kept looking away.	Se bleau fuort te sjen.
That we decided just enough was enough.	Dat wy besletten gewoan genôch wie genôch.
It's fun, but it's a lot.	It is leuk, mar it wurdt in protte.
He did not know what.	Hy wist net wat.
On her ride.	Op har riden.
Those there.	Dy dêr.
I still could not believe this was happening.	Ik koe noch net leauwe dat dit bart.
What do you think of this book?	Wat fine jo fan dit boek?
There was no one else.	Der wie gjinien oars.
If you have any questions, ask.	As jo ​​fragen hawwe, freegje.
My parents were the same.	Myn âlden wiene itselde.
For one thing, you probably would not believe me.	Foar ien ding soene jo my wierskynlik net leauwe.
Everyone heard it.	Elkenien hearde it.
I'm just here.	Ik bin hjir gewoan.
I think everyone should too !.	Ik tink dat elkenien ek moat!.
He's coming home.	Hy komt thús.
He will do anything to get back with her, even playing sick.	Hy sil alles dwaan om mei har werom te kommen, sels siik spylje.
I was pretty sure everyone knew.	Ik wie frij wis dat elkenien wist.
Ask if she will see you.	Freegje oft se dy sil sjen.
Can't wait tonight.	Kin net wachtsje fannacht.
They are long gone.	Se binne al lang fuort.
More than surprised.	Mear as ferrast.
And we ate it last night.	En wy ite it fannacht.
But it's a nice thing.	Mar it is in moai ding.
We were surprised he died.	Wy wiene ferrast dat hy stoar.
It had not been very difficult.	It hie net hiel dreech west.
Which is good for me.	Wat goed is foar my.
There is no place for him here.	Hjir is gjin plak foar him.
She had nothing.	Se hie neat.
It's either on or off.	It is of út of oan.
It had come out of nowhere.	It wie út it neat kommen.
But so sure he was not.	Mar sa wis wie er net.
She knew her father was not coming.	Se wist dat har heit net kaam.
But he's in a good place.	Mar hy is op in goed plak.
I see that today with so much.	Dat sjoch ik hjoed mei safolle.
Do not go to work.	Net oan it wurk gean.
They will bring them back to life.	Se sille har wer libben meitsje.
I was not the kind of person to go through in life.	Ik wie net it soarte fan persoan om troch te gean yn it libben.
We can see how that goes.	Wy kinne sjen hoe't dat giet.
I told you the truth.	Ik fertelde dy wierheid.
But not soon enough.	Mar net gau genôch.
If you do, you will know.	As jo ​​dat dogge sille jo witte.
For me, it's about the person.	It giet foar my om de persoan.
I work for one.	Ik wurkje by ien.
I like a child.	Ik like in bern.
His photo is in the book.	Syn foto stiet yn it boek.
They just did not have time for us.	Se hiene gewoan gjin tiid foar ús.
See it and think about your life.	Sjoch it en tink oer dyn libben.
I wanted to make him regret it.	Ik woe him spyt meitsje.
Maybe he was a man.	Miskien wie er in man.
That works too.	Dat wurket ek.
They never do.	Dat dogge se noait.
The water must stop.	It wetter moat ophâlde.
We all know that absolutely nothing will happen.	Wy witte allegear dat der hielendal neat sil barre.
It could still happen.	It koe noch wol.
And through him.	En troch him hinne.
He knows what.	Hy wit wat.
You will be here with us.	Jo sille hjir by ús wêze.
I'm not that good at that.	Dêr bin ik net sa goed yn.
One more left.	Noch ien fuort.
It's wrong.	It is ferkeard.
I wanted that to work so well.	Ik woe dat sa goed wurkje.
I really tried.	Ik haw echt besocht.
Tell me something else.	Fertel my wat oars.
Do not let them wait.	Lit se net wachtsje.
I will not be there.	Ik sil der net wêze.
If it's fun, give it a try.	As it liket leuk, besykje it.
They are exactly where you are.	Se binne krekt wêr't jo binne.
And maybe they will.	En miskien sille se.
Your photo will get me.	Jo foto sil my krije.
She must have been.	Se moat west hawwe.
Someone was waiting for her.	Immen wachte op har.
We never want to leave.	Wy wolle nea fuort.
And she still did.	En dat die se noch.
But it does not have to be at my house.	Mar it hoecht net by my thús te wêzen.
Think of the children!	Tink oan de bern!
I will try the other.	Ik sil de oare besykje.
How he does it will be entirely up to him.	Hoe't er it docht sil hielendal oan him wêze.
That's a problem.	Dat is in probleem.
That is for true.	Dat is foar wier.
It would look like that.	It soe lykje sa.
Well, give us the money.	No, jou ús it jild.
There was so much to do!	Der wie safolle te dwaan!
You opened the door, and there were two people.	Jo diene de doar iepen, en dêr wiene twa minsken.
We would stay here again.	Wy soene bliuwe hjir wer.
A door would open.	In doar soe iepen.
The day was the same kind of day.	De dei wie itselde soarte fan dei.
And the.	En de.
You've heard of it.	Jo hawwe der fan heard.
She thought it was okay.	Se tocht dat it goed wie.
It had happened.	It wie bard.
Someone who knows what's going on and can tell me.	Ien dy't witte wat der bart en my fertelle kinne.
Please, help us please.	Asjebleaft, help ús asjebleaft.
Over, and over, and over.	Oer, en oer, en oer.
Do not hurt the children.	Doch de bern net sear.
We think about problems when we get to bed.	Wy tinke oer problemen as wy op bêd komme.
You are the best.	Do bist de bêste.
She would not let him come to her.	Se soe him net by har komme litte.
She woke up before the alarm went off.	Se waard wekker foardat de wekker gie.
I will not say it.	Ik sil it net sizze.
But it's enough.	Mar it is genôch.
You must be a problem.	Jo moatte in probleem wêze.
I did not realize it.	Ik realisearre it net.
He often gets angry.	Hy wurdt faak lilk.
Everyone liked him.	Elkenien mocht him graach.
Of course, it's wrong.	Fansels is it ferkeard.
I got the same problem.	Ik krige itselde probleem.
The food is ready.	It iten is klear.
There's something you need to know.	D'r is wat dat jo witte moatte.
And children.	En bern.
That person was me.	Dy persoan wie ik.
I wonder if he's ever been here.	Ik freegje my ôf oft er hjir oait west hat.
There was nothing more to do here.	Der wie hjir neat mear te dwaan.
I thought it was such a thing.	Ik tocht dat it sa'n ding wie.
Maybe he already had a wife and a house.	Miskien hie er al in frou en in hûs.
She tried, but somehow could not look away.	Se besocht, mar koe op ien of oare manier net fuort sjen.
This is what it said.	Dit is wat it sei.
Whatever you need, you get it.	Wat jo ek nedich hawwe, jo krije it.
I think away from family, away from home.	Ik tink fuort fan famylje, fuort fan hûs.
So it's here.	Sa is it hjir.
Hope it will help.	Hoopje dat it sil helpe.
He is that of course, but he is much more than that.	Hy is dat fansels, mar hy is folle mear as dat.
Nobody really knows what to do.	Nimmen wit echt wat te dwaan.
Now you may think we are ready.	No kinne jo tinke dat wy klear binne.
She really had to go.	Se moast echt gean.
You are afraid for your life, but you are not the only one.	Jo binne bang foar jo libben, mar jo binne net de ienige.
Believe me, you will need it.	Leau my, jo sille it nedich hawwe.
And maybe the se.	En miskien die se.
He was out all day.	Hy wie de hiele dei út.
I would do it.	Ik soe it dwaan.
Nothing of the sort happened.	Neat fan it soarte barde.
How many are not.	Hoefolle binne net.
But not this.	Mar dit net.
He saw her and she did not see him.	Hy seach har en se seach him net.
There was no other chance.	Der wie gjin oare kâns.
They have already thought about that.	Dêr ha se al oan tocht.
Rather, it was a way of eating.	Earder wie it in manier fan iten.
That we can not say that it is nothing.	Dat wy kinne net sizze dat it neat is.
The parents are happy, but the children are not.	De âlden binne bliid, mar de bern net.
He told him the truth.	Hy fertelde him de wierheid.
I do not hold it against him.	Ik hâld it him net tsjin.
They had nothing to see.	Se hiene neat te sjen.
You and your children.	Jo en jo bern.
They got it good enough.	Se krigen it goed genôch.
Which was.	Hokker wie.
You should have seen me.	Do hiest my wol sjen moatten.
I've known him for a long time.	Ik ken him al lang.
That became clear from the letter.	Dat waard dúdlik út it brief.
How hard you want to make it to find it.	Hoe dreech jo wolle meitsje it te finen.
But they work pretty well.	Mar se wurkje aardich goed.
I know it was probably not the right thing to do.	Ik wit dat it wierskynlik net it goede ding wie om te dwaan.
And there he was again.	En dêr wie er wer.
I've seen him before.	Ik haw him earder sjoen.
She is something more.	Se is wat mear.
I did not see much.	Ik seach net folle.
It should not be so difficult.	It soe net sa dreech wêze moatte.
I knew something was wrong.	Ik wist dat der wat net goed wie.
She was not alone, she said.	Se wie net allinnich, sei se.
I was too scared to do anything.	Ik wie te bang om wat te dwaan.
She never met him.	Se hat him nea moete.
We tell about what we have seen.	Wy fertelle oer wat wy sjoen hawwe.
He did such a good job.	Hy die sa'n goed wurk.
I love being home.	Ik hâld fan thús te wêzen.
If you are going to tell the teacher, go do it.	As jo ​​fan plan binne de learaar te fertellen, gean dan doch it.
My mother joined her.	Myn mem kaam har by har.
She lets you have them well enough.	Se lit jo se goed genôch hawwe.
Probably not so good.	Wierskynlik net sa goed.
There were a few questions.	Der wiene in pear fragen.
They stay together.	Se bliuwe tegearre.
To be simple.	Om gewoan te wêzen.
Who's talking?	Wa docht it praten?
It's late and why worry.	It is let en wêrom soargen.
She knew everything now.	Se wist no alles.
No one entered or left the house.	Gjinien kaam it hûs yn of út.
It was your mother.	It wie dyn mem.
If she hadn't had the baby, she still would.	As se it bern mar net hân hie, hie se it noch.
And that's exactly what they did.	En dat is krekt wat se diene.
I'm working on the same thing now.	Ik wurkje no oan itselde ding.
She was beautiful now.	Se wie no moai.
Whoever it was, it didn’t matter.	Wa't it ek wiene, it makke neat út.
They could not stop.	Se koene net ophâlde.
I do not now.	Ik doch no net.
I could not get enough of it, from her.	Ik koe der net genôch fan krije, fan har.
But you just do not know it until you know it.	Mar jo witte it gewoan net, oant jo it witte.
And of course they are.	En fansels binne se.
But, again, maybe not.	Mar, wer, miskien net.
I had seen her.	Ik hie har sjoen.
But there was nothing else to say.	Mar der hoegde neat oars te sizzen.
I'll probably be here another hour.	Ik sil hjir nei alle gedachten noch in oere wêze.
It's so.	It is sa.
But it goes on.	Mar it giet troch.
Of course it will.	Fansels sil it.
If not, who knows.	Sa net, wa wit.
How was your day today?	Hoe wie dyn dei hjoed?
They had started again.	Se wiene wer begûn.
For some reason, it was different with this book.	Om ien of oare reden wie it oars mei dit boek.
It's hard to resist, believe me.	It is dreech om tsjin te gean, leau my.
But he had not told anyone why.	Mar hy hie gjinien ferteld wêrom.
Everyone comes in.	Elkenien komt yn.
So it must be.	Sa moat it.
Her plan had not worked.	Har plan hie net wurke.
It was not once so.	It wie net eartiids sa.
She would not ask.	Se soe net freegje.
Where have you been? 	Wêr hawwe jo west?
Never seen the man before.	Nea sjoen de man earder.
He made it for himself.	Hy hat it foar himsels makke.
I do not regret it.	It spyt my der net fan.
For now, that was enough.	Foar no wie dat genôch.
None of it.	Gjin fan it.
I want to do what's good.	Ik wol dwaan wat goed is.
But this book seems good to me.	Mar dit boek liket my goed.
That's not how it happened.	Dat is net hoe't it barde.
And so it is with money.	En sa is it mei jild.
I met him too.	Ik moete him ek.
And so, we think, it was.	En sa, tinke wy, wie it.
Here's something from me.	Hjir is wat fan my.
She was his life for life.	Se wie syn libben foar it libben.
Who and more.	Wa en mear.
This is not a job for children, she told no one.	Dit is gjin baan foar bern, sei se tsjin gjinien.
However, it was nothing.	Hoe dan ek, it wie neat.
He looks like you.	Hy liket op dy.
People will not take it anymore.	Minsken sille it net mear nimme.
I think it was just me.	Ik tink dat it krekt my wie.
But we do not.	Mar wy net.
But those are not.	Mar dy binne net.
They can hurt.	Se kinne sear dwaan.
If it was me, school would come first.	As it my wie, soe skoalle earst komme.
And maybe the only two on that.	En miskien de ienige twa op dat.
And that was three days ago.	En dat wie trije dagen lyn.
This is what his father tried to tell him.	Dit is wat syn heit him besocht te fertellen.
There is something for everyone here.	Der is hjir wat foar elkenien.
Now he.	No hy.
Or to buy from us.	Of om ús te keapjen.
It can work.	It kin wurkje.
We go home from work.	Wy geane fan it wurk nei hûs.
I can not wait to get into them !.	Ik kin net wachtsje om yn har te kommen!.
The question is when.	De fraach is wannear.
Whatever it was, it was not food.	Wat it ek wie, it wie gjin iten.
At home.	Thús.
You will find the way.	Jo sille de wei fine.
I'll tell you what we do here.	Ik sil jo fertelle wat wy hjir dogge.
But they did nothing about it.	Mar se diene der neat mei.
In and out before they know what's going on.	Yn en út foardat se witte wat der bart.
It's done now.	It is no dien.
I feel hurt.	Ik fiel my sear.
It was not who she wanted to be.	It wie net wa't se wêze woe.
I know what he would do.	Ik wit wat er dwaan soe.
You have to stay.	Jo moatte bliuwe.
Things happen, life happens.	Dingen bart, it libben bart.
We are family.	Wy binne famylje.
We have been free this week.	Wy hawwe dizze wike frij west.
We believe the same can be said here.	Wy leauwe dat itselde hjir sein wurde kin.
Not enough.	Net genôch wêze.
She saw nothing.	Se seach neat.
Maybe this will help.	Miskien sil dit helpe.
And that will be it.	En dat sil it wêze.
I was in my bed.	Ik wie yn myn bêd.
I liked that.	Dat mocht ik graach.
Let me not do that.	Lit my it net dwaan.
I'm never sure how to take him.	Ik bin noait wis hoe't ik him nimme moat.
Then again, maybe this should be difficult.	Dan wer, miskien soe it dreech wêze moatte.
As it were.	As it gewoan wie.
When both were in the house, there was not much talk.	Doe't beide yn 'e hûs wiene, waard der net folle praat.
They are made for each other.	Se binne makke foar elkoar.
She did see him as a man.	Se seach him wol as in man.
She did not agree.	Se wie it net iens.
This is our mother.	Dit is ús mem.
This is a great opportunity.	Dit is in grutte kâns.
She did not say much.	Se sei net folle.
Do something else.	Doch wat oars.
Your hair looks really nice today.	Dyn hier sjocht der hjoed echt moai út.
That's just what happened here.	Dat is hjir krekt bard.
Can someone please help me with this.	Kin immen my asjebleaft helpe mei dizze.
But there was only one man she ever wanted.	Mar der wie mar ien man dy't se ea woe.
But we did not.	Mar dat diene wy ​​net.
For now, that will.	Foar no, dat wol.
I want to show it.	Ik wol it sjen litte.
I have nothing for you.	Ik ha neat foar dy.
She's here in two weeks.	Se is hjir oer twa wike.
We would do it every day.	Wy soene it alle dagen dwaan.
She was in trouble.	Se wie yn de problemen.
It's a good place.	It is in goed plak.
But we would be wrong.	Mar wy soene ferkeard wêze.
Her husband did.	Har man die dat wol.
You can find out more about this here.	Jo kinne hjir mear oer fine.
She sits in there every day.	Se sit der alle dagen yn.
Both did not happen.	Beide binne net bard.
That you really need to be about it.	Dat jo moatte der echt oer wêze.
You will hurt her.	Jo sille har sear dwaan.
She is so happy.	Se is sa bliid.
The good man is coming back.	De goede man komt werom.
This weekend is getting tough.	Dit wykein wurdt hurd.
People love them!	Minsken hâlde fan har!
But he would have nothing to do with it.	Mar hy soe der neat fan hawwe.
I can see we need to look after you.	Ik kin sjen dat wy nei dy moatte sjen.
It is that they were already there.	It is dat se der al wiene.
He did so three times.	Dat die er trije kear.
I love you, boy.	Ik hâld fan dy, jonge.
She felt like she was a child again.	Se fielde dat se wer in bern wie.
It's about what you do about the problem.	It giet om wat jo dogge oer it probleem.
That's right, that's all the work you have to do.	Dat is krekt, dat is al it wurk dat jo dwaan moatte.
I just did not want to talk to her anymore.	Ik woe gewoan net mear mei har prate.
He was his friend, it seemed.	Hy wie syn freon, like it.
You do not get them too often.	Jo krije se net te faak.
I no longer feel good.	Ik fiel my net mear goed.
She would not ask.	Se soe net freegje.
The whole city came out.	De hiele stêd kaam út.
That was not enough for me, ever.	Dat wie my net genôch, noait.
We just do not work that way.	Wy wurkje gewoan net sa.
He will be here for a long time.	Hy sil hjir noch lang wêze.
You were fine.	Do hiest it goed.
It's back again.	It is wer werom.
How beautiful he was.	Wat wie er moai.
It works now.	It wurket no.
Had to think about it sooner.	Moast der earder oan tinke.
She could not have met him.	Se koe him net moete hawwe.
It has no giving at all.	It hat hielendal gjin jaan.
I know, this is not nice to say.	Ik wit, dit is net moai om te sizzen.
The room seemed to be quite old.	De keamer like frij âld te wêzen.
How to 'come'.	Hoe't jo 'komme'.
That's what we'll see.	Dat sille wy sjen.
We'll talk to parents.	Wy sille mei âlden prate.
It went on for a day or two.	It gie dêr in dei as twa oer.
Maybe he can see nothing.	Miskien kin er neat sjen.
I knew that.	Dat wist ik wol.
I just do not know.	Ik wit it gewoan net.
I have no one else to help me.	Ik haw gjinien oars om my te helpen.
I'm your wife.	Ik bin dyn frou.
And the woman, that was not her.	En de frou, dat wie se net.
He thought we could be friends.	Hy tocht dat wy freonen wêze kinne.
She had not seen him for a long time.	Se hie him al lang net sjoen.
He works for me.	Hy wurket foar my.
He left her, she knew that.	Hy liet har, dat wist se.
And if it works, it works.	En as it wurket, wurket it.
I really wish there was a way to do this.	Ik winskje echt dat d'r in manier wie om dit te dwaan.
Go now, your mother may need your help.	Gean no, dyn mem kin dyn help nedich hawwe.
I never thought of that.	Ik tocht der noait wat fan.
You should not have left either.	Do hiest ek net fuort moatten.
Just be happy !.	Wês gewoan bliid!.
Enough for him to see.	Genôch foar him om te sjen.
They are all here!	Se binne hjir allegear!
She felt her wake up.	Se fielde har wekker wurde.
I do not know how that will happen.	Ik wit net hoe't dat barre sil.
I do not know.	Ik wit net.
Is there anyone?	Is der immen?
It must be more than that.	It moat mear wêze as dat.
You boy.	Do jonge.
But even if it was true.	Mar ek al wie it wier.
You can have one without the other.	Jo kinne ien hawwe sûnder de oare.
He has a plan.	Hy hat in plan.
It was too late to go home.	It wie te let om nei hûs te gean.
And he could not believe it, but he came.	En hy koe it net leauwe, mar hy kaam.
Just make it happen.	Meitsje it gewoan oan.
She would go when her time came.	Se soe gean as har tiid kaam.
That's what you should ask her.	Dat soene jo har freegje moatte.
Almost time of the month.	Hast tiid fan 'e moanne.
You are not home enough with the children.	Bist net genôch thús mei de bern.
They just talk it out, and everyone is happy.	Se prate it gewoan út, en elkenien is bliid.
My husband got it too.	Myn man krige it ek.
But we buy into it.	Mar wy keapje der yn.
I went back to school today.	Ik gie hjoed werom nei skoalle.
At first he looked at me as if he could not see me.	Earst seach er my oan as koe er my net.
I do not need your help.	Ik haw jo help net nedich.
I know the city well.	Ik ken de stêd goed.
Well, not here, boy.	No, hjir net, jonge.
They have each other.	Se hawwe elkoar.
I assume it never came.	Ik nim oan dat it noait kaam.
It was that time of year.	It wie dy tiid fan it jier.
That it does not go away.	Dat it net fuort giet.
I was scared of him.	Ik wie bang foar him.
You have to get out of there, man.	Jo moatte der út, man.
But this is about more than that.	Mar dit giet oer mear as dat.
And that may well be good.	En dat kin wol goed wêze.
It must stop.	It moat ophâlde.
She's back there.	Se is der wer by.
And stayed.	En bleau.
We need to do better.	Wy moatte it better dwaan.
I do not really think so.	Ik tink it net echt sa.
He got nothing.	Hy krige neat.
Free to be alone.	Frij om allinnich te wêzen.
You did.	Dat diene jo.
It's up to you.	It is oan dy.
You're too good of a guy to not do it.	Do bist te goed fan in keardel om it net te dwaan.
I've done it before.	Ik haw it earder dien.
Let's talk about what worked.	Litte wy prate oer wat wurke.
Ask someone to do something.	Freegje immen wat te dwaan.
He may not even know it yet, but he needs his mother.	Hy wit it miskien noch net iens, mar hy hat syn mem nedich.
They go away together.	Se geane tegearre fuort.
It worked very nicely.	It wurke hiel moai.
I had to eat.	Ik moast ite.
Maybe you did.	Miskien hawwe jo dien.
Do it better than you can.	Doch it better as jo kinne.
That's too bad now, too late.	Dat is no te min, te let.
No one can leave until he is finished with food.	Nimmen kin fuort oant er klear is mei iten.
He also has something to her.	Hy hat ek wat oan har.
We'll have you back in bed in no time.	Wy hawwe dy yn gjin tiid wer thús op bêd.
Boy, would it be nice if there was.	Jonge, it soe wol moai wêze as der wie.
Better nothing to say.	Better neat te sizzen.
We should all be happy.	Wy moatte allegear bliid wêze.
It showed him everything.	It liet him alles sjen.
And just like that, he never came back.	En krekt sa kaam er nea werom.
Even if you are not in the now, you are in the now.	Sels as jo net yn it no binne, binne jo yn it no.
In.	Yn.
That's a very good idea.	Dat is in hiel goed idee.
He knew she did not need that.	Hy wist dat se dat net hoegde.
He did nothing.	Hy die neat.
He should be.	Hy soe wêze moatte.
The question is how to do that.	De fraach is hoe dat te dwaan.
I would not let her.	Ik soe har net litte litte.
Getting work.	Wurk te krijen.
I know exactly what he said.	Ik wit krekt wat hy fertelde.
Know what you are buying and you will be happy.	Witte wat jo keapje en jo sille bliid wêze.
The truth never matters a bit.	De wierheid makket noait in bytsje út.
He could do it.	Hy koe it dwaan.
We think that is not necessary.	Wy tinke dat dat net nedich is.
Time is money.	Tiid is jild.
And this one really looks good enough.	En dizze sjocht der echt genôch út.
Just being a woman is no longer enough.	Gewoan in frou wêze is net mear genôch.
This is what we know now, everyone.	Dit is wat wy no witte, elkenien.
It is what it is.	It is, wat it is.
There are a few of these.	D'r binne in pear fan dizze.
That was for other days.	Dat wie foar oare dagen.
A man's man this guy.	In man syn man dizze keardel.
He was surprised to see him.	Hy wie ferrast om him te sjen.
You take him.	Jo nimme him.
The hours are long.	De oeren binne lang.
The old man wondered what kind of thing this would do.	De âld man frege him ôf wat foar ding dit meitsje soe.
He's happy, even though he's not.	Hy is bliid, ek al seit er dat er net is.
Bring a friend if you have one '.	Nim in freon mei as jo ien hawwe'.
That's up to you.	Dat is oan dy.
But the great thing is this.	Mar it grutte ding is dit.
I was up.	Ik wie op.
I would never have thought this would happen.	Ik soe nea tinke dat dit soe barre.
I'm the young girl, the young girl is me.	Ik bin it jonge famke, it jonge famke is my.
I love her more than life.	Ik hâld mear fan har as it libben.
Same as before.	Itselde as earder.
But there was not much of it.	Mar dêr wie net folle fan.
They can do things.	Se kinne dingen dwaan.
I'm not even asking you to help him.	Ik freegje jo net iens om him te helpen.
Or whatever.	Of wat dan ek jaan.
He likes to do things with and for our children as well.	Hy makket graach dingen mei en foar ús bern ek.
Everything we needed or asked for was never a problem.	Alles wat wy nedich of frege om wie nea in probleem.
Just think about it.	Tink der mar oer nei.
That's just all.	Dit is net alles.
It was a day before that.	It wie der in dei foar.
I could not see where they were, when they were gone, or what.	Ik koe net sjen wêr't se wiene, as se fuort wiene, of wat.
You can try and see if that works.	Jo kinne besykje en sjen oft dat wurket.
I want to know what happens then.	Ik wol witte wat der dan bart.
And that, of course, still ran.	En dat rûn fansels noch.
Nothing has ever come easily to me in this life.	Neat is my oait maklik yn dit libben kommen.
It should be tonight.	It soe fannacht wêze moatte.
I knew her.	Ik koe har.
But this time it will be difficult.	Mar dizze kear sil dat dreech wurde.
Get it right.	It goed krije.
This book has all three.	Dit boek hat alle trije.
I was not too busy.	Ik wie der net al te drok fan.
I love being a mom.	Ik hâld fan mem te wêzen.
Do you want a hand in that?	Wolle jo dêr in hân mei?
I would like to know if there is a way around this.	Ik wol graach witte oft der in manier om dit hinne is.
It could have gone to him.	It koe him wol gean.
That was really about it.	Dat wie der echt oer.
The right word.	It goede wurd.
Someone out there is worried.	Immen út dêr is soargen.
I just did not think so much.	Ik tocht gewoan net sa folle.
He will not be.	Hy sil net wêze.
Then your friends or family can easily find you.	Dan kinne jo freonen of famylje jo maklik fine.
Mom would be different.	Mem soe oars wêze.
Don't leave me.	Gean net by my wei.
You can not deal with this.	Jo kinne net mei dit.
Where did he go?	Wêr is hy hinne gien.
I was her on the first day.	Ik wie har op 'e earste dei.
No one was talking.	Gjinien wie oan it praten.
It's what you do.	It is wat jo dogge.
I totally agree with what you say	Ik bin it hielendal iens mei wat jo sizze
His only pair.	Syn ienige pear.
Try to help make them look better.	Besykje te helpen om se better te sjen.
So can you.	Sa kinne jo.
He would give it a chance.	Hy soe it kâns jaan.
He was mine.	Hy wie myn.
He could not let him think so.	Hy koe him sa net tinke litte.
He did need the help of the bard.	Hy hie wol de help fan de bard nedich.
Why do you think this happened?	Wêrom tinke jo dat dit barde?
She's wrong.	Se is ferkeard.
They can not.	Se kinne net.
He had kept his word.	Hy hie syn wurd hâlden.
It had scared me.	It hie my bang makke.
He had seen that happen too and had done nothing.	Hy hie dat ek barre sjoen en hie neat dien.
First.	Earste.
I just need to know what it is.	Ik moat gewoan witte wat it is.
It's pretty easy to see why.	It is frij maklik om te sjen wêrom.
And it was still too late.	En it wie noch te let.
They do not work well alone.	Se wurkje net goed allinnich.
Tell me exactly how he would do it.	Fertel my krekt hoe't hy it dwaan soe.
None of this was.	Gjin fan dit wie.
I will not tell you how it was done.	Ik sil jo net fertelle hoe't it dien is.
More likely, the truth is just too late.	Mear wierskynlik is de wierheid gewoan te let.
She was a beautiful girl.	Se wie in moai famke.
And it makes me look bad.	En it makket my sjoch min.
We do not know how.	Wy witte net hoe.
There was only it now.	Der wie allinnich it no.
I had no plan.	Ik hie gjin plan.
Sit back.	Sit werom.
It must be different.	It moat oars.
If you have any questions, please let me know.	As jo ​​​​fragen hawwe, lit it my dan witte.
Another time, he said.	In oare kear, sei er.
You take a little bit of everything.	Jo nimme in bytsje wat fan alles.
And she could be.	En se koe wêze.
We still do.	Dat dogge wy noch.
They set it all up.	Se sette it allegear op.
He's in the car.	Hy yn 'e auto.
My parents got it too.	Myn âlden krigen it ek.
Many people were very happy.	In protte minsken wiene tige bliid.
But it's clear you do not like them.	Mar it is dúdlik dat jo har net leuk fine.
The work is too bad.	It wurk is te min.
But they should not be.	Mar se moatte net wêze.
We haven't heard from him in three weeks.	Wy hawwe al trije wike neat fan him heard.
You have nothing to worry about.	Jo hawwe neat te soargen oer.
I would be happy for anything.	Ik soe bliid wêze foar alles.
It showed her.	It liet har sjen.
He heard nothing.	Hy hearde neat.
But a bit of both.	Mar in bytsje fan beide.
More than we ever had.	Mear as wy ea hiene.
It's always fun for me to have time with you.	It is altyd leuk foar my om tiid mei dy te hawwen.
Do what you can to help.	Doch wat jo kinne om te helpen.
And working with another woman, it comes down to more.	En mei in oare frou wurkje, komt it mear op.
It's a good problem to have.	It is in goed probleem om te hawwen.
I have never seen such a thing.	Ik haw noch noait sa'n ding sjoen.
I work as a teacher.	Ik wurkje as learaar.
No one was for him.	Gjinien wie him foar.
Not quite yet.	Noch net hielendal.
Of course, everyone wanted to come first.	Fansels woe elkenien earst komme.
Are you here new week?	Binne jo hjir nije wike?
It's the way with life.	It is de wei mei it libben.
That should stop.	Dat moat ophâlde.
This was the bed.	Dit wie it bêd.
I want it all.	Ik wol it allegear.
I'm sure you would do the same.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo itselde dwaan soene.
I knew he had problems.	Ik wist dat hy problemen hie.
I think she needs to be told what's going on.	Ik tink dat se ferteld wurde moat wat der bart.
I really had no idea what it could be.	Ik hie echt gjin idee wat it koe wêze.
We will win easily.	Wy sille winne maklik.
You can not think about it.	Jo kinne der net oer tinke.
I want you now.	Ik wol dy no.
Bye bye!	Oant sjen!
But he did not do it so often.	Mar hy die it net sa faak.
Please let me know what to do.	Lit my asjebleaft witte wat te dwaan.
I can see why she loves her.	Ik kin sjen wêrom't se fan har hâldt.
Told him well.	Sei him mar goed.
He would see her this weekend.	Hy soe har dit wykein sjen.
They had no time.	Se hiene gjin tiid hân.
I was sure of it.	Ik wie der wis fan.
It's a week ago.	It is in wike lyn.
They had not talked about it.	Se hiene der net oer praat.
We could talk about everything together.	Wy koene tegearre oer alles prate.
I do not know when and how or why.	Ik wit net wannear en hoe of wêrom.
But that is not the problem now.	Mar dat is no net it probleem.
No one else will know what you are saying.	Nimmen oars sil witte wat jo sizze.
We're still talking to each other.	Wy prate noch mei elkoar.
Both are bad.	Beide is min.
I'm fine with that.	Ik bin der goed mei.
I did, but not exactly.	Ik die, mar net krekt.
Must see that.	Moatte dat sjen.
It was so free.	It wie sa frij.
It already does the same thing.	It docht al itselde.
What is different.	Wat oars is.
I was wondering what would happen in two months.	Ik tocht wat der oer twa moanne barre soe.
They will have to go.	Se sille moatte gean.
So it was.	Sa wie it wol.
Not afraid of him.	Net bang foar him.
She did nothing of the sort.	Se die neat fan it soarte.
It would not do.	Dit soe net dwaan.
This time he opened it.	Dizze kear die er it iepen.
I know that's not good.	Ik wit dat dat net goed is.
I'm not sure what the first one is.	Ik bin der net wis fan wat de earste is.
This seems like it would make a big bowl.	Dit liket as soe it in grutte kom meitsje.
Who does not love him.	Wa hâldt him net.
We want to know what happened.	Wy wolle witte wat der bard is.
No one will ever know that.	Nimmen sil dat ea witte.
Anyway.	Hoe dan ek.
She would not tell it either.	Se soe it ek net fertelle.
Can anyone help me with this.	Kin immen my helpe mei dizze.
They need to know where he's coming from.	Se moatte witte wêr't er wei komt.
He ran and ran.	Hy rûn en rûn.
Do not be afraid, people!	Wês net bang, minsken!
Let me put it another way.	Lit my it oars sizze.
She was easy to like.	Se wie maklik om fan te hâlden.
Not true at all.	Hielendal net wier.
We've done this before.	Dat hawwe wy earder dien.
The kids were good at school.	De bern wiene goed op skoalle.
It was just like a movie.	It wie krekt as in film.
We are happy about it.	Wy binne der bliid om.
I myself do not want anything to do with it.	Ik sels wol der neat mei ha.
He's still standing there.	Hy stiet der noch.
But let's be clear.	Mar litte wy dúdlik wêze.
My parents were gone.	Myn âlden wiene fuort.
We'll see you again next time.	Wy sille jo de folgjende kear wer sjen.
She can not be.	Se kin net wêze.
So, we were up there.	Sa, wy wiene der op.
Well, this is something true.	No, dit is wat wier.
It does not really matter to her.	It makket har net echt út.
She was always busy.	Se wie altyd drok.
That's what they tell me.	Dat sizze se my.
This as very often a problem.	Dit as heul faak in probleem.
And you should be too.	En jo moatte ek wêze.
So shall we.	Sa sille wy.
He knows the man better than anyone.	Hy ken de man better as immen.
And this is not the way.	En dit is net de manier.
It was never true.	It wie noait wier.
The police are not coming here.	De plysje komt hjir net.
A lot of things happen here.	In protte dingen bart hjir.
All old, now.	Allegear âld, no.
She will have that too, but not for long.	Dat sil se ek ha, mar net lang.
He thought of nothing else.	Hy tocht oan neat oars.
These days would remain without name or place or time.	Dizze dagen soene sûnder namme of plak of tiid bliuwe.
He ate some food.	Hy iet wat iten.
They win.	Se winne.
He took your place.	Hy naam dyn plak yn.
And he took me.	En hy naam my.
They are all sick.	Se binne allegear siik.
Take one.	Nim ien.
Do not worry about time.	Meitsje jo gjin soargen oer tiid.
That seemed to tell.	Dat like te fertellen.
Of course not.	Dat die se fansels net.
He may have.	Hy kin hawwe.
He still has some work to do.	Hy hat noch wat wurk te dwaan.
It's not my problem.	It is net myn probleem.
I have a question.	Ik haw in fraach.
I'm getting tired.	Ik wurd wurch.
I'm waiting for him to come back.	Ik wachtsje op him om werom te kommen.
It is not clear that we can do this.	It is net dúdlik dat wy dit kinne dwaan.
We could ask him.	Wy koene him freegje.
Many other things too.	In protte oare dingen ek.
I thought it could be from you.	Ik tocht dat it fan dy wêze koe.
People do not think clearly.	Minsken tinke net dúdlik.
This man has neither.	Dizze man hat gjin beide.
I will be there and.	Ik sil der wêze en.
It goes on and on.	It giet troch en troch.
They really work too.	Se wurkje echt ek.
I have never been a husband or father.	Ik haw noait in man of heit west.
Go now, please.	Gean no, asjebleaft.
But also the woman.	Mar ek de frou.
Do you need anything more?	Binne jo wat mear nedich?
I have to get to work.	Ik moat oan it wurk.
She did not say why.	Se sei net wêrom.
I think what they are doing to you is wrong.	Ik tink dat wat se jo dogge is ferkeard.
Another day, a few hours.	In oare dei, in pear oeren.
In this photo.	Op dizze foto.
If she wants to.	As se wol.
Always loved them.	Hie altyd fan har hâlden.
Or maybe she had something else in mind.	Of miskien hie se wat oars yn gedachten.
Let him do what he has to do.	Lit him dwaan wat er dwaan moat.
Really, really bad.	Echt, echt min.
You need a better book.	Jo moatte in better boek.
Then we can play.	Dan kinne wy ​​spylje.
I'm sure you'd like to keep it that way.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo it graach hâlde wolle.
I did not agree with him.	Ik wie it net mei him iens.
They would have found this place.	Se soene dit plak fûn hawwe.
They knew he was coming now.	Se wisten dat er no kaam.
She had to see for herself.	Se moast sels sjen.
I had nothing to do with it.	Ik hie der neat oan.
It had been two years.	It hie al twa jier west.
It was time to eat out.	It wie tiid om út te iten.
He gave her something back.	Hy joech har wat werom.
But it was too soon for that.	Mar dêr wie it te gau foar.
There was not much more for him to do.	Der wie net folle mear foar him te dwaan.
Talk to him through it.	Praat him troch it.
She's a great woman.	Se is in grutte frou.
Or some kind of car.	Of in soarte fan auto.
Well, almost everyone.	No, hast elkenien.
Over and over and over again.	Oer en oer en wer.
I knew exactly what she wanted.	Ik wist krekt wat se woe.
He was just a child.	Hy wie mar in bern.
But that is not what happened.	Mar dat is net wat bard.
She has nothing.	Se hat neat.
You tell him something to do and he does it.	Jo fertelle him wat te dwaan en hy docht it.
There are actually.	Der binne eins.
She would not say what they had done, or why.	Se soe net sizze wat se dien hiene, of wêrom.
I would never want to see him in my life.	Ik soe him nea yn myn libben sjen wolle.
She looked at him now.	Se seach him no oan.
But my dad made you up.	Mar myn heit makke dy op.
But so often we make big.	Mar sa faak meitsje wy grutte.
She was not wrong about him.	Se wie net ferkeard oer him.
I talk to her all the time.	Ik praat mei har de hiele tiid.
For me, that has it all.	Foar my hat dat alles.
Well, there's for you.	No, der is foar dy.
It's totally good.	It is hielendal goed.
I hope you do the same !.	Ik hoopje dat jo itselde dogge!.
There will be a few.	Der sil in pear wêze.
It could not have been much better for him.	It koe net folle better foar him.
It's all or nothing.	It is alles of neat.
That was what he liked to do.	Dat wie er graach dwaan.
She was waiting for me.	Se wachte op my.
I know how this works.	Ik wit hoe't dit wurket.
That was clear enough.	Dat wie dúdlik genôch.
The young man was angry.	De jonge man wie lilk.
You do not need much, but you should have two or three.	Jo hawwe net folle nedich, mar jo moatte twa of trije hawwe.
You get a lot of help.	Jo krije in protte help.
He's a good man, she thought.	It is in goed man, tocht se.
I could just look into it.	Ik koe der krekt yn sjen.
They never assume that everyone knows what is expected of them.	Se geane der noait fan út dat elkenien wit wat fan har ferwachte wurdt.
He's like a child.	Hy is as in bern.
This year he should be.	Dit jier moat er wêze.
Well, maybe you will now.	No, miskien sille jo no.
She did not like living in a big city.	Se mocht net graach yn in grutte stêd wenje.
I was in the room.	Ik wie yn 'e keamer.
We really want to make this work.	Wy wolle echt dit wurk meitsje.
It's just gone.	It is gewoan fuort.
Or you can tell us what you know.	Of jo kinne ús fertelle wat jo witte.
He would not say how.	Hy soe net sizze hoe.
I'm so glad people like it.	Ik bin sa bliid dat minsken it leuk fine.
It had nothing to do with me or my office.	It hie neat mei my of myn kantoar te krijen.
I do not do that.	Dat doch ik net.
I will wait until then.	Ik sil wachtsje oant dan.
It felt like he was reading my mind.	It fielde as wie er myn gedachten lêzen.
He does not know what is happening.	Hy wit net wat der bart.
We do not want this.	Wy winskje dit net.
We need to let you know what you want now.	Wy moatte jo hawwe litte wat jo no wolle.
This went much better.	Dizze gie folle better.
I was for that.	Dêr wie ik foar.
Everything was fine with me.	Alles wie goed mei my.
She was as beautiful as her mother.	Se wie sa moai as har mem.
He will take me back.	Hy sil my werom nimme.
You can get whatever you want there.	Jo kinne krije wat jo wolle dêr.
But there was still nothing that anyone could do.	Mar der wie noch neat dat ien dwaan koe.
She was like.	Se wie like.
But not so much.	Mar net sa folle.
So let's show.	Sa litte wy sjen litte.
I know, but the question is why.	Ik wit it, mar de fraach is wêrom.
She liked to be busy and needed.	Se mocht graach drok en nedich wêze.
I'm glad you decided to take this opportunity.	Ik bin bliid dat jo besletten hawwe dizze kâns te nimmen.
But do not tell me.	Mar fertel it my net.
She had spoken.	Se hie praat.
Be very careful!	Wês tige foarsichtich!
He looked around.	Hy seach om.
I just got off.	Ik ha gewoan ôf.
I can not leave you here.	Ik kin dy hjir net litte.
This is my favorite movie.	Dit is myn favorite film.
There's only one way to find out what's going on.	D'r is mar ien manier om út te finen wat der bart.
Not when he was back now.	Net doe't er no werom wie.
She must be who she is now.	Se moat wêze wa't se no is.
We do not have enough money.	Wy hawwe net genôch jild.
But she must have time.	Mar se moat tiid ha.
He did not want her to know.	Hy woe net dat se it wist.
It would not take much.	It soe net folle nimme.
They said it was not a problem.	Se seine dat it gjin probleem wie.
I'm out of place.	Ik bin út plak.
Not with everyone watching.	Net mei elkenien dy't sjocht.
I knew him forever.	Ik koe him foar altyd.
It's been so long ago.	It is sa lang lyn.
You can see what you like.	Jo kinne sjen wat jo leuk fine.
There is no book that can do it for you.	D'r is gjin boek dat it foar jo kin dwaan.
Here she was happy.	Hjir wie se bliid.
Well, well, that's not true.	No, goed, dat is net wier.
I have not seen it yet.	Ik haw it noch net sjoen.
You can find them here.	Jo kinne se hjir fine.
This hour has made us so.	Dit oere hat ús sa makke.
They stop talking.	Se hâlde op mei praten.
This can be so.	Dit kin sa wêze.
It had become very common.	It wie hiel gewoan wurden.
You must be free to go or stay.	Jo moatte frij wêze om te gean of te bliuwen.
We would have trouble finding you.	Wy soene problemen hawwe om jo te finen.
You do not have to tell anyone.	Jo moatte it nimmen fertelle.
I heard it was very good.	Ik hearde dat it hiel goed wie.
She looked at me.	Se seach my oan.
And open about it too.	En der ek iepen oer.
It just wouldn’t.	It soe gewoan net.
But you know how it is.	Mar jo witte hoe't it is.
I still have a lot of work to do.	Ik haw noch in protte wurk te dwaan.
I'm not quite sure how to do that.	Ik bin net krekt wis hoe't ik dat dwaan moat.
And even how they did it.	En sels hoe't se it diene.
It was not for me.	It wie net foar my.
It was just fine.	It wie krekt goed.
They need a few weeks off.	Se hawwe in pear wike frij nedich.
He did not look scared at all.	Hy seach der hielendal net bang út.
They don't talk anymore.	Se prate net mear.
He never says a word.	Hy seit nea in wurd.
This did not work.	Dit hat net wurke.
There is a lot of truth in that.	Der sit in protte wierheid op.
But no worries, you have this.	Mar gjin soargen, jo hawwe dit.
On the same weekend.	Op itselde wykein.
It's an alarm clock, an alarm clock.	It is in wekker, in wekker.
There was more than that.	Der wie mear as dat.
This can help if someone needs it.	Dit kin helpe as immen nedich is.
Or so she says herself.	Of dat seit se sels.
There was no money received or anything like that.	Der waard gjin jild krigen of sa'n ding.
But, there is more.	Mar, der is mear.
But she could not return now.	Mar se koe no net werom.
What is mine is yours.	Wat fan my is, is fan dy.
I just thought it could wait.	Ik tocht gewoan dat it wachtsje koe.
You want to come with me somehow.	Jo wolle op ien of oare manier mei my komme.
It's likely he did.	It is wierskynlik dat hy die.
But we'll see what happens.	Mar wy sille sjen wat der bart.
It has been really hard for her.	It hat har echt dreech west.
Or so everyone said.	Of sa sei elkenien.
Not bad so far.	Net min oant no ta.
Be careful with the words you speak.	Wês foarsichtich mei de wurden dy't jo prate.
And they did not.	En dat diene se net.
And there are a lot of things about that.	En dêr binne in protte dingen oer.
She must not be left alone.	Se moat net allinnich bliuwe.
She carefully opened the door.	Se die foarsichtich de doar iepen.
They did not.	Dat diene se net.
A few times it came from us.	In pear kear kaam it fan ús ôf.
He wanted it for another reason.	Hy woe it om in oare reden.
He just needed a chance.	Hy hie gewoan in kâns nedich.
I want children to have your name.	Ik wol dat bern dyn namme hat.
She could not do the happy thing.	Se koe it bliid ding net dwaan.
I felt him go.	Ik fielde him gean.
We need to get to work now.	Wy moatte no oan it wurk.
I never wanted to hurt you.	Ik woe dy noait sear dwaan.
Or maybe they have been friends for a long time.	Of miskien binne se al lang earder freonen west.
I do not want to go there.	Ik wol der net hinne.
You should not eat much.	Jo moatte net folle ite.
Are you ready for the party?	Binne jo klear foar it feest?
It all seems like so long ago.	It liket allegear sa lang lyn.
She now knew all too well how that felt.	Se wist no mar al te goed hoe't dat fielde.
We family, boy.	Wy famylje, jonge.
That's what you do best.	Dat dogge jo it bêste.
I had never heard such a thing.	Ik hie noch noait sa'n ding heard.
Do not think too much of it.	Tink der net te folle fan.
No reason, either.	Gjin reden, ek.
There may be one.	It kin wêze dat der in.
This is not the problem right now.	Dit is no net it probleem.
There is no better word.	Der is gjin better wurd.
We go back to where we are now.	Wy geane werom nei wêr't wy no binne.
We could not talk about it.	Wy koene der net oer prate kinne.
But they could not help it.	Mar se koene it net helpe.
You will find two in this book.	Jo sille twa fine yn dit boek.
And that's good.	En dit is goed.
Over time, people get tired.	Mei de tiid wurde minsken wurch.
You will again.	Jo sille wer.
We did not make them.	Wy hawwe se net makke.
In a few hours.	Yn in pear oeren.
We did not do it, man.	Wy hawwe it net dien, man.
None of that.	Gjin fan dat.
I made money.	Ik makke jild.
For me it is different.	By my is it oars.
They said he would be back tonight.	Se seine dat hy fannacht werom komt.
Just make it happen.	Krekt meitsje it barre.
Play on being a man again.	Spylje op wer man wêze.
We become different.	Wy wurde oars.
And also happy.	En ek bliid.
Maybe a little too much.	Miskien in bytsje te folle.
It did not work.	It wurke net.
He waited.	Hy wachte.
That’s what she did last month.	Dat hat se de lêste moanne dien.
Stay home to get the food.	Thús bliuwe om it iten te krijen.
What if.	Wat as.
Be necessary.	Wês nedich.
A little difficult, actually.	In bytsje dreech, eins.
We will not be visited tonight, she said.	Wy wurde fannacht net besocht, sei se.
We're angry.	Wy binne lilk.
She told him not to be afraid.	Se fertelde him net bang te wêzen.
I wish she was still here.	Ik winskje dat se hjir noch wie.
Have some faith.	Hawwe wat leauwe.
You do not have to be one of those people.	Jo hoege net ien fan dy minsken te wêzen.
There is no way around this.	Der is gjin wei om dit hinne.
It would be easy to give up.	It soe maklik wêze om op te jaan.
The children be careful.	De bern wês foarsichtich.
I want my kids to be the best at what they do.	Ik wol dat myn bern de bêste binne yn wat se dogge.
Let's make something.	Litte wy wat meitsje.
We become more of who we are.	Wy wurde mear fan wa't wy binne.
Whoever does not do so will never.	Wa't dat net docht, sil noait.
Maybe her plan would really work after all.	Miskien soe har plan nei alle gedachten echt wurkje.
I need her help.	Ik haw har help nedich.
He liked some of his money.	Hy mocht fan syn jild.
Well, that would obviously not happen.	No, dat soe fansels net barre.
And they just come through.	En se komme gewoan troch.
They will find him if we do not find him first.	Se sille him fine as wy him earst net fine.
I love getting them.	Ik hâld fan har te krijen.
But she would not.	Mar se soe net.
He bought a book.	Hy kocht in boek.
I could not have asked for more.	Ik koe net hawwe frege om mear.
No one is in the class.	Gjinien is yn 'e klasse.
They are late for work.	Se binne te let op it wurk.
To be careful with my words.	Om foarsichtich te wêzen mei myn wurden.
Only if you want of course.	Allinnich as jo wolle fansels.
All you have to do is show up.	Alles wat jo hoege te dwaan is sjen litte.
But it never came back.	Mar it kaam nea wer.
But not over and over and over.	Mar net oer en oer en oer.
I took no chances.	Ik naam gjin kâns.
She looked for help.	Se seach om help.
The question then is not whether, but when and where.	De fraach is dan net oft, mar wannear en wêr.
She was sure there was none.	Se wie der wis fan dat der net wie.
And that's just water.	En dat is gewoan wetter.
But first things first.	Mar earst dingen earst.
Neither of us knew what was going on.	Net ien fan ús wist wat der oan de hân wie.
They also may not be happy to see me.	Se kinne ek net bliid wêze om my te sjen.
We are working on that.	Dêr wurdt oan wurke.
Until then, all the time.	Oant dan, de hiele tiid.
Go play that.	Gean dat spylje.
At home, that's easy.	Thús is dat maklik.
He's a bad man.	Hy is in min man.
She's better at it than I am.	Se is der better yn as ik.
This is my house now.	Dit is no myn hûs.
The truth is that no one really does.	De wierheid is dat gjinien it echt makket.
I'm a mom now.	Ik bin no in mem.
It just doesn’t stop there.	It hâldt gewoan net op.
In the other.	Yn de oare.
I hope you have me.	Ik hoopje dat jo my hawwe.
It has to happen.	It moat barre.
Neither works.	Gjin fan beide wurket.
She had done more.	Se hie mear dien.
She was a person.	Se wie in persoan.
It had no chance.	It hie gjin kâns.
She was sure of it.	Se hie der wis fan.
I'm a boy	Ik bin in jonge
We have not.	Wy ha net.
See that she is doing well.	Sjoch dat se goed docht.
She heard nothing.	Se hearde neat.
That's not bad, but it's not good either.	Dat is net min, mar it is ek net goed.
No one had to worry about a job.	Gjinien hie te soargen oer in baan.
There is not really much good work.	Der is net echt folle goed wurk.
They do it really well.	Se dogge it echt goed.
I'm really tired today.	Ik bin echt wurch hjoed.
It does not matter.	It makket neat út.
But on !!!.	Mar op!!!.
One of you?	Ien fan dy?
They do not pay you enough.	Se betelje jo net genôch.
I've seen them do just that.	Ik haw se dat krekt dwaan sjoen.
And you should see them here.	En jo moatte har hjir sjen.
You know more than they do.	Jo witte mear as se dogge.
He could too.	Hy koe ek wol.
Looks like you'll get your chance.	It liket derop dat jo jo kâns krije.
She was as beautiful as ever.	Se wie sa moai as altyd.
Keep our hair long.	Hâld ús hier lang.
It is still so today.	It is hjoed noch sa.
Only money does.	Allinnich jild docht.
He could not believe he said that.	Hy koe net leauwe dat er dat sei.
Nothing came in.	Der kaam neat yn.
Thought for sure.	Tocht wis.
Not this time.	Dizze kear net.
Of course, it was not easy to get there.	Fansels wie it net maklik om dêr te kommen.
That is absolutely true.	Dat is hielendal wier.
Now about the boy.	No oer de jonge.
It was hard for me.	It wie dreech foar my.
The best friend a man ever had.	De bêste freon in man ea hie.
He was with two of his friends.	Hy wie mei twa fan syn freonen.
I'm really looking forward to this.	Ik sjoch hjir eins út nei.
That's here.	Dat is hjir.
Nobody knows.	Nimmen wit it.
There comes a time for that.	Dêr komt in tiid foar.
His mother took over my house and my children.	Syn mem naam myn hûs en myn bern oer.
Maybe nothing happened.	Miskien wie der neat fan bard.
They will be afraid of him.	Se sille bang wêze foar him.
He could not see any of it.	Hy koe der net ien fan sjen.
There is me, and there you are.	Dêr is my, en dêr binne jo.
His parents are very ill.	Syn âlden binne tige siik.
But she could not, she knew that.	Mar se koe net, dat wist se.
It's just the truth.	It is gewoan de wierheid.
I hope you do too !.	Ik hoopje dat dy ek docht!.
They needed their parents.	Se hiene har âlden nedich.
It's like they asked for it.	It is as hawwe se der om frege.
That she could not let happen.	Dat koe se net barre litte.
But it did the job.	Mar it hat it wurk dien.
I was the guy who made that happen.	Ik wie de keardel dy't makke dat barre.
But she was not sure why.	Mar se wie net wis wêrom.
The three children said not a word.	De trije bern seine gjin wurd.
Neither do I, man.	Ik ek net, man.
She can be seen.	Se is te sjen.
Now go to bed and come back early.	No gean op bêd en kom betiid werom.
I could be more, be better.	Ik koe mear wêze, better wêze.
He would have her.	Hy soe har hawwe.
I had gone to see her.	Ik hie gean om har te sjen.
I'm having problems.	Ik haw problemen.
You go with him.	Jo geane mei him.
And he did not give it to me either.	En hy joech it my ek net.
There will be no problems.	Der sil gjin problemen wêze.
Life, then nothing.	It libben, dan neat.
It makes you think these people know what they are doing.	It lit jo tinke dat dizze minsken witte wat se dogge.
Hope you get the idea.	Hoopje dat jo it idee krije.
Not this child.	Dit bern net.
This has been decided.	Dit is besletten.
Please remember to eat.	Tink asjebleaft om te iten.
You will think something.	Jo sille wat tinke.
You can tell them as much or as little as you want.	Jo kinne har safolle of sa min fertelle as jo wolle.
I do not want you.	Ik wol dy net.
I'm sure you can.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo it kinne.
That's exactly what happened.	Dat is krekt wat bard.
Hope it gets better.	Hoopje dat it better wurdt.
This is exactly the same thing.	Dit is krekt itselde ding.
No one tried to stop her.	Nimmen besocht har tsjin te hâlden.
You are one.	Do bist ien.
It was too early for that.	Dêr wie it te betiid foar.
It's beautiful here.	It is hjir moai.
He persuaded her to come back.	Hy oertsjûge har om werom te kommen.
The same can be said here.	Itselde kin hjir sein wurde.
She did not have that, and so she did not know what to say.	Dat hie se net, en sa wist se net wat se sizze moast.
Only one came.	Der is mar ien kommen.
He could be of great help to us.	Hy koe ús fan grutte help wêze.
He wanted to know why.	Hy woe witte wêrom.
They would probably try.	Se soene wierskynlik besykje.
I see him well then.	Ik sjoch him dan goed.
You know it will.	Jo witte it wol.
Never heard of him.	Nea fan him heard.
It's too hard.	It is te dreech.
Everyone knows now.	Elkenien wit no.
You look like one now.	Jo lykje no wol op ien.
Want to try a lot of new things !.	Wolle jo in protte nije dingen besykje!.
She opened the door again.	Se die de doar wer iepen.
Long ago no.	Lang lyn no.
But we have to take them together.	Mar wy moatte se tegearre nimme.
But nobody really wants that.	Mar nimmen wol dat eins.
He really did not care about or around her.	Hy joech eins net om of om har.
One or two.	Ien of twa.
It does not go away.	It giet net fuort.
She looked ready.	Se seach in ree.
Just by looking.	Krekt troch te sjen.
If money is needed, give it.	As jild nedich is, jou it dan.
You have me.	Do hast my.
Make a seat, please.	Meitsje in sit, asjebleaft.
If he wants to talk, he can go first.	As er prate wol, kin er earst gean.
Mine will not be.	Myn sil net wêze.
I do not want you to do anything for me.	Ik wol net dat jo neat foar my dogge.
It was never about me.	It gie noait oer my.
She has to go to work every day.	Se moat alle dagen nei it wurk.
I heard them.	Ik hearde se.
I look at my hand.	Ik sjoch nei myn hân.
It's easy to do.	It is maklik om te dwaan.
Not even who you were.	Net iens wa't jo wiene.
I love the dog too.	Ik hâld fan de hûn ek.
I can not believe she did this to me.	Ik kin net leauwe dat se dit my dien hat.
That we love him.	Dat wy fan him hâlde.
I have to tell your mother the truth.	Ik moat dyn mem de wierheid fertelle.
They were good people.	It wiene goede minsken.
It was the same with me.	It wie mei my itselde.
A little over a year he had been here.	In bytsje mear as in jier hie er hjir west.
It was not a family.	It wie gjin famylje.
I was good at it.	Ik wie der goed yn.
I'll be back next year.	Ik kom takom jier werom.
I still have to work.	Ik moat noch wurkje.
You're still you.	Do bist noch altyd dy.
I had this.	Ik hie dit.
That, this is both.	Dat, dit is beide.
In other words, absolutely none.	Mei oare wurden, hielendal gjinien.
They are all gone.	Se binne allegear fuort.
I know, but.	Ik wit, mar.
I've never done that before.	Dat haw ik noch noait earder dien.
This was for a better me.	Dit wie foar in better my.
That should stop.	Dat moat ophâlde.
He's done it before.	Hy hat it earder dien.
He would do all the work.	Hy soe al it wurk dwaan.
We have no place to go.	Wy hawwe gjin plak om te gean.
They had done it well so far.	Se hiene it oant no ta goed dien.
It was good, even.	It wie goed, sels.
It never does.	It docht noait.
If you leave them.	As jo ​​se litte.
You had worried me there.	Do hiest my dêr soargen makke.
We talk for hours.	Wy prate oeren.
I'm having some problems.	Ik haw wat problemen.
I wonder which of us it is.	Ik freegje my ôf wa fan ús it is.
Well, it will be done.	No, it sil dien wurde.
He never does.	Dat docht er noait.
The police were surprised.	De plysje wie ferrast.
I thought we had.	Ik tocht dat wy hiene.
An alarm clock wakes her up.	In wekker makket se wekker.
He still has a house there.	Hy hat dêr noch in hûs.
They stick to it hard.	Se hâlde der hurd oan.
She seemed a little angry.	Se like wat lilk te wêzen.
I know nothing about it.	Ik wit der neat fan.
It's hard to make friends.	It is dreech om freonen te meitsjen.
For me, this was always a problem.	Foar my wie dit altyd in probleem.
You've been around a long time.	Do bist al lang om.
We needed a better plan.	Wy hiene in better plan nedich.
I should never have gone to him.	Ik hie noait nei him gean moatten.
How can I do that.	Hoe kin ik dat dwaan.
This year may be different.	Dit jier kin oars.
I try and try and it does not work.	Ik besykje en besykje en it wurket net.
Your name.	Dyn namme.
I've been bad since it happened.	Ik bin min west sûnt it barde.
It never worked.	It hat noait wurke.
It's right there to be seen.	It is krekt dêr te sjen.
He will wake the child.	Hy sil it bern wekker meitsje.
Maybe they don’t.	Miskien dogge se net.
That is not always true.	Dat is net altyd wier.
And there may be.	En der kin wêze.
That was pretty clear.	Dat wie moai dúdlik.
He said he did not want to return.	Hy sei dat er net werom woe.
But she was nice too.	Mar se wie ek aardich.
I'm sure it is.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it is.
Nobody lived there.	Dêr wenne gjinien.
She left it in her car.	Se liet it yn har auto.
Now go away with you.	No gean fuort mei dy.
Also not what you seem to see.	Ek net wat jo lykje te sjen.
He's my dog.	Hy is myn hûn.
It was for me.	It wie foar my.
Let them be.	Lit har wêze.
I have not told anyone.	Ik haw it oan gjinien ferteld.
She was never long enough in.	Se wie noait lang genôch yn.
I'm not so sure it's true.	Ik bin der net sa wis fan dat it wier is.
He did that.	Hy hat dat dien.
I wanted away from her.	Ik woe fan har ôf.
They have waited long enough.	Se hawwe lang genôch wachte.
But until they do, we do not know.	Mar oant se dogge, witte wy it net.
There is absolutely nothing you can do about it.	D'r is hjir hielendal neat oan dwaan kinne.
You do not know for sure.	Dat witte jo net foar wis.
Now he needs money.	No hat er jild nedich.
Give it to him.	Jou it oan him.
I am against that.	Dêr bin ik tsjin.
The whole house is yours.	It hiele hûs is fan jo.
They have one book, and believe it.	Se hawwe ien boek, en leau it.
Why, she did not know.	Wêrom, wist se net.
Get ready now, get ready now, do not wait.	Meitsje jo no klear, meitsje jo no klear, wachtsje net.
It is unlikely that they are more.	It is net wierskynlik dat se mear binne.
I have so little of everything.	Ik haw sa'n bytsje fan alles.
She tried it too.	Se besocht it ek.
They were really old.	Se wiene echt âld.
He told his friends he would return, but he never did.	Hy fertelde syn freonen dat hy werom soe, mar hy die noait.
If you ever need a room, let me know.	As jo ​​ea nedich in keamer, lit it my witte.
Look around you.	Sjoch om jo wat.
Already there are days.	Al binne der dagen.
You had better leave.	Do hiest better fuort.
But maybe things are really different now.	Mar miskien binne dingen no echt oars.
To see.	Te sjen.
Lit as.	Lit as.
Somehow it was better tonight.	Op ien of oare manier wie it fannacht better.
You may or may not agree with this.	Jo kinne of miskien net iens mei dit.
She knew what was going on.	Se wist wat der wie.
They did not even say why they did this.	Se hawwe net iens sein wêrom't se dit diene.
Do not wait.	Wachtsje net.
It could go off.	It koe ôf.
That's what kind of question it is.	Dat is wat foar fraach it is.
But could not.	Mar koe net.
I can not talk to him.	Ik kin net mei him prate.
You have to leave them.	Jo moatte se litte.
Maybe it will.	Miskien wol it wol.
And you too, my friend.	En jo ek, myn freon.
If it's one or two people in the car, you pay more.	As it ien of twa minsken yn 'e auto is, betelje jo mear.
Just want to believe they know better.	Wol gewoan leauwe dat se better witte.
Am I it? 	Bin ik it?
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
But not only this.	Mar net allinnich dit.
I will not tell anyone who you are.	Ik sil gjinien fertelle wa't jo binne.
I feel for her too.	Ik fiel my ek mei har.
She had decided she would stop.	Se hie besletten dat se ophâlde soe.
It felt good.	It fielde goed.
Nothing us.	Neat ús.
And that was gone.	En dat wie fuort.
The food is bad.	It iten is min.
It's all for the best.	It is allegear foar it bêste.
There is no time now.	Der is no gjin tiid.
I wonder what they will find at his house.	Ik freegje my ôf wat se by syn hûs fine sille.
We can not make it.	Wy kinne it net meitsje.
It worried me.	It makke my soargen.
Come on, come on.	Kom no, kom no.
I would like to be seen.	Ik wol graach sjoen wurde.
And it just sat there.	En it siet der mar.
But she can not help it.	Mar se kin it net helpe.
You're wrong about him.	Do bist ferkeard oer him.
And maybe she was even angry.	En miskien wie se sels wol lilk.
This is my new car.	Dit is myn nije auto.
This is what will happen to us.	Dit is wat ús sil barre.
A great dog.	In grutte hûn.
But it's not true, not anymore.	Mar it is net wier, net mear.
We all had to deal with it.	Wy hiene der allegear mei te krijen.
She was a good one.	Se wie in goede ien.
He had done nothing wrong, she could see.	Hy hie neat ferkeard dien, dat koe se sjen.
Have you not seen him?	Hast him net sjoen?
Neither of us had seen that in him before.	Net ien fan ús hie dat earder yn him sjoen.
She would like to return home.	Se wol graach werom nei hûs.
She said this person was never seen again.	Se sei dat dizze persoan nea wer sjoen waard.
That you have never seen.	Dat jo noait sjoen hawwe.
This works.	Dizze wurket.
He said not a word.	Hy sei gjin wurd.
You do it or you do not do it.	Jo dogge it of jo dogge it net.
He wanted to give her everything.	Hy woe har alles jaan.
That was fine with her.	Dat wie goed mei har.
If only he could see.	As er mar sjen koe.
Your father was a good man.	Jo heit wie in goed man.
Nobody wanted to do that.	Nimmen woe dat dwaan.
I wondered why she was too late.	Ik frege my ôf wêrom't se te let wie.
Friend for taking a job.	Freon foar it nimmen fan in baan.
If you can keep it.	As jo ​​it hâlde kinne.
We do not have to talk.	Wy hoege net te praten.
But now we know how it worked.	Mar no witte wy hoe't it wurke.
That looks more like it.	Dat liket der mear op.
I had to.	Ik moast.
Not only that, but he is not sorry.	Net allinnich dat, mar hy is net spyt.
Everyone needs help.	Elkenien hat help nedich.
Not really, she said.	Net echt, sei se.
He knew what he was doing.	Hy wist wat er die.
He does this with the help of his family.	Hy docht dit mei help fan syn famylje.
I needed to be something more.	Ik moast wat mear wêze.
There is no plan.	Der is gjin plan.
It's just us.	It binne gewoan wy.
There were no bad things.	Der wiene gjin minne dingen.
Or maybe they had.	Of miskien hiene se.
We do not need his kind here.	Wy hawwe syn soarte hjir net nedich.
You can do so many things.	Jo kinne safolle dingen dwaan.
I'm coming back to the police.	Ik kom werom by de plysje.
But do not tell me.	Mar fertel my net.
I had to think about life.	Ik moast tinke oer it libben.
She had made good time.	Se hie goede tiid makke.
Long, long ago, things were very different.	Lang, lang lyn, dingen wiene hiel oars.
There were none.	Der wiene gjin.
I wonder what they had for food.	Ik freegje my ôf wat se foar iten hân hawwe.
She walks away with her life.	Se giet har libben fuort.
Other people have problems.	Oare minsken hawwe problemen.
He was interested in almost everything.	Hy wie ynteressearre yn hast alles.
But this was not.	Mar dit wie net.
But never talk.	Mar nea prate.
Then the journey continues.	Dan giet de tocht troch.
Not for the first time.	Net foar de earste kear.
I have only one hope.	Ik haw mar ien hope.
I have friends.	Ik haw freonen.
He just does not have to be with children.	Hy hoecht gewoan net by bern te wêzen.
Well, they did it great.	No, se diene it grutte.
Said she had not.	Sei se hie net.
We do not know what it is.	Wy witte net wat it is.
I looked and looked.	Ik seach en seach.
He should.	Hy soe moatte.
But even that will not be enough.	Mar ek dat sil net genôch wêze.
I never got away from her.	Ik kaam noait fan har ôf.
All the guy was doing was talking.	Alles wat de keardel die wie praten.
She's just not interested right now.	Se is no gewoan net ynteressearre.
These two things are not the same.	Dizze twa dingen binne net itselde.
Show some life.	Lit wat libben sjen.
This is just one.	Dit is mar ien.
I do not do it for my children.	Ik doch it net foar myn bern.
Wait for me to come out.	Wachtsje op my om út te kommen.
That was pretty nice too.	Dat wie ek moai moai.
It is not necessary for a woman to be beautiful.	It is net nedich foar in frou om moai te wêzen.
He should not have been here.	Hy hie hjir net wêze moatten.
But here something else happens.	Mar hjir bart wat oars.
We could not get through.	Wy koene der net troch.
He should do it.	Hy soe it dwaan moatte.
She really is in this movie.	Se is echt yn dizze film.
Thought she might have known something.	Tocht dat se miskien wat wist.
I do not ask much.	Ik freegje net folle.
They do not know how.	Se witte net hoe.
I do not need it.	Ik haw it net nedich.
So does she.	Dat docht se ek.
He walked back.	Hy rûn werom.
They will be better than nothing.	Se sille better wêze as neat.
He had to stay in jail.	Hy moast yn de finzenis bliuwe.
He was determined to speak for himself and be heard.	Hy wie besletten om foar himsels te praten en heard te wurden.
He told me that over and over again.	Hy fertelde my dat kear op kear.
A new time is upon us.	In nije tiid is op ús.
There's something here.	Der is wat hjir.
I'm really happy.	Ik bin echt bliid.
He wanted to ask, but had no time.	Hy woe freegje, mar hie gjin tiid.
That was no problem.	Dat wie gjin probleem.
It's not very much.	It is net hiel folle.
I had never been in there.	Ik hie der noait yn west.
Or they should not be.	Of se moatte net wêze.
It was like a prison.	It wie as finzenis.
I want it to be real.	Ik wol dat it echt is.
I want to be ready for them when they come.	Ik wol foar har klear wêze as se komme.
And she loves her job.	En se hâldt fan har wurk.
Actually, really good.	Eins, echt goed.
She would not see me.	Se soe my net sjen.
She tried to become the mother he needed.	Se besocht de mem te wurden dy't er nedich hie.
Not all of them, probably.	Net allegear, wierskynlik.
Can't speak against it.	Kin der net tsjin prate.
He said he did not do it.	Hy sei dat er it net dien hat.
Clearly that too.	Dúdlik dat ek.
A new car.	In nije auto.
If you've never tried it, now's the time.	As jo ​​​​it noait hawwe besocht, is it no de tiid.
I hope you knew that somehow.	Ik hoopje dat jo dat op ien of oare manier wisten.
I had nothing to do with it.	Ik hie der neat oan.
She said it was from you.	Se sei dat it fan dy wie.
Take your time too.	Nim jo tiid ek.
We can not be too late.	Wy kinne net te let wêze.
There is more life in the room.	Der is mear libben yn 'e keamer.
I love it too.	Ik hâld der ek fan.
If you do not, we will find another way.	As jo ​​​​dat net dogge, sille wy in oare manier fine.
I'm sure he felt something then.	Ik bin der wis fan dat er dan wat fielde.
He wanted her to.	Hy woe dat se soe.
I still remember his name.	Ik wit noch syn namme.
So did the following.	Sa die de folgjende.
He went to work.	Hy gie oan it wurk.
I kept trying to get it going.	Ik bleau besykje om it te gean.
She had been good at it.	Se hie der goed yn west.
The only thing is.	It ienige ding is.
I wish they knew that.	Ik woe dat se dat wisten.
There was nothing left for her.	Der wie neat mear foar har.
Or someone else.	Of immen oars.
This is not about me.	Dit giet net oer my.
I wanted to let him know that someone had found him.	Ik woe him witte dat immen him fûn hie.
You can do it or you can not do it.	Jo kinne it dwaan of jo kinne it net.
It was not yet clear what exactly she would say.	It wie noch net dúdlik wat se krekt sizze soe.
I wanted something more.	Ik woe wat mear.
They were not his friends.	Se wiene syn freonen net.
I wish.	Ik winskje.
And you're not the same man either.	En do bist ek net deselde man.
Life goes on for these people.	It libben giet troch foar dizze minsken.
We waited and waited, but no one came.	Wy wachte en wachte, mar gjinien kaam.
You come and clear out a lot.	Jo komme en dúdlik út in protte.
There was so much to do.	Der wie safolle te dwaan.
But questions remain.	Mar fragen bliuwe.
No one heard them.	Nimmen hearde se.
This is my room.	Dit is myn keamer.
If so, we're done.	As dat sa is, binne wy ​​klear.
Well, you look like one.	No, jo lykje as in.
You work on what you want.	Jo wurkje oan wat jo wolle.
Have a little time to see something different.	Haw in bytsje tiid om wat oars te sjen.
He would not know it either.	Hy soe it ek net witte.
If this had happened a few hours ago.	As dit hie bard in pear oeren lyn.
They are not really the same thing.	Se binne net echt itselde ding.
I'm not good at this.	Ik bin hjir net goed yn.
It's about school.	It giet om op skoalle.
He wished she would not do that.	Hy woe dat se dat net dwaan soe.
But they try to do it.	Mar se besykje it te dwaan.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
Take what you can but nothing at all anymore.	Nim wat jo kinne mar hielendal neat mear.
We knew better.	Wy wisten better.
They really tried.	Se hawwe echt besocht.
Everyone says this.	Elkenien seit dit.
He had one and then another.	Hy hie ien en dan noch ien.
When no one came, he went on.	Doe't der gjinien kaam, gie er troch.
The girl is not what she likes.	It famke is net wat se liket.
For a whole week.	Foar in hiele wike.
Must be careful.	Moatte foarsichtich wêze.
Neither did my father.	Myn heit ek net.
But otherwise there were only two.	Mar oars wiene it mar twa.
Both are very good.	Beide binne hiel goed.
But no one had asked her.	Mar nimmen hie har frege.
It has absolutely nothing to do with you.	It hat hielendal neat mei dy te krijen.
Need to make something.	Moat wat meitsje.
He would not show up.	Hy soe net sjen litte.
Must have a car of course.	Moat hawwe in auto fansels.
I was pleasantly surprised.	Ik wie bliid ferrast.
She was no longer there.	Se wie der net mear.
He left everything to his wife.	Hy liet alles oan syn frou oer.
You should see it here.	Jo moatte it hjir sjen.
It was more than enough for us.	It wie mear as genôch foar ús.
The bus is too late.	De bus is te let.
What are we talking about?	Wêr hawwe wy it oer?
I'll show you now.	Ik sil dy it no sjen litte.
He must be back now.	Hy moat no werom wêze.
You're better than this.	Jo binne better as dit.
She had also been, when first told.	Se hie ek west, doe't it earst fertelde.
I'm tired a few more times.	Ik bin noch in pear kear wurch.
Not so much.	Net safolle.
If she had anything to say, she said it.	As se wat te sizzen hie, sei se it.
That's what.	Dat is wat.
After about three hours we arrive.	Nei sa'n trije oeren komme wy oan.
It does not matter.	It makket neat út.
It came out.	It kaam út.
I can love you.	Ik kin fan dy hâlde.
As if it was waiting.	As hie it wachte.
I like it very much.	Ik hâld der tige fan.
And there will not be.	En der sil net wêze.
There's nothing else to talk about.	D'r is neat oars om oer te praten.
Neither wanted to leave the house.	Gjin fan beide woe it hûs út.
Same with me.	Itselde mei my.
We do not come to that question.	Wy komme net oan dy fraach.
I've been here for a month.	Ik bin hjir foar in moanne.
But you will not see her again in this life.	Mar jo sille har net mear sjen yn dit libben.
Two years ago.	Twa jier lyn.
Same last weekend at home.	Itselde ferline wykein thús.
Where he knew she was.	Wêr't er wist dat se wie.
It works for everyone.	It wurket foar elkenien.
Well, not at first.	No, earst net.
I never came across anyone.	Ik kaam noait op immen.
If it's too good to be true, it probably is.	As it te goed is om wier te wêzen, is it wierskynlik.
What good came out of it, and what bad.	Wat goed kaam der út, en wat min.
There was a chance.	Der wie in kâns.
But we have to do this.	Mar wy moatte dit dwaan.
It will not happen.	It sil net barre.
He wished he had not come.	Hy woe dat er net kommen wie.
Everything he had done for me all my life.	Alles wat hy myn libben lang foar my dien hie.
Well, that's easy then.	No, dat is dan maklik.
Bye bye!.	Oant sjen!.
They said they had not seen you.	Se seine dat se dy net sjoen hiene.
Now that's not a bad idea.	No dat is gjin min idee.
That's good.	Dat is goed.
He knew there was something else about him.	Hy wist dat der wat oars oan him wie.
Well, we do.	No, wy dogge.
Whatever happened was something more.	Wat der ek barde wie wat mear.
And then go and do that.	En dan gean en doch dat.
She was angry.	Se wie lilk.
Make new friends.	Meitsje nije freonen.
Mom didn't even know him that well.	Mem koe him net iens sa goed.
I can not do it.	Ik kin it net dwaan.
I was glad he did and I did not.	Ik wie bliid dat hy it die en ik net.
You will probably be fine.	Jo sille wierskynlik goed wêze.
Let me know if you like them.	Lit my witte as jo se leuk fine.
Life is good !.	Libben is goed!.
I myself am good.	Ik sels bin goed.
Everyone is happy, too happy.	Elkenien is bliid, te bliid.
Maybe he was not.	Miskien wie er net.
That's what it's about.	Dêr giet it om.
Not one woman.	Net ien frou.
Why are there so many words for hair?	Wêrom binne d'r safolle wurden foar hier?
He seemed surprised by this.	Hy like hjir ferrast troch.
Then be ready.	Wês dan klear.
We are one.	Wy binne ien.
We hold the belief that it will be different next time.	Wy hâlde it leauwe yn dat it de folgjende kear oars komt.
She was angry.	Se wie lilk.
That's not it either.	Dat is it ek net.
It met once a week for three hours.	It moete ien kear yn 'e wike foar trije oeren.
I wanted him to be happy.	Ik woe him bliid wêze.
I'm sure it was him.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it him wie.
I hope they help you too.	Ik hoopje dat se jo ek helpe.
He himself did not have much.	Hy hie sels net folle.
Afraid he might be, but he would not hold him anymore.	Bang dat er miskien wêze soe, mar hy soe him net mear hâlde.
Pick him up now.	Nim him no op.
There are no problems.	Der binne gjin problemen.
He was never away when needed.	Hy wie nea fuort as it nedich wie.
It has never been talked about.	Dêr is nea oer praat.
I think they still are not.	Ik tink dat se noch altyd net binne.
We talk to people who are with this person.	Wy prate mei minsken dy't mei dizze persoan binne.
What he saw was not real.	Wat hy seach wie net echt.
She met your father.	Se moete dyn heit.
But, that's really not much of it.	Mar, dat is der echt net folle fan.
I gave her money.	Ik joech har jild.
That will not be necessary, really.	Dat sil net nedich wêze, echt.
Many will never be the same.	In protte sille nea itselde wêze.
It's not easy.	It is net maklik.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Neat, neat, neat.
He did not look at her, or hear what she was saying.	Hy seach net nei har, of hearde wat se sei.
Never heard of her.	Nea heard fan har.
It was the first week of a new month.	It wie de earste wike fan in nije moanne.
You will not get me.	Jo sille my net krije.
The man was angry.	De man wie lilk.
This was not her room.	Dit wie har keamer net.
I have always loved my mother.	Ik haw altyd graach myn mem.
You have to look after people.	Jo moatte nei minsken sjen.
You can not do things.	Jo kinne gjin dingen dwaan.
I never did.	Ik haw noait dien.
One and done.	Ien en dien.
And so it was there early.	En sa wie it der al betiid.
I made it all up.	Ik makke dat alles op.
So it should not be.	Sa soe it net moatte.
But of course there was no time for that.	Mar dêr wie fansels gjin tiid foar.
I did not know where he was.	Ik wist net wêr't er wie.
Where did he go?	Wêr is hy hinne gien?
I told her everything.	Ik haw har alles ferteld.
But do not go there.	Gean der mar net hinne.
Just did not happen.	Krekt net bart.
His mother too.	Syn mem ek.
They do more harm.	Se dogge mear sear.
He may have been.	Hy kin west hawwe.
But not in this house.	Mar net yn dit hûs.
Well, good enough.	No, goed genôch.
Easy does it.	Maklik docht it.
Good to have a plan.	Goed om in plan te hawwen.
The only problem is how to do it.	It ienige probleem is hoe't jo it dwaan.
But that's not it.	Mar dat is it net.
I've been doing this for a long time.	Ik haw dit lang dien.
We need it.	Wy hawwe it nedich.
So far, this has yet to happen.	Oant no ta moat dit noch barre.
In the.	Yn de.
Well, soon he would know.	No, gau soe er it witte.
I hope no one heard.	Ik hope dat gjinien hearde.
You will not need anything else.	Jo sille neat oars nedich hawwe.
I could watch for hours and hours.	Ik koe oeren en oeren sjen.
I thought of nothing.	Ik tocht oan neat.
We have everything in hand.	Wy hawwe der alles yn hân.
It's even more than that.	It is noch mear as dat.
I was done for.	Ik wie dien foar.
They will still happen.	Se sille noch barre.
But no word on how this happened.	Mar gjin wurd oer hoe't dit barde.
He needed this weekend.	Hy hie dit wykein nedich.
This is already happening.	Dit bart al.
Do not give me out, man.	Jou my net út, man.
Do not pretend that you care about them.	Doch net as dat jo om har soargen hawwe.
No one is really sure how they work, or why.	Nimmen is echt wis hoe't se wurkje, of wêrom.
Not really interested in going with one other person either.	Net echt ynteressearre yn gean mei ien oare persoan ek.
I do not think it wants to go home !.	Ik tink net dat it wol nei hûs!.
It can be fun.	It kin wêze leuk.
That is different from faith.	Dat is oars as leauwe.
They think you're better off.	Se tinke dat jo better binne.
The moon is visible tonight.	De moanne is fannacht te sjen.
She loves you.	Se hâld fan dy.
It can put people in place.	It kin minsken op it plak sette.
I do not want to do these things.	Ik wol dizze dingen net dwaan.
This really got me home today.	Dit kaam my hjoed echt thús.
His wife came out just as bad.	Syn frou kaam der like min út.
It's a really good thing, really, really good.	It is in echt goed ding, echt, echt goed.
I just believe you are very much wrong.	Ik leau gewoan dat jo in protte ferkeard binne.
Had to get out of the way, had to.	Moast út 'e wei gean, moast.
There is much more to do and say.	Der is folle mear te dwaan en te sizzen.
She said you were in trouble.	Se sei dat jo yn de problemen wiene.
Other than that, nothing really.	Oars as dat, neat echt.
There he asked himself.	Dêr frege er him ôf.
I think he is, a little bit.	Ik tink dat hy is, in bytsje.
I need to be with you.	Ik moat by dy wêze.
Here she is.	Hjir is se.
That, of course, is good.	Dat is fansels goed.
It just came off.	It kaam gewoan ôf.
You have worked for so long.	Jo hawwe sa lang wurke.
I liked it quite a bit.	Ik fûn it aardich leuk.
Who he was.	Wa't hy wie.
I am for my plan.	Ik bin foar myn plan.
Tell me what it said.	Fertel my wat it sei.
It was so much better, she thought.	It wie sa better, tocht se.
It may be a bit long, but that does not matter.	It kin wat lang wêze, mar dat makket neat út.
But no one knew.	Mar nimmen wist er.
I could tell you what it is.	Ik koe dy fertelle wat it ek is.
There will still be work to be done.	Der sil noch wurke wurde.
If life goes well, not much is made of it.	As it libben goed giet, wurdt der net folle fan makke.
Good at what he did too.	Goed yn wat hy die ek.
That you need to know.	Dat moatte jo witte.
It still is.	It is noch altyd.
And he would not let it happen again.	En hy soe it net wer barre litte.
I have to stay out of the way.	Ik moat út 'e wei bliuwe.
Maybe you can talk to her.	Miskien kinne jo mei har prate.
He had many friends.	Hy hie in protte freonen.
Same every day.	Itselde alle dagen.
Of course she was.	Fansels wie se.
We also need to look at the work that it does.	Wy moatte ek sjen nei it wurk dat it docht.
He loves many things.	Hy hâldt fan in protte dingen.
It's not so much.	It is net sa folle.
A man who opened.	In man die iepen.
Of course he knew where they were.	Fansels wist hy wêr't se wiene.
With much more to come.	Mei folle mear te kommen.
Over and over.	Oer en oer.
I was so angry.	Ik wie sa lilk.
My mom told me last year.	Myn mem fertelde my ferline jier.
He was sure he had seen this before.	Hy wie der wis fan dat er dit earder sjoen hie.
I would have his bed again.	Ik soe syn bêd wer ha.
Exactly, not the best.	Krekt, net de bêste.
But they can do it.	Mar se kinne it dwaan.
It does not look like anything else.	It liket der net op wat oars.
Before we even met.	Foardat wy sels moete.
You would not believe that he just wanted to see what it was like.	Jo soene net leauwe dat hy gewoan sjen woe hoe't it wie.
This can not.	Dit kin net.
Everyone saw it.	Elkenien seach it.
My husband had not said anything to me about it.	Myn man hie der neat fan tsjin my sein.
Let's take a chance.	Lit ús in kâns nimme.
It was a whole year.	It wie in hiel jier.
I've never seen him.	Ik haw him nea sjoen.
She asked me not to tell her husband.	Se frege my om har man net te fertellen.
I had been here before, in my first week, and found nothing.	Ik hie hjir earder west, yn myn earste wike, en fûn neat.
There is a problem.	Dêr is in probleem.
It was not his place.	It wie net syn plak.
Good food, too.	Goed iten, te.
I'm not sure exactly.	Ik bin net wis krekt.
This year just family.	Dit jier gewoan famylje.
They never told me.	Se hawwe it my noait ferteld.
Take care of it another time.	Soargje der in oare kear oer.
Have you seen this before?	Hawwe jo dizze mar earder sjoen?
Neither was willing to give up.	Gjin fan beide wie ree om te jaan.
About what he found a little over a month ago.	Oer wat er in bytsje mear as in moanne lyn fûn.
Well, it's ready.	No, it is klear.
You and I, it could still happen.	Do en ik, it koe noch wol.
But they do not work for me.	Mar se dogge net foar my.
I could not say it.	Ik koe it net sizze.
It's been so long ago.	It is sa lang lyn.
She should have seen it.	Se hie it sjen moatten.
This was the best thing ever.	Dit wie it bêste ding ea.
Show and tell.	Lit sjen en fertel.
They never pay out.	Se betelje noait út.
For the new movie.	Foar de nije film.
This was not a man who did not tell his wife often.	Dit wie net in man dy't syn frou net faak fertelde.
Two days to be exact.	Twa dagen om krekt te wêzen.
They had done nothing.	Se hiene neat dien.
I'll take you back on your way, look.	Ik nim dy werom op dyn wei, sjoch.
I told her again.	Ik fertelde har wer.
He once told me it would not be a problem.	Hy fertelde my ien kear dat it gjin probleem soe wêze.
It's about doing it differently.	It giet om it oars dwaan.
Everything would be fine now.	Alles soe no goed komme.
And you're too late.	En do bist te let.
And be with you.	En by dy wêze.
There may be some sort of opportunity.	Dêr kin in soarte fan kâns wêze.
I want people to go for it.	Ik wol dat minsken der foar gean moatte.
I did not ask him to do that.	Ik haw him der net nei frege.
The name is bad.	De namme is min.
You think he will do one thing and he will do the other.	Jo tinke dat hy ien ding sil dwaan en hy sil it oare dwaan.
You need to know that too.	Dat moatte jo ek witte.
We talk about everything.	Wy prate oer alles.
You will never find him.	Jo sille him noait fine.
At school, it was difficult at first, he says.	Op skoalle wie it earst dreech, seit er.
I met with problem.	Ik moete mei probleem.
School was not the same.	Skoalle wie net itselde.
I'm leaving tomorrow.	Ik gean moarn fuort.
I really love you.	Ik hâld echt fan dy.
Here's an idea.	Hjir is in idee.
But there it was again.	Mar dêr wie it wer.
We want such a man.	Wy wolle sa'n man.
She was always busy.	Se wie altyd drok.
This is what we know for sure.	Dit is wat wy wis witte.
He did not know whether this place was true or not.	Hy koe net, oft dit plak wier wie of net.
This is one of your best.	Dit is ien fan jo bêste.
It does not do what it says.	It docht net wat it seit.
I do not know if he was or not.	Ik wit net oft hy wie of net.
They need to get away.	Dy moatte fuort.
We've never been here before.	Wy hawwe hjir noch nea west.
She wanted that life.	Se woe dat libben.
He wants to eat with you too.	Hy wol ek mei dy ite.
You do not know how much.	Jo witte net hoefolle.
Come on, work with me on this.	Kom op, wurkje hjir mei my oan.
I see them coming.	Ik sjoch se komme.
Until he wanted them to know who he was.	Oant er woe dat se witte wa't er wie.
I'm a young woman.	Ik bin in jonge frou.
Food and water would soon become a problem.	Iten en wetter soene gau in probleem wurde.
I'm sorry to say that.	It spyt my om dat te sizzen.
She never got over it.	Se is der nea oer kaam.
I believe it's wrong.	Ik leau dat it ferkeard is.
I do not know who.	Ik wit net fan wa.
I looked at him.	Ik seach nei him.
He quickly looked through the room.	Hy seach gau de keamer troch.
But this is out of the question.	Mar dit is út 'e fraach.
Tonight you are just very careful with him again.	Jûn binne jo gewoan wer tige foarsichtich mei him.
But there is more to it.	Mar der is mear oan it.
I do not want to leave.	Ik wol net fuort.
I did not know that either.	Dat wist ik ek net.
Not much else.	Net folle oars.
But it's more, much more.	Mar it is mear, folle mear.
That's what everyone always said.	Dat sei elkenien altyd.
He realized that his father loved him.	Hy realisearre dat syn heit fan him hâlde.
He did not often get angry.	Hy waard net faak lilk.
That is what is so difficult.	Dat is wat sa dreech is.
Do the right thing.	It goede ding dwaan.
How she wanted him.	Hoe't se him woe.
Here it is.	Hjir is it.
He loves no one.	Hy hâldt fan gjinien.
Maybe even a word of regret.	Miskien sels in wurd fan spyt.
In fact, she was not angry at him.	Eins wie se net lilk op him.
We know where to look.	Wy witte wêr te sjen.
Not a dog, or a.	Net in hûn, of in.
I do not know what that would be.	Ik wit net wat dat wêze soe.
Then everything should work.	Dan moat alles wurkje.
And we can talk.	En wy kinne prate.
There is still so much to be done.	Der moat noch safolle dien wurde.
So far, so good.	Oant no ta wurket alles goed.
I do not want.	Ik wol net.
So did I.	Dat die ik ek.
It's coming soon.	It komt gau.
Everything still looked good.	Alles seach der noch goed út.
It seemed just so much.	It like krekt sa folle.
You have to see him.	Jo moatte him sjen.
Nothing sick about him.	Neat siik oer him.
He tried to say something.	Hy besocht wat te sizzen.
I want to give you everything of mine.	Ik wol dy alles fan my jaan.
It's so beautiful.	It is sa moai.
She knew better now.	Se wist no better.
You did.	Do hast hân .
They can just show it and anyone can get it.	Se kinne gewoan sjen litte en elkenien kin it krije.
But there are plenty of other things that do.	Mar d'r binne genôch oare dingen dy't dogge.
I was for the other guy.	Ik wie foar de oare keardel.
Her mother is one of my mother's best friends.	Har mem is ien fan myn mem syn bêste freonen.
I've never seen him before.	Ik haw him noch noait earder sjoen.
You'll get over it.	Jo komme der wol oer.
You never will.	Jo sille nea.
For the first time we are free.	Foar it earst binne wy ​​frij.
We need to help her.	Wy moatte har helpe.
Not if you do not want to.	Net as jo net wolle.
It is 'in itself so'.	It is 'op himsels sa'.
How much water do you need?	Hoefolle wetter hawwe jo nedich?
I very much agree with that.	Ik bin it tige mei iens.
Home too.	Thús ek.
In fact, that is not enough.	Eins is dat net genôch.
He had met someone.	Hy hie immen moete.
There I love him.	Dêr hâld ik fan him.
It's time to wake up!	It is tiid om wekker te wurden!
There is nothing about that.	Dêr is neat fan oer.
That stayed with me forever.	Dat bleau my foar altyd by.
That put us in a very bad place.	Dat sette ús op in hiel min plak.
But he could not.	Mar hy koe it net.
He was sure of that.	Dêr wie er wis fan.
Sit now too long.	Sit no te lang.
I was, really.	Ik wie, echt.
But we can no longer be sure.	Mar wy kinne net mear wis wêze.
That's what you did.	Dat hawwe jo dien.
But not this man.	Mar net dizze man.
But you just can not.	Mar jo kinne gewoan net.
He was now the man of the house.	Hy wie no de man fan it hûs.
Here we are two days out.	Hjir binne wy ​​twa dagen út.
I'm not there now.	Ik bin der no net.
Show her how much of a man you are.	Lit har sjen hoefolle fan in man do bist.
But this time, she really had nothing to do with it.	Mar dizze kear hie se der eins neat oan.
He could still.	Hy koe noch.
It does not have to be a friend.	It hoecht gjin freon te wêzen.
You will be surprised by the things that come your way.	Jo sille ferrast wurde troch de dingen dy't jo wei komme.
It seemed so old.	It like sa âld.
He works for both of us.	Hy wurket foar ús beide.
Do not ask me who.	Freegje my net wa.
We'll see you next year.	Wy sille takom jier sjen.
But it was not there.	Mar it wie der net.
Of course, my kids want to know why they are asking.	Fansels wolle myn bern witte wêrom't se freegje.
It's so different and so much the same.	It is sa oars en safolle itselde.
Do you want to ask my mother?	Wolle jo myn mem freegje?
Come home early.	Kom betiid thús.
You know, they do a lot of things right now.	Jo witte, se dogge no in protte dingen.
I still do not feel ready to deal with him.	Ik fiel my noch net ree om mei him om te gean.
I worked really hard.	Ik wurke echt hurd.
Many people find it difficult.	In protte minsken it is dreech.
She had to wait.	Se moast wachtsje.
There was not much talk.	Der waard net folle praat.
But it was not a car.	Mar it wie gjin auto.
I would not hurt her.	Ik soe har net sear dwaan.
Can find a place here.	Kin hjir in plak fine.
So did we last year.	Dat diene wy ​​ferline jier ek.
You can just tell by looking at me.	Jo kinne gewoan fertelle troch nei my te sjen.
Or if you are not in this city, another like it.	Of as jo net yn dizze stêd binne, in oare like it.
You are a people person.	Do bist in minsken persoan.
She can not do without her.	Se kin net sûnder har.
I had not seen anyone play that way.	Ik hie gjinien op dy manier spylje sjoen.
He told her a little about his family.	Hy fertelde har in bytsje oer syn famylje.
I can not see it clearly.	Ik kin it net dúdlik sjen.
The police were quickly on the scene.	De plysje wie gau op it plak.
It happened right after this talk.	It barde fuort nei dit praat.
But he could not, not yet.	Mar hy koe net, noch net.
Tomorrow has every chance of a better day.	Moarn hat alle kâns op in bettere dei.
He looked at his hand.	Hy seach nei syn hân.
Have been my whole life.	Ha west myn hiele libben.
But it soon took over the whole house.	Mar it naam al gau it hiele hûs oer.
I could never do it again.	Ik koe it noait wer dwaan.
You make me both think.	Jo litte my beide tinke.
Just what she did not want.	Krekt wat se net woe.
You know how those things go.	Jo witte hoe't dy dingen gean.
But for us, life was the same.	Mar foar ús wie it libben itselde.
It's never easy.	It is nea maklik.
I do not know what to think of it.	Ik wit net wat ik der fan tinke moat.
Nothing had worked before.	Neat hie earder wurke.
Do not worry about it.	Sit der gjin soargen oer.
He was not like that.	Hy wie net sa.
I've never done that, and I never will.	Dat haw ik noait dien, en dat sil ik noait.
He did not have that.	Dat hie er net.
They should have and should talk about it.	Se moatte hawwe en moatte prate oer it.
These people.	Dizze minsken.
Maybe she did not.	Miskien hie se it net.
We do not want to go back there.	Dêr wolle wy net werom.
And we can look at that.	En dêr kinne wy ​​nei sjen.
There is much more to go.	Der binne noch folle mear te gean.
Says he has to leave.	Seit dat er fuort moat.
But if she did not.	Mar as se it net die.
It was so good.	It wie sa goed.
I just did not see it.	Ik haw it gewoan net sjoen.
You are sure to win one day.	Jo binne wis dat jo ien dei sille winne.
They do not arrive on time.	Se komme net op 'e tiid.
I do not know how it works, but it works.	Ik wit net hoe't it wurket, mar it wurket.
I really want this.	Ik wol dit echt.
Let everyone know.	Lit elkenien witte.
I have no idea who you are.	Ik ha gjin idee wa't jo binne.
It could be tomorrow.	It kin moarn wêze.
This works very well.	Dit wurket hiel goed.
Work here today.	Hjir wurkje hjoed.
And there it started.	En dêr begûn it mar.
I'm sure you do too.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo ek dogge.
They love their work.	Se hâlde fan har wurk.
This actually happened.	Dit is eins bard.
We are next.	Wy binne folgjende.
But it took off.	Mar it naam ôf.
They do not say.	Se sizze net.
He seems clear to me.	Hy liket my dúdlik.
Everything she wanted was out there.	Alles wat se woe, wie der út.
That's a lot, but not enough.	Dat is in protte, mar net genôch.
Life stands in the way.	It libben stiet yn 'e wei.
He looked at his mother.	Hy seach nei syn mem.
I do not know what will happen tomorrow.	Ik wit net wat der moarn barre sil.
She felt very sick.	Se fielde har tige siik.
But this, this is different.	Mar dit, dit is oars.
I thought we would never get here.	Ik tocht dat wy hjir noait komme soene.
This is for you.	Dizze is foar jo.
Everyone thought the same.	Elkenien tocht itselde.
He knows how to take care of himself.	Hy wit hoe't er foar himsels soargje moat.
Well, not exactly, of course.	No, net krekt, fansels.
I would be so happy to find it a home.	Ik soe sa bliid wêze om it in hûs te finen.
If they want to do it, fine.	As se it dwaan wolle, goed.
She probably had.	Se hie wierskynlik.
And he got it.	En hy krige it.
He was the man.	Hy wie de man.
I did not know about that.	Dêr wist ik net fan.
Neither has been hit.	Gjin fan beide is rekke.
Dad walked into the room.	Heit rûn de keamer yn.
I'm not late.	Ik kom net te let.
I did not feel well.	Ik fielde my net goed.
A few more words, and here he is.	Noch in pear wurden, en hjir is hy.
But come on in.	Mar kom yn.
They just do nothing.	Se dogge gewoan neat.
I do not feel tired.	Ik fiel my net wurch.
I did it for a year.	Ik die it foar in jier.
He also wanted to be convinced.	Hy woe ek oertsjûge wurde.
It does not stop there.	Dêr hâldt it net op.
I can tell you so much.	Ik kin safolle fertelle.
Was there to help him.	Wie der om him te helpen.
They can be found here.	Se binne hjir te finen.
Nobody wanted to know anything.	Nimmen woe wat witte.
And not only that.	En net allinnich dat.
I will wait for you.	Ik sil op dy wachtsje.
It's easy to figure out what happened yesterday.	It is maklik om út te finen wat der juster bard is.
To make it real you have to love people.	Om it echt te meitsjen moatte jo fan minsken hâlde.
Just one of the first.	Krekt ien fan de earste.
This is who we come from.	Dit is fan wa't wy komme.
Things happen, people talk, word comes out.	Dingen barre, minsken prate, wurd komt út.
That's pretty much all anyone has ever said to me.	Dat is sa'n bytsje alles wat immen ea tsjin my sei.
We need to get better.	Wy moatte better wurde.
Today is the last day of school.	Hjoed is de lêste dei fan skoalle.
He's a dog.	Hy is in hûn.
She had to be.	Se moast wêze.
We know it now.	Wy witte it no.
See you then!.	Sjoch dy dan!.
I had enough of the bus one day.	Ik hie ien dei genôch fan de bus.
, if and when needed.	, as en wannear nedich.
He opened the book and began to read.	Hy die it boek iepen en begûn te lêzen.
That is very different.	Dat is hiel oars.
I can not be sure.	Ik kin der net wis fan wêze.
She made me happy.	Se makke my bliid.
I was scared and so was he, but we were scared together.	Ik wie bang en hy ek, mar wy wiene bang tegearre.
You know this is for the best.	Jo witte dat dit foar it bêste is.
I do not think it's good.	Ik tink net dat it goed is.
His mother wanted to do something to him.	Syn mem woe him wat dwaan.
I know you are.	Ik wit it do bist.
It was the book he wanted.	It wie it boek dat hy woe.
I have a job now.	Ik haw no in baan.
She can say nothing to hurt you.	Se kin neat sizze om dy sear te dwaan.
I did not even know it was coming.	Ik wist net iens dat it komme soe.
Friends know these things about each other.	Freonen witte dizze dingen oer elkoar.
I look down on you.	Ik sjoch dy ôf.
It was good, but it could be better.	It wie goed, mar it koe better.
It was obviously not here.	It wie hjir fansels net.
Everyone he.	Elkenien hy.
I'm here now.	Ik bin hjir no.
When he felt better, time was enough.	Doe't er him better fielde, wie tiid genôch.
We were up first.	Wy wiene earst op.
I need to go for help.	Ik moat foar help gean.
That had to be something, he said to himself.	Dat moast wat wurde, sei er tsjin himsels.
He tried to talk again too soon.	Hy besocht te gau wer te praten.
It does not have to be much.	It hoecht net folle te wêzen.
I'm here with my friend.	Ik bin hjir mei myn freon.
He must be.	Hy moat wêze.
We will help to make that new life fun.	Wy sille helpe om dat nije libben leuk te meitsjen.
I have enough to worry about without this.	Ik haw genôch om soargen oer sûnder dit.
So he had been.	Sa hie er west.
It would give me time.	It soe my tiid jaan.
He does not worry.	Hy makket him gjin soargen.
You hope something goes wrong.	Jo hoopje dat der wat fuort giet.
People think more of other things.	Minsken tinke mear oan oare dingen.
That's what she thought.	Dat tocht se.
He will do us no harm.	Hy sil ús neat dwaan.
It did not seem like much.	It like net folle.
This he could with, this was more.	Dit koe er mei, dit wie mear.
I just was not ready to tell him everything.	Ik wie gewoan net ree om him alles te fertellen.
He need say no more.	Mear hoecht er net te sizzen.
Quite a bit actually.	Hiel wat eins.
Why you should.	Wêrom moatte jo.
For a whole day.	Foar in hiele dei.
By that time, it did not matter.	Tsjin dy tiid makke it neat út.
I'm sure it will show.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it sil sjen litte.
But he could not, not yet at all.	Mar hy koe net, noch net hielendal.
Nobody knows.	Nimmen wit it.
Well, there is nothing like that.	No, der is neat as dat.
Not that it was necessary.	Net dat it nedich wie.
This was my last day at work.	Dit wie myn lêste dei op it wurk.
You need to know where it is.	Jo moatte witte wêr't it is.
It is not difficult to do this.	It is net dreech om dit te dwaan.
Mine is not always as beautiful.	Myn is net altyd like moai.
The parents were ready to leave.	De âlden wiene ree om fuort te gean.
Really, there is.	Echt, der is.
Let's go back to town or something.	Litte wy werom nei de stêd of sa.
Can anyone please help me ?.	Kin immen my asjebleaft helpe?.
I know him better than you.	Ik ken him better as jo.
He was a teacher.	Hy wie learaar.
But do not go to trouble.	Mar gean net ta problemen.
When you buy it, you have it.	As jo ​​​​it keapje, hawwe jo it.
I would love him.	Ik soe fan him hâlde.
But here comes much more.	Mar hjir komt folle mear.
It's just to find the time and place.	It is gewoan om de tiid en it plak te finen.
Look after the children.	Sjoch nei de bern.
I should do my job.	Ik soe myn wurk dwaan moatte.
You're just trying to help.	Jo besykje gewoan te helpen.
One time was enough.	Ien kear wie genôch.
And today is your first day.	En hjoed is dyn earste dei.
They did not expect that.	Dat hiene se net ferwachte.
See how beautiful everyone looks.	Sjoch hoe moai elkenien sjocht.
He went to work.	Hy gie oan it wurk.
I love children and thought about becoming a teacher.	Ik hâld fan bern en tocht der wol oan om learaar te wurden.
And there's a dog.	En der is in hûn.
I think you'll become a good father.	Ik tink dat jo in goede heit wurde.
The city began to get them.	De stêd begûn har te krijen.
That she should have known.	Dat hie se witte moatten.
I probably should.	Ik soe wierskynlik moatte.
But no people.	Mar gjin minsken.
I would love for you to do that.	Ik soe graach wolle dat jo dat dogge.
I'm going back a few years, of course.	Ik gean fansels in pear jier werom.
We were husband and wife.	Wy wiene man en frou.
What could be this problem.	Wat kin dit probleem wêze.
Have it on !.	Hawwe it oan!.
I had no idea where to find it, how.	Ik hie gjin idee wêr te finen it, hoe.
He knew what she had to do.	Hy wist wat se dwaan moast.
No one was touched.	Nimmen rekke oan.
Don't have them.	Hawwe dy net.
Things would hold up if she could stay angry.	Dingen soene hâlde as se lilk bliuwe koe.
Where are they going? 	Wêr binne se hinne?
Or not by me.	Of net troch my.
But for now.	Mar foar no.
We have everything.	Wy hawwe alles.
Who lets you do your thing.	Wa lit dy dwaan dyn ding.
There he was now through.	Dêr wie er no troch.
They can see this.	Se kinne dit sjen.
He did not look well.	Hy seach der net goed út.
Well, her and mine.	No, har en myn.
She's still my mother.	Se is noch altyd myn mem.
He's one of those people.	Hy is ien fan dy minsken.
Hope that was of some help.	Hoopje dat wie fan wat help.
She's not that pretty.	Se is net sa moai.
At that time there was none	Yn dy tiid wie der gjinien
She does not have to say anything.	Se hoecht neat te sizzen.
I ask if she knows this woman, if she is the mother.	Ik freegje oft se dizze frou ken, as se de mem is.
There is nothing to do but wait.	Der is neat te dwaan as wachtsje.
Same as it is now.	Itselde as it no is.
I did not know them.	Ik koe se net.
It was so much to take in.	It wie safolle om yn te nimmen.
We let it go and let it be.	Wy litte it gean en litte it wêze.
Everything is getting better.	Alles wurde better.
You have to do everything you can.	Jo moatte alles dwaan wat jo kinne.
What is the word again?	Wat is it wurd ek wer?
And you know this.	En jo witte dit.
Friends working on this.	Freonen dy't wurkje oan dit.
Well, everyone knows it.	No, elkenien wit it.
You will also grow old.	Jo sille ek âld wurde.
I did not know how.	Ik wist net hoe.
That's the way to get more money.	Dat is de manier om mear jild te krijen.
There was nothing left but the truth.	Der wie neat mear oer as de wierheid.
These people need a lot of help, and where we are going.	Dizze minsken hawwe in protte help nedich, en wêr't wy hinne gean.
No one could really care for anyone else.	Nimmen koe echt soargje foar immen oars.
Think about what you're doing here.	Tink oer wat jo hjir dogge.
No one had ever thought this would happen.	Nimmen hie oait tocht dat dit barre soe.
It comes from her whole being.	It komt út har hiele wêzen.
And we know you do not have that.	En wy witte dat jo dat net hawwe.
Come on, he said to himself.	Kom op, sei er tsjin himsels.
I wondered how he did it.	Ik frege my ôf hoe't er it die.
My work is done now.	Myn wurk is no dien.
And of course it was.	En fansels wie it.
And there it is to this day.	En dêr is it oant hjoed de dei.
You hold it back.	Jo hâlde it tsjin.
And he still can not be good.	En hy kin noch altyd net goed wêze.
And now it is not even talking.	En no is it net iens praten.
He's with an old man in his office.	Hy is mei in âld man yn syn kantoar.
I'm going to do that now.	Ik gean dat no dwaan.
Of course he already knew that.	Dat wist er fansels al.
You've seen it.	Jo hawwe it sjoen.
I could not find my car.	Ik koe myn auto net fine.
There was some money.	Der wie wat jild.
He was sure it would not.	Hy wie wis dat it net soe.
You can not talk your way out of this.	Jo kinne net prate jo wei út dit.
I want to play again.	Ik wol wer spylje.
What was, is better.	Wat wie, is better.
Do what he did.	Doch it hy die.
But there must be something.	Mar der moat wat wêze.
He can not worry about it.	Hy kin der gjin soargen oer hawwe.
Things are different, now.	Dingen binne oars, no.
It should be out in about a month.	It moat oer in moanne út wêze.
That's what we love.	Dat is wat wy hâlde.
It must be said.	It moat sein wurde.
The children were in the house.	De bern wiene yn it hûs.
It seems like only one way.	It liket mar ien manier.
I do not want anyone to know.	Ik wol net dat ien it wit.
Better late than never.	Better let as nea.
Nothing matters anymore.	Neat makket mear út.
The kids said he liked me.	De bern seine dat hy my leuk hie.
It's really clear.	It is echt dúdlik.
I could have done it differently.	Ik koe it oars.
There was not much to tell.	Der wie net sa folle te fertellen.
Keep back well round.	Hâld werom goed rûn.
He was sitting in my car.	Hy siet yn myn auto.
That could tell us something.	Dat koe ús wat fertelle.
It has done us good.	It hat ús goed dien.
It does not matter what she wants.	It makket neat út wat se wol.
And so it was and that is the truth.	En sa wie it en dat is de wierheid.
Another question.	In oare fraach.
Never assume that you know everything or even enough.	Nim noait oan dat jo alles witte of sels genôch.
She wants me to come and talk to him.	Se wol dat ik mei him kom en praat.
They should have let me go then.	Se hiene my dan gean litte moatten.
We tried to let you know.	Wy hawwe besocht jo witte.
That's for sure now.	Dat is no wis.
I know nothing can happen to you.	Ik wit dat der neat mei dy barre kin.
That would have been a good one.	Dat soe in goede ien west hawwe.
For the first time ever, he scared her.	Foar it earst ea makke er har bang.
I'm trying to do this now.	Ik besykje dit no te dwaan.
John sees this.	John sjocht dit.
But there is a problem.	Mar d'r is in probleem.
It's the problem.	It is it probleem.
And they probably can not.	En se kinne wierskynlik net.
I looked at my wife.	Ik seach nei myn frou.
But there never seemed to be a chance.	Mar der like noait in kâns te wêzen.
You should be what we have been hoping for from the start.	Jo moatte wêze wat wy fan it earste ôf hope hawwe.
Been away for a week.	Hast in wike fuort west.
Of course we did not do that.	Dat hawwe wy fansels net dien.
She actually liked him better now.	Se mocht him no eins better.
And you have to do it.	En jo moatte it dwaan.
Or maybe there is another reason.	Of miskien is der in oare reden.
I look after them well.	Ik sjoch se goed nei.
None of you.	Gjin fan dy.
But somehow it is more than this.	Mar op ien of oare manier is it mear dan dit.
But somehow they did.	Mar op ien of oare manier diene se.
Or to get what they had not received before.	Of om te krijen wat se earder net krigen hiene.
It's just one word.	It is mar ien wurd.
I wanted to know how it felt.	Ik woe witte hoe't it fielde.
It was a good question.	It wie in goede fraach.
Come on in, kids.	Kom yn, bern.
Your mother is almost ready.	Jo mem is hast klear.
You can even have other people living in your house.	Jo kinne sels oare minsken yn jo hûs wenje.
That is not up to us.	Dat is net oan ús.
A dog ran at the man.	In hûn rûn op de man oan.
I have never told this to anyone.	Ik haw nea ferteld dit oan immen.
Do not talk like that.	Praat net sa.
Has he ever.	Hat hy oait.
We have to work really hard.	Wy moatte echt hurd wurkje.
I will visit you in a few months.	Ik sil jo oer in pear moanne besykje.
And talk to him.	En praat mei him.
Time is not money.	Tiid is gjin jild.
He was good to me.	Hy wie goed foar my.
I really wanted a girl.	Ik woe echt in famke.
Let me know, must be fun !!!.	Lit my witte, moat leuk wêze!!!.
It worked, but not for too long.	It wurke, mar net te lang.
If we do not win, you do not pay.	As wy net winne, betelje jo net.
It is likely that none of them visited.	It is wierskynlik dat gjinien fan har besocht.
I'm so very, very tired of being sick.	Ik bin sa heul, heul wurch fan siik wêze.
I will not take that chance.	Ik sil dy kâns net nimme.
He's been on my mind for a month now.	Hy hat my no al in moanne yn gedachten.
The two are together in the next room.	De twa binne tegearre yn 'e folgjende keamer.
He thought he was doing exactly what was needed.	Hy tocht dat er krekt die wat nedich wie.
You're not one of us.	Do bist net ien fan ús.
They do not know what to do.	Se witte net wat se moatte dwaan.
It's for me.	It is foar my.
You have to have it.	Jo moatte it hawwe.
But you're not here to talk about my family.	Mar do bist hjir net om oer myn famylje te praten.
They, too, stop.	Ek se hâlde op.
Everyone already knows you have to do it.	Elkenien wit al dat jo it dwaan moatte.
It was the best job ever !.	It wie de bêste baan ea!.
Why, why, why.	Wêrom, wêrom, wêrom.
I love her.	Ik hâld fan har.
He looked at her cautiously.	Hy seach har foarsichtich oan.
Are you angry at me?	Binne jo lilk op my?
They know you love them.	Se witte dat jo fan har hâlde.
He wants them gone.	Hy wol se fuort.
Would have done it.	Soe it dien hawwe.
You can tell him it's very true.	Jo kinne him fertelle dat it heul wier is.
This will not be a problem for me.	Dit sil gjin probleem wêze foar my.
He was heard.	Hy waard heard.
He wanted to.	Hy woe wol.
I do.	Ik doch.
We both needed it.	Wy hiene it beide nedich.
Nothing she did seemed to be good.	Neat wat se die like goed te wêzen.
He can not even find his wife anymore.	Hy kin syn frou net iens mear fine.
I am life.	Ik bin it libben.
I was wrong there.	Ik wie dêr ferkeard.
He went in to take the job.	Hy gie yn om de baan oan te nimmen.
This way, please.	Dizze manier, asjebleaft.
That's not what it's for me.	Dat is net wat it is foar my.
It just is not.	It is gewoan net.
I was there too.	Ik wie der ek.
She needed to say more.	Se moast mear sizze.
They just keep at it.	Se hâlde dit gewoan troch.
Money could not have bought it.	Jild koe it net kocht hawwe.
My mother told me that.	Myn mem fertelde my dat.
No one can take that from me.	Nimmen kin dat fan my nimme.
Let me go please.	Lit my asjebleaft gean.
She bought it.	Se kocht it.
With this in mind, we were not sure what to do at school.	Mei dit yn gedachten, wy wiene net wis wat te dwaan oan skoalle.
Let me have it now.	Lit my it no hawwe.
Talking I just came easy.	Praten kaam ek net maklik.
It can help you.	It kin jo helpe.
I heard you found.	Ik hearde dy fûn.
He wanted his wife.	Hy woe syn frou.
You have to go to work.	Jo moatte oan it wurk gean.
She would tell her nothing.	Se soe har neat fertelle.
I was able to get back to work in thirty days.	Ik koe oer tritich dagen wer oan it wurk.
It really is not like anything else.	It is echt net as wat oars.
He does not have to say where he is going.	Hy hoecht net te sizzen wêr't hy hinne moat.
Maybe even in the house.	Miskien sels yn 'e hûs.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Ik hoopje dat it mei elkenien goed giet.
I think it's wrong.	Ik tink dat it ferkeard is.
Go in or out.	Gean yn of gean út.
Please let me know soon.	Lit my asjebleaft gau witte.
I plan to see her tomorrow.	Ik bin fan plan om har moarn te sjen.
I also.	Ik ek.
I think of him as my father.	Ik tink oan him as myn heit.
Time enough.	Tiid genôch.
It has its name for a reason.	It hat syn namme foar in reden.
Was there ever a time when everything was fine?	Wie der oait in tiid dat alles goed wie?
He would not do that.	Dat soe er net dwaan.
That's just too much for people.	Dat is gewoan te folle foar minsken.
They do not want to be around you.	Se wolle net om dy hinne wêze.
Soon she could not even speak.	Al gau koe se sels net prate.
There was something else too.	Der wie ek wat oars.
And to no good.	En oant gjin goed.
The man was just ready.	De man wie krekt klear.
Just do your job.	Krekt dwaan dyn wurk.
She can stay.	Se kin bliuwe.
You only get one chance.	Jo krije mar ien kâns.
Had lived in.	Hie wenne yn.
If you have not already done so, please try again.	As jo ​​​​dat net dien hawwe, besykje se dan asjebleaft.
Next room over or so.	Folgjende keamer oer of sa.
I will work late.	Ik sil wurkje let.
And then my mother.	En dan myn mem.
This was clear.	Dit wie dúdlik.
This book is just some thoughts of someone who does not know.	Dit boek is gewoan wat gedachten fan ien dy't it net wit.
Well, my friend there.	No, myn freon dêr.
I know a lot about them, but certainly not everything.	Ik wit in protte oer har, mar wis net alles.
They were out for three hours together.	Se wiene trije oeren tegearre út.
Now everyone has one.	No hat elkenien ien.
Or more than two.	Of mear as twa.
They were not there.	Se wiene der net.
She would not want you to know that.	Se soe net wolle dat jo dat witte.
You can do this easily here.	Jo kinne dit hjir maklik dwaan.
But can not be sure.	Mar kin net wis wêze.
They have nothing to do with each other.	Se hawwe neat mei elkoar te krijen.
Maybe not back actually.	Miskien net werom eins.
Not in this room, in this house, in this life.	Net yn dizze keamer, yn dit hûs, yn dit libben.
But this did not happen at all.	Mar dit barde hielendal net.
We're going out there again now.	Wy geane der no wer út.
We have life.	Wy hawwe it libben.
It's a name.	It is in namme.
He's too sick to be home now.	Hy is no te siik om thús te wêzen.
That's just the first.	Dy is mar de earste.
I had a family.	Ik hie in famylje.
It seems pretty easy.	It liket frij maklik.
They let us through.	Se litte ús troch.
And through and through.	En troch en troch.
Throughout her life.	Yn har hiele libben.
There was something or someone in there.	Der siet wat of immen yn.
She tried to tell you that.	Dat besocht se dy te fertellen.
Maybe I should make it one day.	Miskien moat ik ien dei meitsje.
I had an idea that could work.	Ik hie in idee dat koe wurkje.
Time, that's the problem.	Tiid, dat is it probleem.
First, there would be an idea of ​​where to go.	Earst soe in idee wêze wêr't te gean.
We like to play there.	Wy spylje dêr graach.
I looked at the girl.	Ik seach it famke oan.
I know how much it does.	Ik wit hoefolle it docht.
Please hold me.	Hâld my asjebleaft.
Work began next year.	It wurk begûn takom jier.
To participate.	Om mei te dwaan.
I have friends.	Ik haw freonen.
I was a guy.	Ik wie in keardel.
Not here either.	Ek hjir net.
How true that is.	Hoe wier dat is.
My friends, he says, are very kind.	Myn freonen, seit er, binne hiel aardich.
We do not, of course.	Wy net, fansels.
As we once did.	As wy eartiids.
She would become a good mother from now on.	Se soe fan no ôf in goede mem wurde.
I think it will not.	Ik tink dat it net sil.
But this was the last thing she cared about.	Mar dit wie it lêste wêr't se har soargen oer makke.
She looked at them.	Se seach har oan.
I did not think you would be away that long.	Ik tocht net dat jo sa lang fuort wêze soene.
I hope the same.	Ik hoopje itselde.
You do not.	Jo net.
Even if you can.	Ek as jo kinne.
You get everything.	Jo krije alles.
But nothing happens.	Mar der bart neat.
For no other reason.	Om gjin oare reden.
A lot has happened.	Der is in protte bard.
Praat mar! 	Praat mar!
When he was through, he was through.	Doe't er troch wie, wie er troch.
And now away, completely away.	En no fuort, hielendal fuort.
So few people know it.	Sa min minsken witte it.
You did them.	Jo hawwe se dien.
With good reason.	Mei goede reden.
It was from you.	It wie fan dy.
I asked what had happened to her.	Ik frege wat der mei har bard wie.
It's so fun.	It is sa leuk.
You have to work it out a bit at a time.	Jo moatte it in bytsje op ien kear wurkje.
They were already here.	Se wiene hjir al.
I could help.	Ik koe helpe.
But they are out there.	Mar se binne der út.
I was just tired.	Ik wie gewoan wurch.
It will not worry me.	It sil my gjin soargen meitsje.
She took her children to school.	Se naam har bern nei skoalle.
Someone has to make it happen.	Immen moat it barre.
And then you come.	En dan komme jo.
We were very into it.	Wy wiene der tige yn.
This is of course true.	Dit is fansels wier.
And this is perhaps why it is so difficult.	En dit is miskien wêrom't it sa dreech is.
Many did not.	In protte hat net.
Life is beautiful.	It libben is moai.
It's too early to tell.	It is te gau om te fertellen.
I could tell he wanted to tell me something else.	Ik koe sizze dat hy my wat oars fertelle woe.
After all that work.	Nei al dat wurk.
It's going well with us.	It komt goed mei ús.
It's clear she's a good girl.	It is dúdlik dat se in goed famke is.
I know you know how to be nice.	Ik wit dat jo witte hoe't jo aardich wêze moatte.
Look into it.	Sjocht der yn.
Why, your home is also a good person.	Wêrom, jo ​​thús binne ek in goed persoan.
It is very well done.	It is hiel goed dien.
You will find nothing on me.	Jo sille neat fine op my.
I felt like a new man.	Ik fielde my as in nije man.
But he found a new way of saying it.	Mar hy fûn in nije manier om it te sizzen.
Both together do not work.	Beide tegearre wurket net.
I could not say for sure.	Ik koe it net wis sizze.
He's so nice.	Hy is sa aardich.
I have never seen so much in one place.	Ik haw noch noait safolle op ien plak sjoen.
I know more about him than you.	Ik wit mear oer him as jo.
She's nice.	Se is aardich.
But he is not like that.	Mar hy is net sa.
None of that is necessary.	Gjin fan dat is nedich.
That dog may not come out.	Dy hûn mei net út.
He wondered if it was true.	Hy frege him ôf oft it wier wie.
I do not think she makes it what we think.	Ik tink net dat se it makket wat wy tinke.
But there is just this to say.	Mar der is krekt dit te sizzen.
Really, really easy.	Echt, echt maklik.
I, maybe more than anyone, knew how much they loved him.	Ik, miskien mear as elkenien, wist hoefolle se fan him hâlde.
We let this happen.	Wy litte dit barre.
But clearly not.	Mar dúdlik net.
I'm really glad we did.	Ik bin echt bliid dat wy it dien hawwe.
We do not want them.	Wy wolle se net.
We can not stay here.	Wy kinne hjir net bliuwe.
More on that in a bit.	Mear oer har yn in bytsje.
I could not properly say anything.	Ik koe net goed sizze wat.
Nothing will ever be the same.	Neat sil oait itselde wêze.
We think he can do it.	Wy tinke dat hy it kin.
Nothing came out.	Der kaam neat út.
A dog has that.	In hûn hat dat.
Maybe he would get better.	Miskien soe er better wurde.
But not anymore, man.	Mar net mear, man.
They were good friends of my parents.	Se wiene goede freonen fan myn âlden.
Maybe you're out of your house.	Miskien bist út dyn hûs.
I do not want to do this anymore.	Ik wol dit net mear dwaan.
There you go.	Dêr komme jo oan.
Did she make him.	Hat se him makke.
I believe.	Ik leau.
No kids for me.	Gjin bern foar my.
She's so tall.	Se is sa lang.
I'm just going out.	Ik gean mar út.
I did not think it was good.	Ik tocht net dat it goed wie.
He did not know her very well.	Hy koe har dêr net sa goed oan.
Much better idea.	Folle better idee.
That here is what you tell them.	Dat hjir is wat jo se fertelle.
I wanted a wife.	Ik woe in frou.
Glad to see you too.	Bliid om te sjen ek.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Jo moatte it sa graach wolle dat der oars neat oan docht.
He asked for money.	Hy frege om jild.
That should be difficult.	Dat moat dreech wurde.
It's just not that good.	It is gewoan net sa goed.
It's good, she said, and nothing more.	It is goed, sei se, en mear neat.
You would if you had been there.	Jo soene as jo der west hiene.
First day at school.	Earste dei op skoalle.
But here is no one.	Mar hjir is gjinien.
Which in a way was true.	Wat op in manier wier wie.
He stayed there only a few months.	Hy bleau dêr mar in pear moanne.
That she had heard.	Dat hie se heard.
Or, if he did, he did nothing about it.	Of, as er it die, hat er der neat oan dien.
Can anyone please help.	Kin immen asjebleaft helpe.
I felt sick.	Ik fielde my siik.
Please keep it away from children.	Hâld it asjebleaft fuort fan bern.
Then he looks away.	Dan sjocht er fuort.
The plan was in place.	It plan wie yn plak.
She could do that.	Dat koe se dwaan.
It should not ask too much.	It soe net te folle freegje moatte.
I will never let that happen.	Ik sil it noait barre litte.
Do not tell me.	Fertel it my net.
He had done no wrong.	Hy hie gjin ferkeard dien.
Maybe there was still hope.	Miskien wie der noch hope.
He's never seen one.	Hy hat noait ien sjoen.
Did you go to the party last week?	Hast ferline wike nei it feest west?
But she did not.	Mar se hoegde net.
Everyone was surprised.	Elkenien hie ferrast.
I did not know what she was talking about and said that.	Ik wist net wêr't se it oer hie en sei dat.
I hope this would say it for me.	Ik hope dat dit it foar my soe sizze.
It was actually beautiful though.	It wie eins wol moai.
I really liked it.	Ik fûn it echt leuk.
I do not know exactly what.	Ik wit net wat krekt.
They are different, that's for sure.	Se binne oars, dat is wis.
He knew about it.	Hy wist der fan.
It was just fun, just really fun.	It wie gewoan leuk, gewoan echt leuk.
You should have asked me.	Do hiest my freegje moatten.
That's my bad.	Dat is myn min.
I like that.	Dat tink ik graach.
The day has come.	De dei is kommen.
So is your book.	Sa is dyn boek.
I found it now.	Ik haw it no fûn.
In, around, below.	Yn, om, ûnder.
I do not know that name.	Ik wit dy namme net.
He told her to get out of his room.	Hy fertelde har om út syn keamer te kommen.
And do not look back.	En sjoch net werom.
I would give her nothing.	Ik soe har neat jaan.
You never know what you will get.	Jo witte noait wat jo sille krije.
He was the man for her.	Hy wie de man foar har.
She lives alone, without family.	Se wennet allinnich, sûnder famylje.
No time to waste.	Gjin tiid om der wat oan te dwaan.
I need your help here.	Ik haw jo help hjir nedich.
They did not do it in the same place.	Se diene it net op itselde plak.
There are more to come.	Der komme mear by.
I still remember when he left.	Ik wit noch doe't er fuort gie.
The work was not busy.	It wurk wie net drok.
Let's see what we think.	Litte wy sjen wat wy tinke.
There are twice as many as yesterday.	Der binne twa kear safolle as juster.
But, you can see that it did not.	Mar, jo kinne sjen dat it net die.
There was nothing of the sort.	Der wie neat fan.
You do not know what you are doing by keeping me here.	Jo witte net wat jo dogge troch my hjir te hâlden.
That may not be entirely true.	Dat kin net hielendal wier wêze.
As if he had heard something.	As hie er wat heard.
This is just to remove the whole problem.	Dit is gewoan om it hiele probleem fuort te nimmen.
I need nothing.	Ik haw neat nedich.
He is not one.	Hy is net ien.
It's about the same thing.	It giet oer itselde.
A lot of people did that.	In protte minsken diene dat.
Now he does not care.	No makket him neat út.
To see her.	Om har te sjen.
To make people happy.	Om minsken bliid te meitsjen.
Maybe it was my problem.	Miskien wie it myn probleem.
Only this time it was not.	Allinnich dizze kear wie it net.
But, we did not.	Mar, wy diene net.
That made them so easy to find.	Dat makke har sa maklik te finen.
This, of course, raised an issue.	Dit joech fansels in probleem op.
I wanted to know even more about the boy.	Ik woe noch mear witte oer de jonge.
I just need some more time.	Ik haw gewoan wat mear tiid nedich.
But it has to be.	Mar it moat wêze.
It looked like that though.	It like der wol op.
They were happy.	Se wiene bliid.
I told him to get off the bus.	Ik sei tsjin him om út 'e bus te kommen.
I'm not planning that.	Dat bin ik net fan plan.
But she was not angry.	Mar se wie net lilk.
I can not even speak.	Ik kin net iens prate.
We have seen it before.	Wy hawwe earder sjoen.
I took it easy.	Ik naam it maklik.
The problem was that she was sick so often.	It probleem wie dat se sa faak siik wie.
There's the door.	Dêr is de doar.
He saw me.	Hy seach my.
We're almost done!	Wy binne hast klear!
This morning has been really easy.	Dizze moarn is echt maklik west.
Afraid of me.	Bang foar my.
I was pretty surprised.	Ik wie aardich ferrast.
They get tired.	Se wurde wurch.
I never thought it would be you.	Ik hie noait tocht dat it dy wêze soe.
We want it for the first of the year.	Wy wolle it foar de earste fan it jier.
I know what you're doing.	Ik wit wat jo dogge.
I do not want to see anyone.	Ik wol gjinien sjen.
This book will be fun back to school.	Dit boek sil werom nei skoalle leuk meitsje.
She had no idea where she was in.	Se hie gjin idee wêr't se yn wie.
Since then, it has never been exactly the same.	Sûnt dy tiid is it noait krekt itselde west.
We ask no one to just take our word for it.	Wy freegje gjinien om gewoan ús wurd foar it te nimmen.
You felt like you were at home.	Jo fielde dat jo thús wiene.
Of course it can not.	Fansels kin it net.
They really do not.	Dat dogge se echt net.
Or, that they may see if there is one.	Of, dat se kinne sjen oft der ien is.
She was actually really, really angry at him.	Se wie eins echt, echt lilk op him.
I do not know this guy.	Ik ken dizze keardel net.
But if there's such a thing, it's it.	Mar as der sa'n ding is, dan is dit it.
It never tried.	It hat nea besocht.
There is probably more.	Der is wierskynlik mear.
So, you did not tell anyone.	Dat, jo hawwe it net oan ien ferteld.
I think it may have never been there.	Ik tink dat it der miskien noait west hat.
You have to try it.	Jo moatte it besykje.
Truth be told, she might have worked for me.	De wierheid wurdt sein, se wurke miskien foar my.
But right after that comes his teacher.	Mar fuort nei dy komt syn learaar.
The first was the first to speak.	De earste wie de earste dy't praat.
It's really not that hard to do.	It is echt net sa dreech om te dwaan.
You talked to him.	Jo hawwe mei him praat.
He's just himself.	Hy is gewoan himsels.
Which is the.	Hokker is de.
This was him.	Dit wie hy.
This is not that.	Dit is dat net.
There was something else going on here.	Der wie hjir noch wat oan de hân.
Help her father.	Help har heit.
Everything has been fine.	Alles is goed west.
You have to do the same thing over and over again.	Jo moatte itselde ding wer en wer dwaan.
That's a good girl.	Dat is in goed famke.
He was just happy.	Hy wie mar bliid.
But his money was gone.	Mar syn jild wie fuort.
Bye bye.	Oant sjen.
That started it right there.	Dat begûn it krekt dêr.
I'm been in it for a long time.	Ik bin der lang yn.
I will never see it again.	Ik sil noait mear sjen.
It's not something you can buy.	It is net wat jo kinne keapje.
See where they are now in their lives.	Sjoch wêr't se no binne yn har libben.
This was not who she was.	Dit wie net wa't se wie.
Do not tell other people again.	Fertel oare minsken net wer.
I have nothing to give.	Ik haw neat te jaan.
This was just that.	Dit wie krekt dat.
There, everyone agreed.	Dêr wie elkenien it oer iens.
So we go home and ask him.	Dat wy geane nei hûs en freegje him.
And neither do I.	En ek net.
Maybe a little earlier.	Miskien wat earder.
She is for him.	Se is foar him.
I could do this.	Ik koe dit dwaan.
No one is.	Gjinien is.
Do not tell anyone else, right?	Fertel it net oan immen oars, goed?
But we do not stop.	Mar wy hâlde net op.
I think everyone is just nice.	Ik tink dat elkenien gewoan aardich is.
I'm too old.	Ik bin te âld.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Fertel my asjebleaft dat se dat noait mei bern dogge.
Does not matter.	Makket neat út.
That's not very good.	Dat is net hiel goed.
I've never seen them do that to anyone.	Ik haw se dat noch noait mei immen dwaan sjoen.
Let's go there.	Litte wy der hinne gean.
I'll tell you what you want to know.	Ik sil jo fertelle wat jo witte wolle.
Without him, it would have done me twice as much.	Sûnder him soe it my twa kear sa dien hawwe.
It will not hurt a little.	It sil net in bytsje sear.
I'm the one to ask.	Ik bin dejinge dy't freegje moat.
Still, she said nothing.	Noch altyd sei se neat.
Everything was in place.	Alles wie op syn plak.
It's getting late.	It wurdt let.
Do we even talk to you?	Prate wy sels mei dy?
Or better yet.	Of better noch.
He returned to work yesterday.	Hy kaam juster werom oan it wurk.
No one came up.	Der kaam net ien op.
No one ever knew for sure.	Nimmen wist ea wis wis.
This is for me.	Dizze is foar my.
I'm not too worried.	Ik bin net al te soargen.
That would have been nice.	Dat hie moai west.
Do not touch it.	Rekke der net op.
Many people are not.	In protte minsken binne net.
Maybe she had too.	Miskien hie se ek.
It's just getting old.	It wurdt gewoan âld.
She ran out of food.	Se rûn út iten.
And now he has.	En no hat er.
Let's wait and see.	Lit ús wachtsje en sjen.
He came home, and we never talked about it.	Hy kaam thús, en wy hawwe der noait oer praat.
You can do it now.	Jo kinne kinne it no dwaan.
The first day was good.	De earste dei wie goed.
It would not be easy.	It soe net maklik wurde.
And he will be gone soon.	En hy sil gau fuort.
If they had one.	As se ien hiene.
No problems so far.	Gjin problemen oant no ta.
We've been together all this time.	Wy hawwe dizze hiele tiid tegearre west.
He left it to you.	Hy liet it oan dy.
You know there is no other way.	Jo witte dat d'r gjin oare manier is.
And let me tell you something.	En lit my dy mar wat fertelle.
She had her life ahead of her.	Se hie har libben foar har.
A real home from home.	In echt thús fan hûs.
They would see people they could.	Se soene minsken sjen dy't se koene.
This is from the kids.	Dit is fan 'e bern.
It knew its way the first time already.	It wist syn wei de earste kear al.
And it made him too late for his next class.	En it makke him te let foar syn folgjende klasse.
Well, not exactly.	No, net krekt.
He was still in her life.	Hy wie noch yn har libben.
You are more than that.	Do bist mear as dat.
He does not like you.	Hy hâldt net fan dy.
I just believe in myself.	Ik leau gewoan yn my.
Look at that.	Sjoch nei sa.
Life here is not as difficult as it seems.	It libben hjir is net sa dreech as it liket.
She came to see me when she could.	Se kaam om my te sjen doe't se koe.
She was like that.	Se wie sa.
And none of it would be nice.	En neat fan it soe moai wêze.
Why was he so angry?	Wêrom wie er sa lilk?
And made it happen.	En makke it barre.
It's always me that's wrong.	It is altyd ik dat it ferkeard sit.
Never been.	Noait west.
She might have said or done something.	Se soe miskien wat sein of dien hawwe.
She told me all about it.	Se fertelde my der alles oer.
That's my job.	Dat is myn wurk.
They do not think.	Se tinke net.
Not a good read.	Net in goed lêzen.
She knew this.	Dit wist se.
They were nice.	Se wiene aardich.
No one in the family did.	Gjinien yn 'e famylje die.
If it hurts you, be happy about it.	As it jo sear docht, wês der bliid fan.
How nice is that.	Hoe leuk is dat.
Give everything you need.	Jou alles dat nedich is.
It kind of scares me a little bit about what's coming.	It makket my wol in bytsje bang foar wat der no komt.
But enough of that.	Mar dêr genôch fan.
Tonight, he thought, would be last night.	Jûn, tocht er, soe jûn de lêste wêze.
Now we get it.	No krije wy it.
But this is not really a book.	Mar dit is net echt in boek.
But there was one, well.	Mar der wie ien, goed.
Not so sure.	Net sa wis.
Everything that was there.	Alles wat der wie.
You can not do it that way.	Jo kinne it net sa dwaan.
I see no other way.	Ik sjoch gjin oare manier.
It does not matter to us what happens here.	It makket ús neat út wat hjir bart.
All kids love you.	Alle bern hâlde fan dy.
They never have been and probably never will be.	Se hawwe noait west en sille wierskynlik net wêze.
More than you think you know.	Mear as jo tinke dat jo witte.
That will never happen again.	Dat sil nea wer barre.
You know what we do.	Jo witte wat wy dogge.
I hope my saying it does not hurt you.	Ik hoopje dat myn sizzen dat it jo net sear docht.
And somehow it's there again.	En op ien of oare manier is it der wer.
Not much to see.	Net folle te sjen.
Be careful not to overdo it.	Wês foarsichtich om net te min te meitsjen.
Can anyone help me ?.	Kin immen my helpe?.
There are very few now.	D'r binne no heul min.
It's what we need to do.	It is wat wy moatte dwaan.
I need to know what's going on here.	Ik moat witte wat hjir bart.
You go to bed.	Jo geane op bêd.
I was that guy.	Ik wie dy keardel.
I think there's a reason for that.	Ik tink dat der in reden foar is.
I wanted.	Ik woe.
More kids than ever.	Mear bern as ea.
He can have it.	Hy kin it hawwe.
That happened.	Dat bart eins.
He had a job to do and he did it.	Hy hie in baan te dwaan en hy die it.
Maybe you can get more out of him.	Miskien kinne jo mear út him krije.
I can not love them from you.	Ik kin se net fan dy hâlde.
You must come back with us.	Jo moatte mei ús werom komme.
That's one of the things.	Dat is ien fan de dingen.
He has always been good to you.	Hy hat altyd goed foar dy west.
She's gone from you.	Se is fan dy ôf gien.
Not so much about.	Net safolle oer.
In more ways than one.	Op mear as ien manier.
They're leaving.	Se geane fuort.
That, that he wanted to do.	Dat, dat woe er dwaan.
Show and tell.	Lit sjen en fertelle.
And through him.	En troch him hinne.
I could not help him.	Ik koe him net helpe.
We're glad we found you!	Wy binne bliid dat wy dy fûn hawwe!
Why can't they do something about it?	Wêrom kinne se dêr net wat oan dwaan?
No one knew where she was going or why.	Nimmen wist wêr't se gie of wêrom.
Not a bit.	Net in bytsje.
My father or I.	Myn heit of ik.
He felt too tired to get out of the car.	Hy fielde him te wurch om út de auto te kommen.
I really do not want to do anything other than this.	Ik wol echt neat oars dwaan as dit.
If you have a problem, we have a problem.	As jo ​​​​in probleem hawwe, hawwe wy in probleem.
Hope it will help.	Hoopje dat it sil helpe.
It's the only thing that can be done now.	It is it iennichste dat no te dwaan is.
We have to get there.	Wy moatte der hinne.
We knew it was there.	Wy wisten dat it der wie.
My children.	Myn bern.
It's very beautiful.	It is hiel moai.
Someone please give me a hand.	Immen jou my asjebleaft in hân.
Been there and did that.	Dêr west en dat dien.
Even though they did not look like him, he knew what they were.	Ek al like se der net op, hy wist wat se wiene.
It will take us some time to do this.	It sil ús wat tiid nimme om dit te dwaan.
Well, we can.	No, wy kinne.
I do not know what they were.	Ik wit net wat se wiene.
I will get there myself.	Ik sil der sels komme.
Everyone would be happy.	Elkenien soe bliid wêze.
He becomes a man.	Hy wurdt man.
I could not take it anymore.	Ik koe it net mear oan.
You can not be everything to everyone.	Jo kinne net alles wêze foar elkenien.
I was never told how it would even work ,.	Ik waard nea ferteld hoe't it soe sels wurkje,.
They are far too nice, 'she said.	Se binne folle te aardich,' sei se.
He knew who she was and why she came.	Hy wist wa't se wie en wêrom't se kaam.
No one told him to do this.	Nimmen fertelde him dit te dwaan.
But if it was true.	Mar as it wier wie.
They will be better.	Se sille better wêze.
They do not want to know better.	Se wolle net better witte.
I leave it to him.	Ik lit it oan him oer.
He would like it.	Hy soe dit leuk fine.
Not if she would find anything.	Net as se wat fine soe.
I'll show you life.	Ik sil dy it libben sjen litte.
And that's not it.	En dat is it net.
Everyone just knows that.	Elkenien wit dat gewoan.
Or, you know.	Of, jo witte.
She now knows what will happen, and knows she wants it.	Se wit no wat der barre sil, en wit dat se it wol.
I'm going out there now.	Ik gean der no út.
It had worked once.	It hie ien kear wurke.
I do not have to agree with that.	Dêr moat ik it net mei iens wêze.
They also don’t have to be big problems.	Se hoege ek gjin grutte problemen te wêzen.
Otherwise we do nothing.	Oars dogge wy neat.
There is no need to talk about it now.	Der hoecht no net oer te praten.
You can take your time.	Jo kinne jo tiid nimme.
Maybe they were out.	Miskien wiene se út.
I think it will go well.	Ik tink dat it wol goed gean sil.
Let them show me.	Lit se my sjen.
There is just nothing like it.	Der is gewoan neat as it.
About one of these.	Oer ien fan dit.
That's good enough.	Dat is genôch goed.
They can not do that now.	Dat kinne se no net dwaan.
He lets us do what we have to do.	Hy lit ús dwaan wat wy moatte.
Time for new.	Tiid foar nije.
He does not know about it yet.	Hy wit der noch net fan.
You have to be careful.	Jo moatte foarsichtich wêze.
It's nothing to worry about.	It is neat om soargen oer.
Here's what you need to know.	Hjir is wat jo witte moatte.
Let him talk to me.	Lit him mar mei my prate.
They have been waiting for this man.	Se hawwe op dizze man wachte.
I know what will happen.	Ik wit wat der barre sil.
Now you talk.	No prate jo.
And so they did.	En dat diene se.
Not just mine.	Net allinnich myn.
Mine is even more so.	Myn is noch mear sa.
He's not a little scared of me.	Hy is net in bytsje bang foar my.
The same can be true for you.	Itselde kin wier wêze foar jo.
She knew she was not.	Se wist dat se net wie.
Which it did, of course.	Wat it die, fansels.
You are not going in, now.	Jo geane net yn, no.
I have not read or heard of problems with them.	Ik haw net lêzen of heard fan problemen mei har.
There are two things we need to take care of.	D'r binne twa dingen dy't wy moatte soargje.
If they have nothing, show it.	As se neat hawwe, lit it sjen.
And let me know about it.	En lit my der oer witte.
She had never seen anyone so beautiful in her life.	Se hie noch noait ien sa moai yn har libben sjoen.
All right, man.	Goed, man.
He did not ask for this.	Hy frege hjir net om.
Think carefully about it.	Tink der goed oer nei.
Good.	Goed.
That girl is me.	Dat famke bin ik.
Take the book with you.	Nim it boek mei.
You do not want them to find you.	Jo wolle net dat se jo fine.
You will be one of them.	Jo sille ien fan har wêze.
It's too hard that way.	It is te dreech op dy manier.
But that was not enough for her.	Mar dat wie har net genôch.
Quite obviously not the same.	Hiel fansels net itselde.
I never talked about his mom and dad, nothing about it.	Ik haw it noait oer syn mem en heit praat, dêr neat oer.
There he was too sure of her.	Dêr wie er te wis fan fan har.
I heard him say that in my mind.	Ik hearde him dat yn myn gedachten sizzen.
This is the only thing that has worked for me so far.	Dit is it iennichste ding dat oant no ta foar my wurket.
My dad was ready to go to work.	Myn heit wie klear om oan it wurk te gean.
My mother made the food ready for us.	Myn mem makke it iten foar ús klear.
There would be no place.	Der soe gjin plak wêze.
This kind of thing never happens to me.	Dit soarte fan dingen bart noait mei my.
It could not.	It koe net.
None of them were there now.	Dêr wiene no gjinien fan.
Just a little.	Mar in bytsje.
I have no problem with that.	Dêr haw ik gjin probleem mei.
They are already waiting for you.	Se wachtsje der al op dy.
And now they know there is none.	En no witte se dat der net is.
And he would too.	En hy soe ek.
He had been waiting for this.	Hy hie hjir op wachte.
As in two.	As yn twa.
Well, actually, it's his job.	No, eins is it syn wurk.
You can not get them.	Jo kinne se net krije.
No one has heard of me.	Nimmen hat fan my heard.
It happened again.	It is wer bard.
How can this be?	Hoe kin dit?
Now let's see.	No litte wy sjen.
It's out.	It is út.
We need to know who did it.	Wy moatte witte wa't it dien hat.
Children do not know everything.	Bern witte net alles.
Sure, someone would see.	Wis, immen soe sjen.
We know this is difficult.	Wy witte dat dit dreech is.
Doing one thing or another, but not both, is not enough.	It ien of it oare dwaan, mar net beide, is net genôch.
We were tired enough to easily agree.	Wy wiene wurch genôch om maklik iens te wurden.
I know it's hard to take in.	Ik wit dat it dreech is om yn te nimmen.
He was.	Hy wie.
It could be anyone.	It koe elkenien wêze.
It was you.	It wie dy.
I bought this book yesterday.	Ik kocht dit boek juster.
There is no telling.	Der is gjin fertellen.
We all have a past.	Wy hawwe allegear in ferline.
All by me.	Alles troch my.
Wait, that was it.	Wachtsje, wie dat.
I told him about what had happened to me.	Ik fertelde him oer wat der mei my bard wie.
Maybe more than that.	Miskien mear as dat.
They have never before.	Se hawwe nea earder.
But it did not start.	Mar it begûn net.
And are just three words.	En binne krekt trije wurden.
His name was.	Syn namme wie.
That would be so nice.	Dat soe sa leuk wêze.
This must stop, she told him.	Dit moat ophâlde, sei se tsjin him.
So you have to tell it.	Sa moatte jo it fertelle.
When you are ready you will see the whole thing.	As jo ​​klear binne jo it hiele ding sjen.
His parents are long gone.	Syn âlden binne al lang fuort.
It was not our idea.	It wie net ús idee.
It felt wrong.	It fielde ferkeard.
But he should have left it there.	Mar hy hie it dêr litte moatten.
He was there when he died.	Hy wie der doe't er stoar.
We would win nothing.	Wy soene neat winne.
They probably will not do it.	Se sille it wierskynlik net dwaan.
I told you to come.	Ik sei dy komme.
Or worry about what our friends or family will think.	Of meitsje jo soargen wat ús freonen of famylje sille tinke.
But it does not have to be that way.	Mar it hoecht net sa te wêzen.
Words, words, words.	Wurden, wurden, wurden.
His plan did not come through.	Syn plan kaam net troch.
I'm sure.	Ik bin der wis fan.
They love her too.	Se hâlde fan har ek.
I told you so before.	Ik hie it dy earder sein.
If it's true, that's a lot of money.	As it wier is, is dat in protte jild.
But that's not really the problem here.	Mar dat is hjir net echt it probleem.
It just so happens that today is such a day.	It bart krekt dat hjoed sa'n dei is.
Tell me where I needed to go.	Fertel my wêr't ik hinne moast.
I can see that happening.	Ik kin sjen dat barre.
I wonder what his name would be.	Ik freegje my ôf wat syn namme soe wêze.
I had thought we would grow old together.	Ik hie tocht dat wy tegearre âld wurde soene.
There was nothing that could be done.	Der wie neat datst dwaan koe.
But that was not the only time it happened.	Mar dat wie net de ienige kear dat it barde.
He just got it.	Hy krige it krekt.
He could not think of that now.	Dêr koe er no net oan tinke.
They are not there.	Se binne der net.
It's a very common thing to do.	It is in hiel gewoan ding om te dwaan.
But he has given it another name.	Mar hy hat in oare namme jûn.
That would also be wrong.	Dat soe ek ferkeard wêze.
But we have not seen this.	Mar wy hawwe dit net sjoen.
And it was too late.	En it wie te let.
I'm trying to figure it out.	Ik besykje út te finen.
Again he looked at her.	Wer seach er har oan.
He did not feel scared, exactly.	Hy fielde net bang, krekt.
See look here.	Sjoch sjoch hjir.
Not even out of the house.	Net iens it hûs út.
It was too much to take in.	It wie te folle om yn te nimmen.
Looking forward to you.	Sjoch út nei dy.
Then go in there.	Gean der dan yn.
She looked at her husband.	Se seach har man oan.
That's just how I feel.	Dat fiel ik gewoan.
I just do not see that.	Dat sjoch ik gewoan net.
Hair was on.	Hier wie oan.
There was nothing to do but wait.	Der wie neat te dwaan as wachtsje.
But now that was gone too.	Mar no wie dat ek fuort.
Come with me to his office now.	Kom no mei my nei syn kantoar.
But this time.	Mar dizze kear.
And we do not want it.	En wy wolle it net.
I totally agree with what you said.	Ik bin it hielendal iens mei wat jo sein hawwe.
And well, he shouldn’t.	En goed, hy moat net.
I did that.	Dat haw ik dien.
Who knows how many people.	Wa wit hoefolle minsken.
It's really long.	It is echt lang.
I know nothing about it.	Ik wit der neat fan.
He walked over to her.	Hy rûn nei har ta.
Just to see.	Krekt om te sjen.
I could help if you need.	Ik koe helpe as jo nedich hawwe.
Maybe that was why he did not feel he could tell it to anyone.	Miskien wie dat wêrom hy net fielde dat hy it ien fertelle koe.
Could he do it? 	Koe er it dwaan?
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
She said she had never been so good in one place.	Se sei dat se noch noait sa goed op ien plak west hie.
It happens every day.	It barre alle dagen.
Look after your home and your family.	Sjoch nei jo hûs en jo famylje.
But it is not necessary.	Mar it is net nedich.
Of course you've heard of it.	Fansels ha jo der fan heard.
But there was no place.	Mar der wie gjin plak.
You should have known me.	Do hiest my witte moatten.
Wait, stop,.	Wachtsje, hâld op,.
We can not keep them long.	Wy kinne se net lang hâlde.
If he is.	As hy is.
He is a man of his word.	Hy is in man fan syn wurd.
It will be all.	It sil allegear wêze.
Just like each other.	Krekt as elkoar.
Nothing like good.	Neat like goed.
No one will do that for you.	Nimmen sil dat foar jo dwaan.
I did not expect him not to.	Ik hie net ferwachte dat hy dat net soe.
It's a problem, a real problem.	It is in probleem, in echt probleem.
I was not afraid of him.	Ik wie net bang foar him.
Maybe say something.	Miskien wat sizze.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Oant no ta koe dat net.
That was wrong.	Dat wie ferkeard.
They had done their good work.	Se hiene har goed wurk dien.
John is good in his new life.	John is goed yn syn nije libben.
No one was ready.	Nimmen wie klear.
On the way to dinner.	Op wei nei iten.
It did not wait long.	It wachte net lang.
And it was late in the year.	En it waard let yn it jier.
It makes those things really easy.	It docht dy dingen echt maklik.
In a word, nothing.	Yn in wurd, neat.
He was found on the spot.	Hy waard op it plak fûn.
Had to leave.	Moast fuort.
I do not know.	Dat wit ik net.
It's very different.	It is hiel oars.
Maybe you can make this clear to me.	Miskien kinne jo dit foar my dúdlik meitsje.
Of course it would be good.	Fansels soe it goed wêze.
School of.	Skoalle fan.
I have no idea where we live now.	Ik ha gjin idee wêr't wy no wenje.
You can buy everything there.	Jo kinne dêr alles keapje.
I do not know, of course.	Ik wit it net, fansels.
She was just.	Se wie gewoan.
I took a few days off.	Ik naam in pear dagen frij.
That looks nice.	Dat sjocht der aardich út.
There was no way he could eat now.	Der wie gjin manier dat er no ite koe.
It's better we do not.	It is better dat wy it net dogge.
That was never his job.	Dat wie nea syn wurk.
She does not need me.	Se hat my net nedich.
It does not get better.	It wurdt net better.
They are late for school.	Se binne te let op skoalle.
I thought of you.	Ik haw oan dy tocht.
So glad we are friends.	Sa bliid dat wy freonen binne.
It would have been better to come soon.	It hie wol better gau komme.
There are a lot of good things that way.	Der binne in protte goede dingen op dy manier.
It's not my place to tell him.	It is net myn plak om him te fertellen.
Love these people.	Hâld nei dizze minsken.
No one there.	Gjinien dêr.
Good or bad.	Goed of min.
I hope it works well.	Ik hoopje dat it goed wurket.
He was ready for anything.	Hy wie klear foar alles.
Dad looked at her.	Heit seach har oan.
One of those people is me.	Ien fan dy immen is ik.
You do things together.	Jo dogge dingen tegearre.
The boy looks alone.	De jonge sjocht allinnich.
I will make one thing clear.	Ik sil ien ding dúdlik meitsje.
Who looks back at me?	Wa sjocht dit werom nei my?
But, we'll see.	Mar, wy sille sjen.
It will take him more time.	It sil him mear tiid nimme.
Ask him out well if he is no longer absorbed in the connection.	Freegje him om mei my te kommen, as jo wolle.
So was he.	Sa wie er.
This would be good for them.	Dit soe goed wêze foar har.
You get the idea.	Jo krije it idee.
She tells me nothing.	Se fertelle my neat.
Having him in bed with her was no longer enough.	Om him by har op bêd te hawwen wie net mear genôch.
There is no way through.	Der is gjin wei troch.
Give it as much time as needed.	Jou it safolle tiid as nedich.
I was not sure of anything.	Ik wie der net wis fan wat.
I had seen it.	Ik hie it sjoen.
We stay here whether we like it or not.	Wy bliuwe hjir, oft wy it wolle of net.
And there is not much time.	En der is net folle tiid.
There is not much more to say about it.	Der is net folle mear oer te sizzen.
It made her another woman.	It makke har in oare frou.
They do not work out.	Se wurkje net út.
Other people leave.	Oare minsken geane fuort.
I did not want to ask earlier.	Ik woe net earder freegje.
This was not a school.	Dit wie gjin skoalle.
This much and no more.	Dit folle en net mear.
Well, it did.	No, it die dat.
He likes to do that.	Dat docht er graach.
I told him and he asked my name.	Ik fertelde him en hy frege myn namme.
That was the best.	Dat wie it bêste.
And you have no idea.	En do hast gjin idee.
Do not go to the office.	Gean net nei it kantoar.
He had never seen them before.	Hy hie se noch nea earder sjoen.
I made it through.	Ik makke it troch.
I thought you were more than you liked.	Ik tocht dat jo mear wiene as jo like.
This could very well be the way to do it.	Dit kin hiel goed de manier wêze om it te dwaan.
With you, it's too much regret.	Mei dy is it te folle spyt.
Not at work, not at home.	Net op it wurk, net thús.
So long ago.	Sa lang lyn.
I feel bad.	Ik fiel my min.
That's the mother.	Dat is de mem.
Maybe they are careful.	Miskien binne se foarsichtich.
It's a hard job.	It is in dreech wurk.
If not, make it.	As net, makket it it.
We will be glad to see you.	Wy sille bliid wêze om jo te sjen.
There is enough help for everyone.	Der is genôch help foar elkenien.
And we will.	En wy sille.
Quite a bit.	Hiel wat.
I would not do such a thing.	Ik soe sa'n ding net dwaan.
That was now more than a year ago.	Dat wie no mear as in jier lyn.
Now he asked this of her.	No frege er dit fan har.
He needed her.	Hy hie har nedich.
But she never comes.	Mar se komt noait.
I would love to do more of that.	Dêr soe ik graach mear fan dwaan.
And they have been.	En se hawwe west.
It came out bad.	It kaam min út.
See what he has.	Sjoch wat hy hat.
Can't wait to see that.	Kin net wachtsje om dat te sjen.
You're in trouble.	Jo binne yn de problemen.
If you ever.	As jo ​​ea.
You just want to see.	Jo wolle gewoan sjen.
He felt things.	Hy fielde dingen.
What was in it, he wanted it.	Wat der yn siet, hy woe it.
She thought she might be able to do it.	Se tocht dat se it miskien dwaan koe.
Looking forward to seeing you there !.	Sjoch út nei sjoch dy dêr!.
There is no way.	Der is gjin wei.
Maybe it still is.	Miskien is it noch wol.
More is not always better.	Mear is net altyd better.
He's not sure what's real.	Hy is net wis fan wat echt is.
I was just sure he needed my help.	Ik wie gewoan wis dat hy myn help nedich hie.
Not that he ever said much.	Net dat er oait folle sein hat.
Nor any other man.	Ek gjin oare man.
More sure of himself.	Mear wis fan himsels.
No idea of ​​one man.	Gjin idee fan ien man.
I'm late.	Ik kom te let.
Now it works well.	No wurket it goed.
But that's what my teacher told me to do.	Mar dat is wat myn learaar my fertelde te dwaan.
I told no one what was going on.	Ik fertelde nimmen wat der oan de hân wie.
It happened just for us.	It barde krekt foar ús.
He never had.	Hy hie noait.
That she felt alone.	Dat fielde se allinnich.
She said she could no longer work here.	Se sei dat se hjir net mear wurkje koe.
I am so happy to do this work.	Ik bin sa bliid om dit wurk te dwaan.
I wanted to make it now.	Ik woe it no meitsje.
Have a very good reason.	Hawwe in hiel goede reden.
We do not want any problems.	Wy wolle gjin problemen.
Let me know about it.	Lit my der oer witte.
She talks a lot.	Se praat in protte.
It matters what you believe.	It makket út wat jo leauwe.
They make no money.	Se meitsje gjin jild.
I hurt you.	Ik ha dy sear dien.
Sure, we've done this before.	Wis, wy hawwe dit earder dien.
Anyway, here they are.	Hoe dan ek, hjir binne se.
You're very tall, 'he said.	Do bist hiel lang,' sei er.
We'll just show it.	Wy litte it mar sjen litte.
I have to do something about it.	Ik moat der wat mei dwaan.
And she liked that a lot.	En dat mocht se in protte.
Why she did not know, and now it did not matter.	Wêrom wist se net, en no makke it net út.
Well, enough is enough.	No, genôch is genôch.
I'm so tired.	Ik bin sa wurch.
I have done them in one year.	Ik haw se dien yn ien jier.
It's the truth, it's about someone.	It is de wierheid, it giet oer immen.
This may be incorrect.	Dit kin ferkeard wêze.
Just to see you.	Krekt om dy te sjen.
I just do not hold back.	Ik hâld my gewoan net tsjin.
Such a man does not like.	Sa'n man liket net.
Without you, it can not happen.	Sûnder dy kin it net barre.
I'll be gone too.	Ik sil ek fuort.
I'm a girl.	Ik bin in famke.
I needed one to keep.	Ik hie ien nedich om te hâlden.
They should not make you sick.	Se moatte jo net siik meitsje.
It was happening.	It wie bart.
He was the man's dog.	Hy wie de hûn fan de man.
He wanted me away.	Hy woe my fuort.
I do not know where we're going.	Ik wit net wêr't wy hinne geane.
They both want to see it so much.	Se wolle har beide sa graach sjen.
He said nothing.	Hy sei neat.
Could not make it.	Koe it net meitsje.
Maybe he would.	Miskien soe hy.
She said it was his idea.	Se sei dat it syn idee wie.
I heard nothing else.	Ik hearde neat oars.
Which did not happen.	Wat net barde.
They will never tell you that you have done a good job.	Se sille jo noait fertelle dat jo in goed wurk dien hawwe.
You're the boy's father.	Do bist de heit fan de jonge.
A lot, actually.	In protte, eins.
We have heard good things about him.	Wy hawwe goede dingen oer him heard.
Can't stay here.	Kin hjir net bliuwe.
She is always ready to help people.	Se is altyd ree om minsken te helpen.
How long will we stay.	Hoe lang sille wy bliuwe.
Could not find one.	Koe net fine ien.
Something happened, something happened, something happened.	Der barde wat, barde, der barde wat.
I'm not against hope.	Ik bin net tsjin hope.
He's not sure.	Hy is net wis.
That was good and bad.	Dat wie goed en min.
That's us.	Dat binne wy.
Come to my office in about an hour.	Kom oer ien oere nei myn kantoar.
But that was out of the question.	Mar dat wie út 'e fraach.
After the first time, it's easy.	Nei de earste kear is it maklik.
You get one.	Jo krije ien.
This is the same with us.	Dit is itselde mei ús.
Do not be nice.	Wês net aardich.
I know it will.	Ik wit it wol.
One day at a time, life got a little better.	In dei op in tiid waard it libben wat better.
I think he needs someone to look after him.	Ik tink dat er ien nedich hat om nei him te sjen.
This has worked for her.	Dit hat har wurke.
She would do it.	Se soe it dwaan.
But it was good now.	Mar it wie no goed.
It may work but it should not.	It kin wurkje mar it moat net.
This can be a problem.	Dit kin in probleem wêze.
I have no idea what you're talking about.	Ik haw gjin idee wêr't jo it oer hawwe.
Take from this what you want.	Nim fan dit wat jo wolle.
Do the best you can.	Doch it bêste dat jo kinne.
Very good person.	Hiel goede persoan.
And the people could not believe it at that time.	En de minsken koene it yn dy tiid net leauwe.
I'm really sorry, though.	It spyt my echt, mar .
Or not having one.	Of net ien hawwe.
That's how we happened.	Dat is hoe't wy binne bard.
And he had seen her, well.	En hy hie har sjoen, goed.
Being a man has nothing to do with it.	Man wêzen hat der neat mei te krijen.
That's not the problem.	Dat is net it probleem.
That seems good.	Dat liket goed.
Two was better, three better.	Twa wie better, trije better.
He will have to make new friends.	Hy sil nije freonen meitsje moatte.
And he will do that.	En dat sil er dwaan.
We never, ever, say children are bad.	Wy nea, nea, sizze bern binne min.
She was much better at it than she was.	Se wie der folle better yn as har.
So hair comes from what is not hair.	Sa komt hier fan wat gjin hier is.
For one thing, she did not see me.	Foar ien ding seach se my net.
They want to make it there.	Se wolle it dêr meitsje.
We had a bit of it.	Wy hiene der in bytsje fan.
Or the if only.	Of die as net.
Nobody tried to stop him.	Nimmen hat besocht him tsjin te hâlden.
I know exactly what happened.	Ik wit krekt wat der bard is.
It will be good for me.	It sil goed wêze foar my.
That should be easy.	Dat moat maklik wêze.
You did not come.	Do bist net kommen.
It was a door.	It wie in doar.
We do not know where we are now.	Wy witte net wêr't wy no binne.
And that's what you want.	En dat is wat jo wolle.
I have a child.	Ik haw in bern.

He can not tell.	Hy kin it net fertelle.
So shall we.	Sa sille wy.
But that did not happen at all.	Mar sa barde it hielendal net.
She would never know what it was.	Se soe nea witte wat it wie.
I do not want to know things.	Ik wol gjin dingen witte.
And the house.	En it hûs.
Is not really needed.	Is net echt nedich.
Nobody talks to him.	Nimmen praat mei him.
We have to go now.	Wy moatte no fuort.
Through and through.	Troch en troch.
She quickly looked around the room.	Se seach gau om 'e keamer.
Not everyone will like it, and that's fine.	Net elkenien sil dy leuk fine, en dat is goed.
I should never have told her.	Ik hie it har noait fertelle moatten.
But he did start us off.	Mar hy hat ús wol begûn.
There was nothing else we could do or say.	D'r wie neat oars dat wy kinne dwaan of sizze.
If you do not think much about them, then you are not.	As jo ​​​​net folle oer har tinke, dan binne jo net.
No one will help me.	Nimmen sil my helpe.
That's how it should be.	Sa moat it wêze.
She was among you.	Se wie ûnder dy.
That's all of us here.	Dat is alles fan ús hjir.
He is in me.	Hy is yn my.
I could only do that once again last night.	Dat soe ik jûn noch mar ien kear dwaan kinne.
That was enough.	Der wie genôch sein.
We have to go back now.	Wy moatte no werom.
In those days, it didn’t matter a bit.	Yn dy dagen makke it net in bytsje út.
This works very nicely.	Dit wurket hiel moai.
First talk about the animal.	Earst prate oer it bist.
I liked nothing or wanted nothing.	Ik mocht neat of woe neat.

We really have to.	Wy moatte echt.
With a little help from me of course.	Mei in bytsje help fan my fansels.
I have never met any of them.	Ik haw noait ien fan har moete.
No good comes from the bad.	Gjin goed komt út it minne.
It's how we play true.	It is hoe't wy spylje wier.
There have been some good things and bad things.	Der binne wat goede dingen en minne dingen west.
There is really only one word for that.	Dêr is eins mar ien wurd foar.
Do not eat too much.	Net te folle ite.
That's your job now.	Dat is jo wurk no.
I'm surprised to see you, actually.	Ik bin ferrast om dy te sjen, eins.
She was so much more than that.	Se wie safolle mear as dat.
This is how people are.	Dit is hoe't minsken binne.

Would stay again.	Soe bliuwe wer.
He had nothing more to say.	Hy hie neat mear te sizzen.
You come too.	Jo komme ek.

That's a good word.	Dat is in goed wurd.
I did not think so.	Dat tocht ik net.
It's more for us.	It is mear foar ús.
I was not good.	Ik wie net goed.
This is maybe.	Dizze is miskien.
He felt too sick to help.	Hy fielde him te siik om te helpen.
His young wife was alone in the house.	Syn jonge frou wie allinnich yn 'e hûs.
And the dog, if they had one.	En de hûn, as se ien hiene.
That would be enough, probably.	It soe genôch wêze, wierskynlik.
I have to go home.	Ik moat nei hûs ta.
He also goes to school.	Hy giet ek nei skoalle.
I did nothing there.	Ik die dêr neat.
Really, we did.	Echt, wy diene.

So much water, so little space.	Safolle wetter, sa'n bytsje plak.

Also this past year.	Ek dit ferline jier.
Now look at him.	Sjoch no nei him.
You know where you are here.	Jo witte wêr't jo hjir binne.
This could not happen, could not be real.	Dit koe net barre, koe net echt wêze.
She will not.	Se sil net.
You do not have to worry about him.	Jo hoege jo gjin soargen te meitsjen oer him.
That's really nice.	Dat is echt moai.
If we are not too late.	As wy net te let binne.
Not a bit.	Net in bytsje.
I've never seen such a picture before.	Ik haw jo noch noait sa'n foto sjoen.
I've been here a week.	Ik haw hjir in wike west.
I'm not talking against life.	Ik praat net tsjin it libben.

I would like to wait for my dad.	Ik soe wol wachtsje op myn heit.
But he has no time for that now.	Mar dêr hat er no gjin tiid foar.
To find out what's going on.	Om út te finen wat der bart.
And they do not have it.	En se hawwe it net.
Whether you are.	Oft jo binne.

And so you make money.	En sa meitsje jo jild.
No one had done this before.	Nimmen hie dit earder dien.

Did it yourself.	Die it sels.

But we have to be careful.	Mar wy moatte foarsichtich wêze.
Better than anything we have.	Better dan alles wat wy hawwe.
It's just what we need to do.	It is gewoan wat wy moatte dwaan.
A dog is an animal.	In hûn is in bist.
You have to try.	Jo moatte besykje.
I'm sure he'll be with you soon.	Ik bin der wis fan dat er gau by dy sil wêze.

He would go around them.	Hy soe om har hinne gean.

They are not good for my family.	Se binne net goed foar myn famylje.
Just do the same thing.	Doch gewoan itselde ding.
It's not clear if they really know.	It is net dúdlik oft se it echt witte.
I waited, but he never showed up.	Ik wachte op, mar hy liet nea sjen.
There is the reason.	Dêr is de reden.
Everything looked so different now.	Alles seach der no sa oars út.
But maybe he is not.	Mar miskien is er net.
We can never talk about any of this to her.	Wy kinne nea prate oer ien fan dit foar har.
Of course it was.	Fansels wie it.
I always thought about it.	Ik tocht der altyd oer nei.
She looked up at him.	Se seach nei him op.
It went on.	It gie troch.
This is my question.	Dit is myn fraach.
I'll do this.	Ik sil dit dwaan.
Well, like everything.	No, eins alles.
We both know it will not work.	Wy witte beide dat it net sil wurkje.
It did not seem real.	It like net echt.
She did not hear it.	Se hearde it net.
She wants out, and she wants out now.	Se wol út, en se wol út no.
If it is not, it is too late to do anything about it.	As it net is, is it te let om der wat oan te dwaan.
I hope they are.	Ik hoopje dat se binne.
I put it away.	Ik sette it fuort.
It seems really difficult.	It liket echt dreech.
That I had hoped.	Dat hie ik hope.
You will probably have heard it.	Jo sille it wierskynlik heard hawwe.
I have come.	Ik bin kommen.
Well, one last chance.	No, in lêste kâns.
But do not worry.	Mar meitsje jo gjin soargen.
They say not a word.	Se sizze gjin wurd.
Here's how.	Hjir is hoe.
Or he does not.	Of hy net.
Not here, not from her.	Net hjir, net fan har.
And people are.	En minsken binne.
And they do not talk much about it.	En dêr prate se net folle oer.
Everyone is angry at you.	Elkenien is lilk op dy.
I needed him to be there for me.	Ik hie him nedich om der foar my te wêzen.
That could be all that this is.	Dat kin alles wêze dat dit is.
We could not like him to get away.	Wy koene him der net fan hâlde om fuort te kommen.
Two, three times a week.	Twa, trije kear yn 'e wike.
Of course, there are many questions.	Fansels binne der in protte fragen.
Come what may.	Kom wat kin.
I show that it is not.	Ik lit sjen dat it net is.
Not said before rather than done.	Net earder sein as dien.
To drive him away.	Om him fuort te riden.
You just have to believe.	Jo moatte gewoan leauwe.
You will never have time.	Jo sille nea hawwe tiid.
On the water.	Op it wetter.
It's so beautiful to see.	It is sa moai om te sjen.
I am tired.	Ik bin wurch.
Here is a picture of my family.	Hjir is in foto fan myn famylje.
That would be too obvious.	Dat soe te dúdlik wêze.
Well, let's think here.	No, litte wy hjir tinke.
I still had them.	Ik hie se noch.
And you have to help me.	En jo moatte my helpe.
Everything else was fine.	Al it oare wie goed.
Sit down and it will come back.	Sit en it komt werom.
A life together.	In libben tegearre.
It's not really a problem.	It is net echt in probleem.
He wanted water but did not ask.	Hy woe wetter, mar frege net.
What is he talking about?	Wêr hat er it oer.
But someone has to.	Mar immen moat.
He seemed to have a hard time seeing it clearly.	Hy like it dreech te hawwen om it dúdlik te sjen.
Take this with you.	Nim dizze mei dy.
Try that, let us know then.	Besykje dat, lit it ús dan witte.
We will never find it, for one thing.	Wy sille it nea fine, foar ien ding.
I'm glad he's here.	Ik bin bliid dat hy hjir is.
I touched again.	Ik rekke wer oan.
I've found more and more of it.	Ik bin der mear en mear fan fûn.
I just said it doesn 't happen.	Ik sei gewoan dat it net bart.
See exactly what was said in it.	Sjoch krekt wat der yn sein waard.
It's so.	It is sa.
I was very scared of him.	Ik wie tige bang foar him.
They look wrong to me.	Se lykje my ferkeard.
We talk through.	Wy prate troch.
School is ready.	Skoalle is klear.
That's three years ago.	Dat is trije jier lyn.
He does not want to hurt me.	Hy wol my net sear dwaan.
It's never too late to be happy.	It is noait te let om bliid te wêzen.
Show on time.	Op tiid sjen litte.
I know now that none of this is true.	Ik wit no dat neat fan dit wier is.
Do not think they have one.	Tink net dat se ien hawwe.
We're in the water.	Wy binne yn it wetter.
Know that completely.	Wit dat hielendal.
Of course, she can be wrong.	Fansels kin se ferkeard wêze.
I did it myself.	Ik die it sels.
He expected this.	Hy hat dit ferwachte.
But they seem to like it.	Mar se lykje it leuk te hawwen.
We never did that again.	Dat ha wy nea wer dien.
This is just what everyone wants.	Dit is net wat elkenien wol wolle.
He stands and walks to the door.	Hy stiet en giet nei de doar.
I know she's gone too.	Ik wit dat se ek fuort is.
Probably very few.	Wierskynlik hiel pear.
We eat food to stay alive.	Wy ite iten om yn libben te bliuwen.
From the city.	Fan 'e stêd.
I did not think so.	Dat tocht ik net.
In other words, they can help us.	Mei oare wurden, se kinne ús helpe.
What it is.	Wat it is.
But that's easy.	Mar dat is maklik.
But they are gone now.	Mar se binne no fuort.
We do with him.	Wy dogge mei him.
Far too often.	Folle te faak.
He has no hair.	Hy hat gjin hier.
I was just too tired to go out much at first.	Ik wie gewoan te wurch om earst folle út te gean.
I knew where this was going.	Ik wist wêr't dit hinne gie.
To do something about it.	Om der wat oan te dwaan.
I heard them talking.	Ik hearde se praten.
They would need another way.	Se soene in oare manier nedich wêze.
That's what we do.	Dat is wat wy dogge.
It's just the truth.	It is gewoan de wierheid.
I needed him to look after me.	Ik hie him nedich om nei my te sjen.
If you are not one of them, then so be it.	As jo ​​​​net ien fan har binne, dan is it sa.
It's getting better and better.	It wurdt better en better.
She would not be happy about it.	Se soe der net bliid fan wurde.
Neither wanted to leave.	Gjin fan beide woe fuort.
She was not well, and he was worried.	Se wie net goed, en hy wie soargen.
We do not eat that!	Dat ite wy net!
There is nothing.	Der is neat.
They can get scared, they can get sick.	Se kinne bang wurde, se kinne siik wurde.
It should not have gone that way.	It hie net sa gien moatten.
I did not know one person.	Ik koe net ien persoan.
I just did not know.	Ik wist it gewoan net.
This did nothing.	Dit die neat.
Never heard of her, 'he said.	Nea fan har heard,' sei er.
I'm scared of you.	Ik bin bang foar dy.
And he would.	En hy soe.
Not to that.	Net oan dat.
None of this is true.	Gjin fan dit is wier.
I do bad things.	Ik doch minne dingen.
A new name for his new life.	In nije namme foar syn nije libben.
It was what they did.	It wie wat se diene.
Her friend would have to do it.	Har freon soe it dwaan moatte.
And come back again.	En kom wer werom.
He was now ready with everything.	Hy wie no mei alles klear.
This was not my place.	Dit wie net myn plak.
There is a reason for that.	Dêr is in reden foar.
She kept reading.	Se bleau lêzen.
There is a letter that no one has found.	Der is in brief dy't gjinien fûn hat.
The guy was scared, but not for me.	De keardel wie bang, mar net foar my.
I know what the problem is!	Ik wit wat it probleem is!
Not that they want him with them now.	Net dat se him no by har wolle.
You do not need it.	Jo hawwe it net nedich.
It's not really there.	It is der net echt.
Not much, but something.	Net folle, mar wat.
I was too scared to say anything.	Ik wie te bang om wat te sizzen.
They were not good.	Se wiene net goed.
Whoever has something wants more.	Wa't wat hat, wol mear.
I try to keep other people happy with me.	Ik besykje oare minsken bliid mei my te hâlden.
You can do this for me.	Jo kinne dit foar my dwaan.
There were many of us that day.	Der wiene in protte fan ús dy dei.
It came up easily.	It kaam maklik op.
We did things.	Wy hawwe dingen dien.
No one else seems to.	Nimmen oars liket te.
It was no longer money.	It wie net mear jild.
I'm not sure if that's a good idea or not.	Ik bin der net wis fan oft dat in goed idee is of net.
It was not just about her.	It gie net allinnich om har.
There was no way around it.	Der wie gjin manier om it hinne.
But that is not the same thing.	Mar dat is net itselde ding.
We are here.	Wy binne hjir.
He did not like it, and wondered if it was true.	Hy mocht it net, en frege him ôf oft it wier wie.
It is better to arrive early.	It is better om betiid te kommen.
I know that.	Dat wit ik wol.
He can get there and go easily.	Hy kin der maklik komme en gean.
Didn't say much today.	Hat hjoed net folle sein.
Well, we become them.	No, wy wurde se.
Here you can find everything.	Hjir kinne jo alles fine.
I can go another way.	Ik kin op in oare manier gean.
I did not want them in the movie.	Ik woe se net yn 'e film.
I did not know if I should believe her or not.	Ik wist net oft ik har leauwe moast of net.
She never wanted this.	Se hat dit noait woe.
It was just not done.	It wie gewoan net dien.
She had heard it somehow.	Se hie it op ien of oare manier heard.
I thought this way would work.	Ik tocht dat dizze manier soe wurkje.
And just water.	En gewoan wetter.
It comes first about family.	It komt earst oer famylje.
What they are trying to do to you.	Wat se besykje jo te dwaan.
The house is as bad as he is.	It hûs is like min as hy.
And do it.	En doch it.
They do not know.	Se witte it net.
Not one of us knows what to do.	Net ien fan ús wit wat te dwaan.
We want to know what the who did.	Wy wolle witte wat de wa dien hat.
There was so much wrong to be done.	Der moast safolle ferkeard goed makke wurde.
He was obviously very ill.	Hy wie fansels tige siik.
I just can not tell you.	Ik kin it dy gewoan net fertelle.
There's no one left like me who you would know, for sure.	D'r is gjinien oer as ik dy't jo witte soene, foar wis.
He had the same question.	Hy hie deselde fraach.
This is how it should work.	Sa moat it wurkje.
Something's happening.	Der bart wat.
It felt different.	It fielde oars.
I have to get back to work.	Ik moat wer oan it wurk.
And it is not necessary.	En it is net nedich.
More time than we have.	Mear tiid as wat wy hawwe.
How difficult can that be.	Hoe dreech kin dat wêze.
But that was not good enough.	Mar dat wie net goed genôch.
These can happen.	Dizze kinne barre.
They will not do what they say they want to do.	Se sille net dwaan wat se sizze dat se wolle.
No one is hurt.	Gjinien hat sear.
They are out of the water.	Se binne út it wetter.
She did not look back as she walked.	Se seach net werom doe't se rûn.
We do not agree with that.	Wy binne it net iens mei.
It was really good fun actually.	It wie echt goed leuk eins.
She would never see anything of it now.	Se soe der no noait wat fan sjen.
I'll never get there again.	Ik mei der noait wer komme.
He works with his people.	Hy wurket mei syn minsken.
It would probably be good if we did that here.	It soe miskien wol goed wêze as wy dat hjir diene.
I really can not stop.	Ik kin echt net ophâlde.
She just liked people.	Se mocht gewoan minsken.
Only truth sets one free.	Allinnich wierheid makket ien frij.
She was obviously happy.	Se wie fansels bliid.
I felt a little sick.	Ik fielde my in bytsje siik.
There is someone who can help you.	D'r is ien dy't jo helpe kin.
To keep him there.	Om him dêr te hâlden.
I've seen this.	Ik haw dit sjoen.
She was a mother.	Se wie in mem.
We were free.	Wy wiene frij.
That seems like a likely place.	Dat liket in wierskynlik plak.
This we can know.	Dit kinne wy ​​witte.
Tell me if it's not.	Fertel my as it net is.
But so it goes.	Mar sa giet it.
That, please do not talk about him like that anymore.	Dat, asjebleaft net mear sa oer him prate.
She said she was fine.	Se sei dat se goed wie.
Why not go now? 	Wêrom net gean no?
.	.
For the first time in my life.	Foar it earst yn myn libben.
We do not know what the truth is.	Wy witte net wat de wierheid is.
We need to help him.	Wy moatte him helpe.
She arrived a day late.	Se kaam in dei te let.
I hope she knows what she's doing.	Ik hoopje dat se wit wat se docht.
I was very happy about that.	Dêr wie ik tige bliid foar.
He was not eating.	Hy wie net oan it iten.
What is.	Wat is.
Her look makes me so happy.	Har sjen makket my sa bliid.
Since that time not so much.	Sûnt dy tiid net sa folle.
He scared himself.	Hy makke himsels bang.
I do not do it.	Ik doch it net.
Now she had not either.	No hie se ek net.
But it is not so.	Mar sa is it net.
More than your husband does.	Mear as dyn man docht.
Let me say that one more time.	Lit my dat noch ien kear sizze.
I'm talking about it.	Ik praat der oer.
Let it wait a few months and see.	Lit in pear moanne wachtsje en sjen.
I'll see if you can do that.	Ik sil sjen oft jo dat kinne.
I was not reading.	Ik wie net oan it lêzen.
Ask them to come.	Freegje se om te kommen.
He was sure.	Hy wie wis.
You have, of course.	Jo hawwe, fansels.
But no one is real.	Mar nimmen is echt.
A few days.	In pear dagen.
In one room.	Yn ien keamer.
That is not entirely true.	Dat is net hielendal wier.
You are beautiful too.	Do bist ek moai.
I would take his life.	Ik soe syn libben nimme.
Now she was here and she had nothing left.	No wie se hjir en se hie neat mear oer.
You have friends who.	Jo hawwe freonen dy't.
It is still being worked on.	Der wurdt noch oan wurke.
He works for me.	Hy wurket foar my.
I would agree more than that to be true.	Ik soe it mear iens wêze as dat wier wier.
That's what he said to me.	Dat sei er tsjin my.
He was not scared, exactly.	Hy wie net bang, krekt.
But we know we will.	Mar wy witte dat wy sille.
He did not even know it.	Hy wist it sels net.
That is not our job.	Dat is ús wurk net.
You just have to try it.	Jo moatte it gewoan besykje.
Let.	Let.
I liked her.	Ik mocht har graach.
I wanted to see again.	Ik woe wer sjen.
We need to talk.	Wy moatte prate.
I was alone.	Ik wie allinnich.
She opened the door.	Se die de doar iepen.
So he likes to think about himself.	Sa tinkt er graach oer himsels.
And it will work well.	En it sil goed wurkje.
He did not expect that either.	Dat hie er ek net ferwachte.
We were glad to see you.	Wy wiene bliid dy te sjen.
I used to like it.	Ik hie it eartiids leuk.
It was time to talk.	It wie tiid om te praten.
And it makes me happy.	En it makket my bliid.
Everything they had done to them.	Alles wat se har dien hiene.
See you next week !.	Oant sjen nije wike!.
Just give what we have.	Jou gewoan wat wy hawwe.
Just a little more.	Krekt in bytsje mear.
There is also no friend.	Der is ek gjin freon.
As it were.	As it gewoan wie.
He was not a bad guy, really.	Hy wie net in minne keardel, echt.
We need them too.	Wy hawwe har ek nedich.
He pretended not to see her.	Hy die oft er har net seach.
I can still remember the first time we met.	Ik kin my noch dúdlik de earste kear dat wy moete.
Just pick it up and go.	Nim it gewoan op en gean fuort.
They can already be done now.	Se kinne no al dien wurde.
Many have tried.	In protte hawwe besocht.
I know we can do it.	Ik wit dat wy it kinne.
He returned earlier than expected.	Hy kaam earder werom as ferwachte.
This will be the last.	Dit sil de lêste wêze.
Love that man.	Hâld fan dy man.
Of course she had to.	Fansels moast se.
It's not a way to be a boy.	It is gjin manier foar in jonge te wêzen.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Dêr wie neat oan.
I think of him so clearly.	Ik tink him sa dúdlik.
One is not too good.	Ien is net te goed.
I like those other things.	Ik haw dy oare dingen.
But there is not.	Mar der is net.
I think it's coming too late.	Ik tink dat it te let komt.
Everything is going well.	Alles giet goed.
That did it.	Dat die it.
Give or take a year.	Jou of nim in jier.
But, that was it.	Mar, dat wie it.
This should be the year.	Dit moat it jier wurde.
That is a very good question.	Dat is in hiel goede fraach.
You do not have to do anything.	Jo moatte neat meitsje.
He could do it, but he had never tried.	Hy koe it wol, mar hy hie nea besocht.
But maybe that's more my problem than that.	Mar miskien is dat mear myn probleem as dy.
I can not give it to her now.	Ik kin it har no net jaan.
She knew he was doing it.	Se wist dat hy it die.
You've had it long enough.	Jo hawwe it lang genôch hân.
You are the best.	Do bist de bêste.
And the children were gone.	En de bern wiene fuort.
Time for me to go.	Tiid foar my om te gean.
He is there alone.	Hy is dêr allinnich.
You just can not win.	Jo kinne gewoan net winne.
I do not know if we have a morning.	Ik wit net oft wy in moarn hawwe.
I love our house.	Ik hâld fan ús hûs.
They would have a dog.	Se soene in hûn hawwe.
I can not hold it.	Ik kin it net hâlde.
Well, that's just wrong, my friend.	No, dat is gewoan ferkeard, myn freon.
You know what what is.	Jo witte wat wat is.
They have no idea how hard your life really is.	Se hawwe gjin idee hoe hurd dyn libben eins is.
Must be easy.	Moat maklik wêze.
He did not get it.	Hy krige it net.
Three people.	Trije minsken.
There is no time for that.	Dêr is gjin tiid foar.
You may be glad you heard that.	Jo kinne bliid wêze dat jo dat heard hawwe.
This is your first movie.	Dit is dyn earste film.
It keeps me interested.	It hâldt my ynteressearre.
The children are clearly happy.	De bern binne dúdlik bliid.
They were not mine.	Se wiene net fan my.
It seems too much like what they have.	It liket te folle, wat se hawwe.
Is he.	Is hy.
That left only one left.	Dat liet mar ien oer.
And he was the only one.	En hy wie de ienige.
The morning came.	De moarn kaam.
Well, that was good.	No, dat wie goed.
What's his name.	Wat is syn namme.
Not like we are today.	Net sa as wy hjoed binne.
I probably did not want to know.	Ik woe it wierskynlik net witte.
I do not believe he even wanted to do this.	Ik leau net dat er dit iens dwaan woe.
We do not need them.	Wy hawwe se net nedich.
But he is wrong.	Mar hy is ferkeard.
I felt bad for him.	Ik fielde min foar him.
But he did not want to stay in the room forever.	Mar hy woe net foar altyd yn 'e keamer bliuwe.
We are not afraid.	Wy binne net bang.
I have nothing to do with that.	Ik ha der neat oan om dat te dwaan.
The money needed.	It jild nedich.
I really never thought about it.	Ik hie der echt nea oer tocht.
Maybe we are already that.	Miskien binne wy ​​dat al.
Can't believe it's almost here.	Kin net leauwe dat it hjir hast is.
If and when we take a lot, we are good.	As en as wy in protte nimme, binne wy ​​goed.
Please come back here soon.	Kom hjir asjebleaft gau werom.
I felt tired, but in a good way.	Ik fielde my wurch, mar op in goede manier.
But I have one problem.	Mar ik haw ien probleem.
He did not want to get angry.	Hy woe net lilk wurde.
You have to think of something else.	Jo moatte oan wat oars tinke.
I think they are pretty good.	Ik tink dat se aardich goed binne.
It just gets better and better.	It wurdt gewoan better en better.
I started to worry.	Ik begûn te soargen.
They knew nothing of it.	Se wisten der neat fan.
I was fine with him.	Ik hie it goed mei him.
They also do not go through.	Se geane ek net troch.
It is very clear.	It is hiel dúdlik.
We are all good.	Wy binne allegear goed.
That's what you can do.	Dat is wat jo kinne dwaan.
I never do anything with my hair.	Ik doch noait wat mei myn hier.
I knew very well where everyone was.	Ik wist hiel goed wêr't elkenien wie.
I was never here.	Ik wie hjir noait.
She's scared of you.	Se is bang foar dy.
I do not really know how to say it.	Ik wit net echt hoe ik it sizze moat.
You kind of like it.	Jo soarte fan like it.
He does not have to worry.	Hy hoecht gjin soargen te hawwen.
They do not say that and do not agree with it.	Dat sizze se net en binne it der ek net mei iens.
By the time he went back to bed.	Tsjin 'e tiid gie er wer op bêd.
That's really hard for us.	Dat is echt dreech foar ús.
I ask it.	Ik freegje it.
They have said so much.	Se hawwe sein safolle.
I no longer feel that way.	Ik fiel my net mear sa.
But two.	Mar twa.
That he would see and wait for another opportunity.	Dat hy soe sjen en wachtsje op in oare kâns.
Even this and much more.	Sels dizze en folle mear.
I'm not like that.	Ik bin net sa.
They did so this time.	Dat diene se dizze kear.
It is the question of what is good.	It is de fraach wat goed is.
There is no one who can help you.	D'r is gjinien dy't jo helpe kin.
There was no one there.	Dêr wie gjinien.
There were two other people at the scene.	Der wiene twa oare minsken op it plak.
So I do not have enough time now.	Sa haw ik no net genôch tiid.
Maybe it's a lot, or maybe not so much.	Miskien is it in protte, of miskien net sa folle.
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo in protte fragen hawwe.
We know about who we are talking about.	Wy witte oer wa't wy it hawwe.
Never much more to say.	Nea folle mear te sizzen.
But I still need help.	Mar ik haw noch help nedich.
But it was something.	Mar it wie wat.
But none of these things are true.	Mar net ien fan dizze dingen is wier.
I got through it.	Ik ha it troch.
But not with her.	Mar net mei har.
But we must take the opportunity.	Mar wy moatte de kâns nimme.
And you can not even buy them anymore.	En dy kinne jo net iens mear keapje.
I thought it would be really hard, but it was not.	Ik tocht dat it echt dreech wêze soe, mar it wie net.
They are good children.	It binne goede bern.
He knows her.	Hy ken har.
That I'm not anymore.	Dat bin ik net mear.
He says it's time.	Hy seit dat it tiid is.
I was worried about you.	Ik makke my soargen oer dy.
It hurt me to have to do that.	It die my sear dat ik dat dwaan moast.
She will not come to you.	Se sil net by dy komme.
We just weren’t.	Wy wiene gewoan net.
Really very nice.	Echt hiel moai.
Of course it can be.	Fansels kin it wêze.
We can tell you about the food when we return.	Wy kinne jo fertelle oer it iten as wy werom komme.
She could not wait to go back home.	Se koe net wachtsje om werom te gean nei hûs.
You have to go back.	Jo moatte werom.
I think you should have been there.	Ik tink dat jo der west hawwe moatten.
I do not think we can ask for more.	Ik tink net dat wy mear freegje kinne.
Life gets so much better.	It libben wurdt safolle better.
What if this and what if that.	Wat as dit en wat as dat.
It does not matter.	It makket neat út.
It has never happened before.	It is noch noait earder bard.
It may be the same with you.	It kin wêze itselde mei dy.
I'm so happy.	Ik bin sa bliid.
Her parents are very worried but find her soon.	Har âlden binne tige soargen, mar fine har al gau.
He would like to work through it.	Hy soe der wol troch wurkje.
This time it has been so different.	Dizze kear is it sa oars west.
We need to get this done.	Wy moatte dit dien krije.
This was my house.	Dit wie myn hûs.
But he gave up.	Mar hy joech op.
I just did what needed to be done.	Ik haw krekt dien wat dien wurde moast.
I think a lot of people were.	Ik tink dat in protte minsken wiene.
We knew we could do better.	Wy wisten dat wy it better koene.
One year was enough.	Ien jier wie genôch.
We do not need that.	Dat hawwe wy net nedich.
And, we can give life.	En, wy kinne it libben jaan.
No one else will do it for them.	Nimmen oars sil it foar har dwaan.
Are you ready?	Bist klear?
You have to wait and see.	Jo moatte wachtsje en sjen.
See you at thirty.	Oant sjen oer tritich.
But there was no place for him to go.	Mar der wie gjin plak foar him om te gean.
From almost nothing came.	Fan hast neat kaam.
There was, of course, nothing.	Dêr wie fansels neat.
We need to find the truth of this.	Wy moatte de wierheid fan dit fine.
Maybe that would be best.	Miskien soe dat it bêste wêze.
They will tell you that it is your father.	Se sille jo fertelle dat it jo heit is.
She will love this.	Se sil fan dit hâlde.
Give her one last chance.	Jou har in lêste kâns.
We already have more than one.	Wy hawwe al mear as ien.
I see us with many animal friends.	Ik sjoch ús mei in protte bist freonen.
It's a man.	It is in man.
We are so glad we did.	Wy binne sa bliid dat wy it dien hawwe.
And so it is.	En sa is it.
He's a movie, but she's real.	Hy is in film, mar se is echt.
None of this is real.	Gjin fan dit is echt.
More likely from his wife.	Mear wierskynlik fan syn frou.
Lastly, do not be afraid to get involved.	As lêste, wês net bang om mei te dwaan.
He had a few friends.	Hy hie in pear freonen hân.
We think it should.	Wy tinke dat it moat.
But this is the last chance.	Mar dit is de lêste kâns.
I will not need that.	Dat sil ik net nedich hawwe.
You will never know why.	Jo sille nea witte wêrom.
Or what it does with other things, or whatever.	Of wat it mei oare dingen docht, of wat dan ek.
They obviously want to be more, do and have.	Se wolle fansels mear wêze, dwaan en hawwe.
But there is.	Mar der is.
See what you can find.	Sjoch wat jo fine kinne.
It was my only chance.	It wie myn ienige kâns.
She loves her job.	Se hâldt fan har wurk.
Go buy your mom a house.	Gean jo mem in hûs keapje.
I can be there for you.	Ik kin der foar dy wêze.
He did even better than we expected.	Hy hat noch better dien dan wy hiene ferwachte.
He would go with you.	Hy soe mei dy gean.
If you have the time, keep reading.	As jo ​​​​de tiid hawwe, gean dan troch mei lêzen.
He must have run again.	Hy moat wer rûn hawwe.
I know you.	Ik ken dy.
There's a woman.	Dêr is in frou.
So do people.	Sa dogge minsken.
Someone who does that, that's for sure.	Immen die dat, dat is wis.
What would be one.	Wat soe ien wêze.
So far, so good.	Oant no ta, dat wol.
He's worried.	Hy hat soargen.
You you you you you.	Jo jo jo jo.
So hope we can get to show that.	Sa hoopje wy kinne krije dat te sjen litte.
I had not heard of it before.	Ik hie noch net earder heard.
The first month is just that.	De earste moanne is krekt dat.
Nobody wants it, everyone should have it.	Nimmen wol it, elkenien moat it hawwe.
It's at home for you.	It is op it hûs foar jo.
It goes hand in hand.	It giet hân yn hân.
He just said he did not want to.	Hy sei gewoan dat er net woe.
From work.	Fan it wurk.
Let me go! 	Lit my gean!
Does everyone come by car?	Komt elkenien mei de auto?
He probably did.	Hy hat it wierskynlik dien.
And the problem is the following.	En it probleem is it folgjende.
Show that you can get the job done.	Lit sjen dat jo it wurk dien kinne krije.
But you know what happened.	Mar jo witte wat der bard is.
But it does not have to be.	Mar it hoecht net te wêzen.
Not even going to eat.	Net iens om te iten te gean.
I said to her, nothing.	Ik sei tsjin har, neat.
But the words had never come easily to him.	Mar de wurden wiene him nea maklik kommen.
They could not.	Se koene net.
You have to pay your way.	Jo moatte jo manier betelje.
But she knew she could do nothing.	Mar se wist dat se neat dwaan koe.
You are nice.	Do bist aardich.
Just like what we did this morning.	Krekt as wat wy dizze moarn diene.
No problem.	Gjin probleem.
He does it well for himself.	Hy docht it goed foar himsels.
You may be wrong.	Jo binne miskien ferkeard.
But we say it a lot.	Mar wy sizze it in protte.
Clearly, this would not be easy.	Dúdlik soe dit net maklik wurde.
He has to do it, whether he wants to or not.	Hy moat it dwaan, oft er it wol of net.
There was nothing he wanted more.	D'r wie neat dat er mear ha woe.
She saw her mother.	Se seach har mem.
No one could know.	Nimmen koe it witte.
We are good together.	Wy binne goed tegearre.
A great one, and you got it right.	In grutte, en do hast it goed.
You do not know how to do it.	Jo witte net hoe't jo it dwaan moatte.
Hold up! 	Ophâlde!
She said it was both.	Se sei dat it beide wie.
And when you think you're one, you become one.	En as jo tinke dat jo ien binne, wurde jo ien.
So she ran, as hard as she could.	Sa rûn se, sa hurd as se koe.
It's not just him.	It is net allinnich hy.
And I'm fine with that.	En dêr bin ik goed mei.
I do not really like it.	Ik haw it net echt.
This is really too little.	Dit is echt te min.
There would be no coming back.	Der soe gjin werom komme.
But, that has yet to happen.	Mar, dat moat noch barre.
I hope you enjoyed reading it.	Ik hoopje dat jo it leuk hawwe om it te lêzen.
All they have is money.	Alles wat se hawwe is jild.
Of course, he was not into it for the money.	Fansels, hy wie net yn it foar it jild.
And there was his bed.	En dêr wie syn bêd.
I think we need to know more about that.	Ik tink dat wy dêr mear oer witte moatte.
The problem is still there.	It probleem is der noch.
But they had.	Mar se hiene.
She was angry at him.	Se wie lilk op him.
You need to help us to help you.	Jo moatte ús helpe om jo te helpen.
It's her party.	It is har feest.
Why they do it.	Wêrom dogge se it.
She has been there a year.	Se hat dêr in jier west.
Just do what you think is right, do your job.	Doch gewoan wat jo tinke dat goed is, doch jo wurk.
Nor is there any reason why it should have.	Ek is d'r gjin reden wêrom't it moat hawwe.
But that was nice too.	Mar dat wie ek moai.
He can talk, but he does not speak.	Hy kin prate, mar hy praat net.
Probably more of the same.	Wierskynlik mear fan itselde.
He could not stand it.	Hy koe it net oan.
You found it.	Jo hawwe it fûn.
Done for the day.	Dien foar de dei.
I will stop here.	Ik sil hjir ophâlde.
But this is not the time for it.	Mar dit is net de tiid foar it.
But it was clear enough.	Mar it wie dúdlik genôch.
That, of course, could not.	Dat koe fansels net.
Did not tell us to hurt you.	Sei ús net om dy sear te dwaan.
Was not too happy about that.	Wie dêr net te bliid om.
Bye bye!.	Oant sjen!.
I'll find him you.	Ik sil him fine dy.
The meeting was long.	De gearkomste wie lang.
But she had nothing to do with it.	Mar se hie der neat mei te krijen.
The children were happy.	De bern wiene bliid.
Maybe you are ready, maybe not.	Miskien binne jo klear, miskien net.
It works well.	It wurket goed.
Maybe now was the time.	Miskien wie no de tiid.
I do not know if that is such a good idea.	Ik wit net oft dat sa'n goed idee is.
He wanted to play me too.	Hy woe my ek spylje.
He said why not.	Hy sei wêrom net.
My parents live there.	Myn âlden wenje dêr.
I like to win.	Ik graach winne.
And we are.	En wy binne.
She could stay with us.	Se koe by ús bliuwe.
You have to make it.	Jo moatte it meitsje.
People are just not interested in what they have to say.	Minsken binne gewoan net ynteressearre yn wat se te sizzen hat.
She told everyone what had happened.	Se fertelde elkenien wat der bard wie.
This I will.	Dit sil ek.
Whatever it is, do not tell me.	Wat it ek is, fertel my net.
He would have to act like he did not like them.	Hy soe dwaan moatte as hie er se net leuk.
But it does not happen.	Mar it bart net.
It's pretty much the only thing we disagree on.	It is sa'n bytsje it iennichste wêr't wy it net oer iens binne.
As if he wanted it that way.	As woe er it sa.
Now it's up to one.	No is it oan ien.
I do not know what she thinks, what she knows and does not know.	Ik wit net wat se tinkt, wat se wit en net wit.
Then, create a problem.	Dan, meitsje in probleem.
So this seems to be the problem.	Dat dit liket it probleem te wêzen.
But there is more to it than that.	Mar der is mear oan as dat.
It should never be thought of.	Der soe nea oan tocht wurde moatten.
It's very good.	It is hiel goed.
I just ran into something.	Ik rûn krekt wat yn.
It just wasn’t her city.	It wie gewoan net har stêd.
I have enough.	Ik haw genôch.
You probably know the reason.	Jo wierskynlik witte de reden.
I was worried by this.	Ik wie soargen troch dit.
She could not hold it.	Se koe it net hâlde.
Just thought you should know.	Krekt tocht dat jo moatte witte.
Buy one and see for yourself.	Keapje ien en sjoch sels.
I do not know what's going on.	Ik wit net wat der bart.
More of it.	Mear fan it.
No worries for me.	Gjin soargen foar my.
Where should he be.	Wêr moast er wêze.
But he did not leave it at that.	Mar dêr liet hy it net by.
It's the same as last week.	It is itselde as ferline wike.
He said bad things to me.	Hy sei min tsjin my.
There is no getting around it.	Der is gjin komme om it.
He had not given it to him.	Hy hie him net jûn.
I told her we were around thirty.	Ik haw har sein dat wy der om tritich binne.
She never talked about it.	Se hat noait oer har praat.
This is what you do for yourself.	Dit is wat jo foar jo dogge.
She knew she would have to see him soon.	Se wist dat se him gau sjen moatte soe.
I just knew it.	Ik wist it gewoan.
She liked them, and that was reason enough to keep her away.	Se mocht har, en dat wie reden genôch om har fuort te hâlden.
But this posed a problem.	Mar dit joech in probleem.
He can not do that.	Dat kin er net.
She looked at you.	Se seach nei dy.
But my mother would not give it to me.	Mar myn mem soe it my net jaan.
We do not want to go on any of those.	Wy wolle net op ien fan dy gean.
Please try again.	Besykje it asjebleaft.
It just so happens.	It komt gewoan sa foar.
Exactly, he die.	Krekt, hy die.
First nothing.	Earst neat.
Sure, we knew it had to happen.	Wis, wy wisten dat it barre moast.
We'll be there with you soon.	Wy sille mei dy dêr gau by.
And we're good at it.	En wy binne der goed yn.
My house, my family.	Myn hûs, myn famylje.
He just looked at me and pretended not to see me.	Hy seach my mar makke oft er my net seach.
She had just over an hour until she was ready.	Se hie krekt mear as in oere oant se klear wie.
He enters.	Hy giet yn.
Probably it was a bit of both.	Wierskynlik wie it in bytsje fan beide.
We really are like a family.	Wy binne echt as in famylje.
I do not want to be you either.	Ik wol dy ek net wurde.
Then to me.	Dan nei my.
But he was not here.	Mar hy wie hjir net.
He's a friend.	Hy is in freon.
Maybe much more.	Miskien folle mear.
It was so clear he had no idea what to do.	It wie sa dúdlik dat hy gjin idee hie wat te dwaan.
She just could not think of these things.	Se koe gewoan net oan dizze dingen tinke.
Why did you not come yesterday?	Wêrom bist juster net kommen?
But he should not have worried.	Mar hy hie gjin soargen moatten hawwe.
We could not let this happen.	Wy koene dit net barre litte.
He does not know what he is doing.	Hy wit net wat er docht.
Have it on.	Hawwe it oan.
We'm getting through.	Wy komme troch.
Is better.	Is better.
And they are getting old.	En se wurde âld.
Nothing true was ever heard of him.	Der waard ea neat wier fan him heard.
He has the best job in town.	Hy hat de bêste baan yn 'e stêd.
But for you.	Mar foar dy.
And very happy with it.	En der tige bliid mei.
I am sorry.	It spyt my.
Your plan will work.	Jo plan sil wurkje.
He would not let her.	Hy soe har net litte.
They will actually get it done in a good way !.	Se sille it eins op in goede manier dien krije!.
Well, he thought.	No, tocht er.
I love helping people.	Ik hâld fan minsken te helpen.
And this other time.	En dizze oare kear.
But you have to give yourself a chance here.	Mar jo moatte jo hjir in kâns jaan.
She was under day one.	Se wie ûnder de dei ien.
I started you.	Ik haw dy begûn.
The other did not even show it.	De oare liet it net iens sjen.
She could say nothing.	Se koe neat sizze.
But she knows it's early.	Mar se wit dat it betiid is.
He had something to tell me.	Hy hie my wat te fertellen.
I'm very sick.	Ik bin tige siik.
It's not like he can see me.	It is net sa dat er my sjen kin.
I need to get home soon.	Ik moat gau thús komme.
Do you regret what you did?	Hawwe jo spyt fan wat jo dien hawwe?
I'm still getting out of there.	Ik kom der noch út.
I can't believe it.	Ik kin it net leauwe.
That's coming next week.	Dat komt takom wike.
As if everything was beautiful.	As wie alles moai.
When it was us.	Doe't it wie ús.
And it is.	En it is.
She was tall.	Se wie lang.
He does not even know them by name.	Hy ken se net iens by namme.
I should see it.	Ik soe it sjen moatte.
Then go away.	Gean dan fuort.
He is a good dog.	Hy is in goede hûn.
I want to be a friend who is a girl.	Ik wol in freon wêze dy't in famke is.
Now we have other problems.	No hawwe wy oare problemen.
I said it was mine.	Ik sei dat it fan my wie.
I do not know what the children got.	Ik wit net wat de bern krigen hawwe.
They never had a boy.	Se hiene noait gjin jonge.
Maybe you can be happy to see me so and so.	Miskien kinne jo bliid wêze om my sa en troch te sjen.
Had himself out.	Hie himsels út.
See how it works.	Sjoch hoe't it wurket.
You will not be able to leave that.	Jo sille dat net litte kinne.
Woman to woman.	Frou oan frou.
They have never met.	Se hawwe noait moete.
Just for a bit.	Krekt foar in bytsje.
Do not worry about it.	Sit der gjin soargen oer.
I have no money to buy anything.	Ik haw gjin jild om wat te keapjen.
I know what my problem is.	Ik wit wat myn probleem is.
His mother was gone.	Syn mem wie fuort.
It's coming.	It komt oan.
It looks like other people want it.	It sjocht der út hoe't oare minsken it wolle.
And it was so easy to do the thing right.	En it wie sa maklik om it ding goed te dwaan.
For the better, of course.	Foar it better, fansels.
It will also be the last.	It sil ek de lêste wêze.
I'll tell you what happens.	Ik sil dy fertelle wat der bart.
He was right here.	Hy wie hjir krekt.
Everything was the same, but everything was different.	Alles wie itselde, mar alles wie oars.
Please talk to the man.	Graach mei de man prate.
It would work.	It soe wurkje.
We would probably never come into that house again.	Wy soene nei alle gedachten nea wer yn dat hûs komme.
I believe you.	Ik leau dy.
I do not know about this.	Ik wit net oer dizze.
That's so nice of you.	Dat is sa aardich fan dy.
This guy is good.	Dizze keardel is goed.
It was very early.	It wie hiel betiid.
Then it can be pretty good.	Dan kin it aardich goed.
For everyone and everyone here.	Foar elkenien en elkenien hjir.
There's nothing here for me right now.	Der is hjir no neat foar my.
There had to be another way.	Der moast in oare manier wêze.
What he knew.	Wat hy wist.
She should be home with her children, he thought.	Se soe thús wêze moatte mei har bern, tocht er.
He's my family.	Hy is myn famylje.
I think we will find them better then.	Ik tink dat wy har dan better fine.
She was not afraid of him.	Se wie net bang foar him.
Do not worry.	Doch gjin soargen.
How could they not know.	Hoe koene se it net witte.
I was good to you.	Ik wie goed foar dy.
Where right and wrong are clear.	Wêr't goed en ferkeard dúdlik binne.
He needed no one but himself.	Hy hie nimmen oars nedich as himsels.
There are so many now.	Der binne no safolle.
I tried not to get angry.	Ik besocht net lilk te wurden.
Go home.	Gean nei hûs.
Clearly, that was not to be.	Dúdlik wie dat net te wêzen.
He keeps it to himself.	Hy hâldt him foar himsels.
I could see everything.	Ik koe fan alles sjen.
He was a family person.	Hy wie in famylje persoan.
It could be true.	It soe wier wêze kinne.
This is from you now.	Dit is no fan dy.
Things are not what they once were.	Dingen binne net wat se ea wiene.
That idea she did not like.	Dat idee mocht se net.
But he was whole again.	Mar hy wie wer hiel.
No one will stay here.	Nimmen sil hjir bliuwe.
Let me know your thoughts.	Lit my jo gedachten witte.
All these things had never been done before.	Al dizze dingen wiene noch nea earder dien.
Talk to a friend.	Praat mei in freon.
But we had not seen him.	Mar wy hiene him net sjoen.
I have had more than enough of that today.	Dêr haw ik hjoed mear as genôch fan hân.
I'll be sure of that.	Ik sil der wis fan wêze.
I want to know how he does.	Ik wol witte hoe't er docht.
Maybe he could say he was sick that day.	Miskien koe er sizze dat er dy dei siik west hie.
He did not leave his name.	Hy liet syn namme net.
Had things been a little different.	Hie de dingen mar in bytsje oars west.
Let me help you.	Lit my dy helpe.
She would be there.	Se soe der wêze.
Do not do it.	Doch it net.
I ask a lot of questions.	Ik freegje in protte fragen.
He was never angry.	Hy wie nea lilk.
There was no food to buy.	Der wie gjin iten te keapjen.
All we have is questions.	Alles wat wy hawwe is fragen.
I'm happy for you.	Ik bin bliid foar dy.
I have work to do.	Ik haw wurk te dwaan.
And no one had ever said a word.	En gjinien hie ea in wurd sein.
I saw that kind of thing before.	Ik seach dat soarte earder.
It was the best way.	It wie de bêste manier.
It's not so late.	It is net sa let.
Get away from me and get on with her life.	Kom fuort fan my en gean troch mei har libben.
We can do no more.	Wy kinne net mear dwaan.
I would like to see that.	Dat wol ik graach sjen.
We had no idea what was coming.	Wy hiene gjin idee fan wat der komme soe.
They have to be really nice.	Se moatte echt moai wêze.
I lived with my father.	Ik wenne by myn heit.
She was not happy.	Se wie net bliid.
Shall we eat?	Sille wy ite?
He felt better though.	Hy fielde him wol better.
But the work thing is really hard.	Mar it wurk ding is echt dreech.
I do not know what happened to it now.	Ik wit net wat der no mei bard is.
We get that all.	Wy krije dat allegear.
It eats people.	It yt minsken.
And you can have them.	En jo kinne se hawwe.
We just keep at it.	Wy hâlde it mar oan.
I'm really interested in reading.	Ik bin echt ynteressearre yn it lêzen.
I've seen them.	Ik haw se sjoen.
What happens next, happens.	Wat bart der nei, bart.
Very good then.	Hiel goed dan.
This can be fun.	Dit kin leuk wêze.
I know more than you.	Ik wit mear as jo.
There's something you probably need to know.	D'r is wat dat jo wierskynlik witte moatte.
But it will still not work.	Mar it sil noch altyd net wurkje.
I would just go and see you.	Ik soe gewoan gean en dy sjen.
Feel very good.	Fiel hiel goed.
It is clear that many of you agree.	It is dúdlik dat in protte fan jo it iens binne.
We knew that.	Dat wisten wy.
It is and easy work.	It is en maklik wurk.
It looked good.	It seach der goed út.
But it does not work tonight.	Mar it wurket net fannacht.
He thought he was ready.	Hy tocht dat er klear wie.
She told the truth.	Se fertelde de wierheid.
She thought about everything wrong.	Se tocht oer alles ferkeard.
I'll talk to him.	Ik sil mei him prate.
No more talking.	Net mear praten.
She had no idea how long she had been here.	Se hie gjin idee hoe lang se hjir west hie.
They say very clearly that they were real.	Se sizze hiel dúdlik dat se echt wiene.
Not everyone agreed that this was the best plan.	Net elkenien wie it der oer iens dat dit it bêste plan wie.
I felt it.	Ik fielde it.
They are with me.	Se binne by my.
So it will be again.	Sa sil it wer wêze.
It's been almost a year since we talked.	It is hast in jier lyn dat wy praat hawwe.
No father can tell him what to do.	Gjin heit kin him fertelle wat er dwaan moat.
You must stay with me.	Jo moatte by my bliuwe.
Looking forward to your work.	Sjoch út nei jo wurk.
You want to stay there.	Jo wolle dêr bliuwe.
He was just in time.	Hy wie krekt op tiid.
I just made it.	Ik haw it krekt makke.
Not sure.	Net wis.
They need to know what she is doing.	Se moatte witte wat se docht.
More opportunity for everyone.	Mear kâns foar elkenien.
He opened the door to his office.	Hy die de doar nei syn kantoar iepen.
I'm very good at it.	Ik bin der tige goed yn.
I should have made it clear.	Ik hie it dúdlik meitsje moatten.
He has two days in bed	Hy hat twa dagen op bêd
But perhaps many are unsure.	Mar miskien binne in protte net wis.
So much for that.	Safolle dit.
I had to get her out of here.	Ik moast har hjir wei.
She had never been alone with a boy.	Se hie noch noait allinnich west mei in jonge.
Something happened to her hair.	Der is wat bard mei har hier.
You're going to get some food in you.	Jo geane wat iten yn jo krije.
And he saw something else.	En hy seach noch wat.
To do so would take an entire book.	Om dat te dwaan soe in hiel boek nimme.
But whether that will happen this week remains to be seen.	Mar oft dat dizze wike bart, is noch te sjen.
And that would have been it.	En dat hie dat west.
I'll show myself.	Ik sil my sjen litte.
But she was happy.	Mar se wie bliid.
She does not know.	Se wit it net.
I was never in that.	Dêr wie ik noait yn.
It was not a day.	It wie gjin dei.
She thought hard.	Se tocht hurd.
And of course they do.	En dat dogge se fansels.
I can do anything.	Ik kin alles dwaan.
I could see it really clearly.	Ik koe der echt dúdlik sjen.
She's just not in the room, and then she is.	Se is gewoan net yn 'e keamer, en dan is se.
We have been waiting.	Wy hawwe wachte.
They could not do that themselves.	Dat koene se sels net oan.
That says something.	Dat seit wat.
Let's get ready for him.	Lit ús klear meitsje foar him.
But he also looked back.	Mar hy seach ek werom.
Give him the book, please.	Jou him it boek, asjebleaft.
I want something different.	Ik wol wat oars.
Do you agree or disagree?	Binne jo it iens of net iens?
Is not enough.	Is net genôch.
But well, maybe this is not a problem.	Mar goed, miskien is dit gjin probleem.
And then she could.	En dan koe se.
They are still there.	Se binne der noch.
Let them be sure of that.	Lit se der wis fan wêze.
That makes you hard.	Dat makket dy hurd.
But it's not true.	Mar it is net wier.
Come here now!	Kom hjir no!
He knew he belonged there.	Hy wist dat er dêr hearde.
But this boy.	Mar dizze jonge.
I am going to.	Ik sil.
Things do not always turn out badly.	Dingen komme net altyd min út.
That happened once before.	Dat barde ien kear earder.
Not happening, could never really happen.	Net barre, koe noait echt barre.
Please look forward to it !.	Graach sjoch út nei it!.
I can handle that.	Dat kin ik wol oan.
To us.	Oan ús.
They have more than enough food.	Se hawwe mear as genôch iten.
The police did not tell us.	De plysje hat it ús net ferteld.
We know nothing about where he went.	Wy witte neat oer wêr't er hinne gie.
I just have to see her.	Ik moat har mar sjen.
Not now he's gone.	Net no is er fuort.
You already have more than enough reason to leave.	Jo hawwe al mear as genôch reden om fuort te gean.
You only have one chance.	Jo hawwe mar ien kâns.
We can do it in two months.	Wy kinne it yn twa moanne dwaan.
He wanted much, much more.	Hy woe folle, folle mear.
It really is for me.	It is echt foar my.
He will get used to things.	Hy sil wol oan de dingen wenne.
Do not pay for anything.	Net betelje foar neat.
Not as long as you stay there.	Net sa lang as jo bliuwe dêr.
It was hard.	It wie dreech.
Here's a way.	Hjir is in manier.
You have to let me do this my way.	Jo moatte my dit op myn manier dwaan litte.
Would love to see you there.	Soe dy graach sjen dêr.
Maybe a little more.	Miskien in bytsje mear.
People are talking about it.	Minsken hawwe it der oer.
The new moon is clearly visible tonight.	De nije moanne is fannacht dúdlik te sjen.
I wish him the best.	Ik winskje him dêr it bêste ta.
However, she can not win.	Hoe dan ek, se kin net winne.
Now it's about once an hour.	No is it sa'n ien kear om de oere.
Do not see how he could not.	Sjoch net hoe't er net koe.
She saw people.	Se seach minsken.
I would not be without the house.	Ik soe it hûs net sûnder.
We have enough time.	Wy hawwe genôch tiid.
She loves reading.	Se hâldt fan lêzen.
I knew better than to talk about it at school.	Ik wist wol better as der op skoalle oer te praten.
That was long.	Dat wie lang.
But since you ask.	Mar sûnt jo freegje.
It's what it is, nothing more.	It is wat it is, neat mear.
She can do us no harm.	Se kin ús neat dwaan.
He knew his name.	Hy wist syn namme.
Nice to read.	Leuk om te lêzen.
She was happy to get it.	Se wie bliid om it te krijen.
I am sorry.	It spyt my.
This is one way to do it.	Dit is ien manier om it te dwaan.
It was my only truth.	It wie myn ienige wierheid.
He entered the room.	Hy kaam de keamer yn.
He must have been waiting for her.	Hy moat op har wachte hawwe.
When she went back to.	As se werom gie nei.
So he saw me.	Sa seach er my.
This was the idea.	Dit wie it idee.
That would take hard work.	Dêr soe hurd wurk foar soargje.
We're doing it right.	Wy dogge it goed.
It really has come.	It is echt kommen.
Well, if it was so.	Goed, as it sa wie.
Do not be hurt.	Wês net sear.
He was tired.	Hy wie wurch.
And we will be back.	En wy sille werom wêze.
People are afraid to take them.	Minsken binne bang om se te nimmen.
He need not worry.	Hy moat gjin soargen.
But he never got the chance.	Mar hy krige nea de kâns.
Well, it's late here.	No, it is hjir let.
But he now knew that was not true.	Mar hy wist no dat dat net wier wie.
If he has one.	As hy ien hat.
It's up to us.	It giet oan ús.
There, I never agree with him.	Dêr bin ik it noait mei him iens.
We're leaving as soon as we can.	Wy geane fuort sa gau as wy kinne.
I came here to talk to you.	Ik kaam hjir om mei dy te praten.
See for yourself.	Sjoch sels mar.
She knew it would not be.	Se wist dat it net wêze soe.
It was a few years ago.	It wie in pear jier lyn.
But now it's yours.	Mar no is it fan dy.
And there are good ones.	En der binne goede.
I'm as happy as we are.	Ik bin sa bliid as wy binne.
Not such a thing again, with another man.	Net wer sa'n ding, mei in oare man.
Well, it seemed like the right thing to do.	No, it like it goede ding om te dwaan.
Keep things in place.	Hâld dingen op it plak.
There could be no looking back.	Der koe net werom sjoen wurde.
But she liked it.	Mar se mocht it graach.
I do not think about it.	Ik tink der net oer.
He told her about his regret.	Hy fertelde har oer syn spyt.
Let's not buy anything yet!	Litte wy noch neat keapje!
What will he do then ?.	Wat sil hy dan dwaan?.
The questions become the truth.	De fragen wurde de wierheid.
Up to.	Op nei.
They knew who they were.	Se wisten wa't se wiene.
I'm sure she saw me.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se my sjoen hat.
That's where you're wrong.	Dat is wêr't jo ferkeard binne.
It's just one day.	It is mar ien dei.
We had found them.	Wy hiene se fûn.
He knew what it was.	Hy wist wat it wie.
No one would help me.	Nimmen soe my helpe.
She walked away.	Se rûn fuort.
There it happened.	Dêr barde it.
I know you love him.	Ik wit dat jo fan him hâlde.
But we have better.	Mar wy hawwe better.
He would find a way.	Hy soe in wei fine.
More on that if you need help.	Mear oer it as jo help nedich hawwe.
He does not really like me, 'she said.	Hy hâldt net echt fan my,' sei se.
But do nothing until you talk to me first.	Mar doch neat oant jo earst mei my prate.
Feel free to take the time.	Fiel jo frij om de tiid te nimmen.
It's time to talk.	It is tiid foar gewoan praten.
She lived alone with her dog.	Se wenne allinnich mei har hûn.
even for me.	sels foar my.
Do you have any questions?	Hawwe jo fragen?
When we come.	As wy komme.
There is no saying what they will find.	D'r is gjin sizzen wat se sille fine.
He did not know why that scared him, but it did.	Hy wist net wêrom dat him bang makke, mar it die.
You can make it as fun as you want.	Jo kinne it sa leuk meitsje as jo wolle.
You can really see everything.	Jo kinne echt alles sjen.
But it was not easy.	Mar it wie net maklik.
She will know.	Se sil witte.
Easy for him.	Maklik foar him.
But things are a bit different now.	Mar dingen binne no wat oars.
I wondered how they could leave me like that.	Ik frege my ôf hoe't se my sa litte koene.
I did not know things otherwise.	Ik wist de dingen oars net.
Not like she was worried or anything.	Net as wie se soargen of sa.
I joined her.	Ik kaam by har.
I told him to go out.	Ik fertelde him om út te gean.
I can have another one.	Ik kin noch ien ha.
He had done it for her.	Hy hie it foar har dien.
There really is no more to it.	Der is echt net mear oan it.
It has not bothered me since.	It makket my net sûnt.
This is not me, of course.	Dit bin ik net, fansels.
I don't know.	Ik wit it net.
But one thing seems likely.	Mar ien ding liket wierskynlik.
She has always been.	Se hat altyd west.
When was it?	Wannear wie it?
I'm sorry, she said, but.	It spyt my, sei se, mar.
People like it.	Minsken fine it leuk.
That I can not help.	Dat kin ik net helpe.
I just want to help you.	Ik wol dy gewoan helpe.
He wanted to live there.	Hy woe dêr wenje.
It makes me sick.	It makket my siik.
He stayed there with his mother and father.	Hy bleau dêr by syn mem en heit.
He was a name, of course.	Hy wie in namme, fansels.
We'll be back.	Wy komme werom.
And wait more.	En wachte mear.
He did it too.	Hy die it ek.
All in one.	Alles yn ien.
Maybe even hours.	Miskien sels oeren.
From there.	Dêr wei.
He was so tired.	Hy wie sa wurch.
I wonder about that.	Ik freegje my dêr ôf.
I want one.	Ik wol wol ien.
Much like his father.	In protte as syn heit.
And they get it.	En se krije it.
Take this man you found.	Nim dizze man dy't jo fûn fûn.
You have to let it go.	Jo moatte it gean litte.
If not.	As oars.
That should be clear by now.	Dat moat no dúdlik wêze.
It scares you.	It makket dy bang.
You should have seen it!	Do hiest it sjen moatten!
I should not have gone.	Ik hie net gean moatten.
She could not look at him.	Se koe net nei him sjen.
We do not like it.	Wy fine it net leuk.
This was no time to go back.	Dit wie gjin tiid om werom te gean.
See that she is happy.	Sjoch dat se bliid is.
This would hurt.	Dit soe sear dwaan.
She was where she belonged.	Se wie wêr't se hearde.
Not his father.	Syn heit net.
It was clear we needed help.	It wie dúdlik dat wy help nedich wiene.
He could say or do nothing, of course.	Hy koe neat sizze of dwaan, fansels.
I think the guy.	Ik tink de keardel.
Without being anything.	Sûnder neat te wêzen.
When no one was there.	Doe't der gjinien by wie.
It kept looking at us.	It bleau nei ús sjen.
You may have even wondered how they work.	Jo hawwe miskien sels tocht hoe't se wurkje.
I'm sitting on one now.	Ik sit no op ien.
Something else was not added.	Der kaam noch wat net by.
You do not have to do this now.	Jo hoege dit no net te dwaan.
He was the father of this whole thing.	Hy wie de heit fan dit hiele ding.
I never wore it.	Ik hie it noait oan.
Come on.	Kom no mei.
This way you will know that they are real.	Op dizze manier sille jo witte dat se echt binne.
Tell it to do things.	Fertel it om dingen te dwaan.
You just have to say nothing about it.	Jo moatte der gewoan neat oer sizze.
We will never let this happen again.	Wy litte dit noait wer barre.
Is no longer just.	Is net mear gewoan.
It's not really easy to say.	It is net echt maklik te sizzen.
That was clear.	Dat wie dúdlik.
The lake is his home.	De mar is syn thús.
What were we different.	Wat wiene wy ​​oars.
She had become the woman again.	Se wie wer de frou wurden.
The man looked on.	De man seach nei.
He tried to speak but could not.	Hy besocht te praten, mar koe net.
But one person did this.	Mar ien persoan die dit.
That's one thing about money.	Dat is ien ding oer jild.
I think is a good one.	Ik tink is in goede.
I did not find it a good idea.	Ik fûn it net in goed idee.
They were all alive.	Se wiene allegear yn libben.
He should do that altogether.	Hy soe dat hielendal dwaan moatte.
You have to see it.	Jo moatte it sjen.
Make it clear to him.	Meitsje him dat dúdlik.
It did not happen often.	It barde net faak.
We are all clear.	Wy binne allegear dúdlik.
He had told her he wanted everything from her.	Hy hie har sein dat er alles fan har woe.
It looked beautiful.	It like moai.
They're just people.	It binne gewoan minsken.
The police do not know what to do.	De plysje wit net wat te dwaan.
All that is true.	Alles dat is wier.
It's just easy to do.	Dit is net maklik te dwaan.
Never doubt it.	Twifelje der noait oan.
I looked around.	Ik seach him om.
She had to win.	Se moast winne.
This girl goes to school every day.	Dit famke giet alle dagen nei skoalle.
I feel.	ik fiel.
But next time it may be different.	Mar de folgjende kear kin it oars.
He himself did no work.	Hy die sels gjin wurk.
We say.	Wy sizze.
You really have to go to where the people are.	Jo moatte echt gean nei wêr't de minsken binne.
It just happened.	It is gewoan bard.
I never heard from him again.	Ik hearde nea wer fan him.
Tomorrow will be another day for me.	Moarn sil my mar wer in dei wêze.
That's what you told me yourself.	Dat hawwe jo my sels ferteld.
There that is better.	Dêr is dat better.
Happy weekend!.	Goed wykein!.
We do for each other.	Wy dogge foar elkoar.
She might have done that before.	Dat hie se miskien earder dien.
In fact, one family did not leave.	Eins gie ien famylje net fuort.
It's just like that.	It is gewoan sa.
Once upon a time, she even went to get it.	Eartiids gie se sels om it te krijen.
And maybe it's not necessary.	En miskien is it net nedich.
That is the 'where'.	Dat is it 'wêr'.
You know what's going on.	Jo witte wat der bart.
That's all we ask.	Dat is alles wat wy freegje.
Let's see what they can do.	Litte wy sjen wat se kinne dwaan.
Take him in her.	Nim him yn har.
You will become what you are.	Jo sille wurde wat jo binne.
I'm sorry it has to come this way.	It spyt my dat it sa komme moat.
I can not help it.	Ik kin it net helpe.
But, you keep believing, it could happen this year.	Mar, jo hâlde it leauwe, it kin dit jier barre.
I do not know what you're talking about.	Ik wit net wêr't jo it oer hawwe.
All in the same city.	Allegear yn deselde stêd.
Be with your friends.	Wês mei dyn freonen.
This is not true of course.	Dit is net wier fansels.
Maybe that would be good.	Miskien soe dat wol goed wêze.
They talk about it.	Se prate der oer.
She looked in the door.	Se seach de doar yn.
He has the best hand.	Hy hat de bêste hân.
The boy walked over to the girl.	De jonge rûn nei it famke ta.
And there is your mother.	En dêr is dyn mem.
Ask what happened.	Freegje wat der bard is.
Clearly, it did.	Dúdlik, it die.
There will be no next child.	Der sil gjin folgjende bern wêze.
And that was probably good.	En dat wie wierskynlik goed.
I can still play.	Ik kin noch spylje.
Three times a week.	Trije kear yn 'e wike.
She seemed better for it.	Se like der better foar.
How do we get there? 	Hoe komme wy dêr?
asked the girl.	frege it famke.
Works for me.	Wurket foar my.
That seems like a bad idea.	Dat liket in min idee.
I thought of you.	Ik haw oan dy tocht.
I had never seen the man before.	Ik hie de man noch noait earder sjoen.
What are the three best things?	Wat binne de trije bêste dingen?
Of things that never go wrong for you.	Fan dingen dy't noait ferkeard geane foar jo.
And he's a bad guy.	En hy is in minne keardel.
It must be as she thought it.	It moat sa wêze as se it tocht.
Not about me.	Net oer my.
I'm not talking.	Ik praat net.
I ask him where you are going.	Ik freegje him wêr't jo hinne geane.
It seems so wrong.	It liket sa ferkeard.
There is not much hope for this child.	Der is net folle hope foar dit bern.
I stayed out of it.	Ik bleau der út.
But they were not a few years ago.	Mar se wiene net in pear jier lyn.
Come on, come on.	Kom op, kom op.
This was so.	Dit wie sa.
Not in a car, not in a house, no where.	Net yn in auto, net yn in hûs, gjin wêr.
He looked over you.	Hy seach dy oer.
I want to be sure.	Ik wol der wis fan wêze.
I'm coming home.	Ik kom thús.
That it can be.	Dat it kin wêze.
I do not know him.	Ik wit him net.
Not once, in more than thirty years together.	Net ien kear, yn mear as tritich jier tegearre.
It's like making the bed for his children.	It is as makket er it bêd foar syn bern.
I think of her all the time.	Ik tink de hiele tiid oan har.
That's what people say.	Dat sizze de minsken.
He did not like much.	Hy mocht net folle.
We did not have the money to look good.	Wy hiene net it jild om der goed út te sjen.
That's not good.	Dat is net goed.
Another week for us.	Noch in wike foar ús.
And now, he will not.	En no, hy sil net.
I've never been scared in my whole life.	Ik haw myn hiele libben noait mear bang west.
I know you know things.	Ik wit dat jo dingen witte.
But not for me and him.	Mar net foar my en him.
Everyone is so nice.	Elkenien is sa aardich.
Just for a few days.	Krekt foar in pear dagen.
I'm not trying to get involved.	Ik besykje net mei te dwaan.
I will ask him next time.	Ik sil him de folgjende kear freegje.
Otherwise it would stop.	Oars soe it ophâlde.
Now in bed.	No op bêd.
If someone does bad things, you do well in return.	As immen min docht, dogge jo goed werom.
She had my hand in hers.	Se hie myn hân yn har hân.
It did us both good.	It die ús beide goed.
Let me think now.	Lit my no tinke.
Very.	Hiel.
I can not stay in bed.	Ik kin net op bêd bliuwe.
Quite a few make it.	In hiel pear meitsje it.
Last year had a nice year.	Ferline jier in moai jier hân.
To the.	Nei de.
How is yours.	Hoe is dyn.
Everything went according to plan.	Alles gie nei plan.
It was his first.	It wie syn earste.
That's what I would like to do.	Dat soe ik graach dwaan.
But so life is exactly.	Mar sa is it libben krekt.
He did it.	Hy die it.
Look at this guy.	Sjoch nei dizze keardel.
We all agree that we should.	Wy binne it allegear iens dat wy moatte.
It was such a week for me.	It wie sa'n wike foar my.
She has problems.	Se hat problemen.
There is nothing to do now.	Der is no neat te dwaan.
You will see what you get.	Jo sille sjen wat jo krije.
It's not exactly clear why.	It is net krekt dúdlik wêrom.
She went out of town.	Se gie de stêd út.
And now think of my father.	En tink no oan myn heit.
And here it is.	En hjir is it.
And maybe she wants to.	En miskien wol se dat wol.
And no one had seen him.	En nimmen hie him sjoen.
Well, not so much.	No, net sa folle.
But that would do his family a lot of good.	Mar dat soe syn famylje in protte goed dwaan.
Of course.	Fansels.
See they do it.	Sjoch se dogge it.
It's no longer yours.	It is net mear fan jo.
In fact, everything happens at once.	Eins bart alles yn ien kear.
Do not be afraid.	Wês net bang.
I knew something was coming.	Ik wist dat der wat kaam.
The man asked, "What time do you open?"	De man frege: "Hoe let dogge jo iepen?"
I'm scared to do anything.	Ik bin bang om wat te dwaan.
That was not too difficult.	Dat wie net al te dreech.
They can not get away from it.	Se kinne der net fan ôf.
I'll tell you what's going to happen.	Ik sil dy fertelle wat der barre sil.
he says.	hy seit.
I did not think so.	Ik tocht net.
It was too late to go back now.	It wie te let om no werom te gean.
It's hard for me to read it.	It is dreech foar my om it te lêzen.
And that's there too.	En dat is der ek.
They just do not talk like that.	Se prate gewoan net sa.
It becomes his new office.	It wurdt syn nije kantoar.
Or if it was, no one told me.	Of as it wie, gjinien fertelde my.
So there are a lot of things we can not know.	Dat d'r binne in protte dingen dy't wy net kinne witte.
That just seemed wrong.	Dat like krekt ferkeard.
They work from home.	Se wurkje fan hûs út.
The time to be happy is now.	De tiid om bliid te wêzen is no.
He was not ready for the day.	Hy wie net klear foar de dei.
We find that they were not.	Wy fine dat se net wiene.
Someone told her she was fine.	Immen fertelle dat se goed wie.
I have no idea what it is.	Ik ha gjin idee wat it is.
And he really came alive for us.	En hy kaam echt libben foar ús.
That does not matter now.	Dat hoecht no net.
He wasn't even sure she was wrong.	Hy wie der net iens wis fan dat se ferkeard wie.
But she had nothing to do with what it was, or not.	Mar se hie der neat oan, wat it wie, of net.
That was him.	Dat wie hy.
He did not want you to know.	Hy woe net dat jo witte.
I do not want to talk about it.	Ik wol der net oer prate.
He was my best friend.	Hy wie myn bêste freon.
I love watching people eat.	Ik hâld fan minsken te sjen iten.
He stayed home, not even visiting his parents.	Hy bleau thús, en besocht net iens syn âlden.
You do not address the issue.	Jo nimme it probleem net op.
That's his whole thing.	Dat is syn hiele ding.
A friend came to my house.	In freon kaam nei myn hûs.
I'm not different.	Ik bin net oars.
I was in there.	Ik wie der yn.
They still have to go back.	Se moatte noch werom.
Do it this way, not that way.	Doch it op dizze manier, net op dy manier.
You do not have to work.	Jo hoege net op it wurk.
He still gets tired easily.	Hy wurch noch maklik.
That should be more than enough.	Dat soe mear as genôch wêze moatte.
I can not make the next meeting.	Ik kin de folgjende gearkomste net meitsje.
People love this.	Minsken hâlde fan dit.
I would talk to him in a different way now.	Ik soe no op in oare manier mei him prate.
You do not like the work.	Jo fine it wurk net leuk.
So has mine.	Dat hat myn ek.
She opened the letter and began to read.	Se die de brief iepen en begûn te lêzen.
Dad had a job there too.	Heit hie dêr ek in baan.
Do not think anyone else has heard of it.	Tink net dat immen oars heard hat.
He would now be in bed.	Hy soe no wol op bêd.
But it could.	Mar it koe wol.
Didn't hurt you.	Moast dy net sear hawwe.
Nothing will happen to you.	Der sil neat mei dy barre.
She likes it busy.	Se hat it graach drok.
I have never dealt with them.	Ik haw noait mei har oan 'e hân.
I have worked with him before.	Ik haw earder mei him wurke.
He had to.	Hy moast.
Where there is nothing.	Wêr't neat is.
It works well with me.	It wurket goed mei my.
Still do to this day.	Noch dwaan oant hjoed de dei.
One he had hoped he would never make.	Ien dy't er hope hie dat er nea meitsje moast.
We have no idea how to do it.	Wy hawwe gjin idee hoe te dwaan it.
We have none.	Wy hawwe gjin.
I think that's for another time.	Ik tink dat dat foar in oare kear is.
But this time he had to.	Mar dizze kear moast er.
He really wanted something more.	Hy woe wier wat mear.
He wants his money back.	Hy wol syn jild werom.
I agree with you here too.	Ik bin it hjir ek mei iens.
The food is bad.	It iten is min.
He wanted to be alone.	Hy woe allinnich wêze.
Tomorrow was a big day for both.	Moarn wie in grutte dei foar beide.
This must be done.	Dit moat dien wurde.
I can not believe she's here.	Ik kin it net leauwe dat se hjir is.
About my mother.	Oer myn mem.
I'm enough.	Ik bin genôch.
I was glad I could help.	Ik wie bliid dat ik helpe koe.
I thought it was good.	Ik tocht dat it goed wie.
I would worry.	Ik soe soargen.
She should no longer be afraid of her husband.	Se moat net mear bang wêze foar har man.
They know better.	Se witte better.
It seemed like her time was bad.	It like har tiid wie min.
You will need money, for one thing.	Jo sille jild nedich hawwe, foar ien ding.
They may be back soon.	Se kinne gau werom wêze.
If we do it right, they will never.	As wy it goed dogge, sille se noait.
They can not hold.	Se kinne net hâlde.
She could easily get away.	Se koe maklik fuort.
How old he has become.	Wat is er âld wurden.
More than good.	Mear dan goed.
We want to try to keep it as we can.	Wy wolle besykje it te hâlden as wy kinne.
He looked back.	Hy seach werom.
He just wanted to do it.	Hy woe dit net dwaan.
Take these things home.	Nim dizze dingen mei nei hûs.
It's me again.	It bin ik wer.
Maybe in the next life.	Miskien yn it folgjende libben.
It was really easy actually.	It wie echt maklik eins.
I never got sick.	Ik bin noait siik wurden.
It's nice to be here with her.	It is moai om hjir by har te wêzen.
I was really glad they did.	Ik wie echt bliid dat se dat diene.
I have a dog that is my child.	Ik haw in hûn dy't myn bern is.
The kids do that.	De bern dogge dat.
This question is too difficult for me.	Dizze fraach is my te dreech.
I doubt we'll get more tonight.	Ik twifelje dat wy fannacht mear krije.
He can not come to you.	Hy kin net by dy komme.
He got there.	Hy kaam der oan.
And this is one of those.	En dit is ien fan dy.
It works.	It wurket.
All things go on.	Alle dingen geane troch.
Well, enough about me.	No, genôch oer my.
I'm not sure.	Ik bin der wis fan net.
I made up the whole thing.	Ik makke it hiele ding op.
And a nice thing.	En in moai ding.
I do not want to be that person anymore.	Ik wol dy persoan net mear wêze.
Maybe something from me.	Miskien wat fan my.
We are not the same.	Wy binne net itselde.
Anyway, nice to see you here.	Hoe dan ek, moai om dy hjir te sjen.
Well, good for her.	No, goed foar har.
There just had to be more to come in life.	Der moast gewoan mear yn it libben komme.
We take it back to where it came from.	Wy nimme it werom wêr't it wei kaam.
People who believe in it have no idea why they do it.	Minsken dy't der yn leauwe, hawwe gjin idee wêrom't se dat dogge.
And that's a good thing.	En dat is in goede dingen.
I dare say.	Ik doar te sizzen.
Everything else is nice to have.	Al it oare is moai om te hawwen.
It was just me.	It wie gewoan my.
In fact, he really wanted to.	Eins woe er hiel graach.
As if she knew something.	As wist se wat.
We are sorry too.	It spyt ús ek.
Do more now.	No mear dwaan.
But it may be that he will not visit the place.	Mar it kin wêze dat hy it plak net besykje sil.
Sit there.	Sit dêr.
You know what this is.	Jo witte wat dit is.
I do not know what he did to you.	Ik wit net wat er dy dien hat.
They want it.	Se wolle dit.
You can get people to give you more money.	Jo kinne minsken krije om jo mear jild te jaan.
Which was true enough.	Wat wier genôch wie.
You know it's coming, and it's coming.	Jo witte dat it komt, en it komt.
I know nothing of that.	Dêr wit ik neat fan.
Also just in time.	Ek krekt op tiid.
She wanted to be with us.	Se woe mei ús.
Your father.	Dyn heit .
I have nothing to do with that one more time.	Ik ha der neat oan om dat noch ien kear te dwaan.
He said he had never heard that before.	Hy sei dat er dat noch noait earder heard hie.
I do not make friends easily.	Ik meitsje net maklik freonen.
Probably a lot of time.	Wierskynlik in protte tiid.
And know it too.	En wit it ek.
They have it to say.	Se hawwe it sizzen.
I've never seen her go that way before.	Ik seach har noch noait op dy manier gean.
And that, my friends, was very very good.	En dat, myn freonen, wie hiel hiel goed.
I know you can.	Ik wit dat jo kinne.
Well, more or less.	No, min of mear.
They are not even worried about people.	Se binne net iens soargen oer minsken.
What it takes.	Wat it nedich is.
Come on, she thought.	Kom op, tocht se.
You have to worry.	Jo moatte soargje.
People just want to believe.	Minsken wolle gewoan leauwe.
I can not talk to you.	Ik kin net mei dy prate.
I'm sorry it was her.	It spyt my dat it har wie.
Her best friend.	Har bêste freon.
But that was just me.	Mar dat wie krekt my.
You're not real.	Do bist net echt.
I have never met these people.	Ik haw dizze minsken noait moete.
I know now enough to give words to what it was.	Ik wit no genôch om wurden te jaan oan wat it wie.
She had no idea what she was going to do.	Se hie gjin idee wat se dwaan soe.
But only in this place.	Mar allinnich op dit plak.
I wanted one in my house.	Ik woe ien yn myn hûs.
But he soon realized that it could be nothing.	Mar hy realisearre al gau dat it neat wêze koe.
Neither worked.	Gjin fan beide wurke.
I did it for him.	Ik die it foar him.
These are people.	Dit binne minsken.
Is out there.	Is der út.
You just look like him.	Jo lykje krekt op him.
I still have that problem.	Ik ha dat probleem noch.
Only once a week.	Allinnich ien kear yn 'e wike.
She was not too happy to be late.	Se wie net al te bliid om te let te kommen.
Make it a size.	Meitsje it in grutte.
The kids love it too.	De bern hâlde der ek fan.
But am happy now.	Mar bin no bliid.
She was one of those people.	Se wie ien fan dy minsken.
What for tomorrow.	Wat foar moarn.
But you are something very different.	Mar do bist wat hiel oars.
She told me that her friend was waiting for her.	Se fertelde my dat har freon op har wachte.
I was there again.	Ik wie der wer by.
I hurt him again.	Ik haw him wer sear dien.
I was not happy.	Ik wie net bliid.
That was even clear to her.	Dat wie sels foar har dúdlik.
And anyone can do it.	En elkenien kin it dwaan.
What would happen then, no one would be sure.	Wat dan barre soe, soe nimmen wis wêze.
It was not an old place, it was my place.	It wie gjin âld plak, it wie myn plak.
Do what works.	Doch wat wurket.
He submerged them.	Hy die se ûnder wetter.
Do not want to think about it.	Wol der net oan tinke.
If there was anything, he would find it.	As der wat wie, soe hy it fine.
There's been enough time to tell me the truth.	D'r is genôch tiid west om my de wierheid te fertellen.
I do not allow it.	Ik lit it net ta.
That kind of thing comes around.	Dat soarte ding komt om.
That's all you need to know.	Dat is alles wat jo witte moatte.
It was not going to work.	It wie net gean.
I do not regret it as much as you.	It spyt my der net sa folle as dy.
There is a letter from her school.	Der is in brief fan har skoalle.
I will not have it in my house.	Ik sil it net yn myn hûs hawwe.
It was of course pretty clear what had happened.	It wie fansels aardich dúdlik wat der bard is.
If that had happened to us.	As dat ús bard wie.
If what you do works for you, that's fine.	As wat jo dogge foar jo wurket, is dat goed.
People he had to see.	Minsken dy't er sjen moast.
But who could see it.	Mar wa koe it sjen.
In truth, they did.	Yn wierheid, se diene.
That will not do it.	Dat sil it net dwaan.
It used to be.	It wie eartiids.
It's his name.	It is syn namme.
Well, so far.	No, oant no ta.
We are not heard.	Wy wurde net heard.
Which is too long.	Wat te lang is.
I need to get something.	Ik moat wat krije.
I really should.	Ik soe echt moatte.
Maybe tomorrow, maybe in a year.	Miskien moarn, miskien oer in jier.
I never have.	Ik haw noait.
Do it right.	Doch it goed.
She had to find food.	Se moast iten fine.
She came up with nothing.	Dêr kaam se neat mei.
I see no one else.	Ik sjoch gjinien oars.
It's not enough.	It is net genôch.
She now lives alone.	Se wennet no allinnich.
He knew she was coming back to him.	Hy wist dat se werom nei him kaam.
Only that it is difficult to do so.	Allinnich dat it dreech is om dat te dwaan.
Not fun.	Net leuk.
And that's me.	En dat bin ik.
If He loves them, He will return to you.	As er graach se, Hy sil werom nei dy.
Believe it or not, you are not alone.	Leau it of net, do bist net allinnich.
But this one actually works pretty well.	Mar dizze wurket eins aardich goed.
It's never too late.	It is nea te let.
It was not the same room, nor the same bed.	It wie net deselde keamer, noch itselde bêd.
He knew both.	Hy wist beide.
He was not there, but he knows.	Hy wie der net, mar hy wit.
I can not say when.	Ik kin net sizze wannear.
Stick with the plan	Hâld mei it plan
But next weekend it will be.	Mar takom wykein sil it wêze.
There is more to do.	Der is mear te dwaan.
That's done.	Dat is dien.
You help us now.	Jo helpe ús no.
They would have found me, somehow.	Se soene my fûn hawwe, op ien of oare manier.
She has done a lot for me.	Se hat in protte foar my dien.
I want to be free of that.	Dêr wol ik frij fan.
He had never been allowed to speak.	Hy hie nea te praten krigen.
There was life, and no more.	Der wie libben, en net mear.
Then this man comes up.	Dan komt dizze man op.
Nobody could.	Nimmen koe.
They’re in, and they know they can’t get out.	Se binne yn, en se witte dat se net út kinne.
But he said it will not happen.	Mar hy sei dat it net sil barre.
I doubt they will ever come back.	Ik twifelje oft se oait wer werom komme.
This time the problem is different.	Dizze kear is it probleem oars.
It seemed like it was true.	It like wol dat it wier wie.
Please come to the meeting.	Kom asjebleaft nei de gearkomste.
That was not the plan.	Dat wie net it plan.
They have money now.	Se hawwe no jild.
Here's my problem.	Hjir is myn probleem.
There was nothing more for him here.	Der wie hjir neat mear foar him.
This time he was like another man.	Dizze kear wie er as in oare man.
It can be anything.	It kin fan alles wêze.
I hope this can last all year.	Ik hoopje dat dit it hiele jier troch kin.
I'm not going to go over everything again.	Ik gean net wer oer alles.
It was good before this.	It wie goed foardat dit.
I can not make enough.	Ik kin net genôch meitsje.
This is often not true.	Dit is faak net wier.
It's still mine.	It is noch fan my.
We all wish it was different.	Wy winskje allegear dat it oars wie.
He could not stay to see what he had done to him.	Hy koe net bliuwe om te sjen wat er him dien hie.
She did not try to stop him.	Se besocht net him tsjin te hâlden.
I never wanted that.	Dat woe ik noait.
I have to stay here.	Ik moat hjir bliuwe.
But that's just what it's.	Mar dit is net wat dit is.
That’s where we started.	Dêr binne wy ​​begûn.
He found none.	Hy fûn gjinien.
Over and over and over.	Oer en oer en oer.
But clearly not this time.	Mar dúdlik net dizze kear.
You just look a little like tonight.	Jo lykje gewoan in bytsje fannacht.
He can not even hold the water.	Hy kin it wetter net iens hâlde.
I look forward.	Ik sjoch út.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Dêr sit gjin ferkeard yn.
Hope you like it.	Hoopje dat jo it leuk fine.
You let me be.	Jo litte my wêze.
He still did not know everything about her.	Hy wist noch net alles oer har.
That's how it is.	Dat is hoe't it is.
Not to us.	Net oan ús.
And other things too.	En ek oare dingen.
This does not really hold.	Dit hâldt net echt.
If you do not get it now, you will never get it.	As jo ​​​​it no net krije, sille jo it noait krije.
He was in so much trouble.	Hy wie yn safolle problemen.
It hurts even more.	It docht noch mear sear.
The bus was too late.	De bus wie te let.
But he would do so very carefully.	Mar hy soe dat hiel foarsichtich dwaan.
But always something would come.	Mar altyd soe der wat komme.
I would do anything for you.	Ik soe alles foar dy dwaan.
But he knew what was going to happen.	Mar hy wist wat der barre soe.
But we did it.	Mar wy hawwe it dien.
He is still the same.	Hy is noch altyd deselde.
Can't wait.	Kin net wachtsje.
We know how to do it.	Wy witte hoe't it dien wurde moat.
I still remember so well the first day of school.	Ik wit noch sa goed de earste dei fan skoalle.
Or by you.	Of troch dy.
Had a whole family through here last week.	Hie hjir ferline wike in hiele famylje troch west.
And you can just see it.	En jo kinne it gewoan sjen.
Living with so many people was not easy.	Wenje mei safolle minsken wie net maklik.
Neither do you.	Dy ek net.
What a day, he thought.	Wat in dei, tocht er.
He liked her father.	Hy like har heit.
Everyone would have given anything to have it.	Elkenien soe alles jûn hawwe om it te hawwen.
She wanted more, she needed more.	Se woe mear, se hie mear nedich.
I do not know why she does not speak.	Ik wit net wêrom se net praat.
It's your good place.	It is jo goede plak.
But you could not do it without me.	Mar jo koene it ek net sûnder my.
It was so beautiful.	It wie sa moai.
They just worked.	Se wurke gewoan.
For me, it's the only way to get there.	Foar my is it de ienige manier om dêr te kommen.
I had to stop more than once.	Ik moast mear as ien kear ophâlde.
It's been three days since that day.	It is trije dagen lyn sûnt dy dei.
I can never talk him into that.	Dêr kin ik him noait yn prate.
But it does.	Mar it docht.
I'm sure he did not.	Ik bin der wis fan dat hy net dien hat.
Almost everything worked against him.	Hast alles wurke him tsjin.
I told him good work.	Ik fertelde him goed wurk.
She felt she had to get out of there.	Se fielde dat se der út moast.
Can never be the same.	Kin noait itselde wêze.
I wish he had.	Ik woe dat er hie.
Somehow you never think it will happen to you.	Op ien of oare manier tinke jo noait dat it jo sil barre.
It was hard, it was hard.	It wie dreech, it wie dreech.
I've thought so much of you.	Ik ha safolle oan dy tocht.
For a few days it worked well.	Foar in pear dagen wurke it goed.
I look forward to more.	Ik sjoch graach út nei mear.
He joined his two friends.	Hy waard by syn twa freonen.
I knew that.	Dat wist ik wol.
I'm not heard.	Ik bin net heard.
He worked hard.	Hy wurke hurd.
And everyone left.	En elkenien gie fuort.
You will be.	Jo sille wêze.
He never said why.	Hy hat nea sein wêrom.
You just have to wait until they happen.	Jo moatte gewoan wachtsje oant se barre.
He was very tired, and he just wanted to go home.	Hy wie tige wurch, en hy woe gewoan nei hûs.
Not us, actually.	Net wy, eins.
But how to buy it.	Mar hoe te keapjen it.
I myself am not entirely convinced.	Ik bin sels net hielendal oertsjûge.
It never will.	It sil nea.
We're really, really worried about this.	Wy binne echt, echt soargen oer dit.
Only one worked.	Der wurke mar ien.
What you need.	Wat jo nedich hawwe.
Sure, we can talk now if you want.	Wis, wy kinne no prate as jo wolle.
We were kids and best friends together.	Wy wiene tegearre bern en bêste freonen.
As if it had never happened.	As wie it noait bard.
We have one good one.	Wy hawwe ien goede.
Everyone talks about it and nobody cares.	Elkenien praat der oer en nimmen docht der neat oan.
There are a few who would like both.	D'r binne in pear dy't beide graach wolle.
Take the thing.	Nim it ding.
Must be.	Moast wêze.
I tried to go to her.	Ik besocht nei har te gean.
And it will be.	En it sil wêze.
He does not care about us.	Hy makket neat oer ús.
It gave me a lot.	It joech my in protte.
He will always have a family with her.	Hy sil altyd in famylje by har hawwe.
What can be done will be done.	Wat kin dien wurde sil dien wurde.
We all go.	Wy geane allegear.
He was the one who had to know things.	Hy wie dejinge dy't dingen witte moast.
These are not bad people.	Dit binne gjin minne minsken.
This thing?	Dit ding?
Not that you were.	Net dat jo wiene.
So everyone knew my father.	Sa koe elkenien myn heit.
Those things were too clear.	Dy dingen wiene te dúdlik.
Live with us.	Wenje by ús.
She would like to help in the office.	Se wol graach helpe op it kantoar.
Nothing else worked.	Neat oars wurke.
We have all day.	Wy hawwe de hiele dei.
But he could not say that.	Mar dat koe er net sizze.
Hope you get the job.	Hoopje dat jo de baan krije.
But she was surprised.	Mar se wie ferrast.
Her book was not very good.	Har boek wie net hiel goed.
Be it so.	Wês it sa.
He comes and goes.	Hy komt en giet.
They go out to eat together.	Se geane tegearre út iten.
But he knew.	Mar hy wist.
That's still here.	Dat is hjir noch dêr.
And went to bed.	En gie op bêd.
But today is different.	Mar hjoed is oars.
What he wants.	Wat er wol.
I see someone.	Ik sjoch immen.
There were none.	Der wiene gjin.
As if it were easy.	As soe it maklik wêze.
More of the same as in the past.	Mear fan itselde as yn it ferline.
I do not have a good hand on it.	Ik ha der gjin goede hân op.
She did not like the man.	Se mocht de man net.
Maybe they have it, but saying it does not make it so.	Miskien hawwe se it, mar it sizzen makket it net sa.
They said he would pay for it.	Se seine dat hy der foar betelje soe.
I watched you.	Ik seach dy nei.
And so much it was with me.	En sa folle wie it mei my.
In other words.	Mei oare wurden.
his wife.	syn frou.
It was not his way.	It wie net syn manier.
There is good reason for that.	Dêr is goede reden foar.
My husband says let's go.	Myn man seit litte wy gean.
That was never a problem.	Dat wie nea in probleem.
They want to make a party.	Se wolle in feest meitsje.
I just think it's so.	Ik tink gewoan dat it sa is.
I can not agree.	Ik kin net iens.
I agree with you.	Ik bin it mei dy iens.
They want what they want until they get it.	Se wolle wat se wolle oant se it krije.
I will wait for her.	Ik sil op har wachtsje.
Everything has its time.	Alles hat syn tiid.
You may have hit on something.	Jo kinne hawwe rekke op wat.
In truth, it was never that.	Yn wierheid, it wie nea dat.
I think it can happen.	Ik tink dat it barre kin.
We still do not know why they did it exactly.	Wy witte noch net wêrom se it krekt dien hawwe.
She will know that you love her.	Se sil witte dat jo fan har hâlde.
I do not know for what.	Ik wit net foar wat.
There is nothing too scary.	Der is neat te bang.
There was very little to it.	Der wie tige min oan.
I came back to the city by bus.	Ik kaam werom nei de stêd mei de bus.
It must have been an hour or so.	It moat in oere of wat west hawwe.
She got ready for bed.	Se makke har klear foar bêd.
He did not give it to her.	Hy joech it har net.
I joined for a reason.	Ik die mei foar in reden.
Sure, he had friends, a family.	Wis, hy hie freonen, in famylje.
He's in trouble.	Hy sit yn de problemen.
He took everything from me.	Hy naam alles fan my ôf.
No one has done that.	Net ien hat dat dien.
I can just leave you there.	Ik kin dy dêr mar litte.
She liked it.	Se mocht it graach.
It's ready.	It is klear.
She has a child to deal with.	Se hat in bern om mei te dwaan.
Let me do the talking.	Lit my it praten dwaan.
It was time for us to go.	It wie tiid foar ús om te gean.
Back to normal.	Werom nei gewoan.
You had me there.	Do hiest my der hast.
People come to the party.	Minsken komme nei it feest.
And the people were angry.	En de minsken wiene lilk.
He was not alone for long.	Hy wie net allinnich lang.
He's having the best time ever here.	Hy hat de bêste tiid ea hjir.
But the door did not open either.	Mar de doar gie ek net iepen.
I looked into my hand.	Ik seach yn myn hân.
But do not scare me.	Mar meitsje my net bang.
But often this is not done.	Mar faak wurdt dit net dien.
I still have two hours left.	Ik ha noch twa oeren oer.
They got one.	Se krigen ien.
You have to pay him when you had the chance.	Jo moatte him betelje moatte doe't jo de kâns hiene.
That's mine.	Dy is fan my.
But it is so.	Mar it is sa.
She has become a child.	Se is in bern wurden.
That would not be her.	Dat soe se net wêze.
I want him.	Ik wol him ha.
But there is nothing to say.	Mar der is neat te sizzen.
I did not want her parents to know about us.	Ik woe net dat har âlden fan ús wisten.
We can not get it back from there.	Wy kinne it der net fan werom krije.
But she had things to do.	Mar se hie dingen te dwaan.
But here should not be one.	Mar hjir soe net ien wêze moatte.
Let her believe him.	Lit har him leauwe.
And so it goes.	En sa giet it.
Hope you enjoy staying here.	Hoopje dat jo graach bliuwe hjir.
Can anyone do that.	Kin immen dat dwaan.
Nobody is watching.	Nimmen sjocht nei.
He wondered if he would ever get there.	Hy frege him ôf oft er dêr oait komme soe.
And it's all by you.	En it is allegear troch jo.
Of course they do.	Dat dogge se fansels.
I have no idea what's going on.	Ik ha gjin idee wat der bart.
She said she knows.	Se sei dat se it wit.
To take him back.	Om him werom te nimmen.
He had nowhere else to go.	Hy hie gjin plak oars te gean.
I gave him a letter.	Ik joech him in brief.
I know what's good now.	Ik wit wat no goed is.
This has to go.	Dit moat gean.
He could always tell.	Hy koe altyd fertelle.
So you have to look very carefully at the picture.	Sa moatte jo hiel foarsichtich sjen nei de foto.
I had such a good life.	Ik hie sa'n goed libben.
And he realized something else.	En hy realisearre wat oars.
It got better and it did not happen.	It waard better en it barde net.
But he's gone somehow.	Mar hy is op ien of oare manier fuort.
That, itself, has its name.	Dat, sels, hat har namme.
He knew that.	Dat wist er.
Nothing to do at our office.	Neat te dwaan op ús kantoar.
And the thing has not even begun yet.	En it ding is noch net iens begûn.
I want to do for you and take care of you.	Ik wol foar dy dwaan en foar dy soargje.
They would never do that.	Dat soene se noait dwaan.
We are hurt.	Wy binne sear.
If that's what it's.	As dat is wat it is.
That's my letter.	Dat is myn brief.
Keep this in mind then.	Hâld dit dan yn gedachten.
You never asked me anything.	Jo hawwe my noait wat frege.
Finding what needs to be found.	It finen fan wat fûn wurde moat.
Well, she had.	No, se hie.
But here we are.	Mar hjir binne wy.
I tried to talk.	Ik besocht te praten.
Trying to do too much.	Besykje te folle te dwaan.
There needs to be a better word.	Der moat in better wurd komme.
If done right, it really works.	As it goed dien wurdt, wurket it echt.
I love that girl.	Ik hâld fan dat famke.
This one does that though.	Dizze docht dat wol.
Watch it, play it.	Sjoch it, spylje it.
They never met again.	Se moete nea wer.
Not much was found there either.	Dêr is ek net folle fûn.
He should get the child a dog.	Hy soe it bern in hûn krije moatte.
I had seen that myself.	Dat hie ik sels sjoen.
I went back there.	Ik gie der werom.
For me, it's fun to see them.	Foar my is it leuk om se te sjen.
Her husband was never home.	Har man wie nea thús.
And it's good that you have to.	En it is goed dat jo moatte.
But we do not think so.	Mar dat tinke wy net.
Not many people know about this.	Net in protte minsken witte oer dit.
Or her hair.	Of har hier.
You are more than enough.	Jo binne mear as genôch.
He had not been.	Hy hie net west.
I'll make him think you're my wife.	Ik sil him tinke litte datst myn frou bist.
All or nothing.	Alles of neat.
What he liked was no one interested in.	Wat er leuk hie, wie gjinien ynteressearre yn.
That was for me like yesterday.	Dat wie foar my as juster.
We live here now.	Wy wenje hjir no.
I came out to see.	Ik kaam út om te sjen.
But that comes down to who they are.	Mar dat komt troch wa't se binne.
Let me be clear.	Lit my dúdlik wêze.
There is no money.	Der is gjin jild.
They had been waiting for hours.	Se hiene al oeren wachte.
Not that she's letting me help her now.	Net dat se my har no helpe lit.
He had a boyfriend, it seemed.	Hy hie in freon, like it.
They can not be.	Se kinne net wêze.
I have to get back to work.	Ik moat wer oan it wurk.
But it seems too obvious.	Mar it liket te dúdlik.
I'd better see if he's home.	Ik soe better sjen oft er thús is.
Everything came out well for me.	Alles kaam my goed út.
She did not want to talk to anyone else.	Se woe net mei immen oars prate.
You need that today.	Jo hawwe dat hjoed nedich.
Leave this to me.	Lit dit oan my oer.
He knew her well enough to see that she was scared.	Hy koe har goed genôch om te sjen dat se bang wie.
Her mother could not.	Har mem koe net.
The more things, the better.	Hoe mear dingen, hoe better.
Once away, it does not come back.	Ien kear fuort, komt it net werom.
I'm ready for it now.	Ik bin der no klear foar.
If so, you can stop reading now.	As dat sa is, kinne jo no ophâlde mei lêzen.
There is work being done.	Der wurdt wurke.
Please help me.	Help my asjebleaft.
I assume it does not.	Ik nim oan dat it net docht.
Sit there.	Sit der mar.
Let me make that clear.	Lit my dat dúdlik meitsje.
It's not the money.	It is net it jild.
There has been a lot of good and some bad.	Der is in protte goed en wat min west.
Tomorrow he will do even more than today.	Moarn docht er noch mear as hjoed.
I had turned thirty a few months earlier.	Ik wie in pear moanne earder tritich wurden.
I think you probably should be in bed.	Ik tink dat jo wierskynlik op bêd moatte.
And there is a reason.	En der is in reden.
Let me know what you think of it now.	Lit my witte wat jo der no fan fine.
He did not say that.	Dat sei er net.
I told him they did not live there.	Ik fertelde him dat se dêr net wenne.
Maybe you're a bit.	Miskien bist in bytsje.
It's a little late now to figure that out.	It is no wat let om dat út te finen.
They do not know the truth.	Se witte de wierheid net.
The reason is the following.	De reden is de folgjende.
I did not look out of place.	Ik seach net út it plak.
What do we know about these people?	Wat witte wy oer dizze minsken?
Until they have to get there.	Oant se der hinne moatte.
This was not my idea.	Dit wie myn idee net.
I'm not sure why that is.	Ik bin der net wis fan wêrom dat sa is.
I'm only telling the truth.	Ik fertel allinnich de wierheid.
That's the first time it's happened.	Dat is de earste kear dat it bart.
She did not care.	Se hoegde net.
I like playing that way.	Ik graach spylje op dy manier.
Until tonight.	Oant fannacht.
I told you this.	Ik haw dy dit sein.
I think it might have happened on his way in.	Ik tink dat it miskien bard is op syn wei yn.
I had to talk.	Ik moast prate.
And it was so good for me.	En it wie sa goed foar my.
You will be here.	Jo sille hjir wêze.
Which was good.	Wat goed wie.
Why not see something more around me? 	Wêrom net wat mear om my hinne sjen?
There I agreed.	Dêr wie ik it mei iens.
But it was not what you think.	Mar it wie net wat jo tinke.
I think he could help you.	Ik tink dat hy jo koe helpe.
He was never seen or heard from again.	Hy waard nea wer sjoen of heard.
It can be so.	It kin sa wêze.
They will be told what to say.	Se sille wurde ferteld wat te sizzen.
And the kind you can get, you do not want.	En de soarte dy't jo krije kinne, wolle jo net.
He has something we do not have, he has the word.	Hy hat wat dat wy net hawwe, hy hat it wurd.
We can not take this.	Wy kinne dit net nimme.
He is afraid of the police.	Hy is bang foar de plysje.
I hope we can next year.	Ik hoopje dat wy it takom jier kinne.
And see where they are today.	En sjoch wêr't se hjoed binne.
They may be on to something.	Se kinne op wat wêze.
Or talk about it.	Of der oer praat.
You have to work to get money.	Jo moatte wurkje om jild te krijen.
It can not help what it looks like.	It kin net helpe hoe't it liket.
So you can be just like me.	Sa kinne jo krekt as ik wêze.
He's going out there.	Hy giet der út.
For her.	Foar har.
And today it is certainly no different than it ever was.	En it is hjoed wis net oars as it ea west hat.
It looked like nothing more.	It like der neat mear oan.
But he had seen.	Mar hy hie sjoen.
I know him well.	Ik ken him goed.
In or out.	Yn of út.
I can not get that back.	Dat kin ik net werom krije.
There are a few people left in the city.	Der binne in pear minsken oer yn 'e stêd.
Do not wait, do not talk, just do.	Net wachtsje, net prate, gewoan dwaan.
But she certainly could not.	Mar hielendal wis koe se net.
It seemed pretty clear.	It like moai dúdlik.
I just wish there was someone else.	Ik woe gewoan dat der ien wie oars.
It makes me want to see so much.	It makket my wol sa folle sjen.
Show her something.	Lit har nei wat sjen.
It would never be him.	It soe him nea wêze.
But tomorrow he will be.	Mar moarn sil er wêze.
Maybe to her.	Miskien oan har.
I do not know more about it than you.	Ik wit der net mear fan as jo.
There will never be another than our boy.	D'r sil noait in oare wêze as ús jonge.
She does what she has to do.	Se docht wat se dwaan moat.
And he knew me.	En hy koe my.
She wants nothing to do with me.	Se wol neat mei my hawwe.
He would come in handy.	Hy soe goed komme.
You have nothing good to say about anything.	Jo hawwe neat goed te sizzen oer neat.
I heard you talking.	Ik hearde dy praten.
See what happens when you work hard?	Sjoch wat der bart as jo hurd wurkje?
He said he did not like her.	Hy sei dat er har net mocht.
But tell us about him.	Mar fertel ús oer him.
That would do, too.	Dat soe ek dwaan.
He would do what she told him, no question.	Hy soe dwaan wat se him sei, gjin fraach.
I've been over it twice.	Ik haw der twa kear oer west.
It seems good to me.	It liket my goed.
In fact, he did.	Eins hat hy it dien.
They would not know about it.	Dêr soene se net fan witte.
Look at our children.	Sjoch op ús bern.
There was a lot to say.	Der wie in protte te sizzen.
Not where you come from.	Net wêr't jo wei komme.
He must stay with us.	Hy moat by ús bliuwe.
You have to try it.	Jo moatte it besykje.
He got there first.	Hy kaam der earst.
Class could not be found.	Klasse koe net fûn wurde.
He asked me what that was.	Hy frege my wat dat wie.
It's very different.	It is hiel oars.
The moon is visible tonight.	De moanne is fannacht te sjen.
Good on me.	Goede ek.
Probably for the best.	Wierskynlik foar it bêste.
There was just no time for that.	Dêr wie gewoan gjin tiid foar.
You're still a free man.	Do bist noch in frij man.
I know you're worried about her.	Ik wit dat jo soargen binne oer har.
That's what he did.	Dat hat er dien.
He had no friends there.	Hy hie dêr gjin freonen.
They want a girl to talk to.	Se wolle in famke om mei te praten.
There was a man sitting inside.	Der siet in man yn.
Well, do what you find best.	No, doch wat jo it bêste fine.
Someone will have done this for you.	Immen sil dit foar jo dien hawwe.
Now he felt everything.	No fielde er alles.
Tell me.	Fertel.
I wish they did.	Ik winskje dat se diene.
I knew he was trying to find the right words.	Ik wist dat hy besocht de goede wurden te finen.
A plan was ready	In plan wie klear
Do that a lot.	Doch dat in protte.
That will not happen again.	Dat sil net wer barre.
He just hoped it was not him.	Hy hope mar dat it him net wie.
Please help me on this.	Help my asjebleaft oer dit.
It probably should have been.	It hie wierskynlik wêze moatten.
Just that they make you one.	Krekt dat se dy ien meitsje.
That's how I felt.	Sa fielde it my wol.
I need it to stay alive.	Ik haw it nedich om yn libben te bliuwen.
That car can not be driven.	Dy auto kin net riden wurde.
I wonder where she lives now.	Ik freegje my ôf wêr't se no wennet.
All kids love you.	Alle bern hâlde fan dy.
I will not be able to see them.	Ik sil se net sjen kinne.
She looked up at me.	Se seach nei my op.
Nothing seems to matter much.	Neat liket in protte út te dwaan.
She came home too tired to deal with food.	Se kaam te wurch thús om har mei iten te dwaan.
The people were nice.	De minsken wiene aardich.
He would still win her over.	Hy soe har noch winne.
I would love to stay.	Ik soe graach bliuwe.
I'll pay for that new week.	Ik sil dy nije wike betelje.
There will not be much work.	Der sil net folle wurk wêze.
Well, now they knew.	No, no wisten se.
Would love to.	Hiel graach wolle.
Let me go a little.	Lit my in bytsje gean.
He had been here.	Hy hie hjir west.
I asked her for her help.	Ik frege har om har help.
She would let her go badly, this was clear.	Se soe har min gean litte, dit wie dúdlik.
They can tell you all about him.	Se kinne jo alles oer him fertelle.
She arrives on time.	Se komt op 'e tiid.
I read what you said.	Ik haw lêzen wat jo seine.
She thought it unlikely.	Se tocht it net wierskynlik.
And it was a kind of work.	En it wie in soarte fan wurk.
I just know it.	Ik wit it gewoan.
You never did that.	Dat hawwe jo noait dien.
The place is open.	It plak is iepen.
I do not need a job.	Ik haw gjin wurk nedich.
I need to talk to her now.	Ik moat no mei har prate.
I love this idea.	Ik hâld fan dit idee.
How often do you go to the movies?	Hoe faak geane jo nei de film?
That he thought the movie was a bad idea.	Dat hy tocht dat de film in min idee wie.
Just to help.	Krekt om te helpen.
I would take it better.	Ik soe it better nimme.
It was what he wanted.	It wie wat er woe.
She did not like him.	Se woe him net leuk fine.
Well, that's exactly what we want.	No, dat is ek krekt wat wy wolle.
I'm home.	Ik bin thús.
Everything he said and then what.	Alles wat hy sei en dan wat.
He would not leave me without one.	Hy soe my net sûnder ien litte litte.
This is the plan of what we will do.	Dit is it plan fan wat wy sille dwaan.
It's so much more.	It is safolle mear.
They love their children.	Se hâlde fan har bern.
I love that place.	Ik hâld fan dat plak.
Everyone knows someone.	Elkenien ken immen.
It just went out.	It gie krekt út.
They work, but they can do much better.	Se wurkje, mar se kinne folle better.
She will like you.	Se sil dy leuk fine.
They love each other.	Se hâlde fan elkoar.
I still had work to do.	Ik hie noch wurk te dwaan.
More than once, maybe.	Mear as ien kear, miskien.
I know this has to do with me.	Ik wit dat dit mei my te krijen hat.
You may like it.	Jo kinne it leuk fine.
He also did not want one.	Hy woe ek net ien hawwe.
But people will always say things.	Mar minsken sille altyd dingen sizze.
Everyone went home happy.	Elkenien gie bliid nei hûs.
Certainly not, he thought.	Wis net, tocht er.
We have it so hard !.	Wy hawwe it sa dreech!.
But only one.	Mar mar ien.
I really did not want to know.	Ik woe it eins net witte.
To this day, no one has talked to me about it.	Oant hjoed de dei hat gjinien der mei my oer praat.
If you do not want to be friends with me, fine.	As jo ​​​​gjin freonen mei my wêze wolle, goed.
I just love it.	Ik hâld der gewoan fan.
We would not need them.	Dy soene wy ​​net nedich hawwe.
I can not say it.	Ik kin it net sizze.
Or do some work.	Of dwaan wat wurk.
But there must be another way.	Mar der moat in oare manier wêze.
Mom was happy.	Mem wie bliid.
That will be so.	Dat sil sa wêze.
No one had much to say.	Nimmen hie folle te sizzen.
People are working on that.	Dêr wurkje minsken oan.
I really got into it.	Ik kaam der echt yn.
What it could have done.	Wat it koe, hie it dien.
I was not so good at this.	Ik wie hjir sa net goed yn.
They must have found something, but they will not tell me anything.	Se moatte wat fûn hawwe, mar se sille my net fertelle wat.
I thought you might like it.	Ik tocht dat jo it miskien leuk fine.
Do not enter.	Jou net yn.
There must be something left.	Der moat wat bliuwe.
I'll see you next week.	Ik sjoch dy takom wike.
He knew what that looked like.	Hy wist hoe't dat like.
The room around me came back.	De keamer om my hinne kaam werom.
And we are.	En wy binne.
It's the right thing to do.	It is it goede ding om te dwaan.
He liked him a lot.	Hy mocht him in protte.
I but he had the money himself.	Ik mar hy hie it jild sels.
You will need him now more than ever.	Jo sille him no mear as ea nedich hawwe.
There was something.	Der wie wat.
I knew the girl.	Ik koe it famke.
We are not happy.	Wy binne net bliid.
He had never been so scared.	Hy hie noch noait sa bang west.
And you do not have to tell anyone what we found here.	En jo moatte gjinien fertelle wat wy hjir fûn hawwe.
And with that said, here we go.	En mei dat sein, hjir geane wy.
He entered his house.	Hy kaam syn hûs yn.
He came away.	Hy kaam fuort.
As much as you can.	Safolle as jo kinne.
He asked him what she would say.	Hy frege him ôf wat se sizze soe.
He had it all, but it was still not enough.	Hy hie it allegear, mar it wie noch net genôch.
She was angry.	Se wie lilk.
Mine never seems to go away.	Myn liket noait fuort te gean.
I hope they go soon.	Ik hoopje dat se gau gean.
Probably he would.	Wierskynlik soe hy.
I would be happy to stay.	Ik soe bliid wêze om te bliuwen.
She walked away.	Se gie fuort.
People need to see it.	Minsken moatte it sjen.
Hurd.	Hurd.
And also not so good.	En ek net sa goed.
Give him everything he ever asked for.	Jou him alles wêr't hy ea om frege.
A little bit.	In bytsje.
My wife, she liked that.	Myn frou, dat mocht se graach.
It has been good to see you again.	It hat west goed om dy wer te sjen.
I could not have done it without the help of my family.	Ik koe it net dien hawwe sûnder de help fan myn famylje.
Remember, there are only three people in our family.	Tink jo, d'r binne mar trije minsken yn ús famylje.
That's where we are today.	Dat is wêr't wy hjoed binne.
Just like the book.	Krekt as it boek.
A few years old.	In pear jier âld.
She is fine and will be happy soon.	Se is goed en sil gau bliid wêze.
He can do nothing.	Hy kin neat dwaan.
Ready for it.	Der klear foar.
I'm all about it hard.	Ik bin alles oer it dreech.
They are beautiful indeed.	Se binne moai eins.
He was clearly tired too.	Hy wie dúdlik ek wurch.
Everything looks good and works well.	Alles sjocht der goed út en wurket goed.
Not much done.	Net folle diene.
She has problems with truth.	Se hat problemen mei wierheid.
Nothing like this has ever been seen in this city.	Neat as dit is ea sjoen yn dizze stêd.
I believe you are.	Ik leau dat jo binne.
Then it's true.	Dan is it wier.
It's one of those things.	It is ien fan de dingen.
We would be together.	Wy soene tegearre wêze.
She's not here anymore.	Se is hjir net mear.
You do not know what you did.	Jo witte net wat jo dien hawwe.
So do three other children in this room.	Sa dogge trije oare bern yn dizze keamer.
It would seem that this is your home.	It soe lykje dat dit jo thús is.
But a car did not.	Mar in auto die it net.
I feel nothing.	Ik fiel neat.
They no longer worked.	Se wurke net mear.
He's an animal.	Hy is in bist.
The other me would probably know more about it.	De oare my soe dêr wierskynlik mear fan witte.
And go into it.	En gean yn it docht.
He must be here now.	Hy moat hjir no wêze.
The last thing she needed was that.	It lêste wat se nedich wie, wie dat.
I'm sick of my job.	Ik bin siik fan myn wurk.
Or will be when they finish it.	Of sil wêze as se klear it.
That's exactly what it is.	Dat is krekt wat it is.
I felt so alone.	Ik fielde my sa allinnich.
If they are not, it is not.	As se net binne, is it net.
That he had to wait.	Dat hy moast wachtsje.
But otherwise they do not.	Mar op in oare manier dogge se dat net.
She tried to make it all happen.	Se besocht it allegear gewoan te meitsjen.
This was more of an issue than she expected.	Dit wie mear in probleem dan se ferwachte.
Everything was clear.	Alles wie dúdlik.
It's good to be back !.	It is goed om werom te wêzen!.
She was very happy.	Se wie tige bliid.
Anyway, here she is.	Hoe dan ek, hjir is se.
It worked so well for the man.	It wurke sa goed foar de man.
I never wanted to do this.	Ik woe dit noait dwaan.
It was very clear that this is it.	It wie hiel dúdlik dat dit it is.
Now you have a problem.	No hawwe jo in probleem.
He was glad he was back.	Hy wie bliid dat er werom wie.
I also know something you do not know.	Ik wit ek wat dat jo net witte.
You need to see how they talk about you.	Jo moatte sjen hoe't se oer jo prate.
It did not know.	It wist net.
And that is not the same.	En dat is net itselde.
Nobody knows what to do.	Nimmen wit wat te dwaan.
Kids have it.	Bern hawwe it.
He started talking again, this time about work.	Hy begûn wer te praten, dit kear oer wurk.
You come in.	Jo komme yn.
We should find a way.	Wy soene in wei fine moatte.
He told me he did it.	Hy fertelde my dat hy it die.
He's just gone.	Hy is krekt fuort.
But it does not matter.	Mar it makket neat út.
He is one of us.	Hy is ien fan ús.
There is too much going on.	Der bart te folle.
Only this month you are late.	Allinnich dizze moanne binne jo te let.
That's the new way.	Dat is de nije manier.
I have no problem.	Ik ha gjin probleem.
And never again will it be so.	En nea mear sil sa wêze.
He felt tired.	Hy fielde him wurch wurde.
He liked where he was now.	Hy mocht graach wêr't er no wie.
I found it sick.	Ik fûn it siik.
Her children were not mine.	Har bern wiene net fan my.
It is open all year round.	It is it hiele jier iepen.
To have faith.	Om leauwe te hawwen.
He gave in.	Hy joech yn.
Good to see you.	Goed om dy te sjen.
On my own.	Allinnich.
We set out in the morning.	Wy sette út 'e moarn.
And it was good.	En it wie goed.
If she had to go home, she would want it.	As se nei hûs moast, soe se it wol.
He had no idea if this thing would work.	Hy hie gjin idee oft dit ding soe wurkje.
He had no words.	Hy hie gjin wurden.
Do with us what you will and we will still love you.	Doch mei ús wat jo wolle en wy sille noch fan dy hâlde.
I was not interested in this.	Ik wie net ynteressearre yn dit.
And that is.	En dat is.
This is what she wants.	Dit is wat se wol.
Nobody knew where.	Nimmen wist wêr.
Parents were happy.	Âlden wiene bliid.
And so it may be.	En sa kin it wêze.
You do not really want that to happen.	Jo wolle net echt dat dat bart.
Nobody lives there.	Dêr wennet nimmen.
I do not know what he is doing with his money.	Ik wit net wat er mei syn jild docht.
Keep it that way.	Hâld dat sa.
Is very good.	Is hiel goed.
She should have known better.	Se hie better witte moatten.
He was now in big trouble.	Hy siet no yn grutte problemen.
It was more about us than about you.	It gie mear oer ús as oer dy.
Things just work and they work just fine.	Dingen wurkje gewoan en se wurkje gewoan goed.
They are nothing.	Se binne neat.
Was not a great man.	Wie gjin grutte man.
There has to be a way to do it.	Der moat in manier wêze om it te dwaan.
Then again, maybe they were.	Dan wer, miskien wiene se.
Is it? 	Is it?
she says.	seit se.
I think everyone should know that.	Ik tink dat elkenien dat witte moat.
In my room.	Yn myn keamer.
Go buy it.	Gean it keapje.
My father was just as bad.	Myn heit wie like min.
Not with us around.	Net mei ús om.
It's it.	It is it.
It is clear that the boy did not want to leave.	It is dúdlik dat de jonge net fuort woe.
I will not tell.	Ik sil it net fertelle.
I tried it, worked well.	Ik besocht it, wurke goed.
The child was eating when the letter arrived.	It bern wie oan it iten doe't de brief kaam.
I've seen him a lot around her lately.	Ik haw him de lêste tiid in protte om har hinne sjoen.
But boy has it got to do with me.	Mar jonge hat it mei my te krijen.
He does not want you to be afraid of anything.	Hy wol net dat jo bang binne foar neat.
But look at you.	Mar sjoch dy.
I did what you said.	Ik die wat jo seine.
And really, there is so much more.	En echt, d'r is safolle mear.
I did that myself.	Dat haw ik sels dien.
My friend was no longer himself.	Myn freon wie net mear himsels.
asked the teacher.	frege de learaar.
She knew exactly what she was doing.	Se wist krekt wat se die.
Maybe you were not wrong two years ago.	Miskien wiene jo twa jier lyn net ferkeard.
There was nothing to tell.	Der wie neat te fertellen.
You need to have a job.	Jo moatte in baan hawwe.
You have to get hard.	Jo moatte hurd wurde.
Really, just beautiful.	Echt, gewoan moai.
She wanted to know what he wanted to know.	Se woe witte wat er witte woe.
He seemed more than ready for her to be gone.	Hy like mear as ree foar har te wêzen fuort.
Ever, always, always.	Ea, altyd, altyd.
Not too long ago.	Net al te lang lyn.
I'm ready, he thought.	Ik bin klear foar, tocht er.
But it's hard.	Mar it is dreech.
He can not leave.	Hy kin net fuort.
Think about what you have done!	Tink oer wat jo dien hawwe!
And of course, you are not.	En fansels, do bist net.
Today it does not work.	Hjoed wurket it net.
I have many friends who love me.	Ik haw in protte freonen dy't fan my hâlde.
He did some things himself.	Hy hat wat dingen sels dien.
He would help everyone in trouble.	Hy soe elkenien helpe yn problemen.
Well, it's pretty simple.	No, it is frij gewoan.
That's pretty clear now.	Dat is no aardich dúdlik.
They want you to be better than you are.	Se wolle dat jo better binne as jo binne.
It's her one chance.	It is har ien kâns.
In and out.	Yn en út.
It can be one word like many.	It kin ien wurd wêze as in protte.
Here is everything he had to say.	Hjir is alles wat er te sizzen hie.
And a mother too.	En in mem ek.
Here and there.	Hjir en dêr.
I will do everything for you.	Ik sil alles foar dy dwaan.
I think you're single.	Ik tink do bist ien.
The police will look into it.	De plysje sil der nei sjen.
Three had no reason to tell him.	Trije hiene gjin reden om it him te fertellen.
There was a sort of.	Der wie in soarte fan.
Come on.	Kom oer.
It did her no good.	It die har gjin goed.
They could hardly do otherwise.	Se koene hast net oars.
But maybe this is just as good.	Mar miskien is dit like goed.
I'm going to talk to him.	Ik gean mei him prate.
Give it to me now.	Jou it my no.
It had been a whole day.	It wie in hiele dei west.
And he looks at himself.	En hy sjocht nei himsels.
The truth is now the problem.	De wierheid is no it probleem.
That name I had heard before.	Dy namme hie ik earder heard.
I should go back.	Ik soe werom moatte.
I'm just telling you something.	Ik fertel dy mar wat.
Look at it yourself first.	Sjoch der earst sels nei.
It probably does not matter.	It makket wierskynlik net út.
This is just for us.	Dit is gewoan foar ús.
It's up to him.	It is oan him.
I'm talking to her.	Ik praat mei har.
I know exactly where you're going through.	Ik wit krekt wêr't jo troch geane.
Dad was at the mine.	Heit wie by de myn.
If not, nothing happens.	As der net is, bart der neat.
The police asked me that.	De plysje frege my dat.
I'll get to that.	Ik kom der wol op.
He said he did not do it.	Hy sei dat er it net die.
But this one is made so carefully.	Mar dizze is sa foarsichtich makke.
I know you can see them too.	Ik wit dat jo se ek sjen kinne.
The police stopped the car.	De plysje sette de auto oan.
My mother never said a word.	Myn mem sei noait in wurd.
That's the truth.	Dat is de wierheid.
I know how that is.	Ik wit hoe't dat is.
You love them, of course.	Jo hâlde fan har, fansels.
You just want out.	Jo wolle gewoan út.
I pay.	Ik betelje.
Now he had three.	No hie er trije.
I never got there.	Ik kaam der noait oan.
I just have to be careful.	Ik moat mar foarsichtich wêze.
Well, she knew a lot of people.	No, se koe in protte minsken.
They go through things.	Se geane troch dingen.
It looked like an old man.	It like in âld man.
You know everything you need to know.	Jo witte alles wat jo witte moatte.
It could be anything.	It koe neat wêze.
There's just no way around that.	Der is gewoan gjin wei om dat hinne.
We have nothing to do tonight.	Wy hoege fannacht neat te dwaan.
You go on.	Jo geane troch.
They will help me.	Se sille my helpe.
Not a hair out of place.	Net in hier út syn plak.
He came to my house today.	Hy kaam hjoed by my thús.
I love you, girl.	Ik hâld fan dy, famke.
Maybe no one was good enough.	Miskien wie nimmen goed genôch.
But he had nothing more to do with it.	Mar hy hie der neat mear oan.
She said who she was.	Se sei wa't se wie.
Just try it, you will like it.	Besykje it gewoan, jo sille it leuk fine.
I'm telling you something.	Ik fertel dy wat.
Just what you want.	Krekt wat jo wolle.
But you have what they will never have, what they do.	Mar jo hawwe wat se sille nea hawwe, wat se dogge.
I knew my job.	Ik wist myn wurk.
Mom came out.	Mem kaam út.
He himself did not feel much better.	Hy hie it sels net folle better.
I did it pretty well.	Ik die it aardich goed.
We were at her house.	Wy wiene by har thús.
So often.	Sa faak.
Her teacher made her work hard.	Har learaar liet har hurd wurkje.
He was always waiting to get home.	Hy wachte altyd om thús te kommen.
She will have none of that.	Dêr sil se neat fan hawwe.
That will make it difficult for me to help you.	Dat sil it dreech meitsje foar my om jo te helpen.
He doesn't exactly stop there.	Hy hâldt der net krekt by op.
I can not get enough of this song.	Ik kin net genôch krije fan dit liet.
His first book.	Syn earste boek.
I'm going to wake her up.	Ik gean har wekker meitsje.
We were just people.	Wy wiene mar minsken.
But she would not pay me to get her there.	Mar se soe my net betelje om har dêr te krijen.
Not your parents.	Net dyn âlden.
Help me find her.	Help my har te finen.
We need to be open.	Wy moatte iepen wêze.
She had bad days.	Se hie minne dagen.
But there is some truth.	Mar d'r is wat wierheid.
But that's not what's happening here.	Mar dat is net wat hjir bart.
She just looked at me.	Se seach my gewoan oan.
Just a friend of the family.	Krekt in freon fan 'e famylje.
It is not necessary to do.	It is net nedich om te dwaan.
Before that happens, you have things or you do not have things.	Foardat dat giet, hawwe jo dingen of jo hawwe gjin dingen.
But of course, she found it in him.	Mar fansels, se fûn it yn him.
Now he came back.	No kaam er werom.
There can be more than one way to do that.	D'r kin mear as ien manier wêze om dat te dwaan.
We ask for your help.	Wy freegje om jo help.
Make it one.	Meitsje it ien.
It can be whatever you want.	It kin wêze wat jo wolle.
That he knew how to do it.	Dat hy wist hoe't it moast.
Before they could come and ask us.	Foardat se komme koene en ús freegje.
The last died there.	De lêste stoar dêr .
This happens often.	Dit bart faak.
Things that stay with you.	Dingen dy't by dy bliuwe.
He could not himself these days.	Hy koe himsels dizze dagen net.
Could not believe he could see.	Koe net leauwe dat er sjen koe.
You have to be careful.	Jo moatte foarsichtich wêze.
It works really well.	It wurket echt goed.
Still don't get it.	Noch altyd net krije it.
His friends often talk about him.	Syn freonen prate faak oer him.
He needed a wife.	Hy hie in frou nedich.
I once had so many.	Ik hie ien kear safolle.
It was from nobody and everyone.	It wie fan nimmen en elkenien.
But maybe not.	Mar miskien net.
She had heard nothing from me.	Se hie neat fan my heard.
We will not stay.	Wy sille net bliuwe.
They just are not fun.	Se binne gewoan net leuk.
I do not even want to see you clearly.	Ik wol dy net iens dúdlik sjen.
Two it was different.	Twa wie it oars.
I looked at the house.	Ik seach nei it hûs.
I do not know what to say or do to you.	Ik wit net wat ik dy sizze of dwaan moat.
Not us, not me.	Net wy, net ik.
It does not.	Dat docht it net.
You do it much better.	Jo dogge it folle better.
If you can try it, you should.	As jo ​​​​it kinne besykje, moatte jo.
It is done as it is done.	It wurdt dien as it dien wurdt.
We do not love each other.	Wy hâlde net fan elkoar.
Just in saying his name.	Krekt yn it sizzen fan syn namme.
But it is.	Mar it is.
He was tired from work.	Hy wie wurch fan it wurk.
Or it's just me.	Of it is gewoan ik.
Then he stands over me.	Dan stiet er oer my hinne.
But the same problem occurs.	Mar itselde probleem komt foar.
Go to your place.	Gean nei jo plak.
You can actually get more than that.	Jo kinne eins mear krije dan dat.
She said she had nothing.	Se sei dat se neat hie.
People are happy here.	Minsken binne hjir bliid.
A first of his.	In earste fan him.
It worked well.	It wurke goed.
I just want you to know.	Ik wol gewoan dat jo witte.
He would soon be back on the bike.	Hy soe gau wer op 'e fyts.
And it is this.	En it is dit.
I love this job.	Ik hâld fan dizze baan.
And a friend.	En in freon.
The first word.	It earste wurd.
People stop talking.	Minsken hâlde op mei praten.
Family for many.	Famylje foar in protte.
My father did nothing wrong.	Myn heit hat neat ferkeard dien.
Was he.	Wie hy.
I thought something would make you angry.	Ik tocht wat datsto lilk wêze soe.
I need to see something.	Ik moat wat sjen.
The latter was different.	Dizze lêste wie oars.
I want to love someone.	Ik wol fan immen hâlde.
I had to make.	Ik moast meitsje.
Please include this in all questions.	Nim dit asjebleaft op yn alle fragen.
Over and under.	Oer en ûnder.
Another photo, that was.	Noch in foto, dat wie.
But, there seems to be a problem.	Mar, d'r liket in probleem te wêzen.
This book is old.	Dit boek is âld.
In fact, they did not know it.	Eins wisten se it net.
Not everything is about him.	Net alles giet oer him.
But you're a busy man.	Mar do bist in drok man.
It's what all parents want.	It is wat alle âlden wolle.
Not of the thing itself.	Net fan it ding sels.
It looks like we can win it.	It liket derop dat wy it winne kinne.
I came home late again.	Ik kaam wer let thús.
He took it off.	Hy naam it ôf.
Give them some time.	Jou se in bytsje tiid.
I started to get a little hurt.	Ik begûn in bytsje sear te wurden.
The old woman was old.	De âld frou wie âld.
You will be happy.	Jo sille bliid wêze.
It did me a lot of good.	It die my in protte goed.
Still no one around.	Noch altyd gjinien om.
They would probably say we did a good job.	Se soene wierskynlik sizze dat wy goed wurk dien hawwe.
We will see about this year.	Wy sille sjen oer dit jier.
He knew this day would come.	Hy wist dat dizze dei komme soe.
And this my friends, is what you want.	En dit myn freonen, is wat jo wolle.
They could not tell her much about him.	Se koene har net folle oer him fertelle.
She loves her hair.	Se hâlde fan har hier.
I did not have to go away and do what they did.	Ik hoegde net fuort te gean en te dwaan wat se diene.
They said they liked us.	Se seine dat se ús graach.
Did that pretty early.	Die dat frij betiid.
Just a father.	Krekt in heit.
Let me.	Lit my.
He looked at his wife.	Hy seach nei syn frou.
He was never heard from again.	Der waard nea wer fan him heard.
A little over a year ago.	In bytsje mear as in jier lyn.
You have to help me.	Jo moatte my helpe.
That, of course, went well.	Dat gie fansels goed.
You love people.	Jo hâlde fan minsken.
My husband works.	Myn man wurket.
Long, long line.	Lang, lang lyn.
But it never makes a problem.	Mar it makket nea in probleem.
It's not good a party.	It is net goed in feest.
They seemed to me just like they should be a couple.	Se like my krekt as moatte se in pear wêze.
Tell them they're doing a good job.	Fertel har dat se in goed wurk dogge.
He said it could help.	Hy sei dat it koe helpe.
I tried it once.	Ik besocht it ien kear.
That's what I'll give it.	Dat sil ik it jaan.
Of course not!	Fansels net!
Someone left it here.	Immen liet it hjir.
I do not know if we should help him.	Ik wit net oft wy him helpe moatte.
He does not have to say bad words.	Hy hoecht gjin minne wurden te sizzen.
We can help each other.	Wy kinne elkoar helpe.
This is not a good movie.	Dit is gjin goede film.
They are very real.	Se binne hiel echt.
They were already gone.	Se wiene al fuort.
He comes for me.	Hy komt foar my.
Not the day.	Net de dei.
It's just been too long.	It hat gewoan te lang west.
I could not take it anymore.	Ik koe it net mear.
He had enough time.	Hy hie genôch tiid.
But three it was.	Mar trije wie it.
We will not give you the money.	Wy sille jo it jild net jaan.
It's beautiful here.	It is hjir moai.
I hope they stay there.	Ik hoopje dat se der by bliuwe.
There we can go through and through.	Dêr kinne wy ​​troch en troch.
It was a ready, still alive.	It wie in ree, noch yn libben.
Do the right thing and good things will happen.	Doch it goede ding en goede dingen barre.
I came away.	Ik kaam fuort.
I'm just finished reading that book.	Ik bin krekt klear mei it lêzen fan dat boek.
You're hard.	Do bist hurd.
I thought about this.	Ik tocht oer dit.
But she is who she is.	Mar se is wa't se is.
So you would put your name.	Sa soene jo jo namme sette.
I hope you do much better.	Ik hoopje dat dy folle better giet.
But they were too late.	Mar se wiene te let.
He knew nothing else.	Hy koe neat oars.
Would not say a word.	Soe gjin wurd sizze.
All people do this.	Alle minsken dogge dit.
Feel your way around.	Fiel jo wei om.
But maybe he did not need them both.	Mar miskien hie er se beide net nedich.
Just try and move on.	Besykje gewoan en gean troch.
But not too busy.	Mar net te drok.
Everyone knew well.	Elkenien wist wol.
So far, it works.	Oant no ta wurket it.
I have never seen this before in my life.	Ik haw dit noch noait earder yn myn libben sjoen.
He has heard this before.	Hy hat dizze earder heard.
Don’t worry, it happens to everyone.	Sit gjin soargen, it bart mei elkenien.
People could not do their job.	Minsken koene har wurk net dwaan.
It hurt.	It die sear.
You have to find them.	Jo moatte se fine.
I quickly looked back.	Ik seach gau werom.
Is he talking about you?	Hat hy it oer dy?
Just the first one.	Krekt de earste.
to as be.	oan as wêze.
If he's surprised, he does not show it.	As er ferrast is, lit er it net sjen.
You have to ask for it.	Jo moatte der om freegje.
She never really did.	Se hat noait echt dien.
He had to come.	Hy moast komme.
I was not talking to you.	Ik wie net tsjin dy te praten.
But again, we are not here to take anything from anyone.	Mar wer, wy binne hjir net om wat fan ien te nimmen.
You're the first here.	Do bist hjir de earste.
We had enough.	Wy hiene genôch.
Not that he could do anything about it.	Net dat er der wat oan dwaan koe.
But you will not find it in this life.	Mar jo sille it net fine yn dit libben.
But look at them.	Mar sjoch se.
But that was not him at all.	Mar dat wie hy net hielendal.
We can leave her here better and give her time.	Wy kinne har hjir better litte en har tiid jaan.
Just visit me.	Besykje my mar.
It would be nice.	It soe moai wêze.
Enough of that.	Genôch fan dat.
And let me go.	En lit my gean.
It must be such a thing.	It moat sa'n ding wêze.
That we are not ready, whatever anyone says.	Dat wy binne net klear, wat immen ek seit.
It's just there forever.	It is der gewoan foar altyd.
He can do whatever he wants.	Hy kin dwaan wat er wol.
We take what we can.	Wy nimme wat wy kinne.
I could not think of it.	Ik koe der net oan tinke.
Neither of us was sure what to say.	Net ien fan ús wie wis wat te sizzen.
So we go.	Sa geane wy.
That's the way it is of course.	Dat is de manier fan it fansels.
They will be there anyway.	Se sille der wol wêze.
Maybe he should go back home.	Miskien moat er werom nei hûs.
And come careful.	En kom foarsichtich.
There may be one long before that.	D'r kin ien lang foardat dat.
The food was good.	It iten wie goed.
The police will have to find her.	De plysje sil har fine moatte.
But we will not try to get out.	Mar wy sille net besykje út te kommen.
It can not be true.	It kin net wier wêze.
We want more of it.	Wy wolle der mear fan hawwe.
It's good if you can not be friends with everyone.	It is goed as jo net mei elkenien freonen kinne wêze.
She said she had never told anyone.	Se sei dat se it noait oan ien ferteld hie.
I do not really know how to do this.	Ik wit net echt hoe't ik dit dwaan moat.
I do not know, not be one.	Ik wit it net, net ien wêze.
He does nothing for me.	Hy docht neat foar my.
Then let them take care of things.	Lit se dan foar de dingen soargje.
He could not stay here long.	Hy koe hjir net lang bliuwe.
Give her nothing.	Jou har neat.
They may have done.	Se kinne hawwe dien.
He just did not want me.	Hy woe my net.
Not with him, that's for sure.	Net mei him, dat is wis.
We do it every day.	Wy dogge it alle dagen.
It's up to you.	It is oan dy.
Touch him next time but be careful.	Gean him de folgjende kear mar foarsichtich oan.
It seemed pretty likely.	It like wis wierskynlik.
We can not go tonight, or tomorrow.	Wy kinne net gean fannacht, of moarn.
Will probably be back to get more.	Sil wierskynlik werom wêze om mear te krijen.
Wait until everyone is gone.	Wachtsje oant elkenien fuort is.
We will buy what we need in the city.	Wy sille keapje wat wy nedich hawwe yn 'e stêd.
But they could know it.	Mar se koene it witte.
We want such a man.	Wy wolle sa'n man.
You would not believe it.	Jo soene net leauwe.
His wife could not pay.	Syn frou koe net betelje.
My life is ready.	Myn libben is klear.
Is it that good.	Is dit sa goed.
Maybe she would need to, maybe not.	Miskien soe se nedich wêze, miskien net.
I'll buy that.	Ik sil dat keapje.
She was angry.	Se wie lilk.
Still, it was early.	Noch altyd wie it betiid.
Will you help us?	Sille jo ús helpe?
He thought he was in bed.	Hy tocht dat er op bêd wie.
From the next day.	Fan de folgjende dei.
Hope that thing makes it come here soon.	Hoopje dat ding makket dat it hjir gau komt.
They come with the water.	Se komme mei it wetter.
And if there is nothing, then it is good.	En as der neat is, dan is it goed.
Do not talk about them.	Praat net fan har.
We do not want more.	Wy wolle net mear.
I know you can not see everything.	Ik wit dat jo net alles sjen kinne.
And that can not.	En dat kin net.
Make things happen.	Meitsje dingen barre.
I had no idea he would be here.	Ik hie gjin idee dat hy hjir wêze soe.
And it did not matter.	En it makke neat út.
One more day.	Noch ien dei.
They do not have to look.	Se hoege net te sjen.
Just show.	Gewoan sjen litte.
It's not as difficult as it should be.	It is net sa dreech as it moat wêze.
There must be a problem.	Der moat in probleem wêze.
Also, he makes it too easy.	Ek makket er it te maklik.
This has always been a problem.	Dit hat altyd in probleem west.
This was not home.	Dit wie net thús.
We would have heard sooner now than he had.	Wy soene no earder heard hawwe as hy hie.
A little too good.	In bytsje te goed.
He did not want to but he had to.	Hy woe net mar hy moast.
So was my hair.	Sa wie myn hier.
Never his thoughts on where he was.	Nea syn gedachten oer wêr't hy wie.
First my mother, now you.	Earst myn mem, no do.
He worried about what would happen next.	Hy makke him soargen oer wat der dan barre soe.
When a woman talks, it should be about a man.	As in frou praat, moat it oer in man gean.
Even that was not certain.	Ek dat wie net wis.
I hope someone can help.	Ik hoopje dat immen kin helpe.
I made sure of that.	Ik makke der wis fan.
Take me back.	Nim my mar werom.
He wondered if it was all true.	Hy frege him ôf oft it allegear wier wie.
What fun.	Wat leuk.
But maybe she did.	Mar miskien hat se it dien.
He had none of this.	Hy hie hjir neat fan.
It is our only hope.	It is ús ienige hope.
It was hard work, and someone had to take it.	It wie hurd wurk, en immen moast it nimme.
There we must be.	Dêr moatte wy wêze.
Now comes a new movie.	No komt der in nije film.
They did what not many people can do.	Se diene wat net folle minsken kinne dwaan.
We are human beings.	Wy binne minsken.
She was my best friend.	Se wie myn bêste freon.
They love the guy.	Se hâlde fan de keardel.
That's exactly what it is.	Dat is krekt wat it is.
Seeing was like looking at something in him.	It sjen wie as sjen nei wat yn him.
Anyone can get one of them.	Elkenien kin ien fan har krije.
I got a lot of it back home, even from my family.	Ik krige der in protte fan werom thús, sels fan myn famylje.
I have not tried it.	Ik ha it net besocht.
Try to see it for what it is.	Besykje it te sjen foar wat it is.
The time is almost over.	De tiid sa hast om.
I heard that too.	Dat hearde ik ek.
I think it will help with the meeting.	Ik tink dat it sil helpe mei de gearkomste.
Maybe he was wanting that.	Miskien wie er dat wol.
You are that person.	Do bist dy persoan.
About you and me.	Oer dy en my.
He had never felt anything before.	Hy fielde noch noait wat.
So we talked.	Sa hawwe wy praat.
Okay, then go to bed.	Goed, gean dan op bêd.
It may be true.	It kin wier wêze.
And it will.	En it sil.
Maybe it was even true.	Miskien wie it sels wier.
I can not believe he's doing this to you.	Ik kin it net leauwe dat er dit mei dy docht.
And it works.	En it wurket.
Buy a little more time.	Keapje in bytsje mear tiid.
I had a house there.	Ik hie dêr in hûs.
He tried to say something but could not speak.	Hy besocht wat te sizzen, mar koe net prate.
I wanted my life back.	Ik woe myn libben werom.
Without it, something we do not have is so clear.	Sûnder it is wat wy hawwe net sa dúdlik.
She found the house easily.	Se fûn it hûs maklik.
It is not out of the question.	It is net út 'e fraach.
There was something off.	Der wie wat ôf.
The boy seemed tired.	De jonge like wurch.
and you can find them easily enough.	en jo kinne fine se maklik genôch.
I do not want to see anyone.	Ik wol gjinien sjen.
This is how it should work.	Sa moat it wurkje.
They worked for both.	Se wurke foar beide.
I never took it off.	Ik naam it noait ôf.
Could not pay for it even if.	Koe net betelje foar it sels as.
You can also just do it wrong.	Jo kinne it ek gewoan ferkeard dwaan.
That was the other man.	Dat wie de oare man.
I can not win with him.	Ik kin net mei him winne.
They can be your friends.	Se kinne jo freonen wêze.
Let me talk.	Lit my prate.
See you this new week !.	Sjoch dy nije wike!.
It was like being a child again.	It wie as wer in bern.
He does come to life.	Hy komt wol ta libben.
They need to know you.	Se moatte jo witte.
To get better.	Om better te wurden.
I do not do it often, but it has happened.	Ik doch it net faak, mar it is bard.
And now, one more thing before you go.	En no, noch ien ding foardat jo gean.
There is good reason.	Der is goede reden.
I will not tell you anything about it.	Ik sil jo der neat oer fertelle.
He should never have tried his plan.	Hy hie syn plan noait moatten besykje.
Better maybe if they had.	Better miskien as se hiene.
She now knew nothing of her life.	Se wist no neat fan har libben.
This will be your room.	Dit sil jo keamer wêze.
Everyone knows how much we love it here.	Elkenien wit hoefolle wy it hjir hâlde.
She took her time.	Se naam har tiid.
My mom is very busy now.	Myn mem hat it no tige drok.
But there was no time for that.	Mar dêr wie gjin tiid foar.
I hope it was good for you too.	Ik hoopje dat it foar dy ek goed wie.
She woke him up.	Se makke him wekker.
He seemed to get angry in a different way.	Hy like op in oare manier lilk te wurden.
I think they have tried, maybe even tried hard.	Ik tink dat se besocht hawwe, miskien sels hurd besocht.
We had no water.	Wy hiene gjin wetter.
Anyway, that's the job.	Hoe dan ek, dat is it wurk.
I made it just in time.	Ik makke it krekt op 'e tiid.
That is very good for that.	Dat is dêr tige goed foar.
I know you were just a good friend.	Ik wit dat jo gewoan in goede freon wiene.
I would be better off now.	Ik soe no better gean.
The new year had begun.	It nije jier wie begûn.
Other than that, it was just another day.	Oars as dat wie it gewoan in oare dei.
But we are not doing that for a long time.	Mar dat dogge wy noch lang net.
That you do not have to do to me.	Dat jo hoege jo net om my te dwaan.
I'll make us something.	Ik sil ús wat meitsje.
I have always liked her.	Ik haw har altyd leuk fûn.
I know you'm scared.	Ik wit datst bang bist.
I have to make sure everything is fine.	Ik moat soargje dat alles goed is.
I could not see well.	Ik koe net goed sjen.
She wanted away from him.	Se woe fan him ôf.
My hair is so long!	Myn hier is sa lang!
He was a handsome man.	Hy wie in moai man.
Only, there are two of you.	Allinnich, d'r binne twa fan jo.
I'm still getting over it.	Ik kom der noch oer.
He took my hand.	Hy naam myn hân.
He found very few.	Hy fûn hiel pear.
What you need to do is.	Wat jo moatte dwaan is.
Just to make that clear to everyone.	Krekt om dat foar elkenien dúdlik te meitsjen.
Different, but one and the same.	Oars, mar ien en itselde.
Now there was no going back.	No wie der gjin mear werom.
I have not done well here.	Ik haw hjir gjin goed dien.
They have not been seen since.	Se binne sûnt net sjoen.
But it could be anyone.	Mar it koe elkenien wêze.
I just want you around.	Ik wol dy gewoan om.
That he would do.	Dat soe er dwaan.
I need to do more.	Ik moat mear dwaan.
We knew who we were.	Wy wisten wa't wy wiene.
He always seems to be sick.	Hy liket altyd siik te wêzen.
I was not here, last year.	Ik wie hjir net, ferline jier.
I was just like that.	Ik wie krekt sa.
One of us will try it.	Ien fan ús sil it besykje.
I assume we disagree here.	Ik nim oan dat wy it hjir net oer iens binne.
I wondered what she really said.	Ik frege my ôf wat se echt sei.
It's just a girl.	It is mar in famke.
I did not know the child.	Ik koe it bern net.
Or never seemed to come out.	Of like noait út te kommen.
But you go.	Mar jo geane.
I'm sick of it.	Ik bin der siik fan.
I do not know what they are.	Ik wit net wat se binne.
They want to do it right, they want to.	Se wolle it goed dwaan, se wolle graach.
She showed it so easily.	Se liet it sa maklik sjen.
I'm just one more.	Ik bin noch mar ien.
I could not believe it.	Dat koe ik net leauwe.
Neither did he.	Dat hie er ek net.
But they are no longer there.	Mar se binne der net mear.
They're coming back.	Se komme werom.
More likely, actually.	Mear wierskynlik, eins.
He said well.	Hy sei goed.
She seemed away.	Se like fuort.
Together with mine.	Tegearre mei myn.
It is very clear.	It is hiel dúdlik.
I know nothing of this.	Ik wit hjir neat fan.
And he told me he would look into it.	En hy fertelde my dat hy der nei sjen soe.
All we can do is hope.	Alles wat wy kinne dwaan is hoopje.
But that stops, long ago.	Mar dat hâldt op, lang lyn.
He is obviously too old for her.	Hy is har fansels te âld.
They had a guy take me out to my car.	Se hiene in keardel my út nei myn auto.
That does not matter.	Dat makket neat út.
He makes you get at two and three.	Hy makket dat jo op twa en trije komme.
I'll be going home too.	Ik sil ek nei hûs.
You want to love me, maybe.	Jo wolle fan my hâlde, miskien.
Where are we going with this ?.	Wêr geane wy ​​mei dit hinne?.
On the water.	Op it wetter.
He does not come up.	Hy komt net op.
I've never seen that before.	Dat haw ik noch noait earder sjoen.
We have to win these.	Wy moatte dizze winne.
He just does not know.	Hy wit it gewoan net.
She should be back tomorrow.	Se soe moarn werom wêze moatte.
And no one ever saw that.	En nimmen seach dat ea.
It was not that she wanted him anymore, she did not want that.	It wie net dat se him mear woe, dat woe se net.
I clearly did not do it for the money.	Ik ha it dúdlik net dien foar it jild.
When he saw my father.	Doe't er myn heit seach.
You're sick.	Do bist siik.
We do not really know what happened.	Wy witte net echt wat der bard is.
I do not think she did it.	Ik tink net dat se it dien hat.
He did not see the new movie last week.	Hy seach de nije film ferline wike net.
The man no one really knows.	De man dy't nimmen echt wit.
There is a lot to do.	Der is in protte te dwaan.
We want to make the same thing easy for you.	Wy wolle itselde ding maklik foar jo meitsje.
Will never came to my office.	Sil kaam noait nei myn kantoar.
You will find something.	Jo sille wat fine.
I want to know one of them.	Dêr wol ik ien fan witte.
They are really worried.	Se binne echt soargen.
I kept talking.	Ik bleau praten.
I'm not out.	Ik net út.
It went after everything.	It gie nei alles.
But other people will.	Mar oare minsken sille.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Wy kinne neat mei har dwaan.
They say they do not.	Se sizze dat se net dogge.
So she walked home.	Sa rûn se nei hûs.
There was a bit.	Dêr wie in bytsje.
He had three children.	Hy hie trije bern.
We're still going.	Wy geane noch.
And work hard, and are expected to do a good job.	En hurd wurkje, en wurdt ferwachte dat se in goede baan dwaan.
It was almost unnecessary.	It wie hast net nedich.
Your life is busy.	Jo libben is drok.
My friend is in a better place now.	Myn freon is no op in better plak.
And the girl.	En it famke.
I did not hear what she asked, but it does not matter.	Ik hearde net wat se frege, mar it makket neat út.
But she was just and she was not.	Mar se wie net en se die net.
He had done so much.	Hy hie safolle dien.
You have no time.	Jo hawwe gjin tiid.
And stayed for more than two hours.	En bleau foar mear as twa oeren.
But it's just that.	Mar it is krekt dat.
As much as you want.	Safolle as jo wolle.
She never has and never will.	Se hat noait en sil nea.
And she was easy to see.	En se wie maklik om te sjen.
That's true enough.	Dat is wier genôch.
We let it happen.	Wy litte it barre.
I had a good evening which was beautiful.	Ik hie in goede jûn dy't moai wie.
What city are you from?	Fan hokker stêd komme jo?
Living with her father.	Wenne by har heit.
He never went out of his way to make friends.	Hy gie noait út syn wei om freonen te meitsjen.
Here's what you need to do.	Hjir is wat jo dwaan moatte.
If it works for you, then it works.	As it foar jo wurket, dan wurket it.
I will try to be there early.	Ik sil besykje der betiid te wêzen.
I'm not old yet.	Ik bin noch net âld.
You really need to be aware of that.	Dêr moatte jo wier oan wêze.
He was as little as the first.	Hy wie sa'n bytsje as de earste.
Here is your new home.	Hjir is dyn nije hûs.
I saw what happened.	Ik seach wat der barde.
But we need you.	Mar wy hawwe dy nedich.
Been the last few days.	De lêste pear dagen west.
Did not run here.	Net rûn hjir.
That's all.	Dit is alles.
You'll be back in that bed.	Jo komme werom yn dat bêd.
They were not sure they were ready.	Se wiene der net wis fan dat se klear wiene.
I wish it had been better.	Ik woe dat it better west hie.
He also had something with him.	Hy hie ek wat by him.
Same with the without.	Krekt sa mei de sûnder.
I hope you get enough.	Ik hoopje dat jo genôch krije.
He did not bother me so much.	Hy makke my net safolle út.
You will be free to go.	Jo sille frij wêze om te gean.
Have you seen that!	Hast dat sjoen!
Please try again.	Besykje asjebleaft.
His life, our life.	Syn libben, ús libben.
Not for nothing.	Net foar neat.
Whatever she wanted, he would give her.	Wat se woe, hy soe har jaan.
I'm not the child.	Ik bin it bern net.
Of course, they would never tell us that.	Dat soene se ús fansels noait fertelle.
But that would take time and money.	Mar dat soe tiid en jild nimme.
I love the work.	Ik hâld fan it wurk.
We are a different family.	Wy binne in oare famylje.
Two is good, one is better.	Twa is goed, ien is better.
There have been many since.	Der binne sûnt in protte west.
He looked back at the woman.	Hy seach werom nei de frou.
Her hair came out nicely.	Har hier kaam der moai út.
What are you trying to tell me?	Wat besykje jo my te fertellen?
They proceed with caution.	Se geane foarsichtich troch.
That child is beautiful.	Dat bern is moai.
I'm so there again.	Ik bin der sa wer.
I did not tell her otherwise.	Ik sei har net oars.
You've done this before.	Dat hawwe jo earder dien.
He will tell you the same thing.	Hy sil dy itselde sizze.
There's so much you do not know.	Der is noch safolle dat jo net witte.
That does not leave us much time.	Dat lit ús net folle tiid oer.
Her room looked so different from his room.	Har keamer seach der sa oars út as syn keamer.
Very much so.	Hiel folle sa.
Please make it a good one.	Meitsje it asjebleaft in goed wêzen.
I wonder how long it has been there.	Ik freegje my ôf hoe lang it der al west hat.
I wonder if they will ever visit us.	Ik freegje my ôf oft se ús oait besykje sille.
I do not know where he may be.	Ik wit net wêr't er wêze kin.
Please do not talk to me, now.	Praat asjebleaft net mei my, no.
He had never seen such a girl as her.	Hy hie noch noait sa'n famke sjoen as har.
He was now a free man.	Hy wie no in frij man.
But it is not there yet.	Mar it is der noch net.
You know, it does not have to be that way.	Jo witte, it hoecht net sa te wêzen.
So it seems, she said.	Sa liket it, sei se.
Her house was gone.	Har hûs wie fuort.
Or he thought he had it.	Of hy tocht dat er it hie.
Well, maybe school.	No, miskien skoalle.
I'm glad we're playing away first.	Ik bin bliid dat wy earst fuort spylje.
She would do what needed to be done for her family.	Se soe dwaan wat der dien wurde moast foar har famylje.
He could not think of that now.	Dêr koe er no net oan tinke.
Well, there it is.	No, dêr is it.
I need the job.	Ik haw de baan nedich.
I knew it.	Ik wist it.
Go away!	Gean fuort!
I never regret talking.	Ik ha noait spyt dat ik praat.
I'm not different.	Ik bin net oars.
When you come.	As jo ​​komme.
But, did not work.	Mar, wurke net.
I still do not.	Ik noch altyd net.
Now she knows better.	No wit se better.
Then again, they might not.	Dan wer, se miskien net.
None of this is certain.	Gjin fan dit is wis.
I think it will be soon.	Ik tink dat it gau sil wêze.
We have one person in that house.	Wy hawwe ien persoan yn dat hûs.
Everything in me hurt.	Alles yn my die sear.
They go on all the time.	Se geane de hiele tiid troch.
I've been there before.	Ik haw der earder west.
Do not know what happened to me.	Wit net wat der mei my bard is.
Been there since day one.	Dêr west sûnt dei ien.
You did very well.	Jo hawwe it tige goed dien.
Nor of anything in life.	Ek net fan neat yn it libben.
They would talk about that too.	Dêr soene se ek oer prate.
Do not look at the room.	Sjoch net nei de keamer.
Think about how long that is.	Tink oer hoe lang dat is.
Or maybe it was just me.	Of miskien wie it gewoan ik.
We are not.	Wy binne net.
No one could see him, but neither could anyone.	Nimmen koe him sjen, mar ek net ien.
Maybe she's here.	Miskien is se hjir.
But she did not know why.	Mar se wist net wêrom.
He had hoped for one.	Hy hie op ien hope.
And here it is.	En hjir is it.
You really know how hurt a guy is.	Jo echt witte hoe't sear in keardel.
There may be a new one out.	Der kin in nije út wêze.
Not much time.	Net folle tiid.
No idea what I'm doing wrong, please help.	Gjin idee wat ik ferkeard doch, help asjebleaft.
But something came into her.	Mar der kaam wat yn har yn.
Of course something had to happen.	Der moast fansels wat barre.
But you will have to try.	Mar jo sille moatte besykje.
They needed help.	Se hiene help nedich.
You're sick.	Do bist siik.
He left water in the bowl.	Hy liet wetter yn 'e kom.
One day a young man does.	Op in dei docht in jonge man.
He was tired, so tired.	Hy wie wurch, sa wurch.
Maybe there's no way they should.	Miskien is d'r gjin manier dat se moatte.
That worked out very well for me.	Dat hat my tige goed wurke.
They have not been here yet.	Se binne hjir noch net west.
This is actually not a good idea.	Dit is eins gjin goed idee.
It told me absolutely nothing.	It sei my hielendal neat.
She wanted to go home, but she was afraid of her friend.	Se woe nei hûs, mar se wie bang foar har freon.
I'm glad you agree.	Ik bin bliid dat jo it iens binne.
I looked at her.	Ik seach nei har.
It's there or it's not.	It is der of it is net.
That will not work.	Dat sil net wurkje.
What's wrong with you? 	Wat is der mei dy?
he asked.	hy frege.
I had found a letter.	Ik hie in brief fûn.
He was not allowed to leave her there.	Hy mocht har dêr net litte.
So much for that.	Safolle foar dat.
It doesn't matter.	Docht er net ta.
I thought he would go.	Ik tocht dat er gean soe.
Even just knowing.	Sels mar witte.
He wanted to see his father.	Hy woe syn heit sjen.
We never met.	Wy hawwe ús noait moete.
Mine and yours.	Myn en dyn.
I'm not talking to her.	Ik praat net mei har.
We have to go.	Wy moatte fuort.
He does not matter.	Hy makket neat út.
We think this way.	Wy tinke op dizze manier.
That's what we're here for.	Dêr binne wy ​​hjir foar.
I should never have said that to you.	Dat hie ik noait tsjin dy sizze moatten.
Of course, they are good at it.	Fansels binne se der goed yn.
If you can find a seat, take it.	As jo ​​​​in sit fine kinne, nim it dan.
We need to find another way.	Wy moatte in oare manier fine.
She's been here, but not for long.	Se is hjir, mar net foar lang.
I know that now.	Dat wit ik no.
They will pay.	Se sille betelje.
I've seen her a few times in town.	Ik haw har in pear kear yn 'e stêd sjoen.
I could not do wrong.	Ik koe gjin ferkeard dwaan.
At the police will.	By de plysje wol.
He does not make it easy.	Hy makket it net maklik.
He knew nothing.	Hy wist neat.
I let things happen.	Ik lit dingen barre.
There's one here.	Der is hjir ien.
She's over the water.	Se is oer it wetter.
This was not allowed.	Dit mocht net.
I'll give you a life.	Ik sil jo in libben jaan.
Have you ever been to this room before?	Ha jo oait earder yn dizze keamer west?
He always says that.	Dat seit er altyd.
He needed me.	Hy hie my nedich.
That's too often.	Dat die se te faak.
Maybe it would not.	Miskien soe it net.
We are happy to help you.	Wy helpe jo graach.
Which is very nice.	Wat is hiel moai.
Nothing does nothing.	Neat docht neat.
It’s about talking to people.	It giet om praten mei minsken.
Now they were back, and we knew what it would be like.	No wiene se werom, en wy wisten hoe't it wêze soe.
Of course, of course.	Fansels, fansels.
You may not be able to.	Jo kinne miskien net kinne.
Please do not take me away from my family.	Nim my asjebleaft net fan myn famylje ôf.
He should know it.	Hy soe it witte moatte.
She did not want him to go.	Se woe net dat er gie.
I do not even have a place to stay.	Ik haw net iens in plak om te bliuwen.
I just want to win.	Ik wol gewoan winne.
I would love to see what you do then.	Ik soe graach sjen wat jo dan dogge.
Hope you come back soon !.	Hoopje dat jo gau werom komme!.
Someone had to.	Immen moast.
That's not for a few days.	Dat is net foar in pear dagen.
Think about how to do it right.	Tink oer hoe't jo it goed dwaan.
But it doesn't matter anymore.	Mar it hoecht sa net mear.
Below.	Hjir ûnder.
I wanted to see her.	Ik woe har sjen.
I'm glad we met you.	Ik bin bliid dat wy dy moete.
Nobody does that anymore.	Nimmen docht dat mear.
That's what she thought.	Dat tocht se.
It can not be good if we want children.	It kin net goed wêze as wy bern ha wolle.
It may not be true for you.	It kin net wier wêze foar jo.
It's pretty easy.	It is frij maklik.
I even got there.	Ik bin der sels by kommen.
Maybe next year.	Miskien takom jier.
They did not even know what they were doing.	Se wisten net iens wat se diene.
None of.	Gjin fan.
That I had to give her.	Dat moast ik har jaan.
I have not thought about it more than that.	Ik haw der net mear yn tocht as dat.
But there is no reason for me to participate in this.	Mar d'r is gjin reden foar my om mei te dwaan oan dizze.
Not many people know that.	Net folle minsken witte dat.
He wanted a better life for himself.	Hy woe in better libben foar himsels.
He's in there.	Hy is der yn.
It has kept it that way.	It hat sa hâlden.
I'm tired and too busy.	Ik bin wurch en te drok.
But we know we have life.	Mar wy witte dat wy it libben hawwe.
I'm not happy if you ask that.	Ik bin net bliid, as jo dat freegje.
I actually saw it twice.	Ik seach it eins twa kear.
It seems like they do everything in the right way.	It liket derop dat se alles op 'e goede manier dogge.
There is no one else who needs us.	D'r is gjinien oars dy't ús nedich hat.
Take it off.	Nim it ôf.
You can try it though.	Jo kinne it wol besykje.
Wants too long.	Wol te lang.
I look forward to seeing it !.	Ik sjoch der nei út om it te sjen!.
The words come to life.	De wurden komme ta libben.
Well, here you are.	No, hjir binne jo.
She had even looked into it.	Se hie der sels nei sjoen.
I thought that would work.	Ik tocht dat dat soe wurkje.
New friends made at school.	Nije freonen makke op skoalle.
I know it so well.	Ik wit it sa goed.
They may need it.	Se kinne it nedich hawwe.
And she was sure.	En se wie wis.
She felt sick.	Se fielde har siik.
We want to say our sayings.	Wy wolle ús sizzen sizze.
I've never seen them before.	Ik haw se nea earder sjoen.
But they are.	Mar se binne.
Is not out yet.	Is noch net út.
And it could be anything.	En it koe fan alles wêze.
I'm not sure, really.	Ik bin der net wis fan, echt.
I thought we were friends.	Ik tocht dat wy freonen wiene.
And then that.	En dan dat.
I did not ask for this.	Ik haw hjir net om frege.
That's what he wanted.	Dat woe er wol.
She was clearly worried.	Se wie dúdlik soargen.
The question is what can be done.	De fraach is wat kin dien wurde.
That happened over and over again.	Dat barde oer en wer.
No one went to bed on time.	Nimmen gie op tiid op bêd.
I want the best for everyone '.	Ik wol it bêste foar elkenien'.
But anyway, they say that to us.	Mar hoe dan ek, dat sizze se tsjin ús.
he asked.	hy frege.
And that did not happen.	En dat barde net.
Play against the best.	Spylje tsjin de bêste.
Who knows you are with us.	Wa wit dat jo by ús binne.
Here is also something to see.	Hjir is ek wat te sjen.
I have not looked back since.	Ik haw sûnt net werom sjoen.
They talk back.	Se prate werom.
I'm just working.	Ik wurkje gewoan.
Everything will do.	Alles sil dwaan.
We love too much.	Wy hâlde te folle.
He asked for you.	Hy frege om dy.
We can do nothing.	Wy kinne neat dwaan.
Or maybe.	Of miskien.
They really want to do it.	Se wolle it echt dwaan.
Everyone seemed to be happy.	Elkenien like bliid te wêzen.
Still a lot to do.	Noch in protte te dwaan.
It felt like it was not his hand.	It fielde as wie it net syn hân.
Make it up if you have to.	Meitsje it op as jo moatte.
You're back.	Do bist werom.
I have not seen it before.	Ik haw it noch net earder sjoen.
She ran a hand through her hair.	Se rûn in hân troch it hier.
She looks at the boy sitting in front of her.	Se sjocht nei de jonge dy't foar har sit.
I wanted them to take you.	Ik woe dat se dy nimme.
You still have them.	Jo hawwe se noch.
But what has happened has happened.	Mar wat der bard is, is bard.
He comes from a large family.	Hy komt út in grutte famylje.
Maybe the letter is for me.	Miskien is de brief foar my.
That's just wrong.	Dat is gewoan ferkeard.
And we used to do that.	En dat diene wy ​​eartiids.
Totally in money.	Hielendal yn jild.
Had to look back.	Moast werom sjen.
Maybe that was the problem.	Miskien wie dat it probleem.
He will have been.	Hy sil west hawwe.
We're going to my house.	Wy geane nei myn hûs.
Or right now.	Of no krekt.
I thought they would go.	Ik tocht dat se gean soene.
They saw me.	Se hawwe my sjoen.
I do not see him happy.	Ik sjoch him net bliid.
Do you think you can eat like that ?.	Tinke jo dat jo sa ite kinne?.
I know what happened, and so do you.	Ik wit wat der bard is, en do ek.
You tell me why.	Jo fertel my wêrom.
That's what I saw.	Dat haw ik sjoen.
I don't know.	Ik wit it net.
Children are still home from school.	Bern binne noch thús fan skoalle.
That would have already happened.	Dat soe al bard wêze.
I hope it would be fun.	Ik hoopje dat it leuk wêze soe.
I will not do it.	Ik sil it net dwaan.
He was not home yet.	Hy wie noch net thús.
It can be very different.	It kin hiel oars.
The problem is the money.	It probleem is it jild.
We need to know what is in our food.	Wy moatte witte wat der yn ús iten sit.
Another reason is that it is not necessary.	In oare reden is dat it net nedich is.
You have done a lot of work today.	Jo hawwe hjoed in protte wurk dien.
Enough with.	Genôch mei.
But that's what's happening here.	Mar dat is wat hjir bart.
You too.	Do ek.
But she did not stop there.	Mar dêr bleau se net by.
I know everything.	Ik wit alles.
He would be the last man.	Hy soe de lêste man wêze.
I'm really doing this.	Ik doch dit echt.
And he went back to his family.	En hy gie werom nei syn famylje.
He did not look at them.	Hy seach se net oan.
Just my name.	Krekt myn namme.
I have now.	Ik haw no.
All this, and more.	Al dizze, en mear.
She can do better than that.	Se kin better as dat.
And she thought she had done her best.	En se tocht dat se har moai dien hie.
It just happened by itself.	It barde gewoan fan himsels.
With her.	Mei har.
They would have done that to other people, but not me.	Se soene hawwe dien dat oare minsken, mar net my.
He thought so.	Dat tocht er.
It did not serve them.	Dit diene se net.
It will be for the other.	It sil wêze foar de oare.
If she wants to do something, she does it.	As se wat dwaan wol docht se it.
Did not ask about me.	Hat net oer my frege.
Without each other it just does not work.	Sûnder elkoar giet it gewoan net.
It was so fun to read.	It wie sa leuk om te lêzen.
I just wish someone else knew.	Ik woe gewoan dat immen oars wist.
We were not worried.	Wy wiene gjin soargen.
A few people live here all year round.	In pear minsken wenje hjir it hiele jier troch.
She probably can 't handle it.	Se kin der wierskynlik net mei.
We are not what happens to us.	Wy binne net wat der mei ús bart.
But she gave it away.	Mar se joech it fuort.
What we were.	Wat wy wiene.
Well, let me ask you that.	No, lit my it dy dan sa freegje.
Here is.	Hier is.
Do this once, okay.	Doch dit ien kear, goed.
From before we met.	Fan foardat wy moete.
Everything was what and where and how and why, why, why.	Alles wie wat en wêr en hoe en wêrom, wêrom, wêrom.
But he was fine now, he said to himself again.	Mar hy wie no goed, sei er tsjin himsels wer.
We can be one of them.	Wy kinne ien fan har wêze.
I would love it.	Ik soe it leuk fine.
Probably best if they never met.	Wierskynlik bêste as se nea moete.
Hope you come back.	Hoopje dat jo werom komme.
We will never return.	Wy sille nea werom.
Do not know if that is good.	Wit net oft dat goed is.
We will always love each other.	Wy sille altyd fan elkoar hâlde.
I'm scared of the city.	Ik bin bang foar de stêd.
No one could say what they were for.	Nimmen koe sizze wêr't se der foar wiene.
It's not too late for us.	It is net te let foar ús.
Well, she thought.	No, tocht se.
But it is he.	Mar it is hy.
A man, a woman, a child.	In man, in frou, in bern.
That's not a problem.	Dat is gjin probleem.
There is no school in the city.	D'r is gjin skoalle yn 'e stêd.
I see nothing more that we can do now.	Ik sjoch neat mear dat wy no dwaan kinne.
How are you.	Hoe giet it mei dy.
Today was a very big day.	Hjoed wie in hiele grutte dei.
Better that than nothing.	Better dat as neat.
I was too surprised.	Ik wie te ferrast.
She took her time for it.	Se naam der har tiid foar.
Nobody knew what could be done.	Nimmen wist wat der dien wurde koe.
His mother encouraged him to come to work.	Syn mem joech him oan om oan it wurk te kommen.
So it was next year.	Sa wie it folgjende jier.
She can not do that.	Dat kin se net.
But not much was done.	Mar der waard net folle dien.
I can say nothing yet.	Ik kin noch neat sizze.
Monday is the first day of the week.	Moandei is de earste dei fan de wike.
I was just surprised he was in us.	Ik wie gewoan ferrast dat hy yn ús wie.
She had not said so much, and she never would.	Se hie net safolle sein, en soe se noait.
That would be like your father.	Dat soe wêze as dyn heit.
He was not.	Hy wier net.
We have a room here.	Wy hawwe hjir in keamer.
Not to me.	Net oan my.
You're my best friend.	Do bist myn bêste freon.
No food to eat.	Gjin iten te iten.
We'll be pretty busy.	Wy sille it aardich drok hawwe.
He is also your family.	Hy is ek dyn famylje.
I knew he knew that too.	Ik wist dat er dat ek wist.
No one could say what had happened.	Nimmen koe sizze wat der bard wie.
We have to go now.	Wy moatte no gean.
This is the life for this person so far.	Dit is it libben foar dizze persoan oant no ta.
And this would be.	En dit soe wêze.
It does not matter to him.	It makket him neat út.
The city ran from life.	De stêd rûn fan it libben.
He will not come.	Hy sil net komme.
This was why he was one of my favorite people.	Dit wie wêrom hy ien fan myn favorite minsken wie.
That can help.	Dat kin helpe.
I just do not know about that man.	Ik wit gewoan net fan dy man.
He just wanted to talk.	Hy woe net prate.
All of them have some truth to them.	Al dy hawwe wat wierheid oan har.
And so he came to me.	En sa kaam er by my.
What do you think.	Wat tinksto.
We stop talking.	Wy hâlde op mei praten.
I just do not know how to do it.	Ik wit gewoan net hoe't ik it dwaan moat.
What they did to me.	Wat se my dien hawwe.
I felt a little like that myself.	Ik fielde my sels in bytsje sa.
I walked to my house.	Ik rûn nei myn hûs.
Someone did that to me too.	Ien hat my dat ek dien.
They are the people who will have the good things.	Se binne de minsken dy't de goede dingen sille hawwe.
It should not happen this way.	It moat net barre op dizze manier.
That's all everyone ever sees.	Dat is alles wat elkenien ea sjocht.
I'm working really hard on this.	Ik wurkje hjir echt hurd oan.
I already bought it.	Ik haw it al kocht.
And there is not much to tell.	En der is net folle te fertellen.
Help me people, please.	Help my minsken, asjebleaft.
I did not like well where he went with his words.	Ik mocht net goed wêr't er mei syn wurden hinne gie.
Life would have been easy for me.	It libben soe foar my maklik west hawwe.
Of course it is one.	Fansels is it ien.
The family thought it would be good for him.	De famylje tocht dat it goed foar him wêze soe.
I just want you to help him.	Ik wol gewoan dat jo him helpe.
I'll tell you it's happening.	Ik sil dy sizze dat it bart.
So it was a very busy place.	Sa wie it in hiel drok plak.
We are not entirely good or bad.	Wy binne net hielendal goed of min.
Now let's get back to work and make it happen.	Litte wy no wer oan it wurk gean en it barre.
Come on, everyone.	Kom op, elkenien.
He just wanted to go the guy.	Hy woe gewoan de keardel gean.
What that would be, she had no idea.	Wat dat wêze soe, hie se gjin idee.
We just put it on, put it on.	Wy sette it gewoan op, sette it oan.
They will do anything for money.	Se sille alles dwaan foar jild.
We have to make it happen.	Wy moatte it barre.
That's how it should be.	Sa moat it wêze.
Come back soon, we need you.	Kom gau werom, wy hawwe dy nedich.
I'm not ready to talk to you yet.	Ik bin noch net ree om mei dy te praten.
I think everyone sees that.	Ik tink dat elkenien dat sjocht.
I'm ready for bed.	Ik bin klear foar bêd.
How do you get here?	Hoe komme jo hjir hinne?
I would get nothing else from them.	Ik soe neat oars út har krije.
Be carefull!	Wês foarsichtich!
He had not asked what the reason was.	Hy hie net frege wat de reden wie.
I need this.	Ik haw dit nedich.
His hair was gone.	Syn hier wie fuort.
But he could still see her.	Mar hy koe har noch sjen.
It was something more.	It wie wat mear.
I wanted to get away.	Ik woe fuort fuort.
Nobody really wants anyone to know who they really are.	Nimmen wol echt dat immen wit wa't se echt binne.
He's not the problem here.	Hy is hjir net it probleem.
I wait, wait, and wait some more.	Ik wachtsje, wachtsje, en wachtsje noch wat.
But the city is the city.	Mar de stêd is de stêd.
They knew of the work we were doing.	Se wisten fan it wurk dat wy dogge.
He had heard nothing.	Hy hie neat heard.
She looked back at him.	Se seach him werom.
He is ready for you to enter.	Hy is klear foar jo om yn te gean.
Everyone walks away from here.	Elkenien giet hjir fuort.
I think he's scared of it.	Ik tink dat er der bang foar is.
Of course they did not tell you that.	Dat hawwe se dy fansels net sein.
You do not want to get in trouble.	Jo wolle net yn de problemen komme.
Just one of those.	Krekt ien fan dy.
Maybe that was good.	Miskien wie dat goed.
We need to talk to him as much as we can.	Wy moatte safolle as wy kinne mei him prate.
That you know they are going to something else.	Dat jo witte dat se nei wat oars geane.
There was nothing to see.	Der wie neat te sjen.
But you will know it in time.	Mar jo sille it op 'e tiid witte.
But try it.	Mar besykje it.
It's a lot of work.	It is in protte wurk.
I actually went there.	Ik bin der eins hinne gien.
I want to tell you even more.	Ik wol dy noch mear fertelle.
This would be difficult.	Dit soe dreech wurde.
I did not speak well to you for three days.	Ik haw trije dagen net goed mei dy praat.
I think it's over now.	Ik tink dat it der no oer is.
It remained open only one year.	It bleau mar ien jier iepen.
She does it well too.	Se docht it ek goed.
It has no idea.	It hat gjin idee.
They can be hard.	Se kinne hurd wêze.
I'm too old for you.	Ik bin te âld foar dy.
They said they would do it.	Se seine dat se dit dwaan soene.
I do not want you to be late for work.	Ik wol dy net te let op it wurk.
Why would they stop today.	Wêrom soene se hjoed ophâlde.
They had no way in.	Se hiene gjin wei yn.
One of a kind.	Ien fan in soarte.
I did not want to show it.	Ik woe it net sjen litte.
He said the whole city is talking about it.	Hy sei dat de hiele stêd der oer praat.
She would believe nothing but words.	Se soe neat leauwe as wurden.
The bus dropped them off.	De bus sette se ôf.
They have had enough.	Se hawwe genôch hân.
What was the reason?	Wat wie de reden?
But there was a problem with that.	Mar dêr wie in probleem mei.
You were here to have kids, and you almost had none.	Jo wiene hjir te hawwen bern, en do hast gjin hie.
He was on his own.	Hy wie op himsels.
That would do it.	Dat soe it dwaan.
But, this is up to you.	Mar, dit is oan jo.
I can say nothing about that.	Dêr kin ik neat oer sizze.
What she had seen.	Wat se sjoen hie.
You've seen her.	Jo hawwe har sjoen.
They did not know it.	Se wisten it net.
You just want it so bad for the child.	Jo wolle it gewoan sa min foar it bern.
But that's not the point anymore.	Mar dêr giet it net mear om.
It is much more than this.	It is folle mear as dit.
He waited and waited.	Hy wachte en wachte.
I have none.	Ik haw gjinien.
There was not much.	Der wie net folle.
Maybe even love you.	Miskien sels hâldt fan dy.
Not so with me.	Net sa mei my.
And well, it was for me.	En goed, it wie foar my.
Not that he has much.	Net dat er folle hat.
And he knew so much about so much.	En hy wist safolle oer safolle.
Another day or two, maybe three.	Noch in dei as twa, miskien trije.
You're doing it right.	Jo dogge it goed.
How much was this food?	Hoefolle wie dit iten?
Not even for himself.	Net iens foar himsels.
Let me just tell her we're here.	Lit my har mar fertelle dat wy hjir binne.
I'll leave a car waiting for her.	Ik sil in auto op har wachtsje litte.
Put it in there.	Doch it der yn.
There's your husband.	Dêr is dyn man.
He had no idea if this thing would work.	Hy hie gjin idee oft dit ding soe wurkje.
Everything went well.	Alles is goed gien.
That the se.	Dat die se.
I live here.	Ik wenje hjir.
Not a bad idea.	Gjin min idee.
It is, and it will be.	It is, en it sil wêze.
You can eat nothing.	Jo kinne neat ite.
And then we do it again.	En dan dogge wy it wer.
This comes before everything else.	Dit komt foar al it oare.
She looked like that.	Se seach der sa út.
I want you to do what you want.	Ik wol dat jo dogge wat jo wolle.
What had made her a good wife.	Wat hie se in goede frou makke.
He had heard nothing.	Hy hie neat heard.
Good job, if you can get it.	Goed wurk, as jo it krije kinne.
She did not do what she was told.	Se die net wat har sein waard.
I am back.	Ik bin der wer.
I do not know where it is now.	Ik wit net wêr't it no is.
I wondered how I could make it happen.	Ik frege my ôf hoe't ik it barre koe.
Maybe that will be you too.	Miskien sil dat jo ek wêze.
He never looked at her again.	Hy seach har noait wer oan.
I could stay for hours though.	Ik koe wol oeren bliuwe.
Everyone knows now.	Elkenien wit no.
I looked after her better this time.	Ik seach har dizze kear better nei.
I did not want to talk.	Ik woe net prate.
What are you going to do with the money?	Wat sille jo dwaan mei it jild?
Maybe he didn 't think so.	Miskien hat er it net tocht.
You're in the right place.	Jo binne op it goede plak.
He loves you very much.	Hy hâldt tige fan dy.
Mom did what she had to do.	Mem die wat se dwaan moast.
He's sitting right now in things.	Hy sit no krekt yn 'e dingen.
I'm not sure.	Ik bin der net wis fan.
In fact, that may not be necessary.	Eins kin dat net nedich wêze.
Like it or not.	Like it of net.
Faith is everything.	Leauwe is alles.
We had a job to do and we did it.	Wy hiene in baan te dwaan en wy diene it.
They had arrived on the scene.	Se wiene op it plak kommen.
I can not be sure of that.	Dêr kin ik net wis fan wêze.
He loves many of us.	Hy hâldt in protte fan ús.
I'm not much help.	Ik bin net folle help.
The boy did not want to talk.	De jonge woe net prate.
But there could be no one.	Mar der koe gjinien wêze.
Nobody looks back.	Nimmen sjocht werom.
We are not the first people she talks to.	Wy binne net de earste minsken mei wa't se praat.
We can do anything you want.	Wy kinne alles dwaan wat jo wolle.
Just for a few weeks.	Krekt foar in pear wike.
Make it three hours.	Meitsje it trije oere.
We did a good job.	Wy diene goed wurk.
But they did not.	Mar dat diene se net.
Everything else could wait.	Al it oare koe wachtsje.
Nobody said a word.	Nimmen sei in wurd.
I wish we had more time.	Ik winskje dat wy mear tiid hiene.
He easily convinced himself that he needed more.	Hy oertsjûge himsels maklik dat er mear nedich hie.
I do it a lot.	Ik doch it in protte.
I was never a woman before him.	Ik wie nea frou foar him.
Never, ever happened.	Nea, ea bard.
We should have seen him.	Wy hiene him sjen moatten.
I was interested in something else.	Ik wie ynteressearre yn wat oars.
So will everyone.	Sa sil elkenien.
You can do the same thing.	Jo kinne itselde ding dwaan.
This is all it can do.	Dit is alles wat it kin dwaan.
I want you to come too.	Ik wol dat jo ek komme.
But do not wait for it.	Mar wachtsje der net op.
They could not talk about it.	Dêr koene se net oer prate.
Or talk about it.	Of der oer praten.
I'm not sure.	Ik bin der wis fan net.
I know he's my friend.	Ik wit dat hy myn freon is.
It was not as if she knew anyone.	It wie net oft se immen koe.
I no longer work for you.	Ik wurkje net mear foar dy.
We pay for the school.	Wy betelje foar de skoalle.
It was clear what was.	It wie dúdlik wat wie.
We worked hard to get here.	Wy hawwe hurd wurke om hjir te kommen.
He asked for you.	Hy hat om dy frege.
That's the way it should be.	Sa moat it mar.
And you will get it.	En jo sille it krije.
They do what they have to do.	Se dogge wat se moatte dwaan.
She does it really well at her job.	Se docht it echt goed op har wurk.
They will not want it.	Se sille it net wolle.
I do not know exactly.	Ik wit it net krekt.
I had the same problem.	Ik hie itselde probleem.
But you will be really good.	Mar jo sille echt goed wêze.
I would not say a word.	Ik soe gjin wurd sizze.
But that's still here.	Mar dat is hjir noch dêr.
There is simply no time or question for that anymore.	Dêr is gewoan gjin tiid of fraach mear foar.
That I made very clear last time.	Dat makke ik de lêste kear hiel dúdlik.
But more needs to be done.	Mar der moat mear dien wurde.
Be very careful here.	Wês hjir tige foarsichtich.
Tomorrow we will both get better.	Moarn wurde wy beide better.
But it was too late to do anything about it.	Mar it wie te let om der wat oan te dwaan.
No one could ever say she did not love her children.	Nimmen koe ea sizze dat se net fan har bern hâlde.
It wants more people tonight.	It wol fannacht mear minsken.
Not even that.	Net iens dit.
I had no plan.	Ik hie gjin plan.
They were afraid to come out.	Se wiene bang om út te kommen.
See for yourself.	Sjoch dit sels.
Anyway, at least they didn't go down without explaining themselves first.	Hoe dan ek, miskien hawwe se my moarn wol in oere oan.
But no help.	Mar gjin help.
You will find.	Jo sille fine.
But maybe we should see it that way.	Mar miskien moatte wy it sa sjen.
We never would.	Wy soene nea.
Nothing else to say.	Neat oars te sizzen.
That he could work with one hand.	Dat koe er mei ien hân wurkje.
That's what we want to see.	Dat wolle wy sjen.
This was good fun.	Dit wie goed leuk.
But they will see.	Mar se sille sjen.
But it's definitely fun.	Mar it is wis leuk.
I will be his father.	Ik sil syn heit wêze.
You only have to do it once.	Jo hoege it mar ien kear te dwaan.
I had to do what was best for him.	Ik moast dwaan wat it bêste foar him wie.
That stops.	Dy hâldt op.
I'll be the bad guy.	Ik sil de minne keardel wêze.
If there is, you can have.	As der is, kinne jo hawwe.
They would not even wish this.	Se soene dit net iens winskje.
I was not so good at school.	Ik wie net sa goed op skoalle.
I can take some time now.	Ik kin no wat tiid nimme.
You know, people come and go.	Jo witte, minsken komme en gean.
We are not talking.	Wy prate net.
We have long tried to have children.	Wy hawwe lang besocht bern te krijen.
He was told he was in trouble.	Hy waard ferteld dat er yn de problemen siet.
You never know what might happen.	Jo witte noait wat der barre kin.
Please let them know how you think.	Lit se asjebleaft witte hoe't jo tinke.
I found nothing.	Ik fûn neat.
The water soon returned.	It wetter gie gau werom.
Now he had decided that was enough.	No hie er besletten dat it genôch wie.
I'm not a little hurt.	Ik bin net in bytsje sear.
Everything went in the book.	Alles gie yn it boek.
Of course it happens.	Fansels bart it.
But there are problems.	Mar der is problemen.
I knew how hard it was to look good in that place.	Ik wist hoe dreech it wie om goed te sjen op dat plak.
But still not.	Mar noch altyd net.
You should have too.	Jo soene ek hawwe.
Hope it goes well with you.	Hoopje dat it goed mei dy giet.
It just ran into me.	It rûn my gewoan yn.
He was angry at me.	Hy wie lilk op my.
Must be done in my office.	Moat dien wurde yn myn kantoar.
He was ready.	Hy wie klear.
She's not better.	Se is net better.
And will never.	En sil nea.
He says everything is going well.	Hy seit dat alles goed komt.
I wish she had a better life.	Ik wol dat se in better libben hat.
This should be fun.	Dit moat leuk wêze.
Do not tell me everything at once.	Fertel my net alles yn ien kear.
I made you.	Ik makke dy.
Come on, he said.	Kom op, sei er.
That's my last word.	Dat is myn lêste wurd.
I had her.	Ik hie har.
I know a thing or two about your kind.	Ik wit in ding as twa oer jo soarte.
It's his city.	It is syn stêd.
I do not see how they can be bad.	Ik sjoch net hoe't se min wêze kinne.
You will do this first.	Jo sille dit earst dwaan.
So do many people.	Sa dogge in protte minsken.
I do not know if it works or not.	Ik wit net oft it wurket of net.
They worry your mother.	Se meitsje jo mem soargen.
I want her there.	Ik wol har dêr.
I think we need to be careful.	Ik tink dat wy foarsichtich moatte wêze.
Indeed many.	Eins in protte.
My name was.	Myn namme wie.
I never knew until today.	Ik wist noait oant hjoed de dei.
She felt alive again, she felt good.	Se fielde har wer libben, fielde har goed.
Get out of my city.	Gean út myn stêd.
She needs more time.	Se hat mear tiid nedich.
We're doing it right.	Wy dogge it goed.
I'll do it.	Ik sil it dwaan.
I made this for my friend last week.	Ik makke dit foar myn freon ferline wike.
I'm working on it so hard right now.	Ik wurkje der no sa hurd oan.
I opened the door.	Ik die de doar iepen.
So we can not do much.	Sa kinne wy ​​net folle dwaan.
What is your favorite type of food?	Wat is dyn favorite soarte iten?
No see.	No seach se.
I asked him where he was going.	Ik frege him wêr't er hinne soe.
No one has any idea why or what made this.	Nimmen hat gjin idee wêrom of wat dit makke.
We both are.	Wy beide binne.
You take so many people with you.	Jo nimme safolle minsken mei.
You can do more than you think.	Jo kinne mear dwaan as jo tinke.
He did not return home.	Hy kaam net werom nei hûs.
None of it is easy.	Gjin fan it is maklik.
So it can be done.	Sa kin it dien wurde.
But it works well.	Mar it wurket goed.
Same here.	Hjir itselde.
That was the plan.	Dat wie it plan.
It's tomorrow	It noch moarn
I had not seen it.	Ik hie it net sjoen.
You get them talking.	Jo krije se oan it praten.
I just could not do it.	Ik koe it gewoan net dwaan.
You know it can not.	Jo witte dat it net kin.
He was not hard to find.	Hy wie net dreech te finen.
All things were one.	Alle dingen wiene ien.
But we do not.	Mar wy net.
When they all come to life, people will see it.	As se allegear ta libben komme, sille minsken it sjen.
They said it was not a problem.	Se seine dat it gjin probleem wie.
I waited for him, but he never came.	Ik wachte op him, mar hy kaam noait.
Do not take my word for it.	Nim myn wurd der net foar.
I saw him a lot that year.	Ik seach him dat jier in protte.
My boy.	Myn jonge.
I sat with her.	Ik siet by har.
There are two things that need to happen.	Der binne twa dingen dy't barre moatte.
Me neither.	Ik ek net.
I did not do it to get into trouble.	Ik haw it net dien om yn de problemen te kommen.
There is something to go on.	Der is wat wei te gean.
He made them.	Hy makke se.
That's my concern.	Dat is myn soargen.
Three or more.	Trije of mear.
You have our word.	Jo hawwe ús wurd.
I was fine with that.	Ik wie der goed mei.
I hope you enjoy the new job.	Ik hoopje dat jo de nije baan leuk fine.
You could tell him exactly what you thought.	Jo koene him krekt fertelle wat jo tocht.
My plan is not to have a plan.	Myn plan is gjin plan te hawwen.
I'm glad I'm free of him.	Ik bin bliid dat ik frij fan him bin.
You have a way with words.	Jo hawwe in manier mei wurden.
We have not heard back.	Wy hawwe net heard werom.
What are we doing now? 	Wat dogge wy no?

It must be from her.	It moat fan har wêze.
It's not going well with your mother.	It giet net goed mei dyn mem.
I will say this.	Ik sil dit wol sizze.
I love doing my job.	Ik hâld fan myn wurk te dwaan.
Where are we going?	Wêr geane wy ​​hinne?
Now not much more.	No net folle mear.
In my house he would have only one name.	Yn myn hûs soe er mar ien namme hawwe.
They could now do whatever they wanted.	Se koene no dwaan wat se graach wolle.
The child could not stay here.	It bern koe hjir net bliuwe.
He had to become what he would be.	Hy moast wurde wat er wêze soe.
That was when we actually started.	Dat wiene wy ​​eins begûn.
A young family.	In jonge famylje.
I made it easy for him.	Ik makke it maklik foar him.
John is a good friend.	John is in goede freon.
This is your last chance.	Dit is dyn lêste kâns.
And so the name remained.	En sa bleau de namme.
The man was gone.	De man wie fuort.
But one thing.	Mar ien ding.
That's true enough.	Dat is wier genôch.
No one here.	Gjinien hjir.
Maybe she was expecting something different.	Miskien hie se wat oars ferwachte.
You do not want to know why someone did something.	Jo wolle net witte wêrom't immen wat dien hat.
I'm not sure if it's' good.	Ik bin der net wis fan oft it 'goed' is.
You do not have to be afraid.	Jo moatte net bang wêze.
He did not see.	Hy seach net.
You really do not.	Jo echt net.
To get off.	Om ôf te kommen.
This they did not expect.	Dit hiene se net ferwachte.
And that she never was.	En dat wie se noait.
He wanted to leave soon.	Hy woe gau fuort.
She must have been waiting for me.	Se moat op my wachte hawwe.
Then do nothing.	Doch dan neat.
The water was still running.	It wetter rûn noch.
Everything works.	Alles wurket.
Well, there I am.	No, dêr bin ik.
He felt good.	Hy fielde him goed.
You just want to know them.	Jo wolle se gewoan witte.
Until he was not.	Oant hy net wie.
I think they did.	Ik tink dat se diene.
My hair is very long.	Myn hier is hiel lang.
I want you to know that it is not you.	Ik wol dat jo witte dat it jo net binne.
This is how it happened.	Dit is hoe't dat barde.
Let them take care of you.	Lit se foar jo soargje.
There are people who need you as their friend.	D'r binne minsken dy't jo nedich hawwe as har freon.
Let's eat today!	Lit ús hjoed ite!
It was hard at first to figure them out.	It wie earst dreech om har út te meitsjen.
He had worked hard all his life.	Hy hie syn hiele libben hurd wurke.
But, really, everything would.	Mar, echt, alles soe.
I'll look into it.	Ik sil der nei sjen.
It died two days ago.	It stoar twa dagen lyn.
She had only been in town a week.	Se hie mar in wike yn 'e stêd west.
I'm really happy with that.	Dêr bin ik echt bliid mei.
Everything old is tired.	Alles âld is wurch.
Come on, let's go.	Kom op, litte wy gean.
I wanted us.	Ik woe ús.
And it's bad.	En it is min.
I'm not so sure about the good thing.	Ik bin net sa wis oer it goede ding.
That would have done it.	Dat hie it dien.
Everything, and nothing.	Alles, en neat.
She has no idea what she's talking about.	Se hat gjin idee wêr't se it oer hat.
Didn't even try.	Wie net iens besykje.
Let's make this fun.	Litte wy dit leuk meitsje.
I went through his book.	Ik gie troch syn boek.
But it did not.	Mar it die net.
And she's good.	En se is goed.
This time he was sure.	Dizze kear wie er wis.
That's what the woman does.	Dat docht de frou.
That was what the book had to say.	Dat hie it boek sein.
That will, not now.	Dat wol, no net.
Think about them a lot.	Tink in protte oan har.
He had said nothing so far.	Hy hie oant no ta neat sein.
But not from people.	Mar net fan minsken.
It is made to be.	It is makke om te wêzen.
Waiting will help.	Wachtsje sil helpe.
I shook his hand.	Ik joech him de hân oan.
Quite simply.	Hiel gewoan.
We do not have to tell him anything.	Wy hoege him neat te fertellen.
A boy or a girl, she did not know.	In jonge of in famke, dat wist se net.
She would not let him.	Se soe him net litte litte.
They were not there to hurt him or anyone.	Se wiene der net om him of immen sear te dwaan.
I took her with me too.	Ik naam har ek mei.
This was so good.	Dit wie sa goed.
The child looked up at her.	It bern seach nei har op.
But do it once, not once a week.	Mar doch it ien kear, net ien kear yn 'e wike.
They just do not believe.	Se leauwe gewoan net.
But they do get over it.	Mar se komme der wol oer.
It was hard to talk to him.	It wie dreech om mei him te praten.
It never stopped being good.	It bleau noait goed te wêzen.
But she was determined to leave.	Mar se wie besletten om fuort te gean.
I just could not let that happen.	Ik koe dat gewoan net barre litte.
He does not have to be.	Hy hoecht net te wêzen.
There may have been.	Der kin west hawwe.
I'll have to go there.	Ik sil der hinne moatte.
This is my friend.	Dit is myn freon.
I was happy to see it.	Ik wie bliid om it te sjen.
Are you ready to go?	Bist klear om te gean?
It just seems so wrong.	It liket gewoan sa ferkeard.
It does not work that well.	It wurket net sa gewoan.
This year it's different.	Dit jier is it oars.
We live here too.	Wy wenje hjir ek.
And if we do not do that, then we must not.	En as wy dat net dogge, dan moatte wy net.
But more than that.	Mar mear as dat.
It just can not be done.	It kin gewoan net dien wurde.
It worked, but you can not see it.	It wurke, mar jo kinne it net sjen.
I did not ask her.	Ik haw har net frege.
As if they still had work to do.	As hiene se noch wurk te dwaan.
I was nothing to him.	Ik wie neat foar him.
See where that came to me.	Sjoch wêr't dat my kaam.
my mom	Myn mem.
The people love us.	De minsken hâlde fan ús.
The class is difficult.	De klasse is dreech.
You never know what you might need.	Jo witte noait wat jo miskien nedich hawwe.
He does not see her.	Hy sjocht har net.
Feel free to do so.	Fiel jo frij om dat te dwaan.
I do not know for sure.	Ik wit it net wis.
It does not matter much.	It makket net folle út.
But the hour is late.	Mar it oere is let.
No one is angry with you.	Nimmen is lilk op dy.
Work together, if you can.	Wurkje tegearre, as jo kinne.
He does not want to talk to me.	Hy wol net mei my prate.
It could not.	It koe net.
I hope you find them.	Ik hoopje dat jo har fine.
I do not eat that.	Dat yt ik net.
It's time for you to get to work.	It is tiid foar jo om oan it wurk te kommen.
Go away and do it.	Gean fuort en doch it.
Both are true.	Beide binne wier.
Now we are told that we can not get food.	No wurdt ús ferteld dat wy gjin iten krije kinne.
Very good, very good.	Hiel goed, hiel goed.
I never really knew you.	Ik koe dy noait echt.
I'm sure he's doing it with you.	Ik bin der wis fan dat hy it mei dy docht.
I'm glad he's gone.	Ik bin bliid dat er fuort is.
She knew of nothing more.	Se wist fan neat mear.
There was only one left.	Der bleau mar ien oer.
And it worked.	En it wurke.
Well, enough about him.	No, genôch oer him.
Since that time.	Sûnt dy tiid.
Leave him here.	Lit him hjir.
I would love to try it.	Ik soe it graach besykje.
I did the right thing.	Ik die it goede ding.
The child was happy.	It bern wie bliid.
It's the place you made it.	It is it plak dat jo hawwe makke.
You are now leaving home for your wife.	Jo geane no fan hûs nei jo frou.
They so want to believe the best of their children.	Se wolle sa graach it bêste fan har bern leauwe.
And also not good.	En ek net goed.
It will be like.	It sil wêze as.
He was not sure why he came.	Hy wie net wis wêrom't er kaam.
My father was in a meeting.	Myn heit wie yn in gearkomste.
They said nothing.	Se seine neat.
But that was good, she thought.	Mar dat wie goed, tocht se.
.	.
And that was it, there was no going back.	En dat wie it, der wie gjin wei werom.
You will regret one of these days.	Jo sille ien fan dizze dagen spyt hawwe.
Nobody needed it.	Nimmen hie it nedich.
To tell me the truth.	Om my de wierheid te fertellen.
How does he do this?	Hoe docht er dit?
I'm not trying to say such a thing.	Ik besykje net sa'n ding te sizzen.
I had to do what was good.	Ik moast dwaan wat goed wie.
He would not talk to her now.	Hy soe no net mei har prate.
She had become as beautiful as her mother.	Se wie sa moai wurden as har mem.
My dog ​​stayed with me.	Myn hûn bleau by my.
Said it would be the last time.	Sei dat it de lêste kear wêze soe.
I want you to be better than me.	Ik wol dat jo better binne as my.
I was sitting with some friends.	Ik siet mei wat freonen.
And do things.	En dingen dwaan.
I would not have it.	Ik soe it net ha.
As the first.	As de earste.
Had he started this? 	Hie er dit begûn?
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
I can not say where, exactly.	Ik kin net sizze wêr, krekt.
Everyone talks about them.	Elkenien praat oer har.
And this would help to deal with that problem.	En dit soe helpe om te gean mei dat probleem.
And so did we.	En dat diene wy ​​ek.
They are me.	Se binne my.
You can, but I can not.	Jo kinne, mar ik net.
I just want to be sure.	Ik wol gewoan wis wêze.
You have or not.	Jo hawwe of net.
Think it through with me.	Tink it mei my troch.
The young woman wants children.	De jonge frou wol bern.
What's happening? 	Wat bart der?
You never loved me.	Do hast noait fan my hâlden.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
He may not even want it.	Hy kin it net iens wolle.
I have no idea how much of that is true.	Ik haw gjin idee hoefolle fan dat is wier.
I was so ordinary.	Ik wie sa gewoan.
She looked up in surprise.	Se seach ferrast op.
Life seemed difficult to her.	It libben like har dreech.
You can just be out there for too long.	Jo kinne der gewoan te lang út wêze.
It's hard to deal with two kids.	It is dreech om mei twa bern om te gean.
He gave me a job when no one else would.	Hy joech my in baan doe't gjinien oars soe.
I thought it went well.	Ik tocht dat it goed gie.
It does not work for me for some reason.	It wurket om ien of oare reden net foar my.
You will see in this.	Jo sille sjen yn dizze.
To help other people.	Om oare minsken te helpen.
That's what we find.	Dat fine wy ​​wol.
That has been clear from the start.	Dat is fan it earste ôf dúdlik west.
It just has to be you.	It moat gewoan dy wêze.
Life was good.	It libben wie goed.
One last question.	Ien lêste fraach.
Nothing of the woman.	Neat fan de frou.
Now there were only two.	No wiene der mar twa.
I wish she would come over.	Ik winskje dat se soe komme oer.
My friend knows, but that's it.	Myn freon wit, mar dat is it.
Maybe they don’t stay.	Miskien bliuwe se net.
The few of you.	It pear fan dy.
You will see where we go when we get there.	Jo sille sjen wêr't wy hinne gean as wy dêr komme.
But we did not think much about it.	Mar wy ha der net folle oan tocht.
You have to see him.	Jo moatte him sjen.
The man and his wife are getting very old.	De man en syn frou wurde hurd âld.
We did not have time to do anything for a long time.	Wy krigen lang gjin tiid om wat te dwaan.
I came here.	Ik bin hjir kommen om.
And that still hurts a bit.	En dat docht noch wol wat sear.
He has a chance without us.	Hy hat in kâns sûnder ús.
And, it's wrong.	En, it is ferkeard.
But she did not know that.	Mar dat wist se net.
It was very nice place.	It wie hiel moai plak.
It still did not work.	It wurke noch altyd net.
It's what your father wants.	It is wat dyn heit wol.
What will become of you?	Wat sil der fan dy wurde?
I'm sorry to say they're true.	It spyt my om te sizzen dat se wier binne.
This would not be fun.	Dit soe net leuk wurde.
We talk all the time.	Wy prate de hiele tiid.
He went out of his way to help.	Hy gie út 'e wei om te helpen.
Never thought she was seen much.	Nea tocht dat se in protte te sjen wie.
I can not quite tomorrow.	Ik kin moarn net hielendal.
For today, either.	Foar hjoed, of.
You are where you want to be.	Jo binne wêr't jo wêze wolle.
The child was not here.	It bern wie hjir net.
But this felt nothing like that.	Mar dit fielde neat as dat.
We want to be free.	Wy wolle frij wêze.
We have to be careful.	Wy moatte foarsichtich wêze.
You have him.	Jo hawwe him.
All in to see them.	Alles yn om se te sjen.
We just realized we could not.	Wy realisearre gewoan dat wy net koene.
Only, it was not.	Allinnich, it wie net.
I will not go.	Ik sil net gean.
I knew that now.	Dat wist ik no.
I'll find him.	Ik sil him fine.
I looked good.	Ik seach der goed út.
Life looks different.	It libben sjocht der oars út.
She just will not.	Se sil gewoan net.
That's the question, isn 't it?	Dat is de fraach, is it net?
She was very angry.	Se wie tige lilk.
If we can not give you what you want, we will tell you.	As wy jo net kinne jaan wat jo wolle, sille wy jo fertelle.
I'm here with you.	Ik bin hjir mei dy.
I would say three hours.	Ik soe sizze trije oeren.
You just have to look and see.	Jo moatte gewoan sjen en sjen.
It seemed like nothing.	It like neat.
He had to be found.	Hy moast fûn wurde.
She had hoped he had not seen it.	Se hie hope dat er it net sjoen hie.
I do not like people.	Ik hâld net fan minsken.
I could tell.	Ik soe kinne fertelle.
I want to believe her.	Ik wol har leauwe.
We need some time.	Wy hawwe wat tiid nedich.
Mom will not talk to me.	Mem sil net mei my prate.
There is a .	Der is in .
Everything we did together.	Alles wat wy tegearre diene.
Then the question will be to get them out again.	Dan sil de fraach wêze om se wer út te krijen.
He could easily say that.	Dat koe er maklik sizze.
Everyone has a job to do.	Elkenien hat in baan te dwaan.
I know better.	Ik wit better.
So much to say.	Safolle te sizzen.
I would never come across a man.	Ik soe nea komme op in man.
I'm going to help him.	Ik gean him te helpen.
But let's do it differently today.	Mar litte wy it hjoed oars dwaan.
I have to put it on.	Ik moat it oan.
There was no one left.	Der wie gjinien oer.
This was your plan.	Dit wie dyn plan.
There seemed to be no reason for that.	Der like gjin reden foar te wêzen.
It seems like everyone.	It liket derop dat elkenien.
He would not just leave it open for everyone to find.	Hy soe it net gewoan iepen litte foar elkenien om te finen.
It’s actually even fun, so little, she said.	It is eins sels leuk, sa'n bytsje, sei se.
I'm so happy to be here.	Ik bin sa bliid hjir te wêzen.
It's good she could not see me.	It is goed dat se my net sjen koe.
He's going to take me to a movie.	Hy is fan plan om my nei in film te nimmen.
I'm a friend of her friends.	Ik bin in freon fan har freonen.
We have a chance.	Wy hawwe in kâns.
So you can actually see what's going on.	Sa kinne jo eins sjen wat der bart.
He got one of those.	Hy krige ien fan dy.
And this is exactly the problem.	En dit is krekt it probleem.
The new.	De nije.
Think of your family.	Tink oan jo famylje.
But that was not what happened.	Mar dat wie net wat der barde.
His father was ill and needed his help.	Syn heit wie siik en hie syn help nedich.
I never wanted anything different from him.	Ik woe noait wat oars fan him.
I would be happy if I had him.	Ik soe bliid wêze as ik him ha.
He would pay.	Hy soe betelje.
But that did not happen.	Mar sa barde it net.
I just wanted great.	Ik woe allinnich grutte.
I'm here for you.	Ik bin hjir foar dy.
I do not have them.	Ik haw har net.
But in those days, the police could not.	Mar yn dy dagen koe de plysje net.
We are not afraid.	Wy binne net bang.
They were not done with him.	Se wiene net klear mei him.
Here comes my question.	Hjir komt myn fraach.
I'm looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der sa nei út.
That was a first for us.	Dat wie in earste foar ús.
Try to make the most of it.	Besykje hjir it bêste fan te meitsjen.
You work hard all the time.	Jo wurkje hurd de hiele tiid.
Well, that's my job.	No, dat is myn wurk.
And it was very difficult for me.	En it wie hiel dreech foar my.
They have not left home yet.	Se binne noch net fan hûs gien.
That's not what makes it fun.	Dat is net wat it leuk makket.
I was pretty busy.	Ik wie moai drok.
Not so mine.	Net sa myn.
You are not leaving here.	Jo geane hjir net fuort fan.
That's where they keep him.	Dêr hâlde se him oan.
Just have to be careful.	Krekt moatte wêze foarsichtich.
Whether they pay, or whether they do not pay.	Oft se betelje, of oft se net betelje.
I do not want.	Ik wol net.
Not really what we had in mind.	Net echt wat wy yn gedachten hiene.
I have your letter for me.	Ik haw dyn brief foar my.
Here we are again.	Hjir binne wy ​​wer.
I met him last night.	Ik moete him fannacht.
But let's go and see.	Mar lit ús gean en sjen.
Then, just play it as needed.	Dan, gewoan spylje it as it nedich is.
I stayed at the first.	Ik bleau by de earste.
You do not want to be found, he says.	Jo wolle net fûn wurde, seit er.
The truth can set us free.	De wierheid kin ús frij meitsje.
They will get what they like to see.	Se sille krije wat se graach sjen.
Nobody can see me.	Nimmen kin my sjen.
He looks at me.	Hy sjocht my oan.
I do not see the problem.	Ik sjoch it probleem net.
That would be good.	Dat soe goed wêze.
You do not have much time.	Jo hawwe net folle tiid.
This is like a family.	Dit is as in famylje.
He was just easy.	Hy wie net maklik.
Say it all well.	Se die alles goed.
You do not have to do it, but you just can not help it.	Jo moatte it net dwaan, mar jo kinne it gewoan net helpe.
That should not have happened either.	Dat hie ek net dwaan moatten.
It would not be fun.	It soe net leuk wêze.
I went to bed late last night.	Ik gie fannacht let op bêd.
How can we possibly be friends.	Hoe kinne wy ​​miskien wêze freonen.
Everyone was there.	Elkenien wie der.
I do not know this person.	Ik ken dizze persoan net.
I do not know what we did.	Ik wit net wat wy dien hawwe.
I see no reason for hope.	Ik sjoch gjin reden foar hope.
Ask each other things.	Elkoar dingen freegje.
They are essentially the same thing.	Se binne yn wêzen itselde ding.
I feel that way.	Ik fiel dat sa.
He had never seen the woman like that before.	Hy hie de frou noch noait sa sjoen.
The boy was not to be seen.	De jonge wie net te sjen.
She needs your help.	Se hat jo help nedich.
I tried something different this time.	Ik besocht wat oars dizze kear.
But it's all for nothing.	Mar it is allegear foar neat.
I would have eaten here.	Ik soe hjir iten hawwe.
It is now a city in itself.	It is no in stêd op himsels.
And they will all know what you have done.	En se sille allegear witte wat jo dien hawwe.
They never did that to me.	Se hawwe nea dien mei my.
He just wanted to talk.	Hy woe net prate.
I'm pretty happy about it.	Ik bin der aardich bliid oer.
That was just the first thing.	Dat wie krekt it earste ding.
Her mother left.	Har mem gie.
Or were there even.	Of wiene der sels.
I'm really late.	Ik bin echt te let.
And they could.	En se koene.
I could not ask about another man.	Ik koe net freegje oer in oare man.
They do not want that.	Dat wolle se net.
I'm long gone then.	Ik bin dan al lang fuort.
This was too good.	Dit wie te goed.
There was no one around.	Der wie gjinien om.
This time he can do better.	Dizze kear kin hy better.
That was it, he saw it now.	Dat wie it, hy seach it no.
We would be.	Wy soene wêze.
You will not need it.	Jo sille it net nedich hawwe.
If you need or want anything, please let me know.	As jo ​​​​wat nedich binne of wolle, lit it my dan witte.
You should not watch only once a week.	Jo moatte net sjen mar ien kear yn 'e wike.
But it should not.	Mar it moat net.
How nice of you to come.	Wat moai dat jo komme.
But now, he wanted more.	Mar no, hy woe mear.
By seeing the word.	Troch it wurd te sjen.
She just does not know what it's about.	Se wit gewoan net wêr't it oer giet.
He knows where you live.	Hy wit wêr't jo wenje.
You did this all last year all the time.	Jo hawwe dit ferline jier de hiele tiid dien.
But it has not always been so.	Mar it hat net altyd sa west.
I did not want to pay for that.	Dat woe ik net betelje.
Do you want this too ?.	Wolle jo dit ek?.
If not already.	As it al net.
Whether all goes well or not.	Oft alles goed komt of net.
But the water really came.	Mar it wetter kaam echt.
Not sure why it does not work.	Net wis wêrom't it net wurket.
I saw some of that from him.	Ik seach dêr wat fan fan him.
If you do not know what those are.	As jo ​​​​net witte wat dat binne.
I want to be with my friends.	Ik wol by myn freonen wêze.
We were worried.	Wy wiene soargen.
I expected her to say something against it.	Ik ferwachte dat se der wat tsjin soe sizze.
That was just as difficult.	Dat wie like dreech.
I have no idea what it says.	Ik haw gjin idee wat it seit.
Ask someone out.	Freegje immen út.
That's a difficult one.	Dat is in dreech.
I would say yours.	Ik soe sizze dyn.
I'm sure she's fine with that.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se dêr hielendal goed mei komt.
I do nothing.	Ik doch neat.
But do not be long.	Mar wês net lang.
Got another guy.	Krige in oare keardel.
I wish we had kept that name.	Ik winskje dat wy dy namme hâlden hiene.
I was surprised to find it there.	Ik wie ferrast om it dêr te finen.
She was not quite ready to give up to look beautiful.	Se wie net hielendal ree om op te jaan om moai te sjen.
I will only be here a year.	Ik sil hjir mar in jier wêze.
She is as happy as it can be.	Se is sa bliid as it kin.
But they had no following.	Mar se hiene gjin folgjende.
He found me earlier.	Hy fûn my earder.
The man had done his job well.	De man hie syn wurk goed dien.
She had no friends.	Se hie gjin freonen.
Good or bad it has its day.	Goed of min hat it syn dei.
I feel bad for the guy.	Ik fiel my min foar de keardel.
Really, it's just a movie.	Echt, it is gewoan in film.
I saw that picture this morning.	Ik seach dy foto fan 'e moarn.
She would take care of everything.	Se soe foar alles soargje.
A man came to the door.	Der kaam in man foar de doar.
But it was what they needed.	Mar it wie wat se nedich wiene.
You will have nothing.	Jo sille neat hawwe.
I looked good.	Ik seach goed.
I just thought he could handle this dog.	Ik tocht gewoan dat hy dizze hûn koe.
I look forward to eating with her.	Ik sjoch út nei it iten mei har.
He liked to keep her waiting.	Hy mocht har graach wachtsje litte.
Once or twice, once or twice against.	Ien of twa kear, ien of twa kear tsjin.
Nothing more than that.	Neat mear as.
He also did not know what to do.	Hy wist ek net wat er dwaan moast.
I'm still yours.	Ik bin noch altyd dyn.
This place felt like a good friend.	Dit plak fielde as in goede freon.
Please make it yours.	Meitsje it asjebleaft fan jo.
He could not either.	Hy koe ek net.
That's the boy.	Dat is de jonge.
It's a house, of course.	It is in hûs, fansels.
Then only one.	Dan mar ien.
And on.	En oan.
Do not worry, we are waiting for you.	Sit gjin soargen, wy wachtsje op dy.
Something is happening now, but we do not know what and where.	Der bart no wat, mar wy witte net wat en wêr.
Not once has it happened.	Net ien kear is it bard.
In the past, they did.	Yn it ferline diene se.
Are you happy to see me?	Binne jo bliid om my te sjen?
But he felt he had to win.	Mar hy fûn dat hy moast winne.
The mother was good too.	De mem wie ek goed.
I could not imagine what I would say.	Ik koe net tinke wat ik sizze soe.
This is not necessary.	Dit is net nedich.
We must do everything we can to help children.	Wy moatte alles dwaan wat wy kinne om bern te helpen.
Come to mind.	Kom yn gedachten.
Well, we should get here.	No, wy soene hjir komme moatte.
On this kind of work.	Op dit soarte fan wurk.
He had a plan and he saw it through.	Hy hie in plan en hy seach it troch.
We do not have much time.	Wy hawwe net folle tiid.
One day, everything will be gone.	Op in dei sil alles fuort wêze.
I met him on the first day of school this year.	Ik moete him op de earste dei fan skoalle dit jier.
We had nothing like this.	Wy hiene neat as dit.
It should not happen.	It soe net moatte barre.
He will not need her.	Hy sil har net nedich hawwe.
I need to know something about you.	Ik moat jo wat witte.
Well done.	Goed dien.
They wait and wait.	Se wachtsje en wachtsje.
I always do around that hour.	Ik doch altyd om dat oere hinne.
Your parents will surely.	Jo âlden sille wis.
That scared me so much.	Dat makke my sa bang.
Please, just do not.	Asjebleaft, gewoan net.
He did not know of the letter he had received.	Hy wist net fan it brief dat er krige hie.
I said he had to buy one.	Ik sei dat er ien keapje moast.
Never try to do everything yourself.	Besykje noait alles sels te dwaan.
I was just doing a job.	Ik die allinnich mar in wurk.
You know what's there.	Jo witte wat der is.
There are a lot of problems in this movie.	D'r binne in protte problemen yn dizze film.
I feel scared.	Ik fiel my bang.
She was always late.	Se wie altyd let.
I've been there.	Ik bin dêr west.
A way to do that came to him.	In manier om dat te dwaan kaam him op.
I know you want kids.	Ik wit dat jo bern wolle.
I do not really need them.	Ik haw se net echt nedich.
I would not do it.	Ik soe it net dwaan.
That's it really.	Dat is it echt.
I would love to have him.	Ik woe him wol graach wolle.
She could not find it, felt nothing.	Se koe it net fine, fielde neat.
Something about it.	Der wat oer.
That also did not say much.	Dat sei ek net folle.
Well, maybe more than a little scared.	No, miskien mear as in bytsje bang.
She has a large family.	Se hat in grutte famylje.
He had not needed it since she died.	Hy hie it net nedich sûnt se stoar.
You have to go back.	Jo moatte werom.
They were better.	Se wiene better.
They are just as good.	Se binne krekt sa goed.
It has been a long time.	It hat al lang west.
She does not even have a name.	Se hat net iens in namme.
We have now gone twice.	Wy binne no twa kear gien.
Things have gone very well.	Dingen binne hiel goed gien.
But we did it.	Mar wy diene it.
These things are just that.	Dizze dingen binne gewoan.
I've talked to you.	Ik haw mei dy praat.
So would many other people.	Sa soe in protte oare minsken.
A dog's life.	In hûn syn libben.
I wish he could.	Ik winskje dat er koe.
She could not talk to us.	Se koe net mei ús prate.
She had never had the chance.	Se hie nea de kâns hân.
This would take a lot of work.	Dit soe in protte wurk nimme.
I know you got one.	Ik wit dat jo ien krigen hawwe.
I think the work did him good.	Ik tink dat it wurk him goed dien hat.
It happens every day now.	It bart no alle dagen.
I wonder what they did with it.	Ik freegje my ôf wat se der mei dien hawwe.
He told himself to go for it.	Hy sei tsjin himsels om der foar te gean.
I could never find enough time week to week.	Ik koe nea fine genôch tiid wike ta wike.
That is not necessary.	Dat is net nedich.
I can see nothing.	Ik kin neat sjen.
It's as good as it gets.	It is sa goed as it is.
For the first time in his entire life, he felt whole.	Foar it earst yn syn hiele libben fielde er him hiel.
He thought about the question.	Hy tocht oer de fraach.
Should we do something?	Wy moatte wol wat dwaan?
And he never saw it.	En hy hat it noait sjoen.
It can be done once a year.	It kin ien kear yn it jier.
And nothing was ever given to us as children.	En neat waard oait jûn oan ús as bern.
She knew she could not.	Se wist dat se dat net koe.
He should win her back too.	Hy soe har ek werom winne moatte.
And will think about what to do with this.	En sil tinke oer wat te dwaan mei dit.
You know you will.	Jo witte dat jo sille.
We keep them here.	Wy hâlde se hjir.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Binne jo wis dat jo dit dwaan wolle?
I think we need to talk about this.	Ik tink dat wy hjir oer moatte prate.
They did nothing.	Se hawwe neat dien.
It is up to you to say whether it will do so.	It is oan jo om te sizzen oft it dat sil dwaan.
Give her a reason.	Jou har in reden.
That is stated in the book.	Dat stiet yn it boek.
Here she is with her mother and father.	Hjir is se mei har mem en heit.
It should not hurt.	It soe gjin sear moatte.
They just don’t make them like that anymore.	Se meitsje se gewoan net mear sa.
But he kept them to himself.	Mar hy hâlde se foar himsels.
This is for both of you.	Dit is foar jo beide.
Friends would tell friends and such.	Freonen soene freonen fertelle en sa.
We've talked about that for a long time.	Dêr ha wy it lang oer hân.
The whole plan.	It hiele plan.
We said that was nothing.	Wy seine dat wie neat.
Neither is needed anymore.	Gjin fan beide is mear nedich.
He would be on time.	Hy soe op tiid wêze.
You will take care of his parents.	Jo sille soargje foar syn âlden.
I know you have work to do.	Ik wit dat jo wurk te dwaan hawwe.
I took the children.	Ik naam de bern.
It is clear that we are alone again.	It is dúdlik dat wy wer allinnich binne.
But he was happy to take the money.	Mar hy wie bliid om it jild te nimmen.
But he did not say it.	Mar hy sei it net.
We need to talk about everything well.	Wy moatte oer alles goed prate.
I can.	Ik kin.
Not enough words today.	Gjin genôch wurden hjoed.
Everything we have, you should have too.	Alles wat wy hawwe, soene jo ek hawwe.
Long time no see.	Lang net sjoen.
Keep the faith.	Hâld it leauwe.
I had only been to him a few times, but we were careful.	Ik hie mar in pear kear by him west, mar wy wiene foarsichtich.
I must have it.	Ik moat it hawwe.
I had never been there before.	Ik hie der noch noait earder west.
I was angry too.	Ik wie ek lilk.
Of course, it has never been the same way twice.	Fansels is it noait twa kear deselde manier wurden.
Well, it was such a bit.	No, it wie sa'n bytsje.
Her children too.	Har bern ek.
Feel it out and see.	Fiel it út en sjoch.
My father is not really with her.	Myn heit is eins net by har.
Nothing looked right.	Der seach neat út.
He had worked with her for three years.	Hy hie trije jier mei har wurke.
Keep it that way.	Hâld it sa.
Just go inside.	Gean gewoan yn.
Maybe you let them stay.	Miskien litte jo se bliuwe.
It was the same now.	It wie no itselde.
Mom came in.	Mem kaam yn.
On one and beautiful.	Op ien en moai.
Or maybe they already asked the dog.	Of miskien hawwe se de hûn al frege.
She pretended not to hear him.	Se die oft se him net hearde.
You're waiting here.	Jo wachtsje hjir.
It would not happen again.	It soe net wer barre.
I could not eat.	Ik koe net ite.
Or her to his.	Of har oan syn.
Time enough.	Tiid genôch.
He saw it.	Hy seach it.
He did not read the whole letter.	Hy hat de hiele brief net lêzen.
But this was the big city.	Mar dit wie de grutte stêd.
So the boy came back just before dinner.	Dat de jonge kaam krekt foar it iten werom.
I have not finished my work yet.	Ik haw myn wurk noch net klear.
It has been done before.	It is earder dien.
Must be too tired.	Moat te wurch wêze.
She would have nothing to worry about anymore.	Se soe har neat mear soargen hoege te meitsjen.
We will be careful that this is not true.	Wy sille foarsichtich dat dat net wier is.
It's clear they have.	It is dúdlik dat se hawwe.
And nothing yet the same problems.	En neat noch deselde problemen.
There was more, too.	Der wie ek mear.
It went off.	It gie ôf.
Nothing of the past.	Neat fan it ferline.
Take both now.	Nim no beide.
Or tried.	Of besocht.
I need to do something for you.	Ik moat dy wat dwaan.
I worked there.	Ik haw dêr wurke.
There was only one man who could be him.	Der wie mar ien man dy't him wêze koe.
He had been such a young man, but not anymore.	Hy hie sa'n jonge man west, mar net mear.
You have to do this.	Jo moatte dit dwaan.
Be ready to be busy !.	Wês klear om drok te wêzen!.
Let's see what we can do here.	Litte wy sjen wat wy hjir kinne meitsje.
This was exactly what he needed.	Dit wie krekt wat hy nedich hie.
What a guy.	Wat in keardel.
There was nothing in me that wanted to stop.	Der wie neat yn my dat ophâlde woe.
My mother said he had to go to jail.	Myn mem sei dat er nei de finzenis moast.
Why people get sick.	Wêrom minsken wurde siik.
We were just talking.	Wy wiene gewoan oan it praten.
And am happy.	En bin bliid.
We'll wait an hour.	Wy wachtsje in oere.
There is so much to do.	Der is safolle te dwaan.
No one there either.	Dêr ek gjinien.
Not one child died today.	Net ien bern stoar hjoed.
But it's not her job.	Mar it is net har wurk.
If she ever does.	As se ea docht.
Then, before you know it, he would be home.	Dan, foardat jo it wisten, soe hy thús wêze.
I did not want to tell him how good it was for him.	Ik woe him net fertelle hoe goed it foar him wie.
And maybe you're one.	En miskien binne jo ien.
An opportunity was all she wanted.	In kâns wie alles wat se woe.
What it does to people.	Wat it mei minsken docht.
I did not want anyone to see me.	Ik woe net dat ien my seach.
No one had met her yet.	Nimmen hie se noch moete.
I'm here with you.	Ik bin hjir mei dy.
Everyone in the room knew what had to happen.	Elkenien yn 'e keamer wist wat der bard wêze moast.
You can now talk to him about what you need.	Jo kinne no mei him prate oer wat jo nedich binne.
Probably just my mom.	Wierskynlik allinnich myn mem.
I hope you like them.	Ik hoopje dat jo se leuk fine.
He clearly wanted to get out of there.	Hy woe der dúdlik krekt út.
They were in.	Se wiene yn.
I gave up.	Ik joech op.
Day.	Dei.
Be your best self '.	Wês dyn bêste sels'.
I thought about where I needed to go.	Ik tocht oer wêr't ik hinne moast.
I did a pretty good job.	Ik haw in aardich goed wurk dien.
That was true, of course.	Dat wie wier, fansels.
Maybe he would be out of the house.	Miskien soe er it hûs út wêze.
Life is good.	Libben is goed.
Maybe, but not soon.	Miskien, mar net gau.
I do not know what the problem is.	Ik wit net wat it probleem is.
But that is not likely here.	Mar dat is hjir net wierskynlik.
As he does, and we had met a few times.	As hy docht, en wy hiene moete in pear kear.
I did not tell him anything.	Ik haw him neat ferteld.
They like to go to the movies.	Se mei graach nei de film gean.
I heard him say that himself.	Dat hearde ik him sels sizzen.
I wish you had told me about this.	Ik woe dat jo my oer dit ferteld hiene.
I could not see anymore.	Ik koe net mear sjen.
That was one.	Dat wie ien.
You take what you can where you can get it.	Jo nimme wat jo kinne wêr't jo it kinne krije.
You do not need any of us.	Jo hawwe net ien fan ús nedich.
That was clear enough.	Dat wie dúdlik genôch.
Let's hope no one else has either.	Lit ús hoopje dat gjinien oars ek hat.
Do not look at me, he thinks.	Sjoch net nei my, tinkt er.
Think about it.	Tink it troch.
And of course, with.	En fansels, mei.
And you too.	En jo ek.
He just thinks it's the best.	Hy tinkt gewoan dat it it bêste is.
The following year, he worked his way back.	It folgjende jier wurke er him werom.
Things were going well.	Dingen wiene der goed út.
You will have us over.	Jo sille ús oer hawwe.
She had just enough money to come home.	Se hie krekt genôch jild om thús te kommen.
Around, kids.	Rûn om, bern.
That always works for me.	Dat wurket altyd foar my.
I just do not know what to get.	Ik wit gewoan net wat ik krije moat.
It will not happen again.	It sil net wer barre.
She was not sure why.	Se wie net wis wêrom.
I was interested in food.	Ik wie ynteressearre yn iten.
I can see this happening one day.	Ik kin sjen dat dit barre ien dei.
If that is the case.	As giet dat wol.
Or both.	Of beide.
I have to leave soon.	Ik moat gau fuort.
There is nothing for us.	Dêr is neat foar ús.
Even to a friend.	Sels nei in freon.
The thing he himself had just said.	It ding dat er sels krekt sein hie.
The boy was alive.	De jonge wie yn libben.
I'm sorry.	It spyt my mar .
I work it through.	Ik wurkje it troch.
That was necessary.	Dat wie nedich.
There was nothing.	Der wie neat.
I also know what the bad is tired.	Ik wit ek wat de min wurch is.
No one needs to worry about them, he told me.	Nimmen hoecht har soargen te meitsjen, sei er tsjin my.
Then again, they do.	Dan wer, se dogge.
But, that will not be enough.	Mar, dat sil net genôch wêze.
Show that you are angry.	Lit sjen dat jo lilk binne.
Not once.	Net ien kear.
Not that it seems that way.	Net dat it der ta liket.
I just wanted to get out of there.	Ik woe der mar út.
Hour after hour he waited.	Oere nei oere wachte er.
I hope we are never like that.	Ik hoopje dat wy noait sa binne.
It would be nice if you do that, actually.	It soe moai wêze as jo dat dogge, eins.
People it's that time again.	Minsken it is wer sa tiid.
Now he looked like an old man.	No like er in âld man.
He knows it's not good for him.	Hy wit dat it net goed foar him is.
That's the way it is.	Dat is de manier fan it.
This works well.	Dit wurket goed.
We do not need much.	Wy hawwe net folle nedich.
You are mine, my girl.	Do bist fan my, myn famke.
He agreed.	Hy die dêr oan mei.
I wish you would never do anything else.	Ik winskje jo noait wat oars te dwaan.
And now this.	En no dit.
A father does not stop her.	In heit hâldt har net tsjin.
Many people were against the plan.	In protte minsken wiene tsjin it plan.
If you want to try it, fine.	As jo ​​​​it besykje wolle, goed.
We know the truth.	Wy witte de wierheid.
But not to each other.	Mar net oan elkoar.
He had to give himself some time before reading it.	Hy moast himsels in bytsje tiid jaan foardat hy it lêzen.
The parents were happy.	De âlden wiene bliid.
Anyone you talk to would say that they were wrong.	Elkenien mei wa't jo prate soene soe sizze dat se dat heul ferkeard hawwe.
He did not see where and how.	Hy seach net wêr en hoe.
But you did it.	Mar do hast it dien.
I think the latter is better.	Ik tink dat lêste is better.
I'm not going now.	Ik gean no net.
We need to do something, and soon!	Wy moatte wat dwaan, en gau!
I will do what is necessary.	Ik sil dwaan wat it nedich is.
The car	De auto
I will agree with what you say.	Ik sil it iens wêze mei wat jo sizze.
He's in here.	Hy is hjir yn.
It was just one.	It wie mar ien.
Someone is coming.	Der komt ien.
Something has gone and something else is in place.	Der is wat gien en wat oars is der op it plak.
Be nice to other people.	Wês aardich foar oare minsken.
Keep away from your mother.	Hâld fuort fan dyn mem.
And don't let them do that anymore.	En lit har dat dan net mear dwaan.
He still has to be here.	Hy moat hjir noch wêze.
This is a very good car.	Dit is in hiel goede auto.
It is also clear.	It is ek dúdlik.
My family was gone.	Myn famylje wie fuort.
I still do it often.	Ik doch it noch faak.
There was one out.	Der wie ien út.
I want to work for you.	Ik wol foar dy wurkje.
Either way, let them do what they want.	Hoe dan ek, lit se dwaan wat se wolle.
That's a difficult one.	Dat is in dreech.
He came alone.	Hy kaam allinnich.
But do not really try.	Mar besykje it net echt.
Was very angry.	Wie tige lilk.
This is about you and me now.	Dit giet no oer dy en my.
And he will work on it at once.	En hy sil der yn ien kear oan wurkje.
The city was not a big city.	De stêd wie gjin grutte stêd.
I never saw her again.	Ik seach har nea wer.
Keep going.	Hâld mar fuort.
It must be there.	It moat der wêze.
They talk again.	Se prate wer.
And they were our two or three against one.	En se wiene ús twa of trije tsjin ien.
He would wake up.	Hy soe wekker wurde.
He arrived.	Hy kaam oan.
You have enough.	Jo hawwe genôch.
He stayed there all day.	Hy bleau dêr de hiele dei.
I said one of us should do something.	Ik sei ien fan ús moat wat dwaan.
The child had no say in the matter.	It bern hie der gjin sizzen oer.
That was fine with me.	Dat wie goed mei my.
No one should.	Nimmen moat.
Otherwise no problem.	Oars gjin probleem.
It has no name.	It hat gjin namme.
We do not think that is good.	Wy tinke net dat dat goed is.
But he could not return.	Mar hy koe net werom.
Can't you come back next year?	Kinne jo takom jier net werom?
There was always someone with him in the room.	Der wie altyd ien by him yn 'e keamer.
Sit and we talk.	Sit en wy prate.
If you do not agree, go for it.	As jo ​​it net iens binne, gean dan fuort fuort.
This is a man who knows how to do things.	Dit is in man dy't wit hoe't dingen dien wurde moatte.
I just tried to get through it, but could not.	Ik besocht der gewoan troch te kommen, mar koe net.
It will take time to get there.	It sil tiid nimme om dêr te kommen.
Work.	Wurk.
Or maybe it was just me.	Of miskien wie it gewoan ik.
Now it's your time.	No is it dyn tiid.
She passed it on to me.	Se joech it oan my troch.
Do not think it can not happen here.	Tink net dat it hjir net barre kin.
He will give it to you.	Hy sil it jo jaan.
I made a new friend.	Ik haw in nije freon makke.
The pain is there.	De sear is der.
I dare not say it.	Ik doar it net te sizzen.
Let me do it.	Lit my it dwaan.
It was his first time.	It wie syn earste kear.
No one can make you.	Nimmen kin dy meitsje.
Maybe the best was yet to come.	Miskien wie it bêste noch te kommen.
But no one found.	Mar gjinien fûn.
The time was bad.	De tiid wie min.
I don't know why.	Ik wit net wêrom.
The boy came around, looking happy with himself.	De jonge kaam om, seach bliid mei himsels.
You just have to make sure it is not easy for him.	Jo moatte gewoan soargje dat it net maklik foar him is.
What happened last night is happening.	Wat der fannacht bard is, bart.
Now this question.	No dizze fraach.
An all or nothing and then again everything.	In alles of neat en dan wer alles.
Dad is too old to come in.	Heit is te âld om yn te kommen.
We do not have to do anything we do not want to do.	Wy hoege neat te dwaan wat wy net wolle.
My father is not happy.	Myn heit is net bliid.
His friend asked what she knew.	Syn freon frege wat se wist.
We can do it where you want.	Wy kinne it dwaan wêr't jo wolle.
He had not thought he would even have one.	Hy hie net tocht dat er sels ien hawwe soe.
Of course, no one will do this.	Fansels sil gjinien dit dwaan.
And for now, that's fine.	En foar no is dat goed.
I've never had a dog.	Ik haw noait in hûn hân.
It must be one or the other.	It moat it ien of it oare wêze.
It's about the only thing that works.	It giet oer it iennichste dat wurket.
I never came out again.	Ik kaam noait wer út.
I just had the time of my life.	Ik hie krekt de tiid fan myn libben.
I knew she would do it.	Ik wist dat se it dwaan soe.
I could not agree more.	Ik koe it net mear iens wêze.
Maybe just not so soon.	Miskien krekt net sa gau.
But they have something to tell us.	Mar se hawwe ús wat te fertellen.
Tell her.	Fertel har.
You are not doing it wrong.	Jo dogge it net ferkeard.
Let me ask you to do this.	Lit my jo freegje dit te dwaan.
He had also gone through her house.	Hy wie ek troch har hûs gien.
It just did not agree with me for some reason.	It wie gewoan net mei my iens om ien of oare reden.
Do nothing else.	Doch neat oars.
I wanted two does this year.	Ik woe twa docht dit jier.
He knows you.	Hy ken dy.
There would be no telling him otherwise.	D'r soe him oars net fertelle.
Maybe we should try it.	Miskien moatte wy it besykje.
That should help a lot.	Dat soe in protte helpe moatte.
I do not want you to go.	Ik wol net dat jo geane.
And he knows nothing now.	En hy wit no neat.
They stay in it well for a month.	Se bliuwe der wol in moanne goed yn.
There's nothing you can do about it.	D'r is neat dat jo dwaan kinne.
It does not matter to us who you are or what you believe.	It makket ús net út wa't jo binne of wat jo leauwe.
I've not been there.	Ik bin der net west.
Hope someone can help me.	Hoopje dat immen my kin helpe.
The man was with another woman.	De man wie by in oare frou.
I'll not go through that again.	Dat gean ik net wer troch.
Now, the first day, no one came.	No, de earste dei, kaam der gjinien.
I did nothing to my family.	Ik haw myn famylje neat dien.
You can not return.	Jo kinne net werom.
He has been good.	Hy hat goed west.
To be happy.	Om bliid te wêzen.
I really hope he does well.	Ik hoopje echt dat hy it goed docht.
We tried to be him.	Wy hawwe besocht him te wêzen.
We can not let that happen.	Dat kinne wy ​​net barre litte.
They were a good couple.	Se wiene in goed pear.
We have hardly seen it.	Wy ha it hast net sjoen.
I'll be fine.	Ik sil goed komme.
Try this for size.	Besykje dit foar grutte.
They are good, but they get old very quickly.	Se binne goed, mar se wurde hiel gau âld.
That's what they say.	Dat sizze se.
Not more than a few years old.	Net mear as in pear jier âld.
If only she knew, she would not.	Net as se dit wist, soe se net.
I felt almost happy for him.	Ik fielde my hast bliid foar him.
But he did not, never could.	Mar hy die net, koe noait.
Which is fine with me.	Wat is goed mei my.
My wife could not do it without her.	Myn frou koe it net sûnder har meitsje.
She was very worried.	Se wie tige soargen.
If you do not like it, you have no chance.	As jo ​​net leuk, do hast gjin kâns.
Your friends still need you.	Jo freonen hawwe jo noch altyd nedich.
Let no one tell you otherwise.	Lit nimmen dy oars fertelle.
I'm happy today.	Ik bin hjoed bliid.
There were things to do.	Der wiene dingen te dwaan.
What a couple.	Wat in pear.
But there is something else.	Mar der is wat oars.
There was a lot of talk.	Der wie in protte praat.
But no one there knows him.	Mar dêr ken gjinien him.
You heard me.	Do hearde my.
It's like you're actually in there.	It is as bist der eins yn.
Without this he will not be afraid.	Sûnder dit sil hy net bang wêze.
But there is no one who does everything.	Mar d'r is gjinien dy't alles docht.
If this was just the first of many.	As dit wie krekt de earste fan in protte.
It would be his last week.	It soe syn lêste wike wêze.
That's what it does for us friends this week.	Dat docht it foar ús dizze wike freonen.
I'm here for the first time.	Ik bin hjir foar it earst.
Well, it can not be otherwise and it probably does not matter.	No, it kin net oars en it makket wierskynlik net út.
That's it.	Dat is dat.
Goes into a large bowl.	Giet yn in grutte kom.
But he knew little of it.	Mar hy wist der min fan.
But we knew water.	Mar wy wisten wetter.
As long as we were together, he was happy.	Sa lang as wy wiene tegearre, hy wie bliid.
But not about how to get there.	Mar net oer hoe te krijen dêr.
There must have been something she was looking at me for.	Der wie wol wat dat se nei my seach.
Not much.	Net folle.
It's hard for you.	It is dreech foar jo.
I think this is what's coming.	Ik tink dat dit is wat der komt.
Do not visit me again.	Besykje my net mear.
She looked at herself.	Se seach se sels oan.
Of course he was not, I would say.	Fansels wie hy net, soe ik sizze.
I saw a good movie a few weeks ago.	Ik seach in goede film in pear wike lyn.
They are still friends.	Noch altyd binne se freonen.
She did not expect me to stay.	Se hie net ferwachte dat ik bliuwe soe.
I didn't.	Ik haw net.
I did not start, she did not start.	Ik bin der net oan begûn, se is der net oan begûn.
I wish things would be different.	Ik winskje dingen soe wêze oars.
To get better now.	Om no better te wurden.
Two words for you.	Twa wurden foar dy.
This should never have happened.	Dit hie nea komme moatten.
I just want her to get well.	Ik wol gewoan dat se goed wurdt.
He would be her husband.	Hy soe har man wêze.
That was two years ago.	Dat wie twa jier lyn.
I was against it.	Ik wie der tsjin.
And maybe much more.	En miskien noch folle mear.
Is anyone sick in this family?	Is immen siik yn dizze famylje?
Not that month.	Net dy moanne.
He took the other with him.	Hy naam de oare mei.
What would happen would happen here.	Wat der barre soe soe hjir barre.
We know it can be done.	Wy witte dat it kin dien wurde.
It happens, of course.	It bart, fansels.
You should have finished your work by now.	Do hiest dyn wurk no klear moatten.
I could see he was home.	Ik koe sjen dat er thús wie.
Now, he told us, was the time to talk.	No, fertelde hy ús, wie de tiid om te praten.
Who knows it does not speak.	Dy't it wit net praat.
Fill me, give me this with him, give me everything.	Folle my, joech my dit mei him, joech my alles.
The woman has never been seen again.	De frou is nea wer sjoen.
And there was none.	En der wie gjinien.
It's talking to you that makes me sick.	It is mei dy prate dat my siik makket.
I had gone to school in another city.	Ik hie nei skoalle gien yn in oare stêd.
That worked well.	Dat wurke goed.
But of course it is not true.	Mar fansels is it net wier.
Do as much as you can.	Doch safolle as jo kinne.
On the same day.	Op deselde dei.
He would not be there.	Hy soe der net by wêze.
He told me he was tired.	Hy fertelde my dat er wurch wie.
They do a lot.	Se die in protte.
A good book is easy to read.	In goed boek is maklik te lêzen.
And he knew mine.	En hy koe myn.
This is not his way.	Dit is net syn manier.
I saw it.	Ik seach it.
I hope everything works out for you.	Ik hoopje dat alles foar jo wurket.
The latter is enough.	De lêste is genôch.
She often has to stay home.	Se moat faak thús bliuwe.
If none of it is real.	As neat fan it is echt.
Before and after two years old.	Foar en nei twa jier âld.
I liked it so much.	Ik mocht it sa leuk meitsje.
We were the only other couple there.	Wy wiene de ienige oare pear dêr.
They know we're here.	Se witte dat wy hjir binne.
There is no way out.	Der is gjin wei út.
But the man is fine.	Mar de man is goed.
I just did not know it as a child.	Ik wist it gewoan net as bern.
It was not my favorite.	It wie net myn favorite.
He wanted me to stay.	Hy woe my bliuwe.
She let him help her on the animal.	Se liet him har op it bist helpe.
If you'm not sure, do not do it.	As jo ​​net wis binne, doch it net.
She just said what she thought.	Se sei gewoan wat se tocht.
I may be wrong about that.	Dêr kin ik ferkeard yn wêze.
It was what they needed.	It wie wat se nedich wiene.
I think this may be the reason.	Ik tink dat dit de reden kin wêze.
You do not care about these people.	Jo hoege jo net oer dizze minsken.
You want to take your time.	Jo wolle jo tiid nimme.
The people are different.	De minsken binne oars.
It is very clear.	It is hiel dúdlik.
It's a good idea if it's one you like.	It is in goed idee as it ien is dy't jo leuk fine.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
I've been here.	Ik bin hjir west.
We are best friends.	Wy binne bêste freonen.
I'm taking you.	Ik nim dy.
No one knew where they were.	Nimmen wist wêr't se wiene.
If he's good, he's really good.	As hy goed is, is hy echt goed.
He lived with us, walked with us, talked with us.	Hy wenne by ús, rûn mei ús, praat mei ús.
But enough is enough.	Mar genôch is genôch.
It's been fun for a while.	It hat west leuk wat wat.
We did last night.	Wy diene fannacht.
I think we did.	Ik tink dat wy diene.
There needs to be more of it.	Der moatte der mear fan wêze.
He got them first.	Hy krige se earst.
Many children never go to school.	In protte bern geane noait nei skoalle.
One of so many like it.	Ien fan safolle like it.
They have no idea what to do.	Se hawwe gjin idee wat te dwaan.
Maybe it was the best he didn’t have.	Miskien wie it it bêste dat er net hie.
It is very much not enough.	It is hiel folle net genôch.
They say something.	Se sizze wat.
My question is.	Myn fraach is.
We should probably go.	Wy moatte wierskynlik gean.
What about this photo?	Hoe sit it mei dizze foto?
But this time, things were a little different.	Mar dizze kear wiene dingen in bytsje oars.
I did not like the office much.	Ik fûn it kantoar net folle leuk.
Maybe they have no idea what your day is like.	Miskien hawwe se gjin idee hoe't jo dei is.
You are not in your right place, he says.	Do bist net op dyn goede plak, seit er.
Earlier than he had expected, too.	Earder as er ferwachte hie, ek.
But he is not gone.	Mar hy is net fuort.
But he could not do it himself.	Mar hy koe it sels net.
He never told us he had a family.	Hy hat ús noait ferteld dat hy in famylje hie.
They just go on and on doing what they want.	Se geane gewoan troch en dogge wat se wolle.
Lots of that here.	In protte fan dat hjir.
He had never done it in his life.	Hy hie it yn syn libben noch noait dien.
Let him.	Lit him.
We just do not go together.	Wy geane gewoan net tegearre.
I was not at first.	Ik wie it earst net.
And he knew it would.	En hy wist wol.
They seemed to see everything.	Se like alles te sjen.
You have been a great help.	Jo hawwe in grutte help west.
What it is I am.	Wat dit ek is.
Wait right here.	Wachtsje hjir krekt.
I can not tell you much.	Ik kin dy net folle fertelle.
He persuaded her to go along.	Hy oertsjûge har om mei te gean.
I do not know why, exactly.	Ik wit net wêrom, krekt.
I doubt it would be anything good.	Ik twifelje oan dat it wat goed wêze soe.
This girl wants everything.	Dit famke wol alles.
We will be together next year.	Wy sille takom jier tegearre wêze.
It just would not have happened.	It soe gewoan net bard wêze.
Two more.	Noch twa.
I'm your friend	ik bin dyn freon
His father was long gone.	Syn heit wie lang fuort.
It does not suit him well.	It sit him net goed.
That could win it well.	Dat koe it wol winne.
I had better not go.	Ik hie better net gean.
I no longer know what to believe.	Ik wit net mear wat ik leauwe moat.
But she has a problem.	Mar se hat in probleem.
It was much better.	It wie folle better.
Everyone wants to know.	Elkenien wol it witte.
She thought of her children.	Se tocht oan har bern.
The police are careful.	De plysje is foarsichtich.
None of these things are bad things in any way.	Gjin fan dizze dingen binne minne dingen op ien of oare manier.
I think it was never made.	Ik tink dat it noait makke is.
I should have told you that at dinner.	Ik hie it dy by it iten sizze moatten.
I wanted better for him.	Ik woe better foar him.
Go away from the door, please.	Gean fuort fan 'e doar, asjebleaft.
Can't wait to see you.	Kin net wachtsje om dy te sjen.
He had to like her.	Hy moast har leuk fine.
Is clear enough.	Is dúdlik genôch.
I just did not know exactly what she was doing.	Ik wist gewoan net krekt wat se die.
It was probably better this way.	It wie wierskynlik better op dizze manier.
Do not worry too much about the money.	Meitsje jo net te folle soargen oer it jild.
The reason became clear.	De reden waard dúdlik.
There was something different about her.	Der wie wat oars oan har.
To be so open about everything.	Om sa iepen te wêzen oer alles.
Well then, tell me.	No dan, fertel my.
He does the best he can.	Hy docht it bêste dat er kin.
Just get them started for you.	Krekt krije har begûn foar dy.
I do not know where he is.	Ik wit net wêr't er is.
He is what we need.	Hy is wat wy nedich hawwe.
But not mine.	Mar net myn.
His friends joined in.	Syn freonen diene mei.
He should have been back now.	Hy hie no werom wêze moatten.
We talked to him about that.	Dêr ha wy him fan praat.
Well, that was much more than the truth.	No, dat wie folle mear as de wierheid.
You will regret it.	Jo sille it spyt hawwe.
Want to see what it's like?	Wolle jo sjen hoe't it is?
That woman was a different person.	Dy frou wie in oare persoan.
Always had it.	Altyd hie it.
It only hurts a little.	It docht mar in bytsje sear.
We also had no place for it.	Wy hiene der ek gjin plak foar.
Believe me.	Leau my mar.
It was clear she was tired.	It wie dúdlik dat se wurch wie.
He really did it for his family.	Hy die it echt foar syn famylje.
But would not say, can not say.	Mar soe net sizze, kin net sizze.
Great man so.	Grutte man sa.
He wants back.	Hy wol werom.
We have to go tonight.	Wy moatte fannacht gean.
You are among friends.	Jo binne ûnder freonen.
Be angry with me.	Wês lilk op my.
I did not ask him.	Ik frege him net.
We need to talk about them.	Wy moatte oer har prate.
When done, enter the room.	As dat dien is, gean de keamer yn.
Last year is a very, very long way to go.	Ferline jier is in hiel, hiel lang wei.
He made the work.	Hy makke it wurk.
And mine too.	En myn ek.
But this is our mother.	Mar dit is ús mem.
We have had enough of that.	Dêr hawwe wy genôch fan.
So ready for me.	Sa klear foar my.
And then our friends are good to us.	En dan binne ús freonen goed foar ús.
There's someone who wants to talk to you.	Der is ien dy't mei dy prate wol.
We will be ready.	Wy sille klear wêze.
But this may not be enough.	Mar dit kin net genôch wêze.
He wanted to know what it was.	Hy woe witte wat it wie.
Come home with me.	Kom mei my thús.
What do you think we can do?	Wat tinke jo dat wy kinne dwaan?
She looked at the boy.	Se seach de jonge oan.
You said it just right.	Jo seine it krekt goed.
Nobody had anything to say.	Nimmen hie wat te sizzen.
I actually totally disagree with him.	Ik bin it eins net hielendal mei him iens.
We have done a lot today.	Wy hawwe hjoed in protte dien.
The boy, who knew nothing, would have nothing to say to anyone.	De jonge, dy't neat wist, soe dêr neat oan nimmen te fertellen hawwe.
Too late again.	Wer te let.
I know he knew.	Ik wit dat hy wist.
This too would be wrong.	Ek dit soe ferkeard wêze.
It even happened to me.	It barde sels my.
There was no time for that.	Dêr wie gjin tiid foar.
I'm at work, so little.	Ik bin oan it wurk, sa'n bytsje.
She looked at the bed.	Se seach nei it bêd.
I did not want to tell him.	Ik woe it him net fertelle.
It makes me very excited !.	It makket my tige sjoen!.
It seems clear that they have.	It liket dúdlik dat se hawwe.
And she had no idea what she was feeling.	En se hie gjin idee wat se fielde.
I knew what they were.	Ik wist wat se wiene.
How long can you go without water?	Hoe lang kinne jo gean sûnder wetter?
I did not want to put the child through it.	Ik woe it bern der net troch sette.
Now we do not know it anymore.	No witte wy it net mear.
I know that well enough.	Dat wit ik goed genôch.
My kids need me.	Myn bern hawwe my nedich.
Makes you win.	Makket jo winne.
If you can help.	As jo ​​kinne helpe.
Am fine.	Giet goed.
I do not.	ik net .
He did it to make money.	Hy die it om jild te meitsjen.
He had been waiting for her.	Hy hie oer har wachte.
I was a little scared.	Ik wie in bytsje bang.
That's a real problem now.	Dat is no in echt probleem.
My whole family.	Myn hiele famylje.
There should have been more.	Der hie mear wêze moatten.
It was forever.	It wie foar altyd.
Do this, that, or the other.	Doch dit, dat, of it oare.
We will not wait.	Wy sille net wachtsje.
And someone did.	En immen die.
No one has seen her.	Nimmen hat har sjoen.
I waited a long time for him.	Ik wachte lang op him.
I love that kid.	Ik hâld fan dat bern.
But that was not it either.	Mar dat wie it ek net.
We should not do this.	Wy moatte dit net dwaan.
I take them off.	Ik doch se út.
I really do not believe in this kind of thing.	Ik leau echt net yn dit soarte dingen.
So far he has too.	Oant no ta hat er ek.
I still remember I was tired.	Ik wit noch dat ik wurch wie.
I wanted to show everyone.	Ik woe elkenien sjen litte.
I could take it.	Ik koe it nimme.
I did not know how it would work here.	Ik wist net hoe't it hjir wurkje soe.
Or maybe something was.	Of miskien wat ding wie.
That's just her way, is everything.	Dat is gewoan har manier, is alles.
They seem to be.	Se lykje te wêzen.
In fact, she did not know what it was.	Eins wist se net wat dit wie.
We can do something about it.	Wy kinne der wat oan dwaan.
It will give us more time together.	It sil ús mear tiid tegearre jaan.
This is not fun.	Dit is net leuk.
And not in a good way.	En net op in goede manier.
You find that there is nothing to worry about.	Jo fine dat it neat is om soargen te meitsjen.
I do not know, I do not want to know.	Ik wit it net, ik wol it net witte.
He was probably gone by now, it would be fine.	Hy wie no wierskynlik fuort, it soe goed wêze.
I'm fine with this.	Ik bin goed mei dit.
We did a lot of good things.	Wy diene in protte goede dingen.
You do not, of course.	Jo net, fansels.
The police have it.	De plysje hat it.
I had none of that.	Dêr hie ik neat fan.
There was no better way to say it.	Der wie gjin bettere manier om it te sizzen.
But she knew otherwise. 	Mar se wist oars. 
Well, two could play.	No, twa koene spylje.
They come in.	Se komme yn.
It was more than that, much more.	It wie mear as dat, folle mear.
He did the only thing there was to do.	Hy die it iennichste wat der te dwaan wie.
And in trouble.	En yn de problemen.
I was not at all interested.	Ik wie hielendal net ynteressearre.
I will not get angry.	Ik sil net lilk wurde.
We have become different.	Wy binne oars wurden.
She says she will not go.	Se seit dat se net gean sil.
No way to go under.	Gjin manier om ûnder te gean.
I had never seen him before.	Ik hie him noch noait earder sjoen.
That was not as easy to do as he had thought.	Dat wie net sa maklik te dwaan as er tocht hie.
All three are even completely on their own.	Alle trije binne se sels hielendal op.
The police are coming, he was told.	De plysje komt wol, waard him ferteld.
They can see.	Se kinne sjen.
It's so true.	It is sa wier.
Same idea, really.	Itselde idee, echt.
You really can.	Jo kinne echt.
He was not in it.	Hy wie der net yn.
The work was not done well.	It wurk waard net goed dien.
It's not true.	It is net wier.
What they would not.	Wat se net soene.
Many people were surprised.	In protte minsken wiene ferrast.
I could see he was scared.	Ik koe sjen dat er bang wie.
I could not even get that right.	Dat koe ik net iens goed krije.
And think more about them.	En mear oer har tinke.
She did not seem sure of what to do.	Se like net wis fan wat te dwaan.
I felt.	Ik fielde.
You can probably think.	Jo kinne wierskynlik tinke.
I want to be sure.	Ik wol der wis fan wêze.
But of course there is much more.	Mar der is fansels noch folle mear.
Your husband is in the same city.	Jo man is yn deselde stêd.
I walked her home.	Ik rûn har nei hûs.
They want out.	Se wolle út.
But he had done it right.	Mar hy hie it goed dien.
And you have very good things.	En jo hawwe heul goede dingen.
All that time, you are told, you have gotten it wrong.	Al dy tiid, wurdt jo ferteld, hawwe jo it ferkeard krigen.
She was pretty good at it.	Se wie der aardich goed yn.
And we have them.	En wy hawwe se.
They will not work.	Se sille net wurkje.
I thought you might like it.	Ik tocht dat jo it graach wolle.
Its the net.	Syn die net.
Come with me then.	Kom dan mei.
Nothing had happened.	Der wie neat bard.
He was not alone away.	Hy wie net allinnich fuort.
Why they had everyone after me.	Wêrom se hiene elkenien nei my.
It looks really good on him.	It sjocht him echt goed.
It had been clear to me before.	It wie my earder dúdlik west.
Do not try this.	Besykje dit net.
I do not pay attention.	Ik let der net op.
He went to the city.	Hy is nei de stêd gien.
There is nothing there.	Dêr is neat.
If you like something here, let me know.	As jo ​​hjir wat leuk fine, lit it my dan witte.
This and so much more.	Dit en safolle mear.
She must be thinking of him.	Se moat oan him tinke.
You have to come back with me.	Jo moatte mei my werom komme.
Those are my friends.	Dat binne myn freonen.
Let's go tomorrow.	Litte wy moarn gean.
He still did not have the way he wanted.	Hy hie noch net de wei dy't er woe.
You know, people go through.	Jo witte, minsken geane troch.
I had to make this happen.	Ik moast dit barre.
And no one came to see it.	En nimmen kaam om it te sjen.
And a lot of people.	En in protte minsken.
, you get a pretty good idea of ​​what's going on.	, jo krije in aardich goed idee wat der bart.
I think we need to get that ready.	Ik tink dat wy dat klear meitsje moatte.
But it happens that way.	Mar it bart sa.
I can not wait for more.	Ik kin net wachtsje op mear.
That's not how it works.	Dat is net hoe't it wurket.
Work on it.	Wurkje dêr oan.
You know a lot about me kids, but not enough.	Jo witte in protte oer my bern, mar net genôch.
It was one of those days.	It wie ien fan dy dagen.
You should have seen him.	Do hiest him sjen moatten.
I know how he thinks.	Ik wit hoe't er tinkt.
I want to show you.	Ik wol dy sjen litte.
Please come out.	Kom asjebleaft út.
I asked him if anyone still knew about it.	Ik frege him oft immen der noch fan wist.
It goes under everything.	It giet ûnder alles.
They were sure.	Se wiene wis.
They want to ask me.	Se wolle my freegje.
That was probably enough.	Dat wie wierskynlik genôch.
Go do more of what you like.	Gean mear te dwaan fan wat jo leuk fine.
It's about three months old.	It is sa'n trije moanne âld.
Could not see anyone.	Koe gjinien sjen.
He should be very careful.	Hy soe tige foarsichtich wêze moatte.
And get into the movie.	En yn 'e film komme.
My children no longer want to be with me.	Myn bern wolle net mear by my wêze.
You need to talk to me.	Jo moatte mei my prate.
That was a really good room.	Dat wie in echt goede keamer.
I'm not ready for that right now.	Ik bin der no net klear foar.
I feel nothing.	Ik fiel neat.
She thought it would not be enough.	Se tocht dat it net genôch wêze soe.
He had never seen his father so angry in his life.	Hy hie syn heit noch nea yn syn libben sa lilk sjoen.
They are different from us.	Se binne oars as ús.
He's there all the time.	Hy is der de hiele tiid.
But then again, who knows.	Mar dan wer, wa wit.
They did nothing for them.	Se diene neat foar har.
I'll try.	Ik sil it besykje.
This time, things would be different.	Dizze kear soene dingen oars wêze.
She has class.	Se hat klasse.
She did not want his money.	Se woe syn jild net.
We are very interested in what you have to say.	Wy binne tige ynteressearre yn wat jo te sizzen hawwe.
I think you can do it.	Ik tink dat jo it kinne.
I made it to work.	Ik makke it oan it wurk.
It probably had to be said.	It moast wierskynlik sein wurde.
I know you want to get to work.	Ik wit dat jo oan it wurk wolle.
He needed her there and he would have her there.	Hy hie har dêr nedich en hy soe har dêr hawwe.
Whoever took it must give it back.	Wa't it naam, moat it werom jaan.
I know he's in there.	Ik wit dat hy der yn is.
We need to do both.	Wy moatte beide dwaan.
I did not ask her.	Ik haw har net frege.
I just do not believe you are ready to give him up.	Ik leau gewoan net dat jo ree binne om him op te jaan.
Of course I was not.	Dat wie ik fansels net.
Even then, she will have no idea where you have gone.	Sels dan sil se gjin idee hawwe wêr't jo hinne gien binne.
I never went there.	Ik ha der noait ôf gien.
She worked hard.	Se wurke hurd.
He was nice to us.	Hy wie aardich foar ús.
He knows we want him back.	Hy wit dat wy him werom wolle.
I'll tell you what they did.	Ik sil dy fertelle wat se dien hawwe.
His hair was long.	Syn hier wie lang.
But he asked to see the children.	Mar hy frege om de bern te sjen.
I'm not coming back.	Ik kom net werom.
I do not even think about it.	Ik tink der net iens oer nei.
That can not be true!	Dat kin net wier wêze!
And, let me be clear.	En, lit my dúdlik wêze.
But only still.	Mar allinnich noch.
I let this happen.	Ik lit dit barre.
And that's the.	En dat die se.
You would really like it.	Jo soene der tige fan hâlde wolle.
That's how we surprise them.	Dat is hoe't wy se ferrast.
I accept it.	Ik nim it oan.
Things will never be the same.	Dingen sille nea wêze itselde.
This is different.	Dit is oars.
He knows no worries.	Hy wit gjin soargen.
It could happen.	It koe barre.
He wanted us.	Hy woe ús hawwe.
If we ever did.	As wy oait dien hawwe.
But it's too late for that.	Mar dêr is it te let foar.
It's hard to make out what it says.	It is dreech om út te meitsjen wat it seit.
I would like to know who she thinks did this.	Ik soe graach witte wa't se tinke dat dit dien hat.
I like this.	Dit kin ik wol leuk fine.
And there is simply no one.	En d'r is gewoan net ien.
That's exactly what's happening.	Dat is krekt wat bart.
They are all really good friends.	Se binne allegear echt goede freonen.
Questions are tired.	Fragen binne wurch.
I think it worked well.	Ik tink dat it goed wurke.
You can help me here.	Jo kinne my hjir helpe.
It seemed like the right thing to do.	It like it goede ding om te dwaan.
Let's put them back to work now.	Litte wy se no wer oan it wurk sette.
He saw no other person.	Hy seach gjin oare persoan.
She knows what is good for her.	Se wit wat goed foar har is.
No reason why they should.	Gjin reden wêrom't se moatte.
Rather not so easy.	Earder net sa maklik.
Nothing was found.	Der waard neat fûn fûn.
And you're here.	En do bist hjir.
They come back about a bit.	Se komme oer in bytsje werom.
My dog ​​eats better than many people.	Myn hûn yt better as in protte minsken.
She still had it on.	Se hie it noch op.
What is that.	Wat is dat.
It is in her name.	It stiet op har namme.
I have to stop.	Ik moat ophâlde.
Many things happened today.	In protte dingen barde hjoed.
And your parents.	En dyn âlden.
It had to be the same.	It moast itselde wêze.
You have to be different.	Jo moatte oars wêze.
I was her friend, but she gave nothing.	Ik wie har freon, mar se joech neat.
He could see me coming back out.	Hy koe sjen my komme werom út.
She needed hope to keep her going.	Se hie hope nedich om har te hâlden.
That does not matter.	Dat makket neat út.
I had no idea what was going to happen.	Ik hie gjin idee wat der barre soe.
He's not happy.	Hy is net bliid.
To the last day of his life he wants to.	Oan de lêste dei fan syn libben wol er.
You have good friends here.	Jo hawwe hjir goede freonen.
And no one needs to grow old if they do not want to.	En nimmen hoecht âld te wurden as se dat net wolle.
Still, she could do nothing to stop her.	Noch altyd koe se neat dwaan om har tsjin te hâlden.
I wanted them on my more than anything.	Ik woe se op myn mear as wat.
She told them about her day.	Se fertelde har oer har dei.
She will never talk to you again.	Se sil noait wer mei dy prate.
Do what you have to.	Doch wat jo moatte.
It's still real today.	It is hjoed noch echt.
Maybe that was the problem.	Miskien wie dat it probleem.
And then there was the last time.	En dan wie der de lêste kear.
This is fun.	Dit is leuk.
Just tell her you only need a few hours.	Fertel har gewoan dat jo it mar in pear oeren nedich binne.
He was not interested at first.	Hy wie earst net ynteressearre.
She needs some help.	Se hat wat help nedich.
Those two things were not the same.	Dy twa dingen wiene net itselde.
That is no longer true.	Dat is net mear wier.
Do not care about us.	Jou net iens om ús.
Now they were free.	No wiene se frij.
And now there is no food in the house.	En no is der gjin iten yn 'e hûs.
Water is necessary for life.	Wetter is nedich foar it libben.
You keep away.	Jo hâlde fuort.
A good chance.	In goede kâns.
He said he had heard something.	Hy sei dat er wat heard hie.
She looked so alone.	Se seach sa allinnich.
If he could not have them.	As er har net hawwe koe.
That's good.	Dat is goed.
I also do not think you need it.	Ik tink ek net dat jo it nedich hawwe.
I know that better than he can.	Ik kin dat better as hy kin.
I picked it up.	Ik naam it op.
I'm not going away at all.	Ik gean net hielendal fuort.
There are not enough.	Der binne net genôch.
You did this, he said.	Jo hawwe dit dien, sei er.
She was worried.	Se wie soargen.
He agreed with me.	Hy wie it mei my iens.
White on white on white.	Wit op wit op wit.
Well, let's see.	No, lit ús sjen.
It's almost three o'clock.	It is hast trije oere.
It's home to us.	It is thús foar ús.
Everyone loved them.	Elkenien hie der fan har hâlden.
Clearly he did not know much about children.	Dúdlik wist er net folle fan bern.
Here is someone who will help you.	Hjir is ien dy't jo helpe sil.
I've seen it myself.	Ik haw it sels sjoen.
Whether it would be found or not, but here.	Of it soe fûn wurde of net, mar hjir.
They met her, once, a few years ago.	Se moete har, ien kear, in pear jier lyn.
That will not be possible.	Dat sil net kinne.
Quite a bit of time.	Hiel wat tiid.
I never read it again.	Ik haw it noait wer lêzen.
Everyone looks at this and that.	Elkenien sjocht nei dit en dat.
I had something to eat.	Ik hie wat te iten.
It was a first for me.	It wie in earste foar my.
I was wrong again.	Ik wie wer ferkeard.
He was good at what he did.	Hy wie goed yn wat er die.
He had made her.	Hy hie har makke.
This was my house for two years, just mine.	Dit wie myn hûs foar twa jier, gewoan myn.
The police saw him.	De plysje seach him.
Tell her what we know so far.	Fertel har wat wy oant no ta witte.
I do not know her.	Ik ken har net.
You have to be different.	Jo moatte oars wêze.
She knows you're coming.	Se wit dat jo komme.
Very few people know this.	Hiel pear minsken witte dit.
He's late.	Hy komt te let.
He is very good at what he does.	Hy is heul goed yn wat hy docht.
A person or thing that.	In persoan of ding dat.
You will never see her again, do not worry about it.	Jo sille har noait wer sjen, meitsje jo der gjin soargen oer.
This is what makes it so difficult.	Dit is wat it sa dreech makket.
These no longer occur.	Dy komme net mear foar.
I want to work on it.	Ik wol der oan wurkje.
The two are not one and the same.	De twa binne net ien en itselde.
Are you sure for them to do this.	Binne jo wis foar har dogge dit.
The city is many things.	De stêd is in protte dingen.
They have none.	Se hawwe gjin.
And much more out there for sure.	En folle mear út dêr foar wis.
It's the same for everyone.	It is itselde foar elkenien.
This person is not the person who came through the door.	Dizze persoan is net de persoan dy't troch de doar kaam.
The boy looked around.	De jonge seach om him hinne.
Be careful what you wish for!	Wês foarsichtich wat jo winskje!
I think it was not a bad thing in itself.	Ik tink dat it op himsels net in minne wie.
He could tell so much by just looking at her.	Hy koe sa folle fertelle troch gewoan nei har te sjen.
They know who my husband is.	Se witte wa't myn man is.
We have no food left.	Wy hawwe gjin iten mear.
A little talk.	In bytsje praat.
He was not ready.	Hy wie net klear.
But there is, of course, a problem.	Mar der is fansels in probleem.
Somehow you.	Op ien of oare manier jo.
But we will.	Mar wy sille.
You want to ask them.	Jo wolle se freegje.
Your problem must be something else.	Jo probleem moat wat oars wêze.
She's so nice.	Se is sa aardich.
And it does not matter.	En it makket neat út.
Do not be afraid of this idea.	Wês net bang fan dit idee.
Earlier last night something happened and they do not believe me.	Earder fannacht barde der wat en se leauwe my net.
But we were worried.	Mar wy wiene soargen.
But we can see that the time may come.	Mar wy kinne sjen dat de tiid kin komme.
But that is not so.	Mar dat is net sa.
Let's eat!	Litte wy ite!
They could not handle it.	Se koene it net oan.
Why would you want that.	Wêrom soene jo dat wolle.
She looked good.	Se seach der goed út.
I think I was that.	Ik tink dat ik dat wie.
That's what he needs to do.	Dat moat er dwaan.
You know how you can.	Jo witte hoe't jo kinne.
I was worried too.	Ik makke my ek soargen.
And it was still.	En it wie noch.
He was not good.	Hy wie net goed.
I told her nothing had happened.	Ik fertelde har dat der neat bard wie.
Never let them get away from you.	Lit se nea fan dy wei komme.
You just have not seen them.	Jo hawwe se gewoan net sjoen.
Do not come for them.	Kom net foar har.
It just took off.	It naam gewoan ôf.
This was his great opportunity.	Dit wie syn grutte kâns.
Now they know.	No witte se.
We are very busy these days.	Wy binne dizze dagen tige drok.
I never want to worry about money.	Ik wol noait soargen meitsje oer jild.
He's still a man.	Hy is noch in man.
Very often they come first.	Hiel faak komme se earst.
There was nothing to do.	Der wie neat te dwaan.
There was no way around it.	Der wie gjin wei om it hinne.
We are just different.	Wy binne gewoan oars.
He is our only child.	Hy is ús iennichste bern.
Well, this is where you need to take them.	No, dit is wêr't jo se moatte nimme.
They serve it.	Se diene dit.
I do none of that.	Dêr doch ik neat fan.
They do not go away.	Se geane net fuort.
But here it is very different.	Mar hjir is it hiel oars.
There was this other one.	Dêr wie dizze oare.
I went last night.	Ik gie fannacht.
Since last year.	Sûnt ferline jier.
She knows exactly what to do.	Se wit krekt wat te dwaan.
That's not nothing.	Dat is net neat.
His friends talk well about him.	Syn freonen prate goed oer him.
We did not know how many children we had.	Wy wisten net hoefolle bern wy hiene.
You can just become much more.	Jo kinne gewoan folle mear wurden.
She had never looked around.	Se hie noait om har hinne sjoen.
It was a man.	It wie in man.
That's better for you.	Dat is better foar dy.
I'm angry about everything!	Ik bin lilk oer alles!
Not enough good people.	Net genôch goede minsken.
The water went over me.	It wetter gie oer my hinne.
asked the woman.	frege de frou.
They want to go home.	Se wolle nei hûs.
Not to mention your new husband.	Net te hawwen oer dyn nije man.
He really is.	Hy is it echt.
I just can not leave now.	Ik kin no gewoan net fuort.
That's the reason.	Dat is de reden.
This book is no different.	Dit boek is net oars.
And good food.	En goed iten.
But other people.	Mar oare minsken.
I look at him and look away.	Ik sjoch him sjen en sjoch fuort.
Would like some things she wanted to buy.	Soe wat dingen dy't se keapje woe.
You can easily do this at home.	Jo kinne dit maklik thús meitsje.
They still do.	Dat diene se noch.
She was glad he could not see her.	Se wie bliid dat er har net sjen koe.
You want the best person for the job.	Jo wolle de bêste persoan foar de baan.
So she stands.	Sa stiet se.
All or something.	Al wat of oars.
Everything else today will talk about him.	Al it oare hjoed sil oer him prate.
She wanted so long so much.	Se woe sa lang sa folle.
To worry about.	Om soargen oer.
The best we can do is try to get it out.	It bêste dat wy kinne dwaan is besykje it út te gean.
He was early.	Hy wie betiid.
He does nothing.	Hy docht neat.
Another one will be totally fine.	Noch ien sil hielendal goed wêze.
This kind of thing should always stay the same.	Dit soarte dingen moatte altyd itselde bliuwe.
I had to make it work.	Ik moast it wurk meitsje.
Probably this thing that happened to her.	Wierskynlik dit ding dat har bard is.
She has enough to worry about these days.	Se hat dizze dagen genôch te soargen oer.
Or bad for you.	Of min foar dy.
Just came to see my father.	Kom krekt om myn heit te sjen.
What she really needed was truth and hope.	Wat se echt nedich wie wierheid en hope.
She did not know if she could do it.	Se wist net oft se it koe.
But there is more to come.	Mar der komt noch mear.
Well, not my mom, of course.	No, myn mem net, fansels.
Almost there now.	Dêr hast no.
Better than those other two, actually.	Better as dy oare twa, eins.
I knew you were coming.	Ik wist dat jo komme soene.
Maybe she still does.	Miskien docht se noch wol.
Never said that to a woman who was not a family before.	Nea sei dat tsjin in frou dy't earder gjin famylje wie.
But we do this.	Mar wy dogge dit.
She works for me.	Se wurket foar my.
But he could see nothing.	Mar hy koe neat sjen.
He did not have to go through.	Hy hoegde net troch te gean.
He had woken them all three.	Hy hie se alle trije wekker makke.
Only it itself is the same.	Allinnich it sels is itselde.
Just love me.	Hâld gewoan fan my.
We'll look after you.	Wy sille nei dy sjen.
It seemed like that would not happen now.	It like der op dat dat no net barre soe.
But, it does not work for me.	Mar, it wurket net foar my.
He does everything.	Hy die alles.
Work began early.	It wurk begûn betiid.
Not many, but a few.	Net in protte, mar in pear.
There was so much to do.	Der wie safolle te dwaan.
That was a good time.	Dat wie in goede tiid.
I look forward to reading it.	Ik sjoch der nei út om it te lêzen.
They were not old.	Se wiene net âld.
I want nothing more to do with this place.	Ik wol neat mear te krijen mei dit plak.
I have to try this way this time.	Ik moat dizze kear dizze manier besykje.
It would be clear.	It soe dúdlik wêze.
With her, it was somehow not.	Mei har wie it op ien of oare manier net.
The problem was the same.	It probleem wie itselde.
I will look at my book again.	Ik sil wer nei myn boek sjen.
That it is wrong.	Dat it ferkeard is.
I know what he wants and needs.	Ik wit wat hy wol en nedich is.
That will give us enough time.	Dat sil ús genôch tiid jaan.
It had to be me who did the talking.	It moast ik wêze dy't it praten die.
Don't worry.	Meitsje dy gjin soargen.
He was not scared, exactly.	Hy wie net bang, krekt.
I feel so for you.	Ik fiel sa foar dy.
Come with me if you want.	Kom mei my as jo wolle.
I did it again.	Ik haw it wer dien.
He could not keep food for a few days.	Hy koe in pear dagen net iten hâlde.
I look at my mother.	Ik sjoch myn mem oan.
Three years in the making.	Trije jier yn it meitsjen.
But my friends need to be there.	Mar myn freonen moatte der wêze.
Well, you know about that.	No, dêr witte jo fan.
Will never see her again.	Wol se noait wer sjen.
You will make many new friends.	Jo sille in protte nije freonen meitsje.
He would never know it now.	Hy soe it no noait witte.
But again, it did not matter.	Mar wer makke it neat út.
I want you to stay here with me.	Ik wol dat jo hjir by my bliuwe.
Children, she said.	Bern, sei se.
Please, show it to us now.	Asjebleaft, jo litte it ús no sjen.
She did not have many friends.	Se hie net folle freonen.
Then in it.	Dan yn it.
Have not been there.	Ha der net west.
He said he could not do it himself.	Hy sei dat er it sels net dwaan koe.
They can do whatever they want.	Se kinne dwaan wat se wolle.
See, we think we're just like her, but we are not.	Sjoch, wy tinke dat wy krekt as har binne, mar wy binne net.
That was pretty good.	Dat wie aardich goed.
Nothing more to do.	Neat mear te dwaan.
She even told me that she liked the new me.	Se fertelde my sels dat se de nije my leuk fûn.
Do they not need more money for more food ?.	Binne se net mear jild nedich foar mear iten?.
His mother had never told him she loved him.	Syn mem hie him nea ferteld dat se fan him hâlde.
Not to you and you.	Net oan dy en dy.
There was no reason why they should.	Der wie gjin reden wêrom't se moatte.
That's what we're working on.	Dat is wêr't wy oan wurkje.
Bad to say.	Min te sizzen.
The boy was angry.	De jonge wie lilk.
Well, one had.	No, ien hie.
No worries.	Gjin soargen.
He became a great teacher.	Hy waard in grutte learaar.
Tomorrow by this time you will know it.	Moarn tsjin dizze tiid sille jo it witte.
I gave up and let it go.	Ik joech op en liet it gean.
She looked around the room.	Se seach de keamer om.
She just wanted to get away from him.	Se woe gewoan fan him ôf.
I'm nothing now.	Ik bin no neat.
Go to class every day.	Gean alle dagen nei de klasse.
It's true, one way or another.	It is wier, ien of oare manier.
And how to get it.	En hoe te krijen it.
Not that much of everything your people do you a lot of good.	Net dat folle fan alles wat jo minsken jo in protte goed dogge.
But it's beautiful.	Mar it is moai.
Keep it up!.	Gean sa troch!.
It did him no good.	It die him net goed.
I hope she comes back soon.	Ik hoopje dat se gau werom komt.
I have not realized that so far.	Dat haw ik oant no ta net realisearre.
That's how it will be, he thought.	Sa sil it wêze, tocht er.
Someone is talking about her father.	Immen praat oer har heit.
You have to do it this way.	Jo moatte it op dizze manier dwaan.
She's my only friend.	Se is myn ienige freon.
On many questions.	Op in protte fragen.
She just wants you to be happy.	Se wol gewoan dat jo bliid wêze.
She walked away from him.	Se rûn by him wei.
But this is your day.	Mar dit is dyn dei.
He got out of there right away.	Hy kaam der fuort út.
I look forward to reading more.	Ik sjoch út nei mear te lêzen.
She is out of work.	Se sit sûnder wurk.
Keep it up.	Hâld it troch.
You can never tell.	Jo kinne noait fertelle.
And this other thing too.	En dit oare ding ek.
They have nothing to do with me.	Se hawwe neat mei my te krijen.
It would not go, of course.	It soe net gean, fansels.
The money should still be there.	It jild moat der noch wêze.
There must be.	Der moat wêze.
Come on, take this here.	Kom op, nim dit hjir.
He was very happy.	Hy wie tige bliid.
He knew what was coming.	Hy wist wat der komme soe.
He does nothing.	Hy docht neat.
He did not anticipate the question.	Hy ferwachte de fraach net.
Whatever it is, it will be good.	Wat it ek is, it sil goed wêze.
But we still do.	Mar dat dogge wy noch.
His mother is angry at him.	Syn mem is lilk op him.
It was something else.	It wie wat oars.
Would you like to lend us a hand, please?	Wolle jo ús in hân jaan, asjebleaft?
He had to tell him.	Hy moast it him fertelle.
I ask her name.	Ik freegje har namme.
I did not even know what to say.	Ik wist net iens wat ik sizze moast.
I know my father was there.	Ik wit dat myn heit der wie.
I did not know what happened.	Ik wist net wat der barde.
There was just never the right time.	Der wie gewoan nea de goede tiid.
It's a problem.	It is in probleem.
I can not agree.	Ik kin it net iens wêze.
I worked hard.	Ik wurke hurd.
You saw nothing.	Do hast neat sjoen.
No one likes the person who is good at everything.	Nimmen hâldt fan de persoan dy't goed is yn alles.
The kids will love it.	De bern sille it leuk fine.
You can talk to them without even talking.	Jo kinne mei har prate sûnder sels te praten.
You did well, boy.	Do hast it goed dien, jonge.
And there's one more thing.	En d'r is noch ien ding.
She was not at all happy with her life.	Se wie hielendal net bliid mei har libben.
For one thing, there are still many good things happening.	Foar ien ding, der binne noch in protte goede dingen bart.
I kept trying.	Ik bleau besykje.
But it was really more so.	Mar it wie echt mear sa.
If you do not have it, you will not know it until you get there.	As jo ​​​​dat net hawwe, sille jo it net witte oant jo dêr komme.
There were two.	It wiene twa.
His latest book.	Syn lêste boek.
I saw you did it for her.	Ik seach dat jo it foar har diene.
Maybe that's the reason.	Miskien is dat de reden.
She never gave up.	Se joech noait op.
And neither do we.	En wy ek net.
How many, they did not know yet.	Hoefolle, wisten se noch net.
The mother left her three children alone at home.	De mem liet har trije bern allinnich thús.
No one will ever know about this.	Gjinien sil ea witte oer dit.
Not sure why it does not work now.	Net wis wêrom't it no net wurket.
My home away from home.	Myn thús fuort fan hûs.
You need to get going right away.	Jo moatte fuort fuort.
He had just turned thirty.	Hy wie krekt tritich wurden.
He saw this.	Hy seach dizze.
It was not too late.	It wie net te let.
They were really good at it.	Se wiene der echt goed yn.
It was angry.	It wie lilk.
He has hurt people before and liked it.	Hy hat minsken earder sear dien en fûn it leuk.
Another father returned from work.	In oare heit kaam werom fan it wurk.
It was under the bed.	It wie ûnder it bêd.
But they should not have.	Mar se moatte net hawwe.
Here again, it's the same idea.	Hjir wer, it is itselde idee.
He's nice.	Hy is leuk.
There must be something first, something last.	Der moat earst wat komme, wat lêste.
He's not a good man.	Hy is gjin goed man.
That's my girl.	Dat is myn famke.
It's hard to find the best of them.	It is dreech om de bêste fan har te finen.
I doubt anyone will.	Ik twifelje dat immen sil.
I heard what you did.	Ik hearde wat jo dien hawwe.
See if anything comes of it.	Sjoch as der wat fan komt.
We just had one thing.	Wy hiene krekt in ding.
He felt nothing.	Hy fielde neat.
Everything was ready.	Alles wie klear.
As a man.	As in man.
It works really well.	It wurket echt goed.
I worked very hard to finish the job.	Ik wurke heul hurd om it wurk ôf te meitsjen.
The family will be there.	De famylje sil der wêze.
It was just one.	It wie mar ien.
He knew he had to get out of that water.	Hy wist dat er út dat wetter komme moast.
We can make it bad for you.	Wy kinne meitsje it min foar dy.
His friends were always happy with him.	Syn freonen wiene altyd graach by him.
It was gone, just like everything else.	It wie fuort, krekt as al it oare.
Together we find him.	Tegearre fine wy ​​him.
It was just beautiful.	It wie gewoan moai.
I'm just asking you to see.	Ik freegje jo gewoan om te sjen.
People ask how they can do it too.	Minsken freegje hoe't se it ek kinne.
He was sure he would get the job.	Hy wie der wis fan dat hy de baan krije soe.
You will never get it.	Jo sille it noait krije.
Get the best out of your food.	It bêste fan jo iten krije.
Not as a girl.	Net as famke.
I had no family.	Ik hie gjin famylje.
You can not do much about it.	Jo kinne der net folle oan dwaan.
So glad to see you!	Sa bliid om dy te sjen!
But also here.	Mar ek hjir.
It was hours before they got them out.	It wie oeren foardat se har út krigen.
He seemed to have nothing there.	Hy like der neat te hawwen.
I know now though.	Ik wit no wol.
They really, really serve.	Se echt, echt diene.
You will love my place.	Jo sille fan myn plak hâlde.
We can work.	Wy kinne wurkje.
She knew what she wanted.	Se wist wat se woe.
I can eat anything.	Ik kin alles ite.
I liked you better if you did not speak.	Ik mocht dy better as jo net prate.
One guy said.	Ien keardel sei.
What a thing to do to a child.	Wat in ding te dwaan oan in bern.
Need it now.	Hat it no nedich.
The thing was, he had no idea if he could.	It ding wie, hy hie gjin idee oft hy koe.
But what if she does not come with me, he thought.	Mar wat as se net mei my komt, tocht er.
And he never came back.	En hy kaam noait werom.
It stands out.	It stiet der út.
That's what I want now.	Dat wol ik no.
He did not seem surprised to see me.	Hy like net ferrast om my te sjen.
I do not think otherwise.	Ik tink net oars.
There are.	Der binne.
For now, he would stay.	Foar no soe er bliuwe.
Plan it now.	Plan it no.
Before she got to bed.	Foardat se op bêd kaam.
It was clear he had more to say.	It wie dúdlik dat er mear te sizzen hie.
That may not be the case for long.	Dat kin net lang sa wêze.
They talk to us all the time.	Se prate de hiele tiid tsjin ús.
It was not as if he did not know it himself.	It wie net oft er it sels net wist.
We need to stop now.	Wy moatte no ophâlde.
My mother did not get better from it.	Myn mem waard der net better fan.
It was not a day yet.	It wie noch gjin dei.
Let me try to finish this.	Lit my besykje dit ôf te meitsjen.
They were ready for that.	Dêr wiene se klear foar.
Now you can do that.	No kinne jo dat dwaan.
I told you about those people, what they did.	Ik fertelde dy oer dy minsken, wat se dien hawwe.
I was all ready to go.	Ik wie allegear klear om te gean.
Okay, tomorrow morning.	Goed, moarn moarn.
You can make as much or as little as you want.	Jo kinne safolle of sa min meitsje as jo wolle.
It was time for everyone to get to work.	It wie tiid foar elkenien om oan it wurk te kommen.
Even then, it will be difficult to take first place.	Sels dan sil it dreech wêze om it earste plak te nimmen.
Of course we do it wrong.	Fansels dogge wy it ferkeard.
It really hit the spot, he told her.	It rekke echt it plak, sei er tsjin har.
I'll pay for something.	Ik sil betelje foar wat.
Do not let them come to you.	Lit se net by jo komme.
That's what we're all about.	Dêr binne wy ​​sa oer.
I have it here.	Ik haw it hjir.
Mom met him.	Mem moete him.
This was not for him.	Dit wie net foar him.
I do not hold a letter for everyone.	Ik hâld gjin brief foar elkenien.
He has never met a friend.	Hy hat nea in freon moete.
He does not let himself be surprised.	Hy lit him net ferrast wurde.
If you want to know more, please ask !.	As jo ​​​​mear witte wolle, freegje jo asjebleaft!.
It worked really well.	It wurke echt goed.
We work on things.	Wy wurkje oan dingen.
I do not agree with what they do.	Ik bin it net iens mei wat se dogge.
I have so much more to give.	Ik haw safolle mear te jaan.
But we will not know if they do not.	Mar wy sille it net witte as se it net dogge.
I shake his hand.	Ik jou him de hân.
Those parents were not your parents.	Dy âlden wiene dyn âlden net.
He is the same.	Hy is itselde.
He could not believe what he had done.	Hy koe net leauwe wat er dien hie.
I really liked that.	Dat fûn ik tige leuk.
It's just beautiful.	It is gewoan moai.
Tell no one what's really going on.	Fertel gjinien wat der echt bart.
I can not see anyone here.	Ik kin hjir net ien sjen.
Everyone walked around.	Elkenien rûn om.
She went home.	Se gie nei hûs.
he said to himself.	sei er tsjin himsels.
And that's exactly the thing.	En dat is krekt it ding.
If you want him, you must come through me.	As jo ​​him wolle, moatte jo troch my komme.
Go do it.	Gean do it.
It would not be enough for everything.	It soe net foar alles genôch wêze.
Three times over.	Trije kear oer.
Ask you.	Freegje dy.
To the parents.	Oan de âlden.
Which was good.	Wat goed wie.
Nobody really talked about it.	Nimmen hie it der echt oer.
Actually, it was not the problem, but it makes me find it.	Eins wie it net it probleem, mar it makket my it te finen.
I do not have a name for her yet.	Ik haw noch gjin namme foar har.
I just thought you might like that too.	Ik tocht krekt dat jo dat ek leuk fine kinne.
It's how things work.	It is hoe't dingen wurkje.
We will do that for you.	Dat sille wy foar jo dwaan.
I wanted it bad.	Ik woe it min.
What it could not be.	Wat it net wêze koe.
He could.	Hy koe wol.
But he has.	Mar hy hat.
It's time for me to go back to work.	It wurdt tiid dat ik wer oan it wurk gean.
Everyone knew about it.	Elkenien wist der fan.
He had come.	Hy wie kommen.
I know there is more than that.	Ik wit dat der mear is dan dat.
To look! 	Sjen!
I love where we are.	Ik hâld fan wêr't wy binne.
He did not even ask where they were going.	Hy frege net iens wêr't se hinne soene.
How do we make good food?	Hoe meitsje wy goed iten?
We never would.	Wy soene noait.
She was ready to leave.	Se wie ree om fuort te gean.
No help from anyone.	Gjin help fan immen.
No one will.	Gjin ien sil.
I would be the first to agree with that.	Ik soe de earste wêze dy't it dêr mei iens wêze soe.
And that has happened in the past.	En dat is yn it ferline bard.
It just does not matter much.	It komt gewoan net folle op.
They have not spoken to each other since.	Se hawwe sûnt net mear mei elkoar praat.
And it's not hard to see that it is.	En it is net dreech om te sjen dat it is.
He was away for almost a year, away from school.	Hy wie hast in jier fuort, fuort op skoalle.
That the children might be different.	Dat de bern miskien oars wêze soene.
And it was pretty fun.	En it wie aardich leuk.
Not many people know anything about this belief.	Net folle minsken witte wat oer dit leauwe.
She did not know what to do or where to go.	Se wist net wat te dwaan of wêr't se hinne moast.
Do not be afraid of him.	Wês net bang foar him.
It's rather true.	It is earder wier.
He will know whether we should tell her or not.	Hy sil witte oft wy it har fertelle moatte of net.
This is how you can do it.	Dit is hoe't jo dit kinne dwaan.
I do not know at first that it is her.	Ik wit earst net dat it har is.
I came here to talk about myself.	Ik kaam hjir om oer my te praten.
The first letter.	De earste brief.
Just started going for it.	Krekt begûn te gean foar it.
He does not want to leave.	Hy wol net fuort.
How long they do not know.	Hoe lang witte se net.
It was real.	It wie echt.
I told the woman it was you.	Ik fertelde de frou dat it jo wiene.
I never heard from him.	Ik hearde nea fan him.
Maybe you yourself.	Miskien do sels.
He always does.	Hy altyd docht.
I bought another one.	Ik kocht noch ien.
Not so long ago this place was under water.	Net sa lang lyn wie dit plak ûnder wetter.
Many almost.	In protte hast.
And now he was gone.	En no wie er fuort.
She was angry.	Se wie lilk.
We eat it.	Wy ite it.
He did not ask.	Hy frege net.
And even more.	En noch mear.
Hurt him.	Doch him sear.
But he was not there.	Mar hy wie der net.
I really do not want to see the book again.	Ik wol it boek eins net wer sjen.
You did it.	Do hast it dien.
I have nothing to do with that.	Dêr haw ik neat om.
You were both there, and you both know it.	Jo wiene der beide, en jo witte it beide.
Their food is not enough.	Har iten is net genôch.
Just get in there.	Kom der mar yn.
So he thought she was beautiful.	Sa tocht er dat se moai wie.
Come to me, tonight.	Kom nei my, fannacht.
Good so far.	Goed oant no ta.
And this is not much.	En dit is net folle.
Think about what they might be planning.	Tink oan wat se miskien fan plan binne.
I showed the kids to him too.	Ik liet de bern him ek sjen.
Maybe not forever.	Miskien net foar altyd.
They are very good.	Se binne hiel goed.
But she did not say that.	Mar dat sei se net.
But not until then.	Mar net oant dan.
Not at once of course.	Net yn ien kear fansels.
It looks like money.	It liket jild.
I did it right.	Ik die it goed.
As can be.	As kin wêze.
I'm not looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der net nei út.
That's a bad idea for me.	Dat is foar my in min idee.
And that's what we're talking about.	En dêr hawwe wy it oer.
Take care of it now.	Soargje der no foar.
You can be the same.	Jo kinne itselde wêze.
I know a lot of people.	Ik ken in protte minsken.
He did not convince me.	Hy oertsjûge my net.
But for good reason.	Mar foar goede reden.
Let's do this together.	Litte wy dit tegearre dwaan.
I will not tell.	Ik sil it net fertelle.
No one is sure.	Nimmen is wis.
We better get going soon, he said.	Wy moatte better gau gean, sei er.
But I can not.	Mar ik kin net.
And that was exactly it.	En dat wie krekt.
One day he just walked away.	Op in dei gie er gewoan fuort.
Not after the last time he did that.	Net nei de lêste kear dat er dat dien hie.
To say the best.	Om it goede te sizzen.
I enter the house.	Ik gean it hûs yn.
He handed it over to her.	Hy joech it har oer.
They live in the city.	Se wenje yn 'e stêd.
Or maybe it can, but not tonight.	Of miskien kin it, mar fannacht net.
That happened two or three times.	Dat barde twa of trije kear.
Make them necessary.	Meitsje se nedich.
He knew a lot.	Hy wist in protte.
Talk it out with someone.	Praat it út mei immen.
What to see was like nothing else.	Wat te sjen wie like neat oars.
He did not feel it at all.	Hy fielde him hielendal net.
He just came.	Hy kaam net.
You know it too.	Jo witte it ek.
I had to go back.	Ik moast werom.
I would give my life for her.	Ik soe myn libben foar har jaan.
This was not good.	Dit wie net goed.
He can talk, but he does not speak.	Hy kin prate, mar hy praat net.
And now he's here again.	En no is er hjir wer.
If only he could be back in class.	As er mar wer yn 'e klasse koe.
That's what I've always said.	Dat haw ik altyd sein.
We should have done the same.	Wy hiene itselde dwaan moatten.
It became the talk of the town.	It waard it praat fan 'e stêd.
When the man saw was not sure.	As de man seach wie net wis.
She did not look like a child anymore.	Se seach gjin bern mear út.
I never did that.	Dat haw ik noait dien.
I would say, an animal.	Ik soe sizze, in bist.
You would have done the same.	Jo soene hawwe dien itselde.
Is it okay if you.	Is it goed as jo.
I can speak it.	Ik kin it prate.
It was just what he needed.	It wie krekt wat hy nedich hie.
You're the only one who can say.	Do bist de iennichste dy't sizze kin.
I have never seen her so hurt and angry.	Ik haw har noch noait sa sear en lilk sjoen.
We just do not think about it.	Wy tinke der gewoan net oan.
Or what you all think would be best.	Of wat jo allegear tinke soe it bêste wêze.
We take your word.	Wy nimme jo wurd.
Look at that girl there!	Sjoch nei dat famke dêr!
That's a lot of work.	Dat is in protte wurk.
I have lived here for over three years.	Ik haw hjir mear as trije jier wenne.
I want to do the right thing.	Ik wol it goede dwaan.
Could not make any of this.	Koe hjir neat fan meitsje.
Maybe a month or two.	Miskien in moanne as twa.
And they just come through.	En se komme gewoan troch.
He did a pretty good job.	Hy die in aardich goed wurk.
If she ever saw one again.	As se oait wer ien seach.
It was mine now.	It wie no myn.
And they have nothing to do with him.	En se ha neat oan him.
Everyone liked to be around him.	Elkenien mocht graach om him hinne.
He saw people coming and going.	Hy seach minsken kommen en gean.
Of course, it was too late.	Fansels, it wie te let.
It works, it all works.	It wurket, it wurket allegear.
I almost gave up.	Ik joech my hast op.
Maybe you can make a man out of him.	Miskien kinne jo in man fan him meitsje.
These are children.	Dit binne bern.
You never take anything out.	Jo nimme noait wat út.
She wanted nothing more to do with it.	Se woe der neat mear oer ha.
I can not agree.	Ik kin net iens.
We know what to see.	Wy witte wat te sjen.
It did not work and we will not go back.	It wurke net en wy geane net werom.
I have not and will not.	Ik haw net en sil net.
Well, maybe they do.	No, miskien dogge se.
That was all a long time ago.	Dat alles wie lang lyn.
I think she has a good reason.	Ik tink dat se in goede reden hat.
No one could.	Nimmen koe er.
I see you coming and going.	Ik sjoch dy komme en gean.
I did not tell my children too much.	Ik haw myn bern net te folle ferteld.
She knows exactly why.	Se wit krekt wêrom.
She saw everything at once.	Se seach alles yn ien kear.
You do not have to talk about me.	Jo hoege net oer my te praten.
She never heard from him again.	Se hearde noait wer fan him.
He never hit me.	Hy hat my nea rekke.
And the time was upon her.	En de tiid wie op har.
Mom had said it herself.	Mem hie it sels sein.
I really like everything.	Ik hâld echt fan alles.
And now, now she knew more.	En no, no wist se mear.
It's not much, but we do not do this for the money.	It is net folle, mar wy dogge dit net foar it jild.
It all.	It allegear.
She looked at me.	Se seach my oan.
Well, here it is.	No, hjir is it.
Please believe it, believe it, please.	Leau it asjebleaft, leau it, asjebleaft.
It took them an hour.	It kocht se in oere.
They will all be here.	Se sille hjir allegear wêze.
I'm just a guy with a job to do.	Ik bin gewoan in man mei in baan te dwaan.
But it does not let you.	Mar it lit dy net.
He opened the door.	Hy die de doar iepen.
I did, of course.	Ik die fansels.
We have what we need.	Wy hawwe wat wy nedich hawwe.
That's not the right way.	Dat is net de goede manier.
There had been something.	Der hie wat west.
It's just not too late.	It is gewoan net te let.
There is no saying what you can find next !.	D'r is gjin sizzen wat jo folgjende kinne fine!.
It still works.	It wurket noch.
She looked back at him.	Se seach nei him werom.
That's not really what it's about.	Dêr giet it eins net om.
No one could help you.	Nimmen koe dy helpe.
She had scared everyone for her.	Se hie elkenien bang foar har makke.
It did not seem like he was really asking us.	It like net dat er ús echt frege.
Getting too old, he says.	Te âld wurde, seit er.
Always look for the good.	Sjoch altyd op it goede.
You should not either.	Jo moatte ek net.
Do I like it? 	Liket it my?
he says.	hy seit.
My friend is here now.	Myn freon is hjir no.
He's still there.	Hy is der noch.
And if they were.	En as se wiene.
We worked hard to get him.	Wy hawwe hurd wurke om him te krijen.
His father has my father.	Syn heit hat myn heit.
That's how long you have.	Dat is hoe lang jo hawwe.
I'm giving that up.	Ik jou dat op.
Keep this water.	Hâld dit wetter.
You will not be in the water.	Jo sille net yn it wetter wêze.
She thinks wrong.	Se tinkt ferkeard.
We have no children.	Wy hawwe gjin bern.
I wanted to do it.	Ik woe it dwaan.
Next time we're in town.	Folgjende kear binne wy ​​yn 'e stêd.
Hope it's true.	Hoopje dat it wier is.
I do not want to do anything about it.	Ik wol der neat oan dwaan.
You would think.	Jo soene tinke.
Just keep going.	Gean mar troch.
Easy, but wrong.	Maklik, mar ferkeard.
She did not know what to say or not to say.	Se wist net wat se sizze soe of net sizze.
We're just coming.	Wy komme gewoan.
Nothing ever happens.	Der bart noait neat.
She was not through with me yet.	Se wie noch net troch mei my.
More than you think.	Mear as jo tinke.
Through and through it goes.	Troch en troch giet it.
This always seems to come back true.	Dit liket altyd wier werom te kommen.
But please.	Mar asjebleaft.
That had really been the case.	Dat hie echt west.
Be careful with what you want.	Wês foarsichtich mei wat jo wolle.
Anyone can still say what he wants.	Elkenien kin noch sizze wat er wol.
It was not what he did much.	It wie net wat er in protte die.
He came out of nowhere.	Hy kaam út it neat.
But this is not the case either.	Mar dit is ek net sa.
Which he sure was.	Wat hy wis wie.
These things are necessary.	Dizze dingen binne nedich.
What makes you want to do that.	Wat makket dat jo wolle dwaan.
But that was not the question.	Mar dat wie net de fraach.
And here it came, here it came, here it came.	En hjir kaam it, hjir kaam it, hjir kaam it.
It should not either.	It moat ek net.
They had no idea.	Se hiene gjin idee.
I'll do one or two.	Ik sil ien of twa dwaan.
Make it a good one.	Meitsje it in goede ien.
In fact, she wanted them.	Eins woe se se wol.
They would not have done it.	Se soene dit net dien hawwe.
And he knew that.	En dat wist hy.
Well, come in here.	No, kom hjir yn.
She knew everything.	Se wist alles.
Now they have kept me in an office.	No hawwe se my yn in kantoar hâlden.
This is what we do.	Dit is wat wy dogge.
Well, things are different.	No, dingen binne oars.
And nothing can.	En neat kin.
He's talking about us.	Hy hat it oer ús.
A large.	In grutte.
I was glad I had her there.	Ik wie bliid dat ik har dêr hie.
Of course, this has been tried before.	Fansels is dit earder besocht.
But it's the best we can do.	Mar it is it bêste dat wy kinne dwaan.
But it did not matter.	Mar it joech neat ta.
This is what happened to other people.	Dit is wat der bard is mei oare minsken.
I knew where it was going to go so early in the movie.	Ik wist wêr't it hinne soe sa betiid yn 'e film.
Has the last word in everything.	Hat it lêste wurd yn alles.
Really, it is.	Echt, it is.
He will want for nothing.	Hy sil foar neat wolle.
But there it is.	Mar dêr is it.
I really really am.	Ik echt echt bin.
Where it had to stay.	Wêr't it bliuwe moast.
That happens to a few people every now and then.	Dat bart by in pear minsken sa no en dan.
My mother has had it, and no one can have it again.	Myn mem hat it hân, en nimmen kin it wer hawwe.
He felt good today.	Hy fielde him hjoed goed.
My wife almost died too.	Myn frou stoar ek hast.
He got a job.	Hy krige wurk.
But all in time.	Mar alles yn 'e tiid.
Her father was a good man.	Har heit wie in goed man.
I was just worried about you.	Ik wie gewoan soargen foar dy.
I'm going away for two months.	Ik gean twa moanne fuort.
Talk to me some more.	Praat mar wat mear mei my.
I obviously liked it a lot more.	Ik fûn it fansels folle mear.
She let him go.	Se liet him gean.
You did not give her a chance.	Jo hawwe har gjin kâns jûn.
Life stands in the way, work stands in the way.	It libben stiet yn 'e wei, it wurk stiet yn 'e wei.
He was clearly worried.	Hy wie dúdlik soargen.
Not much to do, but what.	Net folle te dwaan, mar wat.
They plan to have many more children.	Se binne fan plan om folle mear bern te hawwen.
Her father had never spoken to her like that before.	Har heit hie noch nea sa mei har praat.
And probably next month as well.	En nei alle gedachten ek takom moanne.
It really scares me.	It makket my echt bang.
Or maybe he did not feel well.	Of miskien fielde er him net goed.
Maybe that's it.	Miskien is dat it.
We were not.	Wy wiene net.
There really is no other way.	D'r is echt gjin oare manier.
That's just not good.	Dat is gewoan net goed.
I walked away from home.	Ik bin fan hûs wei rûn.
I wish she was there.	Ik mocht graach dat se dêr wie.
And more than once.	En mear as ien kear.
Take it together now.	Nim it no tegearre.
You could say.	Jo soene sizze kinne.
No question about that.	Gjin fraach oer dat.
He was waiting for me to say something.	Hy wachte op my om wat te sizzen.
The problem is, it sure works.	It probleem is, it wurket wis.
She was sitting in a car.	Se siet yn in auto.
Then another and another.	Dan noch ien en noch ien.
Nobody ever does.	Nimmen docht oait.
We can help you.	Wy kinne jo helpe.
They had never expected it.	Se hiene it noait ferwachte.
We take them.	Wy nimme se.
That's exactly what I knew.	Dat wist ik krekt.
Something happened to him.	Der barde wat mei him.
But life does not have to be that way.	Mar it libben hoecht net sa te wêzen.
No one tried to stop him.	Nimmen besocht him tsjin te hâlden.
I did not want to think anymore.	Ik woe net mear tinke.
It was as if she was talking.	It like as soe se it praten dwaan.
Please help me.	Help my asjebleaft.
It would be.	It soe wêze.
Nobody asked me to return the money.	Nimmen hat my frege om jild werom te jaan.
Good and good, then.	Goed en goed, dan.
I had to talk to him.	Ik moast mei him prate.
He had to wait.	Hy moast wachtsje.
And that was the other thing.	En dat wie it oare ding.
Life would never be the same again.	It libben soe nea wer itselde wêze.
It was here that he first went to school.	It wie hjir dat hy earst nei skoalle gie.
He would be himself again.	Hy soe wer himsels wêze.
I have a plan, and it might just work.	Ik haw in plan, en it kin gewoan wurkje.
He looked the same.	Hy like itselde.
You have a place for everything and like everything in its place.	Jo hawwe in plak foar alles en like alles op syn plak.
I think she just wanted him around.	Ik tink dat se krekt woe him hinne.
It goes with the work.	It giet mei it wurk.
He tried to tell his friend something.	Hy besocht syn freon wat te fertellen.
Are you angry?	Bist lilk?
I'm pretty tired.	Ik bin aardich wurch.
And he is not the only one.	En hy is net de ienige.
He never seems to keep a girl long.	Hy liket noait in famke lang te hâlden.
The other children have nothing to do with it either.	De oare bern ha der ek neat mear oan.
All have major problems.	Allegear hawwe grutte problemen.
I wish everything well.	Ik winskje alles goed.
I have things to do.	Ik haw dingen te dwaan.
But he saw nothing.	Mar hy seach neat.
She was not so sure of him.	Se wie net sa wis fan him.
I've told you how she is.	Ik haw jo ferteld hoe't se is.
She should not be found.	Se moat net fûn wurde.
Me and whatever her name was.	Ik en wat har namme ek wie.
They had time.	Se hiene tiid.
I want to tell her what's going to happen.	Ik wol har fertelle wat der barre sil.
She has not been well.	Se hat it net goed west.
Now about the other.	No oer de oare.
This is where things go from good to not so good.	Hjir is wêr't dingen gean fan goed nei net sa goed.
They do not know what work is.	Se witte net wat wurk is.
Now you can get back to work.	No kinne jo wer oan it wurk.
Believe me, you do not want to know.	Leau my, jo wolle it net witte.
More work to do.	Mear wurk te dwaan.
See you.	Sjoch dy.
You do not know as much as you think.	Jo witte net safolle as jo tinke.
They don’t let it go either.	Se litte it ek net litte.
So everyone is different.	Sa is elkenien oars.
She's yours now.	Se is no fan dy.
Nothing was said, nothing happened.	Der waard neat sein, der barde neat.
And there is nothing to eat.	En der is neat te iten.
He did not want to do anything with it.	Hy woe der neat mei dwaan.
Of course there is.	Fansels is der.
But she did it.	Mar se die it.
I was really happy with it.	Ik wie der echt bliid mei.
I have to, of course.	Ik moat fansels.
Very well, you can come if you want.	Hiel goed, jo kinne komme as jo wolle.
They talk together.	Se prate tegearre.
Far too early for this, but it had to be done.	Folle te betiid foar dit, mar it moast dien wurde.
And it's all for me.	En it is allegear foar my.
Clearly he did not want to get in there.	Dúdlik woe er der net yn.
And it actually does it well.	En it docht it eins goed.
The more you work, the more you eat.	Hoe mear jo wurkje, hoe mear jo ite.
I'm so happy about that.	Dêr bin ik sa bliid fan.
They come in here.	Se komme hjir yn.
I would love to be with a friend.	Ik soe graach by in freon wêze.
If it were not, it would be.	As it net wie, sil it wêze.
Or someone can.	Of immen kin.
Maybe it was not.	Miskien wie it net.
Could say nothing.	Koe neat sizze.
And that's what happened.	En dat is wat bard.
But that's not it.	Mar dat is it net.
Now he could only wait.	No koe er mar wachtsje.
A name is a name.	In namme is in namme.
But this may well wait.	Mar dit kin wol wachtsje.
It's there.	It is dêr.
I would never do anything else.	Ik soe noait wat oars dwaan.
There is something else.	Der is wat oars.
I was completely wrong.	Ik wie hielendal ferkeard.
Well, maybe so.	No, miskien wol.
But he knew a little about it, even though it was difficult.	Mar hy koe in bytsje oer, al wie it dreech.
Of course, given where they were.	Fansels, jûn wêr't se wiene.
I would tell her everything.	Ik soe har alles fertelle.
He's the one who told me to do this.	Hy is dejinge dy't my fertelde dit te dwaan.
I just ask them what they do before they go to bed.	Ik freegje har gewoan wat se dogge foardat se op bêd gean.
However, she probably has one.	Hoe dan ek, se hat wierskynlik ien.
But first you have to get there.	Mar earst moatte jo der komme.
All it is is your next book.	Alles wat it is is jo folgjende boek.
If anyone could help him, she could.	As immen him helpe koe, dan koe se dat wol.
I think she can come back tonight.	Ik tink dat se fannacht werom kin.
And did his life.	En die syn libben.
We do the same thing.	Wy dogge itselde ding.
I was surprised and happy.	Ik wie ferrast en bliid.
Do you want to keep this for me?	Wolle jo dit foar my hâlde?
Do them if you want.	Doch se as jo wolle.
I know you through and through.	Ik ken dy troch en troch.
I have not decided.	Ik haw net besletten.
I think it would be better than no one.	Ik tink dat it better wêze soe as nimmen.
She should not be around me.	Se soe net om my hinne moatte.
I have that.	Ik haw dat.
Everything went well at first.	Alles gie earst goed.
That is what you would hope for.	Dat soene jo hoopje.
Not one of us said anything.	Net ien fan ús sei wat.
But we must try.	Mar wy moatte besykje.
This has been the time of my life.	Dit hat de tiid fan myn libben west.
Not just us.	Net allinnich wy.
I let it go to see what would happen then.	Ik liet it gean om te sjen wat der dan barre soe.
, '.	, '.
You have one chance.	Jo hawwe ien kâns.
He was ready for that.	Dêr wie er klear foar.
You are not doing everything you can.	Jo dogge net alles wat jo kinne dwaan.
There was a dog.	Der wie in hûn.
It's for the best, he said to himself.	It is foar it bêste, sei er tsjin himsels.
But he never seemed to have enough.	Mar hy like noait genôch te hawwen.
I have no children.	Ik ha gjin bern.
One by one.	Ien foar ien.
You do not have to do anything!	Jo hoege neat te dwaan!
There is nothing else for me.	Der is neat oars foar my.
Neither do you.	Jo ek net.
Not much was said.	Der waard net folle sein.
It just has to.	It moat gewoan.
But not away this time.	Mar net fuort dizze kear.
They come to you and they know who you are.	Se komme nei jo ta en se witte wa't jo binne.
They go out to eat.	Se geane út te iten.
I was not home.	Ik wie net thús.
Don't get me wrong, here.	Nim my net ferkeard, hjir.
I should know these things.	Ik soe dizze dingen witte moatte.
Quite simply, they are the best of their kind.	Hiel gewoan, se binne de bêste fan har soarte.
She tried to talk to him, but he ran away.	Se besocht mei him te praten, mar hy rûn fuort.
You look a bit like her.	Jo lykje in bytsje op har.
Did he do it right? 	Hat er it goede dien?
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
Can't say what she thinks.	Kin net sizze wat se tinkt.
Finding a way home.	It finen fan in wei nei hûs.
Same thing, really.	Itselde ding, echt.
Hours, he thought.	Oeren, tocht er.
You just have to pay more.	Jo moatte gewoan mear betelje.
I have one here.	Ik haw hjir ien.
You can have them if you want them.	Jo kinne se hawwe as jo se wolle.
He did not look at her.	Hy seach har net oan.
You know that, but you do not know well.	Jo witte dat, mar jo witte net fan goed.
I told you not to worry.	Ik sei dy net soargen.
Take as many as you want.	Nim safolle as jo wolle.
But let's get to that.	Mar litte wy der oan komme.
Pass this on.	Jou dizze troch.
It occurred to me when our friend was here.	It kaam by my doe't ús freon hjir wie.
Well, just talk to me if anything happens.	No, praat mar mei my as der wat bart.
I know the city well.	Ik ken de stêd goed.
Do not make this difficult.	Meitsje dit net dreech.
It's hard to see.	It is dreech om te sjen.
I saw him yesterday.	Ik seach him juster.
I do not want you here.	Ik wol dy hjir net.
He took questions.	Hy naam fragen.
He thought they were open.	Hy tocht dat se iepen wiene.
Not for the time being.	Net foar de tiid rûn.
I will make food.	Ik sil iten meitsje.
A woman too.	In frou ek.
She could do this, she had to do this.	Se koe dit dwaan, se moast dit dwaan.
There is nothing better.	Der is neat better.
Nobody likes to grow old.	Nimmen hâldt fan âld wurde.
He just wanted to see you one last time.	Hy woe dy gewoan in lêste kear sjen.
They are friends now.	Se binne no freonen.
He walked through the other door.	Hy rûn troch de oare doar.
And we have almost no time.	En wy hawwe hast gjin tiid.
I found the problem.	Ik fûn it probleem.
There was no way to do it.	Der wie gjin manier om it te dwaan.
He knew his father more than before.	Hy koe syn heit mear as earder.
This happened this year.	Dit barde dit jier.
You have to tell yourself if you have no help.	Jo moatte sels fertelle as jo gjin help hawwe.
It would not help, he thought.	It soe net helpe, tocht er.
It is not enough to say.	It is net genôch om te sizzen.
Take what you need from me.	Nim wat jo nedich hawwe fan my.
So it has been so far.	Sa wie it oant no ta.
The police were harsh with the child.	De plysje wie hurd mei it bern.
She has been ill for a very long time.	Se is al hiel lang siik.
You may find it difficult to get another job.	Jo kinne it dreech fine om in oare baan te krijen.
Probably even more so.	Wierskynlik noch mear.
This should be expected.	Dit moat ferwachte wurde.
I did not expect it to be so.	Ik hie net ferwachte dat it sa soe wêze.
All the best!.	It bêste!.
I thought he was angry at me.	Ik tocht dat er lilk op my wie.
Let me keep you.	Lit my jo hâlde.
He knew this was different for his wife.	Hy wist dat dit oars wie foar syn frou.
He started a new job this year.	Hy begûn dit jier in nije baan.
I read something about him this week.	Ik haw dizze wike wat oer him lêzen.
I did not let go.	Ik liet my net litte.
I can not stay home today.	Ik kin hjoed net thús bliuwe.
I want two more.	Ik wol noch twa.
I had a lot to say.	Ik hie in protte te sizzen.
I just thought of you yesterday.	Ik tocht juster krekt oan dy.
We can better go home.	Wy kinne better nei hûs ta.
It's true and you know it.	It is wier en jo witte it.
But they knew where it was.	Mar se wisten wêr't it wie.
I do not know exactly how many we will see.	Ik wit net krekt hoefolle wy sille sjen.
In fact, he had two.	Eins hie er twa.
They will not hurt.	Se sille net sear komme.
She did not want to say these things to her children.	Se woe dizze dingen net tsjin har bern sizze hoege.
We do exactly the same things they do.	Wy dogge krekt deselde dingen dy't se dogge.
She worked hard all day.	Se wurke de hiele dei hurd.
Here, let me show you.	Hjir, lit my dy sjen litte.
The animal arrived.	It bist kaam oan.
I can not be angry at myself.	Ik kin net lilk op my wêze.
One day of nothing but the truth.	Ien dei fan neat oars as de wierheid.
This can happen quite easily.	Dit kin frij maklik barre.
Or maybe he was not.	Of miskien wie er net.
But this is not the case now.	Mar dit is no net sa.
But then you are the next.	Mar dan binne jo de folgjende.
Nobody knew exactly what was going to happen.	Nimmen wist krekt wat der barre soe.
Finally, let’s see.	As lêste litte wy sjen.
Maybe he can.	Miskien kin er.
Everyone had heard his.	Elkenien hie syn heard.
Let's stay together.	Litte wy tegearre bliuwe.
Next week it will be different.	Takom wike sil it oars wêze.
If you do not, it will probably not work for you.	As jo ​​​​dat net dogge, wurket it wierskynlik net foar jo.
He knows you.	Hy ken dy.
My mother was hurt.	Myn mem rekke sear.
Tomorrow tomorrow will be another morning.	Moarn moarn wer in oare moarn wêze.
She tells us.	Se fertelle ús.
It was true and it was not true.	It wie wier en it wie net wier.
Life is for real.	It libben is foar echt.
I'm a man from another time.	Ik bin in man út in oare tiid.
I was real.	Ik wie echt.
No one will hurt you.	Nimmen sil dy sear dwaan.
I know it's him.	Ik wit dat it him is.
Let's get to work.	Litte wy oan it wurk.
It's hard for me and different not to be out there.	It is foar my dreech en oars om der net út te wêzen.
It was the first time he had seen her.	It wie de earste kear dat er har seach.
But there it was.	Mar dêr wie it.
So he will be ready to go.	Sa sil hy ree wêze om te gean.
We need to think about our children.	Wy moatte tinke oan ús bern.
But he did not give in.	Mar hy joech net yn.
That will not help me, much.	Dat sil my net helpe, folle.
I want to.	Ik wol.
The idea was accurate.	It idee wie krekt.
I am sick.	Ik bin siik.
It came first for the other, it should not have.	It kaam earst foar de oare, it hie net moatten.
Tell us what the problems are and why.	Fertel ús wat de problemen binne en wêrom.
And it was fun.	En it wie leuk.
Then try to figure it out or just tell him the word.	Besykje it dan út te finen of fertel him gewoan it wurd.
I truly believe that now.	Dat leau ik no wier.
That's all true.	Dat is allegear wier.
I needed her to help me help her.	Ik hie se nedich om my te helpen har te helpen.
More than likely, this woman could not work.	Mear dan wierskynlik koe dizze frou net wurkje.
There would never be another one after today.	D'r soe nei hjoed noait wer mear wêze.
He has been very good.	Hy hat tige goed west.
They were good, but not so good.	Se wiene goed, mar net sa goed.
There she wanted to be.	Dêr woe se wêze.
And he did not expect that.	En dat hie er net ferwachte.
He just made it.	Hy hat it krekt makke.
You should not have been so scared.	Do hiest net sa bang wêze moatten.
Thoughts with his family.	Gedachten mei syn famylje.
Hope you do the same.	Hoopje dat jo itselde dogge.
I'm sure he does not.	Ik bin der wis fan dat hy dat net docht.
I've been there before.	Ik haw der earder west.
I'm not really here.	Ik bin hjir net echt.
I do not ask about her mother.	Ik freegje net oer har mem.
That will tell you a lot.	Dat sil jo in protte fertelle.
I want the same for my kids.	Ik wol itselde foar myn bern.
She knows better than anyone what happened.	Se wit better as elkenien wat der bard is.
And there is more on the way today.	En der is mear op 'e wei hjoed.
It happens often.	It bart faak.
I think so .	Ik tink it .
I just wanted to get away.	Ik woe gewoan fuort.
Her friends believe it.	Har freonen leauwe it.
Is a lot.	Is in protte.
He comes from a large family.	Hy komt út in grutte famylje.
Help for today.	Help foar hjoed.
He's a day early.	Hy is in dei betiid.
That's our problem.	Dat is ús probleem.
This was the first time we met.	Dit wie de earste kear dat wy moete.
I do not want it to be.	Ik wol it net wêze moatte.
You are so good to us.	Do bist sa goed foar ús.
But not here, and not now.	Mar net hjir, en net no.
You can find him from there.	Dêr kinne jo him fan fine.
There is nothing more in my life.	Der is neat mear yn myn libben.
The mother is not well.	De mem is net goed.
And you're fine.	En do bist goed.
There were other things.	Der wiene oare dingen.
I was not sure it would work.	Ik wie der net wis fan dat it soe wurkje.
We need to tell the truth.	Wy moatte de wierheid prate.
That was something.	Dat wie wat.
That, of course, is good.	Dat is fansels goed.
They were together last night.	Se wiene fannacht tegearre.
That they could find.	Dat koene se fine.
You have to have faith.	Jo moatte leauwe hawwe.
He did exactly what he had to do.	Hy die krekt wat er dwaan moast.
They keep me in place.	Se hâlde my op it plak.
Would not mind looking at them.	Soe it net tinke om nei har te sjen.
Up and over.	Op en oer.
It works well.	It wurket goed.
The good kind, of course.	De goede soarte, fansels.
That kind of thing is just wrong.	Dat soarte ding is gewoan ferkeard.
Easy to say.	Maklik te sizzen.
I did this using this question.	Ik die dit mei help fan dizze fraach.
He had no idea what to say to her.	Hy hie gjin idee wat er tsjin har sizze moast.
I thought he would do that.	Ik tocht dat er dat dwaan soe.
And took a picture.	En makke in foto.
We just want to do the right thing.	Wy wolle gewoan it goede dwaan.
I'm not interested in that kind of question.	Ik bin net ynteressearre yn dat soarte fan fraach.
All we can do is wait and see.	Alles wat wy kinne dwaan is wachtsje en sjen.
Everything you make is yours to keep forever.	Alles wat jo meitsje is fan jo om foar altyd te hâlden.
A nice place to go for dinner with friends.	In moai plak om te gean foar it iten mei freonen.
You have to do those things.	Jo moatte dy dingen dwaan.
Now he was in me.	No wie er yn my.
I'm glad we did.	Ik bin bliid dat wy it dogge.
What could it be otherwise.	Wat koe it oars.
Wish him well in all your thoughts about him.	Winskje him goed yn jo alle gedachten oer him.
I would like to talk about your new work.	Ik wol graach prate oer jo nije wurk.
For the time being.	Foar no.
But you do not need my help.	Mar jo hawwe myn help net nedich.
The best of.	It bêste fan.
There had to be nothing else.	Der hoegde neat oars te wêzen.
Your children are no different.	Jo bern binne net oars.
He could not help it.	Hy soe it net helpe kinne.
This can never be good.	Dit kin nea goed wêze.
We have met before.	Wy hawwe moete foar.
This is your being and being sure.	Dit is jo wêzen en wis wêze.
We'll probably be late for work this evening.	Wy sille dizze jûn wierskynlik let oan it wurk.
There she had to stop.	Dêr moast se ophâlde.
Now she was just trying to be nice.	No besocht se gewoan aardich te wêzen.
Well, maybe not at all.	No, miskien net hielendal.
We do not want it to happen again.	Wy wolle it net wer barre.
Maybe he was 'different' with her.	Miskien wie er 'oars' mei har.
The woman seemed happy.	De frou like bliid.
For enough talk.	Foar genôch praten.
She should not have had one herself.	Se hie der sels gjin ha moatten.
He wished you were still his girl.	Hy woe dat jo noch syn famke wiene.
She just never had one when he met.	Se hie gewoan noait ien as hy moete.
We do not know what we can find there.	Wy witte net wat wy dêr fine kinne.
And that she needed my help.	En dat se myn help nedich hie.
This is a question.	Dit is in fraach.
For about two months he worked every day.	Sa'n twa moanne lang wurke er alle dagen.
It's not just us either.	It binne ek net allinnich wy.
Nothing he had better.	Neat hie er better.
It was not in the right place.	It wie net op it goede plak.
She was in there.	Se wie der yn.
It does not hurt.	It docht gjin sear.
I almost feel like they know this.	Ik fiel hast dat se dit witte.
Come back soon.	Kom gau werom.
Everything came back well.	Alles kaam goed werom.
We are different here.	Wy binne hjir oars.
How long are we staying here?	Hoe lang bliuwe wy hjir?
I obviously should never have done it.	Ik hie it fansels noait dwaan moatten.
Maybe you will be.	Miskien sille jo wêze.
We will not need it in the following.	Wy sille it net nedich wêze yn it folgjende.
He knew that now.	Dat wist er no.
You in the following.	Jo yn 'e folgjende.
I did not say that.	Dat sei ik net.
That's what we want to see.	Dat wolle wy sjen.
We used to get a lot of things that way.	Wy krigen eartiids in protte dingen op dy manier.
We should do something about that.	Dêr soene wy ​​wat oan dwaan moatte.
Does anyone have any questions?	Hat immen fragen?
Are the big problem now.	Binne it grutte probleem no.
Come back in and sit down.	Kom werom yn en sit.
Be it so then.	Wês it dan sa.
The parents have worked hard for the children.	De âlden hawwe hurd wurke foar de bern.
How many children do you have?	Hoefolle bern hawwe jo?
Just let me know when.	Lit my gewoan witte wannear.
Without it, it can not win.	Sûnder dat kin it net winne.
She's sure of it.	Se is der wis fan.
The same cannot be said here.	Itselde kin hjir net sein wurde.
It will not be the last time.	It sil net de lêste kear wêze.
However, he needs your help.	Hoe dan ek, hy hat jo help nedich.
Tell us what you like or dislike.	Fertel ús wat jo leuk fine of wat jo net leuk fine.
Now it's on.	No is it oan.
That life I just did not want.	Dat libben woe ik gewoan net.
We take what's there.	Wy nimme wat der is.
I know this city very well.	Ik ken dizze stêd hiel goed.
When she woke up, she was in his office.	Doe't se wekker waard, wie se yn syn kantoar.
The money was there.	It jild wie der.
It is not anything other than what you are.	It is net wat oars as wat jo binne.
When we started.	Doe't wy begûn.
And ask her.	En freegje har.
A belief is more than an idea.	In leauwe is mear as in idee.
I can not think of anyone else.	Ik kin net oan immen oars tinke.
Many people were really scared of him.	In protte minsken wiene echt bang foar him.
This is my favorite photo.	Dit is myn favorite foto.
He's a bad boy.	Hy is in minne jonge.
And keep you ready.	En hâldt jo klear.
She wants her friend with her.	Se wol har freon mei har.
This is not good enough.	Dit is net goed genôch.
You have to wait.	Jo moatte wachtsje.
You will always love him or her.	Jo sille altyd fan him of har hâlde.
I'm totally into it.	Ik bin der hielendal yn.
The photo showed him as a young man.	De foto liet him sjen as in jonge man.
My mother liked to be a mother.	Myn mem mocht graach mem wêze.
Show what can be.	Lit sjen wat kin wêze.
They will just see what is good.	Se sille gewoan sjen wat goed is.
My kids needed the best of me.	Myn bern hiene it bêste fan my nedich.
She could not tell him what to do.	Se koe him net sizze wat er dwaan moast.
Life is now.	It libben is no.
She had never done that before.	Dat hie se noch nea dien.
Of course we knew him.	Fansels koene wy ​​him.
That's what you did.	Dat hawwe jo dien.
I still think we have that.	Ik tink noch dat wy dat hawwe.
Of course he is interested.	Fansels is hy ynteressearre.
You know best.	Jo witte it bêste.
She does not seem to have any friends.	Se liket gjin freonen te hawwen.
But something must have happened.	Mar der moat wat bard wêze.
I know everyone's busy.	Ik wit dat elkenien it drok hat.
I think that's true.	Ik tink dat dat wier is.
The woman did what she was told.	De frou die wat har sein waard.
This, here, was wrong.	Dit, hjir, wie ferkeard.
Go easy.	Gean mar maklik.
She was not happy.	Se wie net bliid.
I had no idea why, but that did not matter.	Ik hie gjin idee wêrom, mar dat hoegde net.
More than other people.	Mear as oare minsken.
Be good everyone.	Wês goed allegear.
I was sick.	Ik wie siik.
There we are these days.	Dêr binne wy ​​dizze dagen.
I would hope it would make him better.	Ik soe hoopje dat it him better meitsje soe.
But of course not.	Mar fansels net.
He never knew what it made, exactly.	Hy wist noait wat it makke, krekt.
Where you want to be.	Wêr't jo wêze wolle.
The problem is that they are not.	It probleem is dat se net binne.
I want them to know that.	Ik wol dat se dat witte.
If he does, he can win.	As er dat docht, kin er winne.
I gave him mine.	Ik joech him myn.
We expected the work to be easy.	Wy ferwachte dat it wurk maklik soe wêze.
We can not agree that this is true.	Wy kinne it net iens wêze dat dit wier is.
In truth, she actually did not know too much.	Yn wierheid wist se eins net te folle.
Long, long away.	Lang, lang fuort.
Many and one.	In protte en ien.
That was fine, but it was not enough yet.	Dat wie goed, mar it wie noch net genôch.
You do not have to worry about it.	Jo hoege jo gjin soargen te meitsjen.
I'm sure it will.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it sil.
Nobody does, really.	Nimmen docht, echt.
It's very good.	It is hiel goed.
The child looked at her father.	It bern seach har heit oan.
And you can never know the truth.	En jo kinne noait de wierheid witte.
Well, here you go.	No, hjir geane jo.
That's entirely up to you.	Dat is hielendal oan dy.
I think she's getting too old for work.	Ik tink dat se te âld wurdt foar it wurk.
She told me to read it.	Se fertelde my om it te lêzen.
We really can do no more than that.	Wy kinne echt net mear dwaan as dat.
I do not know for sure, and you do not know for sure.	Ik wit it net wis, en jo witte it wis net.
We then have the following.	Wy hawwe dan it folgjende.
I asked if he had done this.	Ik frege oft hy dit dien hie.
A little is enough.	In bytsje is genôch.
I asked if she needed help.	Ik frege oft se help nedich hie.
Like, really love it.	Like, hâld der echt fan.
But we're glad you're our friends.	Mar wy binne bliid dat jo ús freonen binne.
You need to talk to me about it.	Jo moatte der mei my oer prate.
Do that.	Dat dwaan.
That kind of work is not easy.	Dat soarte fan wurk is net maklik.
Maybe my plan worked after all.	Miskien wurke myn plan nei alle gedachten.
She quickly looked away.	Se seach gau fuort.
There is nothing more to say now.	Der is no neat mear te sizzen.
And take a new path home.	En in nije wei nei hûs nimme.
I will not take it anymore.	Ik sil it net mear nimme.
It would work well.	It soe goed wurkje.
I am always with her children.	Ik bin altyd by har bern.
It was good that he did not have to find.	It wie goed dat er net hoegde te finen.
I love both.	Ik hâld fan beide.
Do not hold anymore.	Net mear hâlde.
Then this, then that.	Dan dit, dan dat.
Or they can just see what you know.	Of se kinne gewoan sjen wat jo witte.
He was not even sure if he could say anything.	Hy wie der net iens wis fan oft er wat sizze koe.
There was only one reason for that.	Dêr wie mar ien reden foar.
This can not happen.	Dit kin net barre.
That's just not.	Dat die se net.
We know this too.	Dit witte wy ek.
Just about too long.	Krekt oer te lang.
Glad you're with us.	Bliid dat jo by ús binne.
This is how it works.	Sa wurket it.
It's too long ago.	It is te lang lyn.
I was walking alone now.	Ik rûn no allinnich.
She loves school and she can go.	Se hâldt fan skoalle en se kin gean.
But we must try.	Mar wy moatte besykje.
Good to see you.	Goed om dy te sjen.
Not a whole lot, but a few.	Net in hiele protte, mar in pear.
He removed his hand.	Hy die syn hân fuort.
But I'm not against the other guy.	Mar ik bin net tsjin de oare keardel.
It can be so.	It kin sa wêze.
It's his way out.	It is syn wei út.
I can do something for you.	Ik kin wat foar dy dwaan.
There seemed to be no way out.	Der like gjin wei út.
They are good at that.	Dêr binne se goed yn.
You really do not.	Jo echt net.
That just will not happen.	Dat sil gewoan net barre.
She has no idea which of these they might need.	Se hat gjin idee hokker fan dizze se miskien nedich hawwe.
Doing better would not be easy.	Better dwaan soe net maklik wêze.
I just thought of you.	Ik tocht krekt oan dy.
One of us there should be enough.	Ien fan ús dêr moat genôch wêze.
They did more than that.	Se diene mear as dat.
I know this is true.	Ik wit dat dit wier is.
I even met something.	Ik haw sels wat moete.
He became a friend just as well.	Hy waard like goed in freon.
I want something long, but not too long.	Ik wol wat lang, mar net te lang.
I know it's not easy, but you can do it right.	Ik wit dat it net maklik is, mar jo kinne it goed meitsje.
It was real, though it could not be real.	It wie echt, al koe it net echt wêze.
What, she did not know.	Wat, wist se net.
Both make things look beautiful.	Beide meitsje dingen moai moai.
Does not look good.	Sjocht der net goed út.
Looked at me for a long time.	Seach my lang oan.
But take her mar.	Mar nim har mar.
I was the same.	Ik wie itselde.
And this is where we are.	En dit is wêr't wy binne.
I'll help you this morning.	Ik sil dy moarn helpe.
What he is is still pretty good.	Wat hy is is noch aardich goed.
They are very happy.	Se binne tige bliid.
But this is not good either.	Mar dit is ek net goed.
This would be her year.	Dit soe har jier wêze.
And he's my friend.	En hy is myn freon.
We think about that.	Dêr tinke wy oan.
He did not know who she was or where he could find her again.	Hy wist net wa't se wie of wêr't er har wer fine koe.
Anything else? 	Oars noch wat?
asked the woman.	frege de frou.
She knows me too well.	Se ken my te goed.
The children were happy to help.	De bern wiene graach helpe.
Really, they are.	Echt, se binne.
I can 't do any good here.	Ik kin hjir gjin goed dwaan.
She was not a friend.	Se wie gjin freon.
He had no idea where this road came from.	Hy hie gjin idee wêr't dizze wei kaam.
She looked very, very happy.	Se seach der hiel, hiel bliid út.
It's pretty easy.	It is frij maklik.
You can make friends.	Jo kinne freonen meitsje.
So she went first.	Sa gie se earst.
There was nothing left.	Der bleau neat oer.
I have to get very sick.	Ik moat hiel siik wurde.
You're getting out of here.	Jo komme hjir wei.
For that alone, they are a big concern.	Foar dat allinnich, se binne in grutte soargen.
But whatever happens, you want to talk.	Mar wat bart, jo wolle prate.
Wait a minute too.	Wachtsje jo ek mar in bytsje.
Will remain open.	Sil iepen bliuwe.
I do not want to be late.	Ik wol net te let komme.
Or could it have been something else?	Of koe it wat oars west hawwe?
There are two major issues in your question.	D'r binne twa grutte problemen yn jo fraach.
Come on, you know how to do it.	Kom op, jo witte hoe't jo it moatte dwaan.
You were just.	Jo wiene gewoan.
I ran out of everything.	Ik rûn út alles.
And then they do not either.	En dan dogge se ek net.
No one had asked me that before.	Nimmen hie my dat earder frege.
It's hard to see.	It is dreech om te sjen.
We must not let this happen!	Wy moatte dit net barre!
They need to know it.	Se moatte it witte.
He's just a friend.	Hy is gewoan in freon.
I looked around at the other children.	Ik seach om nei de oare bern.
You'll make me so angry.	Jo sille my sa lilk meitsje.
Never in our lives.	Nea yn ús libben.
I still felt like a child.	Ik fielde my sels noch as in bern.
What is wrong is wrong and it is not right.	Wat is ferkeard is ferkeard en it is net goed.
It became clear that the plan would not work.	It waard dúdlik dat it plan net soe wurkje.
We put him away.	Wy sette him fuort.
This is very common.	Dit is hiel gewoan.
They become friends.	Se wurde freonen.
That made me angry.	Dat makke my lilk.
It can not be you.	It kin jo net wêze.
It will take us both.	It sil ús beide nimme.
It seems to have made a new man of me.	It liket in nije man fan my makke te hawwen.
Let your husband make time for himself without you.	Lit dyn man tiid foar himsels sûnder dy.
I would take that class.	Ik soe dy klasse nimme.
He's here now.	Hy is hjir no.
Just told me.	Krekt fertelde my.
I have found a way.	Ik haw in manier fûn.
She just did not tell me.	Se fertelde my gewoan net.
He's doing it right.	Hy docht it goed.
Not many get this chance.	Net folle krije dizze kâns.
Look good.	Sjoch goed.
If so, just let me know.	As dat sa is, moatte jo my mar witte litte.
I see a few issues with this.	Ik sjoch in pear problemen mei dizze.
I could never stop.	Ik koe nea ophâlde.
There's just no way.	Der is gewoan gjin manier.
He could paste it.	Hy koe dit plak.
He was not old.	Hy wie net âld.
There was only one thing for.	Der wie mar ien ding foar.
He will be at the party tonight.	Hy sil fannacht op it feest wêze.
The boy knew full well that he had to go to school.	De jonge wist goed dat er op skoalle moast.
For me, that was never a problem.	Foar my wie dat nea in probleem.
There are none to have.	Der binne gjinien te hawwen.
This time he is.	Dizze kear is hy.
He seemed tired but was not sick.	Hy like wurch, mar wie net siik.
Let's talk first.	Lit ús earst prate.
You need to get out of there.	Jo moatte der út wêze.
Carefully drain the water.	Meitsje it wetter foarsichtich.
They say so themselves.	Dat sizze se sels.
Who and where, how and why, when and what.	Wa en wêr, hoe en wêrom, wannear en wat.
He gave everyone a lot to talk about that weekend.	Hy joech elkenien in protte te praten oer dat wykein.
Tom knew she expected him to say something.	Tom wist dat se ferwachte dat er wat soe sizze.
She had been so sure.	Se hie sa wis west.
I'm not a boy anymore.	Ik bin gjin jonge mear.
The moon goes down.	De moanne giet ûnder.
That we take care of it.	Dat wy der foar soargje.
She did not know what to do so she came to our room.	Se wist net wat se dwaan moast dat se kaam op ús keamer.
It's different than you.	It is oars as dy.
I'll be back tomorrow.	Ik kom moarn werom.
Went to him for two months.	Gie nei him foar twa moanne.
The whole plan.	It hiele plan.
Everyone wants that, but not many get that.	Elkenien wol dat, mar net folle krije dat.
Who is this man?	Wa is dizze man ?
More than good.	Mear dan goed.
This is exactly what he wants to do with it.	Dit is krekt wat er der mei dwaan wol.
They know they have every reason to be afraid.	Se witte dat se alle reden hawwe om bang te wêzen.
I opened the door a little.	Ik die de doar wat iepen.
I'm so glad you came to me.	Ik bin sa bliid dat jo by my binne kommen.
We have enough.	Wy hawwe genôch.
No one knows where she went.	Nimmen wit wêr't se gie.
That's what we do.	Dat dogge wy.
What she was up to.	Wat se wie op.
Someone needs to take care of you.	Immen moat nei dy soargje.
I do not know what will happen.	Ik wit net wat der barre sil.
Look out!	Sjoch út!
We were never in trouble.	Wy wiene nea yn de problemen.
He did not just want to look like that.	Hy woe net gewoan lykje.
I had to go to bed.	Ik moast op bêd.
That should go back to.	Dat moat werom nei.
She's gone too long without.	Se is te lang sûnder gien.
That, of course, comes with a long bed.	Dat komt fansels mei in lang bêd.
Believe me, it actually works.	Leau my, it wurket eins.
Tom will have done that tomorrow.	Tom sil dat moarn dien hawwe.
It's actually very easy.	It is eins hiel maklik.
What we do well.	Wat wy dogge goed.
I really did.	Ik die echt.
This is true.	Dizze is wier.
They will not know what affected them.	Se sille net witte wat har rekke.
What kind of food do you like to eat?	Wat foar iten ite jo graach?
I was a little surprised.	Ik wie in bytsje ferrast.
The child has problems.	It bern hat problemen.
It did not matter.	It makke neat út.
And he said he was not the only one.	En hy sei dat hy net de ienige wie.
Talk to other parents.	Praat mei oare âlden.
If this is true, then hurry up.	As dit wier is, meitsje dan drok.
There was nothing to do but wait.	Der wie neat oars te dwaan as wachtsje.
It was late and they were tired.	It wie let en se wiene wurch.
I know we can.	Ik wit dat wy kinne.
It was really about something.	It gie echt oer wat.
Again he heard nothing.	Wer hearde er neat.
Or maybe it was not.	Of miskien wie it net.
Nobody had to tell me anything.	Nimmen moast my wat fertelle.
She woke up late last night.	Se wie fannacht let wekker.
But he thinks of a girl.	Mar hy tinkt oan in famke.
You can tell me.	Jo kinne my fertelle.
It's so.	It is sa.
I would love to have them on.	Ik mocht har graach oan hawwe.
We know everything.	Wy witte alles.
I give that time.	Ik jou dy tiid.
But he did not have to worry.	Mar hy hoegde gjin soargen te hawwen.
We are.	Wy binne.
It was the first time he had seen her there.	It wie de earste kear dat er har dêr seach.
That way no one would see you.	Op dy manier soe nimmen dy sjen.
He had us clearly in mind when he said it.	Hy hie ús dúdlik yn gedachten doe't er it sei.
Well, it's true.	No, it is wier.
I told her how she could make it and she did.	Ik fertelde har hoe't se it koe meitsje en se die.
he asked.	hy frege.
It should not.	It soe net moatte.
He was not long in town.	Hy wie net lang yn 'e stêd.
There was no time for anything.	Der wie gjin tiid foar neat.
My bed is here.	Myn bêd is hjir.
But they are not, they are against it.	Mar dat binne se net, se binne der op tsjin.
The man just said nothing.	De man sei gewoan neat.
They did not yet know she was here.	Se wisten noch net dat se hjir wie.
Let me know if you have any questions.	Lit my witte as jo fragen hawwe.
This she liked.	Dit mocht se graach.
He needs one bad.	Hy hat ien min nedich.
You know where you want to eat, just tell me.	Jo witte wêr't jo ite wolle, fertel my gewoan.
.	.
He waited two hours in this room.	Hy hat twa oeren yn dizze keamer wachte.
And they do not work.	En se wurkje net.
It still did.	It die it noch.
I have good friends.	Ik haw goede freonen.
But please do not come back.	Mar kom asjebleaft net wer werom.
She was happy with everything she saw.	Se wie bliid mei alles wat se seach.
I love the dog.	Ik hâld fan 'e hûn.
Nice.	Moai.
She had not been sure it would work.	Se hie der net wis fan west dat it soe wurkje.
But he is a very good teacher.	Mar hy is in tige goede learaar.
But maybe that's just me.	Mar miskien bin dat krekt ik.
It was beautiful.	It wie moai.
Even children knew where the big man lived.	Sels bern wisten wêr't de grutte man wenne.
I'll make sure they have your name.	Ik sil der foar soargje dat se jo namme hawwe.
Good to see you, 'he said.	Goed om dy te sjen,' sei er.
Just then and there.	Krekt dan en dêr.
I left her.	Ik liet har.
As if we did not have enough.	As hiene wy ​​net genôch.
We'll have dinner here tonight.	Wy sille hjir fannacht iten ha.
Do not grow old.	Net âld wurde.
It did not seem to him.	It like him net.
And that says a lot.	En dat seit in protte.
She's not your friend.	Se is net dyn freon.
People do this every day.	Minsken dogge dit alle dagen.
It does not matter if you do.	It makket neat út as jo it dogge.
At a time when a few did.	Yn in tiid dat in pear diene.
She would also not tell him that it did not come to him.	Se soe him ek net sizze dat it him net kaam.
But now, things were different.	Mar no, dingen wiene oars.
He did not do it well for himself.	Hy die it net goed foar himsels.
It should have been done a long time ago.	It hie al lang dien moatten.
I love you now, and probably forever.	Ik hâld fan dy no, en wierskynlik foar altyd.
She was good and beautiful.	Se wie goed en moai.
I know it well.	Ik wit it goed.
Of course, this is good enough.	Fansels, dit is goed genôch.
Nobody is watching.	Nimmen sjocht nei.
Why is she doing this?	Wêrom docht se dit?
It was not the same as before.	It wie net itselde as earder.
And now he was hers.	En no wie er fan har.
Go away, you.	Gean mar fuort, do.
That would be the best way to do things.	Dat soe de bêste manier wêze om dingen te dwaan.
She liked to watch.	Se mocht graach sjen.
He has worked hard all his life.	Hy hat syn hiele libben hurd wurke.
She's always too late.	Se is altyd te let.
You found us.	Jo hawwe ús fûn.
If you are a new friend.	As jo ​​​​in nije freon binne.
Same size, over.	Deselde grutte, oer.
Almost no water.	Hast gjin wetter.
I have to say something.	Ik moat wat sizze wolle.
She said she might want to.	Se sei dat se miskien wol.
This is my do.	Dit is myn dwaan.
Everything could be true.	Alles koe wier wêze.
No idea why it does not work now.	Gjin idee wêrom't it no net wurket.
I am sorry.	It spyt my.
Stop this.	Hâld dit op.
From this.	Fan dit.
Look out!	Sjoch út!
I don't think so.	Ik tink it net.
Shit happens.	Dingen barre.
I think that day will be soon.	Ik tink dat dy dei gau wêze sil.
No one else has ever said that about me.	Nimmen oars hat ea sein dat oer my.
Clearly, it should not be there.	It is dúdlik dat it der net wêze moat.
Until very late in the evening.	Oant hiel let op 'e jûn.
I can not wait to read much more from you.	Ik kin net wachtsje om folle mear fan jo te lêzen.
The first teacher of a boy may well be his mother.	De earste learaar fan in jonge kin wol syn mem wêze.
It may be his best film to date.	It kin syn bêste film oant no ta wêze.
Have no children.	Hawwe gjin bern.
Be better at it.	Wês der better yn.
They have to worry about it.	Se moatte har soargen meitsje.
I said it was nothing he had done wrong.	Ik sei dat it neat wie dat er ferkeard dien hie.
I told her nothing.	Ik fertelde har neat.
You may already know this and you may not.	Jo kinne dit al witte en jo miskien net.
One of those two must give.	Ien fan dy twa moat jaan.
And that's where a lot of it goes.	En dat is wêr't in protte fan it giet.
It worked earlier today.	It wurke earder hjoed.
He never gave up.	Hy joech noait op.
You do not know what you are talking about.	Jo witte net wêr't jo it oer hawwe.
They can not put it right.	Se kinne it net goed sette.
What does she want from us?	Wat wol se fan ús?
See them for what they are.	Sjoch se foar wat se binne.
In our city.	Yn ús stêd.
It would not be good.	It soe net goed wêze.
Not exactly, she said.	Net krekt, sei se.
I ate her out, again.	Ik iet har út, wer.
His dog was just awake.	Syn hûn wie krekt wekker.
From now on, everything you say goes.	Fan no ôf giet alles wat jo sizze.
But he does not want to help us either.	Mar hy wol ús ek net helpe.
This actually happened.	Dit is eins bard.
We only have two.	Wy hawwe mar twa.
They did well.	Dat diene se goed.
It's a good name.	It is in goede namme.
That's what it wants.	Dat is wat wol.
It was all mine.	It wie allegear fan my.
You can just take care of the baby.	Jo kinne gewoan foar it bern soargje.
She entered the house.	Se kaam it hûs yn.
And help say the.	En helpe se die.
You never know what you will find.	Jo witte noait wat jo sille fine.
I really want to do this.	Ik wol dit echt dwaan.
You can not just do.	Jo kinne net gewoan dwaan.
Afraid not to do.	Bang net te dwaan.
Or try to do something about it.	Of besykje der wat oan te dwaan.
She's been sick for a long time.	Se is lang siik.
I was not hard at work yet.	Ik wie noch net hurd oan it wurk.
They did not have it.	Se hiene it net.
I found it beautiful there.	Ik fûn it dêr moai.
Tell me one.	Fertel my ien.
And he still went on.	En hy gie noch troch.
There's a man, or there was.	Dêr is in man, of der wie.
And what are you.	En wat bist.
But it is not.	Mar it is net.
She would love this house.	Se soe fan dit hûs hâlde.
But, man, you can not find this woman her.	Mar, man, jo kinne dizze frou har net fine.
We were a day late.	Wy wiene in dei te let.
People can do whatever they want with that truth.	Minsken kinne mei dy wierheid dwaan wat se wolle.
For everyone.	Foar elkenien.
I'm pretty happy.	Ik bin aardich bliid.
You need to tell us something.	Jo moatte ús wat fertelle.
We just want what's best for everyone.	Wy wolle gewoan wat it bêste is foar elkenien.
Many of us care about family.	In protte fan ús soargje foar famylje.
This person never had a chance.	Dizze persoan hie nea in kâns.
Be a man, children.	Wês in man, bern.
That will not happen.	Dat sil net barre.
And just like that, it was done.	En krekt sa wie it dien.
It does not matter who you are.	It makket neat út wa't jo binne.
All the people in town.	Alle minsken yn 'e stêd.
But it did not show much.	Mar it liet net in bytsje sjen.
I can not wait to see what it is.	Ik kin net wachtsje om te sjen wat it is.
Maybe stay in and work around here.	Miskien bliuwe yn en wurkje om hjir.
Everyone is there for a reason.	Elkenien is der foar in reden.
For that reason, I wanted to try it.	Om dy reden woe ik it besykje.
And then it's gone.	En dan is it fuort.
There's a way to that city.	Der is in wei nei dy stêd.
She was too late for work.	Se wie al te let op it wurk.
That was fine with her, for once.	Dat wie goed mei har, foar ien kear.
I did not expect to do it.	Ik hie net ferwachte it te dwaan.
No longer angry with me.	Net mear lilk my.
He had two children.	Hy hie twa bern.
Love this so much.	Hâld dit safolle.
It's too easy.	It is te maklik.
I never want to see another movie.	Ik wol noait in oare film sjen.
She would be more hurt than angry, he thought.	Se soe mear sear wêze as lilk, tocht er.
And you probably will.	En jo sille wierskynlik.
They are not the problem.	Se binne net it probleem.
I do not feel that it is the same as the other.	Ik fiel net dat it itselde is as de oare.
When he spoke, it hit me.	Doe't er praat, rekke it my.
I do not think so.	Dat tink ik net.
That this was her last chance.	Dat dit har lêste kâns wie.
It's about you.	It giet oer dy.
Whatever it is.	Wat it ek is.
Now nothing matters.	No makket neat út.
A very good question.	In hiel goede fraach.
It was not a question.	It wie gjin fraach.
More than a few have not been so easy.	Mear as in pear hawwe net sa maklik west.
I just know people are scared.	Ik wit gewoan dat minsken bang binne.
You will not need it.	Jo sille it net nedich hawwe.
She may not think so, but she is.	Dat tinkt se miskien net, mar dat is se.
They are, really.	Se binne, echt.
He did not like to think about the other children.	Hy mocht net graach oer de oare bern tinke.
What they did without me being there.	Wat se diene, sûnder dat ik der wie.
He was angry at me and walked away.	Hy wie lilk op my en gie fuort.
This can happen once or twice a month.	Dit kin ien of twa kear yn 'e moanne barre.
Let her find you.	Lit har jo fine.
That can happen again.	Dat kin wer.
He should not be.	Hy soe net wêze moatte.
My parents work very hard.	Myn âlden wurkje hiel hurd.
It did not come easily this time.	It kaam dizze kear net maklik.
It was not hard to come by.	It wie net dreech om te kommen.
She had convinced me.	Se hie my oertsjûge.
I try both.	Ik besykje beide.
This was not done here.	Dit waard hjir net dien.
It did not matter now what she was looking at.	It makke no net út wêr't se nei seach.
Well, busy enough.	No, genôch drok.
I knew his wife very well and now they are together.	Ik koe syn frou hiel goed en no binne se tegearre.
I'm surprised at how well it works.	Ik bin ferrast oer hoe goed it wurket.
Come on.	Kom op.
He is not happy about that.	Dêr is er net bliid mei.
It was with him.	It wie mei him.
She wanted more time.	Se woe mear tiid.
His life is very difficult.	Syn libben is hiel dreech.
People help me.	Minsken helpe my.
In fact, they did not know it.	Eins wisten se it net.
This is our job.	Dit is ús wurk.
No one came in with her.	Der kaam net ien mei har yn.
Yesterday was that day.	Juster wie dy dei.
Please help me.	Help my asjebleaft.
I wanted to do one of these forever.	Ik woe ien fan dizze foar altyd dwaan.
In a year or two it could be.	Oer in jier as twa kin it wêze.
Try them and let us know how it goes !.	Besykje se en lit ús witte hoe't it giet!.
If it's not there, you can do it.	As d'r net is, kinne jo it meitsje.
I love my family and friends more than anything.	Ik hâld mear fan myn famylje en freonen dan wat dan ek.
You are just there to do the best you can.	Jo binne der gewoan om it bêste te dwaan dat jo kinne.
They can both.	Se kinne beide.
But not bad.	Mar net min.
She liked his way.	Se mocht fan syn manier.
You do not have to do this.	Jo moatte dit net dwaan.
The police are involved.	De plysje is der mei oan.
I'm getting old here.	Ik wurd hjir âld.
I had no time for that.	Dêr hie ik gjin tiid foar.
I can 't come to his office tonight either.	Ik kin fannacht ek net yn syn kantoar komme.
Don't you think we can ask for some help?	Tinksto net dat wy wat help freegje kinne?
I want you with me.	Ik wol dy by my hawwe.
Which she got.	Dy't se krige.
He the.	Hy die.
Wherever she can, she will make it.	Wêr't se ek kin, sil se it meitsje.
It's not for tomorrow.	It is net foar moarn.
We're going through this.	Wy geane troch dit.
No one wants to talk about getting married.	Net ien wol prate oer krije wol.
And that worked.	En dat wurke.
That's just not how it works.	Dat is gewoan net hoe't it wurket.
You have become so different.	Do bist sa oars wurden.
They need to love their children.	Se moatte fan har bern hâlde.
And when there were three, it felt like a lot.	En as it trije wiene, fielde it in protte.
I'll tell you more.	Ik sil dy noch wat fertelle.
Never do this.	Nea dwaan dit.
But he does not say.	Mar hy seit net.
She was very old.	Se wie tige âld.
And he ran out.	En hy rûn út.
This is a bad idea.	Dit is in min idee.
He looks at him.	Hy sjocht nei him.
Words are one thing.	Wurden binne ien ding.
A large lake.	In grutte mar.
But it was a beautiful girl.	Mar it wie in moai famke.
They do what they want us to do.	Se dogge wat se ús wolle.
It's enough money that you do not have to worry about.	It is genôch jild dat jo gjin soargen hoege te meitsjen.
He also asked if she could visit him.	Hy frege ek oft se by him besykje mocht.
I went out and bought them.	Ik gie út en kocht se.
We have more to talk about tomorrow.	Wy hawwe moarn mear te praten.
And do it right.	En doch it goed.
And he knew where he would find her.	En hy wist wêr't er har fine soe.
Yes.	Jo.
I should never have done it.	Ik hie it noait dien moatten.
It could really be both things.	It koe echt beide dingen wêze.
But one thing.	Mar ien ding.
Think before you speak.	Tink foardat jo prate.
You can see for yourself.	Jo kinne sels sjen.
It was as if she had been there.	It wie as hie se der west.
Maybe it was time to buy a new one.	Miskien wie it tiid om nije te keapjen.
But that was so long ago.	Mar dat wie sa lang lyn.
I had to find work myself.	Ik moast sels wurk fine.
So many words.	Safolle wurden.
We will know where we are going and why.	Wy sille witte wêr't wy hinne geane en wêrom.
But there was more.	Mar der wie mear.
I have to show you this.	Ik moat dy dit sjen litte.
I've never known anyone like you.	Ik haw noch noait ien ken as dy.
She did not have to do it.	Se hoegde it net te dwaan.
I've decided.	Ik ha besletten.
I got away in trouble.	Ik kaam fuort yn de problemen.
Just go back a little bit.	Gean mar in bytsje werom.
I wanted to be sure.	Ik woe der wis fan wêze.
I wondered what he was thinking.	Ik frege my ôf wat er tocht.
He works hard every day.	Hy wurket alle dagen hurd.
It is not good for that.	Dêr is it net goed foar.
If there is anything to be found.	As der wat te finen is.
Maybe look there.	Miskien sjoch dêr.
There is a plan.	Der is in plan.
We are tired.	Wy binne wurch.
I'm not doing this well.	Ik doch dit net goed.
However, this is some of the things you do not know.	Hoe dan ek, dit is wat fan 'e dingen dy't jo net witte.
He still loves her.	Hy hâlde noch fan har.
I know she did.	Ik wit dat se it die.
Well, he could not worry about that now.	No, dêr koe er no gjin soargen oer meitsje.
Tom has been as busy as last year.	Tom hat it like drok as ferline jier.
Tell me who did this.	Fertel my wa't dit dien hat.
I would say nothing.	Ik soe neat sizze.
It was a difficult weekend.	It wie in dreech wykein.
He might not get another chance.	Hy soe miskien gjin oare kâns krije.
There were no last words.	Der wiene gjin lêste wurden.
Has nothing to tell her.	Hat neat te fertellen har.
It just came out in the movie.	It kaam krekt út yn 'e film.
You've been there a long time.	Do bist der al lang by.
I hope this becomes true for you too.	Ik hoopje dat dit ek foar jo wier wurdt.
People knew her.	Minsken koene har.
And you're always with that girl.	En do bist altyd by dat famke.
Had no problems.	Hie gjin problemen.
He can go where he wants.	Hy kin gean wêr't er wol.
Or maybe he could not.	Of miskien koe er net.
There is no way now.	Der is no gjin wei.
It can only be one or the other.	It kin allinnich wêze ien of oare.
That's what he's trying to do.	Dat is wat er besocht te dwaan.
He was now a man.	Hy wie no in man.
And are a family.	En binne in famylje.
And he knows it too.	En hy wit it ek.
But in life it bought her time.	Mar yn it libben kocht it har tiid.
Look, everyone, there.	Sjoch, elkenien, dêr.
I'll have to get to work.	Ik sil oan it wurk moatte.
We just knew away.	Wy wisten gewoan fuort.
I wish you all the best.	Ik winskje dy al it bêste.
They are not talking to him, but the child.	Se prate net mei him, mar it bern.
It had to be the two.	It moast de twa wêze.
More would be better.	Mear soe better wêze.
We hope you enjoy the stay.	Wy hoopje dat jo it leuk fine om hjir te bliuwen.
But here is a lot to see.	Mar hjir is in protte te sjen.
But she wanted to show it to you.	Mar se woe foar dy sjen litte.
This house is old.	Dit hûs is âld.
But they have not.	Mar se hawwe net.
If it does well, they will make money.	As it goed docht, meitsje se jild.
I was very happy to do it.	Ik wie tige bliid om it te dwaan.
Did we do it all wrong.	Hawwe wy it allegear ferkeard.
Looked at me.	Seach my oan.
They are still here for you.	Se binne hjir noch foar jo.
This time of year.	Dizze tiid fan it jier.
But she had been wrong.	Mar se hie ferkeard west.
But where she came from did not matter.	Mar wêr't se wei kaam makke neat út.
Not just of the money kind.	Net allinnich fan it jild soarte.
Might be.	Kin wêze.
Everyone knew where and when we were coming.	Elkenien wist wêr en wannear wy komme.
She had no water.	Se hie gjin wetter.
That should be more than enough.	Dat soe mear as genôch wêze moatte.
He says it's easy to make.	Hy seit dat it maklik te meitsjen is.
Why, it does not matter.	Wêrom, it makket neat út.
He does not have to talk to you every day.	Hy hoecht jo net alle dagen te praten.
I love that guy.	Ik hâld fan dy keardel.
I could not wait to tell him.	Ik koe net wachtsje om it him te fertellen.
He is everything you want him to be.	Hy is alles wat jo wolle dat hy is.
It was never really a problem for us.	It wie noait echt in probleem foar ús.
Go for it, man.	Gean der foar, man.
It is clear that she has something more to say.	It is dúdlik dat se noch wat mear te sizzen hat.
I actually like the idea.	Ik hâld eins fan it idee.
There I got my name.	Dêr krige ik myn namme.
He was one of the two.	Hy wie ien fan de twa.
The idea is this.	It idee is dit.
It was my only hope.	It wie myn ienige hope.
I am.	Ik bin.
He did not seem to be.	Hy like it net te wêzen.
She will not let it happen again.	Se sil it net wer barre litte.
This is where the questions get really difficult.	Dit is wêr't de fragen echt dreech wurde.
This does not make my mother happy.	Dit makket myn mem net bliid.
And here she was.	En hjir wie se.
As long as you want or.	Sa lang as jo wolle of.
He was not told he was free to leave.	Hy waard net ferteld dat er frij wie om fuort te gean.
And in fact, that may be the problem.	En eins is dat miskien it probleem.
They have enough to say about this.	Se hawwe hjir genôch oer te sizzen.
They did not do so badly at that time.	Dat hiene se yn dy tiid net sa ferkeard.
She was very good at what she did, he knew.	Se wie hiel goed yn wat se die, hy wist.
No one in or out.	Nimmen yn of út.
I want more time.	Ik wol mear tiid.
He would get better.	Hy soe better wurde.
You are wrong here.	Jo binne ferkeard hjir.
He would be afraid of what he would tell him.	Hy soe bang wêze foar wat er him sizze soe.
So did your mother.	Dat die dyn mem ek.
You will be the next.	Jo sille de folgjende wêze.
Another guy did the same with the woman.	In oare keardel die itselde mei de frou.
I wonder why.	Ik freegje my ôf wêrom.
You are thirty.	Do hast tritich.
I know how busy you are.	Ik wit hoe drok do bist.
But it is necessary.	Mar it is nedich.
Those were there.	Dy wiene der.
We're in trouble.	Wy binne yn de problemen.
He would not stop this.	Hy soe dit net ophâlde.
Of course, we need to make something clear.	Fansels moatte wy wat dúdlik meitsje.
But she was happy.	Mar se wie bliid.
I might not be.	Ik soe miskien net wêze.
Admit that the money is not yours.	Jou ta dat it jild net fan jo is.
We will get things wrong.	Wy sille dingen ferkeard krije.
A man's dog.	In man syn hûn.
He was interested in her hand.	Hy wie ynteressearre yn har hân.
You can probably even think of a few.	Jo kinne wierskynlik sels in pear tinke.
I'm trying to find a house.	Ik besykje in hûs te finen.
I thought it was just me.	Ik tocht dat it krekt my wie.
And if not, then they are not.	En sa net, dan binne se net.
I can never be.	Ik kin noait wêze.
Do not wait any longer.	Wachtsje net mear.
You can tell by the.	Jo kinne fertelle troch de.
They are still with me.	Se binne noch by my.
I'm on my way there too.	Ik bin der ek op wei.
He wanted nothing more to do with this work.	Hy woe neat mear mei dit wurk te krijen hawwe.
Tell me about your day.	Fertel my oer dyn dei.
Me too, actually.	Ik ek, eins.
I should have stopped before he came.	Ik hie ophâlde moatten foardat hy kaam.
The photo.	De foto.
I wish you had.	Ik winskje dat jo hiene.
Maybe it will not either.	Miskien sil it ek net.
They're coming back.	Se komme werom.
That's nice.	Dat is it moai.
What is holding you back?!?.	Wat hâldt dy werom?!?.
I'm so happy to be here.	Ik bin sa bliid hjir te wêzen.
It cannot be done all at once.	It kin net yn ien kear dien wurde.
Many people do not grow old.	In protte minsken wurde net âld.
I walked to the door.	Ik rûn nei de doar.
You will need them.	Jo sille se nedich hawwe.
I thought we were family.	Ik tocht dat wy famylje wiene.
Must go.	Moat gean.
That he did not say exactly, but.	Dat sei er net krekt, mar.
It can also never be made.	It kin ek nea makke wêze.
I could not really figure out how to do this.	Ik koe net echt fine hoe dit te dwaan.
The children were at home and after school.	De bern wiene thús en nei skoalle.
She was still sitting in the car.	Se siet noch yn de auto.
Then we have enough.	Dan hawwe wy genôch.
He did not feel it even.	Hy fielde it net iens.
But it did not happen quite like that.	Mar it barde net hielendal sa.
I wish we had more time there.	Ik woe dat wy hiene mear tiid dêr.
It makes you better.	It makket dy better.
You talk to the family.	Jo prate mei de famylje.
It's true, it's true.	It is wier, it is wier.
Let me know.	Lit my mar.
No photo, no name for you.	Gjin foto, gjin namme foar dy.
Go where we are not.	Gean wêr't wy net binne.
They may work for you, even if not for me.	Se kinne wurkje foar jo, sels as net foar my.
Probably would not work for you.	Wierskynlik soe net wurkje foar dy.
I felt .	Ik fielde .
More than out of time.	Mear as út de tiid.
It was her.	It wie har.
Not even his wife can.	Net iens syn frou kin.
I have some food for you.	Ik haw wat iten foar dy.
Not to be.	Net te wêzen.
Man in his.	Man yn syn.
Girl goes home.	Famke giet nei hûs.
But this work is happy.	Mar dit wurk is bliid.
And even then.	En sels dan.
If you can get it, go for it.	As jo ​​​​it kinne krije, gean dan.
I was late for class.	Ik wie te let nei de klasse.
I should have been with you.	Ik hie by dy wêze moatten.
Or started to.	Of begûn te.
This you need to know.	Dit moatte jo witte.
From us to you.	Fan ús oan dy.
Buy some food.	Keapje wat iten.
Well, it's here.	No, it is hjir.
They never did, of course.	Se hawwe nea dien, fansels.
Please, go in.	Asjebleaft, gean yn.
They do not know where to go.	Se witte net wêr't se hinne moatte.
He thought he had a chance.	Hy tocht dat er in kâns hie.
Where were the children?	Wêr wiene de bern?
And he walks away.	En hy giet fuort.
One was today.	Ien wie hjoed.
It was not happy.	It wie net bliid.
It was long and hard work.	It wie lang en dreech wurk.
Now she knew why.	No wist se wêrom.
It could.	It soe kinne.
I want so badly that it's good.	Ik wol sa min dat it goed is.
And so that stayed with me.	En sa bleau dat my by.
That he would be different for her.	Dat er foar har oars wêze soe.
It made clear.	It die dúdlik.
Maybe you do too.	Miskien docht dy dat ek.
She ate everything.	Se iet alles op.
There is nothing to show that she knew anything about it.	Der is neat te sjen dat se der wat fan wist.
Someone will pay for it.	Der sil ien foar betelje.
A job, a job.	In baan, in baan.
I'm not going to talk to my dad.	Ik gean net mei myn heit te praten.
Never took it.	Nea naam it.
She knew she was beautiful.	Se wist dat se moai wie.
But make a lot.	Mar meitsje in protte.
One of my friends is in jail.	Ien fan myn freonen sit yn 'e finzenis.
He dies.	Hy komt om.
They will have children.	Se sille bern krije.
It works too.	It wurket ek.
He could do nothing about it.	Hy koe der neat oan dwaan.
We would get a lot of the money back.	Wy soene in protte fan it jild werom krije.
There is so much to do.	Der is safolle te dwaan.
I thought there would be.	Ik tocht dat der wêze soe.
He was her best friend.	Hy wie har bêste freon.
If one of them is better, then the other becomes ill.	As ien fan har better is, dan wurdt de oare siik.
The next thing she knew, it was gone.	It folgjende wat se wist, wie it fuort.
Not everyone can get everything they want.	Net elkenien kin alles krije wat se wolle.
I felt better.	Ik fielde my better.
Just give up too soon.	Jou net te gau op.
Do not enter now.	Jou no net yn.
I do not know how he knows, but he does.	Ik wit net hoe't er it wit, mar hy docht.
Maybe this was not what he had to ask, he thought.	Miskien wie dit net wat er freegje moast, tocht er.
Maybe, just maybe, this can work.	Miskien, krekt miskien, kin dit wurkje.
Forever this time.	Foar altyd dizze kear.
We can never get where we intend to go.	Wy kinne noait komme wêr't wy fan plan binne te gean.
I'm telling you.	Ik fertel dy.
Around me was the.	Om my hinne wie de.
It went well though.	It gie wol goed.
I do not even know if we can do something to her.	Ik wit net iens oft wy har wat dwaan kinne.
But really, like it.	Mar echt, like it.
So was he.	Sa wie hy.
All of them.	Allegear fan har.
You have to tell me the truth.	Jo moatte my de wierheid fertelle.
It was also a job for life.	It wie ek in baan foar it libben.
It's long gone.	It is al lang fuort.
I told you they were gone.	Ik sei dy dat se fuort wiene.
I'm not completely alone in this.	Ik bin hjir net hielendal allinnich yn.
Always just three.	Altyd krekt trije.
Her parents were different too.	Har âlden wiene ek oars.
Be your thing.	Wês jo dit ding.
Could do it.	Koe it dwaan.
We know what we have done.	Wy witte wat wy dien hawwe.
It's a name you speak.	It is in namme dy't jo prate.
Maybe he's a friend of yours.	Miskien is hy in freon fan jo.
And she's very good at it.	En se is der tige goed yn.
I'm there too.	Ik bin der ek.
She knew what he was asking of her.	Se wist wat er fan har frege.
He was too.	Hy wie ek.
And that makes him happy too.	En dat makket him ek bliid.
Still, everyone knows.	Noch, elkenien wit.
They can be.	Se kinne wêze.
He was not happy about that.	Dêr wie er net bliid mei.
This is exactly what is happening now.	Dit is no krekt wat der bart.
Where are they going?	Wer geane se hinne?
We need to eat that time.	Wy moatte dy tiid ite.
Will have to see.	Sil sjen moatte.
Happy with me.	Bliid mei my.
If you must have realized.	As jo ​​moatte hawwe realisearre.
She had never seen him before.	Se hat him noch nea earder sjoen.
Also they had found nothing.	Ek se hiene neat fûn.
Not thinking about it.	Dêr net oan tocht.
She was really very nice.	Se wie echt heul aardich.
And we put them there.	En wy sette se dêr.
But she really saw nothing.	Mar se seach eins neat.
I'm glad you have money.	Ik bin bliid dat jo jild hawwe.
He's the only boy here you can not have.	Hy is de ienige jonge hjir dy't jo net hawwe kinne.
I could not do without it.	Ik koe der net sûnder tinke.
He was never seen again.	Hy waard nea wer sjoen.
I said nothing in one way or another.	Ik sei neat op ien of oare manier.
I did not have to tell him.	Ik hoegde it him net te fertellen.
It's already morning.	It is al moarn.
Only, that's what it took.	Allinnich, dat is wat it nedich wie.
Please take me away from this place.	Nim my asjebleaft fuort fan dit plak.
A man and a woman.	In man en in frou.
I think we did a pretty good job with that.	Ik tink dat wy dêr aardich goed mei dien hawwe.
It seemed so long ago.	It like sa lang lyn.
I go from everything.	Ik gean fan alles op.
He obviously saw one now.	Hy seach fansels no ien.
For my mother and three children.	Foar myn mem en trije bern.
How much have you bought.	Hoefolle hawwe jo kocht.
I had not heard much of it.	Ik hie der net folle fan heard.
We will then have time to figure out what to do.	Wy sille dan tiid hawwe om út te finen wat te dwaan.
But he might not have.	Mar hy soe miskien net hawwe.
He thought and thought.	Hy tocht en tocht.
I see you have them.	Ik sjoch dat jo dy hawwe.
I'm not leaving him.	Ik gean net fan him ôf.
But there is a time and place for everything.	Mar der is in tiid en plak foar alles.
Was that it? 	Wie dat it?
There are three things we can do with our money.	D'r binne trije dingen dy't wy mei ús jild kinne dwaan.
He had a few days left.	Hy hie in pear dagen oer.
It's good.	It is wol goed.
Try to be better.	Besykje better te wêzen.
We're ready.	Wy binne klear.
The young woman had none of it.	De jonge frou hie der neat fan.
The door opened.	De doar gie iepen.
De does the work then away.	De docht it wurk dan fuort.
Maybe they had not heard it.	Miskien hiene se it net heard.
I've worked for you long enough.	Ik haw lang genôch foar dy wurke.
Where you have everything but nothing.	Wêr't jo alles hawwe, mar neat.
There is a time and a place for that.	Dêr is in tiid en in plak foar.
I really need to think.	Ik moat echt tinke.
If you need anything else, we'll tell you.	As jo ​​​​wat oars nedich hawwe, sille wy jo fertelle.
That should not be the case.	Dat moat net sa wêze.
I did not want to.	Ik woe net mar.
I have too.	Ik haw ek.
It does not always work.	It wurket net altyd.
He did not worry about his family.	Hy makke gjin soargen oer syn famylje.
Just like that time so long ago.	Krekt as dy tiid sa lang lyn.
Does he really care about himself?	Hat er it eins oer himsels?
I saw a guy actually buy one.	Ik seach in keardel eins keapje ien.
I can not see that.	Dat kin ik net sjen.
But there is also something else.	Mar der is ek wat oars.
So the everyone.	Sa die elkenien.
We'll tell you how.	Wy sille jo fertelle hoe.
But he could talk.	Mar hy koe prate.
I'm glad she's with me.	Ik bin bliid dat se by my is.
Such a photo.	Sa'n foto.
Come on, help a guy, it does nothing.	Kom, help in keardel, it docht neat.
We can talk about this here.	Wy kinne hjir oer prate.
That work is ready.	Dat wurk is klear.
In this city.	Yn dizze stêd.
I was not even home.	Ik wie net iens thús.
Have you seen a new movie lately?	Hawwe jo de lêste tiid in nije film sjoen?
They are too different.	Se binne te oars.
It seems to me that this should be good.	It liket my ta dat dit goed wêze moat.
It does not really speak against me.	It praat eins net tsjin my.
There's a movie of mine.	D'r is in film fan my.
I have nothing left.	Ik ha neat mear oer.
And we need to do more of that.	En dêr moatte wy mear fan dwaan.
I did not know where my children were, or my husband.	Ik wist net wêr't myn bern wiene, of myn man.
Here there is no hope.	Hjir is der gjin hope.
She had never asked before.	Se hie nea earder frege.
Neither do you.	Jo ek net.
Could and should not.	Koe en moat net.
Around that time, she met someone.	Om dy tiid, se moete immen.
I wish you well, beautiful girl.	Ik winskje dy goed, moai famke.
You look different.	Jo lykje oars.
She's talking to me.	Se praat tsjin my.
Or maybe it will.	Of miskien wol.
Which it probably does.	Wat it wierskynlik docht.
I had no wife all that time.	Ik hie dy hiele tiid gjin frou.
We knew very little about each other.	Wy wisten hiel min oer elkoar.
His wife and children were out there.	Syn frou en bern wiene der út.
Maybe it's someone who did not like me.	Miskien is it ien dy't my net mocht.
I asked her to come and stay with me.	Ik haw har frege om by my te kommen en te bliuwen.
But that was not how things worked.	Mar dat wie net hoe't dingen wurke wiene.
In a way it did, but not exactly.	Op in manier die it, mar net krekt.
But it's out there.	Mar it is der út.
I think so.	Ik tink wol.
Have no children just to have them.	Hawwe gjin bern gewoan om se te hawwen.
She had no idea what it was like to be a mother.	Se hie gjin idee hoe't it wie om mem te wêzen.
They are determined to continue until the last man is found.	Se binne besletten om troch te gean oant de lêste man fûn wurdt.
It's her idea.	It is har idee.
Just go back and wait.	Gean gewoan werom en wachtsje.
Admit it now.	Jou it no ta.
Here, take her.	Hjir, nim har.
His best days were a few years away.	Syn bêste dagen wiene in pear jier fuort.
You do not want to ask, you just want to take.	Jo wolle net freegje, jo wolle gewoan nimme.
The best of my life.	It bêste fan myn libben.
Everyone was talking to us.	Elkenien wie tsjin ús te praten.
She needed him.	Se hie him nedich.
He is here to give.	Hy is hjir om te jaan.
He did not say one.	Hy sei net ien.
The children were there.	De bern wiene der.
If it was still open.	As it noch iepen wie.
He has the.	Hy hat de.
Can of course.	Kin fansels.
It was not really a question.	It wie net echt in fraach.
You can see around the place though.	Jo kinne wol om it plak hinne sjen.
I only saw that a few times in my life.	Ik seach dat mar in pear kear yn myn libben.
I heard about it.	Ik hearde der oer.
All you can have.	Alles wat jo kinne hawwe.
He should be back tomorrow.	Hy moat moarn werom wêze.
It did not look good.	It seach der net goed út.
A girl and a boy.	In famke en in jonge.
Make it about them.	Meitsje it oer har.
Nice work!	Moai wurk!
What worked, worked.	Wat wurke, wurke.
Let us make this clear then.	Litte wy dit dan dúdlik meitsje.
My dad took time off work last week.	Myn heit naam ferline wike frij fan it wurk.
I'll say you said that.	Ik sil sizze dat jo dat sein hawwe.
You are something to see.	Jo binne wat om te sjen.
She actually said it more than once.	Se sei it eins mear as ien kear.
Let me show you something.	Lit my dy wat sjen litte.
A simple thing.	In gewoan ding.
We just have to wait and see.	Wy moatte gewoan wachtsje en sjen.
I'm interested in that person.	Ik bin ynteressearre yn dy persoan.
She is sure of nothing more.	Se is fan neat mear wis.
That's not how.	Dat is net hoe.
He was very tired.	Hy wie tige wurch.
In other,	Yn oare,
He will wait as long as necessary.	Hy sil wachtsje sa lang as nedich is.
I better get back home.	Ik kin better werom nei hûs.
We would find it.	Wy soene it fine.
I really think they should take it.	Ik tink echt dat se it nimme moatte.
You just have to make both.	Jo moatte gewoan beide meitsje.
Or you've had it.	Of jo hawwe it hân.
This will be more.	Dit sil mear wêze.
She does not tell me.	Se fertelle it my net.
I'll talk to Dad.	Ik sil mei heit prate.
Let me do that.	Dat lit my dat mar dwaan.
This bothered him very much.	Dit gie him tige oan.
We play a lot more.	Wy spylje folle mear.
He was just glad she was gone.	Hy wie gewoan bliid dat se fuort wie.
He just did his job.	Hy die krekt syn wurk.
Do you have a plan.	Hawwe jo in plan.
Let people talk as much as they want.	Lit minsken prate safolle as se wolle.
It will not be happy, but it will do.	It sil net bliid wêze, mar it sil dwaan.
More than ever before.	Mear as der ea west hat.
Those people are real.	Dy minsken binne echt.
You did them right.	Jo hawwe se goed dien.
There is simply no way around it.	Der is gewoan gjin wei om it hinne.
Together they go on.	Tegearre geane se troch.
Too scared to do anything.	Te bang om wat te dwaan.
I'm not quite sure how it happened.	Ik bin der net hielendal wis fan hoe't it bard is.
That made me feel good.	Dat makke my goed.
She was clearly at work.	Se wie dúdlik oan it wurk.
It's yours.	It is fan dy.
All we can say is watch the movie.	Alles wat wy kinne sizze is de film sjen.
The boy would never say.	De jonge soe nea sizze.
Not really my thing.	Net echt myn ding.
We have a plan.	Wy hawwe in plan.
Those kids of mine stay in there for hours.	Dy bern fan my bliuwe der oeren yn.
Nothing for us.	Neat foar ús.
It became a common thing.	It waard in gewoan ding.
Let your child be a child.	Lit jo bern in bern wêze.
Tell his mother.	Fertel syn mem.
To help people.	Om minsken te helpen.
We have two other children.	Wy hawwe twa oare bern.
This is how it goes.	Sa giet it.
There is nothing more to go into.	Der is neat mear om yn te gean.
I'm sure.	Ik wis.
It's just his way of talking.	It is gewoan syn manier fan praten.
They should see.	Se soene sjen moatte.
It all has to go.	It moat allegear gean.
It's what they want, and they have it.	It is wat se wolle, en se hawwe it.
He wanted them to know that he liked the idea.	Hy woe dat se wisten dat hy it idee leuk fûn.
We have to go now.	Wy moatte no fuort.
That's the.	Dat is de.
He will help me figure something out.	Hy sil my helpe wat út te finen.
But be careful here.	Mar wês foarsichtich hjir.
But it will come.	Mar it sil komme.
So it came through.	Sa kaam it troch.
I know she liked it.	Ik wit dat se it leuk fûn.
She was only here a month.	Se wie hjir mar in moanne.
He could not say exactly what that was.	Hy koe net sizze krekt wat dat wie.
No one has time left to read.	Nimmen hat tiid mear om te lêzen.
He set to work.	Hy sette oan it wurk.
Me, this is me.	Ik, dit bin ik.
Now let me ask you this.	No lit ik dy dit freegje.
When we buy.	As wy keapje.
They will do the same thing to you.	Se sille itselde ding mei dy dwaan.
He started for the house.	Hy begûn foar it hûs.
Many are still.	In protte binne noch.
There was no one here.	Der wie hjir net ien.
The man was angry.	De man wie lilk.
And then it's not nice.	En dan is it net moai.
A bit of both seems likely, but we can not really be sure.	In bytsje fan beide liket wierskynlik, mar wy kinne net echt wis wêze.
Her mother came to her.	Har mem kaam by har.
I can not see it.	Ik kin it net sjen.
Do not worry.	Meitsje jo gjin soargen.
Also that year.	Ek dat jier.
There was nothing more to say.	Der wie net mear te sizzen.
Someone who did not want him here.	Ien dy't him hjir net ha woe.
There was more at hand.	Der wie mear oan de hân.
I met you really, really.	Ik moete dy echt, echt.
I did know.	Ik wist wol.
Have no children	Hawwe gjin bern
That should have been enough.	Dat hie genôch wêze moatten.
Try it to see how you like it.	Besykje it om te sjen hoe't jo it leuk fine.
We were too late.	Wy wiene te let.
You do not want it.	Jo wolle it net.
What year is this ?.	Hokker jier is dit?.
But you are not free.	Mar do bist net frij.
I did not know how to do it.	Ik wist net hoe't ik it dwaan moast.
But he also did not want them to worry.	Mar hy woe ek net dat se har soargen meitsje.
Do nothing but that.	Doch neat oars as dat.
Now everything is working out well for him.	No wurket alles goed foar him.
Today she was for us.	Hjoed wie se foar ús.
None of this will be easy.	Gjin fan dit sil wêze maklik.
You can only get one chance, maybe you will not get any.	Jo kinne mar ien kâns krije, miskien krije jo gjin.
All morning at the office until three o'clock.	De hiele moarn op kantoar oant trije oere hinne.
And for me, there is no going back.	En foar my is der gjin wei werom.
Either way, it would be long enough.	Hoe dan ek, it soe lang genôch wêze.
The time is up!	De tiid is om!
As if this.	As wie dit.
This now happens once a week.	Dit barde no ien kear yn 'e wike.
Are you angry about what happened.	Binne jo lilk oer wat der bard is.
Well, it is not.	No, it is net.
But a little different.	Mar in bytsje oars.
I would know the truth!	Ik soe de wierheid witte!
I think you should keep it.	Ik tink dat jo it hâlde moatte.
I do not go without once a week.	Ik gean net sûnder ien kear yn 'e wike.
Everyone wants them.	Elkenien wol se.
You can do that better.	Dat kinne jo better dwaan.
All morning at the office.	De hiele moarn op kantoar.
That first week was really hard.	Dy earste wike wie echt dreech.
I saw them come and go.	Ik seach se komme en gean.
Maybe he knows something about it.	Miskien wit er der wat fan.
I had never enjoyed driving.	Ik hie it riden noait leuk hân.
That's what you told me.	Dat hawwe jo my ferteld.
They can take a few years and many hours.	Se kinne in pear jier en in protte oeren hawwe.
He wanted nothing to do with me.	Hy woe neat mei my te krijen hawwe.
He said he wants that.	Hy sei dat er dat wol.
Well, we have to do it this way.	No, wy moatte it op dizze manier dwaan.
She would not worry.	Se soe har gjin soargen meitsje.
To have nothing like other people.	Neat te hawwen as oare minsken.
This would be it.	Dit soe it wurde.
This man is so tall.	Dizze man is sa lang.
Around there and.	Om der hinne en .
My question is that he comes one two days one.	Myn fraach is dat hy twa dagen ien komt.
Even if they are somewhat off.	Ek al binne se wat ôf.
And he was angry, very angry.	En hy wie lilk, tige lilk.
Otherwise he was just beautiful.	Oars wie er gewoan moai.
They had no idea why.	Se hiene gjin idee wêrom.
Come, take a chance.	Kom, nim in kâns.
She wanted to tell him about her father.	Se woe him oer har heit fertelle.
Let me go back now.	Lit my no werom gean.
Maybe he shouldn’t.	Miskien moat er net.
We used to do that.	Dat diene wy ​​eartiids.
Who needs to know the words?	Wa moat de wurden witte?
I really do not want to see them either.	Ik wol se eins ek net sjen.
I'm going to.	Ik sil nei.
But it had happened.	Mar it wie bard.
Nothing was quite certain.	Neat wie wis wis.
Not that it was necessary.	Net dat it nedich wie.
I wanted to help you.	Ik woe dy helpe.
We're going again.	Wy geane wer.
People who help.	Minsken dy't helpe.
She did not even know what she was anymore.	Se wist net iens mear wat se wie.
It still stands.	It stiet noch.
The road.	De wei.
He would do anything.	Hy soe alles dwaan.
I was talking about what she was doing.	Ik hie it oer wat se die.
He walked back to his father's office.	Hy rûn werom nei it kantoar fan syn heit.
I would say it's pretty true, but you have to let it happen.	Ik soe sizze dat it moai wier is, mar jo moatte it barre litte.
It's like no one has lived here before.	It is as hat hjir noait ien wenne.
We were open about it.	Wy wiene der iepen oer.
There is truth.	Dêr is wierheid.
But after my time.	Mar nei myn tiid.
No one had even said a word to stop it.	Nimmen hie ek in wurd sein om it tsjin te hâlden.
And one of those people, for me, is me.	En ien fan dy minsken, foar my, is ik.
Everyone felt it.	Elkenien fielde it.
But to today.	Mar nei hjoed.
Nothing goes in there.	Der giet neat yn.
She could not believe what was happening.	Se koe net leauwe wat der bart.
My mother was not happy.	Myn mem wie net bliid.
They would pay.	Se soene betelje.
But there can not be much time.	Mar der kin net folle tiid.
It would not, it could not, it can not.	It soe net, it koe net, it kin net.
I know what it does.	Ik wit wat it docht.
A house needs people in it.	In hûs hat der minsken yn nedich.
We decided to make it a weekend.	Wy besletten om der in wykein fan te meitsjen.
She had him.	Se hie him.
But, of course, they had.	Mar, fansels, se hiene.
I'm arriving late.	Ik kom der let oan.
But he was not interested.	Mar hy wie net ynteressearre.
Or who she was.	Of wa't se wie.
Nothing stands in the way.	Neat stiet yn 'e wei.
I'm going back to see what they do.	Ik gean werom om te sjen wat se dogge.
I know there is more.	Ik wit dat der mear is.
I need this.	Ik haw dit nedich.
I'm definitely happy to go back.	Ik bin wis bliid om werom te gean.
We did.	Wy diene.
It's my way or no way.	It is myn manier of gjin manier.
None of this happens.	Gjin fan dit bart.
It will never be.	It sil nea wêze.
She really should.	Se soe echt moatte.
And saw you and your life.	En seach dy en dyn libben.
They could not, but they could.	Se koene net, mar se koe.
But not so much.	Mar net safolle.
At first he did not know where he was or why.	Earst wist er net wêr't er wie of wêrom.
I'm sure they should be.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se moatte wêze.
And hold, he would hold her hand.	En hâlde, soe er har hân hâlde.
Then we have.	Dan hawwe wy.
The best you have.	It bêste dat jo hawwe.
They were badly needed.	Se wiene hurd nedich.
I think it's going well.	Ik tink dat it goed komt.
That was all she was to him.	Dat wie alles wat se foar him wie.
I wanted to go home.	Ik woe nei hûs.
But there was more than that.	Mar der wie mear as dat.
He will probably buy a new car next year.	Hy sil nei alle gedachten takom jier in nije auto keapje.
Here's the problem with that.	Hjir is it probleem mei dat.
They often deal with the same problems.	Se dogge faak mei deselde problemen.
They worried.	Se soargen.
This is very well made.	Dit is hiel goed makke.
She was so happy.	Se wie sa bliid.
He liked it very much.	Hy fûn it hiel leuk.
I'm doing it to get through.	Ik doch it om troch te kommen.
I just want you to go.	Ik wol gewoan dat jo geane.
They can stay out of my life.	Se kinne út myn libben bliuwe.
If you do not like it, fine.	As jo ​​​​it net leuk fine, goed.
We do not know who our father was.	Wy witte net wa't ús heit wie.
Hold it in one hand.	Hâld it yn ien hân.
I looked over my past life.	Ik seach oer myn ferline libben.
I knew this was it.	Ik wist dat dit it wie.
Someone has to say it.	Immen moat it sizze.
I'm just an ordinary girl.	Ik bin mar in gewoan famke.
It had had its day.	It hie syn dei hân.
I did once.	Ik die ien kear.
But he found much more than that.	Mar hy fûn folle mear as dat.
Was it so.	Wie it sa.
It's a great opportunity.	It is in grutte kâns.
Everything you need.	Alles wat jo nedich binne.
He did not want people to ask him about it.	Hy woe net dat minsken him der nei freegje.
These must be done throughout the book.	Dizze moatte troch it boek dien wurde.
But they did say where.	Mar se hawwe wol sein wêr.
I could not have found one in time.	Ik koe net hawwe fûn ien yn 'e tiid.
I think you can do him good.	Ik tink dat jo him goed dwaan kinne.
He wasn't sure she was ready for that.	Hy wie der net wis fan dat se dêr klear foar wie.
Will be.	Sil wêze.
You say that.	Jo sizze dat.
This is obviously nothing like that.	Dit is fansels neat as dat.
They have not really heard.	Se hawwe net echt heard.
They were talking about me.	Se hiene it oer my.
It was getting late and he was tired.	It waard let en hy wie wurch.
Now he's gone.	No is er fuort.
I think these are not bad people.	Ik tink dat dit gjin minne minsken binne.
It's true, we're pretty good in the family.	It is wier, wy binne aardich goed yn 'e famylje.
Nothing like it.	Neat like it.
There was always more to get.	Der wie altyd mear te krijen.
It is and it should be.	It is en it moat wêze.
They were both more.	Se wiene beide mear.
So you can help them.	Sa kinne jo har helpe.
I had to get it back.	Ik moast it werom krije.
But it is there.	Mar it is der.
Where it is now.	Wêr't it no is.
He has worked hard all his life.	Hy hat syn hiele libben hurd wurke.
Well, they can not.	No, se kinne it net.
I had enough of that too.	Dêr hie ik ek genôch fan.
He was in her.	Hy wie yn har.
New people always do.	Nije minsken dogge altyd.
Late for dinner.	Let foar it iten.
She would not tell me.	Se soe it my net fertelle.
He made it clear that he did not want her anymore.	Hy makke dúdlik dat er har net mear woe.
She went inside.	Se gie yn.
This is our new life.	Dit is ús nije libben.
They are not coming back.	Se komme net werom.
Something can happen twice.	Der kin twa kear wat barre.
And she had just told him she loved him.	En se hie him krekt ferteld dat se fan him hâlde.
Well, good!	No, goed!
I've seen.	Ik ha sjoen.
And on to the next and the next.	En op 'e folgjende en de folgjende.
I still felt nothing.	Ik fielde noch neat.
Talking makes way for food.	It praten makket plak foar iten.
I do not go out much to eat these days.	Ik kom dizze dagen net folle út om te iten.
I do not want this.	Ik wol dit net.
She could not find it.	Se koe it net fine.
Not much to say.	Net folle te sizzen.
I have to go.	Ik moat nei.
You find the time.	Jo fine de tiid.
This is one.	Dit is ien.
This was good of him.	Dit wie goed fan him.
And he quit.	En hy die ôf.
This man is always talking about himself.	Dizze man hat it altyd oer himsels.
Her father will be home for dinner tonight	Har heit sil fannacht thús wêze foar iten
But that's not really the problem here.	Mar dat is hjir net echt it probleem.
It just seemed like the right thing to say.	It like krekt as it goede ding om te sizzen.
No one will believe a word she says.	Nimmen sil in wurd leauwe dat se seit.
Try it today to find out !.	Besykje it hjoed om út te finen!.
What's hard, man.	Wat dreech is, man.
You did not ask for anything here.	Jo hawwe hjir neat om frege.
She took a day off from work.	Se naam in dei frij fan it wurk.
I like it a lot.	Ik ha der hiel wat fan.
Not our problem.	Net ús probleem.
This is not easy for them.	Dit is net maklik foar har.
So he walked out of the room.	Sa rûn er de keamer út.
I do not know who your mother was.	Ik wit net wa't dyn mem wie.
They were angry.	Se wiene lilk.
He lets us talk about it.	Hy lit ús der oer prate.
I'll be with you.	Ik sil by dy wêze.
Or so she thought.	Of dat tocht se.
You have to think.	Jo moatte tinke.
She does not know why she says that.	Se wit net wêrom se dat seit.
It had many hours on it.	It hie in protte oeren derop.
I do not know who.	Ik wit net wa.
That was it.	Dat wie wol.
They knew what they were doing and their work was very good.	Se wisten wat se diene en har wurk wie tige goed.
Where he was not sure.	Wêr't er net wis wie.
He said it was not.	Hy sei dat it net wie.
Let her go now.	Lit har no gean.
Come on, think.	Kom op, tink.
There was only one thing to do.	Der wie mar ien ding te dwaan.
But neither could benefit from either.	Mar der koe gjin goed fan komme foar ien fan beide.
And so we talked.	En sa hawwe wy praat.
I have mine.	Ik haw myn.
But they are often not the best.	Mar se binne faak net de bêste.
That's the only way to do it.	Dat is de ienige manier om it te dwaan.
You do not love your husband.	Jo hâlde net fan jo man.
And two, nothing happens.	En twa, der bart neat.
Then it's wrong.	Dan is it ferkeard.
They want children.	Se wolle bern.
I got so much money.	Ik krige sa jild.
He knew what to do.	Hy wist wat er dwaan moast.
That should go.	Dat moat gean.
Nothing is given.	Der wurdt neat jûn.
But if she is.	Mar as se is.
He could or did not want to say anything about that.	Dêr koe of woe er neat fan sizze.
He felt a little better now.	Hy fielde him no wat better.
If you are not sure, take one.	As jo ​​​​net wis binne, nim dan ien.
Well, he thought.	No, tocht er.
Or more than that.	Of mear as dat.
I want you to tell me what you think.	Ik wol dat jo my fertelle wat jo tinke.
How would anyone know for sure ?.	Hoe soe immen witte foar wis?.
He needs to get something more for her.	Hy moat wat mear foar har krije.
What problems have you had?	Wat foar problemen hawwe jo hân?
Maybe not ever.	Miskien net ea.
That hurt too.	Dat die ek sear.
You're still here.	Do bist hjir noch.
But people do not think so.	Mar minsken tinke net sa.
Or maybe he would not.	Of miskien soe er net.
It did him very good already.	It die him al hiel goed.
Maybe there were more.	Miskien wiene der wol mear.
That would never happen now.	Dat soe no nea barre.
They do no good.	Se dogge gjin goed.
Go away now.	Gean no fuort.
It was all about her, not my problems.	It waard allegear oer har, net myn problemen.
You make me do all this.	Jo meitsje my dit alles dwaan.
I want them gone.	Ik wol se fuort.
I've been thinking for a long time about how to say this.	Ik ha lang tocht oer hoe't ik dit sizze moat.
I would not want that.	Dat soe ik net wolle.
We have worked hard.	Wy hawwe hurd wurke.
Sure, they had to tell you that was the meeting.	Wis, se hiene jo moatte fertelle dat dat de gearkomste wie.
He had found me.	Hy hie my fûn.
This man almost had me.	Dizze man hie my hast.
Come on.	Kom op.
We did not talk, but he looked at me.	Wy prate net, mar hy seach nei my.
No idea how that happened.	Gjin idee hoe't dat barde.
He was easy with his friends.	Hy wie maklik mei syn freonen.
The movie was actually really good.	De film wie eins echt goed.
I think he's coming here soon.	Ik tink dat er hjir gau komt.
She was not much better off.	Se wie der net folle better fan.
I'll be fine until tomorrow.	Ik sil goed wêze oant moarn.
Or a plan.	Of in plan.
They are no more.	Se binne net mear.
Can't think where you are.	Kin net tinke wêr't dy is.
Now is the time to grow old.	No is it tiid om âld te wurden.
We think the same.	Wy tinke itselde.
I do not know what to do, really.	Ik wit net wat te dwaan, echt.
Then that's what's happening.	Dan is dat wat der bart.
I felt sure she would help me.	Ik fielde der wis fan dat se my soe helpe.
But she could not think of that.	Mar dêr koe se net oan tinke.
Or he does, but he is not interested.	Of hy docht, mar hy is net ynteressearre.
I think what they are saying is true.	Ik tink dat wat se sizze wier is.
You are real and here with me.	Jo binne echt en hjir by my.
A lot could happen.	Der koe in protte barre.
He seems pretty happy now.	Hy liket no aardich bliid.
I love you, mind you.	Ik hâld fan dy, tink.
And little by little, life got better.	En bytsje by bytsje waard it libben better.
Give the man all the money you have!	Jou de man al it jild dat jo hawwe!
Take this and give it to your father.	Nim dit en jou it oan dyn heit.
Now she knew that was not the case.	No wist se dat dat net sa wie.
It's still there.	It is der noch.
Not even sure what about.	Net iens wis wat oer.
He also asked to be released tomorrow.	Hy frege moarn ek frij.
I have a lot of worries.	Ik haw in protte soargen.
You knew he would.	Jo wisten dat hy soe.
They take it.	Se nimme it.
We do not know what they can do.	Wy witte net wat se kinne dwaan.
In one way he is.	Op ien manier is hy.
Maybe you can help me.	Miskien kinne jo my helpe.
I found out something today.	Ik fûn hjoed wat út.
I felt bad about it.	Ik fielde my der min oer.
That was the best time.	Dat wie de bêste tiid.
Not when you think about it.	Net as jo der oer tinke.
Her mother would not have it.	Har mem soe it net ha.
It was a lot to do.	It wie in protte om mei te dwaan.
They would not leave.	Se soene net litte.
The one who loves us is here for us.	Dejinge dy't fan ús hâldt, is hjir foar ús.
This was good.	Dit wie goed.
You have to stop there.	Dêr moatte jo ophâlde.
But life goes on.	Mar it libben giet troch.
I did a few other things, too.	Ik die in pear oare dingen, te.
See if you need it.	Sjoch as jo it nedich hawwe.
I'm not through yet and he is not through.	Ik bin der noch net troch en hy is net troch.
There can be no one.	Der kin net ien wêze.
Not sure what.	Net wis wat.
And the first woman.	En de earste frou.
If it's your job, it's different.	As it jo wurk is, is it oars.
But it's about more than her.	Mar it giet om mear as har.
They are not hard to get.	Se binne net dreech te krijen.
So there was more to this.	Sa wie der mear oan dit.
They are in trouble.	Se binne yn de problemen.
I did not want to do anything with it.	Ik woe der neat mei dwaan.
I do not want you to be hurt.	Ik wol net dat jo sear wurde.
He can too.	Hy kin ek.
Someone needs to tell us what we did.	Immen moat fertelle wat wy dien hawwe.
It had been days and days.	It hie dagen en dagen west.
I'm true.	Ik bin wier.
There we are.	Dêr binne wy.
To not be pretty enough.	Om net moai genôch te wêzen.
I had never seen him like this before.	Ik hie him noch nea sa sjen sjoen.
I hope that is not true.	Ik hoopje dat dat net wier is.
Has something for everyone.	Hat wat foar elkenien.
Or car ?.	Of auto?.
Give this to your mother first.	Jou dit earst oan dyn mem.
I need one like that.	Ik ha sa'n ien nedich.
It was clear enough to me.	It wie my dúdlik genôch.
She was good.	Se wie goed.
Not that year, not year.	Net dat jier, gjin jier.
It went a little like that.	It gie in bytsje sa.
There's not really much happening here.	Der bart hjir eins net al te folle.
Everyone was working on something different.	Elkenien wurke oan wat oars.
Look at her.	Sjocht nei har.
See how you do it.	Sjoch hoe't jo dogge.
He could only hope that she was now waiting for him.	Hy koe mar hoopje dat se no op him wachte.
He could not talk for hours.	Hy koe gjin oeren prate.
But that was not good enough for her.	Mar dat wie har net goed genôch.
A forever home.	In foar altyd thús.
Keep this in mind.	Hâld dit yn gedachten.
I plan to go there in a few years.	Ik bin fan plan om dêr oer in pear jier te gean.
We never talk again.	Wy prate noait mear.
It just seems like there is so much that could have happened.	It liket gewoan dat d'r safolle is dat bard wêze koe.
We do not do that with the child.	Dat dogge wy net mei it bern.
This can not happen.	Dit kin net barre.
In truth, this has never been done before.	Yn wierheid is dit noch noait earder dien.
They need to stay where they are.	Se moatte bliuwe wêr't se binne.
What was left of it.	Wat bleau der fan oer.
She has not been so alone in her life.	Se hat yn har libben net sa allinnich west.
Boy, your mom had it.	Jonge, dyn mem hie it.
Let's go here.	Litte wy hjir hinne gean.
Says he needs the money.	Seit dat er it jild nedich hat.
But there is.	Mar der is.
I'll see if he will see you.	Ik sil sjen oft er dy sjen sil.
Better if he even knows, maybe.	Better as er sels wit, miskien.
About the car.	Oer de auto.
Remember, too.	Tink ek oan.
What they got.	Wat se krigen.
I will be there to help you if you need me.	Ik sil der wêze om jo te helpen as jo my nedich binne.
What would happen?	Wat soe der barre?
Day after day, week after week, year after year.	Dei nei dei, wike nei wike, jier nei jier.
It seemed like it knew something.	It like wol dat it wat wist.
Friends who were like family.	Freonen, dy't wiene as famylje.
Do as much work as you can in time	Doch safolle wurk as jo kinne yn 'e tiid
Everyone in the place came out.	Elkenien op it plak kaam út.
You and I, here, we can do that.	Do en ik, hjir, wy kinne dat dwaan.
Really, that's enough.	Echt, dat is genôch.
As if she was afraid of something.	As wie se bang foar wat.
I knew him.	Ik koe him.
On the day of the meeting.	Op de dei fan 'e gearkomste.
I do not want to stay here.	Ik wol hjir net bliuwe.
I wish you did not say that.	Ik winskje dat jo dat net sizze.
I saw enough.	Ik seach genôch.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
But I can find nothing about it.	Mar ik kin der neat oer fine.
You're an old man.	Do bist in âld man.
They would see.	Se soene sjen.
There had never been such an animal before.	Der hie noch noait sa'n bist west.
Here and here.	Hjir en hjir.
There could be no one.	Der koe gjinien wêze.
What is it?.	Wat is it?.
She looked at the children.	Se seach nei de bern.
And that was exactly what was needed.	En dat wie krekt wat nedich wie.
Very good then.	Hiel goed dan.
It works really well for almost everything.	It wurket echt goed foar hast alles.
We've been there and done that.	Wy ha der west en dat dien.
It was easy enough for two.	It wie maklik genôch foar twa.
It's such a good thing.	It is sa'n goed ding.
Or whether he wants to.	Of oft er dat wol.
It was not hard to come up with what he said.	It wie net dreech om út te kommen wat er sei.
Well, what does it matter.	No, wat makket it út.
It does not matter if and when this happens.	It makket net út oft en wannear dit bart.
I can not think so about it.	Ik kin der net sa oer tinke.
He's going to be there tonight.	Hy sil der fannacht by wêze.
We had nothing to do with it.	Dêr hiene wy ​​neat mei te krijen.
I'm sure that was right.	Ik bin der wis fan dat dat krekt wie.
She's not talking to me like she used to.	Se praat net mei my sa as eartiids.
She took the boy by the hand.	Se naam de jonge by de hân.
On my own.	Allinnich.
If she can.	As se kin.
I saw her again the next week.	Ik seach har de oare wike wer.
That's how people want me to be.	Dat is hoe't minsken wolle dat ik bin.
But you still have to think about tomorrow.	Mar jo moatte noch tinke oan moarn.
Here she was.	Hjir wie se.
I do not have much more to say really.	Ik haw net folle mear te sizzen echt.
Not much more than that.	Net folle mear dan dat.
Please help.	Help asjebleaft.
It was true, actually, and they knew it.	It wie wier, eins, en se wisten it.
It was late.	It wie let.
More than he knew of her.	Mear as hy fan har wist.
The moon rises every day and sets.	De moanne komt alle dagen op en giet ûnder.
One time is enough.	Ien kear is genôch.
I do not do that much.	Ik doch dat net sa folle.
I can see it for myself.	Ik kin it sels sjen.
She's sick.	Se is siik.
What ever happens, happens.	Wat ea bart, bart.
I do not need anything that money can buy.	Ik haw neat nedich dat jild kin keapje.
Then we will know more.	Dan sille wy mear witte.
So was the other guy.	Sa wie de oare keardel.
I did try.	Ik ha wol besocht.
They just say it and show it.	Se sizze it gewoan en litte it sjen.
If they can do it, so can you.	As se it kinne, kinne jo dat ek.
She worked long and hard.	Se wurke lang en hurd.
And do not worry about the office.	En meitsje jo gjin soargen oer it kantoar.
I have one.	Ik haw in.
The same is true at work.	Itselde is wier op it wurk.
I liked him well.	Ik mocht him goed.
That's all he needs.	Dat is alles wat er nedich hat.
A few may try to do this.	In pear kinne besykje dit te dwaan.
It must be very late.	It moat hiel let wêze.
And do not worry about me.	En meitsje jo gjin soargen oer my.
She would come in and talk to me every day.	Se soe komme yn en prate mei my alle dagen.
He wanted it bad.	Hy woe it min.
You have so much to say.	Jo hawwe safolle te sizzen.
He will help me a lot.	Hy sil my tige helpe.
Of course it would.	Fansels soe it.
I have to go back.	Ik moat werom.
I have no idea what the problem might be.	Ik haw gjin idee wat it probleem wêze kin.
We need to work on that.	Dêr moatte wy oan wurkje.
I knew better than that.	Ik wist better as dat.
And we need your help.	En wy hawwe jo help nedich.
This is you for everything that happens that makes you.	Dit jo foar alles wat bart dat jo makket.
It's not just.	It is net gewoan.
And it works well.	En it wurket goed.
She made him so.	Se makke him sa.
They hold you back.	Se hâlde dy werom.
I'm really, really sorry.	It spyt my echt, echt.
It doesn’t seem like much of a problem.	It liket net in protte fan in probleem.
Not out of here.	Net út hjir.
She knew she had to work hard.	Se wist dat se hurd wurkje moast.
It was not even a man.	It wie net iens in man.
Go and see.	Gean mar sjen.
We've seen this before.	Wy hawwe dit earder sjoen.
I was so very tired.	Ik wie sa tige wurch.
Tell everyone what we do.	Fertel elkenien wat wy dogge.
Now is the time to get involved.	No is it tiid om mei te dwaan.
Well, get over it.	No, kom der oer hinne.
There were no thoughts.	Der wiene gjin gedachten.
I would look into that.	Dêr soe ik nei sjen.
But they do not have to be.	Mar se hoege net te wêzen.
So we left last week.	Sa binne wy ​​ferline wike fuort gien.
I've been too scared.	Ik haw te bang west.
Not that that matters now.	Net dat dat no ta docht.
He was one of two when he first joined.	Hy wie ien fan twa doe't er foar it earst by kaam.
She ran over.	Se rûn oer.
I know how they do that.	Ik wit hoe't se dat dogge.
He is very nice.	Hy is hiel aardich.
We're not that good at it.	Wy binne der net sa goed yn.
And we are the same.	En wy binne itselde.
They had become frightened.	Se wiene bang wurden.
It was a homeless place.	It wie in plak sûnder hûs.
That's just fine, and that's fine.	Dat is gewoan sa, en dat is goed.
I've been around him.	Ik haw om him hinne west.
Will never happen.	Sil nea barre.
She gave them what we had.	Se joech har wat wy hiene.
I'm a girl.	Ik bin in famke.
He is always on time.	Hy is altyd op tiid.
He opened the door.	Hy die de doar iepen.
I had never met him.	Ik hie him nea moete.
It's clear she's having some trouble reading.	It is dúdlik dat se wat problemen hat mei lêzen.
One day it will just be too much for you.	Op in dei wurdt it gewoan te folle foar jo.
Look around.	Sjoch om dy hinne.
We are happy to help.	Wy helpe graach.
Or so everyone thought.	Of sa tocht elkenien.
I will do nothing wrong.	Ik sil neat ferkeard dwaan.
He was glad to see him.	Hy wie bliid om him te sjen.
I assume one is too hard.	Ik nim oan dat ien te hurd is.
And we do not know what to do.	En wy witte net wat te dwaan.
I would wake up.	Ik soe wekker wurde.
No police arrived on the scene.	Gjin plysje kaam op it plak.
They did not last long.	Se hawwe net lang.
But it turns out well.	Mar it komt goed út.
Girl it was.	Famke wie it.
It's so sick.	Dit is sa siik.
Here, in this room.	Hjir, yn dizze keamer.
Hold up! 	Ophâlde!
So it was the same house.	Sa wie it itselde hûs.
I was the one who came upon people.	Ik wie dejinge dy't op minsken kaam.
He could not get out of the car.	Hy koe him net út de auto komme.
It was the first film of its kind.	It wie de earste film yn syn soarte.
Go to his house and wait there.	Gean nei syn hûs en wachtsje dêr.
I assume you are not either.	Ik nim oan datsto ek net bist.
They would take care of it.	Se soene der foar soargje.
I've heard people say it does nothing.	Ik haw minsken heard sizzen dat it neat docht.
We just need your dad.	Wy hawwe gewoan jo heit nedich.
It was just my life.	It wie gewoan myn libben.
He too.	Hy ek.
I wonder how his day went.	Ik freegje my ôf hoe't syn dei gie.
It was immediately clear.	It wie fuort dúdlik.
He did not want any problems.	Hy woe gjin problemen.
I will never look back.	Ik sil nea werom sjen.
I had never lived in a house so long before.	Ik hie noch noait sa lang earder yn in hûs wenne.
You do not know what they are like.	Jo witte net hoe't se binne.
I do not really know what to say.	Ik wit net echt wat ik sizze moat.
He knew she could not, and you could.	Hy wist dat se it net koe, en do koe.
Right now there is no work in it.	Krekt no is der gjin wurk yn.
He had to make this work.	Hy moast dit wurk meitsje.
I will never see her again.	Ik mei har nea wer sjen.
All too clear.	Al te dúdlik.
They used to do everything together.	Se diene eartiids alles tegearre.
But she was exactly the same.	Mar se wie krekt itselde.
Maybe they have a problem, maybe not.	Miskien hawwe se in probleem, miskien net.
I looked at him.	Ik seach nei him.
But you know it was.	Mar jo witte dat it wie.
We would never do that.	Dat soene wy ​​noait dwaan.
But he has something on.	Mar hy hat wat oan.
It was here, right now.	It wie hjir, krekt no.
I can see again.	Ik kin wer sjen.
Will come to me.	Sil by my komme.
And no one else knows about it.	En nimmen oars wit der fan.
It did not matter what had happened from here on out.	It makke net út wat der fan hjir ôf bard wie.
You can handle this.	Jo kinne dit oan.
They were there to take it.	Se wiene der om it te nimmen.
It does not make you interested in reading '.	It makket jo net ynteressearre yn it lêzen'.
He did not wait.	Hy wachte net.
How is the city?	Hoe is de stêd?
That you will see when we get to where we are going.	Dat sille jo sjen as wy komme wêr't wy hinne geane.
The last child left home last week.	It lêste bern is ferline wike út hûs gien.
As if she had him.	As hie se him.
If she let me.	As se lit my.
I do not know if we can do much more.	Ik wit net oft wy folle mear kinne.
Water becomes	Wetter wurdt
It's hard not to like the man.	It is dreech om de man net leuk te hawwen.
He did not seem to have a name.	Hy like gjin namme te hawwen.
Give her hope.	Har hope jaan.
You've never been like this.	Jo hawwe nea west sa.
I do not think you can just go for it.	Ik tink net dat jo der gewoan nei gean kinne.
I'm not waiting.	Ik wachtsje net.
This is not clear at all.	Dit is hielendal net dúdlik.
Everything like that.	Alles wie der.
I feel that way.	Ik fiel it sa.
It had nothing to do with her.	It hie neat mei har te krijen.
I'm not coming to him.	Ik kom net by him.
You too know that.	Ek jo witte dat.
It's not a letter to you.	It is gjin brief oan dy.
Keep it up!.	Gean sa troch!.
I did not need.	Ik hie net nedich.
She was not real, there was nothing of it.	Se wie net echt, der wie neat fan west.
She said not a word.	Se sei gjin wurd.
A boy and a man.	In jonge en in man.
We are not there yet.	Wy binne der noch net.
I really need you.	Ik haw dy echt nedich.
They would do what they like.	Se soene dwaan wat se graach.
All we have heard is.	Alles wat wy hawwe heard is.
It's the other people.	It binne de oare minsken.
I've seen it.	Ik haw it sjoen.
The door opened.	De doar joech wei.
He knew what would happen.	Hy wist wat der bard wêze soe.
So many of us were.	Safolle fan ús wiene.
She could not do that to him.	Dat koe se him net dwaan.
I had no idea.	Ik hie gjin idee.
I was both people.	Ik wie beide minsken.
You are the first.	Do bist de earste.
I don’t talk much more about her.	Ik praat net folle mear oer har.
Often, of course, the parents were never found.	Faak binne de âlden fansels nea fûn.
This is my room, he thought.	Dit is myn keamer, tocht er.
That is what he would like, he said.	Dat soe er graach wolle, sei er.
And they were.	En se wiene.
She wasn't even sure she wanted it anymore.	Se wie der net iens wis fan dat se it mear woe.
Do what you have to do.	Doch wat jo dwaan moatte.
And a nobody.	En in nimmen.
She just wants to be a mom.	Se wol gewoan mem wurde.
I can never.	Ik kin noait.
He had never met her, never told her about it.	Hy hie har nea moete, noch noait oer har ferteld.
Let me know what you think.	Lit my witte wat jo dwaan wolle.
I really need it.	Ik haw it echt nedich.
He knew what to do.	Hy wist wat te dwaan.
Wait for everyone to get involved.	Wachtsje foar elkenien om mei te dwaan.
I have a few questions.	Ik haw in pear fragen.
No one knew him.	Nimmen koe him.
The child did well.	It bern die it goed.
I wanted to stay in there, of course.	Ik woe der fansels yn bliuwe.
I have not tried it since.	Ik haw it sûnt net besocht.
Just to see if she's there.	Krekt om te sjen oft se der is.
You really have to go, man.	Jo moatte echt gean, man.
Well, it's too late now.	No, it is no te let.
It had to happen.	It moast barre.
We can make it better than it was.	Wy kinne it better meitsje as it wie.
This is a party for you.	Dit is in feest foar dy.
He met my mother.	Hy moete myn mem.
But he did not.	Mar hy hoegde net.
It is obviously getting better.	It wurdt fansels better.
I knew what he was like.	Ik wist hoe't hy wie.
Tell her the truth.	Fertel har de wierheid.
Maybe I'm doing this wrong.	Miskien doch ik dit ferkeard.
I do not know about anyone else.	Ik wit net oer immen oars.
This book is for everyone and everyone.	Dit boek is foar elkenien en elkenien.
I could not even look at it.	Ik koe der net iens nei sjen.
He told us that.	Hy hat ús dat ferteld.
She was happy with it.	Se wie der bliid mei.
Or, it has.	Of, it hat.
Worked really well for him.	Wurke echt goed foar him.
If it would stop there.	As it dêr ophâlde soe.
I do not think so.	Ik tink net.
She was not sure exactly what to say.	Se wie net wis krekt wat te sizzen.
That could be me.	Dat kin ik wêze.
We got it wrong.	Wy hawwe it ferkeard.
Buy or not buy, that is the question.	Keapje of net keapje, dat is de fraach.
The police were tired and weary.	De plysje wie wurch en wurch.
That's how long.	Dat is hoe lang.
That's not good for me either.	Dat komt my ek net goed.
Friends are there for friends.	Freonen binne der foar freonen.
Now there.	No is der.
Take a room.	Nim in keamer.
I was with someone.	Ik wie mei immen.
They know there is something, but they can not get to it.	Se witte dat der wat is, mar se kinne der net by komme.
We'll see what happens this week.	Wy sille sjen wat der dizze wike bart.
Do not think.	Wol net tinke.
Now she might want to do that again.	No kin se dat miskien wol wer dwaan.
And that may just have been that he was surprised.	En dat kin gewoan west hawwe dat er ferrast wie.
It went bad.	It gie min.
I have two great children.	Ik haw twa grutte bern.
I think that was the problem.	Ik tink dat it probleem wie.
But she's not yours.	Mar se is net fan dy.
Must wish it.	Moat it winskje.
There is no girl with that name here.	Der is hjir gjin famke mei dy namme.
I just wanted to talk to her, talk to her.	Ik woe gewoan mei har prate, mei har prate.
Even among her friends.	Sels ûnder har freonen.
You did not come.	Do bist net kommen.
he asked me.	hy frege my.
They knew better.	Se wisten better.
You just want to be with me to hurt me.	Jo wolle gewoan by my wêze om my sear te meitsjen.
Hope is here.	Hope is hjir.
I can not find it.	Ik kin it net fine.
It's a good name.	It is in goede namme.
It could go on much, much differently.	It koe folle, folle oars gean.
He can not stand it.	Hy kin it net oan.
Nothing can be done about it now.	Dêr kin no neat oan dien wurde.
Even though.	Sels.
She could see well.	Se koe goed sjen.
You do not need a reason anymore.	Jo hawwe gjin reden mear nedich.
In a way, he was ready to do it.	Op in manier wie hy ree om dit te dwaan.
We can put that in there.	Dat kinne wy ​​der yn sette.
Your alarm clock was not on.	Jo wekker wie net oan.
Both of them knew that.	Dat wisten beide beide.
So the question may not be right for us.	Sa is de fraach miskien net goed foar ús.
Sure enough, one day he told me what to do.	Wis genôch, op in dei fertelde hy my wat te dwaan.
I never felt that way.	Dat fiel ik noait.
I see you again.	Ik sjoch dy wer.
People talk about me.	Minsken prate oer my.
We've already said everything.	Wy hawwe alles al sein.
I think you're in a very bad way when that happens.	Ik tink dat jo op in heul minne manier binne as dat bart.
The last two are husband and wife.	De lêste twa binne man en frou.
I seemed to be surprised.	Ik like ferrast te wêzen.
I'm going back to doing nothing.	Ik gean werom nei neat dwaan.
I think this guy thought he could do anything.	Ik tink dat dizze jonge tocht dat er alles dwaan koe.
I was in a place.	Ik wie op in plak.
Make them not seem to do.	Meitsje se net lykje te dwaan.
I will not wait for her then.	Ik sil dan net op har wachtsje.
It can not be just me.	It kin net allinnich ik wêze.
You're a woman.	Do bist in frou.
I'm not asking.	Ik freegje net.
They have been a couple for a long time now.	Se binne no al lang in pear.
Dad will love it.	Heit sil der fan hâlde.
Of course it is, it has to be.	Fansels is it, it moat wêze.
This is where we come in handy.	Dit is wêr't wy komme troch.
We have to leave it there.	Wy moatte it dêr litte.
Although there is not much of it here.	Al is d'r hjir net folle fan.
And other things, what he wanted to tell me.	En oare dingen, wat er my fertelle woe.
Lots and lots of money.	In protte en in protte jild.
He can not stay.	Hy kin net bliuwe.
I'll see you.	Ik sil dy sjen.
He had heard the name before.	Hy hie de namme earder heard.
But it works for us.	Mar it wurket foar ús.
You did not eat.	Jo hawwe net iten.
And of course she had help.	En fansels hie se help.
The other children.	De oare bern.
I'm not asking you to do that.	Ik freegje net dat jo dat dogge.
Not one of us is.	Net ien fan ús is.
I just, the time was up.	Ik gewoan, de tiid wie om.
The alarm clock woke him up.	De wekker makke him wekker.
He is one of us.	Hy is ien fan ús.
It's gone forever.	It is foar altyd fuort.
It's much better.	It is folle better.
Maybe it just felt good to you.	Miskien fielde it foar jo gewoan goed.
I'm kind of a.	Ik bin in soarte fan in.
And he had read it.	En hy hie it lêzen.
I would not know what I would say to him.	Ik soe net witte wat ik tsjin him sizze soe.
Do not do this.	Doch dit net.
We will try it your way.	Wy sille it op jo manier besykje.
I feel good about it now.	Ik fiel my der no goed yn.
So it was now for me.	Sa wie it no foar my.
I had to do something.	Ik moast wat dwaan.
Let him out of there.	Lit him der út.
Now they are in the way.	No binne se yn 'e wei.
He walked away.	Hy rûn fuort.
Now we're going home.	No geane wy ​​nei hûs.
Let things even for tomorrow.	Lit dingen sels foar moarn litte.
I just had to be on hand to help.	Ik moast gewoan by de hân wêze om te helpen.
I'm coming back and we're leaving.	Ik kom werom en wy geane.
Need more than one guy, for sure.	Mear dan in keardel nedich, foar wis.
I'm afraid he'll never get out of there.	Ik bin bang dat er der noait út komt.
There would be no more.	Der soe net mear wêze.
Of course we win.	Fansels winne wy.
A hard life.	In hurd libben.
I'm not now.	Ik bin no net.
We said we would.	Wy seine dat wy soene.
She will be happy to see you.	Se sil bliid wêze om dy te sjen.
You're tired of being hurt.	Jo binne wurch fan sear wurden.
She was not a pretty girl.	Se wie net in moai famke.
I was very glad I could help her.	Ik wie tige bliid dat ik har helpe koe.
So much for being best friends.	Safolle om bêste freonen te wêzen.
I have to show them.	Ik moat se sjen litte.
I have no idea.	Ik ha gjin idee.
So far, everything has worked out well.	Oant no ta wurke alles goed.
It will be this one.	It sil dizze wêze.
Anyone can be one.	Elkenien kin ien wêze.
I have not heard from her since.	Ik haw sûnt neat fan har heard.
This is a good question.	Dit is in goede fraach.
I walked away, to school.	Ik rûn fuort, nei skoalle.
I was just trying to hold on tight.	Ik besocht gewoan hurd te hâlden.
Been there and done that.	Der west en dat dien.
Look carefully.	Sjoch foarsichtich om.
You would not even have to give her the things.	Jo soene har de dingen net iens hoege te jaan.
There is no more.	Der is net mear.
He thought his guy could go, and he did not.	Hy tocht dat syn keardel gean koe, en hy die net.
She looked at nothing.	Se seach nei neat.
And so many of us do.	En safolle fan ús dogge.
They need to get it right.	Se moatte it goed krije.
But it did not work.	Mar it hat net wurke.
They had left home only hours earlier.	Se wiene mar oeren earder fan hûs gien.
You just have to know how to do it right.	Jo moatte gewoan witte hoe't jo it goed dwaan.
As if she was more than that.	As wie se mear as dat.
Where are we going from here ?.	Wêr geane wy ​​hjir wei?.
The book is good, he said, but.	It boek is goed, sei er, mar.
There were still two months to go.	Der wiene noch twa moanne te gean.
I was pretty sure that would happen.	Ik wie frij wis dat dat barre soe.
They just need to know.	Se moatte it gewoan witte.
A few do that.	In pear dogge dat.
My wife does this here.	Myn frou docht dit hjir.
She did not know where to go.	Se wist net wêr't se hinne moast.
I really do not know what to do.	Ik wit echt net wat ik dwaan moat.
Better to do the job.	Better om it wurk te dwaan.
Sure there is bad.	Wis is der min.
He looked tired.	Hy seach wurch.
They did not have much of anything.	Se hiene net folle fan alles.
I can not stay.	Ik kin net bliuwe.
See you tomorrow.	Sjoch dy moarn.
That.	Dat.
I want to meet her.	Ik wol har moete.
He only hoped she would not ask.	Hy hope allinnich dat se net freegje soe.
She will not do this to him.	Se sil him dit net dwaan.
I knew this day would come.	Ik wist dat dizze dei komme soe.
They are many now.	Se binne no in protte.
It was the weekend.	It wie it wykein.
And he knew they did.	En hy wist dat se it diene.
I would love to see him.	Ik soe him graach sjen wolle.
It does not matter.	It makket neat út.
And she was good.	En se wie goed.
No more people.	Gjin minsken mear.
What time is it? 	Hoe let is it?
asked the man.	frege de man.
She was not ready.	Se wie net klear.
I knew him from before.	Ik koe him fan earder.
Good for everyone.	Goed foar elkenien.
But he told her about his mother.	Mar hy fertelde har fan syn mem.
This can not be good.	Dit kin net goed wêze.
That's what matters, he thought.	Dêr komt it oan, tocht er.
It had never been much.	It hie nea folle west.
Well, that's so good.	No, dat is sa goed.
It is not a very good book.	It is net in hiel goed boek.
He knew he was still on, so early.	Hy wist dat er noch op wie, sa betiid.
She was happy to go with him.	Se wie bliid om mei him te gean.
That it was never to hurt you.	Dat it wie noait om dy sear te dwaan.
All the way.	Hielendal.
One day, of course.	Ien dei, fansels.
Something for everyone.	Wat foar elkenien.
He had said what he had to say and that was that.	Hy hie sein wat er sizze moast en dat wie dat.
It's not that easy to find.	It is net sa maklik te finen.
I always waited for him to tell.	Ik wachte altyd op him om te fertellen.
I do not think of food.	Ik tink net oan iten.
Be kind and help if you can.	Wês aardich en help as jo kinne.
The young woman stopped talking.	De jonge frou hâlde op mei praten.
It makes me happy.	It makket my bliid.
A man must be himself.	In man moat himsels wêze.
There are a few who would like both.	D'r binne in pear dy't beide graach wolle.
The best kind.	De bêste soarte.
I put to work.	Ik sette oan it wurk.
Somehow, he did not think so.	Op ien of oare manier, tocht er net.
It does not matter what.	It makket neat út wat.
I'm so sorry, 'she said.	It spyt my sa,' sei se.
Do not just be in the room or eating with her.	Wês net gewoan yn 'e keamer of by it iten mei har.
You have to help me.	Jo moatte my helpe.
More money this time.	Mear jild dizze kear.
He is not wrong.	Hy is net ferkeard.
It was someone.	It wie immen.
So much more.	Safolle mear.
That will not scare me.	Dat sil my net bang meitsje.
It would be easy if they were.	It soe maklik wêze as se wiene.
Many of us still do not know how to do it.	In protte fan ús witte noch altyd net hoe't se it moatte dwaan.
We get nothing now.	Wy krije no neat.
How do you get there?	Hoe komme jo?
She continued.	Se bleau troch.
I am tired.	Ik bin wurch.
Come back you said.	Kom werom sei jo.
We will not be.	Wy sille net wêze.
He does not.	Hy net.
I wanted more than that.	Ik woe mear as dat.
Tell no one else.	Fertel nimmen oars.
I do not know what it's about.	Ik wit net wêr't it oer giet.
It just gets better.	It wurdt gewoan better.
It seemed they did not.	It like dat se net diene.
Now two days.	No twa dagen.
It's very good.	It is hiel goed.
He has been in prison since then.	Hy sit sûnt dy tiid yn de finzenis.
I did it myself.	Ik die it sels.
I'm sure it's going well.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it goed komt.
But that was exactly what it was not.	Mar dat wie krekt wat it net wie.
He should work on that.	Dêr soe er oan wurkje moatte.
I agree with that.	Dêr bin ik it mei iens.
I had been to school.	Ik hie op skoalle west.
Everything had its place, me too.	Alles hie syn plak, ek ik.
What happen.	Wat is der bard.
This has not happened so far.	Dit is oant no ta net bard.
I want to make sure you're fine.	Ik wol der wis fan wêze dat jo goed binne.
If we only knew what was coming.	As wy mar wisten wat der komme soe.
They like to do it.	Se dogge it graach.
I think it's here.	Ik tink dat it hjir is.
Well, it's time to do it.	No, it is tiid om it te dwaan.
Well, maybe happy.	No, miskien bliid.
You need to stay clear.	Jo moatte dúdlik bliuwe.
I love everything.	Ik hâld fan alles.
I'm not buying any of this.	Ik keapje neat fan dit.
One of our best.	Ien fan ús bêste.
The children must have seen their father do this.	De bern moatte har heit dit dwaan sjoen hawwe.
And you should get every opportunity to be at your best.	En jo moatte alle kâns krije om op jo bêste te wêzen.
He did that well.	Hy die dat goed.
I know about him, just.	Ik wit fan him, gewoan.
But now they can no longer just talk about it.	Mar no kinne se der net mear gewoan oer prate.
You have to leave before he gets here.	Jo moatte fuort foardat hy hjir komt.
I have read it two or three times.	Ik haw it twa of trije kear lêzen.
It's not my best.	It is net myn bêste.
I did not even have to come to you.	Ik hoegde dy net iens te kommen.
Everything to keep talking about.	Alles om te hâlden fan praten.
So you get a movie made about you.	Sa krije jo in film oer dy makke.
Only not today.	Allinnich net hjoed.
She was home.	Se wie thús.
Or we can do it together.	Of wy kinne it tegearre dwaan.
It's not just the school.	It is net allinnich de skoalle.
She looked very surprised.	Se seach der tige ferrast út.
And you know she has no problems.	En jo witte dat se gjin problemen hat.
One day at a time.	Ien dei op 'e tiid.
The problem was that they were hard to come by.	It probleem wie dat se dreech te kommen wiene.
I have nothing to say this week.	Ik haw dizze wike neat te sizzen.
This must stop.	Dit moat ophâlde.
But this, well this is different.	Mar dit, goed dit is oars.
He used to be one of those kids.	Hy wie earder ien fan dy bern.
Today he saw them.	Hjoed seach er se.
But we both love it.	Mar wy hâlde der beide fan.
No one will know.	Nimmen sil it witte.
We all hope for the best for him.	Wy hoopje allegear op it bêste foar him.
You can create a new photo.	Jo kinne in nije foto meitsje.
No one will ever find her.	Nimmen sil se ea fine.
I've never been like this before.	Ik haw noch noait sa west.
There is more to come.	Der komt noch mear.
I wanted to know everything.	Ik woe alles witte.
I've always been the problem kid.	Ik haw altyd it probleem bern west.
Never been before.	Noch noait earder west.
Of course, his name is already out there.	Fansels, syn namme is der al út.
She was with her when it happened.	Se wie by har doe't it barde.
Do not be angry.	Wês net lilk.
Not much more than that.	Net folle mear as dat.
She wanted to go to the door.	Se woe nei de doar.
Not just me, but them too.	Net allinnich ik, mar se ek.
I had work to do.	Ik hie wurk te dwaan.
Everyone knows you are.	Elkenien wit dat jo binne.
This was not so.	Dit wie net sa.
But we did not do that.	Mar dat hawwe wy net dien.
Try to get some money for it.	Besykje der wat jild foar te krijen.
So he stayed.	Sa bleau er.
It was never enough.	It wie nea genôch.
But he made our house a house.	Mar hy makke ús hûs in hûs.
I'm as good as you.	Ik bin sa goed as dy.
It became clear that she was very angry.	It waard dúdlik dat se tige lilk wie.
I have since we were three.	Ik haw sûnt wy trije wiene.
You just have to tell them, that's all.	Jo moatte har gewoan fertelle, dat is alles.
You get to see them a lot.	Jo krije se in protte te sjen.
Mom was beautiful.	Mem wie moai.
I will believe.	Ik sil leauwe.
He was really here.	Hy wie hjir echt.
I see you at school that morning.	Ik sjoch dy moarn op skoalle.
Of course, I'm not entirely sure.	Fansels bin ik der net hielendal wis fan.
They will come home.	Se sille thús komme.
Now she wants to go home.	No woe se thús.
His mother heard it too.	Syn mem hearde it ek.
He also did not know why that was so.	Hy wist ek net wêrom dat sa wie.
I still remember what it was like.	Ik wit noch hoe't it wie.
She lives alone.	Se wennet allinnich.
He can do anything he wants in life.	Hy kin alles dwaan wat er wol yn it libben.
It was never friends with me.	It wie nea freonen mei my.
Not from him and you in bed but from something else.	Net fan him en dy op bêd mar fan wat oars.
Of course, he would have much more than that.	Fansels soe hy folle mear hawwe as dat.
I would not say.	Ik soe sizze net.
Was not at all in the house.	Wie hielendal net yn 'e hûs.
This is obviously wrong.	Dit is fansels ferkeard.
They could not be more wrong.	Se koene net mear ferkeard wêze.
Looks like he's there now.	It liket derop dat er dêr no is.
Many things that happened.	In protte dingen dy't barde.
But if she's here, she's probably going to know.	Mar as se hjir is, sil se it miskien wol witte.
It all gets better.	It wurdt allegear better.
She's alone here, in this room.	Se is allinnich hjir, yn dizze keamer.
She would have to think of something else.	Se soe oan wat oars tinke moatte.
We were ready to go.	Wy wiene klear om te gean.
He does not talk much, but it comes.	Hy praat net folle, mar it komt.
This is not likely to be true	Dit is net wierskynlik wier te wêzen
Here is a picture of my house.	Hjir is in foto fan myn hûs.
There will be morning for that.	Dêr sil de moarn foar wêze.
I am a man of my word.	Ik bin in man fan myn wurd.
They were there now.	Se wiene der no.
I just sat and looked interested.	Ik siet gewoan en seach ynteressearre.
When it's gone, it's gone!	As it fuort is, is it fuort!
Mine has been better.	Myn is better west.
This also seemed very real.	Dit like ek hiel echt.
How it should be.	Hoe't it moat.
She wants to work for the city.	Se wol foar de stêd wurkje.
She wanted a father.	Se woe in heit hawwe.
So it works so well.	Sa wurket it sa goed.
You need to have something that people can pay you to do.	Jo moatte wat hawwe dat minsken jo kinne betelje om te dwaan.
I believe them.	Ik leau se.
Buy it here.	Keapje it hjir.
She looked at him.	Se seach him oan.
That's not who he is.	Dat is net wa't er is.
I can not stay.	Ik kin net bliuwe.
Soon he saw that the man only wanted money.	Al gau seach er dat de man allinnich mar jild woe.
He would not agree with it.	Hy soe it der net mei iens wêze.
I will be.	Ik sil wêze.
There was nothing else to do.	Der hoegde neat oars te dwaan.
I sat alone.	Ik siet allinnich.
He was very worried.	Hy wie tige soargen.
The work is hard.	It wurk is hurd.
Now he knows better.	No wit er better.
We need to do something.	Wy moatte wat dwaan.
It's what we do for a living.	It is wat wy dogge foar in libben.
He loves being with people and is good with children.	Hy hâldt fan wêzen mei minsken en is goed mei bern.
I've never seen this before.	Ik haw dit noait earder sjoen.
I had asked him what he was doing.	Ik hie him frege wat er die.
Think about what happened.	Tink oer wat der bard is.
Tom walked to the lake.	Tom rûn nei de mar.
I had never seen one before.	Ik hie noch noait ien sjoen.
Good on her.	Goed op har.
She never hurt him once.	Se hat him noait ien kear sear makke.
All things that are not really true.	Allegear dingen dy't net echt wier binne.
His wife knew otherwise.	Syn frou wist oars.
You can not reach these people.	Jo kinne net by dizze minsken komme.
We get things done.	Wy krije dingen dien.
It was not wrong.	It wie net ferkeard.
He knew nothing of this.	Hy wist hjir neat fan.
I can know last night about my father.	Ik kin fannacht witte oer myn heit.
That is not so.	Dat is net sa.
Even sure he will have read very well.	Sels wis dat hy in heul goed lêzen sil hawwe.
We will never be completely sure.	Wy sille noait hielendal wis wêze.
Anyone can see.	Elkenien kin sjen.
She asked me. 	Se frege my. 
people like.	minsken graach.
And it was even better this time.	En it wie dizze kear noch better.
I know it was good.	Ik wit dat it goed wie.
It's like you've not seen him.	It is as hiest him net sjoen.
It will not work.	It sil net wurkje.
It's hard.	It is dreech.
We need to work to remove the demand.	Wy moatte wurkje om de fraach fuort te nimmen.
And now it may be too late.	En no kin it te let wêze.
We know it makes money.	Wy witte dat it jild makket.
I can not believe it has come.	Ik kin it net leauwe dat it kommen is.
I would not just worry about those things.	Ik soe my net gewoan soargen meitsje oer dy dingen.
We'll be there first.	Wy sille der earst wêze.
All this time.	Al dizze tiid.
That book is not mine.	Dat boek is net fan my.
Everyone said it.	Elkenien sei it.
Even if you think it is, it probably is not.	Sels as jo tinke dat it is, is it wierskynlik net.
No way.	Echt net.
That's coming out now.	Dat komt no út.
I never met him.	Ik haw him noait moete.
I can do anything for you.	Ik kin dy alles dwaan.
That should not create any problems for you.	Dat soe gjin problemen foar jo moatte meitsje.
Things to do and not to do.	Dingen om te dwaan en net te dwaan.
It did not occur to her.	It kaam har net op.
They already had my money.	Se hiene myn jild al.
More people, more food, are coming for them.	Mear minsken, mear iten, komme foar har.
But he's just wrong.	Mar hy is gewoan ferkeard.
Or so from the first.	Of sa fan it earste ôf.
I ran out of time.	Ik rûn út de tiid.
Many believe that there is only one true faith.	In protte leauwe dat d'r mar ien wier leauwe is.
There is a lot to do.	Der is in protte te dwaan.
I was glad I was done.	Ik wie bliid dat ik dien wie.
It just happens what happens.	It bart gewoan wat der bart.
Much more interested.	In protte mear ynteressearre.
You go and see him.	Jo geane en sjoch him.
This should never happen.	Dit moat nea barre.
I do not know it at all.	Ik wit it net hielendal.
Someone is coming.	Der komt ien.
That did not really happen to us.	Dat is by ús net echt bard.
I wanted them at home.	Ik woe se thús.
I had to over.	Ik moast oer.
But no one would do it.	Mar nimmen soe it dwaan.
He got worried about it.	Hy krige der soargen oer.
You can do the same thing.	Jo kinne itselde ding dwaan.
I'm not in a good place.	Ik bin net op in goed plak.
That's our father.	Dat is ús heit.
It was just that.	It wie gewoan dat.
But there is absolutely no help for these people.	Mar der is hielendal gjin help foar dizze minsken.
I made one.	Ik makke der ien.
Never seen anyone with.	Nea sjoen immen mei.
I died on the way out.	Ik stoar op 'e wei út.
Maybe it's a classy thing.	Miskien is dit in klasse ding.
The water was very bad.	It wetter wie tige min.
But be careful.	Mar wês foarsichtich.
He did not even know how he got here.	Hy wist net iens hoe't er hjir kaam.
For good reason.	Om goede reden.
The old man told her many things.	De âld man fertelde har in protte dingen.
Until it is obviously not.	Oant it is fansels net.
Time would do what it did with people.	De tiid soe dwaan wat it die mei minsken.
He's not talking.	Hy praat net.
There was something wrong with me.	Der wie wat mei my.
You can, you can do it all.	Jo kinne, jo kinne it hielendal dwaan.
Time was like nothing.	De tiid wie as neat.
At the time, this was a common thing.	Yn dy tiid wie dit in gewoan ding.
I would have done the same.	Ik soe itselde dien hawwe.
Friend of my mother.	Freon fan myn mem.
Talk to me.	Praat mei my.
But do not ask, do not tell.	Mar freegje net, fertel net.
They could do nothing with him.	Se koene neat mei him dwaan.
And how much it is.	En hoefolle it is.
She really did not care about anyone or anything.	Se hie it echt net om ien of wat.
This is what we want to do.	Dit is wat wy wolle dwaan.
But she's wrong.	Mar se is ferkeard.
To take you back with me.	Om dy werom te nimmen mei my.
And we're told we can 't handle it.	En wy wurde ferteld dat wy it net oan kinne.
Maybe it's the only thing you need to know.	Miskien is it it iennichste dat jo witte moatte.
We got nothing out of it.	Dêr krigen wy neat fan.
If we do this thing together.	As wy dit ding tegearre dogge.
The man is very tall!	De man is tige lang!
Water is very hard.	Wetter is tige hurd.
I could not be happier.	Ik koe net mear bliid wêze.
If she's here, fine.	As se hjir is, goed.
She was glad she now had someone to talk to.	Se wie bliid dat se no ien hie om mei te praten.
We are here to do some work.	Wy binne hjir om in wurk te dwaan.
If you have any questions, please ask.	Hawwe jo fragen, freegje asjebleaft.
It is done this way.	It wurdt dien op dizze manier.
He might have told more.	Hy hie miskien mear ferteld.
I would have too.	Ik soe ek ha.
You are my father.	Do bist myn heit.
To his room.	Nei syn keamer.
A few things happened this week.	Der binne dizze wike in pear dingen bard.
It would be easy.	Dit soe maklik wurde.
Can it happen?	Kin it barre?
Not that you'll ever see it.	Net dat jo it oait sjen sille.
They had not heard it either.	Se hiene it ek net heard.
It can be bad.	It kin min wêze.
It felt like time to do it.	It fielde tiid om it te dwaan.
He could not think anymore.	Hy koe net mear tinke.
I think we should get you well sooner, we do everything.	Ik tink dat wy jo earder goed krije moatte, wy dogge alles.
She does not look scared.	Se sjocht net bang.
I did not think otherwise.	Ik tocht der net oars oer.
But there's more to it than that.	Mar d'r is mear oan as dat.
What were we talking about?	Wêr hiene wy ​​it oer?
He said they should just give it more time.	Hy sei dat se it gewoan mear tiid moatte jaan.
Do you want a girl or a boy?	Wolle jo in famke of in jonge?
Think about this.	Tink troch dit.
No one knows who did it or why.	Nimmen wit wa't it dien hat of wêrom.
It happens, and it happens a lot.	It bart, en it bart in protte.
They happened after hours.	Se barde nei oeren.
You can do anything.	Jo kinne alles dwaan.
It's so beautiful.	It is sa moai.
Now for the other two.	No foar de oare twa.
He was angry.	Hy wie lilk.
We find something a lot.	Wy fine wat in protte.
We will need more of everything.	Wy sille mear fan alles nedich hawwe.
She was afraid of her children.	Se wie bang foar har bern.
And we get it home.	En wy krije it thús.
But he did run.	Mar hy rûn wol.
That makes two of us.	Dat makket twa fan ús.
He wanted to do whatever he wanted to do, but with her.	Hy woe alles dwaan wat er dwaan woe, mar mei har.
Maybe she just didn’t want to worry me anymore.	Miskien woe se my gewoan net mear soargen meitsje.
In a pretty big way.	Op in moai grutte manier.
He was waiting for you to come home.	Hy hat op jo wachte om thús te kommen.
But you would be wrong.	Mar jo soene ferkeard wêze.
He was a dog.	Hy wie in hûn.
He ate it all up.	Hy iet it allegear op.
There may be something.	Der kin wat wêze.
Just give me a reason to stay.	Jou my mar in reden om te bliuwen.
He would not find her here.	Hy soe har hjir net fine.
Decided to buy it.	Besletten om it te keapjen.
You might have to go now.	Jo moatte no miskien mar gean.
They are not in mine.	Se binne net yn myn.
This will help so much, Dad said.	Dit sil safolle helpe, sei heit.
I, I, I.	Ik, ik, ik.
He looked up at his friend.	Hy seach op nei syn freon.
Could be more.	Kin mear wêze.
It's very fun.	It is hiel leuk.
We can not let that happen.	Dat kinne wy ​​net barre litte.
Otherwise he would not.	Oars soe er net.
If only she hadn't done it.	As se it mar net die.
He thought it was different.	Hy tocht dat it oars wie.
I would do what she wanted.	Ik soe dwaan wat se woe.
But that has nothing to do with it.	Mar dêr hat it neat mei te krijen.
It does not do much work.	It docht net folle wurk.
They were surprised.	Se wiene ferrast.
She did not want to do the things she knew would help.	Se woe net dwaan de dingen se wist soe helpe.
I've done things.	Ik haw dingen dien.
He had had enough of it.	Hy hie der genôch fan.
The woman asked her father what she should do.	De frou frege har heit wat se dwaan moast.
He knew they had only one chance.	Hy wist dat se mar ien kâns hiene.
You thought wrong.	Jo tocht ferkeard.
He did what needed to be done.	Hy die wat dien wurde moast.
We have to work hard now.	Wy moatte no hurd wurkje.
But he would not have it.	Mar hy soe it net ha.
He told no one what he had seen.	Hy fertelde gjinien wat er sjoen hie.
But I doubt I can do this.	Mar ik twifelje dat ik dit kin.
He was himself again.	Hy wie wer himsels.
They did not talk about it, but everyone knew it.	Se prate der net fan, mar elkenien wist it.
As long as you are not interested.	Sa lang as jo net ynteressearre.
He said little.	Hy sei bytsje.
But this is obviously wrong.	Mar dit is fansels ferkeard.
It needs to be looked at.	Der moat nei sjoen wurde.
Her hand took his hand.	Har hân naam syn hân.
And this time he had kept it.	En dizze kear hie er it hâlden.
You do not have to say a word.	Jo hoege gjin wurd te sizzen.
Let them do what they want.	Lit se dwaan wat se wolle.
She could wait though.	Se koe wol wachtsje.
She was on to everything.	Se wie op alles.
But, let me know if you've heard it.	Mar, lit my witte as jo it heard hawwe.
Whatever it was.	Wat it ek wie.
Now that all seemed gone.	No like dat alles fuort.
But we do things differently.	Mar wy dogge dingen oars.
What is it for you ?.	Wat is it foar dy?.
I wish he was scared.	Ik woe dat er bang wie.
Really think about it.	Echt tinke oer it.
She has made great friends.	Se hat grutte freonen makke.
It keeps them going.	It hâldt se.
We would not get a chance here!	Wy soene hjir gjin kâns op krije!
Look out here.	Sjoch hjir út.
This is exactly what works for me.	Dit is krekt wat foar my wurket.
Good for her.	Goed foar har.
I do not know exactly why.	Ik wit net krekt wêrom.
I'm sure.	Ik bin der wis fan.
It could be one of those things.	It kin ien fan dy dingen wêze.
And it may not be the only one.	En it kin net de ienige wêze.
I hope to have been clear.	Ik hoopje dúdlik west te hawwen.
Please let me know if you have an idea.	Lit my asjebleaft witte as jo in idee hawwe.
It's so different there.	It is dêr sa oars.
They really do not want to leave.	Se wolle echt net fuort.
We love movies.	Wy hâlde fan film.
Just ask nicely.	Freegje mar moai.
We had nothing more to eat.	Wy hiene neat mear te iten.
He had work to do.	Hy hie wurk te dwaan.
He comes from a large family.	Hy komt út in grutte famylje.
I know you want something.	Ik wit dat jo wat wolle.
Not too old.	Net te âld.
But she did not give him the time.	Mar se joech him de tiid net.
And what a year it has become.	En wat is it in jier wurden.
This should have been her.	Dit hie har wêze moatten.
But so are many children.	Mar sa binne in protte bern.
One day, without any problems.	In dei, sûnder problemen.
I worked hard for my money.	Ik wurke hurd foar myn jild.
Hours can be long.	Oeren kinne lang wêze.
We love everyone.	Wy hâlde fan elkenien.
Not on what, mind.	Net op wat, tink.
Why had she come here.	Wêrom wie se hjir kommen.
You know he'll do it himself.	Jo witte dat hy it sels sil dwaan.
And no one did.	En gjinien die.
That will not happen here.	Dat sil hjir net barre.
What they really want to do is go home.	Wat se echt graach dwaan wolle is nei hûs.
Love talking to them.	Hâld se fan praten.
I think they want to do something.	Ik tink dat se wat dwaan wolle.
So of course it can no longer.	Sa kin it fansels net mear.
Work hard and you will find a job.	Wurkje hurd en jo sille in baan fine.
I knew how to get there now.	Ik wist der no te kommen.
With me, with your father, with this boy.	Mei my, mei dyn heit, mei dizze jonge.
We have become ill.	Wy binne siik wurden.
Lots of time.	In protte tiid.
Would not want that.	Soe dat net ha wolle.
Wei.	Wei.
We just talked.	Wy hawwe gewoan praat.
Not on the first day.	Net op de earste dei.
And so tell me.	En sa fertel my.
We talk it all out.	Wy prate alles út.
She said the good thing, always.	Se sei it goede ding, altyd.
I should never have come here.	Ik hie hjir nea komme moatten.
I can tell you that too.	Ik kin it dy ek wol sizze.
He opened the door for us.	Hy die de doar foar ús iepen.
That was really fun.	Dat wie echt leuk.
I would not be so good at it.	Ik soe der net sa goed yn wêze.
That's good for me.	Dat is goed foar my.
See how he is.	Sjoch hoe't hy is.
It's good to be tired.	It is goed om wurch te wêzen.
We will do better.	Wy sille it better dwaan.
He needs to do better work.	Hy moat better wurk dwaan.
Maybe it will come that way.	Miskien komt it wol sa.
He hoped it would not happen again.	Hy hope dat it net wer barre soe.
A friend of mine did.	In freon fan my die.
I'm fine now.	Ik bin no goed.
He knows it now.	Hy wit it no.
I really had no time this year.	Ik hie dit jier echt gjin tiid.
Both people talk for a long time.	Beide minsken prate lang.
That's more what we're talking about.	Dat is mear wêr't wy oer prate.
I've never seen one before.	Ik haw noch noait earder sjoen.
You can say more.	Jo kinne mear sizze.
He wished he could keep it that way.	Hy woe dat er it sa hâlde koe.
It's not that simple.	It is net sa gewoan.
Never saw the kids again.	Nea sjoen de bern wer.
Okay, but we do not have enough time.	Goed, mar wy hawwe net genôch tiid.
A father who is a father.	In heit dy't heit.
He did not say much.	Hy sei net folle.
The best we can.	It bêste dat wy kinne.
I could not.	Ik koe it net.
But tomorrow really never came.	Mar moarn kaam echt noait.
He was right there.	Hy wie krekt dêr.
I did not see him coming.	Ik seach him net kommen.
And here comes my question.	En hjir komt myn fraach.
The whole family was there.	De hiele famylje wie der.
I knew they would do well together.	Ik wist dat se it tegearre goed dwaan soene.
I do both.	Ik doch beide.
I'm just interested in what it is.	Ik bin gewoan ynteressearre yn wat it.
That seemed likely.	Dat like wierskynlik.
He felt tired.	Hy fielde him wurch.
They have to go with us.	Se moatte mei ús gean.
Or if there's someone in it.	Of as der immen yn sit.
People just get busy.	Minsken krije gewoan drok.
I wanted to leave.	Ik woe fuort.
I can no longer ask for it.	Ik kin der net mear fan freegje.
It was only one hour.	It wie mar ien oere.
Get in some trouble.	Kom yn wat problemen.
We need you now more than ever.	Wy hawwe dy no mear as ea nedich.
We just buy time.	Wy keapje gewoan tiid.
You could do that one day.	Dat koene jo ien dei dwaan.
I still have so many friends there.	Ik haw dêr noch safolle freonen.
Everyone should see this.	Elkenien moat dit sjen.
But he has no regrets.	Mar hy hat gjin spyt.
I thought he was just too late.	Ik tocht dat hy gewoan te let wie.
She was so beautiful.	Se wie sa moai.
We have done a good job of keeping them.	Wy hawwe in goed wurk dien om se te hâlden.
Back home, back home.	Wer thús, wer thús.
She was not sure why she had come here last night.	Se wie net wis wêrom't se hjir fannacht kommen wie.
It does not matter much to whom.	It makket se net folle út mei wa.
I'm just trying to keep up.	Ik besykje gewoan by te hâlden.
I thought about it a lot.	Ik tocht dêr in protte oer.
He did not know what more he could do.	Hy wist net wat er mear dwaan koe.
Maybe she would then.	Miskien soe se dan wol.
They eat everything.	Se ite alles.
Not much happens there.	Dêr bart net folle.
Think before you act.	Tink foardat jo dogge.
They did not tell me anything.	Se hawwe my neat ferteld.
Both great friends.	Beide grutte freonen.
Anyway is fine with me.	Hoe dan ek is goed mei my.
It was hard to see anything clear.	It wie dreech om wat dúdlik te sjen.
You've been hurt.	Do hast sear wurden.
But it's what we have.	Mar it is wat wy hawwe.
They want it to be difficult.	Se wolle dat it dreech wurdt.
If she did not want to do something, she did not do it.	As se wat net dwaan woe, dan die se it net.
I think it's true.	Ik tink dat it wier is.
He never intended to.	Hy wie noait fan plan.
I have heard of a few people who do that.	Ik haw heard fan in pear minsken dy't dat dogge.
But maybe that was not true.	Mar miskien wie dat net wier.
Nobody knew what happened.	Nimmen wist wat der barde.
Come on man, just go away.	Kom op man, gean mar fuort.
We have not even seen it.	Wy hawwe it net iens sjoen.
I said no more.	Ik sei net mear.
No idea of ​​the plan.	Gjin idee fan it plan.
But you knew that.	Mar jo wisten dat.
Still trying to figure out what happened.	Noch altyd besykje út te finen wat der bard is.
Hope you know what you are doing.	Hoopje dat jo witte wat jo dogge.
Maybe both were true.	Miskien wiene beide wier.
How long ago did it seem.	Hoe lang lyn liket it.
I can already tell.	Ik kin it al fertelle.
Or your family.	Of jo famylje.
It's up to you.	It is oan dy.
They have never seen me.	My hawwe se nea sjoen.
It was given to me.	It wie my jûn.
No one to talk to.	Gjinien om mei te praten.
Are you talking about him?	Hawwe jo it oer him?
Who is that man?	Wa is dy man?
It's one of my favorite foods.	It is ien fan myn favorite iten.
I did not really want the truth.	Ik woe net echt de wierheid.
We're ready to go.	Wy binne klear om te gean.
But not often.	Mar net faak.
For what good that will do too.	Foar wat goed dat ek dwaan sil.
We do not know more.	Mear witte wy net.
I just can not find.	Ik kin gewoan net fine.
You obviously want something from me.	Jo wolle fansels wat fan my.
I do not know if this will be a problem.	Ik wit net oft dit in probleem sil wurde.
But it was not the only one.	Mar it wie net de ienige.
Just back to where she started.	Krekt werom wêr't se begûn.
Just a child.	Krekt in bern.
But this is my job.	Mar dit is myn wurk.
There was enough money given.	Der wie genôch jild jûn.
She had to tell her.	Se moast it har fertelle.
In that house they would have found hair.	Yn dat hûs soene se hier fûn hawwe.
I'm so sick of it.	Ik bin der sa siik fan.
There was no reason left in her.	Der wie gjin reden mear yn har.
He looks up at us.	Hy sjocht nei ús op.
That becomes a lot of work.	Dat wurdt in protte wurk.
I knew pretty well.	Ik wist aardich.
It was probably more than that.	It wie wol mear as dat.
It was a good place.	It wie in goed plak.
Think about how you want to eat.	Tink oer hoe't jo ite wolle.
.	.
But she's in town.	Mar se is yn 'e stêd.
It was true.	It wie wier.
That was the plan.	Dat waard it plan.
They are pretty clear.	Se binne frij dúdlik.
You said this was not enough for you.	Jo seine dat dit net genôch foar jo wie.
Well, none of that anymore.	No, neat fan dat mear.
He will pay nothing for it.	Hy sil der neat fan betelje.
And since then, there have been no more problems.	En sûnt dy tiid hat der gjin problemen mear west.
Both of those things really can not be true.	Beide fan dy dingen kinne echt net wier wêze.
Her house was open to family and friends.	Har hûs wie iepen foar famylje en freonen.
Same from when he was sitting with the police.	Deselde fan doe't er by de plysje siet.
That did not concern me.	Dat gie my net oan.
That did not happen here.	Dat is hjir net bard.
Take them with you.	Nim se mei dy.
His hair was really long.	Syn hier wie echt lang.
This day can find him nothing here.	Dizze dei kin him hjir neat fine.
We need to talk about it.	Wy moatte der oer prate.
But it does more than that.	Mar it docht mear as dat.
We'll make her tell us where she is.	Wy sille meitsje se fertelle ús wêr't se is.
The kids did it.	De bern diene it.
I did not think clearly.	Ik tocht net dúdlik.
But there could be a way.	Mar dêr soe der in wei wêze kinne.
I can not let him.	Ik kin him net litte.
I saw her friend there.	Ik seach har freon dêr.
Other people had the same idea as us.	Oare minsken hiene itselde idee as wy.
That's for you to find out.	Dat is foar jo om út te finen.
He also did not seem to be well.	Hy like ek net goed te wêzen.
I can not get enough of it.	Ik kin der net genôch fan krije.
She was no longer the same.	Se wie net mear deselde.
Well, you get the idea.	No, jo krije it idee.
I'm surprised at how tall he is!	Ik bin ferrast oer hoe lang hy is!
This has been too much for you.	Dit hat jo te folle west.
We are not talking about it.	Wy prate der net oer.
Many things still need to be done.	Der moatte noch in protte dingen dien wurde.
I can not say for sure.	Ik kin net wis sizze.
Leave that to me.	Lit dat mar oan my oer.
He liked.	Hy like.
She is never wrong.	Se is nea ferkeard.
But here he was.	Mar hjir wie er.
You will probably get a seat.	Jo sille wierskynlik in sit krije.
But we do not have that.	Mar dat hawwe wy net.
I do not even know.	Ik wit it sels net.
They should come to me.	Se soene my komme moatte.
Go on, get on.	Gean troch, krije.
She never said a word to him.	Se sei noait in wurd tsjin him.
It's the people.	It is de minsken.
No one was interested in what we were doing.	Nimmen wie ynteressearre yn wat wy diene.
What can i do.	Wat kin ik dwaan.
He did not get the problem with this idea.	Hy krige it probleem net mei dit idee.
A woman is with me.	In frou is by my.
The money is all gone.	It jild is allegear fuort.
I ask for money for food.	Ik freegje om jild foar iten.
He wanted it bad.	Hy woe it min.
I can live with it better.	Ik kin der better oan wenne.
Someone knows all about us.	Immen wit alles oer ús.
That's what he was talking about.	Dêr hie er it oer.
What time is it? 	Hoe let is it?
I'm sick of this.	Ik bin hjir siik fan.
.	.
It's something to keep in mind.	It is wat om yn gedachten te hâlden.
I was also surprised.	Ik wie ek ferrast.
No one really knows for sure.	Nimmen wit it echt wis.
It was a house.	It wie in hûs.
That’s what my kids say.	Dat sizze myn bern.
Unlike my wife.	Oars as myn frou.
I'll help you find them.	Ik sil jo helpe se te finen.
But there was one problem with this idea.	Mar d'r wie ien probleem mei dit idee.
But you can do this for me.	Mar jo kinne dit foar my dwaan.
And they are good.	En se binne goed.
He said it would not happen.	Hy sei dat it net barre soe.
Would be ready for it.	Soe der klear foar wêze.
Maybe he could too.	Miskien koe er ek.
The other was the same.	De oare wie itselde.
I left my door open.	Ik liet myn doar iepen.
He cares.	Hy docht der om.
There was something he did not tell her.	Der wie wat dat er har net fertelde.
I try to read things.	Ik besykje dingen te lêzen.
We do have a little time though.	Wy hawwe wol in bytsje tiid.
My child is happy.	Myn bern is bliid.
You have a good father and a mother.	Jo hawwe in goede heit en in mem.
It seems like a good place to be.	It liket in goed plak om te wêzen.
And you may know why.	En jo kinne miskien witte wêrom.
We both knew what he was going to do with it.	Wy wisten beide wat er der mei dwaan soe.
I take them in.	Ik nim har yn.
I can not help but worry.	Ik kin net oars as soargen.
If we agree, we agree.	As wy it iens binne, binne wy ​​it iens.
She does not want him now, not so.	Se wol him no net, net sa.
Comes twice a year.	Komt twa kear yn it jier.
He waited to be asked why.	Hy wachte om frege te wurden wêrom.
Even if no one else was.	Ek al wie nimmen oars.
You know you are.	Jo witte dat jo.
Just a little.	Mar in bytsje.
He knew it was not a picture.	Hy wist dat it gjin foto wie.
I'm not really sure.	Ik bin der eins net wis fan.
I thought, go for it.	Ik tocht, gean der foar.
What is your favorite word?	Wat is dyn favorite wurd?
Which of course says the.	Wat se fansels die.
It does happen.	It bart wol.
I have no idea why.	Ik haw gjin idee wêrom.
You can not do everything yourself.	Jo kinne net alles sels dwaan.
From him who has not.	Fan him dy't net hat.
I will stop there.	Ik sil dêr ophâlde.
Not that he wanted to be.	Net dat er wêze woe.
He was very good.	Hy wie tige goed.
I'm having a hard time.	Ik ha it dreech.
He hoped she was well.	Hy hope dat se goed wie.
I will take care of this.	Ik sil soargje foar dit.
That's the best we can do.	Dat is it bêste dat wy kinne dwaan.
I would ask you, however.	Ik soe dy freegje, mar.
He needs some time.	Hy hat wat tiid nedich.
His father took a seat.	Syn heit naam in sit.
He's not the man he used to be.	Hy is net de man dy't er wie.
He carefully took his time.	Hy naam foarsichtich syn tiid.
I really did, she thought.	Ik haw it echt dien, tocht se.
That would have pleased him.	Dat fûn him wol aardich.
She was better to me than a mother.	Se wie foar my better as in mem.
This is what she wanted.	Dit is wat se woe.
I'll get him.	Ik sil him krije.
They never made it.	Se hawwe it noait makke.
I do not know who they were.	Ik wit net wa't se wiene.
A friend of the couple came to help her.	In freon fan it pear kaam har te helpen.
Who it is we think we should be.	Wa't it is tinke wy dat wy moatte wêze.
No need to worry.	Hoecht gjin soargen te meitsjen.
They are quite old.	Se binne frij âld.
I will put it this way.	Ik sil it sa sizze.
It was my idea.	It wie myn idee.
I can get us there.	Ik kin ús dêr krije.
He's such a man.	Hy is sa'n man.
They want to visit the city.	Se wolle de stêd besykje.
In truth, he probably should have a few.	Yn wierheid, hy moat wierskynlik in pear hawwe.
So let me ask you this.	Dat lit my dy dit freegje.
Of a kind.	Fan in soarte.
Film.	Film.
They love us.	Se hâlde fan ús.
After all, life.	Nei alle gedachten libben.
I think you know.	Ik tink dat jo witte.
She went back home tired.	Se gie wurch werom nei hûs.
Tom left a door open.	Tom liet in doar iepen.
I tried so hard.	Ik besocht sa hurd.
I can not believe he's doing this.	Ik kin it net leauwe dat hy dit docht.
It was a real book, through and through.	It wie in echt boek, troch en troch.
She did not know it, but she felt she would.	Se wist it net, mar se fielde dat se it soe.
He came to her well enough.	Hy kaam wol genôch by har.
And that could tell you in the room.	En dat koene jo yn 'e keamer fertelle.
I know that little.	Ik wit dat bytsje.
I can not let you.	Ik kin dy net litte litte.
She comes to us.	Se komt nei ús ta.
Let us do our job.	Lit ús ús wurk dwaan.
Now she was really in trouble.	No wie se echt yn de problemen.
Has nothing to do with this.	Hat neat mei dizze.
I think we can.	Ik tink dat wy kinne.
I was very surprised.	Ik wie tige ferrast.
But one thing.	Mar ien ding.
It made me angry.	Dit makke my lilk.
Nothing is so difficult.	Neat is sa dreech.
If anyone could, it would be him.	As immen koe, soe it him wêze.
It was all very different from everything she knew.	It wie allegear hiel oars as alles wat se wist.
I'll look after him.	Ik sil nei him sjen.
I had told him to stop being careful.	Ik hie him sein om op te hâlden mei foarsichtich te wêzen.
You say where something is in time by giving, now, the time.	Jo sizze wêr't wat yn 'e tiid is troch te jaan, no, de tiid.
But we must not stop there.	Mar dêr moatte wy net ophâlde.
They can be the same or they can be different.	Se kinne itselde wêze of se kinne oars wêze.
I do not like him here.	Ik hâld fan him hjir net.
But she kept trying.	Mar se bleau besykje.
The movie started.	De film begûn.
It's very ordinary.	It is hiel gewoan.
A woman, not a man.	In frou, gjin man.
I'm sure it's happening.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it bart.
But that does not matter much.	Mar dat makket net folle út.
She was not sure she wanted that.	Se wie der net wis fan dat se dat woe.
She had no idea what was going on.	Se hie gjin idee wat der oan de hân wie.
He can do anything with her and with her.	Hy kin alles mei har en mei har dwaan.
You make them happen.	Jo meitsje se barre.
She must be able to.	Se moat kinne.
He looked up at me.	Hy seach op nei my.
I asked her.	Ik frege har om.
To see him, this first time.	Om him te sjen, dizze earste kear.
And then he comes back.	En dan komt er werom.
You will not return.	Jo sille net werom.
He asked where she came from.	Hy frege wêr't se wei kaam.
He was sick of doing it.	Hy wie siik fan it dwaan.
He got out of there.	Hy kaam der út.
You're probably really busy.	Jo binne wierskynlik echt drok.
Go and do that.	Gean en doch dat.
Never heard of the place.	Nea heard fan it plak.
Both needed them more.	Beide hiene se mear nedich.
Everyone came, on time.	Elkenien kaam, op tiid.
Everything here to help us on our way.	Alles hjir om ús op ús wei te helpen.
I found it even better than the first.	Ik fûn it noch better as de earste.
If you are interested, please let us know.	As jo ​​​​ynteressearre binne, lit it ús dan gewoan witte.
I work on my day job.	Ik wurkje op myn dei wurk.
This time they did not.	Dizze kear diene se net.
Come home with me.	Kom mei my thús.
I would like some water, please.	Ik wol graach wat wetter, asjebleaft.
We have every reason to fear that this past will return.	Wy hawwe alle reden om bang te wêzen dat dit ferline werom wol.
He has no time for this.	Hy hat hjir gjin tiid foar.
What time do you get the work done?	Hoe let meitsje jo it wurk klear?
Be really careful.	Wês echt foarsichtich.
So we'll see.	Sa sille wy sjen.
I've been watching to see how she does it.	Ik haw sjoen om te sjen hoe't se it docht.
If anyone can help, do.	As immen kin helpe, dwaan.
On both days.	Op beide dagen.
One bit at a time.	Ien bytsje op in tiid.
It's not what it's about.	It is net wêr't it oer giet.
He did not say why.	Hy sei net wêrom.
Can you help me to help him ?.	Kinne jo my helpe om him te helpen?.
If not, let me know.	Sa net, lit it my witte.
We never found them.	Wy hawwe se noait fûn.
Whatever it is, it knows everything we do.	Wat it ek is, it wit alles wat wy dogge.
He had surprised her.	Hy hie har ferrast.
They love each other.	Se hâlde fan elkoar.
Now you can get everything.	No kinne jo alles krije.
I felt really good.	Ik fielde my echt goed.
It's not the same.	It is net itselde.
She does not want me.	Se wol my net.
It can be found here.	It is hjir te finen.
I really hope so.	Dat hoopje ik echt.
I'm going home today.	Ik gean hjoed nei hûs.
That would not let her happen.	Dat soe se net barre litte.
Please do it for me.	Doch it asjebleaft foar my.
It seemed good.	It like goed.
No one was ready to talk.	Nimmen wie ree om te praten.
I'll show you.	Ik sil it dy sjen litte.
We talk about life.	Wy prate oer it libben.
I did not go to see him.	Ik gie him net sjen.
Anyway, it works now.	Hoe dan ek, it wurket no.
He was too scared to talk.	Hy wie te bang om te praten.
I'm still mad at you !!	Ik bin noch altyd lilk op dy!!
He's just beautiful.	Hy is gewoan moai.
But they will be out there.	Mar se sille der út wêze.
They are interested in a few questions.	Se binne ynteressearre yn in pear fragen.
I love that boy.	Ik hâld fan dy jonge.
This will never do.	Dit sil nea dwaan.
Family should take care of family.	Famylje moat soargje foar famylje.
There were so many things that could be done better.	Der wiene safolle dingen dy't better koe wurde dien.
I had no idea it would be so beautiful.	Ik hie gjin idee dat it sa moai wêze soe.
I know right away what he is saying.	Ik wit fuort wat er seit.
Which made my dad happy.	Wat makke myn heit bliid.
One day you will regret it, they say.	Op in dei sille jo it spyt hawwe, sizze se.
She was tired but happy with where she was.	Se wie wurch, mar bliid mei wêr't se wie.
They want to know what to do.	Se wolle witte wat se dwaan moatte.
I just want to say this.	Ik wol dit mar sizze.
None of us can afford it to happen.	Net ien fan ús kin it betelje dat dat bart.
But in a new way.	Mar op in nije manier.
I do not know what she's talking about.	Ik wit net wêr't se it oer hat.
It will be the same.	It sil itselde wêze.
It's what he is.	It is wat hy is.
No help there.	Gjin help dêr.
We need to have it.	Wy moatte it hawwe.
I'm so tired.	Ik bin sa wurch.
I quickly walked away to my house.	Ik rûn gau fuort nei myn hûs.
I'm better now.	Ik bin no better.
That was what she had said.	Dat hie se sein.
I'm not sure what's best.	Ik bin der net wis fan wat de bêste is.
I'm still alive and well.	Ik bin noch yn libben en goed.
It used to happen once a year or so.	It barde eartiids ien kear yn it jier of sa.
Well, same thing again.	No, itselde ding wer.
That other being you.	Dat oare wêzen do.
He didn't even have to say much.	Hy hoegde sa net iens folle te sizzen.
I really want to be.	Ik wol echt wêze.
I have not heard back yet.	Ik haw noch net werom heard.
The water was out there.	It wetter siet der út.
I can not either.	Ik kin ek net.
She's not good at anything.	Se is oan gjin goed.
There's no reason not to have it.	D'r is gjin reden om it net te hawwen.
But it was not her.	Mar it wie har net.
This is a very bad time.	Dit is in tige minne tiid.
I should agree with you there.	Ik soe it dêr mei dy iens wêze moatte.
Good with me.	Goed mei my.
You were planning to see him.	Jo wiene fan plan om him te sjen.
And go.	En gean.
He did not know how and when.	Hy wist net hoe en wannear.
You have to be who you are.	Jo moatte wêze wa't jo binne.
So much has happened in the year.	Yn it jier is der safolle bard.
And it was very different in those days than it is now.	En it wie yn dy dagen hiel oars as no.
Not all water is necessary for life.	Net alle wetter is nedich foar it libben.
He was obviously ready for it.	Hy wie der fansels klear foar.
I want you to believe that.	Ik wol dat jo dat leauwe.
You said before.	Jo seine earder.
I can talk.	Ik kin prate.
She is as beautiful as ever.	Se is sa moai as altyd.
He had been wrong.	Hy hie ferkeard west.
If there are, well.	As der binne, goed.
She had a plan, and she would stick to it.	Se hie in plan, en se soe har der oan hâlde.
This year it will be different.	Dit jier wurdt it oars.
It's here, actually.	It is hjir, eins.
We should not either.	Wy moatte ek net.
He is a thing of the past.	Hy is in ding fan it ferline.
I think a lot of people don’t get the book.	Ik tink dat in protte minsken it boek net krije.
You can see how happy this has made him.	Jo kinne sjen hoe bliid dit hat makke him.
Let's watch a movie this evening.	Litte wy dizze jûn in film sjen.
She has been wrong.	Se hat ferkeard west.
Everything that stands in the way is bad.	Alles wat yn 'e wei stiet is min.
Both are very good.	Beide binne hiel goed.
I do not think they will.	Ik tink net dat se sille.
No one could do it better.	Nimmen koe it better.
He took his hand.	Hy naam syn hân.
She is not looking forward to much more work.	Se sjocht der net út foar folle mear wurk.
He had not seen her for more than two years.	Hy hie har net mear as twa jier sjoen.
He wants to do the right thing, they say.	Hy wol it goede dwaan, sizze se.
Once a year, that is.	Ien kear yn it jier, dat wol.
There was not much time.	Der wie net folle tiid.
Or just not necessary, or both.	Of gewoan net nedich, of beide.
It's been a week here.	It hat hjir in wike west.
It's not good to talk.	It is net goed om te praten.
Then you will know it.	Dan sille jo it witte.
She had no idea what to say.	Se hie gjin idee wat te sizzen.
No one has ever decided for sure.	Nimmen hat oait besletten foar wis.
What works today may not work tomorrow.	Wat hjoed wurket, wurket miskien net moarn.
They were wrong.	Se wiene ferkeard.
It does not come out after all.	It komt nei alle gedachten net út.
They are easy to get.	Se binne maklik te krijen.
But we could not.	Mar wy koene it net.
It had seen better days.	It hie bettere dagen sjoen.
He really had nothing to do with it.	Hy hie der eins neat om.
That will not be nice.	Dat sil net moai wêze.
He was never without a car.	Hy wie nea sûnder in auto.
They would have the party.	Se soene it feest ha.
You're not his friend.	Do bist syn freon net.
He stands for you.	Hy stiet foar dy.
Someone else said he was.	Immen oars sei dat hy wie.
This was not exactly the plan.	Dit wie net krekt it plan.
I had only been here a few days.	Ik hie hjir mar in pear dagen west.
Everything and everyone.	Alles en elkenien.
I do not feel it often.	Ik fiel it net faak.
I could have anything.	Ik koe alles hawwe.
She felt tired.	Se fielde har wurch.
I'm waiting for you.	Ik wachtsje foar jo op.
There is no hope for us.	Der is gjin hope foar ús.
They are easy to make.	Se binne maklik te meitsjen.
That strikes me as obvious.	Dat docht my fansels.
They are good too.	Se binne ek goed.
Somehow that had never happened before.	Op ien of oare manier wie dat noch noait earder bard.
You can not and will not win.	Jo kinne net en sille net winne.
The idea was his.	It idee wie syn.
Even more people will leave.	Noch mear minsken sille fuort.
I can never stay.	Ik kin nea bliuwe.
She was late for work.	Se wie te let op it wurk.
But anyway.	Mar hoe dan ek.
We did not hurt anyone.	Wy hawwe gjinien sear dien.
She is even happy.	Se is sels bliid.
She was not done.	Se wie net dien.
Please help me.	Help my asjebleaft.
And that's maybe a good thing.	En dat is miskien in goed ding.
Let me know.	Lit it my witte.
Hold our place.	Hâld ús plak.
And he is not the only one.	En hy is net de ienige.
That would not do.	Dat soe net dwaan.
Same here.	Itselde hjir.
I have no problem with it.	Ik haw gjin problemen mei it.
You should have taken me.	Do hiest my nimme moatten.
This time it's here for the kids too.	Dizze kear is it hjir ek foar de bern.
Well, come on.	No, kom op.
But how could he be too late?	Mar hoe koe er te let wêze?
Nothing they did seemed to help.	Neat se diene like te helpen.
For one thing, they were probably a few years old.	Foar ien ding wiene se wierskynlik in pear jier âld.
What time of year was this?	Hokker tiid fan it jier wie dit?
She can no longer do with one thing.	Se kin net mear mei ien ding.
Now things were different.	No wiene dingen oars.
I assume it was you.	Ik nim oan dat it jo wiene.
Found them out.	Fûn se út.
This is Dad's room.	Dit is de heit syn keamer.
I know you want to be with me.	Ik wit dat jo mei my wolle.
There are always.	Der binne altyd.
This is the thing.	Dit is it ding.
Everyone ran.	Elkenien rûn.
She could not.	Dat koe se net.
He was an ordinary man, he thought to himself.	It wie in gewoan man, tocht er by himsels.
No one will ever know.	Nimmen sil ea witte.
Be a better person.	Wês in better persoan.
Those things have nothing to do with anything.	Dy dingen hawwe neat te krijen mei neat.
It would be like back when things were not bad.	It soe wêze as werom doe't dingen wiene net min.
This is your house.	Dit is dyn hûs.
She also started talking to me.	Se begûn ek mei my te praten.
But this was real.	Mar dit wie echt.
What do you think will happen?	Wat tinksto sil barre?
He wanted to stay.	Hy woe bliuwe.
You've never said such a thing before.	Jo hawwe noch noait sa'n ding sein.
She did not want to go there.	Dêr woe se net hinne.
I tried really hard to find it.	Ik besocht echt hurd om it te finen.
And neither was my mother.	En it wie myn mem ek net.
Got me in trouble	Hat my yn de problemen
He went on as before.	Hy gie troch as earder.
And water too.	En wetter ek.
So, so true.	Sa, sa wier.
They are not good.	Se binne net goed.
It's just hard to figure out.	It is gewoan dreech om út te finen.
That's your problem, not mine.	Dat is dyn probleem, en net myn.
We were still to be seen.	Wy wiene noch te sjen.
This is what our family has become.	Dit is wat ús famylje wurden is.
We have to go now.	Wy moatte no fuort.
You do not even know what it's like for me.	Jo witte net iens hoe't it foar my is.
But she could no longer see him.	Mar se koe him net mear sjen.
Well, there you have it.	No, dêr hast it.
I think you have something on hand.	Ik tink wol dat jo wat oan 'e hân binne.
That was not.	Dat wie net.
Both, she thought.	Beide, tocht se.
You did the right thing	Jo hawwe it goede dien
I love that movie.	Ik hâld fan dy film.
Seems easy enough !.	Liket maklik genôch!.
I need to get a job.	Ik moat in baan krije.
You do not think clearly.	Jo tinke net dúdlik.
Everything we did not get.	Alles wat wy net krigen hawwe.
I asked him how much money he wanted.	Ik frege him hoefolle jild hy woe.
There is a good chance you can get your money back.	D'r is in goede kâns dat jo jo jild werom kinne krije.
She knows that all too well.	Dat wit se mar al te goed.
Maybe he.	Miskien hy.
She was probably in bed.	Se wie wierskynlik op bêd.
If they get in the way, back.	As se yn 'e wei komme, werom.
A family favorite.	In famylje favorite.
I would put money on it.	Ik soe der jild op sette.
All the other kids were in there like that.	Alle oare bern wiene der sa yn.
You play a class.	Jo spylje in klasse.
It was just not done.	It wie gewoan net dien.
You always worry about things you should not have.	Jo hawwe altyd soargen oer dingen dy't jo net moatte hawwe.
Place in the city.	Plak yn 'e stêd.
You could never tell.	Jo koene it noait fertelle.
He says they will be children again.	Hy seit dat se wer bern wurde.
My father waited.	Myn heit wachte.
That is not true here.	Dat is hjir net wier.
Until then, there is work to be done.	Oant dan is der wurk te dwaan.
When the latter is over, you do that.	As it lêste is, dogge jo dat.
But he gave it all up.	Mar hy joech it allegear op.
Give us just one more.	Jou ús mar ien mear.
Once upon a time, this was my favorite movie.	Eartiids wie dit myn favorite film.
A bad movie is not fun.	In minne film is net leuk.
And if you do.	En as jo dogge.
Love that boy.	Hâld fan dy jonge.
He left them.	Hy liet se.
It doesn't matter.	Docht er net ta.
That was my chance.	Dat wie myn kâns.
I probably will.	Ik sil wierskynlik.
We would go home.	Wy soene nei hûs.
Or what's the.	Of wat se die.
These people say they want work.	Dizze minsken sizze dat se wurk wolle.
Out of.	Út de.
He is ready to do it.	Hy is ree om it te dwaan.
I do a lot of work.	Ik doch in protte wurk.
We just knew something was wrong.	Wy wisten gewoan dat der wat net goed wie.
However, she could not speak, never did.	Hoe dan ek, se koe net prate, nea dien.
But that's not really the truth.	Mar dat is net echt de wierheid.
When that happens, it happens.	As dat bart, bart it.
If it happened.	As it barde.
I've never heard that song before.	Dat liet haw ik noch nea earder heard.
He used to work all year round.	Hy wurke eartiids it hiele jier troch.
It works well.	It wurket goed.
Well, then.	No, dan.
That it is somehow wrong.	Dat it op ien of oare manier ferkeard is.
He may not have time to talk.	Hy hat miskien gjin tiid om te praten.
Time to get ready.	Tiid om klear te meitsjen.
You made him and me very happy.	Jo hawwe him en my tige bliid makke.
I was sure this was a bad idea.	Ik wie der wis fan dat dit in min idee wie.
Walked away from home three times.	Rûn trije kear fan hûs ôf.
I'm not scared.	Ik bin net bang.
They just go home.	Se geane gewoan nei hûs.
This is no longer necessary.	Dit is no net mear nedich.
But there was no way he could return.	Mar der wie gjin manier hy koe werom.
Don't worry.	Meitsje dy gjin soargen.
If they had money, there was no problem.	As se jild hiene, wie der gjin probleem.
Not good or bad, just.	Net goed of min, gewoan is.
I want to work with you.	Ik wol mei dy wurkje.
But, we are not without hope.	Mar, wy binne net sûnder hope.
This is of course true.	Dit is fansels wier.
So this can not really be realized.	Sa kin dit net echt realisearre wurde.
Someone asked if we should do something about it.	Immen frege oft wy der wat oan dwaan moatte.
I need you now.	Ik haw dy no nedich.
That I should not have said.	Dat hie ik net sizze moatten.
You're going to make one.	Jo geane ien meitsje.
I'm sure my mom will like it too.	Ik bin der wis fan dat myn mem it ek leuk sil.
To be a mother is to see.	Om mem te wêzen is om te sjen.
You have nothing.	Do hast neat.
But that's not how it started.	Mar sa begûn it net.
Talking was my idea.	It praat wie myn idee.
It came out well.	It kaam goed út.
But that is never enough.	Mar dat is nea genôch.
He acts as if unconvinced.	Hy docht as net oertsjûge.
I want you to know something.	Ik wol dat jo wat witte.
We'll be back soon.	Wy komme gau wer op.
I never got one.	Ik krige noch noait.
They were not happy with us.	Se wiene net bliid mei ús.
It's not just for return.	It is net allinnich foar werom.
And it was something else.	En it wie wat oars.
We have to wait.	Wy moatte wachtsje.
Dad will try to get here.	Heit sil besykje hjir te kommen.
but that can not be entirely.	mar dat kin net hielendal.
I still want to.	Ik wol noch wol.
Everyone gets tired of you.	Elkenien wurdt wurch fan dy.
Not one else.	Net ien oars.
I think people will see that.	Ik tink dat minsken dat sille sjen.
If he wanted to do this, it would be so.	As hy dit dwaan woe, dan soe it sa wêze.
I just thought you should know.	Ik tocht gewoan dat jo it witte moatte.
We need to talk things over.	Wy moatte dingen oer prate.
But nothing found.	Mar neat fûn.
Why, there were two other people in the room.	Wêrom, der wiene twa oare minsken yn 'e keamer.
That happened.	Dat is bard.
She knew he knew it.	Se wist dat er it wist.
All who have heard.	Allegear dy't heard hawwe.
I would need a lot.	Ik soe in protte nedich hawwe.
They needed the food.	Se hiene it iten nedich.
They just seem to be.	Se lykje gewoan te wêzen.
You can do nothing to us.	Jo kinne ús neat dwaan.
And that hurts.	En dat die sear.
You will not take me back.	Jo nimme my net werom.
Nothing ever worked.	Neat wurke oait.
He could not know it.	Hy koe it net witte.
I thought you were the only ones.	Ik tocht dat jo de iennichste wiene.
This is the way.	Dit is de wei.
Which one.	Hokker.
If you can not, that's fine too.	As jo ​​​​net kinne, is dat ek goed.
You know what you have.	Jo witte wat jo hawwe.
Children will be children.	Bern sille bern wêze.
This was her best year yet.	Dit wie har bêste jier noch.
We need the seat.	Wy hawwe de sit nedich.
I went wrong.	Ik bin ferkeard gien.
He put it into his words.	Hy sette it yn syn wurden.
The boy saw nothing.	De jonge seach neat.
Just so it was done.	Krekt sa wie it dien.
You never know !.	Jo witte mar noait!.
Tomorrow we go home.	Moarn geane wy ​​nei hûs.
Other than that, many play, for sure.	Oars as dat, spylje in protte, foar wis.
There is nothing too scary.	Der is neat te bang.
I know you can do this.	Ik wit dat jo dit kinne.
When she came into his life, everything could be different.	As se yn syn libben kaam, koe alles oars.
I do not even know how you would do that.	Ik wit net iens hoe't jo dat dwaan soene.
But almost everyone is very sure.	Mar hast elkenien is hiel wis.
Or more than that.	Of mear as dat.
Of course you do not have it.	Fansels hawwe jo it net.
Now.	No.
In fact, she seemed to really like him.	Eins like se him echt leuk te hawwen.
Talking is not easy for me.	Prate komt my net maklik.
I was gone.	Ik wie fuort.
No reason to stop.	Gjin reden om op te hâlden.
I thought the same.	Ik tocht itselde.
I do not want you to try to figure things out.	Ik wol net dat jo besykje dingen út te finen.
Let's see what it is.	Litte wy sjen wat it is.
I did not even want to come here.	Ik woe hjir net iens komme.
My whole family did.	Myn hiele famylje die.
He was hard.	Hy wie hurd.
Almost a month earlier.	Hast in moanne earder.
I think you will be surprised by how much.	Ik tink dat jo ferrast wurde troch hoefolle.
This was not who he was supposed to be.	Dit wie net wa't er wêze moast.
See, it does not matter.	Sjoch, it makket neat út.
Do not take them.	Nim se net.
You have to eat.	Jo moatte ite.
It was gone now.	It wie no fuort.
He made me.	Hy makke my.
People have to pay.	Minsken moatte betelje.
They are waiting for him.	Se wachtsje op him.
You know what needs to be done.	Jo witte wat der dien wurde moat.
I have them all working.	Ik haw se allegear wurkje.
I know so much about you.	Ik wit safolle oer dy.
I need them for nothing.	Ik haw se foar neat nedich.
They needed her.	Se hiene har nedich.
We just could not believe it.	Wy koene it gewoan net leauwe.
I wondered what the meeting could be about.	Ik frege my ôf wêr't de gearkomste oer gean koe.
Unlike my parents.	Oars as myn âlden.
But very glad they are back.	Mar tige bliid dat se werom binne.
I even had a dog.	Ik hie sels in hûn.
Year after year after year.	Jier nei jier nei jier.
I did not know you were.	Ik wist net dat jo wiene.
Come out with me a little.	Kom in bytsje mei my út.
It looks like a beautiful child.	It liket in moai bern.
And look how well that came.	En sjoch hoe goed dat kaam.
This is about me now.	Dit giet no oer my.
But she did not want anything else.	Mar se woe net oars.
It no longer stands.	It stiet net mear.
And there it is a little better.	En dêr is it in bytsje better.
It became a thing.	It waard in ding.
Then they go back to work.	Dan geane se wer oan it wurk.
Just back home.	Gewoan werom nei hûs.
I have always been so careful.	Ik ha altyd sa foarsichtich west.
You just can not see them.	Jo kinne se gewoan net sjen.
Too early to read.	Te betiid om te lêzen.
Work and become one.	Wurkje en wurde binne ien.
Many do not get that.	In protte krije dat net.
You can not, you just will not.	Jo kinne net, jo sille gewoan net.
He would not tell me why.	Hy soe my net fertelle wêrom.
We are very happy.	Wy binne tige bliid.
No problem.	Gjin probleem.
That would have to wait.	Dat soe wol wachtsje moatte.
This place used to be fun.	Dit plak wie eartiids leuk.
And that's hard.	En dat is dreech.
Try it and please let us know what you think !.	Besykje it en lit ús asjebleaft witte wat jo tinke!.
She is just so made.	Se is krekt sa makke.
You know if.	Jo witte oft.
There was none.	Der wie gjin.
He could not stop.	Hy koe net ophâlde.
I wondered how he got there.	Ik frege my ôf hoe't er dêr kaam.
We have no one here.	Wy hawwe hjir gjinien.
It's all made.	It is allegear makke.
It's one of those things.	It is ien fan dy dingen.
He does not matter.	Hy makket neat út.
I still have them.	Ik haw se noch.
They talk to me about everything.	Se prate mei my oer alles.
So much better, maybe.	Sa folle better, miskien.
I want to win.	Ik wol winne.
Well, we were wrong.	No, wy wiene ferkeard.
Not if there was anything in front of him.	Net as der wat foar him yn siet.
But it did not come.	Mar it kaam net.
That's the problem here.	Dat is it probleem hjir.
Maybe he was just what she needed.	Miskien wie hy krekt wat se nedich wie.
We take what we want when we want.	Wy nimme wat wy wolle as wy wolle.
You just do it.	Jo dogge it gewoan.
How much is too much or too little.	Hoefolle is te folle of te min.
I do want to.	Ik doch dat wol.
I do not know how he did that.	Ik wit net hoe't er dat die.
But imagine what it will be like when we get home again.	Mar tink hoe't it wêze sil as wy wer thús komme.
My best to you.	Myn bêste foar dy.
I want everything you have.	Ik wol alles wat jo hawwe.
I think my wife would stay with me.	Ik tink dat myn frou by my bliuwe soe.
On its own,.	Op himsels,.
He just got on with it.	Hy kaam der mar mei oan.
Now his children had something to eat.	No hiene syn bern wat te iten.
She was beautiful.	Se wie moai.
We love this place.	Wy hâlde fan dit plak.
It's very good.	It is hiel goed.
But if you love someone, this can be hard to do.	Mar as jo fan immen hâlde, kin dit dreech wêze om te dwaan.
Do not worry, this has nothing to do with you.	Sit gjin soargen, dit hat neat mei dy te krijen.
We love him here.	Wy hâlde fan him hjir.
It's pretty beautiful.	It is moai moai.
Walked to the door.	Rûn nei de doar.
The school was busy yesterday.	De skoalle wie juster drok.
There was no one left.	Der siet net ien mear yn.
I'm not sure it ever will.	Ik bin der net wis fan dat it oait sil.
It worked, but it was not a nice thing.	It wurke, mar it wie net in moai ding.
Not very good.	Hiel net goed.
He admitted it too.	Hy joech it ek ta.
Or that it is true for us, but not for them.	Of dat it foar ús wier is, mar foar har net.
We can not know.	Wy kinne it net witte.
I'm happy for you.	Ik bin bliid foar dy.
A few are well old.	In pear binne goed âld.
People were eating.	Minsken wiene oan it iten.
You here a lot.	Jo hjir in protte.
You will see them here.	Jo sille se hjir sjen.
I am happy to say that we are almost completely in agreement.	Ik bin bliid om te sizzen dat wy it hast hielendal iens binne.
His work must be very hard.	Syn wurk moat tige hurd wêze.
I had never seen her before.	Ik hie har noch noait earder sjoen.
Tell us about the class.	Fertel ús oer de klasse.
That's just one thing.	Dat is mar ien ding.
Maybe they can leave me, you can never tell.	Miskien kinne se my litte, kinne jo noait fertelle.
Dad saw me.	Heit seach my sjen.
I need to know more.	Ik moat mear witte.
You had a pretty good life.	Do hiest in aardich goed libben.
But he had never told anyone, and he could not tell her now.	Mar hy hie it noait oan ien ferteld, en hy koe it har no net fertelle.
I will have to be very careful though.	Ik sil wol hiel foarsichtich wêze moatte.
Bye bye.	Oant sjen.
This should be ready soon.	Dit moat gau klear wêze.
I have not found one yet.	Ik haw noch net ien fûn.
When we'm home, we do not.	As wy thús binne, dogge wy dat net.
I'm worried about those kids.	Ik meitsje my soargen oer dy bern.
And it happens again and again and again.	En it bart wer en wer en wer.
It's really nice to see.	It is echt moai om te sjen.
I made this.	Ik makke dit.
And maybe it does not matter.	En miskien makket it net út.
Is that your car there?	Is dat dyn auto dêr?
Can do it yourself too.	Kin it ek sels dwaan.
We think to do it.	Wy tinke om it te dwaan.
Well, there would not be much waiting for him now.	No, der soe no net folle op him wachtsje.
It's best to do a bit of both.	It is it bêste om in bytsje fan beide te dwaan.
I did not eat.	Ik ha net iten.
How can you know this yourself ?.	Hoe kinne jo dit sels witte?.
That's why,	Dat is wêrom,
And you pay nothing.	En jo betelje neat.
He's a good man.	Hy is in goed man.
I have none.	Ik ha gjin.
It must be hard for him to say anything.	It moat foar him dreech wêze om wat te sizzen.
Which was good.	Wat wie goed.
The same thing is happening today.	Itselde bart hjoed.
It was hard to keep up with the times.	It wie dreech om de tiid by te hâlden.
Then you have to wait.	Dan moatte jo wachtsje.
Something happened to him.	Der kaam him wat op.
He would come to give her a dog.	Hy soe kommen om har in hûn te jaan.
She has more time for him, lately.	Se hat mear tiid foar him, de lêste tiid.
She was not as fun as she used to be.	Se wie net sa leuk as eartiids.
You have to do this.	Jo moatte dit dwaan.
I love this place too much.	Ik hâld te folle fan dit plak.
And almost no one knows who they are.	En hast gjinien wit wa't se binne.
Anyone can see it.	Elkenien kin it sjen.
He says he can help find the person.	Hy seit dat er helpe kin om de persoan te finen.
But she did not want to go back, not really.	Mar se woe net werom, net echt.
I have to go now, he said.	Ik moat no gean, sei er.
I do not think anyone even knew it was there.	Ik tink net dat immen sels wist dat it der wie.
My mother did what she wanted.	Myn mem die wat se woe.
He would make things right.	Hy soe dingen goed meitsje.
Then again maybe not.	Dan wer miskien net.
No one can do this for you.	Nimmen kin dit foar jo dwaan.
They want something different.	Se wolle wat oars.
That would be ....	Dat soe ... wêze.
And here you are.	En hjir binne jo.
More about that here.	Mear oer dat hjir.
Not a single word of it.	Net ien wurd fan it.
I do not want to talk to you.	Ik wol net mei dy prate.
Hard work, that may be, but too late for me.	Hurd wurk, dat kin wêze, mar foar my te let.
She did not intend to stay.	Se wie net fan plan om te bliuwen.
And she's beautiful.	En se is moai.
I just could not.	Ik koe gewoan net.
He's probably the first person since.	Hy is wierskynlik de earste persoan sûnt.
''.	''.
I'm not that much for it.	Ik bin der net sa folle foar.
It just shows who he is.	It lit gewoan sjen wa't hy is.
But she could not stop now.	Mar se koe no net ophâlde.
My kids love him so much.	Myn bern hâlde sa folle fan him.
He somehow knew it was water.	Hy wist op ien of oare manier dat it wetter wie.
Well, until.	No, oant.
He looked at her.	Hy seach har oan.
There was no need to be afraid anymore.	Der hoegde net mear bang te wêzen.
That happened to him.	Dat barde him.
That never happened.	Dat is noait bard.
We do not like you at all.	Wy hâlde neat fan dy.
You're in the right place.	Jo binne op it goede plak.
Or so we were told.	Of sa waard ús ferteld.
It was fun to make.	It wie leuk om te meitsjen.
That was the first time it hit me.	Dat wie de earste kear dat it my rekke.
Not from me.	Net fan my.
And my family.	En myn famylje.
We do not need him anymore.	Wy hawwe him net mear nedich.
But many questions remain.	Mar noch in protte fragen bliuwe.
Do nothing else.	Doch neat oars.
I had actually heard that before.	Dat hie ik eins earder heard.
Do not doubt me anymore.	Twifelje net mear oan my.
And then it just goes on.	En dan giet it mar troch.
If something happens.	As der wat bart.
What it was.	Wat it wie.
They are in demand though.	Se binne wol yn fraach.
They were at home together almost every day.	Se wiene hast alle dagen by elkoar thús.
Not anymore.	Net mear.
It could be us.	It kin ús wêze.
See this well!	Sjoch dit goed!
Now that girl and this girl are the same girl.	No binne dat famke en dit famke itselde famke.
He can tell me.	Hy kin my fertelle.
I did not want to be out there.	Ik woe der net út wêze.
Here was her home.	Hjir wie har thús.
It had its time and place.	It hie syn tiid en plak.
Maybe he is.	Miskien is hy.
That is a word in itself.	Dat is in wurd op himsels.
I knew that well.	Dat wist ik goed.
They had not found one yet.	Se hiene noch gjin ien fûn.
I just love watching him.	Ik sjoch him gewoan graach.
Of course, this was not his room.	Fansels wie dit net syn keamer.
It can be found here.	It is hjir te finen.
But somehow he could not speak.	Mar op ien of oare manier koe er net prate.
She looked like she was going to get sick.	Se like derop dat se siik wurde soe.
They work every day.	Se wurkje alle dagen.
Maybe so, but no one will ever know.	Miskien is dat sa, mar gjinien sil it ea witte.
It should be fun to watch.	It moat leuk wêze om te sjen.
He was gone.	Hy wie fuort.
If only her mother were here.	As har mem hjir mar wie.
I will not have him in this house.	Ik sil him net yn dit hûs hawwe.
We were pretty hard on.	Wy wiene aardich hurd op.
It was pretty beautiful actually.	It wie moai moai eins.
I was surprised to find water.	Ik wie ferrast om wetter te finen.
Take you out.	Nim dy út.
That did that for me of course.	Dat die dat foar my fansels.
They were here for something.	Se wiene hjir foar wat.
But what we knew about.	Mar wat wy wisten oer.
But that was not me.	Mar dat wie ik net.
Yours does too.	Dyn docht ek.
I can not believe it works so well, but it does.	Ik kin net leauwe dat it sa goed wurket, mar it docht.
It could be something else.	It kin wat oars wêze.
They are real.	Se binne echt.
He admitted it.	Hy joech it ta.
That was exactly the case.	Dat wie krekt sa.
All right, kids, all right.	Goed, bern, goed.
If you already have one, good for you.	As jo ​​​​al ien hawwe, goed foar jo.
I do not know much of anything.	Ik wit net folle fan neat.
I have to do it.	Ik moat it dwaan.
Mine came to me like that.	Myn kaam sa by my ta.
I'm not quite ready.	Ik bin net hielendal klear.
Must be a dog.	Moast in hûn wêze.
Anyway, that's it for now.	Hoe dan ek, dat is it foar no.
But we do.	Mar dat dogge wy troch.
I was not good enough.	Ik wie net goed genôch.
They just could not do without each other.	Se koene gewoan net sûnder elkoar.
She is a beautiful girl.	Se is in moai famke.
Today we did.	Hjoed diene wy.
He would never have her.	Hy soe har nea hawwe.
I do not think he should be.	Ik tink net dat hy wêze moat.
He will tell you what he saw.	Hy sil dy fertelle wat er sjoen hat.
I did not look at the letter at once.	Ik seach net yn ien kear nei de brief.
Tell us what you know.	Fertel ús wat jo witte.
In the hope of buying time.	Yn 'e hope fan it keapjen fan tiid.
I have no idea where you live.	Ik haw gjin idee wêr't jo wenje.
A child could go where he wanted.	In bern mocht gean wêr't er woe.
That also works nicely.	Dat wurket ek aardich.
What could be better ?.	Wat kin better?.
Things are really bad.	Dingen binne echt min.
I worry about them.	Ik meitsje my soargen oer har.
We ask these things in your name.	Dizze dingen freegje wy yn jo namme.
It's too early to tell.	It is te betiid om te sizzen.
She ran as hard as she could.	Se rûn sa hurd as se koe.
What they could.	Wat se koene.
Neither is good.	Gjin fan beide is goed.
He will love it.	Hy sil der fan hâlde.
I had no idea what to say or how.	Ik hie gjin idee wat te sizzen of hoe.
I think you will be really happy.	Ik tink dat jo echt bliid sille wêze.
They needed money.	Se hiene jild nedich.
Same as.	Itselde as.
I'm your teacher.	Ik bin dyn learaar.
You can not take him.	Jo kinne him net nimme.
You will know it.	Jo sille it witte.
It did not hurt that she liked him too.	It die net sear dat se him ek leuk hie.
He looked around.	Hy seach om him hinne.
She came to stay with us.	Se kaam by ús te bliuwen.
Two were in the same person.	Twa wiene yn deselde persoan.
There seemed to be nothing.	Der like neat te wêzen.
That should say it all.	Dat moat alles sizze.
I only looked at it once.	Ik seach der mar ien kear nei.
But tell me.	Mar fertel my.
This seems like a really good one to you.	Dit liket in echt goede ien foar jo.
I just could not do the job.	Ik koe it wurk gewoan net dwaan.
They had not had their food.	Se hiene har iten net hân.
They just work, they come home, and they talk.	Se wurkje gewoan, se komme thús, en se prate.
It just happens, goes on and on.	It bart gewoan, giet troch en troch.
She wants him to know that she loves him.	Se wol him witte dat se fan him hâldt.
This kind of thing happens.	Dit soarte fan dingen barre.
I can not see the man.	Ik kin de man net sjen.
We can do this.	Wy kinne dit dwaan.
He's with me.	Hy is by my.
Go back to school.	Gean werom nei skoalle.
I was over the moon.	Ik wie oer de moanne.
I'm just back from him.	Ik bin krekt werom fan him.
I know he was one of them.	Ik wit dat hy fan har wie.
They really do not know what they are talking about.	Se witte echt net wêr't se it oer hawwe.
I was ready to go.	Ik wie klear om te gean.
I must have put my hand in my hair.	Ik moat de hân yn it hier hân hawwe.
I had planned to get involved with it.	Ik hie fan plan west om my dêr mei te dwaan.
She likes everything he does.	Se wol graach alles wat er docht.
We are not like these people.	Wy binne net as dizze minsken.
Go with the one who works for you.	Gean mei dejinge dy't foar jo wurket.
I was out of the office and it was late.	Ik wie út it kantoar en it wie let.
I can better see what work needs to be done.	Ik kin better sjen hokker wurk dien wurde moat.
Then they let you go.	Dan litte se dy gean.
She was angry but did not want to show it.	Se wie lilk, mar woe it net sjen litte.
It will never get better than this.	It sil noait better wurde as dit.
I made nothing out of it.	Ik makke der neat út.
It's still good.	It is noch goed.
I know what it has done to me and my family.	Ik wit wat it mei my en myn famylje dien hat.
I can say no more.	Ik kin net mear sizze.
There are only a few days left.	Der binne noch mar in pear dagen oer.
I'm ok.	It giet goed mei my.
There was one first.	Der wie earst ien.
She did not see me.	Se seach my net.
That gave him an idea.	Dat joech him in idee.
He left the door open.	Hy liet de doar iepen.
Be sure to make a plan.	Wês wis dat jo in plan meitsje.
I did not see anyone.	Ik seach net ien.
It goes well with her.	It komt goed mei har.
It is not so.	It is sa net.
We would both.	Wy soene beide.
Everyone will believe him.	Elkenien sil him leauwe.
I have to stop now.	Ik moat no ophâlde.
He thinks, maybe he can get her back.	Hy tinkt, miskien kin er har werom krije.
I found it again.	Ik fûn it wer.
I thought of my children.	Ik tocht oan myn bern.
It was so.	It wie sa.
But this girl.	Mar dit famke.
What was real? 	Wat wie echt?
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
Do not come here again.	Kom hjir net mear om.
Of course, he realized.	Fansels, hy realisearre.
I was also a little worried.	Ik wie ek in bytsje soargen.
My mother tried to help me the best she could.	Myn mem besocht my it bêste te helpen dat se koe.
We all need to think about these issues.	Wy moatte allegear tinke oan dizze problemen.
But soon he will speak.	Mar gau sil er prate.
We believe in trying it out before you buy it.	Wy leauwe yn besykje it foardat jo it keapje.
Work hard at school.	Wurkje hurd op skoalle.
It's better than nothing.	It is better as neat.
We are made.	Wy binne makke.
More on that in a bit.	Mear oer dat yn in bytsje.
Either this would work or it would not.	Of dit soe wurkje of it soe net.
To me, it seems too much.	Foar my liket it te folle.
You've seen it happen before.	Jo hawwe it earder barre sjoen.
Nothing comes out.	Der komt neat út.
He needs it.	Hy hat it nedich.
Truth.	Wierheid.
And it's not good.	En it is net goed.
She must be so sick.	Se moat sa siik wêze.
Everyone does it.	Elkenien docht it.
So, that's how we started.	Sa, dat is hoe't wy begûn.
None of that will make it go away.	Gjin fan dat sil meitsje it gean fuort.
Things are getting better.	Dingen wurde better.
Not if they did not work.	Net as se net wurke.
It still hurts me.	It docht my noch sear.
If not, like well.	As net, like goed.
She took it over.	Se naam it oer.
They just decided this was not good.	Se besletten gewoan dat dit net goed wie.
Let is let.	Let is let.
When she gave it to him, he gave it back.	Doe't se it him joech, joech er it werom.
Children will be children.	Bern sille bern wêze.
It's the net.	Dit die net.
Well, that's not true.	No, dat is net wier.
Not my favorite, but something else.	Net myn favorite, mar wat oars.
He needs to see.	Hy moat sjen.
He's a bad dog.	Hy is in minne hûn.
She never told me what it was.	Se hat my noait ferteld wat it wie.
No one should know it.	Nimmen soe it witte moatte.
But this was more than a few.	Mar dit wie mear as in pear.
It's who she is.	It is wa't se is.
She loves him.	Se hâldt fan him.
She's out.	Se is út.
He was scared.	Hy wie bang.
How can you tell?	Hoe kinne jo fertelle?
It did for me of course.	It die foar my fansels.
It felt good.	It fielde goed.
Has seen them.	Hat se sjoen.
You can not take them from me.	Jo kinne se net fan my nimme.
He needs to talk.	Hy moat prate.
I'm so sorry how hard it has been.	It spyt my sa dreech hoe dreech it west hat.
He just did a very good job.	Hy die net in hiel goed wurk.
We are all here now.	Wy binne hjir no allegear.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Alles like goed gien te wêzen.
It's out of the question.	It is út 'e fraach.
I wonder if this is good.	Ik freegje my ôf oft dit goed is.
But it did not matter why.	Mar it makke net út wêrom.
But it's going well.	Mar it komt wol goed.
Not this room.	Net dizze keamer.
You keep at it.	Jo hâlde der oan.
He asked where else.	Hy frege wêr oars.
They could never leave.	Se koene noait fuort.
The truth is that no one knows where it came from.	De wierheid is dat gjinien wit wêr't it wei kaam.
We think they are pretty good.	Wy tinke dat se aardich goed binne.
There was never enough food, never enough water.	Der wie nea genôch iten, nea genôch wetter.
But your time is long overdue.	Mar dyn tiid is lang om let.
I do not know how to help her.	Ik wit net hoe ik har helpe moat.
And much more.	En noch folle mear.
There is no one there.	Dêr is gjinien.
They were in big trouble.	Se wiene yn grutte problemen.
There can only be one.	Der kin mar ien wêze.
It's true, the hours are hard.	It is wier, de oeren binne dreech.
I love life.	Ik hâld fan it libben.
That's really what this is about.	Dat is echt wêr't dit oer giet.
His chance presented itself.	Syn kâns die him foar.
I'm not buying the next book.	Ik keapje it folgjende boek net.
So she waited.	Sa wachte se.
Just had to say it.	Moast it mar sizze.
I'm not so scared.	Ik bin net sa bang.
No one knows what, or how much.	Nimmen wit wat, of hoefolle.
Here there was only one.	Hjir wie der mar ien.
They really want to be kids.	Se wolle echt bern wêze.
This year, we still haven’t gotten it quite right.	Dit jier hawwe wy it noch net hielendal goed krigen.
It happens every day.	It bart alle dagen.
This never goes away.	Dit giet noait fuort.
What kind of work do you do here?	Wat foar wurk dogge jo hjir?
This man can play.	Dizze man kin spylje.
He would see her for the first time.	Hy soe har foar it earst sjen.
And it has not happened often.	En it is net faak bard.
Not true.	Net wier.
We could not have done this without him.	Wy koene dit net sûnder him.
That soon became a problem.	Dat waard al gau in probleem.
It really had been.	It wie echt west.
I just know it's the place.	Ik wit gewoan dat it it plak is.
I did something good.	Ik die wat goed.
We will stay here again if needed.	Wy sille bliuwe hjir wer as it nedich is.
She always had a nice word for everyone.	Se hie altyd in aardich wurd foar elkenien.
We were here to help.	Wy wiene hjir om te helpen.
Make food together.	Meitsje tegearre iten.
You can get back to work tomorrow.	Jo kinne moarn wer oan it wurk.
She felt the words.	Se fielde de wurden.
I think you will like him very much.	Ik tink dat jo him tige leuk fine.
You have a life.	Jo hawwe in libben.
And now it was done.	En no wie it dien.
This is not just about us.	Dit giet net allinnich oer ús.
She started to look a little better.	Se begûn wat better te sjen.
She had seen more of him than she had ever hoped.	Se hie mear fan him sjoen as se ea hope hie.
I tried to tell him that.	Ik besocht him dat te sizzen.
As they say, who knew ?.	As se sizze, wa wist?.
I will never ask you again.	Ik sil dy noait wer freegje.
He would love them.	Hy soe se hâlde.
But really good people.	Mar echt goede minsken.
Be husband and wife.	Man en frou wêze.
Not even thinking of going back.	Net iens tinke om werom te gean.
He could see nothing wrong.	Hy koe neat ferkeard sjen.
Everyone would want to work with you.	Elkenien soe mei dy wurkje wolle.
That was your father.	Dat wie dyn heit.
I was reading.	Ik wie oan it lêzen.
I never was.	Ik wie noait.
I think he will.	Ik tink dat hy sil.
You do not want a man.	Jo wolle gjin man.
I was not expecting a wife.	Ik hie gjin frou ferwachte.
Everyone has tried.	Elkenien hat besocht.
Without a mother or a father.	Sûnder in mem of in heit.
I know nothing of her.	Ik wit neat fan har.
You can still do this.	Jo kinne dit noch dwaan.
It felt like just one person to me.	It fielde as mar ien persoan foar my.
Now we have to work.	No moatte wy wurkje.
Do not make friends.	Net meitsje freonen.
Maybe that's true.	Miskien is dat wier.
Make sure everything is ready.	Wês wis dat alles klear is.
It was the first time she had told anyone the truth.	It wie de earste kear dat se immen de wierheid fertelde.
It was still good.	It wie noch goed.
We can be here forever.	Wy kinne hjir foar altyd wêze.
She could not find it.	Se koe it net fine.
She had him there.	Se hie him dêr.
I would love to see that happen in his life.	Ik soe graach sjen dat it barre yn syn libben.
Not to be with her when she needed him.	Om net by har te wêzen as se him nedich hie.
It's really nice.	It is echt moai.
We're going back.	Wy geane werom.
To keep him me.	Om him te hâlden my.
So it works well at first.	Sa wurket it earst goed.
Good at what he does.	Goed yn wat er docht.
There are no problems with this.	Der binne gjin problemen mei dizze.
He should talk to him about that.	Dêr soe er mei him oer prate moatte.
That was the way to do it.	Dat wie de manier om it te dwaan.
The first one worked well.	De earste hat goed wurke.
I'm not really like that.	Ik bin net echt sa.
This is how you do it.	Dit is hoe't jo it dogge.
I want to be a new self.	Ik wol in nije ik wêze.
More than once she had made him very angry.	Mear as ien kear hie se him tige lilk makke.
I need help to say that enough is enough.	Ik haw help nedich om te sizzen dat genôch is genôch.
The boy continued with food.	De jonge gie troch mei iten.
She had something to say to those people.	Se hie wat te sizzen tsjin dy minsken.
We'll show it to you again.	Wy sille it dy wer sjen litte.
It must be good.	It moat goed wêze.
He should have given her a chance.	Hy hie har in kâns jaan moatten.
You could not pay him enough money to do it.	Jo koene him net genôch jild betelje om it te dwaan.
He had a bad one.	Hy hie in min.
Do it if you want to, or not.	Doch it as jo wolle, of net.
In truth, he had already been of great help.	Yn wierheid, hy hie al fan grutte help west.
He will not let it go.	Hy sil it net litte.
I just had food.	Ik ha krekt iten hân.
We are now only two.	Wy binne no mar twa.
I could play anything.	Ik koe alles spylje.
You could see it.	Jo koene it sjen.
He was not happy for long.	Hy wie net lang bliid.
You know where to find the room.	Jo witte wêr't de keamer te finen is.
Before this could happen, someone had to speak up.	Foardat dit barre koe, moast immen prate.
But it is not there.	Mar it is der net.
I will go and talk things over with him.	Ik sil gean en prate dingen oer mei him.
Never heard of him.	Nea fan him heard.
Well, look at my year, this year.	No, sjoch nei myn jier, dit jier.
It was enough to stop her.	It wie genôch om har tsjin te hâlden.
That, of course, would never happen.	Dat soe fansels noait barre.
She had done it again.	Se hie it wer dien.
This is not the way.	Dit is net de manier.
I love this car.	Ik hâld fan dizze auto.
I want the word "dog".	Ik wol it wurd "hûn".
But by now.	Mar troch no.
Not much else today.	Net folle oars hjoed.
No one has ever.	Gjinien hat oait.
I could never get through that again.	Dêr koe ik noait wer troch.
To someone, everyone.	Oan immen, elkenien.
And they can.	En dat kinne se.
He is angry at her.	Hy is lilk op har.
He did not think so yet.	Dat tocht er noch net.
Being a mom is hard.	Mem wêze is dreech.
I had no problem with that.	Dêr hie ik gjin probleem mei.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Better in soarte fan libben hawwe dan gjin libben.
It will do him good to come home.	It sil him goed dwaan om thús te kommen.
You had to go there.	Do moast der hinne.
One of those people is me.	Ien fan dy minsken bin ik.
He looked at me.	Hy seach my oan.
I did not know what he was talking about.	Ik wist net wêr't er it oer hie.
I was against having them in our house.	Ik wie tsjin dat se yn ús hûs ha.
I will try this.	Ik sil besykje dit.
To be with them.	Om by har te wêzen.
Even better was that no one knew who he was.	Noch better wie dat nimmen wist wa't hy wie.
And none of the work can be seen here.	En neat fan it wurk is hjir te sjen.
You know nothing.	Jo witte neat.
I had thought he was a good man.	Ik hie tocht dat er in goed man wie.
There is not enough time.	Der is net genôch tiid.
I know you do not want to believe this.	Ik wit dat jo dit net leauwe wolle.
Want to win.	Wol winne.
Glad you told me.	Bliid dat jo my ferteld hawwe.
They will go for it.	Se sille der foar gean.
This is what we want.	Dit wolle wy.
That should have been my word for the year.	Dat hie myn wurd foar it jier wêze moatten.
I just want to be home.	Ik wol gewoan thús wêze.
I'm not the person they need to be.	Ik bin net de persoan dy't se nedich binne.
She was not such a person.	Se wie net sa'n persoan.
And we do not stop there.	En dêr hâlde wy net op.
No need to give a reason.	Gjin reden hoecht te jaan.
You told him the truth.	Jo hawwe him de wierheid ferteld.
And it did not.	En it die net.
Do not show.	Net sjen litte.
It had not been long.	It hie noch net lang west.
Do not be interested in anything else.	Wês net ynteressearre yn wat oars.
He tried it.	Hy besocht it.
He sees a woman approaching him.	Hy sjocht in frou tsjin him oan kommen.
I have even been there a few times.	Ik haw der sels in pear kear west.
I'm not even sure whose idea it was.	Ik bin der net iens wis fan wa syn idee it wie.
But, you know, is what it is.	Mar, jo witte, is wat it is.
You have to want it though.	Jo moatte it wol.
Which should stop.	Wat ophâlde moat.
I can not, my friend.	Ik kin net, myn freon.
They will see him.	Se sille him sjen.
Both are doing very well.	Beide dogge it hiel goed.
Long time no see!	Lang net sjoen!
And probably something about how she was a really good friend.	En wierskynlik wat oer hoe't se in echt goede freon wie.
Take your things away and come with me.	Gean dyn dingen fuort en kom mei my.
You do not like this.	Jo fine dit net leuk.
She did not say.	Se sei net.
But that is something else.	Mar dat is wat oars.
Here's why.	Hjir is wêrom.
He walked over to her.	Hy rûn nei har ta.
That all this can be done for you.	Dat dit alles kin foar jo dien wurde.
You have two.	Jo hawwe twa.
It really became too much.	It waard echt te folle.
She wanted to agree with him, but had no better plan.	Se woe it mei him iens wêze, mar hie gjin better plan.
None of it is enough.	Gjin fan it is genôch.
And for good reason.	En foar goede reden.
I do not think you do.	Ik tink net dat jo dogge.
You two are in a lot of trouble.	Jo twa binne yn in protte problemen.
She will not see me here.	Se sil my hjir net sjen.
I was pretty sure she was not ready for that.	Ik wie aardich wis dat se der net klear foar wie.
But not everyone can do that.	Mar dat kin net elkenien.
Hope you win.	Hoopje dat jo winne.
The police let us go.	De plysje liet ús gean.
And set him free.	En meitsje him frij.
That’s what they all get.	Dat krije se allegear.
We can do it all.	Wy kinne it allegear dwaan.
Come with me.	Kom mei.
My friends will not talk to me.	Myn freonen sille net mei my prate.
He should just take it as a man.	Hy soe it mar nimme moatte as in man.
It does not matter how long it has been.	It makket net út hoe lang it west hat.
It does not look like that is happening.	It liket der net op dat dat bart.
And the new one is not much better.	En de nije is net folle better.
I have to say this.	Ik moat dit sizze.
They will win.	Se sille winne.
I'll be back here again.	Ik kom hjir wer werom.
I can not wait for this year.	Ik kin net wachtsje op dit jier.
She was as beautiful to me as she ever was.	Se wie like moai foar my as se oait wie.
He allowed that to her.	Hy mocht dat oan har.
You can do two things.	Jo kinne twa dingen dwaan.
If not I have one more idea.	As net haw ik noch ien idee.
He gave her a chance to participate.	Hy joech har in kâns om mei te dwaan.
Got all the help we needed.	Krige alle help dy't wy nedich hawwe.
I do not know what's going on.	Ik wit net wat der oan de hân is.
Here you will find many of my friends.	Hjir sille jo in protte fan myn freonen fine.
Maybe we talked back.	Miskien hawwe wy werom praat.
And then they try.	En dan besykje se.
She immediately had children.	Se krige fuort bern.
The first that many of the people there had seen.	De earste dy't in protte fan 'e minsken dêr sjoen hiene.
They had heard of him, of course.	Se hiene fan him heard, fansels.
He had bought it.	Hy hie it kocht.
That woman ran me out for no good reason.	Dy frou rûn my sûnder goede reden út.
It did her good.	It die har goed.
I opened the door and looked out.	Ik die de doar iepen en seach út.
I made it.	Ik haw it makke.
There's someone who must have seen something.	Der is ien dy't wat sjoen hawwe moat.
He had been there before.	Hy hie der earder west.
And ask for what you want.	En freegje om wat jo wolle.
We do not.	Wy net.
Nobody ever says that.	Nimmen seit it oait.
It did not look good, somehow.	It like net goed, op ien of oare manier.
It's still going on.	It giet noch troch.
Nothing there when she saw.	Neat dêr doe't se seach.
That, that's what we're sticking to.	Dat, dat is wêr't wy oan hâlde.
He could tell her now.	Hy koe it har no wol sizze.
He's coming back to her, he's sure.	Hy komt werom nei har, hy is wis.
With the police.	Mei de plysje.
I'm in.	Ik bin yn.
I help one here and there.	Ik help hjir en dêr ien.
From the first they ever have, to the last.	Fan de earste dy't se ea hawwe, oant de lêste.
Leave it until bought.	Lit it oant kocht.
Please do not talk anymore.	Graach net mear prate.
She really is who you think she is.	Se is echt wa't jo tinke dat se is.
The better he does with his job, the better his family does.	Hoe better mei syn wurk docht, hoe better syn famylje docht.
There must be a reason for what they are doing.	Der moat in reden wêze foar wat se dogge.
But there is more to it.	Mar der is mear oan it.
This may be the best.	Dit kin it bêste wêze.
I tried this but continued to have the same problem.	Ik besocht dit, mar bleau itselde probleem te hawwen.
It had so happened.	It wie sa bard.
She could do nothing else.	Se koe neat oars.
So the work goes on.	Sa giet it wurk troch.
We could do nothing there.	Wy koene dêr neat dwaan.
Now he wondered if he would ever see it again.	No frege er him ôf oft er it oait wer sjen soe.
I really should go back.	Ik soe echt werom moatte.
He did not want to think about that.	Dêr woe er net oan tinke.
They will help you.	Se sille jo helpe.
It was early and no one was coming in anymore.	It wie betiid en der kaam net ien mear yn.
Please come as soon as you can.	Kom asjebleaft, sa gau as jo kinne.
And here I am now.	En hjir bin ik no.
I would not stop it.	Ik soe it net ophâlde.
Your mother told me too.	Dyn mem fertelde my ek.
But now she was just trying to figure it out.	Mar no besocht se it mar troch te sjen.
What you like to do.	Wat jo graach dwaan.
They know what we have done.	Se witte wat wy dien hawwe.
It's nice to have friends and good food.	It is moai om freonen en goed iten te hawwen.
I agree, said the boy.	Ik mei iens, sei de jonge.
I kept it for everyone.	Ik haw it foar elkenien hâlden.
It's always been a bit, well off.	It hat altyd west in bytsje, goed ôf.
It made me tired.	It makke my wurch.
Then you can see.	Dan kinne jo sjen.
When the work was done, everyone went home.	Doe't it wurk dien wie, gie elkenien nei hûs.
She had to find something else.	Se moast wat oars fine.
I never had anyone to talk to.	Ik haw noait gjinien hân om mei te praten.
See it twice.	Sjoch it twa kear.
It does not matter where the child comes from.	It makket neat út wêr't it bern komt.
I'm a big fan.	Ik bin in grutte fan.
This happened earlier.	Dit barde earder.
If she's down there.	As se dêr ûnder is.
It's just too hard.	It is gewoan te dreech.
She was thirty.	Se wie tritich.
He was the same.	Hy wie itselde.
But that does not happen.	Mar dat bart net.
You did everything.	Do hast alles dien.
Though it will do you a little good.	Al sil it jo in bytsje goed dwaan.
I did not even know what he was talking about.	Ik wist net iens wêr't er it oer hie.
She looked beautiful when she was so angry.	Se seach der moai út as se sa lilk wie.
Whatever happens, do not do it.	Wat der ek bart, net dwaan.
He did not like that at all.	Dat mocht er hielendal net.
It's been such a long year.	It is sa'n lang jier west.
It's beautiful.	It is moai.
It obviously does not seem to be very common.	It liket fansels net hiel gewoan te wêzen.
And it was evening when they were ready.	En it wie jûn doe't se klear wiene.
Only young children.	Allinnich jonge bern.
But he had to do it, and it made him happy too.	Mar hy moast it dwaan, en it makke him ek bliid.
He looked cautiously around him.	Hy seach foarsichtich om him hinne.
What do you think of this book?	Wat fine jo fan dit boek?
He looked tired, she thought.	Hy seach der wurch út, tocht se.
Three from my mother.	Trije fan myn mem.
He was not wrong.	Hy wie net ferkeard.
asked the man.	frege de man.
With her too.	Mei har ek.
He, for one.	Hy, foar ien.
He did not have to say that to himself.	Dat hoegde er himsels net te sizzen.
More than that, he knew it was the truth.	Mear dan dat, hy wist dat it de wierheid wie.
It was hard to say why he thought that was necessary.	It wie dreech om te sizzen wêrom't er dat nedich tocht.
We would hope they do.	Wy soene hoopje dat se dat dogge.
You did so well today.	Jo hawwe it hjoed sa goed dien.
That can be good and bad.	Dat kin goed en min.
I just live here.	Ik wenje hjir gewoan.
See them now.	Sjoch se no.
You get there.	Jo komme der oan.
He looked nice.	Hy seach der aardich út.
I should say something to her.	Ik soe wat tsjin har sizze moatte.
He would never be the same without her.	Hy soe nea itselde wêze sûnder har.
You will not get your house back.	Jo krije jo hûs net werom.
He was not happy with her.	Hy wie net bliid mei har.
What made that is.	Wat makke is dat.
He should have stopped, but he did not.	Hy hie ophâlde moatten, mar hy die net.
They've been there and done that.	Se ha der west en dat dien.
That was just so.	Dat wie krekt sa.
But a few worried that much.	Mar in pear soargen dat folle.
I'm ready.	Ik bin klear.
But one way to go.	Mar ien manier om te gean.
I'll have to go back for him.	Ik sil foar him werom moatte.
My parents were different.	Myn âlden wiene oars.
I'll tell you this.	Ik sil dy dit fertelle.
The word came around.	It wurd kaam om.
That you are here to stay.	Dat jo hjir binne om te bliuwen.
In that room.	Yn dy keamer.
Let everyone try something!	Lit elkenien wat besykje!
She had to take him.	Se moast him nimme.
He wants to talk.	Hy wol prate.
If you do not have one, do so.	As jo ​​​​gjin ien hawwe, meitsje it dan.
He lives here.	Hy wennet hjir.
I really did not have it.	Ik hie it echt net.
It will not help.	It sil net helpe.
But it did not work.	Mar it wurke net.
Go away to work.	Gean fuort oan it wurk.
I'm getting old with her.	Ik wurd mei har âld.
He said no more.	Hy sei net mear.
There is no reason to return the money.	D'r is gjin reden om it jild werom te jaan.
You just have to do it in the right place.	Jo moatte it gewoan op it goede plak dwaan.
Careful, he thought.	Foarsichtich, tocht er.
He opened the book.	Hy die it boek iepen.
He was just something else.	Hy wie krekt wat oars.
He knows it's my favorite day of the year.	Hy wit dat it myn favorite dei fan it jier is.
When he is with us, we are not afraid or worried.	As hy by ús is, binne wy ​​net bang of soargen.
I try to talk to him, but he seems to.	Ik besykje mei him te praten, mar hy liket.
She said she did too.	Se sei dat se ek dien hat.
I did not know what to do with him.	Ik wist net wat ik mei him dwaan moast.
But it was not enough.	Mar it wie net genôch.
What city is this?	Hokker stêd is dit?
Something needs to be done about that.	Dêr moat wat oan dien wurde.
Wait a minute.	Wachte noch wat.
Let's not even think about it.	Litte wy it net iens tinke.
Other people do.	Oare minsken dogge.
He ran as hard as he could.	Hy rûn sa hurd as er koe.
We're wondering how it's going.	Wy freegje ús ôf hoe't it giet.
I do not believe in that.	Dêr leau ik net yn.
It hurt so much.	It die sa sear.
Nothing like that, never again.	Neat sa, nea wer.
She left one morning and never came back.	Se gie op in moarn fuort en kaam noait werom.
He was not really a man.	Hy wie net echt in man.
I'm wrong.	Ik bin miskien.
Just maybe, but not here.	Krekt miskien, mar net hjir.
There we will stay.	Dêr sille wy bliuwe.
If he did not have it, he knew where he could get it.	As er it net hie, wist er wêr't er it krije koe.
It was really hard.	It wie echt dreech.
In fact, we do not know if she has hair or not.	Eins witte wy net oft se hier hat of net.
There is good and bad.	Der is goed en ferkeard.
The plan works.	It plan wurket.
But in this, he could.	Mar yn dizze, hy koe.
This is how it is done.	Sa wurdt it dien.
But she did not want to go home.	Mar se woe net nei hûs.
He knew how good he was, but it never went over him.	Hy wist hoe goed hy wie, mar it gie noait oer him.
Everything in its proper place.	Alles op syn goede plak.
It was your book.	It wie dyn boek.
I did not know you would be here.	Ik wist net dat jo hjir wêze soene.
He could not come without one.	Hy koe net sûnder ien komme.
He heard the water, but could not see it.	Hy hearde it wetter, mar koe it net sjen.
This I actually encountered earlier.	Dit kaam ik eins earder tsjin.
We also know nothing about her mother.	Fan har mem witte wy ek neat.
I took the job at once.	Ik naam it wurk yn ien kear oan.
She did not get it.	Se krige it net.
She was not sure.	Se wie der net wis fan.
But, you know, it's true.	Mar, jo witte, it is wier.
She gave the weekend a party for her friends.	Se joech it wykein in feest foar har freonen.
That would be easy.	Dat soe maklik wêze.
You can have whatever you want.	Jo kinne hawwe wat jo wolle.
She leaves it too late.	Se lit it te let fuort.
People were nice to us.	Minsken wiene aardich foar ús.
This can be done.	Dit kin dien wurde.
That car belongs to my father.	Dy auto is fan myn heit.
But maybe it's just as good.	Mar miskien is it like goed.
It will not hold.	It sil net hâlde.
This is one of the good ones.	Dit is ien fan de goede.
But you have to be tired.	Mar jo moatte wurch wêze.
We can not afford that.	Wy kinne dat net betelje.
Go now and do not look back.	Gean no en sjoch net werom.
There live a few people.	Der wenje in pear minsken.
And he knows a thing or two.	En hy wit in ding as twa.
But it's not good for me.	Mar it is net goed foar my.
Your mother is angry at me again.	Dyn mem is wer lilk op my.
I had all three until yesterday.	Ik hie alle trije oant juster.
I really hope this is true.	Ik hoopje echt dat dit wier is.
It says wait.	It seit wachtsje.
She was tired but happy.	Se wie wurch, mar bliid.
That does not happen every day.	Dat bart net alle dagen.
What year is this year?	Hokker jier is dit jier?
Afraid he was too angry to stay.	Bang dat er te lilk wie om te bliuwen.
Nobody needs these things.	Nimmen hat dizze dingen nedich.
We could not make it.	Wy koene it net meitsje.
He walks away.	Hy giet fuort.
But it would never, he knew now.	Mar it soe noait, dat wist er no.
I never came back to that.	Dêr kaam ik noait op werom.
It's different.	It is oars.
Of course we let him help.	Fansels litte wy him helpe.
I feel her now.	Ik fiel har no.
As a girl.	As in famke.
It would take care of the problem itself.	It soe it probleem sels soargje.
These are really good and would help you a lot.	Dizze binne echt goed en soene jo in protte helpe.
That's your idea.	Dat is dyn idee.
Can I do that well too.	Kin dit ek goed dwaan.
Everyone, then you.	Elkenien, dan jo.
This is such a place.	Dit is sa'n plak.
See what he's talking about.	Sjoch wêr't er it oer hat.
My dad had everything ready.	Myn heit hie alles klear.
I will make.	Ik sil meitsje.
It seems like a pretty good plan.	It liket in aardich goed plan.
He does not even go to this school anymore.	Hy giet net iens mear nei dizze skoalle.
She always has.	Se hat altyd.
She was just beautiful.	Se wie gewoan moai.
Or he could have it on her.	Of hy koe it op har hawwe.
To be honest, he liked it that way.	Om wier te sizzen, sa hie er it graach.
I can see it now.	Ik kin it no sjen.
He would not take it anymore.	Hy soe it net mear oan.
Do not do this to them.	Dit mei se net dwaan.
It could do nothing.	It koe neat dwaan.
They have no reason not to take you either.	Se hawwe gjin reden om jo ek net te nimmen.
That I would say.	Dat soe ik sizze.
So do I.	Dat haw ik ek.
Just really tired.	Gewoan echt wurch.
This only happened every now and then.	Dit barde mar sa no en dan.
With my father.	Mei myn heit.
You believe they are, of course.	Jo leauwe dat se binne, fansels.
He knew he would never return here.	Hy wist dat er hjir nea werom soe.
Children have to go to school every day.	Bern moatte alle dagen nei skoalle.
We will know.	Wy sille witte.
She knows us.	Se ken ús.
The man said nothing to me.	De man sei tsjin my neat te sizzen.
But the door did not open.	Mar de doar gie net iepen.
I want one too.	Ik wol ek ien.
She wanted to say everything at once.	Se woe alles yn ien kear sizze.
I know people there.	Ik ken dêr minsken.
It was the best week of her life.	It wie de bêste wike fan har libben.
But this time it just felt different.	Mar dizze kear fielde it gewoan oars.
There was very little talk.	Der waard hiel min praat.
There is no place to go now.	Der is no gjin plak om te gean.
One day he might ask me about it.	Op in dei kin er my der wol nei freegje.
This, or so, made him around the room.	Dit, of sa, makke him om de keamer hinne.
However, she may already be home.	Hoe dan ek, se kin al thús wêze.
Tomorrow may be.	Moarn kin wêze.
The man himself, and not the woman.	De man sels, en net de frou.
She knew she had a problem.	Se wist dat se in probleem hie.
His father died when he was a child.	Syn heit stoar doe't er in bern wie.
But it did not matter.	Mar it makke neat út.
But they don’t have them that way.	Mar se hawwe se net sa.
It was my first book.	It wie myn earste boek.
The first is this.	De earste is dit.
You're a week mom.	Do bist in wike mem.
Tom is afraid of him, and with good reason.	Tom is bang foar him, en mei goede reden.
There was none.	Der wie gjin.
Or with the question.	Of mei de fraach.
And got better.	En better wurden.
He could not think.	Hy koe net tinke.
He clearly does not want to help me.	Hy wol my dúdlik net helpe.
We were three of us in a room.	Wy wiene trije fan ús yn in keamer.
Long ago, a few times.	Lang lyn, in pear kear.
I used to do it like that.	Ik die it eartiids sa.
Get back to bed.	Kom wer op bêd.
It still was.	It wie noch altyd.
That's one of his things.	Dat is ien fan syn dingen.
But even that did not make her happy.	Mar ek dat makke har net bliid.
And then he knows he's doing the right thing.	En hy wit dan dat hy it goede docht.
It makes everything different.	It makket alles oars.
And really.	En echt.
He will not talk to us.	Hy sil net mei ús prate.
In the morning his work was ready.	Yn 'e moarn wie syn wurk klear.
They are now off work.	Se binne no fan it wurk.
I heard them talking.	Ik hearde se praten.
Together we can do this.	Tegearre kinne wy ​​dit dwaan.
And could not believe it.	En koe it net leauwe.
The same day.	Deselde dei.
He asked for food, asked what was what.	Hy frege nei it iten, frege wat wat wie.
We had a little bit about that.	Dêr hiene wy ​​in bytsje oer.
I would be very happy to.	Ik soe wêze hiel bliid om.
Why so much? 	Wêrom safolle?
You have not.	Do hast net.
Nobody knows where he is.	Nimmen wit wêr't er is.
I want him here right now.	Ik wol him hjir no krekt.
We have been here for hours.	Wy hawwe hjir al oeren west.
Now let's make that work.	No litte wy dat wurk meitsje.
He does nothing.	Hy docht neat.
Not here, not now.	Net hjir, net no.
It's you, isn 't it?	It binne jo, is it net?
I think so.	Ik tink it.
And we let him do it.	En wy litte him it dwaan.
I also know who her father was.	Ik wit ek wa't har heit wie.
She will take good care of her children.	Se sil goed foar har bern soargje.
I do not feel bad.	Ik fiel my net min.
We know otherwise.	Wy witte oars.
There were no problems with the work.	Der wiene gjin problemen mei it wurk.
I do not know why or how this happened.	Ik wit net wêrom of hoe't dit barde.
They are really trying to do two things.	Se besykje echt twa dingen te dwaan.
He did not think so.	Hy tocht net.
We're doing well here.	Wy dogge it hjir goed.
He is in office now.	Hy is no op kantoar.
That's coming.	Dat komt wol.
Name, that's mine.	Namme, dat is myn.
Just not enough.	Krekt net genôch.
It could not.	It koe net.
Ran scared into the house.	Rûn bang it hûs yn.
My wife and I were talking.	Ik en myn frou wiene oan it praten.
But this time there was none.	Mar dizze kear wie der gjinien.
What makes you so sure?	Wat makket dy sa wis?
I have not decided whether to go out.	Ik haw net besletten oft te gean út.
To other people.	Oan oare minsken.
In the morning, really.	Fan 'e moarn, echt.
He could not find it.	Hy koe it net fine.
Give this to the boy.	Jou dit oan de jonge.
They have been pretty clear about that.	Dêr ha se aardich dúdlik oer west.
Let's go and see what's what.	Lit ús gean en sjen wat is wat.
But they did the work.	Mar se diene it wurk.
So nice to look out and see the water.	Sa moai om út te sjen en it wetter te sjen.
That she could no longer be.	Dat koe se net mear wêze.
Almost no one knew where they lived.	Hast gjinien wist wêr't se wenne.
Take the time to do it.	Nim de tiid om it te dwaan.
But he was not afraid anymore.	Mar hy wie net bang mear.
I'm not so sure what that was all about.	Ik bin der net sa wis fan wêr't dat allegear oer gie.
He met with.	Hy moete mei.
I would love to have one of these.	Ik soe graach hawwe ien fan dizze.
This one goes to work.	Dizze giet oan it wurk.
He is a man of his word.	Hy is in man fan syn wurd.
He does nothing for nothing.	Hy docht neat foar neat.
There I agree with you.	Dêr bin ik it mei dy iens.
It's just a movie, and he's just a man.	It is mar in film, en hy is mar in man.
But he saw nothing of it.	Mar dêr seach er neat fan.
I work hard.	Ik wurkje hurd.
That's not what it's about at all.	Dêr giet it hielendal net om.
Even if it seems to tell against him, go on.	Sels as it liket tsjin him te fertellen, gean troch.
I think that should look something up.	Ik tink dat moat wat sjen nei.
She tells me she loves me.	Se fertelle my dat se fan my hâlde.
I would not buy this again.	Ik soe dit net wer keapje.
She's been around a long time.	Se hat al lang west.
And so will he.	En sa sil hy.
He looked at me.	Hy seach nei my.
And it can be.	En it kin wêze.
But he would never.	Mar hy soe nea.
I'm not talking about you.	Ik ha it net oer dy.
But what had told her not to do that.	Mar wat hie har sein om dat net te dwaan.
We want them back.	Wy wolle har werom.
But whatever, man.	Mar wat dan ek, man.
She knew what had happened to her.	Se wist wat der mei har bard wie.
None worked well.	Gjin wurke goed.
None of it made it.	Gjin fan it makke it.
I have to go again.	Ik moat wer fuort.
And you will find that they just do not work.	En jo sille fine dat se gewoan net wurkje.
I know it's them.	Ik wit dat it se binne.
For hours and hours.	Foar oeren en oeren.
Together they have two children.	Tegearre hawwe se twa bern.
I had exactly the same problem.	Ik hie krekt itselde probleem.
They will have to work.	Se sille wurkje moatte.
One time is not enough.	Ien kear is net genôch.
But she still felt it.	Mar se fielde it noch.
Everyone does that.	Elkenien docht dat.
I did not participate in the talk.	Ik die net mei oan it praten.
Probably too much.	Wierskynlik te folle.
He needed something more.	Hy hie wat mear nedich.
He has held the seat ever since.	Hy hat sûnt dy tiid de sit hân.
There is no hope without it.	D'r is gjin hope sûnder it.
We'll make it that way.	Wy sille it sa meitsje.
In fact, you were better than good, you were good.	Eins wiene jo better as goed, jo wiene goed.
The door did not open.	De doar gie net iepen.
It was something else.	It wie wat oars.
This is not the same.	Dit is net itselde.
If you agree with me, even better.	As jo ​​it mei my iens binne, noch better.
What more could you ask for ?.	Wat kinne jo mear freegje?.
We're leaving as soon as we can.	Wy geane fuort sa gau as wy kinne.
Too busy to get away.	Te drok om fuort te kommen.
I'm so glad you could come.	Ik bin sa bliid dat jo komme koene.
It's really about the police.	It giet echt oer de plysje.
If given his word.	As jûn syn wurd.
You have to tell her.	Jo moatte it har fertelle.
I'm fine now.	Ik bin no goed.
I had never seen that before.	Dat hie ik noch noait earder sjoen.
But they obviously did not know.	Mar se wisten it fansels net.
The teacher is good.	De learaar is goed.
This was not true.	Dit wie net wier.
The animal looked up cautiously.	It bist seach foarsichtich op.
I saw the whole thing.	Ik seach it hiele ding.
And not many people do it.	En net folle minsken dogge it.
This is not me.	Dit bin ik net.
She can go, maybe not.	Se kin gean, miskien net.
That's the big problem.	Dat is it grutte probleem.
I'm here, man.	Ik bin hjir, man.
It's the only house she's ever had.	It is it ienige hûs dat se ea hie.
That she never was.	Dat wie se noait.
If work wants you to get them, then make work pay for them.	As wurk wol dat jo se krije, meitsje dan wurk foar har betelje.
What he is now.	Wat hy no is.
She worried about him.	Se makke har soargen oer him.
As if there was never a time when they did not like it.	As wie d'r noait in tiid dat se der net fan hâlde.
She did not have that and there it was.	Dat hie se net en dêr wie it.
If you want a nice home, you pay more.	As jo ​​​​in moai hûs wolle, betelje jo mear.
Maybe we could.	Miskien koene wy.
Their children are over them.	Har bern binne oer har.
I can help him with that.	Dêr kin ik him mei helpe.
And that was not all.	En dat wie net alles.
I think now for two.	Ik tink no foar twa.
He's not bad.	Hy is net min.
But of course he did not.	Mar dat hie er fansels net.
Well, it's back.	No, it is werom.
Did you know anything.	Wisten jo wat.
So he had not thought of it.	Sa hie er der net oan tocht.
On the spot.	Op it plak.
She is happy for him.	Se is bliid foar him.
So she thought about it too.	Sa tocht se der ek oer.
He came home late.	Hy kaam let thús.
That will never happen.	Dat sil nea barre.
But it's never too late.	Mar it is nea te let.
He had not found what he expected.	Hy hie net fûn wat er ferwachte.
Is easy and should be good.	Is maklik en moat goed wêze.
Let me know how this works.	Lit my witte hoe't dit wurket.
I do not know why she's talking to me about it.	Ik wit net wêrom se der mei my oer praat.
It was too early for the children to be home from school.	It wie te betiid foar de bern om thús te wêzen fan skoalle.
I know exactly what's going on in there.	Ik wit krekt wat der yn bart.
We know they are not.	Wy witte dat se net binne.
Do not be it.	Net wêze it.
Go out, go back.	Gean út, gean werom.
And if people need that, fine.	En as minsken dat nedich hawwe, goed.
You must have two of the three.	Jo moatte twa fan 'e trije hawwe.
We need to take you back ourselves.	Wy moatte jo sels werom nimme.
I took his money.	Ik naam syn jild.
Told me.	Fertelde my.
And in that first year.	En yn dat earste jier.
That book had really surprised him.	Dat boek hie him echt ferrast.
One more time.	Noch ien kear.
Everyone grows old.	Elkenien wurdt âld.
She will go, but he will not stay.	Se sil gean, mar hy sil net bliuwe.
As if he were doing that.	As soe er dat dwaan.
They make them so worried.	Se meitsje har sa soargen.
I can not stand it.	Ik kin it net oan.
But never scared.	Mar nea bang.
Almost completely out of the water.	Hast hielendal út it wetter.
I wanted to go to him.	Ik woe him gean.
Do you want to work another hour?	Wolle jo noch in oere wurkje?
But it could be.	Mar it soe wêze kinne.
Or would like to believe it.	Of soe it leauwe wolle.
That, of course, was clear.	Dat wie fansels dúdlik.
Nothing against him.	Neat tsjin him.
The first day was good.	De earste dei wie goed.
But look around.	Mar sjoch om.
But in my day it was something else.	Mar yn myn dei wie it wat oars.
Was he your friend?	Wie hy dyn freon?
It's a great job.	It is in grutte baan.
If you can get to it.	As jo ​​der oan komme kinne.
And it's mine.	En it is myn.
Hope you make it.	Hoopje dat jo it meitsje.
And do not worry about a thing.	En meitsje jo gjin soargen oer in ding.
I should never have left.	Ik hie noait fuort moatten.
She added it now.	Se joech har der no oan.
The words are still there.	De wurden binne der noch.
That's not how it should be.	Sa moat it net.
It would have been easy.	It hie maklik west.
That I could say.	Dat koe ik sizze.
I have you.	Ik haw dy.
This is also a family thing.	Dit is ek in famylje ding.
She would love to be a help to you.	Se soe graach wêze in help foar dy.
She had no job.	Se hie gjin wurk.
They look beautiful.	Se lykje moai.
And that he did very well.	En dat die hy hiel goed.
Get out of my car now.	Kom no út myn auto.
The food is better.	It iten is better.
We are worried.	Wy hawwe soargen.
I never thought about coming.	Ik haw noait tocht oer it kommen.
I worked on it, sure, but they put it together.	Ik wurke der oan, wis, mar se sette it tegearre.
I will never do that to a child of mine.	Dat sil ik noait oan in bern fan my dwaan.
That should have known.	Dat hiest witte moatten.
Her child was with her.	Har bern wie by har.
Think, he said.	Tink, sei er.
He just is.	Hy is gewoan.
We can see this just around us.	Wy kinne dit sjen gewoan om ús hinne.
I hope you did not go in there.	Ik hoopje dat jo der net yn gien binne.
He has done a lot.	Hy hat in protte dien.
He was just tired.	Hy wie gewoan wurch.
I had to ask about that too.	Dêr moast ik ek oer freegje.
You can do that over a weekend.	Jo kinne dat oer in wykein dwaan.
But it has only happened once before.	Mar it is noch mar ien kear earder bard.
He is not sure what is coming or what is expected of him.	Hy is net wis fan wat der komt of wat der fan him ferwachte wurdt.
Children, do not do this.	Bern, doch dit net.
Do we have enough water?	Hawwe wy genôch wetter?
It was easy to photograph.	It wie maklik om foto.
I know you work, but.	Ik wit dat jo wurkje, mar.
I looked at her and quickly looked away.	Ik seach nei har en seach gau fuort.
This was three days ago.	Dit wie trije dagen lyn.
I just wanted to say.	Ik woe gewoan sizze.
Three for three.	Trije foar trije.
We had a three day weekend ahead of us.	Wy hiene in trije dagen wykein foar ús.
But they never said what they needed.	Mar se hawwe nea sein wat se nedich hawwe.
And there is no reason to do so.	En d'r is gjin reden om dat te dwaan.
There is no way to make this happen.	D'r is gjin manier om dit barre te meitsjen.
I think a lot.	Ik tink in protte.
There is such a thing as being late.	Der is sa'n ding as te let.
Give him a few days.	Jou him in pear dagen.
It would not.	It soe net.
I will find them.	Ik sil se fine.
I handed it over without a word.	Ik joech it sûnder in wurd oer.
I was the first to see this.	Ik wie de earste dy't dit seach.
It would be a good idea.	It soe in goed idee wêze.
I truly believe we have enough here to go around.	Ik leau wier dat wy hjir genôch hawwe om hinne te gean.
You really have to try.	Jo moatte echt besykje.
For him, it was the same.	Foar him wie it itselde.
Well, we did it.	No, wy hawwe it dien.
It just may not work.	It kin gewoan net wurkje.
She told him to stop worrying.	Se fertelde him om op te hâlden mei soargen.
To do something.	Om wat te dwaan.
Many are different.	In protte binne oars.
He does not seem too happy to me.	Hy liket my net al te bliid.
We will show that this is not true.	Wy sille sjen litte dat dit net wier is.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
I had also thought about recording it last week.	Ik hie der ferline wike ek oer tocht om it op te nimmen.
You can not always stay a place.	Jo kinne net altyd in plak bliuwe.
He said and did nothing.	Hy sei en die neat.
You can really make them.	Jo kinne se echt meitsje.
But they had done more than that.	Mar se hiene mear dien as dat.
You can stay there tonight.	Jo kinne dêr fannacht bliuwe.
I am a very good mother.	Ik bin in hiel goede mem.
It's not just about food.	It giet net allinnich om iten.
But she was not, really.	Mar se wie net, wier.
That can be.	Dat kin wêze.
We said nothing, we waited.	Wy seine neat, wy wachtsje.
I could no longer.	Ik koe net mear.
They have children and you do not.	Se hawwe bern en do net.
I try to do my best.	Ik besykje it bêste te dwaan.
She thought she was having problems.	Se tocht dat se problemen hie.
You know they like to buy.	Jo witte dat se graach keapje.
I love that word.	Ik hâld fan dat wurd.
Everything will never be the same.	Alles sil noait itselde wêze.
I just want one.	Ik wol mar ien.
And of course there are many more.	En fansels binne der noch folle mear.
He would get no help.	Hy soe gjin help krije.
You would not believe it.	Jo soene it net leauwe.
They want to make money.	Se wolle jild meitsje.
These too will make you want more.	Ek dizze sille jo mear wolle.
We will never agree on that.	Dêr sille wy it noait oer iens wurde.
They want to see if you know what you are doing.	Se wolle sjen oft jo witte wat jo dogge.
I'm interested in your letter.	Ik bin ynteressearre yn jo brief.
It's pretty good.	It is goed goed.
This is true, very true.	Dit is wier, heul wier.
I must be wrong.	Ik moat ferkeard wêze.
It had been her home for so long.	It wie al sa lang har thús.
One of my favorite things to do.	Ien fan myn favorite dingen om te dwaan.
It was time to do it again.	It wie tiid om it wer te dwaan.
I'll do it.	Ik sil it dwaan.
This was like watching the same movie over and over again.	Dit wie as it sjen fan deselde film oer en wer.
That's exactly what she would do.	Dat soe se krekt dwaan.
Just visit me.	Besykje my gewoan.
Okay, we'll help you.	Goed, wy sille jo helpe.
We have very little time left.	Wy hawwe hiel min tiid oer.
They did it all.	Se hawwe it allegear dien.
Let them be.	Lit har wêze.
This is a really, really bad idea.	Dit is in echt, echt min idee.
We had just met.	Wy hiene krekt moete.
You ask more than many.	Jo freegje mear as in protte.
This time was no different.	Dizze kear wie net oars.
Nobody found it.	Nimmen hat it fûn.
I still have so many friends there.	Ik haw dêr noch safolle freonen.
He was gone.	Hy wie fuort.
We just let her go.	Wy litte har gewoan gean.
Long before my time.	Lang foar myn tiid.
I really do not know why.	Ik wit eins net wêrom.
We have no money for nothing.	Wy hawwe gjin jild foar neat.
Of course, you did not find them.	Fansels hawwe jo har net fûn.
Then, it seems.	Dan, it liket.
I think it was really good.	Ik tink dat it wie echt goed.
I know there is more.	Ik wit dat der mear is.
Now he was back.	No wie er werom.
The last person said this.	De lêste persoan sei dit.
I asked her why.	Ik frege har wêrom.
What would you do there.	Wat soene jo dêr dwaan.
That, of course, did not go so well.	Dat gie fansels net sa goed.
He just came up.	Hy kaam net op.
I watched him get out of my bed.	Ik seach him fan myn bêd ôf.
Everything is under you.	Alles is ûnder dy.
She could not.	Se koe it net.
I have not tried it, but it seems fun.	Ik haw it net besocht, mar it liket leuk.
I did not have any problems with it.	Ik haw der gjin problemen fan hân.
These people are on to something else.	Dizze minsken binne op wat oars.
I have to get this money out of here.	Ik moat dit jild hjir wei.
I had that.	Dat hie ik.
He was just waiting for her to make up her mind.	Hy wachte gewoan op har om har gedachten te meitsjen.
What is this.	Wat is dit.
Give or take a few years.	Jou of nim in pear jier.
I can do nothing for you.	Ik kin neat foar dy dwaan.
She was not only beautiful.	Se wie net allinnich moai.
For her, and for her mother.	Foar har, en foar har mem.
And my dog ​​should like him.	En myn hûn soe him leuk fine moatte.
It was probably a bit of both.	It wie wierskynlik in bytsje fan beide.
Lots of movies.	In protte film.
It is true in a way.	It is op in manier wier.
You're so open.	Do bist sa iepen.
To buy you.	Om jo te keapjen.
I did not want to either.	Ik woe ek net.
It's not pretty and would require some work.	It is net moai en soe wat wurk nedich wêze.
If you do not do that, you are doing something wrong.	As jo ​​dat net dogge, dogge jo wat ferkeard.
A few times, maybe.	In pear kear, miskien.
It's just like a woman.	It is krekt as in frou.
I do not know.	Dat wit ik net.
I knew there would be.	Ik wist dat der wêze soe.
He was afraid of her.	Hy wie bang foar har.
A little more, please?	In bytsje mear, asjebleaft?
He still has enough money left over.	Hy hat noch genôch jild oer.
It's all they want to talk about.	It is alles wêr't se oer prate wolle.
What is needed now is help.	Wat it no nedich is, is help.
In your other hand you hold a net.	Yn jo oare hân hâlde jo in net.
This as a child already happens.	Dit as bern bart al.
I had children.	Ik hie bern.
Of course,	Fansels,
There are many, many out there.	Der binne in protte, in protte út dêr.
As if it would never give up.	As soe it nea jaan.
After that, things will be what they will be.	Nei dy sille dingen wêze wat se sille wêze.
She was almost too tired to be scared.	Se wie hast te wurch om bang te wêzen.
That's what we're up to.	Dêr binne wy ​​oan ta.
We should not either.	Wy moatte ek net.
No one knew where he was going.	Nimmen wist wêr't er hinne gie.
I'm going to talk to her.	Ik gean mei har prate.
Well, it is no longer in question.	No, it is net mear yn fraach.
And he took me.	En hy naam my.
It was not me.	It wie my net.
He had been a boy.	Hy hie in jonge west.
It will come, if you want it to come.	It sil komme, as jo wolle dat it komt.
Why not have it all ?.	Wêrom net hawwe it allegear?.
Everyone should keep this in mind.	Elkenien moat dit yn gedachten hâlde.
Get to it.	Kom der oan ta.
She did what he told her to do.	Se die wat er fertelde har te dwaan.
There was something different about her.	Der wie wat oars oan har.
They know it does not work so well.	Se witte dat it net sa goed wurket.
Eins, no twa.	Eins, no twa.
So we are always careful.	Sa binne wy ​​altyd foarsichtich.
Even if it's just one word.	Al is it mar ien wurd.
And it knows it.	En it wit it.
He saw me this week for everything he did.	Hy seach my de wike foar alles wat er die.
Remember him.	Tink noch oan him.
A good book is a good book.	In goed boek is in goed boek.
Your wife and children are with you.	Jo frou en bern binne by dy.
People can talk.	Minsken kinne prate.
I was sure it was something else.	Ik wie wis dat it wat oars wie.
He can not come home.	Hy kin net thús komme.
He should be here, but he's late.	Hy soe hjir wêze moatte, mar hy is let.
He liked it very much.	Hy fûn it tige leuk.
Just like that, he's up.	Krekt sa, hy is op.
The woman was angry.	De frou wie lilk.
Create what's in you.	Meitsje wat yn jo is.
It was where she heard.	It wie wêr't se hearde.
So it did its job there.	Sa die it dêr syn wurk.
I have never seen such a thing.	Ik haw noait sa'n ding sjoen.
There was no reason to.	Der wie gjin reden ta.
He was angry, and it.	Hy wie lilk, en it.
They are nothing but good to me.	Se binne neat oars as goed foar my.
We think this is unlikely.	Wy tinke dat dit net wierskynlik is.
And have even more to look forward to.	En hawwe noch mear om nei út te sjen.
The party goes on, whatever.	It feest giet, wat dan ek.
He just wants to be sure.	Hy wol gewoan wis wêze.
This is not how it should work.	Dit is net hoe't it moat wurkje.
But everyone knows it.	Mar elkenien wit it.
No one seemed surprised.	Nimmen like ferrast.
No one ever comes out.	Der komt noait ien út.
I'm almost three years old.	Ik bin hast trije jier âld.
Please be very careful.	Wês asjebleaft tige foarsichtich.
The same can be said of children.	Itselde kin sein wurde fan bern.
She would do nothing now.	Se soe no neat dwaan.
But it gave him nothing.	Mar it joech him neat.
What are we doing here? 	Wat hawwe wy hjir oan de hân?
she asked.	frege se har ôf.
I do not believe that myself.	Dat leau ik sels net.
There is such a thing.	Der is sa'n ding.
This is not how it should go.	Dit is net hoe't dit moat gean.
We would love to have you !.	Wy soene graach hawwe dy!.
Everyone does it differently too.	Elkenien docht se ek oars.
Maybe it's best to have him in the open.	Miskien is it it bêste om him yn 'e iepen te hawwen.
And this is exactly what's happening.	En dit is krekt wat der bart.
Nothing happened at first.	Der barde earst neat.
Not much.	Net folle.
Nothing else could be done for him.	Der koe neat oars foar him dien wurde.
It was one thing too many.	It wie ien ding te folle.
Or you should not.	Of jo moatte net.
The man who would become her husband was very angry.	De man dy't har man wurde soe, wie tige lilk.
There would be so much to do.	Der soe safolle te dwaan wêze.
The next time, the other would be ready.	De oare kear soe de oare klear wêze.
And little by little, life got better.	En bytsje by bytsje waard it libben better.
It made my day.	It makke myn dei.
Everything is so clear.	Alles is sa dúdlik.
I do not know what it was.	Ik wit net wat it wie.
You made it a few years ago.	Jo hawwe it in pear jier lyn makke.
If we could go away, we would, but we can not.	As wy fuort koene, soene wy ​​wol, mar wy kinne net.
Then it stops altogether.	Dan hâldt it hielendal op.
She said it was too late.	Se sei dat it te let wie.
I can not tell you how happy we are.	Ik kin dy net sizze hoe bliid wy binne.
Everything he wore he had made.	Alles wat er oan hie hie er makke.
I just want to be told.	Ik wol gewoan ferteld wurde.
But you have to go.	Mar jo moatte gean.
Well, you know better than to do that.	No, jo witte better dan dat te dwaan.
You did not know better.	Jo wisten net better.
In a.	Yn in.
Just stop talking.	Gewoan ophâlde mei praten.
He had heard nothing.	Hy hie neat heard.
It's just too much.	It is gewoan te folle.
It is not clear that this is what happened.	It is net dúdlik dat it sa bard is.
We often have back problems.	Wy hawwe faak werom problemen.
Mom never seems to have a problem.	Mem liket nea in probleem te hawwen.
Or well, almost none.	Of goed, hast gjinien.
She would get better.	Se soe better wurde.
And what is, is the truth.	En wat is, is de wierheid.
I thought about it.	Ik tocht der oer.
Now let me see her, let me look at her.	No lit my har sjen, lit my nei har sjen.
They will do everything for you.	Se sille alles foar jo dwaan.
Or a car.	Of in auto.
Show him your book.	Lit him dyn boek sjen.
It would be good.	It soe goed wêze.
I want that for my kids.	Ik wol dat foar myn bern.
Maybe he knew the girl was not his.	Miskien wist er dat it famke net fan him wie.
That's my question to you.	Dat is myn fraach oan dy.
We need to hurt them first.	Wy moatte se earst sear dwaan.
I have found the way.	Ik haw de wei fûn.
That she could play very well.	Dat koe se hiel goed spylje.
Well, more than one.	Goed, mear as ien.
He wanted to know where it could be.	Hy woe witte wêr't it wêze koe.
There was something just not right about it.	Der wie wat krekt net goed oer it.
Maybe just a little.	Miskien mar in bytsje.
That will do.	Dat sil dwaan.
What are they getting now?	Wat krije se no?
in.	yn.
She asked about it.	Se frege der om.
I saw what that did to my family.	Ik seach wat dat mei myn famylje die.
It has before.	It hat earder.
But he was good.	Mar hy wie goed.
He always had time for his children.	Hy hie altyd tiid foar syn bern.
That man lives in that house.	Dy man wennet yn dat hûs.
You do it again and again.	Jo dogge it wer en wer.
If the latter were true, she might tell the truth.	As dat lêste wier wie, soe se miskien de wierheid fertelle.
Please do not go out that door.	Gean asjebleaft net by dy doar út.
We have not even started.	Wy binne net iens begûn.
She seemed to be the only one who had a good time.	Se like de iennichste te wêzen dy't in goede tiid hie.
If you leave them.	As jo ​​litte se.
The whole city came to see him.	De hiele stêd kaam him te sjen.
I hope I could help.	Ik hoopje dat ik koe helpe.
This is not what you have.	Dit is net wat jo hawwe.
That's exactly who he looks like.	Dat is krekt op wa't er liket.
We are still open.	Wy binne noch iepen.
All right, all right.	Goed, goed.
I used to like your mother.	Ik mocht eartiids fan dyn mem.
If you like it, then buy it.	As jo ​​​​it leuk fine, keapje it dan.
I do not think we can do anything about it.	Ik tink net dat wy der wat oan dwaan kinne.
Let me know how it went.	Lit my witte hoe't it gie.
This is how it is.	Dit is hoe't it is.
He looked at me.	Hy seach my oan.
Probably no one does.	Wierskynlik gjinien docht.
Your life is now.	Jo libben is no.
You can not keep alive.	Jo kinne it libben net hâlde.
We want it all.	Wy wolle it allegear.
He is everything and more.	Hy is alles en mear.
A little about my wife needs to be told here.	In bytsje oer myn frou moat hjir ferteld wurde.
And then you come back for him.	En dan komme jo foar him werom.
Maybe he had just started.	Miskien wie er krekt begûn.
They are right here.	Se binne hjir krekt.
I knew something was happening to him, to us.	Ik wist dat der wat mei him barde, mei ús.
Now he was sure.	No wie er wis.
If only they knew they could do it too.	As se mar wisten dat se it ek kinne.
Or with his parents.	Of mei syn âlden.
Well, wait for it.	No, wachtsje derop.
It's not easy, it really is not.	It is net maklik, it is echt net.
Your money is not good today.	Jo jild is hjoed net goed.
It's not really a book.	It is net echt in boek.
He goes home.	Hy giet nei hûs.
Who knows, he may even ask for your help.	Wa wit kin er sels om jo help freegje.
That was a good idea.	Dat wie in goed idee.
I know he will.	Ik wit dat hy sil.
He never got it.	Hy hat it noait krigen.
This is how it should be done.	Sa moat it dien wurde.
They love you.	Se hâlde fan dy.
But you say it happened, well, it happened.	Mar jo sizze dat it barde, goed, it barde.
You have no money.	Jo hawwe gjin jild.
We're doing it right.	Wy dogge it goed.
Until then, you are free.	Oant dan binne jo frij.
I do not know why this is.	Ik wit net wêrom dit is.
I do not think this will ever happen again.	Ik tink net dat dit ea wer barre sil.
Whatever is needed.	Wat ek mar nedich is.
It's more than an hour by car to the city.	It is mear as in oere mei de auto nei de stêd.
We take nothing for granted here of course.	Wy nimme hjir neat foar fansels.
But that would never happen.	Mar dat soe nea barre.
I think what will happen.	Ik tink wat der barre sil.
Not even when they talk to us.	Ek net as se mei ús prate.
You put us back.	Jo sette ús werom.
It's late now.	It is no let.
I would not have a car there.	Ik soe dêr gjin auto hawwe.
Three of your year.	Trije fan jo jier.
Not many knew the truth yet.	Net folle wisten de wierheid noch.
Time is money.	Tiid is jild.
It's my last day.	It is myn lêste dei.
I needed a plan for next year.	Ik hie in plan nedich foar takom jier.
She always arrives late at school.	Se komt altyd te let op skoalle.
I can work hard.	Ik kin hurd wurkje.
They believe in children.	Se leauwe yn bern.
So it was now.	Sa wie it no.
Maybe he'll never see her again.	Miskien sil er har noait wer sjen.
I never asked him.	Ik haw him noait frege.
That is not clear.	Dat is net dúdlik.
Here is the letter.	Hjir is de brief.
Give him what he wants.	Jou him wat er wol.
She should have done it, she would.	Se hie it dwaan moatten, soe se.
I'm pretty easy.	Ik bin frij maklik.
It could be the evening.	It soe de jûn wurde kinne.
I thought you might like to see him.	Ik tocht dat jo him graach sjen kinne.
I'm going back to school.	Ik gean werom nei skoalle.
Must be fun !.	Moat leuk wêze!.
He is your friend.	Hy is dyn freon.
Two things were true.	Twa dingen wiene wier.
He wants to know who the man is.	Hy wol witte wa't de man is.
When did people get that.	Wannear krigen minsken sa.
My father is fine.	Myn heit is goed.
That she had seen this about me.	Dat se dit oer my sjoen hie.
I will say it one last time.	Ik sil it noch in lêste kear sizze.
Anything can happen.	Alles kin barre.
That would be good.	Dat soe goed wêze.
I was.	Ik wier.
It used to be once a year.	It wie eartiids ien kear yn it jier.
Let's see him.	Litte wy him sjen.
She told him she had to work late.	Se fertelde him dat se let wurkje moast.
It did not seem so.	It like der net ta.
There he can no longer return.	Dêr kin er net mear werom.
You just do.	Jo gewoan dwaan.
It was hard for me.	It wie dreech foar my.
I was not sure or working.	Ik wie net wis of wurke.
But he did not say much.	Mar hy sei net folle.
I saw that man.	Ik seach dy man.
I do not know what to think of him now.	Ik wit net wat ik no fan him tinke moat.
It was time.	It waard tiid.
He may not know it.	Hy kin it net witte.
Today it was not.	Hjoed wie it net.
Nothing else will do.	Neat oars sil dwaan.
This letter is for me.	Dizze brief is foar my.
What should we do today?	Wat moatte wy hjoed dwaan?
After dinner, the girl went to bed.	Nei it iten gie it famke op bêd.
If you are wrong, you have a chance.	As jo ​​ferkeard binne, hawwe jo in kâns.
In fact, it does not matter.	Eins makket it neat út.
I felt sure this was him.	Ik fielde der wis fan dat dit him wie.
We just have to do our job.	Wy moatte gewoan ús wurk dwaan.
I wanted to know more.	Ik woe mear witte.
The things she said.	De dingen dy't se sei.
Leave your whole evening free for this.	Lit jo hiele jûn frij foar dizze.
He made her mother.	Hy makke har mem.
But it must be said.	Mar it moat sein wurde.
He lives there now.	Hy wennet dêr no.
To do with them.	Mei har te dwaan.
But the family is fine.	Mar de famylje is goed.
He wanted to ask her why.	Hy woe har freegje wêrom.
The month began with a full moon.	De moanne begûn mei in folle moanne.
I think you know that.	Ik tink dat jo dat witte.
I believe the time is now.	Ik leau dat de tiid no is.
He knew so many people.	Hy koe safolle minsken.
No one knew her, or what she did.	Gjinien koe har, of wat se die.
You do not know what you are doing or what you need to do.	Jo witte net wat jo dogge of wat jo moatte dwaan.
Until it happened to me.	Oant it my barde.
I was walking with a woman.	Ik rûn mei in frou.
She was one of a kind.	Se wie ien fan in soarte.
He will do well.	Hy sil it wol goed dwaan.
They are at home.	Se binne by it hûs.
We're really glad you're here.	Wy binne echt bliid dat jo hjir binne.
I think she did.	Ik tink dat se it die.
And they told me not to come back.	En se seine my net werom te kommen.
It's been really good.	It is echt goed west.
She worries about it.	Se makket har soargen oer.
I have them now.	Ik haw se no.
I have some questions about that.	Dêr haw ik wat fragen oer.
He never asked for anything.	Hy hat noait wat frege.
Do not pretend he did not.	Net dwaan oft er it net die.
See what you say.	Sjoch wat jo sizze.
They are like children.	Se binne as bern.
But that's life.	Mar dat is it libben.
He did not want to be found.	Hy woe net fûn wurde.
But no one would take us.	Mar nimmen soe ús nimme.
But you, you are different.	Mar do, do bist oars.
I had neither.	Ik hie gjin beide.
He has had a good life here.	Hy hat hjir in goed libben hân.
They will probably not live together.	Se sille nei alle gedachten net tegearre wenje.
Two for three.	Twa foar trije.
She decided it herself.	Se hat it sels besletten.
I had not yet begun life.	Ik wie noch net begûn mei it libben.
It's a good city.	It is in goede stêd.
Everything will do, really.	Alles sil dwaan, echt.
We had it in three days.	Wy hiene it yn trije dagen.
More than one.	Mear as ien.
What kind of work do you think he does?	Wat foar wurk tinksto dat hy docht?
He just wanted me.	Hy woe krekt my.
I should have been happy.	Ik hie bliid wêze moatten.
I do not get out of there of course.	Ik kom der net út fansels.
That's really true.	Dat is echt wier.
I'll tell her.	Ik sil it har fertelle.
I got good at it.	Ik waard der goed yn.
We become better people.	Wy wurde bettere minsken.
The only thing to do was watch the movie.	It ienige ding om te dwaan wie de film te sjen.
He did not see how he could.	Hy seach net hoe't er koe.
You know you want to get one yourself.	Jo witte dat jo sels ien wolle krije.
I just think of you as.	Ik tink gewoan oan dy as.
There does not have to be.	Der hoecht net te wêzen.
She has a lot to say.	Se hat in protte te sizzen.
She said she did not.	Se sei dat se net hie.
I'll play her a movie.	Ik sil har in film spylje.
I want to know what he knows.	Ik wol witte wat er wit.
But he knew it was more than that.	Mar hy wist dat it mear wie as dat.
Well, that happened.	No, dat barde.
It all goes out.	Giet it allegear út.
But she wanted something.	Mar se woe wat.
But it was the right thing to do.	Mar it wie it goede ding om te dwaan.
You know what, let's just say it is.	Jo witte wat, litte wy mar sizze dat it is.
But right now I do not.	Mar krekt no ik net.
Are even talking about.	Binne sels praten oer.
Where you live does not matter.	Wêr't jo wenje makket neat út.
That was a good reason.	Dat wie in goede reden.
That could have been earlier.	Dat koe earder west hawwe.
He asked the man his name.	Hy frege de man syn namme.
This movie has issues.	Dizze film hat problemen.
We waited for him for two days.	Wy hawwe twa dagen op him wachte.
But it did.	Mar it die.
I've seen how he is with her.	Ik haw sjoen hoe't er mei har is.
No one came to help her.	Gjinien kaam har te helpen.
It's not common, but it does happen.	It is net gewoan, mar it bart wol.
Clearly, that did not happen.	Dúdlik is dat net bard.
I'm worried about you.	Ik meitsje my soargen om dy.
He was family.	Hy wie famylje.
I do not want to know.	Ik wol it net witte.
We are all tired.	Wy binne allegear wurch.
And that was for the best.	En dat wie foar it bêste.
He looks at me cautiously.	Hy sjocht my foarsichtich yn.
And that went on for far too long.	En dat gie al te lang troch.
She said it felt good.	Se sei dat it goed fielde.
It would be good to be home.	It soe goed wêze om thús te wêzen.
Three problems with this.	Trije problemen mei dizze.
She did not have him.	Se hie him net.
They really love her.	Se hâlde echt fan har.
It would never be enough.	It soe nea genôch wêze.
That was not good.	Dat wie net goed.
And she's in trouble.	En se sit yn de problemen.
All in one day work.	Alles yn in dei wurk.
This kind of surprises me.	Dit soarte fan ferrast my.
They have not liked it for a long time.	Se hawwe it al lang net leuk.
It's too early to tell.	It is te betiid om te sizzen.
So good, so good.	Sa goed, sa goed.
This was just not good.	Dit wie gewoan net goed.
We had done it.	Wy hiene it dien.
You're almost free at home.	Do bist hast thús frij.
And he would like it if it were different.	En hy soe it wol leuk fine as it oars wie.
I had just met you.	Ik hie dy krekt moete.
I look forward to going back to work very soon.	Ik sjoch der nei út om heul gau werom te gean nei it wurk.
You can not, and with good reason.	Jo kinne net, en mei goede reden.
Everyone was scared of her.	Elkenien wie bang foar har.
I try to take the time to really see.	Ik besykje de tiid te nimmen om echt te sjen.
My father is late.	Myn heit is let.
I'm sure it was the best he could find.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it wie it bêste hy koe fine.
We decided to buy a house.	Wy besletten om in hûs te keapjen.
I'm not sure they have a name.	Ik bin der net wis fan dat se hawwe in namme.
It ran away when it saw him.	It rûn fuort doe't it him seach.
I live here now.	Ik wenje hjir no.
I wondered where they were coming from.	Ik frege my ôf wêr't se wei komme.
Be careful, please.	Wês foarsichtich, asjebleaft.
That's not what we have here.	Dat is net wat wy hjir hawwe.
And then you.	En dan dy.
This works for now.	Dit wurket foar no.
Wish for money.	Winskje foar jild.
My mother was gone.	Myn mem wie fuort.
We can not be together.	Wy kinne net tegearre wêze.
And, you know, she's a mother.	En, jo witte, se is in mem.
They could not do otherwise.	Se koene net mear oars.
Can be, can not.	Kin wêze, kin net.
I do not really know.	Ik wit it net echt.
The photo shows a man and woman.	De foto lit in man en frou sjen.
I'm not making myself clear.	Ik meitsje my net dúdlik.
They want to do their job.	Se wolle har wurk dwaan.
I did not do it often.	Ik die it net faak.
I feel right away.	Ik fiel my fuort fuort.
That's my favorite thing about him.	Dat is myn favorite ding oer him.
It was somehow too early.	It wie op ien of oare manier te betiid.
Everything looked different.	Alles seach der oars út.
He is the best at what he does.	Hy is de bêste yn wat er docht.
He was very happy.	Hy wie tige bliid.
He was angry, and he wanted to stay that way.	Hy wie lilk, en hy woe sa bliuwe.
I'm going for help.	Ik gean om help.
You better go.	Jo kinne better gean.
In fact, there are a few of us.	Eins binne in pear fan ús.
She quickly looked away.	Se seach gau fuort.
That's what it would take to be a father.	Dat is wat it soe nimme om in heit.
We say that husband and wife used to be one.	Wy sizze dat man en frou earder ien wiene.
He can come from anything and anything in our house.	Hy kin fan alles en noch wat yn ús hûs komme.
That wants to be him.	Dat wol him wêze.
He started over.	Hy begûn oer.
I do not think it can.	Ik tink net dat it kin.
He had his husband.	Hy hie syn man.
And she was angry too.	En se wie ek lilk.
But he wanted to wait.	Mar hy woe wachtsje.
She opened the book and started reading.	Se die it boek iepen en begûn te lêzen.
Those were the best people we had.	Dat wiene de bêste minsken dy't wy hiene.
You know how he works.	Jo witte hoe't hy wurket.
Life becomes different.	It libben wurdt oars.
She felt she had no one to go to.	Se fielde dat se gjinien hie om nei te gean.
Do not tell him what he thought the first time.	Fertel him net wat er de earste kear tocht.
Of course, he would not.	Fansels, hy soe net.
Otherwise you are better off keeping it.	Oars binne jo better te hâlden.
Your parents will not know it.	Jo âlden sille it net witte.
I can do that now.	Dat kin ik no.
I have waited long enough.	Ik haw lang genôch wachte.
And it got better to do that.	En it waard better om dat te dwaan.
She's all of him.	Se is allegear fan him.
I'm not sure what got into me.	Ik bin der net wis fan wat der yn my kaam.
This was enough for the time being.	Dit wie genôch foar de tiid.
I felt very scared.	Ik fielde my tige bang.
For some reason, we do not believe him.	Om hokker reden, wy leauwe him net.
He did not expect those words.	Hy hie dy wurden net ferwachte.
You'll just be fine.	Jo sille gewoan goed wêze.
I'm the teacher.	Ik bin de learaar.
I did not want to tell her more than she wanted to.	Ik woe har net mear sizze as se woe.
If it does not go so well then they stay away.	As it net sa goed giet dan bliuwe se fuort.
What people do and why.	Wat minsken dogge en wêrom.
It was not easy to read.	It wie net maklik te lêzen.
He did not know what would happen.	Hy wist net wat der barre soe.
She could not ask her friends to come along.	Se koe har freonen net freegje om mei te kommen.
He knew that nothing she could say would make things better.	Hy wist dat neat wat se sizze koe dingen better meitsje soe.
I let it all go.	Ik liet it allegear gean.
You know where it is.	Jo witte wêr't it is.
I know that place.	Ik ken dat plak.
I started reading.	Ik begûn te lêzen.
It's the truth.	It is de wierheid.
Not like it is now.	Net sa as it no is.
Over and over and over.	Oer en oer en oer.
I could make it.	Ik koe it meitsje.
I would not let that happen again.	Ik soe dat net wer barre litte.
You have to get in there.	Jo moatte der yn.
There just isn’t much.	Der is gewoan net folle.
And if they get it.	En as se it krije.
This time it worked.	Dizze kear wurke it.
I know he would say that too	Ik wit dat er dat ek sizze soe
And she wanted more too.	En se woe ek mear.
Se bart no.	Se bart no.
I do know what that can help	Ik wit wol wat dat kin helpe
You have three days to get there.	Jo hawwe trije dagen om dêr te kommen.
Nothing more to do here.	Neat mear te dwaan hjir.
I heard it's happening here	Ik hearde dat it hjir bart
At school she did much better.	Op skoalle die se folle better.
I'm scared of it all.	Ik bin bang fan dit alles.
I was just glad we got a dog	Ik wie gewoan bliid dat wy in hûn krigen
It's right.	It is krekt.
Nice old thing.	Moai âld ding.
He did not know if they were still alive.	Hy wist net oft se noch yn libben wiene.
I need to talk to you	Ik moat mei dy prate
One of those.	Ien fan dy.
They had not met her before.	Se hiene har net earder moete.
We are good then.	Wy binne dan goed.
I feel really good	Ik fiel my hielendal goed
He even knew the man's name.	Hy wist sels de namme fan de man.
I wanted to see what people did tomorrow.	Ik woe sjen wat minsken moarn diene.
Nothing, and never.	Neat, en nea.
I really want you to get help	Ik wol echt dat jo help krije
She wanted to know where he was.	Se woe witte wêr't er wie.
I can handle that	Dêr kin ik wol mei
But that's it.	Mar dat is it sa.
I did not expect anything from that	Dêr hie ik neat fan ferwachte
Whatever you do, do not worry.	Wat jo ek dogge, meitsje jo gjin soargen.
But they must be.	Mar se moatte wêze.
Everyone will make room for you now.	Elkenien sil no plak meitsje foar jo.
She's a city dog.	Se is in stêd hûn.
He was the man of yesterday.	Hy wie de man fan juster.
And the people.	En de minsken.
I just did not realize how late it was	Ik realisearre my gewoan net hoe let it wie
But there is a way.	Mar der is in manier.
You can not have a woman do it for you.	Jo kinne net hawwe dat in frou it foar jo docht.
Just one of these many things is enough, is too much.	Krekt ien fan dizze protte dingen is genôch, is te folle.
I just want to see them.	Ik wol se gewoan sjen.
People want more time or want more money.	Minsken wolle mear tiid of wolle mear jild.
He left after a few days.	Hy gie nei in pear dagen fuort.
I try to be a good person.	Ik besykje in goed persoan te wêzen.
He came up and gave me his hand.	Hy kaam op en joech my syn hân oan.
I had never looked like this before	Ik wie noch nea earder sa nei sjoen
I just want to keep it that way	Ik wol it mar sa hâlde
I'm ready to do it	Ik bin ree om it te dwaan
She came away.	Se kaam fuort.
I knew everything about him	Ik wist alles oer him
It did not work at all for me.	It wurke net hielendal foar my.
They all want you.	Allegear wolle se dy.
They are so easy to make and everyone loves them.	Se binne sa maklik te meitsjen en elkenien hâldt fan har.
I just could not stop.	Ik koe gewoan net ophâlde.
She still did.	Dat die se noch.
You leave it to me.	Jo litte it oan my oer.
That has not been the case over the last year.	Dat is it lêste jier net sa west.
I would do anything for you.	Ik soe alles foar dy dwaan.
I hope he sees this wherever he is	Ik hoopje dat hy dit sjocht wêr't hy ek is
With everything you have.	Mei alles wat jo hawwe.
You know you are happy.	Jo witte dat jo bliid binne.
Someone who would take care of me.	Immen dy't foar my soargje soe.
And, look at me.	En, sjoch my oan.
He must be better than he has ever been before.	Hy moat better wêze as hy ea earder west hat.
Maybe they were, a little.	Miskien wiene se, in bytsje.
I know he would have hurt me	Ik wit hy soe hawwe sear my
We will do everything.	Wy sille alles dwaan.
I had not realized it was this week	Ik hie net realisearre dat it dizze wike wie
But my mother did.	Mar myn mem die.
It was no longer his dog.	It wie syn hûn net mear.
But here you are.	Mar hjir binne jo.
I'm so worried about him	Ik bin sa soargen oer him
I think he should be pretty good.	Ik tink dat hy moai goed wêze moat.
A lot of this comes from.	In protte fan dit komt fan.
A little more time to do what he has to	In bytsje mear tiid om te dwaan wat er moat
That could not be.	Dat koe it net.
I was more worried, than anything	Ik wie mear soargen, as wat dan ek
I would never be free until that happened	Ik soe nea frij wêze oant dat barde
In fact, this is not entirely true.	Eins is dit net hielendal wier.
Maybe it would be nice if you could.	Miskien soe it moai wêze as jo koene.
I would see you.	Ik soe dy sjen.
I would not have been angry	Ik soe net lilk west hawwe
You have to help me.	Jo moatte my helpe.
I already felt bad enough	Ik fielde my al min genôch
I know everything that happens here	Ik wit alles wat hjir bart
Not that it's a bad thing.	Net dat it in minne ding is.
You need to have friends.	Jo moatte freonen hawwe.
There is a good reason for that.	Dêr is in goede reden foar.
It obviously works for me.	It docht fansels foar my.
That's what she should find.	Dat moat se fine.
I want you to wake up	Ik wol dat jo wekker wurde
This is his favorite.	Dizze is syn favorite.
But that was her very.	Mar dat wie se tige.
I did not let her know that	Dat liet ik har net witte
If they do.	As se dogge.
And he would know it.	En hy soe it witte.
That's right, one by one.	Dat is krekt, ien foar ien.
In him they are.	Yn him binne se.
Tell me what you know.	Fertel my wat jo witte.
I wish she had not asked	Ik woe dat se net frege hie
It does not matter who it is.	It makket net út wa't it is.
I can not go back to my father	Ik kin net werom nei myn heit
He was not on his own.	Hy wie net op himsels.
I found some things on him	Ik fûn wat dingen op him
Maybe, if things go well.	Miskien, as dingen goed gean.
I need to see something	Ik moat wat sjen
And it does not matter.	En it makket neat út.
We need to show it, but do not know.	Wy moatte it sjen litte, mar witte it net.
You can do that again.	Dat kinne jo wer dwaan.
We also know who did it.	Wy witte ek wa't it dien hat.
And it will.	En it sil.
He is very clear.	Hy is hiel dúdlik.
He was very much alive	Hy wie tige yn libben
They do not want me to go.	Se wolle net dat ik gean.
I have it here in my book	Ik haw it hjir yn myn boek
She would do nothing.	Se soe neat dwaan.
It just happened on the spot.	It barde gewoan op it plak.
I just talked to her	Ik ha krekt mei har praat
It gets really hard a lot.	It wurdt echt hurd in protte.
I had no way of getting him anything	Ik hie gjin manier om him wat te krijen
Which should be fun.	Wat leuk wêze moat.
I want to talk about you	Ik wol it oer dy hawwe
I should have been scared.	Ik hie bang wêze moatten.
They need to do it right.	Se moatte it goed dwaan.
That's easy money.	Dat is maklik jild.
I thought it would be easy	Ik tocht dat it maklik wêze soe
It's a month late.	It is in moanne te let.
I hope you know that	Ik hoopje dat jo dat witte
That's fine now.	Dat is no goed.
They never found one.	Se hawwe noait ien fûn.
I think we are different	Ik tink dat wy oars binne
Many of us were like that	In protte fan ús wiene sa
I would really like that.	Ik soe graach dat eins.
It all went very well though.	It gie allegear wol hiel goed.
I'm not really there yet.	Ik noch net echt.
But he did hear from her once more.	Mar hy hearde wol noch ien kear fan har.
He would like to go, and then again he would like to stay.	Hy soe graach gean, en dan wer soe er graach bliuwe.
Of course, nothing came out.	Der kaam fansels neat út.
She did not walk.	Se rûn net.
But this is old book.	Mar dit is âld boek.
I really did not want to see him	Ik woe him eins net sjen
Here, come in.	Hjir, kom yn.
They had seen them both.	Se hiene har beide sjoen.
I did not know my father	Ik koe myn heit net
That has always been the case.	Dat is altyd sa west.
I would take one of them.	Ik soe der ien fan nimme.
And that is after only one day.	En dat is nei mar ien dei.
I'm so sorry, not really	It spyt my sa, net echt
I would not leave it.	Ik soe it net litte.
I saw the police there	Ik seach dêr de plysje
I did not want my mother to find her	Ik woe net dat myn mem har fûn
I want you to take care of them	Ik wol dat jo foar har soargje
And she needs you and loves you.	En se hat jo nedich en hâldt fan dy.
I know this will probably not happen again	Ik wit dat dit wierskynlik net wer barre sil
But she was now ready to talk.	Mar se wie no klear om te praten.
It was with his mother.	It wie by syn mem.
More I did not want to know	Mear woe ik net witte
I did not want to see this	Ik woe dit net sjen
I think so too.	Ik tink it ek.
They would not get in there.	Se soene der net yn komme.
I've been so wrong	Ik haw sa ferkeard west
I wanted to leave, but he did not let me	Ik woe fuort, mar hy liet my net
It's her word against his.	It is har wurd tsjin syn.
I'll be here	Ik sil hjir wêze
If you do, there's the door.	As jo ​​dat dogge, is d'r de doar.
I did not think you were actually hurt	Ik tocht net dat jo eins sear wiene
He does not want that life.	Hy wol dat libben net.
But let's make the best of it.	Mar litte wy der it bêste fan meitsje.
But the room was not so nice.	Mar de keamer wie net sa moai.
I thought everyone was gone	Ik tocht dat elkenien fuort wie
I did not have to tell anyone	Ik hoegde it net oan immen te fertellen
Soon they would be seen.	Al gau soene se sjoen wurde.
There was no way to tell.	Der wie gjin manier om te fertellen.
Nobody liked to go to bed.	Nimmen mocht graach op bêd gean.
It looks at us.	It sjocht nei ús.
I was told you might be able to help	Ik waard ferteld dat jo miskien helpe kinne
I could tell it was them.	Ik koe sizze dat it se wiene.
I'm not so sure now.	Ik bin der no net sa wis fan.
You were just.	Jo wiene gewoan.
I've been to her house	Ik haw by har hûs west
It's just what it is.	It is gewoan wat it is.
Two by two by two.	Twa by twa by twa.
I wondered if it would ever stop	Ik frege my ôf oft it oait ophâlde soe
We have to.	Wy moatte.
I wonder where we are	Ik freegje my ôf wêr't wy binne
Both for the same reason.	Beide foar deselde reden.
There was still much more to do for her.	Der wie noch folle mear foar har te dwaan.
But you really have to come with us.	Mar jo moatte echt mei ús komme.
I went back to the car	Ik gie werom nei de auto
You and me, we are the same.	Jo en my, wy binne itselde.
I know he was not.	Ik wit dat hy net wie.
It's what we are.	It is wat wy binne.
I could be good to her now.	Ik koe no goed foar har wêze.
Are the same.	Binne itselde.
That's what it's about.	Dêr moat it oer gean.
It's totally good.	It is hielendal goed.
He did not say where we were going.	Hy sei net wêr't wy hinne soene.
And of course, when they did, the baby was fine.	En fansels, doe't se diene, wie it bern goed.
I just know where you are	Ik wit gewoan wêr't jo binne
He wanted to know why they were so late.	Hy woe witte wêrom't se sa let wiene.
People will come to see.	Minsken sille komme om te sjen.
It's the same for talking.	It is itselde foar praten.
I did not even see you	Ik seach dy net iens
As if he.	As soe hy.
I'm almost sure it can not	Ik bin der hast wis fan dat it net kin
He's just scared.	Hy is net bang.
I never want to know	Ik wol it noait witte
I just had to stay out of it	Ik hie der mar út moatte bliuwe
If you know anyone, please tell me.	As jo ​​ien witte, fertel it my asjebleaft.
I should.	Ik soe.
I've never even seen him.	Ik haw him sels noait sjoen.
But, they pay out.	Mar, se betelje út.
But it never works.	Mar it wurket noait.
Or even not.	Of sels dat net.
And it's time.	En it is tiid.
We talk for a long time.	Wy prate lang.
I'm really looking forward to this one	Ik sjoch echt út nei dizze
I know that will take time	Ik wit dat dat tiid sil nimme
On the same thing.	Op itselde ding.
I just let him go	Ik liet him der mar oan
She knew exactly what to do.	Se wist krekt wat te dwaan.
I knew she would not be forever	Ik wist dat se net foar altyd wêze soe
I was not sure what to do next	Ik wie der net wis fan wat ik no dwaan moast
That's a good thing.	Dat is in goed ding.
We know that and he must be.	Wy witte dat en hy moat wêze.
I'll be up soon, very soon	Ik sil gau op wêze, heul gau
They hope she went home with someone.	Se hoopje dat se mei ien nei hûs gie.
I just wish it was not that long	Ik woe gewoan dat it net sa lang wie
Well, we all know what happened.	No, wy witte allegear wat der bard is.
I also realized something else	Ik realisearre ek wat oars
I made him work for it	Ik makke him wurk foar it
I wonder if they do that now.	Ik freegje my ôf oft se dat no dogge.
I think it was a man	Ik tink dat it in man wie
I'm not sure yet.	Ik bin der noch net wis fan.
That's what we need to find to help your wife.	Dat is wat wy moatte fine om jo frou te helpen.
Then eat it.	Dan ite it.
I was so out of here.	Ik wie hjir sa út.
He can see it, but he can not get it right.	Hy kin it sjen, mar hy kin it net krekt krije.
I found out they were no longer there	Ik fûn út dat se der net mear wiene
It just comes up, is the thing.	It komt gewoan op, is it ding.
I knew it was time to dump her and move on	Ik wist dat it tiid wie om fuort te gean
It's the best !.	It is de bêste!.
And that is not clear.	En dat is net dúdlik.
That does not matter.	Dat makket neat út.
I love that guy	Ik hâld fan dy keardel
They do not like it.	Se fine it net goed.
It seems good to me.	It liket my goed.
I'm doing it hard.	Ik doch it dreech.
I only want the best for her too	Ik wol allinnich it bêste foar har ek
I think it works.	Ik tink dat it wurket.
I felt at home there	Ik fielde my dêr as thús
It just seems like something so real.	It liket krekt as wat sa echt.
He should have known.	Hy hie it witte moatten.
I don 't even think he knew that.	Ik tink net iens dat er dat wist.
I have to tell the police about that.	Dêr moat ik de plysje oer fertelle.
I doubt they will ever be.	Ik twifelje dat se ea sille wêze.
One goes in.	Ien giet yn.
Make food in a different way.	Meitsje iten op in oare manier.
I want to get out of here	Ik wol hjir wei
What do you think we should do ?.	Wat fine jo dat wy moatte dwaan?.
They say it and everything.	Se sizze it en alles.
I would love to see you again, he said.	Ik soe dy hiel graach wer sjen, sei er.
I met him once, a very long time ago	Ik moete him ien kear, in hiel lang lyn
This was not a family at first.	Dit wie earst gjin famylje.
You have to make a living.	Jo moatte meitsje in libben.
I have found this to be true.	Ik haw fûn dat dit wier is.
Maybe it would help.	Miskien soe it helpe.
We do not know what it was.	Wy witte net wat it wie.
He did great things.	Hy die grutte dingen.
These two had that.	Dizze twa hiene dat.
There, the making of the film began	Dêr begûn it meitsjen fan de film
I can see it here myself	Ik kin it hjir sels sjen
You may have heard of it.	Jo hawwe miskien heard oer it.
I asked her if she was gone	Ik frege har oft se fuort wie
I do not think she is.	Ik tink net dat se dat is.
I told him all about you	Ik fertelde him alles oer dy
They are without hope.	Se binne sûnder hope.
But it's good.	Mar it is goed.
I love it though.	Ik hâld der wol fan.
And it must be so here.	En it moat hjir sa wêze.
It was not enough.	It wie net genôch.
I just let it happen	Ik lit it mar barre
I was back, you know, back, but different	Ik wie werom, jo ​​witte, werom, mar oars
No talking yet.	Noch gjin praat.
I did not like that a bit	Dat fûn ik net in bytsje leuk
That has to happen.	Dat moat barre.
I have to make things right	Ik moat dingen goed meitsje
I was not sure what she was doing now	Ik wist net wis wat se no die
Nobody needs you here.	Nimmen hat jo hjir nedich.
I wonder if you would help me with anything.	Ik freegje my ôf oft jo my mei wat helpe soene.
And if you do not do it yourself.	En as jo sels net dogge.
I actually hadn’t thought at all	Ik hie eins hielendal net tocht
What else do you need ?.	Wat hawwe jo noch nedich?.
It was good to be back there again.	It wie goed om der wer werom te wêzen.
I know who you are, and this is not your talk	Ik wit wa't jo binne, en dit is net jo praten
It was his first book	It wie syn earste boek
Give him time.	Jou him tiid.
I want to know if it works	Ik wol witte oft it wurket
I want to help you	Ik wol dy helpe
Children need to get ready for school.	Bern moatte har klear meitsje foar skoalle.
I have to, otherwise he's late for work	Ik moat wol, oars komt er te let op it wurk
I really hope he can help me	Ik hoopje echt dat hy my kin helpe
I tried to be good	Ik besocht goed te wêzen
But he does not want to stay.	Mar hy wol net bliuwe.
I was a good guy.	Ik wie in goede keardel.
I let him hold me.	Ik lit him my hâlde.
She had come back.	Se wie werom kommen.
I still do not.	Ik noch altyd net.
I could not pay it	Ik koe it net betelje
And he gets along well with her.	En hy komt goed mei har oer.
I expected problems	Ik ferwachte problemen
Maybe for the girl it was.	Miskien foar it famke wie it.
I can not wait until tomorrow	Ik kin net wachtsje oant moarn
I did not make him do it	Ik makke him it net dwaan
I did not know that about him	Dat wist ik net fan him
We're in place.	Wy binne op it plak.
Holds a lot.	Hâld in protte.
Many were already gone.	In protte wiene al fuort.
They are not such a thing.	Se binne net sa'n ding.
I was once him and he would soon be me.	Ik wie ea him en hy soe gau wêze my.
But people do not seem to do that.	Mar minsken lykje dat net te dwaan.
They just keep talking.	Se geane gewoan troch te praten.
He does not see that.	Dat sjocht er net.
I did not ask what happened	Ik frege net wat der barde
But there was no one to see him.	Mar der wie gjinien om him te sjen.
That could not be it.	Dat koe it net wêze.
That was about two weeks ago.	Dat wie sa'n twa wike lyn.
I really thought he died.	Ik tocht echt dat hy stoar.
But nothing had gone well.	Mar neat wie goed gien.
See, if you really want to do it, you can.	Sjoch, as jo it echt dwaan wolle, kinne jo.
I shake his hand.	Ik jou him de hân.
She needs your help now.	Se hat jo help no nedich.
That's exactly what we all do.	Dat is krekt wat wy allegear dogge.
And we had no idea.	En wy hiene gjin idee.
You always wish there was someone else.	Jo winskje altyd dat der noch ien wie.
I wanted you to know what's going on	Ik woe dat jo witte wat der bart
But she also said other things.	Mar se sei ek oare dingen.
My questions to my dr.	Myn fragen oan myn dr.
I just want to get on with it	Ik wol der mar op
Nobody needs to know.	Nimmen moat it witte.
I will not hurt your mother so much	Ik sil dyn mem net sa sear dwaan
I thought back to what he said	Ik tocht werom oan wat er sei
Can't do anything.	Kin neat oan.
It can talk now.	It kin no prate.
Mom knows nothing about money.	Mem wit neat fan jild.
I can see that happening	Ik kin sjen dat barre
I do not have to say it is a house	Ik moat net sizze dat it in hûs is
Please try to do the same.	Besykje asjebleaft itselde te dwaan.
I knew what they were going to do	Ik wist wat se soene dwaan
I'm glad you made it	Ik bin bliid dat jo it makke hawwe
Just do these things.	Doch dizze dingen gewoan.
First, do not record anything else.	Earst, net wat oars op te nimmen.
I can not be.	Ik kin net wêze.
I would have to eat before the week was over	Ik soe moatte ite foardat de wike wie om
But he had done nothing.	Mar hy hie neat dien.
What about .	Wat oer .
I just do not want that.	Dit wol se ek net.
But none of this is enough.	Mar neat fan dit is genôch.
I feel good about her	Ik fiel my wol mei har
Do not worry me now.	Meitsje my no gjin soargen.
They still do.	Se dogge it noch.
This is not a chance.	Dit is gjin kâns.
I would like to know what happened in the last.	Ik wol graach witte wat der yn de lêste barde.
You have one.	En har man.
I did not expect that	Dat hie ik net ferwachte
I thought it would never stop.	Ik tocht dat it soe nea ophâlde.
We have to.	Wy moatte .
I just did not like that everyone knew it	Ik mocht gewoan net dat elkenien it wist
I really had nothing to do	Ik hie eins neat te dwaan
This should not happen.	Dit mocht net barre.
He's still there.	Hy is der noch.
I want to become a teacher.	Ik wol learaar wurde.
I hope he's not scared	Ik hoopje dat er net bang is
This is beautiful.	Dit is moai.
That was after.	Dat wie nei.
I kind of did.	Ik soarte fan dien.
I think, this is the problem.	Ik tink, dit is it probleem.
You know this now.	Jo witte dit no.
There must have been something different.	Der fielde wol wat oars.
Every day there had been something.	Alle dagen hie der wat west.
And remember my words.	En tink oan myn wurden.
But it didn't really matter, she thought.	Mar it hoegde net echt, tocht se.
Please remember what you are saying.	Tink asjebleaft oan wat jo sizze.
I do what he wants	Ik doch wat hy wol
I just thought of him	Ik tocht krekt oan him
I saw the same thing an hour ago	Ik seach itselde ding in oere lyn
I think it was now two years ago.	Ik tink dat it no twa jier lyn wie.
I hope there is one	Ik hoopje dat d'r ien is
And the dog would see it.	En de hûn soe it sjen.
Everyone is happy again.	Elkenien is wer bliid.
They will be waiting for us.	Se sille op ús wachtsje.
I wondered what she saw.	Ik frege my ôf wat se seach.
In a way it did.	Op in manier die it.
They find it there.	Se fine it dêr.
I hope she comes.	Ik hoopje dat se komt.
And so you want it to be clear.	En sa wolle jo dat it dúdlik is.
It can all be done.	It kin allegear dien wurde.
She just wanted to see you.	Se woe gewoan dy sjen.
We are not there yet.	Wy binne der noch net.
They were not children.	Se wiene gjin bern.
You have to give what you have.	Jo moatte jaan wat jo hawwe.
There is something to this.	Der is wat oan dit.
I did not tell him everything	Ik haw him net alles ferteld
I looked at the reason why it happens that way.	Ik seach nei de reden wêrom't it sa bart.
I can not see.	Ik kin net sjen.
I can not know today	Ik kin it hjoed net witte
I would very much like to see you	Ik soe dy tige graach sjen wolle
I can help you if you need anything	Ik kin jo helpe as jo wat nedich binne
Just look at it.	Sjoch der mar yn.
Do not know where the problem is.	Wit net wêr't it probleem is.
There's nothing for you.	D'r is neat foar jo.
Said he was.	Sei hy wie.
There is nothing to see.	Dêr is neat te sjen.
We knew why he was so angry.	Wy wisten wêrom't er sa lilk wie.
I think it's my way	Ik tink dat it myn manier is
Right through, he thought.	Krekt troch, tocht er.
I never take anything other than food.	Ik nim noait wat oars as iten.
I feel better about it now.	Ik fiel my der no better oer.
I can see that you're angry at me.	Ik kin sjen datst lilk op my bist.
You know things.	Jo witte dingen.
I was in bed all morning	Ik wie de hiele moarn op bêd
I should not have asked you now	Ik hie dy no net freegje moatten
I was not allowed to talk about it.	Ik mocht der net oer prate.
I do not completely agree	Ik bin it net hielendal iens
But it's too ordinary of a place.	Mar it is te gewoan fan in plak.
They must have food.	Se moatte iten hawwe.
That, of course, will not be necessary.	Dat sil fansels net nedich wêze.
You have not seen them much.	Jo hawwe se net in protte sjoen.
I do not like to be scared.	Ik hâld der net fan om bang te wêzen.
Do not hurt a little.	Doch net in bytsje sear.
I did not always want children	Ik woe net altyd bern
I love money.	Ik hâld fan jild.
I'm asking if he still has anything	Ik freegje oft er noch wat hat
And that can not be good.	En dat kin net goed.
Everyone was very happy with the food.	Elkenien wie tige bliid mei it iten.
He had a whole life.	Hy hie in hiel libben.
I wish someone would help me, or like me	Ik winskje immen soe helpe my, of like my
What could happen.	Wat koe der barre.
I hope she's not home now	Ik hoopje dat se no net thús is
I never do that.	Dat doch ik noait.
We are not just talking about the hand.	Wy prate net gewoan oer de hân.
I just feel so alone	Ik fiel my gewoan sa allinnich
I can not believe it has been a month	Ik kin net leauwe dat it al in moanne west hat
I want to help you	Ik wol dy helpe
I want it all, kids	Ik wol it allegear, bern
Nobody cares much, but he has to be careful.	Nimmen folle om, mar hy moat foarsichtich wêze.
He told me to do it one more time.	Hy fertelde my om it noch ien kear te dwaan.
I was not his problem, but he made me his problem	Ik wie net syn probleem, mar hy makke my syn probleem
Everything you think is true.	Alles wat jo tinke is wier.
I just wanted to free her.	Ik woe har allinnich frij.
I came to tell him that.	Ik bin kommen om him dat te fertellen.
I did that for another year, once a week	Ik die dat noch in jier, ien kear yn 'e wike
I thought she might be thinking of leaving	Ik tocht dat se miskien wol tinke om fuort te gean
I think it was clear	Ik tink dat it dúdlik wie
But we must not be.	Mar wy moatte net wêze.
I could not think of that again	Dêr koe ik net wer oan tinke
Well, it happens again.	No, it bart wer.
I'm not exactly sure how long	Ik bin net krekt wis hoe lang
I wanted to try it for once.	Ik woe it foar ien kear besykje.
I think people have always been people	Ik tink dat minsken altyd minsken west hawwe
Just visit me, and let's see where it comes from.	Besykje my gewoan, en lit sjen wêr't it komt.
I have my people to worry about.	Ik haw myn minsken om soargen te meitsjen.
He says he will take them tomorrow.	Hy seit dat er se moarn nimme sil.
I can see what he would see in you	Ik kin sjen wat hy soe sjen yn dy
You know what will happen if you do not.	Jo witte wat der barre sil as jo dat net dogge.
I believe he's still in his office	Ik leau dat er noch yn syn kantoar is
It's beautiful here.	It is hjir moai.
Will be able to get you.	Sille jo kinne krije jo.
And that was not good enough.	En dat wie net goed genôch.
And then they just let it go.	En dan litte se it mar litte.
It's nothing real.	It is neat echt.
Life was good.	It libben wie goed.
I'm not too worried about that	Ik bin der net al te drok oer
You can do anything with your life.	Jo kinne alles dwaan mei jo libben.
We can not stay here either.	Wy kinne hjir ek net bliuwe.
It seems like a lifetime.	It liket in libben lang.
The two decided it was time to leave.	De twa besletten dat it tiid wie om fuort te gean.
I thought it was my mother	Ik tocht dat it myn mem wie
I can say nothing	Ik kin neat sizze
I am a man and a father	Ik bin in man en in heit
We have everything here.	Wy hawwe hjir alles.
What he would do.	Wat hy soe dwaan.
And there she can stay.	En dêr kin se bliuwe.
I've done this before, at home.	Ik haw dit earder dien, thús.
Maybe no friends.	Miskien gjin freonen.
Or was she once.	Of wie se eartiids.
I wonder if they got the idea from the movie.	Ik freegje my ôf oft se it idee krigen hawwe fan 'e film.
So it seems.	Sa liket it derop.
I just could not give her what she wanted	Ik koe har gewoan net jaan wat se woe
I took more.	Ik naam mear.
But we had each other.	Mar wy hiene elkoar.
I would be ready.	Ik soe klear wêze.
I thought you might like them	Ik tocht dat jo se leuk fine kinne
If you do not have it, you want to have it really bad.	As jo ​​​​it net hawwe, wolle jo it echt min hawwe.
An office for talking.	In kantoar foar praten.
I want to talk to you both	Ik wol mei dy beide prate
But you are my last hope.	Mar do bist myn lêste hope.
I had waited until it came.	Ik hie wachte oant it kaam.
That she did not just walk.	Dat se net gewoan rûn.
He was also not the only one who was worried.	Hy wie ek net de iennichste dy't soargen wie.
I made her work it myself.	Ik makke har wurk it sels.
She will never have what she wants.	Se sil noait hawwe wat se wol.
That was over.	Dat wie oer.
Not very angry.	Net gau lilk.
I should not have gone	Ik hie net gean moatten
He the, and in what way.	Hy die, en op hokker manier.
This is the truth.	Dit is de wierheid.
That's what he said.	Dat sei er.
It was like something in a book.	It wie as wat yn in boek.
Now she was not so sure.	No wie se net sa wis.
You never knew he was there.	Jo wisten noait dat hy der wie.
I doubt it, but maybe	Ik twifelje der oan, mar miskien
It's your life.	It is dyn libben.
I had to be with her	Ik moast by har wêze
Do not doubt me here.	Twifelje my hjir net oan.
But the questions keep coming.	Mar de fragen bliuwe komme.
It does not matter, there is enough time.	It makket neat út, der is genôch tiid.
I asked her where they would stay	Ik frege har wêr't se bliuwe sille
Angry, but not a little surprised.	Lilk, mar net in bytsje ferrast.
But if it is not.	Mar as it net is.
A favorite teacher.	In favorite learaar.
I should not talk about it.	Ik soe der net oer prate moatte.
They would come if they could.	Se soene komme as se koene.
All new friends are few friends.	Alle nije freonen binne pear freonen.
I'm interested in you	Ik bin ynteressearre yn dy
I want to be very clear, here	Ik wol hiel dúdlik wêze, hjir
This should take a bit of a toll.	Dit moat in bytsje fan 'e wei nimme.
We were too late.	Wy wiene te let.
I knew it had no chance at home	Ik wist dat it thús gjin kâns hie
I wondered how he would handle it	Ik frege my ôf hoe't hy it oan soe
I just wanted to make sure you were not with him	Ik woe gewoan soargje dat jo net by him wiene
And it would.	En it soe.
But this is not the place for it.	Mar dit is net it plak foar it.
They will want to know where you have been.	Se sille wol witte wêr't jo west hawwe.
I really like it here	Ik hâld der echt fan hjir
If it's my life exactly.	As it is myn libben krekt.
I see it all the time	Ik sjoch it de hiele tiid
I think he had something on hand	Ik tink dat hy wat oan 'e hân wie
I was not sure if you had been here before	Ik wie der net wis fan oft jo hjir earder west hiene
I thought about the house	Ik tocht oer it hûs
I looked at the picture for a long time.	Ik seach lang nei de foto.
I really wonder what will happen then.	Ik freegje my echt ôf wat der dan barre sil.
I just did not expect it so soon.	Ik hie it gewoan net sa gau ferwachte.
I know what you're up to	Ik wit wat jo fan plan binne
I have to give you this	Ik moat dy dit jaan
You are too beautiful to not have what you want.	Jo binne te moai om net te hawwen wat jo wolle.
Not really for her, but for us.	Net echt foar har, mar foar ús.
The problem was not there.	It probleem wie der net.
It may be for you, too.	It kin wêze foar dy, te.
I did not wait that long this time	Ik wachte dizze kear net sa lang
But no one comes for me.	Mar nimmen komt foar my.
Either way, you win.	Hoe dan ek, jo winne.
she says.	seit se.
I did not come to do it	Ik kaam der net om om it te dwaan
I want you here with me	ik wol dy hjir by my
You're buying a new car.	Jo keapje in nije auto.
Whether it is good or bad.	Oft it goed of min is.
Still, they have it all.	Noch altyd hawwe se alles.
I was the only person there	Ik wie de ienige persoan dêr
I worked really hard for her	Ik wurke echt hurd foar har
Not one of us is.	Net ien fan ús is.
I had no one to help me	Ik hie gjinien om my te helpen
I can say nothing more than that	Ik kin neat mear sizze as dat
I'll take care of her.	Ik sil har soargje.
I just can not see her like that.	Ik kin har gewoan net sa sjen.
It's out there.	It is der út.
I could not say what it was	Ik koe net sizze hokker it wie
I felt like such a girl	Ik fielde my sa'n famke
Whoever said this was more than accurate.	Wa't dit sei, wie mear as krekt.
I could not speak in the right way	Ik koe net op 'e goede manier prate
Either way, come out if you want.	Hoe dan ek, kom út as jo wolle.
I'm glad you're here!	Ik bin bliid dat jo hjir binne!
I had been there before and done so	Ik hie der earder west en dat dien
Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have.	Miskien seach er wat dat er net ha moast.
I did not feel well	Ik haw it net goed hân
I can say nothing.	Ik kin neat sizze.
There are two problems with this.	D'r binne twa problemen mei dit.
I can not stand it anymore	Ik kin it net mear oan
It just bothered me.	It die my allinnich mar oan.
I'm looking forward to it	Ik sjoch der sa nei út
I do what is expected of me	Ik doch wat fan my ferwachte wurdt
But someone has to do it.	Mar immen moat it dwaan.
Even now he was not really sure why.	Ek no wie er net echt wis wêrom.
But this one was different.	Mar dizze wie oars.
It's not pretty.	It is net moai.
I'm fine with that.	Ik bin der goed mei.
But, he has a big family.	Mar, hy hat in grutte famylje.
It already looks good.	It sjocht der al goed út.
There was enough here, and soon he would have more.	Der wie hjir genôch, en al gau soe er mear hawwe.
She thought he might not have even realized it.	Se tocht dat er it miskien net iens realisearre hie.
You still have to get there.	Jo moatte der noch komme.
I was so happy that I was asked.	Ik wie sa bliid dat ik frege waard.
I never want to see her again	Ik wol har noait wer sjen
I could see now that it was a woman	Ik koe no sjen dat it in frou wie
I've had enough of that.	Dêr haw ik genôch fan.
I was not sure	Ik wie der net wis fan
I assume you have one	Ik nim oan dat jo ien hawwe
Well, if you have to go away.	No, as jo fuort moatte gean.
It bothers me.	It makket my út.
Well, he said nothing.	No, hy sei neat.
Too busy for their problems.	Te drok foar har problemen.
I have been so tired of work, family and life	Ik haw sa wurch west fan wurk, famylje en libben
I did not hear in her life	Ik hearde net yn har libben
I asked her to stay with me	Ik frege har by my te bliuwen
I will not do this again.	Ik sil dit net mear dwaan.
I have to be, to become.	Ik moat wêze, om te wurden.
He knew who it was.	Hy wist wa't it wie.
This is not a good place to be.	Dit is gjin goed plak om te wêzen.
I know you're very busy	Ik wit dat jo it tige drok hawwe
Let's go.	Lit mar gean.
I'm here, now with you	Ik bin hjir, no by dy
I did not know you knew him	Ik wist net dat jo him koene
It's the truth.	It is de wierheid.
But she says nothing.	Mar se seit neat.
That's what I should say to you	Dat soe ik tsjin dy sizze moatte
My kind, or his kind.	Myn soarte, of syn soarte.
It's the name.	It is de namme.
He has enough to deal with.	Hy hat genôch om mei te dwaan.
I only came here for one reason	Ik kaam hjir mar foar ien reden
The other did it.	De oare hat se dien.
He did not want anyone.	Hy woe gjinien.
A lot needs to be done.	Der moat in protte dien wurde.
I love her very much	Ik hâld fan har tige
I just need to know what it is	Ik moat gewoan witte wat it is
The problem is, they do.	It probleem is, se dogge.
I've never tried it before.	Ik haw it noch noait besocht.
I can not, for some reason	Ik kin net, om ien of oare reden
So you can buy it.	Sa kinne jo keapje it.
I have no problem spending all my money	Ik haw gjin probleem om al myn jild út te jaan
never to read the book.	noait om it boek te lêzen.
I did not think of that	Dêr tocht ik net oan
I know she'll be out soon	Ik wit dat se gau út sil
An easy read.	In maklik lêzen.
I wanted to talk to you about tonight	Ik woe mei dy prate oer fannacht
I know of the whole thing.	Ik wit fan it hiele ding.
Her parents help her in whatever she can.	Har âlden helpe har yn wat se kinne.
I never met him.	Ik haw him nea moete.
Take the money.	Nim it jild.
It will not be my first time.	It sil myn earste kear net wêze.
But the question remained.	Mar de fraach bleau.
She was not ready for it.	Se wie der net klear foar.
She's three times too late.	Se is trije kear te let op.
She knows we did.	Se wit dat wy dien hawwe.
I have something to do last night	Ik haw fannacht wat te dwaan
I wondered where all this was going	Ik frege my ôf wêr't dit alles hinne gie
Try it today.	Besykje it hjoed.
I realized her plan, but it was too late	Ik realisearre har plan, mar it wie te let
It's only for two months.	It is mar foar twa moanne.
Must make you beautiful first.	Moat dy earst moai meitsje.
I have to make it that way	Ik moat it sa meitsje
What happens then.	Wat bart der dan.
I can 't take it anymore	Ik kin der net mear mei
I assume this is also true in life	Ik nim oan dat dit ek wier is yn it libben
It doesn 't matter who you put around that guy.	It makket neat út wa't jo om dy keardel sette.
So he had read my book.	Sa hie er myn boek lêzen.
Nobody cares.	Nimmen hat it dreech.
I also did not want to tell anyone about it.	Ik woe der ek gjinien oer fertelle.
I tried to talk him out of it.	Ik besocht him der út te praten.
This I should have done days ago.	Dit hie ik dagen lyn dien moatten.
I'll talk to him this morning	Ik praat mei him fan 'e moarn
I was under the girl.	Ik wie ûnder it famke.
He was not sure what to do.	Hy wie der net wis fan wat te dwaan.
Maybe time needed something else.	Miskien hie de tiid wat oars nedich.
I knew it had to be	Ik wist dat it wêze moast
I was not.	Ik wie it net.
Doing so is fairly easy.	Dat dwaan is frij maklik.
Or it would.	Of it soe.
This is not a problem anymore.	Dit is gjin probleem mear.
We can not do that.	Dat kinne wy ​​net dwaan.
I wanted it, needed it myself	Ik hie it wol, hie it sels nedich
They just do not know who wants that.	Se witte gewoan net wa't dat wol.
For a long time he said nothing.	Lang sei er neat.
She knew what she wanted.	Se wist wat se woe.
I had to do something.	Ik moast wat dwaan.
She's fine now.	Se is no goed.
I think she did just that	Ik tink dat se dat krekt makke hat
That you know that's the reason.	Dat jo witte dat d'r de reden is.
She must have done it forever.	Se moat it foar altyd dien hawwe.
I should have told you that before, but here it comes.	Ik hie it dy earder fertelle moatten, mar hjir komt it.
I just saw it happen	Ik seach it krekt barre
I've seen you for a long time	Ik haw dy al lang sjoen
I have not had one for almost three years	Ik haw al hast trije jier gjin ien hân
I know that's what you're told me	Ik wit dat is wat jo ferteld binne
A man who loves food, and who showed it	In man dy't fan iten hâlde, en dy't it sjen liet
I know my way back here	Ik wit myn wei hjir werom
I would hold them back	Ik soe hâld se werom
I'm so sorry.	It spyt my sa sa sa.
She told me she would not tell you about it.	Se fertelde my dat se jo der net oer fertelle soe.
I can not believe he did not come to our house.	Ik kin net leauwe dat er net by ús thús kaam is.
Not a bad way, he thought.	Net in minne wei, tocht er.
Here and now.	Hjir en no.
I want to do it all with you	Ik wol it allegear mei dy dwaan
But he did not do any of those things.	Mar hy die net ien fan dy dingen.
No one knew where it was.	Nimmen wist wêr't it wie.
And you have to do the same.	En jo moatte itselde dwaan.
I have to get away from you	Ik moat by dy wei
They will believe it has been a good time.	Se sille leauwe dat it in goede tiid west hat.
Tell me that.	Fertel my dat mar.
I wondered why that was	Ik frege my ôf wêrom dat wie
A few things, actually	In pear dingen, eins
She's having a party.	Se hâldt in feest.
They acted like sick all the time.	Se diene de hiele tiid as siik wiene.
We have these.	Wy hawwe dizze.
It's coming back to her now.	It komt har no werom.
All this.	Dit alles.
He loves no one.	Hy hâldt fan gjinien.
But he already knew who was there.	Mar hy wist al wa't der wie.
I still have a lot of things to tell	Ik haw noch in protte dingen te fertellen
I'll leave you now, until tomorrow.	Ik sil dy no litte, oant moarn.
But he did not find it.	Mar hy fûn it net.
Do not touch any of us.	Rekke net op neat fan ús.
I would not hurt anyone	Ik soe gjinien sear dwaan
But nothing good ever comes out of taking.	Mar neat goed komt ea út nimme.
I woke up early and wanted to do something	Ik waard betiid wekker en woe wat dwaan
And you found me.	En do hast my fûn.
These are them here.	Dit binne se hjir.
I did this not just for myself	Ik haw dit net allinnich foar my dien
They knew what they were talking about.	Se wisten wêr't se oer wiene.
I wonder what she knows even more.	Ik freegje my ôf wat se noch mear wit.
Father, you heard nothing.	Heit, do hearde neat.
You are, or you are not.	Jo binne, of jo binne net.

There was something not quite right about all this.	Der wie wat net hielendal goed oer dit alles.
I could tell he was scared	Ik koe fertelle hy wie bang
I had so much to do yesterday	Ik hie juster safolle te dwaan
I do not let them get sick	Ik lit har net siik meitsje
I can live with that.	Ik kin hjir wol oan wenne.
Whatever it is you want.	Wat it ek is dat jo wolle.
It was good to see them.	It wie goed om se te sjen.
I never had anything to do with it.	Dêr hie ik noait wat mei te krijen.
No idea at all.	Gjin idee hielendal.
But for us, it's just the man and the children.	Mar foar ús binne it gewoan de man en de bern.
Nothing has been given to him.	Der is neat oan him jûn.
They could do anything.	Se koene alles dwaan.
I was not even sure it was there.	Ik wist net iens wis dat it der wie.
So far so good.	Oant no ta wie hjoed goed.
There was more food, more hope.	Der wie mear iten, mear hope.
Do not sign up.	Meitsje jo net oan.
Then he comes back.	Dan komt er werom.
You did this.	Jo hawwe dit dien.
I could not help it	Ik koe it net helpe
These three are what they do.	Dizze trije binne it wat se dogge.
I had very good help	Ik hie heul goede help
She is now.	Se is no.
I'm not one to say that this either works or does not work.	Ik bin net ien om te sizzen dat dit of wurket of net wurket.
Had to have this again today.	Moast dit hjoed wer hawwe.
What do you want to talk about this problem ?.	Wat wolle jo prate oer dit probleem?.
I was not at all happy with it	Ik wie der hielendal net bliid mei
She would never know.	Se soe it noait witte.
They were probably too busy.	Se wiene wierskynlik te drok.
No one has ever had the chance to do that.	Nimmen hat oait de kâns om dat te dwaan.
We did not talk about it.	Wy hiene it der net oer.
A man arrived	Der kaam in man oan
Please help me for the same.	Help my asjebleaft foar itselde.
Here is no place for us anymore.	Hjir is gjin plak mear foar ús.
She told me about you hurting me.	Se fertelde my oer dy te sear my.
Maybe the child told the truth.	Miskien fertelde it bern de wierheid.
I had not thought of that before	Dêr hie ik noch net earder oan tocht
I was not sure what, but it was real.	Ik wie net wis wat, mar it wie echt.
And the food.	En it iten.
Well, a lot of things.	No, in protte dingen.
I had school and friends to take my time with.	Ik hie skoalle en freonen om myn tiid yn te nimmen.
Will say nothing.	Sil neat sizze.
It's not just about tonight.	It giet net allinnich om fannacht.
She is ready on day one.	Se is klear op dei ien.
But to the children.	Mar nei de bern.
I probably did not have to tell you that	Dat hoegde ik dy wierskynlik net te fertellen
But it made out.	Mar it makke út.
Life is good, my friends.	It libben is goed, myn freonen.
Please show me.	Lit my asjebleaft sjen.
I'm looking forward to it	Ik sjoch der sa út nei
It's not an easy life.	It is gjin maklik libben.
I wanted more time with you	Ik woe mear tiid mei dy
They love him.	Se hâlde fan him.
I have no problem with that, good for you	Ik haw gjin probleem mei dat, goed foar dy
I'm not made for this	Ik bin net makke foar dit
I had heard of her place before.	Ik hie earder fan har plak heard.
They must have.	Se moatte hawwe.
They probably need the money.	Se hawwe wierskynlik it jild nedich.
I think they were the only two you knew.	Ik tink dat se de ienige twa wiene dy't jo wisten.
Be prepared to be surprised.	Wês ree om ferrast te wurden.
I would actually just say that it is not accurate	Ik soe eins gewoan sizze dat it net krekt is
And the work goes on.	En it wurk giet troch.
I have no idea why she wanted a child	Ik haw gjin idee wêrom't se in bern woe
I was not sure where this was going	Ik wie net wis wêr't dit hinne soe
There is no going back.	Der is gjin wei werom.
But, this is the problem.	Mar, dit is it probleem.
I just could not think of him that way	Ik koe gewoan net sa oan him tinke
I can tell you nothing more	Ik kin dy neat mear fertelle
Or anywhere around.	Of wêr dan ek om hinne.
I gave the girl a hand	Ik joech it famke in hân oan
He was never found.	Hy waard nea fûn.
It was one of those.	It wie ien fan dy.
I know what they're thinking	Ik wit wat se tinke
I did not know what else to say to him	Ik wist net wat ik oars tsjin him sizze moast
I could do nothing.	Ik koe neat dwaan.
He was always just out the door.	Hy wie altyd gewoan de doar út.
This does not scare you.	Makket dit dy net bang.
It's a beautiful place.	It is in moai plak.
I did not ask him about his day.	Ik haw him net frege oer syn dei.
Her father, of course, had nothing to do with it.	Har heit hie der fansels neat oer.
He can on what, he can not.	Hy kin op wat, hy kin net.
It's true.	It is wier.
I could not hold it the first time	Ik koe it de earste kear net hâlde
His father needed him.	Syn heit hie him nedich.
Once or twice.	In kear as twa.
Do not worry about them.	Meitsje jo gjin soargen oer har.
We really are.	Wy binne echt.
If you know anything, please tell me.	As jo ​​​​wat witte, fertel my dan.
I was not at all sure what was going to happen	Ik wie der hielendal net wis fan wat der barre soe
I look forward to going back.	Ik sjoch der nei út om werom te gean.
I would make him want me	Ik soe meitsje him wol my
I just wish he liked me	Ik woe gewoan dat hy my leuk hie
What else did.	Wat oars die.
I could not eat now	Ik koe no net ite
It does not matter how and why.	It makket net út hoe en wêrom.
I was happy to leave, but I did not know why	Ik wie bliid om fuort te gean, mar ik wist net wêrom
I asked that they give it to you	Ik frege dat se it jo soene jaan
You sure did.	Jo hawwe it wis.
People were angry.	Minsken wiene lilk.
I agreed that problems always seemed to find us	Ik wie it iens dat problemen ús altyd like te finen
I need to tell you something.	Ik moat dy wat fertelle.
They are so.	Se binne sa.
It has never worked and never will.	It hat noait wurke en sil noait.
I wanted to see what would happen	Ik woe sjen wat der barre soe
Not much time left.	Net folle tiid oer.
There was one man who thought of it.	Der wie ien man dy't der oan tocht.
And my mother.	En myn mem.
You'll get used to it.	Jo sille der wol oan wenne.
There is something of that, of course.	Dêr is wat fan, fansels.
He really knows his stuff.	Hy wit echt syn dingen.
And may even be the truth.	En kin sels de wierheid wêze.
He did it really well.	Hy die it echt goed.
I did not do that.	Dat haw ik net dien.
I know she can handle anything that comes her way	Ik wit dat se alles oan kin dat har wei komt
We say do it, but do it right.	Wy sizze doch it, mar doch it goed.
I wonder what he will do now	Ik freegje my ôf wat er no dwaan sil
I wish this had never happened	Ik woe dat dit noait bard wie
Well, what a joy.	No, wat bliid.
I think they were just scared	Ik tink dat se gewoan bang wiene
I do not know what to tell them when they ask what happened.	Ik wit net wat ik har te fertellen as se freegje wat der bard is.
I never hurt myself.	Ik haw my noait sear makke.
I told him it was my car	Ik fertelde him dat it myn auto wie
And if you do not want to help him, then so be it.	En as jo him net helpe wolle, dan moat dat wol.
I did not know for sure what I would say at the meeting.	Ik wist net wis wat ik soe sizze op 'e gearkomste.
I need to see you now	Ik moat dy no sjen
I think people will be really happy	Ik tink dat minsken echt bliid sille wêze
She was never.	Se wie noait.
He thought they were gone.	Hy tocht dat se fuort wiene.
What we're talking about.	Wat wy prate.
Everything went well.	Alles gie goed.
I want to try them all	Ik wol se allegear besykje
I want to say something to him	Ik wol wat tsjin him sizze
I can love nothing but you	Ik kin neat oars as dy hâlde
In the morning they said you had gone to the office.	Fan 'e moarn seine se dat jo nei kantoar gien wiene.
Maybe you have too.	Miskien hawwe jo ek.
I love my job.	Ik hâld fan myn wurk.
I know you'll really like this guy	Ik wit dat jo dizze man echt leuk fine
Then again, and again.	Dan wer, en wer.
But it is clearly more than that.	Mar it is dúdlik mear as dat.
I have something to do	Ik haw wat te dwaan
And it's actually a year old.	En it is eins in jier âld.
I could not tell him	Ik koe it him net fertelle
Just like eating well.	Krekt as goed ite.
He found none.	Hy fûn nimmen.
Don't worry about it, really.	Sit der gjin soargen oer, echt.
I feel everything at once.	Ik fiel alles yn ien kear.
I was ready to pick him up	Ik wie ree om him op te nimmen
He had seen enough.	Hy hie genôch sjoen.
I think you might know it too.	Ik tink dat jo it ek witte kinne.
I have nothing to give you	Ik haw dy neat te jaan
That is absolutely true.	Dat is hielendal wier.
He did that so well.	Hy die dat sa goed.
You do not want that.	Dat wolle jo net.
I think it's better late than never.	Ik tink dat it better let is as noait.
I realized just what	Ik realisearre krekt wat
But my kids never made them.	Mar myn bern hawwe se noait makke.
It looks like you're almost there.	It liket derop dat jo der hast binne.
I do not think anyone even knew it was there	Ik tink net dat ien sels wist dat it der wie
I would be surprised.	Ik soe ferrast wêze.
I looked at him in surprise	Ik seach ferrast nei him
I did not mean to say that you were one of them	Ik woe net sizze dat jo ien fan har wiene
Join us if you want.	Doch mei ús as jo wolle.
It was mine.	It wie fan my.
Nothing Nothing.	Neat Neat.
I have to get in there again now	Ik moat der no wer yn
Everything happened at once.	Alles barde yn ien kear.
This is not much.	Dit is net folle.
The next day.	De folgjende dei.
One.	Ien.
They are there even more than ever.	Se binne der noch mear as ea.
He should not be told.	Hy moat net ferteld wurde.
Everyone just went to work that day.	Elkenien gie dy dei mar oan it wurk.
I tried so hard to keep everyone alive	Ik besocht sa hurd om elkenien yn libben te hâlden
I regretted it.	Ik hie der spyt fan.
I'll be waiting for you here	Ik sil hjir op dy wachtsje
I wondered where he was now	Ik frege my ôf wêr't er no wie
For me, it had just been a house. 	Foar my hie it gewoan in hûs west. 
And keep it up.	En it hâlde.
I can just see it.	Ik kin it gewoan sjen.
I know it does not work that way	Ik wit dat it net sa wurket
I have a boyfriend.	Ik haw in freon.
He was not in a place to come.	Hy wie net op it plak om te kommen.
I knew the truth.	Ik wist de wierheid.
He should have thought of that.	Hy hie der oan tinke moatten.
You may or may not like this.	Jo kinne dit wol of net leuk fine.
I'll be back in an hour.	Ik kom oer in oere werom.
It's time to watch.	It is tiid om te sjen.
I was the one who found her	Ik wie dejinge dy't har fûn
I did not hear you wake up	Ik hearde jo net wekker wurde
She liked them a lot.	Se mocht har in protte.
They had no chance.	Se hiene gjin kâns.
I really had nothing to do	Ik hie wier neat te dwaan
I could never have done it without him	Ik koe it noait sûnder him meitsje
I was right there.	Ik wie der krekt.
Must say.	Moete se.
Well, not at home.	No, net thús.
It looks just like what my mother would have done.	It liket krekt as wat myn mem soe hawwe dien.
I could see them from my office.	Ik koe se sjen fan myn kantoar.
But for this.	Mar foar dit.
I can not see what it is	Ik kin net sjen wat it is
I found this myself.	Ik haw dit sels fûn.
They had always been with her.	Se hiene altyd by har west.
He took his time.	Hy naam syn tiid.
Does he really think so.	Tinkt er echt sa.
I got ready for what was going to happen	Ik makke my klear foar wat der barre soe
She had to buy some time.	Se moast wat tiid keapje.
I tried not to get away	Ik besocht net fuort te kommen
I knew she was looking at me.	Ik wist dat se nei my seach.
It will go better.	It sil better gean.
Come on, there's food.	Kom, der is iten.
I just wanted to do a good job.	Ik woe gewoan in goede baan dwaan.
Go for it !.	Gean nei it!.
He looked different somehow.	Hy seach der op ien of oare manier oars út.
It does not matter which.	It makket neat út hokker.
People say a lot of things.	Minsken sizze in protte dingen.
That was all he told us.	Dat wie alles wat er ús fertelde.
This is not me.	Dit bin ik net.
Here he is.	Hjir is hy.
I was the old man of the class	Ik wie de âld man fan de klasse
I know you're still mad at me	Ik wit datst noch lilk op my bist
I was no longer interested	Ik wie net mear ynteressearre
We come up with something.	Wy komme mei wat.
I saw you when you did not know	Ik seach dy doe't jo it net wisten
He never found the letter.	Hy hat de brief nea fûn.
I need you to do that for me now	Ik moat dat jo dat no foar my dogge
He looked up at the boy.	Hy seach op nei de jonge.
That had been the plan.	Dat hie it plan west.
But it's her only one.	Mar it is har iennichste.
I was very worried and needed help	Ik waard heul soargen en hie help nedich
It obviously did not work.	It wurke fansels net.
Think of what may have been.	Tink oan wat kin west hawwe.
You never know what happened.	Jo witte noait wat der bard is.
I must have this really bad	Ik moat dit echt min hawwe
He knew something was going to happen.	Hy wist dat der wat barre soe.
It seemed just like that.	It like krekt sa.
She did not want to ask.	Se woe net freegje.
I will do nothing to hurt her	Ik sil neat dwaan om har sear te dwaan
She knew that was his question.	Se wist dat dat syn fraach wie.
I think we saw something different then	Ik tink dat wy dan wat oars sjoen hawwe
He never knew who you looked like.	Hy wist noait op wa't jo like.
She could leave him there for an hour.	Se koe him dêr wol in oere litte.
After a while.	Nei in bytsje.
You're a good man.	Do bist in goed man.
I would love to see that	Ik mocht der graach nei sjen
She wanted more and more.	Se woe mear en mear.
Not that she would.	Net dat se dat soe.
I had nothing more to do with it	Ik hie der neat mear oan
I know he wants to come home.	Ik wit dat er thús komme wol.
She can become a man and love another man.	Se kin in man wurde en in oare man hâlde.
I believe she knew something	Ik leau dat se wat wist
I knew she wanted to come	Ik wist dat se komme woe
I look like I was	Ik sjoch der nei as dat ik wie
I want to know what's in it	Ik wol witte wat der yn sit
No more than three, two are better, one is best.	Net mear as trije, twa binne better, ien is bêste.
I look forward to next year.	Ik sjoch út nei takom jier.
I can not wait to give up this job	Ik kin net wachtsje om dizze baan op te jaan
Maybe nothing will happen.	Miskien sil der neat barre.
It was not his idea.	It wie net syn idee.
This photo shows her doing what she did best.	Dizze foto lit har dwaan wat se it bêste die.
Nobody knew what to say.	Nimmen wist wat te sizzen.
Things will be even better than before.	Dingen sille noch better wêze as earder.
I want what she's wearing	Ik wol wat se oan hat
Someone will see it.	Immen sil it sjen.
If he's angry.	As er lilk is.
I wanted to take my time and see my best	Ik woe myn tiid nimme en myn bêste sjen
The man had him.	De man hie him.
I was too old to go in	Ik wie te âld om yn te gean
You never do anything else.	Jo dogge noait wat oars.
I think you get the picture	Ik tink dat jo de foto krije
I kept talking	Ik wie troch mei praten
Do not give up now.	Jou no net op.
I think there will be problems if he does	Ik tink dat d'r problemen sille wêze as hy dat docht
This seemed like a good idea.	Dit like in goed idee te wêzen.
I was not good at it at all	Ik wie der hielendal net goed mei
I did not want to work	Ik woe net wurkje
I've not actually been here before but that does not matter	Ik bin hjir eins net earder west mar dat makket neat út
I did not even know he was there	Ik wist net iens dat er der wie
I did not have to worry about that.	Dêr hoegde ik my gjin soargen oer te meitsjen.
Now he knew exactly how to do it.	No wist er krekt hoe't it dwaan moast.
I wish it was a question	Ik woe dat it in fraach wie
My parents had no money.	Myn âlden hiene gjin jild.
But today is his last day.	Mar hjoed is syn lêste dei.
He just hoped it wasn't too late.	Hy hope mar dat it net te let wie.
I did not know her that much	Ik koe har net sa folle
But there really is another way.	Mar d'r is echt in oare manier.
I did not know how to become a mother	Ik wist net hoe't ik mem wurde moast
There was only one problem.	Der wie mar ien probleem.
These people can help you make money.	Dizze minsken kinne jo helpe om jild te meitsjen.
He could not speak.	Hy koe net prate.
She had never made it there.	Se hie it dêr nea makke.
I want them there too.	Ik wol se dêr ek wol.
I had to talk to him	Ik moast mei him prate
Life, that is.	It libben, dat wol.
I still need to find someone who does	Ik moat noch ien fine dy't dat docht
I wanted to tell her about my mom and dad.	Ik woe har fertelle oer myn mem en heit.
Until now.	Oant no ta.
I looked through him.	Ik seach troch him hinne.
I was left with nothing	Ik bleau mei neat
He liked to play.	Hy mocht graach spylje.
It looks just fine	It liket krekt goed
I may be back very late	Ik kin tige let werom wêze
All right, all right.	Allegear, goed.
She had no money left.	Se hie gjin jild mear.
Help her to be ready.	Help har om klear te wêzen.
I can not seem to get a hand on it	Ik kin it lykje net in hân op te krijen
I've never had that before.	Dat haw ik noch nea hân.
She looked at it.	Se seach der nei.
And one for her car.	En ien foar har auto.
We've seen enough.	Wy hawwe genôch sjoen.
I love those two best	Ik hâld fan dy beide bêste
I thought about this question	Ik tocht oer dizze fraach
There is plenty to go on.	Der is genôch om te gean.
They agreed that he was	Se wiene it iens dat hy wie
I want away from this man.	Ik wol fuort fan dizze man.
He's not as angry now as he used to be.	Hy is no net sa lilk as hy wie.
Try it for yourself, you will probably like it.	Besykje it sels, jo sille it wierskynlik leuk fine.
I'm not going that way.	Ik gean net by dy wei.
You're free.	Do bist frij.
Nobody really knew what was happening.	Nimmen wist echt wat der barde.
I want you back with me	Ik wol dy werom by my
And I have a few of them too.	En dy haw ik ek in pear.
I can not help it.	Ik kin it net helpe.
But you have to do what you have to do.	Mar jo moatte dwaan wat jo moatte dwaan.
And there's a reason I do that.	En d'r is reden dat ik dat.
Love it.	Hâld fan it.
I can not think of him now	Ik kin no net oan him tinke
It was my whole life.	It wie myn hiele libben.
So happy to be here.	Sa bliid hjir te wêzen.
They have done a good job.	Se hawwe goed wurk dien.
He walked away.	Hy gie fuort.
I would love to work there myself	Ik soe dêr sels graach wurkje wolle
Just the thing, maybe.	Krekt it ding, miskien.
I believe that to be true.	Ik leau dat dat wier is.
I was just not sure of where	Ik wie gewoan net wis fan wêr't
You are a woman of your word.	Do bist in frou fan dyn wurd.
I would put money on it.	Ik soe der jild op sette.
He still knows me well.	Hy kin my noch wol.
He wants to help.	Hy wol graach helpe.
Nothing back.	Neat werom.
No other children.	Gjin oare bern.
I went after only two months.	Ik gie nei mar twa moanne.
I'll go with him tonight	Ik sil fannacht mei him gean
I must.	Ik moat.
She knows it herself.	Se wit it sels.
Even more than ever.	Noch mear as eartiids.
The new you is who you want to be.	De nije jo is wa't jo wêze wolle.
I've been there.	Ik bin dêr west.
You do not have to worry.	Jo moatte gjin soargen.
I would not worry about your parents	Ik soe my gjin soargen meitsje oer dyn âlden
She could see nothing.	Se koe neat sjen.
It's not what it seems.	It is net wat it liket.
The same thing happened to me.	Itselde barde my.
But there is no chance.	Mar der is gjin kâns.
She did not know how much but one thing was certain.	Se wist net hoefolle mar ien ding wie wis.
And sure enough, it was.	En wis genôch, it wie.
I also did not feel well now	Ik fielde my ek net goed no
That's what I would like	Dat soe ik wol graach wolle
I wondered what was in it	Ik frege my ôf wat der yn siet
I just could not take it anymore	Ik koe it gewoan net mear
I do not know what is more true	Ik wit net wat mear wier is
And of course you know that was real.	En jo witte fansels dat dat echt wie.
That should not have happened.	Dat hie net moatten.
He no longer looked at himself.	Hy like net mear op himsels.
I see him there.	Ik sjoch him dêr.
You can work hard.	Jo kinne hurd wurkje.
I was wondering where you were going	Ik frege my ôf wêr't jo hinne wiene
Mom had given me the ride.	Mem hie my it riden jûn.
He opened it.	Hy die it iepen.
I did not think so about him	Ik ha net sa oer him tocht
So we have to see.	Sa moatte wy sjen.
That's what we do.	Dat dogge wy.
I could not believe it	Dat koe ik my net leauwe litte
That was it.	Dat wie it.
None of your friends.	Neat fan dyn freonen.
There would be no questions.	Der soene gjin fragen wêze.
I need it so badly.	Ik ha it sa nedich.
You just did it.	Jo hawwe it gewoan dien.
It was to help me see.	It wie om my te helpen sjen.
I am the truth.	Ik bin de wierheid.
I still have a lot of it	Ik haw der noch in protte fan
That still seems so.	Dat liket noch wol sa.
He could not do that again.	Dat koe er net wer.
But maybe it was something else.	Mar miskien wie it wat oars.
I did not want to leave her.	Ik woe har net litte.
We both want to win.	Wy wolle beide graach winne.
Never, it seems, to come back.	Nea, liket it, werom te kommen.
I would not be afraid of it	Ik soe der net bang foar wêze
We need to know where we are.	Wy moatte witte wêr't wy binne.
I thought of her	Ik tocht wol oan har
I almost regretted taking him two years ago	Ik ha hast spyt fan him twa jier lyn te nimmen
No one should ever know.	Nimmen soe ea witte moatte.
I think you like it.	Ik tink dat jo it leuk fine.
I need to know how she's doing	Ik moat witte hoe't it mei har giet
It just wasn’t quite enough.	It wie gewoan net hielendal genôch.
I thought you were my best friend	Ik tocht dat jo myn bêste freon wiene
But whatever she was, she was happy.	Mar wat se ek wie, se wie bliid.
Maybe it's true.	Miskien is it wier.
I left a good job for him	Ik liet in goede baan foar him
Well, look at me.	No, sjoch my oan.
They just.	Se gewoan.
But you know, maybe there is something too.	Mar jo witte, miskien is der ek wat.
I had a lot to tell her	Ik hie har in protte te fertellen
I only heard words	Ik hearde allinnich wurden
Not quite, but it's not much more.	Net hielendal, mar it is net folle mear.
I can only stay a few days	Ik kin mar in pear dagen bliuwe
It does not look good.	It sjocht der goed út net.
I could not ask for more	Ik koe net freegje om mear
It did so.	It die sa.
Really it's good.	Echt it is goed.
He was at home.	Hy wie thús.
And so it seems we have.	En sa liket it dat wy hawwe.
I thought they would look after him better	Ik tocht dat se better nei him sjen soene
You will like them.	Jo sille har leuk fine.
He stands up.	Hy stiet oan.
I knew exactly what to do	Ik wist krekt wat te dwaan
I did not want her, not yet	Ik woe har net, noch net
It's about the people.	It giet om de minsken.
Now and then.	No en sa.
He still loves her.	Hy hâldt noch fan har.
I did not see the big problem	Ik seach it grutte probleem net
I let him look at me	Ik lit him nei my sjen
It was the meeting tomorrow.	It wie moarn de gearkomste.
I can not agree to talk to anyone.	Ik kin net iens mei immen prate.
Tell it scared.	Fertel it bang.
I went to.	Ik gie nei.
I can not take the last picture either	De lêste foto kin ik ek net meitsje
I have not talked to anyone other than my parents	Ik ha mei gjinien oars praat as myn âlden
She would find her car soon enough.	Se soe har auto gau genôch fine.
He had thought it enough.	Hy hie it genôch tocht.
That really struck me.	Dat rekke my echt.
I went back to the meeting.	Ik gie werom yn 'e gearkomste.
She could not do it now.	Se koe it no net.
She did not have to speak.	Se hoegde net te praten.
This will help a lot.	Dit sil in protte helpe.
So it got a little long.	Sa waard it wat lang.
I did not want that at all.	Dat woe ik hielendal net.
He was just nice.	Hy wie gewoan aardich.
He still did not know everyone.	Hy koe noch net elkenien.
I was with him for almost two years	Ik wie hast twa jier by him
I'm not coming home tonight	Ik kom fannacht net thús
I just took the opportunity to see her	Ik naam de kâns gewoan om har te sjen
I never ask for any of this	Ik freegje noait om ien fan dit
I'm not in a bad place.	Ik bin net op in min plak.
See that there is no one who can do anything.	Sjoch dat der gjinien is dy't wat dwaan kin.
And he will ask you.	En hy sil dy freegje.
I'm glad he's here.	Ik bin bliid dat er hjir is.
I'm awake, but there's nothing to eat	Ik bin wekker, mar der is neat te iten
Of course it happened to everyone, but so too.	Fansels barde it mei elkenien, mar ek sa.
I still remember that girl from the party	Ik wit noch dat famke fan it feest
There was nothing for me to do.	Der wie neat foar my te dwaan.
I could easily take one of them to bed	Ik koe ien fan har maklik op bêd nimme
He thinks he knows everything.	Hy tinkt dat er alles wit.
You get it.	Jo krije it.
I just told you that	Dat sei ik dy krekt
But go away.	Mar gean fuort.
And something too nice.	En wat te aardich.
You will probably ask why.	Jo sille wierskynlik freegje wêrom.
They can not see me.	Se kinne my net sjen.
We have to go.	Wy moatte fuort.
I did not really know what was going on	Ik wist net echt wat der oan de hân wie
I saw them '.	Ik seach se'.
I can keep the door open	Ik kin de doar iepen hâlde
I hope they were all good	Ik hoopje dat se allegear goed wiene
But, here it is.	Mar, hjir is it.
I knew that and he would never say otherwise	Dat wist ik en hy soe noait oars sizze
Man was my friend, and he did not know.	Man wie myn freon, en hy wist net.
I knew it for a long time	Ik wist it al lang
What is certain is that no one met him.	Wat wis is, is dat gjinien mei him moete.
I have to work.	Ik moat wurkje.
I've talked to this guy.	Ik haw mei dizze man praat.
A few more weeks before she could see her	Noch in pear wike foardat se har sjen koe
I know you want something	Ik wit dat jo wat wolle
She walked home.	Se rûn nei hûs.
Someone gets in trouble and gets out of there again.	Immen komt yn de problemen en komt der wer út.
I will never be the same	Ik sil noait itselde wêze
But they are much more than that.	Mar se binne folle mear as dat.
I saw her to her room and everything was fine	Ik seach har nei har keamer en alles wie goed
It will never be and it never was.	It sil nea wêze en it wie noait.
Time goes by.	De tiid giet.
Just having a good time.	Krekt hawwe in goede tiid.
I could never hold him	Ik koe him noait hâlde
I'll talk to her.	Ik sil mei har prate.
I have to get back to work.	Ik moat wer oan it wurk.
I have to do the right thing	Ik moat it goede ding dwaan
On his own he is nothing.	Op himsels is er neat.
Until it does, there is reason to worry.	Oant it docht, is der reden om soargen te meitsjen.
That's just wrong.	Dat is gewoan ferkeard.
I never asked him to come here	Ik haw him noait frege om hjir te kommen
I can even go to his house	Ik kin sels by him thús gean
I'm still helping him	Ik help him noch
The idea took me over.	It idee naam my oer.
I did not ask you to return it.	Ik haw dy net frege it werom te jaan.
I had to be there when she woke up	Ik moast der wêze as se wekker waard
But he is still with us.	Mar hy is noch by ús.
I totally agree.	Ik bin it hielendal iens.
She will, if she can.	Se sil, as se kin.
The plan went pretty well.	It plan gie aardich goed.
I did not think that something could really hurt him.	Ik tocht net dat wat him echt sear dwaan koe.
To help you.	Om dy te helpen.
I talked to him a few days ago	Ik praat mei him in pear dagen lyn
To me, they are pretty clear	Foar my binne se frij dúdlik
I'm not doing a bad thing.	Ik doch gjin min ding.
I could do nothing about it	Ik koe der neat oan dwaan
I take him at his word	Ik nim him op syn wurd
There was a problem.	Dêr wie in probleem.
I do not have to think about her	Ik moat net oan har tinke
Or, they should.	Of, se moatte.
That would have been easy enough.	Dat hie maklik genôch west.
I doubt we can get anything different from them	Ik twifelje oan dat wy wat oars fan har krije kinne
I still had absolutely no idea what to tell him.	Ik hie noch hielendal gjin idee wat ik him fertelle moast.
I still do them	Ik doch se noch
Do not be sick !.	Wês net siik!.
I know that was my mother	Ik wit dat myn mem wie
Living.	Wenje.
But it's good we've found it.	Mar it is goed dat wy it fûn hawwe.
I just wish my mom was my mom again	Ik woe gewoan dat myn mem wer myn mem wie
Nobody said a word to him.	Nimmen sei in wurd tsjin him.
I wish the whole room knew you were mine	Ik woe dat de hiele keamer wist dat jo fan my wiene
But it was also more than that.	Mar it wie ek mear as dat.
It's fun, but it's hard.	It is leuk, mar it is dreech.
Know your husband.	Ken dyn man.
I wondered what his family was like	Ik frege my ôf hoe't syn famylje wie
There's only one thing that does not work.	Der is mar ien ding dat net wurket.
I was talking about that.	Dêr hie ik oer.
We were obviously very pleased with his letter.	Wy wiene fansels tige bliid mei syn brief.
I told you to go away	Ik sei dy fuort te gean
It was really very bad for me.	It wie echt heul min foar my.
I just can not talk to her right now	Ik kin no gewoan net mei har prate
Also, it was a lot for one person.	Ek wie it in protte foar ien persoan.
I should have asked you	Ik hie dy freegje moatten
I wish he was here with me	Ik winskje dat er hjir by my wie
But it was too late for that now.	Mar dêr wie it no te let foar.
I could not see enough of her to tell	Ik koe net genôch fan har sjen om te fertellen
I still remember him	Ik tink noch oan him
But she was not interested.	Mar se wie net ynteressearre.
I go to school to her house	Ik gean nei skoalle nei har hûs
But he had to get it just right.	Mar hy moast it krekt goed krije.
We do this all the time.	Wy dogge dit de hiele tiid.
I told him not to tell you	Ik sei tsjin him om it dy net te fertellen
I really wanted to go	Ik woe echt gean
I just want to help you	Ik wol dy gewoan helpe
I just love reading.	Ik hâld gewoan fan lêzen.
I had no idea where you were	Ik hie gjin idee wêr't jo wiene
I could do that	Ik mocht sa dwaan
That's what he told you.	Dat hat er dy sein.
We have you now.	Wy hawwe dy no.
Maybe it was for him.	Miskien wie it foar him.
He does the same thing.	Hy die itselde ding.
I did not think so	Ik hie der net sa oan tocht
It felt different.	It fielde oars.
We totally agree.	Wy binne it hielendal iens.
She really does not need me.	Se hat my echt net nedich.
They were not ready yet.	Se wiene noch net klear.
I feel it too.	Ik fiel it ek.
I'm really a different person now	Ik bin no echt in oare persoan
By this, if.	Troch dit, as.
And then another.	En dan noch ien.
There she came, he said.	Dêr kaam se, sei er.
And not to the door.	En net nei de doar.
But it did happen.	Mar it barde wol.
I want to know about this girl.	Ik wol witte oer dit famke.
Maybe we can really find something.	Miskien kinne wy ​​echt wat fine.
Not everyone was interested and not everyone could make it.	Net allegear wiene ynteressearre en net allegear koene it meitsje.
I'm not sure if it will be.	Ik bin der net wis fan oft it sil wêze.
You will know who you are and know what you have done for me.	Jo sille witte wa't jo binne en witte wat jo foar my dien hawwe.
I have to be that bit	Ik moat sa'n bytsje wêze
If he's good, he's good.	As hy goed is, is hy goed.
I can see you're busy	Ik kin sjen dat jo it drok hawwe
And this just does not look good.	En dit liket gewoan net goed.
I think there is more than one.	Ik tink dat der mear as ien is.
I wondered if that was as good	Ik frege my ôf oft dat like goed wie
Boy, you should have seen me take the water.	Jonge, do hiest my it wetter sjen moatten nimme.
One he could easily get to do what he wanted.	Ien dy't er maklik krije koe om te dwaan wat er woe.
It's what he does.	It is wat hy docht.
I could not afford to go out or do anything	Ik koe it my net betelje om út te gean of wat te dwaan
It's good to be wrong.	It is goed om ferkeard te wêzen.
She is like a mother to me.	Se is as mem foar my.
We always have to go back.	Wy moatte altyd werom.
It's so real to me.	It is sa echt foar my.
I wish he could see this	Ik winskje dat hy dit koe sjen
A lot of people.	In protte minsken.
He does the good work.	Hy die goed wurk.
And got it.	En krige it.
Everything seemed so clear.	Alles like sa dúdlik.
Many other people	In protte oare minsken
You find that one out.	Jo fine dat ien út.
I was not in the room.	Ik wie net yn 'e keamer.
I continued the song	Ik sette it liet troch
I see you have a problem.	Ik sjoch dat jo in probleem hawwe.
Anyone who knew it had not told.	Elkenien dy't it wist hie net ferteld.
There will be three more tomorrow and then we'll see.	Der komme moarn noch trije en dan sille wy sjen.
I'm pretty convinced	Ik bin aardich oertsjûge
They do not open.	Se geane net iepen.
I felt a little sick now	Ik fielde my no wat siik
I'll be better tomorrow.	Ik sil moarn better wêze.
I love you here	Ik hâld fan dy hjir
This was done without any problems	Dit waard dien sûnder problemen
It's not a guy.	It is gjin keardel.
I wanted to try to make something different	Ik woe besykje wat oars te meitsjen
I did not want to leave.	Ik woe net fuort.
He had seen himself as a man.	Hy hie himsels sjoen as in man.
I tried to eat the book	Ik besocht it boek te iten
Not even the name.	Net iens de namme.
You do not need them.	Jo hawwe har net nedich.
Not sure of the name.	Net wis fan 'e namme.
Give him a chance to be himself.	Jou him in kâns om himsels te wêzen.
I think it's obviously clear	Ik tink dat it fansels dúdlik is
I'll show you how it's done.	Ik sil dy sjen litte hoe't it dien is.
We have one mother and one father.	Wy hawwe ien mem en ien heit.
Please see it.	Graach it sjen.
I wish everything was so easy	Ik winskje dat alles sa maklik wie
She was so tired.	Se wie sa wurch.
I think of you and your family so often.	Ik tink sa faak oan dy en dyn famylje.
I was there for him when he needed me	Ik wie der foar him doe't hy my nedich hie
I had no chance.	Ik hie gjin kâns om.
They just did not have the money.	Se hiene it jild gewoan net.
I need you to believe me	Ik moat dat jo my leauwe
The money did not seem real.	It jild like net echt.
Then you find out what's going on.	Dan fine jo út wat der bart.
I'm not quite sure	Ik bin der net hielendal wis fan
They do everything in the right way.	Se dogge alles op 'e goede manier.
I was just looking at it	Ik seach der gewoan nei
I was there on time and so was he	Ik wie der op tiid en hy ek
I thought my dad was a good guy	Ik tocht dat myn heit in goede keardel wie
Even though.	Sels.
Not so much.	Net safolle.
He let her go with her mother.	Hy liet har mei har mem gean.
But she does not think so.	Mar dat tinkt se net.
I would have given anything for her to stay	Ik soe alles jûn hawwe foar har om te bliuwen
Now if only I could get the time.	No as ik mar de tiid krije kin.
I believe they would do that	Ik leau dat se dat dwaan soene
I would ask.	Ik soe freegje.
A woman and another woman cannot become one.	In frou en in oare frou kinne net ien wurde.
I hope to see you again soon	Ik hoopje dy gau wer te sjen
And, to the words.	En, nei de wurden.
We need more of that	Dêr ha wy mear fan nedich
What a boy.	Wat in jonge.
He stayed for more than a week.	Hy bleau mear as in wike.
I could not get enough of him	Ik koe net genôch fan him
We could try to do that.	Dat koene wy ​​besykje te dwaan.
There were always more.	Der wiene altyd mear.
It could not be otherwise.	It koe net oars.
That's what you saw.	Dat hawwe jo sjoen.
Maybe even as long as a week.	Miskien sels sa lang as in wike.
I knew she was just out of school.	Ik wist dat se krekt út skoalle wie.
I have children.	Ik haw bern.
And we'm glad we did.	En wy binne bliid dat wy dien hawwe.
You have me '.	Jo hawwe my'.
We get it a lot.	Wy krije it in protte.
I was not even sure he would come home again	Ik wie der net iens wis fan dat er wer thús komme soe
I should be tired	Ik soe wurch wêze moatte
I just wanted to get out of there	Ik woe der mar út
Like she was scared of me or something.	As wie se bang foar my of sa.
And another one.	En noch ien.
You make the book real.	Jo meitsje it boek echt.
It should be clear.	It moat dúdlik wêze.
I would not, of course	Ik soe net, fansels
They are so good.	Se binne sa goed.
I found a way.	Ik fûn in manier.
Maybe she should have.	Miskien hie se moatten.
She could not help herself.	Se koe har net helpe.
I'll get it in you.	Ik sil it yn dy krije.
I keep the door open for you	Ik hâld de doar iepen foar jo
For her, that was good.	Foar har wie dat goed.
People love you.	Minsken hâlde fan dy.
Not the way you like it.	Net sa as jo der fan hâlde.
I did not want to stop	Ik woe net ophâlde
These are good things.	Dit binne goede dingen.
Neither.	Ek net.
It's my chance.	It is myn kâns.
It's not what you think.	It is net wat jo tinke.
By that time, it was too late.	Tsjin dy tiid wie it te let.
It was my last day.	It wie myn lêste dei.
He touched me deeply.	Hy rekke my tige oan.
I found a city there	Ik fûn dêr in stêd
She will never be the same.	Se sil nea wêze deselde.
She would not let it go.	Se soe it net litte.
He might like to be there.	Hy mocht der graach wêze.
There is not much more to say.	Der is net folle mear te sizzen.
I have even seen it to be so	Ik haw sels sjoen dat it sa is
Just like that every now and then.	Krekt sa no en dan.
But we are your family now.	Mar wy binne no dyn famylje.
I was just wondering	Ik frege my gewoan wat ôf
Maybe not one.	Miskien net ien.
I do not believe that	Dat leau ik net
Now he said not a word.	No sei er gjin wurd.
This was not what he needed.	Dit wie net wat er nedich hie.
I feel a little surprised	Ik fiel my wat ferrast
It is far from certain.	It is lang net wis.
I am afraid for the lives of our children	Ik bin bang foar it libben fan ús bern
I want to be with you, together, as a couple	Ik wol by dy wêze, tegearre, as in pear
We hope so.	Wy hoopje dat.
I asked her to stay tuned	Ik frege har om by te bliuwen
I could not help it	Ik koe it my net helpe
I did not arrive there in time to see	Ik kaam der net op tiid om te sjen
You can stay as long as you want.	Jo kinne bliuwe sa lang as jo wolle.
I only met him a few times	Ik moete him mar in pear kear
I wondered where we were	Ik frege my ôf wêr't wy binne
I see people all the time	Ik sjoch de minsken de hiele tiid
I did not expect it at all	Ik hie it hielendal net ferwachte
I know you still care about me	Ik wit dat jo noch om my soargje
We do not even have to talk about it again.	Wy hoege der net iens wer oer te praten.
I can not believe you even thought about it	Ik kin net leauwe dat jo der sels oan tocht hawwe
I think he could make you happy	Ik tink dat hy koe meitsje dy bliid
I have to keep you with me.	Ik moat dy by my bliuwe.
I need to get to work soon	Ik moat gau oan it wurk
This is not it.	Dit is it net.
He could play forever.	Hy koe foar altyd spylje.
I need you to come back here with your wife	Ik haw jo nedich om hjir werom te kommen mei jo frou
I already know all this	Ik wit dit alles al
If not, ask.	As net, freegje dan.
I'm not really sure what to do.	Ik bin der net echt wis fan wat te dwaan.
I was still fine.	Ik hie it noch goed.
I do not know how you did it, but it does not matter.	Ik wit net hoe't jo it dien hawwe, mar it makket neat út.
They should not talk, so.	Se moatte net prate, sa.
But you do not know who we are.	Mar jo witte net wa't wy binne.
That is no longer true.	Dat is net mear wier.
I had to stop.	Ik moast ophâlde.
And I have to.	En ik moat.
And that's good.	En dat is goed.
I did not have to worry	Ik hie gjin soargen moatten
They made things up.	Se makke dingen op.
He was and still is my friend.	Hy wie en is noch altyd myn freon.
That is the life that comes with it.	Dat is it libben dat der mei komt.
I thought it was time to get home	Ik tocht dat it tiid wie om thús te kommen
I have nothing to go back to	Ik haw neat om werom te gean
Maybe it's coming back.	Miskien komt it werom.
I did not look back	Ik seach net wer werom
But it's not a bad thing.	Mar it is gjin min ding.
But there is no one who does that.	Mar d'r is gjinien dy't dat docht.
I was not.	Ik wier net.
I told him to stop coming	Ik fertelde him om op te hâlden mei te kommen
I was actually scared.	Ik waard eins bang.
Think about this.	Tink oer dit.
They did everything well.	Se diene alles goed.
You'll have to do something about it.	Jo sille der wat mei dwaan moatte.
I see things, feel things that other people cannot	Ik sjoch dingen, fiel dingen, dy't oare minsken net kinne
They were not sure where they were going.	Se wiene net wis wêr't se hinne soene.
It came to my home.	It kaam by my thús.
I will not tell anyone about it either	Ik sil der ek noch net ien oer fertelle
We've been there.	Wy ha der west.
I would have time for that	Ik soe der tiid foar ha
They stop it at once.	Se hâlde it yn ien kear op.
First, of course, it came.	As earste kaam it fansels.
I still have a lot of time	Ik haw noch in protte tiid
She went up there a few more times.	Se gie der noch in pear kear op.
See you in class.	Oant sjen yn 'e klasse.
I can not wait to see what you all make!	Ik kin net wachtsje om te sjen wat jo allegear meitsje!
What it does is give people another chance.	Wat it docht is minsken in oare kâns te jaan.
This is it.	Dit is it.
Love how it looks on my hand.	Hâld fan hoe't it liket op myn hân.
I did not know this man, and he did not know me	Ik koe dizze man net, en hy koe my net
She went through me to get them.	Se gie troch my hinne om se te krijen.
I did not like it.	Ik fûn it net leuk.
There is no such office.	Der is gjin sa'n kantoar.
I look back on mom	Ik sjoch werom nei mem
But it was different this time.	Mar it wie dizze kear oars.
I was in enough trouble.	Ik wie yn de problemen genôch.
I would need a lot of help.	Ik soe in protte help nedich hawwe.
It can be anyone.	It kin elkenien wêze.
I want to be absolutely sure of that.	Ik wol der hielendal wis fan wêze.
But we can not help you with that.	Mar dêr kinne wy ​​jo net mei helpe.
That was not the case now.	Sa wie it no net.
I wonder if she has anything underneath	Ik freegje my ôf oft se der wat ûnder hat
I want to talk about us	Ik wol wol oer ús prate
I agree with you that it was.	Ik bin it mei dy iens dat it wie.
We do not agree with that either.	Dêr binne wy ​​it ek net mei iens.
He knew where.	Hy wist wêr.
I got angry.	Ik waard lilk.
We pay, and we do not pay enough.	Wy betelje, en wy betelje net genôch.
I think we only need one	Ik tink dat wy mar ien nedich hawwe
I think you treated me in a way to her	Ik tink dat jo my op in manier oan har diene
People love them, buy them, and tell their friends to buy them.	Minsken hâlde fan har, keapje se, en fertel har freonen om se te keapjen.
I saw that it was too late	Ik seach dat it te let wie
I will always believe that	Dat sil ik altyd leauwe
I could not believe this at first	Ik koe dizze earst net leauwe
Just watch this happen.	Sjoch dit gewoan bart.
I'm not sure if you would be interested.	Ik bin der net wis fan oft jo soe wêze ynteressearre.
I'm sorry about all that	It spyt my fan dat alles
Everything came to me.	Alles kaam by my.
I've seen that name before.	Ik haw dy namme al earder sjoen.
I got a wife.	Ik krige in frou.
You do not have to do much.	Jo hoege net folle te dwaan.
Quite simply, we needed the money.	Hiel gewoan, wy hiene it jild nedich.
Nobody said a word.	Nimmen sei in wurd.
It's hard to do.	It is dreech om te dwaan.
I hope you will help us	Ik hoopje dat jo ús sille helpe
I see things differently now	Ik sjoch dingen no oars
I just thought about things	Ik tocht gewoan oer dingen
There was no one to be found.	Der wie gjinien te finen.
I did not know what to make of it	Ik wist net wat ik der fan meitsje moast
I need to know what he's like	Ik moat witte hoe't hy is
There was no one else around.	Der wie nimmen oars om.
She would love to have it.	Se soe it graach hawwe.
Love u.	Hâld fan dy.
I want to talk to him first	Ik wol earst mei him prate
I did not think so.	Ik tocht net.
I will not show it to anyone	Ik sil dy oan gjinien sjen litte
A life to be a child	In libben om in bern te wêzen
You say you're going back home.	Jo sizze dat jo werom nei hûs geane.
It felt like coming to life with yourself.	It fielde as om sels mei it libben te kommen.
He wanted his wife to get along well with his family.	Hy woe dat syn frou goed mei syn famylje koe.
I do not think that is true	Ik tink net dat dat wierheid is
I have not seen you like that	Ik haw dy net sa sjoen
We have that at my home.	Dat ha wy by my thús.
I could work with this	Ik koe wurkje mei dit
Of course it is not.	Fansels is it net.
To him.	Oan him.
It never worked.	It hat noait wurke.
It's not your truth.	It is net dyn wierheid.
It's fun for the whole family.	It is leuk foar de hiele famylje.
Your hair is beautiful and long.	Jo hier is moai en lang.
I think he knows that	Ik tink dat hy dat wit
I could do anything	Ik koe wat dwaan
I can not do that this time.	Ik kin dat dizze kear net dwaan.
Not without me.	Net sûnder my.
I'm not a fan of that yet.	Ik bin noch net sa'n fan.
I wish he had not said that	Ik woe dat er dat net sein hie
This is the last chance to get him back this year.	Dit is de lêste kâns om him dit jier werom te krijen.
I actually thought that might be fun to watch and try.	Ik eins tocht dat kin wêze leuk om te sjen en besykje.
Everything went well.	Alles gie goed.
Everyone would look at me.	Elkenien soe nei my sjen.
This had nothing to do with him.	Dit hie neat mei him te krijen.
I was away, but not much	Ik wie fuort, mar net folle
I will never stop doing that	Ik sil noait ophâlde mei dat
We never tell the truth about our parents.	Wy fertelle noait de wierheid oer ús âlden.
My children.	Myn bern.
But this can not be otherwise.	Mar dit kin net oars.
You have the job, so far.	Jo hawwe de baan, oant no ta.
But not with you, or, not at all with you.	Mar net mei dy, of, net hielendal mei dy.
She was scared now.	Se wie no bang.
I'm already started mine	Ik bin myn al begûn
She looked over.	Se seach oer.
I could not be with him	Ik koe net by him wêze
She was very good at her job.	Se wie tige goed yn har wurk.
I could not help him much	Ik koe him net folle helpe
I want to go home, he thought.	Ik wol nei hûs, tocht er.
But again, do not go.	Mar wer, net gean.
He is nothing like you have read before.	Hy is neat as jo earder hawwe lêzen.
There's no way they can do that.	D'r is gjin kâns dat se dat kinne dwaan.
I've heard so much about you.	Ik haw safolle oer dy heard.
I was the only man there	Ik wie dêr de ienige man
Which is good for the dog.	Wat is goed foar de hûn.
I love you both more than life	Ik hâld fan dy beide mear as it libben
But we need your help.	Mar wy hawwe jo help nedich.
That comes with the job for many.	Dat komt mei de baan foar in protte.
When he came back, he was all right.	Doe't er werom kaam, wie er hielendal goed.
You should not.	Jo moatte net.
Get there.	Kom dêr ta.
Now it was just me.	No wie it gewoan ik.
It was time for him	It wie tiid foar him
I just want to take him home	Ik wol him mar mei nei hûs nimme
It's not too good either.	It is ek net al te goed.
I wonder where he is now	Ik freegje my ôf wêr't er no is
It does not seem to me.	It liket my net.
I know this guy.	Ik ken dizze keardel.
I was first in my class	Ik wie earste yn myn klasse
Maybe you do things a little differently.	Miskien dogge jo dingen in bytsje oars.
I would love to see her again.	Ik soe har graach wer sjen.
I had this just good time	Ik moast dit krekt goed tiid
Not necessary.	Net nedich.
I only have a few questions	Ik haw mar in pear fragen
Reason is, that's all you get back.	Reden is, dat is alles wat jo werom krije.
Really, the only one.	Echt, de ienige.
I can do that myself at home	Dat kin ik sels thús dwaan
I did not think anyone would do that for anyone	Ik tocht net dat immen dat foar immen dwaan soe
She could not speak.	Se koe net prate.
I did not worry about her	Ik makke my gjin soargen oer har
I would never think that	Dat soe ik noait tinke
That's what I told you.	Dat haw ik dy sein.
That does not seem to be the case.	Dat liket net te wêzen.
The next hour she told me all about school.	It folgjende oere fertelde se my alles oer skoalle.
I did not want them	Ik woe se net
I tried to look at her	Ik besocht har nei my te sjen
Clear.	Dúdlik.
That we worry about what we should do, think or say.	Dat wy ús soargen meitsje oer wat wy dwaan, tinke of sizze moatte.
It will be there.	It sil der wêze.
I can do nothing to her	Ik kin neat oan har dwaan
Then, do it again and again.	Dan, doch it wer en wer.
We know he's with you.	Wy witte dat hy by dy is.
I did not know this woman	Ik koe dizze frou net
To see that it does not happen.	Om te sjen dat it net bart.
She could handle it all though, she said.	Se koe it allegear wol soargje, sei se.
Or too much of me.	Of te folle fan my.
I thought about it for a long time	Ik tocht der lang oer nei
Waiting to be found.	Wachtsje op fûn wurde.
I did everything yesterday and today	Ik haw juster en hjoed alles dien
I know this seems hard to you	Ik wit dit liket hurd foar jo
I have a lot to do tomorrow	Ik haw moarn in protte te dwaan
I should not look at it	Ik soe der net nei sjen moatte
But it is one that can help many people.	Mar it is ien dy't in protte minsken kin helpe.
I opened them, of course	Ik makke se iepen, fansels
I will not have it anymore	Ik sil it net mear ha
I'll just say that.	Dat sil ik mar sizze.
I knew exactly how the man felt	Ik wist krekt hoe't de man him fielde
I know you like her and she loves you	Ik wit dat jo har leuk fine en se hâldt fan dy
I've been here before.	Ik haw hjir earder west.
That's what I told them a long time ago	Dat haw ik se al lang lyn ferteld
It happened to me too.	It barde my ek.
He should have let it go.	Hy hie it gean litte moatten.
Not surprised, really.	Net ferrast, echt.
And what if you do not find them? 	En wat as jo har net fine?
he asked himself.	frege er himsels ôf.
I can not believe she's mine	Ik kin net leauwe dat se fan my is
Just what they needed.	Krekt wat se nedich wiene.
It is and it is not.	It is en it is net.
It may not be necessary, but it's easy to do.	It kin net nedich wêze, mar it is maklik om te dwaan.
I know it.	Ik wit it.
We know of no one.	Wy witte fan gjinien.
I can not really say what it is	Ik kin net echt sizze wat it is
She had made it so easy for him.	Se hie it him sa maklik makke.
I think that's where he's at his best.	Ik tink dat is wêr't hy op syn bêste is.
There was not much left.	Der wie net folle oer.
They hurt people.	Se dogge minsken sear.
I saw her as a friend	Ik seach har as in freon
I wonder if it works	Ik freegje my ôf oft it wurket
Here is a good place.	Hjir is in goed plak.
I can tell you nothing more	Ik kin dy neat mear fertelle
The people have no chance of getting out of here.	De minsken hawwe gjin kâns om hjir út te kommen.
I had been busy.	Ik hie it drok hân.
Not in my life.	Net yn myn libben.
Clearly we will.	Dúdlik sille wy.
They just work better.	Se wurkje gewoan better.
They will know what to do with you.	Se sille witte wat se mei dy dwaan moatte.
I could not see it here	Ik koe it hjir net sjen
I was just so angry the whole time	Ik wie gewoan sa lilk de hiele tiid
I liked this man.	Ik mocht fan dizze man.
You should never have seen this once.	Jo moatte dit noait iens sjoen hawwe.
That she will see.	Dat sil se sjen.
My work is so good.	Myn wurk is sa goed.
She looked back at the house.	Se seach werom nei it hûs.
I never told anyone	Ik haw it noait oan ien ferteld
She's a you know what.	Se is in jo witte wat.
But come on in.	Mar kom yn.
Nobody talks about this.	Nimmen hat it oer dit.
I might be able to.	Ik soe miskien kinne.
I think this was a bad idea	Ik tink dat dit in min idee wie
It needs it.	It hat it nedich.
I believe you met my husband last night	Ik leau dat jo myn man fannacht moete hawwe
He had not heard it.	Hy hie it net heard.
You can help people find a good car.	Jo kinne minsken helpe by it finen fan in goede auto.
Do what it says.	Doch wat it seit.
We do not talk about what we do for them.	Wy prate net oer wat wy foar har dogge.
Here's what you can do.	Hjir is wat jo kinne dwaan.
I have a book to give you	Ik haw in boek te jaan dy
But they had no time.	Mar se hiene gjin tiid.
We could never be friends.	Wy koene noait freonen wêze.
It would be better for us.	It soe better wêze foar ús.
I could not be so much at home.	Ik mocht net sa folle thús wêze.
I also had to take care of him	Ik moast ek foar him soargje
If so, do something.	As dat sa is, dwaan wat.
The house had told me that too.	Dat hie it hûs my ek sein.
It will be better this way.	It sil op dizze manier better wêze.
We're wondering how it's going	Wy freegje ús ôf hoe't it giet
An old guy.	In âld keardel.
Nice house, people would say.	Moai hûs, soene de minsken sizze.
There was no going back now.	Der wie no gjin mear werom.
Show him the money.	Lit him it jild sjen.
Well, he should take a chance.	No, hy soe in kâns nimme moatte.
I should have said she already had one	Ik hie sizze moatten dat se al ien hie
I had never been to another school before	Ik hie noch noait op in oare skoalle west
Tell us everything.	Fertel ús alles.
I could no longer.	Ik koe net mear.
He just did not want them.	Hy woe se net.
I think that should do some work.	Ik tink dat moat wat wurk.
I already knew what was going on down there	Ik wist al wat der ûnder gie
I never saw him want anything so badly	Ik seach him noait wat sa graach wolle
But that's how it is.	Mar it is hoe it is.
That's what it's always about.	Dêr giet it altyd om.
And not only give, but also do.	En net allinnich jaan, mar ek dwaan.
I will never know that either.	Dat sil ik ek nea witte.
I never saw her talk to anyone	Ik seach har noait mei immen prate
I should say the same to you.	Ik soe itselde tsjin dy sizze moatte.
I did not think it would be so difficult	Ik tocht net dat it sa dreech wurde soe
She can not have it.	Se kin it net hawwe.
I would love to see it one day	Ik soe it graach sjen op in dei
He just looked.	Hy seach gewoan.
Your mother is a good wife.	Jo mem is in goede frou.
I really believe that.	Ik leau dat echt.
I can see where this is going now.	Ik kin sjen wêr't dit no giet.
I have not done anything for a long time	Ik haw al lang neat makke
He has been there, he has done that.	Hy hat der west, dat hat er dien.
Well, then, must be a woman.	No, moat dan in frou wêze.
I tried to see her and make her fun	Ik besocht har te sjen en har leuk te meitsjen
I know they are not happy to see me see them	Ik wit dat se net bliid binne om te sjen dat ik har sjoch
I would not have done it	Ik soe it net dien hawwe
I think even interested in him.	Ik tink sels ynteressearre yn him.
It's just how old people are.	It is krekt hoe âld minsken binne.
We even stayed home all evening.	Wy ha de hiele jûn sels thús west.
I want to know who you're talking about	Ik wit wol oer wa't jo it hawwe
Things need to be done.	Dingen moatte dien wurde.
His wife is here with him.	Syn frou is hjir by him.
It's old, but it will do.	It is âld, mar it sil dwaan.
I asked her where she came from	Ik frege har wêr't se wei kaam
He died well.	Hy stoar goed.
I bought it just a few weeks ago.	Ik kocht it krekt in pear wike lyn.
I had enough to get out of town.	Ik hie genôch om út 'e stêd te kommen.
He's on free.	Hy is op frij.
He wanted to hurt her.	Hy woe har sear dwaan.
Take this off now.	Nim dit no ôf.
It was both together, or nothing.	It wiene beide tegearre, of neat.
A little at a time, of course	In bytsje op in tiid, fansels
I wanted to go to school	Ik woe nei skoalle
I think it's the same for her	Ik tink dat it itselde is foar har
I can get the money, no problem.	Ik kin it jild krije, gjin probleem.
You go to the police.	Jo geane nei de plysje.
They would never tell me.	Se soene it my noait fertelle.
I should say dad and mom now	Ik soe no heit en mem sizze moatte
I can no longer be there	Ik kin der net mear wêze
I never wanted to see my mother again	Ik woe myn mem noait wer sjen
Now everything goes.	No giet alles.
It was never quite right.	It wie noait hielendal goed.
Of course they play like that too.	Se spylje fansels ek sa.
Something needs to be done.	Der moat wat dien wurde.
I wish this would all go away	Ik woe dat dit alles fuort soe
I want that too.	Dat wol ik ek.
I do not know who anymore.	Ik wit net mear wa.
I know who did it to you too	Ik wit wa't it dy ek dien hat
I agreed with him	Ik wie it mei him iens
He knew the city.	Hy koe de stêd.
They were so happy.	Se wiene sa bliid.
I did not want you to be scared	Ik woe net dat jo bang wiene
It's been three days.	Trije dagen is it west.
You can be sure of that.	Jo kinne der wis fan wêze.
I want to do this for you	Ik wol dit foar dy dwaan
In fact, he looked nice today.	Eins seach er der hjoed aardich út.
Do what you think is right.	Doch wat jo goed tinke.
But nobody says that.	Mar nimmen seit dat.
I'll show you everything	Ik sil dy alles sjen litte
Tell her what you are doing before you do it.	Fertel har wat jo dogge foardat jo it dogge.
I need to talk to her too	Ik moat ek mei har prate
Everyone who came here, everyone wants the same thing.	Elkenien dy't hjir kaam, elkenien wol itselde.
I think she had bought them	Ik tink dat se se kocht hie
Just like my wife's name.	Krekt as de namme fan myn frou.
I will never see them again.	Ik sil se noait wer sjen.
I'm going, of course.	Ik gean fansels.
Well, do that.	No, doch dat.
I looked away from him	Ik seach fan him ôf
I must have heard enough talk	Ik hie wol genôch praat heard
I knew he was up to something.	Ik wist dat hy wat oan 'e hân wie.
I only know one way to do it.	Ik wit mar ien manier om it te dwaan.
There are some things you can do.	D'r binne wat dingen dy't jo dwaan kinne.
I obviously knew better.	Ik wist fansels better.
We had food a few times.	Wy hawwe in pear kear iten hân.
We had a plan.	Wy hiene in plan.
I need to know things he said	Ik moat dingen witte dy't hy sei
It could be her.	It kin har wêze.
Join me to admit how difficult it is.	Doch mei my oan om ta te jaan hoe dreech it is.
I did not like it too much	Ik haw it net al te goed hân
Which of course it was.	Wat it fansels wie.
That was how the problems started.	Dat wie hoe't de problemen begûn.
A man must do what a man must do.	In man moat dwaan wat in man dwaan moat.
The water was real.	It wetter wie echt.
I have time.	Ik haw tiid.
I should have kept you with me	Ik hie dy by my hâlde moatten
That's probably wrong.	Dat is wierskynlik ferkeard.
I want her to be happy with me	Ik wol dat se bliid is mei my
If they did not, they could not agree.	As se dat net diene, koene se it net iens wêze.
I will never get better from this.	Ik sil hjir noait better fan wurde.
He's doing it right.	Hy docht it goed.
I want us to tell each other everything	Ik wol dat wy elkoar alles fertelle
They would never know what affected them.	Se soene noait witte wat har rekke.
But they do not need everything they eat.	Mar se hawwe net alles nedich wat se ite.
We're just too different.	Wy binne gewoan te oars.
The people were too into him.	De minsken wiene te yn him.
That's what we saw.	Dat hawwe wy sjoen.
I just heard the words	Ik hearde krekt de wurden
I'll look into it.	Ik sil der nei sjen.
I needed to know what he wanted	Ik moast witte wat hy woe
I just need to be with you	Ik moat gewoan by dy wêze
It's not pretty.	It is net moai.
I could stay there for hours	Ik koe dêr oeren bliuwe
I was surprised when she did not	Ik wie ferrast doe't se dat net die
He stayed at work.	Hy bleau oan it wurk.
Could be wrong.	Kin ferkeard wêze.
I would love to work with you	Ik wol graach mei dy wurkje
It was still pretty early.	It wie noch frij betiid.
I never had a picture of her	Ik hie noait in foto fan har
I know that right away	Dat wit ik fuort
And maybe even fun.	En miskien sels leuk.
You already know that it does no good.	Jo witte al dat it gjin goed docht.
I asked her about her day	Ik frege har oer har dei
I thought nothing of it at first.	Ik tocht der earst neat fan.
I will not tell him that	Dat sil ik him net sizze
To have and not to have.	Te hawwen en net hawwe.
I know you will do it all for our people	Ik wit dat jo it allegear sille dwaan foar ús minsken
How has a man become what he is today.	Hoe is in man wurden wat er hjoed is.
I did not want to wait and chance it	Ik woe net wachtsje en kâns it
Not from my mother.	Net fan myn mem.
We did it.	Wy hawwe it dien.
I was not exactly sure	Ik wie der net krekt wis fan
He wondered where it was now.	Hy frege him ôf wêr't it no wie.
I'm so glad you're here with me	Ik bin sa bliid dat jo hjir by my binne
She would have been a beautiful girl.	Se soe in moai famke west hawwe.
I had no idea you could do this.	Ik hie gjin idee dat jo dit dwaan koene.
I would like to know what was going on.	Ik mocht graach witte wat der oan de hân wie.
The last words she heard from you were kind.	De lêste wurden dy't se fan jo hearde wiene aardich.
It's so long.	It is sa lang.
I had never had such a thing before.	Ik hie noch noait sa'n ding hân.
He had just found her.	Hy hie har krekt fûn.
I was already running	Ik rûn al oan
That bit was good.	Dat bytsje wie goed.
I want to work.	Ik wol wurkje.
All of this may be too obvious to say.	Dit alles kin te dúdlik wêze om te sizzen.
However, you should not have done it.	Hoe dan ek, jo moatte it net dien hawwe.
He has a lot to do.	Hy hat in protte te dwaan.
I should have known she would not be	Ik hie witte moatten dat se net wêze soe
This went on and on and on.	Dit gie troch en troch en troch.
Just wrong for me.	Krekt ferkeard foar my.
It's easy to see that holds.	It is maklik te sjen dat hâldt.
I have to be very careful	Ik moat hiel foarsichtich wêze
I liked everything we did	Ik mocht fan alles wat wy diene
I do not want to see them do that anymore.	Ik wol se dat net mear dwaan sjen.
Also see if you can get me a room there.	Sjoch ek oft jo my dêr in keamer krije kinne.
That would not be possible.	Dat soe net kinne.
I want you to do exactly what you want	Ik wol dat jo krekt dogge wat jo wolle
I want to be your friend	ik wol dyn freon wêze
That's what I found.	Dat fûn ik.
I did not know about that	Dêr wist ik net fan
I only saw her a few times	Ik seach har mar in pear kear
He would tell her the same thing if he told me.	Hy soe har itselde fertelle as hy my fertelde.
I was all but, really	Ik wie alles mar, echt
That's me for the day.	Dat bin ik foar de dei.
But that did not have to do.	Mar dat hoegde net te dwaan.
We just love people.	Wy hâlde gewoan fan minsken.
You have to try it, just do it.	Jo moatte it besykje, doch it gewoan.
I was sure there were only two	Ik wie der wis fan dat der mar twa wiene
I can see that no one has	Ik kin sjen dat gjinien hat
Good.	Goed.
That did not happen.	Dat die it net.
I know everyone wants to know	Ik wit dat elkenien wol witte
This they did not expect.	Dit hiene se net ferwachte.
She expected it from us.	Se ferwachte it fan ús.
I want to know why you did this	Ik wol witte wêrom jo dit dien hawwe
We can better find a way to get out.	Wy kinne better in manier fine om út te kommen.
Of course her husband knows.	Fansels wit har man.
How to do it ?.	Hoe it te dwaan ?.
I know how tired you must be	Ik wit hoe wurch jo wêze moatte
I hope to come back one day.	Ik hoopje op in dei werom te kommen.
And this time, you have to give it your all.	En dizze kear moatte jo jo jaan.
I could not go away, not yet	Ik koe net fuort, noch net
But it will be too late then.	Mar it sil dan te let wêze.
But there will never be a reason.	Mar der sil nea in reden wêze.
I can do nothing more myself	Ik kin neat mear sels dwaan
If it is not, it should be.	As it net is, moat it wêze.
I saw it as a movie	Ik seach it as in film
Not as long as last time, mind you.	Net sa lang as de lêste kear, tink.
I was exactly the same.	Ik wie krekt itselde.
I no longer know who she is	Ik wit net mear wa't se is
Maybe he just wants to make sure you stay tonight.	Miskien wol er gewoan soargje dat jo fannacht bliuwe.
I just never got around to it	Ik kaam der gewoan noait oan
He did not say how much it would be.	Hy sei net hoefolle it wêze soe.
I've been waiting a very long time	Ik wachte al hiel lang
He should have known better, really.	Hy hie better witte moatten, echt.
What has ever been done to me.	Wat my oait dien is.
I could never have a better friend than you	Ik koe noait in bettere freon hawwe as jo
I have done some work on this.	Ik haw dien wat wurk oan dit.
I had never looked so beautiful before	Ik hie noch noait sa moai sjoen
I heard it a lot lately	Ik hearde it de lêste tiid in protte
And not just mine.	En net allinnich myn.
It makes us think about each other.	It lit ús tinke oer elkoar.
I think he's wrong.	Ik tink dat hy is ferkeard.
i never.	ik nea.
I really want a new one	Ik wol echt in nije
When you eat, eat.	As jo ​​ite, yt.
I have no place to go when home	Ik haw gjin plak om te gean as thús
I talked to your mother.	Ik haw mei dyn mem praat.
I would not try to make anything	Ik soe net besykje wat te meitsjen
I will never let that happen	Ik sil it noait barre litte
I will think for you from time to time.	Ik sil by en troch foar dy tinke.
I went in once.	Ik gie eartiids yn.
We are happy when everything goes well with us.	Wy binne bliid as alles goed giet mei ús.
I want to make things right	Ik wol dingen goed meitsje
I could also tell she was scared	Ik koe ek fertelle dat se bang wie
Both are good with me.	Beide is goed by my.
I hope he's done talking	Ik hoopje dat er klear is mei praten
You and no one else.	Jo en gjinien oars.
I have to think of them as food	Ik moat se tinke as iten
Who else sees this ?.	Wa oars sjocht dit?.
This is getting bad.	Dit wurdt min.
I felt so bad about it too	Ik fielde my der ek sa min oer
In and out and away.	Yn en út en fuort.
But she was not beautiful, it was clear.	Mar se wie net moai, it wie dúdlik.
An idea came to her.	Der kaam in idee by har.
I did not have much time with my family today	Ik hie hjoed net folle tiid mei myn famylje
But that seems to be what happened.	Mar dat liket te wêzen wat der bard is.
You will not let this thing come over you.	Jo sille dit ding net oer jo komme litte.
It's one reason we're so scared.	It is ien reden dat wy sa bang binne.
I would buy this again and again and again	Ik soe keapje dit wer en wer en wer
I hope you both come back.	Ik hoopje dat jo beide werom komme.
I was not yet ready to deal with such a one	Ik wie noch net ree om mei sa'n ien om te gean
I just can not say for sure	Ik kin gewoan net foar wis sizze
It did not seem to do much.	It like net folle út te dwaan.
It will not be so real.	It sil net sa echt wêze.
She knew of him.	Se wist fan him.
She did not see him.	Se seach him net.
I just knew someone had seen me	Ik wist krekt dat immen my sjoen hie
Nothing would happen tonight, she thought.	Der soe fannacht neat barre, tocht se.
I was still so tired	Ik wie noch sa wurch
You will do what you have to.	Jo sille dwaan wat jo moatte.
I feel that this is not necessary	Ik fiel dat dat net nedich is
It may still come first.	It kin noch wol earst komme.
They come they do not know why.	Se komme se witte net wêrom.
Maybe it was too good.	Miskien wie it te goed.
I know where you're going to school	Ik wit wêr't jo nei skoalle gean
He could do that.	Dat koe er dwaan.
But of course she did not.	Mar dat hie se fansels net.
I know it should not have, but it did	Ik wit dat it net hie moatten, mar it die
She knew better than to say anything.	Se wist better as wat te sizzen.
I was not sure what to say at the meeting	Ik wie net wis wat ik soe sizze op 'e gearkomste
It was so easy to be nice to him.	It wie sa maklik om aardich foar him te wêzen.
I need to do a few things	Ik moat in pear dingen dwaan
We are too.	Wy binne ek.
We must not let this happen.	Wy moatte dit net barre litte.
Whatever you believe, it's gone.	Wat jo ek leauwe, it is fuort.
I do not know his name	Ik wit syn namme net
So it is no more.	Sa is it net mear.
I did not want to talk about it here	Ik woe it hjir net oer ha
And much more.	En noch folle mear.
You did not have the idea.	Jo hawwe it idee net hân.
I liked the baby.	Ik mocht fan it bern.
Nothing to be afraid of.	Neat om bang foar te wêzen.
I was no longer scared	Ik wie net mear bang
Everything was true, of course.	Alles wie wier, fansels.
My father is not like that.	Myn heit is net sa.
You just can not.	Jo kinne gewoan net.
They do not want us.	Se wolle ús net.
Not exactly sure how much.	Net krekt wis hoefolle.
They were not really about anything.	Se wiene net echt oer neat.
I looked at it for a long time	Ik seach der lang nei
I would love to take you out.	Ik soe graach nimme dy út.
I thought everything would be better	Ik tocht dat alles better wêze soe
What is the.	Wat is de.
I thought she felt the same	Ik tocht dat se itselde fielde
I think they probably have problems	Ik tink dat se wierskynlik problemen hawwe
I was so worried about you	Ik makke my safolle soargen oer dy
That never happens to me.	Dat bart noait foar my.
He has had enough.	Hy hat genôch hân.
I'll do this thing	Ik sil dit ding dwaan
After this, not so much.	Nei dit, net sa folle.
I could not believe he wanted me	Ik koe net leauwe dat hy my woe
She did not do it often.	Se die it net faak.
We do not want to do that.	Dat wolle wy net dwaan.
Never never again.	Nea nea wer.
You have no food.	Jo hawwe gjin iten.
He did not want to hurt anyone.	Hy woe gjinien sear dwaan.
I heard them clearly.	Ik hearde se dúdlik.
It was never hit.	It wie nea rekke.
That we would do things for him.	Dat wy soene dingen foar him dwaan.
But there was no clear plan.	Mar der wie gjin dúdlik plan.
I am of everything that has come to me	Ik bin fan alles wat foar my kommen is
No one is doing it yet.	Noch gjinien docht it.
I did, he thought.	Ik die, tocht er.
He was too old to quit.	Hy wie te âld om op te hâlden.
I looked back at her	Ik seach nei har werom
I tried one last time	Ik besocht in lêste kear
She could not get it.	Se koe it net krije.
I'm in the office.	Ik bin op it kantoar.
I can 't have a problem with that.	Ik kin der gjin probleem yn.
I did not really know that	Dat wist ik eins net
I love her, she loves me	Ik hâld fan har, se hâldt fan my
I was just too sick.	Ik wie gewoan te siik.
They must be old.	Se moatte âld wêze.
I will not cause you any problems.	Ik sil jo gjin problemen meitsje.
This posed a problem.	Dit joech in probleem.
She had done it.	Se hie it dien.
Need a hand.	In hân nedich.
I think what you did had to be done	Ik tink dat wat jo dien hawwe, dien wurde moast
I told her it was very nice	Ik fertelde har dat it heul moai wie
I will never see her again	Ik sil har noait wer sjen
Your day will come.	Jo dei sil komme.
On on on.	Oan op oan.
It all comes on time.	It komt allegear op 'e tiid.
And she can not find a man.	En se kin gjin man fine.
You can see them.	Jo kinne se sjen.
As if she.	As wie se.
I could ask him about his parents.	Ik koe him freegje oer syn âlden.
We were nothing out.	Wy wiene neat út.
I'm afraid to give them back	Ik bin bang se werom te jaan
Of course, we cannot be the same.	Fansels kinne wy ​​net itselde wurde.
I really hope so.	Dat hoopje ik echt.
They talk to someone.	Se prate mei immen.
But this is simply not the truth.	Mar dit is gewoan net de wierheid.
I would love to go back with you.	Ik soe graach werom mei dy.
I will not show her this letter	Ik sil har dit brief net sjen litte
But last night, this last time, she had to.	Mar fannacht, dizze lêste kear, moast se.
I would love to help you	Ik soe graach jo help
I have a house and a car	Ik haw in hûs en in auto
This girl had no hand.	Dit famke hie gjin hân.
Well, it's about money too.	Goed, it giet ek om jild.
I did not want her to know about my family.	Ik woe net dat se wist oer myn famylje.
I'm never alone in anything	Ik bin noait allinnich yn neat
I have to take care of them, it's my job.	Ik moat foar har soargje, it is myn wurk.
I will stay here	Ik sil hjir bliuwe
I'm a good man. 	Ik bin in goed man. 
Not in my name.	Net op myn namme.
You make friends.	Jo meitsje freonen.
I have enough time to get there	Ik ha genôch tiid om dêr te kommen
I love my friends and family	Ik hâld fan myn freonen en famylje
You want to scare them.	Jo wolle har bang meitsje.
I should not have even thought about it	Ik hie it net iens tinke moatten
If you want that, you do not go out.	As jo ​​dat wolle, gean jo net út.
We stay until tomorrow, then we go inside.	Wy bliuwe oant moarn, dan geane wy ​​yn.
I can not wait to read much more from you	Ik kin net wachtsje om folle mear fan jo te lêzen
I put myself in his place	Ik sette my op syn plak
They got their min.	Se krige se min.
He was ready.	Hy wie klear.
I had thought it would be so.	Ik hie tocht dat it sa wêze soe.
I love how everyone works.	Ik hâld fan hoe't elkenien wurket.
She also looked somewhat surprised.	Se seach ek wat ferrast.
She would be my friend.	Se soe myn freon wêze.
Playing on itself is fun.	Spylje op himsels is leuk.
He remained there until his death.	Hy bleau dêr oant er stoar.
I had no idea how much	Ik hie gjin idee hoefolle
It's there or it's not.	It is der of it is net.
I think they were more than afraid of them	Ik tink dat se mear as wat foar har bang wiene
I knew where she was going	Ik wist wêr't se hinne wie
I know he wants to go back.	Ik wit dat hy werom wol.
I only spoke to her once this week	Ik haw dizze wike mar ien kear mei har praat
The question is difficult.	De fraach is dreech.
I still knew it, as if it had happened yesterday	Ik wist it noch, as wie it juster bard
Well, we have to be careful here.	No, wy moatte hjir foarsichtich wêze.
I could not find any words yet	Ik koe noch gjin wurden fine
He's there now.	Hy is der no.
But it was not her.	Mar it wie har net.
I've told you that before	Dat haw ik dy earder sein
I've never seen her so happy	Ik haw har noch noait sa bliid sjoen
I walked into the place	Ik rûn it plak yn
Just out of school.	Krekt út skoalle.
I want someone who can talk to me	Ik wol ien dy't mei my prate kin
I knew the day would come	Ik wist dat de dei komme soe
I do not want to think anything.	Ik wol neat tinke.
I feel more with you.	Ik fiel my mear by dy.
They said many things.	Se seine in protte dingen.
I hope you will come to me again.	Ik hoopje dat jo my wer komme sille.
He knew what he wanted.	Hy wist wat er woe.
We're leaving tomorrow.	Wy geane moarn fuort.
No holding back.	Gjin hâlden werom.
I do not want you to worry about me.	Ik wol net dat jo jo soargen meitsje oer my.
I'm not scared at all.	Ik bin hielendal net bang.
We take and.	Wy nimme en.
It was not quite the same.	It wie net hielendal itselde.
The only thing to do was wait for him.	It ienige wat te dwaan wie op him wachtsje.
I wanted nothing from him or from anyone	Ik woe neat fan him of fan ien
I'm a woman.	Ik bin in frou.
I thought you were just angry	Ik tocht dat jo gewoan lilk wiene
I need to look into it more	Ik moat der mear nei sjen
And so it is.	En dat is it sa.
They are trying to help you do it.	Se besykje jo te helpen it te dwaan.
We're at the movie.	Wy binne by de film.
I wish more people do that	Ik winskje dat mear minsken dat dogge
Even he seems kind.	Sels liket him soarte.
Then we stay or go.	Dan bliuwe wy of gean.
I think he's fine	Ik tink dat hy goed komt
I also had to get ready for work	Ik moast my ek klear meitsje foar it wurk
I'm leaving soon.	Ik bin gau fuort.
Or maybe it came from her.	Of miskien kaam it út har.
There was something wrong with this man.	Der wie wat net goed oan dizze man.
And they do a lot.	En se dogge in protte.
I should not have been here	Ik hie hjir net wêze moatten
The police were there.	De plysje wie der.
She found that she would love her too.	Se fûn dat se ek fan har hâlde soe.
It's very beautiful.	It is hiel moai.
I should have seen something.	Ik hie wat sjen moatten.
He was obviously not there.	Hy wie der fansels net.
I just needed the money	Ik hie gewoan it jild nedich
I actually think all mine	Ik eins tink dat al myn
I feel better now.	Ik fiel my no better.
I had nothing real	Ik hie neat echt
I do not think it should do that.	Ik tink net dat it dat moat dwaan.
I totally agree with that	Dêr bin ik it hielendal mei iens
I need to talk to you.	Ik moat mei dy prate.
I will not even look at you	Ik sil net iens nei dy sjen
This was much more.	Dit wie folle mear.
Really this time.	Echt dizze kear.
You asked for it.	Do hast der om frege.
He really had to think what he was doing.	Hy moast echt tinke wat er die.
I could almost see us there	Ik koe ús der noch hast sjen
I knew there would be no one	Ik wist dat d'r gjinien wêze soe
I had nothing to do with it	Ik hie der neat oan
Get out of there alive.	Gean der libben út.
I've been here since that time	Ik bin hjir sûnt dy tiid
I did not feel it.	Ik fielde it net.
.	.
With a little to do.	Mei in bytsje te dwaan.
She had hurt him and she was happy.	Se hie him sear dien en se wie bliid.
But come here.	Mar kom hjir hinne.
But then you have to show it.	Mar dan moatte jo dat sjen litte.
That I should have tried.	Dat hie ik besykje moatten.
She always treated me like something else.	Se hat my altyd as wat oars.
You will need him now.	Jo sille him no nedich hawwe.
We could do nothing but wait.	Wy koene neat dwaan as wachtsje.
I'm always tired, so tired	Ik bin altyd wurch, sa wurch
I can not do that yet.	Dat kin ik noch net.
She liked her work.	Se mocht har wurk graach.
I just wanted to know more about you.	Ik woe gewoan mear oer dy witte.
I did not even feel like one	Ik fielde my net iens as ien
He would get nothing from her again.	Hy soe wer neat fan har krije.
And this time we will do well.	En dizze kear sille wy it goed dwaan.
We are not going to go anywhere.	Wy binne net fan plan om nei wêr te gean.
I know it takes a lot of time	Ik wit dat it in protte tiid hat
I do not see how you can say otherwise.	Ik sjoch net hoe't jo oars sizze kinne.
I knew this was my chance	Ik wist dat dit myn kâns wie
They are one and the same.	Se binne ien en itselde.
I can not see the door	Ik kin de doar net sjen
I'm gone for tomorrow.	Ik bin foar moarn fuort.
I think we knew this	Ik tink dat wy dit wisten
I can not help but worry	Ik kin net oars as soargen
I can not seem to take it all in stride	Ik kin it lykje net alles yn te nimmen
Not looking back yet.	Sjocht noch net werom.
That was not her.	Dat wie se net.
I knew this place was not for her	Ik wist dat dit plak net foar har wie
But it's better than anything else.	Mar it is better as wat oars.
I just wish you had told me sooner	Ik woe gewoan dat jo my earder ferteld hiene
You help people.	Jo helpe minsken.
I need to get him off of me	Ik moat him fan my ôf krije
I never knew where he came from	Ik wist noait wêr't er wei kaam
That's a lot of help.	Dat is in protte help.
This made her ta.	Dit makke har ta.
You stay for food of course.	Jo bliuwe fansels foar it iten.
Or eat before you go.	Of ite foardat jo gean.
I cared for no one else	Ik seach nimmen oars om
I did not know who the father was	Ik wist net wa't de heit wie
I give back through you	Ik jou werom troch dy
There's nothing you can do about it.	D'r is neat dat jo dwaan kinne.
The first is a woman.	De earste is in frou.
I think it's in everyone	Ik tink dat it yn elkenien is
I could never hope to be	Ik koe nea hoopje te wêzen
I need to talk to the woman	Ik moat mei de frou prate
I'm still not sure why this was	Ik bin noch net wis wêrom dit wie
Neither.	Ek net.
If you do not want to take, do not take.	As jo ​​​​net nimme wolle, nim dan net.
Do the same job.	Itselde wurk dwaan.
Do not let him come to me.	Lit him net by my komme.
He was sure she did.	Hy wie der wis fan dat se it die.
You know you love them.	Jo witte dat jo fan har hâlde.
I just felt that school was really not for me	Ik fûn gewoan dat skoalle echt net foar my wie
I know that everything that happens is true	Ik wit dat alles wat bart wier is
Well, maybe he would not want it now.	No, miskien soe er it no net wolle.
I can find another job there	Ik kin dêr in oare baan fine
Maybe he can still talk him out of here.	Miskien kin er him hjir noch út prate.
I myself have had enough	Ik sels haw genôch hân
You talked to him.	Do hast mei him praat.
We love our work.	Wy hâlde fan ús wurk.
I'm so sorry, Mom	It spyt my sa, mem
I went away whether he liked it or not	Ik gie fuort, oft er it leuk fûn of net
I thought someone was in big trouble	Ik tocht dat immen yn grutte problemen siet
Class has nothing to do with it.	Klasse hat der neat mei te krijen.
I never wanted what happened to your family	Ik woe noait wat der mei jo famylje barde
And he does not.	En dat docht er net.
I would say to anyone out there.	Ik soe sizze tsjin immen út dêr.
He said he would wait.	Hy sei dat er wachtsje soe.
I never got to talk to him about it	Ik krige der noait mei him oer te praten

I wanted to be able to say it	Ik woe it sizze kinne
Three more days, he thought.	Noch trije dagen, tocht er.
I do not know what has become of her words.	Ik wit net wat der fan har wurden is.
I walked into his office and he just knew	Ik rûn yn syn kantoar en hy wist gewoan
I did not want more	Ik woe net mear
I did not want to know	Ik woe it net witte
We can not know.	Wy kinne it net witte.
I had no idea what she was talking about.	Ik hie gjin idee wêr't se it oer hie.
It was now a week ago.	It wie no in wike lyn.
I know people want to do what they want	Ik wit dat minsken wolle dwaan wat se wolle
I wish you could see them.	Ik winskje dat jo har sjen kinne.
I can actually try to keep these	Ik kin eins besykje dizze te hâlden

I walked her to the door	Ik rûn har nei de doar
I need to be more.	Ik moat mear wêze.
I do not know how they knew so quickly	Ik wit net hoe't se sa gau wisten
Do one, a few, or all.	Doch ien, in pear, of allegear.

That happened to me a few times.	Dat barde my in pear kear.
I do not believe this will happen	Ik leau net dat dit barre sil
I asked only two things	Ik frege mar twa dingen
No one will do our work for us	Nimmen sil ús wurk foar ús dwaan
I'm really sick.	Ik bin echt siik.
He had nothing.	Hy hie neat.
Well, they have mine.	No, se hawwe myn.
Then again, maybe they play it there differently.	Dan wer, miskien spylje se it dêr oars.
Enough for now.	Genôch foar no.
Get out of there.	Gean der út.
He had never seen them before.	Hy hie se noch noait earder sjoen.
I could look at it	Ik koe der nei sjen
They are not ready.	Se binne net klear.
But we are not going back.	Mar wy geane net werom.

It's not the place you want to be.	It is net it plak wêr't jo wêze wolle.
I do not do it anymore	Ik doch it net mear
You must come with me now.	Jo moatte no mei my komme.
Of course, I was not happy about that	Dêr wie ik fansels net bliid mei

There is no coming around this.	Der is gjin komme om dit.
I think it was not so long ago	Ik tink dat it net sa lang lyn wie
To tell me she loves me	Om my te fertellen dat se fan my hâlde

We did not try.	Wy hawwe net besocht.
I never would have thought he would be like that	Ik soe noait tocht hawwe dat hy sa wêze soe

I have never heard of this before and had no idea.	Ik haw noch noait earder heard fan dit en hie gjin idee.
Of course, this will never happen.	Fansels sil dit noait barre.

That is very clear.	Dat is hiel dúdlik.
I want to believe in people	Ik wol yn minsken leauwe

If not, you can see how I do it.	Sa net, dan kinne jo sjen hoe ik it dwaan.
I did not like to make trouble	Ik woe net graach problemen meitsje
I do not believe he did what he seems to have done.	Ik leau net dat hy dien hat wat er dien liket te hawwen.
You do not want to do that.	Dat wolle jo net dwaan.
It could really be one of us	It koe echt ien fan ús wêze
It was never clear where this idea came from.	It wie nea dúdlik wêr't dit idee wei kaam.
You need all three.	Jo moatte alle trije.
I have some things for you	Ik haw wat dingen foar dy
I do not want such a dog.	Ik wol net sa'n hûn.
Everything my dad made.	Alles wat myn heit makke.
I'll see what we can do	Ik sil sjen wat wy kinne dwaan
It will keep you going.	It sil dy hâlde.
I had no idea he was coming	Ik hie gjin idee dat hy komme soe
She does not know anything about.	Se wit net wat oer.
Forever and ever.	Foar altyd en altyd.
Not getting enough water.	Net genôch wetter krije.
I also asked her to come through if she wanted	Ik frege har ek om troch te kommen as se woe
So he lived with his mother.	Sa wenne er by syn mem.
Nobody heard anything.	Nimmen hat wat heard.
Very few things actually need to be done.	Hiel pear dingen moatte eins dien wurde.
I went with him to the	Ik gie mei him nei de
Okay, a little.	Goed, in bytsje.
But it's enough.	Mar it is genôch.
Otherwise they would.	Oars soene se.
He did not look back.	Hy seach net werom.
He needs us now more than ever.	Hy hat ús no mear nedich as ea.
I had not really thought about that	Dêr hie ik eins net oan tocht
I would have done it	Ik soe it dien hawwe
I saw him so clearly	Ik seach him sa dúdlik
I will never get anything done.	Ik sil noait wat dien krije.
Same as it ever was.	Itselde as it ea wie.
All we did was help him finish it	Alles wat wy diene wie him helpe om it ôf te meitsjen
Never again.	Nea wat mear.
A new day is upon you.	In nije dei stiet foar jo iepen.
But he was not good at it.	Mar hy wie der net goed yn.
They want it they get it.	Se wolle it se krije it.
My first home.	Myn earste thús.
Well, we know why.	No, wy witte wêrom.
You stay out of the way.	Jo bliuwe út 'e wei.
They are both good.	Se binne beide goed.
It wanted to show me.	It woe my sjen litte.
I did not go every day	Ik gie net alle dagen
When it comes.	As it komt.
I wanted to tell him, so bad	Ik woe it him sizze, sa min
Maybe he should.	Miskien moast er.
I know what this is about.	Ik wit wêr't dit oer giet.
Something had to happen.	Der moast wat barre.
I had it with him	Ik haw it mei him hân
I did, a lot.	Ik die, in protte.
I feel like it should have been maybe	Ik fiel dat it miskien wêze moatten hie
He did not want us.	Hy woe ús net.
She had no idea, really, what it was.	Se hie gjin idee, echt, wat it wie.
It would be so easy.	It soe sa maklik wêze.
Let them leave here.	Lit se hjir litte.
I was talking about you	Ik hie it oer dy
I know your mother would not	Ik wit dat dyn mem net soe
I do not believe he knew what he was doing	Ik leau net dat hy wist wat er die
I could not think of anyone else	Ik koe net oan immen oars tinke
Just take it out of the house.	Nim it gewoan út 'e hûs.
I was so happy	Ik wie sa bliid
I did not want either	Ik woe net ien fan beide
It's bad faith.	It is min leauwe.
I have to ask to be sure of that	Ik moat freegje om der wis fan te wêzen
I wish she stayed that way.	Ik woe dat se sa bleau.
Those are all problems.	Dat binne allegear problemen.
I had a bad day yesterday	Ik hie juster in minne dei
No one can see or find me here.	Nimmen kin my hjir sjen of fine.
Hope you do too.	Hoopje do ek.
I had to go though.	Ik moast wol gean.
I would also really like to be your friend	Ik soe ek echt graach dyn freon wêze wolle
I just need a little help	Ik haw gewoan in bytsje help nedich
I will not buy them from you	Ik sil se net fan jo keapje
They can be real.	Se kinne echt wêze.
I admit.	Ik jou my oan.
Think about it.	Tink der oer nei.
We have you.	Wy hawwe dy.
I looked at him with interest	Ik seach him ynteressearre oan
How good is that ?.	Hoe goed is dat?.
I tried to get it to work and could not.	Ik besocht it oan it wurk te krijen en koe net.
I know for sure who you are	Ik wit wis wa't jo binne
It was everything.	It wie alles.
Everything went really well and it worked.	Alles gie echt goed en it hat wurke.
But give me time.	Mar jou my tiid.
Nothing was in its right place.	Neat wie op syn goede plak.
Can't help it.	Kin it net helpe.
I've seen through your plan	Ik haw troch jo plan sjoen
I assume that is so.	Ik nim oan dat dat sa is.
Of course, it's wrong.	Fansels is it ferkeard.
Maybe they need your help, maybe not.	Miskien hawwe se jo help nedich, miskien net.
It worked well.	It wurke goed.
I look forward to next week	Ik sjoch der nei út nei takom wike
I did not even know anything	Ik wist sels neat
By the time she got home.	Tsjin 'e tiid dat se thús kaam.
She looks through it.	Se sjocht der troch.
I can wait until tomorrow	Ik kin wachtsje oant moarn
You know it, man.	Jo witte it, man.
I think you worked with him	Ik tink dat jo mei him wurke hawwe
I week would seem like a year without him.	Ik wike soe lykje as in jier sûnder him.
I just want you to be careful	Ik wol gewoan dat jo foarsichtich binne
But not today.	Mar hjoed net.
We just do not know.	Wy witte it gewoan net.
It must be so.	It moat sa wêze.
I know she would love to talk to you	Ik wit dat se graach mei dy prate soe
I have to leave early today	Ik moat hjoed betiid fuort
I also feel like she loves him	Ik fiel ek dat se fan him hâldt
See here for how you can help !.	Sjoch hjir foar hoe't jo helpe kinne!.
I do over mine.	Ik doch oer myn.
I have not seen one the whole time we were there.	Ik haw de hiele tiid dat wy dêr wiene net ien sjoen.
A man could love a woman so much	In man koe sa folle fan in frou hâlde
Now it works.	No wurket it.
I have great friends	Ik haw grutte freonen
I've seen a lot in him	Ik haw in protte yn him sjoen
I'm not even happy.	Ik bin net iens bliid.
I did nothing wrong	Ik ha neat ferkeard dien
I thought you'd be there tonight	Ik tocht dat jo der fannacht by wêze soene
I feel really bad about it	Ik fiel my der echt min oer
I have to go to the office	Ik moat nei it kantoar
I told him about going tomorrow	Ik fertelde him oer gean moarn
The first is to talk.	De earste is om te praten.
Just for an hour.	Krekt foar in oere.
He continued.	Hy bleau troch.
I thought you wanted to be more than that	Ik tocht dat jo mear wêze wolle as dat
Maybe you tried too hard this time.	Miskien hawwe jo dizze kear te hurd besocht.
But there is something more.	Mar der is wat mear.
I think they want my money	Ik tink dat se myn jild wolle
I should never have done that	Dat hie ik noait dwaan moatten
If not for you, then for me.	As net foar dy, dan foar my.
There is no going back.	Der is gjin wei werom.
She looks too much like a boy to me.	Se liket my te folle op in jonge.
She asked if we had handled it well.	Se frege oft wy it goed hân hiene.
I wonder why he does this	Ik freegje my ôf wêrom't hy dit docht
It was time to get to work.	It wie tiid om oan it wurk te gean.
I did not talk about that, he said.	Dêr ha ik it net oer, sei er.
I'll find a way in there tomorrow	Ik sil der moarn in manier yn fine
A man does not look as tired as	In man sjocht der net sa wurch út as
That’s where the big money actually comes from.	Dêr komt eins it grutte jild wei.
A girl can not have everything	In famke kin net alles hawwe
And this is what.	En dit is wat.
You tell him he can come to me.	Jo fertelle him dat hy by my komme kin.
There is nothing here.	Hjir is neat.
I wanted to know things	Ik woe dingen witte
I soon found out it was	Ik fûn gau út dat it wie
He now knows what he is doing day in and day out.	Hy wit no wat er dei yn dei út docht.
But once a week or so, that will come in handy.	Mar ien kear yn 'e wike of sa sil dat wol goed komme.
I can not believe she's almost hit	Ik kin net leauwe dat se hast rekke is
I just know the place	Ik wit krekt it plak
Do not be late tomorrow.	Kom moarn net te let.
I became my new best friend	Ik waard myn nije bêste freon
I thought it was in place again	Ik tocht dat it wer op syn plak wie
I think we should take the chance	Ik tink dat wy de kâns nimme moatte
I was not so sure	Ik wie net sa wis
You have to make these.	Jo moatte dizze meitsje.
She will get a little better.	Se sil in bytsje better wurde.
He would not be there long.	Hy soe der net lang wêze.
I was also really angry	Ik wie ek echt lilk
I will stay with mom.	Ik sil by mem bliuwe.
If it's good.	As it goed is.
I would not have to go through this	Ik soe dit net hoege te gean
I do not know if that tells us anything	Ik wit net oft dat ús wat seit
Keep her scared.	Hâld har bang.
I do not know what happened to him.	Ik wit net wat der mei him bard is.
We did too.	Wy diene ek.
I could never take another man's life	Ik koe noait it libben fan in oare man nimme
I could see nothing more	Ik koe neat mear sjen
That's a child.	Dat is in bern.
I can not wait to see him	Ik kin net wachtsje om him te sjen
Good things happen to good people.	Goede dingen barre mei goede minsken.
This will be easy for you.	Dit sil maklik wêze foar jo.
I'm just so tired today.	Ik bin hjoed gewoan sa wurch.
Ea.	Ea.
I could never really do it	Ik koe it eins noait dwaan
The man looked up.	De man seach op.
My father looks at him, then back at me.	Myn heit sjocht him oan, dan wer nei my.
You have to think of us.	Jo moatte oan ús tinke.
If it is not from him, everyone will think it is.	As it net fan him is, sil elkenien tinke dat it is.
The whole family is doing well now.	It giet no goed mei de hiele famylje.
I met a friend yesterday	Ik moete mei in freon juster
I found him in the same place as before	Ik fûn him op itselde plak as earder
I should not have been so scared	Ik hie net sa bang wêze moatten
I also asked for one	Ik frege ek om ien
Dad would love to have her.	Heit soe har graach hawwe.
It was me, just me.	It wie my, krekt ik.
They were really good.	Se wiene echt goed.
Do not ask me that.	Freegje my dat net.
It did not do the right things.	It die net de goede dingen.
I know all about that great thing	Ik wit alles fan dat grutte ding
I hope everything goes well	Ik hoopje dat alles goed komt
If not, try to make one yourself.	As net, besykje sels ien te meitsjen.
It may be the last time he did this.	It kin de lêste kear wêze dat hy dit die.
I do not want to say it	Ik wol it net sizze
I did not care what he thought	Ik hie der neat mear om wat er tocht
I wish they were like that.	Ik winskje dat se sa wiene.
I saw you were in trouble	Ik seach dat jo yn de problemen wiene
He looked at me, just looked.	Hy seach my oan, seach gewoan.
Tell you what.	Fertel dy.
I just have to get out of there	Ik moat der mar út
I had no idea how beautiful it was	Ik hie gjin idee hoe moai it wie
It's the same at my house.	It is itselde by myn hûs.
In truth, it is not so.	Yn wierheid is it net sa.
I could not do this without you	Ik koe dit net sûnder dy dwaan
But they do not speak.	Mar se prate net.
I knew it was not necessary.	Ik wist dat it net nedich wie.
I still hope they were not over me	Ik hope noch dat se net oer my wiene
She looked at me.	Se seach nei my.
This is actually what happened to us.	Dit is eins wat ús bard is.
I love these kids.	Ik hâld fan dizze bern.
I let myself go again	Ik liet my wer gean
It is best to continue with the work at hand.	It is it bêste om troch te gean mei it wurk by de hân.
You are now ready to buy.	Jo binne no ree om te keapjen.
We talked about it.	Wy hawwe it der oer hân.
I can not do that again	Dat kin ik net wer
Of everything and anything.	Fan alles en noch wat.
And he's working now.	En hy wurket no.
It would be no money.	It soe gjin jild wêze.
I thought about it over and over again	Ik tocht der oer en wer
I do not look up to him	Ik sjoch him net op
I could show you there.	Ik koe dy dêr sjen litte.
I took them, those kids	Ik naam se, dy bern
They had two young children.	Se krigen twa jonge bern.
No one had ever asked.	Nimmen hie oait frege.
All right, she said.	Goed, sei se.
He wants to make them better.	Hy wol se better meitsje.
And you would not want that.	En dat soene jo net wolle.
Tried it out.	Besocht it út.
I'm so worried about you	Ik bin sa soargen oer dy
Not her parents'.	Net har âlden'.
He stands when he sees the man.	Hy stiet as er de man sjocht.
I could not talk to anyone about my life	Ik koe mei gjinien oer myn libben prate
That's a very long time ago.	Dat is hiel lang lyn.
It became so.	It waard sa.
Hope someone will help me.	Hoopje immen sil helpe my.
No one here is ready to help.	Gjinien hjir is ree om te helpen.
I would love to do it	Ik doch it wol graach
I know you'll never hurt me	Ik wit dat jo my noait sear dwaan soene
Not angry at all.	Hielendal net lilk.
I see now.	Ik sjoch no.
But she's not nice.	Mar se is net aardich.
I love reading about how people do things	Ik hâld fan lêzen oer hoe't minsken dingen dogge
Who wanted to tell everything, absolutely everything.	Dy't alles fertelle woe, hielendal alles.
I could see it all over again	Ik koe it allegear wer sjen
I did not want to wake him	Ik woe him net wekker meitsje
And that's the.	En dat die se.
It's about getting it done.	It giet om it dien te meitsjen.
But there are not many new ones to be found.	Mar der binne net folle nije te finen.
I can not believe this is happening again	Ik kin it net leauwe dat dit wer bart
I did nothing wrong.	Ik ha neat ferkeard dien.
Now that's all gone.	No is dat allegear fuort.
I'll tell you what she said.	Ik sil dy fertelle wat se sei.
He's still my father.	Hy is noch altyd myn heit.
That thing really happened at home.	Dat ding barde echt thús.
I do not see the way for me.	Ik sjoch de wei net foar my.
I wanted to tell you he's sick	Ik woe dy sizze dat er siik is
But things happen.	Mar dingen barre.
I asked him what he was doing and if he needed help.	Ik frege him wat hy die en as hy help nedich hie.
Day by day.	Dei foar dei.
He's leaving tomorrow.	Hy giet moarn fuort.
I want to talk about this.	Ik wol it oer dit.
They said they were trying to find him.	Se seine dat se besykje him te finen.
Do not be afraid.	Wês net bang.
Not that there was much time to eat.	Net dat der folle tiid wie om te iten.
I would be angry too	Ik soe ek lilk wêze
Finally the time has come.	Lang om let is de tiid kommen.
I feel almost bad now	Ik fiel my no hast min
Hope to see you next week.	Hoopje dy takom wike te sjen.
I want you to take it	Ik wol dat jo it nimme
I'm not making this up	Ik meitsje dit net op
You know.	Do wist.
We never do it.	Wy dogge it noait.
The old man and the old woman.	De âld man en de âld frou.
I have to be careful	Ik moat foarsichtich wêze
Often we are.	Faak binne wy.
Maybe when we's old, but what will she find of us then.	Miskien as wy âld binne, mar wat sil se dan fan ús fine.
Just tell him you're doing it.	Fertel him gewoan dat jo it dogge.
She would love this house.	Se soe fan dit hûs hâlde.
People know who you are.	Minsken witte wa't jo binne.
So had your chance.	Sa hiest dyn kâns.
Look, please look at her.	Sjoch, sjoch asjebleaft nei har.
He looked bad.	Hy seach der min út.
I myself can do nothing	Ik sels kin neat dwaan
No one was found.	Gjinien waard fûn.
I feel for her	Ik fiel my foar har
I did not even know they had one	Ik wist net iens dat se ien hiene
Across the room is a good place.	Oer de keamer is in goed plak.
I would not keep up with him anymore	Ik soe my net mear mei him ophâlde
I'm sure he looked after it.	Ik bin der wis fan dat hy der nei seach.
I had decided that this would be my last time	Ik hie besletten dat dit myn lêste kear wêze soe
I have the whole thing.	Ik haw it hiele ding.
Too scared of anything.	Te bang foar wat.
She's never been here.	Se is hjir noait.
But she does not let me through the door.	Mar se lit my net troch de doar.
But you know, it's her thing.	Mar jo witte, it is har ding.
He was three years old.	Dy wie trije jier âld.
Here it seems that this is what you are afraid of.	Hjir liket it dat it is wêr't jo bang foar binne.
There are now many people who care for us.	D'r binne no in protte minsken dy't foar ús soargje.
I love his way.	Ik hâld fan syn manier.
We are here to tell you otherwise.	Wy binne hjir om jo oars te fertellen.
I see you at dinner	Ik sjoch dy by it iten
That's not even a problem.	Dat is net iens in probleem.
I just can not find it	Ik kin it gewoan net fine
In a way, it was the only one he had.	Op in manier wie it de ienige dy't er hie.
I'm looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der sa nei út.
I think the truth would be a good place	Ik tink dat de wierheid in goed plak soe wêze
But it does not matter in any way.	Mar it makket neat út op ien of oare manier.
The likely this morning.	De wierskynlik fan dizze moarn.
I did nothing wrong	Ik haw neat ferkeard dien
His father would not let him.	Syn heit soe him net litte.
So much help needed.	Safolle help nedich.
I have heard so much about them.	Ik haw safolle oer har heard.
You only get one chance.	Jo krije mar ien kâns.
I did not need any of it	Ik hie der neat fan nedich
It was there.	It wie der.
I wanted him to be happy	Ik woe him bliid wêze
We are not the kind.	Wy binne net de soarte.
I have never seen or heard of anyone	Ik haw noait sjoen of heard fan ien
There's no telling what's in it.	D'r is gjin sizzen wat der yn sit.
I did not want to wait	Ik woe net wachtsje
But he knows it too.	Mar hy wit it ek.
I will take care of him.	Ik sil foar him soargje.
I made it myself.	Ik makke it sels.
Let's just do it.	Litte wy it mar dwaan.
Tell him you think it would be a good idea.	Fertel him dat jo tinke dat it in goed idee wêze soe.
We do not even talk.	Wy prate net iens.
I looked at her. 	Ik seach har oan. 
But even that does not happen.	Mar ek dat bart net.
This would give me something to look forward to.	Dit soe my wat jaan om nei út te sjen.
I did not even hear him speak	Ik hearde him net iens praten
I need them right now on me	Ik ha se no krekt op my nedich
I did this in the last job.	Ik die dit yn 'e lêste baan.
I got so much from her	Ik krige safolle fan har
I never go out with him	Ik gean noait mei him út
If it is not, there is nothing.	As it net is, is neat.
I've never seen you here before	Ik haw dy hjir noch net earder sjoen
I think we should see	Ik tink dat wy moatte sjen
I asked him where he got the idea	Ik frege him wêr't hy it idee krige
He enters.	Hy komt yn.
Try it!.	Besykje it!.
I wish it was true, though.	Ik winskje dat it wier wie, mar.
I have nothing to say to you, nothing, and neither.	Ik haw neat te sizzen tsjin dy, neat, en ek net.
A lot in my mind lately	In protte yn myn gedachten de lêste tiid
There was bad time for something else.	Der wie min tiid foar wat oars.
She did not hear.	Se hearde net.
I did not see who it was	Ik seach net wa't it wie
I do not know what else it could be.	Ik wit net wat it oars wêze kin.
I want to make this work	Ik wol dit wurk meitsje
And so it is forever.	En sa is it foar altyd.
Neither did anything wrong.	Gjin fan beide die wat ferkeard.
Maybe not even then.	Miskien sels dan net.
I'm getting pretty good at it	Ik wurd der aardich goed yn
He saw everyone.	Hy seach elkenien.
I need your help	Ik haw jo help nedich
It's that it shows he can.	It is dat it lit sjen dat hy kin.
I do not let them win.	Ik lit se net winne.
I think we never really asked.	Ik tink dat wy nea echt frege.
But no worries there.	Mar gjin soargen dêr.
It will go better.	It sil better gean.
We had only done three before.	Wy hiene mar ea trije dien.
Or both.	Of beide.
I did not want to talk	Ik woe net prate
I woke up early in the morning and they were gone	Ik waard fan 'e moarn betiid wekker en se wiene fuort
Now nothing again.	No wer neat.
I see no problem with that.	Ik sjoch dêr gjin probleem mei.
They're still around.	Se komme noch altyd om.
Friend for his work.	Freon foar syn wurk.
I acted like they knew everything	Ik die as wisten se alles
No one has.	Gjinien hat.
He wants to go back to a good man.	Hy wol werom nei in goede man.
I should not have to wait for him	Ik soe him net wachtsje litte moatte
I would not even doubt	Ik soe net iens twifelje
We do not want to hurt you.	Wy wolle jo net sear dwaan.
It does not have to be this way.	It hoecht net sa te wêzen.
Come to us.	Kom nei ús ta.
He knew what we would find here.	Hy wist wat wy hjir fine soene.
I would not be able to	Ik soe net kinne
I thought he might have been away for the evening	Ik tocht dat er miskien fuort west hie foar de jûn
The new kind, not so much.	De nije soarte, net sa folle.
I did not expect anyone to be in my room	Ik hie net ferwachte dat ien yn myn keamer soe wêze
I do not agree with him here	Ik bin it hjir net mei him iens
Please let me know if there is anything else you should see.	Lit my asjebleaft witte as d'r wat oars is dat jo moatte sjen.
I felt sure we would not make it	Ik fielde wis dat wy it net soene meitsje
I was angry much of the day.	Ik wie lilk in protte fan 'e dei.
It was not very nice.	It wie net hiel moai.
I just need to know what was found	Ik moat gewoan witte wat fûn is
A great guy who works hard	In grutte keardel dy't hurd wurket
I have to do it my way.	Ik moat it op myn manier dwaan.
I can get us there, no problem	Ik kin ús dêr krije, gjin probleem
Hope you do more.	Hoopje dat jo mear dogge.
You know it, you know it.	Jo witte it, jo witte it.
It gave me another reason to be angry.	It joech my noch in reden om lilk te wêzen.
We do not want them	Wy wolle se net
And he never did anything after that	En hy die nea neat nei
I'm so happy for you	Ik bin sa bliid foar dy
No one knew where he came from.	Nimmen wist wêr't er wei kaam.
It's just not true.	It is gewoan net wier.
Now they were as ready as they ever would be.	No wiene se sa klear as se oait wêze soene.
Could not do it.	Koe it net dwaan.
And you can better see here what he likes.	En jo kinne hjir better sjen wat er him hâldt.
We need much more and we need it now.	Wy hawwe folle mear nedich en wy hawwe it no nedich.
With a new wife.	Mei in nije frou.
I agreed, but was so scared.	Ik wie it iens, mar wie sa bang.
But, there was none.	Mar, der wie gjinien.
I should have been there for her	Ik hie der foar har wêze moatten
I did not think of that	Ik tocht der net oan
I can be anything you want me to be	Ik kin alles wêze wat jo wolle dat ik bin
It was a good plan.	It wie in goed plan.
I want you to enjoy it here	Ik wol dat jo it hjir leuk fine
I met this great girl	Ik moete dit grutte famke
I've never thought of it before.	Ik ha der noch net iens earder oan tocht.
You will see them before you go.	Jo sille har sjen foardat jo geane.
I have never met anyone like her.	Ik haw noch noait ien as har moete.
I really do not believe in this kind of thing	Ik leau echt net yn dit soarte dingen
Not many could do that.	Net folle koene dat dwaan.
I have never met any of them	Ik haw noait ien fan har moete
We are all ready to help you.	Wy binne allegear ree om jo te helpen.
I have no idea why they would do this	Ik haw gjin idee wêrom't se dit soene dwaan
I wish there was time to make it all right	Ik winskje dat der tiid wie om it allegear goed te meitsjen
It will still take time	It sil noch tiid nedich wêze
I never wanted to be a father	Ik woe noait heit wurde
I was still very angry	Ik wie noch tige lilk
We all have things we like and dislike.	Wy hawwe allegear dingen dy't wy leuk fine en net leuk fine.
They know where each other is going.	Se witte wêr't elkoar hinne gean.
I so much needed someone to talk to	Ik hie sa folle nedich immen om mei te praten
Has one child.	Hat ien bern.
I knew he could and would do that	Ik wist dat hy dat koe en soe dwaan
I have one now.	Ik ha der no ien oan.
It worked very well.	It wurke hiel goed.
I did not get it right	Ik krige it net goed
I knew my father.	Ik koe myn heit.
Much like her, she thought.	In protte as har, tocht se.
As if we did not know that.	As wisten wy dat net.
But this time he did something different.	Mar dizze kear die er wat oars.
He got us the best of the best.	Hy krige ús it bêste fan it bêste.
She kept giving and giving and giving.	Se bleau jaan en jaan en jaan.
But you would have thought they had said something.	Mar jo soene tocht hawwe dat se wat sein hawwe.
I have no family here, and few friends	Ik haw gjin famylje hjir, en pear freonen
Money is one reason.	Jild is ien reden.
I only got those words to pass on to you	Ik krige allinnich dy wurden om oan dy troch te jaan
Let me know if you like them.	Lit my witte as jo se leuk fine.
I had to do this myself	Ik moast dit sels dwaan
And your money.	En dyn jild.
As a mother.	As in mem.
That you do not have to worry about them.	Dat jo hoege jo gjin soargen te meitsjen oer har.
I just do not feel these days anymore	Ik fiel my dizze dagen gewoan net mear
I wanted to talk to her	Ik woe mei har prate
I think we'll be ready this time next year	Ik tink dat wy takom jier dizze kear klear binne
When that happens, it becomes two against one.	As dat bart, wurdt it twa tsjin ien.
I always wanted to know	Ik woe it altyd witte
But that was not the only reason.	Mar dat wie net de ienige reden.
I haven't actually asked her yet, though	Ik ha har eins noch net frege, mar
To tell the truth, he was too.	Om de wierheid te sizzen, wie hy ek.
Now back to me.	No werom nei my.
I knew she was too good to be true	Ik wist dat se te goed wie om wier te wêzen
I'm sure you should get to bed early.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo betiid op bêd moatte.
It's served.	Dit is dien.
It's too long.	It is te lang.
So did they for me.	Dat diene se ek foar my.
It felt like being at home.	It fielde as thús te wêzen.
I looked at him.	Ik seach nei him.
Even a little angry.	Sels in bytsje lilk.
I was back.	Ik wie werom.
I just need some time	Ik haw gewoan wat tiid nedich
Even now, of course, there was something rather than nothing.	Ek no wie der fansels earder wat as neat.
I go to sleep	Ik gean op bêd
I love how things are now.	Ik hâld fan hoe't dingen no binne.
It was not the question of whether it would happen.	It wie net de fraach oft it barre soe.
I will never be them	Ik sil se nea wêze
That's often.	Dat die se faak.
I found her a few months ago	Ik fûn har in pear moanne lyn
You have to be tough.	Jo moatte hurd wêze.
Many things are becoming clear now	In protte dingen wurde no dúdlik
I was just home from school	Ik wie krekt thús fan skoalle
I gave you enough time	Ik joech dy genôch tiid
That was not me.	Dat wie ik net.
I believe you still know enough now	Ik leau dat jo no noch genôch witte
I've never seen him again.	Ik haw him nea wer sjoen.
I know things are not right in your life	Ik wit dat dingen net goed binne yn jo libben
Weather was a problem.	Wetter wie in probleem.
I saw well how he did this	Ik seach goed hoe't er dit die
Take food on time.	Nim iten op 'e tiid.
I had a hard time getting a picture of her	Ik hie it dreech om in foto fan har te krijen
I can not do without them.	Ik kin net sûnder har.
Really nothing else.	Echt neat oars.
Of course not the police.	Fansels net de plysje.
I asked him what he was thinking about	Ik frege him wêr't er oer tocht
I asked if you could do something about it	Ik frege oft jo der wat oan dwaan kinne
He says nothing.	Hy seit neat.
I have school tomorrow	Ik ha moarn skoalle
She's just nice about it.	Se is der gewoan aardich oer.
But why this happened.	Mar wêrom dit is bard.
He would not tell me what was happening.	Hy soe my net fertelle wat der bart.
You really should not talk to him like that.	Jo moatte eins net sa mei him prate.
We have done this time and time again. 	Dat hawwe wy kear op kear op kear dien. 
I'm giving up.	Ik jou op.
I was determined to find out what it is	Ik wie besletten om út te finen wat it is
If it is not, well.	As it net is, goed.
He told me about it though.	Hy fertelde my dêr wol oer.
But for many people, he was beautiful.	Mar foar in protte minsken wie hy moai.
That has worked for me.	Dat hat foar my wurke.
I knew what to say.	Ik wist wat te sizzen.
I want you here, with me, so	Ik wol dy hjir, by my, sa
He looked at her for a very long time.	Hy seach hiel lang nei har.
I've been here before	Ik haw hjir earder west
I do not know why not.	Ik wit net wêrom net.
I was no different.	Ik wie net oars.
Only one.	Mar ien.
I drove a lot on it.	Ik ha der in protte op riden.
I also had to get ready	Ik moast ek klear meitsje
We would do it differently.	Wy soene it oars dwaan.
I was on something	Ik wie op wat
She was happy about that.	Dêr wie se bliid fan.
I would have done anything, he said.	Ik soe alles dien hawwe, sei er.
But that would be difficult.	Mar dat soe dreech wêze.
For them to be ready.	Foar har om klear te wêzen.
I really have to go now	Ik moat no echt gean
I'm not sure where the week went.	Ik bin der net wis fan wêr't de wike gie.
No one has made me feel that way before.	Nimmen hat my earder sa fiel makke.
This thing you have to do.	Dit ding moatte jo dwaan.
It must have hurt what she did.	It moat sear dien hawwe, wat se die.
I want to get away with you	Ik wol mei dy fuort
People want to keep their jobs.	Minsken wolle har wurk hâlde.
He said he would.	Hy sei dat hy soe.
I could love her so much more than her husband	Ik koe fan har safolle mear hâlde as har man
is.	is.
It doesn 't matter where you put me.	It makket neat út wêr't jo my sette.
I think it would be a first	Ik tink dat it in earste wêze soe
She's doing much better.	It giet har folle better.
A city was like that.	In stêd wie sa.
I still had one in hand	Ik hie noch ien yn 'e hân
This was problem.	Dit wie probleem.
I never wanted to do that.	Dat woe ik noait dwaan.
That would not be necessary.	Dat soe net nedich wêze.
I wish he would stay	Ik winskje hy soe bliuwe
You know where we need to go.	Jo witte wêr't wy hinne moatte.
I think he did.	Ik tink dat hy dat dien hat.
Come into the office.	Kom op it kantoar yn.
I need to have you in me	Ik moat dy yn my hawwe
As long as you want.	Lang as jo wolle.
The people have to pay for it.	De minsken moatte it betelje.
Can't say enough good about it.	Kin net sizze genôch goed oer it.
I knew him, of course.	Ik koe him fansels.
Well, still.	No, noch altyd.
He had no worries.	Hy hie gjin soargen.
She looked around the house.	Se seach om it hûs hinne.
I had my dad and my friends	Ik hie myn heit en myn freonen
Looks even better in person.	Sjocht noch better yn persoan.
Ready to enter the water !.	Klear om it wetter yn te gean!.
I could not say how many it was	Ik koe net sizze hoefolle it wiene
This is my name over the door.	Dit is myn namme oer de doar.
I would help him.	Ik soe him helpe.
I'll never hurt you	Ik sil dy noait sear dwaan
I would not worry too much	Ik soe my net al te folle soargen meitsje
I think this is actually us	Ik tink dat dizze is eins ús
I do not feel.	Ik fiel my net.
I should have stayed there.	Ik hie der by bliuwe moatten.
You also have one.	Jo hawwe ek ien.
He had done nothing wrong.	Hy hie neat ferkeard dien.
I think it started there.	Ik tink dat it dêr begûn.
I feel like it was made for me	Ik fiel dat it foar my makke is
But there was not a single picture of me, and it hurt.	Mar d'r wie net ien foto fan my, en dit die sear.
I'm sorry it happened.	It spyt my dat it bard is.
School is good.	Skoalle is goed.
And they are still a problem.	En se binne noch altyd in probleem.
And so he said nothing.	En sa sei er neat.
I can not believe what's going on	Ik kin it net leauwe wat der bart
They've had it for too long.	Se hawwe it al te lang hân.
I love the people here	Ik hâld fan de minsken hjir
I think you need some food.	Ik tink dat jo nedich wat iten.
I can see you sooner.	Ik kin dy earder sjen.
So you never have to be afraid.	Sa hoege jo noait bang te wêzen.
I had never seen that before	Dat hie ik noch noait earder sjoen
I love her a lot	Ik hâld in protte foar har
But really, she's not good.	Mar echt is se net goed.
All the best.	It bêste.
I did not give him away	Ik joech him net wei
The couple has three children.	It pear hat trije bern.
I hope we did.	Ik hoopje dat wy it dien hawwe.
I'm too scared.	Ik bin te bang.
I just need to see her	Ik moat har gewoan sjen
I'm afraid it's not much	Ik bin bang dat it net folle is
Let us help you do the same !.	Lit ús helpe jo dwaan itselde!.
How people get where they come from.	Hoe't minsken komme wêr't se komme.
I can not wait until tonight	Ik kin net wachtsje oant fannacht
It made him angry.	It makke him lilk.
No one was talking.	Nimmen wie oan it praten.
I will be happy to see it.	Ik sil bliid wêze om it te sjen.
On the way home.	Op 'e wei nei hûs.
I know what makes you happy	Ik wit wat jo bliid makket
There is just so much of.	Der is krekt safolle fan.
It was not good at school.	It wie net goed op skoalle.
I had to keep it that way	Ik moast it sa hâlde
But this man told us we could not go away.	Mar dizze man fertelde ús dat wy net fuort koene.
I thought she was right	Ik tocht dat se krekt wie
He said the following.	Hy sei it folgjende.
I've never seen that guy again.	Ik haw dy keardel noait wer sjoen.
I would not worry about him	Ik soe gjin soargen oer him
But she did touch me.	Mar se rekke my wol oan.
I did not like	Ik mocht net
I wonder what he wants this time.	Ik freegje my ôf wat er dizze kear wol.
Two young friends were very ill.	Twa jonge freonen wiene tige siik.
I did not know that was happening	Ik wist net dat dat barde
I'll continue with that today	Ik gean der hjoed troch mei
Never enough hours in the day.	Nea genôch oeren yn 'e dei.
I thought this could not help, of course.	Ik tocht, dit koe net helpe, fansels.
But the police will not do that forever.	Mar de plysje sil dat net foar altyd dwaan.
Can get out of here.	Kin hjir fuort.
He had almost no food left.	Hy hie hast gjin iten mear.
I asked her if she had been a boy or a girl.	Ik frege har oft se in jonge of in famke west hie.
But we are not there yet.	Mar wy binne der noch net.
I can not think of it now	Ik kin der no net oan tinke
I just had to be on hand to help	Ik moast gewoan by de hân wêze om te helpen
She's had a good time.	Se hat har in goede tiid.
The truth was, no one did.	De wierheid wie, gjinien die.
Nobody makes you do anything.	Nimmen makket dy wat te dwaan.
I would have just waited	Ik soe gewoan wachte hawwe
He never opened it.	Hy die it noait iepen.
I just had a question	Ik hie krekt in fraach
However, it was just what we needed.	Hoe dan ek, it wie krekt wat wy nedich wiene.
A woman was killed in her home	Yn har hûs wie in frou om it libben kaam
It does not matter what people do with him.	It makket neat út wat minsken mei him dogge.
Both are different.	Beide binne oars.
But you get the idea.	Mar jo krije it idee.
But this is not a good thing in itself.	Mar dit is gjin goed op himsels.
I would love to see you this morning, if I can	Ik soe dy moarn graach sjen wolle, as it kin
What would happen would happen.	Wat der barre soe, soe barre.
I did not know what was going on.	Ik wist net wat der oan de hân wie.
I was expecting more from you	Ik hie mear fan dy ferwachte
And it's not even a reason.	En it is net iens in reden.
Or almost none.	Of hast gjinien.
I did not ask what was in it	Ik frege net wat der yn siet
It would just hurt.	It soe gewoan sear dwaan.
A lot was my thoughts	In protte wie myn gedachten
I knew this.	Ik wist dizze.
Well, there is a lot.	No, der is in protte.
I wanted you to love me	Ik woe dat jo fan my hâlde
I knew that right away	Dat wist ik fuort
I think of you very often	Ik tocht hiel faak oan dy
I wanted to know what's going on	Ik woe witte wat der bart
I knew what needed to be done.	Ik wist wat der dien wurde moast.
Which of course she is not.	Wat se fansels net is.
I always wondered what happened to you	Ik frege my altyd ôf wat der mei dy bard is
He would be home.	Hy soe thús wêze.
I was only told this morning	Ik waard allinnich ferteld fan 'e moarn
Maybe he wasn't even sure.	Miskien wie er der net iens wis fan.
I have done this once.	Ik haw dit ien kear dien.
It came to me.	It kaam by my.
Then you move on to other things.	Dan geane jo troch nei oare dingen.
I thought you would go to her	Ik tocht dat jo nei har gean soene
What is not, is not.	Wat net is, is it net.
Tell you more.	Fertel dy noch mear.
I did not want him to ever stop	Ik woe net dat er oait ophâlde soe
I do not know about that.	Dêr wit ik net fan.
I'm still his mother	Ik bin noch altyd syn mem
I think it went better than we expected.	Ik tink dat it better gie as wy ferwachte.
I need to talk to him	Ik moat mei him prate
We need to find the words.	Wy moatte de wurden fine.
I want him to love me	Ik wol dat er fan my hâldt
I can not help her.	Ik kin har net helpe.
I doubt he will ever return	Ik twifelje oan dat er oait werom komt
He admitted regret.	Hy joech spyt ta.
I thought about so much	Ik tocht oer safolle
It was not the same as in a friend's house.	It wie net itselde as yn it hûs fan in freon.
He did not have to read it again.	Hy hoegde it net wer te lêzen.
It will not help.	It sil net helpe.
Not against that thing.	Net tsjin dat ding.
I started out the door	Ik begûn de doar út
I knew the man.	Ik koe de man.
It was a girl.	It wie in famke.
I want to take another chance	Ik wol noch in kâns nimme
I needed them.	Ik hie se nedich.
I will not be so nice next time	Ik sil de folgjende kear net sa aardich wêze
Where he would go was another question.	Wêr't er wei soe, wie in oare fraach.
There was nothing for me to do.	Der wie neat foar my te dwaan.
I should have helped you earlier	Ik hie dy earder helpe moatten
It needs to do something.	It moat wat dwaan.
I had not seen it that way	Ik hie it net sa sjoen
It can be done, and can be done very well.	It kin dien wurde, en kin dien wurde hiel goed.
I almost ran over him	Ik rûn hast oer him hinne
It must be real.	It moat echt wêze.
See the people.	Sjoch de minsken.
They did not need that much time.	Safolle tiid hiene se net nedich.
I did not expect you so early	Ik hie dy net sa betiid ferwachte
I did not get sick of everything we did	Ik waard net siik fan alles wat wy diene
We're still trying to figure that out.	Wy besykje dat noch út te finen.
I thought a lot about her today	Ik tocht hjoed in protte oan har
I think that's where my problem was	Ik tink dat is wêr't myn probleem wie
If you do.	As jo ​​dogge.
We were no longer alone.	Wy wiene net mear allinnich.
He will think she does not want to talk to him.	Hy sil tinke dat se net mei him prate wol.
He is now one of us.	Hy is no ien fan ús.
Everyone participates.	Elkenien docht mei.
I would be nice to him.	Ik soe aardich tsjin him wêze.
It's actually very nice.	It is eins hiel moai.
I waited for what would happen, but did nothing	Ik wachte op wat soe barre, mar neat die
I realized this would not work	Ik realisearre dat dit net gean soe
I might have gotten a little angry	Ik hie miskien wat lilk wurden
Your friend is nice to you again.	Dyn freon is wer aardich foar dy.
Not like it is now.	Net sa as it no is.
I opened it and handed it to him	Ik die iepen en joech it oan him
They love me.	Se hâlde fan my.
My kids and I will need some time to get there.	Ik en myn bern sille wat tiid nedich hawwe om dêr te kommen.
I want nothing else	Ik wol neat oars
Would not do it.	Soe it net dwaan.
I almost did not have it	Ik hie it hast net
I'm not taking food with you.	Ik nim gjin iten mei dy.
No one knows where it could have been.	Nimmen wit wêr't it koe west hawwe.
I had to find a way in	Ik moast in wei yn fine
I did not have to say too much	Ik hoegde net te folle te sizzen
And everyone knows it.	En elkenien wit it.
I could not come to you	Ik koe net by dy komme
I can not even believe this.	Ik kin dit net iens leauwe.
And there are things we can do.	En d'r binne dingen dy't wy kinne dwaan.
A few other people were making out or	In pear oare minsken wiene meitsjen út of
What actually happened was again something else.	Wat der eins barde wie wer wat oars.
Neither went well.	Gjin fan beide gie goed.
It will get better with time.	It sil mei de tiid better wurde.
Everything bart.	Alles bart.
For some reason he did not want to leave it.	Om ien of oare reden woe er it net litte.
And then again.	En dan wer.
We know this now.	Dit witte wy no.
If only this were true.	As dit mar wier wie.
You were very, very happy with it.	Jo wiene der tige, tige bliid mei.
I even made a friend	Ik makke sels in freon
These are not bad kids.	Dit binne gjin minne bern.
It will get better.	It sil better wurde.
I know they're in your mind	Ik wit dat se yn jo gedachten binne
This is my house.	Dit is myn hûs.
Life was beautiful.	It libben wie moai.
I want to be like that	Ik wol sa wêze
She can do it wrong.	Se kin it ferkeard dwaan.
You just have to work hard.	Jo moatte gewoan hurd wurkje.
I could not afford to be seen	Ik koe it net betelje om sjoen te wurden
When things happen, you move on.	As dingen barre, geane jo troch.
He was angry.	Hy wie lilk.
I can not handle all this myself	Ik kin dit net allegear sels oan
And that must be it.	En dat moat it wêze.
I know everything, mind you.	Ik wit alles, tink.
If he's still here.	As er hjir noch is.
I want him alive if I can	Ik wol him yn libben as it kin
I think you do not.	Ik tink dat jo net dogge.
That's what he told me.	Dat hat er my ferteld.
That's a lot of life.	Dat is in protte libben.
I wondered how he knew her	Ik frege my ôf hoe't er har koe
If only they would see.	As se mar sjen soene.
I'll find it as it is	Ik sil it fine as it is
Let's just take it.	Lit it mar nimme.
She worked in his office for a year.	Se wurke in jier yn syn kantoar.
Until this morning.	Oant dizze moarn.
I had no idea how late it was	Ik hie gjin idee hoe let it wie
I would love to help you with that	Ik soe graach helpe dy mei
Do not feel that you have to do everything yourself.	Fiel jo net dat jo alles sels dwaan moatte.
I should have been a good wife, but for you	Ik hie in goede frou wêze moatten, mar foar dy
I liked the father.	Ik mocht de heit wol.
If it does not, there is a problem.	As it net docht, is d'r in probleem.
I have decided.	Ik haw my besletten.
I asked if it was sick	Ik frege oft it siik wie
I could see why he liked it so much	Ik koe sjen wêrom hy it sa leuk fûn
I did not know you do not want me	Ik wist net dat jo my net wolle
It's a good life.	It is in goed libben.
And money too.	En jild ek.
I really did not want to see anyone or talk to anyone	Ik woe eins net ien sjen of mei immen prate
That was all before he left.	Dat alles wie foardat hy gie.
I became angry at my wife and her family.	Ik waard lilk op myn frou en har famylje.
I did not even look back	Ik seach net iens werom
I need to see him.	Ik moat him sjen.
I thought no one would be there	Ik tocht dat der gjinien by wêze soe
That's exactly how faith works.	Dat is krekt hoe't leauwe wurket.
I did not like it	Ik hie it net leuk
I never found what it was	Ik haw noait fûn wat it wie
You are so beautiful.	Do bist sa moai.
There used to be.	Der wie eartiids.
I would be happy if that was the case	Ik soe bliid wêze as dat sa wie
It was her song.	It wie har liet.
I can tell it by looking at you	Ik kin it fertelle troch nei dy te sjen
Please try it yourself and let us know what you think.	Besykje it asjebleaft sels en lit ús witte wat jo tinke.
He had no idea where he might be needed.	Hy hie gjin idee wêr't hy nedich wêze koe.
It can not be.	It kin net wêze.
So you can think of those two things happening together.	Sa kinne jo tinke oan dy twa dingen barre tegearre.
I wanted to tell you	Ik woe it dy fertelle
They can not stand it.	Se kinne it net oan.
I think you like it	Ik tink dat jo it leuk fine
Do something about it.	Doch der wat oan.
But think about the things they do.	Mar tink oer de dingen dy't se dogge.
I went over.	Ik gie oer.
I took it and made my way here	Ik naam it en makke myn wei hjir
Did any of us think it would be so.	Hat ien fan ús tocht dat it sa wêze soe.
I'm glad it's you.	Ik bin bliid dat it jo bist.
I could live at this place	Ik koe wenne oan dit plak
They were the same.	Se wiene itselde.
I could think of nothing else	Ik koe neat oars tinke
And what do you think ?.	En wat tinksto?.
I was really happy to come home	Ik wie echt bliid thús te kommen
I knew he was so much more than that	Ik wist dat hy safolle mear wie dan dat
I've been doing enough of that lately	Dêr haw ik de lêste tiid genôch oan dien
I had to believe in him	Ik moast yn him leauwe
I can not wait to have it again	Ik kin net wachtsje om it wer te hawwen
He told her she was the 'one'.	Hy fertelde har dat se de 'ien' wie.
I can see all my parents	Ik kin al myn âlden sjen
I wonder what's going on	Ik freegje my ôf wat der bart
But that does not stop there.	Mar dêr hâldt it net op.
I could make this work.	Ik koe dit wurk meitsje.
I've never really looked at it that way	Ik ha der eins noait sa nei sjoen
Reason, he did that earlier.	Reden, hy die dat earder.
I did not know she was found	Ik wist net dat se fûn wie
We decided to take it back.	Wy besletten it werom te nimmen.
One name, and another name	Ien namme, en in oare namme
I told her we had been together for a week	Ik fertelde har dat wy in wike tegearre west hiene
You are the best.	Do bist de bêste.
I will not be able to see enough of them	Ik sil net genôch fan har sjen kinne
Long ago, she might have had hope.	Lang lyn hie se miskien wol hope.
What works for them may not work for me.	Wat foar har wurket, wurket miskien net foar my.
I would love to be there if you do.	Ik soe der graach wêze wolle, as jo dat dogge.
I just did not know what that reason was	Ik wist gewoan net wat dy reden wie
I walked to his house	Ik rûn nei syn hûs ta
You can take it or leave it.	Jo kinne it nimme of litte.
He came through the next week and just came through.	Hy kaam de oare wike troch en kaam gewoan troch.
We hope you enjoy it !.	Wy hoopje dat jo it leuk fine!.
I wanted to know what he knew.	Ik woe witte wat er wist.
A few there.	In pear dêr.
Not so.	Net sa is it.
Do what you have to.	Doch wat jo moatte.
But there are other things she can do.	Mar d'r binne oare dingen dy't se dwaan kin.
And we have nothing.	En wy hawwe neat.
Give her what she wanted.	Jou har wat se woe.
I was not sure what to make of it	Ik wie der net wis fan wat ik der fan meitsje moast
I wish she was here now	Ik woe dat se hjir no wie
Will not be back.	Sil net werom.
Do not scare him.	Meitsje him net bang.
He's a good guy to be around.	Hy is in goede keardel om by te wêzen.
We did not need them.	Wy hiene se net nedich.
I knew what they were	Ik wist wat se wiene
It has nothing to do with us.	It is neat mei ús te dwaan.
That was the last time.	Dat wie de lêste kear.
If you do not, well.	As jo ​​dat net dogge, goed.
I'm not quite happy	Ik bin net hielendal bliid
They come from us.	Se komme fan ús.
I knew she would be there	Ik wist dat se der wêze soe
I did not know anyone who could help me	Ik wist net ien dy't my helpe koe
I could no longer afford to be that person	Ik koe it my net mear betelje om dy persoan te wêzen
I could not do much more	Ik koe net folle mear
She never looked better.	Se seach der noait better út.
She will not work.	Se sil net wurkje.
I wish there was another way.	Ik winskje dat der in oare manier wie.
I did that very early.	Ik die dat hiel betiid.
It was very early.	It wie hiel betiid.
Let us not think of them anymore.	Lit ús net mear oan har tinke.
I did really wrong by you	Ik die echt ferkeard troch dy
I wonder what dad does	Ik freegje my ôf wat heit docht
And none of it comes back.	En neat fan it komt werom.
All questions are the same.	Alle fragen binne itselde.
I could never think of that.	Dat koe ik noait tinke.
It's not the same as being a mom.	It is net itselde as mem wêze.
I'm still here.	Ik bin hjir noch.
Come back in an hour.	Kom oer in oere werom.
Then you have no chance.	Dan hawwe jo gjin kâns.
I would tell her	Ik soe it har fertelle
I just wanted to see how it went	Ik woe gewoan sjen hoe't it gie
I had never seen her like this before	Ik hie har noch nea sa sjoen
I tried to see her	Ik besocht har te sjen
I want you to stay with me	Ik wol dat jo by my bliuwe
I think otherwise.	Ik tink oars.
We can get him out of there better.	Wy kinne him der better út krije.
I think it's not where it should be.	Ik tink dat it net is wêr't it wêze moat.
Glad you're both good.	Bliid dat jo beide goed binne.
That's just like you.	Dat is krekt as dy.
I saw it as clearly as the day	Ik seach it sa dúdlik as de dei
That's right here.	Dat stiet hjir.
I love having more than one	Ik hâld fan mear as ien te hawwen
You have worked so hard for this opportunity.	Jo hawwe sa hurd wurke foar dizze kâns.
I could get really sick from it.	Ik koe der hielendal siik fan wurde.
Well, but one really.	No, mar ien echt.
Such a nice thing.	Sa'n leuk ding.
I never met his parents	Ik nea moete syn âlden
These can be good or bad.	Dizze kinne goed of min wêze.
I could not	Dat koe ik net
And it's not easy.	En it is net maklik.
Two things at work there.	Twa dingen oan it wurk dêr.
I did not feel that way until today	Ik fielde my net sa oant hjoed
I know you know what's going on	Ik wit dat jo witte wat der bart
I want to be your wife	Ik wol dyn frou wêze
Think about what you want, not what you do not want.	Tink oer wat jo wolle, net wat jo net wolle.
You do not get away with it.	Jo komme hjir net mei fuort.
I want to know who he sees	Ik wol witte wa't er sjocht
We talk about it with a lot of other people.	Wy prate der oer mei in protte oare minsken.
He did not know he was angry.	Hy wist net dat er lilk wie.
As he walked to his father.	As hy rûn nei syn heit.
I just could not wait to see you	Ik koe gewoan net wachtsje om dy te sjen
I should have gone back to the lake	Ik hie werom moatten nei de mar
He was angry.	Hy wie lilk.
You did nothing.	Do hast neat dien.
I did not worry that she would find them again	Ik makke my gjin soargen dat se se wer fûn
You can also ask your friends and family.	Jo kinne ek freegje jo freonen en famylje.
Along with the following.	Tegearre mei de folgjende.
I wish he was not there	Ik woe dat er der net wie
I just did not need it	Ik hie it gewoan net nedich
Please do not leave me alone.	Lit my asjebleaft net litte.
I did not think he would come so soon	Ik hie net tocht dat er sa gau komme soe
It was good to be home.	It wie goed om thús te wêzen.
They are away from me now.	Se binne no fan my ôf.
No one knows her name.	Gjinien wit har namme.
Maybe she should just buy time.	Miskien moast se mar tiid keapje.
I hope you can make it all happen	Ik hoopje dat jo it allegear kinne meitsje
And everything seemed to be getting pretty good.	En alles like aardich goed te wurden.
I did not ask for your name	Ik haw jo namme net frege
As father must.	As heit moat.
We continue.	Wy geane troch.
Or almost as good.	Of hast like goed.
I wondered if it was from her.	Ik frege my ôf oft it fan har wie.
Maybe it would work this evening.	Miskien soe it dizze jûn wurkje.
I just met him today	Ik moete krekt mei him hjoed
This is coming through me.	Dit komt troch my.
Whether they like it or not.	Oft se it leuk fine of net.
I looked at him better	Ik seach him better oan
Maybe you can get something different from them.	Miskien kinne jo wat oars fan har krije.
I still think that's true.	Ik tink noch altyd dat dat wier is.
No woman should stop this.	Gjin frou moat dit ophâlde.
I'm not angry at her.	Ik bin net lilk op har.
I think it wants to go away.	Ik tink dat it fuort wol.
I made good time for school	Ik makke goede tiid foar skoalle
What had he thought.	Wat hie er tocht.
But it keeps you alive.	Mar it hâldt dy yn libben.
More than anything else he just wanted to see her again.	Mear as wat oars woe er har mar wer sjen.
Well, he did just that.	No, hy die krekt dat.
Not that we're good, mind you.	Net dat wy goed binne, tink.
There can never be.	Der kin nea wêze.
We are currently working on it for a few weeks.	Der wurdt no in pear wike oan wurke.
They are there to make money.	Se binne der om jild te meitsjen.
I wanted to look at it	Ik woe der nei sjen
I love children.	Ik hâld fan bern.
I wanted it so badly that it hurt	Ik woe dat sa graach dat it sear die
I have to go with this	Ik moat gean mei dit
His friends were not either.	Syn freonen wiene ek net.
And last night he had seen me.	En fannacht hie er my sjoen.
Wait one.	Wachtsje ien.
Earlier this month.	Earder dizze moanne.
I hope you will wait for me	Ik hoopje dat jo op my wachtsje sille
That did not go too well.	Dat gie net al te goed.
In man.	In man.
I've been waiting for someone like you	Ik haw wachte op ien as dy
He has had it so hard.	Hy hat it sa dreech hân.
They were here.	Se wiene hier.
She was very.	Se wie tige.
I had not asked for it.	Ik hie der net om frege.
I'm telling the truth	Ik fertel de wierheid
Here's the reason.	Hjir is de reden.
No one was around them.	Gjinien wie om har hinne.
It will be easy enough.	It sil maklik genôch wêze.
I see no way around it.	Ik sjoch der gjin manier om hinne.
I was always like that, even as a kid	Ik wie altyd sa, sels as bern
I love you.	Ik bin yn jo hâlden.
That's ready to go.	Dat is klear om te gean.
It's here and now.	It is hjir en no.
But it does not happen.	Mar it bart net.
It was never easy to find.	It wie nea maklik te finen.
I'll know if you do it wrong.	Ik sil witte as jo dogge it ferkeard.
And then to that man.	En dan nei dy man.
Let's hope.	Litte wy hoopje.
But two problems.	Mar twa problemen.
I think they will, just to be different	Ik tink dat se dat sille, gewoan om oars te wêzen
He has no plans.	Hy is net fan plan.
I was single until a few years ago	Ik wie ien oant in pear jier lyn
Will try it.	Sil besykje it.
I did not quite figure it out	Ik tocht it net hielendal út
She was not the first.	Se wie net de earste.
So are my parents.	Dat binne myn âlden ek.
Can you please tell me how I should do that.	Kinne jo my asjebleaft fertelle hoe't ik dat dwaan moat.
Then you need to see what you have.	Dan moatte jo sjen wat jo hawwe.
The two things that come to mind.	De twa dingen dy't komme ta.
Which may have been true.	Wat miskien wier west hawwe.
The last time is all about him.	De lêste tiid is alles oer him.
So she went.	Sa gie se.
I have enough family	Ik haw genôch famylje
Wa, wa, wa.	Wa, wa, wa.
I did this to him	Ik haw dit oan him dien
Come in and wait.	Kom yn en wachtsje.
This is better.	Dizze is better.
It's nice.	It is aardich.
Everything is still in the same place.	Alles is noch op itselde plak.
A meeting took place	In gearkomste fûn plak
I knew exactly what was going to happen	Ik wist krekt wat der barre soe
It's not easy.	It is net maklik.
I was dealing with people who knew better	Ik hie te meitsjen mei minsken dy't better wisten
I really wish he was here now	Ik winskje echt dat hy hjir no wie
All by me.	Alles troch my.
I can not wait to get it	Ik kin net wachtsje om it te krijen
It was never a problem.	It wie nea in probleem.
I could give you work	Ik koe jo wurk jaan
We do not think so.	Dat tinke wy net.
That I could not let them	Dat koe ik se net litte
But first you have to do something for me.	Mar earst moatte jo wat foar my dwaan.
I look away from her	Ik sjoch fan har ôf
She does the same thing.	Se docht itselde ding.
It was also the truth.	It wie ek de wierheid.
Without the animal you would never get there.	Sûnder it bist der nea kommen.
A very good question here	In hiel goede fraach hjir
Then to me.	Dan nei my.
And when that day comes.	En as dy dei komt.
I did not even want to think of him	Ik woe net iens oan him tinke
I think he probably will, actually.	Ik tink dat hy wierskynlik sil, eins.
You do not know this.	Jo witte dit net.
It's too painful.	It is te sear.
That's nice of you.	Dat is aardich fan dy.
But she could not.	Mar dat koe se net.
It's going well so far.	It giet goed oant no ta.
I just want, need, things to go well	Ik wol gewoan, nedich, dingen om goed te gean
I told him he had to help me.	Ik sei tsjin him dat hy my helpe moast.
I've been busy already	Ik haw it al drok hân
You know it well.	Jo witte it goed.
I want you to take me home	Ik wol dat jo my mei nei hûs nimme
I was just talking to her	Ik wie krekt mei har te praten
I take my whole family there!	Ik nim myn hiele famylje dêr!
She had done it herself.	Se hie it sels dien.
I did not want to, but she needed me	Ik woe net, mar se hie my nedich
He never had.	Hy hie noait.
But that's a problem.	Mar dat is in probleem.
Days and days.	Dagen en dagen.
I still wish she was my wife	Ik woe noch altyd dat se myn frou wie
He looks absolutely perfect.	Hy sjocht der hielendal út.
Then those two get nothing.	Dan krije dy twa neat.
I told you so.	Ik haw it dy sein.
So sorry.	It spyt my sa.
Why did we wait so long?	Wêrom hawwe wy sa lang wachtsje?
I will always, no matter what happens	Ik sil altyd, wat der ek bart
We do not like it.	Wy hâlde it net.
There's so much we do not know.	D'r is safolle dat wy net witte.
Do not let them know how scared you are.	Lit har net witte hoe bang jo binne.
He asked me to get a job.	Hy frege my om in baan te krijen.
I should do the same, he thought	Ik soe itselde dwaan moatte, tocht er
I was completely free	Ik wie hielendal frij
I did not want to do this thing to you	Ik woe dit ding net oan dy dwaan
The mother of the child.	De mem fan it bern.
It was really good.	It wie echt goed.
There will never be again.	Der sil nea wer wêze.
We have all worked hard to find you.	Wy hawwe allegear hurd wurke om jo te finen.
Who does that.	Wa docht dat.
I know what needs to be done	Ik wit wat der dien wurde moat
It's what you're for.	It is wêr't jo foar binne.
I do not think that is what is happening.	Ik tink net dat dat is wat der bart.
No one wanted to.	Net ien woe.
I'm leaving the room, now	Ik gean de keamer út, no
One more left.	Noch ien oer.
You have to tell me what's coming.	Jo moatte my fertelle wat der komt.
It's one on one.	It is ien op ien.
To tell me.	Om it my te fertellen.
A 'has been found.	In' is fûn.
We just can not.	Wy kinne gewoan net.
I love this place.	Ik hâld fan dit plak.
I'm waiting to see if there's more to come	Ik wachtsje ôf oft der wat mear fan komt
I know what's going on here.	Ik wit wat hjir bart.
I wanted to be everything to her	Ik woe alles foar har wêze
I just walked.	Ik rûn gewoan.
He went under two years.	Hy gie ûnder twa jier.
I really wish it was	Ik woe echt dat it wie
This he wanted.	Dit woe er.
I think we have a chance to do something good	Ik tink dat wy in kâns hawwe om wat goed te dwaan
I think you can help me figure it out.	Ik tink dat jo my helpe kinne om it út te finen.
I should go back.	Ik soe werom moatte.
You need to do that to help us.	Jo moatte dat dwaan om ús te helpen.
I can not completely agree with that	Dêr kin ik it net hielendal mei iens wêze
I really could not stop eating	Ik koe echt net ophâlde mei iten
In fact, it would work well with it.	Eins soe it der goed mei wurkje.
I just have to get away	Ik moat gewoan fuort
He did not know this man.	Hy koe dizze man net.
Everyone will know.	Elkenien sil witte.
I was scared to go there	Ik wie bang om dêr hinne te gean
I need to take care of my friends	Ik moat nei myn freonen soargje
But he did not have it.	Mar hy hie it net.
I'm coming soon.	Ik kom gau.
You just have to let them go.	Jo moatte har gewoan litte.
We do not do that.	Dat dogge wy net.
She totally does.	Dat docht se hielendal.
That's him.	Dat is hy.
I have heard nothing from him.	Ik ha neat fan him heard.
I have one just like him	Ik haw ien krekt as hy
I really did not want to be alone	Ik woe eins net allinnich wêze
It's what he wants to do.	It is wat er dwaan wol.
I have your favorite food.	Ik haw dy dyn favorite iten.
A woman knows everything about her children	In frou wit alles oer har bern
For some reason it does not work.	Om ien of oare reden wurket it net.
I know of him.	Ik wit fan him.
They would be ready.	Se soene klear wêze.
No telling what this guy would do to her.	Gjin fertellen wat dizze man har dwaan soe.
Maybe she said something.	Miskien sei se wat.
They are there.	Se binne der.
He knew them by name.	Hy koe se by namme.
We believe they do.	Wy leauwe dat se dogge.
I want a wife, children and a home	Ik wol in frou, bern en in hûs
Let it go let it go.	Lit it gean lit it gean.
Many things can happen in such a time.	In protte dingen kinne barre yn sa'n tiid.
That was a good and bad time.	Dat wie in goede en minne tiid.
A good party, that is	In goed feest, dat wol
But this could.	Mar dizze koe.
He wished he was alone.	Hy woe dat er allinnich wie.
I need some time alone	Ik haw wat tiid allinnich nedich
I got my water and went back to the room	Ik krige myn wetter en gie werom nei de keamer
I do not know what it will be this year.	Ik wit net wat it dit jier wurde sil.
There was something going on.	Der wie wat oan de hân.
I found something.	Ik haw wat fûn.
Maybe I can help you with that	Ik kin dy miskien helpe mei
I live across the place these days.	Ik wenje oer it plak dizze dagen.
I wanted to love my father, by whatever name	Ik woe fan myn heit hâlde, mei hokker namme dan ek
But there are many things to do for the kids.	Mar d'r binne in protte dingen foar de bern te dwaan.
I would be angry too.	Ik soe ek lilk wêze.
I really did not want to be here anymore	Ik woe hjir eins net mear wêze
He wants out.	Hy wol út.
The father looked up.	De heit seach op.
And then he.	En dan hy.
Would have been so easy too.	Soe ek sa maklik west hawwe.
I see no one.	Ik sjoch nimmen.
And if there were, do it.	En as der wiene, doch it.
I have no idea who they are	Ik ha gjin idee wa't se binne
I just can not wait to do this	Ik kin gewoan net wachtsje om dit te dwaan
I have to tell you now.	Ik moat it dy no sizze.
I already told him pretty much everything	Ik fertelde him al sa'n bytsje alles
I should go to school	Ik soe op skoalle moatte
That he did not have in him, he thought.	Dat hie er net yn him, tocht er.
She wondered why he was so different.	Se frege har ôf wêrom't er sa oars wie.
A woman approached the water	In frou kaam it wetter oan
But we'll see.	Mar wy sille sjen.
But he can not.	Mar hy kin net.
This was her last film before she died.	Dit wie har lêste film foardat se stoar.
I know it bothers me	Ik wit dat it my docht
I thought of it first	Ik tocht der earst oan
I knew you were a bad way	Ik wist dat jo in minne manier wiene
He has not been here for a long time.	Hy is hjir al lang net mear west.
It's still here.	It is hjir noch.
People may look at you and say that not everyone can do that.	Minsken kinne nei jo sjen en sizze dat net elkenien dat kin dwaan.
But there's more to it than that.	Mar d'r is mear oan as dat.
Please, do not worry.	Asjebleaft, meitsje jo gjin soargen.
I knew exactly what it was	Ik wist krekt wat it wie
Not a bad idea.	Gjin min idee.
You're doing well.	Dat dogge jo goed.
You're a person just like me.	Do bist in persoan krekt as ik.
He did not want her to be his.	Hy woe net dat se fan him wie.
I look forward to my next book	Ik sjoch út nei myn folgjende boek
He just loves everything about everything.	Hy hâldt gewoan fan alles oer alles.
Will probably be back to get more.	Sil wierskynlik werom wêze om mear te krijen.
I have to go to this school	Ik moat nei dizze skoalle
It looked like one.	It like ien.
I would be nice.	Ik soe aardich wêze.
By the.	Troch de.
I had in mind that we were going tomorrow	Ik hie yn gedachten dat wy moarn geane
I can't believe it	Ik kin it net leauwe
I looked under everything in the room	Ik seach ûnder alles yn 'e keamer
And it started.	En it begûn.
We do not do this to make money.	Wy dogge dit net om jild te meitsjen.
We will not see her again	Wy sille har net wer sjen
I know you want to go back to school	Ik wit dat jo werom wolle nei skoalle
I thought he had come and gone.	Ik tocht dat er kommen en fuort wie.
I'm just a woman with a past	Ik bin gewoan in frou mei in ferline
That's coming.	Dat komt.
Good and true.	Goed en wier.
Let's still hope.	Lit ús noch hoopje.
I will not do that to him	Dat sil ik him net dwaan
I found it in this book	Ik fûn it yn dit boek
Maybe even something more.	Miskien sels noch wat mear.
Back as soon as we can.	Werom sa gau as wy kinne.
I have to do this alone	Ik moat dit allinnich dwaan
They will only be there a month.	Se sille der mar in moanne wêze.
I have not heard anything yet.	Ik ha noch neat heard.
He gave it up.	Hy joech it op.
I will find them myself	Ik sil se sels fine
That was the last thing she wanted.	Dat wie it lêste wat se woe.
I think we were very happy together	Ik tink dat wy wiene hiel bliid tegearre
Let them think what they want.	Lit se tinke wat se wolle.
You're busy.	Do hast it drok.
No one set them up to go.	Nimmen sette har op om te gean.
Maybe not in our lives.	Miskien net yn ús libben.
I could not let you hurt me again	Ik koe dy my net wer sear litte litte
I was just so scared of you	Ik wie krekt sa bang foar dy
I do not see the mine there.	Ik sjoch de myn dêr net.
You do not even want to think that.	Dat wolle jo net iens tinke.
I dare say nothing	Ik doar neat te sizzen
It's what you are.	It is wat jo binne.
There they are.	Dêr binne se.
I wish she would just stop	Ik winskje dat se gewoan ophâlde soe
If that's gone, that's with us forever.	As dat fuort is, dan is dat foar altyd mei ús.
This should not happen.	Dit moat net barre.
I saw what was happening around me	Ik seach wat der om my hinne barde
And on her.	En op har.
Which are good for food.	Hokker binne goed foar iten.
I had not seen or done otherwise	Ik hie net sjoen of oars dien
I have no job.	Ik haw gjin wurk.
I have no idea how this thing works	Ik haw gjin idee hoe't dit ding wurket
It's just something where they hold your hand through everything.	It is gewoan wat wêr't se jo hân troch alles hâlde.
I did not see him go.	Ik seach him net gean.
Go out and make it busy.	Gean út en meitsje it drok.
I'm not sure if this is the right way.	Ik bin der net wis fan oft dit de goede manier is.
This is no longer the best.	Dit is net mear de bêste.
You are the only hope of your parents.	Jo binne de ienige hope fan jo âlden.
That's what he did.	Dat hat er dien.
Tomorrow can never come.	Moarn kin nea komme.
You've seen him now for a year and two days.	Jo hawwe him no in jier en twa dagen sjoen.
I never found it.	Ik haw it noait fûn.
I think we were both scared	Ik tink dat wy beide bang wiene
She was not a little ready for that.	Dêr wie se net in bytsje klear foar.
And now is not the time.	En no is it net de tiid.
I expected this a lot	Ik ferwachte dit folle
You need to tell me one of you.	Jo moatte my ien fan jo fertelle.
He's just late.	Hy is krekt let.
I've never even seen him	Ik haw him sels noait sjoen
I can not have them.	Ik kin se net hawwe.
You'll ask me something.	Jo sille my wat freegje.
Did not have much money.	Hie net folle jild.
His new wife had me.	Syn nije frou hie my.
I was not allowed to say anything	Ik mocht neat sizze
I can not go back home without him	Ik kin net werom nei hûs sûnder him
She was afraid for the lives of her children.	Se wie bang foar it libben fan har bern.
We can not keep up.	Wy kinne der net by bliuwe.
Become when he died.	Wurden as hy stoar.
That he would not do the same to her.	Dat hy soe har net itselde dwaan.
I said he had to buy one	Ik sei dat er ien keapje moast
Now you will look at you.	No sille jo nei dy sjen.
I never knew his name.	Ik wist syn namme noait.
I love you too.	Ik hâld ek fan dy.
It would probably work.	It soe wierskynlik wurkje.
She was so careful to get everyone.	Se wie sa foarsichtich om elkenien te krijen.
We were wrong.	Wy wiene ferkeard.
We both do.	Wy beide dogge.
I'm pretty sure of that.	Dêr bin ik frij wis fan.
They never really say anything.	Se sizze noait echt wat.
I could not help but see them.	Ik koe it net helpe om se te sjen.
Not us.	Net ús.
I knew what you were doing	Ik wist wat jo diene
I can do something for you	Ik kin wat foar dy dwaan
It does not matter, he said.	It makket neat út, sei er.
Afraid of me.	Bang foar my.
', and is'.	', en is'.
Just think of one.	Tink mar oan ien.
I do not feel better	Ik fiel my net better
And it was not what she wanted either.	En it wie ek net wat se woe.
I felt it was too early to tell	Ik fielde dat it te betiid wie om te sizzen
I want to ask her everything	Ik wol har alles freegje
But people can find them.	Mar minsken kinne se fine.
And he did not want that.	En dat woe er net.
All by myself.	Hielendal sels.
I will never see her children	Ik sil har bern noait sjen
I had never seen him like this before	Ik hie him noch noait sa earder sjoen
I probably would not like her angry	Ik soe wierskynlik net graach har lilk
I had never thought of that before	Dêr hie ik noch noait oan tocht
That's what I tell people all the time	Dat fertel ik de minsken de hiele tiid
She is a single mother of two children.	Se is ien mem fan twa bern.
There is giving, and there is taking.	Der is jaan, en der is nimme.
This is too fun.	Dit is te leuk.
And that's all right.	En dat is hielendal goed.
I had not heard it for so long	Ik hie it sa lang net heard
He is as good as his word.	Hy is sa goed as syn wurd.
That should make everyone worried.	Dat soe elkenien soargen meitsje moatte.
The good kids, not the bad ones.	De goede bern, net de minne.
It's really up to you.	It is echt oan jo.
Here is my idea.	Hjir is myn idee.
He was angry now.	Hy wie no lilk.
Someone looked at him.	Immen seach him oan.
No one even knows exactly what happened to her.	Nimmen wit ek krekt wat der mei har bard is.
You do not do very happy.	Jo dogge net hiel bliid.
I'm just going out for the day.	Ik gean gewoan út foar de dei.
That's what the police know.	Dat wit de plysje.
I need to see him.	Ik moat him sjen.
I gave up a little time on that	Ik joech dêr in bytsje tiid op
He has only been in it once, and has never gone back.	Hy hat der mar ien kear yn west, en is nea werom gien.
Too scared to.	Te bang om.
This is on you.	Dit is op dy.
Of course, we know all about it.	Fansels, wy witte alles oer.
I had heard of it before	Ik hie der earder fan heard
I'm doing something wrong, but not sure where.	Ik bin dwaan wat ferkeard, mar net wis wêr.
I liked going there	Ik mocht der graach hinne
I wish you had been here	Ik woe datsto hjir west hie
I hope he's there	Ik hoopje dat hy der is
I would not stop	Ik soe net ophâlde
I feel like it's coming.	Ik fiel dat it komt.
She will be happy.	Se sil bliid wêze.
Take her hand.	Nim har hân.
But there were still three to go.	Mar der wiene noch trije te gean.
And no questions asked.	En gjin fragen.
I did not know you would be here so soon	Ik wist net dat jo hjir sa gau wêze soene
I can tell you those things	Ik kin dy dingen fertelle
I'm glad you like the book.	Ik bin bliid dat jo it boek leuk fine.
Everyone was ready to leave soon.	Elkenien wie ree om gau fuort te gean.
It's about family.	It giet oer famylje.
I did not agree with the man	Ik koe de man net iens
Very good, very.	Hiel goed, heul.
I did not even know what to say	Ik wist net iens wat ik sizze moast
I'm not sure where my father was	Ik bin der net wis fan wêr't myn heit wie
I would be so angry.	Ik soe sa lilk wurde.
A few months ago she would have	In pear moanne lyn soe se hawwe
But there were no more.	Mar der wiene net mear.
I do not see why not.	Ik sjoch net wêrom net.
Here's how it worked.	Hjir is hoe't it wurke.
We could do more.	Wy koene mear dwaan.
In her hair.	Yn har hier.
Try some new things.	Besykje wat nije dingen.
But they did not say much.	Mar se seine net folle.
I hope we both make it	Ik hoopje dat wy beide meitsje it
Maybe he was telling the truth.	Miskien fertelde er de wierheid.
I'm still not sure exactly how that will work.	Ik bin noch net wis krekt hoe't dat sil wurkje.
I realized that long ago	Ik realisearre dat lang lyn
She did the only thing she could think of.	Se die it iennichste wat se tinke koe.
She's not happy.	Se is net bliid.
Until next week !.	Oant nije wike!.
Maybe this will work.	Miskien sil dit wurkje.
It just has to happen pretty quickly too.	It moat gewoan ek moai gau barre.
I'll get used to it.	Ik sil der wol oan wenne.
It's probably not even true.	It is wierskynlik net iens wier.
He just does not know it yet.	Hy wit it gewoan noch net.
With it not being held against them.	Mei it net tsjin har hâlden wurde.
He was really happy about that.	Dêr wie er echt bliid om.
We were ready and we were a lot.	Wy wiene klear en wy wiene in protte.
That was how he knew she would be here.	Dat wie hoe't hy wist dat se hjir wêze soe.
Now look at you.	Sjoch no nei dy.
I would have told him he had no worries	Ik soe him sein hawwe dat er gjin soargen hie
It's not home to me anymore.	It is my net mear thús.
I need you to see something.	Ik haw jo nedich om wat te sjen.
I am going to.	Ik sil.
Maybe not in a bad way.	Miskien net op in minne manier.
You might not of course.	Jo miskien net fansels.
It soon became her life.	It waard al gau har libben.
Does none of those things.	Docht gjin fan dy dingen.
I need to see them.	Ik moat se sjen.
Would not be the only one.	Soe net it iennichste wêze.
We must keep our word.	Wy moatte ús wurd hâlde.
I wanted to say it	Ik woe it sizze
Of course, the people who are here want to be bad.	Fansels wolle de minsken dy't hjir binne min wêze.
I was just in time.	Ik wie krekt op tiid.
I wondered if it always would	Ik frege my ôf oft it altyd soe
I want to get out of there first	Dat wol ik der earst wol út
Is too good to pass up.	Is te goed om troch te gean.
I would not yet.	Ik soe noch net.
We do not have to make it better.	Wy hoege it net better te meitsjen.
But this woman would have nothing to do with it.	Mar dizze frou soe der neat fan hawwe.
She had to be home with the kids.	Se moast thús wêze mei de bern.
But I can not work it out.	Mar ik kin it net wurkje.
Otherwise we have what we have.	Oars hawwe wy wat wy hawwe.
I'm trying to do just that	Ik besykje dat krekt te dwaan
It just works well.	It wurket gewoan goed.
Or even a class.	Of sels in klasse.
Everything is fine now.	Alles is no goed.
Do this once or twice a week.	Doch dit ien of twa kear yn 'e wike.
I want you with my everything	Ik wol dy mei myn alles
I have to make it hard	Ik moat it dreech meitsje
I already know what you're all saying about me	Ik wit al wat jo allegear oer my sizze
I'm going on	Ik gean troch
I expected more from this person	Ik ferwachte mear fan dizze persoan
I thought she actually looked a little tired	Ik tocht dat se eins in bytsje wurch like
We do the same.	Wy dogge itselde.
I got them just last week	Ik krige se krekt ferline wike
I'm not getting in there.	Ik kom der net yn.
I could not let you know yet	Ik koe dy noch net litte witte
But it's just a movie.	Mar it is mar in film.
I just did not have time.	Ik haw gewoan gjin tiid hân.
There was much more.	Der wie noch folle mear.
They say it's about food.	Se sizze dat it om iten giet.
Who knows what he thought.	Wa wit wat er tocht.
I should have told her	Ik hie it har fertelle moatten
If you win in the morning, you win the day.	As jo ​​​​de moarn winne, winne jo de dei.
But then again, maybe not.	Mar dan wer, miskien net.
That way, people can think what they want.	Sa kinne minsken tinke wat se wolle.
I knew her name, but she did not know	Ik wist har namme, mar dat wist se net
I should have known.	Ik hie witte moatten.
I, of course, knew who he was, but had never met him.	Ik, fansels, wist wa't er wie, mar hie nea moete him.
This will really take two people.	Dit sil echt twa minsken nimme.
She could still see her.	Se koe har noch sjen.
I think it's for the best.	Ik tink dat it foar it bêste is.
It worked for me.	It die foar my.
I would not even do the same	Ik soe sels net itselde dwaan
She was as much like me.	Se wie safolle as my.
You had a mother and a father.	Do hiest in mem en in heit.
I've told you that before.	Dat haw ik dy earder sein.
They are asking to help them now.	Se freegje om har no te helpen.
I did not intend to do this	Ik wie net fan plan dit te dwaan
There must be a reason why she came back here.	Der moat in reden wêze wêrom't se hjir werom kaam.
I do not know where it is.	Ik wit net wêr't it is.
I did it differently	Ik die it oars
You had your chance.	Jo hiene jo kâns.
I'm really looking forward to next weekend	Ik sjoch echt út nei takom wykein
That was my plan too.	Dat wie myn plan ek.
For hours he talked to her, when she was well.	Oeren prate er mei har, as se goed wie.
There seemed to be no way out.	Der like gjin wei út.
That was the next thing to do.	Dat wie it folgjende ding te dwaan.
It can do that.	It kin dat dwaan.
I was almost sure it was	Ik wie hast wis dat it wie
I sat and expected him to take a seat.	Ik siet en ferwachte dat er in sit soe nimme.
Leave it at that.	Lit it der by.
And he knows it's exactly who he expected it to be.	En hy wit dat it krekt is wa't hy ferwachte dat it wie.
Then we'll see what happens.	Dan sille wy sjen wat der bart.
I saw this as an opportunity	Ik seach dit as in kâns
I was even kind to him	Ik wie sels aardich tsjin him
I had many friends	Ik hie in protte freonen
I'm totally through with this city	Ik bin hielendal troch mei dizze stêd
She was a child.	Se wie in bern.
And then we wait some more.	En dan wachtsje wy noch wat.
I would see him every now and then.	Ik soe him sa no en dan sjen.
We want to keep him	Wy wolle him hâlde
They have no children.	Se hawwe gjin bern.
Whether she wants it there or not.	Oft se it dêr wol of net.
This kind of thing.	Dit soarte fan dingen.
I thought of you as a couple, and to see you together	Ik tocht oan dy as pear, en om jo tegearre te sjen
I did not expect much	Ik hie net folle ferwachte
He would be tough though.	Hy soe wol hurd wêze.
I can not speak the words	Ik kin de wurden net prate
I did not like it, or him	Ik mocht it net, of him
That does not hold a woman.	Dat hâldt in frou net.
I know you were not.	Ik wit dat jo net wiene.
I could not go to school	Ik koe net nei skoalle
Remember that.	Tink dêr oan.
And you had to know your place.	En do moast dyn plak witte.
I was not there.	Ik wie der net.
They think you have.	Se tinke dat jo hawwe.
I could not know why	Ik koe net witte wêrom
I wonder what ever happened to him ?.	Ik freegje my ôf wat der ea mei him bard is?.
You have a family.	Jo hawwe in famylje.
I knew my time was up	Ik wist dat myn tiid om wie
I just talked to you	Ik haw krekt mei dy praat
This was his whole family too.	Dit wie ek syn hiele famylje.
It goes to the house.	It giet nei it hûs.
I looked cautiously around me	Ik seach foarsichtich om my hinne
But that was not enough for this young woman.	Mar dat wie net genôch foar dizze jonge frou.
They play really so well together.	Se spylje echt sa goed tegearre.
Was he being.	Wie hy wêzen.
No good things will come of it.	Dêr sille gjin goede dingen fan komme.
I gave up and let it go	Ik joech op en liet it gean
I thought we would be over there by now	Ik tocht dat wy dêr no wol oer wêze soene
I think we might have a chance	Ik tink dat wy miskien in kâns hawwe
Make me happy.	Meitsje my leuk.
There is something more to do.	Der is wat mear te meitsjen.
I have no idea what happened to him	Ik ha gjin idee wat der mei him bard is
When it came out, no worries.	As it der út gie, gjin soargen.
I was not really sure who or even what he was	Ik wie net echt wis wa't of sels wat hy wie
But they have just become.	Mar it binne gewoan wurden.
And that was that.	En dat wie dat.
I've never heard of him	Ik haw noch nea fan him heard
I was not ready for you.	Ik wie net klear foar dy.
It's just not fun.	It is gewoan net leuk.
I could not help it.	Ik koe it net helpe.
But now she had to find a place for her.	Mar no moast se plak fine foar har.
Only the best.	Allinnich de bêste.
There is only one problem.	Der is mar ien probleem.
They need to know.	Se moatte witte.
The pain is just as real.	De sear is like echt.
I'm ready to take him in	Ik bin ree om him yn te nimmen
It's too good to be true.	It is te moai om wier te wêzen.
You may well believe what you believe.	Jo kinne goed leauwe wat jo leauwe.
I have to ask you something	Ik moat dy wat freegje
Sure enough, that's exactly what happened to me.	Wis genôch, dat is krekt wat my bard.
I need the job.	Ik haw de baan nedich.
I'm just tired of this life.	Ik bin gewoan wurch fan dit libben.
I will always be early	Ik sil altyd betiid wêze
I was surprised that he even spoke to me	Ik wie ferrast dat hy sels tsjin my praat
Maybe this will help.	Miskien sil dit helpe.
I still know some things	Ik wit noch wat dingen
We can not go under there.	Wy kinne der net ûnder.
I was waiting for you	ik wachte op dy
Maybe it's good.	Miskien is it goed.
She opened it.	Se die it iepen.
I can not help but believe it	Ik kin it net oars as se leauwe
I have done nothing to you nor to you.	Ik haw neat dien oan dy noch tsjin dy.
I took it away but was seen	Ik naam it fuort mar waard sjoen
He's pretty happy with it though.	Hy is hjir wol aardich bliid mei.
They keep it through.	Se hâlde it troch.
We need to find them.	Wy moatte har fine.
You can not really work them.	Jo kinne se net echt wurkje.
Good to see them.	Goed om se te sjen.
I'm fine without.	Ik bin goed sûnder.
I have my kids back	Ik haw myn bern werom
In the office.	Yn it kantoar.
I have a lot.	Ik haw in protte.
I should have returned it, but did not.	Ik hie it werom moatten, mar die net.
He just hoped this would not be a girl.	Hy hope mar dat dizze gjin famke wêze soe.
I had never seen this guy before	Ik hie dizze keardel noch noait earder sjoen
She liked to be a mother.	Se mocht graach mem wêze.
But she is long gone.	Mar se is al lang fuort.
I was really worried	Ik wie echt soargen
So they try to help him.	Sa besykje se him te helpen.
I did not meet them for too long either	Ik kaam se ek net nei te lang tsjin
Money is not the problem.	Jild is net it probleem.
Well, remember that.	No, tink der oan.
Make that what you want.	Meitsje fan dat wat jo wolle.
I just wanted you to hold me back	Ik woe gewoan dat jo my werom hâlde
She only wanted the best for me.	Se woe allinnich it bêste foar my.
We'm getting through.	Wy komme troch.
I knew it was not the same as people here	Ik wist dat it net itselde wie as minsken hjir
Just what he needed.	Krekt wat er nedich hie.
Take it all back	Nim it hielendal werom
And so do they.	En dat hawwe se ek.
He also always did it with the kids.	Hy die it ek altyd mei de bern.
He just did it.	Hy die dit net.
He did just that.	Hy die krekt.
That made me a little better.	Dat makke my in bytsje better.
I'll speak for you.	Ik sil foar dy prate.
I believe my parents were scared of it themselves	Ik leau dat myn âlden it sels bang wiene
He needs someone to look after him.	Hy hat ien nedich om nei him te sjen.
Will be back again.	Sil wer werom.
I was afraid of nothing	Ik wie bang foar neat
We need you too.	Wy hawwe jo ek nedich.
I quickly went to my car	Ik gie gau nei myn auto
If it's wrong, it's wrong.	As it ferkeard is, is it ferkeard.
Have a good time !.	Hawwe in goede tiid!.
I took a day off from work	Ik naam in dei frij fan it wurk
I think he's a little scared to see you here	Ik tink dat er in bytsje bang is om dy hjir te sjen
But only a little.	Mar mar in bytsje.
I do not wish that on anyone	Dat winskje ik gjinien ta
Probably won't be back for hours.	Wierskynlik sil net werom foar oeren.
It's been a long time.	It is al lang lyn.
You're a good one.	Do bist in goede ien.
I want everything you've given me so far and more	Ik wol alles wat jo my oant no ta jûn hawwe en mear
If you can make it, you have made it.	As jo ​​​​it meitsje kinne, hawwe jo it makke.
She still wished she could see him.	Se woe noch dat se him sjen koe.
There were many.	Der wiene in protte.
I tried not to be difficult	Ik besocht net dreech te wêzen
I think this is another first for me	Ik tink dat dit in oare earste foar my is
I'm home tomorrow and then we'll talk	Ik bin moarn thús en dan sille wy prate
I would probably have to go	Ik soe wierskynlik moatte gean
Nobody said anything to me.	Nimmen sei wat tsjin my.
I told you something to do.	Ik sei dy wat te dwaan.
I had no idea.	Ik hie gjin idee.
I think you should go	Ik tink dat jo moatte gean
I was a different person	Ik wie in oare persoan
There was time for only one thing.	Der wie tiid foar mar ien ding.
I'll just put that out there.	Dat sil ik der mar út sette.
This is not good.	Dit is net goed.
I did not want to wake anyone up	Ik woe net elkenien wekker meitsje
She does not matter.	Se makket neat út.
I'll see you there, soon	Ik sjoch dy dêr, gau
It seems to me to help for some reason.	It liket my om ien of oare reden te helpen.
You are not good.	Jo binne net goed.
We never said it.	Wy hawwe it noait sein.
I do not believe that.	Dat leau ik net.
I should get him soon	Ik soe him gau komme moatte
She did not even know who his father was.	Se wist net iens wa't syn heit wie.
Nothing happened, that was good.	Der barde neat, dat wie goed.
You have to be the one doing the talking, not him.	Jo moatte dejinge wêze dy't it praten docht, net hy.
Your question here is better.	Jo fraach hjir is better.
I want to do something good	Ik wol wat goed dwaan
She would not.	Se soe net.
I could not think why	Ik koe net tinke wêrom
But now we can have the next best thing.	Mar no kinne wy ​​​​it folgjende bêste ding hawwe.
Maybe he should tell it to someone.	Miskien moat er it ien fertelle.
He had not read anything from me.	Hy hie neat fan my lêzen.
Her words, not mine.	Har wurden, net myn.
Life is good now.	It libben is no goed.
I'm doing a job now that I love it	Ik doch in baan no dat ik hâld
To go on and on.	Om troch te gean en troch te gean.
I did not expect that	Dat hie ik net ferwachte
That's what I'll give you	Dat sil ik dy jaan
It was definitely good to see someone you know here.	It wie wis goed om ien te sjen dy't jo hjir ken.
His house was not a house without her.	Syn hûs wie gjin hûs sûnder har.
I need to know what's going on	Ik moat witte wat der bart
I wanted him to look away from me	Ik woe dat er fan my ôf seach
You could only have one.	Jo koene mar ien hawwe.
Do what you have to do.	Doch wat jo dwaan moatte.
It felt good to say it.	It fielde goed om it te sizzen.
It stops for nothing.	It hâldt foar neat op.
I wish you were here to see it	Ik winskje dat jo hjir wiene om it te sjen
I know you can do better	Ik wit dat jo better kinne
They should not do that.	Dat moatte se net dwaan.
But it was not one of those things.	Mar it wie net ien fan dizze dingen.
We hope you do not get the chance to find out.	Wy hoopje dat jo net de kâns krije om út te finen.
I'm not either.	Ik bin ek net.
I tried to tell her	Ik besocht it har te fertellen
I wish my first time would be him	Ik woe dat myn earste kear him wêze soe
And we have not seen them yet.	En dy ha wy noch net sjoen.
Her work is hard.	Har wurk is hurd.
It has been such a day.	It hat sa'n dei west.
I would know.	Ik soe it witte.
We are here to do the latter.	Wy binne hjir om it lêste te dwaan.
I knew you would not let us down	Ik wist dat jo ús net litte litte
I have no idea why he's here	Ik ha gjin idee wêrom't hy hjir is
I have a place in the city	Ik haw in plak yn 'e stêd
I should have said it that night too	Ik hie it dy jûn ek sizze moatten
Almost anyone can go and talk to him.	Hast elkenien kin mei him gean en prate.
I needed to know if	Ik moast witte oft
I'm not surprised.	Ik bin net ferrast.
Let well remain so.	Lit goed sa bliuwe.
I love you more than life	Ik hâld fan dy mear as it libben
To become nothing is the door to truth.	Om neat te wurden is de doar nei wierheid.
It went up pretty well.	It rûn aardich goed op.
I was not hurt.	Ik wie net sear.
She kept trying.	Se bleau besykje.
Three for his mother.	Trije foar syn mem.
I could not see anything yet	Ik koe noch neat sjen
It's very difficult to.	It is hiel dreech om.
I now realized that it was also my home	Ik realisearre my no dat it ek myn thús wie
I just want you to love me	Ik wol gewoan dat jo fan my hâlde
You just have to have them.	Jo moatte se gewoan hawwe.
I really had no reason to be there	Ik hie echt gjin reden om dêr te wêzen
I'm too old for you.	Ik bin te âld foar dy.
He has not been on since.	Hy is sûnt net op west.
I had to work.	Ik moast wurkje.
I'm not telling you what to do.	Ik fertel dy net wat te dwaan.
He says to himself.	Hy seit tsjin himsels.
She's been a week or so away, but she's back now.	Se is in wike as wat fuort, mar se is no werom.
Other than that, she felt the same as me.	Oars as dat fielde se itselde as my.
I would know.	Ik soe it witte.
We'll see what happens.	Wy sille sjen wat der komt.
They were also not too careful.	Se wiene ek net te foarsichtich.
But she said nothing.	Mar se sei neat.
I'm glad you're back	Ik bin bliid dat jo werom binne
I did nothing wrong	Ik haw neat ferkeard dien
Nobody gets sick.	Nimmen wurdt siik.
But that does not have to be the case.	Mar dat hoecht net sa troch te gean.
That's what I would like	Dat soe ik graach wolle
We need to do something good.	Wy moatte wat goed dwaan.
Life was too busy for that.	Dêr wie it libben te drok foar.
I could not eat for almost a month	Ik koe hast in moanne net ite
He needs to get himself in hand.	Hy moat himsels yn 'e hân krije.
Children really.	Bern echt.
It was something everyone could do.	It wie wat elkenien koe dwaan.
I did not read them well	Ik haw se net goed lêzen
It was not enough.	It wie net genôch.
I was up early.	Ik wie betiid op.
I know of this place	Ik wit fan dit plak
I felt what he did not say	Ik fielde wat er net sei
I have seen this too often.	Ik haw dit te faak sjoen.
I want to help keep it going	Ik wol helpe om it te hâlden
Someone with something to say.	Immen mei wat te sizzen.
That could not.	Dat koe net.
I do not work like that.	Ik wurkje net sa.
She knew what it was.	Se wist wat it wie.
Just get out of there.	Gean der mar út.
Se sil gau.	Se sil gau.
I'll show him he can do it.	Ik sil him sjen litte dat hy it kin.
I wish it hadn’t come that way	Ik woe dat it net sa kommen wie
The boy knows everything.	De jonge kin alles.
I would very much like that.	Dat soe ik hiel graach wolle.
You want both.	Jo wolle beide.
Here it is no different.	Hjir is it net oars.
Well, maybe not wait.	No, miskien net wachtsje.
There was still so much to look forward to.	Der wie noch safolle om nei út te sjen.
I've never been easy since.	Ik wie noait maklik sûnt.
I have some idea what it would take to 'make it'.	Ik haw wat idee wat it soe nimme om 'it te meitsjen'.
I think life is good	Ik tink dat it libben goed is
I had been away for a week	Ik wie in wike fuort west
People had heard.	Minsken hiene heard.
And he the net.	En hy die net.
I want him to show me how it can be done	Ik wol dat er my sjen lit hoe't it kin
I should be, but the money would not stay, somehow	Ik soe wêze moatte, mar it jild soe net bliuwe, ien of oare manier
I think you have to believe it.	Ik tink dat jo it leauwe moatte.
He never said a word or anything.	Hy hat noait in wurd of neat sein.
I wish the whole family would do it with me	Ik woe dat de hiele famylje it mei my dwaan soe
I have to be with him now.	Ik moat no by him wêze.
It does not work very well.	It wurket net hiel goed.
She could see where he was going with this.	Se koe sjen wêr't er mei dit hinne soe.
I did not tell him the other things that were done	Ik fertelde him de oare dingen dy't dien wiene net
You did well there.	Do bist der goed dien.
I just thought they would not know	Ik tocht gewoan dat se it net witte soene
I can not find it	Ik kin it net fine
But not true.	Mar net wier.
You will see that soon.	Dat sille jo gau sjen.
I was too scared to look back	Ik wie te bang om werom te sjen
You win, okay.	Jo winne, goed.
Not again man.	Net wer man.
I just got the place	Ik haw krekt it plak
He did not touch her once.	Hy rekke har net ien kear oan.
It does not matter to her how and where.	It makket har neat oer hoe en wêr.
I got sick of taking them	Ik waard siik fan nimme se
I told him to take it back, but he did not want to	Ik sei tsjin him om it werom te nimmen, mar hy woe net
To do this you need to keep them.	Om dit te dwaan moatte jo se hâlde.
But not quite yet.	Mar noch net hielendal.
And I just in a good way.	En ek net op in goede manier.
I would not know.	Ik soe it net witte.
I may need a hand.	Ik kin in hân nedich hawwe.
I take her to him.	Ik nim har nei him ta.
I did not need any friends	Ik hie gjin freonen nedich
You did not think it would happen.	Do hiest net tocht datst der dan troch komme soe.
I looked out for him	Ik seach foar him út
Where has she been.	Wêr hat se.
Maybe she could do it now.	Miskien koe se it no.
I did not like it when she did this	Ik fûn it net leuk doe't se dit die
I could see them so clearly	Ik koe se sa dúdlik sjen
I wondered who had done that	Ik frege my ôf wa't dat dien hie
But he knew I was happy to give him things.	Mar hy wist, dat it my bliid wie him dingen te jaan.
She says nothing happened.	Se seit dat der neat mei bard is.
Anyway, it's nice to talk to you.	Hoe dan ek, it is aardich mei dy te praten.
It has been him all a bit.	It hat him allegear in bytsje west.
He was still the same, she was still the same to him.	Hy wie noch altyd deselde, se wie noch deselde foar him.
This could never get old	Dit koe nea âld wurde
I need you to remove it all	Ik haw jo nedich om it allegear fuort te meitsjen
That I could have with him	Dat koe ik mei him ha
This is not just me.	Dit is net allinnich ik.
It could not have gone better.	It koe net better gean.
Nothing to do.	Neat te dwaan.
Up and away.	Op en fuort.
I just wanted to get him back here	Ik woe him hjir mar werom krije
They take care of their parents.	Se soargje foar har âlden.
I did not know anyone was coming into my family	Ik wist net dat der ien yn myn famylje kaam
That's what we want.	Dat wolle wy.
Who is her too.	Wa is har ek.
You tell me if this is right or wrong.	Jo fertelle my as dit goed of ferkeard is.
It may not always be so.	It kin net altyd sa wêze.
I'll make time.	Ik sil tiid meitsje.
Here's the reason why it is not.	Hjir is de reden wêrom't it net is.
I could not believe what he was doing	Ik koe net leauwe wat er die
I might get home soon	Ik kom miskien gau thús
There are never more than you two.	D'r binne noait mear as jo twa.
But it was I who went first.	Mar it wie ik dy't earst gie.
Home from home.	Thús út hûs.
He can do more.	Hy kin mear.
I would have loved to have seen her	Ik hie har graach sjoen
I just wasn't sure about him yet.	Ik wie gewoan noch net wis fan him.
I had no idea why this was	Ik hie gjin idee wêrom dit wie
Think of the people.	Tink oan de minsken.
I was no longer a child	Ik wie gjin bern mear
I would become a teacher	Ik soe learaar wurde
She was waiting for it.	Se wachte der op.
What did he look like differently.	Wat seach er der oars út.
No matter how hard he hit.	Hoe hurd hy ek rekke wurde soe.
It could work.	It koe wurkje.
Or maybe he just wanted it ready.	Of miskien woe er gewoan dat dit klear wie.
Everything a man can do, a woman can do too.	Alles wat in man kin, kin in frou ek dwaan.
I'm more than happy to have them here	Ik bin mear dan bliid dat se hjir komme
I'm pretty sure you do not like it	Ik bin der hast wis fan dat jo it net leuk fine
I want to see you	Ik wol dy komme sjen
I'm so happy for you, friend	Ik bin sa bliid foar dy, freon
I want our time together first	Ik wol earst ús tiid tegearre
I would not tell her	Ik soe it har net fertelle
He has it hard too.	Hy hat it ek dreech.
The one he had been.	Dejinge dy't er west hie.
I never want to go down again.	Ik wol noait wer ûnder.
But for me, that's not my problem.	Mar foar my is dat net myn probleem.
Now in bed.	No op bêd.
I ask for a word with my husband	Ik freegje in wurd mei myn man
I'm told.	It is my ferteld.
He probably felt nothing.	Hy fielde wierskynlik neat.
I had no idea if he heard me	Ik hie gjin idee oft er my hearde
We can talk.	Wy kinne prate.
I just got word	Ik haw krekt wurd krigen
It already happened.	It barde al.
Maybe it's true.	Miskien is it wier.
I think he's there now	Ik tink dat hy der no is
But let's not do it now.	Mar litte wy it no net dwaan.
He was better than that.	Hy wie better as dat.
I found this to be true late in life	Ik fûn dit te wêzen wier let yn it libben
I'm angry at her.	Ik bin lilk op har.
I asked what the truth was.	Ik frege wat de wierheid wie.
I'm at one o'clock.	Ik bin op oere ien.
Better go.	Better geane.
I was not really sure.	Ik wie der net echt wis fan.
I was just a kid, too	Ik wie mar in bern, te
But this was just a party.	Mar dit wie mar in feest.
But that's of course.	Mar dat die se fansels.
My dad told me to do this.	Myn heit fertelde my dit te dwaan.
She had none.	Se hie gjin.
I was gone.	Ik wie fuort.
I walked into the office	Ik rûn it kantoar yn
We just love each other.	Wy hâlde gewoan fan elkoar.
I also did not eat anything	Ik ha ek neat iten
A friend money.	In freon jild.
Well done !.	Goed dien !.
I will see that you have what you need	Ik sil sjen dat jo hawwe wat jo nedich hawwe
I could see the hand.	Ik koe de hân sjen.
I knew exactly where I needed to go	Ik wist krekt wêr't ik hinne moast
Doesn't matter much now.	Makket no net folle út.
I hope you make them sure.	Ik hoopje dat jo har der wis fan meitsje.
It's neither good nor bad.	It is net goed noch min.
I want this more than anything	Ik wol dit mear as wat dan ek
See below.	Sjoch dêr ûnder.
I think back to when it could have happened	Ik tink werom oan doe't it koe barre
It will be good.	It sil goed wêze.
No other words, those are the words.	Gjin oare wurden, dat binne de wurden.
Something would happen.	Der soe wat barre.
I just can not be with you again	Ik kin gewoan net wer by dy wêze
But it will not make you happy.	Mar it sil jo net bliid meitsje.
That's what I would have told myself	Dat soe ik my sein hawwe
However, he was having a hard time.	Hoe dan ek, hy hie it dreech.
I will not ask you for that anymore.	Ik sil dy der net mear nei freegje.
I was ready to record	Ik wie klear om op te nimmen
It had to be him.	It moast hy wêze.
She's probably good.	Se is wierskynlik goed.
I want to say a few words to you	Ik wol dy in pear wurden sizze
I needed to know where she had been	Ik moast witte wêr't se west hie
Everyone has a past.	Elkenien hat in ferline.
I just had a question.	Ik hie krekt in fraach.
I would love to stop taking them	Ik soe graach ophâlde mei it nimmen fan se
She has it.	Se hat it.
I heard nothing.	Ik hearde neat.
Nothing will happen to you here.	Hjir sil neat mei dy barre.
It came back now.	It kaam no werom.
I was happy for him and told him that	Ik wie bliid foar him en fertelde him dat
He had heard his name clearly.	Hy hie syn namme dúdlik heard.
Sure, sure, that must be it.	Wis, wis, dat moat it wêze.
I could not want anything more	Ik koe neat mear wolle
Do what you have to.	Doch wat jo moatte.
We're pretty good friends.	Wy binne aardich goede freonen.
I hope they can help in some way.	Ik hoopje dat se op ien of oare manier kinne helpe.
I did not know what to say to him	Ik wist net wat ik him sizze moast
His hand.	Syn hân.
I've never had a boy in my bed before	Ik haw noch nea in jonge op myn bêd hân
I tell her everything.	Ik fertel har alles.
So it would be.	Sa soe it wêze.
You may be the first in your family to go to school.	Jo kinne de earste yn jo famylje wêze om nei skoalle te gean.
I thought she would be here	Ik tocht dat se hjir wêze soe
You may have to let one or two other things go.	Jo moatte miskien ien of twa oare dingen gean litte.
I still know something	Ik wit noch wat
I did not know he was there	Ik wist net dat er der wie
I myself was not quite sure yet.	Ik wie der sels noch net hielendal wis fan.
They work against the people.	Se wurkje tsjin de minsken.
I can do nothing for you today	Ik kin hjoed neat foar dy dwaan
I'm going on.	Ik gean troch.
That's what I did	Dat haw ik dien
They do not leave on time.	Se geane net op tiid fuort.
We had nothing to do with it.	Wy hiene der neat oan.
These people are my friends.	Dizze minsken binne myn freonen.
What has been done.	Wat dien is.
What was good had to be done	Wat goed wie, moast dien wurde
We will not talk about it.	Wy sille der net oer prate.
I think your way is so much better	Ik tink dat jo manier sa better is
I wonder if my mother knew him at one time	Ik freegje my ôf oft myn mem him op ien kear koe
I'm actually surprised she's still with me	Ik bin eins ferrast dat se noch by my is
I indicate where the work will be done	Ik jou oan wêr't it wurk dien wurde sil
I got tired of life	Ik waard wurch fan it libben
I gave you everything	Ik joech dy alles
This will be done.	Dit sil dien wurde.
And she seems to be coming back for more.	En se liket werom te kommen foar mear.
He was here early.	Hy wie hjir betiid.
I think it works better now.	Ik tink dat it no better wurket.
I love being with him	Ik hâld fan wêzen mei him
She saw the whole thing.	Se seach it hiele ding.
A friend of a friend	In freon fan in freon
I just did not think about it	Ik tocht der gewoan net oan
I would never have expected this	Ik soe nea hawwe ferwachte dit
I could not find a reason not to do it	Ik koe gjin reden fine om it net te dwaan
I asked him where the food was	Ik frege him wêr't it iten wie
Looked at me.	Seach nei my ta.
Well, he said, it's gone.	No, sei er, it is fuort.
I quickly looked away	Ik seach gau fuort
But no one could find them.	Mar nimmen koe se fine.
Wish we had.	Wolle wy hiene.
I had to see him first	Ik moast him earst sjen
But then, maybe they did.	Mar dan, miskien die se.
I need to know where you want to go	Ik moat witte wêr't jo hinne wolle
Go back home.	Gean werom nei hûs.
When you'm home.	Wannear bist thús.
I work better alone.	Ik wurkje better allinnich.
He was as good or better than them.	Hy wie like goed of better as se.
I really did not think so	Dat tocht ik eins net
I'm giving you up	Ik jou dy op
I was not there and no one told me much	Ik wie der net en gjinien hat my folle ferteld
I will never make it home.	Ik sil nea meitsje it thús.
I hope they are happy.	Ik hoopje dat se bliid binne.
That I would not say	Dat soe ik net sizze
She can do it.	Se kin it dwaan.
They did not know that.	Dat wisten se net.
Now she can not say that you have not tried.	No kin se net sizze dat jo net besocht hawwe.
I still remember, this other guy	Ik wit noch, dizze oare keardel
Not so bad, actually.	Net sa min, eins.
Not a man.	Net in man.
I walked over to him.	Ik rûn nei him ta.
Or maybe he has.	Of miskien hat er.
She could not ask for more from a man.	Mear koe se fan in man net freegje.
Making good time so far.	It meitsjen fan goede tiid oant no ta.
I was not trying to hurt you	Ik besocht jo net sear te meitsjen
And he would do it too.	En hy soe it ek dwaan.
I really thought it was you	Ik tocht echt dat it jo wiene
She did not expect me to return so early.	Se ferwachte my net sa betiid werom.
That was nothing, she said.	Dat wie neat, sei se.
I think a lot of people have to deal with it.	Ik tink dat in protte minsken der mei te krijen hawwe.
Be a new person.	Wês in nije persoan.
In fact, he did not even know it.	Eins wist er it sels net iens.
Then he says, come on.	Dan seit er, kom op.
There were no children in the place.	Der wiene gjin bern yn it plak.
That would have been nice.	Dat hie wol moai west.
I think she's doing it really well	Ik tink dat se it echt goed docht
I want to stay with her	Ik wol by har bliuwe
But it is not enough.	Mar it is net genôch.
I do not know if that is a problem.	Ik wit net oft dat in probleem is.
I need to know what happens then	Ik moat witte wat der dan bart
It really worked.	It wurke echt.
I had never thought of that before	Dêr hie ik noch noait earder oan tocht
So angry, almost all the time.	Sa lilk, hast de hiele tiid.
I will not leave this.	Ik sil dit net litte.
You did not tell him that before, and you tell him so now.	Dat hiene jo him net earder sein, en dat sizze jo him no.
They were pretty open about it.	Se wiene der frij iepen oer.
I knew you would find him	Ik wist dat jo him fine soene
Everyone would be tired.	Elkenien soe wurch wêze.
I've always told you the truth	Ik haw jo altyd de wierheid ferteld
Everyone was with us or against us.	Elkenien wie mei ús of tsjin ús.
I could not believe this	Ik koe dit net leauwe
He must have something to look forward to.	Hy moat wat te sjen hawwe.
Talk to just a few people.	Praat mar mei in pear minsken.
No one ever had to say it.	Nimmen moast it oait sizze.
I know.	Wit ik.
He also did not get one.	Hy krige ek net ien.
I'm a girl of open mind	Ik bin in famke fan iepen gedachten
Maybe that would have been enough.	Miskien hie dat genôch west.
I will take care of my wife.	Ik sil foar myn frou soargje.
And so it must be from now on.	En sa moat it fan no ôf.
I waited until it came to me	Ik wachte oant it foar my kaam
I let you go now	Ik lit dy no gean
I do not let it happen	Ik lit it net barre
Who could it be otherwise.	Wa soe it oars wêze kinne.
I thought he would get angry	Ik tocht dat er lilk wurde soe
But something was not told.	Mar wat waard net ferteld.
She thought he knew where they were going.	Se tocht dat er wist wêr't se hinne wiene.
I can try and work there	Ik kin besykje en wurkje dêr
Well, that's not really true.	No, dat is net echt wier.
It would be very different now.	It soe no hiel oars wêze.
I also had a father who did not want me	Ik hie ek in heit dy't my net woe
I have a good reason for this	Ik haw in goede reden foar dit
I do not want that to happen.	Ik wol net dat dat bart.
I just wish there was someone else	Ik winskje gewoan dat der immen oars wie
I did not agree.	Ik woe net iens.
I know what it was now	Ik wit wat it no wie
Being different is beautiful.	Oars wêze is moai.
I told him to take it	Ik fertelde him om it te nimmen
For my father, it was the last.	Foar myn heit wie it de lêste.
I know he came to talk to me	Ik wit dat hy kaam om mei my te praten
I looked at her for a long time, saying nothing	Ik seach har lang oan, neat te sizzen
But for me.	Mar foar my.
Whatever he does, they do.	Wat hy docht, dogge se.
I hope he had a long life	Ik hoopje dat hy in lang libben hie
I did not need you to do that	Ik hie dy net nedich om dat te dwaan
I'm coming early tomorrow.	Ik kom moarn betiid.
He had met my mother.	Hy hie myn mem moete.
I thought about it better	Ik tocht der better oer
I know your work very well	Ik ken dyn wurk hiel goed
Not even heard of.	Net iens fan heard.
That was a month ago.	Dat wie in moanne lyn.
He was just like me.	Hy wie krekt as ik.
I approached her cautiously	Ik kaam har foarsichtich oan
We never had them in mind	Wy hiene har noait yn gedachten
They never asked.	Se hawwe nea frege.
I just know he did it	Ik wit gewoan dat hy it dien hat
But we must try.	Mar wy moatte besykje.
She looked happy.	Se seach der bliid út.
You do not know how to do it right.	Jo witte net hoe't jo it goed dwaan moatte.
So it had to be.	Sa moast it wêze.
I just love that guy	Ik hâld gewoan fan dy keardel
I want everything now	Ik wol no alles
I really, really did	Ik echt, echt die
He asked for him.	Hy frege om him.
You know what to do and where to go.	Jo witte wat te dwaan en wêr't jo hinne moatte.
See that now.	Sjoch dat no.
It was so very good.	It wie sa hiel goed.
I let myself take the opportunity to see him	Ik lit my de kâns nimme om him te sjen
I know him better than anyone	Ik ken him better as immen
He did not even know there was one.	Hy wist net iens dat der ien wie.
You know it and it's said.	Jo witte it en it is sein.
I really do not see how that could have happened.	Ik sjoch echt net hoe't dat barre koe.
I said nothing yet	Ik sei noch neat
She had decided.	Se hie besletten.
I thought the words but did not say them	Ik tocht de wurden mar sei se net
It's not her money, he said, it's his.	It is har jild net, sei er, it is syn.
I also want to return for us	Ik wol ek werom foar ús
We should have been done with it a long time ago.	Wy hiene der al lang mei klear wêze moatten.
I think it was for me too	Ik tink dat it ek foar my wie
Pay that and he will come to you.	Betelje dat en hy sil by dy komme.
He knew all the time she was there, of course.	Hy wist al de tiid dat se der wie, fansels.
We need to find the place.	Wy moatte it plak fine.
I'm not happy with how my life is going.	Ik bin net bliid mei hoe't myn libben giet.
Of course I'm happy about that	Dêr bin ik fansels bliid om
They know very well what they are doing.	Se witte goed en goed wat se dogge.
You can not make it.	Jo kinne it net meitsje.
He was happy about that.	Dêr wie er bliid om.
Can't wait to come again.	Kin net wachtsje om wer te kommen.
I needed someone who knew what they were doing	Ik hie ien nedich dy't wist wat se diene
I have not been with anyone	Ik haw mei gjinien west
We all try to help	Wy besykje allegear te helpen
I think there once was	Ik tink dat der eartiids west hat
Show if you believe in me.	Lit sjen oft jo yn my leauwe.
I did all this for you	Ik die dit alles foar dy
It felt like the right thing for him	It fielde as it goede ding foar him
He knew he had no chance.	Hy wist dat er gjin kâns hie.
Something happened to him.	Der barde wat mei him.
He liked it.	Hy mocht it wol.
That gets pretty hard.	Dat wurdt moai dreech.
I just could not take it anymore	Ik koe it gewoan net mear oan
That clearly says something.	Dat seit dúdlik wat.
I know you know this.	Ik wit dat jo dit witte.
I never got there	Ik kaam der noait oan
You're alive.	Do bist yn libben.
I would not win that	Dy soe ik net winne
You never get there.	Jo komme der noait.
I could see him forever.	Ik koe him foar altyd sjen.
No one had seen it.	Nimmen hie it sjoen.
Not that she needs it.	Net dat se it nedich hat.
A chance to talk to a beautiful girl	In kâns om te praten mei in moai famke
I was not quite there yet, but soon	Ik wie der noch net hielendal, mar gau
I believe your song from other things too	Ik leau dyn liet ek fan oare dingen
Now he would visit us.	No soe er ús besykje.
It has good reason to be concerned.	It hat goede reden om soargen.
I wanted to be like her	Ik woe wêze as har
If no house.	As gjin hûs.
I wonder who that might be	Ik freegje my ôf wa't dat wêze kin
I had never done that before.	Dat hie ik noch noait earder dien.
She had to do something before it came to that.	Se hie wat dwaan moatten foardat it sa kaam.
That, of course, is why.	Dêr is it fansels foar.
They have no time for that.	Dêr ha se gjin tiid foar.
I opened the door and looked	Ik die de doar iepen en seach nei
I did not want to say anything	Ik woe neat sizze
Just do not do it again.	Doch it gewoan net wer.
Please do not talk about it here.	Praat hjir asjebleaft net oer.
But many were.	Mar in protte wiene.
But this is totally wrong.	Mar dit is hielendal ferkeard.
I saw it at home with my husband and young children.	Ik seach it thús mei myn man en jonge bern.
I believe you should take people by the hand	Ik leau dat jo minsken by de hân nimme moatte
I knew there was so much more to you	Ik wist dat d'r safolle mear oan jo wie
I looked up to the moon	Ik seach op nei de moanne
I'm like that too.	Ik bin ek sa.
I wanted to be done with all this	Ik woe mei dit alles klear wêze
We will never see the man again.	Wy sille de man nea wer sjen.
We do not think.	Wy tinke net.
That's what I should do now.	Dat soe ik no dwaan moatte.
I told her the truth	Ik fertelde har de wierheid
Maybe she's not sure.	Miskien is se der net wis fan.
It's easy to do.	It is maklik te dwaan.
I might have already	Ik hie miskien al
It looks like they did it right.	It liket derop dat se it goed dien hawwe.
I just want to talk to her again	Ik wol gewoan wer mei har prate
I have not seen it either, so	Ik haw it ek net sjoen, sa
Try to find something that said this was good.	Besykje wat te finen dat sei dat dit goed wie.
For the kids.	Foar de bern.
None of us could get enough.	Net ien fan ús koe genôch krije.
It had done its job.	It hie syn wurk dien.
In my hand.	Yn myn hân.
I have some work to do here	Ik haw hjir wat wurk te dwaan
I did not have to have anyone tell me that	Ik hoegde net ien te hawwen dy't my dat fertelde
Not often, but the opportunity is there.	Net faak, mar de kâns is der.
And then you are there.	En dan binne jo dêr.
You can see the place in the picture.	Jo kinne it plak sjen op 'e foto.
I do not think it is.	Ik tink net dat it is.
I told my parents and wife we ​​were going.	Ik fertelde myn âlden en frou dat wy geane.
And the city.	En de stêd.
I look forward to working with you soon	Ik sjoch út nei in wurk mei dy gau
I did not get the chance	Ik krige de kâns net
I would come home.	Ik soe nei hûs komme.
A friend from school	In freon fan skoalle
I have nothing for you.	Ik ha neat foar dy.
It's just the question of when and what job.	It is allinnich de fraach wannear en hokker baan.
She says he's home.	Se seit dat er thús is.
I know they want to talk to you too	Ik wit dat se ek mei dy prate wolle
I would find it hard not to do so	Ik soe it dreech fine om net te dwaan
We are so glad you are here.	Wy binne sa bliid dat jo hjir binne.
This is a difficult place.	Dit is in dreech plak.
So are we.	Sa binne wy.
Many think so.	In protte tinke dat.
Something about that.	Dêr wat oer.
I really know nothing about this.	Ik wit hjir eins neat fan.
I have tried.	Ik ha besocht.
He did not know how late it was.	Hy wist net hoe let it wie.
I felt much better now	Ik fielde my no folle better
I know a lot with a name	Ik kin in protte mei in namme
Or do not work it out.	Of wurkje it net út.
I wonder what they make of it.	Ik freegje my ôf wat se der fan meitsje.
She kept looking at the door.	Se bleau nei de doar sjen.
I found where it came from	Ik fûn wêr't it wei kaam
I should have thought of that.	Ik hie der oan tinke moatten.
It must be so.	It moat sa wêze.
I arrive cautiously	Ik kom foarsichtich oan
We'm going on.	Wy geane troch.
They are a month away.	Se binne in moanne fuort.
I did not have to see it again	Ik hoegde it net wer te sjen
What they did not do.	Wat se net diene.
Not this time or at this place.	Net dizze kear of op dit plak.
In other words, the work was done.	Mei oare wurden, it wurk wie klear.
I know he knows it	Ik wit dat hy it wit
And he felt the same.	En hy fielde itselde.
I like going to work.	Ik gean graach oan it wurk.
I think we might have to go back	Ik tink dat wy miskien werom moatte
I was free.	Ik wie frij.
He was better at that.	Dêr wie er better yn.
They did not do it for money.	Se diene it net foar jild.
But she's just a woman.	Mar se is gewoan in frou.
Come on.	Kom mar.
But she went back to see her family.	Mar se gie werom om har famylje te sjen.
She says nothing about this.	Se seit neat oer dit.
I think that was what she was waiting for	Ik tink dat it wie wêr't se op wachte
I'm not making this up.	Ik meitsje dit net op.
He started back.	Hy begûn werom.
It makes you think.	It lit jo tinke.
But no one made it a problem.	Mar nimmen makke it in probleem.
And after all, they never will.	En nei alle gedachten sille se nea.
I just kept hoping it would go away	Ik bleau mar hoopje dat it fuort soe
He would get nothing.	Hy soe neat krije.
Actually, that could work.	Eins, dat koe wurkje.
We are waiting for you in our room.	Wy wachtsje op jo yn ús keamer.
That was enough for her.	Dat wie har genôch.
Get ready to be surprised.	Meitsje jo klear om ferrast te wurden.
I've worked that out so far	Ik haw dat oant no ta wurke
I wonder is that what we are going to eat here	Ik freegje my ôf is dat wat wy hjir hinne sille ite
I thought he had another year	Ik tocht dat hy noch in jier hie
I'm sure.	Ik wis.
They had to do something.	Se hiene wat dwaan moatten.
A through and through	In troch en troch
This movie does not have them.	Dizze film hat se net.
It was so long ago.	It wie sa lang lyn.
Many people do not.	In protte minsken net.
I think everyone would just love them	Ik tink dat elkenien gewoan fan har hâlde soe
I did not realize how much it was	Ik realisearre net hoefolle it wiene
I see you again.	Ik sjoch dy wer.
I'm probably a little late	Ik bin miskien wat let
And there is a woman in this class.	En der is in frou yn dizze klasse.
I could never tell if it was good or bad	Ik koe noait sizze as it goed of min wie
I did not want him to stop	Ik woe net dat er ophâlde
I see it for the first time	Ik sjoch it foar it earst
I need to know something	Ik moat wat witte
But he wants to be.	Mar hy wol wêze.
He does not know it, and never will.	Hy wit it net, en sil nea.
I did not like the place	Ik mocht it plak net
He could not see, could not see what it was.	Hy koe net sjen, koe net sjen wat it wie.
I can get better at it	Ik kin der better yn komme
It did not go well.	It gie net goed.
He said one nice thing about me.	Hy sei ien moai ding oer my.
It's about being clear and being yourself.	It giet oer dúdlik wêze en sels wêze.
I'm actually very good at the thing	Ik bin eins hiel goed op it ding
I really like the place	Ik hâld echt fan it plak
And here are even more.	En hjir binne noch mear.
We can get hurt.	Wy kinne sear wurde.
We knew it had to come.	Wy wisten dat it komme moast.
I have to tell people	Ik moat it de minsken fertelle
I did not like it a bit	Ik fûn it net in bytsje leuk
There was still hope.	Der wie noch hope.
I'm happy to be with you	ik mei graach by dy wêze
They obviously should not have done it.	Se hiene it fansels net dwaan moatten.
Not a bad name, really.	Net in minne namme, echt.
I've always been busy, too busy.	Ik haw it altyd drok hân, te drok.
This was fine with us.	Dit wie goed mei ús.
I'm just happy to see you here	Ik bin allinnich bliid om dy hjir te sjen
No one else will.	Nimmen oars sil.
I wonder what's going on	Ik freegje my ôf wat der bart
These made it more than good.	Dizze makke it mear dan goed.
I did not like it at all	Ik mocht it hielendal net
I did not know it had been so long	Ik wist net dat it sa lang west hie
Let's go.	Lit ús gean.
I admit, you had me with you	Ik jou ta, do hiest my wol mei dy
I would have to wait.	Ik soe wachtsje moatte.
I had expected nothing from this movie before I saw it.	Ik hie neat fan dizze film ferwachte foardat ik seach.
He wanted to do some work.	Hy woe wat wurk dwaan.
I had no idea about him, really	Ik hie gjin idee oer him, echt
You should too.	Jo moatte ek.
Please.	Asjebleaft.
He did a lot of good.	Hy die in protte goed.
It's hard for me.	It is dreech foar my.
I sure hope he knew where he was going	Ik hoopje wis dat hy wist wêr't hy hinne soe
That's something late.	Dat is wat let.
A city that would never be the same	In stêd dy't nea itselde wêze soe
It occurred to me.	It kaam my op.
I wish things had been different for him	Ik woe dat dingen foar him oars west hiene
It's not hard to find.	It is net dreech te finen.
I guess they do not know either.	Ik tink dat se it ek net witte.
I was not sure how much	Ik wie net wis hoefolle
We can not have that, and you know it.	Dat kinne wy ​​net hawwe, en dat witte jo.
I do know what it is	Ik wit wol wat it is
I believe everyone does.	Ik leau dat elkenien dat docht.
It's hard.	It is dreech.
I was worried about my mother	Ik wie soargen oer myn mem
That's the office and that's the house.	Dat is it kantoar en dat is it hûs.
I have no idea what they might be	Ik haw gjin idee wat se kinne wêze
I love you so much too	Ik hâld ek sa folle fan dy
It just did not happen.	It is gewoan net bard.
I knew exactly who it was	Ik wist krekt wa't it wie
But there are some things we do not know.	Mar d'r binne wat dingen dy't wy net witte.
I have to believe something	Ik moat wat leauwe
She could not be.	Se koe net wêze.
I could not do any of that	Ik koe net ien fan dy dwaan
Everything is different now.	Alles is no oars.
I love our kids too	Ik hâld ek fan ús bern
But he kept coming.	Mar hy bleau kommen.
I think everything should be fine	Ik tink dat alles goed moat wêze
Of course, this is not the case.	Fansels is dit net sa.
Not so many questions.	Net safolle fragen.
He had done nothing wrong.	Hy hie neat ferkeard dien.
I can not believe she's really mine	Ik kin net leauwe dat se echt fan my is
I think it was time	Ik tink dat it tiid wie
I just want to go home now	Ik wol no gewoan nei hûs
We're making the whole movie in one weekend.	Wy meitsje de hiele film yn in wykein.
You want to know everything.	Jo wolle alles witte.
I want you to be happy for me	Ik wol dat jo bliid binne foar my
One two three.	Ien Twa Trije.
I never had any of that	Ik hie noait wat fan dat
I saw nothing, nothing yet	Ik seach neat, noch neat
I just will not do it.	Ik sil it gewoan net dwaan.
Of course, I did not expect that	Dat hie ik fansels net ferwachte
I was not afraid to be with her anymore	Ik wie net bang mear by har te wêzen
It worked well for me though.	It wurke wol goed foar my.
I was pretty sure of that	Dêr wie ik frij wis fan
Nothing came of it.	Der kaam neat fan.
You know nothing.	Jo witte neat.
We need someone they do not have.	Wy hawwe ien nedich dy't se net hawwe.
I'll talk to your father	Ik sil mei dyn heit prate
This is the place.	Dit is it plak.
I knew she needed me	Ik wist dat se my nedich hie
I love where this is going	Ik hâld fan wêr't dit hinne giet
Or even never started.	Of sels noait begûn.
Today it would be nothing.	Hjoed soe it neat wurde.
It will take some work.	It sil wat wurk nimme.
I wanted both, but could not either	Ik woe beide, mar koe ek net
But he kept going.	Mar hy bleau troch.
I could not be sure which one	Ik koe net wis wêze hokker
I wonder if he will even talk to me	Ik freegje my ôf oft er sels mei my prate sil
I can not help but give in	Ik kin it net helpe om yn te jaan
This time he came.	Dizze kear kaam er.
I need you to tell me the truth.	Ik haw jo nedich om my de wierheid te fertellen.
I need to know these things	Ik moat dizze dingen witte
Do it yourself.	Doch it sels.
That will happen completely.	Dat sil hielendal barre.
But the song had it wrong.	Mar it liet hie it ferkeard.
So, you know we need to go where the money is.	Dat, jo witte dat wy moatte gean wêr't it jild is.
He just loves life.	Hy hâldt gewoan fan it libben.
I think she needs it	Ik tink dat se it nedich hat
A person cannot help who they are.	In persoan kin net helpe wa't se binne.
This just does not work.	Dit wurket gewoan net.
He said it himself.	Hy sei it sels.
I'm not quite sure if this is the way to do it.	Ik bin der net hielendal wis fan oft dit de manier is om te dwaan.
I think he's been there a long time	Ik tink dat er der al lang west hat
I wanted him all the time	Ik woe him de hiele tiid hawwe
It does not matter to them who they are.	It makket har net út wa't se binne.
Now it's different.	No is it oars.
I wanted to be someone.	Ik woe immen wêze.
I thought we had it on time	Ik tocht dat wy it op 'e tiid hiene
She's not even your kind.	Se is net iens dyn soarte.
This was home, and he was here.	Dit wie thús, en hy wie hjir.
You have a month.	Jo hawwe in moanne.
Well that's it then.	No dat is it dan.
I still think you can do nothing with them	Ik tink noch altyd, dat jo mei har neat komme
He saw nothing.	Hy seach neat.
We do not know that he had such an idea.	Wy witte net dat er sa'n idee hie.
I knew that very well since I was home	Dat wist ik hiel goed sûnt dat thús wie
It's not much.	It is net folle.
I'll see it.	Ik sil it sjen.
I felt sick, and so tired	Ik fielde my siik, en sa wurch
I'm giving it back.	Ik jou it werom.
There was no bed.	Der wie gjin bêd.
I love her, but that's not her	Ik hâld fan har, mar dat is har net
It's hard to say exactly how.	It is dreech om krekt te sizzen hoe.
And he wants something more.	En hy wol wat mear.
Could be a week, could be two.	Kin in wike wêze, koe twa wêze.
I will be the best woman ever	Ik sil de bêste frou ea wêze
And people just deal with it.	En minsken dogge der gewoan mei.
I think, actually, that was the right thing to do.	Ik tink, eins, dat wie it goede ding om te dwaan.
And he sat there.	En hy siet dêr.
We hope you agree.	Wy hoopje dat jo it iens binne.
That day has not yet come.	Dy dei is noch net kommen.
Let's talk more tomorrow.	Litte wy moarn mear prate.
I assume you have.	Ik nim oan dat jo hawwe.
Let me make something of it.	Lit my der wat fan meitsje.
I needed him and he needed me	Ik hie him nedich en hy hie my nedich
All he found was truth.	Alles wat hy fûn wie wierheid.
No one would even talk to me about work.	Nimmen soe sels mei my prate oer wurk.
I knew she cared about me	Ik wist dat se om my joech
Just in a place like this.	Net op in plak as dit.
I went through all of this the first time there	Ik gie troch dit alles de earste kear dêr
You are welcome.	Graach dien.
I'm not sure if she can	Ik bin net wis oft se kin
Well, you've come to the right place.	No, jo binne op it goede plak kommen.
Not that that's a bad thing.	Net dat dat in minne ding is.
Try to make a good name for yourself.	Besykje in goede namme foar himsels te meitsjen.
I just had to say it	Ik moast it mar sizze
For you and me, of course.	Foar dy en my, fansels.
Tell us what you need.	Fertel ús wat jo nedich hawwe.
There was no one else.	Der wie gjinien oars.
I was out there myself.	Ik wie der sels út.
It's up to me.	It is oan my.
But you can see him.	Mar jo kinne him sjen.
You can do that.	Dat kinne jo dwaan.
It's the same as with you.	It is itselde as mei dy.
I went to school yesterday	Ik gie juster nei de skoalle
It was no time for a job.	It wie gjin tiid foar in baan.
She just wants you to find him.	Se wol gewoan dat jo him fine.
And things look good until they do not.	En dingen lykje goed, oant se net dogge.
And think of the money.	En tink oan it jild.
I hope this can help you.	Ik hoopje dat dit jo kin helpe.
Join my family.	Doch mei oan myn famylje.
That we can see for sure, no question.	Dat kinne wy ​​wis sjen, gjin fraach.
As it turns out, words are no longer needed.	As it sjen bart, binne wurden net mear nedich.
This one.	Dizze die.
I have no say in any of this	Ik haw gjin sizzen yn ien fan dizze
I've been waiting for you to help me.	Ik haw op jo wachte om my te helpen.
I tried it once and gave it up	Ik besocht it ien kear en joech it op
I need to talk to him before he leaves.	Ik moat mei him prate foardat hy giet.
I just really wanted to be at home with my wife	Ik woe gewoan echt thús by myn frou
She may have children, or she may not.	Se kin bern hawwe, of se kin net.
If you are not around.	As jo ​​​​net om binne.
Now it had come.	No wie it kommen.
I was not even sure	Ik wie der sels net wis fan
I did not really know what he was saying	Ik wist net echt wat er sei
You are not enough.	Jo binne net genôch.
But that is almost clear.	Mar dat is hast dúdlik.
I wanted it over	Ik woe it oer
It's not good.	It is net goed.
This did not happen	Dit is net bard
I see this happening all the time	Ik sjoch dit de hiele tiid barre
But that person would be back.	Mar dy persoan soe werom wêze.
People will say what they want to say.	Minsken sille sizze wat se sizze wolle.
Go and go.	Gean en fuort.
He is quite old.	Hy is frij âld.
Really very well done.	Echt hiel goed dien.
Love that girl.	Hâld fan dat famke.
It could be something else.	It kin wat oars wêze.
They have no more money than I do.	Se hawwe net mear jild as ik.
He had to show them.	Hy moast se sjen litte.
I talk for over an hour	Ik praat mear as in oere
I know what was going on	Ik wit wat der oan de hân wie
I felt like my mom did not want me to stop	Ik fielde dat myn mem net wolle dat ik ophâlde
It's not one of us, it's both.	It is net ien fan ús, it is beide.
We are three.	Wy binne trije.
This is something else.	Dit is wat oars.
I was not in the right place	Ik wie net op it goede plak
This does not make me happy.	Dit makket my net bliid.
I was not sure where it was	Ik wie net wis wêr't it wie
It was just such a thing.	Dit wie net sa'n ding.
He wanted something.	Hy woe wat.
I came back here and took it	Ik kaam hjir werom en naam it
They stay better if you have both in, too.	Se bliuwe better as jo hawwe beide yn, te.
You talk to him, you love him.	Jo prate mei him, jo ​​hâlde fan him.
To be open is to be nice.	Om iepen te wêzen is aardich wêze.
I could not speak.	Ik koe net prate.
It's like talking to my best friend.	It is as prate mei myn bêste freon.
I felt a little tired	Ik fielde my in bytsje wurch
We were children.	Wy wiene bern.
He sat reading it.	Hy siet it te lêzen.
I wish you did not say that	Ik winskje dat jo dat net sizze
I had been so wrong about that	Dêr hie ik sa ferkeard oer west
Believe that you can do it.	Leau dat jo it kinne.
But she could not return.	Mar se koe net werom.
I knew you did not want me	Ik wist dat jo my net wolle
Very easy to see.	Hiel maklik te sjen.
I think he's just scared	Ik tink dat er gewoan bang is
We both win.	Wy winne beide.
I'm asking you something.	Ik freegje dy wat.
I also love spending time with you	Ik hâld ek fan tiid mei dy
And that's kind of true.	En dat is in soarte fan wier.
He knew they would not be.	Hy wist dat se net wêze soene.
I had nothing to do with what happened to me	Ik hie der neat om wat my barde
We can do better than that.	Wy kinne better dwaan as dat.
I'll never talk to you	Ik sil noait mei dy prate
It was nice that someone was happy with me.	It wie moai dat immen bliid mei my wie.
He just wanted to see her.	Hy woe har mar sjen.
He could do it himself.	Hy koe it sels dwaan.
I stayed home from school that day	Ik bleau dy dei thús fan skoalle
I want you to think something	Ik wol dat jo wat tinke
I feel true.	Ik fiel my wier.
To set them free.	Om har frij te meitsjen.
I went over.	Ik gie oer.
I saw it just last week.	Ik seach it krekt ferline wike.
He left before you were even here.	Hy gie fuort foardat jo hjir sels wiene.
I did not want that, but that was the way it was.	Dat woe ik net, mar sa wie it wol.
I asked to be a woman of faith	Ik frege om in frou fan leauwe te wêzen
He may have seen something, or heard something.	Hy kin wat sjoen hawwe, of wat heard hawwe.
I went back to the office	Ik gie werom nei it kantoar
Please, no more.	Asjebleaft, net mear.
I feel like you have had enough today	Ik fiel dat jo hjoed genôch hawwe
She's scared.	Se is bang.
I can not wait to see it.	Ik kin net wachtsje om it te sjen.
When we come up with a good one, we love it.	As wy mei in goede ien komme, hâlde wy it.
I will not see them again	Ik sil se net wer sjen
I was no longer afraid of him	Ik wie net mear bang foar him
It came from me talking to him.	It kaam fan my praten tsjin him.
I wondered if he would say something	Ik frege my ôf oft er wat sizze soe
I did not even do it too badly	Ik die it sels net al te min
Or maybe they haven’t.	Of miskien hawwe se net.
I almost took off without her	Ik naam hast ôf sûnder har
I did not expect that either	Dat hie ik ek net ferwachte
I wish my life was for her	Ik winskje dat myn libben foar har wie
Anything you want to know about me, just ask.	Alles wat jo oer my witte wolle, freegje gewoan.
I would not look at him	Ik soe net nei him sjen
This is hard work.	Dit is hurd wurk.
She walked carefully across the place.	Se rûn foarsichtich oer it plak.
I was not sure what had happened	Ik wie der net wis fan wat der bard wie
That may be what's happening here.	Dat kin wêze wat hjir bart.
It's not as hard to do as you think.	It is net sa dreech om te dwaan as jo tinke.
He seemed to be afraid of no one.	Hy like foar gjinien bang te wêzen.
I should never have let you go	Ik hie dy nea gean litte moatten
We will not stop there	Dêr sille wy net mei ophâlde
Or very angry.	Of hiel lilk.
He began to worry about her.	Hy begûn har soargen te meitsjen.
I also know all the good things to say	Ik wit ek alle goede dingen om te sizzen
You tell me what you think.	Jo fertel my wat jo tinke.
I can not believe that boy I am	Ik kin net leauwe dat dy jonge ik bin
So will they.	Dat sille se ek.
No way around it.	Gjin manier om it hinne.
I would love to be with a friend	Ik soe graach by in freon wêze
Everything is fine.	Alles is goed.
I think that's clear in the here and now	Ik tink dat dat dúdlik is yn it hjir en no
I need to find her, soon	Ik moat har fine, gau
I really liked the book	Ik fûn it boek tige leuk
But it is not quite there.	Mar it is der net hielendal.
I'm just done with the story.	Ik bin krekt klear mei it fertellen.
I wonder how that comes about	Ik freegje my ôf hoe't dat komt
They had been talking for an hour or more.	Se hiene al in oere of mear praat.
I had not said a word yet	Ik hie noch gjin wurd sein
I would love for you to try it.	Ik soe graach wolle dat jo it besykje.
I should have known it was not	Ik hie witte moatten dat it it net wie
I love you as a family	Ik hâld fan dy as famylje
I had it this morning.	Ik hie it fan 'e moarn.
I do not want to believe this	Ik wol dit net leauwe
I need something else	Ik ha wat oars nedich
There is more, everyone.	Der is mear, elkenien.
You will take back your life.	Jo sille jo libben werom nimme.
I expected to see it there	Ik ferwachte it dêr te sjen
He knew it easily.	Hy koe it maklik.
It just sat there.	It siet der mar.
I did not stay here like that	Ik bleau hjir net sa
It does not come.	It komt net.
You will even find a picture of it.	Jo sille der sels in foto fan fine.
He would see her again.	Hy soe har wer sjen.
His mother never gets angry.	Syn mem wurdt noait lilk.
I gave them all my money	Ik joech se al myn jild
I did not want that girl to be anymore	Ik woe dat famke net mear wêze
My question is.	Myn fraach is.
She had to do something.	Se moast wat dwaan.
I had no idea why she did this way	Ik hie gjin idee wêrom't se op dizze manier die
We already have an idea of ​​what to do.	Wy hawwe al in idee oer wat te dwaan.
If you want to see it or maybe.	As jo ​​​​it sjen wolle of miskien.
I just wanted to stay alive and go home	Ik woe gewoan yn libben bliuwe en nei hûs gean
The whole morning was busy in my office.	De hiele moarn drok op myn kantoar.
The hair is the same.	It hier is itselde.
I had never done that to him, ever	Dat hie ik him noait dien, ea
Never had a problem.	Nea hie in probleem.
I felt happy that day	Ik fielde my bliid dy dei
There is always a reason.	Der is altyd in reden.
This will be very nice when it is ready.	Dit wurdt hiel moai as it klear is.
As if no one really knows.	As oft nimmen it echt wit.
We will be next if they are not here.	Wy sille de folgjende wêze, as se hjir net binne.
But it can not.	Mar it kin net.
I'm a very busy man	Ik bin in hiel drok man
But it has nothing to do with you.	Mar it hat neat mei dy te krijen.
That's his help.	Dat is syn help.
But you are the last.	Mar do bist de lêste.
I'll find a way home	Ik sil in wei nei hûs fine
Anyone still up? 	Immen noch op?
He gave it to you.	Hy joech it dy.
I want us to be friends	Ik wol dat wy freonen binne
He knows everything about everything.	Hy kin alles oer alles.
I have absolutely nothing against you liking it	Ik ha hielendal neat tsjin dat jo it leuk fine
Of course we did not have that.	Dat hiene wy ​​fansels net.
I think you've said enough	Ik tink dat jo genôch sein hawwe
And why did you come to me.	En wêrom bist by my kommen.
They do not speak.	Se prate net.
He had no idea what they were talking about.	Hy hie gjin idee wêr't se it oer hiene.
And people to stay.	En minsken om te bliuwen.
Living there.	Der oan wenne.
I like to do this for you	Ik doch dit graach foar dy
We did not talk about me at all.	Wy hiene it hielendal net oer my.
I looked at his hand and looked up at him	Ik seach nei syn hân en seach nei him op
That's really good.	Dat is echt goed.
I had parents, of some sort	Ik hie âlden, fan in soarte
Money comes and goes.	Jild komt en giet.
I would love to have your kids	Ik soe graach dyn bern
I'm a little tired of everyone	Ik bin in bytsje wurch fan elkenien
She wanted to be alone.	Se woe allinnich wêze.
How nice of you to help this family.	Wat aardich fan jo om dizze famylje te helpen.
I hope it would not come so	Ik hope dat it net sa komme soe
I'm doing the right thing here	Ik doch it goede ding hjir
We want to see him in two days.	Wy wolle him oer twa dagen sjen.
Now tell me what's going on.	No fertel my wat der oan de hân is.
I just want to be there for you	Ik wol der allinnich foar dy wêze
Let's get in there.	Lit ús der yn komme.
You know we have.	Jo witte dat wy hawwe.
All they needed was one more chance	Alles wat se nedich wiene wie noch ien kâns
I believe he's under a good man	Ik leau dat er ûnder in goed man is
He did not make his money alone.	Hy makke syn jild net allinnich.
I like to think of you	Ik tink der graach oan dy
I have bad hair days	Ik haw minne hier dagen
But there will be.	Mar der sil wêze.
I should not have eaten so much	Ik hie net sa folle ite moatten
That was better.	Dat wie better.
But we have to wait now.	Mar wy moatte no wachtsje.
I tried many other things	Ik besocht in protte oare dingen
I hope you know what you just did	Ik hoopje dat jo witte wat jo krekt dien hawwe
I have no idea what she was doing there	Ik ha gjin idee wat se dêr die
Dad was still gone.	Heit wie noch fuort.
No movie was made.	Gjin film waard makke.
It's good for her.	It is goed foar har.
I wanted them to be happy	Ik woe dat se bliid wêze
There seemed to be nothing.	Der like neat te wêzen.
I can not wait to see you again	Ik kin net wachtsje om dy wer te sjen
Believe me, it's true.	Leau my, it is wier.
Do whatever you want, you will never find it.	Doch wat jo wolle, jo sille it noait fine.
Someone you need to know.	Immen dy't jo witte moatte.
I think you have such a good chance as anyone	Ik tink dat jo sa'n goede kâns hawwe as elkenien
We were still alive.	Wy wiene noch yn libben.
Exactly, they are.	Krekt echt, se binne.
I will ask someone where you can get this book.	Ik sil ien freegje wêr't jo dit boek krije kinne.
I asked him what he was doing.	Ik frege him wat er die.
He had to talk.	Hy moast prate.
But not yours.	Mar net dyn.
I met your father, he was a good man	Ik moete dyn heit, hy wie in goed man
They did it too.	Se diene it ek.
But once is enough.	Mar ien kear is genôch.
A woman must eat well	In frou moat goed ite
Very sure he will have a good read.	Hiel wis dat hy in goed lêzen sil hawwe.
Nothing worked for him either, just like the other two.	By him wurke ek neat, krekt as de oare twa.
My mother was thirty when she had me.	Myn mem wie tritich doe't se my hie.
I need to know the truth	Ik moat de wierheid witte
There is not much time left.	Der is net folle tiid oer.
Whatever it was, he thought, it's gone.	Wat it ek wie, tocht er, it is fuort.
Not agreeing on this.	Net iens oer dit.
By a girl who said she loved me.	Troch in famke dat sei dat se fan my hâlde.
And if it's fun, you're doing it wrong.	En as it leuk is, dogge jo it ferkeard.
I do not see where the problem is.	Ik sjoch net wêr't it probleem is.
I just did not know how to find the words	Ik wist gewoan net hoe ik de wurden fine moast
There is still work to be done.	Der is noch wurk te dwaan.
I would love to show you around	Ik soe graach sjen litte jo hinne
She had seen him do that more than once.	Se hie him dat al mear as ien kear dwaan sjoen.
I said, what are you talking about.	Ik sei, wêr prate jo oer.
Just my thoughts for the day.	Krekt myn gedachten foar de dei.
I hope you wish it was.	Ik hoopje dat jo wolle dat it wie.
She has no husband.	Se hat gjin man.
We just did the job.	Wy hawwe krekt it wurk dien.
I had been a bad woman	Ik hie in minne frou west
They said not a word.	Se seine gjin wurd.
No more children, not even a wife yet.	Gjin bern mear, ek noch gjin frou.
Just one thing.	Krekt in ding.
Very soon, indeed.	Hiel gau, eins.
Your family needs to get back home though.	Jo famylje moat wol werom nei hûs.
That was probably the last time the door opened.	Dat wie nei alle gedachten de lêste kear dat de doar iepen gie.
I want to be more than anything to him	Ik wol mear as wat foar him wêze
We did absolutely nothing.	Wy hawwe hielendal neat dien.
And you know more than that.	En jo witte mear as dat.
I will not look at him.	Ik sil net nei him sjen.
We need help.	Wy hawwe help nedich.
I did not want to deal with you.	Ik woe net mei dy meitsje.
We will be back soon !.	Wy komme gau wer werom!.
But she loves me.	Mar se hâldt fan my.
I wonder if it's okay	Ik freegje my ôf oft it goed is
I would never see my mother again	Ik soe myn mem noait wer sjen
He had better days.	Hy hie bettere dagen hân.
That can no longer be so true.	Dat kin net mear sa wier.
It must be one of us.	It moat ien fan ús wêze.
We did not expect this.	Wy hiene dit net ferwachte.
I agree with you.	Ik bin it mei dy iens.
They had not been there yet.	Dêr wiene se noch net oan.
Everyone tried it.	Allegear besocht it.
You're here now, and there's plenty of time.	Jo binne hjir no, en der is genôch tiid.
I think she wants that too	Ik tink dat se dat ek wol
I did not know what to make of it.	Ik wist net wat ik der fan meitsje moast.
If he wants to leave, we're leaving.	As er fuort wol, dan geane wy ​​fuort.
I never do it myself	Ik doch it sels noait
I wonder if other people are going through that too	Ik freegje my ôf oft oare minsken dat ek troch geane
I need to do something right	Ik moat wat goed dwaan
And they can keep it.	En se kinne it hâlde.
I was too hard on him	Ik wie te hurd mei him
It was nice to get away.	It wie moai om fuort te kommen.
I see everyone and how they do things.	Ik sjoch elkenien en hoe't se dingen dogge.
I know you love him and he loves you	Ik wit dat jo fan him hâlde en hy fan dy hâldt
And your friends are not.	En dyn freonen binne net.
There will be time for such a word.	Der sil tiid wêze foar sa'n wurd.
It would not take much for them to come with us.	It soe net folle nedich wêze foar har om mei ús te kommen.
I never really knew why	Ik wist noait echt wêrom
How would it be.	Hoe soe it wêze.
I never know how to say this	Ik wit nea hoe te sizzen dit
And so the er.	En sa die er.
I also have a question for you	Ik haw ek in fraach foar dy
I could not speak.	Ik koe net prate.
He just said, stop.	Hy sei krekt, hâld op.
I had another job to do	Ik hie in oare baan te dwaan
I can not wait to go to bed	Ik kin net wachtsje om op bêd te gean
I found this, but it does not work.	Ik haw dizze fûn, mar it wurket net.
Of course he can not do this.	Dit kin er fansels net.
They should not be there.	Se moatte der net wêze.
They really would.	Se soene echt.
That is for them to care.	Dat is foar har om te jaan.
We are happy and my family is doing well.	Wy binne bliid en myn famylje docht it goed.
And make it he has.	En meitsje it hy hat.
But now you have to make it right.	Mar no moatte jo it goed meitsje.
I was not alone in here	Ik wie hjir net allinnich yn
I do not regret it	It spyt my der net om
I never went back.	Ik gie nea werom.
This year they have.	Dit jier hawwe se.
I tried to hurt him	Ik besocht him sear te meitsjen
You could not have done it.	Jo koene it net dien hawwe.
I wanted to want them, but they never do	Ik woe se wolle, mar se dogge it noait
She went on.	Se gie troch.
We can take it.	Wy kinne it nimme.
Maybe he's not as sick as you think.	Miskien is er net sa siik as jo tinke.
I did not know how much she would believe	Ik wist net hoefolle se leauwe soe
I asked what happened to my friend.	Ik frege wat der mei myn freon bard is.
Much more than a seat and nothing else.	Folle mear as in sit en neat oars.
Many twice the size	In protte twa kear de grutte
I got it.	Ik haw it.
I was really interested	Ik wie echt ynteressearre
I think you should keep it	Ik tink dat jo it hâlde moatte
I believe she needs you something	Ik leau dat se jo wat nedich hat
We have the man.	Wy hawwe de man.
Tell me how you can do it.	Fertel my hoe't jo it kinne dwaan.
I have tried and tried	Ik haw besocht en besocht
They talk about what happened.	Se prate oer wat der bard is.
I never expected it would be easy	Ik hie noait ferwachte dat it maklik soe wêze
I just do not want to hurt you	Ik wol dy gewoan net sear sjen
It will be difficult.	It sil dreech wêze.
This does not happen often.	Dit bart net faak.
I wonder if other people are going through that too.	Ik freegje my ôf oft oare minsken dat ek troch geane.
I'll do it first thing tomorrow morning	Ik sil it moarn moarn earst dwaan
He was talking.	Hy wie oan it praten.
I think it always will	Ik tink dat it altyd sil
I can not agree with that	Dêr kin ik it net mei iens wêze
I have not seen him for days	Ik haw him al dagen net sjoen
If you try it, take it with food.	As jo ​​​​it besykje, nim it dan mei iten.
I feel happy that it's okay with him	Ik fiel my bliid dat it goed is mei him
I could come and go.	Ik koe komme en gean.
They are there now.	Se binne der no.
And the car itself.	En de auto sels.
It gave a little.	It joech in bytsje.
She did not look over.	Se seach net oer.
Not us doing.	Net ús dwaan.
He would not make any money from it.	Hy soe der gjin jild oan meitsje.
But for me, it keeps me alive.	Mar foar my hâldt it my yn libben.
I was still waiting for something.	Ik wachte noch wat.
I need to go there and talk to her.	Ik moat der hinne en mei har prate.
A lot had started here.	In protte wie hjir begûn.
I thought of him too	Ik tocht oan him ek
Do not worry if you have.	Sit gjin soargen as jo hawwe.
I was not there to help	Ik wie der net om te helpen
Then the only question is this.	Dan is de ienige fraach dit.
Now we ask this back.	No freegje wy dit werom.
I'll just leave it at that.	Dêr lit ik it mar by.
All he wants to do is win, and he wants to play.	Alles wat er dwaan wol is winne, en hy wol spylje.
I had nothing to do with it	Ik hie der neat oan
They make money.	Se meitsje jild.
I'm glad it was wrong.	Ik bin bliid dat it ferkeard wie.
That I can not say about many people	Dat kin ik net sizze oer in protte minsken
We need to stay and take care of them.	Wy moatte bliuwe en soargje foar har.
I know it could not have been you	Ik wit dat it jo net west hawwe koe
She may have had parents.	Se hie miskien âlden.
You have to help them.	Jo moatte har helpe.
But not the one who does it.	Mar net dejinge dy't der ta docht.
Let your child be a child.	Lit jo bern in bern wêze.
I do not believe yet	Ik leau noch net
They told me.	Ha se my ferteld.
It did him no good.	It die him net goed.
I will not even ask for myself	Ik sil net iens om my freegje
That he should not have said.	Dat hie er net sizze moatten.
I needed help.	Ik moast help hawwe.
I could not be happier	Ik koe net mear bliid wêze
He will not ask until you tell him.	Hy sil net freegje oant jo it him fertelle.
That's what they get.	Dat krije se.
I need to be with my friend.	Ik moat by myn freon wêze.
Never talk about me.	Praat noait oer my.
Tomorrow I may have to come again	Moarn moat ik miskien wer komme
You knew it would.	Jo wisten wol.
Soon she felt whole again.	Al gau fielde se har wer hiel.
We are not all good, but are much better off.	Wy binne net alles goed, mar binne folle better ôf.
I can do nothing about it	Dêr kin ik neat oan dwaan
And you can not go back now.	En jo kinne no net werom.
Well, well, well !.	Wol, wol, wol!.
These are often not enough.	Dy binne faak net genôch.
It is this that makes them work.	It is dit dat makket dat se wurkje.
I was not trying to scare you	Ik besocht jo net bang te meitsjen
It would never happen.	It soe nea barre.
It was not his place to say that.	It wie net syn plak om dat te sizzen.
It had not gone bad.	It wie net min gien.
She should not even be with people.	Se soe net iens by minsken wêze moatte.
This makes me a we now.	Dit makket my no in wy.
Would love to see us get him.	Soe graach sjen dat wy him krije.
I would not want to do that	Dat soe ik net dwaan wolle
But none of those things are true.	Mar net ien fan dy dingen is wier.
I looked over her well	Ik seach har goed oer
But our work is not done.	Mar ús wurk is net dien.
That being said, it needs some work.	Dat wurdt sein, it hat wat wurk nedich.
I could see how much he loved her	Ik koe sjen hoefolle hy fan har hâlde
Things could soon go bad.	Dingen koene gau min gean.
There can be only one way.	It kin mar ien manier.
I've never said that to her in my life.	Dat haw ik yn myn libben noch noait tsjin har sein.
It would not be looked after.	Der soe net nei sjoen wurde.
In fact, this is not always true.	Eins is dat net altyd wier.
I sat on her bed.	Ik siet op har bêd.
I had seen you for days	Ik hie dy al dagen sjoen
This happens to a lot of people.	Dit bart mei in protte minsken.
I actually did not want to talk to her right now	Ik woe no eins net mei har prate
It could be that there was a party.	It kin wêze dat der in feest wie.
Either way, he would make it right.	Hoe dan ek, hy soe it goed meitsje.
And somehow we knew he knew.	En op ien of oare manier wisten wy dat hy wist.
If it were not, we would not have the word.	As it net wie, soene wy ​​it wurd net iens hawwe.
I want to know why he did not show up last night	Ik wol witte wêrom't er jûn net sjen liet
I was not happy with this	Ik wie hjir net bliid mei
I would still go to another school	Ik soe noch nei in oare skoalle
Or so it once was.	Of sa wie it eartiids.
It should not have.	It hie net moatten.
I had to think about everything	Ik moast oer alles tinke
That was never too certain.	Dêr wie noait te wis fan.
I have heard nothing of that	Dêr haw ik neat fan heard
But there are some issues with the idea.	Mar d'r binne in pear problemen mei it idee.
To be necessary.	Om nedich te wêzen.
Not much around here.	Net folle om hjir.
Do not be angry with me.	Wês net lilk op my.
You know something that can help us.	Jo witte wat dat ús kin helpe.
She had never seen him again.	Se hie him nea wer sjoen.
It has happened twice.	It is twa kear bard.
I can not believe any of this is happening	Ik kin net leauwe dat ien fan dit bart
They also speak at this time.	Se prate ek yn dizze tiid.
I have to show this to everyone	Ik moat dit oan elkenien sjen litte
I liked that in a man	Ik mocht dat yn in man
Nice enough city.	Moai genôch stêd.
They're still talking about him.	Se prate der noch oer him.
We have waited a long time.	Wy hawwe lang wachte.
I had to see him again this weekend	Ik moast him dit wykein wer sjen
I still live at home with my mother	Ik wenje noch thús by myn mem
I could see that my plan would not happen	Ik koe sjen dat myn plan net barre soe
They were unlike anyone he had seen before.	Se wiene oars as elkenien dy't hy earder sjoen hie.
See also better.	Sjoch ek better.
I did not know you like this kind of thing	Ik wist net dat jo dit soarte ding leuk fine
Wake up wake up wake up.	Wekker wurde wekker wurde wekker.
Think about where they might come from.	Tink troch wêr't se miskien komme út.
We've done a bad job of it.	Wy hawwe der in min wurk fan makke.
I could have life, but he could not have hair	Ik koe it libben hawwe, mar hy koe gjin hier
I feel better though	Ik fiel my wol better
There was nothing that anyone could do.	Der wie neat dat immen dwaan koe.
I need to know his name	Ik moat syn namme witte
I had never been before	Ik hie nea west earder
There are not so many of them.	D'r binne net safolle fan har.
I know someone who knows this person.	Ik ken ien dy't dizze persoan ken.
That was all he said.	Dat wie alles wat er sei.
But there is nothing else to do.	Mar der is neat oars te dwaan.
I could not even get that right	Dat koe ik net iens goed krije
But you have to be careful.	Mar jo moatte foarsichtich wêze.
And he waited.	En hy wachte.
I want to leave that morning	Ik wol dy moarn fuort
That made her wonder how much this guy knew.	Dat makke har ôf hoefolle dizze keardel wist.
I had not looked at him like that	Ik hie net sa nei him sjoen
Let us help !.	Lit ús helpe!.
That's what I'll give her.	Dat sil ik har jaan.
It was never about the money.	It gie nea oer it jild.
Don’t be afraid to take your time with things.	Wês net bang om jo tiid te nimmen mei dingen.
I can not hurt him so much	Ik kin him net sa sear dwaan
She was so free, so happy.	Se wie sa frij, sa bliid.
I'll be what you need	Ik sil wêze wat jo nedich hawwe
So it went from year to year.	Sa gie it fan jier nei jier.
I did what he wanted when he wanted	Ik die wat er woe, doe't er woe
It does not matter who your father is or where you come from.	It makket net út wa't jo heit is of wêr't jo wei komme.
We do not think so.	Wy tinke der net sa oan.
This was not my best.	Dit wie net myn bêste.
He's been here ever since.	Hy is hjir sûnt dy tiid.
I was not sure how to tell	Ik wie net wis hoe te fertellen
It's time.	It wurd tiid.
We have to try it.	Wy moatte it besykje.
A few years ago, everything was beautiful	In pear jier lyn wie alles moai
It took his father too.	It naam syn heit ek.
It was so good to see him again.	It wie sa goed om him wer te sjen.
I did the same thing	Ik die itselde ding
So we decided on the same thing.	Dat wy besletten ta itselde ding.
There was nothing of that.	Dêr wie neat fan.
They do not.	Dat dogge se net.
I think she was surprised	Ik tink dat se ferrast wie
She had not come for the money.	Se wie net kommen foar it jild.
We got a new one.	Wy krigen in nije.
I was not really surprised	Ik wie net echt ferrast
I had been very good at that once.	Dêr hie ik in kear tige goed yn west.
I think it was a long time ago	Ik tink dat it lang lyn wie
So was everyone.	Sa wie elkenien.
Just go through and through.	Gean gewoan troch en troch.
I did not want everyone to see me that way	Ik woe net dat elkenien my sa seach
He had no idea how long.	Hy hie gjin idee hoe lang.
I also walked to work.	Ik rûn ek nei it wurk.
I saw him before he left	Ik seach him foardat hy gie
I kept going for him	Ik bleau foar him gean
You're ready to stay with me for a day or two.	Jo komme ree om in dei as twa by my te bliuwen.
I did not even know where he lived	Ik wist net iens wêr't er wenne
They know where you are.	Se witte wêr't jo binne.
I had to get away from you	Ik moast fan dy ôf
She did not look back.	Se seach net werom.
Maybe that's just as good.	Miskien is dat like goed.
You know what he wanted.	Jo witte wat hy woe.
Never had a chance.	Nea hie gjin kâns.
He will not come.	Hy sil net komme.
He knew how to read them.	Hy wist se te lêzen.
This is where things have become very clear to me.	Dit is wêr't dingen my hiel dúdlik wurden binne.
Come on, it's going to be fun.	Kom op, it wurdt leuk.
This will hurt.	Dit sil sear dwaan.
I want him in me	Ik wol him yn my ha
What he will.	Wat hy sil.
I wish this was our house, but it is not	Ik woe dat dit ús hûs wie, mar it is it net
He thought she might have something to do with the work.	Hy tocht dat se miskien wat oan it wurk hie.
As much as we want.	Safolle as wy wolle.
That's what I need to see.	Dat moat ik sjen.
I think you should stay here	Ik tink dat jo hjir bliuwe moatte
That would have been too easy.	Dat soe te maklik west hawwe.
We can do it.	Wy kinne it dwaan.
Busy, busy, busy.	Drok, drok, drok.
He looked so good	Hy seach der sa goed út
I think there are a few things	Ik tink dat d'r in pear dingen binne
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Miskien in bytsje, miskien in protte.
He has them.	Hy hat se.
I can get you another one	Ik kin dy noch ien krije
The other two could be anyone, I think.	De oare twa kinne elkenien wêze, tink ik.
You will be found out.	Jo sille wurde fûn út.
It made me believe in film	It liet my leauwe yn film
I felt it too.	Ik fielde it ek.
I found she was not	Ik fûn dat se net wie
I do not believe we will ever be.	Ik leau net dat wy oait sille wêze.
I have not seen her for a few days	Ik haw har in pear dagen net sjoen
I could not even see it.	Ik koe it net iens sjen.
We do not even stop.	Wy hâlde net iens op.
I should never have taken them	Ik hie se nea nimme moatten
I told you all about her	Ik fertelde dy alles oer har
Not many people knew that.	Net in protte minsken wisten dat.
We did it too.	Wy diene it ek.
I just did not tell him	Ik haw it him gewoan net ferteld
I have no days.	Ik haw gjin dagen.
I know where to find it	Ik wit wêr't it te finen is
I know the place.	Ik ken it plak.
I did not like any of it	Ik mocht der neat fan
She looked at me.	Se seach nei my.
I have no idea what's going to happen	Ik ha gjin idee fan wat der komme sil
So are you.	Dat binne jo ek.
He said he was not.	Hy sei dat hy net wie.
We do, he's gone.	Dat dogge wy, hy is fuort.
I see you do it every day	Ik sjoch dat jo it alle dagen dogge
I think she can make it this time	Ik tink dat se it dizze kear kin meitsje
But nothing seems to help.	Mar neat liket te helpen.
I would never do that.	Dat soe ik noait dwaan.
I really hope you are fine	Ik hoopje echt dat jo goed binne
You would not even think it was on.	Jo soene net iens tinke dat it oan wie.
I almost ran into her	Ik rûn har hast tsjin
I was not sure where.	Ik wie net wis wêr.
I'm glad they did not	Ik bin bliid dat se it net diene
We still have a problem getting into the house.	Wy hawwe noch in probleem om yn 'e hûs te kommen.
We love both.	Wy hâlde fan beide.
She knew it was coming.	Se wist dat dit komme soe.
I can not keep her	Ik kin har net hâlde litte
I want to tell him more.	Ik wol him mear sizze.
The time has come to leave.	De tiid is kommen om fuort te gean.
Do not look at me like that.	Sjoch my net sa oan.
But you do not have to worry.	Mar jo hoege jo gjin soargen te meitsjen.
Or maybe he had children.	Of miskien hie er bern.
He must keep us happy.	Hy moat ús bliid hâlde.
I could not believe what was happening	Ik koe net leauwe wat der bart
So often.	Sa faak.
I did not want him to try to get me back	Ik woe net dat hy besocht my werom te krijen
I can not leave him with her	Ik kin him net by har litte
I can do nothing myself	Ik kin sels neat
I just did not know yet how to think about it	Ik wist gewoan noch net hoe't ik der oan tinke moast
You probably know that too.	Dat witte jo wierskynlik ek.
And all that time they had not told her.	En al dy tiid hiene se it har net ferteld.
He said he was not.	Hy sei dat hy net wie.
I will take the good with the bad.	Ik sil it goede mei it minne nimme.
Let's talk about something else.	Litte wy it oer wat oars hawwe.
What is not is what I want.	Wat net is wat ik wol.
I have no problem with that	Dêr haw ik gjin probleem mei
They knew it would not help.	Se wisten dat it net helpe soe.
I wonder what he will do about it	Ik freegje my ôf wat er der oan dwaan sil
I had hoped she would	Ik hie hope dat se soe
I can not, and will not take it anymore	Ik kin it net, en sil it net mear nimme
With two days to go, we really need your help.	Mei twa dagen te gean, hawwe wy jo help echt nedich.
I hope you are doing well	ik hoopje dat it goed mei dy giet
They are not happy about that.	Dêr wurde se net bliid mei.
I found them together on bed	Ik fûn se tegearre op bêd
That's exactly what's happening.	Dat is krekt wat bart.
I went where she went	Ik gie wêr't se gie
I think it's getting even better.	Ik tink dat it noch better wurdt.
He will help us.	Hy sil ús helpe.
For you it is different.	Foar jo is it oars.
I know we can work it out.	Ik wit dat wy it wurkje kinne.
And not just to be late.	En net allinnich om let te wêzen.
His car was not found.	Syn auto wie net fûn.
I had no idea what was going on	Ik hie gjin idee wat der oan de hân wie
You speak clearly and well.	Jo prate dúdlik en goed.
I'm just telling you what she's telling me.	Ik fertel dy gewoan wat se my fertelle.
I will never love another woman	Ik sil noait fan in oare frou hâlde
I did not have to think	Ik moast net tinke
Her work was done.	Har wurk wie dien.
I never thought that would happen	Ik hie noait tocht dat dat barre soe
They are not children.	It binne gjin bern.
I have to tell you something against me	Ik moat dy wat tsjin my sizze
She would worry about why tomorrow.	Se soe har soargen meitsje oer it wêrom moarn.
I think it's how hard you work on them	Ik tink dat it is hoe hurd jo oan har wurkje
That's what he did.	Dat hat er dien.
I'll never be good, and that's not bad	Ik sil nea goed wêze, en dat is net min
Try it, just for a day.	Besykje it, gewoan foar in dei.
We are very careful about that.	Dêr binne wy ​​tige foarsichtich mei.
He sat up.	Hy siet op.
He did not hurt.	Hy mei net sear.
He could not speak nor think.	Hy koe net prate noch tinke.
I even saw under the bed, nothing	Ik seach sels ûnder it bêd, neat
I feel scared feeling this way	Ik fiel bang fiel dizze manier
I was happy for everything	Ik wie bliid foar alles
I will never tell it.	Ik sil it noait fertelle.
Dad was wrong.	Heit wie ferkeard.
I want to know who.	Ik wol witte wa.
I know you will take good care of me	Ik wit dat jo goed foar my soargje sille
I was wrong	Ik wie it ferkeard
But things are different.	Mar dingen binne oars.
We need this man.	Wy hawwe dizze man nedich.
I think maybe he knew	Ik tink miskien hy wist
I'll wait until it comes	Ik wachtsje oant it komt
Do not be so.	Wês net sa.
I will always be with you	Ik sil altyd by dy wêze
He saw me as a mother.	Hy seach my as mem.
This time it may be me.	Dizze kear kin it my wêze.
I also had some work to do	Ik hie ek wat wurk te dwaan
He has not seen the film yet.	Hy hat de film noch net sjoen.
I was never, am or will be any different	Ik wie noait, bin of sil oars wêze
I was looking forward to that	Dêr seach ik nei út
You can not be too careful in this job.	Jo kinne net te foarsichtich wêze yn dizze baan.
I waited until he came back	Ik wachte oant er werom kaam
Everything went so well.	Alles gie sa goed.
I will make this again	Ik sil meitsje dit wer
It happened a lot.	It barde in protte.
I had to do it myself	Ik moast it sels dwaan
I've been waiting a long time for you	Ik ha lang op dy wachte
She makes everything fun.	Se makket alles leuk.
There's so much going on.	D'r is safolle dat der yn giet.
Without looking back.	Sûnder werom te sjen.
There could have been more.	Der kin mear west hawwe.
I know things you need to know	Ik wit dingen dy't jo witte moatte
Someone has to tell him to get over himself.	Immen moat him sizze om oer himsels te kommen.
We do not ask if she will do it.	Wy freegje net oft se it sil dwaan.
I actually did not care too much about it	Ik hie der eins net al te folle oan
I still believe there is a chance.	Ik leau noch dat der in kâns is.
Many of his friends had come and gone	In protte fan syn freonen wiene kommen en gien
You are one of us.	Do bist ien fan ús.
I probably will not agree	Ik sil der wierskynlik net iens wêze
I told him it was a good idea	Ik fertelde him dat it in goed idee wie
If you find him, let me know.	As jo ​​fine him, lit my witte.
Never felt good at home, did not accept it.	Nea fielde goed thús, naam it net oan.
I still remember when it happened.	Ik wit noch doe't it barde.
That's life here.	Dat is it libben hjir.
He told me he did not know.	Hy fertelde my dat hy it net wit.
They said she had a dog.	Se seine dat se in hûn hie.
I want her out of my life	Ik wol har út myn libben
She came with every reason not to go.	Se kaam mei alle reden om net te gean.
I just did not know how to get out of there.	Ik wist gewoan net hoe ik der út moast.
It depends on what you do.	It makket út wat jo dogge.
I did not want this	Ik woe dit net
I'm totally fine	Ik bin hielendal goed
They will never, ever say.	Se sille nea nea sizze.
Go on, you know you want to.	Gean troch, jo witte dat jo wolle.
He lets you play for him.	Hy lit jo foar him spylje.
I had a nice house and did it well	Ik hie in moai hûs en die it goed
This is not what you want from your first time.	Dit is net wat jo wolle fan jo earste kear.
I'm for that too.	Dêr bin ik ek foar.
Let it talk to me about.	Lit it praten oan my oer.
It was a big city.	It wie in grutte stêd.
She had not heard from him for more than a year.	Se hie al mear as in jier neat fan him heard.
I know this is true	Ik wit dat dit wier is
I just had nothing left to worry about	Ik hie der gewoan neat mear om
I'm talking about something here	Ik praat my hjir wat op
The money was badly needed	It jild wie hurd nedich
These are very real to the people who have them.	Dizze binne heul echt foar de minsken dy't se hawwe.
I've had enough of it already.	Ik ha der al genôch fan.
They did nothing wrong.	Se diene neat ferkeard.
Always.	Altyd.
No matter how busy the day was.	Hoe drok de dei ek wie.
This in itself was not a problem.	Dit wie op himsels gjin probleem.
He does not know who he is.	Hy wit net wa't er is.
Let's go to your place.	Litte wy nei jo plak gean.
It's so fun.	It is sa leuk.
But look at everyone.	Mar sjoch elkenien.
He could do nothing to prevent it.	Hy koe neat dwaan om it foar te kommen.
I gladly told her we were not so different	Ik fertelde har bliid dat wy net sa oars wiene
I also did not know he was coming	Ik wist ek net dat er komme soe
It's not one guy.	It is net ien keardel.
Not ready yet.	Noch net klear.
I assume you are doing that now	Ik nim oan dat jo dat no dogge
And back in.	En wer yn.
But only something is.	Mar allinnich wat is.
I really could not tell	Ik koe it echt net fertelle
To see him.	Om him te sjen.
I thought it was getting too hard.	Ik tocht dat it te hurd kaam.
I'm glad you're my friend, too	Ik bin bliid dat jo binne myn freon, te
She liked to talk to him.	Se mocht graach mei him prate.
I can not do it myself	Ik kin it net sels dwaan
It seems so.	It liket wol.
You can do this easily at home.	Jo kinne dit maklik thús dwaan.
I think they are on me.	Ik tink dat se op my binne.
I just let life get in the way	Ik lit it libben gewoan yn 'e wei komme
She was different now.	Se wie no oars.
But that is not the question.	Mar dat is net de fraach.
And more and more.	En mear en mear.
I did not want to do anything with it	Ik woe der neat mei dwaan
Why he did it does not matter.	Wêrom't er it die, makket neat út.
I can still be around	Ik kin noch wêze om
He really had to deal with it.	Hy hie der echt mei te krijen.
They have no idea what they are doing.	Se hawwe gjin idee wat se dogge.
And that's fine with it.	En dêr is it goed mei.
It did many things well too.	It die in protte dingen ek goed.
I did something for you	Ik die wat foar dy
Pick up the children.	Nim de bern op.
You're the one he came to.	Jo binne dejinge dy't er nei kaam.
I had no idea how things would turn out	Ik hie gjin idee hoe't dingen wurde soe
I know something's going on	Ik wit dat der wat bart
This can be bad.	Dit kin min wêze.
Even though she did not know much to say.	Ek al wist se net sa folle te sizzen.
My dad took me to take a picture.	Myn heit naam my mei om in foto te meitsjen.
I will then ask you to say a few words	Ik sil jo dan freegje om in pear wurden te sizzen
I did not ask for anything here	Ik haw hjir neat om frege
I had to give in to that	Dêr moast ik my yn jaan
It's what makes us ours.	It is wat ús ús makket.
And he knows me.	En hy ken my.
She has none.	Se hat gjin.
I know of these things	Ik wit fan dizze dingen
Please do it soon.	Graach doch it gau.
He's coming back.	Hy komt werom.
I would not tell you	Ik soe it dy net fertelle
One more thing.	Noch ien ding.
They will take care of you.	Se sille nei dy soargje.
Weather.	Wetter.
They just made it.	Se hawwe it krekt makke.
I opened the door but did not let her in	Ik die de doar iepen, mar liet har net yn
I really wanted to love this book.	Ik woe echt fan dit boek hâlde.
I thought the same thing too	Ik tocht ek itselde
See what is not being said.	Sjoch wat der net sein wurdt.
''.	''.
I'm sick of it and sick of it.	Ik bin der siik fan en siik fan har.
I still very much hope we were.	Ik hoopje noch tige dat wy wiene.
I need someone.	Ik ha immen nedich.
Go back to him.	Gean werom nei him.
It's probably long past time you did.	It is wierskynlik lang ferline tiid dat jo dien hawwe.
And just about everything.	En gewoan alles.
I would be sorry if anything happened to her.	It soe my spyt wêze as der wat mei har bard is.
I have to try this with my next book, which is what it's all about.	Ik moat dit besykje mei myn folgjende boek, wêr't it ek oer giet.
I'm so glad you're here today.	Ik bin sa bliid dat jo hjir hjoed binne.
I can not tell you much more now	Ik kin jo no net folle mear fertelle
He had not talked much about his book.	Hy hie net folle oer syn boek praat.
Man, party some things.	Man, feest wat dingen.
I do the same things every day	Ik doch deselde dingen alle dagen
I just want you to look like me	Ik wol gewoan dat jo mei my lykje
He was never seen.	Hy waard nea sjoen.
But there was so much, so much.	Mar der wie safolle, safolle.
Then she could be her teacher.	Dan koe se har learaar wêze.
She should have known he could not let it go.	Se hie witte moatten dat er it net litte koe.
This time it was better.	Dizze kear wie it better.
And she did it, it seems.	En se hat it dien, liket it.
I looked at them and put them on carefully	Ik seach se nei en sette se foarsichtich oan
He was not always.	Hy wie net altyd.
He says he will.	Hy seit dat hy sil.
He wants to be with you.	Hy wol by jo wêze.
She said not a word.	Se sei gjin wurd.
But many questions remain.	Mar in protte fragen bliuwe.
You have done a better job.	Jo hawwe in better wurk dien.
We were too late.	Wy wiene te let.
I would not think so	Ik soe net tinke sa
The truth, and nothing but the truth.	De wierheid, en neat oars as de wierheid.
That seemed like a lot at the time.	Dat like yn dy tiid in protte.
That's what happened here.	Dat is wat hjir bard.
I can not believe this is my house	Ik kin net leauwe dat dit myn hûs is
I think that would be the best thing for everyone	Ik tink dat soe wêze it bêste ding foar elkenien
I was wrong about everything	Ik wie ferkeard oer alles
You're trying to figure out where you are.	Jo besykje út te finen wêr't jo binne.
I never asked for it	Ik haw it noait frege
The letter hit home.	De brief rekke thús.
I know exactly who he is	Ik wit krekt wa't hy is
I want him to see me again, to see me better.	Ik wol dat er my wer sjocht, my better sjocht.
They just look like it.	Se lykje gewoan.
I can actually love a woman	Ik kin eins fan in frou hâlde
I think she's happy.	Ik tink dat se bliid is.
We try it all.	Wy besykje it allegear.
I walked to the door and opened something	Ik rûn nei de doar en die wat iepen
There were not many good ones.	Der wiene net folle goede.
I look at her twice	Ik sjoch har twa kear oan
I made it just in time	Ik makke it krekt op 'e tiid
I was not ready to do it again	Ik wie net ree om it wer te dwaan
I'm not sorry.	It spyt my net.
She told her he was not home.	Se fertelde har dat hy net thús wie.
I knew you would	Ik wist dat jo soene
That says something.	Dat seit wat.
I did not even have a car yet.	Ik hie noch net iens in auto.
I wanted to see them come into the room	Ik woe se yn 'e keamer komme sjen
I really wanted this guy	Ik woe echt dizze man
I thought it would be fun	Ik tocht dat it wol leuk wêze soe
Just like her father.	Krekt as har heit.
They had reason to worry.	Se hiene reden om soargen te meitsjen.
This is fun.	Dit is leuk.
That's what he did.	Dat hat er dien.
It must be something good.	It moat wat goed wêze.
I know what we can do	Ik wit wat wy kinne dwaan
He said he was too busy.	Hy sei dat er te drok wie.
But they are there when they need them.	Mar se binne der as se se nedich binne.
He's not there either.	Hy is der ek net.
I did not know what to do with it	Ik wist net wat ik der mei oan moast
I can not wait until new week.	Ik kin net wachtsje oant nije wike.
I have not had one since.	Ik haw sûnt dy tiid net mear hân.
I did not do it for myself	Ik haw it net foar my dien
Not one is true.	Net ien is wier.
I believe that is about thirty days away	Ik leau dat dat sa'n tritich dagen fuort is
I had another question.	Ik hie in oare fraach.
I did not want to hope	Ik woe net hoopje
It did not matter to me anymore when she saw me	It makke my net mear út as se my seach
They will be back again, and again, and again.	Se sille wer werom wêze, en wer, en wer.
He would tell you what he thought.	Hy soe dy fertelle wat er tocht.
Just you, and one other person if you will.	Krekt jo, en ien oare persoan as jo wolle.
He told me to stop and he would look into it.	Hy fertelde my om ôf te hâlden en hy soe der nei sjen.
It's nice though.	It is wol aardich.
A month ago he said he did it	In moanne lyn sei hy dat hy it die
I want to know about you today	Ik wol hjoed oer dy witte
Below.	Ûnder.
Tell us why.	Fertel ús wêrom.
It should be enough	It moat genôch wêze
It's just too bad.	It is gewoan te min.
And it's a nice thing.	En it is in moai ding.
I'm not a child anymore	Ik bin gjin bern mear
He does not even know where they are.	Hy wit net iens wêr't se binne.
Don't ask about it anymore.	Freegje der net mear oer.
They never had children.	Se hiene nea bern.
I know you love me too	Ik wit dat jo ek fan my hâlde
I can not wait to read much more from you.	Ik kin net wachtsje om folle mear fan jo te lêzen.
I do not go back and forth with it	Ik gean der net hinne en wer mei
You have to work for it.	Jo moatte der foar wurkje.
We had no office.	Wy hiene gjin kantoar.
Now it seems to be here.	No liket it hjir te wêzen.
I have a lot of people who like my work.	Ik haw in protte minsken dy't myn wurk leuk fine.
Well, this is going to be fun.	No, dit wurdt wol leuk.
I realized it over and over	Ik realisearre it oer en oer
I should not.	Ik soe net moatte.
I did not have to tell her where to go	Ik hoegde har net te fertellen wêr't se hinne moast
She wants everyone to know that you can do this.	Se wol dat elkenien wit dat jo dit kinne.
At the meeting, he was angry.	Yn 'e gearkomste wie hy lilk.
I never had any children.	Ik hie noait gjin bern.
And now the same thing can happen to you.	En no kin itselde ding barre mei dy.
I have my car here	Ik haw myn auto hjir
I worry about our people	Ik meitsje my soargen oer ús minsken
More than a few this time.	Mear as in pear dizze kear.
I wondered who he was	Ik frege my ôf wa't hy wie
But enough about what it is.	Mar genôch oer wat it is.
I almost did	Dat haw ik hast dien
It's not nice here.	It is hjir net moai.
I had done this before.	Ik hie dit earder dien.
I think she's talking to me	Ik tink dat se tsjin my praat
No one is essentially nothing.	Nimmen is yn wêzen neat.
I had to get out of the house	Ik moast it hûs út
I could not look at him.	Ik koe net nei him sjen.
I should have been there.	Ik hie der wêze moatten.
I did not even have a car, and they knew it	Ik hie net iens in auto, en se wisten it
It was almost one.	It wie hast ien.
I had my chance at life	Ik hie myn kâns op it libben
I have not told anyone	Ik haw it oan gjinien ferteld
It has no reason to be afraid of the truth.	It hat gjin reden om bang te wêzen foar de wierheid.
It's not easy at work.	It is net maklik op it wurk.
I should have told you about her	Ik hie dy oer har fertelle moatten
I've ever been too	Ik haw ea ek west
I pay her to look forward to the place	Ik betelje har om út te sjen nei it plak
I realized them for myself	Ik realisearre har foar my
I might have found someone who knows me	Ik hie miskien wol ien fûn dy't my ken
I can see that the same thing happened to you	Ik kin sjen dat itselde ding mei dy bard is
Let the good people win.	Lit de goede minsken winne.
It's very interesting.	It is tige ynteressearre.
And there are other things we can do.	En d'r binne oare dingen dy't wy kinne dwaan.
I've never seen you so happy before	Ik haw dy noch noait sa bliid sjoen
It's just different.	It is gewoan oars.
She did not know what day it was.	Se wist net hokker dei it wie.
You worked for the other money you needed.	Jo wurke foar it oare jild dat jo nedich hawwe.
There's nothing you can do about it.	D'r is neat dat jo der oan kinne dwaan.
And also now.	En ek no.
You do not know how it will happen.	Jo witte net hoe't it barre sil.
He was good, but you were better.	Hy wie goed, mar jo wiene better.
So sat the dog.	Sa siet de hûn.
I think that's for sure	Ik tink dat dat wis is
And she still did this.	En se hat dit noch dien.
Well, we have one.	No, wy hawwe in.
And they will not.	En se sille net.
I'm good at it.	Ik bin der goed yn.
Or tell me what works.	Of fertel my wat wurket.
I'm probably out of time	Ik bin miskien al út de tiid
I have not heard anything about it	Ik haw der neat fan heard
I will not be the last	Ik sil net de lêste wêze
We're still there.	Wy binne der no noch oan.
The three of us can do things forever.	De trije fan ús kinne dingen foar altyd dwaan.
She worked long and hard for me.	Se wurke lang en hurd foar my.
I had the same problems that everyone has	Ik hie deselde problemen dy't elkenien hat
But it's what it is	Mar it is wat it is
He never seems to get tired.	Hy liket noait wurch te wurden.
It probably will too.	It sil wierskynlik ek.
You are ready to take questions.	Jo binne ree om fragen te nimmen.
Maybe that would see her through here, maybe not.	Miskien soe dat har hjir troch sjen, miskien net.
I really felt out of place	Ik fielde my echt út syn plak
It found out.	It fûn út.
I hope she never comes back	Ik hoopje dat se noait werom komt
I was expecting nothing else!	Ik hie neat oars ferwachte!
A photo is a photo of something	In foto is in foto fan wat
I think you should do it for tonight.	Ik tink dat jo it dwaan moatte foar fannacht.
But there are things that need to be said.	Mar d'r binne dingen dy't sein wurde moatte.
But really nothing more.	Mar eins neat mear.
It was too easy for him to get to me.	It wie te maklik foar him om by my te kommen.
I do not know many people.	Ik ken net folle minsken.
A book people have to buy.	In boek moatte minsken keapje.
Not sure if that is still the case.	Net wis oft dat noch sa is.
I don't want it.	Ik wol it net.
We can make that happen.	Wy kinne dat barre.
I do nothing else.	Ik doch neat oars.
I want us to be friends	Ik wol graach dat wy freonen binne
We need a new city.	Wy hawwe in nije stêd nedich.
You can tell me.	Jo kinne it my fertelle.
So it was, sure enough.	Sa wie it, wis genôch.
I have never felt this way for anyone else	Ik haw nea fielde dizze manier foar immen oars
As if there is no tomorrow.	As is der gjin moarn.
I would like a lot of kids	Ik soe graach in protte bern
You have to say something about it.	Jo moatte der wat oer sizze.
I wish you and your mother the best	Ik winskje dy en dyn mem it bêste ta
I assume she knows what she's dealing with	Ik nim oan dat se wit wêr't se mei te meitsjen hat
We knew it was here.	Wy wisten dat it hjir wie.
They never talk.	Se prate noait.
He was out of the house, and they did not get him.	Hy wie út 'e hûs, en se krigen him net.
I need that now.	Dat haw ik no nedich.
He must give his name.	Hy moat syn namme jaan.
She could do nothing.	Se koe neat dwaan.
I wanted her to see my family and home	Ik woe dat se myn famylje en hûs seach
Someone has to go home first.	Immen moat earst nei hûs.
I wondered if she did the same thing	Ik frege my ôf oft se itselde ding die
We will be happy to help.	Wy sille graach helpe.
I wanted to know what it was like	Ik woe witte hoe't it wie
I can see nothing but	Ik kin neat oars as sjen
In other words, at home.	Mei oare wurden, thús.
I could tell you it came a long time ago	Ik koe jo fertelle dat it lang lyn kaam
I had to talk to him something	Ik moast wat mei him prate
You can get a job here.	Jo kinne hjir in baan krije.
I do not need this thing	Ik haw dit ding net nedich
He did what he had to do.	Hy die wat er dwaan moast.
I do not want.	Ik wol net.
One day he left and never came back	Op in dei gie er fuort en kaam nea werom
She said it again.	Se sei it wer.
I only need a few days	Ik haw mar in pear dagen nedich
Next week more.	Folgjende wike mear.
You obviously did not find.	Jo hawwe fansels net fûn.
They still do.	Se dogge it noch.
It's too late.	It is te let.
All those things were true.	Al dy dingen wiene wier.
I'm not letting those two go	Ik lit dy twa net gean
I hope it was all	Ik hope dat it alles wie
I still remember going to school	Ik wit noch dat ik nei skoalle gie
She knew today would be different.	Se wist dat hjoed oars soe wêze.
I asked him if he was a father	Ik frege him oft er in heit wie
I've made this before.	Ik haw makke dit foar.
You know the truth.	Jo witte de wierheid.
I did not know how long we did that	Ik wist net hoe lang wy dat diene
I do everything and work hard when there is work.	Ik doch alles en wurkje hurd as der wurk is.
The whole city will be different.	De hiele stêd sil oars wêze.
We all go.	Wy geane allegear.
I asked her in.	Ik frege har yn.
But never in bed.	Mar nea op bêd.
I can not pay that time	Ik kin dy tiid net betelje
But she says nothing.	Mar se seit neat.
I show people who they really are	Ik lit minsken sjen wa't se echt binne
As people of them, they think they have forever.	As minsken fan har, tinke se dat se foar altyd hawwe.
There will be something.	Der sil wat wêze.
I wanted them to take you	Ik woe dat se dy nimme
We are so much more now.	Wy binne no safolle mear.
He's my best friend.	Hy is myn bêste freon.
I need to get him back here	Ik moat him hjir werom krije
I always wondered what that was	Ik frege my altyd ôf wat dat wie
I had to be careful though	Ik moast wol foarsichtich wêze
I'm just a.	Ik bin gewoan in.
I could not see where the problem came from	Ik koe net sjen wêr't it probleem wei kaam
I thought you would be free.	Ik tocht dat jo frij wêze soene.
The tour is about people.	De tocht giet oer minsken.
I stayed away from people	Ik bleau by minsken wei
I know it as well as anyone.	Ik wit it like goed as elkenien.
I've already tried	Ik haw al besocht
And then you want more.	En dan wolle jo mear.
I think she was worried	Ik tink dat se soargen wie
It was like being a child again.	It wie as wer in bern.
I wanted my mind off of things	Ik woe myn gedachten ôf fan dingen
It was her father.	It wie har heit.
That's just me.	Dat bin ik gewoan.
I could show you if you want	Ik koe dy sjen litte as jo wolle
And it has not worked.	En it is net wurke.
I know he still loves me	Ik wit wol dat hy noch fan my hâldt
Of course you did.	Fansels hawwe jo dien.
I would hope he would not but who knows	Ik soe hoopje dat er net soe mar wa wit
The party was of course still on.	It feest wie fansels noch oan.
I can not see the girl clearly	Ik kin it famke net dúdlik sjen
And there's nothing left.	En der is neat oer.
I could not believe it	Ik koe it net leauwe
She would not like what she saw there.	Se soe net leuk fine wat se dêr seach.
I will not hurt you	Ik sil dy net sear dwaan
I just thought you might want to know	Ik tocht krekt dat jo it witte wolle
They always keep their word.	Se hâlde altyd har wurd.
Not much more than that.	Net folle mear as dat.
I'm not angry at you	Ik bin net lilk op dy
They set me free to do something else as well.	Se meitsje my frij om ek wat oars te dwaan.
He never even joined.	Hy kaam sels noait by.
I had become such a person	Ik wie sa'n persoan wurden
Mom still loves it.	Mem hâldt der noch fan.
I handed her to him and ran	Ik joech har oan him en rûn
I want to do this work.	Ik wol dit wurk dwaan.
I can not go back to my family	Ik kin net werom nei myn famylje
Three, two, one.	Trije, twa, ien.
What is true, you can.	Wat wier is, kinne jo.
I had nothing against the girl	Ik hie neat tsjin it famke
From today, he would like everything to be different.	Fan hjoed ôf soe er graach wolle dat alles oars wie.
Okay, but just.	Goed, mar gewoan.
Tell me they're here.	Fertel my dat se hjir binne.
Place was pretty nice.	Plak wie moai moai.
They can never find me here.	Se kinne my hjir nea fine.
I will always be happy to help you	Ik sil altyd bliid wêze om jo te helpen
Of course she knew it.	Fansels wist se it.
It was not just me either.	It wie ek net allinnich ik.
The woman needs a man.	De frou hat in man nedich.
I almost came to your house	Ik ha my hast by dy thús kommen
I was just a kid.	Ik wie mar in bern.
The reason is clear.	De reden is dúdlik.
I knew that now	Dat wist ik no
My old man is on his way out.	Myn âld man is op wei út.
It was ready.	It wie klear.
So did I.	Dat die ik ek.
I just wanted to look at her.	Ik woe allinnich mar nei har sjen.
I will do everything.	Ik sil alles dwaan.
Tell us something.	Fertel ús wat.
I really like this idea.	Ik hâld echt fan dit idee.
It's much better than nothing.	It is folle better as neat.
I could not say where he came from	Ik koe net sizze wêr't er wei kaam
I knew your mother in those days.	Ik koe dyn mem yn dy dagen.
Of course it was.	Fansels wie it wol.
I thought about that for a long time	Dêr tocht ik al lang oan
I was sure of that	Dêr wie ik wis fan
Let's keep it that way.	Lit ús it sa hâlde.
I can not go back to jail, man	Ik kin net werom nei de finzenis, man
Neither could ever go home.	Gjin fan beide koe oait nei hûs.
It just didn’t feel right.	It fielde gewoan net goed.
Tell me a little bit about it.	Fertel my dêr in bytsje oer.
I had no job at all	Ik hie hielendal gjin wurk
I know what he's up to	Ik wit wat hy fan plan is
He was happy with that.	Dêr wie er bliid mei.
I just got up and gave it away.	Ik krekt op en joech it fuort.
But not for very long.	Mar net foar hiel lang.
He told me not to talk.	Hy fertelde my net te praten.
They love each other very much.	Se hâlde hiel fan elkoar.
Where is he ?.	Wêr is hy?.
I just wasn't that person.	Ik wie gewoan net dy persoan.
I know what's in front of me.	Ik wit wat der foar my stiet.
He came out of the house.	Hy kaam út 'e hûs.
It seems to be the same.	It liket itselde te wêzen.
You want to be able to say that you did it.	Jo wolle sizze kinne dat jo it dien hawwe.
I wanted more than that	Ik woe mear as dat
I have only done this once.	Dat haw ik mar ien kear dien.
I should have told him	Ik hie it him sizze moatten
I never heard from her again	Ik hearde noait wat mear fan har
I did not expect it	Ik hie it net ferwachte
I would not do it, whatever	Ik soe it net dwaan, wat dan ek
The couple had no children	It pear hie gjin bern
That makes me up.	Dat makket my op.
And this is our chance.	En dit is ús kâns.
I love reading about how much they love me	Ik hâld fan lêzen oer hoefolle se fan my hâlde
She would not believe it, but he did.	Se sil it net leauwe, mar hy die.
No one would do that here.	Nimmen soe dat hjir dwaan.
I think everyone has it, they can not	Ik tink dat elkenien it hat, dat kin it net
She wanted him, and she got him.	Se woe him, en se krige him.
And she's it fast.	En se is it gau.
I'll help you see it through.	Ik sil jo helpe om it troch te sjen.
We can say what we want.	Wy kinne sizze wat wy wolle.
He had not let her go yet.	Hy liet har noch net gean.
I think we should talk about	Ik tink dat wy moatte prate oer
Take it back.	Nim it werom.
I did not have to worry.	Ik hie gjin soargen hoege te hawwen.
We did not ask them here.	Wy hawwe se hjir net frege.
I have to try to help him, somehow.	Ik moat besykje him te helpen, op ien of oare manier.
The place of time.	It plak fan 'e tiid.
But now he knew the truth.	Mar no wist er de wierheid.
And they were not.	En dat wiene se net.
I should not have to tell about it	Ik soe der net oer fertelle moatte
No one had told her.	Nimmen hie it har ferteld.
I could totally live in this room	Ik koe hielendal yn dizze keamer wenje
I'm here to help you.	Ik bin hjir om jo te helpen.
No one seemed to be in the house.	Gjinien like yn 'e hûs te wêzen.
Now it was late in the day.	No wie it let op de dei.
Could not get into it.	Koe der net yn komme.
She had no mother.	Se hie gjin mem.
I love her very much	Ik hâld heul foar har
It will not.	It sil net.
We're better than that.	Wy binne better as dat.
I will stay one year	Ik sil ien jier bliuwe
I think of my family	Ik tink oan myn famylje
I asked him who he was talking about.	Ik frege him oer wa't er it hie.
This concerns me.	Dit giet my oan.
And make it yourself or let someone do it for you.	En meitsje it sels of lit immen it foar jo dwaan.
I entered the room, gave her my name and took my seat.	Ik kaam de keamer yn, joech har myn namme en naam myn sit.
She knew what was happening.	Se wist wat der barde.
I had this friend.	Ik hie dizze freon.
I have no parents.	Ik haw gjin âlden.
Or he may have both.	Of hy kin beide hawwe.
Or it can not.	Of it kin net.
He wants to talk to you about it.	Hy wol der mei dy oer prate.
He never said a word.	Hy sei noait in wurd.
We seem to be doing well.	Wy lykje it goed te dwaan.
I did not know her plan	Ik koe har plan net
That's what we could have here.	Dat koene wy ​​hjir wol hawwe.
I know it's hard	Ik wit dat it dreech is
There we are happy with very bad.	Dêr binne wy ​​bliid mei hiel min.
I still did not see who did it	Ik seach noch net wa't it die
I knew he was one of us	Ik wist dat hy ien fan ús wie
I assume that was too clear	Ik nim oan dat dat te dúdlik wie
But we have what we have.	Mar wy hawwe wat wy hawwe.
I had not even thought of that	Dêr hie ik net iens oan tocht
I really looked at him for the first time	Ik seach echt foar it earst nei him
Otherwise it was not.	Oars wie it net.
It started well.	It begûn goed.
That's us then.	Dat binne wy ​​dan.
I need you to know that.	Ik moat dy witte dat.
I could not let him go	Ik koe him net litte litte
It was late when he woke up.	It wie let doe't er wekker waard.
I was not allowed to see him	Ik mocht him net sjen
But it's more than that, or just different.	Mar it is mear as dat, of gewoan oars.
But that problem is not for us.	Mar dat probleem is net foar ús.
I saw right away that he was angry	Ik seach fuort dat er lilk wie
I can wait now.	Ik kin no wachtsje.
I could even tell my parents	Ik koe sels myn âlden fertelle
I want it done well.	Ik wol dat it goed dien wurdt.
Maybe she looked up to the same month.	Miskien seach se op nei deselde moanne.
I would say it's so good.	Ik soe sizze dat it sa goed is.
I have food and place for you	Ik haw iten en plak foar dy
She looks away.	Se sjocht fuort.
I should be enough for you	Ik soe genôch wêze moatte foar dy
I have to work tonight	Ik moat fannacht wurkje
Then another person.	Dan in oare persoan.
I think she's fine	Ik tink dat se goed komt
I had to find a way back	Ik moast in wei werom fine
I never look back	Ik sjoch der noait op werom
I have no other family at all.	Ik haw hielendal gjin oare famylje.
They have it ready.	Se hawwe it klear.
Does his job and more.	Docht syn wurk en mear.
I will not say it to everyone	Ik sil it net tsjin elkenien sizze
I want my money from you too	Ik wol dat myn jild ek fan jo is
My car arrived just that day.	Myn auto kaam krekt op dy dei.
That has yet to happen this year.	Dat moat dit jier noch barre.
You must be free.	Jo moatte frij wêze.
I was.	Ik wie.
I tell her everything	Ik fertel har alles
I would always love her	Ik soe altyd fan har hâlde
It was only a day out.	It wie mar in dei út.
But he did not know it.	Mar hy wist it net.
Nothing was done.	Der waard neat dien.
That lasts a lifetime.	Dat hâldt in libben troch.
There is nothing else.	D'r is neat oars.
He could not be here.	Hy koe hjir net wêze.
That they knew.	Dat wisten se.
That was fine with him.	Dat wie goed mei him.
But today and today only.	Mar hjoed en hjoed allinnich.
I really think you will	Ik tink echt dat jo sille
They could not find the way.	Se koene de wei net.
Time was running out and there was so much to do.	De tiid rûn út en der wie safolle te dwaan.
I was afraid to go back to class	Ik wie bang om werom te gean nei de klasse
And this was true.	En dit wie wier.
I stayed with him	Ik bleau by him op
I could only show him	Ik koe him mar sjen litte
Then she could no longer tell him.	Dan koe se it him net mear fertelle.
I could visit with my family	Ik koe besykje mei myn famylje
But there was no one in it.	Mar der wie gjinien yn.
I was happy with it.	Ik wie der bliid mei.
I try to do my best	Ik besykje it bêste te dwaan
We talked.	Wy hawwe praat.
I did not want to know him, ever	Ik woe him net witte, noait
If she was not there, he had a problem.	As se der net wie, hie er in probleem.
But there is also something else.	Mar der is ek wat oars.
We need a plan to get them out.	Wy hawwe in plan nedich om se út te krijen.
I never had that against him	Dat hie ik him noait tsjin
But everything was up to it.	Mar alles wie der oan.
I left him alone to read	Ik liet him allinnich om te lêzen
I think it's very, very likely.	Ik tink dat it heul, heul wierskynlik is.
And we are both very happy.	En wy binne beide tige bliid.
I could see it all clearly, now	Ik koe it allegear dúdlik sjen, no
Many of our friends are out of work	In protte fan ús freonen binne sûnder wurk
It's not wrong.	It is net ferkeard.
We are happy to help you.	Wy helpe jo graach.
I can not tell much about it	Ik kin der net folle oer fertelle
If you want to stay here.	As jo ​​wolle bliuwe hjir.
I want her to be my wife	Ik wol dat se myn frou is
The car.	De auto.
A bit of everything and anything	In bytsje fan alles en noch wat
But she knew it herself.	Mar se wist it sels.
Neither did my husband.	Myn man ek net.
I've been back too long now	Ik bin no te lang werom west
You can find them better.	Jo kinne har better fine.
Let them know what's going on.	Lit se witte wat der bart.
I want to help you get there.	Ik wol jo helpe om dêr te kommen.
But that was not the case.	Mar sa wie it net.
That's what I told him.	Dat haw ik him sein.
I was happy to say nothing	Ik wie bliid om neat te sizzen
I would love to see it.	Ik soe it graach sjen.
That's good, very good.	Dat is goed, hiel goed.
I will not be in the office here tomorrow.	Ik sil hjir moarn net op kantoar wêze.
I was happy with that	Dêr wie ik bliid mei
His things were obviously gone.	Syn dingen wiene fansels fuort.
That would be something.	Dat soe wat wêze.
But something else just happened.	Mar der is krekt wat oars bard.
You need to have a few.	Jo moatte in pear hawwe.
It would never be necessary.	It soe nea nedich wêze.
Far too much for me to keep.	Folle te folle foar my om te hâlden.
I did.	Dat die ik.
I did not want to talk anymore	Ik woe net mear prate
I knew someone was coming	Ik wist dat der ien komme soe
Got nothing there.	Hat dêr neat krigen.
I could only hope it was all for nothing	Ik koe mar hoopje dat it allegear foar neat wie
It was like an animal.	It wie as in bist.
It was just gone.	It wie gewoan fuort.
Her husband can no longer bear it and left.	Har man kin it net mear en gie fuort.
I just could not stand him at home	Ik koe him thús gewoan net oan
I need you to help me	Ik haw jo nedich om my te helpen
That in itself was fun though.	Dat wie op himsels wol leuk.
I tried not to look.	Ik besocht net te sjen.
Let's see.	Litte wy sjen.
I know how to find him.	Ik wit him te finen.
It never happened.	It is noait bard.
I had nothing on me.	Ik hie neat oan my.
I can not talk about it now	Ik kin der no net oer prate
I'll be here with you.	Ik sil hjir by dy wêze.
I really did not know what to say to him	Ik wist echt net wat ik tsjin him sizze moast
Just the thing.	Krekt it ding.
I wanted to make sure it was okay	Ik woe der wis fan wêze dat it goed wie
I still remember seeing it last year.	Ik wit noch dat ik ferline jier seach.
I would not have it any other way.	Ik soe it net oars ha.
I'm ready to take it all	Ik bin ree om it allegear te nimmen
We were at school together.	Wy wiene tegearre op skoalle.
I can handle him.	Ik kin him oan.
I was so happy.	Ik wie sa bliid.
It's not difficult at all.	It is hielendal net dreech.
Next thing is.	Folgjende ding is.
He put me in.	Hy sette my yn.
Maybe they should just let things go.	Miskien moatte se de dingen gewoan litte.
Of course you take one out of there.	Fansels nimme jo der ien út.
You like it too much.	Jo hâlde der te folle fan.
What is.	Wat is.
He was a man.	Hy wie in man.
I can not stand this now	Ik kin dit no net oan
The name of the movie is not certain to me.	De namme fan 'e film is my net wis.
There have been a few.	Der hawwe in pear west.
If the children are happy, then we are happy.	As de bern bliid binne, dan binne wy ​​bliid.
Are you sure you knew who he was?	Binne jo wis dat jo wisten wa't hy wie.
Really, really fun.	Echt, echt leuk.
No, she said.	Nea, sei se.
I could not, but that was his problem, not mine	Ik koe net, mar dat wie syn probleem, net myn
We needed it back.	Wy hiene it werom nedich.
But we'll see.	Mar wy sille sjen.
I obviously wanted to.	Ik woe fansels wol.
I hope you can handle that	Ik hoopje dat jo dat oan kinne
Or she knew something about him.	Of se wist wat oer him.
Probably with food.	Wierskynlik mei iten.
They would do it in the name of everything.	Se soene it dwaan yn 'e namme fan alles.
I will do all these things	Ik sil al dizze dingen dwaan
It's not gone, but better.	It is net fuort, mar better.
I really like her.	Ik wol har echt leuk fine.
I hope you would come today.	Ik hope dat jo hjoed komme soene.
I did not think she had it in her	Ik tocht net dat se it yn har hie
I should have been with you	Ik hie by dy wêze moatten
I would take your class.	Ik soe dyn klasse nimme.
I do not know why that did not happen.	Ik wit net wêrom dat net bard is.
I have friends and family at home	Ik haw freonen en famylje thús
That's of course.	Dat die se fansels.
I wanted to talk to you before the police did that	Ik woe mei dy prate foardat de plysje dat die
People knew them.	Minsken koene se.
I almost wish there were	Ik woe hast dat der wiene
I'm three hours late for work	Ik bin trije oeren te let foar wurk
He was at home.	Hy wie thús.
They were for real.	Se wiene foar echt.
Here's how you can help.	Hjir is hoe't jo kinne helpe.
It just did not look right.	It like gewoan net goed.
What better way.	Wat bettere manier.
Nothing, of course.	Neat, fansels.
The photo shows him in his car.	De foto lit him sjen yn syn auto.
If you can find one.	As jo ​​​​ien kinne fine.
He was a person.	Hy wie in persoan.
You do not really need me.	Jo hawwe my net echt nedich.
I knew she had to be there	Ik wist dat se der wêze moast
To think.	Tinke.
I always knew exactly where he was	Ik haw altyd krekt wist wêr't hy wie
I need more help and you can help me	Ik haw mear help nedich en jo kinne my helpe
I really think she should talk to someone	Ik tink echt dat se mei immen prate moat
That's what I told her.	Dat sei ik har.
I still can not believe they just let us go	Ik kin noch altyd net leauwe dat se ús gewoan litte litte
You are not what you believe.	Jo binne net wat jo leauwe.
And they happened to me too.	En se binne my ek bard.
I know what they are	Ik wit wat se binne
I hope she knew how much everyone here loved her	Ik hope dat se wist hoefolle elkenien hjir fan har hâlde
She was there for a few days.	Se wie der in pear dagen.
I did, that is, we did what was necessary	Ik die, dat is, wy diene wat nedich wie
He says what belongs to him is mine.	Hy seit wat fan syn is, is myn.
I need to talk to him	Ik moat mei him prate
I did not even have to say it	Ik hoegde it net iens te sizzen
I had to pay him for her	Ik moast him foar har betelje
I do not need her to speak back against me.	Ik haw har net nedich om tsjin my werom te praten.
I can do this, he thought	Ik kin dit wol, tocht er
I talked to her a few hours ago.	Ik praat mei har in pear oeren lyn.
I walked to the door	Ik rûn nei de doar
I would love to have it.	Ik wol it graach hawwe.
Neither do you.	Jo ek net.
I gave it to my mother.	Ik joech it oan myn mem.
She never came back.	Se kaam nea werom.
I saw it all happen last year	Ik seach it hiele ferline jier barre
I just found it this morning	Ik fûn it fan 'e moarn krekt
So she left and never came back.	Sa gie se fuort en kaam nea werom.
I never saw him without it	Ik seach him noait sûnder
You know they will.	Jo witte dat se sille.
I was not expecting a wife	Ik hie gjin frou ferwachte
I was afraid it might have been over	Ik wie bang dat it miskien oer gien wêze soe
To be of such a woman.	Fan sa'n frou wêze.
I hope you like them	Ik hoopje dat jo se leuk fine
I gave up and he knows it	Ik joech op en hy wit it
I need to talk to her and be sure	Ik moat mei har prate en der wis fan wêze
He can not make money.	Hy kin gjin jild meitsje.
It seemed good I think.	It like goed tink ik.
Do not even try to pretend that this never happened.	Besykje net iens te dwaan as dat dit noait bard is.
And hit it he did.	En rekke it hy die.
I did not want to think about that now	Dêr woe ik no net oan tinke
I did that, and the day seemed just right for us.	Ik die dat, en de dei like krekt op ús.
I felt something give	Ik fielde wat jaan
Just looking at her again after all that time.	Krekt sjen har wer nei al dy tiid.
What is bad is bad even when it is necessary.	Wat min is is min sels as it nedich is.
I feel something different	Ik fiel wat oars
I could not even look at her.	Ik koe net iens nei har sjen.
But there they were not ready yet.	Mar dêr wiene se noch net klear.
Maybe I should make it one day	Miskien moat ik ien dei meitsje
I did not ask much	Ik frege net folle
He waited hours, but heard nothing from you.	Hy wachte oeren, mar hearde neat fan dy.
I'll tell you where it is	Ik sil jo fertelle wêr't it is
And probably one more.	En nei alle gedachten noch ien.
Do not believe.	Leau net.
It was also something for me to look forward to.	It wie foar my ek wat om nei út te sjen.
I feel confident about it.	Ik fiel my der wis fan.
I leave it to the kids.	Ik lit it oan de bern oer.
That should help.	Dat moast helpe.
They do not want your house either.	Dy wolle jo hûs ek net.
Not even us.	Net iens ús.
I still wanted to be with him.	Ik woe noch by him wêze.
I had better go for it	Ik moast der better op gean
I think it could be a little better.	Ik tink dat it kin wat better.
What was it.	Wat wie it.
I would never hurt a child.	Ik soe noait in bern sear dwaan.
She was a little too free.	Se wie wat te frij.
This would be bad.	Dit soe min wurde.
I will not take it from you	Ik sil it net fan dy nimme
I would have done everything for him.	Ik soe alles foar him dien hawwe.
I really need to get ready for work	Ik moat my echt klear meitsje foar it wurk
I do not know why anyone would want this job.	Ik wit net wêrom immen dizze baan wol wolle.
He says that this will probably happen this year as well.	Hy seit dat dat dit jier wierskynlik ek sil barre.
His life.	Syn libben.
They never take off.	Se nimme nea ôf.
To have someone who looks after you.	Om ien te hawwen dy't nei dy sjocht.
I think even she knew what was going to happen.	Ik tink dat sels se wist wat der barre soe.
I only want one woman	Ik wol mar ien frou
He looks surprised that she is here too.	Hy sjocht ferrast dat se hjir ek is.
I can not believe she's doing all this	Ik kin net leauwe dat se dit alles docht
That was how he said it.	Dat wie hoe't hy it sei.
I see you doing that all the time	Ik sjoch dat jo dat de hiele tiid dogge
We did the best of three.	Wy diene it bêste fan trije.
I am very happy with that.	Dêr bin ik tige bliid mei.
I did not want to either	Ik woe ek net
I've been waiting my whole life for someone	Ik wachtsje myn hiele libben op immen
Go away now.	Gean no fuort.
I did not care how late it was	Ik hie der neat om hoe let it wie
I have worked very hard.	Ik haw hiel hurd wurke.
I will not even tell you	Ik sil it dy net iens fertelle
I'm the one who's here with you	Ik bin dejinge dy't hjir by dy is
You have it now.	Jo hawwe it no.
I am always, always have, always will	Ik bin altyd, altyd haw, altyd sil
I was a good wife to him	Ik wie in goede frou foar him
Here with me.	Hjir by my.
Nobody has a problem with that.	Nimmen hat dêr in probleem mei.
But she could be.	Mar se koe wêze.
I really have a little idea more about something	Ik haw echt in bytsje idee mear oer wat
I did not even have to say anything	Ik hoegde net iens wat te sizzen
I saw it go.	Ik seach it gean.
I see you doing that	Ik sjoch dat jo dat dogge
That's not me.	Dat bin ik net.
I only heard him talk a few times	Ik hearde him mar in pear kear praten
He must love his children.	Hy moat fan syn bern hâlde.
I would love to be with him	Ik mocht graach by him wêze
You know how he could be.	Jo witte hoe't hy koe wêze.
I know what it stands for	Ik wit wat der foar stiet
I thought, this is my life now	Ik tocht, dit is no myn libben
I was sure there was something	Ik wie der wis fan dat der wat wie
To be free and clear.	Om frij en dúdlik te wêzen.
And neither of us has a family.	En net ien fan ús hat gjin famylje.
I can wait until next week	Ik kin wachtsje oant nije wike
I think it does not make much sense	Ik tink dat it net folle makket
It can do that though.	Dat kin it wol dwaan.
See also another job.	Sjoch ek in oare baan.
She says he's not here.	Se seit dat er hjir net is.
We can buy you anything you want.	Wy kinne jo alles keapje wat jo wolle.
But there is no time.	Mar der is gjin tiid.
Be in the water.	Wês yn it wetter.
It's easy to see.	It is maklik te sjen.
I ask who is willing to do that	Ik freegje wa't ree is om dat te dwaan
Everything felt good.	Alles fielde goed.
I do not know if it really is.	Ik wit net oft it eins is.
I have more work to do here	Ik haw hjir mear wurk te dwaan
I did not want to go back to bed	Ik woe net wer op bêd
It should all come here.	It moat hjir allegear komme.
Husband and father.	Man en heit.
I want to talk to you about that	Dêr wol ik mei dy oer prate
I'm so glad we did.	Ik bin sa bliid dat wy dien hawwe.
I can no longer.	Ik kin it net mear.
It's been a long time coming, but we're glad it's done.	It hat lang west, mar wy binne bliid dat it dien is.
I just had to be careful	Ik moast mar foarsichtich wêze
She had enough time.	Se hie genôch tiid.
That's the best we can do.	Dat is it bêste dat wy kinne dwaan.
This makes things very easy.	Dit makket dingen hiel maklik.
I need some water.	Ik ha wat wetter nedich.
I think he did not have to go	Ik tink dat er net gean hoegde
I know they worked on it.	Ik wit dat se dêr oan wurke hawwe.
I did not realize you would be	Ik realisearre net dat jo wêze soene
Not that it could.	Net dat it koe.
I'm so worried about her	Ik bin sa soargen oer har
I assume that is not a bad idea.	Ik nim oan dat dat gjin min idee is.
You want them not to worry.	Jo wolle dat se gjin soargen meitsje.
Take your time and look around you.	Nim dyn tiid en sjoch om dy hinne.
It is easy to get water.	It is maklik om wetter te krijen.
I did not like this	Ik mocht hjir net fan hâlde
Two things happen.	Twa dingen barre.
I know they are talking about me	Ik wit dat se it oer my hawwe
It did three things.	It die trije dingen.
I liked him.	Ik mocht him graach.
It was just easy.	Dit wie net maklik.
I had to see this man	Ik moast dizze man sjen
She's not sure what we need.	Se is net wis wat wy nedich binne.
They need food.	Se hawwe iten nedich.
She knows it now, so little.	Se wit it no, sa'n bytsje.
I did not even see him	Ik haw him net iens sjoen
And now it may be too late	En no kin it te let wêze
So much.	Safolle.
Everything was so.	Alles wie sa.
I looked like another person	Ik seach as in oare persoan
I believe this is your family	Ik leau dat dit dyn famylje is
She looked at her husband.	Se seach har man oan.
I think she's already gone to work	Ik tink dat se al nei it wurk gien is
You can not, and with good reason.	Jo kinne net, en mei goede reden.
I did not see you there.	Ik seach dy dêr net.
I'll let you know how it goes	Ik sil jo witte hoe't it giet
She left nothing out.	Se liet neat út.
But it was more than three hours.	Mar it wie mear as trije oeren.
I have never had a friend in my entire life	Ik hie nea in freon yn myn hiele libben
Everything is fine with it.	Der is alles goed mei.
Let's get something to eat.	Litte wy wat te iten krije.
I know exactly who you are	Ik wit krekt wa't jo binne
That would not do.	Dat soe net dwaan.
Or so it seemed to me.	Of sa like it my ta.
Things have a way of coming.	Dingen hawwe in manier om te kommen.
Before you can be good, you must be bad.	Foardat jo goed kinne wêze, moatte jo min wêze.
I want us to have a family	Ik wol dat wy in famylje hawwe
My mother did that.	Myn mem die dat.
I can be hours away	Ik kin oeren fuort wêze
I think this guy had looked into it	Ik tink dat dizze keardel der nei sjoen hie
There was plenty to see.	Der wie genôch te sjen.
Glad he made it home.	Bliid dat hy it thús makke.
I have no idea what you're talking about.	Ik haw gjin idee wêr't jo it oer hawwe.
What do you want to do next ?.	Wat wolle jo folgjende dwaan?.
I could not see the other	Ik koe de oare net sjen
But it was a place for me to stay.	Mar it wie in plak foar my om te bliuwen.
I can help you out day in and day out.	Ik kin jo dei yn dei út helpe.
A door, like it	In doar, like it
I want to help, not hurt people	Ik wol helpe, minsken net sear meitsje
I really did not know why	Ik wist echt net wêrom
She said nothing.	Se sei neat.
He would be careful.	Hy soe foarsichtich wêze.
I thought so but wanted to say it	Ik tocht it mar woe it sizze
I would not, maybe not this evening	Ik soe net, miskien net dizze jûn
I did it really bad	Ik die it echt min
I could have surprised you	Ik koe dy ferrast hawwe
I had no idea.	Dêr hie ik gjin idee fan.
Tomorrow is the day.	Moarn is de dei.
Think of something else.	Tink oan wat oars.
I will not get into it.	Ik sil der net yn komme.
I have very good reason to	Ik haw hiel goede reden om
But together, as friends.	Mar tegearre, as freonen.
I was a really bad kid	Ik wie in echt min bern
They will be there.	Se sille der wêze.
I can not believe this worked	Ik kin net leauwe dat dit wurke
I looked out and did not see them	Ik seach út en seach se net
I want to be with my family	Ik wol by myn famylje wêze
She found what she needed to be happy with her life.	Se fûn wat se nedich wie om bliid te wêzen mei har libben.
Of course, no one died.	Fansels, gjinien stoar.
I did not want any of it	Ik woe der neat fan ha
I did not want to think so.	Ik woe net sa tinke.
That's what your job is.	Dat is wat jo wurk is.
But, something happens.	Mar, der bart wat.
I hope they become good friends	Ik hoopje dat se goede freonen wurde
Now it will be easy.	No sil it maklik wêze.
I love you and that is forever	Ik hâld fan dy en dat is foar altyd
I did not really think about this	Ik tocht hjir net echt oan
But my life is so different now.	Mar myn libben is no sa oars.
Maybe he did it, for one, it was something wrong.	Miskien hat hy, foar ien, it wat ferkeard.
She came herself.	Se kaam sels.
That makes me happy.	Dat makket my bliid.
She needs to know you have her back.	Se moat witte dat jo har werom hawwe.
They could not be more wrong.	Se koene net mear ferkeard wêze.
That was what she had hoped for.	Dat hie se hope.
I had never seen them carefully.	Ik hie se noch noait foarsichtich sjoen.
Do not look back.	Sjoch net werom.
You've never met them.	Jo hawwe se nea moete.
There are no words at all.	Der binne hielendal gjin wurden.
I told him in his mind	Ik fertelde him yn syn gedachten
Too much of it now.	Der no te folle fan.
There was something going on.	Der wie wat oan de hân.
I want to be there for her	Ik wol der foar har wêze
I just want you to be happy, but be careful	Ik wol gewoan dat jo bliid binne, mar foarsichtich
But it can also not be so.	Mar it kin ek net sa wêze.
I need to know what happened to her	Ik moat witte wat der mei har bard is
I know what to look for	Ik wit wêr't ik op moat sjen
I really like a lot of you	Ik hâld echt in protte fan dy
They can still do that.	Dat kinne se noch wol.
All this in one day.	Dit alles yn ien dei.
I just want to ask you	Ik wol dy mar freegje
They did their job.	Se diene har wurk.
I know it's not what you asked for	Ik wit dat it net is wat jo frege hawwe
His next book.	Syn folgjende boek.
I know there was food here last week	Ik wit dat hjir ferline wike iten wie
I know your mother knows that	Ik wit dat dyn mem dat wit
Nothing comes through.	Der komt neat troch.
I did not want to leave it in the car	Ik woe it net yn 'e auto litte
He has been a different class.	Hy hat in oare klasse west.
I feel like a fan.	Ik fiel my as in fan.
I think you can see better	Ik tink dat jo better sjen kinne
Three weeks ago.	Trije wike lyn.
It needed it.	It hie it nedich.
I can say what this is all about.	Ik kin sizze wêr't dit alles oer giet.
There is nothing left.	Der is neat oer.
I could ask for nothing more	Ik koe neat mear freegje
I've been with you all day	Ik bin de hiele dei by dy west
This was his first day on the job.	Dit wie syn earste dei op 'e baan.
I hope it's okay with you	Ik hoopje dat it goed is mei dy
Very few people visit.	Hiel pear minsken besykje.
That allowed her even more.	Dat mocht se noch mear.
I wonder what he thinks	Ik freegje my ôf wat er tinkt
I had the best time with her	Ik haw de bêste tiid mei har
He has never seen the man.	Hy hat de man nea sjoen.
And that's exactly how it will play out.	En dat is krekt hoe't it sil spylje.
I did not know what to make of myself	Ik wist net wat ik fan my meitsje moast
I actually did not want to talk to her right now.	Ik woe no eins net mei har prate.
I just tried.	Ik ha krekt besocht.
This worked for her.	Dit wurke foar har.
I could talk about anything.	Ik koe oer alles prate.
I have been eating this way ever since.	Ik haw sûnt dizze manier iten.
They were almost there.	Se wiene der hast.
I often think of you and your family	Ik tink faak oan dy en dyn famylje
I know that now more than ever before	Ik wit dat no mear as ea earder
I knew they would be natural.	Ik wist dat se fansels wêze soene.
We do not have it yet.	Wy hawwe it noch net.
I ran into him every now and then in town	Ik rûn him sa no en dan tsjin yn 'e stêd
I never thought children would be a problem	Ik hie noait tocht dat bern in probleem wêze soene
I see them all and they all look ready	Ik sjoch se allegear en se lykje allegear klear
But he's not angry.	Mar hy is net lilk.
I would not worry so much my young friend	Ik soe net safolle soargen myn jonge freon
I tried to talk myself out of it	Ik besocht my der út te praten
I bought a car yesterday.	Ik kocht juster in auto.
You've seen them.	Jo hawwe se sjoen.
There was a woman killed	Der wie in frou om it libben kaam
I'll never see him again	Ik sjoch him nea wer
I think she's just tired	Ik tink dat se gewoan wurch is
I really wish she had not said that	Ik woe echt dat se dat net sein hie
We will have a good time at home.	Wy sille it goed thús hawwe.
Soon they were back too.	Al gau wiene se ek werom.
I had no say in what to get	Ik hie gjin sizzen oer wat te krijen
Not easy, actually, for any of us.	Net maklik, eins, foar ien fan ús.
I think he already knew	Ik tink dat hy it al wist
Well, not exactly that.	No, net krekt dat.
I know them very well	Ik ken se hiel goed
I did not even care if it was true.	Ik hie der net iens om as it wier wie.
I think he did it again	Ik tink dat hy it wer die
You need to take some time.	Jo moatte wat tiid nimme.
He's that man now.	Hy is no dy man.
I'm not what you believe	Ik bin net wat jo leauwe
They have nothing to say about me.	Se hawwe neat oer my.
This year she did not go to her parents' house.	Dit jier gie se net nei it hûs fan har âlden.
She was no longer afraid.	Se wie net mear bang.
My parents had done a good job.	Myn âlden hiene in goed wurk dien.
It was easy to see why.	It wie maklik om te sjen wêrom.
That did not matter.	Dat hoegde net.
He had to talk to her.	Hy moast mei har prate.
It just got better and better.	It waard gewoan better en better.
This is just one of you	Dit is mar ien fan dy
He's at school.	Hy is op skoalle.
It was more of the same.	It wie mear fan itselde.
Whatever that was, we did not need it.	Wat dat ek wie, wy hiene it net nedich.
That was.	Dat wie.
If he's up for it, that's right.	As hy der op oan is, dat wol.
And now they were both gone.	En no wiene se beide fuort.
I have prepared myself for this	Ik haw my klear makke foar dit
I did not like this at all	Ik mocht dit hielendal net
I probably started without being well prepared	Ik bin wierskynlik begûn sûnder goed klear te wêzen
It was not long enough.	It wie net lang genôch.
He looked over.	Hy seach oer.
We put him to bed.	Wy sette him op bêd.
I would like more than that	Ik soe mear wolle as dat
I think my dad would really like you	Ik tink dat myn heit jo echt leuk fine soe
I just want to see them	Ik wol se gewoan sjen
And here they may be.	En hjir kinne se wol wêze.
It's such a thing.	It is sa'n ding.
They will talk.	Se sille prate.
I'm a woman.	Ik bin in frou.
That child wants for nothing.	Dat bern wol foar neat.
I wanted to hurt him	Ik woe him sear dwaan
I know that looks bad	Ik wit dat sjocht der min
I certainly would have done things differently	Ik soe de dingen wis oars dien hawwe
I have not had that since	Dat haw ik sûnt dy tiid net hân
A very long time ago	In hiel lang lyn
I would not be here today	Ik soe hjir hjoed net wêze
I knew him from back	Ik koe him fan werom
This is long enough !.	Dizze is lang genôch!.
As in forever.	As yn foar altyd.
I've never told you that before	Dat haw ik dy nea earder sein
To his dog.	Oan syn hûn.
A few years it will tell us	In pear jier sil it ús fertelle
That's how they work.	Dat is hoe't se wurkje.
And even more.	En noch mear.
I had to tell her so many things	Ik moast har safolle dingen fertelle
Take a little habituation.	Nim in bytsje wenne oan.
Many of these are very good	In protte fan dizze binne heul goed
Maybe the following.	Miskien de folgjende.
He has been ill.	Hy hat siik west.
He keeps going.	Hy hâldt troch.
They really do matter.	Se dogge echt ta.
He was a man who knew well.	Hy wie in man dy't goed koe.
That's what I love about him	Dat hâlde ik fan him ôf
But now he was here.	Mar no wie er hjir.
I'm going to ask someone why	Ik gean frege immen wêrom
Talk about something else.	Praat oer wat oars.
I believe we met at the party	Ik leau dat wy op it feest moete binne
I had no idea what to do or say	Ik hie gjin idee wat te dwaan of te sizzen
I have some idea about how time works	Ik haw wat idee oer hoe't tiid wurket
But he did not like it.	Mar hy mocht it net.
Go now, please.	Gean no, asjebleaft.
Father.	Heit.
He did not want to talk to me about work.	Hy woe net graach mei my oer wurk prate.
You can take my word for it.	Dêr kinne jo myn wurd foar nimme.
He watched the movie with me.	Hy seach de film mei my.
I can not do him any good otherwise	Ik kin him oars gjin goed dwaan
I should have told you all this myself	Ik hie jo dit alles sels fertelle moatten
I had to see them again	Ik moast se wer sjen
I hope it has for you	Ik hoopje dat it foar jo hat
Well, that's a good name.	No, dat is in goede namme.
They are afraid of it.	Se binne der bang foar.
You have to worry about him.	Jo moatte soargen oer him.
I've never said it enough	Ik haw it noait genôch sein
I have to do what's right	Ik moat dwaan wat goed is
Things happen to us.	Dingen barre mei ús.
They met for an hour.	Se moete foar in oere.
I wanted to be with my family	Ik woe by myn famylje wêze
Which was not long.	Wat wie net lang.
I think it could be something	Ik tink dat it wat wêze kin
I just need to talk to him	Ik moat gewoan mei him prate
But they are not the same.	Mar se binne net itselde.
That's not me anymore.	Dat is my net mear.
It is not seen quite the same here.	It wurdt hjir net hielendal itselde sjoen.
Try to make the past right.	Besykje it ferline goed te meitsjen.
I do not let her be more than that	Ik lit har net mear wêze as dat
These were the best ever.	Dit wiene de bêste ea.
What it was maybe.	Wat it miskien wie.
The child.	It bern.
I thought you might be tired	Ik tocht dat jo miskien wêze wurch
They had always talked on the lake.	Se hiene altyd praat op 'e mar.
I was planning to go.	Ik wie fan plan om te gean.
And so far, so good.	En oant no ta, sa goed.
He knew he would never.	Hy wist dat er noait soe.
The new plan.	It nije plan.
He's just the first.	Hy is mar de earste.
They want things they can not.	Se wolle dingen dy't se net kinne.
They just say what is.	Se sizze gewoan wat is.
I'm sure you do too.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo ek dogge.
I was with a friend in that prison one day	Ik wie op in dei by in freon yn dy finzenis
You can not come here.	Jo kinne hjir net komme.
What is the.	Wat is de.
You yourself have said just as much.	Jo hawwe sels krekt safolle sein.
Then we would go on the road.	Dan soene wy ​​op 'e wei gean.
I have a life, a family	Ik haw in libben, in famylje
You can tell.	Jo kinne sizze.
Of course, none of us could know.	Fansels koe gjinien fan ús witte.
I bought all the food	Ik kocht al it iten
The girl is even better.	It famke is noch better.
I thought the whole thing would come to me.	Ik tocht dat it hiele ding by my komme soe.
I never knew there was so much of it.	Ik wist noait dat der safolle fan wie.
That was more than three years ago.	Dat wie mear as trije jier lyn.
It was his favorite.	It wie syn favorite.
I've seen what happened	Ik haw sjoen wat der bard is
Where exactly, we did not know yet.	Wêr krekt, wisten wy noch net.
They were good kids.	It wiene goede bern.
Even now he was angry at her.	Ek no wie er lilk op har.
He is ready for it.	Hy is der klear foar.
And we have.	En wy hawwe.
I did not want to be scared anymore	Ik woe net mear bang wêze
She knew what she wanted to say, but she did not say it.	Se wist wat se sizze woe, mar se sei it net.
Nothing was clear.	Neat wie dúdlik.
He says, mother.	Hy seit, mem.
They can say whatever they want.	Se kinne sizze wat se wolle.
That's exactly who we are.	Dat is krekt wa't wy binne.
But there was one more thing.	Mar der wie noch ien ding.
It will be seen.	It sil sjoen wurde.
For someone to come.	Foar immen om te kommen.
My mother could not stop telling me how beautiful she was.	Myn mem koe net ophâlde my te fertellen hoe moai se wie.
I always talk to her	Ik praat altyd mei har
There but not there, so to speak.	Dêr mar net dêr, om sa te sizzen.
It all went too hard for me	It gie my allegear te hurd
I'm exactly the same way.	Ik bin krekt deselde manier.
I wanted to go back to my past	Ik woe werom nei myn ferline
I can do this though	Ik kin dit wol
So, we'm waiting for you.	Dat, wy wachtsje op jo.
I never wanted to go back.	Ik woe noait werom.
I can not go back from there now	Ik kin der no net mear fan werom
I just knew his name	Ik wist krekt syn namme
The only one who does not do that is her old one, 'said the boy.	De iennichste dy't dat net docht, is har âld,' sei de jonge.
I did not have enough time to see him	Ik hie net genôch tiid om him te sjen
It does more.	It docht mear.
I did not know where that question came from	Ik wist net wêr't dy fraach wei kaam
She talks to the police.	Se praat mei de plysje.
He is so alone.	Hy is sa allinnich.
You found me.	Jo hawwe my fûn.
But it comes.	Mar it komt.
He thought about it.	Hy tocht der oer nei.
I have more to say.	Ik haw mear te sizzen.
Or maybe that had been the plan all along.	Of miskien hie dat al de hiele tiid it plan west.
They are friends of mine.	Se binne freonen fan my.
I tried not to get angry	Ik besocht net lilk te wurden
But on another job.	Mar op in oare baan.
I liked it all, actually	Ik fûn it allegear leuk, eins
Me neither.	Ik ek net.
We do not have to worry about those things.	Wy hoege ús gjin soargen te meitsjen oer dy dingen.
No one else would go.	Nimmen oars soe gean.
I see her here	Ik sjoch har hjir hinne sjen
I like that a lot, for one reason or another	Ik haw dat in protte, om ien of oare reden
We did not expect them to come.	Wy hiene net ferwachte dat se komme soene.
I do not want you to worry about anything	Ik wol net dat jo jo wat soargen meitsje
The girl, she's fine.	It famke, se is goed.
I think we have a problem	Ik tink dat wy in probleem hawwe
I can no longer have you in my house	Ik kin dy net mear yn myn hûs hawwe
I have not had a wife here either	Ik haw hjir ek gjin frou hân
I just love you.	Ik hâld gewoan fan dy.
In fact, they were there.	Eins wiene se der.
I did not know how to wake her up	Ik wist net hoe't ik har wekker meitsje moast
Just a few years.	Krekt in pear jier.
It's his parents.	It binne syn âlden.
Well, she's not wrong.	No, se is net ferkeard.
I have to think clearly	Ik moat dúdlik tinke
It's in my mind, and so it is in you.	It is yn myn gedachten, en sa is it yn dy.
I expected you to say what you did	Ik ferwachte dat jo sizze wat jo dien hawwe
They know two things.	Se witte twa dingen.
I also did not say a word	Ik sei ek gjin wurd
I know you still love me	Ik wit dat jo noch fan my hâlde
That was my day.	Dat wie myn dei.
But no one would see it.	Mar nimmen soe it sjen.
Now let's try something to see if they work differently.	Litte wy no wat besykje om te sjen oft se oars wurkje.
But she needs to look back.	Mar se moat har werom sjen.
He was not that kind.	Hy wie net sa'n soarte.
I almost never buy anything	Ik keapje hast noait wat
Maybe he can help us.	Hy kin ús miskien helpe.
I'll come to you wherever you are	Ik sil by jo komme wêr't jo ek binne
I hope to see him again soon	Ik hoopje him gau wer te sjen
I will be such a good mother.	Ik sil sa'n goede mem wêze.
Try to make.	Besykje te meitsjen.
He saw nothing.	Hy seach neat.
I have to take her now	Ik moat har no nimme
And she had planned to tell him that week.	En se hie fan plan west om him dy wike te fertellen.
I can see nothing more	Ik kin neat mear sjen
I felt really good.	Ik fielde my eins goed.
In other words, they come through.	Mei oare wurden, se komme troch.
I knew it was	Ik wist wol dat it wie
You do not have them.	Jo hawwe se net.
The problem is that it has never been here before.	It probleem is dat it hjir noch noait earder west hat.
I love good help for people	Ik hâld fan in goede help foar minsken
I ran into someone who knows you.	Ik rûn ien tsjin dy't dy ken.
And now this must happen.	En no moat dit barre.
I pretended I knew nothing	Ik die of ik neat wist
I'll make it easy for you.	Ik sil it jo maklik meitsje.
Know that it will get through.	Wit dat it der troch sil komme.
I'm happy to be alone every now and then	Ik bin bliid om sa no en dan allinnich te wêzen
That's the best they can do.	Dat is it bêste dat se kinne dwaan.
I haven't talked to him enough yet, to see	Ik haw noch net genôch mei him praat, om te sjen
I hope they were all good	Ik hoopje dat se allegear goed wiene
But where people are.	Mar wêr't minsken binne.
I thought coming home for dinner would be nice	Ik tocht thús komme foar it iten soe moai wêze
Since she can not and he will not.	Sûnt se kin net en hy sil net.
To put it bluntly, there is something for everyone.	Om it dúdlik te sizzen, der is wat foar elkenien.
I wish it was, but it is not	Ik woe dat it wie, mar it is net
Could clearly know.	Koe dúdlik witte.
I would have liked to have been away sooner but not	Ik hie graach earder fuort west mar net
There are other things that are needed to do that.	D'r binne oare dingen dy't nedich binne om dat te dwaan.
I saw you.	Ik seach dy sjen.
But there was also something else in it.	Mar der siet ek wat oars yn.
That's not what happened, that's wrong.	Sa barde it net, dat is ferkeard.
It looks very real.	It sjocht der hiel echt út.
You love her.	Jo hâlde fan har.
Now this child gets sick every now and then.	No wurdt dit bern sa no en dan siik.
I really care about you	Ik sjoch echt om dy
I was hurt by your name	Ik hie sear út jo namme
Looked pretty nice, otherwise.	Seach der moai moai út, oars.
This is what you want.	Dit is wat jo wolle.
I was just trying things out	Ik besocht gewoan dingen út
I did the same.	Ik die der itselde oan.
That was for sure.	Dat wie wis.
Even if he does not have to.	Ek al hoecht er net.
It's the best for now.	It is it bêste foar no.
There must be another way.	Der moat in oare manier wêze.
I had just met this man	Ik hie dizze man krekt moete
I believe in what we do here	Ik leau yn wat wy hjir dogge
So she asked for time to read it.	Sa frege se om tiid om it te lêzen.
There are none.	Der binne gjin.
That's not what you'll know.	Dat is net wat jo sille witte.
And he had a meeting, nothing happened with the meeting.	En hy hie in gearkomste, der barde neat mei de gearkomste.
I think we have it.	Ik tink dat wy it hawwe.
Go to your friend's house.	Gean nei it hûs fan dyn freon.
I felt that way too	Ik fielde my ek sa
I did not expect that	Dat hie ik net ferwachte
I still want to be with you	Ik wol noch by dy wêze
I think you should know that	Ik tink dat jo dat witte moatte
I hope this is the last time this year	Ik hoopje dat dit dit jier de lêste kear is
They just keep me going.	Se hâlde my gewoan ôf.
I've had it for a little over a year now.	Ik haw it al wat mear as in jier hân.
Of course, they could not believe him if he did.	Fansels kinne se him net leauwe as hy dat die.
And it works.	En it wurket.
He never said it.	Hy hat it noait sein.
I should have seen you better	Ik hie dy better sjen moatten
I'm like a good woman.	Ik bin as in goede frou.
There will be a meeting, she said.	Der komt in gearkomste, sei se.
I do not know how long he has been away.	Ik wit net hoe lang er fuort west hat.
They leave everything to the mother and it's wrong.	Se litte alles oan de mem oer en it is ferkeard.
You do not want to know about it.	Dêr wolle jo net fan witte.
I plan to get myself a whole lot really soon	Ik plan om my in hiele protte echt gau te krijen
There they come, he thought.	Dêr komme se, tocht er.
I wondered if he did that with other people	Ik frege my ôf oft er dat mei oare minsken die
I want you to love this.	Ik wol dat jo dit hâlde.
I assume you know that	Ik nim oan dat jo dat witte
Two things actually.	Twa dingen eins.
Words are not good.	Wurden binne net goed.
I will not tell you again	Ik sil it dy net wer fertelle
I have some work to do.	Ik haw wat wurk te dwaan.
I almost never saw him at home	Ik seach him hast noait thús
I can tell it by looking at you.	Ik kin it fertelle troch nei dy te sjen.
Not forever, of course.	Net foar altyd, fansels.
He's yours and you probably know he's yours.	Hy is fan jo en jo witte wierskynlik dat hy fan jo is.
I knew that very well	Dat wist ik hiel goed
The idea that you can be anything you want to be.	It idee dat jo alles kinne wêze wat jo wolle.
Nobody looked at her.	Nimmen seach har oan.
I have not decided what to do	Ik haw net besletten wat te dwaan
I love helping you	Ik hâld fan dy te helpen
I can not believe it's in my house	Ik kin net leauwe dat it yn myn hûs is
This looks pretty bad.	Dit sjocht der aardich min út.
But not alone.	Mar noch net allinnich.
But it was your mother who hurt me first.	Mar it wie dyn mem dy't my earst sear die.
Well, this is home now.	No, dit is no thús.
This happens from time to time.	Dit bart fan tiid ta tiid.
I could not agree with her	Ik koe har net iens
She was a child.	Se wie in bern.
Here was where we talked.	Hjir wie wêr't wy prate.
I need to have Water.	Ik moat Wetter hawwe.
And nothing worked.	En neat wurke.
I want to have a family.	Ik wol in famylje hawwe.
I think it should be fine	Ik tink dat it goed moat
I know how that is	Ik wit hoe't dat is
I should let them know what we do	Ik soe se litte moatte wat wy dogge
This had to be him.	Dit moast him wêze.
I asked him if it was from him	Ik frege him oft it fan him wie
There may be.	Der kin wêze.
A new woman.	In nije frou.
I had not decided what to do	Ik hie net besletten wat te dwaan
I need to make it better	Ik moat it better meitsje
Please think about it.	Tink der asjebleaft oer.
I can not see him now.	Ik kin him no net sjen.
But we did not talk about me.	Mar wy hiene it net oer my.
Just be careful of him.	Wês mar foarsichtich fan him.
Then again, he's just like my dad.	Dan wer, hy is krekt as myn heit.
We talked a bit and he asked me out.	Wy prate in bytsje en hy frege my út.
A lot happened.	Der wie in protte bard.
That is not the case.	Dat is it net iens.
That someone was a mother.	Dat immen in mem wie.
I told him exactly what it was.	Ik fertelde him krekt wat it wie.
I know what they're saying about this.	Ik wit wat se sizze oer dit.
This is not a good time.	Dat is gjin goede tiid.
My friends are here.	Myn freonen binne hjir.
I did everything work well.	Ik haw alles goed wurkje.
I was worried about nothing	Ik makke my soargen oer neat
I wish it did not hurt you	Ik winskje dat it net sear hoegde foar dy
Even hard work.	Sels is hurd wurk.
It's just that easy.	It is krekt sa maklik.
I looked at her a few times.	Ik seach in pear kear nei har.
But she did it for her husband.	Mar se die it foar har man.
I'm not such a man.	Ik bin net sa'n man.
One more thing to do before we go back.	Noch ien ding te dwaan foardat wy werom geane.
I did not ask him anything	Ik haw him neat frege
How it all happens.	Hoe't it allegear bart.
You can think hard for this.	Jo kinne tinke hurd foar dit.
I could not see a way through	Ik koe gjin wei troch sjen
I did not know her for long	Ik koe har net lang
However, she would never stop him.	Hoe dan ek, se soe him noait wat tsjin hâlde.
I was wrong, it seems.	Ik wie ferkeard, liket it.
He would do anything for her.	Hy soe alles foar har dwaan.
They should have no problem.	Se moatte gjin probleem hawwe.
To be sick is to be sick.	Siik wêze is siik wêze.
As a person.	As in persoan.
I had done it.	Ik hie it dien.
It's a bad time.	It is in minne tiid.
They need to go together.	Se moatte tegearre gean.
But maybe it did not matter.	Mar miskien makke it neat út.
I looked at my bike and there was something wrong	Ik seach nei myn fyts en der wie wat net goed
We can go now.	Wy kinne no gean.
Not once, but over and over again.	Net ien kear, mar oer en wer.
Things happen for a reason.	Dingen barre foar in reden.
It seemed to him but of course to come.	It like him mar fansels te kommen.
I'll talk to her first	Ik sil earst mei har prate
I just had to get to you	Ik moast mar by dy komme
The work was completed in one hour.	It wurk wie yn ien oere klear.
I have not had days	Ik haw gjin dagen hân
That's the word.	Dat is it wurd.
Nothing to say.	Neat te sizzen.
In his life now.	Yn syn libben no.
Needless to say, the time together was fun.	Mar it is net nedich om te sizzen, de tiid tegearre wie leuk.
I did not hear a word from him.	Ik hearde der gjin wurd fan.
They can even be good, really good.	Se kinne sels goed wêze, echt goed.
And there it is.	En dêr stiet it.
I would tell him not to do it	Ik soe him sizze dat er it net dwaan moat
They do it often.	Se dogge dit faak.
To say what he has to say	Om te sizzen wat er te sizzen hat
There was nothing else for it.	Der wie neat oars foar.
I wanted to make that clear	Ik woe dat dúdlik meitsje
His father took it hard.	Syn heit naam it hurd oan.
Of course, this is what my parents once did.	Fansels is dit wat myn âlden eartiids diene.
I looked at her and saw where she was looking	Ik seach har oan en seach wêr't se seach
I think you have a good idea	Ik tink dat jo in goed idee hawwe
I do not think it can be better than that	Ik tocht net dat it better kin as dat
A better friend has never had a wife	In bettere freon hie gjin frou ea
I've been trying to talk to you for days	Ik haw al dagen besocht mei jo te praten
Maybe we talked to her.	Miskien hawwe wy mei har praat.
I should have done it	Ik moast it dien hawwe
None of these people think they have a problem.	Net ien fan dizze minsken tinkt dat se in probleem hawwe.
She could not see him, and she was happy.	Se koe him net sjen, en se wie bliid.
I told you the truth	Ik fertelde dy de wierheid
Do your thing.	Doch dyn ding.
The police tried to prevent her from doing so.	De plysje besocht har dat foar te kommen.
They could see him.	Se koene him sjen.
The class was fun to watch, it was her first week.	De klasse wie leuk om te sjen, it wie har earste wike.
I want what will make my mother happy	Ik wol wat myn mem bliid meitsje sil
I have to be something	Ik moat wat wêze
I saw what it was like.	Ik seach hoe't it wie.
I did not really have one in mind	Ik hie net echt ien yn gedachten
I have to think time	Ik moat tiid tinke
I think we are.	Ik tink dat wy binne.
We did not hurt anyone.	Wy hawwe gjinien sear dien.
I want him here right now	Ik wol him hjir no krekt
That works for me.	Dat wurket foar my.
Mom was not up yet.	Mem wie noch net op.
I have more questions.	Ik haw mear fragen.
Whether it worked or not did not matter.	Oft it wurke of net makke neat út.
And the car.	En de auto.
Somehow she had gotten them back.	Op ien of oare manier hie se se werom krigen.
No one has seen it done so.	Nimmen hat it sa dien sjoen.
No money.	Gjin jild.
But, not everything is so.	Mar, net alles is sa.
Come on, you know you want to.	Kom op, jo witte dat jo wolle.
He went away to come with you.	Hy gie fuort om mei jo te kommen.
That's what's in your class.	Dat is wat yn jo klasse is.
We decided that was it.	Wy besletten dat is it.
Just showed what a little money could do.	Krekt liet sjen wat in bytsje jild koe.
I rather want to do something	Ik haw earder wol wat te dwaan
I think we're ready to go	Ik tink dat wy klear binne om te gean
I did not think it was from him	Ik tocht net dat it fan him wie
I know she will	Ik wit dat se sil
But you do not have to worry about that.	Mar dêr hoege jo gjin soargen oer te hawwen.
I had no idea where I was going.	Ik hie gjin idee wêr't ik hinne moast.
I hope you will help us.	Ik hoopje dat jo ús sille helpe.
That is not exactly true.	Dat is net krekt wier.
Maybe it would be different this time.	Miskien soe it dizze kear oars wêze.
I thought he had you	Ik tocht dat hy dy hie
She was angry.	Se wie lilk.
I do not know the man who speaks	Ik ken de man dy't praat net
I was thinking about what you said in that room	Ik tocht oer wat jo seine yn dy keamer
As everyone does.	As elkenien docht.
And he wants everyone to know.	En hy wol dat elkenien it wit.
I will not let anyone do that again	Ik lit gjinien dat wer dwaan
You do not stop.	Jo hâlde net op.
Today, this could no longer be true.	Hjoed koe dit net mear wier wêze.
But, there is something more.	Mar, der is wat mear.
That we need your help.	Dat wy hawwe jo help nedich.
I do not think he would like it.	Ik tink net dat er it leuk fine soe.
I also could not always be seen or heard by people	Ik koe ek net altyd sjoen of heard wurde troch minsken
I will also need some help.	Ik sil ek wat help nedich hawwe.
In other words, it's pretty good.	Mei oare wurden, it is aardich goed.
I took it and walked with it	Ik naam it en rûn mei
I would love to have him	Ik woe him wol graach wolle
But this.	Mar dit.
It always has been, and it always will be.	It hat altyd west, en it sil altyd wêze.
It was not really for me.	It wie net echt foar my.
Plenty of.	In protte.
We should have won last night.	Wy hiene fannacht winne moatten.
But it will never happen again.	Mar it sil nea wer barre.
I thought about the time it happened to me	Ik tocht oer de tiid dat it my barde
I was the next person	Ik wie de folgjende persoan
You think you have this thing right now.	Jo tinke dat jo dit ding no krekt hawwe.
I can not tell you one thing that made me better.	Ik kin dy net sizze ien ding dat makke my better.
That's what you heard.	Dat hearde jo.
I can not find the words	Ik kin de wurden net fine
I just did not expect such a thing	Ik hie gewoan net sa'n ding ferwachte
I think he was just trying to do the right thing.	Ik tink dat hy gewoan besocht it goede ding te dwaan.
She must be worried sick.	Se moat wêze soargen siik.
She could see.	Se koe sjen.
One says, this works well.	Ien seit, dit wurket goed.
He questioned them, but they were children.	Hy frege har út, mar it wiene bern.
I did not want to do that	Dat woe ik net dwaan
It should have made me angry.	It hie my lilk meitsje moatten.
You know the guy is a bad guy.	Jo witte dat de keardel in minne keardel is.
It also seemed pretty bad to us.	It like ús ek aardich min.
I can make it easy	Ik kin it maklik meitsje
There will be an opportunity.	Der sil in kâns wêze.
Well, that was not the case.	No, sa wie it eins net.
Nothing happened.	Der bart neat.
I'll give it to him.	Ik sil it him jaan.
He can talk.	Hy kin prate.
I'm just back in town	Ik bin krekt werom yn 'e stêd
I've thought about those days for a long time	Ik haw lang oer dy dagen tocht
I quickly got away from her, almost walking	Ik kaam gau by har wei, hast rûn
He can not talk to her.	Hy kin net mei har prate.
But of course we want you to come.	Mar wy wolle fansels dat jo komme.
There was more to come.	Der kaam mear.
As beautiful as ever.	Sa moai as altyd.
I would need more time though	Ik soe wol mear tiid nedich wêze
Think about.	Tinke oer.
I almost did not want to leave anymore	Ik woe hast net mear fuort
We want to win.	Wy wolle winne.
Here's another one.	Hjir is noch ien.
She was sure of it.	Se wie der wis fan.
There is only me.	Der is allinnich ik.
I think this will work	Ik tink dat dit sil wurkje
You did nothing wrong.	Jo hawwe neat ferkeard dien.
I felt nothing	Ik fielde neat
I know how much time you have	Ik wit hoefolle tiid jo hawwe
It was hard to see the house through his talking.	It wie dreech om it hûs troch syn praten te sjen.
Here you are, and no one through.	Hjir binne jo, en gjinien troch.
And he is.	En hy is.
This may or may not be what you want.	Dit kin of miskien net wêze wat jo wolle.
As if they never happened.	As binne se nea bard.
It can also take a life.	It kin ek in libben nimme.
Even the child had something.	Sels it bern hie wat.
I have so many questions	Ik haw safolle fragen
I would just go to dinner	Ik soe gewoan nei it iten gean
He liked how she walked.	Hy mocht graach hoe't se rûn.
I have not seen it before	Ik haw it noch net earder sjoen
Please try again.	Besykje it asjebleaft.
But many will still,.	Mar in protte sille noch,.
I love things being done	Ik hâld fan dingen dien wurde
I go through it every day	Ik gean der alle dagen troch
I think that would be nice	Ik tink dat soe wêze moai
He had no idea what to say.	Hy hie gjin idee wat er sizze moast.
You do not do that.	Dat dogge jo net.
The girl does.	It famke docht.
I do things the right way	Ik doch dingen op 'e goede manier
This went over better.	Dit gie better oer.
I could do nothing to help	Ik koe neat dwaan om te helpen
I still remember the bus coming at me	Ik wit noch dat de bus op my kaam
It was just this.	It wie krekt dit.
I should have helped those people	Ik hie dy minsken helpe moatten
I tried to go back	Ik besocht werom te gean
I have it here	Ik haw it hjir
I was sure they would not	Ik wie der wis fan dat se net soene
It does not matter to you what happens.	It makket jo neat út wat der bart.
He knew.	Hy wist.
I wish him well.	Ik winskje him wol goed.
I had to do what needed to be done	Ik moast dwaan wat der dien wurde moast
I just had to be sure, that's all	Ik moast gewoan wis wêze, dat is alles
You said everything.	Jo hawwe alles sein.
She was my father.	Se wie myn heit.
I want you to stay here	Ik wol dat jo hjir bliuwe
I do not know why she told you that.	Ik wit net wêrom se dy dat ferteld hat.
I hope you know the same	Ik hoopje dat jo itselde witte
I could never tell anyone about him	Ik koe noait immen oer him fertelle
I was wondering something	Ik frege my wol wat ôf
There's probably a good chance it does.	D'r is wierskynlik in goede kâns dat it docht.
He could not believe what he heard.	Hy koe net leauwe wat er hearde.
She's going to the city next month.	Se giet der takom moanne foar nei de stêd.
Everyone seemed too tired.	Elkenien wie te wurch.
To get out of here.	Om hjir út te kommen.
So did my mother.	Dat hie myn mem ek.
How long had it been.	Hoe lang wie it west.
I will not do this again	Ik sil dit net mear dwaan
There has been none.	Der hat gjin west.
I will not be with her	Ik sil net by har wêze
I would not let him come to me	Ik soe him net ta my komme litte
It was a whole day.	It wie in hiele dei.
There they met for the first time.	Dêr moete se foar it earst.
Or what kind of man, really.	Of hokker soarte fan man, echt.
It looks like we did something he could not.	It liket derop dat wy wat dien hiene dat hy net koe.
I did not like this room	Ik mocht dizze keamer net
I did take a few things off of it though	Ik naam der wol in pear dingen fan ôf
He came for something else.	Hy kaam foar wat oars.
Sure you do not have to.	Wis dat jo net hoege.
Everyone talks about doing it.	Elkenien praat oer it dwaan.
I was not even sure she wanted me that way	Ik wie der net iens wis fan dat se my op dy manier woe
A way to see them	In manier om se te sjen
There seemed to be nothing else to do.	Der like neat oars te dwaan.
I have to let him go and hope	Ik moat him gean litte en hoopje
I was looking forward to the party	Ik seach út nei it feest
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Fertel my asjebleaft wat jo tinke.
There are many things to like about this book.	D'r binne in protte dingen te leuk oer dit boek.
I know a lot of you	Ik wit in protte fan dy
But nothing very much.	Mar neat hiel folle.
Go on your way.	Gean op dyn wei.
I thought she wanted better	Ik tocht dat se better woe
I had no idea you were here	Ik hie gjin idee dat jo hjir wiene
I never told her, never	Ik haw har noait ferteld, nea
I was afraid it was so much	Ik wie bang dat it sa folle wie
That also seems true.	Dat liket ek wier.
I hope for the latter	Ik hope op it lêste
No chance of getting it back.	Gjin kâns om it werom te krijen.
I had to leave to get back to work	Ik moast fuort om wer oan it wurk te kommen
I also could not look away	Ik koe ek net fuort sjen
I heard what you said	Ik hearde wat jo seine
I did not want to go back to the party	Ik woe net werom nei it feest
And that must be it.	En dat moat it wêze.
I can not get away from him	Ik kin net fan him ôf
See where you're going.	Sjoch wêr't jo hinne geane.
I just thought you might like this place	Ik tocht krekt dat jo dit plak leuk fine wolle
Mom is the only one who really can not.	Mem is de iennichste dy't it eins net kin.
You do that, and he knows where we are.	Jo dogge dat, en hy wit wêr't wy binne.
I had never told anyone	Ik hie it noait oan ien ferteld
Time to find your bike.	Tiid om jo fyts te finen.
Maybe she had.	Miskien hie se.
But it was none of that.	Mar it wie neat fan dat.
I just knew it felt so good	Ik wist gewoan dat it sa goed fielde
I think it was a bit of both	Ik tink dat it wie in bytsje fan beide
I did not see one or anything	Ik seach net ien of wat
I'm really happy.	Ik bin echt bliid.
Not with me this time.	Net by my dizze kear.
I wonder if he's ever been here	Ik freegje my ôf oft er hjir oait west hat
Do not go in there yet.	Gean der noch net op yn.
I went to school with your mother	Ik gie mei dyn mem nei skoalle
It may not be, but the boy has done it.	It kin net, mar de jonge hat it dien.
I was just hoping for more	Ik hie gewoan op mear hope
I thought hard.	Ik tocht hurd.
I wanted her all the time	Ik woe har de hiele tiid
But that was no longer true.	Mar dat wie net mear wier.
Time to be away.	Tiid om fuort te wêzen.
But not really working.	Mar net echt wurkje.
So it stands.	Sa stiet it sa.
I just made it in one go	Ik makke it gewoan yn ien kear
Here it is now.	Hjir is it no.
Neither good nor bad.	Noch goed noch min.
I know the right word	Ik wit it goede wurd
The plan worked.	It plan wurke.
Then we eat.	Dan ite wy.
We have to let you go now.	Wy moatte dy no gean litte.
He felt that it did him no good at all.	Hy fielde dat it him hielendal net goed die.
They knew he was coming.	Se wisten dat er kaam.
There was no way he could do that.	D'r wie gjin manier dat hy dat barre koe.
Do something else.	Wat oars dwaan.
I wondered if this was so	Ik frege my ôf oft dit sa is
That's the good one.	Dat is de goede.
There is something wrong.	Der is ferkeard.
I want to make her happy forever	Ik wol har foar altyd bliid meitsje
I wish no good would come your way.	Ik winskje dat der gjin goed op jo wei komme soe.
But that will not be enough.	Mar dat sil net genôch wêze.
I do not want to talk about that yet.	Dêr wol ik noch net oer prate.
Now we'm talking.	No binne wy ​​oan it praten.
I will leave it only one way, when the time comes.	Ik sil it mar ien manier litte, as de tiid komt.
He thought of the woman.	Hy tocht oan de frou.
I just have to believe	Ik moat mar leauwe
I wanted to stay alive to find my mother	Ik woe yn libben bliuwe om myn mem te finen
There said the old man.	Dêr sei de âld man.
Both things are true.	Beide dingen binne wier.
I was really scared now	Ik wie no echt bang
I know how it's done.	Ik wit hoe't it dien wurdt.
After all, still living with parents.	Nei alle gedachten noch wennet by âlden.
Everyone wants something.	Elkenien wol wat.
But that's hard to say.	Mar dat is dreech te sizzen.
That has never been so likely.	Dat hat noait sa wierskynlik west.
I still have that problem	Ik ha dat probleem noch
She was surprised to find her father there.	Se wie ferrast har heit dêr te finen.
They can do anything for themselves.	Se kinne har alles dwaan.
I remember the first time.	Ik wit noch de earste kear.
People want to look at you.	Minsken wolle nei dy sjen.
I could not help it, really	Ik koe it net helpe, echt
I want to have a word or two with you	Ik wol noch in wurd of twa mei dy hawwe
I had to take the day off from school	Ik moast de dei frij nimme fan skoalle
He liked his new self.	Hy mocht graach syn nije sels.
Let's get to that.	Litte wy der oan komme.
She lives here.	Se wennet hjir.
We stay.	Wy bliuwe.
He was such a good guy.	Hy wie sa'n goede keardel.
You will try not to encounter it, but it will stay.	Jo sille besykje it net tsjin te kommen, mar it sil bliuwe.
We'll see it through	Wy sille it troch sjen
But it's not just those things.	Mar it is net allinnich dy dingen.
I knew exactly what was coming	Ik wist krekt wat der komme soe
Now enough about me.	No genôch oer my.
I could not get through	Ik koe der net troch
She could not believe me.	Se koe my net leauwe.
But he was too tired to be angry for long.	Mar hy wie te wurch om lang lilk te wêzen.
I could not take them back	Ik koe se net werom nimme
I can only hope you do too	Ik kin allinnich hoopje dat jo ek dogge
I still had the problem.	Ik hie noch it probleem.
We will look at your life from today.	Wy sille fan hjoed ôf nei jo libben sjen.
I have no idea how he does it	Ik ha gjin idee hoe't hy it docht
Do not think it was easy.	Tink net dat it maklik wie.
Nothing happened at all.	Der barde hielendal neat.
The other, not so much.	De oare, net sa folle.
I should not think of that	Ik soe der net oan tinke moatte
I did know how it felt	Ik wist wol hoe't it fielde
So they want to leave it open.	Sa wolle se it iepen litte.
I'm a new man, and need to make my name.	Ik bin in nije man, en moat myn namme meitsje.
You must.	Do moast.
He does not do the work.	Hy docht it wurk net.
I wish more people did this.	Ik winskje dat mear minsken dit diene.
You can not stop them.	Jo kinne se net ophâlde.
I know this is difficult for you too	Ik wit dat dit ek dreech is foar dy
I have to tell the truth	Ik moat de wierheid fertelle
I was asked about it, all the time	Ik waard der oer frege, de hiele tiid
I had to stop you	Ik moast dy ophâlde
But a few did.	Mar in pear diene.
I think that's a good idea	Ik tink dat der in goed idee
I knew he was worried	Ik wist dat hy soargen wie
I expected him to be ready a long time ago.	Ik ferwachte him al lang earder klear te hawwen.
I tried to speak but could not find the words	Ik besocht te praten, mar koe de wurden net fine
But that's all you get for now.	Mar dat is alles wat jo foar no krije.
Also not too busy.	Ek net te drok.
None of those things happened.	Gjin fan dy dingen barde.
I can give you anything you want	Ik kin jo alles jaan wat jo wolle
I'll talk to her.	Ik sil mei har prate.
I think tomorrow is another day.	Ik tink dat moarn in oare dei is.
Of course, everyone has something to say.	Fansels hat elkenien wat te sizzen.
That was our best chance of not getting sick.	Dat wie ús bêste kâns om net siik te wurden.
Mary comes from that city.	Mary komt út dy stêd.
All too late	Al wat te let
But she could not say it.	Mar se koe it net sizze.
I needed her with me	Ik hie har by my nedich
Here are just a few.	Hjir binne mar in pear.
This was her job.	Dit wie har wurk.
I was told to come here for the day	Ik waard ferteld om hjir foar de dei te kommen
But he had not.	Mar hy hie net.
That's how you are.	Dat is hoe't jo binne.
He was soon angry.	Hy wie gau lilk.
No one sits like that about their past.	Nimmen sit sa oer har ferline.
Are you saying.	Binne jo sizze.
You have done a good job.	Jo hawwe goed wurk dien.
I had to go back home.	Ik moast werom nei hûs.
If he was not too tired.	As er net al te wurch wie.
That, of course, is a good question.	Dat is fansels in goede fraach.
With the latter, no problem.	Mei dat lêste, gjin probleem.
I would not hold myself now	Ik soe my no net hâlde
I'll never leave you like that again	Ik sil dy noait wer sa litte
We do not feel that way.	Wy fine net sa.
But someone did.	Mar immen die.
I love reading, of course	Ik hâld fan lêzen, fansels
I wondered what they were doing.	Ik frege my ôf wat se diene.
I would think she would be	Ik soe tinke dat se soe wêze
She looked so happy.	Se seach der sa bliid út.
I was just glad I still had a job	Ik wie gewoan bliid dat ik noch in baan ha
Not a bad man.	Net in min man.
The same thing happens now.	Itselde bart no.
We both know that.	Dat witte wy beide.
No one was interested in what happened to me.	Nimmen wie ynteressearre yn wat my barde.
I have not told him anything yet	Ik haw him noch neat ferteld
I did not know what it was	Ik wist net wat it wie
Have your life.	Hawwe dyn libben.
He comes to me.	Hy komt by my.
I wanted to talk to you first	Ik woe earst mei dy prate
A woman was just what she needed	In frou wie krekt wat se nedich wie
I did not want to stay here at all	Ik woe hjir hielendal net bliuwe
And he made the song.	En hy makke it liet.
They then go out to eat	Se geane dan út iten
I feel like we are almost one	Ik fiel dat wy hast ien binne
I have to work.	Ik moat wurkje.
No one was ever good enough for her.	Nimmen wie oait goed genôch foar har.
I have to tell her the truth	Ik moat har de wierheid fertelle
Still, go on.	Noch, gean troch.
We'll have to do something with you.	Wy sille wat mei dy dwaan moatte.
My parents had no idea.	Myn âlden hiene gjin idee.
She knew it would not be easy.	Se wist dat it net maklik wurde soe.
Children, pay attention.	Bern, let op.
I did the work.	Ik die it wurk.
I should never have met you	Ik hie dy nea moete moatten
And now we know there is a better way.	En no witte wy dat der in bettere manier is.
They knew we were coming.	Se wisten dat wy komme.
I know things can get better than this	Ik wit dat dingen better kinne as dit
He went back to his work.	Hy gie werom nei syn wurk.
I believe in everyone here.	Ik leau yn elkenien hjir.
She knew right away that she had to live there.	Se wist fuort dat se dêr wenje moast.
Well, things are different.	No, dingen binne oars.
The truth is told.	De wierheid wurdt ferteld.
I have some help for you.	Ik haw dy wat help.
I hope they find what they need in their lives.	Ik hoopje dat se fine wat se nedich hawwe yn har libben.
I had seen them here before	Ik hie se hjir al earder sjoen
I had more than one room	Ik hie mear as ien keamer
I could not believe it was him	Ik koe net leauwe dat it him wie
But there it was, for both of us.	Mar dêr wie it, foar ús beide.
I know where we're going	Ik wit wêr't wy hinne geane
Probably they would never know.	Wierskynlik soene se it noait witte.
I was just trying to see what you said	Ik besocht gewoan te sjen wat dy sei
But it had not happened.	Mar it wie net bard.
I was not happy about this.	Ik wie net bliid oer dit.
I would never have told anyone you knew	Ik soe nea hawwe ferteld immen jo wist
Well, not so much.	No, net sa folle.
You play this.	Jo spylje dit.
It will always be there	It sil der altyd wêze
And this faith did not even come from you.	En dit leauwe kaam net iens fan dy.
I'm not trying to look at him	Ik besykje net nei him te sjen
I never know what he will do	Ik wit noait wat er dwaan sil
Well, he must be.	No, hy moat wêze.
The time is ready.	De tiid is klear.
I could look at that all day	Dêr koe ik de hiele dei nei sjen
And it makes me sad.	En it makket my dreech.
Your father is gone now and we are the family.	Jo heit is no fuort en wy binne de famylje.
I'm a big fan since day one	Ik bin sûnt dei ien in grutte fan
I realized what you realized	Ik realisearre wat jo realisearre
She came into her house.	Se kaam yn har hûs.
I'm sure he can help you	Ik bin der wis fan dat hy jo kin helpe
I did not even really know why	Ik wist net iens echt wêrom
She would think he wanted her to come back.	Se soe tinke dat er woe dat se werom kaam.
I know where you live	Ik wit wêr't jo wenje
I bought it, well, to show it off	Ik kocht it oan, goed, om it te sjen litte
I really wanted to know	Ik woe echt witte
But she does get over it.	Mar se komt der wol oer.
Well, this is the same thing.	No, dit is itselde ding.
I do not know why it is in the picture.	Ik wit net wêrom't it op 'e foto stiet.
That was good in a way.	Dat wie op in manier goed.
There is something more.	Der is wat mear.
I had no money	Ik hie gjin jild
I do not know for sure.	Ik wit it net wis.
I know you'll be angry	Ik wit dat jo lilk wurde
This is a good place.	Dit is in goed plak.
I did not feel that way	Ik fielde my net sa
You will have a few friends.	Jo sille in pear freonen hawwe.
He is not the first and will not be the last.	Hy is net de earste en sil net de lêste wêze.
I believe we can get this done	Ik leau dat wy dit dien kinne krije
However, it does not matter now.	Hoe dan ek, it makket no neat út.
So it worked.	Sa wurke it.
They are not happy.	Se binne net bliid.
I did not want anyone to see me like that	Ik woe net dat ien my sa seach
I've seen you, maybe too clearly	Ik haw dy sjoen, miskien te dúdlik
It's getting old, man.	It wurdt âld, man.
She will not tell me why she is here.	Se sil my net fertelle wêrom't se hjir is.
I did not think you were interested	Ik tocht net dat jo ynteressearre wiene
I need to ask you something.	Ik moat dy wat freegje.
Well, no problem.	No, gjin probleem.
I see her twice a year	Ik sjoch har twa kear yn it jier
Though that is not the problem.	Al is dat net it probleem.
I will not be in this house again	Ik sil net wer yn dit hûs wêze
The truth is not enough.	De wierheid is net genôch.
We get.	Wy krije.
I like you very much	Ik wol dy tige min
I do have one question though	Ik haw wol ien fraach
I watched a lot of movies.	Ik seach in protte film.
I did not want him at all	Ik woe him hielendal net
Even when she knew he was going to hurt me.	Sels doe't se wist dat hy my sear dwaan soe.
She said it too.	Se sei it ek.
I can not wait to read much more from you.	Ik kin net wachtsje om folle mear fan jo te lêzen.
I would of course do it differently	Ik soe it fansels oars dwaan
He was not sure why.	Hy wie net wis wêrom.
I will not tell him anything	Ik sil him neat sizze
I was sure the person was a woman	Ik wie der wis fan dat de persoan wie in frou
I had a lot of questions	Ik hie in protte fragen
I have no idea what to do	Ik haw gjin idee wat te dwaan
Not in the past.	Net yn it ferline.
I got too tired to finish it	Ik waard te wurch om it ôf te meitsjen
I just took a chance.	Ik naam gewoan in kâns.
I can not believe it	Ik kin it my net leauwe litte
I want to know your thoughts	Ik wol jo gedachten witte
I see you've found everything	Ik sjoch dat jo alles fûn hawwe
I would love to have one like that	Ik soe graach hawwe in sa'n
I'll have to ask my husband.	Ik sil myn man freegje moatte.
She knew what had happened.	Se wist wat der bard wie.
I can not wait to get you alone	Ik kin net wachtsje om dy allinnich te krijen
We are your new best friends.	Wy binne jo nije bêste freonen.
I heard or saw no one	Ik hearde of seach gjinien
But, they did not ask me.	Mar, se hawwe my net frege.
That is the last word.	Dat is it lêste wurd.
It should have been.	It hie wêze moatten.
I'm not sure.	Ik bin der net wis fan.
Well made.	Goed makke.
They will never work.	Se sille noait wurkje.
I wore exactly the same thing	Ik hie krekt itselde ding oan
I just do not know what you say you know.	Ik wit gewoan net wat jo sizze dat jo witte.
But he was ready.	Mar hy wie klear.
I want to see my friends.	Ik wol myn freonen sjen.
I always wanted to be like my father.	Ik woe altyd wêze as myn heit.
And, in a way, it had.	En, op in manier, hie it.
Such a beautiful child too.	Sa'n moai bern ek.
I did not find it until yesterday	Ik fûn it net oant juster
I could not really say it	Ik koe it eins net sizze
But we do know.	Mar wy witte wol.
I think everyone knows	Ik tink dat elkenien wit
I was working on it.	Ik wurke der oan.
I used to have a lot of this	Ik hie eartiids in protte fan dit
I was pretty busy ready	Ik wie aardich drok klear
I have not met her family	Ik haw har famylje net moete
But it's going well, believe me.	Mar it komt goed, leau my.
I handed it back, waiting for him to leave	Ik joech it werom, wachte op him om te gean
I worked so hard to get here.	Ik wurke sa hurd om hjir te kommen.
I really liked this guy	Ik mocht echt fan dizze jonge
But it's good that you're with him today.	Mar it is goed dat jo hjoed by him binne.
I've never done it and regret it to this day	Ik haw it noait dien en spyt it oant hjoed de dei
I would love to be there too	Ik soe der ek wol by wêze
It was really a problem.	It wie echt in probleem.
Going to him was very different.	Nei him ta gean wie hiel wat oars.
Your life is too busy.	Jo libben is te drok.
he asked him.	frege er him ôf.
You will see me again.	Jo sille my wer sjen.
I just knew there was something wrong	Ik wist gewoan dat d'r wat oan wie
You've never met her before.	Jo hawwe har noch noait moete.
I got away right away.	Ik kaam fuort fuort.
I got the other one.	Ik krige de oare.
I saw what happened.	Ik seach wat der barde.
This has worked.	Dit hat wurke.
It's beautiful.	It is moai.
A very bad thing.	In hiel min ding.
We have to get out of here.	Wy moatte hjir wei.
Be sure and look at me.	Wês wis en sjoch nei my.
Also, we should worry about him.	Ek soene wy ​​om him soargen meitsje moatte.
But life is what you make.	Mar it libben is wat jo meitsje.
I love you just for that reason	Ik hâld fan dy krekt om dy reden
The old man there.	De âld man dêr.
Maybe he loved my mother even more now.	Miskien hat er no sels mear fan myn mem hâlden.
I have to go now, work you know	Ik moat no gean, wurkje jo witte
The people come and go.	De minsken komme en geane.
Let a be.	Lit in wêze.
I love you always and forever	Ik hâld fan dy altyd en foar altyd
But that was nice.	Mar dat wie moai.
And there is nothing to do.	En der hoecht neat te dwaan.
I think she expected them too.	Ik tink dat se ferwachte se te.
For anyone from here on out.	Foar immen fan hjir ôf.
I did not want to talk to him	Ik woe net mei him prate
I'm fine now.	It giet my no goed.
I wish it was over	Ik woe dat it oer wie
He liked it too.	Hy like it ek wol.
It's yours now.	It is no fan dy.
I was never good at this	Ik wie nea goed yn dit
I still have something to read.	Ik haw noch wat te lêzen.
This is who you are now.	Dit is wa't jo no binne.
This is how it works.	Dit is hoe't it wurket.
In the open.	Yn 'e iepen.
I did not want to see him.	Ik woe him net sjen.
When you think you felt something, you felt it.	As jo ​​tinke dat jo wat fielde, dan fielde jo it.
He, too, had presumably been at the party.	Ek hy hie nei alle gedachten op it feest west.
I knew why he did that	Ik wist wêrom hy dat dien hie
I'm also interested in why	Ik bin ek ynteressearre yn wêrom
But not everyone wants to live in a city.	Mar net elkenien wol yn in stêd wenje.
That's what the city does to you.	Dat docht de stêd mei dy.
She had seen that before.	Dat hie se ek earder sjoen.
I would not wish that on any other woman	Dat soe ik gjin oare frou winskje
But who else.	Mar wa oars.
In fact, that was not true.	Eins wie dat net wier.
She was good.	Se wie goed.
And he did not want to do that.	En dat woe er net dwaan.
I did what was necessary	Ik die wat nedich wie
And there you have found the best.	En dêr hawwe jo de bêste fûn.
I could not say why, exactly.	Ik koe net sizze wêrom, krekt.
I liked it just fine.	Ik fûn it krekt goed.
Last night we had a bit of both.	Jûn hiene wy ​​in bytsje fan beide.
So much happened that year.	Der barde safolle yn dat jier.
If so, these questions are for you.	As dat sa is, binne dizze fragen wis foar jo.
Sure, they would not tell him.	Wis, se soene it him net fertelle.
I could not let it happen	Ik koe it net barre litte
I hope it's okay with her	Ik hoopje dat it goed is mei har
I did not do it today	Ik haw it hjoed net dien
I thought she was just another woman	Ik tocht dat se gewoan in oare frou wie
We will never know.	Wy sille it noait witte.
I just wanted to show it to you	Ik woe it dy mar sjen litte
I think you never know	Ik tink dat jo it noait witte
I had no idea what it was talking about	Ik hie gjin idee wêr't it oer praat
I did not wait for him or even look back	Ik wachte net op him of seach sels net werom
This is the same in life.	Dit is itselde yn it libben.
Clearly she was wrong.	Dúdlik wie se ferkeard.
They were both good at it.	Se wiene der beide goed yn.
I have to do something very different	Ik moat hiel oars dwaan
We are more than that.	Wy binne mear as dat.
I had no food with me	Ik hie gjin iten mei
Not today, not tomorrow, new week or next month.	Net hjoed, net moarn, nije wike of oare moanne.
Here was trouble.	Hjir wie problemen.
I need your people on the water	Ik haw jo minsken nedich op it wetter
I gave him some money	Ik joech him wat jild
I did not know she had one	Ik wist net dat se ien hie
He would not say.	Hy soe net sizze.
That's a really good question.	Dat is in echt goede fraach.
I had to go back home	Ik moast werom nei hûs
I thought he was too careful	Ik tocht dat er te foarsichtich wie
I always went home alone	Ik gie altyd allinnich nei hûs
And he the.	En hy die.
I just was not in it	Ik wie der gewoan net yn
I have other things to do for you	Ik haw oare dingen foar jo te dwaan
I want to look around me first	Ik wol earst om my hinne sjen
He could do many things for her.	Hy koe har in protte dingen dwaan.
It was a job.	It wie in baan.
I could see he was seeing us	Ik koe sjen dat er ús seach
They were wrong.	Se wiene ferkeard.
It's bad for everyone.	It is min foar elkenien.
It's me.	It bin ik.
It really bothers me.	It makket my echt oan.
It was clearly wrong.	It wie dúdlik ferkeard.
He's the big guy.	Hy is de grutte keardel.
There you will find us.	Dêr fine jo ús.
I know what's going on here	Ik wit wat hjir bart
And now it has happened.	En no is it bard.
I still have a lot to do.	Ik haw noch folle te dwaan.
I had nothing to do with the questions	Ik hie neat oan de fragen
We do not know.	Wy witte it net.
I was hard again, though	Ik waard wer hurd, al
Just a little .	Mar in bytsje .
I also have no idea what to do	Ik ha ek gjin idee wat te dwaan
This they said.	Dit hawwe sein.
She does not want to go through with it again.	Se wol der net wer troch.
I just wanted to help	Ik woe gewoan helpe
I did not want to see him like that.	Ik woe him net sa sjen.
I assume it's real	Ik nim oan dat it it echt is
Even more than that.	Noch mear as dat.
You would like him.	Jo soene him graach wolle.
I would like nothing more	Ik soe graach neat mear
You are free to come and go as you please.	Jo binne frij om te kommen en gean as jo wolle.
I need to get her back	Ik moat har werom krije
It's really fun for me.	It is echt leuk foar my.
Or in the bus.	Of yn 'e bus.
I can not have this in my house	Ik kin dit net yn myn hûs ha
I did not tell him this, of course	Ik haw him dit fansels net ferteld
He was good.	Hy wie goed.
She told her everything.	Se fertelde har alles.
Here's the problem.	Hjir is it probleem.
Or so he thought it was his time.	Of sa tocht er dat it syn tiid wie.
I'm not that person	Ik bin net dy persoan
I will make the best of it.	Ik sil der it bêste fan meitsje.
Makes that family, too.	Makket dy famylje, te.
I did not get back in there	Ik kaam der net werom yn
I have another way	Ik haw in oare manier
I really should not say this.	Ik soe dit echt net moatte sizze.
Everything you believe is wrong.	Alles wat jo leauwe is ferkeard.
I really like this book.	Ik hâld echt fan dit boek.
I liked him for that.	Dêr mocht ik him foar.
I always wanted to come from a big family	Ik woe altyd út in grutte famylje komme
If you find anything, be sure to let us know.	As jo ​​​​wat fine, wês wis dat jo ús witte litte.
I had no idea what to do	Ik hie gjin idee wat te dwaan
We do not keep up.	Wy hâlde net by.
She does not want you.	Se wol dy net.
Heard nothing else said.	Neat oars sizzen heard.
I should be wrong	Ik soe ferkeard wêze moatten
I found nothing wrong	Ik fûn neat ferkeard
Do not talk at first.	Earst net prate.
Please help me.	Help my asjebleaft.
And no one goes to bed.	En nimmen giet op bêd.
I love both	Ik hâld fan beide
She has never done anything bad to anyone.	Se hat noait wat min oan ien dien.
There was nothing left of her here.	Hjir wie der neat fan har oer.
I can not get it among the others.	Ik kin it net ûnder de oare krije.
A woman who was there told me	In frou dy't der wie fertelde my
We really need this child.	Wy hawwe dit bern echt nedich.
I worked hard this year	Ik wurke hurd dit jier
I just know it can be done	Ik wit gewoan dat it kin dien wurde
I'm not sure what to do or say	Ik bin der net wis fan wat te dwaan of te sizzen
I should be happy now.	Ik soe no bliid wêze moatte.
And now he's in jail again.	En no sit er wer yn de finzenis.
They are not his children.	It binne syn bern net.
He has his friends, but, well, it's not the same.	Hy hat syn freonen, mar, no, it is net itselde.
I had never seen her like this before	Ik hie har noch noait sa sjoen
More is coming soon.	Der komt gau mear.
I should have been happy	Ik hie bliid wêze moatten
He wants to become something.	Hy wol wat wurde.
I was not ready yet an hour ago	Ik wie noch gjin oere lyn klear
I looked, wondering what they were doing	Ik seach, frege my ôf wat se diene
He was just not among them.	Hy wie gewoan net ûnder har.
She did not know what to think of him.	Se wist net wat se fan him tinke moast.
I will not let you stay home	Ik lit dy net thús bliuwe
We're just getting everything ready today.	Wy meitsje hjoed gewoan alles klear.
Also not so good.	Ek net sa goed.
He did not begin to speak at once.	Hy begûn net yn ien kear te praten.
I had seen them together.	Ik hie se tegearre sjoen.
She knew exactly what she wanted	Se wist krekt wat se woe
But that's the net.	Mar dat die se net.
It's long.	It is lang.
I did not like much of it	Ik mocht der net folle fan
He's in your class.	Hy is yn jo klasse.
I know you will not believe me	Ik wit dat jo my net leauwe sille
I'm not sure how we'll do this.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe't wy dit sille dwaan.
I am in you and you are in me	Ik bin yn dy en do bist yn my
And so the police just walked away from the place.	En sa rûn de plysje gewoan fan it plak ôf.
It was the first time he had ever shown it.	It wie de earste kear dat er it oait sjen liet.
That will not happen in this.	Dat sil yn dizze net barre.
You will not have any problems now.	Jo sille no gjin problemen hawwe.
I have to ask you the following	Ik moat jo it folgjende freegje
They do it all.	Se dogge it allegear.
It's good to see you.	It is goed om dy te sjen.
Look for it this week or next.	Sjoch foar it dizze wike of folgjende.
Or maybe she did not know it the same way.	Of miskien wist se it net op deselde manier.
I went back in time.	Ik gie werom yn de tiid.
So is her husband.	Sa is har man.
She was there all day.	Se wie der de hiele dei.
That never happened again.	Dat is nea wer bard.
He had no children	Hy hie gjin bern
It just says itself.	It seit himsels gewoan.
I would buy them again	Ik soe keapje se wer
She asked who was there.	Se frege wa't der wie.
And that's the big problem.	En dat is it grutte probleem.
I think you are who you are	Ik tink dat jo binne wa't jo binne
Think about your question.	Tink oer jo fraach.
You've been away a lot.	Do bist in protte fuort west.
He could not be himself.	Hy koe himsels net wêze.
You will stay right here.	Jo sille hjir krekt bliuwe.
And so it began.	En sa begûn it.
It was just not done.	It wie gewoan net dien.
A few years ago he would not have asked	In pear jier lyn soe er net frege hawwe
There is no way to fix this.	D'r is gjin manier om dit goed te meitsjen.
I'll know if he did it or not	Ik sil witte oft hy it dien hat of net
But of course there was one in the house.	Mar der wie fansels ien yn 'e hûs.
I did this and it works.	Ik die dit en it wurket.
I think we need three of us	Ik tink dat wy trije fan ús nedich binne
There had been a name.	Der hie in namme west.
No one would do that.	Nimmen soe dat dwaan.
What you say goes.	Wat jo sizze giet.
They had only tried it once before.	Se hiene it mar ien kear earder besocht.
Of course, it would still have to come to his work.	Fansels, it soe noch oan syn wurk komme moatte.
He needed her to need him.	Hy hie it nedich dat se him nedich hie.
Or if there is, tell me what it is.	Of as der is, fertel my wat it is.
Whether they like it or not	Oft se it leuk fine of net
Well, it is not.	No, it is net.
I can not go back now	Ik kin no net werom
He came over.	Hy kaam oer.
I love you very much	Ik hâld tige fan dy
I had no idea how to do it	Ik hie gjin idee hoe't ik it dwaan moast
It's such beautiful hair.	It is sa moai hier.
It's going very badly.	It giet hiel min.
If anything happened to you.	As der wat bard mei dy.
I'm sorry it has to be done.	It spyt my dat it dien wurde moat.
I went back to work.	Ik gie wer oan it wurk.
I think what we are going to do is this	Ik tink dat wat wy sille dwaan is dit
I hope to see you at dinner	Ik hoopje dy te sjen by it iten
I had to do it that way	Ik moast it sa dwaan
You are among friends here.	Jo binne ûnder freonen hjir.
I had none more	Ik hie gjinien mear
I was very scared to say it	Ik wie tige bang om it te sizzen
We do not do that.	Dat dogge wy net.
I know it will be soon	Ik wit dat it gau sil wêze
I had nothing to do with having friends	Ik hie der neat om freonen te hawwen
I hope you like this place	Ik hoopje dat jo dit plak leuk fine
I wish it had not happened	Ik woe dat it net bard wie
I've never heard of anyone having that problem.	Ik haw noch noait heard fan ien dy't dat probleem hat.
You are going to do what you do well.	Jo geane dwaan wat jo goed dogge.
I'm not the only one surprised by this	Ik bin net de iennichste ferrast troch dit
This is not the first time this has happened.	It is net de earste kear dat dit barde.
It keeps me going.	It hâldt my troch.
They are hard to get off.	Se binne dreech om ôf te kommen.
But let's try and make this work.	Mar lit ús besykje en meitsje dizze wurk.
I've been having this problem lately	Ik haw dit probleem de lêste tiid
But that has to wait until tomorrow, he thought.	Mar dat moat oant moarn wachtsje, tocht er.
I know you're scared.	Ik wit dat jo bang binne.
Go and do your work.	Gean en doch dyn wurk.
It's a whole picture.	It is in hiele foto.
I can not go through this again	Ik kin dit net wer troch
It was talked about all the time.	Der waard de hiele tiid oer praat.
I had nothing to do with staying home	Ik hie der neat oan om thús te bliuwen
Be so.	Wês sa.
I knew she did not want to hurt me	Ik wist dat se my net sear dwaan woe
He does not come without her.	Hy komt net sûnder har.
He thought about it.	Hy tocht der oer.
She does not tell me anymore.	Se fertelle my net mear.
And that someone is us.	En dat immen is ús.
I want to believe him	Ik wol him leauwe
Almost sure of his mother.	Hast wis fan syn mem.
Anyone can help me.	Elkenien kin my helpe.
I had absolutely nothing to do with it	Ik hie der hielendal neat oan
I did not want to wait a week to see you	Ik woe net in wike wachtsje om dy te sjen
People talk about it.	Minsken prate der oer.
I think she did something to his car	Ik tink dat se wat oan syn auto dien hat
I sat down again.	Ik siet wer.
I tried the same things you did	Ik besocht deselde dingen dy't jo dien hawwe
I can do things for you	Ik kin dingen foar dy dwaan
I hope it goes well with you.	Ik hoopje dat it goed giet mei dy.
I've already told you.	Ik haw it dy al ferteld.
I will never know what it was.	Ik sil noait witte wat it wie.
I would say a few months	Ik soe sizze in pear moanne
Try to make things happen.	Besykje te meitsjen fan dingen.
We always will.	Wy sille altyd.
We set.	Wy sette.
Here is what you have.	Hjir is wat jo hawwe.
I did not really know.	Ik wist it eins net.
And it was not like my hair.	En it wie net as myn hier.
I have a husband.	Ik haw in man.
Now everyone has done so many other things	No hat elkenien safolle oare dingen dien
We talked about it for hours and hours.	Wy hawwe it der oeren en oeren oer hân.
But, a reason.	Mar, in reden.
She wanted it that way.	Se woe it sa.
It works for very few.	It wurket foar hiel pear.
Almost everyone there.	Hast elkenien dêr.
I really believe it's coming.	Ik leau echt dat it komt.
I did not know how to deal with it	Ik wist net hoe ik der mei oan moast
These things really happen	Dizze dingen barre echt
I have to do it myself	Ik moat it sels dwaan
There was nothing for her home.	Der wie neat foar har thús.
See what he says, and talk it through.	Sjoch wat er seit, en praat it troch.
I did not have them for long, but a few years	Ik hie se net lang, mar in pear jier
But please, do not give me away.	Mar asjebleaft, jou my asjebleaft net ôf.
And you can not have it.	En jo kinne it net hawwe.
I'm really sorry	Dat spyt my echt
My thoughts, and worries, too.	Myn gedachten, en soargen, ek.
Better care.	Better soargje.
Not sure if it will help you though.	Net wis oft it sil helpe jo al.
He was a nice man.	Hy wie in aardich man.
It should be enough.	It moat genôch wêze.
He might not know it.	Hy mocht it net witte.
I know you know that	Ik wit dat jo dat witte
I never had to ask twice	Ik moast noait twa kear freegje
I had to be that something	Ik moast dat wat wêze
That you were not good enough for them now.	Dat jo no net goed genôch foar har wiene.
I can 't leave it to you myself.	Ik kin dy it sels net litte.
But at that time.	Mar yn dy tiid.
I think you will be happy	Ik tink dat jo bliid wêze sille
His was also a bit of a problem.	Syn wie ek in bytsje in probleem.
I have not thought about it for a long time.	Ik ha der lang net oan tocht.
I think it would be fun	Ik tink dat it leuk wêze soe
It does not happen.	It bart net.
And you want to know what will happen then.	En jo wolle witte wat der dan barre sil.
I love him and he loves me	Ik hâld fan him en hy hâldt fan my
I have to go to school first	Ik moat earst nei skoalle
I think you have a problem.	Ik tink dat jo in probleem hawwe.
You've seen it too.	Jo hawwe it ek sjoen.
He does not like you.	Hy hâldt net fan dy.
Next time we will do this.	De folgjende kear sille wy dit dwaan.
She looked around.	Se seach om har hinne.
I wondered what was going on	Ik frege my ôf wat der oan de hân wie
But it was not up to me.	Mar it wie net oan my.
I need to think about what you said	Ik moat tinke oer wat jo seine
I hope you enjoy this book	Ik hope dat jo dit boek leuk fine
That's more of the same.	Dat is mear fan itselde.
I like to think of it that way	Ik tink der graach sa oan
But it's true.	Mar it is wier.
Just tell me.	Fertel it my gewoan.
I knew all too well how that felt	Ik wist al te goed hoe't dat fielde
A home away from home.	In thús fuort fan hûs.
And maybe it still can.	En miskien kin it noch.
I think she's having problems.	Ik tink dat se problemen hat.
Anyone could do them.	Elkenien koe se dwaan.
I saw the whole thing.	Ik seach it hiele ding.
He can never know.	Hy kin it noait witte.
I could leave it in the car	Ik koe it yn 'e auto litte
It is either they or do without.	It is of se of dwaan sûnder.
I showed them bad for their friends	Ik liet se min sjen foar har freonen
See other people happy too.	Ek oare minsken bliid sjen.
A week ago, she did not know where he was	In wike lyn wist se net wêr't er wie
I try to stay away from both	Ik besykje fan beide ôf te bliuwen
It's good or bad.	It is goed of ferkeard.
I see where you're coming from	Ik sjoch wêr't jo komme
We can not find them.	Wy kinne har net fine.
I liked him for that.	Ik mocht him der foar.
I have to tell her everything	Ik moat har alles fertelle
It was really happening.	It wie echt bart.
I've never been, not really	Ik ha noait west, net echt
I still know very well	Ik wit noch hiel goed
I did not know he was back	Ik wist net dat er werom wie
I'm waiting for the past.	Ik wachtsje op it ferline.
I have no problem with that at all.	Ik nim dêr hielendal gjin probleem mei.
I will never go to anyone else	Ik sil nea nei immen oars gean
I have a really hard time dealing with it	Ik haw it echt dreech om te gean mei it
We both knew the truth.	Wy wisten beide de wierheid.
I really need to get home.	Ik moat echt thús komme.
This weekend with you.	Dit wykein by jo.
I'll not do that again	Ik doch dat net wer
His words, not mine.	Syn wurden, net myn.
I think her mother told her he was in jail	Ik tink dat har mem har ferteld hat dat hy yn 'e finzenis sit
There is good, and there is bad.	Der is goed, en der is min.
Nothing of the sort happened.	Neat fan it soarte barde.
I do it.	Ik doch it.
But this is so difficult.	Mar dit is sa dreech.
But it felt good to do something.	Mar it fielde goed om wat te dwaan.
I had not thought of them	Ik hie se net tocht
But, he would not.	Mar, hy soe net.
I needed to find a teacher to help me	Ik moast in learaar fine om my te helpen
I wish you were here with me	Ik winskje dat jo hjir by my wiene
I would have done that.	Dat soe ik dien hawwe.
One of the best, they say.	Ien fan de bêste, sizze se.
And this one.	En dizze.
I actually did not expect that	Dat hie ik eins net ferwachte
And now it's gone.	En no is it fuort.
I will definitely visit you every now and then	Ik sil jo wis sa no en dan besykje
I did not really know what to do	Ik wist net echt wat ik dwaan moast
I was out there for a long time.	Ik wie der lang út.
He had never seen that before.	Dat hie er noch nea earder sjoen.
I'm coming out tomorrow.	Ik kom der moarn op út.
He could find nothing.	Hy koe neat fine.
I think this was made by a woman	Ik tink dat dit is makke troch in frou
It's all about money now.	It giet no allinnich oer jild.
I could help you	Ik koe jo helpe
For a bit.	Foar in bytsje.
She would never tell you how good she is.	Se soe jo noait fertelle hoe goed se is.
I know they get me	Ik wit dat se my krije
I wanted them at home too.	Ik woe se ek thús.
I always did not feel in place	Ik fielde my altyd net plak
These are for you.	Dizze binne foar jo.
He is a man of his word.	Hy is in man fan syn wurd.
I did not expect anything	Ik hie neat ferwachte
It happened often.	It barde faak.
I did not want to take much of your time	Ik woe net folle fan jo tiid nimme
I just wanted to say nothing	Ik woe gewoan neat sizze
I want it back.	Ik wol it werom.
We were surprised by it.	Wy wiene der ferrast troch.
I now regret what I said	Ik spyt no wat ik sei
There was really nothing to do.	Der wie eins neat te dwaan.
He could not help it.	Hy koe it net helpe.
I did it just a week ago	Ik die it krekt in wike lyn
There was too little time.	Der wie te min tiid.
So will her mother.	Dat sil har mem ek.
She's coming home soon.	Se komt gau thús.
But that was just such a man.	Mar dat wie krekt sa'n man.
I need to see her again	Ik moat har wer sjen
I know you've heard it before	Ik wit dat jo it earder heard hawwe
All of them.	Elkenien.
I need to know exactly where he is	Ik moat krekt witte wêr't er is
Please, let it go.	Asjebleaft, lit it gean.
I told her what had happened to me	Ik fertelde har wat der mei my bard wie
I would go with the wool	Ik soe gean mei de wol
But no one would know about it.	Mar nimmen soe der fan witte.
I should have told you	Ik hie it dy sizze moatten
I had never seen her before	Ik hie har noch noait earder sjoen
It's hard to get away from.	It is dreech om fuort te kommen.
I had it for some reason to say that to her	Ik hie it om ien of oare reden om dat tsjin har te sizzen
But not much help.	Mar net folle help.
Everyone looked to see what was going on.	Elkenien seach om te sjen wat der oan de hân wie.
We never agreed.	Wy wiene it noait iens.
I'm trying to find someone to go with me.	Ik besykje immen te finen om mei my te gean.
I can not look at anyone	Ik kin net nei ien sjen
I did not like that he knew where everything was	Ik mocht net graach dat er wist wêr't alles wie
I can see know has yet	Ik kin sjen witte hat noch
Have some friends over tonight.	Hawwe wat freonen oer fannacht.
Got me some time.	Hat my in tiid.
They are not wrong.	Se binne net ferkeard.
You will love this one.	Jo sille dizze leuk fine.
I can see why you did it	Ik kin sjen wêrom jo dien it
I know this has not been easy for you	Ik wit dat dit net maklik foar jo west hat
I'm a dog.	Ik bin in hûn.
No one could see me.	Nimmen koe my sjen.
Many went.	In protte gien.
Here is one way.	Hjir is ien manier.
I can do this with you all day	Ik kin dit de hiele dei mei dy dwaan
I would argue that it is more than enough	Ik soe hâlde dat it mear as genôch is
I should say something	Ik soe wat sizze moatte
I thought he loved you	Ik tocht dat er fan dy hâlde
I could be in one of them	Ik koe yn ien fan har wêze
I found the problem.	Ik fûn it probleem.
About what you can become.	Oer wat jo wurde kinne.
I will never go through with it again	Ik sil der noait wer troch gean
I hope your weekend goes well	Ik hoopje dat dyn wykein goed giet
I did not want to talk	Ik woe net prate
You find where you are.	Jo fine wêr't jo binne.
This is exactly what is happening here.	Dit is krekt wat hjir bart.
First, the good.	Earst, it goede.
He liked to see his husband work.	Hy mocht graach sjen dat syn man wurke.
I needed other people around me	Ik hie oare minsken om my hinne nedich
It does not matter whether we have seen them or not.	It makket net út oft wy se sjoen hawwe of net.
I've never had that before.	Dat haw ik noch noait earder hân.
I'm talking about something very different.	Ik haw it oer wat hiel oars.
But he could not stay forever.	Mar hy koe net foar altyd bliuwe.
I was glad he still lived there	Ik wie bliid dat er dêr noch wenne
I had to get away from this life	Ik moast fuort fan dit libben
Or you can ask them here.	Of jo kinne se hjir freegje.
I know you will have many questions	Ik wit dat jo in protte fragen sille hawwe
Everyone had to have a pair.	Elkenien moast in pear hawwe.
He said he would go, but he never went.	Hy sei dat er gean soe, mar hy gie noait.
I think she was ready to go up with us.	Ik tink dat se ree wie om mei ús op te gean.
I wondered how it was with my family	Ik frege my ôf hoe't it mei myn famylje die
I needed to know more about him	Ik moast mear oer him witte
He had no idea what was happening.	Hy hie gjin idee wat der barde.
It was all different.	It wie allegear oars.
They do it very well at home.	Se dogge it tige goed thús.
I'll never know if that happened	Ik sil noait witte oft it sa bard is
And he must have it back, of course.	En hy moat it fansels werom ha.
I knew that would not happen	Ik wist dat dat net barre soe
They do it.	Se dogge it.
We would be much better off if we did.	Wy soene folle better ôf wêze as wy dat dogge.
I knew there was something to everything lately	Ik wist dat der de lêste tiid wat oan alles wie
I could not believe it, after all her work	Ik koe it net leauwe, nei al har wurk
We can do that.	Dat kinne wy ​​dwaan.
That's not my problem.	Dat is myn probleem net.
I ate well	Ik haw goed iten
I was actually good at that	Dêr wie ik eins goed yn
It worked well for her.	It wurke goed foar har.
I'm sure there have been some problems	Ik bin der wis fan dat d'r wat problemen west hawwe
I put it off long enough	Ik sette it lang genôch út
Why would they do that? 	Wêrom soene se dat dwaan?
he asked.	hy frege.
I had never met her before.	Ik hie har nea earder moete.
I want to show why not.	Ik wol sjen litte wêrom net.
I'll show you what's going on	Ik sil dy sjen litte wat der bart
I will not do it.	Ik sil it net dwaan.
I have to try this on her bed	Ik moat dit op har bêd besykje
I can not seem to figure out how to do it.	Ik kin net lykje út te finen hoe't it moat.
As if he knew something that no one else did.	As wist er wat dat nimmen oars die.
They do that so often.	Dat dogge se sa faak.
I will be everything to you	Ik sil alles foar dy wêze
I told him to take it back	Ik fertelde him om it werom te nimmen
He would get so angry.	Hy soe sa lilk wurde.
But he was family.	Mar hy wie famylje.
He shook the child's hand.	Hy joech it bern de hân oan.
Kids know this.	Bern witte dit.
Children were happy.	Bern wiene bliid.
I did not think well	Ik tocht net goed
But that's exactly the problem.	Mar dat is krekt it probleem.
It's different now.	It is no oars.
But no one came to the door.	Mar der kaam net ien by de doar.
Of course he did.	Dat die er fansels.
It seems to be going well.	It liket goed te gean.
I was not sure he was even awake	Ik wie der net wis fan dat er sels wekker wie
I went on.	Ik gie troch.
No words would come.	Gjin wurden soene komme.
To talk things out.	Om dingen út te praten.
They can be an hour away.	Se kinne in oere fuort wêze.
That's all something.	Dat is allegear wat.
He needs to stop.	Hy moat ophâlde.
I did not know that there was so much to it	Ik wist net dat der safolle oan siet
We are all good.	Wy binne allegear goed.
His work was no better.	Syn wurk wie net better.
I did not know what else to do or say	Ik wist net wat ik oars dwaan moast of sizze
I always thought they would make a good pair	Ik tocht altyd dat se in goed pear meitsje soene
She's heard him do it so often enough.	Se hat him sa faak genôch dwaan heard.
She does not like that.	Dat liket har net.
Bad people can do good things.	Minne minsken kinne goede dingen dwaan.
He likes himself.	Hy liket himsels.
I will see again.	Ik sil wer sjen.
We need to do this together.	Wy moatte dit tegearre dwaan.
There was none.	Der wie gjinien.
She needed another, better reason.	Se hie in oare, bettere reden nedich.
If not, continue.	As net, gean troch.
Nobody would want that.	Nimmen soe dat wolle.
Must do everything myself.	Moat alles sels dwaan.
I did not try it, but it happened	Ik besocht it net, mar it barde
I do not feel so sick.	Ik fiel my net sa siik.
Maybe he's doing his job now.	Miskien docht er no syn wurk.
They will regret their words.	Se sille spyt hawwe fan har wurden.
We were busy.	Wy wiene drok.
But that's the problem.	Mar dat is it probleem.
It has problems.	It hat problemen.
I opened it.	Ik die iepen.
I was still too angry	Ik wie noch te lilk
A few friends of mine are there.	In pear freonen fan my binne der.
And somehow we did it.	En op ien of oare manier diene wy ​​it.
He wanted to be the best he could be.	Hy woe it bêste wêze dat er wêze koe.
I did not think it was me	Ik tocht net dat it my wie
I really like your idea	Ik hâld echt fan jo idee
Do not think of it any other way.	Tink der net op in oare manier oan.
He said no way.	Hy sei gjin manier.
I'm not sure how it got there.	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe't it dêr kaam.
Same with.	Itselde mei.
I tried for the time being again	Ik besocht foar de tiid wer
I knew better	Ik wist wol better
Tomorrow this house is probably mine.	Moarn is dit hûs miskien fan my.
I just knew he was	Ik wist gewoan dat hy wie
My mom never loved any of us.	Myn mem hat noait wat fan ús hâlden.
I'm glad I got him here	Ik bin bliid dat ik him hjir haw
He was clear.	Hy wie dúdlik.
I had never done it before	Ik hie it noch noait earder dien
That really set me back.	Dat sette my echt werom.
He would find his way here.	Hy soe hjir syn wei fine.
She ate it all up.	Se iet it allegear op.
I pay.	Ik betelje.
I think she's after school	Ik tink dat se nei de skoalle is
Maybe you can help each other.	Miskien kinne jo elkoar helpe.
And you should too.	En jo moatte ek.
He does not want to think.	Hy wol net tinke.
I was free from the police	Ik wie frij fan de plysje
I did not even realize it	Ik realisearre it net iens
It worked beautifully at that time.	It wurke yn dy tiid moai.
Her mother and father are there.	Har mem en heit binne der.
I can not say whether he knows it	Ik kin net sizze oft er it wit
You have not even met them.	Jo hawwe se net iens moete.
I've never done that before.	Ik haw it noch noait dien.
I know tomorrow morning	Ik wit moarn moarn
I already know where they're going	Ik wit al wêr't se hinne geane
It strikes me.	It komt my oan.
Can not find the right words yet.	Kin de goede wurden noch net fine.
It did not make it real.	It makke it net echt.
We need to be clear about this.	Wy moatte dúdlik wêze oer dit.
If he was going to do this, he had to do it.	As hy dit dwaan soe, moast er it dwaan.
I have my friends.	Ik haw myn freonen.
I did not leave now	Ik gie no net fuort
I just wanted to know where it came from	Ik woe gewoan witte wêr't it wei kaam
I hope you have been to work	Ik hoopje dat jo oan it wurk west hawwe
Do not let this happen to you.	Lit dit net barre mei dy.
I've seen it all	Ik haw dit alles sjoen
We have come to help.	Wy binne kommen om te helpen.
You have to show me how late it is and he did.	Jo moatte my sjen litte hoe let it is en hy die.
I knew her for a long time	Ik koe har al lang
It was a house.	It wie in hûs.
Is it that good.	Is dit sa goed.
I could not help it.	Ik koe it my net helpe.
Not for you and not for anyone.	Net foar jo en net foar gjinien.
I had to help him.	Ik moast him helpe.
Police say there were other parents as well.	De plysje seit dat der ek oare âlden wiene.
This was never the problem.	Dit wie nea it probleem.
I think this may be the problem.	Ik tink dat dit it probleem kin wêze.
I look forward to our next meeting	Ik sjoch út nei ús folgjende gearkomste
And this is exactly what it looks like.	En dit liket krekt.
I wish him well.	Ik winskje him goed.
I assume this was true	Ik nim oan dat dit wier wie
Do not come with.	Kom net mei.
Or just look at me.	Of sjoch allinnich my.
I was angry about that too	Dêr wie ik ek lilk om
The house was quite good.	It hûs wie hielendal goed.
I'm happy with that.	Dêr bin ik bliid mei.
I sure wish she would wake up	Ik winskje wis dat se wekker wurde soe
Let him be angry.	Lit him lilk wêze.
I feel so much better	Ik fiel my safolle better

He found no one there.	Hy fûn dêr gjinien.
Well, this is not the only way to do it.	No, dit is net de ienige manier om it te dwaan.
It's pretty easy.	It is frij maklik.
I did not want or need to either	Ik woe of nedich ek net
It's just.	It is gewoan.
I would get nothing.	Ik soe neat krije.
I read that too.	Dat haw ik ek lêzen.
Well, everyone sees the same thing.	No, elkenien sjocht itselde ding.

Either that or your best is just not good enough.	Of dat of jo bêste is gewoan net goed genôch.

I hope to get out of here too	Ik hoopje hjir ek wei te kommen
People need to be free.	Minsken moatte frij wêze.
I did not want to do anything more with it	Ik woe der neat mear mei dwaan
I might not need to talk too much	Ik soe miskien net te folle prate moatte
Nice to see you too.	Moai om dy ek te sjen.
I was not only scared anymore	Ik wie net allinnich bang mear
It was not entirely true.	It wie net hielendal wier.
I was just too surprised	Ik wie gewoan te ferrast
Well, you get the picture.	No, jo krije de foto.
He must have.	Hy moat hawwe.
There are so many friends to be found.	D'r binne safolle freonen te finen.
People will not believe me.	Minsken sille my net leauwe.
I really can not wait for it!	Ik kin der echt net op wachtsje!
I was looking forward to going home	Ik seach der nei út nei hûs te gean
I was determined to figure it out.	Ik wie besletten om it út te finen.
I can not do all this myself	Ik kin dit net allegear sels dwaan
I just wish it was done	Ik wol gewoan dat it dien is
She was ready, she knew.	Se wie klear, wist se.
We're going to where the money is.	Wy geane nei wêr't it jild is.
But she knew she had to tell him.	Mar se wist dat se it him fertelle moast.
I did not even see it	Ik seach it net iens
He has never done that before.	Dat hat er nea earder dien.
Maybe she does not know how.	Miskien wit se net hoe.
I have only one thing to say	Ik haw mar ien ding te sizzen
Just show up to drive and eat !.	Gewoan sjen litte te riden en ite!.
If this is you, I found your mother very nice.	As dit jo binne, fûn ik jo mem tige leuk.
I'm not scared anymore.	Ik bin net bang mear.
I hope you make it home in time	Ik hoopje dat jo it op 'e tiid thús meitsje
I want to see where you go to school	Ik wol sjen wêr't jo nei skoalle gean
He really did not know what to do.	Hy wist echt net wat er dwaan moast.
A man entered the room	In man kaam de keamer yn
I let it go.	Ik liet it gean.
I can not leave this	Ik kin dit net litte
I had to think.	Ik moast tinke.
There's just more of it.	Der is gewoan mear fan.
But it does not work.	Mar it wurket net.
And never such a one.	En nea sa'n ien.
This is our life.	Dit is ús libben.
But you never know for sure.	Mar jo witte noait wis.
They can handle it.	Se kinne it wol oan.
She's not coming.	Se komt net.
He was a very great friend.	Hy wie in tige grutte freon.
That's the way to go.	Dat is de manier om út te gean.
Come and sit with me.	Kom en sit by my.
The truth was, of course, very different.	De wierheid wie fansels hiel oars.
All you have to do is ask.	Alles wat jo hoege te dwaan is freegje.
But not anymore.	Mar net mear.
I was no longer a child.	Ik wie gjin bern mear.
And that could.	En dat koe.
They would not have children.	Se soene gjin bern krije.
If you'm good at it, then this is all.	As jo ​​​​dêr goed mei binne, dan is dit alles.
Could it.	Soe it kinne .
I can be there.	Ik kin der wêze.
Now it's up to me.	No is it oan my.
I know what family is here	Ik wit wat famylje is hjir
As my father is here.	As is myn heit hjir.
I had a few things to do	Ik hie in pear dingen te dwaan
I could tell him everything	Ik koe him alles fertelle
We know how it goes.	Wy witte hoe't it giet.
I still remember when he lived with us.	Ik wit it noch fan doe't er by ús wenne.
He had to get out there and find her.	Hy moast der út en fine har.
I was the reason for that	Ik wie dêr de reden foar
I'm coming in here.	Ik kom hjir yn.
I do not believe that either	Dat leau ik ek net
I would stay better.	Ik soe better bliuwe.
I needed the same from a woman	Ik hie itselde nedich fan in frou
Bart is tomorrow.	Bart is moarn.
Glad it's getting better now.	Bliid dat it no better giet.
She never felt sick, before or after.	Se fielde har noait siik, foar of nei.
I want to be your friend	ik wol dyn freon wêze
I just want to talk to him	Ik wol gewoan mei him prate
I could not wait to get old enough	Ik koe net wachtsje om âld genôch te wurden
Always do this.	Doch dit altyd.
She thought he had not heard her.	Se tocht dat er har net heard hie.
Mom said he never thought of me.	Mem sei dat er my noait tocht.
So we do nothing now.	Sa dogge wy no neat.
I am a mother and a wife	Ik bin in mem en in frou
I was afraid of not doing it.	Ik wie bang om it net te dwaan.
Let someone know what you are doing.	Lit immen witte wat jo dogge.
I will not have to think about it.	Ik sil der net oan tinke moatte.
I knew he would think there was something	Ik wist dat hy soe tinke dat der wat wie
I woke her up and asked what she wanted	Ik makke har wekker en frege wat se woe
I have a house here.	Ik haw hjir in hûs.
She said it would hurt.	Se sei dat it sear dwaan soe.
And there was probably a reason they were not.	En der wie wierskynlik in reden dat se net wiene.
I did not want to hurt him with the truth	Ik woe him net sear meitsje mei de wierheid
To this day, never had a problem.	Oant hjoed noch noait gjin probleem hân.
I know so many last words	Ik wit safolle lêste wurden
We had no idea they were there.	Wy hiene gjin idee dat se der wiene.
I was hoping for more	Ik hie op mear hope
He did not know where he was.	Hy wist net wêr't er wie.
But we should not have to.	Mar wy moatte net moatte.
I could not live with my parents for too long	Ik koe net te lang by myn âlden wenje
He walked like an old man.	Hy rûn as in âld man.
He looked back at the house.	Hy seach werom nei it hûs.
I can not really be with him and get a lot done	Ik kin net echt by him wêze en in protte dien krije
I think you might never like me.	Ik tink dat jo miskien noait fan my hâlde.
I was pretty sure no one had seen me	Ik wie der frij wis fan dat gjinien my sjoen hie
We know it since then.	Wy witte it sûnt dy tiid.
I am all this myself	Ik bin dit alles sels
I knew what she wanted.	Ik wist wat se woe.
I could not believe what exactly happened	Ik koe net leauwe wat der krekt barde
I have to see everything	Ik moat alles sjen
It was just hair.	It wie gewoan hier.
But his money was gone	Mar syn jild wie fuort
Everyone was surprised.	Elkenien wie ferrast.
Where they live.	Wêr't se wenje.
I thought she was my friend	Ik tocht dat se myn freon wie
Come with us !.	Kom mei ús!.
It started in the right way.	Dy is op 'e goede manier begûn.
And you just can not.	En jo kinne net gewoan.
I hope our day goes well	Ik hoopje dat ús dei goed komt
I did not really talk to anyone	Ik haw net echt mei ien praat
I asked her to tell me the name of her friend.	Ik frege har om my de namme fan har freon te fertellen.
I did not want to get in trouble	Ik woe net yn de problemen komme
I have no idea what exactly happened to my life	Ik ha gjin idee wat der krekt mei myn libben bard is
I really have to try it	Ik moat it echt besykje
It was right by the water.	It wie krekt by it wetter.
I wanted to tell him so much	Ik woe him safolle fertelle
It's not a problem.	It is gjin probleem.
I was ready to talk to him again	Ik wie ree om wer mei him te praten
I do not know how it works, really	Ik wit net hoe't it wurket, echt
This is what I have so far.	Dit is wat ik oant no ta haw.
I had to take care of her.	Ik moast foar har soargje.
It's not just in the morning.	It is net allinnich fan 'e moarn.
I was not sure what he wanted	Ik wie net wis wat er woe
I just need to talk to you	Ik moat gewoan mei dy prate
I want to know who they are.	Ik wol witte wa't se binne.
I was back after many days	Ik wie werom nei in protte dagen
Anyway, the boy went.	Hoe dan ek, de jonge gie.
I have the best job ever	Ik haw de bêste baan ea
Nobody wants to talk.	Nimmen wol prate.
That's for life.	Dat is foar it libben.
I really need to find a few more	Ik moat echt in pear mear fine
When was this.	Wannear wie dit.
I could not stand it	Ik soe it net oan kinne
It may already be next month.	It kin al takom moanne wêze.
He seems to find that difficult.	Hy liket dat dreech te finen.
Maybe he had some of them.	Miskien hie er fan har.
Maybe just those two.	Miskien krekt dy twa.
I need to get something done.	Ik moat wat dien krije.
Wait and it will be gone forever.	Wachtsje en it sil foar altyd fuort wêze.
There was now no more return for her.	Der wie no gjin mear werom foar har.
I'll be back tomorrow	Ik kom moarn werom
Here's one that does not.	Hjir is ien dy't net docht.
The song comes first	It liet komt earst
That it was all true.	Dat it allegear wier wie.
I do not know how it should be	Ik wit net hoe't it moat
Both here and there.	Sawol hjir en dêr.
She asked alone.	Se frege allinnich.
He needs to get to bed.	Hy moat op bêd.
That he had seen.	Dat hie er sjoen.
And they can show it to him.	En se kinne it him sjen litte.
I know what's going on	Ik wit wat der bart
I eat them out of hand.	Ik yt se út 'e hân.
Maybe it's getting better.	Miskien wurdt it better.
I made sure she's not in the room	Ik die dat se net yn 'e keamer is
I love being out here	Ik hâld fan wêzen út hjir
I'm not feeling well at all.	It giet my hielendal net goed.
Show me, boy.	Lit my sjen, jonge.
And that was that.	En dat wie dat.
I do not want anything to do with it.	Ik wol der neat mei ha.
I got pretty good at it	Ik waard der aardich goed yn
And that's what it's about.	En dêr giet it om.
I still do.	Ik noch altyd.
He went on with his life.	Hy gie troch mei syn libben.
I just wanted to know about one thing	Ik woe gewoan oer ien ding witte
I just was not happy.	Ik wie gewoan net bliid.
I'm fine with that.	Ik bin der goed mei.
Maybe there was a chance.	Miskien wie der in kâns.
I could not believe it was true	Ik koe net leauwe dat it wier wie
Mom was.	Mem wie.
You are not her.	Do bist har net.
I thought you would like to go with me	Ik tocht dat jo graach mei my gean soene
And it's fun.	En it is leuk.
Maybe.	Miskien.
Remember, it would not do to stay too long.	Tink, it soe net dwaan om te lang te bliuwen.
I have to get to work.	Ik moat oan it wurk.
See also this question.	Sjoch ek dizze fraach.
Try to come up here for a weekend.	Besykje hjir in wykein op te kommen.
A photo of his parents	In foto fan syn âlden
Could not have asked for more.	Koe net hawwe frege om mear.
I hope to see him tomorrow	Ik hoopje him moarn te sjen

After this.	Nei dizze.
Everyone come and have a good time.	Elkenien komme en hawwe in goede tiid.
I did not want him to go	Ik woe net dat er gie
What she said is wrong.	Wat se sei is ferkeard.
I found it just right myself	Ik fûn it sels krekt
I let him out of the car.	Ik liet him de auto út.
I would love to have one	Ik soe graach ien hawwe
I know your work, of course.	Ik ken dyn wurk, fansels.
You do not even have to talk to me.	Jo hoege net iens mei my te praten.
I know how it all works	Ik wit hoe't it allegear wurket
I love this place and love the people	Ik hâld fan dit plak en hâld fan 'e minsken
My mother had the same hair.	Myn mem hie itselde hier.
But this, of course, could not.	Mar dit koe fansels net.
I can take you there, if you want	Ik kin jo der nei nimme, as jo wolle
I'm out of your way in a few days.	Ik bin oer in pear dagen út jo wei.
This is what these people believe in.	Dit is wat dizze minsken leauwe yn.
He would have gotten it too.	Hy soe it ek krigen hawwe.
I will not leave this thing, boy.	Ik sil dit ding net litte, jonge.
I was hurt all the time	Ik hie de hiele tiid sear
I know what's happening now	Ik wit wat der no bart
You know what it is.	Jo witte wat it ek is.
He looked tired.	Hy seach wurch.
I look forward to reading it	Ik sjoch der nei út om it te lêzen
I would look into it for hours.	Ik soe der oeren yn sjen.
On that day.	Op dy dei.
It's his money.	It is syn jild.
No one shows up.	Gjinien lit sjen.
He can not be yet.	Hy kin noch net wêze.
I will give you another one more time.	Ik sil dy in oare kear mear jaan.
They are the evening.	Se binne de jûn.
It seemed the same.	It like itselde.

I had just talked to her	Ik hie krekt mei har praat
I did not know it until after it happened	Ik wist it net oant nei it barde
She knew she had not long.	Se wist dat se net lang hie.
That's what we did.	Dat hawwe wy dien.
I can better get back to work	Ik kin better wer oan it wurk
We're talking some more.	Wy prate noch wat.
That I had to give him	Dat moast ik him jaan
Who we talk to, what we tell them.	Mei wa't wy prate, wat fertelle wy har.
But not my parents.	Mar myn âlden net.
Or not enough people.	Of net genôch minsken.
I will not stop again	Ik sil net wer ophâlde
She knew she wanted more from him.	Se wist dat se mear fan him woe.
I certainly did not expect that	Dat hie ik wis net ferwachte
I can not say much more now	Ik kin no net folle mear sizze
And those people have actually seen it.	En dy minsken hawwe it eins sjoen.
He waited a long time.	Hy wachte lang.
It's what the movie is about.	It is wêr't de film oer giet.
You did really well there.	Jo hawwe it der echt goed dien.
I did not know how to be a man	Ik wist net hoe't ik in man wêze moast
How can she help me? 	Hoe kin se my helpe?
I really was not ready to see him yet	Ik wie echt noch net ree om him te sjen
She was one of those people.	Se wie ien fan dy minsken.
I think you get the picture.	Ik tink dat jo de foto krije.
I wanted to become a teacher	Ik woe learaar wurde
You do this twice.	Dat dogge jo twa kear.
Do not take my word for it, please.	Nim myn wurd der net foar, asjebleaft.
I think that should be seen as a great opportunity	Ik tink dat dat moat wurde sjoen as in grutte kâns
I was not angry or hurt	Ik wie net lilk of sear
There are just so many.	D'r binne gewoan safolle.
A life with me and your mother	In libben mei my en dyn mem
I can not speak well.	Ik kin net goed prate.

I know how hard it must be for you	Ik wit hoe dreech it wêze moat foar dy
She could not eat it.	Se koe it net ite.
As for oft.	As foar oft.
You will feel good here with your teacher and the other children.	Jo sille hjir goed fine mei jo learaar en de oare bern.
I just have to ask him something	Ik moat him mar wat freegje
Know what you are eating.	Witte wat jo ite.
I have to do this today	Ik moat dit dien hjoed
See if anyone had it for him.	Sjoch as immen it foar him hie.
They did not seem to care at all.	Se like hielendal net soargen.
Maybe there were more.	Miskien wiene der mear.
I thought it would be about this city.	Ik tocht dat it oer dizze stêd gean soe.
I had no friend	Ik hie gjin freon
He had something she did not have.	Hy hie wat dat se net hie.
This is how they work.	Sa wurkje se.
It was her only hope.	It wie har ienige hope.
I do not have much to tell you	Ik haw dy net folle te fertellen
At first, of course, she could not take the money.	Earst koe se it jild fansels net nimme.
It's not my house, not my house.	It is net myn hûs, net myn hûs.
And it happened again.	En it barde wer.
He said you knew.	Hy sei dat jo wisten.
I assume she's my only friend	Ik nim oan dat se myn ienige freon is
We know we are just as good as they are.	Wy witte dat wy krekt sa goed binne as se.
And it hurt him.	En it die him sear.

That I could do better now.	Dat mocht ik no better dwaan.
I wanted to stay with you in bed	Ik woe graach by dy op bêd bliuwe
I would really like to come back here.	Ik soe hjir echt graach werom komme.
I can still have that chance.	Dy kâns kin ik noch ha.
I want it all to be me	Ik wol dat it allegear my is
I never had the chance to go back for her	Ik hie noait de kâns om foar har werom te gean
From day one onwards.	Fan dei ien ôf.
She would not eat.	Se soe net ite.
People can say what they want.	Minsken kinne sizze wat se wolle.
I tried to keep him away.	Ik besocht him fuort te hâlden.
The woman knew that.	Dat wist de frou.
I'm glad you like me.	Ik bin bliid dat jo my leuk fine.
I heard them talking.	Ik hearde se praten.
They don’t make them anymore.	Se meitsje se net mear.
I was afraid they would do the same to me.	Ik wie bang dat se my dat ek dogge.
I wondered who might have seen me	Ik frege my ôf wa't my miskien seach
The best of his life.	It bêste fan syn libben.
Hope you and family are well.	Hoopje jo en famylje goed.

He looked back at me.	Hy seach my werom.
I love this time of the morning.	Ik hâld fan dizze tiid fan 'e moarn.
I did not want to talk about the truth.	Ik woe net oer de wierheid prate.
And that is very true.	En dat is tige wier.
That's clear enough.	Dat is dúdlik genôch.
I'm the one who loves you	Ik bin dejinge dy't jo hâldt
They both work just fine.	Se wurkje beide gewoan goed.
I was too late.	Ik wie te let.
You have not seen.	Do hast net sjoen.
He is a good person.	Hy is in goed persoan.
I could tell he wanted to tell me something	Ik koe sizze dat hy my wat fertelle woe
I think they were not ready for me	Ik tink dat se net foar my klear wiene
I just wanted to be sure	Ik woe gewoan wis wêze
I have to buy another one.	Ik moat noch ien keapje.
I soon regretted it	Ik hie der gau spyt fan
I need to be in a better movie than this	Ik moat yn in bettere film wêze as dit

And the other three.	En de oare trije.

I just saw it again	Ik seach it krekt wer
Can not be done.	Kin net dien wurde.
That was too.	Dat wie ek.
I will love you forever	Ik sil foar altyd fan dy hâlde
I do not know what else to do.	Ik wit net wat ik oars dwaan moat.
I want to do a few more things with you	Ik wol noch in pear dingen mei dy dwaan
Try them all.	Besykje se allegear.
For me, it was really easy to do that.	Foar my wie it echt maklik om dat te dwaan.

We are good, they say.	Wy binne goed, sizze se.
We talk about nothing and everything.	Wy prate oer neat en fan alles.
I will not have it anymore.	Ik sil it net mear ha.
Come back next week.	Kom nije wike werom.

She was old, very old.	Se wie âld, hiel âld.
I do not know the reason.	Ik wit de reden net.
But he did not want to be mean to his friend.	Mar hy woe net min wêze tsjin syn freon.
I wish it was just me and me alone	Ik woe dat it allinnich ik en my allinnich wie

She would never be able to.	Se soe it noait kinne.
I'll be a good guy	Ik sil in goede keardel wêze
I want you to have that food with me	Ik wol dat jo dat iten mei my hawwe

Try not to hurt anyone.	Besykje gjinien sear te meitsjen.
Can here though.	Kin hjir wol.
I'm so glad she had the chance to talk to you.	Ik bin sa bliid dat se de kâns hie om mei jo te praten.
What! 	Wat!
How the.	Hoe die.

I'll have more to say that morning	Ik sil dy moarn mear te sizzen hawwe
I need to be home again	Ik moat wer thús wêze
I'll come with you	Ik sil mei dy komme
I could not think of her now	Ik koe no net oan har tinke
I tried one, and then the other	Ik besocht ien, en dan de oare
I think he just does not know you very well yet	Ik tink dat hy dy gewoan noch net sa goed ken
I want to be your life itself	Ik wol dyn libben sels wêze
I did not expect them all to be here	Ik hie net ferwachte dat se hjir allegear wiene
I can not just wait to see what happens	Ik kin net gewoan wachtsje om te sjen wat der bart

That's what I would like.	Dat soe ik graach wolle.
I have not told her about this work yet	Ik haw har noch net ferteld oer dit wurk
I hope she does not see it	Ik hoopje dat se it net sjocht
I was with you the whole time	Ik wie de hiele tiid by dy
They're just going to make things.	Se geane gewoan dingen meitsje.
I see that pretty clearly.	Ik sjoch dat moai dúdlik.
So they have to make something.	Sa moatte se wat meitsje.
Wouldn't want the old boy to worry.	Soe de âld jonge gjin soargen meitsje wolle.
I did not want to say anything.	Ik woe neat sizze.
I'm just walking through your city	Ik gean krekt troch jo stêd
Well, she said.	No, sei se.
I was not sure if he did it or not	Ik hie der net wis fan west oft er it die of net
I need to talk to someone.	Ik moat mei immen prate.
We never talked about it.	Wy hawwe der noait oer praat.
Or maybe they have.	Of miskien hawwe se.
I quickly gave up on picking them up	Ik joech al gau op om se op te nimmen
I quickly looked back	Ik seach gau werom
I have to go back to the city.	Ik moat werom nei de stêd.
I know so little about him	Ik wit sa'n bytsje oer him
He just wanted it to stop.	Hy woe gewoan dat it ophâlde.
I handed over the money	Ik joech it jild oer
It was just too soon.	It wie gewoan te gau.
I think, if that's what you want	Ik tink, as dat is wat jo wolle
But you did not.	Mar do hast net.
It never needs another name.	It hat nea in oare namme nedich.
Are we looking at everything.	Binne wy ​​​​nei alles te sjen.
But we will have a new family.	Mar wy sille in nije famylje hawwe.
They just made it.	Se hawwe it krekt makke.
I was glad everything was fine	Ik wie bliid dat alles goed wie
You never talk to us about school again.	Jo prate noait mear mei ús oer skoalle.
I'm not a bad man.	Ik bin gjin min man.
It just made you happy	It makke jo gewoan bliid
Why? 	Wêrom?
I should have done something	Ik hie wat dwaan moatten
He did not have to be here.	Hy hoegde hjir net te wêzen.
We've had enough of it.	Wy hawwe der genôch fan.
She did not feel good enough to go out.	Se fielde har net goed genôch om út te gean.
I can be a husband and father	Ik kin in man en heit wêze
I know how things work.	Ik wit hoe't dingen wurkje.
This question is still open.	Dizze fraach is noch altyd iepen.
Knew where she was.	Wist wêr't se wie.
His next question would be.	Syn folgjende fraach soe wêze.
We are what we do.	Wy binne wat wy dogge.
I was gone.	Ik wie fuort.
I have not seen the man myself.	Ik haw de man sels net sjoen.
I just thought of the police	Ik tocht krekt oan de plysje
I know you were not there.	Ik wit dat jo der net wiene.
I felt so hurt.	Ik fielde my sa sear.
I've waited long enough	Ik haw lang genôch wachte
You just have to.	Jo moatte gewoan.
About everything, she would say.	Oer alles, soe se sizze.
I think he's better for it	Ik tink dat hy der better foar is
I want to tell you.	Ik wol dy sizze.
She knows better than anyone.	Se wit better as elkenien.
I think this is what happened	Ik tink dat dit is wat bard
We really love each other.	Wy hâlde echt fan elkoar.
I did not even know why.	Ik wist net iens wêrom.
She was the only one who did it.	Se wie de ienige dy't it die.
That's not why.	Dat is net wêrom.
I would not be different	Ik soe net oars wêze
But it was hard not to.	Mar it wie dreech net.
I did not like much of him	Ik mocht net folle fan him
I liked you a bit	Ik haw jo in bytsje leuk fûn
He would ask her.	Hy soe har freegje.
I guess let her think what she wants	Ik tink lit har tinke wat se wol
I know you would take care of our children.	Ik wit dat jo foar ús bern soargje soene.
That's just fine.	Dat is gewoan goed.
It is not a way of being.	It is gjin manier fan wêzen.
I was awake and ready	Ik wie wekker en klear
It's so fun.	It is sa leuk.
I'm sure you've seen this	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo dit sjoen hawwe
Only this year.	Allinnich dit jier.
I would love to win.	Ik soe graach winne.
You knew he was there.	Jo wisten dat hy der wie.
I never took any money	Ik nea naam gjin jild
Now clear out.	No dúdlik út.
I really love her	Ik hâld echt fan har
But no one else would do anything about it	Mar nimmen oars soe der wat oan dwaan
I have to be there tonight.	Ik moat der fannacht wêze.
Not exactly what you think.	Net krekt wat jo tinke.
I know what kind of person you are	Ik wit wat foar in persoan do bist
I know of a really good place	Ik wit fan in echt goed plak
You know that, but it does not.	Jo witte dat, mar it docht it net.
We need to be on you, but can not see you.	Wy moatte op jo wêze, mar kinne jo net sjen.
I did everything myself.	Ik die alles sels.
We are, you will see.	Wy binne, dat sille jo sjen.
Very, very bad.	Hiel, heul min.
When he heard me he came to me.	Doe't er my hearde kaam er nei my ta.
You are with her.	Do bist by har.
I should not do this	Ik soe dit net dwaan moatte
I knew exactly what he was doing	Ik wist krekt wat hy die
And there is much more of the same.	En der is folle mear fan itselde.
I need to show you how to find it	Ik moat jo sjen litte hoe't jo it fine kinne
I know exactly where they are	Ik wit krekt wêr't se binne
Now everything is clear to the people.	No stiet alles dúdlik foar de minsken.
I heard it three times	Ik hearde it trije kear
He had to come up with a plan.	Hy moast mei in plan komme.
I did not even think about that	Dêr tocht ik net iens oan
Can be a lot of other people too.	Kin ek in protte oare minsken wêze.
I hope you are not	Ik hoopje dat jo net sa binne
No more talking.	Gjin praat mear.
I'll come find you	Ik sil dy komme fine
But I'm so sure there is not.	Mar ik bin der sa wis fan dat der net is.
I do want to.	Ik doch dat wol.
I know my mom wants me to live with her	Ik wit dat myn mem wol dat ik by har wenje
I saw you twice, a few weeks ago	Ik seach dy twa kear, in pear wike lyn
I wonder what you are doing now	Ik freegje my ôf wat jo no dogge
I can not afford to participate	Ik kin my net betelje om mei te dwaan
He does what needs to be done.	Hy docht wat der dien wurde moat.
You do not get away with this.	Jo komme net fuort mei dit.
But she was no more.	Mar se wie net mear.
You can not keep them forever.	Jo kinne har net foar altyd hâlde.
How do you say.	Hoe sizze jo.
I still have so many friends there	Ik haw dêr noch safolle freonen
If we can do it, so can you.	As wy it kinne, kinne jo dat ek.
I need to get him some money	Ik moat him wat jild krije
I hope she was not waiting for me	Ik hope dat se net op my wachte
I show it to people.	Ik lit it minsken sjen.
It's nice to see.	It is moai om te sjen.
We talked about him after the first time at that party.	Wy hawwe it oer him nei de earste kear op dat feest.
He felt he needed it for himself.	Hy fielde dat er it foar himsels nedich hie.
I could not leave it.	Ik koe it net litte.
He tried three times.	Hy besocht trije kear.
I just want to give myself to him	Ik wol my mar oan him jaan
I would not stay there long	Ik soe dêr net lang bliuwe
He says he wants nothing from her in his office.	Hy seit dat er neat fan har yn syn kantoar wol.
He does not want to give her a reason to stay away.	Hy wol har gjin reden jaan om fuort te bliuwen.
It does not come up.	It komt net op.
I was very happy for her	Ik wie tige bliid foar har
I think it should be clear.	Ik tink dat it dúdlik wêze moat.
And for us.	En foar ús.
I did not always have it	Ik hie it net altyd
I never even said a word to her.	Ik sei noait iens in wurd tsjin har.
He must have a good reason.	Hy moat in goede reden hawwe.
I doubt we will do that much again	Ik twifelje dat wy dat wer in protte sille dwaan
You might want to try that.	Jo kinne dat miskien besykje.
I need to do some work there	Ik moat der wat wurk dwaan
She wants to be her.	Se wol har wêze.
I was ready to go home	Ik wie klear om nei hûs te gean
She was so happy to see him.	Se wie sa bliid om him te sjen.
And this is the reason why.	En dit is de reden wêrom.
He gave him everything he had.	Hy joech him alles wat er hie.
I could do things, make things that no one else could	Ik koe dingen dwaan, dingen meitsje dy't gjinien oars koe
Maybe it was not too late.	Miskien wie it net te let.
We'll be back before you know it.	Wy komme werom foardat jo it witte.
I said it was.	Ik sei dat it wie.
This is not your money.	Dit is net dyn jild.
I know what will happen	Ik wit wat der barre sil
I could see him clearly	Ik koe him dúdlik sjen
Now this is a time in my life where life was good.	No is dit in tiid yn myn libben wêr't it libben goed wie.
That's still not easy.	Dat is noch altyd net maklik.
In fact, there is no money.	Eins is der gjin jild.
I can not even find them beautiful	Ik kin se net iens moai fine
It went well.	It gie goed.
There is no such thing as knowing our place.	Der is net sa'n ding as witte ús plak.
He himself was not sure.	Hy wie sels net wis.
We will make children.	Wy sille bern meitsje.
I have to keep you with me	Ik moat dy by my hâlde
But she is a good child.	Mar se is in goed bern.
A year ago it would not have been	In jier lyn soe it net west hawwe
He never told me anything else.	Hy hat my noait wat oars ferteld.
Mom wants you.	Mem wol dy.
He has a wife.	Hy hat in frou.
They had talked for hours about what they were going to do.	Se hiene oeren praat oer wat se dwaan soene.
I just want to know what you think	Ik wol gewoan witte wat jo tinke
I asked her for her name	Ik frege har om har namme
And of course he never had.	En dat hie er fansels noait.
I want us to try it	Ik wol dat wy it besykje
I did not do it	Ik haw it net dien
Which would leave him with what he had now.	Wat him litte soe mei wat er no hie.
I love the whole thing	Ik hâld fan it hiele ding
I know enough to do it	Ik wit genôch om it te dwaan
I did not know what it was about	Ik wist net wêr't it oer gie
I walked over to my dad	Ik rûn nei myn heit ta
He can not help himself.	Hy kin himsels net helpe.
I just can not believe you were the one who found him	Ik kin gewoan net leauwe dat jo it wiene dy't him fûn hawwe
I need to try something	Ik moat wat besykje
I did not get a chance to	Ik krige gjin kâns om
I think we should see it, believe it	Ik tink dat wy it sjen moatte, it leauwe
I know nothing about it	Ik wit der neat fan
I will not have it.	Ik sil it net ha.
I do none of these things	Ik doch gjin fan dizze dingen
It's good.	It is wol goed.
Of course it was him.	Fansels wie it him.
Nothing like this.	Neat as dit.
Nothing worked for me.	Neat wurke foar my.
I feel for his family and friends.	Ik fiel foar syn famylje en freonen.
I know knew what that was	Ik wit wist wat dat wie
I want to see everything well in person	Ik wol alles goed sjen yn in persoan
Or his hurt.	Of syn sear.
I did this too	Ik haw dit ek dien
He had an idea of ​​what my life would be like.	Hy hie in idee fan hoe't myn libben wêze soe.
I have no idea where he lives	Ik ha gjin idee wêr't er wennet
This is what causes you problems.	Dit is wat jo jo problemen meitsje.
And it would have worked.	En it soe hawwe wurke.
I knew what would happen then	Ik wist wat der dan barre soe
They have no idea what it's like.	Se hawwe gjin idee hoe't it is.
This song has it all.	Dit liet hat alles.
I can not believe this has happened	Ik kin net leauwe dat dit bard is
And now he was in trouble again.	En no siet er wer yn de problemen.
And these are many.	En dit binne in protte.
I could not find him, he could not find me.	Ik koe him net fine, hy koe my net fine.
I'm so sorry they did that to you	It spyt my sa dat se dat oan dy diene
But this time nothing comes.	Mar dizze kear komt neat.
I have no idea where he is	Ik ha gjin idee wêr't hy is
It's a lot.	It is in protte.
And it scares me.	En it makket my bang.
Would be given.	Soe jûn wurde.
He would be my wife.	Hy soe myn frou wêze.
There must be some reason for that.	Dêr moat wat reden foar wêze.
Not now, not anymore.	Net no, net mear.
I really wanted to eat with you	Ik woe echt ite mei dy
I'll find you.	Ik sil dy fine.
I know who they are.	Ik wit wa't se binne.
I did not know why he was around	Ik wist net wêrom't er der om hie
I'm doing it pretty well.	Ik doch it aardich goed.
And they will agree.	En se sille it iens wêze.
You're never around.	Jo binne nea om.
But if it does not work, it does not work.	Mar as it net wurket, wurket it net.
Nobody needs to know.	Nimmen moat it witte.
What goes in must come out.	Wat der yn giet, moat út.
And it's been so long ago.	En it is sa lang lyn.
I do not know if she was in the room.	Ik wit net oft se yn 'e keamer wie.
You can not have one without the other.	Jo kinne net hawwe ien sûnder de oare.
I waited and gave her time.	Ik wachte en joech har tiid.
Back to you.	Werom nei dy.
I was on everything	Ik wie op alles
He was really here.	Hy wie hjir echt.
I need you with me here	Ik haw dy by my hjir nedich
I would love to be here.	Ik soe hjir graach wêze wolle.
I can not see, but do not remember	Ik kin net sjen, mar tink my net
He wanted her out of here.	Hy woe har hjir wei.
But he needed to know more.	Mar hy moast wol mear witte.
I could not do that to anyone else	Ik koe dat oan gjinien oars dwaan
Or sit on it.	Of siet der op.
That, of course, was not enough.	Dat wie fansels net genôch.
I know this though	Ik wit dit wol
I wonder if this is true	Ik freegje my ôf oft dit wier is
I had no idea what to say to him	Ik hie gjin idee wat ik tsjin him sizze moast
I've only seen him twice.	Ik haw him mar twa kear sjoen.
But, there are two problems with that.	Mar, d'r binne twa problemen mei dat.
She would leave that enough.	Se soe dat genôch litte.
He looks at the picture, looks at you, and back again.	Hy sjocht nei de foto, sjocht nei dy, en wer werom.
And so she is.	En sa is se.
Who will be the first to find it ?.	Wa sil de earste wêze om it te finen?.
Not so today.	Net sa hjoed.
It comes so well with you.	It komt sa goed mei jo.
It was her young husband.	It wie har jonge man.
But she did not want to think about that.	Mar dêr woe se net oan tinke.
No one else will do it for us.	Nimmen oars sil it foar ús dwaan.
Go back to your family.	Gean werom nei jo famylje.
I wish we had never been here at all	Ik winskje dat wy hjir hielendal nea kommen wiene
This way it works well.	Op dizze manier wurket it goed.
I never thought we would find him.	Ik hie noait tocht dat wy him fine soene.
I must have done something right	Ik moat wat goed dien hawwe
I can see it, clearly	Ik kin it sjen, dúdlik
That can cause problems.	Dat kin foar problemen soargje.
I have no idea what that was about	Ik ha gjin idee wêr't dat oer gie
I almost felt at home	Ik fielde my hast thús
Something may happen here tonight, or something may not.	Der kin hjir fannacht wat bart, of wat kin net.
That we can say.	Dat kinne wy ​​sizze.
See where he goes, what he does.	Sjoch wêr't hy giet, wat hy docht.
I'm not looking at her.	Ik sjoch nimmen nei har.
You say something with this.	Jo sizze wat mei dizze.
I expected more from her	Ik ferwachte mear fan har
And that's exactly what happened.	En dat is krekt wat bard.
This was good.	Dit wie goed.
I have no idea if you can or not	Ik haw gjin idee as jo kinne of net
Since he would not.	Sûnt hy soe net.
To make you whole again.	Om dy wer hiel te meitsjen.
I did not want to talk about it	Ik woe der net oer prate
It was gone as if it had never been there.	It wie fuort as hie it der nea west.
You're all gone.	Do bist hielendal fuort.
He's like a father.	Hy is as in heit.
I am of you in this life and the next	Ik bin fan jo yn dit libben en it folgjende
I realized he had seen me too.	Ik realisearre dat hy my ek sjoen hie.
It has done us very well.	It hat ús tige goed dien.
I'll take them both to your house now	Ik nim se no beide nei jo hûs
He knows her car.	Hy ken har auto.
I knew it like a book.	Ik wist it as in boek.
I did not know him so well	Ik koe him net sa goed
Maybe he had.	Miskien hie er.
There is eating and talking.	Der wurdt iten en praat.
If he goes to that place, they will not be there.	As er op dat plak giet, sille se der net wêze.
I just did not like what she said	Ik mocht gewoan net leuk wat se sei
I asked him why he wanted to know	Ik frege him wêrom't er it witte woe
Just ask us.	Freegje it ús mar.
I'm glad to be just with him	Ik bin bliid gewoan by him te wêzen
I would not have thought of it	Ik soe der neat fan tocht hawwe
I was angry that my father was not there	Ik wie lilk dat myn heit der net wie
You've never had one of those hands before.	Jo hawwe noch noait ien fan dy hân, earder.
You need to know.	Jo moatte witte.
And you can stay as long as you want.	En jo kinne bliuwe sa lang as jo wolle.
People talk differently there.	Minsken prate dêr oars.
The truth is that no one can be sure yet.	De wierheid is dat gjinien noch wis kin wêze.
It's not just one thing.	It is net mar ien ding.
I was against that at school.	Dêr wie ik op skoalle op tsjin.
I almost died.	Ik stoar hast.
It hit just right for me.	It rekke krekt foar my.
Maybe he was getting old.	Miskien waard er âld.
It's just the kind of person he is.	It is krekt it soarte fan persoan hy is.
I did not really belong there.	Ik hearde der eins net by.
But with words, it was pretty good.	Mar mei wurden wie it aardich goed.
He knows of nothing.	Hy wit fan neat.
I'll give you a year.	Ik jou dy in jier.
He wanted more.	Hy woe mear.
We had found them.	Wy hiene se fûn.
Everyone will know who you are and where you live.	Elkenien sil witte wa't jo binne en wêr't jo wenje.
Even a very young woman.	Sels in hiel jonge frou.
I can see her.	Ik kin har sjen.
I can see you have both	Ik kin sjen dat jo beide hawwe
I need you to do something for me	Ik haw jo nedich om wat foar my te dwaan
You are in a place.	Jo binne op in plak.
You are the one who makes them.	Jo binne dejinge dy't se makket.
There should be no one.	Der moat gjinien wêze.
And please.	En asjebleaft.
I had never been to such a place	Ik hie noch noait op sa'n plak west
I thought exactly the same thing	Ik tocht krekt itselde
I thought she was just one of them	Ik tocht dat se mar ien fan har wie
I think he just needs time	Ik tink dat hy gewoan tiid nedich hat
I looked just like him in the picture	Ik like krekt as him op 'e foto
But, this idea is also wrong.	Mar, dit idee is ek ferkeard.
Some read done but still have many questions.	Wat lêzen dien, mar hawwe noch in protte fragen.
I can see so much this way.	Ik kin safolle sjen op dizze manier.
I was just happy.	Ik wie gewoan bliid.
I could go there every day	Ik koe der alle dagen hinne
Isn't it time we did something about this?	Is it net tiid dat wy hjir wat oan dogge?
I did not run from or run with anyone else	Ik rûn net fan of rûn mei immen oars
He liked the idea.	Hy fûn it idee goed.
And it probably was, but you're the reason.	En it wie wierskynlik, mar jo binne de reden wêrom.
I think it's time to go back.	Ik tink dat it tiid is om werom te gean.
These were real.	Dizze wiene echt.
Of good hard work.	Fan goed hurd wurk.
But she would have to.	Mar se soe moatte.
I felt so better	Ik fielde my sa better
I have to go to my office	Ik moat fuort nei myn kantoar
You need to get in or out of bed.	Jo moatte yn of út it bêd.
Leave it at that.	Lit it der by.
She did not try again	Se besocht it net wer
They said we were sorry.	Se seine it spyt ús.
Boy have they been there the last two days.	Jonge ha se der de lêste twa dagen oan west.
We would love to have you back.	Wy wolle jo graach werom hawwe.
You were the one who came along.	Jo wiene dejinge dy't der mei kaam.
Or the week.	Of de wike.
The two were one.	De twa wiene ien.
I could not believe they were talking about me	Ik koe net leauwe dat se it oer my hiene
I have no idea how long it's been there	Ik ha gjin idee hoe lang it der al west hat
I'll be waiting here.	Ik sil hjir wachtsje.
I'm one and so are you	Ik bin ien en do ek
I made myself just stay there	Ik makke my gewoan bliuwe dêr
And if they knew, they would not hold me back.	En as se wisten soene se it my net tsjin hâlde.
I could not believe them	Ik koe se net leauwe
I can not yet.	Ik kin noch net.
It was the man.	It wie de man.
It's a beautiful life.	It is in moai libben.
Or it will happen.	Of it sil barre.
We did, again and again.	Wy diene, wer en wer.
I just had to have you	Ik moast dy mar hawwe
It's the only life anyone's ever had.	It is it ienige libben dat immen ea hat.
I often wondered how he could live in that house	Ik frege my faak ôf hoe't er yn dat hûs wenje koe
That used to be not the case.	Dat wie eartiids net sa.
I just want it to be you and me	Ik wol gewoan dat it jo en ik binne
I tried to find the right words to say	Ik besocht de goede wurden te finen om te sizzen
Even on the weekends.	Sels yn it wykein.
They are not trying to make things better.	Se besykje net dingen better te meitsjen.
If he stayed, he knew what would happen.	As er bleau, wist er wat der barre soe.
She felt much better.	Se fielde har folle better.
I think that's probably just as wrong	Ik tink dat dat wierskynlik like ferkeard is
I had been up all day	Ik hie de hiele dei op west
I just did not always want to be alone	Ik woe gewoan net altyd allinnich wêze
Stop if necessary.	Hâld op as it nedich is.
He told me that.	Hy fertelde my dat.
I do not know what it was about.	Ik wit net wêr't it oer gie.
I just want to help people	Ik wol allinnich minsken helpe
I want your help.	Ik wol dyn help.
I need the money today.	Ik haw hjoed it jild nedich.
That's what I should ask you	Dat soe ik dy freegje moatte
Did no one tell me.	Hat nimmen my ferteld.
Of course it was.	Fansels wie it.
I could be.	Ik koe wêze.
He is so good at reading.	Hy is sa goed om te lêzen.
Looking forward to going back.	Sjoch út nei werom te gean.
Not once did that happen.	Net ien kear barde dat.
I knew he loved my dad	Ik wist dat hy fan myn heit hâlde
I still remember I went, and our family arrived early one year.	Ik wit noch dat ik gie, en ús famylje kaam betiid ien jier.
But they did not try.	Mar dat hawwe se net besocht.
I hope to have dinner with you this evening	Ik hoopje dizze jûn mei jo te iten
If there was one.	As der ien wie.
I've done what you want.	Ik haw dien wat jo wolle.
I did not even know what would happen	Ik wist net iens wat der barre soe
That's not much.	Dat is net folle.
Only friends do.	Allinnich freonen dogge.
I believe so much in you	Ik leau safolle yn dy
I'm still planning to come tomorrow.	Ik bin noch fan plan om moarn te kommen.
I did get over it though	Ik kaam der wol oer
He knew what his job was.	Hy wist wat syn baan wie.
Nothing would be done around the house.	Der soe neat dien wurde om it hûs.
We never said that.	Dat hawwe wy nea sein.
But nothing seemed like a problem.	Mar neat like in probleem.
That's her in the picture there.	Dat is har op 'e foto dêr.
But that's what you need to do.	Mar dat is wat jo moatte dwaan.
I have friends there	Ik haw freonen dêr
She knows it.	Se wit dit.
I have a husband and two children.	Ik haw in man en twa bern.
Your mother was the same.	Dyn mem wie itselde.
I want to believe him	Ik wol him wol leauwe
I think he's heard that before.	Ik tink dat hy dat al earder heard hat.
I know you like her	Ik wit dat jo har leuk fine
And that's the.	En dat die se.
I knew nothing of her or about	Ik wist neat fan har of oer
I walked away from my job in the room	Ik rûn fuort fan myn baan yn 'e keamer
Please, he said.	Asjebleaft, sei er.
They work very hard at it.	Se wurkje der tige hurd oan.
I knew something was going to happen	Ik wist dat der wat soe barre
I'm fine with this.	Ik bin goed mei dit.
I do not know who told you that before.	Ik wit net wa't dy dat earder ferteld hat.
I had nothing to do with it either	Ik hie der ek neat om
I had no idea what was going on	Ik hie gjin idee wat der oan de hân wie
But it's what happens.	Mar it is wat der bart.
I've been away three days	Ik bin trije dagen fuort west
He said you can go home.	Hy sei dat jo nei hûs kinne.
Come on, boy, give that time.	Kom op, jonge, jou dy tiid.
I know it did for me.	Ik wit dat it foar my dien hat.
No one else can know.	Nimmen oars kin witte.
I could not see him.	Ik koe him net sjen.
People who were there to hurt.	Minsken dy't der wiene om sear te meitsjen.
We stand up for each other.	Wy komme foar elkoar op.
It could not be my dog.	It koe myn hûn net wêze.
I thought you knew your stuff	Ik tocht dat jo jo dingen wisten
They do not work together.	Se wurkje net tegearre.
I wonder who made it and why	Ik freegje my ôf wa't it makke hat en wêrom
But he could really get to you.	Mar hy koe echt krije ta dy.
Not that the two are very different, actually.	Net dat de twa binne hiel oars, eins.
There, I actually agree with her	Dêr bin ik it eins mei har iens
It was not that it hurt him.	It wie net dat it him sear die.
I want to talk about that	Dêr wol ik it oer ha
We have  .	Wy hawwe .
Not until he got there.	Net oant er dêr kaam.
She should have done it.	Se hie it dwaan moatten.
Nothing is ever to do with me in this house.	Neat is ea mei my te meitsjen yn dit hûs.
I wonder if he still has them.	Ik freegje my ôf oft er se noch hat.
The problem is that they are nothing of the sort.	It probleem is dat se neat fan it soarte binne.
She thinks of you.	Se tinkt oan dy.
I have to find her, he said to himself	Ik moat har fine, sei er tsjin himsels
It's the past.	It is it ferline.
He did not look at me.	Hy seach my net oan.
We will help you as much as you help us.	Wy sille jo helpe safolle as jo ús helpe.
I'm worried about you	ik meitsje my soargen om dy
And not without reason.	En net sûnder reden.
I had to get to this place	Ik moast op dit plak komme
If you find nothing, come back here tomorrow at this hour.	As jo ​​neat fine, kom hjir moarn op dit oere werom.
They do it with me.	Se dogge it mei my.
I visit that place every day	Ik besykje dat plak alle dagen
I think we have time to look into it	Ik tink dat wy tiid hawwe om der nei te sjen
That there is nothing else.	Dat der neat oars is.
It went on and on.	It gie troch en troch.
I was really good at it	Ik wie der echt goed yn
These are not hard to get.	Dizze binne net dreech te krijen.
I can not think of you either	Ik kin ek net oan dy tinke
What you need !.	Wat jo nedich hawwe!.
One has a mother.	En har mem.
And no one saw.	En gjinien seach.
That's what I heard there.	Dat hearde ik dêr.
I fed her and she stayed back	Ik joech har iten en se bleau werom

I have enough money to buy them.	Ik haw genôch jild om se te keapjen.
I can not say that word.	Ik kin dat wurd net sizze.
All well and good.	Alles goed en goed.
I will find them when we return.	Ik sil se fine as wy werom binne.
No one got in trouble both days.	Gjinien kaam beide dagen yn de problemen.
I do not know exactly what to say.	Ik wit net krekt wat te sizzen.
You will love him.	Jo sille fan him hâlde.
She liked it too.	Se mocht it ek graach.
I would just live there from now on	Dêr soe ik fan no ôf gewoan wenje
And got to see where he lived.	En krige te sjen wêr't er wenne.
I love working for you	Ik wurkje graach foar dy
I still can not believe he did that	Ik kin it noch net leauwe dat er dat dien hat
It can do a lot, but nothing really good.	It kin in protte dwaan, mar neat echt goed.
It's never one guy.	It is nea ien keardel.
What happened last year will not happen again.	Wat ferline jier bard is, sil net wer barre.
Come and see me again.	Kom en sjoch my wer.
I'm not nice.	Ik bin net aardich.
I think he knows it and that they are not good	Ik tink dat hy it wit en dat se net goed binne
It would be good to get better at it, he thought.	It soe goed wêze om dêr better yn te wurden, tocht er.
I, wish she had not	Ik, woe dat se net hie
Or maybe it does not.	Of miskien docht it net.
So did she.	Dat sei se ek.
I hope there is nothing wrong with me	Ik hoopje dat der neat mei my is
I will not take any more of your time	Ik sil net mear fan jo tiid nimme
She was sure she could keep them both together.	Se wie der wis fan dat se har beide mei elkoar hâlde koene.
He does what he says.	Hy docht wat er seit.
This just will not do.	Dit sil gewoan net dwaan.
There must be something else.	Der moat wat oars.
And he would not eat them.	En hy woe har net ite.
There were no people around.	Der wiene gjin minsken om.
Man, you have to go for it.	Man, jo moatte der foar gean.
He would even go.	Hy soe sels gean.
What about.	Wat oer.

I thought the police were coming	Ik tocht dat de plysje kaam
Not enough money.	Net genôch jild.
I just feel better about having it with me	Ik fiel my gewoan better om it mei my te hawwen
Such a man did not ask what he wanted	Sa'n man frege net wat er woe
A better school, maybe.	In bettere skoalle, miskien.
What to do?.	Wat te dwaan?.
I had to see him, one last time	Ik moast him sjen, in lêste kear
It does not matter what you have to say.	It makket neat út wat jo te sizzen hawwe.

She can not love me.	Se kin net fan my hâlde.
We have big problems here.	Wy hawwe hjir grutte problemen.
I would get nothing else from them	Ik soe neat oars út har krije
I like to eat a lot.	Ik mei graach in protte ite.
We can not get out of there.	Wy kinne der net út.

Nobody really did it.	Nimmen die it echt.
I do not know her.	Ik wit har net.
They really love each other.	Se hâlde echt fan elkoar.
I will not let this happen	Ik sil dit net barre litte
I know everyone is different	Ik wit dat elkenien oars is

Have more than you want.	Hawwe mear as jo wolle.
We talk about our past.	Wy prate mei ús ferline.
I asked him my name.	Ik frege him myn namme.
She did not say whether she agreed or not.	Se sei net oft se it iens wie of net.
I actually work all the time	Ik wurkje eins de hiele tiid
It's still beautiful without it.	It is noch altyd moai sûnder it.
I want her and my dad too	Ik wol har en myn heit ek
I'll tell the truth	Ik sil de wierheid fertelle
I'm so glad to see him.	Ik bin sa bliid om him te sjen.
They want a dog.	Se wolle in hûn.

And she was always happy to see me.	En se wie altyd bliid om my te sjen.
See, this was just after.	Sjoch, dit wie krekt nei.
It was late in the evening.	It wie let op 'e jûn.
Well, let's go.	No, lit ús gean.
I'll leave you all about it	Ik sil jo der alles oer litte
He knew his job.	Hy koe syn wurk.
I love this work.	Ik hâld fan dit wurk.
I do not agree with that	Dêr bin ik it net mei iens
I feel like a week was enough	Ik fiel dat in wike genôch wie
There must be something of that too.	Dêr moat ek wat fan wêze.
I will not talk to him anymore	Ik sil net mear mei him prate
I let them go.	Ik liet se gean.
I did not know what he would do	Ik wist net wat er dwaan soe
I'm having a hard time with it.	Ik bin der dreech mei.
That was not her problem.	Dat wie har probleem net.
To not hurt.	Om net sear te dwaan.
I tried to talk to him.	Ik besocht mei him te praten.
I love what they do.	Ik hâld fan wat se dogge.
This is up to you.	Dit is oan dy.
I actually have to go home	Ik moat eins nei hûs
I'm looking forward to it	ik sjoch der nei út
I want to know everything about him	Ik wol alles oer him witte
Go and do it.	Gean en doch it.
I tried for two years	Ik besocht foar twa jier
They are not children.	It binne gjin bern.
Tell me what happened to you.	Fertel my wat der mei dy bard is.
It just may not be true	It kin gewoan net wier wêze
I made him for this time	Ik makke him foar dizze tiid
He said some things.	Hy sei wat dingen.
It's not how we think today.	It is net hoe't wy hjoed tinke.
I really did not want to know	Ik woe it eins net witte

I love him.	Ik hâld fan him.
I'm sure you are not.	Ik bin der wis fan dat dy net is.
You can ask him about anything.	Jo kinne him oer alles freegje.
We've never met her before.	Wy hawwe har nea earder moete.
I took the money out	Ik naam it jild út
I have not heard from her for almost two years	Ik haw al hast twa jier neat fan har heard
No one came home.	Gjinien kaam thús.
Where exactly does not matter.	Wêr krekt makket neat út.
This is my work so far.	Dit is myn wurk oant no ta.
The young man is out of school.	De jonge man is út skoalle.
I'm ok.	It giet goed mei my.
If there is no one left.	As der gjinien mear oer is.
There's enough reason.	It is genôch reden.
I waited, and waited	Ik wachte, en wachte
I sit for hours like that	Ik sit wat oeren liket
We will visit you.	Wy sille jo besykje.
Ask for help.	Frege har om help.
I really want to do this	Ik wol dit echt dwaan
I felt tired again.	Ik fielde my wer wurch.
Not for the money.	Net foar it jild.
Talk to your parents.	Praat mei dyn âlden.
This is not mine.	Dit is net fan my.
I knew right away where we were	Ik wist fuort wêr't wy wiene
I need to know what's going on with me	Ik moat witte wat der mei my bart
I think we should go see	Ik tink dat wy gean moatte sjen
I know he tried to take me	Ik wit dat hy besocht my te nimmen
There were people around me.	Der wiene minsken om my hinne.
Much better than me.	Folle better as my.
These are beautiful.	Dizze binne moai.
And we can not do that.	En dat kinne wy ​​net dwaan.
And if that makes me a bad person.	En as dat makket my in min persoan.
I did not go to school	Ik gie net nei skoalle
We're leaving in an hour.	Wy komme oer in oere fuort.
Of course they did.	Dat diene se fansels.
One was his.	Ien wie syn.
Just give me one penny.	Jou my mar ien jild.
Of course I did not say	Ik sei fansels net
This idea will not work.	Dit idee sil net wurkje.
I can not believe this	Ik kin dit net leauwe
There's one more thing.	Der is noch ien ding.
You say they told you.	Jo sizze seine dy.
Let's stop there and move on to another question.	Litte wy dêr ophâlde en nei in oare fraach gean.
If they had not been, they would be today.	As se net west hiene, soene se hjoed wêze.
I would have been surprised if she finished it all	Ik soe west hawwe ferrast as se klear it allegear
I asked her how she felt	Ik frege har hoe't se har fielde
I did not expect this	Ik hie dit net ferwachte
I know what's coming.	Ik wit wat der komt.
They do nothing.	Se meitsje neat.
I hope you can be here	Ik hoopje dat jo hjir wêze kinne
And very soon.	En hiel gau.
I still believe that.	Dat leau ik noch.
I could not get out of the house.	Ik koe it hûs net út.
It worked well.	It hat goed wurke.
But there had to be a way.	Mar der moast in wei komme.
I would do anything to get her back	Ik soe alles dwaan om har werom te krijen
It's not that hard.	It is net sa dreech.
I do not know what happened.	Ik wit net wat der bard is.
I quit my job and left	Ik liet myn baan op en gie
That might be a little better of a word.	Dat kin in bytsje better fan in wurd.
I know how much you want this	Ik wit hoefolle jo dit wolle
I would never do that to you	Dat soe ik dy noait dwaan
I never wanted anyone more	Ik hie nea immen mear woe
I would never let you down	Ik soe dy noait ea litte litte
I asked her what happened	Ik frege har wat der bard is
I had them all three well	Ik hie se alle trije wol
I wanted the other guy	Ik woe de oare keardel
I know what happened	Ik wit wat der bard is
But it was still family.	Mar it wie noch famylje.
We can take better care of our home.	Wy kinne better foar ús hûs soargje.
I wanted to see it for myself	Ik woe it sels sjen
I did not know what else to do.	Ik wist net wat ik oars dwaan moast.
I was ready for one thing after another	Ik wie klear op ien ding nei
I did not expect this	Ik hie dit net ferwachte
I do not know if it still works or not	Ik wit net oft it noch wurket of net
I came here from work	Ik kaam hjir fan 'e baan
I have always found it such a beautiful book	Ik haw it altyd sa'n moai boek fûn
I have work to do for you.	Ik haw wurk foar jo te dwaan.
There was something wrong with her.	Der wie wat oan dat se net mocht.
But one thing bothered her.	Mar ien ding gie har oan.
He is your father.	Hy is dyn heit.
I think the girl should be about one or two	Ik tink dat it famke oer ien of twa wêze moat
I heard all about it	Ik hearde der alles oer
You do not have much time.	Jo hawwe net folle tiid.
These are now ready.	Dy binne no klear.
That was one way of saying it.	Dat wie ien manier om it te sizzen.
A beautiful girl	In moai famke
I did a lot today.	Ik haw hjoed in protte dien.
I had to make it back	Ik moast it werom meitsje
We'll show you.	Wy sille it dy sjen litte.
A few did that.	In pear diene dat.
I was not good at talking to other people	Ik wie net goed yn praten mei oare minsken
Or maybe they do.	Of miskien dogge se.
I did not stay	Ik bleau net sjen
I do not even like the word.	Ik hâld net iens fan it wurd.
And that must be me.	En dy moat ik wêze.
I thought we were friends	Ik tocht dat wy freonen wiene
Now they both knew.	No wisten se beide.
Not even my mother.	Net iens myn mem.
I never heard from him again	Ik hearde nea wer fan him
They do not stop.	Se hâlde net op.
I hope he's back soon	Ik hoopje dat hy gau werom is
I believe he is not working.	Ik leau dat hy net wurket.
This, right here.	Dit, krekt hjir.
He must love his children.	Hy moat fan syn bern hâlde.
It just does not.	It docht gewoan net.
That really worries us.	Dat makket ús echt soargen.
He had to find her.	Hy moast har fine.
I love you both.	Ik hâld fan dy beide.
I will not be able to stop	Ik sil net ophâlde kinne
And let me just do it this way.	En lit my it gewoan op dizze manier dwaan.
I can not do without him	Ik kin net sûnder him
I'm probably a dog person	Ik bin nei alle gedachten in hûn persoan
And look at that.	En sjoch dat.
I love you, mind you	Ik hâld fan dy, tink
I had no idea what was going on inside them	Ik hie gjin idee wat der yn har kaam wie
I wanted to do something that scared me.	Ik woe wat dwaan dat my bang makke.
You have to see it.	Jo moatte it sjen.
I can only let go.	Ik kin my mar gean litte.
Do what you have to do.	Doch wat jo moatte dwaan.
But she never told.	Mar se hat nea ferteld.
I know everything now.	Ik wit no alles.
I wanted to be these things	Ik woe dizze dingen wêze
He was just.	Hy wie gewoan.
I did it all for you	Ik die it allegear foar dy
And truly, he had every reason to do so.	En wier, hy hie alle reden om dat te dwaan.
You have to tell me the truth.	Jo moatte my de wierheid fertelle.
It was getting late now.	It waard no let.
I thought maybe everything would be fine	Ik tocht dat miskien alles wol goed wêze soe
I did not know it was so late	Ik wist net dat it sa let wie
I feel much better.	Ik fiel my folle better.
The question was how to get it.	De fraach wie hoe te krijen it.
I can not wait forever.	Ik kin net foar altyd wachtsje.
I was afraid of what they would ask me to do	Ik wie bang wat se my soene freegje om te dwaan
I look at him like my dog	Ik sjoch him oan as myn hûn
This time he would do everything right.	Dizze kear soe hy alles goed dwaan.
I can not agree with that now	Dêr kin ik no net mei
I wonder what she thinks	Ik freegje my ôf wat se tinkt
But we are not there yet.	Mar wy binne der noch net.
We have to go with him.	Wy moatte mei him gean.
I just wanted him to love me	Ik woe gewoan dat hy fan my hâlde
I knew what they were going to do with it	Ik wist wat se mei har dwaan soene
I wanted more of you	Ik woe mear fan dy
I wonder if we can do it	Ik freegje my ôf oft wy it kinne
So few of us there now.	Sa'n pear fan ús dêr no.
I wanted him badly in me.	Ik woe him min yn my.
We had a very good time.	Wy hiene in hiel goede tiid.
Let him want more.	Lit him mear wolle.
Maybe that was hope talk.	Miskien wie dat hope praten.
She almost told him she would go home soon.	Se fertelde him hast dat se gau nei hûs gean soe.
It was not too much, or too little.	It wie net te folle, of te min.
I have no idea what happened.	Ik ha gjin idee wat der bard is.
We did that for a year.	Dat hawwe wy in jier dien.
We are tired.	Wy binne wurch.
I want to see him at work	Ik wol him oan it wurk sjen
But we can.	Mar wy kinne.
Everyone wants one.	Elkenien wol ien.
He made them work hard at it.	Hy liet se der hurd oan wurkje.
I will probably spend my whole life in school	Ik sil nei alle gedachten myn hiele libben op skoalle
I better get back to the party	Ik kin better werom nei it feest
It seems to me more of the same.	It liket my mear fan itselde.
I thought his words were very clear and precise	Ik tocht dat syn wurden heul dúdlik en krekt wiene
I thought it best not to wake you up.	Ik fûn it it bêste om dy net wekker te meitsjen.
She does not do that too much.	Dat docht se net al te folle.
More than bad.	Mear as min.
I can not find what is happening	Ik kin net fine wat der bart
I could not leave you like that	Ik koe dy net sa litte
We do not know if they will ever return.	Wy witte net oft se oait werom komme.
I asked what was going on	Ik frege wat der oan de hân wie
The water felt good.	It wetter fielde goed.
I want to do what he wants me to do	Ik wol dwaan wat er my wol
So she kept asking for food.	Sa bleau se om iten freegje.
Want it, have it, want it have it.	Wolle dit, hawwe dit, wolle dit hawwe dit.
It will be .	It sil wêze .
It's too old.	It is al te âld.
But it will be.	Mar it sil wêze.
I wanted to do it all myself	Ik woe it allegear sels dwaan
And my family.	En myn famylje.
I just can not believe it	Ik kin it gewoan net leauwe
Even if she could find better.	Ek al koe se better fine.
I had no problem with that	Dêr hie ik gjin probleem mei
I'm coming home late tonight, or early tomorrow.	Ik kom fannacht let thús, of moarn betiid.
But, that does not matter.	Mar, dat makket neat út.
I was happy for her, but that was not my thing	Ik wie bliid foar har, mar dat wie net myn ding
I will be there in no time	Ik sil der yn gjin tiid wêze
I did not really think it could be you	Ik tocht net echt dat it dy wêze koe
It should have been my life.	It hie myn libben wêze moatten.
I was just not sure why.	Ik wie gewoan net wis wêrom.
He had heard it as a child.	Hy hie it as bern heard.
I had done nothing to help him in the past	Ik hie neat dien om him yn it ferline te helpen
I've been waiting.	Ik ha wachte.
You have to go something.	Jo moatte wat gean.
I should have been with her	Ik hie by har wêze moatten
They have the past.	Se hawwe it ferline.
She was not there.	Se wie der net.
We knew he had done it.	Wy wisten dat hy it dien hie.
I did not want her to die on me again	Ik woe net dat se wer op my stoar
He should not come here.	Hy moat hjir net komme.
Maybe, he thought.	Miskien, tocht er.
That could be true though.	Dat koe wol wier wêze.
He just could not stand it.	Hy koe it gewoan net oan.
They were friends.	Se wiene freonen.
But there was no going back now.	Mar der wie no gjin mear werom.
It's a lot like a family.	It liket in protte op in famylje.
I will be going back here soon	Ik sil hjir gau werom gean
That would be best.	Dat soe it bêste wêze.
He does not look after me and my children.	Hy sjocht net nei my en myn bern.
I just needed a teacher	Ik hie gewoan in learaar nedich
One is just plain.	Ien is gewoan gewoan.
A lot of people have just never heard of it	In protte minsken hawwe der gewoan noait fan heard
We convinced her to come out.	Wy hawwe har oertsjûge om út te kommen.
I did not want to hurt him	Ik woe him net sear dwaan
Same with me.	Itselde mei my.
I think it's going well	Ik tink dat it goed komt

I love talking to him	Ik hâld fan praten mei him
Do not worry, this will work.	Sit gjin soargen, dit sil wurkje.
What we do not know is whether it is actually made.	Wat wy net witte oft it eins wurdt makke.
There is so much more for us.	D'r is safolle mear foar ús.
I told her she did not have to do that	Ik fertelde har dat se dat net hoegde te dwaan
I'm still at work.	Ik bin noch oan it wurk.
I just bought one to see what it was like	Ik kocht ien gewoan om te sjen hoe't it wie
Why are we not surprised ?.	Wêrom binne wy ​​net ferrast?.
Love the idea.	Hâld fan it idee.
I did not come up much in those days.	Ik kaam yn dy dagen net folle op.
No one had much money.	Net ien hie folle jild.
I have worked so hard for it	Ik ha der sa hurd foar wurke
And we just know who they did it to.	En wy witte gewoan wa't se it dien hawwe.
Let it not be too soon.	Lit it net te gau wêze.
I was hurt and angry	Ik wie sear en lilk
But it could be done.	Mar it koe dien wurde.
I need to talk to you about something	Ik moat wat mei dy prate
Now I can talk to you about everything.	No kin ik oer alles mei dy prate.
Enough has been said about him.	Der is genôch oer him sein.
On its own, it's good.	Op himsels is it goed.
Just away.	Gewoan fuort.
He did not know what to say.	Hy wist net wat te sizzen.
She wanted me to help her find you.	Se woe dat ik har helpe jo te finen.
I can not believe he's here	Ik kin net leauwe dat hy hjir is
I agree with him.	Ik mei wol oer him.
I was not always like that	Ik wie net altyd sa
I do not know, that is a very good question.	Ik wit it net, dat is in hiel goede fraach.
And he actually just.	En hy die eins net.
I could not go back now	Ik koe no net werom
They're in town now.	Se binne no yn 'e stêd.
The other woman in her class was her mother.	De oare frou yn har klasse wie har mem.
But, he surprises me.	Mar, hy ferrast my.
He kept looking around.	Hy bleau om him hinne te sjen.
I could see where she was coming from.	Ik koe sjen wêr't se wei kaam.
I asked myself to see everything that happened	Ik frege my ôf om alles te sjen dat barde
But now it was different.	Mar no wie it oars.
I was quite clear	Ik wie hielendal dúdlik
He will believe everything.	Hy sil alles leauwe.
I will not take any chances	Ik sil gjin kâns meitsje
I will never regret it	Dêr sil ik noait spyt fan ha
I see where you're coming from.	Ik sjoch wêr't jo wei komme.
And he will not now.	En hy sil no net.
I did not intend to do that	Ik wie net fan plan dat te dwaan
My husband has been too hard on everyone lately.	Myn man is de lêste tiid te hurd foar elkenien.
I wanted to too, of course	Ik woe ek fansels
I got a wife and kids and they come first.	Ik krige in frou en bern en se komme earst.
I will always be there	Ik sil der altyd wêze
You have to make it yourself.	Jo moatte it sels meitsje.
Not really true.	Net echt wier.
After what we just saw.	Nei wat wy krekt sjoen hawwe.
I could only see him all day	Ik koe him de hiele dei mar sjen
She was not what she seemed to be.	Se wie net wat se like te wêzen.
If you take it, you will pay, believe me.	As jo ​​it nimme, sille jo betelje, leau my.
You will not be able to make a little more.	Jo sille net kinne meitsje in bytsje mear.
I did not know him, and he did not know me	Ik koe him net, en hy koe my net
He wanted it.	Hy woe it wol.

I also have so many questions	Ik haw ek safolle fragen
We need to do more.	Wy moatte mear dwaan.
He was no longer afraid of the truth.	Hy wie net mear bang foar de wierheid.
I thought nothing of it	Ik tocht der neat oer

I can no longer stand her	Ik kin har net mear oan
I look after my family and friends	Ik sjoch nei myn famylje en freonen
I'm going away right away	Ik gean fuort fuort
Maybe something good would come of everything that happened.	Miskien soe der wat goed komme fan alles wat bard wie.
The bed can be too.	It bêd kin ek wêze.
I never had it easy.	Ik hie it noait maklik.
I must have done something wrong	Ik moat wat ferkeard dien hawwe
It was a worrying time.	It wie in soargen tiid.
I know they are talking about me.	Ik wit dat se it oer my hawwe.
She's not coming back.	Se komt net werom.
In truth, he did not even look angry.	Yn wierheid seach er net iens lilk út.
I could not even hold the water	Ik koe it wetter net iens hâlde
He looked at me, looked at him.	Hy seach my oan, seach him oan.
There needs to be more.	Der moatte mear wêze.
Nobody talks to me in the office.	Nimmen praat mei my op it kantoar.
I'm sure of that	Ik haw der wis fan makke

I ask nothing of you	Ik freegje neat fan dy

I knew why he wanted to be in the house.	Ik wist wêrom't er yn 'e hûs woe.
I did not like him.	Ik mocht him net.
We have no time.	Wy hawwe gjin tiid.
But nothing like what is happening now.	Mar neat as wat der no bart.
Now, let's show how much we can do.	No, lit ús sjen hoefolle wy kinne dwaan.
Please be good.	Wês asjebleaft goed.
He knew he was wrong.	Hy wist dat er ferkeard wie.
She never wanted to be anything other than a girl.	Se woe nea oars wêze as in famke.
He had hurt her.	Hy hie har sear dien.
Well, she knew it was not her.	Goed, se wist dat it har net wie.
I can not say a word to you	Ik kin dy gjin wurd sizze
Love this thing.	Hâld fan dit ding.
She does what she has to do to stay alive.	Se docht wat se moat om yn libben te bliuwen.
And so we knew.	En sa wisten wy.
It was not easy to find.	It wie net maklik te finen.
It's probably out of hand when you're seen.	It is wierskynlik út 'e hân as jo sjoen wurde.

I was afraid she would scare me to stay	Ik wie bang dat se my bang meitsje soe om te bliuwen
Same as a woman.	Itselde as in frou.
What they might have had.	Wat se miskien hiene.
It was clear he wanted to get away from us.	It wie dúdlik dat hy fan ús ôf woe.
I did not want to get into trouble anymore.	Ik woe net mear yn de problemen komme.
I thought about it, and felt sick	Ik tocht der oer, en fielde my siik
She looked back into the room.	Se seach werom de keamer yn.
I'm really happy for you	Ik bin echt bliid foar dy
He needs to find another alarm clock.	Hy moat in oare wekker fine.
Looking forward to seeing you there !.	Sjoch út nei sjoch dy dêr!.
The dog was there.	De hûn wie der.
But then again.	Mar dan wer.
I just wanted to get out of there	Ik woe der mar út
You can not see a bit of the bad place.	Jo kinne net sjen in bytsje fan it minne plak.
I do not want him to come and see me	Ik wol net dat er my komt sjen
I will stop.	Ik sil ophâlde.
This was a house for people.	Dit wie in hûs foar minsken.
I should have been with him, as a friend	Ik hie by him wêze moatten, as in freon
If you can, wait until you get back here.	As jo ​​​​kinne, wachtsje oant jo hjir werom komme.
I wanted him to say something	Ik woe dat er wat sei
I did not even have a car yet	Ik hie noch net iens in auto
From what you have done.	Fan wat jo dien hawwe.
And then all is well.	En dan alles goed mar.
There were only two people left	Der wiene noch mar twa minsken oer
They are given here.	Se wurde hjir jûn.
I was very happy with everything	Ik wie heul bliid mei alles
I talk to my mom almost every day	Ik praat hast alle dagen mei myn mem
I looked around and did not see his car	Ik seach om my hinne en seach syn auto net
You have a year.	Jo hawwe in jier.
It's just getting old to me.	It wurdt my gewoan âld.
We've done this before.	Dat ha wy earder dien.
This is song two.	Dit is liet twa.
I did not need her to need me	Ik hie har net nedich om my nedich te hawwen
I had to.	Ik moast.
I hope they had a good time	Ik hoopje dat se in goede tiid hiene
I told you it was okay	Ik sei dy dat it goed wie
This will not be fun.	Dit sil net leuk wurde.
I could not get there sooner	Ik koe der net earder komme
I feel nothing for myself	Ik fiel neat foar my
I'm not coming back.	Ik kom net werom.
That's my day job.	Dat is myn dei wurk.
It does not work for me.	It wurket net foar my.
I did not even have time to talk to her	Ik hie net iens de tiid om mei har te praten
The reason is clear.	De reden is dúdlik.
Feel free to stay a bit and look around you !.	Fiel jo frij om in bytsje te bliuwen en om jo hinne te sjen!.
I can say things without saying them	Ik kin dingen sizze sûnder se te sizzen
That was not her now.	Dat wie se no net.
I asked her if she felt well	Ik frege har oft se fielde goed
I think you'll be fine.	Ik tink dat jo goed komme.
I had to keep it all the way home	Ik moast it hielendal nei hûs hâlde
I did not have it either	Ik hie it ek net
I do not want to know if she is the best for me.	Ik wol net witte oft se it bêste foar my is.
I do not believe saying anything is wrong	Ik leau net sizze neat is ferkeard
I really do not believe he would do that	Ik leau echt net dat hy dat dwaan soe
I looked at her closely	Ik seach har goed oan
You know, well and good, that's not the case.	Jo witte goed en goed, dat is net sa.
Do the same for him	Doch itselde foar him
I never really went out that much	Ik gie noait echt sa folle út
We do a lot of the first ones.	Wy dogge in protte fan 'e earste.
I did not like this at all	Ik mocht dit hielendal net
And he's at work now.	En hy is no oan it wurk.
I knew you were not ready for all this	Ik wist dat jo net klear wiene foar dit alles
That was what we expected from him.	Dat hiene wy ​​fan him ferwachte.
You must try.	Jo moatte besykje.
He still did not think well.	Hy tocht noch net goed.
But she had already been nice enough.	Mar se hie al aardich genôch west.
Everyone should agree.	Elkenien soe it iens wêze moatte.
It was not my job, it was not my family.	It wie net myn wurk, it wie net myn famylje.
He did not like life there at all.	Hy mocht it libben dêr hielendal net.
I never expected to give up my kids	Ik hie noait ferwachte myn bern op te jaan
I don't know.	Ik wit it net.
I believe you can do it.	Ik leau dat jo it kinne.
I never thought that would happen.	Ik hie noait tocht dat dat barre soe.
Come on kids.	Kom op bern.
The water was off, but it had probably been on before.	It wetter wie ôf, mar it hie nei alle gedachten earder op west.
In fact, it seems to me just fine.	Eins liket dit my krekt goed.
From time to time.	Fan tiid ta tiid.
I just can not think that way	Ik kin gewoan net op dy manier tinke
I had no idea how to do that	Ik hie gjin idee hoe't ik dat dwaan moast
It would not even be that difficult.	It soe net iens sa dreech wêze.
I need to show you something	Ik moat dy wat sjen litte
I did not arrive here on time	Ik kaam hjir net op tiid
We should not take anything for granted.	Wy moatte neat foar fansels nimme.
You had to let him go.	Do moast him gean litte.
He will give you the hand.	Hy sil jo de hân jaan.
I will take them one by one	Ik sil se ien foar ien nimme
They could look like anything.	Se koene op alles lykje.
I really love your work	Ik hâld echt fan jo wurk
Somehow they do.	Op ien of oare manier dogge se dat.
Maybe she made friends with it.	Miskien makke se der freonen mei.
I would not get there on time	Ik soe der net op tiid komme
And it's hard to make it right.	En it is dreech om it goed te meitsjen.
Things were different now.	Dingen wiene no oars.
They knew who we were.	Se wisten wa't wy wiene.
I thought of the one who wanted the beast too	Ik tocht oan dejinge dy't it bist ek woe
Anything, anything, good can happen now.	Alles, alles, goed kin no barre.
You can see this better.	Jo kinne dit better sjen.
I did not know exactly what	Ik wist net wat krekt
You might think so too.	Jo kinne it ek sa tinke.
That money is gone now.	Dat jild is no fuort.
More about me here.	Mear oer my hjir.
I was always different	Ik wie altyd oars
Then we work again.	Dan wurkje wy wer.
It just did not work for me.	It wurke gewoan net foar my.
Now there are two.	No binne der twa.
And she's very clear about this	En se is hjir hiel dúdlik oer
I've always liked you	Ik haw dy altyd leuk fûn
And talk to no one.	En prate mei gjinien.
I can do nothing more	Ik kin neat mear oan
I could not say how much.	Ik koe net sizze hoefolle.
So would we.	Dat soene wy ​​ek.
Believe me, it will not happen again.	Leau my, it sil net wer barre.
I'm fine with all this	Ik bin goed mei dit alles
Did nothing.	Hat neat dien.
They wait an hour.	Se wachtsje in oere.
He has a good reason for doing it.	Hy hat in goede reden om it te dwaan.
A very nice thing.	In hiel moai ding.
I liked how much he loved his family	Ik mocht graach hoefolle hy fan syn famylje hâlde
Maybe she was just tired.	Miskien wie se gewoan wurch.
The family did not have much money at that time	De famylje hie yn dizze tiid net folle jild
It was old.	It wie âld.
And everyone does.	En elkenien docht.
I have no time.	Ik haw gjin tiid.
I know we ask a lot	Ik wit dat wy in protte freegje
I had not eaten since	Ik hie sûnt net iten
I just came out to shake hands	Ik kaam krekt út om in hân te jaan
And now this one, which had to be his best yet.	En no dizze, dy't syn bêste noch wêze moast.
A good job.	In goede baan.
Better to go without it.	Better te gean sûnder it.
I'm sure of it now.	Ik bin der no wis fan.
Even they would agree.	Sels soene se it iens wêze.
And she can not find a man.	En se kin gjin man fine.
I myself like to play in it	Ik sels spylje der graach yn
You saw nothing.	Do hast neat sjoen.
I will show a picture of the problem.	Ik sil in foto fan it probleem sjen litte.
There had to be more to it than that.	Der moast mear by wêze as dat.
I will try to be a good man	Ik sil besykje in goede man te wêzen
The house is yours, and so is everything else.	It hûs is fan jo, en sa is al it oare.
I could tell he did not see it	Ik koe sizze dat hy it net seach
I wish it was over.	Ik woe dat it oer wie.
We need a reason.	Wy hawwe in reden nedich.
I believe there are many things we should not know.	Ik leau dat d'r in protte dingen binne dy't wy net moatte witte.
I told my mom too	Ik fertelde myn mem ek
I guess it was not much of an idea	Ik nim oan dat it net folle fan in idee wie
I'm going to make a place for you	Ik gean om in plak foar jo te meitsjen
Everyone knew who it was.	Elkenien wist wa't it wie.
This is just that book.	Dit is net dat boek.
I'll let them know	Ik sil se witte litte
He knows everything about us.	Hy wit alles oer ús.
It's time.	It wurd tiid.
They remain good friends.	Se bliuwe goede freonen.
Come see me in a week or so.	Kom sjoch my oer in wike as wat.
Ask to see her.	Fragen om har te sjen.
A man should not love a woman so much	In man moat net sa folle fan in frou hâlde
We'm getting through.	Wy komme troch.
I would have thought she would have done something different	Ik soe tocht hawwe dat se wat oars dien hawwe soe
As if she does not think of you.	As tinkt se dy net.
I could not wait until this morning came	Ik koe net wachtsje oant dizze moarn kaam
I need her.	Ik haw har nedich.
I hope you like it	Ik hoopje dat jo it leuk fine
I almost see her in the water	Ik sjoch har hast yn it wetter
Then there is the problem of water.	Dan is der it probleem fan wetter.
Many people do not.	In protte minsken net.
I have no idea how to go about this.	Ik haw gjin idee hoe te gean oer dit.
I think it would be fun	Ik tink dat it wol leuk wêze soe
I did not think we would ever be found	Ik tocht net dat wy oait fûn wurde soene
She could not.	Se koe it net.
And this photo.	En dizze foto.
Please, please come for me.	Asjebleaft, kom asjebleaft foar my.
I thought we did it really well.	Ik tocht dat wy it echt goed diene.
Nothing for any of us.	Neat foar ien fan ús.
I know now that there are things	Ik wit no dat der dingen binne
Probably would not work for you.	Wierskynlik soe net wurkje foar dy.
Starting in the morning.	Fan 'e moarn ôf.
So it's just here.	Sa is it hjir gewoan.
I know you already knew this	Ik wit dat jo dit al wisten
It was so fun when he did.	It wie sa leuk doe't hy die.
I need you here with me	Ik haw dy hjir by my nedich
That has been.	Dat hat west.
I want to think about this and that	Ik wol tinke oer dit en dy
I would do the time.	Ik soe de tiid dwaan.
And they did, of course.	En dat diene se, fansels.
We need to take care of this bad guy.	Wy moatte foar dizze minne keardel soargje.
I would get in trouble otherwise.	Ik soe oars yn de problemen komme.
I did not know how to get his money back	Ik wist net hoe't ik syn jild werom moast
Of course not now.	Fansels net no.
I really think it would help you	Ik tink echt dat it jo soe helpe
I expected it would do.	Ik ferwachte dat it soe dwaan.
I'm really looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der eins út nei te sjen.
You can see where this is going.	Jo kinne sjen wêr't dit hinne giet.
We just have to wait for them.	Wy moatte gewoan dat se wachtsje.
He could not believe how good it felt.	Hy koe net leauwe hoe goed it fielde.
I was just kept in a house.	Ik waard gewoan yn in hûs hâlden.
About your mother.	Oer dyn mem.
I wondered how he felt today	Ik frege my ôf hoe't hy him hjoed fielde
It happened just a few months ago.	It barde mar in pear moanne lyn.
Something would happen.	Der soe wat barre.
You need to know what you want from life.	Jo moatte witte wat jo wolle fan it libben.
And for nothing.	En foar neat.
I did not do it to hurt you.	Ik haw it net dien om dy sear te dwaan.
I was always more worried about you	Ik wie altyd mear soargen oer dy
I could talk to them in another week	Ik koe se yn in oare wike prate
And it looks like that.	En it sjocht der út.
I was once like you, a child	Ik wie eartiids as dy, in bern
So were we.	Dat wiene wy ​​ek.
I can not stay with you.	Ik kin net by dy bliuwe.
I did not hurt anyone.	Ik die nimmen sear.
May be there.	Mei der wêze.
They did not need my help.	Se hiene myn help net nedich.
I know you must be very busy.	Ik wit dat jo it tige drok hawwe moatte.
In the movie, it's the mother.	Yn de film is it de mem.
I'm just me.	Ik bin gewoan ik.
That does not seem too good to me.	Dat liket my net al te goed.
I should have known this was how it would go	Ik hie witte moatten dat dit wie hoe't it gean soe
Not so fast.	Net sa gau.
They would still have questions.	Se soene noch fragen hân hawwe.
I think he's fine.	Ik tink dat hy goed is.
I think they're pretty good at it	Ik tink dat se der aardich goed fan binne
We are so sorry.	It spyt ús sa.
I can not wait to see it done	Ik kin net wachtsje om it dien te sjen
It's my belief that she never has.	It is myn leauwe dat se noait hat.
I need to do something.	Ik moat wat dwaan.
I know you would do that anyway	Ik wit dat jo dat hoe dan ek dwaan soene
I did not know what to do	Ik wist net wat ik dwaan moast
Mine look exactly like that too.	Myn lykje der ek krekt op.
A young woman looks up	In jonge frou sjocht
She would see, then she looked away as if she had seen nothing.	Se soe sjen, dan seach se fuort as hie se neat sjoen.
I was not the one who did any of these things	Ik wie net dejinge dy't ien fan dizze dingen die
I did not want all this	Ik woe dit alles net
I had to get this right.	Ik moast dit goed krije.
It was also true.	It wie ek wier.
I just want to be free	Ik wol gewoan frij wêze
I should have stayed to help you	Ik hie bliuwe moatten om jo te helpen
If you were any of it so.	As jo ​​wiene wat fan it sa.
He would give her enough time.	Hy soe har genôch tiid jaan.
Well, actually do not like him of course.	No, eins net fan him hâlde fansels.
I was already thinking about that	Dêr tocht ik al oan
But he was too different from her.	Mar hy wie te oars as har.
I said nothing	Ik sei neat
And for the better.	En foar it better.
I can say anything and everything, whatever	Ik kin alles en alles sizze, wat dan ek
Enough about money.	Genôch oer jild.
I'm not done with words.	Ik bin net klear mei wurden.
I would not believe it either	Ik soe it ek net leauwe
I need you there.	Ik moat dy dêr ha.
I just need to talk to you	Ik moat gewoan mei dy prate
So did I.	Dat makke ik ek.
I would like to know what is in here	Ik soe graach witte wat hjir yn stiet
You can take it now if you want.	Jo kinne it no nimme as jo wolle.
He opened the door and entered.	Hy die de doar iepen en kaam der yn.
Go on, try one.	Gean troch, besykje ien.
I've never looked at it like that before.	Ik ha der noch noait sa nei sjoen.
I just came by to see how it went with her	Ik kaam gewoan troch om te sjen hoe't it mei har die
We need to be good though.	Wy moatte wol goed wêze.
I have tried to.	Ik ha besocht om.
And it became so real.	En it waard sa echt.
I went to him, not sure why.	Ik gie nei him ta, net wis wêrom.
I need someone to take her place	Ik haw ien nedich om har plak yn te nimmen
The best would yet to come.	It bêste soe noch komme.
Let me keep it.	Lit my hâlde.
It was the only thing she liked about her.	It wie it iennichste dat se fan har mocht.
Just like in life.	Krekt as yn it libben.
I need to know.	Ik moat it witte.
You have them.	Jo hawwe se.
I wondered who they were and how many were here	Ik frege my ôf wa't se wiene en hoefolle hjir wiene
I did not want this to go over me	Ik woe net dat dit oer my soe gean
But he knew it.	Mar hy koe it.
This man has come.	Dizze man is kommen.
I love having a family	Ik hâld fan in famylje hawwe
You did it for the best.	Jo hawwe it foar it bêste dien.
You have given me back my life.	Jo hawwe my myn libben werom jûn.
Her mother was so, so beautiful.	Har mem wie sa, sa moai.
And they are both round.	En se binne beide rûn.
I felt bad for him	Ik fielde min foar him
I could stay there forever	Ik koe der foar altyd bliuwe
There would never be anyone else in my house.	D'r soe noait ien oars wêze yn myn hûs.
I can not see how she could know	Ik kin net sjen hoe't se it witte koe
I'll see what we can do about it.	Ik sil sjen wat wy dêr oan dwaan kinne.
I did not hear her clearly, he said to himself	Ik hearde har net dúdlik, sei er tsjin himsels
You found his name and did not even tell me.	Jo hawwe syn namme fûn en my net iens ferteld.
I want to be with him	Ik wol by him wêze
Tell me soon.	Fertel my gau.
I think so	Ik tink it sa
No one ever had a letter for him.	Nimmen hie ea in brief foar him.
With so much happening, no one has time to get sick.	Mei safolle bart hat gjinien tiid om siik te wurden.
I do not even know where he is.	Ik wit net iens wêr't er is.
We all know that now.	Dat witte wy no allegear.
But she is not ready to give it up yet.	Mar se is noch net ree om it op te jaan.
I know you like her.	Ik wit dat jo har leuk fine.
I think my time is up	Ik tink dat myn tiid om is
I wanted more out of life	Ik woe mear út it libben
Talk to us.	Praat mei ús.
I knew it was coming.	Ik wist dat it soe kommen.
I try not to give her what she works for	Ik besykje har net te jaan wêr't se foar wurket
I love this time of year	Ik hâld fan dizze tiid fan it jier
I used to live here.	Ik wenne hjir eartiids.
This is a difficult problem.	Dit is in dreech probleem.
It hurt a lot.	It die in protte sear.
There may be a chance.	Der kin in kâns wêze.
I was there, but not for the reason you think	Ik wie der, mar net om de reden dy't jo tinke
I've never even seen it.	Ik haw it sels noait sjoen.
I will find my way.	Ik sil myn wei fine.
She liked him.	Se mocht him graach.
I wondered what could happen	Ik frege my ôf wat der barre koe
I can make something on the bed	Ik kin wat op it bêd meitsje
I know how to give these things to you	Ik wit hoe't ik dizze dingen oan dy jaan moat
I thought about it, okay	Ik tocht der oer nei, goed
I just was not that person	Ik wie gewoan net dy persoan
I just have not been with my good thoughts lately	Ik bin de lêste tiid gewoan net by myn goede gedachten west
There were only two people left.	Der wiene noch mar twa minsken oer.
I can see it clearly enough	Ik kin it dúdlik genôch sjen
That's what we did.	Dat hawwe wy dien.
I have no idea what to make of it	Ik haw gjin idee wat ik dêr fan meitsje moat
I think so.	Ik tink it goed.
I assume you have no idea then either	Ik nim oan dat jo dan ek gjin idee hawwe
You look beautiful enough.	Do lykje moai genôch.
This had never been asked of me before.	Dit wie my noch noait earder frege.
Soon they would be together.	Al gau soene se by elkoar wêze.
I know what's in front of me	Ik wit wol wat der foar my stiet
I hope my mom gets better.	Ik hoopje dat myn mem better wurdt.
I woke up from my wake	Ik waard wekker fan myn wekker
I'm not even sure of me.	Ik bin net iens wis fan my.
He could do nothing, of course.	Hy koe neat dwaan, fansels.
He would like to have a wife.	Hy wol graach in frou hawwe.
I have nothing against your work for children.	Ik ha neat tsjin dyn wurk foar bern.
I was a bit of a party girl	Ik wie in bytsje fan in feest famke
I could be wrong.	Ik koe ferkeard wêze.
He was sure he wanted her forever.	Hy wie der wis fan dat er har foar altyd woe.
I'm worried about you.	Ik meitsje my soargen oer dy.
I had never, ever seen her like that	Ik hie har nea, ea sjoen sa
Why? 	Wêrom?
Other children.	Oare bern.
I'm sure we all want that	Ik bin der wis fan dat wy dat allegear wolle
Maybe it will help.	Miskien sil it helpe.
And so he does.	En sa docht er.
The others they had never seen again.	De oare hiene se nea wer sjoen.
The bike is for money.	De fyts is foar jild.
I was not, of course.	Ik wie it net, fansels.
He did not tell anyone.	Hy hat it oan gjinien ferteld.
The door opens.	De doar iepen.
I never see you.	Ik sjoch dy noait.
I feel the same.	Ik fiel itselde.
My wife can not say enough about it.	Myn frou kin der net genôch oer sizze.
I wanted to say, but did not	Ik woe sizze, mar die net
And this is just one of the things that could happen.	En dit is mar ien fan de dingen dy't koe barre.
If only it were that easy.	As it mar sa maklik wie.
I needed help	Ik moast help krije
To go home.	Om nei hûs te gean.
I do not know what we expected to find there.	Ik wit net wat wy dêr ferwachte hiene te finen.
I can not think otherwise.	Ik kin net oars tinke.
She loves me, not you.	Se hâldt fan my, net fan dy.
Not good, exactly, but good enough.	Net goed, krekt, mar goed genôch.
I have to show him reason	Ik moat him reden sjen litte
We can not return.	Wy kinne net werom.
He is free to do so.	Hy is frij om it te dwaan.
I will get better too	Ik sil ek better wurde
I need more time.	Ik haw mear tiid nedich.
It will not work yet.	It sil noch net wurkje.
I'm thinking of saying that	Ik tink der oer om dat te sizzen
You have to see it for yourself.	Jo moatte it sels sjen.
I think they are also very nice and beautiful	Ik tink dat se ek hiel leuk en moai binne
We do not have much time.	Wy hawwe net folle tiid.
Of course they were.	Fansels wiene se.
There was a couple sitting on bed.	Der siet in pear op bêd te meitsjen.
This one.	Dizze.
I would not be here if it were not for her	Ik soe hjir net wêze as it net foar har wie
It felt good.	It fielde goed.
I want to see it.	Ik wol it sjen.
That's what he did, he said.	Dat die er wol, sei er.
I think it will happen sooner or later	Ik tink dat it earder of let bart
I'm not sure if that's a bad thing	Ik bin der net wis fan oft dat in minne ding is
Not anymore.	Net mear.
You can tell it will.	Jo kinne sizze dat it sil.
Those people did something to me.	Dy minsken diene my wat oan.
She's not what we want to see.	Se is net wat wy sjen wolle.
In my office.	Yn myn kantoar.
I know you want that	Ik wit dat jo dat wolle
I could almost see myself being her forever	Ik koe hast sjen my wêzen har foar altyd
You have to be a little bit into everything.	Jo moatte in bytsje yn alles wêze.
It never works that way.	It wurket noait sa.
In truth, it's probably both.	Yn wierheid is it wierskynlik beide.
I could see people being hit.	Ik koe sjen minsken wurde rekke.
Time is nothing.	Tiid is neat.
I was there last night.	Ik wie der fannacht.
She started this week.	Se begûn dizze wike.
I wish you could find him	Ik winskje dat jo him fine
Hope your day goes well.	Hoopje dat dyn dei goed giet.
I'm now going to make one for you	Ik gean no om ien foar jo te meitsjen
I'm happy to help.	Ik bin bliid om te helpen.
Well, today is such a day for you.	No, hjoed is sa'n dei foar dy.
I'm looking at you.	Ik sjoch nei dy.
You will never believe what happened today.	Jo sille noait leauwe wat der hjoed barde.
I hope it actually happens	Ik hoopje dat it eins bart
He would not have gotten it.	Hy soe it net krigen hawwe.
It could not stop.	It koe net ophâlde.
I got home in trouble	Ik kaam thús yn de problemen
But he saw only one.	Mar hy seach mar ien.
Something else came up to me.	Wat oars kaam my op.
I ask you.	Ik freegje dy.
That's his name.	Dat is syn namme.
Everything was busy.	Alles wie drok.
Be there together.	Wês der tegearre.
They know we're here.	Se witte dat wy hjir binne.
My friends are ready.	Myn freonen binne klear.
I need to think of something	Ik moat wat tinke
Do not do it yet.	Doch it noch net.
His was in his car.	Syn wie yn syn auto.
But not too often.	Mar net te faak.
The father looked around to see if anyone had seen him.	De heit seach om him hinne oft der ien seach.
I did not stay.	Ik bleau net sjen.
The words.	De wurden.
I want to give you a little something	Ik wol dy in bytsje wat jaan
This is how it works.	Sa wurket it.
And after my mother died.	En nei myn mem stoar.
I wanted to go there	Ik woe der hinne
And that will remain so	En dat sil sa bliuwe
I think it did not work that way	Ik tink dat it net sa wurke
I liked him, a lot	Ik mocht him, in protte
I was convinced of that	Ik wie der fan oertsjûge
I do not want to wait until we.	Ik wol net wachtsje oant wy.
I just do not need one thing anymore to worry about.	Ik haw gewoan net ien ding mear nedich om my soargen oer te meitsjen.
I got him out of the way	Ik ha him út 'e wei komme
I was just talking.	Ik wie gewoan oan it praten.
You get there.	Jo komme dêr.
Just like a year ago.	Krekt as in jier lyn.
Many just love it.	In protte hâlde der gewoan fan.
I was the only one who could see it	Ik wie de iennichste dy't it sjen koe
It's only one week.	It is mar ien wike.
Then record where you stop.	Nim dan op wêr't jo ophâlde.
I can not do this myself	Ik kin dit net sels dwaan
And something else.	En noch wat oars.
I was just like my father	Ik wie krekt as myn heit
I'm so glad you found one	Ik bin sa bliid dat jo ien fûn hawwe
But she was surprised about me, she said.	Mar se wie ferrast oer my, sei se.
I have been waiting for her all day	Ik haw de hiele dei op har wachte
That's too much.	Dat is te folle.
She did not take any water with her.	Se naam gjin wetter mei.
And never more than now.	En nea mear as no.
Just do not think about it.	Tink der mar net oan.
It must be good.	It moat goed wêze.
But not that.	Mar dat net.
This should not be so.	Dit moat net sa.
I might as well look at him	Ik mocht wol nei him sjen
I made that up.	Ik makke dat op.
I have a wife and three children.	Ik haw in frou en trije bern.
Come on everyone, it's fun to be a part of.	Kom op elkenien, it is leuk om mei te dwaan.
I don 't think so anymore.	Dat tink ik net mear.
But it was a good place.	Mar it wie in goed plak.
We would be there for three days.	Wy soene der trije dagen wêze.
I just wanted to talk to him.	Ik woe gewoan mei him prate.
I had no idea about this	Ik hie gjin idee oer dit
And sit with her.	En sit by har.
If anyone can do it, we can do it.	As immen it kin, kinne wy ​​it dwaan.
I would tell you if there was anything wrong	Ik soe it dy fertelle as der wat oan de hân wie
She would no longer try to make him happy.	Se soe net mear besykje om him bliid te meitsjen.
To me, he was just a friend.	Foar my wie hy gewoan in freon.
What it was first.	Wat it earst wie.
I also love how it feels to me	Ik hâld ek fan hoe't it my fiel
I did not like his way	Ik mocht syn manier net
And please do.	En graach dwaan.
Nice idea, well realized.	Moai idee, goed realisearre.
I participated.	Ik die mei.
No one will help me.	Nimmen sil my helpe.
But not now.	Mar no net.
In our house.	Yn ús hûs.
She did not give too much.	Se joech net te folle.
There was never enough time.	Der wie noait genôch tiid.
I'm no different now	Ik bin no net oars
I had not looked at him like that.	Ik hie net sa nei him sjoen.
They take the place of us.	Se nimme it plak fan ús oer.
I would not think it was true	Ik soe net tinke dat it wier wie
I want to help people	Ik wol minsken helpe
I did not have to do it	Ik hoegde it net te dwaan
.	.
Really and truly gone.	Echt en wier fuort.
Then we'll talk about his day.	Dan sille wy prate oer syn dei.
Even if you had been there, you would not have realized who he was.	Sels as jo der west hiene, soene jo net realisearre hawwe wa't hy wie.
I can do everything in three hours	Ik kin trije oeren alles dwaan
She had enough problems.	Se hie genôch problemen.
Well, that's not exactly true.	No, dat is net krekt wier.
It would not have been a bad life with her.	It soe gjin min libben mei har west hawwe.
You're working on this book.	Jo wurkje oan dit boek.
People just love him.	Minsken hâlde gewoan fan him.
Everything is yours.	Alles is fan jo.
I have no idea what that might be	Ik ha gjin idee wat dat wêze kin
I want to be here too	Ik wol hjir ek wêze
Other people have not.	Oare minsken hawwe net.
I do not hurt him or anything.	Ik doch him gjin sear of sa.
You can give us yourself.	Jo kinne ús sels jaan.
I'm sure there must be such a thing	Ik bin der wis fan dat d'r sa'n ding wêze moat
You do that tonight.	Jo dogge dat fannacht.
He liked him.	Hy mocht him graach.
People were talking.	Minsken wiene oan it praten.
He found nothing.	Hy fûn neat.
Well, I really need it.	No, it is my tige nedich.
If you want to come for me, fine.	As jo ​​foar my komme wolle, goed.
I know how you people work	Ik wit hoe't jo minsken wurkje
Very nice girl.	Hiel moai famke.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Fertel my asjebleaft wat der bart.
I did not expect it	Ik hie it net ferwachte
It's still here.	It is hjir noch.
Just like food.	Krekt as iten.
He said that too, but not now.	Dat sei er ek, mar no net.
We took a picture together.	Wy hawwe tegearre in foto makke.
The other never came out.	De oare kaam noait út.
I can say that happened	Ik kin sizze dat dat bard is
I was hoping the movie was better.	Ik hie hope dat de film better wie.
Well, that was not entirely true.	No, dat wie net hielendal wier.
Such a woman.	Sa'n frou.
I want to know everything about them	Ik wol alles oer har witte
You can go to school if you want.	Jo kinne nei skoalle as jo wolle.
I knew this was difficult for her	Ik wist dat dit dreech foar har wie
He could wait or he could go in there and look around him.	Hy koe wachtsje of hy koe der yn gean en om him hinne sjen.
The days are long.	De dagen binne lang.
I need to tell you something.	Ik moat dy wat fertelle.
I knew she knew the whole truth	Ik wist dat se de hiele wierheid wist
I should.	Ik soe.
He could not believe there were so many.	Hy koe net leauwe dat der safolle wiene.
It's not pretty.	It is net moai.
He was the first, but he was not the only one.	Hy wie de earste, mar hy wie net de ienige.
Nothing was good enough for her.	Neat wie goed genôch foar har.
There were only three left.	Der wiene mar trije oer.
She would find nothing.	Se soe neat fine.
Here's something else.	Hjir is noch wat.
And they say very true.	En se sizze hiel wier.
I have to go	Ik moat wol gean
If he saw her, he might be scared.	As er har seach, dan soe er miskien bang wêze.
This works better.	Dit wurket better.
I wonder what they did to you	Ik freegje my ôf wat se dy dien hawwe
I'm not good.	Ik bin net goed.
Well, here we go.	No, hjir geane wy.
I can never make anything clear.	Ik kin noait wat dúdlik meitsje.
I can never get away from it all	Ik kin noait fan alles ôf komme
I will never love anyone else	Ik sil noait fan immen oars hâlde
He could only go home.	Hy koe mar nei hûs.
I do not feel so long anymore	Ik fiel my sa lang net mear
Found a few things.	In pear dingen fûn.
I could still say he had not been here	Ik koe noch sizze dat er hjir net west hie
Please all help.	Graach alle help.
I'm scared of everything.	Ik bin fan alles bang.
I just had to think	Ik moast gewoan tinke
He had heard that there could be work.	Hy hie heard dat der wurk wêze koe.
I can not believe we are man and woman	Ik kin net leauwe dat wy man en frou binne
As much as they could.	Safolle as se koene.
I made up my mind.	Ik makke myn soargen.
He would now be free.	Hy soe no wol frij wêze.
He said maybe yes.	Hy sei miskien wol.
That's all he knows.	Dat is alles wat er wit.
I could not find anything right away	Ik koe fuort neat fine
That's how you know it is real.	Dat is hoe't jo witte dat it echt is.
But that has a time and a place.	Mar dat hat in tiid en in plak.
I said you can not say that to the police	Ik sei dat jo dat net tsjin de plysje sizze kinne
I did not think twice	Ik tocht net iens twa kear
When he really looked at me.	Doe't er echt nei my seach.
I did not like to see my mother like that	Ik mocht myn mem sa net sjen
But it did not work.	Mar it hat net wurke.
I'm sitting hard.	Ik sit hurd.
I know what happened	Ik wit wat der bard is
That does not really matter.	Dat hoecht eins net.
There's something here that you should see.	D'r is hjir wat dat jo sjen moatte.
I did not know why he even asked	Ik wist net wêrom't er sels frege
I did not know what to make of him	Ik wist net wat ik fan him meitsje moast
I quickly stopped talking	Ik bleau gau praten
I could not really say it.	Ik koe it eins net sizze.
I can not believe what happened	Ik kin it net leauwe wat der bard is
She did not believe that she was made that way.	Se liet net leauwe dat se sa makke wie.
I did not think twice	Ik tocht net twa kear
I would not hurt her.	Ik soe har net sear hawwe.
One of three things.	Ien fan trije dingen.
I even had to think of him	Ik hie sels oan him tinke moatten
I could not believe it, someone like me	Ik koe it net leauwe, ien as ik
My whole life it has been like that.	Myn hiele libben is it sa west.
The reason is life.	De reden is it libben.
She wondered who the woman was.	Se frege har ôf wa't de frou wie.
We just need some more time.	Wy hawwe gewoan wat mear tiid nedich.
This is going to be our problem from now on.	Dit is fan no ôf ús probleem te wêzen.
I do.	Dat doch ik.
I'm with a friend.	Ik bin mei in freon.
I think it's pretty much not working there	Ik tink dat it aardich der net wurket
Take this one.	Nim dizze.
There was food.	Der wie iten.
I felt nothing	Ik fielde neat
I can not help but be angry	Ik kin net oars as lilk wêze
I just wanted to look at him one last time	Ik woe noch mar in lêste kear nei him sjen
He could not do this anymore.	Hy koe dit net mear.
I want to know what happened and why they say this.	Ik wol witte wat der bard is en wêrom se dit sizze.
It's good that you did, too.	It is ek goed dat jo dat dien hawwe.
I need a normal life	Ik haw in gewoan libben nedich
It have and or.	It hawwe en of.
I did not want to be his food	Ik woe syn iten net wêze
I know you probably can 't tell me	Ik wit dat jo it my wierskynlik net kinne fertelle
Must happen early today.	Moat hjoed betiid barre.
But that time for that boy, that child, is now gone.	Mar dy tiid foar dy jonge, dat bern, binne no fuort.
I could tell they like the idea	Ik koe sizze dat se it idee leuk fine
All those things they did.	Al dy dingen dy't se dien hawwe.
But no one could be sure.	Mar gjinien koe der wis fan wêze.
I had seen him twice before.	Ik hie him twa kear earder sjoen.
Maybe we should leave.	Miskien moatte wy fuort.
He had seen him do it.	Hy hie him it dwaan sjoen.
We'll find you.	Wy sille dy fine.
I needed more time with him	Ik hie mear tiid mei him nedich
I was there, and that's not what happened	Ik wie der, en dat is net wat der bard
I can not give it anymore.	Ik kin it net mear jaan.
No problems this time.	Gjin problemen dizze kear.
He was good.	Hy wie goed.
I got the whole thing to work	Ik krige it hiele ding oan it wurk
Of course it does.	Dat docht it fansels wol.
I was one of these.	Ik wie ien fan dizze.
But she did not think it would happen here.	Mar se tocht net dat it hjir barre soe.
It should not have been.	It hie net wêze moatten.
I did not know she was home	Ik wist net dat se thús wie
Actually took it.	Eins naam it.
I do not know why she will not tell me.	Ik wit net wêrom se it my net fertelle sil.
I think someone told her.	Ik tink dat immen har fertelde.
I just want to see you	Ik wol dy gewoan sjen
I have to think.	Ik moat tinke.
I did not know it was a dog	Ik wist net dat it in hûn wie
We had problems.	Wy hiene problemen.
I came away and now it was back	Ik kaam fuort en no wie it werom
She could not be.	Se koe net wêze.
I can see no reason why he should not	Ik kin gjin reden sjen wêrom't er dat net soe
For me, it's better.	Foar my is it better.
Leave it out and move on.	Lit it út en gean troch.
You know it's nothing.	Jo witte dat it neat is.
It's not like that for everyone.	It is net foar elkenien sa.
I had no way to get word out at home	Ik hie gjin manier om wurd thús te krijen
First, they would not take me.	Earst soene se my net nimme.
But for now, he's ready.	Mar foar no is er klear.
The water arrived.	It wetter kaam oan.
I just love to see how much you love each other	Ik hâld gewoan om te sjen hoefolle jo fan elkoar hâlde
Nobody woke up.	Nimmen waard wekker.
That may not be what you want.	Dat is miskien net wat jo wolle.
They are like children.	Se binne as bern.
I can totally see why	Ik kin hielendal sjen wêrom
Just try to keep up with them.	Besykje gewoan mei har te hâlden.
He's coming tomorrow.	Hy komt moarn.
I think you will find something even more fun	Ik tink dat jo wat noch mear leuk fine
It did not go so well.	It gie net sa goed.
Want to do.	Wol dwaan.
I was not sure what else to say	Ik wie net wis wat oars te sizzen
I wanted to hurt someone	Ik woe immen sear dwaan
But he could not see that.	Mar dat koe er net sjen.
I had not yet told anyone what happened	Ik hie noch oan nimmen ferteld wat der bard is
I became very ill.	Ik waard hiel siik.
She just seemed happy.	Se like gewoan bliid.
Could have been wrong.	Koe ferkeard west hawwe.
I'm still talking to him.	Ik praat noch mei him.
Not even if it was necessary.	Ek net as it nedich wie.
There are people who have done it and people who have not.	Der binne minsken dy't it dien hawwe en minsken dy't it net hawwe.
I was glad to see him away	Ik wie bliid om him fuort te sjen
There is something for everyone.	Der is wat foar elkenien.
I would not ask for more than that	Ik soe net freegje om mear as dat
I went back to school.	Ik gie werom nei skoalle.
Lots of food.	In protte iten.
But then it will be too late.	Mar dan sil it te let wêze.
A friend to the people.	In freon foar de minsken.
Time is time.	Tiid is tiid.
I just got him here.	Ik haw him hjir krekt.
I've been a bit busy lately.	Ik haw it de lêste tiid wat drok hân.
They do not know what they are doing and it does not matter.	Se witte net wat se dogge en makket it neat út.
I walked the path we had just come	Ik rûn de wei dy't wy krekt kommen wiene
Is what happened.	Is wat der bard.
I did everything that was expected of me	Ik die alles wat fan my ferwachte waard
Come, sit here with me.	Kom, sit hjir by my.
Then the other.	Dan de oare.
I had nothing to do with him	Ik hie der neat oan om him hinne
That time is now and it's here.	Dy tiid is no en it is hjir.
You know how they are.	Jo witte hoe't se binne.
He's nice.	Hy is aardich.
I wish you had told me about this	Ik woe dat jo my oer dit ferteld hiene
I had to talk to someone about it.	Ik moast der mei immen oer prate.
I'm not sure which one.	Ik bin der net wis fan hokker.
We come for you.	Wy komme foar dy.
I can not afford not to be ready	Ik kin it my net betelje om net klear te wêzen
Not for your mother.	Net foar dyn mem.
He must.	Hy moat.
I need to know.	Ik moat it witte.
I just walked past her	Ik rûn krekt by har wei
I can talk about other things now	Ik kin no oer oare dingen prate
I just could not believe he did all those things	Ik koe gewoan net leauwe dat hy al dy dingen die
Not everyone can do it.	Net elkenien kin it dwaan.
Everyone has to make a name for themselves.	Elkenien moat in namme foar himsels meitsje.
It had gone well at first.	It wie earst goed gien.
I could not talk to anyone about it.	Ik koe der mei gjinien oer prate.
I did not have to worry	Ik hie gjin soargen hoege te hawwen
Neither could do anything.	Gjin fan beide koe neat dwaan.
That's it.	Dat die se.
None of these things happened.	Gjin fan dizze dingen barde.
I knew it was wrong to talk to him	Ik wist dat it ferkeard wie om mei him te praten
I look forward to seeing you one day.	Ik sjoch der nei út om dy ien dei te sjen.
But people do good things.	Mar minsken dogge goede dingen.
It was still day.	It wie noch dei.
I should eat something else	Ik soe wat oars ite moatte
If so, you're in the right place.	As dat sa is, binne jo op it goede plak kommen.
Reason was enough.	Reden wie genôch.
But no one saw her in another car or anything.	Mar nimmen seach har yn in oare auto of sa.
I wanted to be friends with her again.	Ik woe wer freonen mei har.
I needed to know this	Ik moast dit witte
He had done it right.	Hy hie it goed dien.
Why he did just that is not clear.	Wêrom't er dat krekt die, is net dúdlik.
I want it there	Ik wol dat it der is
All we have is today.	Alles wat wy hawwe is hjoed.
Looks pretty good.	Sjocht der aardich goed út.
I had my husband.	Ik hie myn man.
There was no more we could have done	Der wie net mear kinne wy ​​hawwe dien
He felt really bad about this.	Hy fielde him hjir echt min oer.
I could not look at her	Ik koe net nei har sjen
Would be nice to see it again.	Sil leuk wêze om it wer te sjen.
I think she should know	Ik tink dat se it witte moat
I did not wait.	Ik wachte net.
I also felt exactly the same about him	Ik fielde ek krekt itselde oer him
And no time.	En gjin tiid.
It just really does.	It docht gewoan echt.
This is how we work and, quite often, play.	Dit is hoe't wy wurkje en, frij faak, spylje.
No one knows where he went nor what he did.	Nimmen wit wêr't er gie en ek net wat er dien hat.
We get that.	Wy krije dat.
I love what he does	Ik hâld fan wat hy docht
They would have no chance.	Se soene gjin kâns hawwe.
I wanted to work with them	Ik woe mei har wurkje
I just did not know it was so	Ik wist gewoan net dat it sa wie
She could do nothing to me.	Se koe my neat dwaan.
I asked him what was going on	Ik frege him wat der bart
Where is it.	Wêr is it.
Mom took my hand.	Mem naam myn hân.
I should take her home with me	Ik soe har mei nei hûs nimme moatte
That was a problem.	Dat wie in probleem.
Sure, he would have.	Wis, hy soe hawwe.
I can say nothing more.	Ik kin neat mear sizze.
She was not sure she could do it.	Se wie der net wis fan dat se it koe.
He was planning all this.	Hy wie fan plan dit alles.
Let's give this a chance, let's see what happens.	Litte wy dit in kâns jaan, lit sjen wat der bart.
He was by himself.	Hy wie by himsels.
I do that myself a lot.	Dat doch ik sels in protte.
You will like him.	Jo sille him leuk fine.
I want to show you.	Ik wol dy sjen litte.
I will say nothing.	Ik sil neat sizze.
She stayed for that.	Dêr bleau se foar.
And sick be really sick without it.	En siik wêze echt siik sûnder it.
Or what this has to do with me.	Of wat dit mei my te krijen hat.
You get a car.	Jo krije in auto.
You may find that you like it.	Jo kinne fine dat jo it leuk fine.
They could wait.	Se koene wachtsje.
I already started there	Ik bin der al begûn
He is also a new father.	Hy is ek in nije heit.
She wished she could make it easy.	Se woe dat se it maklik meitsje koe.
It was hard.	It wie hurd.
I'll have to try this now!	Ik sil dit no besykje moatte!
You are something.	Jo binne wat.
Wouldn't that be nice ?.	Soe dat net moai wêze?.
He took no money.	Hy naam gjin jild.
I saw him yesterday	Ik seach him juster
Very good friends.	Hiel goede freonen.
Maybe you should go now though.	Miskien moatte jo no wol gean.
I did not know what to say to her	Ik wist net wat ik har fertelle moast
No one was surprised.	Nimmen wie ferrast.
We are much better than this	Wy binne folle better as dit
Also more money.	Ek mear jild.
That would have been one thing.	Dat soe ien ding west hawwe.
I was just very, very happy that she was with me	Ik wie gewoan heul, heul bliid dat se by my wie
He's not a guy who does not know what he's doing.	Hy is gjin keardel dy't net wit wat er docht.
I think it's done very well.	Ik tink dat it dêr hiel goed op dien is.
He made out.	Hy makke der út.
It was a question.	It wie in fraach.
I could go now.	Ik koe no gean.
That should make you very happy.	Dat soe jo tige bliid wêze moatte.
I feel good today	Ik fiel my hjoed goed
Knew them pretty well.	Koene se aardich goed.
It scares me.	It makket my bang.
They are not for that.	Dêr binne se net foar.
But no life.	Mar gjin libben.
I had tried.	Ik hie besocht.
She loves me.	Se hâldt fan my.
Many people agree with me.	In protte minsken binne it mei my iens.
It has to come.	It moat komme.
And better for it.	En better foar it.
Maybe one in a year.	Miskien ien yn in jier.
I was not sure what he would do	Ik wie der net wis fan wat er dwaan soe
He's done it before.	Hy hat it earder dien.
Or is there ?.	Of is der?.
I have not had that for so long	Dat haw ik sa lang net hân
But we did it for a really good reason.	Mar wy diene it foar in echt goede reden.
But those people come and go.	Mar dy minsken komme en gean gewoan.
But he kept going.	Mar hy gie troch.
None other than.	Nimmen oars as.
A whole family.	In hiele famylje.
When the police arrive, it's the same for them all.	As de plysje komt, is it foar har allegear itselde.
I know it's not good.	Ik wit dat it net goed is.
If you're not into it, do not enter.	As jo ​​der net yn binne, kom dan net yn.
I have no problems	Ik haw gjin problemen
She lives with her mother.	Se wennet by har mem.
That's good.	Dat is goed.
I was not asked to leave.	Ik waard net frege om fuort te gean.
Today there are only a few left.	Hjoed binne der mar in pear oer.
She says it's hard, but it will happen.	Se seit dat it dreech is, mar it sil barre.
They are the best things in my life.	Se binne de bêste dingen yn myn libben.
I hope you will	Ik hoopje dat jo it sille
That's what I would think.	Dat soe ik tinke.
I knew it had to be his father	Ik wist dat it syn heit wêze moast
I knew it would, one day	Ik wist dat it soe, ien dei
I would take care of them.	Ik soe foar har soargje.
That child is mine, not hers.	Dat bern is fan my, net fan har.
She had never liked them.	Se hie se noait leuk fûn.
I think there's a chance they're doing something right	Ik tink dat der in kâns is dat se wat goed dogge
In a house.	Yn in hûs.
It had been said that they would be there for a long time.	It hie sein dat se der noch lang wêze soene.
I did not do any of these.	Ik die net ien fan dizze.
I can not ask you to take it	Ik kin jo net freegje it te nimmen
I think you should not	Ik tink dat jo net moatte
I think the dog was like family	Ik tink dat de hûn wie as famylje
I think you will see why	Ik tink dat jo sille sjen wêrom
Maybe someone should look into this.	Miskien moat immen hjir nei sjen.
He set another time for us to come back.	Hy sette in oare tiid foar ús om werom te kommen.
It must.	It moat.
I wanted to help everyone	Ik woe elkenien helpe
I would not do this with anyone	Ik soe dit net mei ien dwaan
I wish him well.	Ik winskje him goed.
This is true for many things in my life.	Dit is wier foar in protte dingen yn myn libben.
It was nice though	It wie wol aardich
Make sure you have a lot and a lot of time.	Wês wis dat jo in protte en in protte tiid hawwe.
I can not make you happy.	Ik kin dy net bliid meitsje.
I assume she does not have to	Ik nim oan dat se net hoecht
But this is home.	Mar dit is thús.
They are just different.	Se binne gewoan oars.
I think there could always be a better one	Ik tink dat der altyd in bettere wêze koe
I had to go back to her	Ik moast werom nei har
I just wanted to talk to her	Ik woe gewoan mei har prate
I found her back here, looked around me.	Ik fûn har hjir werom, seach om my hinne.
I had to leave soon	Ik moast gau fuort
I had one back home	Ik hie ien werom by hûs
I would say nothing more about him	Ik soe neat mear oer him sizze
I had to have it now	Ik moast it no hawwe
Your time is not now.	Jo tiid is net no.
I think we'll have it the same way	Ik tink dat wy it op deselde manier sille hawwe
He was surprised to see me.	Hy wie ferrast om my te sjen.
If you want them, get them.	As jo ​​​​se wolle, krije se.
I wondered where we were going	Ik frege my ôf wêr't wy hinne wiene
Nothing else really matters.	Neat oars makket echt út.
Come back again.	Kom wer werom.
If he can even better or something.	As kin er sels noch better of sa.
She was all wrong.	Se wie allegear ferkeard.
I think you can do it	Ik tink dat jo it kinne
He sat like that for what seemed like forever.	Hy siet sa foar wat like foar altyd.
But, it did.	Mar, it die.
Dad and I.	Heit en ik.
He will need more.	Hy sil mear nedich hawwe.
That's out for me.	Dat is foar my út.
I was the same way as a boy	Ik wie deselde manier as in jonge
You know what they are.	Jo witte wat se binne.
I told only one friend.	Ik fertelde mar ien freon.
I just was not sure how you would take it	Ik wie gewoan net wis hoe't jo it nimme soene
Those are problems.	Dat binne problemen.
I can not stay that way	Ik kin net by dy wei bliuwe
I want you forever.	Ik wol dy foar altyd.
But there were other things as well.	Mar der wiene ek oare dingen.
I think no one has seen her husband either	Ik tink dat nimmen har man ek sjoen hat
But we have nothing.	Mar wy hawwe neat.
I wish you would never do anything else	Ik winskje jo noait wat oars te dwaan
I knew he loved me a little.	Ik wist dat hy wat fan my hâlde.
Let something come.	Lit wat komt komme.
He was in trouble, big trouble.	Hy wie yn de problemen, grutte problemen.
I'm sure you have yours.	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo hawwe dyn.
They have no children together.	Se hawwe gjin bern tegearre.
When, we'll see.	Wannear, sille wy sjen.
I wonder if he comes back or if this happens often.	Ik freegje my ôf oft er werom komt of dat dit faak bart.
The guy is out of the house.	De keardel is it hûs út.
I was in the right place	Ik wie op it goede plak
I know exactly what she's talking about.	Ik wit krekt wêr't se it oer hat.
Life after life.	It libben nei it libben.
I wish you and your wife the best.	Ik winskje dy en dyn frou it bêste ta.
But it does the job well.	Mar it docht it wurk goed.
Opened the door again.	Die de doar wer iepen.
I ran away from everything	Ik rûn fan alles ôf
I ask to go back to my house	Ik freegje om werom te gean nei myn hûs
I talk to him often	Ik praat mei him faak
People are so nice.	Minsken binne sa aardich.
I have tried it a few times	Ik haw it in pear kear besocht
Even like her father, she would have no idea.	Sels as har heit soe se gjin idee hawwe.
I should not have spoken to you like that	Ik hie net sa tsjin dy prate moatten
I did, really.	Ik die, echt.
I want to go home.	Ik wol wol nei hûs.
Two more to go.	Noch twa te gean.
I did not want you to be yourself	Ik woe net dat jo sels wiene
I would be sad	Ik soe dreech wêze
I did not want that to be true.	Dat woe ik net wier hawwe.
Maybe we are not quite there yet.	Miskien binne wy ​​der noch net hielendal.
I would not have bought them	Ik soe se net hawwe kocht
I looked at her again	Ik seach har wer oan
I do not have to agree with this here	Ik moat it hjir net mei iens wêze
He badly needed her.	Hy hie har min nedich.
No one knew how long our wait could be.	Nimmen wist hoe lang ús wachtsje koe wêze.
I had no friends there, no other family	Ik hie dêr gjin freonen, gjin oare famylje
Well, you know what will happen then.	No, jo witte wat der dan barre sil.
I wonder if they are both good	Ik freegje oft se beide goed binne
That could not go wrong anymore.	Dat koe net mear ferkeard.
I've not been home in days	Ik bin al dagen net thús west
Nothing has come of it yet.	Der is noch neat fan kommen.
Not that it was not fun.	Net dat it net leuk wie.
I just love watching this.	Ik hâld gewoan fan dit te sjen.
I do not want them to be afraid of this place.	Ik wol net dat se bang binne foar dit plak.
I love this.	Ik hâld fan dizze.
I hope it does the same for you!	Ik hoopje dat it itselde foar jo docht!
That you can get.	Dat kinne jo krije.
I feel exactly the same.	Ik fiel krekt itselde.
And work did it.	En wurk die it.
She wanted to know what she could do about it.	Se woe witte wat se der oan dwaan koe.
He needs to do something good.	Hy moat wat goed dwaan.
I will never work again	Ik sil noait wer wurkje
I wanted to help her, but she did not let me.	Ik woe har helpe, mar se lit my net.
This was one of those days.	Dit wie ien fan dy dagen.
This was her place, her place.	Dit wie har plak, har plak.
To find food we find people.	Om iten te finen fine wy ​​minsken.
He did not have much to say.	Hy hie net folle te sizzen.
It seemed like hours until the food arrived.	It like oeren oant it iten kaam.
Lots to take in.	In protte om yn te nimmen.
I want to show you something else	Ik wol dy noch wat sjen litte
Make it what you want it to be.	Meitsje der fan wat jo wolle.
I could hardly believe it.	Ik koe it hast net leauwe.
But not my father.	Mar net myn heit.
The job is gone.	De baan is fuort.
Maybe he didn 't do it fast enough.	Miskien hat er it net gau genôch dien.
I was expecting you a little earlier	Ik hie dy wat earder ferwachte
You can have that one.	Jo kinne dat ien hawwe.
I need to be open here.	Ik moat hjir iepen wêze.
They were still nice though.	Se wiene noch wol aardich.
I want you ready	Ik wol dat jo klear meitsje
We're better than that.	Wy binne better as dat.
It was really, really fun.	It wie echt, echt leuk.
They did a really nice job	Se diene in echt moai wurk
I could not say what it was	Ik koe net sizze wat it wie
I knew right away who it was	Ik wist fuort wa't it wie
I felt really bad.	Ik fielde my echt min.
I hope we can help each other.	Ik hoopje dat wy elkoar helpe kinne.
This is who you are.	Dit is wa't jo binne.
That, of course, is the police.	Dat is fansels de plysje.
Here we go.	Hjir geane wy.
This was too late.	Dit wie te let.
We talk for two hours.	Wy prate twa oeren.
I have to do this right away please	Ik moat dit dien fuort asjebleaft
We hope to see you there !!.	Wy hoopje dy dêr te sjen!!.
She waited a few days.	Se wachte in pear dagen.
I can give her anything she wants	Ik kin har alles jaan wat se wol
I need to know that you really believe me	Ik moat witte dat jo my echt leauwe
He loves my job.	Hy hat myn wurk.
But not now, not now.	Mar net no, net no.
Do not ask me how.	Freegje my net hoe.
I can see nothing about him	Ik kin neat oer him sjen
We need you.	Wy hawwe dy nedich.
Keep me posted with everything.	Hâld my oan mei alles.
I was not the only one	Ik wie net de ienige
You can not ask anyone.	Jo kinne gjinien freegje.
I probably will not do it again	Ik sil it wierskynlik net wer dwaan
We'll look at how to do this next.	Wy sille sjen nei hoe't te dwaan dit folgjende.
I have to go back to that	Ik moat der op werom
You only get one chance	Jo krije mar ien kâns
We know enough.	Wy witte genôch.
I knew it was a bad idea to come here alone	Ik wist dat it in min idee wie om hjir allinnich te kommen
Things will never be the same again.	Dingen sille nea wer itselde wêze.
I have no one to be afraid of	Ik haw gjinien om bang foar te wêzen
Maybe it would never be ready.	Miskien soe it nea klear wêze.
I knew he did not really see me	Ik wist dat hy my eins net seach
Of course that is what happened.	Fansels is dat wat bard.
I have to take care of these people	Ik moat foar dizze minsken soargje
They want to know more.	Se wolle mear witte.
I asked if we could talk to you	Ik frege oft wy mei dy prate koene
I can not stay here without you	Ik kin hjir net sûnder dy bliuwe
I came away with almost nothing	Ik kaam fuort mei hast neat
I was this all the time	Ik wie dit de hiele tiid
In his last hours he thought of you.	Yn syn lêste oeren tocht er oan dy.
One day you will know it.	Op in dei sille jo it witte.
A little something for you	In bytsje wat foar dy
There is no way that will happen.	D'r is gjin manier dat dat sil barre.
He seemed to be talking to himself.	Hy like tsjin himsels te praten.
I had to tell him.	Ik moast it him fertelle.
I could not tell what she thought	Ik koe net fertelle wat se tocht
That seems to be the word of the week.	Dat liket it wurd fan de wike te wêzen.
Must and will be very different.	Moat en sil hiel oars.
It will be good for you.	It sil foar jo goed wêze.
I'm very, very good at it	Ik bin der hiel, hiel goed yn
I thought so.	Dat tocht ik.
The child has to play every day.	It bern moat alle dagen spylje.
Do not want it to be.	Wolle jo it net wêze.
But he asked himself.	Mar hy frege him ôf.
Or even two.	Of sels twa.
I could not get them out of the house.	Ik koe se net út 'e hûs krije.
You never take anything out.	Jo nimme noait wat út.
It is not without reason.	It is net sûnder reden.
I found faith.	Ik fûn leauwe.
I'm sorry to see her away	It spyt my har fuort te sjen
He just told me.	Hy hat my krekt ferteld.
He's nice too.	Hy is ek aardich.
I was paying attention.	Ik wie let op.
But your father has been bad.	Mar dyn heit hat min west.
I will not be bought again	Ik sil net mear kocht wurde
That was our house.	Dat wie ús hûs.
But I can not do that.	Mar ik kin dat net dwaan.
And he has.	En hy hat.
And you can really tell.	En jo kinne echt fertelle.
Even though she was a girl.	Ek al wie se in famke.
I actually think they make a good pair	Ik eins tink dat se meitsje in goed pear
This, it is obtained from our office.	Dit, it wurdt krigen fan ús kantoar.
I want him to look at me.	Ik wol dat er nei my sjocht.
No one even knows his name.	Nimmen wit sels syn namme.
It's my favorite.	It is myn favorite.
Well, this way they will not.	No, dizze manier sille se net.
I felt so bad for him	Ik fielde my sa min foar him
I really need to get to bed at home	Ik moat echt thús op bêd
I wanted her in my bed	Ik woe har yn myn bêd
I needed the money.	Ik hie it jild nedich.
One more thing.	Noch ien ding.
I see no problem with that.	Dêr sjoch ik gjin probleem mei.
It did not work.	It wurke net.
That's what you should ask of him.	Dat moatte jo fan him freegje.
There was no one who told us what to do	D'r wie gjinien dy't ús fertelde wat te dwaan
I wonder where they are coming from and where they are going.	Ik freegje my ôf wêr't se wei komme en wêr't se hinne gean.
Do not mind.	Tink it net iens.
Now you're in trouble.	No bist yn de problemen.
I'm really not sure why.	Ik bin echt net wis wêrom.
It did not come.	It kaam net.
But she did not make it.	Mar se hat it net makke.
He has been so open with her.	Hy hat sa iepen mei har west.
I could believe that	Dat koe ik leauwe
But let's get this right now.	Mar lit ús dit no krekt krije.
I give him nothing	Ik jou him neat
I realized what had just happened.	Ik realisearre wat der krekt bard wie.
I have never tried, not even once	Ik ha noait besocht, net iens ien kear
I saw nothing	Ik seach neat
Come on, let's be friends again.	Kom, litte wy wer freonen wurde.
It may not be much fun.	It kin net folle leuk wêze.
All those things are good.	Al dy dingen binne goed.
What did he do with it.	Wat die er mei.
I believe they are ready to go	Ik leau dat se klear binne om fuort te gean
But there was no way out.	Mar der wie net út te kommen.
It's hard.	It is dreech.
I had never talked to her before	Ik hie nea earder mei har praat
I will not regret it	Ik sil der gjin spyt fan hawwe
If you have one, take it off.	As jo ​​ien hawwe, nim dan ôf.
It was in everything he did.	It wie yn alles wat hy die.
One way or another.	Op de ien of oare manier.
They will be happy to be here.	Se sille bliid wêze om hjir te wêzen.
To her, then from her, then back to her.	Nei har ta, dan fan har ôf, dan werom nei har ta.
It all seemed pretty clear to him.	It like him allegear frij dúdlik.
I was not one of these	Ik wie net ien fan dizze
And it is not that there is one to help.	En it is net sa dat der ien is om te helpen.
There needs to be more to it than that.	Der moat mear by wêze as dat.
I'm sure they should not be, but they should not be.	Ik bin der wis fan dat se net wêze soene, mar se moatte net wêze.
I saw a lot of people in that place	Ik seach in protte minsken op dat plak
And it happened.	En it barde.
I remember his father	Ik tink oan syn heit
She started again twice.	Se begûn wer twa kear.
But if you have more time, you can do them.	Mar as jo mear tiid hawwe, kinne jo se dwaan.
We will do this and that for you.	Wy sille dit en dat foar jo dwaan.
Everyone there knows it too.	Elkenien dêr wit it ek.
This was our last chance.	Dit wie ús lêste kâns.
I was also a good friend of your father	Ik wie ek in goede freon fan dyn heit
He always knew how to say the right thing.	Hy wist altyd it goede te sizzen.
I would never be good enough for him	Ik soe noait goed genôch foar him wêze
I wonder who they are talking about	Ik freegje my ôf oer wa't se it hawwe
I want to do what's good	Ik wol dwaan wat goed is
I went to school for both of us	Ik gie foar ús beide nei skoalle
I was sure he had heard all about it by now	Ik wie der wis fan dat er der no alles oer heard hie
Maybe you have them.	Miskien hawwe jo se.
I knew my life could not go well for too long	Ik wist dat myn libben te lang net goed gean koe
Whatever it is.	Wat it sil.
I was pretty happy with it	Ik wie der aardich bliid mei
I could not believe it had worked	Ik koe net leauwe dat it wurke hie
I could not find any problems	Ik koe net fine gjin problemen
That's what we're talking about now.	Dêr hawwe wy it no oer.
I should have just let things go	Ik hie de dingen mar litte moatten
It was what he did best.	It wie wat hy it bêste die.
I did that once.	Dat haw ik ien kear dien.
I wonder what it is with them	Ik freegje my ôf wat it mei har is
And that's a problem.	En dat is in probleem.
A young boy.	In jonge jonge.
Or they did something bad in an earlier life.	Of se diene wat min yn in earder libben.
You should have seen it.	Do hiest it sjen moatten.
You just never seem to do that much these days.	Jo gewoan nea lykje te dwaan wat folle dizze dagen.
Maybe it was just him.	Miskien wie it gewoan hy.
I'm glad she's gone.	Ik bin bliid dat se fuort is.
Nothing has been done yet.	Der is noch neat dien.
Here it is.	Hjir is it.
I looked to see if she saw them too	Ik seach nei om te sjen oft se se ek seach
He knows my name.	Hy wit myn namme.
This book is something else.	Dit boek is wat oars.
I thought.	Ik haw tocht.
There was not much else she could do.	Der wie net folle oars dat se dwaan koe.
We had some really good people out there	Wy hiene in pear echt goede minsken út dêr
I agree with you there, man	Ik bin it dêr mei dy iens, man
I looked away from her	Ik seach fan har ôf
That's what they did.	Dat hiene se dien.
I never know.	Ik wit it noait.
I want to see my mother, bad	Ik wol myn mem sjen, min
I need to get one.	Ik moat ien krije.
We'm sure of it.	Wy binne der wis fan.
I think that seems good	Ik tink dat liket goed
He does not think so.	Dat tinkt er net.
But there you go.	Mar dêr meitsje jo dy op ta.
I know you were not.	Ik wit dat jo net wiene.
I actually like the guy.	Ik eins like de keardel.
He thinks he's my friend.	Hy tinkt dat hy myn freon is.
She was now often asked without him.	Se waard no faak frege sûnder him.
And there it is.	En dêr is.
And these are as follows.	En dizze binne as folgjende.
I love you and want only what is best for you	Ik hâld fan dy en wol allinnich wat it bêste foar dy is
I felt you needed my help	Ik fielde dat jo myn help nedich hawwe
But do not worry.	Mar meitsje jo gjin soargen.
I could not believe how old she looked	Ik koe net leauwe hoe âld se like
I had to tell her about me	Ik moast har oer my fertelle
I realized that yesterday	Dat realisearre ik my juster
Maybe we'll get it right there.	Miskien krije wy it dêr goed.
I love reading.	Ik hâld fan lêzen.
She's on my bed.	Se is op myn bêd.
I must first have a word with her	Ik moat earst mar in wurd mei har hawwe
He could not have come at a better time.	Hy koe net op in bettere tiid komme.
The work was good or bad.	It wurk wie goed of ferkeard.
Afraid, they should be, but she had to do something.	Bang, se moatte wêze, mar se moast wat dwaan.
You worry about that.	Dêr meitsje jo jo soargen oer.
I am happy.	Ik bin bliid.
We want to know.	Wy wolle witte.
He did not come here so often.	Hy kaam hjir net sa faak.
I knew he was it for me	Ik wist dat hy it foar my wie
It was exactly what she wanted.	It wie krekt wat se woe.
Wait for one.	Wachtsje op ien.
Make more money.	Meitsje mear jild.
Try to find some good reason for it.	Besykje te finen wat goede reden foar it.
I've never seen the guy before	Ik haw de keardel noch noait earder sjoen
Not to her mother.	Net oan har mem.
It was not a very good photo.	It wie net in hiel goede foto.
I was pretty happy with how it went	Ik wie aardich bliid mei hoe't it gie
One is white.	Ien is wit.
I love all these things	Ik hâld fan al dizze dingen
Well, it's time kids.	No, it is tiid bern.
I felt it in my whole being	Ik fielde it yn myn hiele wêzen
He was still with me.	Hy wie noch by my.
It's just not for me.	It is gewoan net foar my.
I told you that when you met her	Ik fertelde dy dat doe't jo moete har
This is probably what happened to you.	Dit is nei alle gedachten wat der bard mei dy.
She wanted to ask.	Se woe freegje.
Time for you to do what you do best.	Tiid foar jo om te dwaan wat jo it bêste dogge.
I have nothing but time	Ik haw neat as tiid
I never expected you to do something	Ik hie noait ferwachte dat jo wat dwaan soene
They are for everyone.	Se binne foar elkenien.
He must find the child to be whole again.	Hy moat it bern fine om wer hiel te wêzen.
I'll get you another one.	Ik sil dy noch ien krije.
I can be here for you.	Ik kin hjir foar dy wêze.
That seems to me a good reason to have a party.	Dat liket my in goede reden om in feest te hawwen.
I could not leave it.	Ik koe it net litte.
How come they had not thought of it before? 	Hoe kaam it dat se der net earder oan tocht hiene?
she asked.	frege se har ôf.
I would better go and see	Ik soe better gean en sjen
What's more, you know it's the truth.	Wat mear is, jo witte dat it de wierheid is.
Not like there used to be.	Net sa as der wie.
This was again a day at work for us.	Dit wie wer in dei oan it wurk foar ús.
I could not have children.	Ik koe gjin bern krije.
I could not wait for him	Ik koe net op him wachtsje
Words are not enough.	Wurden binne net genôch.
Would love to return one day.	Soe graach werom ien dei.
But here is nothing else.	Mar hjir is neat oars.
You're just scared.	Do bist gewoan bang.
I was just reading what it said	Ik wie krekt te lêzen wat it sei
You have to stick to it.	Jo moatte der by hâlde.
I do not know anymore.	Ik wit it net mear.
He can no longer say right from wrong.	Hy kin net mear goed fan ferkeard sizze.
I'm not sure why it does not work.	Ik bin der net wis fan wêrom it net wurket.
I will do what you want	Ik sil dwaan wat jo wolle
I would have heard otherwise	Ik hie oars heard
I'm getting pretty good at it.	Ik wurd der aardich goed yn.
I looked up at him	Ik seach wat nei him op
Not too much.	Net te folle.
She looked up at you.	Se seach op nei dy.
I just want to ask.	Ik wol gewoan freegje.
I hope you find something here that you like	Ik hoopje dat jo hjir wat fine dat jo leuk fine
I suppose that would make him a little difficult	Ik nim oan dat dat him wol wat dreech makket
And get on with my life.	En gean troch mei myn libben.
He thought it was so good.	Hy tocht dat it sa goed wie.
I walked away	Ik rûn fuort
She likes to do that every now and then.	Dat docht se graach sa no en dan.
I used to think it was fun	Ik tocht eartiids dat it leuk wie
I came home from work today.	Ik kaam hjoed thús fan it wurk.
I want you to stay there	Ik wol dat jo dêr bliuwe
I hope it comes back	Ik hoopje dat it werom komt
In fact, we would already be there.	Eins soene wy ​​der al wêze.
I thought about it a lot	Ik tocht der in protte oer
I know your work very well.	Ik ken dyn wurk hiel goed.
Just not going to give it up.	Giet se net te jaan.
For me, it was just an idea.	Foar my wie it mar in idee.
That's the only thing for them to do.	Dat is it iennichste foar har te dwaan.
I still think he thinks it was gone	Ik tink noch dat er tinkt dat it fuort wie
A friend who looked more like a friend	In freon, dy't mear like as in freon
We do it for kids.	Wy dogge it foar bern.
And of course there was a movie.	En fansels wie der in film.
I can not say for sure.	Ik kin it net wis sizze.
There was no chance for one.	Der wie gjin kâns foar ien.
And if not, why not ?.	En sa net, wêrom net?.
I only come to you once a week	Ik kom nei dy mar ien kear yn 'e wike
He must visit us every day.	Hy moat ús alle dagen besykje.
I know the day, the hour	Ik ken de dei, it oere
I do not agree with him	Ik bin it net mei him iens
We have not received it back yet.	Wy hawwe it noch net werom krigen.
You can go through that.	Dêr kinne jo troch.
He knew he could do it.	Hy wist dat er it dwaan koe.
I wondered if he knew me so well	Ik frege my ôf oft er my sa goed koe
It just does not seem right to me.	It liket my gewoan net goed.
I can not help it anymore	Ik kin it net mear helpe
He was back.	Hy wie werom.
As a person.	As persoan.
But he does not show it.	Mar hy lit it net sjen.
If there is anything you want to know, please come to me.	As der wat is dat jo witte wolle, kom dan nei my.
I was scared of her	Ik wie bang foar har
After all, we will be fine.	Nei alle gedachten sille wy goed wêze.
She was in his bed.	Se wie yn syn bêd.
There they are and we.	Dêr binne se en wy.
He would do anything for the people he loves.	Hy soe alles dwaan foar de minsken dy't hy hâldt.
But I do not know how to do it.	Mar ik wit net hoe't ik it dwaan moat.
This does not work.	Dit docht net.
I did and he did not like it	Ik die en hy mocht it net
I know you did the best you could	Ik wit dat jo it bêste dien hawwe dat jo koene
I'm no longer on things.	Ik bin net mear op 'e dingen.
I was hoping to get something tonight	Ik hie hope fannacht wat te krijen
It was only from him.	It wie allinnich fan him.
I came back here last year.	Ik kaam hjir ferline jier werom.
Maybe she was just tired.	Miskien wie se gewoan wurch.
I really did not know what to do.	Ik wist echt net wat ik dwaan moast.
I told you that when we met.	Ik fertelde dy dat doe't wy moete.
But you can have something.	Mar jo kinne wat hawwe.
I had to look away from that	Dêr moast ik fan ôf sjen
I can 't do that right now	Dat kin ik no krekt net
I want to know about this happening.	Ik wol witte oer dit bart.
And they may even be something else now.	En se kinne no sels wat oars wêze.
I needed to know what's going on.	Ik moast witte wat der bart.
We have the whole day for that tomorrow.	Dêr hawwe wy moarn de hiele dei foar.
I kept reading.	Ik bleau lêzen.
Be careful.	Wês mar foarsichtich.
You expected it.	Jo hawwe it ferwachte.
But that's not her.	Mar dat is se net.
I'm not happy every day	Ik bin net alle dagen bliid
No need to look at us twice.	Gjin reden om twa kear nei ús te sjen.
More than you think.	Mear as jo tinke.
I wonder if she would be here	Ik freegje my ôf soe se hjir wêze
Maybe that’s where the problem started.	Miskien is dêr it probleem begûn.
He said he did it.	Hy sei dat hy it die.
I think he was not happy	Ik tink dat hy net bliid wie
I saw something in you	Ik seach wat yn dy
I just wish it had been more	Ik winskje gewoan dat it mear west hie
It's only a month ago.	It is noch mar in moanne lyn.
But it's different for you.	Mar it is oars foar dy.
Always love me so much.	Hâld altyd sa fan my.
I know he's having a hard time	Ik wit dat hy it dreech hat
It's why she is.	It is wêrom se is.
In and out again.	Yn en wer út.
So tired of it all.	Sa wurch fan it allegear.
I pretend I do not see it	Ik doch oft ik it net sjoch
You know it's too late.	Jo witte dat it te let is.
Just like her mother.	Krekt as har mem.
I almost did it again	Ik die it hast wer
I can see nothing	Ik kin neat sjen
She had told him to go, that he was gone.	Se hie him sein om te gean, dat hy wie fuort.
I felt it but did not care	Ik fielde it mar hie it der net om
Well, that's it.	No, dat is it.
I know how much you want to find her	Ik wit hoefolle jo har fine wolle
But, you have no money.	Mar, jo hawwe gjin jild.
I did not know why.	Ik wist net wêrom.
I have back problems	Ik haw werom problemen oan
I can not have it my way	Ik kin it net op myn manier hawwe
That's what we do.	Dat dogge wy.
Sit here and wait.	Sit hjir en wachtsje.
It's good that it's there.	It is goed dat it der is.
I could no longer see it in her	Ik koe it net mear oan har sjen
It was very difficult, but we knew to be here.	It wie hiel dreech, mar wy wisten hjir te wêzen.
I was totally wrong about you	Ik wie hielendal ferkeard oer dy
I did not see how they could do otherwise	Ik seach net hoe't se oars kinne
I think they are ready now	Ik tink dat se no klear binne
I did not want to love anyone.	Ik woe net fan ien hâlde.
I did that too	Dat die ik ek al
So it is.	Sa is it.
I had to get that guy back to work	Ik moast dy keardel wer oan it wurk krije
I told her to go away, though	Ik fertelde har om fuort te gean, mar
You did that yourself.	Dat diene jo sels.
I really like this guy	Ik hâld echt fan dizze keardel
I should not be here yet	Ik soe hjir noch net wêze moatte
I see where she looks and see them	Ik sjoch wêr't se sjocht en sjoch se
Everything works fine.	Alles wurket goed.
They like to do that.	Dat dogge se graach.
That he had hoped for.	Dat hie er hope.
It can find you as a woman, or as a mother.	It kin jo fine as frou, of as mem.
I'm totally fine	Ik bin hielendal goed
I have to get used to the idea first	Ik moat earst wenne oan it idee
And there we can not stop.	En dêr kinne wy ​​net ophâlde.
I just feel so bad.	Ik fiel my gewoan sa min.
I should have seen him	Ik hie him sjen moatten
He could not give up so easily.	Hy koe him sa maklik net jaan.
I was not ready for that yet	Dêr wie ik noch net klear foar
We'll find a way to make things right, you and me.	Wy sille in manier fine om dingen goed te meitsjen, do en ik.
I do not let her do it.	Ik lit har it net dwaan.
I'll talk like a woman.	Ik sil prate as in frou.
I think you better come with me	Ik tink dat jo better mei my komme
I want to do something	Ik wol wat dwaan
It said they were not ready.	It sei se wiene net klear.
As you probably will.	As jo ​​wierskynlik sille.
A room where he also went	In keamer wêr't er ek gie
Maybe we should not believe him.	Miskien moatte wy him net leauwe.
I think whoever it is scares him	Ik tink dat wa't it is, him bang hat
But it does not work.	Mar it wurket net.
Nobody knows this.	Nimmen wit dit.
Without a word.	Sûnder in wurd.
Everyone who is not against us is for us.	Elkenien dy't net tsjin ús is, is foar ús.
She walked away without a word.	Se rûn fuort sûnder in wurd.
I never expected it to do that.	Ik hie noait ferwachte dat it dat soe dwaan.
My! 	Myn!
I'm no different than you	Ik bin net oars as dy
I'm not through with you.	Ik bin net troch mei dy.
They will be able to help you.	Se sille jo kinne helpe.
I have not been there with me.	Ik bin der net by my west.
I was surprised at how good it felt	Ik wie ferrast oer hoe goed it fielde
Maybe the movie was too old.	Miskien wie de film te âld.
I think you should buy us something	Ik tink dat jo ús wat keapje moatte
They did not do the right thing.	Se diene net it goede ding.
I saw no one, heard nothing	Ik seach nimmen, hearde neat
A way she had never seen before	In manier dy't se noch noait earder sjoen hie
I wondered why she did it	Ik frege my ôf wêrom't se it die
I can take them back	Ik kin se werom nimme
I have to agree, it is	Ik moat it iens wêze, it is
I see this is not.	Ik sjoch dat dizze net is.
I'm trying it on.	Ik besykje it op.
She wondered how they were going to do it.	Se frege har ôf hoe't se it dwaan soene.
Let them come.	Lit se komme.
It's easy to read.	It is maklik te lêzen.
Let the girl be happy.	Lit it famke bliid wêze.
She said she would come.	Se sei dat se komme soe.
I can not come with you	Ik kin net mei dy komme
She needed to know.	Se moast it witte.
This would not come in handy.	Dit soe net goed komme.
She had many friends.	Se hie in protte freonen.
I felt sick again.	Ik fielde my wer siik.
He's getting over it.	Hy komt der wol oer.
You would be surprised.	Jo soene ferrast wurde.
If you really want to.	As jo ​​echt wolle.
Whether one of them was true or not.	Oft ien fan it wier wie of net.
I knew where he lived, now	Ik wist wêr't hy wenne, no
You know and this is the first time.	Jo witte en dit is de earste kear.
I did not see anyone	Ik seach net ien
I had never seen him before	Ik hie him der noch nea op sjoen
This has nothing to do with you.	Dit hat neat mei dy te krijen.
I also want you to go to class	Ik wol ek dat jo nei de klasse geane
It's not good enough.	It is net goed genôch.
I know many of you have heard about this book.	Ik wit dat in protte fan jo oer dit boek heard hawwe.
He's home tomorrow.	Hy is moarn thús.
I'm bad.	ik bin min.
I had not really looked at him	Ik hie net echt nei him sjoen
I just want to be in bed	Ik wol gewoan op bêd
I could say nothing	Ik koe neat sizze
I did not say those things	Ik sei dy dingen net
The dog did not come.	De hûn kaam net.
Nobody knew he was here.	Nimmen wist dat er hjir wie.
Well, well, that's not true.	No, goed, dat is net wier.
And that's what we get here.	En dat is wat wy hjir krije.
It was time for me to leave.	It wie tiid foar my om fuort te gean.
He did not completely agree.	Hy wie it net hielendal iens.
I can not believe they will never see their children	Ik kin net leauwe dat se har bern noait sille sjen
And, in a way, it was.	En, op in manier, wie it.
I actually think of him a bit	Ik tink him eins in bytsje
She said more.	Se hat mear sein.
I had to ask for his help	Ik moast om syn help freegje
This may or may not have been true.	Dit kin of miskien net wier west hawwe.
I read the whole thing	Ik haw it hiele ding lêzen
They did not know it would, but it was the best they had.	Se wisten net dat it soe, mar it wie it bêste dat se hiene.
I did not know you would be here	Ik wist net dat jo hjir wêze soene
That's right, your hand there.	Dat is krekt, dyn hân dêr.
I do not even know what is best for me.	Ik wit net iens wat it bêste foar my is.
But this was not the place.	Mar dit wie net it plak.
Three times in two years, to the same woman.	Trije kear yn twa jier, nei deselde frou.
It did not happen easily.	It barde net maklik.
Not for very long.	Net foar hiel lang.
Show who you are.	Lit sjen wa't jo binne.
You are mine.	Do bist myn.
We do not want her to come too soon.	Wy wolle net dat se te gau komt.
I will never let her talk	Ik sil har noait prate litte
He should do it now.	Hy soe no dwaan moatte.
I was just a little surprised	Ik wie gewoan wat ferrast
It was given to him	It waard him jûn
I feel a little bad, but not too much	Ik fiel my in bytsje min, mar net te folle
Give them what they want.	Jou har wat se wolle.
Let us be great friends.	Lit ús grutte freonen wêze.
I leave my door open.	Ik lit myn doar iepen.
I said something like.	Ik sei wat as.
You, me, everyone.	Jo, ik, elkenien.
They can be, of course.	Se kinne fansels wêze.
I want you there with me	Ik wol dy dêr by my
They did not work.	Se hawwe net wurke.
I can not do that.	Ik kin dat net dwaan.
We had no reason to hurt her.	Wy hiene gjin reden om har sear te dwaan.
I'm fine.	Ik haw goed.
I think you are something else	Ik tink dat jo wat oars binne
Or the road.	Of de wei.
I wonder what he will do about it.	Ik freegje my ôf wat er der oan dwaan sil.
I wanted to be sure	Ik woe der wis fan wêze
It's not for me.	It is net foar my.
Nobody wanted her to see that.	Nimmen woe dat se dat seach.
We'll see if it's done.	Wy sille sjen dat it dien wurdt.
I wanted this, whatever it was	Ik woe dit, wat it ek wie
He soon got used to it.	Hy wenne der gau oan.
She was gone.	Se wie fuort.
But that was a long time ago.	Mar dat wie lang lyn.
The house is still there.	It hûs stiet der noch.
It's going well.	It giet goed.
He had never been to her house before.	Hy hie noch noait earder yn har hûs west.
Leave that to the other person.	Lit dat oan de oare persoan oer.
It was just.	It wie gewoan.
I feel for the new girl	Ik fiel my mei it nije famke
He felt like he had actually been there.	Hy fielde as hie er der eins west.
You have the right man.	Jo hawwe de goede man.
It was not entirely on its own.	It wie net hielendal op himsels.
Up, and sat in the office all morning.	Op, en siet de hiele moarn op it kantoar.
That's what the meeting is about.	Dêr giet de gearkomste oer.
I just want you to take him to her	Ik wol gewoan dat jo him nei har nimme
Must be the last.	Moat de lêste wêze.
Hope to see you there !.	Hoopje dy dêr te sjen!.
I was the last to be seen with her	Ik wie de lêste dy't mei har sjoen waard
I'm scared of them both now	Ik bin no bang foar se beide
He tried to talk.	Hy besocht te praten.
Go get ready.	Gean meitsje klear.
I do not need you anymore	Ik haw dy net mear nedich
I really like this guy	Ik hâld fan dizze keardel eins
I'm having a meeting in an hour	Ik haw in gearkomste oer in oere
I needed her in my life	Ik hie har nedich yn myn libben
But that would take time.	Mar dat soe tiid nimme.
I suppose it would not hurt	Ik nim oan dat it net sear dwaan soe
Now we are in bed.	No binne wy ​​op bêd.
But in time, they will.	Mar op 'e tiid sille se.
Do this and that.	Doch dit en dat.
And you have to be very careful.	En jo moatte tige foarsichtich wêze.
I do not know what you have been waiting for.	Ik wit net wêr't jo op wachte hawwe.
I waited until he left, but he did not	Ik wachte oant er fuort soe, mar hy die net
You're not her mother.	Do bist har mem net.
I'll wait and see how he does	Ik sil wachtsje en sjen hoe't hy docht
I still play it every now and then	Ik spylje it noch sa no en dan
I love you a lot	Ik hâld in protte fan dy
That's what I'll give it.	Dat sil ik it jaan.
See me as food.	Sjoch my as iten.
I have to tell you something in person	Ik moat dy wat yn persoan fertelle
We are needed.	Wy binne nedich.
I know we have a lot to talk about	Ik wit dat wy in protte hawwe om oer te praten
I told my parents the same thing	Ik fertelde myn âlden itselde ding
But not with this movie.	Mar net mei dizze film.
I hope you get better soon	Ik hoopje dat jo gau better wurde
I do not even know what happened.	Ik wit net iens wat der bard is.
I had nothing to eat	Ik hie neat iten
I had not worked with her before	Ik wurke net earder mei har
All I want is to be with you again.	Alles wat ik wol is wer by dy te wêzen.
It's every day.	It is alle dagen.
But that was the problem.	Mar dat wie it probleem.
How he was.	Hoe't hy wie.
I always thought.	Ik haw altyd tocht.
This is truth.	Dit is wierheid.
I really was not worried about the money	Ik wie echt net soargen oer it jild
You are here to stay.	Jo binne hjir om te bliuwen.
They were nice.	Se wiene aardich.
I can see it so clearly now	Ik kin it no sa dúdlik sjen
I'll take care of that today.	Ik sil der hjoed foar soargje.
I wonder what it will be like	Ik freegje my ôf hoe't it wêze sil
You're not a father.	Do bist gjin heit.
You do not want to know either.	Jo wolle it ek net witte.
I have not told him yet	Ik haw it him noch net ferteld
She looked at the girl again.	Se seach it famke wer oan.
There is much more to them than this.	Der is folle mear oan har as dit.
They said the man had no chance.	Se seine dat de man gjin kâns hat.
We think about things.	Wy tinke oer dingen.
I should have told you that a long time ago	Ik hie it dy no al lang earder fertelle moatten
I did not have to talk.	Ik hoegde net te praten.
Only two years from now.	Noch mar twa jier fan no.
But here it was.	Mar hjir wie it.
I see them every day	Ik sjoch se alle dagen
I could even go.	Ik koe sels gean.
There was something good.	Der wie wat goed.
I said nothing.	Ik sei neat.
But we will do well.	Mar wy sille it goed dwaan.
Makes me off.	Makket my ôf.
I can get on with it from here on out	Ik kin der fan hjir ôf oan
She can not go home.	Se kin net nei hûs.
He looks at me, then he looks away.	Hy sjocht my oan, dan sjocht er fuort.
I can not keep him at home.	Ik kin him net thús hâlde.
I was even so scared	Ik wie sels sa bang
I think he did.	Ik tink dat hy die.
A little more, he thought	In bytsje mear, tocht er
I thought of her.	Ik tocht oan har.
No other way around it.	Gjin oare manier om it hinne.
And that felt true.	En dat fielde wier.
I did not like how he looked	Ik mocht net leuk hoe't er seach
I would never be that woman again	Ik soe dy frou noait wer wêze
I can see that no one has	Ik kin sjen dat gjinien hat
It did not seem to me a good idea.	It like my gjin goed idee.
I put them all in front of her	Ik sette se allegear foar har
I've only talked to her a few times.	Ik haw mar in pear kear mei har praat.
But, that really happened.	Mar, dat is echt bard.
I think absolutely nothing	Ik tink hielendal neat
I think they are better apart	Ik tink dat se better út elkoar binne
You will work here, and you will work hard.	Jo sille hjir wurkje, en jo sille hurd wurkje.
I never know how to do this	Ik wit noait hoe't ik dit moat
But he did know.	Mar hy wist wol.
That's just a name.	Dat is mar in namme.
I hope you agree with our thoughts as well	Ik hoopje dat jo ek mei ús gedachten iens binne
I would not want him	Ik soe him net wolle
She told me she was very good and very happy.	Se fertelde my dat se heul goed wie en heul bliid.
I think the couple was sitting there	Ik tink dat it pear dêr siet
I was a mother now.	Ik wie no mem.
I assume she does not have it	Ik nim oan dat se it net hat
Driving makes me tired.	It riden makket my wurch.
Just ask my mom.	Freegje myn mem mar.
Reading was fun.	It lêzen wie leuk.
We only have to make it one week.	Wy hoege it noch mar ien wike te meitsjen.
But they are in trouble.	Mar se binne yn de problemen.
You have to do it yourself.	Jo moatte it sels dwaan.
A man should not be a problem	In man soe gjin probleem wêze moatte
Make the most of your way.	Meitsje it bêste fan jo wei.
I make more money than he does.	Ik meitsje mear jild as hy docht.
There is not enough money.	Der is net genôch jild.
I had a little hair now	Ik hie no in bytsje hier
I saw what no one else did	Ik seach wat nimmen oars die
He's coming back tomorrow	Hy komt moarn werom
After the meeting, you can do that.	Nei de gearkomste kinne jo dat dwaan.
I could not live here	Ik koe hjir net wenje
I will not let another of my children get sick.	Ik sil net dat in oare fan myn bern siik wurde.
I will not be afraid	Ik sil net bang wêze
I want to talk to you and your wife	Ik wol mei dy en dyn frou prate
He is in everything.	Hy is yn alles.
We know everything about you.	Wy witte alles oer dy.
That's right.	Dat is krekt.
I worry about them	Ik meitsje my soargen oer har
I did not give it to her	Ik ha it har net jûn
I really do not know where the time went.	Ik wit echt net wêr't de tiid gie.
To be there when she needed one.	Om der te wêzen as se ien nedich wie.
Try giving me an hour.	Besykje my in oere te jaan.
I want you too	Ik wol dy ek wol
I'm glad to see you all are well	Ik bin bliid om te sjen dat jo allegear goed binne
I did not know how to ask	Ik wist net hoe't ik freegje moast
That would be really sick.	Dat soe wier siik wêze.
I was out there.	Ik wie der út.
Please help me.	Help my asjebleaft.
I'm ready, he thought.	Ik bin klear foar, tocht er.
I knew she must be mad at me	Ik wist dat se lilk op my wêze moast
Really, there was not much more for me to do.	Echt, d'r wie net folle mear foar my te dwaan.
It was clear they were out of time.	It wie dúdlik dat se út 'e tiid wiene.
That needs to be done.	Dat moat dien wurde.
I will not stay there at all	Ik sil der hielendal net bliuwe
I could find no problems	Ik koe fine gjin problemen
And you get a lot out of it.	En jo krije der in protte fan.
I had to get there	Ik moast der komme
She hopes that will happen soon.	Se hope dat dat gau barre soe.
I had to get in there	Ik moast der yn
I found it clear where the book was going	Ik fûn it dúdlik wêr't it boek hinne gie
Quite an old man.	Hiel in âld man.
No one had told people to leave.	Nimmen hie minsken sein om fuort te gean.
I need to know exactly who he is	Ik moat krekt witte wa't er is
I'm glad you said that.	Ik bin bliid dat jo dat sein hawwe.
I was at work.	Ik wie oan it wurk.
They have always been there for me.	Se hawwe der altyd foar my west.
I have to go back to school	Ik moat werom nei skoalle
She said she knew.	Se sei dat se wist.
I never thought it would be me.	Ik hie noait tocht dat it my wêze soe.
I can not say for tomorrow	Ik kin it net sizze foar moarn
But nothing worked for me.	Mar neat wurke foar my.
She was not ordinary.	Se wie net gewoan.
It's good to have them back.	It is goed om se werom te hawwen.
I think she's afraid of water	Ik tink dat se bang is foar wetter
That's what I leave to you.	Dat lit ik oan dy oer.
I was even a little scared	Ik wie sels in bytsje bang
This man is not one of those things.	Dizze man is net ien fan dy dingen.
Probably for money.	Wierskynlik foar jild.
I would love to do it	Ik soe it graach dwaan
I know you have visited here	Ik wit dat jo hjir besocht hawwe
I could not do this myself	Ik koe dit net sels dwaan
The man died.	De man kaam om.
I only found two of them	Ik haw der mar twa fan fûn
The only problem is that it only works for once.	It ienige probleem is dat it wurket mar foar ien kear.
I was not yet in the clear	Ik wie noch net yn it dúdlik
I told him what my father had just said	Ik fertelde him wat myn heit krekt sein hie
I found my father difficult.	Ik fûn myn heit dreech.
I know what you want to say if you could	Ik wit wat jo sizze wolle as jo koene
I wanted to go back a long time ago	Ik woe al lang werom
Well, do not come back to us.	No, kom net werom nei ús.
I need you to tell me everything	Ik haw jo nedich om my alles te fertellen
From both.	Fan beide wei.
We made this.	Wy hawwe dit makke.
I wanted to get more out of him	Ik woe mear út him krije
I tried to say his name	Ik besocht syn namme te sizzen
I know it will happen	Ik wit it sil barre
She was not real.	Se wie net echt.
It comes down to the same thing.	It komt op itselde.
This is not about one big bad this year.	Dit is net oer ien grutte min dit jier.
And life is not for that.	En dêr is it libben net foar.
I've never seen that happen	Dat haw ik nea barre sjoen
I want you to say this to me.	Ik wol dat jo dit nei my sizze.
I just had to get it out of there	Ik moast it der mar út
I opened it again in the car	Ik die it wer iepen yn 'e auto
That should never have happened.	Dat hie nea barre moatten.
I will not look at you	Ik sil net nei dy sjen
I think he knew it.	Ik tink dat hy it wist.
That's what I'll try.	Dat sil ik besykje.
I can not get to the food.	Ik kin net by it iten komme.
She certainly does not talk to us.	Se praat wis net mei ús.
The last time we were together, she said.	De lêste kear dat wy tegearre wiene, sei se.
No problem with that.	Gjin probleem mei dat.
They show who we are.	Se litte sjen wa't wy binne.
They do not live here.	Se wenje hjir net.
Things were really better.	Dingen wiene echt better.
I did not want anyone to scare me	Ik woe net dat ien my bang soe
They just tell the bad things, not the good ones.	Se fertelle gewoan de minne dingen, net de goede.
I just want better food	Ik wol gewoan better iten
I have to wait until tomorrow	Ik moat wachtsje oant moarn
That was her life, she said.	Dat wie har libben, sei se.
We are even afraid to talk	Wy binne sels bang om te praten
I expected nothing but this not	Ik ferwachte neat mar dit net
I for one, can not wait.	Ik foar ien, kin net wachtsje.
I was afraid you might not believe me	Ik wie bang dat jo my miskien net leauwe
I almost did it myself.	Ik ha it sels hast dien.
You can go through this.	Jo kinne troch dit.
I can see them clearly	Ik kin se dúdlik sjen
I could see it so clearly	Ik koe it sa dúdlik sjen
I know you want this.	Ik wit dat jo dit wolle.
Which was good by us.	Wat wie goed troch ús.
I was ready to help.	Ik wie ree om te helpen.
I can not wait to get old	Ik kin net wachtsje om âld te wurden
She had clearly thought the same thing.	Se hie dúdlik itselde tocht.
It could not have come at a better time in my life.	It koe net op in bettere tiid yn myn libben komme.
I can not say what it is trying to go for	Ik kin net sizze wêr't it foar besykje te gean
It did no good.	It die gjin goed.
So let's do this thing together.	Dat litte wy dit ding tegearre dwaan.
I'm all you are	Ik bin alles wat jo binne
A few more hours or so.	Noch in pear oeren of sa.
That's the book.	Dat is it boek.
Anything can happen.	Alles kin barre.
I'm glad you saw it.	Ik bin bliid dat jo it sjoen hawwe.
My husband is.	Myn man is.
I just had to have him	Ik moast him mar hawwe
I did a lot this evening	Ik die dizze jûn in protte oan
I know where he's going	Ik wit wêr't er hinne giet
I walked here.	Ik rûn hjir.
I know it and he knows it	Ik wit it en hy wit it
Just do something.	Doch gewoan wat.
You can come back to that too.	Jo kinne der ek op werom komme.
He was home again.	Hy wie wer thús.
It was now clear to us what had happened.	It wie ús no dúdlik wat der bard wie.
I know what they're talking about	Ik wit wêr't se it oer hawwe
They are very beautiful.	Se binne hiel moai.
In the same place maybe, but never together.	Op itselde plak miskien, mar nea tegearre.
I should have said something earlier	Ik hie earder wat sizze moatten
In a photo or a book.	In foto of in boek.
I needed her to tell me that all would be well	Ik hie har nedich om my te fertellen dat alles goed soe wêze
The room looked like something out of a movie.	De keamer like wat út in film.
I make a lot of it	Ik meitsje der in protte fan
I'm not telling her that.	Dat fertel ik har net.
It is clear that the child loves that man.	It is dúdlik dat it bern fan dy man hâldt.
I really enjoyed it.	Ik hie it echt.
My thoughts go out to you.	Myn gedachten geane út nei dy.
I was really worried about you, actually	Ik wie echt soargen oer dy, eins
Feel free to do it as much as necessary.	Fiel jo frij om it safolle as nedich te dwaan.
I had to do this	Ik moast dit dwaan
And it went on.	En it gie troch.
It was too late to go back now.	It wie te let om no werom te gean.
We know what anyone can do.	Wy witte wat elkenien kin dwaan.
He just said he did it.	Hy sei krekt dat hy it die.
Neither was scared.	Gjin fan beide wie bang.
I'll take you back	Ik nim dy werom
He has no children.	Hy hat gjin bern.
And waited, and waited.	En wachte, en wachte.
I saw no other way.	Ik seach gjin oare wei.
It's going well.	It komt goed.
He is a year old.	Hy is in jier âld.
Take what you want.	Nim wat jo wolle.
And the mother.	En de mem.
And there's something else.	En der is noch wat.
I have a letter here, from my father.	Ik ha hjir in brief, fan myn heit.
I did not even do that	Dat haw ik net iens dien
My husband does not father your children.	Myn man hat dyn bern net heit.
Of course not.	Dat die se fansels net.
I've worked it out before.	Ik haw it earder wurke.
But that animal thinks so too.	Mar dat bist tinkt ek.
And maybe not for long.	En miskien net lang.
I was not really scared	Ik wie net echt bang
For her family is very good.	Foar har famylje is heul goed.
I knew she would be fine	Ik wist dat se goed wêze soe
And she was angry too.	En se wie ek lilk.
I hope it works somehow.	Ik hoopje dat it op ien of oare manier wurket.
They would be fine.	Se soene fine.
It's beautiful.	It is moai.
We have enough time.	Wy hawwe genôch tiid.
I knew it was for me	Ik wist dat it foar my hie
Money came in and went out.	Jild kaam yn en gie út.
You are not easy to find.	Jo binne net maklik te finen.
I wonder if he knows if mom works here	Ik freegje my ôf oft er wit oft mem hjir wurket
Help me do that.	Help my dat te dwaan.
I always wondered how she did this	Ik frege my altyd ôf hoe't se dit die
Let's say one hour.	Litte wy sizze ien oere.
He had said nothing more.	Hy hie neat mear sein.
I had not seen one	Ik hie net ien sjoen
People will not even really see it.	Minsken sille net iens echt sjen.
This was not what he expected to find.	Dit wie net wat hy ferwachte te finen.
I will be good for nothing	Ik sil foar neat goed wêze
I was not ready for this	Ik wie hjir net klear foar
I was not even angry at him	Ik wie net iens lilk op him
I have not read much of it	Ik haw der net folle fan lêzen
That he he I.	Dat die hy ek.
I want to love people	Ik wol fan minsken hâlde
I know what it wants.	Ik wit wat it wol.
You and me.	Do en ik.
I had to get out of here	Ik moast hjir út komme
It does not matter how much.	It makket neat út hoefolle.
I knew he wanted to do other things	Ik wist dat hy oare dingen dwaan woe
Easy to make, easy to eat.	Maklik te meitsjen, maklik te iten.
Here she comes.	Hjir komt se.
I was like that.	Ik wie sa.
It felt good to say it.	It fielde goed om it te sizzen.
I hope it goes well	Ik hoopje dat it goed komt
My mother did not.	Myn mem net.
He had to look twice.	Hy moast twa kear sjen.
I know enough not to do that.	Ik wit genôch om dat net te dwaan.
I need him to help me	Ik haw him nedich om my te helpen
That was the right thing to do.	Dat wie it goede ding om te dwaan.
If it goes well, we tell our parents.	As it goed giet, fertelle wy ús âlden.
I would like to know more than this	Ik soe mear witte wolle as dit
I could not see into it.	Ik koe der net yn sjen.
I still do not today	Ik noch net hjoed
A guy could only do so much	In keardel koe mar safolle dwaan
I plan to do the same this year	Ik bin fan plan dit jier itselde te dwaan
I had really tried	Ik hie echt besocht
I can see so much this way	Ik kin safolle sjen op dizze manier
We'll be sure.	Wy sille der wis fan wêze.
I'm glad you like it	Ik bin bliid dat jo it leuk fine
I have no idea who my parents are	Ik haw gjin idee wa't myn âlden binne
I could not believe it would ever be the same	Ik koe net leauwe dat it oait itselde wêze soe
He will win, somehow.	Hy sil winne, op ien of oare manier.
Well, not at all.	No, net hielendal.
They had no idea why they were here.	Se hiene gjin idee wêrom't se hjir wiene.
I said what he thinks	Ik sei wat er tinkt
I'm sure it's the same for him.	Ik bin der wis fan dat it itselde is foar him.
I did not plan to stay out long	Ik wie net fan plan om lang út te bliuwen
This should be clear to everyone.	Dit moat foar elkenien dúdlik wêze.
I live with my parents	Ik wenje by myn âlden
It would be difficult.	It soe dreech wêze.
Did it only a few times.	Die it mar in pear kear.
There was nothing that these people would not do.	D'r wie neat dy't dizze minsken net dwaan soene.
But it's not for me.	Mar it is net foar my.
I can not think of anyone else	Ik kin net oan immen oars tinke
I doubt they want to do that	Ik twifelje oan dat se dat dwaan wolle
But it really works.	Mar it wurket echt.
That's nice.	Dat is moai.
I need someone to take her place.	Ik haw ien nedich om har plak yn te nimmen.
A house is just a house	In hûs is gewoan in hûs
Time does not matter.	De tiid makket neat út.
I could not see where you were going	Ik koe net sjen wêr't jo hinne wiene
I can help you get them back	Ik kin jo helpe om har werom te krijen
It should not ask too much, really.	It soe net te folle freegje moatte, echt.
I wish she knew how to make it.	Ik winskje dat se wist hoe te meitsjen it.
And that also seemed like a good life to me.	En dat like my ek in goed libben.
I acted just like it would be like a friend	Ik die krekt as it soe wêze as in freon
I took in too much.	Ik naam te folle op.
Look at something else.	Sjoch nei wat oars.
Hope is a woman who does good.	Hope is in frou dy't goed docht.
It's her who he wants.	It is har wa't er wol.
I have to go.	Ik moat fuort.
I think it's not bad.	Ik tink dat it net min is.
The truth is realized.	De wierheid wurdt realisearre.
Do this first.	Doch dit earst.
I'm all dad could never be	Ik bin alles heit nea koe wêze
I should be happy about that	Dêr soe ik bliid om wêze moatte
I pick her up carefully, careful not to hurt her	Ik nim har foarsichtich op, foarsichtich om har net sear te dwaan
I just did not expect it	Ik hie it gewoan net ferwachte
I'm interested in your work	Ik bin ynteressearre yn jo wurk
I had never seen that before.	Dat hie ik noch noait earder sjoen.
I can always see about your work when it's ready	Ik kin altyd oer jo wurk sjen as it klear is
We did our job.	Wy diene ús wurk.
I feel her.	Ik fiel har.
He knew what that would be.	Hy wist wat dat soe.
As if looking back at him.	As seach it werom nei him.
I have family around me	Ik haw famylje om my hinne
I thought this was a good idea	Ik tocht dat dit in goed idee wie
One has never been seen again	Ien is nea wer sjoen
I really do not know what to do now	Ik wit echt net wat ik no dwaan moat
And it worked well.	En it wurke goed.
Everything that would come to say about her was true.	Alles wat oer har te sizzen komme soe, wie wier.
I'm really looking forward to it.	Ik sjoch der echt nei út.
This is work.	Dit is wurk.
They will know how careful they should be.	Se sille witte hoe foarsichtich se moatte gean.
We have to wait again.	Wy moatte wer wachtsje.
I'll take that all back now	Dat nim ik no allegear werom
Somehow nothing happened to her.	Op ien of oare manier rekke neat fan har.
Never a bad thing.	Nea in min ding.
Both in one year.	Beide yn ien jier.
I'm not sure what they've been waiting for.	Ik bin der net wis fan wêr't se earder op wachte hawwe.
I came back and took them	Ik kaam werom en naam se
I used to always be tired	Ik wie eartiids altyd wurch
I would love to see them and see them work.	Ik soe graach sjen se en sjoch se wurkje.
I had not seen it for a long time	Ik hie it lang net sjoen
I did nothing	Ik haw neat dien
Exactly.	Krekt.
We want to be here.	Wy wolle hjir wêze.
I told this to my friends	Ik fertelde dit oan myn freonen
I was still.	Ik wie noch.
I did not know him after all	Ik koe him nei alle gedachten net
I found something even better	Ik fûn wat noch better
It works there if you could find it.	It wurk dêr as jo koe fine it.
But that's all there is to it.	Mar dêr is alles oer.
I had to go back soon.	Ik moast gau werom.
I'm an old man.	Ik bin in âld man.
They would be read a lot.	Se soene in protte lêzen wurde.
He will probably be fine.	Hy sil wierskynlik goed wêze.
I only have a little time	Ik haw mar in bytsje tiid
Talk to me.	Praat tsjin my.
I was different than my past this time	Ik wie oars as myn ferline dizze kear
I really did not think there had been such a woman.	Ik tocht echt net dat der sa'n frou west hie.
It was one of the few things that could not happen.	It wie ien fan de pear dingen dy't net barre koe.
This year, people are saying exactly the same thing.	Dit jier sizze minsken krekt itselde.
Let's look at this.	Litte wy hjir nei sjen.
I came to take back what is mine	Ik kaam om werom te nimmen wat fan my is
You can see the house.	Jo kinne it hûs sjen.
I had no idea this could be done	Ik hie gjin idee dat dit dien wurde koe
We have to make it work.	Wy moatte it wurk meitsje.
That, of course, is also true.	Dat is fansels ek wier.
I want to have a family	Ik wol in famylje hawwe
I know it's hard for her	Ik wit dat it dreech is foar har
I have the same problems	Ik haw deselde problemen
He has my hair.	Hy hat myn hier.
I wanted to know even more.	Ik woe noch mear witte.
I think it should be very soon	Ik tink dat it hiel gau wêze moat
Tell me what it's like for you.	Fertel my hoe't it foar dy is.
I did not want to see you	Ik woe dy net sjen
I could not believe her	Ik koe har net leauwe
I can not believe anyone would do this	Ik kin net leauwe dat immen dit soe dwaan
I was not just trying to get away	Ik besocht net krekt fuort te kommen
A big city, very lively	In grutte stêd, tige libben
He knew me my whole life.	Hy koe my myn hiele libben.
My girl loves this kind of thing.	Myn famke hâldt fan dit soarte fan dingen.
I can not say enough about her work	Ik kin net genôch sizze oer har wurk
I was not sure that was what you expected	Ik wie der net wis fan dat wie wat jo ferwachte
Maybe she was too hard on her.	Miskien wie se te hurd foar har.
He does not know otherwise.	Hy wit net oars.
I could not make you happy	Ik koe dy net bliid meitsje
I can make this clear to him.	Ik kin him dit dúdlik meitsje.
Nothing hurt more.	Neat die mear sear.
It stands in the way.	It stiet yn 'e wei.
Me to you.	My nei dy.
I want him to know that	Ik wol dat er dat wit
A friend of mine knows him well.	In freon fan my ken him goed.
I'm not going out.	Ik gean net út.
I should not see this	Ik soe dit net moatte sjen
We are happy to help !.	Wy binne bliid om te helpen!.
I see you again	Ik sjoch dy wer
The words you said first.	De wurden dy't jo earst seine.
I hope it's okay with your family	Ik hoopje dat it goed is mei jo famylje
I did not want it	Ik woe it net
I hope you have found that place already	Ik hoopje dat jo dat plak al fûn hawwe
He became interested.	Hy rekke ynteressearre.
I can not believe this.	Ik kin dit net leauwe.
I have always liked it	Ik haw it altyd leuk fûn
It was more than just about reading.	It gie mear dan allinnich oer it lêzen.
We will do it again now.	Wy sille it no wer dwaan.
I just want her to know how true that is	Ik wol gewoan dat se wit hoe wier dat is
Bye bye .	Oant sjen .
I can not think of it now	Ik kin der no net oan tinke
Nothing like this has ever happened at my place.	Neat as dit is ea bard by myn plak.
I only remember that day	Ik wit noch mar dy dei
I could not let him	Ik koe him net litte
Make it work.	Meitsje it wurk.
There you can get better.	Dêr kinne jo better wurde.
I would not know what I would say to him	Ik soe net witte wat ik tsjin him sizze soe
What it does.	Wat it docht.
He has money.	Hy hat jild.
I hope he would be back soon	Ik hope dat hy gau werom soe
I just need to stop watching you	Ik moat gewoan ophâlde mei dy te sjen
I love questions about my bike	Ik hâld fan fragen oer myn fyts
I think he is our only hope	Ik tink dat hy ús ienige hope is
You might want to be.	Jo kinne wol wêze.
I just was not sure it was a good idea	Ik wie gewoan net wis dat it in goed idee wie
A lot of people didn’t get that much	In protte minsken krigen net safolle
I can not do this to her	Ik kin har dit net dwaan
I will probably just show up and hope for the best.	Ik sil nei alle gedachten gewoan sjen litte en hoopje op it bêste.
I talked to him.	Ik haw mei him praat.
More work, more made.	Mear wurke, mear makke.
I know them.	Ik ken se.
We will not.	Wy sille net .
This morning should have been so different.	Dizze moarn hie sa oars moatten.
I have no idea what kind of place this is	Ik ha gjin idee wat foar plak dit is
Let's hope so.	Litte wy dat hoopje.
I take care of my family.	Ik soargje foar myn famylje.
I wonder what happened to me	Ik freegje my ôf wat der mei my bard is
I could not see well.	Ik koe net goed sjen.
I only knew what he had told me, that's it	Ik wist allinnich wat er my sein hie, dat is it
Had her book out and all.	Hie har boek út en alles.
I really think it was the best.	Ik tink echt dat it it bêste wie.
The dog was careful.	De hûn wie foarsichtich.
You can not look away.	Jo kinne net fuort sjen.
I will not say much about this	Ik sil hjir net folle oer sizze
My mother did not buy it.	Myn mem kocht it net.
I can no longer eat	Ik kin net mear ite
He can not do without me.	Hy kin net sûnder my.
People are scared.	Minsken binne bang.
But that day can never come.	Mar dy dei kin nea komme.
I heard you were in town	Ik hearde dat jo yn 'e stêd wiene
He was very ill.	Hy wie tige siik.
I probably won't either	Ik sil wierskynlik ek net
But a lot happens.	Mar der bart in protte.
I need to say something soon	Ik moat gau wat sizze
One man was killed.	Ien man kaam om it libben.
It was just to get away from him.	It wie mar om by him ôf te kommen.
He could be the man.	Hy koe de man wêze.
My wife told me that.	Myn frou fertelde my dat.
I will show you many things	Ik sil jo in protte dingen sjen litte
Where you do not want it.	Wêr't jo it net wolle.
I want to see her one more time	Ik wol har noch ien kear sjen
I did not sit long when someone came to me	Ik siet net lang doe't der ien by my kaam
You're her father.	Do bist har heit.
My favorite time of the year.	Myn favorite tiid fan it jier.
I did not know who was to whom	Ik wist net wa't oan wa wie
So many children.	Safolle bern.
Bye for now!.	Oant sjen foar no!.
Good work, boy.	Goed wurk, jonge.
Can't go wrong if you do.	Kin net ferkeard gean as jo it dogge.
Or maybe the old man was just not interested.	Of miskien wie de âld man gewoan net ynteressearre.
Maybe that can help you.	Miskien kin dat jo helpe.
I could not see the people	Ik koe de minsken net sjen
I want to be open to people who tell me	Ik wol iepen wêze foar minsken dy't my fertelle
That's what's going to happen.	Dat is wat der barre sil.
His family is here with him.	Syn famylje is hjir by him.
And, of course, it is not.	En, fansels, is it net.
I know very well what she will say.	Ik wit goed wat se sizze sil.
I can no longer live here	Ik kin hjir net mear wenje
I tried to help him	Ik besocht him te helpen
Away from the morning.	Fan 'e moarn fuort.
That was the two of us.	Dat wiene wy ​​twa.
Man she looked good.	Man seach se der goed út.
I can say a good word of a bad one	Ik kin in goed wurd fan in min sizze
She knew who he was and what he was.	Se wist wa't hy wie en wat hy wie.
I did not ask him to come here	Ik haw him net frege om hjir te kommen
It was like her kind.	It wie as har soarte.
There is no way out.	Der is gjin wei út.
Truth be told some people think they are the same.	Wierheid wurde ferteld in pear minsken tinke dat se binne itselde.
I never had much of them	Ik hie nea folle fan har
He was talking.	Hy wie oan it praten.
I'm just a little.	Ik bin mar in bytsje.
He will not find you here.	Hy sil dy hjir net fine.
I thought we might know you	Ik tocht dat wy jo miskien witte kinne
By him.	Troch him.
I just want to see it over and over again.	Ik wol it gewoan oer en wer sjen.
Maybe you don't need it anymore, she said.	Miskien hast it net mear nedich, sei se.
She's not home.	Se is net thús.
Lots and lots of food.	In protte en in protte iten.
Now you are not alone.	No do bist net allinnich.
You should go try it.	Jo moatte gean besykje it.
I looked a little, see what she would do	Ik seach in bytsje, sjoch wat se dwaan soe
Someone from something sees him.	Immen fan wat sjocht him.
If it has.	As it hat.
I like to do this a lot.	Ik like te dwaan dit in protte.
I could see how much they needed to be together.	Ik koe sjen hoefolle se nedich om tegearre te wêzen.
There will be no other way to do it.	D'r sil gjin oare manier wêze om it te dwaan.
I'm gone.	Ik bin fuort.
I tried to figure it out	Ik besocht út te finen
I had a few friends and had a family	Ik hie in pear freonen en hie in famylje
She is also a nice girl.	Se is ek in aardich famke.
I was free to just be	Ik wie frij om gewoan te wêzen
It would have.	It soe hawwe.
I thought you would be better off	Ik tocht dat jo better wêze soene
She loves her wool.	Se hâldt har wol.
I tried to get it right	Ik besocht it goed te krijen
Well, he did it right.	No, hy die it goed.
I said, maybe tomorrow	Ik sei, miskien moarn
Now that would be something.	No soe dat wat wêze.
I can not go on and on	Ik kin net troch gean hinne en wer
I have many questions	Ik haw in protte fragen
Help me again to do what is good.	Help my wer om te dwaan wat goed is.
Not so long ago.	Net sa lang lyn.
And it works.	En it wurket.
I was not quite sure why he did that	Ik wie net hielendal wis wêrom hy dat die
It’s all the same work.	It is allegear itselde wurk.
I come here often to look after them	Ik kom hjir faak om nei har te sjen
I'm trying to make.	Ik besykje te meitsjen.
We are here to help !.	Wy binne hjir om te helpen!.
I already had one of those today.	Ik hie hjoed al ien fan dy.
Everyone saw what happened	Elkenien seach wat der barde
I would not see, nothing could make me	Ik soe net sjen, neat koe my meitsje
He came back to those people.	Hy kaam werom nei dy minsken.
That job is really made for you.	Dy baan is echt foar jo makke.
But well, here it is.	Mar goed, hjir is it.
If you do, your life will never be the same.	As jo ​​​​dat dogge, is jo libben noait itselde.
It's what we want.	It is wat wy wolle.
The children needed them now.	De bern hiene har no nedich.
I felt happy.	Ik fielde my bliid.
I know his house.	Ik ken syn hûs.
I had expected the same thing here.	Ik hie hjir itselde ferwachte.
For now and forever more.	Foar no en foar altyd mear.
I should have thought of that	Dêr hie ik oan tinke moatten
They had seen, not seen yet.	Se hiene sjoen, noch net sjoen.
We can eat or something.	Wy kinne te iten of sa.
I want to be the one who makes you happy	Ik wol dejinge wêze dy't jo bliid makket
I still have an hour of work left	Ik ha noch in oere wurk oer
But tell me more about it.	Mar fertel my der mear oer.
A child is a child.	In bern is in bern.
I think you have the picture.	Ik tink dat jo de foto hawwe.
I need to do something	Ik moat wat dwaan
Never came back.	Nea kaam werom.
I hope the time came soon	Ik hope dat de tiid gau kaam
Two people just could not be more different.	Twa minsken koene gewoan net mear oars wêze.
This is real.	Dit is echt.
Maybe they think the other time they do it twice.	Miskien tinke se de oare kear dat se it dogge twa kear.
I wish we knew about you sooner	Ik winskje dat wy earder oer jo wisten
They have to happen.	Se moatte barre.
I just want my boy home	Ik wol gewoan myn jonge thús
This can do some harm.	Dit kin wat sear dwaan.
I do not feel so good.	Ik fiel my net sa goed.
Maybe it would come in handy now.	Miskien soe it no wol goed komme.
No one could find it.	Nimmen koe it fine.
I have something.	Ik haw wat.
Now this young woman.	No dizze jonge frou.
I think you can do a lot more good things	Ik tink dat jo folle mear goede dingen kinne dwaan
My parents are not.	Myn âlden binne net.
I have not seen her in days.	Ik haw har al dagen net sjoen.
I think it was at the door of her house	Ik tink dat it by de doar fan har hûs wie
It had happened again.	It wie wer bard.
That has a lot to do with just a few words.	Dat is in protte te dwaan mei mar in pear wurden.
I love how easy it is	Ik hâld fan hoe maklik it is
I had to talk to you	Ik moast mei dy prate
I know she will not give me anything	Ik wit dat se my neat jaan sil
I did not have to say those things.	Ik hoegde dy dingen net te sizzen.
But you are not the same person you were.	Mar do bist net deselde persoan dy't jo wiene.
I'm so happy for your family.	Ik bin sa bliid foar jo famylje.
I was just not ready yet	Ik wie gewoan noch net klear
I have to tell you we need more time	Ik moat dy sizze dat wy mear tiid nedich hawwe
I can be very, very good to my friends	Ik kin heul, heul goed wêze foar myn freonen
How can this be done ?, you may ask.	Hoe kin dit dien wurde?, kinne jo freegje.
I should have found her, she said.	Ik hie har fine moatten, sei se.
But it obviously works for him	Mar it wurket fansels foar him
I should have had a way to talk back.	Ik hie in manier moatten hawwe om werom te praten.
I will not believe her	Ik sil har net leauwe
Let's see you when you return.	Kom ús sjen as jo werom binne.
The food was almost gone.	It iten wie hast fuort.
That seems clear.	Dat liket dúdlik.
I know where she is	Ik wit wêr't se is
But no one was against the idea.	Mar gjinien wie tsjin it idee.
I had him here	Ik hie him hjir
A woman does this to me	In frou docht my dit oan
I want to know how well he's doing.	Ik wol witte hoe goed it mei him giet.
He touched one.	Hy rekke ien oan.
Kids still need to know.	Bern moatte it noch witte.
It actually hurt to say that.	It die eins sear om dat te sizzen.
Not the thing done.	Net it dien ding.
I'll wake the kids	Ik sil de bern wekker meitsje
Maybe a lot.	Miskien in protte.
And no one with.	En gjinien mei.
I felt so much better about her	Ik fielde my safolle better mei har om
Other than that, it looks very nice.	Oars as dat sjocht it der hiel moai út.
I feel like she does not love me enough	Ik fiel dat se net genôch fan my hâldt
He sees her coming to the door.	Hy sjocht har by de doar komme.
But it was not to be found.	Mar it wie net te finen.
And it gave me hope.	En it joech my hope.
You have a friend.	Jo hawwe in freon.
All those things were true.	Al dy dingen wiene wier.
I think he's not home	Ik tink dat er net thús is
I could not believe what we just did there	Ik koe net leauwe wat wy dêr krekt dien hawwe
I would never have said anything.	Ik soe noait wat sein hawwe.
I will probably play it again soon.	Ik sil it wierskynlik gau wer spylje.
I had nothing more to do with it	Ik hie der neat mear om
I wondered what he made of it all	Ik frege my ôf wat er fan dit alles makke
I know where he will be.	Ik wit wêr't er wêze sil.
I know it and it has to be said	Ik wit it en it moat sein wurde
I have other things.	Ik haw oare dingen.
He would not be able to buy.	Hy soe net kinne keapje.
There's something else in me.	Der is wat oars yn my.
Will this work for you.	Sil dit foar jo wurkje.
It's who we are.	It is wa't wy binne.
I can see how much you love her	Ik kin sjen hoefolle jo fan har hâlde
Get over it.	Lit it gean.
I was not there for him	Ik wie der net foar him
I know you have a busy life	Ik wit dat jo in drok libben hawwe
I love him and he is my dog.	Ik hâld fan him en hy is myn hûn.
It must be me.	It moat my wêze.
I still can not stand it	Dat kin ik noch mar net oan
Do not know we can see it.	Wit net dat wy it sjen kinne.
I have to tell you.	Ik moat it dy fertelle.
I knew it was going to go into this	Ik wist it gean yn dit
I would be the one talking to her	Ik soe dejinge wêze dy't mei har praat
I knew what he was doing.	Ik wist wat er die.
You will know who you are.	Jo sille witte wa't jo binne.
I would not let that happen again	Ik soe dat net wer barre litte
They will not get it.	Se sille it net krije.
It's a good question.	It is in goede fraach.
I never even realized it	Ik haw it sels noait realisearre
Ask it then.	Freegje it dan.
I can give them to you.	Ik kin se jo jaan.
This was good.	Dit wie goed.
But let no one tell you that it will be easy.	Mar lit gjinien jo fertelle dat it maklik sil wêze.
Look for it !.	Sjoch foar it!.
But not just by saying it.	Mar net allinnich troch it te sizzen.
I wondered where he had been	Ik frege my ôf wêr't er west hie
I would live with her.	Ik soe by har wenje.
That was it for him.	Dat wie it foar him.
I do not know, but it is possible.	Ik wit it net, mar it kin wol.
How to make it.	Hoe meitsje it.
We will have to stop there.	Dêr sille wy ophâlde moatte.
It shows that you really know nothing about it.	It lit sjen dat jo der echt neat fan witte.
I'm just doing my job.	Ik doch gewoan myn wurk.
That is not the question that is going on here.	Dat is net de fraach dy't hjir giet.
There could be a better way.	D'r kin in bettere manier wêze.
I never told anyone about that meeting	Ik haw noait immen oer dy gearkomste ferteld
And life goes on !.	En it libben giet troch!.
The money would come.	It jild soe komme.
They really do.	Dat diene se echt.
I told her to take her mother	Ik fertelde har om har mem te nimmen
I took it to him.	Ik naam it nei him.
Let me look at you.	Lit my nei dy sjen.
I had not thought of that	Dêr hie ik net oan tocht
I know everything about her	Ik wit alles oer har
And who it can be.	En wa't it wêze kin.
I think that's the best	Ik tink dat is it bêste
He would have to be hard to figure out what happens next.	Hy soe hurd wêze moatte om út te finen wat der dan bart.
We do it all the time.	Wy dogge it de hiele tiid.
But those two were one.	Mar dy twa wiene ien.
Then you can eat.	Dan kinne jo ite.
Maybe he's coming with his husband.	Miskien komt er mei syn man.
I just really need to know	Ik moat it gewoan echt witte
I know you get it	Ik wit dat jo it krije
I was just trying to stay alive	Ik besocht gewoan yn libben te bliuwen
You're way too nice.	Do bist folle te aardich.
I'm going that way.	Ik gean by dy wei.
He had a job to do.	Hy hie in wurk te dwaan.
Do home.	Doch thús.
I've had enough of that in my life.	Dêr haw ik genôch fan dien yn myn libben.
Those have just become.	Dat binne gewoan wurden.
Nothing to see here.	Neat te sjen hjir.
No one should try it	Nimmen moat it besykje
Think about it, say that to a child.	Tink der oer, sizze dat tsjin in bern.
I knew she would come back	Ik wist dat se werom soe komme
He also works pretty hard for some reason.	Hy wurket om ien of oare reden ek aardich hurd.
I'll have to do something about that	Dêr sil ik wat oan dwaan moatte
I know everyone here	Ik ken elkenien hjir
A really bad time.	In echt minne tiid.
I think he found us that way	Ik tink dat hy ús sa fûn
They always made trouble.	Se makke altyd problemen.
Said he does not know too much about it.	Sei hy wit net te folle oer it.
I need you to help me.	Ik haw jo nedich om my te helpen.
I thought of my children.	Ik tocht oan myn bern.
You get better.	Jo wurde better.
But it's not one of me.	Mar it is net ien fan my.
I was not a mother	Ik wie gjin mem
There it is.	Dêr is it.

I have to do this	Ik moat dit dwaan
I will for sure.	Ik sil wis.
I just want to help you	Ik wol dy gewoan helpe

Your house could handle more.	Jo hûs koe mear oan.
What's more, you might not even know why.	Wat mear is, jo miskien ek net witte wêrom.
Or wait, he says something else.	Of wachtsje, hy seit wat oars.

I did not agree with the man	Ik koe de man net iens
One week has come and gone.	Ien wike is kommen en gien.

He had seen a few things when he was there.	Hy hie in pear dingen sjoen doe't er dêr wie.
He was of the other kind.	Hy wie fan 'e oare soarte.
We had no one else to do them.	Wy hiene nimmen oars om se te dwaan.
Not sure why.	Net wis wêrom.
And I never looked back.	En ik seach noait werom.
I assume that will be enough to keep going	Ik nim oan dat dat genôch sil wêze om troch te gean
I have ridden both.	Ik haw beide riden.
I knew nothing yet	Ik wist noch neat
That is not the same as talking.	Dat is net itselde as it praten.
I never wanted to hurt her	Ik woe har noait sear dwaan
He saw nothing.	Hy seach neat.
There is no way out.	Der is gjin wei út.
But this is for real.	Mar dit is foar echt.
Says no word.	Seit gjin wurd.
I knew a lot of people	Ik koe in protte minsken
Something more is needed.	Der is wat mear nedich.
I only go once a month	Ik gean mar ien kear yn 'e moanne
I feel really good about our car	Ik fiel my echt goed oer ús auto

Not sure how it would play out.	Net wis hoe't it soe spylje.
She was something more.	Se wie wat mear.
And we want it to happen this year.	En wy wolle dat it dit jier bart.
I told him to stop and he would not	Ik fertelde him om op te hâlden en hy soe net
It will not make any money.	It sil gjin jild meitsje.
I'm just glad he's back.	Ik bin gewoan bliid dat er werom is.
I think he can help me	Ik tink dat hy my helpe kin
I was not in a good place.	Ik wie net op in goed plak.

I knew how they were	Ik wist hoe't se wiene
They seem pretty happy to me.	Se lykje my aardich bliid.
Let me know if you need anything.	Lit my witte as jo wat nedich binne.

She did not even want to know.	Se woe it sels net witte.
I needed my family and friends	Ik hie myn famylje en freonen nedich

I have no idea why it's there	Ik haw gjin idee wêrom't it dêr
He said he liked it a lot.	Hy sei dat er it in protte mocht.
I did not want you to know.	Ik woe net dat jo it wisten.
I'll have to get there one day	Ik sil der in dei komme moatte
That's what he wants to do.	Dat wol er dwaan.
Wait to find out.	Wachtsje om út te finen.
There was no one.	Der wie net ien.
I know it happened somehow	Ik wit dat it op ien of oare manier bard is

We have always been good, always.	Wy hawwe altyd goed west, altyd.
I'm so worried about him.	Ik bin sa soargen oer him.
I can not do this, not so	Ik kin dit net dwaan, net sa
The girl's father knew nothing about it.	De heit fan it famke wist der neat fan.
That's a very good thing.	Dat is in hiel goed ding.
He did not want to hurt me.	Hy woe my net sear dwaan.
I've told her so much about it	Ik haw har der safolle oer ferteld
I love the guy.	Ik hâld fan de keardel.
Place in a large bowl.	Plak yn in grutte kom.
I will go to work and do my job	Ik sil oan it wurk gean en myn wurk dwaan

I wish it was not true, but it is	Ik winskje dat it net wier wie, mar it is it
They think we need them.	Se tinke dat wy se nedich hawwe.

She can not believe her time has come.	Se kin net leauwe dat har tiid kommen is.
She may have a problem.	Se kin in probleem hawwe.
I'm never asked where the next path comes from.	Ik bin noait frege wêr't de folgjende wei komt.
This is like a new movie	Dit is as in nije film
I hope there could be someone.	Ik hope dat der immen wêze koe.
I'll talk to you a little bit about that	Ik sil oer in bytsje mei dy prate
Now tell me what you want.	No fertel my wat jo wolle.
Maybe there's nothing in it.	Miskien sit der neat yn.
I was just someone who watched.	Ik wie gewoan ien dy't seach.
It was so good to see him again.	It wie sa goed om him wer te sjen.
I should never do that	Dat soe ik noait dwaan moatte
He had good reason to be concerned.	Hy hie goede reden om soargen te wêzen.
I did not expect it.	Ik hie it net ferwachte.
I was just a kid being a kid	Ik wie mar in bern wêzen in bern
I could not, of course	Ik koe net, fansels
He was very careful though.	Hy wie wol hiel foarsichtich.
I had not eaten for three days	Ik hie trije dagen net iten
Never would be.	Nea soe wêze.
That makes me so happy.	Dat makket my sa bliid.
Your parents are not really your parents.	Jo âlden binne net echt jo âlden.
This was not difficult.	Dit wie net dreech.
Well, his whole family does.	No, syn hiele famylje docht.
This seems accurate, and probably a little better than expected.	Dit liket krekt, en wierskynlik in bytsje better dan ferwachte.
I do everything hard	Ik doch alles hurd
And there we are in agreement.	En dêr binne wy ​​it oer iens.

I have not even seen her in a few years	Ik haw har sels in pear jier net sjoen
I did not know what to do with it.	Ik wist net wat ik der mei oan moast.
He did not know much.	Hy wist net folle.
But look at it today.	Mar sjoch it hjoed.
I saw a lot of things	Ik seach in protte dingen
I was afraid to tell you	Ik wie bang om dy te fertellen
I will think of everything	Ik sil oan alles tinke
I did exactly what the letter said	Ik die krekt wat de brief sei
I want my life back, my friend back	Ik wol myn libben werom, myn freon werom
I asked her how late it was	Ik frege har hoe let it wie
I have no idea what to do.	Ik ha gjin idee om te dwaan.
This is the good thing.	Dit is it goede ding.
It was clearly very old and very well made.	It wie dúdlik hiel âld en hiel goed makke.
I need you in me	Ik haw dy yn my nedich
I'm not ready yet.	Ik bin noch net klear.
It was so beautiful though.	It wie wol sa moai.
It makes you a better person by having them.	It makket jo in better persoan troch se te hawwen.

But the problem is that it does not.	Mar it probleem is dat it net docht.
A whole lot.	In hiele protte.
I love her very much	Ik hâld tige fan har
Just as long as you.	Krekt sa lang as jo.
Not a good idea.	Gjin goed idee.
I had to work on it to wake him up	Ik moast der oan wurkje om him wekker te meitsjen
He's here.	Hy is hjir.
I still did not get a chance to tell her	Ik krige noch gjin kâns om it har te fertellen
And there was something else.	En der wie wat oars.
Of course we have to.	Fansels moatte wy.
All of these things would be fine.	Al dizze dingen soene goed wêze.
I knew her father.	Ik koe har heit.
You do not have to come.	Jo hoege net te kommen.
That is in a way for the good.	Dat is op in manier foar it goede.
Much more than you asked for.	Folle mear as jo frege om.
I think it should, but it does not	Ik tink dat it moat, mar it docht net
I will tell her that too	Dat sil ik har ek sizze
He said something.	Hy sei wat.
Not so anymore.	Net mear sa.
I just can not afford it	Ik kin it gewoan net betelje

I was not good with this man	Ik wie net goed mei dizze man
I just did not know what to tell her	Ik wist gewoan net wat ik har fertelle moast
I needed a job and still do it.	Ik hie in baan nedich en doch it noch.
The problem is that this is not entirely accurate.	It probleem is dat dit net hielendal krekt is.
I wanted to see more	Ik woe mear sjen
I do have another question though	Ik haw wol in oare fraach
She looked bad.	Se seach der min út.
I just need something to eat, that's all	Ik ha mar wat te iten nedich, dat is alles

I can not wait to see next year.	Ik kin net wachtsje om takom jier te sjen.

No problems so far.	Gjin problemen oant no ta.
Please help me.	Help my asjebleaft.
I put it to work at once	Ik sette it yn ien kear oan it wurk

I was not sure what to make of it	Ik wie der net wis fan wat ik der fan meitsje moast
Maybe now is not a good time to talk.	Miskien is no gjin goede tiid om te praten.

We take the time for you.	Wy nimme de tiid foar jo.
I had to stay home and work	Ik moast thús bliuwe en wurkje
I wish you would go with me	Ik winskje dat jo mei my geane
The people were good to us.	De minsken wiene goed foar ús.
Together they had those three children.	Tegearre hiene se dy trije bern.
We're getting there.	Wy komme der oan.
It just can not be you.	It kin gewoan net dy wêze.
It was time to talk.	It wie tiid om te praten.
That, itself, has its name.	Dat, sels, hat har namme.
They will not do, here.	Se sille net dwaan, hjir.
There was no reason to go home.	Der wie gjin reden om nei hûs te gean.
If that was even a thing.	As dat sels in ding wie.
You also do a lot of other things.	Jo dogge ek in protte oare dingen.
I thought it would always be so	Ik tocht dat it altyd sa wêze soe
They both go away.	Se geane beide fuort.
This was better than expected.	Dit wie better as ferwachte.
They will wait.	Se sille wachtsje.
I do not have time to come to you	Ik haw gjin tiid om nei dy te kommen
But he did not want the money on him either.	Mar hy woe it jild ek net op him ha.
I want to know where they come from	Ik wol witte wêr't se wei komme
You have to tell me what happened.	Jo moatte my fertelle wat der bard is.
Well, it's not the first time.	No, it is net de earste kear.
That was my problem doing the same thing.	Dat wie myn probleem dwaan itselde ding.
I knew what it was like	Ik wist hoe't it wie
And you did.	En dat dien jo.
Go on! 	Gean troch!
I'm still waiting for your name	Ik wachtsje noch op dyn namme
there is more to tell than you want.	der is mear te fertellen as jo wolle.
I will try to do this at home	Ik sil besykje dit thús te dwaan
I wanted you to get a picture of it	Ik woe dat jo dêr in foto fan krije
So is she.	Sa is se.
I was scared for our lives	Ik wie bang foar ús libben
I do not want.	Ik wol net.
It's not like the city.	It is net as de stêd.
These are not children anymore.	Dit binne gjin bern mear.
I will not leave them.	Ik sil se net litte.
I think it's going well	Ik tink dat it goed komt
So many people needed his help.	Safolle minsken hiene syn help nedich.
Nobody wants you here.	Nimmen wol dy hjir.
I've looked at it in the past	Ik ha der yn it ferline nei sjoen
I also wondered	Ik frege my ek ôf
Get ready for bed.	Meitsje klear foar bêd.
It's clear she's been working.	It is dúdlik dat se wurke hat.
I needed home	Ik wie nedich thús
I have no idea where we are	Ik ha gjin idee wêr't wy binne
They get in trouble.	Se komme yn de problemen.
So, for it.	Sa, foar it.
Now this was twice in one week.	No wie dit twa kear yn ien wike.
She stayed there for many days.	Se bleau dêr in protte dagen.
It was not necessary to do so.	It wie net nedich om it te dwaan.
I did not want to ask him that	Dat woe ik him net freegje
A year ago, her parents	In jier lyn, har âlden
She knew what she was saying.	Se wist wat se die.
I have to go now	Ik moat no fuort
In this life.	Yn dit libben.
Even one hour is good.	Sels ien oere is goed.
It was the best this way.	It wie it bêste op dizze manier.
At one point it came.	Yn ien kear kaam it.
I even wanted to come somehow.	Ik woe sels op ien of oare manier komme.
Please get the book.	Graach it boek krije.
But no one knows where they are.	Mar nimmen wit wêr't se binne.
I did not feel good about it	Ik fielde my dêr net goed by
I thought my family was bad	Ik tocht dat myn famylje min wie
Please wait for me.	Wachtsje asjebleaft op my.
For them to say the word.	Foar har om it wurd te sizzen.
I know what they want	Ik wit wat se wolle
They had no time.	Se hiene gjin tiid hân.
They are here to stay.	Se binne hjir om te bliuwen.
We've talked about it before.	Wy hawwe it der earder oer hân.
I just need the time	Ik haw gewoan de tiid nedich
glad it's not just me.	bliid dat it net allinnich ik.
It really does.	It echt docht.
I do not know the reason either	De reden wit ik ek net
Through the door you told me about.	Troch de doar jo fertelde my oer.
Even the city looks very different.	Sels de stêd sjocht der hiel oars út.
Not one but both.	Net ien mar beide.
I talked to him a bit today	Ik ha hjoed in bytsje mei him praat
He could do nothing to us.	Hy koe ús neat dwaan.
Next thing.	Folgjende ding.
Not that you would.	Net dat jo soene.
It was not what she was talking about.	It wie net wat se praat oer.
I have to believe that	Dat moat ik leauwe
He did not look at me and said nothing.	Hy seach my net oan en sei neat.
It was not real! 	It wie net echt!
he said to himself.	sei er tsjin himsels.
But you did not know.	Mar do wist it net.
I needed him to see the truth and tell it to me.	Ik hie him nedich om de wierheid te sjen en it my te fertellen.
He still had to deal with that.	Dat hie er noch mei te krijen.
I should never have let you go with him.	Ik hie dy noait mei him gean litte moatten.
Along with that, they work on all your problems first.	Tegearre mei it wurkje se earst oan jo alle problemen.
We do not have to worry.	Wy hoege ús gjin soargen te meitsjen.
I wondered if they could see me	Ik frege my ôf oft se my sjen koene
It's not good, it's not bad.	It is net goed, it is net min.
That said, it's getting better.	Dat sei, it wurdt better.
I just left it	Ik liet it gewoan
They've had it for almost a year.	Se hawwe it hast in jier hân.
Like, really, really good.	Like, echt, echt goed.
I hope there will be more.	Ik hoopje dat der mear komme.
He has three.	Hy hat trije.
Let me get this clear.	Lit my dit dúdlik krije.
I had not even asked him	Ik hie him net iens frege
I think it would be better if you stay here	Ik tink dat it better wêze soe as jo hjir bliuwe
Never do that.	Nea dwaan dat.
Now they knew he had told the truth.	No wisten se dat er de wierheid ferteld hie.
I want to be there now	Ik wol der no wêze
It looked just fine.	It like krekt goed.
I'm not quite.	Ik bin net hiel.
That's wrong.	Dat is ferkeard.
I think they still are	Ik tink dat se noch binne
I'll try something different this time	Ik mei dizze kear wat oars besykje
Can't even look at him.	Kin net iens nei him sjen.
Maybe it is, maybe it is not.	Miskien is it, miskien is it net.
Of course not, he never got them.	Fansels net, hy krige se noait.
No one knows by whom.	Nimmen wit troch wa.
I will stay here.	Ik sil hjir bliuwe.
I do not believe a single bit of it.	Ik leau der net ien bytsje fan.
I can not stand it anymore	Ik kin it net mear oan
I ran into two problems	Ik rûn yn twa problemen
I tried not to stay	Ik besocht net te bliuwen
It was not found at the scene.	It waard net fûn op it plak.
I was glad to see that she was careful	Ik wie bliid om te sjen dat se foarsichtich wie
I only saw him, heard only him, felt only him	Ik seach allinnich him, hearde allinnich him, fielde allinnich him
You may be surprised at what else you can find.	Jo kinne ferrast wurde oer wat jo oars kinne fine.
But he is not.	Mar hy is net.
She did not know what to expect.	Se wist net wat se ferwachte hie.
I think he likes her	Ik tink dat er graach har
And everyone just did their job.	En elkenien die gewoan har wurk.
We just need him to make it happen.	Wy hawwe him gewoan nedich om it te meitsjen.
I hope you can help me.	Ik hoopje dat jo my helpe kinne.
I can not go to dinner	Ik kin net nei it iten gean
Anything can happen.	Alles kin barre.
It will not happen again.	It sil net wer barre.
I would show them that.	Ik soe har dat se sjen litte.
I just do not know who.	Ik wit gewoan net wa.
She did not know the name.	Se wist de namme net.
Do not come back here either.	Kom hjir ek net werom.
I know it can be more	Ik wit dat it mear kin
I need to have them.	Ik moat se hawwe.
I'm thinking about it again	Ik tink der wer oer nei
This actually happened to me.	Dizze barde my eins.
You are very good with words.	Do bist hiel goed mei wurden.
He had nothing to say to her.	Hy hie neat te sizzen tsjin har.
See this issue and this.	Sjoch dit probleem en dit.
I would tell you about it if he had	Ik soe jo der oer fertelle as hy hie
He did not look at us.	Hy seach ús net oan.
But it can not.	Mar it kin net.
I could not be with you	Ik koe net by dy wêze
I do not think this was a good idea.	Ik tink net dat dit in goed idee wie.
I wondered what he actually thought	Ik frege my ôf wat er eins tocht
I could not be around anyone	Ik koe net om ien wêze
He was not here when it happened.	Hy wie hjir net doe't it barde.
I still have many friends in this city	Ik haw noch in protte freonen yn dizze stêd
Maybe it's just so different.	Miskien is it gewoan sa oars.
But the parents know that.	Mar de âlden witte dat.
I so wish he was okay	Ik woe sa graach dat er goed wie
I know he will help	Ik wit dat hy wol helpe sil
Come on in if you can.	Kom op as jo kinne.
I tried to prevent it	Ik besocht it foar te kommen
He just came back.	Hy kaam net werom.
They do not want to find it.	Se wolle it net fine.
Or, not what he wanted for his life.	Of, net wat er woe foar syn libben.
You still have them on.	Do hast se noch oan.
It had become so.	It wie sa wurden.
We're going out tonight.	Wy geane fannacht út.
And they would never be the same.	En se soene noait itselde wêze.
I'll be waiting for you there	Ik sil dêr op dy wachtsje
It did not work for me.	It wurke net foar my.
You just ask questions.	Jo freegje gewoan fragen.
The girl looked at my mother and me.	It famke seach myn mem en my oan.
There was obviously not much that this man did not know.	D'r wie fansels net folle dat dizze man net wist.
I can not wait to talk to you	Ik kin net wachtsje om mei dy te praten
I'm going to bed soon	Ik gean gau op bêd
I want to help you through this	Ik wol jo hjir troch helpe
I was not sick one day	Ik wie op in dei net siik
Not so with us.	Net sa by ús.
I was still the same	Ik wie noch altyd itselde
I did not see one or anything	Ik seach net ien of wat
There's a you who wants something.	D'r is in jo dy't wat wol.
That's really it.	Dat is echt it.
I read it well	Ik haw it goed lêzen
I love having these people in my life.	Ik hâld fan dizze minsken yn myn libben te hawwen.
I know they're coming for me	Ik wit dat se foar my komme
I also knew this was not good	Ik wist ek dat dit net goed wie
I would love for them to do it	Ik soe graach wolle dat se it dogge
They to return for of not.	Se om werom foar fan net.
That all happened in just a few months.	Dat barde allegear mar in pear moanne.
I still am.	Ik bin noch altyd.
I think we're too late now	Ik tink dat wy no te let binne
I had absolutely no idea what was going on.	Ik hie hielendal gjin idee wat der oan de hân wie.
I can not believe it otherwise	Ik kin it net oars leauwe
I will not agree with the things he said	Ik sil it net iens wêze mei de dingen dy't hy sei
I could not stay in bed	Ik koe net op bêd bliuwe
I can not go another day without saying it	Ik kin gjin oare dei gean sûnder it te sizzen
That did not happen here.	Dat is hjir net bard.
But not now.	Mar no net.
You live there.	Jo wenje dêr.
I want some time alone with you	Ik wol wat tiid allinnich mei dy
I've never heard of it before this.	Ik haw noch nea heard fan it foar dit.
Everyone wants to be your friend.	Elkenien wol dyn freon wêze.
A city was like that	In stêd wie sa
Where did she go?	Wêr is se hinne gien.
That would be too easy.	Dat soe te maklik wêze.
I really do not want to know.	Ik wol it echt net witte.
I thought of nothing else	Ik tocht oan neat oars
There must be something to give.	Der moat wat jaan.
I felt nothing else	Ik fielde neat oars
But the work is not yet ready.	Mar it wurk is noch net klear.
You were the one who had to find her.	Jo wiene dejinge dy't har fine moast.
We were glad we found this place.	Wy wiene bliid dat wy dit plak fûn hawwe.
I still have some time	Ik haw noch wat tiid
I can not say more about it	Ik kin der net mear oer sizze
I did this two or three times	Ik die dit twa of trije kear
You do not have a bit of.	Jo hawwe net in bytsje fan.
And you can even tell by a lot.	En jo kinne sels sizze troch in protte.
I had to be very clear with her	Ik moast heul dúdlik wêze mei har
He loves me more than his life.	Hy hâldt mear fan my as syn libben.
They do it, and they still do it.	Se dogge it, en se dogge it noch.
It told her he wanted her and he would have her.	It fertelde har dat hy har woe en hy soe har hawwe.
I was worried all the time	Ik makke my de hiele tiid soargen
Not many people can do that.	Net in protte minsken kinne dat dwaan.
We will be happy again.	Wy sille wer bliid wêze.
The other stayed out.	De oare bleau der út.
I wanted to be nice to her	Ik woe moai wêze foar har
It can not really be eaten.	It kin net echt iten wurde.
It's just that we are ours.	It is gewoan dat wy ús binne.
I wish you did not worry.	Ik winskje dat jo gjin soargen meitsje.
The thing to do was just.	It ding om te dwaan wie gewoan.
A life that was his life	In libben dat syn libben wie
I know no one else	Ik ken nimmen mear
I knew they would do well together.	Ik wist dat se it tegearre goed dwaan soene.
I will not be a problem	Ik sil gjin probleem wêze
Come in late, and get out early.	Kom let yn, en gean betiid út.
I did not look very carefully.	Ik seach net hiel foarsichtich.
Let me help you now.	Lit my jo no helpe.
So, he does not know exactly how it happened.	Sa, hy wit net krekt hoe't it barde.
You have to be here.	Jo moatte hjir wêze.
I want you to be with me	Ik wol dat jo by my binne
He said he did not want one.	Hy sei dat er net ien woe.
I wanted to say something, everything	Ik woe wat sizze, alles
They will say what they want.	Se sille sizze wat se wolle.
It was easy to make.	It wie maklik om te meitsjen.
I just did not know how to tell you	Ik wist gewoan net hoe't ik dy fertelle moast
You had a lot of people worried.	Jo hiene in protte minsken soargen.
I had to find you again	Ik moast dy wer fine
He made us his children.	Hy hat ús syn bern makke.
I was afraid that everyone would hurt me	Ik wie bang dat elkenien my sear dwaan woe
That was what she should have done.	Dat hie se dwaan moatten.
Everyone saw it.	Elkenien seach it.
You can have one without the other.	Jo kinne ien hawwe sûnder de oare.
Though you're probably still a good few years from now.	Al binne jo wierskynlik noch in pear jier goed.
It was not so.	It wie net sa.
So he got a little angry.	Sa waard er wat lilk.
It's different for everyone.	It is foar elkenien oars.
No questions from the woman.	Gjin fragen fan de frou.
I guess it's not really hit me yet	Ik tink dat it my noch net echt rekke is
I had never had this chance before	Ik hie dizze kâns noch noait earder
I'll tell you something.	Ik sil dy wat fertelle.
I was not allowed to see him	Ik mocht him net sjen
Things that just work.	Dingen dy't gewoan wurkje.
No one knew that better than he did.	Nimmen wist dat better as hy.
I think she was too scared	Ik tink dat se te bang wie
I was trying to hurt you	Ik besocht dy sear te meitsjen
I would never know what he wanted	Ik soe nea witte wat er woe
I asked why.	Ik frege wêrom.
They are busy.	Se binne drok.
If it were not, they would stop.	As it net wie, soene se ophâlde.
Children come out.	Bern komme út.
I can not say good enough about it.	Ik kin der net genôch goed oer sizze.
There was something different this time too.	Der wie dizze kear ek wat oars.
Then they become happy.	Dan wurde se bliid.
He probably would.	Hy soe wierskynlik.
They let the old man worry.	Se litte de âld man de soargen dwaan.
There is nothing like that.	Der is neat as dat.
She did not want to hurt him.	Se woe him net sear dwaan.
And then they have everything they want.	En dan hawwe se alles wat se wolle.
I want to be very clear, here.	Ik wol hiel dúdlik wêze, hjir.
I need to talk to you	Ik moat mei dy prate
We can do nothing tonight.	Wy kinne fannacht neat dwaan.
I tried to tell her that.	Ik besocht har dat te fertellen.
I can stay as long as they need me to stay.	Ik kin bliuwe sa lang as se nedich hawwe my te bliuwen.
But he does no more.	Mar hy docht net mear.
They want it bad.	Se wolle it min.
We're glad you're here.	Wy binne bliid dat jo hjir binne.
I got a job.	Ik krige in baan.
They had no one else.	Se hiene gjinien oars.
It's time for me to go back.	It is tiid foar my om werom te gean.
I always hoped it would never happen that way	Ik hie altyd hope dat it noait sa komme soe
Which surprises me about you.	Wat my ferrast oer dy.
I told you to be careful	Ik sei dy om foarsichtich te wêzen
You think of a better place to talk, okay.	Jo tinke oan in better plak om te praten, goed.
I need him now.	Ik haw him no nedich.
You will do nothing.	Jo sille neat dwaan.
You will not have both.	Jo sille gjin beide hawwe.
I'll be playing in about an hour	Ik spylje oer in oere
I would like you to give me a chance	Ik soe graach wolle dat jo my in kâns jaan
I do not see who started it.	Ik sjoch net wa't it begûn.
I'll do this when you're next time.	Ik sil dit dwaan as jo de folgjende kear binne.
Mom is back and sitting there already.	Mem is werom en sit der al.
That he needed.	Dat hie er nedich.
I need to take care of some things	Ik moat wat dingen soargje
I want the girl alive	Ik wol it famke yn libben
I knew those things about her	Ik wist dy dingen oer har
Just look at his place.	Sjoch mar op syn plak.
She never wants to talk to me again.	Se wol noait wer mei my prate.
They were tired.	Se wiene wurch.
I was even expected to do that	Ik waard sels ferwachte dat te dwaan
I hope to see you there	Ik hoopje dy dêr te sjen
We still have some time.	Wy hawwe noch wat tiid.
This time you will.	Dizze kear sille jo.
I'm glad I'm back to work.	Ik bin bliid dat ik wer oan it wurk bin.
He tried not to come.	Hy besocht net te kommen.
I was not the only one	Ik wie net de ienige
He's sure.	Hy is wis.
You are here for one reason, and only one reason.	Jo binne hjir foar ien reden, en mar ien reden.
There is something for everyone.	Der is wat foar elkenien.
I think that's pretty good	Ik tink dat is moai goed
Things are going around us.	Dingen geane om ús hinne.
I can almost see it	Dy kin ik hast sjen
That you do not have to do to me.	Dat jo hoege jo net om my te dwaan.
I believe .	Ik leau .
She would not say.	Se soe net sizze.
I never thought of it that way	Ik tocht der noait sa oan
I hope it is not too much	Ik hoopje dat it net te folle is
There is no reason to give up.	Der is gjin reden om op te jaan.
You will regret it.	Jo sille it spyt hawwe.
People need to wake up.	Minsken moatte wekker wurde.
I love her very much.	Ik hâld tige fan har.
I can not tell you here	Ik kin it dy hjir net fertelle
We'll see if they get it or not.	Wy sille sjen oft se it krije of net.
He had done it before.	Hy hie it earder dien.
I had no time	Ik hie gjin tiid
I looked at my mother	Ik seach nei myn mem
You have to.	Jo moatte.
And do not even think about opening that door.	En tink net iens om dy doar iepen te dwaan.
I still need some of you	Ik ha noch wat fan dy nedich
I can do it easily for you	Ik kin it maklik foar jo dwaan
Maybe that's it.	Miskien is dat it.
And he liked her very much.	En hy mocht tige fan har.
That's your way.	Dat is dyn wei.
That's everyone then, is it.	Dat is dan elkenien, is it.
He had to try.	Hy moast besykje.
Now everything can be said about you and done to you.	No kin alles oer dy sein en oan dy dien wurde.
I could not stay angry at her	Ik koe net lilk op har bliuwe
I think your office can have it	Ik tink dat jo kantoar it kin hawwe
What is the best way to do it ?.	Wat is de bêste manier om it te dwaan?.
I will take care of you too.	Ik sil ek foar dy soargje.
Being a mother was hard enough.	Mem wêze wie dreech genôch.
I know what she can do	Ik wit wat se dwaan kin
I did not look at his hand.	Ik wist net nei syn hân te sjen.
She wondered what he knew of what was happening.	Se frege har ôf wat er wist fan wat der barde.
That was the problem.	Dat wie it probleem.
I had to look around me first	Ik moast earst om my hinne sjen
He did not try.	Hy besocht it net.
I did not think you knew no words with more than two.	Ik tocht net dat jo gjin wurden wisten mei mear as twa.
Even if we do not win, we will be happy.	Sels as wy net winne, sille wy bliid wêze.
One before, and one after	In foar, en in nei
It was just too much.	It wie gewoan te folle.
Well, maybe not so easy, though.	No, miskien net sa maklik, mar.
I have not been there for a few years	Ik haw der in pear jier net west
In fact, you can.	Eins kinne jo.
Maybe a week.	Miskien in wike.
So you have not heard of them.	Sa ha jo net fan har heard.
Must be real.	Moat echt wêze.
It's the only way.	It is de ienige manier.
I had not seen them in a few years	Ik hie se in pear jier net sjoen
A few hours ago.	In pear oeren lyn.
We have not given it to him in a week.	Wy hawwe it him al in wike net jûn.
It was not one's home.	It wie net ien syn thús.
I really thought she would stay	Ik tocht echt dat se soe bliuwe
People put it there for a reason.	Minsken sette it dêr foar in reden.
And that is very different.	En dat is hiel oars.
She's the best thing that ever happened to me.	Se is it bêste ding dat foar my bard is.
I had other things to do, and would not go	Ik hie oare dingen te dwaan, en soe net gean
Not with him.	Net mei him.
I was no different	Ik wie net oars
And from now on, this may be the first photo.	En fan no ôf kin dit de earste foto wêze.
This time it worked.	Dizze kear wurke it.
But otherwise it was only with two.	Mar oars wiene it mar mei twa.
We need something else.	Wy moatte wat oars.
But we'll see.	Mar wy sille sjen.
As we.	As wy.
I ran out of time	Ik rûn út tiid
She was there just for me.	Se wie der allinnich foar my.
I'm doing something for him, maybe	Ik doch wat foar him, miskien
It's what everyone would do.	It is wat elkenien soe dwaan.
Good and bad.	Goed en min.
If so, no problem here.	As it noch sa is, gjin probleem hjir.
I know what's good for me	Ik wit wat goed foar my is
But my name was not me.	Mar myn namme wie ik net.
I did not find it to be a problem.	Ik haw net fûn dat it in probleem is.
And that was not the problem.	En dat wie net it probleem.
Carefully she opened it.	Foarsichtich die se it iepen.
I'm glad I'm going back to work	Ik bin bliid dat ik wer oan it wurk gean
So that works then.	Sa wurket dat dan.
I was surprised he did not already know	Ik wie ferrast dat hy it net al wist
I never knew them either.	Ik koe se ek noait.
We are just people.	Wy binne gewoan minsken.
I'll tell her.	Ik sil it har fertelle.
I also said the same thing to her	Ik sei ek itselde tsjin har
I'm working on it.	Ik wurkje der oan.
I was always waiting for her	Ik wachte altyd op har
Let me know if you have any questions.	Lit my witte as jo fragen hawwe.
And then let it go.	En lit it dan gean.
I know the reason for your question	Ik wit de reden foar jo fraach
We are not sure which.	Wy binne net wis hokker.
Please do not be afraid of us.	Wês asjebleaft net bang foar ús.
Nobody knows what.	Nimmen wit wat.
You just said the words.	Jo hawwe krekt sein de wurden.
I know him well.	Ik ken him goed.
I need to know what they want with me	Ik moat witte wat se mei my wolle
I've heard of you.	Ik haw fan dy heard.
But not from my family.	Mar net fan myn famylje.
My plan was good.	Myn plan wie goed.
He left after a month	Hy gie nei in moanne fuort
And this was not the first time.	En dit wie net de earste kear.
And there's one more thing.	En der is noch ien ding.
I know how they are	Ik wit hoe't se binne
I'm sure kids will enjoy it.	Ik bin der wis fan dat bern har leuk fine.
A young man arrived	In jonge man kaam oan
We had given three hours of school last night.	Wy hiene jûn trije oeren skoalle.
I already ate food	Ik iet al iten
That's what we were talking about.	Dêr hiene wy ​​it oer hân.
It showed how things actually were that day.	It liet sjen hoe't dingen dy dei eins wiene.
Not to this day.	Net oant dizze dei.
I did not know they were friends	Ik wist net dat se freonen wiene
All they did was do their job.	Alles wat se diene wie har wurk.
I can not talk about it now	Ik kin der no net oer prate
That, of course, is simply not true.	Dat is fansels gewoan net wier.
He just did not let us do it.	Hy liet it ús gewoan net dwaan.
I sat and waited.	Ik siet en wachte.
I have heard nothing since	Ik haw sûnt neat heard
I found water.	Ik fûn wetter.
But she should know better.	Mar se soe better witte moatte.
He started around her.	Hy begûn om har hinne.
Quite something else.	Hielendal wat oars.
He had done many things in his life.	Hy hie in protte dingen dien yn syn libben.
Do not do it, girl.	Doch it net, famke.
Of course you did.	Fansels hawwe jo dien.
I look surprised, and a little scared	Ik sjoch ferrast, en in bytsje bang
You're doing what you have to do with me.	Jo dogge wat jo moatte mei my.
I gave nothing	Ik joech neat
That he can try.	Dat kin hy besykje.
I know now that he wants this for me	Ik wit no dat hy dit foar my wol wolle
I knew it had to be a reason	Ik wist dat it in reden wêze moast
I assume that is gone	Ik nim oan dat dat fuort is
I just want things to be different	Ik wol gewoan dat dingen oars binne
The same could be said of me.	Itselde koe fan my sein wurde.
I think you have a good thing here	Ik tink dat jo hjir in goed ding hawwe
So we love him.	Sa hâlde wy fan him.
I was not allowed to get sick	Ik mocht net siik wurde
I'm so sorry.	It spyt my gewoan sa heul.
This is different.	Dit is oars.
I never thought about what that person would ask	Ik haw noait tocht oer wat dy persoan freegje soe
Glad to see it.	Graach om it te sjen.
I probably will not even need you	Ik sil dy wierskynlik net iens nedich hawwe
My life was here.	Myn libben wie hjir.
I still had work to do	Ik hie noch wurk te dwaan
No one else knew it.	Nimmen oars wist it.
I knew you were not here long	Ik wist dat jo hjir net lang wiene
I wonder why she knows these things	Ik freegje my ôf wêrom't se dizze dingen wit
It was a week of work or more.	It wie in wike wurk of mear.
I know she knows what's going on	Ik wit dat se wit wat der bart
I was not afraid of him	Ik wie net bang foar him
But you never know what will happen.	Mar jo witte noait wat der barre sil.
He can not find her.	Hy kin har net fine.
I'm there soon.	Ik bin der no gau.
I could not see my life without her.	Ik koe myn libben sûnder har net sjen.
I did nothing wrong, here	Ik haw neat ferkeard dien, hjir
Was what happened.	Wie wat der bard.
Take the money.	Nim it jild.
I did not expect anything from this movie before I saw it	Ik hie neat fan dizze film ferwachte foardat ik seach
I had to go back to you	Ik moast werom nei dy
He had the chance.	Hy hie de kâns.
I have decided.	Ik haw my besletten.
Never be a boy or girl	In jonge of famke nea te wêzen
To become what they want me to be.	Om te wurden wat se wolle dat ik bin.
I just stared at her	Ik liet my allinnich nei har sjen
I could not find him, he could not find me	Ik koe him net fine, hy koe my net fine
I remember how old she would be.	Ik tink oan hoe âld se wêze soe.
Even without me on it.	Ek sûnder my derop.
Take to my father.	Nim nei myn heit.
I have tried to keep up.	Ik haw besocht te hâlden.
I know this first hand	Ik wit dit earste hân
It could not be easy for her, but she tried.	It koe net maklik foar har, mar se besocht.
Let me know if you are interested.	Lit my witte as jo ynteressearre binne.
Does as read.	Doet as te lêzen.
I did not want to go to school	Ik woe net op skoalle
He told me what he needed.	Hy fertelde my wat hy nedich wie.
I would also like to talk to her.	Ik soe ek graach mei har prate wolle.
But it became what it was.	Mar it waard wat it wie.
I think we should stay here	Ik tink dat wy hjir bliuwe moatte
We do not have much in the house.	Wy hawwe net safolle yn 'e hûs.
The boy was not afraid of me.	De jonge wie net bang foar my.
I have not seen him since	Ik haw him sûnt net sjoen
The person is looking at you.	De persoan sjocht nei dy.
That may be what you want.	Dat kin wêze wat jo wolle.
I've never seen it either	Ik haw it ek nea sjoen
It's one of those things that makes it hard to make work.	It is ien fan dy dingen dy't dreech te meitsjen wurk.
This is ready now.	Dit is no klear.
I had liked her before	Ik hie har earder leuk fûn
It was not an animal.	It wie gjin bist.
The people around him are first class	De minsken om him hinne binne earste klasse
If it works.	As it wurket.
That should not have been the case.	Dat hie net sa wêze moatten.
Let's see if we can keep him there.	Litte wy sjen oft wy him dêr hâlde kinne.
I was really looking forward to it	Ik seach der echt nei út
Those things can be true.	Dy dingen kinne wier wêze.
He was his time.	Hy wie syn tiid.
I know exactly what happened	Ik wit krekt wat der bard is
It did nothing for me.	It die neat foar my.
I had an idea what was going on.	Ik hie in idee wat der oan de hân wie.
I always did the right thing	Ik die altyd it goede ding
So and life and for three years.	Sa en it libben en foar trije jier.
That could go on.	Dat koe wol troch.
I will stay here with her	Ik sil hjir by har bliuwe
Or as good as he ever will.	Of sa goed as hy oait sil.
A few questions.	In pear fragen.
I'm sick of this.	Ik bin siik fan dit.
I'll be back soon	Ik kom gau werom
I need to find someone	Ik moat immen fine
Will you try it ?.	Sille jo it besykje?.
Not everyone can do that.	Net elkenien kin dat dwaan.
He wanted to do something.	Hy woe wat dwaan.
So, so much.	Sa, safolle.
So it seems like it's good.	Sa liket it derop dat it goed is.
I know you know what it's like	Ik wit dat jo witte hoe't it is
The day is coming.	De dei komt oan.
It's that and more.	It is dat en mear.
It seems so clear now.	It liket no sa dúdlik.
I do not think it does	Ik tink net dat it docht
It did not do too well.	It die net al te goed.
I do not know, man.	Ik wit it net, man.
I can show it to you if you want	Ik kin it jo sjen litte as jo wolle
It for everyone? 	It foar elkenien?
She did not know it but hope.	Se wist it net mar hope.
don't worry.	meitsje dy gjin soargen.
I know him and his work better than anyone	Ik ken him en syn wurk better as elkenien
He was another dog there.	Hy wie dêr in oare hûn.
These problems will come and go.	Dizze problemen sille komme en gean.
It's nothing to me in any way.	It is my neat op ien of oare manier.
I had never touched anyone in my life	Ik hie noch noait ien yn myn libben rekke
She was in trouble.	Se wie yn de problemen.
I know how hard you work	Ik wit hoe hurd jo wurkje
It comes on its own.	It komt op himsels.
They know who they are.	Se witte wa't se binne.
And she will help you.	En se sil jo helpe.
I know what she's thinking.	Ik wit wat se tinkt.
Did not work often.	Hat net faak wurke.
I guess she must have found something to the place	Ik nim oan dat se wol wat oan it plak fûn hawwe moat
Let's get out of here.	Lit ús hjir wei gean.
It's very good of you.	It is hiel goed fan dy.
I had found my chance and took it	Ik hie myn kâns fûn en naam it
I first heard what she was saying	Ik hearde earst wat se sei
I really want to get this photo thing over	Ik wol echt dit foto ding oer krije
That would have been a long time ago.	Dat soe al lang lyn west hawwe.
I did not ask where she was going	Ik frege net wêr't se hinne soe
He said he just could not.	Hy sei dat er it gewoan net koe.
I want them back.	Ik wol se werom.
Sit and talk to her.	Sit en praat mei har.
I wondered who he could be	Ik frege my ôf wa't er wêze koe
I think he's fine.	Ik tink dat hy goed is.
The door of the office opened.	De doar fan it kantoar gie iepen.
Not going yet.	Noch net gean.
I think our kids like us	Ik tink dat ús bern ús leuk fine
There are some issues.	Der binne wat problemen.
I knew what he could do	Ik wist wat er dwaan koe
Not everyone likes it.	Net elkenien liket it.
He said.	Hy sei.
It just could not.	It koe gewoan net.
She's not coming.	Se komt net.
It was not good.	It wie net goed.
I need to talk to her	Ik moat mei har prate
We probably do.	Dat dogge wy wierskynlik.
Now, come out and make something.	No, kom út en meitsje wat.
I did the work myself	Ik die it wurk sels
You have good thoughts as you go.	Jo hawwe goede gedachten as jo gean.
i do not know what to do	ik wit net wat ik dwaan moat
He will be there.	Hy sil der wêze.
I wondered where it came from	Ik frege my ôf wêr't it kaam
You would think there would be more.	Jo soene tinke dat der mear wêze soe.
I know you will think of me	Ik wit dat jo oan my tinke sille
I know one of the people who work there	Ik ken ien fan de minsken dy't dêr wurkje
She holds his hand.	Se hâldt syn hân.
But nothing comes of it.	Mar der komt neat.
They know where you are.	Se witte wêr't jo binne.
And let your kids eat them.	En lit jo bern se ite.
There was the problem.	Dêr wie it probleem.
I could not hope for a better teacher	Ik koe net hoopje op in bettere learaar
I think you're well aware of what's next.	Ik tink dat jo goed witte wat it folgjende is.
Make him afraid of us, and he will let us go.	Meitsje him bang foar ús, en hy lit ús gean.
She would know what to do.	Se soe witte wat te dwaan.
It does not matter to him whether you agree with him or not.	It makket him neat út oft jo it mei him iens binne of net.
I also know about your father	Ik wit ek fan dyn heit
I was just wondering, that's all	Ik frege my gewoan ôf, dat is alles
Go through the door.	Gean troch de doar.
I could not even go to school	Ik koe net iens nei skoalle gean
I do not know how to help her.	Ik wit net hoe ik har helpe moat.
I have no idea why they do that.	Ik haw gjin idee wêrom't se dat dogge.
I touched it with my hand.	Ik rekke it mei myn hân oan.
I could not get away from him	Ik koe net fan him ôf
I just want to know what happened to him	Ik wol gewoan witte wat der mei him bard is
I'm a very very bad person.	Ik bin in hiel hiel min persoan.
There's a lot in it.	Der sit in protte yn.
But that's how it is.	Mar dat is hoe't it is.
So are we.	Sa binne wy.
I will not do it again	Ik sil it net mear dwaan
I had not seen them for over a week	Ik hie se al mear as in wike net sjoen
And maybe want to be happy to see her.	En miskien wol bliid om har te sjen.
That seems to be here.	Dat liket hjir te wêzen.
Everyone will know everything about everyone.	Elkenien sil alles witte oer elkenien.
I hope it works for you!	Ik hoopje dat it foar jo wurket!
I wondered if life would ever be the same again	Ik frege my ôf oft it libben oait wer itselde wêze soe
The question was what to do with it.	De fraach wie wat der mei te dwaan.
I think two out of three were not bad	Ik tink dat twa fan trije net min wiene
It can be such a thing as having better time.	It kin sa'n ding wêze as bettere tiid hawwe.
We will not have them next year.	Dy ha wy takom jier net.
I did not have a job yet	Ik hie noch gjin baan
But with everything else, we might not need him.	Mar mei al it oare hawwe wy him miskien net nedich.
I've been to your mother's all morning.	Ik ha de hiele moarn by dyn mem west.
A man, so much was certain	In man, safolle wie wis
That guy is really the best.	Dy man is echt de bêste.
It must be.	It moat wêze.
It was really nice to see them again.	It wie echt moai om se wer te sjen.
It never works.	It wurket noait.
Did not like it.	Hie dit net leuk.
I believe it is not.	Ik leau dat it net is.
I can see that, anyone can	Dat kin ik sjen, elkenien kin
You are my everything.	Do bist myn alles.
I saw it was an old man	Ik seach dat it in âld man wie
No one worked as hard as he did.	Nimmen wurke sa hurd as hy.
Her father.	Har heit.
They have no children.	Se hawwe gjin bern.
It came back to me.	It kaam by my werom.
Not decided yet.	Noch net besletten.
We will be working hard this week to be ready for that.	Wy sille dizze wike hurd wurkje om dêr klear foar te wêzen.
They can not.	Se kinne net.
It is likely that he lived with his parents	It is wierskynlik dat hy by syn âlden wenne
We will need it.	Wy sille it nedich hawwe.
This means they can get better.	Dit wol sizze, se kinne better wurde.
She happened to me.	Se barde my.
He had work to do.	Hy hat wurk hân.
But he had done none of this.	Mar hy hie neat fan dizze dien.
I just did not know for what reason	Ik wist gewoan net om hokker reden
I'm just glad I heard from you.	Ik bin gewoan bliid dat ik fan dy heard ha.
I stayed in the room looking towards the door	Ik bleau yn 'e keamer nei de doar te sjen
I am sorry.	It spyt my.
I love big last week	Ik hâld fan grutte lêste wike
I wanted him back in my bed	Ik woe him werom yn myn bêd
I could stay or return	Ik koe bliuwe of werom
Now that's me.	No dat bin ik.
He was out with his wife.	Hy wie út mei syn frou.
I also have another question	Ik haw ek in oare fraach
I wonder what he has to offer	Ik freegje my ôf wat er te krijen hat
There will be more.	Der sille mear wêze.
I did not want to be that man	Ik woe dy man net wêze
It was his first major work	It wie syn earste grutte wurk
I did not know they were needed.	Ik wist net dat se nedich wiene.
We had it last week.	Wy hiene it ferline wike.
It's not what you think it is.	It is net wat jo tinke dat it is.
No way to come back.	Gjin manier om werom te kommen.
I was sure no one knew much about him	Ik wie der wis fan dat gjinien in protte oer him wist
It felt so good.	It fielde sa goed.
I think she wants to know what she's doing	Ik tink dat se wol wit wat se docht
I was next.	Ik wie folgjende.
I had heard from him, he had heard from me.	Ik hie fan him heard, hy hie fan my heard.
I did not run out this time	Ik rûn dizze kear net út
I saw him just a week ago	Ik seach him krekt in wike lyn
Or maybe there was more to it than that.	Of miskien wie der mear oan as dat.
What it could and what it could not.	Wat it koe en wat it net koe.
I could not believe it	Dat koe ik net leauwe
Talk to those around you to find out the truth.	Praat mei dy om dy hinne om de wierheid út te finen.
Of course he could not see it.	Fansels koe er it net sjen.
There was work involved.	Der siet wurk by.
I think we found our husband	Ik tink dat wy ús man fûn hawwe
I'm not telling you what to do.	Ik fertel dy net wat te dwaan.
A little more.	In bytsje mear.
That's the whole problem.	Dat is it hiele probleem.
I think this is the right way to go.	Ik tink dat dit de goede manier is om te gean.
I've been waiting for an hour	Ik wachte al in oere
I agreed not to tell anyone about it	Ik wie it iens om der net ien oer te fertellen
You are just in time.	Jo binne krekt op 'e tiid.
She was scared.	Se wie bang.
It's about your father.	It giet oer dyn heit.
This is just him.	Dit is hy net.
I knew he would not give him anything	Ik wist dat er him neat jaan soe
But it was nice when he was out of the room.	Mar it wie moai doe't er de keamer út wie.
I did not even know the truth	Ik wist net iens de wierheid
It was not much more than that.	It wie net folle mear as dat.
I was not in that meeting.	Ik wie net yn dy gearkomste.
It is much the same with us today.	It is hjoed by ús in protte itselde.
I just tried to be good to her	Ik besocht allinnich goed foar har te wêzen
I could help you do it if you want	Ik koe jo helpe om it te dwaan as jo wolle
I hope he would not do that	Ik hope dat er dat net dwaan soe
I'm a little worried	Ik bin in bytsje soargen
It was another man.	It wie in oare man.
It can help.	It kin helpe.
Do not worry about him.	Sit gjin soargen oer him.
I would say in three years	Ik soe sizze oer trije jier
I only needed two more	Ik hie mar twa mear nedich
Look at it, it's hard to do.	Sjoch it op, it is dreech om te dwaan.
They do many things wrong.	Se dogge in protte dingen ferkeard.
I can do better than that	Ik kin better as dat
Let them know.	Lit se witte.
I should not have done that	Dat hie ik net dwaan moatten
I'll let him know.	Ik sil him witte litte.
I wonder why he was here	Ik freegje my ôf wêrom't er hjir wie
He will make things happen.	Hy sil dingen barre.
I should have looked at the time.	Ik hie nei de tiid sjen moatten.
I was three hours early	Ik wie trije oeren betiid
Where is home then ?.	Wêr is dan thús?.
He could not see one thing or another.	Hy koe gjin ien of ding sjen.
I have to get back to work.	Ik moat wer oan it wurk.
I never asked where	Ik haw noait frege wêr
I guess she came up with it.	Ik nim oan dat se der op ôf kaam.
I can be none of this	Ik kin hjir neat fan wêze
Life shows you who you have become.	It libben lit jo sjen wa't jo wurden binne.
I knew what this was really about	Ik wist wêr't dit echt oer gie
The girl did not want to talk.	It famke woe net prate.
Maybe he never goes out.	Miskien giet er noait út.
I'm really happy.	Ik bin echt bliid.
I know you all have questions	Ik wit dat jo allegear fragen hawwe
I could let him go.	Ik koe him gean litte.
Boy, were we surprised.	Jonge, wiene wy ​​ferrast.
It makes him late for school and me too late for work.	It makket him te let op skoalle en my te let op it wurk.
That's the truth.	Dat is de wierheid.
I would love to talk to you if you have time.	Ik soe graach mei jo prate as jo tiid hawwe.
I see a girl in front of me	Ik sjoch in famke foar my
He would have to do so much.	Hy soe safolle dwaan moatte.
Nobody likes that.	Nimmen hâldt dat.
Look at the man.	Sjoch de man.
One person was killed	Ien persoan kaam om it libben
That's enough for now.	Dat is foar no wol genôch.
Try just a little.	Besykje mar in bytsje.
It was everything she expected.	It wie alles wat se ferwachte.
And your mother.	En dyn mem.
Well, that would do it.	No, dat soe it dwaan.
You just have to have faith.	Jo moatte gewoan leauwe hawwe.
They just want things to work out.	Se wolle gewoan dat dingen wurkje.
Been good for so long.	Al sa lang goed west.
I really did not want to go	Ik woe echt net gean
I really think she's sorry	Ik tink echt dat se it spyt hat
She's old, for one.	Se is âld, foar ien.
I need you to help me find work	Ik haw jo nedich om my te helpen wurk te finen
He only expected to be away for a few days.	Hy ferwachte mar in pear dagen fuort te wêzen.
She needed to talk to someone.	Se moast mei immen prate.
I just had to do it to see	Ik moast it gewoan dwaan om te sjen
I see that.	Ik sjoch dat.
I would not ask if there was another way	Ik soe net freegje, as der in oare manier wie
I was the first.	Ik wie de earste.
I never wanted it to stop	Ik woe noait dat it ophâlde
I should not be here at all, really	Ik soe hjir hielendal net wêze moatte, echt
See you this weekend.	Oant sjen dit wykein.
I'm not angry at you.	Ik bin net lilk op dy.
It's such a life now.	It is no sa'n libben.
I did not even know what was wrong with him	Ik wist net iens wat der mei him wie
I just could not let him	Ik koe him gewoan net litte
If you had, you would not be here.	As jo ​​hiene, soene jo hjir net wêze.
Everything the man said was true.	Alles wat de man sei wie wier.
Which we know about.	Dy't wy witte oer.
That's what it's about.	Dat is wat it giet.
I should have done absolutely nothing	Ik hie hielendal neat dwaan moatten
I think you might like it	Ik tink dat jo it miskien leuk fine
Behold, my name is.	Sjoch, myn namme is.
Think about what you want to do.	Tink oer wat jo wolle dwaan.
That's what they say has happened.	Dat is wat se sizze dat der bard is.
Everything they like.	Alles wat se leuk fine.
I walked out of her office and never came back	Ik rûn har kantoar út en kaam noait werom
I did not know of anything	Ik wist net fan wat
But he had it in him.	Mar hy hie it yn him.
I did not see you there	Ik seach dy dêr net
It did not have to be.	It hoegde net te wêzen.
I really, really.	Ik echt, echt.
I have to keep them alive	Ik moat se yn libben hâlde
He felt sick.	Hy fielde him siik.
Of course it can.	Fansels kin it.
I will never let that happen	Ik sil dat noait barre litte
And then just do so much again.	En dan mar wer safolle te dwaan.
I did not ask to come here	Ik haw net frege om hjir te kommen
Everyone was here.	Elkenien wie hjir.
You are my husband or my father.	Do bist myn man noch myn heit.
If you stay there, so will you !!!!!!.	As jo ​​der by bliuwe, dan sille jo ek!!!!!!.
It's never pretty.	It is noait moai.
I just hope it does not work out	Ik hoopje mar dat it net giet
I want him out of our lives	Ik wol him út ús libben
They do something with you that you never expected.	Se dogge wat mei jo dat jo noait ferwachte hawwe.
I felt whole again.	Ik fielde my wer hiel.
I got into hair.	Ik bin yn hier kommen.
I did not tell her, but it was	Ik haw it har net ferteld, mar it wie
To read me.	Om my te lêzen.
He had never seen it like this.	Hy hie it noait sa sjoen.
I thought you were.	Ik tocht dat jo wiene.
I've never made it myself	Ik haw it sels noait makke
And there is a question.	En der is in fraach.
They're coming out in a few weeks.	Se komme oer in pear wike út.
I wanted to stay with him	Ik woe him bliuwe
I could not hold it long	Ik koe it net lang hâlde
She told it like it was.	Se fertelde it as it wie.
I could not do that to her	Dat koe ik har net dwaan
I could not find much about it.	Ik koe der net folle oer fine.
I would of course like to know why.	Ik soe fansels graach witte wêrom.
It was just not done.	It wie gewoan net dien.
I was not ready to give up on her	Ik wie net ree om har op te jaan
Then he does nothing.	Dan docht er neat.
No problem so far.	Gjin probleem oant no ta.
I do not need the money.	Ik haw it jild net nedich.
I wanted to be wrong	Ik woe ferkeard wêze
When he speaks he always speaks like that.	As er praat praat er altyd sa.
It is clear that it is a few years ago.	It is dúdlik dat it in pear jier lyn is.
I'm sorry to do that.	It spyt my om it te dwaan.
They did not.	Dy hiene net.
I did it pretty well there	Ik ha it der aardich goed dien
Money, money, money.	Jild, jild, jild.
I'm thinking of doing a job now	Ik tink der no oan om in baan te dwaan
Try it for yourself.	Besykje it sels.
We've been here long enough.	Wy binne hjir lang genôch west.
It's the best thing that ever happened to him.	It is it bêste dat him oait bard is.
And you did not.	En do hast net.
He knows it.	Hy wit dit.
I'll keep them away.	Ik sil se fuort hâlde.
He did it very, very well.	Hy die it hiel, hiel goed.
It will not be the last.	It sil net de lêste wêze.
I knew you were good	Ik wist dat jo goed wiene
But they could not do much about it.	Mar dêr koene se net folle oan dwaan.
But do not let me.	Mar lit my net litte.
I did not even have a job	Ik hie net iens wurk
You are something very different.	Jo binne wat hiel oars.
My husband first.	Myn man earst.
And that is.	En dat is.
And maybe she was.	En miskien wie se.
I really had.	Ik hie echt.
He would see her again one day.	Hy soe har op in dei wer sjen.
I was just thinking of something else	Ik tocht krekt oan wat oars
We never put it on.	Wy sette it noait op.
I came back to talk to her about it	Ik kaam werom om dêr mei har oer te praten
I looked around the room	Ik seach om 'e keamer
But the demand for the same remained.	Mar de fraach nei itselde bleau.
Not yet, he thought.	Noch net, tocht er.
As if it did not affect him.	As rekke it him net.
They had done that before.	Dat hiene se earder dien.
He has to go.	Hy moat gean.
That does come with time.	Dat komt wol mei de tiid.
Maybe she could.	Miskien koe se.
You and me.	Do en ik.
In a way, he's really there.	Op in manier is hy der echt.
Who wanted a child.	Wa woe in bern.
And now the everything.	En no die alles.
They could do that here too.	Dat koene se hjir ek dwaan.
I thought of his wife	Ik tocht oan syn frou
I was not happy about this.	Ik wie net bliid oer dit.
Everything will be fine.	Alles sil goed wêze.
She needs to go home now.	Se moat no nei hûs.
I love being seen and thinking you were the same	Ik hâld fan sjoen wurde en tocht dat jo itselde wiene
I have no idea where	Ik haw gjin idee wêr
And we hope for the best.	En wy hoopje op it bêste.
I did not think it would be, but it really is	Ik tocht net dat it soe wêze, mar it is echt
'I !.	'ik!.
You have a way with him.	Jo hawwe in manier mei him.
The whole book.	It hiele boek.
The dog, of course.	De hûn, fansels.
I was worried about him	Ik wie soargen oer him
Much like him.	In protte as hy.
I wondered who I would be	Ik frege my ôf wa't ik wêze soe
The next day.	De folgjende dei.
Go to your bed.	Gean nei dyn bêd.
I should not have seen	Ik hie net sjen moatten
I have more to tell you	Ik haw jo mear te fertellen
I also never wanted to hurt him	Ik woe him ek noait sear dwaan
I handed them over to the police	Ik joech se oan de plysje
We may not know it, but we are.	Wy kinne it net witte, mar wy binne.
I talk to him every day.	Ik praat alle dagen mei him.
I think he needs some time	Ik tink dat hy wat tiid nedich hat
But we have a job to do.	Mar wy hawwe in wurk te dwaan.
I assume that has happened now.	Ik nim oan dat dat no bard is.
Want to know what you're doing.	Wolle jo witte wat jo dogge.
Yours are so beautiful.	Dyn binne sa moai.
He showed us and it really did.	Hy liet ús sjen en it die echt.
This way, this way.	Dizze manier, dizze manier.
There was no place left for him.	Dêr wie gjin plak mear foar him.
Maybe he's not talking at all.	Miskien prate er hielendal net.
I bought a whole year	Ik kocht in hiel jier
It had to be that way.	It moast sa wêze.
She liked him too much to talk to him.	Se mocht him te folle om mei him te praten.
I was not sure it was true	Ik wie der net wis fan dat it wier wie
I knew exactly what was going to happen	Ik wist krekt wat der barre soe
She wants to talk.	Se prate wol.
I really need to know	Ik moat it echt witte
I have already looked at that.	Dêr haw ik al nei sjoen.
I think they want that.	Ik tink dat se dat wolle.
I could stay, he thought	Ik koe bliuwe, tocht er
It does not matter.	It makket neat út.
I should probably be up soon	Ik soe miskien gau sa op wêze moatte
I would say he ate it	Ik soe sizze hy iet it
It's the people who do not worry.	It binne de minsken dy't gjin soargen hawwe.
He really got into it.	Hy kaam der echt yn.
I'm really kind of hurt	Ik bin echt soarte fan sear
I would never give my kids such a name	Ik soe myn bern noait sa'n namme jaan
Must be, she thought.	Moast wêze, tocht se.
We can do it.	Wy kinne it dwaan.
I wish it would make me a better person	Ik woe dat it my in better persoan meitsje soe
I liked being around him and doing things with him	Ik mocht graach om him hinne wêze en dingen mei him dwaan
I'm really interested in it.	Ik bin der echt ynteressearre yn.
Something needs to be done about that	Dêr moat wat oan dien wurde
Here is just here.	Hier is gewoan hier.
That's not why people want them.	Dat is net wêrom't minsken se wolle.
Well, she's late.	No, se is let.
He tried not to hurt her.	Hy besocht har net sear te dwaan.
I can not believe they know it there	Ik kin net leauwe dat se it dêr witte
That all came out of nowhere.	Dat alles út it neat kaam.
Well, not at all.	No, net hielendal neat.
Hopefully one day she could do that with everyone.	Hoopje dat se op in dei dat mei elkenien dwaan koe.
I talked about it, but it was not really out there.	Ik hie it der oer, mar it wie der net echt út.
There was nothing else.	Der wie neat oars.
It's not much, but it's home.	It is net folle, mar it is thús.
I'm not the person you take me for.	Ik bin net de persoan foar wa't jo my nimme.
Sad people, sad people.	Sear minsken, sear minsken.
Nothing happens then.	Der bart dan neat.
Then it would be the following.	Dan soe it der de folgjende wêze.
I think he went to your house after	Ik tink hy gie nei jo hûs nei
I just wanted to think	Ik woe gewoan tinke
I knew exactly what they were thinking	Ik wist krekt wat se yn gedachten hiene
We have the time.	Wy hawwe de tiid.
She did not run away.	Se rûn net fuort.
I would have, if it was me	Ik soe hawwe, as it wie my
I can make you one better	Ik kin dy ien better dwaan
It's not that simple.	It is net sa gewoan.
I kept looking back and so did he	Ik bleau werom sjen en hy ek
Believe me, you do not want to look at it.	Leau my, jo wolle der net nei sjen.
I hope we can remain friends	Ik hoopje dat wy freonen kinne bliuwe
I think enough has been done for today	Ik tink dat der genôch dien is foar hjoed
I want you to go back to bed now	Ik wol dat jo no wer op bêd geane
And he had to have.	En hy moast hawwe.
None of us has.	Gjin fan ús hat.
Well, none of this will be easy.	No, neat fan dit sil maklik wêze.
All year round.	It hiele jier troch.
I know exactly what she would say	Ik wit krekt wat se soe sizze
Why do.	Wêrom dogge .
I have never been, nor know anyone who lives there	Ik haw nea west, noch ken immen dy't wennet dêr
It can even work.	It kin sels wurkje.
He did not come this time.	Hy kaam dizze kear net.
Try it if you think it will work for you.	Besykje it as jo tinke dat it foar jo sil wurkje.
I did not know what to do or where to go	Ik wist net wat ik dwaan moast of wêr't ik hinne moast
We do not even know where it is.	Wy witte net iens wêr't it is.
He says nothing happened.	Hy seit dat der neat bard is.
Better.	Better.
And also in you.	En ek yn dy.
I did not ask for things back	Ik frege net om dingen werom
He worries him a bit.	Hy makket him wat soargen.
She wants to.	Se wol.
Well, let me tell you why.	No, lit my jo fertelle wêrom.
I could not believe this really happened	Ik koe net leauwe dat dit echt barde
But clearly he did no more for us.	Mar dúdlik die er net mear foar ús.
Waiting for someone to come.	Wachtsje op ien om te kommen.
I can tell you what they say	Ik kin jo fertelle wat se sizze
I believe she's scared	Ik leau dat se bang is
And you out there with him.	En do út dêr mei him.
Such is life.	Sa is it libben.
I know there's a guy	Ik wit dat der in keardel is
I do not know what it is, exactly.	Ik wit net wat it is, krekt.
Keep it up !.	Gean sa troch !.
Whatever happened was never enough.	Wat der ek gie, wie nea genôch.
I could not believe he was waiting for me for so long	Ik koe net leauwe dat er sa lang op my wachte
I knew something had happened	Ik wist dat der wat bard wie
But you need to know the truth.	Mar jo moatte de wierheid witte.
I will stop to look into it	Ik sil ophâlde om der nei te sjen
I can not let you	Ik kin dy net litte litte
I continue to the last car	Ik gean troch nei de lêste auto
Or maybe she's in the house.	Of miskien is se yn 'e hûs.
He came in.	Hy kaam yn.
Well, maybe it did, but this time not.	No, miskien die it, mar dizze kear net.
Ask your mother.	Freegje dyn mem.
We will eat.	Wy sille ite.
He says it's better to go now.	Hy seit dat it better is om no te gean.
But lately, they've not been too nice to me.	Mar de lêste tiid binne se net al te aardich foar my.
I heard it this morning	Ik hearde it fan 'e moarn
Of course, something else is the problem.	Fansels is wat oars it probleem.
I got there too late	Ik kaam der te let
I was sick and you visited me	Ik wie siik en jo hawwe my besocht
You have to go back to school with us.	Jo moatte mei ús werom nei skoalle.
All my kids love them too.	Al myn bern hâlde se ek.
I had to have it.	Ik moast it hawwe.
I want you to take care of me	Ik wol dat jo om my soargje
I just did not like it that much.	Ik fûn it gewoan net sa folle.
I've heard you.	Ik haw dy heard.
I wondered if he had a family	Ik frege my ôf oft hy in famylje hie
It was her last chance to speak.	It wie har lêste kâns om te praten.
First, do something for yourself.	Earst dogge jo wat foar jo.
I should have thought	Ik hie tinke moatten
I knew all your family	Ik koe al dyn famylje
I would not stop this time	Ik soe dizze kear net ophâlde
I did not even hear him come into the room	Ik hearde him net iens yn 'e keamer kommen
A man who wants to find the way home	In man dy't de wei nei hûs fine wol
It's obviously nothing of the sort.	It is fansels neat fan it soarte.
I can not tell them to go home	Ik kin har net sizze dat se nei hûs gean
I can not believe they'll keep you here forever	Ik kin net leauwe dat se jo hjir foar altyd hâlde
It was all for him.	It wie alles foar him.
But not as much as you might think.	Mar net sa folle as jo miskien tinke.
For some reason he heard.	Om ien of oare reden hearde er.
Over and out.	Oer en út.
But we have to be careful.	Mar wy moatte foarsichtich wêze.
But when she did, she never talked to me.	Mar as se it die, hat se noait mei my praat.
His door opened and it was his father.	Syn doar gie iepen en it wie syn heit.
I came out to find you.	Ik kaam út om dy te finen.
I believe we will all agree on this here.	Ik leau dat wy it hjir allegear oer iens wurde.
I think we should have tried	Ik tink dat wy moatte hawwe besocht
And so it had to be.	En sa moast it wêze.
They would not have been the first.	Se soene net de earste west hawwe.
Just about everything will do.	Krekt oer alles sil dwaan.
Come with me, leave me in your room.	Kom mei, lit my yn dyn keamer.
More than likely both.	Mear dan wierskynlik beide.
I hope it does not come through me	Ik hoopje dat it net troch my komt
It's hard to find more.	It is min te finen mear.
I thought you were my friend too	Ik tocht dat jo myn freon ek wiene
It needs a door.	It hat in doar nedich.
I have a family again	Ik haw wer in famylje
She could tell him everything and she did.	Se koe him alles fertelle en dat die se.
You find that too.	Dat fine jo ek.
I love people and love people for being.	Ik hâld fan minsken en hâld fan minsken om te wêzen.
I did not know what had hit me	Ik wist net wat my rekke hie
I know what you're thinking	Ik wit wat jo tinke
I do not feel so good today.	Ik fiel my hjoed net sa goed.
I knew the girl who did it	Ik koe it famke dat it die
It has nothing to do with you or with me.	It hat neat mei dy of mei my te krijen.
I have the same problem	Ik haw itselde probleem
She worries him, but does not want to talk about it.	Se makket him wat soargen, mar woe der net oer prate.
And that is not all.	En dêr hâldt it noch net op.
I could not believe what I had just seen	Ik koe net leauwe wat ik krekt sjoen hie
He has me now.	Hy hat my no.
I had no idea how long	Ik hie gjin idee hoe lang
He's sure on the way.	Hy is der wis fan op wei.
It will not hurt him.	It sil him gjin sear dwaan.
It was just very hard work.	It wie gewoan hiel hurd wurk.
I can see it, clearly.	Ik kin it sjen, dúdlik.
He started again.	Hy begûn wer.
Maybe she has not seen it at all.	Miskien hat se it hielendal net sjoen.
I did not even think it was her.	Ik tocht net iens dat it har wie.
I hope nothing happened	Ik hoopje dat der neat bard is
I got him to come to me and stay	Ik krige him om by my te kommen en te bliuwen
They like to play it that way.	Se spylje it graach sa.
She had nothing to do with him.	Se hie neat mei him te krijen.
I could not do this again	Ik koe dit net wer dwaan
Let it be a year old.	Lit it in jier âld wurde.
I can see through you	Ik kin troch dy hinne sjen
I love all of this, if asked	Ik hâld fan dit alles, as it frege wurdt
It came again.	It kaam wer.
I had thought it would be different	Ik hie tocht dat it oars soe wêze
Take care of your family.	Soargje foar jo famylje.
Who would have thought that a few years ago.	Wa hie dat in pear jier lyn oait tocht.
But from now on, you let him be.	Mar fan no ôf litte jo him wêze.
And that was that for her mother.	En dat wie dat foar har mem.
I hardly found you in time	Ik haw dy hast net op tiid fûn
I feel like you know this.	Ik fiel dat jo dit witte.
I did not know it at all	Ik wist it hielendal net
And it's just that.	En it is krekt dat.
I wish you had told me	Ik winskje datsto it my ferteld hiest
That seemed like a lot.	Dat like wat folle.
I've never found him before	Ik haw him noch noait fûn
You have to come and see.	Jo moatte komme en sjen.
It's too early.	It is te betiid.
Maybe, maybe not.	Miskien, miskien net.
He wanted her to know he heard her.	Hy woe dat se wist dat er har hearde.
And for sure, it.	En foar wis, it.
We do not address this issue.	Wy hoege en dogge dat probleem net oan.
I sat on my bed	Ik siet op myn bêd
Maybe that's really where we need to go.	Miskien is dat echt wêr't wy nei moatte.
But she was just not sure.	Mar se wie gewoan net wis.
I can say he does not want to ask me	Ik kin sizze dat hy my net freegje wol
Nobody needed to know.	Nimmen moast it witte.
I'm sure you'll find someone else there	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo d'r immen oars sille fine
And he loves his job	En hy hâldt fan syn wurk
He had done that to his friend.	Hy hie dat oan syn freon dien.
Let no one show you.	Lit gjinien dy sjen.
We will find one for you.	Wy sille ien foar jo fine.
I tried to wake him up, but he is it	Ik besocht him wekker te meitsjen, mar hy is it
I do not know what that was	Ik wit net wat dat wie
I bought everything	Ik kocht alles
I knew it would never work	Ik wist dat it soe nea wurkje
You can see nothing.	Jo kinne neat sjen.
He knew he was not thinking well.	Hy wist dat er net goed tocht.
I will not help you with this	Ik sil jo net helpe mei dizze
Could be, he said.	Kin wêze, sei er.
They're going out there now.	Se geane der no út.
Everything at hand.	Alles by de hân.
Said nothing.	Sei neat.
I would do anything to take it away	Ik soe alles dwaan om it fuort te nimmen
I can no longer see	Ik kin net mear sjen
Two of us were told to go along with it.	Twa fan ús waard ferteld om der mei oan te gean.
I was not talking.	Ik wie net oan it praten.
I obviously do not know how to put it in there.	Ik wit fansels net hoe't ik it der yn sette moat.
I really have no idea how	Ik haw echt gjin idee hoe
She was not like that before.	Se wie net sa earder.
I told him what we had seen	Ik fertelde him wat wy sjoen hiene
I wanted to talk to this man	Ik woe mei dizze man prate
The house they did not have.	It hûs hiene se net.
I asked her to talk to both of us	Ik frege har om mei ús beide te praten
I know bad things happen	Ik wit dat minne dingen barre
This is your car to drive now.	Dit is jo auto om no te riden.
I talk to everyone.	Ik praat mei elkenien.
I'll find a way to come back.	Ik sil in manier fine om werom te kommen.
I actually did not know anyone else so well	Ik koe eins net ien oars sa goed
I love her as much as ever	Ik hâld fan har safolle as altyd
I also heard him say nothing against the woman	Ik hearde him ek neat tsjin de frou sizze
Everyone saw what happened.	Elkenien seach wat der barde.
I doubt you can afford it	Ik twifelje oan dat jo it kinne betelje
The house is ours.	It hûs is fan ús.
It's not there tonight.	It is der fannacht net.
I also seem to have done well	Ik lykje ek goed dien te hawwen
I'm not afraid of you	Ik bin net bang foar dy
I quickly looked around the room	Ik seach gau om 'e keamer
There is something more.	Dêr is wat mear.
You never go home, not really.	Jo geane noait nei hûs, net echt.
How well done this is.	Hoe goed dit te hawwen dien.
I would love to be with him	Ik mocht graach by him wêze
We knew what was going on, but no one was talking about it.	Wy wisten wat der oan de hân wie, mar nimmen hie it der oer.
I could see it was very well made	Ik koe sjen dat it wie hiel goed makke
I'm having a meeting tomorrow	Ik haw moarn in gearkomste
And again and again.	En wer en wer.
I would just take the money	Ik soe it jild mar nimme
Not sure what's going on.	Net wis wat der bart.
I found it myself	Ik fûn it sels
She's still there.	Se is der noch.
We work with everyone.	Wy wurkje mei elkenien.
I do not have the time for that.	Dêr ha ik de tiid net foar.
I hope they were both good	Ik hope dat se beide goed wiene
Also not just for food.	Ek net allinnich foar iten.
I could see how she felt	Ik koe sjen hoe't se fielde
I want my house.	Ik wol myn hûs.
But it is not clear.	Mar it is net dúdlik.
Her father is a cautious man.	Har heit is in foarsichtich man.
I'm with you, man.	Ik bin der by dy, man.
That, of course, is the best way to go about it.	Dat is fansels de bêste manier om te gean oer it.
You used to love school.	Jo hâlde eartiids fan skoalle.
Maybe other times but it really did not need it.	Miskien oare kear mar it hie it echt net nedich.
I wondered if he knew who my mother was	Ik frege my ôf oft er wist wa't myn mem wie
I used to think nothing of it.	Ik tocht der eartiids neat fan.
She tried to help him.	Se besocht him te helpen.
Come for help.	Kom foar help.
Ask him out well.	Freegje him út.
I will not say another word.	Ik sil gjin wurd mear sizze.
Well, maybe not in the same way.	No, miskien net op deselde manier.
They need to be needed.	Se moatte nedich wêze.
Everything is different now.	Alles is no oars.
Many people agree with you	In protte minsken binne it mei dy iens
I see it.	Ik sjoch it.
Make the most of it.	Meitsje der it bêste fan.
But he needs to think about coming back.	Mar hy moat tinke oer werom te kommen.
I'm not needed.	Ik bin net nedich.
I did not really know what to get him	Ik wist net echt wat ik him krije moast
All right, he said.	Goed, sei er.
I took the money	Ik naam it jild
He had to tell her.	Hy moast it har fertelle.
He goes out.	Hy giet út.
I was just wondering	Ik frege my der gewoan ôf
I need someone to help me with them	Ik haw ien nedich om my mei har te helpen
Now we will do whatever you want.	No sille wy wat dwaan dat jo wolle.
He gave in to what he had.	Hy joech yn wat er hie.
Been very busy with other things.	Hiel drok west mei oare dingen.
I can only see the same thing	Ik kin allinnich sjen itselde
For some reason, they had a lot left over.	Om ien of oare reden hiene se in protte oer.
I would love to talk to you	Ik mocht graach mei dy prate
I want him to look at me	Ik wol dat er nei my sjocht
I could not stay there	Ik koe dêr net bliuwe
That's what I wanted to see.	Dat woe ik sjen.
You're never home.	Do bist noait thús.
I still remember you talking a lot	Ik wit noch dat jo in protte prate
He looked very tired.	Hy seach wurch wurch.
Let's see now.	Lit ús no sjen.
I can not be beautiful.	Ik kin net moai wêze.
I could not get to him	Ik koe net by him komme
I probably need to get ready to go	Ik moat my wierskynlik klear meitsje om te gean
I said you were with her	Ik sei dat jo by har wiene
They have not.	Se hawwe net.
But all is well.	Mar alles is goed.
I just want to know how it is with her	Ik wol gewoan witte hoe't it mei har is
Man, he could not go home now.	Man, hy koe no net nei hûs.
I have an idea that you might like.	Ik haw in idee dat jo miskien leuk fine.
I'm here often, and it often comes out well	Ik bin hjir faak, en it komt faak goed út
Hope all is well.	Hoopje dat alles goed is.
It had not been too bad a weekend.	It hie net al te min in wykein west.
I was scared of that too	Ik wie der ek bang foar
I can give you everything here	Ik kin jo hjir alles jaan
Your problems are our problems.	Jo problemen binne ús problemen.
She could tell he needed someone like her.	Se koe fertelle dat hy ien as har nedich hie.
She's happy.	Se is bliid.
Please see my photo.	Sjoch asjebleaft myn foto.
Of course, that was not true.	Fansels wie dat net wier.
In fact, it was beautiful.	Eins wie it moai.
I know she's wrong.	Ik wit dat se ferkeard is.
We have no idea what's going on.	Wy hawwe gjin idee wat der bart.
I gave up pretty easily.	Ik joech frij maklik op.
Your friends have not found us.	Jo freonen hawwe ús net fûn.
To my wife.	Oan myn frou.
I was not looking forward to it at all	Ik seach der hielendal net nei út
You never win such a thing.	Jo winne noait sa'n ding.
I'm so sorry, people	It spyt my tige, minsken
I would say they are true to size.	Ik soe sizze dat se wier binne foar grutte.
I thought one would be enough	Ik tocht dat ien genôch wêze soe
I had started a book that day	Ik wie dy dei begûn mei in boek
You obviously have to do what you want.	Jo moatte fansels dwaan wat jo wolle.
We need to do it now.	Wy moatte it no dwaan.
I do not think they are real.	Ik tink net dat se echt binne.
I know she wants me to wait for her	Ik wit dat se wol dat ik op har wachtsje sil
I was sure it would be good	Ik wie der wis fan dat it goed soe wêze
Good is not good enough.	Goed is net goed genôch.
Everything is mine.	Alles is my.
I've had enough of that too	Ik ha der ek genôch fan
And they want me.	En se wolle my.
I think you did it here	Ik tink dat jo it hjir dien hawwe
We had looked into each other.	Wy hiene yn elkoar sjoen.
A girl who just looked like her	In famke dat krekt op har like
I even know the man's name.	Ik wit sels de namme fan de man.
I make more for family and friends.	Ik meitsje mear foar famylje en freonen.
Think of the people in the movie.	Tink oan de minsken yn 'e film.
And eating almost not enough.	En ite hast net genôch.
I'm trying to pretend it's not real	Ik besykje te dwaan as dat it net echt is
I thought he might be one of you	Ik tocht dat hy miskien fan jo wie
I just said nothing.	Ik sei gewoan neat.
I think it says a lot	Ik tink dat it in protte seit
He did not eat.	Hy iet net.
I was still waiting for her to come home	Ik wachte noch oant se thús kaam
And you know we need it.	En jo witte dat wy it nedich hawwe.
He was a bad person.	Hy wie in min persoan.
Well, if the truth is told.	No, as de wierheid wurdt ferteld.
I do not, of course.	Ik doch it net, fansels.
My daughter.	Myn famke.
She would not make this easy for him.	Se soe him dit net maklik meitsje.
I did not know the words	Ik koe de wurden net
You just never get the chance to do that	Jo krije gewoan noait de kâns om dat te dwaan
I need to take better care of my family.	Ik moat better foar myn famylje soargje.
I never wanted to leave	Ik woe noait fuort
I was a father	Ik wie in heit
To do otherwise would be too long.	Om oars te dwaan soe it te lang wêze.
I have no idea who it is	Ik ha gjin idee wa't it is
I did not know what to do	Ik wist net wat ik oan moast
I did not think of that	Dêr tocht ik net oan
Too much time.	Te folle tiid.
I would like to know more.	Ik wol graach mear witte.
I had not seen much of her lately	Ik hie de lêste tiid net folle fan har sjoen
I'm glad you're on time.	Ik bin bliid dat jo op 'e tiid binne.
That was you.	Dat wie dy.
You do not get that.	Dat krije jo net.
I did not see what it was	Ik seach net wat it wie
I will never see her again.	Ik sil har noait wer sjen.
I want to, but.	Ik wol wol, mar.
Now it's decided.	No is it besletten.
All the children were afraid of him.	Alle bern wiene bang foar him.
And another and then another.	En noch ien en dan noch ien.
I must be free.	Ik moat frij wêze.
It's just beautiful when it happens.	It is gewoan moai as it bart.
So did he.	Dat sei er ek.
Hours every day.	Oeren alle dagen.
He may have felt the same way.	Hy kin hawwe fielde deselde manier.
Boy, could she talk.	Jonge, koe se prate.
I'm going here.	Ik gean hjir.
I think you might.	Ik tink dat jo miskien.
There was not much left.	Der wiene net folle mear oer.
Someone does it.	Immen docht it.
And they are working hard on them now.	En se wurkje no hurd oan har.
Or maybe it would.	Of miskien soe it.
She was my friend too.	Se wie myn freon ek.
I walked away last time without telling her the truth	Ik rûn de lêste kear fuort sûnder har de wierheid te fertellen
I thought of my mother	Ik tocht oan myn mem
I will love you.	Ik sil fan dy hâlde.
I know it's hard.	Ik wit dat it dreech is.
She wanted to see people.	Se woe minsken sjen.
It should take time.	It moat tiid nimme.
But that came up.	Mar dat kaam op.
In fact, he said not a word.	Eins sei er gjin wurd.
I could not see who it was	Ik koe net sjen wa't it wie
I told him never to talk to me again.	Ik fertelde him om noait wer mei my te praten.
Until the next.	Oant de folgjende.
He can not see everyone to see who got in there first.	Hy kin net elkenien sjen om te sjen wa't der earst yn kaam.
I think we should see.	Ik tink dat wy moatte sjen.
It really did.	It die echt.
Maybe that was it.	Miskien wie dat it.
We're better than this, people.	Wy binne better as dit, minsken.
Do this until you know what else to do.	Doch dat dan, oant jo witte wat jo oars moatte dwaan.
Many people were on this	In protte minsken wiene op dit
I ran for it.	Ik rûn der foar.
I was too late, but here it was.	Ik wie te let, mar hjir wie it.
Tell him that for me.	Fertel him dat foar my.
Everyone is there.	Elkenien is der by.
I was never that good at that either	Dêr wie ik ek noait sa goed yn
All my friends, of course, have before.	Al myn freonen, fansels, hawwe earder.
I did not even know he had it	Ik wist net iens dat er it hie
If anyone needs to have it, they should.	As immen it hawwe moat, dan moatte se.
It may have been from her.	It kin fan har west hawwe.
Maybe a little better.	Miskien wat better.
I could not even tell you what's in it	Ik koe jo net iens fertelle wat der yn sit
It was her only hope.	It wie har ienige hope.
Someone comes up but nothing happens.	Der komt wol ien op mar der bart neat.
I could not talk to her	Ik koe net mei har prate
I'm talking about this.	Ik haw it oer dit.
First an hour, then two, then three.	Earst in oere, dan twa, dan trije.
My mother met me there.	Myn mem moete my dêr.
He had done it.	Hy hie it dien.
But they will be kept.	Mar se sille hâlden wurde.
She was sure she would never see her husband again.	Se wie der wis fan dat se har man noait wer sjen soe.
She was as angry as she was scared.	Se wie like lilk as se bang wie.
That would be Dad.	Dat soe heit wêze.
I have no husband.	Ik haw gjin man.
I hope you enjoy coming here often	Ik hoopje dat jo it leuk fine om hjir faak te kommen
He had never done that before.	Dat hie er noch nea dien.
I asked where she was	Ik frege wêr't se wie
I made a bit of it	Ik makke der in bytsje fan
See what they have done before.	Sjoch wat se earder dien hawwe.
Were very real.	Wiene hiel echt.
He looked up at me.	Hy seach my op.
Not with me, mind.	Net by my, tink.
We were up first.	Wy wiene earst op.
I have to think.	Ik moat tinke.
I could not say which	Ik koe net sizze hokker
I asked her the time	Ik frege har de tiid
And this was not for just a few hours.	En dit wie net foar mar in pear oeren.
He's another guy.	Hy is in oare keardel.
I believe in her words first	Ik leau earst yn har wurden
I have never tried it again.	Ik haw it noait wer besocht.
Not on time.	Net op tiid.
So we stay in.	Sa bliuwe wy yn.
She wanted to do that herself.	Dat woe se sels dwaan.
That was clear long ago.	Dat wie lang lyn dúdlik.
That's the problem.	Dat is it probleem.
There may be just enough for both of us.	Der kin krekt genôch wêze foar ús beide.
I'm just looking at her right now	Ik sjoch no krekt nei har
I hope this goes easily for you today	Ik hoopje dat hjoed foar jo maklik giet
I had never seen it like this before.	Ik hie it noch noait sa sjoen.
I could not tell you anything about this	Ik koe dy neat fan dit fertelle
I told him to do it for me	Ik fertelde him om it foar my te dwaan
You do not have to take it.	Jo hoege it net te nimmen.
Well, see you soon.	No, oant sjen.
I thought it would be nice.	Ik tocht dat it moai wêze soe.
But this does not seem to be easy.	Mar dizze liket net maklik te wurden.
I wanted to get out of here	Ik woe hjir wei
It works very well.	It wurket hiel goed.
I was already pretty sure, but was not sure who	Ik wie al aardich wis, mar wie net wis fan wa
I will not tell you about you	Ik sil dy net fertelle oer dy
Of course, many things do not work.	Fansels wurkje dan in protte dingen net.
I still felt it, and so did he.	Ik fielde it noch, en hy ek.
I could not leave them there like that	Ik koe se der sa net litte
They become family.	Se wurde famylje.
I had made very good friends there	Ik hie dêr tige goede freonen makke
He had, of course, read the book.	Hy hie fansels it boek lêzen.
A young woman opened the door	In jonge frou die de doar iepen
One or two can stay.	Ien of twa kinne bliuwe.
That was my husband too.	Dat wie myn man ek.
I was never good enough	Ik wie nea goed genôch
I wish it was different	Ik woe dat it oars wie
There is a job to be done.	Der is in wurk te dwaan.
I need to find my mom	Ik moat myn mem fine
A man could only take so much	In man koe mar safolle nimme
Life is not like that.	It libben is net sa.
Knew it well.	Wist it goed.
We could eat something though.	Wy koene wol wat te iten.
I want to see you so badly	Ik wol dy sa min sjen
I could never have done it without him	Ik koe it noait sûnder him
You know I am.	Jo witte dat ik it bin.
I could see why people would want to hurt him	Ik koe sjen wêrom't minsken soene wolle sear him
This is all true.	Dit is allegear wier.
Maybe he could help her.	Miskien koe er har helpe.
Everyone is there.	Elkenien is der.
A little here, a little there.	In bytsje hjir, in bytsje dêr.
He's like that, give him a dog and he's happy.	Hy is sa, jou him in hûn en hy is bliid.
I knew she had a lot.	Ik wist dat se in protte hie.
I was here a few years ago but had to leave	Ik wie hjir in pear jier lyn, mar moast fuort
She did not want to.	Se woe net.
This does not happen often, but enough to be a problem.	Dit bart net faak, mar genôch om in probleem te wêzen.
I had to agree with her	Ik moast it mei har iens wêze
It's so fun.	It is sa leuk.
Look out for that !.	Sjoch dêr nei út!.
I can not believe you did this to me	Ik kin net leauwe dat jo dit my dien hawwe
Or even a child.	Of sels in bern.
I can not give you more without taking something from him	Ik kin dy net mear jaan sûnder him wat te nimmen
You can believe by having it.	Jo kinne leauwe troch it te hawwen.
I think it's going well	Ik tink dat it goed komt
I think this is the way of these things	Ik tink dat dit de manier is fan dizze dingen
You do not have to do this.	Jo moatte dit net dwaan.
I think it works well.	Ik tink dat it wurket goed.
I have to wait until tomorrow	Ik moat wachtsje oant moarn
I told you we were going to be friends	Ik sei dy dat wy freonen wurde soene
I needed nothing more	Ik hie neat mear nedich
I waited, and waited.	Ik wachte, en wachte.
But they should not.	Mar se moatte net.
please help me.	asjebleaft help my.
I can not tell you anymore	Ik kin dy net mear fertelle
It was just like with her mother.	It wie krekt as by har mem.
But never twice the same, 'he said.	Mar nea twa kear itselde,' sei er.
If they have time.	As se tiid hawwe.
I will do all this first.	Ik sil dit alles earst meitsje.
There was no time she was not there for me.	Der wie gjin tiid dat se der net foar my wie.
So it was here.	Sa wie it hjir.
Maybe you can make him better	Miskien kinne jo him better meitsje
I was really surprised	Ik wie echt ferrast
I would not ask for help or things	Ik soe net freegje om help of dingen
It happens to me.	It bart my.
This is probably for the best.	Dit is wierskynlik foar it bêste.
I thought he was out with friends	Ik tocht dat hy wie út mei freonen
Or maybe it will.	Of miskien wol.
I was just sitting here, alive	Ik siet hjir krekt, libben
I believe in it.	Ik leau der yn.
I can work all hours	Ik kin alle oeren wurkje
It does not get better than this.	It wurdt net better as dit.
I'm scared.	Ik bin bang foar.
And they are much more.	En se binne noch folle mear.
He would not do it again.	Hy soe it net wer dwaan.
He was in it clearly.	Hy wie yn it dúdlik.
I asked him if he had ever tried it	Ik frege him oft er it oait besocht hat
I had nothing to do but go home	Ik hie neat oars te dwaan as nei hûs ta
I love everything about him	Ik hâld fan alles oer him
I love her here with me	Ik hâld fan har hjir by my
We'm sure you agree.	Wy binne wis dat jo it iens binne.
I just want you to be good	Ik wol gewoan dat jo goed binne
I just did not know what you were thinking about this	Ik wist gewoan net dat jo hjir oer tinke
He knew it for a long time.	Hy wist it al lang.
It was a beautiful life for us here.	It wie hjir in moai libben foar ús.
And, somehow, it actually works.	En, op ien of oare manier, wurket it eins.
Quite a bit in the last year.	Hiel wat yn it lêste jier.
I had never seen her like this before.	Ik hie har noch noait sa sjoen.
He asked her.	Hy frege har.
He just knows how good he is.	Hy wit net hoe goed hy is.
I just thought they would always be here	Ik tocht gewoan dat se hjir altyd wêze soene
But this morning he was sure, as never before.	Mar op dizze moarn wie er wis, as nea earder.
Wait and see.	Wachtsje en sjoch.
I love people who say what they think	Ik hâld fan minsken dy't sizze wat se tinke
It can be said.	It kin sein wurde.
People who want hope.	Minsken dy't hope wolle.
I expected him to return	Ik ferwachte dat hy werom soe
Needless to say, he looks very good.	Moat sizze, hy sjocht der wol hiel goed út.
We are open now.	Wy binne no iepen.
We actually do not know for sure.	Wy witte it eins net wis.
Everything you think is work.	Alles wat jo tinke is wurk.
Many people were surprised	In protte minsken wiene ferrast
I assume you would be	Ik nim oan dat jo wêze soene
I told him exactly what had happened	Ik fertelde him krekt wat der bard wie
I probably always will be	Ik sil wierskynlik altyd wêze
I look at her.	Ik sjoch nei har.
I'm sure you can not wait for that	Ik bin der wis fan dat jo dêr net op wachtsje kinne
It became clear that there was a plan.	It waard dúdlik dat der in plan wie.
She knew you were gone.	Se wist wol dat jo fuort wiene.
I want one thing and only one thing	Ik wol ien ding en mar ien ding
I do not want more.	Ik wol net mear.
He did not know what to make of the letter.	Hy wist net wat er fan de brief meitsje moast.
I still remember seeing my father sick of me	Ik wit noch dat ik myn heit oer my siik seach
I expected a lot and got so much more.	Ik ferwachte in protte en krige safolle mear.
I have nothing to be angry about	Ik haw neat om lilk oer te wêzen
But one question.	Mar ien fraach.
Maybe nothing.	Miskien neat.
And well, you should not.	En goed, jo moatte net.
I hope you are the same as we are	Ik hoopje dat jo op deselde manier binne as wy
I had decided to come home	Ik hie besletten om thús te kommen
And this is actually true.	En dit is eins wier.
I only see if you play	Ik sjoch allinnich as jo spylje
I lived with my mother.	Ik wenne by myn mem.
I see you made it back	Ik sjoch dat jo it werom makke hawwe
I do not want to do these things	Ik wol dizze dingen net dwaan
And there she saw him.	En dêr seach se him.
If we leave it.	As wy it litte.
We can do the same here.	Wy kinne hjir itselde dwaan.
I do not go often.	Ik gean net faak.
Everything he said was true.	Alles wat hy sei wie wier.
He had a job for me.	Hy hie in baan foar my.
Help me help him.	Help my him te helpen.
We are among friends here.	Wy binne ûnder freonen hjir.
But the work does not stop.	Mar it wurk hâldt net op.
I did not know what would happen to me	Ik wist net wat der mei my barre soe
We take him back.	Wy nimme him werom.
Your best friend.	Dyn bêste freon.
I would need it to get through this	Ik soe it nedich hawwe om troch dit te kommen
Maybe the only thing.	Miskien it ienige ding.
It can be done well or badly.	It kin goed of min dien wurde.
I'm really trying to keep up with her	Ik besykje it echt te hâlden mei har
That is with us too.	Dat is ek mei ús.
I'm too free for that.	Ik bin dêr te frij foar.
I could not win.	Ik koe net winne.
What had to happen.	Wat moast barre.
I need some time to figure out my life	Ik haw wat tiid nedich om myn libben út te finen
She took me home.	Se naam my mei nei hûs.
Please help us.	Help ús asjebleaft.
Try it on.	Besykje it op.
For a few years.	Foar in pear jier.
Now she would have to do something.	No soe se wat dwaan moatte.
I do now.	Ik doch no.
Your kids are very good.	Jo bern binne hiel goed.
They can not get enough.	Se kinne net genôch krije.
He was just a word to me.	Hy wie mar in wurd foar my.
Her family comes and sees her	Har famylje komt en sjocht har
Now they would never.	No soene se noait.
She will, of course.	Se sil, fansels.
I stayed out late the next evening.	Ik bleau de folgjende jûn let út.
I had not expected that for a long time	Dat hie ik noch lang net ferwachte
They are so beautiful.	Se binne sa moai.
I had never heard of one before	Ik hie noch nea heard fan ien foar
I never want to hurt anyone again	Ik wol noait wer ien sear dwaan
She had not come up with things.	Se wie net mei dingen kommen.
I do not even look at her.	Ik sjoch net iens nei har.
Then again, it can not.	Dan wer kin it net.
I did not touch her much	Ik rekke har net folle oan
I did get my hands on it.	Ik ha der wol de hân fan hân.
All at once.	Alles yn ien kear.
His wife once did it too.	Syn frou die it eartiids ek.
I really did not know what to think now	Ik wist echt net wat ik no tinke moast
Well, there would have been some of that, even in our time.	No, dêr hiene der wol wat fan west, ek yn ús tiid.
And you do it very well.	En jo dogge it hiel goed.
I was surprised and happy to see him there	Ik wie ferrast en bliid om him dêr te sjen
That's what it's for.	Dêr is it foar.
This meeting took place.	Dizze gearkomste fûn plak.
I told him no chance.	Ik sei tsjin him gjin kâns.
But we did it and everything went well.	Mar wy diene it en alles gie goed.
You were wrong.	Jo wiene ferkeard.
Or maybe not.	Of se miskien net.
Many of you have probably seen it too.	In protte fan jo hawwe it wierskynlik ek sjoen.
It's like.	It is as .
I did not do it for the money	Ik haw it net dien foar it jild
Just look hard and tell me everything.	Sjoch mar hurd en fertel my alles.
Maybe no one knew who he was.	Miskien wist nimmen wa't hy wie.
She was still angry at him.	Se wie noch lilk op him.
And so he was, if that's what you were after.	En sa wie hy, as dat is wat jo wiene nei.
I only needed a few more days	Ik hie noch mar in pear dagen nedich
I know how good that would go	Ik wit hoe goed dat gean soe
I could not eat.	Ik koe net ite.
Not so long ago.	Net sa lang lyn.
I tried to find even more	Ik besocht noch mear te finen
He would always make time.	Hy soe altyd tiid meitsje.
I can 't agree with that either	Ik kin hjir ek net mei
I wanted to make sure he never did that again	Ik woe der wis fan wêze dat er dat noait wer die
I want to know everything about you	Ik wol alles oer dy witte
I would not like to stay in it	Ik soe der net graach yn bliuwe
But here's what we do.	Mar hjir is wat wy dogge.
I'm over there now	Ik bin der no hinne
I do not know what he said	Ik wit net wat er sei
It happens from time to time.	It bart fan tiid ta tiid.
But no one knows.	Mar nimmen wit it.
It does not do it now.	It docht it no net.
I would also like to go home	Ik soe ek graach nei hûs ta
It's about the child.	It giet om it bern.
Never found to this day.	Nea fûn oant hjoed de dei.
I thought we were ready	Ik tocht dat wy klear wiene
Something has to come of this.	Hjir moat wat fan komme.
I could not be sure.	Ik koe der net wis fan wêze.
It's good to be wrong.	It is goed om ferkeard te wêzen.
But who are sure they should not.	Mar wa binne der wis fan dat se net moatte.
I do not believe anything they say.	Ik leau neat dat se sizze.
We love it was not.	Wy hâlde it wie net.
Now tell me what you know.	No fertel my wat jo witte.
He knew it so well.	Hy wist it sa goed.
Of course, we are both the same now.	Fansels binne wy ​​no beide itselde.
Good, good, good.	Goed, goed, goed.
It happens.	Dit bart.
I was not good.	Ik wie net goed.
I just need to know who will do what.	Ik moat gewoan witte wa't wat sil dwaan.
I think he did something completely different	Ik tink dat er hielendal wat oars die
There's no way he can take back what just happened.	D'r is gjin manier dat hy werom kin nimme wat krekt bard is.
They do the same things they always did.	Se dogge deselde dingen dy't se altyd dien hawwe.
I found your book.	Ik fûn dyn boek.
I did not expect this to go home soon.	Ik hie net ferwachte dit gau nei hûs te gean.
I just know his name	Ik wit gewoan syn namme
It had to be that way.	It moast sa wêze.
But it has.	Mar it hat.
They knew that too.	Dat wisten se ek.
Maybe it was not.	Miskien wie it net.
I was not sure why that was exactly	Ik wie net wis wêrom dat krekt wie
I just think of being who we are	Ik tink gewoan om te wêzen wa't wy binne
You will not ask for a photo.	Jo sille net freegje om in foto.
I had no time for this tonight	Ik hie hjir jûn gjin tiid foar
I would not give them to the girl right now	Ik soe se no krekt net oan it famke jaan
You need to see one.	Jo moatte ien sjen.
Of course they do.	Fansels dogge se dat.
I also want some things	Ik winskje ek wat dingen
I told him he had to come to me now	Ik fertelde him dat hy my no komme moast
I thought everything would be fine	Ik tocht dat alles goed soe wêze
I was sick with worries about my parents, too	Ik wie siik mei soargen oer myn âlden, te
I did not have the time to see anyone else	Ik haw net de tiid hân om immen oars te sjen
I'm not done.	Ik bin net klear.
He made one.	Hy makke ien.
The other hand too.	De oare hân ek.
Nobody told me.	Nimmen fertelde my.
It's very hard to see.	It is hiel dreech om te sjen.
I thought, really nothing	Ik tocht, eins neat
I need to find a way home	Ik moat in wei nei hûs fine
But that's wrong.	Mar dat is ferkeard.
It keeps you going, okay.	It hâldt dy op, goed.
From a year ago.	Fan in jier lyn.
This can be both a good and a bad thing.	Dit kin sawol in goed as in min ding wêze.
They were for nothing.	Se wiene foar neat.
She had gotten what she wanted.	Se hie krigen wat se woe.
I want to say more about that house	Ik wol mear sizze oer dat hûs
I've just always been that way.	Ik haw gewoan altyd sa west.
I hope to see them too	Ik hope se ek te sjen
It was an easy thing to do.	It wie in maklik ding om te dwaan.
It was a car.	It wie in auto.
I hope everything went well	Ik hoopje dat alles goed gien is
I did pretty well in school.	Ik die it aardich goed op skoalle.
We were just the best.	Wy wiene gewoan de bêste.
I think you should do just that	Ik tink dat jo dat krekt dwaan moatte
I wonder why he does this	Ik freegje my ôf wêrom't hy dit docht
I just wanted to get away from the guy	Ik woe gewoan fan de keardel ôf
And you would be right.	En jo soene krekt wêze.
I thought you were something else	Ik tocht dat jo wat oars wiene
I did not know you would do this now	Ik wist net dat jo dit no dwaan soene
Not in bed, but after bed.	Net op bêd, mar nei bêd.
Are still wrong.	Binne noch ferkeard.
No one has hit her yet.	Nimmen hat se noch rekke.
But he needs you.	Mar hy hat dy nedich.
Is that what happened.	Is dat wat bard.
People get angry.	Minsken wurde lilk.
I feel the same about things	Ik fiel itselde oer dingen
It is very clear.	It is hiel dúdlik.
The thing is, you can only do it once.	It ding is, jo kinne it mar ien kear dwaan.
I know you want to know that	Ik wit dat jo dat wol witte
This is about our children.	Dit giet oer ús bern.
These are true.	Dizze binne wier.
It had been easy enough.	It hie maklik genôch west.
I have a job to do.	Ik haw in baan te dwaan.
I'm glad to see you	Ik bin bliid dy te sjen
I still see that and believe it to this day.	Ik sjoch dat noch en leau it oant hjoed de dei.
I want to make this but no money	Ik wol meitsje dit mar gjin jild
I could tell this was not just any girl	Ik koe sizze dat dit gjin gewoan famke wie
That's not enough for me.	Dat is my net genôch.
He's at work.	Hy is oan it wurk.
He never made it.	Hy hat it noait makke.
I've heard enough.	Ik haw genôch heard.
I should leave in a few hours	Ik soe in pear oeren fuort moatte
How about getting out there if you want to, please.	Hoe sit it mei der út komme as jo wolle, asjebleaft.
She's hurting now.	Se docht no sear.
That's where it started.	Dêr is it begûn.
I wonder if she was someone who worked here	Ik freegje my ôf oft se ien wie dy't hjir wurke
It was not the right time.	It wie net de goede tiid.
We would never hurt you.	Wy soene jo noait sear dwaan.
It was his first work of its kind.	It wie syn earste wurk fan dit soarte.
This is obviously wrong.	Dit is fansels ferkeard.
They are there every day.	Dy binne der alle dagen.
Just very bad and wrong and not good.	Krekt hiel min en ferkeard en net goed.
Let me say that first.	Lit my dat earst sizze.
Just ask my wife.	Freegje myn frou mar.
This will remain so.	Dit sil sa bliuwe.
He does them good.	Hy docht se goed.
I love you, without house or money	Ik hâld fan dy, sûnder hûs of jild
But of course not.	Mar fansels net.
We can not.	Wy kinne net.
I tell it to other people	Ik fertel it oan oare minsken
He is one of quite a few.	Hy is ien fan in hiel pear.
I wanted my best friend back.	Ik woe myn bêste freon werom.
But we can not go back now.	Mar wy kinne no net werom.
I know what you did last year	Ik wit wat jo ferline jier dien hawwe
You get a job.	Jo krije in baan.
I have no idea how long it is	Ik ha gjin idee hoe lang it is
I do not know if it still does.	Ik wit net oft it noch docht.
Today is the first day of school.	Hjoed is de earste dei fan skoalle.
I'm in a good place now	Ik bin no op in goed plak
I'll tell you everything	Ik sil dy alles fertelle
I just wanted out.	Ik woe gewoan út.
I believe we have decided	Ik leau dat wy besletten hawwe
I know nothing about it	Ik wit der neat fan
I had to do the same thing myself.	Ik moast itselde ding sels dwaan.
There may be more where this came from.	Der kinne mear wêze wêr't dit wei kaam.
I have to believe that	Dat moat ik leauwe
There are still problems, they are working on.	Der bliuwe noch problemen, dêr wurkje se oan.
But those are problems for another day.	Mar dat binne problemen foar in oare dei.
This is a beautiful place.	Dit is in moai plak.
I look at them both	Ik sjoch se beide oan
When we're there, just look around you.	As wy der binne, sjoch mar om dy hinne.
I'm too tired to read through.	Ik bin te wurch om troch te lêzen.
I can make it myself at home	Ik kin it sels thús meitsje
I have some life in me.	Ik haw wat libben yn my.
He just wanted it to happen.	Hy woe net dat dit barre soe.
I did not think they would talk about my name.	Ik tocht net dat se oer myn namme prate soene.
They can be anyone.	Se kinne elkenien wêze.
If it had been nice.	As it moai west hie.
I wondered if she saw my father	Ik frege my ôf oft se myn heit seach
But there's nothing left for you here.	Mar hjir is neat mear foar dy oer.
They would do what he asked.	Se soene dwaan wat er frege.
But they just did something wrong.	Mar se diene gewoan wat ferkeard.
They've seen you.	Se hawwe jo sjoen.
They may not have.	Se hawwe miskien net.
I'm the only one who can do this.	Ik bin de iennichste dy't dit kin.
It will not be the same tomorrow.	It sil moarn net itselde wêze.
I wondered what had happened	Ik frege my ôf wat der bard wie
There will be nothing to eat.	Der sil neat te iten wêze.
And maybe it was, but a little.	En miskien wie it, mar in bytsje.
He did not hesitate.	Hy hoegde net.
But it never even occurred to me.	Mar it seach my noait iens oan.
My friends.	Myn freonen.
I knew you were with me every day	Ik wist dat jo alle dagen by my wiene
I could have been out too long before	Ik koe earder te lang út wêze
Take one and give it a go.	Nim ien en jou se rûn.
I did not know you were interested in the child	Ik wist net dat jo ynteressearre wiene yn it bern
He heard nothing.	Hy hat neat heard.
I have the evening off	Ik ha de jûn frij
I could not before.	Ik koe net earder.
She told the children not to tell anyone she was there.	Se fertelde de bern om gjinien te fertellen dat se der wie.
But then, that does not say much.	Mar dan, dat seit net folle.
Only this time it is for good.	Allinnich dizze kear is it foar goed.
I do not think you will not find a hair here.	Ik tink net dat jo hjir in hier net fine sille.
I assume no one wants that	Ik nim oan dat nimmen dat wol
I'm told you might be able to help	Ik wurdt ferteld dat jo miskien helpe kinne
You get it, he said.	Jo krije it, sei er.
You are free to do so.	Jo binne frij frij om dat te dwaan.
It needs me.	It moat my.
My best friend.	Myn bêste freon.
I still have to talk to her.	Ik moat noch mei har prate.
We'll see how it goes.	Wy sille sjen hoe't it giet.
I really could not tell her much	Ik koe har echt net folle fertelle
It's a lot for one man.	It is in protte foar ien man.
I wanted him to be with me	Ik woe him by my wêze
That's a big day for us.	Dat is in grutte dei foar ús.
I just wondered who his mother was	Ik frege my mar ôf wa't syn mem wie
They will not be.	Se sille net wêze.
I would not do anything with them anymore	Ik soe net mear mei har meitsje
I can not think.	Ik kin net tinke.
I just need some more time	Ik haw gewoan wat mear tiid nedich
But he's not here, so we can talk about it.	Mar hy is hjir net, dat wy kinne der oer prate.
I got her job.	Ik haw har wurk krigen.
They do a lot.	Se dogge in protte.
But that does not stop them.	Mar dat hâlde se net troch.
Whatever we do, we have to work hard.	Wat wy ek dogge, wy moatte hurd wurkje.
I'm fine again soon.	Ik bin gau wer goed.
He continued.	Hy bleau troch.
I would have liked to	Ik hie wol wol
I know who they are	Ik wit hokker se binne
I was wondering if you want that	Ik frege my ôf oft jo dat wolle
He said he could not.	Hy sei dat er net koe.
I live clearly across the city	Ik wenje dúdlik oer de stêd
She is a whole person.	Se is in hiel persoan.
I got sick of it.	Ik waard der siik fan.
I heard what happened	Ik hearde wat der bard is
It could be anyone.	It koe elkenien wêze.
Or, bart so soon.	Of, bart sa gau.
I see them here all the time	Ik sjoch se hjir de hiele tiid
I wanted to know more	Ik woe mear witte
It's a movie.	It is in film.
Not a very good one at that.	Net in hiel goede ien op dat.
I love all three of them	Ik hâld fan har alle trije
I think he is too.	Ik tink dat hy ek is.
I was not even scared	Ik waard net iens bang
I thought it was him	Ik tocht dat it him wie
So it is in that city.	Sa is it yn dy stêd.
No one had more.	Gjinien hie mear.
You may like it for tonight.	Jo kinne it leuk fine foar fannacht.
I also do not want to wait.	Ik wol ek net wachtsje.
The two have not spoken for a few years.	De twa prate in pear jier net.
Things that are good for the city.	Dingen dy't goed binne foar de stêd.
I do not know exactly what she is doing.	Ik wit net krekt wat se docht.
I'm sure he's fine	Ik bin der wis fan dat hy goed is
That's not what this is about.	Dêr giet it hjir net om.
I was very beautiful	Ik wie tige moai
He had done this often.	Hy hie dit faak dien.
He knows that much.	Hy wit dat folle.
I see how they do the same thing	Ik sjoch hoe't se itselde dogge
I'm most happy with this you have found.	Ik bin it bêste bliid mei dit dat jo hawwe fûn.
I'm sure it's nothing	Ik bin der wis fan dat it neat is
I'm glad it's coming.	Ik bin bliid hoe't it komt.
It was a family thing.	It wie in famylje ding.
It's so good to see.	It is sa goed om te sjen.
I work on that every day now.	Dêr wurkje ik no alle dagen oan.
He thought he knew the way.	Hy tocht dat er de wei wist.
And probably liked what he had seen.	En wierskynlik leuk wat er sjoen hie.
I was not asked to go	Ik waard net frege om te gean
There's just no other way to say it.	D'r is gewoan gjin oare manier om it te sizzen.
Let's be really good at who we are.	Litte wy echt goed wêze yn wa't wy binne.
But we know.	Mar wy witte.
I should not have taken it	Ik hie it net nimme moatten
I did not tell her otherwise.	Ik sei har net oars.
She makes it so easy to see.	Se makket it sa maklik te sjen.
I knew it could only be one thing	Ik wist dat it mar ien ding wêze koe
I did too much	Ik die te folle
It's not the first time this has happened.	It is net de earste kear dat it bart.
I want to stay clear	Ik wol dúdlik bliuwe
I was still trying to help	Ik besocht noch te helpen
Room with another teacher.	Keamer mei in oare learaar.
In this house with this family of mine.	Yn dit hûs mei dizze famylje fan my.
For me, it still does.	Foar my docht it noch.
You can do that though.	Jo kinne dat wol dwaan.
It looks a lot like him.	It liket in protte op him.
She did not have many people anymore.	Se hie net folle minsken mear.
I did not need anyone	Ik hie gjinien nedich
I know how this happened	Ik wit hoe't dit barde
I felt very, very bad.	Ik fielde my heul, heul min.
Where to go.	Wêr te gean.
He had a lot of time.	Hy hie in protte tiid.
Probably it was too late now.	Wierskynlik wie it no te let.
I love her more than life	Ik hâld mear fan har as it libben
Give me a day.	Jou my in dei.
I really needed a plan	Ik hie echt in plan nedich
I could not believe he had actually hit me	Ik koe net leauwe dat hy my eins rekke hie
That was the only way to say it.	Dat wie de ienige manier om it te sizzen.
I just wanted you to know a few things about it.	Ik woe gewoan dat jo der in pear dingen oer witte.
He could not stop.	Hy koe net ophâlde.
I knew the time was up	Ik wist de tiid wie op
I need someone to see it all	Ik haw ien nedich om dat alles te sjen
I did not look so good.	Ik seach net sa goed.
I heard from him yesterday	Ik hearde juster fan him
I wondered what kind of life they had	Ik frege my ôf wat foar libben se hiene
The teacher said he would not do it.	De learaar sei dat er it net dwaan soe.
Please donate today !.	Jou asjebleaft hjoed!.
I wanted to eat more of it.	Ik woe der mear fan ite.
I'm still thinking about it	Ik tink der noch oer nei
I'm In The Office.	Ik bin Op kantoar.
I know what happened.	Ik wit wat der bard is.
I went to bed.	Ik gie op bêd.
I was afraid to take it	Ik wie bang om it te nimmen
I do not want to be his wife	Ik wol net syn frou wêze
I have not seen that movie	Ik haw dy film net sjoen
For everything else, water.	Foar al it oare, wetter.
A lot of people were here last night.	In protte minsken wiene hjir fannacht.
I did not know your mother would come to us	Ik wist net dat jo mem by ús komme soe
He could not go to her.	Hy koe net nei har ta.
Who would you like to talk to? 	Tsjin wa soene jo prate wolle?
But there is no one to help me.	Mar der is gjinien om my te helpen.
asked the man.	frege de man.
I was the last chance	Ik wie de lêste kâns
He also thought it might be fun.	Hy tocht ek dat it wol leuk wurde koe.
I'm sure we will.	Ik bin der wis fan dat wy sille.
I can take care of you	Ik kin foar jo soargje
I'm the only one who can help her right now	Ik bin de iennichste dy't har no helpe kin
That's where we come in.	Dêr komme wy yn.
I really have no idea.	Ik haw echt gjin idee.
I was completely alone	Ik wie hielendal allinnich
It was once a year.	It wie ien kear yn it jier.
I had to go back home	Ik moast werom nei hûs
What are two of my favorite things ever.	Wat binne twa fan myn favorite dingen ea.
I want you to come and help me.	Ik wol dat jo komme en my helpe.
And we still have that today.	En dat hawwe wy hjoed noch.
Whoever does, go away.	Wa't dat docht, gean fuort.
But she will not return.	Mar se sil net werom.
I want to see you so much	Ik wol dy sa graach sjen
I would be happy for her	Ik soe bliid wêze foar har
They were also there to make money.	Se wiene der ek yn om jild te meitsjen.
It was so different from what he had done before.	It wie sa oars as wat er earder dien hie.
I would have seen her	Ik soe har sjoen hawwe
I was a little late, but not much	Ik wie in bytsje let, mar net folle
I never wanted this house	Ik woe dit hûs noait
'on'.	'oan'.
He waited three days.	Trije dagen wachte er.
I think he likes you	Ik tink dat hy jo graach hat
I'm free.	Ik bin frij.
Leave them entirely to me.	Lit se hielendal oan my oer.
I'll look into it.	Ik sil der nei sjen.
I should have asked you if it was okay	Ik hie dy freegje moatten oft it goed wie
That, of course, was the problem.	Dat wie fansels it probleem.
I'm happy with it so far	Ik bin der oant no ta bliid mei
I never talk to her.	Ik praat noait mei har.
She said well.	Se sei goed.
I tried to figure it out	Ik besocht it út te finen
We have to wait, but there is enough time.	Wy moatte wachtsje, mar der is tiid genôch.
She said no one was home.	Se sei dat der gjinien thús wie.
He did not look well.	Hy seach der net goed út.
Go back to bed.	Gean werom op bêd.
I once had so many	Ik hie ien kear safolle
I was expecting you	Ik haw dy ferwachte
I do not feel at all.	Ik fiel my net hielendal.
I wondered if my mother was sitting there under her	Ik frege my ôf oft myn mem dêr ûnder har siet
We would just talk.	Wy soene gewoan prate.
I think it was three	Ik tink dat it trije wie
I knew she was tired of it, and of me	Ik wist dat se der wurch fan wie, en fan my
No one would ever want it.	Nimmen soe it ea wolle.
I know that pretty well	Dat wit ik moai
It had not been difficult.	It hie net dreech west.
I think that would work	Ik tink dat soe wurkje
That in itself is not enough.	Op himsels is dat net genôch.
We do what we want.	Wy dogge wat wy wolle.
There weren’t that many either, but it was something.	Der wiene ek net safolle, mar it wie wat.
I love you with me	Ik hâld fan dy by my
Sit and wait for what would happen.	Sit en wachtsje op wat der barre soe.
It hurts, but you're not him.	It docht sear, mar do bist hy net.
Hold on.	Hâld der oan.
We can not do what we want.	Wy kinne net dwaan wat wy wolle.
I told you one day at a time	Ik sei dy ien dei op in tiid
I do not know what it was like	Ik wit net hoe't it wie
Do what you want.	Doch wat jo wolle.
I want to be needed by you	Ik wol troch dy nedich wêze
I could do this place a lot of good	Ik koe dit plak in protte goed dwaan
I have not seen him since tomorrow	Ik haw him sûnt moarn net sjoen
In one year.	Yn ien jier.
I did not get it this time.	Ik krige it dizze kear net.
Just trying to help.	Krekt besykje te helpen.
I'm afraid even that will not be enough	Ik bin bang dat sels dat net genôch sil wêze
It was not much of a job, really.	It wie net folle fan in baan, echt.
If we want to win it, we can play anyone.	As wy it winne wolle, kinne wy ​​elkenien spylje.
Maybe it was the same.	Miskien wie it deselde.
I should have had a job	Ik hie in baan hawwe moatten
I do not even have a house.	Ik haw net iens in hûs.
I'm not going back to jail	Ik gean net werom nei de finzenis
I feel tired.	Ik fiel my wurch.
Here we'll talk about it.	Hjir sille wy it oer hawwe.
He always said that.	Dat sei er altyd.
But see what happens.	Mar sjoch wat der bart.
Love you too.	Hâld ek fan dy.
You get what you pay for, but many are pretty good.	Jo krije wat jo betelje foar, mar in protte binne frij goed.
And they are too many to go by.	En se binne te folle om mei te gean.
I also looked at the door.	Ik seach ek nei de doar.
But there is one thing you can do.	Mar d'r is ien ding dat jo kinne dwaan.
It went on.	It gie troch.
I did not even look at her.	Ik seach net iens nei har.
I could have more work for her pretty soon	Ik koe frij gau mear wurk foar har hawwe
I knew he was sick and needed help	Ik wist dat hy siik wie en help nedich hie
Tell her enough is enough.	Fertel har genôch is genôch.
And no one went.	En gjinien gie net.
I started to worry	Ik begûn te soargen
The people will not see you.	De minsken sille dy net sjen.
Even then, she would not walk out the door at first.	Sels dan soe se earst net de doar út.
I do not know what else to say.	Ik wit net wat ik oars moat sizze.
I should have thought of that earlier	Dêr hie ik no al earder oan tinke moatten
I did not know what to do for her	Ik wist net wat ik foar har dwaan moast
I have not even asked him yet	Ik ha him noch net iens frege
I have to do this myself	Ik moat dit sels dwaan
I want you to take this and keep it to me.	Ik wol dat jo dit nimme en it foar my hâlde.
But this can be the best of all	Mar dit kin de bêste fan allegear wurde
And no reason to be afraid of these people.	En gjin reden om bang te wêzen foar dizze minsken.
It's who they are.	It is wa't se binne.
I need my people in my life	Ik haw myn minsken nedich yn myn libben
I really can not say much more than that	Ik kin echt net folle mear sizze as dat
I thought she was really tough	Ik tocht dat se wie echt dreech
I asked him who he was talking about	Ik frege him oer wa't er it hie
But this is not what happened.	Mar dit is net wat der bard is.
Maybe not much, but.	Miskien net folle, mar.
This could be you.	Dit kin jo wêze.
They do not always go together.	Se geane net altyd tegearre.
Or someone like it.	Of ien like it.
You should be happy about that.	Dêr moatte jo bliid om wêze.
Nothing would happen.	Der soe neat barre.
This time is different.	Dizze kear is oars.
I had to do something to prevent this	Ik hie wat dwaan moatten om dit foar te kommen
We are probably both.	Wy binne wierskynlik beide.
I think you're trying to scare me	Ik tink dat jo besykje my bang te meitsjen
I'm sorry.	Dat spyt my.
No more is needed.	Mear is net nedich.
I want to make that clear	Ik wol dat dúdlik meitsje
I know a lot of things	Ik wit in protte dingen
How not to be afraid.	Hoe net bang te wêzen.
I can not believe we can do nothing about it	Ik kin it net leauwe dat wy der neat oan dwaan kinne
Someone else will.	Immen oars sil.
I might actually get angry at her	Ik kin eins wol lilk wurde op har
I can not have you like that	Ik kin dy net sa hawwe
I could try.	Ik koe besykje.
I needed to know how it was with him	Ik moast witte hoe't it mei him wie
I could not stay that way long	Ik koe net lang by dy wei bliuwe
Everything had gone well with him.	Alles wie goed gien mei him.
I know exactly what he's doing	Ik wit krekt wat er docht
I have a wife and some children.	Ik haw in frou en wat bern.
I need you to be you	Ik haw jo nedich om jo te wêzen
I know him.	Ik ken him.
He lived at home for a few months.	In pear moanne wenne er thús.
Well, she's just worried about you.	No, se is gewoan soargen oer jo.
Not sure what that will be.	Net wis wat dat sil wêze.
I can not wait to see what happens	Ik kin net wachtsje om te sjen wat der bart
I was very scared of him.	Ik wie tige bang foar him.
Do not let them look at me and do not even look at me.	Lit se net nei my sjen en sjoch net sels nei my.
We met and walked together often.	Wy hawwe moete en rûn tegearre faak.
If you do not have them.	As jo ​​se net hawwe.
I would love to give, give, give.	Ik soe graach jaan, jaan, jaan.
He never has a word for words.	Hy hat noait gjin wurd foar wurden.
I want to do it myself	Ik wol it sels dwaan
And you do not want to do that.	En dat wolle jo net dwaan.
I never gave you a chance	Ik haw dy nea in kâns jûn
A good job well done	In goed wurk goed dien
I thought about it.	Ik haw der oan tocht.
Wait and wait.	Wachtsje en wachtsje.
I have to go from today	Ik moat fan hjoed ôf gean
You have to do something for me.	Jo moatte wat foar my dwaan.
For a bad day.	Foar in minne dei.
Must be easy.	Moat maklik wêze.
Which did a lot.	Wat in protte diene.
We have never done anything else but take care of you.	Wy hawwe noait oars dien, mar foar jo soargje.
I was just a boy.	Ik wie mar in jonge.
But a girl like that should not come here.	Mar in famke as dy moat hjir net komme.
I told him what was going on	Ik fertelde him wat der bart
I'm trying to see.	Ik besykje te sjen.
But so far we have not heard or seen any of them.	Mar oant no ta hawwe wy noch gjin ien fan har heard of sjoen.
We do not need you then.	Wy hawwe dy dan net nedich.
No problems there.	Gjin problemen dêr.
Yes, if need be.	Jo, as it moat.
I wanted her to stay with me.	Ik woe dat se by my bleau.
No reason he should know.	Gjin reden soe er witte moatte.
They always have and always will.	Se hawwe altyd en sille altyd.
I'm done talking.	Ik bin klear mei praten.
I was angry at him now too	Ik wie no ek lilk op him
They hit it again.	Se rekke it wer.
He was a good kid.	Hy wie in goed bern.
This is a problem.	Dit is in probleem.
All this can be so.	Dit alles kin sa wêze.
A few here and a few there	In pear hjir en in pear dêr
I did something today	Ik die hjoed wat
I asked if he had time to talk	Ik frege oft er tiid hie om te praten
And asked me to find her.	En frege my om har te finen.
Whatever it was, it must have been bad.	Wat it ek wie, it moat min west hawwe.
He is not our kind.	Hy is net ús soarte.
But nothing happens.	Mar der bart neat.
I did not think she would do that	Ik tocht net dat se dat dwaan soe
For many people, this would have been it.	Foar in protte minsken soe dit it west hawwe.
I want to know what she wants	Ik wol witte wat se wol
I will do nothing to hurt any of you	Ik sil neat dwaan om ien fan dy sear te dwaan
He did not make it out.	Hy makke it net út.
I'm coming another time.	Ik kom in oare kear.
I want you there next time you visit.	Ik wol jo dêr de folgjende kear as jo besykje.
I would have no idea what I would say to him	Ik soe gjin idee hawwe wat ik tsjin him sizze soe
The first has to do with what it can do for us.	De earste hat te krijen mei wat it foar ús kin dwaan.
If that's true then it's about time.	As dat wier is dan komt it op 'e tiid.
How he had been there for her.	Hoe't er der foar har west hie.
I was so tired of this.	Ik wie hjir sa wurch fan.
More than anything he wanted to help.	Mear as alles woe hy helpe.
It did not matter that they would still be together.	It makke net út dat se noch tegearre wêze soene.
I did not expect him to say that	Ik hie net ferwachte dat er dat soe sizze
Quite simply, get it and see it.	Hiel gewoan, krije it en sjoch it.
But no one had seen her.	Mar nimmen hie har sjoen.
Somehow, he knew.	Op ien of oare manier, wist er.
They show me it themselves.	Se litte my it sels sjen.
I still remember clearly that I did	Ik wit noch dúdlik dat ik dat dien hat
He showed me that it can be done.	Hy liet my sjen dat it dien wurde kin.
I was hurt and angry.	Ik wie sear en lilk.
I almost wanted her	Ik woe har hast wol
I love it was a family home	Ik hâld fan it wie in famylje thús
I wanted to tell you.	Ik woe it dy sizze.
Just do the best job you can.	Doch gewoan it bêste wurk dat jo kinne dwaan.
Two alone, no more.	Twa allinnich, net mear.
I just want to be.	Ik wol gewoan wêze.
Really needed to go !!!.	Echt nedich om te gean!!!.
I wish him that forever	Dat winskje ik him foar altyd
I think you did not like her	Ik tink dat jo har net leuk hiene
And there was another problem.	En der wie ek noch in probleem.
I could not leave him there	Ik koe him dêr net litte
This time is something else.	Dizze kear is wat oars.
I need to tell you something.	Ik moat dy wat fertelle.
That will be true.	Dat sil wier wêze.
I think that would be almost a year ago now	Ik tink dat dat no hast in jier lyn wêze soe
I also felt tired	Ik fielde my ek wurch
I saw the prison last night	Ik seach de finzenis fannacht
It could be seen by anyone else.	It koe wurde sjoen troch elkenien oars.
I can not believe that	Dat kin ik net leauwe
I was just glad I was done	Ik wie gewoan bliid dat ik dien wie
I've been so old	Ik haw sa âld west
I was never a big fan.	Ik wie nea in grutte fan.
He said you were beautiful too.	Hy sei dat jo ek moai wiene.
I'll be talking about the book again soon	Ik sil it gau wer oer it boek ha
I can not say what she thinks	Ik kin net sizze wat se tinkt
But that was not the end of the letter.	Mar dêr bleau de brief net by.
I was a little surprised	Ik wie in bytsje ferrast
Your father, and now this.	Jo heit, en no dit.
I said nothing	Ik sei neat
I waited for the water	Ik wachte op it wetter
I will definitely be back to this one again.	Ik kom nei alle gedachten wer op dizze werom.
I can see where they are coming from	Ik kin sjen wêr't se wei komme
I love her more than anything	Ik hâld mear fan har dan wat dan ek
As really bad.	As echt min.
Those are things we need to do.	Dat binne dingen dy't wy moatte dwaan.
Now let me tell you something.	No lit ik dy wat fertelle.
I'm sorry, but it's happening.	It spyt my, mar it bart.
But there is a name.	Mar der is in namme.
You have no children.	Jo hawwe gjin bern.
I thought you were my friend	Ik tocht dat jo myn freon wiene
I never had to deal with that.	Dêr hie ik noait mei te krijen.
I see you're already thought of that	Ik sjoch wol, dat jo dêr al oan tocht hawwe
I should never have asked.	Ik hie nea freegje moatten.
It just has been.	It is gewoan west.
I think this is a good idea.	Ik tink dat dit in goed idee is.
Many things we decided long ago.	In protte dingen hawwe wy lang lyn besletten.
I never felt that the latter was a problem	Ik fielde noait dat dat lêste in probleem wie
We are not told why this is so.	Wy wurde net ferteld wêrom't dit sa is.
It can not be otherwise.	It kin net oars.
If that's what you want.	As dat is wat jo wolle.
I have no house	Ik haw gjin hûs
He was never a person to talk much about work.	Hy wie nea in persoan om in protte oer wurk te praten.
I did not expect him to give me anything	Ik hie net ferwachte dat er my wat jaan soe
A lot happened.	Der barde in protte.
This time it was different.	Dizze kear wie it oars.
I would say please	Ik soe sizze asjebleaft
I have no idea where she would go	Ik haw gjin idee wêr't se hinne soe
They were all gone.	Se wiene allegear fuort.
I felt angry myself.	Ik fielde my sels lilk.
Here, go over.	Hjir, gean oer.
I do not believe that anymore	Dat leau ik net mear
Or no talk.	Of gjin praat.
Or try to do.	Of besykje te dwaan.
I love his other kids.	Ik hâld fan syn oare bern.
It would never work.	It soe nea wurkje.
I never could	Dat koe ik noait
A girl is with him.	In famke is by him.
They did not.	Dat diene se net.
I think it can come back	Ik tink dat it werom kin
I thought he was angry at me.	Ik tocht dat er lilk op my wie.
I think this is the best for everyone	Ik tink dat dit it bêste is foar elkenien
I could not get out of there, really	Ik koe der net út komme, echt
I really liked that movie	Ik fûn dy film tige leuk
Since then no one has heard from him.	Sûnt hat gjinien fan him heard.
Not so fast.	Net sa gau.
I kept trying to do something	Ik bleau besykje wat te dwaan
When he's there we'll just go home.	As hy der is geane wy ​​mar nei hûs.
Do not tell everything at once.	Fertel net alles yn ien kear.
I saw and heard things	Ik seach en hearde dingen
he said.	hy sei.
I still have this problem	Ik haw noch altyd dit probleem
I want you to scare him	Ik wol dat jo him bang meitsje
We have to be.	Wy moatte wêze.
This is not likely to happen.	Dit sil nei alle gedachten net barre.
I wish he would say something, everything	Ik winskje dat er wat sizze soe, alles
Loves to talk.	Hâldt fan prate.
This must be done.	Dit moat dien wurde.
He still had a wife.	Hy hie noch in frou.
They need to be there.	Se moatte der wêze.
So she goes to work.	Sa giet se oan it wurk.
I was wondering about her today	Ik frege my hjoed ôf oer har
I will not take any money from you	Ik sil gjin jild fan dy nimme
There really is nothing more to it than that.	D'r is echt net mear oan as dat.
I need to know you're fine	Ik moat witte dat jo goed binne
I think it could be something else	Ik tink dat it wat oars kin
But he probably won't.	Mar hy sil nei alle gedachten net.
They do what they do.	Se dogge wat se dogge.
I can do anything here	Ik kin hjir alles dwaan
I think hope is not enough	Ik tink dat hope net genôch is
No one had ever.	Nimmen hie oait.
You're there.	Do bist dêr.
I look at him and agree	Ik sjoch him oan en iens
I know them both.	Ik ken se beide.
I thought about something else	Ik tocht oer wat oars
It makes him better.	It makket him better.
I could take care of that	Dy koe ik wol soargje
I have done my job.	Ik haw myn wurk dien.
She did not even want to be friends with him.	Se woe net iens freonen mei him wêze.
They pretend they like you.	Se dogge oft se dy leuk fine.
I want the truth to be told.	Ik wol dat de wierheid ferteld wurdt.
I think you should leave now	Ik tink dat jo no fuort moatte
I think about things	Ik tink oer dingen
It would not hurt him.	It soe him gjin sear dwaan.
This is a good reason to leave.	Dit is in goede reden om fuort te gean.
She stayed exactly where she was.	Se bleau krekt wêr't se wie.
I never thought it was like that	Ik hie noait tocht dat it sa wie
Well, do not worry.	No, meitsje jo gjin soargen.
That happens every hour on the hour.	Dat bart alle oeren op it oere.
I had no idea what he was saying	Ik hie gjin idee wat er sein hie
And that's right.	En dat is krekt.
That seemed to be himself.	Dat like himsels te wêzen.
I will show you our favorite things here	Ik sil jo hjir ús favorite dingen sjen litte
That's a lot of people.	Dat binne in protte minsken.
I saw her for who she really was	Ik seach har foar wa't se echt wie
I saw them and there are three	Ik seach se en der binne trije
I believe it.	Ik leau it.
Maybe everything, he thought.	Miskien alles, tocht er.
I just did not expect	Ik hie gewoan net ferwachte
Maybe he was just surprised.	Miskien wie er gewoan ferrast.
I just read it.	Ik haw it krekt lêzen.
More than expected.	Mear as ferwachte.
I'm sorry to ever do this.	It spyt my om dit oait te dwaan.
She had seen those words before.	Se hie dy wurden earder sjoen.
If he could go back and tell her.	As er werom gean koe en it har fertelle.
We are here to help !.	Wy binne hjir om te helpen!.
I'm so sorry you're in trouble	It spyt my sa dat jo yn problemen binne
I'm dealing with Dad.	Ik gean mei de heit om.
And there he was.	En dêr wie er.
I dare to be a better self	Ik doar in bettere ik te wêzen
She went on.	Se gie troch.
Do not look back.	Sjoch net werom.
This plan will not work.	Dit plan sil net wurkje.
I look forward to seeing you soon	Ik sjoch der nei út om dy gau te sjen
I always surrender to you	Ik jou my altyd oer oan dy
This meeting is about my wife.	Dizze gearkomste giet oer myn frou.
Talk to no one, and let no one in.	Praat mei gjinien, en lit gjinien yn.
For the sake of the film, of course.	Foar it goede fan de film, fansels.
I had not made it on time	Ik hie it net op tiid makke
I want one.	Ik wol wol ien.
I never want to be that way	Ik wol noait by dy wei wêze
Now's your chance to get it back, and more.	No is jo kâns om it werom te krijen, en mear.
There was not much chance of finding them.	Der wie net folle kâns om se te finen.
I just did not have to think about it.	Ik moast der gewoan net oan tinke.
He asked my name.	Hy frege myn namme.
I will not tell you his name	Ik sil dy syn namme net fertelle
There could be anything.	Der koe fan alles wêze.
So you get more than you pay for.	Sa krije jo mear as jo betelje foar.
I know a lot about what people want	Ik wit in protte oer wat minsken wolle
The friend continued to see her.	De freon bleau har te sjen.
Worked well for a few days.	Wurke goed in pear dagen.
Many of us do.	In protte fan ús dogge.
Let's talk about something else.	Lit ús prate oer wat oars.
I bought my new car last year	Ik kocht ferline jier myn nije auto
Bad for us.	Min foar ús.
Well, tell me.	No, fertel my.
I just could not eat it.	Ik koe it gewoan net ite.
And life is the best school.	En it libben is de bêste skoalle.
I did not see him hurt	Ik seach him net sear sjen
I even have no idea where she lives now	Ik ha sels gjin idee wêr't se no wennet
Please, come on.	Asjebleaft, kom op.
And the other now as well.	En de oare no ek.
But there was no bed.	Mar der wie gjin bêd.
As her best friend.	As har bêste freon.
I did not want to keep one	Ik woe net ien hâlde
A few will agree with you	In pear sille it mei dy iens wêze
So much for the tiredness of looking at him.	Sa folle foar it wurch fan it sjen nei him.
I wish he never will	Ik winskje hy nea sil
And it had scared him.	En it hie him bang makke.
I did not want to see it	Ik woe it net sjen
in.	yn.
Will not hold my hand.	Sil myn hân net hâlde.
That was the idea.	Dat wie it idee.
My father is my best friend.	Myn heit is myn bêste freon.
He asked me not to stop.	Hy frege my net op te hâlden.
I could do it myself	Ik koe it sels dwaan
I was good for one thing and only one thing	Ik wie goed foar ien ding en mar ien ding
Come and join us.	Kom en doch mei ús.
You want to see everything.	Jo wolle alles sjen.
And when they do, you have to be careful.	En as se dat dogge moatte jo foarsichtich wêze.
I just think of my kids.	Ik tink gewoan oan myn bern.
But it ate nothing.	Mar it iet neat.
The child is then asked why he is doing this.	It bern wurdt dan frege wêrom't er dit docht.
I need one and it's you we want.	Ik haw ien nedich en it binne jo dy't wy wolle.
Good for you.	Goed foar dy.
But one more.	Mar noch ien.
It seems that the last issue here is the problem.	It liket derop dat it lêste probleem hjir it probleem is.
I had never seen it before	Ik hie it no noch noait earder sjoen
It is not easy to find work.	It is net maklik om wurk te finen.
I visited the door.	Ik besocht de doar.
I have never seen such.	Ik haw nea sjoen sa'n.
We did the work.	Wy diene it wurk.
And then they know about us.	En dan witte se fan ús.
I did not want you to be like that.	Ik woe net dat jo sa wiene.
We have made that very clear.	Dat hawwe wy hiel dúdlik makke.
He did not say much about it.	Hy sei der net folle oer.
I can see why you would worry	Ik kin sjen wêrom't jo soargen soene
I know your father and your mother	Ik ken dyn heit en dyn mem
The letter was from her.	It brief wie fan har.
I was not sure what to do with the boy	Ik wie net wis wat te dwaan mei de jonge
We can not worry about what has happened to us.	Wy kinne ús gjin soargen meitsje oer wat der foar ús bard is.
I hope we had more time	Ik hope dat wy mear tiid hiene
They stop going to school.	Se hâlde op mei nei skoalle.
And it's still better than nothing.	En it is noch altyd better as neat.
In fact, we can do better than that.	Eins kinne wy ​​better dwaan as dat.
She really did not want to do that.	Dat woe se eins net dwaan.
I did not want to see	Ik woe net sjen
You can get out of this.	Jo kinne út dit.
That never happened when my hair was long.	Dat barde noait doe't myn hier lang wie.
They would know someone was here.	Se soene witte dat immen hjir wie.
Together or not.	Tegearre of net.
He knew this was not necessary.	Hy wist dat dit net nedich wie.
It really struck me.	It kaam my echt oan.
I had not done it one day	Ik hie it noch net ien dei dien
Some old and old.	Wat âld en âld.
That was exactly her.	Dat wie se krekt.
I did not know her, or what she was	Ik koe har net, of wat se wie
Food was never an issue there.	Iten wie nea in probleem dêr.
She comes and sits with me.	Se komt en sit by my.
It's the first thing they ask.	It is it earste wat se freegje.
I opened the door and there was no one there	Ik die de doar iepen en dêr wie gjinien
I can not think about it anymore	Ik kin der net mear oer tinke
They could see nothing.	Se koene neat sjen.
Give one day here, take one day there.	Jou hjir ien dei, nim dêr ien dei.
Well, not much.	No, net folle.
This was not enough.	Dit wie net genôch.
Tell him you need it back.	Fertel him dat jo it werom nedich hawwe.
And that would come upon me.	En dat soe op my komme.
She's coming to a town near you.	Se komt nei in stêd by dy.
It did not work.	It wurke net.
Anyone interested in going ?.	Immen ynteressearre yn gean?.
I had to say something	Ik moast wat sizze
I will try this next time	Ik sil besykje dit folgjende kear
An old.	In âld.
I think they are on me	Ik tink dat se op my binne
This is under him.	Dit is ûnder him.
I would do it again and again	Ik soe it wer en wer dwaan
I can not believe it's three years ago	Ik kin net leauwe dat it trije jier lyn is
You can do the same with your dog.	Jo kinne itselde dwaan mei jo hûn.
I see it happening.	Ik sjoch it wol barre.
Even if it's just a little bit.	Al is it mar in bytsje.
He would not take it.	Hy soe it net nimme.
I've always been that way	Ik haw altyd sa west
I could not see him.	Ik koe him net sjen.
It was happy.	It wie bliid.
I think we can help you	Ik tink dat wy jo kinne helpe
I've seen enough.	Ik haw genôch sjoen.
I myself never had a chance	Ik hie sels noait in kâns
I'm coming up here to be with you	Ik kom hjir op om by dy te wêzen
I can not give you everything	Ik kin dy net alles jaan
She would do it.	Se soe it dwaan.
But she could not find it.	Mar se koe it net fine.
Not for us.	Net foar ús.
I got along really well with her.	Ik krige it echt goed mei har.
I can not leave you this	Ik kin dy dit net litte
You are in or out.	Jo binne of yn.
I had something else	Ik hie wat oars
I'll wait for you if that's what you want	Ik sil op dy wachtsje as dat is wat jo wolle
Next year maybe.	Takom jier miskien.
I have not for a long time	Ik al lang net
See, this is the thing.	Sjoch, dit is it ding.
I'm trying to make that right now.	Ik besykje dat no goed te meitsjen.
Also have a lake.	Hawwe ek in mar.
I have only seen one dog	Ik haw mar ien hûn sjoen
I'm planning to be at that party	Ik bin fan plan op dat feest te wêzen
But think about this.	Mar tink oer dit.
I knew about it.	Ik wist der fan.
It's where he was, and where she needed to be.	It is wêr't hy wie, en wêr't se ek wêze moast.
I would not want it to be another person	Ik soe net wolle dat it in oare persoan wie
I would show you a picture.	Ik soe dy in foto sjen litte.
I thought we were going to be a family	Ik tocht dat wy in famylje wêze soene
I have children there.	Ik haw dêr bern.
Really, we can.	Echt, wy kinne.
But you're coming back.	Mar jo komme werom.
I think she has not gone to bed yet	Ik tink dat se noch net op bêd gien is
They so want you to be happy.	Se wolle sa graach dat jo bliid wêze.
It was impossible to drive.	It wie net te riden.
We will not stay here again.	Wy sille net bliuwe hjir wer.
It would not really help him to look here.	It soe him eins net helpe om hjir te sjen.
They had work to do.	Se hiene wurk te dwaan.
There is something wrong with all this.	Der is wat net goed oer dit alles.
He is something more.	Hy is wat mear.
She is who she is and he is who he is.	Se is wa't se is en hy is wa't hy is.
Help me here.	Help my hjir.
He was so nice.	Hy wie sa aardich.
I did not have to be happy about it	Ik hoegde der net bliid fan te wêzen
His wife knew it too.	Syn frou wist it ek.
It was not easy for me.	It wie net maklik foar my.
But that never happened.	Mar dat is noait bard.
It's easy and it's fun.	It is maklik en it is leuk.
I do not want the money	Ik wol it jild net
If you had problems, they would talk to you.	As jo ​​​​problemen hiene, soene se mei jo prate.
He wants us to hurt each other.	Hy wol dat wy elkoar sear meitsje.
It happens to me, now.	It bart my, no.
It does not matter where you are.	It makket neat út wêr't jo binne.
I can not spend much time	Ik kin net folle tiid
I think she would have done that.	Ik tink dat se dat dien hawwe soe.
He could not have.	Hy koe net hawwe.
I have decided to adopt her	Ik haw besletten har oan te nimmen
They agreed with each other.	Se wiene it mei elkoar iens.
I had to try something	Ik moast wat besykje
And he looked.	En hy seach.
I did not tell him this time	Ik fertelde him dizze kear net
I had to get out of that room.	Ik moast út dy keamer.
I just knew she would be there	Ik wist gewoan dat se der wêze soe
I would not give that to my children	Dat soe ik myn bern net jaan
But for something else.	Mar foar wat oars.
I was more worried about what he had said about reading	Ik wie mear soargen oer wat hy hie sein oer it lêzen
I was rather wrong.	Ik wie earder ferkeard.
I hope you enjoyed it	Ik hoopje dat jo it goed hawwe hâlden
You just can not have the time to go through everything there.	Jo kinne gewoan net de tiid hawwe om alles dêr troch te gean.
But how, we said.	Mar hoe, seine wy.
I assume he knows what he's doing	Ik nim oan dat er wit wat er docht
She does not have to touch us.	Se hoege ús net oan te gean.
I had to see him again	Ik moast him wer sjen
I just do not know how you think enough to say.	Ik wit gewoan net hoe't jo genôch tinke om te sizzen.
I can not show this.	Ik kin dit net sjen litte.
I'll get them first	Ik sil se earst krije
I always thought you would come back	Ik tocht altyd dat jo werom soene
I used to be.	Ik wie eartiids.
I can not do without them	Ik kin net sûnder har
I totally agree with him here	Ik bin it hjir hielendal mei him iens
I knew it would be my place.	Ik wist dat it myn plak wêze soe.
I would think it would not be easy	Ik soe tinke dat it net maklik wêze soe
That will not be necessary.	Dat sil net nedich wêze.
One such person was her father.	Ien sa'n persoan wie har heit.
I was not so sure anymore	Ik wie der net mear sa wis fan
But she could do both.	Mar se koe beide.
Now she knew that would not happen.	No wist se dat dat net barre soe.
Best time of year.	Bêste tiid fan it jier.
This is not entirely true.	Dit is net hielendal wier.
Of course we agree.	Wy binne it fansels iens.
I never want to stop looking at him	Ik wol noait ophâlde nei him te sjen
Of course you are beautiful.	Fansels bist moai.
I could no longer doubt it.	Ik koe der net mear oan twifelje.
I know how to do this	Ik wit hoe't ik dit moat
I'm happy with today	Ik bin bliid mei hjoed
She looked hard.	Se seach hurd.
I really wonder how true that is.	Ik freegje my echt ôf hoe wier dat is.
It's just.	It is gewoan.
We are not saying they would do that, of course.	Wy sizze net dat se dat soene dwaan, fansels.
I could not try to get away	Ik koe net besykje fuort te kommen
You have to find the way yourself.	Jo moatte sels de wei fine.
I hope you knew it was not me	Ik hope dat jo wisten dat it net ik wie
I did not have much of it	Ik haw der net in protte fan hân
I wondered what she had bought.	Ik frege my ôf wat se kocht hie.
He never talked about it.	Hy hat der noait oer praat.
I can just be her friend	Ik kin gewoan har freon wêze
If you do not have it, you do not have it.	As jo ​​​​it net hawwe, hawwe jo it net.
We say nothing.	Wy sizze neat.
But we know they can not.	Mar wy witte dat se net kinne.
It felt real, but it could not.	It fielde echt, mar it koe net.
He is very happy with it.	Hy is der tige bliid mei.
I may not be able to get you back	Ik kin dy miskien net werom krije
On its own, that was reason enough for me to get involved.	Op himsels wie dat foar my reden genôch om mei te dwaan.
I can make this work	Ik kin dit wurk meitsje
I let them know.	Ik lit se witte.
But not in a good way.	Mar net op in goede manier.
I did not open the door.	Ik die de doar net iepen.
There was no more work to do.	Der wie gjin wurk mear te dwaan.
You did this to us.	Jo hawwe dit oan ús dien.
It was time to do it again.	It wie tiid om it wer te dwaan.
On other days.	Op oare dagen.
I knew there was something sitting over you	Ik wist dat der wat oer dy sit wie
That is not to say that everyone did not know it.	Dat wol net sizze dat elkenien it net wist.
I think we can all agree on that	Ik tink dat wy it der allegear oer iens wêze kinne
These were really really good.	Dizze wiene echt echt goed.
She had done it.	Se hie it dien.
I was too busy to look around	Ik wie te drok om om my hinne te sjen
I'm glad I have you.	Ik bin bliid dat ik dy ha.
He said he could not believe it.	Hy sei dat er it net leauwe koe.
I think this boy will be good for you	Ik tink dat dizze jonge goed foar dy wêze sil
We get him back.	Wy krije him werom.
We had a little money.	Wy hiene in bytsje jild.
Let's see here.	Litte wy hjir sjen.
There were people here too.	Der wiene hjir ek minsken.
I have one more question.	Ik haw noch ien fraach.
To do the right thing.	Om it goede ding te dwaan.
I know, there are many.	Ik wit, der binne in protte.
I have been waiting my whole life for this day	Ik haw myn hiele libben op dizze dei wachte
It's a job, it's just a job.	It is in baan, it is gewoan in baan.
I know what he knows	Ik wit wat hy wit
That's all right.	Dat is hielendal goed.
But they never do.	Mar se dogge it noait.
I met his parents for the first time	Ik moete syn âlden foar de earste kear
You clearly do not know this.	Jo witte dit dúdlik net.
A little worried, maybe	In bytsje soargen, miskien
She said she would take me there.	Se sei se soe nimme my dêr.
I knew all about it	Dêr wist ik alles fan
And the idea comes to me.	En it idee komt by my.
But we do not want that.	Mar dat wolle wy net.
But then again, a few people had.	Mar dan wer, in pear minsken hiene.
I'm making something to eat	Ik meitsje wat te iten
I could not return from there either	Dêr koe ik ek net fan werom
I could not believe what was happening	Ik koe net leauwe wat der bart
It was not from him.	It wie net fan him.
It's really work.	It is echt wurk.
I always had a better way of getting things done	Ik hie altyd in bettere manier om dingen dien te krijen
I myself get tired	Ik sels wurd wurch
I was afraid he would not come	Ik wie bang dat er net komme soe
Well, it was nothing to her.	No, it wie har neat.
I need to do some things	Ik moat wat dingen dwaan
If you have any questions, please ask.	As jo ​​​​fragen hawwe, freegje jo asjebleaft.
They did not have to worry.	Se hiene gjin soargen moatten.
A day or two old.	In dei as twa âld.
I know them too well	Ik ken se te goed
I'm so into nothing	Ik bin sa op neat
Why? 	Wêrom?
I had no chance to take any of them out	Ik hie gjin kâns om ien fan har út te nimmen
he asked his friend.	frege er syn freon.
And then very well.	En dan hiel goed.
I can not see that there is a problem	Ik kin net sjen dat der in probleem is
Mine has never worked.	Myn hat nea wurke.
I should be there now	Ik soe der no wêze moatte
I think he went there	Ik tink dat hy dêr hinne gie
Ask for help, even if you have before.	Freegje om help, sels as jo earder hawwe.
Just do what works for you.	Doch gewoan wat foar jo wurket.
I could be so	Ik soe sa wêze kinne
I have no idea where it came from	Ik haw gjin idee wêr't it kaam
They don't talk anymore.	Se prate net mear.
But do not think so.	Mar tink net sa.
I have decided	Ik haw my besletten
But when he did, he was all in on it.	Mar doe't er dat die, wie er alles yn.
I can see no reason why he should not.	Ik kin gjin reden sjen wêrom't er dat net soe.
But it would be wrong for me.	Mar it soe ferkeard wêze foar my.
I did not return	Ik hoegde net werom
I could see he was not well for a long time	Ik koe sjen dat er noch lang net goed wie
I need another one.	Ik moat der noch ien by.
Of course, two people can do more things than one.	Fansels kinne twa minsken mear dingen dwaan as ien.
I look forward to coming back again next year	Ik sjoch der nei út om takom jier wer werom te kommen
I will not do that here.	Dat sil ik hjir net dwaan.
That I really should not say	Dat moat ik eins net sizze
That's here.	Dat is hjir.
I have to find another way.	Ik moat in oare manier fine.
It really is a beautiful place this.	It is echt in moai plak dit.
That movie they would never make now.	Dy film soene se no noait meitsje.
We have to make it.	Wy moatte it meitsje.
I just told them they were not open	Ik fertelde har gewoan dat se net iepen wiene
I'm not even sure how.	Ik bin der net iens wis fan hoe.
Everyone knows things are bad.	Elkenien wit dat dingen min binne.
But I do not know how to do it.	Mar ik wit net hoe it te dwaan.
I already have it together.	Ik haw it al tegearre.
I think it's his name	Ik tink dat it syn namme is
He was able to leave last night.	Hy koe fannacht fuort.
Think it through friends.	Tink it troch freonen.
I knew what was going on	Ik wist wat der wie
That is obvious.	Dat stiet foar de hân.
I need to know if he's still here	Ik moat witte oft er hjir noch is
I never wanted to hurt him or wanted to	Ik woe him nea sear dwaan of woe
Dad is not afraid of work.	Heit is net bang foar it wurk.
I had not really thought about that	Dêr hie ik eins net oan tocht
I had to see her.	Ik moast har sjen.
I shook his hand	Ik joech him de hân
I see him do this every day	Ik sjoch him dit alle dagen dwaan
I have not seen you for a long time	Ik haw dy lang net sjoen
If there is not enough, everything stops.	As der net genôch is, hâldt alles op.
Will do the things you asked me to do.	Sil de dingen dwaan dy't jo my frege hawwe.
He has the hair.	Hy hat it hier.
Make life good for my wife and children.	Meitsje it libben goed foar myn frou en bern.
He would not eat, even though there was a lot to eat.	Hy soe net ite, al wie der in protte te iten.
Let's find a place.	Litte wy in plak fine.
On the.	Op 'e.
I just had to watch	Ik moast gewoan sjen
It's good that you're interested.	It is wol goed dat jo ynteressearre binne.

You can take some water.	Jo kinne wat wetter nimme.
They are also busy.	Se binne ek drok.
I'm not really sure.	Ik bin der net echt wis fan.
I love everything about him	Ik hâld fan alles oer him
I think she did.	Ik tink dat se it die.
It made me question everything.	It makke my fragen oer alles.
He will know what to do.	Hy sil witte wat te dwaan.
Good? 	Goed?
Let them not do that to you.	Lit se dat net oan dy dwaan.
I think they are wrong.	Ik tink dat se ferkeard binne.
Just for a day.	Krekt foar in dei.
I know you will be fine	Ik wit dat jo goed sille wêze
I assume it would do me good	Ik nim oan dat it my goed dwaan soe
What they can not see is that it was nothing of the sort.	Wat se net sjen kinne is dat it neat fan 'e soarte wie.
I would not do without you	Ik soe net sûnder jo te fertellen
I talk to people.	Ik praat mei minsken.
I think it must be me	Ik tink dat it my wêze moat
People who believe in you and believe in you.	Minsken dy't jo leauwe en yn jo leauwe.
He could no longer bear it.	Hy koe it net mear oan.
We know how they work.	Wy witte hoe't se wurkje.
Money and family.	Jild en famylje.

You need time.	Jo hawwe tiid nedich.
You just do not.	Jo gewoan net.
Made a good life.	In goed libben makke.
These two were friends.	Dizze twa wiene freonen.
I wondered how well that would have worked	Ik frege my ôf hoe goed dat soe hawwe wurke
That nothing would happen.	Dat der neat barre soe.
It would not be life if it were not hard work.	It soe gjin libben wêze as it net hurd wurk wie.
I gave it food and water	Ik joech it iten en wetter
She wants it to work.	Se wol dat it wurket.
There is work to be done.	Der is wurk dat dien wurde moat.
I thought he liked you	Ik tocht dat hy dy leuk hie
I have to come up with a plan or something	Ik moat mei in plan komme of sa
He could not take it anymore.	Hy koe net mear oan.
To and from work.	Nei en fan it wurk.
Which is probably very true.	Wat wierskynlik tige wier is.
That's not the problem.	Dat is net it probleem.
So I wonder why that happens.	Dat ik freegje my ôf wêrom dat bart.
We can not wait to see what you come up with.	Wy kinne net wachtsje om te sjen wat jo komme mei.
If you do not want to, then do not.	As jo ​​​​net wolle, dan net.
They eat everything.	Se ite alles.
I would never see her alive again	Ik soe har nea wer libben sjen
It's not everyone.	It is net elkenien.
She could do nothing.	Se koe neat dwaan.
Take my wife now.	Nim myn frou no.
The truth comes out.	De wierheid komt út.
I did not do any work today	Ik haw hjoed gjin wurk dien
More than you know.	Mear as jo witte.
Someone would talk.	Immen soe prate.
I really think we can have something together	Ik tink echt dat wy tegearre wat hawwe kinne
Better keep him away from her.	Better hâld him fan har ôf.
I think you can go now	Ik tink dat jo no gean kinne
I can see through you	Ik kin troch dy hinne sjen
I will not keep myself.	Ik sil my net hâlde.

He had done what he could.	Hy hie dien wat er koe.
I thought one thing	Ik tocht ien ding
My family was there.	Myn famylje wie der.
Do it only once.	Doch it mar ien kear.
I can not really think	Ik kin net echt tinke
And a lot of people do.	En in protte minsken dogge.
I tell everyone how she did it	Ik fertel elkenien hoe't se it dien hat
I had never seen a time that it was not	Ik hie noch noait in tiid sjoen dat it net wie
I did everything alone	Ik die alles allinnich
I make my family play and they love it	Ik meitsje myn famylje spylje en se graach
He had seen that happen.	Hy hie dat barre sjoen.
But they are asking for help.	Mar se freegje om help.
Maybe we will.	Miskien sille wy.
I had never done that to a woman before	Dat hie ik noch noait in frou dien
I will not leave here	Ik sil hjir net fuort
I had to work hard, let me tell you	Ik moast hurd wurkje, lit ik dy sizze
I hope he has become a better man.	Ik hoopje dat er in better man wurden is.
I have been problem free since	Ik haw sûnt problemen frij west
Net har man.	Net har man.
Whatever you have, give it away.	Wat jo ek hawwe, jou it fuort.
I wish we were friends	Ik woe dat wy freonen wiene
I do not do that anymore	Dat doch ik net mear
And do it one more time.	En doch it noch ien kear.
I had some things with me	Ik hie wat dingen by my
Not for this.	Net foar dizze.
So they can have it.	Sa kinne se it hawwe.
He told her nothing to say about what had happened.	Hy fertelde har neat te sizzen oer wat der bard wie.
Make it a weekend of it.	Meitsje der in wykein fan.
I think back to when we spoke earlier last week	Ik tink werom oan doe't wy earder ferline wike prate
But she was not well.	Mar se wie net goed.
He could take care of that.	Dêr koe er foar soargje.
I was just as happy to be back here.	Ik wie like bliid om hjir werom te kommen.
I should be careful.	Ik soe foarsichtich wêze moatte.
We think it will work.	Wy tinke dat it sil wurkje.
Just give me up.	Jou my net op.
He did not look forward to that.	Dêr seach er net nei út.
Once in three it works like this.	Ien kear yn de trije wurket it sa.
The first week was difficult.	De earste wike wie dreech.
And he does it so beautifully.	En hy docht it sa moai.
But it had come too late.	Mar it wie te let kommen.
I looked over the water	Ik seach oer it wetter
I could not really say how old he was	Ik koe net echt sizze hoe âld hy wie
I also think we should leave tonight	Ik tink ek dat wy fannacht fuort moatte
That had really been the case.	Dat hie echt west.
I felt so sick.	Ik fielde my sa siik.
I can not tell you where we're going	Ik kin jo net sizze wêr't wy hinne geane
There is not much to it.	Der is net folle oan it.
I just expected to be alone again	Ik ferwachte gewoan wer allinnich te wêzen
I like to think only of myself at my best	Ik tink graach allinnich oan my op myn bêste
I may not know it tomorrow	Ik wit it miskien net moarn
I do not know if it is good or not.	Ik wit net oft it goed is of net.
She was a beautiful girl.	Se wie in moai famke.
The man has my things.	De man hat myn dingen.
I only met him once at a friend's house	Ik moete him mar ien kear by in freon syn hûs
I could see what was happening	Ik koe sjen wat der barde
But we will be gone.	Mar wy sille fuort wêze.
I could not see well	Ik koe net goed sjen
I just work hard.	Ik wurkje gewoan hurd.
I just want to go home to see my family	Ik wol gewoan nei hûs om myn famylje te sjen
He saw it too.	Hy seach it ek.
I have read it over and over again	Ik haw it oer en wer lêzen
The little that remained.	It bytsje dat bleau.
It would never be done.	It soe nea dien wurde.
Then, try them out.	Dan, besykje se út.
And soon everyone would know it.	En al gau soe elkenien it witte.
I can see it very well now	Ik kin it no hiel goed sjen
You have to do it when they ask.	Jo moatte it dwaan as se freegje.
I wonder what they will find at his house	Ik freegje my ôf wat se by syn hûs fine sille
He knew she was coming.	Hy wist dat se komme soe.
For once, he could not see his way clearly.	Foar ien kear koe er syn wei net dúdlik sjen.
Really really sick.	Echt echt siik.
Not once, not ever.	Net ien kear, net ea.
I was not the one who did any of these things.	Ik wie net dejinge dy't ien fan dizze dingen die.
He no longer had any idea what he wanted to happen.	Hy hie gjin idee mear wat er barre woe.
I have not given her a name yet	Ik haw har noch gjin namme jûn
He did not look scared.	Hy seach net bang.
Please come soon	Kom asjebleaft gau
But she could never say that to him.	Mar dat koe se nea tsjin him sizze.
You are the person who is always and never there.	Jo binne de persoan dy't der altyd en nea is.
I never said anything about it	Ik ha der noait wat fan sein
But even he has questions.	Mar sels hy hat fragen.
I wanted to help now	Ik woe no helpe
All not well.	Alles net goed.
We have not told them yet.	Wy hawwe se noch net ferteld.
I can be there in an hour	Ik kin der oer in oere wêze
The work was not difficult.	It wurk wie net dreech.
He took money.	Hy naam jild.
I strongly believe that	Dat leau ik tige
But for her, that was enough.	Mar foar har wie dat genôch.
I am very happy to read it	Ik bin heul bliid om it te lêzen
Do you agree or disagree.	Binne jo it iens of net iens.
I never knew what it was.	Ik wist noait wat it wie.
I did not think of it at first	Ik tocht der earst net oan
We need to take you home with us.	Wy moatte jo mei ús nei hûs nimme.
It was not so for us.	It wie foar ús net sa.
But she had a problem.	Mar se hie in probleem.
I love you with all these things you do	Ik hâld fan dy mei al dizze dingen dy't jo dogge
I would not ask	Ik soe net freegje
I should have done it a long time ago.	Ik hie it al lang lyn dwaan moatten.
We just are not.	Wy binne gewoan net.
If true.	As wier.
She was wrong.	Se wie ferkeard.
I think that's true for life	Ik tink dat dat wier is foar it libben
Nothing would have surprised him.	Neat soe him ferrast hawwe.
A day like this.	In dei as dizze.
I just want to be free	Ik wol gewoan frij wêze
Of course not that she would get the chance to say that.	Fansels net dat se de kâns krije soe om dat te sizzen.
I could not, it was too late	Ik koe net, it wie te let
In a way, he had.	Op in manier hie er.
It would all be fine.	It soe allegear goed wêze.
It makes things go easy.	It makket dingen gean maklik.
I wonder if you can help me	Ik freegje my ôf oft jo my helpe kinne
I hope it was a good one	Ik hoopje dat it wie in goede
I put a boy out.	Ik sette in jonge út.
We can still see it.	Wy kinne it noch sjen.
I should not have asked.	Ik hie net freegje moatten.
I know you can do the job	Ik wit dat jo it wurk kinne dwaan
We were sure we would do much better.	Wy wiene der wis fan dat wy soene dwaan folle better.
I did not have to do anything more	Ik hoegde my net mear te dwaan
I put everything off	Ik sette alles ôf
And we're sick of it.	En wy binne der siik fan.
There was nothing to keep.	Der wie neat te hâlden.
Today he was no longer sure of anything.	Hjoed wie er neat mear wis fan.
I want someone to know	Ik wol dat immen it wit
I just need to be ready	Ik moat gewoan klear wêze
She wanted people around her.	Se woe minsken om har hinne.
But it had to be him.	Mar it moast him wêze.
That's how you get there.	Sa komme jo der wis fan.
I needed her here.	Ik hie har hjir nedich.
He did not see me, he did not have it.	Hy seach my net, hy hie it net.
I wanted to show it to you	Ik woe it dy sjen litte
I will always and forever be with you	Ik sil altyd en foar altyd by dy wêze
She did not feel good about entering this room.	Se fielde net goed om dizze keamer yn te gean.
I have no children.	Ik ha gjin bern.
I thought of him last night.	Ik tocht fannacht oan him.
What was fun.	Wat wie leuk.
I can not help you much	Ik kin dy net folle helpe
Sit down, kids.	Sit, bern.
I was too scared of that	Dêr wie ik te bang foar
I want my mom to leave today	Ik wol dat myn mem hjoed fuort giet
About what exactly we do not know.	Oer wat krekt witte wy net.
It's not just me.	It is net allinnich fan my.
This is very easy to do.	Dit is hiel maklik te dwaan.
Now he might have been.	No hie er miskien west.
We can agree.	Wy kinne it iens wêze.
Or maybe it still is.	Of miskien is it noch wol.
Look over them.	Sjoch oer har.
Maybe not everything.	Miskien net alles.
I was pretty happy.	Ik wie aardich bliid.
I can be better careful from here on out	Ik kin better foarsichtich wêze fan hjir ôf
I wanted what they had	Ik woe wat se hiene
She knew what the child was feeling.	Se wist wat it bern fielde.
I think there is water too	Ik tink dat der ek wetter is
They had expected so much.	Se hiene safolle ferwachte.
I knew he needed help	Ik wist dat hy help nedich hie
I have nothing to do today	Ik haw hjoed neat te dwaan
I gave her what she came for and more	Ik joech har wêr't se foar kaam en mear
And they had good reason.	En se hiene goede reden.
I need a word with you too.	Ik moat ek in wurd mei dy.
Can anyone tell me where I'm wrong.	Kin immen my fertelle wêr't ik ferkeard bin.
I could not take it anymore	Ik koe it net mear oan
Quite something real.	Hiel wat echt.
I just wanted to help him	Ik woe him allinnich helpe
The time came to me.	De tiid kaam my oan.
If true, he did not have a car.	As it wier is, hie er gjin auto.
I wonder how much he heard.	Ik freegje my ôf hoefolle hy hearde.
I always have more things to do.	Ik haw altyd mear dingen te dwaan.
I just have to tell you	Ik moat it dy mar fertelle
I've seen it twice now	Ik haw it no twa kear sjoen
It does a few other things.	It docht in pear oare dingen.
I could not say who it was	Ik koe net sizze wa't it wie
I was hoping you would come	Ik hie hope dat jo komme soene
He would be in and out in no time.	Hy soe yn gjin tiid yn en út wêze.
That could be a problem for him.	Dat kin foar him in probleem wêze.
We have to go home.	Wy moatte nei hûs.
That leaves them at home when they go to work.	Dat litte se thús as se nei it wurk gean.
She found it too late.	Se fûn it te let.
He told me he would stop.	Hy fertelde my dat hy ophâlde soe.
If you are not into that, there is no you there.	As jo ​​​​net yn dat binne, is d'r gjin jo dêr.
But my parents.	Mar myn âlden.
I knew she loved things about me	Ik wist dat se dingen fan my hâlde
I have not decided yet	Ik haw noch net besletten
I had no idea what it was about	Ik hie gjin idee wêr't it oer gean koe
He did not even look.	Hy seach net iens.
I want the truth out	Ik wol de wierheid út
He was very happy to read the book	Hy wie tige bliid om it boek te lêzen
I bought some time	Ik kocht wat tiid
I was so hoping that all would be well	Ik wie sa hope dat alles goed soe wêze
No one had a clear idea of ​​what had happened here.	Nimmen hie in dúdlik idee fan wat hjir bard wie.
I give that to my parents	Ik jou dat oan myn âlden
I have to talk first	Ik moat earst prate
I told her about you	Ik fertelde har oer dy
I do not want you to be hurt.	Ik wol net dat jo sear wurde.
I was pretty good at it	Ik wie der aardich goed yn
You probably haven’t heard it all.	Jo hawwe it wierskynlik net allegear heard.
I needed nothing	Ik hie neat nedich
That's what she wanted.	Dat woe se wol.
You would think they would, but they do not.	Jo soene tinke dat se soene, mar se dogge it net.
It was the other.	It wie de oare.
You have done a very good job.	Jo hawwe in hiel goed wurk dien.
I can not get through it again	Ik kin der net wer troch
If it is done well.	As it goed dien is.
I opened it carefully	Ik die it foarsichtich iepen
I'm not sure how long we will stay	Ik bin der net wis fan hoe lang wy bliuwe
He told us that.	Hy fertelde ús dat.
I'll take good care that she never does.	Ik sil goed soargje dat se noait docht.
I would not have given this place any money either	Ik soe dit plak ek gjin jild jûn hawwe
The food is good.	It iten is goed.
We do the same thing to them that they do to us.	Wy dogge itselde ding mei har dat se ús dogge.
And this is difficult.	En dit is dreech.
I looked through all her stuff but never found it	Ik seach al har dingen troch, mar fûn it noait
She wanted to look away, but she could not.	Se woe fuort sjen, mar se koe net.
Almost no one has.	Hast gjinien hat.
And he took me at my word.	En hy naam my op myn wurd.
And do it as soon as you think about it.	En doch it sa gau as jo der oer tinke.
I could not let this happen	Ik koe dit net barre litte
I need you to get better	Ik haw jo nedich om better te wurden
This I have already told everyone	Dit haw ik elkenien al ferteld
He felt tired.	Hy fielde him wurch.
Just watch that movie.	Sjoch mar nei dy film.
There was a party of us together.	Der wie in feest fan ús tegearre.
I should not have said those things to her	Ik hie dy dingen net tsjin har sizze moatten
We are thinking about buying the house.	Wy tinke oer it keapjen fan it hûs.
But you never really know.	Mar jo witte noait echt.
Must have more.	Moatte mear hawwe.
That is how we have become.	Dat is hoe't wy binne wurden.
I never asked about her again	Ik haw noait wer oer har frege
It did before.	It die earder.
You come through this.	Jo komme troch dit.
But he could not be sure.	Mar hy koe der net wis fan wêze.
I did not care how beautiful it was	Ik hie der neat om hoe moai it wie
He looked at me.	Hy seach my oan.
Let's hope for the best.	Litte wy hoopje op it bêste.
I'm so glad you're here.	Ik bin sa bliid dat jo hjir binne.
Or maybe two.	Of miskien twa.
Walked to the door.	Rûn nei de doar.
The way for them.	De wei foar har.
I doubt it would have	Ik twifelje dat it soe hawwe
I liked the guy.	Ik mocht graach de keardel.
I knew she would, of course	Ik wist dat se dat soe, fansels
That was the truth.	Dat wie de wierheid.
But it's so much more than that.	Mar it is safolle mear as dat.
But it came to nothing.	Mar it kaam op neat.
I hope nothing but bad things for those people	Ik hoopje oars neat as minne dingen foar dy minsken
I just can not show it to you.	Ik kin it gewoan net oan dy sjen litte.
He had no children.	Hy hie gjin bern.
I ate as much as she would give me	Ik iet safolle as se my jaan soe
But it went.	Mar it gie.
Many bad things happened to her.	In protte minne dingen barde har mei.
I can not leave alone well enough	Ik kin net goed genôch allinnich litte
The truth was, she asked herself the same question.	De wierheid wie, se frege har itselde ôf.
There are big problems here.	Der binne grutte problemen hjir.
You know how they are now.	Jo witte hoe't se no binne.
I could not find them	Ik koe se net fine
Everyone is everyone.	Elkenien is elkenien.
I touched my hair.	Ik rekke myn hier oan.
I still remember seeing it	Ik wit noch dat ik it seach
That was what I wanted to keep.	Dat woe ik hâlde.
I love the place.	Ik hâld fan it plak.
I was always interested in your work	Ik wie altyd ynteressearre yn jo wurk
And get the job done.	En meitsje it wurk dien.
I've never seen them	Ik haw se nea sjoen
I love being around them	Ik hâld fan wêzen om har hinne
I do not know how.	Ik wit net hoe.
You will know it.	Jo sille it witte.
But, it is not a good read.	Mar, it is gjin goed lêzen.
Nobody knows what exactly happened.	Nimmen wit wat der krekt bard is.
I was hoping someone would come to me	Ik hope dat immen my komme soe
I did not expect anyone else to go home	Ik hie net ferwachte dat immen oars nei hûs soe
I had actually done nothing but go to school	Ik hie eins neat dien as nei skoalle gean
I can not believe you made it all here	Ik kin net leauwe dat jo it hjir hielendal makke hawwe
A child, she said	In bern, dat sei se
An opportunity has come to me.	In kâns is my kommen.
Show me her.	Lit my har sjen.
I thought you might.	Ik tocht dat jo miskien kinne.
Nothing can.	Neat kin.
I did not want to ask him if it was true	Ik woe him net freegje oft it wier wie
A lot of people go in and out	In protte minsken geane yn en út
People get in there though.	Minsken komme der wol yn.
No one ever really told me, but it was pretty clear.	Nimmen hat my oait echt ferteld, mar it wie frij dúdlik.
I was sure of nothing	Ik wie fan neat wis
I tried and it was not easy for me.	Ik haw besocht en it wie net maklik foar my.
And there's some truth to them.	En d'r is wat wierheid oan har.
I did not expect this	Ik hie dit net ferwachte
We'll be happy to tell you more about it !.	Wy fertelle jo der graach mear oer!.
It gave me a place to go.	It joech my in plak om te gean.
That's not how it works.	Sa wurket it net.
I knew it and was ready to help	Ik wist it en wie ree om te helpen
I really would not know	Ik soe it echt net witte
Many friends.	In protte freonen.
It was her children.	It wiene har bern.
I was never interested.	Ik wie noait ynteressearre.
I did so many things wrong	Ik die safolle dingen ferkeard
I thought he knew what you were doing.	Ik tocht dat hy wist wat jo dien hawwe.
I want this done already	Ik wol dat dit al dien wurdt
And must go.	En moat gean.
I felt it was the right thing to do	Ik fielde dat it it goede ding wie om te dwaan
It may find this so easy.	It kin fine dat dit sa maklik is.
I have read about him.	Ik haw oer him lêzen.
Maybe this will come in handy.	Miskien komt dit wol goed.
We did it then and there.	Wy diene it dan en dêr.
Now they have to do it.	No moatte se it dwaan.
I wonder what they did today.	Ik freegje my ôf wat se hjoed dien hawwe.
That would have been something.	Dat soe wat west hawwe.
I would be one of you	Ik soe ien fan dy wêze
I did not know where you were going	Ik wist net wêr't jo hinne wiene
I had to find them.	Ik moast se fine.
Come soon.	Komt gau.
All things beautiful.	Alle dingen moai.
But they had not met my parents yet.	Mar se hiene myn âlden noch net moete.
It would.	It soe.
I did what he did.	Ik die wat hy die.
I do not want to stay here	Ik wol hjir net bliuwe
It will not take much.	It sil net folle nimme.
If you do not want to.	As jo ​​net wolle.
But it does not matter.	Mar it makket neat út.
It made me sick.	It makke my siik.
I really, really wanted to	Ik woe echt, echt
I got home early and made some food	Ik kaam betiid thús en makke wat iten
I just wanted to tell you	Ik woe it dy mar fertelle
I will buy one again	Ik sil keapje ien wer
Better than bad	Better as te min
We were just people	Wy wiene mar minsken
I feel really bad about it	Ik fiel my dêr echt min oer
Go on, take it.	Gean troch, nim it.
Or not happen.	Of net barre.
They are ready to take, waiting for you to find them.	Se binne klear foar it nimmen, wachtsje op jo om se te finen.
Nice not back to work.	Moai net werom oan it wurk.
I still remember hearing about it	Ik wit noch dat ik dêr wat oer hearde
It will not do.	It sil net dwaan.
I had nothing for	Ik hie neat foar
It would be good.	It soe goed wêze.
I know he'll hurt you.	Ik wit dat hy dy sear dwaan sil.
In fact, there is not much to tell.	Eins is d'r net folle te fertellen.
I'll give you some money	Ik jou dy wat jild
But he had not come for help.	Mar hy wie net kommen om help.
I never let myself go there	Ik lit my der noait hinne gean
So often I did not get the chance	Sa faak krige ik de kâns net
I just had to do that before anything else	Ik moast dat mar foardat wat oars
She had no one left, no one to go to.	Se hie gjinien mear, gjinien om nei te gean.
I know the person you are	Ik ken de persoan dy't jo binne
I was just hoping it would work	Ik hie gewoan hope dat it soe wurkje
If they are the same, then that's fine.	As se itselde binne, dan is it goed.
I want to be free.	Ik wol frij wêze.
That he will not say.	Dat sil er net sizze.
It does not matter whether it is true or not.	It makket neat út oft it wier is of net.
But there must be a reason.	Mar der moat in reden wêze.
That made my father happy.	Dat fûn myn heit bliid.
But he knew it could not.	Mar hy wist dat it net koe.
That does not stop there.	Dat hâldt net op.
I felt sick.	Ik fielde my siik.
I've seen the truth	Ik haw de wierheid sjoen
I had nothing to do with this	Ik hie neat te dwaan dit
I know they need me.	Ik wit dat se my nedich hawwe.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Miskien, miskien, miskien.
I had not seen it before	Ik hie noch net earder sjoen
I will stay with mom.	Ik sil by mem bliuwe.
This time he did it.	Dizze kear hat er it dien.
People are beautiful.	Minsken binne moai.
So it will.	Sa sil it wol.
I can not tell you for sure	Ik kin it dy net wis sizze
I was probably rather scared to have that	Ik wie miskien earder bang om dat te hawwen
I saw that right away	Dat seach ik fuort
Yes.	Jo.
I really need it.	Ik haw it echt nedich.
She was not afraid.	Se wie net bang.
I could not believe he was actually mine	Ik koe net leauwe dat hy eins myn wie
A boy here, a girl there.	In jonge hjir, in famke dêr.
They themselves had never been.	Se hiene sels noait west.
I did not have too much to do with him.	Ik hie net al te folle mei him te dwaan.
I can do almost anything here	Ik kin hjir hast alles dwaan
I love water.	Ik hâld fan wetter.
I'll tell you something.	Ik sil dy wat fertelle.
Never thought about it like that.	Nea tocht oer it sa.
We should not try either.	Wy moatte ek net besykje.
I can not stop to look around me	Ik kin net ophâlde om my hinne te sjen
A few days ago it just went away	In pear dagen lyn gie it gewoan fuort
Of course Why not.	Fansels Wêrom net.
I had enough to go on	Ik hie genôch om troch te gean
Really, it's good.	Echt, it is goed.
What he did.	Wat hy dien hat.
I will not tell your parents	Ik sil it dyn âlden net fertelle
I do not want to talk now.	Ik wol no net prate.
He said it was good.	Hy sei dat it goed wie.
It's been here a long time.	It is hjir al lang.
I'm still thinking about that	Dêr tink ik noch oer nei
That hair is not from mother.	Dat hier is fan mem net.
She was happy to get a seat.	Se wie bliid om in sit te krijen.
It did not matter where.	It makke net út wêr.
Ask me how I know.	Freegje my hoe't ik it wit.
I can make it back myself	Ik kin it sels werom meitsje
But you are the first.	Mar do bist de earste.
I did not even know his name, but that did not matter	Ik wist net iens syn namme, mar dat hoegde net
I want them to play.	Ik wol dat se spylje.
I think he knew what he was talking about	Ik tink dat hy wist wêr't er it oer hie
The truth is, there are many.	De wierheid is, d'r binne in protte.
I do not know what to say.	Ik wit net wat ik sizze moat.
We have enough things to do.	Wy hawwe genôch dingen te dwaan.
I did not think of that	Dêr tocht ik net oan
I did not see it at first	Ik seach it earst net
I really liked that idea.	Dat idee fûn ik tige leuk.
I'm a kid.	Ik bin in bern.
Never seen such a thing.	Noch noait sa'n ding sjoen.
I'm tired of doing this	Ik bin wurch fan dwaan dit
I had nothing to eat	Ik ha neat te iten hân
I felt much better after talking to him.	Ik fielde my folle better nei it praten mei him.
I feel good when you are	Ik fiel my goed as jo binne
I walked around again, and again	Ik rûn wer om, en wer
This can not.	Dit kin net.
I did not want him to think of her now	Ik woe net dat er no oan har tocht
I think they like people.	Ik tink dat se graach minsken.
I know people.	Ik ken minsken.
That's better than nothing.	Dat is better as neat.
I know you have not come yet	Ik wit dat jo dat noch net kommen binne
That her family will be well.	Dat har famylje goed sil wêze.
Then again, he did not think so clearly.	Dan wer tocht er net sa dúdlik.
I know a lot of people	Ik ken in protte minsken
I have no idea what this could be	Ik haw gjin idee wat dit kin wêze
It had been waiting for him.	It hie op him wachte.
Even now she does that through.	Ek no docht se dat troch.
That would be good.	Dat soe goed wêze.
More than a little.	Mear as in bytsje.
I could not say the words	Ik koe de wurden net sizze
This scares me more.	Dit makket my mear bang.
I should have just left it there	Ik hie it der krekt litte moatten
To make him happy.	Om him bliid te meitsjen.
I knew it better than anyone	Ik wist it better as elkenien
There stands a woman	Dêr stiet in frou
I just need to do something	Ik moat gewoan wat dwaan
Maybe it should be so.	Miskien moat it sa wêze.
You know he is not.	Jo witte dat hy net is.
I do not want to be alone again	Ik wol net wer allinnich wêze
I wanted a friend	Ik woe in freon
Maybe it worked.	Miskien wurke it.
I know it's true	Ik wit dat it wier is
What now, they do not know.	Wat no ta, witte se net.
I had no time for this	Ik hie hjir gjin tiid foar
And it really makes it different.	En it makket it echt oars.
We just want to be together.	Wy wolle gewoan tegearre wêze.
If they only knew.	As se mar wisten.
That can not be.	Dat kin net.
He said we would have a week together.	Hy sei dat wy tegearre in wike ha soene.
I never want to hurt you	Ik wol dy noait sear dwaan
I have tried the following.	Ik haw it folgjende besocht.
He could not stop.	Hy koe net ophâlde.
That worked earlier.	Dat wurke earder.
I just did not want my family to do that.	Ik woe gewoan net dat myn famylje dat dwaan moast.
More than anything good.	Mear dan alles goed.
I just hope she has it over soon	Ik hoopje gewoan dat se it gau oer hat
I had realized this was going to happen	Ik hie realisearre dat dit barre soe
I'm nobody.	Ik bin nimmen.
Well, the last day is done now.	No, de lêste dei is no dien.
You should know exactly what to do.	Jo soene krekt witte wat te dwaan.
It seems to you somehow good.	It liket jo op ien of oare manier goed.
You know how these things are.	Jo witte hoe't dizze dingen binne.
I do not know where they come from.	Ik wit net wêr't se wei komme.
I still know how to do this before.	Ik wit noch dwaan dit foar.
I was a woman who had absolutely nothing to do with this.	Ik wie in frou dy't hjir hielendal neat mei te krijen hie.
He's not mine either.	Hy is ek net fan my.
Life is good, and can be made better.	It libben is goed, en kin better makke wurde.
Or the se.	Of die se.
You have no idea.	Jo hawwe gjin idee.
I had not been there	Ik hie der net west
Maybe they're just having a bad day.	Miskien hawwe se gewoan in minne dei.
That's the only way to get it to work.	Dat is de ienige manier om it oan it wurk te krijen.
I should have known for sure	Ik moast it wis witte
I'll see you next week.	Ik sjoch dy takom wike.
I thought, maybe we should go home today	Ik tocht, miskien moatte wy hjoed nei hûs
One who does not need a home.	Ien dy't gjin hûs nedich hat.
There he is.	Dêr is er.
He could not be here.	Hy koe hjir net wêze.
I would hurt people.	Ik soe minsken sear dwaan.
And maybe not.	En miskien net.
Can't eat either now.	Kin no ien fan beide net ite.
You have to stay with them.	Jo moatte by har bliuwe.
Dad never wanted her to be my wife.	Heit woe noait dat se myn frou wie.
Rather nice that.	Earder moai dat.
I had to make sure she was okay	Ik moast der wis fan dat se wie goed
He never got sick.	Hy is nea siik wurden.
I looked at the reason.	Ik seach nei de reden.
He looked at me.	Hy seach my oan.
I'm here with you	Ik bin hjir mei dy
I am only interested in the work.	Ik bin allinnich ynteressearre yn it wurk.
I would not want life without her	Ik soe it libben net sûnder har wolle
I think it's the best.	Ik tink dat it de bêste is.
Well, it's late.	No, it is let.
I walked into her room	Ik rûn har keamer yn
I really need you here, man.	Ik bin hjir echt nedich, man.
I think he's in me	Ik tink dat hy yn my is
But maybe not.	Mar miskien net.
That is, if there was a next trip.	Dat is, as der in folgjende tocht wie.
It’s a lot of things together.	It is in protte dingen tegearre.
I'll take it for sure.	Ik sil it der wis fan nimme.
He should be in a few months.	Hy moat oer in pear moanne.
I put my book away.	Ik sette myn boek fuort.
Hold his hand.	Hâld syn hân.
She never came back home.	Se kaam noait werom nei hûs.
You should not either.	Jo moatte ek net.
She knew who the man was.	Se wist wa't de man wie.
All you have are the things people do.	Alles wat jo hawwe binne de dingen dy't minsken dogge.
I think that was the only two they had	Ik tink dat dat de ienige twa wiene dy't se hiene
I believe you should look into it.	Ik leau dat jo der nei sjen moatte.
Not since last week.	Net sûnt ferline wike.
I should see	Ik soe sjen moatte
I would be too late.	Ik soe te let wêze.
I did not expect the.	Ik hie net ferwachte de.
I would not let them wait	Ik soe se net wachtsje litte wolle
But they are not here today.	Mar se binne hjir hjoed net.
I'm going up with you	Ik gean mei dy op
I believe we are through	Ik leau dat wy troch binne
I'm really thinking about it	Ik tink der echt oer nei
I know they're here	Ik wit dat se hjir binne
It looks like a real book.	It liket in echt boek.
Life went on without him.	It libben gie troch sûnder him.
You will not return.	Jo komme net werom.
He makes things happen.	Hy makket dingen barre.
She knew well.	Se wist wol.
I thought maybe he had not heard me	Ik tocht miskien hie er my net heard
Had to see everyone.	Moast elkenien sjen.
And it wasn’t just open either.	En it wie ek net allinnich iepen.
Well, not anymore.	No, net mear.
Nothing more than that.	Neat mear as dat.
I wish more people do this.	Ik winskje dat mear minsken dit dogge.
And not so long ago.	En net sa lang lyn.
She was everything.	Se wie alles.
I had to eat nothing	Ik moast neat ite

Wake up, people.	Wekker wurde, minsken.
I wanted to talk to him	Ik woe mei him prate
I have not come across you yet	Ik bin noch net oer dy hinne kommen
If it was wrong somehow.	As it ien of oare manier ferkeard wie.
I can not, she said.	Ik kin net, sei se.
I'm happy to hand it over to you	Ik bin bliid om it oan jo oer te jaan
But not this week.	Mar dizze wike net.
Just one man.	Krekt ien man.
I can not do this again	Ik kin dit net wer dwaan
We need to find a way to talk to them.	Wy moatte in manier fine om se te praten.
A person should always know who her father is	In persoan moat altyd witte wa't har heit is
I wondered where all her friends were	Ik frege my ôf wêr't al har freonen wiene
What's going on?.	Wat is d'r oan 'e hân?.
Visit her before he goes to work.	Besykje har foardat hy oan it wurk giet.
She wants to know what happened.	Se sil wol witte wat der bard is.
I know it's because of the size.	Ik wit dat it komt troch de grutte.
He could not see.	Hy koe net sjen.
I did not want anyone to talk to me	Ik woe net dat ien mei my prate soe
Lives there.	Wennet dêr om.

I would love to see you	Ik sjoch graach nei dy
I had no idea what it was	Ik hie gjin idee wat it wie
And we will do that today.	En dat sille wy hjoed dwaan.
Serve and serve.	Dien en dien.
From next year onwards, they will stop coming.	Fan takom jier ôf hâlde se op mei kommen.
So people don't think about it anymore.	Sa tinke minsken der net mear oer.
that works with me.	dat wurket mei my.
Maybe for the best.	Miskien foar it bêste.
I now think everyone knew it	Ik tocht no dat elkenien it wist
I hope to come there again one day	Ik hoopje der op in dei wer te kommen
I should have seen it earlier	Ik hie it earder sjen moatten
He's sick.	Hy is siik.
I'm with you.	Ik bin by dy.
I'm not quite sure how much more.	Ik bin der net hielendal wis fan hoefolle mear.
I wonder what you think of the place.	Ik freegje my ôf wat jo fan it plak fine.
It should be easy enough.	It moat maklik genôch wêze.
I had nothing else to do	Ik hie neat oars te dwaan
I wonder how old he is, actually	Ik freegje my ôf hoe âld hy is, eins
He was scared too.	Hy wie ek bang.
It has worked well so far.	It wurke oant no ta goed.
The truth is one truth.	De wierheid is ien wierheid.
That I could know all day	Dat koe ik de hiele dei witte
I totally agree with that	Ik bin it der hielendal mei iens
I will keep that in mind.	Ik sil dat yn gedachten hâlde.
I have a plan to do that	Ik haw in plan om dat te dwaan
They were both nice.	Se wiene beide aardich.
I will not let you go.	Ik lit dy net gean.
There is enough money.	Der is genôch jild.
He did the same for her.	Hy die itselde foar har.
He was one of my best friends.	Hy wie ien fan myn bêste freonen.
He did just that for himself in his time.	Hy die krekt wat foar himsels op syn tiid.
I was not sure there had been anything	Ik wie der net wis fan dat der wat west hie
I hope it never comes	Ik hoopje dat it noait komt
I just did not want to be late	Ik woe gewoan net te let komme
I knew they would never take them from me	Ik wist dat se har nea fan my nimme soene
They did not.	Se hiene net.
I saw you.	Ik seach dy.
Now is even before it happened.	No is noch foardat it barde.
I did not have to be someone like her	Ik hoegde net om ien as har te wêzen
People are afraid of it.	Minsken binne der bang foar.
It was a lot to take in at once.	It wie in protte om yn ien kear yn te nimmen.
I used to do it once three times a week	Ik die it eartiids trije kear yn 'e wike
We have no way of telling.	Wy hawwe gjin manier om te fertellen.
They are just all so good.	Se binne gewoan allegear sa goed.
I know you said you had a few days off	Ik wit dat jo sein hawwe dat jo in pear dagen frij hawwe
It was hard to say why.	It wie dreech om te sizzen wêrom.
I have to leave early tomorrow	Ik moat moarn betiid fuort
I can do nothing to prevent these things	Ik kin neat dwaan om dizze dingen foar te kommen
But it did not happen.	Mar it barde net.
And believe it.	En leau it.
She is like that too.	Se is ek sa.
She can do whatever she wants.	Se kin dwaan wat se wol.
I am other things too	Ik bin ek oare dingen
I'm opening it soon.	Ik doch it gau iepen.
Maybe that was the way to go.	Miskien wie dat de manier om te gean.
I knew you would see it my way	Ik wist dat jo it op myn manier soene sjen
Better than anyone else.	Better as immen oars.
I did not want that to happen	Ik woe net dat it barre soe
I did not even know	Ik wist it net iens
He might have had it already.	Hy hie it miskien al.
And two, this was not one of its kind.	En twa, dit wie net ien fan syn soarte.
I think that should be something to look at	Ik tink dat moat wat sjen nei
No one had done that before.	Nimmen hie dat earder dien.
