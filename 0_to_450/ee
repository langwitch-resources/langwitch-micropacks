I had to find that out myself.	Ele be nye ŋutɔ madi nya ma.
There is nothing more complicated than that.	Naneke meli si sesẽ wu ema o.
I found someone like you.	Mekpɔ ame aɖe abe wò ene.
Live long enough and some things will happen.	Nɔ agbe didi ale gbegbe eye nu aɖewo adzɔ.
Please define the project in more complex terms.	Taflatse ɖe dɔa gɔme le nya siwo sesẽ wu me.
It is absolutely possible.	Ate ŋui kura.
I think tonight was one of them.	Mesusu be zã sia nye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
I know this, of course.	Menya esia ya.
Something lifted up.	Nane kɔ ɖe dzi.
It's amazing	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ .
I personally don’t want to be here.	Nye ŋutɔ nyemedi be manɔ afisia o.
Like he doesn’t know you.	Abe alesi menya wò o ene.
It will make this work.	Ana esia nawɔ dɔ.
Take this part aside.	Tsɔ akpa sia ɖe vovo.
Put your name all over it.	De wò ŋkɔ ɖe edzi katã.
He can eat normally.	Ate ŋu aɖu nu le mɔ si sɔ nu.
Just last morning.	Ŋdi si va yi ko.
It’s very clear.	Eme kɔ nyuie.
We cannot know who he is or who he is.	Míate ŋu anya amesi wònye alo amesi wònye o.
On the previous day.	Le ŋkeke si do ŋgɔ dzi.
I couldn’t understand what was going on there.	Nyemete ŋu se nusi nɔ edzi yim le afima gɔme o.
Not very good anyway.	Menye nu nyui aɖeke kura o le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
But make it work.	Gake na wòawɔ dɔ.
You can’t seem to.	Edze abe màte ŋui o ene.
Yet he will do so.	Ke hã awɔe nenema.
Little money was lost.	Ga sue aɖe koe bu.
But it was only two days.	Gake ŋkeke eve koe wònye.
They have a life.	Agbe le wo si.
Speak up a lot.	Ƒo nu geɖe.
He put respect on her.	Etsɔ bubu da ɖe edzi.
I felt so small.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mele sue ŋutɔ.
He didn’t know where he was.	Menya afi si wòle o.
I don’t know what’s wrong with this.	Nyemenya nusi gblẽ le esia ŋu o.
In fact, people are not talking about anything else.	Le nyateƒe me la, amewo mele nu ƒom tso nu bubu aɖeke ŋu o.
It’s been a long night.	Zã didi aɖee nye esia.
But it is not too late to act.	Gake metsi megbe kokoko be woawɔ nane o.
I came here to collect.	Meva afisia be maƒo nu ƒu.
We are not doing anything wrong.	Menye ɖe míele nu gbegblẽ wɔm o.
I think they are and have been for a very long time.	Mesusu be wole nenema eye wole nenema ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ.
The truth is probably somewhere in between.	Anɔ eme be nyateƒea le wo dome le afi aɖe.
And in these moments he liked her.	Eye le ɣeyiɣi siawo me la, eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
But for a good reason.	Gake susu nyui aɖe tae.
I don’t think it is.	Nyemesusu be ele nenema o.
Clearly, he is not qualified for the job.	Edze ƒã be medze na dɔa o.
Obviously, this will take some time.	Edze ƒã be esia axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I'll get a job.	Makpɔ dɔ.
He kept his word.	Ewɔ ɖe eƒe nya dzi.
That way you can do whatever you want to do.	To mɔ sia dzi la, àte ŋu awɔ nu sia nu si nèdi be yeawɔ.
New features inside.	Nu yeye siwo le eme.
I want to know if anything changes.	Medi be manya ne nane trɔ.
He couldn’t escape them.	Mete ŋu si le wo nu o.
No one seems to be there.	Edze abe ame aɖeke mele afima ene o.
No one had any money.	Ga aɖeke menɔ ame aɖeke si o.
But not for too long.	Gake menye ɣeyiɣi didi akpa o.
He was calm too, almost calm.	Eƒe dzi dze eme hã, eƒe dzi dze eme kloe.
But it doesn’t seem to be.	Gake edze abe mele nenema o ene.
It was a morning like this.	Enye ŋdi aɖe abe esia ene.
I would have done that.	Anye ne mewɔe nenema hafi.
Anger is good.	Dziku nyo.
Eventually, there will be a cost to that.	Mlɔeba la, ga aɖe anɔ ema ŋu.
Something is bothering you.	Nane le fu ɖem na wò.
There is no other reason.	Susu bubu aɖeke meli o.
That’s the dog.	Emae nye avu la.
This is the opposite of that.	Esia to vovo na ema.
It’s personal.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
I can handle that.	Mate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ.
I have too much to do.	Nu geɖe akpa le asinye mawɔ.
I want to pray.	Medi be mado gbe ɖa.
Everyone knows each other.	Amesiame nya wo nɔewo.
The whole thing quickly got out of hand.	Nu bliboa do le asi me kaba.
Anything is possible, you know.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ, ènya.
Believe me, we’ll work it out.	Xɔ dzinye se, míawɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
The house is beautiful.	Aƒea nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
I am not alive now.	Nyemele agbe fifia o.
It had been a difficult day.	Ŋkeke sesẽ aɖee wònye tsã.
Her.	Eƒe.
However, there are two aspects.	Ke hã, akpa eve li.
This or nothing.	Esia alo naneke o.
You’re not supposed to fight.	Menye ɖe wòle be nàwɔ avu o.
That really impressed me.	Ema wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
His money ya.	Ga yeye ya.
His heart said he could.	Eƒe dzi gblɔ be yeate ŋui.
You're in too much of a hurry.	Èle kaba akpa.
He was a real talker.	Enye amesi ƒoa nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This was too important.	Esia nɔ vevie akpa.
In fact, everything is.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusianu le nenema.
It’s more of an idea.	Enye susu aɖe wu.
This dress is very expensive.	Awu sia xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I don’t understand this.	Nyemese esia gɔme o.
I just want to go out and do it.	Ðeko medi be mado go awɔe.
It’s not here for me.	Menye ɖe wòle afisia nam o.
Otherwise, it should work.	Ne menye nenema o la, ele be wòawɔ dɔ.
Help me out, guys! 	Kpe ɖe ŋunye!
Can you tell me about this place.	Àte ŋu agblɔ teƒe sia ŋu nya nam.
He was the only one who didn’t.	Eya ɖeka koe mewɔe nenema o.
It impressed him.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi nɛ.
This is so good and so simple.	Esia nyo ale gbegbe eye wòle bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I hope he always goes along with it.	Mekpɔ mɔ be awɔ ɖeka kplii ɣesiaɣi.
We have to work together.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ ɖekae.
I want one night, you want two.	Medi zã ɖeka, wò hã nèdi eve.
He seemed satisfied.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme ene.
We would love to work with you.	Adzɔ dzi na mí be míawɔ dɔ kpli wò.
He can still do that.	Ate ŋu awɔ ema kokoko.
But it doesn’t matter to me.	Gake mele vevie nam o.
That’s what I’m talking about.	Emae nye nye nya.
Or you can have anything.	Alo nusianu ate ŋu anɔ asiwò.
Look at all this money!	Kpɔ ga siawo katã ɖa!
People laughed.	Amewo ko nu.
It’s just not true.	Ðeko menye nyateƒe o.
I’m actually anxious to see you.	Le nyateƒe me la, metsi dzi be makpɔ wò.
His character is different.	Eƒe nɔnɔme to vovo.
Thanks so much for everything!.	Akpe geɖe na nusianu!.
I don’t know if that would do the trick, but it could happen.	Nyemenya ne ema awɔ dɔa o, gake ate ŋu adzɔ.
I just got home.	Ðeko meɖo aƒeme teti koe nye ema.
I think in this case we are making progress.	Mesusu be le go sia me la, míele ŋgɔ yim.
Have a loud conversation with others who know about this subject.	Dze nya kple ame bubu siwo nya nu tso nya sia ŋu la sesĩe.
That never existed.	Ema menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
His mind was racing.	Eƒe susu nɔ du dzi.
This summer, thousands died.	Le dzomeŋɔli sia me la, ame akpe geɖe ku.
What you want is not what you think you want.	Nu si dim nèle la menye nusi nèsusu be yedi o.
He was nowhere to be found.	Menɔ afi aɖeke o.
There is no name, of course.	Ŋkɔ aɖeke meli o ya.
This could not be more true.	Esia mate ŋu anye nyateƒe wu ema o.
I can’t speak right now.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu fifia o.
My dog ​​is talking to me all the time!	Nye avu le nu ƒom nam ɣesiaɣi!
And let me tell you one more thing.	Eye mina magblɔ nya ɖeka bubu na mi.
Hours and hours.	Gaƒoƒo kple gaƒoƒo ƒe ɣeyiɣi.
There! 	Afi ma!
that was enough for him.	ema sɔ gbɔ nɛ.
It’s not really an easy thing.	Menye nu bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
But there is also good reason.	Gake susu nyui hã le eme.
Still, it is important.	Ke hã, ele vevie.
He stroked his hair thoughtfully.	Etsɔ asi ƒo eƒe ɖa ŋu tsɔ bu eŋu.
Part of me desperately wanted that.	Nye akpa aɖe di nenema vevie.
Some of them are very good.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nyo ŋutɔ.
Perhaps he had something else in mind.	Ðewohĩ nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ susu me nɛ.
I was angry with myself.	Nye dziku nɔ ŋunye.
But in reality, the opposite is true.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae.
They may not have the necessary skills.	Ðewohĩ aɖaŋu siwo hiã la mele wo si o.
He is a real person.	Enye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That was our home.	Emae nye míaƒe aƒe.
So should his, too.	Nenema ke wòle be eya tɔ hã nanɔ nenema.
The trap in me is more of a problem.	Mɔ̃ si le menye la nye kuxi wu.
Nice to see you too.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mekpɔ wò hã.
He doesn’t know what time it is.	Menya ɣeyiɣi si me wòle o.
I was so glad I was talking about something relevant.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be menɔ nu ƒom tso nane si sɔ ŋu.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I never felt any of it.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me le wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o.
So far, it hasn’t.	Vaseɖe fifia la, mewɔe nenema o.
It’s part of my job.	Enye nye dɔa ƒe akpa aɖe.
Stop thinking about it altogether, really.	Dzudzɔ eŋu bubu kura, le nyateƒe me.
And he clearly cared deeply.	Eye eme kɔ ƒã be etsɔ ɖe le eme ale gbegbe.
His face was so angry.	Eƒe mo do dziku ale gbegbe.
We had food, water.	Nuɖuɖu nɔ mía si, tsi.
It probably won’t bother them.	Anɔ eme be maɖe fu na wo o.
Take that step.	Ðe afɔ ma.
I wish that were true.	Ne ɖe nya ma nye nyateƒe la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
I'll apologize.	Maɖe kuku.
He was a very great man.	Enye ame gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
So he doesn’t know how you are.	Eya ta menya ale si nèle o.
People still talk about it.	Amewo gakpɔtɔ ƒoa nu tso eŋu.
I am the only owner of the house.	Nye ɖeka koe nye aƒea tɔ.
But for now, at this moment.	Gake fifia ya, le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
I feel that way now.	Se le ɖokuinye me nenema fifia.
Many people agreed with him.	Ame geɖe da asi ɖe edzi.
This is perfect for them.	Esia sɔ nyuie na wo.
So did everyone else.	Nenema ke ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã wɔe.
I almost gave up.	Meɖe asi le eŋu kloe.
Look at his leg.	Kpɔ eƒe afɔ ɖa.
And we weren’t disappointed.	Eye dzi meɖe le mía ƒo o.
But so far there was no chance at all.	Gake vaseɖe fifia la, mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi kura o.
Some of them are working.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo le dɔ wɔm.
I found myself.	Mekpɔ ɖokuinye.
That’s what’s so difficult.	Emae nye nusi sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I could barely do it.	Ƒã hafi mete ŋu wɔe.
But that is not easy to do.	Gake ema wɔwɔ mele bɔbɔe o.
In the end, everything was right.	Mlɔeba la, nusianu va sɔ.
I don’t want anything to do with them.	Nyemedi be mawɔ naneke le wo ŋu o.
But not much longer.	Gake menye ɣeyiɣi didi wu ema kura o.
A piece of something.	Nane ƒe akpa aɖe.
Yet it is not a new issue.	Ke hã menye nya yeye aɖee wònye o.
What would have been wrong?	Nukae gblẽ hafi?
The clothes there were expensive.	Awu siwo nɔ afima xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
It’s something for next year, maybe.	Enye nane na ƒe si gbɔna, ɖewohĩ.
I now know what it is.	Menya nusi wònye azɔ.
What can we expect.	Nukae míate ŋu akpɔ mɔ na.
Twice a week.	Zi eve le kwasiɖa me.
It’s very short in shape.	Eƒe nɔnɔme le kpuie ŋutɔ.
Why do you want to do this?	Nukatae nèdi be yeawɔ esia?
His attitude is always good.	Eƒe nɔnɔme nyo ɣesiaɣi.
That just came out of this case.	Ðeko nya ma do le nya sia me.
There was no reason for that.	Susu aɖeke menɔ anyi si tae wòle nenema ɖo o.
It’s a real thing.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖee.
Money didn’t impress him much.	Ga mewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi boo o.
There is an obvious positive now.	Nu nyui aɖe li si dze ƒã fifia.
These men speak the same language.	Ŋutsu siawo doa gbe ɖeka.
You can have a great life here where you live.	Àte ŋu anɔ agbe gã aɖe le afisia le afisi nèle.
But if all goes well .	Gake ne nuwo katã yi nyuie la .
I lived with him for a very long time.	Menɔ anyi kplii ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
We’ve been there for a while.	Míele afima ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
The teacher asked a question.	Nufiala la bia nya aɖe.
But that is not possible for two reasons.	Gake ema mate ŋu adzɔ o le susu eve ta.
He did this for weeks.	Ewɔ esia kwasiɖa geɖe.
He just couldn’t do it.	Ðeko mete ŋu wɔe o.
It still seems too small.	Edze abe ɖe wòle sue akpa ene kokoko.
He couldn't worry about it now.	Mete ŋu tsi dzi ɖe eŋu fifia o.
I couldn’t give up.	Nyemete ŋu na ta o.
It didn’t work either.	Mewɔ dɔ hã o.
It’s neither here nor there, no thought or form.	Menye afisia alo afima o, susu alo nɔnɔme aɖeke meli o.
I'll know in a day or so.	Manya le ŋkeke ɖeka alo esi wu nenema megbe.
And I have a job.	Eye dɔ aɖe le asinye.
I want to share this with you.	Medi be magblɔ nya sia na mi.
Can't quite figure out how.	Mate ŋu aɖo alesi tututu o.
It obviously never worked.	Edze ƒã be mewɔ dɔ kpɔ o.
I arrived too late.	Meva tsi megbe akpa.
We need to move away from this idea.	Ele be míate ɖa le susu sia ŋu.
He can’t do anything.	Mate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
Many people died.	Ame geɖe ku.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
You can’t tell.	Màte ŋu anya o.
The house feels lively.	Aƒea me se le eɖokui me be amewo le eme.
I was really excited.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Two for the price of one.	Eve ɖe ɖeka ƒe asi ta.
This was a long time ago.	Esia nɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
Now we have to do two things.	Fifia ele be míawɔ nu eve.
I have made a mistake.	Mewɔ vodada aɖe kpɔ.
He has no reason.	Susu aɖeke mele esi o.
Everyone sat on everyone else.	Amesiame nɔ anyi ɖe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe dzi.
It can be a very difficult problem.	Ate ŋu anye kuxi sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
But there seems to be more here than that.	Gake edze abe nu geɖe le afisia wu ema ene.
To do something.	Be woawɔ nane.
I expected more.	Mekpɔ mɔ na nu geɖe wu.
None of it is original.	Eƒe akpa aɖeke menye gbãtɔ o.
This is money.	Esia nye ga.
But no one seemed to care.	Gake edze abe ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme o ene.
I would have told him where we were eating.	Megblɔ afisi míele nu ɖum le nɛ hafi.
Only on the highway.	Mɔ gã la dzi koe.
There was no sense in this.	Susu aɖeke menɔ nya sia ŋu o.
He’s too thin.	Eƒe lãme le sue akpa.
Not a word from anyone to anyone.	Menye nya aɖeke tso ame aɖeke gbɔ na ame aɖeke o.
Two of them went up in smoke.	Wo dometɔ eve yi dzi le dzudzɔ me.
There was a lot to do.	Nu geɖe nɔ anyi woawɔ.
Again, this is not true.	Le afisia hã la, esia menye nyateƒe o.
Things cannot stay static.	Nuwo mate ŋu anɔ anyi ɖe teƒe ɖeka o.
There was no fire in it.	Dzo aɖeke menɔ eme o.
So much happened in just a few days.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ dzɔ le ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo ko me.
The dress fits perfectly.	Awu la sɔ nyuie.
And it’s amazing.	Eye wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I have no money now.	Ga aɖeke mele asinye fifia o.
Perhaps this shouldn’t have surprised us.	Ðewohĩ mele be esia nawɔ nuku na mí hafi o.
I have been at his house a lot this year.	Menɔ eƒe aƒeme geɖe le ƒe sia me.
No new kind of people ever came into the house.	Ame yeye ƒomevi aɖeke meva aƒea me gbeɖe o.
Maybe someone is still inside.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe gakpɔtɔ le eme.
More time for it.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu ɖe eŋu.
They have something we don’t have.	Nane le wo si si mele mía si o.
I have time to shoot.	Ɣeyiɣi le asinye maɖe tu.
Some of that is already there.	Ema dometɔ aɖewo le afima xoxo.
This time it will be something else.	Fifia ya, anye nu bubu aɖe.
But get inside, get inside.	Gake ge ɖe eme, ge ɖe eme.
Clearly, this cannot be the case.	Edze ƒã be esia mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I had only heard of them.	Wo ŋu nya koe mese kpɔ.
And it’s the right thing to do.	Eye enye nu si sɔ be woawɔ.
At least the first part.	Akpa gbãtɔ ya teti.
I couldn’t save him.	Nyemete ŋu xɔ nɛ o.
Part of it fell past his ear.	Eƒe akpa aɖe ge to eƒe to ŋu.
Not right now at least.	Menye fifia ya teti o.
It’s clever.	Edze aɖaŋu.
Believe me, it is.	Xɔ dzinye se, ele nenema.
And that can’t happen.	Eye ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I hope that it is.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ele nenema.
He wouldn’t look away.	Maɖe ŋku ɖa le eŋu o.
But the money would be nice.	Gake ga la anyo ŋutɔ.
A long time on demand.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe le didi nu.
And you can’t do anything.	Eye màte ŋu awɔ naneke o.
But put this aside for now.	Gake da esia ɖe vovo na fifia.
He was satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme.
Endure .	Do dzi .
It’s easy, actually.	Ele bɔbɔe, le nyateƒe me.
He couldn’t work.	Mete ŋu wɔ dɔ o.
I remember being sick.	Meɖo ŋku edzi be medze dɔ.
I want to work with you.	Medi dɔ kpli wò.
He hadn’t told her that yet.	Megblɔ nya ma nɛ haɖe o.
Keep in mind what you have in mind.	Na nu si le susu me na wò la nanɔ susu me nam.
It doesn’t matter.	Vevie aɖeke mele eŋu o.
I think it probably is.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ele eme.
I think that’s appropriate.	Mesusu be esia sɔ.
There is another behind it.	Bubu hã le megbe nɛ.
Otherwise, more people would.	Ne menye nenema o la, anye ne ame geɖe wu awɔe.
There was smoke in the air.	Dzudzɔ nɔ ya me.
There is only one thing.	Nu ɖeka koe nye be.
Not everyone can do it.	Menye ame sia ame ate ŋu awɔe o.
Things are clear.	Nuwo me kɔ.
Everything is working fine.	Nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie.
Very few of them stayed there long.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ koe nɔ afima ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
Two of them died.	Wo dometɔ eve ku.
That will always be true.	Ema anye nyateƒe ɣesiaɣi.
I was nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe.
I think it’s a good job.	Mesusu be dɔ nyui aɖee wònye.
It was totally familiar to me.	Enye nusi menya kura nam.
He was still alone.	Eya ɖeka gakpɔtɔ nɔ anyi.
Or whatever it used to be.	Alo nusianu si nɔ anyi tsã.
Today, everyone does everything.	Egbea la, amesiame wɔa nusianu.
This is a serious mistake.	Esia nye vodada gã aɖe.
But this doesn’t have to be the case.	Gake mehiã be esia nanɔ nenema o.
But there was something odd about it.	Gake nane si mewɔ nuku o nɔ eme.
There is always enough water.	Tsi sɔ gbɔ ɣesiaɣi.
No smoke, no trouble.	Dzudzɔ aɖeke meli o, kuxi aɖeke meli o.
But an issue arose.	Gake nya aɖe do mo ɖa.
All he can do is.	Nusi ko wòate ŋu awɔ.
This is a personal one.	Esia nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
Two points became apparent.	Nya eve aɖewo va dze ƒã.
It was a more difficult task than he had ever expected.	Enye dɔ sesẽ aɖe si wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na wu tsã.
He had never been here before.	Meva afisia kpɔ o.
Someone who is very important.	Ame aɖe si le vevie ŋutɔ.
In fact, it was the only good part.	Le nyateƒe me la, eya koe nye akpa nyui si nɔ anyi.
His death was.	Eƒe ku nye.
I lost a lot of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe bu nam ŋutɔ.
It was a pleasure working with you.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be mewɔ dɔ kpli wò.
Not a little bit like that.	Menye nenema vie o.
No one had ever been there.	Ame aɖeke meva afima kpɔ o.
But now we are.	Gake fifia míenye nenema.
In a positive way.	Le mɔ aɖe si nyo nu.
No one will be talking.	Ame aɖeke maƒo nu o.
There is no other possibility.	Nu bubu aɖeke meli si ate ŋu adzɔ o.
There’s something different about her face.	Nane si to vovo le eƒe mo ŋu.
I have a reason.	Susu aɖe le asinye.
Think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ.
No one saw anything wrong with him.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ naneke si gblẽ le eŋu o.
I understand these words.	Mese nya siawo gɔme.
Add a little more water if needed.	Tsɔ tsi vi aɖe kpe ɖe eŋu ne ehiã.
No time for that right now.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli na ema fifia o.
This is not true.	Esia menye nyateƒe o.
But he couldn’t do it.	Gake mete ŋu wɔe o.
Winter can be a tough time.	Dzomeŋɔli ate ŋu anye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe.
One person at a time.	Ame ɖeka ɖe ɖeka ŋu.
He always had people behind him who supported him.	Amewo nɔa megbe nɛ ɣesiaɣi siwo nɔ megbe nɛ.
It’s like that.	Ele nenema.
He ate alone.	Eya ɖeka koe ɖu nu.
It makes absolutely no sense.	Susu aɖeke kura mele eme o.
It was a very difficult job.	Enye dɔ sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
And there was only one way.	Eye mɔ ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
Maybe we can combine them.	Ðewohĩ míate ŋu aƒo wo nu ƒu ɖekae.
I couldn’t explain it.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe eme o.
I want to come in the room and cheer them on.	Medi be mava xɔa me eye mado dzidzɔ na wo.
This went better than last time.	Esia yi edzi nyuie wu zi si va yi.
Yet this is quite the opposite.	Ke hã esia to vovo kura na ema.
That can’t be a bad thing.	Ema mate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ o.
There is some truth in the matter	Nyateƒe aɖe le nya la me
There is nothing small.	Nu sue aɖeke meli o.
However, this process is time consuming.	Gake ɖoɖo sia dzi wɔwɔ xɔa ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
I need to keep this in mind.	Ele be nya sia nanɔ susu me nam.
People really started liking him.	Amewo te eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Write down a few of them.	Ŋlɔ wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ɖi.
There are a lot of people in this town.	Ame siwo le du sia me sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
Only one team returned.	Teƒe ɖeka koe trɔ gbɔ.
I wanted to meet him.	Medi be mado go kplii.
I had a lot of fun.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ geɖe.
That statement is a lie, a lie, a lie.	Nya ma nye alakpa, alakpa, alakpa.
It’s just like you.	Ele abe wò ene.
I want to do this just like him.	Medi be mawɔ esia abe eya ke ene.
No money is needed.	Ga aɖeke mehiã o.
I couldn’t eat.	Nyemete ŋu ɖu nu o.
I'm sure of it.	Meka ɖe edzi.
I sincerely apologize to everyone.	Meɖe kuku na amesiame vevie.
And someone else, too.	Eye ame bubu aɖe hã.
How did you get your head so bad.	Aleke nèwɔ na wò ta gblẽ nu alea.
Now, the opposite happened.	Fifia, nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ.
Anger can be good.	Dziku ate ŋu anyo.
Things are going well.	Nuwo le edzi yim nyuie.
We hope you like them!.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be wo adzɔ dzi na wò!.
What it is.	Nusi wònye.
Just wanted to say keep it up!.	Ðeko medi be magblɔ be yi edzi!.
But, well.	Gake, nyuie.
Thinking about what really matters in the long run.	Nusi le vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe megbe la ŋu bubu.
He himself did not understand at all.	Eya ŋutɔ mese egɔme kura o.
You already told me your own name.	Ègblɔ wò ŋutɔ wò ŋkɔ nam xoxo.
But someone is missing.	Gake ame aɖe bu.
And my mind.	Kple nye susu.
We don’t have anything.	Naneke mele mía si o.
Now that is very important.	Fifia ema le vevie ŋutɔ.
The death didn’t bother him.	Ku la meɖe fu nɛ o.
Just now, anyway.	Fifia ko, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
It could be something else.	Ate ŋu anye nu bubu aɖe hã.
Just not today.	Ðeko menye egbea o.
Instead of this.	Le esia teƒe.
Maybe in a year or two.	Ðewohĩ le ƒe ɖeka alo eve megbe.
Maybe he doesn’t know himself.	Ðewohĩ eya ŋutɔ menya o.
It was never one face.	Menye mo ɖeka gbeɖe o.
A good fit is better.	Nusi sɔ nyuie nyo wu.
I was the only one in the house.	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ aƒea me.
Only the fire.	Dzo la koe.
This is true in life.	Esia nye nyateƒe le agbe me.
The death toll has increased dramatically.	Ame siwo ku la dzi ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
And before that, another.	Eye do ŋgɔ na ema la, bubu.
Any place, any time.	Teƒe ɖesiaɖe, ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe.
We’re just going to give up.	Ðeko míele asi ɖe ge.
He didn’t care, anyway.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
A little can go a long way.	Susu sue aɖe ko ate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
This is also a mistake.	Esia hã nye vodada.
There is no one in it.	Ame aɖeke mele eme o.
Or me.	Alo nam.
Not the loss itself.	Menye nusi bu la ŋutɔ o.
Be there with them.	Nɔ afima kpli wo.
It was part of the afternoon.	Ŋdɔ ƒe akpa aɖee nye ema.
We never knew what to do with.	Míenya nusi míawɔ na gbeɖe o.
What is right is good.	Nusi sɔ la nyo.
This didn’t when it was new.	Esia mewɔe esime wònye yeye o.
This is a legal document.	Esia nye se ƒe agbalẽ.
I have done this before.	Mewɔ esia do ŋgɔ.
He can do the same for you today.	Ate ŋu awɔ nenema ke na wò egbea.
No one else has ever done that for you.	Ame bubu aɖeke mewɔ nu ma na wò kpɔ o.
And let me explain that.	Eye mina maɖe nya ma me.
Maybe not much, maybe a long time ago.	Ðewohĩ menye nu geɖe o, ɖewohĩ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
The building itself is important.	Xɔa ŋutɔ le vevie.
It’s really weird and wonderful.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ eye wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
In contrast, he could not remember much.	To vovo na ema la, mete ŋu ɖo ŋku nu geɖe dzi o.
I doubt you have much money on hand.	Meke ɖi be ga geɖe le asiwò le asiwò.
I can’t speak right now.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu fifia o.
This went on for hours.	Esia yi edzi gaƒoƒo geɖe.
It hit me.	Edze dzinye.
That qualifies me a bit.	Ema dze nam vie.
We can’t do it without your help.	Míate ŋu awɔe wò kpekpeɖeŋu manɔmee o.
The apartment itself is amazing.	Xɔa ŋutɔ wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That’s not so easy to find.	Ema didi mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
I can handle it on my own.	Mate ŋu akpɔ edzi le ɖokuinye si.
To do hard work.	Be woawɔ dɔ sesẽ.
I can’t find one.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ɖeka o.
But this week, something changed.	Gake le kwasiɖa sia me la, nane trɔ.
How exciting this is.	Aleke gbegbe esia doa dzidzɔ na ame enye si.
He had never done this before.	Mewɔ esia kpɔ o.
It’s a pretty big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
That really launched his career.	Emae nye nusi dze eƒe dɔa gɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I remembered that.	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi.
Sweat came down on his face.	Fifia va ƒo ɖe eƒe mo.
It’s not that bad.	Menye nu gbegblẽ nenema gbegbe o.
He would be very pleased.	Adzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I began to really like him.	Mete eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But there was one thing missing.	Gake nu ɖeka aɖe nɔ anyi si bu.
Time is fire and fury.	Ɣeyiɣi nye dzo kple dziku.
But he wasn’t the only survivor.	Gake menye eya ɖeka koe tsi agbe o.
I wish I had said more.	Anyo ŋutɔ ne megblɔ nya geɖe wu hafi.
I’m glad he finally did something at home.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ewɔ nane le aƒeme mlɔeba.
It will take several days.	Axɔ ŋkeke geɖe.
But! 	Gake!
They have to work at night.	Ele be woawɔ dɔ le zã me.
I planned on being surprised.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu be wòawɔ nuku nam.
It’s just water here.	Tsi koe nye esia le afisia.
Nice to meet you, man.	Edzɔ dzi nam be medo go wò, ŋutsu.
This just works.	Ðeko esia wɔa dɔ.
Focus on that now.	Lé fɔ ɖe ema ŋu fifia.
You can see everything.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusianu.
A head appeared.	Ta aɖe do.
Few people have worn them yet.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe do wo haɖe.
We all know about it in some way.	Mí katã míenya nu tso eŋu le mɔ aɖe nu.
I knew that was a long shot.	Menya be tu didi aɖee nye ema.
That’s the first thing.	Emae nye nu gbãtɔ.
Write in as many times as you like.	Ŋlɔ eme zi alesi nèdi.
The king was in a difficult situation.	Fia la nɔ nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe me.
This is just our first project tonight.	Esia nye míaƒe dɔ gbãtɔ ko le zã sia me.
That was very exciting for me.	Ema do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
However, everyone makes mistakes.	Ke hã, ame sia ame wɔa vodada.
Or any school day.	Alo suku ŋkeke ɖesiaɖe.
His hand shot up.	Eƒe asi da tu yi dzi.
He didn’t want to go.	Medi be yeayi o.
I don’t think they are.	Nyemesusu be wole nenema o.
I knew the truth would eventually come out.	Menya be nyateƒea ava do mlɔeba.
But there is another issue on the horizon.	Gake nya bubu aɖe hã le ŋgɔ gbɔna.
I couldn’t let go of myself.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu o.
I can’t see you.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wò o.
Or it may be so.	Alo ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
That might explain it.	Ema ate ŋu aɖe eme.
A good parallel point.	Nya nyui aɖe si sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
There is no one, ever.	Ame aɖeke meli o, gbeɖe o.
A very nice person.	Ame nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
That same afternoon.	Le ŋdɔ ma ke me.
It’s the ultimate possibility.	Enye nu mamlɛtɔ si ate ŋu adzɔ.
I came here to stay.	Meva afisia be manɔ anyi.
It was somewhere else.	Enye teƒe bubu aɖe.
A highway parallel to another highway.	Mɔ gã aɖe si sɔ kple mɔ gã bubu.
Or it could be something else.	Alo ate ŋu anye nu bubu aɖe.
In the air in the room.	Le ya si le xɔa me me.
He wasn’t busy.	Vovo menɔ eŋu o.
I will let things go.	Maɖe asi le nuwo ŋu.
That’s why he was on his way now.	Esia tae wònɔ mɔ dzi fifia ɖo.
This does not seem to be the case.	Edze abe esia mele nenema o ene.
I don't know why this isn't working.	Nyemenya nusita esia mele dɔ wɔm o.
I'm going to kill you.	Mele wò wu ge.
I glanced at them too.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe wo hã ŋu.
This is already.	Esia nye xoxo.
Until last night.	Vaseɖe zã si va yi me.
There is obviously money involved.	Edze ƒã be ga le eme.
You have issues you are working on or an idea.	Nya siwo ŋu nèle dɔ wɔm le alo susu aɖe le asiwò.
I couldn’t do it, until now.	Nyemete ŋu wɔe o, vaseɖe fifia.
He will see for himself what is going on.	Eya ŋutɔ akpɔ nusi le edzi yim.
That goes for everyone.	Ema yi na amesiame.
I am trying to do it this way.	Mele agbagba dzem be mawɔe alea.
There was no one else there for him to see.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afima si wòate ŋu akpɔ o.
I think he did a really good job there.	Mesusu be ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ le afima.
There was no food either.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke hã menɔ anyi o.
I miss you so much.	Mesusu wò ale gbegbe.
At the edge of a lake.	Le ta aɖe to.
I didn’t know you had to have one.	Nyemenya be ele be ɖeka nanɔ asiwò o.
He threw his mind away.	Etsɔ eƒe susu ƒu gbe.
Whatever works for you personally to get the job done.	Nusianu si awɔ dɔ na wò ŋutɔ be nàwɔ dɔa.
Maybe there are too many of us.	Ðewohĩ mía dometɔ geɖe sɔ gbɔ akpa.
Hit me up when you feel comfortable.	Ƒo dzinye ne wò dzi dze eme.
That works well.	Ema wɔa dɔ nyuie.
Perhaps he is one of them.	Ðewohĩ enye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
You can’t win.	Màte ŋu aɖu dzi o.
I don’t understand why we’re doing this.	Nyemese nusita míele esia wɔm gɔme o.
I needed anger.	Mehiã dziku.
It seems like a new thing.	Edze abe nu yeye ene.
He did it alone.	Eya ɖeka koe wɔe.
I looked around the house.	Mekpɔ aƒea me.
But he fought them all.	Gake ewɔ avu kple wo katã.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
No one did that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
No life from it, no joy.	Agbe aɖeke meli tso eme o, dzidzɔ aɖeke meli o.
He has yet to tell police.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke na kpovitɔwo haɖe o.
The anti-everything side of.	Akpa si tsi tre ɖe nusianu ŋu le.
There are two reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo li siwo tae.
But this is not possible now for two reasons.	Gake esia mate ŋu adzɔ fifia o le susu eve ta.
I'm waiting for you.	Mele lalam na wò.
This is appropriate for several reasons.	Esia sɔ le susu geɖe ta.
I am being extreme.	Mele nu wɔm le mɔ si gbɔ eme nu.
This time, everything is different between us.	Fifia ya, nusianu to vovo le mía dome.
We never had much money.	Ga geɖe menɔ mía si kpɔ o.
That didn’t bother him.	Ema meɖe fu nɛ o.
He just doesn’t know how much.	Ðeko menya alesi gbegbe wòle o.
There didn’t seem to be any problems there.	Edze abe kuxi aɖeke menɔ afima o ene.
There is also a good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe hã tae.
But it’s not easy.	Gake menye nu bɔbɔe o.
I stood in his way.	Metsi tre ɖe eƒe mɔ dzi.
I had to see a man about a horse.	Ele nam be makpɔ ŋutsu aɖe si ku ɖe sɔ aɖe ŋu.
What is it today.	Nukae nye egbea.
It worked the same way.	Ewɔ dɔ nenema ke.
But it didn’t bother them.	Gake meɖe fu na wo o.
No sweat though.	Fifia aɖeke meli o gake.
But that didn’t happen.	Gake ema meva eme o.
Life is good again.	Agbe nyo ake.
You can go with whatever you want.	Àte ŋu ayi kple nusianu si nèdi.
I just can’t get enough.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
An idea came to him.	Susu aɖe va susu me nɛ.
I know how to find out.	Menya alesi mawɔ anya.
We don’t know what to do.	Míenya nusi míawɔ o.
And he didn’t worry.	Eye metsi dzi o.
I couldn’t find any.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeke ŋu o.
That was my first one.	Emae nye nye gbãtɔ.
No clue as to what kind.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke meli ku ɖe nu ka ƒomevi ŋu o.
. . . .	.
He also had some other guns.	Tu bubu aɖewo hã nɔ esi.
It can happen.	Ate ŋu adzɔ.
This couldn’t be done.	Esia mete ŋu wɔ o.
There was a part of me that needed more.	Nye akpa aɖe nɔ anyi si hiã geɖe wu.
Maybe more, or maybe the other way around.	Ðewohĩ awɔ geɖe wu, alo ɖewohĩ awɔe le mɔ bubu nu.
We can’t eat at your house today.	Míate ŋu aɖu nu le wò aƒeme egbea o.
No one should behave that way.	Mele be ame aɖeke nawɔ nu nenema o.
Your frequency is very different.	Wò zi gbɔ zi geɖe la to vovo kura.
I haven’t heard this kind of thing myself.	Nye ŋutɔ nyemese nya sia ƒomevi o.
He wasn't there the day before.	Menɔ afima ŋkeke si do ŋgɔ o.
You are my life.	Wòe nye agbe nam.
I do not know.	Nye menya o.
I had a lot to say to him.	Nya geɖe nɔ asinye magblɔ nɛ.
They are expected.	Wole mɔ kpɔm na wo.
Almost a year has passed.	Ƒe ɖeka kloe va yi.
I have never seen anything so beautiful in my life.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si nya kpɔ alea gbegbe le nye agbe me kpɔ o.
It was a beautiful day.	Enye ŋkeke si nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
Not now or never.	Menye fifia alo menye gbeɖe o.
I did it with this.	Mewɔe kple esia.
Do they have money?	Ðe ga le wo sia?
But he did something wrong.	Gake ewɔ nu gbegblẽ.
There are two good reasons for this.	Susu nyui eve aɖewo tae wòle nenema ɖo.
But this doesn’t matter.	Gake esia mele vevie o.
There are better ways.	Mɔ siwo nyo wu li.
But something seems to be different.	Gake edze abe nane to vovo ene.
Clearly, something needs to be done about it.	Ele eme kɔ ƒã be ele be woawɔ nane tso eŋu.
I just didn't know how to deal with it.	Ðeko nyemenya alesi mawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu o.
It would be great to see you.	Anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ be makpɔ wò.
I need everybody there.	Mehiã amesiame le afima.
Do come back.	Do va trɔ gbɔ.
Probably some hours.	Anɔ eme be gaƒoƒo aɖewo.
Shoot my dog ​​once.	Da tu nye avu zi ɖeka.
That sounds great.	Ema ɖi nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Or the same thing.	Alo nenema ke.
There is another problem in this case.	Kuxi bubu aɖe hã le nya sia me.
What a name that is.	Ŋkɔ kae nye ema.
Which one is right for you?.	Wo dometɔ kae sɔ na wò?.
They had no children.	Vi aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
I am just getting started.	Ðeko mele egɔme dzem.
Just think of today.	Bu egbea ŋu kpɔ ko.
He obviously didn’t.	Edze ƒã be mewɔe nenema o.
And they all suffered from the same problem.	Eye kuxi ɖeka ma ke ɖe fu na wo katã.
Through no fault of my own.	To nye ŋutɔ nye vodada aɖeke me o.
We have no one to deal with.	Ame aɖeke mele mía si míawɔ nu kplii o.
I think he's ready to handle that.	Mesusu be ele klalo be yeakpɔ ema gbɔ.
And there’s something behind it.	Eye nane le megbe nɛ.
That’s easy.	Ema le bɔbɔe.
I was the one who was nervous.	Nyee nye amesi tsi dzodzodzoe.
There was no support for that.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke menɔ anyi na ema o.
This tells us a few things.	Esia gblɔ nu ʋɛ aɖewo na mí.
This is something you don’t want to do.	Esia nye nusi mèdi be yeawɔ o.
As it was, there wasn’t much wrong.	Abe alesi wònɔ ene la, nu gbegblẽ boo aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I came here.	Meva afisia.
It will definitely take time.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi godoo.
I’m glad they’re all here.	Enye dzidzɔ nam be wo katã wole afisia.
But nothing is easy here.	Gake naneke mele bɔbɔe le afisia o.
The type or location of the object is not important.	Nu ƒomevi alo teƒe si nu la le mele vevie o.
I distanced myself from him.	Meɖe ɖokuinye ɖa le eŋu.
In fact, he wasn’t sure he could do this.	Le nyateƒe me la, meka ɖe edzi be yeate ŋu awɔ esia o.
That wasn’t true before.	Ema menye nyateƒe tsã o.
But he never did anything.	Gake mewɔ naneke kpɔ o.
I am sure I am.	Meka ɖe edzi be mele nenema.
You’re in the car.	Wò le ʋua me.
This is not very surprising.	Esia mewɔ nuku boo aɖeke o.
He was a dedicated teacher.	Enye nufiala si tsɔ eɖokui na.
And in everyone.	Eye le amesiame me.
He will not be in this position.	Manɔ nɔnɔme sia me o.
The issue is very difficult.	Nya la sesẽ ŋutɔ.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
It will benefit everyone.	Aɖe vi na amesiame.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
This situation in itself is not a bad thing.	Nɔnɔme sia ŋutɔ menye nu gbegblẽ o.
The blood came out of it.	Ʋua do le eme.
He didn’t want to be like that.	Medi be yeanɔ nenema o.
I know it’s just a matter of time.	Menya be ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
I can’t give you anything.	Nyemate ŋu ana naneke wò o.
Just like it used to be.	Abe alesi wònɔ tsã ene.
. . . .	.
And he died the same way.	Eye eya hã ku nenema.
Stand up strong!	Tsi tre sesĩe!
I had never heard of him.	Nyemese eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
I was very, very pleased.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
He is working really hard.	Ele dɔ wɔm sesĩe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Make more money.	Kpɔ ga geɖe wu.
He didn’t trust the dog.	Meka ɖe avu la dzi o.
This makes sense on the one hand.	Susu le eme be woawɔ esia le go ɖeka me.
Actually, do this, at least for today.	Le nyateƒe me la, wɔ esia, na egbea ya teti.
Pause for a moment.	Dzudzɔ vie.
It is absolutely impossible.	Enye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ kura o.
Many, many, many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe, geɖe, geɖe.
Show us who you are.	Fia ame si nènye la mí.
Not that he ever will.	Menye be awɔe gbeɖe o.
Everyone who came to live with us.	Ame sia ame si va nɔ mía gbɔ.
The truth is different.	Nyateƒea to vovo.
There was no water there.	Tsi aɖeke menɔ afima o.
I have a good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖe le asinye.
The foot is.	Afɔ nye.
Eventually, they got tired.	Mlɔeba la, ɖeɖi te wo ŋu.
If someone goes out, hold them up.	Ne ame aɖe do go la, lé wo ɖe dzi.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Tell me something new.	Gblɔ nya yeye aɖe nam.
Remove everyone at the same time.	Ðe amesiame ɖa le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
But he never told you the truth.	Gake megblɔ nyateƒea na wò kpɔ o.
In the last week before his death.	Le kwasiɖa mamlɛtɔ si do ŋgɔ na eƒe ku me.
But there was something different.	Gake nane aɖe nɔ anyi si to vovo na esia.
This used to be very difficult to set up properly.	Tsã la, esia ɖoɖo nyuie sesẽ ŋutɔ.
We were discouraged.	Dzi ɖe le mía ƒo.
It is an interesting point.	Enye nya aɖe si doa dzidzɔ na ame.
There is no mistake there.	Vodada aɖeke mele afima o.
Everything is new and in good shape.	Nusianu nye yeye eye wòle nɔnɔme nyui me.
That’s why we’re here.	Eya tae míele afisia ɖo.
I can’t remember who hit me or what happened.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku amesi ƒom alo nusi dzɔ dzi o.
I have never been so excited about anything in my life.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe naneke ŋu nenema gbegbe le nye agbe me kpɔ o.
But he can’t do it.	Gake mate ŋui o.
It worked this time.	Ewɔ dɔ zi sia.
Everything else is easy.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe le bɔbɔe.
I was running almost an hour late.	Menɔ du dzi gaƒoƒo ɖeka kloe megbe.
Everything was fine for about an hour.	Nusianu nɔ nyuie abe gaƒoƒo ɖeka ene.
A couple of people we know have worked on this.	Ame eve aɖewo siwo míenya la wɔ dɔ tso esia ŋu.
He didn’t worry about it.	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu o.
Come on, now.	Va, fifia.
It was a day or two.	Enye ŋkeke ɖeka alo eve.
Stop whatever you are doing.	Dzudzɔ nusianu si wɔm nèle.
We are not working.	Míele dɔ wɔm o.
Some things were less important, and some things are more important.	Nu aɖewo menɔ vevie boo o, eye nu aɖewo hã le vevie wu.
He did his part.	Ewɔ eƒe akpa aɖe.
A good way to go.	Mɔ nyui aɖe.
Or ‘that’.	Alo ‘ko’.
I couldn’t do them.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ wo o.
Part of it is shot.	Eƒe akpa aɖe tu.
Each one has a time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe le wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe si.
He is here to stay here for two weeks.	Ele afisia be yeanɔ afisia kwasiɖa eve.
Your life isn’t worth that much.	Wò agbe mexɔ asi nenema o.
Get up, get dressed, go to school.	Tso, do awu, yi suku.
For many reasons, actually.	Le susu geɖe ta, le nyateƒe me.
If the item continues to operate for a long time.	Ne nu la yi edzi le dɔ wɔm ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
In many ways.	Le mɔ geɖe nu.
But, you know,.	Gake, ènya,.
Another mistake, too.	Vodada bubu hã.
Be careful, guys.	Kpɔ nyuie.
Everything about them rings true.	Nusianu si ku ɖe wo ŋu la ɖi nyateƒe.
But on my own.	Gake le ɖokuinye si.
Or he won’t.	Alo mawɔe o.
You know everything well, but you really know nothing about nothing.	Ènya nusianu nyuie, gake le nyateƒe me la, ènya naneke tso naneke ŋu o.
The truth is clear.	Nyateƒea me kɔ nyuie.
At this hour he cannot eat.	Le gaƒoƒo sia me la, mate ŋu aɖu nu o.
I wasn’t sure what to do.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi woawɔ dzi o.
You're in way over your head here.	Èle mɔ dzi le wò ta dzi le afisia.
This is not a mistake.	Esia menye vodada o.
We cannot know exactly what is lacking and what it is.	Míate ŋu anya nusi tututu mehiã o kple nusi wònye o.
I wish he hadn’t done that.	Ne ɖe mewɔe nenema o la, anye ne mewɔe nenema o.
Go ahead, look at reality.	Yi ŋgɔ, lé ŋku ɖe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋu.
Add more water if needed.	Tsɔ tsi bubu kpe ɖe eŋu ne ehiã.
And this has now happened.	Eye esia va dzɔ azɔ.
Can’t go on without him.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi eya manɔmee o.
However, this is not necessarily true.	Ke hã, esia menye nyateƒe kokoko o.
The price of tea has gone up dramatically.	Te ƒe asi yi dzi ŋutɔ.
Do something else.	Wɔ nu bubu aɖe.
The whole thing is really, really, very surreal.	Nu bliboa nye nyateƒe, ŋutɔŋutɔ, nusi gbɔ eme ŋutɔ.
That will work for me.	Ema awɔ dɔ nam.
I have never known.	Nyemenya kpɔ o.
What? 	Nu ka?
Without water, life is impossible	Tsi manɔmee la, agbe mate ŋu adzɔ o
But I may have missed one.	Gake ɖewohĩ ɖeka to ŋunye.
Or at least his name.	Alo eƒe ŋkɔ ya teti.
That might make sense to someone.	Ðewohĩ susu anɔ nya ma me na ame aɖe.
There are very few things to do.	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe li woawɔ.
But this is a possibility.	Gake esia ate ŋu adzɔ.
Indeed.	Le nyateƒe me.
Someone who is independent.	Ame aɖe si le eɖokui si.
No one at all believed this.	Ame aɖeke kura mexɔ nya sia dzi se o.
Like the day before.	Abe ŋkeke si do ŋgɔ ene.
They need to perform better than they are.	Ele be woawɔ dɔ nyuie wu alesi wole.
I always knew.	Menya ɣesiaɣi.
Life from death.	Agbe tso ku me.
There is no place.	Teƒe aɖeke meli o.
He did a great job of that this summer.	Ewɔ dɔ gã aɖe le ema ŋu le dzomeŋɔli sia me.
I finally found the truth.	Meva ke ɖe nyateƒea ŋu mlɔeba.
As you wish.	Abe alesi nèdi ene.
The night is out.	Zã do.
Update your home every few years.	Trɔ asi le wò aƒea ŋu ƒe ʋɛ aɖewo ɖesiaɖe.
It wasn’t like that.	Menɔ nenema o.
Yet it is a way.	Ke hã mɔ aɖee.
Let me fuck you.	Na ma fu wò.
It would have been nice to have a dog.	Anyo ŋutɔ ne avu aɖe nanɔ asiwò hafi.
Is there nothing to be done about it.	Ðe menye naneke si woawɔ tso eŋu oa.
I need a booze.	Mehiã aha sesẽ.
I arrived early, but not early.	Meva ɖo kaba, gake menye kaba o.
Only I can do it.	Nye ɖeka koe ate ŋu awɔe.
I had to hurry up.	Ele be mawɔ kaba.
We have to have a reason.	Ele be susu aɖe nanɔ mía si.
And it can be that way.	Eye ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
Keep going inside.	Yi edzi ge ɖe eme.
Are you starving.	Ðe dɔ le wò ɖem le ŋuwò.
I tried to figure out what to say.	Medze agbagba manya nya si magblɔ.
Take a look around this ship.	Lé ŋku ɖe meli sia ŋu godoo.
I would still do it myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mawɔe kokoko.
I understand these people.	Mese ame siawo gɔme.
His own way.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe mɔ.
Perhaps this is possible.	Ðewohĩ esia anya wɔ.
It was a very difficult job.	Enye dɔ sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
More water in the summer.	Tsi geɖe wu le dzomeŋɔli.
I’m sure every man has done that.	Meka ɖe edzi be ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe wɔe nenema.
He didn’t need anything.	Naneke mehiã nɛ o.
There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eme o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But this is obviously not part of the job.	Gake edze ƒã be esia menye dɔa ƒe akpa aɖeke o.
But, and because of this.	Gake, eye le esia ta.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It worked for me.	Ewɔ dɔ nam.
Where things fit in my life.	Afisi nuwo sɔ le le nye agbe me.
One person found a house.	Ame ɖeka kpɔ aƒe aɖe.
The bad voices people did to him.	Gbe gbegblẽ siwo amewo wɔ ɖe eŋu.
Yet he could not understand it.	Ke hã mete ŋu se egɔme o.
I’ve never seen one before.	Nyemekpɔ ɖeka kpɔ o.
Some of them survived.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo tsi agbe.
I know what time it is.	Menya ɣeyiɣi si me wòle.
It seems so simple.	Edze abe ɖe wòle bɔbɔe ŋutɔ ene.
Months passed, but he could not return.	Ɣleti geɖe va yi, gake mete ŋu trɔ gbɔ o.
I needed help.	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu.
Life is life, food is just there.	Agbe nye agbe, nuɖuɖu le afima ko.
I never saw what happened after that.	Nyemekpɔ nusi dzɔ le ema megbe kpɔ o.
The house will be comfortable soon.	Aƒea me ava nɔ bɔbɔe kpuie.
Everyone is talking about it.	Amesiame le nu ƒom tso eŋu.
It’s very charming.	Eƒe nu lé dzi na ame ŋutɔ.
I want to solve something.	Medi be makpɔ nane gbɔ.
He has no chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke mele esi o.
He wouldn’t have understood.	Anye ne mese egɔme o.
Everything works so well together.	Nusianu wɔa dɔ ɖekae nyuie ale gbegbe.
I wonder when this will happen.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɣekaɣie esia ava dzɔ hã.
I don’t know myself from it.	Menye menya ɖokuinye tso eme o.
And to have someone there to tell you that.	Eye be ame aɖe nanɔ afima agblɔ nya ma na wò.
Your man went up.	Wò ame yi dzi.
But somehow he couldn’t.	Gake le mɔ aɖe nu la, mete ŋui o.
There was nothing he could say.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu agblɔ o.
One thing we can never have is time.	Nu ɖeka si míate ŋu akpɔ gbeɖe o enye ɣeyiɣi.
There are some things you can never do.	Nu aɖewo li siwo màte ŋu awɔ gbeɖe o.
That passive thing continued.	Nu ma si mewɔa naneke o la yi edzi.
Thousands of times.	Zi akpe geɖe.
I want this.	Medi esia.
It might be very useful.	Ðewohĩ aɖe vi ŋutɔ.
He didn’t do it.	Mewɔe o.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Many men came out.	Ŋutsu geɖe va do.
He knew nothing more.	Menya nu bubu aɖeke wu ema o.
Go away!	Dzo le afima!
A really long shot.	Tu didi ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe.
This very place where we are now is a city.	Teƒe sia tututu si míele fifia la nye du.
Hope you are doing well.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be èle edzi dzem nyuie.
Almost everyone hates them.	Ame sia ame kloe lé fu wo.
I don’t want that either.	Nye hã nyemedi nenema o.
Which could be a bad thing.	Nusi ate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ.
It is important to keep this in mind.	Ele vevie be nya sia nanɔ susu me na mí.
I did that for me more for any other reason.	Mewɔ ema nam wu le susu bubu ɖesiaɖe ta.
No one has anything.	Naneke mele ame aɖeke si o.
We really don’t know much.	Le nyateƒe me la, míenya nu geɖe o.
Like someone had been waiting.	Abe alesi ame aɖe nɔ lalam tsã ene.
He definitely sang better.	Edzi ha nyuie wu godoo.
Missed you for a few weeks.	Mesusu wò kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo.
He has someone else.	Ame bubu aɖe hã le esi.
If you don’t have time, it’s another thing.	Ne ɣeyiɣi le asiwò o, enye nu bubu.
He lost his job.	Dɔ ge le esi.
And not without reason.	Eye menye susu aɖeke manɔmee o.
I don't know what's wrong with him.	Nyemenya nusi le fu ɖem nɛ o.
One of these days.	Ŋkeke siawo dometɔ ɖeka.
He can’t tell me where he’s going.	Mate ŋu agblɔ afi si yim wòle nam o.
This is simply not true .	Ðeko esia menye nyateƒe o .
Build this house in your mind.	Tu aƒe sia ɖe wò susu me.
Otherwise, we have what we have.	Ne menye nenema o la, nu si le mía si la le mía si.
He wanted nothing more to do with her.	Medi be yeawɔ naneke kplii wu ema o.
Take the money.	Xɔ ga la.
He couldn’t promise.	Mete ŋu do ŋugbe o.
But it was a great place.	Gake teƒe gã aɖee wònye.
I can get away with quite a few things.	Mate ŋu asi le nu ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ me.
It was a perfect fit for him in a way.	Enye nusi sɔ nyuie nɛ le mɔ aɖe nu.
Some things were more important.	Nu aɖewo nɔ vevie wu.
I like everything about it.	Nusianu si ku ɖe eŋu la dzɔa dzi nam.
However, it’s not impossible.	Ke hã, menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o ye o.
But tell me about you.	Ke gblɔ wò ŋu nya nam.
In a strange place.	Le teƒe aɖe si mewɔ nuku o.
Get his name out of there.	Ðe eƒe ŋkɔ ɖa le afima.
The word won’t come to him.	Nya la mava nɛ o.
He couldn't look at them.	Mete ŋu kpɔ ŋku ɖe wo ŋu o.
Nothing costs anything.	Naneke mexɔ asi na naneke o.
But this is something different.	Gake esia nye nusi to vovo.
Again, too long .	Le afisia hã la, didi akpa .
Now live it up!.	Azɔ nɔ agbe ɖe enu!.
Just tell me what’s going on with you.	Ðeko nàgblɔ nusi le edzi yim le ŋuwò la nam.
But this is an expensive issue.	Gake esia nye nya si xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Maria sang well.	Maria dzi ha nyuie.
I have no other real joy.	Dzidzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ bubu aɖeke mele asinye o.
This is in contrast to other nearby towns.	Esia to vovo na du bubu siwo te ɖe afima ŋu.
Obviously, that may not be the case.	Edze ƒã be ɖewohĩ manɔ nenema o.
That’s why we’re here.	Esia tae míele afisia ɖo.
There was so much to do.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi woawɔ.
This time is different.	Ɣeyiɣi sia to vovo.
A very little bit.	Vi aɖe ŋutɔ.
This is something new to me.	Esia nye nu yeye nam.
That is not true at all.	Ema menye nyateƒe kura o.
And look at the bright side.	Eye kpɔ akpa si me kɔ la ɖa.
Money is a form of money.	Ga nye ga ƒomevi aɖe.
Please focus on the tasks at hand.	Taflatse lé fɔ ɖe dɔ siwo le asiwò la ŋu.
It looked empty, and he didn’t put anything into it.	Ewɔ abe ɖe naneke mele eme o ene, eye metsɔ naneke de eme o.
This must have been a mistake!	Esia anya nye vodada!
He seemed surprised.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ ene.
Maybe, in a few years, maybe there was a way.	Ðewohĩ, le ƒe ʋɛ aɖewo megbe la, ɖewohĩ mɔ aɖe nɔ anyi.
My car is out.	Nye ʋua do.
Maybe it will take until tomorrow.	Ðewohĩ axɔ vaseɖe etsɔ.
Write as much as you want.	Ŋlɔ agbalẽ alesi nèdi.
I can do the same thing.	Nye hã mate ŋu awɔ nu ma ke.
This part is very important.	Akpa sia le vevie ŋutɔ.
I want to sort things out.	Medi be makpɔ nuwo gbɔ.
There may be circumstances where this is not the case.	Nɔnɔme aɖewo ate ŋu anɔ anyi siwo me esia manɔ nenema o.
But please, be careful.	Gake taflatse, kpɔ nyuie.
I guess that’s me though.	Mesusu be nyee nye ema ke hã.
That means no private schools.	Ema fia be suku aɖeke meli si menye ame ŋutɔ tɔ o.
But it is necessary.	Gake ehiã.
We all already know this.	Mí katã míenya esia xoxo.
He had a house there.	Aƒe nɔ esi le afima.
He didn’t seem to have much else to do.	Edze abe nu bubu geɖe menɔ esi wòawɔ o ene.
I couldn’t in the past.	Nyemate ŋui le ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me o.
There was no escape house.	Aƒe aɖeke menɔ anyi si ate ŋu asi le o.
But something bothered him.	Gake nane ɖe fu nɛ.
He has two of them.	Wo dometɔ eve le esi.
There was nothing on his face.	Nu aɖeke medze le eƒe mo o.
That couldn’t have been easy.	Ema mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe hafi o.
Many men are divided on this subject.	Ŋutsu geɖe ƒe susu me ma le nya sia ŋu.
I’ve got you.	Mexɔ wò.
This is a very large fortress.	Esia nye mɔ̃ sesẽ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
First time disappeared.	Ɣeyiɣi gbãtɔ bu.
Which, come to think of it, is.	Nusi, va bu eŋu kpɔ, enye.
It just never worked out that way.	Ðeko wòwɔ dɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
He can talk, too.	Eya hã ate ŋu aƒo nu.
It is very personal.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ ŋutɔ.
Your job, my man.	Wò dɔ, nye ame.
And his point is simple.	Eye eƒe nya la le bɔbɔe.
I missed myself a lot.	Mesusu ɖokuinye ŋutɔ.
I never wanted you, you know.	Nyemedi wò kpɔ o, ènya.
Use what you think will work best.	Zã nusi nèsusu be awɔ dɔ nyuie wu.
And a little bit too.	Eye sue aɖe hã.
He didn’t answer.	Meɖo eŋu o.
I can’t accept this.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nya sia o.
We have to do this every morning!.	Ele be míawɔ esia ŋdi sia ŋdi!.
This is a nice house.	Aƒe nyui aɖee nye esia.
He laughed too, for no good reason.	Eya hã ko nu, le susu nyui aɖeke ta o.
It doesn’t make sense.	Susu mele eme o.
What he had just done was simply impossible.	Ðeko nusi wòwɔ teti koe nye ema la mate ŋu adzɔ o.
He didn’t touch anything.	Meka asi naneke ŋu o.
They had many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe nɔ wo si.
A lot of things happened.	Nu geɖe dzɔ.
Make a plan for yourself.	Wɔ ɖoɖo aɖe na wò.
He never did that to me.	Mewɔ nu ma nam kpɔ o.
But this requires something.	Gake esia bia nane.
With your help or die.	Le wò kpekpeɖeŋu me alo ku.
Only the pure in heart can guard it.	Ame siwo ƒe dzi me kɔ la koe ate ŋu adzɔ eŋu.
But now the mansion is in ruins.	Gake fifia xɔ gã la gblẽ.
Listen!	Ɖo to!
It’s a great little project.	Enye dɔ sue gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But I’m not so sure.	Gake nyemeka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o.
The dead in a hurry.	Ame kuku siwo le du dzi.
He had a lot of work to do.	Dɔ geɖe nɔ esi wòawɔ.
I’m glad they’re actually having fun together.	Edzɔ dzi nam be wole dzidzɔ kpɔm ɖekae ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Offer more schools if necessary.	Na suku geɖe wu ne ehiã.
There is no better time than now.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli si nyo wu fifia o.
Neither of them seemed interested in the thread.	Edze abe wo dometɔ aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le ka la me o ene.
Hold it tightly.	Lé eme nyuie.
We have a word for this.	Nya aɖe le mía si na esia.
He never fell down.	Medze anyi kpɔ o.
They are working well.	Wole dɔ wɔm nyuie.
We have to do things right.	Ele be míawɔ nuwo nyuie.
In some cases, there are similarities.	Le go aɖewo me la, nɔnɔme aɖewo sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
We were never like that.	Míenye nenema gbeɖe o.
That wasn’t easy.	Ema menɔ bɔbɔe o.
Things are different here now.	Nuwo to vovo le afisia fifia.
The job you will do.	Dɔ si nàwɔ.
That happened before.	Ema dzɔ do ŋgɔ.
The horse died.	Sɔ la ku.
That’s not a problem.	Ema menye kuxi aɖeke o.
I think eventually something will be done about it.	Mesusu be mlɔeba la, woawɔ nane tso eŋu.
I was hoping that.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be.
Now it looks like any other house.	Fifia edze abe aƒe bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
I pretty much gave up on that.	Meɖe asi le nya ma ŋu tututu.
For the sake of his people.	Le eƒe amewo ta.
This year will probably be the same.	Anɔ eme be ƒe sia hã anɔ nenema.
He didn’t ask what happened to her.	Mebia nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi o.
He can’t control it.	Mate ŋu aɖu edzi o.
Just for now.	Fifia ya ko.
I told him that.	Megblɔ nɛ nenema.
I am committed to my work.	Metsɔ ɖokuinye na nye dɔa.
This is nothing like that.	Esia menye naneke si le abe ema ene o.
I was just getting started.	Ðeko medze egɔme teti koe nye ema.
At this time now.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me fifia.
Write to you from there.	Ŋlɔ agbalẽ na wò tso afima.
To some extent, this is not surprising.	Vaseɖe afi aɖe la, esia mewɔ nuku o.
It is too convenient.	Enye nusi sɔ akpa.
Again, just that.	Le afisia hã la, ema ko.
That costs a lot of money.	Ema xɔa ga geɖe.
I was very surprised.	Mewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
Clearly, he was kind.	Edze ƒã be ewɔ nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu nyuie.
There is no way.	Mɔ aɖeke meli o.
And this is more than that.	Eye esia de ŋgɔ wu ema.
Try these things.	Te nu siawo kpɔ.
I was in my head.	Menɔ nye ta me.
Just another year.	Ƒe bubu aɖe ko.
And in this way, too.	Eye le mɔ sia hã nu.
A party has attitude.	Nɔnɔme le akpa aɖe si.
And a great many of them don’t.	Eye wo dometɔ geɖe ŋutɔ mewɔa esia o.
Tell them that, anyway.	Gblɔ wo nenema, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
The following statements.	Nya siwo gbɔna.
Perhaps this will appeal to you.	Ðewohĩ esia ado dzidzɔ na wò.
Which is a lot of things.	Nusi nye nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
It is life after death.	Enye agbe le ku megbe.
Say goodbye to him from us.	Do gbe nɛ tso mía gbɔ.
It doesn’t matter, you know.	Mehiã o, ènya.
The job is not easy.	Dɔa mele bɔbɔe o.
I book into them and that's it.	Mewɔa agbalẽ ɖe wo me eye emae nye ema.
He couldn’t go home.	Mete ŋu yi aƒeme o.
It was part of the afternoon.	Ŋdɔ ƒe akpa aɖee nye ema.
And that means a lot to me.	Eye ema fia nu geɖe nam.
Very little of the car was missing.	Ʋua ƒe akpa sue aɖe koe bu.
But that he didn’t know if anyone left with him.	Gake be menya ne ame aɖe dzo kplii o.
It’s as simple as that.	Ele bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
There are many rooms in his house.	Xɔ geɖe le eƒe aƒea me.
That seems difficult.	Edze abe ema sesẽ ene.
What is this? 	Nukae nye esia?
He was fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
And that’s a big deal.	Eye nya gã aɖee nye ema.
It was a shock to the people there.	Ewɔ nuku na ame siwo nɔ afi ma la ŋutɔ.
That is very important to us.	Ema le vevie na mí ŋutɔ.
It’s all on its own.	Wo katã le eɖokui si.
We are usually well informed.	Zi geɖe la, míenya nu nyuie.
One person died.	Ame ɖeka ku.
I have never had this problem before and I am very surprised.	Kuxi sia medze dzinye kpɔ o eye wòwɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
We can get a good deal.	Míate ŋu akpɔ nu nyui aɖe.
But he made a mistake.	Gake ewɔ vodada.
But for us, today they are hard to find.	Gake le mía ta la, egbea wo didi sesẽ.
But that’s not really the fun part.	Gake menye emae nye akpa si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Its just that I am having some fun.	Eƒe ɖeka koe nye be mele dzidzɔ aɖewo kpɔm.
You can do this, too.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia hã.
I need to talk to you.	Ehiã be maƒo nu kpli wò.
I’ve never felt that way before.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o.
My room is always warm.	Nye xɔ me xɔa dzo ɣesiaɣi.
I know you better than that.	Menya wò nyuie wu ema.
But there is still plenty of winter.	Gake dzomeŋɔli geɖe gakpɔtɔ li.
He took his time there.	Etsɔ eƒe ɣeyiɣi va va afima.
I'm sure you can do it.	Meka ɖe edzi be àte ŋu awɔe.
A search plan is needed.	Didi ƒe ɖoɖo aɖe hiã.
He doesn’t have a heart.	Dzi mele esi o.
But on this one.	Gake le esia ŋu la.
It was just a happy place.	Teƒe si me dzidzɔ le koe wònye.
This night had been different.	Zã sia to vovo tsã.
This may not surprise you.	Ðewohĩ esia mawɔ nuku na wò o.

Now, it’s personal.	Fifia, enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
I just couldn’t believe myself.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu xɔ ɖokuinye dzi se o.
And eventually it will kill you.	Eye mlɔeba la, awu wò.
Too much going on, too much to do.	Nu geɖe akpa le edzi yim, nu geɖe akpa si woawɔ.
It was a pleasure to see them.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be mekpɔ wo.
It is just what it is.	Nusi wònye koe wònye.
Was it nothing of the sort.	Ðe menye naneke si ƒomevi wònye oa.
They are alive in us.	Wole agbe le mía me.
A good attitude is good.	Nɔnɔme nyui nyo.
There are still a lot of people out there talking.	Ame geɖe gakpɔtɔ le afima le nu ƒom.
Maybe a week late.	Ðewohĩ kwasiɖa ɖeka tsi megbe.
That will do it for me.	Ema awɔe nam.
I have my own car.	Nye ŋutɔ nye ʋu le asinye.
He is working for someone else.	Ele dɔ wɔm na ame bubu aɖe.
I would do something like that.	Mawɔ nu aɖe abe ema ene.
Or it could be someone else entirely.	Alo ate ŋu anye ame bubu kura.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I'm not sure what to do with that reality.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi woawɔ kple nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ma dzi o.

Quite the opposite, I think.	Mesusu be nusi to vovo kura na emae.
One horn fell.	Dzo ɖeka dze anyi.

Or at his gun.	Alo le eƒe tu la gbɔ.

No blood, no bones, no nothing.	Ʋu aɖeke meli o, ƒu aɖeke meli o, naneke meli o.

He wouldn’t tell me much.	Magblɔ nya boo aɖeke nam o.

There was no tea on it.	Te aɖeke menɔ anyi ɖe edzi o.

There’s nothing he doesn’t know now.	Naneke meli si menya o fifia o.
In every respect.	Le go sia go me.
Have this handy when you work.	Na esia nanɔ asiwò ne èle dɔ wɔm.
It seemed to them that the work was not unreasonable.	Edze na wo be dɔa menye nusi me susu mele o.
Now, he's finally doing something.	Fifia, ele nane wɔm mlɔeba.
It seems highly unlikely.	Edze abe ɖe mate ŋu adzɔ kura o ene.
A law is not going to tell you that.	Se aɖe mele nya ma gblɔ ge na wò o.
This will not stand.	Esia manɔ te o.
That book is amazing.	Agbalẽ ma wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This rarely works.	Ƒã hafi esia wɔa dɔ.
Tell people what’s going on.	Gblɔ nusi le edzi yim la na amewo.
Every hand on me.	Asi ɖesiaɖe ɖe ŋunye.
But he didn’t seem to care.	Gake edze abe metsɔ ɖeke le eme o ene.
Which is just good.	Nusi nyo ko.
And food for two thousand years.	Eye nuɖuɖu ƒe akpe eve.
It’s a great place to work.	Enye teƒe nyui aɖe si woawɔ dɔ le.
There has to be someone else.	Ele be ame bubu nanɔ anyi.
There is no problem.	Kuxi aɖeke meli o.
That is not true either.	Ema hã menye nyateƒe o.
You have to tell me what’s going on here.	Ele be nàgblɔ nusi le edzi yim le afisia nam.
We have to do something.	Ele be míawɔ nane.
And about us, too.	Eye le mía ŋu hã.
One city to another.	Du ɖeka yi du me.
We didn’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke menɔ mía si o.
I was just getting started.	Ðeko medze egɔme teti koe nye ema.
That is very good for them.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ na wo ŋutɔ.
All of these things can be true at the same time.	Nu siawo katã ate ŋu anye nyateƒe le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
Something has to be done about it tomorrow.	Ele be woawɔ nane tso eŋu etsɔ.
He quickly came to her aid.	Ewɔ kaba va kpe ɖe eŋu.
I was looking for something like this.	Menɔ nane si le abe esia ene dim.
He is alive now.	Ele agbe fifia.
This is a very good one.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ.
I'm not sure what this will do though.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi esia awɔ dzi o ke hã.
You have to make a plan.	Ele be nàwɔ ɖoɖo aɖe.
Not at any point in time.	Menye le ɣeyiɣi aɖeke me o.
Maybe in a thousand years.	Ðewohĩ le ƒe akpe ɖeka megbe.
It seems to have impressed many.	Edze abe ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame geɖe dzi ene.
He was just a different kind of person.	Ame ƒomevi bubu aɖe koe wònye.
This is a little closer to home.	Esia te ɖe aƒe ŋu vie.
Too many people.	Ame geɖe akpa.
He seemed satisfied.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme ene.
This isn’t the only issue.	Menye nya sia koe o.
But he couldn’t stay in the house.	Gake mete ŋu nɔ aƒea me o.
Just like at this very moment.	Abe alesi wòle le ɣeyiɣi sia tututu me ene.
I enjoy doing that.	Ema wɔwɔ dzɔa dzi nam.
Saved so many people.	Ðe ame geɖe ale gbegbe.
This is appropriate.	Esia sɔ.
I want everyone to have something for tomorrow.	Medi be nane nanɔ amesiame si na etsɔ.
Everything else is still here.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe gakpɔtɔ le afisia.
And it isn’t at all.	Eye menye nenema kura o.
You can’t do it.	Màte ŋu awɔe o.
These buildings occupied this site for many years.	Xɔ siawo xɔ teƒe sia ƒe geɖe.
Again, this is not surprising.	Le afisia hã la, esia mewɔ nuku o.
And that takes a little time.	Eye ema bia ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe.
What a great place for a fortress.	Teƒe gã kae nye si na mɔ̃ sesẽ aɖe.
I stayed there for a year.	Menɔ afima ƒe ɖeka.
Write as you please.	Ŋlɔ nu alesi nèdi.
You think you can do anything!.	Èsusu be yeate ŋu awɔ nusianu!.
It wasn’t like this before that night.	Menɔ alea do ŋgɔ na zã ma o.
We have to do something.	Ele be míawɔ nane.
How long will this take?	Ɣeyiɣi didi kae esia axɔ?
I know my hair.	Menya nye ɖa.
Nothing seems to be going his way.	Edze abe naneke mele edzi yim le eƒe mɔ nu o ene.
Relax in that.	Gbɔ ɖe eme le ema me.
His mind changed completely.	Eƒe susu trɔ kura.
Not sure what this means.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi esia fia dzi o.
Use that time.	Zã ɣeyiɣi ma.
No one will come.	Ame aɖeke mava o.
You should, too.	Ele be wò hã.
That sounds pretty good.	Ema ɖi nya nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
What exactly that meant, he wasn’t sure.	Nusi tututu ema fia la, meka ɖe edzi o.
This is something we all have.	Esia nye nusi le mía katã si.
It’s been a while.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
I explained it to them and that was that.	Meɖe eme na wo eye emae nye ema.
It’s all there is to our side.	Eya koe nye nusi li na míaƒe akpa dzi.
He was just showing off.	Ðeko wònɔ eɖokui ɖem fia.
He wasn’t like her.	Menɔ abe eya ene o.
It’s going to take some time, you know.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe, ènya.
You can’t escape your own time.	Màte ŋu asi le wò ŋutɔ wò ɣeyiɣi nu o.
Within a few hours he would be fine.	Le gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo ko me la, eƒe lãme anɔ nyuie.
And years will pass.	Eye ƒe geɖe ava yi.
I can’t live without this device right now.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe mɔ̃ sia manɔmee fifia o.
Not that at all.	Menye ema kura o.
It hurt all over his face.	Eve eƒe mo katã.
I was very interested in it.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme vevie.
This building used to be a school.	Xɔ sia nye suku tsã.
There is no money for you.	Ga aɖeke meli na wò o.
I could feel like he was there.	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me abe ɖe wòle afima ene.
There’s something about it, it’s almost like normal.	Nane le eme, ele abe nusi sɔ gbɔ kloe ene.
Nothing seems to matter much now.	Edze abe naneke mele vevie boo fifia o ene.
It seems not so long ago.	Edze abe menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia o ene.
It’s just about ready.	Ðeko wòle klalo kloe.
It deserves more than that.	Edze nam wu ema.
Looks like it is too.	Dze abe ɖe wòle nenema hã ene.
Maybe some water will help.	Ðewohĩ tsi aɖe akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I was that surprised.	Mewɔ nuku nenema.
It seems a little too simple.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe akpa vie ene.
No one knows that.	Ame aɖeke menya nya ma o.
Someone like.	Ame aɖe abe.
That’s nice and clear.	Ema nyo eye eme kɔ.
The leg was still there.	Afɔ la gakpɔtɔ nɔ afima.
The case lasted a few months.	Nya la xɔ ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo.
That was a mistake.	Vodada aɖee nye ema.
But this is not true.	Gake esia ya menye nyateƒe o.
It didn’t start well.	Medze egɔme nyuie o.
This problem is already very difficult.	Kuxi sia sesẽ ŋutɔ xoxo.
Everyone was very happy.	Amesiame kpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
Somewhere he wasn’t before.	Le afi aɖe si menɔ tsã o.
It seems that	Edze abe .
I'm sure, like me.	Meka ɖe edzi, abe nye ene.
Many people gave up.	Ame geɖe na ta.
Something else is wrong.	Nu bubu aɖe hã gblẽ.
This is a pretty big deal.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Perhaps there is an opportunity.	Ðewohĩ mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe li.
We know a lot about that now.	Míenya nu geɖe tso ema ŋu fifia.
There was no food in the house.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke menɔ aƒea me o.
They have no logic in them.	Susu aɖeke mele wo si le wo me o.
And it’s amazing.	Eye ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Amesiame nya be anɔ afima.
I need to find some time to talk to you.	Ele be makpɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe aƒo nu kpli wò.
If it works for them .	Ne ewɔ dɔ na wo la .
I just didn’t know what to do.	Ðeko nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
It’s not just a machine.	Menye mɔ̃ aɖe ko o.
I came here yesterday.	Meva afisia etsɔ.
And it’s not here either.	Eye mele afisia hã o.
A bad thing.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
Food is better there.	Nuɖuɖu nyo wu le afima.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
We have no children.	Vi aɖeke mele mía si o.
But if the.	Gake nenye be.
And it didn’t come.	Eye meva o.
And that’s all there is.	Eye ema koe nye nusi li.
We have nothing against him.	Naneke mele mía si ɖe eŋu o.
You can continue now.	Àte ŋu ayi edzi fifia.
In some cases.	Le go aɖewo me la.
We will work with you.	Míawɔ dɔ kpli wò.
A nice solid gun.	Tu sesẽ nyui aɖe.
But I couldn’t find it.	Gake nyemete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
I almost met him.	Medo go kloe.
Few people have ever heard of it.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe se nu tso eŋu kpɔ.
It’s not enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
Now you know where you are.	Fifia ènya afi si nèle.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I did the same thing.	Nye hã mewɔe nenema ke.
He showed them to his car.	Etsɔ wo fia eƒe ʋua.
It could have been someone.	Ate ŋu anye ame aɖe hafi.
Not now, anyway.	Menye fifia o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Each bite is better than the last.	Nuɖuɖu ɖesiaɖe nyo wu mamlɛtɔ.
There is no room for error in this project.	Vodada ƒe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke mele dɔ sia me o.
He must have gotten his attention.	Anɔ eme be eƒe susu va nɔ eŋu.
Suddenly, much joy returned.	Zi ɖeka la, dzidzɔ geɖe trɔ gbɔ ake.
Which means there are no surprises.	Nusi fia be nu aɖeke meli si awɔ nuku na ame o.
He couldn’t believe what he was seeing.	Mete ŋu xɔ nusi kpɔm wònɔ la dzi se o.
Everything is going well.	Nusianu le edzi yim nyuie.
Busy.	Le dɔ wɔm.
I understand that it is necessary.	Mese egɔme be ehiã.
What’s wrong with it?	Nukae gblẽ le eŋu?
Left his own life in this.	Gblẽ eya ŋutɔ ƒe agbe ɖi le esia me.
Everything has to be done right.	Ele be woawɔ nusianu nyuie.
Still, it’s a good point.	Ke hã, nya nyui aɖee.
Let him do his job.	Na wòawɔ eƒe dɔ.
If anyone can help me.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye la.
It’s just a necessary condition.	Nɔnɔme aɖe si hiã koe wònye.
I don’t want to live in this city.	Nyemedi be manɔ du sia me o.
In fact, it’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I was very pleased with it.   	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.   
I would be the same.	Nye hã manɔ nenema ke.
I couldn’t be closer.	Nyemate ŋu ate ɖe eŋu wu ema o.
Let me explain why this is not the case.	Mina maɖe nu si tae mele alea o la me na mi.
I shared them with very few people.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe megblɔ wo na.
Actually, it never was.	Le nyateƒe me la, menɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
This is due to the high concentration of people.	Esia tso alesi amewo ƒoa ƒu ɖe afima ŋutɔ gbɔ.
This was very impressive in my mind.	Esia wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ le nye susu me.
Is that still happening today.	Ðe ema gakpɔtɔ le edzi yim egbea.
Your room is ready.	Wò xɔ la le klalo.
I hope it works for you!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ na wò!.
I became seriously ill.	Meva dze dɔ vevie.
Not sure when, but be ready.	Nyemeka ɖe ɣekaɣie dzi o, gake nɔ klalo.

Now continue with your work.	Azɔ yi wò dɔa dzi.
I know you are making one.	Menya be ɖeka wɔm nèle.
There was something before that.	Nane nɔ anyi do ŋgɔ na ema.
That has changed.	Ema trɔ.
I don’t really know what that means.	Nyemenya nusi tututu nya ma fia o.
We are like that.	Míele nenema.
He did a very good job.	Ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I don’t know what he expects.	Nyemenya nusi wòle mɔ kpɔm na o.
Something is going on here.	Nane le edzi yim le afisia.
There are some great people out there.	Ame gã aɖewo le afima.
This was not his fault at all.	Esia menye eƒe vodada kura o.
That just wouldn’t work.	Ðeko ema mawɔ dɔ o.
He is trying really hard.	Ele agbagba dzem vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
What year is he now?	Ƒe kae wònye fifia?
I am right here.	Mele afisia tututu.
This is not realistic.	Esia menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He has two of them.	Wo dometɔ eve le eŋu.
Freedom in things.	Vovo le nuwo me.
It was a very small thing.	Enye nu sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
This is easy to achieve.	Esia dzi ɖoɖo le bɔbɔe.
It was the most beautiful house ever.	Enye aƒe si nya kpɔ wu ɖesiaɖe kpɔ.
Buy a house.	Ƒle aƒe aɖe.
It won’t work.	Mawɔ dɔ o.
It would be a great thing.	Anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
In addition to the money.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe ga la ŋu.
It’s not me.	Menye nyee o.
Leave this alone for now.	Gblẽ esia ɖi fifia.
I was able to cope with it.	Mete ŋu do dzi le eme.
There’s just something between us.	Nu aɖe koe le mía dome.
I couldn’t find one.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeka ŋu o.
But maybe it’s something else.	Gake ɖewohĩ nu bubu aɖee.
Every word was very important to him.	Nya ɖesiaɖe nɔ vevie nɛ ŋutɔ.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
The thing will happen.	Nu la ava eme.
He did everything he could to help her.	Ewɔ nusianu si wòate ŋui tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu.
It’s not good at all.	Mele nyuie kura o.
Or indeed, who is fighting with whom and where.	Alo le nyateƒe me la, amekae le avu wɔm kple amesi kple afisi wòle.
Something caught my eye.	Nane lé nye ŋku.
Think for yourself what the truth is.	Wò ŋutɔ bu nusi nyateƒea nye ŋu.
It all just happened too soon.	Ðeko nusianu dzɔ kaba akpa.
There is a job.	Dɔ aɖe li.
I am a man	Nye ame .
I'll see you tomorrow.	Makpɔ wò etsɔ.
I like that word.	Nya ma dzɔa dzi nam.
If they keep it here.	Ne wole edzi le afisia.
It can feel weird.	Ate ŋu ase le eɖokui me be ewɔ nuku.
Everyone here is on to something.	Amesiame le afisia le nane ŋu.
But it didn’t last long.	Gake menɔ anyi didi o.
I have never seen this before.	Nyemekpɔ esia kpɔ o.
There has to be a better way.	Ele be mɔ si nyo wu nanɔ anyi.
It’s a reality now.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ fifia.
It will be a matter of life and death.	Anye agbe kple ku ƒe nya.
He worked very hard, probably harder than anyone, in this process.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe ŋutɔ, ɖewohĩ ewɔ dɔ sesĩe wu amesiame, le ɖoɖo sia me.
I don’t think that’s what he has in mind.	Nyemesusu be emae nye nusi le susu me nɛ o.
I want no part of it.	Medi be eƒe akpa aɖeke mele eme o.
The last part quite often.	Akpa mamlɛtɔ zi geɖe ŋutɔ.
It’s just one of many things.	Nu geɖe dometɔ ɖeka koe wònye.
No one will say anything.	Ame aɖeke magblɔ nya aɖeke o.
This should not surprise us.	Mele be esia nawɔ nuku na mí o.
I am the voice of reason.	Nyee nye susu ƒe gbe.
His work, of course, suffered.	Eƒe dɔa kpe fu ya.
But no one knows how much.	Gake ame aɖeke menya alesi gbegbe wònye o.
Everyone has a past.	Nusi dzɔ va yi le amesiame si.
It will be very popular.	Axɔ ŋkɔ ŋutɔ.
Please make it work for them.	Taflatse na wòawɔ dɔ na wo.
He wasn’t as nervous as he used to be.	Metsi dzodzodzoe abe tsã ene o.
Mary was always late for her appointment.	Mary tsi megbe ɣesiaɣi le eƒe kpekpea me.
People are more productive now than they used to be.	Amewo le dɔ wɔm nyuie fifia wu alesi wònɔ tsã.
It’s a huge challenge.	Enye kuxi gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But some things are pretty good.	Gake nu aɖewo nyo ŋutɔ.
One has many hearts.	Ame ɖeka ƒe dzi geɖe le esi.
But everything changed.	Gake nusianu trɔ.
These machines are excellent.	Mɔ̃ siawo nyo ŋutɔ.
Paradoxically, it is not working.	Nusi to vovo na emae nye be mele dɔ wɔm o.
That’s a lot for me.	Ema nye nu geɖe nam.
I looked away.	Meɖe ŋku ɖa.
He will know what to do.	Anya nusi wòawɔ.
I had no one to go with.	Ame aɖeke menɔ asinye si mayi kplii o.

I ask if we can see things differently.	Mebia be míate ŋu akpɔ nuwo le mɔ bubu nu.
I was surprised several times.	Ewɔ nuku nam zi geɖe.
In fact, that is impossible.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Actually, you can’t do it now anyway.	Le nyateƒe me la, màte ŋu awɔe fifia le mɔ sia mɔ nu o.
It doesn’t matter in the end.	Mehiã vevie mlɔeba o.
I couldn’t figure out what was in it.	Nyemete ŋu nya nusi nɔ eme o.
I think maybe that’s what’s wrong with me.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ emae nye nusi gblẽ le ŋunye.
And it worked for me.	Eye ewɔ dɔ nam.
I never understood it.	Nyemese egɔme kpɔ o.
But in the end, the project fell apart.	Gake mlɔeba la, dɔa va gblẽ.
This is very close.	Esia te ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu ŋutɔ.
I still have a fire.	Dzo aɖe gakpɔtɔ le asinye.
Some of them are small.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo le sue.
It was a kind of death.	Enye ku ƒomevi aɖe.
He had very few people.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ esi.
That’s it, your finished.	Emae nye ema, wò wu enu.
But perhaps more should.	Gake ɖewohĩ ele be wo dometɔ geɖe wu.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
I am on my own now.	Mele ɖokuinye dzi fifia.
I doubt if they will do much.	Meke ɖi nenye be woawɔ nu geɖe.
It’s not expensive.	Mexɔ asi o.
Everything was fine and easy again.	Nusianu nyo eye wònɔ bɔbɔe ake.
Or a lot of water.	Alo tsi geɖe.
He wasn’t expecting anything.	Menye ɖe wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na nane o.
It’s really simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Everything is very important.	Nu ɖesiaɖe le vevie ŋutɔ.
But he won’t do it.	Gake mawɔe o.
I tried my best to get rid of them, but it didn’t work.	Medze agbagba ɖesiaɖe be maɖe wo ɖa, gake mewɔ dɔ o.
And not too often.	Eye menye zi geɖe akpa o.
We can talk about it.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu.
I couldn’t do anything for him.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nu nɛ o.
You can fight fire.	Àte ŋu awɔ avu kple dzo.
Free to work here.	Vovo le dɔ wɔm le afisia.
They have one car.	Ʋu ɖeka le wo si.
On my own.	Le ɖokuinye si.

There was another problem.	Kuxi bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.

I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.

Again, I didn’t like it though.	Azɔ hã, nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu o ke hã.

I'm sure that would be great.	Meka ɖe edzi be ema anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Everyone fought each other.	Amesiame wɔ avu kple wo nɔewo.
I think you will enjoy it.	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ.
It is a very difficult challenge.	Enye kuxi sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
I resisted it.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu.
Someone else got involved.	Ame bubu aɖe hã ge ɖe eme.
Maybe someone else can.	Ðewohĩ ame bubu aɖe ate ŋui.
I felt and felt bad.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye lãme gblẽ eye mese le ɖokuinye me.
About the money.	Le ga la ŋu.
It’s not like it’s the same.	Menye abe ale si wòle ene o.
Each carried a small object.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe tsɔ nu sue aɖe ɖe asi.
In fact, it’s quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo kura na ema.
It is a good book.	Agbalẽ nyui aɖee wònye.
It can happen at any age.	Ate ŋu adzɔ le ƒe ɖesiaɖe me.
I'll tell him something.	Magblɔ nya aɖe nɛ.
And maybe he knows what it was like.	Eye ɖewohĩ anya alesi wònɔ.
He never believed me.	Mexɔ dzinye se kpɔ o.
I understand, no problem.	Mese egɔme, kuxi aɖeke meli o.
I couldn’t face any of them.	Nyemete ŋu dze ŋgɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
And he was focused on it.	Eye eƒe susu nɔ eŋu.

I came behind him.	Meva le megbe nɛ.
I have a voice.	Gbe le asinye.
It doesn’t do anything for you.	Mewɔa naneke na wò o.
Some money is better than no money.	Ga aɖewo nyo wu ga aɖeke manɔmee.
Not on this basis.	Menye ɖe esia dzi o.
I was planning my life.	Menɔ ɖoɖo wɔm ɖe nye agbe ŋu.

Two eyes are better than one.	Ŋku eve nyo wu ɖeka.

I need to have a clear head.	Ele be ta si me kɔ nyuie nanɔ asinye.

People must have been watching us.	Anɔ eme be amewo nɔ mía kpɔm.

They’re in real time.	Wole ɣeyiɣi ŋutɔŋutɔ me.
This is about doing something else.	Esia ku ɖe nu bubu aɖe wɔwɔ ŋu.
He hurried to work.	Ewɔ kaba yi dɔme.
In some ways, this is nothing new.	Le mɔ aɖewo nu la, esia menye nu yeye o.
And we didn’t have that.	Eye ema menɔ mía si o.
We could go on for a long time.	Míate ŋu ayi edzi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.

Honestly, I saw too much.	Le nyateƒe me la, mekpɔ nu geɖe akpa.
I couldn’t feel anything either.	Nye hã nyemete ŋu se naneke le ɖokuinye me o.
In some cases, it certainly is.	Le go aɖewo me la, anɔ eme godoo.
That would work just fine.	Ema awɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
I don’t know what’s good.	Nyemenya nu si nyo o.
We have to do something.	Ele be míawɔ nane.
That’s what you need to do.	Emae nye nusi wòle be nàwɔ.
This will be exciting.	Esia ado dzidzɔ na ame.
This car is easy to drive.	Ʋu sia kuku le bɔbɔe.
He will definitely come.	Ava godoo.
It was a real building.	Enye xɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe.
That’s a big part of it.	Ema nye eƒe akpa gã aɖe.
But he won’t do it.	Gake mawɔe o.
That’s our strategy.	Emae nye míaƒe aɖaŋu.
Chances are you know a few.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ li be ènya ʋɛ aɖewo.
I really don’t know what else to say.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nya bubu si magblɔ o.
I fixed my eyes on someone else.	Metsɔ nye ŋku ɖo ame bubu aɖe ŋu.
Spring has finally arrived.	Dzomeŋɔli va ɖo mlɔeba.
We could really do with some other food.	Míate ŋu awɔe kple nuɖuɖu bubu aɖewo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He can win with dignity.	Ate ŋu aɖu dzi le bubu me.
That probably won’t bother us.	Anɔ eme be nya ma maɖe fu na mí o.
Still, he kind of liked it.	Ke hã, edzɔ dzi nɛ le mɔ aɖe nu.
And, lastly, remember this.	Eye, mamlɛtɔ, ɖo ŋku esia dzi.
Smoke came out of many fires.	Dzudzɔ do tso dzo geɖe me.
That’s what’s so interesting.	Emae nye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
Everyone kind of was.	Amesiame ƒomevi nɔ.
He wasn't happy, but there was nothing he could do.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ o, gake naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ o.
In fact, it’s the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo na ema.
Come in today.	Va ge ɖe eme egbea.
That was a first for me.	Ema nye gbãtɔ nam.
In fact, it’s quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo kura na ema.
But only here.	Gake afisia koe.
Everyone seems to know everything about everyone.	Edze abe amesiame nya nusianu tso amesiame ŋu ene.
He is no longer with us.	Megale mía gbɔ o.
Please, I will have the same thing as before.	Taflatse, nu ma ke anɔ asinye abe tsã ene.
You just feel better.	Ðeko wò dzi dze eme.
He must have been very impressed.	Anɔ eme be eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
Not with the time we had.	Menye kple ɣeyiɣi si nɔ mía si o.
It was really quick and easy.	Ewɔ kaba ŋutɔŋutɔ eye wònɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
But we already know these things.	Gake míenya nu siawo xoxo.
Always trust him.	Ka ɖe edzi ɣesiaɣi.
You know it did happen.	Ènya be edzɔ nyateƒe.
They are talking about a new car.	Wole nu ƒom tso ʋu yeye aɖe ŋu.
A man ran inside.	Ŋutsu aɖe ƒu du ge ɖe eme.
What he had in mind might not work.	Ðewohĩ nusi nɔ susu me nɛ la mawɔ dɔ o.
It’s getting stressful for me.	Ele nu te ɖe dzinye.
Few people are like that.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe le nenema.
It is within reach now.	Ele afisi wòate ŋu aɖo fifia.
Life is beautiful.	Agbe nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
Which of these tasks is easier for you?	Dɔ siawo dometɔ kae le bɔbɔe na wò wu?
Use plenty of salt.	Zã dze geɖe.
This is a huge problem.	Esia nye kuxi gã aɖe.
My real life.	Nye agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I doubt it, but maybe.	Meke ɖi le eŋu, gake ɖewohĩ.
It doesn’t fuck there.	Mewɔa fu le afima o.
My point is it won’t add up.	Nye nya enye be maƒo ƒu o.
I apologize for that.	Meɖe kuku ɖe ema ta.
But if you can, make it work for you.	Gake ne àte ŋui la, na wòawɔ dɔ na wò.
Everything seems to be going well.	Edze abe nusianu le edzi yim nyuie ene.
A lot of people died.	Ame geɖe ŋutɔ ku.
A few people spoke against each other.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo ƒo nu tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
He couldn’t do either.	Mete ŋu wɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
With him you can do what you want.	Le eya gbɔ la, àte ŋu awɔ nu si nèdi.
Maybe not ever.	Ðewohĩ menye gbeɖe o.
It just can’t be true.	Ðeko mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
And so he can.	Eye alea wòate ŋui.
Water is very important.	Tsi le vevie ŋutɔ.
This needs to be done though.	Ele be woawɔ esia gake.
Please take a look at it.	Taflatse lé ŋku ɖe eŋu.
He couldn't hear them now.	Mete ŋu se wo fifia o.
An idea struck him.	Susu aɖe va dze edzi nɛ.
I am in a difficult situation.	Mele nya sesẽ aɖe me.
And now there was a job.	Eye fifia dɔ aɖe nɔ anyi.
We are not like that.	Míele nenema o.
I was shocked to hear that.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ esi mese nya ma.
Speak to them.	Ƒo nu na wo.
That situation improved.	Nɔnɔme ma va nyo ɖe edzi.
The police have left now.	Kpovitɔwo dzo fifia.
I have a better home for you.	Aƒe si nyo wu le asinye na wò.
Getting there is easy.	Afima ɖoɖo le bɔbɔe.
He liked his life.	Eƒe agbe dze eŋu.
I am working on finding a place to stay.	Mele dɔ wɔm be madi teƒe aɖe si manɔ.
I told him he had to have surgery.	Megblɔ nɛ be ele be woawɔ dɔ nɛ.
That’s what we need to do.	Emae nye nusi wòle be míawɔ.
It was a great voice.	Gbe gã aɖee wònye.
This is easy.	Esia le bɔbɔe.
He started sweating heavily.	Edze fifia gɔme vevie.
It can be interesting.	Ate ŋu adzɔ dzi na ame.
He was very attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
Maybe this will be useful to you.	Ðewohĩ esia aɖe vi na wò.
Not about what a great dog he is.	Menye avu gã si wònye ŋu o.
I am fighting for my life.	Mele avu wɔm ɖe nye agbe ta.
I'm sure someone can find them.	Meka ɖe edzi be ame aɖe ate ŋu ake ɖe wo ŋu.
I can’t feel that way again, man.	Nyemate ŋu ase le ɖokuinye me nenema ake o, ŋutsu.
I want my own apartment.	Medi nye ŋutɔ nye xɔ.
His anger subsided easily.	Eƒe dziku nu yi bɔbɔe.
I couldn’t find it.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
They are in the wrong direction here.	Wole mɔ gbegblẽ nu le afisia.
People find hope here.	Amewo kpɔa mɔ le afisia.
This house is beautiful.	Aƒe sia nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
This used to be life.	Tsã la, esia nye agbe tsã.
And that doesn’t exist now.	Eye ema meli fifia o.
I said this backwards.	Megblɔ nya sia ɖe megbe.
However, this doesn’t work for me.	Ke hã, esia mewɔa dɔ nam o.
I didn’t recognize myself or my life.	Nyemekpɔ ɖokuinye alo nye agbe dze sii o.
I do this well.	Mewɔa esia nyuie.
Who wasn’t in it.	Ame si menɔ eme o.
They must have plenty.	Ele be nu geɖe nanɔ wo si.
The animal is good.	Aha la nyo.
He didn’t want to do this.	Medi be wòawɔ esia o.
I was very impressed with him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ.
It’s probably important.	Anɔ eme be ele vevie.
First time on the market .	Zi gbãtɔ le asi me .
Therefore, there is no one who can protect us.	Eya ta, ame aɖeke meli si ate ŋu akpɔ mía ta o.
He doesn’t need a car or obviously a home.	Mehiã ʋu alo edze ƒã be aƒe o.
Now one last thought.	Azɔ susu mamlɛtɔ ɖeka.
But this obviously didn’t work.	Gake edze ƒã be esia mewɔ dɔ o.
I don’t know when.	Nyemenya ɣekaɣie o.
Someone was standing there.	Ame aɖe tsi tre ɖe afima.
He seemed satisfied.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme ene.
But that doesn’t work this time.	Gake ema mewɔa dɔ zi sia o.
You’ll be surprised by what’s in there, maybe something you really like.	Nusi le afima awɔ nuku na wò, ɖewohĩ nane si dzɔa dzi na wò ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That could still be the case, of course.	Ema ate ŋu anɔ nenema kokoko ya.
But it’s not easy.	Gake menye bɔbɔe o.
Each section has its own background.	Akpa ɖesiaɖe kple eƒe akpa si le megbe nɛ.
I am really looking forward to it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He must have had a reason.	Susu aɖe anya nɔ esi.
I stood right there.	Metsi tre ɖe afima tututu.
The work is very important.	Dɔa le vevie ŋutɔ.
I hope it helps you too!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be akpe ɖe ŋuwò hã!.
I did give him this.	Metsɔ esia nɛ nyateƒe.
I am making plans for myself.	Mele ɖoɖo wɔm na ɖokuinye.
I had one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka nɔ asinye.
Please let me know if anything comes to mind.	Taflatse na manya ne nane va susu me na wò.
Nice to meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam be medo go wò.
It doesn’t have to be that way.	Mehiã nenema o.
That was exciting.	Ema do dzidzɔ na ame.
There is not much water here.	Tsi geɖe mele afisia o.
Just a little bit.	Vi aɖe ko.
That doesn’t matter.	Ema mehiã o.
They did not have long to wait.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke menɔ wo lalam o.
People are working.	Amewo le dɔ wɔm.
I don’t know what happened.	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ o.
There is money here.	Ga le afisia.
No one has ever done that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
I was so nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ale gbegbe.
You can never win.	Màte ŋu aɖu dzi gbeɖe o.
But he wasn’t worried.	Gake metsi dzi o.
This is a very good one.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ.
Do what you have to do.	Wɔ nu si wòle be nàwɔ.
Everything had to be done in four days.	Ele be woawɔ nusianu le ŋkeke ene me.
He had worked on it for a long, long time.	Ewɔ dɔ tso eŋu ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
No blood in sight.	Ʋu aɖeke mele ŋku dzi o.
I needed to do it better, work harder, do it right.	Ehiã be mawɔe nyuie wu, mawɔ dɔ sesĩe wu, mawɔe nyuie.
But it wasn’t in or out.	Gake menɔ eme alo nɔ eme o.
I would probably expect it.	Anɔ eme be makpɔ mɔ nɛ.
Tell me the truth.	Gblɔ nyateƒea nam.
I thought that was impossible.	Mesusu be ema manya wɔ o.
Rest assured that everything will be fine.	Ka ɖe edzi be nusianu anyo.
Every part of it.	Eƒe akpa ɖesiaɖe.
No one knows where he is.	Ame aɖeke menya afisi wòle o.
They had very little time.	Ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe nɔ wo si.
We’re not seeing any.	Míele ɖeke kpɔm o.
Much has already happened.	Nu geɖe dzɔ xoxo.
Man, you’re in really impressive shape today.	Ŋutsu, èle nɔnɔme si wɔa dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ me egbea.
Died two days ago.	Ku ŋkeke eve enye sia.

She needed a more mature man.	Ehiã ŋutsu si xɔ ƒe geɖe wu.
It’s just realistic.	Ðeko wònye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There is nothing we can do now.	Naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ fifia o.
Look for it.	Di eme.
Some people do this.	Ame aɖewo wɔa esia.
He was satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme.
I'm going.	Medo go.
He is focused on	Eƒe susu nɔa nu ŋu le
Any idea will be useful.	Susu ɖesiaɖe aɖe vi.
It could have happened to anyone.	Ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe ame sia ame dzi hafi.
It was just that way.	Ðeko wònɔ nenema.
Many of these statements are valid.	Nya siawo dometɔ geɖe sɔ.
There was nothing there.	Naneke menɔ afima o.
I am going to change lives again.	Megale agbe trɔ ge.
For some reason he couldn’t hear them.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, mete ŋu se wo o.
Now, everything became clear.	Fifia, nusianu va dze ƒã.
It could be nothing.	Ate ŋu anye naneke o.
You never know how a book is going to do.	Mènya alesi agbalẽ aɖe ava wɔe gbeɖe o.
Many tried, and none survived.	Ame geɖe te kpɔ, eye ɖeke metsi agbe o.
Buy him a gun.	Ƒle tu nɛ.
This is a mistake.	Esia nye vodada.
I would like the same.	Nye hã madi nenema.
It seems to have worked so far.	Edze abe ewɔ dɔ vaseɖe fifia ene.
He shouldn’t have been surprised.	Mele be wòawɔ nuku nɛ hafi o.
I insisted on going to the meeting myself.	Mete tɔ ɖe edzi be nye ŋutɔ mayi kpekpea.
Maybe a day or two.	Ðewohĩ ŋkeke ɖeka alo eve.
Know that there is another.	Nya be bubu aɖe hã li.
Consider life itself.	Bu agbe ŋutɔ ŋu kpɔ.
We could do more, if we had more money.	Míate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe, nenye be ga geɖe le mía si.
The operation should only be performed once.	Zi ɖeka koe wòle be woawɔ dɔa.
What a wonderful time.	Ɣeyiɣi nyui kae nye si.
I don’t want this for you.	Nyemedi esia na wò o.
Your room is ready, of course.	Wò xɔa le klalo ya.
And money is good, too.	Eye ga hã nyo.
He can do them all.	Ate ŋu awɔ wo katã.
That’s all I’ve come to say.	Eya koe meva be magblɔ.
This stuff is just amazing.	Ðeko nu sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It is, of course, much more than that.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema kura ya.
This is often possible.	Zi geɖe la, esia ate ŋu adzɔ.
And by that means.	Eye to mɔ ma dzi.
In short, nothing works.	Kpuie ko la, naneke mewɔa dɔ o.
Finally, something proactive.	Mlɔeba la, nane si woawɔ do ŋgɔ.
It’s not very complicated.	Menye nusi me kɔ boo o.
If possible, please edit.	Ne anya wɔ la, taflatse trɔ asi le eŋu.
I think that sounds reasonable.	Mesusu be esia ɖi nusi me susu le.
It can’t be better than that.	Mate ŋu anyo wu ema o.
Because it’s my state of mind.	Esi wònye nye susu ƒe nɔnɔme tae.
Not now, not yet.	Menye fifia o, menye haɖe o.
Everything seems to be going well.	Edze abe nusianu le edzi yim nyuie ene.
I am too busy today.	Vovo mele ŋunye akpa egbea.
That’s a good thing.	Ema nye nu nyui aɖe.
Come on, you can handle this.	Va, àte ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ.
In his heart.	Le eƒe dzi me.
Not twice in one day.	Menye zi eve le ŋkeke ɖeka me o.
But never like that.	Gake nenema gbeɖe o.
Something happened.	Nane dzɔ.
Almost everything stopped.	Nusianu kloe nu tso.
I had a job in my stomach.	Dɔ nɔ dɔme nam.
If it doesn’t, do it.	Ne mewɔe nenema o la, ke wɔe.
It’s very obvious, and there’s nothing real about it.	Edze ƒã ŋutɔ, eye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke mele eme o.
We’re going to get there.	Míele afima ɖo ge.
This is working well.	Esia le dɔ wɔm nyuie.
I am the dog.	Nyee nye avu la.
Something tells me it is.	Nane gblɔ nam be ele eme.
My heart is with them.	Nye dzi le wo gbɔ.
There was joy among them.	Dzidzɔ nɔ wo dome.
Here is another from the same source.	Bubu si tso teƒe ma ke enye si.
But look inside the car.	Gake kpɔ ʋua me ɖa.
That made me very happy.	Ema na mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
And this thing happened in one of my cases.	Eye nu sia dzɔ le nye nya ɖeka me.
Take the job.	Xɔ dɔa.
To see who I am now.	Be makpɔ amesi menye fifia.
The house is in order.	Aƒea me le ɖoɖo nu.
He didn’t bother to look my way.	Meɖe fu nɛ be yeakpɔ nye mɔ o.
It will come out well.	Ado go nyuie.
Eventually, the car broke down.	Mlɔeba la, ʋua gblẽ.
Get in our car.	Ðe míaƒe ʋu me.
And a plan formed in his head.	Eye ɖoɖo aɖe va dzɔ ɖe eƒe ta me.
Tell me how you are doing.	Gblɔ ale si nèle la nam.
Not because it’s more important.	Menye esi wòle vevie wu tae o.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
I apologize for this.	Meɖe kuku le nya sia ta.
But none of that came to pass.	Gake ema dometɔ aɖeke meva dzɔ o.
He didn’t prove anything.	Meɖo kpe naneke dzi o.
I don’t know what’s wrong.	Nyemenya nusi gblẽ o.
This year has been incredible.	Ƒe sia nye ƒe si mewɔ nuku o.
I needed to talk to him.	Ehiã be maƒo nu kplii.
To be able to cope.	Be wòate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu.
Death after death.	Ku le ku megbe.
One can imagine many possibilities.	Ame ate ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe siwo ate ŋu adzɔ le susu me.
And it can be a bad thing.	Eye ate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ.
But somehow that challenge was really interesting.	Gake le mɔ aɖe nu la, kuxi ma do dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But he couldn’t be sure.	Gake mete ŋu ka ɖe edzi o.
There is a small lake nearby.	Ta sue aɖe te ɖe afima ŋu.
The king did not answer.	Fia meɖo eŋu o.
Not that I deserve it.	Menye be medze nɛ o.
It is not too late to act.	Metsi megbe akpa be woawɔ nane o.
I don’t know all of them.	Nyemenya wo katã o.
Leave it in order.	Gblẽ ɖi le ɖoɖo nu.
It’s not a winning thing.	Menye nusi ɖu dzi o.
Every city has the same thing.	Nu ɖeka ma ke koe le du ɖesiaɖe me.
But do something.	Gake wɔ nane.
I was just too tired.	Ðeko ɖeɖi te ŋunye akpa.
But he tried well.	Gake edze agbagba nyuie.
I had to do this on my own.	Ele be mawɔ esia le ɖokuinye si.
That’s always the fun part anyway.	Emae nye akpa si doa dzidzɔ na ame ɣesiaɣi le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
He is a young child in a new situation.	Enye ɖevi sue aɖe si le nɔnɔme yeye aɖe me.
Think about it again.	Bu eŋu kpɔ ake.
There was no issue.	Nya aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
There was still a chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ anyi.
Great great great.	Gã gã gã aɖe.
Much, much more than that at all.	Nu geɖe, nu geɖe wu ema kura o.
You seem excited.	Edze abe dzi dzɔ wò ene.
Everyone knows this, but it can work well.	Amesiame nya esia, gake ate ŋu awɔ dɔ nyuie.
They are very small.	Wole sue ŋutɔ.
Only if necessary.	Ne ehiã ko hafi.
This is a great day.	Esia nye ŋkeke gã aɖe.
There is no one in this town.	Ame aɖeke mele du sia me o.
And a lot of work.	Eye dɔ geɖe wɔwɔ.
Some never do this.	Ame aɖewo mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
You better hurry up.	Anyo be nàwɔ kaba.
It made sense, in its way.	Susu nɔ eme, le eƒe mɔ nu.

With one hand.	Kple asi ɖeka.
But time caught up with us.	Gake ɣeyiɣi lé mí.
Not tonight, anyway.	Menye zã sia me o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
This works at the moment.	Esia wɔa dɔ le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
He didn’t care about me.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam o.
Everyone died.	Ame sia ame ku.
We still have a little time.	Ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe gakpɔtɔ le mía si.
Some of them tried.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo dze agbagba.
I think this is just great.	Mesusu be esia nye nu gã aɖe ko.
But there was no fire.	Gake dzo menɔ anyi o.
In that, but not in everything.	Le ema me, gake menye le nusianu me o.

I like the clothes of the past.	Awu siwo ƒe nɔnɔme va yi la dzɔa dzi nam.
At that point, night fell.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, zã do.
Something is wrong here.	Nane gblẽ le afisia.
There could have been.	Ate ŋu anɔ anyi hafi.
An old car.	Ʋu xoxo aɖe.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I made myself breakfast.	Mewɔ ŋdi nuɖuɖu na ɖokuinye.
We have some of them too.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo hã le mía si.
I'll be careful.	Makpɔ nyuie.
I finally got through it.	Meva to eme mlɔeba.
I don’t know why he did that either.	Nyemenya nusita wòwɔ nenema hã o.
He is ready to go.	Ele klalo be yeayi.
Take a deep breath.	Gbɔ ya nyui aɖe.
He didn't seem to care.	Ewɔ abe ɖe metsɔ ɖeke le eme o ene.
I could see right through myself.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu to ɖokuinye me tututu.
That’s a reason.	Susu aɖee nye ema.
The house still stands today.	Aƒea gakpɔtɔ li egbea.
Now that’s gone.	Fifia ema nu yi.
Deal with it.	Wɔ nu kplii.
That was his first and last mistake.	Emae nye eƒe vodada gbãtɔ kple mamlɛtɔ.
Nothing too complicated.	Naneke meli si sesẽ akpa o.
It can be a bad thing.	Ate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ.
If not, do something else.	Ne menye nenema o la, wɔ nu bubu aɖe.
There was nothing new here, again.	Nu yeye aɖeke menɔ afisia o, ake.
And this place is so important.	Eye teƒe sia le vevie ale gbegbe.
Life is more important.	Agbe le vevie wu.
But you can help that person more.	Gake àte ŋu akpe ɖe ame ma ŋu geɖe wu.
Or maybe not everyone knows that.	Alo ɖewohĩ ame sia ame menya nya ma o.
His hand was on my leg.	Eƒe asi nɔ nye afɔ dzi.
What could happen.	Nukae ate ŋu adzɔ.
There are so many things that don’t work.	Nuwo sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ siwo mewɔa dɔ o.
He was only one child.	Vi ɖeka koe wònye.
Yesterday he made another.	Etsɔ wɔ bubu.
That part is simple enough.	Akpa ma le bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
They will have more.	Nu geɖe wu anɔ wo si.
Everyone knows everything.	Amesiame nya nusianu.
There is no right or wrong.	Nu nyui alo nu gbegblẽ aɖeke meli o.
You can’t know it’s impossible.	Màte ŋu anya be manya wɔ o.
They didn’t have time for this.	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ wo si na esia o.
And of course that’s right.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, esia sɔ.
There’s nothing you can’t see.	Naneke meli si màte ŋu akpɔ o.
This obviously becomes more important with age.	Edze ƒã be esia va le vevie wu ne ame tsi.
There really wasn’t that much the house needed.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu geɖe menɔ anyi nenema gbegbe si aƒea hiã o.

This is a different thing.	Esia nye nu si to vovo.
They are waiting for me.	Wole lalam nam.

There is no major mistake.	Vodada gã aɖeke meli o.
But something did happen to me.	Gake nane dzɔ ɖe dzinye nyateƒe.
If this upsets you, you’re not alone.	Ne esia do dziku na wò la, ke menye wò ɖeka koe o.
He needs some help.	Ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo.
I was never sure what else to say about it.	Nyemeka ɖe nya bubu si magblɔ tso eŋu dzi gbeɖe o.
There are two scenarios where this can happen.	Nɔnɔme eve li siwo me esia ate ŋu adzɔ le.
It didn’t bother him.	Meɖe fu nɛ o.
We can go further than that.	Míate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu ema.
I have a lot to tell you.	Nya geɖe le asinye magblɔ na mi.
Do continue to do so.	Do yi edzi.
We enjoy everything.	Nusianu dzɔa dzi na mí.
Get out of my way.	Do go le nye mɔ dzi.
I’m so glad to see you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mekpɔ wò.
Or at least it could be.	Alo ate ŋu anɔ nenema ya teti.
I can’t take this anymore!	Nyemate ŋu axɔ esia azɔ o!
I think there are some good things.	Mesusu be nu nyui aɖewo li.
It’s the last day of school.	Enye suku ƒe ŋkeke mamlɛtɔ.
A lot of life happened to him.	Agbe geɖe dzɔ ɖe edzi.
He was a very strong man.	Enye ŋutsu sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
I know better now.	Menya nu nyuie wu fifia.
This is a very difficult problem.	Esia nye kuxi sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
No life is more precious than another.	Agbe aɖeke mexɔ asi wu bubu o.
They all take time.	Wo katã xɔa ɣeyiɣi.
If you know anything, please share.	Ne ènya nane la, taflatse ma.
He was just that kind of guy.	Ŋutsu ma ƒomevi koe wònye.
That can’t be a good thing.	Ema mate ŋu anye nu nyui o.
But this year is a little different.	Gake ƒe sia ya to vovo vie.
Which is impossible.	Nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o.
This can be of personal benefit to him.	Esia ate ŋu aɖe vi na eya ŋutɔ.
But this time he didn’t care.	Gake fifia ya metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
We can’t travel that far.	Míate ŋu azɔ mɔ ayi teƒe didi ma o.
That’s not unfamiliar to me at all.	Ema menye nusi nyemenya kura o.
Or somewhere.	Alo teƒe aɖe.
I would be happy with it.	Makpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu.
And he didn’t care much, to be honest.	Eye metsɔ ɖeke le eme boo o, ne magblɔ nyateƒea.
What is your opinion?	Nukae nye wò susu?
I think that’s what we’re moving towards.	Mesusu be emae nye nusi gbɔ míele ŋgɔ yim ɖo.
It’s not a long-lasting one.	Menye esi nɔa anyi didi o.
Two of them are better.	Eve le wo dome nyuie wu.
I remember it well now.	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie fifia.
Who will be us.	Amekae anye mí.
And there was something else about it.	Eye nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ eŋu.
He didn’t try to surprise you.	Medze agbagba be yeawɔ nuku na wò o.
I don’t think you can do that.	Mesusu be màte ŋu awɔ ema o.
No one ever said anything else.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya bubu aɖeke kpɔ o.
He will travel into the night.	Azɔ mɔ yi zã me.
This is a minor problem.	Esia nye kuxi sue aɖe.
But he won’t live long.	Gake manɔ agbe didi o.
That doesn’t matter now.	Ema mehiã fifia o.
There was only water now.	Tsi koe nɔ anyi fifia.
It was something he could never do.	Enye nusi mate ŋu awɔ gbeɖe o.
This is simply not true.	Ðeko esia menye nyateƒe o.
I don’t know anything.	Nyemenya naneke o.
I knew from there we were going to have a problem.	Menya tso afima be kuxi aɖe ava mía dzi.
And he’s fascinated by her.	Eye eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
There were many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe nɔ anyi.
Among themselves.	Le wo nɔewo dome.
I was so angry.	Medo dziku ale gbegbe.
I can’t get rid of it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖee ɖa o.
He obviously can’t eat either.	Edze ƒã be mate ŋu aɖu nu hã o.
I have to get out of here.	Ele be mado le afisia.
It would have been great.	Anyo ŋutɔ hafi.
I doubt this will happen.	Meke ɖi be esia ava eme.
He didn’t give them anything they didn’t already have.	Metsɔ naneke si mele wo si xoxo o la na wo o.
He couldn’t hear her, and she couldn’t hear him.	Mete ŋu se eƒe gbe o, eye eya hã mete ŋu se eƒe gbe o.
But, say you want more.	Gake, gblɔ be yedi geɖe wu.
He is not a pushover.	Menye ame si ƒoa ame ɖe nu me o.
I will be more than ready.	Manɔ klalo wu.
And it really is.	Eye ele nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I can’t prove it to myself.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo kpe edzi na ɖokuinye o.
I have found the truth.	Mekpɔ nyateƒea.
It can be in these two phases as well.	Ate ŋu anɔ akpa eve siawo hã me.
There seems to be a lot we don’t know about him.	Edze abe nu geɖe li míenya tso eŋu o ene.
We can’t stay here all night.	Míate ŋu anɔ afisia zã bliboa o.
The early settlers faced many hardships.	Ame gbãtɔ siwo va nɔ afima la do go nɔnɔme sesẽ geɖe.
He knew nothing about anything.	Menya naneke tso naneke ŋu o.
Anyone can find themselves in a difficult situation.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu akpɔ eɖokui le nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe me.
There was no ammunition attached to the gun.	Tu aɖeke menɔ tu la ŋu o.
A man who does the work.	Ŋutsu aɖe si wɔa dɔa.
A nice little machine.	Mɔ̃ sue nyui aɖe.
But it seems like a hard thing to do.	Gake edze abe nu sesẽ aɖee wònye be woawɔ ene.
That’s moving forward.	Ema le ŋgɔ yim.
I know we have a lot going on.	Menya be nu geɖe le edzi yim le mía si.
A man was fighting with himself.	Ŋutsu aɖe nɔ avu wɔm kple eɖokui.
We can’t tell.	Míate ŋu anya o.
No one came along.	Ame aɖeke meva o.
But it’s so obvious that no one would want it.	Gake edze ƒã ale gbegbe be ame aɖeke madi o.
It didn’t surprise them.	Mewɔ nuku na wo o.
And now, come here.	Eye azɔ, va afisia.
Or it may be that	Alo ate ŋu anye ne .
He was just who he was.	Ame si wònye koe wònye.
It worked really well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I tried to fight it.	Medze agbagba be mawɔ avu kplii.
Particular.	Ma.
Which is obvious.	Nusi dze ƒã.
I just can’t do it.	Ðeko nyemate ŋui o.
I don’t know how to approach him.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ ate ɖe eŋu o.
Again, that’s me.	Azɔ hã, nyee nye ema.
Perhaps one of these problems will arise in your life.	Ðewohĩ kuxi siawo dometɔ ɖeka ado mo ɖa le wò agbe me.
Or in the past.	Alo le ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me.
He told me that himself.	Eya ŋutɔ gblɔ nya ma nam.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
Can't take much more than this.	Mate ŋu axɔ nu geɖe wu esia o.
I just couldn’t connect with him.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu do ka kplii o.
It was just a bad time for me.	Ðeko wònye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ aɖe nam.
I am still going on.	Megale edzi yim kokoko.
As a result, it is inexpensive.	Esia wɔe be mexɔ asi o.
The head didn’t look surprised or anything.	Ta la medze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku nɛ alo naneke o ene.
But that is, of course, something completely different.	Gake ema nye nusi to vovo kura ya.
I can get my car.	Mate ŋu axɔ nye ʋu.
I am all important.	Nye katã le vevie.
We’re on the road.	Míele mɔ dzi.
I answered anyway.	Meɖo eŋu to mɔ sia mɔ nu.
It can be useful.	Ate ŋu aɖe vi.
Also, thank you.	Azɔ hã, akpe na wò.
Heal me with your mouth.	Da gbe le ŋunye kple wò nu.
No one expected it.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ mɔ nɛ o.
You can come here.	Àte ŋu ava afisia.
I let go to see his face.	Meɖe asi le eŋu be makpɔ eƒe mo.
There was someone in me.	Ame aɖe nɔ menye.
It’s just a school.	Suku koe wònye.
The house is probably warm now.	Anɔ eme be aƒea me xɔ dzo fifia.
But today I was surprised.	Gake egbea la, ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
No party does this.	Akpa aɖeke mewɔa esia o.
Need help with this.	Hiã kpekpeɖeŋu le esia me.
But it is not impossible.	Gake menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o ye o.
But it’s true that part of me did.	Gake enye nyateƒe be nye akpa aɖe wɔe nenema.
He seemed to be, too.	Edze abe eya hã ene.
I've just been here.	Ðeko meva afisia kpɔ.
I had to sit there and wait.	Ele be manɔ anyi ɖe afima anɔ lalam.
Or a longing.	Alo didi aɖe.
I had a great time with you.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ kpli mi.
You are here now.	Èle afisia fifia.
And if that requires more .	Eye ne ema bia nu geɖe wu .
I'll call you tomorrow.	Maƒo ka na wò etsɔ.
That wouldn’t be easy.	Ema manɔ bɔbɔe o.
Just to experience that.	Be makpɔ ema teƒe ko.
But his face fell.	Gake eƒe mo dze anyi.
I can and will do it.	Mate ŋui eye mawɔe hã.
I don’t know if that’s right for you.	Nyemenya nenye be ema sɔ na wò o.
And its a hard thing to do.	Eye eƒe nu sesẽ aɖee wònye be woawɔ.
I couldn’t bear it.	Nyemete ŋu do dzi o.
But he said nothing to anyone.	Gake megblɔ nya aɖeke na ame aɖeke o.
Your hand exactly what happened.	Wò asi tututu nusi dzɔ.
I gave up a lot of things.	Meɖe asi le nu geɖe ŋu.
Whether it works for them or not.	Ne ewɔ dɔ na wo alo mewɔ dɔ na wo o.
But a lot has changed in recent years.	Gake nu geɖe trɔ le ƒe ʋɛ siwo va yi me.
I don’t know what to do!	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o!
At this point, nothing else matters.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, nu bubu aɖeke mele vevie o.
An hour later, everyone was ready.	Le gaƒoƒo ɖeka megbe la, amesiame nɔ klalo.
An error occurred.	Vodada aɖe dzɔ.
There is nothing personal in it.	Ame ŋutɔ ƒe naneke mele eme o.
I'm actually trying to do the same thing.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele agbagba dzem be mawɔ nu ma ke.
I thought it was amazing.	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Our hair grew.	Míaƒe ɖa tsi.
No one will know I got them.	Ame aɖeke manya be mexɔ wo o.
Straight.	Dzɔ.
Finally, water water.	Mlɔeba la, tsi tsi.
The whole building.	Xɔ bliboa katã.
That seems to make sense.	Edze abe susu le nya ma me ene.
He just wasn’t here.	Ðeko wònɔ afisia o.
But in this case it would be quite different.	Gake le go sia me la, anye nusi to vovo kura.
Still, he didn’t take his eyes off her.	Ke hã, meɖe eƒe ŋku ɖa le eŋu o.
This seems like a very convenient project.	Esia dze abe dɔ si sɔ ŋutɔ ene.
I don’t know where that trend goes from here.	Nyemenya afisi nɔnɔme ma yi tso afisia o.
Something more than that.	Nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema.
That’s just me.	Nye koe nye ema.
There was something else going on.	Nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ edzi yim.
Something bad will happen.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖe adzɔ.
We know what they are like.	Míenya alesi wole.
It’s not that he doesn’t trust people.	Menye ɖe meka ɖe amewo dzi o.
You can do more than that.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu geɖe wu ema.
I need to stay in a clear head.	Ele be manɔ ta si me kɔ nyuie.
It was just himself.	Eya ŋutɔ koe wònye.
There is no help for this.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke meli na esia o.
I wanted to do something else.	Medi be mawɔ nu bubu aɖe.
This is on us.	Esia le mía dzi.
Many of them were available from the year before.	Wo dometɔ geɖe nɔ anyi tso ƒe si do ŋgɔ me.
But it is impossible.	Gake manya wɔ o.
And he didn’t either.	Eye mewɔe hã o.
This is really interesting.	Esia doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But you’re on your very last chance.	Gake èle wò mɔnukpɔkpɔ mamlɛtɔ tututu dzi.

This was out of reach.	Esia nɔ afisi wòate ŋu aɖo o.
I am going through the truth.	Mele nyateƒe me tom.
Nothing is here already.	Naneke mele afisia xoxo o.
It’s a very different life.	Enye agbe si to vovo kura.
This seems to be consistent with the current situation.	Edze abe esia sɔ kple nɔnɔme si li fifia ene.
He can’t do it.	Mate ŋu awɔe o.
It doesn't seem to be working.	Edze abe mele dɔ wɔm o ene.
This is very expensive.	Esia xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
This can’t be that big of a deal.	Esia mate ŋu anye nya gã aɖeke nenema gbegbe o.
He never accepted his death.	Mexɔ eƒe ku le susu me kpɔ o.
And of course, they’re great.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, wole gã ŋutɔ.
Something.	Nane.
That one was really amazing.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka ma wɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I tried to do something like this.	Medze agbagba be mawɔ nane si le abe esia ene.
This is close enough.	Esia te ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe.
You’re getting wet too.	Wò hã èle tsi ƒom.
It was a long night.	Zã didi aɖee wònye.
And he has a name.	Eye ŋkɔ le esi.
And also that	Eye hã be .
I know this is going to be a big year for me.	Menya be ƒe gã aɖee nye esia nam.
You can have the house.	Àte ŋu akpɔ aƒea le asiwò.
These are all good things to do in your life.	Nu siawo katã nyo be nàwɔ le wò agbe me.
I'm sure there are a few things.	Meka ɖe edzi be nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe li.
But it seems impossible to keep up.	Gake edze abe manya wɔ be woawɔ ɖeka kpli wo o ene.
As a result, he was depressed.	Esia wɔe be nu te ɖe edzi.
It is something else.	Nu bubu aɖee wònye.
The sudden realization surprised him.	Nusi dze sii zi ɖeka la wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
That’s a lot of it.	Ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
For a very simple reason.	Susu bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔ tae.
I do not know.	Nyemenya o.
Or it doesn’t matter.	Alo mehiã o.
You have that opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ ma le asiwò.
It’s summer there.	Dzomeŋɔli le afima.
I got a lot of help.	Mexɔ kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe.
Things were good for everyone while he was here.	Nuwo nyo na amesiame esime wònɔ afisia.
We are looking for a new job.	Míele dɔ yeye dim.
But it is a very simple thing.	Gake enye nu bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔ.
Thank you, thank you.	Akpe na wò, akpe na wò.
Some of them, of course.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo ya.
There is no reason for anything.	Susu mele naneke me o.
Picture this in your mind.	Kpɔ esia ɖa le susu me.
Police arrested two of them.	Kpovitɔwo lé wo dometɔ eve.
Have a nice year.	Ƒe nyui aɖe.
I don’t see how that would help.	Nyemekpɔ alesi ema akpe ɖe ŋunye o.
He couldn’t stop thinking about it.	Mete ŋu dzudzɔ eŋu bubu o.
In a positive way.	Le mɔ nyui aɖe nu.
Only one person is eligible.	Ame ɖeka koe dze.
You are not going to.	Menye ɖe nèle edzi yim o.
He did a good job with that.	Ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe le ema ŋu.
He can do it.	Ate ŋu awɔe.
Who we are.	Ame siwo míenye.
Everything here was and is.	Nusianu si le afisia nɔ anyi eye wòle nenema hã.
He didn’t care about that either.	Eya hã metsɔ ɖeke le ema me o.
My back was in the house.	Nye megbe nɔ aƒea me.
Only in the room.	Xɔa me koe.
He has a strong jaw.	Aɖu sesẽ aɖe le esi.
This is a very good one.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ.
But that’s for another day too.	Gake ema nye ŋkeke bubu hã tɔ.
Do what works best for you.	Wɔ nu si aɖe vi na wò wu.
I really want this more than anything.	Medi esia ŋutɔŋutɔ wu nusianu.
This is a huge problem.	Esia nye kuxi gã aɖe.
You can find it.	Àte ŋu ake ɖe eŋu.
This went on for a very long time.	Esia yi edzi ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ.
Another great thing to do.	Nu gã bubu si woawɔ.
No chance for that here.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke meli na ema le afisia o.
I know, and everyone here knows, exactly where it is.	Menya, eye amesiame si le afisia nya, afisi tututu wòle.
Nobody wants to be here.	Ame aɖeke medi be yeanɔ afisia o.
Now go home.	Azɔ yi aƒeme.
A car ran over him.	Ʋu aɖe ƒu du va dze edzi.
That was very close to me.	Ema te ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ.
Step up to the task.	Ðe afɔ ɖe dɔa dzi.
I just found this part-time job today.	Egbea koe mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe ƒe dɔ sia.
That is for the child himself.	Ema nye ɖevi la ŋutɔ tɔ.
Ana was not there.	Ana menɔ afima o.
That’s not a big deal.	Ema menye nu gã aɖeke o.
About it.	Ku ɖe eŋu.
But this is not just a problem.	Gake menye kuxi aɖe koe esia nye o.
But it was never a hit.	Gake menye nusi xɔ ŋkɔ gbeɖe o.
But hold onto that thought.	Gake lé susu ma ɖe asi.
Ultimately, one cannot attempt to make this song.	Mlɔeba la, ame mate ŋu ate kpɔ be yeawɔ ha sia o.
But that shouldn’t be the case.	Gake mele be ema nanɔ nenema o.
I am glad to hear this.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mese nya sia.

And, there was no ‘in between’.	Eye, ‘le wo dome’ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
The head of the building fell inside.	Xɔa ta la ge ɖe eme.
He is doing that for a reason.	Susu aɖe tae wòle nu ma wɔm ɖo.
This is obviously not working.	Edze ƒã be esia mele dɔ wɔm o.

Her head fell forward.	Eƒe ta dze anyi ɖe ŋgɔ.
You told me what you wanted.	Ègblɔ nusi dim nèle nam.

There is no one we know.	Ame aɖeke meli míenya o.
I almost fell over.	Medze anyi kloe.
Very nice place.	Teƒe nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Two major cities are nearby.	Du gã eve te ɖe afima ŋu.
There was nothing on it.	Naneke menɔ edzi o.
I don't understand.	Nye mese egɔme o.
There is still much to do.	Nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.

He deserves more.	Edze na geɖe wu.
We can settle on what works best for me.	Míate ŋu aɖo nusi awɔ dɔ nam nyuie wu la dzi.
We have to do this once in our lives.	Ele be míawɔ esia zi ɖeka le míaƒe agbe me.
I was alone in this small room.	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ xɔ sue sia me.
Usually not much.	Zi geɖe la, menye nu geɖe o.
I’ve never heard of him, anyway.	Nyemese eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I really don’t know what to do.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
Only one teacher survived.	Nufiala ɖeka koe tsi agbe.
You can get an idea of ​​the atmosphere.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nɔnɔme si le eme ƒe susu aɖe.
If you know anyone, let me know.	Ne ènya ame aɖe la, na manya.
It was a completely new idea for me at that age.	Enye susu yeye kura nam le ƒe ma me.
I can't find it now.	Nyemate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu fifia o.
They had more time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu nɔ wo si.
I was overwhelmed by all the people who came forward.	Ame siwo katã do ɖe ŋgɔ la xɔ dzinye ŋutɔ.
There was so much he didn’t know.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi si menya o.

He was less than two years old.	Mexɔ ƒe eve teti o.

He did a few things, but not much.	Ewɔ nu ʋɛ aɖewo, gake menye nu geɖe o.
Someone said something interesting.	Ame aɖe gblɔ nya aɖe si doa dzidzɔ na ame.
It will do it for him.	Awɔe nɛ.
Now it is not so.	Fifia mele nenema o.
The car was still there.	Ʋua gakpɔtɔ nɔ afima.

But that is very difficult.	Gake ema sesẽ ŋutɔ.

You can’t understand it.	Màte ŋu ase egɔme o.
One of them couldn’t stay in the room at all.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka mete ŋu nɔa xɔa me kura o.
Maybe something in me has just been enough.	Ðewohĩ nane si le menye la sɔ gbɔ teti koe nye ema.
It’s just the job.	Dɔa koe.
Yet it doesn’t matter a bit.	Ke hã mehiã vie o.
And you are the	Eye wòe nye .
It couldn’t have come out any better.	Mate ŋu ado tso eme si nyo wu ema o.
But this is difficult.	Gake esia sesẽ.
For each other.	Na wo nɔewo.
The plaintiff refused.	Ame si tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu la gbe.
I’m surprised you can understand them.	Ewɔ nuku nam be àte ŋu ase wo gɔme.
In fact, it may not be possible at all.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ manya wɔ kura o.
We can’t fight.	Míate ŋu awɔ avu o.
Now that money is gone.	Fifia ga ma nu yi.
This is what I missed.	Esia to ŋunye.
Fight, fight, fight.	Wɔ avu, wɔ avu, wɔ avu.
We can live a long life.	Míate ŋu anɔ agbe didi.
Remove excess water.	Ðe tsi si sɔ gbɔ ɖe eme la ɖa.
Nothing could save him.	Naneke mete ŋu xɔ nɛ o.
The logic is obvious.	Susu si le eme la dze ƒã.
After that, everything was clear.	Le ema megbe la, nusianu me kɔ.
He would like to see us.	Adi be yeakpɔ mí.
About two years, one week.	Anɔ abe ƒe eve ene, kwasiɖa ɖeka.
If you’re there, do something else back.	Ne èle afima la, wɔ nu bubu trɔ gbɔ.
I am convinced of it.	Meka ɖe edzi le eŋu.
I am ready to fight.	Mele klalo be mawɔ avu.
I was the last one to leave.	Nyee nye ame mamlɛtɔ si dzo.
Much more is hardly possible.	Nu geɖe wu mate ŋu adzɔ kura o.
Maybe we should do something small.	Ðewohĩ ele be míawɔ nu sue aɖe.
It was a waste of time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
No one who can come close yet.	Ame aɖeke meli si ate ŋu ate ɖe eŋu haɖe o.
I am a new teacher.	Nufiala yeye aɖee menye.
Not this one either.	Menye esia hã o.
Your head is up.	Wò ta le dzi.
He worked very hard.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe ŋutɔ.
This is necessary for two reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae esia hiã ɖo.
I’m so glad I found you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be meke ɖe ŋuwò.
None of them are here.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele afisia o.
Now, let’s do this right.	Azɔ, mina míawɔ esia nyuie.
And it’s not because she couldn’t shop like that or dress like that.	Eye menye esi mete ŋu ƒle nu nenema alo do awu nenema o tae o.
That was his first thought.	Emae nye eƒe susu gbãtɔ.
My dog ​​ran away.	Nye avu si dzo.
He knew nothing about it.	Menya naneke tso eŋu o.
There are only a few of them.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe li.
It may never be that way.	Ðewohĩ manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
Contrary to popular belief.	To vovo kura na nusi ame geɖe xɔ se.
It is a complete lie.	Enye alakpa kura.
It worked for him.	Ewɔ dɔ nɛ.
There was really nothing to do at home.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke menɔ anyi woawɔ le aƒeme o.
He enjoys his role.	Eƒe akpa dzi wɔwɔ doa dzidzɔ nɛ ŋutɔ.
It was a good day for him.	Enye ŋkeke nyui aɖe nɛ.
Not at this time.	Menye le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
I want more things that do that for her.	Medi be nu geɖe wu siwo awɔe nenema nɛ.
I don’t think it’s easy.	Nyemesusu be ele bɔbɔe o.
Check out what’s new there.	Kpɔ nu yeye siwo le afima ɖa.
Without water, life is impossible.	Tsi manɔmee la, agbe mate ŋu adzɔ o.
There is a lot that is missing.	Nu geɖe li siwo bu.
His voice raged in anger.	Eƒe gbe do dziku le dziku me.
I’m glad I’m here.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mele afisia.
There is only one rope king.	Ka fia ɖeka koe.
It’s eating you up.	Ele wò ɖum.
We are not	Míenye .
It’s the only thing that makes sense to me.	Eya koe nye nu si me susu le nam.
I have to stay.	Ele be manɔ anyi.
Everything seemed to be in place.	Edze abe nusianu nɔ teƒe si wòle ene.
I had nothing else.	Naneke bubu aɖeke menɔ asinye o.
He needed my attention.	Ehiã be nye susu nanɔ eŋu.
Everyone has their own thing that works for them.	Ame ɖesiaɖe kple eƒe nu si wɔa dɔ na wo.
They were happy after that.	Dzi dzɔ wo le ema megbe.
He needs all the help he can get.	Ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu siwo katã wòate ŋu axɔ.
I feel like you man.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be wò ame.
I know it’s true.	Menya be enye nyateƒe.
I want to go.	Medi be mayi.
There wouldn’t have been room for me.	Anye ne teƒe manɔ anyi nam o.
Some days are like that.	Ŋkeke aɖewo nɔa nenema.
He doesn’t need any.	Mehiã ɖeke o.
Very good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Actually, the truth is a bit different.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyateƒea to vovo vie.
Some of them don’t know any.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo menya ɖeke o.
There are plenty of suitable men.	Ŋutsu siwo sɔ la sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
The person they are looking for.	Ame si dim wole.
Together we will defeat them.	Míawɔ ɖeka aɖu wo dzi.
Maybe that’s all there is to it.	Ðewohĩ ema koe nye ema.
His face was very bright.	Eƒe mo kɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
You can get closer to these people, and get along with them.	Àte ŋu ate ɖe ame siawo ŋu wu, eye nàwɔ ɖeka kpli wo.
He couldn’t see.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu o.
I think it’s different for everyone.	Mesusu be esia to vovo na amesiame.
Someone fell on us.	Ame aɖe ge dze mía dzi.
These new books are very expensive.	Agbalẽ yeye siawo xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I needed to see you.	Ehiã be makpɔ wò.
Be effective, smart and productive.	Wɔ dɔ nyuie, dze aɖaŋu eye nàwɔ dɔ nyuie.
They’re really, really fun for us.	Wo do dzidzɔ na mí ŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t want to plan too far in advance.	Nyemedi be mawɔ ɖoɖo do ŋgɔ akpa o.
I tried everything, but to no avail.	Mete nusianu kpɔ, gake medze edzi o.
I can’t say enough good things about them.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya nyui siwo sɔ tso wo ŋu o.
Everything happened at once.	Nusianu va dzɔ zi ɖeka.
I know too much.	Menya nu geɖe akpa.
We’ve known this before.	Míenya esia kpɔ.
Or from himself.	Alo tso eya ŋutɔ gbɔ.
Which could be a big mistake.	Nusi ate ŋu anye vodada gã aɖe.
That much was very clear to him.	Nu ma gbegbe me kɔ nɛ ŋutɔ.
It’s not that easy.	Mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
It will be good for everyone.	Anyo na amesiame.
I can’t look back.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ megbe o.
I really want to do it.	Medi be mawɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is not true at all.	Esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
And you can do it.	Eye àte ŋui.
His head was shaking.	Eƒe ta ƒo.
I can be there with them.	Mate ŋu anɔ afima kpli wo.
If you had an idea.	Ne susu aɖe nɔ asiwò la.
I usually have a few hours to get things done.	Zi geɖe la, gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔa asinye be mawɔ nuwo.
One bad moment.	Ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ ɖeka.
In fact, its real life.	Le nyateƒe me la, eƒe agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But it’s amazing.	Gake ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
What was it like in the past?	Aleke wònɔ tsã?
Get that thought out of your head.	Ðe susu ma ɖa le ta me.
His temper is very good.	Eƒe dziku nyo ŋutɔ.
It is something more than that.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema.
There are a lot of people here.	Amewo sɔ gbɔ ɖe afi sia.
For that matter, he wasn't talking to anyone else either.	Le nya ma ta la, menɔ nu ƒom na ame bubu aɖeke hã o.
A few years, maybe more.	Ƒe ʋɛ aɖewo, ɖewohĩ wu nenema.
Look at your back.	Lé ŋku ɖe wò megbe ŋu.
And yet, he needed to try something, anything.	Eye ke hã, ehiã be wòate nane kpɔ, nusianu.
But it couldn’t have been easy.	Gake mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe hafi o.
This is an old problem.	Esia nye kuxi xoxo aɖe.
I like that every once in a while.	Ema dzɔa dzi nam zi ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi aɖewo me.
If it feels like that, that would be great.	Ne se le eɖokui me nenema la, anyo ŋutɔ.
Something must have gone wrong.	Nane anya gblẽ.
He had never found anything.	Meke ɖe naneke ŋu kpɔ o.
Do what you want.	Wɔ nusi nèdi.
The project sounds fascinating.	Dɔa ɖi nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
Many people work from home these days.	Ame geɖe wɔa dɔ le aƒeme le ŋkeke siawo me.
He will eat.	Aɖu nu.
Two problems arise.	Kuxi eve doa mo ɖa.
Or he didn’t do that.	Alo mewɔe nenema o.
I can establish them firmly.	Mate ŋu aɖo wo anyi sesĩe.
It’s a challenge, in a way.	Enye kuxi, le mɔ aɖe nu.
The car fell on him.	Ʋua ge dze edzi.
Doing something is doing nothing.	Nane wɔwɔ nye naneke wɔwɔ o.
I’ve only done two so far.	Eve koe mewɔ vaseɖe fifia.
There is one small issue.	Nya sue ɖeka aɖe li.
Maybe he doesn’t act like you.	Ðewohĩ mewɔa nu abe wò ene o.
And please let me know.	Eye taflatse na manya.
But look at everything that happened.	Gake lé ŋku ɖe nusianu si dzɔ ŋu.
But that didn’t impress me.	Gake ema mewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye o.
The building has seen better days.	Xɔa kpɔ ŋkeke siwo nyo wu.
His character is very different.	Eƒe nɔnɔme to vovo kura.
There was no problem.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Think about what they are looking for.	Bu nusi dim wole ŋu.
Cover each outfit.	Kpɔ awu ɖesiaɖe dzi.
It is so complex.	Enye nusi me kɔ ale gbegbe.
This is impossible to happen.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Now, you’re ready.	Azɔ, èle klalo.
The dress is new.	Awu la nye yeye.
But this never happened.	Gake esia gbeɖe o.
But that makes absolutely no sense.	Gake susu aɖeke mele nya ma me kura o.
Her voice was cheerful.	Dzi dzɔ eƒe gbe.
And there was a lot of it.	Eye nu geɖe nɔ eme.
I'll probably be fine now.	Anye be manɔ nyuie fifia.
A new and ambitious project began last year.	Dɔ yeye aɖe si me didi vevie le la dze egɔme le ƒe si va yi me.
But there is an exception to every rule.	Gake nane li si to vovo na se ɖesiaɖe.
He has no school.	Suku aɖeke mele esi o.
There is no problem there.	Kuxi aɖeke mele afima o.
I'll be right there.	Mava nɔ afima tututu.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
My mind will be racing.	Nye susu anɔ du dzi.
I was that for him.	Nyee nye ema nɛ.
Many are still like that.	Ame geɖe gakpɔtɔ le nenema.
They had very little money.	Ga sue aɖe koe nɔ wo si.
Everything else did.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe wɔe.
It will be here.	Anɔ afisia.
And that’s not easy.	Eye ema mele bɔbɔe o.
But he’s really not that busy.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, vovo mele eŋu nenema gbegbe o.
Stop thinking about this.	Dzudzɔ nya sia ŋu bubu.
Only one side can win.	Akpa ɖeka koe ate ŋu aɖu dzi.
I'm sure it will work well.	Meka ɖe edzi be awɔ dɔ nyuie.
Maybe he didn’t.	Ðewohĩ mewɔe nenema o.
But a few people stayed in their minds.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo tsi susu me na wo.
No one believed him.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ edzi se o.
Everyone wants to do more.	Amesiame adi be yeawɔ geɖe wu.
He was happy to be able to help.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ be yeate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu.
Some of them may have been.	Ðewohĩ wo dometɔ aɖewo nɔ nenema.
I removed some parts.	Meɖe akpa aɖewo ɖa.
Now you are the one to help me.	Fifia wòe nye ame si akpe ɖe ŋunye.
A kind of .	Ƒomevi aɖe si nye .
But it’s not too much trouble.	Gake menye kuxi akpa o.
I’m not sure about that part.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi le akpa ma me o.
And everything looked very, very new.	Eye nusianu dze nu yeye ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
Now get right out of that room.	Azɔ do go le xɔ ma me tututu.
His comments made him very angry.	Eƒe nya sia do dziku nɛ vevie.
This isn’t surprising.	Esia mewɔ nuku o.
Everything was going well.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie.
I want to say that.	Medi be magblɔ nya ma.
And this will be true.	Eye esia anye nyateƒe.
We all have to work together.	Ele be mí katã míawɔ dɔ ɖekae.
Too many problems.	Kuxi geɖe ŋutɔ.
Now just think about this for a moment.	Azɔ bu esia ŋu vie ko.
They are starting somewhere else.	Wole egɔme dzem tso teƒe bubu aɖe.
It’s easier now.	Ele bɔbɔe wu fifia.
However, he can’t seem to get rid of them.	Ke hã, edze abe mate ŋu aɖe wo ɖa o ene.
Doing so is interesting for several reasons.	Esia wɔwɔ doa dzidzɔ na ame le susu geɖe ta.
This is obviously over.	Edze ƒã be esia wu enu.
For many years now.	Ƒe geɖe enye sia.
He had a job to do.	Dɔ aɖe nɔ esi wòawɔ kpɔ.
It is not yours.	Menye wò tɔ wònye o.
After that, two of each.	Le ema megbe la, wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe nye eve.
I should have done it.	Ðe wòle be mawɔe hafi.
The one who saved you.	Ame si xɔ na wò la.
This is a market.	Esia nye asi aɖe.
I don’t know what that’s about.	Nyemenya nusi ŋu nya ma ku ɖo o.
You know too much about it.	Ènya nu tso eŋu akpa.
There is something else.	Nu bubu aɖe hã li.
The independent eye can do nothing.	Ŋku si le eɖokui si mate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
No one can predict where the wind will blow.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu agblɔ afi si ya aƒo ɖo o.
Speak a little bit.	Ƒo nu vie.
Nothing is so fast.	Naneke mele du dzi ale gbegbe o.
It is working fine now.	Ele dɔ wɔm nyuie fifia.
Another time, too.	Ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖe hã.
I removed my hand.	Meɖe nye asi ɖa.
But it looks good to me.	Gake edze nam nyuie.
That’s not why we’re here.	Menye esia tae míele afisia ɖo o.
I couldn’t do anything.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
And that’s what it is.	Eye emae nye ema.
You never know with a dog.	Mènya kple avu gbeɖe o.
If anyone can find it, you can.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu la, àte ŋui.
I felt very strongly about it.	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ŋutɔ.
I am in this situation.	Nye le nɔnɔme sia me.
Or tomorrow.	Alo etsɔ.
I can’t say anything else.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
It’s a real challenge.	Enye kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Please come with us.	Taflatse va kpli mí.
I am in a bad way.	Mele mɔ gbegblẽ aɖe nu.
These two men are also very young.	Ŋutsu eve siawo hã metsi tututu o.
People are too busy today.	Vovo le amewo ŋu akpa egbea.
In many ways.	Le mɔ geɖe nu.
Yet he didn’t do that.	Ke hã mewɔe nenema o.
I'm fine, actually.	Mele nyuie, le nyateƒe me.
No one agreed with him.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ ɖeka kplii o.
They are more difficult to make.	Wo wɔwɔ sesẽ wu.
At this point, no one can.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, ame aɖeke mate ŋui o.
Be very, very careful.	Kpɔ nyuie ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
But nothing seems to have done so.	Gake edze abe naneke mewɔe nenema o ene.
He didn’t stay there long.	Menɔ afima eteƒe didi o.
It had happened to him before.	Edzɔ ɖe edzi kpɔ.
I don’t know what made me take the gun.	Nyemenya nusi na metsɔ tu la o.
No one was happy.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
A man who doesn’t.	Ŋutsu aɖe si mewɔa esia o.
I usually do this.	Zi geɖe la, mewɔa esia.
I can’t ‘imagine life without him.	Nyemate ŋu ‘akpɔ agbe le susu me eya manɔmee o.
I need some money from somewhere.	Mehiã ga aɖe tso afi aɖe.
No one did that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
The house itself seems to be in good shape.	Edze abe aƒea ŋutɔ le nɔnɔme nyui me ene.
This is as good a place as any.	Esia nye teƒe nyui aɖe abe teƒe ɖesiaɖe ene.
It’s just the right thing to do.	Ðeko wònye nusi sɔ.
Now think about that.	Azɔ bu nya ma ŋu kpɔ.
Now that seems questionable.	Fifia edze abe nya le nya ma ŋu ene.
Now the interesting part.	Fifia akpa si doa dzidzɔ na ame.
Rest for an hour or two afterwards.	Gbɔ ɖe eme gaƒoƒo ɖeka alo eve le ema megbe.
And there is no child.	Eye vi aɖeke meli o.
This didn’t work for me.	Esia mewɔ dɔ nam o.
I don’t really know that much about it.	Nyemenya nu geɖe tso eŋu nenema tututu o.
He never wanted to do this.	Medi be yeawɔ esia kpɔ o.
He couldn't do this much longer.	Mete ŋu wɔ esia ɣeyiɣi didi wu ema o.
We have the right people.	Ame siwo sɔ la le mía si.
No one would ever do this in real life.	Ame aɖeke mawɔ esia le agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ me gbeɖe o.
But we don’t have time right now.	Gake ɣeyiɣi mele mía si fifia o.
But he would be a good one.	Gake anye ame nyui aɖe.
I should never have come here.	Mele be mava afisia gbeɖe o.
It’s a job, it’s a job.	Enye dɔ, enye dɔ.
That’s because of that.	Ema nye ema ta.
In fact, a good few did.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame ʋɛ aɖewo nyui aɖewo wɔe nenema.
There are two people here.	Ame eve ye le afisia.
There is a better way.	Mɔ aɖe li si nyo wu.
He couldn't give her anything more than he had before.	Mete ŋu tsɔ naneke nɛ wu esi nɔ esi tsã o.
Enjoy!.	Kpɔ dzidzɔ nyuie!.
These rules are very simple.	Se siawo le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
Today, everyone does everything.	Egbea la, amesiame wɔa nusianu.
He can do better.	Ate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu.
The very first day.	Ŋkeke gbãtɔ tututu dzi.
Once you master something, it’s almost always easy.	Ne ènya nya nane nyuie ko la, ele bɔbɔe ɣesiaɣi kloe.
Only one of them reported that fact.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka koe ka nya ta le nyateƒe ma ŋu.
My man is on it.	Nye ŋutsu le eŋu.
But that is far from it.	Gake ema gbɔ didi ŋutɔ.
You can talk to almost anyone.	Àte ŋu aƒo nu na amesiame kloe.
There are some things that are hard to do.	Nu aɖewo li siwo wɔwɔ sesẽ.
We were always on fire.	Dzo nɔ mía ƒom ɣesiaɣi.
He didn’t do anything to her.	Mewɔ naneke nɛ o.
It’s not about money.	Menye ga tae o.
It could easily be the truth.	Ate ŋu anye nyateƒea bɔbɔe.
To the king.	Na fia la.
However, this isn’t that surprising.	Ke hã, esia mewɔ nuku nenema gbegbe o.
At night,	Le zã me la, .
But he would have wanted more.	Gake anye ne adi nu geɖe wu ema hafi.
I don’t want this.	Nyemedi esia o.
He might have said my name.	Ðewohĩ agblɔ nye ŋkɔ hafi.
Take your time.	Tsɔ wò ɣeyiɣi ɖo.
I only have a car part.	Ʋu ƒe akpa aɖe koe le asinye.
It’s hard for him.	Sesẽ nɛ.
The wind blew from one direction.	Ya ƒo tso akpa ɖeka.
In the first year.	Le ƒe gbãtɔ me.
More money now.	Ga geɖe wu fifia.
But there are still some problems.	Gake kuxi aɖewo gakpɔtɔ li.
It may be in good shape for years.	Ðewohĩ anɔ nɔnɔme nyui me ƒe geɖe.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso eŋu o.
It will always be there.	Anɔ anyi ɣesiaɣi.
When one part goes wrong, another kicks in.	Ne akpa ɖeka gblẽ la, bubu hã ƒoa afɔ ɖe eme.
He obviously didn’t.	Edze ƒã be mewɔe nenema o.
Someone didn’t like it.	Ame aɖe medze eŋu o.
You might be surprised!.	Ðewohĩ awɔ nuku na wò!.
But they are there.	Gake wole afima.
Help me out, please.	Kpe ɖe ŋunye.
I have to act.	Ele nam be mawɔ nu.
I asked another teacher.	Mebia nufiala bubu.
If you can help, that would be great.	Ne àte ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu la, anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I need something to call you.	Mehiã nane si maƒo ka na wò.
Everything was fine.	Nusianu nɔ nyuie.
I have to live somehow.	Ele be manɔ agbe le mɔ aɖe nu.
I think it’s necessary, too.	Mesusu be ehiã, hã.
Yours is a daunting task.	Wò tɔ nye dɔ sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
This is a side issue.	Esia nye nya si le akpa aɖe me.
It is a leg.	Enye afɔ aɖe.
I guess nothing about it should surprise me now.	Mesusu be mele be naneke le eŋu nawɔ nuku nam fifia o.
But you really aren’t in charge of anything.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, menye wòe le naneke dzi kpɔm o.
It impressed us, for now.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe mía dzi ŋutɔ, fifia ya.
Every week for the whole.	Kwasiɖa sia kwasiɖa na bliboa.
That’s good, but not great.	Ema nyo, gake menye gã o.
This teacher did ask for one thing.	Nufiala sia bia nu ɖeka nyateƒe.
I’ve been here before.	Meva afisia kpɔ.
He had told me that himself.	Eya ŋutɔ gblɔ nya ma nam kpɔ.
It won’t do much good.	Maɖe vi boo aɖeke o.
I can’t take any part of this.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ esia ƒe akpa aɖeke o.
Did any of us do that.	Ðe mía dometɔ aɖe wɔe nenema.
Four.	Ene.
Doing a job for you.	Dɔ aɖe wɔwɔ na wò.
Maybe there was something he could find.	Ðewohĩ nane nɔ anyi si ŋu wòate ŋu ake ɖo.
That still interests this kind of project.	Ema gakpɔtɔ tsɔ ɖe le dɔ sia ƒomevi me.
It won’t be like that now.	Manɔ nenema fifia o.
More wildfires are expected this year.	Wole mɔ kpɔm be dzo geɖe wu ado le gbe me le ƒe sia me.
This is easy.	Esia le bɔbɔe.
You're in over your head here.	Èle wò ta dzi le afisia.

But there is still much to do.	Gake nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.
And it did happen in this case.	Eye edzɔ le nya sia me nyateƒe.
I would love to talk to you if you can.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be maƒo nu kpli wò ne àte ŋui.
There was something else this time.	Nu bubu aɖe nɔ anyi zi sia.
He just didn’t really, really care.	Ðeko metsɔ ɖeke le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Today this is not true.	Egbea esia menye nyateƒe o.
He’s here for a reason.	Susu aɖe tae wòle afisia ɖo.
We can live differently.	Míate ŋu anɔ agbe le mɔ bubu nu.
It never took any time.	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖeke gbeɖe o.
This does not seem to be the case.	Edze abe esia mele alea o ene.
We have to do something.	Ele be míawɔ nane.
I was thrilled.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ.
In his first season, he did very well	Le eƒe ɣeyiɣi gbãtɔ me la, ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ
Any sane person would do that.	Ame sia ame si si susu le la awɔe nenema.
Year after year, work, work.	Ƒe sia ƒe la, wɔ dɔ, wɔ dɔ.
It’s not you.	Menye wòe o.
I saw something strange.	Mekpɔ nane si mewɔ nuku o.
People seem to be unaware of these issues.	Edze abe amewo menya nu tso nya siawo ŋu o ene.
That’s why you can’t see much.	Esia tae màte ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe o ɖo.
That sounds pretty good.	Ema ɖi nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Time was of the essence here.	Ɣeyiɣi nɔ vevie ŋutɔ le afisia.
The car looks great.	Ʋua dze nyuie ŋutɔ.
I was only there for one night.	Zã ɖeka koe menɔ afima.
I knew it would never work.	Menya be mawɔ dɔ gbeɖe o.
He would never do it.	Mawɔe gbeɖe o.
He couldn’t get them out of his mind.	Mete ŋu ɖe wo le susu me o.
His voice was loud.	Eƒe gbe sesẽ.
Looks like I have a lot to say.	Edze abe nya geɖe le asinye magblɔ ene.
You can’t piss me off on this.	Màte ŋu ado dziku nam le nya sia ŋu o.
Everything wasn’t right.	Nusianu menɔ nyuie o.
Many of those who came stayed.	Ame siwo va la dometɔ geɖe tsi anyi.
He still wasn’t sure.	Meka ɖe edzi kokoko o.
Two hands joined together.	Asi eve siwo ƒo ƒu ɖekae.
It is one book.	Enye agbalẽ ɖeka.
But no happy feet.	Gake afɔ siwo me dzidzɔ le aɖeke meli o.
That meant a lot to me.	Ema fia nu geɖe nam.
But there is a problem with that.	Gake kuxi aɖe le ema ŋu.
Look at me, guys.	Kpɔm ɖa.
I think this way will work.	Mesusu be mɔ sia awɔ dɔ.
It’s not an impossible task.	Menye dɔ si mate ŋu adzɔ o ye o.
If not, you can try one now.	Ne menye nenema o la, àte ŋu ate ɖeka kpɔ fifia.
The issue is very close to my heart.	Nya la te ɖe nye dzi ŋu ŋutɔ.
There are a few reasons why.	Susu ʋɛ aɖewo li siwo tae.
But there is something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã li.
It’s a reasonable statement.	Enye nya si me susu le.
Things were just that way.	Ðeko nuwo nɔ nenema.
He is not qualified for the job.	Medze na dɔa o.
I decided to go ahead and do it.	Meɖoe be mayi ŋgɔ awɔe.
Thank you	Akpe na wò
He had a reputation for being unkind.	Ŋkɔ nyui aɖe nɔ esi le ame si mewɔa nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu nyuie o ta.
He knew nothing about anything else either.	Menya naneke tso nu bubu aɖeke hã ŋu o.
That house is very bad.	Aƒe ma gblẽ ŋutɔ.
He has this whole other side to him.	Akpa bubu sia katã le esi nɛ.
I got him another role.	Mexɔ akpa bubu nɛ.
I really want to see you.	Medi be makpɔ wò nyateƒe.
There are two things to this.	Nu eve aɖewo le nya sia ŋu.
It can only get better from here.	Ðeko wòate ŋu anyo ɖe edzi tso afisia.
Neither here nor there.	Menye afisia alo afima o.
Put your head down.	Ðe ta ɖe anyi.
That’s really hard.	Ema sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This means focusing at least once.	Esia fia be wò susu nanɔ nu ŋu zi ɖeka ya teti.
That was the only time.	Ɣeyiɣi ma koe nye ema.
They seemed to like that.	Edze abe nya ma do dzidzɔ na wo ene.
Police seized his car.	Kpovitɔwo xɔ eƒe ʋua.
We have a lot in common.	Nu geɖe le mía si siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
There were two people facing each other.	Ame eve nɔ anyi siwo dze ŋgɔ wo nɔewo.
Nothing that different.	Naneke meli si to vovo nenema o.
Not like me.	Menye abe nye ene o.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
This issue has been around for a long time.	Nya sia li ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I have a rather annoying problem.	Kuxi aɖe si doa dziku vie la le ŋunye.
Which is too bad.	Nusi gblẽ akpa.
The whole town heard that.	Du bliboa se nya ma.
And inside was this book.	Eye le eme la, agbalẽ sia nɔ eme.
At that point, he said little.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, megblɔ nya boo aɖeke o.
He never did and he never will.	Mewɔe kpɔ o eye mawɔe hã gbeɖe o.
There is no part of it.	Eƒe akpa aɖeke meli o.
Trust your own common sense too.	Ka ɖe wò ŋutɔ wò susu nyui hã dzi.
You can’t do this, of course.	Màte ŋu awɔ esia ya o.
This was going to be a disaster.	Esia nɔ nu gblẽ ge.
There was something so very alive about him.	Nane nɔ agbe ŋutɔ ale gbegbe le eŋu.
I have a great car.	Ʋu gã aɖe le asinye.
I was among them.	Menɔ wo dome.
It’s just a mental thing.	Susu ƒe nu koe wònye.
But it wasn’t me.	Gake menye nyee o.
I wasn’t sure how to do it.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi mawɔe dzi o.
I would try everything once.	Mate nusianu kpɔ zi ɖeka.
I let it go.	Meɖe asi le eŋu.
Her dog seemed to be enjoying herself.	Edze abe eƒe avu nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm ene.
He never came.	Meva kpɔ o.
In fact, quite the opposite is true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo kura na emae nye nyateƒe.
Many people know this.	Ame geɖe nya esia.
But there is nothing to be done about it now.	Gake naneke meli woawɔ tso eŋu fifia o.
I can help with it.	Mate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu.
Often a new city will be created.	Zi geɖe la, woawɔ du yeye aɖe.
I remember hearing that before.	Meɖo ŋku edzi be mese nya ma do ŋgɔ.
Anyone who saw that kid.	Ame sia ame si kpɔ ɖevi ma.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I think this strategy should work.	Mesusu be ele be aɖaŋu sia nawɔ dɔ.
You can talk to the police.	Àte ŋu aƒo nu kple kpovitɔwo.
I was able to do it.	Mete ŋu wɔe ɖe edzi.
I struggle with it too.	Nye hã mewɔa avu kplii.
A face he never really understood.	Mo si gɔme mese ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o.
None of them are being realistic about it.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele nu ŋutɔŋutɔ wɔm le eŋu o.
The room gets warm.	Xɔa me xɔa dzo.
But now a new problem has emerged.	Gake fifia la, kuxi yeye aɖe va do mo ɖa.
He was just a great guy.	Ðeko wònye ame gã aɖe.
In this section,.	Le akpa sia me la,...
Not legally.	Menye le se nu o.
He was well organized.	Ewɔ ɖoɖo nyuie.
I have this car.	Ʋu sia le asinye.
We can’t find it.	Míate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu o.
To my surprise, a man answered.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ be ŋutsu aɖe ɖo eŋu.
But he seemed very comfortable.	Gake edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme ŋutɔ ene.
That’s the good thing.	Emae nye nu nyui la.
Or at least part of it.	Alo eƒe akpa aɖe ya teti.
It is that simple!.	Ele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe!.
I really don’t want anything more.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi naneke wu ema o.
This can take hours.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe.
He came too, too.	Eya hã va.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This section has four subsections.	Akpa sia ƒe akpa sue ene le eme.
Everything is nothing.	Nusianu menye naneke o.
Think twice before you act.	Bu eŋu zi eve hafi nàwɔ nu.
Many are on his side.	Ame geɖe le eƒe akpa dzi.
We are having a great time.	Míele dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔ.
And he lived by it.	Eye wònɔ agbe ɖe enu.
I wasn’t happy about this.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe esia ŋu o.
I found out about that about a week ago.	Meva nya nu tso ema ŋu abe kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia ene.
He was too young to control it.	Metsi akpa be wòate ŋu aɖu edzi o.
I know his first name.	Menya eƒe ŋkɔ gbãtɔ.
He wasn't talking to her.	Menye ɖe wònɔ nu ƒom kplii o.
Want to do this today.	Di be yeawɔ esia egbea.
In fact, many, many times.	Le nyateƒe me la, zi geɖe, zi geɖe.
Finally and right here and right now.	Mlɔeba kple afisia tututu kple fifia tututu.
You have to work on it.	Ele be nàwɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
Please show proper respect.	Taflatse ɖe bubu si sɔ fia.
But everything will be fine.	Gake nusianu anyo.
It didn’t get wet.	Mexɔ tsi o.
Not in a bad way.	Menye le mɔ gbegblẽ nu o.
Not at this time.	Menye le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
It looks like a new machine.	Edze abe mɔ̃ yeye aɖe ene.
This will definitely surprise them.	Esia awɔ nuku na wo godoo.
The present case is different.	Nya si le edzi yim fifia la to vovo.
The easy part is over.	Akpa si le bɔbɔe la wu enu.
As it was in the end.	Abe alesi wònɔ mlɔeba ene.
I didn’t feel that way.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema o.
Like right now, here with you.	Abe fifia ene, le afisia kpli wò.
This process is time-consuming and can be frustrating.	Dɔ sia wɔwɔ xɔa ɣeyiɣi eye ate ŋu ate ɖe ame dzi.
But this problem still exists.	Gake kuxi sia gakpɔtɔ li.
Thousands of hours.	Gaƒoƒo akpe geɖe.
That will take time.	Ema axɔ ɣeyiɣi.
There was no problem with it.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
But neither did any season.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖeke hã mewɔe nenema o.
Someone will come and get you.	Ame aɖe ava xɔ wò.
It’s not a place.	Menye teƒe aɖeke o.
Water is just as important, if not more so.	Tsi hã le vevie nenema ke, ne menye nenema o la, ele vevie wu.
And so, there will be four parts to my project.	Eye ale, akpa ene anɔ nye dɔa me.
I want to talk about something else.	Medi be maƒo nu tso nu bubu aɖe ŋu.
You know what will happen.	Ènya nusi adzɔ.
I can see no reason why anyone would do this.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ susu aɖeke si tae ame aɖe awɔ esia ɖo o.
But this is something new.	Gake esia nye nu yeye.
Many buildings were damaged.	Xɔ geɖe gblẽ.
He couldn’t tell what it was.	Mete ŋu nya nusi wònye o.
He was very attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
That was very beneficial to us.	Ema ɖe vi na mí ŋutɔ.
And he won’t do it.	Eye mawɔe o.
No one had ever seen one.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ ɖeka kpɔ o.
Some of them got wet.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo tsi tsi.
I can do it better than you.	Mate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu wò.
Remove them all.	Ðe wo katã ɖa.
This goes way beyond common sense.	Esia yi ŋgɔ akpa wu susu nyui.
For his help.	Le eƒe kpekpeɖeŋu ta.
He has a lot on his mind.	Nu geɖe le susu me nɛ.
It’s our job.	Enye míaƒe dɔ.
From nearby buildings, many voices.	Tso xɔ siwo te ɖe afima ŋu me la, gbe geɖe.
Put each problem in one room.	De kuxi ɖesiaɖe ɖe xɔ ɖeka me.
He lost his head.	Eƒe ta bu.
I worked for weeks.	Mewɔ dɔ kwasiɖa geɖe.
In fact, it’s quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo kura.
He didn’t do it either.	Mewɔe nenema ke o.
But something seems to have changed in the past month.	Gake edze abe nane trɔ le ɣleti si va yi me ene.
It would be a waste of time.	Anye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
Right there.	Afima tututu.
Not just for one reason, either.	Menye susu ɖeka ko tae o, eya hã.
It is do or die.	Enye wɔ alo ku.
I am going to try that.	Mele ema te ge kpɔ.
No one really wants to do that.	Ame aɖeke medi ŋutɔŋutɔ be yeawɔ nu ma o.
So far it’s pretty easy.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
The car improved.	Ʋua va nyo ɖe edzi.
Someone else decided that.	Ame bubu aɖee tso nya me le nya ma ŋu.
It’s just too small.	Ðeko wòle sue ŋutɔ.
It’s not a difficult thing.	Menye nu sesẽ o.
That’s enough for now.	Ema sɔ gbɔ na fifia.
Many have never been able to visit his room.	Ame geɖe mete ŋu yi eƒe xɔ me kpɔ o.
Which is good.	Nusi nyo.
Her hair was still wet.	Eƒe ɖa gakpɔtɔ nɔ tsi ƒom.
About many things.	Ku ɖe nu geɖe ŋu.
That thing is beautiful.	Nu ma nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
But he is redeeming himself in a way.	Gake ele eɖokui ɖem le mɔ aɖe nu.
It’s necessary.	Ehiã.
You can talk to me.	Àte ŋu aƒo nu nam.
There is much work to be done in this area.	Dɔ geɖe li woawɔ le go sia me.
Maybe it was just him.	Ðewohĩ eya ŋutɔ koe wònɔ.
In this case, it is.	Le go sia me la, ele nenema.
Two.	Eve.
He liked this room very much.	Xɔ sia dze eŋu ŋutɔ.
The voices in the background.	Gbe siwo le megbe.
I did say stay.	Megblɔ nyateƒe be nɔ anyi.
You can’t do anything either.	Màte ŋu awɔ naneke hã o.
But he had to do that.	Gake ele nɛ be wòawɔ nu nenema.
I would be fighting my own self.	Anye be manɔ avu wɔm kple nye ŋutɔ nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye.
He just can’t do it.	Ðeko mate ŋui o.
But he couldn’t do any himself.	Gake eya ŋutɔ mete ŋu wɔ ɖeke o.
I can’t remember what day.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku ŋkeke ka dzi o.
It’s true, like life.	Enye nyateƒe, abe agbe ene.
It’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
You have to work with everybody.	Ele be nàwɔ dɔ kple amesiame.
Yet, many of them are clearly contradictory.	Ke hã edze ƒã be wo dometɔ geɖe tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
He really doesn’t want to be here.	Le nyateƒe me la, medi be yeanɔ afisia o.
I question everything now.	Meke ɖi nusianu fifia.
See whether you want it or not.	Kpɔ ɖa, ɖe nèdi loo alo mèdi oa.
I am just going to change this outfit.	Ðeko mele awu sia trɔ ge.
If that matters.	Ne ema le vevie.
He didn’t know anything else.	Menya nu bubu aɖeke o.
There’s stuff in the room with us.	Nu le xɔa me kpli mí.
I'll have to go.	Anye be mayi.
It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
Everyone here is like that.	Ame siwo katã le afisia le nenema.
I think he was the only one.	Mesusu be eya ɖeka koe nye ema.
But there is one problem.	Gake kuxi ɖeka aɖe li.
And what someone needs.	Eye nusi ame aɖe hiã.
He was a passionate man.	Enye ŋutsu si me dzo le.
He could be one of the first one or two out.	Ate ŋu anye ame ɖeka alo eve gbãtɔ siwo do go la dometɔ ɖeka.
I can't.	Nyemate ŋui o.
But there’s not much time for that.	Gake ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke meli na ema o.
I can’t feel this way.	Nyemate ŋu ase le ɖokuinye me alea o.
Much more in fact.	Nu geɖe wu le nyateƒe me.

It’s here now and it’s a bit surreal.	Ele afisia fifia eye wònye nusi me susu mele o vie.
I decided to work for myself.	Meɖoe be mawɔ dɔ na ɖokuinye.
He didn’t need my help anyway.	Mehiã nye kpekpeɖeŋu le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
Someone important to us is missing.	Ame aɖe si le vevie na mí la bu.
Only a few of them.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe.
Contradictions came from behind.	Nya siwo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu la tso megbe.
I'll call tomorrow morning.	Maƒo ka etsɔ ŋdi.
He brought his dog with him.	Etsɔ eƒe avu ɖe asi.
He does not deal with the truth.	Mewɔa nu ɖe ​​nyateƒea ŋu o.
These statements are completely unfounded.	Nya siawo medze kura o.
He looked tired, he looked .	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ene, edze abe .
That takes care of that.	Ema kpɔa ema gbɔ.
A really good book.	Agbalẽ nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It can’t be exactly what you’re looking for.	Mate ŋu anye nusi tututu dim nèle o.
There will be no problems.	Kuxi aɖeke manɔ anyi o.
This person must do no good.	Ele be ame sia nawɔ nu nyui aɖeke o.
But you have to have your mouth.	Gake ele be wò nu nanɔ anyi.
Lie to him.	Da alakpa nɛ.
There is nothing he can do now.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ fifia o.
In fact, they had more money in this.	Le nyateƒe me la, ga geɖe wu nɔ wo si le esia me.
He was a very small man.	Enye ame sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
But it’s not like everything changed or anything.	Gake menye abe nusianu trɔ alo naneke ene o.
A great machine with many parts.	Mɔ̃ gã aɖe si ƒe akpa geɖe le.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Nyemenya nusi adzɔ o.
The job wasn’t easy.	Dɔa menɔ bɔbɔe o.
I stood on the stagnant water.	Metsi tre ɖe tsi si tsi anyi la dzi.
I was so excited!	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ!
Something no man can do here.	Nane si ŋutsu aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ le afisia o.
Here and there people greeted each other.	Le afisia kple afima la, amewo do gbe na wo nɔewo.
People will talk.	Amewo aƒo nu.
I had very little food.	Nuɖuɖu sue aɖe koe nɔ asinye.
Your whole life.	Wò agbe bliboa katã.
They are just in good shape.	Ðeko wole nɔnɔme nyui aɖe me.
But the issue didn’t stop there.	Gake nya la metsi ɖe afima o.
But there is one that is a bit new.	Gake ɖeka li si nye nu yeye vie.
In fact, there is something in between.	Le nyateƒe me la, nane le wo dome.
It's too much in your face.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ akpa le mo na wò.
That’s a pretty big deal.	Ema nye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
It’s actually a little weird.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ nuku vie.
Been there and done that.	Menɔ afima kpɔ eye mewɔe nenema.
And you can’t see into it.	Eye màte ŋu akpɔ eme o.
In a word, it was crowded.	Le nya ɖeka me la, amewo sɔ gbɔ ɖe eme.
Act as if he is acting.	Wɔ nu abe ɖe wòle nu wɔm ene.
He can’t do anything else.	Mate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
His whole character changed.	Eƒe nɔnɔme bliboa trɔ.
I can’t make it work for me.	Nyemate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ nam o.
Food is a waste of time for me.	Nuɖuɖu nye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ nam.
He would never do that.	Mawɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
And they are like that.	Eye wole nenema.
I don’t know how he found me.	Nyemenya ale si wòwɔ ke ɖe ŋunye o.
But obviously that would be a lie too.	Gake edze ƒã be ema hã anye alakpa.
But he never did anything wrong.	Gake mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke kpɔ o.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Ðewohĩ, ɖewohĩ, ɖewohĩ.
I needed help.	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu.
It is so much, much more.	Enye nu geɖe ŋutɔ, geɖe wu.
However, the reality is quite another matter.	Ke hã, nyateƒea nye nya bubu kura.
We know you.	Míenya wò.
I know people who need this.	Menya ame siwo hiã esia.
And it’s in the middle.	Eye wòle dome.
It worked for them.	Ewɔ dɔ na wo.
I don't know why I did that.	Nyemenya nu si tae mewɔe nenema o.
In this, say hello to everyone.	Le esia me la, do gbe na amesiame.
This is true for everyone.	Esia nye nyateƒe na amesiame.
The issue is very important.	Nya la le vevie ŋutɔ.
I didn’t mean to do that.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔe nenema o.

Your work can’t just happen with one hand.	Wò dɔa mate ŋu adzɔ kple asi ɖeka ko o.
He had no last name.	Ŋkɔ mamlɛtɔ aɖeke menɔ esi o.
Call me in the morning.	Ƒo ka nam le ŋdi me.
I had no idea what was going on.	Nyemenya nusi nɔ edzi yim o.
In fact, many times.	Le nyateƒe me la, zi geɖe.
I stand ready now.	Metsi tre ɖe klalo fifia.
There is no other way this could have happened .	Mɔ bubu aɖeke meli si dzi esia ate ŋu adzɔ ɖo hafi o .
Not that money is inherently bad.	Menye be ga nye nu gbegblẽ le eɖokui si o.
Thousands of people crowded into the building.	Ame akpe geɖe ƒo zi ɖe xɔa me.
I really enjoyed it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is all your fault.	Esia katã nye wò vodada.
But, it is what it is.	Gake, enye nusi wònye.
I want to see you every day.	Medi be makpɔ wò gbe sia gbe.
Things will be like that.	Nuwo anɔ nenema.
Everyone was talking.	Amesiame nɔ nu ƒom.
No one should be like that.	Mele be ame aɖeke nanɔ anyi nenema gbegbe o.
He didn’t know who he was.	Menya amesi wònye o.
There is nothing more to be done.	Naneke meli woawɔ wu esia o.
But it didn’t bother him.	Gake meɖe fu nɛ o.
There are so many things.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li.
I would have expected to score.	Anye ne makpɔ mɔ be maƒo go hafi.
Everyone seems to have a piece or two of it.	Edze abe eƒe akpa ɖeka alo eve le amesiame si ene.
That last thing, above all.	Nu mamlɛtɔ ma, ƒo wo katã ta.
It has actually happened.	Edzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ.
I knew why his leg wouldn’t let go.	Menya nusita eƒe afɔ maɖe asi le o.
Let’s do something, anyway.	Mina míawɔ nane, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Mary stopped, decided.	Maria tɔ, tso nya me le eŋu.
But I will do the opposite for you.	Gake mawɔ nusi to vovo na wò.
He glanced at her quickly.	Etsɔ ŋku ɖe eŋu kaba.
Help me out of this.	Kpe ɖe ŋunye mado le esia me.
Do it for people who care about you.	Wɔe na ame siwo tsɔ ɖe le eme na wò.
It’s not for everyone.	Menye amesiame tae o.
I was expecting the same thing.	Nye hã menɔ mɔ kpɔm nenema.
It is a thing of the past.	Enye nusi dzɔ va yi.
There is no water.	Mele tsi o.
Yet he could not have been more wrong.	Ke hã mate ŋu awɔ vodada wu ema o.
And that’s enough.	Eye esia sɔ gbɔ.
In fact, he looked like he was going to school.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze abe ɖe wònɔ suku yim ene.
You have the money.	Ga le asiwò.
I think it will work.	Mesusu be awɔ dɔ.
However, we cannot explain the exact reasons for this.	Ke hã, míate ŋu aɖe nu siwo tututu na esia dzɔ la me o.
I can get really close to them.	Mate ŋu ate ɖe wo ŋu tututu.
He is showing a lot of steps.	Ele afɔ geɖe ɖem fia.
Not so much in a bad way.	Menye nenema gbegbe le mɔ gbegblẽ nu o.
I can’t do it, man.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe o, ŋutsu.
For something.	Na nu aɖe.
Life is too beautiful to just live.	Agbe nya kpɔ akpa be wòate ŋu anɔ agbe ko.
The cars piled up on the highway, .	Ʋu siwo ƒo ƒu ɖe mɔ gã la dzi, .
I’m just that.	Nyee nye ema ko.
Reality, as it stands, is one.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ, abe alesi wòle ene la, nye ɖeka.
But he can’t see you today.	Gake mate ŋu akpɔ wò egbea o.
Our name is important.	Míaƒe ŋkɔ le vevie.
He doesn’t have any money.	Ga aɖeke mele esi o.
I hope you enjoyed it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be edzɔ dzi na wò.
There is nothing to plan.	Naneke meli woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu o.
I do this.	Mewɔa esia.
Say please.	Gblɔ be taflatse.
They were brave.	Dzi nɔ wo ƒo.
Some may happen, but not all.	Ame aɖewo ate ŋu adzɔ, gake menye wo katã o.
Yet we still know very little about it.	Ke hã nu sue aɖe koe míenya tso eŋu kokoko.
It’s not expensive, but it’s not expensive, either.	Mexɔ asi o, gake mexɔ asi o, hã.
I was the only one who found anything.	Nye ɖeka koe ke ɖe naneke ŋu.
These people are right.	Ame siawo ƒe nya sɔ.
But there is a problem like this.	Gake kuxi aɖe li abe esia ene.
I just had to do it.	Ðeko wòle be mawɔe.
There all morning.	Afima ŋdi bliboa katã.
It just depends on the current situation.	Ðeko wònɔ te ɖe nɔnɔme si li fifia dzi.
I think it’s awesome!.	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ!.
In fact, people are very interested in this.	Le nyateƒe me la, amewo tsɔ ɖe le esia me ŋutɔ.
But this will take some time.	Gake esia axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
Which is better, who can say?.	Kae nyo wu, amekae agblɔ?.
I miss you so much.	Mesusu wò ŋutɔ.
I want to do this right.	Medi be mawɔ esia nyuie.
There could be several reasons for this.	Susu geɖe ate ŋu anɔ esia ta.
This man seems to know a lot about this city.	Edze abe ŋutsu sia nya nu geɖe tso du sia ŋu ene.
It could have been anything or anyone.	Ate ŋu anye nusianu alo ame sia ame hafi.
He had all his attention now.	Eƒe susu katã nɔ esi fifia.
There was something else.	Nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
He wouldn’t let go.	Maɖe asi le eŋu o.
The case is complex throughout.	Nya la sesẽ le eƒe akpa bliboa katã.
There is a large lake near his house.	Ta gã aɖe le eƒe aƒe gbɔ.
He tried, really tried.	Edze agbagba, edze agbagba ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You very likely had a job.	Anɔ eme be dɔ aɖe nɔ asiwò ŋutɔ.
What happened here today was no accident.	Nusi dzɔ le afisia egbea menye vodada o.
This is a very good one.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ.
There has to be order.	Ele be ɖoɖo nanɔ anyi.
It took me a while to sign up.	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe hafi de asi agbalẽ te.
Make arrangements for it at.	Wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu le.
And you are certainly familiar with that.	Eye ènya nu tso nya ma ŋu nyuie godoo.
But they have one mind and one motive.	Gake susu ɖeka kple susu ɖeka le wo si.
It’s one of a kind.	Enye ɖeka le ƒomevi aɖe me.
The opposite is true.	Nusi to vovo na emae nye nyateƒe.
Maybe this time things will work out better.	Ðewohĩ fifia ya nuwo ava yi nyuie wu.
This wasn’t working.	Esia menɔ dɔ wɔm o.
Life is so short.	Agbe le kpuie ale gbegbe.
Focus on something you can have.	Lé fɔ ɖe nane si ate ŋu anɔ asiwò ŋu.
He wasn’t going to attack us.	Menye ɖe wònɔ mía dzi dze ge o.
Not that he had to do many of them.	Menye ɖe wòle be wòawɔ wo dometɔ geɖe o.
I just couldn’t see why I was working here.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusita mele dɔ wɔm le afisia o.
I didn't want to end up on a mountainside.	Nyemedi be mava wu enu ɖe ​​to ƒe akpa aɖe dzi o.
The protesters stayed for a while.	Ame siwo tsi tre ɖe dɔa ŋu la tsi anyi vie.
That was a long time ago.	Ema nɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
We can’t do it.	Míate ŋui o.
This does not represent us.	Esia metsi tre ɖi na mí o.
That went well.	Ema yi edzi nyuie.
The house is amazing.	Aƒea wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I understand, but no one can help.	Mese egɔme, gake ame aɖeke mate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu o.
He can’t do that.	Mate ŋu awɔe nenema o.
But that makes sense too.	Gake susu le ema hã me.
But it didn’t last long.	Gake menɔ anyi didi o.
Like his life is over.	Abe alesi eƒe agbe wu enu ene.
That would take months.	Ema axɔ ɣleti geɖe.
The things that happened.	Nu siwo dzɔ.
But it is true.	Gake enye nyateƒe.
Anger rose in him.	Dziku do mo ɖa le eme.
One person cannot play every role.	Ame ɖeka mate ŋu awɔ akpa ɖesiaɖe o.
If things go wrong, contact me.	Ne nuwo gblẽ la, te ɖe ŋunye.
This is a very good one.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ.
What a strange statement.	Nya si mewɔ nuku o kae nye si.
I had to be there.	Ele be manɔ afima.
That’s the only reason.	Ema koe nye susu si tae.
What is your opinion?	Nukae nye wò susu?
He couldn’t stop thinking about it.	Mete ŋu dzudzɔ eŋu bubu o.
Please turn onto the main road.	Taflatse trɔ ɖe mɔ gã la ŋu.
It’s something.	Enye nu aɖe.
Please include your name and city.	Taflatse ŋlɔ wò ŋkɔ kple du si me nèle la ɖe eme.
I hope it might take you some time.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ɖewohĩ axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe na wò.
It’s a huge problem.	Kuxi gã aɖee.
I only heard about it yesterday.	Etsɔ koe mese nu tso eŋu.
I’m sorry for the inconvenience.	Meɖe kuku na mi.
In this he was right.	Le esia me la, eƒe nya sɔ.
I just did that last part.	Ðeko mewɔ akpa mamlɛtɔ ma.
I couldn’t believe it.	Nyemete ŋu xɔ edzi se o.
In fact, quite the opposite is true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo kura na ema le nyateƒe me.
I think we can do that.	Mesusu be míate ŋu awɔ ema.
I just work here.	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ le afisia.
At some point in time.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me.
Everyone makes this mistake at some point.	Amesiame wɔa vodada sia le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me.
That’s an expensive part.	Ema nye akpa aɖe si xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
He was a great man.	Ame gã aɖee wònye.
Something was wrong with the whole house.	Nane gblẽ le aƒea ƒe xɔ bliboa me.
I have to stay here.	Ele be manɔ afisia.
You can remove it.	Àte ŋu aɖee ɖa.
There can be no other reason.	Susu bubu aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
Something completely different.	Nu si to vovo kura.
And no one heard a word.	Eye ame aɖeke mese nya aɖeke o.
He might feel that way.	Ðewohĩ ase le eɖokui me nenema.
Still not sure about it.	Meka ɖe edzi kokoko le eŋu o.
I'm not sure exactly how to do this part.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi tututu mawɔ akpa sia dzi o.
He wasn’t sure.	Meka ɖe edzi o.
I never wanted to work for anyone else.	Nyemedi gbeɖe be mawɔ dɔ na ame bubu aɖeke o.
I don’t know where we are now.	Nyemenya afi si míele fifia o.
Some metal types rust easily.	Ga ƒomevi aɖewo xɔa gbe bɔbɔe.
That’s another life.	Ema nye agbe bubu.
Maybe that very night.	Ðewohĩ le zã ma tututu me.
Come here.	Va eye.
We never had to work on that side.	Mehiã be míawɔ dɔ le akpa ma gbeɖe o.
This is so final.	Esia nye mamlɛtɔ ale gbegbe.
They didn’t have any of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
That is certainly possible.	Ema anya wɔ godoo.
That’s my plan.	Emae nye nye ɖoɖo.
He really needs two.	Ehiã eve ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He couldn’t win this one.	Mete ŋu ɖu dzi le esia me o.
Just these four guys.	Ŋutsu ene siawo koe.
It was too busy for us.	Vovo menɔ eŋu o akpa na mí.
He is actually addressing this issue.	Ele nya sia gbɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But in reality, everyone does this to some extent.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, amesiame wɔa esia vaseɖe afi aɖe.
And people set fire to it.	Eye amewo tɔ dzo.
It will do that.	Awɔe nenema.
Probably for many of them.	Ðewohĩ na wo dometɔ geɖe.
No one bothered him in his house.	Ame aɖeke meɖe fu nɛ le eƒe aƒe me o.
Everything must be treated fairly.	Ele be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​nuwo katã ŋu nyuie.
There are four types of things.	Nu ƒomevi ene le eme.
Everything is there.	Nusianu le afima.
He wanted nothing more.	Naneke medi wu ema o.
Thanks.	Akpe.
There are probably two reasons for this.	Ðewohĩ susu eve aɖewo tae wòle nenema ɖo.
Many things are the same.	Nu geɖe hã le nenema.
I don’t know if there are any house rules.	Nyemenya nenye be aƒeme se aɖewo li o.
It’s for everyone.	Enye na amesiame.
Something seemed very strange about her.	Nane dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ le eŋu ene.
It wasn’t like that before.	Menye nenema tsã o.
But no one will ever know that.	Gake ame aɖeke manya nya ma gbeɖe o.
He didn’t give up on anything or anyone.	Meɖe asi le naneke alo ame aɖeke ŋu o.
He didn’t do it.	Mewɔe o.
Yet he made no effort.	Ke hã medze agbagba aɖeke o.
But this is quite enough.	Gake esia sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
There have always been a few dissidents	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo siwo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu nɔ anyi ɣesiaɣi
But only a little bit.	Gake vi aɖe koe.
Stay away from them.	Te ɖa le wo ŋu.
I just want to know how you are today.	Ðeko medi be manya ale si nèle egbea.
I was worried this time last year.	Metsi dzi zi sia le ƒe si va yi me.
I heard that.	Mese nya ma.
My eyes!	Nye ŋku!
But there’s one place we can’t go.	Gake teƒe ɖeka aɖe li si míate ŋu ayi o.
These devices need to be handled properly.	Ele be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​mɔ̃ siawo ŋu nyuie.
He gave me his life.	Etsɔ eƒe agbe de asinye.
You can literally do anything.	Àte ŋu awɔ nusianu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He ran away with her.	Esi dzo kplii.
Nothing is more expensive.	Naneke mexɔ asi wu ema o.
It’s a very good thing.	Enye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
No one really understood what was going on.	Ame aɖeke mese nusi nɔ edzi yim gɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
It’s not too late for you now.	Metsi megbe akpa na wò fifia o.
he charged her.	etsɔ nya ɖe eŋu.
That’s always interesting.	Ema doa dzidzɔ na ame ɣesiaɣi.
Always do things for him.	Wɔ nuwo nɛ ɣesiaɣi.
This is not your idea.	Esia menye wò susu o.
Like that’s doing something.	Abe ɖe ema le nane wɔm ene.
I’m not at home.	Nyemele aƒeme o.
But this is not a problem.	Gake esia menye kuxi o.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I think everyone liked it.	Mesusu be edzɔ dzi na amesiame.
Some of these things are very expensive.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖewo xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
It can definitely only get better.	Ðeko wòate ŋu anyo ɖe edzi godoo.
People were excited.	Amewo kpɔ dzidzɔ.
I hope this helps me.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia akpe ɖe ŋunye.
You can solve this in one of two ways.	Àte ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ to mɔ eve dometɔ ɖeka dzi.
I couldn’t stop the car.	Nyemete ŋu tɔ ʋua o.
I attacked him from behind.	Medze edzi tso megbe.
No one is ever expecting.	Ame aɖeke mele mɔ kpɔm gbeɖe o.
I am being serious.	Mele vevie dom nu.
The police came to the house.	Kpovitɔwo va aƒea me.
He didn’t ask for it.	Mebia tso ame si o.
He didn’t fight them.	Mewɔ avu kpli wo o.
More about who he is.	Nu geɖe wu tso amesi wònye ŋu.
I have to work late tonight.	Ele be mawɔ dɔ le zã sia me tsi megbe.
It’s the ultimate wish.	Enye didi mamlɛtɔ.
Without water, we cannot live long.	Tsi manɔmee la, míate ŋu anɔ agbe didi o.
I have no idea who that could be.	Nyemenya amesi ema ate ŋu anye o.
Convenience is king.	Nusi sɔ na ame nye fia.
He didn’t see a problem with it.	Mekpɔ kuxi aɖeke le eŋu o.
You have something else.	Nu bubu aɖe hã le asiwò.
You might have missed something.	Ðewohĩ nane to ŋuwò hafi.
This year was the complete opposite.	Ƒe sia nye nusi to vovo kura na ema.
Finally, one of his men pointed.	Mlɔeba la, eƒe amewo dometɔ ɖeka fia asi.
But this morning.	Gake ŋdi sia.
He needed the job.	Ehiã dɔa.
There are two things about this.	Nu eve aɖewo le esia ŋu.
I am in this whole situation.	Mele nɔnɔme sia katã me.
I don’t see any mistakes.	Nyemekpɔ vodada aɖeke o.
Find some first-year minutiae.	Di ƒe gbãtɔ ƒe nu sue aɖewo.
Everything more than you want!	Nusianu wu alesi nèdi!
I don’t know what else to tell you.	Nyemenya nya bubu aɖeke magblɔ na mi o.
I’m not really sure.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
No words are needed.	Nya aɖeke mehiã o.
I was very excited.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
You’re the one.	Wòe nye esia.
Not at all.	Menye gbeɖe o.
He’s really hot.	Eƒe lãme xɔ dzo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
No one seems to know the truth.	Edze abe ame aɖeke menya nyateƒea o ene.
But this is only a small thing.	Gake nu sue aɖe koe esia nye.
Many of them went home.	Wo dometɔ geɖe dzo yi aƒeme.
The son hates them.	Vi la lé fu wo.
Not that week.	Menye kwasiɖa ma me o.
But that seems unlikely.	Gake edze abe ema mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.
He has no one.	Ame aɖeke mele esi o.
This was still difficult for him though.	Esia gakpɔtɔ sesẽ nɛ gake.
But it wasn’t easy.	Gake menɔ bɔbɔe o.
You have to do what you have to do.	Ele be nàwɔ nu si wòle be nàwɔ.
The job is not for tomorrow.	Dɔa menye etsɔ tɔ o.
There is one more possibility.	Nu ɖeka bubu aɖe hã li si ate ŋu adzɔ.
But it was because he had none.	Gake esi ɖeke menɔ esi o tae.
That’s just you.	Wò ɖeka koe nye ema.
I didn’t have any time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ asinye o.
He doesn’t have any money.	Ga aɖeke mele esi o.
It can’t come soon enough for me.	Mate ŋu ava kaba nam o.
I did tell the truth.	Megblɔ nyateƒea nyateƒe.
Otherwise, not so much.	Ne menye nenema o la, menye nenema gbegbe o.
I never heard the last part of it.	Nyemese eƒe akpa mamlɛtɔ kpɔ o.
Otherwise it is on its own.	Ne menye nenema o la, ele eɖokui si.
You don’t have to do everything.	Mehiã be nàwɔ nusianu o.
He was such a great person to work with.	Enye ame gã aɖe ŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
Everything is too good.	Nusianu nyo akpa.
There’s an exception, however.	Nane li si to vovo na esia, ke hã.
He really didn’t know what he wanted.	Le nyateƒe me la, menya nusi dim wònɔ o.
But this is not much of a problem.	Gake esia menye kuxi boo aɖeke o.
He’s not just a man now.	Menye ŋutsu koe wònye fifia o.
Remove that and it will work.	Ðe ema ɖa eye wòawɔ dɔ.
I’m not giving anything away.	Nyemele naneke nam o.
It will be here.	Anɔ afisia.
But that’s a big if.	Gake ema nye ne gã aɖe.
Maybe the police are back.	Ðewohĩ kpovitɔwo trɔ gbɔ.
There was no advance.	Do ŋgɔ aɖeke meva o.
Thanks for a great job!.	Akpe na mi ɖe dɔ gã aɖe ta!.
I hope this turns out well.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia ado tso eme nyuie.
Too many thoughts going on in my head.	Susu geɖe akpa siwo le edzi yim le nye ta me.
Don’t you have anything else to do?	Ðe nu bubu aɖeke mele asiwò nàwɔ oa?
To know what is going on in my own home.	Be manya nusi le edzi yim le nye ŋutɔ nye aƒe me.
As it is, it is.	Abe alesi wòle ene.
I was too smart.	Medze aɖaŋu akpa.
So far, it hasn’t been consistent.	Vaseɖe fifia la, mewɔ ɖeka kple wo nɔewo o.
But it was strange in a way.	Gake ewɔ nuku le mɔ aɖe nu.
See! 	Kpɔ!
He was obviously pleased and impressed.	Edze ƒã be edzɔ dzi nɛ eye wòwɔ dɔ ɖe edzi hã.
None of them are necessary.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mehiã o.
I hope this can be of any help.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu ɖesiaɖe.
This is obviously expensive.	Edze ƒã be esia xɔa ga geɖe.
This is discouraging.	Dzi ɖe le esia ƒo.
He wasn’t there.	Menɔ afima o.
I don’t think anyone really did.	Nyemesusu be ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Those who are not with us are against us.	Ame siwo mele mía gbɔ o la tsi tre ɖe mía ŋu.
Go up multiple times during the night.	Yi dzi zi gbɔ zi geɖe le zã me.
The food here is also very good.	Nuɖuɖu si le afisia hã nyo ŋutɔ.
But that was never for him.	Gake ema menɔ nɛ gbeɖe o.
Something had to be done.	Ele be woawɔ nane.
He could not bear his side.	Mete ŋu do dzi le eƒe akpa dzi o.
Open your mind to new possibilities.	Ʋu wò susu ɖe nu yeye siwo ate ŋu adzɔ ŋu.
I’m better and he’s better in this fight.	Me nyo wu eye eya hã nyo wu le avu sia me.
Like an idea.	Abe susu aɖe ene.
Sweat hit his face.	Fifia ƒo eƒe mo.
I will do that.	Mawɔe nenema.
He had a hard life.	Agbe sesẽ aɖe nɔ esi.
These two cities are very far apart.	Du eve siawo dome didi tso wo nɔewo gbɔ ŋutɔ.
His life was nowhere near as happy.	Eƒe agbe menɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm nenema gbegbe le afi aɖeke o.
Look at it there.	Kpɔ afima ɖa.
Now it is inside.	Fifia la, ele eme.
I know nothing about myself.	Nyemenya naneke tso ɖokuinye ŋu o.
It is possible that that could happen.	Ate ŋu adzɔ be ema ate ŋu adzɔ.
That helped me a lot to feel better.	Ema kpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ be nye dzi dze eme.
It’s someone.	Ame aɖee.
Forward whenever you want.	Do ŋgɔ ɣesiaɣi si nèdi.
I will be like that.	Manɔ nenema.
He was amazed at how well it worked.	Alesi wòwɔ dɔ nyuie la wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
Kill each other.	Wu wo nɔewo.
You can make some great money.	Àte ŋu akpɔ ga gã aɖewo.
From everyone, all of you.	Tso amesiame gbɔ, mi katã.
Explain it to him.	Ðe eme nɛ.
Mine is beautiful.	Nye tɔ nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
Way back when.	Mɔ yi megbe esime.
You are not alone in this.	Menye wò ɖeka koe le esia me o.
It’s a two-person project.	Enye ame eve ƒe dɔ.
It is working well.	Ele dɔ wɔm nyuie.
I don’t have the money.	Ga mele asinye o.
It won’t get dirty.	Maƒo ɖi o.
Quite a long time in fact.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ le nyateƒe me.
But that’s not necessarily what you’re looking for.	Gake menye emae nye nusi dim nèle kokoko o.
It’s not enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
It does not create a legitimate privilege.	Mewɔa mɔnukpɔkpɔ si le se nu o.
Happy.	Dzidzɔ kpɔm.
He really threw himself into it, which surprised us.	Etsɔ eɖokui ƒu gbe ɖe eme ŋutɔŋutɔ, si wɔ nuku na mí.
That was all he could do.	Nusi ko wòate ŋu awɔ koe nye ema.
When that happens, the real person can emerge.	Ne edzɔ alea la, ame ŋutɔŋutɔ ate ŋu ado.
I don’t know when that time is coming.	Nyemenya ɣekaɣie ɣeyiɣi ma gbɔna o.
It's too realistic.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ akpa.
It seems impossible.	Edze abe manya wɔ o ene.
In fact, the opposite happened.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na ema va dzɔ.
It doesn’t fit in with anything else.	Mewɔa ɖeka kple nu bubu aɖeke o.
Nothing worked out.	Naneke mewɔ dɔ o.
The better educated generally earn more.	Zi geɖe la, ame siwo de suku nyuie wu la kpɔa ga geɖe wu.
He wasn’t like her.	Menɔ abe eya ene o.
That was a mistake.	Vodada aɖee nye ema.
I touched one with my hand.	Metsɔ nye asi ka asi ɖeka ŋu.
Are you looking for something else?	Ðe nèle nu bubu dim?
His voice dropped.	Eƒe gbe dze anyi.
There were a lot of people there for me.	Ame geɖe nɔ afima nam.
The car broke down.	Ʋua gblẽ.
You have to do this.	Ele be nàwɔ esia.
Once you look good.	Ne ènya dze nyuie ko.
He needed a home, too.	Ehiã aƒe, eya hã.
Like a few of them.	Abe wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ene.
Which, somehow, he has.	Nusi, le mɔ aɖe nu la, le esi.
Did it happen to you?	Ðe wònɔ na wò hã?
It seemed like a real possibility.	Edze abe nusi ate ŋu adzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
I am sure of that.	Meka ɖe edzi le ema ŋu.
Where are your people from?	Afikae wò amewo tso?
A lost opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ si bu.
He wouldn’t let go.	Maɖe asi le eŋu o.
Maybe one of them had a gun.	Ðewohĩ tu nɔ wo dometɔ ɖeka si.
It’s been successful.	Edze edzi.
Drain, if necessary.	Ðe tsi le eme, ne ehiã.
I must still be satisfied.	Anye be nye dzi dze eme kokoko.
But it's not working right now, anyway.	Gake mele dɔ wɔm fifia o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I never saw one of them on a horse.	Nyemekpɔ wo dometɔ ɖeka le sɔ dzi kpɔ o.
That’s a big part of it.	Ema nye eƒe akpa gã aɖe.
It will be easy to deal with.	Anɔ bɔbɔe be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu.
It hurt us so much.	Eve mí ŋutɔ.
He ran away from home.	Esi dzo le aƒeme.
Might need a bit more.	Ðewohĩ ahiã geɖe wu vie.
He never liked this little thing.	Nu sue sia medze eŋu gbeɖe o.
Something like.	Nane si le abe.
The same situation.	Nɔnɔme ma ke.
My dog ​​grew up.	Nye avu la tsi.
You know they are.	Ènya be wole nenema.
And it couldn’t have happened.	Eye mate ŋu adzɔ hafi o.

How can life go on like this!	Aleke agbe ate ŋu ayi edzi le mɔ sia nu!
And like him and all of them.	Eye abe eya kple wo katã ene.
No one knows exactly what to do.	Ame aɖeke menya nu si tututu wòawɔ o.
I understand this.	Mese esia gɔme.
Otherwise, you will only have one.	Ne menye nenema o la, ɖeka koe anɔ asiwò.
I was worried about the outcome.	Nusi ado tso eme la te ɖe dzinye.
This guy is a man of his word.	Ŋutsu sia nye ame si le eƒe nya nu.
But the one.	Gake ɖeka la.
I never should have gone there.	Mele be mayi afima gbeɖe o hafi.
But there is a reason for this.	Gake susu aɖe li si tae wòle alea ɖo.
You have a good reputation.	Ŋkɔ nyui le asiwò.
So many people died.	Ale gbegbe ame geɖe ku.
He is not dead’.	Menye ame kuku o’.
But, maybe, not for you.	Gake, ɖewohĩ, menye na wò o.
His attention returned to the road ahead.	Eƒe susu trɔ yi mɔ si le ŋgɔ nɛ la dzi.
There was a police car in the car.	Kpovitɔwo ƒe ʋu aɖe nɔ ʋua me.
But it didn’t work.	Gake mewɔ dɔ o.
Today will be tough though.	Egbea anye nu sesẽ gake.
A face that has only been around too long.	Mo si li ɣeyiɣi didi akpa aɖe ko.
Nothing like that, and you don’t deserve that either.	Naneke mele nenema o, eye medze na wò hã nenema o.
In the end, the truth will prevail.	Mlɔeba la, nyateƒea aɖu dzi.
But if	Gake ne .
I will meet more.	Mado go geɖe wu.
I resisted it.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu.
I doubt, if they had any desire, that it would work.	Meke ɖi, ne didi aɖe nɔ wo me la, be awɔ dɔ.
I would still enjoy this.	Makpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe esia ŋu kokoko.
That could be a big mistake.	Ema ate ŋu anye vodada gã aɖe.
The police won’t do anything	Kpovitɔwo mawɔ naneke o
It’s what you want to do.	Enye nusi nèdi be yeawɔ.
I am new here.	Nyee nye ame yeye le afisia.
It was just incredible.	Nusi mewɔ nuku o koe wònye.
He didn’t want any.	Medi ɖeke o.
I said look at it.	Megblɔ be kpɔ ɖa.
How boring would it be?.	Aleke gbegbe wòate ɖeɖi ame ŋui?.
He can't do it tonight.	Mate ŋu awɔe le zã sia me o.
He wasn’t so sure.	Meka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o.
But know this.	Gake nya esia.
I don’t know this.	Nyemenya esia o.
I threw them away.	Metsɔ wo ƒu gbe.
It will make everything so much easier.	Ana nusianu nanɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Bring a man back here.	Tsɔ ŋutsu aɖe trɔ gbɔ va afisia.
Go where you want to go.	Yi afi si nèdi be yeayi.
This is exactly why it exists.	Esia tututu tae wòle.
No one will ever know your name.	Ame aɖeke manya wò ŋkɔ gbeɖe o.
You can, you know.	Àte ŋui, ènya.
No work, no food.	Dɔ aɖeke meli o, nuɖuɖu aɖeke meli o.
He will not let them go.	Maɖe asi le wo ŋu o.
His face was bright.	Eƒe mo ƒe mo kɔ.
Come on, we have work to do.	Va, dɔ le mía si míawɔ.
He shouldn’t have done that either.	Mele be wòawɔ nenema hã hafi o.
I wonder how they are doing that.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke wole ema wɔm hã.
Is that all there is to it?	Ðe ema koe nye ema?
The room will not work if there is more than one person in it.	Xɔa mawɔ dɔ ne ame siwo wu ɖeka le eme o.
It’s not like it worked in any way.	Menye abe ɖe wòwɔ dɔ le mɔ aɖeke nu ene o.
But we have to do the work.	Gake ele be míawɔ dɔa.
No one seemed to hear anything.	Edze abe ame aɖeke mese nya aɖeke o ene.
I understood he was on his way.	Mese egɔme be ele mɔ dzi.
You must not make a mistake.	Mele be nàwɔ vodada o.
We are where we are.	Míele afisi míele.
But trust me on this one.	Gake ka ɖe dzinye le esia me.
The answer is simple.	Alesi woawɔ nu ɖe ​​nya ma ŋui la le bɔbɔe.
Or it may be so.	Alo ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
Please, trust me.	Taflatse, ka ɖe dzinye.
You don’t want that.	Mèdi nenema o.
And that’s what we’re trying very hard to do.	Eye emae nye nusi míele agbagba dzem vevie be míawɔ.
Essential.	Si hiã.
Finally, the truth came out.	Mlɔeba la, nyateƒea va do.
It’s just not true.	Ðeko menye nyateƒe o.
Remove the liquid.	Ðe tsi si le eme la ɖa.
You will be amazed at how effective it can be!.	Ale si wòate ŋu awɔ dɔ nyuie la awɔ nuku na wò!.
He did a very good job.	Ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Something happened.	Nane dzɔ.
I have to do it.	Ele be mawɔe.
Now you can do whatever you want.	Fifia àte ŋu awɔ nu sia nu si nèdi.
He's running.	Ele du dzi.
It seemed unreal, none of them did.	Edze abe menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o ene, wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
But as it stands, this is not true.	Gake abe alesi wòle ene la, esia menye nyateƒe o.
That’s the easy part.	Emae nye akpa si le bɔbɔe la.
Good job on this!.	Dɔ nyui aɖe le esia ŋu!.
I know this very well.	Menya esia nyuie.
He never cared about her.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ kpɔ o.
There is a road behind my house.	Mɔ aɖe le nye aƒe megbe.
But this is more than that.	Gake esia sɔ gbɔ wu ema.
He had this incredible fire.	Dzo sia si mexɔ se o la nɔ esi.
Get started now.	Dze egɔme fifia.
That’s not what it is.	Menye emae nye nusi o.
Thank you, just listen.	Akpe na wò, ɖo to ko.
Do this for a week.	Wɔ esia kwasiɖa ɖeka.
He can go to the police.	Ate ŋu ayi kpovitɔwo gbɔ.
But I can say this.	Gake mate ŋu agblɔ nya sia.
You may find this book interesting.	Ðewohĩ agbalẽ sia ado dzidzɔ na wò.
This can happen simultaneously or simultaneously.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me alo le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
Which is always annoying.	Nusi doa dziku na ame ɣesiaɣi.
It won’t be exactly that.	Manɔ nenema tututu o.
Eventually, he got a little better.	Mlɔeba la, eƒe nɔnɔme nyo ɖe edzi vie.
Nothing came of it.	Naneke meva eme o.
Please do more.	Taflatse wɔ geɖe wu.
Something happened at work.	Nane do mo ɖa le dɔme.
We knew it wouldn’t exist.	Míenya be manɔ anyi o.
That is impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Not that either.	Menye ema hã o.
Eventually someone is going to make a new rule though.	Mlɔeba la, ame aɖe le se yeye aɖe wɔ ge gake.
He wanted nothing to do with her.	Medi be yeawɔ naneke kplii o.
Tell me exactly why.	Gblɔ nusi tututu tae nam.
You have a job to do.	Dɔ aɖe le asiwò nàwɔ.
Who knows where he is.	Amekae nya afi si wòle.
This stuff actually works.	Nu sia wɔa dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I shouldn’t have expected him to give up so easily.	Mele be makpɔ mɔ be ana ta bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe hafi o.
He didn’t know where he was.	Menya afi si wòle o.
It’s interesting that I’m not in charge.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ nam be nyemele dɔa dzi kpɔm o.
There is a better way.	Mɔ aɖe li si nyo wu wu.
I can’t get it out of my mind.	Nyemate ŋu aɖee le nye susu me o.
I don’t think that’s true.	Nyemesusu be nya ma nye nyateƒe o.
I just wanted to talk to you.	Ðeko medi be maƒo nu kpli wò.
You can see through my face.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nu to nye mo.
This is not reason in any way.	Esia menye susu le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
We hope you are too.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be wò hã èle nenema.
And there are many reasons why.	Eye susu geɖe li siwo tae.
We had no home, no place.	Aƒe aɖeke menɔ mía si o, teƒe aɖeke menɔ mía si o.
You can try that.	Àte ŋu ate ema kpɔ.
The dog looked tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te avu la ŋu ene.
I'm a little curious about that too.	Nye hã medi be manya nu tso ema ŋu vie.
He took nothing at all.	Etsɔ naneke kura o.
And neither did anyone.	Eye ame aɖeke hã mewɔe nenema o.
At heart, he was her man.	Le eƒe dzi me la, enye eƒe ŋutsu.
He offered her a drink.	Etsɔ aha aɖe nɛ.
A lot can happen between now and tomorrow.	Nu geɖe ate ŋu adzɔ le fifia kple etsɔ dome.
But it will be a loss for us.	Gake anye nusi bu na mí.
It wasn’t fast enough.	Mewɔ kaba ale gbegbe o.
Excited.	Kpɔ dzidzɔ.
I had never heard of them.	Nyemese wo ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
Maybe who he is.	Ðewohĩ amesi wònye.
I am honestly sure of it.	Meka ɖe edzi le nyateƒe me.
I'm not sure what it is.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi wònye dzi o.
I don’t know anything at all.	Nyemenya naneke kura o.
If anything, this is good news.	Ne nane li la, esia nye nya nyui aɖe.
I didn’t want to go inside.	Nyemedi be mayi eme o.
Perhaps he felt the same way.	Ðewohĩ eya hã se le eɖokui me nenema ke.
Not after the fact.	Menye le nyateƒea megbe o.
Perhaps none of them were.	Ðewohĩ wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ nenema o.
That was his first mistake.	Emae nye eƒe vodada gbãtɔ.
It is currently being worked on.	Wole dɔ wɔm tso eŋu fifia.
It seems simple enough.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe ale gbegbe ene.
I’m glad there’s air in the car.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ya le ʋua me.
He never said this life would be easy.	Megblɔ kpɔ be agbe sia anɔ bɔbɔe o.
Every situation is different.	Nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
All things are possible in that moment.	Nuwo katã ate ŋu adzɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
This can be a frustrating problem.	Esia ate ŋu anye kuxi si ate ɖe ame dzi.
Only one man died.	Ŋutsu ɖeka koe ku.
It seemed possible that we were under attack.	Edze abe anya wɔ be wole mía dzi dzem ene.
This dog is only dead for money.	Ga ta koe avu sia ku ɖo.
Some people don’t know what to do.	Ame aɖewo menya nusi woawɔ o.
Neither did their predecessors.	Ame siwo do ŋgɔ na wo la hã mewɔe nenema o.
It will take years and years.	Axɔ ƒe geɖe kple ƒe geɖe.
Here, a version of his house.	Le afisia la, eƒe aƒe ƒe nɔnɔme aɖe.
It would be a good fight.	Anye avu nyui aɖe.
And he would really like to have one.	Eye adi ŋutɔŋutɔ be ɖeka nanɔ ye si.
I’m not in this for the money.	Menye ga la tae mele esia me o.
They are very excited.	Dzi dzɔa wo ŋutɔ.
You’re doing just fine.	Èle edzi dzem nyuie ko.
Money.	Ga.
Not in the case.	Menye le nya la me o.
Almost all of us.	Mí katã kloe.
I needed to do that.	Ehiã be mawɔe nenema.
Someone else is going to answer.	Ame bubu aɖe hã le eŋu ɖo ge.
I was happy about that.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe nya ma ŋu.
Let us at least do this for you.	Mina míawɔ esia ya teti na wò.
That is totally impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ kura o.
He didn’t do what everyone else did in his life.	Mewɔ nusi ame bubu ɖesiaɖe wɔ le eƒe agbe me o.
I am sure, it will eventually happen.	Meka ɖe edzi be, ava eme mlɔeba.
Another year passed.	Ƒe bubu va yi.
His own little one.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe vie.
Two men came to his aid.	Ŋutsu eve va kpe asi ɖe eŋu.
Thank you for the same.	Akpe na wò nenema ke.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
He didn’t stand a chance.	Metsi tre ɖe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke nu o.
We need to have more than that.	Ele be nu geɖe wu ema nanɔ mía si.
Finding a job is a real challenge these days.	Dɔ didi nye kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ le ŋkeke siawo me.
It’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
It was just there.	Afima koe wònɔ.
A blood will come out.	Ʋu aɖe ado le eme.
Now get started.	Azɔ dze egɔme.
They have a lot of people.	Ame geɖe le wo si.
I understand what you are looking for.	Mese nu si dim nèle la gɔme.
We can’t rely on them this time.	Míate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe wo ŋu zi sia o.
There has to be some kind of reason.	Ele be susu aɖe ƒomevi nanɔ anyi.
Sit down, sit back.	Nɔ anyi, nɔ anyi ɖe megbe.
We are all	Mí katã .
And be quick about it.	Eye wɔ kaba le eŋu.
Another problem, too.	Kuxi bubu aɖe hã.
But we can go somewhere else.	Gake míate ŋu ayi teƒe bubu.
Hold on to nothing.	Lé naneke me ɖe asi o.
What will happen to us?	Nukae ava dzɔ ɖe mía dzi?
Today is not that day.	Egbea menye ŋkeke ma o.
I don’t understand this.	Nyemese nya sia gɔme o.
However, it may be.	Ke hã, ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
I don’t know if that tells us anything.	Nyemenya nenye be ema gblɔ nane na mí o.
He is just like everyone else.	Ele abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
That money is nothing.	Ga ma menye naneke o.
Everyone was still at home.	Amesiame gakpɔtɔ nɔ aƒeme.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
He gave everything.	Etsɔ nusianu na.
Whatever it is.	Nusianu si wònye.
I didn’t know who or where to go.	Nyemenya amesi alo afisi mayi o.
In a way, he was the opposite of me.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, enye amesi tsi tre ɖe ŋunye.
So much has been lost.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ bu.
It has no voice of its own.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe gbe aɖeke mele esi o.
But we never had any of that.	Gake ema dometɔ aɖeke menɔ mía si kpɔ o.
Probably a very good one.	Ðewohĩ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
His voice is not in them.	Eƒe gbe mele wo me o.
No one could understand it.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu se egɔme o.
But how can this do any good?	Gake aleke esia ate ŋu awɔ nyui aɖee?
People rarely do things for you.	Ƒã hafi amewo wɔa nuwo le wò ta.
He can’t do it.	Mate ŋu awɔe o.
The car stopped.	Ʋua tɔ.
That makes me very happy.	Ema doa dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
That book was very interesting.	Agbalẽ ma do dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
Just think, no one ever lived.	Bu eŋu kpɔ ko, ame aɖeke menɔ agbe kpɔ o.
After that everything fell apart.	Le ema megbe la, nusianu ge dze anyi.
But he wasn’t alone.	Gake menye eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi o.
A night of truth.	Nyateƒe ƒe zã aɖe.
I didn’t see any guns.	Nyemekpɔ tu aɖeke o.
He did have a book.	Agbalẽ aɖe nɔ esi nyateƒe.
No one we don’t know.	Ame aɖeke si míenya o.
He was very attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
It was a small ship.	Enye meli sue aɖe.
It doesn’t seem to matter much anymore.	Edze abe megale vevie ŋutɔ o ene.
We are releasing them.	Míele wo ɖem ɖe go.
You can give anything.	Àte ŋu ana nu sia nu.
So far it’s as simple as that.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ele bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
And nothing more than that.	Eye menye naneke wu ema o.
Still, there was plenty of room for me.	Ke hã, teƒe geɖe nɔ anyi nam.
It’s not a difficult thing.	Menye nu sesẽ o.
It won’t be useful.	Maɖe vi o.
I was trying to.	Menɔ agbagba dzem.
The whole thing depends on it.	Nu bliboa nɔ te ɖe edzi.
If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu la, adzɔ dzi na mí ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t get up at all.	Nyemete ŋu tso kura o.
Tell him it was me.	Gblɔ nɛ be nyee.
Talk to them.	Ƒo nu kpli wo.
He didn’t want to be anywhere else.	Medi be yeanɔ teƒe bubu aɖeke o.
I was just in it.	Ðeko menɔ eme.
And that person is who that character is.	Eye ame ma nye amesi nɔnɔme ma nye.
Some things you just have to do once.	Nu aɖewo siwo wòle be nàwɔ zi ɖeka ko.
Nothing to do, nothing to do.	Naneke meli woawɔ o, naneke meli woawɔ o.
He will find you.	Akpɔ wò.
I work hard for them.	Mewɔa dɔ sesĩe ɖe wo ta.
We couldn’t have done it without them.	Míate ŋu awɔe wo manɔmee o.
He tried but couldn't speak.	Edze agbagba gake mete ŋu ƒo nu o.
Again, some pretty simple stuff.	Azɔ hã, nu bɔbɔe aɖewo ŋutɔ.
There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eŋu o.
This angered many.	Esia do dziku na ame geɖe.
I have done many good things for people.	Mewɔ nu nyui geɖe na amewo.
His head was down.	Eƒe ta nɔ anyi.
All right, but this stuff can still happen.	Nusianu wɔwɔ nyuie, gake nu sia ate ŋu adzɔ kokoko.
Try it out.	Te edzi kpɔ.
I’m still trying to figure out what that could be.	Megale agbagba dzem kokoko be makpɔ nusi ema ate ŋu anye.
Anything is possible.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
As a teacher.	Abe nufiala ene.
He had two sweats.	Fifia eve nɔ esi.
It is such a comprehensive system that does so much.	Enye ɖoɖo si me kɔ ale gbegbe si wɔa nu geɖe.
It seems reasonable.	Edze abe susu le eme ene.
Maybe it’s not new.	Ðewohĩ menye nu yeye o.
Sweat hit his face.	Fifia ƒo eƒe mo.
I was very interested in it.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme ŋutɔ.
But thank you, guys.	Gake akpe na wò.
I stayed with them.	Menɔ wo gbɔ.
It makes no sense to him.	Susu aɖeke mele eŋu nɛ o.
I am trying to do the same thing.	Mele agbagba dzem be mawɔ nu ma ke.
Maybe he never will.	Ðewohĩ mawɔe gbeɖe o.
What is your opinion on this?.	Nukae nye wò susu le nya sia ŋu?.
He was obviously not happy with me.	Edze ƒã be mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe ŋunye o.
All going well so far.	Wo katã wole edzi yim nyuie vaseɖe fifia.
Get out of your own way.	Do le wò ŋutɔ wò mɔ dzi.
Now she has a child.	Fifia edzi vi.
That was his whole life.	Emae nye eƒe agbe bliboa.
I have something to do.	Nane le asinye mawɔ.
I had never seen anyone so young.	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke si metsi nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
The thing passed him by.	Nu la to eŋu.
I want to do less work.	Medi be mawɔ dɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
You can’t do everything.	Màte ŋu awɔ nusianu o.
It was a long one.	Enye esi didi aɖe.
There is no time limit.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli o.
I know more than you do.	Menya nu geɖe wu wò.
This section will deal with very different issues.	Akpa sia aƒo nu tso nya siwo to vovo kura ŋu.
This can happen for a number of reasons.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ le susu geɖe ta.
People live comfortably here.	Amewo nɔa agbe bɔbɔe le afisia.
There were only a few people.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ anyi.
I have his heart.	Eƒe dzi le asinye.
And so are you, too.	Eye nenema ke wò hã nèle.
Here things are going well.	Le afisia la, nuwo le edzi yim nyuie.
But now new help and new life is here.	Gake fifia kpekpeɖeŋu yeye kple agbe yeye va le afisia.
This issue does not appear in our work.	Nya sia medze le míaƒe dɔa me o.
But that day is long over.	Gake ŋkeke ma wu enu ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
It was a very large building.	Enye xɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Everyone else knows them.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe nya wo.
I don’t know that.	Nyemenya nya ma o.
What's wrong with it?.	Nukae gblẽ le eŋu?.
And they’re fighting here.	Eye wole avu wɔm le afisia.
But he didn’t send them home.	Gake meɖo wo ɖe aƒeme o.
The novelty is almost overwhelming.	Nu yeye si le eme la xɔ aƒe ɖe ame me kloe.
He is, of course, interested.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme na ame ya.
No one answered.	Ame aɖeke meɖo eŋu o.
But not for long.	Gake menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
And you’re probably doing that.	Eye ɖewohĩ èle esia wɔm.
I make breakfast.	Mewɔa ŋdi nuɖuɖu.
It’s just wrong.	Ðeko wònye nu gbegblẽ.
I just don’t understand what it is.	Ðeko nyemese nusi wònye gɔme o.
He never rejected anyone.	Megbe ame aɖeke kpɔ o.
Now we can ride.	Fifia míate ŋu ado sɔ.
I had to get out of these clothes.	Ele be mado le awu siawo me.
Which maybe he can’t do for me.	Nusi ɖewohĩ mate ŋu awɔ nam o.
Expect the same.	Kpɔ mɔ na nenema ke.
But time is against all of us.	Gake ɣeyiɣi tsi tre ɖe mí katã ŋu.

This apartment is beautiful.	Xɔ sia nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
But he will overcome it.	Gake aɖu edzi.

This strategy is no longer alive.	Aɖaŋu sia megale agbe o.
Does this tie go well with that outfit?	Ðe ka sia sɔ nyuie kple awu ma?
One book at a time.	Agbalẽ ɖeka ɖeka.
I think it’s a bit mental.	Mesusu be enye susu me tɔ vie.
This will benefit me.	Esia aɖe vi nam.
That made him happy today.	Ema do dzidzɔ nɛ egbea.
I like a lot of things.	Nu geɖe dzɔa dzi nam.
But every great person did that.	Gake ame gã ɖe sia ɖe wɔ nu ma.
He can do anything.	Ate ŋu awɔ nusianu.
He gave it his attention.	Etsɔ eƒe susu ɖo eŋu.
No one else will talk to you.	Ame bubu aɖeke maƒo nu kpli wò o.
This is not real, of course.	Esia menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o ya.
Just because I can.	Esi mate ŋui ta ko.
You know that plan well.	Ènya ɖoɖo ma nyuie.
I could go on and on.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim.
A real horse.	Sɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe.
The room was too hot.	Xɔa me xɔ dzo akpa.
Click here now.	Zi afisia dzi fifia.
He wasn’t busy.	Vovo menɔ eŋu o.
Or something like that.	Alo nane si le abe ema ene.
It’s just a little bit.	Nu sue aɖe koe.
I know how real this can feel.	Menya alesi gbegbe esia ate ŋu ase le eɖokui me be enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We hope you’re okay.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be èle nyuie.

And it will benefit you.	Eye aɖe vi na wò.

It didn’t surprise me.	Mewɔ nuku nam o.
It was surreal to me as well.	Enye nusi me susu mele o nam hã.

It probably seems like a never-ending process.	Anɔ eme be edze abe nusi nu mayi o ene.

But there was more to it than that.	Gake nu geɖe nɔ eme wu ema.

He really needs help with this.	Ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ le esia ŋu.

There has to be a better way.	Ele be mɔ si nyo wu nanɔ anyi.
It’s the simple one.	Enye esi le bɔbɔe.
Usually you don’t have that.	Zi geɖe la, ema mele asiwò o.
This guy didn’t do that.	Ŋutsu sia mewɔe nenema o.
This is real life.	Esia nye agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And he wanted to.	Eye eya hã di.
Like many good ideas, nothing came of them.	Abe susu nyui geɖe ene la, naneke medo tso wo me o.
I have a better idea.	Susu si nyo wu le asinye.
This was just before that.	Esia nye do ŋgɔ teti na ema wɔwɔ.
I don’t know why he did this, but it looks really good.	Nyemenya nusita wòwɔ esia o, gake edze nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I have been a part of many.	Menye ame geɖe ƒe akpa aɖe kpɔ.
I have everything.	Nusianu le asinye.
And he was fighting hard.	Eye wònɔ avu wɔm sesĩe.
I think they are, but maybe not for everyone.	Mesusu be wole nenema, gake ɖewohĩ menye na amesiame o.
Wear a nice dress.	Do awu nyui aɖe.
It doesn’t seem to have.	Edze abe mewɔe nenema o ene.
Where it will work .	Afisi wòawɔ dɔ le la .
Finally, something went right in my life.	Mlɔeba la, nane va yi nyuie le nye agbe me.
Like my mind lied to my heart.	Abe alesi nye susu da alakpa ɖe nye dzi ŋu ene.
There is no one there.	Ame aɖeke mele afima o.
I am sure he will be very pleased.	Meka ɖe edzi be adzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
And he only wants one.	Eye ɖeka koe di.
People are going to die.	Amewo le kuku ge.
From your place.	Tso wò teƒe.
This same man.	Ŋutsu sia ke.
Talk to you briefly.	Ƒo nu kpli wò kpuie.
They have two weeks.	Kwasiɖa eve le wo si.
Please tell me you can get a dog.	Taflatse gblɔ nam be yeate ŋu axɔ avu.
His sword will be good .	Eƒe yi la anyo ŋutɔ .
We are enjoying ourselves.	Míele dzidzɔ kpɔm.
He didn’t want much that couldn’t be.	Medi nu geɖe si mate ŋu anye o.
I'm in school.	Mele suku.
He will see this clearly.	Akpɔ esia nyuie.
I just felt that way.	Ðeko mese le ɖokuinye me nenema.
I just don’t think this will work.	Ðeko nyemesusu be esia awɔ dɔ o.
But he wouldn’t want to be anywhere alone either.	Gake eya hã madi be ye ɖeka yeanɔ afi aɖeke o.
It did happen, and that’s why people kept trying.	Edzɔ nyateƒe, eye esia tae amewo yi edzi nɔ agbagba dzem ɖo.
It seemed like hours.	Edze abe gaƒoƒo geɖe ene.
I don't understand.	Nyemese egɔme o.
I asked him what.	Mebia nukae.
This time there were four of us.	Fifia ya míenye ame ene.
There is a lot to do.	Nu geɖe li woawɔ.
I have found them.	Meke ɖe wo ŋu.
I have to greet the newcomers.	Ele nam be mado gbe na ame yeye siwo va la.
If is good or bad.	Ne nye nu nyui alo nu gbegblẽ.
This is a good and reasonable statement.	Esia nye nya nyui aɖe si me susu le.
But it’s amazing.	Gake ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Thank you for everything.	Akpe na wò ɖe nusianu ta.
But it will help so many others.	Gake akpe ɖe ame bubu geɖe ŋutɔ ŋu.
I am not ready enough.	Nyemele klalo ale gbegbe o.
You have two private parts.	Akpa eve siwo nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ le asiwò.
It’s just there.	Ðeko wòle afima.
I don’t know what he did.	Nyemenya nusi wòwɔ o.
Nice to meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be menya wò.
It didn’t help him.	Meɖe vi aɖeke nɛ o.
Still, it might be better.	Ke hã, ɖewohĩ anyo wu nenema.
It’s a nice face shape.	Enye mo ƒe nɔnɔme nyui aɖe.
Please do your part.	Taflatse wɔ wò akpa dzi.
I don’t think he didn’t have much.	Nyemesusu be nu geɖe menɔ esi o.
Until this year.	Vaseɖe ƒe sia me.
But in the big picture, this is not possible.	Gake le nya gã la me la, esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.	Nyemenya nu gbegblẽ si wɔm mele o.
We’re making progress, which is good.	Míele ŋgɔ yim, si nyo.
But he couldn’t do it.	Gake mete ŋu wɔe o.
That’s right and that’s right.	Ema sɔ eye esia sɔ.
People will meet.	Amewo ado go.
He didn’t ask which one.	Mebia be kae o.
He just doesn’t know anything.	Ðeko menya naneke o.
We can stay.	Míate ŋu anɔ anyi.
That seems pretty farfetched.	Ema dze abe nusi me susu mele kura o ene.
It seems to have worked.	Edze abe ewɔ dɔ ene.
But somehow it happened.	Gake le mɔ aɖe nu la, edzɔ.
Be confident that you can do anything.	Ka ɖe edzi be yeate ŋu awɔ nusianu.
He was happy to be able to help her.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ be yeate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu.
Now he will stay there until morning.	Fifia anɔ afima vaseɖe esime ŋu ke.
I think that’s pretty good.	Mesusu be ema nyo ŋutɔ.
I don’t want you to be able to have it.	Nyemedi be wòate ŋu anɔ asiwò o.
An opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe.
You need to keep these provisions in mind.	Ele be ɖoɖo siawo nanɔ susu me na wò.
Everyone is going to suffer.	Amesiame le fu kpe ge.
You are like a dog with a bone.	Èle abe avu si ŋu ƒu le ene.
There’s always a problem.	Ɣesiaɣi la, kuxi aɖe nɔa anyi.
Like everything in her house.	Abe nusianu si le eƒe aƒeme ene.

I will tell you the truth.	Magblɔ nyateƒea na wò.
Maybe you can do better.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu awɔe nyuie wu.
We’ve known for some time.	Míenya ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
I have to go now.	Ele be mayi fifia.
He didn’t ask himself any questions.	Mebia nya aɖeke eɖokui o.
I had never seen his face.	Nyemekpɔ eƒe mo kpɔ o.
It was a sudden thought.	Enye susu aɖe si dzɔ zi ɖeka.
Every word is true.	Nya ɖesiaɖe nye nyateƒe.
About everyone and everything.	Ku ɖe amesiame kple nusianu ŋu.
I was a part of that.	Menye ema ƒe akpa aɖe.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I want to keep going.	Medi be mayi edzi.
And if it doesn’t .	Eye ne mewɔe nenema o la .
It just isn’t.	Ðeko mele nenema o.
But no one challenged him.	Gake ame aɖeke metsɔ nya ɖe eŋu o.
I have a room.	Xɔ aɖe le asinye.
Maybe it’s more than that.	Ðewohĩ esia wu nenema.
I couldn’t do it.	Nyemete ŋui o.
Get out of the room.	Do go le xɔa me.
Almost easy money.	Ga si le bɔbɔe kloe.
Return error status.	Trɔ vodada ƒe nɔnɔme.
Nothing here is easy.	Naneke mele afisia bɔbɔe o.
You can get up now.	Àte ŋu afɔ fifia.
He had never seen this before.	Mekpɔ esia kpɔ o.
I know, I don’t know either.	Menya, nye hã nyemenya o.
Imagine a clear space.	Kpɔ teƒe aɖe si me kɔ nyuie le susu me.
I don’t know where he could be.	Nyemenya afi si wòate ŋu anɔ o.
So far I have one.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ɖeka le asinye.
No surprise there perhaps.	Mewɔ nuku o le afima ɖewohĩ.
He never had to do that before.	Mehiã be wòawɔ nu ma kpɔ o.
He was a really great, decent guy.	Enye ŋutsu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ, ame si dze ame ŋu.
If anyone can, it’s you.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋui la, ke wòe.
It was so fresh.	Enye yeye ale gbegbe.
But I might be on my way.	Gake ɖewohĩ manɔ mɔ dzi.
Usually the opposite is true.	Zi geɖe la, nusi to vovo na emae.
I will say a little more about this subject here.	Magblɔ nya geɖe tso nya sia ŋu vie le afisia.
I don’t know much about it.	Nyemenya nu geɖe tso eŋu o.
We don’t know who he is.	Míenya amesi wònye o.
He was in good shape today.	Eƒe nɔnɔme nɔ nyuie egbea.
If nobody wants it, nobody will do it.	Ne ame aɖeke medi o la, ame aɖeke mawɔe o.
Ask someone who knows.	Bia ame aɖe si anya.
He obviously didn’t know what to do.	Edze ƒã be menya nusi wòawɔ o.
My little one here.	Nye sue le afisia.
None of us would do it.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mawɔe o.
There is no time like the present.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli abe fifia ene o.
He couldn’t control himself.	Mete ŋu ɖu eɖokui dzi o.
But I did do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema.
Get to know this person a little better.	Dze si ame sia nyuie vie.
A mistake, just a little one.	Vodada aɖe, sue aɖe ko.
First name is good for us.	Ŋkɔ gbãtɔ nyo na mí.
He started to burn.	Edze dzo.
I know, too easy again.	Menya, ele bɔbɔe akpa ake.
I didn't know how to react.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu o.
Each shot represents a point.	Tu ɖesiaɖe tsi tre ɖi na teƒe aɖe.
Everyone can come up with an idea.	Amesiame ate ŋu ado susu aɖe ɖa.
Each part of each part is easier to automate.	Akpa ɖesiaɖe ƒe akpa ɖesiaɖe le mɔ̃ dzi wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe wu.
We know about this.	Míenya nu tso esia ŋu.
I don’t have a car.	Ʋu mele asinye o.
No one ever had an idea.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ susu aɖeke kpɔ o.
It’s really amazing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But he didn’t care.	Gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
But he was tired of it.	Gake ɖeɖi te eŋu le eŋu.
We don’t know much about it.	Míenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o.
Not kind of like that.	Menye nenema o ƒomevi.
I just couldn’t imagine them any other way.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu kpɔ wo le susu me le mɔ bubu aɖeke nu o.
Many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe.
We really liked the apartment.	Xɔa dze mía ŋu ŋutɔ.
That’s just you.	Wò ɖeka koe nye ema.
He deserves better than you.	Edze na nusi nyo wu wò.
I have to tell you everything.	Ele be magblɔ nya sia nya na mi.
I arrived late.	Meva tsi megbe.
His first death.	Eƒe ku gbãtɔ.
If you have any issues, please let me know.	Ne nya aɖe le fu ɖem na wò la, taflatse na manya.
Clearly, that was an impossible task.	Eme kɔ ƒã be dɔ si mate ŋu adzɔ o ye nye ema.
I want to do it.	Medi be mawɔe.
It’s very clear.	Eme kɔ ŋutɔ.
As respectable people should.	Abe alesi wòle be ame siwo ŋu bubu le nawɔ ene.
Besides that, his loss of self grew out of it.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe ema ŋu la, eƒe eɖokui bu la tsi tso eme.
Less for more.	Susu sue aɖe ko na nu geɖe wu.
More like hours.	Edze abe gaƒoƒo geɖe ene wu.
There was a good reason for this.	Susu nyui aɖe nɔ anyi si tae wòle alea ɖo.
Just do it.	Wɔe ko.
No one answered.	Ame aɖeke meɖo eŋu o.
It is, of course, a big part of it.	Enye nyateƒe be enye eƒe akpa gã aɖe.
I got this working great.	Mexɔ esia le dɔ wɔm nyuie ŋutɔ.
I thought we were having a good morning.	Mesusu be míele ŋdi nyui aɖe ɖum.
It was only once.	Zi ɖeka koe wònye.
You can say anything.	Àte ŋu agblɔ nya sia nya.
You can tell people let’s do something about this, help me.	Àte ŋu agblɔ na amewo be mina míawɔ nane tso esia ŋu, kpe ɖe ŋunye.
My dog ​​is important to me.	Nye avu le vevie nam.
We’re not there yet.	Míele afima haɖe o.
That is very important to me.	Ema le vevie nam ŋutɔ.
I’m smart.	Medze aɖaŋu.
Someone was behind him.	Ame aɖe nɔ megbe nɛ.
I am worried about it now.	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu fifia.
It is a lot of things.	Enye nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
What’s the big deal? 	Nukae nye nya gã la?
This makes no sense to me.	Susu aɖeke mele nya sia ŋu nam o.
There is none of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
Something has happened.	Nane do mo ɖa.
Something will happen to you and your car.	Nane adzɔ ɖe wò kple wò ʋu dzi.
And it’s a great opportunity.	Eye mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖee wònye.
And it’s amazing.	Eye ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Like many great ideas, it’s actually simple.	Abe susu gã geɖe ene la, le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe.
I was very nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ.
This will work to some extent.	Esia awɔ dɔ vaseɖe afi aɖe.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There was nothing in it.	Naneke menɔ eme o.
It wasn’t bothering him.	Menye ɖe wòle fu ɖem nɛ o.
He couldn’t remember.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi o.
I am realistic about the truth.	Mewɔa nu ŋutɔŋutɔ le nyateƒea ŋu.
We are well aware of that.	Míenya nu tso nya ma ŋu nyuie.
He never approached them.	Mete ɖe wo ŋu kpɔ o.
I made a death mistake.	Mewɔ vodada ku.
But I want to look the other way.	Gake medi be makpɔ mɔ bubu.
In many cases.	Le go geɖe me la.
In fact, this is not true.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia menye nyateƒe o.
You can meet weird people.	Àte ŋu ado go ame siwo mewɔ nuku o.
He didn’t find me.	Meke ɖe ŋunye o.
Not really enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
This much is very clear.	Esia geɖe me kɔ ŋutɔ.
Speechless.	Màte ŋu aƒo nu o.
And a good one, too.	Eye nyui aɖe hã.
Not in this way.	Menye mɔ sia nu o.
It worked.	Ewɔ dɔ.
Which is the closest.	Kae nye esi te ɖe eŋu wu.
No one seemed to believe him or see what he was seeing.	Edze abe ame aɖeke mexɔ edzi se alo kpɔ nusi kpɔm wònɔ o ene.
I'm better now.	Me nyo wu fifia.
It’s all clear here.	Wo katã me kɔ le afisia.
A lot has changed but a lot seems to have stayed the same.	Nu geɖe trɔ gake edze abe nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ nenema ene.
Another in the background.	Bubu le megbe.
There is no problem here.	Kuxi aɖeke mele afisia o.
Everything looked good.	Nusianu dze nyuie.
But the opposite happened.	Gake nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ.
Things are better between these cities.	Nuwo nyo wu le du siawo dome.
Bits and pieces of my life.	Nye agbe ƒe akpa aɖewo kple akpa aɖewo.
Now this is important.	Fifia esia le vevie.
Start with a few things.	Dze egɔme kple nu ʋɛ aɖewo.
That sounds pretty good.	Ema ɖi nya nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can’t do much.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe o.
Two this week, two next week, and two or four next month.	Eve le kwasiɖa sia me, eve le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me, kple eve alo ene le ɣleti si gbɔna me.
It is very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ.
A room is part of a house.	Xɔ aɖe nye aƒe aɖe ƒe akpa aɖe.
Stone on stone.	Kpe ɖe kpe dzi.
Maybe it’s a good idea.	Ðewohĩ susu nyui aɖee.
Which is what he wants.	Nusi nye nusi eya ŋutɔ di.
Create a new name for these terms.	Wɔ ŋkɔ yeye na nya siawo.
There are many things we can do.	Nu geɖe li míate ŋu awɔ.
No one else was there.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afima o.
This is more like a house.	Esia ɖi aƒe aɖe tɔ wu.
Time to schedule it.	Ɣeyiɣi si woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
I wonder how we will cope without him.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke míawɔ anɔ te ɖe enu eya manɔmee hã.
No one ever really knows the truth.	Ame aɖeke menya nyateƒea ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
Check out this work of mine.	Kpɔ nye dɔ sia ɖa.
There are quite a few of them.	Wo sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
Like a lake.	Abe ta aɖe ene.
I have never known.	Nyemenya kpɔ o.
But I never saw anyone there.	Gake nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke le afima kpɔ o.
This was going to cost money.	Esia nɔ ga xɔ ge.
I don’t want to promise anything.	Nyemedi be mado naneke ƒe ŋugbe o.
He would like to be there.	Adi be yeanɔ afima.
How did you	Aleke nèwɔ .
We do have something that works together.	Nane si wɔa dɔ ɖekae le mía si ya.
Something’s missing you.	Nane to ŋuwò.
He didn’t understand, he couldn’t understand.	Mese egɔme o, mete ŋu se egɔme o.
See which one works best for you.	Kpɔ esi awɔ dɔ na wò nyuie wu ɖa.
Today was a great one.	Egbea nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Or anything else with a name on it.	Alo nu bubu ɖesiaɖe si dzi ŋkɔ le.
Not much of anything.	Menye nu geɖe o.
He seemed to enjoy it.	Edze abe edzɔ dzi nɛ ene.
That’s what you’re seeing.	Emae nye nusi kpɔm nèle.
But he couldn’t stop thinking about it.	Gake mete ŋu dzudzɔ eŋu bubu o.
He didn’t know about that.	Menya nu tso nya ma ŋu o.
He didn’t want to do anything.	Medi be yeawɔ naneke o.
In the coming weeks.	Le kwasiɖa siwo gbɔna me.
A big mistake is not.	Vodada gã aɖee nye be menye nenema o.
If only you were here.	Ne ɖe nèle afisia la.
It’s the only thing that really makes sense.	Eya koe nye nu si me susu le ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Be a very, very good person.	Nye ame nyui ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
No one else can do that.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ ema o.
It didn’t surprise me at all.	Mewɔ nuku nam kura o.
Perhaps he is praying.	Ðewohĩ ele gbe dom ɖa.
And he’s not going to do it.	Eye mele ewɔ ge o.
And he lived to tell about it.	Eye wònɔ agbe gblɔ nu tso eŋu.
He stuck a mechanical heart to it.	Etsɔ mɔ̃ ƒe dzi aɖe ƒo ɖe eŋu.
That little man went on to do the most amazing things.	Ame sue ma yi edzi wɔ dɔ siwo wɔ nuku wu.
Or remove whatever it was on.	Alo ɖe nusianu si dzi wònɔ la ɖa.
What you say may be true.	Nya si nàgblɔ la ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
And that was just last week.	Eye kwasiɖa si va yi koe nye ema.
I don’t know what happened.	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ o.
It can’t be true, it can’t be true.	Mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o, mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
He is doing that more and more.	Ele ema wɔm geɖe wu.
He did nothing to try to impress people.	Mewɔ naneke tsɔ dze agbagba be yeawɔ dɔ ɖe amewo dzi o.
I tried to talk to him.	Medze agbagba be maƒo nu kplii.
Switch things back and forth between them.	Trɔ nuwo ɖe wo dome yi megbe.
Nothing was going on.	Naneke menɔ edzi yim o.
I should be releasing this in a week or two.	Ele be maɖe esia ɖe go le kwasiɖa ɖeka alo eve megbe.
Obviously, this is a very difficult problem.	Edze ƒã be esia nye kuxi sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
He fell down, man.	Edze anyi, ame.
He can’t live without me.	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe nye manɔmee o.
Table, table, table.	Taflatse, taflatse, taflatse.
Take a break, take a deep breath.	Gbɔ ɖe eme vie, gbɔ ya vie.
You can’t kill them.	Màte ŋu awu wo o.
I said too much about myself.	Megblɔ nu geɖe tso ɖokuinye ŋu akpa.
I just want your attention.	Ðeko medi wò susu.
The part on me.	Akpa si le dzinye.
However, this cannot be the case.	Ke hã, esia mate ŋu anɔ alea o.
I doubt that.	Meke ɖi nya ma.
I got you something too.	Mexɔ nane hã na wò.
I don’t know yet.	Nyemenya haɖe o.
This makes a lot of sense to me.	Susu le nya sia ŋu nam ŋutɔ.
Nobody did it anyway.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
Thinking about the things that matter.	Nu siwo le vevie la ŋu bubu.
Some really good ideas.	Susu nyui aɖewo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It seems to be the same this year.	Edze abe nenema ke wòle le ƒe sia hã me ene.
I do this.	Mewɔa esia.
Not after what had just happened.	Menye le nusi dzɔ teti koe nye ema megbe o.
Hold them now.	Lé wo ɖe asi fifia.
No one knows anything.	Ame aɖeke menya naneke o.
It was a happy day for all.	Enye ŋkeke si dzi amewo katã kpɔ dzidzɔ le.
He is playing a character.	Ele ame aɖe ƒe akpa aɖe wɔm.
Nothing close enough.	Naneke mete ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu ale gbegbe o.
But it was never like that.	Gake menɔ nenema kpɔ o.
The most popular statements are probably true.	Anɔ eme be nya siwo ame geɖe nya wu la nye nyateƒe.

Please, move there.	Taflatse, ʋu yi afima.
But he didn’t know that.	Gake menya nu ma o.
I will be ready.	Manɔ klalo.
Come here, come here.	Va afisia, va afisia.
It really had everything.	Nusianu nɔ eme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Today we will focus on simplicity.	Egbea míaƒe susu anɔ nuwo wɔwɔ bɔbɔe ŋu.
The case went on for months.	Nya la yi edzi ɣleti geɖe.
No one can help you.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò o.
That’s just my life.	Nye agbe koe nye ema.
I am like everyone else.	Mele abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
I came behind him.	Meva le megbe nɛ.
It’s like I have more than one man in me.	Ðeko wòle abe ŋutsu siwo wu ɖeka le menye ene.
There is a reason for this	Susu le esia me
That day has arrived.	Ŋkeke ma ɖo.
Hold on to it.	Lé eme ɖe asi.
It’s true, you know.	Enye nyateƒe, ènya.
Come and join us.	Va kpe ɖe mía ŋu.

I can promise you that.	Mate ŋu ado ŋugbe na wò nenema.
He had never been there.	Meva afima kpɔ o.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
The snake ran away.	Da la ƒu du dzo.
I just can’t understand it.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu ase egɔme o.
How to make your.	Ale si nàwɔ wò...
Something else could happen.	Nu bubu aɖe ate ŋu adzɔ.
In a job.	Le dɔ aɖe me.
He needed to be alone.	Ehiã be eya ɖeka nanɔ anyi.
So did he, the opposite way.	Nenema ke eya hã wɔe, mɔ si to vovo na ema.
For a very, very long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
However, on the face of it, this can’t be the case.	Ke hã, le eƒe mo la, esia mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
But this year things are different.	Gake le ƒe sia me la, nuwo to vovo.
I just can’t stand it.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu ado dzi o.
That didn’t occur to me.	Ema meva susu me nam o.
These people are important.	Ame siawo le vevie.
Maybe it will surprise us.	Ðewohĩ awɔ nuku na mí.
I would have done it differently.	Anye ne mawɔe le mɔ bubu nu hafi.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Each project is expected to take several years.	Wole mɔ kpɔm be dɔ ɖesiaɖe axɔ ƒe geɖe.
Up and down don’t matter.	Dzi kple anyi mehiã o.
Not a huge loss, really.	Menye nusi bu gã aɖee o, le nyateƒe me.
This may be true.	Esia ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
We all knew this moment would come.	Mí katã míenya be ɣeyiɣi sia ava.
That car needs service.	Ʋu ma hiã be woawɔ dɔ le eŋu.
It doesn’t seem to be the case anymore.	Edze abe megale nenema o ene.
He never stood still.	Metsi tre ɖe teƒe ɖeka gbeɖe o.
I’m still not sure what to do.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ dzi haɖe o.
He couldn’t lose her either.	Mete ŋu bu eya hã o.
But not anyone else.	Gake menye ame bubu aɖeke o.
There’s always that possibility .	Nusi ate ŋu adzɔ ma nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi .
You have nothing to say.	Wò nya aɖeke meli o.
I am doing something great.	Mele nu gã aɖe wɔm.
Many people believe this.	Ame geɖe xɔ esia dzi se.
He is looking at himself.	Ele eɖokui kpɔm.
I remember this moment like it was yesterday.	Meɖo ŋku ɣeyiɣi sia dzi abe etsɔ ene.
I wanted them.	Medi wo.
People seem to talk about them.	Edze abe amewo ƒoa wo nu ene.
I don’t know if his car was on fire.	Nyemenya ne dzo nɔ eƒe ʋua me o.
We just don’t know anything else.	Ðeko míenya nu bubu aɖeke o.
His strong hand.	Eƒe asi sesẽ la.
I have two of my own.	Nye ŋutɔ tɔ eve le asinye.
But, but, but.	Gake, gake, gake.
Many will be offended.	Ame geɖe ado dziku.
And two weeks later, he died too.	Eye le kwasiɖa eve megbe la, eya hã ku.
Do your job in all things.	Wɔ wò dɔ le nuwo katã me.
On one side at least.	Le akpa ɖeka ya teti.
I have made that very clear time and time again.	Megblɔ nya ma me kɔ ŋutɔ zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
This problem is minor.	Nu sue aɖe koe kuxi sia nye.
That’s the whole point of this.	Emae nye nya bliboa si le nya sia me.
No one else knew it existed.	Ame bubu aɖeke menya be ele o.
No one was at home.	Ame aɖeke menɔ aƒeme o.
The most appropriate thing.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ wu.
It never bothered him.	Meɖe fu nɛ kpɔ o.
He, knows who he is.	Eya, nya amesi wònye.
It can be present.	Ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
I don’t have any water.	Tsi aɖeke mele asinye o.
Use each of these moments.	Zã ɣeyiɣi sia dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe.
I just can’t go there right now.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu ayi afima fifia o.
They are being made now.	Wole wo wɔm fifia.
He wasn't ready for this, not at all.	Menɔ klalo na esia o, menye nenema kura o.
Have a nice day!.	Ŋkeke nyui aɖe na wò!.
I want to talk to you.	Medi be maƒo nu kpli wò.
I give you money, here.	Metsɔ ga na wò, le afisia.
I'd better keep watching.	Anyo be mayi edzi anɔ nu kpɔm.
I asked that question myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mebia nya ma.
It had two parts.	Akpa eve nɔ eŋu.
Turn your head away.	Trɔ wò ta ɖa.
But there are only a few of them.	Gake wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe li.
The car ran over his leg.	Ʋua ƒu du to eƒe afɔ dzi.
He has been sick for a long time.	Edze dɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
He almost liked her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ kloe.
And it never stayed.	Eye metsi anyi gbeɖe o.
At this time of the year.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
That’s just this one thing.	Nu ɖeka sia koe nye ema.
I feel your fire.	Mese wò dzo la le ɖokuinye me.
Which wasn’t there.	Nusi menɔ anyi o.
That was the last of them.	Emae nye wo dometɔ mamlɛtɔ.
Maybe it was just a long time ago.	Ðewohĩ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe koe nye esia.
I was just like you, too.	Nye hã menɔ abe wò ene.
And it’s a great thing.	Eye nu gã aɖee wònye.
And you can’t either.	Eye wò hã màte ŋui o.
He put his face to his hand.	Etsɔ eƒe mo ɖo eƒe asi ŋu.
I don’t know much about it.	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o.
I might want one.	Ðewohĩ madi ɖeka.
There are thousands of people like that.	Ame akpe geɖe li nenema.
That’s a fact.	Ema nye nyateƒe.
He faced them.	Edze ŋgɔ wo.
However, there are some issues.	Ke hã, nya aɖewo li.
Pay attention to technique and attitude.	Lé ŋku ɖe aɖaŋu kple nɔnɔme ŋu.
I wanted to do something difficult.	Medi be mawɔ nu sesẽ aɖe.
In short, he did everything.	Kpuie ko la, ewɔ nusianu.
I told you it wouldn’t be.	Megblɔ na mi be manɔ nenema o.
Talk to us about it.	Ƒo nu kpli mí.
I told him about you.	Megblɔ wò ŋu nya nɛ.
That will appeal to you, too.	Ema hã adzɔ dzi na wò.
He fell into the house.	Edze aƒe me.
Maybe you’re tired of it.	Ðewohĩ ɖeɖi te ŋuwò le eŋu.
Not bad and not great.	Menye nu gbegblẽ o eye menye gã o.
There is a fire here here.	Dzo aɖe le afisia le afisia.
This one-sided argument will not work.	Akpa ɖeka ƒe nya sia mawɔ dɔ o.
He’s lost his mind.	Eƒe susu megale eŋu o.
I can’t tell you how happy I am with them.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ ale si nye dzi dzɔ ɖe wo dzi la na mi o.
His hair is also very different.	Eƒe ɖa hã to vovo kura.
I want to know everything.	Medi be manya nusianu.
Nothing is very important.	Naneke mele vevie ŋutɔ o.
I remember this morning vividly.	Meɖo ŋku ŋdi sia dzi nyuie.
I often wonder why.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye zi geɖe be nukatae hã.
If only for a while.	Ne ɖe ɣeyiɣi aɖe koe.
A really great guy.	Ŋutsu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We can’t call him, not yet.	Míate ŋu aƒo ka nɛ o, menye haɖe o.
This speaks for itself.	Esia ƒoa nu le eɖokui si.
He has to get closer to it.	Ele be wòate ɖe eŋu.
There was no car either.	Ʋu aɖeke hã menɔ afima o.
And another, finished.	Eye bubu, wu enu.
I had no help last year.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke menɔ asinye le ƒe si va yi me o.
I can do it alone.	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔe.
I would do the same.	Nye hã mawɔe nenema.
He doesn’t have our help.	Míaƒe kpekpeɖeŋu mele esi o.
This works well for some.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie na ame aɖewo.
I actually did it.	Mewɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The atmosphere in that room was amazing.	Xɔ ma me ƒe nɔnɔme wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Enter.	Geɖe eme.
He won’t do anything.	Mawɔ naneke o.
It’s a normal thing.	Enye nusi sɔ.
He put his hand on it.	Etsɔ asi ɖo edzi.
This place is amazing beyond new.	Teƒe sia wɔ nuku wu yeye.
That’s a good thing.	Ema nye nu nyui aɖe.
This trick requires a little skill.	Aɖaŋu sia bia aɖaŋu sue aɖe.
But he may not do this.	Gake ɖewohĩ mawɔ esia o.
Between us, everything went through.	Le mía dome la, nusianu to eme.
We could have seen what could have happened.	Míate ŋu akpɔ nusi ate ŋu adzɔ hafi.
His face was all over them.	Eƒe mo nɔ wo katã ŋu.
Try a dish.	Te nuɖuɖu aɖe kpɔ.
This goes one of two ways.	Esia to mɔ eve dometɔ ɖeka dzi.
It will do that.	Awɔe nenema.
I think we have to act.	Mesusu be ele be míawɔ nu.
No one should do that.	Mele be ame aɖeke nawɔ ema o.
Contact me if you have any questions about this.	Te ɖe ŋunye ne èle nya aɖe biam tso esia ŋu.
There are some others.	Ame bubu aɖewo hã li.
But that’s enough.	Gake ema sɔ gbɔ.
I have a positive attitude.	Amewo ƒe susu nyui le asinye.
You have no chance with that.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke mele asiwò ɖe ema ŋu o.
This is still true.	Esia gakpɔtɔ nye nyateƒe.
I’m glad, for you, that he has one.	Edzɔ dzi nam, na wò, be ɖeka le esi.
Everything was ready.	Nusianu nɔ klalo.
That wasn’t so easy these days.	Ema menɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe le ŋkeke siawo me o.
Some of them, anyway.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I really want you.	Medi wò ŋutɔ.
This is a very good thing.	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
A life for a life.	Agbe aɖe na agbe aɖe.
We just know something is wrong when your heart stops.	Ðeko míenya be nane gblẽ esi wò dzi tɔ.
I am here now.	Mele afisia fifia.
For all of them.	Le wo katã ta.
I haven't had an issue in a long time.	Nyemekpɔ nya aɖeke o ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
You can look into it as much as you want.	Àte ŋu akpɔ eme alesi nèdi.
I’m here to get rid of them.	Meva afisia be maɖe wo ɖa.
It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
Ultimately, he will win.	Mlɔeba la, aɖu dzi.
Check it out.	Kpɔ eme ɖa.
Summer is coming.	Dzomeŋɔli gbɔna.
Move on with life.	Yi ŋgɔ kple agbe.
I was totally not ready for that at all.	Menɔ klalo kura na ema kura o.
But there was another side to it.	Gake akpa bubu aɖe hã nɔ eŋu.
They are all in the state of .	Wo katã wole nɔnɔme si nye .
I really need money.	Mehiã ga ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I can’t say much about it here yet.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe tso eŋu le afisia haɖe o.
A man does what is necessary.	Ŋutsu wɔa nu si hiã.
I think that explains it.	Mesusu be emae ɖe eme.
There is a lot of work to be done.	Dɔ geɖe li woawɔ be woawɔ esia.
Stay in the possibilities.	Nɔ nu siwo ate ŋu adzɔ me.
I was able to achieve this.	Mete ŋu ɖo esia gbɔ.
Everyone else knows, but not me.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe nya, gake nye ya menye o.
This dried up quickly.	Esia ƒu kaba.
I really don’t know.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya o.
Get out of this city.	Do go le du sia me.
It’s just mine.	Nye tɔ koe wònye.
Someone will answer.	Ame aɖe aɖo eŋu.
You’re going, you.	Wòe yi, wò.
That would be a waste of your time.	Ema anye wò ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
There are many jobs in this city.	Dɔ geɖe le du sia me.
Everything below me was tiny.	Nusianu si le nye te la nɔ sue ŋutɔ.
That's good.	Ema nyo.
Like before, there was never a name.	Abe tsã ene la, ŋkɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
There were no problems in these years.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ anyi le ƒe siawo me o.
Not sure how that would play out.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi ema awɔe dzi o.
I was very angry.	Medo dziku ŋutɔ.
One last thing.	Nu mamlɛtɔ ɖeka.
Which seems to be the case.	Nusi dze abe ɖe wòle nenema ene.
I wonder what is easier.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae le bɔbɔe wu hã.
I don’t know you at all.	Nyemenya wò kura o.
Try something completely new.	Te nu yeye kura kpɔ.
I kind of got close.	Meva te ɖe ŋunye le mɔ aɖe nu.
He can protect himself.	Ate ŋu akpɔ eɖokui ta.
I think there is something.	Mesusu be nane li.
That didn’t make sense to me.	Susu menɔ nya ma me nam o.
This is also a new development.	Esia hã nye nu yeye aɖe si dzɔ.
Add a little salt.	De dze vi aɖe eme.
Not so many people.	Menye ame geɖe nenema gbegbe o.
I can’t take anything else.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
I was just so angry with him.	Ðeko medo dziku ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe.
There was fire, he couldn’t run.	Dzo nɔ anyi, mete ŋu ƒu du o.
It doesn’t seem to be coming anytime soon.	Edze abe mava kpuie o ene.
We’re all doing good here.	Mí katã míele nyui wɔm le afisia.
I can do better.	Mate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu.
But it won’t come.	Gake mava o.
Some kind of car, anyway.	Ʋu ƒomevi aɖe, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe.
That’s amazing now.	Ema wɔ nuku fifia.
Whatever was wrong, that was me.	Nusianu si gblẽ la, nyee nye ema.
But that would be too easy.	Gake ema anɔ bɔbɔe akpa.
I did it once and I did.	Mewɔe zi ɖeka eye mewɔe hã.
They need to be treated fairly.	Ele be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu nyuie.
People understand this very well.	Amewo se esia gɔme nyuie ŋutɔ.
I say we each get a shot at this.	Megblɔ be mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe xɔa tu ɖeka le esia ŋu.
I know exactly where he is.	Menya afisi tututu wòle.
If it’s possible, you know, people will.	Ne anya wɔ la, ènya, amewo awɔe.
No one else ever said that.	Ame bubu aɖeke megblɔ nya ma kpɔ o.
His heart is there.	Eƒe dzi le afima.

Maybe he was really sick.	Ðewohĩ edze dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I can have it.	Ate ŋu anɔ asinye.
It will be about	Anɔ abe .
There appeared to be no blood in it.	Edze abe ʋu aɖeke menɔ eme o ene.
I couldn’t stand it.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
Police have yet to respond.	Kpovitɔwo mekpɔ ɖo nya sia ŋu haɖe o.
It’s a pleasure to be here.	Enye dzidzɔ nam be mele afisia.
It doesn't seem to be working.	Edze abe mele dɔ wɔm o ene.
Anything is possible.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
I seem to be making some kind of mistake.	Edze abe mele vodada aɖe ƒomevi me tom ene.
It’s a good part.	Enye akpa nyui aɖe.
I'm sure of it.	Meka ɖe edzi.
I don’t really want anything.	Nyemedi naneke ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
And that really means something.	Eye ema fia nane ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He couldn’t be sure.	Mete ŋu ka ɖe edzi o.
That was during the day.	Ema nye le ŋkeke me.
But things didn’t stay that way for long.	Gake nuwo menɔ nenema ɣeyiɣi didi o.
The meeting was a waste of time.	Kpekpea nye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
They have it all in their hands.	Wo katã le wo si me.
Anyone can say that.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu agblɔ nya ma.
Or not dead, in any case.	Alo menye kuku o, le go sia go me.
Maybe it’s because of money.	Ðewohĩ ga tae.
' age '.	' ƒe '.
That’s what’s different.	Emae nye nusi to vovo.
All these voices.	Gbe siawo katã.
There is no money involved.	Ga aɖeke mele eme o.
This is something we have to do.	Esia nye nusi wòle be míawɔ.
It’s too easy.	Ele bɔbɔe akpa.
Perhaps few will do so.	Ðewohĩ ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe awɔe nenema.
However, this is completely false.	Ke hã, esia nye alakpa kura.
Be careful what you wish for!	Kpɔ nyuie le nusi nèdi ŋu!
Just as he had expected.	Abe alesi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ ene.
Get out of it! 	Do go le eme!
Nor any horses.	Alo sɔ aɖeke hã o.
I have a mind.	Susu le ŋunye.
I understand why it’s important.	Mese nusita wòle vevie la gɔme.
Difficult, but not impossible.	Sesẽ, gake menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Only two people were missing.	Ame eve koe bu.
That would be a tough day.	Ema anye ŋkeke sesẽ aɖe.
Stay in them.	Nɔ wo me.
That’s about everything, kid.	Ema ku ɖe nusianu ŋu, ɖevi.
The only rule is that there are no rules.	Se ɖeka koe nye be se aɖeke meli o.
You can understand them.	Àte ŋu ase wo gɔme.
If only I could do it as well as you.	Ne ɖe mate ŋu awɔe nyuie abe wò ene.
He threw himself at them.	Etsɔ eɖokui ƒu gbe ɖe wo dzi.
But there could have been.	Gake ate ŋu anɔ anyi hafi.
He didn’t trust me.	Meka ɖe dzinye o.
It’s a really interesting place.	Enye teƒe si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There was something odd about him.	Nane si mewɔ nuku o nɔ eŋu.
Nothing matters.	Nya aɖeke mele vevie o.
It’s as simple as it gets.	Ele bɔbɔe abe alesi wòle ene.
None of us are there.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
It’s been very effective.	Ewɔ dɔ ŋutɔ.
That city offers a lot to offer.	Du ma na nu geɖe li woawɔ.
He just couldn’t concentrate on his work.	Ðeko mete ŋu tsɔ eƒe susu ɖo eƒe dɔa ŋu o.
Write at night.	Ŋlɔ nu le zã me.
That’s a big deal.	Nya gã aɖee nye ema.
But nothing came to mind.	Gake naneke meva susu me nam o.
I had no life before you.	Agbe aɖeke menɔ asinye do ŋgɔ na wò o.
And it was a great pleasure to meet you.	Eye enye dzidzɔ gã aɖe nam be medo go wò.
Keep up the good work.	Yi dɔ nyui la dzi.
It really isn’t a difficult task.	Le nyateƒe me la, menye dɔ sesẽ aɖee wònye o.
Is there any help? 	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖe li?

Today, it’s just you.	Egbea, wò koe.
He’s charming, but he’s charming.	Eƒe nu lé dzi na ame, gake eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
I did it anyway.	Mewɔe le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
It just didn’t do it for me.	Ðeko mewɔe nam o.
And it’s important.	Eye ele vevie.
I tried for a really long time.	Medze agbagba ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He did his job.	Ewɔ eƒe dɔ.
And of course that would be totally fine.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ema anyo kura.
Right now at this moment.	Fifia tututu le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
I am seriously here.	Mele afisia vevie.
He did the same thing.	Ewɔ nenema ke.
I just remember the whole thing being so amazing.	Ðeko meɖo ŋku edzi be nu bliboa wɔ nuku ale gbegbe.
It looked pretty great.	Edze nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
It’s that simple.	Ele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe.
What an incredible honor.	Bubu si mexɔ se o kae nye si.
There is no need to do wrong.	Mehiã nu gbegblẽ wɔwɔ o.
I highly doubt that.	Meke ɖi le nya ma ŋu ŋutɔ.
However, maybe once or twice it won’t be.	Ke hã, ɖewohĩ zi ɖeka alo zi eve la, manɔ nenema o.
Everyone ate heartily.	Amesiame ɖu nu tso dzi me.
Most likely another device.	Anɔ eme godoo be mɔ̃ bubu aɖee.
Everything was the same.	Nusianu nɔ ɖeka.
But you don’t have to work on it.	Gake mehiã be nàwɔ dɔ tso eŋu o.
There was something about him.	Nane nɔ eŋu.
One last time for you.	Zi mamlɛtɔ na wò.
I think you still can.	Mesusu be àte ŋui kokoko.
I almost fell over.	Medze anyi kloe.
I can’t seem to remember his name.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi o ene.
I have done a lot with him over the last few weeks.	Mewɔ nu geɖe kplii le kwasiɖa ʋɛ siwo va yi me.
This is really good.	Esia nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You only have enough time.	Ɣeyiɣi si sɔ gbɔ koe le asiwò.
There was much to do,	Nu geɖe nɔ anyi woawɔ, .
People do this.	Amewo wɔa esia.
He had something else on his mind.	Nu bubu aɖee nɔ susu me nɛ.
No one seemed to be able to help him.	Edze abe ame aɖeke mate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu o ene.
I could be dead wrong on this.	Mate ŋu anye vodada ku le nya sia ŋu.
You're not the head.	Wò ko ta.
It’s a fascinating thing.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame.
The matter is as follows.	Nya la le ale.
Something else, too.	Nu bubu aɖe hã.
I have a heart.	Dzi le asinye.
That’s no issue for you.	Ema menye nya aɖeke na wò o.
You may come across the following error.	Àte ŋu ava kpɔ vodada si gbɔna.
He really tried hard.	Edze agbagba vevie nyateƒe.
And we are going to win.	Eye míele dzi ɖu ge.
Or higher, he might want.	Alo esi kɔ wu, ate ŋu adi.
Which is completely absurd.	Nusi me susu mele kura o.
He has no job.	Dɔ aɖeke mele esi o.
I was a little surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nam vie.
We are in one now.	Míele ɖeka me fifia.
Some people just can’t.	Ðeko ame aɖewo mate ŋui o.
They are here.	Wole afisia.
Often more than one factor will be important.	Zi geɖe la, nu siwo wu ɖeka anɔ vevie.
Which is also a very, very good thing.	Nusi hã nye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
He was very satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme ŋutɔ.
You’re not alone.	Menye wò ɖeka koe o.
One fire, one water.	Dzo ɖeka, tsi ɖeka.
Few people will be there.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe anɔ afima.
His state of mind was clear.	Eƒe susu ƒe nɔnɔme me kɔ.
That other person	Ame bubu ma .
I just kind of got stuck.	Ðeko meva tsi eme le mɔ aɖe nu.
But it didn’t help.	Gake meɖe vi aɖeke o.
Everyone has this quality too.	Nɔnɔme sia hã le ame sia ame si.
He has you.	Wòe le esi.
They are on the road.	Wole mɔ dzi.
And the child, too.	Eye ɖevi la hã.
I had taken too much.	Mexɔ nu geɖe akpa kpɔ.
Tell him what he did to her.	Gblɔ nusi wòwɔ nɛ.
Freedom in life.	Vovo le agbe me.
I put my head down.	Metsɔ nye ta ɖo anyi.
He didn’t say anything about it.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke tso eŋu o.
But he couldn't think about that now.	Gake mete ŋu bu nya ma ŋu fifia o.
Just between you and me.	Le mía kpli wò dome ko.
Some of the people there remembered him well.	Ame siwo nɔ afi ma la dometɔ aɖewo ɖo ŋku edzi nyuie.
But the opposite happened.	Gake nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ.
But for everyone.	Gake na amesiame.
Many times many times.	Zi geɖe zi geɖe.
Please show proper respect.	Taflatse ɖe bubu si sɔ fia.
I couldn't see where you did this.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ afisi nèwɔ esia le o.
He had never done this before.	Mewɔ esia kpɔ o.
I don't have much time this afternoon.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele asinye le ŋdɔ sia me o.
I was doing good with it.	Menɔ nu nyui wɔm le eŋu.
But it will eventually get better.	Gake ava nyo ɖe edzi mlɔeba.
It should work fine now.	Ele be wòawɔ dɔ nyuie fifia.
How could it have happened? 	Aleke wòate ŋu adzɔ hafi?
That he can’t live without.	Ema si mate ŋu anɔ agbe kplii manɔmee o.
Anyone can do that.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu awɔ nu ma.
No one seems too worried about that.	Edze abe ame aɖeke metsi dzi ɖe ema ŋu akpa o ene.
Many people stood up for us.	Ame geɖe tsi tre ɖe mía ta.
I can’t handle this.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ o.
It’s not just an idea.	Menye susu aɖe koe wònye o.

He was surprised by the anger that rose in him.	Dziku si do mo ɖa le eme la wɔ nuku nɛ.
He didn’t look far ahead at all.	Mekpɔ ŋgɔ didi kura o.
He never did and he never will.	Mewɔe kpɔ o eye mawɔe hã gbeɖe o.

It was just one day.	Ŋkeke ɖeka koe wònye.
Some tribes are protected by law.	Se kpɔa to aɖewo ta.
I should know better.	Ele be manya nyuie wu.
I hope he does that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔe nenema.
I couldn’t stay.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ anyi o.
He is not eating.	Menye nu ɖum wòle o.
Or fight it.	Alo awɔ avu kplii.
There is nothing in it.	Naneke mele eme o.
It’s just not possible.	Ðeko manya wɔ o.
Now.	Fifia.
Give them some new clothes.	Na awu yeye aɖewo na wo.
Write something on it.	Ŋlɔ nane ɖe edzi.
He made no effort to fight it.	Medze agbagba aɖeke be yeawɔ avu kplii o.
It's such a different thing.	Enye nusi to vovo ale gbegbe.
Maybe that works for you, and that would be great if it did.	Ðewohĩ ema awɔ dɔ na wò, eye esia anyo ŋutɔ ne ewɔ dɔ.
There is one flaw though.	Vodada ɖeka le eme gake.
There is nothing in the car.	Naneke mele ʋua me o.
We know what one looks like.	Míenya alesi ame ɖeka le.
Otherwise it wouldn’t have been.	Ne menye nenema o la, anye ne manɔ nenema o.
I just can’t do anything.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
I’ve done it twice before.	Mewɔe zi eve va yi.
Everything was turned on its head.	Nusianu trɔ ɖe eƒe ta dzi.
There are so many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe ŋutɔ li.
None of them had ever seen or heard anything.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mekpɔ naneke kpɔ alo se naneke kpɔ o.
His voice rose as he went on.	Eƒe gbe dzi ɖe edzi esi wònɔ edzi yim.
Such a waste.	Gbegblẽ alea.
But something happened.	Gake nane dzɔ.
But there are factors working against this.	Gake nu aɖewo li siwo le dɔ wɔm tsi tre ɖe esia ŋu.
Who knows, it might work.	Amekae nya, ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
It’s a very good idea.	Enye susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
He enjoyed the work very much.	Dɔa do dzidzɔ nɛ ŋutɔ.
Let’s try a new strategy.	Mina míate aɖaŋu yeye aɖe kpɔ.
He really didn’t care about me.	Le nyateƒe me la, metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam o.
It was a great job.	Dɔ gã aɖee wònye.
It’s obvious.	Edze ƒã.
This is very worthy of me.	Esia dze nam ŋutɔ.
You can check this out.	Àte ŋu akpɔ esia ɖa.
We don’t know what he did, or didn’t do.	Míenya nusi wòwɔ, alo nusi mewɔ o.
So, take a look at it.	Eya ta, lé ŋku ɖe eŋu.
Just have one on hand.	Ðeko ɖeka nanɔ asiwò.
Perhaps he will say his name.	Ðewohĩ agblɔ eƒe ŋkɔ.
It didn’t exist.	Menɔ anyi o.
I knew what they were giving me, anyway.	Menya nusi wole nam, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
That makes a little sense perhaps.	Susu le nya ma me vie ɖewohĩ.
People he might not have.	Ame siwo ɖewohĩ manɔ esi o.
I think it’s possible.	Mesusu be anya wɔ.
His hand clamped down on her neck.	Eƒe asi ƒo ɖe eƒe kɔ ŋu.
His reputation will prove it strongly.	Ŋkɔ nyui si le eŋu la aɖo kpe edzi sesĩe.
There is plenty to do here for all ages.	Nu geɖe li woawɔ le afisia na ƒe ɖesiaɖe.
Perhaps he had other plans.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ ɖoɖo bubu aɖewo hã.
We cannot live without water.	Míate ŋu anɔ agbe tsi manɔmee o.
And everyone, really.	Eye amesiame, le nyateƒe me.
Now that was in his hands too.	Fifia ema hã nɔ eƒe asi me.
I needed to talk to him.	Ehiã be maƒo nu kplii.
Doing nothing.	Naneke wɔwɔ o.
It didn’t surprise me at all.	Mewɔ nuku nam kura o.
It was just everything.	Nusianu koe wònye.
This market is usually busy in the morning.	Zi geɖe la, amewo nɔa asi sia me le ŋdi me.
I'll tell you when.	Magblɔ ɣekaɣie na wò.
This place made sense to him.	Susu nɔ teƒe sia nɛ.
It was their last chance.	Enye mɔnukpɔkpɔ mamlɛtɔ na wo.
Surprisingly, he didn’t remember.	Ewɔ nuku be meɖo ŋku edzi o.
All sorts of things.	Nu ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe.
He cannot put these things together.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu siawo nu ƒu ɖekae o.
Now cover his face.	Fifia xɔ eƒe mo.
He can do what he likes with it.	Ate ŋu awɔ nu si dze eŋu kplii.
But now, it’s a real challenge for you.	Gake fifia, enye kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ na wò.
A good night, actually.	Zã nyui aɖe, le nyateƒe me.
There was a rule for everything.	Se aɖe nɔ anyi na nusianu.
It won’t bother him.	Maɖe fu nɛ o.
There is nothing in sight.	Naneke mele ŋku me o.
But we are here.	Gake míele afisia.
That would be another book.	Ema anye agbalẽ bubu.
It shouldn’t surprise us.	Mele be wòawɔ nuku na mí o.
Everything should be working now.	Ele be nusianu nanɔ dɔ wɔm fifia.
However, we can work on that.	Ke hã, míate ŋu awɔ dɔ tso ema ŋu.
Which is definitely not true.	Nusi menye nyateƒe o godoo.
', or yi '.	', alo yi '.
But I have to have something in me to do it.	Gake ele be nane le menye be mawɔe.
There are two reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo li siwo tae wòle alea ɖo.
However, our work does not neutralize these processes.	Gake míaƒe dɔa meɖe akpa aɖeke ɖa le ɖoɖo siawo ŋu o.
Recruit, recruit, recruit.	Xɔ amewo ɖe dɔ me, xɔ amewo ɖe dɔ me, xɔ amewo ɖe dɔ me.
This thing will work, right?	Nu sia awɔ dɔ, alo?
But open your mind just a little bit.	Gake ʋu wò susu vie ko.
No one seems to want to do that.	Edze abe ame aɖeke medi be yeawɔ nu ma o ene.
But I’m not doing everything either.	Gake nye hã nyemele nusianu wɔm o.
Two means something.	Eve fia nane.
Not necessarily a good thing.	Menye nu nyui aɖee wònye kokoko o.
Every night.	Zã sia zã.
I just work hard for myself.	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ sesĩe na ɖokuinye.
It can only be one person.	Ame ɖeka koe ate ŋu anye.
Still, do something for me.	Ke hã, wɔ nane nam.
I just wasn’t sure.	Ðeko nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
It was too late at night.	Zã me tsi akpa.
This for me and me.	Esia na nye kple nye.
Things are a little different today though.	Nuwo to vovo vie egbea ya.
And yet it worked well.	Eye ke hã ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
I was able to say some things briefly.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nya aɖewo kpuie.
I think it’s absolutely necessary.	Mesusu be ehiã vevie ŋutɔ.
He can hit anything.	Ate ŋu aƒo nusianu.
That doesn’t matter too much.	Ema mehiã vevie akpa o.
I listened carefully.	Meɖo to nyuie.
That’s not all there is to it.	Menye ema koe nye ema o.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ema menye nu gbegblẽ o.
Everything surprised me.	Nusianu wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
There is a point.	Nya aɖe li.
He didn’t know what to do.	Menya nusi wòle be wòawɔ o.
Now, we didn’t have a plan.	Fifia, ɖoɖo aɖeke menɔ mía si o.
It’s not a real thing.	Menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖee o.
He, knowing this, said nothing.	Eya, si nya esia la, megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
This is really quite simple.	Esia le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You can do this in many ways.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia le mɔ geɖe nu.
It is important for many reasons.	Susu geɖe tae wòle vevie ɖo.
Who, of course, knew nothing.	Esi, le nyateƒe me la, menya naneke o.
I had to be there.	Ele be manɔ afima.
He had never heard anything at night.	Mese naneke le zã me kpɔ o.
I can’t live anywhere near this.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afi aɖeke si te ɖe esia ŋu o.
He was very interested in me.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme nam ŋutɔ.
Or find them.	Alo akpɔ wo.
A few people did that.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo wɔe nenema.
But it’s not working.	Gake mele dɔ wɔm o.
I don’t really understand that.	Nyemese nya ma gɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
There are some things that no one can escape.	Nu aɖewo li siwo me ame aɖeke mate ŋu asi le o.
These devices are not too popular.	Mɔ̃ siawo mexɔ ŋkɔ akpa o.
In fact, there is nothing.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke meli o.
No one can do it.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋui o.
Now everything is over.	Fifia la, nusianu wu enu.
Two men met.	Ŋutsu eve do go.
But other than that, nothing.	Gake ne menye nenema o la, naneke meli o.
We are not just another face.	Menye mo bubu aɖe koe míenye o.
I am on my way back now.	Mele mɔ dzi trɔ gbɔ fifia.
And of course, it’s a legal one.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, enye esi le se nu.
Only, it won’t.	Ðeko, mawɔe nenema o.
But we can at least say this.	Gake míate ŋu agblɔ nya sia ya teti.
You have to do what you want.	Ele be nàwɔ nusi dim nèle.
The one he was looking for.	Ame si dim wònɔ.
But not for long.	Gake menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
If this continues and I think it will.	Ne esia yi edzi eye mesusu be awɔe nenema.
Not sure what this is about.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi ŋu nya sia ku ɖo dzi o.
I have reached this point.	Meɖo afisia afisia.
It didn't bu.	Ga la bu.
It worked, for a few days.	Ewɔ dɔ, ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo.
I had time for them for once.	Ɣeyiɣi nɔ asinye na wo zi ɖeka.
He is an independent eye like me.	Enye ŋku si le eɖokui si abe nye ene.
Not in life.	Menye le agbe me o.
Whatever happens, everyone knows about it.	Nusianu si adzɔ la, amesiame nya nu tso eŋu.
I like that about you.	Ema dzɔa dzi nam le ŋuwò.
But in many cases it doesn’t matter.	Gake le go geɖe me la, mehiã o.
The literature on this subject is extensive.	Agbalẽ siwo ƒo nu tso nya sia ŋu la sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
He desperately needed help.	Ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu vevie.
A real book.	Agbalẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe.
That’s pretty much the current plan.	Emae nye ɖoɖo si li fifia kloe.
I'm so ready for you.	Me le klalo na wò ale gbegbe.
I saw these guys.	Mekpɔ ŋutsu siawo.
This year, next year, or who knows what year.	Ƒe sia me, ƒe si gbɔna, alo amekae nya ƒe si me.
Neither of us said anything.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
He only has to do one or two people.	Ame ɖeka alo eve koe wòle be wòawɔ.
It just didn’t do that.	Ðeko mewɔe nenema o.
He just wasn’t there.	Ðeko menɔ afima o.
But we’re not going to discuss it with you right now.	Gake míele eŋu bu ge kpli wò fifia o.
But it worked.	Gake ewɔ dɔ.
I believe in the man you are.	Mexɔ ŋutsu si nènye la dzi se.
It worked really well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He won’t, he can’t.	Mawɔe o, mate ŋui o.
Many people were lost.	Ame geɖe bu.
It was a machine.	Mɔ̃ aɖee wònye.
People were furious.	Amewo do dziku vevie.
Which is an oddity.	Nusi nye nusi mewɔ nuku o.
Many people have done so.	Ame geɖe wɔe nenema.
In fact, this is true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nya sia nye nyateƒe.
That’s a big deal.	Nya gã aɖee nye ema.
I probably could have gone smaller, but that seems about right.	Anɔ eme be mate ŋu ayi sue wu hafi, gake edze abe nya ma sɔ ene.
People ran away.	Amewo ƒu du dzo.
A name is just one word.	Nya ɖeka koe ŋkɔ nye.
But you were there.	Gake wòe nɔ afima.
That would work just as well.	Ema hã awɔ dɔ nyuie nenema ke.
It's just right at the same time.	Ðeko wòle eteƒe le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me.
I can get them for you.	Mate ŋu axɔ wo na wò.
I just want to see what happened to them.	Ðeko medi be makpɔ nusi dzɔ ɖe wo dzi.
Do some people have a question.	Ðe nya aɖe le ame aɖewo si.
All these tasks are plaguing his subconscious.	Dɔ siawo katã le fu ɖem na eƒe susu te.
But he can do this.	Gake ate ŋu awɔ esia.
Which is not a lie.	Nusi menye alakpa o.
Everything was going on.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim.
But it isn’t either.	Gake mele nenema hã o.
There is really nothing I can do.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke meli mawɔ o.
He couldn’t see me.	Mete ŋu kpɔm o.
Find a job that is a good fit for you.	Di dɔ si sɔ na wò nyuie.
In this way.	Le mɔ sia nu.
Some things are wrong.	Nu aɖewo gblẽ.
There has to be a mistake.	Ele be vodada aɖe nanɔ anyi.
No blood was seen.	Ʋu aɖeke medze o.
I will continue this once I get home.	Mayi esia dzi ne meɖo aƒeme ko.
Take a good look at these ships.	Lé ŋku ɖe meli siawo ŋu nyuie.
But nothing came true for him.	Gake nya aɖeke meva eme nɛ o.
I was behind him.	Menɔ megbe nɛ.
We can live with it.	Míate ŋu anɔ agbe kplii.
I wasn’t happy.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
I want to work with you.	Medi be mawɔ dɔ kpli wò.
I have my own car.	Nye ŋutɔ nye ʋu le asinye.
He had a gun in his hand.	Tu nɔ esi le esi.
Some of them are very expensive.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Water in the background.	Tsi le megbe.
He has to do what he has to do.	Ele be wòawɔ nu si wòle be wòawɔ.
Two people offered me a job.	Ame eve tsɔ dɔ aɖe nam.
Use whatever you feel comfortable with.	Zã nusianu si me wò dzi dze eme le.
How many years? 	Ƒe nenie?
He took some of them.	Etsɔ wo dometɔ aɖewo.
He was too pleased.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ akpa.
Now be a good person.	Azɔ nye ame nyui.
Maybe that’s just as well.	Ðewohĩ ema hã nyo nenema ke.
No one wants anything.	Ame aɖeke medi naneke o.
I don't know what caused this.	Nyemenya nusi gbɔ esia tso o.
It’s something.	Enye nu aɖe.
He is doing what he likes now.	Ele nusi dze eŋu la wɔm fifia.
Everything was the same for us.	Nusianu nɔ ɖeka na mí.
Anything is possible.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
They are looking for a new home.	Wole aƒe yeye dim.
I would have liked to have had a little longer.	Anye ne madi be ɣeyiɣi didi vie nanɔ asinye hafi.
We had a couple of problems.	Kuxi eve aɖewo nɔ mía ŋu.
It’s just as hard.	Sesẽ nenema ke.
I needed to be there with him.	Ehiã be manɔ afima ɖe ye gbɔ.
In every case.	Le go ɖesiaɖe me.
It would have been a minor thing.	Anye ne anye nu sue aɖe ko hafi.
People just expect the same thing.	Ðeko amewo kpɔa mɔ na nu ma ke.
It’s not a plan or strategy.	Menye ɖoɖo alo aɖaŋu aɖee wònye o.
This is not consistent.	Esia mewɔa ɖeka o.
That thing is a problem.	Nu ma nye kuxi.
It’s not working for some reason.	Menye ɖe wòle dɔ wɔm le susu aɖewo ta o.
Run away from the dog.	Si le avu la nu.
He didn’t like it.	Eƒe nu medze eŋu o.
No one understood it.	Ame aɖeke mese egɔme o.
That sounds like a serious problem.	Ema ɖi kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
However, there is still a problem.	Ke hã, kuxi aɖe gakpɔtɔ li.
One thought suggested another.	Susu ɖeka do susu bubu ɖa.
That's why.	Ema tae.
It just doesn’t work.	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ o.
You don’t have a long career.	Menye dɔ didi aɖee le asiwò o.
His voice came back.	Eƒe gbe trɔ gbɔ.
Everything was fine.	Nusianu nɔ nyuie.
This work is valuable and important.	Dɔ sia xɔ asi eye wòle vevie.
There is nothing he can do.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ o.
Nothing was easy.	Naneke menɔ bɔbɔe o.
Go with him.	Yi kplii.
Your real self.	Wò ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is a wonderful idea.	Esia nye susu si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I worked on this.	Mewɔ dɔ tso esia ŋu.
I'm sorry, man.	Meɖe kuku, ŋutsu.
I was also satisfied.	Nye hã nye dzi dze eme.
I hope some of these books do that for you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be agbalẽ siawo dometɔ aɖewo awɔe nenema na wò.
No one can make me do them.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu ana mawɔ wo o.
That's why.	Eya tae.
It was a pleasure to be there.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be menɔ afima.
Here’s a reason! 	Susu aɖee nye esi!
Or maybe nothing more.	Alo ɖewohĩ nu bubu aɖeke manɔ esi wu.
Yet he didn’t do it for us.	Ke hã mewɔe na mí o.
My people	Nye amewo .
I was home all week.	Meva aƒeme kwasiɖa bliboa katã.
I have said the same thing many times myself.	Nye ŋutɔ hã megblɔ nya ma ke zi geɖe.
He didn’t answer me.	Meɖo nya aɖeke ŋu nam o.
Several conclusions can be drawn from these statements.	Míate ŋu aƒo nya ta geɖe tso nya siawo me.
He seemed to be talking to himself.	Edze abe ɖe wònɔ nu ƒom na eɖokui ene.
It is that, as long as you’re here for that.	Enye ema, zi alesi nèle afisia ɖe ema ta ko.
That won’t work this time.	Ema mawɔ dɔ zi sia o.
It can certainly be almost anything.	Ate ŋu anye nusianu kloe godoo.
Everyone should do that.	Ele be amesiame nawɔ ema.
One shot dropped.	Tu ɖeka aɖe ɖi.
Some people did it.	Ame aɖewo wɔe.
This man	Ŋutsu sia .
I understand your stuff prior to and you are just great.	Mese wò nuwo gɔme do ŋgɔ na eye nèle gã ŋutɔ ko.
Expect this process to take at least a month.	Kpɔ mɔ be dɔ sia wɔwɔ axɔ ɣleti ɖeka ya teti.
Not on its own.	Menye le eɖokui si o.
It looked like a completely different room.	Edze abe xɔ si to vovo kura ene.
Find that joy.	Di dzidzɔ ma.
But you can’t talk to someone you don’t know at all.	Gake màte ŋu aɖo dze kple ame aɖe si mènya kura o.
I don’t know if anyone wins, if anyone dies.	Nyemenya ne ame aɖe ɖu dzi o, ne ame aɖe ku o.
The air is not like that.	Ya mele nenema o.
But it doesn’t do what you want in this case.	Gake mewɔa nusi nèdi le go sia me o.
This is really important to us.	Esia le vevie na mí ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We’re in this together.	Míele esia me ɖekae.
There wasn’t much space inside.	Teƒe boo aɖeke menɔ eme o.
I am interested in people.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na amewo.
Teeth.	Aɖu wò.
Let me know if you have any questions.	Na manya ne nya aɖe le asiwò.
To some extent.	Va ɖo afi aɖe.
For you...	Na wò...
I think that’s appropriate.	Mesusu be esia sɔ.
But this is not the case.	Gake esia mele nenema o.
The lake had no name.	Ŋkɔ aɖeke menɔ ta la ŋu o.
He never told me this.	Megblɔ nya sia nam kpɔ o.
Something is definitely better than nothing.	Nane nyo wu naneke godoo.
People know this place.	Amewo nya teƒe sia.
I can work all day.	Mete ŋu wɔa dɔ ŋkeke bliboa.
That’s good news at least.	Nya nyui aɖee nye ema ya teti.
I will be looking forward to you.	Manɔ mɔ kpɔm na wò.
I did see theirs.	Mekpɔ wo tɔ ya.
They are clearly behind us.	Wole megbe na mí eme kɔ ƒã.
We seem to be doing well so far.	Edze abe míele edzi dzem nyuie vaseɖe fifia ene.
I need some help.	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo.
I sent it up.	Meɖoe ɖe dzi.
Our house is not the same without her.	Míaƒe aƒea mele abe eya manɔmee ene o.
You, on the other hand, are a completely different case.	Le go bubu me la, wò ya nye nya si to vovo kura.
We need to be brave.	Ele be dzi nanɔ mía ƒo.
But in reality.	Gake le nyateƒe me.
None of them matter.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele vevie o.
You only have one life.	Agbe ɖeka koe le asiwò.
Maybe he’ll talk to her.	Ðewohĩ aƒo nu kplii.
Maybe it’s too new.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ yeye akpa.
I can’t let this go.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le esia ŋu o.
This can take a very long time.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ.
I don’t expect them to make one though.	Nyemele mɔ kpɔm be woawɔ ɖeka o gake.
Attack.	Dze avu.
If only things had turned out differently.	Ne ɖe nuwo va dzɔ le mɔ bubu nu hafi.
This is difficult.	Esia sesẽ.
Everything alive here seems to come from here.	Edze abe nusianu si le agbe le afisia la tso afisia ene.
It looks like death.	Edze abe ku ene.
The point is correct.	Nya la sɔ.
Not very likely.	Menye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ ŋutɔ o.
Some people do this often.	Ame aɖewo wɔa esia zi geɖe.
But please, please come back tomorrow.	Gake taflatse, taflatse trɔ va etsɔ.
Anything is possible there.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ le afima.
More than enough is enough.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ wu esi sɔ gbɔ.
After a few months.	Le ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo megbe.
And it’s very simple.	Eye wòle bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
His hand went to her mouth.	Eƒe asi yi eƒe nu gbɔ.
Not in a week.	Menye le kwasiɖa ɖeka me o.
I was in your hands.	Nyee nɔ asiwò.
If only that were the case.	Ne ɖe nya la le nenema ko la.
Now the previous one is false.	Azɔ esi do ŋgɔ la nye alakpa.
And so this is for you.	Eye ale esia nye na mi.
There is a lot to do.	Nu geɖe li woawɔ.
I think that’s you.	Mesusu be wòe nye ema.
You don’t seem to have any.	Edze abe ɖeke mele asiwò o ene.
He was probably the only one alive.	Anɔ eme be eya ɖeka koe nɔ agbe.
It seemed like a long time ago.	Edze abe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye ema ene.
Spend an hour or two.	Zã gaƒoƒo ɖeka alo eve.
So far this works great.	Vaseɖe fifia la, esia wɔa dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
He didn’t believe us.	Mexɔ mía dzi se o.
It’s not easier.	Menye ɖe wòle bɔbɔe wu o.
It had many extremes, not just one or two.	Nu geɖe siwo gbɔ eme nɔ eŋu, ke menye ɖeka alo eve ko o.
I was almost there actually.	Meɖo afima kloe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But now things have suddenly changed.	Gake fifia la, nuwo trɔ zi ɖeka.
We are going to die.	Míele kuku ge.
I have been working on it.	Mele dɔ wɔm tso eŋu kpɔ.
They all make sense.	Susu le wo katã me.
But we can’t go on like this.	Gake míate ŋu ayi edzi alea o.
Now come here.	Azɔ va afisia.
But that quickly changed.	Gake ema trɔ kaba.
You can see what it did to him.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusi wòwɔ ɖe eŋu.
Type your wish string.	Ŋlɔ wò didi ƒe ka.
No one can be so happy.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ nenema gbegbe o.
So far, it hasn’t.	Vaseɖe fifia la, mewɔe nenema o.
I just introduced myself.	Ðeko meɖe ɖokuinye fia.
That always speaks to me.	Ema ƒoa nu nam ɣesiaɣi.
I would have said the same thing.	Anye ne megblɔ nya ma ke hafi.
It’s a difficult issue.	Enye nya sesẽ aɖe.
But we can talk about that separately.	Gake míate ŋu aƒo nu tso ema ŋu ɖe vovo.
I grew up very seriously.	Metsi vevie ŋutɔ.
That’s not a big deal either.	Ema hã menye nya gã aɖeke o.
He will take care of the little one.	Akpɔ ɖevi sue la dzi.
I have every word.	Nya ɖesiaɖe le asinye.
I was in a good mood.	Menɔ nɔnɔme nyui aɖe me.
It is easy to follow.	Ele bɔbɔe be woawɔ ɖe edzi.
I’ve seen you.	Mekpɔ wò.
I felt it in myself.	Mese le ɖokuinye me.
But that’s enough.	Gake ema sɔ gbɔ.
The gunman had a gun in his hand.	Tu aɖe nɔ ŋutsu si tsɔ tu ɖe asi la ɖe asi.
Good mental attitude.	Susu ƒe nɔnɔme nyui.
Not now, too soon.	Menye fifia o, kaba akpa.
No one really knew what was going on.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi nɔ edzi yim ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I just don’t know why a man would say that.	Ðeko nyemenya nusita ŋutsu aɖe agblɔ nya ma o.
I don’t really know anything.	Nyemenya naneke ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
The nice guy asks what he can do for her.	Ŋutsu nyui la bia nusi wòate ŋu awɔ nɛ.
Just in my imagination.	Le nye susu me ko.
He has never been able to prove himself.	Mete ŋu ɖo kpe eɖokui dzi kpɔ o.
No one is here now.	Ame aɖeke mele afisia fifia o.
But we have no time or space for that.	Gake ɣeyiɣi alo teƒe aɖeke mele mía si na ema o.
This too will not happen overnight.	Esia hã mava eme le ŋkeke ɖeka me o.
You can’t go out tonight.	Màte ŋu ado go le zã sia me o.
Every part, every thing.	Akpa ɖesiaɖe, nu ɖesiaɖe.
His own certainly never was.	Eya ŋutɔ tɔ menɔ nenema kpɔ o godoo.
I have nothing to do.	Nu aɖeke mele asinye mawɔ o.
Yet there is a redemption.	Ke hã nu aɖe li si axɔ na esia.
You haven’t been in it that long.	Mèle eme ɣeyiɣi didi nenema gbegbe o.
He seems to be on his way.	Edze abe ele mɔ dzi ene.
And that was very bad.	Eye ema gblẽ nu ŋutɔ.

It would have been great.	Anye ne anyo ŋutɔ hafi.
Yet they are here.	Ke hã wole afisia.

You can’t say anything.	Màte ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke o.
He can travel in them too.	Ate ŋu azɔ mɔ le wo hã me.
And it’s great.	Eye wònye gã.
Many people rushed to the house.	Ame geɖe ƒu du yi aƒea me.
A new reality set in.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ yeye aɖe va dzɔ.
This means, of course, that	Esia fia ya be .
They just have to do a few things.	Ele be woawɔ nu ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
Not so much as it is.	Menye nenema gbegbe o.
I need to find a job that I enjoy.	Ele be madi dɔ si doa dzidzɔ nam.
If there is no name, no name is needed.	Ne ŋkɔ aɖeke meli o la, ke ŋkɔ aɖeke mehiã o.
A period of time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe ƒe ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
There is only one problem.	Kuxi ɖeka koe li.
You or he can get a job.	Wò ŋutɔ alo eya ate ŋu akpɔ dɔ.
But there was no plan.	Gake ɖoɖo aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Not force them, ask them.	Menye zi wo dzi o, bia wo.
That means we have to fight it harder than ever.	Ema fia be ele be míawɔ avu kplii sesĩe wu tsã.
And we’re not there.	Eye míele afima o.
You have to act now.	Ele be nàwɔ nu fifia.
I didn’t like that.	Ema medze ŋunye o.
I was really happy.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ nyateƒe.
You have two problems.	Kuxi eve le ŋuwò.
I’m glad that’s you and not me.	Edzɔ dzi nam be wòe nye ema ke menye nyee o.
This could be the biggest surprise of all.	Esia ate ŋu anye nusi awɔ nuku na ame wu ɖesiaɖe.
Not for very long.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi boo aɖeke o.
He made a mistake.	Ewɔ vodada aɖe.
That ended that little problem.	Ema na kuxi sue ma wu enu.
This school has a good reputation.	Ŋkɔ nyui aɖe le suku sia ŋu.
I'll meet you.	Mado go wò.
It’s a part of it.	Eƒe akpa aɖe.
You don’t have money for a house.	Ga mele asiwò na aƒe o.
Look at my dog!	Kpɔ nye avu ɖa!
Maybe it will be useful for me now.	Ðewohĩ aɖe vi nam fifia.
Yet it still doesn’t work.	Ke hã mewɔa dɔ kokoko o.
I knew two of them a little.	Menya wo dometɔ eve vie.
Take a closer look.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie.
Now you can answer.	Fifia àte ŋu aɖo nya ŋu.
We can all do that, or something like that.	Mí katã míate ŋu awɔ ema, alo nane si le abe esia ene.
I think you will enjoy this book.	Mesusu be agbalẽ sia ado dzidzɔ na wò.
And maybe someone still is.	Eye ɖewohĩ ame aɖe gakpɔtɔ li.
The night is over.	Zã la wu enu.
And maybe it is.	Eye ɖewohĩ ele nenema.
Our room was ready quickly and in great shape.	Míaƒe xɔa nɔ klalo kaba eye wònɔ nɔnɔme nyui aɖe me.
But he wouldn’t let go of his eye.	Gake maɖe asi le eƒe ŋku ŋu o.
I never really understood what to expect.	Nyemese nusi tututu makpɔ mɔ na gɔme kpɔ o.
You have to do something with it. 	Ele be nàwɔ nane kplii. 
Eye to eye with the eye.	Ŋku ɖe ŋku ŋu.
Fire with his head!	Dzo kple eƒe ta!
This will be my job.	Esia anye nye dɔ.
It’s very expensive.	Xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
The night was very difficult.	Zã la sesẽ ŋutɔ.
There is nothing in it yet.	Naneke mele eme haɖe o.
This may be the first of its kind.	Esia ate ŋu anye gbãtɔ le esia ƒomevi me.
That’s none of your business.	Ema menye wò nya aɖeke o.

I really wanted a house, and I found one.	Medi aƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ, eye mekpɔ ɖeka.

He won’t see anything else.	Makpɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
Beware of them.	Kpɔ nyuie le wo ŋu.
It will be strictly enforced.	Woawɔ ɖe edzi vevie.
I know this is true.	Menya be nya sia nye nyateƒe.
That statement is true.	Nya ma nye nyateƒe.
We can be that way.	Míate ŋu anye nenema.
And think about one thing.	Eye bu nu ɖeka ŋu bubu.
It suddenly seemed so simple.	Edze abe ɖe wòle bɔbɔe ŋutɔ ene zi ɖeka.
How can you let him do this?'	Aleke nàwɔ aɖe mɔ nɛ wòawɔ esia?’.
Have some extra hands.	Asi bubu aɖewo nanɔ asiwò.
This could be over.	Esia ate ŋu awu enu.
It is a system.	Enye ɖoɖo aɖe.
Not once at least.	Menye zi ɖeka ya teti o.
Which is kind of.	Nusi wònye ƒomevi.
This in itself is not surprising.	Esia ŋutɔ mewɔ nuku o.
Something like that.	Nane si le abe ema ene.
He needs his time to be a kid.	Ehiã eƒe ɣeyiɣi hafi wòate ŋu anye ɖevi.
I am very realistic.	Mewɔa nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
It’s as much a part of life as anything else.	Enye agbe ƒe akpa aɖe abe nu bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
In this case, there is only one condition.	Le go sia me la, nɔnɔme ɖeka koe li.
Trust me to know what is best for you.	Ka ɖe dzinye be manya nusi anyo na wò.
This shouldn’t be that surprising.	Mele be esia nawɔ nuku na ame nenema gbegbe o.
I know you, now.	Menya wò, fifia.
We know that they are.	Míenya be wole nenema.
The result was absolutely amazing.	Nusi do tso eme la wɔ nuku kura.
This struck him as odd.	Esia wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
And he was on his own.	Eye wònɔ eɖokui si.
You can go wild now.	Àte ŋu ayi gbe me fifia.

If only it had been.	Ne ɖe wònye nenema.

We have to take action.	Ele be míawɔ nu.
One person cannot play every role.	Ame ɖeka mate ŋu awɔ akpa ɖesiaɖe o.
This house is dirty.	Aƒe sia ƒo ɖi.
And there is only one more important.	Eye ɖeka koe li si le vevie wu.
Now you have my attention.	Fifia nye susu le asiwò.
Nowadays, people are aware of these problems.	Fifia la, amewo nya nu tso kuxi siawo ŋu.

It is located nearby.	Ele teƒe aɖe si te ɖe afima ŋu.
This should not surprise us.	Mele be esia nawɔ nuku na mí o.
Many people alive deserve to die.	Ame geɖe siwo le agbe la dze na ku.
How can we help these people?	Aleke míate ŋu akpe ɖe ame siawo ŋu?
There were two parts to it.	Akpa eve nɔ eme.
And that’s a little weird.	Eye esia nye nusi wɔ nuku vie.

Please hurry up.	Taflatse wɔ kaba.
I can’t do it today.	Nyemate ŋui egbea o.

And a good one, at that.	Eye nyui aɖe, le ema me.

He looked like him, and that was enough.	Edze abe eya ene, eye ema sɔ gbɔ.
You have to fight them.	Ele be nàwɔ avu kpli wo.
Things could have gone differently.	Nuwo ate ŋu ayi mɔ bubu nu hafi.
He needed to make his own way in life.	Ehiã be wòawɔ eya ŋutɔ ƒe mɔ le agbe me.
I didn’t feel old.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be mexɔ ƒe o.
His head is clearer now.	Eƒe ta me kɔ nyuie wu fifia.
I was so hot.	Mexɔ dzo ale gbegbe.
It makes sense in a way.	Susu le eme le mɔ aɖe nu.
I would define it as you.	Maɖe egɔme be wò ŋutɔ nènye.

This guy does a good job here.	Ŋutsu sia wɔa dɔ nyuie le afisia.
It is actually a great book.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye agbalẽ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Here, take this.	Le afisia la, tsɔ esia.
He is testing you.	Ele wò dom kpɔ.
It is impossible to work.	Manya wɔ be woawɔ dɔ o.
He can’t do that.	Mate ŋu awɔe nenema o.
And with good reason.	Eye kple susu nyui aɖe.
I'm surprised it's in such good shape.	Ewɔ nuku nam be ele nɔnɔme nyui aɖe me abe esia ene.
Many people do that.	Ame geɖe wɔa nu ma.
And not much if you can.	Eye menye nu geɖe ne àte ŋui o.
I am the one who is now.	Nyee nye ame si li fifia.
Find the water.	Di tsi la.
I can’t live without you.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe wò manɔmee o.
I want that to be shocking.	Medi be ema nawɔ nuku na ame.
I was too honored for that.	Bubu nɔ ŋunye akpa ɖe ema ta.
I had that for four weeks or so.	Ema nɔ asinye kwasiɖa ene alo esi wu nenema.
You’re the one who makes them.	Wòe wɔa wo.

That is the	Emae nye .
Let’s try this together and see what happens.	Mina míate esia kpɔ ɖekae akpɔ nusi adzɔ.

There is only one reality here.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ɖeka koe nye afisia.
It was what he expected.	Enye nusi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na.
Some people don’t do this.	Ame aɖewo mewɔa esia o.

It is very very small.	Ele sue ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
He had no children.	Vi aɖeke menɔ esi o.
If you are like that.	Ne èle nenema.
But he was a good kid.	Gake ɖevi nyui aɖee.
Really really want.	Di ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It couldn’t have happened.	Mate ŋu adzɔ hafi o.
This saved me a lot of time.	Esia na mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
Settle the matter.	Ðe nya la gbɔ.
Other neighboring cities tried the same thing.	Du bubu siwo te ɖe wo ŋu hã te nu ma ke kpɔ.
Think about it a lot.	Bu eŋu kpɔ geɖe.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
I don’t know too much.	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke akpa o.
I don’t believe in that.	Nyemeka ɖe ema dzi o.
What is the right thing to do? 	Nukae wòle be míawɔ?
My jaw wasn’t happy.	Nye aɖu menɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm o.

It will be free here.	Vovo anɔ eme le afisia.
And maybe better.	Eye ɖewohĩ anyo wu.
I'll tell you something.	Magblɔ nya aɖe na wò.
If you were real, I would.	Ne ɖe nènye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
I was very, very good.	Me nyo ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
I can’t look up.	Nyemate ŋu afɔ mo dzi o.
He slapped my face with one firm hand.	Etsɔ asi sesẽ ɖeka ƒo nye mo.
You can try that.	Àte ŋu ate ema kpɔ.
The same thing again.	Nu ma ke ake.
More than enough in fact.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ wu le nyateƒe me.
He couldn’t get out.	Mete ŋu do go o.
Nothing that could have helped me anyway.	Naneke meli si ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye le mɔ sia mɔ nu hafi o.
It could be wrong about anything.	Ate ŋu anye vodada le nusianu ŋu.
I can’t get enough.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
Like I have life and death.	Abe alesi agbe kple ku le asinye ene.

He would be amazing in that job.	Awɔ nuku le dɔ ma me.
He didn’t greet her.	Medo gbe nɛ o.
Look at us now.	Kpɔ mí ɖa azɔ.
Very good news.	Nya nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.

On the other hand, it can be interesting.	Le go bubu me la, ate ŋu adzɔ dzi na ame.
There may be someone else there.	Ate ŋu adzɔ be ame bubu aɖe nanɔ afima.
This probably played a role.	Anɔ eme be esia wɔ akpa aɖe.
It is active, not passive.	Enye nusi wɔa dɔ, ke menye nusi mewɔa naneke o.
Something is wrong here.	Nane gblẽ le afisia.

But it seems unlikely.	Gake edze abe ɖe mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.
Some of these rules are very strict.	Se siawo dometɔ aɖewo sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Be very careful!	Kpɔ nyuie ŋutɔ!
And in a more sophisticated way.	Eye le mɔ si de ŋgɔ wu esia nu.
He is like a child.	Ele abe ɖevi ene.
I really need to work on that.	Ele be mawɔ dɔ tso ema ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You are the one who told us about it.	Wòe nye ame si gblɔ nu tso eŋu na mí.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
Consider the past two years.	Bu ƒe eve siwo va yi ŋu kpɔ.
Nothing hot at all.	Naneke meli si xɔ dzo kura o.
Everybody who is everybody is there.	Ame sia ame si nye ame sia ame la le afima.

And that’s why.	Eye esia tae.
Looks great on all of them.	Edze abe gã aɖe ene le wo katã dzi.
You couldn’t be more wrong.	Màte ŋu awɔ vodada wu ema o.
There are two reasons why this should be so.	Susu eve aɖewo tae wòle be esia nanɔ nenema ɖo.
But there is a good reason.	Gake susu nyui aɖe li si tae.
He didn’t know what to do with it all.	Menya nusi wòawɔ kple wo katã o.
What a characteristic.	Nɔnɔme kae nye si.
I have done more than anyone else would have done.	Mewɔ nu geɖe wu alesi ame bubu aɖeke awɔe.
He was surprised that she was surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ be ewɔ nuku nɛ.
He wasn’t a good person at all.	Menye ame nyui aɖeke kura o.
He’s done this before.	Ewɔ esia kpɔ.
No one is behind us.	Ame aɖeke mele megbe na mí o.
I'm sorry for the.	Meɖe kuku ɖe...
He never did anything bad to me like some people.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke ɖe ŋunye abe ame aɖewo ene kpɔ o.
But nobody does that.	Gake ame aɖeke mewɔa nu ma o.
I think it would have worked.	Mesusu be anye ne awɔ dɔ hafi.
Last year was the past.	Ƒe si va yi nye ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi.
He couldn’t go any further.	Mete ŋu yi ŋgɔ wu ema o.
That would be nice.	Ema anyo na ame.
It must have been a catch.	Anɔ eme be enye nusi lé ame ŋutɔ.
Please tell me what happened.	Taflatse gblɔ nusi dzɔ nam.
This process can take anywhere from a few months to years.	Dɔ sia wɔwɔ ate ŋu axɔ tso ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo va ɖo ƒe geɖe.

There were very few problems, none of them very serious.	Kuxi ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ anyi, wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ vevie ŋutɔ o.
It’s that kind of place.	Enye teƒe ma ƒomevi.
But he won’t do it.	Gake mawɔe o.

It is necessary, of course.	Ehiã ya.
A good name for a city.	Ŋkɔ nyui aɖe na du aɖe.
In fact, it can happen over a long period of time.	Le nyateƒe me la, ate ŋu adzɔ le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe me.
He quickly got hot.	Dzo ge ɖe eme kaba.
Between this and this.	Le esia kple esia dome.
He just made a mistake.	Ðeko wòwɔ vodada.
By his own kind.	To eya ŋutɔ ƒe ƒomevi dzi.
I would have liked to have done that.	Anye ne madi be mawɔe nenema hafi.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
Go to the main house.	Yi aƒe gã la me.
I have something to say.	Nya aɖe le asinye magblɔ.
Or have something in them.	Alo nane nanɔ wo me.
Stop that!	Dzudzɔ ema!
Find a new way.	Di mɔ yeye aɖe.
Keep doing this.	Yi esia wɔwɔ dzi.
He can talk to people more easily.	Ate ŋu aƒo nu na amewo bɔbɔe wu.
There was no one in the market.	Ame aɖeke menɔ asi la me o.

It can work again.	Ate ŋu awɔ dɔ ake.
Things weren’t working for me.	Nuwo menɔ dɔ wɔm nam o.

But the result is clear.	Gake nusi do tso eme la me kɔ ƒã.
A place without time.	Teƒe aɖe si me ɣeyiɣi mele o.
Not for his own.	Menye na eya ŋutɔ tɔ o.

Come back to the scene.	Va trɔ gbɔ.
I don’t really know about it.	Nyemenya nu tso eŋu tututu o.
It is the right thing to do.	Enye nu si sɔ be woawɔ.
However, one always encounters one of the following situations.	Gake ame doa go nɔnɔme siwo gbɔna la dometɔ ɖeka ɣesiaɣi.
A small clear hole lay ahead.	Do sue aɖe si me kɔ la nɔ ŋgɔ.
For many reasons.	Le susu geɖe ta.

You are not going to tell me what to do.	Mèle nusi mawɔ gblɔ ge nam o.
He slammed his leg in anger.	Etsɔ dziku ƒo eƒe afɔ.

And that just might be the point.	Eye ema tututu ate ŋu anye nya la.
But this can go too far.	Gake esia ate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ akpa.

People grew up with us.	Amewo tsi ɖe mía ŋu.
What you don’t have is a personal life.	Nusi mele asiwò o la nye ame ŋutɔ ƒe agbe.
I never felt out of place there.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be nyemele teƒe aɖeke le afima o.
I can do this.	Mate ŋu awɔ esia.
He also had two assists.	Kpekpeɖeŋu eve hã nɔ esi.
I saved two lives.	Meɖe ame eve ɖe agbe.
Everyone laughed.	Amesiame ko nu.
It is very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ.
That doesn’t matter now.	Ema mehiã fifia o.

Everything else is great.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nyo ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t put himself in their place.	Mete ŋu tsɔ eɖokui ɖo wo teƒe o.

Maybe nothing can.	Ðewohĩ naneke mate ŋui o.
He couldn’t do that now.	Mete ŋu wɔ ema fifia o.
Yet nothing is worth it.	Ke hã naneke medze o.
You can’t prove anything.	Màte ŋu aɖo kpe naneke dzi o.
No one really cared at all.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ kura o.
There will be work here.	Dɔ anɔ anyi le afisia.
A few people attended the meeting.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo va kpekpea teƒe.
This is not true at all.	Esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
None of them allowed it.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meɖe mɔ ɖe eŋu o.
There was no money for that.	Ga aɖeke menɔ anyi na ema o.
But he seems to be doing well.	Gake edze abe ele nu wɔm nyuie ene.
But that day never came.	Gake ŋkeke ma meva kpɔ o.
Now, think about it this way.	Azɔ, bu eŋu kpɔ alea.
That is until this year.	Emae nye vaseɖe ƒe sia me.
I don't understand.	Nyemese egɔme o.
There is only one problem.	Kuxi ɖeka koe li.
Something else is wrong or strange.	Nu bubu aɖe hã gblẽ alo wɔ nuku.
I felt something strange.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nane wɔ nuku nam.
Or follow his heart.	Alo wɔ ɖe eƒe dzi dzi.
And it used to be that way.	Eye wònɔ nenema tsã hã.
I can’t pretend to be angry.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ abe ɖe medo dziku ene o.
That’s it for today.	Emae nye esia na egbea.
Food is excellent.	Nuɖuɖu nyo ŋutɔ.
This was very damaging to him.	Esia gblẽ nu nɛ ale gbegbe.
Nothing ever came out of nothing.	Naneke medo tso naneke me kpɔ o.
It had worked well for me.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie nam tsã.
But just look at this thing.	Gake kpɔ nu sia ɖa ko.
He missed our meeting.	Míaƒe kpekpea to eŋu.
And there may be some truth to that.	Eye nyateƒe aɖe ate ŋu anɔ nya ma me.
That it surprised us.	Be ewɔ nuku na mí.
I need to talk to him.	Ele be maƒo nu kplii.
But paradoxes, this might be a better fit.	Gake nya siwo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu la, esia ate ŋu anye nusi sɔ nyuie wu.
You know what you are now.	Ènya nusi nènye fifia.
There is no real reason.	Susu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke meli o.
But it didn’t do much.	Gake mewɔ dɔ boo aɖeke o.
Will go home when the project is done.	Ayi aƒeme ne dɔa wu enu.
He is looking for himself.	Ele eɖokui dim.
He didn’t want me to be there.	Medi be manɔ afima o.
I'm not sure there's anything else.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be nu bubu aɖeke hã li o.
I can’t do it alone.	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔe o.
' have '.	' le esi '.
Amazing.	Wɔ nuku.
That is not an easy thing to do.	Ema menye nu bɔbɔe aɖeke wɔwɔ o.
I don’t want to know anything about them.	Nyemedi be manya naneke tso wo ŋu o.
However, he did more.	Ke hã, ewɔ nu geɖe wu.
I am also sorry to hear of your loss.	Eve nye hã be mese wò nusi bu la.
However, it is not.	Ke hã, mele alea o.
Let me tell you what happened.	Na magblɔ nu si dzɔ la na wò.
I'll be here to meet you.	Mava afisia be mado go wò.
Not that I don’t care.	Menye ɖe metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
There is no one near you.	Ame aɖeke meli si te ɖe ŋuwò o.
It doesn’t work alongside anything else.	Mewɔa dɔ kpe ɖe nu bubu aɖeke ŋu o.
This is by no means a necessity.	Esia menye nusi hiã vevie kura o.
It started out so well.	Edze egɔme nyuie ale gbegbe.
It’s nothing like that.	Menye naneke si le abe ema ene o.
Let’s have a plan.	Mina ɖoɖo aɖe nanɔ mía si.
I hope you can have fun.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ.
No one knew what to do.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi wòawɔ o.
Like his dead old dog.	Abe eƒe avu xoxo kuku ene.
Let’s work on it.	Mina míawɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
It started with a strong wind.	Edze egɔme kple ya sesẽ aɖe.
I remember the car.	Meɖo ŋku ʋua dzi.
He has a job to do.	Dɔ aɖe le esi.
Lost and without strings.	Bu eye ka mele eŋu o.
Mine is quite the opposite.	Nye tɔ ya to vovo kura na ema.
They are all lost.	Wo katã bu.
Not nearly enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ kloe o.
You are missing the point altogether.	Èle nya la tom kura.
It fell very short.	Edze anyi kpuie kura.
You’re the one who isn’t.	Wòe nye ame si menye nenema o.
That’s what’s going on here.	Emae nye nusi le edzi yim le afisia.
I had an idea.	Susu aɖe nɔ asinye.
Nothing will be easy.	Naneke manɔ bɔbɔe o.
Something can happen all at once.	Nane ate ŋu adzɔ zi ɖeka.
Hours later, police arrested him as well.	Le gaƒoƒo aɖewo megbe la, kpovitɔwo lé eya hã.
I want that now.	Medi nenema fifia.
This was a bit short.	Esia nɔ kpuie vie.
I just never felt the need.	Ðeko nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be ehiã o.
You gave this to us.	Wòe tsɔ esia na mí.
Its very simple.	Eƒe nu bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
It was my first night out in a while.	Enye zã gbãtɔ si medo go le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe.
Some of us never do.	Mía dometɔ aɖewo mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
This new home required a lot of work.	Aƒe yeye sia bia dɔ geɖe wɔwɔ.
That way you have two separate projects.	To mɔ sia dzi la, dɔ eve siwo to vovo la anɔ asiwò.
I tried and tried.	Medze agbagba eye medze agbagba hã.
It will work.	Awɔ dɔ.
You might be surprised.	Ðewohĩ awɔ nuku na wò.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
Not that he could.	Menye ɖe wòate ŋui o.
Each of them is a characteristic.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe nye nɔnɔme aɖewo.
I'm sure you can handle them.	Meka ɖe edzi be àte ŋu akpɔ wo gbɔ.
Within an hour or so.	Le gaƒoƒo ɖeka alo esi wu nenema me.
For him, and for me.	Le eya ta, kple na nye hã.
But in a practical way.	Gake le mɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ nu.
It’s probably not possible for you.	Anɔ eme be manya wɔ na wò o.
You can stay as long as you want.	Àte ŋu anɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi si nèdi.
You are very simple.	Èle bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Try something else.	Te nu bubu aɖe kpɔ.
I just don’t know what else to say to that.	Ðeko nyemenya nya bubu si magblɔ na nya ma o.
He will apologize.	Aɖe kuku.
Before that, a teacher.	Do ŋgɔ na ema la, nufiala aɖe.
I found my ear, sort of.	Meke ɖe nye to ŋu, ƒomevi aɖe.
That’s myself.	Ema nye ŋutɔ.
But think about it.	Gake bu eŋu kpɔ.
But it is true.	Gake enye nyateƒe.
I think your car may have broken down.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ wò ʋua gblẽ.
And almost all of them changed my life.	Eye wo katã kloe trɔ nye agbe.
What will happen to my hair.	Nukae adzɔ ɖe nye ɖa dzi.
I need to get out of this room.	Ele be mado le xɔ sia me.
My mouth is money.	Nye nu nye ga.
I can’t do it now.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe fifia o.
You’ve made me.	Wòe wɔm.
There was no normal problem.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ anyi si sɔ o.
Those who have nothing, want something.	Ame siwo si naneke mele o la, di nane.
He couldn't get out of her grip.	Mete ŋu do go le eƒe asi me o.
Everything went smoothly.	Nusianu yi edzi le ɖoɖo nu.
We cannot live without air.	Míate ŋu anɔ anyi ya manɔmee o.
Now he is interested.	Fifia etsɔ ɖe le eme.
Something needs to be done about this.	Ele be woawɔ nane tso esia ŋu.
You have to do that yourself.	Ele be wò ŋutɔ nàwɔ ema.
Let them fight it out among themselves.	Mina woawɔ avu kplii le wo nɔewo dome.
And we know what we have to do.	Eye míenya nu si wòle be míawɔ.
I wanted it to be surprising.	Medi be wòawɔ nuku na ame.
You can also contact us.	Àte ŋu aƒo ka na mí hã.
But you did this to me.	Ke wòe wɔ nu sia ɖe ŋunye.
But there wasn’t much.	Gake nu geɖe menɔ anyi o.
This will be useful in the following cases.	Esia aɖe vi le nya siwo gbɔna me.
Only one person can help.	Ame ɖeka koe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu.
It seemed like a good enough plan to him.	Edze abe ɖoɖo nyui aɖe si sɔ ene nɛ.
I have been there myself.	Nye ŋutɔ hã menɔ afima kpɔ.
It didn’t last long.	Menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
There is no problem there.	Kuxi aɖeke mele afima o.
If only he could prove it.	Ne ɖe wòate ŋu aɖo kpe edzi ko hafi.
This path merges into two parts.	Mɔ sia ƒoa ƒu ɖe akpa eve me.
How long has it been since either.	Ɣeyiɣi didi kae nye ema tso esime wo dometɔ aɖeke.
I am doing this all the time.	Mele esia wɔm ɣesiaɣi.
Was he expecting it?	Ðe wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na?
It wasn’t something he was doing for her.	Menye nane si wɔm wònɔ nɛ o.
Everything else is gone.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nu yi.
Maybe he knows something.	Ðewohĩ anya nane.
I had never heard of them.	Nyemese wo ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
I couldn’t swallow.	Nyemete ŋu mi o.
I was very happy with it.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ɖe eŋu.
He was always such a good kid.	Enye ɖevi nyui aɖe alea gbegbe ɣesiaɣi.
It is so easy that you can do it now.	Ele bɔbɔe ale gbegbe be àte ŋu awɔe fifia.
No one else came through.	Ame bubu aɖeke meva to eme o.
It doesn’t seem to though.	Edze abe mewɔa esia o gake.
He lost his mind.	Eƒe susu bu.
We are not home at all.	Míenye aƒe kura o.
There are two reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo li siwo tae wòle nenema ɖo.
But there are two things about that.	Gake nu eve aɖewo le ema ŋu.
He looked tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ene.
A dog bit my leg.	Avu aɖe ɖu nye afɔ.
Maybe there was more to it than that.	Ðewohĩ nu geɖe nɔ eme wu ema.
In a couple of ways.	Le mɔ eve aɖewo nu.
Let me know what you think.	Na manya nusi nèsusu.
We’re all going through the same thing, really.	Mí katã míele nu ɖeka ma ke me tom, le nyateƒe me.
Much, much, much more.	Geɖe, geɖe, geɖe wu.
I would really like that.	Madi nenema ŋutɔ.
But that is impossible.	Gake ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
In a word, he had heart.	Le nya ɖeka me la, dzi nɔ esi.
This city is famous for many things.	Du sia xɔ ŋkɔ le nu geɖe ta.
It will take a lot of time.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
First name at last.	Ŋkɔ gbãtɔ mlɔeba.
A nice inexpensive car.	Ʋu nyui aɖe si mexɔ asi o.
But you are different.	Gake wò ya to vovo.
He seemed to enjoy it.	Edze abe edzɔ dzi nɛ ene.
We all have to work together.	Ele be mí katã míawɔ dɔ ɖekae.
But everything seems very normal.	Gake edze abe nusianu le ɖoɖo nu ŋutɔ ene.
In the same market.	Le asi ma ke me.
I can’t explain everything at once.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nusianu me zi ɖeka o.
The issue is very difficult.	Nya la sesẽ ŋutɔ.
But he couldn't let go now.	Gake mete ŋu ɖe asi le eŋu fifia o.
He is not one of us.	Menye mía dometɔ ɖekae wònye o.
The opposite of everything that exists in some way.	Nusianu si li la ƒe nusi tsi tre ɖe eŋu le mɔ aɖe nu.
It didn’t take long for me either.	Nye hã mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi o.
Time has come for all of us.	Ɣeyiɣi de na mí katã.
I would have been very pleased.	Anye ne edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I did something you didn’t want.	Mewɔ nane si mèdi o.
I need to know who did this.	Ele be manya amesi wɔ esia.
He can fight.	Ate ŋu awɔ avu.
I had food and water.	Nuɖuɖu kple tsi nɔ asinye.
I really enjoyed the work.	Dɔa do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
I am having my first fight.	Mele nye avu gbãtɔ wɔm.
Look, it’s like this.	Kpɔ ɖa, ele alea.
It was almost impossible for me to concentrate.	Manya wɔ kloe be nye susu nanɔ nu ŋu o.
In the car, too.	Le ʋua hã me.
Be balanced in your diet.	Da sɔ le wò nuɖuɖu me.
What is so weird about that???.	Nukae nye nusi wɔ nuku le ema ŋu???.
It will never come cheap.	Menye nusi mexɔ asi o ava gbeɖe o.
We don’t know exactly where we are.	Míenya afisi tututu míele o.
We don’t know what to do.	Míenya nusi míawɔ o.
He's not eating much.	Menye nu geɖe ɖum wòle o.
We are very much on board.	Míele ʋua me ŋutɔ.
And maybe he used to be.	Eye ɖewohĩ eya hã nɔ nenema tsã.
I can’t pray anymore.	Nyemate ŋu ado gbe ɖa azɔ o.
But it’s just one of many that have passed over the past two months.	Gake geɖe siwo va yi le ɣleti eve siwo va yi me la dometɔ ɖeka koe wònye.
If you don't know.	Ne mènya o la.
Or a man.	Alo ŋutsu aɖe.
This day was going well.	Ŋkeke sia nɔ edzi yim nyuie.
It’s just that way.	Ðeko wòle nenema.
Some things are necessary.	Nu aɖewo hiã.
These things are very expensive.	Nu siawo xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
This is a very interesting book.	Esia nye agbalẽ si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
This is a very good job.	Esia nye dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t relax.	Mete ŋu ɖe dzi ɖi o.
It’s not you.	Menye wòe o.
He wasn’t ready for that.	Menɔ klalo na ema o.
Bookings are required in advance.	Ele be woawɔ agbalẽ do ŋgɔ.
We are not doing this now.	Míele esia wɔm fifia o.
And.	Kple.
Same thing in another way.	Nu ma ke le mɔ bubu nu.
About the same year.	Anɔ abe ƒe ɖeka ma ke ene.
That didn’t cost anything.	Ema mexɔ naneke o.
Always.	Ɣesiaɣi.
Things are good.	Nuwo nyo.
Like today.	Abe egbea ene.
Everyone was happy.	Amesiame kpɔ dzidzɔ.
My own name.	Nye ŋutɔ nye ŋkɔ.
Nothing new here.	Nu yeye aɖeke mele afisia o.
But he didn’t let go.	Gake meɖe asi le eŋu o.
And no one really wants that.	Eye ame aɖeke medi nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Come up with a great idea or be one-sided.	Va kple susu gã aɖe alo nye akpa ɖeka.
There’s something here that I’ve never seen before.	Nu aɖe le afisia si mekpɔ kpɔ o.
I heard so much.	Mese nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
Perhaps this is true.	Ðewohĩ nya sia nye nyateƒe.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
That’s some bad things that can happen.	Ema nye nu gbegblẽ aɖewo siwo ate ŋu adzɔ.
That’s a lot of hard work.	Ema nye dɔ sesẽ geɖe ŋutɔ.
But, in short, it didn’t work.	Gake, le kpuie ko la, mewɔ dɔ o.
The following procedure shall be followed in this case.	Woawɔ ɖe ɖoɖo si gbɔna dzi le nɔnɔme sia me.
Two men entered.	Ŋutsu eve ge ɖe eme.
This, however, is of little importance.	Gake esia ya mele vevie boo o.
He has nothing and isn’t really working towards anything.	Naneke mele esi o eye mele dɔ wɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ ɖe naneke ŋu o.
It didn’t work for any of us.	Mewɔ dɔ na mía dometɔ aɖeke o.
I want to know how he got away with it.	Medi be manya ale si wòwɔ si le eme.
These things are essential to our survival.	Nu siawo le vevie ŋutɔ hafi míate ŋu anɔ agbe.
That’s just one thing.	Nu ɖeka koe nye ema.
The night came.	Zã va ɖo.
Again, this may be my last chance to speak.	Le afisia hã la, esia ate ŋu anye mɔnukpɔkpɔ mamlɛtɔ nam be maƒo nu.
That’s just not the case here.	Ðeko mele alea le afisia o.
Please let me know about this.	Taflatse na manya nu tso nya sia ŋu.
He couldn’t do anything with it.	Mete ŋu wɔ naneke kplii o.
There’s nothing like a good book.	Naneke meli si le abe agbalẽ nyui ene o.
This is here, and there and there.	Esia le afisia, kple afima kple afima.
They seem to be enjoying themselves.	Edze abe wole dzidzɔ kpɔm ene.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe li siwo tae wòle nenema ɖo.
Within this, there was one exception.	Le esia me la, ɖeka aɖe hã nɔ anyi si to vovo.
It started out briefly.	Edze egɔme kpuie.
But that was good enough.	Gake ema nyo ale gbegbe.
I wanted so much at once.	Medi nu geɖe ŋutɔ zi ɖeka.
This building is different.	Xɔ sia ƒe nɔnɔme to vovo.
You are a busy man.	Ènye ŋutsu si ŋu vovo mele o.
Everything went well until morning.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie vaseɖe ŋdi.
But it hasn’t arrived yet.	Gake meva ɖo haɖe o.
You have to do something about that.	Ele be nàwɔ nane tso ema ŋu.
Water, water and more water!	Tsi, tsi kple tsi geɖe wu!
This is enough for him.	Esia sɔ gbɔ nɛ.
The project involved a lot of paperwork.	Dɔa bia agbalẽ geɖe wɔwɔ.
He is on his way now.	Ele mɔ dzi fifia.
Time is precious.	Ɣeyiɣi xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
He always had a police trail.	Kpovitɔwo ƒe mɔ nɔa eŋu ɣesiaɣi.
Happy people food.	Amewo ƒe nuɖuɖu si me dzidzɔ le.
I understand that was probably making more money.	Mese egɔme be ɖewohĩ ema nɔ ga geɖe wu wɔm.
A month, maybe.	Ɣleti ɖeka, ɖewohĩ.
Thousands of people alive on me.	Ame akpe geɖe siwo le agbe le dzinye.
He can make up many words, but he cannot remember them all now.	Ate ŋu awɔ nya geɖe, gake mate ŋu aɖo ŋku wo katã dzi fifia o.
It was an old gun.	Enye tu xoxo aɖe.
Touch it with him.	Ka asi eŋu kplii.
This last thing.	Nu mamlɛtɔ sia.
He was never going to let me live like that.	Mele mɔ ɖe ge gbeɖe be manɔ agbe nenema gbegbe o.
In fact, in some cases.	Le nyateƒe me la, le go aɖewo me.
But of course it will.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, awɔe nenema.
We can get things done quickly.	Míate ŋu awɔ nuwo kaba.
I had no idea what he was doing.	Nyemenya nusi wɔm wònɔ o.
And the year before, too.	Eye ƒe si do ŋgɔ hã.
I just wouldn’t have known.	Ðeko nyemenya o hafi.
He didn’t get close to it.	Mete ɖe eŋu o.
What you want is there.	Nusi nèdi la le afima.
The actual result was the opposite.	Nusi do tso eme ŋutɔŋutɔ la to vovo na ema.
I don’t know if it’s true or not.	Nyemenya nenye be enye nyateƒe alo menye nyateƒe o.
The reasons for this.	Susu siwo tae wòle alea ɖo.
It is not enough that .	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ be .
But it was definitely impressive.	Gake ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi godoo.
The only downside is that he won’t talk.	Nusi gblẽ le eŋu koe nye be maƒo nu o.
And he, too, started a little.	Eye eya hã, dze egɔme vie.
Now that’s gone.	Fifia ema nu yi.
It will do very well.	Awɔe nyuie ŋutɔ.
This is not true at all.	Esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
That will be so for two reasons.	Anɔ nenema le susu eve aɖewo ta.
But I understand that.	Gake mese nya ma gɔme.
But everyone has an idea.	Gake susu aɖe le amesiame si.
I'm on the road.	Mele mɔ dzi.
I don’t want to do it.	Nyemedi be mawɔe o.
A very great job.	Dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I will be getting into that annual pattern myself soon.	Nye ŋutɔ mava ge ɖe ƒe sia ƒe ƒe nɔnɔme ma me kpuie.
But the car didn’t come.	Gake ʋua meva o.
It is impossible at all.	Manya wɔ kura o.
I just did it.	Ðeko mewɔe.
He didn’t understand.	Mese egɔme o.
Go back to work.	Trɔ yi dɔme.
A lot of work but worth it.	Dɔ geɖe gake edze.
He made a deadly mistake.	Ewɔ vodada ku.
We will do everything for you.	Míawɔ nusianu na wò.
You don’t have to do anything.	Mele be nàwɔ naneke o.
I can see them now.	Mete ŋu kpɔa wo fifia.
It would have been so much easier.	Anye ne anɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ nenema gbegbe hafi.
He put his own on it.	Etsɔ eya ŋutɔ tɔ ɖo edzi.
I was just exhausted.	Ðeko ɖeɖi te ŋunye.
Somewhere, sometime there.	Le afi aɖe, ɣeyiɣi aɖe le afima.
It’s just, something about it.	Ðeko wòle, nane tso eŋu.
He was never sure.	Meka ɖe edzi gbeɖe o.
But he didn't seem too worried.	Gake edze abe metsi dzi ɖe eŋu akpa o ene.
I can’t accept this.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ esia o.
There is, of course, a problem in implementing this policy.	Kuxi aɖe le ɖoɖo sia dzi wɔwɔ me ya.
I understand what you are going through.	Mese nusi me tom nèle gɔme.
There is no one else here.	Ame bubu aɖeke mele afisia o.
Take the lead.	Xɔ ŋgɔ.
I’ve never seen anyone like this.	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke abe esia ene kpɔ o.
I am new to this.	Menye ame yeye le esia me.
One foot.	Afɔ ɖeka.
Inside, everything is one big room.	Le eme la, nusianu nye xɔ gã ɖeka.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
I can’t see what’s wrong there.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi gblẽ le afima o.
It’s for your own sake.	Wò ŋutɔ tae.
Please think about the matter for a moment.	Taflatse bu nya la ŋu vie.
Leave room for him.	Gblẽ teƒe ɖi nɛ.
Please raise your hand.	Meɖe kuku, do asi ɖe dzi.
People were so grateful.	Amewo da akpe ale gbegbe.
He couldn’t tell when he was happy and when he wasn’t.	Mete ŋu nya ɣeyiɣi si me wòle dzidzɔ kpɔm kple ɣeyiɣi si me mele dzidzɔ kpɔm o.
These buildings have seen better days.	Xɔ siawo kpɔ ŋkeke siwo nyo wu.
It doesn’t work.	Mewɔa dɔ o.
He might not know himself, after all.	Ðewohĩ manya eɖokui o, le nyateƒe me.
And that can’t happen.	Eye ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
As a result, prices rose.	Esia wɔe be nuwo ƒe asi yi dzi.
You can stay in my house.	Àte ŋu anɔ nye aƒe me.
You are my rock.	Wòe nye nye kpe.
This is no small thing for me.	Esia menye nu sue aɖe nam o.
He couldn't remember who it belonged to.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku amesi tɔ wònye dzi o.
It hurts just as much.	Eve ame nenema ke.
A really nice guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Like this morning.	Abe ŋdi sia ene.
He didn’t want anything.	Medi naneke o.
It was my first real job, you know.	Enye nye dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ gbãtɔ, ènya.
Let us keep our minds fixed on it.	Na míaƒe susu nanɔ eme.
But we obviously knew it was coming.	Gake edze ƒã be míenya be gbɔna.
This is more than that.	Esia nye nusi wu ema.
I got an idea.	Mekpɔ susu aɖe.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
No one will come near you.	Ame aɖeke mate ɖe ŋuwò o.
It is a passionate desire.	Enye didi vevie.
Two types of situations are possible.	Nɔnɔme ƒomevi eve ate ŋu adzɔ.
Not very well.	Menye nyuie ŋutɔ o.
But it didn’t seem to work.	Gake edze abe mewɔ dɔ o ene.
I want to say the opposite.	Medi be magblɔ nya si tsi tre ɖe eŋu.

There was nothing for me to see.	Naneke menɔ anyi nam be makpɔ o.
Take a closer look.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie.

Just a few original ones.	Gbãtɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
I can explain it.	Mate ŋu aɖe eme.
He doesn’t always do this.	Mewɔa esia ɣesiaɣi o.
I never had a job of my own.	Nye ŋutɔ nye dɔ aɖeke menɔ asinye kpɔ o.
His previous maximum chance was two thousand.	Eƒe mɔnukpɔkpɔ si sɔ gbɔ wu tsã enye akpe eve.

He couldn’t find them.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe wo ŋu o.
They will do what they like.	Woawɔ nusi dze wo ŋu.
I wonder if this book will work for me.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe agbalẽ sia awɔ dɔ nam hã.
I can go there.	Mate ŋu ayi afima.
Live with them.	Nɔ agbe kpli wo.
This was not what he expected at all.	Esia menye nusi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na kura o.
Everything here is just amazing.	Nusianu si le afisia wɔ nuku ko.
Water is necessary for life.	Tsi hiã na agbe.
Mine is broken.	Nye tɔ gblẽ.
You are not waiting for me.	Menye nyee nèle lalam o.
No sense of anything else.	Susu aɖeke mele nu bubu aɖeke ŋu o.
And .	Kple .
In fact, he was very satisfied.	Le nyateƒe me la, eƒe dzi dze eme ŋutɔ.
But he didn’t know them.	Gake menya wo o.
But this is different.	Gake esia to vovo.
I was much more focused on my work.	Nye susu nɔ nye dɔa ŋu wu kura.
It didn’t help much.	Meɖe vi boo aɖeke o.
The result, in this case, would be normal.	Nusi ado tso eme, le go sia me la, anye nusi sɔ.
And to ma is me.	Le go ma ke me.
I was a little nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe vie.
Another disappeared, almost overnight.	Bubu bu, le zã ɖeka kloe me.
This is a new day.	Esia nye ŋkeke yeye.
It is much more than that.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema kura.
Mine didn’t do that.	Nye tɔ mewɔe nenema o.
I’m not really sure.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Someone else can beat us to it.	Ame bubu aɖe ate ŋu aƒo mí ɖe eŋu.
Come out with a clear attitude.	Do go kple nɔnɔme si me kɔ.
Or used to be.	Alo nɔ anyi tsã.
We have to work on them.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ tso wo ŋu.
That surprised me a lot.	Ema wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
Some people are different.	Ame aɖewo to vovo.
In almost every case.	Le go ɖesiaɖe kloe me.
There is a loud voice.	Gbe sesẽ le afima.
We can do better.	Míate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu.
I like that challenge.	Kuxi ma dzɔa dzi nam.
Still, it is a possibility.	Ke hã, enye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ.
Everything is still there for that moment.	Nusianu gakpɔtɔ li na ɣeyiɣi ma.
Yet he doesn’t.	Ke hã mewɔa esia o.
I’m so glad to see you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mekpɔ wò.
It could be a mistake.	Ate ŋu anye vodada.
Stay away from them strongly.	Te ɖa le wo ŋu vevie.
You just can’t do it.	Ðeko màte ŋui o.
There was no one in the market at all.	Ame aɖeke menɔ asi la me kura o.
I couldn’t see his face.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ eƒe mo o.
Something is wrong.	Nane gblẽ.
I got his money.	Mexɔ eƒe ga.
I would be very grateful for any help.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ɖe kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe ta.
That’s a good news.	Nya nyuie wònye.
Last week, this thing would unseat someone.	Kwasiɖa si va yi me la, nu sia aɖe ame le zi dzi.
The man who was speaking donated money.	Ŋutsu si nɔ nu ƒom la dzɔ ga.
Two people each.	Ame eve ɖesiaɖe.
He seemed like a nice guy.	Edze abe ŋutsu nyui aɖee wònye ene.
I think it’s a great idea.	Mesusu be enye susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
As if there was anger in him.	Abe ɖe dziku le eme ene.
This is obviously wrong.	Esia nye nu gbegblẽ si dze ƒã.
Be much more, much more.	Nye geɖe wu, geɖe wu.
He couldn’t talk to me.	Mete ŋu ƒo nu nam o.
Ask questions about them.	Bia nya tso wo ŋu.
Fresh air is good for you.	Ya nyui nyo na wò.
I am not the person they are looking for.	Menye ame si dim wole ye menye o.
But it is not at all.	Gake menye nenema kura o.
I really liked what he did.	Nusi wòwɔ la dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
It couldn’t be easier!.	Mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe wu ema o!.
Now you can see everything.	Fifia àte ŋu akpɔ nusianu.
I wish he were here.	Ne ɖe wòle afisia la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
It’s just something that needs to be done.	Nusi wòle be woawɔ koe wònye.
I think a lot of people can.	Mesusu be ame geɖe ate ŋui.
I have to keep going.	Ele nam be mayi edzi.
It was like nothing I had ever heard before.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe naneke mese kpɔ o ene.
He must act quickly.	Ele be wòawɔ nu kaba.
I just said that.	Ðeko megblɔ be.
Everyone was busy.	Amesiame nɔ dɔ dzi vevie.
He gave the word.	Etsɔ nya la na.
There is truth in this.	Nyateƒe le nya sia me.
He could not continue his work.	Mete ŋu yi eƒe dɔa dzi o.
I want to at least try.	Medi be mate kpɔ ya teti.
That’s close to it.	Ema te ɖe eŋu.
I think you’re really onto something here.	Mesusu be èle nane dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ le afisia.
There was no man there who came.	Ŋutsu aɖeke menɔ anyi le afima si va o.
Say what you have to say.	Gblɔ nya si wòle be nàgblɔ.
Not before, and not now.	Menye do ŋgɔ o, eye menye fifia hã o.
I know everything about it.	Menya nusianu tso eŋu.
And people get upset about this.	Eye amewo doa dziku ɖe nya sia ŋu.
It’s been almost a month, now.	Ɣleti ɖeka kloe enye sia, fifia.
I was going to say the same thing.	Nye hã menɔ nya ma ke gblɔ ge.
Only for several years.	Ƒe geɖe koe.
I don’t know what it is.	Nyemenya nusi wònye o.

I have a plan for you and me.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo aɖe na mía kple wò.
But it will take its time.	Gake axɔ eƒe ɣeyiɣi.
But this is obviously not possible.	Gake edze ƒã be esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
We have known each other for a long time.	Míenya mía nɔewo ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
Everything comes with a reason.	Nusianu va kple susu aɖe.
I can do this job easily.	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ sia bɔbɔe.
No other words are necessary.	Nya bubu aɖeke mehiã o.
He cannot escape this.	Mate ŋu asi le esia nu o.
I really have to work on that.	Ele nam ŋutɔŋutɔ be mawɔ dɔ tso ema ŋu.
I want to meet you.	Medi be mado go.
He should have had a thousand, easily, last year.	Ðe wòle be akpe ɖeka nanɔ esi, bɔbɔe, le ƒe si va yi me hafi.
In fact, he didn’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
He could not attend the meeting.	Mete ŋu de kpekpea o.
I don’t know where it could have gone.	Nyemenya afi si wòate ŋu ayi hafi o.
Please help me with this.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye le esia me.
But remember, we don’t have much time.	Gake ɖo ŋku edzi be ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele mía si o.
You are too small.	Èle sue akpa.
I can’t stand this.	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi le esia nu o.
Only his head was in the room.	Eƒe ta koe nɔ xɔa me.
He was obsessed with his work.	Eƒe dɔa xɔ susu me nɛ.
But he can’t do it.	Gake mate ŋui o.
We must act now.	Ele be míawɔ nu fifia.
Thanks to everyone who contributed.	Akpe na amesiame si kpe asi ɖe eŋu.
That’s a little difficult.	Ema sesẽ vie.
Some new ones, too.	Yeye aɖewo hã.
And yet, there had never been a man.	Eye ke hã, ŋutsu aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
That’s really the issue here.	Emae nye nya si le afisia ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s a small moment.	Enye ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe.
He barely worked on the one.	Ƒã hafi wòwɔ dɔ le ɖeka la ŋu.
This does not exist, and may never exist.	Esia meli o, eye ɖewohĩ manɔ anyi gbeɖe o.
None of us did that.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
I know this very well.	Menya esia nyuie.
This may be surprising.	Ðewohĩ esia awɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I am not sure of anything else.	Nyemeka ɖe nu bubu aɖeke dzi o.
But there was one problem.	Gake kuxi ɖeka aɖe nɔ anyi.
Often at the same time.	Zi geɖe la, le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka ma ke me.
You might say that.	Àte ŋu agblɔ be.
It was too soon though.	Enye kaba akpa ke hã.
They had no children.	Vi aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
And it was just as well, too.	Eye nenema ke wònɔ nyuie, hã.
No one could turn around.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu trɔ ɖe eŋu o.
I have some money.	Ga aɖe le asinye.
Let him do his job.	Na wòawɔ eƒe dɔ.
It took up no space in the house.	Mexɔ teƒe aɖeke le aƒea me o.
This is a personal one.	Esia nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
Everything is very different from there.	Nusianu to vovo kura tso afima gbɔ.
It’s a mental issue.	Enye susu me nya aɖe.
It never made sense.	Susu menɔ eme kpɔ o.
I don’t want his money.	Nyemedi eƒe ga o.
It’s not just my loss.	Menye nye nusi bu la koe o.
Also about time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ŋu hã.
Usually.	Zi geɖe.
I was eating there at least that long.	Menɔ nu ɖum le afima ɣeyiɣi didi nenema ya teti.
But I’d rather go.	Gake anyo nam be mayi.
People will take care of everything.	Amewo akpɔ nusianu gbɔ.
We can go anywhere .	Míate ŋu ayi afi sia afi .
It seems to be working for us.	Edze abe ele dɔ wɔm na mí ene.
Here one faces the first problem.	Le afisia la, ame dze ŋgɔ kuxi gbãtɔ.
I would like the same thing.	Nye hã madi nu ma ke.
However, this does not represent a major problem.	Gake esia metsi tre ɖi na kuxi gã aɖeke o.
He didn’t find any.	Mekpɔ ɖeke o.
You can help me more.	Àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye geɖe wu.
It’s not possible.	Manya wɔ o.
They just missed our work.	Ðeko míaƒe dɔa to wo ŋu.
I said that.	Megblɔ nya ma.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I know who this is.	Menya amesi nye esia.
Just like yesterday.	Abe alesi wònɔ le etsɔ me ene.
But he had no idea beyond that.	Gake susu aɖeke menɔ esi wu ema o.
He didn’t see anything.	Mekpɔ naneke o.
The summer is here.	Dzomeŋɔli ɖo.
Stay in this, you.	Nɔ esia me, wò.
Not for anything else.	Menye ɖe naneke ta o.
Close but not last.	Te ɖe eŋu gake menye mamlɛtɔ o.
No one knows anything.	Ame aɖeke menya naneke o.
He was alone in the house with her.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ aƒea me kplii.
This time is different.	Ɣeyiɣi sia to vovo.
Yet this will always be the case.	Ke hã esia anɔ alea ɣesiaɣi.
But he didn’t fall.	Gake medze anyi o.
That is the whole truth.	Emae nye nyateƒe bliboa.
This cannot continue.	Esia mate ŋu ayi edzi o.
That was very difficult for me.	Ema sesẽ nam ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t feel anything.	Nyemete ŋu se naneke le ɖokuinye me o.
In this room.	Le xɔ sia me.
I worked on the opposite side.	Mewɔ dɔ le akpa si tsi tre ɖe eŋu la dzi.
Before the surgery.	Hafi woawɔ dɔ nɛ.
But that can’t be the case.	Gake ema mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
One more thing I don’t understand.	Nu ɖeka bubu si gɔme mese o.
You can finish the last part today.	Àte ŋu awu akpa mamlɛtɔ nu egbea.
I'm sure it will be in a day or two.	Meka ɖe edzi be anye le ŋkeke ɖeka alo eve me.
I have never wanted anyone more.	Nyemedi ame aɖeke wu ema kpɔ o.
A state of affairs.	Nɔnɔme si me nɔnɔme aɖeke mele o.
I could stay there for years.	Mate ŋu anɔ afima ƒe geɖe.
I can go alone.	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu ayi.
That has been around.	Ema nɔ anyi kpɔ.
It was almost noon now.	Ŋdɔ me kloe fifia.
But one thing seems likely.	Gake edze abe nu ɖeka aɖe ate ŋu adzɔ ene.
If you are trying.	Ne èle agbagba dzem.
There can only be one thing.	Nu ɖeka koe ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
This is a fact.	Esia nye nyateƒe.
Get out of it.	Do go le eme.
I wasn’t too busy.	Vovo menɔ ŋunye akpa o.
Talk to him about it.	Ƒo nu kplii.
I ask for help.	Mebiaa kpekpeɖeŋu.
If you have to say something twice, use the same word.	Ne ele be nàgblɔ nya aɖe zi eve la, ke zã nya ɖeka ma ke.
Many people are concerned about this.	Ame geɖe tsi dzi ɖe nya sia ŋu.
I couldn’t see.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nu o.
So far, no one has been able to.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ame aɖeke mate ŋui o.
At least one thing went well.	Nu ɖeka ya teti va yi nyuie.
Find out what job you want.	Kpɔ dɔ si nèdi la ɖa.
Also, he only has one eye.	Azɔ hã, ŋku ɖeka koe le esi.
There were two people on duty, many of whom may have been in opposition to each other.	Ame eve nɔ dɔ dzi, eye ɖewohĩ wo dometɔ geɖe tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
In the end, common sense prevailed.	Mlɔeba la, susu nyui ɖu dzi.
You can’t tell what’s on their mind.	Màte ŋu agblɔ nusi le susu me na wo o.
His name is also a lie.	Eƒe ŋkɔ hã nye alakpa.
If you have anything to say to me, come and see me in person.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò nàgblɔ nam la, wò ŋutɔ va kpɔm.
There is none of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
I just worked.	Ðeko mewɔ dɔ.
Quite the opposite in this case.	Nusi to vovo kura na esia le go sia me.
This sounds simple, but there are issues.	Esia ɖi nu bɔbɔe aɖe, gake nya aɖewo le eme.
There are no talking books.	Agbalẽ siwo ƒoa nu meli o.
But after a while, you can get over it.	Gake le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe la, àte ŋu aɖu edzi.
A kind of character.	Nɔnɔme ƒomevi aɖe.
He never quite knew why.	Menya nusita tututu gbeɖe o.
I was usually alone.	Zi geɖe la, nye ɖeka koe nɔa anyi.
I was worried.	Metsi dzi.
It didn’t surprise him.	Mewɔ nuku nɛ o.
I can’t stand that guy.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe ŋutsu ma nu o.
Add more water, if needed.	Tsɔ tsi bubu kpe ɖe eŋu, ne ehiã.
I don’t think it will actually go.	Nyemesusu be ayi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I'm sure there's nothing there.	Meka ɖe edzi be naneke mele afima o.
Through his blood.	To eƒe ʋu me.
I did a simple job.	Mewɔ dɔ bɔbɔe aɖe.
I just had to do it.	Ðeko wòle be mawɔe.
It is much more than that.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema kura.
So far everything seems fine.	Vaseɖe fifia la, edze abe nusianu nyo ene.
I want to do that.	Medi be mawɔe nenema.
Nothing major, nothing major.	Naneke gã aɖeke meli o, nu gã aɖeke meli o.
The house is small.	Aƒea le sue.
Too much didn’t make sense.	Susu menɔ nu geɖe akpa ŋu o.
Here’s mine.	Nye tɔ enye si.
There will be plenty of work for them.	Dɔ geɖe anɔ anyi na wo.
Or not, but he will definitely try.	Alo menye nenema o, gake ate kpɔ godoo.
He is very passionate about his work.	Dzo le eme ŋutɔ ɖe eƒe dɔa ŋu.
He can’t do anything.	Mate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
His heart was warm.	Eƒe dzi xɔ dzo.
I need water.	Mehiã tsi.
I’ve always borrowed one from someone else.	Mexɔ ɖeka le ame bubu si ɣesiaɣi.
But it looks like someone is already in her room.	Gake edze abe ame aɖe le eƒe xɔ me xoxo ene.
Actually for reality for reality.	Le nyateƒe me na nu ŋutɔŋutɔ na nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It seems so simple.	Edze abe nu le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ ene.
But it actually happened.	Gake edzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I couldn’t get you out of my head.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe wò le nye ta me o.
This is a bit of a time-consuming process.	Esia nye dɔ si xɔa ɣeyiɣi geɖe vie.
He could not have been there.	Mate ŋu anɔ afima hafi o.
Not just because it’s quick.	Menye esi wònye kaba ta koe o.
Maybe, maybe more.	Ðewohĩ, ɖewohĩ geɖe wu.
And about that, too.	Eye le ema ŋu hã.
But there is a point to this.	Gake nya aɖe le esia ŋu.
Let me tell you about it .	Mina magblɔ eŋu nya na mi .
I really needed to talk to him.	Ehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ be maƒo nu kplii.
But we have a lot of time together.	Gake ɣeyiɣi geɖe le mía si ɖekae.
He is here with us.	Ele mía gbɔ le afisia.
I asked for help.	Mebia kpekpeɖeŋu.
I'm already in control.	Megale ɖokuinye dzi ɖum xoxo.
So can you, too.	Nenema ke wò hã àte ŋui.
This is certainly true.	Esia nye nyateƒe godoo.
There is hardly anyone else in this town now.	Ƒã hafi ame bubu aɖeke mele du sia me fifia o.
I want to know who did it.	Medi be manya amesi wɔe.
Sit right down.	Nɔ anyi tututu.
He would have liked this.	Anye ne esia adzɔ dzi nɛ hafi.
It's amazing,	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, .
It was a long time ago.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si va yi.
I said the exact opposite.	Megblɔ nya si tsi tre ɖe eŋu tututu.
They should be surprised.	Ele be wòawɔ nuku na wo.

Everybody knows everybody.	Ame sia ame nya ame sia ame.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I feel strongly now.	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie fifia.
Things are very difficult.	Nuwo sesẽ ŋutɔ.
It seems to be working fine now.	Edze abe ele dɔ wɔm nyuie fifia ene.
But again, that will take time.	Gake le afisia hã la, ema axɔ ɣeyiɣi.
And nobody did anything about it.	Eye ame aɖeke mewɔ naneke tso eŋu o.
Few people are interested.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe tsɔ ɖe le eme.
Things are not like that anymore.	Nuwo megale nenema o.
Make time for it.	Di ɣeyiɣi ɖe eŋu.
We can’t have one without you.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ɖeka wò manɔmee o.
But everyone decided to keep going.	Gake amesiame ɖoe be yeayi edzi.
Try this book.	Te agbalẽ sia kpɔ.
That’s a good news.	Nya nyui aɖee.
All the same, he couldn't.	Wo katã wole nenema la, mete ŋui o.
All of you.	Mi katã.
Forget the blood, the bone in his hand.	Ŋlɔ ʋu, ƒu si le eƒe asi me la be.
It is definitely there.	Ele afima godoo.
It will raise an error otherwise.	Afɔ vodada aɖe ɖe te ne menye nenema o.
You can stay.	Àte ŋu anɔ anyi.
So far, nothing.	Vaseɖe fifia la, naneke meli o.
No one greeted him.	Ame aɖeke medo gbe nɛ o.
That project will end tomorrow afternoon.	Dɔ ma awu enu etsɔ ŋdɔ.
So let’s hurry up.	Eya ta mina míawɔ kaba.
He will, of course.	Awɔe ya.
He put his hand over his heart.	Etsɔ eƒe asi da ɖe eƒe dzi dzi.
Same problem here.	Kuxi ma ke le afisia hã.
It is a state of being.	Enye nɔnɔme si me ame le.
But tonight he had to do something different.	Gake le zã sia me la, ele be wòawɔ nusi to vovo.
This requires more work than what has happened so far.	Esia bia dɔ geɖe wu nusi dzɔ vaseɖe fifia.
It was a pleasure to me.	Enye dzidzɔ nam.
Including my own.	Nye ŋutɔ tɔ hã le eme.
Give him where we are.	Na afi si míele la nɛ.
And of course, this is a valid point.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, esia nye nya si sɔ.
Imagine my surprise.	Bu ale si gbegbe wòwɔ nuku nam la ŋu kpɔ.
Check out where they are.	Kpɔ afisi wole ɖa.
No one was too happy.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ dzidzɔ akpa o.
I wondered if he was one of them.	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe wònye wo dometɔ ɖeka hã.
I want to support him in the good work he is doing.	Medi be mado megbe nɛ le dɔ nyui si wɔm wòle la me.
Maybe tomorrow it will come.	Ðewohĩ etsɔ la, ava.
Something completely different.	Nane si to vovo kura.
But I was fine.	Gake menɔ nyuie.
He has some realities.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖewo le esi.
It was a huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖee.
That’s a pretty good idea.	Ema nye susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Click here for the answer.	Te ɖe afisia ŋu.
He himself has a sense of humor.	Eya ŋutɔ hã ƒe susu nɔa nu ŋu.
Or at least quite a few.	Alo ame ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ ya teti.
Which is the truth.	Nusi nye nyateƒe.

And this should be easy.	Eye ele be esia nanɔ bɔbɔe.
Or for whatever else comes to mind.	Alo le nu bubu ɖesiaɖe si va susu me nam ta.

The job requires a lot of skill.	Dɔa bia aɖaŋu geɖe.

This is really hard.	Esia sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
However, there are some problems.	Ke hã, kuxi aɖewo li.
No one got the job.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ dɔa o.
His face was one of reason.	Eƒe mo nye esi me susu le.
He cannot walk in them.	Mate ŋu azɔ le wo me o.
But we can’t have that.	Gake míate ŋu akpɔ ema o.
I tried just about everything.	Mete nusianu kloe kpɔ.
He just didn’t know where he was.	Ðeko menya afi si wòle o.

I want to emphasize this point.	Medi be mate gbe ɖe nya sia dzi.

But it’s not working for me.	Gake mele dɔ wɔm nam o.
Please put your hand here.	Taflatse, tsɔ wò asi ɖo afisia.
I know what you want.	Menya nusi dim nèle.
Everyone was fine.	Amesiame nɔ nyuie.
The opposite is true.	To vovo na ema.
The room was warm.	Xɔa me xɔ dzo.
Work on something.	Wɔ dɔ tso nane ŋu.
Perhaps he is praying.	Ðewohĩ ele gbe dom ɖa.
That would take up more space than is available here.	Ema axɔ teƒe geɖe wu esi li le afisia.
I think there must have been a mistake.	Mesusu be vodada aɖe anya nɔ anyi.
On the same day.	Le ŋkeke ma ke dzi.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
In the process, only one man was lost.	Le esia wɔwɔ me la, ŋutsu ɖeka koe bu.
Which is the truth.	Nusi nye nyateƒe.
But many people don’t.	Gake ame geɖe ya mewɔa esia o.
He cannot feel or understand.	Mate ŋu ase le eɖokui me alo ase egɔme o.
Otherwise, it’s not bad.	Ne menye nenema o la, menye nu gbegblẽ o.
Come away now.	Va dzo fifia.
I want to talk to you.	Medi be maƒo nu kpli wò.
And that’s what it is.	Eye emae nye ema.
That was enough for him.	Ema sɔ gbɔ nɛ.
He didn’t do everything right.	Mewɔ nusianu nyuie o.
I am short on time anyway.	Mele kpuie le ɣeyiɣi ŋu le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Everything seems to be working fine.	Edze abe nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie ene.
Maybe he doesn’t know that either.	Ðewohĩ eya hã menya ema o.
I can do that better than he can.	Mate ŋu awɔ ema nyuie wu alesi wòate ŋui.
Again, this is still personal.	Le afisia hã la, esia gakpɔtɔ nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
I always had a job.	Dɔ aɖe nɔa asinye ɣesiaɣi.
He couldn’t turn himself around.	Mete ŋu trɔ eɖokui o.
It is a simple task.	Enye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖe.
What have you done.	Nukae nèwɔ.
By everyone, including myself.	To amesiame dzi, nye ŋutɔ hã mele eme.
The beer was pretty simple.	Bia la nɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Some things we don’t know yet.	Nu aɖewo siwo míenya haɖe o.
We know it will take a little while.	Míenya be axɔ ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe.
It can make it work.	Ate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ.
I congratulated him.	Medo dzidzɔ nɛ.
This way is the complete opposite.	Mɔ sia to vovo kura na ema.
Otherwise, you will have a lot of work to do.	Ne menye nenema o la, dɔ geɖe anɔ asiwò.
I'll call you tomorrow.	Maƒo ka na wò etsɔ.
And a great joy arose.	Eye dzidzɔ gã aɖe do mo ɖa.
Things are different here.	Nuwo to vovo le afisia.
Someone else does this for you.	Ame bubu aɖe wɔa esia na wò.
That was good enough for me.	Ema nyo nam ale gbegbe.
He was briefly angry	Dziku nɔ eŋu kpuie
He didn’t survive.	Metsi agbe o.
Maybe he finally got tired.	Ðewohĩ ɖeɖi te eŋu mlɔeba.
They had no attitude at all.	Nɔnɔme aɖeke menɔ wo si kura o.
I'm fine, actually.	Mele nyuie, le nyateƒe me.
These are people who are barely seeing life.	Ame siawo nye ame siwo le agbe kpɔm ƒã.
He did everything he could to fight that.	Ewɔ nusianu si wòate ŋui tsɔ wɔ avu kple ema.
I stood up.	Metsi tre.
Maybe that’s you.	Ðewohĩ wòe nye ema.
I really, really hope so .	Mele mɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ, nenema .
It was something that was on us.	Enye nane si nɔ mía dzi.
You have to be quick, but not too quick.	Ele be nàwɔ kaba, gake menye kaba akpa o.
I had to go there.	Ele be mayi afima.
It seemed absurd to him.	Edze nɛ be enye nya si me susu mele o.
But that was really good for me.	Gake ema nyo nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You can’t take away from that.	Màte ŋu aɖe nu le ema me o.
Like I had a place for me here.	Abe teƒe aɖe nɔ asinye nam le afisia ene.
One carried a gun.	Ame ɖeka tsɔ tu aɖe ɖe asi.
Lend us your car.	Do wò ʋu na mí.
However, that didn’t work.	Ke hã, ema mewɔ dɔ o.
There are two possibilities.	Nu eve aɖewo li siwo ate ŋu adzɔ.
But this is not always possible.	Gake esia mate ŋu adzɔ ɣesiaɣi o.
It didn’t grow well.	Metsi nyuie o.
Start with the .	Dze egɔme kple .
We have a lot of work to do.	Dɔ geɖe le mía si míawɔ.
Please help us out.	Taflatse kpe ɖe mía ŋu.
It can come out better.	Ate ŋu ado go nyuie wu.
That’s a good job.	Ema nye dɔ nyui aɖe.
Nothing in my life seemed real.	Naneke menɔ nye agbe me dze abe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ene o.
I know everything about my own people.	Menya nusianu tso nye ŋutɔ nye amewo ŋu.
He had no room for anyone else.	Teƒe aɖeke menɔ esi na ame bubu aɖeke o.
I don’t really know anything about it.	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Not too bad either.	Menye nu gbegblẽ boo aɖeke hã o.
You can go as far as your imagination allows.	Àte ŋu ayi afisi wò susu aɖe mɔ na wò le.
It could only take a few weeks.	Kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo koe wòate ŋu axɔ.
He needed more than that in his life.	Ehiã nu geɖe wu ema le eƒe agbe me.
Nothing, and never.	Naneke meli o, eye gbeɖe o.
But just think about that.	Gake bu nya ma ŋu ko.
But there isn’t one.	Gake ɖeke meli o.
But this takes time.	Gake esia xɔa ɣeyiɣi.
I’m surprised he didn’t ask about it.	Ewɔ nuku nam be mebia nya tso eŋu o.
I can find it again.	Mate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu ake.
Nothing is going right tonight.	Naneke mele edzi yim nyuie le zã sia me o.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Menya nusi wòawɔ tso eŋu o.
Maybe it won’t matter.	Ðewohĩ maɖe fu o.
In its first week.	Le eƒe kwasiɖa gbãtɔ me.
I have heard about that.	Mese nu tso nya ma ŋu.
Contact us today!.	Te ɖe mía ŋu egbea!.
He took his time to answer.	Etsɔ eƒe ɣeyiɣi ɖo eŋu.
I will go the other way.	Mayi mɔ bubu dzi.
Exactly the same.	Nenema ke tututu.
He couldn’t really see anything.	Mete ŋu kpɔ naneke ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I want to tell you something.	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖe na wò.
If you like fire, there is a small lake nearby.	Ne dzo dze ŋuwò la, ta sue aɖe te ɖe afima ŋu.
It will be a very difficult one.	Anye esi sesẽ ŋutɔ.
And that is unsustainable.	Eye ema nye nusi mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
Being an adult, you can.	Esi nènye ame gã ta la, àte ŋui.
That’s all it doesn’t matter.	Ema koe mehiã o.
Thank you so much for that.	Akpe geɖe na wò ɖe ema ta.
It was too soon.	Enye kaba akpa.
He is doing very well.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔ.
That’s about as much as anyone can get away with.	Ema sɔ gbɔ abe alesi amesiame ate ŋu akpɔ tso eme ene.
He never understood it.	Mese egɔme kpɔ o.
There is no one else there.	Ame bubu aɖeke mele afima o.
I followed this.	Mewɔ ɖe esia dzi.
They definitely exist.	Wole anyi godoo.
Contradictions arise.	Nya siwo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu la doa mo ɖa.
I hope it works out well.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ nyuie.
It will be good for you.	Anyo na wò.
I am looking forward to getting involved.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be maƒo ɖokuinye ɖe eme.
This didn’t seem upsetting or worrying about this.	Edze abe esia medo dziku alo tsi dzi ɖe nya sia ŋu o ene.
I have two of them.	Wo dometɔ eve le asinye.
Honestly, hard times.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɣeyiɣi sesẽ.
I became very anxious and needed help.	Meva tsi dzi vevie eye mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu.
There is a lot to do.	Nu geɖe li woawɔ.
Forget the whole thing.	Ŋlɔ nu bliboa be.
You can’t help everyone.	Màte ŋu akpe ɖe ame sia ame ŋu o.
There is plenty of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe li.
However, the opposite is true.	Ke hã, nusi to vovo na emae nye nyateƒe.
I had a lot of fun with many of them.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ geɖe kple wo dometɔ geɖe.
It will be just like it was at home.	Anɔ abe alesi wònɔ le aƒeme ene.
There was a man here.	Ŋutsu aɖe nɔ afisia.
But that’s just me talking.	Gake nye koe nye ema le nu ƒom.
Just work on your type.	Ðeko nàwɔ dɔ tso wò ƒomevi ŋu.
But there was a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖe nɔ anyi.
But that seems to be a difficult one.	Gake edze abe ema nye nya sesẽ aɖe ene.
There is no place like home.	Teƒe aɖeke meli si le abe aƒe ene o.
I was a part of it.	Menye eƒe akpa aɖe.
Many people have never heard of these places.	Ame geɖe mese teƒe siawo ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
That’s our reason for being.	Emae nye míaƒe susu si tae míele.
Play with this guy.	Fe le ŋutsu sia ŋu.
But in reality, it will take much longer.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi wu ema.
I knew he was somewhere.	Menya be ele afi aɖe.
At that point, he wasn’t there.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, menɔ afima o.
It looks pretty great now.	Edze abe gã ŋutɔ ene fifia.
But this is nothing new to them.	Gake esia menye nu yeye na wo o.
In this case, it is a good thing.	Le go sia me la, enye nu nyui aɖe.
As you wish.	Abe alesi nèdi ene.
I know that horse.	Menya sɔ ma.
Work is work, and money is money.	Dɔ nye dɔ, eye ga nye ga.
I have some of my own money.	Nye ŋutɔ nye ga aɖewo le asinye.
But that doesn’t work.	Gake ema mewɔa dɔ o.
I’m not the only one.	Menye nye ɖeka koe o.
People lost their jobs.	Amewo ƒe dɔ ge le wo si.
I must have missed something.	Nane anya to ŋunye.
He was not there at this time.	Menɔ afima le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
I made a plan for it.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
That there will only be the better part of me from now on.	Be nye akpa si nyo wu koe anɔ anyi tso fifia dzi.
I made a mistake though.	Mewɔ vodada gake.
I could remember it so vividly.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi nyuie ale gbegbe.
Can you give me a hand with this?	Àte ŋu ana asi nam kple esia?
Never, when he was alive.	Gbeɖe o, esime wònɔ agbe.
But it will do that.	Gake awɔe nenema.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
There was so much.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi.
I don’t want to be that.	Nyemedi be nyee nye ema o.
I don’t want that.	Nyemedi nenema o.
But it is not at all.	Gake menye nenema kura o.
Not yet, it will take a week.	Menye haɖe o, axɔ kwasiɖa ɖeka.
He could have withstood anything.	Ate ŋu anɔ te ɖe nusianu nu hafi.
Something in between.	Nane si le wo dome.
This is the first one.	Esia nye gbãtɔ.
Or on the surface.	Alo le edzi.
All the right people do what they have to do.	Ame siwo katã sɔ la wɔa nu si wòle be woawɔ.
For something.	Na nu aɖe.
He likes a lot about it.	Nu geɖe dzɔa dzi nɛ le eŋu.
This new route is amazing!	Mɔ yeye sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ!
But these people really have no issue.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nya aɖeke mele ame siawo si o.
This is just one aspect of it.	Esia nye eƒe akpa ɖeka ko.
But it is true.	Gake enye nyateƒe.
It’s not the right thing to do.	Menye nusi sɔ o.
I have heard of this before.	Mese nya sia ŋu nya kpɔ.
Everything seemed real.	Nusianu dze abe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
See how that works long term.	Kpɔ alesi ema wɔa dɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee ɖa.
I hope someone can help me move forward here.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye mayi ŋgɔ le afisia.
In the same year.	Le ƒe ma ke me.
But everything was devastating.	Gake nusianu gblẽ nu le ame ŋu ŋutɔ.
Can someone please explain.	Ðe ame aɖe ate ŋu aɖe eme nam taflatse.
The house is beautiful.	Aƒea nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
Please, remember.	Taflatse, ɖo ŋku edzi.
This cannot be realistic.	Esia mate ŋu anye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
We can’t see his face.	Míate ŋu akpɔ eƒe mo o.
This is enough for many, but not all.	Esia sɔ gbɔ na ame geɖe, gake menye wo katã o.
I know how this is, though.	Menya alesi esia le, gake.
I know your character well.	Menya wò nɔnɔme nyuie.
He had no children.	Vi aɖeke menɔ esi o.
He wasn’t that kind of person.	Menye ame ma ƒomevi o.
And everyone knows that.	Eye amesiame nya esia.
Look at everything.	Nusianu kpɔ ɖa.
You can see what’s possible, what’s possible.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusi ate ŋu adzɔ, nusi ate ŋu adzɔ.
But really, nothing was ever really new.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, naneke menɔ yeye ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o.
I don’t know anything else.	Nyemenya nu bubu aɖeke o.
Which tells me two things.	Nusi gblɔ nu eve nam.
There are two reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae.
This market was very small.	Asi sia nɔ sue ŋutɔ.
You are my rock now.	Wòe nye nye kpe fifia.
I tell you, it is a thing.	Megblɔ na mi be, enye nu.
I know how to do that.	Menya alesi mawɔ emae.
I said this very seriously.	Megblɔ nya sia vevie ŋutɔ.
Do one thing at a time.	Wɔ nu ɖeka ɖeka.
But none of them are there.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖeke mele afima o.
And about time, too.	Eye le ɣeyiɣi ŋu hã.
Take tomorrow, too.	Tsɔ etsɔ hã.
I just did my job.	Ðeko mewɔ nye dɔa.
It's a big deal.	Nye nya gã aɖe.
Apparently, I am included.	Edze abe nye hã le eme ene.
Rising prices won’t surprise you.	Ga siwo le dzi yim la mawɔ nuku na wò o.
He doesn’t need my help.	Mehiã nye kpekpeɖeŋu o.
Two weeks have passed.	Kwasiɖa eve va yi.
Everything fit together.	Nusianu sɔ ɖe wo nɔewo nu.
You can upset your character.	Àte ŋu ado dziku na wò nɔnɔme.
It didn’t take me long to figure it out.	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi hafi mete ŋu bu eŋu o.
Either he was happy or he wasn’t.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ alo mekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
Her dog was doing well.	Eƒe avu la nɔ nu wɔm nyuie.
Many people have already died.	Ame geɖe ku xoxo.
That’s a good idea.	Ema nye susu nyui aɖe.
There is a lake behind the building.	Ta aɖe le xɔa megbe.
It could also be something completely different.	Ate ŋu anye nusi to vovo kura hã.
Turn your back.	Trɔ wò megbe.
I can never go without food.	Nyemate ŋu ayi nuɖuɖu manɔmee gbeɖe o.
I was too old for a dog.	Metsi akpa na avu.
The thing itself.	Nu la ŋutɔ.
It is going very well.	Ele edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔ.
Now, on to why you are here.	Azɔ, yi ɖe nusita nèle afisia dzi.
These times call for more.	Ɣeyiɣi siawo bia be woawɔ nu geɖe wu.
Give it your time.	Na wò ɣeyiɣi.
This may not be possible.	Ðewohĩ esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Eventually, the truth will come out.	Mlɔeba la, nyateƒea ado go.
But I don't know how to make it work.	Gake nyemenya alesi mawɔ ana wòawɔ dɔ o.
It’s all and nothing with a couple of things.	Enye nusianu kple naneke o kple nu eve aɖewo.
And it is in my life right today.	Eye ele nye agbe me egbea tututu.
Many people approved of the project.	Ame geɖe da asi ɖe dɔa dzi.
I can’t really understand what happened.	Nyemate ŋu ase nusi dzɔ gɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I looked too old.	Medze abe ɖe metsi akpa ene.
There are two places.	Teƒe eve ye li.
Disappointed and discouraged.	Dzi ɖe le wo ƒo eye dzi ɖe le wo ƒo.
It was without any desire to have a home.	Enye didi aɖeke manɔmee be aƒe nanɔ ye si.
I can’t stand it anymore.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu azɔ o.
I'll work on that.	Mawɔ dɔ tso ema ŋu.
I don’t know how to do it.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔe o.
He couldn't say anything else.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nya bubu aɖeke o.
I don’t want this.	Nyemedi esia o.
In reality, however, the opposite is true.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo kura na emae nye nyateƒe.
All at the same time.	Wo katã le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
I know that’s you.	Menya be wòe nye ema.
You can find everything there.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusianu le afima.
Clearly, it is important.	Edze ƒã be ele vevie.
He never made a big deal about it.	Mewɔ nu gã aɖeke tso eŋu kpɔ o.
Good luck to you tomorrow.	Dzidzɔ na wò etsɔ.
This surprised him completely.	Esia wɔ nuku nɛ kura.
That’s what happened here.	Emae nye nusi dzɔ le afisia.
They are happy.	Dzi dzɔa wo.
I know what it is, but that doesn’t matter.	Menya nusi wònye, gake ema mehiã o.
That was my first home.	Emae nye nye aƒe gbãtɔ.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I don’t know anything.	Nyemenya naneke o.
It was something he enjoyed more than anything.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ nɛ wu nusianu.
In the house.	Le aƒea me.
Nothing and everything.	Naneke kple nusianu o.
Incredibly, it worked.	Le mɔ si mexɔ se o nu la, ewɔ dɔ.
This isn’t surprising.	Esia mewɔ nuku o.
He won’t let me.	Maɖe mɔ nam o.
It might actually work.	Ðewohĩ awɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That wouldn’t be easy.	Ema manɔ bɔbɔe o.
I am going to have breakfast now.	Mele ŋdi nuɖuɖu ɖu ge fifia.
But it’s not impossible.	Gake menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o ye wònye o.
Eventually, it will happen.	Mlɔeba la, ava eme.
He just did everything he had to do to win.	Ðeko wòwɔ nusianu si wòle be wòawɔ hafi aɖu dzi.
Something in my mouth.	Nane le nye nu me.
In fact, it’s amazing.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Keep up the good work, man.	Yi dɔ nyui la dzi, ame.
Now things are very different.	Fifia nuwo to vovo kura.
That makes a point.	Ema na nya aɖe le eme.
This is in stark contrast to food waste.	Esia to vovo kura na nuɖuɖu ƒe gbegblẽ.
It seems to be working now.	Edze abe ele dɔ wɔm fifia ene.

You have to make your way.	Ele be nàwɔ wò mɔ.
My life, such as it is, will be easier.	Nye agbe, abe alesi wòle ene, anɔ bɔbɔe nam wu.

He is not a small dog.	Menye avu sue aɖee wònye o.

His death shocked everyone.	Eƒe ku wɔ nuku na amesiame.

It was amazing to be a part of it.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ be menye eƒe akpa aɖe.
But in the end, it never works.	Gake mlɔeba la, mewɔa dɔ gbeɖe o.

Money is needed.	Ga hiã.
No one knows.	Ame aɖeke menya o.

In fact, many people do.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame geɖe wɔa esia.

Stop right there.	Dzudzɔ le afima tututu.
Some of them have already done so.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo wɔe xoxo.
But instead of that.	Gake ɖe ema teƒe la.
He may never be able to find one of his own.	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu akpɔ eya ŋutɔ tɔ aɖeke gbeɖe o.
That is so difficult.	Nya ma sesẽ ale gbegbe.

Same time last year.	Ɣeyiɣi ma ke me le ƒe si va yi me.
I let him go home.	Meɖe asi le eŋu yi aƒeme.
That’s a good thing.	Ema nye nu nyui aɖe.
He doesn't remember who sent it.	Meɖo ŋku amesi ɖoe ɖa dzi o.
Look at that goat running over there.	Kpɔ gbɔ̃ ma le du dzi le afima.
Why is it that? 	Nukatae nye?
We don’t know when.	Míenya ɣekaɣie o.
Nothing like that here, of course.	Naneke mele alea le afisia ya o.
I wondered if this was why he wasn’t worried.	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe esia tae metsi dzi ɖo o hã.
It won’t be useful.	Maɖe vi aɖeke o.
He will probably be there.	Anye be anɔ afima.
I understand you are busy.	Mese egɔme be vovo mele ŋuwò o.
So many different opportunities.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe siwo to vovo ale gbegbe.
He took his time.	Etsɔ eƒe ɣeyiɣi.
Everything is hot.	Nusianu xɔ dzo.
They may work better for you.	Ðewohĩ woawɔ dɔ nyuie wu na wò.
There is nothing there.	Naneke mele afima o.
He took two.	Etsɔ eve.
He is really doing some great things for this city.	Ele nu gã aɖewo wɔm na du sia ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You are in a different place now.	Èle teƒe bubu fifia.
It is this issue.	Enye nya sia.
They had impossible names.	Ŋkɔ siwo mate ŋu adzɔ o nɔ wo si.
Some schools are doing a great job.	Suku aɖewo le dɔ gã aɖe wɔm.
No one can do it alone.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔe eya ɖeka o.
There was no one inside.	Ame aɖeke menɔ eme o.
Maybe he’s busy.	Ðewohĩ vovo mele eŋu o.
You the you.	Tu la tu.
I must be missing something obvious.	Anɔ eme be nane si dze ƒã la bu nam.
It seems to me that you would be the guy who would know.	Edze nam be wòe anye ŋutsu si anya.
It’s too weird.	Ewɔ nuku akpa.
There is something wrong with that.	Nane gblẽ le ema ŋu.
But this is a first.	Gake esia nye gbãtɔ.
I can’t let go of it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu o.
Only I can do this.	Nye ɖeka koe ate ŋu awɔ esia.
The reasons for this are many.	Susu siwo gbɔ esia tso la sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
He felt what he was doing.	Nusi wɔm wònɔ la se le eɖokui me.
I can stand anyone.	Mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe amesiame nu.
I just felt like there was so much more to that moment.	Ðeko mese le ɖokuinye me be nu geɖe wu le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
This was some time ago.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye sia.
This guy reminds me of a big kid.	Ŋutsu sia ɖo ŋku ɖevi gã aɖe dzi nam.
I stayed behind.	Metsi megbe.
I definitely felt that way.	Mese le ɖokuinye me nenema godoo.
This sounds like a personal problem.	Esia ɖi abe ame ŋutɔ ƒe kuxi ene.
A minor issue arose, which passed.	Nya sue aɖe do mo ɖa, si va yi.
I like these people here.	Ame siawo dzɔa dzi nam le afisia.
And it all surprised me.	Eye esia katã wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
And water surprised him.	Eye tsi na wòwɔ nuku nɛ.
This is what he has.	Esia le esi.
The air was thick with blood.	Ya la nɔ ʋu ƒom.
I would be the same.	Nye hã manɔ nenema.
I don’t know what else.	Nyemenya nu bubu kae o.
I’m glad you liked it.	Edzɔ dzi nam be edzɔ dzi na wò.
He couldn't believe what he had just done.	Mete ŋu xɔ nusi wòwɔ teti koe nye ema la dzi se o.
He didn’t seem to know what was going on either.	Edze abe menya nusi nɔ edzi yim hã o ene.
Not at all.	Menye nenema kura o.
They didn’t mind me seeing.	Meɖe fu na wo be makpɔ nu o.
Everything is real as it is now.	Nusianu nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ abe alesi wòle fifia ene.
We have to be really focused.	Ele be míaƒe susu nanɔ nu ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He was a ‘can do’ man.	Enye ŋutsu si ‘ate ŋu awɔ’.
Always the same thing.	Nu ɖeka ma ke ɣesiaɣi.
Now what is it? 	Azɔ nukae?
Until he didn’t.	Vaseɖe esime mewɔe nenema o.
This is totally appropriate.	Esia sɔ kura.
And so it is now.	Fifia hã wòle nenema.
It didn’t take long.	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
I said go ahead.	Megblɔ be yi edzi.
This process will cost you money.	Dɔ sia axɔ ga le asiwò.
No job is important.	Dɔ aɖeke mele vevie o.
Obviously, this is not realistic.	Edze ƒã be esia menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Anyone can work.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
Same on my part.	Nenema ke le nye akpa dzi.
It looks quite like its original form.	Edze abe eƒe nɔnɔme gbãtɔ ene kura.
He will be happy here.	Akpɔ dzidzɔ le afisia.
A year in advance.	Ƒe ɖeka do ŋgɔ.
This is not easy.	Esia mele bɔbɔe o.
His heart was broken.	Eƒe dzi ƒo.
And it’s kind of bad.	Eye wònye nu gbegblẽ ƒomevi aɖe.
And they are like that.	Eye wole nenema.
There has to be a mistake here somewhere.	Ele be vodada aɖe nanɔ afisia le afi aɖe.
Everything else.	Nusianu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
I am the one who has something in common.	Nyee nye amesi nane sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
It is a very difficult challenge.	Enye kuxi sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
More of the same this year.	Nu ma ke geɖe wu le ƒe sia me.
I don’t think it’s there yet.	Nyemesusu be ele afima haɖe o.

I am somewhere else.	Mele teƒe bubu aɖe.
I’m glad he’s doing well for her.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ele nu nyui wɔm nɛ.
Many did not survive.	Ame geɖe metsi agbe o.
He wasn’t going to do this.	Menye ɖe wòle esia wɔ ge o.
He didn't seem angry.	Edze abe medo dziku o ene.
On any given day.	Le ŋkeke ɖesiaɖe dzi.
This season couldn’t get any better.	Ɣeyiɣi sia mete ŋu nyo ɖe edzi o.
In this case, this is the other way around.	Le esia me la, esia nye mɔ bubu.
But everything is different now.	Gake nusianu to vovo fifia.
He couldn’t imagine food.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nuɖuɖu le susu me o.
But he was different, too.	Gake eya hã to vovo.
I got this one.	Mexɔ esia.
He fell twice.	Edze anyi zi eve.
I may not have much time.	Ðewohĩ ɣeyiɣi geɖe manɔ asinye o.
And there was nothing.	Eye naneke menɔ anyi o.
They are doing well.	Wole edzi dzem nyuie.
But think about this.	Gake bu esia ŋu kpɔ.
No one believed him, so he said nothing.	Ame aɖeke meka ɖe edzi o, eya ta megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
This old building is under attack.	Wole xɔ xoxo sia dzi dzem.
Two can play as easily as one.	Eve ate ŋu aƒo bɔbɔe abe ɖeka ene.
I have no help to call.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke mele asinye maƒo ka na o.
Two are important.	Eve le vevie.
Nice to meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò.
On the on and on.	Le edzi yi edzi.
And, of course,.	Eye, le nyateƒe me la,...
But he didn’t want any of them.	Gake medi wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
I hoped he could feel it.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be ate ŋu ase le eɖokui me.
He couldn’t help himself.	Mete ŋu kpe ɖe eɖokui ŋu o.
I have to keep an eye on him.	Ele be nye ŋku nanɔ eŋu.
I don’t know how to do that.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ emae o.
I knew that would be his first thought.	Menya be emae anye eƒe susu gbãtɔ.
A book, maybe.	Agbalẽ aɖe, ɖewohĩ.
That’s a real thing.	Ema nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This could be an opportunity for me.	Esia ate ŋu anye mɔnukpɔkpɔ nam.
You can finally find them here.	Àte ŋu ake ɖe wo ŋu le afisia mlɔeba.
I’m interested in you.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò.
I really want to get to know you better.	Medi vevie be manya wò nyuie wu.

That’s not my concern.	Menye emae nye nusi ŋu metsi dzi ɖo o.
I do want to talk to him.	Medi be maƒo nu kplii ya.
It was also very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ hã.
There was a man.	Ame aɖe nɔ anyi.
Not for him.	Menye nɛ o.
He didn’t want to go.	Medi be yeayi o.
Most of the time he didn’t.	Zi geɖe la, mewɔe nenema o.
That makes so much sense.	Susu le nya ma me ale gbegbe.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Naneke mate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu nyateƒea o.
. . . .	.
But there was no one else there.	Gake ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afi ma o.
And it’s not like that anymore.	Eye megale nenema o.
It’s an opportunity for me to do that.	Enye mɔnukpɔkpɔ nam be mawɔ ema.
For another time and place.	Ɣeyiɣi bubu kple teƒe bubu tae.
Something is wrong here.	Nane gblẽ le afisia.
No one knows what happened there.	Ame aɖeke menya nu si dzɔ le afi ma o.
I don’t want to say anything to anything.	Nyemedi be magblɔ nya aɖeke na nya aɖeke o.
He had a very good life.	Agbe nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ esi.
Everything made sense now.	Susu nɔ nusianu me fifia.
In fact, there isn’t one.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖeke meli o.
I am a person.	Ame aɖee menye.
However, where the issue lies.	Ke hã, afisi nya la le.
Mine is a brand new piece.	Nye tɔ nye akpa yeye kura.
I can’t get close to them.	Nyemate ŋu ate ɖe wo ŋu o.
I’m sure you’re tired.	Meka ɖe edzi be ɖeɖi te ŋuwò.
I need to know you can do that.	Ele be manya be àte ŋu awɔ ema.
I was the same way.	Nye hã menɔ nenema.
But reality became too insistent.	Gake nu ŋutɔŋutɔ va nɔ te tɔ ɖe edzi akpa.
We know what we can do here.	Míenya nusi míate ŋu awɔ le afisia.
It didn’t work out too well.	Mewɔ dɔ nyuie akpa o.
Bookings are due in the next few days.	Ele be woawɔ agbalẽ le ŋkeke ʋɛ siwo gbɔna me.
I know this.	Menya esia.
Many people helped with the project.	Ame geɖe kpe asi ɖe dɔa ŋu.
His hair was also wet.	Eƒe ɖa hã ƒo tsi.
Be more careful.	Kpɔ nyuie wu.
He had no death wish.	Ku ƒe didi aɖeke menɔ esi o.
Not by hand.	Menye to asi dzi o.
I am the one who matters.	Nyee le vevie.
I have to go talk to them.	Ele be mayi aƒo nu kpli wo.
I don’t think anyone does.	Nyemesusu be ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
In his own way.	Le eya ŋutɔ ƒe mɔ nu.

There has to be something we can do.	Ele be nane nanɔ anyi si míate ŋu awɔ.
It doesn't seem to be working though.	Edze abe mele dɔ wɔm o ke hã.
That sounds simple enough.	Ema ɖi nu bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
Please, just do it.	Taflatse, wɔe ko.
The present is lost.	Fifia la bu.
One person got inside.	Ame ɖeka ge ɖe eme.
There was no fire.	Dzo aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
He doesn’t seem to be short.	Edze abe menye ame kpuie wònye o ene.
Some of my stuff is here in the main house.	Nye nuwo dometɔ aɖewo le aƒe gã la me afisia.
Like the last time.	Abe zi mamlɛtɔ ene.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anye nenema o.
Not too challenging but not too easy.	Menye kuxi akpa o gake mele bɔbɔe akpa o.
You are his rock.	Wòe nye eƒe kpe.
It was a small school.	Suku sue aɖee wònye.
Other results were less obvious.	Nu bubu siwo do tso eme la medze ƒã boo o.
There were very few from.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ anyi tso.
But neither is life.	Gake agbe hã mele nenema o.
There is no room for anything else.	Teƒe aɖeke meli na nu bubu aɖeke wɔwɔ o.
I couldn’t even make a phone call.	Nyemete ŋu ƒo ka hã o.
I'm just not going to do it.	Ðeko nyemele ewɔ ge o.
I’m just the only one.	Nye ɖeka ko.
I had a mistake.	Vodada aɖe dzɔ ɖe dzinye.
Managed to squeeze two good days together.	Te ŋu ƒo ŋkeke nyui eve ɖekae.
This is actually nothing new.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia menye nu yeye o.
He refuses to do anything.	Egbea naneke wɔwɔ.
There are many things in them.	Nu geɖe le wo me.
I’m still the same guy.	Nyee nye ŋutsu ma ke kokoko.
But enough food.	Gake nuɖuɖu si sɔ.
I am looking forward to it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ.
You can’t know how things will go.	Màte ŋu anya alesi nuwo ayi o.
People are not his thing.	Amewo menye eƒe nu o.
That’s a valid alternative.	Ema nye mɔ bubu si sɔ.
I was so angry.	Medo dziku ale gbegbe.
It looks like it though.	Edze abe ɖe wòle ene gake.
Usually it is.	Zi geɖe la, ele nenema.
The car skidded on the wet road.	Ʋua ƒu du le mɔ si dzi tsi le la dzi.
We couldn’t have done it.	Míate ŋu awɔe hafi o.
He refuses to do this.	Egbea esia wɔwɔ.
They were discouraged.	Dzi ɖe le wo ƒo.
I told you where you are.	Megblɔ afi si nèle la na wò.
Many of them have already died.	Wo dometɔ geɖe ku xoxo.
Have plenty of food and water.	Nuɖuɖu kple tsi geɖe nanɔ asiwò.
My last night.	Nye zã mamlɛtɔ.
He gave her a goblet.	Etsɔ go aɖe nɛ.
Again, not so well.	Azɔ hã, menye nyuie nenema gbegbe o.
I just don’t know where to go from here.	Ðeko nyemenya afi si mayi tso afisia o.
The summer is finally over.	Dzomeŋɔli la va yi mlɔeba.
However, at times.	Ke hã, le ɣeyiɣi aɖewo me.
Things are bad enough as they are.	Nuwo gblẽ ale gbegbe abe alesi wole ene.
He’s just going to do it.	Ðeko wòle ewɔ ge.
This rule is in force.	Se sia le dɔ wɔm.
He didn’t realize his mistake.	Mekpɔ eƒe vodada dze sii o.
There were also some small rooms.	Xɔ sue aɖewo hã nɔ afima.
It can be anywhere.	Ate ŋu anɔ afi sia afi.
This is a man who works hard.	Esia nye ŋutsu aɖe si doa vevie nu.
There are two parts to it.	Akpa eve le eŋu.
You just don’t have time.	Ðeko ɣeyiɣi mele asiwò o.
I wonder which one.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be wo dometɔ kae hã.
Some of them are good.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nyo.
Anger was more impressive.	Dziku wɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi wu.
Obviously, no two sides are in the same piece.	Edze ƒã be akpa eve aɖeke mele akpa ɖeka me o.
It doesn’t work well.	Mewɔa dɔ nyuie o.
Your hair is too long for this outfit.	Wò ɖa didi akpa na awu sia.
It may be true.	Ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
I also don’t know if I did it right.	Nyemenya hã ne mewɔe nyuie o.
I put my foot down.	Metsɔ nye afɔ ɖo anyi.
That’s why we’re never going to do it.	Esia tae míele ewɔ ge akpɔ gbeɖe o ɖo.
And it’s one of the most beautiful things.	Eye enye nu siwo nya kpɔ wu la dometɔ ɖeka.
This is open to all.	Esia ʋu ɖi na amewo katã.
This too will pass away.	Esia hã ava yi.
I was that kid.	Nyee nye ɖevi ma.
But it is possible.	Gake anya wɔ.
He probably won’t.	Anɔ eme be mawɔe nenema o.
But this is good for him.	Gake esia nyo nɛ.
He has another strategy.	Aɖaŋu bubu aɖe le esi.
I know that’s important to you.	Menya be ema le vevie na wò.
I think that’s you for me.	Mesusu be wòe nye ema nam.
I am the only one who can help me.	Nye ɖeka koe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
It splits into two parts.	Ema ɖe akpa eve me.
No part of me is wrong.	Nye akpa aɖeke menye vodada o.
Use very warm water.	Zã tsi si me dzo le ŋutɔ.
This city has something for everyone.	Nane le du sia me na amesiame.
I'm a little hot right now.	Mexɔ dzo vie fifia.
He would do anything for me.	Awɔ nusianu nam.
It’s a good thing.	Enye nu nyui aɖe.
I’m not the only one who can do that.	Menye nye ɖeka koe ate ŋu awɔ ema o.
But it’s just you.	Gake wò koe.
There is no mistake here.	Vodada aɖeke mele afisia o.
This will prove who is the better candidate.	Esia aɖo kpe amesi nye ame si nyo wu dzi.
Now do something about it.	Azɔ wɔ nane tso eŋu.
And it worked.	Eye ewɔ dɔ.
I am a teacher.	Nyee nye nufiala.
Where anything is possible.	Afisi nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ le.
I actually enjoyed it a lot.	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
His work will be over very soon.	Eƒe dɔa awu enu kpuie ŋutɔ.
Do this more often.	Wɔ esia zi geɖe wu.
Still two years away from that.	Ƒe eve gakpɔtɔ le ema lalam.
We have the whole day.	Ŋkeke bliboa le mía si.
He didn’t tell her anything.	Megblɔ naneke nɛ o.
A few days later, the same thing happened.	Le ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo megbe la, nu ma ke dzɔ.
I would really like to lend a hand.	Madi vevie be mado asi ɖe ame ŋu.
He’s always been a man with a plan.	Enye ŋutsu si si ɖoɖo aɖe le ɣesiaɣi.
I definitely would have done things differently.	Anye ne mawɔ nuwo le mɔ bubu nu godoo.
He put a lot of effort into this.	Edze agbagba geɖe le esia me.
However, two years ago we had the same problem.	Ke hã, ƒe eve enye sia la, kuxi ma ke nɔ mía ŋu.
It usually doesn’t work though.	Zi geɖe la, mewɔa dɔ o gake.
And something else.	Eye nu bubu aɖe hã.
He will eventually discover this.	Ava ke ɖe esia ŋu mlɔeba.
It’s a tough one though.	Enye ɖeka sesẽ aɖe ke hã.
It can last one to two weeks.	Ate ŋu anɔ anyi kwasiɖa ɖeka va ɖo eve.
I should have just let it go.	Ðeko wòle be maɖe asi le eŋu hafi.
I don’t see how we can do it.	Nyemekpɔ alesi míate ŋu awɔe o.
It’s pretty clear what you need to do.	Eme kɔ nyuie be nusi wòle be nàwɔ.
That day didn’t come.	Gbe ma meva o.
And there is.	Eye li.
He focused on his hand and foot placement.	Eƒe susu nɔ eƒe asi kple afɔ ƒe ɖoɖo ŋu.
He couldn’t fall down.	Mete ŋu dze anyi o.
Food is life.	Nuɖuɖu nye agbe.
He didn’t care about her.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ o.
It may not work that way.	Ðewohĩ mawɔ dɔ nenema o.
There will be another one.	Bubu aɖe hã anɔ anyi.
These two problems seem very similar.	Edze abe kuxi eve siawo ɖi wo nɔewo ŋutɔ ene.
I took a step.	Meɖe afɔ aɖe.
It is not true at all.	Menye nyateƒe kura o.
That means he has to work at home.	Ema fia be ele be wòawɔ dɔ le aƒeme.
Many people got sick.	Ame geɖe dze dɔ.
Nothing to do now.	Naneke meli woawɔ fifia o.
They are like you and me.	Wole abe nye kple wò ene.
A car is just a machine.	Mɔ̃ aɖe koe ʋu nye.
He didn’t get there after the fact.	Meɖo afima le nyateƒea megbe o.
There is still much work to be done.	Dɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.
There’s always something new, something more challenging.	Nu yeye aɖe nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi, nane si sesẽ wu.
I didn’t get a job because of this.	Nyemekpɔ dɔ le esia ta o.
That’s what does this.	Emae wɔa esia.
Go to your room.	Yi wò xɔ me.
He can go anytime.	Ate ŋu ayi ɣesiaɣi.
Its very simple.	Eƒe bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Which is more often true.	Nusi nye nyateƒe zi geɖe wu.
Many of us went to school together.	Mía dometɔ geɖe de suku ɖekae kpɔ.
It will be over.	Awu enu.
It will come in its own way.	Ava le eya ŋutɔ ƒe mɔ nu.
It was so clear.	Eme kɔ nyuie ale gbegbe.
Finally, ask us.	Mlɔeba la, bia mí.
What happened after that.	Nusi dzɔ le ema megbe.
You have to make some strong assumptions there.	Ele be nàwɔ susu sesẽ aɖewo le afima.
No real surprise there.	Mewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ le afima o.
He set off on his own.	Edze mɔ le eɖokui si.
It will never be the same!	Manɔ abe tsã ene gbeɖe o!
There is food here.	Nuɖuɖu le afisia.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe tae wòle alea ɖo.
It seems to be the case.	Edze abe ɖe wòle nenema ene.
Now, open your eyes.	Azɔ, ʋu ŋku.
King said he might have gone home.	Fia gblɔ be ɖewohĩ yeayi aƒeme hafi.
And you never know about these things.	Eye mènya nu tso nu siawo ŋu gbeɖe o.
These things are not true.	Nu siawo menye nyateƒe o.
This work is balanced.	Dɔ sia da sɔ.
That’s as simple as that.	Ema le bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
He probably did more with it.	Anɔ eme be ewɔ nu geɖe wu kpe ɖe eŋu.
It didn't die.	Ga la ku.
That did two things.	Ema wɔ nu eve.
That will definitely happen soon.	Ema ava eme kpuie godoo.
He focused on the issue at hand.	Etsɔ eƒe susu ɖo nya si nɔ edzi yim la ŋu.
Me, well.	Nye, nyuie.
I needed to get out of the house.	Ehiã be mado le aƒea me.
Something that cleared me up.	Nane si me kɔ.
There are two cars between us.	Ʋu eve le mía dome.
I don’t really know what’s going on.	Nyemenya nusi le edzi yim tututu o.
You can handle this.	Àte ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ.
I think it may not have been active.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ mewɔ dɔ vevie o.
That’s a good thing.	Nya nyui aɖee nye ema.
No one saw anything.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ naneke o.
He couldn't tell what time it was.	Mete ŋu gblɔ ɣeyiɣi si me wòle o.
It will do very well.	Awɔe nyuie ŋutɔ.
This was very exciting for me.	Esia do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
Over the next few months.	Le ɣleti ʋɛ siwo gbɔna me.
That didn’t take long.	Ema mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
He wasn’t busy at all.	Vovo menɔ eŋu kura o.
At least so far.	Vaseɖe fifia ya teti.
Again, this is good news.	Le afisia hã la, nya nyui aɖee nye esia.
My house is my house.	Aƒe nye aƒe nye.
I don’t know his first name.	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ gbãtɔ o.

He couldn’t understand what had happened.	Mete ŋu se nusi dzɔ la gɔme o.

Breaking up is easier.	Gbegbe le bɔbɔe wu.
However this may not be the case.	Ke hã ɖewohĩ esia manɔ nenema o.
Turn around to it.	Trɔ ɖe eŋu.
By all means, thank them.	To mɔ sia mɔ nu la, da akpe na wo.

Two would be better, but one would be fine.	Eve anyo wu, gake ɖeka ya anyo.

There was really nothing anyone could do for him.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke menɔ anyi si ame aɖe ate ŋu awɔ nɛ o.
Every man does his job.	Ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe wɔa eƒe dɔ.
Say what you want about it.	Gblɔ nusi nèdi tso eŋu.
A trap of death.	Ku ƒe mɔ̃ aɖe.
Give the dog a bone.	Na ƒu aɖe avu la.
Of them, only two had any children.	Le wo dome la, ame eve koe dzi vi aɖeke.
He has the better strategy.	Aɖaŋu si nyo wu la le esi.
Be careful what you wish for.	Kpɔ nyuie le nusi nèdi ŋu.
It’s not like it’s important.	Menye abe alesi wòle vevie ene o.
There was nothing he could do for her.	Naneke meli si wòate ŋu awɔ nɛ o.
We are in a completely different situation now.	Míele nɔnɔme bubu kura me fifia.
Now let me speak.	Azɔ na maƒo nu.
Maybe there really was something here.	Ðewohĩ nane nɔ afisia ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But his home was never her home.	Gake eƒe aƒe menye eƒe aƒe gbeɖe o.
That’s a really good thing.	Ema nye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It didn’t work.	Mewɔ dɔ o.
I told them everything.	Megblɔ nya sia nya na wo.
This is the most helpful thing in the long run.	Esia nye nusi akpe ɖe ame ŋu wu le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe megbe.
It was a lot of help.	Enye kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe ŋutɔ.
Maybe we can help each other.	Ðewohĩ míate ŋu akpe ɖe mía nɔewo ŋu.
Mary thought carefully before answering.	Maria bu eŋu nyuie hafi ɖo eŋu.
That’s a really big deal.	Ema nye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You can handle them.	Àte ŋu akpɔ wo gbɔ.
This project has been going on for years.	Dɔ sia le edzi yim ƒe geɖe.

I can’t do it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe o.
I am moving on with my life.	Mele nye agbe dzi yim.
I do not know.	Nyemenya o.
He never wanted me or him.	Medi nye alo eya gbeɖe o.
Help with this post.	Kpe asi ɖe nya sia ŋu.
That is, in a way, very good news.	Ema nye, le mɔ aɖe nu la, nya nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
And you’re very upset.	Eye dzi ku wò ŋutɔ.
Please let me know what you think.	Taflatse na manya nusi nèsusu.
I have two of them.	Eve le asinye.
In fact, that is not quite true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nya ma menye nyateƒe tututu o.
It seemed like a year ago.	Edze abe ƒe aɖee nye ema ene.
There was nothing else on it about them.	Nu bubu aɖeke menɔ edzi si ku ɖe wo ŋu o.
I like this kind of thing.	Nu sia ƒomevi dzɔa dzi nam.
That time has passed, but the damage has been done.	Ɣeyiɣi ma va yi, gake nu gblẽ le eŋu.
I shouldn’t call him now.	Mele be maƒo ka nɛ fifia o.
But not like you.	Gake menye abe wò ene o.
None of us expect you to do anything other than that.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mele mɔ kpɔm be nàwɔ nu bubu aɖeke wu ema o.
I would like to know more about this.	Madi be manya nu geɖe tso esia ŋu.
I am living from hand to mouth.	Mele agbe tso asi me yi nu me.
That was very bad.	Ema gblẽ nu ŋutɔ.
I think it would be a good thing.	Mesusu be anye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
This can happen for a number of reasons.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ le susu geɖe ta.
It was incredible to work with him.	Enye nusi mexɔ se o be mewɔ dɔ kplii.
Yours will be the same.	Wò tɔ hã anɔ nenema.
I want to do that too.	Nye hã medi be mawɔ ema.
I need to know everything.	Ele be manya nusianu.
But this time it will be you.	Gake fifia ya la, wòe anye.
Last night was more than anything he could have hoped for.	Zã si va yi la wu nusianu si wòate ŋu akpɔ mɔ na hafi.
What happened happened.	Nusi dzɔ la dzɔ.
If it’s a good night, we can walk.	Ne zã nyui aɖee la, míate ŋu azɔ.
Some people have died too.	Ame aɖewo hã ku.
Consider the money in the market.	Bu ga si le asi me ŋu kpɔ.
I know a lot more strong men.	Menya ŋutsu sesẽ geɖe wu.
I lost my job.	Nye dɔ ge le asinye.
His head was raised.	Eƒe ta kɔ ɖe dzi.
Try a thousand times.	Te kpɔ zi akpe ɖeka.
As was a big foot.	Abe alesi afɔ gã aɖe nɔ ene.
I want to know what.	Medi be manya nusi.
I fight to keep going.	Mewɔa avu be mayi edzi.
I really enjoyed it thank you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ akpe na wò.
He lost one of his legs.	Eƒe afɔ ɖeka bu.
Just consider the real reasons why.	Bu susu ŋutɔŋutɔ siwo tae wòle alea ɖo ko ŋu kpɔ.
It wasn’t hot in any way.	Mexɔ dzo le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I was as surprised as you were.	Ewɔ nuku nam abe wò ke ene.
Your people.	Wò amewo.
And it’s kind of the last straw.	Eye enye gbe mamlɛtɔ ƒomevi aɖe.
There is nothing here for him.	Naneke mele afisia nɛ o.
No reason, but it happened.	Susu aɖeke meli si tae o, gake edzɔ.
It won’t be easy.	Manɔ bɔbɔe o.
It’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
But there should be no mistakes.	Gake mele be vodada aɖeke nanɔ anyi o.
I like anything right.	Nusianu si le eteƒe la dzɔa dzi nam.
I thought that was beautiful.	Mesusu be ema nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
This does not seem to be the case anymore.	Edze abe alea megale alea o ene.
It’s been two months.	Ɣleti eve enye sia.
It was too soon.	Enye kaba akpa.
I can’t stay here anymore.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afisia azɔ o.
There is nothing new about this, of course.	Nu yeye aɖeke mele esia ŋu o ya.
Everything is so different now.	Nusianu to vovo ale gbegbe fifia.
But I don’t really expect much trouble from behind.	Gake nyemele mɔ kpɔm na kuxi boo aɖeke tso megbe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
No work as of course.	Dɔ aɖeke wɔwɔ abe alesi wòle edzi yim ene ya o.
A year ago that wouldn’t have been the case.	Ƒe ɖeka enye sia la, anye ne manɔ nenema o.
It’s a really interesting thing.	Enye nusi dzɔa dzi na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
They’re in your mind’s eye.	Wo le susu me na wò le susu me.
There is a road ahead of us.	Mɔ aɖe le mía ŋgɔ.
Why are you here?	Nukatae nèle afisia?
You just can’t do this kind of thing.	Ðeko màte ŋu awɔ nu sia ƒomevi o.
He would have wanted to do this, once.	Anye ne adi be yeawɔ esia, zi ɖeka.
Too many people.	Ame geɖe akpa.
I’ve seen things before.	Mekpɔ nuwo kpɔ.
It’s not possible.	Manya wɔ o.
Two for one.	Eve ɖe ɖeka.
It’s an ongoing process.	Enye ɖoɖo aɖe si le edzi yim.
Lots of stuff like that.	Nu geɖe siwo le abe ema ene.
If you can work on them, do it.	Ne àte ŋu awɔ dɔ tso wo ŋu la, ke wɔe.
Can't say what it is or where it is.	Mate ŋu agblɔ nusi wònye alo afisi wòle o.
So is everyone else.	Nenema ke ame sia ame hã le.
There is no one.	Ame aɖeke meli o.
Everyone raised their hand.	Amesiame do eƒe asi ɖe dzi.
There is no issue here.	Nya aɖeke mele afisia o.
He must be close to it.	Ele be wòate ɖe eŋu godoo.
That’s his job.	Emae nye eƒe dɔ.
Attack something really bad.	Dze nane si nye nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ dzi.
And for a good reason.	Eye susu nyui aɖe tae.
Everyone was surprised.	Ewɔ nuku na amesiame.
Someone had been expecting him.	Ame aɖe nɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ kpɔ.
Just great overall.	Ðeko wònye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ le bliboa me.
The king hurried away.	Fia la wɔ kaba dzo.
I was just so happy.	Ðeko mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
But things turned out well.	Gake nuwo va yi nyuie.
I just got sick.	Ðeko medze dɔ.
But only the downside.	Gake nusi gblẽ le eŋu koe.
In that way.	Le mɔ ma nu.
I was as surprised as anyone else.	Ewɔ nuku nam abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
His hard work ethic is a reason for this.	Eƒe dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ ƒe nɔnɔme nye susu aɖe si tae wòle alea ɖo.
Divide them into two parts.	Ma wo ɖe akpa eve me.
They’re all working just fine.	Wo katã wole dɔ wɔm nyuie ko.
Everything is going to be amazing.	Nusianu ava wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This is a bit of the same thing.	Esia nye nu ɖeka ma ke ƒe akpa aɖe vie.
Somewhere, there is another mountain, waiting.	Le afi aɖe la, to bubu aɖe li, le lalam.
It could have been night.	Ate ŋu anye zã hafi.
I want to talk about it.	Medi be magblɔ nu tso eŋu.
Something new is needed.	Nu yeye aɖe hiã.
Clearly, neither is he.	Edze ƒã be eya hã mele nenema o.
It was the state of his life.	Enye nɔnɔme si me wònɔ le eƒe agbe me.
I would like to know how to get along though.	Medi be manya alesi woawɔ ɖeka gake.
It will be here.	Anɔ afisia.
Or maybe not at all.	Alo ɖewohĩ menye nenema kura o.
But you can do it.	Gake àte ŋu awɔe.
That’s the only reason he’s here.	Ema koe nye susu si ta wòle afisia ɖo.
We don’t have anyone.	Ame aɖeke mele mía si o.
This situation is not new.	Nɔnɔme sia menye nu yeye o.
And something else.	Eye nu bubu hã.
Everything is so different there now.	Nusianu to vovo ale gbegbe le afima fifia.
But blood is important.	Gake ʋu le vevie.
He didn’t have that last year.	Ema menɔ esi le ƒe si va yi me o.
If that happens, we will fight.	Ne edzɔ alea la, míawɔ avu.
If he could tell her who he was.	Ne ate ŋu agblɔ amesi wònye nɛ.
This is very true.	Esia nye nyateƒe ŋutɔ.
It was another city.	Du bubu aɖee wònye.
Everything is working great.	Nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie ŋutɔ.
Why, we are so happy together.	Nukatae, míele dzidzɔ kpɔm ɖekae ale gbegbe.
They seem to be really going through it.	Edze abe wole eme tom ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
I can't.	Nyemate ŋui o.
We can all do it.	Mí katã míate ŋui.
No one has addressed that either.	Ame aɖeke hã mekpɔ ema gbɔ o.
There is no horse.	Sɔ aɖeke meli o.
Maybe that’s what works for you too.	Ðewohĩ emae nye nusi awɔ dɔ na wò hã.
Check out any of these items today!.	Kpɔ nu siawo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ɖa egbea!.
He must have had a tough week.	Kwasiɖa sesẽ aɖe anya nɔ esi.
I think this is a good idea.	Mesusu be esia nye susu nyui aɖe.
I will join you.	Mava wɔ ɖeka kpli wò.
But there is also a possibility.	Gake ate ŋu adzɔ hã li.
There is nothing more than that.	Naneke meli wu ema o.
There is nothing wrong with it.	Naneke mele eŋu o.
I was sorry for what he did.	Nusi wòwɔ la te ɖe dzinye.
I have several of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe le asinye.
Everyone lived happily ever after.	Amesiame nɔ agbe le dzidzɔ me.
I tried to move forward.	Medze agbagba be mayi ŋgɔ.
I decided to call someone.	Meɖoe be maƒo ka na ame aɖe.
I can’t help it.	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu o.
There has to be a better way.	Ele be mɔ si nyo wu nanɔ anyi.
And it is so, so much.	Eye ele ale gbegbe, ale gbegbe.
I'm sure these guys know about these things.	Meka ɖe edzi be ŋutsu siawo nya nu tso nu siawo ŋu.
Which is good for you and me.	Nukae anyo na mía kple wò.
In the end, it never happened.	Mlɔeba la, meva eme gbeɖe o.
Go there, say this, pretend to do that.	Yi afima, gblɔ nya sia, wɔ abe ɖe nèle nu ma wɔm ene.
One person moved out of my house.	Ame ɖeka ʋu le nye aƒe me.
I didn’t mean to do it.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔe o.
He never got to see any of them.	Mekpɔ mɔ kpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke kpɔ o.
Be the first to own it.	Nye ame gbãtɔ si tɔ wònye.
I can’t do that.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe nenema o.
We don’t have that here.	Ema mele mía si le afisia o.
It's going on a little bit.	Ele edzi yim vie.
So did I, too.	Nenema ke nye hã.
I had one job to do, one thing to focus on.	Dɔ ɖeka nɔ asinye mawɔ, nu ɖeka si ŋu nye susu nanɔ.
I obviously liked it.	Edze ƒã be nye nu lé dzi nam.
That’s good for him.	Ema nyo nɛ.
In fact, maybe they should do less.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ ele be woawɔ nu sue aɖe ko.
Only two of his books have survived.	Eƒe agbalẽ eve koe gakpɔtɔ li.
One could paraphrase this.	Ame aɖe ate ŋu agblɔ nya sia le mɔ bubu nu.
An idea came to me.	Susu aɖe va susu me nam.
Maybe it’s not there.	Ðewohĩ mele afima o.
A great one, too.	Gã aɖe hã.
Nothing came out.	Naneke medo go o.
It doesn’t make sense to me.	Susu mele eme nam o.
A man like that.	Ŋutsu si le abe ema ene.
It was a small town.	Du sue aɖee wònye.
That probably doesn’t surprise you.	Ðewohĩ ema mewɔ nuku na wò o.
This was too easy.	Esia nɔ bɔbɔe akpa.
Anyone else who gets ahead can step up.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe si doa ŋgɔ ate ŋu ado afɔ.
It was incredible, amazing.	Enye nusi mexɔ se o, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He doesn’t have a dog.	Avu aɖeke mele esi o.
That’s all there is to it.	Ema koe nye ema.
At the right time.	Le ɣeyiɣi si sɔ me.
I really don’t want to know.	Nyemedi ŋutɔŋutɔ be manya o.
It's as if he's ready to fight.	Ðeko wòle abe ɖe wòle klalo be yeawɔ avu ene.
Everything is going well on this side.	Nusianu le edzi yim nyuie le akpa sia.
One would certainly expect that.	Ame aɖe akpɔ mɔ nenema godoo.
And according to the law.	Eye le se nu la.
Like our.	Abe míaƒe...
I couldn’t do much with it.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nu boo aɖeke kplii o.
He needed the money.	Ehiã ga la.
But that’s one thing.	Gake ema nye ɖeka.
This is very simple.	Esia le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Not so much here, though.	Menye alea gbegbe le afisia o, gake.
Who did this?	Amekae wɔ esia?
And neither is he.	Eye menye eya hã o.
But he didn’t seem worried.	Gake edze abe metsi dzi o ene.
It was a pleasure working with you.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be mewɔ dɔ kpli wò.
We’re not like that here.	Míele nenema le afisia o.
I could feel it starting.	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me be edze egɔme.
Basically.	Kpuie ko.
This happened a lot.	Esia dzɔ ŋutɔ.
I would be happy to do so.	Adzɔ dzi nam be mawɔe nenema.
The matter will not always end there.	Nya la awu enu ɖe ​​afima ɣesiaɣi o.
No problem there either.	Kuxi aɖeke mele afima hã o.
They are in a hurry.	Wole du dzi.
It does look like four.	Edze abe ene ene nyateƒe.
One thing going to do another.	Nu ɖeka si le edzi yim be yeawɔ nu bubu.
I never knew which one.	Nyemenya wo dometɔ kae gbeɖe o.
I just ask myself.	Ðeko mebiaa ɖokuinye be.
I guess, give it some time.	Mesusu be, na ɣeyiɣi aɖee nɛ.
I think we will have some things to work on together.	Mesusu be nu aɖewo anɔ mía si míawɔ dɔ ɖekae le.
I liked that.	Edzɔ dzi nam nenema.
But it is still not the case.	Gake megale nenema kokoko o.
I don't understand.	Nye mese egɔme o.
They are in every city.	Wo le du ɖesiaɖe me.
I am just too tired right now.	Ðeko ɖeɖi te ŋunye akpa fifia.
It is a very simple matter.	Enye nya bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔ.
Speak up for him.	Ƒo nu ɖe ​​enu.
At least you have a job.	Dɔ aɖe le asiwò ya teti.
Too much of a situation.	Nɔnɔme si sɔ gbɔ akpa.
Probably a lot of things.	Ðewohĩ nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
You are more than enough.	Wòe nye ame si sɔ gbɔ wu.
It started somewhere, like everything else.	Edze egɔme tso afi aɖe, abe nu bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
But he really doesn’t know what he wants.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, menya nusi dim wòle o.
She didn't know he could talk to her like that.	Menya be ate ŋu aƒo nu na ye nenema o.
I can go on and on.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ nu ƒom.
Something is obviously going on.	Edze ƒã be nane le edzi yim.
Things could have turned out very differently.	Nuwo ate ŋu ava to vovo kura hafi.
I didn’t have any books.	Agbalẽ aɖeke menɔ asinye o.
It can happen today.	Ate ŋu adzɔ egbea.
There is a quality in his voice.	Nɔnɔme aɖe le eƒe gbe me.
But the end result will be the same.	Gake nu ɖeka ma ke ado tso eme mlɔeba.
Someone can save it.	Ame aɖe ate ŋu aɖee.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I want to work with you.	Medi be mawɔ dɔ kpli wò.
That was too easy.	Ema nɔ bɔbɔe akpa.
We had time to spare.	Ɣeyiɣi nɔ mía si.
I can’t remember the last time that happened.	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku zi mamlɛtɔ si nu ma dzɔ la dzi o.
But that’s still good news.	Gake nya nyui aɖe gakpɔtɔ nye ema.
In some ways, the opposite happened.	Le mɔ aɖewo nu la, nusi to vovo kura na ema dzɔ.
He hurried out into the night.	Ewɔ kaba do go yi zã me.
It wasn’t too late.	Metsi megbe akpa o.
I don’t have time to say more.	Ɣeyiɣi mele asinye magblɔ nya geɖe wu o.
Try a lot of things.	Te nu geɖe kpɔ.
I can’t help it.	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu o.
And that surprised me.	Eye esia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I heard the first thing one of them said.	Mese nya gbãtɔ si wo dometɔ aɖe gblɔ.
A little bit of it.	Vi aɖe vie.
Thank you so much!.	Akpe geɖe na wò!.
I knew someone knew what I was looking for.	Menya be ame aɖe nya nu si dim menɔ.
It all started here.	Nusianu dze egɔme le afisia.
Think big here.	Bu nu gã aɖe ŋu le afisia.
I'll go with you if you don't mind.	Mayi kpli wò ne meɖe fu na wò o.
I didn’t like this at all.	Esia medze ŋunye kura o.
Take your time with it.	Di wò ɣeyiɣi ɖe eŋu.
It’s not a difficult thing.	Menye nu sesẽ o.
He did two things.	Ewɔ nu eve.
But one thing is certain.	Gake dzi ɖo nu ɖeka dzi.
I need to seek help.	Ele be madi kpekpeɖeŋu.
He has many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe le esi.
Could we have done it.	Ðe míate ŋui.
He couldn't stand it, really.	Mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o, le nyateƒe me.
That is certainly possible.	Ema anya wɔ godoo.
That’s pretty normal.	Ema nye nusi sɔ nyuie.
I couldn’t do it.	Nyemete ŋu wɔe o.
No one knows where he is.	Ame aɖeke menya afi si wòle o.
Something bad would have happened by now.	Anye ne nu gbegblẽ aɖe adzɔ fifia hafi.
But stick to it.	Gake lé ɖe eŋu.
I promise you.	Medo ŋugbe na wò.
Nothing to do now.	Naneke meli woawɔ fifia o.
She was fine all morning.	Eƒe nɔnɔme nɔ nyuie ŋdi bliboa katã.
And one more thing.	Eye nu ɖeka bubu hã.
Why was he so unhappy?	Nukatae mekpɔ dzidzɔ alea gbegbe o?
Ultimately, it doesn’t matter.	Mlɔeba la, mehiã o.
You can’t stay here!	Màte ŋu anɔ afisia o!
It can’t be him.	Mate ŋu anye eya o.
That time has come.	Ɣeyiɣi ma ɖo.
I can’t remember ever feeling this way.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi be mese le ɖokuinye me alea kpɔ o.
I certainly did that for him for years.	Mewɔe nenema nɛ ƒe geɖe godoo.
Give them something to do.	Na nane wo woawɔ.
He wasn’t eating either.	Menɔ nu ɖum hã o.
There are too many people.	Amewo sɔ gbɔ akpa.
He was less than two years old.	Mexɔ ƒe eve teti o.
It’s not just the money.	Menye ga la koe wònye o.
He probably doesn’t know about you either.	Anɔ eme be eya hã menya nu tso ŋuwò o.
And he never worried.	Eye metsi dzi hã kpɔ o.
No one came out this way.	Ame aɖeke medo go le mɔ sia nu o.
We don’t have enough support.	Kpekpeɖeŋu si sɔ mele mía si o.
The dress is amazing.	Awu la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It’s really too much.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ akpa ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It could be a very long night.	Ate ŋu anye zã didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
Not while watching them from a house.	Menye esime wònɔ wo kpɔm tso aƒe aɖe me o.
He needs respect.	Ehiã bubu.
But you know what people are like.	Gake ènya alesi amewo le.
I need money.	Mehiã ga.
This is not necessarily a bad thing.	Esia menye nu gbegblẽ kokoko o.
I'm asking for water.	Mele tsi biam.
They are all very important.	Wo katã wole vevie ŋutɔ.
Two years have passed.	Ƒe eve va yi.
I can’t stay.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
He tried so hard.	Edze agbagba vevie ale gbegbe.
And we can’t find any either.	Eye míate ŋu ake ɖe ɖeke ŋu hã o.
I felt completely out of control.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nyemate ŋu aɖu ɖokuinye dzi kura o.
Actually do it this time.	Wɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ zi sia.
But if he had been there, he would not have been there.	Gake ne ɖe wònɔ afima la, anye ne manɔ anyi o.
I will need to warm myself up.	Ahiã be mado dzo na ɖokuinye.
Continue if this is bothering you.	Yi edzi nenye be esia le fu ɖem na wò.
In short, in short.	Kpuie kpuie.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
It was such a great thing.	Enye nu gã ma gbegbe.
Everything.	Nu sia nu.
There is absolutely no life in it.	Agbe aɖeke mele eme kura o.
He couldn’t speak at all.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu kura o.
Let me explain a little bit.	Maɖe eme vie.
He tried over and over again.	Edze agbagba zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
However, there was an issue.	Ke hã, nya aɖe nɔ anyi.
That made sense.	Susu nɔ nya ma me.
He seemed pleased with her face.	Edze abe eƒe mo dze eŋu ene.
That is a valid statement.	Nya ma sɔ.
Go further now.	Yi ŋgɔ wu fifia.
Finally, see what you want to see.	Mlɔeba la, kpɔ nu si nèdi be yeakpɔ la ɖa.
But what do you think?.	Gake nukae nèsusu?.
I asked who that was.	Mebia be amekae nye ema hã.
Increase your hand.	Dzi wò asi ɖe edzi.
I want to be in charge.	Medi be manɔ dɔa dzi kpɔm.
But this is not logically consistent.	Gake esia mewɔ ɖeka le susu me o.
All for one person.	Wo katã na ame ɖeka.
One thing that.	Nu ɖeka si.
And that’s your problem, not anyone else’s.	Eye emae nye wò kuxi, ke menye ame bubu aɖeke o.
I did a pretty good job.	Mewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
A lot has changed in my life.	Nu geɖe trɔ le nye agbe me.
I couldn’t stop anything.	Nyemete ŋu tɔ te naneke o.
This is a very good thing.	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
There are four seasons in a year.	Ɣeyiɣi ene ye le ƒe ɖeka me.
But no one answered.	Gake ame aɖeke meɖo eŋu o.
You are a good guy.	Ènye ŋutsu nyui aɖe.
You are such a great mind, you have done so much for me.	Ènye susu gã aɖe ale gbegbe, nèwɔ dɔ geɖe nam ŋutɔ.
Also.	Hã.
This law will actually kill people.	Se sia awu amewo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You too, man.	Wò hã, ŋutsu.
But he didn’t do the same.	Gake mewɔ nenema ke o.
I'm seeing someone tonight.	Mele ame aɖe kpɔm le zã sia me.
He had enough of it.	Eƒe nu sɔ gbɔ nɛ.
I'm getting angry.	Mele dziku dom.
But he can see you.	Gake ate ŋu akpɔ wò.
I asked them that.	Mebia wo be.
We are part of this city.	Míenye du sia ƒe akpa aɖe.
How much work will you do?	Dɔ nenie nàwɔ?
I have seen this.	Mekpɔ esia.
Just sit, sit, sit.	Nɔ anyi ko, nɔ anyi, nɔ anyi.
He usually does nothing.	Mewɔa naneke zi geɖe o.
There seem to be at least two.	Edze abe eve ya teti li ene.
We also lost our home.	Míaƒe aƒe hã bu na mí.
This is what we have.	Esia le mía si.
Small, but unlikely.	Sue, gake anɔ eme be manɔ eme o.
But it actually has the same problem.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, kuxi ma ke le eŋu.
In some cases.	Le go aɖewo me la.
He didn't really know what he was doing.	Menya nusi wɔm wònɔ tututu o.
He can actually do it.	Ate ŋui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He gave me one.	Etsɔ ɖeka nam.
Not for myself, not for anyone else.	Menye na ɖokuinye o, menye na ame bubu aɖeke o.
I’m not the only one.	Menye nye ɖeka ko o.
None of them worked.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ dɔ o.
This is no small task.	Esia menye dɔ sue aɖeke o.
That work begins today.	Dɔ ma dze egɔme egbea.
I understand your point.	Mese wò nya la gɔme.
I think this might help you.	Mesusu be esia ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
He did so much for them tonight.	Ewɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ na wo le zã sia me.
No concrete results.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke medo tso eme o.
Wear warm clothes.	Do awu siwo me dzo le.
You are everything to them.	Wòe nye nusianu na wo.
However, it is no longer the case.	Ke hã, megale nenema o.
I can take care of myself.	Mate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye dzi.
Not that it matters, really.	Menye ɖe wòle vevie o, le nyateƒe me.
You don’t know what you just did.	Mènya nusi nèwɔ teti koe nye ema o.
That’s what I want.	Emae nye nye didi.
That’s what it is.	Emae nye ema.
From.	Tso.
That can actually be a good thing.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema ate ŋu anye nu nyui aɖe.
But only to a certain extent.	Gake vaseɖe afi aɖe ko.
And you can tell me what happened.	Eye àte ŋu agblɔ nusi dzɔ la nam.
I can find something else to do.	Mate ŋu akpɔ nu bubu aɖe si mawɔ.
He is doing well.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie.
I just wanted to go.	Ðeko medi be mayi.
Please help me with this.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye le esia ŋu.
I tried to squeeze it all in here.	Medze agbagba be maƒo wo katã ɖe afisia.
Fill in the blanks.	Kpe nya siwo me susu mele o la dome.
The current still works.	Fifia la gakpɔtɔ le dɔ wɔm.
This is all we can do.	Esia koe nye nusi míate ŋu awɔ.
No one else can know that.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu anya nya ma o.
Keep your eye on it.	Wò ŋku nanɔ eŋu.
Some of them know from years ago.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nya nu tso ƒe aɖewo siwo va yi me.
In fact, this didn’t work out at all.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia medze edzi kura o.
But it is personal.	Gake enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
OH! 	O!
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
And a house, too.	Eye aƒe aɖe hã.
There should be nothing surprising about that.	Mele be naneke nawɔ nuku le ema ŋu o.
That’s a big deal.	Nya gã aɖee nye ema.
If only you had more money.	Ne ɖe ga geɖe wu le asiwò hafi.
When you eat, eat.	Ne èle nu ɖum la, ɖu nu.
Someone reminded me.	Ame aɖe ɖo ŋku edzi nam.
Expect this to take a few days.	Kpɔ mɔ be esia axɔ ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo.
But no one came through.	Gake ame aɖeke meva to eme o.
His reputation preceded him.	Eƒe ŋkɔ nyui do ŋgɔ nɛ.
And there are many of them.	Eye wo dometɔ geɖe le wo dome.
That is totally impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ kura o.
Way too late.	Mɔ si tsi megbe akpa.
You can do so much with it.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ kplii.
This didn’t work either.	Esia hã mewɔ dɔ o.
Tread lightly this way.	Ðe afɔ bɔbɔe le mɔ sia dzi.
Simple is better.	Nu bɔbɔe nyo wu.
And I’m sorry.	Eye meɖe kuku.
We have to do something.	Ele be míawɔ nane.
This is necessary for two reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae esia hiã ɖo.
Which is completely unlikely.	Nusi ate ŋu adzɔ kura o.
I had a pretty good life.	Agbe nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ asinye.
To do what is necessary rather than what is easy.	Be woawɔ nusi hiã tsɔ wu be woawɔ nusi le bɔbɔe.
Much more now.	Nu geɖe wu fifia.
A very nice person.	Ame nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I quickly confirmed.	Meɖo kpe edzi kaba.
He is looking for a better place.	Ele teƒe dim nyuie wu.
Are you.	Èle.
He had a tough week.	Kwasiɖa sesẽ aɖe nɔ esi.
But I certainly heard about it.	Gake mese nu tso eŋu godoo.
It’s been a long day.	Ŋkeke didi aɖee nye esia.
Make time for people.	Di ɣeyiɣi na amewo.
At the same time, it was a great year.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me la, ƒe gã aɖee wònye.
You’d better do the same.	Anyo be nàwɔ nenema ke.
I can’t do anything else.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
Every day is a different episode.	Ŋkeke ɖesiaɖe nye akpa aɖe si to vovo.
I was surprised, actually.	Ewɔ nuku nam, le nyateƒe me.
I have a question for you.	Mebia nya aɖe wò.
Maybe this rule works in some simple situations.	Ðewohĩ se sia wɔa dɔ le nɔnɔme bɔbɔe aɖewo me.
What is clear.	Nusi me kɔ.
It was his last job.	Enye eƒe dɔ mamlɛtɔ.
No one knows.	Ame aɖeke menya o.
He will save his life.	Aɖe eƒe agbe.
But only a little bit.	Gake sue aɖe koe.
However, it wasn’t easy.	Ke hã, menɔ bɔbɔe o.
It was my first job.	Enye nye dɔ gbãtɔ.
That’s just me.	Nye koe nye ema.
I’m not feeling well.	Nyemele nyuie o.
He can’t stand it.	Mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu o.
I understand this guy killed people.	Mese egɔme be ŋutsu sia wu amewo.
That’s what did it.	Emae wɔe.
And you are, too.	Eye wò hã nèle.
There were still some problems.	Kuxi aɖewo gakpɔtɔ nɔ anyi.
You can find it for me.	Àte ŋu ake ɖe eŋu nam.
I wondered which one shot me.	Mebia ɖokuinye be wo dometɔ kae da tu nye hã.
And I have my hair under control.	Eye nye ɖa le asinye le ɖokuinye dzi ɖum.
There is simply nothing to do.	Ðeko naneke meli woawɔ o.
Not a year or two.	Menye ƒe ɖeka alo eve o.
Busy, busy, busy today.	Vovo mele eŋu o, vovo mele eŋu o, vovo mele eŋu egbea o.
Not that this explains very much.	Menye ɖe esia ɖe nu geɖe me ŋutɔ o.
It’s a very interesting thing.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
I hope you can live with us.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu anɔ mía gbɔ le agbe.
Everyone is different.	Ame sia ame to vovo.
I hope it worked.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ewɔ dɔ.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
I no longer have this problem.	Kuxi sia megale ŋunye o.
Only some of us are like that.	Mía dometɔ aɖewo koe le nenema.
Once a week is enough.	Zi ɖeka le kwasiɖa me sɔ gbɔ.
This plan was widely supported.	Ame geɖe da asi ɖe ɖoɖo sia dzi.
I hope this was helpful.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia ɖe vi.
Nothing strange about it.	Naneke mewɔ nuku le eŋu o.
If we had more, that would be great.	Ne geɖe wu le mía si la, anyo ŋutɔ.
And that’s pretty good, too.	Eye ema hã nyo ŋutɔ.
We’re on the road.	Míele mɔ dzi.
And the logic is amazing.	Eye susu si le eme la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He needed them more than ever.	Ehiã wo wu tsã.
He was satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme.
so my heart is rejoicing.	ale gbegbe nye dzi le dzidzɔ kpɔm.
But it is very simple.	Gake ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
But this won’t work.	Gake esia mawɔ dɔ o.
You have to do the work for me.	Ele be nàwɔ dɔa nam.
It is a new law.	Enye se yeye aɖe.
I want to know, too.	Nye hã medi be manya.
There was something about him, something .	Nane nɔ eŋu, nane .
But they had reason.	Gake susu nɔ wo ŋu.
It is the complete opposite of the truth.	Enye nusi to vovo kura na nyateƒea.
You’re the one.	Wòe nye esia.
Where he was, there was reality.	Afisi wònɔ la, nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe nɔ anyi.
That’s exactly why.	Esia tututu tae.
The issue goes beyond that.	Nya la yi ŋgɔ wu ema.
But there are better things to do.	Gake nu siwo nyo wu li woawɔ.
My head keeps going up.	Nye ta nɔa dzi yim.
Stone is a hard material.	Kpe nye nu sesẽ aɖe.
But the opposite happened.	Gake nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ.
No one else can do the job.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ dɔa o.
Tomorrow, first thing.	Etsɔ, nu gbãtɔ.
I am the life.	Nyee nye agbe.
I don’t know how he can cope.	Nyemenya ale si wòate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu o.
This is a separate room.	Esia nye xɔ ɖeka si le eɖokui si.
I have a lot to do today.	Nu geɖe le asinye mawɔ egbea.
Live in the moment.	Nɔ agbe le ɣeyiɣi si me nèle la me.
Everything is a balance of course.	Nusianu nye nusi da sɔ ya.
It is necessary, of course.	Ehiã ya.
That’s the job.	Emae nye dɔa.
I heard this from them myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mese esia tso wo gbɔ.
I will take care of everything.	Makpɔ nusianu gbɔ.
There was something different in him now too, he didn't know what.	Nane si to vovo le eya hã me fifia, menya nusi o.
He has nothing to do here.	Naneke meli wòawɔ le afisia o.
It started last year some time.	Edze egɔme le ƒe si va yi me ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I have two houses.	Aƒe eve le asinye.
He had never seen anything quite like it.	Mekpɔ naneke si sɔ kple esia tututu kpɔ o.
He had no one else.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ esi o.
After that, it worked well.	Le ema megbe la, ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
He was obviously depressed.	Edze ƒã be nu te ɖe edzi.
Everyone was making money.	Amesiame nɔ ga kpɔm.
And you were alone.	Eye wò ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
It will be his job.	Anye eƒe dɔ.
This will require careful planning.	Esia ahiã be woawɔ ɖoɖo nyuie.
Me and him.	Mía kple eya.
I needed this today.	Mehiã esia egbea.
I just want her to have a better life.	Ðeko medi be agbe si nyo wu nanɔ esi.
This afternoon, maybe.	Ŋdɔ sia, ɖewohĩ.
This works well.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie.
What you have but don’t have.	Nusi le asiwò gake mele asiwò o.
That’s my job here in this place.	Emae nye nye dɔ le teƒe sia afisia.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ema menye nu gbegblẽ wɔwɔ o.
It seems simple but it is not.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe ene gake mele bɔbɔe o.
You are giving them this dress.	Èle awu sia nam wo.
There are a lot of people there now.	Ame geɖe le afima fifia.
There are two possible outcomes.	Nu eve aɖewo ate ŋu ado tso eme.
But he was too young to remember.	Gake metsi akpa be wòate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi o.
That was what he wanted most.	Emae nye nusi dim wònɔ wu.
I do so much for you.	Mewɔa nu geɖe ŋutɔ na wò.
I would have done anything for him.	Anye ne mewɔ nusianu nɛ hafi.
He had a head.	Ta nɔ eŋu.
He started sweating.	Edze fifia gɔme.
I have felt it before.	Mese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ.
Things are very strange.	Nuwo wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It’s not the right thing to do.	Menye nusi sɔ o.
He obviously didn’t tell her much about me.	Edze ƒã be megblɔ nya geɖe tso ŋunye nɛ o.
And it did happen.	Eye edzɔ nyateƒe.
Once in the room once.	Zi ɖeka le xɔa me zi ɖeka.
There is a good reason for it.	Susu nyui aɖe li si tae.
Now it’s his job.	Fifia eƒe dɔ.
I can meet you.	Mate ŋu ado go.
But I didn’t have my gun.	Gake nye tu la menɔ asinye o.
This is not in real time.	Esia menye le ɣeyiɣi ŋutɔŋutɔ me o.
I didn’t feel a bit old or tired.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be metsi alo ɖeɖi te ŋunye vie o.
I was glad to know his name.	Edzɔ dzi nam be menya eƒe ŋkɔ.
I don’t know what to tell you.	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ na wò o.
Very easy to operate.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ le eŋu.
There is no problem.	Kuxi aɖeke meli o.
All at the same time.	Wo katã le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
Everyone laughed at us.	Amesiame ko nu na mí.
Take a closer look.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie.
No one knows where you are.	Ame aɖeke menya afi si nèle o.
I have a house.	Aƒe aɖe le asinye.
I knew it would come.	Menya be ava.
One of us, now.	Mía dometɔ ɖeka, fifia.
I was there.	Menɔ afima.
Water waste is bad.	Tsi gbegblẽ nye nu gbegblẽ.
That would be great.	Ema anyo ŋutɔ.
Just like it used to be.	Abe alesi wònɔ tsã ene.
Your case is lost.	Wò nya la bu.
I think this will help a lot.	Mesusu be esia akpe ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ.
It’s a bad thing.	Enye nu gbegblẽ.
He wasn’t a good person either.	Menye ame nyui aɖeke hã o.
There is a lake near here.	Ta aɖe le afisia te ɖe afima ŋu.
I remember someone before saying one has to do something else.	Meɖo ŋku ame aɖe dzi hafi gblɔ be ele be ame nawɔ nu bubu aɖe.
He made a clear face.	Ewɔ mo si me kɔ nyuie.
I must have made a mistake somewhere.	Anɔ eme be mewɔ vodada aɖe le afi aɖe.
It will take too long.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
That’s what it is.	Emae nye ema.
This is a lie.	Esia nye alakpa.
I could know that much.	Mete ŋu nya nu geɖe ma.
It was so much fun eating.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be menɔ nu ɖum.
I need to call quickly.	Ele be maƒo ka kaba.
It’s something that needs to be done.	Enye nusi wòle be woawɔ.
Who will win this year?	Amekae aɖu dzi le ƒe sia me?
This sort of thing might appeal to some.	Ðewohĩ nu sia ƒomevi adzɔ dzi na ame aɖewo.
His, it doesn’t matter.	Eya tɔ, mehiã o.
You can stay as long as you want.	Àte ŋu anɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi si nèdi.
No one can help me.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye o.
This house is very expensive.	Aƒe sia xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Maybe that will happen this year.	Ðewohĩ ema adzɔ le ƒe sia me.
However, this is not a good idea.	Ke hã, esia menye susu nyui aɖeke o.
There was another person with him.	Ame bubu aɖe hã nɔ eŋu.
It will take much longer.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi wu kura.
That’s not on his mind.	Ema mele eƒe susu me o.
This is really quite simple.	Esia le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Which made me question myself.	Nusi na mebia nya ɖokuinye.
He was very attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
In many respects.	Le akpa geɖe me.
Right from the top.	Tso edzi tututu.
There is something for every age.	Nane li na ƒe ɖesiaɖe.
I just wonder what the reason is.	Ðeko mebiaa ɖokuinye be susu si tae wòle nenema ɖo hã.
I want to talk about them.	Medi be maƒo nu tso wo ŋu.
On many things.	Le nu geɖe ŋu.
He has his plan.	Eƒe ɖoɖo le esi.
He never asks how she is.	Mebiaa alesi wòle gbeɖe o.
It could be anything.	Ate ŋu anye nusianu.
If that were me, I would have done that.	Ne ɖe nyee nye ema la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
That is so true.	Ema nye nyateƒe ale gbegbe.
Clearly, this cannot be the case.	Edze ƒã be esia mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
That was just this morning.	Ŋdi sia koe nye ema.
You can get help faster than ever before.	Àte ŋu axɔ kpekpeɖeŋu kaba wu tsã.
That’s one thing.	Ema nye nu ɖeka.
They had a lot in common.	Nu geɖe nɔ wo dome si sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
I'll work on them tomorrow.	Mawɔ dɔ tso wo ŋu etsɔ.
He was focused on the outcome.	Nusi ado tso eme koe eƒe susu nɔ eŋu.
I never needed to know that.	Mehiã be manya nya ma gbeɖe o.
He wouldn’t allow it.	Maɖe mɔ ɖe eŋu o.
Someone who is very nice!.	Ame aɖe si nyo ŋutɔ!.
I don’t have to do it.	Mehiã be mawɔe o.
He focuses on his work.	Eƒe susu nɔa eƒe dɔa ŋu.
Just the exact location.	Teƒe si tututu wòle ko.
The past few weeks have been difficult for him.	Kwasiɖa ʋɛ siwo va yi la sesẽ nɛ.
That surprised him.	Ema wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
We’re here to stay.	Míele afisia.
Yet there was nothing there.	Ke hã naneke menɔ afima o.
He didn’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke menɔ esi o.
Just look, here you are.	Kpɔ ɖa ko, wòe nye esia.
Forget the money.	Ŋlɔ ga la be.
In some situations, a paradox arises.	Le nɔnɔme aɖewo me la, nya aɖe si tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu doa mo ɖa.
You can’t do that.	Màte ŋu awɔ ema o.
This is a real thing.	Esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Write reality right on top of reality.	Ŋlɔ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ɖe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ la dzi tututu.
I looked away, surprised and angry.	Meɖe ŋku ɖa, ewɔ nuku nam eye medo dziku.
He made a handshake.	Ewɔ asi kple asi.
He didn’t care enough.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme alesi dze o.
Stop the car!	Dzudzɔ ʋua!
The man between two cars.	Ŋutsu si le ʋu eve dome.
I expected too much.	Mekpɔ mɔ na nu geɖe akpa.
Tell your story.	Gblɔ wò nya la.
That can get complicated very quickly.	Ema ate ŋu ava sesẽ kaba ŋutɔ.
That makes no sense, please.	Susu aɖeke mele ema ŋu o, taflatse.
Something very strange happened.	Nu aɖe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ la dzɔ.
Everything had to be done for him.	Ele be woawɔ nusianu nɛ.
This has happened many times.	Esia dzɔ zi geɖe.
Couldn't have hoped for more.	Mate ŋu akpɔ mɔ na nu geɖe wu o.
Work with him.	Wɔ dɔ kplii.
I think he would love it.	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
Be careful!	Kpɔ nyuie!
Anything you want.	Nusianu si nèdi.
I can’t remember which one.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku esi dzi o.
None of them will be useful.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke maɖe vi o.
That worked well for him.	Ema wɔ dɔ nyuie nɛ.
But I knew this could be no chance.	Gake menya be esia mate ŋu anye mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke o.
None of them have any money.	Ga aɖeke mele wo dometɔ aɖeke si o.
I am working on that as well.	Mele dɔ wɔm tso ema hã ŋu.
Two things so simple.	Nu eve siwo le bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.

I couldn’t do it as well as he did.	Nyemete ŋu wɔe nyuie abe eya ene o.
Which is very new to me.	Nusi nye nu yeye ŋutɔ nam.
It’s a whole new thing.	Enye nu yeye kura.
People are very excited about it.	Amewo kpɔa dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ɖe eŋu.
We can prove it briefly on that basis.	Míate ŋu anɔ te ɖe nya ma dzi aɖo kpe edzi kpuie.
I don’t understand this.	Nyemese nya sia gɔme o.
Everyone here has done that.	Amesiame si le afisia wɔe nenema.
There was only one other chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ bubu ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
Make my mind easy’.	Na nye susu nanɔ bɔbɔe nam’.
It is important to be productive.	Ele vevie be nàwɔ dɔ nyuie.
A good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖe.
The house is small.	Aƒe le sue.
One more night.	Zã ɖeka bubu.

We hope you like it!.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò!.
Whatever.	Esi wònye ko.
Those who have already withdrawn.	Ame siwo ɖe eɖokui ɖa xoxo.
He couldn't finish things now.	Mete ŋu wu nuwo nu fifia o.
I have no money now.	Ga aɖeke mele asinye fifia o.
I understand it better now, just a little bit.	Mese egɔme nyuie wu fifia, vie ko.
No wonder why.	Mewɔ nuku o be nukatae.
Maybe it can work.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
I decided to do it.	Meɖoe be mawɔe.
I don’t know anything about it.	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o.
What about you?.	Wò nukae?.
You have to work for what you want.	Ele be nàwɔ dɔ ɖe nusi nèdi la ta.
But this part is different.	Gake akpa sia to vovo.
Dust accumulated in the room.	Ke ƒo ƒu ɖe xɔa me.
We are in this room.	Mí le xɔ sia me.
He wouldn’t tell me much else about it.	Magblɔ nya bubu geɖe nam tso eŋu o.
But the similarity ends right there.	Gake nusi ɖi wo nɔewo la wu enu le afima tututu.
I don’t know anything about this.	Nyemenya naneke tso esia ŋu o.
By any means necessary.	To mɔ ɖesiaɖe si hiã dzi.
He wasn't sure he could explain his longing.	Meka ɖe edzi be yeate ŋu aɖe yeƒe didi vevie la me o.
There’s a reason you don’t know my real name.	Susu aɖe li si tae mènya nye ŋkɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.

There is no word in this language for that.	Nya aɖeke mele gbe sia me na ema o.
I am very sorry for my role in his death.	Mete ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ le akpa si mewɔ le eƒe ku me ta.
He had only one job now.	Dɔ ɖeka koe nɔ esi fifia.
Who had done this to him.	Ame si wɔ nu sia ɖe eŋu kpɔ.
But they were obviously excited.	Gake edze ƒã be dzi dzɔ wo.
I was myself helping me.	Menye nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye kpe ɖe ŋunye.
But this is all he can tell them.	Gake esia koe nye nusi wòate ŋu agblɔ na wo.
But there is actually a good reason.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, susu nyui aɖe li.
I don’t know which one.	Nyemenya wo dometɔ kae o.
I’m happy for you.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe ŋuwò.
He can’t go on like this.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi alea o.
It’s very realistic.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
It has a good reputation.	Ŋkɔ nyui aɖe le eŋu.
The work began quickly.	Dɔa dze egɔme kaba.
You can wear them almost anytime.	Àte ŋu ado wo ɣesiaɣi kloe.
The water level in the lake is very low.	Tsi si le ta la me le sue ŋutɔ.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I know this is a bad time.	Menya be ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ aɖee nye esia.
But maybe it’s true.	Gake ɖewohĩ enye nyateƒe.
Just so we can go home.	Be míate ŋu ayi aƒeme ko.
But it will end soon.	Gake awu enu kpuie.
He started sweating.	Edze fifia gɔme.
Give us your word.	Na wò nya la mí.
There are so many houses.	Aƒe geɖe ŋutɔ le afima.
It’s already night.	Zã do xoxo.
Be careful of it.	Kpɔ nyuie le eŋu.
Which is the right thing to do.	Nukae nye nu si wòle be woawɔ.
Call us once in a while.	Ƒo ka na mí zi ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi aɖewo me.
The wind blew over him.	Ya la ƒo ɖe edzi.
There were some good results from the car.	Nu nyui aɖewo do tso ʋua me.
No one knows where he is.	Ame aɖeke menya afi si wòle o.
Some people are worried.	Ame aɖewo tsi dzi.
In life, of course.	Le agbe me la, le nyateƒe me.
But there’s an easier way, too.	Gake mɔ aɖe li si le bɔbɔe wu, hã.
He could not comply with this.	Mete ŋu wɔ ɖe esia dzi o.
So he did what he had to do.	Eya ta ewɔ nu si wòle be wòawɔ.
But these days.	Gake le ŋkeke siawo me.
I don't know how to prove this legally.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ aɖo kpe esia dzi le se nu o.
It was a pleasure to meet you.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò.
Time for me to go too.	Ɣeyiɣi si me nye hã mayi.
He couldn't look at her now.	Mete ŋu lé ŋku ɖe eŋu fifia o.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
He won’t do that.	Mawɔe nenema o.
Too many of them anyway.	Wo dometɔ geɖe akpa le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
To tell you the truth, it’s a little weird.	Ne magblɔ nyateƒea na wò la, ewɔ nuku vie.
Just that one time.	Ɣeyiɣi ɖeka ma koe.
So be thankful for what you have.	Eya ta da akpe ɖe nu si le asiwò ta.
But he wasn’t here.	Gake menɔ afisia o.
You must always tell the truth.	Ele be nàgblɔ nyateƒea ɣesiaɣi.
Indeed.	Le nyateƒe me.
This is different.	Esia to vovo.
Two problems, actually.	Kuxi eve, le nyateƒe me.
He obviously enjoys the job.	Edze ƒã be dɔa dzɔa dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
And in a way, there’s nothing new here.	Eye le mɔ aɖe nu la, nu yeye aɖeke mele afisia o.
I have something very similar to you.	Nane si ɖi wò ŋutɔ le asinye.
This represents the first result of its kind.	Esia tsi tre ɖi na nu gbãtɔ si do tso eme le eƒe ƒomevi me.
A system of thought.	Susu ƒe ɖoɖo aɖe.
I’ve never seen them like that.	Nyemekpɔ wo nenema kpɔ o.
I was like, for real.	Menɔ abe, le nyateƒe me ene.
That’s a very good thing.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ.
I hope we can get something running within a year.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be míate ŋu akpɔ nane si le du dzi le ƒe ɖeka me.
I don’t need to explain that much, maybe.	Mehiã be maɖe nu me nenema gbegbe o, ɖewohĩ.
Character can now speak.	Ame ƒe nɔnɔme ate ŋu aƒo nu azɔ.
This is exciting.	Esia do dzidzɔ na ame.
I worked my way through it.	Mewɔ dɔ le nye mɔ dzi to eme.
I didn’t know it was the last one.	Nyemenya be enye mamlɛtɔ o.
I can say that much.	Mate ŋu agblɔ nya ma gbegbe.
It worked well, too.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie hã.
Something else was at work.	Nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ dɔ wɔm.
It happened to all of us.	Edzɔ ɖe mí katã dzi.
It is very much.	Enye ŋutɔ.
What is the price of a new car?	Nukae nye ʋu yeye ƒe asi?
And its the last one.	Eye eƒe mamlɛtɔ.
Focus on the heart instead.	Tsɔ susu ɖo dzi teƒe.
It’s just not that simple.	Ðeko mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
He had his heart and mind.	Eƒe dzi kple susu nɔ eŋu.
I can’t say enough good things about it.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya nyui siwo sɔ tso eŋu o.
This really impressed me.	Esia wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
His mind suddenly cleared.	Eƒe susu me kɔ zi ɖeka.
In this one thing requires another.	Le esia me la, nu ɖeka bia be nu bubu nanɔ anyi.
People were strongly opposed.	Amewo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu sesĩe.
But no one else can do it.	Gake ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu awɔe o.
It could happen tomorrow.	Ate ŋu adzɔ etsɔ.
I thought it was amazing.	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I wondered how long he had been waiting for us.	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɣeyiɣi didi kae wònɔ mía lalam hã.
But it is no longer the case.	Gake megale nenema o.
It’s necessary.	Ehiã.
His car has seen better days.	Eƒe ʋua kpɔ ŋkeke siwo nyo wu.
He can’t make it inside.	Mate ŋu awɔe ɖe eme o.
Not overnight.	Menye zã aɖeke me o.
There is.	Nane le.
I think there were two elements to that.	Mesusu be nu eve aɖewo nɔ ema me.
But that wasn’t me.	Gake menye nyee nye ema o.
He is a character.	Enye ame aɖe si ƒe nɔnɔme.
I'm sorry about that, but there's a reason.	Meɖe kuku ɖe ema ta, gake susu aɖe li.
The snake ran away.	Da la ƒu du dzo.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
But no one will do it.	Gake ame aɖeke mawɔe o.
I work as a personal trainer.	Mewɔa dɔ abe ame ŋutɔ ƒe nufiala ene.
That this is different.	Be esia to vovo.
I was angry with myself for being too hard.	Medo dziku ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu le esi meva sesẽ akpa ta.
This process has a lot of work to do.	Dɔ geɖe le ɖoɖo sia ŋu.
Clearly, this is something we need to work on.	Edze ƒã be esia nye nusi me wòle be míawɔ dɔ le.
That surprised me a lot.	Ema wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
This house felt that way.	Aƒe sia se le eɖokui me nenema.
I am very happy now.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ fifia.
What could be more than that?	Nukae ate ŋu anɔ anyi wu ema?
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
What is so amazing about it? 	Nukae wɔ nuku le eŋu alea gbegbe?
Everyone said the same thing, backstage.	Amesiame gblɔ nya ɖeka ma ke, le megbe.
Which device didn’t matter.	Mɔ̃ kae menɔ vevie o.
And they have them.	Eye wole wo si.
I renounced everything.	Megbe nu le nusianu gbɔ.
I could actually see his face.	Mete ŋu kpɔa eƒe mo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You just can’t have bad food.	Ðeko màte ŋu akpɔ nuɖuɖu gbegblẽ o.
But you can’t come with us.	Gake màte ŋu ava kpli mí o.
But that didn’t work either.	Gake ema hã mewɔ dɔ o.

In a great way.	Le mɔ gã aɖe nu.
I was angry with him.	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu.
This can happen within a few hours to a few days.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ le gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo va ɖo ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo me.
I hope to see you soon.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ wò kpuie.
I can feed you plenty.	Mate ŋu ana nuɖuɖu wò geɖe.
This way, it’s not.	Mɔ sia dzi, menye nenema o.
I didn’t see this.	Nyemekpɔ esia o.
I'm sure of it.	Meka ɖe edzi.
This was never working.	Esia menɔ dɔ wɔm gbeɖe o.
Thank you.	Akpe na wò.
I was so ready.	Menɔ klalo ale gbegbe.
He did a very good job.	Ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Once last night, and now.	Zi ɖeka le zã si va yi me, eye fifia hã.
I know it happened somehow.	Menya be edzɔ le mɔ aɖe nu.
Please keep a few things in mind.	Taflatse na nu ʋɛ aɖewo nanɔ susu me na wò.
He never liked this teacher.	Nufiala sia medze eŋu gbeɖe o.
He didn’t know what he was doing.	Menya nusi wɔm wònɔ o.
The market closed in two hours.	Asi la tu le gaƒoƒo eve me.
This doesn’t work.	Esia mewɔa dɔ o.
It made sense.	Susu nɔ eme.
I was ready to do it.	Menɔ klalo be mawɔe.
He will see them through.	Akpɔ wo to eme.
Usually.	Zi geɖe.
I just told him that.	Ðeko megblɔ nya ma nɛ.
He had no idea what to do with them.	Eƒe nu menya nusi wòawɔ ɖe wo ŋu kura o.
Life lived upon life.	Agbe nɔ agbe ɖe agbe dzi.
It’s also a little weird.	Ewɔ nuku vie hã.
He may never be able to feel that way about anyone.	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu ase le eɖokui me nenema le ame aɖeke ŋu gbeɖe o.
He could not imagine what had happened to himself.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nusi dzɔ ɖe eɖokui dzi la le susu me o.
But this is quite different.	Gake esia to vovo kura.
Not necessarily good.	Menye nyui kokoko o.
But he didn’t see why that changed things.	Gake mekpɔ nusita ema trɔ nuwo o.
He liked his life very much.	Eƒe agbe dze eŋu ŋutɔ.
Stay as long as you want.	Nɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi si nèdi.
But there are two exceptions.	Gake nu eve aɖewo li siwo to vovo na ema.
That would be great.	Ema anyo ŋutɔ.
This day was too much for him.	Ŋkeke sia sɔ gbɔ nɛ akpa.
Exactly.	Tututu.
It seems like.	Edze abe.
At this point, he couldn’t stand a chance.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke nu o.
Will this work?.	Ðe esia awɔ dɔa?.
But they need to act quickly.	Gake ele be woawɔ nu kaba.
But you are very normal.	Gake wòe nye ame si sɔ ŋutɔ.
Decide what you think is important.	Tso nya me le nusi nèsusu be ele vevie ŋu.
Just like here.	Abe ale si ko le afisia ene.
Everything is expensive now.	Nusianu xɔ asi fifia.
You may not be able to.	Ðewohĩ màte ŋui o.
But he didn’t say anything.	Gake megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I have to go now.	Ele be mayi fifia.
It’s nothing of the sort.	Menye naneke si ƒomevi wònye o.
He doesn’t have to make himself.	Mehiã be wòawɔ eɖokui o.
But tell you what to do.	Gake gblɔ nusi nàwɔ na wò.
No one is that precious.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ asi nenema o.
That makes no sense.	Susu aɖeke mele nya ma ŋu o.
No one said much.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya geɖe o.
Everyone was very excited about this.	Dzi dzɔ amesiame ŋutɔ ɖe esia ŋu.
But something has to happen somewhere.	Gake ele be nane nawɔ le afi aɖe.
He had this one.	Esia nɔ esi.
Death in the car.	Ku le ʋua me.
There was no room at all.	Xɔ aɖeke kura menɔ afima o.
I can’t see how he could have lived.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi wòate ŋu anɔ agbe hafi o.
But it doesn’t matter now.	Gake mehiã fifia o.
There is definitely a lot to do here.	Nu geɖe li woawɔ le afisia godoo.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
There is nothing he can do to me.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ ɖe ŋunye o.
He sang loudly.	Edzi ha sesĩe.
I’m the one!	Nyee nye esia!
There seems to be.	Edze abe ɖe li ene.
Treat them kindly.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu nyuie.
It was most incredible.	Enye nusi mexɔ se o wu.
In a reasonable way.	Le mɔ aɖe si sɔ nu.
It cannot be working today.	Mate ŋu anɔ dɔ wɔm egbea o.
He put his hand on his head.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ɖo eƒe ta dzi.
He suddenly fell backwards.	Edze anyi ɖe megbe zi ɖeka.
I tried to protect them.	Medze agbagba be makpɔ wo ta.
But that everything is nothing.	Gake be nusianu menye naneke o.
But he can do it with the money.	Gake ate ŋu awɔe kple ga la.
But bear with me.	Gake do dzi nam.
But he had a point.	Gake nya aɖe nɔ esi.
There is a reason for it.	Susu aɖe li si tae.
It’s a fascinating thing.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame.
Way too late.	Mɔ si tsi megbe akpa.
What is the right thing to do?	Nukae wòle be woawɔ?
Point you right here, and.	Fia asi wò le afisia tututu, eye.
Listen to it!	Lé to ɖe eŋu!
I had never heard of this technique.	Nyemese aɖaŋu sia ŋu nya kpɔ o.
Today he did something he had never done before.	Egbea ewɔ nane si mewɔ kpɔ o.
Actually, I was really worried about that.	Le nyateƒe me la, metsi dzi ɖe ema ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I was furious.	Medo dziku vevie.
That really impressed me.	Ema wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
That time is over.	Ɣeyiɣi ma nu yi.
In recent years, that has changed.	Le ƒe ʋɛ siwo va yi me la, ema trɔ.
It was someone else.	Ame bubu aɖee.
He leaned against a rock.	Etsɔ eɖokui ɖo kpe aɖe dzi.
Continue!	Yi edzi!
This is no small matter.	Esia menye nya sue aɖeke o.
That is very difficult to do.	Ema wɔwɔ sesẽ ŋutɔ.
The price is well worth it.	Ga la sɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
People have to be on it.	Ele be amewo nanɔ edzi.
Some others may make more detailed assumptions.	Ame bubu aɖewo ate ŋu awɔ susu siwo me kɔ wu.
I can’t do it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe o.
I hope you are all right.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be èle nyuie.
Logically, this would be true.	Susu le eme be esia anye nyateƒe.
It just didn’t work.	Ðeko meɖe vi aɖeke o.
You mentioned my name.	Ègblɔ nye ŋkɔ.
I couldn’t stop thinking about it.	Nyemete ŋu dzudzɔ eŋu bubu o.
Everything takes time.	Nusianu bia ɣeyiɣi.
He is doing well.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie.
And that won’t be easy.	Eye ema manɔ bɔbɔe o.
All these kinds of things.	Nu siawo ƒomevi katã.
I'm going.	Medo go.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
And he was so tired.	Eye ɖeɖi te eŋu ale gbegbe.
It's if that.	Enye nenye be.
It will make everything so much easier.	Ana nusianu nanɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
All of this seems impossible to me.	Edze nam abe nya siawo katã mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.
I don’t need to explain myself.	Mehiã be maɖe ɖokuinye me o.
I’m not positive, but it’s four things.	Menye susu nyui le ŋunye o, gake enye nu ene.
Now, the real work begins.	Fifia, dɔa ŋutɔŋutɔ dze egɔme.
Pray, listen to him.	Do gbe ɖa, lé to ɖe eŋu.
As it might be.	Abe alesi wòate ŋu anɔ ene.
I had to fight that.	Ele nam be mawɔ avu kple ema.
People passed by.	Amewo to afima.
Which is little more than nothing.	Nusi nye nu sue aɖe ko wu naneke o.
At least make some money out of it.	Wɔ ga aɖe tso eme ya teti.
I am in a great mood.	Mele nɔnɔme gã aɖe me.
I have to get out.	Ele be mado go.
He was a good guy.	Ame nyui aɖee wònye.
But this has passed.	Gake esia va yi.
This is a new thing.	Esia nye nu yeye.
I think there are still a few survivors.	Mesusu be ame ʋɛ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ li siwo tsi agbe.
It could not have been better.	Mate ŋu anyo wu ema hafi o.
This is very necessary.	Esia hiã ŋutɔ.
There was a lot of old money here.	Ga xoxo geɖe nɔ afisia.
We don’t know you.	Míenya wò o.
No one seemed to care much.	Edze abe ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme boo o ene.
I am sure you know these things.	Meka ɖe edzi be ènya nu siawo.
That would be a great thing.	Ema anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
To this day, of course.	Vaseɖe egbea ya.
That person laughed.	Ame ma ko nu.
There is no water at the lake.	Tsi aɖeke mele ta la gbɔ o.
Too many big projects at once is hard.	Dɔ gã geɖe wɔwɔ zi ɖeka sesẽ.
He will be ready to go.	Anɔ klalo be yeayi.
The issue is very important.	Nya la le vevie ŋutɔ.
He hasn’t said enough yet.	Megblɔ nya si sɔ gbɔ haɖe o.
Now be very careful.	Azɔ kpɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t answer.	Mete ŋu ɖo eŋu o.
He treated her like a child.	Ewɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu abe ɖevi ene.
If you have any questions about this, please contact her.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò ku ɖe esia ŋu la, taflatse te ɖe eŋu.
But it’s not here yet.	Gake mele afisia haɖe o.
It would be a great loss.	Anye nu gã aɖe si bu.
It’s his character.	Enye eƒe nɔnɔme.
He couldn’t imagine anything better.	Mete ŋu kpɔ naneke si nyo wu ema le susu me o.
I don’t really understand why you would do that.	Nyemese nusita nàwɔ nenema gɔme tututu o.
My name is also different.	Nye ŋkɔ hã to vovo.
I have a lot of books.	Agbalẽ geɖe le asinye.
But that’s a good idea.	Gake susu nyui aɖee nye ema.
In a small room.	Le xɔ sue aɖe me.
This room gave me life.	Xɔ sia na agbe nam.
But he had nothing.	Gake nu aɖeke menɔ esi o.
Simple following reasons.	Susu siwo gbɔna bɔbɔe.
I can work with that.	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ kple ema.
This could be a week or two.	Esia ate ŋu anye kwasiɖa ɖeka alo eve.

Nenema is.	Nenema ke.
Grain prices have risen sharply.	Nuku ƒe asi dzi ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.

He doesn’t do anything on his own.	Mewɔa naneke le eɖokui si o.
This is the only one.	Esia koe nye ɖeka.

He offered a hand to the incredible car.	Etsɔ asi aɖe na ʋu si mexɔ se o la.
He was the only one in no hurry.	Eya ɖeka koe mewɔ kaba o.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I like this place.	Teƒe sia dzɔa dzi nam.
He didn’t care about me.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam o.
No one said anything to him.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke nɛ o.
And this is one of them.	Eye esia nye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
It looks better to me too.	Edze nam nyuie wu nam hã.
These guys are just getting started.	Ðeko ŋutsu siawo le egɔme dzem.
There are many problems with this.	Kuxi geɖe le esia ŋu.
I don’t think that works for them.	Nyemesusu be ema mewɔa dɔ na wo o.
There is no one about.	Ame aɖeke meli ku ɖe.
But he needs you.	Gake ehiã wò.
You know where everything is.	Ènya afisi nusianu le.
Everyone was sober.	Amesiame ƒe susu nɔ nu ŋu nyuie.
It was a wonderful time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Often, loss of employment.	Zi geɖe la, dɔ ge le ame si.

He couldn't get too close.	Mete ŋu te ɖe eŋu akpa o.
He will find it soon.	Ake ɖe eŋu kpuie.
Everything must be in its own way.	Ele be nusianu nanɔ eƒe mɔ nu.
That’s what makes this different.	Emae nye nusi na esia to vovo.
Speak for an hour.	Ƒo nu gaƒoƒo ɖeka.
Nice to meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò.
You are making a mistake.	Èle vodada aɖe wɔm.
This will be done in two ways.	Woawɔ esia le mɔ eve nu.
No one has ever reached this level.	Ame aɖeke meɖo nɔnɔme sia gbɔ kpɔ o.
I don’t need it.	Mehiã nam o.
Search the crowded room.	Di xɔ si me amewo sɔ gbɔ ɖo la me.
And it doesn’t look like it’s going to get any better anytime soon.	Eye edze abe mava nyo ɖe edzi kpuie o ene.
I don’t know if we can win.	Nyemenya nenye be míate ŋu aɖu dzi o.
But some others don’t know much about it.	Gake ame bubu aɖewo menya nu tso eŋu tututu o.
And you can’t do anything with it.	Eye màte ŋu awɔ naneke kple esia o.
I have no time for myself.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke mele asinye na ɖokuinye o.
They have no money at all.	Ga ƒomevi aɖeke kura mele wo si o.
Tell them what happened.	Gblɔ nusi dzɔ la na wo.
I can live without it.	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe ema manɔmee.
More people are working.	Ame geɖe wu le dɔ wɔm.
For now, at least, it worked.	Fifia ya teti la, ewɔ dɔ.
Doing what you want.	Nusi nèdi wɔwɔ.
We are not progressing in that order.	Míele ŋgɔ yim le ɖoɖo ma nu o.
He had never been there.	Menɔ afima kpɔ o.
If you think you have what it takes.	Ne èsusu be nusi hiã la le ye si.

A new bill will be passed next month.	Woawɔ se yeye aɖe le ɣleti si gbɔna me.
It just isn’t in it.	Ðeko mele eme o.
Do whatever you have to do.	Wɔ nusianu si wòle be nàwɔ.
But there’s something there that he reacted to.	Gake nane le afima si ŋu wòwɔ nu ɖo.
There is only one downside.	Nu gbegblẽ ɖeka koe le eŋu.
Since there is no time.	Esi ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli o ta.
Like, all of them.	Abe, wo katã ene.
It is very important to them.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ na wo.
The job requires some skill	Dɔa bia aɖaŋu aɖewo
He had a full day of work ahead of him.	Dɔ ŋkeke bliboa nɔ ŋgɔ nɛ.
All we have so far is a name.	Nusi le mía si vaseɖe fifia koe nye ŋkɔ.

But there was nothing in it.	Gake nya aɖeke menɔ eme o.
I hope that’s not you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be menye wòe nye ema o.

Every book is different.	Agbalẽ ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
Yet he could not set it in place.	Ke hã mete ŋu ɖoe ɖe teƒe o.
Smoke came out of at least one place, now.	Dzudzɔ do tso teƒe ɖeka ya teti, fifia.
It’s important to me.	Ele vevie nam.
But in a different way.	Gake le mɔ bubu nu.
Also, he has a point.	Azɔ hã, nya aɖe le esi.
I’m not going to do that.	Nyemele ewɔ ge nenema o.
But something is very wrong.	Gake nane gblẽ ŋutɔ.
It’s a pretty big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I am so glad I have it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be ele asinye.
A great deal, actually.	Nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
Be very careful.	Kpɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
Think of something that will work.	Bu nane si awɔ dɔ ŋu.
I'm going to need it.	Mele ehiã ge.
Looks like the little guy is still kicking.	Edze abe ŋutsu sue la gakpɔtɔ le afɔ ƒom ene.
I can remember when that song came out.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku ɣeyiɣi si me ha ma do la dzi.
I haven’t heard from them.	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso wo gbɔ o.
I hope the low people are right.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ame siwo le bɔbɔe la ƒe nya sɔ.
It can’t be any other way.	Mate ŋu anye le mɔ bubu nu o.
I don’t know exactly how to tell you this.	Nyemenya ale si tututu magblɔ nya sia na mi o.
We hope you can join us!.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu awɔ ɖeka kpli mí!.
He obviously wouldn’t.	Edze ƒã be mawɔe nenema o.
I'm trying for that.	Mele agbagba dzem ɖe ema ta.
However, this is not the case at all.	Ke hã, esia mele alea kura o.
I couldn’t find anything.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe naneke ŋu o.
I wonder what you think of it.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae nèsusu tso eŋu hã.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
We seem to have a lot in common.	Edze abe nu geɖe le mía dome ene.
I am angry with you.	Medo dziku ɖe ŋuwò.
It might take a little while.	Ðewohĩ axɔ ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe.
I didn’t touch anything.	Nyemeka asi naneke ŋu o.
Which he doesn’t want to do, not yet.	Nusi medi be yeawɔ o, menye haɖe o.
Not too much water.	Menye tsi si sɔ gbɔ akpa o.
Write a lot of things.	Ŋlɔ nu geɖe.
Nothing has ever done it.	Naneke mewɔe kpɔ o.
No one is in such a hurry.	Ame aɖeke mele du dzi nenema gbegbe o.
People will kill for them.	Amewo awu ame ɖe wo ta.
Thank you thank you thank you!.	Akpe na wò akpe na wò akpe na wò!.
Meet with them.	Do go kpli wo.
All that matters is the here and now.	Nusi le vevie koe nye afisia kple fifia.
You.	Wò.
Things get interesting here.	Nuwo va doa dzidzɔ na ame le afisia.
It seems a little strange now.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku vie fifia ene.
It was just past four o'clock.	Ga ene wu enu teti koe nye ema.
And yet death has come to this place.	Eye ke hã ku va ɖo teƒe sia.
But he had made mistakes before.	Gake ewɔ vodada tsã.
It was a great time.	Menye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe.
Things are bad there.	Nuwo gblẽ le afima.
This was very difficult for me to do.	Esia wɔwɔ sesẽ nam ŋutɔ.
But it is working well for me.	Gake ele dɔ wɔm nyuie nam.
But he tried to focus on something simple.	Gake edze agbagba be yeƒe susu nanɔ nu bɔbɔe aɖe ŋu.
I wonder how many survived.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ame nenie tsi agbe hã.
The project will last until next year.	Dɔa anɔ anyi vaseɖe ƒe si gbɔna me.
This was very difficult for me.	Esia sesẽ nam ŋutɔ.
Honestly, my life was ruined in a week.	Le nyateƒe me la, nye agbe gblẽ le kwasiɖa ɖeka me.
We are running fast.	Míele du dzi sesĩe.
I couldn’t relax.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe dzi ɖi o.
He was one of them, too.	Eya hã nye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
And maybe a lot more.	Eye ɖewohĩ nu geɖe wu hã.
Look at the car.	Kpɔ ʋua.
But of course, no one did.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
He never forgave himself for his death.	Metsɔ eƒe ku ke eɖokui kpɔ o.
It will be fine now.	Anɔ nyuie fifia.
Which is coming soon.	Nusi ava kpuie.
It’s like we never have a problem.	Ðeko wòle abe ɖe kuxi aɖeke mele mía ŋu gbeɖe o ene.
I finally found some time to do it.	Meva kpɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe tsɔ wɔe mlɔeba.
I saw what he could do.	Mekpɔ nusi wòate ŋu awɔ.
I am looking for a way.	Mele mɔ aɖe dim.
The car arrived an hour late.	Ʋua va ɖo gaƒoƒo ɖeka megbe.
That’s really my whole point.	Emae nye nye nya bliboa ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s more than any man needs.	Ema sɔ gbɔ wu esi ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe hiã.
There is no one in sight.	Ame aɖeke mele ŋku dzi o.
I’m so glad to be here with you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mele afisia kpli wò.
Probably less.	Ðewohĩ anɔ ʋɛ wu.
I understood it perfectly.	Mese egɔme nyuie.
That would be a trap though.	Ema anye mɔ̃ gake.
Its that simple.	Eƒe bɔbɔe nenema.
I can’t live normally.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe le mɔ si sɔ nu o.
Without head and feet.	Ta kple afɔ manɔmee.
Quite a few of them, in fact.	Le nyateƒe me la, wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ.
He will understand that.	Ase nya ma gɔme.
But it’s been four years and nothing has come of it.	Gake ƒe ene enye sia eye naneke medo tso eme o.
You seem to be in a hurry.	Edze abe èle du dzi ene.
That was never different.	Menye ema to vovo gbeɖe o.
I've survived this kind of thing.	Metsi agbe le nu sia ƒomevi me kpɔ.
Four thousand people came.	Ame akpe ene ye va.
Very nice guy to work with.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
We’re not there.	Míele afima o.
Everyone else has an idea.	Susu aɖe le ame bubu ɖesiaɖe si.
Many people attended the meeting.	Ame geɖe va kpekpea.
I actually had a problem with this.	Kuxi aɖe nɔ ŋunye le esia ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
His heart was busy.	Eƒe dzi nɔ dɔ dzi vevie.
You know it’s true.	Ènya be enye nyateƒe.
Almost here, please.	Afisia kloe, meɖe kuku.
It has many other functions.	Dɔ bubu geɖe le eŋu.
Treat them that way.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu nenema.
But there is one problem.	Gake kuxi ɖeka aɖe li.
Nothing offended him.	Naneke medo dziku nɛ o.
Let him try it.	Na wòate kpɔ.
There wasn’t much to it, but there was something.	Nu geɖe menɔ eme o, gake nane nɔ eme.
What is the issue.	Nukae nye nya la.
Well done.	Ewɔ nyuie.
It will take him a long time to get over this.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi hafi wòate ŋu aɖu esia dzi.
What is easy for them may not be so easy for us.	Ðewohĩ nusi le bɔbɔe na wo la manɔ bɔbɔe na mí nenema o.
After a while the dog came home.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe la, avu la trɔ gbɔ va aƒeme.
I saw you in real life.	Mekpɔ wò le agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ me.
And no one said anything.	Eye ame aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I don’t think I could be making much money doing this.	Nyemesusu be mate ŋu anɔ ga geɖe kpɔm tso esia wɔwɔ me o.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
I don’t know how to tell you what happened.	Nyemenya ale si magblɔ nu si dzɔ la na mi o.
It’s consistent with everything else.	Ewɔ ɖeka kple nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
Change things in order.	Trɔ nuwo ɖe ɖoɖo nu.
In contrast, every book is different.	To vovo na ema la, agbalẽ ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
No one should be here.	Mele be ame aɖeke nanɔ afisia o.
He can’t go on like this.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi alea o.
The wind was at his back.	Ya la nɔ eƒe megbe.
There are also a few one-room apartments.	Xɔ ɖeka me xɔ ʋɛ aɖewo hã le eme.
It usually has one teacher, usually two.	Zi geɖe la, nufiala ɖeka nɔa eme, eye zi geɖe la, eve nɔa eme.
A car hit me.	Ʋu aɖe va dze dzinye.
People to fight it or join them.	Amewo be woawɔ avu kplii alo awɔ ɖeka kpli wo.
I didn’t know what to do at all.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ kura o.
But the teacher was more interested.	Gake nufiala la tsɔ ɖe le eme wu.
In fact, this part about them is already outdated.	Le nyateƒe me la, akpa sia si ku ɖe wo ŋu la do xoxo xoxo.
For how long.	Ɣeyiɣi didi kae.
It was a really helpful book.	Enye agbalẽ si kpe ɖe ame ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t think it will last a week.	Nyemesusu be anɔ anyi kwasiɖa ɖeka o.
I can meet you.	Mate ŋu ado go.
I do this about twice a week.	Mewɔa esia abe zi eve le kwasiɖa me ene.
You can contact them by.	Àte ŋu aƒo ka na wo to...
That would be a big deal.	Ema anye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I would do anything for them.	Mawɔ nusianu na wo.
And that was very useful for me.	Eye ema ɖe vi nam ŋutɔ.
But this is not true at all.	Gake esia ya menye nyateƒe kura o.
Use common sense.	Zã susu nyui.
In fact, he seemed almost satisfied.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme kloe ene.
Maybe you’ll be interested.	Ðewohĩ adzɔ dzi na wò.
Please stay where you are.	Taflatse nɔ afisi nèle.
I told him no way.	Megblɔ nɛ be mɔ aɖeke dzi o.
He wasn’t in school today.	Menɔ suku egbea o.
No one ever really does.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa esia ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
I was in his mind.	Menɔ eƒe susu me.
I have seen this.	Mekpɔ esia.
That’s a real problem.	Ema nye kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Follow it carefully.	Wɔ ɖe edzi nyuie.
No one was talking.	Ame aɖeke menɔ nu ƒom o.
Maybe he’s the only one.	Ðewohĩ eya ɖeka koe.
Our baby is at an impressionable age now.	Mía vi la le ƒe si wɔa dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ me fifia.
I'll keep scratching my neck with that.	Mayi edzi anɔ nye kɔ ƒom kple ema.
Now, get out of my way.	Azɔ, do le nye mɔ dzi.
No one has done that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ nu ma o.
This may take some time.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
In fact, things could get more complicated.	Le nyateƒe me la, nuwo ate ŋu ava sesẽ ɖe edzi.
Otherwise, a great book.	Ne menye nenema o la, agbalẽ gã aɖe.
And we are in a hurry.	Eye míele du dzi.
And everyone knows what that can lead to.	Eye ame sia ame nya nusi ema ate ŋu ado tso eme.
Things seem to be normal.	Edze abe nuwo sɔ ene.
He was satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme.
Sign up today.	De asi agbalẽ te egbea.
I am on my way now.	Mele mɔ dzi fifia.
And now here it is.	Eye fifia le afisia.
No one can take that away from you.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ ema le asiwò o.
Water is important, but not as important as food.	Tsi le vevie, gake mele vevie abe nuɖuɖu ene o.
Everyone is too polite.	Amesiame nye ame si ŋu bubu le akpa.
I don’t want to be here.	Nyemedi be manɔ afisia o.
This is four years.	Esia nye ƒe ene.
Good news though.	Nya nyui aɖee wònye gake.
But he didn’t know.	Gake menya o.
He was the only one who spoke like that.	Eya koe ƒo nu alea.
But we are talking now.	Gake míele nu ƒom fifia.
I believe in an eye for an eye.	Mexɔ ŋku ɖe ŋku teƒe dzi se.
You can do this thing.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu sia.
I know about this.	Menya nu tso esia ŋu.
The first part of this took about an hour.	Esia ƒe akpa gbãtɔ xɔ abe gaƒoƒo ɖeka ene.
And something else.	Eye nu bubu aɖe hã.
Nobody wants that!.	Ame aɖeke medi nenema o!.
By making them completely wrong.	To wo wɔwɔ nu gbegblẽ kura me.
I didn’t feel it.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me o.
The wind seemed to die suddenly.	Edze abe ya la ku zi ɖeka ene.
Is.	Enye.
No one knows.	Ame aɖeke menya o.
The landscape of this mountain is very interesting.	To sia ƒe nɔnɔme doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
Some of his ideas are really good.	Eƒe susu aɖewo nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But it’s starting now.	Gake edze egɔme fifia.
You are in a very different way.	Èle mɔ bubu nu ŋutɔ.
What a first day.	Ŋkeke gbãtɔ kae nye si.
That doesn’t make sense either.	Susu mele nya ma hã me o.
You still have the same problem.	Kuxi ma ke gakpɔtɔ le fu ɖem na wò.
That is obviously a must.	Edze ƒã be ema nye nusi wòle be woawɔ.
And he couldn’t see.	Eye mete ŋu kpɔ nu o.
Come out and see me.	Do go va kpɔm.
Little did he know himself.	Nu sue aɖe koe eya ŋutɔ menya o.
It happened too easily.	Edzɔ bɔbɔe akpa.
I met them.	Medo go wo.
I do this very well.	Mewɔa esia nyuie ŋutɔ.
But it was weird in a good way.	Gake ewɔ nuku le mɔ nyui aɖe nu.
That’s usually pretty good.	Zi geɖe la, ema nyo ŋutɔ.
He's always trying to have the last word.	Ele agbagba dzem ɣesiaɣi be nya mamlɛtɔ nanɔ ye si.
It never worked at all.	Mewɔ dɔ kura gbeɖe o.
Great location and great deal.	Teƒe nyui aɖe eye wònye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
That made it easier for them.	Ema na wònɔ bɔbɔe na wo.
Everybody who was everybody was there.	Ame sia ame si nye ame sia ame la nɔ afima.
Again, these two conditions are the same.	Le afisia hã la, nɔnɔme eve siawo sɔ.
No one else had ever been in it.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ eme kpɔ o.
I am looking forward to this new opportunity.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie na mɔnukpɔkpɔ yeye sia.
Now, it is very much so.	Fifia, ele nenema ŋutɔ.
I want to keep going.	Medi be mayi edzi.
He said nothing more.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke wu ema o.
In fact, you want the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae nèdi.
His mind wasn’t working properly.	Eƒe susu menɔ dɔ wɔm nyuie o.
Now you can see exactly what you want to see.	Fifia àte ŋu akpɔ nu si tututu nèdi be yeakpɔ.
And he couldn’t see anything.	Eye mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
We all have something in common.	Nane sɔ kple mí katã.
About a high-performance dog.	Le avu si wɔa dɔ nyuie ŋu.
In fact, you may be able to answer that question.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ àte ŋu aɖo nya sia ŋu.
There was never an issue.	Nya aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
Watch out for it soon.	Kpɔ nyuie le eŋu kpuie.
What happened happened.	Nusi dzɔ la dzɔ.
He never saw a gun here.	Mekpɔ tu le afisia kpɔ o.
That is our job.	Emae nye míaƒe dɔ.
However, the police have yet to act.	Ke hã, kpovitɔwo mewɔ naneke haɖe o.
This is relatively simple.	Esia le bɔbɔe vie.
And he will go too.	Eye eya hã ayi.
He had worked long hours.	Ewɔ dɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe kpɔ.
I don’t want this.	Nyemedi esia o.
On the morning in question.	Le ŋdi si ŋu nya ku ɖo la ŋu.
If you know, please help.	Ne ènya la, taflatse kpe ɖe ŋuwò.
And people who are still here.	Eye ame siwo gakpɔtɔ le afisia.
This allows for two negative outcomes.	Esia na be nu gbegblẽ eve ate ŋu ado tso eme.
I don’t think that would make me happy.	Nyemesusu be ema ana makpɔ dzidzɔ o.
There are a few possible reasons for this.	Susu ʋɛ aɖewo li siwo ate ŋu anɔ esia ta.
The work became very difficult.	Dɔa va sesẽ ŋutɔ.
The project involved a lot of paperwork.	Dɔa bia agbalẽ geɖe wɔwɔ.
I'm sure there must be a few of them.	Meka ɖe edzi be ele be wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo nanɔ anyi.
I’m glad I came home.	Edzɔ dzi nam be meva aƒeme.
Leave school and work and everything else behind.	Suku kple dɔ kple nu bubu ɖesiaɖe gblẽ ɖi.
That leaves a lot of room for error.	Ema gblẽ vodada geɖe ɖi na vodada.
It happened this month.	Edzɔ le ɣleti sia me.
I have a bad neck.	Kɔ gbegblẽ aɖe le ŋunye.
So much has happened in the past year.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ dzɔ le ƒe si va yi me.
But know this.	Gake nya esia.
The car stopped.	Ʋua tɔ.
He couldn’t stay here.	Mete ŋu nɔ afisia o.
That took a long time.	Ema xɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
I needed to see you.	Ehiã be makpɔ wò.
His job is gone.	Eƒe dɔa nu yi.
I let myself go.	Meɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu.
It can happen many times, just once, or never.	Ate ŋu adzɔ zi geɖe, zi ɖeka ko, alo gbeɖe o.
These houses are beautiful.	Aƒe siawo nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
You have no attitude.	Nɔnɔme aɖeke mele asiwò o.
And we can do it.	Eye míate ŋui.
That would have been exciting.	Ema ado dzidzɔ na ame hafi.
This is what I’m upset about.	Esia te ɖe dzinye.
It could be the day before, a week or a month.	Ate ŋu anye ŋkeke si do ŋgɔ, kwasiɖa ɖeka alo ɣleti ɖeka.
He started to fall behind her.	Edze ge ɖe megbe nɛ.
The truth is the opposite.	Nyateƒea to vovo na ema.
Only a few of them.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe.
Mary was grateful for his help.	Mary da akpe ɖe eƒe kpekpeɖeŋu ta.
They are on the losing side.	Wole akpa si bu la dzi.
Our house is really nice.	Míaƒe aƒea nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It made more sense.	Susu geɖe wu nɔ eme.
None of them could.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mete ŋui o.
Have a little rest.	Dzudzɔ vi aɖe nanɔ asiwò.
Character is how you really are.	Nɔnɔme nye alesi nèle ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Be who you are.	Nye amesi nènye.
I remembered me last year at this time.	Meɖo ŋku dzinye le ƒe si va yi me le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
He sang a song that everyone knew.	Edzi ha aɖe si amesiame nya.
You’re bothering you.	Èle fu ɖem na wò.
His mouth was working.	Eƒe nu nɔ dɔ wɔm.
For two reasons.	Le susu eve aɖewo ta.
Everyone is fine.	Amesiame le nyuie.
I don’t know, not really.	Nyemenya o, menye le nyateƒe me o.
Please help me in finding the word.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye le nya la didi me.
He is doing well now.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie fifia.
Finding the right person is difficult.	Ame si sɔ la didi sesẽ.
Which, more than anything else, explains why he’s here.	Nusi, wu nu bubu ɖesiaɖe, ɖe nusita wòle afisia me.
He has nothing there.	Naneke mele esi le afima o.
He didn’t answer that either.	Meɖo nya ma hã ŋu o.
But that’s not all there is to it.	Gake menye ema koe nye ema o.
A long night and a busy morning.	Zã didi aɖe kple ŋdi si me vovo menɔ eŋu o.
Everyone knows you can be quick.	Amesiame nya be àte ŋu awɔ kaba.
They are there for me.	Wole afima nam.
We can allow for	Míate ŋu aɖe mɔ na .
And there is water here.	Eye tsi le afisia.
He has a job to do.	Dɔ aɖe le esi.
If he doesn’t belong here, he doesn’t belong anywhere.	Ne menye afisia tɔ wònye o la, ke menye afi aɖeke tɔ wònye o.
He almost lost his head.	Eƒe ta ƒo kloe.
It will get here anytime now.	Aɖo afisia ɣesiaɣi fifia.
We can do something.	Míate ŋu awɔ nane.
Yet no one came.	Ke hã ame aɖeke meva o.
He can’t stand it anymore.	Mate ŋu ado dzi azɔ o.
I have done more.	Mewɔ geɖe wu.
But now he cares about them.	Gake fifia etsɔ ɖe le eme na wo.
There seemed to be nothing he could do.	Edze abe naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ o ene.
It’s a perfect fit	Enye nusi sɔ nyuie
Try them on the last day of every month.	Te wo kpɔ le ɣleti ɖesiaɖe ƒe ŋkeke mamlɛtɔ dzi.
Those who have worked.	Ame siwo wɔ dɔ.
That may be true.	Ðewohĩ nya ma nye nyateƒe.
Yet his death also upsets us.	Ke hã eƒe ku hã doa dziku na mí.
Now the opposite happened.	Fifia nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ.
The dog had been the only one at home.	Avu la koe nɔ aƒeme tsã.
Tell your story.	Gblɔ wò nya.
But you’re not really here.	Gake menye ɖe nèle afisia ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I couldn’t believe the new results.	Nyemete ŋu xɔ nu yeye siwo do tso eme la dzi se o.
That sounds weird.	Ema ɖi nusi mewɔ nuku o.
I really had no idea.	Susu aɖeke menɔ asinye ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Perhaps they are.	Ðewohĩ wole nenema.
Another day or two, maybe.	Ŋkeke alo eve bubu, ɖewohĩ.
I'm sorry for this.	Meɖe kuku na esia.
Now, in the mind .	Fifia, le susu me .
I have a few of them.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo le asinye.
It’s about working together.	Enye be woawɔ dɔ ɖekae.
Everyone is worse off as a result.	Amesiame ƒe nɔnɔme gblẽ ɖe edzi le esia ta.
It's that simple.	Enye nusi le bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe.
I know this is true.	Menya be nya sia nye nyateƒe.
This isn’t someone.	Menye ame aɖee nye esia o.
The apartment is amazing.	Xɔa wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Someone give me a hand!	Ame aɖe na asi nam!
But he has everything.	Gake nusianu le esi.
You have to focus on your work.	Ele be wò susu nanɔ wò dɔa ŋu.
I really enjoy that.	Ema dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Maybe not for another year or so.	Ðewohĩ menye ƒe bubu alo esi wu nenema o.
But he won’t tell us what happened.    	Gake magblɔ nusi dzɔ la na mí o.    
Everyone knows about that part.	Amesiame nya nu tso akpa ma ŋu.
And it really doesn’t matter.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, mehiã o.
I don’t know what you’re trying to do.	Nyemenya nusi nèle agbagba dzem be yeawɔ o.
I think its really good for everybody.	Mesusu be eƒe nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ na ame sia ame.
That’s a big problem.	Ema nye kuxi gã aɖe.
Before, it was just something required by law.	Do ŋgɔ la, enye nane si se bia tso esi ko.
But someone won’t.	Gake ame aɖe ya mawɔe o.
We have to stay away from them.	Ele be míate ɖa le wo ŋu.
I have to work at night.	Ele be mawɔ dɔ le zã me.
But he can’t do it.	Gake mate ŋui o.
Again, a paradox.	Azɔ hã, nya aɖe si tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
For something fresh and new.	Na nu yeye kple nu yeye aɖe.
I know how to do that.	Menya alesi mawɔ emae.
Again, less is more.	Le afisia hã la, nu sue aɖe koe sɔ gbɔ wu.
If anyone can do this.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu awɔ esia.
In fact, we know very little about it.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu sue aɖe koe míenya tso eŋu.
But it seems possible.	Gake edze abe anya wɔ ene.
In fact, he didn’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
And you already have one.	Eye ɖeka le asiwò xoxo.
None of them will ever work.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mawɔ dɔ gbeɖe o.
He gave me the money.	Etsɔ ga la nam.
I needed one.	Mehiã ɖeka.
I believe in it.	Mexɔ edzi se.
Ya la ku.	Ya la ku.
Now back to work.	Azɔ trɔ yi dɔme.
Everything seemed to be working.	Edze abe nusianu nɔ dɔ wɔm ene.
He didn’t seem to trust us with them.	Edze abe meka ɖe mía dzi le wo gbɔ o ene.
Build your own life.	Tu wò ŋutɔ wò agbe ɖo.
I can’t do it alone.	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔe o.
You can do that.	Àte ŋu awɔ ema.
That place and that day.	Teƒe ma kple ŋkeke ma.
I was overwhelmed with anger.	Dziku xɔ aƒe ɖe menye.
I smirked at him.	Meka mo nɛ.
However, something is wrong.	Ke hã, nane gblẽ.
That day never came.	Ŋkeke ma meva kpɔ o.
We have known each other for a long time.	Míenya mía nɔewo ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
Say something.	Gblɔ nya aɖe.
It doesn’t do anything differently.	Mewɔa naneke le mɔ bubu nu o.
I’m sure you know what that is.	Meka ɖe edzi be ènya nusi ema nye.
This house was engulfed in flames.	Dzo xɔ aƒe sia.
I happened to be home that night.	Edzɔ be meva aƒeme le zã ma me.
It has been a pleasure to work with him over the years.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be mawɔ dɔ kplii le ƒe siwo va yi me.
But that’s not realistic.	Gake ema menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
There was no issue.	Nya aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
He had been there for maybe a week.	Ðewohĩ kwasiɖa ɖekae nye esia wònɔ afi ma.
If anyone can help, please contact me.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye la, taflatse te ɖe ŋunye.
And he can do it.	Eye ate ŋu awɔe.
I have never been able to explain it.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe eme kpɔ o.
I am the word police.	Nyee nye nya kpovitɔwo.
It’s just a good attitude.	Nɔnɔme nyui koe wònye.
She’s interested in a new guy.	Etsɔ ɖe le ŋutsu yeye aɖe me.
I believe in it.	Mexɔ edzi se.
They have to act together.	Ele be woawɔ nu ɖekae.
He will eat well tonight.	Aɖu nu nyuie le zã sia me.
Yet this doesn’t make sense.	Ke hã susu mele esia me o.
And it won’t be easy.	Eye manɔ bɔbɔe o.
A very strong hand.	Asi sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
It’s been two months.	Ɣleti eve enye sia.
That will be in each of us.	Ema anɔ mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe me.
We have a lot of work to do there as well.	Dɔ geɖe le mía si míawɔ le afima hã.

Which sounds like a word here and there.	Nusi ɖi nya aɖe le afisia kple afima.
That’s too easy.	Ema le bɔbɔe akpa.
He never wanted that.	Medi nenema gbeɖe o.
I heard you right.	Mese wò nyuie.
I couldn’t wait to try one.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ mɔ kpɔm be mate ɖeka kpɔ o.
However, it is not that easy.	Ke hã, mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
It will always be that way.	Anɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi.
The worst thing ever.	Nusi gblẽ wu ɖesiaɖe.
I think he can do it.	Mesusu be ate ŋu awɔe.
But he couldn’t tell her the truth.	Gake mete ŋu gblɔ nyateƒea nɛ o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I think you missed the point.	Mesusu be nya la to ŋuwò.
I never had free time.	Vovo menɔ ŋunye kpɔ o.
No one knew he was going to die in another year.	Ame aɖeke menya be ele kuku ge le ƒe bubu me o.
Everything good takes time.	Nu nyui ɖesiaɖe xɔa ɣeyiɣi.
It can happen anywhere.	Ate ŋu adzɔ le afi sia afi.
He never let me fall.	Meɖe mɔ nam medze anyi gbeɖe o.
Still, there was work.	Ke hã, dɔ nɔ anyi.
It doesn’t matter what the thing is.	Nukae nye nu la mehiã o.
This is still very simple actually.	Esia gakpɔtɔ le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I didn’t know to tolerate it.	Nyemenya be maɖe mɔ ɖe eŋu o.
He can do it with people, too.	Ate ŋu awɔe kple amewo, hã.
I knew he wouldn’t.	Menya be mawɔe nenema o.
Thanks so much to everyone who entered.	Akpe geɖe na amesiame si ge ɖe eme.
In fact, none of us did.	Le nyateƒe me la, mía dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
I haven’t heard anything about it yet.	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso eŋu haɖe o.
Everyone was eating.	Amesiame nɔ nu ɖum.
I carried a book.	Metsɔ agbalẽ aɖe ɖe asi.
But this didn’t sit well with him.	Gake esia menɔ anyi nɛ nyuie o.
I have your child.	Wò vi le asinye.
It didn’t offend him.	Medo dziku nɛ o.
As if it were the case.	Abe ɖe wòle nenema ene.
In the market here.	Le asi me le afisia.
This was kind of annoying.	Esia do dziku na ame aɖe ƒomevi.
They need to work together.	Ehiã be woawɔ dɔ ɖekae.
Get closer to it.	Te ɖe eŋu.
No one said anything else.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya bubu aɖeke o.
Maybe I will, too.	Ðewohĩ nye hã.
This is a difficult book.	Agbalẽ sesẽ aɖee nye esia.
Overall, he was a very good king.	Le nusianu me la, enye fia nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
That’s being efficient.	Emae nye be woawɔ dɔ nyuie.
He may not go on to win it.	Ðewohĩ ayi edzi aɖu edzi o.
Or else it will keep going.	Alo ne menye nenema o la, ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim.
Other than that, move on.	Ne menye ema o la, yi edzi.
With your help or die.	Le wò kpekpeɖeŋu me alo ku.
They are in fact.	Wole nyateƒe me.
I am not important.	Nyemele vevie o.

And, please be patient.	Eye, taflatse gbɔ dzi ɖi.
But the truth must live on.	Gake ele be nyateƒea nanɔ agbe.
I didn’t like that at all.	Ema medze ŋunye kura o.
Things changed, things stayed the same.	Nuwo trɔ, nuwo gakpɔtɔ nɔ nenema.
No one else did much to help.	Ame bubu aɖeke mewɔ nu geɖe tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu o.
In part because it was.	Le akpa aɖe me la, esi wònɔ nenema.
It didn’t help him.	Meɖe vi aɖeke nɛ o.
I don’t want him to be surprised between us.	Nyemedi be wòawɔ nuku le mía dome o.
There has to be something behind it.	Ele be nane nanɔ megbe nɛ.
This house suffered extensive water damage.	Tsi gblẽ nu le aƒe sia ŋu ŋutɔ.
I looked between them.	Mekpɔ wo dome.
You are definitely going about it the wrong way.	Èle edzi yim le mɔ gbegblẽ nu godoo.
Water is essential to life.	Tsi le vevie na agbe.
I don’t need to know anything else.	Mehiã be manya nu bubu aɖeke o.
But that’s not why.	Gake menye esia tae o.
But you already know that.	Gake ènya esia xoxo.
He treated us well.	Ewɔ nu ɖe ​​mía ŋu nyuie.
They’re made of meat.	Wɔe nam.
This felt amazing.	Esia se le eɖokui me be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This is similar, of course.	Esia sɔ kple esia ya.
I couldn’t turn around.	Nyemete ŋu trɔ o.
He can make himself do this.	Ate ŋu ana eɖokui nawɔ esia.
Couldn't find anything on search.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe naneke ŋu le didi me o.
But he escaped.	Gake esi dzo.
You're here.	Èle afisia.
How many of us reached out?	Mía dometɔ nenie do asi ɖe mía nɔewo ŋu?
It had never occurred to him.	Meva susu me nɛ kpɔ o.
And he has a point.	Eye nya aɖe le esi.
We will do this next week.	Míawɔ esia le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me.
This week means so much.	Kwasiɖa sia fia nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
Something in her manner irritated me.	Nane le eƒe nɔnɔme me do dziku nam.
Everything in me, everything in me.	Nusianu si le menye, nusianu si le menye.
This seems common sense.	Edze abe susu nyui le esia ŋu ene.
That is another possibility.	Ema hã nye nu bubu si ate ŋu adzɔ.
It plays no role in this process.	Mewɔa akpa aɖeke le ɖoɖo sia me o.
I didn’t feel anything.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be naneke o.
It’s a good thing.	Nu nyui aɖee wònye.
Impossible is not true.	Nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o menye nyateƒe o.
And you can have it.	Eye ate ŋu anɔ asiwò.
Water will not work.	Tsi mawɔ dɔ o.
The work is being done on a grand scale.	Wole dɔa wɔm le mɔ gã aɖe nu.
What he is doing is amazing.	Nusi wɔm wòle la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
His voice was positively disinterested.	Eƒe gbe metsɔ ɖeke le eme o nyuie.
It’s a different reality.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si to vovo.
I need to make one for, new for this system.	Ele be mawɔ ɖeka na, yeye na ɖoɖo sia.
This is only the first day.	Ŋkeke gbãtɔ koe nye esia.
I don’t have time to explain.	Ɣeyiɣi mele asinye maɖe eme o.
He has a good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖe le esi.
These days, we know so much.	Le ŋkeke siawo me la, míenya nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
It will be useful to us.	Aɖe vi na mí.
Not in any way, or in any way.	Menye le mɔ aɖeke nu o, alo le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
There was still plenty of room.	Teƒe geɖe nɔ anyi haɖe.
None of them seem to work for me.	Edze abe wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔa dɔ nam o ene.
It is the last of its kind.	Enye eƒe ƒomevi mamlɛtɔ.
I have to get out of here now.	Ele nam be mado le afisia fifia.
I wondered if they were going to die.	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe wole kuku ge hã.
But in reality, it is not at all.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, menye nenema kura o.
I got caught up in that moment.	Meva lé ɖokuinye ɖe ɣeyiɣi ma me.
No one could do anything.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
It was a surprise to him.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
Still, the point is good.	Ke hã, nya la nyo.
Some of us have done this in a small way.	Mía dometɔ aɖewo wɔ esia le mɔ sue aɖe nu.
I didn’t mind, he wanted.	Meɖe fu nam o, eya didi.
Life is so short.	Agbe le kpuie ale gbegbe.
That’s something we know best.	Ema nye nusi míenya nyuie wu.
That’s the point.	Emae nye nya la.
Things got better and better.	Nuwo va nyo ɖe edzi.
But there are good reasons for that.	Gake susu nyui aɖewo li siwo tae wòle nenema ɖo.
The past few years have been relatively stable.	Ƒe ʋɛ siwo va yi la li ke vie.
And it won’t be that way.	Eye manɔ nenema o.
He couldn't remember anything unpleasant that happened yesterday.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku naneke si medze ame ŋu si dzɔ etsɔ dzi o.
A large rock.	Kpe gã aɖe.
And there is something wrong with my job.	Eye nu gbegblẽ le nye dɔa ŋu.
He doesn't know how he got here.	Menya alesi wòwɔ va ɖo afisia o.
You have to act like everything is amazing.	Ele be nàwɔ nu abe ɖe nusianu wɔ nuku ene.
And there used to be no money.	Eye ga menɔ anyi o tsã.
There were several reasons for this.	Susu geɖe nɔ esia ta.
I actually did it.	Mewɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I felt my heart stop.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi tɔ te.
Make a day of it.	Wɔ ŋkeke ɖeka tso eŋu.
This helped me a lot.	Esia kpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ.
There really is no two-party system.	Le nyateƒe me la, akpa eve ƒe ɖoɖo aɖeke meli o.
Here, remember .	Le afisia la, ɖo ŋku edzi be .
Everything is right.	Nusianu sɔ.
I know what he wants.	Menya nusi dim wòle.
I doubt it though.	Meke ɖi le eŋu gake.
There is a place for them.	Teƒe aɖe li na wo.
I don’t think you can get rid of it.	Nyemesusu be àte ŋu aɖee ɖa o.
No one heard him, and no one cared.	Ame aɖeke mese eƒe gbe o, eye ame aɖeke hã metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
Someone important to me has died.	Ame aɖe si le vevie nam la ku.
There is help available.	Kpekpeɖeŋu li.
To do what?	Be woawɔ nukae?
You’re better than me.	Wòe nyo wu nye.
This part of life is short.	Agbe ƒe akpa sia le kpuie.
This device has many functions.	Mɔ̃ sia wɔa dɔ geɖe.
We can get that back.	Míate ŋu axɔ ema ake.
I see nothing wrong with that.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si gblẽ le ema ŋu o.
That was another time, another time.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi bubu, ɣeyiɣi bubu.
I objected but not seriously.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu gake menye vevie o.
Or at least it was for an hour or so.	Alo gaƒoƒo ɖeka alo esi wu nenema ya teti wònɔ nenema.
It can’t be him.	Mate ŋu anye eya o.
I know exactly what he did.	Menya nusi tututu wòwɔ.
Tom was embarrassed.	Ŋu kpe Tom.
Perhaps this is obvious.	Ðewohĩ esia dze ƒã.
Can anyone please help?.	Ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu taflatse?.
And you’re better off.	Eye wò hã nyo wu.
You seem very tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te ŋuwò ŋutɔ ene.
This wasn’t easy.	Esia menɔ bɔbɔe o.
Few can say that about him.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe ate ŋu agblɔ nya ma le eŋu.
I was the most excited.	Nyee do dzidzɔ nam wu.
However, there is a big issue here.	Ke hã, nya gã aɖe le afisia.
Not in an obvious way.	Menye le mɔ si dze ƒã nu o.
He couldn’t get past it.	Mete ŋu to eŋu o.
He deserves it.	Edze nɛ.
And now, too.	Eye fifia hã.
I can be my real self now.	Mate ŋu anye nye ŋutɔ nye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ fifia.
That somehow it has no cost.	Be le mɔ aɖe nu la, ga aɖeke mele eŋu o.
And, say .	Eye, gblɔ be .
Yet he had never been there.	Ke hã meva le afima kpɔ o.
That takes away something else.	Ema xɔa nu bubu aɖe le esi.
For her help in the house.	Le eƒe kpekpeɖeŋu le aƒea me ta.
You are a bad thing.	Ènye nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
Let me see you, touch you.	Na makpɔ wò, ka asi ŋuwò.
This should be done as well.	Ele be woawɔ esia hã.
It doesn’t make sense.	Susu mele eme o.
We will definitely do something with our lives.	Míawɔ nane kple míaƒe agbe godoo.
A place too far away.	Teƒe si didi akpa.
Here he was his own to everyone.	Le afisia la, eya ŋutɔ tɔ wònye na amesiame.
This is as true today as ever.	Esia nye nyateƒe egbea abe tsã ene.
Just kind of my thing.	Nye nu ƒomevi aɖe ko.
Put them together.	Ƒo wo nu ƒu ɖekae.
Nothing else matters to him.	Nu bubu aɖeke mele vevie nɛ o.
We have to fight them.	Ele be míawɔ avu kpli wo.
It almost happened last year.	Edzɔ kloe le ƒe si va yi me.
I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
Come and buy, come and buy.	Va ƒle, va ƒle.
This can be a difficult task.	Esia ate ŋu anye dɔ sesẽ aɖe.
We would do anything for each other.	Míawɔ nusianu na mía nɔewo.
I have said this.	Megblɔ nya sia.
Still, it worked.	Ke hã ewɔ dɔ.
There will be no mistakes this time.	Vodada aɖeke manɔ anyi zi sia o.
His heart melted for the first time.	Eƒe dzi xɔ dzo zi gbãtɔ.
I was nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe.
The people there welcomed them.	Ame siwo le afi ma la xɔ wo ɖe eme.
Nothing else plays a role here.	Nu bubu aɖeke mewɔa akpa aɖeke le afisia o.
I think we are like that.	Mesusu be míenye nenema.
If only he could understand.	Ne ɖe wòate ŋu ase egɔme.
Change them if you can.	Trɔ wo ne àte ŋui.
I think one lost his leg.	Mesusu be ɖeka bu eƒe afɔ.
He could not have known it would have come to this.	Mate ŋu anya be ava ɖo esia gbɔ hafi o.
Last year it was nothing.	Le ƒe si va yi me la, menye naneke o.
Therefore	Eya ta
For not being able to give up.	Le esi mete ŋu na ta o ta.
In fact, it’s the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo na ema.
I don’t have time to do this right now.	Ɣeyiɣi mele asinye mawɔ esia fifia o.
Not too exciting.	Menye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame akpa o.
Today is a great day.	Egbea nye ŋkeke gã aɖe.
I can’t go on like this.	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi alea o.
You should report this to the police.	Ele be nàgblɔ nya sia na kpovitɔwo.
Almost everyone does this.	Amesiame kloe wɔa esia.
The project has been in progress for some time.	Dɔa le edzi yim ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
The house is in good condition.	Aƒea le nɔnɔme nyui me.
There will never be another place like it.	Teƒe bubu aɖeke manɔ anyi abe esia ene gbeɖe o.
He is just one person.	Ame ɖeka koe wònye.
I have one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka le asinye.
This is not true at all.	Esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
My name is the only one with nothing.	Nye ŋkɔ koe nye esi ŋu naneke mele o.
That’s more than enough.	Ema sɔ gbɔ wu ema.
Someone will win and someone will lose.	Ame aɖe aɖu dzi eye ame aɖe hã aɖu dzi.
Everything worked fine last night.	Nusianu wɔ dɔ nyuie le zã si va yi me.
I'm light in the air.	Me le bɔbɔe le ya me.
But he was very pleased.	Gake edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
But not really.	Gake menye le nyateƒe me o.
No one knows much about it.	Ame aɖeke menya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o.
I’ve done it before.	Mewɔe kpɔ.
Buy whatever you want.	Ƒle nusianu si nèdi.
Thank you for that.	Akpe na wò ɖe ema ta.
And it’s not surprising.	Eye mewɔ nuku o.
And so another week passed.	Eye ale kwasiɖa bubu va yi.
Keep an eye on it as the work progresses.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie esime dɔa le edzi yim.
I made money.	Mekpɔ ga.
I like this one.	Esia dzɔa dzi nam.
He was such a good dog.	Enye avu nyui aɖe ale gbegbe.
It could have been a day or two.	Ate ŋu anye ŋkeke ɖeka alo eve hafi.
What the whole day had been.	Nusi ŋkeke bliboa nɔ tsã.
I was too stressed out last week.	Mete ɖe dzinye akpa le kwasiɖa si va yi me.
There was no room.	Xɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I never knew anyone by that name.	Nyemenya ame aɖeke kple ŋkɔ ma kpɔ o.
Logically, it will eventually happen.	Susu le eme be ava eme mlɔeba.
You can talk to him.	Àte ŋu aƒo nu kplii.
If you are having any problems, please contact us.	Ne kuxi aɖewo le fu ɖem na wò la, taflatse te ɖe mía ŋu.
There is only one thing to do.	Nu ɖeka koe li woawɔ.
It’s what the police have to do.	Enye nusi wòle be kpovitɔwo nawɔ.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I was waiting for you.	Menɔ lalam na wò.
That doesn’t fit.	Ema medze o.
People are rarely in a hurry here.	Ƒã hafi amewo nɔa du dzi le afisia.
He was a little kid.	Enye ɖevi sue aɖe.
It was a surprise to us.	Ewɔ nuku na mí ŋutɔ.
That strategy didn’t work, did it?	Aɖaŋu ma mewɔ dɔ o ɖe?
As if any of that would help.	Abe ɖe ema dometɔ aɖe akpe ɖe ame ŋu ene.
He was a small car and a very big man.	Ʋu sue aɖee wònye eye wònye ŋutsu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Let me be that way.	Na manɔ nenema.
Everything is fine now.	Nusianu le nyuie fifia.
Not with me on it, per se.	Menye kple nye le edzi o, le eɖokui si.
The apartment is also very nice.	Xɔa hã nyo ŋutɔ.

But stay tonight.	Gake nɔ anyi le zã sia me.
That sounds weird to me.	Ema ɖi nusi wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
Nothing came to pass.	Naneke meva dzɔ o.
Now things are different.	Fifia nuwo to vovo.
Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised.	Ðewohĩ mele be wòawɔ nuku na mí o.
Take a step.	Ðe afɔ aɖe.
I was always curious about that.	Medi vevie be manya nu tso nya ma ŋu ɣesiaɣi.
I don’t own the house.	Menye nyee nye aƒea tɔ o.

Or you can do it.	Alo àte ŋui.

Eyes that see past anything you can’t.	Ŋku siwo kpɔa nu to nusianu si màte ŋui o ŋu.

He started this.	Edze esia gɔme.
You have so much to offer.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le asiwò.
This is a great opportunity for me.	Esia nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe nam.

I like the summer.	Dzomeŋɔli dzɔa dzi nam.
Any place will work.	Teƒe ɖesiaɖe awɔ dɔ.
Still, it felt like something was missing.	Ke hã, ewɔ nam abe ɖe nane bu ene.
This thing is stable.	Nu sia li ke.
It’s something else entirely.	Enye nu bubu kura.
I know what it’s like.	Menya alesi wòle.
There was something else about it.	Nu bubu aɖe nɔ eŋu.
Not after all this time.	Menye le ɣeyiɣi siawo katã megbe o.
What if there is no tomorrow?	Ke ne etsɔ aɖeke meli o ɖe?
He did suddenly take an interest.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme zi ɖeka nyateƒe.
Its an eventful room.	Eƒe xɔ si me nu geɖe dzɔ le.
He is a role player.	Enye amesi wɔa akpa aɖe.
I searched and found something.	Medi nu eye meke ɖe nane ŋu.
I don’t know what it is.	Nyemenya nusi ƒomevi wònye o.
He couldn’t call her.	Mete ŋu ƒo ka nɛ o.
You said that.	Ègblɔ nya ma.
Pay attention to what your heart is doing.	Lé ŋku ɖe nu si wɔm wò dzi le la ŋu.
I am enjoying it.	Mele dzidzɔ kpɔm ɖe eŋu.
Not sure what to make of that.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ tso nya ma ŋu dzi o.
I was so glad I was eating.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be menɔ nu ɖum.
We can relax.	Míate ŋu aɖe dzi ɖi.
And so did he.	Eye eya hã.
I pretended not to understand.	Mewɔ abe ɖe nyemese egɔme o ene.
There was fire in his head.	Dzo nɔ eƒe ta me.
And that things are bad.	Eye be nuwo gblẽ.
Nothing new came to mind.	Nu yeye aɖeke meva susu me nam o.
It was quite a ship.	Enye meli aɖe ŋutɔ.
He ran his hand down her neck.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ƒu du to eƒe kɔ dzi.

There was no problem.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
But here it seems to be the opposite.	Gake le afisia la, edze abe nusi to vovo na emae wònye ene.
It's quite the opposite, that.	Enye nusi to vovo kura, be.
That’s what you are.	Wòe nye ema.

I'm very happy with them, myself.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ɖe wo ŋu, nye ŋutɔ.

Why do people gather here so early?	Nukatae amewo ƒoa ƒu ɖe afisia kaba nenema?
I could have controlled myself better.	Anye ne mate ŋu aɖu ɖokuinye dzi nyuie wu hafi.
I would have done that.	Anye ne mewɔe nenema.
And its this place.	Eye eƒe teƒe sia.
Thank you so much for any help!.	Akpe geɖe na mi ɖe kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe ta!.

That is very important to him.	Ema le vevie nɛ ŋutɔ.

An irregular bone in a dog’s foot.	Ƒu si mewɔa ɖoɖo o le avu ƒe afɔ me.
But there was nothing there.	Gake naneke menɔ afima o.
He himself did not know why he did this.	Eya ŋutɔ menya nu si tae wòwɔ esia ɖo o.
His heart almost stopped with this.	Eƒe dzi tɔ te kple esia kloe.
The person in charge of the project.	Ame si le dɔa dzi kpɔm.
I didn’t like that.	Ema medze ŋunye o.
I will be on the road.	Mava nɔ mɔ dzi.
Prices are going up a lot.	Nuwo ƒe asi le dzi yim ŋutɔ.
He needed the job.	Ehiã dɔa.
But this didn’t last too long.	Gake esia menɔ anyi eteƒe didi akpa o.
It’s just a small amount.	Susu sue aɖe koe wònye.
He never found fault with me.	Mekpɔ vodada le ŋunye kpɔ o.
I’m pretty sure it’s you.	Meka ɖe edzi tututu be wòe.
That he is yours.	Be eya wò ame si la.
But he did not find what was lost.	Gake meke ɖe nusi bu ŋu o.
He threw a lot at her.	Etsɔ nu geɖe ƒu gbe ɖe eŋu.
I had nothing to say.	Nya aɖeke menɔ asinye magblɔ o.
I wonder what that actually is.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be le nyateƒe me la, nukae ema nye hã.
But he didn’t say anything.	Gake megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I know some have done that.	Menya be ame aɖewo wɔe nenema.
But this doesn’t work.	Gake esia mewɔa dɔ o.
I had to do something.	Ele be mawɔ nane.
They are all the same.	Wo katã wole ɖeka.
Life is not as easy as it used to be.	Agbe mele bɔbɔe abe tsã ene o.
This is a real thing.	Esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I know a good place.	Menya teƒe nyui aɖe.
It can still happen.	Ate ŋu adzɔ kokoko.
It was a long time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.

It’s just a necessity.	Nusi hiã ko wònye.
Today, there is none.	Egbea la, ɖeke meli o.
I was worried about it.	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu.
Location, location, location.	Teƒe si wòle, teƒe si wòle, teƒe si wòle.
He tried, but couldn’t understand.	Edze agbagba, gake mete ŋu se egɔme o.
That is not true.	Nya ma menye nyateƒe o.
He didn't know this would be something he had to do.	Menya be esia anye nusi wòle be wòawɔ o.
I could never be him.	Nyemate ŋu anye eya gbeɖe o.
It’s more of a horse.	Enye sɔ wu.
This is a complete lie.	Esia nye alakpa kura.
Today he died.	Egbea ku.
He still didn’t care for her.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ kokoko o.
At any length of time.	Le ɣeyiɣi didi ɖesiaɖe me.
The teacher scratched his face.	Nufiala la ƒo eƒe mo.
It was just a big house.	Aƒe gã aɖe koe wònye.
With a man.	Le ŋutsu aɖe gbɔ.
I can’t tell you that though.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma na wò ya o.
It’s probably a good thing.	Anɔ eme be nu nyui aɖee.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Something new has emerged.	Nu yeye aɖe do mo ɖa.
And have a nice day.	Eye ɖa ŋkeke nyui aɖe.
We can’t do anything.	Míate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
But he didn’t do it.	Gake mewɔ ɖe edzi o.
There is a point about it.	Nya aɖe le eŋu.
Which is real, of course.	Nusi nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ya.
This was a surprise to us.	Esia wɔ nuku na mí ŋutɔ.
This is a great opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖee nye esia.
Kind of a good one.	Ƒomevi aɖe si nyo.
It doesn’t make much sense.	Menye ɖe susu le eme boo o.
I had expected it.	Mekpɔ mɔ nɛ tsã.
He never intended to do this.	Meɖoe be yeawɔ esia kpɔ o.
Make a plan.	Wɔ ɖoɖo aɖe.
Now the word came out.	Azɔ nya la do go.
They never had any problems at all.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ wo ŋu kura kpɔ o.
I had to get out of the house.	Ele be mado le aƒea me.
But it’s something, maybe.	Gake enye nane, ɖewohĩ.
I was among them.	Menɔ wo dome.
It seems easy.	Edze abe nu le bɔbɔe ene.
I can handle that.	Mete ŋu kpɔa ema gbɔ.
What is that ? 	Nukae nye ema?
It’s a bad thing.	Enye nu gbegblẽ.
Who knew he had one.	Amekae nya be ɖeka le ye si.
What do you think of the house?	Nukae nèsusu tso aƒea ŋu?
Something is very wrong with this.	Nane gblẽ le esia ŋu ŋutɔ.
I was talking to you about it.	Menɔ nu ƒom na wò tso eŋu.
I need help quickly.	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu kaba.

And now he was so tired, anyway.	Eye fifia ɖeɖi te eŋu ale gbegbe, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I hope it will be before.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be anye do ŋgɔ.
This doesn’t make sense.	Susu mele nya sia me o.
The man there now hurried away.	Ŋutsu si nɔ afi ma la wɔ kaba dzo azɔ.

I want to go to that room.	Medi be mayi xɔ ma me.
You would be the first to know.	Anye ne wòe nye ame gbãtɔ si anya.
You just want something more.	Ðeko nèdi nane si sɔ gbɔ wu.
The house is in a secluded area.	Aƒea me le teƒe aɖe si ame aɖeke mele o.
It never was, it never will be.	Menɔ anyi kpɔ o, manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
Perhaps part of it did.	Ðewohĩ eƒe akpa aɖe wɔe nenema.
In fact, it is.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele nenema.
Two chapters are better than one.	Ta eve nyo wu ɖeka.
Everything is on your side.	Nusianu le wò akpa dzi.
I can’t deny you either.	Nyemate ŋu agbe nya le wò hã ŋu o.
That part didn’t occur to him.	Akpa ma meva susu me nɛ o.
He will listen to you.	Aɖo to wò.
But there is no one.	Gake ame aɖeke meli o.
He couldn't decide what to do.	Mete ŋu tso nya me le nusi wòawɔ ŋu o.
And that’s all there is to it.	Eye ema koe nye ema.
It seems like such a waste.	Edze abe gbegblẽ alea gbegbe ene.
That's me.	Nyee nye ema.
This dress is so expensive!	Awu sia xɔ asi ŋutɔ!
Now, water interacts with the substance intensely.	Fifia, tsi wɔa dɔ kple nusi le eme vevie.
He wasn’t much better.	Menye ame si nyo wu kura o.
People are diligent.	Amewo doa vevie nu.
I never wanted to own a horse.	Nyemedi kpɔ be sɔ nanɔ asinye o.
But, honestly, we really can’t say what to do.	Gake, le nyateƒe me la, le nyateƒe me la, míate ŋu agblɔ nusi míawɔ o.
How do you think this should be done?.	Aleke nèsusu be ele be woawɔ esia?.
Other than that, you seem to have everything.	Ne menye nenema o la, edze abe nusianu le asiwò ene.
That will continue.	Ema ayi edzi.
None seems to work.	Edze abe ɖeke mewɔa dɔ o ene.
Everyone expected the project to be someone else’s problem.	Amesiame nɔ mɔ kpɔm be dɔa anye ame bubu ƒe kuxi.

It was a difficult time.	Ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖee.
But what happened happened.	Gake nu si dzɔ la va dzɔ.

And his seeing face.	Eye eƒe mo si kpɔa nu.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
He may have run away with someone today.	Ate ŋu adzɔ be esi kple ame aɖe egbea.

We can’t tell.	Míate ŋu anya o.

I can look that up on my own.	Mate ŋu adi ema le ɖokuinye si.
He lives alone.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔa agbe.
Let me tell you this.	Mina magblɔ nya sia na mi.
It was a huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖee.
He's in school.	Ele suku.

They are there, and they are looking for us.	Wole afima, eye wole mía dim.

Everything seemed to be fine.	Edze abe nusianu nɔ nyuie ene.

I stayed with him.	Metsi anyi kplii.
Like my mind lied to my heart.	Abe alesi nye susu da alakpa ɖe nye dzi ŋu ene.
There is nothing else.	Nu bubu aɖeke meli o.
Actually, not that long ago.	Le nyateƒe me la, menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia o.
And that should be the case.	Eye ele be ema nanɔ nenema.
However that goes for everything there.	Ke hã ema yi na nusianu le afima.
What city is this?	Du kae nye esia?
It’s just that way.	Ðeko wòle nenema.
The idea came out of it.	Susu la do le eme.
Part of me hates myself.	Nye akpa aɖe lé fu ɖokuinye.
These guys really know what they’re doing.	Ŋutsu siawo nya nusi wɔm wole ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I think that’s all for this season.	Mesusu be ema koe nye ɣeyiɣi sia tɔ.
He, who is	Eya, amesi nye
Someone else had found it.	Ame bubu aɖe hã ke ɖe eŋu kpɔ.
I don't understand what this is about.	Nyemese nusi ŋu nya sia ku ɖo gɔme o.
Come to us if you can.	Va mía gbɔ ne àte ŋui.
Everyone seemed to know each other.	Edze abe amesiame nya wo nɔewo ene.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Everything that happens will happen twice.	Nusianu si adzɔ la adzɔ zi eve.
It is a difficult thing to achieve.	Enye nusi gbɔ ɖoɖo sesẽ.
If there are people.	Ne amewo li la.
None of us had ever done that before.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ nu ma kpɔ o.
They had no children, only each other.	Vi aɖeke menɔ wo si o, wo nɔewo koe nɔ wo si.
This process takes two weeks.	Dɔ sia wɔwɔ xɔa kwasiɖa eve.
We knew we had to do something.	Míenya be ele be míawɔ nane.
But few listened carefully.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo ya ɖo to nyuie.
He threw himself into his work.	Etsɔ eɖokui ƒu gbe ɖe eƒe dɔa me.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
At least some of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo ya teti.
You have to deal with everyone else.	Ele be nàwɔ nu kple ame bubu ɖesiaɖe.
Stay on top of it.	Nɔ edzi.
I wish we could have done that.	Ne ɖe míate ŋui la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
This is also a lie.	Esia hã nye alakpa.
There is simply nothing.	Ðeko naneke meli o.
It doesn’t seem to have.	Edze abe mewɔe nenema o ene.
That needs to be worked on now.	Ele be woawɔ dɔ tso ema ŋu fifia.
He had the gun in his hand.	Tu la nɔ esi.
But he couldn’t see anything.	Gake mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
It is who he is.	Enye amesi wònye.
Understood.	Se egɔme.
And this is more than that.	Eye esia de ŋgɔ wu ema.
But the opposite is true.	Gake nusi to vovo na emae.
It worked out very well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
There were many missing persons.	Ame geɖe siwo bu la nɔ anyi.
I will be very brief.	Manɔ kpuie ŋutɔ.
His mind seemed to be on something else.	Edze abe eƒe susu nɔ nu bubu aɖe ŋu ene.
That is the truth.	Emae nye nyateƒea.
I got all of me now.	Mexɔ nye katã fifia.
This one works.	Esia wɔa dɔ.
Not a bad idea at all.	Menye susu gbegblẽ aɖeke kura o.
He couldn’t write.	Mete ŋu ŋlɔ nu o.
He didn’t seem to be there very long.	Edze abe ɖe menɔ afima ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o ene.
As it was, another teacher took his place.	Abe alesi wònɔ ene la, nufiala bubu va xɔ ɖe eteƒe.
I hope he does, too.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔe hã.
In my room.	Le nye xɔ me.
I doubt he would actually resign.	Meke ɖi be aɖe asi le eƒe dɔa ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s the heart of this day.	Emae nye ŋkeke sia ƒe dzi.
I'll talk to you shortly.	Maƒo nu kpli wò kpuie.
I think that’s pretty much it.	Mesusu be ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
It might have been something.	Ðewohĩ nu aɖee wònye hafi.
And neither will the money.	Eye ga la hã mawɔe nenema o.
His mouth couldn’t do them at all.	Eƒe nu mete ŋu wɔ wo kura o.
In his throat.	Le eƒe kɔ me.
Try something new.	Te nu yeye aɖe kpɔ.
Stop now, kid!	Dzudzɔ fifia, ɖevi!
Stop where you want.	Dzudzɔ le afisi nèdi.
I'm trying to.	Mele agbagba dzem.
The room consists of several subdivisions.	Xɔa me le akpa sue geɖe me.
It seems like.	Edze abe.
Or maybe it actually happened.	Alo ɖewohĩ edzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But he's fine with it now.	Gake ele nyuie le eŋu fifia.
It’s just there.	Ðeko wòle afima.
It was such a pleasure to be there.	Enye dzidzɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ be yeanɔ afima.
There was so much blood, he must have died.	Ʋu sɔ gbɔ ale gbegbe, anya ku.
I asked who that was.	Mebia be amekae nye ema hã.
We are not talking.	Menye ɖe míele nu ƒom o.
As it had been waiting for us.	Abe alesi wònɔ mía lalam tsã ene.
That was just amazing.	Ðeko ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
And his heart, too.	Eye eƒe dzi hã.
Just like it used to be.	Abe alesi wònɔ tsã ene.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso eŋu o.
But I think he looked a little tired, actually.	Gake mesusu be edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu vie ene, le nyateƒe me.
That made sense to him.	Susu nɔ nya ma me nɛ.
Not that much has changed in that regard.	Menye nu geɖe trɔ le go ma me nenema gbegbe o.
But I could be wrong.	Gake mate ŋu anye vodada.
And here it is, too.	Eye le afisia hã.
The whole process can take more than a day.	Dɔ bliboa ate ŋu axɔ wu ŋkeke ɖeka.
I can’t fire anyone.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe ame aɖeke le dɔ me o.
Like before that you can’t search.	Abe tsã ene be màte ŋu adi nu o.
I knew something was going on.	Menya be nane le edzi yim.
On death and death.	Le ku kple ku dzi.
Everything is fine which ends well.	Nusianu le nyuie si wu enu nyuie.
Not much help for me.	Menye kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe nam o.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
A nice house.	Aƒe nyui aɖe.
He took none of these steps.	Meɖe afɔ siawo dometɔ aɖeke o.
Which is impossible.	Nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I'm looking for what's wrong.	Mele nusi gblẽ la dim.
It’s painful for you.	Eve na wò.
His desire to do what is right is the ultimate desire.	Eƒe didi be yeawɔ nusi sɔ nye didi mamlɛtɔ.
We know it will always be fresh.	Míenya be anye nu yeye ɣesiaɣi.
He, who had seen the dog, said nothing.	Eya, si kpɔ avu la kpɔ la, megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Most likely, you are the same.	Anɔ eme godoo be wò hã nèle nenema ke.
I really don’t want to go.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be mayi o.
Like they have a point.	Abe alesi nya aɖe le wo si ene.
I had no desire for more.	Didi aɖeke menɔ menye be makpɔ nu geɖe wu o.
It makes more sense.	Susu geɖe wu le eme.
I have felt it myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ.
You can do better than that.	Àte ŋu awɔe nyuie wu ema.
I’m sure they had no idea what to do.	Meka ɖe edzi be nusi woawɔ la susu aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
That was his idea.	Emae nye eƒe susu.
Or you, to that.	Alo wò hã, va ɖo ema gbɔ.
I can’t explain better than that.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nu me nyuie wu ema o.
I was going to work.	Menɔ dɔ wɔ ge.
He couldn't hold his tongue.	Mete ŋu lé eƒe aɖe ɖe asi o.
And of course, start small.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, dze egɔme tso nu sue aɖe ko me.
Now, this is a really big deal.	Fifia, esia nye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That ends tomorrow.	Ema wu enu etsɔ.
How many years has that been.	Ƒe nenie nye ema.
What you did was very kind to me.	Nu si nèwɔ la nyo dɔme nam ŋutɔ.
I, too, have my part to play.	Nye hã, nye akpa aɖe le asinye mawɔ.
He will make arrangements for it.	Awɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
And the result can be quite impressive.	Eye nusi ado tso eme ate ŋu awɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi kura.
And there are reasons why.	Eye susu aɖewo li siwo tae.
The present case is of the latter kind.	Nya si li fifia la nye mamlɛtɔ ƒomevi.
I want to live a normal life.	Medi be manɔ agbe si sɔ.
He had no problem with that.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ eŋu le ema ŋu o.
I'll go now.	Mayi azɔ.
Time has done that.	Ɣeyiɣi wɔe nenema.
He can live with that.	Ate ŋu anɔ agbe kple ema.
Few of us can do without blood.	Mía dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe ate ŋu awɔ nu ʋu manɔmee.
Thousands of them.	Wo dometɔ akpe geɖe.
It didn’t surprise me.	Mewɔ nuku nam o.
Today is an exception.	Egbea hã nye esi to vovo.
Often, you can find what you are looking for.	Zi geɖe la, àte ŋu akpɔ nusi dim nèle la le eme.
We’re giving them what they want.	Míele nusi dim wole la nam wo.
But by no means the most efficient.	Gake menye esi wɔa dɔ nyuie wu kura o.
Finally, months or years later.	Mlɔeba le ɣleti alo ƒe aɖewo megbe.
It was a waste of time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
There is no rule against that, of course.	Se aɖeke meli si tsi tre ɖe ema ŋu o ya.
I just lost my job today.	Ðeko dɔ ge le asinye egbea.
Many homes were destroyed by fire.	Dzo gblẽ aƒe geɖe dome.
I actually did it.	Mewɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Find a way to do it.	Di mɔ aɖe.
I heard you say something.	Mese wò nya aɖe gblɔ.
But there is one real possibility.	Gake nu ɖeka aɖe li si ate ŋu adzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Everyone does this.	Amesiame wɔa esia.

Do go with.	Do go le.
I had to do something about it.	Ele be mawɔ nane tso eŋu.
You can help with it.	Àte ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu.
It’s almost impossible to interact with people.	Manya wɔ kloe be woawɔ nu kple amewo o.
We’re just about there.	Ðeko míele afima kloe.
OH! 	O!
I might withdraw.	Ðewohĩ maɖe ɖokuinye ɖa.
Appear in the pool.	Dze le ta la me.
Like others before him, his thoughts turned to home.	Abe ame bubu siwo do ŋgɔ nɛ tɔ ene la, eƒe susu trɔ ɖe aƒe ŋu.
He didn’t have a car.	Ʋu menɔ esi o.
It worked out well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
His voice.	Eƒe gbe.
Everyone went to one side.	Ame sia ame yi akpa ɖeka.
It’s as if the word has no real issue with itself.	Ðeko wòle abe ɖe nya la mekpɔ nya ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke tso eɖokui ŋu o ene.
But he worked really hard.	Gake ewɔ dɔ sesĩe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The house is beautiful.	Aƒea nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
I am not sure which one.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be wo dometɔ kae o.

Take the opposite side and vice versa.	Tsɔ akpa si tsi tre ɖe eŋu eye nàwɔ nenema ke.
Man, this is great!	Ŋutsu, esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ!
It is important to have a clear plan.	Ele vevie be ɖoɖo si me kɔ nanɔ ame si.

Not like last night.	Menye abe alesi wònɔ le zã si va yi me ene o.
We never know what will happen.	Míenya nusi ava dzɔ gbeɖe o.
Quite a lot, actually.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.

Maybe a room attached.	Ðewohĩ xɔ aɖe kpe ɖe eŋu.
Now that is so untrue.	Fifia nya ma menye nyateƒe ale gbegbe.
The room was warm.	Xɔa me xɔ dzo.
But, this year was different for me.	Gake, ƒe sia to vovo nam.
His car is very fast.	Eƒe ʋua le du dzi ŋutɔ.
We can’t go everywhere.	Míate ŋu ayi teƒe ɖesiaɖe o.
He obviously has his own thing.	Edze ƒã be eya ŋutɔ ƒe nu le esi.
There is no one to help us.	Ame aɖeke meli si akpe ɖe mía ŋu o.
I can’t do any of them.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
He looked tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ene.
Go to them.	Yi wo gbɔ.
You can’t have that.	Ema mate ŋu anɔ asiwò o.
And actually do it.	Eye wɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There were no deaths or serious complications.	Ku alo kuxi sesẽ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.

It seems we can hardly trust this one.	Edze abe míate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe ame sia ŋu kura o ene.
I can’t comment on that.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu o.
He didn’t see anyone.	Mekpɔ ame aɖeke o.
Things will find us.	Nuwo akpɔ mí.
Yet it is nothing.	Ke hã menye naneke o.
In fact, it would be very easy.	Le nyateƒe me la, anɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
That couldn’t have happened.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ hafi o.
And there’s someone else in the room.	Eye ame bubu aɖe hã le xɔa me.
This should work.	Ele be esia nawɔ dɔ.
He’s really great for me in a lot of ways.	Eye wònye gã nam ŋutɔŋutɔ le mɔ geɖe nu.
He had to act.	Ele nɛ be wòawɔ nu.
He is with us.	Ele mía gbɔ.
He was a very nice guy.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Everyone there knows at least one other person.	Amesiame si le afima nya ame bubu ɖeka ya teti.
If it works.	Ne ewɔ dɔ.
Thank you very much always.	Akpe geɖe na mi ɣesiaɣi.
All these years together.	Ƒe siawo katã ɖekae.
I don’t know what else to do.	Nyemenya nu bubu si mawɔ o.
This is nothing out of the ordinary.	Esia menye nusi to vovo kura o.
And you’re going to continue.	Eye nèle edzi yim.
Like many, in fact.	Abe ame geɖe ene la, le nyateƒe me.
This is all his fault.	Esia katã nye eƒe vodada.
And the most important one.	Eye esi le vevie wu.
I’ve come to this point.	Meva ɖo afisia.
. . . .	.
However, it worked once.	Ke hã, ewɔ dɔ zi ɖeka.
But we don’t know that.	Gake míenya nya ma o.
He just wasn’t eating at home.	Ðeko wònɔ nu ɖum le aƒeme o.
What is enough is enough.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ la sɔ gbɔ.
I understood very little, of course.	Nu sue aɖe koe mese egɔme ya.
It is a living, very active issue.	Enye nya si le agbe, si le dɔ dzi vevie ŋutɔ.
A hand that still worked.	Asi si gakpɔtɔ nɔ dɔ wɔm.
The other side.	Akpa bubu.
He had never met her.	Medo go kpɔ o.
Remove the liquid.	Ðe tsi si le eme la ɖa.
He has something on his mind.	Nane le susu me nɛ.
We hope you enjoyed this post.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be nya sia do dzidzɔ na wò ŋutɔ.
But his form wasn’t there yet.	Gake eƒe nɔnɔme menɔ anyi haɖe o.
You would have time.	Anye ne ɣeyiɣi anɔ asiwò.
This is still extreme.	Esia gakpɔtɔ nye nusi gbɔ eme.
A lot has changed this year.	Nu geɖe trɔ le ƒe sia me.
Death is only one way.	Mɔ ɖeka koe ku nye.
It might be interesting.	Ðewohĩ ado dzidzɔ na ame.
That happened.	Ema dzɔ.
He can’t do anything.	Mate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
We don’t know how he got there.	Míenya alesi wòwɔ va ɖo afima o.
You do know where you are.	Ènya afisi nèle ya.
There is nothing to do.	Naneke meli woawɔ o.
Do you know when the meeting is?	Ènya ɣeyiɣi si woawɔ kpekpea?
He heard nothing from them.	Mese naneke tso wo gbɔ o.
I will make time for this.	Makpɔ ɣeyiɣi na esia.
Looking for a small space.	Teƒe sue aɖe dim.
He didn’t care about me.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam o.
It’s not a place I want to be.	Menye teƒe si medi be manɔ o.
He didn’t say anything at all.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke kura o.
Use your common sense.	Zã wò susu nyui.
That was beforehand.	Ema nye do ŋgɔ.
Now he’s going to like her.	Fifia eƒe nu ava dzɔ dzi nɛ.
This is widely accepted.	Esia nye nusi dzi ame geɖe da asi ɖo.
My car was running fine.	Nye ʋua nɔ du dzi nyuie.
You have to have a device.	Ele be mɔ̃ aɖe nanɔ asiwò.
Maybe he didn’t understand them either.	Ðewohĩ eya hã mese wo gɔme o.
Take the time to plan your meals.	Di ɣeyiɣi nàwɔ ɖoɖo ɖe wò nuɖuɖu ŋu.
Do whatever you want.	Wɔ nu sia nu si nèdi.
I know exactly what that little thing is.	Menya nusi tututu nu sue ma nye.
Which is the first part.	Nusi nye akpa gbãtɔ.
Someone has to be in charge.	Ele be ame aɖe nanɔ dɔa dzi kpɔm.
No one else was there.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afima o.
He didn’t know anything wrong.	Menya nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
It just doesn’t matter that much.	Ðeko wòle vevie nenema gbegbe o.
The quality was excellent throughout.	Nɔnɔme nyui la nyo ŋutɔ le ɣeyiɣi bliboa me.
It could have been me.	Ate ŋu anye nyee hafi.
After all, every once in a while it was just one man.	Le nyateƒe me la, zi ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi aɖewo me la, ŋutsu ɖeka koe wònye.
But as things stand now.	Gake abe alesi nuwo le fifia ene.
Get out of there.	Do go le afima.
No, no, no!	Ga, ga, ga!
But there is nothing we can do.	Gake naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ o.
In a way, it doesn’t fit into any of them.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, mewɔ ɖeka kple wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
Can't go too far yet.	Mate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ akpa haɖe o.
We can’t stay here.	Míate ŋu anɔ afisia o.
But it is a system.	Gake enye ɖoɖo.
Now go ahead and do it.	Azɔ yi edzi.
I had to make a home for myself.	Ele nam be mawɔ aƒe aɖe na ɖokuinye.
Help may be available.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
No one can tell him what to do.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu agblɔ nusi wòawɔ nɛ o.
Something seemed to have let go.	Edze abe nane ɖe asi le eŋu ene.
He can’t help himself.	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe eɖokui ŋu o.
He patted his head with a hand.	Etsɔ asi aɖe ƒo ta ɖe ta.
Maybe he could talk to her until another night.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu aƒo nu kplii vaseɖe zã bubu me.
It is very easy for them.	Ele bɔbɔe na wo ŋutɔ.
That is not true.	Ema menye nyateƒe o.
You’ve done it.	Wòe wɔe.
This won’t do you any good later.	Esia maɖe vi aɖeke na wò megbe o.
Are you there.	Ele afima.
What a wonderful man you are.	Ŋutsu nyui kae nye si nènye.
I have tried this.	Mete esia kpɔ.
This is not true at all.	Esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
Not hard for someone like him.	Menye nu sesẽ na ame aɖe abe eya ene o.
Things used to be bad.	Nuwo gblẽ tsã.
Many people used to be like that.	Ame geɖe nɔ nenema tsã.
Consider these moments, if you can.	Bu ɣeyiɣi siawo ŋu kpɔ, ne àte ŋui.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This wasn’t working.	Esia menɔ dɔ wɔm o.
But not for food.	Gake menye ɖe nuɖuɖu ta o.
I needed to know who did it.	Ehiã be manya amesi wɔe.
Finally, a voice of reason.	Mlɔeba la, susu ƒe gbe aɖe ɖi.
Yet no one else seems to know about it.	Ke hã edze abe ame bubu aɖeke menya nu tso eŋu o ene.
I worked hard all day.	Mewɔ dɔ sesĩe ŋkeke bliboa.
I'm not ready.	Nyemele klalo o.
He didn’t know anything.	Menya naneke o.
This is not the case either.	Nya sia hã mele eme o.
That missed the point.	Ema to nya la ŋu.
I don’t know why it is.	Nyemenya nu si tae wòle o.
Tell me more about that book.	Gblɔ nu geɖe nam tso agbalẽ ma ŋu.
Obviously, one of them is time.	Edze ƒã be wo dometɔ ɖekae nye ɣeyiɣi.
That is why life existed.	Esia tae agbe nɔ.
My car is fine.	Nye ʋua le nyuie.
I heard about it this morning.	Mese nu tso eŋu ŋdi sia.
I didn’t know what to say to him.	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ nɛ o.
It didn’t make sense to me.	Susu menɔ eme nam o.
And you.	Kple wò.
Too much time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe akpa va yi.
And not now, either.	Eye menye fifia o.
Not against one person.	Menye ɖe ame ɖeka ŋu o.
He gave us everything we have.	Etsɔ nu sia nu si le mía si la na mí.
New life always comes in the background.	Agbe yeye va le megbe ɣesiaɣi.
Start here again.	Dze egɔme tso afisia ake.
It’s not that bad.	Menye nu gbegblẽ nenema gbegbe o.
You don’t have to do anything more.	Mehiã be nàwɔ naneke wu ema o.
These ideas did not work well.	Susu siawo mewɔ dɔ nyuie o.
There are thousands of them.	Wo dometɔ akpe geɖe li.
This is nothing.	Esia menye naneke o.
It made sense to me.	Susu nɔ eme nam.
There was no room for error.	Vodada ƒe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Stay on the highway.	Nɔ mɔ gã la dzi.
That seemed to help.	Edze abe ema kpe ɖe ame ŋu ene.
And maybe that’s true.	Eye ɖewohĩ nya ma nye nyateƒe.
I heard a car engine start in the room.	Mese ʋu ƒe mɔ̃ aɖe dze dɔ gɔme le xɔa me.
Something is terribly wrong.	Nane gblẽ vevie ŋutɔ.
But he couldn’t.	Gake mete ŋui o.
It doesn’t make sense.	Susu mele eme o.
I can understand it.	Mate ŋu ase egɔme.
He couldn't get the nagging voice out of his head.	Mete ŋu ɖe gbe si nɔ fu ɖem nɛ la le ta me o.
I didn’t find any.	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke o.
However, the plaintiff.	Ke hã, amesi tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu.
But the opposite happened.	Gake nusi to vovo na ema va dzɔ.
There were very strong reasons for this.	Susu sesẽ ŋutɔ aɖewo nɔ anyi siwo tae wòle be woawɔ esia ɖo.
So far, few have understood.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe se egɔme.
That in itself is a great thing.	Ema ŋutɔ nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Now, there was only my face.	Fifia, nye mo koe nɔ afima.
It will all be gone by this time next year.	Wo katã nu ayi le ƒe si gbɔna ƒe ɣeyiɣi sia me.
I think maybe that’s the point of this.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ emae nye nya si le esia ŋu.
We had four weeks to work on the project.	Kwasiɖa ene nɔ mía si be míawɔ dɔ tso dɔa ŋu.
This is just our time.	Míaƒe ɣeyiɣi koe nye esia.
I like my hair.	Nye ɖa dzɔa dzi nam.
No one made eye contact.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ ŋku ɖe ame ŋu o.
That is very difficult.	Ema sesẽ ŋutɔ.
And a little .	Eye vi aɖe hã .
But no one was there, apparently.	Gake ame aɖeke menɔ afima o, edze abe.
A blood splattered his leg.	Ʋu aɖe ƒo ɖe eƒe afɔ ŋu.
I have a new desire.	Didi yeye aɖe le asinye.
It just couldn’t happen.	Ðeko mete ŋu adzɔ o.
They had a reason.	Susu aɖe nɔ wo si.
And they only have one gun.	Eye tu ɖeka koe le wo si.
That is the truth of it.	Emae nye nyateƒe si le eme.
I'm going.	Ado go.
I need money.	Mehiã ga.
We have so much more to offer.	Nu geɖe wu ema le mía si míawɔ.
Take a word out.	Tsɔ nya aɖe ɖa.
There is rarely too much time on a project.	Ƒã hafi ɣeyiɣi geɖe nɔa dɔ aɖe ŋu akpa.
But that wasn’t what worried him.	Gake menye emae tsi dzi nɛ o.
A great surprise.	Nu gã aɖe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Everything was going great.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔ.
I don’t have time for everyone.	Ɣeyiɣi mele asinye na amesiame o.
Where could he go?	Afikae wòate ŋu ayi?
He was a man of order.	Enye ŋutsu si wɔa nu ɖe ​​ɖoɖo nu.
That’s what I’m talking about.	Emae nye nye nya.
We’re ready when you’re ready.	Míele klalo ne èle klalo.
He worked very hard.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe ŋutɔ.
You can find another one.	Àte ŋu ake ɖe bubu ŋu.
I can’t stand it if something happens to her.	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi ne nane dzɔ ɖe edzi o.
To live my life, my own life.	Be manɔ nye agbe, nye ŋutɔ nye agbe.
I can’t go out like this.	Nyemate ŋu ado go alea o.
And he didn’t care.	Eye metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
What house will we have this afternoon?	Aƒe kae anye mía tɔ ŋdɔ sia?
I don’t want to deal with this.	Nyemedi be makpɔ esia gbɔ o.
It almost felt like home.	Ewɔ nam abe aƒe ene kloe.
As it was, it was.	Abe alesi wònɔ ene.
He is never there again.	Megale afima gbeɖe o.
Clearer in due course.	Eme kɔ wu le ɣeyiɣi si sɔ me.
There was a mistake.	Vodada aɖe nɔ anyi.
The building was amazing.	Xɔa na amewo wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
The interesting thing is the car.	Nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame enye ʋua.
I am not, so sorry.	Menye nenema, ale gbegbe be meɖe kuku.
And it’s totally amazing to be here.	Eye ewɔ nuku kura be mele afisia.
He will find them.	Ake ɖe wo ŋu.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
Now one thing.	Azɔ nu ɖeka.
But that fell flat.	Gake ema dze anyi.
That also costs money.	Ema hã xɔa ga.
If only that were true.	Ne ɖe nya ma nye nyateƒe.
I'm not really sure how to do this.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi mawɔ esia dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Use any of these names.	Zã ŋkɔ siawo dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe.
But from the real.	Gake tso ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I didn’t know what to expect.	Nyemenya nusi makpɔ mɔ na o.
This is another great thing.	Esia hã nye nu gã bubu.
We need to do this now.	Ele be míawɔ esia fifia.
No major problems.	Kuxi gã aɖeke meli o.
I see more in this than you do.	Mekpɔ nu geɖe le esia me wu wò.
Think about it this way.	Bu eŋu kpɔ alea.
Which probably will.	Nusi ɖewohĩ awɔe.
There was nothing between us.	Naneke menɔ mía dome o.
Yet he could not see.	Ke hã mete ŋu kpɔ nu ɖa o.
He had a little money.	Ga vi aɖe nɔ esi.
There are many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe li.
We can’t sit down and talk.	Míate ŋu anɔ anyi aɖo dze o.
We don’t know yet.	Míenya haɖe o.
That you are not a good person.	Be menye ame nyuie nènye o.
But without that .	Gake ema manɔmee la .
And we have nothing to do.	Eye naneke mele mía si míawɔ o.
He is usually alone.	Zi geɖe la, eya ɖeka koe nɔa anyi.
It will make sense.	Susu anɔ eme.
It’s a very, very good book.	Enye agbalẽ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
It might turn out not to be that expensive.	Ðewohĩ ava dzɔ be mexɔ asi nenema gbegbe o.
I have never heard anyone say this.	Mese ame aɖeke gblɔ nya sia kpɔ o.
We can help people who need help.	Míate ŋu akpe ɖe ame siwo hiã kpekpeɖeŋu ŋu.
So far everything has worked great.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nusianu wɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
I was also working against time.	Menɔ dɔ wɔm tsi tre ɖe ɣeyiɣi ŋu hã.
I heard a lot of good things about it.	Mese nya nyui geɖe tso eŋu.
He’s interested in it.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme.
It makes sense today.	Susu le eme egbea.
We know it will go some places.	Míenya be ayi teƒe aɖewo.
Not these days.	Menye le ŋkeke siawo me o.
For whatever it used to be.	Na nusianu si wònye tsã.
Water is essential for life.	Tsi hiã vevie na agbe.
This would be a logical thing to do.	Esia anye nusi me susu le be woawɔ.
I was so nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ale gbegbe.
His tired eyes looked up.	Eƒe ŋku siwo ŋu ɖeɖi te la fɔ mo dzi.
No one can do everything.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ nusianu o.
A new year, a new life for us.	Ƒe yeye, agbe yeye na mí.
I was happy today.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ egbea.
Looks like a device is missing.	Edze abe mɔ̃ aɖe bu ene.
Finally the child entered.	Mlɔeba ɖevi la ge ɖe eme.
I really enjoyed that part of it.	Eƒe akpa ma do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
Take this part aside.	Tsɔ akpa sia ɖe vovo.
For the last time.	Zi mamlɛtɔ.
Who can remember it.	Amekae ate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi.
Start this life right.	Dze agbe sia gɔme nyuie.
And there’s nothing he can do about it.	Eye naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu o.
The price of one person.	Ame ɖeka ƒe asi.
His heart stood still.	Eƒe dzi tsi tre.
None of them knew what to do.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menya nusi wòawɔ o.
There is something there now.	Nane li le afima fifia.
I own my own time.	Nye ŋutɔ nye ɣeyiɣi tɔ menye.
This seems really weird.	Esia dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
And above all, treat people as people.	Eye ƒo wo katã ta la, wɔ nu ɖe ​​amewo ŋu abe amewo ene.
Guide you through the entire process.	Fia mɔ wò le ɖoɖo bliboa me.
There was nothing he could do for her, not yet.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ nɛ o, menye haɖe o.
People were just angry.	Ðeko amewo do dziku.
Remove excess water.	Ðe tsi si sɔ gbɔ ɖe eme la ɖa.
Start small, but really start.	Dze egɔme tso sue, gake le nyateƒe me la, dze egɔme.
That shows what kind of man you are.	Ema ɖe ŋutsu si ƒomevi nènye fia.
You are a part of me.	Wòe nye nye akpa aɖe.
He doesn’t seem to be the right person.	Edze abe menye ame si sɔ o ene.
The police will be asking some questions.	Kpovitɔwo anɔ nya aɖewo biam.
You have to be more strategic.	Ele be nàwɔ aɖaŋu geɖe wu.
We are just getting started.	Ðeko míele egɔme dzem.
It seemed normal to me.	Edze nam abe nusi sɔ ene.
However, everything else did.	Ke hã, nu bubu ɖesiaɖe wɔe.
But this is not true.	Gake esia menye nyateƒe o.
It wasn’t like that.	Menɔ nenema o.
I will continue to help you there.	Mayi edzi akpe ɖe ŋuwò le afima.
They will do you some good there.	Woawɔ nyui aɖewo na wò le afima.
Do this now!	Wɔ esia fifia!
I didn’t know he would do that.	Nyemenya be awɔ ema o.
I compared them.	Metsɔ wo sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
And that’s really only one part of it.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, eƒe akpa ɖeka koe nye ema.
I don’t really want to.	Nyemedi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Every word sounded good.	Nya ɖesiaɖe ɖi nyuie.
What it is we don’t know.	Nusi wònye la míenya o.
Or myself for that matter.	Alo nye ŋutɔ le nya ma ta.
Think about this for yourself.	Wò ŋutɔ bu nya sia ŋu.
Doing a good job with that.	Dɔ nyui aɖe wɔwɔ kple ema.
You just can’t tell them the same thing now.	Ðeko màte ŋu agblɔ nya ma ke na wo fifia o.
We don’t know what they want.	Míenya nusi dim wole o.
Everyone is looking for their own way.	Amesiame le eƒe mɔ dim.
Stay with us, everyone.	Nɔ mía gbɔ, amesiame.
That’s about it though.	Ema ku ɖe eŋu gake.
It’s a small place.	Enye teƒe sue aɖe.
And he wasn’t so sure of himself.	Eye meka ɖe eɖokui dzi nenema gbegbe o.
I couldn’t keep them inside.	Nyemete ŋu lé wo ɖe eme o.
I’m not sure what that is, exactly.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi ema nye dzi o, tututu.
Maybe they broke up.	Ðewohĩ wo dome gblẽ.
One word can say a lot.	Nya ɖeka ate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe.
But it was only one time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi ɖeka koe wònye.
Treat them differently, that is.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu le mɔ bubu nu, si fia be.
Get out of the house.	Do go le aƒea me.
From my mouth.	Tso nye nu me.
Now something is different.	Fifia nane to vovo.
That much is obvious.	Nu ma gbegbe dze ƒã.
Two people died here.	Ame eve ku le afisia.
But this has changed in recent years.	Gake esia trɔ le ƒe ʋɛ siwo va yi me.
My car stopped there.	Nye ʋua tɔ ɖe afima.
But do it.	Gake wɔe.
I want to see how you are.	Medi be makpɔ ale si nèle.
So was everyone else.	Nenema ke ame sia ame hã nɔ.
It started off well.	Edze egɔme nyuie.
I know how much you want something like that.	Menya alesi gbegbe nèdi nane si le abe ema ene.
Destroy them.	Gblẽ wo dome.
That is no easy task.	Ema menye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖeke o.
Tom wasn’t really there.	Tom menɔ afima ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I’m glad everyone is fine in that role.	Edzɔ dzi nam be amesiame le nyuie le akpa ma me.
I don’t mean to offend you.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mado dziku na wò o.
We know what they are doing.	Míenya nusi wɔm wole.
In the life of the.	Le agbe me.
The others in the room looked at each other.	Ame bubu siwo nɔ xɔa me la lé ŋku ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
Not down like you are.	Menye ɖe anyi abe alesi nèle ene o.
No one was talking to anyone else.	Ame aɖeke menɔ nu ƒom na ame bubu aɖeke o.
That’s what they like.	Ema dzɔa dzi na wo.
No one was at home.	Ame aɖeke menɔ aƒeme o.
It might take a little while.	Ðewohĩ axɔ ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe.
He seemed very interested.	Edze abe etsɔ ɖe le eme vevie ene.
I don’t always want to do this.	Nyemedi be mawɔ esia ɣesiaɣi o.
Blood but not blood.	Ʋu gake menye ʋu o.
This can be a problem.	Esia ate ŋu anye kuxi.
They have no jobs, no skills, and no schools.	Dɔ aɖeke mele wo si o, aɖaŋu aɖeke mele wo si o, eye suku aɖeke mele wo si o.
I'm really talking.	Mele nu ƒom ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He did this before, of course.	Ewɔ esia do ŋgɔ ya.
I was a little angry.	Medo dziku vie.
I might have to try that.	Ðewohĩ ahiã be mate ema kpɔ.
I didn’t have to do anything.	Mehiã be mawɔ naneke o.
His own person.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe ame.
It can’t be anything else.	Mate ŋu anye nu bubu aɖeke o.
And there has to be a place.	Eye ele be teƒe aɖe nanɔ.
And we need to create a better system.	Eye ele be míawɔ ɖoɖo si nyo wu.
Maybe he will be happy in his own home.	Ðewohĩ akpɔ dzidzɔ le eya ŋutɔ ƒe aƒeme.
Anyone could have had that in their home.	Amesiame ate ŋu akpɔ ema le eƒe aƒeme hafi.
In your opinion.	Le wò susu nu.
That’s my city.	Emae nye nye du.
Do go with.	Do go le.
Some things are just too expensive.	Ðeko nu aɖewo xɔ asi akpa.
It’s a good idea.	Susu nyui aɖee.
I was doing something great.	Menɔ nu gã aɖe wɔm.
I think that was a big mistake on my part.	Mesusu be vodada gã aɖee nye ema le nye akpa dzi.
And something else .	Eye nu bubu aɖe hã .
I just want to know where it is.	Ðeko medi be manya afi si wòle.
Life is as good as it can be.	Agbe nyo alesi wòate ŋui.
Set aside the part that represents your life up to this point.	Ðe akpa si tsi tre ɖi na wò agbe la ɖe vovo vaseɖe afisia.
His character is still there.	Eƒe nɔnɔme gakpɔtɔ li.
Clear and simple.	Eme kɔ eye wòle bɔbɔe.
His face was very beautiful.	Eƒe mo nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
I’m not feeling well.	Nyemele nyuie o.
In fact, we can go further.	Le nyateƒe me la, míate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu ema.
It’s not possible.	Manya wɔ o.
You have to be focused.	Ele be wò susu nanɔ nu ŋu.
I don’t know how you get us out of that last one.	Nyemenya alesi nàwɔ aɖe mí le mamlɛtɔ ma me o.
Spend more time with people.	Zã ɣeyiɣi geɖe ɖe amewo ŋu.
All my stuff is gone.	Nye nuwo katã nu yi.
And well it could happen.	Eye nyuie ate ŋu adzɔ.
Its hard work.	Eƒe dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ.
There is so much to do!	Nu geɖe li woawɔ!
There is nothing else.	Nu bubu aɖeke meli o.
He tried hard.	Edze agbagba vevie.
I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
And that’s what’s so exciting.	Eye emae nye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
I know these people.	Menya ame siawo.
He didn’t have any of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ esi o.
I finally got something working.	Meva kpɔ nane si le dɔ wɔm mlɔeba.
Someone will come.	Ame aɖe ava.
And have respect for yourself.	Eye bubu nanɔ asiwò.
And so do you.	Eye wò hã.
I can’t help myself.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke le ɖokuinye ŋu o.
There are two rooms in the house.	Xɔ eve ye le aƒea me.
It will take you out of your current situation.	Aɖe wò ɖa le nɔnɔme si me nèle fifia me.
However, it doesn’t work.	Ke hã, mewɔa dɔ o.
No one believed him.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ edzi se o.
What shouldn’t you do?	Nu kae mele be nàwɔ o?
It’s a fascinating thing	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame
This is often difficult.	Zi geɖe la, esia sesẽ.
But this one is pretty simple.	Gake nya sia ya le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
He can still be the first.	Ate ŋu anye ame gbãtɔ kokoko.
He could hardly bear to be in the room with her.	Mete ŋu do dzi kura be yeanɔ xɔa me kplii o.
They are going to work.	Wole dɔ me yim.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But this is nothing new.	Gake esia menye nu yeye o.
If there are any mistakes, print them.	Ne vodada aɖewo li la, ta wo.
This cannot continue.	Esia mate ŋu ayi edzi o.
That’s the downside of this project.	Emae nye dɔ sia ƒe akpa si gblẽ.
It’s a really big deal.	Enye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Maybe it’s a good thing.	Ðewohĩ nu nyui aɖee.
And well it could happen.	Eye nyuie ate ŋu adzɔ.
Everyone has that.	Ema le amesiame si.
This isn’t one.	Esia menye ɖeka o.
I have to be angry.	Ele be mado dziku.
It is tormenting the dead.	Ele fu ɖem na ame kuku.
They would have been awesome.	Anye ne woawɔ nuku ŋutɔ hafi.
And they are moving forward.	Eye wole ŋgɔ yim.
Thinking about something is good.	Nane ŋu bubu nyo.
It just doesn’t work.	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ o.
There was a lot of space.	Teƒe geɖe nɔ afima.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe li siwo tae.
That is not true!	Ema menye nyateƒe o!
You have your own space.	Wò ŋutɔ wò teƒe le asiwò.
That’s one thing.	Ema nye nu ɖeka.
A very happy situation.	Nɔnɔme si me dzidzɔ le ŋutɔ.
Two years have passed since that night.	Ƒe eve va yi tso zã ma me.
I need more money.	Mehiã ga geɖe wu.
And it can be done.	Eye ate ŋui hã.
It can happen.	Ate ŋu adzɔ.
That didn’t surprise me.	Ema mewɔ nuku nam o.
Maybe that’s what I don’t understand.	Ðewohĩ emae nye nusi gɔme mese o.
They have an open mind.	Susu si ʋu le wo si.
Lots of good ideas.	Susu nyui geɖe.
This angered many.	Esia do dziku na ame geɖe.
This is important in many applications.	Esia le vevie le dɔ geɖe wɔwɔ me.
I didn’t really want to talk to him.	Nyemedi boo aɖeke be maƒo nu kplii o.
Nothing, really.	Naneke meli o, le nyateƒe me.
Talk them through it.	Ƒo nu na wo to eme.
We will fight.	Míawɔ avu.
It’s not possible.	Manya wɔ o.
Really challenge myself to do something better.	Tsɔ nya ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ be mawɔ nane si nyo wu.
He was the only survivor of the car.	Eya ɖeka koe tsi agbe le ʋua me.
I really don’t know what to say.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nya si magblɔ o.
Please have a good life.	Taflatse agbe nyui nanɔ asiwò.
He didn’t know what happened.	Menya nusi dzɔ o.
It worked out very well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
That doesn’t matter.	Ema mele vevie o.
It doesn’t ask for a reason.	Mebiaa susu aɖeke o.
Look at things from a completely different perspective.	Lé ŋku ɖe nuwo ŋu le mɔ bubu kura nu.
It didn’t take long.	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
But the police were there.	Gake kpovitɔwo nɔ afima.
There is no tomorrow here.	Etsɔ aɖeke meli le afisia o.
There was one other person in the room.	Ame bubu ɖeka hã nɔ xɔa me.
It would be pretty simple.	Anye nusi le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Did something happen?	Ðe nane dzɔa?
Maybe that doesn’t matter.	Ðewohĩ ema mehiã o.
It’s not a good thing at all.	Menye nu nyui aɖeke kura o.
I'm not sure exactly how to do it.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi tututu mawɔe dzi o.
I didn’t touch it.	Nyemeka asi eŋu o.
No one else was here.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afisia o.
He did not replace them.	Mexɔ ɖe wo teƒe o.
There would be no space.	Anye ne teƒe manɔ anyi o.
Now you will take over.	Azɔ wòe axɔ edzi.
This result would be important for two reasons.	Nusi ado tso eme sia anɔ vevie le susu eve ta.
I have never felt so depressed.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be nu te ɖe dzinye nenema gbegbe o.
There is nothing on them.	Naneke mele wo dzi o.
However, the dog was never a dog.	Ke hã, avu la menye avu kpɔ o.
He tried to go to work, too.	Edze agbagba be yeayi dɔme, eya hã.
Do a good job.	Wɔ dɔ nyui aɖe.
He didn’t know where he was.	Menya afi si wòle o.
Until we know if it’s true or not.	Vaseɖe esime míenya nenye be enye nyateƒe alo menye nyateƒe o.
There is too much here.	Nu geɖe akpa le afisia.
On my head.	Le nye ta dzi.
And it’s something you want too.	Eye enye nusi wò hã nèdi.
This means he is doing something right.	Esia fia be ele nane wɔm nyuie.
He will usually win.	Zi geɖe la, aɖu dzi.
Get on that, right now.	Do ɖe ema dzi, fifia tututu.
It’s probably going to be that way.	Anɔ eme be anɔ eme nenema.
I want to enjoy it.	Medi be makpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu.
Who gave this command?	Amekae de se sia?
This thing here, that thing there.	Nu sia le afisia, nu ma le afima.
I would have been expecting it.	Anye ne mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ hafi.
Someone made the whole thing.	Ame aɖee wɔ nu bliboa.
I am fine.	Meli nyuie.
You are my rock.	Wòe nye nye kpe.
There is no ship.	Meli o.
The search happened well after that.	Didi la dzɔ le ema megbe nyuie.
I too would like to say something here.	Nye hã madi be magblɔ nya aɖe le afisia.
I did the opposite.	Mewɔ nu si to vovo na emae.
I struggle with it.	Mewɔa avu ɖe eŋu.
All you need is one small piece of sand.	Nusi hiã koe nye ke sue ɖeka.
I wondered what would happen?.	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae adzɔ hã?.
For some reason, he really didn’t like these guys.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, le nyateƒe me la, ŋutsu siawo medze eŋu o.
You can’t prove it too strongly.	Màte ŋu aɖo kpe edzi sesĩe akpa o.
There must be something he can do.	Ele be nane nanɔ anyi si wòate ŋu awɔ.
No one at all.	Ame aɖeke kura o.
I need to have more time.	Ele be ɣeyiɣi geɖe nanɔ asinye.
How many people died as a result?	Ame nenie ku le esia ta?
Turn back now.	Trɔ ɖe megbe fifia.

That doesn’t work here.	Ema mewɔa dɔ le afisia o.
I would rather see them live.	Anyo nam wu be makpɔ wo le agbe.
But he didn’t listen.	Gake meɖo to o.
It just made my night.	Ðeko wòwɔ nye zã la.
It’s not cheap.	Menye nusi mexɔ asi o ye wònye o.
You don’t know what else to say.	Mènya nya bubu si nàgblɔ o.
People come to thank me.	Amewo va doa akpe nam.
Money or sand though.	Ga alo ke hã.
Really, really great.	Nyateƒe, gã ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Now start this for me.	Azɔ dze nya sia nam.
But something was bothering me about it.	Gake nane nɔ fu ɖem nam le eŋu.
He wasn’t in a hurry.	Menye ɖe wònɔ du dzi o.
I got a job.	Mekpɔ dɔ aɖe.
I am truly convinced.	Meka ɖe edzi nyateƒe.
The police were able to organize.	Kpovitɔwo te ŋu wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe nu ŋu.
There are very few men.	Ŋutsu ʋɛ aɖewo koe li.
Maybe something hit them.	Ðewohĩ nane dze wo dzi.
But it’s not yet.	Gake menye haɖe o.
It will never be the same.	Manɔ abe tsã ene gbeɖe o.
He had already tried twice.	Edze agbagba zi eve xoxo.
This too will pass away.	Esia hã ava yi.
He couldn’t see or hear anything.	Mete ŋu kpɔ naneke alo se naneke o.
Do it for us, you know.	Wɔe na mí, ènya.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I want to do so many things.	Medi be mawɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
Your last time.	Wò zi mamlɛtɔ.
In fact, this is already benefiting us.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia le vi ɖem na mí xoxo.
What needs to be done is clear.	Nusi wòle be woawɔ la me kɔ nyuie.
It is much more than that.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema kura.
Involved.	Le eme.
He is alive now.	Ele agbe fifia.
It’s always just kind of a work in progress.	Dɔ ƒomevi aɖe si le edzi yim koe wònye ɣesiaɣi.
Be careful now.	Kpɔ nyuie fifia.
I'm sorry.	Meɖe kuku.
Police at that point.	Kpovitɔwo le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
But maybe too much time.	Gake ɖewohĩ ɣeyiɣi geɖe akpa.
I probably shouldn’t have married anyone at that point in my life.	Anɔ eme be mele be maɖe ame aɖeke le nye agbe ƒe ɣeyiɣi ma me hafi o.
I just can’t tell what was on his mind.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu anya nusi nɔ susu me nɛ o.
My kind, or his kind.	Nye ƒomevi, alo eƒe ƒomevi.
In fact, it’s the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo na ema.
I'll meet you soon.	Mado go kpuie.
Closer to home.	Te ɖe aƒe ŋu wu.
It makes a lot of sense too.	Susu le eme ŋutɔ hã.
It looked good to him.	Edze nyuie nɛ.
Maybe I shouldn’t.	Ðewohĩ mele be mawɔe o.
Nothing seems to be working.	Edze abe naneke mele dɔ wɔm o ene.
Check out this book.	Kpɔ agbalẽ sia ɖa.
Two at the same time.	Eve le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
But it can’t be that way.	Gake mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
It’s all a lie, a lie, a lie.	Wo katã nye alakpa, alakpa, alakpa.
Looking for one of our people.	Míaƒe amewo dometɔ ɖeka dim.
This result is not new.	Nusi do tso eme sia menye nu yeye o.
I'll call about it.	Maƒo ka tso eŋu.
It’s not easy.	Mele bɔbɔe o.
You have the last meal.	Nuɖuɖu mamlɛtɔ le asiwò.
Maybe he doesn’t know what it is.	Ðewohĩ menya nusi wònye o.
And nobody ultimately cared.	Eye ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme mlɔeba o.
He was so surprised that he couldn't answer her.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ale gbegbe be mete ŋu ɖo eŋu nɛ o.
There and not there.	Afima eye menye afima o.
The task ahead was daunting.	Dɔ si nɔ wo ŋgɔ la sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I thought he was wearing me out.	Mesusu be ele nye lãme dom.
But the reality is quite different.	Gake nyateƒea ya to vovo kura.
His men passed this way at night.	Eƒe amewo to mɔ sia dzi le zã me.
Only good things will come out.	Nu nyui koe ado tso eme.
But too much is wrong.	Gake nu geɖe wɔwɔ nye nu gbegblẽ.
It’s not going to happen.	Menye ɖe wòle edzi yim o.
But it’s a good thing.	Gake enye nu nyui aɖe.
There are all these difficulties.	Nu sesẽ siawo katã li.
He seems to be waiting for someone.	Edze abe ele ame aɖe lalam ene.
You are new to this.	Ènye ame yeye le esia me.
His face fell down.	Eƒe mo dze anyi.
No one knows what will happen.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi adzɔ o.
But still this is pretty good.	Gake esia kokoko esia nyo ŋutɔ.
But no one did that.	Gake ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
He had one hand.	Asi ɖeka nɔ esi.
I’m not so sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o.
That would have been amazing.	Ema awɔ nuku ŋutɔ hafi.
On the back of his neck.	Le eƒe kɔ ƒe megbe.
No fire is needed.	Dzo aɖeke mehiã o.
Officially, this is true.	Le se nu la, esia nye nyateƒe.
In addition, log in monthly.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu la, ge ɖe eme ɣleti sia ɣleti.
Or not you right now.	Alo menye wòe fifia o.
To create life.	Be woawɔ agbe.
But much else is wrong.	Gake nu bubu geɖe hã gblẽ.
And one thing is very clear.	Eye nu ɖeka me kɔ ŋutɔ.
Everything was fine.	Nusianu nɔ nyuie.
No one else can know about your work.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu anya nu tso wò dɔa ŋu o.
Everyone has their own reality.	Amesiame kple eƒe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s a good news.	Nya nyui aɖee wònye.
You know where you want to go.	Ènya afi si nèdi be yeayi.
Help your dog.	Kpe ɖe wò avu ŋu.
That might be more useful.	Ema ate ŋu aɖe vi wu.
He was very attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
For no mistake, lose your mind.	Le vodada aɖeke ta la, bu wò susu me na wò.
I have done it for many people.	Mewɔe na ame geɖe.
Actually, edit that.	Le nyateƒe me la, trɔ asi le nya ma ŋu.
And it doesn’t matter.	Eye mehiã o.
Keep that in mind for sure.	Ema nanɔ susu me nam godoo.
It was like talking to himself.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe wòle nu ƒom na eɖokui ene.
She lives alone in a small house.	Eya ɖeka koe le aƒe sue aɖe me.
Nothing interested him.	Naneke metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ o.
You hope it is.	Èle mɔ kpɔm be ele nenema.
Doing a good job with this.	Dɔ nyui aɖe wɔwɔ kple esia.
No one would tell me anything.	Ame aɖeke magblɔ nya aɖeke nam o.
Some of them may go.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo ate ŋu ayi.
He seemed satisfied.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme ene.
I can’t be the only one here.	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu anye ame si le afisia o.
He couldn’t let go of himself.	Mete ŋu ɖe asi le eɖokui ŋu o.
A more difficult part.	Akpa aɖe si sesẽ wu.
I'm the one.	Nyee nye la.
I couldn’t find his car.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe eƒe ʋua ŋu o.
I am convinced of it now.	Meka ɖe edzi fifia.
It looked like something dead.	Edze abe nane si ku ene.
You’re obviously going to get more than that.	Edze ƒã be èle nusi wu ema xɔ ge.
It was a very good fit.	Enye nusi sɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
I got this part.	Mexɔ akpa sia.
But there was a big problem.	Gake kuxi gã aɖe nɔ anyi.
OH! 	O!
I think he put his past in the past.	Mesusu be etsɔ eƒe agbe si wònɔ va yi la de ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me.
Thank you for everything.	Akpe na wò ɖe nusianu ta.
I'll see something else.	Makpɔ nu bubu aɖe hã.
I'll see who killed them.	Makpɔ amesi wu wo.
He never touched me.	Meka asi ŋunye kpɔ o.
Two if it is in the neck.	Eve nenye be ele kɔ me.
And he hasn’t been able to do that yet.	Eye mete ŋu wɔe nenema haɖe o.
I had to try something new.	Ele be mate nu yeye aɖe kpɔ.
It’s not easy, folks.	Mele bɔbɔe o, amewo.
Not in his own time.	Menye le eya ŋutɔ ƒe ɣeyiɣi me o.
He’s a fascinating guy.	Eƒe nu lé dzi na ame.
This wasn’t easy.	Esia menɔ bɔbɔe o.
He would if he could.	Awɔe ne ate ŋui.
Not for anyone.	Menye na ame aɖeke o.
And that didn’t make sense.	Eye susu menɔ nya ma me o.
Many people now speak two or more languages.	Ame geɖe doa gbe eve alo esi wu nenema fifia.
That’s like something you would do.	Ema le abe nane si nàwɔ ene.
I heard they were going to live.	Mese be wole agbe nɔ ge.
It’s not that difficult.	Menye nu sesẽ nenema gbegbe o.
Be careful if you are new to it.	Kpɔ nyuie ne ènye ame yeye le eme.
None of them can do it.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋui o.
Please go this way.	Taflatse to mɔ sia dzi.
I gave him a hand.	Metsɔ asi nɛ.
It didn’t work either.	Mewɔ dɔ hã o.
Check out where it is.	Kpɔ afisi wòle ɖa.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Now comes the incredible part.	Fifia akpa si mexɔ se o la va.
I don’t know his name.	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ o.
I also gave myself up.	Metsɔ ɖokuinye na hã.
Exactly how it was.	Ale si tututu wònɔ.
I will tell you why this happened.	Magblɔ nu si tae esia dzɔ ɖo la na mi.
Everything was available here.	Nusianu nɔ anyi le afisia.
I promised that.	Medo ŋugbe nenema.
It is a personal matter.	Enye ame ŋutɔ ƒe nya.
And I didn’t understand much of it.	Eye nyemese nu geɖe gɔme tso eme o.
And it worked well.	Eye wòwɔ dɔ nyuie.
Two men in bad shape.	Ŋutsu eve siwo le nɔnɔme gbegblẽ me.
The police opened fire.	Kpovitɔwo da tu.
Everything else will probably continue as it is.	Ðewohĩ nu bubu ɖesiaɖe ayi edzi anɔ abe ale si wòle ene.
But it’s just a minor issue.	Gake nya sue aɖe koe.
For the sake of the king!	Le fia la ta!
It is possible that we can always hear something.	Ate ŋu adzɔ be míate ŋu ase nane ɣesiaɣi.
It was a wonderful opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ nyui aɖee wònye.
And in some ways they are.	Eye le mɔ aɖewo nu la, wole nenema.
In a bad way.	Le mɔ gbegblẽ aɖe nu.
I think it’s a good thing.	Mesusu be enye nu nyui aɖe.
Now everything is back.	Fifia nusianu trɔ gbɔ.
Many people here own guns, legally and illegally.	Tu le ame geɖe si le afisia, le se nu kple le mɔ si mele se nu o nu.
This works very well.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
No one treated him that way.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu nenema o.
That in itself is amazing.	Ema ŋutɔ wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
We are ready for this.	Míele klalo na esia.

It’s not a difficult situation.	Menye nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖee wònye o.

It’s not for anything.	Menye naneke tae wòle o.
He can’t do this.	Mate ŋu awɔ nu sia o.
Between you and me, the police have no chance.	Le mía kple wò dome la, mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke mele kpovitɔwo si o.
You are asking too much.	Èle nu geɖe biam akpa.
Spring arrived quickly.	Dzomeŋɔli ɖo kaba.
Maybe it would be better.	Ðewohĩ anyo wu.
Give it a year or two.	Na ƒe ɖeka alo eve nɛ.
But now everything has changed.	Gake fifia nusianu trɔ.
That is far more important.	Ema le vevie wu kura.
He probably won’t.	Ðewohĩ mawɔe nenema o.
But now it worked to his advantage.	Gake fifia ya, ewɔ dɔ ɖe vi nɛ.
That was easy.	Ema nɔ bɔbɔe.
Everyone speaks the same language.	Amesiame doa gbe ɖeka.
I found it two weeks ago.	Meke ɖe eŋu kwasiɖa eve enye sia.
This year it will be no different.	Le ƒe sia me la, manɔ nenema kura o.
He didn’t say much about anything.	Megblɔ nya geɖe tso nya aɖeke ŋu o.
I saw something my mind couldn’t take.	Mekpɔ nane si nye susu mate ŋu axɔ o.
Maybe he lost a teacher.	Ðewohĩ nufiala aɖe bu nɛ.
We didn’t have a room.	Xɔ aɖeke menɔ mía si o.

He was focused on it.	Eƒe susu nɔ eŋu.

I couldn’t get my head around it.	Nyemete ŋu tsi ta le ta o.
These clothes absorb sweat.	Awu siawo xɔa fifia.

I would like to tell myself that it could never happen.	Madi be magblɔ na ɖokuinye be mate ŋu adzɔ gbeɖe o.

I think that’s the right thing to do.	Mesusu be emae nye nu si sɔ be woawɔ.

And therefore we are discouraged.	Eye le esia ta dzi ɖe le mía ƒo.
All we have to do is work well together.	Nusi wòle be míawɔ koe nye be míawɔ dɔ ɖekae nyuie.
We have to plan for it.	Ele be míawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.

Do it any way you like.	Wɔe le mɔ ɖesiaɖe si dze ŋuwò nu.
He faced a difficult challenge.	Edze ŋgɔ kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
It doesn’t seem real.	Edze abe menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o ene.
He was pleased with her for this.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ɖe esia ta.
But he never came.	Gake meva kpɔ o.
This is money.	Esia nye ga.
It’s so amazing!	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ!
This thing will kill you.	Nu sia awu wò.
But this came over time.	Gake esia va le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe.
I can only speak for myself.	Nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye koe mate ŋu aƒo nu.
It just existed.	Ðeko wònɔ anyi.
I’ve said that before.	Megblɔ nya ma do ŋgɔ.
In the end, it may have worked out better.	Mlɔeba la, ɖewohĩ ewɔ dɔ nyuie wu.
It didn’t look like her face at all.	Medze abe eƒe mo ene kura o.
He did a lot of my songs.	Ewɔ nye ha geɖe.
Do go, do go, do go.	Do go, do go, do go.
But try this.	Gake te esia kpɔ.
Maybe he'll see them soon.	Ðewohĩ akpɔ wo kpuie.
At that point, nothing could be better.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, naneke mate ŋu anyo wu esia o.
Any problem let us know!.	Kuxi ɖesiaɖe na míenya!.
But he didn’t do either.	Gake mewɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
Maybe he doesn’t trust me either.	Ðewohĩ eya hã meka ɖe dzinye o.
Another party worked to establish a legal case.	Akpa bubu hã wɔ dɔ tsɔ ɖo nya aɖe anyi le se nu.
We have the lake.	Ta la le mía si.
Maybe it will work.	Ðewohĩ awɔ dɔ.
I think we’re in for a hard time.	Mesusu be míele kuxi sesẽ aɖe me tom.
It’s not a bad job.	Menye dɔ gbegblẽ o.
I will do that in the morning.	Mawɔe nenema le ŋdi me.
No one came out.	Ame aɖeke medo go o.
Everyone can see what it is.	Amesiame ate ŋu akpɔ nusi wònye.
Think about rising prices.	Bu nu ŋu le nuwo ƒe asi siwo le dzi yim ŋu.
You usually don’t need a plan.	Zi geɖe la, mehiã be nàwɔ ɖoɖo aɖeke o.
Some of them	Wo dometɔ aɖewo .
However, this trend has changed in recent years.	Gake nɔnɔme sia trɔ le ƒe ʋɛ siwo va yi me.
But we can’t kill them.	Gake míate ŋu awu wo o.
Who did this?	Amekae wɔ esia?
I don’t know where he is.	Nyemenya afi si wòle o.
It was a great place.	Teƒe gã aɖee wònye.
There are deeper problems.	Kuxi siwo de to wu la li.
But we can’t go home for two reasons.	Gake míate ŋu ayi aƒeme le susu eve aɖewo ta o.
A lot of people.	Ame geɖe ŋutɔ.
It seemed impossible to me.	Ewɔ nam be manya wɔ o.
This man is strong, but unworthy.	Ŋutsu sia sesẽ, gake medze o.
An empty room.	Xɔ aɖe si me ame aɖeke mele o.
Get out really well.	Do go nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I just wanted to say thank you.	Ðeko medi be magblɔ be akpe na wò.
Go to his heart.	Yi eƒe dzi me.
I'll call you tomorrow.	Maƒo ka na wò etsɔ.
I think it’s very important.	Mesusu be ele vevie ŋutɔ.
But that’s just an idea.	Gake susu aɖe koe nye ema.
Bad.	Gbegblẽ.
Not much in itself.	Menye nu geɖe le eya ŋutɔ me o.
I put my head down.	Metsɔ nye ta ɖo anyi.
Something is up, but we don’t know what’s going on.	Nane le dzi yim, gake míenya nusi le edzi yim o.
Or so and higher.	Alo nenema kple esi kɔ wu.
He will overcome it, or he won’t.	Aɖu edzi, alo mawɔe o.
They’re just bigger and faster.	Ðeko wole gã wu eye wole du dzi wu.
That much is right.	Nu geɖe ma sɔ.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Menye nu bɔbɔe aɖe si woawɔ o.
I will eventually be happy.	Adzɔ dzi nam mlɔeba.
I did it.	Mewɔe.
Another four weeks.	Kwasiɖa ene bubu.
I think that makes sense.	Mesusu be susu le nya ma me.
Not like him.	Menye abe eya ene o.
There’s no easy way, right?	Mɔ bɔbɔe aɖeke meli o, alo?
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
He can actually do things.	Ate ŋu awɔ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Our house was destroyed by fire.	Dzo gblẽ míaƒe aƒea dome.
There is just no way, no way.	Ðeko mɔ aɖeke meli o, mɔ aɖeke meli o.
Not that I necessarily enjoyed it.	Menye ɖe mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu kokoko o.
That doesn’t work, of course.	Ema mewɔa dɔ o ya.
But there was nothing.	Gake naneke menɔ anyi o.
Which is just weird.	Nusi nye nusi wɔ nuku ko.
There is no good reason.	Susu nyui aɖeke meli o.
Come to us, guys.	Va mía gbɔ.
Do your job.	Wɔ wò dɔa.
Two reasons may explain this.	Susu eve aɖewo ate ŋu aɖe esia me.
That’s the hardest part.	Emae nye akpa si sesẽ wu.
Let me address this issue.	Mina makpɔ nya sia gbɔ.
I can’t tell what it was like.	Nyemate ŋu anya alesi wònɔ o.
Maybe he was just waiting for someone.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe koe wònɔ lalam.
If it’s nothing, it’s nothing.	Ne menye naneke o la, ke menye naneke o.
I am giving them now.	Mele wo nam fifia.
What did you do? 	Nukae nèwɔ?
This is a very good book.	Esia nye agbalẽ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I don’t understand why he’s here.	Nyemese nusita wòle afisia gɔme o.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
More than an hour.	Nusi wu gaƒoƒo ɖeka.
The meeting may still be in progress.	Ðewohĩ kpekpea anɔ edzi yim kokoko.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He didn’t know what to do.	Menya nusi wòawɔ o.
The person in front looks back.	Ame si le ŋgɔ la kpɔa megbe.
It was a bit small, but it worked.	Enye xɔ sue aɖe vie, gake ewɔ dɔ.
If only he could reach them.	Ne ɖe wòate ŋu aɖo wo gbɔ ko la.
It was a wonderful thing.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Now from the.	Azɔ tso.
Treat them as human beings.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu abe amewo ene.
It will take much longer.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi wu kura.
He can’t do anything.	Mate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
I’m sure he wouldn’t either.	Meka ɖe edzi be eya hã mawɔe nenema o.
This looks good to me.	Esia dze nam nyuie.
But, we had to plan for them at night.	Gake, ele be míawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe wo ŋu le zã me.
In fact, he didn’t plan it either.	Le nyateƒe me la, eya hã mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu o.
And you know what it’s like.	Eye ènya ale si wòle.
I have a reason.	Susu aɖe le asinye.
Give it a few months or a year.	Na ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo alo ƒe ɖeka nɛ.
It doesn’t make sense, it doesn’t make sense.	Susu mele eme o, susu mele eme o.
As a result of this.	Esia wɔe be.
That was my last one.	Emae nye nye mamlɛtɔ.
Have money, have everything.	Ga nanɔ asiwò, nusianu nanɔ asiwò.
It was too weird for me really.	Ewɔ nuku akpa nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He had done his job well.	Ewɔ eƒe dɔa nyuie kpɔ.
Give her a good month.	Na ɣleti nyui aɖe nɛ.
That might work.	Ema ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
This is some really great stuff.	Esia nye nu gã aɖewo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But today is not a good day.	Gake egbea menye ŋkeke nyui aɖeke o.
Make it work for everything.	Na wòawɔ dɔ na nusianu.
Delete the following statement.	Tsɔ nya si gbɔna la ɖa.
You like the truth.	Nyateƒea dzɔa dzi na wò.
Almost everyone.	Amesiame kloe.
It’s a real place.	Enye teƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe.
Definitely reach out and say something.	Do asi ɖa nàgblɔ nya aɖe godoo.
I didn’t mean to do it.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔe o.
This was very upsetting to me.	Esia te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
But he didn’t feel it.	Gake mese le eɖokui me o.
That’s my name.	Emae nye nye ŋkɔ.
But you’re ahead.	Gake èle ŋgɔ.
What would you say?.	Nya kae nàgblɔ?.
There were many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe nɔ anyi.
Or anything, really.	Alo nusianu, le nyateƒe me.
Divide them into two parts.	Ma wo ɖe akpa eve me.
Nothing is an issue.	Naneke menye nya o.
It seems impossible.	Edze abe manya wɔ o ene.
But he didn’t grow up either.	Gake eya hã metsi o.
Check the air tonight.	Kpɔ ya le zã sia me.
This is a good news.	Nya nyui aɖee nye esia.
He can’t do that.	Mate ŋu awɔe nenema o.
On a piece of paper.	Le agbalẽ aɖe dzi.
Are you the one? 	Wòe nye ema?
There is little, if any, exception.	Nu boo aɖeke meli si to vovo na esia o, ne ɖe li hã.
And he didn’t head to his room.	Eye meɖo ta eƒe xɔ me o.
That’s just who you are.	Ame si nènye koe nye ema.
Just a little bit is good.	Vi aɖe koe nyo.
The one you have now.	Ame si le asiwò fifia.
There are so many things we need to do together.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li siwo wòle be míawɔ ɖekae.
Give it some time to work.	Na ɣeyiɣi aɖee wòawɔ dɔ.
I tried a few of them.	Mete wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo kpɔ.
That changed today.	Ema trɔ egbea.
It will be great.	Anye gã.
Water is essential to life.	Tsi le vevie na agbe.
Call if you have any questions.	Ƒo ka ne nya aɖe le asiwò.
If anyone has any other ideas, please let me know.	Ne ame aɖe si susu bubu aɖe le la, taflatse na manya.
It can become very difficult.	Ate ŋu ava sesẽ ŋutɔ.
There were no serious problems.	Kuxi sesẽ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
There is nothing that will do the same.	Naneke meli si awɔ nenema ke o.
And he didn’t do that to anyone else.	Eye mewɔ nu ma ɖe ame bubu aɖeke ŋu o.
Which is pretty amazing.	Nusi nye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Thousands came out, every month.	Ame akpe geɖe do go, ɣleti sia ɣleti.
And there was one man.	Eye ŋutsu ɖeka nɔ anyi.
There are some good things about it.	Nu nyui aɖewo le eŋu.
It will take some time to get there.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe hafi aɖo afima.
I am working hard right now.	Mele dɔ wɔm sesĩe fifia.
Everything should be fine now.	Ele be nusianu nanɔ nyuie fifia.
He didn’t want to see that.	Medi be yeakpɔ nu ma o.
We can work here.	Míate ŋu awɔ dɔ le afisia.
But it was only a few weeks.	Gake kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo koe wònye.
A gun went off.	Tu aɖe ɖi.
Have to have help there.	Ele be kpekpeɖeŋu nanɔ ame si le afima.
Someone had been really, really patient.	Ame aɖe gbɔ dzi ɖi ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ tsã.
I really don’t know.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya o.
People who don’t want another life.	Ame siwo medi agbe bubu aɖeke o.
It’s something that needs to be done.	Enye nusi wòle be woawɔ.
It’s a strange thing.	Enye nusi mewɔ nuku o.
Something seemed to be missing.	Edze abe nane bu ene.
No one was really in charge.	Ame aɖeke menɔ dɔa dzi kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I can usually count on it.	Zi geɖe la, mate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe eŋu.
To him, it’s all personal.	Le eya gbɔ la, esia katã nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
It could be anyone.	Ate ŋu anye amesiame.
In the case, it is.	Le nya la me la, ele.
Each of them took one.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe tsɔ ɖeka.
I don’t know your life.	Nyemenya wò agbe o.
These problems are about time and reality.	Kuxi siawo ku ɖe ɣeyiɣi kple nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋu.
He seemed to calm down after a while.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe ene.
Not a long time ago.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia o.
It’s a difficult issue.	Enye nya sesẽ aɖe.
You or anyone else.	Wò alo ame bubu aɖeke.
Think of it that way.	Bu eŋu nenema.
There are no strings there.	Ka aɖeke mele afima o.
I really tried.	Medze agbagba ŋutɔŋutɔ.
In a sense, it is true.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, enye nyateƒe.
And they all, like everyone else, work.	Eye wo katã, abe amesiame ene, wɔa dɔ.
Now, tell the truth.	Azɔ, gblɔ nyateƒea.
The real reason for this is obvious.	Susu ŋutɔŋutɔ si tae esia tso la dze ƒã.
Not without his help.	Menye eƒe kpekpeɖeŋu manɔmee o.
I know one thing.	Menya nu ɖeka.
Tell me this story.	Gblɔ nya sia nam.
I need you.	Mehiã wò.
Live with the living.	Nɔ agbe kple ame siwo le agbe.
Not here in the country.	Menye le afisia o.
I'll know that dress anywhere.	Manya awu ma le afi sia afi.
In fact, there was no one.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Last night.	Le zã si va yi me.
He couldn’t open his eyes at all.	Mete ŋu ʋu ŋku kura o.
There was nothing.	Naneke menɔ anyi o.
Make more rules.	Wɔ se geɖe wu.
I thought morning would work, but it hasn’t yet.	Mesusu be ŋdi awɔ dɔ, gake mewɔe haɖe o.
All of these statements are probably true.	Anɔ eme be nya siawo katã nye nyateƒe.
It happened very quickly .	Edzɔ kaba ŋutɔ .
It’s not easy, but it’s easier.	Menye nu bɔbɔe o, gake ele bɔbɔe wu.
And the night before.	Eye le zã si do ŋgɔ me.
But I’m not going to talk about that right now.	Gake nyemele nu ƒom tso nya ma ŋu fifia o.
I want to say that.	Medi be magblɔ be.
Yet, that was on his mind.	Ke hã nya ma nɔ eƒe susu me.
He didn’t get that.	Mexɔ ema o.
But the teacher can’t do it for you.	Gake nufiala la mate ŋu awɔe na wò o.
For some people.	Na ame aɖewo.
It doesn’t seem to be.	Edze abe mele nenema o ene.
There is a rule.	Se aɖe li.
Something else is at work.	Nu bubu aɖe hã le dɔ wɔm.
For once, it’s more important than money.	Zi ɖeka la, ele vevie wu ga.
He has a strong point.	Nu sesẽ aɖe le esi.
Find out exactly where they are.	Di afisi tututu wole.
Enough time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi si sɔ gbɔ va yi.
I don’t want to explain or talk about it.	Nyemedi be maɖe eme alo aƒo nu tso eŋu o.
Just like the police today.	Abe alesi kpovitɔwo le egbea ene.
In fact, it’s been almost a year.	Le nyateƒe me la, ƒe ɖeka kloe enye sia.
Life is death.	Agbe nye ku.
This might have been useful for several reasons.	Ðewohĩ esia aɖe vi le susu geɖe ta hafi.
I hope you don’t mind.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be maɖe fu na wò o.
Another drop of water.	Tsi bubu aɖe hã ge dze anyi.
In a different way.	Le mɔ bubu nu.
Not now, anyway.	Menye fifia o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
In that year.	Le ƒe ma me.
And another one after that.	Eye bubu aɖe hã le ema megbe.
The project is almost complete.	Dɔa wu enu kloe.
Everything looked like the first time.	Nusianu dze abe zi gbãtɔ ene.
In fact, I felt myself.	Le nyateƒe me la, mese le ɖokuinye me be nye ŋutɔ mese le ɖokuinye me.
People who have more, want everything.	Ame siwo si nu geɖe wu le la, di nusianu.
Not my truth.	Menye nye nyateƒea o.
I know that much.	Menya nu ma gbegbe.
And tomorrow, too.	Eye etsɔ hã.
But that’s too far, too.	Gake ema hã didi akpa.
It’s not a clear cut.	Menye nusi me kɔ nyuie o.
However, there was something else.	Ke hã, nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
His dog bit his neck.	Eƒe avu ɖu eƒe kɔ.
He never received anything.	Mexɔ naneke kpɔ o.
But many have changed.	Gake ame geɖe trɔ.
You can stay there.	Àte ŋu anɔ afima.
It’s my life, your life, everybody’s life.	Enye nye agbe, wò agbe, ame sia ame ƒe agbe.
He didn’t let her.	Meɖe mɔ nɛ o.
Names without a face.	Ŋkɔ siwo ƒe mo mele esi o.
It is a real job.	Dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖee.
I hope it will be good.	Mekpɔ mɔ be anyo.
I couldn’t do well.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nu nyuie o.
Which is very interesting.	Nusi do dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
He didn’t seem to care.	Edze abe ɖe metsɔ ɖeke le eme o ene.
Part of it was that there were so few books.	Eƒe akpa aɖee nye be agbalẽ ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ anyi.
He never really did anything to us.	Mewɔ naneke ɖe mía ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
I think there might be more to it than that.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ nu geɖe anɔ eme wu ema.
If anyone else would behave differently.	Ne ame bubu ɖesiaɖe awɔ nu le mɔ bubu nu.
Maintain ????????? 	To ?????????
Usually	Zi geɖe la .
Maybe he will in fact.	Ðewohĩ awɔe le nyateƒe me.
I’ve done it so many times.	Mewɔe zi gbɔ zi geɖe ŋutɔ.
One large building.	Xɔ gã ɖeka.
There is something for everyone here.	Nane li na amesiame le afisia.
I can’t, really.	Nyemate ŋui o, le nyateƒe me.
He was very attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
It is not a loss.	Menye nusi bu o.
That has left many people unemployed.	Ema na ame geɖe megale dɔ aɖeke wɔm o.
However, this doesn’t work for the following reason.	Ke hã, esia mewɔa dɔ le susu si gbɔna ta o.
It can be way more complicated.	Ate ŋu anye mɔ si nu sesẽ wu.
And a great one, too.	Eye gã aɖe hã.
It doesn’t look bad.	Medze nu gbegblẽ o.
Maybe you have one too.	Ðewohĩ ɖeka le asiwò hã.
But maybe another way is coming.	Gake ɖewohĩ mɔ bubu aɖe hã gbɔna.
It is important to have a clear plan.	Ele vevie be ɖoɖo si me kɔ nanɔ asiwò.
He didn’t answer her.	Meɖo nya ŋu nɛ o.
I don’t know what to do.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
That may be very difficult.	Ðewohĩ nya ma sesẽ ŋutɔ.
It was like part of him wasn’t there.	Ðeko wònɔ abe eƒe akpa aɖe mele afima o ene.
I knew it would work, and it did.	Menya be awɔ dɔ, eye wòwɔ dɔ hã.
In one night.	Le zã ɖeka me.
I think they’re fine.	Mesusu be wole nyuie.
But there are plenty of them.	Gake wo sɔ gbɔ.
Let me at least do this.	Mina mawɔ esia ya teti.
A very strange feather.	Fu aɖe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
My idea of ​​food can go anywhere.	Nye susu le nuɖuɖu ŋu ate ŋu ayi afi sia afi.
You’re not right.	Mèle eteƒe o.

These people have many children.	Vi geɖe le ame siawo si.
This is very difficult.	Esia sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I almost felt for it.	Mese le ɖokuinye me kloe le esia ta.
You do your job.	Wòe wɔa wò dɔ.
And a good point, too.	Eye nya nyui aɖe hã.
He will win.	Aɖu dzi.
He is doing a good job.	Ele dɔ nyui aɖe wɔm.
I made a mistake.	Mewɔ vodada aɖe.
A different opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe si to vovo.
It was a very small room.	Enye xɔ sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
I expected it	Mekpɔ mɔ nɛ
Now, everyone is happy.	Fifia, amesiame le dzidzɔ kpɔm.
I tried to make a phone call.	Medze agbagba be maƒo ka.
I was depressed.	Nu te ɖe dzinye.
It’s too weird.	Ewɔ nuku akpa.
I had expected the same thing.	Mekpɔ mɔ na nu ma ke tsã.
We can make space.	Míate ŋu awɔ teƒe.
None of these things existed.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Go right ahead.	Yi ŋgɔ tututu.
And the voice he had.	Eye gbe si nɔ esi.
He was interested in people.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme na amewo.
Our dog was happy the whole time.	Míaƒe avu nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm le ɣeyiɣi bliboa me.
In many ways, that is true.	Le mɔ geɖe nu la, nya ma nye nyateƒe.
It could have been a great job for him.	Ate ŋu anye dɔ gã aɖe nɛ hafi.
I will join you.	Mawɔ ɖeka kple wò.
Obviously you can tell us a bit more about it.	Edze ƒã be àte ŋu agblɔ nu geɖe tso eŋu na mí vie.
Play him a good one.	Ƒo ɖeka nyui aɖe nɛ.
Cover the face once into the night.	Kpɔ mo dzi zi ɖeka vaseɖe zã me.
I am too busy to go.	Vovo mele ŋunye akpa be mayi o.
And none of it is true.	Eye wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
I am right here for you too.	Mele afisia tututu na wò hã.
He just has no hands left.	Ðeko asi aɖeke megale esi o.
I have to read something.	Ele be madi nane.
It would take up too much space.	Axɔ teƒe geɖe akpa.
It was the strangest thing.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku wu.
There would have been a different outcome.	Anye ne nu bubu aɖe ado tso eme hafi.
I will get out of your way.	Mado le wò mɔ dzi.
It either worked or it didn’t.	Ewɔ dɔ alo mewɔ dɔ o.
In addition, you had another man.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu la, ŋutsu bubu nɔ asiwò.
But also everything else.	Gake nu bubu ɖesiaɖe hã.
I really enjoyed that part of it.	Eƒe akpa ma do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
A few of them survived.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo tsi agbe.
What this person said made no sense.	Susu aɖeke menɔ nya si ame sia gblɔ la ŋu o.
You are less than.	Èle ʋɛ wu.
He put his hand to his mouth.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ɖo eƒe nu gbɔ.
There is no problem with that.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ema ŋu o.
I just want to see his face.	Ðeko medi be makpɔ eƒe mo.
We only knew each other for one day.	Gbe ɖeka koe míenya mía nɔewo.
Think of someone who is like you, but not you.	Bu ame aɖe si le abe wò ene ŋu kpɔ, gake menye wòe o.
Which is a very long time.	Nusi nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
Just by being far enough away from them.	To wo didi tso wo gbɔ ale gbegbe me ko.
I had a completely different side in mind.	Akpa si to vovo kura nɔ susu me nam.
The logic is pretty simple.	Susu si le eme la le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
If you are anyone else, you can contact me there as well.	Ne ènye ame bubu aɖe la, àte ŋu aƒo ka nam le afima hã.
There was nothing in it.	Naneke menɔ eme o.
He didn’t know what else to do.	Menya nu bubu si wòawɔ o.
Can't anyone beat us.	Ðe ame aɖeke mate ŋu aƒo mí oa.
In fact, he didn’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
Please help us!.	Taflatse kpe ɖe mía ŋu!.
We can’t talk to him.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu nɛ o.
Everything was going so well.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie ale gbegbe.
Run if you can.	Du ne àte ŋui.
I have established a strong reputation in my field.	Meɖo ŋkɔ sesẽ aɖe anyi le nye dɔa me.

Also the wind stopped.	Azɔ hã ya la tɔ.
It can be very false.	Ate ŋu anye alakpa ŋutɔ.
That is certainly possible.	Ema ate ŋu adzɔ godoo.
There was no one thing.	Nu ɖeka aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
It’s a great thing.	Enye nu gã aɖe.
However, this works to our advantage.	Ke hã, esia wɔa dɔ ɖe vi na mí.

You can work where and when you want.	Àte ŋu awɔ dɔ le afisi nèdi kple ɣeyiɣi si nèdi.
We had adequate food.	Nuɖuɖu siwo sɔ nɔ mía si.
The king ruled for many years.	Fia la ɖu dzi ƒe geɖe.

There may be more to it than that.	Ðewohĩ nu geɖe anɔ eme wu ema.
Anyone can do it.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu awɔe.
He seems to be waiting for something.	Edze abe ele nane lalam ene.
Nenema is the one.	Nenema ke le ta.
And so far it’s working well.	Eye vaseɖe fifia la, ele dɔ wɔm nyuie.
I let them go.	Meɖe asi le wo ŋu.
I’ve never seen anything like that in my life.	Nyemekpɔ naneke nenema le nye agbe me kpɔ o.
This could be a big deal.	Esia ate ŋu anye nu gã aɖe.
I already knew that too.	Nye hã menya ema xoxo.
There is no one there.	Ame aɖeke mele afima o.
Police found two missing vehicles.	Kpovitɔwo ke ɖe ʋu eve siwo bu ŋu.
Summer was waning.	Dzomeŋɔli nɔ to yim.
It’s a good thing, not a bad thing.	Enye nu nyui aɖe, ke menye nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
Perhaps it is.	Ðewohĩ ele nenema.

There is no other possibility.	Nu bubu aɖeke meli si ate ŋu adzɔ o.
Everywhere else seems to be now.	Edze abe teƒe bubu ɖesiaɖe le fifia ene.

Just, here you are.	Ðeko, wòe nye esi.
We missed out on so much.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ to mía ŋu.
The police held them back.	Kpovitɔwo lé wo ɖe te.
He was an illiterate man.	Enye ŋutsu si menya agbalẽ o.
Something really, really, really bad.	Nane si gblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
They need to act together.	Ehiã be woawɔ nu ɖekae.
He wouldn’t want to live.	Madi be yeanɔ agbe o.
Tell me more about this city.	Gblɔ nu geɖe nam tso du sia ŋu.
It, too, is obvious.	Eya hã, edze ƒã.
His face changed.	Eƒe mo trɔ.
I am very happy with the result.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ɖe nusi do tso eme ŋu.
And now you.	Eye fifia wò.
They had him.	Eya nɔ wo si.

But everything went wrong.	Gake nusianu meva yi nyuie o.
Which almost happened to me.	Nusi dzɔ ɖe dzinye kloe.
I saw two horses there.	Mekpɔ sɔ eve le afima.
Something happened in his mind.	Nane dzɔ le eƒe susu me.
He wasn’t busy at all.	Vovo menɔ eŋu kura o.
And now listen to the.	Eye azɔ ɖo to.

For you, for me, for everyone here.	Na wò, nam, na amesiame le afisia.
You can do it, too.	Wò hã àte ŋui.

Great house with lots of room.	Aƒe gã aɖe si me xɔ geɖe le.
But he has a reason.	Gake susu aɖe le esi.
Almost nothing seemed to surprise him.	Edze abe naneke kloe mewɔ nuku nɛ o ene.
Until things went wrong.	Vaseɖe esime nuwo va gblẽ.

Things have changed.	Nuwo trɔ.
But it would be good for the two of us.	Gake anyo na mí ame eve.
I worked for years on this project.	Mewɔ dɔ ƒe geɖe le dɔ sia ŋu.
He was definitely not one of us.	Menye mía dometɔ ɖekae wònye o godoo.
Since we’re all here anyway.	Esi wònye be mí katã míele afisia le mɔ sia mɔ nu ta la.
You have to be united.	Ele be nàwɔ ɖeka.
That’s what did it.	Emae wɔe.
But I can do it.	Gake mate ŋui.
He was so clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ale gbegbe.
Again, it’s not true.	Azɔ hã, menye nyateƒe o.
You can come along.	Àte ŋu ava.
I got to find a 'way out of here for myself.	Mekpɔ mɔ akpɔ ‘mɔ tso afisia na ɖokuinye.’
And here you have them.	Eye kpɔ ɖa, wole asiwò.
There were quite a few of them.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ nɔ anyi.
Many died this first winter.	Ame geɖe ku le dzomeŋɔli gbãtɔ sia me.
I always worked.	Mewɔa dɔ ɣesiaɣi.
Take some time for it.	Di ɣeyiɣi aɖe ɖe eŋu.
But before that, nothing.	Gake do ŋgɔ na ema la, naneke meli o.
He had no plans to go anywhere.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo aɖeke be yeayi afi aɖeke o.
The apartment is a great one.	Xɔa nye xɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
His house is very expensive.	Eƒe aƒea xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
No one did anything.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ naneke o.
It looks really good.	Edze nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.

Maybe someone else did.	Ðewohĩ ame bubu aɖe hã wɔe nenema.
I don’t know anything about you.	Nyemenya naneke tso ŋuwò o.
Things can definitely get contagious.	Nuwo ate ŋu axɔ ame me godoo.
They have to work.	Ele be woawɔ dɔ.
We can still move forward quickly.	Míate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ kaba kokoko.
He had a lot of help.	Kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe nɔ esi.
And it’s not exactly true either.	Eye menye nyateƒe tututu hã o.
Usually my dog ​​is over that early though.	Zi geɖe la, nye avu wu enu nenema kaba gake.

No one was anywhere nearby.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afi aɖeke si te ɖe eŋu o.
Several circumstances illustrate this point.	Nɔnɔme geɖe na nya sia me kɔ.
This is very important.	Esia le vevie ŋutɔ.
There is no problem there.	Kuxi aɖeke mele afima o.
But he was different, too.	Gake eya hã to vovo.
Who lives in that house over there?	Amekae le aƒe ma me le afima?
I hope he does that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔe nenema.
I could be wrong. 	Mate ŋu anye vodada.

And it kind of happened that way.	Eye edzɔ nenema le mɔ aɖe nu.
It’s been a year.	Ƒe ɖeka enye sia.
He won’t do it.	Mawɔe o.
What works for one person may not work for another.	Ðewohĩ nusi wɔa dɔ na ame ɖeka mawɔ dɔ na ame bubu o.

I hope you enjoyed my work.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nye dɔa do dzidzɔ na mi.
He couldn't, not in this case.	Mete ŋui o, menye le go sia me o.
No time for that right now.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli na ema fifia o.
But the building remained the same.	Gake xɔa gakpɔtɔ nɔ nenema.

You are doing well.	Èle edzi dzem nyuie.
I hope you can save it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu aɖee.
He still has plenty of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe gakpɔtɔ le esi.
Alcohol had damaged him for a long time.	Aha sesẽ gblẽ nu le eŋu ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
A very big loss.	Nu gã aɖe si bu ŋutɔ.
And this works.	Eye esia wɔa dɔ.
This year everything changed.	Le ƒe sia me la, nusianu trɔ.
He didn’t care about anything.	Metsɔ ɖeke le naneke me o.
It’s just as hard.	Sesẽ nenema ke.
One of them is the heart.	Wo dometɔ ɖekae nye dzi.
I couldn’t figure out what he was doing.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi wɔm wònɔ la ŋu o.

None of them had ever lived here.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ afisia kpɔ o.

I thought he was going to buy you breakfast.	Mesusu be ele ŋdi nuɖuɖu ƒle ge na wò.
It was a big hole.	Do gã aɖee wònye.
This isn’t surprising.	Esia mewɔ nuku o.

Clearly something is wrong here.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ le afisia.
I was kind of happy.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ le mɔ aɖe nu.
I don’t feel like a lot of people have.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be ame geɖe mese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ o.

She was so excited!	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ!
But it is still possible.	Gake anya wɔ kokoko.
Otherwise, you shouldn't have much to say.	Ne menye nenema o la, mele be nya geɖe nanɔ asiwò o.
He never did and he never will.	Mewɔe kpɔ o eye mawɔe hã gbeɖe o.
That means a lot.	Ema fia nu geɖe.

It’s a good job.	Enye dɔ nyui aɖe.
Good morning!	Ŋdi!
One last point.	Nya mamlɛtɔ ɖeka.
It seems at this point to be redundant.	Edze abe le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, enye nusi mehiã o ene.
I am a nice guy who is having a hard time.	Nyee nye ŋutsu nyui aɖe si le nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe me tom.

And it’s pretty simple, really.	Eye ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
In real time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ŋutɔŋutɔ me.
That’s my job.	Emae nye nye dɔ.
If you don’t mind me coming with you.	Ne meɖe fu na wò be mava kpli wò o.

And it didn’t do a very good job.	Eye mewɔ dɔ nyui aɖeke kura o.
It will come true for him.	Ava eme nɛ.
I could never work that one out myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mate ŋu awɔ dɔ le ɖeka ma ŋu gbeɖe o.
Anything would be better than this.	Nusianu anyo wu esia.
Not against him.	Menye ɖe eŋu o.
No one had ever done this to him.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ nu sia ɖe eŋu kpɔ o.
Everyone has been out.	Amesiame do go kpɔ.
In a real book.	Le agbalẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe me.
He was a kind of king.	Enye fia ƒomevi aɖe.
I don’t want to do it now.	Nyemedi be mawɔe fifia o.
Please get help.	Taflatse xɔ kpekpeɖeŋu.
The car was speeding.	Ʋua nɔ du dzi sesĩe.
After all, you are the first.	Le nyateƒe me la, wòe nye ame gbãtɔ.
There was a small fire.	Dzo sue aɖe nɔ afima.
In a good order.	Le ɖoɖo nyui nu.
He would go no further with her.	Mayi ŋgɔ wu ema kplii o.
It doesn’t matter, really.	Mehiã o, le nyateƒe me.
There isn’t much in it.	Nu geɖe mele eme o.
I have to in a way.	Ele nam le mɔ aɖe nu.
Now change real time.	Azɔ trɔ ɣeyiɣi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
None of them said anything.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
But it can’t happen.	Gake mate ŋu adzɔ o.
He couldn’t meet my eye.	Mete ŋu do go nye ŋku o.
I was nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe.
I don’t know who you are.	Nyemenya ame si nènye o.
Some situations are clear.	Nɔnɔme aɖewo me kɔ.
Probably a lot of them.	Ðewohĩ wo dometɔ geɖe ŋutɔ.
And that’s better than anything anyone else does.	Eye ema nyo wu nusianu si ame bubu aɖe awɔ.
He had a clear voice.	Gbe si me kɔ nyuie nɔ esi.
There is something else going on here.	Nu bubu aɖe hã le edzi yim le afisia.
He is no longer alive.	Megale agbe me o.
In two parts.	Le akpa eve me.
In the meantime.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la.
Hope you are doing great.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be èle nu gã aɖe wɔm.
There is no one in our room.	Ame aɖeke mele míaƒe xɔa me o.
You’re fine, too.	Wò hã èle nyuie.
And this has happened in the past.	Eye esia dzɔ va yi.
A house can last a thousand years.	Aƒe aɖe ate ŋu anɔ anyi ƒe akpe ɖeka.
Maybe too often.	Ðewohĩ zi geɖe akpa.
And yet, he couldn’t let go.	Eye ke hã, mete ŋu ɖe asi le eŋu o.
I couldn’t stand it.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
I am just another part of life for these people.	Agbe ƒe akpa bubu aɖe koe menye na ame siawo.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Naneke mate ŋu anɔ ŋgɔ wu nyateƒea o.
That didn’t go over well.	Ema meva yi nyuie o.
That doesn’t seem so bad.	Ema medze abe nu gbegblẽ nenema gbegbe o ene.
And you are the first.	Eye wòe nye gbãtɔ.
This seems unlikely.	Edze abe esia mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.

You have to do what you have to do.	Ele be nàwɔ nu si wòle be nàwɔ.
We don’t know much about what’s going on.	Míenya nu geɖe tso nusi le edzi yim ŋu o.
Enter the room.	Ge ɖe xɔa me.
You can’t do it.	Màte ŋu awɔe o.
After that, the.	Le ema megbe la.
It is not the opposite.	Menye nusi to vovo na emae wònye o.
That bullet saved his life.	Tu ma xɔ eƒe agbe.
Maybe I started it.	Ðewohĩ nyee dze egɔme.
Each of these places is different.	Teƒe siawo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
I will briefly discuss it here.	Maƒo nu tso eŋu kpuie le afisia.
There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eme o.
He didn’t have time before, but he will now.	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ esi tsã o, gake anɔ esi fifia.
Keep things simple.	Na nuwo nanɔ bɔbɔe.
Machine more than anything else.	Mɔ̃ wu nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
There was another person in the room.	Ame bubu aɖe hã nɔ xɔa me.
We had some really good people there.	Ame nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖewo nɔ mía si le afima.
No help will be forthcoming, trust me on that.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke mava o, ka ɖe dzinye le ema dzi.
I think some of them may still be going on.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ wo dometɔ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ le edzi yim kokoko.
That seems really weird.	Ema dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.

And over and over again.	Eye zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
As long as we are familiar with this issue.	Zi alesi míenya nu tso nya sia ŋu nyuie ko.
There is almost nothing to do.	Naneke meli woawɔ o kloe.

One of them is.	Wo dometɔ ɖekae nye.
It’s not that simple.	Menye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
This is impossible to do.	Esia mate ŋu awɔ o.
Please pass the salt.	Taflatse to dze la ŋu.
Life is very precious.	Agbe xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I want to stay on top of this.	Medi be manɔ esia dzi.
And the location.	Eye teƒe si wòle.
It would have never occurred to me.	Anye ne mava susu me nam gbeɖe o.

He didn’t think he could fight one.	Mesusu be yeate ŋu awɔ avu kple ɖeka o.

And he didn’t do that.	Eye mewɔe nenema o.
I still can’t figure out what the thing is.	Nyemete ŋu nya nusi nu la nye haɖe o.
I don’t have my car yet, but I will definitely test this out.	Nye ʋu mele asinye haɖe o, gake mado esia kpɔ godoo.
There is no one here.	Ame aɖeke mele afisia o.
He couldn't believe what he was seeing.	Meka ɖe nusi kpɔm wònɔ dzi o.
Which one is right?	Kae sɔ?
Maybe this is a first.	Ðewohĩ esia nye gbãtɔ.
I really wanted to do that.	Medi vevie be mawɔe nenema.
Which makes a lot of sense, actually.	Nusi me susu le ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
I’m not the only loser.	Menye nye ɖeka koe nye ame si bu o.
It’s a bad thing.	Enye nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
They were obviously very excited.	Edze ƒã be dzi dzɔ wo ŋutɔ.
I gave him a head.	Metsɔ ta aɖe nɛ.
This sounds like another guy.	Esia ɖi ŋutsu bubu aɖe.
Add to this thread.	Kpe ɖe ka sia ŋu.

He was not there this morning.	Menɔ afima ŋdi sia o.

In fact, there is nothing.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke mele eme o.
But that didn’t last very long.	Gake ema menɔ anyi eteƒe didi boo o.
In short, he didn’t care.	Kpuie ko la, metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
That shouldn’t surprise anyone.	Mele be ema nawɔ nuku na ame aɖeke o.
I came out here so much.	Medo go le afisia ale gbegbe.

Doing a lot of work.	Dɔ geɖe wɔwɔ.
She had a man with her.	Ŋutsu aɖe nɔ esi kplii.

It’s been good to me.	Ewɔ nyui nam.
Nice to get to know you better.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be meva nya wò nyuie wu.
Any night would be great.	Zã ɖesiaɖe anyo ŋutɔ.
But you can eliminate some things.	Gake àte ŋu aɖe nu aɖewo ɖa.
But take this.	Gake xɔ esia.
They are going to use you.	Wole wò zã ge.
In front of them was a dilapidated building.	Xɔ aɖe si gblẽ la nɔ wo ŋgɔ.

Since it is a project.	Esi wònye dɔ aɖee wònye.
Now let me explain more clearly.	Azɔ mina maɖe eme nyuie wu.
But things didn’t quite work out that well.	Gake nuwo meva yi nyuie nenema tututu o.
Police are looking for that man.	Kpovitɔwo le ŋutsu ma dim.
It was a huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖee wònye.
But it’s another thing to make them.	Gake enye nu bubu be woawɔ wo.
His death was a great loss.	Eƒe ku nye nu gã aɖe si bu nɛ.
It may or may not ever come.	Ðewohĩ ava alo mava gbeɖe o.
The exact opposite of me.	Nusi tsi tre ɖe ŋunye tututu.
In short, nothing can ever be the easy way out.	Kpuie ko la, naneke mate ŋu anye mɔ bɔbɔe la gbeɖe o.
It was the right thing for him.	Enye nusi sɔ nɛ.
He had a lot of money and nothing to do.	Ga geɖe nɔ esi eye naneke meli wòawɔ o.
Who lives next door?	Amekae le aƒe si te ɖe afima ŋu?
None of us knew where we were going.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke menya afi si yim míele o.
That’s more than simple.	Ema de ŋgɔ wu nu bɔbɔe aɖe ko.
Complete them at your discretion.	Wu wo nu le wò didi nu.
It’s just a matter of convenience.	Ðeko wònye nusi sɔ ƒe nya.

You are expecting too much.	Èle mɔ kpɔm na nu geɖe akpa.
There are a lot of these guys out there too.	Ŋutsu siawo dometɔ geɖe le afima hã.
I can't find this design anywhere.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ aɖaŋu sia le afi aɖeke o.
And he has it.	Eye wòle esi.
He needs someone like you.	Ehiã ame aɖe abe wò ene.
Nobody told me that.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya ma nam o.
This is nothing new out there.	Esia menye nu yeye le afima o.
But it won’t always be the case.	Gake manɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi o.
And in this case.	Eye le go sia me la.
It’s not very complicated.	Menye nusi me kɔ boo o.
But there is something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã li.
It can’t be good.	Mate ŋu anyo o.
That’s a great thing.	Nu gã aɖee nye ema.
I'm going to get sick.	Mele dɔ lé ge.
Get your hands on the new devices.	Wɔ asi na mɔ̃ yeye siwo le lãme na ame la.
It doesn’t really act like one either.	Mewɔa nu abe ɖeka ene ŋutɔŋutɔ hã o.
When my heart stopped, time seemed to stop too.	Esi nye dzi tɔ la, edze abe ɣeyiɣi hã tɔ te ene.
We don’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele mía si o.
It was obviously someone else.	Edze ƒã be ame bubu aɖee.
A lot of things happened.	Nu geɖe dzɔ.
This surprised him.	Nya sia wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
In part because it was.	Le akpa aɖe me la, esi wònɔ nenema.
His name will live in infamy.	Eƒe ŋkɔ anɔ agbe le ŋkɔ gbegblẽ me.
This is not worth it.	Esia medze o.
It can take a lot of dogs.	Ate ŋu axɔ avu geɖe.
That angered the group.	Ema do dziku na ha la.
I wanted to do something a little different.	Medi be mawɔ nane si to vovo vie.
But that is over now.	Gake ema wu enu fifia.
There is a reason for this.	Susu le esia me.
Something was wrong with that guy.	Nane gblẽ le ŋutsu ma ŋu.
There is a damage to it.	Nu gblẽ le eŋu.
It's great that he's right here.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ be ele afisia tututu.

I found one of them.	Meke ɖe wo dometɔ ɖeka ŋu.
No one would fight like that.	Ame aɖeke mawɔ avu nenema o.
This name came up.	Ŋkɔ sia va do.
If that happens, the long word is obvious.	Ne edzɔ alea la, nya didi la dze ƒã.
I have nothing to say.	Nya aɖeke mele asinye o.
Its really personal preference.	Eƒe ame ŋutɔ ƒe didi ŋutɔŋutɔ.

Life is easy.	Agbe le bɔbɔe.
These problems have caused much concern	Kuxi siawo na ame geɖe tsi dzi

That’s part of what really surprised me about it.	Ema nye nusi wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ le eŋu la ƒe akpa aɖe.
A project is currently underway.	Dɔ aɖe le edzi yim fifia.
There were thousands of them.	Wo dometɔ akpe geɖe nɔ anyi.
And so did he.	Eye eya hã.
My heart told me something was wrong.	Nye dzi gblɔ nam be nane gblẽ.
This is no longer the case.	Esia megale alea o.
The strangest thing happened yesterday.	Nu si wɔ nuku wu la dzɔ etsɔ.
I don’t understand why it wouldn’t work.	Nyemese nusita mawɔ dɔ o gɔme o.
That it’s a bad thing.	Be enye nu gbegblẽ.
It doesn’t matter.	Mele vevie o.
Everything happened by itself.	Nusianu dzɔ le eɖokui si.
This year is one of them.	Ƒe sia nye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
No one will ever see them.	Ame aɖeke makpɔ wo gbeɖe o.
Get in the car.	Ge ɖe ʋua me.
Enough of the flour! 	Wɔ sɔ gbɔ!
I am in a predicament like many.	Mele nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe me abe ame geɖe ene.
the teacher said.	nufiala la gblɔ.
Not these people here.	Menye ame siawo le afisia o.
I'll talk you through it.	Maƒo nu na wò to eme.
He couldn't remember the dog's name.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku avu la ƒe ŋkɔ dzi o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He was a strong and stable man.	Enye ame sesẽ aɖe si li ke.
I don’t want reality.	Nyemedi be nu ŋutɔŋutɔ nanɔ anyi o.
Neither of us said anything.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Little more can be done now.	Nu boo aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ wu ema o fifia.
They were arrested by the police.	Kpovitɔwo lé wo.
I hope it helps me.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be akpe ɖe ŋunye.
There were many rooms in the house.	Xɔ geɖe nɔ aƒea me.
Let the big man sit for a while.	Na ame gã la nanɔ anyi vie.
And the water was rising.	Eye tsi la nɔ dzi yim.
That could be it.	Ema ate ŋu anye.
You don’t have to do anything.	Mehiã be nàwɔ naneke o.
That was years ago.	Ema nye ƒe geɖe enye sia.
Each for his own.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe na eya ŋutɔ tɔ.
Now he never will.	Fifia mawɔe gbeɖe o.
It all just kind of happened.	Ðeko wo katã dzɔ le mɔ aɖe nu.
I really needed them.	Mehiã wo ŋutɔ.
He cannot allow that.	Mate ŋu aɖe mɔ nenema o.
And if you missed them, you can still find them right here.	Eye ne wo to ŋuwò la, àte ŋu akpɔ wo le afisia tututu kokoko.
You can easily see that further.	Àte ŋu akpɔ ema ayi ŋgɔ wu ema bɔbɔe wu.
He put his head in it.	Etsɔ eƒe ta de eme.
I said he had to join you.	Megblɔ be ele be wòawɔ ɖeka kple wò.
It is very important to us.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ na mí.
There wasn’t much in that.	Nu geɖe menɔ ema me o.
Also, you know.	Azɔ hã, ènya.
A car is coming down the road.	Ʋu aɖe le mɔ dzi gbɔna.
This quest is a bit of a no-brainer.	Didi sia nye nusi me susu mele o vie.
But you may not be in that position.	Gake ɖewohĩ mèle nɔnɔme ma me o.
The first is in it.	Gbãtɔ le eme.
Continue.	Yi edzi.
I refused to back down.	Megbe ɖe megbe.
The police are responding.	Kpovitɔwo le nu wɔm ɖe eŋu.
I hope he can find a job soon.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ate ŋu akpɔ dɔ kpuie.
He didn’t trust this man.	Meka ɖe ŋutsu sia dzi o.
He liked it so much.	Edze eŋu ale gbegbe.
I am here and you are there.	Mele afisia eye wò hã èle afima.
I got that.	Mexɔ ema.
That’s just the truth.	Nyateƒe si le eme koe nye ema.
But it is possible.	Gake anya wɔ.
I need you there.	Mehiã wò le afima.
I got them back.	Nyee xɔ wo ake.
Another area of ​​the head.	Ta ƒe teƒe bubu.
He did that there.	Ewɔ nu ma le afima.
Vain desire again.	Didi vevie si ŋu naneke mele o ake.
You can get out of here tomorrow.	Àte ŋu ado le afisia etsɔ.
It was a very great day.	Enye ŋkeke gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But we’re not going anywhere.	Gake míele afi aɖeke yim o.
I really am the king.	Nyee nye fia la ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We are ready for this.	Míele klalo na esia.
I understand it now.	Mese egɔme fifia.
The same is true of the same.	Nenema ke wòle nenema ke.
You are treating me tonight.	Èle nu wɔm ɖe dzinye le zã sia me.
Everything was in order.	Nusianu nɔ ɖoɖo nu.
That was last month.	Ema nye ɣleti si va yi.
Check this place out tomorrow.	Kpɔ teƒe sia ɖa etsɔ.
He had his way with it.	Eƒe mɔ nɔ esi kplii.
In fact, he may be the only one.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ eya ɖeka koe.
Just talk, you say.	Ƒo nu ko, ègblɔ.
And he has two hands and a short head.	Eye eƒe asi eve kple ta ɖeka le kpuie.
Not sure about it yet.	Meka ɖe edzi le eŋu haɖe o.
I can tell you it was a job.	Mate ŋu agblɔ na mi be dɔ aɖee.
But there was never anyone else in the car.	Gake ame bubu aɖeke menɔ ʋua me kpɔ o.
I actually made a plan to act.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ be mawɔ nu.
Maybe no one knows.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖeke menya o.
I still don’t know what kind, or where.	Nyemenya nusi ƒomevi wònye haɖe o, alo afikae o.
He had another problem of his own.	Kuxi bubu aɖe hã nɔ eya ŋutɔ ŋu.
Which makes me question.	Nusi na mebiaa nya.
That took four months.	Ema xɔ ɣleti ene.
Start this today.	Dze esia gɔme egbea.
It’s what everyone thinks.	Enye nusi amesiame susu.
Perhaps at another time.	Ðewohĩ le ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖe me.
Fee in the money.	Fe le ga me.
I used to feel it.	Mese le ɖokuinye me tsã.
No one can hear.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu ase nu o.
He planned it well.	Ewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu nyuie.
I need fresh air.	Mehiã ya nyui.
I think it’s you.	Mesusu be wòe.
But I doubt that’s one of us.	Gake meke ɖi be mía dometɔ ɖekae nye ema.
I'm pretty sure you can't give anything away.	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ be màte ŋu ana naneke o.
That would be a good thing.	Ema anye nu nyui aɖe.
The truth at last.	Nyateƒea mlɔeba.
So much for being up for things.	Ale gbegbe be wole dzi ƒom ɖe nuwo ŋu ta.
As long as people don’t work it out.	Zi alesi amewo mewɔ dɔ tso eŋu o ko.
You have two years.	Ƒe eve le asiwò.
He didn’t ask for it.	Mebia tso ame si o.
That’s all there is to it.	Ema koe nye ema.
Only one person in the house would do that.	Ame ɖeka koe awɔ ema le aƒea me.
I would love to have one.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ne ɖeka nanɔ asinye.
That can be a problem.	Ema ate ŋu anye kuxi.
He had never stayed up all night with anyone.	Metsi zã bliboa kple ame aɖeke kpɔ o.
But not like many more complicated things.	Gake menye abe nu geɖe siwo sesẽ wu ene o.
But he wasn’t worried.	Gake metsi dzi o.
I needed that.	Mehiã ema.
In that year.	Le ƒe ma me.
You can only imagine what that was like.	Àte ŋu akpɔ alesi ema nɔ le susu me ko.
This is not an easy matter.	Esia menye nya bɔbɔe o.
Come here in here.	Va afisia le afisia.
He too was in good shape.	Eya hã ƒe nɔnɔme nɔ nyuie.
See what you have against it.	Kpɔ nusi le asiwò ɖe eŋu ɖa.
You know that’s impossible.	Ènya be ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I was very happy to do the same.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ be mawɔ nenema ke.
It makes sense.	Susu le eme.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
His voice rose.	Eƒe gbe dzi ɖe edzi.
It’s just that way.	Ðeko wòle nenema.
Now I want to make one big point.	Fifia medi be magblɔ nya gã ɖeka.
It is certainly possible.	Ate ŋu adzɔ godoo.
Other precedents are not quite consistent.	Nu bubu siwo do ŋgɔ la mewɔ ɖeka tututu o.
He had no time to react.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ esi wòawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu o.
That was very exciting for us.	Ema do dzidzɔ na mí ŋutɔ.
That’s what he wants.	Emae nye eƒe didi.
We were surprised that it could happen.	Ewɔ nuku na mí be ate ŋu adzɔ.
It couldn’t have worked.	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ hafi o.
You knew that beforehand.	Ènya nya ma do ŋgɔ.
Thank you very much again.	Akpe geɖe na wò ake.
You need to be fucked.	Ehiã be woawɔ fu wò.
He certainly didn’t.	Mewɔe nenema o godoo.
I have to be fine.	Ele be manɔ nyuie.
That took hours and hours.	Ema xɔ gaƒoƒo kple gaƒoƒo geɖe.
This is all there is to it.	Esia koe nye esia.
We only have today.	Egbea koe le mía si.
Actually, for that is nobody.	Le nyateƒe me la, na be menye ame aɖeke o.
In my face.	Le nye mo me.
And pretty much everything in between.	Eye nusianu kloe si le wo dome.
Tell me what happened.	Gblɔ nu si dzɔ la nam.
There for a long time.	Le afima ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
His face was a severe statement.	Eƒe mo nye nya sesẽ.
It was an old car.	Ʋu xoxo aɖee wònye.
I’m not looking for them.	Nyemele wo dim o.
We can work separately.	Míate ŋu awɔ dɔ ɖe vovo.
I stayed there for a week one night.	Menɔ afima kwasiɖa ɖeka le zã aɖe me.
I'll let him go.	Maɖe asi le eŋu.
I am trying really hard.	Mele agbagba dzem vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But there wasn’t one.	Gake ɖeke menɔ anyi o.
There is little he can do.	Nu sue aɖe koe wòate ŋu awɔ.
He is here with us in this room.	Ele afisia kpli mí le xɔ sia me.
This was a long time ago now.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia fifia.
This requires action.	Esia bia be woawɔ nane.
It’s a really hard thing to do.	Enye nu sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ be woawɔ.
We know what that looks like.	Míenya alesi ema le.
And now or never.	Eye fifia alo gbeɖe o.
To do whatever is right for you.	Be nàwɔ nusianu si sɔ na wò.
I want to do better.	Medi be mawɔ nu nyuie wu.
It’s pretty easy that way.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ le mɔ ma nu.
You have no heart.	Dzi aɖeke mele asiwò o.
The atmosphere in that room was amazing.	Nɔnɔme si nɔ xɔ ma me la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
In fact, no one can.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame aɖeke mate ŋui o.
I was too interested.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme akpa.
In the past month.	Le ɣleti si va yi me.
We can stay here.	Míate ŋu anɔ afisia.
I can’t believe this.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ esia dzi ase o.
That’s an idea.	Ema nye susu aɖe.
But it’s a good idea.	Gake susu nyui aɖee.
It will take a long time.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
Find the dog.	Di avu la.
This is a difficult situation to achieve.	Esia nye nɔnɔme si gbɔ ɖoɖo sesẽ.
I needed something that made sense.	Mehiã nane si me susu le.
A few days later, he too died.	Le ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo megbe la, eya hã ku.
This is not the place to do that.	Esia menye teƒe si woawɔ nu ma le o.
He had no reason to be surprised.	Susu aɖeke menɔ esi si ta wòawɔ nuku nɛ o.
I couldn’t work.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ dɔ o.
I do this at home.	Mewɔa esia le aƒeme.
I never felt that way about anyone else.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema le ame bubu aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o.
He didn’t listen.	Meɖo to o.
There is a tooth in it.	Aɖu aɖe le eme.
Like anything you want.	Abe nusianu si nèdi ene.
There is nothing else in it.	Nu bubu aɖeke mele eme o.
That’s my life.	Emae nye nye agbe.
Getting in was so easy.	Ge ɖe eme nɔ bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
One way or the other.	Mɔ ɖeka alo bubu.
And the gun, too.	Eye tu la hã.
To a fact after heard go quickly for him.	To nyateƒe aɖe megbe se yi kaba na eya.
Take care of them.	Lé be na wo.
He had an angry voice.	Gbe si me dziku le nɔ esi.
There was no space.	Teƒe aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
The King welcomed us.	Fia la xɔ mí nyuie.
You’re the one.	Wòe nye esi.
More than enough is enough.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ wu esi sɔ gbɔ.
That is a real possibility.	Ema nye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s just kind of.	Ðeko wònye ƒomevi aɖe.
Which is part of my point.	Nusi nye nye nya la ƒe akpa aɖe.
Please throw this away.	Taflatse tsɔ esia ƒu gbe.
I don’t know where we are.	Nyemenya afi si míele o.
Its a very good idea.	Eƒe susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
The overall situation is excellent.	Nɔnɔme bliboa nyo ŋutɔ.
I have to go quickly.	Ele be mayi kaba.
I was ready for this.	Menɔ klalo na esia.
We are going to have another child.	Míele vi bubu aɖe dzi ge.
But I really wasn’t happy.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
Come on.	Eya ko.
That would make more sense.	Susu anɔ nya ma me wu.
A few weeks passed.	Kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo va yi.
How to communicate with him.	Ale si woawɔ aɖo dze kplii.
No one else could have known.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu anya hafi o.
This does not seem to be the case.	Edze abe esia mele alea o ene.
I was concerned about this too.	Metsi dzi ɖe esia hã ŋu.
It’s a reasonable idea.	Enye susu si me susu le.
And that’s for a great reason.	Eye esia le susu gã aɖe ta.
Yet there is another problem that has resulted.	Ke hã kuxi bubu aɖe hã li si do tso eme.
This person is dead.	Ame sia ku.
Eat.	Ɖu.
But maybe it will be.	Gake ɖewohĩ anɔ eme.
Press it hard.	Zi edzi sesĩe.
Thousands lost their jobs.	Ame akpe geɖe ƒe dɔ ge le wo si.
Something about this water didn’t feel like water.	Nane si le tsi sia ŋu mese le eɖokui me abe tsi ene o.
It never was and never will be.	Menɔ anyi kpɔ o eye manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
Look inside, no one there, nothing.	Kpɔ eme, ame aɖeke mele afima o, naneke mele afima o.
There is nothing good about it.	Naneke meli si nyo le eŋu o.
I wish you everything.	Mele nusianu dim na wò.
This is very clear.	Esia me kɔ ŋutɔ.
I know things.	Menya nuwo.
We are well-informed.	Míenye ame siwo nya nu nyuie.
However, all is well which ends well.	Ke hã, nuwo katã le nyuie si wu enu nyuie.
I had food in my possession.	Nuɖuɖu nɔ asinye.
It might be very expensive.	Ðewohĩ axɔ asi ŋutɔ.
. . . .	.
I didn’t hear that.	Nyemese nya ma o.
None of us had ever seen anything like it.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
That’s not quite so simple.	Ema mele bɔbɔe tututu nenema gbegbe o.
I always managed to make a few bucks.	Mete ŋu kpɔa ga ʋɛ aɖewo ɣesiaɣi.
The body is not dim.	Mele ga la dim.
On at least one occasion.	Le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka ya teti me.
An idea struck him.	Susu aɖe va dze edzi nɛ.
How did he get this job?	Aleke wòwɔ va kpɔ dɔ sia?
For some reason it is not working.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, mele dɔ wɔm o.
All it takes is two parts.	Nusi hiã koe nye akpa eve.
There is no one better than me.	Ame aɖeke meli si nyo wu nye o.
You are important.	Èle vevie.
Tom wanted a new job.	Tom di dɔ yeye aɖe.
It is, of course, quite the opposite.	Enye nusi to vovo kura ya.
But that doesn’t matter much.	Gake ema mehiã boo o.
If anything, what went wrong?	Ne nane li la, nukae gblẽ?
But there was a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖe nɔ anyi.
Thanks again for a good job.	Akpe ake ɖe dɔ nyui si nèwɔ ta.
He didn't seem to know what impressed him.	Edze abe menya nusi wɔ dɔ ɖe edzi o ene.
This is for the following reason.	Susu si gbɔna tae wòle alea ɖo.
This is totally appropriate.	Esia sɔ kura.
Someone explained.	Ame aɖe ɖe eme.
A really tough time, actually.	Ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
Everyone was going about their lives.	Amesiame nɔ eƒe agbe dzi yim.
Or something that sounds normal.	Alo nane si ɖi nusi sɔ.
Without water there is no life.	Tsi manɔmee la, agbe aɖeke meli o.
It seems too simple.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe akpa ene.
I never saw one, you know.	Nyemekpɔ ɖeka kpɔ o, ènya.
I set it up too soon, maybe.	Meɖoe anyi kaba akpa, ɖewohĩ.
It was one bad shot.	Enye tu gbegblẽ ɖeka.
In fact, quite the opposite is true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo kura na emae nye nyateƒe.
Some joined us for only a few months.	Ame aɖewo va kpe ɖe mía ŋu ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
Something that is sick.	Nu aɖe si dze dɔ.
Just think how different this is.	Bu alesi esia to vovo na nusi nɔ anyi tsã ŋu kpɔ ko.
He couldn’t work.	Mete ŋu wɔ dɔ o.
This is his business, of course.	Esia nye eƒe nya ya.
This worked quite well.	Esia wɔ dɔ nyuie kura.
He can’t quite do it.	Mate ŋu awɔe tututu o.
There was a stone there.	Kpe aɖe nɔ afima.
Throughout the year, things happened.	Le ƒe bliboa me la, nuwo dzɔ.
Look around the room.	Lé ŋku ɖe xɔa me godoo.
Fire in our house.	Dzo le míaƒe aƒea me.
Consider the following two statements.	Bu nya eve siwo gbɔna ŋu kpɔ.
He had incredible hands.	Asi siwo mewɔ nuku o nɔ esi.
The car stopped suddenly.	Ʋua tɔ zi ɖeka.
I think something is missing somewhere for whatever reason.	Mesusu be nane bu le afi aɖe le susu ka ke ta o.
There is much work to be done.	Dɔ geɖe li woawɔ.
He had a name for himself.	Ŋkɔ aɖe nɔ esi.
I looked around for sure.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe nu ŋu godoo.
That happened in this case.	Ema dzɔ le nya sia me.
He did not know how to deal with that truth.	Menya alesi wòawɔ nu ɖe ​​nyateƒe ma ŋu o.
This house is so famous.	Aƒe sia xɔ ŋkɔ ale gbegbe.
Sweat was on his face.	Fifia nɔ eƒe mo.
What can we do about this?	Nu kae míate ŋu awɔ tso esia ŋu?
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
But this doesn’t have to be the case.	Gake mehiã be esia nanɔ nenema o.
That’s really what this place is for.	Ema tae teƒe sia le ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But not like a fire.	Gake menye abe dzo ene o.
There are a few other things that are needed.	Nu bubu ʋɛ aɖewo hã li siwo hiã.
I know what the truth is.	Menya nusi nye nyateƒea.
I still had two.	Ame eve gakpɔtɔ nɔ asinye.
You are in my house.	Èle nye aƒe me.
There were some problems.	Kuxi aɖewo nɔ anyi.
It was always impossible.	Enye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o ɣesiaɣi.
Something or someone.	Nane alo ame aɖe.
But that path never materialized.	Gake mɔ ma meva eme gbeɖe o.
There is no one to help me.	Ame aɖeke meli akpe ɖe ŋunye o.
They are in for a surprise.	Wole nusi awɔ nuku na wo la me.
Now there were only a few, one or two.	Fifia la, wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ anyi, ɖeka alo eve.
I can go with that.	Mate ŋu ayi kple ema.
A really big deal.	Nu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is not necessarily true without this condition.	Esia menye nyateƒe kokoko nɔnɔme sia manɔmee o.
Her head turned under his hand.	Eƒe ta trɔ le eƒe asi te.
I really enjoyed my time there.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ le ɣeyiɣi si metsɔ nɔ afima.
It won’t come in here.	Mava ge ɖe afisia o.

Look at this and this and this and this.	Kpɔ esia kple esia kple esia kple esia ɖa.
There is another one.	Bubu aɖe hã li.
Please live for a few more days.	Taflatse nɔ agbe ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo ko.

I couldn’t understand this.	Nyemete ŋu se esia gɔme o.
His opportunity was there.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ si nɔ esi la nɔ afima.
There is nothing coming.	Naneke meli si gbɔna o.
I don’t know if that’s an accurate statement.	Nyemenya ne nya ma nye nya si sɔ o.
It doesn’t look good to me.	Medze nam nyuie o.
Maybe he couldn’t.	Ðewohĩ mete ŋui o.
We are here for one reason.	Nu ɖeka tae míele afisia ɖo.
I was making good money.	Menɔ ga nyui kpɔm.
The last night of his life.	Eƒe agbe me zã mamlɛtɔ.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
That appeals to me.	Ema dzɔa dzi nam.
He can only say one thing.	Nya ɖeka koe wòate ŋu agblɔ.
That opportunity arrived.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ ma va ɖo.
But he had done more than that.	Gake ewɔ nu geɖe wu ema tsã.
I have a job for you.	Dɔ aɖe le asinye na wò.
He had no time for us at all anyway.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ esi na mí kura o le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
It’s part of all of them.	Wo katã ƒe akpa aɖee.
But it is something.	Gake enye nane.
I had to get out of it.	Ele be mado le eme.
We can handle that.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ.
They are in plain error.	Wole vodada si dze ƒã me.
This is all there is.	Esia koe li.
Everyone can make mistakes.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu awɔ vodada.
Some of us may not.	Ðewohĩ mía dometɔ aɖewo mawɔe nenema o.
I turned out to be right.	Meva dzɔ be nye nya le eteƒe.
That seems pretty advanced.	Edze abe ema de ŋgɔ ŋutɔ ene.
Yet every man is different.	Ke hã ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
There is only one problem.	Kuxi ɖeka koe li.
But he didn’t understand it until morning.	Gake mese egɔme o vaseɖe ŋdi.
Your house is so far away.	Wò aƒea didi ale gbegbe.
Nothing.	Naneke o.
He has a heart and none better.	Dzi le esi eye ɖeke meli si nyo wu ema o.
It started out this way.	Edze egɔme le mɔ sia nu.
There were no negative consequences.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖeke medo tso eme o.
Act like a man.	Wɔ nu abe ŋutsu ene.
But he is really under the gun.	Gake ele tu la te ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I’m not going anywhere right now.	Nyemele afi aɖeke yim fifia o.
It’s actually a hole.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye do aɖe.
This can go on for hours yet.	Esia ate ŋu ayi edzi gaƒoƒo geɖe haɖe.
This obviously doesn’t work.	Edze ƒã be esia mewɔa dɔ o.
I actually liked it better.	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ dzi nam wu.
This city is a real place.	Du sia nye teƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ.

This one couldn’t run, that one quit.	Ame sia mete ŋu ƒu du o, ɖeka ma dzudzɔ.
You can’t get much better than that.	Màte ŋu akpɔ nusi nyo wu ema boo o.
Now it is not so.	Fifia mele nenema o.
In you I went.	Le wò me yi.
That guy’s back.	Ŋutsu ma ƒe megbe.
He threw himself away.	Etsɔ eɖokui ƒu gbe.
He wouldn’t make that mistake.	Mawɔ vodada nenema o.
This building still exists.	Xɔ sia gakpɔtɔ li.
Now and now and now, exactly what is here.	Fifia kple fifia kple fifia, nusi tututu le afisia.
There is still plenty of room for error.	Vodada ƒe mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ li.
Sure.	Ka ɖe edzi.
And we would have less money to organize.	Eye anye ne ga sue aɖe koe anɔ mía si be míawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe nu ŋu.
He seemed so calm.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme ale gbegbe ene.
It’s not an exaggeration.	Menye nusi gbɔ eme o.
Bad bad bad bad.	Nu gbegblẽ gbegblẽ nu gbegblẽ.
No one had ever come with him.	Ame aɖeke meva kplii kpɔ o.
I am making a search.	Mele didi aɖe wɔm.
He didn’t show up.	Meɖe eɖokui fia o.
It’s only been a year.	Ƒe ɖeka koe nye esia.
But there is absolutely nothing we can do.	Gake naneke kura meli míate ŋu awɔ o.
But not now, not like this.	Gake menye fifia o, menye alea o.
No one knew how to react.	Ame aɖeke menya ale si wòawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu o.
But that was never his way.	Gake ema menye eƒe mɔ gbeɖe o.
Great finish on that one.	Gã wu enu le ɖeka ma dzi.
Or, you know, really quickly.	Alo, ènya, kaba ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Think about it, if you can.	Bu eŋu kpɔ, ne àte ŋui.
Be careful with that.	Kpɔ nyuie le ema ŋu.
He seemed surprised.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ ene.
Everyone needs a car today!	Amesiame hiã ʋu egbea!
In that city.	Le du ma me.
As of now, everything seems to be working.	Le fifia nu la, edze abe nusianu le dɔ wɔm ene.
If it can be of any use.	Nenye be ate ŋu aɖe vi aɖe.
There is nothing big.	Nu gã aɖeke meli o.
Adi is going to go.	Adi be yeayi.
I think there is one thing.	Mesusu be nu ɖeka aɖe li.
Run away from it.	Si le eŋu.
However, let go of it.	Ke hã, ɖe asi le eŋu.
These devices do a lot of good work.	Mɔ̃ siawo wɔa dɔ nyui geɖe.
This is a favorite part of her.	Esia nye akpa aɖe si dzɔa dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
Not exactly true.	Menye nyateƒe tututu o.
I was nervous though.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ya.
Many people did two jobs.	Ame geɖe wɔ dɔ eve.
And it’s amazing.	Eye wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
One of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka.
But it won’t work.	Gake maɖe vi o.

We’re not ready for that yet.	Míele klalo na ema haɖe o.
I apologize for everything.	Meɖe kuku ɖe nusianu ta.
This was really too easy.	Esia nɔ bɔbɔe akpa ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This city has found itself in a bad way,	Du sia kpɔ eɖokui le mɔ gbegblẽ dzi, .
He didn’t care about me.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam o.
Give four feet a chance.	Na mɔnukpɔkpɔ afɔ ene.
That is hard work.	Ema nye dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ.
This guy wasn’t going anywhere.	Ŋutsu sia menɔ afi aɖeke yim o.
Where this is concerned, look more closely.	Afisi esia le la, lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie wu.
A year has passed.	Ƒe ɖeka va yi.
It’s not that easy.	Mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
We can’t stay here.	Míate ŋu anɔ afisia o.
There’s more where that comes from, always.	Nu geɖe wu li afisi ema tso, ɣesiaɣi.
Pay me now.	Fe nam fifia.
I would be fine overnight.	Manɔ nyuie le zã ɖeka me.
Maybe someone had a personal issue with them.	Ðewohĩ ame ŋutɔ ƒe nya aɖe si nɔ ame aɖe ŋu ɖe wo ŋu.
Many people believe in him.	Ame geɖe xɔ edzi se.
You’re choking him.	Èle eƒe lãme ƒom.
I'm still waiting for that.	Megale ema lalam kokoko.
It wouldn’t bother me at all.	Maɖe fu nam kura o.
This was very easy to do.	Esia wɔwɔ nɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I want to deal with the opposite.	Medi be makpɔ nusi to vovo na ema gbɔ.
But the result was the same.	Gake nu ma ke do tso eme.
I think it’s true.	Mesusu be enye nyateƒe.
Four hours each time.	Gaƒoƒo ene ɣesiaɣi.
Now we only have time, money, and space.	Fifia ɣeyiɣi, ga, kple teƒe koe le mía si.
Please seek help.	Taflatse di kpekpeɖeŋu.
Please make an appointment.	Taflatse, wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ɣeyiɣi aɖe ŋu.
That just doesn’t work.	Ðeko ema mewɔa dɔ o.
He never told the truth.	Megblɔ nyateƒea kpɔ o.
One can do this for quite some time.	Ame ate ŋu awɔ esia ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe vie.
To be able to see.	Be wòate ŋu akpɔ nu.
None of them had anything all that appealing.	Naneke si ƒe nu lé dzi na ame nenema gbegbe menɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke si o.
There was another man there.	Ŋutsu bubu aɖe hã nɔ afima.
But nothing came to mind.	Gake naneke meva susu me nɛ o.
It doesn’t matter here.	Mehiã le afisia o.
I think that’s fair.	Mesusu be nya ma sɔ.
Everyone is different.	Ame sia ame to vovo.
I intend to try you, here and now.	Meɖoe be mate wò kpɔ, le afisia kple fifia.
Or, really, everyone.	Alo, le nyateƒe me la, amesiame.
But there is something else there.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã le afima.
But there is no other way.	Gake mɔ bubu aɖeke meli o.
But not today.	Gake menye egbea o.
Everyone knows what it’s like.	Amesiame nya alesi wòle.
Not until after the meeting.	Menye le kpekpea megbe hafi o.
I am too busy to sit here.	Vovo mele ŋunye akpa be manɔ anyi ɖe afisia o.
Nothing came out against him.	Naneke medo go ɖe eŋu o.
He didn’t get angry.	Medo dziku o.
However, that is an idea.	Ke hã, susu aɖee nye ema.
I saw you talking to that guy.	Mekpɔ wò le nu ƒom kple ŋutsu ma.
Now you are a man.	Fifia ènye ŋutsu.
I grew up too soon.	Metsi kaba akpa.
So far that has worked for me.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ema wɔ dɔ nam.
And that’s what we’re fighting for.	Eye nu ma tae míele avu wɔm ɖo.
I am a person.	Ame aɖee menye.
Hold on a little bit.	Lé ɖe asi vie.
It was like everyone used to work in the same room.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe amesiame wɔa dɔ le xɔ ɖeka me tsã ene.
He wasn’t happy, but he didn’t say anything.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ o, gake megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
But it doesn’t work the other way around.	Gake mewɔa dɔ le mɔ bubu nu o.
That’s not very surprising.	Ema mewɔ nuku boo aɖeke o.
You can’t do anything.	Màte ŋu awɔ naneke o.
Let it work.	Na wòawɔ dɔ.
There is plenty of room for you!.	Teƒe geɖe li na wò!.
That appealed to him.	Ema dzɔ dzi nɛ.
Who said what.	Amekae gblɔ nya kae.
If there is one.	Ne ɖe li la.
I can’t stand this anymore.	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi le esia me azɔ o.
But please check who is in charge.	Gake taflatse lé ŋku ɖe amesi le dɔa dzi kpɔm ŋu.
But we have to work too hard right now.	Gake ele be míawɔ dɔ sesĩe akpa fifia.
He is going through a lot.	Ele nu geɖe me tom.
None of them seem to work.	Edze abe wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔa dɔ o ene.
But he was a good guy.	Gake enye ame nyui aɖe.
He didn’t have a bad time.	Ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ aɖeke menɔ esi o.
And you’re right.	Eye wò nya le eteƒe.
Keep my thread short.	Na nye ka la nanɔ kpuie.
This here is a mistake.	Esia le afisia nye vodada.
I hope you are home and more comfortable than ever.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be èle aƒeme eye wò dzi dze eme wu tsã.
This is simply not the case.	Ðeko esia mele nenema o.
I had never heard of it.	Nyemese eŋu nya kpɔ o.
This is definitely a problem.	Esia nye kuxi godoo.
But we are together now.	Gake míele ɖekae fifia.
But promise me this.	Gake do esia ƒe ŋugbe nam.
It’s fresh and new.	Enye nu yeye eye wònye yeye.
Many of them still exist.	Wo dometɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ li.
This is not obvious at all.	Esia medze ƒã kura o.
I would have understood.	Anye ne mese egɔme hafi.
Do come inside.	Do va ge ɖe eme.
There is a good point here too.	Nya nyui aɖe le afisia hã.
It’s amazing, isn’t it?	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, alo?
That would be great.	Ema anyo ŋutɔ.
Probably a lot of things.	Ðewohĩ nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
However, there may be none.	Ke hã, ate ŋu anye be ɖeke meli o.
This is very clear.	Esia me kɔ ŋutɔ.
Many projects may not work.	Ðewohĩ dɔ geɖe mawɔ dɔ o.
I’m not like anyone else here.	Nyemele abe ame aɖeke ene le afisia o.
This seems quite absurd to me.	Esia dze nam abe nusi me susu mele kura o ene.
Or it happened at the same time.	Alo edzɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me.
Close to many things.	Te ɖe nu geɖe ŋu.
Its my hard work.	Eƒe nye dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This may be true, and it may not be.	Esia ate ŋu anye nyateƒe, eye ɖewohĩ manɔ nenema o.
I couldn’t get to do it.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ mɔ awɔe o.
These people are sick.	Ame siawo dze dɔ.
I have to keep talking.	Ele be manɔ nu ƒom.
This device can operate underwater.	Mɔ̃ sia te ŋu wɔa dɔ le tsi te.
It’s like this guy is only tonight.	Ele abe zã sia me koe ŋutsu sia le ene.
Something is wrong here.	Nane gblẽ le afisia.
And maybe never.	Eye ɖewohĩ gbeɖe o.
It will do a great job.	Awɔ dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
In fact, things are quite different.	Le nyateƒe me la, nuwo to vovo kura.
The smoke cleared.	Dzudzɔ la kɔ.
Onward and upward.	Yi ŋgɔ kple yi dzi.
I told you that before.	Megblɔ nya ma na mi do ŋgɔ.
And for me, too.	Eye na nye hã.
However, things are not so easy today.	Ke hã, nuwo mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe egbea o.
You don’t have to do anything more.	Mehiã be nàwɔ naneke wu ema o.
Maybe that’s not such a bad thing.	Ðewohĩ ema menye nu gbegblẽ nenema gbegbe o.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
The word came out.	Nya la do go.
I couldn’t talk or anything.	Nyemete ŋu ƒoa nu alo naneke o.
I had to become like him.	Ele be mava nɔ abe eya ene.
Not a good one, a great one.	Menye nyui aɖeke o, gã aɖee.
If you’re tired, you can’t do that.	Ne ɖeɖi te ŋuwò la, màte ŋu awɔ ema o.
I understand it now.	Mese egɔme fifia.
This is not right or proper.	Esia menye nusi sɔ alo sɔ o.
It never stayed with him.	Metsi anyi nɛ kpɔ o.
Just maybe this will actually work.	Ðeko ɖewohĩ esia awɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The police are here.	Kpovitɔwo le afisia.
It’s definitely worked out great for us.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ na mí godoo.
They will be ashamed.	Ŋu akpe wo.
I am at a loss.	Mele nusi bu me.
He doesn't know how he got there.	Menya alesi wòwɔ va ɖo afima o.
He lives alone in a big house.	Eya ɖeka koe le aƒe gã aɖe me.
Only one of them works.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka koe wɔa dɔ.
It’s a great job.	Dɔ gã aɖee.
It’s worth it.	Edze eŋu.
This place is amazing.	Teƒe sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
You know you can do this again and again.	Ènya be yeate ŋu awɔ esia zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
At this point and over time, you can make a mistake.	Le teƒe sia kple le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe la, àte ŋu awɔ vodada.
And it’s part of it.	Eye wònye eƒe akpa aɖe.
Nothing was bothering him.	Naneke menɔ fu ɖem nɛ o.
He wasn't ready, he wasn't ready.	Menɔ klalo o, menɔ klalo o.
But you can’t go on like that.	Gake màte ŋu ayi edzi anɔ nenema o.
People are just like you.	Amewo le abe wò ene.
He took another.	Etsɔ bubu.
I was just worried about you.	Ðeko metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò.
But something else happened.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã dzɔ.
They are in this situation.	Wole nɔnɔme sia me.
He couldn’t wait.	Mete ŋu nɔ lalam o.
What a sight.	Nu kae nye si.
This made me happy.	Esia do dzidzɔ nam.
I can actually relax here.	Le nyateƒe me la, mate ŋu aɖe dzi ɖi le afisia.
If only that were possible.	Ne ɖe ema anya wɔ la, anye ne anya dzɔ.
It happened here.	Edzɔ le afisia.
Yet he will not turn a blind eye.	Ke hã maɖe ŋku ɖa o.
I shouldn’t have come to work today.	Mele be mava dɔme egbea hafi o.
That’s all life has ever been.	Ema koe nye agbe si li kpɔ.
I understand now, of course.	Mese egɔme fifia ya.
Think about what you would really like.	Bu nu si adzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋu kpɔ.
It’s not, yet anyway.	Menye nenema o, ke hã le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I shouldn’t have said anything.	Mele be magblɔ nya aɖeke hafi o.
He had to hurry.	Ele nɛ be wòawɔ kaba.
He lived only here.	Afi sia koe nɔ agbe.
I am his everything.	Nyee nye eƒe nusianu.
I am going to try really hard starting today.	Mele agbagba dzem vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ tso egbea dzi.
But that ended with, though.	Gake ema wu enu kple, gake.
I have an idea of ​​what we can do.	Susu aɖe le asinye le nusi míate ŋu awɔ ŋu.
It’s the life of a dog.	Enye avu ƒe agbe.
That’s not normal.	Ema menye nusi sɔ o.
We can communicate better.	Míate ŋu aɖo dze nyuie wu.
But inside!!.	Gake le eme!!.
If he can.	Ne ate ŋui la.
I'm just waiting.	Ðeko mele lalam.
Maybe there will be.	Ðewohĩ anɔ anyi.
He has been a teacher in quite a few schools.	Ewɔ nufiala le suku ʋɛ aɖewo ko me.
He enjoyed his work very much.	Eƒe dɔa do dzidzɔ nɛ ŋutɔ.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Do your job.	Wɔ wò dɔ.
I knew he would do that.	Menya be awɔe nenema.
Or any other man.	Alo ŋutsu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
Once a month .	Zi ɖeka ɣleti sia ɣleti .
Work on it.	Wɔ dɔ le eŋu.
That was very exciting.	Ema do dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
I have to put up with it.	Ele be mado dzi le eŋu.
His work is twofold.	Eƒe dɔa nye nu eve.
None of them exist here.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meli le afisia o.
But people do that.	Gake amewo wɔa nu ma.
I can’t remember anything else.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nu bubu aɖeke dzi o.
Leave things as they are.	Gblẽ nuwo ɖi abe alesi wole ene.
And that seems right.	Eye edze abe nya ma sɔ ene.
You can make two statements.	Àte ŋu awɔ nya eve.
It is working very well.	Ele dɔ wɔm nyuie ŋutɔ.
The privileged can live a higher standard of living.	Ame siwo si mɔnukpɔkpɔ le ate ŋu anɔ agbe si de ŋgɔ wu.
I had always looked forward to this day.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na ŋkeke sia ɣesiaɣi.
Or through it.	Alo to edzi.
You can try it.	Àte ŋu ate kpɔ.
I couldn’t double book without him.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ agbalẽ zi gbɔ zi eve eya manɔmee o.
I just want to get out of here.	Ðeko medi be mado le afisia.
It didn’t come any closer.	Mete ɖe ŋunye wu nenema o.
He is now one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖekae wònye fifia.
Here he had no work.	Le afisia la, dɔ aɖeke menɔ esi o.
The work has its price.	Dɔa ƒe asi le eŋu.
Not to save myself.	Menye be maɖe ɖokuinye o.
The same is true here.	Nenema ke le afisia hã.
This usually ends badly.	Zi geɖe la, esia wu enu gbegblẽ.
For me, they used to be.	Le nye ta la, wole nenema tsã.
I really liked the house.	Aƒea dze ŋunye ŋutɔ.
It may never be that way.	Ðewohĩ manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
Write this down.	Ŋlɔ nya sia ɖi.
But that’s your problem, of course.	Gake emae nye wò kuxi ya.
I just wanted to act on it.	Ðeko medi be mawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu.
There must be a better way!	Ele be mɔ si nyo wu nanɔ anyi!
It might be more.	Ðewohĩ anye nu geɖe wu.
His mind touched a lot.	Eƒe susu ka nu geɖe.
I need to talk to him.	Ele be maƒo nu kplii.
Anyone who touches it will answer me.	Ame sia ame si ka asi eŋu la, aɖo eŋu nam.
His face was, anyway.	Eƒe mo nɔ, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I look exactly like him.	Medze abe eya tututu ene.
Check it out here.	Kpɔ afisia ɖa.
He just sat there.	Ðeko wònɔ anyi ɖe afima.
This building is just not compliant.	Ðeko xɔ sia mewɔ ɖeka kple se o.
He probably didn’t really know anyone there.	Anɔ eme be menya ame aɖeke ŋutɔŋutɔ le afima o.
Tell me where you are.	Gblɔ afi si nèle nam.
It doesn’t seem to matter.	Edze abe mele vevie o ene.

It has never been like that.	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o.
I'll see you in the morning.	Makpɔ wò le ŋdi me.
I didn’t like this book.	Agbalẽ sia medze ŋunye o.
But we have none today of that quality.	Gake ɖeke mele mía si egbea si ƒe nɔnɔme le nenema o.
We can help them a little.	Míate ŋu akpe ɖe wo ŋu vie.
Hopefully, it will be.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be, anɔ nenema.
A gun or something.	Tu alo nane.
But maybe that’s okay.	Gake ɖewohĩ ema nyo.
I want to try that today.	Medi be mate ema kpɔ egbea.
However, that doesn’t work.	Ke hã, ema mewɔa dɔ o.
I am sure it would have been very interesting.	Meka ɖe edzi be anye ne adzɔ dzi na ame ŋutɔ.
It’s just money.	Ga koe wònye.
But it never bothered you.	Gake meɖe fu na wò gbeɖe o.
I felt very angry.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be medo dziku vevie.
In fact, he wasn’t there.	Le nyateƒe me la, menɔ afima o.
This was very appealing to me.	Esia dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I hope it goes well.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ayi edzi nyuie.
Go to school.	Ayi suku.
I have plenty of space.	Teƒe geɖe le asinye.
Anyone can do any job.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu awɔ dɔ ɖesiaɖe.
Not so bad though.	Menye nu gbegblẽ nenema gbegbe o ke hã.
I’m a very new person.	Me nye ame yeye ŋutɔ.
He didn’t feel comfortable with anyone or anything.	Mese le eɖokui me be yeƒe dzi dze eme le ame aɖeke alo naneke ŋu o.
That’s just you.	Wò koe nye ema.
It can save your life.	Ate ŋu axɔ na wò agbe.
We know very little about him.	Nu sue aɖe koe míenya tso eŋu.
It doesn’t work, for someone else.	Mewɔa dɔ o, na ame bubu.
Reality is rarely that simple.	Ƒã hafi nu ŋutɔŋutɔ nɔa bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe.
The money is part of something that belongs to him.	Ga la nye nane si nye eya ŋutɔ tɔ ƒe akpa aɖe.
He had a job now, a proper job.	Dɔ aɖe nɔ esi fifia, dɔ si sɔ.
Enjoy.	Kpɔ dzidzɔ nyuie.
Stand behind him.	Tsi tre ɖe megbe nɛ.
You can be anything you want.	Àte ŋu anye nusianu si nèdi.
And nothing can ever top that.	Eye naneke mate ŋu aƒo esia ta gbeɖe o.
And now we’re going to give it to you separately.	Eye fifia míele etsɔ ge na mi ɖe vovo.
Honor the king.	De bubu fia la ŋu.
He had a very independent mind.	Susu si le eɖokui si ŋutɔ nɔ esi.
We can never do it.	Míate ŋui gbeɖe o.
Go up a little bit.	Yi dzi vie.
Write like there is no tomorrow.	Ŋlɔ abe etsɔ aɖeke meli o ene.
He has no place here now because of her.	Teƒe aɖeke mele esi le afisia fifia le eya ta o.
It’s just what you have to do.	Nusi wòle be nàwɔ koe wònye.
That’s the first rule for us.	Emae nye se gbãtɔ na mí.
Everything still works.	Nusianu gakpɔtɔ le dɔ wɔm.

A small cottage by a lake.	Aƒe sue aɖe si le ta aɖe to.
No one refused.	Ame aɖeke megbe o.
Right now, that’s my mindset.	Fifia la, emae nye nye susu.
It was just too true.	Nyateƒe akpa koe wònye.

I couldn’t put them together.	Nyemete ŋu ƒo wo nu ƒu o.

In addition, there are many men to work with.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu la, ŋutsu geɖe li woawɔ dɔ kplii.

Only you can do that.	Wò ɖeka koe ate ŋu awɔ ema.

But please, in the meantime, let me do my job.	Gake taflatse, le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, na mawɔ nye dɔ.

You can always talk to him.	Àte ŋu aƒo nu kplii ɣesiaɣi.
He had only one dress.	Awu ɖeka koe nɔ esi.
In fact, it is one.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye ɖeka.
Clearly, this is not true at all.	Edze ƒã be esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
But this is good.	Gake esia nyo.
No one had ever done that before.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ nu ma kpɔ o.

It can take time.	Ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi.

I probably wouldn’t have anything to do with it either.	Anye be nye hã mawɔ naneke le eŋu o.

I can’t be here with you.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afi sia kpli wò o.
He was new, about a month into the job.	Enye ame yeye, abe ɣleti ɖeka ene le dɔa me.
Life is very, very good!.	Agbe nyo ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ!.
And believe me, this work has to be done.	Eye xɔ dzinye se, ele be woawɔ dɔ sia.
He would have nothing now.	Naneke manɔ esi fifia o.
It’s a whole new thing.	Enye nu yeye aɖe ŋutɔ.
That’s really your kind.	Ema nye wò ƒomevi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Always in fact.	Ɣesiaɣi le nyateƒe me.
Yet he couldn’t be quite sure.	Ke hã mete ŋu ka ɖe edzi tututu o.
It’s impossible for me to do either.	Manya wɔ nam be mawɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
You can find one like this, man.	Àte ŋu akpɔ ɖeka abe esia ene, ŋutsu.
I want to live.	Medi be manɔ agbe.
Perhaps he did too.	Ðewohĩ eya hã wɔe nenema.
No one else will do it.	Ame bubu aɖeke mawɔe o.
It was a great place.	Teƒe gã aɖee wònye.
The room is so tight now.	Xɔa me sesẽ ale gbegbe fifia.
This surprised him.	Nya sia wɔ nuku nɛ.
And you are, too.	Eye wò hã nèle.
Start with that, and that’s all.	Dze egɔme kple ema, eye ema koe.
I can’t explain it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eme o.
When the truth comes out, he will understand.	Ne nyateƒea do la, ase egɔme.
Still, this part of the job can be fun.	Ke hã, dɔa ƒe akpa sia ate ŋu ado dzidzɔ na ame.
Everyone should work from that.	Ele be amesiame nawɔ dɔ tso ema me.
I’m single, you know.	Nyee nye tre, ènya.
I know what is right and what is true.	Menya nu si le eteƒe kple nu si nye nyateƒe.
When things go well, there is nothing like it.	Ne nuwo yi edzi nyuie la, naneke meli si sɔ kplii o.
It just can’t be true.	Ðeko mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
That guy doesn’t know his job.	Ŋutsu ma menya eƒe dɔ o.
But it wasn’t too late.	Gake metsi megbe akpa o.
He’s had enough and he’s going to get over his life.	Eƒe nu sɔ gbɔ eye wòle eƒe agbe dzi ɖu ge.
This is one for me.	Esia nye ɖeka nam.
They had another issue in mind.	Nya bubu aɖe hã nɔ susu me na wo.
These kinds of things.	Nu siawo ƒomevi.
He would have come.	Anye ne ava.
A new house.	Aƒe yeye aɖe.
I want to say we know what to do.	Medi be magblɔ be míenya nusi míawɔ.
The interviewer asked inappropriate questions.	Ame si bia gbe amewo la bia nya siwo medze o.
Now there is a problem.	Fifia kuxi aɖe li.
To do with my own work.	Be mawɔ kple nye ŋutɔ nye dɔ.
You have to tell the truth.	Ele be nàgblɔ nyateƒea.
He lives alone in a large house by the lake.	Eya ɖeka koe le aƒe gã aɖe me le ta la to.
Live a better life.	Nɔ agbe si nyo wu.
And the work paid off.	Eye dɔa ɖe vi.
Things could be better.	Nuwo ate ŋu anyo.
In the end, he succeeded.	Mlɔeba la, edze edzi.
I was never sure what he would do with this.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi wòawɔ kple esia dzi gbeɖe o.
Something needs to be done about that too.	Ele be woawɔ nane tso ema hã ŋu.
This would be a huge challenge.	Esia anye kuxi gã aɖe.
I am not short of reach.	Mele kpuie le afisi mate ŋu aɖo o.
This is a system that has worked well for me.	Esia nye ɖoɖo aɖe si wɔ dɔ nyuie nam.
He seemed unsatisfied.	Edze abe eƒe dzi medze eme o ene.
I tried something with this but it's not working.	Mete nane kpɔ kple esia gake mele dɔ wɔm o.
Tomorrow will be our last day here.	Etsɔ anye míaƒe ŋkeke mamlɛtɔ le afisia.
I just need a few things.	Mehiã nu ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
Not personal, of course.	Menye ame ŋutɔ tɔ ya o.
I think you’re working.	Mesusu be èle dɔ wɔm.
Finally, it started a few days later.	Mlɔeba la, edze egɔme le ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo megbe.
Get up, stand up.	Tso, tsi tre.
Maybe this will go well after all.	Ðewohĩ esia ayi edzi nyuie le nuwo katã megbe.
But few exceptions though.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe to vovo na ema gake.
And another, older one, of another man.	Eye bubu, si tsi wu, si nye ŋutsu bubu tɔ.
We never really knew who he was.	Míenya amesi tututu wònye gbeɖe o.
And maybe a little angry.	Eye ɖewohĩ ado dziku vie.
He couldn’t do it.	Mete ŋu wɔe o.
I have something on someone else.	Nane le asinye le ame bubu dzi.
But he couldn’t run.	Gake mete ŋu ƒu du o.
Now he himself is dead.	Fifia eya ŋutɔ ku.
That would be	Ema anye .
I had fun this week.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ le kwasiɖa sia me.
It didn’t bother him much.	Meɖe fu nɛ boo o.
I missed something.	Nane to ŋunye.
But it's probably active now.	Gake anɔ eme be ele dɔ dzi fifia.
This is a very big day for you.	Esia nye ŋkeke gã aɖe ŋutɔ na wò.
He couldn't stop now.	Mete ŋu tɔ te fifia o.
This is important for two reasons.	Esia le vevie le susu eve ta.
I cannot tell you what the word means.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi nya la fia na mi o.
He just couldn’t get over it.	Ðeko mete ŋu ɖu dzi le eŋu o.
I had very happy horses this morning.	Sɔ siwo kpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ la nɔ asinye ŋdi sia.
Now, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.	Fifia, míate ŋu awɔ esia le mɔ bɔbɔe alo mɔ sesẽ nu.
You can find this here.	Àte ŋu akpɔ esia le afisia.
That’s what you want.	Emae nèdi.
At this hour he cannot eat.	Le gaƒoƒo sia me la, mate ŋu aɖu nu o.
It won’t be useful.	Maɖe vi o.
To some extent, this is true.	Vaseɖe afi aɖe la, esia nye nyateƒe.
It was a good time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe.
Hopefully that’s just me.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be nye ɖeka koe nye ema.
It’s been some difficult.	Ewɔ sesẽ aɖewo.
We have to be united.	Ele be míawɔ ɖeka.
It’s a really nice place.	Enye teƒe nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s not what I want.	Menye emae medi o.
That’s nothing.	Ema menye naneke o.
But this scenario is a bit different.	Gake nɔnɔme sia to vovo vie.
Never makes any small sense.	Susu le sue aɖe me gbeɖe o.
Which could be for a number of reasons.	Nusi ate ŋu anye le susu geɖe ta.
And that’s why he had no chance.	Eye esia tae mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke menɔ esi o ɖo.
Things are not easy for me right now.	Nuwo mele bɔbɔe nam fifia o.
I know some people were looking for that.	Menya be ame aɖewo nɔ ema dim.
I told him the truth.	Megblɔ nyateƒea nɛ.
He almost certainly would have seen this.	Anye ne akpɔ esia godoo kloe hafi.
It worked really well for me.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie nam ŋutɔ.
The house is badly damaged.	Aƒea me gblẽ vevie.

It was a good day.	Enye ŋkeke nyui aɖe.
I have been waiting to do it for a long time.	Mele lalam be mawɔe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
A week ago, no one had heard of him.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia la, ame aɖeke mese eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
I can't figure out why it's not working.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusita mele dɔ wɔm o la gɔme o.
It’s a good idea, actually.	Enye susu nyui aɖe, le nyateƒe me.
He has no problem with it.	Kuxi aɖeke mele eŋu kplii o.
He couldn’t see things very clearly.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nuwo nyuie ŋutɔ o.
About two months ago, she fell in love with him.	Anɔ abe ɣleti eve enye sia ene la, eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
I couldn’t bear to think about them.	Nyemete ŋu do dzi le wo ŋu bubu me o.
I’m so glad I was able to talk to someone.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mete ŋu ƒo nu kple ame aɖe.
I put you through it now.	Metsɔ wò to eme fifia.
There was so much he didn’t know.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi si menya o.
It’s a normal thing.	Enye nusi sɔ.
You have enough time.	Ɣeyiɣi si sɔ gbɔ le asiwò.
We can’t say anything.	Míate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke o.
It will be the same here.	Anɔ nenema le afisia.
Everyone lived like this.	Ame sia ame nɔ agbe alea.
He couldn’t get enough books.	Mete ŋu xɔ agbalẽ siwo sɔ gbɔ o.
Do whatever you want there.	Wɔ nusianu si nèdi le afima.
The dress is very nice.	Awu la nyo ŋutɔ.
He was a really nice guy.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Something like this and that.	Nane si le abe esia kple esia ene.
There are many possibilities.	Nu geɖe li siwo ate ŋu adzɔ.
He had to do it all himself.	Ele be eya ŋutɔ nawɔ wo katã.
It seems completely impossible.	Edze abe manya wɔ kura o ene.
Just more lies.	Alakpa geɖe wu ko.
I hope this is useful.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia aɖe vi.
An old building caught fire.	Xɔ xoxo aɖe xɔ dzo.
He cannot walk on his own.	Mate ŋu azɔ le eɖokui si o.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
That might have been the first time.	Ðewohĩ emae nye zi gbãtɔ hafi.
I had to do something.	Ele be mawɔ nane.
But, this is nothing new.	Gake, esia menye nu yeye o.
In front of my mouth.	Le nye nu ŋgɔ.
No one really knows much about it.	Ame aɖeke menya nu geɖe tso eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
It was my first time out there.	Enye zi gbãtɔ si medo go le afima.
But that doesn’t matter.	Gake ema mele vevie o.
It’s the same thing every year.	Enye nu ɖeka ma ke ƒe sia ƒe.
This year we will unite.	Le ƒe sia me la, míawɔ ɖeka.
It was a great building.	Enye xɔ gã aɖe.
And and and and.	Eye kple kple.
And it didn’t grow.	Eye metsi o.
It’s very clever, you know.	Edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ, ènya.
But not, you know, not very often.	Gake menye, ènya, menye zi geɖe ŋutɔ o.
They have money.	Ga le wo si.
Life changed after that.	Agbe trɔ le ema megbe.
The police are here.	Kpovitɔwo le afisia.
No one knows his real name.	Ame aɖeke menya eƒe ŋkɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Not much in the last year.	Menye nu geɖe le ƒe mamlɛtɔ me o.
I got out of it.	Medo go le eme.
Some do, and some don’t.	Ame aɖewo wɔa esia, eye ame aɖewo ya mewɔa esia o.
He was focused on it.	Eƒe susu nɔ eŋu.
Also, the air is really bad.	Azɔ hã, ya la gblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I just had to do it.	Ðeko wòle be mawɔe.
It’s just you and me now.	Mía kple wò koe nye ema fifia.
It is more than that.	Enye nusi wu nenema.
People are angry.	Amewo doa dziku.
I want you to tell me everything.	Medi be nàgblɔ nya sia nya nam.
You really shouldn’t do that.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele be nàwɔ nu ma o.
Everything has a time and a place.	Ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe le nusianu si.
I don’t want to see this.	Nyemedi be makpɔ esia o.
But there is rarely anything in between.	Gake ƒã hafi naneke nɔa wo dome.
Potential short spaces are up in the air.	Teƒe siwo ate ŋu anɔ kpuie le ya me.
No one person can save everyone.	Ame ɖeka aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ na amesiame o.
One.	Ɖeka.
After school, it would be different.	Le suku megbe la, anye nusi to vovo.
I have to get out of here.	Ele be mado le afisia.
I do this too.	Nye hã mewɔa esia.
This section is long.	Akpa sia didi.
He was totally focused on his job.	Eƒe susu katã nɔ eƒe dɔa ŋu.
But what if the air is hot?	Gake ne ya la xɔ dzo ɖe?
His hard work just paid off.	Ðeko eƒe dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ ɖe vi.
He was just in good shape.	Ðeko wònɔ nɔnɔme nyui me.
I know you.	Menya wò.
There is nothing new in that.	Nu yeye aɖeke mele ema me o.
I can’t remember exactly.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi tututu o.
Let’s do this.	Mina míawɔ esia.
There is absolutely no chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke meli kura o.
But, for now.	Gake, fifia ya.
Up until this point, everything pretty much went its way.	Vaseɖe afisia la, nusianu yi edzi le eƒe mɔ nu kloe.
I told you what happened.	Megblɔ nu si dzɔ la na wò.
You are a good person.	Ènye ame nyui aɖe.
The men who receive them certainly thought so.	Ŋutsu siwo xɔa wo la susui nenema godoo.
This is a mistake.	Esia nye vodada.
Or something similar.	Alo nane si sɔ kple esia.
Time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi va yi.
What should that do.	Nukae wòle be ema nawɔ.
We didn’t have any time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ mía si o.
There is no one in sight.	Ame aɖeke mele ŋku dzi o.
Tom returned an hour later.	Tom trɔ gbɔ le gaƒoƒo ɖeka megbe.
I never want to be anywhere near you.	Nyemedi gbeɖe be manɔ afi aɖeke si te ɖe ŋuwò o.
It’s a really good machine.	Enye mɔ̃ nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I touched them.	Meka asi wo ŋu.
No one will do anything different for us.	Ame aɖeke mawɔ nusi to vovo na mí o.
It’s your opportunity.	Enye wò mɔnukpɔkpɔ.
It’s a crazy idea, though.	Enye susu si me susu mele o, gake.
Seems like a good idea.	Edze abe susu nyui aɖee wònye ene.
You’re the only one here.	Wò ɖeka koe le afisia.
I can barely leave my house.	Ƒã hafi mate ŋu ado le nye aƒeme.
This is just weird.	Esia nye nusi wɔ nuku ko.
Find someone to help you.	Di ame aɖe si akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
And look at me.	Eye kpɔm ɖa.
I want you.	Medi wò.
Maybe it escaped his mind.	Ðewohĩ esi le eƒe susu me.
He hasn’t looked at me yet.	Mekpɔ ŋku ɖe ŋunye haɖe o.
I had an incredible life.	Agbe si mewɔ nuku o la nɔ asinye.
I did the same with hers.	Mewɔ nenema ke ɖe eya tɔ hã ŋu.
He didn’t seem surprised.	Edze abe mewɔ nuku nɛ o ene.
The car is new.	Ʋua nye yeye.
That really surprised me.	Ema wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I can’t imagine what such a loss would be like.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi nusi bu alea anɔ la le susu me o.
Everyone has a car.	Ʋu le amesiame si.
And the most important one.	Eye esi le vevie wu.
They’re on it.	Wole edzi.
You are fine just the way you are.	Èle nyuie abe ale si tututu nèle ene.
Now it could be anyone.	Fifia ate ŋu anye amesiame.
I don’t know how to achieve that.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ aɖo ema gbɔ o.
It actually happened.	Edzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Add water as needed throughout this time.	Tsɔ tsi de eme ne ehiã le ɣeyiɣi sia katã me.
There is very little about that.	Nu sue aɖe koe le ema ŋu.
If you think it’s weird.	Ne èsusu be ewɔ nuku na ye.
His face was dirty.	Eƒe mo ƒo ɖi.
There is this issue with this issue.	Nya sia le nya sia ŋu.
Yet everything went well.	Ke hã nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
Everyone who has ever lived is dead.	Ame sia ame si nɔ agbe kpɔ la ku.
I already had my time.	Nye ɣeyiɣi nɔ asinye xoxo.
I had to be like everyone else.	Ele be manɔ abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
But it really doesn’t matter.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mehiã o.
He had to do something.	Ele be wòawɔ nane.
Well done!	Ewɔ nyuie!
But he did, too.	Gake eya hã wɔe nenema.
There had never been any water.	Tsi aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
Not that long ago.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi nenema gbegbe o.
But he couldn’t say that.	Gake mete ŋu gblɔ nya ma o.
He is not enjoying himself.	Mele dzidzɔ kpɔm o.
You can’t do this every two weeks.	Màte ŋu awɔ esia kwasiɖa eve ɖesiaɖe o.
It might be a good thing.	Ðewohĩ anye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
The case here is similar.	Nya si le afisia hã sɔ kple esia.
Much more than that.	Nu geɖe wu ema.
But hardly anyone lives that way today.	Gake ame aɖeke kura mele agbe nenema egbea o.
It seems so obvious now.	Edze abe edze ƒã ale gbegbe fifia ene.
But I do want to say this.	Gake medi be magblɔ nya sia ya.
That seems to have disappeared now.	Edze abe ema nu yi fifia ene.
He couldn’t understand it.	Mete ŋu se egɔme o.
I could look for a new job.	Mate ŋu adi dɔ yeye aɖe.
Now, it was when he was ready.	Fifia, enye esime wònɔ klalo.
Right now, however, he is obsessed with one life above all.	Gake fifia ya la, agbe ɖeka si ƒo wo katã ta la xɔ susu me nɛ.
This is a big deal.	Esia nye nya gã aɖe.
This felt like that.	Esia se le eɖokui me nenema.
It is working for us.	Ele dɔ wɔm na mí.
Things are not right for us at all.	Nuwo medze na mí kura o.
Maybe it will do a good job.	Ðewohĩ awɔ dɔ nyui aɖe.
What are we going to do about this?	Nukae míawɔ tso esia ŋu?
That’s bad for a lot of reasons.	Ema gblẽ le susu geɖe ta.
Mary was not at all surprised.	Mewɔ nuku na Maria kura o.
There is only one problem.	Kuxi ɖeka koe li.
This is not a good idea.	Esia menye susu nyui aɖeke o.
Some rules are too strict.	Se aɖewo sesẽ akpa.
Always look for the most demanding problem.	Di kuxi si bia nu geɖe wu la ɣesiaɣi.
The car was speeding.	Ʋua nɔ du dzi sesĩe.
None of us knew each other.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke menya mía nɔewo o.
That will help you.	Ema akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
That’s a very good thing.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ.
It’s a pretty clear thing.	Enye nusi me kɔ nyuie.
He didn’t tell me much at all.	Megblɔ nya geɖe nam kura o.
I can’t really get enough.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Everyone sees an issue, but no one can take very many steps.	Amesiame kpɔa nya aɖe, gake ame aɖeke mate ŋu aɖe afɔ geɖe ŋutɔ o.
This certainly wasn’t easy.	Esia menɔ bɔbɔe o godoo.
He said a lot but did little.	Nya geɖe gblɔ gake mewɔ nu boo aɖeke o.
You can always get better.	Àte ŋu ava nɔ nyuie ɣesiaɣi.
I looked his way.	Mekpɔ eƒe mɔ dzi.
That’s what it is.	Emae nye nusi wònye.
It is a lot of things.	Enye nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
There’s something extra about it.	Nane si kpe ɖe eŋu le eŋu.
And in more ways than one.	Eye le mɔ siwo wu ɖeka nu.
That obviously doesn’t make sense.	Edze ƒã be susu mele nya ma me o.
Yet.	Haɖe o.
His voice too, maybe.	Eƒe gbe hã, ɖewohĩ.
I am against you.	Metsi tre ɖe ŋuwò.
Which is what.	Nusi nye nu.
I’ve had your back through everything.	Mekpɔ wò megbe to nusianu me.
I know they have nothing on me.	Menya be naneke mele wo ŋu le dzinye o.
Everything you have in the house.	Nu sia nu si le asiwò le aƒea me.
Two men and a dog.	Ŋutsu eve kple avu ɖeka.
He might be really good.	Ðewohĩ anye ame nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This will never end.	Esia nu mayi gbeɖe o.
I couldn’t control it.	Nyemete ŋu ɖu edzi o.
There really isn’t much we can do.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ meli míate ŋu awɔ o.
Everything will be fine.	Nusianu anyo.
This has happened before.	Esia dzɔ do ŋgɔ.
There was no one there there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima le afima o.
Nothing matters now.	Naneke mele vevie fifia o.
Keep yourself busy.	Na vovo manɔ ŋuwò o.
Hold your hair back with one hand.	Tsɔ asi ɖeka lé wò ɖa ɖe megbe.
I have a clear mind.	Susu si me kɔ la le asinye.
Another better way.	Mɔ bubu si nyo wu.
He didn’t have any time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ esi o.
But no one knew how to do anything about it.	Gake ame aɖeke menya alesi woawɔ naneke tso eŋu o.
He started sweating.	Edze fifia gɔme.
That’s enough for me.	Ema sɔ gbɔ nam.
And that’s the easy part.	Eye emae nye akpa si le bɔbɔe.
You know what that would be like.	Ènya alesi ema anɔ.
This is something new to me.	Esia nye nu yeye nam.
Like more than any of these things.	Abe nusi wu nu siawo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ene.
Everyone is talking about it.	Amesiame le nu ƒom tso eŋu.
He has something.	Nane le esi.
A very good day though.	Ŋkeke nyui aɖe ŋutɔ ke hã.
In his throat.	Le eƒe kɔ me.
To be there for me.	Be manɔ afima nam.
I have things now.	Nuwo le asinye fifia.
Your anger is justified.	Wò dziku sɔ.
Everything is wet or wet.	Nusianu tsi alo xɔ dzo.
No one told me that like you did.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nam nenema abe wò ene o.
This should not be done.	Mele be woawɔ esia o.
You know his voice.	Ènya eƒe gbe.
I had a word with him.	Megblɔ nya aɖe kplii kpɔ.

They are working four days a week.	Wole dɔ wɔm ŋkeke ene le kwasiɖa me.
We have it, and we are here.	Ele mía si, eye míele afisia.
I can watch them again at will.	Mate ŋu akpɔ wo ake le nye didi nu.
Too many problems.	Kuxi geɖe akpa.
Maybe, something is wrong with me.	Ðewohĩ, nane gblẽ le ŋunye.
Which is just good for me.	Nusi nyo ko nam.
Everyone liked him.	Amesiame ƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
It’s a normal thing.	Enye nusi sɔ.
It had been a difficult time for us there.	Enye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe na mí le afima tsã.
No news will come out of that.	Nya aɖeke mado tso ema me o.
I’m not quite sure what’s going on in my head.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi le edzi yim le ta me dzi tututu o.
He was happy to go.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ be yeayi.
Eve didn’t do that.	Eve mewɔe nenema o.
There used to be a child alive.	Tsã la, ɖevi aɖe nɔa agbe.
You can just walk up and down really easily.	Àte ŋu azɔ ayi dzi kple edzi bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ ko.
The wind, turn.	Ya la, trɔ.

These past few weeks have been hard for me.	Kwasiɖa ʋɛ siawo siwo va yi la sesẽ nam ŋutɔ.
But he had nothing to do.	Gake naneke menɔ esi wòawɔ o.
Another life was ruined.	Agbe bubu aɖe hã gblẽ.
The truth will usually lie somewhere in between.	Zi geɖe la, nyateƒea anɔ afi aɖe le wo dome.
This really shouldn’t be surprising.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele be esia nawɔ nuku o.
I think you’re right there.	Mesusu be èle afima tututu.
But tell me this.	Gake gblɔ nya sia nam.
He worked hard, but he never made much money.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe, gake mekpɔ ga geɖe kpɔ o.
We don’t expect much from them.	Míele mɔ kpɔm na nu geɖe tso wo me o.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
You will be surprised.	Awɔ nuku na wò ŋutɔ.
You can expect more hair to accompany it.	Àte ŋu akpɔ mɔ be ɖa geɖe akpe ɖe eŋu.
I really don’t want to know.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be manya o.
He had the gun in his hand.	Tu la nɔ esi.
He will have a good heart.	Dzi nyui anɔ esi.
He would struggle with an unfamiliar voice.	Awɔ avu kple gbe aɖe si menya nyuie o.
I don’t really know what will happen to him.	Nyemenya nusi adzɔ ɖe edzi tututu o.
He would have been obviously out of place there.	Anye ne edze ƒã be megale teƒe aɖeke le afima o.
This hit home.	Esia ƒo ɖe aƒeme.
Food is a serious problem.	Nuɖuɖu nye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.

This can’t be my reality.	Esia mate ŋu anye nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
No one really knows what happened.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi dzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
No one was eating.	Ame aɖeke menɔ nu ɖum o.
Keep a positive attitude.	Na susu nyui nanɔ asiwò.
I can’t remember his name now .	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi fifia o .
There was nothing personal about any of them.	Ame ŋutɔ ƒe naneke menɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke me o.
Things just can’t go on like this.	Ðeko nuwo mate ŋu ayi edzi alea o.
He will bear it.	Ado dzi.
Not with a gun to his head.	Menye kple tu ɖe eƒe ta ŋu o.
You're still busy.	Tu la bu.
I have omitted two of these words.	Meɖe nya siawo dometɔ eve ɖa.
I don’t know what’s missing.	Nyemenya nusi bu o.
I like your attitude.	Wò nɔnɔme dze ŋunye.
There was little time to do anything.	Ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe nɔ anyi be woawɔ nane.
We don’t know what’s going to happen.	Míenya nusi ava dzɔ o.
And it’s so simple.	Eye wòle bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
It’s a difficult issue.	Enye nya sesẽ aɖe.
I can’t do that to them.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma ɖe wo ŋu o.
But they have a simple one.	Gake ɖeka bɔbɔe aɖe le wo si.
It’s a huge part of me.	Enye nye akpa gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
This has been doing my head for the last few hours.	Esia le nye ta wɔm le gaƒoƒo ʋɛ siwo va yi me.

I decided to do it tonight.	Meɖoe be mawɔe le zã sia me.
Again, how are you.	Le afisia hã la, aleke nèle.
Call me if there is any question.	Ƒo ka nam ne nya aɖe li.
I was a little hot and needed some fresh air.	Mexɔ dzo vie eye mehiã ya nyui aɖe.
I heard his voice.	Mese eƒe gbe.
I'm the one who is.	Nyee nye nye.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.

Listen to the way you’re talking.	Se ale si nèle nu ƒom la ɖa.

But there used to be someone back there.	Gake ame aɖe nɔ megbe le afima tsã.

As it stands, it is highly unlikely.	Abe alesi wòle ene la, manya wɔ kura o.
But he could have more.	Gake nu geɖe wu ate ŋu anɔ esi.
You’re attracted to him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi na wò.
Or donate here.	Alo dzɔ nu le afisia.
I think there are two things here.	Mesusu be nu eve aɖewo le afisia.
This is very short.	Esia le kpuie ŋutɔ.
This project seems to have been well received.	Edze abe amewo xɔ dɔ sia nyuie ene.
But we know what we know.	Gake míenya nu si míenya.
He was fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
Take a closer look.	Lé ŋku ɖe nu ŋu nyuie.
Please let me know if this is okay with you.	Taflatse na manya ne esia nyo na wò.

There is no form of life.	Agbe ƒomevi aɖeke meli o.

He had a better idea.	Susu si nyo wu va nɔ esi.
I always need help.	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu ɣesiaɣi.
There was plenty of room for everything.	Teƒe geɖe nɔ anyi na nusianu.
He will see this clearly.	Akpɔ esia nyuie.
And his life, too.	Eye eƒe agbe hã.

They have to do what they have to do.	Ele be woawɔ nu si wòle be woawɔ.
But he still couldn’t do it.	Gake mete ŋu wɔe kokoko o.
No one can know about it.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu anya nu tso eŋu o.
My life is over.	Nye agbe wu enu.
I'll call him.	Maƒo ka nɛ.
It's right here.	Ele afisia tututu.
Nothing good can come of it.	Nu nyui aɖeke mate ŋu ado tso eme o.
He isn’t doing anything.	Mele naneke wɔm o.
He seemed unsure of himself.	Edze abe meka ɖe eɖokui dzi o ene.
That is simply not true.	Ðeko nya ma menye nyateƒe o.
Yet much remains the same.	Ke hã nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ le nenema.
And other little things like that.	Eye nu sue bubu siwo le abe ema ene.
There’s nothing like that about that.	Naneke meli si sɔ kple ema le ema ŋu o.
This is too much for me.	Esia sɔ gbɔ nam akpa.
No one ever heard a word.	Ame aɖeke mese nya aɖeke kpɔ o.
But the issue remains money.	Gake nya la gakpɔtɔ nye ga.
He looked like he was talking to someone.	Edze abe ɖe wòle nu ƒom na ame aɖe ene.
This book happened simultaneously.	Agbalẽ sia dzɔ le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
It was like someone else was there.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe ame bubu aɖe nɔ afima ene.
This is not working.	Esia mele dɔ wɔm o.
I think everything is fascinating.	Mesusu be nusianu doa dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
Everyone must follow these rules.	Ele be ame sia ame nawɔ ɖe se siawo dzi.

He didn’t know what he did.	Menya nusi wòwɔ o.

But I wanted to do more.	Gake medi be mawɔ geɖe wu.

In addition to them.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe wo ŋu.

That goes for everyone else too.	Ema yi na ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã.
It’s not a big building.	Menye xɔ gã aɖee wònye o.

That way isn’t working.	Mɔ ma mele dɔ wɔm o.

But he made a mistake.	Gake ewɔ vodada.
Expect your surprise.	Kpɔ mɔ na wò nusi awɔ nuku na wò.
I've seen something like this before.	Mekpɔ nane si le abe esia ene kpɔ.
I wonder what this outfit will end up being.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae awu sia ava nye mlɔeba hã.
It would take too much time.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe akpa.
He was a good horse.	Enye sɔ nyui aɖe.
How loud everything sounded.	Aleke gbegbe nusianu ɖi sesĩe enye si.
His character is that of a king.	Eƒe nɔnɔme nye fia ƒe nɔnɔme.
Some come from a difficult background.	Ame aɖewo tso nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe me.
Existing laws must be followed.	Ele be woawɔ ɖe se siwo li fifia dzi.
That was just a few weeks ago.	Kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo koe nye ema va yi.
Decide what is important.	Tso nya me le nusi le vevie ŋu.

The result can be fatal.	Nusi ado tso eme ate ŋu awu ame.
But he wasn’t the only one.	Gake menye eya ɖeka koe o.

But people are not like that.	Gake amewo ya mele nenema o.

That surprised me a lot.	Ema wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
Things can’t go on like that.	Nuwo mate ŋu ayi edzi nenema o.

No one said it was.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ be ele nenema o.
No one saw the first fire fall.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ dzo gbãtɔ si dze anyi o.
It really doesn’t matter.	Le nyateƒe me la, mehiã o.
He didn’t marry anyone else.	Meɖe ame bubu aɖeke o.
We need to make a plan here.	Ele be míawɔ ɖoɖo aɖe le afisia.
They had little else.	Nu sue aɖe koe nɔ wo si kpe ɖe eŋu.
Some people said it could help me.	Ame aɖewo gblɔ be ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
I needed to talk to him.	Ehiã be maƒo nu kplii.
That looks pretty good.	Ema dze nyuie ŋutɔ.

But the roles matter.	Gake akpa siwo wɔa akpa aɖe le vevie.
This place is amazing.	Teƒe sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.

It doesn’t matter.	Mehiã o.
Do it your way.	Wɔe le wò mɔ nu.
He wasn’t so sure.	Meka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o.

Water streamed down his face.	Tsi ƒo ɖe eƒe mo.
But listen to this.	Gake ɖo to nya sia.
As long as it doesn’t cost us much.	Zi alesi mexɔ asi boo aɖeke na mí o ko.
Which is probably good.	Nusi anya nyo.
And I’m going to be fired.	Eye wole nye hã ɖe ge le dɔ me.
People believe in what they want.	Amewo xɔ nusi dim wole la dzi se.

This is very important.	Esia le vevie ŋutɔ.
Just calling to check on you.	Ðeko wòle ka ƒom be makpɔ wò nɔnɔme.
I’ve never seen them before.	Nyemekpɔ wo kpɔ o.

He wasn't sure his voice was steady enough to answer.	Meka ɖe edzi be yeƒe gbe li ke ale gbegbe be yeate ŋu aɖo eŋu o.
It has never been like this.	Menɔ alea kpɔ o.
You have no valid word.	Nya aɖeke mele asiwò si sɔ o.
This is a bit surprising.	Esia wɔ nuku vie.
Run your tongue through your mouth.	Du wò aɖe to wò nu me.
He didn't seem to be doing much of anything.	Edze abe ɖe menɔ naneke wɔm boo o ene.
It didn’t get any easier.	Meva nɔ bɔbɔe wu ema o.
Maybe now, of course.	Ðewohĩ fifia ya.
However, there are some people who are not eligible to work at any age.	Gake ame aɖewo li siwo medze awɔ dɔ le ƒe ɖesiaɖe me o.
Let this guy deal with you.	Na ŋutsu sia nawɔ nu kpli wò.
Do it quickly, too.	Wɔe kaba, hã.
We had one first thing.	Nu gbãtɔ ɖeka nɔ mía si.
I really didn’t have time though.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye o gake.

But he didn’t want me to.	Gake medi be mawɔe o.

He never did that.	Mewɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
He put his ear to his mouth.	Etsɔ eƒe to ɖo eƒe nu gbɔ.
Glad to hear that.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mese nya ma.
Everything, but everything, was too much for him.	Nusianu, gake nusianu, sɔ gbɔ nɛ akpa.
There had been a teacher there.	Nufiala aɖe nɔ afima kpɔ.
I have to stay focused.	Ele be nye susu nanɔ nu ŋu.
But after that first month, it’s easy.	Gake le ɣleti gbãtɔ ma megbe la, ele bɔbɔe.
You can actually do it.	Àte ŋu awɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And for a good reason.	Eye nu nyui aɖe tae.
People who are looking for help have approached us.	Ame siwo le kpekpeɖeŋu dim la te ɖe mía ŋu.
It will be fine now.	Anye nyuie fifia.
Maybe it started with the previous one.	Ðewohĩ edze egɔme tso esi do ŋgɔ dzi.
It’s clearly the case.	Eme kɔ ƒã.
I know about many of them.	Menya nu tso wo dometɔ geɖe ŋu.
One new project.	Dɔ yeye ɖeka.

I hope he's still not that angry.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be megale dziku dom nenema kokoko o.
See the appropriate sections on these problems.	Kpɔ akpa siwo sɔ ku ɖe kuxi siawo ŋu.
Two weeks, no rules.	Kwasiɖa eve, se aɖeke meli o.
He would have taken that upon himself.	Etsɔ ema de eɖokui dzi hafi.
He might do anything.	Ðewohĩ awɔ nusianu.
These people don’t do that.	Ame siawo mewɔa esia o.
I'm not sure it would help anyway.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be akpe ɖe eŋu le mɔ sia mɔ nu o.
It will come tomorrow.	Etsɔ ava.
Believe me,	Xɔ dzinye se, .
There was a reason why.	Susu aɖe nɔ anyi si tae.
I like the way my life really is.	Ale si tututu nye agbe le la dzɔa dzi nam.
This man knows nothing.	Ŋutsu sia menya naneke o.
Actually, quite a few of them.	Le nyateƒe me la, wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe.
Maybe he’ll let me stay in his room.	Ðewohĩ ana manɔ eƒe xɔ me.
I was in the car.	Menɔ ʋua me.
Yet it didn’t matter before.	Ke hã menɔ vevie tsã o.
What day is it? 	Ŋkeke kae wònye?
There were at least four of them.	Wo dometɔ ene ya teti nɔ anyi.
It’s only here this week.	Kwasiɖa sia me koe wòle afisia.
You shouldn’t do that.	Mele be nàwɔ nu ma o.
We were very excited.	Dzi dzɔ mí ŋutɔ.
But that’s what you like about it.	Gake emae nye nusi dzɔa dzi na wò le eŋu.
That’s why.	Esia tae.
There were just no rules.	Ðeko se aɖeke menɔ anyi o.

Glad I met him though!	Edzɔ dzi nam be medo go ya!
More often than not, I refused.	Zi geɖe wu la, megbe.
But that doesn’t matter at all.	Gake ema mehiã kura o.
It’s a deserted road.	Enye mɔ si dzi ame aɖeke mele o.
Someone is asking about me.	Ame aɖe le nya biam tso ŋunye.
It looks pretty amazing.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ ene.
There was no offensive voice.	Gbe aɖeke menɔ anyi si doa dziku o.
At least a little way.	Mɔ sue aɖe ya teti.
Now he is interested.	Fifia etsɔ ɖe le eme.
Please stay a moment.	Taflatse nɔ anyi vie.
In fact, they seemed to like it.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze abe edzɔ dzi na wo ene.
He had only one leg, and one hand.	Afɔ ɖeka koe nɔ esi, eye asi ɖeka hã nɔ esi.
A person of dignity.	Ame si ŋu bubu le.
I don't know what will happen to him.	Nyemenya nusi ava dzɔ ɖe edzi o.
But, the current mistake is an exception.	Gake, vodada si le edzi yim fifia la nye nusi to vovo.
But there is no one else.	Gake ame bubu aɖeke meli o.
But it deserves more than that.	Gake edze nam wu ema.
He had lost many of his teeth.	Eƒe aɖu geɖe bu.
He wouldn’t let go.	Maɖe asi le eŋu o.
I took them off my face.	Meɖe wo le nye mo.
It’s not good enough.	Menye nyuie o.
Why no one else did it was beyond him.	Nusita ame bubu aɖeke mewɔe o la wu eya ŋutɔ.
Maybe it’s something else.	Ðewohĩ nu bubu aɖee.
Everything happened in a blur.	Nusianu dzɔ le mɔ si me kɔ o me.
I knew he would do that.	Menya be awɔe nenema.
Save everyone.	Ðe ame sia ame ŋu.
He did it accordingly.	Ewɔ ɖe edzi.

Something needs to be done about it.	Ele be woawɔ nane tso eŋu.
He just didn’t understand.	Ðeko mese egɔme o.
I felt so strongly.	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ale gbegbe.
And he did an incredible job.	Eye ewɔ dɔ si mexɔ se o.
It was the first time.	Enye zi gbãtɔ.
Something big happened this morning.	Nu gã aɖe dzɔ le ŋdi sia me.
No kind of food seems to be able to come here.	Edze abe nuɖuɖu ƒomevi aɖeke mate ŋu ava afisia o ene.
It was great to work with him.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
Maybe he’s sick.	Ðewohĩ edze dɔ.
I can't remember what else either.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nu bubu si hã dzi o.

I was doing this.	Menɔ esia wɔm.
Something new had to be done.	Ele be woawɔ nu yeye aɖe.
But there is nothing.	Gake naneke meli o.
From now on, he will take care of it himself.	Tso fifia dzi la, eya ŋutɔ akpɔ edzi.
There’s nothing like a little fresh air.	Naneke meli si le abe ya nyui vi aɖe ene o.
Almost the same.	Nenema ke kloe.
That’s quite a challenge.	Ema nye kuxi ŋutɔ.
He has worked hard over the past few days.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe le ŋkeke ʋɛ siwo va yi me.
We still had work to do.	Dɔ aɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ mía si míawɔ.
I don’t want to go.	Nyemedi be mayi o.
He can’t leave the house.	Mate ŋu ado le aƒea me o.
A really good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But he had no new ones.	Gake yeye aɖeke menɔ esi o.
Take care of everything.	Kpɔ nusianu dzi.
These mountains are beautiful.	To siawo nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.

He patted the dog on the head.	Etsɔ asi ƒo avu la ƒe ta.
And it has worked.	Eye ewɔ dɔ kpɔ.
We know what it’s like.	Míenya alesi wòle.
Also, look at the head.	Azɔ hã, kpɔ ta.
Tonight was a surprise for him.	Zã sia nye nusi wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.

There is absolutely no problem with this.	Kuxi aɖeke kura mele esia ŋu o.

Only one thing is missing.	Nu ɖeka koe bu.
There is a market nearby.	Asi aɖe te ɖe afima ŋu.
There will be.	Anɔ anyi.
Now look at me.	Azɔ kpɔm ɖa.
I can’t tell you to do this.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ na wò be nàwɔ esia o.
I really don’t like this guy.	Ŋutsu sia medze ŋunye ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He never touched us.	Meka asi mía ŋu kpɔ o.
It’s amazing today.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ egbea.
Every month is different.	Ɣleti ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
That’s just his way.	Eƒe mɔ koe nye ema.
There is a hand or there is not.	Asi li alo meli o.

That was very hot.	Ema xɔ dzo ŋutɔ.
There has to be a mistake.	Ele be vodada aɖe nanɔ anyi.
There was the lake, and there was the market.	Ta la nɔ afima, eye asi hã nɔ afima.

He still wasn’t sure about that.	Meka ɖe nya ma dzi kokoko o.

There is so much possibility in this place.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li si ate ŋu adzɔ le teƒe sia.

His face was hard.	Eƒe mo sesẽ.

I just couldn’t relax.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ɖe dzi ɖi o.
It wouldn’t surprise me at all.	Mawɔ nuku nam kura o.

But there is still much to be done in this regard.	Gake nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ le go sia me.
He wasn't ready for that yet.	Menɔ klalo na ema haɖe o.

It’s just not here.	Ðeko mele afisia o.

Park your car properly.	Tsɔ wò ʋua tɔ nyuie.

You have to make a new one.	Ele be nàwɔ yeye aɖe.
Divide it into four parts.	Ma eme ɖe ene me.

You can’t do anything wrong.	Màte ŋu awɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.

I was very nervous about the whole thing.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ ɖe nu bliboa ŋu.
In a way he never expected.	Le mɔ aɖe si mekpɔ mɔ na kpɔ o nu.
I never wanted you.	Nyemedi wò kpɔ o.

Everything came to an end.	Nusianu va wu enu.
I hope he does that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔe nenema.
I think that part is also somewhat true.	Mesusu be akpa ma hã nye nyateƒe vie.
We will do this as soon as the meeting begins.	Míawɔ esia ne kpekpea dze egɔme ko.
That means he is not here.	Ema fia be mele afisia o.
You can’t be there now.	Màte ŋu anɔ afi ma fifia o.

It didn’t, it hadn’t for too long.	Mewɔe o, mewɔe nenema ɣeyiɣi didi akpa o.
At that point, night fell.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, zã do.
You're here.	Èle afisia.
There is no need for more.	Mehiã be woawɔ nu geɖe wu o.
Like that last one.	Abe mamlɛtɔ ma ene.
Two people died.	Ame eve ku.
Stretch a long string between two spaces.	Ke ka didi aɖe ɖe teƒe eve dome.
And that’s no small thing.	Eye ema menye nu sue aɖeke o.
I can be anyone.	Mate ŋu anye amesiame.
This is no small feat.	Esia menye nu sue aɖeke o.
And that’s hard enough.	Eye ema sesẽ ale gbegbe.
But another problem arose.	Gake kuxi bubu aɖe do mo ɖa.
He never introduced anyone.	Meɖe ame aɖeke fia gbeɖe o.
He never answered.	Meɖo eŋu kpɔ o.
It can be very helpful for current employees.	Ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame siwo le dɔ wɔm fifia ŋu ŋutɔ.
Someone is speaking.	Ame aɖe le nu ƒom.
Something else happened instead.	Nu bubu aɖe hã dzɔ ɖe eteƒe.
A few of us.	Mía dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo.
Go through the issue.	To nya la ŋu.
It’s a part of me.	Enye nye akpa aɖe.
Actually, a great mental thing.	Le nyateƒe me la, susu me nu gã aɖe.
Can't you see this.	Ðe màte ŋu akpɔ esia oa.
There is nothing to be done about it.	Naneke meli woawɔ tso eŋu o.
This shouldn’t be surprising at all.	Mele be esia nawɔ nuku kura o.
I am working on it for me.	Mele dɔ wɔm le eŋu nam.
You can’t do it before or after that.	Màte ŋu awɔe do ŋgɔ na ema alo le ema megbe o.
We’re doing everything right here.	Míele nusianu wɔm nyuie le afisia.
There are some reasons why.	Susu aɖewo li siwo tae.
We hope you are too!.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be wò hã èle nenema!.
This is a new phenomenon.	Esia nye nu yeye aɖe.
I couldn’t do this.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ esia o.
I am sure that can happen.	Meka ɖe edzi be ate ŋu adzɔ nenema.
Pause for a moment.	Dzudzɔ vie.
Will continue to work on this.	Ayi edzi anɔ dɔ wɔm tso esia ŋu.
Anger shot through him.	Dziku ƒo to eme.
But come out.	Gake va do.
I don’t know much about them.	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso wo ŋu o.
I have encountered that before.	Medo go nya ma do ŋgɔ.
He couldn’t do enough for her.	Mete ŋu wɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ nɛ o.
An hour has passed.	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka va yi.
Not on this basis.	Menye le esia dzi o.
This book as a whole is excellent.	Agbalẽ sia katã nyo ŋutɔ.
Hours passed by.	Gaƒoƒo geɖe va yi.
This is more than that.	Esia de ŋgɔ wu ema.
No one knew who was behind it.	Ame aɖeke menya amesi nɔ megbe nɛ o.
Who had it.	Amekae nɔ esi.
Now at least he has some help.	Fifia ya teti la, kpekpeɖeŋu aɖe le esi.
But no one could tell me what it was.	Gake ame aɖeke mete ŋu gblɔ nusi wònye nam o.
There is almost nothing we can do.	Naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ o kloe.
We should have insisted.	Ðe wòle be míate tɔ ɖe edzi hafi.
But I wanted to do more.	Gake medi be mawɔ geɖe wu.
None of them said anything.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
This is also a good one.	Esia hã nye nyui aɖe.
Here, let me share.	Le afisia la, na ma.
Everyone turned to that person.	Amesiame trɔ ɖe ame ma ŋu.
An excellent result.	Nusi do tso eme nyuie ŋutɔ.
That’s over now.	Ema wu enu fifia.
But it is something.	Gake enye nane.
I can’t hear them.	Nyemate ŋu ase wo o.
It was four o'clock in the morning.	Ŋdi ga ene ye nye ema.
No one came along.	Ame aɖeke meva o.
Treat it like a precious stone.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu abe kpe nyui si wònye ene.
He never said a word.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke kpɔ o.
Everyone’s head.	Amesiame ƒe ta.
Looks like you are, thank you.	Edze abe alesi nèle ene, akpe na wò.
Imagine being in that car.	Bu eŋu kpɔ be èle ʋu ma me.
The simple thing.	Nusi le bɔbɔe.
Any clarity would be very helpful.	Nya ɖesiaɖe si me kɔ la akpe ɖe ame ŋu ŋutɔ.
Your feet, your mouth.	Wò afɔ, wò nu.
It’s a great time in life.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe le agbe me.
Life is not against you.	Agbe metsi tre ɖe ŋuwò o.
Everything is fine, really.	Nusianu le nyuie, le nyateƒe me.
He must have had a tough week.	Kwasiɖa sesẽ aɖe anya nɔ esi.
Who is he, anyway? 	Amekae wònye?
Anger covered his face.	Dziku xɔ eƒe mo.
We can do that here too.	Míate ŋu awɔ ema le afisia hã.
Some recipients donate money.	Ame aɖewo siwo xɔa ga la dzɔa ga.
Take a closer look at the object.	Lé ŋku ɖe nu la ŋu nyuie.
Everyone expects you	Amesiame kpɔa mɔ na wò
Where are you.	Afi kae nèle.
He had a knack for that sort of thing.	Aɖaŋu aɖe nɔ esi le nu ma ƒomevi wɔwɔ me.
My heart stopped.	Nye dzi tɔ te.
The sweat ran down his throat.	Fifia la ƒu du to eƒe kɔ me.
I don’t want to know my age.	Nyemedi be manya ƒe si mexɔ o.
There will be some songs.	Ha aɖewo anɔ eme.
It is absolutely true.	Enye nyateƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That may not actually be the case.	Ðewohĩ le nyateƒe me la, ema manɔ anyi o.
And it would be nice if there were some books on that subject.	Eye anyo ŋutɔ ne agbalẽ aɖewo li siwo ƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu.
After that, we don’t know what happened to him.	Le ema megbe la, míenya nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi o.
Please let me know when it happens.	Taflatse na manya ne edzɔ.
I don’t have to do it.	Mehiã be mawɔe o.
That’s not a bad thing at all.	Ema menye nu gbegblẽ kura o.
You can do that here.	Àte ŋu awɔ ema le afisia.
He's not running anywhere.	Mele du dzi le afi aɖeke o.
Or at least what it could be.	Alo nusi wòate ŋu anye ya teti.
Click on it, click on it.	Zi edzi, zi edzi.
Your hair is beautiful!	Wò ɖa nya kpɔ ŋutɔ!
It's on my way.	Ele nye mɔ dzi.
Just not right now.	Ðeko menye fifia o.
Not for your teacher’s.	Menye na wò nufiala tɔ o.
No one is sure what went wrong.	Ame aɖeke meka ɖe nusi gblẽ la dzi o.
Change your attitude.	Trɔ wò nɔnɔme.
But not for me.	Gake menye nam o.
I am sure of it in my real life.	Meka ɖe edzi le nye agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ me.
We’ve been here a long time, too long.	Míele afisia ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia, ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
That must be the truth.	Ele be nyateƒea nanɔ nenema.
Through food and through the entire food chain.	To nuɖuɖu kple to nuɖuɖu ƒe ɖoɖo bliboa me.
Still, he may have had a point.	Ke hã, ɖewohĩ nya aɖe nɔ esi.
It’s probably nothing.	Anɔ eme be menye naneke o.
I couldn’t do it.	Nyemete ŋui o.
I should be able to do that.	Ele be mate ŋu awɔ ema.
There was no room for anyone.	Teƒe menɔ anyi na ame aɖeke o.
That was what he wanted.	Emae nye nusi dim wònɔ.
About two months.	Anɔ abe ɣleti eve ene.
I told myself you weren’t really important to me.	Megblɔ na ɖokuinye be mèle vevie nam ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
The people in the room checked to make sure everyone was OK.	Ame siwo nɔ xɔa me la lé ŋku ɖe eŋu be amesiame le nyuie hã.
One of them died.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka ku.
He had never seen anything like it.	Mekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
I didn’t know enough to try something like that.	Nyemenya nusi sɔ gbɔ be mate nane si le abe ema ene kpɔ o.
I didn’t have time.	Vovo menɔ ŋunye o.
We need to do something different with our child.	Ele be míawɔ nusi to vovo na mía vi.
How do you know what the dog is going to do.	Aleke nàwɔ anya nusi avu la le wɔwɔ ge.
I’m fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
For this reason, a location became necessary.	Le susu sia ta la, teƒe aɖe va hiã.
Go to work.	Yi dɔme.
I ended up in trouble.	Meva ge ɖe kuxi me mlɔeba.
I do not know.	Nye menya o.
He didn’t care about me.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam o.
There are only a few of them now.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe li fifia.
I thought the previous one was just fine.	Mesusu be esi do ŋgɔ la nyo ko.
Add salt, if needed.	Tsɔ dze de eme, ne ehiã.
This will help you a lot.	Esia akpe ɖe ŋuwò ŋutɔ.
People are probably really happy with you.	Anɔ eme be amewo le dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ ɖe ŋuwò.
I raised my hand.	Medo asi ɖe dzi.
Whether it is true is another matter.	Nenye be enye nyateƒe la, enye nya bubu.
His job is difficult.	Eƒe dɔa sesẽ.
He can only remember when he is calm.	Ne eƒe dzi dze eme ko hafi wòate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi.
This is going to be a happy day.	Esia ava nye ŋkeke si dzi dzidzɔ le.
I will talk to him.	Maƒo nu kplii.
In this book, we will do the same.	Le agbalẽ sia me la, míawɔ nenema ke.
That was the first problem.	Emae nye kuxi gbãtɔ.
He had many houses.	Aƒe geɖe nɔ esi.
I'm working late tonight.	Mele dɔ wɔm le zã sia me tsi megbe.
I quickly withdrew.	Meɖe eɖokui ɖa kaba.
Something that certainly didn’t surprise us.	Nane si mewɔ nuku na mí o godoo.
I have a lot of things.	Nu geɖe le asinye.
I know you.	Menya wo.
He ended his life with his own hand.	Etsɔ eya ŋutɔ ƒe asi wu eƒe agbe nu.
I can never do anything right.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke nyuie gbeɖe o.
It’s a real home from home.	Enye aƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ si tso aƒeme.
We’re really looking forward to it.	Míele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
As a matter of law.	Abe se ƒe nya ene la.
I can't seem to get this to work.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu ana esia nawɔ dɔ o ene.
And in my life, too.	Eye le nye agbe me hã.
You have to do everything.	Ele be nàwɔ nusianu.
But that’s the easiest part.	Gake emae nye nusi le bɔbɔe wu.
It’s not a downside.	Menye nusi gblẽ le eŋu o.
I know how to do it.	Menya alesi mawɔe.
There was no anger in his voice.	Dziku aɖeke menɔ eƒe gbe me o.
That was his plan.	Emae nye eƒe ɖoɖo.
Heat over medium heat.	Do dzo ɖe dzo si sɔ dzi.
There is no mistake.	Vodada aɖeke meli o.
It didn’t bother him at all.	Meɖe fu nɛ kura o.
I’m not going to do it.	Nyemele ewɔ ge o.
Nor did he make it for breakfast.	Eye mewɔe hã na ŋdi nuɖuɖu o.
Not that it matters very much.	Menye ɖe wòle vevie ŋutɔ o.
Someone who has filed a complaint.	Ame aɖe si tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu.
This is very effective.	Esia wɔa dɔ ŋutɔ.
But this is too advanced.	Gake esia de ŋgɔ akpa.
Right now it doesn’t.	Fifia la, mewɔa esia o.
I have stayed at his house.	Menɔ eƒe aƒeme kpɔ.
You have a real job and a nice apartment.	Dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ kple xɔ nyui aɖe le asiwò.
That is a valid statement.	Nya ma sɔ.
It can do everything together.	Ate ŋu awɔ nusianu ɖekae.
His head was shaking.	Eƒe ta ƒo.
And no one knows where he is.	Eye ame aɖeke menya afi si wòle o.
I can’t figure out how to do it.	Nyemate ŋu anya alesi mawɔe o.
I just need to stay a little longer.	Ðeko wòle be manɔ anyi vie.
Just like we are.	Abe alesi míele ene.
His voice disappeared a few times.	Eƒe gbe bu zi ʋɛ aɖewo.
The water here is so dirty.	Tsi si le afisia la ƒo ɖi ale gbegbe.
We kind of knew it was something else.	Míenya le mɔ aɖe nu be enye nu bubu aɖe.
His mouth fell off.	Eƒe nu dze anyi.
This is quite obvious for several reasons.	Esia dze ƒã ŋutɔ le susu geɖe ta.
I can take care of myself.	Mate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye dzi.
And to my surprise, it worked out pretty well.	Eye ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ be ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
He was just very tired.	Ðeko ɖeɖi te eŋu ŋutɔ.
People already know about this.	Amewo nya nu tso esia ŋu xoxo.
What you think it is.	Nusi nèsusu be enye.
We could have handled that.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ hafi.
Please throw this in here.	Taflatse, tsɔ esia ƒu gbe ɖe afisia.
We don’t know any better.	Míenya nu bubu aɖeke wu ema o.
Try everything he can.	Te nusianu si wòate ŋui kpɔ.
You will have many opportunities.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe ava wò.
This was like this not like me.	Esia nɔ alea menye abe nye ene o.
Or if, after a while, it starts to go wrong.	Alo nenye be, le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe la, edze nu gbegblẽ wɔwɔ gɔme.
It doesn’t matter now.	Mehiã fifia o.
Also there may be some minor errors.	Azɔ hã vodada sue aɖewo ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
That may be true.	Nya ma ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
But it is important that there are no issues with it at all.	Gake ele vevie be nya aɖewo nanɔ eŋu kura o.
Do something for someone.	Wɔ nu na ame aɖe.
You don’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele asiwò o.
He was a great person in it.	Enye ame gã aɖe le eme.
Look like the good guy.	Dze abe ŋutsu nyui la ene.
I know it's weird.	Menya be enye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I never knew that.	Nyemenya nya ma kpɔ o.
But no one answered.	Gake ame aɖeke meɖo eŋu o.
It is the first.	Enye gbãtɔ.
The buildings here are badly damaged.	Xɔ siwo le afisia gblẽ vevie.
Could that be true?.	Ðe ema ate ŋu anye nyateƒea?.
Too many people just waiting there.	Ame geɖe akpa le lalam le afima ko.
Tell us about that.	Gblɔ nya ma na mí.
It’s a good thing.	Enye nu nyui aɖe.
I paused, not knowing what to do.	Metsi tre vie, nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
Like a little child.	Abe ɖevi sue aɖe ene.
That’s the name of it.	Emae nye eƒe ŋkɔ.
There is no one he can tell about this.	Ame aɖeke meli wòate ŋu agblɔ tso esia ŋu o.
I liked the small case of the gun.	Nu sue si me tu la le la dze ŋunye ŋutɔ.
This may take some time, of course.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe ya.
I definitely know that place from the inside.	Menya teƒe ma tso eme godoo.
I wasn’t very confident in myself.	Nyemeka ɖe ɖokuinye dzi boo o.
But in reality.	Gake le nyateƒe me la.
It’s not you.	Menye wòe o.
Think about this problem carefully.	Bu kuxi sia ŋu nyuie.
As far as we know, there is none.	Le alesi míenya nu la, ɖeke meli o.
I was going to do it.	Menɔ ewɔ ge.
Or something like that.	Alo nane si le abe ema ene.
Always the back of my mind was working.	Ɣesiaɣi la, nye susu ƒe megbe nɔ dɔ wɔm.
So head for him.	Eya ta nɛ.
That’s what he has.	Emae nye nusi le esi.
People look at you.	Amewo doa ŋku ɖe ŋuwò.
Which shouldn’t surprise me.	Nusi mele be wòawɔ nuku nam o.
I like this house.	Aƒe sia dzɔa dzi nam.
It was an old car.	Ʋu xoxo aɖee wònye.
But this could not overcome him.	Gake esia mete ŋu ɖu edzi o.
The house was a work in progress.	Aƒea nye dɔ si nɔ edzi yim.
This could be useful for that.	Esia ate ŋu aɖe vi na ema.
It’s been amazing so far.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ vaseɖe fifia.
I didn’t start it.	Menye nyee dze egɔme o.
This means that	Esia fia be .
Or many other things.	Alo nu bubu geɖe.
There was no road right there.	Mɔ aɖeke menɔ afima tututu o.
It’s a new normal.	Enye nu yeye si sɔ.
There are some things we can do now that can help.	Nu aɖewo li míate ŋu awɔ fifia siwo ate ŋu akpe ɖe mía ŋu.
Maybe no one can help you.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖeke mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò o.
I am not able to go through this problem.	Nyemete ŋu le kuxi sia me tom o.
Otherwise, these are normal people.	Ne menye nenema o la, ame siawo nye ame siwo sɔ.
I didn’t feel that way.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema o.
He didn’t see how he could improve on it.	Mekpɔ ale si wòawɔ anyo ɖe edzi le eŋu o.
It is neither early nor late.	Menye kaba alo tsi megbe o.
It really is as simple as that.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
I don’t have it.	Mele asinye o.
And so did I.	Eye nye hã.
I couldn’t afford a new car.	Nyemete ŋu ƒle ʋu yeye o.
I am fine with that.	Mele nyuie le nya ma me.
I always had something to say to him.	Nya aɖe nɔa asinye magblɔ nɛ ɣesiaɣi.
That opened my eyes.	Ema ʋu ŋku nam.
There’s a lot at work in it.	Nu geɖe le dɔ wɔm le eme.
He was completely surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ kura.
I like the people who work there.	Ame siwo wɔa dɔ le afima la dzɔa dzi nam.
There’s nothing for me here.	Naneke meli nam le afisia o.
Actually, not in any hours.	Le nyateƒe me la, menye le gaƒoƒo aɖeke me o.
I’m glad what happened, happened.	Edzɔ dzi nam be nusi dzɔ la, dzɔ.
Nice to meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam be medo go wò.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
But that’s what it is.	Gake emae nye ema.
They have nothing.	Naneke mele wo si o.
It’s not possible for anyone.	Menye nusi ate ŋu anɔ anyi na ame aɖeke o.
Besides this, no one knew we were here.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe esia ŋu la, ame aɖeke menya be míele afisia o.
Here, during the day, there is a market.	Le afisia, le ŋkeke me la, asi aɖe nɔa anyi.
I have had enough.	Mekpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ nam.
He had never felt that way before.	Mese le eɖokui me nenema kpɔ o.
This is a difficult issue.	Esia nye nya sesẽ aɖe.
That seems pretty amazing.	Ema dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ ene.
He's not doing much right now.	Mele nu geɖe wɔm fifia o.
But this will be good.	Gake esia anyo.
There is a fire in it.	Dzo le eme.
You lost water last year, right?	Tsi bu na wò le ƒe si va yi me, alo?
However, he didn’t deserve it.	Ke hã, medze o.
That will take a little while.	Ema axɔ ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe.
This current season is as it is.	Fifia ƒe ɣeyiɣi sia le abe alesi wòle ene.
And the night before.	Eye le zã si do ŋgɔ me.
No one made my breakfast.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ nye ŋdi nuɖuɖu o.
I am really standing by him.	Mele eteƒe nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I wasn’t really sure what to do.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
We’re fine.	Míele nyuie.
I had far more important things on my mind.	Nu siwo le vevie wu kura la nɔ susu me nam.
Nice to finally meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò mlɔeba.
I could be wrong now.	Mate ŋu awɔ vodada fifia.
I fucked him.	Me fu nɛ.
Waste of an hour.	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka ƒe gbegblẽ.
I had a lot of fun.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ geɖe.
In this case, unlike this time.	Le go sia me la, to vovo na ɣeyiɣi sia.
There is no one else there.	Ame bubu aɖeke mele afima o.
That’s enough.	Ema sɔ gbɔ.
And there is a problem.	Eye kuxi aɖe hã le eme.
For his face.	Na eƒe mo.
Not at all.	Menye nenema kura o.
And do a good job at that.	Eye wɔ dɔ nyuie le ema me.
I can try that.	Mate ŋu ate ema kpɔ.
We all know where we are.	Mí katã míenya afisi míele.
Now, there are two types.	Fifia, ƒomevi eve li.
That’s just the job.	Dɔa koe nye ema.
I never owned a house of my own.	Nye ŋutɔ nye aƒe aɖeke menɔ asinye kpɔ o.
I had no home to go to, not in life or death.	Aƒe aɖeke menɔ asinye mayi o, menye le agbe alo ku me o.
I’ve always been that kind of person.	Nyee nye ame ma ƒomevi ɣesiaɣi.
It’s a huge waste of money.	Enye ga gbegblẽ gã aɖe.
That’s your idea!.	Emae nye wò susu!.
It’s a normal part of you.	Enye wò ŋutɔŋutɔ ƒe akpa si sɔ.
I didn’t feel like myself.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me abe nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye ene o.
This room is warm.	Xɔ sia me xɔ dzo.
There is no one there.	Ame aɖeke mele afima o.
Include only the most important information.	Gblɔ nya siwo le vevie wu la ko ɖe eme.
There was no wind.	Ya aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
My whole life was under there, it seemed.	Nye agbe bliboa nɔ afima te, edze abe.
I was ready.	Menɔ klalo.
We cannot live without food.	Míate ŋu anɔ agbe nuɖuɖu manɔmee o.
There is some truth in that.	Nyateƒe aɖe le nya ma me.
But something seems to be wrong.	Gake edze abe nane gblẽ ene.
This represents a balanced system.	Esia tsi tre ɖi na ɖoɖo si da sɔ.
I didn’t know he was there until the fact.	Nyemenya be ele afima o vaseɖe esime nyateƒea dzɔ.
He will do the same for you.	Awɔ nenema ke na wò hã.
We were very excited.	Dzi dzɔ mí ŋutɔ.
I have to do this.	Ele be mawɔ esia.
Ask questions about them.	Bia nya tso wo ŋu.
Respect everyone.	De bubu ame sia ame ŋu.
It’s one of them.	Enye ɖeka.
Or you’re going to die.	Alo èle kuku ge.
I did a lot of work.	Mewɔ dɔ geɖe.
He never wanted me to.	Medi be mawɔe gbeɖe o.
His voice was steady now.	Eƒe gbe nɔ teƒe ɖeka fifia.
It just doesn’t matter.	Ðeko mehiã o.
I don’t want to talk about this.	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso nya sia ŋu o.
They are way too small.	Wole sue akpa ŋutɔ.
He just has a big heart.	Ðeko dzi gã aɖe le esi.
I'm going to talk.	Mele nu ƒom.
And there is no.	Eye meli o.
None of them could help him.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mete ŋu kpe ɖe eŋu o.
And we can work with people.	Eye míate ŋu awɔ dɔ kple amewo.
We don’t have that situation here.	Nɔnɔme ma mele mía si le afisia o.
Just do whatever you feel you need to do.	Ðeko nàwɔ nusianu si nèsusu be ele be yeawɔ.
You can’t rule out the possibility.	Màte ŋu agbe nusi ate ŋu adzɔ o.
I touched my face and felt no more blood.	Meka asi nye mo eye mese le ɖokuinye me be ʋu aɖeke megale ŋunye o.

We haven’t had any money for two months.	Ɣleti eve enye sia si ga mele mía si o.
But it’s not that easy.	Gake mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.

He tried to work out what to do.	Edze agbagba be yeawɔ dɔ tso nusi yeawɔ ŋu.
And that’s important.	Eye ema le vevie.
Here we do not have a strong police force.	Le afisia la, kpovitɔwo ƒe ha sesẽ aɖeke mele mía si o.
It wasn’t easy at all.	Menɔ bɔbɔe kura o.
That’s my bad thing.	Emae nye nye nu gbegblẽ.
We are having a wonderful time.	Míele ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe ɖum.
But two problems arose.	Gake kuxi eve do mo ɖa.
The meeting was brief.	Kpekpea nɔ kpuie.
He didn’t marry anyone.	Meɖe ame aɖeke o.
That’s why these two words are so simple.	Esia tae nya eve siawo le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ ɖo.
He just couldn’t stand it. 	Ðeko mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o. 
Someone was watching them.	Ame aɖe nɔ wo kpɔm.
Always.	Ɣesiaɣi.
This isn’t going to hurt.	Esia mele nu gblẽ ge o.
However, it is not.	Ke hã, mele alea o.
Two eyes, two ears.	Ŋku eve, to eve.
Cops, man.	Kpovitɔwo, ŋutsu.
Each of them is right.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ƒe nya sɔ.
You know what needs to be done.	Ènya nusi wòle be woawɔ.
If money is not a problem,	Ne ga menye kuxi o la, .
The, the, the!.	Di, di, di!.
They are easy to find.	Wo didi le bɔbɔe.
This is also an honor.	Esia hã nye bubu.
You still have a chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gakpɔtɔ li na wò.
Still, it never seemed to bother him.	Ke hã, edze abe meɖe fu nɛ kpɔ o ene.
I have known a few.	Menya ame ʋɛ aɖewo kpɔ.
There is still much work to be done.	Dɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.
Someone who scores the last goal.	Ame aɖe si ƒoa go mamlɛtɔ.
The result will happen.	Nusi ado tso eme la adzɔ.
This is a good news.	Nya nyui aɖee nye esia.
What advice can he give?	Aɖaŋu kae wòate ŋu aɖo?
It is in all of us.	Ele mí katã me.
Everything has to be in place and now it is.	Ele be nusianu nanɔ teƒe si wòle eye fifia ele nenema.
I treated him very kindly and did not oppose him.	Mewɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu nyuie ŋutɔ eye metsi tre ɖe eŋu o.
There is another point for my side.	Nya bubu aɖe hã li na nye akpa dzi.
You don’t have a job.	Dɔ aɖeke mele asiwò o.
We know that nothing bad will happen.	Míenya be nu gbegblẽ aɖeke mado tso eme o.
The car is not very expensive.	Ʋua mexɔ asi boo o.
How long will his wind last? 	Ɣeyiɣi didi kae eƒe ya anɔ anyi?
If you have any questions for us, please ask them.	Ne nya aɖewo le asiwò na mí la, taflatse bia wo.
If it’s a man.	Ne ŋutsu aɖee.
He would believe that.	Axɔ nya ma dzi ase.
The truth is never that simple.	Nyateƒea mele bɔbɔe alea gbegbe gbeɖe o.
All on my own.	Wo katã le ɖokuinye si.
After all, he is one of us.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye mía dometɔ ɖeka.
I can't seem to get it to work very well.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ nyuie tututu o ene.
This is a very good one.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ.
That would be two.	Ema anye eve.
This doesn’t feel like home.	Esia mese le eɖokui me abe aƒe ene o.
I hope to see you soon.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ wò kpuie.
Death can happen within hours.	Ku ate ŋu adzɔ le gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo ko me.
This book is really interesting.	Agbalẽ sia doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I have made my point.	Megblɔ nye nya la.
John was late for the meeting.	John va tsi megbe le kpekpea me.
I didn’t have to do anything that night.	Mehiã be mawɔ naneke le zã ma me o.
I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
He can understand, of course.	Ate ŋu ase egɔme ya.
This is not an easy task.	Esia menye dɔ bɔbɔe o.
Everything that is going on.	Nusianu si le edzi yim.
I heard his voice.	Mese eƒe gbe.
He can go.	Ate ŋu ayi.
No food for two days.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke manɔ anyi ŋkeke eve o.
But there was one problem.	Gake kuxi ɖeka aɖe nɔ anyi.
Look at how we are doing.	Kpɔ ale si míele ɖa.
It’s very, very painful.	Eve ame ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
I said he could go.	Megblɔ be ate ŋu ayi.
The opposite happened.	Nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ.
This is usually true.	Zi geɖe la, esia nye nyateƒe.
I also received many.	Mexɔ geɖe hã.
And too unrealistic at the same time.	Eye menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o akpa le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me.
But I became different.	Gake meva to vovo.
We will do everything as one.	Míawɔ nusianu abe ɖeka ene.
For that, he was pleased.	Le ema ta la, edzɔ dzi nɛ.
One simply cannot have that moment.	Ðeko ame mate ŋu akpɔ ɣeyiɣi ma o.
This wasn’t on them.	Esia menɔ wo dzi o.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
But, not really.	Gake, menye le nyateƒe me o.
A kind of.	Ƒomevi aɖe.
There was something about it that bothered me.	Nane nɔ eŋu si ɖe fu nam.
This is a simple task.	Esia nye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖe.
They rarely have either.	Ƒã hafi wo dometɔ aɖeke nɔa wo si.
I am in one now.	Mele ɖeka me fifia.
I know what he likes.	Menya nusi dzɔa dzi nɛ.
If anyone was there, he couldn’t go.	Ne ame aɖeke nɔ afima la, mate ŋu ayi o.
I never wanted to be like that.	Nyemedi gbeɖe be manɔ nenema o.
I was interested in every one of them.	Metsɔ ɖe le wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe me.
There’s a lot going on with it.	Nu geɖe le edzi yim le eŋu.
Always just this one time.	Ɣesiaɣi la, ɣeyiɣi ɖeka sia koe.
Some schools only operate at one time.	Suku aɖewo wɔa dɔ le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me ko.
This was becoming serious.	Esia va nɔ vevie dom nu.
That could stand its current form.	Ema ate ŋu anɔ te ɖe eƒe nɔnɔme si li fifia nu.
But, think about it.	Gake, bu eŋu kpɔ.
There is no issue with that.	Nya aɖeke meli le ema ŋu o.
It could have been so much better.	Ate ŋu anyo wu nenema gbegbe hafi.
I stayed for a while.	Menɔ anyi vie.
Only the first one happened.	Gbãtɔ koe dzɔ.
I want to see more of that.	Medi be makpɔ nu geɖe tso ema ŋu.
Be angry with us.	Do dziku ɖe mía ŋu.
It’s not reasonable, it’s not normal.	Menye nusi me susu le o, menye nusi sɔ o.
I almost fell over.	Medze anyi kloe.
How many people can say that?.	Ame nenie ate ŋu agblɔ nya ma?.
I have a job to do.	Dɔ aɖe le asinye.
Almost bled out, though.	Ʋu do go kloe, ke hã.
Everyone is waiting there.	Amesiame le lalam le afima.
It’s everything to us at this point.	Enye nusianu na mí le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
But this is important.	Gake esia le vevie.
Nothing could have gone better.	Naneke mate ŋu adzɔ nyuie wu ema o.
And part of the night.	Eye zã la ƒe akpa aɖe hã.
Another issue regarding tonight seems to be on them.	Edze abe nya bubu si ku ɖe zã sia ŋu la le wo dzi ene.
But there was no time for that.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi na ema o.
I need to talk to him.	Ele be maƒo nu kplii.
This city is beautiful.	Du sia nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
The result was negative.	Nusi do tso eme la nye nu gbegblẽ.
I had never heard of him, had no idea who he was.	Nyemese eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ o, nyemenya amesi wònye o.
It’s only been a year today.	Ƒe ɖeka koe nye esia egbea.
Why is it so slow?	Nukatae wòle alea?
I did it with that in mind.	Mewɔe kple nya ma le susu me nam.
I think everyone knows that.	Mesusu be amesiame nya esia.
Some of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo.
It was a good job though.	Dɔ nyui aɖee wònye gake.
But that’s a good thing.	Gake nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
He has something for us.	Nu aɖe le esi na mí.
I tried to tell you that.	Medze agbagba be magblɔ nya ma na mi.
We have a job to do.	Dɔ aɖe le mía si wòle be míawɔ.
Tell them what you are doing.	Gblɔ nusi wɔm nèle la na wo.
Please have a manya!.	Taflatse na manya!.
He's probably there now.	Anɔ eme be ele afima fifia.
Now that path is short too.	Fifia mɔ ma hã le kpuie.
He is not busy at all.	Vovo mele eŋu kura o.
He does what he has never done before.	Mewɔa nusi mewɔ kpɔ o.
I tried to stay that way.	Medze agbagba be manɔ nenema.
Not so well.	Menye nyuie nenema gbegbe o.
I heard it myself last night.	Nye ŋutɔ mese eƒe gbe le zã si va yi me.
I am your teacher.	Nyee nye wò nufiala.
I have to do this for me.	Ele be mawɔ esia nam.
There was never anything great.	Nu gã aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
This didn’t surprise me, but it did.	Esia mewɔ nuku nam o, gake ewɔ nuku nam.
After that, everything is working fine.	Le ema megbe la, nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie.
He was a good dog.	Avu nyui aɖee wònye.
I could have done without it.	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔe nenema manɔmee hafi.
Just a little bit.	Susu aɖe ko.
I had a little fun today.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ vie egbea.
I am looking for a way.	Mele mɔ aɖe dim.
I was looking for something.	Menɔ nane dim.
It will happen automatically.	Adzɔ le eɖokui si.
Once you decide on the components.	Ne ènya tso nya me le akpa siwo le eme ŋu ko la.
Or your place.	Alo wò teƒe.
But please, please come back tomorrow.	Gake taflatse, taflatse trɔ va etsɔ.
I have a lot of things.	Nu geɖe le asinye.
There was much else to do.	Nu bubu geɖe hã nɔ anyi woawɔ.
Or one day.	Alo ŋkeke ɖeka.
There are many people in this city.	Ame geɖe le du sia me.
This was not easy for him.	Esia menɔ bɔbɔe nɛ o.
He didn’t like it.	Eƒe nu medze eŋu o.
I remember the good old days.	Meɖo ŋku ŋkeke nyui siwo nɔ anyi tsã la dzi.
Nothing will ever get his way.	Naneke mawɔ eƒe mɔ gbeɖe o.

But it’s only temporary.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖe koe.
This is not necessary.	Esia mehiã o.
It’s weird, but it’s true.	Ewɔ nuku, gake enye nyateƒe.
He had only one thing.	Nu ɖeka koe nɔ esi.
Beware of them.	Kpɔ nyuie le wo ŋu.
I want to get out of here.	Medi be mado le afisia.
Please be patient.	Taflatse gbɔ dzi ɖi.
Now that is amazing.	Fifia ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Hand over the money quickly.	Tsɔ ga la de asi kaba.
As he spoke, his dog approached him.	Esi wònɔ nu ƒom la, eƒe avu la te ɖe eŋu.
He also had a lot of heart.	Dzi geɖe hã nɔ esi.
You are.	Ènye.
He was the only one who lived.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ agbe.
It was never an issue.	Menye nya aɖeke gbeɖe o.
Someone important is unhappy.	Ame aɖe si le vevie la mekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
And that’s what makes it.	Eye emae wɔe be.
Or something like that, anyway.	Alo nane si le abe ema ene, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Maybe not ever.	Ðewohĩ menye gbeɖe o.
I only did it a few times.	Zi ʋɛ aɖewo koe mewɔe.
I’m not doing any work.	Nyemele dɔ aɖeke wɔm o.
This happened.	Esia dzɔ.
It was too quick.	Ewɔ kaba akpa.
I couldn't find anything on it.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe naneke ŋu le edzi o.
He didn't hear anything.	Mese naneke o.
I think that’s his heart.	Mesusu be emae nye eƒe dzi.
I knew he would do great.	Menya be awɔ nu gã aɖe.
This makes no sense to me.	Susu aɖeke mele nya sia ŋu nam o.
Take a look at us.	Lé ŋku ɖe mía ŋu.
A man answered him.	Ŋutsu aɖe ɖo eŋu nɛ.
I did great, actually.	Mewɔ nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
It’s like a hole.	Ele abe do aɖe ene.
In some cases, it’s pretty clear.	Le go aɖewo me la, eme kɔ nyuie.
You have a reason.	Susu aɖe le asiwò.
I glanced at the back of the room.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe xɔa ƒe megbe.
He escaped from the house.	Esi le aƒea me.
I am working really hard.	Mele dɔ wɔm sesĩe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s just that, too.	Ðeko wòle nenema hã.
It will be easier in many ways.	Anɔ bɔbɔe wu le mɔ geɖe nu.
Everyone else does too.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã wɔa esia.
In fact, maybe you can help too.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ wò hã àte ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu.
People know us.	Amewo nya mí.
I'm not making that up.	Menye ɖe mele nya ma wɔm o.
It could be my trap.	Ate ŋu anye nye mɔ̃.
This just added more excitement to the room.	Ðeko esia na dzidzɔ geɖe wu va xɔa me.
Not sure what else to do here.	Nyemeka ɖe nu bubu si mawɔ le afisia dzi o.
He will tell you that it is true.	Agblɔ na wò be enye nyateƒe.
I can give you anything you want, reasonably.	Mate ŋu ana nusianu si nèdi la na wò, le susu me.
Could it be this?.	Ðe wòate ŋu anye esia?.
These things are very difficult.	Nu siawo sesẽ ŋutɔ.
In fact, this is possible.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia anya wɔ.
I never really liked the word.	Nya la medze ŋunye ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o.
There’s a little trick to be had here.	Aɖaŋu vi aɖe li si wòle be woawɔ le afisia.
That’s very interesting at the moment.	Ema doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
It can go up.	Ate ŋu ayi dzi.
There would have been the same time.	Anye ne ɣeyiɣi ma ke anɔ anyi.
He had made a mistake.	Ewɔ vodada aɖe kpɔ.
. . . .	.
I can say it happened, get that money.	Mate ŋu agblɔ be edzɔ, xɔ ga ma.
But I couldn’t stand it.	Gake nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
No one was more interested in his work.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖe le eƒe dɔa me wu ema o.
King looked at the others here.	Fia lé ŋku ɖe ame bubu siwo le afisia ŋu.
Nothing did, for what seemed like a long time.	Naneke mewɔe o, le nusi dze abe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ene ta.
He has only one way.	Mɔ ɖeka koe le esi.
You have a certain amount of time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe le asiwò.
That should work.	Ele be ema nawɔ dɔ.
Without water there would be no life.	Tsi manɔmee la, agbe manɔ anyi o.
There is no reason for that.	Susu aɖeke meli si tae wòle nenema ɖo o.
He didn’t look away.	Meɖe ŋku ɖa o.
I don’t know how he put up with it.	Nyemenya ale si wòwɔ do dzi le eme o.
He stuck out his tongue.	Etsɔ eƒe aɖe do ɖe eŋu.
Change your mind.	Trɔ wò susu.
I don’t have the money.	Ga mele asinye o.
It's like this.	Ele alea.
None of these things are here.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke mele afisia o.
None of these people asked to be in this situation.	Ame siawo dometɔ aɖeke mebia be yeanɔ nɔnɔme sia me o.
It’s actually quite a challenge.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye kuxi gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
And it is working well.	Eye ele dɔ wɔm nyuie.
It can be a great thing.	Ate ŋu anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can’t tell you anything else.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya bubu aɖeke na wò o.
He had done his job well.	Ewɔ eƒe dɔa nyuie kpɔ.
He was a great guy.	Enye ŋutsu gã aɖe.
I just felt that.	Ðeko mese le ɖokuinye me be.
No one will see us.	Ame aɖeke makpɔ mí o.
This was very important to me.	Esia nɔ vevie nam ŋutɔ.
Everyone could have seen it from there.	Amesiame ate ŋu akpɔ eme tso afima hafi.
I am looking forward to that day.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie na ŋkeke ma.
It started out so well.	Edze egɔme nyuie ale gbegbe.
This surprised me a lot.	Esia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
It’s a normal thing.	Enye nusi sɔ.
I didn’t have time for it.	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye ɖe eŋu o.
And I did it.	Eye mewɔe.
Leave that to me.	Gblẽ nya ma ɖe asinye.
He was just a man.	Ŋutsu koe wònye.
A long time passed this way.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe va yi le mɔ sia nu.
I received the same.	Mexɔ nenema ke.
Yet it has happened.	Ke hã edzɔ kpɔ.
And so he would work as hard as he could.	Eye ale wòawɔ dɔ sesĩe alesi wòate ŋui.
It’s a song.	Enye ha aɖe.
Yet only one side wants to do something about it.	Ke hã akpa ɖeka koe di be yeawɔ nane tso eŋu.
Any idea how I can achieve that.	Susu ɖesiaɖe aleke mawɔ aɖo ema gbɔ.
I can do either one.	Mate ŋu awɔ wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
This is something completely different.	Esia nye nusi to vovo kura.
Nothing has stuck yet.	Naneke meli si lé ɖe te haɖe o.
But that is impossible.	Gake ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
However, you are here now.	Ke hã, èle afisia fifia.
That little thing is nice.	Nu sue ma nyo ŋutɔ.
This is the only difference.	Esia koe to vovo.
I might lose my job.	Ate ŋu adzɔ be dɔ ge le asinye.
No smoke in your room or apartment.	Dzudzɔ aɖeke manɔ wò xɔ alo xɔa me o.
This seems strange.	Esia dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ene.
I felt like I didn’t feel for them.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mese le ɖokuinye me ɖe wo ŋu o.
I was very excited.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
The cake is standing.	Ga kuku le eme.
Water stirred up water.	Tsi ƒoa tsi.
It was just a matter of finding him.	Eya didi ƒe nya koe wònye.

The house is beautiful.	Aƒea me nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
There was just something completely different.	Nusi to vovo kura koe nɔ anyi.
The same can be true here.	Nenema ate ŋu anɔ le afisia hã.
I can’t stand something like that.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe nane si le abe ema ene nu o.
This is not unreasonable.	Esia menye nusi me susu mele o.
There is no way.	Mɔ aɖeke meli o.
One can do it back and forth.	Ame ate ŋu awɔe yi ŋgɔ kple megbe.
I was very interested in him.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ ŋutɔ.
He said nothing else and asked no questions.	Megblɔ nya bubu aɖeke o eye mebia nya aɖeke hã o.
I think that was important.	Mesusu be ema nɔ vevie.
I don’t have much water left.	Tsi geɖe megale asinye o.
I would like to know what you think about it.	Madi be manya nusi nèsusu tso eŋu.
Life or death.	Agbe alo ku.
He made a plan.	Ewɔ ɖoɖo aɖe.

This is really amazing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And the most likely.	Eye esi ate ŋu adzɔ wu.
But he didn’t listen.	Gake meɖo to o.
Actually, that is the first way.	Le nyateƒe me la, emae nye mɔ gbãtɔ.
He has a hand in everything.	Eƒe asi le nusianu me.
That quickly became clear.	Ema me kɔ ƒã kaba.
That’s pretty clear.	Ema me kɔ nyuie.
To actually work.	Be woawɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
With that kind of mindset, you can’t see reality.	Ne susu ma ƒomevi le asiwò la, màte ŋu akpɔ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
It was a tense hour.	Enye gaƒoƒo si me nu te ɖe ame dzi le.
I guarantee you a good job at a cheap price.	Meka ɖe edzi na wò be nàwɔ dɔ nyuie le asi bɔbɔe aɖe dzi.

But here, here, there was something.	Gake le afisia, le afisia la, nane nɔ anyi.
Everyone just called.	Ðeko amesiame ƒo ka.
When did you want this?	Ɣekaɣie nèdi esia?

And that was fine.	Eye esia nɔ nyuie.
Most of the time he didn’t touch me.	Zi geɖe la, meka asi ŋunye o.

Let me meet you somewhere.	Na mado go wò le afi aɖe.
Life is hard.	Agbe sesẽ.

No one was waiting for us there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ mía lalam le afima o.

I was angry.	Medo dziku.
It wouldn’t surprise me.	Mawɔ nuku nam o.

What may work for one person may not work for another.	Ðewohĩ nusi ate ŋu awɔ dɔ na ame aɖe mawɔ dɔ na ame bubu o.
It is like a living clay.	Ele abe anyi si le agbe ene.

I missed you, too.	Mesusu wò hã.
Man knows he knows.	Ŋutsu nya be yenya.
I am very serious now.	Mele vevie dom nu ŋutɔ fifia.
There are probably two reasons for this.	Ðewohĩ susu eve aɖewo tae wòle nenema ɖo.
Therefore, we.	Eya ta, mí.
All of these things are important to me.	Nu siawo katã le vevie nam.
He didn’t answer.	Meɖo eŋu o.
Or maybe it’s you.	Alo ɖewohĩ wòe.
Just think about what you are doing.	Bu nu si wɔm nèle ŋu ko.
The apartment was very comfortable with plenty of space.	Xɔa me nyo ŋutɔ eye teƒe geɖe nɔ eme.
I like everyone.	Amesiame dzɔa dzi nam.
I told you that before.	Megblɔ nya ma na wò do ŋgɔ.
This is only part of his wrongdoing.	Eƒe nu gbegblẽ siwo wòwɔ ƒe akpa aɖe koe nye esia.
We don’t know anything about it.	Míenya naneke tso eŋu o.
I tried to speak sense.	Medze agbagba be maƒo nu si me susu le.
That’s a great thing.	Nu gã aɖee nye ema.
What’s in it, and how do we know?.	Nukae le eme, eye aleke míawɔ anya?.
Fire in his car!	Dzo le eƒe ʋua me!
Or consider the law.	Alo bu se ŋu kpɔ.
I did it and it worked.	Mewɔe eye wòwɔ dɔ.
This one is gathering dust.	Ame sia le ke ƒom ƒu.
This can be frustrating.	Esia ate ŋu ate ɖe ame dzi.
Something had to be done.	Ele be woawɔ nane.
Without it, none of us would be alive.	Eya manɔmee la, mía dometɔ aɖeke manɔ agbe o.
The blood.	Ʋu la.
I told him my opinion.	Megblɔ nye susu nɛ.
I think a lot of people do that sort of thing.	Mesusu be ame geɖe wɔa nu ma ƒomevi.
Not just one other person either.	Menye ame bubu ɖeka ko hã o.
I didn’t know you could do this.	Nyemenya be àte ŋu awɔ esia o.
Which is the truth.	Nusi nye nyateƒe.
Everything else could be.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
This raises a number of serious problems.	Esia fɔ kuxi sesẽ geɖe ɖe te.
I don’t want them.	Nyemedi wo o.
If they are, great.	Ne wole nenema la, ke gã.
It’s not a difficult thing.	Menye nu sesẽ o.
No one realized how important it was.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ ale si gbegbe wòle vevie la dze sii o.
That thing will kill you.	Nu ma awu wò.
Before that, he had no idea.	Do ŋgɔ na ema la, susu aɖeke menɔ esi o.
This part is no longer important.	Akpa sia megale vevie o.
Get in the mood.	Dze dɔme.
It wasn’t easy before.	Menɔ bɔbɔe tsã o.
Yet there was a truth there.	Ke hã nyateƒe aɖe nɔ afima.
He needed the money.	Ehiã ga la.
What can one say about that.	Nukae ame ate ŋu agblɔ tso nya ma ŋu.
He didn’t answer at once.	Meɖo eŋu zi ɖeka o.
Write down each of them.	Ŋlɔ wo dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe ɖi.
None of them did that.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
Death with him.	Ku kplii.
That means a lot.	Ema fia nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
He did a great job the first year or two.	Ewɔ dɔ gã aɖe le ƒe gbãtɔ alo eve me.
Two weeks later, the money was still missing.	Kwasiɖa eve megbe la, ga la gakpɔtɔ bu.
Take that away.	Tsɔ nya ma ɖa.
Maybe he made a mistake.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ vodada.
That’s an opportunity.	Emae nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe.
He never told us this!	Megblɔ nya sia na mí kpɔ o!
Night is set.	Zã ɖo.
He was an incredible man.	Enye ame si mewɔ nuku o.
I felt satisfied.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme.
There is a reason for it.	Susu aɖe li si tae.
I would have expected that.	Anye ne mekpɔ mɔ nenema hafi.
As it was, it was.	Abe alesi wònɔ ene.
There is absolutely no reason.	Susu aɖeke kura meli o.
There is no mistake.	Vodada aɖeke meli o.
His name wasn’t familiar to him.	Eƒe ŋkɔ menya nyuie nɛ o.
I let it go.	Meɖe asi le eŋu.
It’s just an idea now.	Susu aɖe koe wònye fifia.
This is usually not a problem.	Zi geɖe la, esia menye kuxi o.
That that happened.	Be ema dzɔ.
This very nearly works.	Esia wɔa dɔ kloe ŋutɔ.
A bad month, that was it.	Ɣleti gbegblẽ aɖee, emae nye ema.
Some people may lose their jobs.	Ame aɖewo ate ŋu ana dɔ ge le wo si.
He had blood on him.	Ʋu nɔ eŋu.
That’s different now, too.	Ema hã to vovo fifia.
I am familiar with these cars.	Menya nu tso ʋu siawo ŋu nyuie.
They are all still here.	Wo katã gakpɔtɔ le afisia.
I can impress people.	Mete ŋu wɔa dɔ ɖe amewo dzi.
My car just ran over her dog.	Ðeko nye ʋua ƒu du to eƒe avu dzi.
He doesn’t have a dog.	Avu aɖeke mele esi o.
He wasn't too sure what he was doing.	Meka ɖe nu si wɔm wònɔ la dzi boo o.
I didn’t have any money.	Ga aɖeke menɔ asinye o.
There is no house quite like it anywhere else.	Aƒe aɖeke meli si sɔ kple esia tututu le teƒe bubu aɖeke o.
None of us have anything left.	Naneke megale mía dometɔ aɖeke si o.
He clearly has a bad attitude.	Edze ƒã be nɔnɔme gbegblẽ aɖe le eŋu.
A hand flew up.	Asi aɖe dzo yi dzi.
It’s smart, too.	Edze aɖaŋu, eya hã.
This would have been nice.	Esia anyo hafi.
It won’t work.	Mawɔ dɔ o.
I am the only one here.	Nye ɖeka koe le afisia.
And so it is.	Eye nenema ke.
I’ve seen that one before.	Mekpɔ ɖeka ma kpɔ.
I can talk to anyone about anything.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu tso nusianu ŋu na ame sia ame.
This is for everything.	Esia nye nusianu tɔ.
That will take care of everything.	Ema akpɔ nusianu gbɔ.
No one can deny or deny this.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu agbe esia alo agbe eme o.
Ask for his name.	Bia eƒe ŋkɔ.
I don’t want to talk to you.	Nyemedi be maƒo nu na wò o.
I can actually do it.	Mate ŋui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He can’t do that.	Mate ŋu awɔe nenema o.
I had to act quickly.	Ele be mawɔ nu kaba.
Who can help me?	Amekae ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye?
None of these statements support this claim.	Nya siawo dometɔ aɖeke meɖo kpe nya sia dzi o.
You are my joy.	Wòe nye nye dzidzɔ.
You can work alone.	Wò ɖeka ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
This doesn’t do anything.	Esia mewɔa naneke o.
I think that kid has come into his own.	Mesusu be ɖevi ma va ɖo eya ŋutɔ tɔ me.
I was very, very happy.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
It’s not easy, of course.	Mele bɔbɔe ya o.
You’re not feeling well anymore.	Wò lãme megale nyuie o.
It will be fine.	Anɔ nyuie.
We know what to do.	Míenya nusi míawɔ.
It is that clear.	Eme kɔ nenema gbegbe.
Something fell on him.	Nane dze anyi ɖe edzi.
But that guy was so finished.	Gake ŋutsu ma wu enu ale gbegbe.
It has been bothering me for about a year.	Anɔ abe ƒe ɖeka ene enye sia si wòle fu ɖem nam.
This place is amazing.	Teƒe sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It was enough for the four of us.	Mí ame ene koe sɔ gbɔ na mí.
I can’t get any right now.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ ɖeke fifia o.
A great man.	Ŋutsu gã aɖe.
Stand up, challenge, do what you want.	Tsi tre, tsɔ nya ɖe ŋuwò, wɔ nusi nèdi.
He wouldn’t want me to call him.	Madi be maƒo ka na ye o.
I don’t really know how to go about this.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ ayi esia me ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Come on, just trust me.	Va, ka ɖe dzinye ko.
It's just running in the wrong direction.	Ðeko wòle du dzi le mɔ gbegblẽ dzi.
This situation is not new.	Nɔnɔme sia menye nu yeye o.
There was no time for more.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi na nu geɖe wu o.
I was very excited.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
He was just in a position.	Ðeko wònɔ nɔnɔme aɖe me.
This was the case.	Esia nɔ nenema.
You don’t know his name yet.	Mènya eƒe ŋkɔ haɖe o.
I want to do things for myself.	Medi be mawɔ nuwo na ɖokuinye.
For each of us.	Na mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
I would expect them to do that.	Makpɔ mɔ be woawɔ ema.
There is no substitute for that.	Naneke meli si axɔ ɖe ema teƒe o.
It’s obvious to me now.	Edze ƒã nam fifia.
We are always working	Míele dɔ wɔm ɣesiaɣi
But only a little bit.	Gake vi aɖe koe.
I'm going to get my gun.	Mele nye tu la xɔ ge.
They are on the road.	Wole mɔ dzi.
That was the first reason.	Emae nye susu gbãtɔ.
I doubt anything will come of it.	Meke ɖi be naneke ado tso eme.
Something that needs to be done at once.	Nane si wòle be woawɔ zi ɖeka.
You know you want one.	Ènya be yedi ɖeka.
But he never said much.	Gake megblɔ nya geɖe kpɔ o.
And this will happen often.	Eye esia adzɔ zi geɖe.
I just sat there.	Ðeko menɔ anyi ɖe afima.
Anger arose.	Dziku do mo ɖa.
But if only.	Gake ne ɖe.
We can travel.	Míate ŋu azɔ mɔ.
Ask more questions about that person.	Bia nya geɖe tso ame ma ŋu.
Some of them are private.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
That was very exciting for me.	Ema do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
It’s all still so fresh.	Wo katã gakpɔtɔ le yeye ale gbegbe.
You are not the first.	Menye wòe nye ame gbãtɔ o.
He did it accordingly.	Ewɔ ɖe edzi.
I came to tell you something.	Meva be magblɔ nya aɖe na wò.
I got this, this morning.	Mexɔ esia, ŋdi sia.
This can’t be that.	Esia mate ŋu anye ema o.
He never does this.	Mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
Kind of before any of us knew.	Ƒomevi aɖe do ŋgɔ na mía dometɔ aɖeke nya.
Relax!	Gbɔ dzi ɖi!
It has only been bothering me for a month.	Ɣleti ɖeka koe nye esia wòle fu ɖem nam.
The work is very stressful.	Dɔa te ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
I am a new system now.	Menye ɖoɖo yeye aɖe fifia.
I couldn’t stop thinking about it.	Nyemete ŋu dzudzɔ eŋu bubu o.
But that didn’t feel much like the truth either.	Gake ema hã mese le eɖokui me abe nyateƒea ene boo o.
It was too much at once.	Enye nu geɖe akpa zi ɖeka.
It will never be like that.	Manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
But I was impressed with the whole thing.	Gake nya bliboa wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
Just a day or two.	Ŋkeke ɖeka alo eve ko.
The project took years.	Dɔa wɔwɔ xɔ ƒe geɖe.
There is too much that can burn.	Nu geɖe akpa li si ate ŋu axɔ dzo.
This took a lot of time.	Esia xɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe ŋutɔ.
I already have some ideas.	Susu aɖewo le asinye xoxo.

It’s a matter of time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya.
There is a logic, a plan.	Susu aɖe le eme, si nye ɖoɖo aɖe.
There was nothing here, nothing.	Naneke menɔ afisia o, naneke menɔ anyi o.
That was a surprise to us.	Ema wɔ nuku na mí ŋutɔ.
A little pause there.	Dzudzɔ vi aɖe le afima.
I had rarely been anywhere so beautiful.	Ƒã hafi menɔ afi aɖeke si nya kpɔ nenema gbegbe o.

I have a little one at home.	Vi aɖe le asinye le aƒeme.
And that really touched me.	Eye nya ma wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
I asked how long he had been there.	Mebia ɣeyiɣi didi kae wònɔ afima.
I know a guy.	Menya ŋutsu aɖe.
In your ears.	Le wò to me.
I want to experience that with you.	Medi be makpɔ ema teƒe kpli mi.
He lost an eye.	Ŋku aɖe bu nɛ.
That seems to work well.	Edze abe ema wɔa dɔ nyuie ene.
He is not a charming person.	Menye ame si ƒe nu lé dzi na ame o.
I’m not so sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o.
It’s not something new either.	Menye nu yeye aɖe hã o.
You've been in this city too long.	Èle du sia me ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.

What we know to be true is not true.	Nusi míenya be enye nyateƒe la menye nyateƒe o.

Everything in her house matters.	Nu ɖesiaɖe si le eƒe aƒe me la le vevie.
They were only a foot apart.	Afɔ ɖeka koe wo dome didi tso wo nɔewo gbɔ.

One man has a better chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ si nyo wu le ŋutsu ɖeka si.
Maybe it will be good.	Ðewohĩ anyo.
I don’t know the issue.	Nyemenya nya la o.
It is a focus on things.	Enye susu ɖe nu dzi.
The other is better.	Bubu la nyo wu.

Switch when you get tired.	Trɔ asi ne ɖeɖi te ŋuwò.
This should not necessarily be the case.	Mele be esia nanɔ nenema kokoko o.
In fact, it is something.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye nu aɖe.
But I liked the dog.	Gake avu la dze ŋunye.
I don’t understand anything that happened tonight.	Nyemese naneke si dzɔ le zã sia me gɔme o.

Yet, few people do.	Ke hã ame ʋɛ aɖewo ya wɔa esia.
It will help.	Akpe ɖe ame ŋu.
But no one knew what to do with it.	Gake ame aɖeke menya nusi wòawɔ ɖe eŋu o.
I think in the end they liked it.	Mesusu be mlɔeba la, edzɔ dzi na wo.
Like many before me.	Abe ame geɖe siwo do ŋgɔ nam ene.
We can’t keep going like this.	Míate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim alea o.
He didn’t know how to get to a new place.	Menya alesi wòawɔ aɖo teƒe yeye aɖe o.

I had to give up something.	Ele nam be maɖe asi le nane ŋu.

Perhaps there is another reason.	Ðewohĩ susu bubu aɖe hã li.
Just a better room.	Xɔ si nyo wu koe.
And a little under your eyes.	Eye vi aɖe le wò ŋku te.
Which is, is.	Nusi nye, nye.

He did not say where he was.	Megblɔ afi si wòle o.
No one has come to the house yet.	Ame aɖeke meva aƒea me haɖe o.
But it can be a mistake.	Gake ate ŋu anye vodada.
He can get another.	Ate ŋu akpɔ bubu.
I want to know.	Medi be manya.
That’s a very good thing.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ.
That’s easy.	Ema le bɔbɔe.

That was a very interesting time.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
He threw them away.	Etsɔ wo ƒu gbe.

Can you lend me some money?	Àte ŋu ado ga aɖe nam?
I just thought it was an interesting case.	Ðeko mesusu be enye nya si doa dzidzɔ nam.

You think you know what they’re doing.	Èsusu be yenya nusi wɔm wole.

There is a large freshwater lake nearby.	Ta gã aɖe si me tsi nyui le la te ɖe afima ŋu.
Many people got sick and starved.	Ame geɖe dze dɔ eye dɔ wu wo.

What is clear is that something has changed.	Nusi me kɔ enye be nane trɔ.

He couldn't understand what had just happened.	Mete ŋu se nusi dzɔ teti koe nye ema gɔme o.

He was kind of surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ le mɔ aɖe nu.

Everyone is equal.	Ame sia ame sɔ.
That could be it.	Ema ate ŋu anye.
That shouldn’t be there.	Mele be ema nanɔ afima o.
And this shouldn’t surprise us.	Eye mele be esia nawɔ nuku na mí o.
Death was as old as life itself.	Ku nɔ xoxo abe agbe ŋutɔ ene.
He was a really smart guy.	Enye ŋutsu si dze aɖaŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
At least a little bit.	Vi aɖe ya teti.
He is the only real one.	Eya ɖeka koe nye ame ɖeka ŋutɔŋutɔ.

Which is not true, of course.	Nusi menye nyateƒe o ya.

There is just something else.	Ðeko nu bubu aɖe hã li.
It can’t be true.	Mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
It didn’t last really long.	Menɔ anyi eteƒe didi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Maybe some things are just that way.	Ðewohĩ nu aɖewo le nenema ko.
It has done so much for me.	Ewɔ nu geɖe nam ŋutɔ.

That’s what made it.	Emae nye nusi wɔe.
I didn’t expect it.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ nɛ o.
He needs money.	Ehiã ga.
If necessary, get out of the house.	Ne ehiã la, do go le aƒea me.
And for your dog, too.	Eye na wò avu hã.
They are in great shape.	Wole nɔnɔme gã aɖe me.

There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eme o.

Two points stuck with me.	Nya eve aɖewo lé ɖe ŋunye.
He won’t do it.	Mawɔe o.

He couldn’t help himself.	Mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe eɖokui nu o.
Thank you so much, so much!.	Akpe na wò ŋutɔ, geɖe ŋutɔ!.

At that moment an idea came to me.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, susu aɖe va susu me nam.

That’s not what impressed me.	Menye emae wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye o.
And probably for a few reasons.	Eye ɖewohĩ susu ʋɛ aɖewo hã tae.
Or maybe before it.	Alo ɖewohĩ do ŋgɔ nɛ.
He probably didn’t.	Anɔ eme be mewɔe nenema o.
That’s about right.	Ema sɔ kple nusi sɔ.
It was the first day.	Enye ŋkeke gbãtɔ.
I'm the only one who.	Nye ɖeka si.
We’re glad he’s there.	Edzɔ dzi na mí be ele afima.
Best to keep this in mind.	Anyo wu be esia nanɔ susu me na wò.
Dispose of them thoroughly.	Tsɔ wo ƒu gbe nyuie.
He didn’t hear her voice at all.	Mese eƒe gbe kura o.
This is a one-month period.	Esia nye ɣleti ɖeka ƒe ɣeyiɣi.
Clearly, this is not yet true.	Edze ƒã be esia menye nyateƒe haɖe o.
Someone was at home.	Ame aɖe nɔ aƒeme.
Perhaps part of it is true.	Ðewohĩ eƒe akpa aɖe nye nyateƒe.
A week, maybe.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka, ɖewohĩ.
It’s impossible for anyone there to do anything differently.	Manya wɔ be ame aɖeke le afima nawɔ naneke le mɔ bubu nu o.
Nothing for days behind us.	Naneke meli ŋkeke geɖe le mía megbe o.
They’re just like everyone else.	Wole abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
Each one has a job.	Dɔ aɖe le wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe si.
I got one of them.	Mexɔ ɖeka.
It contained a very large gun.	Tu gã aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ eme.
I couldn’t have refused.	Nyemate ŋu agbe hafi o.
Something will happen tomorrow.	Nane adzɔ etsɔ.
Someone like that.	Ame aɖe si le abe ema ene.
Things like .	Nuwo abe .
You can get here.	Àte ŋu aɖo afisia.
It might have stayed that way for hours.	Ðewohĩ anɔ nenema gaƒoƒo geɖe hafi.
I could understand everything.	Mete ŋu se nusianu gɔme.
He never did anything wrong.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke kpɔ o.
He wasn’t there, of course.	Menɔ afima ya o.
I just did it.	Ðeko mewɔe.
But it didn’t last long.	Gake menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
For at least one way.	Na mɔ ɖeka ya teti.
Not just one thing missing, in my case.	Menye nu ɖeka ko si bu o, le nye nya me.
It seems to be working.	Edze abe ele dɔ wɔm ene.
That seems to be what everyone is interested in.	Edze abe emae nye nusi me amesiame tsɔ ɖe le ene.
And hair that was beautiful and once vibrant.	Eye ɖa si nya kpɔ eye wònɔ agbe tsã.
I used to be like that.	Menɔ nenema tsã.
Apparently plan is not one.	Edze abe ɖoɖo menye ɖeka o ene.
I know everything.	Menya nusianu.
I don’t know how they can do that.	Nyemenya alesi woawɔ ate ŋu awɔ ema o.
But live today.	Gake nɔ agbe egbea.
Your word is all that matters.	Wò nya koe le vevie.
That’s not surprising.	Ema mewɔ nuku o.
This outcome can be positive or negative.	Nusi ado tso eme sia ate ŋu anye nu nyui alo nu gbegblẽ.
I think that takes care of that.	Mesusu be ema kpɔa nya ma gbɔ.
Doing two jobs.	Dɔ eve wɔwɔ.
Many schools simply refused.	Ðeko suku geɖe gbe.
I can’t do this alone.	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔ esia o.
He gave me everything.	Etsɔ nusianu nam.
Finally, some good news.	Mlɔeba la, nya nyui aɖewo.
The end result .	Nusi ado tso eme mlɔeba .
But he missed home.	Gake aƒe to eŋu.
I think more people should be, actually.	Mesusu be ele be ame geɖe wu nanɔ nenema, le nyateƒe me.
This is a beautiful place.	Esia nye teƒe si nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
I don’t know if he will.	Nyemenya nenye be awɔe o.
This is a pretty big deal.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But it looks like one.	Gake edze abe ɖeka ene.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
It was everything though.	Enye nusianu gake.
And his own, too.	Eye eya ŋutɔ tɔ hã.
And it never will be.	Eye manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
This wouldn’t work the other way around.	Esia mawɔ dɔ le mɔ bubu nu o.
Now, hurry up!	Azɔ, wɔ kaba!
A few bad months, a few good ones.	Ɣleti gbegblẽ ʋɛ aɖewo, nyui ʋɛ aɖewo.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
It started before them.	Edze egɔme do ŋgɔ na wo.
Your doing this.	Wò esia wɔwɔ.
Nenema is	Nenema ke
Which is not always possible.	Nusi mate ŋu adzɔ ɣesiaɣi o.
To some extent, of course.	Va ɖo afi aɖe ya.
But of course it won’t be there.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, manɔ afima o.
This is for a number of reasons.	Esia le alea le susu geɖe ta.
This cannot be true.	Esia mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
A thread will have one or more of these moments.	Ka aɖe akpɔ ɣeyiɣi siawo dometɔ ɖeka alo esi wu nenema.
But look what happens in the next few years.	Gake kpɔ nusi adzɔ le ƒe ʋɛ siwo gbɔna me ɖa.
I thought that was just me.	Mesusu be nye koe nye ema.
I can talk.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu.
He doesn’t make mistakes or anything.	Mewɔa vodada alo naneke o.
There was something about what happened.	Nane nɔ nusi dzɔ la ŋu.
He was a strong man.	Ame sesẽ aɖee wònye.
I know everyone is very concerned about that.	Menya be amesiame tsi dzi ɖe ema ŋu vevie.
Everyone was angry with him.	Amesiame do dziku ɖe eŋu.
It was the body of a dead man.	Enye ame kuku aɖe ƒe kuku.
I just don’t understand what his long plan is.	Ðeko nyemese nusi eƒe ɖoɖo didi la nye gɔme o.
It will help us.	Akpe ɖe mía ŋu.
I was angry that someone could be like that.	Medo dziku be ame aɖe ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
He needs all the help he can get.	Ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu siwo katã wòate ŋu axɔ.
This better job.	Dɔ sia si nyo wu.
It’s a perfect fit.	Enye nusi sɔ nyuie.
But I'll be quick to get out of there.	Gake mawɔ kaba ado go le afima.
It could be anyone.	Ate ŋu anye amesiame.
But he couldn't remember where he was.	Gake mete ŋu ɖo ŋku afisi wònɔ dzi o.
There used to be a king there.	Tsã la, fia aɖe nɔ afima.
This is not an easy task.	Esia menye dɔ bɔbɔe o.
Now with the car.	Fifia kple ʋua.
He gave her the part he was working for.	Etsɔ akpa si wònɔ dɔ wɔm nɛ la nɛ.
Stay in the car.	Nɔ ʋua me.
This is really bad.	Esia nye nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Go back again and again.	Trɔ yi megbe zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
Add more flour.	Tsɔ wɔ geɖe de eme.
Listen if you can.	Se ne àte ŋui.
There was no one in the car.	Ame aɖeke menɔ ʋua me o.
I did a good job.	Mewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe.
I'm right there.	Mele afima tututu.
He probably has almost none.	Anɔ eme be ɖeke mele esi kloe o.
We’re not doing anything.	Míele naneke wɔm o.
For some reason, there was something odd about him.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, nane si mewɔ nuku o nɔ eŋu.
No one would step into that water.	Ame aɖeke maɖe afɔ ɖe tsi ma me o.
All that is needed is good planning in advance.	Nusi hiã koe nye ɖoɖo nyui wɔwɔ do ŋgɔ.
And also, that there is another.	Eye hã, be bubu aɖe li.
I just can’t get it out of my mind.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖee ɖa le nye susu me o.
And therefore there was great excitement.	Eye le esia ta dzidzɔ gã aɖe nɔ anyi.
However, this is no longer the case.	Ke hã, esia megale alea o.
He really tried.	Edze agbagba ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I’m not sure that would have been possible.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be ema anya wɔ hafi o.
I know what you’re going to say.	Menya nya si nàgblɔ.
That seems encouraging.	Edze abe nya ma de dzi ƒo na ame ene.
But I told him a lot.	Gake megblɔ nya geɖe nɛ.
He put his hand over his heart.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ɖo eƒe dzi dzi.
At this time now.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me fifia.
Not until he lost his dog.	Menye vaseɖe esime eƒe avu la bu o.
None of these circumstances exist in the present case.	Nɔnɔme siawo dometɔ aɖeke meli le nya si li fifia me o.
None of it seemed real.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke medze abe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ene o.
I should have mentioned that.	Ðe wòle be maƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu hafi.
I knew what he would do.	Menya nusi wòawɔ.
There was no mistake about it.	Vodada aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
Maybe someone has died.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe ku kpɔ.
His character was fine.	Eƒe nɔnɔme nɔ nyuie.
He could have been here.	Ate ŋu anɔ afisia hafi.
That would be really bad.	Ema anye nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This car is brand new.	Ʋu sia nye nu yeye aɖe ŋutɔ.
That’s the whole thing.	Emae nye nu bliboa katã.
It could be me this time.	Ate ŋu anye nye zi sia.
Here give me your hand.	Le afisia la, tsɔ wò asi nam.
Some things have changed here.	Nu aɖewo trɔ le afisia.
This last thing is very important to me.	Nu mamlɛtɔ sia le vevie nam ŋutɔ.
He was looking for what he was looking for.	Nu si dim wònɔ la dim wònɔ.
In fact, it doesn’t really exist at all.	Le nyateƒe me la, meli ŋutɔŋutɔ kura o.
I never realized this.	Nyemekpɔ esia dze sii kpɔ o.
But again, another opportunity presented itself.	Gake le afisia hã la, mɔnukpɔkpɔ bubu aɖe va do mo ɖa.
But of course he wouldn’t.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mawɔe nenema o.
Some of them didn’t know who he was.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo menya amesi wònye o.
We’re all going to miss that this summer.	Mí katã míele ema to ge le dzomeŋɔli sia me.
That is not true.	Ema menye nyateƒe o.
In fact, it’s the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo na ema.
I want to go there too.	Nye hã medi be mayi afima kpɔ.
I got there.	Meɖo afima.
But in this case, there’s really nothing we can do.	Gake le go sia me la, naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He doesn’t have much more.	Nu geɖe wu mele esi o.
But one thing remains clear.	Gake nu ɖeka gakpɔtɔ me kɔ.
This will continue for months.	Esia ayi edzi ɣleti geɖe.
Very few people showed up today.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe va egbea.
I'm the only one who knows you.	Nye ɖeka koe nya wò ɖa.
Take it on.	Xɔ edzi.
But the reason for this is obvious.	Gake susu si tae esia dzɔ ɖo la dze ƒã.
Few of them are like that.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe le nenema.
That is totally unnecessary.	Ema nye nusi mehiã kura o.
Perhaps this has gone too far.	Ðewohĩ esia yi ŋgɔ akpa.
He tried to see.	Edze agbagba be yeakpɔ nu.
His tongue spoke to her mouth.	Eƒe aɖe ƒo nu na eƒe nu.
The job is done.	Dɔa wu enu.
I didn’t touch it though.	Nyemeka asi eŋu ya o.
I have some of his books.	Eƒe agbalẽ aɖewo le asinye.
But this morning was a completely different story.	Gake ŋdi sia ya nye nya si to vovo kura.
I really enjoy the work.	Dɔa dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I can retire now.	Mate ŋu axɔ dzudzɔ le dɔme fifia.
That was very difficult for me.	Ema sesẽ nam ŋutɔ.
But there was no help with it.	Gake kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke menɔ anyi le eŋu o.
It seemed surreal to me.	Edze nam abe nusi me susu mele o ene.
It looked like they were making a call.	Edze abe ɖe wole ka ƒom ene.
And two dogs.	Kple avu eve.
Like myself.	Abe nye ŋutɔ ene.
Big mistake on my part.	Vodada gã aɖe le nye akpa dzi.
People you don’t know at all.	Ame siwo mènya kura o.
There is no issue here.	Nya aɖeke mele afisia o.
He never makes a mistake.	Mewɔa vodada gbeɖe o.
He hurried out of the room.	Ewɔ kaba do go le xɔa me.
My life seems like such a waste.	Edze abe nye agbe gbegblẽ alea ene.
It will do that.	Awɔe nenema.
Now it’s like he was never there.	Fifia ele abe ɖe menɔ afima kpɔ o ene.
This is simply not true.	Ðeko esia menye nyateƒe o.
However, this is quite the opposite.	Ke hã, esia to vovo kura na ema.
It is impossible at all.	Manya wɔ kura o.
The police raided the building.	Kpovitɔwo va dze xɔa me.
He couldn't find it now.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu fifia o.
He put his hand on his heart.	Etsɔ asi ɖo eƒe dzi dzi.
This is a wonderful opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ nyui aɖee nye esia.
There’s not much he can do about this.	Nu boo aɖeke meli wòate ŋu awɔ tso esia ŋu o.
Not on something like this.	Menye ɖe nane si le abe esia ene dzi o.
In just one respect.	Le go ɖeka ko me.
A difficult place.	Teƒe sesẽ aɖe.
It was just important that they were there.	Ðeko wònɔ vevie be wole afima.
The result came as a surprise to many.	Nusi do tso eme va wɔ nuku na ame geɖe.
It’s really interesting.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Police arrested two men last week.	Kpovitɔwo lé ŋutsu eve le kwasiɖa si va yi me.
I’m glad I found a spot.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mekpɔ teƒe aɖe.
One life for one death.	Agbe ɖeka ɖe ku ɖeka ta.
He had asked himself the same question.	Nya ma ke bia eɖokui hã kpɔ.
It is working well.	Ele dɔ wɔm nyuie.
The short and beyond.	Kpuie ko la kple edzi.
There were people in need.	Ame siwo hiã tu la nɔ anyi.
Some people are concerned about food with the diet in question.	Ame aɖewo tsi dzi ɖe nuɖuɖu ŋu kple nuɖuɖu ƒe ɖoɖo si ŋu nya ku ɖo.
Quite the same result.	Nusi do tso eme ma ke kura.
Modify the.	Trɔ asi le...
Not loudly.	Menye sesĩe o.
It was a great deal of fun.	Enye dzidzɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
The real one.	Amesi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Nothing is easy.	Naneke mele bɔbɔe o.
But no one listened to them.	Gake ame aɖeke meɖo to wo o.
Almost but not quite.	Kloe gake menye nenema tututu o.
It is the way of our people.	Enye míaƒe amewo ƒe mɔ.
Maybe something is missing.	Ðewohĩ nane bu le eme.
It was a surprise to us.	Ewɔ nuku na mí ŋutɔ.
One never knows .	Ame menya gbeɖe o .
Again, two things happened.	Le afisia hã la, nu eve dzɔ.
I'm still trying to figure this thing out.	Megale agbagba dzem kokoko be makpɔ nu sia gbɔ.
That didn’t exist before.	Ema menɔ anyi tsã o.
No one is going to listen to you.	Ame aɖeke mele to ɖo ge na wò o.
Men of the same character.	Ŋutsu siwo ƒe nɔnɔme le nenema ke.
You can stay with us tonight.	Àte ŋu anɔ mía gbɔ le zã sia me.
Perhaps not so surprising.	Ðewohĩ mewɔ nuku nenema gbegbe o.
He still has a big heart.	Dzi gã aɖe gakpɔtɔ le esi.
I just need one though.	Ðeko mehiã ɖeka gake.
I was	Ke ne .
This may take some time.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
Something has changed in him.	Nane trɔ le eme.
But he couldn't concentrate.	Gake mete ŋu tsɔ eƒe susu ɖo nu ŋu o.
He just can't talk to her.	Ðeko mete ŋu le eƒe nu ƒom nɛ o.
One person died.	Ame ɖeka ku.
It’s true though.	Enye nyateƒe gake.
I can speak out loud.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu sesĩe.
Like, everybody knows that.	Abe, amesiame nya ema ene.
That’s what he’s doing here.	Emae nye nusi wɔm wòle le afisia.
He should have done more.	Ðe wòle be wòawɔ nu geɖe hafi.
He impressed many of his teachers.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe eƒe nufiala geɖe dzi.
There is a lot of work ahead.	Dɔ geɖe le ŋgɔ gbɔna.
He had attacked some of them.	Edze wo dometɔ aɖewo dzi kpɔ.
That’s a lot of hard work.	Ema nye dɔ sesẽ geɖe ŋutɔ.
Hours and hours.	Gaƒoƒo kple gaƒoƒo geɖe.
He didn’t answer anything.	Meɖo nya aɖeke ŋu o.
Give voice, just once.	Na gbe, zi ɖeka ko.
He didn’t have time for this.	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ esi na esia o.
There was no mistake about it.	Vodada aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
But one person did take them in.	Gake ame ɖeka xɔ wo ɖe eme nyateƒe.
His comment was as surprising as it was unexpected.	Eƒe nya sia wɔ nuku abe alesi wònɔ le mɔ kpɔm na o ene.
I want four of them.	Medi be wo dometɔ ene.
Now that’s gone too.	Fifia ema hã nu yi.
Look at the loser.	Kpɔ amesi bu la ɖa.
But there is some good news.	Gake nya nyui aɖewo li.
It is much more than that.	Enye nu geɖe wu ema.
Let him do the job.	Na wòawɔ dɔa.
I just want to be alone, today.	Ðeko medi be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi, egbea.
There must have been at least one other person.	Ame bubu ɖeka ya teti anya nɔ afi ma.
I want more and more.	Medi geɖe wu.
Just focus on what you are doing.	Ðeko wò susu le nusi wɔm nèle ŋu.
I am glad I was able to come and help.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mete ŋu va kpe asi ɖe eŋu.
In a machine.	Le mɔ̃ aɖe me.
We have a place waiting for you.	Teƒe aɖe le mía si le lalam na wò.
Clearly, something is wrong.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ.
So there is no rule against it.	Eya ta se aɖeke meli si tsi tre ɖe eŋu o.
No big deal here.	Nya gã aɖeke mele afisia o.
He saw no one from his house.	Mekpɔ ame aɖeke tso eƒe aƒeme o.
Every last one of us.	Mía dometɔ mamlɛtɔ ɖesiaɖe.
And now I am, too.	Eye fifia nye hã.
Him!' 	Nɛ!'
I already knew who he was.	Menya amesi wònye xoxo.
I will take care of them all.	Makpɔ wo katã gbɔ.
I had to find another house.	Ele be madi aƒe bubu si me manɔ.
It was an old face.	Mo xoxo aɖee wònye.
She never tried to be with another man.	Medze agbagba be yeanɔ ŋutsu bubu aɖe gbɔ kpɔ o.
I would be the same.	Nye hã manɔ nenema.
Only a few people died.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe ku.
One of them is very good.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka nyo ŋutɔ.
You can’t get it out of your throat.	Màte ŋu aɖee le wò kɔ me o.
I told you what happened to me one night.	Megblɔ nusi dzɔ ɖe dzinye le zã aɖe me la na mi.
He was so clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ale gbegbe.
Some of them will appeal to you.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo adzɔ dzi na wò.
It never occurred to me.	Meva susu me nam kpɔ o.
The day before this.	Ŋkeke ɖeka do ŋgɔ na esia.
But this is quite different.	Gake esia to vovo kura.
So is he, too.	Eya hã le nenema.
I’m happy about that.	Edzɔ dzi nam ɖe ema ŋu.
A new person.	Ame yeye aɖe.
It’s a great idea.	Enye susu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can make a first impression once.	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi zi gbãtɔ zi ɖeka.
The car was in good condition.	Ʋua nɔ nɔnɔme nyui me.
Everything went against him.	Nusianu yi edzi tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
But that doesn’t work either.	Gake ema hã mewɔa dɔ o.
I hope your current job does the same.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wò dɔ si nèwɔ fifia hã awɔe nenema ke.
Obviously, we have our attention.	Edze ƒã be míaƒe susu le eŋu.
But it doesn’t work that way.	Gake mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
It was a long time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
That he is a new and better version of himself.	Be enye eya ŋutɔ ƒe nɔnɔme yeye si nyo wu.
But that wasn’t his way.	Gake menye emae nye eƒe mɔ o.
Trust me now.	Ka ɖe dzinye fifia.
Some of them may surprise you.	Ðewohĩ wo dometɔ aɖewo awɔ nuku na wò.
It’s just not there.	Ðeko mele afima o.
I was really surprised.	Mewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
One simple lie.	Alakpa bɔbɔe ɖeka.
I have witnessed this.	Mekpɔ esia teƒe.
But they all have the same characteristics.	Gake nɔnɔme ɖekae le wo katã si.
He won’t be home before another hour.	Mava aƒeme do ŋgɔ na gaƒoƒo bubu o.
Books on the horse.	Agbalẽ siwo ku ɖe sɔ ŋu.
You could see what was going on.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusi nɔ edzi yim.
It is still true.	Enye nyateƒe kokoko.
The meeting lasted all afternoon.	Kpekpea xɔ ŋdɔ bliboa katã.
I am still there.	Megale afima kokoko.
It felt like he could see right through me.	Ewɔ nam abe ɖe wòate ŋu akpɔ nu to menye tututu ene.
It’s very short in shape.	Eƒe nɔnɔme le kpuie ŋutɔ.
This should not have worked.	Mele be esia nawɔ dɔ hafi o.
I know that is true.	Menya be nya ma nye nyateƒe.
I couldn’t get up.	Nyemete ŋu fɔ o.
Something like that.	Nane si le abe ema ene.
A first for each of us.	Gbãtɔ na mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
This is a really big deal.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
One of every car looks like this.	Ʋu ɖesiaɖe ƒe ɖeka le abe esia ene.
It’s not going to be impossible.	Menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o ye ava o.
It may not be the case.	Ðewohĩ manɔ nenema o.
But there is no dog.	Gake avu aɖeke meli o.
Almost the same as reality.	Nusi sɔ kple nu ŋutɔŋutɔ kloe.
Attach a strong rope.	Kpe ka sesẽ aɖe.
I had two of them.	Wo dometɔ eve nɔ asinye.
It almost doesn’t seem to be there.	Edze abe mele afima o kloe ene.
But there seems to be something wrong with them.	Gake edze abe nane le wo ŋu ene.
All of these cases are slightly different.	Nya siawo katã to vovo vie.
If not this hour.	Ne menye gaƒoƒo sia o la.
Stay away from canned foods.	Te ɖa le nuɖuɖu siwo le go me ŋu.
No further action is required.	Mehiã be woawɔ nu bubu aɖeke le eŋu o.
Now more than ever.	Fifia wu tsã.
I remember it well.	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie.
It’s a timeless place.	Enye teƒe si ɣeyiɣi aɖeke mele o.
Maybe the air here was different in some way.	Ðewohĩ ya si nɔ afisia la to vovo le mɔ aɖe nu.
Something else, too.	Nu bubu aɖe hã.
I told you what we were going to do.	Megblɔ nu si míawɔ la na mi.
But it doesn’t work for everyone.	Gake mewɔa dɔ na amesiame o.
But there is nothing he can do.	Gake naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ o.
I made this house for you.	Mewɔ aƒe sia na wò.
I said this in my statement to the police.	Megblɔ nya sia le nye nya si megblɔ na kpovitɔwo me.
More difficult, but not impossible.	Sesẽ wu, gake menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o.
No one is going anywhere.	Ame aɖeke mele afi aɖeke yim o.
He could never tell her that.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nya ma nɛ gbeɖe o.
It just can’t happen.	Ðeko mate ŋu adzɔ o.
But, we can become more aware.	Gake, míate ŋu ava nya nu tso eŋu nyuie wu.
I don’t have to do it.	Mehiã be mawɔe o.
I will save my house.	Maɖe nye aƒe ɖe agbe.
I just discovered that.	Ðeko meke ɖe ema ŋu.
I don’t want to have one.	Nyemedi be ɖeka nanɔ asinye o.
He obviously was never expecting me.	Edze ƒã be menɔ mɔ kpɔm nam kpɔ o.
Explain it to him.	Ðe eme nɛ.
We know each other.	Míenya mía nɔewo.
People live a very hard life here.	Amewo nɔa agbe sesẽ ŋutɔ le afisia.
How many days did you have there?	Gbe nenie nɔ asiwò le afima?
I understand what they want.	Mese nusi dim wole la gɔme.
Thank you again.	Akpe na mi ake.
I just need to talk to someone.	Ðeko wòle be maƒo nu kple ame aɖe.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
I just didn’t know what to do.	Ðeko nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
Everyone had a job to do.	Amesiame ƒe dɔ nɔ esi wòawɔ.
This is what you are doing.	Esia wɔm nèle.
Maybe that would really help us all.	Ðewohĩ ema akpe ɖe mí katã ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But it is so.	Gake ele nenema.
The issue is simple.	Nya la le bɔbɔe.
In the course of the project.	Le dɔa wɔwɔ me.
I have to make a phone call.	Ele be maƒo ka.
This issue is deeper than that.	Nya sia de to wu ema.
He needs a job.	Ehiã dɔ.
This is not true at all.	Esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
My good guy didn’t say a word.	Nye ŋutsu nyui la megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
He seemed to be doing something.	Edze abe ɖe wòle nane wɔm ene.
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
In fact, you can do it now.	Le nyateƒe me la, àte ŋu awɔe fifia.
In fact, quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo kura na esia.
One doesn’t really need that.	Ame mehiã ema ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
In that, the same.	Le ema me la, nenema ke.
Too much time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe akpa va yi.
No one told me how to do it.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ alesi mawɔe nam o.
There was just nothing.	Ðeko naneke menɔ anyi o.
Maybe he will do that.	Ðewohĩ awɔe nenema.
For that matter, still not.	Le nya ma ta la, megale nenema kokoko o.
In fact, no one knows where the word came from.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame aɖeke menya afi si nya la dzɔ tso o.
I don’t want to know if he can do that.	Nyemedi be manya ne ate ŋu awɔ nu ma o.
He is like someone else.	Ele abe ame bubu aɖe ene.
You know you have a day.	Ènya be ŋkeke le ye si.
That would be fun for me.	Ema anye dzidzɔ nam.
I have to make another one.	Ele be mawɔ ɖeka bubu.
I can’t bear it.	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi o.
Life is just too short.	Ðeko agbe le kpuie akpa.
I don’t want to be here.	Nyemedi be manɔ afisia o.
That’s totally right.	Ema sɔ kura.
Which is neither here nor there.	Nusi mele afisia alo afima o.
That really changed things a lot for me.	Ema trɔ nuwo ŋutɔ nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I told myself it wouldn’t work.	Megblɔ na ɖokuinye be maɖe vi o.
Nothing would surprise me.	Naneke mawɔ nuku nam o.
He would say yes.	Agblɔ be ya.
It’s nothing else.	Menye nu bubu aɖeke o.
What is...	Nukae nye...
This is a good one.	Esia nyo.
Obviously, you will need to do more.	Edze ƒã be ahiã be nàwɔ geɖe wu.
How many of these things are there?	Nu siawo dometɔ nenie li?
Come here.	Va afisia.
He had a gun.	Tu nɔ esi.
Just a man.	Ŋutsu aɖe ko.
This must be done in advance.	Ele be woawɔ esia do ŋgɔ.
The project will be expensive.	Dɔa wɔwɔ axɔ ga geɖe.
He didn’t have a job yet and they still didn’t have money.	Dɔ aɖeke menɔ esi haɖe o eye ga hã menɔ wo si kokoko o.
I am doing really well.	Mele edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Many of them also do this for no good reason.	Wo dometɔ geɖe hã wɔa esia le susu nyui aɖeke ta o.
It's not right here.	Mele afisia nyuie o.
He doesn’t have to do anything else.	Mehiã be wòawɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
Which makes me so happy now.	Nusi na mekpɔ dzidzɔ ale gbegbe fifia.
There was water in the pool.	Tsi nɔ ta la me.
But that couldn’t have gone on for very long.	Gake ema mate ŋu ayi edzi ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ hafi o.
I needed a plan.	Mehiã ɖoɖo aɖe.
That’s why so many people lived.	Eya tae ame geɖe nɔ agbe ɖo.
He himself has done nothing wrong.	Eya ŋutɔ mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
In fact, there are still quite a few difficulties that exist.	Le nyateƒe me la, sesẽ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ gakpɔtɔ li siwo li.
This was very difficult for me.	Esia sesẽ nam ŋutɔ.
Society.	Du.
He can’t see that.	Mate ŋu akpɔ ema o.
But he won’t do it.	Gake mawɔe o.
Something was troubling there.	Nane nɔ fu ɖem na ame le afima.
It’s a pretty big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
The opposite actually happened.	Nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is a happy day.	Esia nye ŋkeke si me dzidzɔ le.
And now this.	Eye fifia esia.
Any alcohol will work.	Aha ɖesiaɖe awɔ dɔ.
It felt like there was no time.	Ewɔ nam abe ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli o ene.
Which is completely impossible.	Nusi mate ŋu adzɔ kura o.
He didn’t glance at me.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe ŋunye o.
Maybe things are fine now.	Ðewohĩ nuwo le nyuie fifia.
Way, way too long.	Mɔ, mɔ didi akpa.
Not a bad thing, in my mind.	Menye nu gbegblẽ aɖee wònye o, le nye susu me.
It will never be the same.	Manɔ abe tsã ene gbeɖe o.
I want him to fight.	Medi be wòawɔ avu.
I could go on and on.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim.
He couldn't get himself together.	Mete ŋu ƒo eɖokui ɖe enu o.
Still, he had such an active mind.	Ke hã, susu si le dɔ dzi alea nɔ esi.
Actually, so far it's not that weird.	Le nyateƒe me la, vaseɖe fifia la, menye nusi wɔ nuku nenema gbegbe o.
He never said a word to anyone.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke na ame aɖeke kpɔ o.
That’s very clear.	Ema me kɔ ŋutɔ.
I don’t think anyone can!.	Nyemesusu be ame aɖeke mate ŋui o!.
I don’t really know why though.	Nyemenya nusita tututu o gake.
The process took hours.	Dɔa wɔwɔ xɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe.
It’s amazing, and it’s amazing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, eye wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
It’s a whole new passion.	Enye didi yeye kura.
All in all, I liked her.	Le wo katã me la, eƒe nu lé dzi nam.
After that, check back here to share your thoughts.	Le ema megbe la, trɔ yi afisia be nàgblɔ wò susu.
And so far, no one can.	Eye vaseɖe fifia la, ame aɖeke mate ŋui o.
Who was there.	Ame si nɔ afima.
He would have been too busy to communicate.	Anye ne vovo manɔ eŋu akpa be wòate ŋu aɖo dze o.
That went on for so many years.	Ema yi edzi ƒe geɖe ale gbegbe.
Focus on what matters to you.	Lé fɔ ɖe nu siwo le vevie na wò la ŋu.
Come on, sit down.	Va, nɔ anyi.
There were no police, no one.	Kpovitɔwo menɔ anyi o, ame aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
If that’s what you’re looking for.	Ne emae nye nusi dim nèle.
It wasn’t settled.	Menye ɖe wònɔ anyi ɖo o.
I’m the one with the easy job.	Nyee nye amesi si dɔ bɔbɔe la le.
I had fun with him last night.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ kplii le zã si va yi me.
Give us that opportunity.	Na mɔnukpɔkpɔ ma mí.
There may be many pitfalls at work here.	Ðewohĩ mɔ̃ geɖe le dɔ wɔm le afisia.
Look at the man there.	Kpɔ ŋutsu si le afima ɖa.
Something happened, something new.	Nane dzɔ, nu yeye aɖe dzɔ.
And for another reason.	Eye le susu bubu aɖe hã ta.
He never needed another name.	Mehiã ŋkɔ bubu aɖeke gbeɖe o.
And you have to do this the first time.	Eye ele be nàwɔ esia zi gbãtɔ.
It was a waste of time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
I thought everything was one step in one way or another.	Mesusu be nusianu ɖe ​​afɔ ɖeka le mɔ aɖe nu.
It was the last part that never really worked.	Enye akpa mamlɛtɔ si mewɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
None of them are true.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
And in money, too.	Eye le ga me hã.
We can work with any situation.	Míate ŋu awɔ dɔ kple nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe.
One of many people.	Ame geɖe dometɔ ɖeka.
We cannot say whether it is true or false.	Míate ŋu agblɔ nenye be enye nyateƒe alo alakpa o.
He did not allow them to join him.	Meɖe mɔ be woawɔ ɖeka kplii o.
Not a problem at all.	Menye kuxi aɖeke kura o.
I was going to beat myself up.	Menɔ ɖokuinye ƒo ge.
Nothing was too much trouble.	Naneke meɖe fu na wo akpa o.
He will need that much help.	Ahiã kpekpeɖeŋu nenema gbegbe.
There was anger.	Dziku nɔ anyi.
I will take care of them.	Makpɔ wo dzi.
Go to my car.	Yi nye ʋua gbɔ.
In some cases, it’s pretty clear.	Le go aɖewo me la, eme kɔ nyuie.
This house is in a great location.	Aƒe sia le teƒe nyui aɖe.
You can be better for me.	Àte ŋu anyo nam wu.
This is not a good thing.	Esia menye nu nyui aɖeke o.
It is a difficult task.	Enye dɔ sesẽ aɖe.
It should be able to seat more people.	Ele be wòate ŋu ana ame geɖe nanɔ anyi.
I used to do that myself.	Tsã la, nye ŋutɔ hã mewɔe nenema.
That first time, and so many times after that.	Zi gbãtɔ ma, kple zi geɖe ŋutɔ le ema megbe.
This statement will always be false.	Nya sia anye alakpa ɣesiaɣi.
If only it were that simple.	Ne ɖe wòle bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe hafi.
I hope this helps someone.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia akpe ɖe ame aɖe ŋu.
There is only food for one person.	Nuɖuɖu koe li na ame ɖeka.
Or for life, it seems.	Alo ɖe agbe ta la, edze abe.
I do this seriously.	Mewɔa esia vevie.
It could have been the other way around.	Ate ŋu anye mɔ bubu aɖe hafi.
It will make today so much easier.	Ana egbea nanɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
His mind is also clear.	Eƒe susu hã me kɔ.
I don’t know much about it yet.	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu haɖe o.
I just can’t see this.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia o.
There had been a car.	Ʋu aɖe dzɔ kpɔ.
And they may have to fight.	Eye ɖewohĩ ahiã be woawɔ avu.
He can’t say when.	Mate ŋu agblɔ ɣekaɣie o.
I gave up several times.	Meɖe asi le eŋu zi geɖe.
That was a great job.	Dɔ gã aɖee nye ema.
I did earlier today.	Mewɔe do ŋgɔ egbea.
Some of them are private.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
He had never felt this way before.	Mese le eɖokui me alea kpɔ o.
So much so that it was amazing.	Ale gbegbe be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Police interviewed everyone present.	Kpovitɔwo bia gbe amesiame si nɔ afima.
This is very surprising to me.	Esia wɔa nuku nam ŋutɔ.
At this point, someone needs to be present.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, ehiã be ame aɖe nanɔ eteƒe.
Like, the last way.	Abe, mɔ mamlɛtɔ ene.
Go ahead and hurry.	Yi ŋgɔ eye nàwɔ kaba.
He narrowly escaped death.	Esi le ku nu kpuie.
That is not true at all.	Nya ma menye nyateƒe kura o.
And thank you for it! 	Eye akpe na wò!
And something is better than nothing.	Eye nane nyo wu naneke o.
I believe in strategy.	Mexɔ aɖaŋu dzi se.
Use just a few words!	Zã nya ʋɛ aɖewo ko!
Still, he had a good word for her.	Ke hã, nya nyui aɖe nɔ esi nɛ.
Follow the mandatory rule.	Wɔ se si wòle be woawɔ la dzi.
The desire to make money.	Didi be yeakpɔ ga.
There is nothing we can do that he cannot do without us.	Naneke meli si míate ŋu awɔ si mate ŋu awɔ mía manɔmee o.
How very surprised he was.	Aleke gbegbe wòwɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
Everything has a form.	Nusianu ƒe nɔnɔme aɖe li.
I didn’t expect it in a car.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ nɛ le ʋu me o.
I will ride with him.	Mado sɔ kplii.
This is not a big deal.	Esia menye nya gã aɖeke o.
He gave her respect.	Etsɔ bubu nɛ.
He couldn’t stand it.	Mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
That’s everyone.	Emae nye amesiame.
I know everything, remember.	Menya nusianu, ɖo ŋku edzi.
This is too small.	Esia le sue akpa.
I am something else.	Nyee nye nu bubu aɖe.
I don’t know if that’s surprising.	Nyemenya nenye be esia wɔ nuku o.
Some of them killed more than one person.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo wu ame siwo wu ɖeka.
They are going hard on each other.	Wole wo nɔewo dzi yim sesĩe.
And he is looking for us.	Eye wòle mía dim.
Some thought someone else would.	Ame aɖewo susui be ame bubu aɖee awɔe.
It won’t stay that way for long.	Manɔ nenema ɣeyiɣi didi o.
It happened by itself.	Edzɔ le eɖokui si.
It’s personal.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
He didn’t apologize for anything.	Meɖe kuku le naneke ta o.
Stay in the car.	Nɔ ʋua me.
Today, all is calm.	Egbea la, nuwo katã ƒe dzi dze eme.
It will help us.	Akpe ɖe mía ŋu.
This is very difficult to do.	Esia wɔwɔ sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Tell him he is a wonderful person.	Gblɔ nɛ be enye ame nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Not ever, not in any case.	Menye gbeɖe o, menye le go aɖeke me o.
This is a good news.	Nya nyui aɖee nye esia.
And in this time and place, that’s no small feat.	Eye le ɣeyiɣi sia kple teƒe sia me la, ema menye nu sue aɖeke o.
I'll give up a bit here.	Maɖe asi le eŋu vie le afisia.
Some people just stood up.	Ðeko ame aɖewo tsi tre.
It doesn’t need much water.	Mehiã tsi geɖe o.
There is no opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke meli o.
It was a difficult time for him.	Enye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe nɛ.
That wasn’t on us.	Ema menɔ mía dzi o.
Forget the wind.	Ŋlɔ ya la be.
Tell us what you think.	Gblɔ nusi nèsusu na mí.
He would be very pleased.	Adzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
We are seeing this again.	Míele esia kpɔm ake.
We’re all trying to work for the same job.	Mí katã míele agbagba dzem be míawɔ dɔ ɖe dɔ ɖeka ta.
The man who shot me.	Ŋutsu si da tu nye la.
I couldn’t relax at home.	Nyemete ŋu ɖi ɖe eme le aƒeme o.
He never joined them.	Mewɔ ɖeka kpli wo kpɔ o.
There has to be a lot in it.	Ele be nu geɖe nanɔ eme.
You might say that’s not a big deal.	Àte ŋu agblɔ be ema menye nu gã aɖeke o.
I am smart as a man.	Medze aɖaŋu abe ŋutsu ene.
People stayed behind.	Amewo tsi anyi.
He will do anything for you.	Awɔ nusianu na wò.
But there is clearly one person in charge.	Gake edze ƒã be ame ɖekae le dɔa dzi kpɔm.
So do you, too.	Nenema ke wò hã.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anye nenema o.
I can’t say when.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ ɣekaɣie o.
No one came near him.	Ame aɖeke mete ɖe eŋu o.
It’s kind of weird.	Enye nu ƒomevi aɖe si mewɔ nuku o.
That came on that night.	Ema va le zã ma me.
That tells us two things.	Ema gblɔ nu eve na mí.
I dressed differently.	Medo awu le mɔ bubu nu.
It’s very realistic.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.	Nyemenya nusi le fu ɖem nam o.
I want to sit with you.	Medi be manɔ anyi kpli wò.
He was just running as fast as he could.	Ðeko wònɔ du dzi alesi wòate ŋui.
I did it in the basement.	Mewɔe le xɔa te.
I’m the little one.	Nyee nye sue.
And that’s easy money.	Eye ema nye ga si le bɔbɔe.
I'll just speak for myself here though.	Nye ŋutɔ maƒo nu na ɖokuinye ko le afisia ke hã.
Thank you very, very much.	Akpe na mi ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
But it’s not what you think it is.	Gake menye nusi nèsusu be ele o.
He had only one leg.	Afɔ ɖeka koe nɔ esi.
I believed them to some extent.	Mexɔ wo dzi se vaseɖe afi aɖe.
You don’t want him to be alone.	Mèdi be eya ɖeka nanɔ anyi o.
As a result, many people died.	Esia wɔe be ame geɖe ku.
Lost.	Bu.
He felt no joy in it.	Mese le eɖokui me be dzidzɔ aɖeke mele eme o.
We had some work to do with this guy.	Dɔ aɖewo nɔ mía si míawɔ kple ŋutsu sia.
A man, two dogs.	Ŋutsu aɖe, avu eve.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It’s not a big building.	Menye xɔ gã aɖee wònye o.
I was in the clear.	Menɔ nusi me kɔ la me.
I didn’t feel it.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me o.
And he was running, too.	Eye eya hã nɔ du dzi.
It won’t bother him.	Maɖe fu nɛ o.
Everyone knows this is impossible.	Amesiame nya be esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Mine is double.	Nye tɔ nye zi gbɔ zi eve.
Add too much salt.	De dze geɖe eme akpa.
I needed to do that.	Ehiã be mawɔe nenema.
This is a small market.	Esia nye asi sue aɖe.
I can’t do anything.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
Exactly what it is.	Nusi tututu wònye.
It all started with one man’s work.	Nusianu dze egɔme tso ŋutsu ɖeka ƒe dɔ dzi.
His face twisted in anger.	Eƒe mo trɔ le dziku ta.
It’s not just a car.	Menye ʋu koe wònye o.
He hadn't expected that before.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na ema tsã o.
Or what it looked like.	Alo nusi dze abe ɖe wòle ene.
You are one of my people.	Nye amewo dometɔ ɖeka nènye.
Things were going on.	Nuwo nɔ edzi yim.
That’s his job.	Emae nye eƒe dɔ.
There is so much traffic.	Ʋu geɖe ŋutɔ le afima.
People are still in it.	Amewo gakpɔtɔ le eme.
It’s too weird.	Ewɔ nuku akpa.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Gake naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu o.
He was the only one.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
I made a lot of mistakes.	Mewɔ vodada geɖe.
I haven’t heard anything about this.	Nyemese naneke tso nya sia ŋu o.
Not that long ago.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia o.
This time it was somewhere else.	Fifia ya, teƒe bubu aɖee wònɔ.
I couldn’t do that at all.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ ema kura o.
We still had a lot of work to do.	Dɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ mía si míawɔ.
This has now changed.	Esia trɔ fifia.
A first point.	Nya gbãtɔ aɖe.
I started out so well.	Medze egɔme nyuie ale gbegbe.

None of us would do that.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mawɔe nenema o.
We had absolutely no food or water.	Nuɖuɖu alo tsi aɖeke kura menɔ mía si o.
Now or never.	Fifia alo gbeɖe o.
There is one possibility.	Nu ɖeka aɖe li si ate ŋu adzɔ.
However, there are more important issues.	Ke hã nya aɖewo li siwo le vevie wu.
Fire in the house.	Dzo le aƒea me.
We can help each other but very little.	Míate ŋu akpe ɖe mía nɔewo ŋu gake nu sue aɖe koe míate ŋu akpe ɖe mía nɔewo ŋu.
I want to join you.	Medi be mawɔ ɖeka kpli wò.
He wanted nothing more to do with her.	Medi be yeawɔ naneke kplii wu ema o.
There have been so many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi kpɔ.
Two points are in order here.	Nya eve aɖewo le ɖoɖo nu le afisia.
I would be happy to do so.	Adzɔ dzi nam be mawɔe alea.
Just do it.	Wɔe ko.
It doesn’t need any additional work to work.	Mehiã dɔ bubu aɖeke hafi wòate ŋu awɔ dɔ o.
I already have enough money.	Ga si sɔ gbɔ le asinye xoxo.
Everything went very well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie ŋutɔ.
This is a no-brainer.	Esia nye nusi me susu mele o.
That part works well.	Akpa ma wɔa dɔ nyuie.
But there were also people who saved you.	Gake ame aɖewo hã nɔ anyi siwo xɔ na wò.
There is no one there.	Ame aɖeke mele afima o.
I finally got two.	Meva kpɔ eve mlɔeba.
To all the people out there who have tried.	Na ame siwo katã le afima siwo te kpɔ.
Many people are worried.	Ame geɖe tsi dzi.
It is in the making.	Ele wɔwɔ me.
None of them are easy to think about.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu bubu mele bɔbɔe o.
There is no gun to impress.	Tu aɖeke meli be wòawɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi o.
I stayed there for a while.	Menɔ afima ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
And yet, part of me can’t help but do just that.	Eye ke hã, nye akpa aɖe mate ŋu awɔ naneke wu be mawɔ nu ma tututu o.
This made everyone happy.	Esia na amewo katã kpɔ dzidzɔ.
You just can’t see them.	Ðeko màte ŋu akpɔ wo o.
Tell me what you think.	Gblɔ nusi nèsusu nam.
But yet here we are.	Gake ke hã míele afisia.
The issue is still very important.	Nya la gakpɔtɔ le vevie ŋutɔ.
You have to have a car.	Ele be ʋu nanɔ ame si.
There could be no better time than now.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi si nyo wu fifia o.
Or similar words.	Alo nya siwo sɔ kple esia.
Ask for help.	Bia kpekpeɖeŋu.
I got a new one this year.	Mexɔ yeye le ƒe sia me.
His hand fell at her feet.	Eƒe asi ge dze anyi le eƒe afɔ gbɔ.
He is going to live.	Ele agbe nɔ ge.
It is very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ.
Or any other job.	Alo dɔ bubu ɖesiaɖe hã.
But it doesn’t matter.	Gake mehiã o.
That was there.	Ema nɔ anyi.
He didn’t know anyone there.	Menya ame aɖeke le afima o.
I have been able to make it work so far.	Mete ŋu na wòwɔ dɔ vaseɖe fifia.

Part of me would like to be able to talk.	Nye akpa aɖe adi be yeate ŋu aƒo nu.
He just can't help it.	Ðeko mate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu o.
And there was something.	Eye nane nɔ anyi.
I am by no means alone in realizing this.	Menye nye ɖeka koe kpɔ esia dze sii kura o.
But that is impressive.	Gake ema wɔa dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
There is food and water.	Nuɖuɖu kple tsi le afima.
He didn’t do that, of course.	Mewɔe nenema ya o.
If this happens.	Ne esia dzɔ.
They have to work.	Ele be woawɔ dɔ.

Still, it’s not intellectually bad.	Ke hã, menye nu gbegblẽ le susu me o.

There is no blood on it.	Ʋu aɖeke mele edzi o.
It seems to be working now.	Edze abe ele dɔ wɔm fifia ene.
It couldn’t have come out any better.	Mate ŋu ado tso eme nyuie wu ema o.
A week has passed.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka va yi.
But in reality, everyone knew he wasn’t going to live.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, amesiame nya be mele agbe nɔ ge o.
Feed the dog.	Na nuɖuɖu avu la.
I was just surprised.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku nam.
I have to tell you something.	Ele be magblɔ nya aɖe na wò.
I don’t know when.	Nyemenya ɣekaɣie o.
All these nice houses.	Aƒe nyui siawo katã.
I think it’s there.	Mesusu be ele afima.
We have so much in common.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le mía si siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
I can’t find a gun.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ tu o.
It worked out well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
It may be that way.	Ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
However not too personal.	Ke hã menye ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa o.
Or in the case.	Alo le nya la me.
Always stand up.	Tsi tre ɣesiaɣi.
But he didn’t know where he was.	Gake menya afi si wòle o.
But this would be a mistake.	Gake esia anye vodada.
It happened in his own home.	Edzɔ le eya ŋutɔ ƒe aƒe me.
And I know a lot about it.	Eye menya nu geɖe tso eŋu.
I think that’s a little high.	Mesusu be ema kɔ vie.
But he wasn’t there.	Gake menɔ afima o.
We can talk more tomorrow.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu geɖe wu etsɔ.
It’s the same for everyone, really.	Nenema ke wòle na amesiame, le nyateƒe me.
He doesn't know how he got there.	Menya ale si wòwɔ va ɖo afi ma o.
That’s something that’s important to me.	Ema nye nusi le vevie nam.
And after that, that was it for me.	Eye le ema megbe la, emae nye ema nam.
I told him many things that only he would know to be true.	Megblɔ nya geɖe nɛ si eya ɖeka koe anya be enye nyateƒe.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Menye nu bɔbɔe aɖe si woawɔ o.
Beware of a man.	Kpɔ nyuie le ŋutsu aɖe ŋu.
I understand that.	Mese nya ma gɔme.
He was very clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ.
But he had someone else.	Gake ame bubu aɖe hã nɔ esi.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I felt, for the first time, a man like everyone else.	Mese le ɖokuinye me, zi gbãtɔ, ŋutsu abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
I came here myself.	Nye ŋutɔ meva afisia.
Maybe I can continue.	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu ayi edzi.
I hope this is a simple and obvious mistake.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia nye vodada bɔbɔe aɖe si dze ƒã.
I don’t know how many days it was.	Nyemenya ŋkeke nenie wònye o.
He didn’t ask any questions at that point.	Mebia nya aɖeke le ɣeyiɣi ma me o.
However, that will happen.	Ke hã, ema ava eme.
He was a very great man.	Enye ame gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
And everything that happened in it.	Eye nusianu si dzɔ le eme.
I can’t say that.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma o.
But this time it was a minor thing.	Gake fifia ya, nu sue aɖe koe wònye.
Shortly after that.	Ema megbe kpuie.
I didn’t see anything else.	Nyemekpɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
That would be a great thing.	Ema anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
This is the opposite of the truth.	Esia to vovo na nyateƒea.
Things are starting to start for me.	Nuwo le egɔme dzem nam.
Hold my hand.	Lé nye asi.
I said it was impossible.	Megblɔ be manya wɔ o.
It’s just more like that.	Ðeko wòle nenema wu.
I knew it would come.	Menya be ava.
That was some time ago.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye sia.
I believed in myself.	Mexɔ ɖokuinye dzi se.
Make it boring.	Na wòate ɖeɖi ame ŋu.
Do more of them next year.	Wɔ wo dometɔ geɖe wu le ƒe si gbɔna me.
We’ll work on something.	Míawɔ dɔ tso nane ŋu.
I couldn’t find it.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
No one will do our work for us.	Ame aɖeke mawɔ míaƒe dɔ na mí o.
You can’t see them.	Màte ŋu akpɔ wo o.
You can travel throughout the night.	Àte ŋu azɔ mɔ le zã bliboa me.
Is this price enough for the room?	Ðe asi sia sɔ gbɔ na xɔa?
He could have called me.	Anye ne ate ŋu aƒo ka nam hafi.
This didn’t come easily to him.	Nu sia meva nɛ bɔbɔe o.
There is no one to fight.	Ame aɖeke meli woawɔ avu o.
You can’t stay here.	Màte ŋu anɔ afisia o.
I really enjoyed that.	Ema dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Or here it is.	Alo le afisia.
Neither does anyone now.	Ame aɖeke hã mewɔe nenema fifia o.
That would be a loss.	Ema anye nusi bu.
Now this is easy.	Fifia esia le bɔbɔe.
It can cause.	Ate ŋu ana be...
The night is coming when no one can work.	Zã gbɔna, esime ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ dɔ o.
That was exciting.	Ema do dzidzɔ na ame.
This makes it impossible for you to walk.	Esia na be màte ŋu azɔ o.
I just got out of everything.	Ðeko medo le nusianu me.
For a man.	Na ŋutsu aɖe.
We certainly are.	Míele nenema godoo.
In fact, it’s amazing.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I was in it because of him.	Menɔ eme le eya ta.
Perhaps he has made a mistake.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ vodada kpɔ.
I tried every one of them.	Mete wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe kpɔ.
He really got along with it.	Ewɔ ɖeka kplii ŋutɔŋutɔ.
At any price.	Le asi ɖesiaɖe nu.
And it’s a difficult character.	Eye eƒe nɔnɔme sesẽ.
People who are like you.	Ame siwo le abe wò ene.
That’s too much.	Ema sɔ gbɔ akpa.
Now he is marrying someone else.	Fifia ele ame bubu aɖe ɖem.
But he couldn’t find any.	Gake mete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeke ŋu o.
But use them in moderation.	Gake zã wo le mɔ si sɔ nu.
She volunteered for many years as a retired teacher.	Etsɔ eɖokui na ƒe geɖe be enye nufiala si xɔ dzudzɔ le dɔme.
It was a lot of death.	Enye ku geɖe ŋutɔ.
I’m the little one.	Nyee nye sue.
That is a problem, of course.	Ema nye kuxi aɖe ya.
You can imagine his surprise.	Àte ŋu akpɔ ale si gbegbe wòwɔ nuku nɛ la le susu me.
I don’t understand it though.	Nyemese egɔme o gake.
But it will take hard work.	Gake ahiã dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ.
I don’t know what else to say.	Nyemenya nya bubu si magblɔ o.
There is no hard time.	Ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖeke meli o.
This is a waste of my time.	Esia nye nye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
I am not sure how to do this.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi mawɔ esia dzi o.
Its so good enough.	Eƒe nyui ale gbegbe.
But this time, it won’t be so easy.	Gake fifia ya, manɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
But here it is very important.	Gake le afisia la, ele vevie ŋutɔ.
At any moment he may be on them.	Le ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe me la, ate ŋu anɔ wo dzi.
Or we can stay in it.	Alo míate ŋu anɔ eme.
I have worked for this moment for a long time.	Mewɔ dɔ na ɣeyiɣi sia ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
Free to work here.	Vovo le dɔ wɔm le afisia.
Du kaba!	Du kaba!
There is nothing like that.	Naneke mele nenema o.
It wasn’t a car.	Menye ʋu ye o.
We have a day of hard work ahead of us.	Dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ ƒe ŋkeke aɖe le mía ŋgɔ.
He didn’t see anything wrong.	Mekpɔ naneke si gblẽ o.
I think it’s a great idea.	Mesusu be enye susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Your life is our business.	Wò agbe nye míaƒe nya.
Suddenly, a gunshot.	Zi ɖeka la, tu aɖe ɖi.
Come on now, say it is what it is.	Va azɔ, gblɔ be enye nusi wònye.
This is beautiful.	Esia nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
But that’s pretty much it, you know.	Gake ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ, ènya.
This is neither good nor bad.	Esia menye nu nyui alo nu gbegblẽ o.
Many people have written to me about this problem.	Ame geɖe ŋlɔ agbalẽ nam tso kuxi sia ŋu.
My name is on the cover of a book.	Nye ŋkɔ le agbalẽ aɖe ƒe akpa dzi.
This will happen.	Esia adzɔ.
Tom is working hard.	Tom le dɔ wɔm sesĩe.
But he had also lost his life before.	Gake eƒe agbe hã bu do ŋgɔ.
Something was going on.	Nane nɔ edzi yim.
It can still be that way.	Ate ŋu anɔ nenema kokoko.
That person is satisfied.	Ame ma ƒe dzi dze eme.
He couldn’t stay here long.	Mete ŋu nɔ afisia eteƒe didi o.
Which it usually is.	Nusi wònye zi geɖe.
He had to work in the morning.	Ele nɛ be wòawɔ dɔ le ŋdi me.
I have four children.	Vi ene le asinye.
It’s too much for one person.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ akpa na ame ɖeka.
These conditions are very different.	Nɔnɔme siawo to vovo kura.
I hoped it wouldn’t bother them.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be maɖe fu na wo o.
He is desperately trying to find a new job.	Ele agbagba dzem vevie be yeakpɔ dɔ yeye aɖe.
That’s pretty much what he did.	Nusi wòwɔ kloe ye nye ema.
This obviously doesn’t work.	Edze ƒã be esia mewɔa dɔ o.
It’s not a difficult thing.	Menye nu sesẽ o.
He was very interested in it.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme vevie.
There's more there.	Afima geɖe wu le eme.
That sounds interesting.	Ema ɖi nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame.
I don’t want anyone else.	Nyemedi ame bubu aɖeke o.
None of us would do that.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mawɔe nenema o.
Say more with less.	Gblɔ nya geɖe kple nu sue aɖe ko.
It was a great city.	Du gã aɖee wònye.
That’s all it is.	Esia koe wònye.
I wasn’t sure it would help.	Meka ɖe edzi be aɖe vi aɖeke o.
I just don’t know what to do with them.	Ðeko nyemenya nusi mawɔ kpli wo o.
That just calmed my anger.	Ðeko ema na nye dziku nu va yi.
Go on please, do go on.	Yi edzi taflatse, do yi edzi.
Maybe there was something to that.	Ðewohĩ nane nɔ ema ŋu.
Otherwise, there was a problem.	Ne menye nenema o la, kuxi aɖe nɔ anyi.
He couldn’t outrun them.	Mete ŋu ƒu du wu wo o.
His voice rose.	Eƒe gbe kɔ ɖe dzi.
But it’s not true.	Gake menye nyateƒe o.
It could be months.	Ate ŋu anye ɣleti geɖe.
I am a very person.	Menye ame ŋutɔ.
He began to speak.	Edze egɔme nɔ nu ƒom.
And that’s important.	Eye esia le vevie.
Go back, and someone else will take over.	Trɔ yi megbe, eye ame bubu aɖe axɔ dɔa.
He didn’t say anything about it, to me.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke tso eŋu o, nam.
Actually, I am not.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemele nenema o.
I did more than that.	Mewɔ nu geɖe wu ema ko.
But the face	Gake mo la .
There’s still room inside for my head.	Teƒe aɖe gakpɔtɔ le eme na nye ta.
My project didn’t materialize.	Nye dɔa meva eme o.
No one has ever given me as much as you have.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ nu geɖe nam abe wò ene kpɔ o.
Nice to see you.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mekpɔ wò.
I'll let him go.	Maɖe asi le eŋu.
That’s why we’re here tonight.	Esia tae míele afisia le zã sia me ɖo.
It will get there.	Aɖo afima.
Apparently it had been unoccupied for years.	Edze abe ame aɖeke menɔ eme ƒe geɖe o ene.
Be very careful.	Kpɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
I want to do it.	Medi be mawɔe.
I was at home.	Menɔ aƒeme.
The money is very tight.	Ga la sesẽ ŋutɔ.
That is very important to me.	Ema le vevie nam ŋutɔ.
But the project doesn’t seem to be working so much right now.	Gake edze abe dɔa mele dɔ wɔm nenema gbegbe fifia o ene.
That’s your job.	Emae nye wò dɔ.
But they now have a serious problem.	Gake kuxi sesẽ aɖe le wo ŋu fifia.
He couldn’t open his eyes.	Mete ŋu ʋu ŋku o.
He needs water.	Ehiã tsi.
I'll get you some money.	Makpɔ ga aɖe na wò.
Could interest you and me maybe.	Ate ŋu adzɔ dzi na nye kple wò hã ɖewohĩ.
I think this can only be a small thing.	Mesusu be nu sue aɖe koe esia ate ŋu anye.
Great job and good price.	Dɔ gã aɖe kple asi nyui aɖe.
But he doesn’t know everything.	Gake menya nu sia nu o.
I miss you so much.	Mesusu wò ŋutɔ.
But this situation is different.	Gake nɔnɔme sia to vovo.
Now two people head for the car.	Fifia ame eve ɖo ta ʋua me.
We are in it together.	Míele eme ɖekae.
That just wouldn’t work.	Ðeko ema mawɔ dɔ o.
I just did something wrong.	Ðeko mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
Just like you would at home.	Abe alesi nàwɔ le aƒeme ene.
I have something.	Mewɔ nane.
And your mind is on you.	Eye wò susu le ŋuwò.
Less than a year old.	Mexɔ ƒe ɖeka tututu o.
Only this week!.	Kwasiɖa sia me koe!.
But it was clear enough.	Gake eme kɔ ale gbegbe.
I don’t want to know.	Nyemedi be manya o.
That’s really it.	Ema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is not like you.	Esia mele abe wò ene o.
Some others are not.	Ame bubu aɖewo ya mele nenema o.
This is already happening, of course.	Esia le edzi yim xoxo ya.
It will allow you to join us.	Aɖe mɔ na wò be nàwɔ ɖeka kpli mí.
In many cases, it could be a mistake.	Le go geɖe me la, ate ŋu anye vodada.
So far everything is working fine.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie.
Maybe there is nothing here.	Ðewohĩ naneke mele afisia o.
I want no part of this.	Nyemedi esia ƒe akpa aɖeke o.
He could not concentrate on the task.	Mete ŋu tsɔ eƒe susu ɖo dɔa ŋu o.
None of it is true at all, mind.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe kura o, susu.
I searched for hours, but nothing worked.	Medi gaƒoƒo geɖe, gake naneke mewɔ dɔ o.
Now look at what you did.	Azɔ kpɔ nu si nèwɔ la ɖa.
There is no right or wrong way.	Mɔ nyui alo mɔ gbegblẽ aɖeke meli o.
That can do it.	Ema ate ŋu awɔe.
He sang along with her.	Edzi ha kpe ɖe eŋu.
Now you know more than this new thing.	Fifia ènya nu geɖe wu nu yeye sia.
But it didn’t bother him.	Gake meɖe fu nɛ o.
Just a little bit.	Sue aɖe ko.
It was as if they had no money at all.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe ga mele wo si kura o ene.
I met him here.	Medo go le afisia.
I always do them.	Mewɔa wo ɣesiaɣi.
But there was something.	Gake nane nɔ anyi.
I’m by no means the only one with this.	Nye ɖeka koe esia dzɔ ɖe edzi kura o.
Life is too short.	Agbe le kpuie akpa.
You are not a good person.	Menye ame nyui aɖee nènye o.
The clothes are dirty.	Awu la ƒo ɖi.
A wish will be fulfilled.	Woawɔ didi aɖe dzi.
There is no clothing.	Awu aɖeke meli o.
I confirmed it was real.	Meɖo kpe edzi be enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He fought hard.	Ewɔ avu sesĩe.
There is much today about this.	Nu geɖe li egbea le esia ŋu.
That’s not why you’re here.	Menye esia tae nèle afisia ɖo o.
These words apply to you today.	Nya siawo ku ɖe ŋuwò egbea.
You can’t live with them.	Màte ŋu anɔ agbe kpli wo o.
This name contradicts it.	Ŋkɔ sia tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
But he didn’t do anything like that.	Gake mewɔ naneke nenema o.
Thank you for yours.	Akpe na wò ɖe.
He will always be with us.	Anɔ mía gbɔ ɣesiaɣi.
That’s why it’s there.	Ema tae wòle.
I remember them all now.	Meɖo ŋku wo katã dzi fifia.
And so we are new.	Eye ale míenye ame yeye.
We just have to be.	Ðeko wòle be míele.
He would need to hurry.	Ahiã be wòawɔ kaba.
I am trying to do it.	Mele agbagba dzem be mawɔe.
Only a small proportion of the population is literate.	Amewo ƒe akpa sue aɖe koe nya agbalẽ.
He put in the work.	Etsɔ dɔa de eme.
Go back to work.	Trɔ yi dɔme.
I just couldn’t do it.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu wɔe o.
Many were discouraged.	Dzi ɖe le ame geɖe ƒo.
It happened.	Edzɔ.
I was so busy at work today.	Vovo menɔ ŋunye le dɔme ale gbegbe egbea.
But it doesn’t matter.	Gake mehiã o.
I couldn’t keep them.	Nyemete ŋu lé wo ɖe te o.
He was very clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ.
And some sweat.	Kple fifia aɖewo.
No one is asking for that.	Ame aɖeke mele ema biam o.
And it’s too short for you.	Eye wòle kpuie akpa na wò.
This idea never crossed my mind.	Susu sia meva susu me nam kpɔ o.
The meeting failed.	Kpekpea medze edzi o.
Keep it well drained.	Na tsi nanɔ eme nyuie.
A good person might have done the same.	Ðewohĩ ame nyui aɖe hã wɔ nenema ke hafi.
We can still find each other.	Míate ŋu ake ɖe mía nɔewo ŋu kokoko.
He has an eye for that sort of thing.	Ŋku le esi ɖe nu ma ƒomevi ŋu.
He will see that soon enough.	Akpɔ ema kaba ale gbegbe.
This isn’t bad or bad.	Esia menye nu gbegblẽ alo nu gbegblẽ o.
And he was surprised, as well.	Eye ewɔ nuku nɛ, nenema ke.
Not here, not for him either.	Menye afisia o, menye na eya hã o.
Up and down, up and down.	Dzi kple anyi, dzi kple anyi.
Inside, he was comfortable.	Le eme la, eƒe dzi dze eme.
But it’s not what it really is.	Gake menye alesi wòle ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Stay away from hard work.	Te ɖa le dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ ŋu.
I don’t know where to go now.	Nyemenya afi si mayi fifia o.
Maybe for hours.	Ðewohĩ gaƒoƒo geɖe.
There were so many parts to this.	Akpa geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ esia ŋu.
Things are not so simple.	Nuwo mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
He had a good life.	Agbe nyui aɖe nɔ esi.
In the end, he couldn’t.	Mlɔeba la, mete ŋui o.
A lot of people.	Ame geɖe ŋutɔ.
What could be more relaxing?	Nukae ate ŋu aɖe dzi ɖi wu?
Add water to it.	Tsɔ tsi de eme.
Otherwise, you will get tired.	Ne menye nenema o la, ɖeɖi ate ŋuwò.
He didn’t seem too nervous.	Edze abe metsi dzodzodzoe akpa o ene.
Not exactly in a position to react in all anger.	Menye nɔnɔme si me wòate ŋu awɔ nu kple dziku katã me tututu o.
But that changed last year.	Gake ema trɔ le ƒe si va yi me.
A lot can happen in that time.	Nu geɖe ate ŋu adzɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
But he never said anything to her.	Gake megblɔ nya aɖeke nɛ kpɔ o.
His character is different .	Eƒe nɔnɔme to vovo .
No one else is alive.	Ame bubu aɖeke mele agbe o.
And yet here you are.	Eye ke hã wòe nye esi.
Your life depends on it.	Wò agbe nɔ te ɖe edzi.
The man who used to own this building is now dead.	Ŋutsu si si xɔ sia nɔ tsã la ku fifia.
And it always will be.	Eye anɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi.
Everything is gone.	Nusianu nu yi.
There was something he had never heard before.	Nane nɔ anyi si mese kpɔ o.
It was a good idea, but flawed.	Enye susu nyui aɖe, gake vodada nɔ eme.
I am the truth without anyone.	Nyee nye nyateƒe la ame aɖeke manɔmee.
He doesn’t seem to be able to do that.	Edze abe ɖe mate ŋu awɔe nenema o ene.
They don’t have to do things.	Mehiã be woawɔ nuwo o.
There was absolutely nothing.	Naneke menɔ anyi kura o.
It’s not very exciting.	Menye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ o.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe aɖe vi ŋutɔ.
But that’s OK, too.	Gake ema hã sɔ.
Water is a little low.	Tsi le sue vie.
It worked too well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie akpa.
The police looked into that.	Kpovitɔwo lé ŋku ɖe nya ma ŋu.
He almost liked her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ kloe.
And it can’t happen either.	Eye mate ŋu adzɔ hã o.
I did another one.	Mewɔ bubu.
I’ve been here before.	Meva afisia kpɔ.
Your mind may be skeptical.	Ðewohĩ wò susu ake ɖi.
Perhaps there is something we can do.	Ðewohĩ nane li míate ŋu awɔ.
It was never his own idea.	Enye eya ŋutɔ ƒe susu kpɔ o.
I always do this.	Mewɔa esia ɣesiaɣi.
He worked as a teacher for many years.	Ewɔ dɔ abe nufiala ene ƒe geɖe.
I did the same thing.	Mewɔe nenema ke.
Which would be better.	Kae anyo wu.
There was something between all of us.	Nane nɔ mía katã dome.

It won’t bother me.	Maɖe fu nam o.

I couldn’t tell who it was.	Nyemete ŋu nya amesi wònye o.
He really has a way about it.	Mɔ aɖe le esi ku ɖe eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s all it is.	Esia koe wònye.

It’s not that you can’t talk.	Menye be màte ŋu aƒo nu o.

But he didn’t say anything.	Gake megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Not in this life, anyway.	Menye le agbe sia me o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Tonight was not one of them.	Zã sia menye wo dometɔ ɖeka o.
He didn’t make a big deal out of it.	Mewɔ nu gã aɖeke tso eme o.
My life is still the same.	Nye agbe gakpɔtɔ le nenema.
I wouldn’t mind doing that myself, really.	Maɖe fu nam be nye ŋutɔ mawɔ ema o, le nyateƒe me.

Pretend it doesn’t exist.	Wɔ abe ɖe meli o ene.
The house work required many hours.	Aƒea ƒe dɔa bia gaƒoƒo geɖe.

In fact, neither did anyone else.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame bubu aɖeke hã mewɔe nenema o.

At this point, he’s had enough.	Le afisia la, eƒe nu sɔ gbɔ nɛ.
And in this case, of course, it didn’t.	Eye le go sia me la, le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
But under no circumstances can he go in himself.	Gake le nɔnɔme aɖeke me la, eya ŋutɔ mate ŋu ayi ɖe eme o.
There was finally a bit of common ground.	Nu ɖeka aɖe va nɔ wo dome vie mlɔeba.
You are not me.	Menye nyee nènye o.
You’re expecting that.	Èle mɔ kpɔm na ema.
Two things can happen.	Nu eve ate ŋu ado mo ɖa.
The building is ours.	Xɔa nye mía tɔ.
But also think about what you want.	Gake bu nusi nèdi hã ŋu kpɔ.
Right through his hand.	To eƒe asi me tututu.
I’ve heard about you.	Mese nu tso ŋuwò.
Hold on from it.	Lé ɖe asi tso eme.
It’s a very complicated thing.	Enye nusi sesẽ ŋutɔ.
The work is very demanding.	Dɔa bia nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
This changed over time.	Esia trɔ le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe.
He was the only one who survived.	Eya ɖeka koe tsi agbe.
Which makes sense again.	Nusi me susu le ake.
You know so much.	Ènya nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
But it obviously happened.	Gake edze ƒã be edzɔ.
They are my water.	Wole nye tsi.
Many of us have done that.	Mía dometɔ geɖe wɔe nenema.
We have too many other problems now.	Kuxi bubu geɖe akpa le mía ŋu fifia.
Nothing at all is very stable.	Naneke kura meli ke tututu o.
He didn’t know who he was, who any of them were.	Menya amesi wònye, amesi wo dometɔ aɖeke nye o.
It’s a no-brainer.	Enye nusi me susu mele o.
There was nothing he could see that he didn’t like.	Naneke meli si wòate ŋu akpɔ si medze eŋu o.
I knew he couldn’t.	Menya be mate ŋui o.
There was great opportunity here.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe nɔ afisia.
Want to keep going.	Di be yeayi edzi.
A snake ran past him.	Da aɖe ƒu du to eŋu.
It will be short due to time constraints.	Anɔ kpuie le ɣeyiɣi ƒe sesẽ ta.
We don’t know you.	Míenya wò o.
Hold on tightly to it.	Lé ɖe eŋu sesĩe.
He had no characteristics.	Nɔnɔme aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
There was a lot of blood in the car.	Ʋu geɖe nɔ ʋua me.
It’s not that I don’t want to do it, I want to.	Menye ɖe nyemedi be mawɔe o, medi.
There were some bright spots though.	Teƒe aɖewo siwo me kɔ la nɔ anyi gake.
I hope to be active in that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mado vevie nu le ema me.
I have to move on.	Ele be mayi ŋgɔ.
There is a reason for this.	Susu aɖe tae esia le.
I don't want to know.	Madi be manya.
That was my first thought.	Emae nye nye susu gbãtɔ.
That’s pretty easy, too.	Ema hã le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
That’s just you.	Wò koe nye ema.
No one at all knows the truth.	Ame aɖeke kura menya nyateƒea o.
Forget about tomorrow.	Ŋlɔ etsɔ si gbɔna la be.
It didn’t feel like a good thing.	Mese le eɖokui me be enye nu nyui aɖeke o.
A very, very different person.	Ame si to vovo kura, si to vovo kura.
If you know more, get in touch.	Ne ènya nu geɖe la, ke te ɖe ŋuwò.
The room was very small.	Xɔa nɔ sue ŋutɔ.
Everything must be in its own way.	Ele be nusianu nanɔ eƒe mɔ nu.
This is his own.	Esia nye eya ŋutɔ tɔ.
All is well in the work.	Nusianu le nyuie le dɔa me.
It was such a big deal for me.	Enye nu gã aɖe nam nenema gbegbe.
This is just the same thing.	Esia nye nu ɖeka ma ke ko.
I have seen this before.	Mekpɔ esia do ŋgɔ.
The road between is difficult.	Mɔ si le wo dome la sesẽ.
Go on and on and on.	Yi edzi kple edzi.
It’s a good thing, a good thing that he’s here.	Enye nu nyui aɖe, nu nyui aɖe be ele afisia.
Something is wrong with this situation.	Nane gblẽ le nɔnɔme sia ŋu.
The work was exhausting.	Dɔa te ɖeɖi ame ŋu ŋutɔ.
He has a great job.	Dɔ gã aɖe le esi.
This is not working.	Esia mele dɔ wɔm o.
We are just like that.	Ðeko míele nenema.
And he made a mistake.	Eye wòwɔ vodada.
You have to work the easy way.	Ele be nàwɔ dɔ le mɔ bɔbɔe la nu.
A kind of .	Ƒomevi aɖe si nye .
Is that what it is.	Ðe emae nye nu si.
Weeks later, he still hadn’t approved.	Kwasiɖa aɖewo megbe la, meva da asi ɖe edzi haɖe o.
Up to this point.	Vaseɖe afisia.
I did the same and did well.	Mewɔ nenema ke eye mewɔ dɔ nyuie.
Some species of snakes have no legs.	Afɔ mele da ƒomevi aɖewo ŋu o.
It was a pleasure to talk to them.	Enye dzidzɔ nam be maƒo nu kpli wo.
I look forward to doing them all.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie na wo katã wɔwɔ.
But perhaps few people know about.	Gake ɖewohĩ ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nya nu tso.
And hear this.	Eye se nya sia.
It was to protect myself.	Enye be makpɔ ɖokuinye ta.
Forget that small is good.	Ŋlɔ be be nu sue nyo.
I can be a part of that.	Mate ŋu anye ema ƒe akpa aɖe.
I’m not having a hard time at school.	Nyemele ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe me tom le suku o.
I need a little hand.	Mehiã asi vi aɖe.
He couldn’t remember.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi o.
I think I can fight you.	Mesusu be mate ŋu awɔ avu kpli wò.
This is a lie.	Esia nye alakpa.
We were actually a small contributor to that a little bit.	Le nyateƒe me la, míenye nu sue aɖe si kpe asi ɖe ema ŋu vie.
That will be your job.	Emae anye wò dɔ.
Nothing is alive.	Naneke mele agbe o.
I finally died.	Meva ku mlɔeba.
No one is going to listen to me.	Ame aɖeke mele to ɖo ge nam o.
That is very important.	Ema le vevie ŋutɔ.
I knew he would be pleased.	Menya be adzɔ dzi nɛ.
I was just worried.	Ðeko metsi dzi.
That’s a lot of it.	Ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
We are here for you.	Míele afisia na wò.
Enter one first name.	Ŋlɔ ŋkɔ gbãtɔ ɖeka ɖe eme.
But not too big either.	Gake menye gã akpa hã o.
In fact, we can’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, míate ŋui o.
We don’t know why that guy did that.	Míenya nu si tae ŋutsu ma wɔ nu ma ɖo o.
It is the first thing.	Enye nu gbãtɔ.
Thanks in advance again.	Akpe na mi do ŋgɔ ake.
Clearly, it could have been important today.	Edze ƒã be ate ŋu anɔ vevie egbea hafi.
You can stay here or go home or whatever.	Àte ŋu anɔ afisia alo ayi aƒeme alo nusianu si nàwɔ.
He didn’t know this place existed.	Menya be teƒe sia li o.
It may not be for some.	Ðewohĩ manɔ na ame aɖewo o.
He would have none of it.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke manɔ esi o.
This is just one city.	Du ɖeka koe nye esia.
Just like new.	Abe yeye ene ko.
The opposite is true.	Nusi to vovo na emae.
It’s a very bad thing.	Enye nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔ.
He has been waiting since morning.	Ele lalam tso ŋdi ke.
Things are now well between you and me.	Nuwo le mía kpli wò dome nyuie azɔ.
And what is this ? 	Eye nukae nye esia?
I think this is a great idea.	Mesusu be esia nye susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I don’t feel that way today.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema egbea o.
His own.	Eya ŋutɔ tɔ.
I'm just going to listen.	Ðeko mele to ɖo ge.
Not because you think you can walk on me.	Menye esi nèsusu be yeate ŋu azɔ le dzinye tae o.
I haven’t heard back from them yet.	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso wo gbɔ haɖe o.
I hope you enjoy them.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wo adzɔ dzi na wò.
This will never work.	Esia mawɔ dɔ gbeɖe o.
No one knew where he was.	Ame aɖeke menya afisi wònɔ o.
I would have nothing like that.	Naneke manɔ asinye abe ema ene o.
But that was lost.	Gake ema bu.
Nothing new and fresh will ever happen.	Naneke yeye kple yeye aɖeke mava dzɔ gbeɖe o.
Not the kind of place you want to be.	Menye teƒe si ƒomevi nèdi be yeanɔ ye o.
He didn’t do it either.	Mewɔe hã o.
Let that do what you want.	Na ema wɔ nusi nèdi.
Give it plenty of water.	Na tsi nyuie.
I don’t want to go home.	Nyemedi be mayi aƒe o.
I didn’t expect him to.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be awɔe nenema o.
Death with you.	Ku kpli wò.
Stay in one place.	Nɔ teƒe ɖeka.
In the first place, we can do nothing.	Le go gbãtɔ me la, míate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
He doesn’t do any of them.	Mewɔa wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
That’s the right order.	Emae nye ɖoɖo si sɔ.
He is with them now.	Ele wo gbɔ fifia.
One never knows.	Ame menya gbeɖe o.
On his part, he said.	Le eƒe akpa dzi.
And he didn’t say exactly why he was calling.	Eye megblɔ nusita tututu wòle ka ƒom ɖo o.
And that makes it very important.	Eye ema na wòle vevie ŋutɔ.
The water there had a name.	Ŋkɔ nɔ tsi si nɔ afima ŋu.
No one recognized them.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ wo dze sii o.
We have to work.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ.
I was on the job.	Menɔ dɔa dzi.
He couldn’t remember.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi o.
Not because he’s great.	Menye esi wònye ame gã aɖe tae o.
Everyone is fine with me.	Ame sia ame le nyuie nam.
I tried to do too much.	Medze agbagba be mawɔ nu geɖe akpa.
His death means a lot.	Eƒe ku fia nu geɖe.
Will this allow it.	Ðe esia aɖe mɔ.
That life was over for him.	Agbe ma nu va yi nɛ.
Please suggest a suggestion.	Taflatse do susu aɖe ɖa.
I made my way home myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mewɔ mɔ yi aƒeme.
During the day, he cannot eat.	Le ŋkeke me la, mate ŋu aɖu nu o.
But it looks good, too.	Gake edze nyuie, eya hã.
Lower it a little.	Ðe anyi vie.
Tell me where it is.	Gblɔ afi si wòle nam.
To get to know you a little bit.	Be manya wò vie.
He was someone else.	Ame bubu aɖee wònye.
These things take a lot of time.	Nu siawo xɔa ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
I don’t really know what this means.	Nyemenya nusi tututu nya sia fia o.
Not without a plan.	Menye ɖoɖo aɖeke manɔmee o.
That I would be alone.	Be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi.
He couldn’t be sure.	Mete ŋu ka ɖe edzi o.
For absolutely no reason.	Le susu aɖeke kura ta o.
And he has a gun.	Eye tu le esi.
There is no big deal.	Nya gã aɖeke meli o.
But everyone went on with their lives.	Gake amesiame yi eƒe agbe dzi.
Very few of them do.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ koe wɔa esia.
This "water" will not dissipate.	"Tsi" sia maɖe eɖokui ɖa o.
Which is very difficult.	Nusi sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Thank you so much for yours.	Akpe geɖe na mi.
He doesn’t have much money.	Ga boo aɖeke mele esi o.
Happiness overwhelmed him.	Dzidzɔ xɔ aƒe ɖe edzi.
Which served to remind him that .	Nusi wɔ dɔ tsɔ ɖo ŋku edzi nɛ be .
People rushed over to ask what was wrong.	Amewo ƒu du va bia nusi gblẽ le eŋu.
Maybe that’s why.	Ðewohĩ ema tae.
We are not looking for this.	Míele esia dim o.
Maybe it’s damaged.	Ðewohĩ nu gblẽ le eŋu.
Now think about this.	Azɔ bu esia ŋu kpɔ.
He can save her.	Ate ŋu aɖee.
Fall in anger.	Dze anyi le dziku me.
But there’s demand there too.	Gake didi le afima hã.
That's just too long.	Ðeko ema didi akpa.
I did relax a bit.	Meɖe dzi ɖi vie nyateƒe.
Day in, day in.	Ŋkeke le, ŋkeke me.
Please help me do it.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye mawɔe.
I know everything you have to say.	Menya nya sia nya si wòle be nàgblɔ.
He lost a lot of blood.	Ʋu geɖe bu nɛ.
The word comes out.	Nya la doa go.
Nothing was important.	Naneke menɔ vevie o.
He had never wanted anything so badly.	Medi naneke vevie nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
Clearly, something is wrong.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ.
That’s what it is.	Emae nye ema.
That was just as well.	Ema hã nɔ nyuie nenema ke.
That one just isn’t the whole truth.	Ðeko ɖeka ma koe menye nyateƒe bliboa o.
I just love your work.	Ðeko wò dɔa dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
That’s that for us.	Emae nye ema na mí.
But, no one knows what will happen.	Gake, ame aɖeke menya nusi adzɔ o.
Can't remember his name.	Mate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi o.
Thank you so much for the clever and wonderful help.	Akpe geɖe na mi ɖe kpekpeɖeŋu si me aɖaŋu le eye wòwɔ nuku la ta.
That is very important to me.	Ema le vevie nam ŋutɔ.
That was a huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖee nye ema.
I couldn’t wait to see them.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ wo o.
It can happen to anyone.	Ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe ame sia ame dzi.
Otherwise, he could never join her.	Ne menye nenema o la, mate ŋu awɔ ɖeka kplii gbeɖe o.
But come out.	Gake va do.
Many couldn’t stand it.	Ame geɖe mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
An obvious absence.	Nusi meli si dze ƒã o.
That’s a very bad idea.	Ema nye susu gbegblẽ ŋutɔ.
That’s a good thing.	Nya nyui aɖee nye ema.
Here is one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖekae nye esi.
But there is nothing.	Gake naneke meli o.
This year never came.	Ƒe sia meva kpɔ o.
But eat now.	Gake ɖu nu fifia.
In more, that one was in it.	Le geɖe wu me la, ɖeka ma nɔ eme.
Two problems became apparent as a result.	Kuxi eve va dze ƒã le esia ta.
Where did that come from?	Afikae nya ma tso?
I'm looking for a place to stay tonight.	Mele teƒe aɖe dim manɔ le zã sia me.
There is room for them there.	Teƒe na wo le afima.
I stood behind him.	Metsi tre ɖe megbe nɛ.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Naneke mele ema ŋu o.
Looks like he needs one.	Edze abe ehiã ɖeka ene.
The king was in no hurry.	Fia la mewɔ kaba o.
The man who knows you.	Ŋutsu si nya wò la.
And a kind of.	Eye ƒomevi aɖe.
I might have been a good person.	Ðewohĩ menye ame nyui aɖe hafi.
Now everything is working fine.	Fifia nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie.
And this is good.	Eye esia nyo.
I have a big hole now.	Do gã aɖe le asinye fifia.
This is not to be done.	Menye ɖe wòle be woawɔ esia o.
Things got out of hand.	Nuwo do le asi me.
It’s just the other way around.	Ðeko wòle mɔ bubu nu.
I want to know everything about it.	Medi be manya nusianu tso eŋu.
Let them act on it.	Na woawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu.
Nobody knows what people will get out of there.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi amewo ado tso afima o.
Everything seems to be in place now.	Edze abe nusianu le teƒe si wòle fifia ene.
He is looking for himself.	Ele eɖokui dim.
Otherwise, it will be fine.	Ne menye nenema o la, anyo.
That he couldn’t understand.	Be mete ŋu se egɔme o.
I like many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe dzɔa dzi nam.
My people know very little about it.	Nye amewo nya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o.
Stay on the road.	Nɔ mɔ dzi.
I don’t mean to surprise you.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔ nuku na wò o.
I got a bad attitude.	Mexɔ nɔnɔme gbegblẽ aɖe.
Test us out.	Do mí kpɔ.
It’s not more complicated than that.	Menye nusi sesẽ wu ema o.
I don’t think he wants to be, but he is.	Nyemesusu be medi be yeanɔ nenema o, gake ele nenema.
Too long a time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
But that sounded	Gake nya ma ɖi .
As in many other things.	Abe alesi wòle le nu bubu geɖe me ene.
It didn’t make much sense to me.	Susu aɖeke menɔ eme nam boo o.
Some parts are expensive.	Akpa aɖewo xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
So far, none of them have.	Vaseɖe fifia la, wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
It might be a bad thing, of course.	Ðewohĩ anye nu gbegblẽ ya.
Anything can be food.	Nusianu ate ŋu anye nuɖuɖu.
We only know this exact moment.	Ɣeyiɣi sia tututu koe míenya.
He just wasn’t in his room.	Ðeko menɔ eƒe xɔ me o.
The tribe is two-sided.	To la nye akpa eve.
However, many others are not so convinced.	Ke hã, ame bubu geɖe meka ɖe edzi nenema o.
I can’t save everyone.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe ame sia ame o.
Someone who is very valuable.	Ame aɖe si xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
That was another time.	Ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖee nye ema.
Something legitimate, something important.	Nane si le se nu, nane si le vevie.
Or a lot of things.	Alo nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
In fact, I was planning to do the same thing.	Le nyateƒe me la, nye hã menɔ ɖoɖo wɔm be mawɔ nu ma ke.
It would be surprising if he was right.	Awɔ nuku ŋutɔ ne eƒe nya le eteƒe.
But with this, me, me.	Gake kple esia la, nye, nye.
Not for anyone.	Menye na ame aɖeke o.
This room is too expensive!	Xɔ sia xɔ asi akpa!
Some people are not old enough.	Ame aɖewo metsi o.
Within a few months.	Le ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo ko me.
We can’t see it.	Míate ŋu akpɔ nu o.
He couldn’t get enough.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
Go on and on and on.	Yi edzi kple edzi.
Just go here.	Yi afisia ko.
One of the longer ones.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka si didi wu.
There is only one thing.	Nu ɖeka koe.
He was obviously pleased.	Edze ƒã be edzɔ dzi nɛ.
It's like the thing before it.	Ele abe nu si do ŋgɔ nɛ ene.
I can’t tell people these things. 	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya siawo na amewo o. 
Since the first date is in a string.	Esi wònye be ŋkeke gbãtɔ le ka me ta la.
He couldn’t see.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nu o.
You can stay in it.	Àte ŋu anɔ eme.
There is little we can do about that now.	Nu sue aɖe koe míate ŋu awɔ tso ema ŋu fifia.
It’s not enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
Very much happiness.	Dzidzɔ geɖe ŋutɔ.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
They only have each other.	Wo nɔewo koe le wo si.
That would be really useful.	Ema aɖe vi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t know how he got on.	Nyemenya alesi wòwɔ ge ɖe edzi o.
He needed something better.	Ehiã nane si nyo wu.
It looks like it may not.	Edze abe ɖewohĩ mewɔe nenema o ene.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
You can try this yourself.	Wò ŋutɔ àte ŋu ate esia kpɔ.
And maybe that will just work.	Eye ɖewohĩ ema awɔ dɔ ko.
This will require careful planning.	Esia ahiã be woawɔ ɖoɖo nyuie.
It could have been me.	Ate ŋu anye nye ŋutɔ hafi.
We must act now.	Ele be míawɔ nu fifia.
But anything is possible.	Gake nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
Just in case something happens.	Nenye be nane dzɔ ko.
That’s the last one.	Emae nye mamlɛtɔ.
He was seriously ill.	Edze dɔ vevie.
It’s not really in it.	Menye ɖe wòle eme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Not really too much extra.	Menye le nyateƒe me la, nu geɖe akpa kpe ɖe eŋu o.
Some people seem to have done so.	Edze abe ame aɖewo wɔe nenema ene.
That you liked him.	Be eƒe nu lé dzi na wò.
Let me tell you a few things.	Mina magblɔ nya ʋɛ aɖewo na mi.
A few days passed by.	Ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo va yi.
It is now expected.	Wole mɔ kpɔm nɛ fifia.
It couldn’t have been good.	Mate ŋu anyo hafi o.
I remember feeling great about it.	Meɖo ŋku edzi be mese le ɖokuinye me ŋutɔ le eŋu.
Just more than ever.	Nusi wu ɣesiaɣi ko.
I really needed that.	Mehiã ema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
No one is a newcomer.	Ame aɖeke menye ame yeye aɖeke o.
Many people approached each other.	Ame geɖe te ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
A good person.	Ame nyui aɖe.
A bad thing.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
He doesn’t think his life is my fault.	Mesusu be yeƒe agbe nye nye vodada o.
Not sure what this means.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi esia fia dzi o.
I don’t know what to do with it.	Nyemenya nu si mawɔ kplii o.
He has his whole life ahead of him.	Eƒe agbe bliboa le ŋgɔ nɛ.
Everything is fine so far.	Nusianu nyo vaseɖe fifia.
He couldn’t speak at all.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu kura o.
But let time work for you, rather than for time.	Gake na ɣeyiɣi nawɔ dɔ na wò, tsɔ wu be wòawɔ dɔ na ɣeyiɣi.
I think there is one small problem.	Mesusu be kuxi sue ɖeka aɖe li.
I understand time.	Mese ɣeyiɣi gɔme.
I liked him too.	Nye hã eƒe nu lé dzi nam.
Maybe he already has one.	Ðewohĩ ɖeka le esi xoxo.
Each and every one is different.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe kple wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
It just didn’t work.	Ðeko wòwɔ dɔ o.
Find a job.	Di dɔ aɖe.
And that’s what’s right for him.	Eye emae nye nu si sɔ nɛ.
That made everyone laugh.	Ema na amesiame ko nu.
He can explain it.	Ate ŋu aɖe eme.
No horses, for one thing.	Sɔ aɖeke meli o, le nu ɖeka ta.
Not exactly, anyway.	Menye tututu o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Maybe they don’t have the money.	Ðewohĩ ga mele wo si o.
What a good idea.	Susu nyui kae nye si.
I want to make that money.	Medi be makpɔ ga ma.
He couldn't stop now.	Mete ŋu tɔ te fifia o.
Many of them killed someone.	Wo dometɔ geɖe wu ame aɖe.
There is nothing I can do.	Naneke meli si mawɔ o.
I never knew you could do this.	Nyemenya kpɔ be àte ŋu awɔ esia o.
He has a reputation for being unkind.	Ŋkɔ le eŋu be enye ame si mewɔa nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu nyuie o.

I wasn’t sure it would happen.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be ava eme o.

The house is close to the lake.	Aƒea te ɖe ta la ŋu.

Each and every morning.	Ŋdi ɖesiaɖe kple ŋdi sia ŋdi.
I am in this market.	Mele asi sia me.
I will say exactly this.	Magblɔ nya sia tututu.
I am moving forward tonight.	Mele ŋgɔ yim le zã sia me.
A man who is different.	Ŋutsu si to vovo.
It hurt us so much.	Eve mí ŋutɔ.
He lived alone in a small house.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ aƒe sue aɖe me.
We can’t do that yet.	Míate ŋu awɔ ema haɖe o.
Focus on the task at hand.	Wò susu nanɔ dɔ si le asiwò la ŋu.
It is much more complicated than that.	Enye nusi sesẽ wu ema kura.
Everyone was stunned.	Amesiame ƒe nu ku.
There was just so much he didn’t know about her.	Ðeko nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi si menya tso eŋu o.
Now, get in here.	Azɔ, ge ɖe afisia.
Just tell me which one you want.	Ðeko nàgblɔ esi nèdi nam.
Mistakes can also be costly.	Vodada ate ŋu axɔ ga geɖe hã.
Contact us today.	Te ɖe mía ŋu egbea.
It was a good one.	Enye ɖeka nyui aɖe.
Lower the car.	Ðe ʋua ɖe anyi.
One is fine, one is not.	Ame ɖeka ƒe nɔnɔme le nyuie, ame ɖeka ya mele eme o.
I'm kind of not sure.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi le mɔ aɖe nu o.
He could have answered this question.	Ate ŋu aɖo nya sia ŋu hafi.
Yet we know little about any of them.	Ke hã míenya nu boo aɖeke tso wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o.
Nothing and no one.	Naneke meli o eye ame aɖeke hã meli o.
I don’t know if any of us are ready for that.	Nyemenya ne mía dometɔ aɖeke le klalo na ema o.
Almost every building here is slightly damaged.	Xɔ ɖesiaɖe kloe si le afisia gblẽ vie.
He had obviously done this before.	Edze ƒã be ewɔ esia do ŋgɔ.
Stop doing that.	Dzudzɔ ema wɔwɔ.
Many roads are badly damaged.	Mɔ geɖe gblẽ vevie.
Strong in the following direction.	Sesẽ le mɔ si gbɔna la dzi.
The project is almost complete.	Dɔa wu enu kloe.
Thank you for that.	Akpe na mi ɖe ema ta.
We need to do this more often.	Ele be míawɔ esia zi geɖe wu.
I can get there easily enough.	Mate ŋu aɖo afima bɔbɔe alesi dze.
I was kind of a big deal.	Menye nu gã aɖe ƒomevi aɖe.
This is also true here.	Esia nye nyateƒe le afisia hã.
I got me some money.	Mekpɔ ga aɖe nam.
Try very hard.	Dze agbagba vevie ŋutɔ.
Something made me do that.	Nane na mewɔe nenema.
This is too important.	Esia le vevie akpa.
He was annoyed by all the attention.	Alesi amewo katã lé ŋku ɖe eŋu la do dziku nɛ.
I had a dress.	Awu aɖe nɔ asinye.
What he was trying to do.	Nusi wònɔ agbagba dzem be yeawɔ.
A heavily armed police force moved in.	Kpovitɔwo ƒe ha si tsɔ tu vevie la ʋu va afima.
His heart didn’t.	Eƒe dzi mewɔe nenema o.
Otherwise, it's a no-brainer.	Ne menye nenema o la, enye nusi me susu mele o.
I think that’s the most appropriate thing to do.	Mesusu be emae nye nusi sɔ wu be woawɔ.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
Perhaps we are making a mistake.	Ðewohĩ míele vodada aɖe wɔm.
That’s not a new thing.	Ema menye nu yeye o.
Granted, it was a bit watery.	Ele eme be tsi nɔ eme vie ya.
It’s not surprising.	Mewɔ nuku o.
Anyone can see anyone else.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu akpɔ ame bubu ɖesiaɖe.
We all know what happened next.	Mí katã míenya nu si dzɔ le ema megbe.
We are all the same person.	Mí katã míenye ame ɖeka.
You may lose your job.	Ðewohĩ dɔ ge le asiwò.
I had a problem.	Kuxi aɖe va dze dzinye.
And that requires money.	Eye ema bia ga.
But that is a different matter.	Gake nya ma to vovo.
I did it that way.	Mewɔe nenema.
It doesn’t matter.	Mele vevie o.
Everything happened very quickly.	Nusianu dzɔ kaba ŋutɔ.
He can talk in or out of anything.	Ate ŋu aƒo nu tso nusianu me alo ado le eme.
There is no money there.	Ga aɖeke mele afima o.
I don’t want to.	Nyemedi o.
Exactly the same thing.	Nu ma ke tututu.
Whoever did this to me.	Ame sia ame si wɔ nu sia ɖe ŋunye.
I could never stay in water.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ tsi me gbeɖe o.
It’s way too expensive.	Eƒe mɔ ƒe asi gbɔ eme.
Check out what happened to him.	Kpɔ nu si dzɔ ɖe edzi la ɖa.
Everyone came through.	Amesiame va to eme.
An uncharacteristic rage overtook him at that moment.	Dziku aɖe si me nɔnɔme aɖeke mele o la va dze edzi le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
You are in the clear.	Èle nusi me kɔ la me.
I don’t want to be anywhere else.	Nyemedi be manɔ teƒe bubu aɖeke o.
I can’t believe this either!	Nye hã nyemate ŋu axɔ esia dzi ase o!
You can’t take it out.	Màte ŋu aɖee le eme o.
Some people have time.	Ɣeyiɣi le ame aɖewo si.
That can’t possibly work.	Ema mate ŋu awɔ dɔ o.
To this day, he has never said anything about it.	Vaseɖe egbea la, megblɔ nya aɖeke tso eŋu kpɔ o.
Not at all.	Menye nenema kura o.
I almost certainly will.	Mawɔe godoo kloe.
It was such a silly mistake.	Enye vodada si me susu mele o ale gbegbe.
This is a good thing .	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe .
Try somewhere else maybe.	Te teƒe bubu aɖe kpɔ ɖewohĩ.
Nice to meet you too.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò hã.
This suddenly changed.	Esia trɔ zi ɖeka.
I started searching as soon as his name appeared.	Medze didi gɔme esi eƒe ŋkɔ dze ko.
We don’t have a dog.	Avu mele mía si o.
They are doing something else.	Wole nu bubu aɖe wɔm.
Make a plan for it.	Wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
Maybe some of them are here now.	Ðewohĩ wo dometɔ aɖewo le afisia fifia.
The same thing happened.	Nu ma ke do tso eme.
I was never sure.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi gbeɖe o.
In my own language.	Le nye ŋutɔ nye gbe me.
I also wanted a name.	Medi ŋkɔ hã.
That’s for you to do.	Ema nye na wò be nàwɔ.
He did everything else very well.	Ewɔ nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nyuie ŋutɔ.
We’re doing something else here, after all.	Míele nu bubu aɖe wɔm le afisia, le nyateƒe me.
No one was going to get on me.	Ame aɖeke menɔ dzinye xɔ ge o.
Return to this project.	Trɔ yi dɔ sia gbɔ.
It wasn’t too late.	Metsi megbe boo o.
He's not doing anything.	Menye naneke wɔm wòle o.
The following conditions apply.	Nɔnɔme siwo gbɔna la sɔ.
Parts of it.	Eƒe akpa aɖewo.
He hung the rope around her neck.	Etsɔ ka la ƒo ɖe kɔ nɛ.
The idea behind the room escaped me.	Susu si le megbe na xɔa la si le menye.
There are two aspects to this.	Akpa eve le esia ŋu.
But not too hard.	Gake menye sesẽ akpa o.
If he was still in charge.	Nenye be eya gakpɔtɔ nɔ dɔa dzi kpɔm.
It is what it is.	Enye nusi wònye.
No work, no money.	Dɔ aɖeke meli o, ga aɖeke meli o.
He doesn’t have much money.	Ga boo aɖeke mele esi o.
It could be this way or that way.	Ate ŋu anye mɔ sia alo mɔ ma nu.
This guy doesn’t have money.	Ga mele ŋutsu sia si o.
He wasn't sure what he was ready for.	Meka ɖe nusi wòle klalo na dzi o.
He didn’t say anything either.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke hã o.
How many roads are there in this city?	Mɔ nenie le du sia me?
Guess who was on that?.	Bu eŋu kpɔ be amekae nɔ nya ma dzi?.
He had a strong face.	Mo sesẽ nɔ esi.
You have the word and you have the word.	Nya la le asiwò eye nya la le asiwò.
Come on you know it is.	Va ènya be ele nenema.
I can definitely do that.	Mate ŋu awɔe nenema godoo.
That turned my head.	Ema trɔ nye ta.
I don’t think he would.	Nyemesusu be awɔe nenema o.
They’re all on it.	Wo katã wole edzi.
She needs a good man.	Ehiã ŋutsu nyui aɖe.
It doesn’t surprise him at all.	Mewɔa nuku nɛ kura o.
What is important.	Nukae le vevie.
But some of them are.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖewo ya.
My name was on it.	Nye ŋkɔ nɔ edzi.
Not now, maybe not anymore.	Menye fifia o, ɖewohĩ megale nenema o.
I understood it perfectly.	Mese egɔme nyuie.
But today is an exception.	Gake egbea hã nye esi to vovo.
I tried to do everything myself.	Nye ŋutɔ medze agbagba be mawɔ nusianu.
There are two reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo tae esia tso.
But we can do something about it.	Gake míate ŋu awɔ nane tso eŋu.
Now, think about it for a moment.	Azɔ, bu eŋu kpɔ vie.
My life depends on it.	Nye agbe nɔ te ɖe edzi.
Have some respect for yourself.	Bubu aɖe nanɔ ŋuwò.
He looked tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ene.
She gave birth to a child.	Edzi vi.
He didn’t have any money.	Ga aɖeke menɔ esi o.
And what it did for me.	Eye nusi wòwɔ nam.
At that point in time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
That time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi ma va yi.
He obviously has that.	Edze ƒã be ema le esi.
Think that might be good too.	Bu eŋu kpɔ be ema hã ate ŋu anyo.
That saved me.	Ema xɔ nam.
It did start.	Edze egɔme nyateƒe.
As long as you want.	Zi alesi nèdi.
Which did little to challenge him.	Nusi mewɔ nu boo aɖeke tsɔ tsɔ nya ɖe eŋu o.
I don’t think it could get any easier.	Nyemesusu be ate ŋu ava nɔ bɔbɔe wu ema o.
Everyone now has one tooth.	Aɖu ɖeka le amesiame si fifia.
And he has too much money.	Eye ga si sɔ gbɔ akpa le esi.
Come on, get dressed.	Va, do awu.
If only it could have been me.	Ne ɖe wòate ŋu anye nye ŋutɔ.
Now he’s at peace.	Fifia eƒe dzi dze eme.
And that’s exciting.	Eye esia doa dzidzɔ na ame.
I found another way.	Mekpɔ mɔ bubu aɖe.
Two very different people.	Ame eve siwo to vovo kura.
But he couldn’t.	Gake mete ŋui o.
You don’t want to be anywhere near there tonight.	Mèdi be yeanɔ afi aɖeke si te ɖe afima ŋu le zã sia me o.
I did a great job.	Mewɔ dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
We can’t do that here.	Míate ŋu awɔ ema le afisia o.
Thousands of jobs have been lost.	Dɔ akpe geɖe bu.
Not very often.	Menye zi geɖe ŋutɔ o.
Yet he was still not happy.	Ke hã mekpɔ dzidzɔ kokoko o.
It can get hot in there.	Ate ŋu axɔ dzo le afima.
I know now that you don’t have money.	Menya fifia be ga mele asiwò o.

I would be very happy.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
As it is, it is.	Abe alesi wòle ene.
This year more than ever.	Le ƒe sia me wu tsã.
Two chapters are better than one.	Ta eve nyo wu ɖeka.
He never came.	Meva kpɔ o.
I felt wonderful about it.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ le eŋu.
And a lot of books.	Eye agbalẽ geɖe hã.
Not of previous years.	Menye ƒe siwo va yi me tɔ o.

How many years have you worked here?	Ƒe nenie nèwɔ dɔ le afisia?
Let’s have the money.	Mina ga la nanɔ mía si.
It's a bit surreal.	Enye nusi me susu mele o vie.
But that doesn’t matter.	Gake ema mehiã o.
I surprised him a lot.	Mewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
Many deaths.	Ku geɖe.
He started well, seemed like a nice guy.	Edze egɔme nyuie, edze abe ŋutsu nyui aɖe ene.
However, that is also a problem.	Ke hã, ema hã nye kuxi.
And he was there, too.	Eye eya hã nɔ anyi.
Help me out, please.	Kpe ɖe ŋunye.
He was interested in everything.	Etsɔ ɖe le nusianu me.
Everything was fine until last week.	Nusianu nyo vaseɖe kwasiɖa si va yi me.
I think something about it doesn’t look right.	Mesusu be nane si le eŋu la medze nyuie o.
It’s a bad idea.	Enye susu gbegblẽ aɖe.
A lot of things happened.	Nu geɖe dzɔ.
He didn’t last long in that either.	Menɔ anyi eteƒe didi le ema hã me o.
Show respect to everyone.	Ðe bubu fia amesiame.
Use a light hand.	Zã asi si me kɔ.
He is not a good person.	Menye ame nyui aɖeke o.
If only he could come over.	Ne ɖe wòate ŋu ava ɖe afima ko la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
They have no children together .	Vi aɖeke mele wo si ɖekae o .
We can only go to one place.	Teƒe ɖeka koe míate ŋu ayi.
We hope you enjoyed it.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be edzɔ dzi na wò.
He can do this.	Ate ŋu awɔ esia.
It doesn’t matter now anyway.	Mehiã fifia le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
The car is speeding down the highway.	Ʋua le du dzi le mɔ gã la dzi.
There is no alcohol in this drink.	Aha aɖeke mele aha sia me o.
This is a mistake.	Esia nye vodada.
I was nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe.
A lot of things have changed.	Nu geɖe trɔ.
You are great.	Ènye gã.
There is nothing rooted about it.	Naneke meli ke le eŋu o.
I did it that way.	Mewɔe nenema.
I still don’t understand it.	Nyemese egɔme haɖe o.
Everyone needs money these days.	Amesiame hiã ga le ŋkeke siawo me.
Sprinkle lightly with salt.	Tsɔ dze ƒu gbe ɖe edzi vie.
It looks like it used to.	Edze abe tsã ene.
The one person.	Ame ɖeka la.
This can be a bad thing.	Esia ate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ.
He never stood up for himself.	Metsi tre ɖe eɖokui ŋu kpɔ o.
There is no water in this tube.	Tsi aɖeke mele mɔ̃ sia me o.
But stick with me here.	Gake lé ɖe ŋunye le afisia.
Two cars were badly damaged.	Ʋu eve gblẽ vevie.

Few of them returned.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe trɔ gbɔ.
But last year it didn’t work out.	Gake le ƒe si va yi me la, mewɔ dɔ o.
He had no role to play.	Akpa aɖeke menɔ esi o.

He made a big mistake.	Ewɔ vodada gã aɖe.
There was a problem.	Kuxi aɖe nɔ anyi.
Something like this must have happened.	Nane si le abe esia ene anya dzɔ.
He had two characteristics.	Nɔnɔme eve nɔ esi.
It wouldn’t bother me at all.	Maɖe fu nam kura o.
If you can do it.	Ne àte ŋui la.
Tell me what for you.	Gblɔ nusi na wò.
Do everything in his name.	Wɔ nusianu le eƒe ŋkɔ me.
Clearly, things have changed.	Edze ƒã be nuwo trɔ.
Get involved with it.	Wɔ ɖeka kplii.
I’ve never seen that place before.	Nyemekpɔ teƒe ma kpɔ o.

Maybe he doesn’t have to do anything.	Ðewohĩ mehiã be wòawɔ naneke o.
Some will give a little.	Ame aɖewo ana nu vi aɖe.
And you’re in it, too.	Eye wò hã nèle eme.
Things will get better next week.	Nuwo anyo ɖe edzi le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me.
There is no one.	Ame aɖeke meli o.
And maybe we can.	Eye ɖewohĩ míate ŋui.
That’s the truth.	Emae nye nyateƒe.
Part of it is time.	Eƒe akpa aɖee nye ɣeyiɣi.
One man	Ŋutsu ɖeka .
I still like everything.	Nusianu gakpɔtɔ dzɔa dzi nam kokoko.
I don’t see anything wrong with it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si gblẽ le eŋu o.
Maybe it was a mistake.	Ðewohĩ vodada aɖee wònye.
But there was clearly someone in the house.	Gake edze ƒã be ame aɖe nɔ aƒea me.
You are probably one of them.	Anɔ eme be ènye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
But we have an idea.	Gake susu aɖe le mía si.
I just wanted to try if anything would come of it.	Ðeko medi be mate kpɔ ne nane ado tso eme.
Yet he couldn’t.	Ke hã mete ŋui o.
Not like any of it matters.	Menye abe alesi wo dometɔ aɖeke le vevie ene o.
He could own this as a mistake he shouldn't have made.	Ate ŋu anye esia tɔ abe vodada si mele be wòawɔ hafi o ene.
Time to book it from here.	Ɣeyiɣi si woawɔ agbalẽ ɖe edzi tso afisia.
Stop right here.	Dzudzɔ le afisia tututu.
Kind of another name, you know.	Ŋkɔ bubu ƒomevi aɖe, ènya.
This coming year will see a lot of new features.	Ƒe sia si gbɔna la akpɔ nu yeye geɖe.
Look at all that blood!	Kpɔ ʋu ma katã ɖa!
Do as the great king commands.	Wɔ abe ale si fia gã la de se ene.
It could easily be me.	Ate ŋu anye nye hã bɔbɔe.

Or yourself.	Alo wò ŋutɔ.
No one can know.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu anya o.
We may not do this.	Ðewohĩ míawɔ esia o.

It would never have passed.	Anye ne mava yi gbeɖe o.

Those about him said little to him.	Ame siwo ku ɖe eŋu la megblɔ nya boo aɖeke nɛ o.
Check out the project.	Kpɔ dɔa ɖa.
It’s clearly the case.	Eme kɔ ƒã.
But he can’t see.	Gake mete ŋu kpɔa nu o.
I don’t have to go anywhere.	Mehiã be mayi afi aɖeke o.
It’s not a thing.	Menye nu aɖeke o.
Yet he didn’t do that.	Ke hã mewɔe nenema o.
He didn’t seem to mind.	Edze abe meɖe fu nɛ o ene.
Please focus on the more important things.	Taflatse lé ŋku ɖe nu siwo le vevie wu ŋu.
They are fighting for what is right.	Wole avu wɔm ɖe nu si le eteƒe ta.
This seemed strange to me.	Esia dze nam be ewɔ nuku nam.
This is a great opportunity.	Esia nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe.
He is speaking better.	Ele nu ƒom nyuie wu.
I understand that this existed.	Mese egɔme be esia nɔ anyi.

He has to do his part.	Ele be wòawɔ eƒe akpa dzi.
It was his first real job.	Enye eƒe dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ gbãtɔ.
It’s not just here.	Menye afisia koe wòle o.

And we can talk about that a little bit.	Eye míate ŋu aƒo nu tso ema ŋu vie.
Or maybe before it.	Alo ɖewohĩ do ŋgɔ nɛ.
He contributed a lot.	Edzɔ nu geɖe.

His name still lives on.	Eƒe ŋkɔ gakpɔtɔ le agbe.
What are they in order?.	Nukae wole ɖe ɖoɖo nu?.
It’s a difficult thing.	Nu sesẽ aɖee.
Stay behind here.	Tsi megbe le afisia.
It really impressed me.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t see a problem with it.	Nyemekpɔ kuxi aɖeke le eŋu o.

The police are there now.	Kpovitɔwo le afima fifia.
But it didn’t bother him.	Gake meɖe fu nɛ o.
But one person was not there.	Gake ame ɖeka ya menɔ afima o.
Everyone was asking questions about it.	Amesiame nɔ nya biam le eŋu.
He was a strong man.	Enye ame sesẽ aɖe.
But I really enjoyed it.	Gake edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I hope people can relate with it .	Mele mɔ kpɔm be amewo ate ŋu ase egɔme kplii .

Little surprise, that.	Mewɔ nuku boo aɖeke o, be.
Some of these devices are a bit expensive.	Mɔ̃ siawo dometɔ aɖewo xɔ asi vie.
He wasn’t worried.	Metsi dzi o.
Four of them died.	Wo dometɔ ene ku.
The first to give up is lost.	Gbãtɔ si ana ta la bu.
Ask whatever you want.	Bia nusianu si nèdi.
Go further in the meantime.	Yi ŋgɔ wu le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
He'd never seen anything like it, either.	Mekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o, eya hã.
It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
Everyone was worried about them.	Amesiame tsi dzi ɖe wo ŋu.
But let me tell you this.	Gake mina magblɔ nya sia na mi.
This person died a long time ago.	Ame sia ku ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
I was fighting through it.	Menɔ avu wɔm to eme.
It really isn’t that complicated.	Le nyateƒe me la, menye nusi me kɔ nenema gbegbe o.
I can’t do that.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema o.
He worked so hard.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe ale gbegbe.
It is very important that you follow these rules.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ be nàwɔ ɖe se siawo dzi.
However, it is not that easy.	Ke hã, mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
Not often, anyway.	Menye zi geɖe o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Change a word or two.	Trɔ nya ɖeka alo eve.
But still this is pretty good.	Gake esia kokoko esia nyo ŋutɔ.
Stop wasting time!	Dzudzɔ ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ!
They will have our due respect.	Míaƒe bubu si dze la anɔ wo ŋu.
However, this doesn’t have to be the case.	Ke hã, mehiã be esia nanɔ nenema o.
It’s a no-brainer.	Enye nusi me susu mele o.
That’s what’s going on.	Emae nye nusi le edzi yim.
It was a waste of time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
I just want to see what happens.	Ðeko medi be makpɔ nusi adzɔ.
I thought it was nihilistic.	Mesusu be enye nusi me naneke mele o.
Let him do his job.	Na wòawɔ eƒe dɔ.
You can at least talk to him.	Àte ŋu aƒo nu kplii ya teti.
If anything, you.	Ne nane nɔ anyi la, wò.
I'll do it for you, somehow.	Mawɔe na wò, le mɔ aɖe nu.
Everything was excellent.	Nusianu nyo ŋutɔ.
It’s an idea but not the only one.	Enye susu aɖe gake menye eya ɖeka koe o.
He made himself that way.	Ewɔ eɖokui nenema.

The meeting was very hot and crowded.	Kpekpea xɔ dzo ŋutɔ eye amewo sɔ gbɔ ɖe eme.

It’s a school system.	Enye suku ƒe ɖoɖo aɖe.
He has a different, more mature voice.	Gbe si to vovo, si tsi wu la le esi.
You know it’s impossible.	Ènya be manya wɔ o.
This is a really interesting case.	Esia nye nya aɖe si do dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This guy just did something about it.	Ðeko ŋutsu sia wɔ nane ɖe eŋu.
I would love to be wrong about that though!.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔ vodada le nya ma ŋu ke hã!.
I can’t live with myself.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe kple ɖokuinye o.
I congratulate you.	Medo dzidzɔ na wò.
I really enjoy that.	Ema dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
But it's like.	Gake ele abe.
Some people are well aware of it.	Ame aɖewo nya nu tso eŋu nyuie.
The right people probably need to do that.	Anɔ eme be ehiã be ame siwo sɔ la nawɔ ema.
To him, you are not beautiful.	Le eya gbɔ la, mènya kpɔ o.
I am very angry now.	Medo dziku vevie fifia.
It will be worked out soon.	Woawɔ dɔ tso eŋu kpuie.
It’s a new era now.	Ɣeyiɣi yeye aɖee nye esia fifia.
Perhaps because of this.	Ðewohĩ le esia ta.
Something is definitely wrong with him.	Nane gblẽ le eŋu godoo.
This is a difficult problem.	Esia nye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
No man deserves that.	Ŋutsu aɖeke medze nenema o.
I remember hearing this.	Meɖo ŋku edzi be mese nya sia.
He has to be focused.	Ele be eƒe susu nanɔ nu ŋu.
But yet, it somehow seems smaller.	Gake ke hã, edze abe ɖe wòle sue wu le mɔ aɖe nu ene.
He may not be with us anymore.	Ðewohĩ megale mía gbɔ hã o.
It’s really clear.	Eme kɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He can do anything.	Ate ŋu awɔ nusianu.
It was a wonderful time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
There’s a lot here that doesn’t make sense.	Nu geɖe le afisia si me susu mele o.
If you were, it wouldn’t be.	Ne ɖe nènye la, anye ne manɔ nenema o.
They had no faces.	Mo aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
Everything went to plan.	Nusianu yi ɖe ɖoɖo nu.
And maybe it could happen.	Eye ɖewohĩ ate ŋu adzɔ hã.
Only a fraction of people did.	Amewo ƒe akpa sue aɖe koe wɔe nenema.
I just didn’t hear them.	Ðeko nyemese wo o.
It is a law.	Enye se aɖe.
Some names come to mind.	Ŋkɔ aɖewo nɔa susu me.
We don’t know about tomorrow.	Míenya nu tso etsɔ ŋu o.
But it won’t come.	Gake mava o.
At least for the time being.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia ya teti me.
It doesn’t seem necessary.	Edze abe mehiã o ene.
Actually, I am not.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemele nenema o.
You seem to know a lot about them.	Edze abe ènya nu geɖe tso wo ŋu ene.
Please contact me at.	Taflatse ƒo ka nam le.
Nothing will ever happen.	Naneke mava eme gbeɖe o.
But no one does this.	Gake ame aɖeke mewɔa esia o.
Right.	Nyui.
It’s just there for me.	Ðeko wòle afima nam.
Reach out to someone else in need.	Do asi ɖe ame bubu si hiã tu gbɔ.
People gave us some good feedback there, too.	Amewo tsɔ nya nyui aɖewo na mí le afima, hã.
You could do something like this.	Àte ŋu awɔ nane si le abe esia ene.
I was actually pretty nervous about this whole process.	Le nyateƒe me la, metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ ɖe ɖoɖo sia katã ŋu.
I am trying to find them.	Mele agbagba dzem be madi wo.
Life.	Agbe.
There was no death.	Ku aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
It makes sense.	Susu le eme.
I will put up with that.	Mado dzi le nya ma me.
One would have said he was surprised.	Ame aɖe hã agblɔ be ewɔ nuku nɛ hafi.
Use them if you have time for them.	Zã wo ne ɣeyiɣi le asiwò na wo.
And it won’t do anything.	Eye mawɔ naneke o.
It was a bad month.	Ɣleti gbegblẽ aɖee wònye.
He wasn’t the only one.	Menye eya ɖeka koe o.
There is no work for you there.	Dɔ aɖeke meli na wò le afima o.
And another one is missing.	Eye bubu aɖe hã bu.
There is another one of us.	Mía dometɔ bubu aɖe hã li.
This was going to be a long night.	Esia ava nye zã didi aɖe.
I am just a man.	Ŋutsu aɖe koe menye.
The whole house is dirty.	Aƒe bliboa ƒo ɖi.
I had some other strategies in mind.	Aɖaŋu bubu aɖewo nɔ susu me nam.
Now, come inside.	Azɔ, do va ge ɖe eme.
Yet he seems to have been here before.	Ke hã edze abe ɖe wònɔ afisia do ŋgɔ ene.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
He will listen to you.	Aɖo to wò.
I know that it is.	Menya be ele nenema.
That’s right there.	Ema le afima tututu.

There is no reason to rush.	Susu aɖeke meli si tae wòle be míawɔ kaba o.
I was fine.	Menɔ nyuie.
But I heard a lot.	Gake mese nu geɖe.
The car is still what it is.	Ʋua gakpɔtɔ nye nusi wòle.
We don’t know what happened to them.	Míenya nusi va dzɔ ɖe wo dzi o.
They are all going to die.	Wo katã wole kuku ge.
What happened to them? 	Nu kae dzɔ ɖe wo dzi?
It’s not because of him.	Menye eya tae o.
But it was seriously surprising.	Gake ewɔ nuku vevie.
It doesn’t matter much.	Mele vevie boo aɖeke o.
We know how important water is to life.	Míenya ale si tsi le vevie na agbe.
I already felt sick.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be medze dɔ xoxo.
In fact, in this case.	Le nyateƒe me la, le go sia me.
From there you can see everything.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusianu tso afima.
I am asking you for something.	Mele nane biam tso asiwò.
But it was a house.	Gake aƒe aɖee.
I’m here to talk to you.	Meva afisia be maƒo nu kpli wò.
It wasn’t that I couldn’t work.	Menye ɖe nyemete ŋu nɔ dɔ wɔm o.
This is just a busy job anyway.	Dɔ si me vovo mele o koe esia nye le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
In my town.	Le nye du me.
That’s totally right.	Ema sɔ kura.
That struck him as a little strange.	Ema wɔ nuku nɛ abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku vie ene.
You think you’ll like this.	Èsusu be esia adzɔ dzi na ye.
But you will need to do some work.	Gake ahiã be nàwɔ dɔ aɖewo.
It started about a year ago.	Edze egɔme anɔ abe ƒe ɖeka enye sia ene.
Everyone gets a role.	Amesiame xɔa akpa ɖeka.
No wonder he doesn’t want to go up here.	Mewɔ nuku o be medi be yeayi dzi le afisia o.
I’ve worked with him before.	Mewɔ dɔ kplii kpɔ.
Now  .	Fifia .
Shoot the fire.	Tu dzo.
I’ve found it.	Meke ɖe eŋu.
It’s not expensive.	Mexɔ asi o.
But that didn’t bother him.	Gake ema meɖe fu nɛ o.
It just won’t do it.	Ðeko mawɔe o.
We had a warm car.	Ʋu si me dzo le nɔ mía si.
Look, maybe it is.	Kpɔ ɖa, ɖewohĩ ele alea.
In one summer, it can’t be that way.	Le dzomeŋɔli ɖeka me la, mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
That’s what I’m talking about.	Emae nye nye nya.
As a result, he fell in love with her.	Esia wɔe be eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
It looks really good.	Edze nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t know what the thing is.	Nyemenya nusi nu la nye o.
These devices can also be very expensive.	Mɔ̃ siawo ate ŋu axɔ asi ŋutɔ hã.
I don't see what happened to them.	Nyemekpɔ nusi va dzɔ ɖe wo dzi o.
An idea formed in my mind.	Susu aɖe va dzɔ le nye susu me.
Clearly, this is nothing new.	Edze ƒã be esia menye nu yeye o.
It’s not a complicated hard case.	Menye nya sesẽ sesẽ aɖee wònye o.
I would love it if someone could explain.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ne ame aɖe ate ŋu aɖe eme.
Everyone was very very supportive.	Amesiame kpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
You can find this place.	Àte ŋu akpɔ teƒe sia.
I'm trying to make something beautiful.	Mele agbagba dzem be mawɔ nane si nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
For the same reason.	Le susu ma ke ta.
I hope you are doing well.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be èle edzi dzem nyuie.
Which is really good for me.	Nusi nyo nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It was a great car.	Ʋu gã aɖee.
And there’s nothing to it.	Eye naneke mele eŋu o.
He must have had an eye.	Anɔ eme be ŋku nɔ eŋu.
Buy this book.	Ƒle agbalẽ sia.
I believed in myself more.	Mexɔ ɖokuinye dzi se wu.
I miss you so much.	Mesusu wò ŋutɔ.
But this situation went beyond me.	Gake nɔnɔme sia yi ŋgɔ nam.
I'll do pretty well, now.	Mawɔe nyuie ŋutɔ, fifia.
He wasn’t there.	Menɔ afima o.
It’s a very popular thing.	Enye nusi xɔ ŋkɔ ŋutɔ.
In fact, he knows nothing.	Le nyateƒe me la, menya naneke o.
In everything the whole.	Le nusianu me la katã.
Why he was talking, he didn’t know.	Nusita wònɔ nu ƒom la, menya o.
I would like your opinion.	Madi be nàgblɔ wò susu.
Maybe it was just something that would happen to me every four years.	Ðewohĩ nane si adzɔ ɖe dzinye ƒe ene ɖesiaɖe koe wònye.
I said get inside.	Megblɔ be ge ɖe eme.
I can’t tell you anything.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke na wò o.
The night is out.	Zã do.
I could have gone on living a happy life.	Anye ne mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ agbe si me dzidzɔ le hafi.
This can happen in many ways.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ le mɔ geɖe nu.
Get on with your own project.	Yi wò ŋutɔ wò dɔa dzi.
But not in this way.	Gake menye le mɔ sia nu o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I think you are, too.	Mesusu be wò hã nèle nenema.
There has to be a better way.	Ele be mɔ si nyo wu nanɔ anyi.
Tell him whatever you need to tell him.	Gblɔ nya sia nya si wòle be nàgblɔ nɛ.
And nothing came of it.	Eye naneke meva o.
He didn’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke menɔ esi o.
There are some simple things we can do.	Nu bɔbɔe aɖewo li siwo míate ŋu awɔ.
I could be somewhere else tonight.	Mate ŋu anɔ teƒe bubu le zã sia me.
I think he's doing a pretty good job.	Mesusu be ele dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ wɔm.
He should be here too.	Ele be eya hã nanɔ afisia.
In fact, quite the opposite seems to be the case.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze abe nusi to vovo kura na emae le alea ene.
Kind of like you.	Ƒomevi aɖe abe wò ene.
Use "you" when we're talking about someone else.	Zã "wò" ne míele nu ƒom tso ame bubu ŋu.
Two thousand dead.	Ame kuku akpe eve.
But the money didn’t matter.	Gake ga la menɔ vevie o.
I will be right there.	Manɔ eteƒe.
But he had to do so much.	Gake ele nɛ be wòawɔ nu ma gbegbe.
We can’t afford to have any mistakes.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ga be vodada aɖeke nanɔ mía ŋu o.
Imagine if that was never necessary.	Bu eŋu kpɔ nenye be ema mehiã gbeɖe o.
I was just there.	Ðeko menɔ afima.
That's good for me.	Ema nyo nam.
It’s nothing more than that.	Menye naneke wu ema o.
It’s just too true.	Ðeko wònye nyateƒe akpa.
I have nothing to say to him, nothing like it.	Nya aɖeke mele asinye magblɔ nɛ o, naneke meli si sɔ kplii o.
But today is not a good day.	Gake egbea menye ŋkeke nyui aɖeke o.
The house is old but in order.	Aƒea do xoxo gake le ɖoɖo nu.
I can’t help but live with it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke wu be manɔ agbe kplii o.
There was just too much money in it.	Ðeko ga sɔ gbɔ akpa nɔ eme.
There are some serious ear problems going on right now.	To ƒe kuxi gã aɖewo le edzi yim fifia.
Here’s the interesting thing.	Nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame enye esia.
Nothing is too small.	Naneke mele sue akpa o.
Today, we know more.	Egbea la, míenya nu geɖe wu.
He couldn’t get there on his own.	Mete ŋu ɖo afima le eɖokui si o.
We got the following result.	Nusi gbɔna la do tso eme na mí.
That wasn’t me.	Menye nyee nye ema o.
He will be home in a week.	Anɔ aƒeme le kwasiɖa ɖeka megbe.
And that’s not because it’s easy.	Eye menye esi wòle bɔbɔe tae wòle nenema ɖo o.
Not in my name!.	Menye le nye ŋkɔ me o!.
I am the same actually.	Nye hã mele nenema ke le nyateƒe me.
Finally, it was me.	Mlɔeba la, nyee.
There was one small problem.	Kuxi sue ɖeka aɖe nɔ anyi.
Some people work well.	Ame aɖewo wɔa dɔ nyuie.
I did that myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mewɔe nenema.
He, didn’t say anything.	Eya, megblɔ naneke o.
No one can say anything to any of us.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke na mía dometɔ aɖeke o.
For weeks he did nothing.	Kwasiɖa aɖewo la, mewɔ naneke o.
Today has you in it.	Egbea na wò le eme.
That is absolutely true.	Nya ma nye nyateƒe kura.
Please contact us here.	Taflatse te ɖe mía ŋu le afisia.
There’s a lot of work to be done with putting everything back together.	Dɔ geɖe li woawɔ le nusianu ɖoɖo ɖe megbe ŋu.
No one can do it.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔe o.
I could be that guy.	Mate ŋu anye ŋutsu ma.

Blood is rushing to my face.	Ʋu le du dzi va ɖo nye mo.

There is nothing we can do about it.	Naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu o.
Two of them are very important.	Wo dometɔ eve le vevie ŋutɔ.
The lake got warmer.	Ta la xɔ dzo ɖe edzi.
I think a lot of people do.	Mesusu be ame geɖe wɔa esia.
Also, smoke there.	Azɔ hã, dzudzɔ le afima.

It's too much ado about not much.	Enye ado si gbɔ eme akpa le menye nu geɖe o ŋu.
I could kind of understand it.	Mete ŋu se egɔme le mɔ aɖe nu.
Maybe more time.	Ðewohĩ ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu.
Money is not important to me.	Ga mele vevie nam o.
I could see so much.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu nenema gbegbe.
I still have two things to do.	Nu eve aɖewo gakpɔtɔ li mawɔ.
This worked just fine on another device.	Esia wɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ le mɔ̃ bubu dzi.
Spend time wisely, do one thing at a time.	Zã ɣeyiɣi nyuie, wɔ nu ɖeka ɖeka.
But it has happened before.	Gake edzɔ kpɔ do ŋgɔ.
He never had a place in mind.	Teƒe aɖeke menɔ susu me nɛ kpɔ o.
Try this out.	Te esia kpɔ.
I can’t see them.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wo o.
I was really nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t trust him, or her.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o, alo eya dzi o.
I had to be the one.	Ele be nyee manɔ anyi.
There will probably be many of them.	Anɔ eme be wo dometɔ geɖe anɔ anyi.

This is really true.	Esia nye nyateƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I wasn’t in charge of them.	Menye nyee nɔ wo dzi kpɔm o.
Hold on to it.	Lé edzi ɖe asi.
For that matter, it seems to me as well.	Le nya ma ta la, edze nam hã nenema.

Now everyone had a job to do.	Fifia dɔ aɖe nɔ amesiame si wòawɔ.
People have seen them.	Amewo kpɔ wo kpɔ.

I know what that looks like.	Menya alesi ema le.
I am the only one.	Nyee nye ɖeka.
How many people are here?	Ame nenie le afisia?
It was a mistake.	Vodada aɖee wònye.
But he had little joy in it.	Gake dzidzɔ boo aɖeke menɔ esi le eŋu o.
The other was shorter, just a kid.	Bubu la nɔ kpuie wu, ɖevi koe wònye.
It could have been my imagination.	Ate ŋu anye nye susu me nuwo hafi.
People are asking about that.	Amewo le nya biam tso nya ma ŋu.
Our house faces the lake.	Míaƒe aƒea dze ŋgɔ ta la.
But it’s part of what defines me.	Gake enye nusi ɖe nye gɔme la ƒe akpa aɖe.
He also had a lot of things of his own.	Nu geɖe hã nɔ eya ŋutɔ si.
What happened in the past.	Nusi dzɔ va yi.
You can’t have them all.	Màte ŋu akpɔ wo katã o.
He can work with these people.	Ate ŋu awɔ dɔ kple ame siawo.
Write a comment in it.	Ŋlɔ nya aɖe ɖe eme.
This horse is faster than that one.	Sɔ sia le du dzi wu ɖeka ma.
You only have one gun.	Tu ɖeka koe le asiwò.
Like it was a dog.	Abe avu aɖee wònye ene.
Everyone can do simple and complicated.	Amesiame ate ŋu awɔ nu bɔbɔe si me kɔ.
I hope they have a different plan.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ɖoɖo bubu aɖe le wo si.
And in the meantime.	Eye le ɣeyiɣi ma me la,.
That’s why we have a job.	Esia tae dɔ le mía si ɖo.
Look at me!	Kpɔm ɖa!
All of them.	Wo katã.
But not like you.	Gake menye abe wò ene o.
It’s not beautiful.	Menya kpɔ o.
There wasn’t much for us to do anyway.	Nu geɖe menɔ anyi na mí be míawɔ le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
He doesn’t know what we’re missing.	Menya nusi bu na mí o.
But there is no one there.	Gake ame aɖeke mele afima o.
The whole thing.	Nu bliboa katã.
I found a couple of ways.	Mekpɔ mɔ eve aɖewo.
I just want this in my mouth right now.	Ðeko medi be esia nanɔ nye nu me fifia.
I talked to him.	Meɖo dze kplii.
After that, head back.	Le ema megbe la, trɔ ta ɖe megbe.
I know there must be some who understand.	Menya be ele be ame aɖewo nanɔ anyi siwo ase egɔme.
The people are in a difficult situation.	Amewo ƒe nɔnɔme sesẽ.
It wasn’t in it.	Menɔ eme o.
He will take us away.	Aɖe mí ɖa.
But maybe that’s a good point.	Gake ɖewohĩ nya nyui aɖee nye ema.
At a reasonable price.	Le asi si sɔ nu.
Why it is so important.	Nusita wòle vevie nenema gbegbe ɖo.
That requires two things.	Ema bia nu eve.
They are all in one place.	Wo katã le teƒe ɖeka.
There were very few places.	Teƒe ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ anyi.
You are in the same place.	Èle teƒe ɖeka.
I have done so many things.	Mewɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ kpɔ.

There is no problem at all.	Kuxi aɖeke kura mele eme o.
I held out my hand.	Medo nye asi ɖa.
I had a lot of fun today.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ geɖe egbea.
There is no place for this.	Teƒe aɖeke meli na esia o.
Inside, his mind was racing.	Le eme la, eƒe susu nɔ du dzi.
It was very pleasant to him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I'm going to work.	Mele dɔ wɔ ge.
I had respect for myself.	Bubu nɔ ŋunye.
It’s just who you are.	Ame si nènye koe wònye.
No one can doubt them.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu ake ɖi wo o.
Must.	Dze be.
There should be a law against this.	Ele be se aɖe nanɔ anyi si tsi tre ɖe esia ŋu.
So much could have happened in that time.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ ate ŋu adzɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma me hafi.
In my lifetime.	Le nye agbe me.
But this didn’t work this time.	Gake esia mewɔ dɔ zi sia o.
We can’t get there fast enough.	Míate ŋu aɖo afima kaba o.
It’s a good idea if it works.	Enye susu nyui aɖe ne ewɔ dɔ.
Come on, build a house.	Va, tu aƒe aɖe.
This so briefly.	Esia kpuie alea gbegbe.
The big day.	Ŋkeke gã la.
It happened quite a few times.	Edzɔ zi ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ.
Think about your job.	Bu wò dɔa ŋu kpɔ.
And yet again again.	Eye ake hã ake.
None of these things worked.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ dɔ o.
Life is a dead thing.	Agbe nye nusi ku.
Probably long before now.	Anɔ eme be ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe do ŋgɔ na fifia.
Ask someone who has helped you in another project.	Bia ame aɖe si kpe ɖe ŋuwò le dɔ bubu me.
Everyone thinks they know you.	Ame sia ame susui be yenya wò.
And there is still more work to be done.	Eye dɔ geɖe wu gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.
We can’t do this and we don’t have to.	Míate ŋu awɔ esia o eye mehiã hã o.
But there are some problems.	Gake kuxi aɖewo li.

Maybe he can find me something.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu adi nane nam.
Treat him that way.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu nenema.
You can’t do your job.	Màte ŋu awɔ wò dɔa o.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.

In my mind anyway.	Le nye susu me le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Perhaps you know some others.	Ðewohĩ ènya ame bubu aɖewo.

Thank you, thank you.	Akpe na wò, akpe na wò.
It’s been a long night.	Zã didi aɖee nye esia.
The small town has changed completely	Du sue la trɔ kura
I couldn’t recognize them.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ wo dze sii o.

It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
But this is something new.	Gake esia nye nu yeye aɖe.
What actually happened.	Nusi dzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s a matter of what works for you.	Enye nusi awɔ dɔ na wò ƒe nya.
They’re fine.	Wole nyuie.
Who has ever done it? 	Amekae wɔe kpɔ?
I think he can.	Mesusu be ate ŋui.
I don’t see a problem with it.	Nyemekpɔ kuxi aɖeke le eŋu o.
But in his mind, he didn’t.	Gake le eƒe susu me la, mewɔe nenema o.
There was some truth to this.	Nyateƒe aɖe nɔ nya sia me.
Tom wanted a new job.	Tom di dɔ yeye aɖe.
It was a great deal of fun.	Enye dzidzɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
It was a small pleasure for him.	Enye dzidzɔ sue aɖe nɛ.
I can’t work.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ dɔ o.
That is obviously not possible.	Edze ƒã be ema manya wɔ o.
The teacher is very thin.	Nufiala la ƒe lãme le sue ŋutɔ.
Money, by itself, is nothing but passive.	Ga, le eɖokui si, menye naneke wu nusi mewɔa dɔ o.
Its the last one.	Eƒe mamlɛtɔ.
I'm talking about really serious.	Mele nu ƒom tso vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋu.
That’s the problem with many guys like you.	Emae nye kuxi si le ŋutsu geɖe abe wò ene ŋu.
The problem with people has changed.	Kuxi si le amewo ŋu la trɔ.
He has four children.	Vi ene le esi.

As you wish.	Abe alesi nèdi ene.
One year we had a really nice guy.	Ƒe ɖeka la, ŋutsu aɖe si nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ la nɔ mía si.
To your surprise, everyone seems to have done that.	Ewɔ nuku na wò ŋutɔ be edze abe amesiame wɔe nenema ene.
It was a new day.	Enye ŋkeke yeye aɖe.
They must obey the law.	Ele be woawɔ ɖe se dzi.
There seems to be no problem with this.	Edze abe kuxi aɖeke mele esia ŋu o ene.
More and more detailed work is now being done.	Wole dɔ geɖe wu siwo me kɔ wu la wɔm fifia.
All these things went through my mind.	Nu siawo katã to nye susu me.
Thanks to him for doing this.	Akpe nɛ ɖe esia wɔwɔ ta.

For at least two.	Na eve ya teti.
I’m not feeling well.	Nyemele nyuie o.
They have a very small house.	Aƒe sue aɖe ŋutɔ le wo si.
A month later.	Ɣleti ɖeka megbe.

It’s a great situation.	Enye nɔnɔme gã aɖe.
However, few people work here.	Ke hã, ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe dɔ le afisia.
This is a drop of water.	Esia nye tsi si nye tsi sue aɖe.
Get the dog out.	Do avu la ɖa.
He set out for home.	Edze mɔ yi aƒeme.
Yet surprisingly or not, it’s a problem.	Ke hã ewɔ nuku alo mewɔ nuku o, enye kuxi.
Everyone knows everything.	Amesiame nya nu sia nu.
It’s almost like you’re actually there.	Ðeko wòle abe ɖe nèle afima ŋutɔŋutɔ ene kloe.
Your mind really doesn’t matter.	Le nyateƒe me la, wò susu mehiã o.
What is enough is enough.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ la sɔ gbɔ.
People are going to hate.	Amewo le fu lé ge.
There are more of us.	Mía dometɔ geɖe wu li.
Make him feel comfortable.	Na eƒe dzi dze eme.
This is good for me.	Esia nyo nam.

Everyone is happy.	Dzi dzɔa ame sia ame.
A room, which he had never lived in before.	Xɔ aɖe, si me menɔ kpɔ o.
This was a real treat for him.	Esia nye nuɖuɖu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe nɛ.
A lot of things really.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s not what we have today.	Menye emae le mía si egbea o.
The royal party arrived late.	Fia ƒe ha la va tsi megbe.
I want to tell you something.	Medi be magblɔ nane na mi.
Please, help us out.	Taflatse, kpe ɖe mía ŋu.
Like anyone can understand that.	Abe alesi ame aɖe ate ŋu ase ema gɔme ene.
It is a job for life.	Enye dɔ si woawɔ le agbe me.
Everything is up for grabs.	Nusianu le ŋgɔ na nusi woawɔ.
Do as you please.	Wɔ alesi nèdi.
Nice to see you.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mekpɔ wò.
One shot, one more.	Tu ɖeka, ame ɖeka wu.
I want to live in that house.	Medi be manɔ aƒe ma me.
I got a long drive home.	Mexɔ ʋu didi aɖe yi aƒeme.
What is your opinion on this?	Nukae nye wò susu le nya sia ŋu?
There was no fire.	Dzo menɔ anyi o.
But it doesn't seem to be working.	Gake edze abe mele dɔ wɔm o ene.
I know you are busy.	Menya be vovo mele ŋuwò o.
We don’t know what happened to them.	Míenya nu si dzɔ ɖe wo dzi o.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
And his tongue, too.	Eye eƒe aɖe hã.
There is no ship.	Meli o.
I just don’t want to do it.	Ðeko nyemedi be mawɔe o.
I cannot speak for everyone, though.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu ɖe ​​amesiame ta o ke hã.
Also personal character will not come out.	Azɔ hã ame ŋutɔ ƒe nɔnɔme mado go o.
He was obviously smart.	Edze ƒã be edze aɖaŋu.
Overall, a very good book.	Le nusianu me la, agbalẽ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
What did you do after school yesterday?	Nukae nèwɔ le suku megbe etsɔ?
One small pig went to market.	Ha sue ɖeka yi asi me.
But he wasn’t sure if he could do it.	Gake meka ɖe edzi nenye be yeate ŋu awɔe o.
Do what you have to do.	Wɔ nu si wòle be nàwɔ.
Nice to finally meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam be medo go wò mlɔeba.
I know where he might be.	Menya afisi wòate ŋu anɔ.
It didn’t surprise me.	Mewɔ nuku nam o.
It’s a perfect fit.	Enye nusi sɔ nyuie.
I'll be fine now.	Manɔ nyuie fifia.
This, he never did.	Esia, mewɔe kpɔ o.
But that didn’t make sense.	Gake susu menɔ nya ma me o.
He couldn't concentrate.	Mete ŋu tsɔ eƒe susu ɖo nu ŋu o.
Nice to meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò.
Looks like someone reported us.	Edze abe ame aɖe ka nya ta na mí ene.
And we’re fine.	Eye míele nyuie.
The important thing is to do the right thing.	Nu si le vevie enye be míawɔ nu nyuie.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anye nenema o.
This is not exactly true.	Esia menye nyateƒe tututu o.
Let me explain something that might help.	Na maɖe nane si ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò la me na wò.
And himself, of course.	Eye eya ŋutɔ hã, le nyateƒe me.
No surprise there.	Mewɔ nuku o le afima.
Nothing like it back home.	Naneke mele abe esia ene le aƒeme o.
Check this out.	Kpɔ esia ɖa.
I had such a hard time with it.	Mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe le eŋu ale gbegbe.
It is not a good idea, and it is not legal.	Menye susu nyuie wònye o, eye mele se nu hã o.
That’s just one word.	Nya ɖeka koe nye ema.
His mind was small and simple.	Eƒe susu nɔ sue eye wònɔ bɔbɔe.
Stop for nothing.	Dzudzɔ ɖe naneke ŋu o.
It’s been a while.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
I wanted to stay.	Medi be manɔ anyi.
That’s not me at these prices.	Menye nyee nye ema le asi siawo nu o.
But the opposite is quite surprising.	Gake nusi to vovo na emae nye nusi wɔ nuku kura.
It can happen.	Ate ŋu adzɔ.
I stood for something.	Metsi tre ɖe nane ta.
At that point, click once.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, zi edzi zi ɖeka.
Perhaps the only exception is very early.	Ðewohĩ nusi to vovo na ema koe nye kaba ŋutɔ.
Sprinkle with a pinch of salt.	Tsɔ dze sue aɖe ƒo ɖe eŋu.
On this day, one was not.	Le ŋkeke sia dzi la, ɖeka menɔ nenema o.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Everyone else certainly does.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã wɔa esia godoo.
Your life needs you.	Wò agbe hiã wò.
That didn’t please him.	Ema medze eŋu o.
Perhaps this is popular.	Ðewohĩ esia dzɔa dzi na amewo.
I just don’t know where to go from here.	Ðeko nyemenya afi si mayi tso afisia o.
A few things there surprised me.	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo le afima wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
He can’t take care of himself.	Mete ŋu kpɔa eɖokui dzi o.
It can happen.	Ate ŋu adzɔ.
I have been looking for something like this for a long time.	Mele nane si le abe esia ene dim ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I don’t have to do it.	Mehiã be mawɔe o.
He had never been fighting.	Menɔ avu wɔm kpɔ o.
That’s famous.	Ema xɔ ŋkɔ.
I can go anywhere.	Mate ŋu ayi afi sia afi.
I'll be fine.	Manɔ nyuie.
I haven’t been able to go there yet.	Nyemete ŋu yi afima haɖe o.
Which would be one here like that.	Nusi anye ɖeka le afisia nenema.
Maybe more than once.	Ðewohĩ wu zi ɖeka.
Who wrote this?	Amekae ŋlɔ nya sia?
This raises two possibilities.	Esia fɔ nu eve siwo ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe te.
That worried me.	Ema tsi dzi nam.
I don’t know when that is.	Nyemenya ɣekaɣie wòle nenema o.
Get out of the house.	Do go le aƒea me.
There is nothing I can do.	Naneke meli mawɔ o.
A horse fell on him.	Sɔ aɖe ge dze edzi.
A few of these cars are still in service.	Ʋu siawo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ le dɔ wɔm.
It’s very clear.	Eme kɔ nyuie.
That day was one of the most exhausting.	Gbe ma gbe nye ŋkeke siwo te ɖeɖi mía ŋu wu la dometɔ ɖeka.
There is a situation that never worked out.	Nɔnɔme aɖe li si mewɔ dɔ nyuie gbeɖe o.
Maybe it will make you more organized.	Ðewohĩ ana nàwɔ ɖoɖo nyuie wu.
But that’s enough for now.	Gake ema sɔ gbɔ na fifia.
I saw what he could do last night.	Mekpɔ nusi wòate ŋu awɔ le zã si va yi me.
And you can’t do anything.	Eye màte ŋu awɔ naneke o.
Know what time it is.	Nya ɣeyiɣi si wòle.
I am sure you are aware of this.	Meka ɖe edzi be ènya nu tso esia ŋu.
That is the first point.	Emae nye nya gbãtɔ.
There is real work to be done.	Dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ li woawɔ.
Not any of them.	Menye wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
I am parts of it.	Nyee nye akpa aɖewo.
I can see very clearly.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu nyuie ŋutɔ.
It was a long time ago.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si va yi.
No one got to know us.	Ame aɖeke meva nya mí o.
I’m so glad you liked it though.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be edzɔ dzi na wò ke hã.
All of this worked in a very good way.	Nu siawo katã wɔ dɔ le mɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nu.
Hold on a little bit.	Lé ɖe asi vie.
See what he did.	Kpɔ nusi wòwɔ ɖa.
About many things.	Ku ɖe nu geɖe ŋu.
I got hot the last time.	Mexɔ dzo zi mamlɛtɔ.
Exactly how it was.	Ale si tututu wònɔ.
To my surprise, he did not express any opinion.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ be megblɔ eƒe susu aɖeke o.
A lot had changed in his life, in his mind.	Nu geɖe trɔ le eƒe agbe me, le eƒe susu me.
Think of it this way.	Bu eŋu alea.
An opportunity will arise.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe ado mo ɖa.
I have never seen this car before.	Nyemekpɔ ʋu sia kpɔ o.
So  .	Eya ta .
It’s the only reality here.	Eya koe nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ le afisia.
This will be his room.	Esia anye eƒe xɔ.
This book is nothing new.	Agbalẽ sia menye nu yeye o.
Neither had been yet.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke hã menɔ nenema haɖe o.
I have to do it too.	Ele be nye hã mawɔe.
But something killed them.	Gake nane wu wo.
But it will be very expensive.	Gake axɔ ga geɖe ŋutɔ.
In another way.	Mɔ bubu aɖe dzi.
Or the car.	Alo ʋua.
My little part.	Nye akpa sue la.
But there is something else at work here as well.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã le dɔ wɔm le afisia hã.
I don’t quite understand that.	Nyemese nya ma gɔme tututu o.
This is a real thing.	Esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I can do this little thing for you.	Mate ŋu awɔ nu sue sia na wò.
I think it did me a favor.	Mesusu be ewɔ nu nyui aɖe nam.
What do you have to say about that?.	Nukae le asiwò nàgblɔ tso ema ŋu?.
This is another situation.	Esia hã nye nɔnɔme bubu.
And if this fight is long, he will definitely win.	Eye ne avu sia didi la, ke aɖu dzi godoo.
The time in which we live now.	Ɣeyiɣi si me míele fifia.
Stay on top of it.	Nɔ edzi.
It was a man.	Ŋutsu aɖee.
I doubt if it’s possible.	Meke ɖi nenye be anya wɔ.
But something was bothering me.	Gake nane nɔ fu ɖem nam.
Something a little strange about them.	Nane wɔ nuku vie le wo ŋu.
See here, and here, and here.	Kpɔ afisia, kple afisia, kple afisia.
So much so that you can’t.	Ale gbegbe be màte ŋui o.
It’s not a small task.	Menye dɔ sue aɖee o.
He's in that place where he can do that.	Ele teƒe ma si wòate ŋu awɔ ema le.
This problem is very important to me.	Kuxi sia le vevie nam ŋutɔ.
He was so very pleased.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ ale gbegbe.
But we knew exactly what was going on.	Gake míenya nusi tututu nɔ edzi yim.
If he can.	Ne ate ŋui la.
Tomorrow is a day.	Etsɔ nye ŋkeke aɖe.
The word came out.	Nya la do go.
The king spoke to himself.	Fia ƒo nu na eɖokui.
He had no idea what to do about it.	Mesusu nusi wòawɔ tso eŋu o.
Thank you, man.	Akpe na wò, ŋutsu.
No one is coming after us.	Ame aɖeke mele mía megbe gbɔna o.
It didn’t work very well.	Mewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ o.
That was a smoke.	Dzudzɔ aɖee nye ema.
And that’s good for me.	Eye esia nyo nam.
I can'.	Mate ŋu'.
But he didn’t do this.	Gake mewɔ esia ya o.
I’m so glad he’s here.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be ele afisia.
But my life is not worth your lost.	Gake nye agbe meɖe vi na wò tɔ si bu o.
There was little time left.	Ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe nɔ anyi.
I don’t understand this.	Nyemese nya sia gɔme o.
I promise it’s okay.	Medo ŋugbe be ele nyuie.
I did this.	Mewɔ esia.
Not that this is necessarily a bad thing.	Menye be esia nye nu gbegblẽ kokoko o.
Every major city has at least one market.	Asi ɖeka ya teti le du gã ɖesiaɖe me.
The result, we don’t know.	Nusi do tso eme la, míenya o.
It actually worked well.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
Not for anyone for any reason.	Menye na ame aɖeke le susu aɖeke ta o.
There are two reasons for doing so.	Susu eve aɖewo tae wòle be míawɔ nu ma ɖo.
I'm not so sure that's true.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe be nya ma nye nyateƒe o.
From the house.	Tso aƒea me.
You have to do this.	Ele be nàwɔ esia.
And many others that are smaller.	Eye bubu geɖe siwo le sue wu hã.
Or many of them.	Alo wo dometɔ geɖe.
Everyone gets to talk.	Amesiame kpɔa mɔ ƒoa nu.
And so did he.	Eye eya hã.
I am having trouble staying focused.	Mele kuxi me tom be nye susu nanɔ nu ŋu nyuie.
This is a completely new phenomenon.	Esia nye nu yeye kura.
Mine was a bit smaller.	Nye tɔ nɔ sue vie.
It's just that.	Ðeko wòle be...
But it wasn’t happening.	Gake menye ɖe wònɔ edzi yim o.
I want to get to know you better.	Medi be manya wò nyuie wu.
There is no house in the same room in my four ways.	Aƒe aɖeke mele xɔ ɖeka me le nye mɔ ene nu o.
There are always people in my house.	Amewo nɔa nye aƒe me ɣesiaɣi.
I often have that problem, too.	Zi geɖe la, kuxi ma nɔa ŋunye, nye hã.
I have an apartment now.	Xɔ aɖe le asinye fifia.
The most important thing.	Nu si le vevie wu.
Just tell me what you want.	Ðeko nàgblɔ nusi dim nèle nam.
That made him feel good.	Ema na eƒe dzi dze eme nyuie.
He had some other things.	Nu bubu aɖewo nɔ esi.
That’s why this is so important.	Esia tae esia le vevie ŋutɔ ɖo.
And for a good reason.	Eye susu nyui aɖe tae.
Maybe this matters a bit.	Ðewohĩ esia le vevie vie.
But face the truth.	Gake dze ŋgɔ nyateƒea.
He threw his sword forward.	Etsɔ eƒe yi ƒu gbe ɖe ŋgɔ.
I will definitely do it.	Mawɔe kokoko.
And nothing did that.	Eye naneke mewɔe nenema o.
I doubted it.	Meke ɖi le eŋu.
There are a lot of people in this town.	Ame siwo le du sia me la sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
I decided to give this a try.	Meɖoe be mate esia kpɔ.
This place is definitely.	Teƒe sia godoo.
You can’t handle them all.	Màte ŋu akpɔ wo katã gbɔ o.
The accumulated dust was blowing in the wind.	Ke si ƒo ƒu la nɔ ya ƒom.
The dog was very important.	Avu la nɔ vevie ŋutɔ.
You can still stay at my house.	Àte ŋu anɔ nye aƒeme kokoko.
I’m not happy yet.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ haɖe o.
I will find a new job.	Makpɔ dɔ yeye aɖe.
I have been waiting for a very long time.	Mele lalam ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
We are ready.	Míele klalo.
But at this point, no one was going anywhere.	Gake le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, ame aɖeke menɔ afi aɖeke yim o.
I told him exactly what happened.	Megblɔ nusi tututu dzɔ nɛ.
And it’s a bad thing.	Eye wònye nu gbegblẽ.
You know how this feels now.	Ènya alesi esia se le eɖokui me fifia.
No one had ever seen or heard anything.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ naneke kpɔ alo se naneke kpɔ o.
Someone else will do the same.	Ame bubu aɖe hã awɔe nenema.
At .	Le .
Nothing is going on.	Naneke mele edzi yim o.
It wouldn’t matter if the issues in question were actually true.	Maɖe vi ne nya siwo ŋu nya ku ɖo la nye nyateƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
That someone is right.	Be ame aɖe ƒe nya le eteƒe.
You can tell me the truth.	Àte ŋu agblɔ nyateƒea nam.
I can’t tell if it’s true.	Nyemate ŋu anya nenye be enye nyateƒe o.
I will be on it.	Manɔ edzi.
This works without a problem in my case.	Esia wɔa dɔ kuxi aɖeke manɔmee le nye nya la me.
Respect the law.	De bubu se la ŋu.
Finding a job.	Dɔ aɖe didi.
Now we are feeding them.	Fifia míele nuɖuɖu nam wo.
And when is it.	Eye ɣekaɣie.
The way the people there are.	Ale si ame siwo le afi ma la le.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I fell forward.	Medze anyi ɖe ŋgɔ.
Spend two hours in the sun.	Zã gaƒoƒo eve le ŋdɔ me.
Tell me how you like them.	Gblɔ alesi wo dzɔa dzi na wòe nam.
This is not a problem at all.	Esia menye kuxi kura o.
It was a pleasure to meet you.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò.
In fact, she had her own child.	Le nyateƒe me la, eya ŋutɔ ƒe vi nɔ esi.
They seem to be doing pretty well.	Edze abe wole edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔ ene.
I'll see what happens.	Makpɔ nusi adzɔ.
None of us wanted them.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke medi wo o.
They are moving forward in.	Wole ŋgɔ yim le.
It surprised me, too.	Ewɔ nuku nam hã.
My mind doesn’t work that way.	Nye susu mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
I don’t need to say that.	Mehiã be magblɔ nya ma o.
There will never be money for them.	Ga manɔ anyi na wo gbeɖe o.
Discard any that are damaged.	Tsɔ ɖesiaɖe si gblẽ la ƒu gbe.
It is true that.	Enye nyateƒe be.
But yet each is so clear.	Gake ke hã wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe me kɔ alea.
I can’t escape it.	Nyemate ŋu asi le eŋu o.
Want to do the same thing.	Di be yeawɔ nu ma ke.
I know nothing about your life.	Nyemenya naneke tso wò agbe ŋu o.
A few people supported this plan.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo da asi ɖe ɖoɖo sia dzi.
But something is wrong.	Gake nane gblẽ.
We cannot continue to live in the past.	Míate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ agbe le ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me o.
All things are possible in this moment.	Nuwo katã ate ŋu adzɔ le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
Everything is double.	Nusianu nye zi gbɔ zi eve.
But he never allowed that.	Gake meɖe mɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
He was always very focused.	Eƒe susu nɔa nu ŋu ŋutɔ ɣesiaɣi.
I was so angry with myself.	Medo dziku ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu ale gbegbe.
This is the opposite of the truth.	Esia to vovo na nyateƒea.
No one ever seems to be doing that.	Edze abe ame aɖeke mele nu ma wɔm gbeɖe o ene.
This is a very important point.	Nya sia le vevie ŋutɔ.
I’ve never felt that way before.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o.
Maybe he couldn’t stand it himself.	Ðewohĩ eya ŋutɔ mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
We don’t know what to do about it.	Míenya nusi míawɔ tso eŋu o.
On this very night.	Le zã sia tututu me.
There were a few people in it.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ eme.
That’s all they are, anyway.	Ema koe nye wo, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Know every man.	Nya ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe.
And it was a good night.	Eye zã nyui aɖee wònye.
I can do that, you know.	Mate ŋu awɔ ema, ènya.
They have nothing.	Naneke mele wo si o.
Think about things.	Bu nuwo ŋu kpɔ.
I'll talk to him shortly.	Maƒo nu kplii kpuie.

But it’s not you.	Gake menye wòe o.
Everyone was surprised.	Ewɔ nuku na amesiame.
I need to do a few projects.	Ele be mawɔ dɔ ʋɛ aɖewo.
A bad place.	Teƒe gbegblẽ aɖe.
But still he didn’t give up.	Gake ke hã meɖe asi le eŋu o.
The truth never really bothered me.	Nyateƒea meɖe fu nam ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
Think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ.
Give your full name.	Gblɔ wò ŋkɔ bliboa.
Someone might say something.	Ame aɖe ate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖe.
None of us can do it.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋui o.
This surprised us.	Esia wɔ nuku na mí.
And this has two consequences.	Eye esia do tso eme eve.
Clearly a problem.	Edze ƒã be kuxi aɖee.
Police have yet to make any arrests.	Kpovitɔwo mekpɔ lé ame aɖeke haɖe o.

I'll be there in the afternoon.	Mava le ŋdɔ me.
No one is eating.	Ame aɖeke mele nu ɖum o.
This was a shock to me.	Nu sia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
But it seems to be the case.	Gake edze abe ɖe wòle nenema ene.
It won’t do anyone any good, one way or the other.	Maɖe vi aɖeke na ame aɖeke o, le mɔ ɖeka alo bubu nu.
One thought began to haunt him.	Susu ɖeka aɖe va nɔ fu ɖem nɛ vevie.
This week and next.	Kwasiɖa sia kple esi gbɔna.
The possibility did not occur to him.	Nusi ate ŋu adzɔ la meva susu me nɛ o.
But I’m the one.	Gake nye ya.
I wasn’t sure what to do.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ dzi o.
This place is broken.	Teƒe sia gblẽ.
I felt encouraged.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be dzi ƒo.
But, for now, he can do no more.	Gake, fifia la, mate ŋu awɔ naneke wu ema o.
He seemed very fond of the house.	Edze abe aƒea ƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ ene.
Everyone knows the truth.	Ame ɖe sia ɖe nya nyateƒea.
I can share with you some of my thoughts.	Mate ŋu agblɔ nye susu aɖewo na mi.
Everyone is different.	Ame ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
We can just stay here.	Ðeko míate ŋu anɔ afisia.
Stay in the car.	Nɔ ʋua me.
A new one has begun.	Yeye aɖe dze egɔme.
I only felt the hand.	Asi la koe mese le ɖokuinye me.
But I must apologize for last week.	Gake ele be maɖe kuku ɖe kwasiɖa si va yi ta.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
I don’t want to do it.	Nyemedi be mawɔe o.
Seems like a good idea.	Edze abe susu nyui aɖee wònye ene.
Yet there was something about it.	Ke hã nane nɔ eŋu.
Throughout the house.	Le aƒea me katã.
I just can’t do it.	Ðeko nyemate ŋui o.
We need to have a passion.	Ele be dzo nanɔ mía si.
He slid his hand over the space between them.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ƒo ɖe teƒe si le wo dome la dzi.
But of course he never did.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
I am doing this on my part.	Mele esia wɔm le nye akpa dzi.
Some of them are as relevant today as they were in the past.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ le vevie egbea abe alesi wònɔ tsã ene.
I did the same thing as you.	Nye hã mewɔ nu ma ke abe wò ene.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Edze abe nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie ene.
Another is long gone.	Bubu hã va yi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
It may be true.	Ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
Everyone knows about you.	Amesiame nya nu tso ŋuwò.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
This sounds like non-money, not money.	Esia ɖi abe ga si menye ga o ene, ke menye ga o.
I got a little hot.	Mexɔ dzo vie.
All that matters is the potential child.	Nusi le vevie koe nye vi si ate ŋu ava.
But this is quite different.	Gake esia to vovo kura.
And something else.	Eye nu bubu aɖe hã.
He also never dressed properly.	Medo awu nyuie hã kpɔ o.
That never crossed my mind.	Ema meva susu me nam kpɔ o.
I did that for years.	Mewɔe nenema ƒe geɖe.
It seemed strange to me.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nam ene.
But he would have known them.	Gake anye ne anya wo hafi.
It was as if he was asking a question.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe wòle nya aɖe biam ene.
I have told you that myself.	Nye ŋutɔ megblɔ nya ma na mi.
But we have two things.	Gake nu eve aɖewo le mía si.
I was interested in them.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wo.
You know when.	Ènya ɣekaɣie.
None appeared more than twice.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke medze wu zi eve o.
We don’t have to do anything about it.	Mehiã be míawɔ naneke tso eŋu o.
Her apartment is so tidy.	Eƒe xɔa me le ɖoɖo nu ale gbegbe.
The wind changed several times.	Ya la trɔ zi geɖe.
Or was it that way.	Alo ɖe wònɔ nenema.
That’s for two people.	Ema na ame eve.
Let me tell you what I enjoyed.	Mina magblɔ nusi do dzidzɔ nam la na mi.
I hope you like it!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò!.
No smoke on these two, thankfully.	Dzudzɔ aɖeke mele ame eve siawo ŋu o, akpe be.
It made sense, of course.	Susu nɔ eme ya.
The project has two phases.	Dɔa ƒe akpa eve le eme.
In this case, however, two points are in order.	Gake le go sia me la, nya eve aɖewo le ɖoɖo nu.
None of us can remember his name.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi o.
He can’t or won’t.	Mate ŋui o alo mawɔe o.
Think of it as a shock.	Bu eŋu kpɔ be ewɔ nuku na ame.
Who he is.	Ame si wònye.
It seems to be the case.	Edze abe ɖe wòle nenema ene.
You don’t have to say anything.	Mehiã be nàgblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Over and over and over again.	Zi geɖe kple zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
Believe in me.	Xɔ dzinye se.
Something is wrong.	Nane gblẽ.
That can’t be good for his heart.	Ema mate ŋu anyo na eƒe dzi o.
Can you tell me what day works for you.	Àte ŋu agblɔ ŋkeke si awɔ dɔ na wò la nam.
One person can do it.	Ame ɖeka ate ŋui.
The congregation resisted.	Ha la tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
That’s about me.	Nya ma ku ɖe ŋunye.
I didn’t feel like I was doing that.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nyee nɔ nu ma wɔm o.
He just sat there.	Ðeko wònɔ anyi ɖe afima.
It’s not at all surprising.	Mewɔ nuku kura o.
That makes good sense.	Susu le nya ma me nyuie.
There must be more.	Ele be nu geɖe wu nanɔ anyi.
For a long time, too.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe hã.
I don’t want to be here.	Nyemedi be manɔ afisia o.
Almost everyone.	Amesiame kloe.
I don’t know anything else.	Nyemenya nu bubu aɖeke o.
I’m not giving you any money.	Nyemele ga aɖeke nam wò o.
But that seems too complicated.	Gake edze abe nya ma sesẽ akpa ene.
In some cases this is very true.	Le go aɖewo me la, esia nye nyateƒe ŋutɔ.
This has always been difficult for me.	Esia nye nu sesẽ nam ɣesiaɣi.
That’s entirely possible, and it’s a concern I have.	Ema anya wɔ kura, eye enye nya si ŋu metsi dzi ɖo.
He didn't care much.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme boo o.
He lost his job.	Dɔ ge le esi.
That will play a big role.	Ema awɔ akpa gã aɖe.
It never was and never will be.	Menɔ anyi kpɔ o eye manɔ nenema hã gbeɖe o.
He himself wasn’t sure.	Eya ŋutɔ meka ɖe edzi o.
True! 	Nyateƒe!
I remember him being here.	Meɖo ŋku edzi be ele afisia.
Your very life.	Wò agbe ŋutɔ.
I'm sure that	Meka ɖe edzi be
It was almost one in the morning.	Ŋdi ga ɖeka kloe ye nye ema.
Someone knows about the money.	Ame aɖe nya nu tso ga la ŋu.
The price of money has gone up.	Ga ƒe asi yi dzi ŋutɔ.
But we need to keep several things in mind.	Gake ele be nu geɖe nanɔ susu me na mí.
This isn’t a bad thing.	Esia menye nu gbegblẽ o.
The police entered the room.	Kpovitɔwo ge ɖe xɔa me.
It's just great.	Ðeko wòle gã ŋutɔ.
I know what it’s like.	Menya alesi wòle.
I have some things to try.	Nu aɖewo le asinye mate kpɔ.
Ask for a room in the back.	Bia xɔ aɖe le megbe.
Four of these characteristics overlap.	Nɔnɔme siawo dometɔ ene sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
How could that be?.	Aleke ema ate ŋu anɔ?.
Anger rose through him.	Dziku do ɖe edzi to eme.
However, that’s not all.	Ke hã, menye ema koe wònye o.
You can see them.	Àte ŋu akpɔ wo.
I certainly enjoyed that meal.	Nuɖuɖu ma do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ godoo.
The fire, running, fighting for its life.	Dzo la, le du dzi, le avu wɔm ɖe eƒe agbe ta.
We have to do that work.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ ma.
If only there were more people like him.	Ne ɖe ame geɖe nɔ anyi abe eya ene.
We don’t know you.	Míenya wò o.
Inside so loud that no one can talk to anyone else.	Le eme sesĩe ale gbegbe be ame aɖeke mate ŋu aƒo nu na ame bubu o.
For some reason, that wasn’t a good idea.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, ema menye susu nyui aɖeke o.
This can also work very well.	Esia hã ate ŋu awɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
He had some problems before.	Kuxi aɖewo nɔ eŋu do ŋgɔ.
I am not sure which one it is.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be kae wònye o.
It’s just the way it is for people.	Enye alesi wòle na amewo ko.
He never wanted to be like that.	Medi be yeanɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
We are enjoying ourselves.	Míele dzidzɔ kpɔm.
There was no smoke at all.	Dzudzɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi kura o.
Or is it the case.	Alo ɖe wòle nenema.
I couldn’t find anything better.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ naneke si nyo wu ema o.
But two things seem clear.	Gake edze abe nu eve aɖewo me kɔ ene.
So should you, too.	Nenema ke wòle be wò hã.
I am looking for a good place for us.	Mele teƒe nyui aɖe dim na mí.
His ears are small and deformed.	Eƒe to le sue eye eƒe nɔnɔme gblẽ.
Just a few small ways.	Mɔ sue aɖewo ko.
I don’t want to do it.	Nyemedi be mawɔe o.
I have to see you.	Ele be makpɔ wò.
It’s easy to get things done.	Ele bɔbɔe be woawɔ nuwo.
Some thought that was too much.	Ame aɖewo susui be ema sɔ gbɔ akpa.
I didn’t expect to be here in the morning.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be mava afisia le ŋdi me o.
He started off strong strong.	Edze mɔ sesĩe sesĩe.
Maybe we could go there a little more often.	Ðewohĩ míate ŋu ayi afima zi geɖe vie wu.
There was no meaning.	Egɔme aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
And that’s all there is to it.	Eye esia koe nye ema.
Find out what happened and where he is.	Kpɔ nusi dzɔ kple afisi wòle ɖa.
Everyone is interested in many things in life.	Amewo katã tsɔ ɖe le nu geɖe me le agbe me.
I only came once.	Zi ɖeka koe meva.
He didn’t answer.	Meɖo eŋu o.
I thought it was amazing.	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
One other point, too.	Nya bubu ɖeka hã.
There is only a small space.	Teƒe sue aɖe koe li.
But this is a brief exception.	Gake esia nye nusi to vovo kpuie.
I let go of his hand.	Meɖe asi le eƒe asi ŋu.
I know what reality looks like.	Menya alesi nu ŋutɔŋutɔ le.
I don’t know how to find anything.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ akpɔ naneke o.
No work is required.	Dɔ aɖeke mehiã o.
This road is in good shape.	Mɔ sia le nɔnɔme nyui me.
You can’t do that.	Màte ŋu awɔ ema o.
I’m not so sure about everything.	Nyemeka ɖe nusianu dzi nenema gbegbe o.
Spend your time on your skills that you enjoy the most.	Zã wò ɣeyiɣi ɖe wò aɖaŋu siwo doa dzidzɔ na wò wu ŋu.
If you have that, you have a lot.	Ne ema le asiwò la, nu geɖe le asiwò.
Open your hand.	Ʋu wò asi.
It will help us if we can keep things in order.	Akpe ɖe mía ŋu ne míate ŋu ana nuwo nanɔ nɔnɔme nyui me.
Those in charge misunderstood.	Ame siwo xɔ ŋgɔ wu la mese egɔme nyuie o.

He can eat.	Ate ŋu aɖu nu.
This is interesting for two reasons.	Esia doa dzidzɔ na ame le susu eve aɖewo ta.
You don’t have to do this.	Mehiã be nàwɔ esia o.
This is more true today than ever before.	Esia nye nyateƒe egbea wu tsã.
He was interested in her.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ.
It could have, but it didn’t.	Ate ŋu adzɔ hafi, gake mewɔe nenema o.
I saw something else.	Mekpɔ nu bubu aɖe.
I'll be here quite often myself and work.	Nye ŋutɔ mava nɔ afisia zi geɖe ŋutɔ eye mawɔ dɔ.
I think that would be a problem.	Mesusu be ema anye kuxi.
Invest in you.	De ga eme na wò.
Water is liquid.	Tsi nye tsi si me tsi le.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
My four more years.	Nye ƒe ene bubu.
Everyone knows this plan.	Amesiame nya ɖoɖo sia.
For now, things will remain as they are.	Fifia la, nuwo anɔ anyi abe alesi wole ene.
I don’t know his name.	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ o.
Now that would be a great name for this project.	Fifia ema anye ŋkɔ gã aɖe na dɔ sia.
I can’t speak anymore.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu azɔ o.
I can escape.	Mate ŋu asi.
However, he couldn’t back down now.	Ke hã, mete ŋu trɔ ɖe megbe fifia o.
I wasn’t and I didn’t trust myself.	Menye eye meka ɖe ɖokuinye dzi o.
In fact, I know this.	Le nyateƒe me la, menya esia.
It is a place of the house.	Enye aƒea ƒe teƒe aɖe.
This is a very great honor.	Esia nye bubu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
We should try something like this.	Ele be míate nane si le abe esia ene kpɔ.
I couldn’t face them.	Nyemete ŋu dze ŋgɔ wo o.
In fact, more than a few.	Le nyateƒe me la, wu ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
He couldn’t control his anger.	Mete ŋu ɖu eƒe dziku dzi o.
It didn’t come easily.	Meva bɔbɔe o.
A simple word here and there.	Nya bɔbɔe aɖe le afisia kple afima.
A little extra here.	Nya sue aɖe kpe ɖe eŋu le afisia.
Which, of course, happened.	Nusi, le nyateƒe me, dzɔ.
I'm alive.	Mele agbe.
Or not really.	Alo menye ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
But the truth is more complicated than that.	Gake nyateƒea sesẽ wu ema.
He was someone else entirely.	Ame bubu aɖee wònye kura.
The people here are here.	Ame siwo le afisia la le afisia.
Over there.	Le afima.
You just can’t do anything with it.	Ðeko màte ŋu awɔ naneke kplii o.
One of them is water.	Wo dometɔ ɖekae nye tsi.
He left yesterday.	Edze mɔ etsɔ.
I wanted him to have that.	Medi be ema nanɔ eŋu.
It's like this.	Ele alea.
That book is not expensive.	Agbalẽ ma mexɔ asi o.
Clearly, the parallel is.	Eme kɔ ƒã be nusi sɔ kple wo nɔewo nye.
It doesn’t do anything.	Mewɔa naneke o.
I’m glad for that.	Edzɔ dzi nam ɖe ema ta.
And it would have been great for him.	Eye anye ne anye nu gã aɖe nɛ hafi.
But it’s not that simple.	Gake menye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
I felt almost alone.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye ɖeka kloe.
For some people.	Na ame aɖewo.
Your kind does it all the time.	Wò ƒomevi wɔa esia ɣesiaɣi.
There are thousands and thousands of them out there now.	Wo dometɔ akpe geɖe kple akpe geɖe le afima fifia.
Just look at you.	Kpɔ wò ɖa ko.
He had a very good reason for it.	Susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ esi ɖe eŋu.
We don’t know what they’re doing.	Míenya nusi wɔm wole o.
My thing about it.	Nye nu tso eŋu.
It’s really simple.	Enye nu bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It has been going on for years.	Ele edzi yim le ƒe geɖe me.
One can hope!.	Ame ate ŋu akpɔ mɔ!.
We couldn’t have done it without them.	Míate ŋu awɔe wo manɔmee o.
You are not going to die.	Menye ɖe nèle kuku ge o.
I am really looking forward to this.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na esia vevie ŋutɔ.
I don’t know them.	Menya wo o.
It was a difficult time.	Ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖee wònye.
It’s not how you got there.	Menye alesi nèwɔ va ɖoe ye o.
That’s weird, really.	Ema nye nusi mewɔ nuku o, le nyateƒe me.
He has so many books.	Agbalẽ geɖe ŋutɔ le esi.
Give us your opinion.	Na wò susu na mí.
This happened last week.	Esia dzɔ le kwasiɖa si va yi me.
But you can see too much.	Gake àte ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe akpa.
That was very difficult for me.	Ema sesẽ nam ŋutɔ.
None of us knew what to make of it.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke menya nusi wòawɔ tso eŋu o.
Go to the field or go home.	Yi gbe me alo yi aƒeme.
That shouldn’t surprise us either.	Mele be ema hã nawɔ nuku na mí o.

She needs warm clothes.	Ehiã awu siwo me dzo le.
To some extent.	Va ɖo afi aɖe.
There is a very place.	Teƒe aɖe ŋutɔ le.
We will starve.	Dɔ awu mí.
Listen.	Ɖo to.
Leave me a comment.	Gblẽ nya aɖe ɖi nam.
It has the following characteristic.	Nɔnɔme si gbɔna la le esi.
His hand is right there.	Eƒe asi le afima tututu.
It didn’t surprise anyone.	Mewɔ nuku na ame aɖeke o.
You know what they are like.	Ènya alesi wole.
I heard his voice, too.	Mese eƒe gbe hã.
I still don’t know what could happen to me.	Nyemenya nusi ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe dzinye haɖe o.
That’s just another thing.	Nu bubu aɖe koe nye ema.
There was good sense in that.	Susu nyui nɔ nya ma me.
I told him he would.	Megblɔ nɛ be awɔe nenema.
He had no room for anything else.	Teƒe aɖeke menɔ esi na nu bubu aɖeke o.
I usually have enough food in my house.	Zi geɖe la, nuɖuɖu si sɔ gbɔ nɔa nye aƒe me.
There are books on that.	Agbalẽ aɖewo li siwo ku ɖe ema ŋu.
There is little he can do.	Nu sue aɖe koe mate ŋu awɔ o.
There was a lot of fire at that time.	Dzo do mo ɖa ŋutɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
I had been watching them.	Menɔ wo kpɔm kpɔ.
This surprised everyone.	Nya sia wɔ nuku na amesiame.
What’s wrong with it?	Nukae gblẽ le eŋu?
I wonder if this is going to be me soon.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe esia ava nye nye kpuie hã.
There has to be a better way.	Ele be mɔ si nyo wu nanɔ anyi.
I work for you.	Mewɔa dɔ na wò.
This is about his whole person.	Esia ku ɖe eƒe ame bliboa ŋu.
Her hair is neat and tidy.	Eƒe ɖa le ɖoɖo nu eye wòle ɖoɖo nu.
I would love to make this my career in some way.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔ esia nye dɔ le mɔ aɖe nu.
This is very easy to do.	Esia wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
That’s what it is.	Emae nye ema.
Right by the main lake.	Le ta gã la to tututu.
Look at that dog!	Kpɔ avu ma ɖa!
Anger stirred in him.	Dziku ƒo ɖe eme.
I was so excited.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ alea gbegbe.
But it is a job.	Gake enye dɔ aɖe.
There is no better way.	Mɔ nyui aɖeke meli o.
But it is something I worry about.	Gake enye nusi ŋu metsi dzi ɖo.
He didn’t show up.	Meɖe eɖokui fia o.
I don’t know though.	Nyemenya o ke hã.
This is very obvious.	Esia dze ƒã ŋutɔ.
Some of them were still alive.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ nɔ agbe.
Just create the shape you want.	Ðeko nàwɔ nɔnɔme si nèdi.
They were all very ready.	Wo katã nɔ klalo ŋutɔ.
I am not you.	Menye nyee nye wò o.
I was just angry.	Ðeko medo dziku.
I have one thing to say.	Nya ɖeka aɖe le asinye.
He just couldn’t.	Ðeko mete ŋui o.
This won’t work either.	Esia hã mawɔ dɔ o.
I understood him.	Mese egɔme nɛ.
He couldn’t think of a better life.	Mete ŋu bu agbe nyui aɖeke si nyo wu ŋu o.
Pass the salt.	To dze la ŋu.
Not that it matters to your kind.	Menye ɖe wòle vevie na wò ƒomevi o.
None of these things are there.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke mele afima o.
I don’t know how to do it.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔe o.
This is still the case.	Esia gakpɔtɔ le alea.
This is so good for me.	Esia nyo nam ale gbegbe.
But it is a lost cause.	Gake enye nya si bu.
It happened well.	Dzɔ nyuie.
There is no such place.	Teƒe aɖeke meli nenema o.
He couldn’t decide.	Mete ŋu tso nya me o.
He refuses to do wrong.	Egbea nu gbegblẽ wɔwɔ.
He didn’t like that dog.	Avu ma medze eŋu o.
Everything was fine.	Nusianu nɔ nyuie.
You can’t say anything.	Màte ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke o.
But it is not a reasonable one.	Gake menye esi me susu le o.
And it’s not easy.	Eye mele bɔbɔe o.
He knew nothing of what had happened to him.	Menya naneke tso nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi ŋu o.
The voice of reason.	Susu ƒe gbe.
He doesn’t want to go beyond the here and now.	Medi be yeayi ŋgɔ wu afisia kple fifia o.
But when he was at home, he was comfortable.	Gake esi wònɔ aƒeme la, eƒe dzi dze eme.
It worked in a way.	Ewɔ dɔ le mɔ aɖe nu.
Everyone is so happy that they lose their jobs.	Amesiame kpɔa dzidzɔ ale gbegbe be dɔ ge le esi.
There was another reason.	Susu bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
Someone did this for me a long time ago.	Ame aɖe wɔ esia nam ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
Think about what you want.	Bu nusi dim nèle ŋu kpɔ.
Take one step at a time.	Ðe afɔ ɖeka ɖeka.
If he is there .	Ne ele afima la .
There are some good things about it.	Nu nyui aɖewo le eŋu.
I have a very good idea.	Susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ le asinye.
From his room.	Tso eƒe xɔ me.
He worked hard for many years.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe ƒe geɖe.
Thank you, that’s great.	Akpe na wò, ema nyo ŋutɔ.
Seems like a good idea.	Edze abe susu nyui aɖee wònye ene.
It will save us.	Axɔ na mí.
This guy wants something.	Ŋutsu sia di nane.
He looked like a goat.	Edze abe gbɔ̃ ene.
It is a very small book.	Enye agbalẽ si le sue ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t just break away.	Mete ŋu ɖe eɖokui ɖa ko o.
The result didn’t matter.	Nusi do tso eme la meɖe fu o.
It is the voice of the past.	Enye gbe si nɔ anyi va yi.
And this is different.	Eye esia to vovo.
Yet, his attitude changed completely.	Ke hã eƒe nɔnɔme trɔ kura.
Never started anything without it.	Medze naneke gɔme eya manɔmee kpɔ o.
That was an hour of my life.	Ema nye nye agbe ƒe gaƒoƒo ɖeka.
Only the latecomers arrived.	Ame siwo tsi megbe la koe va ɖo.
Everyone had a role to play.	Akpa aɖe nɔ amesiame si.

I was just talking to him tonight.	Ðeko menɔ nu ƒom nɛ le zã sia me.
No one could explain.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu ɖe eme o.
It has nothing to do with me, of course.	Nye nya aɖeke mele eme o ya.
He was a very tough guy, but he had a big heart.	Enye ame sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ, gake dzi gã aɖe nɔ esi.
I didn’t want to stay there all night.	Nyemedi be manɔ afima zã bliboa o.
Be careful with that.	Kpɔ nyuie le ema ŋu.
For once, it didn’t seem to matter much.	Zi ɖeka la, edze abe mehiã boo o ene.

You know what will happen.	Ènya nusi adzɔ.
If only for something.	Ne nane koe.
I don’t know you at all.	Nyemenya wò kura o.
How long ago it was.	Ɣeyiɣi didi kae wònye va yi.
It was never like that.	Menɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
This is so hard for so many people.	Esia sesẽ na ame geɖe alea gbegbe.
It started out as it is.	Edze egɔme abe alesi wòle ene.
Everyone he worked with.	Ame sia ame si wòwɔ dɔ kplii.
I would love to find someone new.	Madi vevie be makpɔ ame yeye aɖe.
It doesn’t matter now.	Mehiã fifia o.
He can’t do that.	Mate ŋu awɔe nenema o.
Thousands more.	Ame akpe geɖe wu.
I got into a bit of trouble.	Meva ge ɖe kuxi aɖe me vie.
He had someone else.	Ame bubu aɖe hã nɔ esi.
It was this or nothing.	Enye esia alo naneke o.
I stayed at his house.	Menɔ eƒe aƒeme.
This means two things.	Esia fia nu eve.
But there was no time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I heard his voice.	Mese eƒe gbe.
No one came to see them.	Ame aɖeke meva kpɔ wo o.
People will be there.	Amewo anɔ afima.
It doesn’t seem to have.	Edze abe mewɔe nenema o ene.
But that would be totally wrong.	Gake ema anye nu gbegblẽ kura.
That would be great.	Ema anyo ŋutɔ.
I am single now.	Menye tre fifia.
But he couldn’t resist.	Gake mete ŋu tsi tre ɖe eŋu o.
We have what we are doing at home.	Nusi wɔm míele le aƒeme la le mía si.
He wasn't being nice to her.	Menye ɖe wònɔ nu wɔm ɖe eŋu nyuie o.
I have seen what you have done.	Mekpɔ nu siwo nèwɔ.
I couldn’t see them.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ wo o.
So far we have two children.	Vaseɖe fifia la, vi eve le mía si.

Surgery will likely be required.	Anɔ eme be ahiã be woawɔ dɔ nɛ.
Now the car is running fine.	Fifia ʋua le du dzi nyuie.
I did the same thing.	Nye hã mewɔe nenema.
There was a precursor to the project.	Nusi do ŋgɔ na dɔa nɔ anyi.
One other person survived.	Ame ɖeka bubu aɖe hã tsi agbe.

Who knows where he had been the day before.	Amekae nya afisi wònɔ le ŋkeke si do ŋgɔ me.
That’s another thing, too.	Ema hã nye nu bubu aɖe.
I really want this to work.	Medi vevie be esia nawɔ dɔ.
It won’t go anywhere.	Mayi afi aɖeke o.
Picture your home.	Kpɔ wò aƒe ɖa le susu me.
One person did not say where they lived.	Ame ɖeka megblɔ afisi wole o.
But after about a week it started to get a little easier.	Gake le abe kwasiɖa ɖeka ene megbe la, edze egɔme nɔ bɔbɔe vie.
Please take a break.	Taflatse, gbɔ ɖe eme vie.
In your home.	Le wò aƒe me.
And we really don’t know much about it yet.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, míenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu haɖe o.
It’s like something new.	Ele abe nu yeye ene.
Something else caught on.	Nu bubu aɖe hã lé.

I couldn’t have done it without you.	Mate ŋu awɔe ne menye wò o.
That’s his thing.	Emae nye eƒe nu.

Maybe the same thing.	Ðewohĩ nenema ke.
This is very important to me, please believe me.	Esia le vevie nam ŋutɔ, taflatse xɔ dzinye se.
You have to do better than before.	Ele be nàwɔ nu nyuie wu tsã.
This is not a new problem.	Esia menye kuxi yeye o.

It felt too soon.	Ewɔ nam be ewɔ kaba akpa.
There were people there.	Amewo nɔ afima.
It's just like you and me.	Ele abe nye kple wò ene ko.
That was all he expected.	Nu ma koe wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na.
I need to know more.	Ele be manya nu geɖe wu.
Not tomorrow or a few months from now.	Menye etsɔ alo ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo tso fifia dzi o.
You are on my side.	Èle nye akpa dzi.
You can do this out loud or in your head.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia sesĩe alo le ta me.
It’s been a while.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
I was in good shape.	Menɔ nɔnɔme nyui me.
It will be here.	Anɔ afisia.
I had to be with someone.	Ele be manɔ ame aɖe gbɔ.
And that’s a bad thing.	Eye esia nye nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
And it didn't.	Le ga la ta.
It’s part of the same thing.	Enye nu ɖeka ma ke ƒe akpa aɖe.
It’s also a huge hit.	Enye nusi xɔ ŋkɔ ŋutɔ hã.
I saw them four times.	Mekpɔ wo zi ene.
The only thing missing is you.	Nusi bu koe nye wò.
Now go to your room.	Azɔ yi wò xɔ me.
We have nothing to do with that.	Naneke mele mía kple ema dome o.
I don’t want to see what’s there.	Nyemedi be makpɔ nusi le afima o.
Any road connecting two cities.	Mɔ ɖesiaɖe si ƒoa du eve nu ƒu.
It was his place, a building near a lake.	Enye eƒe teƒe, xɔ aɖe si te ɖe ta aɖe ŋu.
It really makes sense.	Susu le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It is very important that you do something.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ be nàwɔ nane.

I can see that when it works.	Mete ŋu kpɔa ema ne ewɔ dɔ.
What is that ?	Nukae nye ema?
There was that possibility.	Nu ma si ate ŋu adzɔ nɔ anyi.
But it doesn’t matter at this point.	Gake mehiã le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
Find something in your home.	Di nane le wò aƒe me.
What works for you today, may not work tomorrow.	Nusi le dɔ wɔm na wò egbea, ɖewohĩ mawɔ dɔ etsɔ o.
I had to sit back and enjoy it.	Ele be manɔ anyi akpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu.
Anyone can see us for a price.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu akpɔ mí ɖe asi aɖe ta.
But there are reasons why it might not.	Gake susu aɖewo li siwo tae mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
The pool has no water or leaks in the pool.	Ta la me tsi alo do go aɖeke le ta la me o.
I don’t know, maybe it’s just something he can do.	Nyemenya o, ɖewohĩ nane si wòate ŋu awɔ koe wònye.
My teacher said this was impossible.	Nye nufiala gblɔ be esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
He started the car.	Edze ʋua gɔme.
I don’t feel at all like I feel about it now.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kura be mese le ɖokuinye me le eŋu fifia o.
But he couldn’t.	Gake mete ŋui o.
Everyone.	Ame sia ame.
It was their only chance.	Eya koe nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ na wo.
They had no food.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
He had only been working with her for two weeks.	Kwasiɖa eve koe nye esia wònɔ dɔ wɔm kplii.
That doesn’t matter.	Ema mehiã o.
That’s not my concern.	Menye emae nye nusi ŋu metsi dzi ɖo o.
He too fell hard.	Eya hã dze anyi sesĩe.
I need you.	Mehiã wò.
He was a good horse and had had a good life.	Sɔ nyui aɖee wònye eye wònɔ agbe nyui aɖe kpɔ.
There will never be a better time.	Ɣeyiɣi si nyo wu ema manɔ anyi gbeɖe o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But you do this.	Gake wòe wɔa esia.
Two things have changed.	Nu eve aɖewo trɔ.
That’s what got me.	Emae nye nusi na mexɔ.
Time is running out for this man.	Ɣeyiɣi nu va yi na ŋutsu sia.
I’d love to know what you think.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be manya nusi wò susu.
Thousands of people from.	Ame akpe geɖe tso.
They had no one else.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
Or, well.	Alo, nyuie.
I have to have a life.	Ele be agbe nanɔ asinye.
What matters is you.	Nusi le vevie enye wò.
Some kind of place, maybe.	Teƒe ƒomevi aɖe, ɖewohĩ.
He didn’t let me let anything go.	Meɖe mɔ nam be maɖe asi le naneke ŋu o.
I got myself out of that situation very hard.	Meɖe ɖokuinye le nɔnɔme ma me sesẽ ŋutɔ.
New and old.	Yeye kple xoxo.
The reasons for this are varied.	Susu siwo tae esia tso la to vovo.
That is impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
This surprised me a lot.	Esia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
There is something that worries me now.	Nya aɖe li si na metsi dzi fifia.
There’s nothing we can’t work together.	Naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ dɔ ɖekae o.
Like two years ago.	Abe ƒe eve siwo va yi ene.
I was the only one in the car.	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ ʋua me.
Not the same situation.	Menye nɔnɔme ma ke o.
I am looking forward to doing that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be mawɔ ema.
But he couldn’t enjoy much else.	Gake mete ŋu kpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe nu bubu geɖe ŋu o.
He seems to have it all.	Edze abe wo katã le esi ene.
But many problems remain.	Gake kuxi geɖe gakpɔtɔ li.
It would be a very real challenge.	Anye kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe ŋutɔ.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But the real hard truth is different.	Gake nyateƒe sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ la to vovo.
Its very simple.	Eƒe bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
But there is a small problem.	Gake kuxi sue aɖe li.
What is good for them is good for all.	Nu si nyo na wo la nyo na amewo katã.
We can raise another issue.	Míate ŋu afɔ nya bubu ɖe te.
Two all week.	Eve kwasiɖa bliboa katã.
He had never been home at this hour.	Menɔ aƒeme le gaƒoƒo sia me kpɔ o.
There was no one inside.	Ame aɖeke menɔ eme o.
I don’t know how he knew that.	Nyemenya alesi wòwɔ nya emae o.
Some people have him, some people don’t.	Eya le ame aɖewo si, ya mele ame aɖewo si o.
He saw no other results.	Mekpɔ nu bubu aɖeke si do tso eme o.
For many years.	Ƒe geɖe.
And before that.	Eye do ŋgɔ nɛ.
Let him do this.	Na wòawɔ esia.
I’ve seen this before.	Mekpɔ esia kpɔ.
This is already old.	Esia nye xoxo xoxo.
He also had more.	Nu geɖe wu nɔ esi hã.
I have to know.	Ele be manya.
Good thing he finally escaped.	Nu nyui aɖee wònye be esi mlɔeba.
The logic is very clear.	Susu si le eme la me kɔ ŋutɔ.
You can do this from anywhere.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia tso afi sia afi.
That would have been better.	Ema anyo wu hafi.
However, more work is always needed.	Ke hã, dɔ geɖe wu hiã ɣesiaɣi.
This gave us a sense of satisfaction.	Esia na míaƒe dzi dze eme.
But I’m not sure what that is.	Gake nyemeka ɖe edzi be nukae nye ema o.
I grew up with him with him.	Metsi kplii kplii.
See the chapter.	Kpɔ ta.
Check this out.	Kpɔ esia ɖa.
We know where you are.	Míenya afi si nèle.
Make what you want out of this.	Wɔ nusi nèdi tso esia me.
And that’s what we’re ready to do.	Eye emae nye nusi míele klalo be míawɔ.
I don’t have anything.	Naneke mele asinye o.
At that point, the project changed.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, dɔa trɔ.
The word "is" is superfluous.	Nya "nye" nye nusi mehiã o.
One way or another, it doesn’t matter.	Le mɔ aɖe nu alo bubu nu la, mehiã o.
That space is usually filled with blood.	Zi geɖe la, ʋu xɔa teƒe ma.
It will help me.	Akpe ɖe ŋunye.
These others seem well worth a little hard work.	Edze abe bubu siawo sɔ nyuie na dɔ sesẽ vi aɖe ene.
The wind blew hard in my face.	Ya ƒo sesĩe ɖe nye mo.
That confirms the final straw.	Ema ɖo kpe gbe mamlɛtɔ dzi.
This will not work.	Esia mawɔ dɔ o.
It was too early.	Enye nusi do ŋgɔ akpa.
I was focused on food.	Nye susu nɔ nuɖuɖu ŋu.
There was a little time.	Ɣeyiɣi nɔ anyi vie.
But not so long ago.	Gake menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia o.
That’s going on, too.	Ema hã le edzi yim.
No one did that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
This project is very similar to ours.	Dɔ sia sɔ kple míaƒe dɔa ŋutɔ.
Hide.	Be.
He's calling me.	Ele ka ƒom nam.
Blood, of course.	Ʋu, ya.
I didn’t know they were in it.	Nyemenya be wole eme o.
He couldn’t remember what it was like before.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku alesi wònɔ tsã dzi o.
But that day is far away.	Gake ŋkeke ma gbɔ didi ŋutɔ.
And everyone was against us.	Eye amesiame tsi tre ɖe mía ŋu.
You the you.	Tu la tu.
This is a difficult issue.	Esia nye nya sesẽ aɖe.
Almost everyone, anyway.	Amesiame kloe, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
But he cannot have this.	Gake esia mate ŋu anɔ esi o.
To have his money.	Be eƒe ga nanɔ esi.
I am looking forward to next summer for the first time.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na dzomeŋɔli si gbɔna zi gbãtɔ.
You have to follow that plan.	Ele be nàwɔ ɖoɖo ma dzi.

They have a good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe le wo si.
How do you do this?	Aleke nàwɔ esia?
Let go of everything.	Ðe asi le nusianu ŋu.
There is no next week.	Kwasiɖa si gbɔna meli o.
I never had a problem with it.	Nyemekpɔ kuxi aɖeke kplii kpɔ o.
That’s a lie, too.	Ema nye alakpa, hã.
Put the gun down.	Da tu la ɖe anyi.
I have been here before.	Menɔ afisia do ŋgɔ.
But the opposite is true.	Gake nusi to vovo na emae.
I started with myself.	Medze egɔme tso nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye dzi.
For people, for me.	Na amewo, na nye hã.
He was so interested in it.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme ale gbegbe.
I'm listening.	Mele nu tom.
For very different reasons.	Susu siwo to vovo kura tae.
I am still the same.	Megale nenema kokoko.
But he didn’t show up.	Gake meɖe eɖokui fia o.
I don’t want to see anything.	Nyemedi be makpɔ naneke o.
Please stop that.	Taflatse tsi ema.
I wanted to try something different.	Medi be mate nu bubu aɖe kpɔ.
I don’t have to do that.	Mehiã be mawɔe nenema o.
I was very happy with it.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ɖe eŋu.
The building was badly damaged by fire.	Dzo gblẽ nu le xɔa ŋu vevie.
Quite the opposite, in fact.	Le nyateƒe me la, to vovo kura na ema.
Who won the battle?	Amekae ɖu dzi?
I will tell you that.	Magblɔ nya ma na wò.
Overall, the work is excellent.	Le nusianu me la, dɔa nyo ŋutɔ.
Easier to work with.	Ele bɔbɔe wu be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
I don’t know what to say.	Nyemenya nusi magblɔ o.
You’re just trying to live up to something positive.	Ðeko nèle agbagba dzem be yeanɔ agbe ɖe nu nyui aɖe nu.
I think we should do this together.	Mesusu be ele be míawɔ esia ɖekae.
It’s a different thing.	Enye nusi to vovo.
There is one thing.	Nu ɖeka aɖe li.
But that seems to suit him just fine now.	Gake edze abe ema sɔ nɛ nyuie fifia ene.
We each took a deep breath.	Mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe gbɔ ya didi aɖe.
I just don’t know.	Ðeko nyemenya o.
But I don’t feel weird alone.	Gake nyemese le ɖokuinye me be nye ɖeka koe mewɔ nuku o.
He didn’t expect anything.	Mekpɔ mɔ na naneke o.
Which teaches you what a young child knows.	Nusi fia nusi ɖevi sue aɖe nya la wò.
That dress is amazing.	Awu ma wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I settled down pretty quickly.	Meva tsi anyi kaba ŋutɔ.
We will only have one gun.	Tu ɖeka koe anɔ mía si.
My next post will be awesome.	Nye nya si gbɔna la awɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It can’t be a good thing.	Mate ŋu anye nu nyui aɖeke o.
Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Ðewohĩ mehiã o.
I was already fine.	Menɔ nyuie xoxo.
But this is something completely different.	Gake esia nye nusi to vovo kura.
Reality is a lie.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ nye alakpa.
A strong wind blew strongly.	Ya sesẽ aɖe ƒo sesĩe.
He seemed surprised.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ ene.
It was a really good time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.

Not many, maybe.	Menye ame geɖe o, ɖewohĩ.
A path was left behind.	Mɔ aɖe gblẽ ɖi.
Just like it used to be.	Abe alesi wònɔ tsã ene.
He couldn’t go back.	Mete ŋu trɔ yi megbe o.
You’ll be thrilled.	Adzɔ dzi na wò.
He worked so hard in the last year.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe ale gbegbe le ƒe mamlɛtɔ me.
But not much else by this point.	Gake menye nu bubu geɖe hafi va ɖo afisia o.
However, have your way.	Ke hã, wò mɔ nanɔ asiwò.
I think it looks really good so far.	Mesusu be edze nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ vaseɖe fifia.
I had this problem once.	Kuxi sia nɔ ŋunye zi ɖeka.
He was angry with her.	Dziku nɔ eŋu.
And he did that thing.	Eye wòwɔ nu ma.
That’s everything.	Emae nye nusianu.
They have no parts.	Akpa aɖeke mele wo ŋu o.
He is a man of action.	Enye ame si wɔa nu.
That wasn’t me.	Menye nyee nye ema o.
I am not in a good voice.	Nyemele gbe nyui me o.
And he can understand that.	Eye ate ŋu ase esia gɔme.
And you can still have fun.	Eye àte ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ kokoko.
Be as good as you are.	Nye ame nyui abe wò ke ene.
Use your anger.	Zã wò dziku.
He never gave up on that.	Meɖe asi le ema ŋu gbeɖe o.
I am one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖekae menye.
He didn’t say anything about it.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke tso eŋu o.

I didn’t know what to expect.	Nyemenya nusi makpɔ mɔ na o.
Just one of many.	Ame geɖe dometɔ ɖeka ko.
Things got a little out of hand this time.	Nuwo va do le asi me vie zi sia.
He wasn’t around yesterday.	Menɔ anyi etsɔ o.
Something is wrong with him.	Nane gblẽ le eŋu.
There was no other room.	Xɔ bubu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
No one asked any questions.	Ame aɖeke mebia nya aɖeke o.
I really want to say thank you.	Medi vevie be magblɔ akpe na wò.
Maybe that’s good.	Ðewohĩ esia nyo.
That would be a real loss.	Ema anye nusi bu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But it wasn’t obvious to me.	Gake medze ƒã nam o.
Just like anywhere else.	Abe alesi wòle le teƒe ɖesiaɖe ene.
Look right in front of your face now.	Kpɔ wò mo ŋgɔ tututu fifia.
In fact, if you say.	Le nyateƒe me la, ne ègblɔ be.
Yesterday was a long day.	Etsɔ nye ŋkeke didi aɖe.
And we need to do something about your name.	Eye ele be míawɔ nane tso wò ŋkɔ ŋu.

He had a problem with it.	Kuxi aɖe nɔ eŋu.

And that would be great.	Eye ema anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Let me just say this.	Mina magblɔ nya sia ko.

Forward, or backward.	Yi ŋgɔ, alo yi megbe.
The man who came to our room, please leave.	Ŋutsu si va míaƒe xɔ me la, taflatse dzo.
And maybe he didn’t.	Eye ɖewohĩ mewɔe nenema o.
He was a little surprised, but not that surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ vie, gake mewɔ nuku nɛ nenema gbegbe o.
I decided to do it tonight.	Meɖoe be mawɔe le zã sia me.
Everyone is clear.	Amesiame me kɔ.
Summer is over.	Dzomeŋɔli wu enu.
Look, there it is!	Kpɔ ɖa, le afima!
But there are some exceptions.	Gake nu aɖewo li siwo to vovo na ema.
Maybe he has some mental problems.	Ðewohĩ susu me kuxi aɖewo le eŋu.

He might be the only one who would enjoy it.	Ðewohĩ eya ɖeka koe akpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu.
But, we didn’t have a song.	Gake, ha aɖeke menɔ mía si o.

I’m surprised to see you here.	Ewɔ nuku nam be mekpɔ wò le afisia.

He was a strong man.	Enye ŋutsu sesẽ aɖe.

He had already lost his job.	Dɔ ge le esi xoxo.
He is one in a thousand.	Enye ame ɖeka le ame akpe ɖeka me.
He didn’t say anything to them.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke na wo o.
That is possible now.	Be anya wɔ fifia.
It was clear as day.	Edze ƒã abe ŋkeke ene.
My whole life is for you.	Nye agbe bliboa nye na wò.
Your hair is inconsistent.	Wò ɖa mewɔa ɖeka o.
Now, everyone else is seeing the same thing.	Fifia, ame bubu ɖesiaɖe le nu ɖeka ma ke kpɔm.
I am too small for him.	Mele sue akpa nɛ.
But he can’t do it.	Gake mate ŋui o.
I don’t know what to do with it now.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ kplii fifia o.
I was twice the age of some of these kids.	Mexɔ ɖevi siawo dometɔ aɖewo ƒe ƒe teƒe eve.
I did it the same night.	Mewɔe le zã ma ke me.

A man needs money to travel.	Ŋutsu hiã ga hafi ate ŋu azɔ mɔ.
That’s all in good order.	Ema katã le ɖoɖo nyui nu.
This is exciting.	Esia do dzidzɔ na ame.
Actually, that’s a little more complicated.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema sesẽ vie wu.
I am getting way ahead of myself.	Mele ŋgɔ yim ŋutɔ wu ɖokuinye.
I found some new words.	Mekpɔ nya yeye aɖewo.
None of them worked for me.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ dɔ nam o.

And he was only a child.	Eye ɖevi koe wònye.
And in a few places, that is true.	Eye le teƒe ʋɛ aɖewo la, nya ma nye nyateƒe.
Nobody needs money like that.	Ame aɖeke mehiã ga nenema o.
There should be no school today.	Mele be suku aɖeke nanɔ anyi egbea o.

But things are not so simple.	Gake nuwo mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
Think carefully about what you are going to do.	Bu nu si wɔ ge nèle ŋu nyuie.
However, we do not know the exact circumstances underlying this phase.	Gake míenya nɔnɔme siwo tututu gbɔ akpa sia tso o.
I don’t want to live without him.	Nyemedi be manɔ agbe eya manɔmee o.
We need to act quickly.	Ele be míawɔ nu kaba.
What a good idea.	Susu nyui kae nye si.
Not much more to say.	Menye nu geɖe wu magblɔ o.
What is lost on him.	Nusi bu ɖe edzi.
A point is in order here.	Nya aɖe le ɖoɖo nu le afisia.
He had no teeth.	Aɖu aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
This may be the last water available.	Esia ate ŋu anye tsi mamlɛtɔ si anɔ anyi.
But other than that, everything was fine.	Gake ne menye nenema o la, nusianu nɔ nyuie.
No one came near him.	Ame aɖeke mete ɖe eŋu o.
A good way to go.	Mɔ nyui aɖe.
I looked into it.	Mekpɔ nu le eme.
I’m seeing that myself these days.	Nye ŋutɔ mele ema kpɔm le ŋkeke siawo me.
It was four o'clock in the afternoon.	Ŋdɔ ga ene ye.
And for me, too.	Eye na nye hã.
You have to do your part.	Ele be nàwɔ wò akpa dzi.
Nor did he explain who he was.	Eye meɖe amesi wònye hã me o.
I am going to take this away.	Mele esia xɔ ge ɖa.
Click, click, again.	Zi edzi, zi edzi, ake.
It’s almost everyone.	Ame sia ame kloe ye.
We knew it wouldn’t be easy.	Míenya be manɔ bɔbɔe o.
Now it’s back.	Fifia la trɔ gbɔ.
This will be a problem.	Esia anye kuxi.
This city has blossomed,	Du sia ƒo se, .
And we have work to do.	Eye dɔ le mía si míawɔ.
On the contrary, this is a difficult time.	To vovo na ema la, ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖee nye esia.
A language that everyone understands.	Gbe si gɔme amesiame se.
None of them were there.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ afima o.
But it will be expensive.	Gake ava xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
The highly anticipated book is out this month.	Agbalẽ si wole mɔ kpɔm na vevie la le ɣleti sia me.
Please can you check them out.	Taflatse àte ŋu akpɔ wo ɖa.
It is a simple task.	Enye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖe.
He seemed like a nice guy.	Edze abe ame nyui aɖee wònye ene.
There must be a final element in this case.	Ele be nu mamlɛtɔ nanɔ nya sia me.
I was in a bad way.	Menɔ mɔ gbegblẽ aɖe nu.
Trust me, twice is more than enough.	Ka ɖe dzinye, zi eve sɔ gbɔ wu alesi wòle.
There can be no one else.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
More stuff like this thanks.	Nu geɖe wu abe esia ene akpe.
Fresh air is good for you.	Ya nyui nyo na wò.
He doesn’t have much money.	Ga boo aɖeke mele esi o.
He has someone.	Ame aɖe le esi.
I have to work.	Ele be mawɔ dɔ.
I am trying to find another job.	Mele agbagba dzem be madi dɔ bubu.
There was no night.	Zã aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Water is vital to life.	Tsi le vevie ŋutɔ na agbe.
Again, nothing major.	Le afisia hã la, naneke gã aɖeke meli o.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ema menye nu gbegblẽ o.
You have what you want.	Nusi dim nèle la le asiwò.
It worked really well for me.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie nam ŋutɔ.
Now, of course, he's going to say that.	Fifia, le nyateƒe me la, ele nya ma gblɔ ge.
It didn’t bother him.	Meɖe fu nɛ o.
The whole thing is surreal.	Nu bliboa nye nusi me susu mele o.
Understand, understand what you’re doing.	Se egɔme, se nusi wɔm nèle la gɔme.
But this place changed my mind about that.	Gake teƒe sia trɔ nye susu le nya ma ŋu.
You have to do something.	Ele be nàwɔ nane.
I blinked, a little worried.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe nu ŋu, eye metsi dzi vie.
I hope you can do it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu awɔe.
A hand gripped his gun.	Asi aɖe lé eƒe tu la.
Still, it was a good life.	Ke hã, agbe nyui aɖee wònye.
That is the truth.	Emae nye nyateƒea.
Ema li of the teti.	Ema li ya teti.
Not that either.	Menye ema hã o.
Everyone is different, of course.	Ame sia ame to vovo ya.
Not too bad, really.	Menye nu gbegblẽ akpa o, le nyateƒe me.
He started sweating.	Edze fifia gɔme.
Stand right here.	Tsi tre ɖe teƒe sia tututu.
This can be a costly waste of time and money.	Esia ate ŋu anye ɣeyiɣi kple ga gbegblẽ si xɔa ga geɖe.
Something stuck to the edge.	Nane si lé ɖe eƒe go ŋu.
It’s not surprising.	Mewɔ nuku o.
Have a nice day.	Ŋkeke nyui aɖe.
I know that sounds weird.	Menya be nya ma ɖi nusi mewɔ nuku o.
The room changed.	Xɔa me trɔ.
How did he not do that.	Aleke mewɔe nenema o.
We could have gone with him.	Míate ŋu ayi kplii hafi.
But anyone can do it cheaply.	Gake amesiame ate ŋu awɔe le asi bɔbɔe me.
And it can’t be any other way for you.	Eye mate ŋu anye mɔ bubu aɖeke na wò o.
He should have been able to help.	Ðe wòle be wòate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu hafi.
Perhaps he is a real person.	Ðewohĩ enye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And many of them are taller than them.	Eye wo dometɔ geɖe kɔ wu wo.
He has done this before.	Ewɔ esia do ŋgɔ.
I said that.	Megblɔ nya ma.
He will find something to do.	Akpɔ nane si wòawɔ.
He must have one.	Ele be ɖeka nanɔ esi.
He marveled at the simplicity of it all.	Alesi wò katã le bɔbɔe la wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
For this he made time.	Le esia ta la, ewɔ ɣeyiɣi.
After that, it worked.	Le ema megbe la, ewɔ dɔ.
Balance, always balance.	Da sɔ, da sɔ ɣesiaɣi.
They are all part of us.	Wo katã nye míaƒe akpa aɖe.
And you have something else missing.	Eye nu bubu aɖe hã li si bu na wò.
The car is really interesting.	Ʋua doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Yet the same old problem persists.	Ke hã kuxi xoxo ma ke gakpɔtɔ li.
Focus on the more important things.	Lé fɔ ɖe nu si le vevie wu la ŋu.
I'll take the gun out.	Maɖe tu la ɖa.
I wasn’t sure how to do it.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi mawɔe dzi o.
Come on now.	Va fifia.
Couldn't see anything from here.	Mete ŋu kpɔ naneke tso afisia o.
He gave her a handshake.	Etsɔ asi ƒo ɖe eŋu.
The roads here are very dusty.	Ke le mɔ siwo le afisia dzi ŋutɔ.
It might be too far.	Ðewohĩ anye nusi yi ŋgɔ akpa.
The time of time.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe ɣeyiɣi.
It’s just a little bit.	Enye nu sue aɖe ko.
Someone must know something.	Ame aɖe anya nane godoo.
There is a path through them.	Mɔ aɖe li to wo me.
The meeting with one mind.	Kpekpea kple susu ɖeka.
And he didn’t do that.	Eye mewɔe nenema o.
That house means something to you.	Aƒe ma fia nane na wò.
But it worked for me.	Gake ewɔ dɔ nam.
When was that time?	Ɣekaɣie nye ema?
It is a very normal thing.	Enye nusi sɔ ŋutɔ.
Everyone was happy.	Amesiame kpɔ dzidzɔ.
I make him one, he makes me one.	Mewɔa eya ɖeka, eya hã wɔa ɖeka nam.
Another in the past two years .	Bubu le ƒe eve siwo va yi me .
I set it to false.	Meɖoe ɖe alakpa dzi.
Everyone knows what is most important.	Amesiame nya nusi le vevie wu.
It’s not a big deal.	Menye nya gã aɖee wònye o.
That would be a mistake.	Ema anye vodada.
This is a small town.	Du sue aɖee nye esia.
He did what he did.	Ewɔ nu si wòwɔ.
I was concerned about this.	Metsi dzi ɖe esia ŋu.
And he didn’t know.	Eye menya o.
Not the other way around.	Menye mɔ bubu nu o.
So much for that ideal.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ na susu nyui ma.
Take them to heart.	Tsɔ wo de dzi me.
It was an issue that was still bothering me.	Enye nya si nɔ fu ɖem nam haɖe.
I am in it here and there.	Mele eme le afisia kple afima.
I am fine with this.	Mele nyuie le esia ŋu.
This didn’t please him at all.	Esia medze eŋu kura o.
He didn’t know where they were going.	Menya afi si yim wole o.
And neither should anyone.	Eye mele be ame aɖeke hã o.
I know this is the truth.	Menya be esia nye nyateƒea.
He had a lot of things.	Nu geɖe nɔ esi.
And it doesn’t matter what you do.	Eye nu si nàwɔ la mehiã o.
But this is one of them.	Gake esia nye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
That’s a pretty amazing thing.	Ema nye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This is actually very expensive to do.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu sia wɔwɔ xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Please give us now.	Taflatse na mí fifia.
This is something else entirely.	Esia nye nu bubu kura.
He also liked his name.	Eƒe ŋkɔ hã dze eŋu.
It’s a foot.	Enye afɔ.
Always wear an old suit.	Do awu xoxo aɖe ɣesiaɣi.
It can be a word or part of a word.	Ate ŋu anye nya aɖe alo nya aɖe ƒe akpa aɖe.
But he himself knew nothing about it.	Gake eya ŋutɔ menya naneke tso eŋu o.
That’s two for me.	Ema nye eve nam.
Or what he’s supposed to do for you.	Alo nusi wòle be wòawɔ na wò.
He couldn’t understand it.	Mete ŋu se egɔme o.
I'm going to continue.	Mele edzi yim.
I am not the police.	Menye nyee nye kpovitɔwo o.
He can’t talk at length.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu didi o.

If you can help in the next few days.	Ne àte ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu le ŋkeke ʋɛ siwo gbɔna me.
I remember it very well.	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie ŋutɔ.
It was a beautiful day.	Ŋkeke nyui aɖee wònye.
Let me deal with you in his time.	Na mawɔ nu ɖe ​​eƒe ɣeyiɣi ŋu na wò.
It will kill you.	Awu wò.
He is just like everyone else.	Ele abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
It didn’t last a year.	Menɔ anyi ƒe ɖeka o.
I know he did a couple of these things.	Menya be ewɔ nu siawo dometɔ eve aɖewo.
He could have done this.	Ate ŋu awɔ esia hafi.
Hold on tight!	Lé ɖe asi sesĩe!
These items can exist separately.	Nu siawo ate ŋu anɔ anyi ɖe vovo.
I'm here.	Mele afisia.
I want to withdraw money.	Medi be maɖe ga.
But he couldn’t run any faster.	Gake mete ŋu ƒu du sesĩe wu ema o.
Not as a separate entity.	Menye abe nusi le eɖokui si ene o.
He will do it soon.	Awɔe kpuie.
And neither did anyone else.	Eye ame bubu aɖeke hã mewɔe nenema o.
How far is this true?	Afikae nya sia nye nyateƒe se ɖo?
You are the only one I trust to do this for me.	Wò ɖeka koe meka ɖe edzi be nàwɔ esia nam.
Something about them.	Nane tso wo ŋu.
But I'm the one.	Ke nye ya.
I actually had this same issue just a couple of days ago.	Le nyateƒe me la, nya sia ke nɔ ŋunye ŋkeke eve aɖewo koe nye esia.
And of course, it can’t take more than a year.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, mate ŋu axɔ wu ƒe ɖeka o.
These items are usually very expensive.	Zi geɖe la, nu siawo xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Also some more for myself.	Azɔ hã bubu aɖewo na ɖokuinye.
But he was satisfied.	Gake eƒe dzi dze eme.
If you were, what would you do?	Ne wòe nye ema la, nukae nàwɔ?
Another didi.	Bubu didi.
See what it did to you.	Kpɔ nu si wòwɔ ɖe ŋuwò la ɖa.
Now he's giving you a bad time too.	Fifia ele ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ aɖe nam wò hã.
This happened once.	Esia dzɔ zi ɖeka.
This is certainly appropriate.	Esia sɔ godoo.
A few people were eating.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ nu ɖum.
What is that.	Nukae nye ema.
More or less at the same time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka ma ke me wu alo wu nenema.
The water is dirty.	Tsi ƒo ɖi.
Now look at you.	Azɔ lé ŋku ɖe ŋuwò.
The same will happen to you.	Adzɔ nenema na wò hã.
We don’t really know about that.	Míenya nu tso nya ma ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I couldn’t take care of myself.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ ɖokuinye dzi o.
This will do two things.	Esia awɔ nu eve.
They should have nothing better to do.	Mele be naneke nanɔ wo si woawɔ si nyo wu ema o.
How was he this morning?	Aleke eƒe nɔnɔme nɔ ŋdi sia?
If possible, today itself.	Ne anya wɔ la, egbea ŋutɔ.

It’s not that it matters.	Menye ɖe wòle vevie o.
I asked a simple question.	Mebia nya bɔbɔe aɖe.

Tom didn't answer.	Tom meɖo eŋu o.
There couldn’t have been a better day.	Ŋkeke aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi si nyo wu ema o.
There were some good things.	Nu nyui aɖewo nɔ anyi.

And we’re well on our way to that.	Eye míele mɔ dzi nyuie yi ema gbɔ.
This is a clever idea.	Esia nye susu si me aɖaŋu le.
Help me out, please.	Kpe ɖe ŋunye.
It’s almost surprising that it is.	Ewɔ nuku kloe be ele nenema.
Only those who dare to try can reach the top.	Ame siwo ƒo dzi ate kpɔ koe ate ŋu aɖo ta dzi.
There are people here.	Amewo le afisia.
It could not be a more beautiful place.	Mate ŋu anye teƒe si nya kpɔ wu ema o.
If not, enter a new object name.	Ne menye nenema o la, ke ŋlɔ nu yeye aɖe ƒe ŋkɔ.
One just hit us last night.	Ðeko ɖeka ƒo mí le zã si va yi me.
But now there is a problem.	Gake fifia kuxi aɖe li.
And that's it.	Le eya ta.
I have never had anyone order me to do anything on it.	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke ɖe gbe nam kpɔ be mawɔ naneke ɖe edzi o.
But this may have backfired.	Gake ɖewohĩ esia va gblẽ nu le eŋu.
Tomorrow can hope again.	Etsɔ ate ŋu akpɔ mɔ ake.

A school was badly damaged by fire.	Dzo gblẽ nu le suku aɖe ŋu vevie.

I am not sure how I am going to complete this project now.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi mawɔ awu dɔ sia nu fifia dzi o.
It was as if someone had fired a shot.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe ame aɖe da tu ene.

About a week later.	Anɔ abe kwasiɖa ɖeka ene megbe.

It’s not possible.	Manya wɔ o.
Always, he was satisfied.	Ɣesiaɣi la, eƒe dzi dze eme.

That’s what everybody had.	Emae nye nusi nɔ amesiame si.
This is a great house waiting for someone to do.	Esia nye aƒe gã aɖe si le lalam be ame aɖe nawɔ.
Maybe he made a mistake.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ vodada.
I just can’t do it.	Ðeko nyemate ŋui o.

There is no place like home.	Teƒe aɖeke meli abe aƒe ene o.

Imagine if that person didn’t care.	Bu eŋu kpɔ nenye be ame ma metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
There are only two ways.	Mɔ eve koe li.
Somehow it seems unimportant so far.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, edze abe ɖe mele vevie o ene vaseɖe fifia.

A large sea.	Ƒu gã aɖe.
If we are here, we are here.	Ne míele afisia la, ke míele afisia.
Just do your job.	Wò dɔ koe wɔ.
That always annoyed him.	Nya ma doa dziku nɛ ɣesiaɣi.
His case is different.	Eƒe nya la to vovo.
He had a very good life.	Agbe nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ esi.
Throughout the year.	Le ƒe bliboa me.

Someone else will feel something.	Ame bubu aɖe ase nane le eɖokui me.
But he didn’t get any.	Gake mexɔ ɖeke o.
This is right on the money.	Esia sɔ le ga la dzi.
But no one knows.	Gake ame aɖeke menya o.
Go, but be careful.	Yi, gake kpɔ nyuie.
I don’t know what to do from here.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso afisia o.
But what if that was me.	Gake ne nyee nye ema ya ɖe.

They were very pleased.	Edzɔ dzi na wo ŋutɔ.
Maybe he had a hard day.	Ðewohĩ ŋkeke sesẽ aɖe va edzi nɛ kpɔ.
He was satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme.

A little while passed.	Ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe va yi.

Things are being done differently there.	Wole nuwo wɔm le mɔ bubu nu le afima.
In some ways, this is true.	Le mɔ aɖewo nu la, esia nye nyateƒe.
I had a name for myself.	Ŋkɔ aɖe nɔ asinye.
This time it’s not too late.	Fifia ya metsi megbe akpa o.
I’m not going to do this.	Nyemele esia wɔ ge o.
Perhaps he fell.	Ðewohĩ edze anyi.
You can do anything else.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
There is no work to be done.	Dɔ aɖeke meli woawɔ o.
But everything is different between us now.	Gake nusianu to vovo le mía dome fifia.
Something else seemed odd.	Nu bubu aɖe hã dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ene.
There was also a car	Ʋu aɖe hã nɔ .

However, this is not true.	Ke hã, esia menye nyateƒe o.

This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That was the final straw.	Emae nye gbe mamlɛtɔ.
Think about what you are doing.	Bu nu si wɔm nèle ŋu kpɔ.
Nothing is illegal.	Naneke meli si ŋu se meɖe mɔ ɖo o.

Everyone has them.	Wo le amesiame si.

Look what they are doing there.	Kpɔ nusi wɔm wole le afima ɖa.
A car became easy for them.	Ʋu aɖe va nɔ bɔbɔe na wo.
Something about him just struck me.	Ðeko nane si le eŋu la ƒo ɖe ŋunye.
Many factors play a role.	Nu geɖe wɔa akpa aɖe.

Quick, go ahead!	Kaba, yi ŋgɔ!
He could have, but he didn’t.	Ate ŋu awɔe hafi, gake mewɔe nenema o.
Everything was in order.	Nusianu nɔ ɖoɖo nu.

But few people do this.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔa esia.
Maybe it was someone who.	Ðewohĩ enye ame aɖe si.
We know about it now though.	Míenya nu tso eŋu fifia gake.
Only one shot.	Tu ɖeka koe.
He got really sick afterwards.	Edze dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ le esia megbe.

But not cars like this.	Gake menye ʋu siwo le abe esia ene o.

Throughout the summer season.	Le dzomeŋɔli ƒe ɣeyiɣi bliboa me.

A fire destroyed our house.	Dzo aɖe gblẽ nu le míaƒe aƒea ŋu.

This is a bad strategy.	Esia nye aɖaŋu gbegblẽ aɖe.
But he has no neck.	Gake kɔ mele eya ya me o.
He wasn’t a good person at all.	Menye ame nyui aɖeke kura o.
When you are tired, look up and look!	Ne ɖeɖi te ŋuwò la, fɔ mo dzi eye kpɔ ɖa!
Treat a man like just another kid.	Kpɔ ŋutsu aɖe gbɔ abe ɖevi bubu aɖe ko ene.
And so did he.	Eye eya hã.

Tonight will be wonderful.	Zã sia anyo ŋutɔ.
I really deserve it.	Medze nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Everything will be in order.	Nusianu anɔ ɖoɖo nu.
That is the plain truth.	Emae nye nyateƒe si me kɔ la.
I can’t believe how well everything is going for you.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ alesi nusianu le edzi yim nyuie na wò la dzi ase o.
We can’t go without water.	Míate ŋu ayi tsi manɔmee o.
It’s a long job.	Enye dɔ didi.
No one wants this stuff.	Ame aɖeke medi nu sia o.
You can save them.	Àte ŋu axɔ na wo.
Again, the same thing.	Azɔ hã, nu ma ke.
The night was very hot.	Zã la me xɔ dzo ŋutɔ.
I better have something’.	Anyo wu be nane nanɔ asinye’.
I couldn’t quite work.	Nyemete ŋu wɔa dɔ tututu o.
Each side has to do the same thing.	Ele be akpa ɖesiaɖe nawɔ nu ɖeka.
Only the first one.	Gbãtɔ koe.
These books were popular for many years.	Agbalẽ siawo xɔ ŋkɔ ƒe geɖe.
I couldn’t see his face.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ eƒe mo o.
We are not doing anything illegal.	Míele naneke wɔm si mele se nu o.
What happened is interesting.	Nusi dzɔ la doa dzidzɔ na ame.
He could tell her this.	Ate ŋu agblɔ nya sia nɛ.
I just know some things you obviously don’t.	Ðeko menya nu aɖewo siwo edze ƒã be mènya o.
I could get along with everyone and everything.	Mete ŋu nɔa anyi kple amesiame kple nusianu.
He didn’t have skills he couldn’t prove.	Aɖaŋu siwo mate ŋu aɖo kpe edzi o la menɔ esi o.
She liked that guy.	Ŋutsu ma ƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
It is impossible	Manya wɔ o .
And it is, really.	Eye ele nenema, le nyateƒe me.
This could be the new normal.	Esia ate ŋu anye nu yeye si sɔ.
Give him more time.	Na ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu nɛ.
If you can find one.	Ne àte ŋu ake ɖe ɖeka ŋu.
I like to eat.	Nuɖuɖu dzɔa dzi nam.
This car is nearly new.	Ʋu sia nye yeye kloe.
Get out of there.	Do go tso afima.
He is here tonight.	Ele afisia le zã sia me.
In the nane.	Wɔ nane.
Tomorrow morning, kid.	Etsɔ ŋdi, ɖevi.
That's not what's bothering me.	Menye nu ma le fu ɖem nam o.
Alcohol will contribute to the reality.	Aha sesẽ akpe asi ɖe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si le edzi yim ŋu.
It won’t be easy at all, but it will eventually happen.	Manɔ bɔbɔe kura o, gake ava eme mlɔeba.
Money helped, but he wasn’t the only one.	Ga kpe ɖe eŋu, gake menye eya ɖeka koe o.
I have to do this for everyone.	Ele be mawɔ esia na amesiame.
Part of me doesn’t really care.	Nye akpa aɖe metsɔ ɖeke le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
It still makes no sense.	Susu aɖeke mele eme kokoko o.
That was what was in it.	Emae nye nusi nɔ eme.
See how you can join him.	Kpɔ ale si nàwɔ awɔ ɖeka kplii la ɖa.
I want to have a job.	Medi be dɔ aɖe nanɔ asinye.
I think this is true.	Mesusu be esia nye nyateƒe.
We need to have that.	Ele be ema nanɔ mía si.
But he certainly would anyway.	Gake awɔe nenema godoo le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I have done it so many times.	Mewɔe zi geɖe ŋutɔ.
He was always a different man.	Enye ŋutsu aɖe si to vovo ɣesiaɣi.
It will always be a part of you.	Anye wò akpa aɖe ɣesiaɣi.
Two thousand a year.	Akpe eve ƒe sia ƒe.
These books are not in order.	Agbalẽ siawo mele ɖoɖo nu o.
Believe in me.	Xɔ dzinye se.
He was a great man.	Ame gã aɖee wònye.
I have plenty of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe le asinye.
I want no part in that.	Medi be akpa aɖeke manɔ ema me o.
Maybe I’m the only one.	Ðewohĩ nye ɖeka koe.
Also consider how much this project will cost you.	Kpɔ ga si dɔ sia axɔ na wò hã ɖa.
Everyone is different.	Ame sia ame to vovo.
I don’t know which side won.	Nyemenya akpa si ɖu dzi o.
I need a little blood.	Mehiã ʋu vi aɖe.
I'm just on a project.	Ðeko mele dɔ aɖe dzi.
He fell flat on his face.	Edze anyi ɖe mo nɛ.
For the coming times.	Na ɣeyiɣi siwo gbɔna.
Write down everything that comes to mind.	Ŋlɔ nusianu si va susu me na wò la ɖi.
Not by a long shot.	Menye to tu didi aɖe dzi o.
Every day is on it.	Gbe sia gbe le edzi.
I know he can do it.	Menya be ate ŋui.
I came to grow up.	Meva tsi.
But on the other hand, another has emerged.	Gake le go bubu me la, bubu aɖe hã do mo ɖa.
And you have no idea.	Eye susu aɖeke mele asiwò o.
That’s it, actually.	Emae nye ema, le nyateƒe me.
I am convinced of that.	Meka ɖe nya ma dzi.
Work quickly now.	Wɔ dɔ kaba fifia.
If you have any questions, give you a call.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò la, ƒo ka na wò.
But he couldn’t wait.	Gake mete ŋu nɔ lalam o.
Before him.	Do ŋgɔ nɛ.
The case is different.	Nya la to vovo.
Maybe someone would have taken a little chance with it.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe tsɔ mɔnukpɔkpɔ vi aɖe ɖe eŋu hafi.
Why is it him? 	Nukatae wònye eya?
While you are alive, believe in life.	Esi nèle agbe la, xɔ agbe dzi se.
He made them great.	Ewɔ wo gã ŋutɔ.
I'll find one.	Makpɔ ɖeka.
Really?	Nyateƒea?
It would be a great thing.	Anye nu gã aɖe.
I have nothing against him.	Naneke mele asinye ɖe eŋu o.
But nothing seems to be working.	Gake edze abe naneke mele dɔ wɔm o ene.
No one else can do it.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu awɔe o.
I don’t know what happened.	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ o.
I don’t know anything, I’m really too old.	Menya naneke o, le nyateƒe me la, metsi akpa.
I do this often.	Mewɔa esia zi geɖe.
Right now it doesn’t seem important to me.	Fifia la, edze nam be mele vevie o.
People definitely talk a lot.	Amewo ƒoa nu geɖe godoo.
We hope you enjoy it.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò.
It is not obvious at all.	Medze ƒã kura o.
I’m sure you have your mind on it.	Meka ɖe edzi be wò susu le eŋu.
They have a chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ le wo si.
Say what you have to say.	Gblɔ nya si wòle be nàgblɔ.
No one can take that away from him.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ ema le esi o.
I responded with that thought.	Metsɔ susu ma ɖo eŋu.
It’s not for you.	Menye na wòe wòle o.
I'm just there as .	Ðeko mele afima abe .
It will do it on its own.	Awɔe le eɖokui si.
A week is just a week.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka koe nye kwasiɖa ɖeka.
It’s finding a good home.	Enye aƒe nyui aɖe didi.
I couldn’t get started.	Nyemete ŋu dze egɔme o.
I know myself.	Menya ɖokuinye.
I missed mine.	Nye tɔ to ŋunye.
I don’t want to meet them.	Nyemedi be mado go wo o.
But this is really, really great.	Gake esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The king finally arrived.	Fia va ɖo mlɔeba.
Understand that now.	Se nya ma gɔme fifia.
That went ahead for me.	Ema yi ŋgɔ nam.
Who knows what happened.	Amekae nya nusi dzɔ.
As if nothing bothered him.	Abe ɖe naneke meɖe fu nɛ o ene.
People are still looking after him.	Amewo gakpɔtɔ le edzi kpɔm.
We can’t go anywhere today.	Míate ŋu ayi afi aɖeke egbea o.
It’s not very big.	Menye gã ŋutɔ o.
It is our duty to work.	Enye míaƒe dɔ be míawɔ dɔ.
There was nothing there.	Naneke menɔ afima o.
He still had the gun.	Tu la gakpɔtɔ nɔ esi.
He doesn’t remember that.	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi o.
This is a difficult situation.	Esia nye nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe.
It won’t be easy.	Manɔ bɔbɔe o.
I couldn’t stand it at home.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu le aƒeme o.
My mind was racing.	Nye susu nɔ du dzi.
And we certainly are.	Eye míele nenema godoo.
There is salt and sand.	Dze kple ke le afi ma.
I hope it will be from next year.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be anye tso ƒe si gbɔna me.
That’s why he’s here.	Esia tae wòle afisia ɖo.
As if that meant anything.	Abe ɖe ema fia nane ene.
I knew it would be minimal.	Menya be anye nu sue aɖe ko.
No one wanted him.	Ame aɖeke medi nɛ o.
We have a lot to do.	Nu geɖe le mía si míawɔ.
Let me tell you it is not working.	Mina magblɔ na mi be mele dɔ wɔm o.
You can’t do everything at once.	Màte ŋu awɔ nusianu zi ɖeka o.
The matter ends there.	Nya la wu enu le afima.
So everything becomes more alive for me.	Ale nusianu va nɔa agbe nam wu.
I want that kind of life.	Medi agbe ma ƒomevi.
Things didn’t go according to plan.	Nuwo meva yi ɖe ɖoɖo nu o.
Somewhere far away.	Le afi aɖe si didi tso afima gbɔ.
We can handle this.	Míate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ.
Not sure if he would.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be awɔe nenema o.
That’s not what we’re doing right now.	Menye nu ma wɔm míele fifia o.
Please establish this.	Taflatse, ɖo esia anyi.
Actually, that is very difficult.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I'm being pretty good at this.	Mele nu ƒom nyuie ŋutɔ le esia me.
We had help.	Kpekpeɖeŋu nɔ mía si.
People were running through the grass.	Amewo nɔ du dzi to gbe te.
It would be better than that.	Anyo wu nenema.
The police are amazing.	Kpovitɔwo wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He was very satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme ŋutɔ.
But you can’t just come to his house at this hour.	Gake màte ŋu ava eƒe aƒeme le gaƒoƒo sia me ko o.
You can know that.	Àte ŋu anya nya ma.
Not that he could do much.	Menye ɖe wòate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe o.
I can’t witness this.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia teƒe o.
With their child inside.	Esi wo vi la le eme.
He has that face too.	Mo ma hã le esi.
He couldn't do it.	Mete ŋui o.
It's just like that and.	Ðeko wòle nenema eye.
Otherwise, it will be.	Ne menye nenema o la, anye nenema.
Today had been a mistake, a big mistake.	Egbea nye vodada tsã, enye vodada gã aɖe.
He doesn’t remember what happened.	Meɖo ŋku nusi dzɔ dzi o.
Finally, relax.	Mlɔeba la, ɖe dzi ɖi.
I don’t think all is well.	Nyemesusu be nuwo katã le edzi yim o.
A man is working hard.	Ŋutsu aɖe le dɔ wɔm sesĩe.
The mountain is a mountain.	To la nye to aɖe.
But more often now too.	Gake zi geɖe wu fifia hã.
My life, my heart.	Nye agbe, nye dzi.
I think it’s a very good thing.	Mesusu be enye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
However, it is not necessary.	Ke hã, mehiã o.
Anyone with the same problem.	Ame sia ame si ŋu kuxi ma ke le.
It was so much fun for us.	Edzɔ dzi na mí ale gbegbe.
He didn’t say a word the whole time.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke le ɣeyiɣi bliboa me o.
A great little thing.	Nu sue aɖe gã aɖe.
I know, I don’t know either.	Menya, nye hã nyemenya o.
Not that I’ve ever tried.	Menye ɖe medze agbagba kpɔ o.
He didn’t believe them.	Mexɔ wo dzi se o.
Everything is brand new.	Nusianu nye nu yeye kura.
He was seriously ill.	Edze dɔ vevie.
A lot can happen at this point.	Nu geɖe ate ŋu adzɔ le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
It will be very expensive.	Axɔ asi ŋutɔ.
You can see that like this.	Àte ŋu akpɔ ema ale.
For one of them.	Na wo dometɔ ɖeka.
I want them to be implemented.	Medi be woawɔ wo dzi.
No one seems to have done that.	Edze abe ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o ene.
And a child in the background.	Eye ɖevi aɖe le megbe.
And he doesn’t know if he’s right.	Eye menya nenye be ewɔ nu nyui o.
His life was at least similar to that.	Eƒe agbe ya teti sɔ kple ema.
It was another day.	Enye ŋkeke bubu aɖe.
I thought maybe.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ.
There are many things we don’t know.	Nu geɖe li siwo míenya o.
He could never imagine such a bad reputation.	Mate ŋu akpɔ ŋkɔ gbegblẽ alea le susu me gbeɖe o.
Look for us in a week.	Di mí le kwasiɖa ɖeka megbe.
It was a lot of support from them.	Enye kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe tso wo gbɔ.
He was having trouble finding a job.	Dɔ didi nɔ fu ɖem nɛ.
You for that.	Wò ɖe ema ta.
But only for a few days.	Gake ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe.
No one touched him.	Ame aɖeke meka asi eŋu o.
Who is in charge of this process?	Amekae kpɔa ɖoɖo sia dzi?
I can't 'explain it.	Nyemate ŋu 'ɖe eme o.
You’re the one.	Wòe nye wò.
We can hear everything.	Míate ŋu ase nusianu.
I am really like that.	Nyee nye nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I could think of one way.	Mete ŋu bu mɔ ɖeka ŋu.
But the opposite happened.	Gake nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ.
It will never work.	Mawɔ dɔ gbeɖe o.
I have nothing else to do, really.	Naneke megale asinye mawɔ o, le nyateƒe me.
I asked so many questions that the teacher couldn’t stand me	Mebia nya geɖe ale gbegbe be nufiala la mete ŋu do dzi nam o
Let me try it.	Mina mate kpɔ.
It was a waste of time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
This work will ultimately benefit us.	Dɔ sia aɖe vi na mí mlɔeba.
Thousands of lives were lost.	Ame akpe geɖe ƒe agbe bu.
You can keep going.	Àte ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim.
Same thing here.	Nu ɖeka ma ke le afisia hã.
I hope this is better.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia anyo wu.
I need that kind of machine.	Mehiã mɔ̃ ma ƒomevi.
He can take care of himself.	Ate ŋu akpɔ eɖokui dzi.
Smoke came out of his room.	Dzudzɔ do tso eƒe xɔ me.
This seems to be appropriate.	Edze abe esia sɔ ene.
Do what you want.	Wɔ nu si nèdi.
Which is of course what these two are.	Nusi nye nusi ame eve siawo nye ya.
Up until last week, it was working fine.	Vaseɖe kwasiɖa si va yi me la, ele dɔ wɔm nyuie.
His mouth fell off.	Eƒe nu dze anyi.
But many of them did not understand.	Gake wo dometɔ geɖe mese egɔme o.
Actually, quite a bit of it.	Le nyateƒe me la, eƒe akpa aɖe ŋutɔ.
And there was no one else there.	Eye ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afi ma o.
We know this day will come.	Míenya be ŋkeke sia ava.
People need money quickly for all sorts of valid reasons.	Amewo hiã ga kaba le susu ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe si sɔ ta.
Just not today.	Ðeko menye egbea o.
I think that life.	Mesusu be agbe ma.
It could be his imagination.	Ate ŋu anye eƒe susu me nu.
We hope you can help.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
Two men died.	Ŋutsu eve ku.
I hope you like them!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wo adzɔ dzi na wò!.
I like his state of mind.	Eƒe susu ƒe nɔnɔme dze ŋunye.
He could barely contain himself now at all.	Mete ŋu lé eɖokui ɖe te fifia kura kura o.
But you’re not alone in the market.	Gake menye wò ɖeka koe le asi me o.
Like the last time.	Abe zi mamlɛtɔ ene.
And this is the same thing.	Eye esia hã nye nu ɖeka ma ke.
Things were going very well.	Nuwo nɔ edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔ.
There is only one reason behind this.	Susu ɖeka koe le megbe na esia.
Maybe you can hope.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu akpɔ mɔ.
It’s playing someone else’s part.	Enye ame bubu ƒe akpa aɖe wɔwɔ.
He looked better than he had in years.	Edze nyuie wu alesi wònɔ le ƒe geɖe me.
I enjoy doing things.	Nuwo wɔwɔ dzɔa dzi nam.
He had a job to do.	Dɔ nɔ esi wòawɔ.
And he has nothing else.	Eye nu bubu aɖeke mele esi o.
This is quite a lot.	Esia sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
I don’t know what to do.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
It's going on all the time.	Ele edzi yim ɣesiaɣi.
He seems to have made a home.	Edze abe ewɔ aƒe ene.
That can be very interesting.	Ema ate ŋu ado dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
It might work and it might not.	Ðewohĩ awɔ dɔ eye ɖewohĩ mawɔ dɔ o.
You are my king.	Wòe nye nye fia.
Trust me, you know.	Ka ɖe dzinye.
It’s not my type.	Menye nye ƒomevi o.
Try with this one.	Te kpɔ kple esia.
Thank you so much for any help.	Akpe geɖe na mi ɖe kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe ta.
He had something in every hand.	Nane nɔ esi le asi ɖesiaɖe me.
This is a very flammable material.	Esia nye nusi ate ŋu axɔ dzo ŋutɔ.
It can happen here.	Ate ŋu adzɔ le afisia.
He was more comfortable.	Eƒe dzi dze eme wu.
It certainly is.	Ele nenema godoo.
I came here for one reason and one reason only.	Susu ɖeka kple susu ɖeka koe meva afisia ɖo.
He was a very nice guy.	Enye ame nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I do this myself once in a while.	Nye ŋutɔ mewɔa esia zi ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi aɖewo me.
There are books on that.	Agbalẽ aɖewo li siwo ku ɖe ema ŋu.
Which is really interesting to me.	Nusi doa dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There was a reason, too.	Susu aɖe hã nɔ eme.
That appeals to him.	Ema dzɔa dzi nɛ.
Or maybe he can.	Alo ɖewohĩ ate ŋui.
Give what you want most.	Na nusi dim nèle wu.
Before you act, think carefully.	Hafi nàwɔ ɖe edzi la, bu eŋu nyuie.
But each day was just a little bit easier.	Gake ŋkeke ɖesiaɖe nɔ bɔbɔe vie ko.
There is no one way that works best for everyone.	Mɔ ɖeka aɖeke meli si awɔ dɔ nyuie wu na amesiame o.
He wasn’t surprised at all.	Mewɔ nuku nɛ kura o.
It’s familiar to me.	Enye nusi menya nyuie nam.
Explain it to him.	Ðe eme nɛ.
There is no one else like him.	Ame bubu aɖeke meli si le abe eya ene o.
It’s a no-brainer.	Enye nusi me susu mele o.
He seemed to like her too.	Edze abe eya hã ƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ene.
That’s why he’s here.	Esia tae wòle afisia ɖo.
You can’t do anything.	Màte ŋu awɔ naneke o.
I couldn’t get closer.	Nyemete ŋu te ɖe eŋu o.
Now blood came out of his mouth.	Azɔ ʋu la do tso eƒe nu me.
No one else could understand a word.	Ame bubu aɖeke mete ŋu se nya aɖeke gɔme o.
No one expected this outcome.	Ame aɖeke menɔ mɔ kpɔm be nu sia ado tso eme o.
It will work, too.	Eya hã awɔ dɔ.
It was just so small.	Ðeko wònɔ sue ale gbegbe.
It was a wonderful thing.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But there is one exception.	Gake ɖeka aɖe hã li si to vovo.
It’s probably a very small thing.	Anɔ eme be enye nu sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can know this.	Mate ŋu anya esia.
He would not allow this to happen to him.	Maɖe mɔ woawɔ nu sia ɖe eŋu o.
A small voice broke his thoughts.	Gbe sue aɖe gblẽ eƒe susu me.
He was the only one who survived.	Eya ɖeka koe tsi agbe.
About a man who decided to live.	Ŋutsu aɖe si ɖoe be yeanɔ agbe la ŋu.
I will also see others who were present.	Makpɔ ame bubu siwo nɔ anyi hã.
But this will work.	Gake esia awɔ dɔ.
It will take some time.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
But he didn’t try hard.	Gake medze agbagba vevie o.
Put that aside.	Tsɔ nya ma da ɖe vovo.
I doubt if they are.	Meke ɖi nenye be wole edzi.
Being single, she had very little money.	Esi wònye tre ta la, ga sue aɖe koe nɔ esi.
It is the opposite.	Enye nusi to vovo na ema.
I can’t do anything about it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso eŋu o.
And in it,	Eye le eme la, .
He must have lost at least two stones.	Anɔ eme be kpe eve ya teti bu nɛ.
He could never explain it properly.	Mete ŋu ɖe eme nɛ nyuie gbeɖe o.
There may be another.	Bubu ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
For something as simple as this.	Le nane si le bɔbɔe abe esia ene ta.
There are many of us.	Mía dometɔ geɖe li.
Or who spoke to him, for that matter.	Alo amesi ƒo nu nɛ, le nya ma ta.
Let me be clear about this.	Mina magblɔ nya sia na mi nyuie.
They have two children.	Vi eve le wo si.
But you seem to know that.	Gake edze abe ènya ema ene.
Take this gun with you.	Tsɔ tu sia ɖe asi.
We are all on the same side.	Mí katã míele akpa ɖeka dzi.
His character is bad.	Eƒe nɔnɔme gblẽ.
I, of course, am interested in that.	Nye ya, metsɔ ɖe le ema me ya.
The people who live here will stay here.	Ame siwo le afisia la anɔ afisia.
Everyone knows who you are.	Ame sia ame nya amesi nènye.
It cannot exist.	Mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
This project has the following structure.	Dɔ sia ƒe ɖoɖo si gbɔna la le esi.
I am not that person.	Menye nyee nye ame ma o.
I am not happy with this arrangement.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe ɖoɖo sia ŋu o.
That was just a few weeks ago.	Kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo koe nye ema va yi.
This is important for the following reasons.	Esia le vevie le susu siwo gbɔna ta.
Tell him what happened.	Gblɔ nusi dzɔ nɛ.
And a job is a job.	Eye dɔ aɖe nye dɔ.
It’s worth the money!.	Edze na ga la!.
He looks a lot like you.	Edze abe wò ene ŋutɔ.
Life is so beautiful!	Agbe nya kpɔ ŋutɔ!
Not that he was expecting any.	Menye ɖe wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na ɖeke o.
I don't understand.	Nyemese egɔme o.
And it was a huge mistake.	Eye vodada gã aɖee wònye.
But I was very happy.	Gake mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
You can’t understand it, now.	Màte ŋu ase egɔme o, fifia.
Apparently, neither did he.	Edze abe eya hã mewɔe nenema o ene.
I am not one of them.	Menye wo dometɔ ɖekae menye o.
I hope it doesn’t, though.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mawɔe nenema o, gake.
Maybe more than that.	Ðewohĩ nusi wu ema.
It’s just not that simple.	Ðeko mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
Turn the object inside out.	Trɔ nusi le eme la ɖe eme.
Even if people don’t believe me, it’s true.	Ne amewo mexɔ dzinye se o hã la, enye nyateƒe.
I can’t remember anything.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku naneke dzi o.

Get in there.	Ge ɖe afima.
I decided to go to the house.	Meɖoe be mayi aƒea me.
Someone else entirely.	Ame bubu kura.
Where some have disappeared.	Afisi ame aɖewo bu le.
I am still in it.	Megale eme kokoko.
I couldn’t do without it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe ema manɔmee o.
Two more nights.	Zã eve bubu.
He just didn’t trust me.	Ðeko meka ɖe dzinye o.
There was so much that had to be done.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi siwo wòle be woawɔ kpɔ.
It could be the opposite.	Ate ŋu anye nusi to vovo na ema.
They all turned to him.	Wo katã trɔ ɖe eŋu.
Suitable.	Si nyo.
But he's not doing any of that here.	Gake mele ema dometɔ aɖeke wɔm le afisia o.
Maybe there were some who did.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖewo nɔ anyi siwo wɔe nenema.
Please, one meal.	Meɖe kuku, nuɖuɖu ɖeka.
No one can do this job on behalf of someone else.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ dɔ sia ɖe ame bubu teƒe o.
He had a child with him.	Vi aɖe nɔ esi kplii.
He was seriously ill.	Edze dɔ vevie.
They were all there.	Wo katã nɔ afima.
He had a gun in his hand.	Tu nɔ esi le esi.
No one else did that.	Ame bubu aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
Actually, I am not.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemele nenema o.
In my house.	Le nye aƒeme.
He who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.	Ame si mewɔ vodada kpɔ o la mete nu yeye aɖeke kpɔ o.
He was never able to go to summer school.	Mete ŋu yi dzomeŋɔli suku gbeɖe o.
Otherwise, you may not be able to see much.	Ne menye nenema o la, ɖewohĩ màte ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe o.
But everything looked good, everything looked good.	Gake nusianu dze nyuie, nusianu dze nyuie.
Maybe he was interested.	Ðewohĩ etsɔ ɖe le eme.
Turn your back on them.	Trɔ megbe de wo.
All the people in the car died.	Ame siwo katã nɔ ʋua me la ku.
This is a great market in itself.	Esia nye asi gã aɖe le eɖokui si.
No one else was there.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afima o.
I am not sure how long this will take.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be ɣeyiɣi didi kae esia axɔ o.
I couldn’t remember happiness.	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku dzidzɔ dzi o.
In a way, it is.	Le mɔ aɖe nu.
That’s what they’re looking for.	Emae nye nusi dim wole.
If he is interested, he can find it.	Ne etsɔ ɖe le eme la, ate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu.
Honestly, I’m not sure.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
I am still there.	Megale afima kokoko.
I really wanted to try them.	Medi vevie be mate wo kpɔ.
Which was probably my first mistake.	Nusi anya nye nye vodada gbãtɔ.
From the same day.	Tso ŋkeke ɖeka dzi.
You can be a happy, content person.	Àte ŋu anye ame si kpɔa dzidzɔ, si ƒe dzi dze eme.
Some songs just can’t happen.	Ðeko ha aɖewo mate ŋu adzɔ o.
There was no one here.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afisia o.
But in reality, things are quite different.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nuwo to vovo kura.
He was a good guy.	Ame nyui aɖee wònye.
That’s so bad.	Ema gblẽ ale gbegbe.
This can take some time, weeks or more.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe, kwasiɖa alo esi wu nenema.
Where no one can see.	Afisi ame aɖeke mate ŋu akpɔ nu le o.
Report to them.	Ka nya ta na wo.
I had enough to go on.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ nɔ asinye be mayi edzi.
I'm starting to.	Mele egɔme dzem be.
We can achieve this.	Míate ŋu aɖo esia gbɔ.
I am going this way.	Mele mɔ sia dzi yim.
Some people support this plan.	Ame aɖewo da asi ɖe ɖoɖo sia dzi.
Very many good things.	Nu nyui geɖe ŋutɔ.
He did a good job of it.	Ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe tso eŋu.
You have to have that.	Ele be ema nanɔ asiwò.
He would kill himself, he would kill us all.	Awu eɖokui, awu mí katã.
Everything will help you.	Nusianu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
But he couldn’t, not yet.	Gake mete ŋui o, menye haɖe o.
Some not so much.	Ame aɖewo menye nenema gbegbe o.
Otherwise, it doesn’t matter.	Ne menye nenema o la, mehiã o.
Really anything but.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusianu gake.
It’s something else.	Enye nu bubu aɖe.
He’s on his way.	Edze mɔ.
Changed his life.	Trɔ eƒe agbe.
This is a very effective strategy.	Esia nye aɖaŋu aɖe si wɔa dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
Take a closer look at that.	Lé ŋku ɖe nya ma ŋu nyuie wu.
Or my job.	Alo nye dɔ.
If he doesn’t see us, he’ll call.	Ne mekpɔ mí o la, aƒo ka.
I am interested in all kinds of food.	Metsɔ ɖe le nuɖuɖu ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe me.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
No one knows where he is.	Ame aɖeke menya afi si wòle o.
Watch out for potholes on this road.	Kpɔ nyuie le do siwo le mɔ sia dzi ŋu.
Here, each day is like the one before.	Le afisia la, ŋkeke ɖesiaɖe le abe esi nɔ anyi do ŋgɔ ene.
This works well.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie.
Keep this in mind.	Lé esia ɖe dzi me.
I have never been happy.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ kpɔ o.
It will help you.	Akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I can find them.	Mate ŋu ake ɖe wo ŋu.
It’s a big chunk of people.	Enye amewo ƒe akpa gã aɖe.
I don’t know which one it is.	Nyemenya esi nye o.
This has never happened to us.	Esia medze mía dzi kpɔ o.
It’s really just a lake.	Le nyateƒe me la, ta aɖe koe wònye.
We could have been anywhere.	Míate ŋu anɔ afi sia afi hafi.
Think about that one.	Bu ɖeka ma ŋu.
I wasn’t happy with it.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu o.
You can easily see this for yourself.	Wò ŋutɔ àte ŋu akpɔ esia bɔbɔe.
I felt very confident.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
So did everyone else.	Nenema ke ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã wɔe.
But his work is not without its difficulties.	Gake menye nu sesẽ aɖeke mele eƒe dɔa me o.
It’s not really that hard.	Menye nu sesẽ nenema gbegbe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
In fact, it’s quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo kura na ema.
He doesn’t remember it fondly.	Meɖo ŋku edzi kple dzidzɔ o.
Also, ask me.	Azɔ hã, biam.
I wrote this post.	Nyee ŋlɔ nya sia.
Clearly, he may have made a mistake.	Edze ƒã be anya wɔ vodada.
These programs are being abandoned.	Wole asi ɖem le ɖoɖo siawo ŋu.
You have to tell him that.	Ele be nàgblɔ nya ma nɛ.
His face was so close.	Eƒe mo te ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe.
I did what was necessary.	Mewɔ nusi hiã.
That’s the one thing he won’t do.	Emae nye nu ɖeka si mawɔ o.
Which is the right thing to do.	Nukae nye nu si wòle be woawɔ.
It may take quite a while though.	Ðewohĩ axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ ya.
Tell him what he needs to do.	Gblɔ nu si wòle be wòawɔ nɛ.
I had another reason for coming.	Susu bubu aɖe hã nɔ asinye si tae meva ɖo.
I turned it off.	Metsi enu.
Be quick about it.	Wɔ kaba le eŋu.
It wasn’t hard for me.	Menye nu sesẽ nam o.
I made enough for two.	Mewɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ na ame eve.
Go to his house	Yi eƒe aƒeme .
Not much chance for that.	Menye mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe na ema o.
It never occurred to me to go out.	Meva susu me nam kpɔ be mado go o.
You are busy with less important things.	Vovo mele ŋuwò le nu siwo mele vevie nenema gbegbe o ŋu.
First aid is definitely needed.	Kpekpeɖeŋu gbãtɔ hiã godoo.
But, it happened to happen.	Gake, edzɔ be edzɔ.
They might have a week.	Ðewohĩ kwasiɖa ɖeka anɔ wo si.
Everything is still there, now.	Nusianu gakpɔtɔ li, fifia.
The one thing.	Nya ɖeka la.
He didn’t answer.	Meɖo eŋu o.
That would be quite a day.	Ema anye ŋkeke ɖeka ŋutɔ.
That way no one will see you.	To mɔ sia dzi la, ame aɖeke makpɔ wò o.
A king has married you.	Fia aɖe ɖe wò.
They have them there.	Wole wo si le afima.
Where do you live?	Afi kae wò aƒeme le?
A huge waste of money.	Ga gbegblẽ gã aɖe.
Can someone please do that.	Taflatse ɖe ame aɖe ate ŋu awɔe nenema.
Good morning, everyone.	Ŋdi nyui, amesiame.
There is some good stuff here.	Nu nyui aɖewo le afisia.
My dog ​​looked tired.	Nye avu dze abe ɖe ɖeɖi te eŋu ene.
A sword lodged in his jaw.	Yi aɖe ge ɖe eƒe aɖu me.
This also compares well.	Esia hã sɔ kple wo nɔewo nyuie.
It’s obvious on your face.	Edze ƒã le wò mo.
Why is that, of course.	Nukatae wòle nenema ya.
There could be two reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo ate ŋu anɔ esia ta.
No one else can either.	Ame bubu aɖeke hã mate ŋui o.
There’s no room for that here.	Teƒe aɖeke meli na ema le afisia o.
It’s the only time we can get together.	Eya koe nye ɣeyiɣi si me míate ŋu aƒo ƒu.
The only good thing I had was the car model.	Nu nyui ɖeka si nɔ asinye koe nye ʋu ƒe nɔnɔme.
Or a system.	Alo ɖoɖo aɖe.
It’s a pleasure to behold.	Enye dzidzɔ na ame.
To build.	Ku ake.
My gun is already in order.	Nye tu la le ɖoɖo nu xoxo.
Everything is a part.	Nusianu nye akpa aɖe.
He doesn’t seem to be the type.	Edze abe menye amesi ƒomevi wònye o ene.
But a problem arose very quickly.	Gake kuxi aɖe do mo ɖa kaba ŋutɔ.
I want to know everything about it.	Medi be manya nusianu tso eŋu.
Is that you?.	Wòe nye ema?.
It can happen to anyone at any time.	Ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe amesiame dzi le ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe me.
His life changed in	Eƒe agbe trɔ le .
An opportunity arose.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe do mo ɖa.
Dig into the issue carefully.	Ku nya la me nyuie.
We can talk about it.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu tso eŋu.
He didn’t seem worried.	Edze abe metsi dzi o ene.
You can usually do what you like.	Zi geɖe la, àte ŋu awɔ nu si dze ŋuwò.
Why, we can do anything.	Nukatae, míate ŋu awɔ nusianu.
A car crashes into a building.	Ʋu aɖe ge dze xɔ aɖe me.
The other is a good thing.	Bubu la nye nu nyui aɖe.
He will remember that for a very long time.	Aɖo ŋku nya ma dzi ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ.
Everyone out there knows this.	Amesiame si le afima nya nya sia.
We need to have help.	Ele be kpekpeɖeŋu nanɔ mía si.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.	Nu gbegblẽ, nu gbegblẽ, nu gbegblẽ.
There is very little fresh water	Tsi nyui sue aɖe koe li
Maybe we can figure this thing out together.	Ðewohĩ míate ŋu akpɔ nu sia gbɔ ɖekae.
That’s why he won’t.	Esia tae mawɔe nenema o ɖo.
But you will be very happy.	Gake adzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ.
Another happened.	Bubu dzɔ.
I would like to do it the same way.	Madi be mawɔe le mɔ ma ke nu.
It had some of my clothes in it.	Nye awu aɖewo nɔ eme.
Some of the work was easy.	Dɔa dometɔ aɖewo nɔ bɔbɔe.
But what awaits them will be as testing as ever.	Gake nusi le wo lalam la ado wo kpɔ abe tsã ene.
The police found nothing.	Kpovitɔwo mekpɔ naneke o.
He had no teeth.	Aɖu aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
I am, in a word, real.	Nyee nye, le nya ɖeka me la, ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t have a car.	Ʋu mele asinye o.
The annual meeting was more well attended than in	Ame geɖe va ƒe sia ƒe ƒe kpekpea wu le ƒe
There’s really only one person this can be.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame ɖeka koe li si esia ate ŋu anye.
It’s not just my job.	Menye nye dɔ koe o.
I don’t know anything.	Nyemenya naneke o.
It will be really annoying.	Ado dziku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Two hours later, it was all over.	Le gaƒoƒo eve megbe la, nusianu wu enu.
There were a few people in the car .	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ ʋua me .
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Which is also inexpensive.	Nusi hã mexɔ asi o.
And think about it.	Eye bu eŋu kpɔ.
It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
We all have to do our part.	Ele be mí katã míawɔ míaƒe akpa dzi.
But you can understand it.	Gake àte ŋu ase egɔme.
You know what that was like.	Ènya alesi ema nɔ.
It will do that.	Awɔe nenema.
Please speak louder.	Taflatse ƒo nu sesĩe wu.
I got one for you.	Mexɔ ɖeka na wò.
I just want a dog.	Ðeko medi be avu aɖe nanɔ asinye.
He doesn’t need one.	Mehiã ɖeka o.
My room was very small.	Nye xɔa nɔ sue ŋutɔ.
Everyone lent a hand.	Amesiame do asi na ame.
I will pray for you all every day.	Mado gbe ɖa ɖe mi katã ta gbe sia gbe.
I have to go to the gym.	Ele be mayi.
No one has more courage than you.	Ame aɖeke meli si dzi dzi le wu wò o.
That was exciting.	Ema do dzidzɔ na ame.
He just had it.	Ðeko wònɔ esi.
He never did it.	Mewɔe gbeɖe o.
But in another way, it was amazing.	Gake le mɔ bubu nu la, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It’s more than enough.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ wu.
But it doesn’t do that.	Gake mewɔa nu nenema o.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Maybe I can still happen.	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu adzɔ kokoko.
Get out of my car!	Do le nye ʋu me!
Show interest in them.	Tsɔ ɖe le eme na wo.
We know what happened, we know who did it.	Míenya nusi dzɔ, míenya amesi wɔe.
I think he is, too.	Mesusu be eya hã le nenema.
Here it wasn’t.	Le afisia la, menɔ anyi o.
I hope someone will let me know.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ame aɖe ana manya.
That’s his job.	Emae nye eƒe dɔ.
Arrived at the room.	Va ɖo xɔa me.
I will let myself out.	Maɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu ado go.
What could it be	Nukae ate ŋu anye
Take a look at your diet.	Lé ŋku ɖe wò nuɖuɖu ŋu.
There is really nothing to do.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke meli woawɔ o.
But it’s unlikely anyone will.	Gake anɔ eme be ame aɖeke mawɔe o.
Today, , there is a lot of money.	Egbea la, , ga geɖe li.
He will give you everything he has.	Ana nusianu si le esi la wò.
I think there is a mistake here.	Mesusu be vodada aɖe le afisia.
Maybe that could work.	Ðewohĩ ema ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
It was a minor mistake.	Vodada sue aɖee wònye.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!.	Akpe na wò, akpe na wò, akpe na wò!.
People in the house can’t stay in the house.	Ame siwo le aƒea me mate ŋu anɔ aƒea me o.
I know that wasn’t easy.	Menya be ema menɔ bɔbɔe o.
But it’s not necessarily necessary.	Gake mehiã kokoko o.
You shouldn’t make the same mistake.	Mele be nàwɔ vodada ma ke o.
In this case, .	Le nɔnɔme sia me la, .
And the present case.	Eye nya si li fifia hã.
There is nothing more than that.	Naneke meli wu ema o.
But they are there.	Gake wole afima.
We can assist you in this process.	Míate ŋu akpe asi ɖe ŋuwò le dɔ sia wɔwɔ me.
I'm not trying to do it.	Menye ɖe mele agbagba dzem be mawɔe o.
The whole thing was amazing.	Nu bliboa wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That was just a job for him.	Dɔ aɖe koe ema nye nɛ.
He was just that kind of guy.	Ŋutsu ma ƒomevi koe wònye.
A lot of things don’t work as well as they used to.	Nu geɖe mewɔa dɔ nyuie abe tsã ene o.
That he was involved.	Be eya hã nɔ eme.
It wasn’t me though.	Menye nyee o ke hã.
Now that is an expensive part of the job.	Fifia ema nye dɔa ƒe akpa aɖe si xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I want to stay here.	Medi be manɔ afisia.
It’s a pretty big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
He saved them.	Eya ɖe wo ŋu.
I don’t know who he is.	Nyemenya amesi wònye o.
I can fight anyone.	Mate ŋu awɔ avu kple ame sia ame.
I don’t know what he’s doing.	Nyemenya nusi wɔm wòle o.
He shouldn’t have done that either.	Mele be wòawɔ nenema hã hafi o.
I don’t quite understand it myself.	Nye ŋutɔ nyemese egɔme nyuie o.
This last factor is very important.	Nu mamlɛtɔ sia le vevie ŋutɔ.
In the background.	Le megbe la.
But that is impossible.	Gake ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I have them, but not without a lot of work.	Wo le asinye, gake menye dɔ geɖe manɔmee o.
I couldn’t run.	Nyemete ŋu ƒu du o.
In fact, it’s amazing.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
The truth remains firm.	Nyateƒea gakpɔtɔ li ke.
Think about it for real.	Bu eŋu kpɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There was nothing wrong.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
What works for one person may not work for another.	Ðewohĩ nusi wɔa dɔ na ame ɖeka mawɔ dɔ na ame bubu o.
Some words here are needed.	Nya aɖewo le afisia hiã.
He can give up.	Ate ŋu ana ta.
It’s important to me.	Ele vevie nam.
There was something else.	Nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
However, we all know you never, ever know.	Ke hã, mí katã míenya be mènya gbeɖe o, gbeɖe o.
Pass them now we must.	To wo ŋu fifia ele be míawɔ.
I tried to do that in two ways.	Medze agbagba be mawɔ ema le mɔ eve nu.
You’re at home.	Èle aƒeme.
It’s not just my fault.	Menye nye vodada koe wònye o.
In fact, it is the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo na emae.
I got there too late.	Metsi megbe akpa va ɖo afima.
Do something sensible.	Wɔ nane si me susu le.
Two teeth, too.	Aɖu eve hã.
But he is not ready for the job.	Gake mele klalo na dɔa o.
I doubt that’s all.	Meke ɖi be ema koe nye ema.
This is so appropriate.	Esia sɔ ale gbegbe.
What a year it is.	Ƒe kae nye si.
There was a good reason for it.	Susu nyui aɖe nɔ eme.
Leave one of your men here.	Gblẽ wò amewo dometɔ ɖeka ɖe afisia.
If it is, it is never consistent.	Ne ele eme la, ke mewɔa nu ɖekae gbeɖe o.
Perhaps there is still a way.	Ðewohĩ mɔ aɖe gakpɔtɔ li.
In real time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ŋutɔŋutɔ me.
He can’t control it.	Mate ŋu aɖu edzi o.
Maybe this is doing time.	Ðewohĩ esia le ɣeyiɣi wɔm.
The city is not a city.	Du menye du o.
Nice to meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam be medo go wò.
This is a little different.	Esia to vovo vie.
Four people died.	Ame ene ku.
Something is wrong with the thread.	Nane gblẽ le ka la ŋu.
In my life is over.	Le nye agbe me wu enu.
But this time it will be the opposite.	Gake fifia ya, anye nusi to vovo na ema.
I told him this one last time.	Megblɔ nya sia nɛ zi mamlɛtɔ.
None of them did anything.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ naneke o.
We are very important.	Míele vevie ŋutɔ.
Come back and join us again, right?	Trɔ va kpe ɖe mía ŋu ake, alo?
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe tae esia tso.
That’s what saved me.	Emae nye nusi xɔ nam.
I wanted him to have a long career.	Medi be wòawɔ dɔ didi aɖe nɛ.
More than it is now.	Wu alesi wòle fifia.
I wonder where he is.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be afikae wòle hã.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t prove it through me.	Mete ŋu ɖo kpe edzi to nye dzi o.
Everyone talked about it, but no one did anything.	Amesiame ƒo nu tso eŋu, gake ame aɖeke mewɔ naneke o.
Eventually, that.	Mlɔeba la, ema.
In many cases.	Le go geɖe me la.
A place only you know.	Teƒe si wò koe nya.
There was no way he was talking to anyone.	Mɔ aɖeke meli si dzi wònɔ nu ƒom na ame aɖeke le o.
Act now!	Wɔ nu fifia!
Ease.	Bɔbɔe.
Someone better act quickly.	Anyo be ame aɖe nawɔ nane kaba.
Not that he would but still.	Menye be awɔe o gake kokoko.
Book well in advance.	Wɔ agbalẽ do ŋgɔ nyuie.
And in that respect, it’s the same thing.	Eye le go ma me la, nu ɖeka ma ke koe wònye.
Nothing will come of it.	Nu aɖeke mado tso eme o.
More than anywhere else.	Wu teƒe bubu ɖesiaɖe.
It’s a great opportunity for you.	Enye mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe na wò.
We were fascinated by ours.	Míaƒe nu lé dzi na mí.
Where is my mistake.	Afikae nye vodada le.
This doesn’t work.	Esia mewɔa dɔ o.
They have very little money.	Ga sue aɖe koe le wo si.
There was more than enough space.	Teƒe si sɔ gbɔ wu nɔ afima.
Sign up here.	De asi agbalẽ te le afisia.
His own first name.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe ŋkɔ gbãtɔ.
It was my first job.	Enye nye dɔ gbãtɔ.
I had just asked him a question.	Ðeko mebia nya aɖee teti koe nye ema.
We know you have a busy schedule.	Míenya be vovo mele ŋuwò o le asiwò.
This is a pretty big deal.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But it can be real.	Gake ate ŋu anye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We can be better than that.	Míate ŋu anyo wu ema.
He had a little help.	Kpekpeɖeŋu vi aɖe nɔ esi.
I know you’re there.	Menya be èle afima.
Some of them he liked.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo dze eŋu.
I promise that	Medo ŋugbe be .
He had never been sick in his life.	Medze dɔ le eƒe agbe me kpɔ o.
Mine is one of them.	Nye tɔ nye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
But that’s not all there is to it.	Gake menye ema koe nye ema o.
He fell like a stone.	Edze anyi abe kpe ene.
He will see you himself.	Eya ŋutɔ akpɔ wò.
It could be anyone.	Ate ŋu anye amesiame.
It was quite a surprise.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku kura.
It was as if he did not exist.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe meli o ene.
It worked well for you.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie na wò.
That’s what’s interesting to me.	Emae nye nusi doa dzidzɔ nam.
But in reality, that is impossible.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, ema manya wɔ o.
His voice was fast and unsteady.	Eƒe gbe nɔ du dzi eye meli ke o.
It’s probably there, too.	Anɔ eme be ele afima hã.
There is only up or down.	Dzi alo anyi koe li.
Maybe it’s part of a lie.	Ðewohĩ alakpa ƒe akpa aɖee.
I really have to make a living.	Ele nam ŋutɔŋutɔ be makpɔ nye agbe dzi.
I am doing some work.	Mele dɔ aɖewo wɔm.
No money is needed.	Ga aɖeke mehiã o.
I couldn’t speak.	Nyemete ŋu ƒo nu o.
He would help her and she would help him.	Akpe ɖe eŋu eye eya hã akpe ɖe eŋu.
That’s a lot of it.	Ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
But, it could be a mistake.	Gake, ate ŋu anye vodada.
The same can happen here.	Nenema ke ate ŋu adzɔ le afisia hã.
Some of them anyway.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I'll tell him you're not here.	Magblɔ nɛ be mèle afisia o.
It’s just not there.	Ðeko mele afima o.
But he didn’t care about her.	Gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ o.
That was a good day.	Ema nye ŋkeke nyui aɖe dzi.
He has a great idea in mind.	Susu gã aɖe le susu me nɛ.
I know.	Menya.
Now or never!.	Fifia alo gbeɖe o!.
I hope this is all good.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia katã nyo.
Look at the guys!	Kpɔ ɖa!
Want me to go home with him.	Di be mayi aƒeme kplii.
But be careful.	Gake kpɔ nyuie.
Just a little bit.	Vi aɖe ko.
It was a difficult job.	Dɔ sesẽ aɖee wònye.
I am just playing a role.	Ðeko mele akpa aɖe wɔm.
Hopefully we can keep doing that.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be míate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ esia wɔm.
People need work.	Amewo hiã dɔ.
I’m not going out with anyone.	Nyemele go dom kple ame aɖeke o.
No one did that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
And it’s my head.	Eye nye tae.
That it really is just another matter.	Be le nyateƒe me la, nya bubu aɖe koe wònye.
People have asked this question many times.	Amewo bia nya sia zi geɖe.
We know more now than ever before.	Míenya nu geɖe fifia wu tsã.
I just don’t know what to say.	Ðeko nyemenya nya si magblɔ o.
This is not a way.	Esia menye mɔ aɖeke o.
That’s just the kind of person he is.	Ame si ƒomevi wònye koe nye ema.
But in reality, it can.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, ate ŋui.
This is impossible to happen.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I'll tell you when.	Magblɔ ɣekaɣie na wò.
That’s all we can do.	Ema koe nye nusi míate ŋu awɔ.
But he didn’t understand.	Gake mese egɔme o.
I made a song.	Mewɔ ha aɖe.
Also.	Hã.
Something is different, something is wrong.	Nane to vovo, nane gblẽ.
This did not impress him much.	Esia mewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi boo o.
Maybe, a little bit.	Ðewohĩ, vie.
Who is all lost.	Ame si katã bu.
He seemed to know nothing.	Edze abe menya naneke o ene.
I hope it happens soon.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ kpuie.
Why not?' 	Aleke wɔ?'
It would have turned out better.	Anye ne ado tso eme nyuie wu hafi.
It’s a part of my life.	Enye nye agbe ƒe akpa aɖe.
I was angry with him.	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu.
However, there is a mistake.	Ke hã, vodada aɖe li.
It will be fine.	Anɔ nyuie.
This was a little disappointing.	Esia te ɖe dzinye vie.
And everything works just fine.	Eye nusianu wɔa dɔ nyuie ko.
Almost no one can.	Ame aɖeke kloe mate ŋui o.
That sounds pretty bad.	Ema ɖi nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔ.
They have conflicting skills.	Aɖaŋu siwo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu le wo si.
But if one can, one will.	Gake ne ame ate ŋui la, awɔe nenema.
He couldn’t do anything.	Mete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
That’s his idea.	Eƒe susu ma.
A man appeared behind him.	Ŋutsu aɖe do ɖe megbe nɛ.
The wind was blowing strongly.	Ya ƒo sesĩe.
I had a lot of fun doing this.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ le esia wɔwɔ me.
There is plenty of food here, but there are still a few things left.	Nuɖuɖu sɔ gbɔ le afisia, gake nu ʋɛ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ li.
He seemed very surprised.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ ene.
He doesn’t care what you think of him.	Metsɔ ɖeke le nusi nèsusu tso eŋu me o.
He was obviously surprised by what happened.	Edze ƒã be nusi dzɔ la wɔ nuku nɛ.
It is very much like that.	Ele nenema ŋutɔ.
That’s what happened here.	Emae nye nusi dzɔ le afisia.
These two scenarios are really similar.	Nɔnɔme eve siawo sɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t want to see anyone.	Nyemedi be makpɔ ame aɖeke o.
But he couldn’t stand it.	Gake mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
I would like to know what is going on.	Madi be manya nusi le edzi yim.
I really don’t want to get close to these people.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be mate ɖe ame siawo ŋu o.
Let me talk to him.	Na maƒo nu kplii.
There were no cars, no people there.	Ʋu aɖeke menɔ anyi o, ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
Can you play this song?	Àte ŋu aƒo ha siaa?
It was something new to them.	Enye nu yeye na wo.
We know exactly what we are doing and what we will do.	Míenya nusi tututu wɔm míele kple nusi míawɔ.
I had a long day.	Mekpɔ ŋkeke didi aɖe.
That was obvious enough.	Ema dze ƒã ale gbegbe.
This is very important.	Esia le vevie ŋutɔ.
This is great news for you.	Nya gã aɖee nye esia na wò.
No one can find us here.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu ake ɖe mía ŋu le afisia o.
He didn’t want to fight her.	Medi be yeawɔ avu kplii o.
This last week.	Esia le kwasiɖa si va yi me.
Not again.	Menye ake o.
Not in this case.	Menye le go sia me o.
I'd like to see what people do with this.	Madi be makpɔ nusi amewo wɔa kple esia.
Like it’s a good thing, not a bad thing.	Abe alesi wònye nu nyui, ke menye nu gbegblẽ o ene.
He fought, but not much of one.	Ewɔ avu, gake menye ɖeka geɖe o.
He couldn’t explain it.	Mete ŋu ɖe eme o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That warmed me up.	Ema na mexɔ dzo ɖe edzi.
His hair is short.	Eƒe ɖa le kpuie.
That wasn’t what was bothering me.	Menye nu ma nɔ fu ɖem nam o.
And, there is a lot of truth in that.	Eye, nyateƒe geɖe le ema me.
Sure.	Ka ɖe edzi.
And they’ll pretty much do whatever you want.	Eye woawɔ nusianu si nèdi kloe.
That used to be simple enough.	Tsã la, nya ma nɔ bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
King threw himself into it.	Fia tsɔ eɖokui ƒu gbe ɖe eme.
This is a pretty big deal.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
It had been a long day, and he was tired.	Ŋkeke didi aɖee nye ema, eye ɖeɖi te eŋu.
It’s time to fight you.	Ɣeyiɣi si me woawɔ avu kpli wò la de.
Quite a few of them actually.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I hope it didn't upset her.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be medo dziku nɛ o.
We have time to spare.	Ɣeyiɣi le mía si.
Perhaps there is a role in the work.	Ðewohĩ akpa aɖe le dɔa me.
They have a lot of things.	Nu geɖe le wo si.
How do you do the same?.	Aleke nàwɔ nenema ke?.
But this project didn’t work.	Gake dɔ sia mewɔ dɔ o.
He has no machinery.	Mɔ̃ aɖeke mele esi o.
It doubled another.	Edzi ɖe edzi zi gbɔ zi eve bubu.
Which is usually everyone.	Nusi nye amesiame zi geɖe.
I’ve never seen them myself.	Nye ŋutɔ nyemekpɔ wo kpɔ o.
I don’t have to do this.	Mehiã be mawɔ esia o.
People know who you are.	Amewo nya amesi nènye.
This is something else that happened two years ago.	Esia nye nu bubu aɖe si dzɔ ƒe eve enye sia.
He can do no wrong.	Mate ŋu awɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
I'll see you there.	Makpɔ wò le afima.
Everything felt like the same old, same old.	Nusianu se le eɖokui me abe xoxo ma ke, xoxo ma ke ene.
I can’t let you go properly now.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le ŋuwò nyuie fifia o.
That other side of me.	Nye akpa bubu ma.
It’s hard work.	Enye dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ.
One thing in the past is unified.	Nu ɖeka si dzɔ va yi ye wɔ ɖeka.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
I know them too well.	Menya wo nyuie akpa.
It seems like the right thing to do.	Edze abe nusi sɔ ene.
I have never tried it.	Nyemete kpɔ kpɔ o.
There was no one else in the background.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ megbe o.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Not for us, anyway.	Menye na mí o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I have made mistakes.	Mewɔ vodada kpɔ.
There may be one or two people.	Ame ɖeka alo eve ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
There is one thing missing.	Nu ɖeka aɖe li si bu.
Over a period of at least one year.	Le ƒe ɖeka ya teti ƒe ɣeyiɣi aɖe me.
And nothing is going on.	Eye naneke mele edzi yim o.
Not even you.	Menye wò hã o.
And that’s a good thing.	Eye nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
We didn’t have any money.	Ga aɖeke menɔ mía si o.
The car sped away.	Ʋua ƒu du dzo.
Just a few short ones.	Kpuie ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
It could have been on your side.	Ate ŋu anye wò akpa dzi hafi.
I knew it wasn’t me.	Menya be menye nyee o.
Please come inside.	Taflatse va ge ɖe eme.
He did what he did.	Ewɔ nu si wòwɔ.
And kill you.	Eye wu wò.
You can do this very easily.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I am always amazed by the fact that it is always there.	Nyateƒe si wònye be ele anyi ɣesiaɣi la wɔa nuku nam ɣesiaɣi.
That time is back.	Ɣeyiɣi ma trɔ gbɔ.
I did it on my own.	Mewɔe le ɖokuinye si.
There will be so many opportunities for them.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe ŋutɔ anɔ anyi na wo.
This is a very viable strategy.	Esia nye aɖaŋu si ate ŋu awɔ dɔ ŋutɔ.
I think you might be able to do something with it.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ àte ŋu awɔ nane kplii.
I did him a great wrong.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ gã aɖe nɛ.
I wouldn’t be able to get a job.	Anye ne nyemate ŋu akpɔ dɔ o.
But I will tell you what to do.	Gake magblɔ nusi nàwɔ na wò.
I tried everything there.	Mete nusianu kpɔ le afima.
His reputation was ruined.	Eƒe ŋkɔ gblẽ le eŋu.
And I started some of them.	Eye nyee dze wo dometɔ aɖewo gɔme.
And a lot of things are not happy anymore.	Eye nu geɖe megale dzidzɔ kpɔm o.
I took a step forward.	Medo afɔ aɖe ɖe ŋgɔ.
It was just him.	Ðeko wònye eya ŋutɔ.
Provide the necessary funds.	Na ga si hiã la.
They often have an inactive life.	Zi geɖe la, agbe si mele dɔ wɔm o nɔa wo si.
I think you missed the point.	Mesusu be nya la to ŋuwò.
No one greeted me when I arrived.	Ame aɖeke medo gbe nam esi meva ɖo o.
It worked for me.	Ewɔ dɔ nam.
You never know when your deadline will be.	Mènya ɣekaɣie wò ɣeyiɣi mamlɛtɔ ava ɖo gbeɖe o.
Check this out.	Kpɔ esia ɖa.
That makes no sense.	Susu aɖeke mele nya ma ŋu o.
But he wasn’t in a hurry.	Gake menɔ du dzi o.
Just please go.	Ðeko taflatse yi.
It will be a lot of work today.	Anye nu geɖe wɔwɔ egbea.
He didn't see anything	Mekpɔ naneke o .
Too many problems.	Kuxi geɖe akpa.
Now if you don’t mind.	Azɔ ne meɖe fu na wò o.
And it was very small.	Eye wònɔ sue ŋutɔ.
I don’t see any reason to let it go yet.	Nyemekpɔ susu aɖeke si tae maɖe asi le eŋu haɖe o.

Get closer now!.	Te ɖe ŋuwò fifia!.
He was clearly not satisfied.	Edze ƒã be eƒe dzi medze eme o.
You could have done more.	Àte ŋu awɔ geɖe wu hafi.
A loud male voice answered.	Ŋutsu aɖe ƒe gbe sesẽ aɖe ɖo eŋu.
It didn’t surprise him.	Mewɔ nuku nɛ o.
It’s not at all surprising.	Mewɔ nuku kura o.
But what came out of his mouth didn’t matter.	Gake nu si do tso eƒe nu me la mehiã o.
Maybe something will come up.	Ðewohĩ nane ado mo ɖa.
Not to do something.	Menye be woawɔ nane o.
But there are times.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖewo li.
The most important thing.	Nusi le vevie wu la.
What place is this?	Teƒe kae nye esia?
He didn’t know what to do.	Menya nu si wòle be woawɔ o.
I actually fell off.	Medze anyi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Nothing came out of his mouth.	Naneke medo go le eƒe nu me o.
We can have some fun.	Míate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ aɖewo.
Everyone has a role to play.	Akpa aɖe le ame ɖesiaɖe si.
But I couldn’t do it.	Gake nyemete ŋu wɔe o.
I want to know what happened there.	Medi be manya nusi dzɔ le afima.
It seemed pretty amazing.	Edze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ ene.
But he was a good dog.	Gake avu nyui aɖee wònye.
The police eventually released them.	Kpovitɔwo ɖe asi le wo ŋu mlɔeba.
But it hasn’t arrived yet.	Gake meva ɖo haɖe o.
You can do this.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia.
Obviously there is a big but.	Edze ƒã be gake gã aɖe li.
They were so excited.	Dzi dzɔ wo ale gbegbe.
He looked better tonight.	Edze nyuie wu le zã sia me.
In addition, they are giving you.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu la, wole nu nam wò.
You don’t have to do everything alone.	Mehiã be wò ɖeka nawɔ nusianu o.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Nyemenya nusi le edzi yim o.
None of us know what happened to them.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke menya nusi va dzɔ ɖe wo dzi o.
Nothing and everything exists at once.	Naneke kple nusianu meli zi ɖeka o.
I'm sure he'll be here very soon.	Meka ɖe edzi be ava afisia kpuie ŋutɔ.
We can give thousands.	Míate ŋu ana nu akpe geɖe.
This can take weeks or months.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ kwasiɖa alo ɣleti geɖe.
One great job.	Dɔ gã ɖeka.
It’s amazing actually.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ le nyateƒe me.
One was obviously a really bad job.	Edze ƒã be ɖeka nye dɔ gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This seems very high.	Edze abe esia kɔ ŋutɔ ene.
Everything about that idea sounds great.	Nusianu si ku ɖe susu ma ŋu la ɖi nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Please let me let it go.	Taflatse na maɖe asi le eŋu.
In many ways, that was the easy part.	Le mɔ geɖe nu la, emae nye akpa si nɔ bɔbɔe.
That’s my problem.	Emae nye nye kuxi.
There were two men in it.	Ŋutsu eve nɔ eme.
I might be wrong.	Ðewohĩ mawɔ vodada.

Or a time in our lives.	Alo ɣeyiɣi aɖe le míaƒe agbe me.
Now, it’s not that simple.	Fifia, menye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
It would be hot, he would say.	Axɔ dzo, agblɔ be.
Come on, kid.	Va, ɖevi.
That is not true.	Ema menye nyateƒe o.
I have to continue my work.	Ele nam be mayi nye dɔa dzi.
They seem to be fine with it.	Edze abe wole nyuie le eŋu ene.
The man who should.	Ŋutsu si wòle be.
He needs money.	Ehiã ga.
It seems impossible.	Edze abe ɖe mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.
Getting there, but not there yet.	Afima ɖoɖo, gake menye afima haɖe o.
Stay with us.	Nɔ mía gbɔ.
You’ll be surprised.	Awɔ nuku na wò.
I wondered who he was.	Mebia ɖokuinye be amekae wònye hã.
I want to know what happened next.	Medi be manya nusi dzɔ le ema megbe.
He has only me.	Nye ɖeka koe le esi.
A little extra.	Vi aɖe kpe ɖe eŋu.
He didn’t know what else to do.	Menya nu bubu si wòawɔ o.
If you have the time.	Ne ɣeyiɣi le asiwò.
It’s bad air.	Enye ya gbegblẽ.
Once a week is fine.	Zi ɖeka le kwasiɖa me nyo ŋutɔ.
Everybody is fighting everybody.	Amesiame le avu wɔm kple amesiame.
Maybe a thousand people in a city.	Ðewohĩ ame akpe ɖeka le du aɖe me.
I just don’t know what to do about it.	Ðeko nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso eŋu o.
In fact, that may surprise some.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema ate ŋu awɔ nuku na ame aɖewo.
A little point for me.	Nya sue aɖe nam.
Want to go further.	Di be yeayi edzi ayi ŋgɔ wu.
To do that well takes time.	Be woawɔ ema nyuie bia ɣeyiɣi.
I will protect you.	Makpɔ wò ta.
He didn’t come twice.	Meva zi eve o.
I want to do that.	Medi be mawɔe nenema.
I found the house easily.	Meke ɖe aƒea ŋu bɔbɔe.
I think we can have a lot in common.	Mesusu be nu geɖe ate ŋu anɔ mía si siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
But he seemed like a good kid.	Gake edze abe ɖevi nyui aɖe ene.
He seemed to be talking to her.	Edze abe ɖe wònɔ nu ƒom nɛ ene.
They’re all on board!	Wo katã wole ʋua me!
But you have to do your part.	Gake ele be nàwɔ wò akpa dzi.
There are many people there.	Ame geɖe le afima.
But we definitely have a big problem.	Gake kuxi gã aɖe le mía si godoo.
He didn’t concentrate properly.	Metsɔ eƒe susu ɖo nu ŋu nyuie o.
It’s a great thing.	Nu gã aɖee.
You can’t talk to him.	Màte ŋu aƒo nu kplii o.
Perhaps to him he was an all-rounder.	Ðewohĩ le eya gbɔ la, enye amesi ate ŋu awɔ nusianu.
Nobody can take that away from us, nobody can take that away from us.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ ema le mía si o, ame aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ ema le mía si o.
But very different scenarios ended up.	Gake nɔnɔme siwo to vovo ŋutɔ la va wu enu.
So far, no one has found him.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ame aɖeke meva ke ɖe eŋu o.
It makes sense to him.	Susu le eme nɛ.
Some things just happened.	Ðeko nu aɖewo dzɔ.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
And it is working very well.	Eye ele dɔ wɔm nyuie ŋutɔ.
An eye for an eye.	Ŋku ɖe ŋku teƒe.
I quit my job.	Meɖe asi le nye dɔa ŋu.
There’s a lot here.	Nu geɖe le afisia.
Now more than ever.	Fifia wu tsã.

Clearly there is work to be done here.	Edze ƒã be dɔ aɖe li woawɔ le afisia.
Isn’t that beautiful.	Ðe menye nusi nya kpɔ oa.
This is the only difference.	Esia koe to vovo.
You have the tendency to do that.	Nu ma wɔwɔ ƒe nɔnɔme le asiwò.
But he’s talking about everything.	Gake eƒe nu le nu ƒom tso nusianu ŋu.
Take your gun with you.	Tsɔ wò tu la ɖe asi.
Do come inside.	Do va ge ɖe eme.
Let me know if you have any questions.	Na manya ne nya aɖe le asiwò.
I really wanted him to be surprised.	Medi vevie be wòawɔ nuku nɛ.
How do we know what is really true?	Aleke míawɔ anya nusi nye nyateƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ?
He was the perfect fit for her, and it was an opportunity for me.	Enye amesi sɔ nyuie nɛ, eye wònye mɔnukpɔkpɔ nam.
That’s it, more or less.	Emae nye ema, wu alo wu nenema.
He did something wrong, not me.	Ewɔ nu gbegblẽ, ke menye nyee o.
His face showed nothing.	Eƒe mo meɖe naneke fia o.
I don’t think that’s normal.	Nyemesusu be ema nye nusi sɔ o.
Those who are.	Ame siwo nye.
Doing something is something.	Nane wɔwɔ nye nane.
This is a mistake.	Esia nye vodada.
I think there will be situations where we do that.	Mesusu be nɔnɔme aɖewo anɔ anyi siwo me míawɔ ema le.
Take that step.	Ðe afɔ ma.
I needed to go outside.	Ehiã be mado go ayi eme.
But he couldn't say that now.	Gake mete ŋu gblɔ nya ma fifia o.
I'm looking forward to that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na ema.
I knew we could be together.	Menya be míate ŋu awɔ ɖeka.
I don’t know how to do it today.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔe egbea o.
He doesn’t know where you’re going.	Menya afi si yim nèle o.

It wasn’t in it.	Menɔ eme o.
I know them well.	Menya wo nyuie.
We have no idea what he did.	Míenya nusi wòwɔ la kura o.
It worked out well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie.

He could say it could be better.	Ate ŋu agblɔ be ate ŋu anyo wu.

We know these statements are true.	Míenya be nya siawo nye nyateƒe.
The reality of it.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si le eme.
There is too much money.	Ga sɔ gbɔ akpa.
Which is against me.	Nusi tsi tre ɖe ŋunye.
That’s the only thing that works so far.	Ema koe nye nusi wɔa dɔ vaseɖe fifia.
Don't know for what though.	Menya na nusi tae o ke hã.
And now look at me.	Eye azɔ kpɔm ɖa.
It seemed to be the case.	Edze abe ɖe wònɔ nenema ene.
And everything works.	Eye nusianu wɔa dɔ.
No one could approve of my gun, no one could approve of it.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu da asi ɖe nye tu dzi o, ame aɖeke mete ŋu da asi ɖe edzi o.
You seem pretty comfortable with it.	Edze abe wò dzi dze eme ŋutɔ le eŋu ene.
He doesn’t know where you are.	Menya afi si nèle o.
I put my hand on it.	Metsɔ nye asi ɖo edzi.
If you have a problem, speak up.	Ne kuxi aɖe le ŋuwò la, ƒo nu.
I just knew it was here coming.	Ðeko menya be ele afisia gbɔna.
There is no one in the car.	Ame aɖeke mele ʋua me o.
You can experiment with a couple of things.	Àte ŋu ado nu eve aɖewo kpɔ.
That seems reasonable.	Nya ma dze abe susu le eme ene.
It was what he expected.	Enye nusi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na.
Twice in fact.	Zi eve le nyateƒe me.
This case is now over.	Nya sia wu enu fifia.
But people came to the rescue, and they liked it.	Gake amewo va kpe ɖe eŋu, eye edzɔ dzi na wo.
But it will happen.	Gake ava eme.
I don’t understand what he wants.	Nyemese nu si dim wòle la gɔme o.
Everyone hated them.	Amesiame lé fu wo.

I don’t know much about it but I know it’s nothing like that.	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o gake menya be menye naneke nenema o.
He seemed to be a different person now.	Edze abe ame bubu aɖee wònye fifia ene.

But my mind was very happy and content.	Gake nye susu kpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ eye dzi dze eme.

It was a lot of fun for us.	Enye dzidzɔ na mí ŋutɔ.
And you can definitely see what it looks like.	Eye àte ŋu akpɔ alesi wòle godoo.
I got to know a lot of them really well.	Meva nya wo dometɔ geɖe nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You are in your home now.	Èle wò aƒeme fifia.

And that’s important.	Eye esia le vevie.
It seems to be working fine so far.	Edze abe ele dɔ wɔm nyuie vaseɖe fifia ene.
It was a thriving city.	Enye du si me amewo nɔ ŋgɔ yim le.
But there was one positive outcome.	Gake nu nyui ɖeka aɖe do tso eme.
This guy has a heart.	Dzi le ŋutsu sia si.
He didn’t care much for her.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ boo o.
Thankfully, the top is going up.	Akpe na wò be ta la le dzi yim.
This will help them.	Esia akpe ɖe wo ŋu.
This eventually stopped.	Esia va tɔ mlɔeba.
I was able to do that.	Mete ŋu wɔe nenema.
I have to see you.	Ele nam be makpɔ wò.
Stand up for it.	Tsi tre ɖe edzi.
We knew he was a good guy.	Míenya be enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe.
It’s a state of mind.	Enye susu ƒe nɔnɔme.
He was a very nice guy.	Enye ame nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
When that time comes, we have to fight.	Ne ɣeyiɣi ma ɖo la, ele be míawɔ avu.
As.	Abe.
Until that night.	Vaseɖe zã ma me.
This is blood money.	Esia nye ʋu ga.
I'll just go home.	Ðeko mayi aƒeme.
Look, look, look.	Kpɔ ɖa, kpɔ ɖa.
Work while you wait.	Wɔ dɔ esime nèle lalam.
Mine doesn’t do that.	Nye tɔ mewɔa nu ma o.
He could not understand her death.	Mete ŋu se eƒe ku gɔme o.
If it didn’t work, no one would be alive.	Ne mewɔ dɔ o la, anye ne ame aɖeke manɔ agbe o.
From you inside.	Tso wo me.
I stood up, too.	Nye hã metsi tre.
And now it’s all over.	Eye fifia nu sia nu wu enu.
I would be the first one to do it.	Nyee anye ame gbãtɔ si awɔe.
Only the most important ones.	Wo dometɔ siwo le vevie wu koe.
But not like anyone else.	Gake menye abe ame bubu aɖeke ene o.
Not as it is here.	Menye abe alesi wòle le afisia ene o.
Nothing personal here between you and me.	Ame ŋutɔ ƒe naneke mele afisia le mía kple wò dome o.
There was definitely something going on.	Nane nɔ edzi yim le afima godoo.
This is a difficult task.	Dɔ sesẽ aɖee nye esia.
His life was in them.	Eƒe agbe nɔ wo me.
But we will fight this.	Gake míawɔ avu kple esia.
That’s too complicated.	Ema nye nya sesẽ akpa.
I’ve never seen anyone.	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke kpɔ o.
Life can only speak life.	Agbe koe agbe ate ŋu aƒo nu.
Give it a hand.	Do asi ɖe eŋu.
Nothing is that simple.	Naneke mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
One new, one old.	Yeye ɖeka, ɖeka xoxo.
I can’t do anything at all.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke kura o.
Come you in the car.	Va wò ɖe ʋua me.
Or that there is none.	Alo be meli o.
And it doesn’t look any easier.	Eye edze abe ɖe wòle bɔbɔe wu ene o.
I will take care of this myself.	Nye ŋutɔ makpɔ esia gbɔ.
I have done this so far.	Mewɔ esia vaseɖe fifia.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It’s a little different.	Eƒe nɔnɔme to vovo vie.
Please consider that.	Taflatse bu nya ma ŋu.
He seemed to be smart.	Edze abe edze aɖaŋu ene.
I can’t go further than that.	Nyemate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu ema o.
Again, we don’t know.	Le afisia hã la, míenya o.
You know what it’s like.	Ènya alesi wòle.
Or if any of them do.	Alo ne wo dometɔ aɖe wɔe nenema.
This was very exciting for me.	Esia do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
It just can’t happen.	Ðeko mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I like that on a morning.	Ema dzɔa dzi nam le ŋdi aɖe me.
Or for him to do the same to them.	Alo be eya hã nawɔ nenema ke ɖe wo ŋu.
There are times when you.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖewo li siwo me wò.
But the little personal project.	Gake ame ŋutɔ ƒe dɔ sue la.
None of them survived.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke metsi agbe o.
Once you arrive, leave work.	Ne ènya ɖo ko la, dzo le dɔme.
I don’t want to do it here.	Nyemedi be mawɔe le afisia o.
It is very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ.
You’ll be surprised.	Awɔ nuku na wò.
A lot can happen in a year.	Nu geɖe ate ŋu adzɔ le ƒe ɖeka me.
I was too short.	Menɔ kpuie akpa.
That’s what my whole thing is.	Emae nye nu si nye nya bliboa nye.
Like something here.	Abe nane le afisia ene.
Life is hard there.	Agbe sesẽ le afima.
There is no reason for that.	Susu aɖeke meli si tae wòle nenema ɖo o.
A very different attitude and structure.	Nɔnɔme kple ɖoɖo si to vovo kura.
As long as this takes.	Ɣeyiɣi didi si esia xɔa ɣeyiɣi.
By doing this.	To esia wɔwɔ me.
Which is what he did.	Nusi nye nusi wòwɔ.
This is on the rise.	Esia le edzi.
This is a very good one.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ.
Blood rushed to his face.	Ʋu ƒu du yi eƒe mo.
For the sake of my city.	Le nye du la ta.
And it was a huge mistake.	Eye vodada gã aɖee wònye.
This simply cannot be true.	Ðeko esia mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
Every one of them was better than this before.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe nyo wu esia tsã.
This is a pretty big day.	Esia nye ŋkeke gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
He didn’t survive.	Metsi agbe o.
In a way anyway.	Le mɔ aɖe nu le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
There may be a few reasons for this.	Ðewohĩ susu ʋɛ aɖewo tae esia dzɔ ɖo.
I saw who he was.	Mekpɔ amesi wònye.
My real face.	Nye mo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But in the moment, you seem to be alive.	Gake le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, edze abe èle agbe ene.
Police launched a manhunt.	Kpovitɔwo dze amewo didi gɔme.
This works well if you know what you are looking for.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie ne ènya nusi dim nèle.
He lost his job a year later.	Dɔ ge le esi le ƒe ɖeka megbe.
I don’t know where he is.	Nyemenya afi si wòle o.
A new life, perhaps.	Agbe yeye, ɖewohĩ.
Let me explain it this way.	Mina maɖe eme alea.
Try food less often.	Te nuɖuɖu kpɔ zi geɖe o.
None of us know what you are.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke menya nusi nènye o.
I have enough to keep me going.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ le asinye si ana mayi edzi anɔ dɔ wɔm.
He is doing very well.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔ.
Hopefully, that’s enough.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be, ema sɔ gbɔ.
You have to say something positive in return.	Ele be nàgblɔ nya nyui aɖe ɖe eteƒe.
In addition, there is a problem.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu la, kuxi aɖe hã li.
Neither party took action.	Akpa aɖeke meɖe afɔ aɖeke o.
I didn’t know you were trying.	Nyemenya be èle agbagba dzem o.
Always do one thing at a time.	Wɔ nu ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me ɣesiaɣi.
But I was the only one there.	Gake nye ɖeka koe nɔ afima.
His heart pounded.	Eƒe dzi ƒo sesĩe.
There is no problem there.	Kuxi aɖeke mele afima o.
A logical mind opened up new possibilities.	Susu si me susu le ʋu nu yeye siwo ate ŋu adzɔ.
We have been waiting for this for a long time.	Míele esia lalam ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
His character is bad.	Eƒe nɔnɔme gblẽ.
This is going to be a big problem.	Esia ava nye kuxi gã aɖe.
I think it might be.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ anɔ nenema.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
These books are very profound.	Agbalẽ siawo de to ŋutɔ.
It’s not just a little thing.	Menye nu sue aɖe ko.
Please come this way.	Meɖe kuku, va mɔ sia dzi.
I have to do this.	Ele be mawɔ esia.
But now, of course.	Gake fifia ya.
It’s just for me.	Nye ɖeka koe wònye na.
But this is clear.	Gake esia me kɔ ƒã.
And it was that way.	Eye wònye nenema.
But do it right.	Gake wɔe nyuie.
Not many, maybe.	Menye ame geɖe o, ɖewohĩ.
I doubt he could say the same.	Meke ɖi be ate ŋu agblɔ nya ma ke.
No one will know what he did.	Ame aɖeke manya nusi wòwɔ o.
I don’t know how to help you.	Nyemenya ale si mawɔ akpe ɖe ŋuwò o.
There is very little water.	Tsi sue aɖe koe le afima.
This should work, please try.	Ele be esia nawɔ dɔ, taflatse te kpɔ.
It contained an old gun.	Tu xoxo aɖe nɔ eme.
I'm waiting.	Mele lalam.
This obviously doesn’t work.	Edze ƒã be esia mewɔa dɔ o.
He didn’t present himself well.	Meɖe eɖokui fia nyuie o.
Not so well.	Menye nyuie nenema gbegbe o.
I had to do something.	Ele be mawɔ nane.
Just in case there is a problem.	Nenye be kuxi aɖe do mo ɖa ko.
Another two years just might be over.	Ðeko ƒe eve bubu ate ŋu awu enu.
That seems obvious to me.	Edze nam be nya ma dze ƒã.
But here there is none.	Gake le afisia la, ɖeke meli o.
I couldn’t do anything wrong.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
I have heard a lot about you.	Mese nu geɖe tso ŋuwò.
We are going home now.	Míele aƒeme yim fifia.
But something is different now.	Gake nane to vovo fifia.
I know that part too.	Nye hã menya akpa ma.
Few people know that city.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nya du ma.
But what they want is something completely different.	Gake nusi dim wole la nye nusi to vovo kura.
It’s just there now.	Ðeko wòle afima fifia.
Our situation now will be much better.	Míaƒe nɔnɔme fifia anyo ɖe edzi ale gbegbe.
I’m not so sure about that.	Nyemeka ɖe nya ma dzi nenema gbegbe o.
For your people.	Na wò amewo.
There is nothing to do.	Naneke meli woawɔ o.
The corpse will not dislodge.	Kuku la maɖe eɖokui ɖa o.
For you.	Na wò.
But he couldn’t.	Gake mete ŋui o.
How much.	Nenie.
To be just as effective.	Be woawɔ dɔ nyuie nenema ke.
But what do we know.	Gake nukae míenya.
There was no issue at all.	Nya aɖeke kura menɔ anyi o.
It seems like a big job.	Edze abe dɔ gã aɖee wònye ene.
But all seems to have ended well.	Gake edze abe nuwo katã wu enu nyuie ene.
Not much else seems to have made it this far.	Edze abe nu bubu geɖe mete ŋu ɖo afisia o ene.
He is doing well.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie.
There was no one anywhere.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afi aɖeke o.
I just need someone here for me.	Ðeko mehiã ame aɖe le afisia nam.
I want to know.	Medi be manya.
I am home now.	Meɖo aƒeme fifia.
They are being disturbing.	Wole fu ɖem na ame.
It happened last week.	Edzɔ le kwasiɖa si va yi me.
But not really.	Gake menye le nyateƒe me o.
But here we have a different situation.	Gake le afisia la, nɔnɔme bubu aɖee le mía si.
Why is this person talking louder than anyone else?	Nukatae ame sia le nu ƒom sesĩe wu ame bubu ɖesiaɖe?
Quickly, with so much.	Kaba, kple nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
We have a lot of books at home.	Agbalẽ geɖe le mía si le aƒeme.
I don’t have a child.	Vi mele asinye o.
My heart began to race.	Nye dzi va nɔ du dzi sesĩe.
It's very overlapping.	Enye nusi ƒoa ƒu ɖekae ŋutɔ.
He didn’t understand.	Mese egɔme o.
This is important.	Esia le vevie.
Thank you, man.	Akpe na wò, ame.
But it will be the same in every case.	Gake anɔ nenema le go sia go me.
It might be some other stuff as we work through it.	Ðewohĩ anye nu bubu aɖewo esi míele dɔ wɔm to eme.
I sat still for a while.	Menɔ anyi ɖe teƒe ɖeka vie.
This tea was too hard for me.	Te sia sesẽ nam akpa.
Yet we can do more.	Ke hã míate ŋu awɔ geɖe wu.
It doesn’t seem to be.	Edze abe mele nenema o ene.
It doesn’t matter who.	Mehiã be ame kae o.
It could have been better.	Ate ŋu anyo wu hafi.
They have many children.	Vi geɖe le wo si.
It was a good day.	Enye ŋkeke nyui aɖe.
I had a guy and he was a good guy.	Ŋutsu aɖe nɔ asinye eye wònye ame nyui aɖe.
But his situation is different now.	Gake eƒe nɔnɔme to vovo fifia.
The same thought went through my head over and over again.	Susu ma ke to nye ta me zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I can handle this.	Mate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ.
Song.	Ha.
It was a small town.	Du sue aɖee wònye.
But it has happened.	Gake edzɔ kpɔ.
That went on a lot.	Ema yi edzi ŋutɔ.
And this usually works so well.	Eye zi geɖe la, esia wɔa dɔ nyuie ale gbegbe.
Please, come.	Taflatse, va.
But he couldn't have felt that way this time.	Gake mate ŋu ase le eɖokui me nenema zi sia hafi o.
It would have been for the best.	Anye ne nu nyui wɔwɔ tae.
I was so close to me!	Mete ɖe ŋunye ale gbegbe!
I think you know that too.	Mesusu be wò hã ènya ema.
Look at the people we know.	Kpɔ ame siwo míenya la ɖa.
But just as many of them are excellent.	Gake nenema ke wo dometɔ geɖe hã nyo ŋutɔ.
I should be angrier, maybe.	Ele be mado dziku wu, ɖewohĩ.
It’s not on it.	Menye ɖe wòle edzi o.
It worked out very well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
Check that out.	Kpɔ ema ɖa.
See a teacher near us.	Kpɔ nufiala aɖe si te ɖe mía ŋu gbɔ.
He's almost one of them now.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka kloe wònye fifia.
This is more important to me.	Esia le vevie nam wu.
But, more needs to be done.	Gake, ehiã be woawɔ geɖe wu.
One shot, close by.	Tu ɖeka, si te ɖe eŋu.
But that never bothered me.	Gake ema meɖe fu nam gbeɖe o.
First thing tomorrow.	Nu gbãtɔ etsɔ.
There was no one to help him.	Ame aɖeke menɔ anyi akpe ɖe eŋu o.
Not that this is appropriate in the current situation.	Menye ɖe esia sɔ le nɔnɔme si li fifia nu o.
Maybe this new rule will actually work.	Ðewohĩ se yeye sia awɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I am as busy as ever.	Vovo mele ŋunye abe tsã ene.
I had to try.	Ele be mate kpɔ.
It could be something else.	Ate ŋu anye nu bubu aɖe.
Everything is about the dog.	Nusianu ku ɖe avu la ŋu.
He missed some places.	Teƒe aɖewo to eŋu.
He was a great guy.	Ŋutsu gã aɖee wònye.
That’s not expensive.	Ema mexɔ asi o.
A man can help but he is not sure.	Ŋutsu ate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu gake meka ɖe edzi o.
It is part of everything and everything is part of it.	Enye nusianu ƒe akpa aɖe eye nusianu nye eƒe akpa aɖe.
Too much kept running through his mind.	Nu geɖe akpa yi edzi nɔ du dzi le eƒe susu me.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
One can go on and on.	Ame ate ŋu ayi edzi.
That was a long time in the past.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe le ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me.
Our room was really just that.	Míaƒe xɔa me nɔ nenema tututu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s a normal thing.	Enye nu si sɔ.
Two more years.	Ƒe eve bubu.
Period.	Ɣeyiɣi.
Everyone seems to have someone.	Edze abe ame aɖe le amesiame si ene.
I do a lot of that these days.	Mewɔa ema ƒe akpa geɖe le ŋkeke siawo me.
Who exactly.	Ame si tututu.
Go back home, the gun is on.	Trɔ yi aƒeme, tu la le.
They are right.	Wole eteƒe.
Part of the project.	Dɔa ƒe akpa aɖe.
Once more perhaps.	Zi ɖeka ake ɖewohĩ.
But not while he was working.	Gake menye esime wònɔ dɔ wɔm o.
But you can help me if you can tell me more.	Gake àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye ne àte ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe nam.
But there is a place.	Gake teƒe aɖe li.
Very small, so new.	Susu sue ŋutɔ, yeye ale gbegbe.
He has something for everything.	Nane le esi na nusianu.
The missing part.	Akpa si bu la.
You can’t work it out.	Màte ŋu awɔ dɔ tso eŋu o.
Do you have enough to eat today?	Ðe nuɖuɖu sɔ gbɔ na wò egbea?
I hoped they would like it.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wo.
It will be like this quite often.	Anɔ anyi alea zi geɖe ŋutɔ.
He could be on his way here now.	Ate ŋu anɔ mɔ dzi le afisia fifia.
In that car.	Le ʋu ma me.
Feed the dog while he eats.	Na nuɖuɖu avu la esime wòle nu ɖum.
There was blood there.	Ʋu nɔ afima.
It’s easier for you.	Ele bɔbɔe na wò wu.
That’s reason enough, if you’re looking for a reason.	Emae nye susu si sɔ gbɔ, nenye be èle susu aɖe dim.
I couldn’t have done it without him.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe eya manɔmee o.
This is something new to me.	Esia nye nu yeye nam.
It’s as if we’ve always belonged here.	Ðeko wòle abe ɖe míenye afisia tɔ ɣesiaɣi ene.
Not so much anymore.	Menye nenema gbegbe o azɔ hã.
That he cared about her.	Be etsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ.
There was nothing in any of them.	Naneke menɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke me o.
A huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖe.
He was the only one there.	Eya koe nye ame si nɔ anyi.
The result surprised me.	Nusi do tso eme la wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
It could not have been otherwise.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema le mɔ bubu nu o.
It’s not very advanced.	Menye nusi yi ŋgɔ boo o.
This is a job that only he can do.	Esia nye dɔ si eya ɖeka koe ate ŋu awɔ.
One of two things will happen.	Nu eve dometɔ ɖeka adzɔ.
It doesn’t make sense at all.	Susu mele eme kura o.
But wrong in what way?.	Gake vodada le mɔ ka nu?.
He did a lot for me.	Ewɔ nu geɖe nam.
It’s not that late.	Menye nusi tsi megbe alea o.
And it often is.	Eye zi geɖe la, ele nenema.
That’s it this week.	Emae nye kwasiɖa sia me.
But water is water.	Gake tsi ya nye tsi.
I’ve seen that myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mekpɔ ema kpɔ.
That will do it for us.	Ema awɔe na mí.
It wasn’t easy to impress.	Menɔ bɔbɔe be wòawɔ dɔ ɖe edzi o.
That was important.	Ema nɔ vevie.
Have a great person.	Ame gã aɖe nanɔ asiwò.
That’s what will make me happy.	Emae nye nusi ana makpɔ dzidzɔ.
It will probably be my last.	Anɔ eme be anye nye mamlɛtɔ.
He did this over several weeks.	Ewɔ esia le kwasiɖa geɖe me.
Be careful here.	Kpɔ nyuie le afisia.
A very good quality.	Nɔnɔme nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Eating is harder.	Nuɖuɖu sesẽ wu.
I'm not sure how he came up with that name.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be aleke wòwɔ va kple ŋkɔ ma o.
It’s not me.	Menye nyee o.
Today, however, this is far from true.	Gake egbea la, esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
Possible, slightly.	Ate ŋu adzɔ, vie.
It didn’t meet my eye.	Medo go nye ŋku o.
More than once.	Wu zi ɖeka.
You are not one of us.	Menye mía dometɔ ɖekae nènye o.
He didn’t get a new job.	Mekpɔ dɔ yeye aɖeke o.
I should have done more.	Ðe wòle be mawɔ geɖe wu hafi.
I have seen a law at work in my life.	Mekpɔ se aɖe le dɔ wɔm le nye agbe me.
Only the end result matters.	Nusi ado tso eme mlɔeba koe le vevie.
I would like to see the result.	Madi be makpɔ nusi ado tso eme.
His head was down.	Eƒe ta nɔ anyi.
Not in a month.	Menye le ɣleti ɖeka me o.
He's clearly a bit ahead at this point.	Edze ƒã be ele ŋgɔ vie le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
He can do whatever he wants.	Ate ŋu awɔ nu si dze eŋu.
Right now, we’re not doing that.	Fifia la, míele ema wɔm o.
I’ve done something wrong.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ.
He has a good attitude.	Nɔnɔme nyui aɖe le esi.
The police arrived.	Kpovitɔwo va ɖo afima.
Head and heart can work together.	Ta kple dzi ate ŋu awɔ dɔ ɖekae.
Not at this time.	Menye le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
It didn’t work either.	Mewɔ dɔ hã o.
And it couldn’t have come together at a better time, either.	Eye mate ŋu ava ƒo ƒu le ɣeyiɣi si nyo wu me o, hã.
We are just getting on with our lives.	Ðeko míele míaƒe agbe dzi yim.
He can’t answer.	Mate ŋu aɖo eŋu o.
That never existed.	Ema menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
Just, mind you, this.	Ðeko, susu me na wò, esia.
He could have been there.	Ate ŋu anɔ afima hafi.
He had never felt this way about anyone.	Mese le eɖokui me alea ɖe ame aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o.
Reduce his anger.	Ðe eƒe dziku nu.
But he has one rule when people stay in his house.	Gake se ɖeka aɖe le esi ne amewo tsi eƒe aƒe me.
If any of them leave, we can take them back.	Ne wo dometɔ aɖe dzo la, míate ŋu axɔ wo.
And it won’t be easy.	Eye manɔ bɔbɔe o.
Everything seemed fine to me.	Edze nam be nusianu le nyuie.
I don’t want or need anything more.	Nyemedi alo mehiã naneke wu ema o.
It’s just a little bit.	Enye nu sue aɖe ko.
Everything seems to be fine.	Edze abe nusianu le nyuie ene.
As they are.	Abe alesi wole ene.
This was so extreme for him.	Esia nye nusi gbɔ eme nɛ ale gbegbe.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
It would make it work after all.	Awɔe be wòawɔ dɔ le nuwo katã megbe.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I listened to them all.	Meɖo to wo katã.
I want to share them with you.	Medi be magblɔ wo na mi.
This is likely to continue.	Anɔ eme be esia ayi edzi.
You can do a part of them.	Àte ŋu awɔ wo ƒe akpa aɖe.

None of them are in this case.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele nya sia me o.
We are a very small minority.	Míenye ame ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ.
I am not sure what happened though.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi dzɔ dzi ya o.
He took things too far.	Etsɔ nuwo yi ŋgɔ akpa.
I like a challenge.	Kuxi aɖe dzɔa dzi nam.
That can’t be necessary.	Ema mate ŋu ahiã o.
But it seems to me that you are doing well so far.	Gake edze nam be èle edzi dzem nyuie vaseɖe fifia.
Each piece represents something.	Akpa ɖesiaɖe tsi tre ɖi na nane.
There was nothing though.	Naneke menɔ anyi o ke hã.

I work here.	Mewɔa dɔ le afisia.
We have needed food.	Nuɖuɖu hiã mí kpɔ.
This is very important to me.	Esia le vevie nam ŋutɔ.
Only one person lost the job.	Ame ɖeka koe bu dɔa.

Use what works.	Zã nusi wɔa dɔ.
In this case, everything is fine.	Le go sia me la, nusianu le nyuie.
I have to make a mistake.	Ele be mawɔ vodada.
Two years later.	Ƒe eve megbe.
I can understand that.	Mate ŋu ase nya ma gɔme.
He is looking at the room.	Ele xɔa me kpɔm.
The room was warm.	Xɔa me xɔ dzo.
Which is very surprising.	Nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
They are in a completely different situation.	Wole nɔnɔme bubu kura me.
Call us now to schedule an appointment.	Ƒo ka na mí fifia nàwɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ɣeyiɣi aɖe ŋu.
They are going to kill us.	Wole mía wu ge.
And his voice is speaking.	Eye eƒe gbe le nu ƒom.
Water is life.	Tsi nye agbe.
But they have it in the background.	Gake ele wo si le megbe.
None of them said anything.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I don't know if the same thing is running by someone who doesn't have errors.	Nyemenya nenye be nu ma ke le du dzi le ame aɖe si si vodada mele o la si o.
Be careful of it.	Kpɔ nyuie le eŋu.
Join us in the snow.	Wɔ ɖeka kpli mí.
He can always process them with us.	Ate ŋu awɔ dɔ tso wo ŋu le mía gbɔ ɣesiaɣi.
There is something in it though.	Nane le eme gake.
I remember the exact word.	Meɖo ŋku nya la tututu dzi.
He's not going to get anything out of it.	Mele naneke xɔ ge le eme o.
This can be anything you want.	Esia ate ŋu anye nusianu si nèdi.
After a day of hard work, he was tired.	Le dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ ŋkeke ɖeka megbe la, ɖeɖi te eŋu.
None of them stuck in my mind.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke metsi susu me nam o.
That was clear on his face.	Ema me kɔ le eƒe mo.
What is your opinion on this?.	Nukae nye wò susu le nya sia ŋu?.
Usually he can’t.	Zi geɖe la, mate ŋui o.
That much is true.	Nu geɖe ma nye nyateƒe.
So do you, too.	Nenema ke wò hã.
An eye for an eye.	Ŋku ɖe ŋku teƒe.
A small town is where people know each other.	Du sue aɖee nye afisi amewo nya wo nɔewo le.
But also, I have a point.	Gake hã, nya aɖe le dzinye.
I will be here with him.	Manɔ afisia kplii.
Their legal guardians are not eligible.	Ame siwo kpɔa wo dzi le se nu la medze o.
Who is.	Ame kae nye.
Research available jobs.	Ku nu me le dɔ siwo li ŋu.
And only he knows.	Eye eya ɖeka koe nya.
They have a bad attitude.	Nɔnɔme gbegblẽ aɖe le wo si.
He was a very small man.	Enye ame sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
For so many others.	Na ame bubu geɖe ŋutɔ.
This was important to him.	Esia nɔ vevie nɛ.
The whole town is excited about the project.	Du bliboa le dzidzɔ kpɔm ɖe dɔa ŋu.
There is nothing there either.	Naneke mele afima hã o.
Please stop the car.	Taflatse tɔ ʋua.
The night began.	Zã dze egɔme.
In my room.	Le nye xɔa me.
Everyone said it was.	Amesiame gblɔ be ele nenema.
The work began at once.	Dɔa dze egɔme zi ɖeka.
Somewhere, somehow, something went wrong.	Le afi aɖe, le mɔ aɖe nu la, nane gblẽ.
To get involved in my life.	Be maƒo ɖokuinye ɖe nye agbe me.
I just wish there were more of them.	Ðeko medi be wo dometɔ geɖe nanɔ anyi.
I am not the only one who knows about this place.	Menye nye ɖeka koe nya nu tso teƒe sia ŋu o.
He will live his own life now.	Anɔ eya ŋutɔ ƒe agbe me fifia.
I was ready to call.	Menɔ klalo be maƒo ka.
Join.	Ge ɖe eme.
And he doesn’t want to be.	Eye medi be yeanɔ nenema o.
It would have been much easier.	Anye ne anɔ bɔbɔe wu kura hafi.
It’s not enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
So much work.	Dɔ geɖe ale gbegbe.
That is very difficult to do.	Ema wɔwɔ sesẽ ŋutɔ.
But this is impossible.	Gake esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
It’s a small place.	Enye teƒe sue aɖe.
I want to get rid of them.	Medi be maɖe wo ɖa.
There was no other suitable replacement anywhere.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ anyi si sɔ ɖe eteƒe le afi aɖeke o.
Tell us where you are.	Gblɔ afi si nèle na mí.
In many ways.	Le mɔ geɖe nu.
Which could be a good thing.	Nusi ate ŋu anye nu nyui aɖe.
However, this is not the case here.	Ke hã, mele alea le afisia o.
I just thought it was awesome.	Ðeko mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I wasn’t the one playing anything.	Menye nyee nye amesi nɔ naneke ƒom o.
He made a mistake.	Ewɔ vodada aɖe.
It’s just a lot of work to get to this point.	Dɔ geɖe koe wònye be mava ɖo afisia.
I was smarter than them.	Medze aɖaŋu wu wo.
I’m not doing anything.	Nyemele naneke wɔm o.
I guess that means it doesn’t exist.	Mesusu be ema fia be meli o.
He never doubted what it was.	Meke ɖi nusi wònye gbeɖe o.
It is the opposite.	Enye nusi tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
This is a side effect.	Esia nye akpa aɖe si kpe ɖe eŋu.
I couldn’t eat anything.	Nyemete ŋu ɖu naneke o.
This is incredibly good news.	Esia nye nya nyui aɖe si mexɔ se o.
Look at that kid.	Kpɔ ɖevi ma ɖa.
This is the perfect time.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi si sɔ nyuie.
You could do something like this.	Àte ŋu awɔ nane si le abe esia ene.
And thank you!!.	Eye akpe na wò!!.
Water.	Metsi.
He was calm again.	Eƒe dzi dze eme ake.
He couldn’t control it.	Mete ŋu ɖu edzi o.
I am the one who has come back to life.	Nyee nye ame si trɔ gbɔ va agbe me.
I'm pretty sure he's alone.	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ be eya ɖeka koe li.
It created a homey atmosphere with the few systems available.	Ewɔ aƒeme nɔnɔme aɖe kple ɖoɖo ʋɛ siwo li.
Instead of this.	Le esia teƒe la.
Nobody attacked him or anything.	Ame aɖeke medze edzi alo naneke o.
This is incredibly impossible.	Esia nye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o si mexɔ se o.
I threw up my food today.	Metsɔ nye nuɖuɖu ƒu gbe egbea.
He wasn’t expecting that.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na ema o.
Or one of them.	Alo wo dometɔ ɖeka.
I will probably do that.	Anɔ eme be mawɔe nenema.
Let me tell you something.	Mina magblɔ nya aɖe na mi.
Just a little bit.	Nu sue aɖe ko.
It looks a lot like this.	Edze abe esia ene ŋutɔ.
What to do.	Nusi woawɔ.
Perhaps it is the same.	Ðewohĩ nenema ke wòle.
I know you can do it.	Menya be àte ŋu awɔe.
Use your first and last name.	Zã wò ŋkɔ gbãtɔ kple mamlɛtɔ.
I wasn’t sure what would happen.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi ava dzɔ dzi o.
And they are like that.	Eye wole nenema.
I really put everything into it, everything about myself.	Metsɔ nusianu de eme ŋutɔŋutɔ, nusianu si ku ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu.
I saw things differently.	Mekpɔ nuwo le mɔ bubu nu.
The police have no idea what to do.	Kpovitɔwo ƒe susu mele nusi woawɔ ŋu o.
But the opposite seems to have happened.	Gake edze abe nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ ene.
They were covered in blood.	Ʋu ƒo ɖe wo ŋu.
I do something wrong.	Mewɔa nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
What for this moment.	Nukae na ɣeyiɣi sia.
And not by a little.	Eye menye to vi aɖe dzi o.
This is definitely good news.	Esia nye nya nyui aɖe godoo.
Insist that he do the same.	Te tɔ ɖe edzi be wòawɔ nenema ke.
It worked for me.	Ewɔ dɔ nam.
All of you.	Mi katã.
I didn’t see anyone.	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke o.
His gun is still up.	Eƒe tu la gakpɔtɔ le dzi.
We can learn a lot.	Míate ŋu anya nu geɖe.
In fact, he is one of them.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
You are this or that, a case is that or that.	Wòe nye esia alo ema, nya aɖee nye ema alo esia.
Whoever wrote this song is brilliant.	Ame sia ame si ŋlɔ ha sia la dze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ.
He couldn't muster a vague word.	Mete ŋu ƒo nya aɖe si me kɔ o nu ƒu o.
But some people are open about it.	Gake ame aɖewo ya ʋu mɔ aɖe ɖi tso eŋu.
One simple rule will not cover every situation.	Se bɔbɔe ɖeka maƒo nu tso nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe ŋu o.
I like everything about it.	Nusianu si le eme la dzɔa dzi nam.
I was very, very angry.	Medo dziku vevie ŋutɔ.
Just as he had expected.	Abe alesi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ ene.
It’s going to be a long night, though.	Anye zã didi aɖe, gake.
He doesn’t know these people.	Menya ame siawo o.
He never expected that.	Mekpɔ mɔ nenema kpɔ o.
It could have withstood a good thing or two.	Ate ŋu anɔ te ɖe nu nyui ɖeka alo eve nu hafi.
He is going to use you.	Ele wò zã ge.
He might be wrong about that.	Ðewohĩ awɔ vodada le nya ma ŋu.
There are other possibilities.	Nu bubu siwo ate ŋu anɔ anyi hã li.
Including my own.	Nye ŋutɔ tɔ hã le eme.
He wouldn’t let go.	Maɖe asi le eŋu o.
Not after last night.	Menye le zã si va yi megbe o.
We can help with that.	Míate ŋu akpe asi ɖe ema ŋu.
If he can believe it.	Ne ate ŋu axɔ edzi ase.
Let me do the work.	Na mawɔ dɔ.
Somewhere in the country.	Le afi aɖe.
The dog was obviously pleased.	Edze ƒã be edzɔ dzi na avu la.
I just can’t be that foresighted.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu akpɔ nu do ŋgɔ nenema gbegbe o.
Eventually being unable to speak as a result.	Mlɔeba be nyemete ŋu ƒoa nu o le esia ta.
I heard his voice at once.	Mese eƒe gbe zi ɖeka.
I was very worried.	Metsi dzi ŋutɔ.
A new era has begun.	Ɣeyiɣi yeye aɖe dze egɔme.
Nobody really cares.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
That’s what our people don’t know.	Emae nye nusi míaƒe amewo menya o.
If you can just do it.	Ne àte ŋui ko.
It is with a lot of things.	Enye kple nu geɖe.
It’s contagious.	Enye nusi xɔa ame me.
I would be happy in a way.	Adzɔ dzi nam le mɔ aɖe nu.
That was only a few years ago.	Ƒe ʋɛ aɖewo koe nye ema va yi.
Maybe he'll do something like that.	Ðewohĩ awɔ nane si le abe ema ene.
In a way, he was tired.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, ɖeɖi te eŋu.
Only he never got there.	Ðeko eya koe meɖo afima kpɔ o.
He becomes interested in something new.	Nu yeye aɖe va dzɔa dzi nɛ.
I don’t know how to proceed.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ ayi edzi o.
No good, maybe.	Nu nyui aɖeke meli o, ɖewohĩ.
When they are watching us.	Ne wole mía kpɔm.
That would be great.	Ema anyo ŋutɔ.
We know that everyone can achieve a better life.	Míenya be amesiame ate ŋu aɖo agbe si nyo wu gbɔ.
I just got just one.	Ðeko mexɔ ɖeka ko.
I am a reasonable person.	Nyee nye ame si si susu le.
I was almost hit by a car.	Ʋu aɖe va ƒom kloe.
Find a small stone.	Di kpe sue aɖe.
He had never offended her.	Medo dziku nɛ kpɔ o.
It was almost one in the afternoon.	Ŋdɔ ga ɖeka kloe ye nye ema.
You think that’s amazing.	Èsusu be esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
We are not going backwards.	Míele megbe yim o.
It’s also great.	Enye gã hã.
He never had a job.	Dɔ aɖeke menɔ esi kpɔ o.
It worked well for us.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie na mí.
But he won’t do that.	Gake mawɔe nenema o.
That seems like a good idea.	Ema dze abe susu nyui ene.
Not much, really.	Menye nu geɖe o, le nyateƒe me.
Tell me everything, every last little thing.	Gblɔ nusianu nam, nu sue mamlɛtɔ ɖesiaɖe nam.
He never let me go.	Meɖe asi le ŋunye gbeɖe o.
It’s not that I don’t have it.	Menye ɖe mele eŋu o.
I give you my word for that.	Metsɔ nye nya na wò ɖe ema ta.
Maybe two months.	Ðewohĩ ɣleti eve.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
Same kind from before.	Ƒomevi ma ke tso tsã.
But he had to be alone.	Gake ele be eya ɖeka nanɔ anyi.
But for himself.	Gake na eya ŋutɔ.
However, the whole thing.	Ke hã, nu bliboa katã.
But I worked on it.	Gake mewɔ dɔ le eŋu.
Someone who has changed.	Ame aɖe si trɔ.
The bullet was two feet from his head.	Tu la didi tso eƒe ta gbɔ afɔ eve.
But not very many people.	Gake menye ame geɖe ŋutɔ o.
He is there now.	Ele afima fifia.
There is a path for everyone.	Mɔ aɖe li na amesiame.
Get out and inside.	Do go kple eme.
He hasn’t done any yet.	Mewɔ ɖeke haɖe o.
But look at us now.	Gake kpɔ mí ɖa azɔ.
Now come on.	Azɔ va.
He could never figure out what to do about them.	Mete ŋu bu nusi wòawɔ tso wo ŋu gbeɖe o.
Some do very very well.	Ame aɖewo wɔa dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
That is quite a point.	Ema nye nya aɖe ŋutɔ.
The gun is one thing.	Tu la nye nu ɖeka.
In the process, it worked to his advantage.	Le dɔa me la, ewɔ dɔ ɖe vi nɛ.
The truth is a little more clear.	Nyateƒea me kɔ vie wu.
I built this system.	Nyee tu ɖoɖo sia ɖo.
Nothing depends on what has gone on in the past.	Naneke menɔ te ɖe nusi yi edzi va yi dzi o.
I couldn’t concentrate either.	Nye hã nyemete ŋu tsɔ nye susu ɖo nu ŋu o.
There is always more.	Nu geɖe wu nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi.
I remembered it.	Meɖo ŋku edzi.
We have food to eat.	Nuɖuɖu le mía si.
The task is actually simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, dɔa le bɔbɔe.
I'll be here tomorrow.	Mava afisia etsɔ.
Everything came to an end.	Nuwo katã va wu enu.
We are a part of that.	Míenye ema ƒe akpa aɖe.
Consider what he is doing now.	Bu nusi wɔm wòle fifia ŋu kpɔ.
No one said anything.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Talk to someone.	Ƒo nu na ame aɖe.
If anything, things have progressed in a different direction.	Ne nane li la, ke nuwo yi ŋgɔ le mɔ bubu nu.
And very quickly.	Eye kaba ŋutɔ.
It’s a dog’s character.	Enye avu ƒe nɔnɔme.
I can see you for who you really are.	Mate ŋu akpɔ wò le alesi nènye ŋutɔŋutɔ nu.
It is very small.	Ele sue ŋutɔ.
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
No one ever believed him.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ edzi se kpɔ o.
Which is the truth doesn’t matter.	Nukae nye nyateƒea mehiã o.
A good meal.	Nuɖuɖu nyui aɖe.
They have a long road ahead of them.	Mɔ didi aɖe le wo ŋgɔ.
We don’t know his character.	Míenya eƒe nɔnɔme o.
He didn’t know what he had, but he didn’t care.	Menya nusi le esi o, gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
My attitude is so good.	Nye nɔnɔme nyo ale gbegbe.
This is better than that.	Esia nyo wu.
So far, no one has found one.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ame aɖeke mekpɔ ɖeka o.
No one knows what will happen to him.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi ava dzɔ ɖe edzi o.
But it’s definitely awesome.	Gake ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ godoo.
Do a better job.	Wɔ dɔ si nyo wu.
Had a little, but not much.	Na vi aɖe nɔ esi, gake menye nu geɖe o.
I have a good idea.	Susu nyui aɖe le asinye.
He might have something there.	Ðewohĩ nane anɔ esi le afima.
Two months later, no one knew where he was.	Le ɣleti eve megbe la, ame aɖeke menya afi si wòle o.
Promise it will be quick.	Do ŋugbe be awɔ kaba.
Which would be great.	Nusi anyo ŋutɔ.
We can try it.	Míate ŋu ate kpɔ.
I’ve seen that face somewhere.	Mekpɔ mo ma le afi aɖe kpɔ.
He is not at home.	Mele aƒeme o.
But we have a different kind of blood.	Gake ʋu ƒomevi bubu aɖe le mía si.
There is nothing there.	Naneke mele afima o.
But let me tell you something.	Gake na magblɔ nya aɖe na wò.
What matters is life.	Nusi le vevie enye agbe.
We are going to talk about this problem at length.	Míele nu ƒom tso kuxi sia ŋu didi ŋutɔ.
It’s more of an opportunity.	Enye mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe wu.
Not another dead end.	Menye mɔ kuku bubu aɖeke o.
I am working tomorrow.	Mele dɔ wɔm etsɔ.
The life of this household, as it were.	Aƒe sia me ame ƒe agbe, abe alesi wòle ene.
There is no reason for this.	Susu aɖeke mele esia ŋu o.
I liked that.	Edzɔ dzi nam nenema.
That's me.	Nyee nye ema.
They have everything.	Nusianu le wo si.
I heard there was a problem coming.	Mese be kuxi aɖe gbɔna.
I had to be there.	Ele be manɔ afima.
But how do you do that.	Gake aleke nàwɔ awɔ emae.
More than that happened.	Nu geɖe wu ema dzɔ.
He never did anything wrong.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke kpɔ o.
But he didn’t stay there long.	Gake menɔ afima eteƒe didi o.
Look at what you’ve done.	Kpɔ nusi nèwɔ ɖa.
Approach him with that.	Te ɖe eŋu kple ema.
There is someone.	Ame aɖe li.
It has never been like that.	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o.
And that’s fine, actually.	Eye esia nyo, le nyateƒe me.
Just as you can yourself.	Abe alesi wò ŋutɔ hã ate ŋui ene.
Deal with them.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu.
Maybe I can help.	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu.
Still no great idea.	Susu gã aɖeke mele eŋu kokoko o.
It’s the morning one.	Enye ŋdi me tɔ.
In fact, maybe more than ever.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ wu tsã.
Only in this moment.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me ko.
He can’t go on.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi o.
I always do this.	Mewɔa esia ɣesiaɣi.
So tell me the truth.	Eya ta gblɔ nyateƒea nam.
His long face was a voice.	Eƒe mo didi la nye gbe aɖe.
Please take a look at it.	Taflatse lé ŋku ɖe eŋu.
I hope we don’t have to do this in the winter.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mehiã be míawɔ esia le dzomeŋɔli o.
Several factors could explain this.	Nu geɖe ate ŋu aɖe esia me.
I can tell you what to do with that.	Mate ŋu agblɔ nusi nàwɔ kple ema na wò.
Impossible.	Mate ŋu adzɔ o.
In fact, we would be very happy.	Le nyateƒe me la, adzɔ dzi na mí ŋutɔ.
Which he doesn’t care about.	Nusi ŋu metsɔ ɖeke le o.
Still, it’s a good idea.	Ke hã, enye susu nyui aɖe.
Everyone has a chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ le amesiame si.
I need more and more.	Mehiã nu geɖe wu.
I would have, these days.	Anye ne mewɔe nenema, le ŋkeke siawo me.
He did a good job.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie aɖe.
It’s more complex.	Enye nusi me kɔ wu.
I remembered it.	Meɖo ŋku edzi.
Clearly something bad happened.	Edze ƒã be nu gbegblẽ aɖe dzɔ.
Time was and time was not.	Ɣeyiɣi nɔ anyi eye ɣeyiɣi hã menɔ nenema o.
I don’t know anything about it.	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o.
I have never, ever felt this way about any other man.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me alea le ŋutsu bubu aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o, nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ o.
But no one seems to know where he is.	Gake edze abe ame aɖeke menya afi si wòle o ene.
One other person survived.	Ame ɖeka bubu aɖe hã tsi agbe.
It has no characteristics.	Nɔnɔme aɖeke mele eŋu o.
I save you all for this very possibility.	Meɖe mi katã ta le esia tututu si ate ŋu adzɔ ta.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
The morning was amazing.	Ŋdi la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It hasn’t been able to function properly.	Mete ŋu wɔ dɔ nyuie haɖe o.
But we can do something about this.	Gake míate ŋu awɔ nane tso esia ŋu.
I've never heard of you before.	Nyemese wò ŋkɔ kpɔ haɖe o.
Or at least let him get close.	Alo na wòate ɖe eŋu ya teti.
Take care.	Lé be nɛ.
I am not ready for this.	Nyemele klalo na esia o.
Do the work.	Wɔ dɔa.
That’s my joy.	Emae nye nye dzidzɔ.
There is still time to do something.	Ɣeyiɣi gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ nane.
Not at all.	Menye nenema kura o.
Or maybe because of it.	Alo ɖewohĩ le esia ta.
I shouldn’t lie.	Mele be magblɔ alakpa o.
It’s so obvious.	Edze ƒã ale gbegbe.
True.	Nyateƒe.
Something will take its place.	Nane axɔ ɖe eteƒe.
I will speak.	Maƒo nu.
He didn’t really care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I would look for any one that would help me.	Madi ɖeka si akpe ɖe ŋunye la dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
I don’t think that’s true.	Nyemesusu be esia nye nyateƒe o.
I don’t have a head for this.	Ta mele asinye na esia o.
That’s a good thing.	Nya nyui aɖee nye ema.
My town is very small.	Nye du la le sue ŋutɔ.
You have kind of a situation here.	Nɔnɔme aɖe ƒomevi le asiwò le afisia.
Some of them were not very happy with what they were seeing.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo mekpɔ dzidzɔ boo ɖe nusi kpɔm wole ŋu o.
It’s what’s in your heart.	Enye nusi le wò dzi me.
But in this case, it doesn’t matter.	Gake le go sia me la, mehiã o.
And now he will never let go.	Eye fifia maɖe asi le eŋu gbeɖe o.
At that point, he didn’t care.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
It was a long road.	Mɔ didi aɖee wònye.
I actually kind of liked it.	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ dzi nam le mɔ aɖe nu.
I know every dog’s name.	Menya avu ɖesiaɖe ƒe ŋkɔ.
In fact, he didn’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
Something else to work on.	Nu bubu aɖe si ŋu woawɔ dɔ le.
It's going on over and over in his mind.	Ele edzi yim zi gbɔ zi geɖe le eƒe susu me.
I got out of everything.	Medo le nusianu me.
More on the point,.	Nu geɖe wu le nya la ŋu,.
I don’t know what to say.	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ o.
But it could have been better.	Gake ate ŋu anyo wu hafi.
Everyone seems worried about it now.	Edze abe amesiame tsi dzi ɖe eŋu fifia ene.
But there will be some new features.	Gake nu yeye aɖewo anɔ eme.

He can find it again and again.	Ate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
He enjoys this work very much.	Dɔ sia dzɔa dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
It was incredible.	Enye nusi mexɔ se o.
I wondered if he was tired again.	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖeɖi te eŋu ake hã.
I liked that idea.	Susu ma dze ŋunye.
And it’s all coming soon.	Eye wo katã gbɔna kpuie.
They just stared at each other.	Ðeko ŋku nɔ wo nɔewo ŋu.
There are many reasons for this problem.	Nu geɖe tso kuxi sia gbɔ.
The people in this city are very welcoming.	Ame siwo le du sia me la xɔa ame nyuie ŋutɔ.
That would be too much.	Ema anye nusi gbɔ eme akpa.
This is important for a few reasons.	Esia le vevie le susu ʋɛ aɖewo ta.
A lot has happened today.	Nu geɖe dzɔ egbea.
This makes sense.	Esia me susu le.
I just saved everybody.	Ðeko meɖe amesiame.
The search was amazing.	Nuwo didi la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I was very happy with it.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ɖe eŋu.
I put my hand over my heart.	Metsɔ nye asi ɖo nye dzi ŋu.
It just won’t do it.	Ðeko mawɔe o.
You can join us!.	Àte ŋu awɔ ɖeka kpli mí!.
Please go here.	Taflatse yi afisia.
Now when I’m running the project, it’s not working.	Fifia ne me le dɔa wɔm la, mele dɔ wɔm o.
Others before him managed to handle that.	Ame bubu siwo do ŋgɔ nɛ la te ŋu kpɔ ema gbɔ.
In a kind of way.	Le ƒomevi aɖe me.
But he was so tired.	Gake ɖeɖi te eŋu ale gbegbe.
We can’t give you everything you want.	Míate ŋu ana nusianu si nèdi la wò o.
And thank you, guys.	Eye akpe na wò.
I quit my job.	Meɖe asi le nye dɔa ŋu.
It is a very useful strategy.	Enye aɖaŋu si aɖe vi ŋutɔ.
A building collapsed.	Xɔ aɖe ge dze anyi.
Something is what it is and nothing else.	Nu aɖe nye nusi wònye ke menye nu bubu aɖeke o.
Not in a man’s house.	Menye ŋutsu ƒe aƒe me o.
But we can say more.	Gake míate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe wu.
I saw his full name, for the first time.	Mekpɔ eƒe ŋkɔ bliboa, zi gbãtɔ.
Once in a while.	Zi ɖeka zi ɖeka.
And he can do that.	Eye ate ŋu awɔe nenema.
I'd rather see anything else.	Anyo nam wu be makpɔ nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
I’d love to talk to you today if you’re there.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be maƒo nu kpli wò egbea ne èle afima.
It makes a lot of sense to do that too.	Susu le eme ŋutɔ be woawɔ ema hã.
That’s what it’s there for.	Ema tae wòle afima ɖo.
He couldn’t understand it.	Mete ŋu se egɔme o.
He can fight.	Ate ŋu awɔ avu.
It is the simplest of them all.	Enye esi le bɔbɔe wu le wo katã dome.
Not much in them.	Menye nu geɖe le wo me o.
That’s similar to each other.	Ema sɔ kple mía nɔewo.
In the mind of a person.	Le susu me na ame.
This device is unable to operate.	Mɔ̃ sia mete ŋu wɔa dɔ o.
He fell down at once.	Edze anyi zi ɖeka.
It must be you.	Ele be wòe.
Nothing seems to have reached any price.	Edze abe naneke meɖo asi aɖeke dzi o ene.
His eyes returned to the road ahead.	Eƒe ŋku trɔ yi mɔ si le ŋgɔ nɛ la dzi.
Maybe that’s right.	Ðewohĩ nya ma sɔ.
And we had no children.	Eye vi aɖeke menɔ mía si o.
Something, someone was there with him.	Nane, ame aɖe nɔ afima kplii.
It would have killed many of us.	Anye ne awu mía dometɔ geɖe hafi.
He can’t know anything about this.	Mate ŋu anya naneke tso esia ŋu o.
The police car was nearby.	Kpovitɔwo ƒe ʋua nɔ teƒe si te ɖe afima ŋu.
He didn’t find any.	Mekpɔ ɖeke o.
It’s not too late yet.	Metsi megbe akpa haɖe o.
I will do the job.	Mawɔ dɔa.
Its about an idea.	Eƒe ku ɖe susu aɖe ŋu.
But the night came.	Gake zã do.
But not in isolation.	Gake menye ɖe vovo o.
But the reality is quite different.	Gake nyateƒea to vovo kura.
That place had no name either.	Ŋkɔ aɖeke menɔ teƒe ma hã ŋu o.
It doesn’t really make any sense.	Susu aɖeke mele eme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I couldn’t put them together.	Nyemete ŋu ƒo wo nu ƒu o.
No one said anything about them.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke tso wo ŋu o.
And he lived by it.	Eye wònɔ agbe ɖe enu.
This work is still in progress.	Dɔ sia gakpɔtɔ le edzi yim.
He couldn’t tell.	Mete ŋu nya o.
Yet weeks passed.	Ke hã kwasiɖa geɖe va yi.
It doesn’t seem necessary.	Edze abe mehiã o ene.
I want you to do well in your life.	Medi be nàwɔ nu nyuie le wò agbe me.
I can’t go on my own.	Nyemate ŋu ayi le ɖokuinye si o.
Turn your back on us.	Trɔ megbe na mí.
I got a job.	Mexɔ dɔ aɖe.
Say, once a week.	Gblɔ be, zi ɖeka le kwasiɖa me.
I have to fight them.	Ele nam be mawɔ avu kpli wo.
Can someone tell me how to do it.	Ðe ame aɖe ate ŋu agblɔ alesi mawɔe nam.
I knew exactly what to expect.	Menya nusi tututu makpɔ mɔ na.
And there were four men in it.	Eye ŋutsu ene nɔ eme.
And he doesn’t always do that.	Eye mewɔa nu nenema ɣesiaɣi o.
Just one place.	Teƒe ɖeka ko.
This usually means you have to create your own type.	Zi geɖe la, esia fia be ele be nàwɔ wò ŋutɔ wò ƒomevi.
That’s kind of a mistake.	Ema nye vodada aɖe ƒomevi.
I can’t get over it as it is now.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo edzi abe alesi wòle fifia ene o.
I didn’t really understand.	Nyemese egɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He just sat there.	Ðeko wònɔ anyi ɖe afima.
Everyone, stay.	Ame sia ame, nanɔ anyi.
But he had another side that was completely different.	Gake akpa bubu aɖe nɔ esi si to vovo kura.
In this case, the.	Le esia me la.
Some other things, too.	Nu bubu aɖewo hã.
He was very much in tune with them.	Ewɔ ɖeka kpli wo ŋutɔ.
He can be talking to anyone.	Ate ŋu anɔ nu ƒom na ame sia ame.
The fire in the background.	Dzo si le megbe.
Probably nothing more.	Ðewohĩ naneke manɔ eme wu ema o.
The first from real life.	Gbãtɔ tso agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ me.
I’m happy about that too.	Edzɔ dzi nam ɖe ema hã ŋu.
That’s enough for me.	Ema sɔ gbɔ nam.
And it’s a simple thing.	Eye enye nu bɔbɔe aɖe.
You can’t control people.	Màte ŋu aɖu amewo dzi o.
Something wasn’t right here.	Nane menɔ anyi nyuie le afisia o.
It just worked out that way.	Ðeko wòwɔ dɔ nenema.
But it still has some problems.	Gake kuxi aɖewo gakpɔtɔ le eŋu.
You know better than that.	Ènya nu nyuie wu ema.
I had money.	Ga nɔ asinye.
I don’t think it matters.	Mesusu be mehiã o.
I don’t have to go on.	Mehiã be mayi edzi o.
He couldn’t do anything else.	Mete ŋu wɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
The first is just something to do.	Gbãtɔ nye nane si woawɔ ko.
Look for the word.	Di nya la ɖa.
From another place.	Tso teƒe bubu.
Talk!	Ƒo nu!
He was a great guy to work for.	Enye ŋutsu gã aɖe si wòle be woawɔ dɔ na.
The reality is quite the opposite.	Nyateƒea to vovo kura na ema.
I expressed my opinion.	Megblɔ nye susu.
But someone fired a shot.	Gake ame aɖe da tu.
There was great excitement.	Dzidzɔ gã aɖe nɔ anyi.
Hold on to the point.	Lé nya la me ɖe asi.
It is going to take a long time.	Ele ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe xɔ ge.
I could remember it like it was yesterday.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi abe etsɔ ene.
Everything was going better.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie wu.
That would be exciting.	Ema ado dzidzɔ na ame.
Speak a little bit.	Ƒo nu vie.
But he is on our side.	Gake ele míaƒe akpa dzi.
The same is still the same.	Nu ma ke gakpɔtɔ nye nu ma ke.
I had to get out of there, and hurry.	Ele be mado le afima, eye mawɔ kaba.
He will find that someone.	Akpɔ ame aɖe ma.
More than more money.	Nu geɖe wu ga geɖe wu.
Not necessarily, anyway.	Menye kokoko o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
But we know the past.	Gake míenya nu siwo dzɔ va yi.
Something was obviously bothering him.	Edze ƒã be nane nɔ fu ɖem nɛ.
But that doesn’t matter.	Gake ema mehiã o.
Fire was eating through the room.	Dzo nɔ nu ɖum to xɔa me.
I was worried about it.	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu.
I was so worried about it.	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe.
People lost their lives.	Amewo ƒe agbe bu.
This is a lie, of course.	Esia nye alakpa ya.
All the way through.	Mɔ bliboa katã.
The dust has now settled down.	Ke la ƒo ɖe anyi fifia.
You have your meeting.	Wò kpekpea le asiwò.
I agreed with him.	Mewɔ ɖeka kplii.
I have seen a few like this.	Mekpɔ ame ʋɛ aɖewo abe esia ene.
Many people have died here.	Ame geɖe ku le afisia.
This can happen to anyone including you.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe amesiame dzi wò hã le eme.
He couldn’t see them.	Mete ŋu kpɔ wo o.
Everything was fine, everything was fine.	Nusianu nɔ nyuie, nuwo katã nɔ nyuie.
There is a lot to do here.	Nu geɖe li woawɔ le afisia.
Please have a manya.	Taflatse na manya.
Go back after this.	Trɔ yi esia megbe.
There is something between us.	Nane le mía dome.
Make a few.	Wɔ ʋɛ aɖewo.
He liked that idea.	Susu ma dze eŋu.
No gun does that.	Tu aɖeke mewɔa esia o.
Maybe I'm missing something here.	Ðewohĩ nane tom le afisia.
I hope you all enjoy it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na mi katã.
We need to act quickly.	Ele be míawɔ nu kaba.
I got them.	Mexɔ wo.
Spend some time with some of them.	Zã ɣeyiɣi aɖe ɖe wo dometɔ aɖewo ŋu.
Not for him.	Menye nɛ o.
Now it’s private.	Fifia enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
There is no other reason.	Susu bubu aɖeke meli o.
Nothing and no one had ever been like that.	Naneke kple ame aɖeke menɔ anyi nenema kpɔ o.
Each one is different.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
That was a long time ago.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
That used to be different.	Ema to vovo tsã.
It’s all on its own.	Wo katã le eɖokui si.
One person died, but the building survived.	Ame ɖeka ku, gake xɔa ya tsi agbe.
He couldn't think of that.	Mete ŋu bu nya ma ŋu o.
It was normal for me at least.	Enye nusi sɔ nam ya teti.
But also my own.	Gake nye ŋutɔ tɔ hã.
Some of my teachers are really important to me.	Nye nufiala aɖewo le vevie nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There is nothing we can do.	Naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ o.
I work with this system as well.	Mewɔa dɔ kple ɖoɖo sia hã.
I just can’t reach them.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖo wo gbɔ o.
I told my truth and no one believed me.	Megblɔ nye nyateƒe eye ame aɖeke mexɔ dzinye se o.
I thought it was a great idea, and it worked really well.	Mesusu be enye susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ, eye wòwɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
Everyone here heard yesterday accuse you.	Ame sia ame si le afi sia se etsɔ nya ɖe ŋuwò.
What they are doing today is important.	Nu siwo wɔm wole egbea la le vevie.
You can’t be here without it.	Màte ŋu anɔ afisia ema manɔmee o.
We could have done more.	Míate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe wu hafi.
No one knows how many.	Ame aɖeke menya nenie o.
It was a dreary, unhappy day.	Enye ŋkeke si dzi nu te ɖo, si dzi dzidzɔ menɔ o.
Go to your heart.	Yi na wò dzi.
He can talk to anyone.	Ate ŋu aƒo nu kple ame sia ame.
I got this error.	Mexɔ vodada sia.
we can’t go.	míate ŋu ayi o.
He couldn’t get any air.	Mete ŋu xɔ ya aɖeke o.
Get rid of everything.	Ðe nusianu ɖa.
It’s not my head.	Menye nye tae o.
I can talk to him really well now.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu kplii nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ fifia.
I made a mistake.	Mewɔ vodada aɖe.
But this doesn’t work.	Gake esia mewɔa dɔ o.
If he does something wrong, we have to deal with him.	Ne ewɔ nu gbegblẽ la, ele be míawɔ nu kplii.
His anger was building.	Eƒe dziku va nɔ edzi yim.
Every man is important.	Ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe le vevie.
There could be several reasons for that.	Susu geɖe ate ŋu anɔ ema ta.
This can be done.	Esia ate ŋu awɔe.
That’s good news for me.	Ema nye nya nyui aɖe nam.
Look forward to checking this book out!.	Kpɔ mɔ be yeakpɔ agbalẽ sia ɖa!.
I can handle that.	Mate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ.
Not that he could have it anyway.	Menye be ate ŋu anɔ esi le mɔ sia mɔ nu o.
No wonder he lost his head.	Mewɔ nuku o be eƒe ta bu.
That wasn’t like him either.	Ema hã menɔ abe eya ene o.
So, a lot of time and hard work is needed.	Eya ta, ɣeyiɣi kple dɔ sesẽ geɖe hiã.
I don’t see anything about that.	Nyemekpɔ naneke le nya ma ŋu o.
But there was nothing beyond the nearby buildings.	Gake naneke menɔ anyi wu xɔ siwo te ɖe afima ŋu o.
There is a chance he can win.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ li be wòate ŋu aɖu dzi.
There is nothing new in that.	Nu yeye aɖeke mele ema me o.
But it will do that.	Gake awɔe nenema.
A year later, that changed dramatically.	Le ƒe ɖeka megbe la, ema trɔ kura.
Work of any kind.	Dɔ ɖesiaɖe ƒomevi.
In the longer term.	Le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe wu me.
On the other hand.	Le go bubu me la.
And each other.	Eye wo nɔewo.
He won’t have our backs.	Míaƒe megbe manɔ esi o.
I'm not really well.	Nyemele nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This will explain.	Esia aɖe eme.
Every one of them is good.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe nyo.
Who knows what.	Amekae nya nusi.
That's probably good for now.	Anɔ eme be ema nyo fifia.
His death was difficult for me.	Eƒe ku sesẽ nam.
I just don’t understand why you want to do this.	Ðeko nyemese nusita nèdi be yeawɔ esia gɔme o.
I just told myself that.	Ðeko megblɔ na ɖokuinye nenema.
I can’t do anything about it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso eŋu o.
Or something like that.	Alo nane si le abe ema ene.
That makes better sense.	Susu le nya ma me nyuie wu.
But he couldn’t do anything.	Gake mete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
I know what it’s like.	Menya alesi wòle.
That you are happy and doing well.	Be dzi dzɔ wò eye nèle edzi dzem nyuie.
Or anything else for that matter.	Alo nu bubu ɖesiaɖe le nya ma ta.
You can find that here and here.	Àte ŋu akpɔ ema le afisia kple afisia.
Everything is dead.	Nusianu ku.
What works for you, works for you.	Nusi wɔa dɔ na wò la, wɔa dɔ na wò.
I do this a lot.	Mewɔa esia geɖe ŋutɔ.
But one came out.	Gake ɖeka do go.
This really annoys me.	Esia doa dziku nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s just my name.	Nye ŋkɔ koe.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
A reasonable face.	Mo si me susu le.
Everything is over.	Nusianu wu enu.
For a good reason.	Le susu nyui aɖe ta.
I don’t want to do it.	Nyemedi be mawɔe o.
Anything is possible.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
It seemed kind of.	Edze abe ɖe wònye ƒomevi aɖe ene.
Be a consistent person.	Nye ame si wɔa nu ɣesiaɣi.
The death toll was very high.	Ame siwo ku la sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
Some people do a little bit.	Ame aɖewo wɔa nu vi aɖe.
That’s a very interesting thing.	Ema nye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t answer at all.	Mete ŋu ɖo eŋu kura o.
I hope this is the case.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia le nenema.
He didn’t say much.	Megblɔ nya geɖe o.
We know very little about the outcome.	Míenya nu boo aɖeke tso nusi ado tso eme ŋu o.
Raise your hand if you have a problem.	Do asi ɖe dzi ne kuxi aɖe le ŋuwò.
I need some help.	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo.
I have two wonderful men.	Ŋutsu nyui eve le asinye.
I want to talk more.	Medi be maƒo nu geɖe wu.
That feels like a big deal.	Ema se le eɖokui me abe nya gã aɖe ene.
No one cares what you think.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le nusi nèsusu me o.
If necessary, kill them.	Ne ehiã la, wu wo.
Police eventually found the money.	Kpovitɔwo va ke ɖe ga la ŋu mlɔeba.
Beware of the snake!	Kpɔ nyuie le da la ŋu!
And that’s what’s most important to me.	Eye emae nye nusi le vevie nam wu.
It is not a small if.	Menye ne sue aɖee wònye o.
This thread is too clever for me anyway.	Ka sia dze aɖaŋu akpa nam le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
He put respect on her.	Etsɔ bubu da ɖe edzi.
It seemed a little strange.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku vie ene.
Everything you have is new.	Nusianu si le asiwò la nye nu yeye.
You’re not helping me.	Mèle kpekpeɖeŋu nam o.
And yet, it’s not really that simple.	Eye ke hã, menye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I knew where he was the whole time.	Menya afisi wòle ɣeyiɣi bliboa katã.
He never told me who.	Megblɔ ame kae nam kpɔ o.
Look at what’s under your feet, under you.	Kpɔ nu si le wò afɔ te, le wò te la ɖa.
But, there is no extreme case, and this is no exception.	Gake, nya aɖeke meli si gbɔ eme o, eye esia hã mele eme o.
Nothing on this yet.	Naneke mele nya sia ŋu haɖe o.
This is all we have to do.	Esia koe nye míaƒe dɔ.
Expose you for a month.	Ðe wò ɖe go ɣleti ɖeka.
The same cheap price.	Asi bɔbɔe ma ke.
He didn’t trust anyone.	Meka ɖe ame aɖeke dzi o.
It was a beautiful place.	Teƒe nyui aɖee wònye.
I have to go on a diet.	Ele be mayi nuɖuɖu aɖe dzi.
It didn’t surprise him.	Mewɔ nuku nɛ o.
Anything else, and my hair melts.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe, eye nye ɖa ƒoa ƒu.
The police came anyway.	Kpovitɔwo va to mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Your hair is still wet.	Wò ɖa gakpɔtɔ le tsi.
I think that’s a good thing.	Mesusu be nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
There had never been anyone else.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
They are smaller than you.	Wole sue wu wò.
The king ruled on his own.	Fia la ɖu dzi le eɖokui si.
It was as if they were waiting for something.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe wole nane lalam ene.
And that’s not a bad thing.	Eye ema menye nu gbegblẽ o.
I'd rather go with you.	Anyo nam wu be mayi kpli wò.
He has a lot to do.	Nu geɖe le esi wòawɔ.
He was a really nice person.	Ame nyui aɖee wònye ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I have found my truth.	Meke ɖe nye nyateƒea ŋu.
Look at my previous comments.	Kpɔ nye nya siwo megblɔ va yi ɖa.
Opportunity is also impressive.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ hã wɔa dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
Many people have tried.	Ame geɖe te kpɔ.
He is not a good person.	Menye ame nyui aɖeke o.
And they liked it.	Eye edzɔ dzi na wo.
This problem seems very difficult.	Edze abe kuxi sia sesẽ ŋutɔ ene.
This assumption is flawed.	Vodada le susu sia ŋu.
I didn’t mean to do it.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔe o.
And this is amazing.	Eye esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He was the only one who didn’t.	Eya ɖeka koe mewɔe nenema o.
I felt satisfied.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme.
There has never been so little in a car.	Nu sue aɖe koe menɔ ʋu me kpɔ o.
There is absolutely no need to hurry.	Mehiã kura be woawɔ kaba o.
Come into me.	Va ge ɖe menye.
We hope to work our way throughout the summer.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be míawɔ dɔ le míaƒe mɔ dzi le dzomeŋɔli bliboa me.
Two good years.	Ƒe nyui eve.
But that’s not what this is about.	Gake menye emae nye nusi ŋu nya sia ku ɖo o.
Have a bloody heart.	Dzi si ʋu nanɔ asiwò.
It’s not working.	Menye ɖe wòle dɔ wɔm o.
Since he is here now.	Esi wòle afisia fifia ta.
I treat them differently.	Mewɔa nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu le mɔ bubu nu.
I'll let it go somehow.	Maɖe asi le eŋu le mɔ aɖe nu.
That possibility did not occur to him.	Nu ma si ate ŋu adzɔ la meva susu me nɛ o.
This part is very important.	Akpa sia le vevie ŋutɔ.
In fact, they have nothing at all.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu aɖeke mele wo si kura o.
What happened today, it’s not normal.	Nusi dzɔ egbea la, menye nusi sɔ o.
And he’s here with us.	Eye wòle afisia kpli mí.
And there is another place.	Eye teƒe bubu aɖe hã li.
Happiness came from his face.	Dzidzɔ tso eƒe mo.
Within an hour, four of them were dead.	Le gaƒoƒo ɖeka me la, wo dometɔ ene ku.
Lots of details.	Nu geɖe siwo me kɔ nyuie.
And with thank you for being.	Eye kple akpe na wò be nèle.
He usually likes his food.	Zi geɖe la, eƒe nuɖuɖu dzɔa dzi nɛ.
But finding them became difficult.	Gake wo didi va sesẽ.
Nothing wore anything else.	Naneke medo nu bubu aɖeke o.
The blood is on your hand.	Ʋua le wò asi dzi.
Only you can save them.	Wò ɖeka koe ate ŋu aɖe wo.
This will probably take something extra.	Anɔ eme be esia axɔ nane si kpe ɖe eŋu.
I know they have two children.	Menya be vi eve le wo si.
It was just something that happened.	Ðeko wònye nane si dzɔ.
Leave things as they are.	Gblẽ nuwo ɖi abe alesi wole ene.
This wasn’t the same.	Esia menɔ ɖeka o.
I had nothing to my name.	Naneke menɔ asinye le nye ŋkɔ me o.
He is getting angrier.	Ele dziku dom ɖe edzi.
If anything happens, let me know.	Ne nane dzɔ la, na manya.
You’ve been working on them for a while.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia nèle dɔ wɔm tso wo ŋu.
One last time, there will be one last chance.	Zi mamlɛtɔ, mɔnukpɔkpɔ mamlɛtɔ anɔ anyi.
He didn’t see anyone.	Mekpɔ ame aɖeke o.
Impossible.	Mate ŋu adzɔ o.
But he never really did.	Gake mewɔe nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
Need some help.	Hiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo.
But that’s over.	Gake ema wu enu.
In fact, it can actually be quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, le nyateƒe me la, ate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
And we’re funding it.	Eye míele ga dom ɖe eŋu.
Good morning to all of you.	Ŋdi nyui na mi katã.
Everyone.	Ame sia ame.
He can do no wrong.	Mate ŋu awɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
And it’s a very bad place.	Eye enye teƒe si gblẽ ŋutɔ.
Get out of it! 	Do go le eme!
No surprise there, really.	Mewɔ nuku o le afima, le nyateƒe me.
He didn’t agree with her.	Mewɔ ɖeka kplii o.
This is true in two ways.	Esia nye nyateƒe le mɔ eve nu.
At some point in time.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me.

He was obviously tired.	Edze ƒã be ɖeɖi te eŋu.
There is nothing to prove this.	Naneke meli si ɖo kpe esia dzi o.
You had a lot of help.	Kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe nɔ asiwò.
The whole thing might have been a mistake.	Ðewohĩ nu bliboa nye vodada hafi.
Now take a step forward.	Azɔ ɖe afɔ yi ŋgɔ.
Nothing like this has ever existed, nor will it ever exist.	Naneke si le abe esia ene menɔ anyi kpɔ o, eye manɔ agbe hã o.
You just don’t know.	Ðeko mènya o.
This place was perfect for him.	Teƒe sia sɔ nyuie nɛ.
He had never touched her.	Meka asi eŋu kpɔ o.
If you think that	Ne èsusu be .
Thank you very much.	Akpe na mi ŋutɔ.
You can believe whatever you like.	Àte ŋu axɔ nusianu si dze ŋuwò la dzi ase.
But its still not true by any means.	Gake eƒe kokoko menye nyateƒe le mɔ aɖeke nu o.

One of them called him this morning.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka ƒo ka nɛ ŋdi sia.
A machine can do this job.	Mɔ̃ aɖe ate ŋu awɔ dɔ sia.
I'm waiting.	Mele lalam.
Please leave a comment here.	Taflatse gblẽ nya aɖe ɖi le afisia.
Please, come inside.	Taflatse, va ge ɖe eme.
He had never been sick.	Medze dɔ kpɔ o.
You’re just in my way.	Ðeko nèle nye mɔ dzi.
Police raided the building.	Kpovitɔwo va da xɔa me.
I don’t know what could happen.	Nyemenya nusi ate ŋu adzɔ o.
That’s the part of the room.	Emae nye akpa si xɔa me.
This is a job.	Dɔ aɖee nye esia.
I fell in love with the place.	Teƒe si mekpɔ la va dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
So many rooms.	Xɔ geɖe ale gbegbe.
I need water.	Mehiã tsi.
I have so many things.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye.
I don’t know what’s wrong with it.	Nyemenya nusi gblẽ le eŋu o.
But no one else did.	Gake ame bubu aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
For the same reason.	Susu ma ke tae.
Maybe he didn’t.	Ðewohĩ mewɔe nenema o.
Just always going through everything out there.	Ðeko ɣesiaɣi to nusianu si le afima me.
That's a good thing!.	Nu nyui aɖee!.
A thousand possibilities ran through his head.	Nu akpe ɖeka siwo ate ŋu adzɔ la ƒu du to eƒe ta me.
I don’t understand how this could be.	Nyemese alesi esia ate ŋu anɔ gɔme o.
We hope you like it!.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò!.
One of us will do it.	Mía dometɔ ɖeka awɔe.
If they are, we can tell where we are.	Ne wole nenema la, míate ŋu anya afi si míele.
This house saved me.	Aƒe sia xɔ nam.
If that works.	Ne ema wɔ dɔ.
It’s not too late for me, that is.	Metsi megbe akpa nam o, si fia be.
There is a time and place for everything.	Nusianu ƒe ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe si sɔ le esi.
For the sake of his people.	Le eƒe amewo ta.
Just a little twist this way.	Trɔ ɖe eŋu vie ko le mɔ sia nu.
But just in case it happens.	Gake ne edzɔ be edzɔ ko la.
I have never seen anything more beautiful.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si nya kpɔ wu esia kpɔ o.
He is a character.	Enye ame si ƒe nɔnɔme le abe ame ene.
Always, but what’s that supposed to do.	Ɣesiaɣi, gake nukae wòle be esia nawɔ.
It’s working.	Ele dɔ wɔm.
No one can tell me what’s wrong with me.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu agblɔ nusi le fu ɖem nam la nam o.
It is a great book.	Agbalẽ gã aɖee wònye.
This makes sense, of course.	Susu le esia me ya.
Hard for the heart.	Sesẽ na dzi.
Will call him from work tomorrow.	Aƒo ka nɛ tso dɔme etsɔ.
Let him try it.	Na wòate kpɔ.
We can help!.	Míate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu!.
Or, the car could be a problem.	Alo, ʋua ate ŋu anye kuxi.
That’s a fact.	Ema nye nyateƒe.
And yet they mean so much to me.	Eye ke hã wole vevie nam ale gbegbe.
You never know what’s going to do what.	Mènya nusi awɔ nusi wɔ ge gbeɖe o.
The good and the bad.	Nu nyui kple nu gbegblẽ.
He obviously didn’t know where he was.	Edze ƒã be menya afisi wòle o.
And of course, a few situations emerged.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, nɔnɔme ʋɛ aɖewo do mo ɖa.
It’s not like it’s not stable.	Menye abe ale si meli ke o ene o.
I miss you so much.	Mesusu wò ŋutɔ.
He will be with her.	Anɔ eŋu kplii.
None of them seemed to care about him.	Edze abe wo dometɔ aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ o ene.
But he wasn't going to say anything.	Gake menɔ nya aɖeke gblɔ ge o.
And there’s a reason why.	Eye susu aɖe li si tae.
He must have been depressed.	Anɔ eme be nu te ɖe edzi.
Nobody does that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa nu ma o.
There is absolutely no room for a dog in there.	Teƒe aɖeke kura meli na avu aɖe le afima o.
I've been here too long.	Meva afisia ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
I just stood up.	Ðeko metsi tre.
I can’t seem to get rid of it.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu aɖee ɖa o ene.
But we cannot and.	Gake míate ŋui o eye.
Things have changed so much.	Nuwo trɔ ale gbegbe.
Maybe it was just a few.	Ðewohĩ ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wònye.
I can work on it.	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ le eŋu.
But this last statement is false.	Gake nya mamlɛtɔ sia nye alakpa.
It is also a strategy.	Enye aɖaŋu hã.
Many happy years lay ahead.	Dzidzɔ ƒe geɖe nɔ wo ŋgɔ.
Time was money, and people had a lot of work to do.	Ɣeyiɣi nye ga, eye dɔ geɖe nɔ amewo si woawɔ.
But we do know each other.	Gake míenya mía nɔewo ya.
No one believed him.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ edzi se o.
Everyone has to do their job.	Ele be amesiame nawɔ eƒe dɔ.
Maybe this is different.	Ðewohĩ esia to vovo.
It wasn’t eating.	Menye nu ɖum o.
And it’s important.	Eye ele vevie.
And we don’t know what to do with that.	Eye míenya nusi míawɔ kple ema o.
There’s a lot going on in it.	Nu geɖe le edzi yim le eme.
He will overcome it.	Aɖu edzi.
That’s none of my business.	Ema menye nye nya aɖeke o.
That has happened many times.	Ema dzɔ zi geɖe.
I got closer to him.	Mete ɖe eŋu wu.
And that’s a big problem.	Eye ema nye kuxi gã aɖe.
The issue that emerged reflected his anger.	Nya si do mo ɖa la ɖe eƒe dziku fia.
There must be a reason behind that.	Susu aɖe anɔ megbe na ema.
But he might like it.	Gake ɖewohĩ adzɔ dzi nɛ.
I’m worried about you.	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò.
I am doing pretty well on my own.	Mele edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔ le ɖokuinye si.
The same situation applies here.	Nɔnɔme ma ke le afisia hã.

There has to be a mistake.	Ele be vodada aɖe nanɔ anyi.
Now, you are the king.	Azɔ, wòe nye fia la.
I have to move on.	Ele be mayi ŋgɔ.
The only exception is the fresh water.	Nusi to vovo koe nye tsi nyui si le eme.
It’s an old job for them.	Enye dɔ xoxo aɖe na wo.
It could be a system.	Ate ŋu anye ɖoɖo aɖe.
Those who survived were severely damaged.	Ame siwo tsi agbe la gblẽ nu le wo ŋu vevie.
This happened over and over again.	Esia dzɔ zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I’ve done that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ.
He is testing you.	Ele wò dom kpɔ.
We’re here for the same reason, that’s pretty obvious.	Susu ma ke tae míele afisia ɖo, ema dze ƒã ŋutɔ.
Overall, it worked well.	Le nusianu me la, ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
And that’s not a good thing.	Eye esia menye nu nyui aɖeke o.
It was just that way.	Ðeko wònɔ nenema.
That means months.	Ema fia ɣleti geɖe.
That can work, too.	Ema hã ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
In this way.	Le mɔ sia nu.
There were only four.	Ene koe nɔ anyi.
It is what is in .	Enye nusi le .
He could never escape.	Mete ŋu si gbeɖe o.
Obviously, this will take some time.	Edze ƒã be esia axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I couldn’t satisfy him.	Nyemete ŋu na eƒe dzi dze eme o.
It's in a bad way.	Ele mɔ gbegblẽ aɖe nu.
Maybe something will actually happen tonight.	Ðewohĩ nane adzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ le zã sia me.
He could have had a gun.	Tu ate ŋu anɔ esi hafi.
This is different.	Esia to vovo.
Say what is needed.	Gblɔ nusi hiã.
He could not adjust it.	Mete ŋu trɔ asi le eŋu o.
Like everything about this place.	Abe nusianu si ku ɖe teƒe sia ŋu ene.
That’s one thing no one can take away from you.	Ema nye nu ɖeka si ame aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ le asiwò o.
They are just like that.	Ðeko wole nenema.
You have the whole truth and nothing but the truth on that.	Nyateƒe bliboa le asiwò eye naneke meli wu nyateƒea le ema dzi o.
That was very disturbing.	Ema ɖe fu na ame ŋutɔ.
But this isn’t surprising.	Gake esia mewɔ nuku o.
No one does this.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa esia o.
It looks fresh and vital.	Edze yeye eye wòle vevie ŋutɔ.
So many angry people.	Ame geɖe siwo do dziku ale gbegbe.

You can do whatever you want.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu sia nu si nèdi.

You didn’t seem to know what he was doing there.	Edze abe mènya nusi wɔm wònɔ le afima o ene.

Not through anyone.	Menye to ame aɖeke dzi o.
I don’t know if that’s true or not.	Nyemenya nenye be nya ma nye nyateƒe alo menye nyateƒe o.
Very little of that.	Sue aɖe ŋutɔ le ema me.
It worked really well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There is no obvious reason.	Susu aɖeke meli si dze ƒã o.

And that one guy.	Kple ŋutsu ɖeka ma.
I have to work a bit now anyway.	Ele nam be mawɔ dɔ vie fifia le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
You don’t have to create a system that does a different job.	Mehiã be nàwɔ ɖoɖo aɖe si awɔ dɔ bubu o.
I tried to figure out what was wrong.	Medze agbagba be makpɔ nusi gblẽ.

Or a member of a tribe.	Alo to aɖe me tɔ aɖe.
He didn’t know what he was doing.	Menya nusi wɔm wònɔ o.
It seemed strange to a house.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku na aƒe aɖe ene.
It was not a happy house.	Menye aƒe si me dzidzɔ le ye wònye o.
That happened before.	Ema dzɔ do ŋgɔ.
He didn’t let go of her.	Meɖe asi le eŋu o.
Please, let me go.	Meɖe kuku, na mayi.

I just don’t understand it.	Ðeko nyemese egɔme o.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
I have to do the same.	Ele be nye hã mawɔe nenema.
There is something more here.	Nane si sɔ gbɔ wu le afisia.
I'll call myself.	Maƒo ka na ɖokuinye.
Relax.	Gbɔ dzi ɖi.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
I don’t know what’s wrong with this.	Nyemenya nusi gblẽ le esia ŋu o.
Apparently not much.	Edze abe menye nu geɖe o ene.
I am going to get sick right here.	Mele dɔ lé ge le afisia tututu.
He doesn’t do it now.	Mewɔe fifia o.
There was blood on one side.	Ʋu nɔ akpa ɖeka.
This is not the case.	Esia mele nenema o.
It looked great on her.	Edze nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ le eŋu.
Things will go well.	Nuwo ava yi nyuie.
I have to get out of here.	Ele be mado le afisia.
Getting there is a little harder.	Afima ɖoɖo sesẽ vie wu.
I know exactly what will happen.	Menya nusi tututu adzɔ.
He couldn't sit down and do anything.	Mete ŋu nɔ anyi nɔ naneke wɔm o.
He had never been able to see.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nu kpɔ o.
That will help things.	Ema akpe ɖe nuwo ŋu.

When I was a child.	Esi menye ɖevi la.
There were only four people in the room.	Ame ene koe nɔ xɔa me.

Again, hours.	Le afisia hã la, gaƒoƒo geɖe.
Which way exactly is it?	Mɔ ka tututu nu le?
Also please take a look at this book.	Azɔ hã taflatse lé ŋku ɖe agbalẽ sia ŋu.

I have to keep living.	Ele be mayi edzi anɔ agbe.
But it doesn’t matter to them.	Gake mehiã na wo o.
I was just a little weird.	Menye nusi wɔ nuku nam vie ko.
You can never know what’s going to happen.	Màte ŋu anya nusi ava dzɔ gbeɖe o.
We were happy with the job we had.	Dzi dzɔ mí ya ɖe dɔ si nɔ mía si la ŋu.
Everyone knows what to do.	Amesiame nya nusi wòle be wòawɔ.
A happy horse to a happy home.	Sɔ si le dzidzɔ kpɔm yi aƒe si me dzidzɔ le me.
This cannot happen in.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ le o.
Make it work if you can.	Na wòawɔ dɔ ne àte ŋui.
Reach out to them.	Do asi ɖe wo gbɔ.
It’s not my dog.	Menye nye avu ye o.

I was expecting that.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na ema.
I want to do it for me.	Medi be mawɔe nam.
I never knew who he was.	Nyemenya amesi wònye kpɔ o.
Maybe I know something that can help you.	Ðewohĩ menya nane si ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I might have been there with him.	Ðewohĩ menɔ afima kplii hafi.
No one knows how to do that.	Ame aɖeke menya alesi woawɔ emae o.
It’s just beginning.	Edze egɔme tututu.
This happened in the following way.	Esia va dzɔ le mɔ si gbɔna nu.
Another surprise for you.	Nu bubu si wɔ nuku na wò.
Give things a chance.	Na mɔnukpɔkpɔ nuwo.
Not nearly as smart.	Medze aɖaŋu kloe o.
Two things can happen.	Nu eve ate ŋu adzɔ.
Believe me, it won’t work.	Xɔ dzinye se, mawɔ dɔ o.
In the end, it may not work for you.	Mlɔeba la, ɖewohĩ mawɔ dɔ na wò o.
And that’s too important.	Eye esia le vevie akpa.
It can’t be either of them.	Mate ŋu anye wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
I wanted to make time.	Medi be makpɔ ɣeyiɣi.
I surprised him with a new one.	Metsɔ yeye aɖe wɔ nuku nɛ.
I glanced around the room.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe xɔa me ŋu.
I was very, very nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
It was amazing, and he couldn’t understand it.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, eye mete ŋu se egɔme o.
I don’t have a problem with this.	Nyemekpɔ kuxi aɖeke le esia ŋu o.
But you can’t control what one knows.	Gake màte ŋu aɖu nusi ame nya dzi o.
I miss you so much.	Mesusu wò ŋutɔ.
People react to.	Amewo wɔa nu ɖe...
Or at least a voice.	Alo gbe aɖe ya teti.
It was a long shot.	Enye tu didi aɖe.
He can work with that.	Ate ŋu awɔ dɔ kple ema.
Like a horse.	Abe sɔ ene.
But consider the following.	Gake bu nya siwo gbɔna ŋu kpɔ.
But the police did.	Gake kpovitɔwo wɔe nenema.
Only, things didn’t work out.	Ðeko, nuwo meva yi nyuie o.
Do whatever you do.	Wɔ nu sia nu si nàwɔ.
That made me feel a little better.	Ema na mese le ɖokuinye me vie.
I just asked for more.	Ðeko mebia geɖe wu.
But now enough of the horse.	Gake fifia sɔ la sɔ gbɔ.
The crashed car was frozen.	Ʋu si ge dze anyi la xɔ dzo.
It doesn’t need to be programmed.	Mehiã be woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu o.
You can see a lot here.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe le afisia.
Where is that? 	Afikae ema le?
No one would ever do that.	Ame aɖeke mawɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
That’s all there is to it.	Eya koe nye ema.
Everything went well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
But obviously everything fell apart.	Gake edze ƒã be nusianu ge dze anyi.
He didn’t understand why she was there.	Mese nusita wònɔ afima gɔme o.

A good part of it.	Eƒe akpa nyui aɖe.
Promise them whatever you want.	Do nu sia nu si nèdi la ŋugbe na wo.
I knew it would be good.	Menya be anyo.

He has no good news.	Nya nyui aɖeke mele esi o.

I can’t find it either.	Nye hã nyemate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu o.
And that’s life, too.	Eye ema hã nye agbe.

Everything was working great.	Nusianu nɔ dɔ wɔm nyuie ŋutɔ.
This is not a new issue.	Esia menye nya yeye o.

Stay in your hands.	Nɔ wò asi me.
The police hardly arrived.	Kpovitɔwo meva ɖo kura o.
Other than that, there was nothing to it.	Ne menye nenema o la, naneke menɔ eŋu o.

Probably just as well.	Ðewohĩ nenema ke wòle nyuie.
I don’t think it’s possible but it’s a possibility.	Nyemesusu be anya wɔ o gake enye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ.
Always show a happy face.	Ðe mo si me dzidzɔ le fia ɣesiaɣi.

There was a fair share of people there, too.	Amewo ƒe akpa si sɔ nɔ afima, hã.

I definitely need another drink.	Mehiã aha bubu godoo.

The whole city came to a standstill.	Du bliboa va tɔ te.
But he had no heart for it today.	Gake dzi aɖeke menɔ esi ɖe eŋu egbea o.
Very, very difficult.	Sesẽ ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.

Life doesn’t do that either.	Agbe hã mewɔa esia o.
We’re not doing anything like that.	Míele naneke si le abe ema ene wɔm o.
This is more of a problem for me.	Esia nye kuxi nam wu.
At least that first time.	Zi gbãtɔ ma ya teti.
No one could see me there.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu kpɔm le afima o.
Today, no one has a good idea.	Egbea la, susu nyui mele ame aɖeke si o.
I gave him the money.	Metsɔ ga la nɛ.
A lot of time has passed!	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe va yi!
It might still work.	Ðewohĩ awɔ dɔ kokoko.
I know this place well.	Menya teƒe sia nyuie.
There are some good reasons why.	Susu nyui aɖewo li siwo tae.
Book in advance.	Wɔ agbalẽ do ŋgɔ.
That’s your anger talking.	Emae nye wò dziku si le nu ƒom.
I was so busy.	Vovo menɔ ŋunye ale gbegbe.
There is no root anywhere.	Ke aɖeke mele afi aɖeke o.
Something came of it that night.	Nu aɖe do tso eme le zã ma me.
That’s a challenge, but a good one.	Ema nye kuxi, gake enye kuxi nyui aɖe.
In my house.	Le nye aƒeme.
This book is about how to get there.	Agbalẽ sia ku ɖe alesi woawɔ aɖo afima ŋu.
There’s obviously a lot here to work with.	Edze ƒã be nu geɖe le afisia be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
Money is important to me.	Ga le vevie nam.
I needed it in me.	Hiã nɛ le menye.
A condition that can easily last for hours.	Nɔnɔme si ate ŋu anɔ anyi bɔbɔe gaƒoƒo geɖe.
With great respect.	Le bubu gã aɖe me.
It’s just the truth.	Nyateƒea koe wònye.
But today we will do just that.	Gake egbea míawɔ nu ma tututu.
I don't know how can it help.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔe o ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
This is more convenient.	Esia nye nusi sɔ wu.
Consider what that means.	Bu nu si nya ma fia ŋu kpɔ.
Or try to be that way.	Alo dze agbagba be yeanɔ nenema.
He is working hard.	Ele dɔ wɔm sesĩe.
Otherwise, he is doing well.	Ne menye nenema o la, ele edzi dzem nyuie.
But in reality.	Gake le nyateƒe me.
I was convinced this time.	Meka ɖe edzi zi sia.
And in this moment.	Eye le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
We can talk about that.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu tso ema ŋu.
We obviously have some work to do.	Edze ƒã be dɔ aɖewo le mía si míawɔ.
I will continue to do so.	Mayi edzi nenema.
He really didn’t want to go there.	Le nyateƒe me la, medi be yeayi afima o.
I didn’t really know what to say to him.	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
In his hands.	Le eƒe asi me.
He acted like a spoiled child.	Ewɔ nu abe ɖevi si gblẽ ene.
I think he is speaking to everyone.	Mesusu be ele nu ƒom na amesiame.
The result was not satisfactory.	Nusi do tso eme medze ame ŋu o.
He added some salt.	Etsɔ dze aɖe kpe ɖe eŋu.
Before you do that, sign up.	Hafi nàwɔ ema la, ŋlɔ ŋkɔ ɖe eme.
I will say this.	Magblɔ nya sia.
I am sure they are.	Meka ɖe edzi be wole nenema.
From another source.	Tso bubu gbɔ.
But this is still very relevant.	Gake esia gakpɔtɔ sɔ ŋutɔ.
He made a small fire.	Ewɔ dzo sue aɖe.
Win.	Ɖu dzi.
Which suits me perfectly.	Nusi sɔ nam nyuie ŋutɔ.
Get back to life.	Trɔ yi agbe me.
It’s just your kind, you know.	Wò ƒomevi koe wònye, ènya.
Some good things came out this week.	Nu nyui aɖewo do le kwasiɖa sia me.
It seemed to him that it might continue.	Edze nɛ be ɖewohĩ ayi edzi nenema ke.
I have discovered a lot.	Meke ɖe nu geɖe ŋu.
Not me, actually.	Menye nyee o, le nyateƒe me.
Be the one to say sorry.	Nye amesi agblɔ be meɖe kuku.
But nothing came out of my mouth.	Gake naneke medo go le nye nu me o.
It will be very useful.	Aɖe vi ŋutɔ.
He never believed them.	Mexɔ wo dzi se kpɔ o.
But this is also part of his job.	Gake esia hã nye eƒe dɔa ƒe akpa aɖe.
That’s good, too.	Ema hã nyo.
But really, it could be anything.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, ate ŋu anye nusianu.
It will do that.	Awɔe nenema.
It looks good to me.	Edze nam nyuie.
Work only a few hours.	Wɔ dɔ gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
But it was a sick, weird thing.	Gake enye nusi dze dɔ, si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He never does this.	Mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
Nothing in reality.	Naneke mele nyateƒe me o.
These past few years have been tough.	Ƒe ʋɛ siawo siwo va yi la sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I’ve never felt that way before.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o.
I have been working for him for two years.	Ƒe eve enye sia si mele dɔ wɔm nɛ.
It didn’t surprise us.	Mewɔ nuku na mí o.
And the gun, too.	Eye tu la hã.
Quite a few times in fact.	Zi ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ le nyateƒe me.
I can tell you that right now.	Mate ŋu agblɔ nya ma na wò fifia.
It's right there.	Ele afima tututu.
I have them all over the house.	Wo le asinye le aƒea me godoo.
But there was this new house that just looked old.	Gake aƒe yeye sia nɔ anyi si dze abe xoxo ene ko.
These first two things are true.	Nu eve gbãtɔ siawo nye nyateƒe.
He now brought them into book form.	Etsɔ wo va agbalẽ ƒe nɔnɔme me azɔ.
It is a difficult place.	Enye teƒe sesẽ aɖe.
I just can’t do it.	Ðeko nyemate ŋui o.
We are not in a position to give them jobs.	Míele nɔnɔme si me míate ŋu ana dɔ wo la me o.
No one can do it.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋui o.
I can’t do it with him.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe kplii o.
what.	nu ka.
But somehow it doesn’t matter.	Gake le mɔ aɖe nu la, mehiã o.
It happened to everyone.	Edzɔ ɖe amesiame dzi.
There is probably some truth to this.	Anɔ eme be nyateƒe aɖe le esia ŋu.
Any chance for tonight.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ ɖesiaɖe na zã sia.
But these issues can be costly.	Gake nya siawo ate ŋu axɔ ga geɖe.
This has been detrimental to them.	Esia gblẽ nu le wo ŋu.
I have to earn this money.	Ele nam be makpɔ ga sia.
In addition, we can complete it for you.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu la, míate ŋu awu enu na wò.
This is a pretty big deal.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I don’t know where he is.	Nyemenya afi si wòle o.
His house is a simple matter.	Eƒe aƒe nye nya bɔbɔe aɖe.
But it is no longer the case.	Gake megale nenema o.
And, neither is death.	Eye, ku hã mele nenema o.
It would have never occurred to me.	Anye ne mava susu me nam gbeɖe o.
There are only two people.	Ame eve koe li.
Water itself is not far behind.	Tsi ŋutɔ metsi megbe kura o.
That kind of thing.	Nu ma ƒomevi.
What took you so long?	Nukae xɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe na wò?
I'm just not sure exactly what that means.	Ðeko nyemeka ɖe nusi tututu ema fia dzi o.
There is nothing we can do at this point.	Naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
Probably one of the first to do so.	Ðewohĩ ame gbãtɔ siwo wɔ esia la dometɔ ɖeka.
No one knows where you are.	Ame aɖeke menya afi si nèle o.
That he has none.	Be ɖeke mele esi o.
What there will be, will be.	Nusi anɔ anyi, anye.
I was always curious about this.	Medi vevie be manya nu tso nya sia ŋu ɣesiaɣi.
This path was difficult for him.	Mɔ sia dzi wɔwɔ sesẽ nɛ.
He gave them his undivided attention.	Etsɔ eƒe susu si me ma o la na wo.
I do this in a way.	Mewɔa esia le mɔ aɖe nu.
Now take a deep breath.	Azɔ gbɔ ya sesĩe.
Nobody would do that here.	Ame aɖeke mawɔ nu ma le afisia o.
I asked many, many times.	Mebia nya zi geɖe, zi geɖe.
Or under it.	Alo le eƒe te.
It happened a long time ago.	Edzɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
He gave me his name.	Etsɔ eƒe ŋkɔ nam.
It will not go further than that.	Mayi ŋgɔ wu ema o.
If we can get them.	Ne míate ŋu axɔ wo la.
You can’t go anywhere else.	Màte ŋu ayi teƒe bubu aɖeke o.
The dog did the same.	Avu la hã wɔ nenema ke.
He is a teacher.	Enye nufiala.
It can definitely work.	Ate ŋu awɔ dɔ godoo.
I need to talk to you.	Ehiã be maƒo nu na wò.
A little too hard.	Sesẽ vie akpa.
He didn’t get nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe o.
Through rejection, the virtue exists.	To gbegbe me la, nɔnɔme nyui la li.
This didn’t surprise me one bit.	Esia mewɔ nuku nam vie o.
This was not something he could deny.	Esia menye nane si wòate ŋu agbe o.
I didn’t see you there.	Nyemekpɔ wò le afi ma o.
I am realizing this more and more.	Mele esia kpɔm dze sii geɖe wu.
This is not a good job.	Esia menye dɔ nyui aɖeke o.
I had a lot of fun with this.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ geɖe le esia ŋu.
The wind itself seemed to be blowing in our faces.	Edze abe ya ŋutɔ nɔ míaƒe mo ƒom ene.
This seems inefficient.	Esia dze abe ɖe mewɔa dɔ nyuie o ene.
It’s just as important.	Ðeko wòle vevie nenema ke.
This time it was done by one man.	Fifia ya, ŋutsu ɖeka aɖee wɔe.
Please, man.	Taflatse, ame.
It was a machine.	Mɔ̃ aɖee wònye.
I need to find a new job.	Ele be madi dɔ yeye aɖe.
But nothing worked.	Gake naneke mewɔ dɔ o.
Surprisingly, he didn’t seem to know who she was.	Ewɔ nuku be edze abe menya amesi wònye o ene.
I actually do this.	Mewɔa esia ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It is as important as any other.	Ele vevie abe bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
Not for something this important.	Menye ɖe nane si le vevie alea ta o.
People still talk about that now.	Amewo gakpɔtɔ ƒoa nu tso nya ma ŋu fifia.
We had that mentality.	Susu ma nɔ mía si.
This is just another issue.	Nya bubu aɖe koe nye esia.
I went out there.	Medo go yi afima.
There was a smoke going on.	Dzudzɔ aɖe nɔ edzi yim.
That’s obviously too small.	Edze ƒã be ema le sue akpa.
It’s new to me.	Enye yeye nam.
Each house had four simple rooms.	Xɔ bɔbɔe ene nɔ aƒe ɖesiaɖe me.
Still, it stays nice.	Ke hã, eƒe nu nɔa anyi nyuie.
His point remains true.	Eƒe nya la gakpɔtɔ nye nyateƒe.
Just the thing.	Nu la koe.
He will do anything.	Awɔ nusianu.
Yet it can be a crowded place.	Ke hã ate ŋu anye teƒe si amewo sɔ gbɔ ɖo.
He can help with it.	Ate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu.
It is something real.	Enye nane ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That much is right.	Nu geɖe ma sɔ.
I got along well with him.	Mewɔ ɖeka kplii nyuie.
But this is not expensive.	Gake esia mexɔ asi o.
We can’t stay here.	Míate ŋu anɔ afisia o.
Water is very expensive.	Tsi xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Or there can be none.	Alo ɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
This is not a difficult problem.	Esia menye kuxi sesẽ aɖeke o.
Something is terribly wrong.	Nane gblẽ vevie ŋutɔ.
You are doing very well.	Èle edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔ.
It’s clever.	Edze aɖaŋu.
But we’re not ready for that right now.	Gake míele klalo na ema fifia o.
This is a huge problem.	Esia nye kuxi gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
That’s enough.	Ema sɔ gbɔ.
Without space there would be nothing.	Teƒe manɔmee la, nu aɖeke manɔ anyi o.
But there was nothing between us, of course.	Gake naneke menɔ mía dome o ya.
I couldn’t figure out how to do this.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ alesi mawɔ esia o.
Focus on that task, nothing else.	Lé fɔ ɖe dɔ ma ŋu, ke menye nu bubu aɖeke o.
You can help yourself, too.	Àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò hã.
I remembered something very suddenly.	Meɖo ŋku nane dzi zi ɖeka ŋutɔ.
I think that’s enough.	Mesusu be ema sɔ gbɔ.
I'll see you in two days.	Makpɔ wò le ŋkeke eve megbe.
But at this point, it is what it is.	Gake le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, enye nusi wònye.
We have so much time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe ŋutɔ le mía si.
I don’t want anything.	Nyemedi naneke o.
You finally had everything you ever wanted.	Nusianu si nèdi kpɔ la va nɔ asiwò mlɔeba.
He had something.	Nane nɔ esi.
That’s the only thing that’s depressing.	Ema koe nye nu si te ɖe ame dzi.
And that worked.	Eye ema wɔ dɔ.
On this point, he certainly will.	Le nya sia ŋu la, awɔe godoo.
I was never alone.	Nye ɖeka koe menye gbeɖe o.
He would never have let go.	Anye ne maɖe asi le eŋu gbeɖe o.
That’s definitely a trend.	Ema nye nɔnɔme aɖe godoo.
There was only one road.	Mɔ ɖeka koe nɔ afima.
I got something.	Mexɔ nane.
In your mind, talk to him.	Le wò susu me la, ƒo nu kplii.
You can never do it.	Màte ŋu awɔe gbeɖe o.
He has two projects in mind today.	Dɔ eve le susu me nɛ be wòawɔ egbea.
Or he had something.	Alo nane nɔ esi.
And that’s about it.	Eye nya ma ku ɖe eŋu.
Finally, something shot.	Mlɔeba la, nane tu.
Everyone just kept having fun.	Ðeko amesiame yi edzi nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm.
I am not the rock.	Menye nyee nye kpe la o.
You might get a smoke or two.	Àte ŋu akpɔ dzudzɔ ɖeka alo eve.
But there is something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã li.
He worked hard for many years.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe ƒe geɖe.
You definitely have a point there.	Nya aɖe le asiwò le afima godoo.
We cannot know what will happen.	Míate ŋu anya nusi ava dzɔ o.
I do the same thing.	Nye hã mewɔa nenema ke.
I would be the same.	Nye hã manɔ nenema.
Its not the same thing.	Eƒe menye nu ɖeka o.
This sounds like a good deal.	Esia ɖi nya nyui aɖe.
Just one word one please.	Nya ɖeka koe ame ɖeka taflatse.
Very simple for the reason.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ na susu si tae.
There must have been at least two of them.	Wo dometɔ eve ya teti anya nɔ anyi.
This book just captured my imagination.	Ðeko agbalẽ sia lé nye susu.
But you can’t do it.	Gake màte ŋui o.
I couldn’t help myself.	Nyemete ŋu kpe ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o.
I have nothing in my life.	Naneke mele asinye le nye agbe me o.
Or maybe you need to do the opposite.	Alo ɖewohĩ ahiã be nàwɔ nusi to vovo na ema.
And for four people.	Eye na ame ene.
There seems to be no truth to it.	Edze abe nyateƒe aɖeke mele eme o ene.
This was a shock to me.	Nu sia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
But this looks really good.	Gake esia dze nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There may be a little truth in that.	Nyateƒe vi aɖe ate ŋu anɔ nya ma me.
This situation makes sense.	Susu le nɔnɔme sia me.
We’re going to beat you.	Míele wò ƒo ge.
This would be another detrimental factor.	Esia anye nu bubu si ana nu gblẽ le ame ŋu.
Consider the consequences.	Bu nusi ado tso eme ŋu kpɔ.
This is like nowhere else.	Esia mele abe teƒe bubu aɖeke ene o.
But our	Gake míaƒe .
You know that this is true.	Ènya be nya sia nye nyateƒe.
He didn’t have money either.	Ga hã menɔ esi o.
No one was running towards them now.	Ame aɖeke menɔ du dzi ɖo ta wo gbɔ fifia o.
I know exactly what went into it.	Menya nusi tututu ge ɖe eme.
What a waste of water.	Tsi gbegblẽ kae nye si.
He should be able to surprise himself.	Ele be wòate ŋu awɔ nuku na eɖokui.
This used to work well.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie tsã.
There is simply no way.	Ðeko mɔ aɖeke meli o.
No mistake, nothing.	Vodada aɖeke meli o, naneke meli o.
Look for this.	Di nu si.
I want to see the whole thing.	Medi be makpɔ nu bliboa.
This sounds more complicated than it is.	Esia ɖi nya sesẽ wu alesi wòle.
This is very simple and inexpensive.	Esia le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ eye mexɔ asi o.
Maybe it’s as simple as that.	Ðewohĩ ele bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
Ema will go.	Ema ava yi.
But the opposite happened.	Gake nusi to vovo kura na esia dzɔ.
It’s a great thing, really.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
Life is too short.	Agbe le kpuie akpa.
He was now seriously ill.	Edze dɔ vevie azɔ.
Until the night.	Vaseɖe zã me.
Much more, too.	Nu geɖe wu hã.
It could be your last mistake.	Ate ŋu anye vodada mamlɛtɔ si nèwɔ.
I want you to have a copy.	Medi be eƒe ɖe nanɔ asiwò.
It can be overwhelming.	Ate ŋu anye nusi gbɔ eme.
I was hoping it wasn’t me.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be menye nyee o.
It is also the truth.	Azɔ hã enye nyateƒea.
That just disappeared.	Ðeko ema bu.
And maybe it’s because of you.	Eye ɖewohĩ wò tae.
It seems simple enough.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe ale gbegbe ene.
What do you do?	Dɔ ka wɔm nèle?
No one is in charge of the project.	Ame aɖeke mele dɔa dzi kpɔm o.
New, monthly or so.	Yeye, ɣleti sia ɣleti alo esi wu nenema.
But that didn’t help either.	Gake ema hã meɖe vi aɖeke o.
This is just too much.	Ðeko esia sɔ gbɔ akpa.
Everyone does it, often.	Amesiame wɔa esia, zi geɖe.
Just a weird little thought came into my head.	Susu sue aɖe si mewɔ nuku o koe va nye ta me.
He never would have been able to achieve this.	Anye ne mate ŋu aɖo esia gbɔ gbeɖe o.
He needed life.	Ehiã agbe.
My subconscious was already working hard.	Nye susu te nɔ dɔ wɔm vevie xoxo.
There is nothing to do.	Naneke meli woawɔ o.
Do you know where this was?	Ènya afisi esia nɔ?
He couldn’t find it.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
That’s hard in itself.	Ema sesẽ le eɖokui si.
I put water in your room.	Metsɔ tsi de wò xɔ me.
Some of us did that.	Mía dometɔ aɖewo wɔe nenema.
He had a bad attitude.	Nɔnɔme gbegblẽ aɖe nɔ esi.
I know people who want that.	Menya ame siwo di nenema.
That’s what I’m thinking.	Emae nye nye susu.
He had a word for everyone.	Nya aɖe nɔ esi na amesiame.
Can anyone please help???.	Ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò taflatse???.
He probably won’t be active this long either.	Anɔ eme be manɔ dɔ dzi ɣeyiɣi didi sia hã o.
So far she is doing really well.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ele edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It will never work.	Mawɔ dɔ gbeɖe o.
None of these things are true.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
He can explain it, himself.	Ate ŋu aɖe eme, eya ŋutɔ.
I don’t know if that’s still true or not.	Menya nenye be nya ma gakpɔtɔ nye nyateƒe loo alo menye nyateƒe o.
There was no one in his room.	Ame aɖeke menɔ eƒe xɔa me o.
Just not right now.	Ðeko menye fifia o.
His face came alive.	Eƒe mo va nɔ agbe.
If it wasn’t for him, he wouldn’t have made it.	Ne menye eya tae o la, anye ne mate ŋu aɖo afima o.
From.	Tso.
He couldn’t leave twice.	Mete ŋu dzo zi eve o.
This dish is easy to make.	Nuɖuɖu sia wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe.
A very different place.	Teƒe bubu aɖe ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t get enough of it.	Mete ŋu kpɔ eƒe nu sɔ gbɔ o.
No real reason in my head.	Susu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke mele nye ta me o.
Please, save me.	Meɖe kuku, ɖem.
But it’s not the same.	Gake menye ɖekae o.
But he has at least four of us.	Gake mí ame ene ya teti le esi.
There is a town near here.	Du aɖe le afi sia gbɔ.
I’m not doing anything and you’re not doing anything.	Nyemele naneke wɔm o eye wò hã mèle naneke wɔm o.
It would have been much easier.	Anye ne anɔ bɔbɔe wu kura hafi.
All these months.	Ɣleti siawo katã.
We will make this assumption.	Míawɔ susu sia.
Now turn around.	Azɔ trɔ ɖe megbe.
This was a wonderful day.	Esia nye ŋkeke nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
This phase lasts four weeks.	Akpa sia xɔa kwasiɖa ene.
Maybe a long time ago.	Ðewohĩ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
In fact, it’s amazing.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
We are doing this work together.	Míele dɔ sia wɔm ɖekae.
This takes more time.	Esia xɔa ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu.
No one wants to witness this.	Ame aɖeke medi be yeakpɔ esia teƒe o.
I walked out of my room and saw you.	Medo go le nye xɔ me eye mekpɔ wò.
Not much, really.	Menye nu geɖe o, le nyateƒe me.
But yesterday is all that really matters.	Gake etsɔ koe nye nusi le vevie ŋutɔ.
Many of them do this.	Wo dometɔ geɖe wɔa esia.
Finding a job was not easy.	Dɔ didi menɔ bɔbɔe o.
It’s about everything.	Enye nusi ku ɖe nusianu ŋu.
There should be only one rule.	Ele be se ɖeka koe nanɔ anyi.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Stay with them.	Nɔ wo gbɔ.
I needed to make some calls.	Ehiã be maƒo ka na ame aɖewo.
I want to do exactly what is there.	Medi be mawɔ nu si tututu le afima.
But that is behind us.	Gake ema le megbe na mí.
He had a life.	Agbe aɖe nɔ esi.
Something that resonated with me.	Nane si ɖi ɖe dzinye.
I breezed through it.	Metsɔ ya ƒo to eme.
It’s important, too!	Ele vevie hã!
A machine, perhaps.	Mɔ̃ aɖe, ɖewohĩ.
He had no money.	Ga aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
That is a very appropriate statement.	Nya ma nye nya si sɔ ŋutɔ.
This is true in many ways.	Esia nye nyateƒe le mɔ geɖe nu.
Medi ga.	Medi ga.
You just went there.	Wò koe yi afima.
Yet this seems pretty close to that.	Ke hã edze abe esia te ɖe ema ŋu kura ene.
No one has tried it.	Ame aɖeke mete kpɔ o.
From our past.	Tso míaƒe ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me.
He just can’t stand it.	Ðeko mete ŋu nɔa te ɖe enu o.
A small cottage by a lake.	Aƒe sue aɖe si le ta aɖe to.
I glanced back.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe megbe.
I don’t know which one.	Nyemenya wo dometɔ kae o.
I am not like you.	Nyemele abe wò ene o.
He couldn't tell where he was.	Mete ŋu nya afi si wòle o.
In this case, the.	Le go sia me la.
I don't understand.	Nye mese egɔme o.
That’s too small.	Ema le sue akpa.
A few new techniques seem to be doing some good.	Edze abe aɖaŋu yeye ʋɛ aɖewo le nu nyui aɖewo wɔm ene.
I can’t quite explain it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eme tututu o.
But there is some good news in there somewhere.	Gake nya nyui aɖewo le afima le afi aɖe.
Not nearly enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ kloe o.
But.	Gake.
He would never do that.	Mawɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
The work is going well.	Dɔa le edzi yim nyuie.
It’s a really bad idea.	Enye susu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Come if you can.	Va ne àte ŋui.
So far everything works.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nusianu wɔa dɔ.
He collapsed in his car.	Edze anyi le eƒe ʋua me.
So far it’s pretty easy.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t see them.	Mete ŋu kpɔ wo o.
They all had their own.	Wo katã wo tɔ nɔ wo si.
I was so close to me.	Mete ɖe ŋunye ale gbegbe.
Tell me what you are doing today.	Gblɔ nusi wɔm nèle egbea nam.
I decided to deal with that now.	Meɖoe be makpɔ ema gbɔ fifia.
And it often is.	Eye zi geɖe la, ele nenema.
Not so today.	Menye nenema egbea o.
And his life, too.	Eye eƒe agbe hã.
His anger was obvious.	Eƒe dziku la dze ƒã.
No one here has ever seen a car.	Ame aɖeke mele afisia kpɔ ʋu kpɔ o.
Just like you are.	Abe ale si ko nèle ene.
We know each other very well.	Míenya mía nɔewo nyuie ŋutɔ.
You can do this a few hours in advance, of course.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo do ŋgɔ ya.
They are all important.	Wo katã le vevie.
We can go somewhere else.	Míate ŋu ayi teƒe bubu.
In a month’s time.	Le ɣleti ɖeka me.
In this way, people will eventually see the truth.	To mɔ sia dzi la, amewo ava kpɔ nyateƒea mlɔeba.
It’s much easier now.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ fifia.
Pray, eat, talk.	Do gbe ɖa, ɖu nu, ɖo dze.
I’m glad I got here.	Edzɔ dzi nam be meva ɖo afisia.
He liked the idea of ​​that.	Ema ƒe susu dze eŋu.
Or it may be so.	Alo ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
In fact, it’s quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo kura.
If anyone can help that would be great.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu la, anyo ŋutɔ.
Decide what you want.	Tso nya me le nusi dim nèle ŋu.
But it never came up.	Gake meva do gbeɖe o.
Who is this guy?	Amekae nye ame sia?
And, of course, it still doesn’t.	Eye, le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema kokoko o.
I just have time to talk about this.	Ðeko ɣeyiɣi le asinye maƒo nu tso nya sia ŋu.
It is within reach now.	Ele afisi wòate ŋu aɖo fifia.
It was such a great thing.	Enye nu gã ma gbegbe.
From the home.	Tso aƒeme.
I would like to try.	Madi be mate kpɔ.
Today everyone does that.	Egbea amesiame wɔa nu ma.
Turn around to me.	Trɔ ɖe ŋunye.
This was too much for him.	Esia sɔ gbɔ akpa nɛ.
But there’s not much left in his head.	Gake nu geɖe megale eƒe ta me o.
Lots of stuff like that.	Nu geɖe siwo le abe ema ene.
He would have loved to be here today.	Anye ne adzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ be yeanɔ afisia egbea hafi.
But that is correct.	Gake nya ma sɔ.
But this is even more important today.	Gake esia le vevie wu egbea.
Another mistake occurred.	Vodada bubu aɖe hã dzɔ.
I wondered what was going on.	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae nɔ edzi yim hã.
It will be a great loss for them.	Anye nu gã aɖe si bu na wo.
But there was no time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
He would never do it.	Mawɔe gbeɖe o.
And now that’s enough.	Eye fifia ema sɔ gbɔ.
Ask this simple question.	Bia nya bɔbɔe sia.
This certainly wasn’t going according to plan.	Esia menɔ edzi yim le ɖoɖo nu o godoo.
That took much longer.	Ema xɔ ɣeyiɣi didi wu kura.
Some of these things are difficult.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖewo sesẽ.
Someone had mentioned his name.	Ame aɖe gblɔ eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ.
The surprise, really, is that it would have worked.	Nusi wɔ nuku, le nyateƒe me, enye be anye ne awɔ dɔ hafi.
It wasn’t something he enjoyed.	Menye nusi doa dzidzɔ nɛ ye wònye o.
He is just beginning to find his way.	Ðeko wòle eƒe mɔ didi gɔme teti koe nye ema.
What is that.	Nukae nye ema.
Everything is gone.	Nusianu nu yi.
As if we don’t know what year this is.	Abe ɖe míenya ƒe si me esia nye o ene.
It wouldn’t surprise me.	Mawɔ nuku nam o.
You have everything.	Nusianu le asiwò.
And they all seem to be enjoying themselves.	Eye edze abe wo katã wole dzidzɔ kpɔm ene.
It didn’t work, nothing worked.	Mewɔ dɔ o, naneke mewɔ dɔ o.
This is definitely a bad idea.	Esia nye susu gbegblẽ aɖe godoo.
It was a surprise to him.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
Your name is.	Wò ŋkɔ.
Everyone was very excited.	Dzi dzɔ amesiame ŋutɔ.
That time was not like today.	Ɣeyiɣi ma menɔ abe egbea ene o.
I walked out of the room.	Medo go le xɔa me.
Everyone talked about it.	Amesiame ƒo nu tso eŋu.
It will need more money.	Ahiã ga geɖe wu.
Meet me tonight.	Do go nam le zã sia me.
He could hardly bear to be in the room.	Mete ŋu do dzi kura be yeanɔ xɔa me o.
The city that was once home, but no longer.	Du si nye aƒe tsã, gake megale afima o.
I heard your voice.	Mese wò gbe.
Today is different.	Egbea ya to vovo.
Your man is back there.	Wò ame le megbe afima.
I can’t travel with you today.	Nyemate ŋu azɔ mɔ kpli wò egbea o.
He will travel with you.	Azɔ mɔ kple wò.
Thank you, anyway.	Akpe na wò, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I just really want to keep doing my job.	Ðeko medi vevie be mayi dzi awɔ nye dɔ.
I’ve seen them before.	Mekpɔ wo kpɔ.
I was so nervous, so tired.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ale gbegbe, ɖeɖi te ŋunye ale gbegbe.
Eventually, he will do more.	Mlɔeba la, awɔ nu geɖe wu ema.
Again, not true at all.	Le afisia hã la, menye nyateƒe kura o.
Let me tell you something else.	Mina magblɔ nya bubu aɖe na mi.
I wonder what will happen now.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae adzɔ fifia hã.
Consider the opposite.	Bu nusi to vovo na ema ŋu kpɔ.
It will be like that.	Anɔ nenema.
Now we have two new models.	Fifia mɔ̃ yeye eve le mía si.
I was too late.	Metsi megbe akpa.
You have the right reasons.	Susu siwo sɔ la le asiwò.
But it will be here soon.	Gake ava afisia kpuie.
I’m not quite sure.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi tututu o.
There is no place like home.	Teƒe aɖeke meli abe aƒe ene o.
He won’t talk to me.	Maƒo nu nam o.
But it’s just underwater.	Gake tsi te koe wòle.
Finished very quickly.	Wu enu kaba ŋutɔ.
Its your own opinion that they are right.	Eƒe wò ŋutɔ wò susu be wole eteƒe.
But it is there.	Gake ele afima.
That will take care of it.	Emae akpɔ edzi.
But it’s like doing anything.	Gake ele abe nusianu wɔwɔ ene.
And there is a problem.	Eye kuxi aɖe hã li.
I need another shot.	Mehiã tu bubu.
However, there are issues here.	Ke hã, nya aɖewo le afisia.
Longer than me.	Didi wu nye.
Everyone is confident.	Amesiame ka ɖe eɖokui dzi.
What is the right thing to do?	Nukae wòle be nàwɔ?
You can just go out and do your job.	Àte ŋu ado go awɔ wò dɔ ko.
But it couldn’t have been easy.	Gake mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe hafi o.
They have to act at once.	Ele be woawɔ nu zi ɖeka.
And we didn’t have that time.	Eye ɣeyiɣi ma menɔ mía si o.
He said nothing in reply.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke tsɔ ɖo eŋu nɛ o.
He definitely took his time getting up here.	Etsɔ eƒe ɣeyiɣi fɔ ɖe afisia godoo.
This is going to be a big deal, man.	Esia ava nye nya gã aɖe, ŋutsu.
Another person died.	Ame bubu aɖe hã ku.
That was very bad.	Ema gblẽ nu ŋutɔ.
There was a crowd of people.	Amewo ƒo zi ɖe afima.
On the other hand, he liked her.	Le go bubu me la, eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
The dress is too short.	Awu la le kpuie akpa.
And another one, too.	Eye bubu hã.
This is not exactly true.	Esia menye nyateƒe tututu o.
Day is only one aspect.	Ŋkeke nye akpa ɖeka ko.
He wouldn’t have been there.	Anye ne manɔ afima o.
It was a good day for him.	Enye ŋkeke nyui aɖe nɛ.
This should be done here as well.	Ele be woawɔ esia le afisia hã.
And everywhere else.	Eye le teƒe bubu ɖesiaɖe hã.
And of course I have to.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ele nam.
Nothing against it at all.	Naneke metsi tre ɖe eŋu kura o.
Not really a surprise.	Menye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
We have a lot to do in the morning.	Nu geɖe li míawɔ le ŋdi me.
He was very interested.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme ŋutɔ.
Same kind of reason.	Susu ma ke ƒomevi.
I can hardly say I understand it myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mate ŋu agblɔ kura be mese egɔme o.
He couldn't make any sense of it.	Susu aɖeke mete ŋu le eŋu o.
I wondered what he could remember in it.	Mebia ɖokuinye be nu kae wòate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi le eme hã.
How do you know if you’re happy?	Aleke nàwɔ anya ne èle dzidzɔ kpɔm?
Why, he doesn’t know.	Nukatae, menya o.
What! 	Nu ka!
They were so discouraged.	Dzi ɖe le wo ƒo ale gbegbe.
The same is true here.	Nenema ke wòle le afisia hã.
It seemed like a good thing for him.	Edze abe nu nyui aɖee wònye nɛ ene.
He didn't care what happened to either of us.	Metsɔ ɖeke le nusi dzɔ ɖe mía dometɔ aɖeke dzi me kura o.
This guy can do it.	Ŋutsu sia ate ŋui.
This is a difficult but necessary task.	Esia nye dɔ sesẽ aɖe gake ehiã.
It was really a good thing for me.	Enye nu nyui aɖe nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But it can be really useful.	Gake ate ŋu aɖe vi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Very rarely would he do something so personal for her.	Ƒã ŋutɔ hafi wòawɔ nane si nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ nenema gbegbe nɛ.
This is very important.	Esia le vevie ŋutɔ.
By doing the opposite of what you want.	To nusi to vovo na nusi dim nèle la wɔwɔ me.
His expressionless face.	Eƒe mo si meɖe naneke fia o.
I would love to meet with you.	Adzɔ dzi nam be mado go kpli wò.
It worked.	Ewɔ dɔ.
Closer to it.	Te ɖe eŋu wu.
I'm kind of fucking at home there.	Mele aƒeme ƒomevi aɖe le fu ɖem le afima.
The market is just too small.	Ðeko asi la le sue akpa.
We can find them.	Míate ŋu ake ɖe wo ŋu.
It’s been there for a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia wòle afima.
If this, do so.	Ne esia la, ke wɔe nenema.
But it’s not that simple.	Gake menye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
That it all turned this way.	Be wo katã trɔ ɖe mɔ sia nu.
He had a good eye, too.	Ŋku nyui aɖe nɔ esi, eya hã.
I had never heard of it.	Nyemese eŋu nya kpɔ o.
But he did the opposite.	Gake ewɔ nusi to vovo na ema.
You can’t do that now.	Màte ŋu awɔ ema fifia o.
A good part of it.	Akpa nyui aɖe.
Interesting stuff too.	Nu siwo doa dzidzɔ na ame hã.
Is that what it is.	Ðe emae nye nu si.
The lake is near here.	Ta la te ɖe afisia ŋu.
It wasn’t too hot.	Mexɔ dzo akpa o.
However, things are not that simple.	Ke hã, nuwo mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
I tried, believe me.	Medze agbagba, xɔ dzinye se.
Everyone seemed to be waiting for this.	Edze abe amesiame nɔ esia lalam ene.
Or someone else.	Alo ame bubu aɖe.
Truer to life.	Nyateƒe wu le agbe me.
It’s just wrong.	Ðeko wònye nu gbegblẽ.
Everything is gone.	Nusianu nu yi.
What a great idea.	Susu gã kae nye si.
Just like the past two years.	Abe alesi wònɔ le ƒe eve siwo va yi me ene.
This thought hit him in the police car.	Susu sia ƒo ɖe eŋu le kpovitɔwo ƒe ʋua me.
That really means a lot to me.	Ema fia nu geɖe nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This in itself is not such a big deal.	Esia ŋutɔ menye nya gã aɖeke nenema gbegbe o.
That man is not in that room.	Ŋutsu ma mele xɔ ma me o.
Near his neck.	Le eƒe kɔ gbɔ.
Or, you can go ahead and do it.	Alo, àte ŋu ayi edzi awɔe.
There was still something to be done.	Nane gakpɔtɔ nɔ anyi si wòle be woawɔ.
I’ve never seen you before.	Nyemekpɔ wò kpɔ o.
Lots and lots of reasons.	Susu geɖe kple geɖe.
I don't really know what your point might be though.	Nyemenya nusi tututu wò nya la ate ŋu anye o ke hã.
I thought something was wrong with me.	Mesusu be nane gblẽ le ŋunye.
Something about the shape of your face.	Nane si ku ɖe wò mo ƒe nɔnɔme ŋu.
I have seen you many times.	Mekpɔ wò zi geɖe.
And he doesn’t deserve it.	Eye medze nɛ o.
I actually enjoyed it a lot.	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
We can win the battle.	Míate ŋu aɖu dzi.
Some people are happy.	Ame aɖewo kpɔa dzidzɔ.
He’s really well-intentioned.	Eƒe susu nyui le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We are just looking for a name.	Ŋkɔ aɖe koe míele dim.
I’m not going to talk to you about it.	Nyemele nu ƒom na wò tso eŋu o.
Something is wrong.	Nane gblẽ.
But no one believed that.	Gake ame aɖeke mexɔ nya ma dzi se o.
He didn't really know what he was expecting.	Menya nusi tututu wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na o.
There was no way out for me.	Mɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi nam be mado le eme o.
That is the result.	Emae nye nusi ado tso eme.
I think it would have helped us.	Mesusu be akpe ɖe mía ŋu hafi.
It will arrive in the next few days.	Ava ɖo le ŋkeke ʋɛ siwo gbɔna me.
He wasn't sure what to do now.	Meka ɖe nusi wòawɔ fifia dzi o.
The spill is still fresh in people’s minds.	Nusi kɔ ɖe eme la gakpɔtɔ nye nu yeye le amewo ƒe susu me.
He had no desires of his own.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe didi aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
But the work is still about.	Gake dɔa gakpɔtɔ le nu ƒom tso eŋu.
Its about the mind.	Eƒe ku ɖe susu ŋu.
Or anyone else.	Alo ame sia ame.
But, we have to do our part.	Gake, ele be míawɔ míaƒe akpa dzi.
You have my word.	Nye nya le asiwò.
That is not a good news.	Menye nya nyuie wònye o.
All of them, for now.	Wo katã, fifia ya.
He never borrowed any money.	Medo ga aɖeke kpɔ o.
But he was very surprised.	Gake ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
He too lost a lot.	Eya hã bu nu geɖe.
The issue is very difficult.	Nya la sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Tell me what you want.	Gblɔ nusi dim nèle nam.
You can’t escape this.	Màte ŋu asi le esia nu o.
Not at all today.	Menye nenema kura egbea o.
But he never came.	Gake meva kpɔ o.
Not with these people.	Menye kple ame siawo o.
We can’t understand each other.	Míate ŋu ase mía nɔewo gɔme o.
But it may not be the case.	Gake ɖewohĩ manɔ nenema o.
I will take care of this.	Makpɔ esia gbɔ.
There are some things you don’t know.	Nu aɖewo li siwo mènya o.
That in itself is interesting.	Ema ŋutɔ doa dzidzɔ na ame.
Think about it for once.	Bu eŋu kpɔ zi ɖeka.
In his own way.	Le eya ŋutɔ ƒe mɔ nu.
I can actually talk to you.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu kpli wò ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s important to me.	Ele vevie nam.
I can see one reason here for that possibility.	Mete ŋu kpɔ susu ɖeka le afisia si tae wòate ŋu adzɔ nenema ɖo.
Someone pretending to be someone else.	Ame aɖe si le eɖokui wɔm abe ame bubu ene.
But I would like to say one thing.	Gake madi be magblɔ nya ɖeka.
Someone is behind him.	Ame aɖe le megbe nɛ.
He put his hand over his heart.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ɖo eƒe dzi dzi.
There is no issue.	Nya aɖeke meli o.
I can handle this, it’s just a project.	Mate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ, dɔ aɖe koe wònye.
No one is like that, including me.	Ame aɖeke mele nenema o, nye hã mele eme o.
That’s right.	Ema sɔ.
This is a serious mistake.	Esia nye vodada gã aɖe.
I tried to get things done.	Medze agbagba be mawɔ nuwo.
That used to suit me.	Ema sɔ nam tsã.
We can find it.	Míate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu.
It doesn’t matter.	Mehiã o.
The money is definitely in it.	Ga la le eme godoo.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I just thought it would be nice to see you.	Ðeko mesusu be anyo be makpɔ wò.
But there are still a few about.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ li ku ɖe.
It’s a very bad thing.	Enye nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔ.
And it’s not just an idea.	Eye menye susu aɖe ko o.
I could live with that for a very long time.	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe ɖe ema nu ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
The teacher was furious.	Nufiala la do dziku vevie.
I really don’t know any better.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi nyo wu o.
Ya la ku.	Ya la ku.
Which surprised me a lot.	Nusi wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
He doesn’t ask questions about it.	Mebiaa nya tso eŋu o.
We are missing something.	Míele nane tom.
Maybe no one else knows.	Ðewohĩ ame bubu aɖeke menya o.
At least a few hours.	Gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo ya teti.
That has already happened.	Ema dzɔ xoxo.
And maybe that’s just as well.	Eye ɖewohĩ ema hã nyo nenema ke.
It is something one can or cannot do.	Enye nusi ame ate ŋu awɔ alo mate ŋu awɔ o.
But I did it for all the good it did for me.	Gake mewɔe le nyui siwo katã wòwɔ nam la ta.
It’s a good thing he didn’t.	Enye nu nyui aɖe si mewɔe o.
And that’s really, that’s very important.	Eye ema le vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ, ema le vevie ŋutɔ.
I don’t think there’s anything more we can do.	Nyemesusu be naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ wu ema o.
Stay in your room.	Nɔ wò xɔ me.
I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t do something in that way.	Nyemekpɔ susu aɖeke si tae mele be nàwɔ nane le mɔ ma nu o.
He didn’t think it would work.	Mesusu be awɔ dɔ o.
I'm sure it will work very well.	Meka ɖe edzi be awɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
We will arrange a time and place for that.	Míawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe aɖe ŋu na ema.
I can’t have this in my house.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia le nye aƒe me o.
Yet that doesn’t matter.	Ke hã ema mehiã o.
It’s totally normal.	Enye nusi sɔ kura.
For at least a month.	Ɣleti ɖeka ya teti.
Whatever you like.	Nusianu si dze ŋuwò.
You know better than that.	Ènya nu nyuie wu ema.
Until he didn’t.	Vaseɖe esime mewɔe nenema o.
They will fight.	Woawɔ avu.
I hope everyone gets what they want.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be amesiame akpɔ nusi dim wòle.
But she didn’t believe him, not really.	Gake mexɔ edzi se o, menye le nyateƒe me o.
He was passionate about it all.	Dzo nɔ eme ɖe wo katã ŋu.
I know you can’t talk about it.	Menya be màte ŋu aƒo nu tso eŋu o.
This is of course, not true.	Esia nye nyateƒe ya, menye nyateƒe o.
And yet of course it’s also weird.	Eye ke hã le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ nuku hã.
I’m just not there yet.	Ðeko nyemele afima haɖe o.
In that room.	Le xɔ ma me.
I have nothing or no one to live up to.	Naneke alo ame aɖeke mele asinye manɔ agbe ɖe enu o.
And another a week later.	Eye bubu le kwasiɖa ɖeka megbe.
I have to go to the gym.	Ele be mayi.
I gave two thousand.	Metsɔ akpe eve na.
I am not here for sensationalism.	Menye nya siwo doa dzidzɔ na ame tae mele afisia ɖo o.
And yet, he was surprised.	Eye ke hã, ewɔ nuku nɛ.
He wouldn’t know where he was.	Manya afisi wòle o.
Some people died.	Ame aɖewo ku.
That is probably the most likely outcome.	Anɔ eme be emae nye nusi ate ŋu ado tso eme wu.
He didn’t know who he was.	Menya amesi wònye o.
It obviously doesn’t need much.	Edze ƒã be mehiã nu geɖe o.
He has his man.	Eƒe ame le esi.
Something of a skill, now.	Aɖaŋu ƒe nu aɖe, fifia.
I would be very happy.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I really like them.	Wo dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
He was the only one there.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ afima.
And what they’re in now.	Eye nusi me wole fifia.
In fact, he wouldn’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, mawɔe nenema o.
It may be that	Ate ŋu anye ne .
His bloody leg.	Eƒe afɔ si me ʋu le la.
He wasn’t supposed to do this.	Menye ɖe wòle be wòawɔ esia o.
So there are familiar problems.	Eya ta, kuxi siwo ame geɖe nya la li.
His own voice.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe gbe.
He spent the whole afternoon in the water.	Etsɔ ŋdɔ bliboa katã yi tsi me.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Or didn’t, until last night.	Alo mewɔe o, vaseɖe zã si va yi me.
On my current system this takes about an hour.	Le nye ɖoɖo si li fifia dzi la, esia xɔa abe gaƒoƒo ɖeka ene.
This can’t go anywhere.	Esia mate ŋu ayi afi aɖeke o.
There was nothing there against him.	Naneke menɔ afima si tsi tre ɖe eŋu o.
We now know that we can.	Míenya azɔ be míate ŋui.
He did this as quickly as the first.	Ewɔ esia kaba abe gbãtɔ ene.
I could never do that.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma gbeɖe o.
However, things have changed in recent years.	Ke hã, nuwo trɔ le ƒe ʋɛ siwo va yi me.
Help me out here, people!.	Kpe ɖe ŋunye le afisia, amewo!.
Perhaps you are struggling now.	Ðewohĩ èle agbagba dzem fifia.
I don’t know what time it is.	Nyemenya ɣeyiɣi si me wòle o.
In and of itself, that’s not really a problem.	Le eɖokui si la, ema menye kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He is a child of the law.	Enye se la ƒe vi.
There is no work to be done.	Dɔ aɖeke meli woawɔ o.
If nothing, everything is available.	Ne naneke meli o la, ke nusianu li woawɔ.
But after that, things got better.	Gake le ema megbe la, nuwo va nyo ɖe edzi.
Come and join us.	Va kpe ɖe mía ŋu.
Go somewhere else.	Yi teƒe bubu aɖe.
It is a very difficult reality.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si sesẽ ŋutɔ.
For everything really.	Le nusianu ta ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I was sure something had gone wrong.	Meka ɖe edzi be nane gblẽ kpɔ.
That's right.	Ema nyo ya.
Think about tomorrow.	Bu etsɔ ŋu kpɔ.
I want it to work well.	Medi be wòawɔ dɔ nyuie.
For the first week, things were fine.	Le kwasiɖa gbãtɔ me la, nuwo nɔ nyuie.
I couldn’t quite work.	Nyemete ŋu wɔa dɔ tututu o.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
I could never do that now.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema fifia gbeɖe o.
I really enjoyed meeting everyone.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go amesiame.
No one believed him.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ edzi se o.
It was just something that happened in the past.	Nane si dzɔ va yi koe wònye.
Feed.	Na nuɖuɖu.
I couldn’t do it.	Nyemete ŋu wɔe o.
The meeting will take place tomorrow.	Kpekpea adzɔ etsɔ.
In some ways.	Le mɔ aɖewo nu.
He is in his room.	Ele eƒe xɔ me.
These two finished well.	Ame eve siawo wu enu nyuie.
It is working for me.	Ele dɔ wɔm nam.
I know where they are.	Menya afisi wole.
There was never money.	Ga menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
I am in the exact same situation.	Mele nɔnɔme ma ke tututu me.
I was just shocked, that was all.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku nam, ema koe nye ema.
I still had plenty of money at this point.	Ga geɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ asinye le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
And he did a lot of things.	Eye wòwɔ nu geɖe.
Again, no problem.	Le afisia hã la, kuxi aɖeke meli o.
Everyone knows about them.	Amesiame nya nu tso wo ŋu.
All of us.	Mí katã.
He and she together.	Eya kple eya ɖekae.
I couldn’t lie to him.	Nyemete ŋu da alakpa nɛ o.
It just doesn’t work.	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ o.
Years of time.	Ƒe geɖe ƒe ɣeyiɣi.
This is not easy for me to do.	Esia wɔwɔ mele bɔbɔe nam o.
I can handle everything.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nusianu gbɔ.
I gave him one, you gave him one.	Metsɔ ɖeka nɛ, wòe tsɔ ɖeka nɛ.
That day was probably a long time ago.	Anɔ eme be ŋkeke ma nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
Top and back.	Dzi kple megbe.
But it’s not everything.	Gake menye nusianu o.
Which is not to have a home in this place.	Nusi wònye be aƒe manɔ teƒe sia o.
Like he never wanted anything.	Abe alesi medi naneke gbeɖe o ene.
I wanted to stay.	Medi be manɔ anyi.
This seems to work.	Edze abe esia wɔa dɔ ene.
I don’t want to be alone.	Nyemedi be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi o.
I would love to know that.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be manya nya ma.
He couldn’t escape.	Mete ŋu si dzo o.
No one heard his voice.	Ame aɖeke mese eƒe gbe o.
I have never seen this before.	Nyemekpɔ esia kpɔ o.
That helped a little bit.	Ema kpe ɖe eŋu vie.
Very few one way or the other.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe le mɔ ɖeka alo bubu nu.
Like, really, really.	Abe, ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
I just wanted to say.	Ðeko medi be magblɔ be.
Now get out of here.	Azɔ do go le afisia.
I would love to share my work with you.	Adzɔ dzi nam be magblɔ nye dɔa na mi.
When two bad things do a good thing.	Ne nu gbegblẽ eve wɔ nu nyui aɖe.
It is an obvious paradox.	Enye nya si tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu si dze ƒã.
Some of them grew up.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo tsi.
The excitement in his voice irritates me.	Dzidzɔ si le eƒe gbe me la doa dziku nam.
I can’t do anything else.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
But eventually that changed.	Gake mlɔeba la, ema va trɔ.
I would like to talk to him today.	Madi be maƒo nu kplii egbea.
But two things have changed.	Gake nu eve aɖewo trɔ.
People who don’t have food.	Ame siwo si nuɖuɖu mele o.
I hope this happens but you never know.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia adzɔ gake mènya gbeɖe o.
That seems a little far-fetched.	Edze abe ema gbɔ didi vie ene.
But his work is at odds with his reputation.	Gake eƒe dɔa tsi tre ɖe ŋkɔ nyui si le eŋu ŋu.
He treated me with due respect.	Ewɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋunye kple bubu si sɔ.
He threw one way.	Etsɔ mɔ ɖeka ƒu gbe.
I am not sure now what happened to him.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi fifia be nukae dzɔ ɖe edzi o.
I came for something else.	Nu bubu aɖe tae meva ɖo.
And do some work on it.	Eye nàwɔ dɔ aɖewo ɖe edzi.
I was worried something would happen to him.	Metsi dzi be nane adzɔ ɖe edzi.
But maybe the same is true.	Gake ɖewohĩ nenema ke wòle nenema.
There is no one there.	Ame aɖeke mele afima o.
Why couldn’t he act? 	Nukatae mete ŋu wɔ nu o?
But there is another reason.	Gake susu bubu aɖe hã li.
Get out of the house.	Do go le aƒea me.
And in that first year.	Eye le ƒe gbãtɔ ma me.
It will be there.	Anɔ afima.
I needed to stay active.	Ehiã be manɔ dɔ dzi vevie.
Whatever.	Esi wònye ko.
It’s easy to get.	Eƒe asi le bɔbɔe.
The thing had a name.	Ŋkɔ nɔ nu la ŋu.
Never in a thousand years.	Le ƒe akpe ɖeka me gbeɖe o.
I rejected the dog.	Megbe nu le avu la gbɔ.
Many people have this problem.	Kuxi sia le ame geɖe ŋu.
He was the only one.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
But no one knows how to get there.	Gake ame aɖeke menya alesi wòawɔ aɖo afima o.
We are addressing this.	Míele esia gbɔ kpɔm.
I am not sure yet.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi haɖe o.
Finding these things was not easy.	Nu siawo didi menɔ bɔbɔe o.
A simple voice speaks in my ear.	Gbe bɔbɔe aɖe ƒoa nu ɖe ​​nye to me.
Or what was going on, for that matter.	Alo nusi nɔ edzi yim, le nya ma ta.
He will be here in the next hour.	Ava afisia le gaƒoƒo si gbɔna me.
Go back now.	Trɔ yi megbe azɔ.
Things are not like that.	Nuwo mele nenema o.
For one thing, there was only one.	Nu ɖekae nye be ɖeka koe nɔ eme.
I don’t know what to say to these people.	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ na ame siawo o.
I just don’t know when that day will come.	Ðeko nyemenya ɣekaɣie ŋkeke ma ava o.
No one really did that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
This is not necessary.	Esia mehiã o.
It would be better if it were you.	Anyo wu ne wòe.
You can actually do so much with that time.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ geɖe ŋutɔ kple ɣeyiɣi ma.
I could see that all day, all week.	Mete ŋu kpɔa ema ŋkeke bliboa, kwasiɖa bliboa katã.
I had a wonderful day.	Mekpɔ ŋkeke nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
You can definitely do it.	Àte ŋui godoo.
There is no one behind.	Ame aɖeke mele megbe o.
Exactly what is needed.	Nusi tututu hiã.
We have to do a lot of new work for us.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ yeye geɖe na mí.
This seems to have happened years ago.	Edze abe esia dzɔ ƒe geɖe enye sia ene.
Perhaps thousands died.	Ðewohĩ ame akpe geɖe ku.
Now, that still applies today.	Fifia, ema gakpɔtɔ le dɔ wɔm egbea.
And he lived by it.	Eye wònɔ agbe ɖe enu.
But not by much.	Gake menye to nu geɖe dzi o.
I needed a very good rest.	Mehiã dzudzɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I might have done something else.	Ðewohĩ mewɔ nu bubu aɖe hafi.
This is appropriate.	Esia sɔ.
What happened was unpleasant.	Nusi dzɔ la medze ame ŋu o.
I don’t know who else it could be.	Nyemenya ame bubu si wòate ŋu anye o.
It didn’t surprise me.	Mewɔ nuku nam o.
There’s a lot here.	Nu geɖe le afisia.
We don’t know if he can continue this.	Míenya ne ate ŋu ayi esia dzi o.
He was as calm as ever.	Eƒe dzi dze eme abe tsã ene.
In the end, the truth prevailed.	Mlɔeba la, nyateƒea ɖu dzi.
That’s one part of it.	Ema nye eƒe akpa ɖeka.
But it could be anything.	Gake ate ŋu anye nusianu.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu o.
Take a little break.	Gbɔ ɖe eme vie.
I just discovered it.	Ðeko meke ɖe eŋu teti koe nye ema.
This man is very sick.	Ŋutsu sia dze dɔ vevie.
But neither is life.	Gake agbe hã mele nenema o.
It was part of the afternoon.	Ŋdɔ ƒe akpa aɖee nye ema.
But this is not true at all.	Gake esia ya menye nyateƒe kura o.
I know it couldn’t have been easy.	Menya be mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe hafi o.
This year is different.	Ƒe sia to vovo.
Which is the most.	Nukae nye esi sɔ gbɔ wu.
Not so much in a bad way.	Menye nenema gbegbe le mɔ gbegblẽ nu o.
Thankfully it worked well.	Akpe be ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
No one was watching where they were going.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afisi yim wole la kpɔm o.
Money against money.	Ga si tsi tre ɖe ga ŋu.
Tomorrow is my day.	Etsɔ nye nye ŋkeke.
I need a car.	Mehiã ʋu.
I knew exactly what I was going to do.	Menya nusi tututu mawɔ.
I told you it didn’t work the first time.	Megblɔ na mi be mewɔ dɔ zi gbãtɔ o.
Think about who you are.	Bu ame si nènye la ŋu kpɔ.
You can do anything, there.	Àte ŋu awɔ nusianu, le afima.
But it is more important than that.	Gake ele vevie wu ema.
I will tell you the exact same thing.	Magblɔ nya ma ke tututu na mi.
You just have to be surprised.	Ðeko wòle be nàwɔ nuku na wò.
They will make a mistake.	Woawɔ vodada.
Someone who was up for no good.	Ame aɖe si nɔ ŋgɔ na nyui aɖeke o.
It’s something about my hair.	Enye nane si ku ɖe nye ɖa ŋu.
I can try it.	Mate ŋu ate kpɔ.
There are no eyes.	Ŋku aɖeke meli o.
There was no fire.	Dzo aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
We know they have no issues.	Míenya be nya aɖeke mele wo si o.
You are doing well.	Èle edzi dzem nyuie.
Let me do it this way.	Mina mawɔe alea.
I couldn’t feed them properly.	Nyemete ŋu na nuɖuɖu wo nyuie o.
I have nothing to do with my life.	Naneke meli mawɔ le nye agbe me o.
And of course, the money is a factor.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ga la nye akpa aɖe.
Arrive with plenty of time.	Va ɖo kple ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
First time here.	Zi gbãtɔ le afisia.
We don’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele mía si o.
He couldn't stand who he was.	Mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe amesi wònye ŋu o.
The reason for this is as follows.	Susu si tae esia ɖoe nye esi gbɔna.
He just couldn’t escape.	Mete ŋu si ko o.
But that was a small thing.	Gake nu sue aɖee nye ema.
Let me know if he needs anything.	Na manya ne ehiã nane.
It’s weird in a way.	Ewɔ nuku le mɔ aɖe nu.
But his mouth was stuck.	Gake eƒe nu tsi anyi.
Each one is important.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe le vevie.
But I can call him.	Gake mate ŋu aƒo ka nɛ.
There was never a problem.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
Look at that, it’s amazing!	Kpɔ ema ɖa, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ!
Everything went well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
The gun is actually pretty good.	Le nyateƒe me la, tu la nyo ŋutɔ.
Prices have gone up dramatically.	Nuwo ƒe asi yi dzi ŋutɔ.
He seemed surprised.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ ene.
I think there are two things.	Mesusu be nu eve aɖewo li.
I have to say there is more.	Ele nam be magblɔ be nu geɖe wu li.
One could very well dismiss that.	Ame ate ŋu agbe nya ma nyuie ŋutɔ.
They are very important to me.	Wole vevie nam ŋutɔ.
That’s real life.	Emae nye agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And more hair.	Kple ɖa geɖe wu.
We are not going to need his help.	Míele eƒe kpekpeɖeŋu hiã ge o.
Look for the positive in things.	Lé ŋku ɖe nu nyui siwo le nuwo ŋu la ŋu.
We cannot do this in a difficult situation.	Míate ŋu awɔ esia le nɔnɔme sesẽ me o.
I don’t know about me either.	Nye hã nyemenya nu tso ŋunye o.
But keep this in your head.	Gake tsɔ esia de ta me.
Any way, any time.	Mɔ ɖesiaɖe, ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe.
On the other hand, you do have food all winter.	Le go bubu me la, nuɖuɖu le asiwò le dzomeŋɔli bliboa me ya.
I shouldn’t have done this.	Mele be mawɔ esia o.
Something else is wrong.	Nu bubu aɖe hã gblẽ.
He never received them.	Mexɔ wo kpɔ o.
People were angry with them.	Amewo do dziku ɖe wo ŋu.
I understand that everyone is exhausted.	Mese egɔme be ɖeɖi te amesiame ŋu.
And, well, that’s someone else.	Eye, nyuie, ame bubu aɖee nye ema.
That part was so simple and true.	Akpa ma nɔ bɔbɔe eye wònye nyateƒe ale gbegbe.
Not like this morning.	Menye abe ŋdi sia ene o.
I gave up summer.	Meɖe asi le dzomeŋɔli ŋu.
It doesn’t matter.	Mehiã o.
If you have one, go away.	Ne ɖe le asiwò la, ke dzo.
I want to see some more comments here.	Medi be makpɔ nya bubu aɖewo le afisia.
A good thing, in a way.	Nu nyui aɖe, le mɔ aɖe nu.
And that’s what excites me.	Eye emae doa dzidzɔ nam.
If not, do it.	Ne menye nenema o la, wɔe.
Maybe he'll do the same thing for tomorrow.	Ðewohĩ awɔ nu ma ke na etsɔ hã.
It has a lot to like.	Nu geɖe siwo adzɔ dzi na wò le eŋu.
That means you don’t have any kind of attitude.	Ema fia be nɔnɔme aɖeke ƒomevi mele asiwò o.
He needed a good home.	Ehiã aƒe nyui aɖe.
I couldn’t prove it.	Nyemete ŋu ɖo kpe edzi o.
I felt that though.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be gake.
There is life in it, of course.	Agbe le eme ya.
Anything is possible.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
I don’t know where this excitement comes from.	Nyemenya afi si dzidzɔ sia tso o.
I think close enough is good enough.	Mesusu be te ɖe eŋu nyuie la nyo ale gbegbe.
I was so confident in him.	Meka ɖe edzi ale gbegbe.
It will be so.	Anye nenema.
We still had a lot of work to do.	Dɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ mía si míawɔ.
I am in a great state of mind.	Mele susu ƒe nɔnɔme gã aɖe me.
I have to relax.	Ele be maɖe dzi ɖi.
You take the lead, right?	Wòe xɔa ŋgɔ, alo?
I have to be that way.	Ele be manɔ nenema.
Still, take your time.	Ke hã, tsɔ wò ɣeyiɣi.
He lost everything last year.	Nusianu bu nɛ le ƒe si va yi me.
Let me try it.	Mina mate kpɔ.
I think that’s a good thing.	Mesusu be esia nye nu nyui aɖe.
I can get a job, if I need to.	Mate ŋu akpɔ dɔ, ne ehiã.
But it will do more.	Gake awɔ geɖe wu.
He didn’t do anything.	Mewɔ naneke o.
Some things stayed behind.	Nu aɖewo tsi anyi.
Desire is not a strong enough word.	Didi menye nya sesẽ si sɔ o.
I can imagine what you are going through.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nusi me tom nèle la le susu me.
We’re ready when you’re ready.	Míele klalo ne èle klalo.
And maybe it’s true.	Eye ɖewohĩ enye nyateƒe.
Express your opinion.	Ðe wò susu gblɔ.
The truth is not one thing.	Menye nu ɖeka koe nyateƒea nye o.
And he probably needs help.	Eye anɔ eme be ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu.
Few people met them.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe do go wo.
That’s what I’m thinking.	Emae nye nye susu.
Otherwise, he might not make it until morning.	Ne menye nenema o la, ɖewohĩ mate ŋu aɖo afima o vaseɖe ŋdi.
I am not alive.	Mele agbe mele o.
He did something.	Ewɔ nane.
As in rock hard.	Abe alesi wòle le sesẽ abe kpe ene me ene.
Few survived.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe tsi agbe.
It won’t work.	Mawɔ dɔ o.
I think it is now.	Mesusu be ele nenema fifia.
A few bad months, a few good ones.	Ɣleti gbegblẽ ʋɛ aɖewo, nyui ʋɛ aɖewo.
Several minor contradictions, and one major one.	Nu sue geɖe siwo tsi tre ɖe eŋu, kple gã ɖeka.
He has enough of it.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ le esi.
You have one year.	Ƒe ɖeka le asiwò.
I liked everything about it.	Nusianu si ku ɖe eŋu la dze ŋunye.
But I really like them.	Gake wo dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t understand why people were against me.	Nyemete ŋu se nusita amewo tsi tre ɖe ŋunye la gɔme o.
Making something out of nothing.	Nane wɔwɔ tso naneke me.
That means you have time on your side.	Ema fia be ɣeyiɣi le asiwò le wò akpa dzi.
But there are some aspects that can be useful.	Gake akpa aɖewo li siwo ate ŋu aɖe vi.
He threw his head back.	Etsɔ eƒe ta ƒu gbe ɖe megbe.
I'll be working late tonight.	Mawɔ dɔ le zã sia me tsi megbe.
What is lost.	Nusi bu.
He has a great thing.	Nu gã aɖe le esi.
I had to take care of the job I had.	Ele be makpɔ dɔ si nɔ asinye la gbɔ.
He gave me pieces of it.	Etsɔ eƒe akpa aɖewo nam.
That won’t be easy.	Ema mawɔ bɔbɔe o.
It probably doesn’t matter.	Anɔ eme be mehiã o.
What is the reason for it.	Nukae nye susu si tae.
He didn’t take his eyes off her.	Meɖe eƒe ŋku ɖa le eŋu o.
He lost a lot of blood.	Ʋu geɖe bu le eŋu.
Maybe a lot more.	Ðewohĩ nu geɖe wu.
You have to do something yourself.	Ele be wò ŋutɔ nàwɔ nane.
Actually, thank you.	Le nyateƒe me la, akpe na wò.
I’m not going anywhere with you.	Nyemele afi aɖeke yim kpli wò o.
Water.	Metsi.
I remember it well.	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie.
You can hear everything.	Àte ŋu ase nusianu.
And this stopped.	Eye esia tɔ te.
And it’s actually a very accurate statement.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, enye nya si sɔ ŋutɔ.
This air is hot.	Ya sia xɔ dzo.
It was just a little closer.	Enye nusi te ɖe ame ŋu vie ko.
He never did anything he didn’t want to do.	Mewɔ naneke si medi be yeawɔ o la kpɔ o.
It has never been necessary.	Mehiã kpɔ o.
Indeed.	Le nyateƒe me.
He is doing something for me.	Ele nane wɔm nam.
There is only one thing we have to do.	Nu ɖeka koe wòle be míawɔ.
A lot of them, actually.	Wo dometɔ geɖe, le nyateƒe me.
In case you don’t know.	Nenye be mènya o.
Go to the meeting today.	Yi kpekpea me egbea.
The mansion was waiting.	Aƒe gã la nɔ lalam.
He refuses to do anything wrong.	Egbea nu gbegblẽ aɖeke wɔwɔ.
One person said this and another said that.	Ame ɖeka gblɔ nya sia eye bubu gblɔ nya ma.
It can be so exciting.	Ate ŋu ado dzidzɔ na ame ale gbegbe.
I'm not sure where else.	Nyemeka ɖe teƒe bubu dzi o.
We can protect that.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ema ta.
He made a big mistake.	Ewɔ vodada gã aɖe.
It’s as simple as it gets.	Ele bɔbɔe abe alesi wòle ene.
It will come as one.	Ava abe ɖeka ene.
This will not be like any other time.	Esia manɔ abe ɣeyiɣi bubu ɖesiaɖe ene o.
He couldn’t stop it.	Mete ŋu tɔ te o.
It is something more than that.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema.
It will be waiting when you are ready.	Anɔ lalam ne èle klalo.
But that could not have happened often.	Gake ema mate ŋu adzɔ zi geɖe hafi o.
This thing is hard.	Nu sia sesẽ.
That’s really my whole point.	Emae nye nye nya bliboa ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I put myself out there.	Metsɔ ɖokuinye da ɖe afima.
That’s partly my fault.	Nye vodada ƒe akpa aɖee nye ema.
I really had nothing against it.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke menɔ asinye le eŋu o.
This may well be the case.	Esia ate ŋu anɔ alea ŋutɔ.
I already have a lot, thank you very much.	Nu geɖe le asinye xoxo, akpe geɖe na wò.
That’s the really hard part.	Emae nye akpa si sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I know you now.	Menya wò fifia.
I just worked.	Ðeko mewɔ dɔ.
We can get a job.	Míate ŋu akpɔ dɔ.
But there was an opportunity.	Gake mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe nɔ anyi.
But that is not the case.	Gake menye nya ma le alea o.
It looks good anyway.	Edze nyuie le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I’m not like everyone else.	Nyemele abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene o.
Each of us was like that.	Mía dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe nɔ nenema.
He's new here.	Enye ame yeye le afisia.
I can see why people would be impressed.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nusita amewo ƒe nu awɔ dɔ ɖe edzi.
Thanks for some comments.	Akpe na mi ɖe nya aɖewo ta.
Find something you want to do.	Di nane si nèdi be yeawɔ.
What is that ? 	Nukae nye ema?
He couldn’t sustain that.	Mete ŋu lé nya ma ɖe te o.
Police have not been able to determine how he died.	Kpovitɔwo mete ŋu nya alesi wòwɔ ku o.
That’s my life.	Emae nye nye agbe.
He needed help and he hurried.	Ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu eye wòwɔ kaba.
That would work just fine.	Ema awɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
I know why.	Menya nusi tae.
I know who he is.	Menya amesi wònye.
He didn’t expect it to take so long.	Mekpɔ mɔ be axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi nenema gbegbe o.
But come and hit the head.	Ke va ƒo ta la.
Why have more people come here?	Nukatae ame geɖe wu va le afisia?
It is working for me.	Ele dɔ wɔm nam.
I got home.	Meɖo aƒeme.
I just stay focused.	Ðeko nye susu nɔa nu ŋu.
He had his back to me.	Eƒe megbe nɔ ŋunye.
This is becoming important.	Esia va le vevie dom nu.
Something was nagging at the back of his mind.	Nane nɔ fu ɖem nɛ le eƒe susu ƒe megbe.
That was four years ago now.	Ema nye ƒe ene enye sia fifia.
This is.	Esia nye.
Now, you must not say anything to anyone.	Azɔ, mele be nàgblɔ nya aɖeke na ame aɖeke o.
Your money is in your hands.	Wò ga la le asiwò.
Not so much that my job is difficult.	Menye ale gbegbe be nye dɔa sesẽ o.
But he didn’t know what else to do.	Gake menya nu bubu si wòawɔ o.
It was wrong and we know what happened.	Enye nu gbegblẽ eye míenya nusi dzɔ.
The one in my head.	Ame si le nye ta me.
I was finally able to arrive.	Meva te ŋu va ɖo mlɔeba.
Things are very important between them.	Nuwo le vevie ŋutɔ le wo dome.
He could not raise the money to do so.	Mete ŋu dzɔ ga la wɔe nenema o.
We can’t stay.	Míate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
They never gave up.	Dzi meɖe le wo ƒo gbeɖe o.
I must be missing something really obvious though.	Anɔ eme be nane si dze ƒã ŋutɔŋutɔ la bu nam gake.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
He was thrilled that it worked out so well.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ be ewɔ dɔ nyuie alea gbegbe.
There is a serious problem in this city.	Kuxi sesẽ aɖe le du sia me.
But this is something we can do for you.	Gake esia nye nu si míate ŋu awɔ na mi.
But it’s not my job.	Gake menye nye dɔa o.
This is simply not true.	Ðeko esia menye nyateƒe o.
No one can deny that.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu agbe nya ma o.
Where did everyone go?	Afikae amesiame yi?
Are you.	Èle.
And the shape of the car.	Eye ʋua ƒe nɔnɔme.
That is so far from the truth.	Ema didi tso nyateƒea gbɔ ale gbegbe.
But at this point, no one was going anywhere.	Gake le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, ame aɖeke menɔ afi aɖeke yim o.
Too many problems.	Kuxi geɖe akpa.
Try to do that.	Dze agbagba nàwɔ ema.
I want to make one, too.	Medi be mawɔ ɖeka, nye hã.
I believe in it.	Mexɔ edzi se.
The process takes weeks.	Dɔa wɔwɔ xɔa kwasiɖa geɖe.
I am fine on my own.	Mele nyuie le ɖokuinye si.
Maybe I should explain this.	Ðewohĩ ele be maɖe nya sia me.
No one ever said a word.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke kpɔ o.
He can’t just go.	Mate ŋu ayi ko o.
She lives alone with her dog.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔa anyi kple eƒe avu.
There are many dehydrated foods on the market.	Nuɖuɖu siwo me tsi mele o geɖe le asi me.
He had lost so much.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ bu nɛ.
Some of them make sense.	Susu le wo dometɔ aɖewo me.
I know these guys pretty well.	Menya ŋutsu siawo nyuie ŋutɔ.
This face.	Mo sia.
Again, this seems to make sense.	Le afisia hã la, edze abe susu le nya sia me ene.
Everyone described him as a great man.	Amesiame gblɔ tso eŋu be enye ame gã aɖe.
Time is so short, death comes so quickly.	Ɣeyiɣi le kpuie ale gbegbe, ku va kaba ale gbegbe.
I like what he’s doing.	Nusi wɔm wòle la dzɔa dzi nam.
He probably won’t.	Ðewohĩ mawɔe nenema o.
Can't really do that right now.	Mate ŋu awɔ ema ŋutɔŋutɔ fifia o.
But it didn’t bother him.	Gake meɖe fu nɛ o.
We know there has to be a better way.	Míenya be ele be mɔ si nyo wu nanɔ anyi.
Think about it very carefully.	Bu eŋu nyuie ŋutɔ.
There is a lot to do.	Nu geɖe li woawɔ.
I am the complete opposite.	Nyee nye amesi to vovo kura na ema.
I did indeed do it.	Mewɔe nyateƒe.
Too much food in summer, and too little in summer.	Nuɖuɖu geɖe akpa le dzomeŋɔli, eye nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe le dzomeŋɔli.
This could definitely be an issue.	Esia ate ŋu anye nya aɖe godoo.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Difficult times.	Ɣeyiɣi sesẽ.
This is a very good one.	Esia nye esi nyo ŋutɔ.
That’s the only real issue here.	Ema koe nye nya ŋutɔŋutɔ si le afisia.
It was just an idea of ​​mine.	Nye susu aɖe koe wònye.
Neither did my heart.	Nye dzi hã mewɔe nenema o.
Water is vital to life.	Tsi le vevie ŋutɔ na agbe.
He was once a man.	Ame aɖee wònye tsã.
Another man joined them.	Ŋutsu bubu hã va kpe ɖe wo ŋu.
I threw myself forward.	Metsɔ ɖokuinye ƒu gbe ɖe ŋgɔ.
I’m surprised how well it’s going.	Ewɔ nuku nam be alesi wòle edzi yim nyuie.
I saw that here somewhere.	Mekpɔ ema le afisia le afi aɖe.
Who ‘we’ are.	Ame siwo ‘mí’ míenye.
But there is something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã li.
Where we are.	Afisi míele.
There is no machine that can replace people.	Mɔ̃ aɖeke meli si ate ŋu axɔ ɖe amewo teƒe o.
This is the first one.	Esia nye gbãtɔ.
We can make a lot of money from this project.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ga geɖe tso dɔ sia me.
As it stands, right now.	Abe alesi wòle, fifia ene.
That’s why he’s here.	Esia tae wòle afisia ɖo.
And in that case .	Eye le nɔnɔme ma me la .
He has a gun in his hand.	Tu le esi le esi.
A really good book.	Agbalẽ nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Think of it this way.	Bu eŋu alea.
I want to stay in my job.	Medi be mayi edzi anɔ nye dɔa me.
Also, it’s very simple.	Azɔ hã, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
His tongue could not decide.	Eƒe aɖe mete ŋu tso nya me o.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
That surprised me a lot.	Ema wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
The real kind.	Amesi ƒomevi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You don’t want to go either.	Wò hã mèdi be yeayi o.
I had to step on them.	Ele be maɖe afɔ ɖe wo dzi.
In fact, he never does.	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
That’s right, too.	Ema hã sɔ.
Here we don’t seem to have that man.	Le afisia la, edze abe ŋutsu ma mele mía si o ene.
None of them were like that.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ nenema o.
It was a great house.	Aƒe gã aɖee wònye.
Through fire fire fire.	To dzo me dzo dzo.
The logic was simple.	Susu si le eme la nɔ bɔbɔe.
No one wants the truth.	Ame aɖeke medi nyateƒea o.
Everything takes time.	Nusianu xɔa ɣeyiɣi.
This is just a great thing.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe ko.
I need to be able to do this.	Ele be mate ŋu awɔ esia.
I have been here before.	Menɔ afisia kpɔ.
This book is very expensive.	Agbalẽ sia xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
But he can say a few things about it.	Gake ate ŋu agblɔ nya ʋɛ aɖewo tso eŋu.
It seems like.	Edze abe.
Like you just now.	Abe wò fifia ko ene.
He wasn't going anywhere now.	Menɔ afi aɖeke yim fifia o.
And the week before that was.	Eye kwasiɖa si do ŋgɔ na emae nye.
I was on it for about four months.	Menɔ edzi anɔ abe ɣleti ene ene.
This is really just a statement.	Le nyateƒe me la, nya aɖe koe nye esia.
Everything went well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
It’s not something like that.	Menye nane si le nenema o.
It’s a way of time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi ƒe mɔ aɖe.
And it can be helpful.	Eye ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu.
Come on, everyone.	Va, amesiame.
There is much to this situation.	Nu geɖe le nɔnɔme sia ŋu.
I challenged myself.	Metsɔ nya ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu.
Money, for one thing.	Ga, le nu ɖeka ta.
In fact, the opposite seems to be true.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze abe nusi to vovo kura na emae nye nyateƒe ene.
I have to do it myself.	Ele be nye ŋutɔ mawɔe.
I only had two and that was a while ago.	Eve koe nɔ asinye eye ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye ema va yi.
I’ve found it.	Meke ɖe eŋu.
That annoyed me.	Ema do dziku nam.
I was getting angry.	Menɔ dziku dom.
I'm right there.	Nyee le afima tututu.
Not in anything.	Menye le naneke me o.
That says something.	Ema gblɔ nya aɖe.
Got out that year.	Do go le ƒe ma me.
It is best to plan ahead.	Anyo wu be nàwɔ ɖoɖo do ŋgɔ.
, and not the final book.	, eye menye agbalẽ mamlɛtɔ o.
Or maybe it won’t.	Alo ɖewohĩ mawɔe nenema o.
It was almost four.	Enye ene kloe.
I did it.	Mewɔe.
But it can be a bad thing.	Gake ate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
Do it quickly.	Wɔe kaba.
And he wasn’t alone.	Eye menye eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi o.
We don’t have water.	Tsi mele mía si o.
This season was amazing.	Ɣeyiɣi sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I’m not sure what to make of it yet.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ tso eŋu dzi haɖe o.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe li siwo tae wòle alea ɖo.
Please confirm that you wish to do this.	Taflatse ɖo kpe edzi be yedi be yeawɔ esia.
Everyone was fine, more or less.	Amesiame nɔ nyuie, wu alo wu nenema.
Get lost and it’s waiting for you.	Bu eye wòle lalam na wò.
There’s probably a reason for that.	Anɔ eme be susu aɖe li si tae wòle nenema ɖo.
Let me try and explain.	Mina mate kpɔ eye maɖe eme.
What else should I do here.	Nu bubu kae wòle be mawɔ le afisia.
Something must be wrong.	Ele be nane gblẽ.
But it never stayed that way for long.	Gake menɔ anyi nenema ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke kpɔ o.
No man in my life has ever done that to me.	Ŋutsu aɖeke mewɔ nu ma nam kpɔ le nye agbe me o.
He had some books for me.	Agbalẽ aɖewo nɔ esi nam.
Now this is more obvious than ever.	Fifia esia dze ƒã wu tsã.
The expression on his face was worried.	Ale si eƒe mo nɔ la tsi dzi.
We have a lot of work to do.	Dɔ geɖe le mía si.
Find another job.	Di dɔ bubu aɖe.
Our teacher was very difficult.	Míaƒe nufiala sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I did the same thing.	Nye hã mewɔe nenema.
It is in excellent condition.	Ele nɔnɔme nyui aɖe me.
However, it is not working.	Ke hã, mele dɔ wɔm o.
Now there was no one there.	Fifia ame aɖeke menɔ afi ma o.
He is going to save people.	Ele amewo xɔ ge.
How did he change so quickly?	Aleke wòwɔ trɔ kaba nenema?
Do good to those who hate you.	Wɔ nyui na ame siwo lé fu wò.
He really can’t do that.	Le nyateƒe me la, mate ŋu awɔ ema o.
I worked on it.	Mewɔ dɔ le eŋu.
It’s for everyone.	Enye na amesiame.
Everyone has a role to play.	Akpa aɖe le amesiame si wòawɔ.
Shortly after one o'clock the wind blew.	Le ga ɖeka megbe kpuie la, ya ƒo sesĩe.
Now it needs a new name.	Fifia ehiã ŋkɔ yeye.
I like everything about it.	Nusianu si ku ɖe eŋu la dzɔa dzi nam.
I think everyone knows that.	Mesusu be amesiame nya esia.
Everything seemed easy.	Edze abe nusianu nɔ bɔbɔe ene.
He tried to sit up, but couldn't keep his balance.	Edze agbagba be yeanɔ anyi, gake mete ŋu da sɔ o.
Only, it would have been one he did.	Ðeko, anye ne ɖeka si wòwɔ hafi.
I just refused.	Ðeko megbe.
And my heart, too.	Eye nye dzi hã.
This should be in the form of either.	Ele be esia nanɔ nɔnɔme si nye alo.
I can’t help them.	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe wo ŋu o.
They are talking about it.	Wole nu ƒom tso eŋu.
You are a great person.	Ènye ame gã aɖe.
Open your heart to him.	Ʋu wò dzi nɛ.
They had one man there, and only one man.	Ŋutsu ɖeka nɔ wo si le afi ma, eye ŋutsu ɖeka koe nɔ wo si.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
And the one before it.	Eye esi do ŋgɔ nɛ.
Clearly, someone did.	Edze ƒã be ame aɖe wɔe nenema.
He needed blood.	Ehiã ʋu.
This worked great for us.	Esia wɔ dɔ ŋutɔ na mí.
One person knows another.	Ame ɖeka nya bubu.
A horse responded sharply.	Sɔ aɖe ɖo eŋu vevie.
Trust me, you’ll have a lot of fun there.	Ka ɖe dzinye, adzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ le afima.
But be careful what you wish for.	Gake kpɔ nyuie le nusi nèdi ŋu.
Everything is in it.	Nusianu le eme.
You know exactly what to do.	Ènya nusi tututu nàwɔ.
He can’t see anything like that.	Mate ŋu akpɔ naneke nenema o.
I have been in that situation.	Menɔ nɔnɔme ma me kpɔ.
There are a lot of people.	Amewo sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
Do so much more with one car.	Wɔ nu geɖe wu nenema kple ʋu ɖeka.
I could hardly contain myself after that.	Nyemete ŋu lé ɖokuinye nu kura le ema megbe o.
Or something like that .	Alo nane si le abe ema ene .
He escaped with his life.	Esi kple eƒe agbe.
There was something in it.	Nane nɔ eme.
He had a bloody mind.	Susu ʋu nɔ esi.
I still had a job to do.	Dɔ aɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ asinye mawɔ.
It was a great book for me.	Enye agbalẽ gã aɖe nam.
This sounds expensive.	Esia ɖi nusi xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
That’s not nearly as surprising.	Ema menye nusi wɔ nuku kloe o.
By doing this.	To esia wɔwɔ me.
You just have to tell them the truth.	Ðeko wòle be nàgblɔ nyateƒea na wo.
That’s what we’re focused on.	Emae nye nusi ŋu míaƒe susu le.
He lost his job.	Dɔ ge le esi.
There is only one truth.	Nyateƒe ɖeka koe li.
It’s a whole new thing.	Enye nu yeye kura.
Quite against character.	Tsi tre ɖe nɔnɔme ŋu kura.
What’s the little thing that matters?	Nukae nye nu sue aɖe si le vevie?
Now it’s just a matter of doing my job.	Fifia nye dɔa wɔwɔ ƒe nya aɖe koe wònye.
He did what he liked.	Ewɔ nu si dze eŋu.
These tribes disappeared.	To siawo bu.
They are eating from house to house.	Wole nu ɖum le aƒe kple aƒeme.
People are resigning every other day.	Amewo le asi ɖem le dɔ ŋu ŋkeke eve ɖesiaɖe.
Come, take a closer look.	Va, lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie.
I liked this better.	Esia dze ŋunye wu.
He couldn’t achieve anything at all.	Mete ŋu ɖo naneke kura gbɔ o.
Everything points in that direction.	Nusianu fia asi mɔ ma.
But leave that aside.	Gake gblẽ nya ma ɖe akpa ɖeka.
It doesn’t make sense.	Susu mele eme o.
I have a house now.	Aƒe le asinye fifia.
I found a way.	Mekpɔ mɔ aɖe.
I'm not quite sure what the word means.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi nya la fia dzi tututu o.
And we will have help.	Eye kpekpeɖeŋu anɔ mía si.
He was a man who spoke from his heart.	Enye ŋutsu aɖe si ƒoa nu tso eƒe dzi me.
He had never been sick.	Medze dɔ kpɔ o.
This house is very old.	Aƒe sia do xoxo ŋutɔ.
For about a year.	Anɔ abe ƒe ɖeka ene.
We knew it would be a challenge.	Míenya be anye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
But the issue remains money.	Gake nya la gakpɔtɔ nye ga.
Think about it now.	Bu eŋu kpɔ azɔ.
It’s almost really weird.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ kloe.
But not there.	Gake menye le afima o.
If you can talk about it.	Ne àte ŋu aƒo nu tso eŋu.
But there is still time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi gakpɔtɔ li.
This will make the meeting more organized.	Esia ana woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe kpekpea ŋu wu.
Move there with him.	Ʋu yi afima kplii.
This is not necessarily a good thing.	Esia menye nu nyui aɖe kokoko o.
He was a very small man.	Enye ame sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
I said the same thing here.	Megblɔ nya sia ke le afisia.
He was often very untidy.	Zi geɖe la, mewɔa nu ɖe ​​ɖoɖo nu ale gbegbe o.
However, you have another problem.	Ke hã, kuxi bubu aɖe hã le ŋuwò.
We could have found a way.	Míate ŋu ake ɖe mɔ aɖe ŋu hafi.
Weird.	To vovo.
I never looked at the room.	Nyemekpɔ xɔa me kpɔ o.
We only had one car.	Ʋu ɖeka koe nɔ mía si.
It would have been great.	Anyo ŋutɔ hafi.
No serious complications occurred.	Kuxi sesẽ aɖeke medo mo ɖa o.
It seemed like hours had passed.	Edze abe gaƒoƒo geɖe va yi ene.
He will be here too.	Eya hã anɔ afisia.
We can escape.	Míate ŋu asi.
I usually have the house to myself.	Zi geɖe la, aƒea nɔa asinye na ɖokuinye.
In fact, it felt nothing at all.	Le nyateƒe me la, mese le eɖokui me be naneke kura o.
My life was just beginning.	Ðeko nye agbe dze egɔme teti koe nye ema.
He acted rationally.	Ewɔ nu le susu me.
This was really hard for me.	Esia sesẽ nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He just wasn't there now.	Ðeko menɔ afima fifia o.
Again, that one moment is enough.	Le afisia hã la, ɣeyiɣi ɖeka ma sɔ gbɔ.
It’s a small and wonderful thing.	Enye nu sue aɖe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It worked well for me.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie nam.
It has worked for a long time.	Ewɔ dɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
He was surprised at how easy it was.	Ale si wònɔ bɔbɔe la wɔ nuku nɛ.
There is a real reason.	Susu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe li si tae.
He didn’t know how to make anything out of money.	Menya alesi wòawɔ akpɔ naneke le ga me o.
He needed to plan for it.	Ehiã be wòawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
It was a good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖee wònye.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
They all work well.	Wo katã wɔa dɔ nyuie.
I told him that too.	Megblɔ nya ma nɛ hã.
He didn’t do anything.	Mewɔ naneke o.
And everything went well.	Eye nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
I'm not angry that you can't let go yet.	Medo dziku nɛ be màte ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu haɖe o.
At an earlier time.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe si do ŋgɔ me.
That was a job.	Dɔ aɖee nye ema.
He’s sick.	Edze dɔ.
It’s a good thing.	Enye nu nyui aɖe.
We don’t know his name.	Míenya eƒe ŋkɔ o.
And that made sense, as you worked through it.	Eye susu nɔ ema me, esi nèwɔ dɔ le eŋu to eme.
A year of hard work, in one afternoon.	Dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ ƒe ɖeka, le ŋdɔ ɖeka me.
He didn’t know where he was.	Menya afi si wòle o.
I would say as much to him.	Magblɔ nya ma gbegbe na eya hã.
I have so much to tell him, so much to explain.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye magblɔ nɛ, nu geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye maɖe eme.
Beware of the dog.	Kpɔ nyuie le avu la ŋu.
This is something new to me.	Esia nye nu yeye nam.
There was no food.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
That worked for me.	Ema wɔ dɔ nam.
It is so unnecessary.	Enye nusi mehiã o ale gbegbe.
Much more in fact.	Nu geɖe wu le nyateƒe me.
One eye popped up.	Ŋku ɖeka do ɖe dzi.
But it may not be so simple.	Gake ɖewohĩ mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
It is more than just the law.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu se la ko.
Go back to work.	Trɔ yi dɔme.
I need to talk to you about some things.	Ehiã be maƒo nu tso nu aɖewo ŋu na wò.
If you're a.	Ne wò ɖe.
But I hope help is coming.	Gake mele mɔ kpɔm be kpekpeɖeŋu gbɔna.
You can let him do that.	Àte ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu wòawɔ ema.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
In the end, there are too many of us.	Mlɔeba la, mía dometɔ geɖe sɔ gbɔ akpa.
Now help me here.	Azɔ kpe ɖe ŋunye le afisia.
You need bone surgery.	Ehiã be woawɔ dɔ na wò ƒu.
Be careful!	Kpɔ nyuie!
This has resulted in	Esia na be .
Anything seems possible there.	Edze abe nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ le afima ene.
Be a real person.	Nye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.

Everyone fell over.	Amesiame dze anyi ɖe edzi.
It is now a private home.	Fifia enye ame ŋutɔ ƒe aƒe.
I'm just angry with you.	Ðeko medo dziku ɖe ŋuwò.
I don’t want to fight.	Nyemedi be mawɔ avu o.
He couldn’t lift his head at all.	Mete ŋu kɔ ta dzi kura o.
They had two children.	Vi eve nɔ wo si.
There is none of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
His house was on the way, sort of.	Eƒe aƒe nɔ mɔ dzi, ƒomevi aɖe.
Everyone is doing a lot of work.	Amesiame le dɔ geɖe wɔm.
But only to a certain extent.	Gake vaseɖe afi aɖe ko.
So were others from the house.	Nenema ke ame bubu siwo tso aƒea me hã nɔ.
I was the damage.	Nyee nye nusi gblẽ le ŋunye.
He fell backwards into a bush.	Edze anyi ɖe megbe yi gbe aɖe me.
I wouldn’t have been surprised.	Anye ne mawɔ nuku nam o.
I can’t see you like this.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wò alea o.
He will need that.	Ahiã ema.
I just wanted to be on my own.	Ðeko medi be manɔ ɖokuinye si.
His mind was working.	Eƒe susu nɔ dɔ wɔm.
There was someone inside.	Ame aɖe nɔ eme.
It would be really new if there was one.	Anye nu yeye ŋutɔŋutɔ ne ɖe li.
Two roads converge near here.	Mɔ eve ƒo ƒu ɖe afisia gbɔ.
He might have been depressed.	Ðewohĩ nu te ɖe edzi hafi.
I’m glad you’re there.	Edzɔ dzi nam be èle afima.
This is a fine old building.	Esia nye xɔ xoxo nyui aɖe.
That search was a first for me.	Didi ma nye gbãtɔ nam.
In each case, .	Le nya ɖesiaɖe me la, .
There doesn’t have to be one.	Mehiã be ɖeke nanɔ anyi o.
He had no life of his own.	Agbe aɖeke menɔ esi le eɖokui si o.
There is a hole in my heart.	Do aɖe le nye dzi me.
Now you are not like that.	Fifia mèle nenema o.
Stop them if you can.	Dzudzɔ wo ne àte ŋui.
He seemed to have lost all consciousness.	Edze abe eƒe susu katã bu ene.
I remember what it was like.	Meɖo ŋku alesi wònɔ la dzi.
What they’re doing, what they’re planning.	Nusi wɔm wole, nusi ŋu wole ɖoɖo wɔm ɖo.
I would love to know what it is.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be manya nusi wònye.
All those interested in doing that died.	Ame siwo katã tsɔ ɖe le ema wɔwɔ me la ku.
I thought it was amazing.	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I surprised him a lot.	Mewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
I think it will take longer.	Mesusu be axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi wu.
It’s not a good thing at all.	Menye nu nyui aɖeke kura o.
It’s a normal thing.	Enye nusi sɔ.
It didn’t turn out well.	Meva eme nyuie hafi o.
Someone who is a good person.	Ame aɖe si nye ame nyui aɖe.
It can be anyone, from anywhere.	Ate ŋu anye amesiame, tso afi sia afi.
In fact, it seems to help.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze abe kpe ɖe eŋu ene.
He can’t do much more.	Mate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe wu o.
He didn’t ask questions.	Mebia nya o.
My hair is really long.	Nye ɖa didi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I have been there before.	Menɔ afima kpɔ.
You have to deal with them.	Ele be nàwɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu.

A very good thing.	Nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.

But this is also unrealistic.	Gake esia hã menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.

It is of course a distinct possibility.	Enye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ si to vovo ya.

Now you have to do something about it.	Fifia ele be nàwɔ nane tso eŋu.
We can’t go on like that.	Míate ŋu ayi edzi nenema o.
Stop the car.	Tsɔ ʋua tɔ.
Things that really matter.	Nu siwo le vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
They don’t have guns.	Tu mele wo si o.
Some kind of obsession.	Nusi xɔa susu me na ame aɖe ƒomevi.

Live for today.	Nɔ agbe na egbea.
I doubt that will be easy.	Meke ɖi be ema anɔ bɔbɔe.
Each of us.	Mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
One death here, one death there.	Ku ɖeka le afisia, ku ɖeka le afima.
It is impossible for two people.	Manya wɔ na ame eve o.
This is not that close at all.	Esia mete ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu nenema gbegbe kura o.
Each is a dead end.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe nye mɔ si dzi ame aɖeke mele o.
It may be good to keep the truth in mind.	Ate ŋu anyo be nyateƒea nanɔ susu me na mí.
In fact, there is no other book like it.	Le nyateƒe me la, agbalẽ bubu aɖeke meli si sɔ kplii o.
I think this worked, a lot of people didn’t.	Mesusu be esia wɔ dɔ, ame geɖe mewɔe o.
There was definitely a lot to this.	Nu geɖe nɔ esia ŋu godoo.
There were several men behind him in the room.	Ŋutsu geɖe nɔ megbe nɛ le xɔa me.
No one has answered or confirmed that this works.	Ame aɖeke meɖo eŋu alo ɖo kpe edzi be esia wɔa dɔ o.
It is the first.	Enye gbãtɔ.
Now be a good person.	Azɔ nye ame nyui.
That’s the one.	Emae nye esi.
I finally realized this and decided to do something about it.	Meva kpɔ esia dze sii mlɔeba eye meɖoe be mawɔ nane tso eŋu.
It can be walked.	Ate ŋu azɔ.
I hope he doesn’t go.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mayi o.
It was a nice house.	Aƒe nyui aɖee wònye.
But we could get ahead maybe, if we could stay here longer.	Gake míate ŋu ado ŋgɔ ɖewohĩ, nenye be míate ŋu anɔ afisia ɣeyiɣi didi wu.
His mind was elsewhere.	Eƒe susu nɔ teƒe bubu.
I can’t hear any of it.	Nyemate ŋu ase wo dometɔ aɖeke le eme o.
It’s a fascinating thing.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame.
This will be more useful.	Esia aɖe vi wu.
Everyone knows that much.	Amesiame nya nu ma gbegbe.
We can go home.	Míate ŋu ayi aƒeme.
I’m not so sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o.
But there is another side to it.	Gake eƒe akpa bubu aɖe hã li.
I knew this could happen.	Menya be esia ate ŋu adzɔ.
We are a person.	Míenye ame aɖe.
But that’s me.	Gake nyee nye ema.
Please reach out.	Taflatse do asi ɖa.
That’s the most interesting thing yet.	Emae nye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame wu ɖesiaɖe vaseɖe fifia.
I have tested this and this is true.	Medo esia kpɔ eye esia nye nyateƒe.
I want to stay in my room.	Medi be manɔ nye xɔ me.
The room was comfortable.	Xɔa me nɔ bɔbɔe.
And the head of the mountain.	Le ta la to.
The price per room is per room.	Xɔ ɖeka ƒe asi nye xɔ ɖeka tɔ.
I’ve never felt that way before.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o.
I felt the same way.	Nye hã mese le ɖokuinye me nenema ke.

I had money and a gun.	Ga kple tu nɔ asinye.
And this is a fact.	Eye esia nye nyateƒe.
Just please let it go.	Ðeko taflatse ɖe asi le eŋu.
But not for blood.	Gake menye na ʋu o.

I hope you are okay with that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be èle nyuie le nya ma me.
The work took hours.	Dɔa xɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe.
I couldn’t bear it.	Nyemete ŋu do dzi o.
The spontaneity is amazing.	Nusi dzɔ le eɖokui si la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That’s four times as many.	Ema zi gbɔ zi ame ene.
Or maybe he can’t do that.	Alo ɖewohĩ mate ŋu awɔe nenema o.
Maybe it’s possible to be happy.	Ðewohĩ anya wɔ be makpɔ dzidzɔ.
He could have done it easily, but he had a better idea.	Ate ŋu awɔe bɔbɔe, gake susu si nyo wu nɔ esi.
Many have struggled, myself included.	Ame geɖe wɔ avu, nye ŋutɔ hã mele eme.
It was impossible for me to continue.	Manya wɔ nam be mayi edzi o.
He had this one.	Esia nɔ esi.
Please save me now!	Taflatse ɖem fifia!
But I managed to survive.	Gake mete ŋu tsi agbe.
It's been a long time since my last update.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia tso esime mewɔ yeye mamlɛtɔ.
He agreed with her.	Ewɔ ɖeka kplii.
It was a huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖee wònye.
He did it alone.	Eya ɖeka koe wɔe.
But look at this.	Gake lé ŋku ɖe esia ŋu.
Four days later she gave birth.	Le ŋkeke ene megbe la, edzi vi.
I just kind of touched on it.	Ðeko meka asi eŋu le mɔ aɖe nu le eme.
Nor is that a possibility in the near future.	Eye ema hã menye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ le etsɔ si gbɔna kpuie me o.
This is very easy to do.	Esia wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
That’s not what it is.	Menye emae nye nusi o.
This is a really nice place.	Esia nye teƒe nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
What is wrong with you guys?.	Nukae gblẽ le mi amewo ŋu?.
This time, it’s a simple one.	Fifia ya, enye esi le bɔbɔe.
Someone must have a point.	Ele be nya aɖe nanɔ ame aɖe si.
Not loudly by any means.	Menye sesĩe le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I liked him very, very much.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
Just think about it for a moment.	Bu eŋu kpɔ vie ko.
I had to be ready.	Ele be manɔ klalo.

That, too, is new.	Ema hã nye nu yeye.
He should have worked harder.	Ðe wòle be wòawɔ dɔ sesĩe wu hafi.
Nothing about this violates any kind of law.	Naneke mele esia ŋu si da le se ƒomevi aɖeke dzi o.
But that didn’t bother him.	Gake ema meɖe fu nɛ o.
This is really simple.	Esia le bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.

I want to address four points.	Medi be maƒo nu tso nya ene ŋu.
I tried to be kind.	Medze agbagba be mawɔ nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu nyuie.
That’s actually true most of the time.	Ema nye nyateƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ zi geɖe.
Just do the right thing.	Nu si le eteƒe koe wɔ.
Early.	Kaba.
Soon after, he collapsed.	Ema megbe kpuie la, edze anyi.
Things went on like this for days.	Nuwo yi edzi nenema ŋkeke geɖe.
He will kill you just because he can.	Awu wò le esi wòate ŋui ta ko.
And that kind of thing happened in real life.	Eye nu ma ƒomevi dzɔ le agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ hã me.
Everything has changed.	Nusianu trɔ.
My own car missed some steps.	Nye ŋutɔ nye ʋua to afɔ aɖewo dzi.
But that would be a bad thing.	Gake ema anye nu gbegblẽ.
This process will likely take months.	Anɔ eme be dɔ sia wɔwɔ axɔ ɣleti geɖe.
Maybe that would be better.	Ðewohĩ emae anyo wu.
He doesn’t do this.	Mewɔa esia o.
Yet his face changed sharply.	Ke hã eƒe mo trɔ sesĩe.
Without it, he would have nothing.	Eya manɔmee la, naneke manɔ esi o.
And he had it.	Eye wònɔ esi.
A lot of things.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
Just like you are.	Abe alesi nèle ene.
I don’t want to get involved in this.	Nyemedi be maƒo ɖokuinye ɖe esia me o.

We are moving forward and we will do this.	Míele ŋgɔ yim eye míawɔ esia.
I really wanted to do that.	Medi vevie be mawɔe nenema.
Move on with your life.	Yi edzi le wò agbe me.
That’s a good part.	Ema nye akpa nyui aɖe.
We need to be able to help each other.	Ele be míate ŋu akpe ɖe mía nɔewo ŋu.
You said the right things.	Ègblɔ nya siwo sɔ.
There is no one ahead of him.	Ame aɖeke mele ŋgɔ nɛ o.
There is no money for that.	Ga aɖeke mele ema ŋu o.
I don’t think anyone can.	Nyemesusu be ame aɖeke mate ŋui o.
Pay more attention to it.	Lé to ɖe eŋu geɖe wu.
This is impossible to happen.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
There is no good reason for that.	Susu nyui aɖeke meli si tae wòle nenema ɖo o.
You are the closest thing.	Wòe nye nu si te ɖe ŋuwò wu.

The fun thing is that they don’t have to work that hard.	Nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame enye be mehiã be woawɔ dɔ sesĩe nenema gbegbe o.

That much is right.	Nu geɖe ma sɔ.

He made the mistake of living it.	Ewɔ vodada be yeanɔ agbe ɖe enu.
I didn’t have room for them.	Teƒe menɔ asinye na wo o.
I think it’s true.	Mesusu be enye nyateƒe.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I ordered too much food.	Mebia nuɖuɖu geɖe akpa.
He looked like he was planning to go somewhere.	Edze abe ɖe wònɔ ɖoɖo wɔm be yeayi afi aɖe ene.
During this time, sweating is lighter.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, fifia nɔa bɔbɔe wu.
He never took his eyes off me.	Meɖe eƒe ŋku ɖa le ŋunye gbeɖe o.

Some real moments are close, yet not the same.	Ɣeyiɣi ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖewo te ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu, ke hã menye ɖekae o.

People got smaller.	Amewo va nɔ sue wu.
We never had parallel covers.	Agbalẽ ƒe akpa siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo menɔ mía si kpɔ o.
But the truth is something else.	Gake nyateƒea nye nu bubu aɖe.

He can’t stay here.	Mate ŋu anɔ afisia o.
Fire and police had just arrived.	Ðeko dzo kple kpovitɔwo va ɖo teti koe nye ema.
Neither of us said much in the car.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke megblɔ nya geɖe le ʋua me o.
No one does it better.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa esia nyuie wu o.
I got that in my head.	Mexɔ ema ɖe nye ta me.
And this teacher was real.	Eye nufiala sia nɔ anyi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He added them in his head.	Etsɔ wo kpe ɖe eŋu le eƒe ta me.
It couldn’t have been a good thing.	Mate ŋu anye nu nyui aɖe hafi o.
Bad blood there.	Ʋu gbegblẽ le afima.
I never understood them.	Nyemese wo gɔme kpɔ o.
You can count on us!.	Àte ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe mía ŋu!.
That used to be a lie.	Ema nye alakpa tsã.
But he did something tonight that you can’t take away from him.	Gake ewɔ nane le zã sia me si màte ŋu axɔ le esi o.
I'm going to keep my mouth shut.	Mele nye nu ƒom.
You can do what you have.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu si le asiwò.
He wasn’t angry.	Dziku menɔ eŋu o.
I just didn’t know anything about it.	Ðeko nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o.
He hurried to another room.	Ewɔ kaba yi xɔ bubu me.

This is why we have to act.	Esia tae wòle be míawɔ nu ɖo.
Do those two things.	Wɔ nu eve ma.
That happened, too.	Ema hã dzɔ.

Someone has to do something about that.	Ele be ame aɖe nawɔ nane tso ema ŋu.
Stand up for your man.	Tsi tre ɖe wò ame ŋu.
This is impossible to happen.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
That would be really great.	Ema anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.

This is not true.	Esia menye nyateƒe o.
A town of a few thousand people	Du aɖe si me ame akpe ʋɛ aɖewo le
You can do anything.	Àte ŋu awɔ nusianu.
No one else was giving him any good sense.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ susu nyui aɖeke ɖem fia nɛ o.
This saved me a lot.	Esia xɔ nam ŋutɔ.
I was very impressed with him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ.

Live to fight another day, another way.	Nɔ agbe nàwɔ avu ŋkeke bubu, mɔ bubu.
Everything depends on me, but with this.	Nusianu nɔ te ɖe dzinye, gake kple esia.
I thought he could do nothing but help us.	Mesusu be mate ŋu awɔ naneke wu kpekpeɖeŋu na mí ko o.
But, honestly, there’s no real reason why it isn’t.	Gake, le nyateƒe me la, susu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke meli si tae mele nenema o.
He is not acting rationally.	Menye ɖe wòle nu wɔm le susu me o.
This is very realistic.	Esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
And he won’t talk about it.	Eye maƒo nu tso eŋu o.
It is that simple!.	Enye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe!.
Stone is a hard little thing.	Kpe nye nu sue sesẽ aɖe.

I don’t think they need to fight it.	Nyemesusu be mehiã be woawɔ avu kplii o.

Many of them are like that.	Wo dometɔ geɖe le nenema.
He had a reason.	Susu aɖe nɔ esi.
This new building is effectively watertight.	Xɔ yeye sia nye nusi me tsi mele o nyuie.
I don’t think that’s what he wanted.	Nyemesusu be emae nye nusi dim wònɔ o.
That’s totally absurd.	Ema nye nya si me susu mele kura o.
A single man.	Ŋutsu tre aɖe.
A house is a house.	Aƒe nye aƒe.
He did his job too well.	Ewɔ eƒe dɔa nyuie akpa.
It will make the job much easier for him.	Ana dɔa nanɔ bɔbɔe nɛ ŋutɔ.
He hurried through.	Ewɔ kaba to afima.
And that’s enough.	Eye ema sɔ gbɔ.
We are fighting together.	Míele avu wɔm ɖekae.
Nothing good ever seemed to come of it in the end.	Edze abe nu nyui aɖeke meva dzɔ ɖe wo dzi mlɔeba gbeɖe o ene.
He can do anything.	Ate ŋu awɔ nusianu.
He tried one last time.	Edze agbagba zi mamlɛtɔ.

The status quo is not working.	Nɔnɔme si li fifia mele dɔ wɔm o.
They don’t have this word.	Nya sia mele wo me o.
Let this place stay.	Teƒe sia nanɔ anyi.
Or something similar.	Alo nane si sɔ kplii.
That suddenly became clear.	Ema me kɔ zi ɖeka.

The lake got warmer.	Ta la xɔ dzo ɖe edzi.

This is very important for many people.	Esia le vevie ŋutɔ na ame geɖe.
Or for the sake of money.	Alo ɖe ga ta.

That was exciting too.	Ema hã do dzidzɔ na ame.
He is in the car.	Ele ʋua me.
Let me know what you think!.	Na manya nusi nèsusu!.
This project is a lot to do myself.	Dɔ sia nye nu geɖe si nye ŋutɔ mawɔ.
I came here for this.	Meva afisia ɖe esia ta.
I think these people are going in the wrong direction.	Mesusu be ame siawo le mɔ gbegblẽ dzi yim.

Be grateful for what you have.	Da akpe ɖe nu siwo le asiwò ta.
Look at what you did last time.	Kpɔ nusi nèwɔ zi mamlɛtɔ ɖa.

A chorus of angry voices.	Gbe siwo do dziku ƒe ha aɖe ɖi.
You can’t understand it.	Màte ŋu ase egɔme o.

Make the thread into the thread.	Wɔ ka la ɖe ka la me.

It’s first hand.	Enye asi gbãtɔ.
I will stay here.	Manɔ afisia.
You can have any name you want.	Ŋkɔ ɖesiaɖe si nèdi la ate ŋu anɔ asiwò.
A swarm of angry bees landed on his head.	Anyi siwo do dziku ƒe ha aɖe ɖi ɖe eƒe ta dzi.

This is the opposite of what you want.	Esia to vovo na nusi dim nèle.
It’s probably because he’s not really here.	Anye esi mele afisia ŋutɔŋutɔ o tae.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ema menye nu gbegblẽ o.
Anyone could have got them.	Amesiame ate ŋu axɔ wo hafi.

And he was there, too.	Eye eya hã nɔ afima.

Nothing seemed to bother the dog.	Edze abe naneke meɖe fu na avu la o ene.
Actually, it’s more complicated than that.	Le nyateƒe me la, eƒe sesẽ wu ema.
But he didn’t know how to finish the job.	Gake menya alesi wòawɔ awu dɔa nu o.
I didn’t want to talk to him either.	Nye hã nyemedi be maƒo nu kplii o.

He can see everything now.	Ate ŋu akpɔ nusianu fifia.
He seemed calm, peaceful.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme, eƒe dzi dze eme ene.
Use your head instead of your heart.	Zã wò ta ɖe wò dzi teƒe.
I'm going.	Ado go.
If that is mind you.	Ne ema nye susu me na wò.
I know you well enough.	Menya wò nyuie.
At some point, anyway.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I turned them off quickly.	Metsi wo kaba.
Look at that guy.	Kpɔ ŋutsu ma ɖa.
Life is harder.	Agbe sesẽ wu.
The house was badly damaged.	Aƒea gblẽ vevie.
I couldn’t answer.	Nyemete ŋu ɖo eŋu o.
He would probably do the same thing.	Anɔ eme be eya hã awɔ nu ma ke.
It was a difficult time in my life.	Enye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe le nye agbe me.
Release if necessary.	Ðe asi le eŋu ne ehiã.
And now he has it.	Eye fifia la, ele esi.
This is already amazing.	Esia wɔ nuku xoxo.
There are many things.	Nu geɖe li.
If in fact .	Ne le nyateƒe me la .
It is now only a matter of time.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye azɔ.
Or something more than that.	Alo nane si wu nenema.
Perhaps things are different.	Ðewohĩ nuwo to vovo.
Let’s try something a little more challenging.	Mina míate nane si sesẽ vie la kpɔ.
I know his mind, and he knows my voice.	Menya eƒe susu, eye eya hã nya nye gbe.
But we are not all the same.	Gake mí katã míenye ame ɖeka o.
He will make one for her.	Awɔ ɖeka nɛ.
That’s a very difficult role for anyone to play.	Ema nye akpa sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ na amesiame be wòawɔ.
I am not like that.	Nyemele nenema o.
I don’t think anyone would.	Nyemesusu be ame aɖeke awɔe nenema o.
A strong wind blew.	Ya sesẽ aɖe ƒo.
Drive the car carefully!	Ʋu ʋua nyuie!
I am not apologizing.	Menye ɖe mele kuku ɖem o.
Things are fine now.	Nuwo le nyuie fifia.
You now have two things.	Nu eve le asiwò fifia.
I wish there was more of that out there.	Ne ɖe ema dometɔ geɖe wu le afima la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
Take a look at them.	Lé ŋku ɖe wo ŋu.
It’s not a small thing.	Menye nu sue aɖe ko o.
This didn’t happen.	Esia mewɔe o.
He patted the dog on the head.	Etsɔ asi ƒo avu la ƒe ta.
I think every fight is a tough one.	Mesusu be avu ɖesiaɖe nye avu sesẽ aɖe.
In the extreme.	Le nusi gbɔ eme me.
I got a job.	Mekpɔ dɔ aɖe.
I gave him permission.	Meɖe mɔ nɛ.
It’s a reasonable idea.	Enye susu si me susu le.
I just can’t do it.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔe o.
Here things are a little different.	Le afisia la, nuwo to vovo vie.
They are sucking wind and water and have no car.	Wole ya kple tsi ƒom eye ʋu aɖeke mele wo si o.
I just tried now.	Ðeko medze agbagba fifia.
I listened carefully.	Meɖo to nyuie.
He never touched me that whole time.	Meka asi ŋunye ɣeyiɣi ma katã kpɔ o.
Everything else should stay where it belongs.	Ele be nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nanɔ afisi wòle.
Sign up for me.	De asi agbalẽ te nam.
I don’t know what’s in it.	Nyemenya nusi le eme o.
This definitely won’t do our way.	Esia mawɔ godoo le míaƒe mɔ dzi o.
It happened like this.	Edzɔ alea.
Start working now.	Dze dɔme fifia.
I could see everything.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nusianu.
This is very important.	Esia le vevie ŋutɔ.
He was a poor man.	Enye ame si mewɔa nu nyuie o.
They are here for you.	Wole afisia na wò.
I need more money.	Mehiã ga geɖe wu.
He never said a word.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke kpɔ o.
Perhaps you have a question.	Ðewohĩ nya aɖe le asiwò.
Ya la to the kaba.	Ya la ku kaba.
It doesn’t matter.	Mehiã o.
It makes more sense to me.	Susu le eme nam wu.
I will do you a favor.	Mawɔ nu nyui na wò.
I couldn’t control it.	Nyemete ŋu ɖu edzi o.
The whole teacher thing is wet.	Nufiala ƒe nu bliboa tsi.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
No one said much.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya geɖe o.
Don't know why this worked.	Mènya nusita esia wɔ dɔ o.
Much has been done to his reputation.	Nu geɖe gblẽ le eƒe ŋkɔ ŋu.
I reassured myself.	Meka ɖe edzi na ɖokuinye.
You are never alone.	Wò ɖeka koe menye gbeɖe o.
He could have done nothing at all.	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔ naneke kura hafi o.
There is no error now.	Vodada aɖeke meli fifia o.
The truth will come out.	Nyateƒea ado go.
I’m not quite sure.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi tututu o.
He won’t do anything.	Mawɔ naneke o.
Something about her character was amazing.	Nane si ku ɖe eƒe nɔnɔme ŋu la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Just tell me what you think.	Ðeko nàgblɔ nusi nèsusu nam.
You can’t control it.	Màte ŋu akpɔ edzi o.
That was never the issue.	Ema menye nya la gbeɖe o.
Nothing interested me before that.	Naneke metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam do ŋgɔ na ema o.
Only one person would have understood.	Ame ɖeka koe ase egɔme hafi.
But this is only one of the possible pitfalls.	Gake mɔ̃ siwo ate ŋu anɔ anyi la dometɔ ɖeka koe esia nye.
We were very excited about it.	Dzi dzɔ mí ŋutɔ ɖe eŋu.
The first one was simple.	Gbãtɔ nɔ bɔbɔe.
That, is your current situation.	Ema, enye wò nɔnɔme si me nèle fifia.
I don’t want to work anywhere else.	Nyemedi be mawɔ dɔ le teƒe bubu aɖeke o.
I had never heard of these new rules.	Nyemese se yeye siawo ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
But that is not the problem in the case before us.	Gake menye emae nye kuxi si le nya si le mía ŋgɔ me o.
That is not true at all.	Ema menye nyateƒe kura o.
There are some things that need to be done.	Nu aɖewo li siwo wòle be woawɔ.
I could start smoking in my mouth.	Mete ŋu te dzudzɔ le nye nu me.
But not in a good way.	Gake menye le mɔ nyui aɖe nu o.
I seem to like it.	Edze abe nye nu dzɔa dzi nam ene.
This isn’t surprising.	Esia mewɔ nuku o.
It could be a system.	Ate ŋu anye ɖoɖo aɖe.
Some of them will never be.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
Or better yet, for that matter.	Alo esi nyo wu la, le nya ma ta.
But there is only one.	Gake ɖeka koe.
I have never seen this before.	Nyemekpɔ esia kpɔ o.
I know I’m not always going to do the same thing.	Menya be menye nu ɖeka ma ke wɔ ge ɣesiaɣi o.
They are doing this too.	Wole esia hã wɔm.
Thanks, that’s good for you.	Akpe, esia nyo na wò.
I have no idea what this is about.	Nyemenya nusi ŋu nya sia ku ɖo o.
If you die.	Se wo ku.
I couldn’t stop it.	Nyemete ŋu tɔ te o.
He had no idea.	Susu aɖeke menɔ esi o.
Nothing has ever worked.	Naneke mewɔ dɔ kpɔ o.
It could be that we can figure something out.	Ate ŋu anye be míate ŋu akpɔ nane gbɔ.
He has to do this or he does nothing.	Ele be wòawɔ esia alo mewɔa naneke o.
That is the reality.	Emae nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I was really worried.	Metsi dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I can’t contribute one way or another.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ akpa aɖe le mɔ aɖe nu o.
There is plenty of time!.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe li!.
You have the time.	Ɣeyiɣi le asiwò.
Clearly, it is.	Edze ƒã be ele nenema.
It is ultimately who we are.	Enye amesi míenye mlɔeba.
But he is no longer there.	Gake megale afima o.
Nothing was the same as before.	Naneke menɔ abe alesi wònɔ tsã ene o.
I can’t live without her.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe eya manɔmee o.
For some reason.	Le susu aɖewo ta.
I really need this post today.	Me hiã nya sia ŋutɔ egbea.
We can see several possible reasons for this.	Míate ŋu akpɔ susu geɖe siwo ate ŋu anɔ esia ta.
We can’t do it here.	Míate ŋu awɔe le afisia o.
But, look at the bright side.	Gake, kpɔ akpa si me kɔ la ɖa.
I couldn’t sit through it.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ anyi to eme o.
No one can prove anything.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu aɖo kpe naneke dzi o.
I know you are a good person.	Menya be ame nyui aɖee nènye.
I’m not quite sure.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi tututu o.
I'll go now.	Mayi azɔ.
He didn’t trust any of them.	Meka ɖe wo dometɔ aɖeke dzi o.
He was not in good shape.	Menɔ nɔnɔme nyui me o.
It’s impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi.
Those who knew them were interested.	Ame siwo nya wo la tsɔ ɖe le eme.
He will go with you.	Ayi kpli wò.
Its so simple.	Eƒe bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
He is ready to work.	Ele klalo be yeawɔ dɔ.
But it’s only temporary.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖe koe.
It's just bothering him.	Ðeko wòle fu ɖem na ye.
I turned out to be right.	Meva dzɔ be nye nya le eteƒe.
The work was getting bigger.	Dɔa nɔ gã dom ɖe edzi.
And none is necessary.	Eye ɖeke mehiã o.
He was a very nice guy.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I am in a very bad place.	Mele teƒe gbegblẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
But we can do it.	Gake míate ŋui.
I don’t have any right now.	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke fifia o.
His mind told him that.	Eƒe susu gblɔ nya ma nɛ.
There is a cat-and-dog situation.	Nɔnɔme aɖe le avu kple avu dome.
But only in name.	Gake ŋkɔ me koe.
In fact, the opposite is true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae.
This didn’t work out too well.	Esia mewɔ dɔ nyuie akpa o.
There was another problem.	Kuxi bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
Not in this room, at this time, in this place.	Menye le xɔ sia me o, le ɣeyiɣi sia me, le teƒe sia o.
It happened so quickly.	Edzɔ kaba ale gbegbe.
I’ve seen just about everything work.	Mekpɔ nusianu kloe le dɔ wɔm.
Thousands of years have passed.	Ƒe akpe geɖe va yi.
I need the right attitude.	Mehiã na nɔnɔme si sɔ.
I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
In the end, everyone worked very well together.	Mlɔeba la, amesiame wɔ dɔ ɖekae nyuie ŋutɔ.
You told us what to do.	Wòe gblɔ nu si míawɔ la na mí.
We have anything and everything.	Nusianu kple nusianu le mía si.
This is actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Now, let’s fight together.	Azɔ, mina míawɔ avu ɖekae.
He didn’t remember any of them.	Meɖo ŋku wo dometɔ aɖeke dzi o.
Maybe that was running through his mind.	Ðewohĩ emae nɔ du dzi le eƒe susu me.
Something that didn’t look right.	Nane si medze nyuie o.
That was the first thing that surprised him.	Emae nye nu gbãtɔ si wɔ nuku nɛ.
I ask a guy.	Mebiaa ŋutsu aɖe be.
This is something we really need to work on.	Esia nye nusi ŋu wòle be míawɔ dɔ le ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He couldn’t see anything.	Mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
And now we have a lot to do.	Eye fifia nu geɖe le mía si míawɔ.
We have two parts in .	Akpa eve le mía si le .
I was both surprised and unsurprised.	Ewɔ nuku nam eye mewɔ nuku nam hã o.
I was comfortable in my room.	Nye dzi dze eme le nye xɔ me.
That’s what happened.	Emae nye nusi dzɔ.
More of the same thing.	Nu ma ke geɖe wu.
For many reasons, the night would be better for him.	Le susu geɖe ta la, zã la anyo nɛ wu.
I would rather be here.	Anyo nam wu be manɔ afisia.
We have help available.	Kpekpeɖeŋu le mía si.
Who is there? 	Amekae le afima?
The project had been in progress for some time.	Dɔa nɔ edzi yim ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
Anyone who is against us.	Ame sia ame si tsi tre ɖe mía nu.
There is no room for error.	Vodada ƒe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke meli o.
It feels like a part of me died today.	Ewɔ nam abe nye akpa aɖe ku egbea ene.
You don’t know enough about you.	Mènya nu tso ŋuwò nyuie o.
It’s my time!	Nye ɣeyiɣi!
It’s always been great.	Enye gã ɣesiaɣi.
It is a lot of things.	Enye nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
Now get out of here.	Azɔ do go.
What to do about them.	Nusi woawɔ tso wo ŋu.
The king would have none of it.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke manɔ fia la si o.
I am something different.	Menye nane si to vovo.
Everyone is different.	Ame sia ame to vovo.
I think you know.	Mesusu be ènya.
And a dog of his own.	Eye avu aɖe si nye eya ŋutɔ tɔ.
You really don’t have to do that yourself.	Le nyateƒe me la, mehiã be wò ŋutɔ nàwɔ ema o.
OH.	O.
Death is a part of life.	Ku nye agbe ƒe akpa aɖe.
They always have something for you to do!	Nane le wo si ɣesiaɣi na wò be nàwɔ!
Not sure what came out.	Meka ɖe nusi do go dzi o.
I don’t have to be this way and I shouldn’t be.	Mehiã be manɔ alea o eye mele be manɔ nenema hã o.
This is really, really obvious!	Esia dze ƒã ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ!
There were many reasons.	Susu geɖe nɔ anyi siwo tae.
I think he should do that a little bit.	Mesusu be ele be wòawɔ ema vie.
It doesn’t seem like a big deal to me.	Medze nam abe nu gã aɖeke ene o.
They’re there.	Wole afima.
If anyone knows, please help me with that.	Ne ame aɖe nya la, taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye le ema ŋu.
Everything is going wrong.	Nusianu le edzi yim nyuie o.
You have a problem.	Kuxi aɖe le ŋuwò.
I don’t know what happened to him.	Nyemenya nu si dzɔ ɖe edzi o.
One week at a time.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka ɖeka.
He can do anything.	Ate ŋu awɔ nusianu.
I am so happy with them!.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ɖe wo ŋu!.
I have to be nice about this kind of thing.	Ele be mawɔ nu nyuie le nu sia ƒomevi ŋu.

But just a personal preference.	Gake ame ŋutɔ ƒe didi aɖe koe.
I have something to tell you.	Nya aɖe le asinye magblɔ na mi.
It’s there but it’s not there.	Ele afima gake mele afima o.
My passion for it is different.	Nye didi vevie ɖe eŋu to vovo.
I know you have at least two.	Menya be eve ya teti le asiwò.
It was so extreme.	Enye nusi gbɔ eme ale gbegbe.
No wet clothes.	Awu si me tsi le aɖeke meli o.
There were no problems of any kind.	Kuxi ƒomevi aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
None of them did that.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
And they will act quickly.	Eye woawɔ nu kaba.
That’s what we’re going to do.	Emae nye nusi míawɔ.
Maybe someone left some food.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe gblẽ nuɖuɖu aɖewo ɖi.
Be a part of it.	Nye akpa aɖe.
This is something you should never do.	Esia nye nusi mele be nàwɔ gbeɖe o.
Maybe this will help you.	Ðewohĩ esia akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
There are some drawbacks to this book.	Nu aɖewo gblẽ le agbalẽ sia ŋu.
But he didn’t plan it well.	Gake mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu nyuie o.
It can be here.	Ate ŋu anɔ afisia.
This made a big impression on the house.	Esia wɔ dɔ ɖe aƒe dzi ŋutɔ.
No one will bother him.	Ame aɖeke maɖe fu nɛ o.
So far this year he has four.	Vaseɖe fifia le ƒe sia me la, ene le esi.
I want to be in the here and now.	Medi be manɔ afisia kple fifia la me.
No one can be you better than you.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu anye wò nyuie wu wò o.
There were only a few roads.	Mɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ afima.
I don’t want to talk to anyone at this point.	Nyemedi be maƒo nu kple ame aɖeke le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
Please respond with respect.	Taflatse ɖo eŋu kple bubu.
I was very interested in it.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme vevie.
He tried again and again.	Edze agbagba zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
Many of them have been there for the past four years.	Wo dometɔ geɖe nɔ afima ƒe ene enye sia.
But there is no one there.	Gake ame aɖeke mele afima o.
Many of them don’t have a voice.	Gbe mele wo dometɔ geɖe si o.
Go back to work.	Trɔ yi dɔme.
That’s a long way to go.	Ema nye mɔ didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
A little goes a long way.	Vi aɖe koe wɔa nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
He enjoyed the novelty.	Nu yeye si wònye la do dzidzɔ nɛ ŋutɔ.
A man nearby threw himself to one side.	Ŋutsu aɖe si te ɖe afima ŋu tsɔ eɖokui ƒu gbe ɖe akpa ɖeka.
Everything he did was like that.	Nu sia nu si wòwɔ la nɔ nenema.
You can’t be doing that.	Màte ŋu anɔ ema wɔm o.

Not likely, but possible.	Menye nusi anya dzɔ o, gake anya wɔ.

You can do the same thing here.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu ma ke le afisia.
But he was a great guy.	Gake enye ŋutsu gã aɖe.
Water is what matters.	Tsi ye le vevie.
This will take hours.	Esia axɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe.

Or he can do something.	Alo ate ŋu awɔ nane.
No one knows anything.	Ame aɖeke menya naneke o.
I don’t want to do this.	Nyemedi be mawɔ esia o.
I took that with me.	Metsɔ ema ɖe asi.
He didn’t expect it to be so easy.	Mekpɔ mɔ be anɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
More in the summer.	Nu geɖe wu le dzomeŋɔli.
He was deeply saddened by the news of his death.	Eƒe ku ƒe nya la te ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
But not often enough.	Gake menye zi geɖe o.
I actually like this idea.	Le nyateƒe me la, susu sia dzɔa dzi nam.
Everything is already covered.	Nusianu xɔ aƒe xoxo.
I knew they were there.	Menya be wole afima.
It’s not surprising.	Mewɔ nuku o.
The task was relatively simple.	Dɔa nɔ bɔbɔe vie.
Please let me know how we can be a part of this.	Taflatse na manya alesi míate ŋu anye esia ƒe akpa aɖe.
We can still handle this.	Míate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ kokoko.
If you like it, live it.	Ne edzɔ dzi na wò la, ke nɔ agbe ɖe enu.
He was a guy who had won in the past.	Enye ŋutsu aɖe si ɖu dzi va yi.

Now, that’s been a while.	Fifia, ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye ema.
A good child.	Vi nyui aɖe.
But there is a lot against me.	Gake nu geɖe li tsi tre ɖe ŋunye.
He will not do that	Mawɔe nenema o .
He couldn't remember anything that happened.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku naneke si dzɔ la dzi o.
It is life or death.	Enye agbe alo ku.
But he didn’t like it.	Gake eƒe nu medze eŋu o.
Not if we can help it.	Menye ne míate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu o.
We just can’t do anything with it here.	Ðeko míate ŋu awɔ naneke kplii le afisia o.
Might as well not be so bad.	Ðewohĩ anyo nenema ke menye nu gbegblẽ nenema gbegbe o.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
But it wasn’t his last problem.	Gake menye eƒe kuxi mamlɛtɔ o.

It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
He will see for himself what is going on.	Eya ŋutɔ akpɔ nusi le edzi yim.
He was very, very sick.	Edze dɔ ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
And of course, he had a good reason.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, susu nyui aɖe nɔ esi.
I hope it works.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ.
But he never did that.	Gake mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
This ended without difficulty.	Esia wu enu sesẽ aɖeke manɔmee.

Help can reach them quickly.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ate ŋu aɖo wo gbɔ kaba.

But this time, he wasn’t alone.	Gake fifia ya, menye eya ɖeka koe o.

I looked into his one good eye.	Mekpɔ eƒe ŋku nyui ɖeka la me.

You are on my mind every moment of my life.	Èle nye susu me le nye agbe ƒe ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe me.
He didn’t expect that.	Mekpɔ mɔ nenema o.
Same thing with that.	Nu ma ke le ema hã ŋu.
A book will usually have a lot of content, and a lot of work.	Zi geɖe la, nya geɖe anɔ agbalẽ aɖe me, eye woawɔ dɔ geɖe.
Give us a name.	Na míaƒe ŋkɔ.
This fortress disappeared in course of time.	Mɔ̃ sesẽ sia bu le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe.
Plan to say two hours.	Wɔ ɖoɖo nàgblɔ be gaƒoƒo eve.
And a little for myself.	Eye vi aɖe na nye ŋutɔ hã.
He didn’t see anyone for weeks at a time.	Mekpɔ ame aɖeke kwasiɖa geɖe le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me o.
You know what it’s like.	Ènya alesi wòle.
You know you can do it.	Ènya be yeate ŋui.
I am not like that.	Nyemele nenema o.
The air was clear and the wind blew in our faces.	Ya me kɔ eye ya ƒo míaƒe mo.
I wanted to do it for myself.	Medi be mawɔe na ɖokuinye.
Spend time with it.	Zã ɣeyiɣi ɖe eŋu.
So much for that, the whole food thing.	Ale gbegbe ɖe ema ta, nuɖuɖu ƒe nu bliboa.
This went on for far too long.	Esia yi edzi ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
Waste of money there.	Ga gbegblẽ le afima.
I can’t tell you when.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ ɣekaɣie wòawɔ na wò o.
I definitely saw them.	Mekpɔ wo godoo.
Someone according to my own heart.	Ame aɖe le nye ŋutɔ nye dzi nu.
But he had something else in mind.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ susu me nɛ.
It’s a great final chapter.	Enye ta mamlɛtɔ gã aɖe.
It started with my mind.	Edze egɔme tso nye susu dzi.
Ava.	Ava.
It started out as a crazy idea.	Edze egɔme abe susu si me susu mele o ene.
That much is obvious now.	Nu ma gbegbe dze ƒã fifia.
He was really very interested in this.	Etsɔ ɖe le nya sia me vevie nyateƒe.
We can help!.	Míate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu!.
People demanded something be done.	Amewo bia be woawɔ nane.
This is not true at all.	Esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
This is just between you and me.	Esia le mía kpli wò dome ko.
About you, about me.	Le ŋuwò, le ŋunye.
There is nothing to do.	Naneke meli woawɔ o.
Clearly, this is good news.	Edze ƒã be nya nyui aɖee esia nye.
I missed that.	Ema to ŋunye.
What do you think was going on?	Nukae nèsusu be nɔ edzi yim?
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
You can’t draw any conclusions.	Màte ŋu aƒo nya ta aɖeke o.
Maybe it’s you.	Ðewohĩ wòe.
He had never been able to see in my mind.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nu le nye susu me kpɔ o.
Not surprisingly, that didn’t last long.	Mewɔ nuku o be ema menɔ anyi didi o.
All day long.	Ŋkeke bliboa katã.
That can be a problem.	Ema ate ŋu anye kuxi.
They are throwing a rock.	Wole kpe aɖe ƒom.
And you	Eye wò .
Home for a few years.	Aƒeme ƒe ʋɛ aɖewo.
The whole person changed.	Ame bliboa trɔ.
Write down the relevant words.	Ŋlɔ nya siwo sɔ kple nya la ɖi.
This situation is bad.	Nɔnɔme sia gblẽ.
In one sense, this is real.	Le mɔ ɖeka nu la, esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This dress is new.	Awu sia nye nu yeye.
You have to have the element of surprise.	Ele be nusi wɔa nuku na ame la nanɔ asiwò.
I am not sure how to do this.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi mawɔ esia dzi o.
You did tell me that.	Ègblɔ nya ma nam nyateƒe.
There was no one, just something.	Ame aɖeke menɔ anyi o, nu aɖe koe nɔ anyi.
I have to speak up.	Ele be maƒo nu.
I was against it in every way.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu le mɔ ɖesiaɖe nu.
Everything started out rather well.	Nusianu dze egɔme nyuie vie.
All of these things work well.	Nu siawo katã wɔa dɔ nyuie.
This time will soon come.	Ɣeyiɣi sia ava ɖo kpuie.
So is everyone else.	Nenema ke ame sia ame hã le.
There are often people there.	Amewo nɔa afima zi geɖe.
Water, of course, is essential to life.	Tsi le vevie na agbe ya.
It was a great place to do the job.	Enye teƒe nyui aɖe si woawɔ dɔa le.
Everyone looked up.	Amesiame fɔ mo dzi.
He didn’t mind doing this.	Meɖe fu nɛ be wòawɔ esia o.
Find what works for you.	Di nusi awɔ dɔ na wò.
He had his back to me.	Eƒe megbe nɔ ŋunye.
He obviously didn’t, for two reasons.	Edze ƒã be mewɔe nenema o, le susu eve ta.
Now hurry up!	Azɔ wɔ kaba!
But this is a really big deal.	Gake esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t know if this is viable.	Nyemenya nenye be esia ate ŋu awɔ dɔ o.
Surprisingly, he couldn’t remember what it was.	Ewɔ nuku be mete ŋu ɖo ŋku nusi wònye dzi o.
But this year is different.	Gake ƒe sia to vovo.
The house is an old building.	Aƒea nye xɔ xoxo aɖe.
He will not be alone.	Manɔ anyi eya ɖeka o.
Emphasize the positive aspects.	Te gbe ɖe nu nyui siwo le eme dzi.
No words came to mind.	Nya aɖeke meva susu me nam o.
Everything else seemed unimportant.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe dze abe ɖe mele vevie o ene.
But that’s a problem for another day.	Gake ema nye kuxi na ŋkeke bubu.
Everyone has to live with this new reality.	Ele be amesiame nanɔ agbe kple nu ŋutɔŋutɔ yeye sia.
I could clearly see everything in my head.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu ɖesiaɖe si le nye ta me nyuie.
I just want you.	Ðeko medi be wò.
The issue is there.	Nya la le afima.
More than one person.	Ame siwo wu ɖeka.
It was that all the way.	Enye ema le mɔ bliboa dzi.
These issues are important.	Nya siawo le vevie.
It may take about a day or two.	Ate ŋu axɔ abe ŋkeke alo eve ene.
Because of the water.	Le tsi la ta.
Take another step forward.	Ðe afɔ bubu yi ŋgɔ.
In about a month.	Le abe ɣleti ɖeka ene me.
Still, it’s not surprising at all.	Ke hã, mewɔ nuku kura o.
How did you get to work this morning?	Aleke nèwɔ va ɖo dɔme ŋdi sia?
But there is no string.	Gake ka aɖeke meli o.
It felt like one to me.	Ewɔ nam abe ɖeka ene.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
It can take weeks.	Ate ŋu axɔ kwasiɖa geɖe.
But we’re going to lose it.	Gake míele eŋu bu ge.
But it doesn’t matter.	Gake mehiã o.
This person talks a lot.	Ame sia ƒoa nu zi geɖe.
Everyone is going to hate me.	Ame sia ame le fu lé ge nam.
I used to do that.	Tsã la, mewɔa nu ma.
Maybe there’s something to that idea.	Ðewohĩ nane le susu ma ŋu.
And that will likely take years.	Eye anɔ eme be ema axɔ ƒe geɖe.
Check out what he’s doing.	Kpɔ nusi wɔm wòle ɖa.
It can’t be finished.	Mate ŋu awu enu o.
What happened, happened.	Nusi dzɔ, dzɔ.
Everything else is great.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nyo ŋutɔ.
It could be anything.	Ate ŋu anye nusianu.
I have some good news for you.	Nya nyui aɖewo le asinye na wò.
But this is more complicated.	Gake nya sia sesẽ wu.
Have had no problems so far.	Mekpɔ kuxi aɖeke vaseɖe fifia o.
I just have to be here.	Ðeko wòle be manɔ afisia.
Nothing seemed to matter.	Edze abe naneke mele vevie o ene.
It doesn’t seem to work.	Edze abe mewɔa dɔ o ene.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Gake naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu o.
I didn’t have to stay.	Mehiã be manɔ anyi o.
It didn’t do any work.	Mewɔ dɔ aɖeke o.
That much is clear to me.	Nu ma gbegbe me kɔ nam.
I am the same way.	Nye hã mele nenema ke.
I expected this.	Mekpɔ mɔ na esia.
People really need this.	Amewo hiã esia ŋutɔŋutɔ.
No one knows what will happen tomorrow, ever.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi ava dzɔ etsɔ o, gbeɖe o.
Now is as good a time as any.	Fifia nye ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe abe ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe ene.
This worked well before, but now it doesn’t.	Esia wɔ dɔ nyuie tsã, gake fifia ya mewɔa dɔ nyuie o.
That is not true.	Ema menye nyateƒe o.
I want to be real with you.	Medi be mawɔ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ kpli wò.
I am that guy.	Nyee nye ŋutsu ma.
Make your own time.	Wɔ wò ŋutɔ wò ɣeyiɣi.
I was kind of worried about it.	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu le mɔ aɖe nu.
And joy is contagious.	Eye dzidzɔ xɔa ame me.
I want to know what’s going on here.	Medi be manya nusi le edzi yim le afisia.
And that’s something.	Eye ema nye nane.
It’s up to you.	Wòe le asiwò.
Start somewhere else.	Dze egɔme tso teƒe bubu.
I know that’s why.	Menya be ema tae.
Your time is short.	Wò ɣeyiɣi le kpuie.
He couldn’t understand why it didn’t work out.	Mete ŋu se nusita mewɔ dɔ nyuie o gɔme o.
The work is in progress.	Dɔa le edzi yim.
Go back to work.	Trɔ yi dɔme.
My good eye was never very good.	Nye ŋku nyui la me nyo ŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
But there was still money there.	Gake ga gakpɔtɔ nɔ afima.
Which would have been a bad thing.	Nusi anye nu gbegblẽ hafi.
I am still there.	Megale afima kokoko.
I’m interested in you.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò.
Every talking head is the same.	Ta ɖesiaɖe si le nu ƒom la le ɖeka.
This situation cannot continue.	Nɔnɔme sia mate ŋu ayi edzi o.
It has to work.	Ele be wòawɔ dɔ.
Two things can happen from here.	Nu eve ate ŋu adzɔ tso afisia.
Everything was dirty and dusty.	Nusianu xɔ ɖi kple ke.
This went on for a very long time.	Esia yi edzi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
They obviously didn’t have time.	Edze ƒã be ɣeyiɣi menɔ wo si o.
As is the case here.	Abe alesi wòle le afisia ene.
Everything else works.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe wɔa dɔ.
He wasn’t going to tell me anything.	Menye nya aɖeke gblɔ ge nam o.
And he needs some help.	Eye ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo.
This is something he has to do on his own.	Esia nye nusi wòle be wòawɔ le eɖokui si.
We can’t have that.	Ema mate ŋu anɔ mía si o.
I was too old.	Metsi akpa.
Both old and new will be here.	Xoxo kple yeye siaa anɔ afisia.
It’s a very interesting thing.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
He had never been so close.	Mete ɖe eŋu alea gbegbe kpɔ o.
This is too important.	Esia le vevie akpa.
Yet there is no one.	Ke hã ame aɖeke meli o.
He doesn’t need any.	Mehiã ɖeke o.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I'm sure he has more plans for me.	Meka ɖe edzi be ɖoɖo geɖe wu le esi nam.
Our little house.	Míaƒe aƒe sue la.
Stick to strategies that work.	Lé aɖaŋu siwo wɔa dɔ la me ɖe asi.
There was a lot of space.	Teƒe geɖe nɔ afima.
Everyone dresses well.	Amesiame doa awu nyuie.
I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong.	Nyemeka ɖe nu gbegblẽ si wɔm mele dzi o.
But he didn’t understand.	Gake mese egɔme o.
This will provide more stable support.	Esia ana kpekpeɖeŋu si li ke wu.
But not often enough.	Gake menye zi geɖe o.
Everyone was angry.	Amesiame do dziku.
They’re going on all the time.	Wole edzi yim ɣesiaɣi.
Death was too soon.	Ku nɔ kaba akpa.
But that might be nice.	Gake ɖewohĩ ema anyo ŋutɔ.
You are more manly than he is.	Ènye ŋutsu wu eya.
Someone might be mad at me.	Ame aɖe ate ŋu ado dziku ɖe ŋunye.
It would have been very different.	Anye ne eƒe nɔnɔme to vovo kura hafi.
I felt very strongly about it.	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ŋutɔ.
For the little one.	Na ɖevi sue la.
But again, this didn’t help.	Gake le afisia hã la, esia meɖe vi aɖeke o.
This should come as no surprise to anyone.	Mele be esia nawɔ nuku na ame aɖeke o.
It didn’t surprise anyone.	Mewɔ nuku na ame aɖeke o.
We’ve been here too long.	Míele afisia ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
He deserves it though.	Edze nɛ gake.
But maybe that’s a good thing.	Gake ɖewohĩ nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
It’s just that we’re too busy.	Ðeko wòle be vovo mele mía ŋu akpa o.
I want what is real.	Medi nusi le ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I will talk to some people.	Maƒo nu kple ame aɖewo.
None of them are like that.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele nenema o.
Seems like a normal situation.	Edze abe nɔnɔme si sɔ ene.
But it will turn out well.	Gake ava dzɔ nyuie.
I had a few projects to do.	Dɔ ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ asinye mawɔ.
Thank you for the great work.	Akpe na mi ɖe dɔ gã la ta.
But he can try.	Gake ate ŋu ate kpɔ.
I was a little worried.	Metsi dzi vie.
That’s pretty much everyone.	Ema nye amesiame kloe.
The necessary conditions remain.	Nɔnɔme siwo hiã la gakpɔtɔ li.
I was both angry and worried about it.	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu eye metsi dzi ɖe eŋu siaa.
He gave her his name.	Etsɔ eƒe ŋkɔ nɛ.
Say thank you.	Gblɔ be akpe na wò.
He didn’t care at all, of course.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme kura o ya.
Help me find them.	Kpe ɖe ŋunye makpɔ wo.
I don’t want to be anywhere, to be honest.	Nyemedi be manɔ afi aɖeke o, be magblɔ nyateƒea.
I really enjoy this.	Esia dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Otherwise, everyone will have to make their own.	Ne menye nenema o la, ahiã be amesiame nawɔ eya ŋutɔ tɔ.
I will tell them what we are.	Magblɔ nusi míenye na wo.
I couldn’t see who it was, but there was someone there.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ amesi wònye o, gake ame aɖe nɔ afima.
He wasn't expecting that.	Menye ɖe wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na ema o.
I made a mistake before.	Mewɔ vodada tsã.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe aɖe akpe ɖe ame ŋu ŋutɔ.
Look, if you’re going to do this, do it right.	Kpɔ ɖa, ne èle esia wɔ ge la, wɔe nyuie.
And that’s a problem.	Eye esia nye kuxi.
I would love that.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be ema.

I am in a state of panic.	Mele nɔnɔme si me metsi dzodzodzoe le me.

He did a great job.	Ewɔ dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
That’s just a good idea.	Susu nyui koe nye ema.

It was a solid fit for my dog.	Enye nusi sɔ ɖe nye avu ŋu sesĩe.
There was nothing like that.	Naneke menɔ anyi nenema o.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
He didn't seem to feel anything.	Edze abe naneke mese le eɖokui me o ene.
He would never do it.	Mawɔe gbeɖe o.
This would explain a lot.	Esia aɖe nu geɖe me.
I gave you what you wanted.	Metsɔ nu si nèdi la na wò.
Everyone in the meeting was impressed by his seriousness.	Eƒe susu vevie la wɔ dɔ ɖe amesiame dzi le kpekpea me.
A lot of things.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
This part didn’t sit well with me at all.	Akpa sia menɔ anyi nam nyuie kura o.
There is no issue of any kind.	Nya aɖeke ƒomevi aɖeke meli o.
It can never work.	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ gbeɖe o.
She had only one child.	Vi ɖeka koe nɔ esi.
I didn’t see them in this car.	Nyemekpɔ wo le ʋu sia me o.
He looked very tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ŋutɔ ene.
That’s my real problem.	Emae nye nye kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is certainly true.	Esia nye nyateƒe godoo.
I wanted that so badly for him.	Medi ema vevie nɛ vevie.
Please help me with this.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye le esia me.
Will get there tonight.	Aɖo afima le zã sia me.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
We do have a problem.	Kuxi aɖe le mía ŋu nyateƒe.
It’s a pretty big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Everyone is happy.	Amesiame kpɔa dzidzɔ.
This is a fact of life.	Nya sia nye nyateƒe.
He is not a good person.	Menye ame nyui o.
Use the shape of the object.	Zã nu ƒe nɔnɔme.
I don’t know who did it.	Nyemenya amesi wɔe o.
The law protects these documents.	Se la kpɔa agbalẽ siawo ta.
That’s right.	Ema sɔ.
I made him a little book.	Mewɔ agbalẽ sue aɖe nɛ.
I'm kind of in between things.	Mele nuwo dome ƒomevi aɖe.
There are no lies here.	Alakpa aɖeke mele afisia o.
It is something else.	Nu bubu aɖee wònye.
You can rely on it.	Àte ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe eŋu.
He seemed to have character.	Edze abe nɔnɔme nɔ esi ene.
The word felt strange in my mouth.	Nya la se le ɖokuinye me be ewɔ nuku le nye nu me.
He seemed interested in this.	Edze abe etsɔ ɖe le nya sia me ene.
We don’t know why.	Míenya nusi tae o.
This house is beautiful.	Aƒe sia nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
Time will overcome his anger.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖu eƒe dziku dzi.
I found something to do now.	Mekpɔ nane si mawɔ azɔ.
Which makes sense, actually.	Nusi me susu le, le nyateƒe me.
Add what you like and make a new book about it.	Tsɔ nusi dze ŋuwò kpe ɖe eŋu eye nàwɔ agbalẽ yeye tso eŋu.
Maybe I'll find out through that.	Ðewohĩ mava nya to ema dzi.
There was something about him.	Nane nɔ eŋu.
Be sure of that.	Ka ɖe edzi le nya ma ŋu.
This will surprise you.	Esia awɔ nuku na wò.
But think about it.	Gake bu eŋu kpɔ.
No building was in such bad shape.	Xɔ aɖeke menɔ nɔnɔme gbegblẽ me alea o.
If not, ask someone around you.	Ne menye nenema o la, bia ame aɖe si dome nèle.
What you are doing matters.	Nusi wɔm nèle la le vevie.
Eat all you want.	Ƒo nu siwo katã nèdi.
This can go on for days.	Esia ate ŋu ayi edzi ŋkeke geɖe.
I think there is a mistake.	Mesusu be vodada aɖe li.
Something in me couldn’t wait.	Nane si nɔ menye la mete ŋu nɔ lalam o.
Everything about it was, really.	Nusianu si ku ɖe eŋu la nɔ, le nyateƒe me.
It could be you or me.	Ate ŋu anye wò alo nye.
I wasn’t happy in my own life.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ le nye ŋutɔ nye agbe me o.
Which is very likely.	Nusi anya li ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Once in a while.	Zi ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi aɖewo me.
There may be, of course.	Ðewohĩ anɔ anyi ya.
I can never really find it.	Nyemate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
Please someone point the way.	Taflatse ame aɖe fia mɔ.
It’s happened before.	Edzɔ kpɔ.
This week has been a tough one.	Kwasiɖa sia nye kwasiɖa sesẽ aɖe.
I can’t do anything else.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
You had the gun.	Tu la nɔ asiwò.

So are the people	Amewo hã le nenema
And the most beautiful.	Eye esi nya kpɔ wu.
We are enjoying ourselves.	Míele dzidzɔ kpɔm.
Which is a bad thing.	Nusi nye nu gbegblẽ.
Dust collects everything.	Ke ƒoa nusianu nu ƒu.
He didn’t take sides.	Meɖe akpa aɖeke dzi o.
But he can handle that.	Gake ate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ.
None of them were useful.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meɖe vi aɖeke o.
Yet it is not working.	Ke hã mele dɔ wɔm o.
We will join them.	Míawɔ ɖeka kpli wo.
Perhaps there is another reason.	Ðewohĩ susu bubu aɖe hã li.
It needs to be worked on.	Ehiã be woawɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
It was a moment.	Enye ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
He didn’t see any of them.	Mekpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
But trust me, the end result is totally worth it.	Gake ka ɖe dzinye, nusi ado tso eme mlɔeba la ɖe vi kura.
His successors followed suit.	Ame siwo va xɔ ɖe eteƒe la hã wɔ ɖe edzi.
People are not working anymore.	Amewo megale dɔ wɔm o.
I was really more home-centered.	Nye susu nɔ aƒe ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ wu.
I want to stay on this same path.	Medi be manɔ mɔ sia ke dzi.
But there was something else in that fire.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ dzo ma me.
But and because of this.	Gake eye le esia ta.
This is the opposite of that.	Esia to vovo na ema.
As such, there was no reality.	Esi wòle alea ta la, nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Few people escaped.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe si.
But I can tell you this.	Gake mate ŋu agblɔ nya sia na wò.
I reached my tired feet.	Meɖo nye afɔ siwo ŋu ɖeɖi te ŋu.
He acted quickly.	Ewɔ nu kaba.
I have heard this before.	Mese nya sia do ŋgɔ.
There was general rejection.	Gbegbe le amewo katã dome nɔ anyi.
That day would be his death.	Gbe ma anye eƒe ku.
It is a mistake to act quickly.	Enye vodada be woawɔ nu kaba.
It won’t be easy.	Manɔ bɔbɔe o.
There is no room for you here.	Teƒe aɖeke meli na wò le afisia o.
I fell into a hole.	Medze anyi ɖe do aɖe me.

There is a lot to do.	Nu geɖe li woawɔ.
A dress, people.	Awu aɖe, amewo.
No popular support.	Ame geɖe ƒe kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke meli o.
Not just one shot.	Menye tu ɖeka ko o.
It has never been like that.	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o.
He hadn’t reached out.	Medo asi ɖa hafi o.
I have been in many of them.	Menɔ wo dometɔ geɖe me kpɔ.
Not one that anyone could find.	Menye ɖeke si ame aɖe ate ŋu akpɔ o.

We just don’t know when he was there.	Ðeko míenya ɣeyiɣi si me wònɔ afima o.
I would love to see you.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be makpɔ wò.
It seems too simple.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe akpa ene.
Something was obviously wrong with the car.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ le ʋua ŋu.

He didn’t care about food.	Nuɖuɖu metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ o.

Everything is frozen or wet.	Nusianu xɔ dzo alo xɔ dzo.
But something like this.	Gake nane si le abe esia ene.
Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Ðewohĩ mehiã o.
More than enough is enough.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ wu esi sɔ gbɔ.
No one seems convinced.	Edze abe ame aɖeke meka ɖe edzi o ene.
And after about a month, good news.	Eye le abe ɣleti ɖeka ene megbe la, nya nyui aɖee.
Continue at home.	Yi edzi le aƒeme.
It will be a very difficult task.	Anye dɔ sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
But it is no longer the case.	Gake megale nenema o.
I don’t know that.	Nyemenya nya ma o.
Some sort of years.	Ƒe aɖewo ƒomevi.
He has a great voice.	Gbe gã aɖe le esi.
The search went smoothly and quickly.	Didi la yi edzi nyuie eye wòwɔ kaba.
He doesn’t need that.	Mehiã ema o.
It will continue through next week.	Ayi edzi vaseɖe kwasiɖa si gbɔna me.
Look at his teacher.	Kpɔ eƒe nufiala ɖa.
It was, well, never necessary.	Enye, nyuie, mehiã gbeɖe o.
He had worked hard.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe kpɔ.
Quite something, in fact.	Nane ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
Very briefly here.	Kpuie ko le afisia.
But it is something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖee wònye.
I had nothing to say to any of them.	Nya aɖeke menɔ anyi nam be magblɔ na wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
Life is not that easy.	Agbe mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
Get in the car.	Ge ɖe ʋua me.
He had only one rule.	Se aɖe koe nɔ esi.
But this is far from the truth.	Gake esia mele nyateƒe si wònye kura o.
And he didn’t want any more.	Eye medi bubu aɖeke o.
The unemployed man entered the room.	Ŋutsu si mekpɔ dɔ awɔ o la ge ɖe xɔa me.
This is very difficult, but it is possible.	Esia sesẽ ŋutɔ, gake anya wɔ.
More and more people are living longer these days.	Ame geɖe wu le agbe didi wu le ŋkeke siawo me.
The result was not surprising at all.	Nusi do tso eme mewɔ nuku kura o.
I would have stayed there all night.	Anye ne manɔ afima zã bliboa katã.
They’re always there for me.	Wole afima ɣesiaɣi nam.
I am talking to myself.	Mele nu ƒom na ɖokuinye.
Its more than he can stand.	Eƒe nu geɖe wu alesi wòate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu.
There is no way.	Mɔ aɖeke meli o.
It can help you out.	Ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
Do it once and for all.	Wɔe zi ɖeka.
Now do it.	Azɔ wɔe.
We are not giving up.	Menye ɖe míele asi ɖem le eŋu o.
You have enough work for the whole year.	Dɔ si sɔ gbɔ le asiwò na ƒe bliboa.
Obviously, this is a difficult thing.	Edze ƒã be esia nye nu sesẽ aɖe.
Turn down in that direction.	Trɔ ɖe anyi le mɔ ma nu.
Many people came to enjoy it.	Ame geɖe va kpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu.
We have a job to do.	Dɔ le mía si míawɔ.
The snake was attaching itself to my leg.	Da la nɔ eɖokui ƒom ɖe nye afɔ ŋu.
This is quite different.	Esia to vovo kura.
In no way is it.	Le go aɖeke me o.
This may be the case in the near future.	Esia ate ŋu anɔ alea le etsɔ si gbɔna kpuie me.
I have to know.	Ele be manya.
Keep your head up, not down.	Na wò ta nanɔ dzi, ke menye ɖe anyi o.
He couldn't say anything.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nya aɖeke o.
In fact, it is, of course.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele nenema ya.
You know it doesn’t work that way.	Ènya be mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
It will be fine.	Anɔ nyuie.
He didn’t apply for work yesterday.	Metsɔ nya ɖe dɔ ŋu etsɔ o.
There was a lot he could have said.	Nya geɖe nɔ anyi si wòate ŋu agblɔ hafi.
No one understood anything that went on.	Ame aɖeke mese naneke si yi edzi gɔme o.
The one who won	Amesi ɖu dzi
But he was different, too.	Gake eya hã to vovo.
Tom was looking for a new job.	Tom nɔ dɔ yeye dim.
The first is legal.	Gbãtɔ nye esi ku ɖe se nu.
What is legal.	Nu si le se nu.
I don’t think it will though.	Nyemesusu be awɔe nenema o gake.
He will do the same now.	Awɔ nenema ke fifia.
He is the only one alive now.	Eya ɖeka koe le agbe fifia.
One other thing, too.	Nu bubu ɖeka hã.
This place is beautiful.	Teƒe sia nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
Mine went pretty well.	Nye tɔ yi edzi nyuie ŋutɔ.
My life has changed in such a positive way.	Nye agbe trɔ le nɔnɔme nyui aɖe me alea gbegbe.
No one believed him.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ edzi se o.
But you never know.	Gake mènya gbeɖe o.
I want to live longer.	Medi be manɔ agbe didi wu.
Other than that, it’s almost the same.	Ne menye nenema o la, nenema ke wòle kloe.
This seems quite strange.	Esia dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku kura ene.
One can feel it.	Ame ate ŋu ase le eɖokui me.
This isn’t one.	Esia menye ɖeka o.
I really don’t have to.	Le nyateƒe me la, mehiã be mawɔe o.
A fire severely damaged the building.	Dzo aɖe gblẽ nu le xɔa ŋu vevie.
But it could be the other way around.	Gake ate ŋu anye le mɔ bubu nu.
But there is a point to that.	Gake nya aɖe le ema ŋu.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
They probably had time.	Anɔ eme be ɣeyiɣi nɔ wo si.
Let me be happy.	Na makpɔ dzidzɔ.
My house is nearby.	Nye aƒe la te ɖe afima ŋu.
Someone asked me to share this.	Ame aɖe bia tso asinye be magblɔ nya sia na amewo.
You just need to tell me something about you.	Ðeko wòle be nàgblɔ nya aɖe nam tso ŋuwò.
We can’t get wet.	Míate ŋu aƒo tsi o.
Right now it’s just water.	Fifia ya, tsi koe wònye.
This year has been a tough one for many.	Ƒe sia nye ƒe sesẽ aɖe na ame geɖe.
He needs more time.	Ehiã ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu.
There was no word for it.	Nya aɖeke menɔ anyi na esia o.
We can all keep going like this.	Mí katã míate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim alea.
I put a bit of everything in here.	Metsɔ nusianu ƒe akpa aɖe de afisia vie.
There are many surprises.	Nu geɖe li siwo ŋu wòawɔ nuku le.
Four years earlier.	Ƒe ene do ŋgɔ.

Please stop.	Taflatse ta ema.
This building is in bad shape.	Xɔ sia le nɔnɔme gbegblẽ me.
But there was no one there.	Gake ame aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Everyone has money.	Ga le amesiame si.
But that is impossible.	Gake ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Things will never go away for us.	Nuwo mava yi na mí gbeɖe o.
But this is a point.	Gake nya aɖee nye esia.
Something inside her laughed happily.	Nane si le eme la ko nu kple dzidzɔ.
This is not a mistake.	Esia menye vodada o.
I want to do something big.	Medi be mawɔ nu gã aɖe.
That was a huge mistake.	Ema nye vodada gã aɖe.
See? 	Kpɔ?
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
He had never seen this before.	Mekpɔ esia kpɔ o.
There will never be time.	Ɣeyiɣi manɔ anyi gbeɖe o.
Obviously, that comes at a cost.	Edze ƒã be ema va xɔa ga geɖe.
But it can go a little further.	Gake ate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ vie wu ema.
We love that place.	Teƒe ma dzɔa dzi na mí ŋutɔ.
Tell me what happened.	Gblɔ nusi dzɔ nam.
The truth is on our side.	Nyateƒea le míaƒe akpa dzi.
I came before you.	Meva do ŋgɔ na mi.
Several died with a back wind.	Ame geɖe ku kple ya si ƒo tso megbe.
But it doesn’t matter much.	Gake mehiã boo o.
It didn’t happen.	Meva eme o.
You're not the head.	Wò ko ta.
The effect was superb.	Dɔ si wòwɔ ɖe ame dzi la de ŋgɔ ŋutɔ.
The people who died here never made it home.	Ame siwo ku le afisia la mekpɔ mɔ yi aƒeme gbeɖe o.
People react to it.	Amewo wɔa nu ɖe ​​eŋu.
I need more money.	Mehiã ga geɖe wu.
In fact, these two things are really different.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu eve siawo to vovo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Many cars were damaged.	Ʋu geɖe dome gblẽ.
And that’s pretty amazing too.	Eye esia hã wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Talk to the police.	Ƒo nu kple kpovitɔwo.
I hope this is not a mistake.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia menye vodada o.
The whole thing is absurd.	Nya bliboa nye nusi me susu mele o.

And you’re in it.	Kple wò le eme.
It’s not a great voice.	Menye gbe gã aɖee wònye o.

Only now can we know.	Fifia koe míate ŋu anya.
I ordered someone.	Meɖe gbe na ame aɖe.
I have just arrived here myself.	Ðeko nye ŋutɔ meva ɖo afisia teti koe nye ema.

Please share more if you can.	Taflatse ma geɖe wu ne àte ŋui.
I would have done the same.	Anye ne nye hã mawɔe nenema hafi.
You can’t beat me.	Màte ŋu aɖu dzinye o.
He doesn’t know what happened to them.	Menya nu si dzɔ ɖe wo dzi o.
He wasn’t sure.	Meka ɖe edzi o.

But not about this.	Gake menye le esia ŋu o.
I know where he lived.	Menya afisi wònɔ.
No food, no water.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke meli o, tsi aɖeke meli o.
He was just a great guy.	Ŋutsu gã aɖe koe wònye.
Nothing else comes up.	Nu bubu aɖeke meva doa mo ɖa o.
I can’t undress myself.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe awu le ɖokuinye ŋu o.
I couldn’t understand why he didn’t.	Nyemete ŋu se nusita mewɔe nenema o la gɔme o.
No one has planned it.	Ame aɖeke meɖoe o.
Put your foot down.	Da wò afɔ ɖe anyi.
That finally happened.	Ema dzɔ mlɔeba.
Look, too.	Kpɔ ɖa, hã.
It was just a word or two.	Nya ɖeka alo eve koe wònye.
Quite the opposite is true.	Nusi to vovo kura na emae nye nyateƒe.
It couldn’t have been easy.	Mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe hafi o.
I wanted to do something that wouldn’t.	Medi be mawɔ nane si mawɔe nenema o.
It’s not how you got there.	Menye alesi nèwɔ va ɖoe ye o.
Every situation is different.	Nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
I have absolutely no problem with it.	Kuxi aɖeke kura mele ŋunye le eŋu o.
I tried to see things differently.	Medze agbagba be makpɔ nuwo le mɔ bubu nu.
That’s a bit much.	Ema sɔ gbɔ vie.
Same thing in fact.	Nu ma ke le nyateƒe me.
Drive the car carefully.	Ʋu ʋua nyuie.
I can’t say which which.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi kae o.
Perhaps you can explain.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu aɖe eme.
You can do it from home.	Àte ŋu awɔe tso aƒeme.
We’ve been at it for a month.	Míele edzi ɣleti ɖeka enye sia.
No one came near him.	Ame aɖeke mete ɖe eŋu o.
I was on my own.	Menɔ ɖokuinye si.
People are living longer these days than ever before.	Amewo le agbe didi wu tsã le ŋkeke siawo me.
He was a very small man.	Enye ame sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
If only it would work for me.	Ne ɖe wòawɔ dɔ nam la, anye ne ewɔ dɔ nam.
It was amazing that each of us survived.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ be mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe tsi agbe.
They have no problems.	Kuxi aɖeke mele wo ŋu o.
I don’t think we know much about his past.	Nyemesusu be míenya nu boo aɖeke tso eƒe agbe si wònɔ va yi ŋu o.
Good morning.	Ŋdi.
That can’t happen!	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o!
A lot of things.	Nu geɖe.
He was a newcomer.	Enye ame yeye aɖe.
That’s because we’re tired.	Esi ɖeɖi te mía ŋu tae nye ema.
I did it for a reason.	Susu aɖe tae mewɔe ɖo.
That is more important than anything else.	Ema le vevie wu nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
But two things bothered me.	Gake nu eve aɖewo ɖe fu nam.
It’s not just the first one.	Menye gbãtɔ koe o.
But there’s something going on with this guy there.	Gake nane le edzi yim le ŋutsu sia ŋu le afima.
Death is life.	Ku nye agbe.
Go back in time again.	Trɔ yi ɣeyiɣi me ake.
Everyone is so organized.	Amesiame le ɖoɖo nu ale gbegbe.
If anyone knows where he might be, please contact me.	Ne ame aɖe nya afisi wòate ŋu anɔ la, taflatse te ɖe ŋunye.
I never had that before.	Ema menɔ asinye kpɔ o.
No one had ever seen them.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ wo kpɔ o.
Turn once or twice, if necessary.	Trɔ zi ɖeka alo zi eve, ne ehiã.
Everyone laughed at me at once.	Amesiame ko nu nam zi ɖeka.
Some people got hot.	Ame aɖewo xɔ dzo.
He tried again and again.	Edze agbagba zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
This isn’t a car.	Esia menye ʋu o.
Why are they doing this?	Nukatae wole esia wɔm?
And to some extent they are important.	Eye vaseɖe afi aɖe la, wole vevie.
Life is too short.	Agbe le kpuie akpa.
Stop what you are doing now.	Dzudzɔ nusi wɔm nèle fifia.
You never know what they’re going through.	Mènya nusi me tom wole gbeɖe o.
Or find something better to do.	Alo di nane si nyo wu nàwɔ.
But he doesn’t do that.	Gake mewɔa nu ma o.
He has been sick for a long time.	Edze dɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
He's just fucking that up.	Ðeko wòle fu ɖem na ema.
I will do the same for you.	Nye hã mawɔ nenema ke na wò.
I know it seems like a simple problem.	Menya be edze abe kuxi bɔbɔe aɖee wònye ene.
Something in mine.	Nane le ya me.
There is no time like the present.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli abe fifia ene o.
Now it can’t happen.	Fifia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
That part is obvious.	Akpa ma dze ƒã.
There was no problem.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Yet no one came to their rescue.	Ke hã ame aɖeke meva ɖe wo ta o.
I don’t understand these people.	Nyemese ame siawo gɔme o.
I don’t want to know anything.	Nyemedi be manya naneke o.
But there was no help for it.	Gake kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke menɔ anyi ɖe eŋu o.
It should work better.	Ele be wòawɔ dɔ nyuie wu.
His job is difficult.	Eƒe dɔa sesẽ.
I think it may not have been active.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ mewɔ dɔ vevie o.
This is closer to me.	Esia te ɖe ŋunye wu.
None of us will ever know.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke manya gbeɖe o.

It could be thousands.	Ate ŋu anye akpe geɖe.

Maybe, never.	Ðewohĩ, menye gbeɖe o.
I made a plan for it.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
I know this is right.	Menya be esia sɔ.
Today, he only has one.	Egbea la, ɖeka koe le esi.
It is very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ.
But he couldn’t.	Gake mete ŋui o.
Again, that’s fine.	Le afisia hã la, esia nyo.
That’s how long we have to make a plan.	Emae nye ɣeyiɣi didi si wòle be míawɔ ɖoɖo aɖe.
He will find you.	Akpɔ wò.
It was just that way.	Ðeko wònɔ nenema.
There is no air.	Ya mele o.
Critical.	Nye nu sesẽ.
It’s a part of it.	Eƒe akpa aɖe.
But it made sense.	Gake susu nɔ eme.
A year ago that wouldn’t have been the case.	Ƒe ɖeka enye sia la, anye ne manɔ nenema o.
He couldn’t write anything.	Mete ŋu ŋlɔ naneke o.
I am not okay with this.	Nyemele nyuie le esia ŋu.
It really shouldn’t have surprised anyone.	Mele be wòawɔ nuku na ame aɖeke ŋutɔŋutɔ hafi o.
This came as a bit of a surprise to many.	Esia wɔ nuku na ame geɖe vie.
She has no children of her own.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe vi aɖeke mele esi o.
With no backing.	Esi megbe aɖeke menɔ eŋu o ta la.

I was very excited.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
He looked very, very, very tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ ene.
Let’s try this out.	Mina míate esia kpɔ.
I thought that was amazing.	Mesusu be ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Everything is working great.	Nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie ŋutɔ.

I think he’s real too.	Mesusu be eya hã nye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The situation here is a bit different.	Nɔnɔme si le afisia to vovo vie.
This is actually a powerful machine.	Le nyateƒe me la, mɔ̃ sesẽ aɖee nye esia.
Something about blood.	Nane si ku ɖe ʋu ŋu.
That’s what it is for me.	Emae nye ema nam.
That work has to be done tomorrow.	Ele be woawɔ dɔ ma etsɔ.
If you’re going to kill us, go ahead.	Ne èle mía wu ge la, yi ŋgɔ.
This is a small segment of the population.	Esia nye amewo ƒe akpa sue aɖe.
Life is too hard.	Agbe sesẽ akpa.
Things will get hot.	Nuwo axɔ dzo.
My teacher is very difficult.	Nye nufiala sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I need more time than that.	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu ema.
But in reality, there is still much to do.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.
Maybe he was never really there.	Ðewohĩ menɔ afima ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o.
But it wasn’t to my liking.	Gake menye nusi dze ŋunye o.
What happened to me happened a long time ago.	Nusi dzɔ ɖe dzinye la dzɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
You can’t work any other way.	Màte ŋu awɔ dɔ le mɔ bubu aɖeke nu o.

For what reason we cannot know.	Susu si tae míate ŋu anya o.
I can talk about it more objectively now.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu tso eŋu le susu me wu fifia.
I wanted his child.	Medi eƒe vi.
This is all I could think of.	Esia koe nye esi ŋu mete ŋu bu.
What do we have here?	Nukae le mía si le afisia?
But it is not a thing of the past.	Gake menye nusi va yi o.

I stood up with stiffness.	Metsi tre kple sesẽ.
I was in a different phase of my life.	Menɔ nye agbe ƒe akpa bubu aɖe me.
We were too busy.	Vovo menɔ mía ŋu akpa.
We can’t do that.	Míate ŋu awɔ ema o.

I asked one man how long this had been going on.	Mebia ŋutsu aɖe be ɣeyiɣi didi kae nu sia nɔ edzi yim hã.

There was no room for anyone else.	Teƒe menɔ anyi na ame bubu o.
He didn’t do it right.	Mewɔe nyuie o.

Probably more than a few.	Ðewohĩ wu ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
He doesn’t seem to have a chance.	Edze abe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke meli nɛ o ene.
I couldn’t escape.	Nyemete ŋu si dzo o.
Too many people died.	Ame geɖe akpa ku.

In theory, it looks like this should work.	Le susu me la, edze abe ele be esia nawɔ dɔ ene.

I would love to do that.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔe nenema.
I am not able to do that.	Nyemete ŋu le ema wɔm o.
He was a very small man.	Enye ame sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
But it won’t help either.	Gake maɖe vi aɖeke hã o.
He wouldn’t be either.	Eya hã manɔ nenema o.
But no one wanted to go.	Gake ame aɖeke medi be yeayi o.
There were only two people.	Ame eve koe nɔ anyi.
He couldn’t escape in any way.	Mete ŋu si le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
This was last four years ago.	Esia nye mamlɛtɔ ƒe ene enye sia.
We can walk to anything.	Míate ŋu azɔ ayi nusianu gbɔ.
And he too is a lot of fun to work with.	Eye eya hã doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
Everyone laughed in his face.	Amesiame ko nu le mo nɛ.
We can try it.	Míate ŋu ate kpɔ.
But they had a point.	Gake nya aɖe nɔ wo si.
I have everything here.	Nusianu le asinye le afisia.
I can’t in any way.	Nyemate ŋui le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I have a lot to tell you.	Nya geɖe le asinye magblɔ na mi.
Once, twice, several times.	Zi ɖeka, zi eve, zi geɖe.
In this city there are as many guns as there are people.	Le du sia me la, tu sɔ gbɔ abe amewo ene.
None of them are true.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
But this happened over time.	Gake esia dzɔ le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe.
If you have two objects, each one should be doing something different.	Ne nu eve le asiwò la, ele be wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe nanɔ nu bubu aɖe wɔm.
Who's to say if this is against the law?	Amekae agblɔ nenye be esia tsi tre ɖe se ŋu?
It’s kind of interesting.	Enye ƒomevi aɖe si doa dzidzɔ na ame.
Know where he was.	Nya afi si wònɔ.
The mountains here are so beautiful.	To siwo le afisia nya kpɔ ŋutɔ ale gbegbe.
He doesn’t seem old enough to talk.	Edze abe metsi ale gbegbe be wòate ŋu aƒo nu o ene.
Which is real, clearly.	Nusi nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ, eme kɔ ƒã.
Now go ahead and do it.	Azɔ yi ŋgɔ.
But he would if he could.	Gake awɔe ne ɖe wòate ŋui.
It’s like finding a home while you’re at home.	Ðeko wòle abe aƒe didi esime nèle aƒeme ene.
It can do wrong, of course.	Ate ŋu awɔ nu gbegblẽ ya.
He was a very charming person.	Enye amesi ƒe nu lé dzi na ame ŋutɔ.
Without preconditions.	Nɔnɔme aɖeke manɔmee do ŋgɔ.
What is wrong with this rule.	Nukae gblẽ le se sia me.
Everyone knows who is responsible for his death.	Amesiame nya amesi gbɔ eƒe ku tso.
A man spoke to me.	Ŋutsu aɖe ƒo nu nam.
It was just next door.	Xɔ si te ɖe mía ŋu koe wònye.
It must be very frustrating.	Ele be wòate ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
To see so many of them would have been unhappy.	Be makpɔ wo dometɔ geɖe alea la, anye ne makpɔ dzidzɔ o.
It’s what you’re looking for.	Enye nusi dim nèle.
This was another issue we had.	Esia hã nye nya bubu si nɔ mía si.
Today, this post is for you.	Egbea, nya sia nye na wò.
It would be a huge challenge.	Anye kuxi gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t go anywhere.	Nyemete ŋu yi afi aɖeke o.
Any help would be great.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe anyo ŋutɔ.
Take another step.	Ðe afɔ bubu aɖe dzi.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Turn your attention away.	Trɔ wò susu ɖa.
A man is a two-legged thing.	Ŋutsu nye nu si si afɔ eve le.
He must have been waiting for someone.	Anɔ eme be ame aɖee wònɔ lalam.
But he didn’t do anything.	Gake mewɔ naneke o.
But it was never, ever true.	Gake menye nyateƒe kpɔ, kpɔ o.
It’s a real thing.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I just need to talk to you.	Ðeko wòle be maƒo nu kpli wò.
I didn't go.	Medo go o.
This works well.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie.
Not in the past.	Menye tsã o.
Maybe there is nothing.	Ðewohĩ naneke meli o.
I hope you know that too.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wò hã ènya ema.
The first one that.	Gbãtɔ si.
He will today, in fact.	Awɔe egbea, le nyateƒe me.
I had to do some very difficult things.	Ele be mawɔ nu sesẽ aɖewo ŋutɔ.
Solve the following problem.	Kpɔ kuxi si gbɔna gbɔ.
He put his hand in front of his face.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ɖo eƒe mo ŋgɔ.
But some people don’t.	Gake ame aɖewo ya mewɔa esia o.
Change his name.	Trɔ eƒe ŋkɔ.
Obviously, this should never be done.	Edze ƒã be mele be woawɔ esia gbeɖe o.
In this life.	Le agbe sia me.
I know exactly what happened, and yet.	Menya nusi tututu dzɔ, eye ke hã.
Anger was brief.	Dziku nɔ kpuie.
And he's probably not doing well at that.	Eye ɖewohĩ mele edzi yim nyuie le ema me o.
I'm going to miss you.	Mele wò susu ge.
But now, of course.	Gake fifia ya.
I tried to figure out what happened.	Medze agbagba be manya nu si dzɔ.
The, the house.	La, aƒe la.
He angrily left the room.	Etsɔ dziku do go le xɔa me.
That was a great man.	Ame gã aɖee nye ema.
Talk to everyone.	Ƒo nu kple ame sia ame.
I'm doing better now, I'm tired.	Mele edzi dzem nyuie wu fifia, ɖeɖi te ŋunye.
There is some kind of attitude.	Nɔnɔme aɖe ƒomevi aɖe li.
Many men came out.	Ŋutsu geɖe va do.
Pay the debt in advance.	Fe fe do ŋgɔ.
I've heard of it though.	Mese nu tso eŋu kpɔ gake.
I don’t have time.	Ɣeyiɣi mele asinye o.
But it doesn’t work.	Gake mewɔa dɔ o.
I think it could be something else.	Mesusu be ate ŋu anye nu bubu aɖe hã.
This is different from just hard work.	Esia to vovo na dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ ko.
Everyone there thought it was a good idea.	Amesiame si le afi ma susui be enye susu nyui aɖe.
But now they will all starve.	Gake azɔ la, dɔ awu wo katã.
We are waiting.	Míele lalam.
He can't do much more.	Mate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe wu ema o.
Or my job anywhere else, really.	Alo nye dɔ le teƒe bubu ɖesiaɖe, le nyateƒe me.
I will take care of feeding him.	Nyee akpɔ nuɖuɖu nɛ dzi.
That’s obvious.	Ema dze ƒã.
Tell me this is not true.	Gblɔ nam be esia menye nyateƒe o.
He wasn’t alone this time.	Menye eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi zi sia o.
This wasn’t easy.	Esia menɔ bɔbɔe o.
The complete opposite is also true.	Nusi tsi tre ɖe eŋu kura hã nye nyateƒe.
What was he going to do with it?.	Nukae wònɔ wɔwɔ ge kplii?.
Back from the long dead.	Trɔ gbɔ tso ame kuku siwo nɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe la me.
We have to do what is necessary.	Ele be míawɔ nu si hiã.
To his surprise, no one was there.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ be ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
I gave up a while ago.	Meɖe asi le eŋu ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye sia.
No one can do that.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ nu ma o.
But we can only do this if we know.	Gake ne míenya ko hafi míate ŋu awɔ esia.
Perhaps they will join him.	Ðewohĩ woawɔ ɖeka kplii.
I saw the snake.	Mekpɔ da la.
He's just fucking everything up and he'll never know.	Ðeko wòle fu ɖem na nusianu eye manya gbeɖe o.
This seems quite strange.	Esia dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku kura ene.
It looked so good.	Edze nyuie nenema gbegbe.
We don’t know if he’s going to live.	Míenya nenye be ele agbe nɔ ge o.
There is something good here.	Nu nyui aɖe le afisia.
Anything can be true.	Nusianu ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
A state of mind.	Susu ƒe nɔnɔme aɖe.
No one said the big time was easy.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ be ɣeyiɣi gã la le bɔbɔe o.
Let go of it.	Ðe asi le eŋu.
People see through it, see the past.	Amewo kpɔa nu to eme, kpɔa nu siwo va yi.
This car is not there.	Ʋu sia mele afima o.
This is totally appropriate.	Esia sɔ kura.
Last week was tough.	Kwasiɖa si va yi la sesẽ ŋutɔ.
But there is no one there.	Gake ame aɖeke mele afima o.
I am the only one here.	Nye ɖeka koe le afisia.
That’s a strategy that has never worked well.	Ema nye aɖaŋu si mewɔ dɔ nyuie kpɔ o.
I knew he had one.	Menya be ɖeka le esi.
I am the right person.	Nyee nye ame si sɔ.
Talk to him	Ƒo nu kplii .
Everyone is equal to him.	Amesiame sɔ kplii.
Not one in a thousand.	Menye ɖeka le ame akpe ɖeka me o.
Otherwise, he wouldn’t.	Ne menye nenema o la, mawɔe nenema o.
And so did I.	Eye nye hã.
In a sense, they have a point.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, nya aɖe le wo si.
This is a pretty big deal.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I asked what it was.	Mebia be nukae wònye hã.
It looked like a house.	Edze abe aƒe ene.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si sɔ kplii kpɔ o.
No one should behave that way.	Mele be ame aɖeke nawɔ nu nenema o.
Go back to my room.	Trɔ yi nye xɔ me.
Now we are in a different situation.	Fifia míele nɔnɔme bubu me.
This is not necessarily true.	Esia menye nyateƒe kokoko o.
I think we’re going to do it.	Mesusu be míele ewɔ ge.
But it doesn’t seem to work.	Gake edze abe mewɔa dɔ o ene.
This task is definitely under you.	Dɔ sia le wò te godoo.
Throughout the difficult situation.	Le nɔnɔme sesẽ bliboa me.
Still, something had to be done,	Ke hã, ele be woawɔ nane, .
So, they have no one.	Eya ta, ame aɖeke mele wo si o.
I can’t tell if that’s the case.	Nyemate ŋu anya nenye be esia le nenema o.
I can’t do that.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema o.
He didn’t seem to know.	Ewɔ abe ɖe menya nu o ene.
He landed right on it.	Edze anyi ɖe edzi tututu.
Not that he liked the job.	Menye ɖe dɔa dze eŋu o.
Come on in!.	Va ge ɖe eme!.
It’s a good quality.	Enye nɔnɔme nyui aɖe.
We have another kind of problem.	Kuxi bubu ƒomevi aɖe hã le mía ŋu.
There were only two names.	Ŋkɔ eve koe nɔ anyi.
It started at once.	Edze egɔme zi ɖeka.
We are, in fact.	Míenye, le nyateƒe me.
That sounds good, thanks.	Ema ɖi nyuie, akpe.
I want you too much.	Medi wò akpa.
He had never found anything.	Meke ɖe naneke ŋu kpɔ o.
He never knew much.	Menya nu geɖe kpɔ o.
I was behind in my work.	Metsi megbe le nye dɔa me.
This man offered me a job.	Ŋutsu sia tsɔ dɔ aɖe nam.
We have a great voice.	Gbe gã aɖe le mía si.
I don't think anyone will steal them.	Mesusu be ame aɖeke afi wo o.
He wasn’t a bit worried about that sort of thing.	Metsi dzi ɖe nu ma ƒomevi ŋu vie o.
They had practically nothing to do.	Naneke menɔ wo si woawɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ kloe o.
He had a good meal.	Nuɖuɖu nyui aɖe nɔ esi.
Nobody asked me to do it.	Ame aɖeke mebia tso asinye be mawɔe o.
No one could get close to him.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu te ɖe eŋu o.
I have no problem with this.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ŋunye le esia ŋu o.
Something hit my head.	Nane ƒo ta nam.
It may happen, or it may not.	Ate ŋu adzɔ, alo mate ŋui o.
That means everything.	Ema fia nusianu.
The first is a man.	Gbãtɔ nye ŋutsu.
It's too complicated.	Enye nusi me kɔ akpa.
Always meet them.	Do go wo ɣesiaɣi.
All things have a type.	Nuwo katã ƒe ƒomevi aɖe le wo si.
On a real machine, you can’t.	Le mɔ̃ ŋutɔŋutɔ dzi la, màte ŋui o.
A lot has changed in this city.	Nu geɖe trɔ le du sia me.
And a man beneath them.	Eye ŋutsu aɖe si le wo te.
I always do this .	Mewɔa esia ɣesiaɣi .
It didn’t bother him.	Meɖe fu nɛ o.
I can’t do anything else.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
There was no room, no room.	Xɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o, xɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
That’s a very good thing.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ.
If you have any questions, please comment here.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò la, taflatse, ƒo nu le afisia.
There is a simple reason.	Susu bɔbɔe aɖe li si tae.
Something was obviously wrong.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ le eŋu.
It was one of the few things he liked about me.	Enye nu ʋɛ siwo do dzidzɔ nɛ le ŋunye la dometɔ ɖeka.
Everyone knows everything.	Amesiame nya nusianu.
People also enjoy it.	Amewo hã kpɔa dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu.
But other than that, he was totally the same.	Gake ne menye nenema o la, eya hã nɔ nenema kura.
He, or she, disappeared.	Eya, alo eya, bu.
We shouldn’t be too strict.	Mele be míawɔ nu sesẽ akpa o.
That’s not the case here.	Menye emae le afisia o.
That’s another thing, too.	Ema hã nye nu bubu aɖe.
And it’s smart.	Eye edze aɖaŋu.
Perhaps this is in his character.	Ðewohĩ esia le eƒe nɔnɔme me.
There were very few things.	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ anyi.
I could remember that .	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi be .
You have two months.	Ɣleti eve le asiwò.
That’s what got to me.	Emae nye nusi va ɖo menye.
I shouldn’t have been surprised.	Mele be wòawɔ nuku nam hafi o.
What would that be.	Nukae anye ema.
I don’t know exactly where they are.	Nyemenya afi si tututu wole o.
No time for either, right now.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli na wo dometɔ aɖeke o, fifia.
Every hour.	Gaƒoƒo ɖesiaɖe.
His face was angry now.	Eƒe mo do dziku azɔ.
Quite the opposite.	Nusi to vovo kura na esia.
At the last moment.	Le ɣeyiɣi mamlɛtɔ me.
Maybe there were more of them on board.	Ðewohĩ wo dometɔ geɖe wu nɔ ʋua me.
It’s just kind of.	Enye ƒomevi aɖe ko.
That’s why it’s important.	Esia tae wòle vevie ɖo.
Or as it is.	Alo abe alesi wòle ene.
His real life began after that.	Eƒe agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ dze egɔme le ema megbe.
Pay him a debt.	Do fe nɛ.
It was a happy time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi si me dzidzɔ le.
I felt like a child.	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ɖevi ene.
What can any of them say about this? 	Nya kae wo dometɔ aɖe ate ŋu agblɔ tso nya sia ŋu?
There is so much going on.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le edzi yim.
Everyone has their own preferences.	Amesiame le eƒe didi nu.
It’s a pretty big deal now.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ fifia.
It’s like hard work.	Ele abe dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ ene.
He usually doesn’t ask them any questions.	Zi geɖe la, mebiaa nya aɖeke le wo si o.
This rule is outdated.	Se sia do xoxo.
In some cases, it is impossible.	Le go aɖewo me la, manya wɔ o.
I don’t think that’s right.	Nyemesusu be esia sɔ o.
A very difficult situation.	Nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
People are angry.	Amewo doa dziku.
And they are like that.	Eye wole nenema.

But there were some bad years there.	Gake ƒe gbegblẽ aɖewo nɔ afima.
This infuriated him.	Nya sia do dziku nɛ.
I need to call someone.	Ele be maƒo ka na ame aɖe.
It’s your job.	Enye wò dɔ.
One of the better ones too.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka si nyo wu hã.
I don’t trust myself in this.	Nyemeka ɖe ɖokuinye dzi le esia me o.
In fact, it cannot be.	Le nyateƒe me la, mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
This case is perfect for the job.	Nya sia sɔ nyuie na dɔa.
My life, his life.	Nye agbe, eƒe agbe.
It will take several days.	Axɔ ŋkeke geɖe.
Show people that we are together.	Fia amewo be míele ɖekae.
Maybe you can help you.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
This is simply not necessary.	Ðeko esia mehiã o.
You can do it over many years.	Àte ŋu awɔe le ƒe geɖe me.
Still, it’s a good thing to do.	Ke hã, enye nu nyui aɖe si nàwɔ.
I can’t express myself properly.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nye susu agblɔ nyuie o.
This is an exception though.	Esia nye nusi to vovo gake.
I sent them to work.	Meɖo wo ɖe dɔ me.
But this year is a little different.	Gake ƒe sia ya to vovo vie.
That’s neither here nor there.	Ema menye afisia alo afima o.
The first is about certain times.	Gbãtɔ ku ɖe ɣeyiɣi aɖewo ŋu.
That must have been very difficult.	Ema anya sesẽ ŋutɔ.
He just couldn’t.	Ðeko mete ŋui o.
And at breakfast.	Eye le ŋdi nuɖuɖu me.
People like you and me.	Ame siwo le abe nye kple wò ene.
That’s a good thing.	Nya nyui aɖee nye ema.
Back leg time.	Megbe afɔ ɣeyiɣi.
It could be my trap.	Ate ŋu anye nye mɔ̃.
I’m glad it worked out.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
I just tried to save myself.	Ðeko medze agbagba be maɖe ɖokuinye.
We just had limited time.	Ðeko ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe nɔ mía si.
This is not a new area of ​​law.	Esia menye se ƒe akpa yeye aɖeke o.
Be careful with the gun.	Kpɔ nyuie le tu la ŋu.
It's going on.	Ele edzi yim.
More than anything else.	Nusi wu nusianu.
But a new person is a new person.	Gake ame yeye nye ame yeye.
For the sake of our tribe.	Le míaƒe to la ta.
There is as much money in it as you do.	Ga geɖe le eme abe wò ke ene.
Trust me on this one.	Ka ɖe dzinye le esia ŋu.

He looked tired and exhausted.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu eye ɖeɖi te eŋu ene.
No one could beat me.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu ƒom o.
Here is a character.	Ame aɖe ƒe nɔnɔme dze le afisia.
He achieved what many did not see.	Ewɔ nusi ame geɖe mekpɔ o la gbɔ.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
Mado go o.	Mado go o.
Not his own room either.	Menye eya ŋutɔ ƒe xɔ hã o.
There was no one in the room.	Ame aɖeke menɔ xɔa me o.
It will never work.	Mawɔ dɔ gbeɖe o.
If it doesn’t work .	Ne mewɔ dɔ o la .
You can call him afterwards.	Àte ŋu aƒo ka nɛ le ema megbe.
We don't know what.	Míenya nusi kae o.
But why are you acting like this?	Gake nukatae nèle nu wɔm alea?
I think you have a problem.	Mesusu be kuxi aɖe le ŋuwò.

It’s not difficult either.	Menye nu sesẽ hã o.

More food and food.	Nuɖuɖu kple nuɖuɖu geɖe wu.
I don’t know why this has to be.	Nyemenya nusita wòle be esia nanɔ nenema o.
You can comment as often as you like.	Àte ŋu aɖo nya ŋu zi alesi nèdi.
And without that.	Eye ema manɔmee.

How did you come to that conclusion?	Aleke nèwɔ va ƒo nya ta alea?
The result was excellent.	Nusi do tso eme la nyo ŋutɔ.
Something is odd.	Nane nye nusi mewɔ nuku o.
Tell us more about it.	Gblɔ nu geɖe tso eŋu na mí.
A mentally retarded man is pleading.	Ŋutsu aɖe si ƒe susu mewɔ dɔ nyuie o le kuku ɖem.
I couldn’t stop thinking about it.	Nyemete ŋu dzudzɔ eŋu bubu o.
He was kind of surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ le mɔ aɖe nu.
There were two reasons, perhaps, for this.	Susu eve aɖewo nɔ anyi, ɖewohĩ, na esia.
I want to go out more.	Medi be mado go geɖe wu.
Very, very watery.	Tsi le eme ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.

Say the exact same thing to him.	Gblɔ nya ma ke tututu nɛ.
A man she had never seen before stepped forward.	Ŋutsu aɖe si mekpɔ kpɔ o la do afɔ ɖe ŋgɔ.
But when things went wrong, he had no plan.	Gake esi nuwo meva yi nyuie o la, ɖoɖo aɖeke menɔ esi o.

No one knows about you.	Ame aɖeke menya nu tso ŋuwò o.
I didn’t know you were here, in the house.	Nyemenya be èle afisia, le aƒea me o.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe tae esia dzɔ ɖo.

The better part of an hour passed.	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka ƒe akpa si nyo wu la va yi.

Some weeks are like that.	Kwasiɖa aɖewo nɔa nenema.
My job was pretty simple.	Nye dɔa nɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
It’s a very complicated thing.	Enye nusi me kɔ ŋutɔ.

They are working around the clock on this.	Wole dɔ wɔm ŋkeke kple zã le esia ŋu.

But tell me what you think!.	Gake gblɔ nusi nèsusu nam!.
A really great house.	Aƒe gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That's why.	Eya tae.
There was no fire.	Dzo aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
No one is eating right now.	Ame aɖeke mele nu ɖum fifia o.
That's pretty much it for this week.	Emae nye nusi sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ na kwasiɖa sia.
I have seen them before.	Mekpɔ wo do ŋgɔ.
It’s not going up there anymore.	Megale dzi yim le afima o.
There is no clear right or wrong here.	Nu nyui alo nu gbegblẽ aɖeke mele afisia si me kɔ o.
What about that, though.	Ke ema ya ɖe.
I am working on it.	Mele dɔ wɔm tso eŋu.
It is a good book.	Agbalẽ nyui aɖee wònye.
This is a complete lie.	Esia nye alakpa kura.
And my hand touched it.	Eye nye asi ka asi eŋu.
You have a great life with us.	Agbe gã aɖe le asiwò kpli mí.
And just in the past two days.	Eye ŋkeke eve siwo va yi me koe nye ema.
It’s just something.	Nane koe wònye.
I can’t really talk right now.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu ŋutɔŋutɔ fifia o.
I actually enjoyed it a lot.	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Obviously, this is not possible.	Edze ƒã be esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I can’t get you out of my mind.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe wò le nye susu me o.
He seemed surprised.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ ene.
See how you want.	Kpɔ alesi nèdi.
It could be in better shape.	Ate ŋu anɔ nɔnɔme nyui me wu.
There’s nothing for you here.	Naneke meli na wò le afisia o.
Maybe a few here and there.	Ðewohĩ ʋɛ aɖewo le afisia kple afima.
I wasn’t too excited.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ akpa o.
But it won’t do you any good at all.	Gake mawɔ nu nyui aɖeke na wò kura o.
I needed a room.	Mehiã xɔ aɖe.
I knew it was there.	Menya be ele afima.
Call us if you have any questions.	Ƒo ka na mí ne nya aɖe le asiwò.
This is not a difficult thing.	Esia menye nu sesẽ aɖeke o.
I was a little resistant.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu vie.
I barely knew this man.	Ƒã hafi menya ŋutsu sia.
But he does have something of mine.	Gake nye nane le esi ya.
This was never the case.	Esia menɔ alea gbeɖe o.
Please stay here.	Taflatse nɔ afisia.
I can’t answer that.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo nya ma ŋu o.
That’s all there is to it.	Ema koe nye nusi le eme.
You’ve done that.	Wòe wɔe nenema.
He had never seen one.	Mekpɔ ɖeke kpɔ o.
This will be a difficult task.	Esia anye dɔ sesẽ aɖe.
It will calm down after a while.	Aɖe dzi ɖi le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe.
This is very important to do.	Esia wɔwɔ le vevie ŋutɔ.
I had mine before.	Nye tɔ nɔ asinye kpɔ.
It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
Police were searching for the missing child.	Kpovitɔwo nɔ ɖevi si bu la dim.
There are two reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo tae esia dzɔ ɖo.
But he made a mistake.	Gake ewɔ vodada.
I do remember it from school.	Meɖo ŋku edzi tso suku ya.
I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
Everyone seems to be talking about that moment.	Edze abe ame sia ame le nu ƒom tso ɣeyiɣi ma ŋu ene.
I am very happy to be here.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mele afisia.
It could have been one of them.	Ate ŋu anye wo dometɔ aɖe hafi.
I’m not passing anything coming my way, see.	Nyemele naneke tom le nye mɔ dzi gbɔna o, kpɔ ɖa.
Now, of course.	Fifia ya.
That is not good news.	Ema menye nya nyui aɖeke o.
But that is not the case now.	Gake mele nenema fifia o.
This doesn’t work.	Esia mewɔa dɔ o.
And that’s enough.	Eye esia sɔ gbɔ.
Salt and fresh water work together.	Dze kple tsi nyui wɔa dɔ ɖekae.
Something’s wrong with your life, you know.	Nane gblẽ le wò agbe ŋu, ènya.
But he made a mistake.	Gake ewɔ vodada.
However, this has happened in the past.	Ke hã, esia dzɔ va yi.
What? 	Nu ka?
There is a reason for this.	Susu le esia me.
I could never ask you.	Nyemete ŋu bia wò kpɔ o.
He needed some time to himself.	Ehiã ɣeyiɣi aɖe na eɖokui.
For many reasons.	Le nu geɖe ta.
The real thing.	Nya la ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But that was the first.	Gake emae nye gbãtɔ.
There might have been.	Ðewohĩ anɔ anyi hafi.
However, it seems strange for a newbie like myself.	Ke hã, edze abe ewɔ nuku na ame yeye abe nye ŋutɔ ene.
I gave him everything.	Metsɔ nusianu nɛ.
I was satisfied.	Nye dzi dze eme.
Everyone came down with it.	Amesiame ɖi va kple esia.
And my first day at work.	Eye nye ŋkeke gbãtɔ hã le dɔme.
Twice a week.	Zi eve le kwasiɖa me.
You can stay there as long as you want.	Àte ŋu anɔ afima ɣeyiɣi didi si nèdi.
But this is not so new.	Gake esia menye nu yeye nenema gbegbe o.
His life became very pleasant.	Eƒe agbe va dze ame ŋu ŋutɔ.
The truth is quite different.	Nyateƒea to vovo kura.
Our eyes were opened to the whole situation.	Míaƒe ŋku ʋu ɖe nɔnɔme bliboa ŋu.
It’s a difficult thing.	Enye nu sesẽ aɖe.
This is a problem.	Esia nye kuxi.
In fact, the opposite happened.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ.
Too many years.	Ƒe geɖe akpa.
He had no money.	Ga aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
I would be more interested.	Adzɔ dzi nam geɖe wu.
Think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ.
I shouldn’t go to work for another two weeks.	Mele be mayi dɔ dzi kwasiɖa eve bubu o.
There is no one against me.	Ame aɖeke meli si tsi tre ɖe ŋunye o.
It looked good to me.	Edze nyuie nam.
Trust me, he's a good guy.	Ka ɖe dzinye, enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe.
There is absolutely no way.	Mɔ aɖeke kura meli o.
But maybe he didn’t get it right.	Gake ɖewohĩ mese egɔme nyuie o.
Tom bought a new machine.	Tom ƒle mɔ̃ yeye aɖe.
Now there are many possibilities.	Fifia la, nu geɖe li siwo ate ŋu adzɔ.
This probably won’t work.	Anɔ eme be esia maɖe vi o.
Maybe something will happen.	Ðewohĩ nane adzɔ.
I had plenty of time for him.	Mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe nɛ.
Please sign your name.	Taflatse de asi wò ŋkɔ te.
In the same year.	Le ƒe ma ke me.
So, .	Eya ta, .
There is something in that.	Nane le ema me.
We have a good sense of humor.	Susu nyui le mía si.
Everything points to it.	Nusianu fia asi edzi.
Many of them left.	Wo dometɔ geɖe dzo.
Not until this past night.	Menye vaseɖe zã sia si va yi me hafi o.
We need to work on something.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ tso nane ŋu.
But no one knew what to do.	Gake ame aɖeke menya nusi wòawɔ o.
There is reason and there is matter.	Susu li eye nu hã li.
We have no chance in the long term.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke mele mía si le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe me o.
This isn’t surprising.	Esia mewɔ nuku o.
That part of his life was over.	Eƒe agbe ƒe akpa ma va yi.
The opposite is true.	Nusi to vovo na emae nye nyateƒe.
Ya la ku.	Ya la ku.
But it is the right thing to do.	Gake enye nu si sɔ be woawɔ.
As it was, it was.	Abe alesi wònɔ ene.
Plan for something, and when that happens, plan for something else.	Wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe nane ŋu, eye ne nane ma dzɔ la, wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe nu bubu ŋu.
So far nothing works.	Vaseɖe fifia la, naneke mewɔa dɔ o.
He’s been eyeing it for a month.	Eƒe ŋku le eŋu ɣleti ɖeka enye sia.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
But he couldn’t get the job.	Gake mete ŋu xɔ dɔa o.
And on its own.	Eye le eɖokui si.
I would like to know how to do this better.	Madi be manya ale si mawɔ esia nyuie wu.
He will do the right thing.	Awɔ nu si sɔ.
He would never do it.	Mawɔe gbeɖe o.
Not too much, anyway.	Menye nu geɖe akpa o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
In this way, those who.	Le mɔ sia nu la, ame siwo...
And why people do it.	Eye nusita amewo wɔa esia.
I stood up.	Metsi tre.
These kids are tough.	Vi siawo sesẽ.
I was very nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ.
I am not right in myself.	Nyemele eteƒe le ɖokuinye me o.
This could have happened to me.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe dzinye hafi.
I had no desire to tell him anything about myself.	Didi aɖeke menɔ menye be magblɔ nya aɖeke tso ɖokuinye ŋu nɛ o.
Write a book.	Ŋlɔ agbalẽ aɖe.
There were very few books.	Agbalẽ ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ afima.
Finally! 	Mlɔeba!
But it will take some time.	Gake axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
He is fighting more and more.	Ele avu wɔm geɖe wu.
Obviously not you.	Edze ƒã be menye wòe o.
This is consistent with the result.	Esia wɔ ɖeka kple nusi do tso eme.
Please get out of this.	Taflatse do go le esia me.
I am sure he will.	Meka ɖe edzi be awɔe nenema.
In some cases, this is easy.	Le go aɖewo me la, esia le bɔbɔe.
If this happens once, maybe it can happen again.	Ne esia dzɔ zi ɖeka la, ɖewohĩ ate ŋu adzɔ ake.
I wanted money in every way.	Medi ga le mɔ ɖesiaɖe nu.
He doesn’t make mistakes.	Mewɔa vodada o.
It will only last a few days.	Ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe anɔ eme.
But not at the same time.	Gake menye le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me o.
This had not been his plan for his life.	Esia menye eƒe ɖoɖo ɖe eƒe agbe ŋu tsã o.
There were few people, few dogs.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ afima, avu ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ afima.
He couldn’t die.	Mete ŋu ku o.
There was a lot there.	Nu geɖe nɔ afima.
It would be a waste of time.	Anye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
He couldn’t seem to raise his voice.	Edze abe mete ŋu kɔ gbe ɖe dzi o ene.
His voice was a little louder now.	Eƒe gbe sesẽ vie azɔ.
I am among them myself.	Nye ŋutɔ le wo dome.
That’s the interesting part now.	Emae nye akpa si doa dzidzɔ na ame fifia.
But this is quite different.	Gake esia to vovo kura.
It has made so many people.	Ewɔ ame geɖe ŋutɔ.
I have done the same thing myself.	Nye ŋutɔ hã mewɔ nenema ke kpɔ.
Come right at us.	Va mía dzi tututu.
Perhaps you are one of them.	Ðewohĩ ènye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
I can’t imagine life without her.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ agbe le susu me eya manɔmee o.
He was very hot.	Eƒe lãme xɔ dzo ŋutɔ.
I liked mine.	Nye tɔ dze ŋunye.
Do it right this time.	Wɔe nyuie zi sia.
Like, any day.	Abe, ŋkeke ɖesiaɖe ene.
He didn’t see any bodies.	Mekpɔ ame kuku aɖeke o.
We need to do better than this.	Ele be míawɔ nu nyuie wu esia.
You really don’t know about it.	Le nyateƒe me la, mènya nu tso eŋu o.
That would be a great day, that would be a great tomorrow.	Ema anye ŋkeke gã aɖe, ema anye etsɔ gã aɖe.
That everything happened for a reason.	Be susu aɖe tae nusianu dzɔ ɖo.
That’s actually pretty good.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.	Nyemeka ɖe afi si mele vodada wɔm le dzi o.
Quite the opposite, actually.	Nusi to vovo kura na ema, le nyateƒe me.
I know the truth.	Menya nyateƒea.
He seemed more comfortable.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme wu ene.
You can’t fight them like that.	Màte ŋu awɔ avu kpli wo nenema o.
I gave him everything in return.	Metsɔ nusianu nɛ ɖe eteƒe.
No one has ever done that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
That’s possible, too.	Ema hã anya wɔ.
But he wasn’t angry.	Gake medo dziku o.
Now it’s my chance.	Fifia enye nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ.
It’s awesome here.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ le afisia.
He has a house.	Aƒe le esi.
And now this.	Eye fifia esia.
It’s quite the opposite.	Enye nusi to vovo kura na ema.
There are two things involved.	Nu eve le eme.
I know he can do it.	Menya be ate ŋui.
But he didn’t really care.	Gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
But you can do them.	Gake àte ŋu awɔ wo.
I knew it would be.	Menya be anɔ nenema.
I will do things from here on out.	Mawɔ nuwo tso afisia tso fifia dzi.
Know this la.	Menya se la.
It cannot stand still.	Mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe teƒe ɖeka o.
Mary didn’t answer.	Maria meɖo eŋu o.
It might be better this way.	Ðewohĩ anyo wu le mɔ sia nu.
A year from now we will have a new car.	Ƒe ɖeka megbe la, ʋu yeye aɖe anɔ mía si.
You have to be united.	Ele be nàwɔ ɖeka.
I was there for a week, four summers ago.	Menɔ afima kwasiɖa ɖeka, dzomeŋɔli ene enye sia.
The people in the room looked at each other.	Ame siwo nɔ xɔa me la lé ŋku ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
If there was a problem, the police came quickly.	Ne kuxi aɖe do mo ɖa la, kpovitɔwo va kaba.
It would certainly make sense.	Susu anɔ eme godoo.
But everything else seems to be good news.	Gake edze abe nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nye nya nyui ene.
He probably bought them clothes too.	Anɔ eme be eya hã ƒle awu na wo.
I don’t know what it is.	Nyemenya nusi wònye o.
Running away from too much.	Esi le nu geɖe akpa me.
That has changed, slightly.	Ema trɔ, vie.
It’s a difficult issue.	Enye nya sesẽ aɖe.
You told us that.	Wòe gblɔ nya ma na mí.
I sat in my car.	Menɔ anyi ɖe nye ʋu me.
I don’t know you either.	Nye hã nyemenya wò o.
But he was just a nice guy, a really nice guy.	Gake ŋutsu nyui aɖe koe wònye, ŋutsu nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Look at the hair on his neck.	Lé ŋku ɖe ɖa si le eƒe kɔ ŋu la ŋu.
I asked for his name.	Mebia eƒe ŋkɔ.
That just means so much to us.	Ðeko ema fia nu geɖe ŋutɔ na mí.
It feels like a summer afternoon right now.	Ewɔ nam abe dzomeŋɔli ƒe ŋdɔ me fifia ene.
But it doesn't seem to be working.	Gake edze abe mele dɔ wɔm o ene.
I really enjoyed the whole season.	Ɣeyiɣi bliboa katã do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
I just couldn’t get over it.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ɖu edzi o.
It’s not a part of it.	Menye eƒe akpa aɖee o.
These songs are in your mind.	Ha siawo le susu me na wò.
You don’t know where you are.	Mènya afi si nèle o.
But it’s really not that complicated.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, menye nusi me kɔ nenema gbegbe o.
Who wouldn’t?.	Amekae mawɔe o?.
I saw that once.	Mekpɔ ema zi ɖeka.
No one can doubt that.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu ake ɖi nya ma o.
An idea whose time has come.	Susu aɖe si ƒe ɣeyiɣi de.
That was nearly a year ago.	Ema nye ƒe ɖeka kloe enye sia.
A small town.	Du sue aɖe.
You can do what you want with it.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu si nèdi kplii.
I didn’t mind that much that people laughed.	Meɖe fu nam nenema gbegbe be amewo ko nu o.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
He wasn't going to change his mind.	Menye ɖe wònɔ eƒe susu trɔ ge o.
At the same time, nothing was the same.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me la, naneke menɔ abe tsã ene o.
I don’t know any better.	Nyemenya nu bubu aɖeke wu ema o.
No one had a name.	Ŋkɔ menɔ ame aɖeke si o.
You’re never going home.	Mèle aƒeme yim gbeɖe o.
Please allow me to explain.	Taflatse ɖe mɔ nam maɖe eme.
I have a good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖe le asinye.
Now, it was when he was ready.	Fifia, enye esime wònɔ klalo.
The people who live there the people who do.	Ame siwo nɔa afima ame siwo wɔa nu.
The entirety of this section .	Akpa sia ƒe akpa bliboa .
It’s very clear.	Eme kɔ nyuie.
I can’t know you.	Nyemate ŋu anya wò o.
I desperately needed the money.	Mehiã ga la vevie.
It couldn’t be simpler.	Mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe wu ema o.
Last night was the first.	Zã si va yi ye nye gbãtɔ.
It’s a bad idea.	Susu gbegblẽ aɖee.
I survived, too.	Nye hã metsi agbe.
I had to push myself hard just to keep going.	Ele be maƒo ɖokuinye sesĩe be mayi edzi ko.
In that aspect, it’s easier.	Le akpa ma me la, ele bɔbɔe wu.
Everyone tried to move forward.	Amesiame dze agbagba be yeayi ŋgɔ.
His eyes were on her.	Eƒe ŋku nɔ eŋu.
You expect little more than that.	Èle mɔ kpɔm na nu sue aɖe ko wu ema.
Live the life.	Nɔ agbe la.
He didn’t know what month it was.	Menya ɣleti si wònye o.
Just to test you.	Be mado wò kpɔ ko.
But this isn’t working.	Gake esia mele dɔ wɔm o.
Too close together.	Te ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu akpa.
I would have an issue with them.	Nya aɖe anɔ asinye kpli wo.
But many people did.	Gake ame geɖe wɔe nenema.
I’m glad I did that.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mewɔe nenema.
I refused to have anything.	Megbe be naneke manɔ asinye o.
We can talk about anything.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu tso nusianu ŋu.
It’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Which is probably a mistake.	Nusi anya nye vodada.
This lasted for months.	Esia nɔ anyi ɣleti geɖe.
We don’t know what to do.	Míenya nusi míawɔ o.
And that worked for them.	Eye ema wɔ dɔ na wo.
Get your entire foot wet.	Na wò afɔ bliboa ƒo tsi.
Wear something warm.	Do nane si me dzo le.
Time never existed.	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
I can handle things from here.	Mate ŋu akpɔ nuwo gbɔ tso afisia.
Or anywhere near you.	Alo teƒe ɖesiaɖe si te ɖe ŋuwò.
And another, and another.	Eye bubu, kple bubu.
But only a few days before.	Gake ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe do ŋgɔ nɛ.
Just a little bit of difficulty.	Sesẽ aɖe ko.
He was a good guy.	Ame nyui aɖee wònye.
They all work now.	Wo katã wɔa dɔ fifia.
I don’t think money changed hands here either.	Nyemesusu be ga trɔ asi le afisia hã o.
I would like you to have this.	Madi be esia nanɔ asiwò.
There are all these little things.	Nu sue siawo katã li.
But this was more than any of them had ever seen.	Gake esia sɔ gbɔ wu esi wo dometɔ aɖeke kpɔ kpɔ.
I want to get to know you better.	Medi be manya wò nyuie wu.
I just did that.	Ðeko mewɔe nenema.
The real issue here is another.	Nya ŋutɔŋutɔ si le afisia hã nye bubu.
He couldn’t wait.	Mete ŋu nɔ lalam o.
That explained it.	Ema ɖe eme.
In another lifetime.	Le agbe bubu me.
Nothing was the same.	Naneke menɔ abe tsã ene o.
Not at all.	Menye nenema kura o.
I got this one.	Mexɔ esia.
There could be several reasons for this.	Susu geɖe ate ŋu anɔ esia ta.
It’s not a good thing.	Menye nu nyui aɖeke o.
You know exactly why.	Ènya nusita wòle nenema nyuie.
He began to think about death.	Edze ku ŋu bubu gɔme.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
First time, last time.	Zi gbãtɔ, zi mamlɛtɔ.
I felt comfortable with the interior of my car.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye ʋua ƒe akpa si le xɔa me la na nye dzi dze eme.
I definitely felt that way.	Mese le ɖokuinye me nenema godoo.
I mentioned your name.	Megblɔ wò ŋkɔ.
I tried them several times.	Mete wo kpɔ zi geɖe.
I had a lot of problems with that.	Kuxi geɖe nɔ ŋunye le nya ma ŋu.
Stay true to who you are.	Nɔ ame si nènye la me ɖe asi.
Do whatever you have to do.	Wɔ nusianu si wòle be nàwɔ.
He was in a good mood.	Eƒe susu nɔ nu ŋu nyuie.
This isn’t surprising.	Esia mewɔ nuku o.
Its just me that’s it.	Eƒe nye koe nye ema.
That’s definitely something new.	Ema nye nu yeye godoo.
There is so much work to be done here.	Dɔ geɖe ŋutɔ li woawɔ le afisia.
The work is very difficult.	Dɔa sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Focus on the present.	Lé fɔ ɖe fifia ŋu.
Face the reality.	Dze ŋgɔ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ la.
That’s not surprising.	Ema mewɔ nuku o.
I’ll be happy to say anything you want, you know.	Adzɔ dzi nam be magblɔ nya sia nya si nèdi, ènya.
He’s been trying for years, man.	Edze agbagba ƒe geɖe, ŋutsu.
At least in this school.	Le suku sia ya teti me.
But it seems unlikely.	Gake edze abe ɖe mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.
That’s the good thing about this.	Emae nye nu nyui si le esia ŋu.
But people are kind.	Gake amewo nyo dɔme.
He couldn’t control his temper at all.	Mete ŋu ɖu eƒe dziku dzi kura o.
Who no one wants.	Ame si ame aɖeke medi o.
There are few things he enjoys more.	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe doa dzidzɔ nɛ wu.
The truth is a bit different.	Nyateƒea to vovo vie.
This is a bad idea.	Esia nye susu gbegblẽ aɖe.
I was the right age for that.	Menye ƒe si sɔ na ema.
And yet, none of them had ever been there for him.	Eye ke hã, wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ afima nɛ kpɔ o.
I would rather do anything else.	Anyo nam wu be mawɔ nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
That just means more time.	Ðeko ema fia be ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu nanɔ anyi.
You are working too hard.	Èle dɔ wɔm sesĩe akpa.
But there is nothing he can do.	Gake naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ o.
That’s what’s going to happen.	Emae nye nusi adzɔ.
But this day had been completely wrong.	Gake ŋkeke sia nye nu gbegblẽ kura tsã.
He wasn’t surprised there.	Mewɔ nuku nɛ le afima o.
Stay that way.	Nɔ nenema.
As if there is only one book.	Abe ɖe agbalẽ ɖeka koe li ene.
However, more difficult situations may arise.	Ke hã, nɔnɔme siwo sesẽ wu ate ŋu adzɔ.
I think something is going on.	Mesusu be nane le edzi yim.
I have told you the truth.	Megblɔ nyateƒea na mi.
This is quite a lot.	Esia sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
Think about your dog.	Bu wò avu ŋu kpɔ.
I’m a part of him, he’s a part of me.	Nyee nye eƒe akpa aɖe, eya hã nye nye akpa aɖe.
I was nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
It’s probably just something someone else left there.	Anɔ eme be nane si ame bubu gblẽ ɖe afima koe wònye.
So was everything else.	Nenema ke nu bubu ɖesiaɖe hã nɔ.
Say more about them.	Gblɔ nya geɖe tso wo ŋu.
This time, it will happen.	Fifia ya la, adzɔ.
In fact, he didn’t order me out at all.	Le nyateƒe me la, meɖe gbe nam kura be mado go o.
Nothing was right.	Naneke menɔ nyuie o.
This is a very good thing for us in this regard.	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ na mí le go sia me.
Everything is expensive these days.	Nusianu xɔ asi le ŋkeke siawo me.
But it’s not surprising.	Gake mewɔ nuku o.
However, we can work on that.	Ke hã, míate ŋu awɔ dɔ tso ema ŋu.
He somehow made his way back.	Ewɔ eƒe mɔ trɔ gbɔ le mɔ aɖe nu.
Could he have done that.	Ðe wòate ŋu awɔe nenema.
What is that name?	Ŋkɔ kae nye ema?
You can count on that.	Àte ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe ema ŋu.
Life is still good.	Agbe gakpɔtɔ nyo.
That will continue to be the case.	Nenema ayi edzi anɔ alea.
Few of us are enough.	Mía dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe sɔ gbɔ.
Almost no one doubted the outcome.	Ame aɖeke kloe meke ɖi le nusi ado tso eme ŋu o.
You've been working on it for a long time.	Èle dɔ wɔm tso eŋu ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I apologize in the past.	Meɖe kuku le tsã.
We’re going to do it.	Míele ewɔ ge.
It’s just that way.	Ðeko wòle nenema.
It just doesn’t work that way.	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
You're going to die.	Èle kuku ge.
He couldn’t run anything.	Mete ŋu ƒu du naneke o.
What.	Nu ka.
However, that is definitely not true.	Ke hã, nya ma menye nyateƒe godoo o.
I was the closest.	Nyee nye amesi te ɖe ŋunye wu.
What is the most difficult part?	Akpa kae sesẽ wu?
I know it seems like a lot.	Menya be edze abe nu geɖe ŋutɔ ene.
It is very true to a very large extent.	Enye nyateƒe ŋutɔ vaseɖe afi aɖe ŋutɔ.
However, this cannot be true.	Ke hã, esia mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
I couldn’t think of anything else.	Nyemete ŋu bu nu bubu aɖeke ŋu o.
I didn’t recognize the building.	Nyemekpɔ xɔa dze sii o.
But there are always a few things there.	Gake nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔa afima ɣesiaɣi.
No one could do it.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu wɔe o.
There is nothing like it.	Naneke meli si sɔ kplii o.
I'll explain tomorrow.	Maɖe eme etsɔ.
It was a great deal of fun.	Enye dzidzɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Sue thought about it.	Sue bu eŋu.
But, a house.	Gake, aƒe aɖe.
In contrast, no serious complications occurred.	To vovo na esia la, kuxi sesẽ aɖeke medo mo ɖa o.
That worked great.	Ema wɔ dɔ ŋutɔ.
He could not bear this.	Mete ŋu do dzi le esia me o.
Look at several reasons.	Lé ŋku ɖe susu geɖe ŋu.
It was everyone who worked for him.	Enye amesiame si wɔ dɔ nɛ.
Now that’s just me.	Fifia ya nye koe nye ema.
Turn on the heat.	Do dzo ɖe edzi.
In fact, it is not at all.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele nenema kura o.
I couldn’t wait to get out of this place.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ mɔ kpɔm be mado le teƒe sia o.
This is a really, really good book.	Esia nye agbalẽ nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Impossible.	Mate ŋu adzɔ o.
If you have money, people will want you.	Ne ga le asiwò la, amewo adi wò.
This is a serious mistake.	Esia nye vodada gã aɖe.
He can understand that much.	Ate ŋu ase egɔme nenema gbegbe.
Go back there.	Trɔ yi afima.
This is in a new era.	Esia le ɣeyiɣi yeye aɖe me.
I know so many people.	Menya ame geɖe ŋutɔ.
I think they are.	Mesusu be wole nenema.
His face was wrong.	Eƒe mo nye nu gbegblẽ.
Many of us were deeply impressed.	Mía dometɔ geɖe ƒe nu lé dzi nɛ vevie.
Perhaps, they are connected by a word.	Ðewohĩ, nya aɖee ƒoa wo nu ƒu.
But he can’t just go out there with what he has.	Gake mate ŋu ado go le afima ko kple esi le esi o.
That would be fine, the teacher said.	Ema anyo, nufiala la gblɔ.
This could be anything.	Esia ate ŋu anye nusianu.
Make way for that.	Wɔ mɔ ɖe ema ŋu.
And we really can’t go anywhere.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, míate ŋu ayi afi aɖeke o.
The car came quickly.	Ʋua va kaba.
These two fought each other.	Ame eve siawo wɔ avu kple wo nɔewo.
He won’t talk to anyone.	Maƒo nu na ame aɖeke o.
You don’t have to do anything more.	Mehiã be nàwɔ naneke wu ema o.
It’s like that.	Ele nenema.
I can do that, no problem.	Mate ŋu awɔ ema, kuxi aɖeke meli o.
However, he couldn’t score.	Ke hã, mete ŋu ƒo go o.
On the other hand.	Le go bubu me la.
He had some great ideas.	Susu gã aɖewo nɔ esi.
Too many people.	Ame geɖe akpa.
I do this for a couple of reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae mewɔa esia ɖo.
The car broke down twice while on the road.	Ʋua gblẽ zi eve esime wònɔ mɔ dzi.
But now you know it’s not that easy.	Gake fifia ènya be mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
What a name that is	Ŋkɔ kae nye ema .
You have to do what you did.	Ele be nàwɔ nu si nèwɔ.
That’s for another time.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖe ta.
Mine is just small.	Nye tɔ le sue ko.
That made me feel weird, but in a good way.	Ema na mese le ɖokuinye me be mewɔ nuku, gake le mɔ nyui aɖe nu.
Logically, it will eventually happen.	Susu le eme be ava eme mlɔeba.
As they work on you.	Esi wole dɔ wɔm tso ŋuwò.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
Until that hour, anything is possible.	Vaseɖe gaƒoƒo ma me la, nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
I would have something else.	Nu bubu aɖe anɔ asinye.
This result was surprising.	Nusi do tso eme sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It wasn’t anything at all.	Menye naneke kura o.
I knew it would be cheap.	Menya be anye nusi mexɔ asi o.
I'll see you.	Makpɔ wò.
I can’t say anything yet.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke haɖe o.
This has happened in many cases.	Esia dzɔ le go geɖe me.
I know that all too well.	Menya nya ma nyuie ŋutɔ.
This became more difficult.	Esia va sesẽ wu.
I don’t think it would be that much more complicated.	Nyemesusu be anye nusi me kɔ wu nenema gbegbe o.
Someone was calling him.	Ame aɖe nɔ ka ƒom nɛ.
We are alive.	Míele agbe.
There is no word for this.	Nya aɖeke meli na esia o.
He doesn't expect any problems.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na kuxi aɖeke o.
No one came near him.	Ame aɖeke mete ɖe eŋu o.
He hopes to find a better job.	Ele mɔ kpɔm be yeakpɔ dɔ si nyo wu.
His car broke down.	Eƒe ʋua gblẽ.
But it doesn’t seem like it, right now.	Gake medze abe ɖe wòle ene o, fifia.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Everything	Nu ɖesiaɖe
You just couldn’t do it.	Wò ɖeka koe mete ŋui o.
I was so glad I was tired.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be ɖeɖi te ŋunye.
But everyone has it.	Gake ame sia ame ya le esi.
I can see them all now.	Mete ŋu kpɔa wo katã fifia.
I want to do more.	Medi be mawɔ geɖe wu.
But this part .	Gake akpa sia .
I needed that book.	Mehiã agbalẽ ma.
The room was suddenly warm.	Xɔa me xɔ dzo zi ɖeka.
That’s why he was in office for so long.	Esia tae wònɔ zi dzi ɣeyiɣi didi nenema ɖo.
Only, he didn’t have enough time.	Ðeko, ɣeyiɣi si sɔ menɔ esi o.
Either he needs surgery or he doesn’t.	Ehiã be woawɔ dɔ nɛ alo mehiã o.
And some of us are here today.	Eye mía dometɔ aɖewo le afisia egbea.
It had seemed a little strange.	Edze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku vie ene tsã.
In this section.	Le akpa sia me.
It can be the same for you.	Ate ŋu anɔ nenema ke na wò hã.
He didn't seem to care that much.	Edze abe metsɔ ɖeke le eme nenema gbegbe o ene.
He really did a great job.	Ewɔ dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He never asked for anything for himself.	Mebia naneke na eɖokui kpɔ o.
Not on its own.	Menye le eɖokui si o.
If anything happens, it will happen now.	Ne nane dzɔ la, adzɔ fifia.
He didn’t understand.	Mese egɔme o.
He didn’t see anything.	Mekpɔ naneke o.
No one was working.	Ame aɖeke menɔ dɔ wɔm o.
Maybe it will come out soon.	Ðewohĩ ava do kaba.
That has its own reality.	Ema ŋutɔ ƒe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ le esi.
A lot of cars came by.	Ʋu geɖe va to afima.
He will be coming to us.	Anɔ mía gbɔ gbɔna.
A house is a house.	Aƒe nye aƒe.
This is a serious mistake.	Esia nye vodada gã aɖe.
Not for them.	Menye na wo o.
Good news for me.	Nya nyui aɖe nam.
You can’t fight them.	Màte ŋu awɔ avu kpli wo o.
Not a fun part of this job.	Menye dɔ sia ƒe akpa aɖe si doa dzidzɔ na ame o.
And it worked, finally.	Eye ewɔ dɔ, mlɔeba.
He has a name.	Ŋkɔ le esi.
I'm on the road.	Mele mɔ dzi.
Maybe someone knows more.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe nya nu geɖe wu.
Time to do the right thing.	Ɣeyiɣi si me woawɔ nu si sɔ.
You the you.	Tu la tu.
But it doesn’t look like him, not really.	Gake medze abe eya ene o, menye nenema tututu o.
Are you there.	Ele afi ma.
I couldn’t let go of it.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe asi le eŋu o.
Ha ha, this seems like a fun little thing.	Ha ha, esia dze abe nu sue aɖe si doa dzidzɔ na ame ene.
This doesn’t make sense either though.	Susu mele esia hã me o ke hã.
What a great idea.	Susu gã kae nye si.
That’s what’s going on.	Emae le edzi yim.
Right there on the thing.	Afima tututu le nu la dzi.
It’s something you want to work on.	Enye nusi ŋu nèdi be yeawɔ dɔ ɖo.
Over and over and over again.	Zi gbɔ zi geɖe kple zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
Everything is so dead.	Nusianu ku ale gbegbe.
Maybe it would be best if he didn’t say anything.	Ðewohĩ anyo wu ne megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
This is very expensive.	Esia xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
One person heard nothing.	Ame ɖeka mese naneke o.
Not so much as it is.	Menye nenema gbegbe o.
I still can’t get over them.	Nyemete ŋu le wo dzi ɖum kokoko o.
This may happen more rarely than one would like.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ ƒã wu alesi ame aɖe adi.
Maybe a year.	Ðewohĩ ƒe ɖeka.
The truth lives through us.	Nyateƒe la nɔa agbe to mía dzi.
He wasn’t the only one who remembered it.	Menye eya ɖeka koe ɖo ŋku edzi o.
That would be a great thing.	Ema anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But maybe you can help me.	Gake ɖewohĩ àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
Think about it, just think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ, bu eŋu kpɔ ko.
This new model is amazing.	Mɔ̃ yeye sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
The same is true of	Nenema ke wòle le .
I finally let him go.	Meɖe asi le eŋu mlɔeba.
Just like real life.	Abe agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
And it’s going well.	Eye wòle edzi yim nyuie.
I saved his life.	Meɖe eƒe agbe.
That seems pretty interesting.	Edze abe nya ma doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ ene.
He seemed unsatisfied.	Edze abe eƒe dzi medze eme o ene.
Many cars were still working.	Ʋu geɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ dɔ wɔm.
Like something was wrong with me.	Abe nane gblẽ le ŋunye ene.
And to some extent it is.	Eye vaseɖe afi aɖe la, ele nenema.
But overall, things went well.	Gake le nusianu me la, nuwo yi edzi nyuie.
I don’t know what to do now.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ fifia o.
I don’t know what it is.	Nyemenya nusi wònye o.
It's a disjointed thing.	Enye nusi mewɔ ɖeka kple wo nɔewo o.
Summer is hot.	Dzomeŋɔli xɔa dzo.
That’s not what happened, of course.	Menye emae dzɔ ya o.
Which ends right there.	Nusi wu enu le afima tututu.
The apartment was comfortable.	Xɔa me nɔ nyuie.
However, we had two problems.	Ke hã, kuxi eve nɔ mía ŋu.
How many hours are you planning to work each week?	Gaƒoƒo nenie nèle ɖoɖo wɔm be yeawɔ dɔ kwasiɖa sia kwasiɖa?
I had to do everything myself.	Ele be nye ŋutɔ mawɔ nusianu.
There is nothing quite like it.	Naneke meli si sɔ kple esia tututu o.
Which is the closest.	Nukae te ɖe eŋu wu.
I have doubts about this.	Meke ɖi le esia ŋu.
I used to be in that situation myself.	Nye ŋutɔ menɔ nɔnɔme ma me tsã.
Someone wasn’t treating him right.	Ame aɖe menɔ nu wɔm ɖe eŋu nyuie o.
I have no more words for you.	Nya aɖeke megale asinye na wò o.
A year has passed.	Ƒe ɖeka va yi.
How surprised we were.	Aleke gbegbe wòwɔ nuku na mí enye si.
But he had one real chance.	Gake mɔnukpɔkpɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ ɖeka nɔ esi.
Perhaps you are the type.	Ðewohĩ wòe nye amesi ƒomevi.
That is obviously not possible now.	Edze ƒã be ema manya wɔ fifia o.
But this road is too long.	Gake mɔ sia didi akpa.
That’s his job.	Emae nye eƒe dɔ.
I have to get out of this city.	Ele be mado le du sia me.
However, this doesn’t work.	Ke hã, esia mewɔa dɔ o.
Excited! 	Kpɔ dzidzɔ!
We just have it today.	Ðeko wòle mía si egbea.
I never expected that to happen.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be nu ma ava eme kpɔ o.
Accurate.	De.
This case is currently being worked on here.	Wole dɔ wɔm tso nya sia ŋu le afisia fifia.
I want to say that.	Medi be magblɔ be.
The work is too dry.	Dɔa ƒu akpa.
That’s not a new thing.	Ema menye nu yeye o.
But last summer, something clicked.	Gake le ƒe si va yi ƒe dzomeŋɔli me la, nane ƒo.
The first time he did this, he made a serious mistake.	Zi gbãtɔ si wòwɔ esia la, ewɔ vodada vevie.
But are they really.	Gake ɖe wole nyateƒea.
Please stand back.	Meɖe kuku, tsi tre ɖe megbe.
Which is a bad thing.	Nusi nye nu gbegblẽ.
That has never been true.	Ema menye nyateƒe kpɔ o.
I can’t say I met him.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ be medo go o.
I'm the best.	Nye si nyo wu.
He couldn’t understand it himself.	Eya ŋutɔ mete ŋu se egɔme o.
Life is so precious!	Agbe xɔ asi ŋutɔ!
A bad hole too.	Do gbegblẽ aɖe hã.
But this mistake is a bit different.	Gake vodada sia to vovo vie.
However, there are a few problems.	Ke hã, kuxi ʋɛ aɖewo li.
It has two distinct sides.	Akpa eve siwo to vovo le eŋu.
No gun yet.	Tu aɖeke meli haɖe o.
This shouldn’t be surprising.	Mele be esia nawɔ nuku o.
It’s a big deal at the moment.	Enye nu gã aɖe le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
Long term may be a long time to come.	Ɣeyiɣi didi ate ŋu anye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe si gbɔna.
He is moving forward.	Ele ŋgɔ yim ɖo ta.
He can’t get a job.	Mate ŋu akpɔ dɔ o.
It’s something else.	Enye nu bubu aɖe.
Finally, the car came to a halt.	Mlɔeba la, ʋua va tɔ.
I know what he wants.	Menya nusi dim wòle.
In this case, it didn’t.	Le go sia me la, mewɔe nenema o.
You can eat whenever you want.	Àte ŋu aɖu nu ɣesiaɣi si nèdi.
Think he was shocked.	Bu eŋu be eƒe nu ku ŋutɔ.
I can’t understand anything after that.	Nyemate ŋu ase naneke gɔme le ema megbe o.
No one will ever know that.	Ame aɖeke manya nya ma gbeɖe o.
I have a name.	Ŋkɔ le asinye.
Please take care of that.	Taflatse kpɔ ema gbɔ.
No one told me it would be like this.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nam be anɔ alea o.
The problem is very busy.	Kuxi bubu kura.
I am going through the truth.	Mele nyateƒe me tom.
I will make one as soon as possible.	Mawɔ ɖeka kaba ale si mate ŋui.
Summer can’t take anything else.	Dzomeŋɔli mate ŋu axɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
Some of that is going on.	Ema dometɔ aɖewo le edzi yim.
It’s really amazing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
His hand is on her hand.	Eƒe asi le eƒe asi dzi.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Nyemenya nu si le fu ɖem nam o.
There isn’t much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke meli o.
What we will do in the past.	Nusi míawɔ va yi.
This should be done differently.	Ele be woawɔ esia le mɔ bubu nu.
I am looking forward to it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie.
More work than any of us can do.	Dɔ geɖe wu mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe si ate ŋu awɔ.
I’m glad he’s not in that.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mele ema me o.
That’s what my whole thing is.	Emae nye nu si nye nya bliboa nye.
No one seems to know much about it.	Edze abe ame aɖeke menya nu geɖe tso eŋu o ene.
That ended with.	Ema wu enu kple.
He wasn’t there.	Menɔ afima o.
It’s a minor problem.	Enye kuxi sue aɖe.
For the sake of one day.	Le ŋkeke ɖeka ta.
We are not important enough.	Míele vevie ale gbegbe o.
He wouldn’t talk at all.	Maƒo nu kura o.
It’s really clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Died right here and no one ever showed up.	Ðe ku le afisia tututu eye ame aɖeke meva kpɔ o.
This used to be a good idea.	Esia nye susu nyui aɖe tsã.
The two opposing sides collided.	Akpa eve siwo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu la dze wo nɔewo dzi.
They are right.	Wole eteƒe.
He was going to throw his life away.	Ele eƒe agbe tsɔ ge ƒu gbe.
Go ahead, quickly.	Yi edzi, kaba.
There was a lot of work.	Dɔ geɖe nɔ anyi.
Almost everyone laughed.	Amesiame kloe ko nu.
Only two cars passed us on the highway.	Ʋu eve koe to mía ŋu le mɔ gã la dzi.
It is something that will stay with us.	Enye nane si anɔ mía ŋu.
At this time of the year.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
When money is involved, things often get weird.	Ne ga le eme la, zi geɖe la, nuwo va wɔa nuku.
It didn’t do much for me, though.	Mewɔ nu geɖe nam o, gake.
It was a wonderful place.	Enye teƒe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I lost my job.	Nye dɔa bu.
Again, there is much to be done.	Le afisia hã la, nu geɖe li woawɔ.
Thank you in advance.	Akpe na mi do ŋgɔ.
But that might not work.	Gake ɖewohĩ ema maɖe vi o.
With this book.	Kple agbalẽ sia.
There could be a few reasons.	Susu ʋɛ aɖewo ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
We know this is not true.	Míenya be esia menye nyateƒe o.
Strong place, that.	Teƒe sesẽ, be.
That it will be a long time.	Be anye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
In fact, there is no life in it.	Le nyateƒe me la, agbe mele eme o.
For now, that’s enough.	Fifia ya, ema sɔ gbɔ.
There is none of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
The one with the life.	Ame si me agbe le la.

If it does happen.	Ne edzɔ la.
You can stay.	Àte ŋu anɔ anyi.
I prayed out loud that night.	Medo gbe ɖa sesĩe le zã ma me.
The king finally left.	Fia la dzo mlɔeba.
Sprinkle with salt.	Tsɔ dze ƒo ɖe eme.
He was very attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
A gun went off.	Tu aɖe ɖi.
Everyone is fine.	Amesiame le nyuie.
I really wanted to.	Medi vevie ŋutɔ.
Unlike one man.	To vovo na ŋutsu ɖeka.
One last point.	Nya mamlɛtɔ ɖeka.
It was a good enough plan.	Enye ɖoɖo nyui aɖe si sɔ gbɔ.
It didn’t bother me at all.	Meɖe fu nam kura o.
More life in the room.	Agbe geɖe wu le xɔa me.
He fought hard.	Ewɔ avu vevie.
The project is perfect for this project.	Dɔa sɔ nyuie na dɔ sia.
I’ve seen my town change and I’m with it.	Mekpɔ nye du la trɔ eye nye hã mele eŋu.
Everyone is in each.	Ame sia ame le ɖesiaɖe me.
It’s simple but really innovative.	Ele bɔbɔe gake enye nu yeye ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It would make more sense.	Susu anɔ eme wu.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
But it is, in part.	Gake ele nenema, le eƒe akpa aɖe me.
Every night is different.	Zã ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
That will make your job a lot easier.	Ema ana wò dɔa nanɔ bɔbɔe na wò ŋutɔ.
He gave everything.	Etsɔ nusianu na.
Actually, I have it.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele asinye.
It was amazing what people threw away.	Nu siwo amewo tsɔ ƒu gbe la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He couldn't feel anything.	Mete ŋu se naneke le eɖokui me o.
There was no one there to help them.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima akpe ɖe wo ŋu o.
The near future is this year.	Ɣeyiɣi si gbɔna kpuie enye ƒe sia me.
That was hard, but it worked.	Ema sesẽ, gake ewɔ dɔ.
We don’t know what it is.	Míenya nusi wònye o.
I was ready to do something.	Menɔ klalo be mawɔ nane.
I doubt many did.	Meke ɖi be ame geɖe wɔe nenema.
Maybe, just maybe.	Ðewohĩ, ɖewohĩ ko.
This thing is not included either.	Nu sia hã mele eme o.
He just doesn't care now.	Ðeko metsɔ ɖeke le eme fifia o.
People know very little about it.	Amewo nya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o.
Show some life.	Ðe agbe aɖewo fia.
Waiting for me to come out.	Le lalam be mado go.
That’s pretty amazing, too.	Ema hã wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Honestly, I’ve never seen anything quite like it.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemekpɔ naneke si sɔ kple esia tututu kpɔ o.
But he is not here now, and you are here.	Gake mele afisia fifia o, eye wò hã nèle afisia.
I was definitely focused on it.	Nye susu nɔ eŋu godoo.

No one had ever heard of them.	Ame aɖeke mese wo ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
Throughout the year.	Le ƒe bliboa me.
I only came across one issue.	Nya ɖeka koe meva do go.
Take a little break.	Gbɔ ɖe eme vie.
A hole appeared very quickly.	Do aɖe do kaba ŋutɔ.
Or kill them.	Alo wu wo.
He wouldn’t let go.	Maɖe asi le eŋu o.
Please help me out.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye mado go.
I have never been able to see that.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nu ma kpɔ o.
I said something.	Megblɔ nya aɖe.
He can't do anything about how it is.	Mate ŋu awɔ naneke le alesi wòle ŋu o.
Head at home.	Ta le aƒeme.
I enjoy doing that.	Ema wɔwɔ dzɔa dzi nam.
That should be easy to do.	Ele be ema wɔwɔ nanɔ bɔbɔe.
I am convinced of that.	Meka ɖe nya ma dzi.
That would be the last one.	Emae anye mamlɛtɔ.
They’re in each other’s heads.	Wole wo nɔewo ƒe ta me.
Look at who he is.	Kpɔ amesi wònye ɖa.
Things got worse.	Nuwo va gblẽ ɖe edzi.
In fact, it is something.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye nu aɖe.
Some things are just not on us anymore.	Ðeko nu aɖewo megale mía dzi o.
I'm trying to warm up.	Mele agbagba dzem be mado dzo.
Which is very simple.	Nusi le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I had to step up though.	Ele be maɖe afɔ gake.
I was too late.	Metsi megbe akpa.
This kind of thing can’t go on.     	Nu sia ƒomevi mate ŋu ayi edzi o.

This has never been a problem for us.	Esia menye kuxi na mí kpɔ o.
He deserves the job.	Edze na dɔa wɔwɔ.
Be careful with that.	Kpɔ nyuie le ema ŋu.
I have absolutely no idea what to do about it.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso eŋu kura o.
Some of them have things there.	Nuwo le wo dometɔ aɖewo si le afima.
My exact idea of ​​a good time.	Nye susu tututu le ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe ŋu.
For if that.	Na nenye be.
I don’t know how to say anything real.	Nyemenya alesi magblɔ nya ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke o.
You know some of them.	Ènya wo dometɔ aɖewo.
This isn’t the only one.	Menye esia koe nye esia o.
I wondered how he got on that path.	Mebia ɖokuinye be aleke wòwɔ va ɖo mɔ ma dzi hã.
It’s a day for this.	Enye ŋkeke aɖe na esia.
He will get out of this.	Ado le esia me.
Many cities have disappeared over the years.	Du geɖe bu le ƒe siwo va yi me.
It seems like a real person and someone else is speaking.	Edze abe ame ŋutɔŋutɔ kple ame bubu aɖee le nu ƒom ene.
And that child, too.	Eye ɖevi ma hã.
My name is not there.	Nye ŋkɔ mele afima o.
And here’s another reason.	Eye susu bubu aɖee nye esi.
I wasn’t too upset about it.	Medo dziku nam akpa le eŋu o.
However, it doesn’t matter.	Ke hã, mele vevie o.
Let’s do the right thing.	Mina míawɔ nu si sɔ.
It was as if my hand could reach farther.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe nye asi ate ŋu aɖo afisi didi wu ene.
No one cares about that.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le ema me o.
Come on, you know what’s going on.	Va, ènya nusi le edzi yim.
I don’t know what else to do.	Nyemenya nu bubu si mawɔ o.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
But there was nothing.	Gake naneke menɔ anyi o.
His life, his work .	Eƒe agbe, eƒe dɔ .
I'm running soon.	Mele du dzi kpuie.
Now he is sick.	Fifia edze dɔ.
I'm still waiting, actually.	Megale lalam kokoko, le nyateƒe me.
Which works well.	Nusi wɔa dɔ nyuie.
I think you’re too light on it all.	Mesusu be èle bɔbɔe akpa le wo katã ŋu.
You are who you are and that is that.	Wòe nye amesi nènye eye emae nye ema.
Throw that away.	Tsɔ ema ƒu gbe.
This will always be you.	Esia anye wò ɣesiaɣi.
And it often is.	Eye zi geɖe la, ele nenema.
In the same year in fact.	Le ƒe ma ke me le nyateƒe me.
I would be very happy.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I can’t take anything else.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
This is not easy at all.	Esia mele bɔbɔe kura o.
A few weeks here may do you some good.	Kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo le afisia ate ŋu aɖe vi aɖewo na wò.
I don’t think it’s a plan for doing that.	Nyemesusu be menye ɖoɖo aɖee wònye na ema wɔwɔ o.
I didn’t get to go because of time.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ ayi le ɣeyiɣi ta o.
This wasn’t doing any good.	Esia menɔ nyui aɖeke wɔm o.
I felt alive.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mele agbe.
It is not unreasonable.	Menye nusi me susu mele o ye o.
Another week passed.	Kwasiɖa bubu aɖe va yi.
He was obviously sick.	Edze ƒã be edze dɔ.
That sounds offensive.	Ema ɖi nusi doa dziku na ame.
We are not expecting anything.	Míele mɔ kpɔm na naneke o.
It’s really simple.	Enye nu bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
My mind is clear.	Nye susu me kɔ.
I got a couple of reasons.	Mekpɔ susu eve aɖewo ta.
That’s a very good thing.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ.
It happened during the day.	Edzɔ le ŋkeke me.
He needs a bone.	Ehiã ƒu.
No one wants this.	Ame aɖeke medi esia o.
His little face fell.	Eƒe mo sue la dze anyi.
Several people died in the resulting fire.	Ame geɖe ku le dzo si do tso eme la me.
This is impossible, mountain.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o, to.
I think that means something.	Mesusu be ema fia nane.
We shouldn’t have done that.	Mele be míawɔ nu ma hafi o.
I knew he would do that.	Menya be awɔe nenema.
And a really long way.	Eye mɔ didi aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That started things off.	Emae dze nuwo gɔme.
He is alive for us.	Ele agbe na mí.
I couldn’t form a clear idea.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ susu si me kɔ o.
But that’s all the point.	Gake nya la koe nye ema.
Please consider this when ordering during these times.	Taflatse bu esia ŋu ne èle nu biam le ɣeyiɣi siawo me.
There was another person in the house.	Ame bubu aɖe hã nɔ aƒea me.
I'd be a little more interested in what's there.	Adzɔ dzi nam vie wu nusi le afima.
However, there are some reasons.	Ke hã, susu aɖewo le eme.
Nothing works here.	Naneke mewɔa dɔ le afisia o.
You just never know.	Ðeko mènya gbeɖe o.
What a reason for this.	Susu kae nye si.
He would like one of these.	Adi be nya siawo dometɔ aɖee.
He had time for everyone.	Ɣeyiɣi nɔ esi na amesiame.
Look at us.	Kpɔ mí ɖa.
It’s just here.	Afi sia koe li.
Or from here.	Alo tso afisia.
I want him to do anything and everything.	Medi be wòawɔ nusianu kple nusianu.
However, it is not consistent.	Ke hã, mewɔa nu ɖekae o.
We can all do that.	Mí katã míate ŋu awɔ ema.
I never really knew that part of his life.	Nyemenya eƒe agbe ƒe akpa ma ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o.
I think it’s quite clear.	Mesusu be eme kɔ kura.
Get.	Xɔ.
And that means something.	Eye ema fia nane.
I’ve seen them before, but not today.	Mekpɔ wo kpɔ, gake menye egbea o.
But this is just right.	Gake esia sɔ ko.
Things had been going well for them.	Nuwo nɔ edzi yim nyuie na wo tsã.
Just what is necessary.	Nusi hiã ko.
That’s why this afternoon was so amazing.	Esia tae ŋdɔ sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ ɖo.
That’s what started it.	Emae dze egɔme.
That just seems weird.	Ðeko ema dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ene.
Thank you, everyone.	Akpe na mi, amesiame.
But talk to them.	Gake ƒo nu kpli wo.
Or let them do any work.	Alo na woawɔ dɔ ɖesiaɖe.
I don’t want any sides between them.	Nyemedi be akpa aɖeke nanɔ wo dome o.
. . . .	.
There are just too many people.	Ðeko amewo sɔ gbɔ akpa.
Tom looked away.	Tom ɖe ŋku ɖa.
It can’t upset you.	Mate ŋu ado dziku na wò o.
I sat down early.	Menɔ anyi kaba.
What a fine machine.	Mɔ̃ nyui kae nye si.
But he never did that.	Gake mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
There was still heavy loss of life.	Amewo ƒe agbe bu vevie gakpɔtɔ nɔ anyi.
I’m glad he never found it.	Edzɔ dzi nam be meke ɖe eŋu kpɔ o.
He was the only one in the room.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ xɔa me.
But again, this is hardly the right time.	Gake le afisia hã la, esia menye ɣeyiɣi si sɔ kura o.
Like everyone else.	Abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
Another problem may arise.	Kuxi bubu aɖe ate ŋu ado mo ɖa.
What they have in many places in many cases here.	Nusi le wo si le teƒe geɖe le nya geɖe me le afisia.
But very well, though.	Gake nyuie ŋutɔ.
Maybe we can go somewhere else.	Ðewohĩ míate ŋu ayi teƒe bubu aɖe.
There was nothing else like it.	Nu bubu aɖeke menɔ anyi si sɔ kple esia o.
Let me explain	Mina maɖe eme .
Please make this work.	Taflatse na esia nawɔ dɔ.
It can never happen.	Mate ŋu adzɔ gbeɖe o.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
There has to be a way.	Ele be mɔ aɖe nanɔ anyi.
This work is important for several reasons.	Dɔ sia le vevie le susu geɖe ta.
Everyone is not the same.	Amesiame mele ɖeka o.
You have to do the work.	Ele be nàwɔ dɔa.
That morning.	Ŋdi ma.
He wouldn’t let go.	Maɖe asi le eŋu o.
I just knew it was true in my heart.	Ðeko menya be enye nyateƒe le nye dzi me.
Do good in every way.	Wɔ nyui le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
This was unexpected.	Esia menɔ mɔ kpɔm na o.
It seems like.	Edze abe.
This is different.	Esia to vovo.
Without water there is no life	Tsi manɔmee la, agbe aɖeke meli o
He fled the scene.	Esi dzo.
That is not for any irrational reason.	Menye susu aɖeke si me susu mele o tae wòle nenema ɖo o.
So is my head.	Nenema ke nye ta hã le.
I'm trying to figure out how to do that.	Mele agbagba dzem be makpɔ alesi mawɔ emae.
Come looking for us.	Va nɔ mía dim.
I’m telling you the truth.	Megblɔ nyateƒe na mi.
I don’t think one is easier than another.	Nyemesusu be ɖeka mele bɔbɔe wu bubu o.
I work in one.	Mewɔa dɔ le ɖeka me.
Maybe it will help his own cause.	Ðewohĩ akpe ɖe eya ŋutɔ ƒe nya ŋu.
It may take a little while.	Ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe.
Keep your eyes open.	Lé ŋku ɖe nu ŋu.
They just didn’t have time for us.	Ðeko ɣeyiɣi menɔ wo si na mí o.
It was a challenge for me.	Enye kuxi aɖe nam.
Everyone looked surprised.	Amesiame dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku nɛ ene.
And that’s why you’re not ready.	Eye esia tae mèle klalo o.
This takes some time.	Esia xɔa ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
Many people have been thinking about this.	Ame geɖe ƒe susu va nɔ nya sia ŋu.
You can do this at least several times.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia zi geɖe ya teti.
Few people know the truth about it.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nya nyateƒe si ku ɖe eŋu.
This just occurred to me.	Ðeko esia va susu me nam.
It can still happen.	Ate ŋu adzɔ kokoko.
There are many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe li.
But this is different.	Gake esia to vovo.
That was a long time.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
But there is no food.	Gake nuɖuɖu aɖeke meli o.
Ours is included.	Mía tɔ hã le eme.

I hope to meet you there.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mado go wò le afima.
I have a serious problem with this guy.	Kuxi sesẽ aɖe le ŋunye le ŋutsu sia ŋu.
I joined a new job two months ago.	Meva ge ɖe dɔ yeye aɖe me ɣleti eve enye sia.
Everyone must obey the law.	Ele be ame sia ame nawɔ ɖe se la dzi.
And over several days.	Eye le ŋkeke geɖe me.
It had been a harsh winter.	Dzomeŋɔli sesẽ aɖee wònye tsã.

I am the morning person.	Nyee nye ŋdi me tɔ.
I want that, of course.	Medi nenema ya.
Now he too is dead.	Fifia eya hã ku.
I never knew about them.	Nyemenya nu tso wo ŋu kpɔ o.

The king is not strong.	Fia la meli ke o.
I work hard.	Mewɔa dɔ sesĩe.
Go, work, make money.	Yi, wɔ dɔ, kpɔ ga.
No teeth are necessary.	Aɖu aɖeke mehiã o.
That’s why it’s there.	Esia tae wòle afima ɖo.
But that’s only a small part.	Gake akpa sue aɖe koe ema nye.
I shouldn’t be doing this.	Mele be manɔ esia wɔm o.
You could say that they are.	Àte ŋu agblɔ be wole nenema.
We probably know each other.	Anɔ eme be míenya mía nɔewo.
He can’t help you.	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò o.
That’s in your blood.	Ema le wò ʋu me.
It’s just the way life is.	Ale si agbe le koe wònye.
We have to fight as hard as we can.	Ele be míawɔ avu alesi míate ŋui.
So, .	Eya ta, .
I can’t allow that.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ nenema o.
But I couldn’t do it.	Gake nyemete ŋui o.
Consider something else.	Bu nu bubu aɖe ŋu kpɔ.
I sincerely apologize.	Meɖe kuku tso dzi me.
But there were some problems.	Gake kuxi aɖewo nɔ anyi.
Not that much more expensive.	Menye nusi xɔ asi wu nenema gbegbe o.
My point is correct.	Nye nya la sɔ.
But there is plenty of food.	Gake nuɖuɖu sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
But he also has other good qualities.	Gake nɔnɔme nyui bubu aɖewo hã le esi.
Think of it as the first night.	Bu eŋu be enye zã gbãtɔ.
Doing something.	Nane wɔwɔ.
He did such a good job.	Ewɔ dɔ nyui ma gbegbe.
And if something goes wrong.	Eye ne nane gblẽ la.
Write that down.	Ŋlɔ nu ma ɖi.
But it’s not showing anything.	Gake menye naneke ɖem wòle o.
None of these things have hit me yet.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke medze dzinye haɖe o.
Same as any man.	Nenema ke abe ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe ene.
Over there, somewhere.	Le afima, le afi aɖe.
There is just no way that could ever happen.	Ðeko mɔ aɖeke meli si dzi ema ate ŋu adzɔ gbeɖe o.
How did he know my name.	Aleke wòwɔ nya nye ŋkɔ.
Add a few pinches of salt.	Tsɔ dze ʋɛ aɖewo de eme.
It is true in a way.	Enye nyateƒe le mɔ aɖe nu.
There was always something behind it.	Nane nɔ megbe nɛ ɣesiaɣi.
It just doesn’t exist at this point.	Ðeko meli le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
I was very, very pleased.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
But he would have none of it.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖeke manɔ esi o.
It just isn’t.	Ðeko mele nenema o.
Thanks for taking the time to talk to me today.	Akpe na wò be nèdi ɣeyiɣi ƒo nu nam egbea.
So was everyone else.	Nenema ke ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã nɔ.
Maybe doing something positive will help.	Ðewohĩ nu nyui aɖe wɔwɔ akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
Prices have gone up dramatically.	Nuwo ƒe asi yi dzi ŋutɔ.
That goes beyond that.	Ema yi ŋgɔ wu ema.
I thought that was just me.	Mesusu be nye koe nye ema.
The state of mind.	Susu ƒe nɔnɔme.
Work, and work hard.	Wɔ dɔ, eye nàwɔ dɔ sesĩe.
I think this is kind of that.	Mesusu be esia nye ema ƒomevi aɖe.
Very simple, actually.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
I've been there, but this is beyond really cool.	Menɔ afima kpɔ, gake esia de ŋgɔ wu nusi me kɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
On horse back again.	Le sɔ dzi trɔ gbɔ ake.
He had never felt so much in his life.	Mese le eɖokui me nenema gbegbe le eƒe agbe me kpɔ o.
They are so few and far between though.	Wole ʋɛ ale gbegbe eye wo dome didi ŋutɔ gake.
I can go on and on.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi.
That’s pretty clear.	Ema me kɔ nyuie.
I am still in charge.	Megale dɔa dzi kpɔm kokoko.
That was too small, too.	Ema hã nɔ sue akpa.
Take your time, but be quick.	Di wò ɣeyiɣi, gake wɔ nu kaba.
This is good for them.	Esia nyo na wo.
I am doing housework.	Mele aƒeme dɔ wɔm.
Something will happen now.	Nane adzɔ fifia.
It would be just as easy, or maybe easier.	Anɔ bɔbɔe nenema ke, alo ɖewohĩ anɔ bɔbɔe wu.
Some last for a while, but a few last longer.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nɔa anyi ɣeyiɣi aɖe, gake ʋɛ aɖewo ya nɔa anyi didi wu.
But more is really needed.	Gake nusi wu emae hiã ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I wanted that to work so badly.	Medi be ema nawɔ dɔ gbegblẽ ale gbegbe.
I really tried.	Medze agbagba ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The room is interesting.	Xɔa me doa dzidzɔ na ame.
They are right where you are.	Wole afisi tututu nèle.
But the matter is open.	Ke nya la ɖe enu.
That’s because of the truth.	Ema nye nyateƒe ta.
Not really sure yet.	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔŋutɔ vaseɖe fifia o.

I was worried about it.	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu.

This was not easy for any of us.	Esia menɔ bɔbɔe na mía dometɔ aɖeke o.
We can only move forward.	Ðeko míate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ.
Maybe that will help you.	Ðewohĩ ema akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
Please, please help us.	Taflatse, taflatse kpe ɖe mía ŋu.
He lost his character.	Eƒe nɔnɔme bu.
He really likes the dog.	Avu la dzɔa dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
It was the voice of a child.	Enye ɖevi ƒe gbe.
A house is a house.	Aƒe nye aƒe.
He is not acting normally today.	Menye ɖe wòle nu wɔm le mɔ si sɔ nu egbea o.
I didn’t look down.	Nyemekpɔ ŋku ɖe anyi o.
I know it can’t be easy.	Menya be mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe o.
This seemed like a good opportunity.	Esia dze abe mɔnukpɔkpɔ nyui aɖee wònye ene.
The car fell off.	Ʋua dze anyi.
I was incensed by his comment.	Eƒe nya sia do dziku nam.

Maybe its all week.	Ðewohĩ eƒe kwasiɖa bliboa katã.
Do everything right.	Wɔ nusianu nyuie.
That’s just part of it.	Eƒe akpa aɖe koe nye ema.
That would be awesome.	Ema anye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He didn’t expect that.	Mekpɔ mɔ nenema o.
He couldn’t connect with her.	Mete ŋu do ka kplii o.
I'm the one who is.	Nyee nye esia.
This is very exciting.	Esia doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
Some of that is valid.	Ema dometɔ aɖewo sɔ.
There was no room for it.	Teƒe aɖeke menɔ anyi na esia o.
Everything about you.	Nusianu si ku ɖe ŋuwò.
There are no rules.	Se aɖeke meli o.
A reasonable mindset.	Susu si me susu le.
Listen to it now.	Lé to ɖe eŋu fifia.
You can talk to him.	Àte ŋu aƒo nu kplii.
Anything and everything is still possible.	Nusianu kple nusianu gakpɔtɔ ate ŋu adzɔ.
It was a wonderful day.	Enye ŋkeke nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I did a lot of work here for him.	Mewɔ dɔ geɖe le afisia nɛ.
Money speaks.	Ga ƒoa nu.
Very, very important.	Vevie ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
There are many things involved.	Nu geɖe le eme.
In the long run.	Le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe megbe la.
I never understood that I didn’t need it.	Mese egɔme kpɔ be mehiã nam o.
And he stayed	Eye wònɔ anyi .
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Nothing much going on.	Naneke mele edzi yim boo o.
In the end, it all came to a head.	Mlɔeba la, wo katã va ɖo ta me.
He couldn’t stand it.	Mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
I’ve done it before.	Mewɔe kpɔ.
Ask someone to do something.	Bia ame aɖe be wòawɔ nane.
The police came.	Kpovitɔwo va.
It worked out very well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
There is something about it, too.	Nane le eŋu hã.
I got sick.	Medze dɔ.
And now he had a gun in his face.	Eye fifia tu nɔ eƒe mo.
Once we moved in there.	Esi míenya ʋu yi afima ko.
In fact, he has a child.	Le nyateƒe me la, vi aɖe le esi.
It was my first day at work.	Enye nye ŋkeke gbãtɔ le dɔme.
I never understood that.	Nyemese nya ma gɔme kpɔ o.
That’s what’s so interesting.	Emae nye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
You can do this in your own way.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia le wò ŋutɔ wò mɔ nu.
In thousands of ways.	Mɔ akpe geɖe dzi.
He will find no help there.	Makpɔ kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke le afima o.
The truth doesn’t matter at all.	Nyateƒea mele vevie kura o.
He invested time and money in this project.	Etsɔ ɣeyiɣi kple ga de dɔ sia me.
I was the one he had.	Nyee nɔ esi.
Not another week.	Menye kwasiɖa bubu o.
He can’t control himself.	Mate ŋu aɖu eɖokui dzi o.
I tried a few times.	Mete kpɔ zi ʋɛ aɖewo.
It was another mistake on my part.	Enye vodada bubu si mewɔ le nye akpa dzi.
There is some truth in that.	Nyateƒe aɖe le nya ma me.
I said that.	Megblɔ be.
I had to represent them.	Ele be manɔ wo teƒe.
I'm not really sure what he's waiting for.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi tututu wòle lalam dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
That’s different.	Ema to vovo.
To some extent, that problem still exists today.	Vaseɖe afi aɖe la, kuxi ma gakpɔtɔ li egbea.
Attitude is equally important.	Nɔnɔme le vevie nenema ke.
He can be a very strong man.	Ate ŋu anye ŋutsu sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
He wasn’t so sure of himself.	Meka ɖe eɖokui dzi nenema gbegbe o.
The wind blew hard all day.	Ya ƒo sesĩe ŋkeke bliboa.
It has never been useful.	Meɖe vi aɖeke kpɔ o.
Everyone else moved on.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ʋu yi ŋgɔ.
The hole seems a little small.	Edze abe doa le sue vie ene.
But still, they’re there.	Gake kokoko la, wole afima.
Hard water, maybe.	Tsi sesẽ, ɖewohĩ.
Fire destroyed his house.	Dzo gblẽ eƒe aƒe dome.

There’s something in me.	Nane le menye.
Today, however, it is not easy.	Gake egbea la, mele bɔbɔe o.

You don’t have to work anymore.	Mehiã be nàwɔ dɔ azɔ o.
He will not be in the house.	Manɔ aƒea me o.
I remember that day vividly.	Meɖo ŋku ŋkeke ma dzi nyuie.
Sure.	Ka ɖe edzi.
The teacher introduced himself.	Nufiala la ɖe eɖokui fia.
It’s an incredible statement.	Enye nya si mexɔ se o.
But it is not at all.	Gake mele nenema kura o.
I can be a teacher.	Mate ŋu anye nufiala.
It was a good time for me.	Enye ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe nam.
A few months later, things changed.	Le ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo megbe la, nuwo trɔ.
I look forward to working with you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be mawɔ dɔ kpli mi.
The police came.	Kpovitɔwo va.
It was this or nothing.	Enye esia alo naneke o.
I still haven’t been able to call.	Nyemete ŋu ƒo ka o vaseɖe fifia.
It was really, really, really good.	Enye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ, nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It will come true.	Ava eme.
Or a stone.	Alo kpe aɖe.
The project is ready and running.	Dɔa le klalo eye wòle dɔ wɔm.
He was a good guy.	Ame nyui aɖee wònye.
Too much to do.	Nu geɖe akpa be woawɔ.
Decide if there are only two possibilities.	Tso nya me nenye be nu eve koe ate ŋu adzɔ.
More money than that.	Ga geɖe wu.
But one thing remains.	Gake nu ɖeka ya gakpɔtɔ li.
There were two separate problems.	Kuxi eve siwo to vovo nɔ anyi.
There will be a better time.	Anye ɣeyiɣi si nyo wu la anɔ anyi.
It doesn’t work.	Mewɔa dɔ o.
No one could really help me with it.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu kpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔŋutɔ le eŋu o.
And this can be beneficial, obviously.	Eye esia ate ŋu aɖe vi na mí, edze ƒã.
There is nothing like that.	Naneke meli nenema o.
Maybe not so long ago.	Ðewohĩ menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia o.
You never had to work with him otherwise.	Mehiã gbeɖe be nàwɔ dɔ kplii ne menye nenema o.
I got hot.	Mexɔ dzo.
He can help out here.	Ate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu le afisia.
We know each other well.	Míenya mía nɔewo nyuie.
Go on and on and on.	Yi edzi kple edzi.
I know where everyone is.	Menya afisi amesiame le.
And he had an idea or two of his own.	Eye eya ŋutɔ ƒe susu ɖeka alo eve nɔ esi.
Go up in the afternoon.	Yi dzi le ŋdɔ me.
I would have done more.	Anye ne mawɔ geɖe wu.
It didn’t offend him.	Medo dziku nɛ o.
Everything you say is true.	Nya sia nya si nàgblɔ la nye nyateƒe.
But he wasn’t quite in a hurry.	Gake mewɔ kaba tututu o.
It’s totally normal.	Enye nusi sɔ kura.
He just sat there.	Ðeko wònɔ anyi ɖe afima.
I was just there.	Ðeko menɔ afima.
This job kept me busy.	Dɔ sia na vovo menɔ ŋunye o.
He wasn't sure what to do.	Meka ɖe nusi wòawɔ dzi o.
And they have plenty of room to work with.	Eye teƒe geɖe le wo si woawɔ dɔ kplii.
We have a job to do.	Dɔ le mía si míawɔ.
But it is going backwards.	Gake ele megbe yim.
And he never did that.	Eye mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
It seems clear to us that it is.	Edze abe eme kɔ na mí be ele nenema ene.
Again, no issue.	Le afisia hã la, nya aɖeke meli o.
And you’re making me angry.	Eye èle dziku dom nam.
That will work now.	Ema awɔ dɔ fifia.
But something seemed to be wrong.	Gake edze abe nane gblẽ le eŋu ene.
We don’t know what they want.	Míenya nusi dim wole o.
A man shot him in the face.	Ŋutsu aɖe da tu eƒe mo.
No one does this.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa esia o.
Get into that process.	Ge ɖe ɖoɖo ma me.
And it is a treat.	Eye enye nuɖuɖu na ame.
It’s amazing to see you up and up.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ be makpɔ wò le dzi kple dzi.
It was like something was stuck in my throat.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe nane tsi nye kɔ me ene.
That certainly makes sense.	Susu le nya ma me godoo.
I had never heard of that.	Nyemese nya ma kpɔ o.
There was so much going on.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ edzi yim.
But not in this case.	Gake menye le go sia me o.
So, they deserve whatever they are asking for.	Eya ta, nu sia nu si biam wole la dze na wo.
You liked this part.	Akpa sia dze ŋuwò.
In people’s heads.	Amewo ƒe ta me.
There is nothing he can do.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ o.
There was nothing any of us could have done.	Naneke meli mía dometɔ aɖeke ate ŋu awɔ hafi o.
His mouth was very wet.	Eƒe nu ƒo tsi ŋutɔ.
They only have each other.	Wo nɔewo koe le wo si.
I have been.	Menɔ.
There is a great seed there.	Nuku gã aɖe le afima.
I’ve seen his stuff.	Mekpɔ eƒe nuwo kpɔ.
That annoys me.	Ema doa dziku nam.
We have to work the same way.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ nenema ke.
I was focused on it.	Nye susu nɔ eŋu.
But there are still two.	Gake eve gakpɔtɔ li.
I did something wrong.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
Only a part of it.	Akpa aɖe koe.
No one had a name.	Ŋkɔ aɖeke menɔ ame aɖeke si o.
He is protecting you.	Ele ta kpɔm na wò.
I wasn’t happy.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
It’s important.	Ele vevie.
And no one does anything about it.	Eye ame aɖeke mewɔa naneke tso eŋu o.
In the long run.	Le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe me.
A man approached him.	Ŋutsu aɖe te ɖe eŋu.
In this case, everyone got what they wanted.	Le go sia me la, amesiame kpɔ nusi dim wòle.
He tried to stay focused.	Edze agbagba be yeƒe susu nanɔ nu ŋu.
Really? 	Nyateƒea?
I couldn’t stand it.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
He couldn’t leave.	Mete ŋu dzo o.
That would be a big deal.	Ema anye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But last night changed everything.	Gake zã si va yi la trɔ nusianu.
I know people have done that.	Menya be amewo wɔe nenema.
You can tell me anything.	Àte ŋu agblɔ nya sia nya nam.
They’ve been at this for a very long time.	Wole esia me ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
In fact, the opposite happened.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ.
I don’t want anything .	Nyemedi naneke o .
You have a problem now!	Kuxi aɖe le ŋuwò fifia!
I’m not sure anyone else really can.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be ame bubu aɖeke ate ŋui ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
But it’s just himself.	Gake eya ŋutɔ koe.
I tried, you know.	Medze agbagba, ènya.
There is no issue of any kind.	Nya aɖeke ƒomevi aɖeke meli o.
But again, there are many problems.	Gake le afisia hã la, kuxi geɖe li.
I think it is the case.	Mesusu be ele nenema.
I didn’t feel bad, somehow.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be nyemele nyuie o, le mɔ aɖe nu.
I don’t really understand this.	Nyemese nya sia gɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Or maybe not for you.	Alo ɖewohĩ menye na wò o.
I didn’t see anyone there.	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke le afima o.
Few things are needed.	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe hiã.
I have been wanting since past few days.	Medi vevie tso ŋkeke ʋɛ siwo va yi me.
Stop your current situation.	Wò nɔnɔme si me nèle fifia la tɔ.
None of us can do it.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋui o.
Only people who really care about me.	Ame siwo tsɔ ɖe le eme nam ŋutɔŋutɔ koe.
Many of us were going to die.	Mía dometɔ geɖe nɔ ku ge.
If he deserves it, go with him.	Ne edze la, ke yi kplii.
Maybe it was all he did.	Ðewohĩ eya koe nye nusi wòwɔ.
Not for me.	Menye nam o.
Pay for them in cash.	Fe ɖe wo ta le ga me.
Or how to get out of it.	Alo alesi woawɔ ado le eme.
I was very happy with myself.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu.
I had a lot of other things to do.	Nu bubu geɖe nɔ asinye mawɔ.
I would like it to be awesome.	Madi be wòawɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Check out what’s going on.	Kpɔ nusi le edzi yim ɖa.
Everyone has been here.	Amesiame nɔ afisia kpɔ.
There was some truth there.	Nyateƒe aɖe nɔ afima.
We cannot answer that question.	Míate ŋu aɖo nya ma ŋu o.
Neither is very easy.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ o.
I could understand it very well.	Mete ŋu se egɔme nyuie ŋutɔ.
There is no word yet.	Nya aɖeke meli haɖe o.
He put his hand in the pool.	Etsɔ eƒe asi de ta la me.
Be the first to send one!.	Nye ame gbãtɔ si aɖo ɖeka ɖa!.
They are just going backwards.	Ðeko wole megbe yim.
He could never get inside.	Mete ŋu ge ɖe eme gbeɖe o.
This time it was a dead dog.	Fifia ya, avu kuku aɖee.
It is very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ.
This is a real thing.	Esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
His mind couldn’t process it.	Eƒe susu mete ŋu wɔ dɔ tso eŋu o.
It’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I'll have to work that out with you.	Ele be mawɔ dɔ tso nya ma ŋu kpli wò.
He might be better off without her.	Ðewohĩ eya manɔmee la, anyo nɛ wu.
But few people gave.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe na nu.
I felt the same way.	Nye hã mese le ɖokuinye me nenema ke.
But it was my first systematic program.	Gake enye nye ɖoɖo gbãtɔ si mewɔ ɖe ɖoɖo nu.
Like right now, actually come to think of it.	Abe fifia ene la, le nyateƒe me la, va bu eŋu.
I can get it.	Mete ŋu xɔa.
I am smaller than this.	Nyee le sue wu esia.
Still, not much more than a few nice clothes.	Ke hã, menye nu geɖe wu awu nyui ʋɛ aɖewo ko o.

I can’t do this.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia o.
I can’t seem to place the time and place.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu aɖo ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe si wòle o ene.
There wasn’t much in it.	Nu geɖe menɔ eme o.
They are looking for opportunity.	Wole mɔnukpɔkpɔ dim.
From there, everything changed.	Tso afima la, nusianu trɔ.
Usually there is only one person.	Zi geɖe la, ame ɖeka koe nɔa anyi.
So I work every day.	Eya ta mewɔa dɔ gbe sia gbe.
That house must be very old.	Aƒe ma anya do xoxo ŋutɔ.
See what we can do.	Kpɔ nu si míate ŋu awɔ ɖa.
Only one thing is missing.	Nu ɖeka koe bu.
But it is in bad shape.	Gake ele nɔnɔme gbegblẽ me.
That part just went over my head.	Ðeko akpa ma to nye ta dzi.
I want to say something.	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖe.
And he couldn’t do anything for her.	Eye mete ŋu wɔ naneke nɛ o.
Maybe, maybe we can.	Ðewohĩ, ɖewohĩ míate ŋui.
This is a fact.	Esia nye nyateƒe.
He has no time either.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke mele esi hã o.
The voice above everything else.	Gbe si le nu bubu ɖesiaɖe dzi.
No one ever asked them.	Ame aɖeke mebia wo kpɔ o.
OH! 	O!
He worked himself to death.	Ewɔ dɔ le eɖokui ŋu vaseɖe ku me.
Say something if you have one.	Gblɔ nya aɖe ne ɖe le asiwò.
Ask what else we can help you do.	Bia nu bubu kae míate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò nàwɔ hã.
In fact, he could probably play anything.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ ate ŋu aƒo nusianu.
But this room will not work.	Gake xɔ sia mawɔ dɔ o.
I don’t know what to do.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
I'm having a little problem.	Kuxi vi aɖe le fu ɖem nam.
I am not one of these people.	Menye ame siawo dometɔ ɖekae menye o.
That will work.	Ema awɔ dɔ.
Everything about this new king came out loud.	Fia yeye sia ƒe nusianu do nu sesĩe.
It’s probably a bad thing.	Anɔ eme be enye nu gbegblẽ.
Now it doesn’t.	Fifia mewɔe nenema o.
A little help would be nice.	Kpekpeɖeŋu vi aɖe anyo ŋutɔ.
And look at this place.	Eye kpɔ teƒe sia ɖa.
But not like before.	Gake menye abe tsã ene o.
They’re trying, but it’s not working.	Wole agbagba dzem, gake mele dɔ wɔm o.
One dog was struck by a rock.	Kpe aɖe ƒo avu ɖeka.
Everything went well, everything went very well.	Nusianu yi nyuie, nusianu yi nyuie ŋutɔ.
Like, the same kind of idea.	Abe, susu ma ke ƒomevi ene.
People are fighting over it.	Amewo le avu wɔm le eŋu.
Everything will be fine.	Nusianu anyo.
I said something.	Megblɔ nya aɖe.
I should have known earlier.	Ðe wòle be manya do ŋgɔ hafi.
You’re trying to protect them.	Èle agbagba dzem be yeakpɔ wo ta.
There are no rules in this thing.	Se aɖeke mele nu sia me o.
You know there is a very good reason for this.	Ènya be susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ li si tae wòle alea ɖo.
You have to work too.	Ele be wò hã nàwɔ dɔ.
He couldn’t sit here all day.	Mete ŋu nɔ anyi ɖe afisia ŋkeke bliboa o.
A new day is coming.	Ŋkeke yeye aɖe gbɔna.
I can’t do it alone though.	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔe o gake.
You can see as much as you want.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe alesi nèdi.
I don’t want to do that.	Nyemedi be mawɔ nu ma o.
I am trying to find a new job.	Mele agbagba dzem be makpɔ dɔ yeye aɖe.
It is totally illegal.	Enye nusi ŋu se meɖe mɔ ɖo kura o.
Maybe we could stay there.	Ðewohĩ míate ŋu anɔ afima.
But this is true only to a certain extent.	Gake esia nye nyateƒe vaseɖe afi aɖe ko.
Guide each section.	Fia mɔ akpa ɖesiaɖe.
He will remember that.	Aɖo ŋku nya ma dzi.
It is impossible to do that.	Manya wɔ be woawɔ nenema o.
He has no children.	Vi aɖeke mele esi o.
There has to be a lot in it.	Ele be nu geɖe nanɔ eme.
It is not so easy to	Mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe be .
Consider what happened.	Kpɔ nusi dzɔ ɖa.
But we seem to be going through it all.	Gake edze abe míele wo katã me tom ene.
I gave him a piece.	Metsɔ akpa aɖe nɛ.
Last year fell years behind.	Ƒe si va yi la ge ɖe megbe ƒe geɖe.
She still doesn’t understand who he is.	Mese amesi wònye gɔme haɖe o.
There is so much to do.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li woawɔ.
For my part here.	Le nye akpa si mewɔ le afisia ta.
What he had, of course.	Nusi nɔ esi ya.
But it can get very hot in the summer.	Gake ate ŋu axɔ dzo ŋutɔ le dzomeŋɔli.
This could be very good for him.	Esia ate ŋu anyo nɛ ŋutɔ.
Enter your name here.	Ŋlɔ wò ŋkɔ ɖe afisia.
Now go to work.	Azɔ yi dɔme.
But please do just this one thing for me.	Gake taflatse wɔ nu ɖeka sia ko nam.
There was a lot of water.	Tsi geɖe nɔ afima.
Maybe he never came.	Ðewohĩ meva kpɔ o.
But it won’t be that easy.	Gake manɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
Perhaps you liked him very much.	Ðewohĩ eƒe nu lé dzi na wò ŋutɔ.
The change in his face was amazing.	Ale si eƒe mo trɔ la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
They might have a point, and you can work around that.	Ðewohĩ nya aɖe anɔ wo si, eye àte ŋu awɔ dɔ tso esia ŋu.
None of us did that.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
I do something instead.	Mewɔa nane ɖe eteƒe.
I want to live that reality.	Medi be manɔ agbe ɖe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ma nu.
It’s good and bad.	Enye nu nyui kple nu gbegblẽ.
The price is reasonable but not expensive.	Ga la sɔ nyuie gake mexɔ asi o.
Everything was fighting for itself.	Nusianu nɔ avu wɔm ɖe eɖokui ta.
One should not be too hasty about this.	Mele be ame nawɔ kaba akpa le esia ŋu o.
I must have done something right.	Anɔ eme be mewɔ nane nyuie.
This is not easy to achieve.	Esia gbɔ ɖoɖo mele bɔbɔe o.
You are not asking for anything.	Menye naneke biam nèle o.
That’s his job.	Emae nye eƒe dɔ.
But many will need more than that.	Gake ame geɖe ahiã nu geɖe wu ema.
Each of us will do that.	Mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe awɔe nenema.
As such, these aspects are mutually exclusive.	Esi wòle alea ta la, akpa siawo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
I will stay for about a week.	Manɔ anyi abe kwasiɖa ɖeka ene.
He was just wondering what it was like.	Ðeko wònɔ eɖokui biam be aleke wòle hã.
I want to go.	Medi be mayi.
The issue is very difficult.	Nya la sesẽ ŋutɔ.
The hand touched another.	Asi la va ka asi bubu ŋu.
So are you, too.	Wò hã nèle nenema.
Now what will they do?.	Azɔ nukae woawɔ?.
He did everything he could.	Ewɔ nusianu si wòate ŋui.
I was trying to.	Menɔ agbagba dzem.
It felt like the right thing for him.	Ewɔ nam abe nu si sɔ nɛ ene.
He couldn’t speak at all.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu kura o.
My head is right.	Nye ta le eteƒe.
These people were talking there.	Ame siawo nɔ nu ƒom le afi ma.
It’s everything now.	Enye nusianu fifia.
But it seemed like a year to him.	Gake edze nɛ abe ƒe aɖe ene.
That’s the whole point.	Emae nye nya bliboa.
It can have many names.	Ŋkɔ geɖe ate ŋu anɔ eŋu.
There was never any waste.	Gbegblẽ aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
Each exposed and nothing in between.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ɖe eɖokui ɖe go eye naneke mele wo dome o.
It didn’t make sense to me.	Susu menɔ eme nam o.
I was angry with myself.	Medo dziku ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu.
I have a lot of things.	Nu geɖe le asinye.
Just a possibility.	Nusi ate ŋu adzɔ koe.
I think he surprised himself.	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku na eɖokui.
None of these things are true.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
That is also very difficult.	Ema hã sesẽ ŋutɔ.
And that’s no small thing.	Eye ema menye nu sue aɖeke o.
He never sat still.	Menɔ anyi ɖe teƒe ɖeka gbeɖe o.
He didn’t understand.	Mese egɔme o.
Look for us there.	Di mí le afima.
Keep touching it.	Yi edzi ka asi eŋu.
Many people have died now.	Ame geɖe ku fifia.
It can’t be true.	Mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
By just a fraction of it.	To eƒe akpa sue aɖe ko dzi.
He is currently working on his own book.	Ele dɔ wɔm tso eya ŋutɔ ƒe agbalẽ ŋu fifia.
The dog didn’t come.	Avu la meva o.
And we have work to do.	Eye dɔ le mía si míawɔ.
No one cares about it.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
If only I could look back on that day.	Ne ɖe mate ŋu akpɔ ŋkeke ma le megbe la.
We have two teeth in our lives.	Aɖu eve le mía si le míaƒe agbe me.
If possible.	Ne anya wɔ la.
I can make this work for you.	Mate ŋu ana esia nawɔ dɔ na wò.
That requires a lot of work.	Ema bia dɔ geɖe wɔwɔ.
No one can take it away from you.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu aɖee le ŋuwò o.
There is no word in mind.	Nya aɖeke mele susu me o.
Now heal that face.	Azɔ da gbe le mo ma ŋu.
I can’t win this.	Nyemate ŋu aɖu dzi le esia me o.
Very few in fact.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe le nyateƒe me.
He still didn’t trust me.	Meka ɖe dzinye kokoko o.
That's why.	Ema tae.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
You have someone else on your side.	Ame bubu aɖe le asiwò le wò akpa dzi.
That last thing is very important.	Nu mamlɛtɔ ma le vevie ŋutɔ.
And you probably know his name.	Eye ɖewohĩ ènya eƒe ŋkɔ.
You can do this in two ways.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia le mɔ eve nu.
The whole room was very dirty.	Xɔa me katã ƒo ɖi ŋutɔ.
I’m the only one he can talk about this with.	Nye ɖeka koe wòate ŋu aƒo nu tso nya sia ŋu na.
To my surprise, he had a gun.	Ewɔ nuku nam be tu ɖe asi.
Long before you.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe do ŋgɔ na wò.
My house is near the lake.	Nye aƒe te ɖe ta la ŋu.
It is in your creation.	Ele wò wɔwɔ me.
We don’t know what your real problem is.	Míenya nusi nye wò kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I was interested in seeing more.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme be makpɔ nu geɖe wu.
This is a great moment.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe.
It should not be too small.	Mele be eƒe nɔnɔme nanɔ sue akpa o.
Everyone is having fun.	Amesiame le dzidzɔ kpɔm.
His face is troubled.	Eƒe mo le fu ɖem nɛ.
He frowned, but said nothing.	Ewɔ mo nɛ, gake megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I need at least two.	Mehiã eve ya teti.
We don’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele mía si o.
And maybe they are.	Eye ɖewohĩ wole nenema.
Let me stay in your house.	Na manɔ wò aƒe me.
However there is no problem with that.	Ke hã kuxi aɖeke mele ema ŋu o.
Also, my own heart.	Azɔ hã, nye ŋutɔ nye dzi.
But the truth is hard.	Gake nyateƒea sesẽ.
There may be a way.	Mɔ aɖe ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
None of it is new.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nu yeye o.
I'll let you do that.	Maɖe mɔ na wò nenema.

Help! 	Kpekpeɖeŋu!

someone helped us!	ame aɖe kpe ɖe mía ŋu!
There is some truth in that.	Nyateƒe aɖe le ema me.
There is always something.	Nane nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi.
There were many original chapters.	Ta gbãtɔ geɖe nɔ eme.
I will continue to save people.	Mayi edzi axɔ na amewo.
I asked for help.	Mebia kpekpeɖeŋu.
This diet really worked for me.	Nuɖuɖu sia wɔ dɔ nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I know what this means.	Menya nusi esia fia.
Why is it so slow? 	Nukatae wòle nenema?
I'm not sure what changed.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi trɔ dzi o.
It’s nothing out of the ordinary and strange.	Menye nane si to vovo eye wòwɔ nuku o.
Today, that might be double.	Egbea la, ɖewohĩ ema anye zi gbɔ zi eve.
In this case, there are two clear paths.	Le go sia me la, mɔ eve siwo me kɔ la li.
I knew it was real.	Menya be enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Right now, it’s very important.	Fifia la, ele vevie ŋutɔ.
I personally can hardly imagine this.	Nye ŋutɔ mate ŋu akpɔ esia le susu me kura o.
This is too strange.	Esia wɔ nuku akpa.
But there is only so much we can do.	Gake nu geɖe koe li míate ŋu awɔ.
You can’t go on like this.	Màte ŋu ayi edzi alea o.

Or that we are all the same.	Alo be mí katã míenye nu ɖeka.
It’s just not me.	Ðeko menye nyee o.
He can be with you in that moment.	Ate ŋu anɔ anyi kpli wò le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
This can happen at any time.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ ɣesiaɣi.
Put everything on one of them.	Tsɔ nusianu de wo dometɔ ɖeka dzi.
Like, what’s your attitude towards them.	Abe, nukae nye wò nɔnɔme ɖe wo ŋu ene.
His anger subsided.	Eƒe dziku nu yi.
But the wrongdoing is obvious.	Gake nu gbegblẽ si wòwɔ la dze ƒã.
Think about everything you have.	Bu nusianu si le asiwò ŋu kpɔ.
When did this happen?	Ɣekaɣie esia dzɔ?
The job wasn’t easy.	Dɔa menɔ bɔbɔe o.
I told him he didn’t have to do anything.	Megblɔ nɛ be mehiã be wòawɔ naneke o.
He didn’t try anything on it.	Mete naneke kpɔ le edzi o.
Like in two days.	Abe le ŋkeke eve me ene.
Maybe you can help us with this project.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu akpe ɖe mía ŋu le dɔ sia wɔwɔ me.
The king drew his sword.	Fia la ɖe eƒe yi.
Who still sees the snake?	Amekae gakpɔtɔ le da la kpɔm?
I just have to keep going.	Ðeko wòle be mayi edzi.
No problem, of course.	Kuxi aɖeke mele eme o ya.
We all know this has changed.	Mí katã míenya be esia trɔ.
That wouldn’t work at all.	Ema mawɔ dɔ kura o.
It will continue to continue.	Ayi edzi ayi edzi.
The way things are.	Ale si nuwo le.
Let me tell you, this stuff works.	Mina magblɔ na mi be, nu sia wɔa dɔ.
He didn’t know what else to do.	Menya nu bubu si wòawɔ o.
There is more space now than there has ever been.	Teƒe geɖe li fifia wu alesi wònɔ tsã.
None of us can go home now.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu ayi aƒe fifia o.
The matter occurred here.	Nya la dzɔ le afisia.
Hold on to them.	Lé wo me ɖe asi.
From my ‘better’ days.	Tso nye ŋkeke ‘siwo nyo wu’ dzi.
Something was obviously going on.	Edze ƒã be nane nɔ edzi yim.
And no one can tell you where it is.	Eye ame aɖeke mate ŋu agblɔ afi si wòle na wò o.
No one can tell you when either.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu agblɔ ɣekaɣie na wò hã o.
From the highway.	Tso mɔ gã la dzi.
Life was like that.	Agbe nɔ nenema.
I wasn’t really happy.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Can’t live without it.	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe ema manɔmee o.
There has to be a mistake.	Ele be vodada aɖe nanɔ anyi.
In a way, that was different.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, ema to vovo.
Come join our tribe!.	Va wɔ ɖeka kple míaƒe to la!.
There were no other problems.	Kuxi bubu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
But there was a big problem.	Gake kuxi gã aɖe nɔ anyi.
It is important to have a positive attitude.	Ele vevie be nɔnɔme nyui nanɔ asiwò.
We have to create a great attitude.	Ele be míawɔ nɔnɔme gã aɖe.
All of these things have come out of it.	Nu siawo katã do tso eme.
The reasoning is valid.	Susu si le eme la sɔ.
He will give you any help.	Ana kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe wò.
Reality, part one.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ, akpa gbãtɔ.
But that dog.	Gake avu ma.
And you are the only one	Eye wò koe nye .
There is nothing like this.	Naneke mele abe esia ene o.
Approach him at home.	Te ɖe eŋu le aƒeme.
A degenerate man doesn’t do that.	Ŋutsu si ƒe lãme gblẽ la mewɔa nu ma o.
This is going to work.	Esia le dɔ wɔ ge.
Clearly, something is wrong.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ.
But, the opposite is also true.	Gake, nusi to vovo na ema hã nye nyateƒe.
I have never tried it.	Nyemete kpɔ kpɔ o.
He didn’t know what he did.	Menya nusi wòwɔ o.
The building in the background is a school.	Xɔ si le megbe la nye suku aɖe.
Drive the car to him.	Ku ʋua ɖe eŋu.
That person who is there.	Ame ma si le afima.
And everyone believed in him.	Eye ame sia ame xɔ edzi se.
There was no one else.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
But money remains a problem.	Gake ga gakpɔtɔ nye kuxi.
This book was actually written by a man.	Le nyateƒe me la, ŋutsu aɖee ŋlɔ agbalẽ sia.
Air, food, water.	Ya, nuɖuɖu, tsi.
He just didn't know what to do with it all.	Ðeko menya nusi wòawɔ kple wo katã o.
I found a plan that would work.	Mekpɔ ɖoɖo aɖe si awɔ dɔ.
I’m the only one here.	Nye koe le afisia.
It didn’t upset him that much.	Medo dziku nɛ nenema o.
It will be fine now.	Anɔ nyuie fifia.
However, he never really did.	Ke hã, mewɔe nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
The room seemed suddenly warm.	Edze abe xɔa me xɔ dzo zi ɖeka ene.
There was no car now.	Ʋu aɖeke menɔ anyi fifia o.
I was ready to share my life with someone else.	Menɔ klalo be magblɔ nye agbe na ame bubu.
This thought bothered him.	Susu sia te ɖe edzi.
I'm pretty sure everyone knows.	Meka ɖe edzi tututu be amesiame nya.
And everything isn’t new either.	Eye nusianu hã menye nu yeye o.
The most surprising thing.	Nusi wɔ nuku wu.
I am just a man.	Ŋutsu koe menye.
A thousand words is almost enough.	Nya akpe ɖeka sɔ gbɔ kloe.
There was no teacher there.	Nufiala aɖeke menɔ afima o.
Which is good for me.	Nusi nyo nam.
There is no room for it here.	Teƒe aɖeke meli nɛ le afisia o.
Not that it matters now.	Menye ɖe wòle vevie fifia o.
I’ve done that for myself.	Nye ya mewɔe nenema.
Two things are bothering me.	Nu eve aɖewo le fu ɖem nam.
But he wasn’t so sure.	Gake meka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o.
But it is in a good location.	Gake ele teƒe nyui aɖe.
Something good was going on.	Nu nyui aɖe nɔ edzi yim.
But I was very interested.	Gake metsɔ ɖe le eme vevie.
This can be interesting after all.	Esia ate ŋu ado dzidzɔ na ame le nyateƒe me.
Maybe you are that person who can help them.	Ðewohĩ wòe nye ame ma si ate ŋu akpe ɖe wo ŋu.
But he couldn’t run.	Gake mete ŋu ƒu du o.
I looked like a child.	Medze abe ɖevi ene.
Not necessarily in the same place.	Menye teƒe ɖeka kokoko o.
I do this often.	Mewɔa esia zi geɖe.
That works, too.	Ema hã wɔa dɔ.
What do you think of this book?	Nukae nèsusu tso agbalẽ sia ŋu?
Its not there.	Eƒe menye afima o.
There is no ship.	Meli o.
The fetus died a day later.	Fu la ku le ŋkeke ɖeka megbe.
And we could go on all day.	Eye míate ŋu ayi edzi ŋkeke bliboa.
More people drove to work.	Ame geɖe wu tsɔ ʋu yi dɔme.
You can sort of handle it all.	Àte ŋu akpɔ wo katã gbɔ le mɔ aɖe nu.
There are four rooms in the house.	Xɔ ene le aƒea me.
I get on well with all of them.	Mewɔa nu nyuie kple wo katã.
It’s a bad thing.	Enye nu gbegblẽ.
Many of us died, and many more of them.	Mía dometɔ geɖe ku, eye wo dometɔ geɖe wu ku.
If you don’t want to do that.	Ne mèdi be yeawɔ ema o la.
He couldn’t hear what it was.	Mete ŋu se nusi wònye o.
Tell me something else.	Gblɔ nya bubu aɖe nam.
I'm the one to handle this.	Nyee nye amesi akpɔ esia gbɔ.
I also know he needs you.	Menya hã be ehiã wò.
Like a little child.	Abe ɖevi sue aɖe ene.
But it doesn’t really do anything.	Gake mewɔa naneke ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Maybe you like his back.	Ðewohĩ eƒe megbe dzɔa dzi na wò.
That’s a problem.	Ema nye kuxi.
Now, give us the money.	Azɔ, na ga la mí.
His voice suddenly cleared.	Eƒe gbe me kɔ zi ɖeka.
I think that was a mistake.	Mesusu be vodada aɖee nye ema.
And the.	Eye la.
What a waste of time.	Ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ kae nye si.
But again, it's personal.	Gake le afisia hã la, enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
It’s happened before.	Edzɔ kpɔ.
Over and over, and over, and over again.	Zi geɖe, kple zi gbɔ zi geɖe, kple zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
A lot of people here share your opinion.	Ame geɖe le afisia gblɔ wò susu.
It is a clear one.	Enye esi me kɔ.
No one can do it for us.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔe na mí o.
And that’s not obvious at all.	Eye ema medze ƒã kura o.
I believe in fair taxes.	Mexɔ adzɔ si sɔ dzi se.
That worked well, but it was a lot of work.	Ema wɔ dɔ nyuie, gake enye dɔ geɖe.
And another, if necessary.	Eye bubu hã, ne ehiã.
It is giving the following error.	Ele vodada si gbɔna la nam.
He can’t understand what’s wrong.	Mate ŋu ase nusi gblẽ gɔme o.
Not in the room, or inside.	Menye le xɔa me o, alo le eme hã o.
I don’t want to live in this house.	Nyemedi be manɔ aƒe sia me o.
He held his meeting at two o'clock.	Ewɔ eƒe kpekpea le ga eve me.
Some people are different.	Ame aɖewo to vovo.
That must have passed him by.	Ema anya to eŋu.
I think this whole thing goes much further than that.	Mesusu be nya sia katã yi ŋgɔ wu ema kura.
You just want to have smoke.	Ðeko nèdi be dzudzɔ nanɔ ye si.
Be real, real and real.	Nye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ, ame ŋutɔŋutɔ kple ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I never wanted to let go.	Nyemedi gbeɖe be maɖe asi le eŋu o.
It’s a simple thing.	Enye nusi le bɔbɔe.
Some good stuff.	Nu nyui aɖewo.
He tried, yet somehow he couldn’t look away.	Edze agbagba, ke hã le mɔ aɖe nu la, mete ŋu ɖe ŋku ɖa o.
I’ve already put you through a lot.	Metsɔ wò to nu geɖe me xoxo.
He agreed with her.	Ewɔ ɖeka kplii.
The air has changed.	Ya la trɔ.
Someone was waiting for him.	Ame aɖe nɔ lalam nɛ.
But not in my case.	Gake menye le nye nya nu o.
Not for me.	Menye nam o.
No one really knew what to do.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi wòawɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I know men who enjoy it.	Menya ŋutsu siwo kpɔa dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu.
I will do that.	Mawɔe nenema.
There was so much to do!	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi woawɔ!
But it’s not this.	Gake menye esia o.
I guess this is also curious.	Mesusu be esia hã nye didi be manya nu.
I lost my teaching job.	Nye nufiala ƒe dɔa bu.
That all seems normal.	Edze abe ema katã sɔ ene.
There is very little blood.	Ʋu sue aɖe koe le afima.
No one believed me.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ dzinye se o.
It seems like a great deal to me.	Edze nam abe nu gã aɖee wònye ene.
We cannot discuss this here.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu tso esia ŋu le afisia o.
Which is.	Nusi nye.
Something is over.	Nane wu enu.
Be the guy who is always there to get things done.	Nye ŋutsu si nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi be yeawɔ nuwo.
About where you are.	Le afi si nèle ŋu.
But it is very important.	Gake ele vevie ŋutɔ.
I didn’t see much.	Nyemekpɔ nu geɖe o.
This is true, to some extent.	Esia nye nyateƒe, vaseɖe afi aɖe.
Which means it’s there.	Nusi fia be ele afima.
But his head was already there.	Gake eƒe ta nɔ afima xoxo.
Maybe not so well.	Ðewohĩ menye nyuie nenema gbegbe o.
I'm trying like it's right.	Mele agbagba dzem abe ɖe wòle eteƒe ene.
However, we can say more.	Ke hã, míate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe wu.
I am working on the same now.	Mele dɔ wɔm tso nu ma ke ŋu fifia.
But this time things are a little different.	Gake fifia ya, nuwo to vovo vie.
I’ll do it for you.	Mawɔe na wò.
It’s just these rules.	Se siawo koe wònye.
This probably won’t surprise you at this point.	Anɔ eme be esia mawɔ nuku na wò le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
You have to be nice to me, not the other way around.	Ele be nàwɔ nu nyui nam, ke menye le mɔ bubu nu o.
Quite the opposite, if anything.	Nusi to vovo kura na ema, ne nane li la.
Buy that dress.	Ƒle awu ma.
I am very confident in it.	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
This is very worthy of me.	Esia dze nam ŋutɔ.
He’s not the only one who’s done wrong here.	Menye eya ɖeka koe wɔ nu gbegblẽ le afisia o.
It would be a great thing.	Anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Salt is essential to life.	Dze hiã vevie na agbe.
And indeed they are.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, wole nenema.
It’s like that.	Ele nenema.
Somehow it doesn’t seem to matter.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, edze abe mele vevie o ene.
I’m fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam.
Otherwise, who knows.	Ne menye nenema o la, amekae nya.
I have to work you into it.	Ele be mawɔ dɔ na wò le eme.
You too .	Wo hã .
And this book is definitely interesting.	Eye agbalẽ sia doa dzidzɔ na ame godoo.
There is no root at all.	Ke aɖeke kura meli o.
You can pray for us.	Àte ŋu ado gbe ɖa ɖe mía ta.
I recognized you.	Mekpɔ wò dze sii.
I want to talk about you.	Medi be maƒo nu tso ŋuwò.
The necessary support was not available.	Kpekpeɖeŋu si hiã la menɔ anyi o.
Now move on, little dog.	Azɔ ʋu yi edzi, avu sue.
Again, nothing complicated.	Le afisia hã la, nu sesẽ aɖeke mele eme o.
And doing so has been very rewarding.	Eye esia wɔwɔ ɖe vi geɖe nam.
I don't know what this error says.	Nyemenya nusi vodada sia gblɔ o.
Such a waste of time.	Ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ alea.
I want to do the right thing.	Medi be mawɔ nu si le eteƒe.
But this book sounds good to me.	Gake agbalẽ sia ɖi nu nyui aɖe nam.
The one who laughed at him.	Ame si ko nu nɛ la.
I met him, too.	Medo go eya hã.
They are all lost.	Wo katã bu.
I remember the last time people came.	Meɖo ŋku zi mamlɛtɔ si amewo va la dzi.
It is clearly on the rise.	Edze ƒã be ele dzi yim.
We don’t have any food.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke mele mía si o.
It looks like you.	Edze abe wò ene.
Inside is without, without is inside.	Eme nye manɔmee, manɔmee nye eme.
He will not ride in time.	Mado sɔ le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe o.
It had no water at all.	Tsi menɔ eŋu kura o.
Everything is fine.	Nusianu le nyuie.
I can’t keep him focused.	Nyemate ŋu ana eƒe susu nanɔ nu ŋu o.
He is not the right person.	Menye ame si sɔ o.
Too many people don’t.	Ame geɖe akpa mewɔa esia o.
The whole gun thing got me thinking.	Tu ƒe nya bliboa na meva susu me nam.
And maybe only two people at that.	Eye ɖewohĩ ame eve koe le ema me.
And I'm not sure if you can help with these two issues.	Eye nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be àte ŋu akpe asi ɖe nya eve siawo ŋu o.
There’s something here for everyone.	Nane le afisia na amesiame.
Maybe it will work.	Ðewohĩ awɔ dɔ.
I think every man should have one.	Mesusu be ele be ɖeka nanɔ ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe si.
At home.	Le aƒeme.
I'll tell you what we're doing here.	Magblɔ nu si wɔm míele le afisia la na mi.
He has treated you harshly.	Ewɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋuwò sesĩe.
That’s been going on for a long time.	Ema le edzi yim ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
Spend hours and hours on it.	Zã gaƒoƒo kple gaƒoƒo geɖe ɖe eŋu.
This is going to take a very long time.	Esia axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ.
That time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi ma va yi.
This is none of my business.	Esia menye nye nya aɖeke o.
There is nothing he can do now.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ fifia o.
I knew what he would do.	Menya nusi wòawɔ.
It’s not enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
Now about that gun.	Azɔ le tu ma ŋu.
Not water, not air, nothing.	Menye tsi o, menye ya o, naneke meli o.
I liked that.	Ema dze ŋunye.
Tomorrow will be another tough day.	Etsɔ anye ŋkeke sesẽ bubu.
I’ve done something wrong.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ.
These conditions are numerous.	Nɔnɔme siawo sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
The place is good.	Teƒe nyo.
He is very busy and does not have time for this.	Vovo mele eŋu kura o eye ɣeyiɣi mele esi na esia o.
This is a great opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖee nye esia.
He didn’t say much.	Megblɔ nya geɖe o.
Everyone said he had my face.	Amesiame gblɔ be nye mo le esi.
Do something else.	Wɔ nu bubu aɖe.
Make appropriate arrangements for this matter.	Wɔ ɖoɖo si sɔ ɖe nya sia ŋu.
I have nothing for you.	Naneke mele asinye na wò o.
He'll be here in two weeks.	Ava afisia le kwasiɖa eve megbe.
It was a nice place.	Enye teƒe nyui aɖe.
But we will make mistakes.	Gake míawɔ vodada.
Hopefully that is correct.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be nya ma sɔ.
You can find out more about it here.	Àte ŋu anya nu geɖe tso eŋu le afisia.
It was a very long time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
Not in any way, not at any time.	Menye le mɔ aɖeke nu o, menye le ɣeyiɣi aɖeke me o.
But the opposite happened.	Gake nusi to vovo kura na ema dzɔ.
Neither did he, of course.	Eya hã mewɔe nenema o, le nyateƒe me.
That was what surprised him.	Emae nye nusi wɔ nuku nɛ.
Dispose of them thoroughly.	Tsɔ wo ƒu gbe nyuie.
There is no way that is different from a lie.	Mɔ aɖeke meli si dzi ema to vovo tso alakpa gbɔ o.
The bill will be passed next month.	Woawɔ se sia le ɣleti si gbɔna me.
Maybe this will help you.	Ðewohĩ esia akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
It is working now.	Ele dɔ wɔm fifia.
I could remember that .	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi be .
He won’t tell you anything bad about himself, of course.	Magblɔ nya gbegblẽ aɖeke tso eɖokui ŋu na wò ya o.
Which took me months to do.	Nusi xɔ ɣleti geɖe hafi mete ŋu wɔe.
Someone else made that happen.	Ame bubu aɖee na ema va eme.
How to ‘do’.	Alesi ‘woawɔ’.
Everything he did was right.	Nu sia nu si wòwɔ la sɔ.
It’s really personal.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He may not be able to see anything.	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu akpɔ naneke o.
I have no one else to help me.	Ame bubu aɖeke mele asinye akpe ɖe ŋunye o.
And so it is.	Eye nenema ke.
This does not seem to be the case.	Edze abe esia mele alea o ene.
These two devices usually work together.	Zi geɖe la, mɔ̃ eve siawo wɔa dɔ ɖekae.
I was four years old.	Mexɔ ƒe ene.
This becomes especially important when a device goes missing.	Esia va nɔa vevie ŋutɔ ne mɔ̃ aɖe bu.
It can’t get enough air.	Mete ŋu xɔa ya si sɔ gbɔ o.
His face seemed longer.	Edze abe eƒe mo didi wu ene.
It was too personal, too personal.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa, enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa.
This would have taken hours.	Esia axɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe hafi.
He had the house.	Aƒea nɔ esi.
The good guy is back.	Ame nyui la trɔ gbɔ.
Which is absurd.	Nusi nye nusi me susu mele o.
I do not know.	Nye menya o.
This is so simple.	Esia le bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
Or you can stay right where you are.	Alo àte ŋu anɔ afi si tututu nèle.
Like any child.	Abe ɖevi ɖesiaɖe ene.
And it was a small thing.	Eye nu sue aɖe koe wònye.
He seems to be right about that too.	Edze abe eƒe nya le eteƒe le nya ma hã ŋu ene.
This is a difficult problem.	Esia nye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
Something has changed.	Nane trɔ.
The whole city came into existence.	Du bliboa va dzɔ.
Like someone planned them that way.	Abe alesi ame aɖe wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe wo ŋu nenema ene.
Looks like a fire is needed.	Edze abe dzo aɖe hiã ene.
I am applying for a lot of jobs now.	Mele dɔ geɖe biam fifia.
I have been here all this time.	Menɔ afisia ɣeyiɣi sia katã.
They are intertwined.	Wole wo nɔewo ŋu.
The room looked very old.	Edze abe xɔa me do xoxo ŋutɔ ene.
Almost no one knows about you.	Ame aɖeke kloe menya nu tso ŋuwò o.
It is now officially on the market.	Ele asi me le se nu fifia.
He had work in the morning.	Dɔ nɔ esi le ŋdi me.
The truth mattered.	Nyateƒea nɔ vevie.
But this is about more than that.	Gake esia ku ɖe nusi yi ŋgɔ wu ema ŋu.
And that may well be right.	Eye ɖewohĩ nya ma sɔ ŋutɔ.
I don’t know how to fight this.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ avu kple esia o.
He couldn’t leave.	Mete ŋu dzo o.
We have to do a better job of it.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ si nyo wu le eŋu.
How could he escape?	Aleke wòate ŋu asi?
And as such, everything is working just fine.	Eye abe alea ene la, nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie ko.
You can usually do this yourself.	Zi geɖe la, wò ŋutɔ àte ŋu awɔ esia.
These horses are very expensive.	Sɔ siawo xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I can only imagine what they are doing.	Nusi wɔm wole la koe mate ŋu akpɔ le susu me.
The issue is getting deeper.	Nya la le to yim.
I will let myself go out.	Maɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu be mado go.
I don’t know which is which.	Nyemenya esi nye esi o.
I got to eat.	Mekpɔ mɔ aɖu nu.
Do it better if you can.	Wɔe nyuie wu ne àte ŋui.
I was so excited.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ alea gbegbe.
Please go, now.	Taflatse yi, fifia.
He's waiting.	Ele lalam.
No one else can do it for you.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu awɔe na wò o.
In.	Eme.
That’s the end of it.	Emae wu enu.
He didn’t do anything.	Mewɔ naneke o.
Every year he had a new machine.	Ƒe sia ƒe la, mɔ̃ yeye aɖe nɔ esi.
But maybe he wasn't serious.	Gake ɖewohĩ menye ɖe wònɔ nu ƒom vevie o.
They’re all here!	Wo katã wole afisia!
He wasn't going to forget that.	Menye ɖe wònɔ ema ŋlɔ ge be o.
Is there anyone there?	Ðe ame aɖe le afima?
That’s why we’re giving it to you.	Esia tae míele wò nam.
And so did everyone else.	Eye ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã wɔe nenema.
He did not give his name to the sender.	Metsɔ eƒe ŋkɔ na ame si ɖoe ɖa la o.
But now there is something else.	Gake fifia nu bubu aɖe hã li.
He can do it.	Ate ŋu awɔe.
There are times when.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖewo li siwo me.
This has been going on for almost two years.	Esia le edzi yim ƒe eve kloe enye sia.
It was quite a system.	Enye ɖoɖo aɖe ŋutɔ.
I didn’t get a job because of this.	Nyemekpɔ dɔ le esia ta o.
It is, what it is.	Enye, nusi wònye.
This room is very small.	Xɔ sia le sue ŋutɔ.
But I couldn’t find it.	Gake nyemete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
One project at a time.	Dɔ ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
This is another one of these things.	Esia hã nye nu siawo dometɔ bubu.
But he didn’t answer.	Gake meɖo eŋu o.
Give them a little encouragement.	De dzi ƒo na wo vie.
This salt is fine as sand.	Dze sia le nyuie abe ke ene.
Not just any water though.	Menye tsi ɖesiaɖe koe o ke hã.
Or whatever you want.	Alo nusi nèdi.
Just like it used to be.	Abe alesi wònɔ tsã ene.
But there was very little in that.	Gake nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ ema me.
That’s a good idea.	Ema nye susu nyui.
Just think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ ko.
The day lives another day.	Ŋkeke la nɔa agbe ŋkeke bubu.
I make breakfast.	Mewɔa ŋdi nuɖuɖu.
This time is very close.	Ɣeyiɣi sia te ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ.
Some have already done so.	Ame aɖewo wɔe nenema xoxo.
In some ways, they are.	Le mɔ aɖewo nu la, wole nenema.
But now that’s going to be hard.	Gake fifia ya la, ema ava sesẽ.
None of us could do any damage.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mete ŋu gblẽ nu le ame ŋu le mɔ aɖe nu o.
In fact, it is more important.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele vevie wu.
That was really about him.	Ema ku ɖe eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The good news is.	Nya nyui la.
It won’t be like that.	Manɔ nenema o.
You can’t with this.	Màte ŋui kple esia o.
I owned them on day one.	Nyee nye wo tɔ le ŋkeke gbãtɔ dzi.
No one was talking.	Ame aɖeke menɔ nu ƒom o.
Time is money.	Ɣeyiɣi nye ga.
I only saw them live twice.	Zi eve koe mekpɔ wo le agbe.
I know his character.	Menya eƒe nɔnɔme.
I will go on my own.	Mayi le ɖokuinye si.
I never had much in my life.	Nu geɖe menɔ asinye le nye agbe me kpɔ o.
I miss what used to be.	Nusi nɔ anyi tsã la to ŋunye.
No one is like that.	Ame aɖeke mele nenema o.
He had kept his word.	Ewɔ ɖe eƒe nya dzi kpɔ.
It’s really not that surprising.	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔ nuku nenema gbegbe o.
I just need to know what it is.	Ðeko wòle be manya nusi wònye.
He didn’t care about his job.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eƒe dɔa me o.
He is biding his time.	Ele eƒe ɣeyiɣi lalam.
It’s a tough one, tough.	Enye nya sesẽ aɖe, sesẽ.
There was only now.	Fifia koe nɔ anyi.
I had never felt anything like that.	Nyemese naneke le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o.
This thing can be big or small.	Nu sia ate ŋu anye gã alo sue.
Many people greeted me.	Ame geɖe do gbe nam.
It seems pretty obvious to me.	Edze nam be edze ƒã ŋutɔ.
If you have any questions, please let me know.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò la, taflatse na manya.
I can’t explain what’s going on here.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nusi le edzi yim le afisia me o.
His voice is still soft.	Eƒe gbe gakpɔtɔ le bɔbɔe.
Canned foods are usually high in sugar.	Zi geɖe la, dze sɔ gbɔ ɖe nuɖuɖu siwo le go me me.
I couldn’t find any errors.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ vodada aɖeke o.
I seem to be having a bad hair day.	Edze abe ɖa ƒe ŋkeke gbegblẽ aɖe le dzinye ene.
It only lasted one season.	Ɣeyiɣi ɖeka koe wònɔ anyi.
He is in the car.	Eya le ʋua me.
Many people were very happy.	Ame geɖe kpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
Take a look at something.	Lé ŋku ɖe nane ŋu.
I would be happy for anything.	Adzɔ dzi nam ɖe nusianu ta.
But his face was amazing.	Gake eƒe mo wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He didn’t hear a word.	Mese nya aɖeke o.
But he can’t do anything.	Gake mate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
Now he was the only one standing there.	Fifia eya koe tsi tre ɖe afima.
We have to work out how to get out of here.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ tso alesi míawɔ ado le afisia ŋu.
Compare this to last month.	Tsɔ esia sɔ kple ɣleti si va yi.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
I work as a teacher.	Mewɔa dɔ abe nufiala ene.
Not quite yet.	Menye tututu haɖe o.
No one could hear his voice.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu se eƒe gbe o.
He was a good guy.	Enye ame nyui aɖe.
The highway plays a big role in our lives.	Mɔ gã la wɔa akpa gã aɖe le míaƒe agbe me.
I really have no idea what it could be.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi wòate ŋu anye o.
But this really makes it clear.	Gake esia na eme kɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But this time he did nothing to do it.	Gake fifia ya mewɔ naneke tsɔ wɔe o.
That summer everything changed.	Le dzomeŋɔli ma me la, nusianu trɔ.
I want you now.	Medi wò fifia.
Please let me know what to do.	Taflatse na manya nusi mawɔ.
It was a very difficult job.	Enye dɔ sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
They never had any time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ wo si kpɔ o.
I'm sure of it.	Meka ɖe edzi.
I wondered where he could go at this time of night.	Mebia ɖokuinye be afikae wòate ŋu ayi le zã ƒe ɣeyiɣi sia me hã.
It’s been a week.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia.
Surprise her tonight.	Na wòawɔ nuku nɛ le zã sia me.
More than we ever had.	Nu geɖe wu esi nɔ mía si kpɔ.
We can talk about anything together.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu tso nusianu ŋu ɖekae.
You are my rock.	Wòe nye nye kpe.
You can’t control it.	Màte ŋu aɖu edzi o.
There was no one ahead of him.	Ame aɖeke menɔ ŋgɔ nɛ o.
Every one of them is wrong.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe nye nu gbegblẽ.
I'm fine with it.	Mele nyuie le eŋu.
The opposite of that.	Nusi to vovo na ema.
I want them all.	Medi be wo katã.
In fact, many teachers were.	Le nyateƒe me la, nufiala geɖe nɔ nenema.
I am sure you will do the same.	Meka ɖe edzi be wò hã nàwɔ nu ma ke.
There is no problem.	Kuxi aɖeke meli o.
You can’t control it.	Màte ŋu aɖu edzi o.
This will not work.	Esia mawɔ dɔ o.
We’re on the same side here.	Míele akpa ɖeka dzi le afisia.
It was a wonderful time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
The project is too small.	Dɔa le sue akpa.
Not sure what the first one was.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi gbãtɔ nye dzi o.
This is a serious mistake.	Esia nye vodada gã aɖe.
But he didn’t do it often.	Gake mewɔe zi geɖe o.
Anyway.	Ɖe sia ɖe ko.
The result pleased the king.	Nusi do tso eme la kpɔ dzidzɔ fia la ŋutɔ.
Any man with a heart would have done it.	Ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe si si dzi le la awɔe hafi.
He was every man for himself.	Enye ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe na eɖokui.
Here the following is in order.	Le afisia la, nya siwo gbɔna la le ɖoɖo nu.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
And there were a few others that were also close.	Eye bubu ʋɛ aɖewo hã nɔ anyi siwo hã te ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
It is not true at all.	Menye nyateƒe kura o.
Like you were part of it or something.	Abe ɖe nènye eƒe akpa aɖe alo nane ene.
I personally don’t want anything to do with them.	Nye ŋutɔ nyemedi be naneke nanɔ asinye kple wo o.
I'm fine with that	Mele nyuie be .
This is really quite amazing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I know it’s a problem.	Menya be enye kuxi.
Think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
Who could be the culprit?	Amekae ate ŋu anye amesi ɖi fɔ?
This is why we are fighting.	Esia tae míele avu wɔm ɖo.
I thought something must be ‘wrong’ with me.	Mesusu be nane anya ‘gblẽ’ le ŋunye.
On the other hand, they are small.	Le go bubu me la, wole sue.
That’s a lost opportunity.	Ema nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ si bu.
Just a few days ago.	Ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe nye esia.
It doesn’t really matter to them.	Mele vevie na wo ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Dismiss any other thoughts.	Ðe susu bubu ɖesiaɖe ɖa.
The king was very pleased with himself.	Fia la kpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eɖokui ŋu ŋutɔ.
This if very often a problem.	Esia nenye be zi geɖe ŋutɔ la, enye kuxi.
Probably not possible, actually.	Ðewohĩ manya wɔ o, le nyateƒe me.
In the long run, the truth will come out.	Le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe megbe la, nyateƒea ado go.
That’s like, the opposite.	Ema le abe, nusi tsi tre ɖe eŋu ene.
It was never true.	Menye nyateƒe gbeɖe o.
If that happens, it will be great.	Ne edzɔ alea la, anyo ŋutɔ.
Write this and it’s a great piece.	Ŋlɔ esia eye wònye akpa gã aɖe.
The police won’t be here.	Kpovitɔwo mava afisia o.
They had a car in your possession.	Ʋu aɖe nɔ wo si le asiwò.
Do the right thing for you.	Wɔ nu nyui na wò.
These days will exist without name or place or time.	Ŋkeke siawo anɔ anyi ŋkɔ alo teƒe alo ɣeyiɣi aɖeke manɔmee.
I was very busy for once.	Vovo menɔ ŋunye ŋutɔ zi ɖeka.
And in that order.	Eye le ɖoɖo ma nu.
We have no further information.	Nya bubu aɖeke mele mía si o.
Take one.	Tsɔ ɖeka.
He was so surprised that he could not speak.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ale gbegbe be mete ŋu ƒo nu o.
Every season is different.	Ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
That’s definitely difficult.	Ema sesẽ godoo.
Your death is nothing to them.	Wò ku menye naneke na wo o.
I don’t want more fighting.	Nyemedi be woawɔ avu geɖe wu o.
Not a very talkative person.	Menye ame si ƒoa nu ŋutɔ o.
He shouldn’t be alone.	Mele be eya ɖeka nanɔ anyi o.
Quite the opposite.	Nusi to vovo kura na ema.
This guy has none of it.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele ŋutsu sia si o.
I will be there and.	Manɔ afima eye.
Time is not on your side.	Ɣeyiɣi mele wò akpa dzi o.
I want your name on that child.	Medi be wò ŋkɔ nanɔ ɖevi ma ŋu.
But something more is going on.	Gake nane si de ŋgɔ wu ema le edzi yim.
I like that about you.	Ema dzɔa dzi nam le ŋuwò.
Nothing lasted more than a while.	Naneke menɔ anyi wu ɣeyiɣi aɖe o.
This will be a snake to work with.	Esia anye da si ŋu wòawɔ dɔ le.
I have to go to work.	Ele be mayi dɔme.
He wouldn’t let go.	Maɖe asi le eŋu o.
However, it is not that easy.	Ke hã, mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
It seems like a long time ago.	Edze abe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia ene.
I just wanted to live.	Ðeko medi be manɔ agbe.
It is very passive.	Enye nusi mewɔa naneke o ŋutɔ.
Another day, a few hours.	Gbe bubu, gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo.
Life is good, life is very good.	Agbe nyo, agbe nyo ŋutɔ.
I mean, that doesn’t look too good.	Megblɔ be, esia medze nyuie akpa o.
Or maybe he had something else in mind.	Alo ɖewohĩ nu bubu aɖe nɔ susu me nɛ.
Let him do what he has to do.	Na wòawɔ nu si wòle be wòawɔ.
There is no reason either.	Susu aɖeke hã meli o.
Get closer to me.	Te ɖe ŋunye.
You said it was amazing.	Ègblɔ be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I was annoyed.	Medo dziku nam.
It didn’t bother me that much.	Meɖe fu nam nenema gbegbe o.
That will take some time.	Ema axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
This has gone too far.	Esia yi ŋgɔ akpa.
Talk him through it.	Ƒo nu nɛ to eme.
No one survived.	Ame aɖeke metsi agbe o.
Or some kind of car.	Alo ʋu aɖe ƒomevi.
This is a new one.	Esia nye yeye.
I knew exactly what he wanted.	Menya nusi tututu dim wònɔ.
Please, please help.	Taflatse, taflatse kpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I fell down.	Medze anyi.
He has nothing to lose.	Naneke mele esi o.
This is a great house.	Aƒe gã aɖee nye esia.
He couldn’t allow it.	Mete ŋu ɖe mɔ ɖe eŋu o.
It’s not clear we can do this.	Me me kɔ be míate ŋu awɔ esia o.
But here is my concern.	Gake nusi ŋu metsi dzi ɖoe nye esia.
It made sense, after that.	Susu nɔ eme, le ema megbe.
I hope you do the same!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wò hã nàwɔ nenema ke!.
Good morning everyone.	Ŋdi nyui na ame sia ame.
There will be very few.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe anɔ anyi.
It can’t be much better for him.	Mate ŋu anyo nɛ boo o.
That was clear enough.	Ema me kɔ nyuie ale gbegbe.
I really don’t know what was on his mind.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi nɔ eƒe susu me o.
We were almost hit by a car.	Ʋu aɖe ƒo mí kloe.
That is a possibility.	Ema nye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ.
She has the dress and everything.	Awu la kple nusianu le esi.
And it can be that way.	Eye ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
I was in the room.	Menɔ xɔa me.
But that might be a bit of an exaggeration.	Gake ema ate ŋu anye nusi gbɔ eme vie.
This year is nothing new.	Ƒe sia menye nu yeye o.
The result is obvious.	Nusi ado tso eme la dze ƒã.
He couldn’t go any further.	Mete ŋu yi ŋgɔ wu ema o.
Or at least it used to be.	Alo nenema ya teti tsã.
I was there for that.	Menɔ afima ɖe ema ta.
There were no police at all.	Kpovitɔwo menɔ anyi kura o.
Hopefully we can facilitate that.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be míate ŋu ana ema nanɔ bɔbɔe.
A new era is upon us.	Ɣeyiɣi yeye aɖe gbɔna mía dzi.
I could have killed you.	Anye ne mate ŋu awu wò hafi.
You can find what you want there.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusi nèdi le afima.
Maybe that’s a good thing.	Ðewohĩ nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
A strict diet needs to be followed.	Ehiã be woawɔ ɖe nuɖuɖu sesẽ aɖe dzi.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
But it’s not that much.	Gake menye nenema gbegbe o.
Only you can do this for me.	Wò ɖeka koe ate ŋu awɔ esia nam.
Nice to finally meet you.	Enye dzidzɔ nam be medo go wò mlɔeba.
Mary went inside.	Maria ge ɖe eme.
He can’t talk to her.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu kplii o.
But he has to have time.	Gake ele be ɣeyiɣi nanɔ esi.
There is no room for error.	Vodada ƒe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke meli o.
It’s like everything else.	Ele abe nusianu ene.

I found myself in that exact situation.	Mekpɔ ɖokuinye le nɔnɔme ma tututu me.
And for a great job.	Eye le dɔ gã aɖe ta.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.

There is no book that can do it for you.	Agbalẽ aɖeke meli si ate ŋu awɔe na wò o.
You can find them here.	Àte ŋu akpɔ wo le afisia.
Somehow he had missed something.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, nane to eŋu kpɔ.
For obvious reasons.	Le susu siwo dze ƒã ta.
This may be the case.	Esia ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
There was more than that.	Nu geɖe wu ema nɔ anyi.
One short one coming up.	Kpuie ɖeka si gbɔna.
This can help someone if needed.	Esia ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame aɖe ŋu ne ehiã.
We can put the matter this way.	Míate ŋu agblɔ nya la ale.
It just won’t do that.	Ðeko mawɔe nenema o.
And some other big rocks.	Eye kpe gã bubu aɖewo hã.
But you know what it’s like.	Gake ènya alesi wòle.
It’s everything to these guys.	Enye nusianu na ŋutsu siawo.
I'm not quite sure exactly how to do that though.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi tututu mawɔ ema dzi tututu o ke hã.
It’s not my head.	Menye nye tae o.
He has a real attitude.	Nɔnɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe le esi.
And that’s the last one.	Eye emae nye mamlɛtɔ.
There is a lot of truth to it.	Nyateƒe geɖe le eŋu.
It’s a really good thing.	Enye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
More important than anything.	Hiã wu nusianu.
Something he would never do.	Nane si mawɔ gbeɖe o.
We can do this in two ways.	Míate ŋu awɔ esia le mɔ eve nu.
My eyes were on it.	Nye ŋku nɔ eme.
It’s all or nothing.	Enye nusianu alo naneke o.
But he couldn't turn back now.	Gake mete ŋu trɔ ɖe megbe fifia o.
Be very careful!	Kpɔ nyuie ŋutɔ!
I could see right there.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu le afima tututu.
There are many chapters in it.	Ta geɖe le eme.
We don’t have enough money.	Ga si sɔ gbɔ mele mía si o.
I have my life in mind.	Nye agbe le susu me nam.
And there’s a lot to that.	Eye nu geɖe le ema ŋu.
This is a personal matter.	Esia nye ame ŋutɔ ƒe nya.
More time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu va yi.
These rules exist for a reason.	Susu aɖe tae se siawo li ɖo.
Twice, in one direction.	Zi eve, le mɔ ɖeka dzi.
He didn't look at anything.	Etsɔ ŋku ɖe naneke ŋu o.
Do it anyway.	Wɔe le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
There are no real jobs.	Dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke mele afima o.
I know this voice.	Menya gbe sia.
This means now.	Esia fia fifia.
It’s wonderful, all of it.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, wo katã.
How long has he been planning this?	Ɣeyiɣi didi kae wòle ɖoɖo wɔm ɖe esia ŋu?
There is no better word.	Nya aɖeke meli si nyo wu ema o.
He didn’t doubt anything.	Meke ɖi naneke o.
The first course should be easy.	Ele be nuɖuɖu gbãtɔ nanɔ bɔbɔe.
This is definitely true for me.	Esia nye nyateƒe nam godoo.
The whole town came to a conclusion at the same time.	Du bliboa va ƒo nya ta le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka ma ke me.
After a few hours.	Le gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo megbe.
His mouth fell off.	Eƒe nu dze anyi.
Some went up just a few hours earlier.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo yi dzi gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo ko do ŋgɔ.
I am in no mood .	Nyemele nɔnɔme aɖeke me o .

Something bad happened.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖe dzɔ.
I can’t, not like he can.	Nyemate ŋui o, menye abe alesi wòate ŋui ene o.
It didn’t work.	Mewɔ dɔ o.
I couldn’t do anything right at the moment.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke nyuie le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
And happiness, too.	Eye dzidzɔ hã.

I really don’t know what to do with myself.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi mawɔ ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o.
Let’s do something.	Mina míawɔ nane.
They had had a horse for him.	Sɔ aɖe nɔ wo si nɛ kpɔ.
These words are very difficult to make.	Nya siawo wɔwɔ sesẽ ŋutɔ.
The same can happen.	Nenema ke wòate ŋu adzɔ hã.
We have to work now.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ fifia.
I needed his help.	Mehiã eƒe kpekpeɖeŋu.
He liked his money.	Eƒe ga dze eŋu.
I felt satisfied.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme.
I don’t want to go there.	Nyemedi be mayi afima o.
We are having a great time.	Míele dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔ.
One of two ways.	Mɔ eve aɖewo dometɔ ɖeka.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
The reality is quite the opposite.	Nyateƒea to vovo kura na ema.
I'm wearing a dress.	Medo awu.
I am new to this.	Nyee nye ame yeye le esia me.
That’s all I have to say.	Ema koe nye nye nya.
But not over and over again.	Gake menye zi gbɔ zi geɖe o.
People died there.	Amewo ku le afima.
And that’s just water.	Eye tsi koe nye ema.
There is no root.	Ke aɖeke meli o.
None of us knew what was going on.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke menya nusi nɔ edzi yim o.
Help help him out.	Kpe kpe ɖe eŋu.
They are working on this.	Wole dɔ wɔm tso esia ŋu.
I too am a minority.	Nye hã menye ame ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
Most of the time he didn’t.	Zi geɖe la, mewɔe nenema o.
He couldn’t think of it.	Mete ŋu bu eŋu kpɔ o.
At home, that’s easy.	Le aƒeme la, ema le bɔbɔe.
I think it will work well.	Mesusu be awɔ dɔ nyuie.
Please do it.	Taflatse wɔe.
Please, go now.	Meɖe kuku, yi azɔ.
Our house is next to theirs.	Míaƒe aƒea te ɖe wo tɔ ŋu.
None of them works.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔa dɔ o.
He did more than ever.	Ewɔ geɖe wu tsã.
He was a character.	Ame aɖee wònye.
He had no chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke menɔ esi o.
This surprised him completely.	Esia wɔ nuku nɛ kura.
But he is ready to see you.	Gake ele klalo be yeakpɔ wò.
He tried his best to comply.	Edze agbagba ɖesiaɖe be yeawɔ ɖe edzi.
Yet the opposite seems to be the case.	Ke hã edze abe nusi to vovo na emae nye ema ene.
That’s why they had such a hard winter.	Esia tae dzomeŋɔli sesẽ na wo alea gbegbe ɖo.
He didn't hear anything.	Mese naneke o.
Indeed.	Le nyateƒe me.
I finally got this thing running.	Meva na nu sia va nɔ du dzi mlɔeba.
They’re doing really well.	Wole edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But in !!!.	Gake le !!!.
And the opposite error is possible.	Eye vodada si to vovo na ema ate ŋu adzɔ.
The king decreed that all people should work.	Fia la de se be ele be amewo katã nawɔ dɔ.
Perhaps he will do the same.	Ðewohĩ awɔe nenema ke.
Your food has gotten worse.	Wò nuɖuɖu gblẽ ɖe edzi.
Only money does this.	Ga koe wɔa esia.
Finally, someone with some character and prestige.	Mlɔeba la, ame aɖe si si nɔnɔme kple bubu aɖewo le.
A police case.	Kpovitɔwo ƒe nya aɖe.
That’s something else.	Ema nye nu bubu aɖe.
Not now, of course.	Menye fifia ya o.
That is absolutely true.	Ema nye nyateƒe kura.
None of us can live without you right now.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ agbe wò manɔmee fifia o.
He really needed a good time.	Ehiã ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
No one can doubt its difficulty.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu ake ɖi eƒe sesẽ o.
I'm actually looking forward to it.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele mɔ kpɔm na esia vevie.
He can send money home.	Ate ŋu aɖo ga ɖe aƒe.
He couldn’t hold himself back.	Mete ŋu lé eɖokui ɖe te o.
That ends here.	Ema wu enu le afisia.

No one knows.	Ame aɖeke menya o.

That is just a personal matter.	Ame ŋutɔ ƒe nya koe nye ema.
I was confident in myself.	Meka ɖe ɖokuinye dzi.
One room later, more dead bodies.	Xɔ ɖeka megbe, ame kuku geɖe wu.
Pass the salt, please.	Taflatse, to dze la ŋu.
It’s just the truth.	Nyateƒea koe wònye.
He couldn’t allow that.	Mete ŋu ɖe mɔ nenema o.
It is, to some extent.	Enye, vaseɖe afi aɖe.
I was the guy who made that happen.	Nyee nye ŋutsu si na ema dzɔ.
The result is clear.	Nusi do tso eme la me kɔ nyuie.
I took a step back.	Meɖe afɔ ɖeka ɖe megbe.
It is a sufficient rule in itself.	Enye se si sɔ gbɔ le eɖokui si.
In one year, a lot has changed.	Le ƒe ɖeka me la, nu geɖe trɔ.
There wasn’t really much between us.	Nu boo aɖeke menɔ mía dome ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
The busy road divides this small town into two parts.	Mɔ si dzi amewo sɔ gbɔ ɖo la ma du sue sia ɖe akpa eve me.
I do wish him a good year.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na ƒe nyui aɖe nɛ nyateƒe.
Prices have skyrocketed in recent years.	Nuwo ƒe asi yi dzi ŋutɔ le ƒe ʋɛ siwo va yi me.
I know a guy, actually.	Menya ŋutsu aɖe, le nyateƒe me.
I will definitely be doing more of that real soon.	Mawɔ ema dometɔ geɖe kpuie ŋutɔŋutɔ godoo.
You can tell them as much or as little as you want.	Àte ŋu agblɔ nu geɖe alo nu sue aɖe na wo alesi nèdi.
I don’t want you.	Nyemedi wò o.
That means that over the same length of time, some.	Ema fia be le ɣeyiɣi didi ma ke me la, ame aɖewo.
He was annoyed by the work he had done.	Dɔ si wòwɔ la do dziku nɛ.
I could go on and on really.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It's too soon for this.	Enye kaba akpa na esia.
There are two sections in the room.	Akpa eve le xɔa me.
More than a little annoying.	Menye nusi do dziku nam vie ko o.
It can be very helpful.	Ate ŋu akpe ɖe mía ŋu ŋutɔ.
There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eŋu o.
But the whole thing was amazing.	Gake nu bliboa wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That would have been great.	Ema anyo ŋutɔ hafi.
I had never heard of him.	Nyemese eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
You can set up home anywhere.	Àte ŋu aɖo aƒe ɖe afi sia afi.
Everything is dust in the wind .	Nusianu nye ke le ya me .
This is not expensive.	Esia mexɔ asi o.
It’s really, really great.	Enye nu gã ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s been a long time now.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia fifia.
You can do it now.	Àte ŋu awɔe fifia.
But nobody really wants that.	Gake ame aɖeke medi nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He didn’t really care or care about her.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ alo tsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
If they had any.	Ne ɖeke nɔ wo si la.
That book sounds interesting.	Agbalẽ ma ɖi nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame.
It is a worthy place.	Enye teƒe si dze.
Where do you want to go?	Afikae nèdi be yeayi?
I don’t want you to do anything to me.	Nyemedi be nàwɔ naneke nam o.
I'm telling you.	Mese wo.
This place is not a place of honor.	Teƒe sia menye bubu ƒe teƒe o.
I also like the dog.	Avu la hã dzɔa dzi nam.
There was absolutely nothing.	Nu aɖeke menɔ anyi kura o.
The same could be true here.	Ate ŋu anɔ alea le afisia hã.
Which he definitely didn’t.	Nusi mewɔe o godoo.
In fact, that’s all there is to it.	Le nyateƒe me la, eya koe nye nya la.
There will be a time for that.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe anɔ anyi na ema.
You are still you.	Wòe gakpɔtɔ nye wò.
However, it may come earlier.	Ke hã ate ŋu ava do ŋgɔ.
I had this one.	Esia nɔ asinye.
We have to be united.	Ele be míawɔ ɖeka.
He couldn’t see any of them.	Mete ŋu kpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
I'm sure you can do it.	Meka ɖe edzi be àte ŋu awɔe.
Like so many others.	Abe ame geɖe ŋutɔ ene.
I exist, and so do you.	Nyee li, eye wò hã li.
And that’s what people care about.	Eye emae nye nusi ŋu amewo tsɔ ɖe le.
That is also very important.	Ema hã le vevie ŋutɔ.
There were several reasons for this.	Susu geɖe nɔ esia ta.
We each wrote down a wish for the coming year.	Mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ŋlɔ ƒe si gbɔna ƒe didi aɖe ɖi.
I could be more, better.	Mate ŋu anye geɖe wu, anyo wu.
He never does this.	Mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
I am having some issues.	Nya aɖewo le fu ɖem nam.
He is running so fast.	Ele du dzi sesĩe ale gbegbe.
Me too, to some extent.	Nye hã, vaseɖe afi aɖe.
There will be no problems.	Kuxi aɖeke manɔ anyi o.
I will take care of myself.	Makpɔ ɖokuinye dzi.
In fact, in many ways it is quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, le mɔ geɖe nu la, esia to vovo kura.
Think long-term.	Bu nu ŋu le mɔ didi aɖe nu.
He still has a home there.	Aƒe gakpɔtɔ le esi le afima.
There are some innovations in our work.	Nu yeye aɖewo le míaƒe dɔa me.
Try something new!	Te nu yeye aɖe kpɔ!
It doesn’t matter, kid.	Mehiã o, ɖevi.
He just sat there.	Ðeko wònɔ anyi ɖe afima.
You’ve been around a long time.	Èle afima ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
Thanks to everyone who has helped me in this long search.	Akpe na amesiame si kpe ɖe ŋunye le didi didi sia me.
Your name is.	Wò ŋkɔ.
My mind was too busy.	Nye susu nɔ dɔ dzi akpa.
Quit.	Do le eme.
No one can take that away from you.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ ema le asiwò o.
A lot can happen in two months.	Nu geɖe ate ŋu adzɔ le ɣleti eve me.
This is pretty close to that.	Esia te ɖe ema ŋu tututu.
It never works out.	Mewɔa dɔ gbeɖe o.
My voice is fine.	Nye gbe le nyuie.
And it can exist.	Eye ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
That’s pretty clear.	Ema me kɔ nyuie.
It’s not possible.	Manya wɔ o.
But he was also kind.	Gake eya hã nyo dɔme.
Can anyone please advise.	Ðe ame aɖe ate ŋu aɖo aɖaŋu na taflatse.
I am sure that it is.	Meka ɖe edzi be ele nenema.
That was the thing that impressed me the most.	Emae nye nusi wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye wu.
That's me.	Nyee nye ema.
That voice is in my ears.	Gbe ma le nye to me.
He was never in it long enough.	Menɔ eme gbeɖe ɣeyiɣi didi si sɔ o.
It is not necessary in any way.	Mehiã le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I'm not so sure that's true.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe be nya ma nye nyateƒe o.
But it all came down to this moment.	Gake wo katã va ɖo ɣeyiɣi sia me.
Things got worse.	Nuwo va gblẽ ɖe edzi.
Sea on the sea.	Ƒu ɖe ƒu dzi.
Now he needs money.	Fifia ehiã ga.
I objected to that.	Metsi tre ɖe nya ma ŋu.
Not much help.	Menye kpekpeɖeŋu boo aɖeke o.
Why, he doesn’t know.	Nukatae, menya o.
They are unlikely to be doing much more.	Anɔ eme be wole nu geɖe wu wɔm o.
The police were surprised.	Ewɔ nuku na kpovitɔwo.
I have very little of everything.	Nu sue aɖe koe le asinye le nusianu me.
He tried, too.	Edze agbagba hã.
It had been wonderful.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ tsã.
He certainly had his own mind.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe susu nɔ esi godoo.
But maybe things are really different now.	Gake ɖewohĩ nuwo to vovo ŋutɔŋutɔ fifia.
For if that.	Na nenye be.
I was so nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ale gbegbe.
But he couldn’t.	Gake mete ŋui o.
I can’t talk to him.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu kplii o.
That stuff is so much a part of it.	Nu ma nye eƒe akpa aɖe ale gbegbe.
Anyone can be great.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu anye gã.
Is that me? 	Nyee nye ema?
But he didn’t make that mistake.	Gake mewɔ vodada ma o.
But I can’t do that.	Gake nyemate ŋu awɔ ema o.
I can’t imagine who he is.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ amesi wònye le susu me o.
For this, pay close attention to what you are doing.	Le esia ta la, lé ŋku ɖe nusi wɔm nèle ŋu nyuie.
And there’s no time like the present.	Eye ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli abe fifia ene o.
That began to be weird in itself.	Ema te nusi mewɔ nuku o le eɖokui si.
What would you do.	Nukae nàwɔ.
I wonder which one of us it is.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be mía dometɔ kae wònye hã.
He never does this.	Mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
For just one thing.	Nu ɖeka ko ta.
I know this is a minor thing.	Menya be esia nye nu sue aɖe.
Save someone’s life.	Ðe ame aɖe ƒe agbe.
This one works.	Esia wɔa dɔ.
I don’t know anything about it.	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o.
To tell her how much she meant to me.	Be magblɔ alesi gbegbe wòle vevie nam la nɛ.
If only he could see.	Ne ɖe wòate ŋu akpɔ nu ko la.
No one wants to do that.	Ame aɖeke medi be yeawɔ nu ma o.
I know many others who have done it.	Menya ame bubu geɖe siwo wɔe kpɔ.
I could never do it again.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe ake gbeɖe o.
I’ve done them many times before.	Mewɔ wo zi geɖe do ŋgɔ.
Exactly what he didn’t want.	Nusi tututu medi o.
That’s more like this.	Ema sɔ kple esia wu.
I have to do that.	Ele nam be mawɔe nenema.
Everyone here is vehemently opposed to the project.	Amesiame si le afisia tsi tre ɖe dɔa ŋu vevie.
Everyone needs help.	Amesiame hiã kpekpeɖeŋu.
That seems unlikely.	Edze abe ema mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.
We love that place.	Teƒe ma dzɔa dzi na mí ŋutɔ.
We can’t just be together.	Míate ŋu anɔ anyi ɖekae ko o.
There were no guns.	Tu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
There was nothing wrong.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Quite somewhere in fact.	Afi aɖe ŋutɔ le nyateƒe me.
There, now you know.	Afima, fifia ènya.
You can do so much.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
Everything suddenly made sense.	Susu va nɔ nusianu me zi ɖeka.
There wasn’t any of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
You’re not going to get them.	Menye ɖe nèle wo xɔ ge o.
Come now, come now.	Va fifia, va fifia.
He was interested in almost everything.	Etsɔ ɖe le nusianu kloe me.
I would be very happy.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
People fell dead.	Amewo dze anyi ku.
I need to be doing my job.	Ele be manɔ nye dɔ wɔm.
And someone else.	Kple ame bubu aɖe.
These houses are destroyed.	Aƒe siawo gblẽ.
It is my business to know.	Enye nye nya be manya.
No one said anything good.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya nyui aɖeke o.
I don’t mean to offend you all.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mado dziku na mi katã o.
You are a great person.	Ame gã aɖee nènye.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Thank you !.	Akpe na wò !.
I understood that far.	Mese egɔme vaseɖe afima.
The point is correct.	Nya la sɔ.
This is just one of them.	Esia nye ɖeka ko.
This is true, to some extent.	Esia nye nyateƒe, vaseɖe afi aɖe.
In fact, he was not angry with her.	Le nyateƒe me la, medo dziku ɖe eŋu o.
I am not a dog, or	Menye avu, alo .
It didn’t work either.	Mewɔ dɔ hã o.
And we can talk.	Eye míate ŋu aƒo nu.
Stay in the room.	Nɔ xɔa me.
I had to find them all.	Ele nam be madi wo katã.
Speak with reason.	Ƒo nu kple susu.
I did the same thing.	Nye hã mewɔe nenema.
Too many eyes.	Ŋku geɖe akpa.
He does this, too.	Eya hã wɔa esia.
But it was too soon for that.	Gake ewɔ kaba akpa na ema.
And, it matters for another reason.	Eye, ele vevie le susu bubu aɖe ta.
In the past, things used to be very different.	Tsã la, nuwo to vovo kura tsã.
There is something here.	Nane le afisia.
Often, over and over again.	Zi geɖe la, zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
If anything, it’s the opposite.	Ne nane li la, ke nusi to vovo na emae.
And the police will be around the clock.	Eye kpovitɔwo anɔ anyi gaƒoƒo bliboa katã.
That’s not a problem.	Ema menye kuxi aɖeke o.
He didn’t file that.	Metsɔ nya ma de agbalẽ me o.
Here is another strategy.	Aɖaŋu bubu aɖee nye esi.
It happened about a week ago.	Edzɔ abe kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia ene.
I have nothing against them.	Naneke mele asinye ɖe wo ŋu o.
He is like a child.	Ele abe ɖevi ene.
A new car.	Ʋu yeye aɖe.
I hope you know that in some way.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ènya ema le mɔ aɖe nu.
This helped me a lot.	Esia kpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ.
You can do this in advance.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia do ŋgɔ.
Also take your time.	Di wò ɣeyiɣi hã.
That’s all good.	Ema katã nyo.
But enough of what he did to me.	Gake nusi wòwɔ nam la sɔ gbɔ.
I remembered his name.	Meɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi.
That was very frustrating.	Ema te ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
There is only one thing.	Nu ɖeka koe nye be.
But they were going to say that anyway.	Gake wole nya ma gblɔ ge le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
And make it quick.	Eye na wòawɔ kaba.
Or anyone else.	Alo ame bubu ɖesiaɖe.
It doesn’t matter to me.	Menye ɖe wòle vevie nam o.
There’s some good stuff there.	Nu nyui aɖewo le afima.
You may or may not.	Àte ŋu awɔe alo màte ŋui o.
I wanted something more.	Medi nane si sɔ gbɔ wu.
It was everything to him.	Enye nusianu nɛ.
I want to.	Medi be.
It was replaced by anger and rage.	Dziku kple dziku va xɔ ɖe eteƒe.
Life is moving forward for these people.	Agbe le ŋgɔ yim na ame siawo.
In fact, I planned to stay single.	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔ ɖoɖo be manɔ tre.
No one heard them.	Ame aɖeke mese wo o.
That sounds too simple.	Ema ɖi nu bɔbɔe akpa.
But there was nothing there .	Gake naneke menɔ afima o .
I didn’t have much time to see anything else.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke menɔ asinye be makpɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
I have never seen anything like this in my life.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene le nye agbe me kpɔ o.
There will be no water element between them.	Tsi ƒe akpa aɖeke manɔ wo dome o.
I felt terrible for him.	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ɖe eŋu.
It was going to take some time.	Ele ɣeyiɣi aɖe xɔ ge hafi.
At least now, at this time of day.	Fifia ya teti, le ŋdɔ me ɣeyiɣi sia me.
Let me tell you something about myself.	Mina magblɔ nya aɖe na mi tso ɖokuinye ŋu.
Impossible.	Mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Nice to meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam be medo go wò.
Those who don’t, never will.	Ame siwo mewɔa esia o la, mawɔe gbeɖe o.
That might really surprise everyone out there.	Ema ate ŋu awɔ nuku na amesiame le afima ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And he couldn’t lie.	Eye mete ŋu da alakpa o.
If not for a long time.	Ne menye ɣeyiɣi didi o la.
He must have a car obviously.	Ele be ʋu nanɔ esi edze ƒã.
We can set up a trap for them.	Míate ŋu aɖo mɔ̃ aɖe na wo.
Not so much as it is.	Menye nenema gbegbe o.
Do what you want.	Wɔ nu si nèdi.
That’s something.	Ema nye nane.
He did not survive with us.	Metsi agbe kpli mí o.
But you can’t do it.	Gake màte ŋui o.
Think of my gun.	Bu nye tu ŋu kpɔ.
As if he was waiting.	Abe ɖe wònɔ lalam ene.
I want us to have a good plan.	Medi be ɖoɖo nyui aɖe nanɔ mía si.
It is very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ.
Look at them a little differently.	Kpɔ wo ɖa le mɔ bubu nu vie.
He did the opposite.	Ewɔ nusi to vovo na ema.
There was so much to do.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi woawɔ.
However in this case.	Ke hã le go sia me la.
Maybe he will do that.	Ðewohĩ awɔe nenema.
Two years ago.	Ƒe eve enye sia.
His mind also returned.	Eƒe susu hã trɔ gbɔ.
I'm really going to be on his good side because of this.	Mava nɔ eƒe akpa nyui la dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ le esia ta.
I hope they are working on whatever that is.	Mekpɔ mɔ be wole dɔ wɔm tso nusianu si nye ema ŋu.
Wear warm clothes.	Do awu siwo me dzo le.
There was an opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe nɔ anyi.
But we have to do this.	Gake ele be míawɔ esia.
We can always do that.	Míate ŋu awɔ ema ɣesiaɣi.
This is an impossible scenario.	Esia nye nɔnɔme si mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Some people are against it.	Ame aɖewo tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
It is a difficult situation.	Enye nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe.
Maybe in the past hour.	Ðewohĩ le gaƒoƒo si va yi me.
I have to let you go.	Ele be maɖe asi le ŋuwò.
In the market, prices remain stable.	Le asi me la, nuwo ƒe asi gakpɔtɔ li ke.
I will surprise you.	Mawɔ nuku na wò ŋutɔ.
I can’t do it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe o.
And everything seemed strange to me.	Eye nusianu dze nam be ewɔ nuku nam.
I am enjoying it.	Mele dzidzɔ kpɔm ɖe eŋu.
You can overcome this, you can live a normal, happy life.	Àte ŋu aɖu esia dzi, àte ŋu anɔ agbe si sɔ, si me dzidzɔ le.
Mine wouldn’t be like that.	Nye tɔ manɔ nenema o.

Life is good!.	Agbe nyo!.
I am fine myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mele nyuie.
We are more advanced now.	Míele ŋgɔ yim wu fifia.
Maybe because it didn’t bother him.	Ðewohĩ esi meɖe fu nɛ o tae.
I was one of the last people out.	Nyee nye ame mamlɛtɔ siwo do go la dometɔ ɖeka.
We are one.	Míenye ɖeka.
I still don’t understand what happened.	Nyemese nusi dzɔ la gɔme haɖe o.
They have great attitude.	Nɔnɔme gã aɖe le wo si.
I still have to work.	Ele kokoko be mawɔ dɔ.
It’s just getting started.	Ðeko wòle egɔme dzem.
I can’t bear it.	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi o.
Behind him the whole school gathered.	Le megbe nɛ la, suku bliboa ƒo ƒu.
But nothing is ever that simple.	Gake naneke mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe gbeɖe o.
He didn’t have much of his own.	Nu geɖe menɔ eya ŋutɔ si o.
There is no problem.	Kuxi aɖeke meli o.
You know that well.	Ènya nya ma nyuie.
Actually, not one.	Le nyateƒe me la, menye ɖeke o.
I know, but	Menya, gake .
Water is essential to life.	Tsi le vevie na agbe.
I hurried with it too, for the opposite reason.	Mewɔ kaba kplii hã, le susu si to vovo na ema ta.
I was actually very worried.	Le nyateƒe me la, metsi dzi vevie.
What he was seeing was unreal.	Nusi kpɔm wònɔ la menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Be grateful for your work, or someone else will.	Da akpe ɖe wò dɔa ŋu, ne menye nenema o la, ame bubu aɖe awɔe.
This will be done tomorrow.	Woawɔ esia etsɔ.
It’s not easy.	Mele bɔbɔe o.

I'll just go ahead and keep this up.	Ðeko mayi ŋgɔ eye mayi esia dzi.
I have a couple of new ones.	Yeye eve aɖewo le asinye.
This led to the exact same issue.	Esia na nya ma ke tututu do mo ɖa.
I would rather stay home than go.	Anyo nam wu be manɔ aƒeme tsɔ wu be mayi.
Something more personal.	Nane si nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ wu.
You can’t do things.	Màte ŋu awɔ nuwo o.
That must have been a big deal.	Ema anya nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But there really was no time for that.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi na ema o.
I don’t know where he is.	Nyemenya afi si wòle o.
And to some extent it did.	Eye vaseɖe afi aɖe la, edzɔ nenema.
People get to know who you are.	Amewo va nya amesi nènye.
Work on the foods at home.	Wɔ dɔ tso nuɖuɖu siwo le aƒeme ŋu.

Why are there so many words for hair?	Nukatae nya geɖe li na ɖa?
Nothing came up.	Naneke meva do ɖe dzi o.
Very obvious actually.	Edze ƒã ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I did this a long time ago.	Mewɔ esia ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
Space demands something new, time absorbs itself.	Teƒe bia nu yeye aɖe, ɣeyiɣi xɔa eɖokui.
If only it were that simple.	Ne ɖe wòle bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe hafi.
In the la me.	Le la me.
Someone is coming this way.	Ame aɖe le mɔ sia dzi gbɔna.
Almost everyone got on board early.	Amesiame kloe ɖo ʋua kaba.
He landed in a wet spot.	Edze anyi ɖe teƒe aɖe si tsi le.
That makes at least some sense.	Susu le ema me vie ya teti.
Any life, really.	Agbe ɖesiaɖe, le nyateƒe me.
My car is hot.	Nye ʋu xɔ dzo.
Who is against this.	Amekae tsi tre ɖe esia ŋu.
He is also going to school.	Ele suku hã yim.
He had plenty of food in that section.	Nuɖuɖu geɖe nɔ esi le akpa ma.
Nothing really, nothing helpful.	Naneke meli ŋutɔŋutɔ o, naneke meli si akpe ɖe ame ŋu o.
This really hit home for me today.	Esia ƒo ɖe aƒe nam ŋutɔ egbea.
Yesterday was a surprise.	Etsɔ nye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It’s not exciting enough.	Menye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ale gbegbe o.
Other than that, nothing really exists.	Ne menye nenema o la, naneke meli ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I think it is, a little bit.	Mesusu be ele nenema, vie.
A man should have a beard and a mustache.	Ele be ɖa kple ɖa nanɔ ŋutsu si.
That’s really good though.	Ema nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ ya.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.

Some applications require this type of planning.	Dɔ aɖewo wɔwɔ bia be woawɔ ɖoɖo sia ƒomevi.
That’s over now.	Ema wu enu fifia.

But nothing for himself.	Gake naneke meli na eɖokui o.

Maybe you can talk to him.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu aƒo nu kplii.

It’s amazing, actually.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
There really aren’t many good jobs.	Dɔ nyui geɖe meli ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He has a lot of interests.	Nu geɖe dzɔa dzi nɛ.

Not so much as it is.	Menye nenema gbegbe o.
Lightly squeeze some stuff down your throat.	Tsɔ nu aɖewo ƒo ɖe kɔ me bɔbɔe.
Over and over again.	Zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
There was no one in the room.	Ame aɖeke menɔ xɔa me o.
The job often required me to work at night.	Zi geɖe la, dɔa bia be mawɔ dɔ le zã me.
Everyone was stunned.	Amesiame ƒe nu ku.
This seems original.	Esia dze abe gbãtɔ ene.
That’s one aspect.	Ema nye akpa ɖeka.
He too is very happy.	Eya hã kpɔa dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
That made me do two things.	Ema na mewɔ nu eve wɔwɔ.
All new stainless steel appliances.	Mɔ̃ yeye siwo katã mexɔ dzo o.
This cannot be the case.	Esia mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I couldn’t get inside.	Nyemete ŋu ge ɖe eme o.
Not difficult again.	Menye sesẽ ake o.
Like you don’t want to be here.	Abe alesi mèdi be yeanɔ afisia o ene.
Let’s create an opportunity.	Mina míawɔ mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe.
Everyone in this household has to work.	Ele be aƒe sia me tɔ ɖesiaɖe nawɔ dɔ.
I think that’s a bad thing.	Mesusu be nu gbegblẽ aɖee nye ema.
I’ve been here before, in my first week, and I didn’t see anything.	Meva afisia do ŋgɔ, le nye kwasiɖa gbãtɔ me, eye nyemekpɔ naneke o.
The bullet went off.	Tu la ƒo ɖe edzi.
I didn’t want to bother him.	Nyemedi be maɖe fu nɛ o.
I’m not quite sure.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi tututu o.
There is no place.	Teƒe aɖeke meli o.
Let go of it.	Ðe asi le eŋu.
I don't understand.	Nyemese egɔme o.
You and I, it can still happen.	Mía kple wò, ate ŋu adzɔ kokoko.
That would have been a good thing.	Ema anye nu nyui aɖe hafi.
Everyone can feel it.	Amesiame ate ŋu ase le eɖokui me.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
Let him have his place.	Na eƒe teƒe nanɔ esi.
I don’t know about that.	Nyemenya nu tso nya ma ŋu o.
Exactly the same.	Nenema ke tututu.
Everything will be fine now.	Nusianu anyo azɔ.
There might be some kind of opportunity there.	Ðewohĩ mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe ƒomevi anɔ afima.
In fact, this is not the case.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia mele nenema o.
Way more interesting.	Mɔ si doa dzidzɔ na ame wu.
I was completely nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe kura.
But come on inside.	Gake va ge ɖe eme.
You can’t combine two.	Màte ŋu aƒo eve nu ƒu o.
In his frozen eyes.	Le eƒe ŋku siwo xɔ dzo me.
Just one night.	Zã ɖeka ko.
Everything has changed.	Nusianu trɔ.
Not that at all.	Menye ema kura o.
Here is an idea.	Susu aɖee nye esi.
None of them can act on their own.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ nu le eɖokui si o.
This is only part of the truth.	Nyateƒea ƒe akpa aɖe koe nye esia.
Today, it is the opposite.	Egbea la, esia to vovo na ema.
None of them are great right now.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele gã fifia o.
Many men have gone through it.	Ŋutsu geɖe to eme.
There is a problem.	Kuxi aɖe li.
If only it were like this for all of us.	Ne ɖe wòle alea na mí katã ko hafi.
Play some songs.	Ƒo ha aɖewo.
Or he didn’t believe it.	Alo mexɔ edzi se o.
I do my own thing.	Nye ŋutɔ mewɔa nye dɔ.
In fact, look at this.	Le nyateƒe me la, kpɔ esia ɖa.
Stay as long as you want.	Nɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi si nèdi.
I am the life.	Nyee nye agbe.
People will listen to me.	Amewo aɖo tom.
I don’t know who’s from.	Nyemenya amesi tso o.
Leave us alone!	Gblẽ mí ɖi!
I glanced at him.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe eŋu.
Not that big of a car either.	Menye ʋu gã nenema gbegbe hã o.
No one seemed to care.	Edze abe ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme o ene.
There is no tribe this way.	To aɖeke mele mɔ sia nu o.
You're here until four.	Èle afisia vaseɖe ene.
However, it can happen.	Ke hã, ate ŋu adzɔ.
I don’t want to go.	Nyemedi be mayi o.
I didn’t know that either.	Nye hã nyemenya ema o.
Not much else.	Menye nu bubu geɖe o.
Now comes a big surprise.	Fifia nu gã aɖe si wɔ nuku na ame la va.
I don't know enough about it to have one.	Nyemenya nu tso eŋu nyuie ale gbegbe be ɖeka nanɔ asinye o.
I know that’s you.	Menya be wòe nye ema.
That’s what’s so difficult.	Emae nye nusi sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Think of it as a lot.	Bu eŋu be nu geɖe le eme.
I have a job now.	Dɔ le asinye fifia.
The same is true here.	Nenema ke wòle le afisia hã.
More than one foot.	Afɔ siwo wu ɖeka.
I will take you away.	Maɖe wò ɖa.
It was obvious from his face that something was wrong.	Edze ƒã le eƒe mo be nane gblẽ.
I have no idea what that would be.	Nyemenya nusi ema anye o.
I'm here now.	Meva afisia fifia.
His career continued to flourish there.	Eƒe dɔa yi edzi nɔ ŋgɔ yim le afima.
So far everything works fine.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nusianu wɔa dɔ nyuie.
Which do you like best?.	Kae dzɔa dzi na wò wu?.
It’s a tiny little thing.	Enye nu sue aɖe si le sue ŋutɔ.
He was a real man, a real man.	Enye ŋutsu ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutsu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Nothing was sick of him.	Naneke medze dɔ le eŋu o.
I'll explain that.	Maɖe eme na ema.
For months, this seemed highly unlikely.	Ɣleti geɖe la, edze abe esia mate ŋu adzɔ kura o ene.
It’s not doing anything for us.	Mele naneke wɔm na mí o.
But only you can do it.	Gake wò ɖeka koe ate ŋu awɔe.
Not if you don’t want to.	Menye ne mèdi o.
It is ‘spontaneously so’.	Enye ‘le eɖokui si nenema’.
At home, too.	Le aƒeme hã.
But there is still much to do.	Gake nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.
This is very difficult.	Esia sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Almost the same, anyway.	Nenema ke kloe, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
His voice was loud.	Eƒe gbe sesẽ.
He can never really talk to her though.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu kplii ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o ke hã.
What could be this problem.	Nukae ate ŋu anye kuxi sia.
What a great meal it was.	Nuɖuɖu gã kae nye si wònye.
Not for their child.	Menye na wo vi o.
A place that seemed smaller than it was.	Teƒe si dze abe ɖe wòle sue wu alesi wònɔ ene.
Today, it’s very little.	Egbea la, nu sue aɖe koe wònye ŋutɔ.
That’s a tough one.	Ema nye nya sesẽ aɖe.
But he couldn’t do it.	Gake mete ŋu wɔe o.
Stay too long now.	Nɔ anyi didi akpa fifia.
That was me, actually.	Nyee nye ema, le nyateƒe me.
Some of them are difficult.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo sesẽ.
But this time he didn't really mind.	Gake fifia ya meɖe fu nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
It was so quick.	Ewɔ kaba ale gbegbe.
We are doing something great.	Míele nu gã aɖe wɔm.
This statement does not stand well.	Nya sia metsi tre nyuie o.
But he wasn’t there.	Gake menɔ afima o.
Issues that are difficult to reach.	Nya siwo gbɔ ɖoɖo sesẽ.
Think about your job.	Bu wò dɔa ŋu.
I don’t feel ready to deal with it quite yet.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be mele klalo be mawɔ nu kplii tututu haɖe o.
I worked very hard.	Mewɔ dɔ sesĩe ŋutɔ.
This actually works.	Esia wɔa dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I gave him money.	Metsɔ ga nɛ.
The room was very warm.	Xɔa me xɔ dzo ŋutɔ.
He can find a place here.	Ate ŋu akpɔ teƒe le afisia.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Naneke meli o, naneke meli o, naneke meli o.
I had never heard of him.	Nyemese eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
Or if you don't live in this city, another one like this.	Alo ne mèle du sia me o la, ke bubu aɖe hã anɔ abe esia ene.
It’s the first week of a new month.	Enye ɣleti yeye aɖe ƒe kwasiɖa gbãtɔ.
Would appreciate some help, thanks.	Adzɔ dzi na kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo, akpe.
But he couldn’t, not yet.	Gake mete ŋui o, menye haɖe o.
Increase this.	Do esia ɖe edzi.
The novelty was unsettling.	Nu yeye si dzɔ la meɖe dzi ɖi o.
I don’t want to live like that.	Nyemedi be manɔ agbe nenema o.
And you definitely had something in mind.	Eye nane nɔ susu me na wò godoo.
Nothing has ever worked.	Naneke mewɔ dɔ kpɔ o.
I have to get closer to them.	Ele be mate ɖe wo ŋu.
But this is more than great.	Gake esia de ŋgɔ wu nu gã aɖe ko.
Your face is kind of important.	Wò mo le vevie ƒomevi aɖe.
I guess it never happened.	Mesusu be meva eme kpɔ o.
We’re going to do something good.	Míele nu nyui aɖe wɔ ge.
About the project.	Le dɔa ŋu.
Maybe he didn’t.	Ðewohĩ mewɔe nenema o.
I’m not there right now.	Nyemele afima fifia o.
This feature works well.	Akpa sia wɔa dɔ nyuie.
But if it doesn’t.	Gake ne mewɔe nenema o la.
I work from the imagination.	Mewɔa dɔ tso susu me.
In the summer.	Le dzomeŋɔli.
But that part is clear.	Gake akpa ma me kɔ.
I don’t know who you are.	Nyemenya amesi nènye o.
Come home early.	Va aƒeme kaba.
But it’s amazing.	Gake ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It’s just really, it’s two great people.	Ðeko wòle ŋutɔŋutɔ, enye ame gã eve.
Now, that’s a little clearer.	Fifia, nya ma me kɔ vie.
It seems so simple.	Edze abe ɖe wòle bɔbɔe ŋutɔ ene.
Everyone knows about them.	Amesiame nya nu tso wo ŋu.
These guys had them.	Wo nɔ ŋutsu siawo si.
She lives alone in a small house.	Eya ɖeka koe le aƒe sue aɖe me.
Which is so weird.	Nukae nye nusi wɔ nuku alea gbegbe.
Things are easier now.	Nuwo le bɔbɔe wu fifia.
I don’t know what will happen tomorrow.	Nyemenya nu si ava dzɔ etsɔ o.
But this, this is different.	Gake esia, esia to vovo.
We didn’t like that.	Ema medze mía ŋu o.
I have a good idea.	Nye susu me nu nyui aɖe li.
This is for you.	Esia nye na wò.
That’s the whole thing.	Emae nye nu bliboa.
This goes a long way, trust me.	Esia wɔa dɔ geɖe, ka ɖe dzinye.
I was pleasantly surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nam kple dzidzɔ.
Or at least it used to be.	Alo nenema ya teti tsã.
We each took one each.	Mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe tsɔ ɖeka yi na mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
They are all busy.	Vovo mele wo katã ŋu o.
And it won’t be there.	Eye manɔ anyi o.
And that’s something that last year we didn’t have.	Eye ema nye nane si le ƒe si va yi me la, menɔ mía si o.
But something was missing.	Gake nane bu.
There was a lot going on, before him.	Nu geɖe nɔ edzi yim, do ŋgɔ nɛ.
I could be anywhere.	Mate ŋu anɔ afi sia afi.
Everything is exciting.	Nusianu doa dzidzɔ na ame.
We can’t live together.	Míate ŋu anɔ agbe ɖekae o.
I will be waiting for you.	Manɔ lalam na wò.
Or not much at this point.	Alo menye nu geɖe le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
There were few problems, none too serious.	Kuxi ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ anyi, wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ vevie ŋutɔ o.
The present work is something else.	Dɔ si li fifia nye nu bubu.
That can be a problem.	Ema ate ŋu anye kuxi.
There is more to come anyway.	Nu geɖe li siwo ava to mɔ sia mɔ nu.
You told me that before.	Ègblɔ nya ma nam do ŋgɔ.
It is a room with many rooms.	Enye xɔ si me xɔ geɖe le.
However, this will not be the case.	Ke hã, esia manɔ nenema o.
He was a dog.	Avu aɖee wònye.
He did a great job.	Ewɔ dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But, there is a downside to this.	Gake, nu gbegblẽ aɖe le esia ŋu.
, as and when required.	, ne ehiã kple ne ehiã.
That is quite different.	Ema to vovo kura.
Just to try a little bit.	Be mate kpɔ vie ko.
There must be more to this.	Ele be nu geɖe nanɔ esia ŋu.
It’s playing someone else’s part.	Enye ame bubu ƒe akpa aɖe wɔwɔ.
He was satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme.
But he couldn’t find his way.	Gake mete ŋu kpɔ eƒe mɔ o.
It didn’t exist before that.	Menɔ anyi do ŋgɔ na ema o.
I already tested a car.	Medo ʋu aɖe kpɔ xoxo.
But everything is not that simple.	Gake nusianu mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
Yet perhaps we shouldn’t have been so surprised.	Ke hã ɖewohĩ mele be wòawɔ nuku na mí nenema gbegbe hafi o.
Let me know if you like them.	Na manya ne wo dzɔa dzi na wò.
Which of these problems is more important?	Kuxi siawo dometɔ kae le vevie wu?
A lot can happen tonight.	Nu geɖe ate ŋu adzɔ le zã sia me.
I just wanted to say thank you so much.	Ðeko medi be magblɔ akpe geɖe ŋutɔ.
It is a difficult task.	Enye dɔ sesẽ aɖe.
This is a mistake.	Esia nye vodada.
Now you can do it.	Fifia àte ŋui.
He seemed surprised by this.	Edze abe esia wɔ nuku nɛ ene.
This is not the first project.	Esia menye dɔ gbãtɔ o.
It will give me time.	Ana ɣeyiɣi nam.
He wasn’t worried.	Metsi dzi o.
You hope something goes away.	Èle mɔ kpɔm be nane nu ayi.
According to the.	Le nya nu la,...
He needed to stay focused.	Ehiã be eƒe susu nanɔ nu ŋu.
But I will say this.	Gake magblɔ nya sia.
None of them are here with you.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele afisia kpli wò o.
But he couldn’t, not yet.	Gake mete ŋui o, menye haɖe o.
No one knows.	Ame aɖeke menya o.
But no one knows.	Gake ame aɖeke menya o.
It was very inconsistent.	Enye esi mewɔ ɖeka kura o.
Expect the same.	Kpɔ mɔ na nenema ke.
He is a teacher.	Enye nufiala.
But there is more here.	Gake nu geɖe wu va le afisia.
He didn’t make any mistakes.	Mewɔ vodada aɖeke o.
The reasons are many.	Susu siwo tae nye nu geɖe.
I have my sword in my hand.	Nye yi le asinye.
I have heard so much about this.	Mese nya geɖe ŋutɔ tso nya sia ŋu.
I was so angry.	Medo dziku ale gbegbe.
Once is enough.	Zi ɖeka la sɔ gbɔ.
Again, more wasted time.	Le afisia hã la, ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ geɖe wu.
If they are, great.	Ne wole nenema la, ke gã.
And there’s a dog.	Eye avu aɖe hã li.
Maybe I should do it.	Ðewohĩ ele be mawɔe.
But there is no one.	Gake ame aɖeke meli o.
I would love for you to do that.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be nàwɔ nu ma.
This is still a big deal.	Esia gakpɔtɔ nye nya gã aɖe.

One of us who didn’t care, anyway.	Mía dometɔ ɖeka si metsɔ ɖeke le eme o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I know we can count on you.	Menya be míate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe ŋuwò.
But they are not equals.	Gake menye ame siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo o.
Fix any mistakes.	Kpɔ vodada ɖesiaɖe gbɔ.
At home, at school.	Le aƒeme, le suku.
Give on it!.	Na le edzi!.
This place is good.	Teƒe sia nyo.
I don’t want to be there.	Nyemedi be manɔ afima o.
Things would stay if he could stay angry.	Nuwo anɔ anyi nenye be ate ŋu anɔ dziku me.
Or not through me.	Alo menye to nye dzi o.
Another day, another role no one asked for.	Gbe bubu la, akpa bubu aɖe si ame aɖeke mebia o.

But for now.	Gake le fifia ta.

Who allowed you to do your job.	Amekae ɖe mɔ na wò be nàwɔ wò dɔ.
It doesn’t look right.	Medze nyuie o.
Other than that, it does nothing.	Ne menye nenema o la, mewɔa naneke o.
But he had not been home for a long time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia menɔ aƒeme o.
And a lot was lost.	Eye nu geɖe bu.
And of course it worked well.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ dɔ nyuie.

I don’t know them.	Nyemenya wo o.
He has a gun in his hand.	Tu aɖe le esi.
I understand you.	Mese wò gɔme.
He couldn't figure out what it was.	Mete ŋu bu nusi wònye ŋu o.
Is a great idea.	Nye susu gã aɖe.
Find out more about them.	Kpɔ nu geɖe tso wo ŋu.
But it didn’t show me anything.	Gake menye naneke ɖem fia o.
Think about what you are doing here.	Bu nu si wɔm nèle le afisia ŋu kpɔ.
I finished with my tongue.	Metsɔ nye aɖe wu enu.
And we know you don’t have that.	Eye míenya be ema mele asiwò o.
It felt like that to me.	Ewɔ nam nenema.
I needed to focus on that.	Ehiã be nye susu nanɔ ema ŋu.
But this shouldn’t be surprising.	Gake mele be esia nawɔ nuku o.
That's too long.	Ema didi akpa.
But leave the matter to me.	Gake gblẽ nya la ɖe asinye.
My work is now complete.	Nye dɔa wu enu fifia.
Pray for him too.	Do gbe ɖa ɖe eya hã ta.
And it might not necessarily be okay.	Eye ɖewohĩ manɔ nyuie kokoko o.
But it is nowhere to be found.	Gake mele afi aɖeke o.
I was happy with my life as it was.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe nye agbe ŋu abe alesi wònɔ ene.
I couldn’t find my car.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe nye ʋua ŋu o.
It would be inexpensive.	Anye nusi mexɔ asi o.
All things are possible.	Nuwo katã ate ŋu adzɔ.
There was some money.	Ga aɖewo nɔ anyi.
I would love to do more of that.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔ nu geɖe tso ema ŋu.
But there has to be something.	Gake ele be nane nanɔ anyi.
Things are different, now.	Nuwo to vovo, fifia.
None of them could swim.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mete ŋu ƒu tsi o.
This happened to me a lot.	Esia dzɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
It was a great horse.	Sɔ gã aɖee.
Nothing else matters.	Naneke megale vevie o.
I could do it differently.	Mate ŋu awɔe le mɔ bubu nu.
Who taught you?	Amekae fia nu wò?
Nor any other man.	Alo ŋutsu bubu aɖeke hã o.
I don’t think I matter one way or another.	Nyemesusu be mele vevie le mɔ aɖe nu alo bubu nu o.
It doesn’t matter what he wants.	Nusi dim wòle la mehiã o.
It certainly is.	Ele nenema godoo.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
Actually, there was a deeper reason.	Le nyateƒe me la, susu aɖe si de to wu nɔ anyi.
What is the issue again?	Nukae nye nya la ake?
Ask a lot of questions.	Bia nya geɖe.
Something is wrong.	Nane gblẽ.
I felt a little charmed here.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye nu lé dzi nam vie le afisia.
But you can’t post them under your name.	Gake màte ŋu aɖo wo ɖe wò ŋkɔ te o.
In fact, he liked it better now.	Le nyateƒe me la, eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ wu fifia.
But it isn’t like that.	Gake mele nenema o.
Or maybe for some other reason.	Alo ɖewohĩ susu bubu aɖe tae.
But, somehow, this is more than this.	Gake, le mɔ aɖe nu la, esia de ŋgɔ wu esia.
It’s just one word.	Nya ɖeka koe wònye.
Come on in, kid.	Va ge ɖe eme, ɖevi.
But he had also lost his life before.	Gake eƒe agbe hã bu do ŋgɔ.
I hope people give us a chance.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be amewo ana mɔnukpɔkpɔ mí.
For no other reason.	Susu bubu aɖeke tae o.
This is something completely different.	Esia nye nusi to vovo kura.
This stone represents one of them.	Kpe sia tsi tre ɖi na wo dometɔ ɖeka.
It will be very exciting for us.	Adzɔ dzi na mí ŋutɔ.
And you are one of them.	Eye wò hã ènye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
None of them were probably trying.	Anɔ eme be wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ agbagba dzem o.

This should not surprise us.	Mele be esia nawɔ nuku na mí o.
You are not one of us.	Menye mía dometɔ ɖekae nènye o.
Some of these laws are in effect.	Se siawo dometɔ aɖewo le dɔ wɔm.
That's me.	Nyee nye ema.
I felt like a little kid.	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ɖevi sue aɖe ene.
He did it accordingly.	Ewɔ ɖe edzi.
It was a wonderful thing.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Why, why, why.	Nukatae, nukatae, nukatae.
It’s like a city, in an interesting way.	Ele abe du aɖe ene, le mɔ si doa dzidzɔ na ame nu.
I'd better call them.	Anyo be maƒo ka na wo.
I am very happy to have done this work.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mewɔ dɔ sia.
You may think that is impossible.	Ðewohĩ èsusu be ema manya wɔ o.
But there is a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖe li.
You can tell him it’s absolutely true.	Àte ŋu agblɔ nɛ be enye nyateƒe kura.
I’ve never felt that way before.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o.
The dust flew past me.	Anyi la dzo to ŋunye.
In fact, quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo kura na emae.
It just isn’t.	Ðeko mele nenema o.
I was there, too.	Nye hã menɔ afima.
Look for that in the coming weeks and months.	Di ema le kwasiɖa kple ɣleti siwo gbɔna me.
Sit down for a while.	Nɔ anyi vie.
No one can take that away from me.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ ema le asinye o.
Time is not money.	Ɣeyiɣi menye ga o.
It doesn’t seem to be extravagant.	Edze abe menye nusi gbɔ eme o ene.
Maybe it will help you.	Ðewohĩ akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
Double shoot if anyone else does.	Do tu zi eve ne ame bubu aɖe wɔe.
A very nice person.	Ame nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can definitely understand that.	Mate ŋu ase nya ma gɔme godoo.
Or you don’t have any.	Alo ɖeke mele asiwò o.
This is not your ship.	Esia menye wò meli o.
He wouldn’t tell them anything.	Magblɔ nya aɖeke na wo o.
It really isn’t like anything else.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele abe nu bubu aɖeke ene o.
We had a little something about it.	Nane vi aɖe nɔ mía si le eŋu.
There was money for him.	Ga nɔ anyi nɛ.
That’s what really matters.	Emae nye nusi le vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.

He won’t do that.	Mawɔe nenema o.
I was looking forward to it.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie.
That's just too much for people.	Ðeko ema sɔ gbɔ akpa na amewo.
There was something else.	Nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
And up to no good.	Eye vaseɖe nu nyui aɖeke dzi o.
Everything must be in order.	Ele be nusianu nanɔ ɖoɖo nu.
Just doing your job.	Wò dɔa wɔwɔ ko.
You know what a school is like.	Ènya alesi suku aɖe le.
Its a bright day!	Eƒe ŋkeke si me kɔ nyuie!
Or, in this case, you me.	Alo, le go sia me la, wò nam.
Please, this way.	Meɖe kuku, to mɔ sia dzi.
I will work late.	Mawɔ dɔ tsi megbe.
This is obvious.	Esia dze ƒã.
This book is just some thoughts from someone I don’t know.	Agbalẽ sia nye susu aɖewo ko tso ame aɖe si menya o gbɔ.
We can get together this afternoon.	Míate ŋu awɔ ɖeka ŋdɔ sia.
But he wasn’t angry.	Gake medo dziku o.
That doesn’t work either.	Ema hã mewɔa dɔ o.
Now everyone has one.	Fifia ɖeka le amesiame si.
Or more than two.	Alo esi wu eve.
You can easily do this here.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia bɔbɔe le afisia.
Perhaps he fell.	Ðewohĩ edze anyi.
This morning was really easy.	Ŋdi sia nɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The result was amazing.	Nusi do tso eme wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Not in this room, in this house, in this life.	Menye xɔ sia me, le aƒe sia me, le agbe sia me o.
It is a name.	Enye ŋkɔ aɖe.
My mind won’t process what happened.	Nye susu mawɔ dɔ tso nusi dzɔ ŋu o.
He is now too sick to stay home.	Edze dɔ fifia akpa be wòate ŋu anɔ aƒeme.
That was just the first one.	Gbãtɔ koe nye ema.
No one will lend you any money now.	Ame aɖeke mado ga aɖeke na wò fifia o.
It worked, but not for too long.	Ewɔ dɔ, gake menye ɣeyiɣi didi akpa o.
I think he’s really cute.	Mesusu be eƒe nu lé dzi na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Good at cheap, not bad at cheap.	Nyui le asi bɔbɔe me, menye nu gbegblẽ le asi bɔbɔe me o.
I prayed for death.	Medo gbe ɖa ɖe ku ta.
That water is nothing to them.	Tsi ma menye naneke na wo o.
He wasn’t necessarily having trouble.	Menye kuxi nɔ fu ɖem nɛ kokoko o.
In the error field.	Le vodada ƒe akpa si le eme la me.
He has a big heart.	Dzi gã aɖe le esi.
I had a viable idea.	Susu aɖe nɔ asinye si ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
That makes far more sense to me.	Susu le nya ma me wu kura nam.
It’s not that he doesn’t trust himself, or me.	Menye ɖe meka ɖe eɖokui dzi o, alo le ŋunye o.
All he cares about is money.	Nusi le vevie nɛ koe nye ga.
This little thing definitely seems to be ahead of this.	Edze abe nu sue sia le ŋgɔ na esia godoo ene.
Get in or out.	Ge ɖe eme alo do go.
However, he didn’t believe them.	Ke hã, mexɔ wo dzi se o.
To join them.	Be woawɔ ɖeka kpli wo.
I don’t know if anyone has ever turned down this money.	Nyemenya ne ame aɖe gbe ga sia kpɔ o.
And here it is, too.	Eye le afisia hã.
It was real to me.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ nam.
Or see someone else entirely.	Alo kpɔ ame bubu kura.
I am someone he can count on.	Nyee nye amesi dzi wòate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖo.
I didn’t want a long time.	Nyemedi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
I told them that.	Megblɔ nya ma na wo.
Here is a way to do it.	Mɔ aɖee nye esi.
It is the closest match.	Enye nusi sɔ kple wo nɔewo si te ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu wu.
I don’t think he would.	Mesusu be mawɔe nenema o.
However, I’m not sure why it worked.	Ke hã, nyemeka ɖe nusita wòwɔ dɔ dzi o.
People will understand.	Amewo ase egɔme.
I hope so too.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nenema ke.
But they are coming up.	Gake wole ŋgɔ gbɔna.
It did the opposite job.	Ewɔ dɔ si to vovo na ema.
Take care of everyone.	Lé be na amesiame.
That was a long time.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
You are a great man.	Ŋutsu gã aɖee nènye.
A lot of things happened.	Nu geɖe dzɔ.
You are doing two jobs.	Èle dɔ eve wɔm.
Plan your meals in advance.	Wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe wò nuɖuɖu ŋu do ŋgɔ.
For a good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe tae.
That’s what’s easy for me.	Emae nye nusi le bɔbɔe nam.
I’m here to talk to you.	Meva afisia be maƒo nu kpli wò.
I will beat myself up.	Maƒo ɖokuinye.
I asked what happened to him.	Mebia nukae dzɔ ɖe edzi hã.
I am looking for that good thing.	Mele nu nyui ma dim.
You have to work on it a little bit at a time.	Ele be nàwɔ dɔ le eŋu vie le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
I can help with it.	Mate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu.
The car is very expensive.	Ʋua xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Some went on to come forward.	Ame aɖewo yi ŋgɔ va do ɖe ŋgɔ.
I was just exhausted.	Ðeko ɖeɖi te ŋunye.
It won’t bother me.	Maɖe fu nam o.
There are many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe li.
I am very happy as we are.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ abe alesi míele ene.
A nonsensical statement, of course.	Nya si me susu mele o ya.
Click on it a little.	Zi edzi vie.
Yet no one deserved it.	Ke hã ame aɖeke medze o.
Clearly, this is true.	Edze ƒã be nya sia nye nyateƒe.
Stay back here.	Nɔ megbe le afisia.
Many things didn’t.	Nu geɖe mewɔe nenema o.
He was just a really nice guy.	Ðeko wònye ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s a good thing, from your side.	Ema nye nu nyui aɖe, tso wò akpa dzi.
He has a role to play.	Akpa aɖe le esi wòawɔ.
Why, you at home are also good.	Nukatae, wò le aƒeme hã ènye ame nyui.
The project begins next year.	Dɔa dze egɔme le ƒe si gbɔna me.
I felt like a new man.	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ŋutsu yeye ene.
Do what you want!	Wɔ nu si nèdi!
He will find a way.	Akpɔ mɔ aɖe.
Water is necessary for life.	Tsi hiã hafi agbe nanɔ anyi.
I gave birth to you.	Nyee dzi wò.
These two words are similar.	Nya eve siawo ɖi wo nɔewo.
He has as much right here as you do.	Nu geɖe le esi le afisia tututu abe wò ke ene.
But it isn’t like that.	Gake mele nenema o.
Hold on to them.	Lé wo me ɖe asi.
Maybe, but it’s not.	Ðewohĩ, gake menye nenema o.
I can’t say exactly.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya si tututu o.
But things are a little different now.	Gake nuwo to vovo vie fifia.
Talk! 	Ƒo nu!
Nothing came out.	Naneke medo go o.
A dog has that.	Ema le avu aɖe si.
I decided to go on a diet.	Meɖoe be mayi nuɖuɖu aɖe dzi.
Think about what that means for you.	Bu nusi ema fia na wò ŋu kpɔ.
But the work is really hard.	Gake dɔa ƒe nu sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I have no children.	Vi aɖeke meli nam o.
I'll just get out.	Ðeko mado go.
I’ve seen them before.	Mekpɔ wo kpɔ.
He couldn't hit it there all that well.	Mete ŋu ƒo ɖe eŋu le afima nyuie nenema gbegbe o.
I know more than you do.	Menya nu geɖe wu wò.
Still, it was amazing.	Ke hã, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
No need to renew.	Mehiã be woawɔ yeye o.
Write about it.	Ŋlɔ nu tso eŋu.
But this has become very difficult to do.	Gake esia wɔwɔ va sesẽ ŋutɔ.
It is a very necessary thing.	Enye nusi hiã vevie.
Life is beautiful.	Agbe nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
It looks very good.	Edze nyuie ŋutɔ.
Some never do this.	Ame aɖewo mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
Each of the days he made.	Ŋkeke siwo wòwɔ la dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe.
There are two parts there.	Akpa eve le afima.
I came closer to him.	Meva te ɖe eŋu.
But there is no one here.	Gake ame aɖeke mele afisia o.
Which is true in a way.	Nusi nye nyateƒe le mɔ aɖe nu.
But one thing seems likely.	Gake edze abe nu ɖeka aɖe ate ŋu adzɔ ene.
It’s not like it’s part of me.	Menye abe nye akpa aɖee wònye ene o.
No one could remember when the meeting took place.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu ɖo ŋku ɣeyiɣi si me kpekpea yi edzi la dzi o.
It is a name, of course.	Enye ŋkɔ aɖe ya.
But two things are clear.	Gake nu eve aɖewo me kɔ nyuie.
There are also a few one-room apartments.	Xɔ ɖeka me xɔ ʋɛ aɖewo hã le eme.
But that’s a big if.	Gake ema nye ne gã aɖe.
That can do it.	Ema ate ŋu awɔe.
It’s just a thought.	Susu aɖe koe.
Only he can solve this problem.	Eya koe ate ŋu akpɔ kuxi sia gbɔ.
And only when things are going well.	Eye ne nuwo le edzi yim ko hafi.
It’s an impossibility.	Enye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I have to get rid of you somehow.	Ele be maɖe wò ɖa le mɔ aɖe nu.
You just have to say nothing about it.	Ðeko wòle be nàgblɔ nya aɖeke tso eŋu o.
The good guy.	Ŋutsu nyui la.
You never wanted anything else.	Mèdi nu bubu aɖeke kpɔ o.
Only one person did this.	Ame ɖeka koe wɔ esia.
Everyone is like that in that moment.	Amesiame le nenema le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
That’s one thing with money.	Ema nye nu ɖeka le ga ŋu.
But the situation here is more complicated.	Gake nɔnɔme si le afisia ya sesẽ wu.
I'm sure you missed something.	Meka ɖe edzi be nane to ŋuwò.
Anything is always possible.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ ɣesiaɣi.
And he is not a materialist at all.	Eye menye amesi si nu le kura o.
It was a great pleasure to know you.	Enye dzidzɔ gã aɖe nam be menya wò.
Eventually, he gained respect in school.	Mlɔeba la, bubu va nɔ eŋu le suku.
He didn’t remember it.	Meɖo ŋku edzi o.
There is no time to do anything about it.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli woawɔ naneke tso eŋu o.
Ask if you can meet a few of these people.	Bia nenye be àte ŋu ado go ame siawo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo.
It wasn’t too hard, and it wasn’t too easy.	Menye nu sesẽ akpa o, eye menɔ bɔbɔe akpa hã o.
These guys found me on the way here.	Ŋutsu siawo ke ɖe ŋunye le mɔ dzi gbɔna afisia.
There wasn’t any of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I felt sick.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be medze dɔ.
It should not be processed.	Mele be woawɔ dɔ le eŋu o.
And it’s not one.	Eye menye ɖeka o.
Many people have done that.	Ame geɖe wɔ nu ma.
Now he doesn’t care.	Fifia metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
Just in case someone has the same issue.	Nenye be nya ma ke le ame aɖe ŋu ko.
I can handle that.	Mate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ.
It may be because it’s your last chance.	Ate ŋu anye esi wònye wò mɔnukpɔkpɔ mamlɛtɔ tae.
Clearly, this raises a problem.	Edze ƒã be esia fɔ kuxi aɖe ɖe te.
There was no time to react.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu o.
I entered the house alone.	Nye ɖeka koe ge ɖe aƒea me.
I just needed some more time.	Ðeko mehiã ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖe.
I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.	Edzɔ dzi nam be èle dzidzɔ kpɔm.
He just didn’t care.	Ðeko metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
From there, it’s.	Tso afima.
Run away.	Si dzo.
That’s your path.	Emae nye wò mɔ.
But this is not easy at all.	Gake esia mele bɔbɔe kura o.
Take a break once every two hours.	Gbɔ ɖe eme zi ɖeka le gaƒoƒo eve ɖesiaɖe me.
I have known a man similar to this.	Menya ŋutsu aɖe si sɔ kple esia kpɔ.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I didn’t understand what was going on.	Nyemese nu si nɔ edzi yim la gɔme o.
I know what you are doing.	Menya nu si wɔm nèle.
Everyone rushed to do so.	Amesiame ƒu du va wɔe nenema.
We need to keep this in mind.	Ele be nya sia nanɔ susu me na mí.
He didn’t know what he was in for.	Menya nusi me wòle o.
I don’t see any mistakes.	Nyemekpɔ vodada aɖeke o.
But some of them are very very expensive.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖewo xɔ asi ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
Yet he wasn’t sure.	Ke hã meka ɖe edzi o.
I don’t know this guy.	Nyemenya ŋutsu sia o.
Everyone is happy.	Dzi dzɔa ame sia ame.
I think he might never have been there.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ menɔ afima kpɔ o.
But right behind you comes his teacher.	Gake le wò megbe teti la, eƒe nufiala va.
It was just him.	Ðeko wònye eya ŋutɔ.
What is...	Nukae nye...
Much better now.	Anyo wu fifia ŋutɔ.
Maybe nothing should be done at this point.	Ðewohĩ mele be woawɔ naneke le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
But there was so much joy in his life.	Gake dzidzɔ geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ eƒe agbe me.
Again, it surprised me to my core.	Azɔ hã, ewɔ nuku nam vaseɖe nye dzi me.
There was something else going on here.	Nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ edzi yim le afisia.
You have to do the same thing over and over again.	Ele be nàwɔ nu ɖeka ma ke zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I tell you something though.	Megblɔ nya aɖe na mi ke hã.
That started right there.	Emae dze egɔme le afima tututu.
I have been in it for a long time.	Mele eme ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
The sword will kill.	Yi la awu ame.
This is not who he is.	Menye amesi wònye ye nye esia o.
It wasn’t like that.	Menɔ nenema o.
One wonders why he never made another.	Ame aɖe bia eɖokui be nukatae mewɔ bubu kpɔ o hã.
And it isn’t either.	Eye menye nenema hã o.
The cat likes the cat.	Avu la dzɔa dzi na avu la.
Maybe a little earlier.	Ðewohĩ do ŋgɔ vie.
I can do this.	Mate ŋu awɔ esia.
It was one of the first results.	Enye nu gbãtɔ siwo do tso eme la dometɔ ɖeka.
It doesn’t matter.	Mehiã o.
I really want this.	Medi esia ŋutɔ.
I got the job.	Mexɔ dɔa.
This works very well.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
Yet he said nothing.	Ke hã megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Everything was in place.	Nusianu nɔ teƒe si wòle.
He is going backwards.	Ele megbe yim.
This actually happened .	Esia dzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ .
But it did start.	Gake edze egɔme nyateƒe.
No one came along.	Ame aɖeke meva o.
Death is death.	Ku nye ku.
He couldn’t balance properly.	Mete ŋu da sɔ nyuie o.
Many people are not.	Ame geɖe mele nenema o.
Maybe he had it too.	Ðewohĩ eya hã nɔ esi.
First, last and everything in between.	Gbãtɔ, mamlɛtɔ kple nusianu si le wo dome.
A timeless city.	Du si mele ɣeyiɣi aɖeke me o.
And so was he, too.	Eye eya hã nɔ nenema.
This didn’t take long at all.	Esia mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke kura o.
There was nowhere he could go.	Afi aɖeke menɔ anyi si wòate ŋu ayi o.
I was just too upset about what happened.	Ðeko nusi dzɔ la te ɖe dzinye akpa.
No problems so far.	Kuxi aɖeke meli vaseɖe fifia o.
He had to try one last time.	Ele nɛ be wòate kpɔ zi mamlɛtɔ.
You know there is no other way.	Ènya be mɔ bubu aɖeke meli o.
And let me just tell you something.	Eye na magblɔ nya aɖe na wò ko.
His life was ahead of him.	Eƒe agbe nɔ ŋgɔ nɛ.
But you did the opposite.	Gake nusi to vovo na emae nèwɔ.
A real home from home.	Aƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ si tso aƒeme.
This will be my reality next year.	Esia anye nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ le ƒe si gbɔna me.
You are more than that.	Wòe nye nusi wu ema.
I just believed in me.	Ðeko mexɔ dzinye se.
It doesn’t matter at all.	Mehiã kura o.
I never saw a face.	Nyemekpɔ mo kpɔ o.
Night is coming, now.	Zã gbɔna, fifia.
Stay where you are.	Nɔ afisi nèle.
But that just wouldn’t make sense.	Gake susu manɔ nya ma me ko o.
He couldn’t run.	Mete ŋu ƒu du o.
It has never been like that.	Menye nenema kpɔ o.
He might have said or done something.	Ðewohĩ agblɔ nya aɖe alo awɔ nane hafi.
That’s my job.	Emae nye nye dɔ.
He didn’t refuse.	Megbe o.
This can be exciting.	Esia ate ŋu ado dzidzɔ na ame.
One more man.	Ŋutsu ɖeka bubu.
But nothing seems to work.	Gake edze abe naneke mewɔa dɔ o ene.
The meeting was exhausting.	Kpekpea te ɖeɖi ame ŋu ŋutɔ.
That’s all from us here.	Ema katã tso mía gbɔ le afisia.
Everything that was there.	Nusianu si nɔ afima.
You can’t do that.	Màte ŋu awɔe nenema o.
I didn’t see any other way.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ bubu aɖeke o.
Something has changed.	Nane trɔ.
More than you think you know.	Nu geɖe wu esi nèsusu be yenya.
Thanks a lot and often.	Akpe na amewo geɖe eye zi geɖe.
I was surprised to see you, actually.	Ewɔ nuku nam be mekpɔ wò, le nyateƒe me.
It is important to keep these points in mind.	Ele vevie be nya siawo nanɔ susu me na mí.
Its something we have to do.	Eƒe nane si wòle be míawɔ.
I need to know what’s going on here.	Ele be manya nusi le edzi yim le afisia.
I am that guy.	Nyee nye ŋutsu ma.
I want to.	Medi be.
That’s a good thing.	Nya nyui aɖee nye ema.
He can have it.	Ate ŋu anɔ esi.
But in some places it is.	Gake le teƒe aɖewo la, ele nenema.
There seemed little chance he could win.	Edze abe mɔnukpɔkpɔ boo aɖeke menɔ anyi be wòate ŋu aɖu dzi o ene.
But after that, no problem.	Gake le ema megbe la, kuxi aɖeke meli o.
I think something bad is wrong with his head.	Mesusu be nu gbegblẽ aɖe gblẽ le eƒe ta ŋu.
Let me explain better.	Mina maɖe eme nyuie wu.
I will find the right time to do so.	Makpɔ ɣeyiɣi si sɔ be mawɔe nenema.
Not so many more people.	Menye ame geɖe wu nenema o.
In more ways than one.	Le mɔ geɖe nu wu ɖeka.
That was the part he didn’t like.	Emae nye akpa si medze eŋu o.
This man's man.	Ŋutsu aɖe ƒe ame ŋutsu sia.
This is just a new reality.	Esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ yeye aɖe ko.
I couldn’t help it.	Nyemete ŋu kpe ɖe eŋu o.
But it would be a bad thing.	Gake anye nu gbegblẽ.
He didn’t apologize either.	Meɖe kuku hã o.
But things have changed so much.	Gake nuwo trɔ ale gbegbe.
I really don’t want to do anything more.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be mawɔ naneke wu esia o.
If you have a problem, we have a problem.	Ne kuxi aɖe le ŋuwò la, kuxi aɖe nɔa mía ŋu.
It cannot end there.	Mate ŋu awu enu ɖe ​​afima o.
That’s a good thing.	Nya nyui aɖee nye ema.
Not for any of them.	Menye na wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
You can make phone calls.	Àte ŋu aƒo ka na amewo.
I think everyone should too!.	Mesusu be ele be amesiame hã!.
They will make a mistake.	Woawɔ vodada.
Who knows what else is in store?.	Amekae nya nu bubu siwo le ŋgɔ gbɔna?.
I only have to be that good for one night.	Zã ɖeka koe wòle be manɔ nyuie nenema.
Express your opinion.	Gblɔ wò susu.
Often it’s not just one simple thing.	Zi geɖe la, menye nu bɔbɔe ɖeka koe wònye o.
I will be there myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mava afima.
Everyone will be happy.	Adzɔ dzi na amesiame.
Very easy to work in this.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ le esia me.
I think he is trying to impress us.	Mesusu be ele agbagba dzem be yeawɔ dɔ ɖe mía dzi.
Finding a job was difficult for him.	Dɔ didi sesẽ nɛ.
But if it is true.	Gake nenye be enye nyateƒe.
Its a good idea.	Eƒe susu nyui aɖee.
Those who are still working today.	Ame siwo gakpɔtɔ le dɔ wɔm egbea.
But I was very happy to be there.	Gake edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be menɔ afima.
We have a lot of kids like him here.	Vi geɖe le mía si abe eya ene le afisia.
He would have been very pleased with this.	Anye ne esia adzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
Not if he’s looking for something.	Menye nenye be ele nane dim o.
It’s how many new people found us.	Enye alesi ame yeye geɖe ke ɖe mía ŋui.
How am I going to do that.	Aleke mawɔ awɔ emae.
Everyone just kind of knows that.	Ðeko amesiame nya esia le mɔ aɖe nu.
Or, you know.	Alo, ènya.
He's not a very forward-thinking person.	Menye ame si ƒoa nu do ŋgɔ ŋutɔ o.
But it is often not possible.	Gake zi geɖe la, manya wɔ o.
It had worked once.	Ewɔ dɔ zi ɖeka kpɔ.
That is passive.	Ema nye nusi mewɔa naneke o.
You can have your time.	Àte ŋu akpɔ wò ɣeyiɣi.
It wouldn’t surprise me one bit.	Mawɔ nuku nam vie o.
I think it will go very well.	Mesusu be azɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
It’s like a snake.	Ele abe da ene.
There is simply nothing like it.	Ðeko naneke meli si sɔ kplii o.
Some kind of mistake happened.	Vodada aɖe ƒomevi dzɔ.
This makes sense, of course.	Susu le esia me, le nyateƒe me.
And the car, too.	Eye ʋu la hã.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
Talk about doing a great job.	Ƒo nu tso dɔ gã aɖe wɔwɔ ŋu.
Tom believed him.	Tom xɔ edzi se.
There are no rules.	Se aɖeke meli o.
We know too much about life.	Míenya nu geɖe tso agbe ŋu akpa.
He doesn’t know about it yet.	Menya nu tso eŋu haɖe o.
I struggle with it, still.	Mewɔa avu kplii, kokoko.
Someone please give me a hand.	Ame aɖe taflatse na asi nam.
Act in me.	Wɔ nu le menye.
The apartment is very nice.	Xɔa me nyo ŋutɔ.
I knew what was going to happen there.	Menya nusi ava dzɔ le afima.
Now you’re talking.	Fifia èle nu ƒom.
Keep everyone busy.	Na amesiame nanɔ dɔ dzi.
There is no death before death.	Ku aɖeke meli do ŋgɔ na ku o.
It will take us some time to do this.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe hafi míate ŋu awɔ esia.
Which he did, of course.	Nusi wòwɔ ya.
He couldn’t find one.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeka ŋu o.
I don’t know how many times.	Nyemenya zi nenie o.
That’s a good thing and a bad thing.	Ema nye nu nyui kple nu gbegblẽ.
And let me know about it.	Eye na manya nu tso eŋu.
He didn’t ask for this.	Mebia esia o.
But it’s not that simple.	Gake menye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
Think about it carefully.	Bu eŋu nyuie.
This is a first-time case.	Esia nye nya si ku ɖe ame ŋu zi gbãtɔ.
After the first time, it’s easy.	Le zi gbãtɔ megbe la, ele bɔbɔe.
Just the one you’re working on.	Amesi ŋu nèle dɔ wɔm le koe.
I'll just stay right here.	Ðeko manɔ afisia tututu.
I’m glad I knew.	Edzɔ dzi nam be menya.
There would be no space.	Anye ne teƒe manɔ anyi o.
It was an old, dilapidated building.	Enye xɔ xoxo aɖe si gblẽ.
It was a tough day for him.	Enye ŋkeke sesẽ aɖe nɛ.
Impossible.	Mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Finally, something good for him to work with.	Mlɔeba la, nu nyui aɖe si wòate ŋu awɔ dɔ kplii.
I also object to the idea that someone was there.	Metsi tre ɖe susu si nye be ame aɖe nɔ afima hã ŋu.
Just a little bit.	Vi aɖe ko.
I ended up working for them for years.	Meva nɔ dɔ wɔm na wo ƒe geɖe.
This probably has to do with the vulnerability of these teeth.	Anɔ eme be esia ku ɖe afisi aɖu siawo le bɔbɔe ŋu.
He's been here a long time.	Ele afisia ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
As in two.	Abe alesi wòle le eve me ene.
You can’t take them.	Màte ŋu axɔ wo o.
No one had ever heard of me.	Ame aɖeke mese nye ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
We know this is difficult.	Míenya be esia sesẽ.
It’s very painful.	Eve ame ŋutɔ.
The ones that asked my opinion.	Wo dometɔ siwo bia nye susu.
Usually.	Zi geɖe la.
However, my heart is in my mouth.	Ke hã, nye dzi le nye nu me.
Remove the liquid.	Ðe tsi si le eme la ɖa.
And what we have is that missing piece.	Eye nusi le mía si enye nu ma si bu.
I don’t know what you’re going to do.	Nyemenya nu si nàwɔ o.
And everything in between.	Eye nusianu si le wo dome.
That’s what you are.	Wòe nye ema.
It is a respectable job.	Enye dɔ si ŋu bubu le.
it’s really simple.	ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Which probably says something good about us.	Nusi anya gblɔ nya nyui aɖe tso mía ŋu.
Is there a right way.	Ðe mɔ aɖe li si sɔ.
And every year there was more to do.	Eye ƒe sia ƒe la, nu geɖe nɔ anyi woawɔ.
It will create a new era.	Awɔ ɣeyiɣi yeye.
Thank you for now.	Akpe na mi ɖe fifia ta.
I told him what had happened to me.	Megblɔ nu si dzɔ ɖe dzinye la nɛ.
It was the perfect place.	Enye teƒe si sɔ nyuie.
Maybe more than that.	Ðewohĩ nusi wu ema.
But it didn’t start.	Gake medze egɔme o.
Also, it needs two compatible types.	Azɔ hã, ehiã ƒomevi eve siwo sɔ.
In short, there is none.	Kpuie ko la, ɖeke meli o.
You can’t have a good time.	Màte ŋu akpɔ ɣeyiɣi nyui o.
I think the reasons for that are obvious enough.	Mesusu be susu siwo tae wòle nenema ɖo la dze ƒã ale gbegbe.
I am absolutely sure of it.	Meka ɖe edzi tututu.
Just the general idea .	Susu si le amewo katã dome ko .
This works like this.	Esia wɔa dɔ ale.
Everything else, he's doing great.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe, ele nu gã aɖe wɔm.
Priority .	Nusi le vevie .
I’m not going down that road.	Nyemele mɔ ma dzi yim o.
And you’re in a tough spot, really.	Eye èle nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe me, le nyateƒe me.
It made a lot of sense to me.	Susu geɖe nɔ eme nam.
I have a part to play in that too.	Akpa aɖe le asinye mawɔ le ema hã me.
That’s just not realistic.	Ðeko ema menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I guess that’s normal for something like this.	Mesusu be ema sɔ na nane si le abe esia ene.
And the house, too.	Eye aƒea hã.
He couldn't think about this now.	Mete ŋu bu nya sia ŋu fifia o.
It doesn’t really matter.	Mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
This is not a new issue.	Esia menye nya yeye o.
This gave him a sense of satisfaction.	Esia na dzi dze eme.
That would be wrong too.	Ema hã anye nu gbegblẽ.
But you don’t want to see that.	Gake mèdi be yeakpɔ ema o.
I am trying to find out.	Mele agbagba dzem be manya.
But this is over now.	Gake esia wu enu fifia.
I have come to respect you.	Meva de bubu ŋuwò.
I’ve been there before.	Meva ɖo afima kpɔ.
Look look here.	Kpɔ ɖa kpɔ afisia.
The whole house attacked us.	Aƒe bliboa dze mía dzi.
Only one person has ever died.	Ame ɖeka koe ku kpɔ.
As it is now.	Abe alesi wòle fifia ene.
Your head is your own common sense.	Wò tae nye wò ŋutɔ wò susu nyui.
That is so easy to believe.	Ema dzi se le bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
But this once.	Gake esia zi ɖeka.
Who knows how many.	Amekae nya ame nenie.
There were so many possibilities.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi si ate ŋu adzɔ.
I knew it was in there somewhere.	Menya be ele afima le afi aɖe.
You can take the lead.	Àte ŋu axɔ ŋgɔ.
His head was small, really small.	Eƒe ta nɔ sue, sue ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Yet we still had food.	Ke hã nuɖuɖu gakpɔtɔ nɔ mía si.
But it doesn’t matter.	Gake mehiã o.
He cannot save you and your people.	Mate ŋu axɔ wò kple wò amewo o.
It was a long shot.	Enye tu didi aɖe.
That didn’t do anything for me at all.	Ema mewɔ naneke nam kura o.
More time than we have.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu esi le mía si.
If so, it is.	Ne ele nenema la.
There is absolutely none of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke kura meli o.
Nothing looked right.	Naneke medze nyuie o.
His mouth fell off.	Eƒe nu dze anyi.
It’s a pretty big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I didn’t expect to do that.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be mawɔe nenema o.
He would never see any of them now.	Makpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke fifia gbeɖe o.
So far, this has not been possible.	Vaseɖe fifia la, esia mete ŋu dzɔ o.
No one was ready.	Ame aɖeke menɔ klalo o.
In a word, nothing.	Le nya ɖeka me la, naneke meli o.
You are one of them.	Ènye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
I don’t know that.	Nyemenya nya ma o.
Only the people who live there really know about this place.	Ame siwo le afi ma koe nya nu tso teƒe sia ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
One last shot at me.	Tu mamlɛtɔ ɖeka ɖe ŋunye.
I don't know, of course.	Nyemenya o ya.
And of course some will.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ame aɖewo awɔe nenema.
They have no reason.	Susu aɖeke mele wo ŋu o.
It was just that way.	Ðeko wònɔ nenema.
It was a long shot.	Enye tu didi aɖe.
That looks pretty good.	Ema dze nyuie ŋutɔ.
Each with its own voice.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe kple eƒe gbe.
It’s not too complicated.	Menye nusi me kɔ akpa o.
The police are becoming more and more harassing.	Kpovitɔwo va le fu ɖem na ame geɖe wu.
That was never his job.	Ema menye eƒe dɔ gbeɖe o.
It’s clever.	Edze aɖaŋu.
It’s not that weird.	Menye nusi wɔ nuku nenema gbegbe o.
I told him everything.	Megblɔ nya sia nya nɛ.
It’s just the opposite.	Enye nusi to vovo na ema tututu.
But there are a few downsides.	Gake nu gbegblẽ ʋɛ aɖewo le eŋu.
Things weren’t like that in real life.	Nuwo menɔ nenema le agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ me o.
We can go somewhere.	Míate ŋu ayi afi aɖe.
But it was a long time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee wònye.
They are too short and too short for this project.	Wole kpuie akpa eye wole kpuie akpa na dɔ sia.
But not in this house.	Gake menye le aƒe sia me o.
I am single after all.	Nyee nye tre le nyateƒe me.
There is no one there.	Ame aɖeke mele afima o.
There are many opportunities.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe li.
I hope it works out well.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ nyuie.
He would have killed me.	Anye ne awu nye hafi.
Once you’re in, you’re in tough hands.	Ne ènya ge ɖe eme ko la, èle asi sesẽ aɖe me.
This will be good for him.	Esia anyo nɛ.
He is a man of his word.	Enye ame si le eƒe nya nu.
There was very little wind tonight.	Ya sue aɖe koe ƒo le zã sia me.
A very good quality.	Nɔnɔme nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
It is my passion.	Enye nye didi vevie.
This is another lie.	Esia hã nye alakpa bubu.
Many people were very happy.	Ame geɖe kpɔ dzidzɔ gã aɖe.
I am not sure what.	Nyemeka ɖe nukae dzi o.
And there isn’t much time.	Eye ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke meli o.
In real life.	Le agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ me.
This is not a school.	Esia menye suku o.
This is enough and no longer.	Esia sɔ gbɔ eye megale nenema o.
Just the way it is.	Ale si wòle ko.
A simple mistake.	Vodada bɔbɔe aɖe.
It doesn’t seem to exist.	Edze abe meli o ene.
There should be more here.	Ele be nu geɖe wu nanɔ afisia.
He threw the gun away.	Etsɔ tu la ƒu gbe.
I was able to get through it.	Mete ŋu to eme.
Maybe he was depressed.	Ðewohĩ nu te ɖe edzi.
Sit down there.	Nɔ anyi ɖe afima.
Not at work, not at home.	Menye le dɔme o, menye le aƒeme o.
He couldn’t drive.	Mete ŋu ku ʋu o.
I don’t know where we are now.	Nyemenya afi si míele fifia o.
He would obviously get his attention.	Edze ƒã be eƒe susu ava nɔ eŋu.
It was a difficult job.	Dɔ sesẽ aɖee wònye.
We are so sorry for your loss.	Eve mí ŋutɔ ɖe wò nusi bu ta.
It probably hasn’t arrived yet.	Anɔ eme be meva ɖo haɖe o.
You can’t prove anything to anyone.	Màte ŋu aɖo kpe naneke dzi na ame aɖeke o.
A very big deal.	Nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Two for the price of one.	Eve ɖe ɖeka ƒe asi ta.
That was like yesterday to me.	Ema nɔ abe etsɔ ene nam.
I would like to make a reservation.	Madi be mawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe teƒe aɖe ŋu.
And they are, too.	Eye wole nenema hã.
Look at what he has.	Kpɔ nusi le esi ɖa.
This made me feel better.	Esia na nye dzi dze eme.
Looking forward to seeing you there!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be makpɔ wò le afima!.
There is no way.	Mɔ aɖeke meli o.
He wasn't sure what was real.	Meka ɖe nusi nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ dzi o.
It couldn't have been very important.	Mate ŋu anɔ vevie ŋutɔ hafi o.
I was just convinced he needed my help.	Ðeko meka ɖe edzi be ehiã nye kpekpeɖeŋu.
And he can score when he needs to.	Eye ate ŋu aƒo go ne ehiã.
Think about this for a moment.	Bu nya sia ŋu vie.
This will steal your heart!.	Esia afi wò dzi!.
It is a complete lie.	Enye alakpa kura.
I am the owner of the project.	Nyee nye dɔa tɔ.
I would like to tell you about them.	Madi be magblɔ wo ŋu nya na mi.
Not that night.	Menye zã ma me o.
There was a lot of good and some bad.	Nu nyui geɖe kple nu gbegblẽ aɖewo dzɔ.
I want to do it now.	Medi be mawɔe fifia.
Have a very good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nanɔ asiwò.
Let me know about it.	Na manya nu tso eŋu.
Tomorrow will be just another day for me.	Etsɔ anye ŋkeke bubu aɖe ko nam.
He was only one child.	Vi ɖeka koe wònye.
This seemed to calm him down.	Edze abe esia na eƒe dzi dze eme ene.
Someone in his head.	Ame aɖe le eƒe ta me.
You wrote them.	Wòe ŋlɔ wo.
I had to do something with it.	Ele be mawɔ nane kplii.
And he liked that very much.	Eye nya ma dzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
Face, mouth, and heart.	Mo, nu, kple dzi.
This applies to you and me as well.	Esia ku ɖe nye kple wò hã ŋu.
I can’t seem to do anything about it.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke le eŋu o ene.
I made them in a year.	Mewɔ wo le ƒe ɖeka me.
How little one knows what is inside oneself.	Aleke gbegbe ame menya nusi le eɖokui me boo o.
This can be a bad thing.	Esia ate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ.
A man like that doesn’t seem like it.	Ŋutsu si le abe ema ene la medze abe ɖe wòle nenema o ene.
Without you, it wouldn’t be possible.	Wò manɔmee la, mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Or his last name.	Alo eƒe ŋkɔ mamlɛtɔ.
I’m not going to tell you any lies.	Nyemele alakpa aɖeke gblɔ ge na wò o.
King was still here.	Fia gakpɔtɔ nɔ afisia.
It is definitely complex.	Enye nusi me kɔ godoo.
It was the perfect place for him.	Enye teƒe si sɔ nyuie nɛ.
Stir in a little sand.	Tsɔ ke vi aɖe ƒo ɖe eme.
Not there and not anywhere else.	Menye afima o eye menye teƒe bubu aɖeke hã o.
He couldn’t do it.	Mete ŋu wɔe o.
In fact, it’s amazing.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That was his anger.	Emae nye eƒe dziku.
I saw some great ones and missed some great ones.	Mekpɔ gã aɖewo eye gã aɖewo hã to ŋunye.
I didn’t hear anything else.	Nyemese nya bubu aɖeke o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This is not true, of course.	Esia menye nyateƒe ya o.
But that might be nice.	Gake ɖewohĩ ema anyo ŋutɔ.
Quite a lot, actually.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
I have been in a waiting period for the past year.	Mele lalam ƒe ɣeyiɣi aɖe me ƒe ɖeka enye sia.
He can’t stay here.	Mate ŋu anɔ afisia o.
Something happened, something happened.	Nane dzɔ, dzɔ, nane dzɔ.
He wasn’t sure.	Meka ɖe edzi o.
He doesn’t seem like the right person to me.	Edze nam abe ame si sɔ ene o.
Actually, that’s pretty good.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema nyo ŋutɔ.
Time doesn’t seem to matter at all.	Edze abe ɣeyiɣi mele vevie kura o ene.
Not too impressive.	Menye nusi wɔa dɔ ɖe ame dzi akpa o.
These thoughts made me very happy.	Susu siawo na mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
Some people won’t do that.	Ame aɖewo mawɔe nenema o.
I think he needs someone to take care of him.	Mesusu be ehiã ame aɖe si akpɔ edzi.
Write things down.	Ŋlɔ nuwo ɖi.
This worked for him.	Esia wɔ dɔ nɛ.
It will do that.	Awɔe nenema.
On the one hand.	Le go ɖeka me la.
I stayed in it.	Metsi anyi le eme.
I lent my support.	Medo nye kpekpeɖeŋu na amewo.
It might work but it shouldn’t.	Ðewohĩ awɔ dɔ gake mele be wòawɔ dɔ o.
They, they.	Va, va.
This is a difficult task.	Esia nye dɔ sesẽ aɖe.
This can be a problem.	Esia ate ŋu anye kuxi.
Another factor is your mind.	Nu bubu aɖee nye wò susu.
I have nothing against it myself.	Nye ŋutɔ nye nya aɖeke metsi tre ɖe eŋu o.
He was wrong in the most moderate way possible.	Ewɔ vodada le mɔ si sɔ gbɔ wu nu.
It’s a good job we’re here.	Enye dɔ nyui aɖe si míele afisia.
That seems to be a good point.	Edze abe nya ma nyo ene.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I’m not going to do this with you.	Nyemele esia wɔ ge kpli wò o.

That’s why these pieces are so different.	Esia tae akpa siawo to vovo kura ɖo.
There really is nothing like it.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke meli abe eya ene o.
I know exactly what happened.	Menya nusi tututu dzɔ.
It's good for me.	Anyo nam.
That should be easy.	Ele be ema nanɔ bɔbɔe.
Every day more and more people are asking for help.	Gbe sia gbe la, ame geɖe wu va le kpekpeɖeŋu biam.
I can control it better.	Mate ŋu aɖu edzi nyuie wu.
We don’t know where we are now.	Míenya afi si míele fifia o.
It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
I have a child.	Vi aɖe le asinye.
This year, I was intrigued by two things.	Le ƒe sia me la, nu eve aɖewo do dzidzɔ nam.
Apparently I did.	Edze abe mewɔe ene.
I did well in that.	Mewɔe nyuie le ema me.
Just think of it this way!	Bu eŋu alea ko!
In the mind, of course.	Le susu me ya.
After only a few weeks.	Le kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo ko megbe.
This did come back.	Esia trɔ gbɔ nyateƒe.
I have been waiting for you.	Menɔ lalam na wò kpɔ.
I'll call tomorrow.	Maƒo ka etsɔ.
He will never know what it is.	Manya nusi wònye gbeɖe o.
I don’t want to know things.	Nyemedi be manya nuwo o.
I can’t work out how much there could be.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ dɔ tso alesi gbegbe ate ŋu anɔ anyi ŋu o.
He could not continue his work.	Mete ŋu yi eƒe dɔa dzi o.
That was too much for him, he couldn't bear it.	Ema sɔ gbɔ nɛ akpa, mete ŋu do dzi o.
Go through and through.	To eme kple to eme.
No one came near him.	Ame aɖeke mete ɖe eŋu o.
It’s in me.	Ele menye.
And yet, it is.	Eye ke hã, ele nenema.
Only you can finish this.	Wò ɖeka koe ate ŋu awu esia nu.
This works very well.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
Someone who knows a lot about you people.	Ame aɖe si nya nu geɖe tso mi amewo ŋu.
There have been some good and bad things.	Nu nyui kple nu gbegblẽ aɖewo va dzɔ.
There’s really only one word for that.	Le nyateƒe me la, nya ɖeka koe li na ema.
He does not do this	Mewɔa esia o .
But the task became more difficult.	Gake dɔa va sesẽ wu.
It is much more than that.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema kura.
This time, he was more positive.	Fifia ya, susu nyui nɔ eŋu wu.
I made my own costume.	Mewɔ nye ŋutɔ nye awu.
Real life.	Agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That kind of thing.	Nu ma ƒomevi.
It’s already started.	Edze egɔme xoxo.

And the possibility of more of the same.	Eye mɔnukpɔkpɔ si li be woawɔ nu ma ke geɖe wu.

Maybe that’s why.	Ðewohĩ esia tae.
And the dog, if they had one.	Eye avu la, ne ɖe le wo si.
I am a strong person.	Nyee nye ame sesẽ.
And many of them are very good.	Eye wo dometɔ geɖe nyo ŋutɔ.

He put the car in reverse.	Etsɔ ʋua ɖo megbe.
We have something for one time and something for another.	Nane le mía si na ɣeyiɣi aɖe eye nane le mía si na ɣeyiɣi bubu.
If they were, the result would be the same.	Ne wole nenema la, anye ne nu ɖeka ma ke ado tso eme.
But we’re going to keep going.	Gake míele edzi yim.
He was a dog.	Avu aɖee wònye.
Before that, everything worked fine.	Do ŋgɔ na ema la, nusianu wɔ dɔ nyuie.
I'm for that.	Mele ema ta.
He doesn’t need any.	Mehiã ɖeke o.
He couldn’t continue.	Mete ŋu yi edzi o.
Who played that role?	Amekae wɔ akpa ma?
Can’t you talk to him yourself?	Ðe wò ŋutɔ màte ŋu aƒo nu kplii oa?
He won’t do that.	Mawɔe nenema o.
That’s a very good thing.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ.
Expect it in the next week or so.	Kpɔ mɔ nɛ le kwasiɖa si gbɔna alo esi wu nenema me.
We have the same word for both death and time.	Nya ɖeka le mía si na ku kple ɣeyiɣi siaa.

And maybe he likes that.	Eye ɖewohĩ adzɔ dzi nɛ nenema.
But he has no time for it now.	Gake ɣeyiɣi mele esi na esia fifia o.
And they don’t have it.	Eye mele wo si o.
I just couldn’t stand it.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.

So much water, so little space.	Tsi geɖe ŋutɔ, teƒe sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
That really started this path.	Emae dze mɔ sia gɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
A new voice.	Gbe yeye aɖe.
About his past.	Ku ɖe eƒe agbe si wònɔ va yi ŋu.
You can always pray.	Àte ŋu ado gbe ɖa ɣesiaɣi.
He could have stayed there for years.	Ate ŋu anɔ afima ƒe geɖe hafi.
Honestly, I can’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋui o.
Way, way too hard.	Mɔ, mɔ sesẽ akpa.

He can’t explain it.	Mate ŋu aɖe egɔme o.

There is no money in that.	Ga aɖeke mele ema me o.

Leave that to us.	Gblẽ nya ma ɖe mía si me.

That can never happen again.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ ake gbeɖe o.
People are now living longer because of better food.	Amewo le agbe didi wu fifia le nuɖuɖu si nyo wu ta.

Please hope this works for you.	Taflatse ele mɔ kpɔm be esia nye dɔ na wò.

That’s not a problem.	Ema menye kuxi o.
There is nothing in it for him.	Naneke mele eme nɛ o.
And so that exists now.	Eye ale be ema li fifia.

Not here, not anywhere.	Menye afisia o, menye afi aɖeke o.
We can’t talk about that.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu o.
I guess that was another time.	Mesusu be ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖee nye ema.
The room was very small.	Xɔa me nɔ sue ŋutɔ.
A strong wind blew in my face.	Ya sesẽ aɖe ƒo ɖe mo nam.
That’s a very complicated thing.	Ema nye nusi me kɔ ŋutɔ.
Consider which one it is.	Bu eŋu kpɔ be kae nye esi.
Come, get up.	Va, tso.
I had a better idea, anyway.	Susu si nyo wu nɔ asinye, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
None of them came to anything.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meva ɖo naneke gbɔ o.
Many people work long hours here.	Ame geɖe wɔa dɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe le afisia.
He never asked a question.	Mebia nya aɖeke kpɔ o.
Two men in her life.	Ŋutsu eve siwo nɔ eƒe agbe me.
Like a man.	Abe ŋutsu ene.
It will come to an end.	Ava wu enu tututu.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Edze abe nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie ene.
There is absolutely nothing against this.	Naneke metsi tre ɖe esia ŋu kura o.
It would make more sense.	Anye nusi me susu le wu.
Can someone please help.	Taflatse ɖe ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu.
It’s a very interesting thing.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
It is the same rule.	Enye se ma ke.
It is not a system.	Menye ɖoɖo aɖee wònye o.
He's not enjoying it.	Menye ɖe wòle dzidzɔ kpɔm ɖe eŋu o.
I couldn’t imagine who this man was.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ amesi ŋutsu sia nye le susu me o.
This didn’t do anything.	Esia mewɔ naneke o.
There is a characteristic.	Nɔnɔme aɖe li.
It might have taken a week or more.	Ðewohĩ axɔ kwasiɖa ɖeka alo esi wu nenema hafi.
I need to work on myself.	Ele be mawɔ dɔ tso ɖokuinye ŋu.
I can’t do anything about this.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso esia ŋu o.
A good person.	Ame nyui aɖe.
And for how long.	Eye ɣeyiɣi didi kae.
We can keep going.	Míate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim.
And a great name, too.	Eye ŋkɔ gã aɖe hã.
He wasn't angry now.	Medo dziku fifia o.
I’ve got you now.	Mexɔ wò fifia.
Not that anyone asked my opinion.	Menye ɖe ame aɖe bia nye susu o.
And have my way with something.	Eye nye mɔ nanɔ asinye le nane ŋu.
that’s close to it.	ema te ɖe eŋu.
They had a lot to contend with.	Nu geɖe nɔ wo si woawɔ avu kplii.
There is no money for you.	Ga aɖeke meli na wò o.
You will never have time.	Ɣeyiɣi manɔ asiwò gbeɖe o.
And there is no one.	Eye ame aɖeke meli o.
What is this? 	Nukae nye esia?
His character was fine.	Eƒe nɔnɔme nɔ nyuie.
Everything else is fine.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nyo.
Now, come on.	Azɔ, va.
What it is, we don’t know.	Nusi wònye la, míenya o.
A life together.	Agbe si anɔ anyi ɖekae.
There are only a few of these people.	Ame siawo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe li.
No one has ever done this before.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ esia kpɔ o.
It started that night.	Edze egɔme le zã ma me.
The hole is there.	Doa le afima.
I learned a lot about them.	Meva nya nu geɖe tso wo ŋu.
I can’t answer it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo eŋu o.
That seems highly unlikely.	Edze abe ema mate ŋu adzɔ kura o ene.
He came alone, much to my surprise.	Eya ɖeka koe va, eye esia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
Some comments are against it.	Nya aɖewo tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
Few people are working today.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe le dɔ wɔm egbea.
I am still the same.	Megale nenema kokoko.
Allow me to continue.	Ðe mɔ nam be mayi edzi.
The homeless man raised his hand.	Ŋutsu si si aƒe mele o la do asi ɖe dzi.
I didn’t expect it to be like that.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be anɔ nenema o.
In no way whatsoever.	Le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
That never crossed my mind.	Ema meva susu me nam kpɔ o.
If anyone can do it, they can.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu awɔe la, ate ŋui.
I don’t know how he managed.	Nyemenya alesi wòwɔ te ŋui o.
I do that putting my heart into it.	Mewɔa ema tsɔ nye dzi de eme.
Thanks again for everything.	Akpe na mi ake ɖe nusianu ta.
It does happen to be pretty clear what happened.	Edzɔ be nusi dzɔ la me kɔ nyuie ya.
I killed them all.	Nye wu wo katã.
I don’t know what to do.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
The situation I am in.	Nɔnɔme si me mele.
It will save him.	Axɔ nɛ.
But one little thing.	Gake nu sue ɖeka aɖe ya.
In some machines.	Le mɔ̃ aɖewo me.
I get along really well with everyone.	Mewɔa nu nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ kple amesiame.
It's just that simple too.	Ðeko wòle bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe hã.
I’m interested in it.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme.
In that time, a lot has changed.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, nu geɖe trɔ.
I couldn’t find anything.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe naneke ŋu o.
The apartment was in good condition.	Xɔa nɔ nɔnɔme nyui me.
I can’t do it now.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe fifia o.
Through many things.	To nu geɖe me.
Through the night before.	To zã si do ŋgɔ me.
You can’t stay.	Màte ŋu anɔ anyi o.
One year was like another.	Ƒe ɖeka nɔ abe ƒe bubu ene.
I just have a lot going on in my life right now.	Ðeko nu geɖe le edzi yim le nye agbe me fifia.
It has been like this for the past two weeks.	Ele alea kwasiɖa eve siwo va yi.
Now this house.	Azɔ aƒe sia.
Nor did he find anything obviously potentially lethal.	Eye mekpɔ naneke si ate ŋu awu ame si dze ƒã hã le eme o.
He never saw the shooter.	Mekpɔ amesi da tu la kpɔ o.
There wasn’t much space either.	Teƒe boo aɖeke hã menɔ afima o.
Something changed in me.	Nane trɔ le menye.
There is no one who is against it.	Ame aɖeke meli si tsi tre ɖe eŋu o.
I hope so, anyway.	Mekpɔ mɔ be ele nenema, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
He could easily go there.	Ate ŋu ava yi afima bɔbɔe.
You can find everything here.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusianu le afisia.
That will be done in this episode.	Woawɔ ema le akpa sia me.
Everything should be very simple.	Ele be nusianu nanɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
But this guy didn’t.	Gake ŋutsu sia ya mewɔe nenema o.
I think this way will work.	Mesusu be mɔ sia awɔ dɔ.
And just water.	Eye tsi ko.
You will not be alone.	Menye wò ɖeka koe anɔ anyi o.
This is quite the opposite.	Esia to vovo kura na ema.
Now that I see a couple of things about it.	Fifia si mekpɔ nu eve aɖewo tso eŋu.
More and more people are seeing reality.	Ame geɖe wu le nu ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔm.
Maybe I’ll do the same.	Ðewohĩ nye hã mawɔe nenema ke.
This is a great car.	Esia nye ʋu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Winter laughed harder.	Dzomeŋɔli ko nu sesĩe wu.
I don’t know if we’ll have a tomorrow.	Nyemenya nenye be etsɔ aɖe anɔ mía si o.
But something was going on.	Gake nane nɔ edzi yim.
It’s a little weird.	Ewɔ nuku vie.
It is something more than that.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema.
Turn around and reverse.	Trɔ ɖe megbe.
You know what is what.	Ènya nusi nye nusi.
That may surprise some.	Ema ate ŋu awɔ nuku na ame aɖewo.
I think it’s pretty obvious what’s there is there.	Mesusu be edze ƒã ŋutɔ be nusi le afima le afima.
Because of his anger.	Le eƒe dziku ta.
There is no time for that.	Ɣeyiɣi meli na ema o.
Please give the dog a bone.	Taflatse na ƒu aɖe avu la.
I am working on it.	Mele dɔ wɔm tso eŋu.

The morning is coming.	Ŋdi la ɖo.
Not as we are today.	Menye abe alesi míele egbea ene o.
I missed you, too.	Mesusu wò hã.
That must have been kind of a surprise to him.	Ema anya nye nusi wɔ nuku nɛ ƒomevi aɖe.
Which, of course, won’t be the case.	Nusi, le nyateƒe me, manɔ nenema o.
I think one of them got inside.	Mesusu be wo dometɔ ɖeka ge ɖe eme.
Please help me with this problem.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye le kuxi sia me.
Some of them are good in school.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nyo le suku.
Please tell us a bit more about your background.	Taflatse gblɔ nu geɖe tso wò nɔnɔme ŋu na mí vie.

This device presented several problems.	Mɔ̃ sia ɖe kuxi geɖe fia.
The long time has been too long.	Ɣeyiɣi didi la xɔ ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
Its exactly kind of.	Eƒe ƒomevi tututu.
I recognized the voice of one of them.	Mekpɔ wo dometɔ ɖeka ƒe gbe dze sii.
There is something behind it.	Nane le megbe nɛ.
There is no other reason.	Susu bubu aɖeke meli si tae o.
He is at home now.	Ele aƒeme fifia.
And this is now.	Eye esia nye fifia.
I like the way my life is.	Ale si nye agbe le la dzɔa dzi nam.
For some reason just now he doesn’t care.	Le susu aɖewo ta fifia koe metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
It wasn’t any of his business.	Menye eƒe nya aɖeke o.
Some of them arrived late.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo tsi megbe va ɖo.
But really only to the extent that this is relevant.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, afisi esia sɔ le koe.
He didn’t know which way he was.	Menya mɔ si dzi wòle o.
He sang while he worked.	Edzi ha esime wònɔ dɔ wɔm.
That doesn’t matter.	Ema mehiã o.
It’s pretty amazing though.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ ke hã.
It’s really clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I did it this year.	Mewɔe le ƒe sia me.
Probably anything.	Ðewohĩ nusianu.
You’ve always been a good person.	Ènye ame nyui aɖe ɣesiaɣi.
So was another man.	Nenema ke ŋutsu bubu hã nɔ.
This is a lie.	Esia nye alakpa.
That happened about a year ago.	Ema dzɔ abe ƒe ɖeka enye sia ene.
I should have known you better.	Ðe wòle be manya wò nyuie wu hafi.
On your face.	Le wò mo ŋu.
Just do the same thing.	Ðeko nàwɔ nu ma ke.
Everything must be ready.	Ele be nusianu nanɔ klalo.
After that, only once a week.	Le ema megbe la, zi ɖeka koe le kwasiɖa me.
I see nothing to support this claim.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si aɖo kpe nya sia dzi o.
That’s all we want.	Ema koe nye míaƒe didi.
All work well with this system.	Wo katã wɔa dɔ nyuie kple ɖoɖo sia.
I want to talk to you a little bit.	Medi be maƒo nu vie kpli mi.
I will take care of this.	Makpɔ esia gbɔ.
We have a lot to do.	Nu geɖe le mía si míawɔ.
No one is like that.	Ame aɖeke mele nenema o.
I was too old.	Metsi akpa.
I hope they are.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wole nenema.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It will hit someone almost as hard as you.	Aƒo ame aɖe vevie abe wò ene kloe.
The lake is already frozen.	Ta la xɔ dzo xoxo.
The whole thing.	Nya bliboa.
I came.	Meva.
Now, one last chance.	Fifia, mɔnukpɔkpɔ mamlɛtɔ ɖeka.
They were all involved.	Wo katã hã nɔ eme.
Like this guy.	Abe ŋutsu sia ene.
And you’re right that it’s all over him.	Eye wò tɔ dzɔ be wo katã le edzi.
We have a life.	Agbe le mía si.
And so are people.	Eye amewo hã le nenema.
You can do that while we have you.	Àte ŋu awɔ ema esime wò le mía si.
This in itself should not be surprising.	Mele be esia ŋutɔ nawɔ nuku na ame o.
Honestly, I can’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋui o.
It seems so simple.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ ene.
But only in one case.	Gake le nɔnɔme ɖeka me koe.
The end result remains the same.	Nusi ado tso eme mlɔeba la gakpɔtɔ le nenema.
Something or someone was involved.	Nane alo ame aɖe nɔ eme.
Now, everything has changed.	Fifia, nusianu trɔ.
What hit us was one of them.	Nusi dze mía dzi la nye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
I will continue to fight for them in this space.	Mayi edzi anɔ avu wɔm ɖe wo ta le teƒe sia.
Come to what might happen.	Va nusi ate ŋu adzɔ.
So we know this day is coming.	Eya ta míenya be ŋkeke sia gbɔna.
That’s our normal.	Emae nye míaƒe nusi sɔ.
It’s a difficult situation to achieve these days.	Enye nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe si gbɔ ɖoɖo le ŋkeke siawo me.
Salt is a liquid substance.	Dze nye nusi me tsi le.
My dog ​​is very small.	Nye avu le sue ŋutɔ.
Police eventually found her attacker.	Kpovitɔwo va ke ɖe ame si dze edzi la ŋu mlɔeba.
This is simply not possible.	Ðeko esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
The work is not difficult.	Dɔa menye dɔ sesẽ o.
It will be something.	Anye nane.
I’m glad he’s here.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ele afisia.
But there are some problems.	Gake kuxi aɖewo li.
A little difficult in the matter of alcohol.	Sesẽ vie le aha sesẽ ƒe nya la me.
I was nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe.
Meet them where they are.	Do go wo le afisi wole.
I hope and trust that will not be the case.	Mele mɔ kpɔm eye meka ɖe edzi be manɔ nenema o.
Not just eyes or feet.	Menye ŋku alo afɔ ko o.
That seems to have worked.	Edze abe ema wɔ dɔ ene.
I don’t have a voice like that.	Gbe aɖeke mele asinye nenema o.
You need to keep these points in mind.	Ele be nya siawo nanɔ susu me na wò.
The location of the house is perfect.	Afisi aƒea le la sɔ nyuie.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe li siwo tae.
But there is more to be done.	Gake nu geɖe li woawɔ.
Nothing will ever be the same.	Naneke manɔ abe tsã ene gbeɖe o.
Now he looked at them all with a certain anger.	Fifia etsɔ dziku aɖe kpɔ wo katã.
However, it can happen to anyone.	Ke hã, ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe ame sia ame dzi.
Finally, someone was talking to him.	Mlɔeba la, ame aɖe nɔ nu ƒom nɛ.
This section works.	Akpa sia wɔa dɔ.
But tonight was different.	Gake zã sia ya to vovo.
Four men entered.	Ŋutsu ene ge ɖe eme.
And yet he never did.	Eye ke hã mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
He didn’t care about her at all.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ kura o.
That’s a whole different thing.	Ema nye nu si to vovo kura.
But that’s easy.	Gake ema le bɔbɔe.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
This is definitely not true.	Esia menye nyateƒe o godoo.
To make everything about it.	Be woawɔ nu sia nu tso eŋu.
This is when, a long time ago now.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi si me, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia fifia.
It’s just the truth.	Nyateƒea koe wònye.
We have to do this every year.	Ele be míawɔ esia ƒe sia ƒe.
It was very personal and very real.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ ŋutɔ eye wònye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
There is nothing.	Naneke meli o.
So should you, too.	Nenema ke wòle be wò hã.
I just don’t know.	Ðeko nyemenya o.
This is very difficult.	Esia sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Everything has changed.	Nusianu trɔ.
Call them in the afternoon.	Ƒo ka na wo le ŋdɔ me.
Because of this, it doesn’t work.	Le esia ta la, mewɔa dɔ o.
They’re taking care of that kind of thing.	Wole nu ma ƒomevi dzi kpɔm.
He never did anything wrong.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke kpɔ o.
In this paper.	Le agbalẽ sia me la.
A mistake simply could not have happened.	Ðeko vodada aɖe mate ŋu adzɔ hafi o.
That’s what’s missing, let go.	Emae nye nusi bu, ɖe asi le eŋu.
The truth is very different.	Nyateƒea to vovo kura na tsã.
He had never seen one.	Mekpɔ ɖeke kpɔ o.
There is a reason for it.	Susu aɖe li si tae.
This was previously impossible.	Esia nye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ tsã o.
I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.	Nyemate ŋu adi teƒe si nyo wu be manɔ o.
The work is very difficult.	Dɔa sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I say almost four times, no big deal.	Megblɔ be zi gbɔ zi ene kloe, menye nya gã aɖeke o.
This is going to be a very, very exciting year.	Esia anye ƒe si me dzidzɔ le ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
Yet no one is here anymore.	Ke hã ame aɖeke megale afisia o.
He didn’t believe me.	Mexɔ dzinye se o.
You can do this for me.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia nam.
That’s my bad thing.	Emae nye nye nu gbegblẽ.
The day has arrived.	Ŋkeke la ɖo.
Not sure if that’s a good idea or not.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be susu nyui aɖee nye ema loo alo menye nenema o.
We need to stay away from this!	Ele be míate ɖa le esia ŋu!
I don’t want to see anyone.	Nyemedi be makpɔ ame aɖeke o.
He couldn't think of that possibility now.	Mete ŋu bu nu ma si ate ŋu adzɔ ŋu fifia o.
But that’s not the only thing.	Gake menye nu ɖeka koe nye ema o.
We’re here to stay.	Míele afisia.
Hard, not so much.	Sesẽ, menye nenema gbegbe o.
If you have something to say, go ahead.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò nàgblɔ la, yi edzi.
I do remember that.	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi nyateƒe.
I had no part in his life.	Akpa aɖeke menɔ asinye le eƒe agbe me o.
He didn’t say much today.	Megblɔ nya geɖe egbea o.
He never wanted this.	Medi esia kpɔ o.
He never tried.	Medze agbagba kpɔ o.
I was fighting for them.	Menɔ avu wɔm ɖe wo ta.
And do it.	Eye wɔe.
None of them wanted to go.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke medi be yeayi o.
But this was not the case at all.	Gake esia menɔ alea kura o.
Say the same first name.	Gblɔ ŋkɔ gbãtɔ ma ke.
He didn’t in this case.	Mewɔe le go sia me o.
Everything was excellent.	Nusianu nyo ŋutɔ.
In fact, there is nothing that will make you happy.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke meli si ado dzidzɔ na wò o.
Something is going on.	Nane le edzi yim.
The strange ones.	Ame siwo mewɔ nuku o la.
People stare at me.	Amewo doa ŋku ɖe ŋunye.
The police finally arrived.	Kpovitɔwo va ɖo mlɔeba.
What a waste of time and money.	Ɣeyiɣi kple ga gbegblẽ kae nye si.
He just liked people.	Ðeko amewo ƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
I felt a little sick.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be medze dɔ vie.
One of them came and grabbed my neck tightly.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka va lé nye kɔ nyuie.
I’ve seen this before.	Mekpɔ esia kpɔ.
Some of us ran away.	Mía dometɔ aɖewo si dzo.
It is a very advanced thing.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ ŋutɔ.
Perhaps it is possible.	Ðewohĩ anya wɔ.
There are some issues.	Nya aɖewo li.
The task became too difficult for him.	Dɔa va sesẽ nɛ akpa.
There was a police force there.	Kpovitɔwo ƒe ha aɖe nɔ afima.
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
It’s two very different situations.	Enye nɔnɔme eve siwo to vovo kura.
He seemed to have lost his voice altogether.	Edze abe eƒe gbe bu kura ene.
I'm going to work.	Mele dɔ wɔ ge.
For the first time in my life.	Zi gbãtɔ le nye agbe me.
We don’t know what the truth is.	Míenya nusi nye nyateƒea o.
I don’t know if that’s right though.	Nyemenya nenye be esia sɔ o ke hã.
However, it is never the case.	Ke hã, mele nenema gbeɖe o.
I’m really happy for that.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ɖe ema ta.
Maybe the guy next door would do that well.	Ðewohĩ ŋutsu si te ɖe mía ŋu la awɔ nu ma nyuie.
Which is.	Nusi nye.
A few books.	Agbalẽ ʋɛ aɖewo.
None of us knew what to do.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke menya nusi wòawɔ o.
He was obviously seriously ill.	Edze ƒã be edze dɔ vevie.
We can’t stay here.	Míate ŋu anɔ afisia o.
Maybe there is something wrong with them.	Ðewohĩ nya aɖe le wo ŋu.
Think of a difficult situation you are going through.	Bu nu sesẽ aɖe si me tom nèle la ŋu kpɔ.
It’s a very different place.	Enye teƒe si to vovo kura.
It is very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ.
But no one really is.	Gake ame aɖeke mele nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Just a few days.	Ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
In the same room.	Le xɔ ɖeka me.
That’s not exactly true.	Ema menye nyateƒe tututu o.
The death toll among the police was high.	Ame siwo ku le kpovitɔwo dome la sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
I was going to save his life.	Menɔ eƒe agbe xɔ ge.
But this is the only downside.	Gake esia koe nye nusi gblẽ le eŋu.
I had never seen so many of them in one place.	Nyemekpɔ wo dometɔ geɖe le teƒe ɖeka nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
I know more about it than you do.	Menya nu geɖe tso eŋu wu wò.
Now it’s private.	Fifia enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
Approach your death.	Te ɖe wò ku ŋu.
He didn’t know himself.	Menya eɖokui o.
But not just once.	Gake menye zi ɖeka ko o.
Late.	Tsi megbe.
More like the opposite.	Nu geɖe wu abe nusi to vovo na ema ene.
In the hole.	Le doa me.
It is impossible	Manya wɔ o .
I’m fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam.
Each is important in its own way.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe le vevie le eƒe mɔ nu.
And it will work well.	Eye awɔ dɔ nyuie.
He didn’t expect that either.	Mekpɔ mɔ nenema hã o.
In addition to the money.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe ga la ŋu.
Maybe they missed something.	Ðewohĩ nane to wo ŋu.
Explain the reason for it.	Ðe susu si tae.
But one thing is certain.	Gake nu ɖekae nye be.
Everyone was working on the same thing.	Amesiame nɔ dɔ wɔm tso nu ɖeka la ŋu.
But there are two conditions.	Gake nɔnɔme eve aɖewo li.
There are very few now.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe li fifia.
I am sure it would have been very interesting.	Meka ɖe edzi be anye ne adzɔ dzi na ame ŋutɔ.
Many people have tried.	Ame geɖe te kpɔ.
I know we can do it.	Menya be míate ŋu awɔe.
This will be the last one.	Esia anye mamlɛtɔ.
He didn’t seem to have much.	Edze abe nu geɖe menɔ esi o ene.
There was nothing about that.	Naneke menɔ ema ŋu o.
Only a few people	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe
But it isn’t.	Gake mele eme o.
The reason is important.	Susu la le vevie.
Everything is going well.	Nusianu le edzi yim nyuie.
That’s what it did.	Ema wɔe.
However, this doesn’t work.	Ke hã, esia mewɔa dɔ o.
The fit is excellent.	Nusi sɔ la nyo ŋutɔ.
You don’t have to do anything.	Mehiã be nàwɔ naneke o.
There was very little air.	Ya sue aɖe koe nɔ anyi.
I did everything I could.	Mewɔ nusianu si mate ŋui.
This has become very expensive.	Esia va xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
That’s really important to me.	Ema le vevie nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I've had enough, thank you.	Mekpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ, akpe na wò.
It will be really useful.	Aɖe vi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That was very hot.	Ema xɔ dzo ŋutɔ.
Its too hard that way.	Eƒe sesẽ akpa le mɔ ma nu.
You just can’t win.	Ðeko màte ŋu aɖu dzi o.
This is a rather obvious pitfall.	Esia nye mɔ̃ si dze ƒã vie.
Summer is our season.	Dzomeŋɔli nye míaƒe ɣeyiɣi.
His work began.	Eƒe dɔa dze egɔme.
Not everyone knows every day.	Menye ame sia ame nya gbe sia gbe o.
I was the only one left.	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
It is all that needs to be done now.	Eya koe nye nu si wòle be woawɔ fifia.
They had a dog.	Avu aɖe nɔ wo si.
This is not a quick fix.	Esia menye nusi woawɔ kaba o.
I think you will enjoy it.	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò.
I have been there and done that.	Menɔ afima eye mewɔe nenema.
And he was the only one.	Eye eya ɖeka koe nye ema.
You can’t be everything to everyone.	Màte ŋu anye nusianu na amesiame o.
What is his name.	Nukae nye eƒe ŋkɔ.
Which is not a good thing for me.	Nusi menye nu nyui aɖeke nam o.
I probably don’t want to know.	Anɔ eme be nyemedi be manya o.
That was my first thought.	Emae nye nye susu gbãtɔ.
No one told him to do this.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nɛ be wòawɔ esia o.
I just need to find out who it is.	Ðeko wòle be madi amesi nye.
But he made a mistake.	Gake ewɔ vodada.
I felt terrible for him.	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ɖe eŋu.
Police were still behind him.	Kpovitɔwo gakpɔtɔ nɔ megbe nɛ.
This will be a problem if a component does not fit properly.	Esia anye kuxi ne akpa aɖe mewɔ ɖeka nyuie o.
I remember it so well.	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie ale gbegbe.
Need the money.	Hiã na ga la.
Again, this means planning multiple times.	Le afisia hã la, esia fia be nàwɔ ɖoɖo zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
It wouldn’t make sense.	Susu manɔ eme o.
It could have been anyone.	Ate ŋu anye amesiame hafi.
This has happened several times now.	Esia dzɔ zi geɖe fifia.
I got along well with him.	Mewɔ ɖeka kplii nyuie.
It’s very clear.	Eme kɔ ŋutɔ.
It doesn’t matter what you do between two jobs.	Nu si nàwɔ le dɔ eve dome la mehiã o.
Otherwise, it’s a good plan.	Ne menye nenema o la, enye ɖoɖo nyui aɖe.
I had a gun in my hand.	Tu nɔ asinye.
I know exactly where everyone is.	Menya afisi amesiame le nyuie.
Something was obviously wrong with his car.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ le eƒe ʋua ŋu.
That’s just two of them.	Eve koe nye ema.
He’s so focused.	Eƒe susu le nu ŋu ale gbegbe.
I am not like that.	Nyemele alea o.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
He was obviously nervous too.	Edze ƒã be eya hã tsi dzodzodzoe.
This makes more sense.	Esia me susu le wu.
But none of this is true.	Gake nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
I got this one.	Mexɔ esia.
But not with him.	Gake menye kplii o.
I can’t understand them.	Nyemate ŋu ase wo gɔme o.
That wasn’t me.	Menye nyee nye ema o.
I have been worried about you.	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò kpɔ.
That seems strange to me.	Ema dze nam be ewɔ nuku nam.
The dog was too quick for him.	Avu la wɔ kaba akpa nɛ.
Someone gave a command.	Ame aɖe de se aɖe.
Please come back here soon.	Taflatse trɔ va afisia kpuie.
I do the opposite.	Mewɔa nusi to vovo na ema.
I promise to call you today.	Medo ŋugbe be maƒo ka na wò egbea.
It was a small room.	Xɔ sue aɖee wònye.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I knew something was wrong.	Menya be nane gblẽ.
Like, more stuff.	Abe, nu geɖe wu ene.
If that doesn’t work, try something a little more challenging.	Ne ema mewɔ dɔ o la, te nane si sesẽ vie kpɔ.
The structure of the project is as follows.	Dɔa ƒe ɖoɖo le ale.
He was a good guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖee wònye.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I just did what I had to do.	Ðeko mewɔ nusi wòle be mawɔ.
I think a lot of people were like that.	Mesusu be ame geɖe nɔ nenema.
We know we can do better.	Míenya be míate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu.
One year is enough.	Ƒe ɖeka sɔ gbɔ.
And, we can give life.	Eye, míate ŋu ana agbe.
Man, this is so good.	Ŋutsu, esia nyo ŋutɔ.
No one else is going to do it for them.	Ame bubu aɖeke mele ewɔ ge na wo o.
Many lives were lost.	Ame geɖe ƒe agbe bu.
There was nothing there, of course.	Naneke menɔ afima ya o.
Maybe that would be better.	Ðewohĩ emae anyo wu.
But that’s enough.	Gake ema sɔ gbɔ.
We cannot go on living together.	Míate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ agbe ɖekae o.
There is no one who can help you.	Ame aɖeke meli si ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò o.
The car could go no further.	Ʋua mete ŋu yi ŋgɔ wu ema o.
We don’t have to fight.	Mehiã be míawɔ avu o.
But it is there.	Gake ele afima.
It’s not that bad.	Menye nu gbegblẽ nenema gbegbe o.
But he didn’t understand.	Gake mese egɔme o.
Think about what we can do together.	Bu nu siwo míate ŋu awɔ ɖekae ŋu kpɔ.
This went on for months.	Esia yi edzi ɣleti geɖe.
I can be there for you.	Mate ŋu anɔ afima na wò.
That’s a lot of good stuff.	Ema nye nu nyui geɖe ŋutɔ.
Everyone seemed to think this was a good idea.	Edze abe amesiame susui be esia nye susu nyui aɖe ene.
He will go with you.	Ayi kpli wò.
I know you.	Menya wò.
It just didn’t, of course.	Ðeko mewɔe nenema ya o.
Something isn’t working.	Nane mele dɔ wɔm o.
But the opposite is true.	Gake nusi to vovo na emae.
Longer, but not better.	Didi wu, gake menye esi nyo wu o.
Which would be one.	Nusi anye ɖeka.
No one trusted them.	Ame aɖeke meka ɖe wo dzi o.
I have a rule about this.	Se aɖe le asinye le esia ŋu.
But there was no space.	Gake teƒe aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I had never heard of it.	Nyemese nu tso eŋu kpɔ o.
I had no other way in mind.	Mɔ bubu aɖeke menɔ susu me nam o.
I couldn’t relax with them in the room.	Nyemete ŋu ɖi ɖe eme kpli wo le xɔa me o.
No one is doing that for you.	Ame aɖeke mele nu ma wɔm na wò o.
It’s a challenge, a real challenge.	Enye kuxi, kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But I couldn’t tell him that properly.	Gake nyemete ŋu gblɔ nya ma nɛ nyuie o.
About the project.	Le dɔa ŋu.
Perhaps he will say something.	Ðewohĩ agblɔ nya aɖe.
It’s amazing, actually.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
He needed surgery.	Ehiã be woawɔ dɔ nɛ.
Or in another way.	Alo le mɔ bubu nu.
Independent.	Le eɖokui si.
This is also my plan.	Esia hã nye nye ɖoɖo.
But you know what happened.	Gake ènya nusi dzɔ.
The school in .	Suku si le .
These people have lost everything.	Ame siawo bu nusianu.
You are a good person.	Ènye ame nyui aɖe.

He is doing well for himself.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie na eɖokui.
Use your head.	Zã wò ta.
I don’t trust any of them.	Nyemeka ɖe wo dometɔ aɖeke dzi o.
Clearly, this will not be easy.	Edze ƒã be esia manɔ bɔbɔe o.
It doesn’t stand very tall.	Metsi tre ɖe dzi ŋutɔ o.
Life is not cheap in this city.	Agbe mexɔ asi le du sia me o.
These things can contaminate anything.	Nu siawo ate ŋu aƒo ɖi nusianu.
That was the last of them.	Emae nye wo dometɔ mamlɛtɔ.
I'm knocking the thing down.	Mele nu la ƒom ɖe anyi.
They only have money.	Ga koe le wo si.
Clearly, he wasn’t in it for the money.	Edze ƒã be menye ga la tae wònɔ eme o.
If you can’t win, at least be in it.	Ne màte ŋu aɖu dzi o la, nɔ eme ya teti.
Be a part of this!.	Nye esia ƒe akpa aɖe!.
That looks like a good fit, right there.	Ema le abe amesi sɔ nyuie ene, le afima tututu.
More opportunities for everyone.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe wu na amesiame.
I have two dogs and a cat.	Avu eve kple avu ɖeka le asinye.
The snake ran away.	Da la ƒu du dzo.
Clearly, we must act now.	Edze ƒã be ele be míawɔ nu fifia.
But that was beautiful too.	Gake ema hã nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
It is very short.	Ele kpuie ŋutɔ.
But it was clear enough.	Gake eme kɔ nyuie ale gbegbe.
It will take him more time.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu nɛ.
Maybe you’re ready, maybe you’re not.	Ðewohĩ èle klalo, ɖewohĩ mèle klalo o.
He could have stayed with us.	Ate ŋu anɔ mía gbɔ hafi.
That was a big moment for me.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe nam.
This one will do the same.	Esia hã awɔe nenema.
I'm not exactly surprised with this.	Mewɔ nuku nam tututu kple esia o.
And you have absolutely no idea.	Eye susu aɖeke kura mele asiwò o.
He had never seen them.	Mekpɔ wo kpɔ o.
So long ago .	Ale gbegbe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia .
I have a lot of things.	Nu geɖe le asinye.
The dog looked tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te avu la ŋu ene.
There is plenty of help for everyone.	Kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe li na amesiame.
This worried me.	Esia tsi dzi nam.
Many cars were damaged.	Ʋu geɖe gblẽ.
However, the point is clear.	Ke hã, nya la me kɔ nyuie.
The work is now in progress.	Dɔa le edzi yim fifia.
There is more to it.	Nu geɖe wu le eme.
Just a little bit.	Vi aɖe ko.
Use what you like.	Zã nu si dze ŋuwò.
Something like this should work.	Ele be nane si le abe esia ene nawɔ dɔ.
It made sense, too.	Susu nɔ eme hã.
I think he’s a really nice guy.	Mesusu be enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I did, but that doesn’t matter now.	Mewɔe, gake ema mele vevie fifia o.
It will also be the last.	Anye mamlɛtɔ hã.
I will tell you what will happen.	Magblɔ nusi adzɔ la na wò.
This is what you are doing for you.	Esia nye nusi wɔm nèle na wò.
He can’t do that.	Mate ŋu awɔ ema o.
He was just here.	Ðeko wònɔ afisia.
The room was warm.	Xɔa me xɔ dzo.
No one was looking for them.	Ame aɖeke menɔ wo dim o.
His mind was elsewhere.	Eƒe susu nɔ teƒe bubu aɖe.
That’s as good a word as any.	Ema nye nya nyui aɖe abe nya ɖesiaɖe ene.
I can’t remember exactly what it was.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nusi tututu wònye dzi o.
The meeting lasted a long time.	Kpekpea xɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
That was very interesting to you.	Ema do dzidzɔ na wò ŋutɔ.
It was very quick.	Enye kaba ŋutɔ.
I don’t know if that’s a good idea.	Nyemenya nenye be susu nyui aɖee nye ema o.
And that’s a good thing.	Eye ema nye nu nyui aɖe.
To anyone and everyone here.	Na amesiame kple amesiame le afisia.
The building is very bad.	Xɔa gblẽ ŋutɔ.
But he wasn’t here.	Gake menɔ afisia o.
He liked the result.	Nusi do tso eme la dze eŋu.
Probably more than that.	Ðewohĩ nu geɖe wu ema.
It was so obvious he didn’t know what to do.	Edze ƒã ale gbegbe be menya nusi wòawɔ o.
He didn’t know what he was doing.	Menya nu si wɔm wòle o.
Be the best thing.	Nye nusi nyo wu.
He needed no one but himself.	Mehiã ame bubu aɖeke wu eya ŋutɔ o.
I’m so glad I was able to do that.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mete ŋu wɔ nu ma.
He can be watching everything.	Ate ŋu anɔ nusianu kpɔm.
He never cared much for me.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme nam boo kpɔ o.
He didn’t let her.	Meɖe mɔ nɛ o.
Not a small part of it.	Menye eƒe akpa sue aɖee o.
He had no head or feet.	Ta alo afɔ aɖeke menɔ esi o.
And this other time.	Eye ɣeyiɣi bubu sia hã.
In one way or another.	Le mɔ aɖe nu alo bubu nu.
He couldn't say anything.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Not that there’s anything wrong with that.	Menye be nane gblẽ le ema ŋu o.
I was seriously ill.	Medze dɔ vevie.
It was like last week.	Enye abe alesi wònɔ le kwasiɖa si va yi me ene.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That will come next week.	Ema ava le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me.
Like everything is beautiful.	Abe alesi nusianu nya kpɔ ene.
But he would have something to think about.	Gake nane ŋu bubu anɔ eŋu.
I would definitely be embarrassed.	Ŋu akpe nam godoo.
He was a good dog.	Avu nyui aɖee wònye.
He never got angry.	Medo dziku gbeɖe o.
I have a job to do.	Dɔ le asinye mawɔ.
This is a difficult issue.	Esia nye nya sesẽ aɖe.
Add a little salt to this.	Tsɔ dze vi aɖe de esia me.
Until the last word.	Vaseɖe nya mamlɛtɔ dzi.
It’s not ‘us’ or ‘them’.	Menye ‘mí’ alo ‘wo’ o.
But there was something in his voice.	Gake nane nɔ eƒe gbe me.
That’s very worthy of me.	Ema dze nam ŋutɔ.
There weren’t many new ones.	Wo dometɔ yeye geɖe menɔ anyi o.
Things are simple.	Nuwo le bɔbɔe.
Now, something else.	Azɔ, nu bubu aɖe hã.
Everything was the same, but everything was different.	Nusianu nɔ ɖeka, gake nusianu to vovo.
He rubbed his face with his hand.	Etsɔ asi ƒo eƒe mo.
It will work.	Awɔ dɔ.
You have no time in mind.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke mele susu me na wò o.
They were all stained with blood.	Wo katã ʋu ƒo ɖi wo.
This has happened at least twice in the last year.	Esia dzɔ zi eve ya teti le ƒe si va yi me.
This guy is nice.	Ŋutsu sia ƒe nu nyo.
The immigrants became furious.	Ame siwo ʋu va la va do dziku vevie.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
Nothing here for me right now.	Naneke mele afisia nam fifia o.
There must be another way.	Ele be mɔ bubu aɖe nanɔ anyi.
This need not surprise us at all.	Mehiã be esia nawɔ nuku na mí kura o.
Paradoxically, it is not working.	Nusi to vovo na emae nye be mele dɔ wɔm o.
It was the perfect place.	Enye teƒe si sɔ nyuie.
Your mouth is wet.	Wò nu ƒo tsi.
Maybe he lost his mind.	Ðewohĩ eƒe susu bu.
And that’s contagious.	Eye ema nye nusi xɔa ame me.
I have no issue with that.	Nya aɖeke mele ŋunye le ema ŋu o.
Go home.	Yi aƒeme.
It is my passion and my past.	Enye nye didi vevie kple nye ɣeyiɣi si va yi.
And he will do the same.	Eye eya hã awɔe nenema.
However, they had a problem.	Ke hã, kuxi aɖe nɔ wo ŋu.
It may be true.	Ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
Look at your back that.	Kpɔ wò megbe ɖa be.
He didn’t like that idea.	Susu ma medze eŋu o.
I like this kind of piece.	Akpa sia ƒomevi dzɔa dzi nam.
He had a great thing.	Nu gã aɖe nɔ esi.
You can get over that in a few days.	Àte ŋu aɖu ema dzi le ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo megbe.
I think that’s pretty good.	Mesusu be ema nyo ŋutɔ.
Now this is totally absurd.	Fifia esia nye nusi me susu mele kura o.
No one will be here.	Ame aɖeke manɔ afisia o.
That’s more than enough for me today.	Ema sɔ gbɔ wu esi sɔ gbɔ nam egbea.
This is a work in progress.	Esia nye dɔ si le edzi yim.
If only things were a little different.	Ne ɖe nuwo to vovo vie ko hafi.
Yet it is not.	Ke hã mele alea o.
Do this entire process twice a week.	Wɔ dɔ sia katã zi eve le kwasiɖa me.
Yet you can never say never.	Ke hã màte ŋu agblɔ gbeɖe be gbeɖe o.
He will probably be there.	Anye be anɔ afima.
This smoke caused several deaths last year.	Dzudzɔ sia na ame geɖe ku le ƒe si va yi me.
But that’s just me.	Gake nye koe nye ema.
We don’t need to hurry.	Mehiã be míawɔ kaba o.
I’ve seen that kind of thing before.	Mekpɔ nu ma ƒomevi do ŋgɔ.
This was a big moment for me.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe nam.
That’s a big part.	Ema nye akpa gã aɖe.
I want one in my home.	Medi be ɖeka nanɔ nye aƒeme.
But some things take time.	Gake nu aɖewo xɔa ɣeyiɣi.
It didn’t work, it didn’t behave.	Mewɔ dɔ o, mewɔ nu o.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
To save myself.	Be maɖe ɖokuinye.
I don’t know what happened to him now.	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi fifia o.
At home and in our very hearts.	Le aƒeme kple míaƒe dzi ŋutɔ me.
Here are a few reasons why.	Susu ʋɛ aɖewo siwo tae nye esi.
It certainly worked well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie godoo.
It can easily escape.	Ate ŋu asi bɔbɔe.
Now, it looks like we’re on our way.	Fifia, edze abe míele mɔ dzi ene.
That was me again.	Nyee nye ema ake.
But it still won’t work.	Gake mawɔ dɔ kokoko o.
It was a difficult time.	Ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖee wònye.
It is with simple task.	Enye kple dɔ bɔbɔe.
But it's not working tonight.	Gake mele dɔ wɔm le zã sia me o.
Each of them did that.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe wɔe nenema.
It seems more so than ever.	Edze abe ɖe wòle nenema wu tsã ene.
Save you all.	Ðe mi katã ŋu.
He did not know how long he had been here.	Menya ɣeyiɣi didi si wònɔ afisia o.
There is no logical reason for that.	Susu aɖeke meli si me susu le si tae wòle nenema ɖo o.
I felt it in myself.	Mese le ɖokuinye me.
He appealed to all ages.	Eƒe nu lé dzi na ƒe ɖesiaɖe.
Many knew them before the age of two.	Ame geɖe nya wo hafi xɔ ƒe eve.
Get a little closer.	Te ɖe eŋu vie.
He had too much to do.	Nu geɖe nɔ esi wòawɔ akpa.
There’s something really great about that.	Nu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ le ema ŋu.
Many people seem to be unaware of this.	Edze abe ame geɖe menya nu tso nya sia ŋu o ene.
However this, clearly, will not work.	Ke hã esia, eme kɔ ƒã be, mawɔ dɔ o.
You don’t want to work there anyway.	Mèdi be yeawɔ dɔ le afima le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I look forward to seeing your work.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be makpɔ wò dɔa.
I just did it.	Ðeko mewɔe.

But many may not be convinced.	Gake ɖewohĩ ame geɖe meka ɖe edzi o.
Among themselves.	Le wo nɔewo dome.
So much for that.	Ale gbegbe be esia sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
The small head.	Ta sue la.
I had to plan for it.	Ele be mawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
Now, take a break.	Azɔ, gbɔ ɖe eme vie.
Which is dough for many men.	Nusi nye wɔa na ŋutsu geɖe.
Two things have come out of this.	Nu eve do tso esia me.
This can take hours.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe.
Going on about how it’s a system.	Yi edzi le alesi wònye ɖoɖo aɖe ŋu.
Not what exists for in.	Menye nusi li na le.
Clearly, this is not the case.	Edze ƒã be esia mele alea o.
Everything was going according to plan.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim le ɖoɖo nu.
But he liked it.	Gake edzɔ dzi nɛ.
What it is.	Nusi wònye.
I talked to him last week.	Meɖo dze kplii le kwasiɖa si va yi me.
I can do anything.	Mate ŋu awɔ nusianu.
I will be there for at least a week.	Manɔ afima kwasiɖa ɖeka ya teti.
Another way is good.	Mɔ bubu aɖee nyo.
But he gave it another name.	Gake etsɔ ŋkɔ bubu nɛ.
That says something.	Ema gblɔ nya aɖe.
But he too was looking back.	Gake eya hã nɔ megbe kpɔm.
I wanted something else.	Medi nu bubu aɖe.
That’s a really big deal.	Ema nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This was very easy.	Esia nɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I understood too well.	Mese egɔme nyuie akpa.
When you speak, people will listen.	Ne èle nu ƒom la, amewo aɖo to.
But well, maybe this isn’t a problem.	Gake nyuie, ɖewohĩ esia menye kuxi o.
That means work, work, and more work.	Ema fia be woawɔ dɔ, awɔ dɔ, kple dɔ geɖe wu.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
But it’s not true.	Gake menye nyateƒe o.
He had something on his mind.	Nane nɔ susu me nɛ.
I will talk to him.	Maƒo nu kplii.
Ema you me.	Ema wo nam.
That happened once before.	Ema dzɔ zi ɖeka do ŋgɔ.
I did it that way.	Mewɔe nenema.
Please look forward to it!.	Taflatse kpɔ mɔ nɛ vevie!.
In many cases, this is true.	Le go geɖe me la, esia nye nyateƒe.
For us.	Na mí.
But it didn’t last long.	Gake menɔ anyi didi o.
Not much damage.	Menye nu geɖe siwo dome gblẽ o.
That was really hard for us.	Ema sesẽ na mí ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s not surprising.	Ema mewɔ nuku o.
The wind blew hard in his face.	Ya ƒo sesĩe ɖe eƒe mo.
We can do it in two months.	Míate ŋu awɔe le ɣleti eve me.
I only have the first thing.	Nu gbãtɔ koe le asinye.
I would love to see you there.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be makpɔ wò le afima.
This is as simple as that.	Esia le bɔbɔe abe alesi wòle ene.
People are talking about it.	Amewo le nu ƒom tso eŋu.

Now about once every two hours.	Fifia anɔ abe zi ɖeka ene le gaƒoƒo eve ɖesiaɖe me.
I got your back.	Mexɔ wò megbe.
One cannot say more than that.	Ame mate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe wu ema o.
He can’t do anything for us.	Mate ŋu awɔ naneke na mí o.
No wonder you’re tired.	Mewɔ nuku o be ɖeɖi te ŋuwò.
I would say start simple and work your way up.	Magblɔ be dze egɔme bɔbɔe eye nàwɔ dɔ wò mɔ dzi yi dzi.
Our lives were lost.	Míaƒe agbe bu.
There is a large lake nearby.	Ta gã aɖe le afima si te ɖe afima ŋu.
He was the only one who still had the gun.	Eya koe tu la gakpɔtɔ nɔ esi.
Here’s the interesting thing.	Nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame enye si.

Maybe he could but he never tried.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋui gake medze agbagba kpɔ o.
I need time to process it.	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi be mawɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
Think about that for a moment.	Bu nya ma ŋu vie.
This is usually not true.	Zi geɖe la, esia menye nyateƒe o.
They are going to destroy your house.	Wole wò aƒe gblẽ ge.
I wouldn’t be here if that was possible.	Anye ne manɔ afisia nenye be ema ate ŋu adzɔ o.
They have more than enough food.	Nuɖuɖu si sɔ gbɔ wu le wo si.
It will be fun for him.	Ado dzidzɔ nɛ.

If he had one.	Ne ɖe le esi la.
But there is much that is missing.	Gake nu geɖe li siwo bu.
He is the only one there.	Eya ɖeka koe le afima.
These dresses are longer.	Awu siawo didi wu.

Large enough for maybe four people.	Gã ale gbegbe be ɖewohĩ ame ene ate ŋu anɔ eme.
Some men are different.	Ŋutsu aɖewo to vovo.
It’s a new thing.	Enye nu yeye aɖe.
He filed a complaint.	Etsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu.
Check out this place.	Kpɔ teƒe sia ɖa.
You have to act quickly.	Ele be nàwɔ nu kaba.
Not anything like this, with another guy.	Menye naneke si le abe esia ene o, kple ŋutsu bubu aɖe.
But he was very pleased.	Gake edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.

And so that plan really fits.	Eye ale be ɖoɖo ma sɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This job is no exception.	Dɔ sia hã mele eme o.
It was just one day.	Ŋkeke ɖeka koe wònye.
He fled the scene.	Esi dzo.

That’s why he was there.	Esia tae wònɔ afima ɖo.
I hope no one here offends me.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ame aɖeke mele afisia si ado dziku nam o.

You can see literally everything.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusianu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But it wasn’t easy.	Gake menɔ bɔbɔe o.

It’s easy for him.	Ele bɔbɔe nɛ.
An hour must have passed.	Anɔ eme be gaƒoƒo ɖeka va yi.
We’re talking about the market as a whole.	Míele nu ƒom tso asi bliboa ŋu.

His foot stepped on something.	Eƒe afɔ tu afɔ nane dzi.

I had to hurry up and deal with him.	Ele be mawɔ kaba awɔ nu kplii.
Almost everyone has at least one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka ya teti le amesiame kloe si.
This isn’t me, obviously.	Menye nyee nye esia o, edze ƒã.
Only once a week.	Zi ɖeka le kwasiɖa me koe.

I can’t do anything about that.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke le ema ŋu o.

Something for tomorrow.	Nu aɖe na etsɔ.
And my case is very important to me.	Eye nye nya la le vevie nam ŋutɔ.
They are all in one.	Wo katã le ɖeka me.
I wasn’t happy.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
Get away from there.	Te ɖa le afima.
You can fight them.	Àte ŋu awɔ avu kpli wo.

He didn’t care which one it was.	Metsɔ ɖeke le esi wònye me o.
She was alone with her dog.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi kple eƒe avu.
He threw them underwater.	Etsɔ wo ƒu gbe ɖe tsi te.
And he didn’t explain.	Eye meɖe eme o.

I shouldn’t have gone.	Mele be mayi hafi o.

I don’t think he showed up.	Nyemesusu be meɖe eɖokui fia o.
It was a man.	Ŋutsu aɖee.
I thought he might be angry.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ado dziku.
And this is nothing new.	Eye esia menye nu yeye o.
It was never clear.	Menye nusi me kɔ gbeɖe o.
There was nothing he could say or do, of course.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu agblɔ alo awɔ o ya.
That was so frustrating.	Ema te ɖe ame dzi ale gbegbe.
Everyone has these personal aspects.	Ame ŋutɔ ƒe akpa siawo le amesiame si.
He made a very comprehensive book.	Ewɔ agbalẽ si me kɔ ŋutɔ.
You don’t have to do this now.	Mehiã be nàwɔ esia fifia o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There was already something about his voice.	Nu aɖe nɔ eƒe gbe ŋu xoxo.
I know he has questions, but he's not asking them.	Menya be nya aɖewo le esi, gake mele wo biam o.
This we can know.	Esia míate ŋu anya.
Tell him to do things.	Gblɔ nɛ be wòawɔ nuwo.
And this isn’t surprising.	Eye esia mewɔ nuku o.
That much is clear.	Nu ma gbegbe me kɔ ƒã.
There were many contributing factors.	Nu geɖe nɔ anyi siwo kpe ɖe eŋu.
He will fight you.	Awɔ avu kpli wò.
When was it at that time?	Ɣekaɣie wònɔ?
Something is wrong here.	Nane gblẽ le afisia.

More often than not.	Zi geɖe wu.
He seemed to be in a hurry.	Edze abe ɖe wònɔ du dzi ene.
I think it’s a good thing.	Mesusu be enye nu nyui aɖe.
It was a very easy day.	Enye ŋkeke si dzi wònɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
That would be a great thing.	Ema anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
He wasn’t eating.	Menye nu ɖum wònɔ o.
But everyone else seemed to be having a great time.	Gake edze abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔ ene.
This is not easy to do.	Esia wɔwɔ mele bɔbɔe o.

I know you know you want a piece of that.	Menya be ènya be yedi be yeakpɔ ema ƒe akpa aɖe.
He was very satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme ŋutɔ.
You can’t see on that.	Màte ŋu akpɔ nu le ema dzi o.
Get a good rest.	Gbɔ ɖe eme nyuie.
He didn’t do any work himself.	Eya ŋutɔ mewɔ dɔ aɖeke o.
Let me say that one more time.	Mina magblɔ nya ma zi ɖeka ake.
Give it a little more life.	Na agbe geɖe wu nɛ vie.
There, that’s better.	Afima la, ema nyo wu.
There is no need to fight.	Mehiã be woawɔ avu o.
In a sense, you are the casualty.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, wòe nye nusi gblẽ le ŋuwò.
It’s just that way.	Ðeko wòle nenema.
That task requires a stronger coordination.	Dɔ ma bia be woawɔ ɖeka sesĩe wu.
We belong together.	Míenye ɖekae tɔ.
I have to stay here.	Ele be manɔ afisia.
And maybe it doesn’t matter.	Eye ɖewohĩ mehiã o.
That’s the ‘where’.	Emae nye ‘afisi’.
But obviously not this time.	Gake edze ƒã be menye zi sia o.
You know what was going on.	Ènya nusi nɔ edzi yim.

It’s just one thing that’s needed.	Nu ɖeka si hiã koe wònye.
Be thankful we have water.	Da akpe be tsi le mía si.
He had never touched her.	Meka asi eŋu kpɔ o.
And maybe that’s good.	Eye ɖewohĩ ema nyo.

About things never going wrong for you.	Le nuwo ƒe gbegblẽ na wò gbeɖe o ŋu.
The police are not sure what to do.	Kpovitɔwo meka ɖe nusi woawɔ dzi o.
Everything is overpriced here.	Nusianu ƒe asi gbɔ eme le afisia.
Not in the car, not at home, nowhere.	Menye ʋu me o, menye aƒe me o, afi aɖeke meli o.
Everything has a good time and a bad time.	Ɣeyiɣi nyui kple ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ le nusianu si.

It’s clever.	Aɖaŋu le eŋu.

He didn’t like much.	Nu geɖe medze eŋu o.
Maybe we already are.	Ðewohĩ míele nenema xoxo.
Another week ahead.	Kwasiɖa bubu aɖe le ŋgɔ na mí.
Two men stepped forward.	Ŋutsu eve do ɖe ŋgɔ.
That goes for a lot of guys.	Ema yi na ŋutsu geɖe ŋutɔ.
But I have one point.	Gake nya ɖeka le asinye.
And now, he won’t.	Eye fifia, mawɔe o.

And he will fight it.	Eye wòawɔ avu kplii.
He seems to be working on some new material.	Edze abe ele dɔ wɔm tso nu yeye aɖewo ŋu ene.
That would be exciting.	Ema ado dzidzɔ na ame.
There has never been a major fire in this building.	Dzo gã aɖeke meva xɔ sia me kpɔ o.

Its been that kind of week for me.	Eƒe nye kwasiɖa ma ƒomevi nam.
Which is a very, very difficult thing to do.	Nusi nye nusi wɔwɔ sesẽ ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
He started to move forward.	Edze egɔme yi ŋgɔ.
Everyone is mad at you.	Ame sia ame do dziku ɖe ŋuwò.
We are all on your side.	Mí katã míele wò akpa dzi.
It is not so important here.	Mele vevie nenema gbegbe le afisia o.
He would never let himself get too close.	Maɖe mɔ na eɖokui be wòate ɖe eŋu akpa gbeɖe o.
I made a mistake.	Mewɔ vodada aɖe.
Thanks in advance for any help anyone can give.	Akpe na mi do ŋgɔ ɖe kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe si ame aɖe ate ŋu ana ta.

He was such a loser.	Enye amesi bu alea gbegbe.
Move to fresh air.	Ʋu yi ya nyui me.

Always come back.	Trɔ va ɣesiaɣi.
Shoot anything that comes your way.	Da tu nusianu si ava wò mɔ dzi.

They all had a role to play.	Akpa aɖe nɔ wo katã si.

Every year is beautiful.	Ƒe ɖesiaɖe nya kpɔ.
Those present laughed out loud at his death.	Ame siwo nɔ eteƒe la ko nu sesĩe le eƒe ku ta.
I want someone to share my life with.	Medi be ame aɖe magblɔ nye agbe na.
I don’t think it’s a bad thing.	Nyemesusu be enye nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.

What if this and what if that.	Ke ne esia ya ɖe eye ne ema ya ɖe.
But nothing great came of it.	Gake nu gã aɖeke medo tso eme o.
Do it this way, not the other way around.	Wɔe alea, ke menye nenema o.
It will work through it though.	Awɔ dɔ to eme gake.
I was talking to him differently now.	Menɔ nu ƒom nɛ le mɔ bubu nu fifia.

However this may not be the case here.	Ke hã ɖewohĩ nya sia mele afisia o.

But of course, this is too complicated.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, esia sesẽ akpa.
And it is so.	Eye ele nenema.
That didn’t work either.	Ema hã mewɔ dɔ o.

And that takes time and money.	Eye ema bia ɣeyiɣi kple ga.

A thought that is bothering you.	Susu aɖe si le fu ɖem na wò.

On the other hand,	Le go bubu me la, .

He was very satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme ŋutɔ.

More and more people seem to be dieting.	Edze abe ame geɖe wu le nuɖuɖu dzi ɖum ene.
Now they all survive.	Fifia la, wo katã tsi agbe.

None of them worked.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ dɔ o.

And he had nothing else to do.	Eye nu bubu aɖeke menɔ esi wòawɔ wu esia o.
There is absolutely no problem.	Kuxi aɖeke kura meli o.
But there was nothing about it.	Gake naneke menɔ eŋu o.
The problem is didi.	Kuxi didi.
He did his own thing.	Ewɔ eya ŋutɔ ƒe dɔ.
These two are no exception.	Ame eve siawo hã mele eme o.
He doesn’t ask any questions.	Mebiaa nya aɖeke o.
But you are something completely different.	Gake ènye nane si to vovo kura.

Doing everything felt amazing.	Nusianu wɔwɔ se le eɖokui me be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.

And anyone can do it.	Eye ame sia ame ate ŋu awɔe.
No one knows the names we know.	Ame aɖeke menya ŋkɔ siwo míenya o.
You had a bad day and everything changed.	Ŋkeke gbegblẽ aɖe nɔ asiwò eye nusianu trɔ.

But this is also impossible.	Gake esia hã mate ŋu adzɔ o.
He won’t do that.	Mawɔe nenema o.
I understand why this works.	Mese nusita esia wɔa dɔ la gɔme.
No one can know.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu anya o.
Very good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.

Take a closer look, and tell us what you did.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie, eye nàgblɔ nu siwo nèwɔ la na mí.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖeke mele ema ŋu o.

This was more of a challenge than he expected.	Esia nye kuxi wu alesi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ.
In the same way.	Le mɔ ma ke nu.
Live a long and happy life.	Nɔ agbe didi si me dzidzɔ le.
It can be single or multiple.	Ate ŋu anye nya ɖeka alo nya geɖe.
I hope he stays this week.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be anɔ anyi le kwasiɖa sia me.
As a man would, thank you.	Ale si ŋutsu awɔe la, akpe na wò.
But, in the end, he said nothing.	Gake, mlɔeba la, megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I will do anything for you.	Mawɔ nusianu na wò.
There’s plenty of space.	Teƒe sɔ gbɔ le afima.
Squeeze some of the liquid in there as well.	Tsɔ tsi si le eme la dometɔ aɖewo ƒo ɖe afima hã.
I know something you don’t.	Menya nane si wò hã mènya o.
We had nothing in common.	Naneke menɔ mía dome si sɔ kple mía nɔewo o.
It’s just the truth.	Nyateƒea koe.
Spent a very long time with it.	Zã ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ ɖe eŋu.
And when things go wrong.	Eye ne nuwo gblẽ la.
But you also can’t cope without me.	Gake wò hã màte ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu nye manɔmee o.
This new thread is strong.	Ka yeye sia sesẽ.
He lost his home.	Eƒe aƒe bu nɛ.
Awesome.	Nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
It just worked.	Ðeko wòwɔ dɔ.
But always something will come up.	Gake ɣesiaɣi la, nane ado mo ɖa.
I'm sure he didn't.	Meka ɖe edzi be mewɔe nenema o.
I told him it was a good job.	Megblɔ nɛ be dɔ nyui aɖee.
Eventually, it will arrive.	Mlɔeba la, ava ɖo.
Or because of you.	Alo le wò ta.
The one who makes the promise.	Ame si doa ŋugbe.
Not that one either.	Menye ɖeka ma hã o.
I definitely know that.	Menya ema godoo.
And everyone left.	Eye amesiame dzo.
It’s your normal space.	Enye wò teƒe si sɔ.
Just ready for a normal life.	Ðeko wòle klalo na agbe si sɔ.
To some extent.	Va ɖo afi aɖe.
He would never do it.	Mawɔe gbeɖe o.
I need a booze.	Mehiã aha sesẽ.
None of them did anything.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ naneke o.
Here we have a very different situation.	Le afisia la, nɔnɔme si to vovo kura le mía ŋu.
It’s a very simple idea.	Enye susu bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔ.
Take the thing.	Tsɔ nu la.
Tell them they are doing a good job.	Gblɔ na wo be wole dɔ nyui aɖe wɔm.
There is no other.	Bubu aɖeke meli o.
I’m twice that age now, and so is he.	Mexɔ ƒe ma ƒe teƒe eve fifia, eye eya hã le nenema.
This thing isn’t giving me any joy either.	Nu sia hã mele dzidzɔ aɖeke nam o.
But he couldn’t say that.	Gake mete ŋu gblɔ nya ma o.
I don’t want to explain this.	Nyemedi be maɖe nya sia me o.
It's smaller here.	Ele sue wu le afisia.
Way too many ways.	Mɔ geɖe akpa.
But it surprised him.	Gake ewɔ nuku nɛ.
I'm here.	Meva le mo.
Something is not right here.	Nane mele nyuie le afisia o.
He doesn’t make many mental mistakes.	Mewɔa susu me vodada geɖe o.
It cannot live without water.	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe tsi manɔmee o.
To my surprise, everything turned out so well.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ be nusianu va nyo ŋutɔ.
That sounds reasonable.	Ema ɖi nya si sɔ.
But today is different.	Gake egbea ya to vovo.
He worked hard.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe.
In recent years, the death toll has increased dramatically.	Le ƒe ʋɛ siwo va yi me la, ame siwo ku la dzi ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
That you are not on his side.	Be mèle eƒe akpa dzi o.
And it went on and on.	Eye edzi yi edzi.
Much more like it used to be.	Nu geɖe wu abe alesi wònɔ tsã ene.
But there was water in it.	Gake tsi nɔ eme.
There is a good reason for it.	Susu nyui aɖe li si tae.
That was never a problem.	Ema menye kuxi gbeɖe o.
I just think how it is.	Ðeko mesusu be alesi wòle.
Now he gave her that eye.	Fifia etsɔ ŋku ma nɛ.
And so it is.	Eye nenema ke.
Just like your name is.	Abe alesi wò ŋkɔ nye ene.
This is very appropriate.	Esia sɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
On the day in question.	Le ŋkeke si ŋu nya ku ɖo dzi.
Many people will lose their jobs.	Dɔ ge le ame geɖe si.
Say a month.	Gblɔ be ɣleti ɖeka.
Everything has its time.	Nusianu kple eƒe ɣeyiɣi.
Actually, it never was.	Le nyateƒe me la, menɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
Doing so would have shortened the work.	Esia wɔwɔ ana dɔa nanɔ kpuie hafi.
I think it could happen.	Mesusu be ate ŋu adzɔ.
This?	Nu sia?
There was very little in it.	Nu sue aɖe koe nɔ eme.
Everything seemed normal.	Edze abe nusianu sɔ ene.
Some things just take time.	Ðeko nu aɖewo xɔa ɣeyiɣi.
We can kill them.	Míate ŋu awu wo.
Yet it is important.	Ke hã ele vevie.
Once you find them, do the work.	Ne ènya ke ɖe wo ŋu ko la, wɔ dɔa.
It has to be planned.	Ele be woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
And neither did anyone else.	Eye ame bubu aɖeke hã mewɔe nenema o.
One big problem.	Kuxi gã ɖeka.
There are many possibilities.	Nu geɖe li siwo ate ŋu adzɔ.
These reasons are important to me.	Susu siawo le vevie nam.
It was very pleasant to him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
Think he can cope.	Bu eŋu kpɔ be ate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu.
I don’t know what to tell you or do.	Nyemenya nu si magblɔ na wò alo mawɔ o.
He has a little one to deal with.	Vi aɖe le esi wòawɔ nu kplii.
It was a very small thing.	Enye nu sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
That means he is alive.	Ema fia be ele agbe.
Return to normal position.	Trɔ yi nɔnɔme si sɔ me.
It is very important for the job.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ na dɔa wɔwɔ.
Give your help.	Na wò kpekpeɖeŋu.
Nice to meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò.
However, many are more advanced.	Ke hã, ame geɖe de ŋgɔ wu.
I don’t need to explain that to you.	Mehiã be maɖe nya ma me na wò o.
Get up in your position.	Tso ɖe teƒe si nèle.
I have a lot of houses.	Aƒe geɖe le asinye.
His work is always the same.	Eƒe dɔa nɔa ɖeka ɣesiaɣi.
It won’t be like that.	Manɔ nenema o.
This is not unreasonable.	Esia menye nusi me susu mele o.
But no one should be here.	Gake mele be ame aɖeke nanɔ afisia o.
Could anyone do that.	Ðe ame aɖe ate ŋu awɔe nenema.
People were angry with him for doing that.	Amewo do dziku ɖe eŋu le esi wòwɔ nu nenema ta.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Nyemenya nusi le edzi yim o.
This may be appropriate.	Esia ate ŋu anye esi sɔ.
I want my good name and reputation.	Medi be nye ŋkɔ nyui kple ŋkɔ nyui nanɔ asinye.
You can imagine how much work that was.	Àte ŋu akpɔ dɔ si gbegbe nye ema le susu me.
Think about who came there.	Bu amesi va afima ŋu kpɔ.
There are many possible outcomes.	Nu geɖe li siwo ate ŋu ado tso eme.
Stick that inside.	Tsɔ nya ma ƒo ɖe eme.
They will be relatively easy to reach.	Wo gbɔ ɖoɖo anɔ bɔbɔe vie.
Maybe someone will answer this, who knows?.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe aɖo nya sia ŋu, amekae nya?.
This will improve performance on some devices.	Esia ana woawɔ dɔ nyuie wu le mɔ̃ aɖewo dzi.
Please find a suitable location.	Taflatse di teƒe si sɔ.
Every single year.	Ƒe ɖeka ɖesiaɖe.
Help is on the way.	Kpekpeɖeŋu le mɔ dzi.
They all cost the same price.	Wo katã ƒe asi ɖeka.
I tried to speak up.	Medze agbagba be maƒo nu.
It is very important to him.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ nɛ.
There has to be a better word.	Ele be nya si nyo wu nanɔ anyi.
He doesn't know himself these days.	Menya eɖokui le ŋkeke siawo me o.
There is no problem with this.	Kuxi aɖeke mele esia ŋu o.
He had never heard of any of me.	Mese nye dometɔ aɖeke ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
From there, you will have nothing.	Tso afi ma la, naneke manɔ asiwò o.
He lost something he could never get back.	Nane si mate ŋu axɔ gbeɖe o la bu nɛ.
He will protect us.	Akpɔ mía ta.
All or nothing at all.	Wo katã alo naneke kura o.
He did not treat any of us well.	Mewɔ nu ɖe ​​mía dometɔ aɖeke ŋu nyuie o.
It may be that way.	Ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
Interestingly, no one cares.	Nusi doa dzidzɔ nɛ la, ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
He has something we don’t have, he has the word.	Nane le esi si mele mía si o, nya la le esi.
We are here now.	Míele afisia fifia.
He didn’t recognize anyone.	Mekpɔ ame aɖeke dze sii o.
I wanted to share these new ideas with him.	Medi be magblɔ susu yeye siawo nɛ.
There is no money.	Ga aɖeke meli o.
You have to work to earn money.	Ele be nàwɔ dɔ hafi akpɔ ga.
But it seems too obvious.	Gake edze abe edze ƒã akpa ene.
Everything went well for me.	Nusianu va yi nyuie nam.
Thanks again, for everything.	Akpe na mi ake, ɖe nusianu ta.
I recognized them.	Mekpɔ wo dze sii.
I am ready now.	Mele klalo fifia.
Work is in progress.	Dɔ le edzi yim.
Please help me out.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye mado go.
My stuff is good enough to get rid of.	Nye nuwo nyo ale gbegbe be mate ŋu aɖe wo ɖa.
He just sat there.	Ðeko wònɔ anyi ɖe afima.
I have never liked waste.	Gbegblẽ nu medze ŋunye kpɔ o.
You have to be more consistent.	Ele be nàwɔ nu ɖekae wu.
This was very appealing to him.	Esia dze eŋu ŋutɔ.
I can’t do one job.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ dɔ ɖeka o.
And there is a reason.	Eye susu aɖe hã li.
Let me know what you think about it now.	Na manya nusi nèsusu tso eŋu azɔ.
He didn’t say that.	Megblɔ nya ma o.
This makes sense to me.	Susu le nya sia me nam.
The loss of life affected them.	Agbe si bu la gblẽ nu le wo ŋu.
Maybe you’re just a little thing.	Ðewohĩ ènye nu sue aɖe ko.
I was angry about that.	Medo dziku le nya ma ta.
Until last night.	Vaseɖe zã si va yi me.
I told you this.	Megblɔ nya sia na wò.
Many people are unaware of this.	Ame geɖe menya nu tso nya sia ŋu o.
They’re just being beaten.	Ðeko wole wo ƒom.
I needed to speak up.	Ehiã be maƒo nu.
He didn’t have room to do this.	Xɔ menɔ esi wòawɔ esia o.
Which is very good.	Nusi nyo ŋutɔ.
Which is too long.	Nusi didi akpa.
You can’t answer this question.	Màte ŋu aɖo nya sia ŋu o.
I think it might help you.	Mesusu be ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
It’s a mess.	Enye gbegblẽ.
There was one life before and one life after.	Agbe ɖeka nɔ anyi do ŋgɔ eye agbe ɖeka nɔ anyi le ema megbe.
As of right now, it doesn’t work.	Le fifia nu la, mewɔa dɔ o.
He got nowhere with that.	Meɖo afi aɖeke kple nya ma o.
We can’t accept this.	Míate ŋu axɔ esia o.
I hope we can do it next year.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be míate ŋu awɔe le ƒe si gbɔna me.
He didn’t understand any better.	Mese egɔme nyuie wu o.
Drive the car carefully.	Ʋu ʋua nyuie.
You are not one of them.	Menye wo dometɔ ɖekae nènye o.
Anyone can beat anyone on any given day.	Amesiame ate ŋu aƒo ame sia ame le ŋkeke ɖesiaɖe dzi.
What have you done with your life?.	Nukae nèwɔ kple wò agbe?.
And look where they are today.	Eye kpɔ afisi wole egbea ɖa.
And he was ready.	Eye wònɔ klalo.
There is nothing wrong with them.	Naneke mele wo ŋu o.
Leave this to me.	Gblẽ esia ɖe asinye.
A little more serious than that.	Vevie vie wu ema.
Another simple one too.	Bubu si le bɔbɔe hã.
Why is everyone making such a big deal about it?.	Nukatae amesiame le nya gã aɖe wɔm le eŋu?.
He can't do anything about how it is.	Mate ŋu awɔ naneke le alesi wòle ŋu o.
It was a good time to be there.	Enye ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe si me menɔ afima.
It doesn’t seem to matter anymore.	Edze abe megale vevie o ene.
There was no book.	Agbalẽ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
And how close that is to the truth.	Eye aleke gbegbe ema te ɖe nyateƒea ŋui enye si.
It seems pretty clear.	Edze abe eme kɔ nyuie ene.
I just wish there was someone else.	Ðeko medi be ame bubu aɖe nanɔ anyi.
The sweat poured down his face.	Fifia la kɔ ɖe eƒe mo.
And we didn’t know them beforehand.	Eye míenya wo do ŋgɔ o.
Everything is a bit overwhelming.	Nusianu xɔ aƒe ɖe ame me vie.
I don’t understand what I should go for now.	Nyemese nusi wòle be mayi gɔme fifia o.
People are against each other.	Amewo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
What do we know about these people?	Nukae míenya tso ame siawo ŋu?
We don’t have to do anything tonight.	Mehiã be míawɔ naneke le zã sia me o.
Maybe for himself.	Ðewohĩ na eya ŋutɔ.
I'll call you in the morning.	Maƒo ka na wò le ŋdi me.
That would work just as well.	Ema hã awɔ dɔ nenema ke.
I know my job.	Menya nye dɔ.
Someone raised his head.	Ame aɖe kɔ ta dzi.
The building is broken.	Xɔa me gblẽ.
It looked good to me.	Edze nyuie nam.
Almost everything was working against him.	Nusianu kloe nɔ dɔ wɔm ɖe eŋu.
I had this same issue.	Nya sia ke nɔ ŋunye.
It may never be the same.	Ðewohĩ manɔ abe tsã ene gbeɖe o.
He had a charm.	Nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame aɖe nɔ esi.
This house demands.	Aƒe sia bia tso ame si.
Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.	Edze abe amesiame nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm ene.
There just wasn’t time for that.	Ðeko ɣeyiɣi menɔ anyi na ema o.
That’s definitely what impressed me.	Emae nye nusi wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye godoo.
There was a man in it.	Ŋutsu aɖe nɔ eme.
Someone will do this for you.	Ame aɖe awɔ esia na wò.
Do that a lot.	Wɔ ema geɖe ŋutɔ.
Please help me on this one.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye le esia dzi.
I have to do it.	Ele be mawɔe.
It’s as simple as that.	Ele bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
I wonder where he is now.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be afikae wòle fifia hã.
Like, the whole town takes your word for it.	Abe, du bliboa xɔa wò nya la le eŋu ene.
Food prices have gone up dramatically.	Nuɖuɖu ƒe asi yi dzi ŋutɔ.
I can’t see them.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wo o.
Give them a little time.	Na ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe wo.
I'm too old now, anyway.	Metsi akpa fifia, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
It’s just in a different form.	Ðeko wòle nɔnɔme bubu me.
Nothing seemed to matter much.	Edze abe naneke mele vevie boo o ene.
He's doing what he's supposed to be doing.	Ele nusi wòle be wòawɔ la wɔm.
It will last for months.	Anɔ anyi ɣleti geɖe.
You will be very happy.	Dzi adzɔ wò ŋutɔ.
Its been a long time.	Eƒe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
You have nothing good to say about anything.	Nya nyui aɖeke mele asiwò nàgblɔ tso naneke ŋu o.
However, there is no one there.	Ke hã, ame aɖeke mele afima o.
There won’t be much work to do.	Dɔ geɖe manɔ anyi woawɔ o.
I have heard his voice at night.	Mese eƒe gbe le zã me kpɔ.
That was very bad.	Ema gblẽ nu ŋutɔ.
Any reason, please.	Susu ɖesiaɖe si tae, taflatse.
Everyone talks about it and no one does anything about it.	Amesiame ƒoa nu tso eŋu eye ame aɖeke mewɔa naneke tso eŋu o.
Some of them are obvious.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo dze ƒã.
It was what he was looking for.	Enye nusi dim wònɔ.
And it will be so.	Eye anɔ nenema.
It felt so good to me.	Ewɔ nam ŋutɔ.
I know it’s weird but it’s true.	Menya be ewɔ nuku gake enye nyateƒe.
I stepped inside.	Meɖe afɔ ɖe eme.
He may never say what is in his heart.	Ðewohĩ magblɔ nya si le eƒe dzi me gbeɖe o.
So hard, so hard.	Sesẽ ale gbegbe, sesĩe ale gbegbe.
That everything is more beautiful.	Be nusianu nya kpɔ wu.
The little car works well.	Ʋu sue la wɔa dɔ nyuie.
In fact, anger can be very good.	Le nyateƒe me la, dziku ate ŋu anyo ŋutɔ.
It is a lot of things.	Enye nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
Everyone knows someone.	Amesiame nya ame aɖe.
Nothing else worked.	Nu bubu aɖeke mewɔ dɔ o.
You’re attracted to him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi na wò.
I wasn’t sure how to characterize him.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi mawɔ eƒe nɔnɔme dzi o.
Maybe more than once.	Ðewohĩ wu zi ɖeka.
Maybe you’ll be interested.	Ðewohĩ adzɔ dzi na wò.
Nor did he want to have one.	Eye medi hã be ɖeke nanɔ ye si o.
Everyone went home happy.	Amesiame yi aƒeme kple dzidzɔ.
Only the wind passed through.	Ya koe to eme.
This is very annoying.	Esia do dziku ŋutɔ.
If not further than that.	Ne menye ɖe ŋgɔ wu ema o la.
I don’t really want to know.	Nyemedi be manya ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He was obviously depressed.	Edze ƒã be nu te ɖe edzi.
It could be years.	Ate ŋu anye ƒe geɖe.
Each showed his dignity.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ɖe eƒe bubu fia.
But it is so.	Gake ele nenema.
Or do any work.	Alo wɔ dɔ ɖe sia ɖe.
But there must be another way.	Gake ele be mɔ bubu aɖe nanɔ anyi.
He seems very angry.	Edze abe dziku le eme ŋutɔ ene.
He worked on this for years.	Ewɔ dɔ tso esia ŋu ƒe geɖe.
One day is a thousand years.	Ŋkeke ɖeka nye ƒe akpe ɖeka.
This is a real situation for me.	Esia nye nɔnɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ nam.
None of it seems real.	Edze abe wo dometɔ aɖeke nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o ene.
It will take a few hours.	Axɔ gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo.
And we are like that.	Eye míenye nenema.
He was very attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
We are not happy.	Míele dzidzɔ kpɔm o.
He fled the scene.	Esi dzo.
Maybe he will do that.	Ðewohĩ awɔe nenema.
But tomorrow it will be.	Gake etsɔ la, anɔ nenema.
Hard.	Sesẽ.
This is very appropriate.	Esia sɔ ŋutɔ.
He has been there for many years.	Ele afima ƒe geɖe.
But tell us about it.	Gake gblɔ nu tso eŋu na mí.
I don’t have anything.	Naneke mele asinye o.
There is a lot of space in it.	Teƒe geɖe le eme.
No wonder he looked tired.	Mewɔ nuku o be edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ene.
Let me be convinced!	Na meka ɖe edzi!
He can’t do anything.	Mate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
It could be for any reason.	Ate ŋu anye susu ɖesiaɖe tae.
They will just make you one.	Ðeko woawɔ wò ɖeka.
To say.	Ku ku.
He was obviously tired too.	Edze ƒã be ɖeɖi te eya hã ŋu.
I still don’t understand them.	Nyemese wo gɔme haɖe o.
It’s really amazing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He is no longer here.	Megale afisia o.
We only knew each other for a few days.	Ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe míenya mía nɔewo.
It’s a case of a loser.	Enye ame aɖe si bu ƒe nya.
I would like to stay .	Madi be manɔ anyi .
It is active and fast.	Ele dɔ dzi eye wòle du dzi.
This is not necessarily true.	Esia menye nyateƒe kokoko o.
You can’t do that.	Màte ŋu awɔe nenema o.
We are looking for people to work here.	Míele amewo dim be woawɔ dɔ le afisia.
He'll let himself go wrong, that's clear.	Aɖe asi le eɖokui ŋu wòawɔ nu gbegblẽ, esia me kɔ.
I need to talk to him now.	Ele be maƒo nu kplii fifia.
It won’t last all year.	Manɔ anyi ƒe bliboa o.
Everything is clear.	Nusianu me kɔ.
It’s something really different.	Enye nusi to vovo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Like this house.	Abe aƒe sia ene.
None of them came close to him.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mete ɖe eŋu o.
If it’s somewhere in there, it needs a plan.	Ne ele afi aɖe le eme la, ehiã ɖoɖo aɖe.
I never wanted to do this.	Nyemedi gbeɖe be mawɔ esia o.
But he will live.	Gake anɔ agbe.
He sang to me.	Edzi ha nam.
Now you have a problem.	Fifia kuxi aɖe le ŋuwò.
I'm at home.	Mele aƒeme.
And that’s not just one thing.	Eye menye nu ɖeka koe nye ema o.
Go to an empty house.	Yi aƒe si me ame aɖeke mele o me.
No one knew what to do.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi wòawɔ o.
This is important to me, kid.	Esia le vevie nam, ɖevi.
It can bleed.	Ate ŋu aƒo ʋu.
I still had work to do.	Dɔ gakpɔtɔ nɔ asinye mawɔ.
He never raised his voice with her.	Medo gbe ɖe dzi kplii kpɔ o.
Keep your tongue.	Dzɔ wò aɖe dzi.
I know this applies to me.	Menya be esia ku ɖe ŋunye.
But it doesn’t matter.	Gake mele vevie o.
He is one of us.	Mía dometɔ ɖekae wònye.
There is too much going on.	Nu geɖe akpa le edzi yim.
He likes where he is now.	Afisi wòle fifia la dze eŋu ŋutɔ.
But there is only one.	Gake ɖeka koe.
I really enjoy that.	Ema dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Probably, after all these years, not possible.	Ðewohĩ, le ƒe siawo katã megbe la, manya wɔ o.
There are many places.	Teƒe geɖe le afima.
It’s a summer one.	Enye dzomeŋɔli me tɔ.
That would bother him.	Ema aɖe fu nɛ.
Just.	Ko.
People are working on that.	Amewo le dɔ wɔm tso ema ŋu.
He had no words.	Nya aɖeke menɔ esi o.
Write down what you want.	Ŋlɔ nu si nèdi la ɖi.
I think you might like it.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ adzɔ dzi na wò.
This is an extreme case.	Esia nye nusi gbɔ eme.
I'll see you next week.	Makpɔ wò le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me.
I needed so many things.	Mehiã nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
He didn’t care about me.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam o.
But let’s try something a little more involved.	Gake mina míate nane si ku ɖe eme vie la kpɔ.
There was something .	Nane nɔ anyi .
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Naneke mate ŋu anɔ ŋgɔ wu nyateƒea o.
It was very pleasant to him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
He seemed to be calling me.	Edze abe ɖe wònɔ ka ƒom nam ene.
A very good idea.	Susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
In my room.	Le nye xɔ me.
The air is hot.	Ya la xɔ dzo.
Not with us at our place.	Menye kple mí le mía gbɔ o.
How did you get to that point?	Aleke nèwɔ va ɖo nɔnɔme ma me?
I think that explains something.	Mesusu be ema ɖe nane me.
However, there is one small problem.	Ke hã, kuxi sue ɖeka aɖe li.
Attach.	Lé ɖe eŋu.
But look at you.	Gake kpɔ wò ɖa.
Probably any time of any day.	Ðewohĩ ŋkeke ɖesiaɖe ƒe ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe.
Death is just not what it used to be.	Ðeko ku mele abe alesi wònɔ tsã ene o.
What he lacks is challenge.	Nusi mehiã nɛ o enye kuxi.
We were very excited.	Dzi dzɔ mí ŋutɔ.
But one doesn’t have to dwell on that for long.	Gake mehiã be ame nanɔ ema dzi ɣeyiɣi didi o.
Always, always, always.	Ɣesiaɣi, ɣesiaɣi, ɣesiaɣi.
Not a long time ago.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia o.
I have a strong voice.	Gbe sesẽ aɖe le asinye.
I don’t know why.	Nyemenya nusi tae o.
I have no problem with that one.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ŋunye le ɖeka ma ŋu o.
This is not a pleasant situation.	Esia menye nɔnɔme si doa dzidzɔ na ame o.
Today it is not working.	Egbea mele dɔ wɔm o.
That felt important.	Ema se le eɖokui me be ele vevie.
No one knows where he is.	Ame aɖeke menya afi si wòle o.
That’s pretty clear now.	Ema me kɔ nyuie fifia.
I joined for a reason.	Susu aɖe tae meva kpe ɖe eŋu.
Here and there.	Afisia kple afima.
I will do anything for you.	Mawɔ nusianu na wò.
I just wanted to know if you were okay, kid.	Ðeko medi be manya nenye be èle nyuie, ɖevi.
I think you are one.	Mesusu be ènye ɖeka.
That makes perfect sense.	Susu le nya ma me kura.
Anger ran through him.	Dziku nɔ edzi yim to eme.
This is obviously very important.	Edze ƒã be esia le vevie ŋutɔ.
There was a kind.	Ƒomevi aɖe nɔ anyi.
Eyes similar to his own.	Ŋku siwo sɔ kple eya ŋutɔ tɔ.
Come on here.	Va le afisia.
It didn’t help him.	Meɖe vi aɖeke nɛ o.
He looked dead tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ku ene.
But maybe this is just as well.	Gake ɖewohĩ esia hã nyo nenema ke.
I had heard that name before.	Mese ŋkɔ ma do ŋgɔ.
The whole process was so easy.	Dɔ bliboa wɔwɔ nɔ bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
It’s one thing or another.	Enye nu ɖeka alo nu bubu.
If you have any questions, send them to me.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò la, ɖoe ɖem.
It probably doesn’t matter.	Anɔ eme be mehiã o.
This is certainly not a new issue.	Esia menye nya yeye aɖe o godoo.
I know exactly what you are going through.	Menya nu si me tom nèle la nyuie.
I felt like I was the only one.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye ɖeka koe nye ema.
The police asked me that question.	Kpovitɔwo bia nya ma nam.
the teacher asked.	nufiala la bia nya sia.
You have to have a job.	Ele be dɔ nanɔ asiwò.
Something had changed in his life.	Nane trɔ le eƒe agbe me.
I know you can see them too.	Menya be wò hã àte ŋu akpɔ wo.
I know what it’s like.	Menya alesi wòle.
Quite a great situation.	Nɔnɔme gã aɖe kura.
Think about what you did!	Bu nu si nèwɔ la ŋu kpɔ!
This is not an easy task.	Esia menye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖeke o.
If there is one that can, move in that direction.	Ne ɖeka li si ate ŋui la, ke ʋu ɖe mɔ ma nu.
Will go on a diet soon.	Ayi nuɖuɖu aɖe dzi kpuie.
It could be nothing.	Ate ŋu anye naneke o.
I am seeing someone.	Mele ame aɖe kpɔm.
Someone help or advise please.	Ame aɖe kpe ɖe eŋu alo aɖo aɖaŋu na wò taflatse.
There wasn’t any of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
He did some things on his own.	Ewɔ nu aɖewo le eɖokui si.
I said only a little.	Nya sue aɖe koe megblɔ.
In the morning.	Le ŋdi me.
Exactly what you want.	Nusi tututu nèdi.
He wasn't doing much better himself.	Eya ŋutɔ menɔ nu wɔm nyuie wu kura o.
From a car owner, that is.	Tso ʋu me tɔ gbɔ, si fia be.
I did it very well.	Mewɔe nyuie ŋutɔ.
His attention was quick.	Eƒe susu nɔ nu ŋu kaba.
That was a very sad thing for me.	Nya ma te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
It’s not that simple.	Menye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
The one person.	Ame ɖeka la.
People can walk through me.	Amewo ate ŋu azɔ to menye.
His first book.	Eƒe agbalẽ gbãtɔ.
We are just people.	Amewo koe míenye.
I’ve seen that myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mekpɔ ema kpɔ.
The summer is here.	Dzomeŋɔli ɖo.
I made a career out of it.	Mewɔ dɔ aɖe tso eme.
Some strong voices.	Gbe sesẽ aɖewo.
He is waiting for me.	Ele lalam nam.
Water.	Metsi.
Some people got the job.	Ame aɖewo xɔ dɔa.
But there is a truth.	Gake nyateƒe aɖe li.
So far, fine.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nyuie.
No problem with any situation.	Kuxi aɖeke mele nɔnɔme aɖeke ŋu o.
No one seemed to know what was going on.	Edze abe ame aɖeke menya nusi le edzi yim o ene.
It can be anything you want.	Ate ŋu anye nusianu si nèdi.
The same results were obtained in our work.	Nu ma ke do tso eme le míaƒe dɔa hã me.
At the time in question.	Le ɣeyiɣi si ŋu nya ku ɖo me.
Things that stay with you.	Nu siwo nɔa ŋuwò.
Every great person left.	Ame gã ɖesiaɖe dzo.
I have one side, I have one tooth.	Akpa ɖeka le asinye, aɖu ɖeka le asinye.
He didn’t feel, understand, or care.	Mese le eɖokui me o, mese egɔme o, alo metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
There are better jobs.	Dɔ siwo nyo wu li.
I took care of the house.	Mekpɔ aƒea gbɔ.
We have a big heart.	Dzi gã aɖe le mía si.
But it is so.	Gake ele nenema.
Or just me.	Alo nye koe.
I can’t remember how much.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku alesi gbegbe dzi o.
You’re the first one here.	Wòe nye ame gbãtɔ si le afisia.
In fact, you can get much more than that.	Le nyateƒe me la, àte ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe wu ema.
Because of this, you can do a lot.	Le esia ta la, àte ŋu awɔ nu geɖe.
People are having fun here.	Amewo le dzidzɔ kpɔm le afisia.
It worked out well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
Her heart felt strange.	Eƒe dzi se le eɖokui me be ewɔ nuku.
Time also stood still.	Ɣeyiɣi hã tɔ ɖe eŋu.
The first point.	Nya gbãtɔ.
I had to find something.	Ele be makpɔ nane.
He can easily prove it.	Ate ŋu aɖo kpe edzi bɔbɔe.
But, there seems to be a problem.	Gake, edze abe kuxi aɖe li ene.
The first day of school.	Suku ƒe ŋkeke gbãtɔ.
But you are a busy man.	Gake ènye ŋutsu si ŋu vovo mele o.
He stayed there only a few months.	Ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo koe wònɔ afima.
Not of the thing itself.	Menye nu la ŋutɔ tɔ o.
I had a late night.	Mekpɔ zã si tsi megbe.
It has done me a lot of good.	Ewɔ nyui geɖe nam.
But this is also important.	Gake esia hã le vevie.
Come, come inside.	Va, va ge ɖe eme.
The whole thing is bad on every side.	Nu bliboa gblẽ le akpa sia akpa.
But it doesn’t explain everything.	Gake meɖe nusianu me o.
There has to be a problem.	Ele be kuxi aɖe nanɔ anyi.
He may have very little.	Ðewohĩ nu sue aɖe koe anɔ esi.
I can’t ‘say anything.	Nyemate ŋu ‘agblɔ nya aɖeke o.
But some people are not so enthusiastic.	Gake dzo mele ame aɖewo me nenema gbegbe o.
Focus on that.	Lé fɔ ɖe ema ŋu.
So was my hair.	Nenema ke nye ɖa hã nɔ.
Let me do it.	Mina mawɔe.
I thought that was beautiful.	Mesusu be ema nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
It was a very strange statement.	Enye nya aɖe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
And maybe we can get to them.	Eye ɖewohĩ míate ŋu aɖo wo gbɔ.
Everyone knows everyone’s job here, too.	Amesiame nya amesiame ƒe dɔ le afisia, hã.
I enjoy this work.	Dɔ sia dzɔa dzi nam.
The building was badly damaged by fire.	Dzo gblẽ nu le xɔa ŋu vevie.
Yet it is true.	Ke hã enye nyateƒe.
There was no way he could say that.	Mɔ aɖeke meli si dzi wòate ŋu agblɔ nya ma le o.
I tried once.	Mete kpɔ zi ɖeka.
We can help each other.	Míate ŋu akpe ɖe mía nɔewo ŋu.
It’s been a while.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
I found myself in that exact situation .	Mekpɔ ɖokuinye le nɔnɔme ma tututu me .
This book is outdated.	Agbalẽ sia do xoxo.
This is a very difficult task to do.	Esia nye dɔ sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ be woawɔ.
Face to dom.	Mele go dom.
He had plenty of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe nɔ esi.
We’re not giving you the money.	Míele ga la nam wò o.
We can keep doing that.	Míate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ nya ma wɔm.
Or in this case.	Alo le go sia me la.
His voice was only in my mind.	Nye susu me koe eƒe gbe nɔ.
It’s something we know how to do.	Enye nusi míenya alesi míawɔ.
There is one good thing about this situation though.	Nu nyui ɖeka aɖe le nɔnɔme sia me gake.
He couldn’t do anything else.	Mete ŋu wɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
So far, it's working.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ele dɔ wɔm.
Very little wind this morning.	Ya sue aɖe koe ƒo ŋdi sia.
It is that important.	Ele vevie nenema gbegbe.
He would have liked that.	Anye ne ema adzɔ dzi nɛ hafi.
But not today.	Gake menye egbea o.
Nothing is more important than that.	Naneke mele vevie wu ema o.
I can’t win with him.	Nyemate ŋu aɖu dzi kplii o.
I am fighting everything in me.	Mele avu wɔm kple nu sia nu si le menye.
He never really did that.	Mewɔe nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
Some of them have already fallen .	Wo dometɔ aɖewo dze anyi xoxo .
They lost that opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ ma bu na wo.
I wasn’t talking to you.	Menye ɖe menɔ nu ƒom na wò o.
Any of our types will work.	Míaƒe ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe awɔ dɔ.
A long, long time ago.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
Which is enough for us.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ na mí.
Not that there was nothing he could do about it.	Menye ɖe naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu o.
Always at all.	Ɣesiaɣi kura.
I am not going to tell you anything about it.	Nyemele nya aɖeke gblɔ ge na mi tso eŋu o.
He knows nothing about his life now.	Menya naneke tso eƒe agbe ŋu fifia o.
Again, this is true.	Le afisia hã la, esia nye nyateƒe.
It was my first mistake.	Enye nye vodada gbãtɔ.
It will be a beautiful one.	Anye esi nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
I thought it was impossible.	Mesusu be manya wɔ o.
Or something else, something simpler.	Alo nu bubu aɖe, nane si le bɔbɔe wu.
That’s a lot of it.	Ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t think of it.	Nyemete ŋu bu eŋu o.
They are definitely there.	Wole afima godoo.
There might be one long before that.	Ðewohĩ ɖeka anɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe do ŋgɔ na ema.
I know what’s good now.	Menya nusi nyo fifia.
But not my people.	Gake menye nye amewo o.
We have a very strong voice now.	Gbe sesẽ ŋutɔ aɖe le mía si fifia.
It can’t be true.	Mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
This would be a great place to work.	Esia anye teƒe nyui aɖe si woawɔ dɔ le.
I don't really know how to do this though.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ esia ŋutɔŋutɔ o ke hã.
It doesn’t do anything for me.	Mewɔa naneke nam o.
But that was about him.	Gake nya ma ku ɖe eŋu.
Once you are ready to work.	Ne èle klalo be yeawɔ dɔ ko.
He couldn’t stay here long.	Mete ŋu nɔ afisia eteƒe didi o.
They seem to be fine.	Edze abe wole nyuie ene.
He didn’t want me to do it.	Medi be mawɔe o.
I do my own thing.	Nye ŋutɔ mewɔa nye dɔ.
Now, promise me that.	Azɔ, do ŋugbe nam nenema.
If you have a question, send it.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò la, ɖoe ɖa.
It certainly seems possible.	Edze abe anya wɔ ene godoo.
There is nothing about them anywhere.	Naneke mele wo ŋu le afi aɖeke o.
We can’t go tonight, or tomorrow.	Míate ŋu ayi zã sia me, alo etsɔ o.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
We have to fight them.	Ele be míawɔ avu kpli wo.
My life is over.	Nye agbe wu enu.
Like many of them too.	Abe wo dometɔ geɖe hã ene.
Build a house.	Tu aƒe aɖe.
He can only do what he has to do.	Ðeko wòate ŋu awɔ nusi wòle be wòawɔ.
I saw you behind the back.	Mekpɔ wò le megbe la megbe.
He was very, very interested.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme vevie ŋutɔ.
This is your fault.	Esia nye wò vodada.
He can figure out what to do about it.	Ate ŋu akpɔ nusi wòawɔ tso eŋu.
He seemed like a nice guy.	Edze abe ŋutsu nyui aɖee wònye ene.
And that’s a good point.	Eye nya nyui aɖee nye ema.
I don’t want to bother you.	Nyemedi be maɖe fu na wò o.
I barely survived.	Ðeko metsi agbe vie ko.
I put this aside last year.	Meɖe esia ɖe vovo le ƒe si va yi me.
I can play that role.	Mate ŋu awɔ akpa ma.
I know you can’t have everything.	Menya be màte ŋu akpɔ nusianu o.
Everyone hates this guy.	Amesiame lé fu ŋutsu sia.
I decided to act at once.	Meɖoe be mawɔ nu zi ɖeka.
He has a strong face.	Mo sesẽ aɖe le eŋu.
And it doesn’t matter.	Eye mehiã o.
I know the past few weeks haven’t been easy for you.	Menya be kwasiɖa siwo va yi la menɔ bɔbɔe na wò o.
One more day.	Gbe ɖeka bubu.
The result was amazing.	Nusi do tso eme wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This is not a house.	Esia menye aƒe o.
Come on, go out.	Va, do go.
I just stood there.	Ðeko metsi tre ɖe afima.
I hope someone can help you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
Everyone does this.	Amewo katã wɔa esia.
I have never seen this in my life.	Nyemekpɔ esia le nye agbe me kpɔ o.
I couldn’t help myself.	Nyemete ŋu lé ɖokuinye nu o.
Remove the salted water.	Ðe tsi si me dze le la ɖa.
Anyone can get any of them.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu axɔ wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
This is a serious mistake.	Esia nye vodada gã aɖe.
But on its own, it can go no further.	Gake le eɖokui si la, mate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu ema o.
I heard that, too.	Mese nya ma hã.
About you and me.	Le mía kple wò ŋu.
He just didn’t know.	Ðeko menya o.
All in search of that other thing.	Wo katã le nu bubu ma didi me.
He had never felt anything.	Mese naneke le eɖokui me kpɔ o.
Yet he didn’t want to go.	Ke hã medi be yeayi o.
Turn to them quickly.	Trɔ ɖe wo ŋu kaba.
It may be true.	Ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
This is very good for them.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ na wo.
We don’t really know what happened.	Míenya nusi dzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I don’t understand that.	Nyemese nya ma gɔme o.
I'm ready to just meet with them.	Mele klalo be mado go kpli wo ko.
I had a house there.	Aƒe aɖe nɔ asinye le afima.
A man no one really knew.	Ŋutsu si ame aɖeke menya ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Not an exception to this case.	Menye nusi to vovo na nya sia o.
and you can find them easily enough.	eye àte ŋu akpɔ wo bɔbɔe alesi dze.
I don’t want to see anyone.	Nyemedi be makpɔ ame aɖeke o.
There will be no additional cost.	Ga bubu aɖeke manɔ eme o.
The search was unsuccessful.	Didi la medze edzi o.
He was a very stable person.	Enye amesi nɔ anyi sesĩe ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t go any further.	Mete ŋu yi ŋgɔ wu ema o.
There is nothing in it.	Nu aɖeke mele eme o.
Let me speak.	Mina maƒo nu.
Or apparently never came out.	Alo edze abe medo go gbeɖe o ene.
Let’s make some music!.	Mina míawɔ ha aɖewo!.
Thanks for organizing!.	Akpe na wò be nèwɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu!.
He was just like a child.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖevi ene.

He will fight it.	Awɔ avu kplii.
There is a good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe li.
More likely, actually.	Anɔ eme wu be, le nyateƒe me.
We can’t be relaxed.	Míate ŋu aɖe dzi ɖi o.
This will be your room.	Esia anye wò xɔ.
Like the type type.	Abe ƒomevi ƒomevi la ene.
His attitude toward school improved.	Eƒe nɔnɔme le suku ŋu va nyo ɖe edzi.
That’s encouraging.	Ema de dzi ƒo na ame.
But there was no time for that.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi na ema o.
Waste of time.	Ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
We had no water.	Tsi aɖeke menɔ mía si o.
I'd better go now.	Anyo be mayi fifia.
Other than that, it was just another day.	Ne menye ema o la, ŋkeke bubu aɖe koe wònye.
I couldn’t see clearly.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nu nyuie o.

He was a good guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖee wònye.

Not quite four hours.	Menye gaƒoƒo ene tututu o.
Last year was a great year.	Ƒe si va yi nye ƒe gã aɖe ŋutɔ.

I need to do more.	Ele be mawɔ geɖe wu.
But it could have been anyone.	Gake ate ŋu anye amesiame hafi.
His mouth opened.	Eƒe nu ʋu.
It is a common knowledge.	Enye nusi ame geɖe nya.
I got out of that role.	Medo le akpa ma me.
He never answered.	Meɖo eŋu kpɔ o.
I was just like that.	Ðeko menɔ nenema.
Things got worse yesterday.	Nuwo va gblẽ ɖe edzi etsɔ.
I think it will help the meeting.	Mesusu be akpe ɖe kpekpea ŋu.
You are that person.	Wòe nye ame ma.
There is no easy task.	Dɔ bɔbɔe aɖeke meli o.
My whole life has changed now.	Nye agbe bliboa trɔ fifia.
My heart was racing.	Nye dzi nɔ du dzi sesĩe.
But take a closer look.	Gake lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie wu.
Only one should still be up.	Mele be ɖeka koe gakpɔtɔ le dzi.
And neither did he, for that matter.	Eye eya hã mewɔe nenema o, le nya ma ta.
I hope he lives to be a thousand.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be anɔ agbe anye akpe ɖeka.
Because of this, he lost everything.	Le esia ta la, nusianu bu nɛ.
It’s very clear.	Eme kɔ ŋutɔ.
I don’t know anything about this.	Nyemenya naneke tso nya sia ŋu o.
But that stopped, a long time ago.	Gake ema nu tso, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
If anyone can get us out of here, they can.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu aɖe mí le afisia la, ate ŋui.
That doesn’t matter.	Ema mehiã o.
But it was a great job.	Gake dɔ gã aɖee wònye.
I always liked her.	Eƒe nu dzɔa dzi nam ɣesiaɣi.
Or feel about something.	Alo se le eɖokui me le nane ŋu.
I will go home too.	Nye hã mayi aƒeme.
Some major projects have been delayed this year.	Dɔ gã aɖewo tsi megbe le ƒe sia me.
My hair is so long!	Nye ɖa didi ale gbegbe!
I had never seen that, before.	Nyemekpɔ ema kpɔ o, do ŋgɔ.
Do this once, well.	Wɔ esia zi ɖeka, nyuie.
It belongs here.	Enye afisia tɔ.
And nobody ever saw that.	Eye ame aɖeke mekpɔ ema kpɔ o.
That leg was just as bad.	Afɔ ma hã gblẽ nenema ke.
He had a gun.	Tu nɔ esi.
I don’t think I did that.	Nyemesusu be mewɔe nenema o.
That’s not a problem.	Ema menye kuxi o.
The car broke down.	Ʋua gblẽ.

But they had nothing in mind.	Gake naneke menɔ wo ŋu le susu me o.
I want to know about that someone.	Medi be manya nu tso ame aɖe ma ŋu.
I think everyone sees that.	Mesusu be amesiame kpɔa ema.
I would love to continue the work all through the night.	Adzɔ dzi nam be mayi dɔa dzi le zã bliboa me ke.
They were very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku na wo ŋutɔ.
There is nothing we can do with it.	Naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ kplii o.
I needed this.	Mehiã esia.
I think he would love it.	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
There was very little there.	Nu sue aɖe koe nɔ afima.
See ya changed one thing.	Kpɔ ya trɔ nu ɖeka.
This is surprising for several reasons.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ le susu geɖe ta.
The afternoon was very hot.	Ŋdɔ me xɔ dzo ŋutɔ.
That was a good day.	Ema nye ŋkeke nyui aɖe dzi.
Click on that water.	Zi tsi ma dzi.
You have freedom in your life.	Vovo le ŋuwò le wò agbe me.
I'm sure he wouldn't have made a mistake.	Meka ɖe edzi be anye ne mewɔ vodada o.
Here, people know us.	Le afisia la, amewo nya mí.
Again, no one answered.	Azɔ hã, ame aɖeke meɖo eŋu o.
This room looks like new.	Xɔ sia dze abe yeye ene.
He had never heard anything.	Mese naneke kpɔ o.
The way you want it.	Ale si nèdi.
That is true enough.	Ema nye nyateƒe si sɔ gbɔ.
You have to be honest about that.	Ele be nàwɔ nyateƒe le nya ma ŋu.
You are not yourself.	Menye wò ŋutɔ nènye o.
Add to this the fact that it is	Tsɔ nyateƒe si wònye be ele nenema kpe ɖe esia ŋu
It won’t be easy, trust me.	Manɔ bɔbɔe o, ka ɖe dzinye.
He didn’t care that much for me.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam nenema gbegbe o.
something else must have been going on.	nu bubu aɖe anya nɔ edzi yim.
There is something strange, wonderful about many parts.	Nane li si wɔ nuku, si wɔ nuku le akpa geɖe ŋu.
It’s something he hasn’t felt in a long time.	Enye nusi mese le eɖokui me o ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
Please take a look at it.	Taflatse lé ŋku ɖe eŋu.
Not for anything else.	Menye ɖe naneke ta o.
It will likely continue for years to come.	Anɔ eme be ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim ƒe geɖe.
No one could say what happened.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu gblɔ nusi dzɔ o.
This is life for this person so far.	Esia nye agbe na ame sia vaseɖe fifia.
There is so much to do.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li woawɔ.
Two is good, one is better.	Eve nyo, ɖeka nyo wu.
But there was a bit of a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖe nɔ anyi vie.
His face was still.	Eƒe mo nɔ anyi.
That just isn’t working, and it won’t work.	Ðeko ema mele dɔ wɔm o, eye mawɔ dɔ hã o.
He made his way out.	Ewɔ eƒe mɔ do go.
Maybe he can live up to them.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu anɔ agbe ɖe wo nu.
That is no small thing.	Ema menye nu sue aɖeke o.
He will tell you the same thing.	Agblɔ nya ma ke na wò.
There’s still a lot you don’t know.	Nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ li siwo mènya o.
It can’t end like this.	Mate ŋu awu enu alea o.
It is very much like that.	Ele nenema ŋutɔ.
I wonder how long he was there.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɣeyiɣi didi kae wònɔ afima hã.
I don’t know where he could be.	Nyemenya afi si wòate ŋu anɔ o.
In the end, it doesn’t really matter.	Mlɔeba la, mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I found a serious problem.	Mekpɔ kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
Please, get inside.	Meɖe kuku, ge ɖe eme.
He couldn't think about that now.	Mete ŋu bu nya ma ŋu fifia o.
More people speak this language than any other.	Ame geɖe doa gbe sia wu gbe bubu ɖesiaɖe.
I needed the job.	Mehiã dɔa.
Music has been playing in this room for hours.	Wole ha ƒom le xɔ sia me gaƒoƒo geɖe.
Finding these devices was a long process.	Mɔ̃ siawo didi nye dɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
The men of his town.	Ŋutsu siwo le eƒe du me.
I glanced at my own.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe nye ŋutɔ tɔ ŋu.
Hold on as long as you want.	Lé ɖe eŋu ɣeyiɣi didi si nèdi.
Not a downside, not by any means.	Menye nusi gblẽ le eŋu o, menye le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
For hours at night.	Zã me gaƒoƒo geɖe.
No one else understood.	Ame bubu aɖeke mese egɔme o.
That sounds a little weird, maybe.	Ema ɖi nusi wɔ nuku vie, ɖewohĩ.
That was important.	Ema nɔ vevie.
This is a difficult problem.	Esia nye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
I think it will happen soon.	Mesusu be ava eme kpuie.
Two men are in the car with him.	Ŋutsu eve le ʋua me kplii.
He could not explain their surprise.	Mate ŋu aɖe nusi wɔ nuku na wo alea la me o.
This will make your job much easier.	Esia ana wò dɔa nanɔ bɔbɔe na wò ŋutɔ.
You don’t know what happened to me.	Mènya nu si dzɔ ɖe dzinye o.
Nor is it anything in life.	Eye menye naneke le agbe me hã o.
It’s almost unnecessary.	Mehiã o kloe.
He had done so much.	Ewɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ kpɔ.
He had a good reputation.	Ŋkɔ nyui aɖe nɔ eŋu.
You don’t have any time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke mele asiwò o.
He never did and he never will.	Mewɔe kpɔ o eye mawɔe hã gbeɖe o.
Police have yet to determine the cause of death.	Kpovitɔwo mekpɔ nya nusi gbɔ ku tso haɖe o.
Maybe it’s here.	Ðewohĩ ele afisia.
But he only has a place for the job.	Gake teƒe aɖe koe le esi na dɔa wɔwɔ.
And look at it.	Eye kpɔ ɖa.
Start with a book or two.	Dze egɔme kple agbalẽ ɖeka alo eve.
He had never seen anything like it.	Mekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
This is definitely not the case.	Esia mele alea o godoo.
Everyone’s attitude matters.	Ame sia ame ƒe nɔnɔme le vevie.
There might be a new one out there.	Ðewohĩ yeye aɖe anɔ afima.
Not a lot of time.	Menye ɣeyiɣi geɖe o.
Everything is fine.	Nusianu le nyuie.
His death, several times.	Eƒe ku, zi geɖe.
But something got in the way.	Gake nane ge ɖe eme.
This was going to be difficult.	Esia nɔ sesẽ ge.
And yet.	Eye ke hã.
He has no reason.	Susu aɖeke mele esi o.
I don’t think anyone would mind.	Nyemesusu be ame aɖeke maɖe fu nɛ o.
Not as important though.	Menye abe alesi wòle vevie ene o ke hã.
I thought he would call.	Mesusu be aƒo ka.
I really can’t take this long.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi sia o.
That’s his character.	Emae nye eƒe nɔnɔme.
It’s either there or it’s not there.	Ele afima alo mele afima o.
That wouldn’t work.	Ema mawɔ dɔ o.
Let me work on it.	Mina mawɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
This is something new to me.	Esia nye nu yeye nam.
In fact, this is not true.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia menye nyateƒe o.
So much for that.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ ɖe ema ta.
It is as true as it was many years ago.	Enye nyateƒe abe alesi wònɔ ƒe geɖe enye sia ene.
Go away!	Dzo le afima!
It’s not exactly normal.	Menye nusi sɔ tututu o.
I think it will go.	Mesusu be ayi.
Now everything has changed.	Fifia nusianu trɔ.
Now listen here	Azɔ ɖo to le afisia
We seem to be a big deal here.	Edze abe míenye nu gã aɖe le afisia ene.
That’s what we’re here for.	Ema tae míele afisia ɖo.
I should never have told you that.	Mele be magblɔ nya ma na wò gbeɖe o.
We have one person in that house.	Ame ɖeka le mía si le aƒe ma me.
Maybe that’s closer to the truth.	Ðewohĩ ema te ɖe nyateƒea ŋu wu.
His life, our life.	Eƒe agbe, míaƒe agbe.
He didn’t know anything.	Menya naneke o.
A very small amount.	Susu sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
This is not supposed to be the case.	Menye ɖe wòle be esia nanɔ nenema o.
Everyone can make mistakes in life.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu awɔ vodada le agbe me.
Not sure if that is possible.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be ema anya wɔ o.
It worked, after a while.	Ewɔ dɔ, le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe.
But, it didn’t work.	Gake, mewɔ dɔ o.
Live with it.	Nɔ agbe kplii.
Which is very good.	Nusi nyo ŋutɔ.
Nothing does anything.	Naneke mewɔa naneke o.
This is really quite amazing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is actually not a good idea.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia menye susu nyui aɖeke o.
Everything else is a blur.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nye nusi me kɔ o.
This is relevant for two reasons.	Esia sɔ le susu eve aɖewo ta.
Not for a few days.	Menye ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe nye ema o.
Maybe it will benefit someone else.	Ðewohĩ aɖe vi na ame bubu.
I was there from day one.	Menɔ afima tso ŋkeke gbãtɔ dzi.
What is it that’s bothering you? 	Nukae le fu ɖem na wò?
It was a dog.	Enye avu aɖe.
Think about how long that took.	Bu ɣeyiɣi didi si ema xɔ ŋu kpɔ.
It’s a great, great, great project that awaits us next year.	Enye dɔ gã gã gã aɖe si le mía lalam le ƒe si gbɔna me.
Or maybe it’s just me.	Alo ɖewohĩ nye koe.
I have no idea whatsoever.	Susu aɖeke mele asinye o.
It doesn’t matter.	Mehiã o.
Consider two factors.	Bu nya eve aɖewo ŋu kpɔ.
He seemed to enjoy it.	Edze abe edzɔ dzi nɛ ene.
I approached him myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mete ɖe eŋu.
His comment surprised me.	Eƒe nya sia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
That’s easier.	Ema le bɔbɔe wu.
He tried to have a heart, but he had none.	Edze agbagba be dzi nanɔ ye si, gake ɖeke menɔ esi o.
Maybe next year.	Ðewohĩ le ƒe si gbɔna me.
Better places for the money.	Teƒe siwo nyo wu na ga la.
The last stage is in the last house.	Akpa mamlɛtɔ le aƒe mamlɛtɔ me.
It's in there.	Ele eme le afima.
Let us deal with that in a mature way.	Mina míawɔ nu ɖe ​​ema ŋu le mɔ si tsi nyuie nu.
He treated everyone kindly.	Ewɔ nu ɖe ​​amesiame ŋu nyuie.
That fire was always there.	Dzo ma nɔ anyi ɣesiaɣi.
He was not a spontaneous man.	Menye ŋutsu si wɔa nu le eɖokui si ye wònye o.
This is very true, it has a point.	Esia nye nyateƒe ŋutɔ, nya aɖe le esi.
The shock is real.	Nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ la nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I think it will be great.	Mesusu be anye gã.
It’s just my name.	Nye ŋkɔ koe.
They like what they have.	Nusi le wo si la dzɔa dzi na wo.
I remember it so well.	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie ale gbegbe.
It may take up to a month.	Ate ŋu axɔ ɣleti ɖeka.
He couldn’t bear it.	Mete ŋu do dzi o.
You can explain it.	Àte ŋu aɖe eme.
And of course, it may or may not be.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ate ŋu anye alo manɔ nenema o.
But not in this case.	Gake menye le go sia me o.
But they are	Gake wole .
And it could be anything.	Eye ate ŋu anye nusianu.
I’ve never seen them before.	Nyemekpɔ wo kpɔ o.
He can at least try.	Ate ŋu ate kpɔ ya teti.
He hasn’t met yet.	Medo go haɖe o.
This is more interesting.	Esia doa dzidzɔ na ame wu.
He would probably feel very good about that.	Anɔ eme be ase le eɖokui me be nu ma si wòwɔ la dze ye ŋu ŋutɔ.
I’m not sure, actually.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o, le nyateƒe me.
That was what he wanted.	Emae nye nusi dim wònɔ.
There was another issue.	Nya bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
You and you alone will do it.	Wò kple wò ɖeka koe awɔe.
Who knew you were with us.	Amekae nya be èle mía gbɔ.
He didn't seem to care much.	Edze abe metsɔ ɖeke le eme boo o ene.
I just work.	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ.
Everything will work.	Nusianu awɔ dɔ.
There is nothing we can do.	Naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ o.
Or maybe it’s.	Alo ɖewohĩ.
It was the most embarrassing thing ever.	Enye nusi ŋu kpe wu ɖesiaɖe kpɔ.
Maybe maybe not.	Ðewohĩ ɖewohĩ mawɔe nenema o.
He doesn’t seem to have a real life.	Edze abe agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke meli nɛ o ene.
Few people know this.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nya esia.
Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.	Edze abe amesiame nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm ene.
No one is sure of it.	Ame aɖeke meka ɖe edzi o.
There is still much to do.	Nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.
You may not be able to.	Ðewohĩ màte ŋui o.
Still, it can happen.	Ke hã ate ŋu adzɔ.
It’s a pretty big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I'm going to get you.	Mele wò xɔ ge.
He will be happy.	Akpɔ dzidzɔ.
It can do us good in two ways.	Ate ŋu awɔ nyui na mí le mɔ eve nu.
But what happened, happened.	Gake nusi dzɔ la, dzɔ.
This is just wrong.	Ðeko esia nye nu gbegblẽ.
Water is very expensive.	Tsi xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
It would have been that way.	Anɔ nenema hafi.
It doesn’t matter at all.	Mele vevie kura o.
It’s already started.	Edze egɔme xoxo.
Or right now.	Alo fifia ŋutɔ.
He struggled with that thought.	Ewɔ avu kple susu ma.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
He was focused on it.	Eƒe susu nɔ eŋu.
Maybe too complicated.	Ðewohĩ nusi me kɔ akpa.
Do you think you can eat like this?.	Èsusu be yeate ŋu aɖu nu alea?.
Seems like my own idea to me.	Edze abe nye ŋutɔ nye susu ene nam.
I do not know.	Nye menya o.
But we know we have life.	Gake míenya be agbe le mía si.
He hasn’t come home yet.	Meva aƒeme haɖe o.
That makes sense to them.	Susu le nya ma me na wo.
No one else needs us.	Ame bubu aɖeke meli si hiã mí o.
I should have known better.	Ðe wòle be manya nyuie wu hafi.
So are you, too.	Nenema ke wò hã nèle.
But too long.	Gake didi akpa.
Seems to me like it’s about the same thing.	Edze nam abe ɖe wòle abe nu ɖeka ma ke ene.
I know everything.	Menya nusianu.
I am actually doing this.	Mele esia wɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Songs you don’t know, songs no one has ever heard.	Ha siwo mènya o, ha siwo ame aɖeke mese kpɔ o.
I think that might work.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ema awɔ dɔ.
He can do better than that.	Ate ŋu awɔ nu nyuie wu ema.
Physical personal relics.	Ame ŋutɔ ƒe nu siwo tsi anyi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This only makes them angrier.	Ðeko esia doa dziku na wo ɖe edzi.
But there is one thing.	Gake nu ɖeka aɖe li.
Heat over medium heat.	Do dzo ɖe dzo si sɔ dzi.
He was a really nice guy.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It contains one or more people.	Ame ɖeka alo esi wu nenema le eme.
As it is now.	Abe alesi wòle fifia ene.
Change that, if necessary.	Trɔ ema, ne ehiã.
After all, this is a book.	Le nyateƒe me la, agbalẽ aɖee nye esia.
You made that happen.	Wòe na ema va eme.
He didn’t ask about me.	Mebia nya tso ŋunye o.
I offer you another way.	Metsɔ mɔ bubu aɖe na wò.
I would be very happy.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
That’s really my issue.	Emae nye nye nya ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Some of them are certainly responsive.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo wɔa nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu godoo.
Don’t know if that’s a good thing.	Mènya nenye be nu nyui aɖee nye ema o.
No one could say what they were there for.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu gblɔ nusi ta wole afima ɖo o.
It is not too late for us.	Metsi megbe akpa na mí o.
Something about time.	Nane si ku ɖe ɣeyiɣi ŋu.
The market came crashing down.	Asi la va dze anyi.
I don’t see anything more we can do now.	Nyemekpɔ naneke wu ema si míate ŋu awɔ fifia o.
Now you know.	Fifia ènya.
Healthy foods that will last for a long time.	Nuɖuɖu nyui siwo anɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi.
It was too surprising to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam akpa.
I need something that works, just once.	Mehiã nane si awɔ dɔ, zi ɖeka ko.
Get angry with me.	Do dziku ɖe ŋunye.
He can’t do that.	Mate ŋu awɔ ema o.
I can’t say anything yet.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke haɖe o.
I was just surprised that he cared about us.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku nam be etsɔ ɖe le mía me.
In the end, he did nothing.	Mlɔeba la, mewɔ naneke o.
I knew it was going on.	Menya be ele edzi yim.
There is some reality there.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖewo le afima.
In fact, he didn’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
We have a room here.	Xɔ aɖe le mía si le afisia.
Not for me.	Menye nam o.
Now pass right by them.	Azɔ to wo gbɔ tututu.
And this will be.	Eye esia anye.
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
Each place has something a little different to offer.	Nane si to vovo vie le teƒe ɖesiaɖe si wòate ŋu ana.
That can help you out.	Ema ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I just didn’t know about that guy.	Ðeko nyemenya nu tso ŋutsu ma ŋu o.
Everything is working.	Nusianu le dɔ wɔm.
Now, there’s me.	Azɔ, nyee li.
Really amazing stuff.	Nu siwo wɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He has to fight.	Ele be wòawɔ avu.
Perhaps there is an easier way.	Ðewohĩ mɔ aɖe li si le bɔbɔe wu.
What do you think.	Nukae nèsusu be.
Fire won’t bother him now.	Dzo maɖe fu nɛ fifia o.
I felt a bit like that myself.	Nye ŋutɔ hã mese le ɖokuinye me nenema vie.
Very few people live here throughout the year.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔa afisia le ƒe bliboa me.
Someone did that to me too.	Ame aɖe wɔ nu ma ɖe ŋunye hã.
It seems obvious.	Edze abe edze ƒã ene.
I have proved it before.	Meɖo kpe edzi kpɔ.
This will be a great full-time season for him.	Esia anye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe si me ɣeyiɣi bliboa katã le nɛ.
I am working very hard on this.	Mele dɔ wɔm vevie ŋutɔ le esia ŋu.
A strong wind blew across the lake.	Ya sesẽ aɖe ƒo to ta la dzi.
This dress is too short.	Awu sia le kpuie akpa.
I almost fell into it.	Medze anyi ɖe eme kloe.
In my head, there should be no problem.	Le nye ta me la, mele be kuxi aɖeke nanɔ anyi o.
Come on, everyone.	Va, amesiame.
Everything is over.	Nusianu wu enu.
That has done it before.	Emae wɔe kpɔ.
I am here instead of in his place.	Mele afisia le esi teƒe be manɔ eƒe teƒe.
Something else must have caught his attention.	Nu bubu aɖe anya lé eƒe susu.
What that might be, he had no idea.	Nusi ema ate ŋu anye la, menya naneke tso eŋu o.
It was a huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖee wònye.
He understood nothing about that.	Mese naneke gɔme le nya ma ŋu o.
This one will never work.	Esia ɖeka maɖe vi gbeɖe o.
With good food, he was satisfied.	Esi nuɖuɖu nyuie ta la, eƒe dzi dze eme.
He made a plan for it.	Ewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
And there were those who did not.	Eye ame aɖewo hã nɔ anyi siwo mewɔe nenema o.
As we move forward.	Esi míele ŋgɔ yim.
But it won’t be that easy.	Gake manɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
It’s been a long day.	Ŋkeke didi aɖee nye esia.
That at least made me feel at home.	Ema ya teti na mese le ɖokuinye me be mele aƒeme.
That’s what I expected too.	Emae nye nye hã mekpɔ mɔ na.
And someone did, too.	Eye ame aɖe hã wɔe nenema.
Every moment is precious.	Ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Also simple and easy.	Azɔ hã, ele bɔbɔe eye wòle bɔbɔe.
He didn’t look away.	Meɖe ŋku ɖa le eŋu o.
Really? 	Nyateƒea?
So it shouldn’t be a surprise.	Eya ta mele be wòawɔ nuku na mí o.
Mava o.	Mava o.
It is so easy for a child.	Ele bɔbɔe ale gbegbe na ɖevi.
That’s his only way, that’s all.	Ema koe nye eƒe mɔ, eya koe nye ema.
What he was doing was very simple.	Nusi wɔm wònɔ la nɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
He really didn’t know what this was.	Le nyateƒe me la, menya nusi esia nye o.
Please say another.	Taflatse gblɔ bubu.
Maybe that’s pretty good.	Ðewohĩ ema nyo ŋutɔ.
This doesn’t make sense to me.	Susu mele nya sia me nam o.
He started a new diet.	Edze nuɖuɖu yeye aɖe gɔme.
I want to tell you more.	Medi be magblɔ nya geɖe wu na mi.
An idea struck him.	Susu aɖe va dze edzi nɛ.
You can find them along with this post.	Àte ŋu akpɔ wo tsɔ kpe ɖe nya sia ŋu.
Almost every one of them did.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe kloe wɔe nenema.
I think that’s about it now.	Mesusu be emae ku ɖe eŋu fifia.
But something compelled me to continue.	Gake nane zi dzinye be mayi edzi.
He is doing the right thing too.	Eya hã le nu nyui wɔm.
However, it is not.	Ke hã, mele nenema o.
If only there was something better.	Ne ɖe nane li si nyo wu la.
He was really comfortable whenever he could get away from himself.	Eƒe dzi dze eme ŋutɔŋutɔ ɣesiaɣi si wòate ŋu aɖe eɖokui ɖa le eɖokui me.
They will do anything for money.	Woawɔ nusianu ɖe ​​ga ta.
But there was a problem with that.	Gake kuxi aɖe nɔ ema ŋu.
But, this is up to you.	Gake, esia le asiwò.
I can’t comment on that.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke tso ema ŋu o.
That’s what he lived for.	Ema tae wònɔ agbe ɖo.
There is no money for them.	Ga aɖeke meli na wo o.
I don’t have anyone.	Ame aɖeke mele asinye o.
This has been going on for a long time.	Esia le edzi yim ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There wasn’t much.	Nu geɖe menɔ anyi o.
And well, it was me.	Eye nyuie, nyee.
Things have changed.	Nuwo trɔ.
Not that he has much.	Menye be nu geɖe le esi o.
He didn’t bother himself.	Meɖe fu na eɖokui o.
How to get warm.	Ale si woawɔ axɔ dzo.
A car will be waiting for them.	Ʋu aɖe anɔ lalam na wo.
Everything went well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
This will be my death.	Esia anye nye ku.
Strong and clear, no less.	Sesẽ eye eme kɔ, menye nu sue o.

I am going to work with this.	Mele dɔ wɔ ge kple esia.
Thanks again for this post, truly awesome.	Akpe ake ɖe nya sia ta, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.

It seems to be the case.	Edze abe ɖe wòle nenema ene.

He had never heard a word.	Mese nya aɖeke kpɔ o.
I don’t know where he is now.	Nyemenya afisi wòle fifia o.
I am too old for you.	Metsi akpa na wò.
You know you are me.	Ènya be nyee nènye.
Move to a better place.	Ʋu yi teƒe nyui aɖe.
A car will hit the dog.	Ʋu aɖe aƒo avu la.
It is more than that, much more than that.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema, wu ema kura.
I could have stayed there for hours.	Anye ne mate ŋu anɔ afima gaƒoƒo geɖe hafi.
One can feel it.	Ame ate ŋu ase le eɖokui me.
It will be a good day.	Anye ŋkeke nyui aɖe.
You have to act that way.	Ele be nàwɔ nu nenema.
I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
It’s a strong hand.	Asi sesẽ aɖee wònye.
More of them are coming.	Wo dometɔ geɖe wu gbɔna.
He couldn’t trust anyone.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋu ɖe ame aɖeke ŋu o.
I don’t know if it’s possible.	Nyemenya ne anya wɔ o.
But there can be none.	Gake ɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
It’s the right thing for them.	Enye nusi sɔ na wo.
I probably grew that.	Anɔ eme be metsi ema.
Surprisingly, he was calm now.	Ewɔ nuku be eƒe dzi dze eme fifia.
I really enjoy that.	Ema dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I will fight it tomorrow.	Mawɔ avu kplii etsɔ.
Talk about it.	Ƒo nu tso eŋu.
Many of them survived.	Wo dometɔ geɖe tsi agbe.
There is no better gun and the price is amazing.	Tu aɖeke meli si nyo wu ema o eye asi si le edzi la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I do this a lot.	Mewɔa esia ŋutɔ.

I couldn’t stand them.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe wo nu o.

This is working very well.	Esia le dɔ wɔm nyuie ŋutɔ.
And it never was.	Eye menɔ nenema kpɔ o.

There is obviously something like that.	Edze ƒã be nane le nenema.
In fact, it may not work for years.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ mawɔ dɔ ƒe geɖe o.
You can’t just eat anything.	Màte ŋu aɖu naneke ko o.
You never know what could happen.	Mènya nusi ate ŋu adzɔ gbeɖe o.

I really liked the characters in this book.	Ame siwo le agbalẽ sia me la dze ŋunye ŋutɔ.
I had the same problem.	Kuxi ma ke nɔ ŋunye.
It’s something in a car way beyond reason.	Enye nane si le ʋu me mɔ si gbɔ susu ŋu.
But that’s neither here nor there.	Gake ema menye afisia alo afima o.
Short of the teti.	Kpuie ya teti.
Stop, that voice said in my head.	Dzudzɔ, gbe ma gblɔ le nye ta me.
About the project.	Le dɔa ŋu.
But more needs to be done.	Gake ehiã be woawɔ geɖe wu.
But I can’t do that.	Gake nyemate ŋu awɔ ema o.
What will you do with the money?	Nukae nàwɔ kple ga la?
People really supported this.	Amewo kpe asi ɖe esia ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s my last point.	Emae nye nye nya mamlɛtɔ.
A new voice has emerged here.	Gbe yeye aɖe va do le afisia.
See this for yourself.	Wò ŋutɔ kpɔ esia ɖa.
I'll call him as soon as we get home.	Maƒo ka nɛ ne míenya ɖo aƒeme ko.
In fact, quite a lot.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
Anything 'is possible.	Nusianu 'ate ŋu adzɔ.
His character really came through.	Eƒe nɔnɔme va to eme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There were well-dressed people.	Ame siwo do awu nyuie nɔ afima.
No one said anything.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
He needs some help.	Ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo.
Kind of the opposite.	Nusi to vovo na ema ƒomevi.
Maybe it played a role.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ akpa aɖe le eme.
His own way.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe mɔ.
I had to do what was best for him.	Ele be mawɔ nu si anyo nɛ wu.
We have known each other for a long time.	Míenya mía nɔewo ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
That, too, is impossibly strange.	Ema hã wɔ nuku ale gbegbe be mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I will continue.	Mayi edzi.
I can take some time, now.	Mate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe, fifia.
That’s really amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He is doing really well in his career.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ le eƒe dɔa me.
Hope you are doing well.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be èle edzi dzem nyuie.
My breakfast.	Nye ŋdi nuɖuɖu.
That’s my problem.	Emae nye nye kuxi.
You have our case.	Míaƒe nya la le asiwò.
And it’s old school.	Eye enye suku xoxo.
And he never will.	Eye mawɔe gbeɖe o.
Be very careful here.	Kpɔ nyuie le afisia ŋutɔ.
I made that one up.	Nyee wɔ ɖeka ma.
Now that's a little late, damage.	Fifia nya ma tsi megbe vie, nu gblẽ le eŋu.
I wasn’t happy with it.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu o.
It felt no problem, and therefore no joy.	Mese le eɖokui me be kuxi aɖeke mele eŋu o, eye le esia ta dzidzɔ aɖeke menɔ eme o.
People died.	Amewo ku.
Thank you for this wonderful morning.	Akpe na mi ɖe ŋdi nyui sia ta.
They have been facing these problems for a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si wole kuxi siawo me tom.
None of them recognized him.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mekpɔ dze sii o.
Good planning is needed.	Ehiã be woawɔ ɖoɖo nyuie.
I will say this though.	Magblɔ nya sia ke hã.
Much like himself.	Geɖe abe eya ŋutɔ hã ene.
Get out of my town.	Do go le nye du me.
He needs more time.	Ehiã ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu.
I'll do it.	Mawɔe.
No one knows why or what led to this.	Ame aɖeke menya nusita alo nusi na esia dzɔ o.
I hope we can get the full episode tomorrow!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be míate ŋu axɔ eƒe akpa bliboa etsɔ!.
His real life.	Eƒe agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Every one of them is fine with me.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe le nyuie nam.
His house is near the market.	Eƒe aƒe te ɖe asi ŋu.
None of them are easy.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele bɔbɔe o.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
But its not there yet.	Gake eƒe mele afima haɖe o.
That’s something none of us can control.	Ema nye nusi dzi mía dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu aɖu o.
He made two plans.	Ewɔ ɖoɖo eve.
Again, the same is true.	Le afisia hã la, nenema ke.
This place is not old.	Teƒe sia metsi o.
Several times I have been here myself.	Zi geɖe la, nye ŋutɔ meva afisia.
I just couldn’t do it.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu wɔe o.
You know he can’t.	Ènya be mate ŋui o.
It’s a really big deal.	Enye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There had never been anyone else.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
He couldn't see a face now.	Mete ŋu kpɔ mo aɖeke fifia o.
All things are the same.	Nuwo katã nye ɖeka.
A person's own character.	Ame aɖe ŋutɔ ƒe nɔnɔme.
Of what happened between us.	Le nusi dzɔ le mía dome ŋu.
It’s amazing, actually.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
It’s not that simple.	Menye ɖe wòle bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
These roads are not in good condition.	Mɔ siawo mele nɔnɔme nyui me o.
Let’s do this by creating a new role.	Mina míawɔ esia to akpa yeye aɖe wɔwɔ me.
For myself.	Na nye ŋutɔ.
I, too, have been changed by name.	Nye hã, ŋkɔ trɔ asi le ŋunye.
We can do whatever you want.	Míate ŋu awɔ nusianu si nèdi.
Just do what you want.	Nu si nèdi koe wɔ.
Someone made a mistake.	Ame aɖe wɔ vodada.
You can tell him exactly what you think.	Àte ŋu agblɔ nu si tututu nèsusu nɛ.
I'm sure we can make it work though.	Meka ɖe edzi be míate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ ke hã.
I enjoy doing my job.	Nye dɔa wɔwɔ dzɔa dzi nam.
Not much more now.	Menye nu geɖe wu fifia o.
He went wrong after that.	Ewɔ nu gbegblẽ le ema megbe.
It was a very big deal.	Enye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
That’s just one thing.	Nu ɖeka koe nye ema.
That is true enough.	Ema nye nyateƒe si sɔ gbɔ.
There is no one here.	Ame aɖeke mele afisia o.
This is always important.	Esia le vevie ɣesiaɣi.
Which leaves us with another more surprising possibility.	Nusi gblẽ nu bubu si ate ŋu adzɔ si wɔ nuku wu la ɖi na mí.
You have to act.	Ele be nàwɔ nu.
That was another room.	Xɔ bubu aɖee nye ema.
There was no death.	Ku aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Still, he did them.	Ke hã, ewɔ wo.
He is trying to solve a difficult problem.	Ele agbagba dzem be yeakpɔ kuxi sesẽ aɖe gbɔ.
But there is no help.	Gake kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke meli o.
One person raised his hand.	Ame ɖeka do asi ɖe dzi.
I’m a very simple guy, who wants to do some very simple things.	Nyee nye ŋutsu bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔ, si di be yeawɔ nu bɔbɔe aɖewo ŋutɔ.
That will do that.	Ema awɔe nenema.
He needs someone to take good care of him.	Ehiã ame aɖe si akpɔ edzi nyuie.
Stay near the highway!	Nɔ mɔ gã la gbɔ!
Like me, too.	Abe nye ene.
But, of course, anything will.	Gake, le nyateƒe me la, nusianu awɔe nenema.
If you had a thousand people, a week or so.	Ne ame akpe ɖeka nɔ asiwò la, ke kwasiɖa ɖeka alo esi wu nenema.
No one was simple enough for me to understand.	Ame aɖeke menɔ bɔbɔe ale gbegbe be mate ŋu ase egɔme o.
That was very exciting for me.	Ema do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
Throw them away.	Tsɔ wo ƒu gbe.
Life is very precious.	Agbe xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Everything, and nothing.	Nusianu, eye naneke meli o.
I'm here.	Mele afisia.
That didn’t surprise him.	Ema mewɔ nuku nɛ o.
This book is really interesting.	Agbalẽ sia doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
A really good design.	Aɖaŋu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Keep going, keep going.	Yi edzi, yi edzi.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
Lots of thinking about it.	Eŋu bubu geɖe.
He hasn’t said anything yet.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke vaseɖe fifia o.
But it’s not for people.	Gake menye amewo tɔ o.
I gave him my hand.	Metsɔ nye asi nɛ.
I wasn’t that surprised.	Mewɔ nuku nam nenema gbegbe o.
But without water there is no air.	Gake tsi manɔmee la, ya meli o.
Perhaps he was expecting something else.	Ðewohĩ nu bubu aɖee wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na.
I don’t want to talk.	Nyemedi be maƒo nu o.
There really is something for everyone.	Le nyateƒe me la, nane li na amesiame.
I liked something else.	Nu bubu aɖe hã dzɔ dzi nam.
So will everyone else.	Nenema ke ame sia ame hã anɔ.
This is all he can do.	Esia koe nye nusi wòate ŋu awɔ.
I just couldn’t let that happen.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ɖe mɔ nenema o.
There might have been.	Ðewohĩ anɔ anyi hafi.
He didn’t say today.	Megblɔ be egbea o.
In fact, none of them are.	Le nyateƒe me la, wo dometɔ aɖeke mele nenema o.
He absentmindedly petted the dog.	Etsɔ asi ƒo avu la le susu me nɛ o.
It is a simple task.	Enye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖe.
It just doesn’t work that way.	Mewɔa dɔ nenema ko o.
Everyone was excited.	Dzi dzɔ amesiame.
My hair is very long.	Nye ɖa didi ŋutɔ.
We are here, too.	Míele afisia hã.
But something more than that.	Gake nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema.
Part of you does it anyway.	Wò akpa aɖe wɔa esia to mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Which is a real issue.	Nusi nye nya ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That worked great for me.	Ema wɔ dɔ nam ŋutɔ.
Two hours later, the same.	Le gaƒoƒo eve megbe la, nenema ke.
Like they still had work to do.	Abe alesi dɔ gakpɔtɔ nɔ wo si woawɔ ene.
He didn’t tell me anything at all.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke nam kura o.
This is a very simple technique.	Esia nye aɖaŋu si le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Every morning and every night.	Ŋdi sia ŋdi kple zã sia zã.
I can put them together.	Mate ŋu aƒo wo nu ƒu ɖekae.
None of us can do anything like this.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ naneke si le abe esia ene o.
I never really knew you.	Nyemenya wò ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o.
Anger overcame him,	Dziku ɖu edzi, .
Think of me for me.	Bu ŋunye le ŋunye.
I know what you want and where it is.	Menya nusi dim nèle kple afisi wòle.
And it worked.	Eye ewɔ dɔ.
I was too friendly.	Mewɔa nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu akpa.
Your man lives in the same city.	Wò ame la le du ma ke me.
I decided to let it go.	Meɖoe be maɖe asi le eŋu.
I did the right thing.	Mewɔ nu si sɔ.
It’s a place you created.	Enye teƒe si nèwɔ.
Four years is a reasonable amount of time.	Ƒe ene nye ɣeyiɣi si sɔ.
We are of one mind.	Míenye susu ɖeka.
And not well either.	Eye menye nyuie hã o.
It will be about.	Anɔ abe.
And that’s just from the neck.	Eye ema tso kɔ dzi ko.
It will be close to him.	Ate ɖe eŋu.
This trend continued for too long.	Nɔnɔme sia yi edzi ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
This book.	Agbalẽ sia.
. . . .	.
I'm just trying once.	Ðeko mele agbagba dzem zi ɖeka ko.
Are you ready to go?	Ðe nèle klalo be yeayi?
It was a good year.	Ƒe nyui aɖee wònye.
He most likely never saw a gun.	Anɔ eme godoo be mekpɔ tu kpɔ o.
I came to the apartment, but only for one night.	Meva xɔa me, gake zã ɖeka koe.
To tell me the truth.	Be magblɔ nyateƒea nam.
I have to do the right thing.	Ele be mawɔ nu si sɔ.
He won't talk to them now.	Maƒo nu kpli wo fifia o.
There are two possible reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
Say it will be the last time.	Gblɔ be anye zi mamlɛtɔ.
He is here, but, not for long.	Ele afisia, gake, menye eteƒe didi o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
And do things.	Eye nàwɔ nuwo.
I wouldn’t have it.	Anye ne manɔ asinye o.
Like the first one.	Abe gbãtɔ ene.
I can’t tell exactly where it is.	Nyemate ŋu anya afi si tututu wòle o.
I can do no wrong.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
There is someone here.	Ame aɖe le afisia.
He’s so charming.	Eƒe nu lé dzi na ame ale gbegbe.
You can, but not me.	Àte ŋui, gake menye nyee o.
I said something anyway.	Megblɔ nya aɖe le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
They seem to be waiting for something.	Edze abe wole nane lalam ene.
I haven’t seen you since you were little.	Nyemekpɔ wò tso esime nènye sue o.
It’s a double-edged sword.	Enye zi gbɔ zi eve.
A patient corpse.	Ame kuku aɖe si gbɔ dzi ɖi.
It's not working for me for some reason.	Mele dɔ wɔm nam le susu aɖewo ta o.
That’s what we like.	Ema dzɔa dzi na mí.
One of them didn’t answer.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka meɖo eŋu o.
Now there were only two.	Fifia ame eve koe nɔ anyi.
I liked that part of it.	Eƒe akpa ma dze ŋunye.
That’s always on my mind.	Ema nɔa susu me nam ɣesiaɣi.
The exact form doesn’t matter.	Ale si tututu wòle la mele vevie o.
I came here to.	Meva afisia be.
It was a very nice place.	Enye teƒe nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I was also angry with myself.	Azɔ hã medo dziku ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu.
This issue has arrived.	Nya sia va ɖo.
As a matter of fact.	Abe nya ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
He didn’t believe me, of course.	Mexɔ dzinye se o ya.
I can’t quite do it tomorrow.	Nyemate ŋui tututu etsɔ o.
Its your gun.	Eƒe wò tu.
For today, or.	Na egbea, alo.
But this didn’t feel like that.	Gake esia mese le eɖokui me nenema o.
I looked good.	Medze nyuie.
I have never been so excited about anything in my life.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe naneke ŋu nenema gbegbe le nye agbe me kpɔ o.
They just had a heart.	Dzi aɖe koe nɔ wo si.
This is a problem for me.	Esia nye kuxi nam.
I just want to keep going.	Ðeko medi be mayi edzi.
It just won’t do it.	Ðeko mawɔe o.
This is very difficult.	Esia sesẽ ŋutɔ.
And there was everything in between.	Eye nusianu nɔ wo dome.
Everything is very simple and easy.	Nusianu le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ eye wòle bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
It didn’t feel like anything.	Mese le eɖokui me abe naneke ene o.
But he hasn’t been able to get back to them yet.	Gake mete ŋu trɔ yi wo gbɔ haɖe o.
I’m the only one who gets so upset about it.	Nye ɖeka koe doa dziku ɖe eŋu alea.
There is something about it.	Nane le eŋu.
He wasn’t satisfied.	Eƒe dzi medze eme o.
As long as it’s there.	Zi alesi wòle afima ko la.
They have a lot in common.	Nu geɖe le wo dome si sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
This house is brand new!	Aƒe sia nye yeye kura!
There must be water there.	Ele be tsi nanɔ anyi le afima.
His voice is catchy.	Eƒe gbe lé ame.
Everyone has a job to do.	Dɔ le amesiame si wòawɔ.
People expect them.	Amewo kpɔa mɔ na wo.
His character is difficult.	Eƒe nɔnɔme sesẽ.
People are looking for us.	Amewo le mía dim.
There was no one from.	Ame aɖeke menɔ anyi tso.
I am not ready now.	Nyemele klalo fifia o.
Clever horses.	Sɔ siwo dze aɖaŋu.
No one knows what death is, or can know.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi ku nye o, alo mate ŋu anya o.
I am very happy to be here.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mele afisia.
It would be a great shot.	Anye tu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
It had been a great first season for us.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gbãtɔ gã aɖe na mí tsã.
When you are asking a question.	Ne èle nya biam.
I think you can do it.	Mesusu be àte ŋu awɔe.
I made it work.	Mewɔe be wòawɔ dɔ.
This is just the state of where we are now.	Afisi míele fifia ƒe nɔnɔme koe nye esia.
Very much the way things are in my house today.	Alesi nuwo le le nye aƒe me egbea ŋutɔ.
He can win, win.	Ate ŋu aɖu dzi, aɖu dzi.
He was a great guy.	Enye ŋutsu gã aɖe.
But he didn’t know that.	Gake menya ema o.
It’s so obvious, and yet.	Edze ƒã ale gbegbe, eye ke hã.
I am looking forward to it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie.
The same logic applies here.	Susu ma ke le afisia hã.
That was a first for us.	Ema nye gbãtɔ na mí.
It would be great if you could help me.	Anyo ŋutɔ ne àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
Some of them may have changed.	Ðewohĩ wo dometɔ aɖewo trɔ.
He liked the effect.	Dɔ si wòwɔ ɖe ame dzi la dze eŋu ŋutɔ.
There are at least two reasons for this.	Susu eve ya teti li siwo tae wòle alea ɖo.
I have to go as far as I can go.	Ele be mayi ŋgɔ alesi mate ŋui.
I wasn’t free at all.	Vovo menɔ ŋunye kura o.
You are where you want to be.	Wòe nye afisi nèdi be yeanɔ.
I think he really cares.	Mesusu be etsɔ ɖe le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t want to.	Nyemedi o.
Not really what we had in mind.	Menye nusi nɔ susu me na mí ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
After her disappearance, police investigated.	Le eƒe bu megbe la, kpovitɔwo ku nu me.
A house that suffered.	Aƒe aɖe si kpe fu.
And his face changed.	Eye eƒe mo trɔ.
This helped me a lot.	Esia kpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ.
The money is hot.	Ga la xɔ dzo.
And his heart, too.	Eye eƒe dzi hã.
How do you acquire this skill?	Aleke nàwɔ axɔ aɖaŋu sia?
Something impressed me.	Nu aɖe wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye.
That would be great.	Ema anyo ŋutɔ.
You have limited time.	Ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe le asiwò.
But do it once, not once a week.	Gake wɔe zi ɖeka, ke menye zi ɖeka le kwasiɖa me o.
It’s not what works.	Menye nusi wɔa dɔ o.
He did everything right.	Ewɔ nusianu nyuie.
We had some schools there.	Suku aɖewo nɔ mía si le afima.
He was a very small man.	Enye ame sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
Everyone was there.	Amesiame nɔ afima.
I don’t know this person.	Nyemenya ame sia o.
No one greeted anyone.	Ame aɖeke medo gbe na ame o.
But this quality is not in anyone at all.	Gake nɔnɔme sia mele ame aɖeke kura me o.
It is really a matter of life and death.	Enye agbe kple ku ƒe nya ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He needs your help.	Ehiã wò kpekpeɖeŋu.
The word took shape in my mind.	Nya la xɔ nɔnɔme le nye susu me.
I tried something different this time.	Mete nu bubu aɖe kpɔ zi sia.
We are short enough as it is.	Míele kpuie ale gbegbe abe alesi wòle ene.
It is now a city in its own right.	Fifia enye du le eɖokui si.
I’m really happy about it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ le eŋu.
A month has passed.	Ɣleti ɖeka va yi.
I was really late.	Metsi megbe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I heard nothing from them at all.	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso wo gbɔ kura o.
This is too good to be true.	Esia nyo akpa.
This time, it could be better.	Fifia ya, ate ŋu anyo wu.
Create your own passionate words.	Wò ŋutɔ wɔ nya siwo me dzo le.
We have a great place for this.	Teƒe gã aɖe le mía si na esia.
It is such a fun and easy project.	Enye dɔ si doa dzidzɔ na ame eye wòle bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
He has no margin for error.	Vodada ƒe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke mele esi o.
They are working very well.	Wole dɔ wɔm nyuie ŋutɔ.
Some people are like that.	Ame aɖewo le nenema.
But for a good reason.	Gake nu nyui aɖe tae.
He was a very tough kid.	Enye ɖevi sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
We hope you enjoy this post.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be nya sia adzɔ dzi na wò.
Not sure why it isn't working.	Nyemeka ɖe nusita mele dɔ wɔm o dzi o.
I wasn’t in charge of them.	Menye nyee nɔ wo dzi kpɔm o.
Here in this small town, everyone knows everyone else.	Le du sue sia me afisia la, amesiame nya ame bubu ɖesiaɖe.
That’s a tough one.	Ema nye nya sesẽ aɖe.
It seems to be somewhere else.	Edze abe teƒe bubu aɖee wòle ene.
He couldn’t save his life.	Mete ŋu ɖe eƒe agbe o.
The room is dirty!	Xɔa me ƒo ɖi!
You have to cooperate with him.	Ele be nàwɔ ɖeka kplii.
The circumstances here.	Nɔnɔme siwo le afisia.
He couldn’t give up.	Mete ŋu na ta o.
Everyone talks about it.	Amesiame ƒoa nu tso eŋu.
There is someone who is	Ame aɖe li si nye .
There are many problems with these existing models.	Kuxi geɖe li le mɔ̃ siawo siwo li fifia ŋu.
You will have nothing.	Naneke manɔ asiwò o.
Thank you very, very much.	Akpe na mi ŋutɔ, geɖe ŋutɔ.
He didn’t know what to do either.	Eya hã menya nusi wòawɔ o.
And he can’t either.	Eye mate ŋui hã o.
His mind, but not his mind.	Eƒe susu, gake menye eƒe susu o.
I couldn’t think of what to say.	Nyemete ŋu bu nya si magblɔ ŋu o.
I have given you a great job.	Metsɔ dɔ gã aɖe na mi.
This is not necessary.	Esia mehiã o.
Come to your senses.	Va susu me na wò.
Maybe I’m not the one doing the work.	Ðewohĩ menye nyee nye amesi wɔa dɔa o.
Take a closer look at them.	Lé ŋku ɖe wo ŋu nyuie.
In this type of work.	Le dɔ sia ƒomevi wɔwɔ me.
Nothing much matters.	Nu boo aɖeke mele vevie o.
I met him on the first day of school this year.	Medo go le ƒe sia ƒe suku ƒe ŋkeke gbãtɔ dzi.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anye nenema o.
There was a lot for this.	Nu geɖe nɔ anyi na esia.
It was the first big surprise of his life.	Enye nu gã gbãtɔ si wɔ nuku nɛ le eƒe agbe me.
You great, different.	Wò gã, to vovo.
I will only be here for a year.	Ƒe ɖeka koe manɔ afisia.
His mouth fell open.	Eƒe nu dze anyi ʋu.
And people did die.	Eye amewo ku nyateƒe.
Some of them know things.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nya nuwo.
So will many others.	Nenema ke ame bubu geɖe hã awɔe.
I just did a job.	Dɔ aɖe koe mewɔ.
I made it do just that.	Mewɔe be wòawɔ nu ma tututu.
If he could, I would have done that.	Ne ɖe wòate ŋui la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
He himself had done the same thing the morning before.	Eya ŋutɔ hã wɔ nu ma ke le ŋdi si do ŋgɔ me.
Some things just happened.	Ðeko nu aɖewo dzɔ.
That seems totally reasonable to me.	Edze nam be susu le nya ma me kura.
A few buildings collapsed.	Xɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ge dze anyi.
Let me explain this.	Mina maɖe nya sia me.
That’s what it really is.	Emae nye ema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That doesn’t matter.	Ema mehiã o.
He couldn’t find it, he didn’t feel any.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o, mese le eɖokui me be ɖeke le ye ŋu o.
I was so relaxed.	Nye ɖe dzi ɖi nenema.
I hope you don’t mind.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be maɖe fu na wò o.
It’s been a long time coming.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si gbɔna.
Things are going pretty well.	Nuwo le edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔ.
I just want to get the job done.	Ðeko medi be mawɔ dɔa.
Police arrested them soon after.	Kpovitɔwo lé wo le ema megbe kpuie.
Yet, the result was disastrous.	Ke hã nu gbegblẽ aɖe do tso eme.
If he hasn’t already.	Ne mewɔe haɖe o la.
Whether everything is going well or not.	Ne nusianu le edzi yim nyuie alo mele edzi yim nyuie o.
He couldn’t talk to us.	Mete ŋu ƒo nu na mí o.
Something odd about the car.	Nane si mewɔ nuku o le ʋua ŋu.
That seems a little strange.	Ema dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku vie ene.
This was going to take a lot of work.	Esia nɔ dɔ geɖe xɔ ge.
I think the job worked well for him.	Mesusu be dɔa wɔ dɔ nyuie nɛ.
I would be so happy.	Makpɔ dzidzɔ alea gbegbe.
That is equally difficult.	Ema hã sesẽ nenema ke.
I want to know who did this.	Medi be manya amesi wɔ esia.
I could never find enough time each week.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ ɣeyiɣi si sɔ kwasiɖa sia kwasiɖa gbeɖe o.
I would say you.	Magblɔ be wò.
That didn’t matter.	Ema menɔ vevie o.
Someone’s ear raised its head.	Ame aɖe ƒe to aɖe kɔ ta ɖe dzi.
The nicer cars are usually more expensive.	Zi geɖe la, ʋu siwo nya kpɔ wu la xɔ asi wu.
He can travel.	Ate ŋu azɔ mɔ.
Consider what that means.	Bu nusi ema fia ŋu kpɔ.
This made me feel better.	Esia na nye dzi dze eme.
He has only one leg.	Afɔ ɖeka koe le esi.
There are two parts to it.	Akpa eve le eŋu.
I hope you enjoy them.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wo adzɔ dzi na wò.
I can stand anything if there is a reason.	Mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe nusianu nu ne susu aɖe li si tae.
Anything is possible now that was never possible.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ fifia si mate ŋu adzɔ kpɔ o.
Mine is pretty simple.	Nye tɔ le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Some are still not convinced.	Ame aɖewo gakpɔtɔ meka ɖe edzi o.
That makes no sense.	Susu aɖeke mele nya ma ŋu o.
Share an idea with them.	Gblɔ susu aɖe wo.
But it is legal.	Gake ele se nu.
He obviously wouldn’t be angry.	Edze ƒã be mado dziku o.
He might have left the house.	Ðewohĩ anye ne ado le aƒea me.
Maybe, but not soon.	Ðewohĩ, gake menye kpuie o.
Otherwise an error will occur.	Ne menye nenema o la, vodada aɖe adzɔ.
I know you have work to do.	Menya be dɔ le asiwò nàwɔ.
I can.	Mate ŋu.
Take the job.	Xɔ dɔa.
Everything we have, you would have.	Nusianu si le mía si la, anye ne wò hã anɔ asiwò.
Get a good rest.	Gbɔ ɖe eme nyuie.
The water inside will boil.	Tsi si le eme la aƒo ɖa.
I was angry, too.	Nye hã medo dziku.
It’s just riding on it.	Ðeko wòle sɔ dom ɖe edzi.
No one answered me.	Ame aɖeke meɖo eŋu nam o.
I can’t see anything.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ naneke o.
I don’t think anyone else is here.	Mesusu be ame bubu aɖeke le afisia o.
There was the same thing now.	Nu ma ke nɔ anyi fifia.
No one cared about me.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam o.
We have a lot in common.	Nu geɖe le mía si siwo ɖi wo nɔewo.
This is a great thing.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe.
I couldn’t eat.	Nyemete ŋu ɖu nu o.
Pleasant in the palate.	Nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame le aɖu me.
He probably wouldn’t expect it.	Anɔ eme be makpɔ mɔ nɛ o.
An idea that captured his heart and mind.	Susu si lé eƒe dzi kple susu me.
He's long.	Eya didi.
I could understand that.	Mete ŋu se nya ma gɔme.
We didn’t have anything like this.	Naneke si le abe esia ene menɔ mía si o.
People couldn’t quite seem to get it.	Edze abe amewo mete ŋu se egɔme tututu o ene.
I need you to do something.	Mehiã be nàwɔ nane.
I’ve worked there before.	Mewɔ dɔ le afima kpɔ.
There was only one man there who could be him.	Ŋutsu ɖeka koe nɔ afima si ate ŋu anye eya.
He could easily say that.	Ate ŋu agblɔ nya ma bɔbɔe.
Point a little.	Fia asi vie.
Gather anything that might be useful.	Ƒo nusianu si ate ŋu aɖe vi la nu ƒu.
I don’t know his last name.	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ mamlɛtɔ o.
Reality is kicking in a bit.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ le afɔ ƒom ɖe eme vie.
It doesn’t do the same job.	Mewɔa dɔ ɖeka ma ke o.
I gave myself up.	Metsɔ ɖokuinye na.
There seems to be no reason for that.	Edze abe susu aɖeke meli si tae wòle nenema ɖo o ene.
I want to play this time.	Medi be maƒo ɣeyiɣi sia.
It seems like everyone.	Edze abe amesiame.
Another went, and another went.	Ame bubu yi, eye bubu hã yi.
It was a good thing he couldn’t see me.	Enye nu nyui aɖe be mete ŋu kpɔm o.
And I was pleased with it.	Eye edzɔ dzi nam.
There is so much to do.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li woawɔ.
There is no one there either.	Ame aɖeke mele afima hã o.
You know your room.	Ènya wò xɔ.
Enjoy yourself.	Do dzidzɔ na wò.
There is no one else like you.	Ame bubu aɖeke meli abe wò ene o.
And maybe you are one of them.	Eye ɖewohĩ wò hã nènye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
No one has met them yet.	Ame aɖeke medo go wo haɖe o.
I am here with you.	Mele afisia kpli wò.
I would love to have him too.	Adzɔ dzi nam be eya hã le asinye.
That didn’t surprise me at all.	Ema mewɔ nuku nam kura o.
Everyone in the room knew what must have happened.	Amesiame si nɔ xɔa me nya nusi anya dzɔ.
It’s logical, but not real.	Eƒe susu me kɔ, gake menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I know what he is asking for.	Menya nusi biam wòle.
Date.	Ŋkeke.
I let it go.	Meɖe asi le eŋu.
I did a pretty good job.	Mewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
It wasn’t easy for him.	Menɔ bɔbɔe nɛ o.
Only you know.	Wò ɖeka koe nya.
He shouldn’t have done that either.	Mele be wòawɔ nenema hã hafi o.
Life is good.	Agbe nyo.
Everything seems to matter.	Edze abe nusianu le vevie ene.
A really great design will make a clear statement.	Aɖaŋu gã ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe agblɔ nya aɖe si me kɔ.
I have a big problem.	Kuxi gã aɖe le ŋunye.
You can see that right here.	Àte ŋu akpɔ ema le afisia tututu.
Each for his own.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe na eya ŋutɔ tɔ.
You have to do this.	Ele be nàwɔ esia.
I probably don’t think so.	Anɔ eme be nye susu mele nenema o.
He couldn't work out where he was.	Mete ŋu nɔ dɔ wɔm tso afisi wòle ŋu o.
Be ready to be busy!.	Nɔ klalo be vovo nanɔ ŋuwò!.
That’s one of them.	Ema nye ɖeka.
That was clear enough.	Ema me kɔ nyuie ale gbegbe.
We expect a lot from them.	Míele mɔ kpɔm na nu geɖe tso wo gbɔ.
Understand yourself.	Se nu gɔme na wò ŋutɔ.
There was no one in the room.	Ame aɖeke menɔ xɔa me o.
That’s what we’re getting right.	Emae nye nusi me tom míele nyuie.
As for me, it’s something else.	Ke nye ya la, nu bubu aɖee.
Opportunity was all he wanted.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ koe nye nusi dim wònɔ.
I had to have them all.	Ele be wo katã nanɔ asinye.
Only now have I realized something.	Fifia koe mekpɔ nane dze sii.
I am interested in food.	Metsɔ ɖe le nuɖuɖu me.
And he did not want to treat her badly.	Eye medi be yeawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu le mɔ gbegblẽ nu o.
He didn’t say anything to them.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke na wo o.
Open that case, too.	Ʋu nya ma hã.
I have to go quickly.	Ele be mayi kaba.
What to tell him about me.	Nu si nàgblɔ nɛ tso ŋunye.
I had a lot of great moments.	Mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi gã geɖe.
Only if you don’t mind.	Ne meɖe fu na wò o ko hafi.
It was too improbable.	Enye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o akpa.
No one seems to know what hit them.	Edze abe ame aɖeke menya nusi ƒo wo o ene.
That was what he had just said.	Nya si eya ŋutɔ gblɔ teti koe nye ema.
We have to do something else.	Ele be míawɔ nu bubu aɖe.
I already explained that.	Meɖe nya ma me xoxo.
That’s necessary.	Ema hiã.
A headache of a matter.	Nya aɖe ƒe ta kpe.
We’re never missing anything, which is great.	Míele naneke me tom gbeɖe o, si nyo ŋutɔ.
That’s just another day, another year, another day.	Ðeko ema nye ŋkeke bubu, ƒe bubu, ŋkeke bubu.
That time is over.	Ɣeyiɣi ma wu enu.
Please make it yours.	Taflatse wɔe wò tɔ.
But that might be a bit of an exaggeration.	Gake ema ate ŋu anye nusi gbɔ eme vie.
I was very nervous and very, very angry.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ eye medo dziku ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
I never want you to do anything else.	Nyemedi gbeɖe be nàwɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
Few people work in this field.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔa dɔ le go sia me.
And now this.	Eye fifia esia.
I couldn’t stand it.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te o.
I am very confident in it.	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
I never wanted to, you know.	Nyemedi gbeɖe o, ènya.
We know the truth.	Míenya nyateƒea.
But not for each other.	Gake menye na wo nɔewo o.
Never tried it myself.	Nye ŋutɔ medze agbagba kpɔ o.
If anyone helps me out.	Ne ame aɖe kpe ɖe ŋunye medo go.
But his heart wasn’t in it.	Gake eƒe dzi menɔ eme o.
But you did it.	Gake wòe wɔe.
I was introducing myself.	Menɔ ɖokuinye ɖem fia.
There is a flaw in it.	Vodada aɖe le eŋu.
He had just enough money to get home.	Ga si sɔ gbɔ koe nɔ esi be wòate ŋu aɖo aƒeme.
Its like the place these things are in order.	Eƒe abe teƒe si nu siawo le la le ɖoɖo nu.
It is true here.	Ele eme le afisia.
Someone will come.	Ame aɖe ava.
Something is gone and something else is there in its place.	Nane dzo eye nu bubu aɖe hã le afima ɖe eteƒe.
Many did it very quickly.	Ame geɖe wɔe kaba ŋutɔ.
This has changed.	Esia trɔ.
I had a great idea.	Susu gã aɖe nɔ asinye.
That’s very personal.	Ema nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ ŋutɔ.
I want to work for you.	Medi be mawɔ dɔ na wò.
He might do the exact opposite.	Ðewohĩ awɔ nusi to vovo kura na ema.
Very angry with him.	Do dziku ŋutɔ.
No one can make you.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ wò o.
I think he would love it.	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
But come to think of it.	Gake va bu eŋu kpɔ.
And he's working on it for once.	Eye ele dɔ wɔm tso eŋu zi ɖeka.
Few came to protest.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe va tsɔ tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
He couldn’t hold his head up.	Mete ŋu lé ta ɖe dzi o.
There was nothing.	Naneke menɔ anyi o.
He is a background character.	Enye ame si ƒe nɔnɔme le megbe.
It will definitely be useful.	Aɖe vi godoo.
This is very new to me.	Esia nye nu yeye ŋutɔ nam.
I said one of us needed to do something.	Megblɔ be ehiã be mía dometɔ ɖeka nawɔ nane.
Other than that, there is no issue.	Ne menye nenema o la, nya aɖeke meli o.
No one believed them.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ wo dzi se o.
Not sure how to achieve this.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi mawɔ aɖo esia gbɔ dzi o.
Hold on tightly.	Lé eŋu sesĩe.
Work.	Dɔ.
Or maybe it’s just me.	Alo ɖewohĩ nye koe.
There were two rooms in it.	Xɔ eve nɔ eme.
At least in my mind.	Le nye susu me ya teti.
A kind of alcoholic beverage.	Aha sesẽ ƒomevi aɖe.
I like that part of it.	Akpa ma dzɔa dzi nam.
We must do something, and hurry!	Ele be míawɔ nane, eye míawɔ kaba!
And I’ll do it.	Na mawɔe.
It was the first time he had done it.	Enye zi gbãtɔ si wòwɔ.
I created that moment.	Nyee wɔ ɣeyiɣi ma.
The blood	Ʋua
He lost his job.	Dɔ ge le esi.
These houses are in a good location.	Aƒe siawo nɔa teƒe nyui aɖe.
I have no problem with them.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ŋunye le wo ŋu o.
The day is ahead of you.	Ŋkeke la do ŋgɔ na wò.
This is a very nice car.	Esia nye ʋu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Clearly, too.	Eme kɔ, eya hã.
I never had a dog.	Avu aɖeke menɔ asinye kpɔ o.
That’s a tough one.	Ema nye nya sesẽ aɖe.
He came alone.	Eya ɖeka koe va.
I knew he would.	Menya be awɔe.
But this doesn’t seem to be the case.	Gake edze abe esia mele alea o ene.
I liked him very, very much.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
Now they will all be apart.	Fifia la, wo katã ava nɔ wo nɔewo dome.
After that, my own death didn’t matter either.	Le ema megbe la, nye ŋutɔ nye ku hã meɖe vi aɖeke o.
He put them in writing.	Etsɔ wo de agbalẽ me.
It’s a bad thing.	Enye nu gbegblẽ.
Think about it carefully.	Bu eŋu nyuie.
It’s never been a part of my life.	Menye nye agbe ƒe akpa aɖeke kpɔ o.
And of course, with.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, kple.
I have nowhere to go.	Afi aɖeke meli mayi o.
I want to do two this year.	Medi be mawɔ eve le ƒe sia me.
A normal life is no life at all.	Agbe si sɔ menye agbe kura o.
I never knew so much about myself.	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso ɖokuinye ŋu nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
He couldn’t step away.	Mete ŋu ɖe afɔ ɖa o.
Some people are usually very happy.	Zi geɖe la, ame aɖewo kpɔa dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
But it doesn’t matter now.	Gake mehiã fifia o.
It just doesn’t work in this day and age.	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ le ŋkeke sia me le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
And he knows nothing now.	Eye menya naneke fifia o.
That always works for me.	Ema wɔa dɔ nam ɣesiaɣi.
I never touched it.	Nyemeka asi eŋu kpɔ o.
The damage affected many homes.	Nusi gblẽ le eŋu la gblẽ nu le aƒe geɖe ŋu.
It had worked well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie kpɔ.
I know the right man.	Menya ŋutsu si sɔ.
He has his own house.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe aƒe le esi.
This is about you and me now.	Esia ku ɖe mía kple wò ŋu azɔ.
But something else is wrong.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã gblẽ.
We cannot allow that.	Míate ŋu aɖe mɔ nenema o.
You have enough of it.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ le asiwò.
No money is needed.	Ga aɖeke mehiã o.
Everyone has to do their part.	Ele be ame sia ame nawɔ eƒe akpa dzi.
Now consider the nature of a reality.	Azɔ bu nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe ƒe nɔnɔme ŋu kpɔ.
There is no name for it.	Ŋkɔ aɖeke mele eŋu o.
But he couldn’t go back.	Gake mete ŋu trɔ yi megbe o.
Which is good for me.	Nusi nyo nam.
There was always someone in the room with him.	Ame aɖe nɔa xɔa me kplii ɣesiaɣi.
But on one condition.	Gake le nɔnɔme ɖeka nu.
That’s a big part.	Ema nye akpa gã aɖe.
On the present section.	Le akpa si li fifia ŋu.
That’s divided into four parts.	Emae ɖe akpa ene me.
It will take time to get there.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi hafi aɖo afima.
There’s nothing for us there.	Naneke meli na mí le afima o.
And there are many reasons for this.	Eye susu geɖe li siwo tae wòle alea ɖo.
The person in the background looked like a police car.	Ame si le megbe la nɔ abe kpovitɔwo ƒe ʋu ene.
But no one does everything.	Gake ame aɖeke meli si wɔa nusianu o.
It will be his last week.	Anye eƒe kwasiɖa mamlɛtɔ.
But obviously it’s not quite as simple as that.	Gake edze ƒã be mele bɔbɔe abe ema ene kura o.
It’s absolutely amazing.	Ewɔ nuku kura.
And he was running alone down a road.	Eye eya ɖeka nɔ du dzi to mɔ aɖe dzi.
That really turned off my mind for some reason.	Ema tsi nye susu ŋutɔŋutɔ le susu aɖewo ta.
I'm sorry, but	Meɖe kuku, gake .
But there is one condition.	Gake nɔnɔme ɖeka aɖe li.
No one can beat us.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu aƒo mí o.
I am working through it.	Mele dɔ wɔm le eŋu to eme.
Ele to the ge.	Ele ku ge.
That’s what it is.	Emae nye ema.
Life is contradictory.	Agbe tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
But little is known about it.	Gake nu boo aɖeke menya nu tso eŋu o.
But we know the water.	Gake míenya tsi.
I was like the extra guy.	Menɔ abe ŋutsu si kpe ɖe eŋu ene.
This seems to be very important to him.	Edze abe esia le vevie nɛ ŋutɔ ene.
The wonderful place.	Teƒe si wɔ nuku la.
I just wanted to get out of there.	Ðeko medi be mado le afima.
Not by much.	Menye to nu geɖe dzi o.
My hair was wet with sweat.	Nye ɖa ƒo tsi le fifia ta.
He looked at them himself.	Eya ŋutɔ lé ŋku ɖe wo ŋu.
This is working well.	Esia le dɔ wɔm nyuie.
If there are any mistakes, you can see them live.	Ne vodada aɖewo li la, àte ŋu akpɔ wo le agbe.
I would rather do this than anything.	Anyo nam wu be mawɔ esia wu nusianu.
I really hope he does well.	Mele mɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ be awɔe nyuie.
Four has been nothing but good all year.	Ene menye naneke wu nyui le ƒe bliboa me o.
And things are lost.	Eye nuwo bu.
Since this is just the first of many.	Esi wònye be esia nye gbãtɔ ko le ame geɖe dome ta.
The man next door would do the same.	Ŋutsu si te ɖe mía ŋu hã awɔ nu ma ke.
That was two years ago.	Ema nye ƒe eve enye sia.
I resisted it.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu.
I am here for the first time.	Mele afisia zi gbãtɔ.
There could be several reasons for this.	Susu geɖe ate ŋu anɔ esia ta.
None of them worked.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ dɔ o.
Its very curious, something is different.	Eƒe didi ŋutɔ, nane nye nusi to vovo.
Not in that month.	Menye ɣleti ma me o.
We know absolutely nothing about it.	Míenya naneke kura tso eŋu o.
That’s just the first step.	Afɔ gbãtɔ koe nye ema.
He tried that morning.	Edze agbagba ŋdi ma.
And there wasn’t one.	Eye ɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I expected him not to stay.	Mekpɔ mɔ be manɔ anyi o.
That counts for a lot.	Ema le vevie na nane geɖe.
I have my own house.	Nye ŋutɔ nye aƒe le asinye.
Two words for you.	Nya eve na wò.
On the same day.	Le ŋkeke ma ke dzi.
Like, really resist.	Abe, tsi tre ɖe eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
Each one touches my heart.	Wo dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe wɔa dɔ ɖe nye dzi dzi.
Ask for this job.	Bia dɔ sia wɔwɔ.
As none of it is real.	Abe alesi wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o ene.
Let’s try it.	Na míate kpɔ.
Things will be great.	Nuwo anyo ŋutɔ.
Go ahead, go ahead.	Do go, do go.
But he didn’t, he never could.	Gake mewɔe o, mete ŋui gbeɖe o.
Please help me explain.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye maɖe eme.
I could be wrong about that.	Mate ŋu anye vodada le nya ma ŋu.
Stay away from that dog.	Te ɖa le avu ma ŋu.
There are no teeth.	Aɖu aɖeke meli o.
That was a good day.	Ema nye ŋkeke nyui aɖe.
It’s very clear.	Eme kɔ ŋutɔ.
But there is something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã li.
I’ve been here before.	Meva afisia kpɔ.
Let’s get something done.	Mina míawɔ nu.
No one knows where they are.	Ame aɖeke menya afisi wole o.
It’s like you’re actually there.	Ðeko wòle abe ɖe nèle afima ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
But enough is enough.	Gake nusi sɔ gbɔ la sɔ gbɔ.
All he did was right.	Nusi wòwɔ koe nye nu si sɔ.
Some of us are trying to do something.	Mía dometɔ aɖewo le agbagba dzem be míawɔ nane.
I am not sure what you are trying to do here.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi nèle agbagba dzem be yeawɔ le afisia dzi o.
So we know nothing about them.	Eya ta míenya naneke tso wo ŋu o.
This is very small.	Esia le sue ŋutɔ.
But he couldn’t do it himself.	Gake eya ŋutɔ mete ŋu wɔe o.
He had never done it in his life.	Mewɔe le eƒe agbe me kpɔ o.
He felt no joy in it.	Mese le eɖokui me be dzidzɔ aɖeke mele eme o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It’s a simple truth.	Enye nyateƒe bɔbɔe aɖe.
I can’t stand it either.	Nye ke hã mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu o.
It will take some time.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
So is everyone else.	Nenema ke ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã le.
There is no other possibility.	Nu bubu aɖeke meli si ate ŋu adzɔ o.
I doubt it will be a good thing.	Meke ɖi be anye nu nyui aɖe.
I think in the long run that works against you.	Mesusu be le ɣeyiɣi didi me la, ema wɔa dɔ ɖe ŋuwò.

Two more.	Eve bubu.
I'm sure I need to do that.	Meka ɖe edzi be ehiã be mawɔe nenema.
But there is a problem with it.	Gake kuxi aɖe le eŋu.
Some of them were armed.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo tsɔ tu ɖe asi.
Still, he was tired.	Ke hã, ɖeɖi te eŋu.
None of these things are bad in any way.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke menye nu gbegblẽ le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
It made no sense to me.	Susu aɖeke menɔ eŋu nam o.
You almost have to plan for that.	Ele be nàwɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ema ŋu kloe.
If there is only one thing, you don’t have to do anything.	Ne nu ɖeka koe li la, mehiã be nàwɔ naneke o.

It was one o’clock in the afternoon.	Ŋdɔ ga ɖekae.
I just didn’t really know what he was doing.	Ðeko nyemenya nusi tututu wɔm wònɔ o.
But he couldn’t see anything.	Gake mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
Ask behind your back.	Bia le wò megbe.
There was something else about it.	Nu bubu aɖe nɔ eŋu.
I don’t know where he is.	Nyemenya afi si wòle o.
The car didn’t matter now.	Ʋua menɔ vevie fifia o.
Not too big of a deal.	Menye gã akpa o.
I was already nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe xoxo.

Obviously it would have been.	Edze ƒã be anye ne anɔ eme.
He could never prove them .	Mete ŋu ɖo kpe wo dzi gbeɖe o .

There is nothing more complicated than that.	Naneke meli si sesẽ wu ema o.
We didn’t have room for this either.	Teƒe menɔ mía si na esia hã o.
A great person like that.	Ame gã aɖe abe ema ene.
There must have been a strategy.	Aɖaŋu aɖe anya nɔ anyi.
I think anything is possible.	Mesusu be nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
I congratulated everyone.	Medo dzidzɔ na amewo katã.
What if it doesn’t matter now.	Ke nenye be mehiã fifia o ɖe.
He wasn’t so sure.	Meka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o.
Some came late.	Ame aɖewo va tsi megbe.
I want to stay focused.	Medi be nye susu nanɔ nu ŋu.
Her clear voice is amazing.	Eƒe gbe si me kɔ la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It will eventually be someone else.	Anye ame bubu mlɔeba.
The past year has been a very, very long road.	Ƒe si va yi nye mɔ didi aɖe ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
A week later.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka megbe.
Thanks for any help regarding this.	Akpe na mi ɖe kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe si ku ɖe esia ŋu ta.
His head was down.	Eƒe ta nɔ anyi.
This would also be wrong.	Esia hã anye nu gbegblẽ.
There was no time for that.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi na ema o.
I got a job, sort of.	Mexɔ dɔ, ƒomevi aɖe.
I wanted the exact opposite.	Medi nusi to vovo na ema tututu.
He didn’t feel like anything.	Mese le eɖokui me be naneke o.
Two of them stayed behind.	Wo dometɔ eve tsi megbe.
In this case, there is none.	Le go sia me la, ɖeke meli o.
As a result, many people lost their jobs.	Esia wɔe be dɔ ge le ame geɖe si.
Please enter your name here.	Taflatse ŋlɔ wò ŋkɔ ɖe afisia.
I know that all too well.	Menya nya ma nyuie ale gbegbe.
If you can help out.	Ne àte ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu.
His own may be coming soon.	Ðewohĩ eya ŋutɔ tɔ ava kpuie.
That only means one thing.	Nu ɖeka koe ema fia.
That’s a real problem right now.	Ema nye kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ fifia.
There should have been more.	Ðe wòle be nu geɖe wu nanɔ anyi hafi.
You can overcome them.	Àte ŋu aɖu wo dzi.
We are not waiting.	Menye ɖe míele lalam o.
He fell backwards.	Edze anyi ɖe megbe.
He was obviously tired.	Edze ƒã be ɖeɖi te eŋu.
So far, he has done the same.	Vaseɖe fifia la, eya hã wɔe nenema.
A fresh breeze filled the room.	Ya yeye aɖe ƒo ɖe xɔa me.
I remember being tired.	Meɖo ŋku edzi be ɖeɖi te ŋunye.
Or maybe there was something.	Alo ɖewohĩ nane nɔ anyi.
They seem to be.	Edze abe wole nenema ene.
More balanced people in that role.	Ame siwo da sɔ wu le akpa ma me.
Maybe that’s why.	Ðewohĩ ema tae.
We can do something about it.	Míate ŋu awɔ nane tso eŋu.
One of his own.	Eya ŋutɔ tɔ ɖeka.
It might have been nice to hear more about it.	Ðewohĩ anyo ŋutɔ be mese nu geɖe tso eŋu hafi.
We have what we deserve.	Nusi dze na mí la le mía si.
He will find someone new.	Akpɔ ame yeye aɖe.
And not in a good way.	Eye menye le mɔ nyui aɖe nu o.
I don’t know, I don’t want to know.	Nyemenya o, nyemedi be manya o.
I am fine with this.	Mele nyuie le esia ŋu.
Not you, obviously.	Menye wòe o, edze ƒã.
This solves a big problem.	Esia kpɔa kuxi gã aɖe gbɔ.
This is not a new phenomenon.	Esia menye nu yeye o.
It wasn’t too late.	Metsi megbe akpa o.
That was a difficult task.	Dɔ sesẽ aɖee nye ema.
I needed to shower or bathe.	Ehiã be maɖe tsi alo ale tsi.
What do you think we can do?	Nukae nèsusu be míate ŋu awɔ?
Stay tuned for us.	Kpɔ mɔ na mí.
Or anyone else, for that matter.	Alo ame bubu ɖesiaɖe, le nya ma ta.
Everything is expensive, yet no one has a good job.	Nusianu xɔ asi, ke hã dɔ nyui aɖeke mele ame aɖeke si o.
It is so true.	Enye nyateƒe ale gbegbe.
Same reason, actually.	Susu ma ke, le nyateƒe me.
In the next two weeks.	Le kwasiɖa eve siwo gbɔna me.
After that, everything works.	Le ema megbe la, nusianu wɔa dɔ.
You can actually do it.	Àte ŋui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Let him do us a favor.	Na wòawɔ nu nyui aɖe na mí.
It wasn’t in it.	Menɔ eme o.
Or any house.	Alo aƒe ɖesiaɖe.
However, there is still some room for error here.	Gake vodada ƒe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ li le afisia.
I just joined him to do something.	Ðeko mewɔ ɖeka kplii be mawɔ nane.
It was a surprise to many.	Ewɔ nuku na ame geɖe ŋutɔ.
I promised to treat people well.	Medo ŋugbe be mawɔ nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu nyuie.
I wasn’t in charge of that.	Menye nyee nɔ ema dzi kpɔm o.
I think it could solve a problem or two.	Mesusu be ate ŋu akpɔ kuxi ɖeka alo eve gbɔ.
And thinking about it more.	Eye eŋu bubu geɖe wu.
I felt it in myself.	Mese le ɖokuinye me.
You are not looking for help.	Menye kpekpeɖeŋu dim nèle o.
I hope we have a great time.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe anɔ mía si.
Some people were excited.	Dzi dzɔ ame aɖewo.
Just because he can.	Esi wòate ŋui ta ko.
By very little too.	To vie ŋutɔ hã dzi.
Who is he, anyway? 	Amekae wònye?
And we have them.	Eye wo le mía si.
I think you will enjoy it.	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò.
Each represents its own era.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe tsi tre ɖi na eya ŋutɔ ƒe ɣeyiɣi.
Among my people.	Le nye amewo dome.
It was kind of clear to me in the past.	Eme kɔ nam le mɔ aɖe nu va yi.
My heart gave up on him.	Nye dzi ɖe asi le eŋu.
There is nothing there.	Naneke mele afima o.
If you like anything here, please let me know.	Ne nane dze ŋuwò le afisia la, taflatse na manya.
Nothing is necessary.	Nu aɖeke mehiã o.
He sued me.	Etsɔ nya ɖe ŋunye.
In the meantime, and if we have to do anything.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, eye ne ele be míawɔ nane hã.
Maybe it was a dog.	Ðewohĩ avu aɖee.
Again, the work has begun in earnest.	Le afisia hã la, dɔa dze egɔme vevie.
Work on that.	Wɔ dɔ tso ema ŋu.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
He was very dedicated to the project.	Etsɔ eɖokui na ŋutɔ ɖe dɔa ŋu.
This costs a lot of money.	Esia xɔa ga geɖe.
He didn’t seem to have any.	Edze abe ɖeke menɔ esi o ene.
That’s probably enough.	Anɔ eme be ema sɔ gbɔ.
Take a closer look at your work.	Lé ŋku ɖe wò dɔa ŋu nyuie.
He couldn’t see anyone.	Mete ŋu kpɔ ame aɖeke o.
He seemed unsure of what to do.	Edze abe meka ɖe nusi wòawɔ dzi o ene.
But again, who knows.	Gake le afisia hã la, amekae nya.
Some of them laughed at him.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo ko nu nɛ.
I would be very happy.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
This time things will be different.	Fifia ya nuwo ava to vovo.
Two books in a year.	Agbalẽ eve le ƒe ɖeka me.
The lie is hard work.	Alakpa la nye dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ.
Keep up the good work.	Yi dɔ nyui la dzi.
It’s the same as everyone else.	Nenema ke wòle abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
Make plans for it now.	Wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu fifia.
Add this to any beverage of your choice.	Tsɔ esia kpe ɖe aha ɖesiaɖe si nèdi ŋu.
He didn’t understand.	Mese egɔme o.
I know that it is.	Menya be ele eme.
When the matter is received.	Ne nya la xɔ.
I’m here to talk about me.	Meva afisia be maƒo nu tso ŋunye.
And he never makes a mistake.	Eye mewɔa vodada gbeɖe o.
Use a real man.	Zã ŋutsu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There is no reason here.	Susu aɖeke mele afisia o.
It’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
He will just do it.	Ðeko wòawɔ ɖe edzi.
But that’s only so far.	Gake vaseɖe fifia koe nye ema.
I let this happen.	Meɖe mɔ esia dzɔ.
Not before, and not after at all.	Menye do ŋgɔ o, eye menye le ema megbe kura o.
I can’t seem to do this.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu awɔ esia o ene.
This is different.	Esia to vovo.
Keeping things in order.	Nuwo wɔwɔ ɖe ɖoɖo nu.
It could have happened.	Ate ŋu adzɔ hafi.
We’ve been apart for two hours.	Míele mía nɔewo gbɔ gaƒoƒo eve enye sia.
That was a bad idea for me.	Ema nye susu gbegblẽ aɖe nam.
Perhaps after his death.	Ðewohĩ le eƒe ku megbe.
Two very different kinds of work are needed here.	Dɔ ƒomevi eve siwo to vovo kura hiã le afisia.
He needs a car very soon.	Ehiã ʋu aɖe kpuie ŋutɔ.
But I wasn’t too surprised.	Gake mewɔ nuku nam akpa o.
Maybe I’ll like this.	Ðewohĩ esia adzɔ dzi nam.
In short, no one knows your name.	Kpuie ko la, ame aɖeke menya wò ŋkɔ o.
You can help me here.	Àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye le afisia.
That is a serious possibility.	Ema nye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ vevie.
He didn’t see anyone else.	Mekpɔ ame bubu aɖeke o.
It wasn’t very easy before.	Menɔ bɔbɔe tututu tsã o.
People who were different entered.	Ame siwo to vovo la ge ɖe eme.
And you’re here, too.	Eye wò hã nèle afisia.
Contact us today.	Te ɖe mía ŋu egbea.
I can definitely see that.	Mete ŋu kpɔa ema godoo.
He has no idea of ​​tomorrow.	Etsɔ ƒe susu aɖeke mele esi o.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Nyemenya nusi adzɔ o.
He is not enjoying himself.	Mele dzidzɔ kpɔm o.
Write about me.	Ŋlɔ nu tso ŋunye.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
I am really really like that.	Mele nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He worked hard.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe.
Do what you have to do.	Wɔ nusi wòle be nàwɔ.
It will always be a lost cause.	Anye dɔ si bu ɣesiaɣi.
I had no idea and that made me nervous.	Nyemenya naneke o eye ema na metsi dzodzodzoe.
You can easily understand them manually.	Àte ŋu ase wo gɔme bɔbɔe kple asi.
That can’t be true!	Ema mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o!
Nothing can surprise me now.	Naneke mate ŋu awɔ nuku nam fifia o.
Things will never be the same.	Nuwo manɔ abe tsã ene gbeɖe o.
There really is no other way.	Le nyateƒe me la, mɔ bubu aɖeke meli o.
He had a word for me.	Nya aɖe nɔ esi nam.
Not now, his face said.	Menye fifia o, eƒe mo gblɔ.
You might say that.	Àte ŋu agblɔ be.
And now there is no food in the house.	Eye fifia nuɖuɖu aɖeke mele aƒea me o.
I can’t be mad at me.	Nyemate ŋu ado dziku ɖe ŋunye o.
I spoke my mind and myself with food.	Megblɔ nye susu kple nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye kple nuɖuɖu.
This can happen very easily.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
He is very busy now.	Ele dɔ dzi vevie fifia.
I just don’t think he really believes it.	Ðeko mesusu be mexɔ edzi se ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He will hear the word.	Ase nya la.
There are too many people.	Amewo sɔ gbɔ akpa.
It’s true and it’s not true.	Enye nyateƒe eye menye nyateƒe o.
We can put the matter this way.	Míate ŋu agblɔ nya la alea.
Greet everyone in the room.	Do gbe na amesiame si le xɔa me.
It’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
That is impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
For a very long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
But by all means.	Gake to mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I wasn’t sure it would work.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be awɔ dɔ o.
There was blood on it too.	Ʋu nɔ edzi hã.
A car came by.	Ʋu aɖe va to afima.
A little is right, not much.	Vi aɖe koe sɔ, nu geɖe mele nenema o.
It was a first for me.	Enye gbãtɔ nam.
The day that changed my whole life.	Ŋkeke si trɔ nye agbe bliboa.
But there’s still a small part of me.	Gake nye akpa sue aɖe gakpɔtɔ li kokoko.
Tell him what we know so far.	Gblɔ nusi míenya vaseɖe fifia nɛ.
This is exciting.	Esia doa dzidzɔ na ame.
Part of it, anyway!.	Eƒe akpa aɖe, le mɔ sia mɔ nu!.
Few people know this.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nya esia.
This year is no exception.	Ƒe sia hã mele eme o.
And you are right.	Eye wò nya le eteƒe.
He is a very independent person.	Enye ame si le eɖokui si ŋutɔ.
I told him something was wrong.	Megblɔ nɛ be nane gblẽ le eŋu.
Add the water to it.	Tsɔ tsi la de eme.
A person or thing that.	Ame alo nu si.
Not one person at a time.	Menye ame ɖeka ɖeka o.
I want to work on it.	Medi be mawɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
The city is many things.	Du la nye nu geɖe.
One thousand a week.	Akpe ɖeka le kwasiɖa me.
It’s the same for everyone.	Enye ɖeka na amesiame.
He never got any of it either.	Mexɔ eƒe ɖe hã kpɔ o.
No one was really talking about it.	Ame aɖeke menɔ nu ƒom tso eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Water is necessary for life.	Tsi hiã na agbe.
The process took longer than he expected.	Dɔa xɔ ɣeyiɣi didi wu alesi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ.
I have a meal.	Nuɖuɖu aɖe le asinye.
He wasn’t ready.	Menɔ klalo o.
But there is actually a problem.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, kuxi aɖe li.
Few people had these skills.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe si aɖaŋu siawo nɔ.
In a way, you.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, wò.
You are making better money now.	Èle ga si nyo wu kpɔm fifia.
An opportunity that came with an element of surprise.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ si va kple nusi wɔ nuku ƒe akpa aɖe.
Longevity that matters.	Agbe didi si le vevie.
Definitely check them out.	Kpɔ wo ɖa godoo.
Arise, arise!	Tso, tso!
But I have to do that.	Gake ele be mawɔe nenema.
Life is good between them now.	Agbe nyo le wo dome fifia.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I think that’s me.	Mesusu be nyee nye ema.
No one will do it.	Ame aɖeke mawɔe o.
We can’t live with it.	Míate ŋu anɔ agbe o.
And it still existed.	Eye wònɔ anyi kokoko.
Two men are looking for you this morning.	Ŋutsu eve le wò dim ŋdi sia.
This can happen to anyone.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ na amesiame.
But be careful when you go down that road.	Gake kpɔ nyuie ne èle mɔ ma dzi yim.
It can go further than that.	Ate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu ema.
Each one is different.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
There is nothing to do.	Naneke meli woawɔ o.
I don’t mean to suggest.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mado susu ɖa o.
You can eat and do anything.	Àte ŋu aɖu nu anɔ nusianu wɔm.
He didn’t ask any questions.	Mebia nya aɖeke o.
There was this other person.	Ame bubu sia hã nɔ anyi.
That’s all true.	Ema katã nye nyateƒe.
I promise you this.	Medo esia ƒe ŋugbe na mi.
It will last for months.	Anɔ anyi ɣleti geɖe.
It worked out very well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
No one would be in that situation.	Ame aɖeke manɔ nɔnɔme ma me o.
We have lost a great deal.	Nu gã aɖe bu na mí.
It’s too easy for them.	Ele bɔbɔe na wo akpa.
That’s nothing.	Ema menye naneke o.
And he didn’t expect that to happen.	Eye menɔ mɔ kpɔm be nu ma ava eme o.
Other than that, it did nothing.	Ne menye nenema o la, mewɔ naneke o.
Be careful what you wish for!	Kpɔ nyuie le nusi nèdi ŋu!
Let them fuck.	Na woawɔ fu.
That’s good for you.	Ema nyo na wò.
I just couldn’t get over them.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ɖu wo dzi o.
That will tell you a lot.	Ema agblɔ nu geɖe na wò.
He is committed to this project over a long period of time.	Etsɔ eɖokui na be yeawɔ dɔ sia le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe me.
I'm standing there.	Ke le eme.
A huge fire broke out.	Dzo gã aɖe do.
You can easily do this at home.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia bɔbɔe le aƒeme.
Only you can answer that question.	Wò ɖeka koe ate ŋu aɖo nya ma ŋu.
Help for today.	Kpekpeɖeŋu na egbea.
Raise your voice.	Do wò gbe ɖe dzi.
But not here, and not now.	Gake menye le afisia o, eye menye fifia hã o.
Now please just trust me.	Azɔ taflatse ka ɖe dzinye ko.
Some great ship design.	Meli ƒe nɔnɔme gã aɖewo.
We are very busy these days.	Vovo mele mía ŋu kura le ŋkeke siawo me o.
Or bad for you.	Alo nu gbegblẽ na wò.
These kids don’t seem to be happy at all.	Edze abe ɖevi siawo mekpɔ dzidzɔ kura o ene.
There were exceptions.	Ame aɖewo nɔ anyi siwo to vovo.
He didn’t know if he could do it.	Menya nenye be yeate ŋu awɔe o.
None of them did anything.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ naneke o.
That is very possible.	Ema anya wɔ ŋutɔ.
Almost there, now.	Afima kloe, fifia.
It was a tough first year out on my own.	Enye ƒe gbãtɔ sesẽ aɖe si medo go le ɖokuinye si.
I asked to go every year.	Mebia be mayi ƒe sia ƒe.
I had a small part.	Akpa sue aɖe nɔ asinye.
The self is the only thing.	Ame ŋutɔ koe nye nu ɖeka.
There are no two ways about that.	Mɔ eve aɖeke meli le ema ŋu o.
But, it's not working for me.	Gake, mele dɔ wɔm nam o.
He did everything.	Ewɔ nusianu.
There are very few jobs now.	Dɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe li fifia.
That used to be a reality.	Ema nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ tsã.
Everything seemed normal.	Edze abe nusianu sɔ ene.
That was a good time.	Ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖee nye ema.
Look at it there!	Kpɔ afima ɖa!
Which it definitely is .	Nusi wònye godoo .
The same was true of the matter.	Nya la hã nɔ nenema.
Some people live by these words.	Ame aɖewo kpɔa agbe le nya siawo nu.
That it’s a bad thing.	Be enye nu gbegblẽ.
Something is definitely wrong.	Nane gblẽ godoo.
It was a man.	Ŋutsu aɖee.
So he could not speak or write the truth.	Eya ta mete ŋu ƒo nu alo ŋlɔ nyateƒea o.
That was a huge mistake.	Ema nye vodada gã aɖe.
, which is in a state of .	, si le nɔnɔme aɖe me .
He wouldn’t let it surprise him.	Maɖe mɔ wòawɔ nuku nɛ o.
That seems possible in any case.	Edze abe ema anya wɔ le nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe me ene.
That's why.	Ema tae.
But he won’t be there.	Gake manɔ afima o.
I can’t do anything.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu o.
I am still questioning them myself.	Nye ŋutɔ megale nya biam wo kokoko.
He is the same person.	Eya hã nye ame ma ke.
I really enjoyed that.	Ema dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I don’t think it will last long.	Nyemesusu be axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi o.
That’s a very good thing.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ.
That’s the weirdest part of his job.	Emae nye eƒe dɔa ƒe akpa si wɔ nuku wu.
We can’t escape.	Míate ŋu asi o.
Now, he had someone.	Fifia, ame aɖe nɔ esi.
There seems to be more waiting.	Edze abe wole lalam geɖe wu ene.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I love the design of this house.	Aƒe sia ƒe nɔnɔme dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
The work began quickly.	Dɔa dze egɔme kaba.
There was so much to do.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi woawɔ.
There is no time limit.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli o.
Not so much overall, you guys do you a lot of good.	Menye nenema gbegbe le nusianu me la, mi amewo wɔa nyui geɖe na mi o.
Keep it up!.	Yi edzi nenema!.
There is no reason for it!	Susu aɖeke mele eŋu o!
I had to try this route this time.	Ele be mate mɔ sia dzi zi sia.
It didn’t help him.	Meɖe vi aɖeke nɛ o.
That annoyed me.	Ema do dziku nam.
No problems arose.	Kuxi aɖeke medo mo ɖa o.
It was a pleasure to meet you.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò.
I guess that's the one anyway.	Mesusu be emae nye ɖeka le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Write them down.	Ŋlɔ wo ɖi.
And this other thing.	Eye nu bubu sia hã.
Someone has to do things.	Ele be ame aɖe nawɔ nuwo.
The money should still be there.	Ele be ga la nanɔ afima kokoko.
Come on, here take this.	Va, afisia tsɔ esia.
His job suited him well.	Eƒe dɔa sɔ nɛ nyuie.
He's not doing anything.	Menye naneke wɔm wòle o.
However, this should not be the case.	Ke hã, mele be esia nanɔ nenema o.
You can see a lot of things that are new now.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe siwo nye nu yeye fifia.
The meeting was important to his work.	Kpekpea nɔ vevie na eƒe dɔa.
Which is not a good thing.	Nusi menye nu nyui aɖeke o.
I am going to change this.	Mele esia trɔ ge.
It’s a different thing.	Enye nusi to vovo.
Find one that suits you best.	Di ɖeka si sɔ na wò wu.
Please let me know what you think about that.	Taflatse na manya wò susu le nya ma ŋu.
This is not inconsistent.	Esia menye nusi mewɔ ɖeka o.
I know you through it.	Menya wò to eme.
I ask his name.	Mebiaa eƒe ŋkɔ.
He will understand.	Ase egɔme.
Let’s do something a little more normal.	Mina míawɔ nane si sɔ gbɔ vie wu.
It’s a problem.	Enye kuxi aɖe.
I was satisfied.	Nye dzi dze eme.
That’s a good news.	Nya nyuie wònye.
And there is something else.	Eye nu bubu aɖe hã li.
Couldn’t be happier.	Mate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ wu ema o.
And we have almost no time.	Eye ɣeyiɣi aɖeke mele mía si kloe o.
And if anything, the job was a little easier.	Eye ne nane li la, dɔa nɔ bɔbɔe vie.
Unfamiliar faces worried him.	Mo siwo menya o la tsi dzi ɖe eŋu.
And a very interesting ‘lot’ in that.	Eye ‘nu geɖe’ si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ le ema me.
That’s not realistic.	Ema menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I made two exceptions.	Mewɔ eve siwo to vovo.
He no longer has a job.	Dɔ megale esi o.
Yet it is not.	Ke hã mele nenema o.
This period is usually very short.	Zi geɖe la, ɣeyiɣi sia nɔa kpuie ŋutɔ.
No one will ever know about this.	Ame aɖeke manya nu tso nya sia ŋu gbeɖe o.
There used to be something.	Nane nɔ anyi tsã.
Everyone lent a hand.	Amesiame do asi na ame.
There is no good person.	Ame nyui aɖeke meli o.
That was his first mistake.	Emae nye eƒe vodada gbãtɔ.
That means this issue is going to be expensive.	Ema fia be nya sia ava xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Again, it’s the same idea.	Le afisia hã la, enye susu ma ke.
But it’s not exactly what you want.	Gake menye nusi tututu nèdi o.
A year that will live in infamy.	Ƒe si anɔ agbe le ŋkɔ gbegblẽ me.
Some of them will be like that.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo anɔ nenema.
It makes some sense in some respects.	Susu le eme vie le go aɖewo me.
I doubt anyone would.	Meke ɖi be ame aɖe awɔe nenema.
I heard what you did.	Mese nu si nèwɔ.
Anything else that can kill you still can.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe si ate ŋu awu wò la ate ŋu awɔe kokoko.
You have more skills.	Aɖaŋu geɖe wu le asiwò.
Hold on to this water.	Lé tsi sia ɖe te.
The way of the law.	Se la ƒe mɔ.
We just had something.	Ðeko nane nɔ mía si.
I want to do it.	Medi be mawɔe.
Everything was ready.	Nusianu nɔ klalo.
Which is very surprising.	Nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Now he needs time to himself.	Fifia la, ehiã ɣeyiɣi na eɖokui.
He was not happy with his life at all.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eƒe agbe ŋu kura o.
Wish him well in every thought you have of him.	Di nyui nɛ le wò susu ɖe sia ɖe me le eŋu me.
The meeting failed to reach any conclusions.	Kpekpea mete ŋu ƒo nya ta aɖeke o.
Take another one, too.	Tsɔ bubu hã.
That must have surprised people.	Ema anya wɔ nuku na amewo.
Every market is different.	Asi ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
But that didn’t last long.	Gake ema menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
He had done this once before.	Ewɔ esia zi ɖeka do ŋgɔ.
In fact, we barely knew each other.	Le nyateƒe me la, míenya mía nɔewo kura o.
The idea had never occurred to him.	Susu la meva susu me nɛ kpɔ o.
I remember now though.	Meɖo ŋku edzi fifia ya.
We didn’t know what we could find there.	Míenya nusi míate ŋu akpɔ le afima o.
We can work together.	Míate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
Today, no one is trying.	Egbea la, ame aɖeke mele agbagba dzem o.
I can eat anything.	Mate ŋu aɖu nusianu.
One of the men said.	Ŋutsu ɖeka gblɔ be.
What to do with a child.	Nu kae nye si woawɔ ɖe ɖevi ŋu.
This book is amazing.	Agbalẽ sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But I can’t do it.	Gake nyemate ŋui o.
I just want to focus on that.	Ðeko medi be nye susu nanɔ ema ŋu.
That guy’s back.	Ŋutsu ma ƒe megbe.
This may not be possible.	Ðewohĩ esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
He couldn’t finish it.	Mete ŋu wu enu o.
I want that now.	Medi nenema fifia.
That’s the fire.	Emae nye dzo la.
I can’t see normally.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nu le mɔ si sɔ nu o.
This is not necessarily a problem.	Esia menye kuxi kokoko o.
It just didn’t work out.	Ðeko medze edzi o.
Talk about it with someone.	Ƒo nu tso eŋu kple ame aɖe.
He didn’t feel like himself at all.	Mese le eɖokui me abe eya ŋutɔ ene kura o.
It may not be possible.	Ðewohĩ manya wɔ o.
It may not stay that way for long.	Ðewohĩ manɔ nenema ɣeyiɣi didi o.
In my head.	Le nye ta me.
Nothing at all seemed to work.	Edze abe naneke kura mewɔ dɔ o ene.
You can make as much or as little as you want.	Àte ŋu akpɔ ga geɖe alo sue si nèdi.
Like, really hard.	Abe, sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
I have it right here.	Ele asinye le afisia tututu.
This is not his own.	Esia menye eya ŋutɔ tɔ o.
It’s so nice to see you!	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mekpɔ wò!
You can look for them.	Àte ŋu adi wo.
It worked really well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We’re working on things.	Míele dɔ wɔm tso nuwo ŋu.
You would have done the same.	Anye ne wò hã nàwɔ nenema ke.
I gave him my hand.	Metsɔ nye asi nɛ.
We can test that here.	Míate ŋu ado ema kpɔ le afisia.
She may already be pregnant.	Ðewohĩ afɔ fu xoxo.
No one came forward.	Ame aɖeke meva do ɖe ŋgɔ o.
He could not believe what he had done.	Mete ŋu xɔ nusi wòwɔ la dzi se o.
It’s just beautiful.	Ðeko eƒe nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
A little bit of it.	Vi aɖe vie.
And it’s a solid rock.	Eye wònye kpe sesẽ.
And that’s all the point.	Eye nya la koe nye ema.
We hope these posts are useful.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be nya siawo aɖe vi.
Maybe a month or two.	Ðewohĩ ɣleti ɖeka alo eve.
Something must have gone.	Nane anya dzo.
And they have nothing on it.	Eye naneke mele wo si le edzi o.
Try this out.	Te esia kpɔ.
Everyone is so much fun to work with.	Amesiame doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
That didn’t last long.	Ema menɔ anyi didi o.
Which is very good.	Nusi nyo ŋutɔ.
He is looking for a better job.	Ele dɔ si nyo wu dim.
Another building collapsed.	Xɔ bubu aɖe hã dze anyi.
I fell on my face.	Medze anyi ɖe nye mo.
I don’t think they liked it very much.	Nyemesusu be edzɔ dzi na wo ŋutɔ o.
Each of us has a role to play.	Akpa aɖe le mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe si wòawɔ.
I just thought you might like that too.	Ðeko mesusu be ɖewohĩ ema hã adzɔ dzi na wò.
I was all set to go.	Nye katã menɔ klalo be mayi.
I wanted him to do something wrong.	Medi be wòawɔ nu gbegblẽ.
His last book.	Eƒe agbalẽ mamlɛtɔ.
Too many people don’t.	Ame geɖe akpa mewɔa esia o.
Which can’t be.	Nusi mate ŋu anye o.
But it could have happened.	Gake ate ŋu adzɔ hafi.
Something was wrong with the gun.	Nane gblẽ le tu la ŋu.
Everyone knows about it.	Amesiame nya nu tso eŋu.
I know there is more to it than that.	Menya be nu geɖe le eme wu ema.
You have one chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ ɖeka le asiwò.
And go beyond that.	Eye yi ŋgɔ wu ema.
But this is not an easy thing.	Gake esia menye nu bɔbɔe aɖe o.
No help from anyone.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke meli tso ame aɖeke gbɔ o.
Bad place.	Teƒe gbegblẽ.
But he didn’t invest.	Gake metsɔ ga de eme o.
And this has happened in the past.	Eye esia dzɔ va yi.
Something died inside me.	Nane ku le menye.
I hear you have some food for us.	Mese be nuɖuɖu aɖe le asiwò na mí.
He did a very good job.	Ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
No one can say this was a bad death.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu agblɔ be esia nye ku gbegblẽ o.
I need to know these things.	Ele be manya nu siawo.
I can get hot.	Mate ŋu axɔ dzo.
I can’t see anyone here.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ame aɖeke le afisia o.
It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
I had never heard of him.	Nyemese eƒe nya kpɔ o.
I was very impressed with him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ.
A good idea came to him.	Susu nyui aɖe va dze edzi nɛ.
Maybe it’s a good thing.	Ðewohĩ enye nu nyui aɖe.
And we need to do more about that.	Eye ele be míawɔ nu geɖe tso ema ŋu.
This means something is wrong.	Esia fia be nane gblẽ.
I couldn’t understand that.	Nyemete ŋu se nya ma gɔme o.
No one knew who he was or where he was.	Ame aɖeke menya amesi wònye alo afi si wòle o.
This dress is too hard.	Awu sia sesẽ akpa.
Moments when his whole life was still ahead of him.	Ɣeyiɣi siwo me eƒe agbe bliboa gakpɔtɔ nɔ ŋgɔ nɛ.
Winter is the first season.	Dzomeŋɔli ye nye ɣeyiɣi gbãtɔ.
But he wasn’t there.	Gake menɔ afima o.
You’ve done it.	Wòe wɔe.
Four months happened that year.	Ɣleti ene dzɔ le ƒe ma me.
It started out simple.	Edze egɔme le bɔbɔe.
Come in and get inside.	Va ge ɖe eme.
No traffic for nearly two hours.	Ʋu aɖeke mele edzi yim o gaƒoƒo eve kloe enye sia.
He was attracted to people.	Amewo ƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
the dog came out of its hole.	avu la do go tso eƒe do me.
But he didn’t say that.	Gake megblɔ nya ma o.
Not once, of course.	Menye zi ɖeka ya o.
It looks like money.	Edze abe ga ene.
I did it right.	Mewɔe nyuie.
As it might be.	Abe alesi wòate ŋu anɔ ene.
I said no one said.	Megblɔ be ame aɖeke megblɔ o.
I am not expecting this.	Nyemele mɔ kpɔm na esia o.
However, this doesn’t work.	Ke hã, esia mewɔa dɔ o.
He's getting angry.	Ele dziku dom.
But for a good reason.	Gake susu nyui aɖe tae.
The work is very difficult.	Dɔa sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Let’s do this together.	Mina míawɔ esia ɖekae.
This was a long time ago.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe do ŋgɔ.
I could ride with him.	Mete ŋu doa sɔ kplii.
I was very concerned about it for several reasons.	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ le susu geɖe ta.
No one is sure of it.	Ame aɖeke meka ɖe edzi o.
His voice was loud and clear.	Eƒe gbe sesẽ eye eme kɔ.
And that’s right.	Eye nya ma sɔ.
People came to his aid.	Amewo va kpe ɖe eŋu.
If anyone can do it, they can.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu awɔe la, ate ŋui.
Very, very big.	Gã ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
Or maybe it could, but not tonight.	Alo ɖewohĩ ate ŋu adzɔ, gake menye le zã sia me o.
Another device must be running.	Ele be mɔ̃ bubu nanɔ dɔ wɔm.
There is nothing better than that.	Naneke meli si nyo wu ema o.
This happened this year.	Esia dzɔ le ƒe sia me.
But you can’t take that.	Gake màte ŋu axɔ ema o.
I didn't come.	Meva o.
This building is very old.	Xɔ sia do xoxo ŋutɔ.
I didn’t expect it to be like that.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be anɔ nenema o.
A lot of things went wrong.	Nu geɖe va gblẽ.
But the one who bothered.	Gake ame si ɖe fu na la.
And to some extent, that is true.	Eye vaseɖe afi aɖe la, nya ma nye nyateƒe.
Thank you anyway.	Akpe na wò le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I am the opposite.	Nyee nye nusi to vovo na ema.
Just like back in his room.	Abe alesi wònɔ le eƒe xɔ me tsã ene.
He did a very good job.	Ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
None of them cared.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
We will work on it.	Míawɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
In fact, he wouldn’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, mawɔe nenema o.
Anything is possible, but not in a good way.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ, gake menye le mɔ nyui aɖe nu o.
Maybe you can make a man out of it.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu awɔ ŋutsu aɖe tso eme.
No food is needed.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke mehiã o.
It hasn’t worked and we’re not going backwards.	Mewɔ dɔ o eye míele megbe yim hã o.
It was a great opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖee wònye.
It’s just not my reality.	Ðeko menye nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
No one knows.	Ame aɖeke menya o.
Play a character.	Ƒo nɔnɔme aɖe.
But things did not improve there.	Gake nuwo meva nyo ɖe edzi le afima o.
That’s the most.	Emae nye esi sɔ gbɔ wu.
We live in a very exciting time.	Míele ɣeyiɣi si me dzidzɔ le ŋutɔ me.
Exactly how we are.	Ale si tututu míele.
It doesn’t surprise.	Mewɔa nuku na ame o.
I understand the whole situation.	Mese nɔnɔme bliboa gɔme.
Obviously, we can’t continue as we are.	Edze ƒã be míate ŋu ayi edzi abe alesi míele ene o.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Now, look at it.	Azɔ, kpɔ ɖa.
He just didn’t care.	Ðeko metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
That’s why he was here.	Esia tae wònɔ afisia ɖo.
I’m just a guy with a job.	Ŋutsu aɖe si si dɔ aɖe le koe menye.
I obviously did that.	Edze ƒã be mewɔe nenema.
Go out a little.	Do go vie.
But keep in mind here.	Gake nɔ susu me na wò le afisia.
It’s just not too late.	Ðeko metsi megbe akpa o.
No one can help you.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò o.
The room is very small.	Xɔa le sue ŋutɔ.
Now he had dignity.	Fifia bubu nɔ eŋu.
We can walk away.	Míate ŋu azɔ.
I did the same thing.	Nye hã mewɔe nenema.
It didn’t seem like he was really asking us.	Edze abe ɖe wònɔ mía biam ŋutɔŋutɔ ene o.
He enjoyed that part.	Akpa ma do dzidzɔ nɛ ŋutɔ.
This is a small place.	Teƒe sue aɖee nye esia.
Look at these two bones.	Kpɔ ƒu eve siawo ɖa.
And if they are.	Eye nenye be wole nenema la.
It still seems impossible.	Edze abe manya wɔ haɖe o ene.
We have no children.	Vi aɖeke mele mía si o.
Water is essential to life.	Tsi le vevie na agbe.
We can talk about it right here.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu tso eŋu le afisia tututu.
I don’t want to do anything about it.	Nyemedi be mawɔ naneke tso eŋu o.
That’s more difficult.	Ema sesẽ wu.
He was a hard worker.	Enye amesi doa vevie nu.
Please go ahead.	Taflatse yi ŋgɔ.
It goes on and on.	Yi edzi eye wòle edzi yim.
I don’t really understand any names.	Nyemese ŋkɔ aɖeke gɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Just a little dust	Ke sue aɖe ko
But please.	Gake taflatse.
Still, it was impressive.	Ke hã, ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
A lot of people don’t know about that.	Ame geɖe menya nu tso ema ŋu o.
And there’s a really simple reason.	Eye susu bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe li.
But this isn’t the case either.	Gake esia hã mele nenema o.
That makes it important.	Ema na wòle vevie.
These things are necessary.	Nu siawo hiã.
Each has one foot up.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ƒe afɔ ɖeka le dzi.
This machine cannot do anything new.	Mɔ̃ sia mate ŋu awɔ nu yeye aɖeke o.
Now, things are different.	Fifia, nuwo to vovo.
Again, there are two reasons.	Le afisia hã la, susu eve aɖewo li.
I can’t go anywhere without it.	Nyemate ŋu ayi afi aɖeke ema manɔmee o.
Talk to your people.	Ƒo nu kple wò amewo.
I’m glad he’s there.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ele afima.
It would be near there.	Anye be wòate ɖe afima ŋu.
I'll do one or two.	Mawɔ ɖeka alo eve.
Something is wrong.	Nane gblẽ.
I can be there for them.	Mate ŋu anɔ afima na wo.
It never worked well.	Mewɔ dɔ nyuie gbeɖe o.
The process will take hours.	Dɔa axɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe.
You had some really good stuff going on.	Nu nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖewo nɔ asiwò nɔ edzi yim.
All the people in the car died.	Ame siwo katã nɔ ʋua me la ku.
And nothing can do it.	Eye naneke mate ŋui o.
That’s a pretty big deal.	Ema nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
A great one.	Gã aɖe.
A car like this.	Ʋu abe esia ene.
None of them are working.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele dɔ wɔm o.
The room leans slightly to one side.	Xɔa ƒo ɖe akpa ɖeka vie.
Where you want to be.	Afisi nèdi be yeanɔ.
And we are well informed.	Eye míenya nu tso nu ŋu nyuie.
Can anyone tell me what this means?	Ðe ame aɖe ate ŋu agblɔ nusi esia fia nam?
Add the water and salt.	Tsɔ tsi kple dze la de eme.
There is a word in your ear.	Nya aɖe le wò to me.
We are a part of it.	Míenye eƒe akpa aɖe.
What it is is still excellent.	Nusi wònye la gakpɔtɔ nyo ŋutɔ.
Be careful what you wish for.	Kpɔ nyuie le nusi nèdi ŋu.
These words were very encouraging.	Nya siawo de dzi ƒo nɛ ŋutɔ.
Waiting for us to join him in the afternoon.	Le lalam be míawɔ ɖeka kplii le ŋdɔ me.
It’s just part of my life.	Nye agbe ƒe akpa aɖe koe wònye.
And maybe next month.	Eye ɖewohĩ le ɣleti si gbɔna me hã.
So close, closer than he has been in a year.	Te ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe, te ɖe eŋu wu alesi wònɔ le ƒe ɖeka me.
The king was just a man.	Ŋutsu aɖe koe fia la nye.
I was so smart.	Medze aɖaŋu ale gbegbe.
And more than once.	Eye wu zi ɖeka.
I can do no good here.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nyui aɖeke le afisia o.
Like he was a much younger man.	Abe ɖe wònye ŋutsu si metsi wu kura o ene.
It still doesn’t prove anything.	Meɖo kpe naneke dzi kokoko o.
That first week was tough.	Kwasiɖa gbãtɔ ma sesẽ ŋutɔ.
That takes time.	Ema bia ɣeyiɣi.
But that’s right.	Gake ema sɔ.
He didn’t take his eyes off the stern teacher.	Meɖe eƒe ŋku ɖa le nufiala sesẽ la ŋu o.
No one ever does this.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
That was quick.	Ema wɔ kaba.
Still, it seems to have worked.	Ke hã, edze abe ewɔ dɔ ene.
But life doesn’t have to be like that.	Gake mehiã be agbe nanɔ nenema o.
Thank you for being you.	Akpe na wò be nènye wò.
Please, help me out.	Taflatse, kpe ɖe ŋunye.
Blood will likely splatter on them.	Anɔ eme be ʋu aƒo ɖe wo dzi.
It seems to be the same.	Edze abe nenema ke ene.
That’s what it is.	Emae nye ema.
And he’s not the only one.	Eye menye eya ɖeka koe o.
That was all for him.	Ema koe nye ema nɛ.
But he found nothing.	Gake mekpɔ naneke o.
I told you how it is.	Megblɔ alesi wòle na wò.
I do this in order to survive.	Mewɔa esia be mate ŋu anɔ agbe.
I really like his work.	Eƒe dɔa dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
It’s so simple.	Eƒe nɔnɔme le bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
They had time.	Ɣeyiɣi nɔ wo si.
But this is something new.	Gake esia nye nu yeye aɖe.
You just treated him that way.	Ðeko nèwɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu nenema.
The present moment is the only moment in which we live.	Ɣeyiɣi si me míele fifia koe nye ɣeyiɣi si me míele.
He obviously had something on his mind.	Edze ƒã be nane nɔ susu me nɛ.
More work to be done.	Dɔ geɖe wu woawɔ.
Keep watching you.	Nɔ wò kpɔm.
The big challenge now begins.	Kuxi gã la dze egɔme fifia.
I can’t find one at that point.	Nyemate ŋu ake ɖe ɖeka ŋu le ɣeyiɣi ma me o.
That doesn’t seem to make sense.	Edze abe susu mele nya ma me o ene.
I made the mistake of having only one plan.	Mewɔ vodada be ɖoɖo ɖeka koe nɔ asinye.
We certainly don’t know this.	Míenya esia godoo o.
You can’t live with it.	Màte ŋu anɔ agbe ɖe enu o.
Get some rest, little man.	Gbɔ ɖe eme vie, ŋutsu sue.
Clearly, a few were having fun.	Edze ƒã be ame ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm.
There is something better for these people.	Nane li si nyo wu na ame siawo.
He didn’t want to do anything about it.	Medi be yeawɔ naneke le eŋu o.
He was just doing his job.	Ðeko wònɔ eƒe dɔ wɔm.
I’m really happy about that.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ɖe ema ŋu.
Or someone can.	Alo ame aɖe ate ŋu.
Maybe he didn’t.	Ðewohĩ mewɔe nenema o.
Much more than it used to be.	Nu geɖe wu alesi wònɔ tsã.
He couldn't say anything.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I can’t see his face.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ eƒe mo o.
This is just one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka koe nye esia.
I found a rock.	Meke ɖe kpe ŋu.
That made me feel better.	Ema na nye dzi dze eme.
A name is a name.	Ŋkɔ nye ŋkɔ.
I was a little disappointed.	Mete ɖe dzinye vie.
I found a way.	Mekpɔ mɔ aɖe.
Something is different.	Nane to vovo.
I don’t quite understand this.	Nyemese nya sia gɔme tututu o.
He is doing the right thing.	Ele nu nyui wɔm.
They are right in front of us.	Wole mía ŋgɔ tututu.
He seemed a little annoyed by that.	Edze abe ema do dziku nɛ vie ene.
There are two ways.	Mɔ eve li.
But the outcome could ultimately be positive.	Gake nusi ado tso eme ate ŋu anye nu nyui aɖe mlɔeba.
Not the other way around !!!.	Menye mɔ bubu nu o !!!.
He is not yet mature.	Metsi haɖe o.
I have another job for you.	Dɔ bubu aɖe le asinye na wò.
And he made his life.	Eye wòwɔ eƒe agbe.
You can’t be angry about that.	Màte ŋu ado dziku ɖe nya ma ŋu o.
Use this as breakfast.	Zã esia abe ŋdi nuɖuɖu ene.
I think it would be better if no one.	Mesusu be anyo wu ne ame aɖeke meli o.
It’s not a part of it.	Menye eƒe akpa aɖeke o.
I have that in my hands.	Ema le asinye.
Neither of us said anything.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.

That’s all there is to it.	Eya koe nye ema.
It's on my way.	Ele nye mɔ dzi.
What year is this?.	Ƒe kae nye esia?.
I don’t have any children.	Vi aɖeke mele asinye o.
It would have killed a lot of people.	Anye ne awu ame geɖe ŋutɔ.
And you are, too.	Eye wò hã nye.
A good one is worth the money.	Nyui aɖe sɔ na ga la.
That should be on board.	Ele be ema nanɔ ʋua me.
A year has passed.	Ƒe ɖeka va yi.
Last year proved that.	Ƒe si va yi ɖo kpe esia dzi.
None of them are known here.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menya le afisia o.
I know how to work there.	Menya alesi mawɔ dɔ le afima.
The price of flour was constantly rising.	Wɔ ƒe asi nɔ dzi yim ɣesiaɣi.
Finding a place is very difficult.	Teƒe didi sesẽ ŋutɔ.
But there is little else.	Gake nu bubu ʋɛ aɖewo koe li.
This cannot stand.	Esia mate ŋu anɔ te o.
Same thing, actually.	Nu ma ke, le nyateƒe me.
It seemed a little strange to me.	Edze nam be ewɔ nuku nam vie.
Something is wrong with them.	Nane gblẽ le wo ŋu.
He was only one child.	Vi ɖeka koe wònye.
He worked on it for weeks.	Ewɔ dɔ kwasiɖa geɖe le eŋu.
He is generally a great man.	Zi geɖe la, enye ame gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I know many others in the same situation.	Menya ame bubu geɖe siwo le nɔnɔme ma ke me.
There is no strategy behind it.	Aɖaŋu aɖeke mele megbe nɛ o.
I want to move forward.	Medi be mayi ŋgɔ.
Just amazing and wonderful.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku eye wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Write down what happened.	Ŋlɔ nusi dzɔ la ɖi.
It was a really good fit.	Enye nusi sɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Maybe some people did.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖewo wɔe nenema.
He can do this, he has to do this.	Ate ŋu awɔ esia, ele nɛ be wòawɔ esia.
That’s his idea, you know.	Emae nye eƒe susu, ènya.
Not much of a surprise.	Mewɔ nuku boo aɖeke o.
That’s why we’re here.	Esia tae míele afisia ɖo.
There is still very little water.	Tsi sue aɖe koe gakpɔtɔ li.
There were hours on it.	Gaƒoƒo geɖe nɔ edzi.
It worked for about two hours.	Ewɔ dɔ abe gaƒoƒo eve ene.
The enthusiasm is contagious.	Dzo si le eme la xɔa ame me.
This is so sick.	Esia dze dɔ ale gbegbe.
He was sick for a very long time.	Edze dɔ ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ.
But there is too much he can do now.	Gake nu geɖe akpa li wòate ŋu awɔ fifia.
You don’t have to do anything!	Mehiã be nàwɔ naneke o!
It's death.	Enye ku.
It’s not that simple.	Menye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
I had a lot to say.	Nya geɖe nɔ asinye magblɔ.
And that makes sense.	Eye susu le nya ma me.
The plaintiffs did not.	Ame siwo tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu la mewɔe nenema o.
Something between us somehow.	Nane le mía dome le mɔ aɖe nu.
In fact, he had two.	Le nyateƒe me la, eve nɔ esi.
I hope this rule will be followed.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be woawɔ ɖe se sia dzi.
I can give you some names.	Mate ŋu ana ŋkɔ aɖewo wò.
You're in for a very, very long night.	Èle zã didi aɖe ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ aɖe me.
It is quite a complicated project.	Enye dɔ si me kɔ kura.
But this isn’t the only thing they have in common.	Gake menye esia koe nye nu ɖeka si sɔ kple wo nɔewo o.
But this is not the case now.	Gake esia mele alea fifia o.
No one knows exactly what will happen.	Ame aɖeke menya nu si tututu ava dzɔ o.
Maybe he can.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋui.
It’s been a good two weeks.	Kwasiɖa eve nyui aɖe va yi.
Not a long time ago.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia o.
He gave them everything we had.	Etsɔ nusianu si le mía si la na wo.
And one foot.	Eye afɔ ɖeka.
Every room and every thing.	Xɔ ɖesiaɖe kple nu ɖesiaɖe.
Be another morning tomorrow morning.	Nye ŋdi bubu etsɔ ŋdi.
Life is a real thing.	Agbe nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I would rather marry .	Anyo nam wu be maɖe .
Not really like that.	Menye nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This should not be countenanced.	Mele be woawɔ mo na esia o.
How would you anyway.	Aleke nàwɔ le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I know you are on my side too.	Menya be wò hã èle nye akpa dzi.
I have a copy of this book.	Agbalẽ sia ƒe ɖe le asinye.
Thousands were trapped.	Ame akpe geɖe tsi mɔ̃ me.
He wasn't sure, anyway.	Meka ɖe edzi o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
There was nothing more.	Naneke menɔ anyi wu ema o.
I think that one is too strong.	Mesusu be ame ma sesẽ akpa.
He had a very good reason for it.	Susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ esi ɖe eŋu.
Like he didn’t care.	Abe ɖe metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ o ene.
I was angry in my turn.	Medo dziku le nye ɣeyiɣi me.
You used to be the only one who understood.	Wò ɖeka koe se egɔme tsã.
That is impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Every word is the same as every other word.	Nya ɖesiaɖe sɔ kple nya bubu ɖesiaɖe.
This is a difficult road.	Esia nye mɔ sesẽ aɖe.
He started a new project this year.	Edze dɔ yeye aɖe gɔme le ƒe sia me.
It shouldn’t surprise us.	Mele be wòawɔ nuku na mí o.
I only saw you.	Wò koe mekpɔ.
The apartment is beautiful.	Xɔa me nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
It's almost like he's in a state.	Ðeko wòle abe ɖe wòle nɔnɔme aɖe me ene kloe.
Please leave some comments.	Taflatse gblẽ nya aɖewo ɖi.
Few people do this.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔa esia.
I don’t really want to deal with this.	Nyemedi ŋutɔŋutɔ be makpɔ esia gbɔ o.
It wasn’t an idea he had.	Menye susu aɖe si nɔ esi o.
That took much longer.	Ema xɔ ɣeyiɣi didi wu kura.
That stuff isn’t my problem anyway.	Nu ma menye nye kuxi o le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
We hope you do the same.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be wò hã nàwɔ nenema ke.
I really don’t know what to do.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
Its dead there.	Eƒe ku ɖe afima.
I'll explain it to you.	Maɖe eme na wò.
He worked hard all day.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe ŋkeke bliboa.
I’m not really here.	Nyemele afisia ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I can give you a good deal on that.	Mate ŋu ana nu nyui aɖe wò le ema ŋu.
Not on any given day.	Menye le ŋkeke aɖeke dzi o.
We had nothing to do with that.	Naneke menɔ mía kple ema dome o.
At this point, he needed money more than anything else.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, ehiã ga wu nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
Be a lot of things.	Nye nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
It was a day earlier.	Enye ŋkeke ɖeka do ŋgɔ.
I have no desire to see this, ever.	Didi aɖeke mele asinye be makpɔ esia o, gbeɖe o.
You can find it from that.	Àte ŋu ake ɖe eŋu tso ema me.
Need space soon.	Hiã teƒe kpuie.
I'll save you.	Maɖe wò.
She bore him two children.	Edzi vi eve nɛ.
That’s why he was asking for time.	Esia tae wònɔ ɣeyiɣi biam ɖo.
That’s something.	Ema nye nane.
I'll do it soon.	Mawɔe kpuie.
That's right.	Ema nyo ya.
He did exactly what he was supposed to do.	Ewɔ nu si tututu wòle be wòawɔ.
There is nothing like it.	Naneke meli si sɔ kplii o.
He is going to do great for us for a very long time.	Ele nu gã aɖe wɔ ge na mí ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
But never anything like this.	Gake naneke si le abe esia ene gbeɖe o.
Up and down.	Dzi kple edzi.
There was always more.	Nu geɖe nɔ anyi ɣesiaɣi.
He can do it with pleasure.	Ate ŋu awɔe kple dzidzɔ.
But we can’t be in this situation.	Gake míate ŋu anɔ nɔnɔme sia me o.
A thread of a voice.	Gbe aɖe ƒe ka aɖe.
A new book is on the way.	Agbalẽ yeye aɖe le ŋgɔ gbɔna.
That made it easier.	Ema na wònɔ bɔbɔe wu.
There was someone in the room.	Ame aɖe nɔ xɔa me.
The night was clear.	Zã la me kɔ nyuie.
Only those very close to them saw them.	Ame siwo te ɖe wo ŋu ŋutɔ koe kpɔ wo.
What else could it be.	Nu bubu kae wòate ŋu anye.
Now, of course.	Fifia ya.
Here things are completely lost.	Le afisia la, nuwo bu kura.
He can’t help it.	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu o.
I need someone like that.	Mehiã ame aɖe si le abe ema ene.
It seems like a year ago.	Edze abe ƒe aɖee nye esia ene.
I struggled in my work.	Mewɔ avu le nye dɔ me.
Let us just emphasize the following.	Mina míate gbe ɖe nya siwo gbɔna dzi ko.
We can only hope that someone heard.	Ðeko míate ŋu akpɔ mɔ be ame aɖe se.
He just had never met anyone like him.	Ðeko medo go ame aɖeke abe eya ene kpɔ o.
And a gun, too.	Eye tu aɖe hã.
Some of them were small.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nɔ sue.
And that he needed my help.	Eye be ehiã nye kpekpeɖeŋu.
But it didn’t quite work.	Gake mewɔ dɔ tututu o.
It makes sense.	Susu le eme.
He went to the market alone.	Eya ɖeka koe yi asi me.
It just can’t happen.	Ðeko mate ŋu adzɔ o.
There was only one reason for that.	Susu ɖeka koe nɔ ema ta.
We know this too.	Esia hã míenya.
Come back soon.	Trɔ gbɔ kpuie.
The time in which we live now.	Ɣeyiɣi si me míele fifia.
Everything came back fine.	Nusianu trɔ gbɔ nyuie.
At least so far.	Vaseɖe fifia ya teti.
That kind of thing is just plain wrong.	Nu ma ƒomevi nye nu gbegblẽ si dze ƒã ko.
It was a good night.	Zã nyui aɖee wònye.
I was so nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ale gbegbe.
Clearly, something is wrong.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ.
But not as dramatic as this.	Gake menye nusi wɔ nuku abe esia ene o.
I was close enough to hear.	Mete ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe be mese.
In reality, however, the opposite happened.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ.
The same man killed his men.	Ŋutsu ma ke ye wu eƒe amewo.
But something seems to be wrong.	Gake edze abe nane gblẽ ene.
Now it’s successful.	Fifia edze edzi.
I just asked myself a simple question.	Nya bɔbɔe aɖe koe mebia ɖokuinye.
I had to talk to him alone.	Ele be nye ɖeka maƒo nu kplii.
Stay as wet as ever.	Nɔ tsi abe tsã ene.
And of course, he had help.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, kpekpeɖeŋu nɔ esi.
The money was there.	Ga la nɔ afima.
In fact, many people.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame geɖe.
This is impossible, and illogical.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o, eye susu hã manɔ eme o.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I had to do something.	Ele be mawɔ nane.
Show what it could be.	Fia nusi ate ŋu anye.
It could have easily been the opposite.	Ate ŋu anye nusi to vovo na ema bɔbɔe hafi.
He couldn’t tell her what to do.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nusi wòawɔ nɛ o.
And yet.	Eye ke hã.
In fact, he seemed to really like her.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze abe eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
There had never been anything close to that.	Naneke aɖeke menɔ anyi si te ɖe ema ŋu kpɔ o.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
Leave a space.	Gblẽ teƒe aɖe ɖi.
I think there are two things going on there.	Mesusu be nu eve aɖewo le edzi yim le afima.
And yet, very much the same.	Eye ke hã, nenema ke ŋutɔ.
But something must have happened.	Gake nane anya dzɔ.
It would have been better to do everything in buy.	Anye ne anyo wu be woawɔ nusianu le ƒle me.
I know everyone is busy.	Menya be vovo mele amesiame ŋu o.
If you don’t have it, you can’t understand it.	Ne mele asiwò o la, màte ŋu ase egɔme o.
But go easy.	Gake yi bɔbɔe.
That part is very important.	Akpa ma le vevie ŋutɔ.
It was an old building.	Enye xɔ xoxo aɖe.
We need to do something about that.	Ele be míawɔ nane tso ema ŋu.
Maybe it’s just something that exists.	Ðewohĩ nane si li ko wònye.
Does anyone have any comments?	Ðe nya aɖewo le ame aɖe si?
Not just one that takes care of everything.	Menye ɖeka si kpɔa nusianu gbɔ koe o.
But of course it didn’t.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
I have it all working.	Wo katã wole dɔ wɔm le asinye.
How many children do you have?	Vi nenie le asiwò?
Two or more chapters are better than one.	Ta eve alo esi wu nenema nyo wu ɖeka.
This city is beautiful.	Du sia nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
That’s all there is to it.	Ema koe nye nya la.
A long, long time ago.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I am sure he will.	Meka ɖe edzi be awɔe nenema.
No one does, really.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa esia o, le nyateƒe me.
I know this city well.	Menya du sia nyuie.
And you can never know the truth.	Eye màte ŋu anya nyateƒea gbeɖe o.
We really can’t do anything else.	Le nyateƒe me la, míate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke wu ema o.
Just a little is enough.	Vi aɖe koe sɔ gbɔ.
A few months later.	Ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo megbe.
Get out of the house more often.	Do go le aƒea me zi geɖe wu.
Everything points to it.	Nusianu fia asi edzi.
To tell you the truth, I was shocked.	Ne magblɔ nyateƒea na mi la, ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
To do that.	Be woawɔ ema.
It will work well.	Awɔ dɔ nyuie.
We are not doing this legally.	Menye ɖe míele esia wɔm le se nu o.
Things are kicking off here.	Nuwo le egɔme dzem le afisia.
It can’t go the same way.	Mate ŋu ayi mɔ ma ke dzi o.
Do the opposite.	Wɔ nusi to vovo na ema.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
Not just yet, anyway.	Menye haɖe ko o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
At the same time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me.
He was a pushover.	Enye ame si ƒoa amewo ɖe amewo ŋu.
In fact, that is what he deserves.	Le nyateƒe me la, emae nye nusi dze nɛ.
You said you could.	Ègblɔ be yeate ŋui.
Good things that are clear.	Nu nyui siwo me kɔ nyuie.
It may be that way.	Ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
It seems like a long time ago.	Edze abe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia ene.
Yet he did not ask for more than he could give.	Ke hã mebia nu geɖe wu esi wòate ŋu ana o.
I can do something for you.	Mate ŋu awɔ nane na wò.
Live a normal life.	Nɔ agbe si sɔ.
The car approached us.	Ʋua te ɖe mía ŋu.
I tried to imagine what that might be like.	Medze agbagba be makpɔ alesi ema ate ŋu anɔ le susu me.
I know this is true.	Menya be nya sia nye nyateƒe.
In fact, he really doesn’t know too much.	Le nyateƒe me la, le nyateƒe me la, menya nu geɖe akpa o.
I wanted something long, but not too long.	Medi nane si didi, gake menye didi akpa o.
But there is a time and a place for everything.	Gake ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe li na nusianu.
What, I don’t know.	Nukae, menya o.
Similarly two weeks later.	Nenema ke le kwasiɖa eve megbe.
Night or night.	Zã alo zã.
Nice to finally meet you.	Enye dzidzɔ nam be medo go wò mlɔeba.
Every last bit of it.	Eƒe akpa mamlɛtɔ ɖesiaɖe.
I was the same way.	Nye hã menɔ nenema ke.
The actual reality is harder.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si dzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ la sesẽ wu.
The money is hot.	Ga la xɔ dzo.
There can be no one else.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
He fell down a lot.	Edze anyi ŋutɔ.
This is very exciting.	Esia doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
Yet he couldn’t be quite sure.	Ke hã mete ŋu ka ɖe edzi tututu o.
I'm just not sure what exists.	Ðeko nyemeka ɖe nusi li dzi o.
Yet we are not doing anything.	Ke hã míele naneke wɔm o.
In fact, they are.	Le nyateƒe me la, wole nenema.
It’s not too late, you know.	Metsi megbe akpa o, ènya.
In a city somewhere.	Le du aɖe me le afi aɖe.
It is important to us.	Ele vevie na mí.
He was very attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
The same thing can happen.	Ate ŋu adzɔ nenema ke.
I knew something would come up.	Menya be nane ado mo ɖa.
I saw too much not too.	Mekpɔ nu geɖe akpa menye nenema hã o.
But I can find nothing about it.	Gake nyemate ŋu akpɔ naneke tso eŋu o.
His eyes were on me.	Eƒe ŋku nɔ ŋunye.
I had only one clear idea.	Susu ɖeka si me kɔ koe nɔ asinye.
Here and here.	Afisia kple afisia.
Maybe it’s because of my age.	Ðewohĩ ƒe si mexɔ tae.
He didn’t answer.	Meɖo eŋu o.
To my surprise, there was nothing.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ be naneke meli o.
It's working really well for just about everything.	Ele dɔ wɔm nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ na nusianu kloe.
No one has ever asked me that.	Ame aɖeke mebia nya ma nam kpɔ o.
No one ever looked at us.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ ŋku ɖe mía ŋu kpɔ o.
This is also difficult for you, try this.	Esia hã sesẽ na wò, te esia kpɔ.
There wasn’t much new.	Nu yeye boo aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Plan them in advance.	Wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe wo ŋu do ŋgɔ.
The night was getting worse.	Zã nɔ edzi yim.
That just made my whole night.	Ðeko ema wɔ nye zã bliboa.
I was worried for that reason.	Metsi dzi ɖe susu ma ta.
Never in our lives.	Le míaƒe agbe me gbeɖe o.
Now they only have four.	Fifia ene koe le wo si.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Maybe it’s not you.	Ðewohĩ menye wòe o.
It seemed to make a new person for me.	Edze abe ewɔ ame yeye nam ene.
And the reasons why.	Eye susu siwo tae wòle nenema ɖo.
But his attitude has changed dramatically.	Gake eƒe nɔnɔme trɔ ŋutɔ.
He is here now.	Ele afisia fifia.
I did try though.	Medze agbagba nyateƒe gake.
Now that this actually happened, he didn’t say anything.	Fifia si esia dzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ la, megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I liked him well enough.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam nyuie.
There is simply no way.	Ðeko mɔ aɖeke meli o.
There was only one thing about it.	Nu ɖeka koe nɔ eŋu.
I knew someone had died.	Menya be ame aɖe ku.
It will help me a lot.	Akpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ.
And also in my own name.	Eye le nye ŋutɔ nye ŋkɔ me hã.
For now, it is.	Fifia ya, ele nenema.
It was more surprising to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam wu.
You told me that.	Wòe gblɔ nya ma nam.
Closer to it.	Te ɖe eŋu wu.
That’s just the nature of things.	Nuwo ƒe nɔnɔme koe nye ema.
It made absolutely no sense.	Susu aɖeke kura menɔ eme o.
Contact us if you have any questions.	Te ɖe mía ŋu ne nya aɖe le asiwò.
However, more people mean more cars.	Ke hã, ame geɖe wu fia ʋu geɖe wu.
He had never been so alone in his life.	Menye eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi alea le eƒe agbe me kpɔ o.
It felt like an original idea.	Ewɔ nam abe susu gbãtɔ aɖee wònye ene.
Still, there are some positives.	Ke hã nu nyui aɖewo li.
I was very impressed with him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ.
He can’t go on.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi o.
It’s why that part is interesting.	Enye nusita akpa ma doa dzidzɔ na ame ɖo.
We have enough of it.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ le mía si.
What he was on.	Nusi dzi wònɔ.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Nyemenya nusi ava dzɔ o.
You and I, here, can do that.	Mía kple wò, le afisia, míate ŋu awɔ ema.
Death like everything else.	Ku abe nusianu ene.
A lot of this doesn’t make sense at all.	Susu mele nya geɖe ŋu le esia ŋu kura o.
There is nothing we can do.	Naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ o.
I don’t have any teeth.	Aɖu aɖeke mele asinye o.
I was angry.	Medo dziku.
Take a closer look.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie.
There is very little in between.	Nu sue aɖe koe le wo dome.
This is a fact.	Esia nye nyateƒe.
Where he wasn’t sure.	Afisi meka ɖe edzi le o.
It doesn’t really matter.	Mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
If this is true, keep busy.	Ne nya sia nye nyateƒe la, ke vovo nanɔ ŋuwò.
He looked tired, but not sick.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ene, gake medze dɔ o.
Like every hour or so.	Abe gaƒoƒo ɖesiaɖe alo esi wu nenema ene.
This seems to be appropriate.	Edze abe esia sɔ ene.
Again, he heard nothing.	Le afisia hã la, mese naneke o.
Or maybe it didn’t.	Alo ɖewohĩ mewɔe nenema o.
Try food less often.	Te nuɖuɖu kpɔ zi geɖe o.
Now start over again.	Azɔ dze egɔme ake.
I'll just call him now.	Ðeko maƒo ka nɛ fifia.
We know everything.	Míenya nusianu.
I'm giving you time.	Mele ɣeyiɣi nam wò.
That way no one will see you.	To mɔ sia dzi la, ame aɖeke makpɔ wò o.
the voice is amazing.	gbe si le eme la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There was a lot going on.	Nu geɖe nɔ edzi yim.
There was no time for anything.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi na naneke o.
It started in my own life.	Edze egɔme le nye ŋutɔ nye agbe me.
Please let me know if you have any questions.	Taflatse na manya ne nya aɖe le asiwò.
Who is this man ?	Amekae nye ŋutsu sia ?
A life is precious.	Agbe aɖe xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Yet something big is going on.	Ke hã nu gã aɖe le edzi yim.
This was very appealing to him.	Esia dze eŋu ŋutɔ.
His character is bad.	Eƒe nɔnɔme gblẽ.
That’s a good thing.	Nya nyui aɖee nye ema.
Thank you.	Akpe na wò.
His work began.	Eƒe dɔa dze egɔme.
Start putting things in perspective now.	Dze nuwo ɖoɖo ɖe nɔnɔme nyui me gɔme fifia.
I like the dog.	Avu la dzɔa dzi nam.
Be careful!	Kpɔ nyuie!
But maybe that’s just me.	Gake ɖewohĩ nye koe nye ema.
That kind of work is not easy.	Dɔ ma ƒomevi mele bɔbɔe o.
It just might take a little longer.	Ðeko wòate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi vie wu.
This is not realistic.	Esia menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
It’s been a long road for me.	Mɔ didi aɖee wònye nam.
He doesn’t look like her.	Medze abe eya ene o.
The matter is now in the hands of the police.	Nya la le kpovitɔwo si me azɔ.
At a time when few did.	Le ɣeyiɣi si me ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔe nenema.
He had his own plan.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe ɖoɖo aɖe nɔ esi.
I never heard you cry.	Nyemese wò avi kpɔ o.
Nor would he tell her it wasn’t coming his way.	Eye magblɔ nɛ hã be mele eƒe mɔ dzi gbɔna o.
No voice answered him.	Gbe aɖeke meɖo eŋu nɛ o.
Lose a car.	Bu ʋu aɖe.
Year, month, day.	Ƒe, ɣleti, ŋkeke.
And that’s his point.	Eye emae nye eƒe nya.
Let go, fall.	Ðe asi le eŋu, dze anyi.
Again, he made himself.	Le esia hã me la, ewɔ eɖokui.
Not like it used to be.	Menye abe tsã ene o.
You can’t justify that.	Màte ŋu aɖo kpe esia dzi o.
Maybe next summer.	Ðewohĩ le dzomeŋɔli si gbɔna me.
But now he was more focused.	Gake fifia eƒe susu va nɔ eŋu wu.
I should like to say something.	Ele be madi be magblɔ nya aɖe.
No one else ever said that about me.	Ame bubu aɖeke megblɔ nya ma tso ŋunye kpɔ o.
But he was a very good teacher.	Gake enye nufiala nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
He can't seem to stand it.	Edze abe mete ŋu nɔa te ɖe enu o ene.
It’s a whole new life.	Enye agbe yeye kura.
But my mind is clear now.	Gake nye susu me kɔ azɔ.
Maybe he doesn’t know himself.	Ðewohĩ menya eɖokui o.
He escaped from the police.	Esi le kpovitɔwo nu.
We only have two.	Eve koe le mía si.
But now, things are different.	Gake fifia, nuwo to vovo.
It is a good name.	Enye ŋkɔ nyui aɖe.
He didn’t do well for himself.	Mewɔ nu nyuie na eɖokui o.
I'm starting to ease up and see what happens.	Mele egɔme dzem bɔbɔe be makpɔ nusi adzɔ.
Why is he doing this?	Nukatae wòle esia wɔm?
I really wanted to do this.	Medi vevie be mawɔ esia.
You can’t just do it.	Màte ŋu awɔe ko o.
He put his hand over his heart.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ɖo eƒe dzi dzi.
He has been ill for a long time.	Edze dɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
People don’t seem to care.	Edze abe amewo metsɔ ɖeke le eme o ene.
They didn’t have it.	Menɔ wo si o.
None of it made any sense.	Susu aɖeke menɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o.
I am old enough to remember when it used to be a good thing.	Metsi ale gbegbe be meɖo ŋku ɣeyiɣi si me wònye nu nyui aɖe tsã la dzi.
Another passed behind him.	Bubu hã to eƒe megbe.
Tell me one thing.	Gblɔ ɖeka nam.
There is, or was, a man.	Ŋutsu aɖe le afima, alo nɔ anyi.
Be careful!	Kpɔ nyuie!
He’s always focused.	Eƒe susu nɔa nu ŋu ɣesiaɣi.
. . . .	.
He has all your people.	Wò amewo katã le esi.
Everything is set up.	Nusianu ɖoɖo.
We cannot continue on the path we are on.	Míate ŋu ayi mɔ si dzi míele la dzi o.
The house was damaged.	Aƒea gblẽ nu le eŋu.
He wasn’t sure it would work.	Meka ɖe edzi be awɔ dɔ o.
He doesn’t know these ways.	Menya mɔ siawo o.
And it was an idea in my head.	Eye enye susu aɖe si nɔ nye ta me.
Be a man, a child.	Nye ŋutsu, ɖevi.
State your reasons.	Gblɔ susu siwo tae nèle.
After that, everything went smoothly.	Le ema megbe la, nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
It’s good news for a bad situation.	Enye nya nyui aɖe na nɔnɔme gbegblẽ aɖe.
This is a fascinating thing.	Esia nye nu si doa dzidzɔ na ame.
This is a very surprising thing.	Esia nye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Everyone is there for a reason.	Susu aɖe tae amesiame le afima ɖo.
Stand or sit while you work.	Tsi tre alo nɔ anyi esime nèle dɔ wɔm.
There is absolutely no water.	Tsi aɖeke kura meli o.
We have a lot of hard work to do.	Dɔ sesẽ geɖe le mía si míawɔ.
I didn’t expect to do it.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be mawɔe o.
Anything can be true.	Nusianu ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
He had two children.	Vi eve nɔ esi.
There is a difficulty, of course.	Sesẽ aɖe li ya.
He liked her for that.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ le ema ta.
From this the .	Tso esia me la .
I think that day will come soon.	Mesusu be ŋkeke ma ava kpuie.
It’s too easy.	Ele bɔbɔe akpa.
Its been a while since I have been on it.	Eƒe ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye sia tso esime menɔ edzi.
As he spoke, he attacked me.	Esi wònɔ nu ƒom la, edze dzinye.
But we’re not going to give up.	Gake míele ta ɖe ge o.
Nothing matters now.	Naneke mele vevie fifia o.
It still seems more reasonable to me.	Edze nam kokoko be susu le eme wu.
More than a few of them were not so simple.	Wo dometɔ siwo wu ʋɛ aɖewo koe menɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
They’re calling him tomorrow.	Wole ka ƒom nɛ etsɔ.
The car sped away.	Ʋua ƒu du dzo.
He seems to be asking questions.	Edze abe ele nya biam ene.
It will always work.	Awɔ dɔ ɣesiaɣi.
He didn’t know how long before that.	Menya ɣeyiɣi didi si do ŋgɔ na ema o.
He had never touched her.	Meka asi eŋu kpɔ o.
It didn’t come easily this time.	Meva bɔbɔe zi sia o.
I know my character.	Menya nye nɔnɔme.
She would have loved this house.	Anye ne aƒe sia adzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
Find a balance.	Di nusi da sɔ.
You have to tell us something.	Ele be nàgblɔ nya aɖe na mí.
They went up.	Va yi dzi.
As simple as that.	Le bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
His life was very difficult.	Eƒe agbe sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Please help me out.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye.
In a year or two, it could happen.	Le ƒe ɖeka alo eve megbe la, ate ŋu adzɔ.
It doesn’t matter who you are.	Ame si nènye la mehiã o.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Gake menye nu gbegblẽ o.
He was nowhere at all.	Menɔ afi aɖeke kura o.
He liked her character.	Eƒe nɔnɔme dze edzi nɛ.
The police are involved.	Kpovitɔwo le eme.
This just happened to me.	Esia dzɔ ɖe dzinye fifia ko.
In your case, attitude.	Le wò nya me la, nɔnɔme.
He will marry you tomorrow.	Aɖe wò etsɔ.
I didn’t have time for that.	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye na ema o.
This is a real thing.	Esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s a big deal.	Enye nya gã aɖe.
You can sit right here.	Àte ŋu anɔ anyi ɖe afisia tututu.
I will tell you something else.	Magblɔ nya bubu aɖe na wò.
In fact, it’s amazing.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
And now its about them.	Eye fifia wò ku ɖe wo ŋu.
This is a bad idea.	Esia nye susu gbegblẽ aɖe.
That issue is being addressed.	Wole nya ma gbɔ kpɔm.
But this too will pass.	Gake esia hã ava yi.
For the first year or so there was a lot of excitement.	Le ƒe gbãtɔ alo esi wu nenema me la, dzidzɔ geɖe nɔ anyi.
It was too much for me.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ nam akpa.
And do it right.	Eye wɔe nyuie.
I don’t really know what to say.	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
You.	Wò.
There was no sense in it.	Susu aɖeke menɔ eme o.
But one thing.	Gake nu ɖeka.
But he was just like that.	Gake eya hã nɔ nenema ko.
I glanced at him.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe eŋu.
It was like he was there.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe wònɔ afima ene.
But he is on to something.	Gake ele nane dzi.
I had to find my own job.	Ele be madi nye ŋutɔ nye dɔ.
So many words.	Nya geɖe ale gbegbe.
The protective mechanism worked in two ways.	Mɔ̃ si kpɔa ame ta la wɔ dɔ le mɔ eve nu.
But we can handle this.	Gake míate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ.
It doesn’t matter what happens from here.	Nusi dzɔ tso afisia dzi la mehiã o.
I'm interested in why you're treating us so badly.	Metsɔ ɖe le nusita nèle nu gbegblẽ wɔm ɖe mía ŋu alea gbegbe la me.
My mouth is in order.	Nye nu le ɖoɖo nu.
I don’t understand it, and I never have.	Nyemese egɔme o, eye nyemese egɔme kpɔ o.
Maybe look there.	Ðewohĩ kpɔ afima ɖa.
Change or your life is over.	Trɔ alo wò agbe wu enu.
I'm not doing this right.	Nyemele esia wɔm nyuie o.
He will be happy to see you.	Adzɔ dzi nɛ be yeakpɔ wò.
I have to find myself.	Ele be madi ɖokuinye.
Tell me who did this.	Gblɔ amesi wɔ esia nam.
I couldn’t get up.	Nyemete ŋu fɔ o.
It is a law.	Enye se aɖe.
I think he might be looking for something missing.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ nane si bu la dim wòle.
We had to work through some very difficult issues.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ to nya sesẽ ŋutɔ aɖewo me.
Maybe that’s why the police didn’t believe me.	Ðewohĩ esia tae kpovitɔwo mexɔ dzinye se o ɖo.
And the hottest one.	Eye esi xɔ dzo wu.
Summer isn’t quite here.	Dzomeŋɔli meɖo afisia tututu o.
A great lake.	Ta gã aɖe.
Or maybe he can’t.	Alo ɖewohĩ mate ŋui o.
It was a wonderful day.	Enye ŋkeke nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
So far everything was working fine.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nusianu nɔ dɔ wɔm nyuie.
This makes a lot of sense.	Susu le nya sia me ŋutɔ.
I have to go to work.	Ele be mayi dɔme.
My face was hot.	Nye mo xɔ dzo.
I suffered the same thing myself.	Nye ŋutɔ hã kpe fu le nu ma ke ta.
But the night was too clear.	Gake zã la me kɔ akpa.
I’m so glad I did.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mewɔe.
It’s a part of me.	Enye nye akpa aɖe.
I asked them in the following way.	Mebia wo le mɔ si gbɔna nu.
This is very important.	Esia le vevie ŋutɔ.
But he had made mistakes before.	Gake ewɔ vodada tsã.
How impossible it is.	Alesi mate ŋu adzɔ o.
It could be.	Ate ŋu anye.
There are a lot of deserted roads.	Mɔ siwo dzi ame aɖeke mele o la sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
Its as simple as that.	Eƒe bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
I didn’t make the hole.	Menye nyee wɔ doa o.
Why, it doesn’t matter.	Nukatae, mele vevie o.
It was a small town, but it was lively.	Du sue aɖee wònye, gake agbe nɔ eme.
He made a mistake.	Ewɔ vodada.
It could have been a great job for him.	Ate ŋu anye dɔ gã aɖe nɛ hafi.
I’m.	Menye.
Every face we know.	Mo ɖesiaɖe si míenya.
Now, on the first day, no one came.	Azɔ, le ŋkeke gbãtɔ dzi la, ame aɖeke meva o.
As long as you want or.	Zi alesi nèdi alo.
Two men were sitting inside.	Ŋutsu eve nɔ anyi ɖe eme.
Too much time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe akpa va yi.
I wish I had more time.	Medi be makpɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu.
Here, where it’s at, you know.	Le afisia la, afi si wòle la, ènya.
There should be more of them.	Ele be wo dometɔ geɖe nanɔ afima.
This type of work is not cheap.	Dɔ sia ƒomevi mexɔ asi o.
Look, everybody, there.	Kpɔ ɖa, amesiame, le afima.
Excited!	Kpɔ dzidzɔ!
Maybe it’s better that he doesn’t.	Ðewohĩ anyo wu be mewɔe nenema o.
I wonder why.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae hã.
But this time things are a little different.	Gake fifia ya nuwo to vovo vie.
But it is necessary.	Gake ehiã.
This house is old.	Aƒe sia do xoxo.
Sooner than he expected, too.	Kaba wu alesi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ, eya hã.
But it can be complicated.	Gake ate ŋu anye nusi me kɔ.
He has a hot tongue.	Aɖe si me dzo le le esi.
Someone’s dog.	Ame aɖe ƒe avu.
I thought that was just me.	Mesusu be nye koe nye ema.
I could never be like that.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
It’s bothering me.	Ele fu ɖem nam.
It really is a bad situation.	Nɔnɔme gbegblẽ aɖee wònye ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Yet, many have done so.	Ke hã ame geɖe wɔe nenema.
Me too, actually.	Nye hã, le nyateƒe me.
The matter is over.	Nya la wu enu.
He needs your common sense.	Ehiã wò susu nyui.
They had no other choice.	Mɔ bubu aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
He probably won’t either.	Ðewohĩ mawɔe nenema hã o.
But it was a big lie.	Gake alakpa gã aɖee wònye.
In fact, it did fall.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze anyi nyateƒe.
I am very happy to be here.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mele afisia.
But I would say, he can’t say.	Gake magblɔ be, mate ŋu agblɔ o.
I explained everything to him.	Meɖe nusianu me nɛ.
What it was like after that.	Alesi wònɔ le ema megbe.
He didn’t say that exactly, though.	Megblɔ nya ma tututu o, gake.
None of these initiatives have much popular support.	Amewo ƒe kpekpeɖeŋu boo aɖeke mele ɖoɖo siawo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o.
I can’t tell you much.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nu geɖe na wò o.
That may well overcome it.	Ema ate ŋu aɖu edzi nyuie.
Search after search after search.	Didi le didi megbe le didi megbe.
But he’s also smart, in his way.	Gake edze aɖaŋu hã, le eƒe mɔ nu.
This stone is different.	Kpe sia to vovo.
Go where we are not.	Yi afisi míele o.
It may not work for you.	Ðewohĩ mawɔ dɔ na wò o.
I asked how he managed.	Mebia alesi wòwɔ te ŋui.
I am trying to find a house.	Mele agbagba dzem be madi aƒe aɖe.
Or start it.	Alo dze egɔme.
Buy some food.	Ƒle nuɖuɖu aɖewo.
Now, it’s here.	Azɔ, ele afisia.
You have to act now.	Ele be nàwɔ nu fifia.
I think it worked well.	Mesusu be ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
Please, get inside.	Taflatse, ge ɖe eme.
He wasn’t happy there.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ le afima o.
For the words that came out of my mouth.	Na nya siwo do tso nye nu me.
It may be that way.	Ate ŋu anye nenema.
Fuck them over and over again.	Fu wo zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
There is a paradox here.	Nusi tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu le afisia.
And so that worried me.	Eye ale be ema tsi dzinye.
That was impressive .	Ema wɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ .
What is that.	Nukae nye ema.
Like anything is possible.	Abe alesi nusianu anya wɔ ene.
A lot has happened today.	Nu geɖe dzɔ egbea.
A job, a job.	Dɔ aɖe, dɔ aɖe.
He complied with my request.	Ewɔ ɖe nye nya dzi.
He couldn’t do anything about it.	Mete ŋu wɔ naneke tso eŋu o.
That’s just a good idea.	Susu nyui koe nye ema.
I think there will be.	Mesusu be anɔ anyi.
But today is different.	Gake egbea ya to vovo.
You’re the one I am.	Wòe nye nye.
We’re here to stay.	Míele afisia.
Maybe, just maybe, this could work.	Ðewohĩ, ɖewohĩ ko, esia ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
The passing years have given him all the dignity.	Ƒe siwo va yi la na bubu katã le eŋu.
I'm going backwards.	Mele megbe yim.
Everyone laughed a lot.	Amesiame ko nu geɖe.
But really, like this.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, abe esia ene.
You have to tell me the truth.	Ele be nàgblɔ nyateƒea nam.
That worked out well.	Ema wɔ dɔ nyuie.
It’s a good thing.	Nu nyui aɖee wònye.
It’s a job for life, too.	Enye dɔ na agbe, hã.
This is your thing.	Nye wò nu sia.
For many reasons.	Le susu geɖe ta.
I’m there, too.	Nye hã mele afima.
So was he, too.	Eya hã nɔ nenema.
His dog barked loudly.	Eƒe avu la ƒo nu sesĩe.
And he was focused on her.	Eye eƒe susu katã nɔ eŋu.
He wasn’t happy about that.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe nya ma ŋu o.
We could have talked in it.	Míate ŋu aɖo dze le eme hafi.
I should never have done it, of course.	Mele be mawɔe gbeɖe o ya.
But he's not really seeing anything.	Gake mele naneke kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Like, I'm really sorry.	Abe, meɖe kuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I’m glad you have money.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ga le asiwò.
I know this is possible.	Menya be esia anya wɔ.
He is a practitioner.	Enye amesi wɔa dɔ.
It is so much easier.	Ele bɔbɔe wu ale gbegbe.
It’s not difficult, but it’s essential.	Menye nu sesẽ o, gake ehiã ŋutɔ.
There is so much to do.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li woawɔ.
Food came very quickly.	Nuɖuɖu va kaba ŋutɔ.
This is something many of us can relate to.	Esia nye nusi mía dometɔ geɖe ate ŋu ase egɔme.
I could understand it.	Mete ŋu se egɔme.
Maybe it’s something new.	Ðewohĩ enye nu yeye aɖe.
He was a very orderly man.	Enye ŋutsu si wɔa nu ɖe ​​ɖoɖo nu ŋutɔ.
Add in your monthly bills.	Tsɔ fe siwo le asiwò ɣleti sia ɣleti la kpe ɖe eŋu.
I never heard much about it.	Nyemese nya geɖe tso eŋu kpɔ o.
But he probably won’t.	Gake ɖewohĩ mawɔe nenema o.
I see you have that one.	Mekpɔ be ɖeka ma le asiwò.
Obviously two very different things.	Edze ƒã be nu eve siwo to vovo kura.
It was too much for him.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ nɛ akpa.
The mind works the same way.	Susu hã wɔa dɔ nenema ke.
I was nervous though.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ya.
And he was working for her too.	Eye eya hã nɔ dɔ wɔm na eya hã.
I worked for you for a long time.	Mewɔ dɔ na wò ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
Where you have everything, but, nothing.	Afisi nusianu le asiwò, gake, naneke mele asiwò o.
There is a time and place for this.	Ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe aɖe li na esia.
I didn’t mean to though.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔe o gake.
I don’t know, inspire me.	Nyemenya o, de dzo lãme nam.
It’s never a waste of time.	Menye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ gbeɖe o.
But there is something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã li.
A few people, too.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo hã.
In this life you have one shot at it.	Le agbe sia me la, tu ɖeka le asiwò ɖe eŋu.
So did everyone else.	Nenema ke ame sia ame hã wɔe.
But what about the guns that person already has.	Gake tu siwo le ame ma si xoxo ya ɖe.
These kinds of things should always be like that.	Ele be nu siawo ƒomevi nanɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi.
In this city.	Le du sia me.
Guys like him still have some rules.	Se aɖewo gakpɔtɔ le ŋutsu siwo le abe eya ene si.
Be really useful.	Ðe vi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The morning is already here.	Ŋdi ɖo xoxo.
I got that role.	Mexɔ akpa ma.
I have nothing left.	Naneke megale asinye o.
The big man thought for a moment.	Ame gã la bu eŋu vie.
Everything about it was different.	Nusianu si ku ɖe eŋu la to vovo.
But you don’t know that.	Gake mènya ema o.
Not even you.	Menye wò hã o.
If it increases, it will be a problem.	Ne edzi ɖe edzi la, anye kuxi.
A good opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ nyui aɖe.
He seemed so alone.	Edze abe eya ɖeka ko ene ale gbegbe.
In the same way.	Le mɔ ma ke nu.
I have two reasons.	Susu eve le asinye.
I can do that better than he can .	Mate ŋu awɔ ema nyuie wu alesi wòate ŋui .
Every dog ​​has its day.	Avu ɖesiaɖe kple eƒe ŋkeke.
You can remove your hair.	Àte ŋu aɖe wò ɖa ɖa.
I am enjoying myself.	Mele dzidzɔ kpɔm.
There are only a few exceptions.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe to vovo.

Everyone was talking to us.	Amesiame nɔ nu ƒom na mí.
We don’t have a job right now.	Dɔ aɖeke mele mía si fifia o.
Since last year.	Tso ƒe si va yi me.
We are moving forward.	Míele ŋgɔ yim.
He can, of course.	Ate ŋui ya.
It probably would have saved quite a few.	Anɔ eme be axɔ na ame ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ hafi.
This process can be time consuming.	Dɔ sia te ŋu xɔa ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
Hard as nails.	Sesẽ abe ɖa ene.
I’ve heard about it.	Mese nu tso eŋu.
Everything you can have.	Nusianu si ate ŋu anɔ asiwò.
It doesn’t look right.	Medze nyuie o.

It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
I just can’t escape now.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu asi le ɖokuinye me fifia o.
We really liked it.	Edze mía ŋu ŋutɔ.
That’s part of it.	Ema nye eƒe akpa aɖe.
It’s not the right thing to do.	Menye nusi sɔ o.
A clear thing.	Nu si me kɔ.
I want to meet you.	Medi be mado go.
I was interested in that person.	Metsɔ ɖe le ame ma me.
Please, go ahead.	Taflatse, yi ŋgɔ.
That is very important to us.	Ema le vevie na mí ŋutɔ.
We can help you out.	Míate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
Why you don’t know that is amazing.	Nusita mènya ema o la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I just remembered that.	Ðeko meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi.
Something happened to him.	Nane dzɔ ɖe edzi.
In fact, the reality is quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si le eme la to vovo kura na ema.
I joined him last week.	Mewɔ ɖeka kplii le kwasiɖa si va yi me.
He seems to be fine.	Edze abe ele nyuie ene.
We don’t know much about each other.	Míenya nu boo aɖeke tso mía nɔewo ŋu o.
It will be so.	Anye nenema.
This is against the law.	Esia tsi tre ɖe se la ŋu.
I had to talk to him.	Ele nam be maƒo nu kplii.
And that’s another thing.	Eye emae nye nu bubu.
Any bad timing can be fatal.	Ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ ɖesiaɖe ate ŋu awu ame.
Happy new year!.	Ƒe yeye na wò!.
Four men entered the house.	Ŋutsu ene ge ɖe aƒea me.
But one thing seems clear.	Gake edze abe nu ɖeka me kɔ nyuie ene.
It’s wonderful, you know.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, ènya.
I guess in itself it’s not a bad thing.	Mesusu be le eɖokui si menye nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
Two days passed, somehow.	Ŋkeke eve va yi, le mɔ aɖe nu.
I am sure I did that.	Meka ɖe edzi be mewɔe nenema.
A very different situation.	Nɔnɔme si to vovo kura.
On that day.	Le ŋkeke ma dzi.
When you put them on.	Esi wò do wo.
It’s something you have.	Enye nane si le asiwò.
And it doesn’t matter.	Eye mehiã o.
This water serves many purposes.	Tsi sia wɔa dɔ geɖe.
It’s what they want, and they have it.	Enye nusi dim wole, eye wòle wo si.
It looks good.	Edze nyuie.
It was a wonderful job!	Dɔ nyui aɖee wònye!
That's what.	Emae nye...
It will help me figure something out.	Akpe ɖe ŋunye makpɔ nane ŋu.
I was worried, too.	Nye hã metsi dzi.
But it will come.	Gake ava.
This metallic wire is rusty.	Ka sia si ŋu ga le la xɔ dzo.
But something was still bothering him.	Gake nane gakpɔtɔ nɔ fu ɖem nɛ.
I discovered that myself, before this.	Nye ŋutɔ meke ɖe ema ŋu, do ŋgɔ na esia.
He was only here for a month.	Ɣleti ɖeka koe wònɔ afisia.
I resisted it.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu.
He had two houses, two cars.	Aƒe eve, ʋu eve nɔ esi.
There is no hand in it.	Asi aɖeke mele eŋu o.
Nothing surprised him.	Naneke mewɔ nuku nɛ o.
His people didn’t.	Eƒe amewo mewɔe nenema o.
He started working.	Edze dɔ gɔme.
Same,	Ema ke,
He couldn’t hold down food for a few days.	Mete ŋu lé nuɖuɖu ɖe anyi ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo o.
I’m not going anywhere.	Nyemele afi aɖeke yim o.
There was no one here.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afisia o.
This bothered him a lot.	Esia ɖe fu nɛ ŋutɔ.
However, be careful.	Ke hã, kpɔ nyuie.
He won’t be happy, but he will be happy.	Makpɔ dzidzɔ o, gake anye dzidzɔ.
Also in that year.	Azɔ hã le ƒe ma me.
I really, really met you.	Medo go wò ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I thought it was amazing.	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Which could be just as good.	Nusi ate ŋu anyo nenema ke.
No one had ever touched him.	Ame aɖeke ka asi eŋu kpɔ o.
But again, it doesn’t matter.	Gake le afisia hã la, mehiã o.
But the reality is quite different.	Gake nyateƒea ya to vovo kura.
In short, he was a man like anyone else.	Kpuie ko la, enye ŋutsu abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
Not for you and you.	Menye na wò kple wò o.
I planned the whole thing.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe nu bliboa ŋu.
And that’s a big deal now.	Eye nya gã aɖee nye ema fifia.
There is nothing between you and me.	Naneke mele mía kpli wò dome o.
Another drop of water.	Tsi bubu aɖe hã ge dze anyi.
I don’t know how to do it.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔe o.
I have never wanted to talk to him more in my life.	Nyemedi be maƒo nu kplii wu esia le nye agbe me kpɔ o.
I'll call everyone tomorrow.	Maƒo ka na amesiame etsɔ.
It’s true, in a way.	Enye nyateƒe, le mɔ aɖe nu.
Now everything is working fine for him.	Fifia nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie nɛ.
He never stood up.	Metsi tre kpɔ o.
I just never realized that until now.	Ðeko nyemekpɔ ema dze sii kpɔ o vaseɖe fifia.
There is definitely some kind of truth behind it.	Nyateƒe aɖe ƒomevi le megbe nɛ godoo.
It also seems smaller.	Edze abe eƒe akpa aɖe hã le sue wu ene.
But many others may not.	Gake ɖewohĩ ame bubu geɖe mawɔe nenema o.
He could let me go because of him.	Ate ŋu aɖe asi le ŋunye le eya ta.
I'd better talk the whole thing out.	Anyo be maƒo nu bliboa katã.
I know about this.	Menya nu tso esia ŋu.
His voice came from very close by.	Eƒe gbe tso teƒe si te ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ.
But now the work has stalled.	Gake fifia la, dɔa tɔ te.
I can’t take care of myself.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye dzi o.
It can be annoying in this way.	Ate ŋu ado dziku na ame le mɔ sia nu.
I treat myself very well.	Mewɔa nu ɖe ​​ɖokuinye ŋu nyuie ŋutɔ.
Still, almost every hand in the room went up.	Ke hã, asi ɖesiaɖe kloe si nɔ xɔa me la yi dzi.
If only you could do it.	Ne àte ŋu awɔe ko.
Come on, take a chance.	Va, tsɔ mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe.
Four thousand added to it.	Akpe ene kpe ɖe eŋu.
And it lasted about an hour.	Eye wònɔ anyi abe gaƒoƒo ɖeka ene.
But that didn’t work.	Gake ema medze edzi o.
It is a simple task.	Enye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖe.
But it has happened.	Gake edzɔ kpɔ.
Now you can do that.	Fifia àte ŋu awɔ ema.
I have my own mind.	Nye ŋutɔ nye susu le asinye.
No one seems to be coming this way.	Edze abe ame aɖeke mele mɔ sia dzi gbɔna o ene.
I got really sick over it.	Medze dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ le esia ta.
Keep your head down.	Na wò ta nanɔ anyi.
He’s just happy to be there.	Ðeko wòle dzidzɔ kpɔm be yeanɔ afima.
He has handled this himself.	Eya ŋutɔ kpɔ esia gbɔ kpɔ.
He will do anything.	Awɔ nusianu.
Stand up against them.	Tsi tre ɖe wo ŋu.
Write a letter to someone.	Ŋlɔ agbalẽ na ame aɖe.
I wish I knew the truth!	Anye ne manya nyateƒea!
Almost all of them are very good.	Wo katã kloe nyo ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t believe what was happening.	Mete ŋu xɔ nusi nɔ edzi yim la dzi se o.
We all have to work together to do this.	Ele be mí katã míawɔ dɔ ɖekae awɔ esia.
But there might not be much time.	Gake ɖewohĩ ɣeyiɣi geɖe manɔ anyi o.
Come now, get up.	Va azɔ, tso.
It wouldn’t be, it couldn’t be, it couldn’t be.	Manɔ nenema o, mate ŋu anɔ nenema o, mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
In many cases, this is fine.	Le go geɖe me la, esia nyo.
A house needs people in it.	Aƒe hiã amewo le eme.
I was a little worried too.	Nye hã metsi dzi vie.
Work hard in school.	Wɔ dɔ sesĩe le suku.
In up close and personal.	Le te ɖe eŋu kple ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
But he didn’t care.	Gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
Or who he is.	Alo amesi wònye.
I have a place we can go.	Teƒe aɖe le asinye si míate ŋu ayi.
I want this dress.	Medi awu sia.
I needed this.	Mehiã esia.
It’s either my way or no way.	Enye nye mɔ alo mɔ aɖeke meli o.
And some may have heard more .	Eye ɖewohĩ ame aɖewo se nu geɖe wu .
Good quality for that price.	Nɔnɔme nyui aɖe na asi ma.
It will never be like that.	Manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
And I saw you and your life.	Eye mekpɔ wò kple wò agbe.
Without it, he cannot win.	Ema manɔmee la, mate ŋu aɖu dzi o.
This is a great device.	Esia nye mɔ̃ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But it’s not that much.	Gake menye nenema gbegbe o.
But he made a face.	Gake ewɔ mo.
There was only a hole.	Do aɖe koe nɔ afima.
Tell us what you liked or didn’t like.	Gblɔ nu siwo do dzidzɔ na wò alo nu siwo medze ŋuwò o la na mí.
I think it would be great.	Mesusu be anyo ŋutɔ.
I want to go home.	Medi be mayi aƒeme.
I just don’t want that life.	Ðeko nyemedi be agbe ma nanɔ asinye o.
But there was more than that.	Gake nu geɖe wu ema nɔ anyi.
It was very pleasant to him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
Everything was working fine.	Nusianu nɔ dɔ wɔm nyuie.
A big help to us really.	Kpekpeɖeŋu gã aɖe na mí ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I did it once.	Mewɔe zi ɖeka.
It was a great opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖee wònye.
However, you may also have many issues.	Ke hã, nya geɖe ate ŋu anɔ asiwò hã.
Nothing was going to change that.	Naneke menɔ ema trɔ ge o.
Two people usually come to talk.	Zi geɖe la, ame eve va ƒoa nu.
Everyone would have just gone on with their lives.	Ðeko amesiame ayi eƒe agbe dzi hafi.
But it’s already too weird.	Gake ewɔ nuku akpa xoxo.
I think you can do him good.	Mesusu be àte ŋu awɔ nyui nɛ.
They don’t have the right people.	Ame siwo sɔ la mele wo si o.
It will be so.	Anye nenema.
This is obviously nothing like that.	Edze ƒã be esia menye naneke nenema o.
I just don’t understand it.	Ðeko nyemese egɔme o.
I will get there late.	Mava ɖo afima tsi megbe.
Have a stable home.	Aƒe si me li ke le nanɔ asiwò.
They are expecting death.	Wole mɔ kpɔm na ku.
Really bad thinking on his part.	Susu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ le eƒe akpa dzi.
More than one person had died there.	Ame siwo wu ɖeka ku le afima kpɔ.
His past life didn’t give a damn.	Agbe si nɔ esi va yi la metsɔ ɖeke na o.
But it is there.	Gake ele afima.
Where he is now.	Afisi wòle fifia.
That part is easy.	Akpa ma le bɔbɔe.
I know a lot of people.	Menya ame geɖe.
I don’t have to talk to you.	Mehiã be maƒo nu kpli wò o.
That’s enough for me, too.	Ema hã sɔ gbɔ nam.
We have a difficult situation here.	Nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe le mía ŋu le afisia.
It’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Everyone is different.	Ame ɖesiaɖe to vovo.
Which we are doing well.	Nusi wɔm míele nyuie.
Another hour until the fight.	Gaƒoƒo bubu vaseɖe esime woawɔ avu.
Something can happen twice.	Nane ate ŋu adzɔ zi eve.
In the first position, sit with one leg raised.	Le nɔnɔme gbãtɔ me la, nɔ anyi kple afɔ ɖeka kɔ ɖe dzi.
She didn’t want him to come this close to me.	Medi be mate ɖe ŋunye alea o.
I was a little surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nam vie.
I don’t want this.	Nyemedi esia o.
Not to death.	Menye ɖe ku me o.
He couldn’t find it.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
Law.	Se.
I hope that was useful in some way.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ema ɖe vi le mɔ aɖe nu.
I know we can do it.	Menya be míate ŋui.
They are going to kill you.	Wole wò wu ge.
Define the issues that apply to people.	Ðe nya siwo ku ɖe amewo ŋu la gɔme.
This is one of them.	Esia nye ɖeka.
Which is hard, man.	Nusi sesẽ, ame.
More work can be good for you.	Dɔ geɖe wɔwɔ ate ŋu anyo na wò.
This is not easy for him.	Esia mele bɔbɔe nɛ o.
But it showed no small amount.	Gake meɖe nu sue aɖeke fia o.
And yet she would need this man’s help.	Eye ke hã ahiã ŋutsu sia ƒe kpekpeɖeŋu.
Surprisingly, his voice was.	Ewɔ nuku be eƒe gbe nɔ.
I refused, of course.	Megbe ya.
And that’s the case here.	Eye esia le alea le afisia.
It was a very good meal.	Enye nuɖuɖu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
This takes care of that.	Esia kpɔa ema gbɔ.
I have a new job now.	Dɔ yeye aɖe le ŋunye fifia.
That was good for him, just for once.	Ema nyo nɛ, zi ɖeka ko.
I don’t know who it is.	Nyemenya ame kae o.
But this isn’t surprising.	Gake esia mewɔ nuku o.
Come on, think about it.	Va, bu eŋu kpɔ.
There was only one thing to do.	Nu ɖeka koe nɔ anyi be woawɔ.
But nothing good can come of it for either of them.	Gake nyui aɖeke mate ŋu ado tso eme na wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
I have my own.	Nye tɔ le asinye.
This was very helpful.	Esia kpe ɖe ame ŋu ŋutɔ.
Not in the afternoon.	Menye le ŋdɔ megbe o.
And two, nothing is going on.	Eye eve, naneke mele edzi yim o.
Maybe that other sweat will be posthumous.	Ðewohĩ fifia bubu ma anye ku megbe.
I am by no means alone in this.	Menye nye ɖeka koe le esia me kura o.
And that this can happen again and again.	Eye be esia ate ŋu adzɔ zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I got money like that.	Mexɔ ga nenema.
It was my fault that I screwed up.	Enye nye vodada be mewɔ nu gbegblẽ.
He can do it.	Ate ŋu awɔe.
But if it is so.	Gake ne ele nenema la.
He couldn't or wouldn't say anything about that.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nya aɖeke tso ema ŋu alo magblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Or something more than that.	Alo nusi wu ema.
I want you to tell me what you think.	Medi be nàgblɔ nusi nèsusu nam.

He hasn’t been in a while.	Meva o ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
It was a very good meal.	Enye nuɖuɖu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Tom was focused on his work.	Tom ƒe susu nɔ eƒe dɔa ŋu.
Maybe there were more of them.	Ðewohĩ wo dometɔ geɖe wu nɔ anyi.
On the previous afternoon.	Le ŋdɔ si do ŋgɔ me.
This guy was always talking about himself.	Ŋutsu sia nɔa nu ƒom tso eɖokui ŋu ɣesiaɣi.
He is on his way here now.	Ele mɔ dzi le afisia fifia.
It wasn’t worth fighting back.	Meɖe vi be woawɔ avu ɖe eŋu o.
I was very interested in it.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme ŋutɔ.
They went up.	Va yi dzi.
That’s not a good thing.	Ema menye nu nyui aɖeke o.
I think it will be here soon.	Mesusu be ava afisia kpuie.
That is a complete lie.	Ema nye alakpa kura.
Not a very stable system.	Menye ɖoɖo si li ke tututu o.
Or a system.	Alo ɖoɖo aɖe.
I wanted a man with a gun.	Medi ŋutsu aɖe si si tu le.
Money just went so far.	Ðeko ga yi ŋgɔ alea gbegbe.
I felt it would help me.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be akpe ɖe ŋunye.
I tried this, but kept having the same issue.	Mete esia kpɔ, gake nya ma ke yi edzi nɔ fu ɖem nam.
But he couldn't think of that.	Gake mete ŋu bu nya ma ŋu o.
He couldn’t do anything else.	Mete ŋu wɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
Many things can happen.	Nu geɖe ate ŋu adzɔ.
We can’t do anything there.	Míate ŋu awɔ naneke le afima o.
I will stay here.	Manɔ anyi ɖe afisia.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
Please come, as soon as you can .	Taflatse va, kaba ne àte ŋui .
You know he will.	Ènya be awɔe nenema.
This is a job, like any other job.	Esia nye dɔ, abe dɔ bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
In a way, it is.	Le mɔ ɖeka nu la, ele nenema.
Maybe you can help me.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
Not when I was working.	Menye esime menɔ dɔ wɔm o.
Stay behind my back.	Tsi megbe nye megbe.
There are a few things you are looking for.	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo li siwo dim nèle.
You said something this morning.	Ègblɔ nya aɖe ŋdi sia.
This is appropriate.	Esia sɔ.
I do this work here.	Mewɔa dɔ sia le afisia.
You made that statement.	Wòe wɔ nya ma.

I wonder if this is okay.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe esia nyo hã.
I can’t stand it.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu o.
But it would be great.	Gake anyo ŋutɔ.
Think about them over the next few days.	Bu wo ŋu le ŋkeke ʋɛ siwo gbɔna me.
I don’t want anything to do with it.	Nyemedi be naneke nawɔ ɖeka kplii o.
Talk to them.	Ƒo nu kpli wo.
This will benefit someone.	Esia aɖe vi na ame aɖe.
I ask for too much.	Mebiaa nu geɖe akpa.
I have had many.	Mexɔ geɖe kpɔ.
I hope that is not true.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nya ma menye nyateƒe o.
He has something for everyone.	Nane le esi na amesiame.
I shouldn’t say anything.	Mele be magblɔ nya aɖeke o.
Or the car?.	Alo ʋua?.
But that passed, quickly.	Gake ema va yi, kaba.
I rejected that.	Megbe nya ma.
It was so clear to me.	Eme kɔ nam ale gbegbe.
Not that year, not any year.	Menye ƒe ma me o, menye ƒe aɖeke o.
There really isn’t much going on here.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu geɖe mele edzi yim le afisia o.
Everyone was working on something different.	Amesiame nɔ dɔ wɔm tso nane si to vovo ŋu.
He could only hope she was waiting for him now.	Ðeko wòate ŋu anɔ mɔ kpɔm be ele ye lalam fifia.
The dog did a lot of damage.	Avu la gblẽ nu geɖe ŋutɔ.

No one opposed the project.	Ame aɖeke metsi tre ɖe dɔa ŋu o.
Salt is essential for life.	Dze le vevie ŋutɔ na agbe.
There was no problem with it.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
Which still exists today.	Nusi gakpɔtɔ li egbea.
Thank you so much for this piece.	Akpe geɖe na mi ɖe akpa sia ta.
I couldn’t get the word out of my mouth.	Nyemete ŋu na nya la do le nye nu me o.
He would set us up there if he could.	Aɖo mí le afima ne wòate ŋui.
On the car.	Le ʋua ŋu.
This is not surprising at all.	Esia mewɔ nuku kura o.
A house that has seen some seriously better days.	Aƒe si kpɔ ŋkeke aɖewo siwo nyo wu vevie kpɔ.
If you can do that, it’s pretty easy, actually.	Ne àte ŋu awɔ ema la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I'm not sure what it is.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi wònye dzi o.
He was very clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ.
Yet, there is nothing he can do.	Ke hã naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ o.
He had no mental focus.	Susu ƒe susu menɔ eŋu o.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Actually, that’s enough.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema sɔ gbɔ.
He could not escape his own life.	Mete ŋu si le eya ŋutɔ ƒe agbe me o.
Keep it up!.	Yi edzi nenema!.
On the day of the meeting.	Le ŋkeke si dzi woawɔ kpekpea.
I just started now.	Ðeko medze egɔme fifia.
That sounds pretty good.	Ema ɖi nya nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o, le nyateƒe me.
He cannot be surprised.	Mate ŋu awɔ nuku nɛ o.
You don’t want one anyway.	Mèdi ɖeka le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
This should be on the right side.	Ele be esia nanɔ akpa si dze le la dzi.
Whose name is very simple, but important.	Ame si ƒe ŋkɔ le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ, gake ele vevie.
Support.	De megbe.
I wondered if he could understand us.	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe wòate ŋu ase mía gɔme hã.
We can also be in a bad mood.	Míate ŋu anɔ nɔnɔme gbegblẽ me hã.
Consider another scenario.	Bu nɔnɔme bubu aɖe ŋu kpɔ.
What is that?.	Nukae nye ema?.
Now he might have a bigger role to play.	Fifia ɖewohĩ akpa gã aɖe anɔ esi wòawɔ.
At least for a while.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe ya teti me.
He couldn’t talk for hours.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu gaƒoƒo geɖe o.

But it’s been a long time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.

Not much more than that.	Menye nu geɖe wu ema wu ema o.

They would have been awesome.	Anye ne woawɔ nuku ŋutɔ hafi.
I don’t want to be here.	Nyemedi be manɔ afisia o.

Nothing to do about that now.	Naneke meli woawɔ tso ema ŋu fifia o.
You have to cooperate with him.	Ele be nàwɔ ɖeka kplii.

I allowed myself to open up to him.	Meɖe mɔ na ɖokuinye ʋu eme nɛ.
Keep everything in writing.	Na nusianu nanɔ agbalẽ me.
You have so much to say.	Nya geɖe ŋutɔ le asiwò nàgblɔ.
And that’s as far as I’ve gotten before.	Eye ema nye afisi meɖo do ŋgɔ.
That’s what we need to work on.	Emae nye nusi ŋu wòle be míawɔ dɔ le.
He was just more with himself.	Ðeko wònɔ eɖokui ŋu wu.

It cannot exist.	Mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
I’m so glad I liked it so much.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Honestly, I don’t want to see them either.	Le nyateƒe me la, nye hã nyemedi be makpɔ wo o.
I'm really, really sorry.	Meɖe kuku ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Clearly, they are doing something illegal.	Edze ƒã be nu si mele se nu o wɔm wole.

For a while that was all.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me la, ema koe nye ema.
Tell everyone what we are doing.	Gblɔ nu si wɔm míele la na amesiame.
Maybe other places he doesn’t know.	Ðewohĩ teƒe bubu siwo menya o.

There was no reason.	Susu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
One of them is timing.	Wo dometɔ ɖekae nye ɣeyiɣi ɖoɖo.

There is truth there.	Nyateƒe le afima.
Good afternoon everyone.	Ŋdɔ nyui na amesiame.

Maybe he can handle some of them.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu akpɔ wo dometɔ aɖewo gbɔ.
Everyone felt it.	Amesiame se le eɖokui me.
Not that that matters now.	Menye ɖe ema le vevie fifia o.

That’s what we are to them.	Emae nye nusi míenye na wo.
He worked hard for a long time.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
He slammed his leg in anger.	Etsɔ dziku ƒo eƒe afɔ.
It worked out great for everyone.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ na amesiame.
I just couldn’t do the job.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu wɔ dɔa o.
For hard work while doing so.	Le dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ esime wònɔ esia wɔm ta.
The wind blew his face.	Ya ƒo eƒe mo.

It’s a big problem right now.	Enye kuxi gã aɖe fifia.
But he enjoys his work.	Gake eƒe dɔa dzɔa dzi nɛ.

It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.

He couldn’t get himself out of the car.	Mete ŋu ɖe eɖokui le ʋua me o.
And if there is none.	Eye ne ɖeke meli o la.
Maybe he has some really good ideas.	Ðewohĩ susu nyui aɖewo ŋutɔŋutɔ le esi.

And he didn’t do that.	Eye mewɔe nenema o.
Wear warm clothes.	Do awu siwo me dzo le.

He couldn't say exactly what that was.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nusi tututu ema nye o.

Right now there is no work going on inside.	Fifia ko la, dɔ aɖeke mele edzi yim le eme o.

This was a bad thing to do on a summer morning.	Esia nye nu gbegblẽ si woawɔ le dzomeŋɔli ƒe ŋdi aɖe me.
The water is dirty.	Tsi ƒo ɖi.

And no one else knows about it.	Eye ame bubu aɖeke menya nu tso eŋu o.
It was a beautiful sunny day.	Enye ŋkeke nyui aɖe si dzi ŋdɔ ʋu nyuie.
You can handle this.	Àte ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ.

In fact, that problem already exists.	Le nyateƒe me la, kuxi ma li xoxo.

It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I really need you.	Mehiã wò ŋutɔŋutɔ.
They will do what they like.	Woawɔ nu si dze wo ŋu.
I don’t know anything about it.	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o.
Today is perfect for this project.	Egbea sɔ nyuie na dɔ sia.
Ultimately, it’s a matter of personal preference.	Mlɔeba la, enye ame ŋutɔ ƒe didi ƒe nya.
We are running through our work.	Míele du dzi to míaƒe dɔa me.
No one ever offered the impossible.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o la na kpɔ o.
Do what you have to do.	Wɔ nu si wòle be nàwɔ.
He will come looking for you.	Ava di wò.
And there is no one.	Eye ame aɖeke meli o.
A mistake in it is a mistake.	Vodada le eme nye vodada.
The task is simple enough for a child to do.	Dɔa le bɔbɔe ale gbegbe be ɖevi ate ŋu awɔe.
Let me know what you want to do.	Na manya nu si nèdi be yeawɔ.
Yet there is nothing he can do about it.	Ke hã naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu o.
I do want to be in it.	Nye ya medi be manɔ eme ya.
That fire must have surprised you.	Dzo ma anya wɔ nuku na wò ŋutɔ.
He needs our help.	Ehiã míaƒe kpekpeɖeŋu.
You're just really tired.	Ðeko ɖeɖi te ŋuwò ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I know what it was like.	Menya ale si wònɔ.
This is my point.	Esia nye nye nya.
I don’t know about anyone else.	Nyemenya nu tso ame bubu aɖeke ŋu o.
This book is for anyone and everyone.	Agbalẽ sia nye ame sia ame kple amesiame tɔ.
Many died well.	Ame geɖe ku nyuie.
Everything in it is true and false.	Nusianu si le eme la nye nyateƒe kple alakpa.
It worked really well for him.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ nɛ.
They are launching this week.	Wole egɔme dzem le kwasiɖa sia me.
That person is very famous.	Ame ma xɔ ŋkɔ ŋutɔ.
In better shape than you.	Le nɔnɔme nyui me wu wò.
I was with someone.	Menɔ ame aɖe gbɔ.
Two men carried guns.	Ame eve tsɔ tu ɖe asi.
He will work out what happened.	Awɔ dɔ tso nusi dzɔ ŋu.
We can do them all.	Míate ŋu awɔ wo katã.
Something is wrong here.	Nane gblẽ le afisia.
It just has to be.	Ðeko wòle be.
There was nothing in them about this.	Naneke menɔ wo me ku ɖe nya sia ŋu o.
These clothes are very expensive.	Awu siawo xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I just wanted to talk to him, to talk to him.	Ðeko medi be maƒo nu kplii, be maƒo nu kplii.
That’s your problem.	Emae nye wò kuxi.
One of them would have found it.	Anye ne wo dometɔ ɖeka ke ɖe eŋu hafi.
He fell seriously ill soon after.	Edze dɔ vevie le ema megbe kpuie.
Let’s do this.	Mina míawɔ esia.
Other than that, I have one more idea.	Ne menye nenema o la, susu ɖeka bubu le asinye.
I couldn’t stand it.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
It is a good name.	Enye ŋkɔ nyui aɖe.
She lives alone in a small house.	Eya ɖeka koe le aƒe sue aɖe me.
No one else seems to either.	Edze abe ame bubu aɖeke hã mewɔe nenema o ene.
It’s not valid yet, for that matter.	Megale eteƒe haɖe o, le nya ma ta.
People are talking about me.	Amewo le nu ƒom tso ŋunye.
I think you’re in a very bad way if that happens.	Mesusu be èle mɔ gbegblẽ aɖe nu ŋutɔ ne edzɔ alea.
Tell him the truth.	Gblɔ nyateƒea nɛ.
It seemed strange to me.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nam ene.
He hurried to the car.	Ewɔ kaba yi ʋua gbɔ.
I was there this morning.	Menɔ afima ŋdi sia.
I was in a place.	Menɔ teƒe aɖe.
Will take care of that tomorrow.	Akpɔ ema gbɔ etsɔ.
That could be me.	Ema ate ŋu anye nye.
I'm good with anywhere.	Me nyo kple afi sia afi.
I’m glad you’re satisfied.	Edzɔ dzi nam be wò dzi dze eme.
In the summer, you need to book weeks in advance.	Le dzomeŋɔli la, ele be nàwɔ agbalẽ kwasiɖa geɖe do ŋgɔ.
In short, nothing works.	Kpuie ko la, naneke mewɔa dɔ o.
That’s a good idea.	Susu nyuie nye ema.
None of them are there.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele afima o.
A hard life has affected him.	Agbe sesẽ aɖe gblẽ nu le eŋu.
None of us are like that.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mele nenema o.
He is one of us.	Mía dometɔ ɖekae wònye.
Bear with me a little.	Do dzi nam vie.
Things weren’t going well.	Nuwo nɔ edzi yim nyuie o.
Again, he didn’t answer.	Le afisia hã la, meɖo eŋu o.
Every little thing.	Nu sue ɖesiaɖe.
However, he did not say these things.	Ke hã, megblɔ nya siawo o.
I'm kind of.	Me le ƒomevi aɖe me.
Food prices remain low.	Nuɖuɖu ƒe asi gakpɔtɔ le bɔbɔe.
But things have changed, and everything is better.	Gake nuwo trɔ, eye nusianu nyo wu.
This is not one of the difficult issues involved.	Esia menye nya sesẽ siwo ku ɖe nya sia ŋu la dometɔ ɖeka o.

And after that.	Eye le ema megbe la.

Not not now.	Menye menye fifia o.
I just fell down.	Ðeko medze anyi.
I don’t know anything about it.	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o.
He wasn’t doing that great.	Menye nu gã ma wɔm wònɔ o.
not sure why it's giving me as much trouble as it is.	nyemeka ɖe nusita wòle kuxi nam abe alesi wòle ene dzi o.
He didn’t do anything.	Mewɔ naneke o.
Too hard, if anything.	Sesẽ akpa, ne nane li.
Anyone can be one.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu anye ɖeka.
Less is really more.	Nu sue aɖe koe nye nu geɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I have always been a problem child.	Nyee nye ɖevi si ŋu kuxi le ɣesiaɣi.
Obviously, his name is already there.	Edze ƒã be eƒe ŋkɔ le afima xoxo.
Now hold your tongue!	Azɔ lé wò aɖe ɖe asi!
I will be watching you.	Manɔ wò kpɔm.
It’s just a good news.	Nya nyui koe.
It’s an honor to meet you.	Enye bubu nam be mado go wò.
And this is only the first part.	Eye akpa gbãtɔ koe esia nye.
Until you and someone else’s mind became real.	Vaseɖe esime wò kple ame bubu ƒe susu va nɔ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ wɔm.
Thank you, man.	Akpe na wò, ame.
But it didn’t work.	Gake mewɔ dɔ o.

It would be easy if they were.	Anɔ bɔbɔe nenye be wole nenema.
As if it was more than that.	Abe ɖe wònye nusi wu ema ene.
Now everything is over.	Fifia nusianu wu enu.

Just some of the characters.	Ame siwo le eme la dometɔ aɖewo koe.

But it can be a bit expensive.	Gake ate ŋu axɔ asi vie.
We have a great job ahead of us.	Dɔ gã aɖe le mía ŋgɔ.

And that’s why it’s so personal.	Eye esia tae wònye ame ŋutɔ ƒe nya ɖo.

He wouldn’t do this to her.	Mawɔ esia ɖe eŋu o.
He was a very knowledgeable teacher.	Enye nufiala si nya nu ŋutɔ.
But here, the.	Gake le afisia la,...
Do you want to continue living this way?	Ðe nèdi be yeayi edzi anɔ agbe alea?

And he’s a good guy.	Eye wònye ame nyui.
I can’t stay.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
I am so glad I was able to help.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mete ŋu kpe ɖe eŋu.
He seemed very normal.	Edze abe eƒe nɔnɔme sɔ ŋutɔ ene.
He wasn’t ready.	Menɔ klalo o.

Death and death.	Ku kple ku.

I was the only one left.	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
There was a great deal of work to be done.	Dɔ gã aɖe nɔ anyi si wòle be woawɔ.
Some people are always angry.	Ame aɖewo doa dziku ɣesiaɣi.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Usually not myself when you are there.	Zi geɖe la, menye nye ŋutɔ nyee ne èle afima o.
Something for everyone.	Nane na amesiame.
I’m really neither here nor there.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemele afisia alo afima o.
Consider the incident.	Bu nu si dzɔ ŋu kpɔ.
It is a small place with a very nice interior.	Enye teƒe sue aɖe si ƒe eme le nyuie ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t find it anywhere.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu le afi aɖeke o.
Lots and lots of days like this.	Ŋkeke geɖe kple geɖe abe esia ene.
I started working.	Medze dɔ gɔme.
He didn’t see anything.	Mekpɔ naneke o.
It doesn’t matter what.	Mehiã be woawɔ nukae o.
Perhaps this shouldn’t surprise us.	Ðewohĩ mele be esia nawɔ nuku na mí o.

We have to fight it.	Ele be míawɔ avu kplii.

It’s someone.	Ame aɖee.
There was something missing here.	Nane nɔ anyi si bu le afisia.
Stay away from that place.	Te ɖa le teƒe ma ŋu.
In a very big way.	Le mɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ nu.
I think either of them can win this year.	Mesusu be wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ate ŋu aɖu dzi le ƒe sia me.
This would be a great thing.	Esia anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.

He looked tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ene.

You are in a very difficult position.	Èle nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe me ŋutɔ.
No one asked any questions.	Ame aɖeke mebia nya aɖeke o.

I'm sure it will be wonderful.	Meka ɖe edzi be anyo ŋutɔ.
He will need to work on that.	Ahiã be wòawɔ dɔ tso ema ŋu.
It was too much for us.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ akpa na mí.
The fit is excellent.	Nusi sɔ la nyo ŋutɔ.
But this year, opinion is different.	Gake le ƒe sia me la, amewo ƒe susu to vovo.
I had been in school.	Menɔ suku kpɔ.
He started sweating.	Edze fifia gɔme.
I can’t imagine what he would do about it.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi wòawɔ tso eŋu le susu me o.
What is it that happened.	Nukae nye nusi dzɔ.
When was that time? 	Ɣekaɣie nye ema?
This is not true at all.	Esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
The people of that city seemed happy.	Edze abe ame siwo nɔ du ma me la kpɔ dzidzɔ ene.
It was a mistake anyone could have made.	Enye vodada si ame aɖe ate ŋu awɔ hafi.
I can’t hear this stuff.	Nyemate ŋu ase nu sia o.
Share your work with someone else.	Gblɔ wò dɔa na ame bubu.
I think it’s right here.	Mesusu be ele afisia tututu.
You are my heart.	Wòe nye nye dzi.
That means it’s real.	Ema fia be enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And yet it is here.	Eye ke hã ele afisia.
He will get there eventually.	Aɖo afima mlɔeba.
This never occurred to me.	Esia meva susu me nam kpɔ o.
Just not today.	Ðeko menye egbea o.
Or we can do it together.	Alo míate ŋu awɔe ɖekae.
He seemed very surprised.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ ene.
How will you come?	Aleke nàwɔ ava?
It’s a little weird.	Ewɔ nuku vie.
Let me explain that to you.	Mina maɖe nya ma me na mi.
It’s not quite right.	Menye ɖe wòle nyuie tututu o.
It is many things at once, yet none of them.	Enye nu geɖe zi ɖeka, ke hã wo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
It is a very good news.	Enye nya nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
But this, well this is different.	Gake esia, nyuie esia to vovo.
I do the same thing now.	Mewɔa nu ma ke fifia.
I am new to this and really need help with this.	Menye ame yeye le esia me eye mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ le esia ŋu.
He was happy to go with her.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ be yeayi kplii.
A dead man.	Ame kuku aɖe.
He could have done the opposite.	Ate ŋu awɔ nusi to vovo na ema hafi.
It will take months.	Awɔ ɣleti geɖe.
I want to know everything.	Medi be manya nusianu.
It has never been like that.	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o.
Not much more than that.	Menye nu geɖe wu ema o.
And part of me really wanted to.	Eye nye akpa aɖe di vevie be mawɔe.
And a snake, too.	Eye da aɖe hã.
That’s my job.	Emae nye nye dɔ.
The apartment was in the most convenient location.	Xɔa me nɔ teƒe si sɔ wu.
I had a job to do.	Dɔ nɔ asinye mawɔ.
It was a great house.	Aƒe gã aɖee wònye.
Everyone knows you are.	Amesiame nya be ènye.
This wasn’t the case.	Esia menɔ nenema o.
I've got you ma.	Menya mo ma.
Usually they have.	Zi geɖe la, wole wo si.
He couldn’t do that for her.	Mete ŋu wɔ nu ma nɛ o.
He handed me the gun.	Etsɔ tu la de asi nam.
Do your part and everything will work itself out.	Wɔ wò akpa dzi eye nusianu awɔ dɔ le eɖokui si.
Consider the current equity.	Bu ga si sɔ fifia ŋu kpɔ.
You are the first person.	Wòe nye ame gbãtɔ.

These guys are busy all day.	Ŋutsu siawo nɔa dɔ dzi ŋkeke bliboa.
Consider how many have lost.	Bu alesi ame geɖe bu ŋu kpɔ.

But that didn’t work.	Gake ema mewɔ dɔ o.

With that, move on.	Le ema me la, yi edzi.
I'll see you at school tomorrow.	Makpɔ wò le suku etsɔ.

More people, more food, coming for him.	Ame geɖe wu, nuɖuɖu geɖe wu, gbɔna nɛ.

Water returned to normal only two years later.	Tsi trɔ gbɔ va ɖo alesi wònɔ tsã le ƒe eve megbe ko.
It’s just here, in this room.	Afi sia koe wòle, le xɔ sia me.
For blood.	Na ʋu.
Ask people who have different opinions.	Bia ame siwo ƒe susu to vovo.
I told them that.	Megblɔ nya ma na wo.
Instead of one for each.	Le esi teƒe be woawɔ ɖeka na wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.

That’s what the morning will be for.	Ema tae ŋdi la anɔ.

Or somewhere in between.	Alo teƒe aɖe le wo dome.

The first time depends on time.	Ɣeyiɣi gbãtɔ nɔ te ɖe ɣeyiɣi dzi.
The meeting lasted nearly two hours.	Kpekpea xɔ gaƒoƒo eve kloe.
You can do the same thing.	Wò hã àte ŋu awɔ nu ma ke.
Mine is better than that.	Nye tɔ nyo wu.
This also seems realistic.	Esia hã dze abe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
And you can’t do it.	Eye màte ŋui o.
However, we know that the current strategy isn’t working.	Ke hã, míenya be aɖaŋu si li fifia mele dɔ wɔm o.
But there is absolutely no help for these people.	Gake kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke kura meli na ame siawo o.
I’ve made one.	Mewɔ ɖeka.
I believe in them.	Mexɔ wo dzi se.
Or to any of them.	Alo na wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
But things weren’t quite the same.	Gake nuwo menɔ abe tsã ene tututu o.
I will be like that.	Manɔ nenema.
Finally the truth came out.	Mlɔeba nyateƒea va do.
He collapsed in anger.	Edze anyi le dziku me.
This is usually not possible.	Zi geɖe la, esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
We have to do something.	Ele be míawɔ nane.
In my heart of the matter.	Le nye dzi me.
This seems quite reasonable.	Esia dze abe susu le eme kura ene.
I have never seen this before.	Nyemekpɔ esia kpɔ o.
I would have done the same.	Anye ne nye hã mawɔ nenema ke.
I had to make two rooms.	Ele be mawɔ xɔ eve.
Your reputation precedes you.	Wò ŋkɔ nyui do ŋgɔ na wò.
I have never seen one.	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke kpɔ o.
Meet with him.	Do go kplii.
His car was still there.	Eƒe ʋua gakpɔtɔ nɔ afima.
But still, it’s not surprising.	Gake ke hã, mewɔ nuku o.
He lives alone.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔa agbe.
All things that are not really true.	Nu siwo katã menye nyateƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
You can’t reach these people.	Màte ŋu aɖo ame siawo gbɔ o.
He knew nothing about this.	Menya naneke tso esia ŋu o.
Otherwise, he wouldn’t.	Ne menye nenema o la, mawɔe nenema o.
He cannot hear his own voice.	Mate ŋu ase eya ŋutɔ ƒe gbe o.
It doesn’t do much.	Mewɔa dɔ boo aɖeke o.
It’s not like you’ve created an original idea.	Menye abe ɖe nèwɔ susu gbãtɔ aɖe ene o.
He will do whatever he can.	Awɔ nusianu si wòate ŋui.
It was a surprise to them.	Ewɔ nuku na wo.

There is definitely a problem.	Kuxi aɖe le eme godoo.

As long as your not interested.	Zi alesi wò metsɔ ɖeke le eme o ko.
No way.	Mɔ meli o.
I can do anything for you.	Mate ŋu awɔ nu sia nu na wò.
Something in my ear.	Nane le nye to me.
It didn’t occur to him.	Meva susu me nɛ o.
Always leave time for meals.	Gblẽ ɣeyiɣi ɖi na nuɖuɖu ɣesiaɣi.
I don’t really know.	Nyemenya tututu o.
They only have my word.	Nye nya koe le wo si.

For the reasons that.	Le susu siwo tae.
I don’t know how to find them.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ akpɔ wo o.
But no one will do it.	Gake ame aɖeke mawɔe o.
I am not in a good place.	Nyemele teƒe nyui aɖeke o.
You just have to tell them, that’s all.	Ðeko wòle be nàgblɔ na wo be, ema koe nye ema.
He is a happy person.	Enye ame si kpɔa dzidzɔ.
It was just that way.	Ðeko wònɔ nenema.
But he is no longer in that.	Gake megale nya ma me o.
Good sense and.	Susu nyui kple.
I never saw anyone with him.	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke kplii kpɔ o.
But be careful.	Gake kpɔ nyuie.
For a good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe tae.
He wouldn’t have wanted that.	Anye ne madi nenema o.
It’s in my car.	Ele nye ʋu me.
Time was like nothing.	Ɣeyiɣi nɔ abe naneke meli o ene.
He was also a teacher.	Enye nufiala hã.
This is not a normal system.	Esia menye ɖoɖo si sɔ o.
Everyone is right.	Ame sia ame ƒe nya le eteƒe.
Speak to me, please.	Ƒo nu nam.
He really doesn’t care about anyone or anything.	Le nyateƒe me la, metsɔ ɖeke le ame aɖeke alo naneke me o.
But he made a mistake.	Gake ewɔ vodada.
But that was on the side, like.	Gake ema nɔ akpa dzi, abe.
I have two great kids.	Vi gã eve le asinye.
But I doubt if there are very many children like you.	Gake meke ɖi ne ɖevi geɖe ŋutɔ li abe wò ene.
If we’re going to do this together.	Ne míele nu sia wɔ ge ɖekae la.

But the job was easy.	Gake dɔa wɔwɔ nɔ bɔbɔe.

Maybe he’s busy.	Ðewohĩ vovo mele eŋu o.
I remember exactly what that room looked like.	Meɖo ŋku alesi tututu xɔ ma nɔ dzi.
He will obviously have more than that.	Edze ƒã be nu geɖe wu ema anɔ esi.
He wasn’t in the house at all.	Menɔ aƒea me kura o.

He did not answer the dog.	Meɖo eŋu na avu la o.
A few things happened this week.	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo dzɔ le kwasiɖa sia me.

And that has worked for us so far.	Eye ema wɔ dɔ na mí vaseɖe fifia.
Many people have already died.	Ame geɖe ku xoxo.
Start with two hours.	Dze egɔme kple gaƒoƒo eve.

He didn’t understand what was going on.	Mese nu si nɔ edzi yim la gɔme o.

That's good for me.	Ema nyo nam.
Something was definitely not right there.	Nane menɔ anyi nyuie le afima o godoo.
You can do anything.	Àte ŋu awɔ nusianu.
There was nothing in my head.	Naneke menɔ nye ta me o.
This new model has a high-performance engine.	Mɔ̃ si wɔa dɔ nyuie le mɔ̃ yeye sia si.
Something really appeals to us.	Nane dzɔa dzi na mí ŋutɔ.

Yet there was something different.	Ke hã nane nɔ anyi si to vovo na esia.
From the back of a horse.	Tso sɔ aɖe ƒe megbe.
Maybe there will be something.	Ðewohĩ nane anɔ anyi.
But each of us has to live our own lives.	Gake ele be mía dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe nanɔ agbe le eya ŋutɔ ƒe agbe me.

They are smaller than before.	Wole sue wu tsã.
That day, my life changed.	Gbe ma gbe la, nye agbe trɔ.
He didn’t want to do things he knew would help him.	Medi be yeawɔ nu siwo yenya be akpe ɖe ye ŋu o.
Not at all.	Menye nenema kura o.
I’ve done things before.	Mewɔ nuwo kpɔ.
He has plenty of them.	Wo sɔ gbɔ ɖe esi.
He did what had to be done.	Ewɔ nusi wòle be woawɔ.
I think it’s true.	Mesusu be enye nyateƒe.
But he won’t have it.	Gake manɔ esi o.
He was never planning.	Menɔ ɖoɖo wɔm gbeɖe o.
No one knows what happened.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi dzɔ o.
But I doubt I can do this.	Gake meke ɖi be mate ŋu awɔ esia.
One can find everything there.	Ame ate ŋu akpɔ nusianu le afima.
Hopefully you know what you’re doing.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be ènya nusi wɔm nèle.
That surprised him.	Ema wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
And that worked very well.	Eye ema wɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
What is it for you?.	Nukae nye na wò?.
There can only be one thing.	Nu ɖeka koe ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
As a result, some homes were damaged.	Esia wɔe be aƒe aɖewo gblẽ.

Look at what they are offering.	Lé ŋku ɖe nu siwo wole nam la ŋu.
Some of them are missing.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo bu.
However, this task is difficult.	Ke hã, dɔ sia sesẽ.

Look at it here.	Kpɔ ɖa le afisia.
It didn’t surprise us.	Mewɔ nuku na mí o.
I'm sure of it.	Meka ɖe edzi.
And he may not be the only one.	Eye ɖewohĩ menye eya ɖeka koe o.
Please let me know if you have any ideas.	Taflatse na manya ne susu aɖe le asiwò.
It’s a real book, through and through.	Enye agbalẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ, to eme kple edzi.
You’re the one who takes care of me.	Wòe kpɔa dzinye.
There’s something wrong with it, you know.	Nane gblẽ le eŋu, ènya.
It’s as simple as it gets.	Ele bɔbɔe abe alesi wòle ene.
I will do something good today.	Mawɔ nu nyui aɖe egbea.
It’s not exciting enough.	Menye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ale gbegbe o.
You can fight this.	Àte ŋu awɔ avu kple esia.
I think he’s smart.	Mesusu be edze aɖaŋu.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.

As a result of this.	Esia wɔe be.
He had a job to do.	Dɔ nɔ esi wòawɔ.
Think about it for real.	Bu eŋu kpɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He’s better off with it.	Eƒe nɔnɔme le nyuie wu kplii.
Someone with a fresh face.	Ame aɖe si ƒe mo le yeye.
One day, no problems.	Ŋkeke ɖeka, kuxi aɖeke manɔmee.
But there are also paradoxes.	Gake nya siwo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu hã li.
He wasn’t here for them.	Menye wo tae wònɔ afisia o.
You know he will do it himself.	Ènya be eya ŋutɔ awɔe.
I missed them last night, and wondered what it was.	Mesusu wo le zã si va yi me, eye mebia ɖokuinye be nukae wònye hã.
I hope I was clear.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be me kɔ hafi.
And it seems to have worked.	Eye edze abe ewɔ dɔ ene.
He was just enjoying himself.	Ðeko wònɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm.
He wouldn’t want to have that.	Madi be ema nanɔ ye si o.
John was knocked down by a car.	Ʋu aɖe ƒo John ɖe anyi.

A simple day.	Ŋkeke si le bɔbɔe.
That’s not an issue.	Ema menye nya aɖeke o.
Check out the characteristics.	Kpɔ ale si wòle ɖa.
It’s definitely a big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe godoo.

This helped me a lot.	Esia kpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ.

Please stand back.	Taflatse tsi tre ɖe megbe.
I really didn’t have time this year.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye le ƒe sia me o.
And nobody did that.	Eye ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
One person died late.	Ame ɖeka ku megbe.
I have never seen one.	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke kpɔ o.
I know how to get there now.	Menya alesi mawɔ aɖo afima fifia.
A lot of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
Look, it’s just a matter of time.	Kpɔ ɖa, ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
He didn’t say much.	Megblɔ nya geɖe o.
I couldn’t do it.	Nyemete ŋu wɔe o.
This is all there will be.	Esia koe anɔ anyi.
I was very much under his watch.	Menɔ eƒe ŋku te ŋutɔ.
And that’s not necessarily a bad thing.	Eye esia menye nu gbegblẽ kokoko o.
And yet that is necessary.	Eye ke hã ema hiã.
You weren’t yourself last night.	Menye wò ŋutɔ nènye le zã si va yi me o.
That was very exciting for me.	Ema do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
Get out of your mind.	Do go le wò susu me.
It was a kind of fire.	Dzo ƒomevi aɖee wònye.
He tried harder to stay focused.	Edze agbagba vevie wu be yeƒe susu nanɔ nu ŋu.
It won’t bother some people.	Maɖe fu na ame aɖewo o.
I know they will do well together.	Menya be woawɔ nu nyuie ɖekae.
It’s a real job.	Enye dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This project requires a great deal of organization.	Dɔ sia bia be woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe nu ŋu nyuie ŋutɔ.
I'm just interested in what it is.	Ðeko metsɔ ɖe le nusi wònye me.
But trust me, this is important.	Gake ka ɖe dzinye, esia le vevie.
That seems likely.	Edze abe ema anya wɔ ene.
Life goes on, you know.	Agbe yi edzi, ènya.
However, it is.	Ke hã, ele nenema.
Or if someone is there.	Alo ne ame aɖe le afima.
The police are raiding this house.	Kpovitɔwo le aƒe sia dzi dzem.
That was only one hour.	Ga ɖeka koe nye ema.
It will not be available to all.	Manɔ anyi na amewo katã o.
These books are lost.	Agbalẽ siawo bu.
It was a pleasure to meet you.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò.
But there is good news.	Gake nya nyui aɖe li.
That’s a good thing how would you.	Ema nye nu nyui aleke nàwɔ.
I understand what happened there.	Mese nusi dzɔ le afima gɔme.
But, it doesn’t work so well in real situation.	Gake, mewɔa dɔ nyuie nenema gbegbe le nɔnɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ me o.
Not much going on there.	Menye nu geɖe mele edzi yim le afima o.
Perhaps he can do the same.	Ðewohĩ eya hã ate ŋu awɔe nenema.
He has to do a better job.	Ele be wòawɔ dɔ si nyo wu.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I should be more important than that.	Ele be manɔ vevie wu ema.
If he doesn’t want to do something, he doesn’t.	Ne medi be yeawɔ nane o la, ke mewɔe o.
And it shouldn’t surprise anyone.	Eye mele be wòawɔ nuku na ame aɖeke o.
Believe me, that stuff is really, really good.	Xɔ dzinye se, nu ma nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This seems to work well.	Edze abe esia wɔa dɔ nyuie ene.
This surprised me a lot.	Esia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I think go ahead.	Mesusu be yi edzi.
He had to make music.	Ele nɛ be wòawɔ ha.
The snake rushed into the house without hurry.	Da la ƒu du yi aƒea me kaba manɔmee.
I don’t think there are any rules.	Nyemesusu be se aɖeke li o.
It was very pleasant to him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I don’t really want the truth.	Nyemedi nyateƒea ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
But not often enough.	Gake menye zi geɖe o.
For whatever good that would do.	Le nyui ɖesiaɖe si ema awɔ ta.
We don’t know much more than that.	Míenya nu geɖe wu ema o.
I just couldn’t find any.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeke ŋu o.
I heard them, clear as a bell.	Mese wo, eme kɔ abe gaƒoƒo ene.
He had made mistakes.	Ewɔ vodada kpɔ.
Partly at the same time.	Akpa aɖe le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me.
I was so nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ale gbegbe.
But he wasn’t alone.	Gake menye eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi o.
But I didn’t have to do that.	Gake mehiã be mawɔ nenema o.
It will take years.	Axɔ ƒe geɖe.
It was so sick to me.	Edze dɔ nam ale gbegbe.
That would be a lot of work.	Ema anye dɔ geɖe ŋutɔ.
You can still live.	Àte ŋu anɔ agbe kokoko.
Home again, home again.	Aƒe ake, aƒeme ake.
It was a beautiful place.	Teƒe nyui aɖee wònye.
I can’t hear about that.	Nyemate ŋu ase nu tso nya ma ŋu o.

It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
The same person since he was in the police force.	Ame ma ke tso esime wònɔ kpovitɔwo dome.
That’s old school.	Ema nye suku xoxo aɖe.
Today nothing can be found here.	Egbea naneke mate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu le afisia o.
I couldn’t get rid of any bullets.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe tu aɖeke ɖa o.
It wasn’t morning for him yet.	Ŋdi meɖo nɛ haɖe o.
You’ve been very pleased.	Edzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ.
This is legally binding.	Esia le se nu.
Longitudinal strategy.	Aɖaŋu si woawɔ le mɔ didi nu.
I do have a point though.	Nya aɖe le asinye gake.
This is too much for you.	Esia sɔ gbɔ akpa na wò.
I'm pretty sure you don't know what that means.	Meka ɖe edzi tututu be mènya nusi ema fia o.
A book is missing.	Agbalẽ aɖe bu.
Who is that guy?	Amekae nye ŋutsu ma?
But that wasn’t his way.	Gake menye emae nye eƒe mɔ o.
Or some other lie.	Alo alakpa bubu aɖe.
Back to the menu.	Trɔ yi nuɖuɖu siwo le eme la gbɔ.
It seems like it seems.	Edze abe edze abe.
Just please call.	Ðeko taflatse ƒo ka.
He never makes a mistake.	Mewɔa vodada gbeɖe o.
But we don’t have that.	Gake ema mele mía si o.
I don’t know myself.	Nyemenya ɖokuinye o.
I am here, my word.	Mele afisia, nye nya la.
He never said a word to her.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke nɛ kpɔ o.
This is really interesting.	Esia doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
What can I do about it.	Nukae mate ŋu awɔ.
I’m asking for money for food.	Me le ga biam ɖe nuɖuɖu ta.
That, too, is a lie.	Ema hã nye alakpa.
Someone knows all about us.	Ame aɖe nya nu tso mía ŋu katã.
When was that time? 	Ɣekaɣie nye ema?
. . . .	.
He couldn't concentrate on anything.	Mete ŋu tsɔ eƒe susu ɖo nu aɖeke ŋu o.
That was a big deal for me.	Ema nye nu gã aɖe nam.
He was such a pushover.	Enye ame si ƒoa eɖokui ɖe nu me alea gbegbe.
It surprised me, too.	Ewɔ nuku nam hã.
It was a house.	Aƒe aɖee wònye.
That’s a bad thing.	Ema nye nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
It doesn’t matter at all.	Mele vevie kura o.
Two things impressed me deeply.	Nu eve aɖewo wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye vevie.
But there was one problem with this idea.	Gake kuxi ɖeka aɖe nɔ susu sia ŋu.
But you can do this for me.	Gake àte ŋu awɔ esia nam.
This surprised everyone.	Nya sia wɔ nuku na amesiame.
And they’re fine.	Eye wole nyuie.
He'll probably be ready for that.	Anye be anɔ klalo na ema.
Another was the same.	Bubu hã nɔ nenema ke.
This house is a part of us.	Aƒe sia nye míaƒe akpa aɖe.
He is, of course, interested.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme na ame ya.
We have a little time though.	Ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe le mía si gake.
But there to be a way.	Gake afi ma be mɔ aɖe nanɔ anyi.
It can save lives.	Ate ŋu axɔ amewo ɖe agbe.
Let’s try something completely different.	Mina míate nusi to vovo kura kpɔ.
He couldn’t understand it.	Mete ŋu se egɔme o.
You are not the only person doing the work.	Menye ame ɖeka si le dɔa wɔm koe nènye o.
Everyone died.	Ame sia ame ku.
Had it been simpler though.	Ne ɖe wòle bɔbɔe wu la, anye ne mewɔe nenema o ke hã.
Just a little bit.	Vi aɖe ko.
I wasn’t really sure about anything.	Nyemeka ɖe naneke dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Much still needs to be done.	Nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ hiã be woawɔ.
I know this can’t be what you want.	Menya be esia mate ŋu anye nusi dim nèle o.
But that wasn’t all he used to be.	Gake menye ema koe wònye tsã.
This is likely to be very disturbing.	Anɔ eme be esia aɖe fu na ame ŋutɔ.
The smoke headed my way.	Dzudzɔ la ɖo ta nye mɔ dzi.
It worked for him.	Ewɔ dɔ nɛ.
Perhaps you are really busy.	Ðewohĩ vovo mele ŋuwò ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Now everything is behind schedule.	Fifia nusianu tsi megbe.
But he couldn’t see anything.	Gake mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
It was a very expensive car.	Enye ʋu si xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
For his neck.	Na eƒe kɔ.
There were obviously a lot of people who were very upset.	Edze ƒã be ame geɖe nɔ anyi siwo do dziku ŋutɔ.
I am going through a difficult situation.	Mele nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe me tom.
All the money is gone.	Ga la katã nu yi.
I will take care of this.	Makpɔ esia gbɔ.
It needs some time.	Ehiã ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
There are aspects of that.	Ema ƒe akpa aɖewo li.
I will call if anything comes up.	Maƒo ka ne nane do mo ɖa.
Everyone else left.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe dzo.
He can be rational but have no real reason.	Ate ŋu anye amesi si susu le gake susu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke manɔ esi o.
It seems like a new thing.	Edze abe nu yeye ene.
Be a big part of it.	Nye eƒe akpa gã aɖe.
Every day the air gets more polluted.	Gbe sia gbe la, ya la va nɔa ɖi ƒom ɖe edzi.
If anyone can help, please do.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu la, taflatse wɔe.

This is not consistent.	Esia mewɔ ɖeka o.
And you can tell that in the room.	Eye àte ŋu anya ema le xɔa me.
He will be in good health.	Eƒe lãme anɔ nyuie.
Let me explain what happened.	Mina maɖe nusi dzɔ la me.

I recognized them all.	Mekpɔ wo katã dze sii.
This will come as no surprise to anyone.	Esia mawɔ nuku na ame aɖeke o.
I can’t let you go.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le ŋuwò o.
Everyone will believe it.	Ame sia ame axɔ edzi ase.
Let’s do our job.	Mina míawɔ míaƒe dɔ.
I think we can do it.	Mesusu be míate ŋui.
You can work your way up from there.	Àte ŋu awɔ dɔ tso afima yi dzi.
Good morning to you.	Ŋdi nyui na wò.
This made me angry.	Esia na medo dziku.
But it is not at all.	Gake menye nenema kura o.
For a very long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
A statement that reveals.	Nya aɖe si ɖe nu fia.
Actually, that’s not all that important.	Le nyateƒe me la, menye ema koe le vevie nenema gbegbe o.
The air is hot.	Ya la xɔ dzo.
I’ve always liked her so much.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ale gbegbe ɣesiaɣi.
I'd better book into it.	Anyo be mawɔ agbalẽ ɖe eme.
Many of them didn’t make sense.	Susu menɔ wo dometɔ geɖe me o.
Press it down.	Zi edzi ɖe anyi.
Something good happened to him.	Nu nyui aɖe dzɔ ɖe edzi.
That has changed.	Ema trɔ.
He didn’t know what was going on.	Menya nusi nɔ edzi yim o.
He can do anything to them and deal with them.	Ate ŋu awɔ nu sia nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu eye wòawɔ nu kpli wo.
He should be able to.	Ele be wòate ŋui.
There was no one behind him.	Ame aɖeke menɔ megbe nɛ o.
But that sounds great.	Gake nya ma ɖi ŋutɔ.
There is a time for everything.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe li na nusianu.
Nothing could have saved any of us.	Naneke mate ŋu axɔ na mía dometɔ aɖeke hafi o.
But you can’t stay late.	Gake màte ŋu anɔ anyi tsi megbe o.
I can never escape it.	Nyemate ŋu asi le enu gbeɖe o.
And we don’t know anything about it.	Eye míenya naneke tso eŋu o.
It is a system.	Enye ɖoɖo aɖe.
It shouldn’t be a surprise.	Mele be wòawɔ nuku na ame o.
He can talk now.	Ate ŋu aƒo nu fifia.
Please try to do the same.	Taflatse dze agbagba nàwɔ nenema ke.
Stick to me.	Lé ɖe ŋunye.
I can’t be like that.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
But he never did anything.	Gake mewɔ naneke kpɔ o.
Soil .	Ke .
Death cannot take that away.	Ku mate ŋu aɖe ema ɖa o.
He doesn’t have time for this.	Ɣeyiɣi mele esi na esia o.
Be really careful.	Kpɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We must	Ele be míawɔ .
Not much of a surprise.	Mewɔ nuku boo aɖeke o.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
It is obviously impossible.	Edze ƒã be manya wɔ o.
I'll keep your name out of that, too.	Maɖe wò ŋkɔ ɖa le ema hã me.

Still, that was enough time.	Ke hã, ɣeyiɣi ma sɔ gbɔ.
The highway is notorious for its potholes.	Mɔ gã la xɔ ŋkɔ le do siwo le eme ta.
If not, let me know.	Ne menye nenema o la, na manya.
He had been surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ kpɔ.
It still makes no sense.	Susu aɖeke mele eme kokoko o.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Something must be seriously wrong with this kid.	Ele be nane gblẽ vevie le ɖevi sia ŋu.
There are a few possibilities.	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo li siwo ate ŋu adzɔ.
His attention was on me.	Eƒe susu nɔ ŋunye.
It’s not just one thing.	Menye nu ɖeka koe wòle o.
He wouldn’t allow that.	Maɖe mɔ nenema o.
I haven’t heard anything about it yet.	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso eŋu haɖe o.
Please do it for me.	Taflatse wɔe nam.
Again, nothing came of it.	Le afisia hã la, naneke medo tso eme o.

But in a new way.	Gake le mɔ yeye aɖe nu.
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
I would like some water, please.	Taflatse, madi tsi aɖe.
It will be the same.	Anye ɖeka ma ke.
Only life can create life.	Agbe koe ate ŋu awɔ agbe.

Build or make something.	Tu nane alo wɔe.
There is no help there.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke meli le afima o.
It's a little something that knows about it.	Enye nu sue aɖe si nya nu tso eŋu.

This means we can make more money.	Esia fia be míate ŋu akpɔ ga geɖe.

This is something else.	Esia nye nu bubu aɖe.
And maybe there’s a good thing in that.	Eye ɖewohĩ nu nyui aɖe le ema me.

And he’s not the only one.	Eye menye eya ɖeka koe o.

Everything happened at the same time.	Nusianu dzɔ le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
It was incredibly bad.	Enye nu gbegblẽ si mexɔ se o.

You definitely have plenty of space.	Teƒe geɖe le asiwò godoo.
No one could remember there being one.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi be ɖeka li o.
I only remember it in my own room.	Nye ŋutɔ nye xɔ me koe meɖo ŋku edzi.

So tell me a little bit about yourself.	Eya ta gblɔ wò nya vi aɖe nam.

No one can do it better.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu o.

Only one of us is still alive.	Mía dometɔ ɖeka koe gakpɔtɔ le agbe.
He wasn’t happy for long.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ eteƒe didi o.
His heart was changed.	Eƒe dzi trɔ.
There wasn’t much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
But this seems like a bad thing.	Gake esia dze abe nu gbegblẽ ene.

It’s not here at all.	Mele afisia kura o.
Everyone knew how to deal with them.	Amesiame nya alesi wòawɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋui.
Everything and everyone.	Nusianu kple amesiame.
Check them out right now!	Kpɔ wo ɖa fifia ko!
I can have anything.	Nusianu ate ŋu anɔ asinye.
But he did something wrong that night.	Gake ewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖe le zã ma me.
It will be my heart.	Anye nye dzi.
He really didn’t care about anything.	Le nyateƒe me la, metsɔ ɖeke le naneke me o.
An idea came to him.	Susu aɖe va susu me nɛ.
I could never stay.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi gbeɖe o.
It could be great again.	Ate ŋu anye nu gã aɖe ake.
Compare this to that.	Tsɔ esia sɔ kple ema.
He had never been without blood.	Menɔ ʋu manɔmee kpɔ o.
Someone else said it was.	Ame bubu aɖe gblɔ be ele nenema.
Please help me out.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye.

It’s a strategy.	Enye aɖaŋu aɖe.

Confirm a good point.	Kpe nya nyui aɖe dzi.
But on the other hand, there was not so much.	Gake le go bubu me la, menɔ anyi nenema gbegbe o.
That wouldn’t work.	Ema mawɔ dɔ o.
The same is true here.	Nenema ke le afisia hã.
A few weeks here and there.	Kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo le afisia kple afima.
I have no problem with it.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ŋunye le eŋu o.
I can’t explain it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eme o.
That teaches us.	Ema fia mí.
But all the time, we are fighting.	Gake ɣesiaɣi la, míele avu wɔm.
His house is nearby.	Eƒe aƒe la te ɖe eŋu.
They are easy to make.	Wo wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe.
Perhaps there are good reasons.	Ðewohĩ susu nyui aɖewo li siwo tae.
They had a reason.	Susu aɖe nɔ wo si.
Discover them.	Ke ɖe wo ŋu.
In two parts.	Le akpa eve wɔwɔ me.
A nice person to deal with.	Ame nyui aɖe si woawɔ nu kplii.
But still he didn’t give up.	Gake ke hã meɖe asi le eŋu o.
He didn’t like any part of it.	Eƒe akpa aɖeke medze eŋu o.
Nothing too bothersome.	Naneke meɖe fu na ame akpa o.
I never wanted anything more.	Nyemedi naneke wu esia kpɔ o.
And think about it.	Eye bu eŋu kpɔ.
No one will ever know.	Ame aɖeke manya gbeɖe o.
This usually takes about an hour.	Zi geɖe la, esia xɔa abe gaƒoƒo ɖeka ene.
It’s too important.	Ele vevie akpa.
Not that one though.	Menye ɖeka ma o ke hã.
But this is a reality.	Gake esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It is at least something.	Enye nane ya teti.
But that’s a little different.	Gake ema to vovo vie.
And the water, too.	Eye tsi hã.
Or two weeks.	Alo kwasiɖa eve.
Do write to me soon.	Do ŋlɔ agbalẽ nam kpuie.
He was a good child.	Vi nyui aɖee wònye.

That night we can’t remember.	Zã ma me la, míate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi o.
This is a complete waste of time.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ kura.
This project was relatively easy.	Dɔ sia nɔ bɔbɔe vie.
What do you think of that?	Nukae nèsusu tso nya ma ŋu?
It had been a great year for him.	Ƒe gã aɖee wònye nɛ tsã.
It seems so easy!.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe ale gbegbe ene!.
I'm just here.	Ðeko mele afisia.
However, he didn’t.	Ke hã, mewɔe nenema o.
He is the only one who can save us.	Eya koe ate ŋu aɖe mí.
I had to tell him something.	Ele be magblɔ nya aɖe nɛ.
He couldn’t remember.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi o.
That’s the quality you’re looking for.	Emae nye nɔnɔme si dim nèle.
But this case is different.	Gake nya sia ya to vovo.
That’s just a difficult thing.	Nu sesẽ aɖe koe nye ema.
I wanted this way.	Medi mɔ sia.
It would be a great thing.	Anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I miss you a lot too.	Nye hã mesusu wò ŋutɔ.
His head is broken.	Eƒe ta gblẽ.
Thank you, once again, for the truth.	Akpe na mi, zi ɖeka, ɖe nyateƒea ta.
However, there is no clothing.	Ke hã, awu aɖeke meli o.
That’s not true here.	Ema menye nyateƒe le afisia o.
To comply with it.	Be woawɔ ɖe edzi.
Yet it doesn’t work.	Ke hã mewɔa dɔ o.
This was bad last year	Esia gblẽ nu le ƒe si va yi me
I had no words to tell him about his work.	Nya aɖeke menɔ asinye be magblɔ eƒe dɔa nɛ o.
I know how busy you are.	Menya alesi gbegbe vovo mele ŋuwò o.
And it’s amazing.	Eye wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
What do you think will happen to him?	Nu kae nèsusu be ava dzɔ ɖe edzi?
That was my opportunity.	Emae nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ nam.
There was more space inside.	Teƒe geɖe wu nɔ eme.
Maybe I will do that.	Ðewohĩ mawɔe nenema.
As long as he was happy.	Zi alesi wònɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm ko la.
People fell into each other, fell.	Amewo ge ɖe wo nɔewo me, dze anyi.
Do go with.	Do go le.
I am doing a lot of work.	Mele dɔ geɖe wɔm.
There was a lot in between.	Nu geɖe nɔ wo dome.
If not, you can do it.	Ne meli o la, àte ŋu awɔe.
Look at each situation carefully on its own.	Lé ŋku ɖe nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe ŋu nyuie le eɖokui si.
You shouldn’t do this.	Mele be nàwɔ esia o.
I couldn’t hear it.	Nyemete ŋu se nu o.
That it is somehow wrong.	Be enye nu gbegblẽ le mɔ aɖe nu.
It’s easy, right?	Ele bɔbɔe, alo?
This is a lie.	Esia nye alakpa.
I'm sure this is a bad idea.	Meka ɖe edzi be susu gbegblẽ aɖee nye esia.

Or last night.	Alo etsɔ zã me.
I want to work with you.	Medi be mawɔ dɔ kpli wò.
This is true, of course.	Esia nye nyateƒe ya.
And that worked.	Eye ema wɔ dɔ.
That’s my reality.	Emae nye nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I need you right now.	Mehiã wò fifia.
You don’t know how you got there.	Mènya alesi nèwɔ va ɖo afima o.
This isn’t surprising.	Esia mewɔ nuku o.
I have to stay.	Ele be manɔ anyi.
His voice was impressive.	Eƒe gbe wɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
At his feet.	Le eƒe afɔ me.
You don’t have anything.	Naneke mele asiwò o.
But this work is interesting.	Gake dɔ sia doa dzidzɔ na ame.
Something is wrong there.	Nane gblẽ le afima.
I am going to listen rather than talk.	Mele to ɖo ge tsɔ wu be maƒo nu.
But that’s not why.	Gake menye esia tae o.
Trust me on that one.	Ka ɖe dzinye le ɖeka ma dzi.
And there was no music.	Eye ha aɖeke menɔ anyi o.

Now it is impossible.	Fifia manya wɔ o.
This would be a great thing.	Esia anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
but he can’t quite do that.	gake mate ŋu awɔ ema tututu o.
There is no other person.	Ame bubu aɖeke meli o.
A man with a gun opened fire.	Ŋutsu aɖe si si tu nɔ la da tu.
Just not really good at all.	Ðeko menye nu nyui aɖeke ŋutɔŋutɔ kura o.
This is very problematic.	Esia nye kuxi ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t live with them, not like this.	Mete ŋu nɔ agbe kpli wo o, menye alea o.
So much time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe ŋutɔ va yi.
His voice was different now.	Eƒe gbe to vovo fifia.
That would probably be easier.	Anɔ eme be ema anɔ bɔbɔe wu.
I did this for a couple of reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae mewɔ esia ɖo.
I’m sure we can handle this.	Meka ɖe edzi be míate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ.
I knew he wouldn’t last until he got close.	Menya be manɔ anyi vaseɖe esime wòate ɖe eŋu o.

The opposite is true.	Nusi to vovo na emae nye nyateƒe.
The trend is up.	Nusi le edzi yim la le dzi yim.
But this is true only to a certain extent.	Gake esia nye nyateƒe vaseɖe afi aɖe ko.
Nothing has ever worked.	Naneke mewɔ dɔ kpɔ o.
I thought you were alone.	Mesusu be wò ɖeka koe li.

Death to his people.	Ku na eƒe amewo.
But that was a long time ago.	Gake ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye ema va yi.
I shouldn’t have said that.	Mele be magblɔ nya ma hafi o.
There has to be something ahead.	Ele be nane nanɔ ŋgɔ.
You know what you have.	Ènya nu si le asiwò.
I never knew anyone like you.	Nyemenya ame aɖeke abe wò ene kpɔ o.
Not every night, of course.	Menye zã ɖesiaɖe ya o.
Something needs to be done to your mind.	Ele be woawɔ nane ɖe wò susu ŋu.
You never know!.	Mènya gbeɖe o!.
And that seems to be enough.	Eye edze abe ema sɔ gbɔ ene.
A lot of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
I want to marry a man with a good heart.	Medi be maɖe ŋutsu si si dzi nyui le.
We must act now.	Ele be míawɔ nu fifia.
He was a good guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖee wònye.
Here there are two possibilities.	Le afisia la, nu eve aɖewo li siwo ate ŋu adzɔ.
I know you can do this.	Menya be àte ŋu awɔ esia.
It’s an easy mistake to make.	Enye vodada bɔbɔe aɖe si woawɔ.
Now.	Fifia.
There seemed to be people there.	Edze abe amewo nɔ afima ene.
Nothing good seems to have come of it.	Edze abe nu nyui aɖeke medo tso eme o ene.
You need to do these two things before planning.	Ele be nàwɔ nu eve siawo hafi awɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
Almost a month before.	Ɣleti ɖeka kloe do ŋgɔ.
But it’s amazing.	Gake ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There is no place like home	Teƒe aɖeke meli abe aƒe ene o
He can be awake at any hour of the night.	Ate ŋu anɔ ŋu le zã ƒe gaƒoƒo ɖesiaɖe me.
He never wanted anything else.	Medi nu bubu aɖeke kpɔ o.
We hope this might be useful to you.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be ɖewohĩ esia aɖe vi na wò.
Please, sit down.	Meɖe kuku, nɔ anyi.
Look, it doesn’t matter.	Kpɔ ɖa, mehiã o.
That’s your leg.	Emae nye wò afɔ.
These statements are certainly correct.	Nya siawo sɔ godoo godoo.
That’s definitely something he can do.	Ema nye nusi wòate ŋu awɔ godoo.
You know what they have to do.	Ènya nu si wòle be woawɔ.

I know a lot about you.	Menya nu geɖe tso ŋuwò.
I think there's one near here.	Mesusu be ɖeka le afisia te ɖe afima ŋu.
He was interested to see what everyone had to say about it.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme be yeakpɔ nusi amesiame gblɔ tso eŋu.
He didn’t show up.	Meɖe eɖokui fia o.
The issue will be a disturbing one.	Nya la anye nya si aɖe fu na ame.
I had quite a dog.	Avu aɖe nɔ asinye ŋutɔ.
Annual.	Ƒe sia ƒe.
Can anyone out there help me with this please.	Ðe ame aɖe le afima ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye le esia me taflatse.
He had a character.	Nɔnɔme nɔ esi.
It’s true, it’s true.	Enye nyateƒe, enye nyateƒe.
I didn’t know you were like that.	Nyemenya be èle nenema o.
Who is he, anyway? 	Amekae nye eya?

They have to be joined.	Ele be woawɔ ɖeka kpli wo.
Clearly, we cannot sit back and hope that this situation will improve.	Edze ƒã be míate ŋu anɔ anyi anɔ mɔ kpɔm be nɔnɔme sia anyo ɖe edzi o.
I have some food for you.	Nuɖuɖu aɖewo le asinye na wò.
Everyone kind of ran.	Amesiame ƒu du ƒomevi aɖe.
He could not have done that.	Mate ŋu awɔ ema hafi o.
The face is not one face.	Mo la menye mo ɖeka o.
Stand up for us.	Tsi tre ɖe mía ŋu.
Thousands of men.	Ŋutsu akpe geɖe.
And that’s very difficult.	Eye esia sesẽ ŋutɔ.
The king was very ill yesterday.	Fia la dze dɔ vevie etsɔ.
Maybe he did do something wrong and made a mistake.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖe nyateƒe eye wòwɔ vodada.
You know if that.	Ènya nenye be.

I wondered how he got there.	Mebia ɖokuinye be aleke wòwɔ va ɖo afima hã.

I think you’re onto something though.	Mesusu be èle nane dzi ke hã.
Use several small spaces instead of one large space.	Zã teƒe sue geɖe ɖe teƒe gã ɖeka teƒe.
But we can put that aside.	Gake míate ŋu aɖe nya ma ɖe vovo.

Yet it’s a bit weird, actually.	Ke hã ewɔ nuku vie, le nyateƒe me.
Be a better person.	Nye ame si nyo wu.
The market is warm.	Asi la xɔ dzo.
The issue is not new.	Nya la menye nu yeye o.
This is impossible to happen.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Turn off your mind.	Tsi wò susu.

But it didn’t come.	Gake meva o.
If you are looking for the same, please contact me.	Ne èle nu ma ke dim la, taflatse te ɖe ŋunye.
No man had ever looked like that.	Ŋutsu aɖeke medze nenema kpɔ o.
I will do that.	Mawɔe nenema.
But there are some exceptions.	Gake nu aɖewo li siwo to vovo na ema.
And that’s good for them.	Eye esia nyo na wo.
He lived alone in a small house.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ aƒe sue aɖe me.
In itself,.	Le eɖokui si la,.
He didn’t want to go there.	Medi be yeayi afima o.
I couldn’t answer them.	Nyemete ŋu ɖo eŋu na wo o.
I just said that.	Ðeko megblɔ be.
Which means that.	Nusi fia be.
But in reality, that mechanism did not emerge.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mɔ̃ ma medo mo ɖa o.
You seem to have a few parts by the same.	Edze abe akpa ʋɛ aɖewo le asiwò to ɖeka ma ke dzi ene.
No one else was there.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afima o.
That remains true.	Ema gakpɔtɔ nye nyateƒe.
I’m not sure it will ever happen.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be adzɔ gbeɖe o.
The night was hot and dusty.	Zã la xɔ dzo eye ke xɔ aƒe ɖe eme.
I knew that would go away.	Menya be ema nu ayi.
He never had his own room.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe xɔ menɔ esi kpɔ o.
We can’t tell.	Míate ŋu anya o.

People were eating.	Amewo nɔ nu ɖum.
There is nothing in between.	Naneke mele wo dome o.

He needed to stay focused.	Ehiã be eƒe susu nanɔ nu ŋu.

This actually happened.	Esia dzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t want to upset you.	Nyemedi be mado dziku na wò o.
It was so surreal.	Enye nusi me susu mele o ale gbegbe.
Or try to do something about it.	Alo dze agbagba nàwɔ nane tso eŋu.
It wouldn’t work the other way around.	Mawɔ dɔ le mɔ bubu nu o.
I’m the one who did this.	Nyee wɔ esia.
And maybe it doesn’t matter.	Eye ɖewohĩ mehiã o.
He didn’t answer at once.	Meɖo eŋu zi ɖeka o.
Something he had never seen before.	Nane si mekpɔ kpɔ o.
He had no water.	Tsi aɖeke menɔ esi o.
Speak when they speak to you.	Ƒo nu ne wole nu ƒom na wò.
He never stood up.	Metsi tre kpɔ o.
There will be death.	Ku anɔ anyi.
I don’t trust anyone that much.	Nyemeka ɖe ame aɖeke dzi nenema gbegbe o.
Something came to mind.	Nane va susu me nɛ.
It was never really an issue for us.	Menye nya ŋutɔŋutɔ na mí gbeɖe o.
That depends on what kind of person you are.	Ema nɔ te ɖe ame si ƒomevi nènye dzi.
Which is quite surprising.	Nusi wɔ nuku kura.
He had many good years here.	Ƒe nyui geɖe nɔ esi le afisia.
How everyone did it.	Ale si amesiame wɔe.
This means, that no temporal condition is required.	Esia fia, be ɣeyiɣi ƒe nɔnɔme aɖeke mehiã o.
This time, he really cares.	Fifia ya, etsɔ ɖe le eme na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
No one can do this for you.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ esia na wò o.
It will be so.	Anye nenema.

This section is excellent.	Akpa sia nyo ŋutɔ.
And here you are.	Eye wòe nye esi.
In fact, nothing concrete came of it.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke medo tso eme o.
Is that money?	Eya nye ga?
I don’t want to talk to you.	Nyemedi be maƒo nu kpli wò o.
A few people joined him.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo va kpe ɖe eŋu.

Just more than good.	Nusi wu nyui koe.
I just couldn’t do it.	Ðeko nyemete ŋui o.

But he couldn’t stop now.	Gake mete ŋu tɔ te fifia o.
We won’t have anyone long enough.	Ame aɖeke manɔ mía si ɣeyiɣi didi si sɔ o.
Stop the car.	Tsɔ ʋua tɔ.
Everyone can get the food they need.	Amesiame ate ŋu axɔ nuɖuɖu si hiã tu.
It’s a part of me.	Enye nye akpa aɖe.
You can’t get to that point.	Màte ŋu aɖo nya ma gbɔ o.
Yet he didn’t do that.	Ke hã mewɔe nenema o.

He was a good guy.	Ame nyui aɖee wònye.
I felt really weird.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Not at all.	Menye ɖeke o.
He had his time and place.	Eƒe ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe nɔ esi.
You have to do this.	Ele be nàwɔ esia.
Now comes the surprise.	Fifia nusi wɔ nuku la va ɖo.

Everything seems to be working.	Edze abe nusianu le dɔ wɔm ene.

But it didn’t start out that way.	Gake medze egɔme nenema o.
As far as we can tell, everyone was very happy.	Le míate ŋu anya nu la, amesiame kpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
It’s a perfect fit.	Enye nusi sɔ nyuie.
Look, there it is!	Kpɔ ɖa, le afima!
But somehow he couldn’t speak.	Gake le mɔ aɖe nu la, mete ŋu ƒoa nu o.
Everything explained so much.	Nusianu ɖe ​​nu geɖe me ale gbegbe.
There is a good reason for it.	Susu nyui aɖe li si tae.
But that wasn’t me.	Gake menye nyee nye ema o.

That’s a great thing.	Nu gã aɖee nye ema.
From hours to days or weeks.	Tso gaƒoƒo geɖe dzi va ɖo ŋkeke alo kwasiɖa geɖe dzi.
It could be something else.	Ate ŋu anye nu bubu aɖe.
He's trying, as much as he can right now.	Ele agbagba dzem, abe alesi wòate ŋui fifia ene.
I was surprised by this man's statement.	Ŋutsu sia ƒe nya sia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I have to do it.	Ele be mawɔe.

Take a closer look at this!	Kpɔ esia ɖa nyuie!
Come out and meet them.	Va do go wo.
You can answer it.	Àte ŋu aɖo eŋu.
The first is personal and too personal for anyone to ever know.	Gbãtɔ nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ eye wònye ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa be ame aɖeke mate ŋu anya gbeɖe o.
The people in it do not treat one another well.	Ame siwo le eme la mewɔa nu ɖe ​​wo nɔewo ŋu nyuie o.

That works pretty well too.	Ema hã wɔa dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.

Things are really bad.	Nuwo gblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t have to remove anything.	Mehiã be maɖe naneke ɖa o.
In some ways, that is true.	Le mɔ aɖewo nu la, nya ma nye nyateƒe.
Thank you so much for yours.	Akpe geɖe na wò.

He like many is one of a kind.	Eya abe ame geɖe ene la, enye ame ɖeka aɖe si ƒomevi wònye.
I couldn’t control myself.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ ɖokuinye dzi o.
There were two in one person.	Eve nɔ ame ɖeka me.
There seems to be nothing.	Edze abe naneke meli o ene.
They will have free time.	Vovo anɔ wo ŋu.
I only glanced at him once.	Zi ɖeka koe meɖe ŋku ɖe eŋu.

I have felt that way many times.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ele nenema zi geɖe.

He was alone in his house.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ eƒe aƒea me.

It doesn’t matter.	Mehiã o.
I can’t remember what it was.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nusi wònye dzi o.
But it’s not that simple.	Gake menye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
I can’t say anything else.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya bubu aɖeke o.
I like what you have to say.	Nya si nàgblɔ la dzɔa dzi nam.
You can go anywhere.	Àte ŋu ayi afi sia afi.
Or what he was doing.	Alo nusi wɔm wònɔ.
They liked it.	Edze wo ŋu.
Exactly his own.	Eya ŋutɔ tɔ tututu.
I didn’t find any.	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke o.
A tooth, perhaps.	Aɖu aɖe, ɖewohĩ.
It is so it is not so.	Ele nenema menye nenema o.
I had never heard that song.	Nyemese ha ma kpɔ o.
The wind didn’t bother him.	Ya meɖe fu nɛ o.
He had a lot on his mind.	Nu geɖe nɔ susu me nɛ.
That’s the plan for you.	Emae nye ɖoɖo na wò.
Now that's pretty great!.	Fifia ema nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ!.
What is the real thing? 	Nukae nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ?
But what we do know about .	Gake nusi míenya tso .
Everything has a character.	Nɔnɔme le nusianu si.
Yours did the same.	Wò tɔ hã wɔe nenema.
Didi is not.	Didi ma ke.
This will either work or it won’t.	Esia awɔ dɔ alo mawɔ dɔ o.
In fact, no one went out or entered.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame aɖeke medo go alo ge ɖe eme o.
He was shocked by what happened.	Nusi dzɔ la wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
That’s my thing, right now.	Emae nye nye nya, fifia.
Go back to school.	Trɔ yi suku.
The main building was engulfed.	Xɔ gã la xɔ dzo.
He threw a rock at her.	Etsɔ kpe aɖe ƒu gbe ɖe eŋu.
It is, of course, fascinating.	Enye nusi dzɔa dzi na ame ya.
True.	Nyateƒe.
I was ready to go.	Menɔ klalo be mayi.
Great buy would definitely recommend.	Gã ƒle aɖo aɖaŋu godoo.
Unable.	Màte ŋui o.
He must have been so sick.	Anɔ eme be edze dɔ ale gbegbe.
You're not going to die.	Mèle kuku ge o.
I’m not quite ready.	Nyemele klalo tututu o.
Everyone does this.	Amesiame wɔa esia.
All who have heard.	Ame siwo katã se.
We will need to do something more difficult.	Ahiã be míawɔ nane si sesẽ wu.
The result was very disappointing.	Nusi do tso eme la ɖe dzi le ame ƒo ŋutɔ.
This one doesn’t.	Esia mewɔe nenema o.
You can’t make us do anything.	Màte ŋu ana míawɔ naneke o.
But there were also some serious problems.	Gake kuxi sesẽ aɖewo hã nɔ anyi.
He was scarcely pleased.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ƒã hafi.
But you can’t escape.	Gake màte ŋu asi o.
He couldn’t tell.	Mete ŋu nya o.
He never told me what it was.	Megblɔ nusi wònye nam kpɔ o.
But this is more than a few.	Gake esia de ŋgɔ wu ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
His anger seemed to get the better of him.	Edze abe eƒe dziku va ɖu edzi ene.
It is who he is.	Enye amesi wònye.
He seems like such a happy person.	Edze abe ame si kpɔa dzidzɔ alea ene.
I made a mistake.	Mewɔ vodada.
But never the first.	Gake menye gbãtɔ gbeɖe o.
Take a closer look at the object.	Lé ŋku ɖe nu la ŋu nyuie.
You can’t take them away from me.	Màte ŋu axɔ wo le asinye o.
No one believed him.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ edzi se o.
It didn’t do a good job at all.	Mewɔ dɔ nyui aɖeke kura o.
Everything seemed to go well.	Edze abe nusianu yi edzi nyuie ene.
But just about everyone else is pretty confident.	Gake ame bubu ɖesiaɖe kloe ka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
Or something more than that.	Alo nusi wu ema.
It can be so, so weird there.	Ate ŋu anye nusi wɔ nuku ale gbegbe, ale gbegbe le afima.
Not in this room.	Menye xɔ sia me o.
It will take a good day’s work out of it.	Axɔ ŋkeke ƒe dɔ nyui aɖe le eme.
He couldn’t stop it.	Mete ŋu tɔ te o.
You can’t do this stuff.	Màte ŋu awɔ nu sia o.
I just don’t understand it.	Ðeko nyemese egɔme o.
It might have been better for you.	Ðewohĩ anyo na wò hafi.
His face became serious.	Eƒe mo va nɔ vevie dom nu.
That’s what this is really about.	Emae nye nusi ŋu nya sia ku ɖo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Here there was only one.	Le afisia la, ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
I got the job once.	Mexɔ dɔa zi ɖeka.
This will not be easy.	Esia manɔ bɔbɔe o.
But few have been able to achieve this.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe te ŋu ɖo esia gbɔ.
People treated us well.	Amewo wɔ nu ɖe ​​mía ŋu nyuie.
I am so worried about you.	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò ale gbegbe.
We couldn’t have done this without him.	Míate ŋu awɔ esia eya manɔmee o.
Still, take your time.	Ke hã, tsɔ wò ɣeyiɣi.
We can’t do that.	Míate ŋu awɔ ema o.
It used to be real.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ tsã.
I did something right.	Mewɔ nane nyuie.
We couldn’t do this without you.	Míate ŋu awɔ esia wò manɔmee o.
This thread can be very very long.	Ka sia ate ŋu anye didi ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
He could not have taken care of himself.	Mate ŋu akpɔ eɖokui dzi hafi o.
I can’t find them anywhere.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wo le afi aɖeke o.
Finding the truth is very very difficult.	Nyateƒea didi sesẽ ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t answer.	Mete ŋu ɖo eŋu o.
No one believed him.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ edzi se o.
He couldn’t see anything wrong.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
Everyone wants to work with you.	Ame sia ame adi be yeawɔ dɔ kpli wò.
It was a huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖee wònye.
Therefore,	Eya ta,
I was bone tired.	Medo ƒu ɖeɖi te ŋunye.
That was four years ago.	Ema nye ƒe ene enye sia.
He is at work in your life at this very moment.	Ele dɔ wɔm le wò agbe me le ɣeyiɣi sia tututu me.
Everyone has tried.	Amesiame dze agbagba kpɔ.
That didn’t please him at all.	Ema medze eŋu kura o.
You can still do this.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia kokoko.
It felt like just one person.	Ewɔ nam abe ame ɖeka koe ene.
Now we have to work.	Fifia ele be míawɔ dɔ.
Same old voice, same old lie.	Gbe xoxo ma ke, alakpa xoxo ma ke.
I have never felt so small.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be nyemele sue nenema gbegbe o.
This is a new phenomenon.	Esia nye nu yeye aɖe.
In this case, it didn’t.	Le go sia me la, mewɔe nenema o.
I don’t know how to help her.	Nyemenya ale si mawɔ akpe ɖe eŋu o.
In his throat.	Le eƒe kɔ me.
You’re not going to get a better deal.	Mèle nu si nyo wu la xɔ ge o.
He always had a good word for everyone.	Nya nyui aɖe nɔa esi na amesiame ɣesiaɣi.
Which makes no sense.	Nusi me susu aɖeke mele o.
He didn’t expect one that would actually work.	Mekpɔ mɔ na esi awɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He wouldn’t let go.	Maɖe asi le eŋu o.
And another chapter.	Eye ta bubu hã.
I couldn’t be happier.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ wu ema o.
I could play anything.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nusianu.
This is very passionate for me.	Esia nye didi vevie nam ŋutɔ.
Yet, this can be very beneficial.	Ke hã esia ate ŋu aɖe vi na mí ŋutɔ.
I knew it was the only thing that made sense.	Menya be eya koe nye nu si me susu le.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But it’s not there.	Gake mele afima o.
It’s just impossible.	Ðeko wònye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o.
There was something odd about the room.	Nane si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ nɔ xɔa ŋu.
That’s very interesting.	Ema doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
I don’t know anything about it.	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o.
Which means that.	Nusi fia be.
It can be a bad thing.	Ate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ.
In fact, he never would.	Le nyateƒe me la, mawɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
No one has ever done it.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe kpɔ o.
I gave him a piece of my mind.	Metsɔ nye susu ƒe akpa aɖe nɛ.
But it may take some time.	Gake ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
To someone, anyone.	Na ame aɖe, amesiame.
This means that	Esia fia be .
None of them were on his side.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ eƒe akpa dzi o.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
I had no problem with that.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ ŋunye le nya ma ŋu o.
Because no one did anything about them.	Esi ame aɖeke mewɔ naneke ɖe wo ŋu o tae.
I just focused on them.	Ðeko metsɔ susu ɖo wo ŋu.
This is complicated and this is complicated.	Esia sesẽ eye esia nye nusi me kɔ.
That’s great, if a little weird about them.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ, nenye be ewɔ nuku vie le wo ŋu.
Each knows his job.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe nya eƒe dɔ.
Some clothes last a long time.	Awu aɖewo nɔa anyi didi.
It has everything in it.	Nusianu le eme le eme.
What is going on here? 	Nukae le edzi yim le afisia?
If anything, it’s the opposite.	Ne nane li la, ke esia to vovo na ema.
It was private, but it happened last year.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ, gake edzɔ le ƒe si va yi me.
I can’t do anything good.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu nyui aɖeke o.
The complainant fled from the police.	Ame si tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu la si le kpovitɔwo nu.
He has too much to do.	Nu geɖe akpa le esi wòawɔ.
He was alone, as much as one could be.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi, abe alesi ame ate ŋu anɔ ene.
I just wanted to stay home.	Ðeko medi be manɔ aƒeme.
You are on your way now.	Èle mɔ dzi fifia.
Also one of them is a dog.	Azɔ hã wo dometɔ ɖekae nye avu.
It doesn’t matter who lived and who died.	Ame si nɔ agbe kple ame si ku la mehiã o.
In this case, it is a good thing.	Le go sia me la, enye nu nyui aɖe.
Few people know about it.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nya nu tso eŋu.
You told him the truth.	Ègblɔ nyateƒea nɛ.
The car appeared to be damaged.	Edze abe ʋua gblẽ ene.
He’s committed to it now.	Etsɔ eɖokui na ɖe eŋu fifia.
Not a long time ago.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia o.
I wanted the word "dog".	Medi nya "avu" la.
He filed a complaint against her.	Etsɔ nya ɖe eŋu.
He had no job.	Dɔ aɖeke menɔ esi o.
I worked on it.	Mewɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
Probably best to do one thing at a time.	Ðewohĩ anyo wu be nàwɔ nu ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
There is no ship.	Meli o.
Now get out of my car.	Azɔ do le nye ʋu me.
Since the .	Esi wònye be .
His tongue dominated.	Eƒe aɖe xɔ aƒe ɖe eme.
That’s what he didn’t realize.	Emae nye nusi mekpɔ dze sii o.
You have two of them.	Eve le asiwò.
And for a good reason.	Eye susu nyui aɖe tae.
He has a simple job.	Dɔ bɔbɔe aɖe le esi.
But this doesn’t matter.	Gake esia mele vevie o.
But they had a good day.	Gake ŋkeke nyui aɖe nɔ wo si.
I'm pretty sure he's not ready for this.	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ be mele klalo na esia o.
Thank you so much for that.	Akpe geɖe na mi ɖe ema ta.
But not everyone can do that.	Gake ame sia ame mate ŋu awɔ ema o.
You can program this thing to do things.	Àte ŋu awɔ ɖoɖo ɖe nu sia ŋu be wòawɔ nuwo.
But it can get you anything you want in food.	Gake ate ŋu axɔ nusianu si nèdi la na wò le nuɖuɖu me.
I have to say this.	Ele nam be magblɔ nya sia.
This helped, but not for long.	Esia kpe ɖe eŋu, gake menye eteƒe didi o.
This road is very crowded.	Mɔ sia dzi amewo sɔ gbɔ ɖo ŋutɔ.
The point is simple.	Nya la le bɔbɔe.
He liked that about her.	Ema dzɔ dzi nɛ le eŋu.
I don’t understand this.	Nyemese nya sia gɔme o.
You can do two things.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu eve.
But he was getting quite angry.	Gake eya ya va nɔ dziku dom kura.
None of them were here, of course.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ afisia ya o.
There must have been a mistake.	Vodada aɖe anya nɔ anyi.
There is something big that he is not thinking about.	Nu gã aɖe li si ŋu eƒe susu mele o.
The first of many who were there.	Gbãtɔ si ame geɖe siwo nɔ afi ma kpɔ.
In real life.	Le agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ me.
The winter wind blew his face.	Dzomeŋɔli ya ƒo eƒe mo.
And that went on too long.	Eye ema yi edzi ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
I did it.	Mewɔe.
And yet, it was that, too.	Eye ke hã, enye ema, hã.
And ask what you want.	Eye bia nusi nèdi.
There is some truth in these words.	Nyateƒe aɖe le nya siawo me.
And his death was a mistake.	Eye eƒe ku nye vodada.
He is the perfect match for you.	Enye amesi sɔ nyuie na wò.
With the police.	Le kpovitɔwo gbɔ.
That’s one of his things.	Ema nye eƒe nuwo dometɔ ɖeka.
I'm in it.	Mele eme.
He didn’t understand.	Mese egɔme o.
From the first they ever have, to the last.	Tso gbãtɔ si le wo si kpɔ dzi, vaseɖe mamlɛtɔ dzi.
He didn’t ask any questions.	Mebia nya aɖeke o.
It’s just a thought.	Susu aɖe koe wònye.
There has to be a reason for what they are doing.	Ele be susu aɖe nanɔ nusi wɔm wole ta.
This could be better.	Esia ate ŋu anyo wu.
This has happened before.	Edzɔ alea kpɔ.
We can do this together.	Míate ŋu awɔ esia ɖekae.
The king rode away.	Fia la do sɔ dzo.
We had a little bit of that.	Nu sue aɖe nɔ mía si le ema ŋu.
They’re just like everyone else.	Wole abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
I promised myself this.	Medo esia ƒe ŋugbe na ɖokuinye.
He played a big role in this last night.	Ewɔ akpa gã aɖe le esia ŋu le zã si va yi me.
This is close to it.	Esia te ɖe eŋu.
I offered my hand in return.	Metsɔ nye asi na ɖe eteƒe.
The damage knocked the wind out of me, blew me away.	Nusi gblẽ le eŋu la do ya le menye, ƒo ya nam.
And here I am now.	Eye nyee nye esi fifia.
A man who spent his life for a cause.	Ŋutsu aɖe si zã eƒe agbe ɖe susu aɖe ta.
It was too impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi akpa.
You can’t always be in one place.	Màte ŋu anɔ teƒe aɖeke ɣesiaɣi o.
This is important to him.	Esia le vevie nɛ.
Tomorrow is breakfast day.	Etsɔ nye ŋdi nuɖuɖu ŋkeke.
It almost worked.	Ewɔ dɔ kloe.
It may be that way.	Ate ŋu anye nenema.
We have children the same age.	Vi siwo xɔ ƒe ɖeka le mía si.
I never had anyone to talk to.	Ame aɖeke menɔ asinye maƒo nu kplii kpɔ o.
I can’t be in a hurry.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ kaba o.
It's just as simple as that.	Ðeko wòle bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
This has happened before.	Esia dzɔ do ŋgɔ.
If it is under there.	Ne ele afima te la.
Some are doing really well.	Ame aɖewo le edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
So was he, too.	Eya hã nɔ nenema.
There is someone who must have seen something.	Ame aɖe li si anya kpɔ nane.
I have encountered that before.	Medo go ema do ŋgɔ.
Once you get involved.	Ne ènya ƒo eɖokui ɖe eme ko la.
It’s been a long year.	Ƒe didi aɖee nye esia.
It was a beautiful afternoon.	Ŋdɔ nyui aɖee wònye.
Everyone will know your name.	Ame sia ame anya wò ŋkɔ.
While these men lived, they prospered.	Esi ŋutsu siawo nɔ agbe la, nu dze edzi na wo.
Only a fraction of that is eligible.	Ema ƒe akpa sue aɖe koe dze.
Or in an adjacent position.	Alo le nɔnɔme si te ɖe eŋu me.
A place where there is a large rock.	Teƒe si kpe gã aɖe le.
He, for one person.	Eya, na ame ɖeka.
I know what happened.	Menya nusi dzɔ.
There are very few issues with it.	Nya ʋɛ aɖewo koe le eŋu.
We are creating a new reality.	Míele nu ŋutɔŋutɔ yeye aɖe wɔm.
One foot is enough.	Afɔ ɖeka sɔ gbɔ.
People couldn’t get into the project.	Amewo mete ŋu ge ɖe dɔa me o.
Check them out now.	Kpɔ wo ɖa azɔ.
It looks very good.	Edze nyuie ŋutɔ.
They don’t make sense.	Susu mele wo me o.
But there are two serious problems here.	Gake kuxi sesẽ eve aɖewo le afisia.
He wasn’t happy about it.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu o.
I couldn’t go on.	Nyemete ŋu yi edzi o.
People who look up to you, who accept you.	Ame siwo doa ŋku ɖe ŋuwò, siwo xɔa wò.
The issue will stand.	Nya la anɔ te.
No one can work harder.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ dɔ sesĩe wu ema o.
But few people are that interested.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe tsɔ ɖe le eme nenema gbegbe.
I'm ready.	Mele klalo.
Some people laughed.	Ame aɖewo ko nu.
That was a while ago.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye ema.
I will tell you this.	Magblɔ nya sia na wò.
He couldn't fight that many.	Mete ŋu wɔ avu kple ame geɖe nenema gbegbe o.
That’s great, thank you.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ, akpe na wò.
That you are here to stay.	Be èle afisia be yeanɔ anyi.
He wasn't calling them often enough.	Menye ɖe wònɔ ka ƒom na wo zi geɖe alesi dze o.
In that room.	Le xɔ ma me.
That can’t be the case.	Ema mate ŋu anye nenema o.
I know how many months have passed.	Menya ɣleti nenie va yi.
Things were going very well.	Nuwo nɔ edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔ.
Very simple actually.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ le nyateƒe me.
That didn’t surprise him.	Ema mewɔ nuku nɛ o.
How is it in these places?.	Aleke wòle le teƒe siawo?.
If you don’t have one, do it.	Ne ɖeke mele asiwò o la, ke wɔe.
That went too far.	Ema yi ŋgɔ akpa.
But it wasn’t working.	Gake menɔ dɔ wɔm o.
Spring will soon arrive.	Dzomeŋɔli ava ɖo kpuie.
He tried to imagine what they were doing.	Edze agbagba be yeakpɔ nu si wɔm wole la le susu me.
It will be easier this way.	Anɔ bɔbɔe wu le mɔ sia nu.
He wasn’t alone.	Menye ɖe wònɔ eɖokui si o.
Maybe, if all goes well.	Ðewohĩ, ne nuwo yi edzi nyuie.
Money has changed hands, over and over again.	Ga trɔ asi le eŋu, zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
A few people stayed behind.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo tsi anyi.
What do you think of this book?	Nukae nèsusu tso agbalẽ sia ŋu?
But he didn’t want this.	Gake medi esia o.
Two wishes came true.	Didi eve va eme.
We also know who did it.	Míenya amesi wɔe hã.
It’s very clear.	Eme kɔ ŋutɔ.
Summer is right around the corner.	Dzomeŋɔli tu aƒe tututu.
Something needs to be done about that.	Ele be woawɔ nane tso ema ŋu.
I want to bleed.	Medi be maɖe ʋu.
Someone with a mind like his own.	Ame aɖe si ƒe susu le abe eya ŋutɔ tɔ ene.
This road is very old.	Mɔ sia do xoxo ŋutɔ.
I explained that to you.	Meɖe nya ma me na wò.
This is not a big deal.	Esia menye nya gã aɖeke o.
I don’t need to tell you what happened.	Mehiã be magblɔ nusi dzɔ la na wò o.
That was a big deal for me.	Ema nye nu gã aɖe nam.
Maybe that’s me.	Ðewohĩ nyee nye ema.
I would love it actually.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ le nyateƒe me.
But everything went very well.	Gake nusianu yi edzi nyuie ŋutɔ.
Or himself.	Alo eya ŋutɔ.
But in this case, he can.	Gake le esia me la, ate ŋui.
Here, come inside.	Le afisia la, va ge ɖe eme.
I'll expect you there.	Makpɔ mɔ na wò le afima.
Can’t travel without one.	Mate ŋu azɔ mɔ ɖeka manɔmee o.
He had never had anything like this before.	Naneke si le abe esia ene menɔ esi kpɔ o.
You can’t, and for good reason.	Màte ŋui o, eye susu nyui aɖe tae.
This project is a long-term project.	Dɔ sia nye nusi woawɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
I actually came across this before.	Le nyateƒe me la, meva ke ɖe esia ŋu do ŋgɔ.
Another great point.	Nya gã bubu.
He wasn’t sure.	Meka ɖe edzi o.
That would be easy.	Ema anɔ bɔbɔe.
You can have whatever you want.	Nusianu si nèdi la ate ŋu anɔ asiwò.
Neither of them had ever been so happy.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mekpɔ dzidzɔ nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
They live in a small town.	Wole du sue aɖe me.
I am here now.	Mele afisia fifia.
But maybe it is the same.	Gake ɖewohĩ ele nenema ke.
So far, there have been plenty of surprises.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nu geɖe li siwo wɔ nuku.
This works now.	Esia wɔa dɔ fifia.
The desire to make money.	Didi be yeakpɔ ga.
There were four of them.	Wo dometɔ ene nɔ anyi.
We can’t live together.	Míate ŋu anɔ anyi ɖekae o.
This isn’t surprising.	Esia mewɔ nuku o.
I sincerely hope this is true.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be esia nye nyateƒe.
That’s a good thing.	Ema nye nu nyui aɖe.
What city is this?	Du kae nye esia?
This has caused some outrage.	Esia wɔe be ame aɖewo do dziku.
Otherwise, he would have killed himself.	Ne menye nenema o la, anye ne awu eɖokui.
This is nothing new either.	Esia hã menye nu yeye o.
I am not alone at all.	Menye nye ɖeka kura o.
I came out here so much.	Medo go le afisia ale gbegbe.
Everything is new.	Nusianu nye nu yeye.
I have nothing against them.	Naneke mele asinye ɖe wo ŋu o.
I just want to deal with this.	Ðeko medi be makpɔ esia gbɔ.
He might as well do this well.	Ðewohĩ awɔ esia nyuie hã.
There is a small town nearby.	Du sue aɖe te ɖe afima ŋu.
I had to report this to the police.	Ele be magblɔ nya sia na kpovitɔwo.
What do you think we should do?.	Nukae nèsusu be ele be míawɔ?.
Or it may be on them.	Alo ate ŋu anɔ wo dzi.
He couldn’t do anything.	Mete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
Focus on the food you are eating.	Tsɔ wò susu katã ɖo nuɖuɖu si ɖum nèle la ŋu.
The voice, but not the face.	Gbe la, gake menye mo la o.
He is the man of tomorrow.	Enye etsɔ ƒe ame.
I have that, too.	Ema hã le asinye.
Who died and who did it.	Ame si ku kple ame si wɔe.
This was one time when nothing he did could have helped.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi ɖeka si me naneke si wòwɔ mate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu o.
Yet they had a little time.	Ke hã ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe nɔ wo si.
There are very few people there.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe le afi ma.
After much trouble, of course.	Le kuxi geɖe megbe ya.
Few people own a car.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe si ʋu le.
It didn’t really work for me.	Mewɔ dɔ nam tututu o.
I was furious.	Medo dziku vevie.
And this is even more important.	Eye esia le vevie wu.
Two days later, he still hadn’t heard back.	Le ŋkeke eve megbe la, mese nya aɖeke tso eŋu haɖe o.
I want one too.	Nye hã medi ɖeka.
This thought has taken root in my mind.	Susu sia ƒo ke ɖe to ɖe nye susu me.
I have a mistake.	Vodada aɖe le ŋunye.
With everything you have.	Kple nusianu si le asiwò.
Someone who will take care of me.	Ame aɖe si akpɔ dzinye.
What year is this year?	Ƒe kae nye ƒe sia?
Let me know what times are good for you.	Na manya ɣeyiɣi siwo nyo na wò.
We must hurry now.	Ele be míawɔ kaba fifia.
I know people there.	Menya amewo le afima.
Years later still.	Le ƒe aɖewo megbe kokoko.
Say whatever you want to whomever you want.	Gblɔ nya sia nya si nèdi na amesiame si nèdi.
It could be tomorrow.	Ate ŋu anye etsɔ.
A strong man with a fine beard.	Ŋutsu sesẽ aɖe si ƒe ɖa le nyuie.
Keep up the good work!	Yi dɔ nyui la dzi!
And he, as now, ran away.	Eye eya hã, abe fifia ene la, si dzo.
I have to take care of myself .	Ele be makpɔ ɖokuinye dzi .
He did something so wrong.	Ewɔ nu gbegblẽ ale gbegbe.
I used to do it that way.	Tsã la, mewɔa esia nenema.
He started again.	Edze egɔme ake.
He had a bad temper.	Dziku gbegblẽ aɖe nɔ eŋu.
And he was angry, too.	Eye eya hã do dziku.
I do that quite often, actually.	Mewɔa ema zi geɖe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
And it’s a real thing.	Eye wònye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Please apologize in advance.	Ðe kuku do ŋgɔ.
And many of them, too.	Eye wo dometɔ geɖe hã.
I would love to do it.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔe.
Can you lend me some money?	Àte ŋu ado ga aɖe nam?
In many cases, you have to do the work.	Le go geɖe me la, ele be nàwɔ dɔa.
In contrast, there was nothing.	To vovo na ema la, naneke menɔ anyi o.
No one knows where he is.	Ame aɖeke menya afi si wòle o.
Share them with each other.	Ma wo na wo nɔewo.
It’s not part of the story here.	Menye nya la ƒe akpa aɖee wònye le afisia o.
He is watching us.	Ele mía kpɔm.
It doesn’t do anything.	Mewɔa naneke o.
Not here, not now.	Menye afisia o, menye fifia o.
I am not so sure now.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe fifia o.
It is a characteristic.	Enye nɔnɔme aɖe.
It was as if he did not exist.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe meli o ene.
Or how many people hit me.	Alo ame nenie ƒom.
We are going to miss them.	Míele wo to ge.
Change a child’s mind a little at a time.	Trɔ ɖevi ƒe susu vie le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
There were no problems with the project.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ dɔa ŋu o.
Any help would be great of course.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe anyo ŋutɔ ya.
It is a difficult problem.	Enye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
Help him with this project.	Kpe ɖe eŋu le dɔ sia wɔwɔ me.
He will go in his own time.	Ayi le eya ŋutɔ ƒe ɣeyiɣi me.
But this time there was none.	Gake fifia ya, ɖeke menɔ anyi o.
This morning, in fact.	Ŋdi sia, le nyateƒe me.
He couldn’t find it.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
He never got angry.	Medo dziku gbeɖe o.
It’s not enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
I glanced at him.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe eŋu.
People are collecting.	Amewo le nu ƒom ƒu.
It didn’t feel weird.	Mese le eɖokui me be ewɔ nuku o.
Hardly anyone knew where he was.	Ame aɖeke kura menya afisi wònɔ o.
He needed something small.	Ehiã nane sue aɖe.
This is going to work.	Esia le dɔ wɔ ge.
The few missing teeth are insignificant.	Aɖu ʋɛ siwo bu la mele vevie o.
But he saw nothing of this.	Gake mekpɔ naneke le esia ŋu o.
I work hard.	Mewɔa dɔ sesĩe.
He won’t talk to us.	Maƒo nu na mí o.
This will be true for many, of course.	Esia anye nyateƒe na ame geɖe ya.
It can be for you, too.	Ate ŋu anye na wò hã.
I had quite a few of them.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ nɔ asinye.
Still, he had some good skills.	Ke hã, aɖaŋu nyui aɖewo nɔ esi.
And he stopped eating too.	Eye eya hã dzudzɔ nuɖuɖu.
And it can be that way.	Eye ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
Yet they have everything.	Ke hã nusianu le wo si.
But he would never do it.	Gake mawɔe gbeɖe o.
Nor does he respond to my voice.	Eye mewɔa nu ɖe ​​nye gbe ŋu hã o.
Most of the time you don’t have to do anything.	Zi geɖe la, mehiã be nàwɔ naneke o.
None of them worked well.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ dɔ nyuie o.
None of them did it.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe o.
The truth is a little more interesting.	Nyateƒea doa dzidzɔ na ame wu vie.
Whoever said this is more than enough.	Ame sia ame si gblɔ nya sia la sɔ gbɔ wu.
We are only in the first phase at this point.	Akpa gbãtɔ me koe míele le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
That’s you, right?	Wòe nye ema, alo?
This can be a great thing.	Esia ate ŋu anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Hours and hours.	Gaƒoƒo kple gaƒoƒo geɖe.
I had the exact same issue.	Nya ma ke tututu nɔ asinye.
They have to work.	Ele be woawɔ dɔ.
I just can’t get my hands on it.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu akpɔ asi le eŋu o.
That's about .	Ema ku ɖe .
He needed something more.	Ehiã nane si sɔ gbɔ wu.
This holds up rather well.	Esia lé ɖe te nyuie vie.
This is not the same.	Esia mele ɖeka o.
But other than that.	Gake ne menye nenema o la.
The man who gathered.	Ŋutsu si ƒo ƒu la.
Anything but, really.	Nusianu gake, le nyateƒe me la.
I’m so glad you could come.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be àte ŋu ava.
I am fine now.	Mele nyuie fifia.
I’ve never seen that before.	Nyemekpɔ nu ma kpɔ o.
This is not true.	Esia menye nyateƒe o.
Or it could be a place.	Alo ate ŋu anye teƒe aɖe.
This isn’t me.	Menye nyee nye esia o.
Yet, his mind was troubled.	Ke hã eƒe susu nɔ fu ɖem nɛ.
I'm here, man.	Mele afisia, ŋutsu.
I can be nice to her now.	Mate ŋu anye ame nyui nɛ fifia.
What it is now.	Nusi wònye fifia.
Not for us, anyway.	Menye na mí o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
He is doing well now without you.	Ele edzi dzem fifia wò manɔmee.
I can’t live like this.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe alea o.
Another part of his life.	Eƒe agbe ƒe akpa bubu.
It’s the most exciting thing ever.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame wu ɖesiaɖe kpɔ.
I can help him with that.	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu le ema me.
He wasn’t controlling himself.	Menye ɖe wònɔ eɖokui dzi ɖum o.
But of course it didn’t.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
You know what.	Ènya nusi.
Also, it’s very simple.	Azɔ hã, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
But he was never late.	Gake metsi megbe gbeɖe o.
He didn’t get what he expected.	Mekpɔ nusi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na o.
My treat to join you today.	Nye nuɖuɖu be mawɔ ɖeka kpli mi egbea.
Hear that.	Se nya ma.
I am a good guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖee menye.
You said watch out for them.	Ègblɔ be kpɔ nyuie le wo ŋu.
I got his money.	Mexɔ eƒe ga.
But there was one big problem with this.	Gake kuxi gã ɖeka aɖe nɔ esia ŋu.
The apartment is very small.	Xɔa me le sue ŋutɔ.
The teacher is in a bad mood today.	Nufiala la ƒe nɔnɔme gblẽ egbea.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
In the past year.	Le ƒe si va yi me.
Many were already on their way.	Ame geɖe nɔ mɔ dzi xoxo.
It’s a part of life.	Enye agbe ƒe akpa aɖe.
But people don’t seem to do that.	Gake edze abe amewo mewɔa nu ma o ene.
But it could be that way.	Gake ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
Everyone is equal.	Ame sia ame sɔ.
If this happens, be careful.	Ne esia dzɔ la, kpɔ nyuie.
And your voice, too.	Eye wò gbe hã.
That much is certainly obvious.	Nu ma gbegbe dze ƒã godoo.
Nothing is against it.	Naneke metsi tre ɖe eŋu o.
But keep an eye on things.	Gake lé ŋku ɖe nu ŋu.
It was a great job.	Dɔ gã aɖee wònye.
I have done this over and over again.	Mewɔ esia zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
It’s just the car.	Ʋua koe.
I was able to hold myself together.	Mete ŋu lé ɖokuinye ɖe te.
And I introduced myself.	Eye meɖe ɖokuinye fia.
Usually.	Zi geɖe.
He has lost his character.	Eƒe nɔnɔme megale eŋu o.
I could know that much.	Mete ŋu nya nu geɖe ma.
About an hour ago.	Anɔ abe gaƒoƒo ɖeka ene enye sia.
I have you in my hands.	Wòe le asinye.
A problem arose.	Kuxi aɖe do mo ɖa.
He didn’t stand for anything.	Metsi tre ɖe naneke ŋu o.
Which is what he will do.	Nusi nye nusi wòawɔ.
They had four children.	Vi ene nɔ wo si.
And he did that very well.	Eye ewɔ ema nyuie ŋutɔ.
It’s just that way.	Ðeko wòle nenema.
He did a lot of things.	Ewɔ nu geɖe.
He was just tired.	Ðeko ɖeɖi te eŋu.
Work was busy and my personal life was cheap.	Vovo menɔ dɔ ŋu o eye nye ŋutɔ nye agbe hã mexɔ asi o.
I know you’re working, though.	Menya be èle dɔ wɔm, gake.
I want to speak out against it.	Medi be maƒo nu tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
I just wanted to say.	Ðeko medi be magblɔ be.
Like a string, there is no string.	Abe ka ene la, ka aɖeke meli o.
There were two men there.	Ŋutsu eve nɔ afima.
But somehow he escaped.	Gake le mɔ aɖe nu la, esi.
He seemed to have something on his mind.	Edze abe nane nɔ susu me nɛ ene.
I think a lot of people.	Mesusu be ame geɖe.
That was someone else.	Ame bubu aɖee nye ema.
He won’t do that.	Mawɔe nenema o.
I was the first to see this.	Nyee nye ame gbãtɔ si kpɔ esia.
I can’t drive a car.	Nyemete ŋu ʋua ʋu o.
My kind, or his kind.	Nye ƒomevi, alo eƒe ƒomevi.
Just look ahead	Kpɔ ŋgɔ ko
Or anywhere, at this point in his life.	Alo le afi sia afi, le eƒe agbe ƒe akpa sia.
I need to deal with this first thing tomorrow.	Ehiã be makpɔ nu gbãtɔ sia gbɔ etsɔ.
So many things are different.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ to vovo.
We have to act together.	Ele be míawɔ nu ɖekae.
It’s not big or small.	Menye gã alo sue o.
You can stay there tonight.	Àte ŋu anɔ afima le zã sia me.
He couldn’t think of it.	Mete ŋu bu eŋu o.
There is water in it.	Tsi le eme.
Just like you are.	Abe alesi nèle ene.
I can’t do anything else.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
It’s a no-brainer.	Enye nusi me susu mele o.
I am trying to do better.	Mele agbagba dzem be mawɔe nyuie wu.
I had an attitude.	Nɔnɔme aɖe nɔ ŋunye.
Everything will never be the same.	Nusianu manɔ abe tsã ene gbeɖe o.
He wasn’t going to get any help.	Menɔ kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke xɔ ge o.
I remember it very well.	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie ŋutɔ.
Get some rest on the go.	Gbɔ ɖe eme vie ne èle mɔ dzi.
Couldn't achieve anything from here, anyway.	Mete ŋu ɖo naneke gbɔ tso afisia o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
It didn’t exist.	Menɔ anyi o.
This is true, very true.	Esia nye nyateƒe, nyateƒe ŋutɔ.
It had been his home for a long time.	Enye eƒe aƒe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
This guy was right behind her.	Ŋutsu sia nɔ megbe nɛ tututu.
However, he didn’t respond.	Ke hã, meɖo eŋu o.
The meeting was brief.	Kpekpea nɔ kpuie.
There were a good number of supporters.	Ame siwo kpe asi ɖe eŋu la sɔ gbɔ nyuie.
I felt like I was being operated on in my entire case.	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ɖe wole dɔ wɔm nam le nye nya bliboa me ene.
Do we have enough water?	Ðe tsi si sɔ gbɔ le mía sia?
I'll do it.	Mawɔe.
You are a great person.	Ame gã aɖee nènye.
I don’t know what to do about it.	Nyemenya nu si mawɔ tso eŋu o.
But it would be nice to have something as good.	Gake anyo be nane nanɔ asiwò abe nyui ene.
And another escaped for some reason.	Eye ame bubu hã si le susu aɖewo ta.
This is a really, really bad idea.	Esia nye susu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Not that I could take the job.	Menye ɖe mate ŋu axɔ dɔa o.
You are asking for more than more.	Èle nu geɖe biam wu nu geɖe wu.
His face was overwhelmed.	Eƒe mo xɔ aƒe ɖe eme.
Each of us felt it.	Mía dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe se le eɖokui me.
This is not surprising at all.	Esia mewɔ nuku kura o.
Now listen to the.	Azɔ ɖo to.
The hole's	Doa ƒe .
Nothing like that, ever.	Naneke meli nenema o, gbeɖe o.
This case is going to take two of us.	Nya sia le mía dometɔ eve xɔ ge.
We have no money for anything.	Ga aɖeke mele mía si ɖe naneke ta o.
Its been a while now.	Eƒe ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
That was the only thing that made sense.	Ema koe nye nu si me susu nɔ.
Say each word out loud several times.	Gblɔ nya ɖesiaɖe sesĩe zi geɖe.
Adjust it accordingly.	Trɔ asi le eŋu ɖe edzi.
What would you do there.	Nukae nàwɔ le afima.
It never occurred to me to remove anything.	Meva susu me nam kpɔ be maɖe naneke ɖa o.
He didn’t show up.	Meɖe eɖokui fia o.
He couldn’t do it.	Mete ŋu wɔe o.
Something that replaced something else.	Nane si xɔ ɖe nu bubu teƒe.
But it can be a long road.	Gake ate ŋu anye mɔ didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
I haven’t had any problems with it.	Nyemekpɔ kuxi aɖeke tso eme o.
These people are on to something else.	Ame siawo le nu bubu aɖe dzi.
I have to get this money out of here.	Ele nam be maɖe ga sia le afisia.
But with opportunity comes challenge.	Gake mɔnukpɔkpɔ hã kpe ɖe kuxi ŋu.
We now have our king.	Míaƒe fia le mía si fifia.
I can’t do anything for you.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke na wò o.
That would solve a lot of problems.	Ema akpɔ kuxi geɖe gbɔ.
This is just common sense.	Esia nye nusi me susu le ko.
Now we are seeing a different side of it.	Fifia míele eƒe akpa bubu aɖe kpɔm.
I knew there would be.	Menya be anɔ anyi.
There are two things.	Nu eve aɖewo li.
Two people survived.	Ame eve tsi agbe.
That seems a little strange.	Ema dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku vie ene.
That in itself is pretty amazing.	Ema ŋutɔ nye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Command it as you wish.	De se nɛ abe ale si nèdi ene.
The salty air.	Ya si me dze le la.
There was no denial.	Gbegbe aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
As if he would never let go.	Abe ɖe maɖe mɔ gbeɖe o ene.
You can do anything, there.	Àte ŋu awɔ nusianu, le afima.
I'll do something.	Mawɔ nu.
It was more than a surprise.	Menye nusi wɔ nuku koe wònye.
I can’t get rid of the gun fast enough.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe tu la ɖa kaba o.
The last person said this.	Ame mamlɛtɔ gblɔ nya sia.
I have to apologize for that.	Ele be maɖe kuku ɖe ema ta.
It’s not me.	Menye nyee o.
Everyone should keep this in mind.	Ele be esia nanɔ susu me na amesiame.
That didn’t work either.	Ema hã mewɔ dɔ o.
He may not do this.	Ðewohĩ mawɔ esia o.
Stand up for it.	Tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
Something is different about him.	Nane to vovo le eŋu.
In fact, there are two now.	Le nyateƒe me la, eve fifia.
And when the first one came out, everything changed.	Eye esi wo dometɔ gbãtɔ do la, nusianu trɔ.
Just think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ kokoko.
A good book is a good book.	Agbalẽ nyui nye agbalẽ nyui aɖe.
People can talk.	Amewo ate ŋu aƒo nu.
I'm sure it's something else.	Meka ɖe edzi be nu bubu aɖee.
He can’t come home.	Mate ŋu ava aƒeme o.
Some people didn’t.	Ame aɖewo mewɔe nenema o.
It was very pleasant to him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
Now that's good police work.	Fifia ema nye kpovitɔwo ƒe dɔ nyui aɖe.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
The engine of a car.	Ʋu ƒe mɔ̃.
It’s not just about any time.	Menye ɣeyiɣi aɖeke ko ŋu o.
This seems to be very important.	Edze abe esia le vevie ŋutɔ ene.
I did my part.	Mewɔ nye akpa dzi.
No one seemed surprised.	Edze abe mewɔ nuku na ame aɖeke o ene.
Everyone does that.	Amesiame wɔa nu ma.
Maybe someone will remember.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe aɖo ŋku edzi.
Thank you for this.	Akpe na wò ɖe esia ta.
It’s almost shocking.	Ewɔ nuku kloe.
He won’t do anything now.	Mawɔ naneke fifia o.
But he didn’t care.	Gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
This is definitely a must.	Esia nye nusi wòle be woawɔ godoo.
Which is more rooted in reality?.	Kae ƒo ke ɖe to ɖe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ me wu?.
It’s very important to me.	Ele vevie nam ŋutɔ.
And for that, he has my respect.	Eye le ema ta la, nye bubu le eŋu.
His mind is in order.	Eƒe susu le ɖoɖo nu.
And we know we are part of this.	Eye míenya be míenye esia ƒe akpa aɖe.
You are far from alone.	Menye wò ɖeka koe li kura o.
Not much of anything.	Menye nu geɖe o.
It’s one thing too many.	Enye nu ɖeka si sɔ gbɔ akpa.
He had never touched her.	Meka asi eŋu kpɔ o.
But it doesn’t matter.	Gake mehiã o.
It was my first novel.	Enye nye agbalẽ gbãtɔ.
Everything is so clear.	Nusianu me kɔ ale gbegbe.
It was a long, long day.	Enye ŋkeke didi aɖe si didi ŋutɔ.
I don’t know what it is.	Nyemenya nusi wònye o.
His hand was very small.	Eƒe asi nɔ sue ŋutɔ.
His voice was clear.	Eƒe gbe me kɔ.
It’s really original.	Eye wònye gbãtɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Now, you know better than to do that.	Fifia, ènya nyuie wu be nàwɔ ema.
It’s just a little bit.	Enye nu sue aɖe ko.
He had never heard anything.	Mese naneke kpɔ o.
The work became difficult.	Dɔa va sesẽ.
Police have lost his name.	Kpovitɔwo bu eƒe ŋkɔ.
Ema ava.	Ema ava.
Same time, same place, same price.	Ɣeyiɣi ɖeka ma ke, teƒe ɖeka ma ke, asi ɖeka ma ke.
And what there is, is the truth.	Eye nusi li la, enye nyateƒe la.
An atmosphere of anger prevails.	Dziku ƒe nɔnɔme aɖe xɔ aƒe ɖe amewo me.
And you will enjoy doing so.	Eye esia wɔwɔ adzɔ dzi na wò.
They will do everything for you.	Woawɔ nu sia nu na wò.
The night is over.	Zã la nu va yi.
Or a car.	Alo ʋu aɖe.
But, you may have missed something.	Gake, ɖewohĩ nane to ŋuwò.
He gave away where he was.	Etsɔ afisi wòle la na.

The dog suddenly disappeared.	Avu la bu zi ɖeka.
There will be so much to do.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ anɔ anyi woawɔ.
I had that in my hands.	Ema nɔ asinye.
In fact, I had to deal with the whole thing earlier.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele be mawɔ nu ɖe ​​nu bliboa ŋu do ŋgɔ wu.
What is this.	Nu kae nye esia.
And the whole thing.	Eye nu bliboa katã.
Give or take a few years.	Na alo xɔ ƒe ʋɛ aɖewo.
He seemed to be the only one enjoying himself.	Edze abe eya ɖeka koe nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm ene.
Thank you very much.	Akpe na mi ŋutɔ.
This already seems simple enough.	Esia dze abe ɖe wòle bɔbɔe xoxo ene.
I hope I can help.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
He was a little surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ vie.
It is true in a way.	Enye nyateƒe le mɔ aɖe nu.
I don’t want to do it either.	Nye hã nyemedi be mawɔe o.
I told him more than anyone else.	Megblɔ nu geɖe nɛ wu ame bubu ɖesiaɖe.
I just couldn’t face people.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu dze ŋgɔ amewo o.
Why not have them all?.	Nukatae wo katã manɔ asiwò o?.
However, this remains a major challenge.	Gake esia gakpɔtɔ nye kuxi gã aɖe.
His character was damaged.	Eƒe nɔnɔme gblẽ nu le eŋu.
I don’t think there’s anything we can do about it.	Nyemesusu be naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu o.
But it didn’t last long.	Gake menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
They’re all bothering him.	Wo katã wole fu ɖem nɛ.
It’s that simple.	Ele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe.
Work is going on in this direction.	Dɔ le edzi yim le mɔ sia nu.
Perhaps no one did.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
Your life is now.	Wò agbe nye fifia.
The last time, he couldn’t get through.	Zi mamlɛtɔ la, mete ŋu to eme o.
It may not be easy, but it is far from impossible.	Ðewohĩ manɔ bɔbɔe o, gake menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ kura o.
He didn’t know what the big deal was.	Menya nusi nye nya gã la o.
They are right here.	Wole afisia tututu.
It will stay that way, everyone said.	Anɔ anyi nenema, amesiame gblɔ.
It’s not easy, it really isn’t.	Mele bɔbɔe o, le nyateƒe me la, mele bɔbɔe o.
He is going home.	Ele aƒeme yim.
That’s a good idea.	Susu nyui aɖee nye ema.
He was very pleased with the result.	Nusi do tso eme la do dzidzɔ nɛ ŋutɔ.
His face is upon us.	Eƒe mo le mía ŋu.
From the one who doesn’t have it.	Tso amesi si mele o la gbɔ.
Each of them is there as a place on.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe le afima abe teƒe aɖe ene le.

You don’t have any money.	Ga aɖeke mele asiwò o.
He must have a good reason.	Ele be susu nyui aɖe nanɔ esi.
We know very little about them.	Míenya nu boo aɖeke tso wo ŋu o.

Last night.	Etsɔ zã me.
It is that easy for me.	Ele bɔbɔe nam nenema gbegbe.
Now his hand is in control.	Fifia eƒe asi le dzi ɖum.
It didn’t work that way.	Mewɔ dɔ nenema o.
In fact, he probably should have quite a few.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ ele be ame ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ nanɔ esi.
I wouldn’t have a car there.	Ʋu manɔ asinye le afima o.
This thread is too short.	Ka sia le kpuie akpa.
Few people know the truth yet.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nya nyateƒea haɖe.
He became very interested in his life.	Eƒe agbe va dzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I need a plan for next year.	Mehiã ɖoɖo aɖe na ƒe si gbɔna.
I can work hard.	Mete ŋu wɔa dɔ sesĩe.
He is a man of his word.	Enye ame si le eƒe nya nu.
They had two children.	Vi eve nɔ wo si.
I stepped outside.	Meɖe afɔ do go.
His role will be amazing.	Eƒe akpa si wòawɔ la awɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I hope it helps you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
Neither seems likely now.	Edze abe wo dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu adzɔ fifia o ene.
Life is short.	Agbe le kpuie.
I am the truth.	Nyee nye nyateƒe.
He’s very interested in her.	Eƒe nu doa dzidzɔ nɛ ŋutɔ.
I am treating you like a man.	Mele nu wɔm ɖe ŋuwò abe ŋutsu ene.
But one thing that .	Gake nu ɖeka aɖe si .
His face worked.	Eƒe mo wɔ dɔ.
Yet there was something unclear.	Ke hã nane nɔ anyi si me kɔ o.
That’s a very small thing.	Ema nye nu sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
In fact, he was very busy.	Le nyateƒe me la, vovo menɔ eŋu kura o.
I'm not sure any of them worked.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be wo dometɔ aɖeke wɔ dɔ o.
I will find a new place to live.	Makpɔ teƒe yeye aɖe si manɔ.
Have a good one.	Nyui aɖe nanɔ asiwò.
Which means he can fight.	Nusi fia be ate ŋu awɔ avu.
There will come a time when it can be helpful to have one.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe ava si me wòate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu be ɖeka nanɔ ame si.
Maybe he doesn’t know.	Ðewohĩ menya o.
Today, it doesn’t.	Egbea la, mewɔe nenema o.
Almost nothing will be the same.	Naneke kloe manɔ abe alesi wòle ene o.
But that doesn’t matter much.	Gake ema mehiã boo o.
There is room in my house for you.	Teƒe le nye aƒe me na wò.
I want to know more.	Medi be manya nu geɖe wu.
Tell me about that.	Gblɔ nya ma nam.
Time is money.	Ɣeyiɣi nye ga.
I think you know this.	Mesusu be ènya esia.
The apartment was simple.	Xɔa me nuwo nɔ bɔbɔe.
I never touched them.	Nyemeka asi wo ŋu kpɔ o.
He was some kind of person.	Enye ame aɖe si ƒomevi wònye.
It is the very nature of our mind.	Enye míaƒe susu ƒe nɔnɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
They are in the house.	Wole aƒea me.
I have them now.	Wo le asinye fifia.
But this didn’t bother me at all.	Gake esia meɖe fu nam kura o.
Anyone can beat anyone.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu aƒo ame sia ame.
He never asked for anything.	Mebia naneke gbeɖe o.
Think of your own case!	Bu wò ŋutɔ wò nya ŋu!
He couldn’t find it.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
It’s a really annoying problem.	Enye kuxi si doa dziku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I didn’t have any of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ asinye o.
Probably in any great book.	Ðewohĩ le agbalẽ gã ɖesiaɖe me.
It is a beautiful city.	Du nyui aɖee wònye.
There is no problem with this.	Kuxi aɖeke mele esia ŋu o.
Anything will work, really.	Nusianu awɔ dɔ, le nyateƒe me.
I felt very satisfied.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme ŋutɔ.
I’m not really like that .	Nyemele nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ o .
We are never going to head.	Míele ta yim gbeɖe o.
The teacher is good.	Nufiala la nyo.
The plaintiffs are wrong.	Ame siwo tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu la da ƒu.
I should have been happy.	Ðe wòle be makpɔ dzidzɔ hafi.
I saw the whole thing.	Mekpɔ nu bliboa.
Maybe it will go, maybe it won’t.	Ðewohĩ ayi, ɖewohĩ mayi o.
He doesn’t look happy.	Medze abe ɖe wòle dzidzɔ kpɔm ene o.
I became efficient.	Meva nɔ dɔ wɔm nyuie.
It was never like that.	Menye nenema gbeɖe o.
What should we do today?	Nu kae wòle be míawɔ egbea?
Actually, it’s old time.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye ɣeyiɣi xoxo aɖe.
I don’t understand that.	Nyemese nya ma gɔme o.
Perhaps we can	Ðewohĩ míate ŋui .
I saw your face.	Mekpɔ wò mo.
Everyone was devastated by what had happened.	Nu si dzɔ la te ɖe amesiame dzi ŋutɔ.
This was very exciting for me.	Esia do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
And that’s not all there is to it.	Eye menye ema koe nye ema o.
And it’s a tough one.	Eye enye nya sesẽ aɖe.
But that was not a possibility at that point.	Gake ema menye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma me o.
That’s a good idea.	Susu nyui aɖee nye ema.
That could have happened earlier.	Ema ate ŋu adzɔ do ŋgɔ hafi.
I saw how he was with her.	Mekpɔ alesi wòle kplii.
But only two have made new arrangements.	Gake eve koe wɔ ɖoɖo yeye.
This is a good thing.	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe.
I’m worried about you.	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò.
I don’t want to know.	Nyemedi be manya o.
Now you can see everything.	Fifia àte ŋu akpɔ nusianu.
I think it will be very useful for us.	Mesusu be aɖe vi na mí ŋutɔ.
I don’t want to be married.	Medi be madi nam o.
He didn’t have that.	Eya menɔ esi o.
All in one day works.	Wo katã le ŋkeke ɖeka me wɔa dɔ.
That’s money.	Ema nye ga.
This kind of surprised me.	Esia ƒomevi wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
It is like our heart.	Ele abe míaƒe dzi ene.
Yet every which way.	Ke hã mɔ ɖesiaɖe dzi.
And maybe he’d like it if things were different.	Eye ɖewohĩ adzɔ dzi nɛ ne nuwo to vovo.
I just met you.	Ðeko medo go wò teti koe nye ema.
It’s a part of my life.	Enye nye agbe ƒe akpa aɖe.

I'm not sure they have a name.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be ŋkɔ le wo si o.
That’s not what we have here.	Menye emae le mía si le afisia o.
Give me a hard time	Na ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe nam
Drive that tube of yours through my heart.	Ʋu wò mɔ̃ ma to nye dzi me.
He had a good life here.	Agbe nyui aɖe nɔ esi le afisia.
Is that weird?	Ema nye nusi mewɔ nuku oa?
Find a new way.	Di mɔ yeye aɖe.
I have one simple rule for this kind of work.	Se bɔbɔe ɖeka le asinye ku ɖe dɔ sia ƒomevi wɔwɔ ŋu.
In this case.	Le nɔnɔme sia me la.
His men got behind him.	Eƒe amewo ge ɖe megbe nɛ.
It may be, it may not be.	Ate ŋu anye, mate ŋu anye o.
It might be a great deal.	Ðewohĩ anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Where you live doesn’t matter.	Afisi nèle mele vevie o.
No one came to his aid.	Ame aɖeke meva kpe ɖe eŋu o.
It was very pleasant to him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
If only someone would listen.	Ne ɖe ame aɖe aɖo to ko.
Or in any case, really.	Alo le nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe me, le nyateƒe me.
I am looking for help.	Mele kpekpeɖeŋu dim.
He treated her as an equal.	Ewɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu abe ame si sɔ kplii ene.
Many times, many times.	Zi geɖe, zi geɖe.
That is impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
We have to work harder.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ sesĩe wu.
I don’t think I can.	Nyemesusu be mate ŋui o.
He had his man.	Eƒe ame nɔ esi.
And to comply with it.	Eye be wòawɔ ɖe edzi.
We can go anywhere.	Míate ŋu ayi afi sia afi.
However, it is not necessary.	Ke hã, mehiã o.
Summer is important.	Dzomeŋɔli le vevie.
Until this year.	Vaseɖe ƒe sia me.
No problem, really.	Kuxi aɖeke meli o, le nyateƒe me.
In fact, death.	Le nyateƒe me la, ku.
Few people do this.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔa esia.
Please, be careful.	Taflatse, kpɔ nyuie.
I can do that now.	Mate ŋu awɔ ema fifia.
Or some of them, of course.	Alo wo dometɔ aɖewo ya.
You can’t do it.	Màte ŋu awɔe o.
Do something new.	Wɔ nu yeye aɖe.
Everything is in the right place.	Nusianu le teƒe si sɔ.
I am the teacher.	Nyee nye nufiala la.
He didn’t know what was going to happen.	Menya nusi ava dzɔ o.
I couldn’t stand it.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
I'm still working on that.	Megale dɔ wɔm tso ema ŋu kokoko.
You know where he is.	Ènya afisi wòle.
I know that place.	Menya teƒe ma.
It is the truth.	Enye nyateƒea.
Not as it is now.	Menye abe alesi wòle fifia ene o.
Four people died last night.	Ame ene ku le zã si va yi me.
Often, over and over again.	Zi geɖe la, zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I'll see them.	Makpɔ wo.
He needed to have some work to do.	Ehiã be dɔ aɖewo nanɔ esi wòawɔ.
I'm going to mado.	Na mado go.
He said absolutely nothing at the meeting.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke kura le kpekpea me o.
It would be a very good idea.	Anye susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can do it.	Mate ŋu awɔe.
I don’t know where to go from here.	Nyemenya afi si mayi tso afisia o.
The wind hit the house.	Ya la dze aƒea dzi.
There just isn’t much there.	Ðeko nu geɖe mele afima o.
I do what my job requires.	Mewɔa nusi nye dɔa bia.
He was a happy and really nice person.	Enye ame si kpɔa dzidzɔ eye wònye ame nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It just can’t work.	Ðeko mate ŋu awɔ dɔ o.
To do what.	Be woawɔ nusi.
This time it worked.	Fifia ya ewɔ dɔ.
And he wanted more.	Eye eya hã di geɖe wu.
However, there is something about it.	Ke hã, nane le eme.
Use them as you please.	Zã wo alesi nèdi.
A good old thing.	Nu xoxo nyui aɖe.
Come, get up.	Va, tso.
One of you.	Wò dometɔ ɖeka.
In case this provides a contradiction.	Nenye be esia na nya aɖe si tsi tre ɖe eŋu la.
It’s not really complicated.	Menye nusi me kɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I want to see what people will do tomorrow.	Medi be makpɔ nusi amewo awɔ etsɔ.
Nothing, and never.	Naneke meli o, eye gbeɖe o.
He would like to go there.	Adi be yeayi afima.
But that was about him.	Gake nya ma ku ɖe eŋu.
But there is a way.	Gake mɔ aɖe li.
I just want to see them.	Ðeko medi be makpɔ wo.
I wonder what they like best.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae dzɔa dzi na wo wu hã.
One person will live.	Ame ɖeka anɔ agbe.
I am not that simple.	Nyemele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
They only belong to certain types of people.	Ame ƒomevi aɖewo koe nye wo tɔ.
He will live a normal life.	Anɔ agbe si sɔ.
Everyone’s life matters.	Ame sia ame ƒe agbe le vevie.
He fled the scene.	Esi dzo.
Those who don’t, don’t have the truth.	Ame siwo mewɔe o la, nyateƒea mele wo si o.
Take very good care of that book.	Lé be na agbalẽ ma nyuie ŋutɔ.
You can work from anywhere.	Àte ŋu awɔ dɔ tso afi sia afi.
At the same time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me.
I don’t understand why this has to be at all.	Nyemese nusita wòle be esia nanɔ la gɔme kura o.
However, this is a mistake.	Ke hã, esia nye vodada.
Or well, almost none.	Alo nyuie, ɖeke kloe meli o.
I just couldn’t stop.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu tɔ te o.
I will do anything for you.	Mawɔ nusianu na wò.
You know you’re excited.	Ènya be dzi dzɔ ye.
Everything in this room is wet.	Nusianu le xɔ sia me tsi.
And, look at me.	Eye, kpɔm ɖa.
We’re going to make everything work.	Míele ewɔ ge be nusianu nawɔ dɔ.
It must be close to its destination.	Ele be wòate ɖe afi si yim wòle ŋu.
But here you are.	Gake wòe nye esi.
I never quite knew what to expect.	Nyemenya nusi tututu makpɔ mɔ na gbeɖe o.
He didn’t want trouble, really.	Medi kuxi o, le nyateƒe me.
Go further than that again.	Yi ŋgɔ wu ema ake.
He didn’t, you know.	Mewɔe o, ènya.
In fact, this is not true at all.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
It might be nice if you could.	Ðewohĩ anyo ŋutɔ ne àte ŋui.
I knew he would say that too	Menya be eya hã agblɔ nya ma
I would have seen you.	Anye ne makpɔ wò.
I know something that can help me	Menya nane si ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye

There is a good reason for it.	Susu nyui aɖe li si tae.
I know the face very well	Menya mo la nyuie ŋutɔ
In fact, he was very pleased.	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I have to talk to you	Ele nam be maƒo nu kpli wò
He couldn’t remember anything.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku naneke dzi o.
In him, they are.	Le eya me la, wole.
I had to find out what, exactly, happened.	Ele nam be madi nusi, tututu, dzɔ.
This has now changed.	Esia trɔ fifia.
It doesn’t matter who he is.	Amekae wònye mehiã o.
He might come home every day.	Ðewohĩ ava aƒeme gbe sia gbe.
That shouldn’t be so surprising.	Mele be ema nawɔ nuku nenema gbegbe o.
But the atmosphere there is still great.	Gake nɔnɔme si le afima la gakpɔtɔ nyo ŋutɔ.
And it doesn’t matter.	Eye mehiã o.
I want to marry you, share my life with you	Medi be maɖe wò, ma nye agbe na wò
He will not see my face or hear my voice.	Makpɔ nye mo alo ase nye gbe o.
I think it’s too personal	Mesusu be enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa
I just couldn’t understand it	Ðeko nyemete ŋu se egɔme o
He wasn't going to do anything.	Menye ɖe wònɔ naneke wɔ ge o.

One month late.	Ɣleti ɖeka tsi megbe.
I fell off a small building	Medze anyi tso xɔ sue aɖe dzi
That's good now.	Ema nyo fifia.
I might as well live here as anywhere.	Ðewohĩ manɔ afisia abe afi sia afi ene.
But this is an old book.	Gake agbalẽ xoxo aɖee nye esia.

At least a few days, maybe more	Ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo ya teti, ɖewohĩ wu nenema
I will be alone.	Nye ɖeka manɔ anyi.
But I wanted to know about it	Gake medi be manya nu tso eŋu
I was so worried about it	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe
Maybe he was meeting someone.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖee wònɔ go dom.
I was more worried, than anything	Metsi dzi wu, wu nusianu
All in one shot.	Wo katã le tu ɖeka me.
I already felt so good	Mese le ɖokuinye me xoxo ale gbegbe
Maybe just a little bit.	Ðewohĩ vi aɖe koe.
But what happened was quite different.	Gake nusi dzɔ la to vovo kura.
That will work.	Ema awɔ dɔ.
Part of it is right.	Eƒe akpa aɖe tɔ dzɔ.
He didn’t want that life.	Medi be agbe ma nanɔ ye si o.
Something was definitely up.	Nane nɔ dzi yim godoo.
I promise, but you’re not going anywhere	Medo ŋugbe, gake mèle afi aɖeke yim o
He seems to have a mind of his own.	Edze abe susu aɖe le esi le eɖokui si ene.
I saw some things about it	Mekpɔ nu aɖewo le eŋu
I had to find something	Ele be makpɔ nane
Always make it about them.	Wɔe tso wo ŋu ɣesiaɣi.
It just is what it is.	Ðeko wònye nusi wònye.
Two pairs of pairs.	Eve eve ɖe eve.
You can go on with your life.	Àte ŋu ayi wò agbe dzi.

I just wish I knew that was all	Ðeko medi be manya be ema koe nye ema

Or about anything else for that matter.	Alo ku ɖe nu bubu ɖesiaɖe ŋu le nya ma ta.
This is not what you have.	Esia menye nusi le asiwò o.

His character is very important to me.	Eƒe nɔnɔme le vevie nam ŋutɔ.
I can’t get involved now	Nyemate ŋu aƒo ɖokuinye ɖe eme fifia o
It’s what we are.	Enye nusi míenye.
I didn’t see anything that surprised me	Nyemekpɔ naneke si wɔ nuku nam o
I don’t think that will happen though	Nyemesusu be adzɔ nenema o gake
Are they that way.	Ðe wole nenema.
All in one piece.	Wo katã le akpa ɖeka me.

He will not discourage them.	Maɖe dzi le wo ƒo o.
This is quite a lot.	Esia sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
I felt a little emotional, you know	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mese le ɖokuinye me vie, ènya
I can see that in his mind	Mete ŋu kpɔa ema le eƒe susu me
The men in our house didn’t think he would survive.	Ŋutsu siwo nɔ míaƒe aƒea me mesusu be anɔ agbe o.
I can never remember his name	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi gbeɖe o
That something is wrong.	Be nane gblẽ.
Many of us were like that	Mía dometɔ geɖe nɔ nenema
My voice is speaking.	Nye gbe le nu ƒom.
I will do that.	Mawɔe nenema.
But it is never working.	Gake mele dɔ wɔm gbeɖe o.
Almost everything was lost.	Nusianu kloe bu.
That is an issue in itself.	Nya aɖee nye ema le eɖokui si.
I wanted to know how he was dealing with everything	Medi be manya ale si wònɔ nu wɔm kple nusianu
I know that very well.	Menya nya ma nyuie.
I enjoyed that for many reasons.	Susu geɖe tae mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe ema ŋu.
In the same thing.	Le nu ma ke me.
I don’t know anything in this situation.	Nyemenya naneke le nɔnɔme sia me o.

A lot became easier in that place.	Nu geɖe va nɔ bɔbɔe le teƒe ma.
I wonder if they are doing that now.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe wole nu ma wɔm fifia hã.
He looked like he was going to get sick.	Edze abe ɖe wòle dɔ lé ge ene.

I am not sure yet.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi haɖe o.

I don’t want to know more	Nyemedi be manya nu geɖe wu o
I don’t want to see this	Nyemedi be makpɔ esia o
The apartment is relatively nice, if a bit small.	Xɔa me nyo vie, ne ele sue vie hã.

It was a great deal of fun	Enye dzidzɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ
But I still couldn’t find the gun	Gake nyemete ŋu kpɔ tu la haɖe o
He was the only one.	Eya ɖeka koe nye ema.
I couldn’t explain it in more detail	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eme kple nya siwo me kɔ wu ema o
And that’s not obvious.	Eye ema medze ƒã o.
That doesn’t matter.	Ema mehiã o.
I do this out loud.	Mewɔa esia sesĩe.
It's in one piece, more or less.	Ele akpa ɖeka me, wu alo wu nenema.
This is a good thing for me.	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe nam.

Two things are true.	Nu eve aɖewo nye nyateƒe.

Anything is possible.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.

Everything was left behind.	Nusianu gblẽ ɖi.
Stay in the house.	Nɔ aƒea me.
Maybe it will help you.	Ðewohĩ akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I planned for that	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ema ŋu
We don’t know what it is.	Míenya nusi wònye o.
Maybe next summer.	Ðewohĩ ava le dzomeŋɔli si gbɔna me.
Run away from his house.	Si le eƒe aƒeme.
Very few people have this kind of skill.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe si aɖaŋu sia ƒomevi le.
These two had that.	Ema nɔ ame eve siawo si.
Any help would be great.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe anyo ŋutɔ.

Not really, obviously.	Menye le nyateƒe me o, edze ƒã.
I realize where this is	Mekpɔ afisi esia le dze sii
I was almost certain he couldn’t	Meka ɖe edzi kloe be mate ŋui o
I never wanted to know	Nyemedi be manya gbeɖe o
Seems like a thousand years ago.	Edze abe ƒe akpe ɖeka enye sia ene.
Something that isn’t allowing me to live.	Nane si mele mɔ ɖem nam be manɔ agbe o.
I just should have been in it	Ðeko wòle be manɔ eme hafi
He seemed like a good kid.	Edze abe ɖevi nyui aɖe ene.
But in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t matter.	Gake le nuwo ƒe ɖoɖo gã la me la, mehiã o.
It’s really just a building.	Le nyateƒe me la, xɔ aɖe koe wònye.

This is about me now.	Esia ku ɖe ŋunye fifia.

You just can’t see them.	Ðeko màte ŋu akpɔ wo o.

He couldn’t let go of her.	Mete ŋu ɖe asi le eŋu o.
But it doesn’t matter.	Gake mehiã o.

This at least sounds true.	Esia ya teti ɖi nyateƒe.

But still, it is.	Gake ke hã, ele nenema.

Something is wrong there.	Nane gblẽ le afima.
I raised my hand	Medo asi ɖe dzi
It’s kind of important.	Ele vevie ƒomevi aɖe.
However, this book has some flaws.	Gake vodada aɖewo le agbalẽ sia me.
I really like that guy	Ŋutsu ma dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
It’s what these places have in common.	Enye nusi teƒe siawo sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
Perhaps you know this too.	Ðewohĩ wò hã ènya esia.
We’re doing everything right.	Míele nusianu wɔm nyuie.
He gave himself up.	Etsɔ eɖokui na.
I felt right at home there	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mele afima abe aƒeme ene
Mine didn’t have that.	Nye tɔ mekpɔ ema o.
That couldn’t have been the case.	Ema mate ŋu anye nenema hafi o.
Time has come, time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi va ɖo, ɣeyiɣi va yi.
But nothing went right.	Gake naneke meva yi nyuie o.
Only his voice changed.	Eƒe gbe koe trɔ.
You know how you are.	Ènya ale si nèle.
I want to have a job	Medi be dɔ aɖe nanɔ asinye
He needs your help now.	Ehiã wò kpekpeɖeŋu fifia.
I want everything you have.	Medi nusianu si le asiwò.
It was just too small.	Ðeko wònɔ sue akpa.
I told him everything about you	Megblɔ nya sia nya nɛ tso ŋuwò
Or maybe it’s the other way around.	Alo ɖewohĩ to vovo na emae.
I told them the truth	Megblɔ nyateƒea na wo
It wasn’t like it was.	Menye abe alesi wònɔ ene o.
But it’s an idea of ​​his.	Gake eƒe susu aɖee.
He can’t handle anything.	Mate ŋu akpɔ naneke gbɔ o.
I can't believe what he's done now	Nyemeka ɖe nusi wòwɔ fifia dzi o
I only stayed two nights	Zã eve koe menɔ afima
The hand touches you.	Asi la ka asi ŋuwò.
Everything just pissed them off.	Ðeko nusianu do dziku na wo.
He didn’t want to do this either.	Medi be yeawɔ esia hã o.
I'm really sorry about that	Meɖe kuku ŋutɔŋutɔ ɖe ema ta
It was his first novel	Enye eƒe agbalẽ gbãtɔ
This can be fatal	Esia ate ŋu awu ame
Some people won’t do anything for you.	Ame aɖewo mawɔ naneke na wò o.
I promise you it will work.	Medo ŋugbe na wò be awɔ dɔ.
It’s not a good thing at all.	Menye nu nyui aɖeke kura o.

He escaped from it.	Esi le eŋu.
I should have worked harder	Ðe wòle be mawɔ dɔ sesĩe wu hafi
Few grew up well.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe tsi nyuie.
This is a very good one.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ.
I was able to play more music.	Mete ŋu ƒoa ha geɖe wu.
That was after that.	Ema nye le ema megbe.
I did it in a way.	Mewɔe le mɔ aɖe nu.
No one could resist him.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
You know this now.	Ènya esia fifia.
And the voice he had.	Eye gbe si nɔ esi.
In many cases, this is absolutely true.	Le go geɖe me la, esia nye nyateƒe kura.
It is amazing how much he can do.	Nusi gbegbe ate ŋu awɔ la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It doesn’t seem necessary.	Edze abe mehiã o ene.
I can’t stand it anymore	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi le eme azɔ o
A man came home after a long time	Ŋutsu aɖe va aƒeme le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe megbe
I hope he finds something	Mele mɔ kpɔm be akpɔ nane
I can explain everything to you	Mate ŋu aɖe nusianu me na wò
I didn’t have that time	Ɣeyiɣi ma menɔ asinye o
He couldn’t just cover everything.	Mete ŋu ƒo nusianu ta ko o.

It’s just kind of weird.	Nu ƒomevi aɖe si mewɔ nuku o koe wònye.

I want to apologize	Medi be maɖe kuku
It will be a great hour.	Anye gaƒoƒo gã aɖe ŋutɔ.

No work is required.	Dɔ aɖeke mehiã o.

I made a few of these dresses this summer	Mewɔ awu siawo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo le dzomeŋɔli sia me
I didn’t understand anything about it	Nyemese naneke gɔme le eŋu o
I got a little too close.	Mete ɖe ŋunye vie akpa.
These things don’t exist.	Nu siawo meli o.
A large sea.	Ƒu gã aɖe.
This makes sense to him.	Susu le esia me nɛ.
I told them that was the one right there.	Megblɔ na wo be emae nye esi le afima tututu.
It was a real surprise.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I have never been able to call you	Nyemete ŋu ƒoa ka na wò kpɔ o
Otherwise, he can live with the loss.	Ne menye nenema o la, ate ŋu anɔ agbe kple nusi bu la.
That’s a lot at this point.	Ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
I know what they’re going to do	Menya nu si woawɔ
I think he is doing well though	Mesusu be ele edzi dzem nyuie ke hã
It will do just fine.	Awɔe nyuie ko.
And that can’t be good.	Eye ema mate ŋu anyo o.
It was a great thing for me.	Enye nu gã aɖe nam ŋutɔ.
It’s just a big part of my life.	Nye agbe ƒe akpa gã aɖe koe wònye.
He didn’t see how he could.	Mekpɔ alesi wòate ŋui o.
Just do the right thing.	Nu si le eteƒe koe wɔ.
It’s really a personal preference.	Enye ame ŋutɔ ƒe didi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I didn’t expect that	Nyemekpɔ mɔ nenema o
I had a great week.	Kwasiɖa nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ asinye.

I fought to stay focused	Mewɔ avu be nye susu nanɔ nu ŋu
I really had nothing to do	Naneke menɔ asinye ŋutɔŋutɔ mawɔ o
Some things last a long time.	Nu aɖewo nɔa anyi didi.
I only want what is best for you	Nusi nyo na wò koe medi be mawɔ
There was too much money in it.	Ga geɖe akpa nɔ eme.
This doesn’t have to be the case.	Mehiã be esia nanɔ nenema o.
I have more reason than that	Susu le asinye wu ema
I came to tell him that.	Meva be magblɔ nya ma nɛ.
He will definitely do that.	Awɔe nenema godoo.
I hope people give us a chance	Mele mɔ kpɔm be amewo ana mɔnukpɔkpɔ mí
You can’t just keep going.	Màte ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim ko o.
I want to try once.	Medi be mate kpɔ zi ɖeka.
And you can do it for hours.	Eye àte ŋu awɔe gaƒoƒo geɖe.

I don’t want more than I deserve.	Nyemedi nu geɖe wu esi dze nam o.
Do a great job.	Wɔ dɔ gã aɖe.
I hope someone is there	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ame aɖe le afima
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I was so angry.	Medo dziku ale gbegbe.
You can do anything with your life.	Àte ŋu awɔ nusianu kple wò agbe.
And this book is equally fresh.	Eye agbalẽ sia hã le yeye nenema ke.
We can’t stay here either.	Míate ŋu anɔ afisia hã o.

A real man man.	Ŋutsu ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutsu.
Take a look at them.	Lé ŋku ɖe wo ŋu.
Eventually, this will pass.	Mlɔeba la, esia ava yi.
We have everything here.	Nusianu le mía si le afisia.
But he didn’t know anything.	Gake menya naneke o.
And it can be there.	Eye ate ŋu anɔ afima.
I’ve done this before, at home.	Mewɔ esia do ŋgɔ, le aƒeme.

Looking forward to seeing you all there!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be makpɔ mi katã le afima!.
But we had each other.	Gake mía nɔewo nɔ mía si.
He’s right up there with everyone.	Eƒe nɔnɔme sɔ le afima tututu kple amesiame.
Maybe I don’t know today	Ðewohĩ nyemenya egbea o
You really can’t foresee what might happen.	Le nyateƒe me la, màte ŋu akpɔ nusi ate ŋu adzɔ do ŋgɔ o.
I really want to see you	Medi vevie be makpɔ wò
The little house greets us.	Aƒe sue la le gbe dom na mí.
It is not unreasonable.	Menye nusi me susu mele o ye o.
And he wasn’t the only one worried either.	Eye menye eya ɖeka koe tsi dzi hã o.
But it won’t surprise you or me.	Gake mawɔ nuku na wò alo nye ŋutɔ o.
A few hours each time.	Gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo ɣesiaɣi.
Now he's not so sure.	Fifia meka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o.
You never knew it was there.	Mènya kpɔ be ele afima o.
I have never felt so helpless	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke o nenema gbegbe o
You also know that it can take a lot of time.	Ènya hã be ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
I stayed here for one night	Metsi afisia zã ɖeka
I needed to play something	Ehiã be maƒo nane
Angry, but not at all surprised.	Dziku, gake mewɔ nuku kura o.
I really wanted to do something completely different.	Medi vevie be mawɔ nane si to vovo kura.
I shouldn’t talk about it.	Mele be maƒo nu tso eŋu o.
I hope he's not home now	Mele mɔ kpɔm be megale aƒeme fifia o
You may not be able to understand it at all.	Ðewohĩ màte ŋu ase egɔme kura o.
I hurried into my room.	Mewɔ kaba ge ɖe nye xɔ me.
I resisted it.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu.
Like it was my very life.	Abe alesi wònye nye agbe tututu ene.
I did that for another year, once a week	Mewɔe nenema ƒe bubu, zi ɖeka le kwasiɖa me
I just didn’t expect it so soon.	Ðeko nyemekpɔ mɔ nɛ kaba nenema o.
But none of them worked there for more than a week.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ dɔ le afima wu kwasiɖa ɖeka o.
I think it’s obvious	Mesusu be edze ƒã
I thought I could breathe out	Mesusu be mate ŋu ado ya le eme
I’m not sure exactly how long	Nyemeka ɖe ɣeyiɣi didi kae tututu dzi o
There is no one to help you.	Ame aɖeke meli akpe ɖe ŋuwò o.
I couldn’t help but ask one little question	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o, gake mebia nya sue ɖeka ko
This is very easy for the police.	Esia le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ na kpovitɔwo.
Everyone was a little nervous.	Amesiame tsi dzodzodzoe vie.
I just need to get my life together somehow	Ðeko wòle be maƒo nye agbe nu ƒu le mɔ aɖe nu
The meeting is over.	Kpekpea wu enu.

Some people were nervous.	Ame aɖewo tsi dzodzodzoe.
I felt like a part of me had died.	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe nye akpa aɖe ku ene.
These ideas are amazing.	Susu siawo wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
None of us are like that.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mele nenema o.

I don’t think anyone can do it visually.	Nyemesusu be ame aɖeke ate ŋu awɔe to ŋku dzi o.
Let me say that up front.	Mina magblɔ nya ma le ŋgɔ.
I can’t say anything.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I rejected your first book	Megbe wò agbalẽ gbãtɔ
There are two problems with this.	Kuxi eve le esia ŋu.
I was always trying alone and I was trying alone in life	Nye ɖeka koe nɔa agbagba dzem ɣesiaɣi eye nye ɖeka koe nɔa agbagba dzem le agbe me
I really wonder what is going on in his head	Mebiaa ɖokuinye ŋutɔŋutɔ be nukae le edzi yim le eƒe ta me hã
No one was anywhere yet.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afi aɖeke haɖe o.

I am fine with that.	Mele nyuie le nya ma me.
I shouldn’t have gone	Mele be mayi hafi o
I doubt it, but maybe	Meke ɖi le eŋu, gake ɖewohĩ
That was enough for me.	Ema sɔ gbɔ nam ŋutɔ.
That’s just one thing.	Nu ɖeka koe nye ema.
I needed to see his face	Ehiã be makpɔ eƒe mo
I need to know more.	Ele be manya nu geɖe wu.
Nothing there to surprise us.	Naneke mele afima si awɔ nuku na mí o.
It’s important to me.	Ele vevie nam.

You had a very good life.	Agbe nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ asiwò.
He had no face.	Eƒe mo aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
The thing is as hard as a rock.	Nu la sesẽ abe kpe ene.

Take the money.	Xɔ ga la.
I saw them interacting	Mekpɔ wo wole nu wɔm ɖekae
He wasn’t ready for this.	Menɔ klalo na esia o.

That makes sense, in some ways.	Susu le nya ma me, le mɔ aɖewo nu.
It would be to protect my people	Anye be makpɔ nye amewo ta
This is true in more ways than one.	Esia nye nyateƒe le mɔ geɖe nu wu ɖeka.

But he couldn’t feel that way.	Gake mete ŋu se le eɖokui me nenema o.

I couldn’t tell which one it was	Nyemete ŋu nya esi wònye o
I can’t let myself go.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu o.

Honestly, my life was ruined in a week.	Le nyateƒe me la, nye agbe gblẽ le kwasiɖa ɖeka me.

This trend will only continue.	Ðeko nɔnɔme sia ayi edzi.
Or he will do so.	Alo awɔe nenema.

We can’t do that.	Míate ŋu awɔe nenema o.

No one knows where he is.	Ame aɖeke menya afi si wòle o.

It is a difficult situation.	Enye nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe.
I wasn’t sure at that point	Nyemeka ɖe edzi le ɣeyiɣi ma me o
Time has changed a lot in life.	Ɣeyiɣi trɔ nu geɖe le agbe me.
It was only two months.	Ɣleti eve koe wònye.
I think this is true in life as well	Mesusu be esia nye nyateƒe le agbe me hã
I didn’t want to bother him	Nyemedi be maɖe fu nɛ o
No substance contains more than one gas phase.	Nu aɖeke meli si me ya ƒe akpa si wu ɖeka le o.

Like that was going to work.	Abe alesi ema nɔ dɔ wɔ ge ene.

I felt very strongly about it, you know	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ, ènya
On everything and nothing.	Le nusianu dzi eye naneke meli o.

And the child joined him.	Eye ɖevi la hã wɔ ɖeka kplii.

However, some things remained the same.	Ke hã, nu aɖewo gakpɔtɔ nɔ nenema.

I can’t speak better than that	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu nyuie wu ema o
Madi you	Madi wo
You always knew what to do in the past.	Ènya nusi nàwɔ ɣesiaɣi va yi.
I tell you why this is so important to me	Megblɔ nusita esia le vevie nam alea gbegbe la na mi
Click on it twice.	Zi edzi zi eve.
This should be done once a year.	Ele be woawɔ esia zi ɖeka ƒe sia ƒe.
Take a closer look.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie.
I had nothing to say	Nya aɖeke menɔ asinye magblɔ o
I don’t know if that’s true.	Nyemenya nenye be nya ma nye nyateƒe o.
We have a man.	Ŋutsu aɖe le mía si.
But it didn’t seem to work.	Gake edze abe mewɔ dɔ o ene.
I want to do something about it.	Medi be mawɔ nane tso eŋu.
And just think about this.	Eye bu esia ŋu kpɔ ko.
I explained it to them and that was that	Meɖe eme na wo eye emae nye ema
Neither that nor he has ever made a mistake.	Ema alo eya ŋutɔ mewɔ vodada kpɔ o.
But your car is fine.	Gake wò ʋu la nyo.
He would never do it.	Mawɔe gbeɖe o.
I can’t see the sight.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nu o.
Or he couldn’t escape.	Alo mete ŋu si o.
He is doing good with the house.	Ele nu nyui wɔm kple aƒea.
But what can he do if one of them.	Gake nukae wòate ŋu awɔ ne wo dometɔ ɖeka.
Or your time, today.	Alo wò ɣeyiɣi, egbea.
You may not have time.	Ðewohĩ ɣeyiɣi manɔ asiwò o.
I couldn’t think of anyone	Nyemete ŋu bu ame aɖeke ŋu o
It’s as if life is a part of this process.	Ðeko wòle abe ɖe agbe nye akpa aɖe le ɖoɖo sia me ene.
This is not new.	Menye nu yeye le esia me o.
I have an hour to live	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka le asinye manɔ agbe
I only had it for a year	Ƒe ɖeka koe wònɔ asinye
I already know what the end result will be	Menya nusi ado tso eme mlɔeba xoxo
I had nowhere to go	Afi aɖeke menɔ asinye mayi o
I know it is as true as he is	Menya be enye nyateƒe abe eya ke ene
This is not easy.	Esia mele bɔbɔe o.
I need to stay in a clear head	Ele be manɔ ta si me kɔ nyuie
I was really starting to like him	Meva nɔ eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔŋutɔ
I don’t know what to do, really.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o, le nyateƒe me.
I question why so many others don’t.	Meke ɖi nusita ame bubu geɖe mewɔe nenema o.
I have enough on my mind without it	Nusi sɔ gbɔ le susu me nam esia manɔmee
They must have food.	Ele be nuɖuɖu nanɔ wo si.
To my surprise, this worked	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ be esia wɔ dɔ
There is something for everyone.	Nane li na ame sia ame.
I always have been, and always will be	Menɔ anyi ɣesiaɣi, eye manɔ anyi ɣesiaɣi
I decided to tell him the truth	Meɖoe be magblɔ nyateƒea nɛ
I needed to find some space between us	Ehiã be makpɔ teƒe aɖe le mía dome
He had a very complicated life.	Agbe si me kɔ ŋutɔ nɔ esi.
Everything seemed quite normal.	Edze abe nusianu sɔ kura ene.
What could have happened .	Nusi ate ŋu adzɔ hafi .
What I did.	Nusi mewɔ.
Something that is interesting.	Nu si doa dzidzɔ na ame.
A lot of them, actually	Wo dometɔ geɖe, le nyateƒe me
He has something about us.	Nane le esi le mía ŋu.
Or about the process.	Alo le ɖoɖo si wɔm wole ŋu.
I finally got something working	Meva kpɔ nane si le dɔ wɔm mlɔeba
You can also create your own character.	Àte ŋu awɔ wò ŋutɔ wò nɔnɔme hã.
I fired them	Meɖe wo le dɔ me
There are actually two problems with this.	Le nyateƒe me la, kuxi eve aɖewo le esia ŋu.
This only takes a few days.	Ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe esia xɔa.
I will work on it.	Mawɔ dɔ le eŋu.
I would have thought I was alone	Anye ne mesusu be nye ɖeka koe li hafi
His first season was impressive.	Eƒe ɣeyiɣi gbãtɔ si wòwɔ la wɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
I want to know what is wrong with me	Medi be manya nu si le fu ɖem nam
I need some time to myself	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi aɖe na ɖokuinye
The point is clear.	Nya la me kɔ nyuie.
I wanted to do as little with them as possible	Medi be mawɔ nu boo aɖeke kpli wo alesi mate ŋui
But something is wrong.	Gake nane gblẽ.
There is no way he is going through life.	Mɔ aɖeke meli si dzi wòle agbe tom le o.
Foot and foot.	Afɔ kple afɔ.
I had to do the same for him	Ele be mawɔ nenema ke nɛ
If you like it, please buy a copy.	Ne edzɔ dzi na wò la, taflatse ƒle eƒe ɖe.
I hoped he could understand	Mekpɔ mɔ be ate ŋu ase egɔme
I can’t remember the last time that happened	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku zi mamlɛtɔ si nu ma dzɔ la dzi o
I hope I enjoy that one	Mele mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe ɖeka ma ŋu
Please let me know what works best for you.	Taflatse na manya nusi awɔ dɔ nyuie na wò.
Maybe just having someone with us is enough.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe nanɔ anyi kpli mí ko sɔ gbɔ.
I had no one to call	Ame aɖeke menɔ asinye maƒo ka na o
I can't achieve that from the project though.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo nu ma gbɔ tso dɔa me o gake.
Keep this name in mind.	Ŋkɔ sia nanɔ susu me na wò.
Very few of us fell.	Mía dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe dze anyi.
That is very easy to do.	Ema wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I would really like to know	Madi vevie be manya
There was something else.	Nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
Try.	Dze agbagba.
I can escape it	Mate ŋu asi le eme
I can also end your life	Mate ŋu awu wò agbe hã nu
He couldn’t have what he wanted.	Nusi dim wònɔ la mate ŋu anɔ esi o.
But, for some reason, it’s not working.	Gake, le susu aɖewo ta la, mele dɔ wɔm o.
He was a really tough guy.	Enye ŋutsu sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But still it doesn’t work.	Gake ke hã mewɔa dɔ o.
I can’t just get rid of it	Nyemate ŋu aɖee ɖa ko o
His head was almost clear.	Eƒe ta me kɔ nyuie kloe.
I want to make them now	Medi be mawɔ wo fifia
It is a different situation.	Nɔnɔme bubu aɖee wònye.
Think about that one.	Bu ɖeka ma ŋu kpɔ.
I'm very sorry.	Meɖe kuku ŋutɔ.
I decided to put this together about a month ago	Meɖoe be maƒo esia nu ƒu abe ɣleti ɖeka enye sia ene
Perhaps this is appropriate.	Ðewohĩ esia sɔ.
And see what happens.	Eye kpɔ nusi adzɔ ɖa.
Every word was trying hard.	Nya ɖesiaɖe nɔ agbagba dzem vevie.
I have to make my own food	Ele be nye ŋutɔ mawɔ nye nuɖuɖu
I was hoping to marry you	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be maɖe wò
I have to tell them where you are	Ele nam be magblɔ afisi nèle na wo
I just wish they had more	Ðeko medi be nu geɖe wu nanɔ wo si
I deserve better than this	Medze na nusi nyo wu esia
It wasn’t fast enough.	Mewɔ kaba ale gbegbe o.
This is not true.	Esia menye nyateƒe o.
This is no small matter.	Esia menye nya sue aɖeke o.
Everyone will know.	Amesiame anya.
You are either, or you are not.	Èle nenema, alo mèle nenema o.
He was very attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
The matter ends there.	Nya la wu enu le afima.
It’s really amazing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He’s got a smile on his face.	Eƒe lãme xɔ dzo.
I did it from week one	Mewɔe tso kwasiɖa gbãtɔ me ke
But there is a point.	Gake nya aɖe li.
I could understand his anger	Mete ŋu se eƒe dziku gɔme
I ask this.	Mebiaa esia.
I haven’t been able to do that yet	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nu ma haɖe o
You have to do the work yourself.	Ele be wò ŋutɔ nàwɔ dɔa.
I got angry and threw some stuff out there	Medo dziku eye metsɔ nu aɖewo ƒu gbe ɖe afima
I hope to get out and see that	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mado go akpɔ ema
But everything went well.	Gake nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
The project went ahead anyway.	Dɔa yi ŋgɔ le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I need to know what you really are	Ele be manya nusi tututu nènye
Heat at the same time, and it will work better.	Do dzo le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me, eye wòawɔ dɔ nyuie wu.
I only have two hands	Asi eve koe le asinye
I don’t know if that’s the case.	Nyemenya nenye be ele nenema o.
He had some hard days.	Ŋkeke sesẽ aɖewo va nɛ.
I know you are, obviously	Menya be ènye, edze ƒã be èle nenema
There is absolutely no reason.	Susu aɖeke kura meli o.
That makes more sense.	Susu le nya ma me wu.
He wouldn’t let go.	Maɖe asi le eŋu o.
I did so I wanted to marry you	Mewɔe nenema medi be maɖe wò
He would have liked that too.	Ema hã dzɔ dzi nɛ hafi.
A few hours earlier, that was a big deal.	Gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo do ŋgɔ la, nya gã aɖee nye ema.
One day it could have ended, but it didn’t	Gbe ɖeka la, ate ŋu awu enu hafi, gake mewɔe nenema o
In fact, it is going to be bad.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele gbegblẽ ge.
This makes sense.	Esia me susu le.
In it with all of you.	Le eme kple mi katã.
I came across it	Meva ke ɖe eŋu
Which probably isn’t much.	Nusi ɖewohĩ menye nu geɖe o.
I did it that way	Mewɔe nenema
We can’t do anything.	Míate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
I couldn’t do it for him	Nyemete ŋu wɔe nɛ o
That made no sense either.	Susu aɖeke menɔ nya ma hã ŋu o.
I would like to see something very soon	Madi be makpɔ nane kpuie ŋutɔ
I can never handle that	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ gbeɖe o
It’s very, very strange.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
Write a quick comment.	Ŋlɔ nya aɖe si nàgblɔ kaba.
This is also important.	Esia hã le vevie.
Everything in this room.	Nusianu si le xɔ sia me.
It was a great deal of fun.	Enye dzidzɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
It’s been a long time coming.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si gbɔna.
I can’t tell any of them.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
I heard nothing from home.	Nyemese naneke tso aƒeme o.
I have discouraged people	Meɖe dzi le amewo ƒo
I got this from here.	Mekpɔ esia tso afisia.
An idea entered his head	Susu aɖe ge ɖe eƒe ta me
That’s why I’m here.	Esia tae mele afisia ɖo.
Can anyone help me on how to figure that out.	Amesiame ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye le alesi mawɔ anya ema ŋui.
Close, but not quite.	Te ɖe eŋu, gake menye tututu o.
I was very worried.	Metsi dzi ŋutɔ.
I didn’t have anything	Naneke menɔ asinye o
Really expensive.	Xɔ asi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I just managed to stick with it.	Ðeko mete ŋu lé ɖe eŋu.
I have a little work to do tonight	Dɔ vi aɖe le asinye mawɔ le zã sia me
I saw what could happen	Mekpɔ nusi ate ŋu adzɔ
I needed to talk about it	Ehiã be maƒo nu tso eŋu
There were exceptions to this rule	Ame aɖewo nɔ anyi siwo to vovo na se sia
He still didn’t look away.	Meɖe ŋku ɖa kokoko o.
Or at least what used to be home.	Alo nusi nye aƒe tsã ya teti.
It doesn’t have to be true.	Mehiã be menye nyateƒe o.
Right in the pool.	Le ta la me tututu.
And in that first year.	Eye le ƒe gbãtɔ ma me.
It’s just not true.	Ðeko menye nyateƒe o.
I thought he was seeing someone else.	Mesusu be ele ame bubu aɖe kpɔm.
That book surprised him.	Agbalẽ ma wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
I saw you today.	Mekpɔ wò egbea.
There is another bad idea.	Susu gbegblẽ bubu aɖe hã li.
Blood is life.	Ʋu nye agbe.
I don’t want to see this	Nyemedi be makpɔ esia o
I really wanted to meet him.	Medi vevie be mado go.
I can do very little	Mate ŋu awɔ nu sue aɖe ko
Like he would do that.	Abe ɖe wòawɔ nu ma ene.
I couldn’t understand that.	Nyemete ŋu se nya ma gɔme o.
I just want to see how you are	Ðeko medi be makpɔ alesi nèle
I have no problem with the police	Kuxi aɖeke mele ŋunye kple kpovitɔwo o
According to this.	Le esia nu la.
One of them left.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka dzo.
I met him for a good hour or two	Medo go gaƒoƒo ɖeka alo eve nyuie
I really don’t know anything though	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya naneke o gake
So far today has been pretty good.	Vaseɖe fifia la, egbea nyo ŋutɔ.
A job that no one else can do.	Dɔ si ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ o.
Let me see what’s wrong with it.	Mina makpɔ nusi gblẽ le eŋu.
But I can never remember which is which	Gake nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku esi nye esi dzi gbeɖe o
We could have done more.	Míate ŋu awɔ geɖe wu hafi.
I needed to say something	Ehiã be magblɔ nya aɖe
You know what will happen.	Ènya nusi adzɔ.
The things he did were amazing.	Nu siwo wòwɔ la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I'm not one to say this works or doesn't work.	Menye ame aɖee menye si agblɔ be esia wɔa dɔ alo mewɔa dɔ o.
I apologize for being a little late	Meɖe kuku be metsi megbe vie
He will never know.	Manya gbeɖe o.
I think you will enjoy it	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò
Please help me for the same.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye le nenema ke ta.
I know someone who can help	Menya ame aɖe si ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu
I don’t see anything wrong with it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si gblẽ le eŋu o.
I’m not sure what they’re going to do, but it’s real.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi woawɔ dzi o, gake enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He is a character.	Enye ame si ƒe nɔnɔme le abe ame ene.
I was trying to find you, but I couldn’t	Menɔ agbagba dzem be madi wò, gake nyemete ŋui o
He wouldn’t say anything.	Magblɔ nya aɖeke o.
It’s not an easy life.	Menye agbe si le bɔbɔe o.
I know better about it	Menya nu tso eŋu nyuie wu
We can do it any old time.	Míate ŋu awɔe le ɣeyiɣi xoxo ɖesiaɖe me.
And the work continued.	Eye dɔa yi edzi.
That would be too personal.	Ema anye ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa.
There is no turning back.	Trɔ yi megbe meli o.
But inside, he was anything but.	Gake le eme la, enye nusianu gake.
I am just getting started	Ðeko mele egɔme dzem
I don’t understand any of them	Nyemese wo dometɔ aɖeke gɔme o
I couldn’t do anything.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
I really liked the idea	Susu la dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
It was a nice place.	Enye teƒe nyui aɖe.
I had an issue to deal with	Nya aɖe nɔ asinye si gbɔ wòle be makpɔ
It is a very good arrangement.	Enye ɖoɖo nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I love all the books they have there	Agbalẽ siwo katã le wo si le afima la dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
I had so much to do yesterday	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ asinye mawɔ etsɔ
It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
I think it’s relatively stable	Mesusu be eƒe nɔnɔme li ke vie
A time or two.	Ɣeyiɣi ɖeka alo eve.
I couldn’t keep going	Nyemete ŋu yi edzi nɔ edzi yim o
We are really like that.	Míele nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It just doesn’t match reality.	Ðeko mewɔ ɖeka kple nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
And if so, it’s smart.	Eye ne ele nenema la, ke edze aɖaŋu.
I may have to do this more often	Ðewohĩ ahiã be mawɔ esia zi geɖe wu
Check.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu.
He'll soon find out exactly what he's doing here.	Akpɔ nusi tututu wɔm wòle le afisia kpuie.
You clearly know what’s wrong.	Ènya nusi gblẽ la eme kɔ ƒã.
I needed to live my own life	Ehiã be manɔ nye ŋutɔ nye agbe me
Actually, I am that person.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyee nye ame ma.
People are angry.	Amewo do dziku.
They are like that.	Wole nenema.
I couldn’t help myself	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe ɖokuinye nu o
I have never felt this way before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me alea kpɔ o
That is absolutely true.	Nya ma nye nyateƒe kura.
He did a really good job.	Ewɔ nu nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I rejected that.	Megbe nya ma.
I didn’t like it at all	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu kura o
I couldn’t send money	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ga ɖa o
I just got to see you in person	Ðeko meva kpɔ wò ŋutɔŋutɔ
I wasn’t sure what to say at the meeting.	Nyemeka ɖe nya si magblɔ le kpekpea me dzi o.
This isn’t much.	Esia menye nu geɖe o.
The word that doesn’t exist	Nya si meli o
It has never been like that.	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o.
I deserve time for me.	Medze na ɣeyiɣi nam.
I probably don’t need to tell you that	Anɔ eme be mehiã be magblɔ nya ma na wò o
Everything was going well.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie.
I am looking forward to it very much	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie ŋutɔ
I took care of them.	Nyee kpɔ wo dzi.
He didn’t let go all the way home.	Meɖe asi le mɔ bliboa dzi yi aƒeme o.
I was able to do that anyway.	Nye ya mete ŋu wɔe nenema le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I only got his name this morning	Eƒe ŋkɔ koe mexɔ ŋdi sia
I enjoy my job.	Nye dɔa dzɔa dzi nam.
But I had to act quickly	Gake ele nam be mawɔ nu kaba
Not sure where this will go	Nyemeka ɖe afi si esia ayi dzi o
Cough.	Kpe.
And a year in fact.	Eye ƒe ɖeka xɔ le nyateƒe me.
This is not my car.	Esia menye nye ʋu o.
We had to work at night.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ le zã me.
I just couldn’t think of it that way	Ðeko nyemete ŋu bu eŋu nenema o
He didn’t see anyone.	Mekpɔ ame aɖeke o.
I can’t tell you anything else	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya bubu aɖeke na mi o
It is a difficult place.	Enye teƒe sesẽ aɖe.
I didn’t know what else to say to her	Nyemenya nya bubu si magblɔ nɛ o
Check them out here.	Kpɔ wo ɖa le afisia.
He just hoped it wasn't too late.	Ðeko wònɔ mɔ kpɔm be metsi megbe akpa o.
He did that so well.	Ewɔ ema nyuie ale gbegbe.
That’s not what you want.	Menye emae nye nusi dim nèle o.
I have never felt this way about anyone	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me alea kpɔ le ame aɖeke ŋu o
I couldn’t bear to look at his face	Nyemete ŋu do dzi be makpɔ eƒe mo o
He never got there.	Meɖo afima kpɔ o.
Something no one else knows.	Nane si ame bubu aɖeke menya o.
I would be very surprised.	Awɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
The problem there was very different.	Kuxi si nɔ afima la to vovo kura.
There is nothing, there is nothing.	Naneke meli o, naneke meli o.

I wasn’t sure what would happen at all	Nyemeka ɖe nusi adzɔ dzi kura o
It is our lot in life.	Enye míaƒe akpa si le agbe me.
I'm on it.	Mele edzi.
I couldn’t eat now	Nyemete ŋu ɖu nu fifia o
I stayed there for about a year	Menɔ afima abe ƒe ɖeka ene
I know the truth.	Menya nyateƒea.
But you know, he never asked.	Gake ènya, mebia gbeɖe o.

He couldn’t see anything.	Mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
Nothing like this, anyway.	Naneke mele abe esia ene o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
There are some who misunderstand this.	Ame aɖewo li siwo mese nya sia gɔme nyuie o.
Go out to them.	Do go wo.
I had just done the impossible	Ðeko mewɔ nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o koe nye ema
Pretty much something for everyone	Nane kloe na amesiame
It was a mistake on my part.	Enye vodada le nye akpa dzi.

I didn’t want to bother him	Nyemedi be maɖe fu nɛ o

But for this reason.	Gake le esia ta.
This can be very expensive.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ asi ŋutɔ.
There is another in his mouth.	Bubu hã le eƒe nu me.

We can go nowhere, we can do nothing .	Míate ŋu ayi afi aɖeke o, míate ŋu awɔ naneke o .

In fact, this is not true.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia menye nyateƒe o.
He never knew who you were.	Menya ame si nèle kpɔ o.
He wasn’t going to do it.	Menye ɖe wòle ewɔ ge o.

An idea took shape.	Susu aɖe va nɔ nɔnɔme aɖe me.
One thing in the money	Nu ɖeka aɖe si le ga me
If you like someone, you like them.	Ne ame aɖe ƒe nu lé dzi na wò la, ke eƒe nu lé dzi na wò.
But maybe it’s because it’s not summer yet.	Gake ɖewohĩ esi dzomeŋɔli meɖo haɖe o tae.
This seems like a good idea.	Edze abe esia nye susu nyui aɖe ene.
I want to be like the wind	Medi be manɔ abe ya ene
I can’t figure out what it is	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi wònye o
But there is actually another way.	Gake mɔ bubu aɖe hã li ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There was only one problem.	Kuxi ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
It doesn’t touch your heart.	Meka asi wò dzi ŋu o.
He couldn’t speak.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu o.
I wanted that horse more than life itself	Medi sɔ ma wu agbe ŋutɔ
Go really forward.	Yi ŋgɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I was going to do it anyway.	Menɔ ewɔ ge le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I did a great job with him	Mewɔ dɔ gã aɖe kplii
Life, that is.	Agbe, si nye.
So far.	Vaseɖe fifia.
You made a very valid point.	Ègblɔ nya aɖe si sɔ ŋutɔ.
I saw you when you didn’t know	Mekpɔ wò esime mènya o
I need you to do that for me, right now	Mehiã be nàwɔ ema nam, fifia tututu
I am personally convinced that the food here is excellent	Nye ŋutɔ meka ɖe edzi be nuɖuɖu si le afisia nyo ŋutɔ
All of them, well.	Wo katã, nyuie.
I just always wanted to create	Ðeko medi ɣesiaɣi be mawɔ nu
I became very anxious and needed help	Meva tsi dzi vevie eye mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu
I absolutely needed to have this	Ehiã vevie ŋutɔ be esia nanɔ asinye
And one for his car.	Eye ɖeka na eƒe ʋu.
There’s just so much going on.	Nu geɖe koe le edzi yim.
Now he is not as angry as he used to be.	Fifia megale dziku dom abe alesi wònɔ ene o.
I am a piece of your mind	Nyee nye wò susu ƒe akpa aɖe
That is more than just death.	Ema de ŋgɔ wu ku ko.
I can’t do anything.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
I think we can beat everybody	Mesusu be míate ŋu aɖu amesiame dzi
His face fell on me.	Eƒe mo ƒo ɖe dzinye.
Just the thing, maybe.	Nu la koe, ɖewohĩ.
I want to know what’s inside	Medi be manya nusi le eme
Something else did.	Nu bubu aɖe hã wɔe.
I explained everything to them	Meɖe nusianu me na wo
I cannot emphasize this more.	Nyemate ŋu ate gbe ɖe esia dzi wu ema o.
I have to do anything with this	Ele be mawɔ nusianu kple esia
I wanted what he was on	Medi nusi dzi wòle
I have to do it.	Ele be mawɔe.
If you are, though.	Nenye be wò hã, ke hã.
This is your business.	Esia nye wò nya.
I’ve been there before.	Meva afima kpɔ.
I can only imagine what it was like for him	Ðeko mate ŋu akpɔ alesi wònɔ nɛ le susu me
I was just there.	Ðeko menɔ afima.
The same thing happened to me.	Nu ma ke dzɔ ɖe dzinye.
But there is no chance.	Gake mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke meli o.
I don’t want to work	Nyemedi be mawɔ dɔ o
A child does so much.	Vi aɖe wɔa nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
I just wanted to.	Ðeko medi.
You can work hard.	Àte ŋu awɔ dɔ sesĩe.
I can’t accept something like that	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nane si le abe ema ene o
This isn’t a bad thing.	Esia menye nu gbegblẽ o.
Step in here.	Ðe afɔ ɖe afisia.
I needed to talk to him	Ehiã be maƒo nu kplii
That’s what it is.	Emae nye ema.
Things will get better.	Nuwo ava nyo ɖe edzi.
But maybe it’s something else.	Gake ɖewohĩ nu bubu aɖee.
You are just getting started.	Ðeko nèle egɔme dzem.
I bought you with a price	Metsɔ asi aɖe ƒle wò
This isn’t me.	Menye nyee nye esia o.
The work is excellent.	Dɔa nyo ŋutɔ.
I know the situation here is a good one	Menya be nɔnɔme si me wòle le afisia nye nɔnɔme nyui aɖe
I think you will enjoy it.	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò.
I decided to go a while ago.	Meɖoe be mayi ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
He will need a lot of help.	Ahiã kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe.
It can happen anywhere.	Ate ŋu adzɔ le afi sia afi.
I can’t seem to get a handle on it	Edze abe nyemate ŋu akpɔ asi le eŋu o ene
Not until now.	Menye vaseɖe fifia o.
A bit surprising, actually.	Nusi wɔ nuku vie, le nyateƒe me.
Turn on the heat.	Do dzo ɖe edzi.
But there must be another way.	Gake ele be mɔ bubu aɖe nanɔ anyi.
Not exactly, but not much more.	Menye tututu o, gake menye nu geɖe wu ema o.
I ordered him, too	Meɖe gbe nɛ hã
I don’t know much about them.	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso wo ŋu o.
We had space, lots of space.	Teƒe nɔ mía si, teƒe geɖe nɔ mía si.
He would find his car soon enough.	Akpɔ eƒe ʋua kaba ale gbegbe.
But it can go too far.	Gake ate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ akpa.
I want you, all of you	Medi mi, mi katã
That really hit me.	Ema ƒo ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
But only briefly.	Gake kpuie ko.
I will go with him tonight	Mayi kplii le zã sia me
He couldn’t do it now.	Mete ŋu wɔe fifia o.
And you’re not going to set anything.	Eye mèle naneke ɖo ge o.
Put one on it.	Do ɖeka ɖe edzi.
I really liked this thing.	Nu sia dze ŋunye ŋutɔ.
I remember this one guy used to come	Meɖo ŋku edzi be ŋutsu ɖeka sia va tsã
I really like that about you	Ema dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ le ŋuwò
I would love that	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be ema
I wondered what was in it	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae le eme hã
I don’t know what’s more true	Nyemenya nusi nye nyateƒe wu o
I brought a dress with me just in case	Metsɔ awu aɖe ɖe asi nenye be edzɔ be nane dzɔ ɖe edzi
Not like me.	Menye abe nye ene o.
I’m glad he’s here.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ele afisia.
So many good books, so few moments.	Agbalẽ nyui geɖe ŋutɔ, ɣeyiɣi ʋɛ aɖewo koe li.
It’s been a while.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
We are going to kill each other.	Míele mía nɔewo wu ge.
But the fire.	Gake dzo.
If you have a skill.	Ne aɖaŋu aɖe le asiwò.
And yet everything changed.	Eye ke hã nusianu trɔ.
You still have some work to do anyway.	Dɔ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ li nàwɔ le mɔ ɖesiaɖe nu.
I still have several of them	Wo dometɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ le asinye
But he couldn't remember that part either.	Gake mete ŋu ɖo ŋku akpa ma hã dzi o.
In fact, you can.	Le nyateƒe me la, àte ŋui.
I’ve seen them’.	Mekpɔ wo’.
I remember that vividly	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi nyuie
I have to be working.	Ele be manɔ dɔ wɔm.
I need to know what it looks like	Ele be manya alesi wòle
Ya la ku.	Ya la ku.
It’s not convenient for them.	Menye nusi sɔ na wo o.
He has a lot to do.	Nu geɖe le esi wòawɔ.
I had a lot to say to him	Nya geɖe nɔ asinye magblɔ nɛ
Only he could have done that.	Eya koe ate ŋu awɔ ema hafi.
I need to get out a bit	Ele be mado go vie
It surprised them all.	Ewɔ nuku na wo katã.
I was trying to get out	Menɔ agbagba dzem be mado go
It never will be and never was.	Manɔ nenema gbeɖe o eye menɔ nenema hã gbeɖe o.
This can happen to any of us.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe mía dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe dzi.
I can only stay a few days	Ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe mate ŋu anɔ anyi
I will talk to him.	Maƒo nu kplii.
I don’t know if that plan still exists.	Nyemenya ne ɖoɖo ma gakpɔtɔ li o.
That’s an obvious bad thing.	Ema nye nu gbegblẽ si dze ƒã.
I knew exactly what I was going to do	Menya nusi tututu mawɔ
Use them wisely.	Zã wo nyuie.
I don’t see the big deal	Nyemekpɔ nya gã la o
This has become very expensive	Esia va xɔ asi ŋutɔ
That didn’t do it.	Ema mewɔe o.
He would, if he could.	Awɔe, ne ate ŋui.
Came very close to him.	Va te ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ.
That is the truth.	Emae nye nyateƒea.
I should have called him today	Ðe wòle be maƒo ka nɛ egbea hafi
There is no problem here.	Kuxi aɖeke mele afisia o.
There was a problem.	Kuxi aɖe nɔ anyi.
It was a wonderful thing.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
And yet we know nothing about it.	Eye ke hã míenya naneke tso eŋu o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I really like this song	Ha sia dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
No wonder they would do something like this.	Mewɔ nuku o be woawɔ nane si le abe esia ene.
That used to be pretty easy.	Ema nɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ tsã.
I really can’t help myself	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o
I hardly knew what to tell him.	Nyemenya nusi magblɔ nɛ kura o.
I was just like that, too.	Nye hã menɔ nenema ko.
No one said anything to him.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke nɛ o.
I'll do that one thing for myself	Mawɔ nu ɖeka ma na ɖokuinye
Know your person.	Nya wò ame.
It happened before that.	Edzɔ do ŋgɔ na ema.
His voice, too.	Eƒe gbe hã.
I just told you that	Ðeko megblɔ nya ma na wò
This is a very good idea.	Esia nye susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
We can do it in a reasonable way.	Míate ŋu awɔe le mɔ si sɔ nu.
I didn’t really know what was going on	Nyemenya nusi tututu nɔ edzi yim o
I hope all is well	Mekpɔ mɔ be wo katã wole nyuie
I don’t think that’s right	Nyemesusu be esia sɔ o
We have you now.	Wòe le mía si fifia.
Go a week without your voice.	Yi kwasiɖa ɖeka wò gbe manɔmee.
Which is good for the dog.	Nukae nyo na avu la.
I wish we were closer	Ne ɖe míate ɖe mía nɔewo ŋu wu la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
There would be no money in it for me.	Ga aɖeke manɔ eme nam o.
I could never stand it	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu gbeɖe o
I'm just running.	Ðeko mele du dzi.
I couldn’t stand spoiling myself or anyone else	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe gbegblẽ nu na ɖokuinye alo ame bubu aɖeke o
He may not have it.	Ðewohĩ manɔ eŋu o.
Maybe we can actually find something.	Ðewohĩ míate ŋu ake ɖe nane ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Quite the opposite is true.	Nusi to vovo kura na emae nye nyateƒe.
I can find my own way	Nye ŋutɔ mate ŋu adi nye mɔ
I think I care about him personally.	Mesusu be nye ŋutɔ metsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ.
This person can’t kill you.	Ame sia mate ŋu awu wò o.
I fell and almost fell	Medze anyi eye medze anyi kloe
Things have to be done.	Ele be woawɔ nuwo.
No eyes in the back of my head	Ŋku aɖeke mele nye ta megbe o
I’ve never felt this way about a man.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me alea le ŋutsu aɖe ŋu kpɔ o.
Now any negativity is personal.	Fifia nu gbegblẽ ɖesiaɖe nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
I couldn’t do anything about it	Nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke tso eŋu o
I can’t explain it now	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eme fifia o
Right up to the head.	Vaseɖe ta dzi tututu.
I didn’t understand it at all	Nyemese egɔme kura o
I am still doing them	Megale wo wɔm kokoko
Everything seemed so clear.	Edze abe nusianu me kɔ ale gbegbe ene.
Which brings me to my last point.	Nusi na meva ɖo nye nya mamlɛtɔ gbɔ.
I shouldn’t have been here anyway	Mele be mava afisia hafi le mɔ aɖeke nu o
I was too worried about myself to think about it.	Metsi dzi ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu akpa be mete ŋu bu eŋu o.
I came to question that one	Meva ke ɖi ɖeka ma
He wasn’t a man.	Menye ŋutsu aɖee o.
I just can’t talk to him right now	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aƒo nu kplii fifia o
He seemed very comfortable.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme ŋutɔ ene.
I couldn’t find enough of them to say	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ wo dometɔ si sɔ gbɔ be magblɔ o
I am not one of them	Menye wo dometɔ ɖekae menye o
It happened to me, too.	Edzɔ ɖe dzinye hã.
I really wanted to go	Medi vevie be mayi
They just didn’t have the money.	Ðeko ga la menɔ wo si o.
The money doesn’t seem real.	Edze abe ga la menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o ene.
I don’t know where you are	Nyemenya afi si nèle o
We don’t know any.	Míenya ɖeke o.
His face was hard.	Eƒe mo sesẽ.
A machine of your own making	Mɔ̃ aɖe si wò ŋutɔ nèwɔ
Not so many people.	Menye ame geɖe nenema gbegbe o.
Many informal people quit	Ame geɖe siwo mele ɖoɖo aɖeke me o la dzudzɔ
This is a nice place.	Teƒe nyui aɖee nye esi.
Go easy on your face.	Yi bɔbɔe le wò mo.
He was very attracted to her	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ
I have to be like that somehow	Ele be manɔ nenema le mɔ aɖe nu
Thereby, as.	To esia dzi la, abe.
But it did happen.	Gake edzɔ nyateƒe.
I think he will be pleased	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi nɛ
Not sure if it will be.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be anɔ nenema o.
I wondered if that was just as good	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe ema hã nyo nenema ke hã
He was such an incredible dog.	Enye avu si mexɔ se o ale gbegbe.
I can’t go out or do anything	Nyemate ŋu ado go alo awɔ naneke o
I must have been four	Anɔ eme be mexɔ ƒe ene hafi
I came across a way.	Meva ke ɖe mɔ aɖe ŋu.
He couldn’t help himself.	Mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe eɖokui nu o.
I married you last night	Meɖe wò le zã si va yi me

You killed that horse.	Wòe wu sɔ ma.
I am in control now	Nyee le dzi ɖum fifia
It was that reality for me.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ma nam.
I am very confident in it	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ
I wanted to try something different	Medi be mate nu bubu aɖe wɔwɔ kpɔ
And it isn’t either.	Eye mele nenema hã o.
It’s my opportunity.	Enye nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ.
I think it’s obviously obvious	Mesusu be edze ƒã be edze ƒã
I could hear his voice	Mete ŋu se eƒe gbe
I'll call him tonight.	Maƒo ka nɛ le zã sia me.
I want everything to be that simple	Medi be nusianu nanɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe
A few years later, he actually had one	Le ƒe ʋɛ aɖewo megbe la, ɖeka nɔ esi ŋutɔŋutɔ
Maybe there is no one.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖeke meli o.
There is always more.	Nu geɖe wu nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi.
I started doing this.	Medze esia wɔwɔ gɔme.
Quite a few of them actually	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔŋutɔ
I am in your hands’.	Nyee le asiwò’.
I have a big problem with that	Kuxi gã aɖe le ŋunye le ema ŋu
You can stay as long as you want.	Àte ŋu anɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi si nèdi.
I can see myself doing that.	Mete ŋu kpɔa ɖokuinye be mele nu ma wɔm.
He did great though.	Ewɔ nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ gake.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
And another one, too.	Eye ɖeka bubu hã.
Too soon to do anything.	Kaba akpa be woawɔ nane.
It could have made sense.	Susu ate ŋu anɔ eme hafi.
I couldn’t understand what it could be	Nyemete ŋu se nusi wòate ŋu anye gɔme o
This is appropriate.	Esia sɔ.
I know this process wasn’t happening before	Menya be ɖoɖo sia menɔ edzi yim tsã o
That was very exciting for me	Ema do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
This will be very helpful.	Esia akpe ɖe ame ŋu ŋutɔ.
I don’t want that at all.	Nyemedi be ema kura o.
Many of them are true	Wo dometɔ geɖe nye nyateƒe
I was hoping to save lives	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be maɖe amewo ƒe agbe ɖa
He did things.	Ewɔ nuwo.
He doesn’t know everyone yet.	Menya ame sia ame haɖe o.
I wanted so much at once	Medi nu geɖe ŋutɔ zi ɖeka
This thing is amazing.	Nu sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But no one is doing that.	Gake ame aɖeke mele ema wɔm o.
I know he has a good heart	Menya be dzi nyui le esi
But he can act on it.	Gake ate ŋu awɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu.
Think about this.	Bu nya sia ŋu kpɔ.
It could have been any age, from anywhere.	Ate ŋu anye ƒe ɖesiaɖe, tso teƒe ɖesiaɖe hafi.
I hope you don’t mind	Mele mɔ kpɔm be maɖe fu na wò o
I just wanted to get out of there	Ðeko medi be mado le afima
But there was some good news.	Gake nya nyui aɖewo nɔ eme.
There was nothing for me to do.	Naneke menɔ anyi nam be mawɔ o.
There is no other person.	Ame bubu aɖeke meli o.
Focus on that task, nothing else.	Lé fɔ ɖe dɔ ma ŋu, ke menye nu bubu aɖeke o.
Another problem arose.	Kuxi bubu aɖe hã do go.
I just hoped he was with them.	Ðeko menɔ mɔ kpɔm be ele wo gbɔ.
That’s a new thing.	Ema nye nu yeye.
It could be anyone.	Ate ŋu anye amesiame.
I wondered if he would come alone.	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe eya ɖeka azɔ ava hã.
I was very pleased with it	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
I saw a city there	Mekpɔ du aɖe le afima
But that’s something we can’t help you with.	Gake ema nye nusi míate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò le o.
Not so now.	Menye nenema fifia o.
I came to collect something	Meva be maƒo nane nu ƒu

It will never be the same.	Manɔ abe tsã ene gbeɖe o.

I became very angry.	Meva do dziku vevie.
I couldn’t help myself	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe ɖokuinye nu o
I wondered where we were	Mebia ɖokuinye be afikae míele hã
I’ve seen that name before.	Mekpɔ ŋkɔ ma kpɔ.
I was looking for the house	Menɔ aƒea dim
I have to go to work early	Ele be mayi dɔme kaba
This situation is different.	Nɔnɔme sia to vovo.

Go back to the main room.	Trɔ yi xɔ gã la gbɔ.
No one else was there.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afima o.
And the head of the mountain.	Le ta la to.
We don’t know what to do about it.	Míenya nusi míawɔ tso eŋu o.
The car is beautiful.	Ʋua nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
This is time is a waste.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi nye gbegblẽ.
We have that in my house.	Ema le mía si le nye aƒeme.
For himself.	Na eya ŋutɔ.
I was looking for a replacement	Menɔ ame si axɔ ɖe eteƒe dim
It never worked out.	Mewɔ dɔ gbeɖe o.
I can’t do that right now.	Nyemete ŋu le ema wɔm fifia o.
Not without me.	Menye nye manɔmee o.
There’s just one thing that doesn’t work.	Nu ɖeka koe li si mewɔa dɔ o.
Also, it’s a lot for one person.	Azɔ hã, enye nu geɖe na ame ɖeka.
Everything went well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie.

But he didn’t care.	Gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.

Anything you really want.	Nusianu si nèdi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Ultimately, it doesn’t matter.	Mlɔeba la, mehiã o.
I definitely remember hearing that.	Meɖo ŋku edzi godoo be mese nya ma.
I have heard so much about you.	Mese nu geɖe ŋutɔ tso ŋuwò.

It makes pretty obvious sense, you know.	Susu le eme si dze ƒã ŋutɔ, ènya.
I remember everything now	Meɖo ŋku nusianu dzi azɔ
I stood by the car.	Metsi tre ɖe ʋua gbɔ.
He has many years ahead of him.	Ƒe geɖe le ŋgɔ nɛ.
That came with the job for a lot of people.	Ema va kpe ɖe dɔa ŋu na ame geɖe.
He did the same thing.	Ewɔ nu ma ke.
I’m fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam.
I couldn’t do that	Nyemete ŋu wɔ ema o
I have never been so happy in my life	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ nenema gbegbe le nye agbe me kpɔ o
I wasn’t really sure what to do.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.

Now that’s just me.	Fifia nye koe nye ema.

And I needed to do it.	Eye ehiã be mawɔe.

I answered you angrily	Meɖo eŋu na wò kple dziku
I don’t know anything different.	Nyemenya naneke si to vovo na ema o.
I really can’t explain it	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu aɖe eme o
It is its own separate thing.	Enye eya ŋutɔ ƒe nu si le eɖokui si.
I couldn’t take it all in	Nyemete ŋu xɔ wo katã ɖe eme o
In fact, he was the only one.	Le nyateƒe me la, eya ɖeka koe nye ema.
I can’t go there myself and I don’t want to.	Nye ŋutɔ nyemate ŋu ayi afima o eye nyemedi hã o.
I couldn’t deny him that joy	Nyemate ŋu agbe dzidzɔ ma nɛ o
A difficult thing he had just worked on himself	Nu sesẽ aɖe si eya ŋutɔ wɔ dɔ le teti koe nye ema
You have to do something with it.	Ele be nàwɔ nane kplii.
Or very, very little.	Alo nu sue aɖe ŋutɔ, nu sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can’t do my part without your help	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nye akpa dzi wò kpekpeɖeŋu manɔmee o
There is no such obvious possibility here.	Nusi ate ŋu adzɔ si dze ƒã alea mele afisia o.
He couldn’t speak.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu o.
He seemed surprised.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ ene.

I need to know what it looks like	Ele be manya ale si wòle
Maybe towards the back of the whole mansion.	Ðewohĩ aɖo ta xɔ gã bliboa ƒe megbe.

It's going on there.	Ele edzi yim le afima.
I couldn’t bear to take it all off	Nyemete ŋu do dzi be maɖe wo katã ɖa o
Some of them worked very well.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo wɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
We know he is with you.	Míenya be ele kpli wò.
Or is too much.	Alo nye nu geɖe akpa.
However, it doesn’t seem to work.	Ke hã, edze abe mewɔa dɔ o ene.
I’ve never seen you like this	Nyemekpɔ wò alea kpɔ o
I can work with this	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ kple esia
I can’t save you from that	Nyemate ŋu aɖe wò tso ema me o
I deserve to be happy	Medze be makpɔ dzidzɔ
But it is one that can help many.	Gake enye esi ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame geɖe ŋu.
I can do something	Mate ŋu awɔ nane
Not while watching them from a house.	Menye esime wònɔ wo kpɔm tso aƒe aɖe me o.
I'll just say that.	Ðeko magblɔ nya ma.
The plaintiff did not come on his own.	Ame si tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu la meva le eɖokui si o.
I’ve been here before.	Meva afisia kpɔ.
Not surprising, really.	Mewɔ nuku o, le nyateƒe me.
A few weeks later would have been better	Kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo megbe la, anyo wu hafi
It was really interesting and I brought something else here	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ eye metsɔ nu bubu aɖe va afisia
I couldn’t help him much	Nyemete ŋu kpe ɖe eŋu boo o
Start your own money.	Dze wò ŋutɔ wò ga gɔme.
Bring plenty of food and water.	Tsɔ nuɖuɖu kple tsi geɖe ɖe asi.
I was the only guy there	Nye ɖeka koe nye ŋutsu si nɔ afima
This seemed to surprise them.	Edze abe esia wɔ nuku na wo ene.
That took almost a month.	Ema xɔ ɣleti ɖeka kloe.
Two people returned.	Ame eve trɔ gbɔ.
I used to have no free time.	Vovo menɔ ŋunye tsã o.
Not in my lifetime.	Menye le nye agbe me o.
Someone broke into our house.	Ame aɖe ge ɖe míaƒe aƒea me.
I liked this guy.	Ŋutsu sia dze ŋunye.
My work is that good.	Nye dɔa nyo nenema.
I wonder where he is now	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be afikae wòle fifia hã
But come on inside.	Gake va ge ɖe eme.
I gave them permission.	Meɖe mɔ na wo.
Write down where you are.	Ŋlɔ afi si nèle la ɖi.
No one was talking about this before.	Ame aɖeke menɔ nu ƒom tso nya sia ŋu kpɔ o.
Maybe I can do it.	Ðewohĩ mate ŋui.
I didn’t feel attracted to anyone.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be ame aɖeke ƒe nu lé dzi nam o.
I could be doing that myself at home	Nye ŋutɔ mate ŋu anɔ ema wɔm le aƒeme
I don’t think anyone would do that to anyone	Nyemesusu be ame aɖeke awɔ nu ma na ame aɖe o
It will be good for us.	Anyo na mí.
I was more surprised than anyone	Ewɔ nuku nam wu ame sia ame
It would be better this way.	Anyo wu le mɔ sia nu.
In fact, many of them.	Le nyateƒe me la, wo dometɔ geɖe.
But he deserved it.	Gake edze nɛ.
People would say it was a nice house.	Amewo agblɔ be aƒe nyui aɖee.
I felt old enough to travel alone	Mese le ɖokuinye me be metsi ale gbegbe be nye ɖeka mate ŋu azɔ mɔ
I promise you.	Medo ŋugbe na wò.
I can’t do anything about it	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso eŋu o
I struggled with myself	Mewɔ avu kple ɖokuinye
You can’t call him.	Màte ŋu aƒo ka nɛ o.
He didn’t want them done.	Medi be woawɔ wo o.
I think that needs some work.	Mesusu be ema hiã dɔ aɖewo wɔwɔ.
Who.	Ame ka.
But its the way it is.	Gake eƒe alesi wòle.
I have to tell you the same thing.	Ele be magblɔ nya ma ke na mi.
I know this seems hard for you	Menya be esia dze nu sesẽ na wò
I have a lot to do tomorrow	Nu geɖe le asinye mawɔ etsɔ
I have my own job.	Nye ŋutɔ nye dɔ le asinye.
I was furious at that point	Medo dziku vevie le ɣeyiɣi ma me
I already told them that a long time ago	Megblɔ nya ma na wo xoxo ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia
It’s just the age of people.	Ƒe si amewo xɔ koe nye ema.
The issue is very important.	Nya la le vevie ŋutɔ.
You killed my life.	Wòe wu nye agbe.
It’s old, but it will work.	Enye xoxo, gake awɔ dɔ.
I can’t say exactly what it is	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi tututu wònye o
Now get rid of this.	Azɔ ɖe esia ɖa.
Or maybe for some.	Alo ɖewohĩ na ame aɖewo.
I can’t tell you anything more	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke na wò wu ema o
I think this could be what we’re looking for	Mesusu be esia ate ŋu anye nusi dim míele
You never had the idea.	Susu la menɔ asiwò kpɔ o.
I can get the money, no problem.	Mate ŋu axɔ ga la, kuxi aɖeke mele eme o.
There were several possible reasons for this.	Susu geɖe nɔ anyi siwo ate ŋu anɔ esia ta.
I never saw myself as a good person	Nyemekpɔ ɖokuinye abe ame nyui ene kpɔ o
I am new to this.	Nyee nye ame yeye le esia me.
I was alone among myself	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye dome
I want to spend all day with my little dog	Medi be manɔ nye avu sue la gbɔ ŋkeke bliboa
Nothing like that matters.	Naneke si le abe ema ene mehiã o.
It wasn’t anything at all.	Menye naneke kura o.
Something had to be done.	Ele be woawɔ nane.
I want the same thing.	Nye hã medi nenema.
I think he’s in bad shape	Mesusu be eƒe nɔnɔme gblẽ
I couldn’t understand it.	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme o.
I was just so sick.	Ðeko medze dɔ ale gbegbe.
I think he’s really cute	Mesusu be eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
I think this is a bad idea	Mesusu be esia nye susu gbegblẽ aɖe
They were so excited.	Dzi dzɔ wo ale gbegbe.
Everything adds up in time.	Nusianu ƒoa ƒu ɖe ɣeyiɣi dzi.
Not for months.	Menye ɣleti geɖe o.
In fact, it looks pretty good today.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze nyuie ŋutɔ egbea.
And she can’t have a man.	Eye mate ŋu akpɔ ŋutsu aɖeke o.
Everybody that comes here, everybody wants the same thing.	Ame sia ame si va afisia la, ame sia ame di nu ɖeka ma ke.
That should have been strictly enforced.	Ðe wòle be woawɔ ɖe ema dzi vevie hafi.
Now, do that.	Azɔ, wɔe nenema.
Same job, same food.	Dɔ ɖeka ma ke, nuɖuɖu ɖeka ma ke.
I was there myself	Nye ŋutɔ menɔ afima
He never stayed with them.	Metsi wo gbɔ kpɔ o.
This was a big deal for him.	Esia nye nya gã aɖe nɛ.
I can’t let go of another.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le bubu ŋu o.
I should have said he already had one	Ðe wòle be magblɔ be ɖeka le esi xoxo hafi
A man should do what a man should do.	Ele be ŋutsu nawɔ nusi wòle be ŋutsu nawɔ.
I just wanted something simple	Ðeko medi nane si le bɔbɔe
I have time on my hands.	Ɣeyiɣi le asinye.
He just made a mistake.	Ðeko wòwɔ vodada.
He is doing well.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie.
Not in my name.	Menye le nye ŋkɔ me o.
I felt so thin.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye lãme ƒu ale gbegbe.
But there are a few problems with this.	Gake kuxi ʋɛ aɖewo le esia ŋu.
. . . .	.
Shortly thereafter, he did the same.	Ema megbe kpuie la, ewɔ nenema ke.
Which is very surprising.	Nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It might be a bad thing.	Ðewohĩ anye nu gbegblẽ.
I should have tried that.	Ðe wòle be mate ema kpɔ hafi.
A real first-school idea	Suku gbãtɔ ƒe susu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe
If there are any mistakes, print them.	Ne vodada aɖewo li la, ta wo.
I think we have a lot in common.	Mesusu be nu geɖe le mía dome siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
This made sense, and it worked well.	Susu nɔ esia me, eye wòwɔ dɔ nyuie.
The day before.	Ŋkeke si do ŋgɔ.
Your work is still valuable.	Wò dɔa gakpɔtɔ xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I explained it to him earlier	Meɖe eme nɛ do ŋgɔ
It certainly won’t come.	Mava godoo o.
A little at a time, of course	Vi aɖe le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me ya
I want to go to school	Medi be mayi suku
I knew he was probably tired	Menya be ɖewohĩ ɖeɖi te eŋu
I felt like I was just going to be there	Mese le ɖokuinye me be afima koe manɔ
Hours must have passed.	Anɔ eme be gaƒoƒo geɖe va yi.
You can’t answer it.	Màte ŋu aɖo eŋu o.
I want him to fight now	Medi be wòawɔ avu fifia
A man entered the room	Ŋutsu aɖe ge ɖe xɔa me
Opportunity is another factor.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ hã nye nu bubu.
I can’t be there anymore	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afima azɔ o
A few cars here and there	Ʋu ʋɛ aɖewo le afisia kple afima
I want to work.	Medi be mawɔ dɔ.
We have some people working on it.	Ame aɖewo le mía si le dɔ wɔm tso eŋu.
I just felt so small	Ðeko mese le ɖokuinye me be mele sue ŋutɔ
It was just wrong for me.	Ðeko wònye nu gbegblẽ nam.
I also know who did it to you	Menya ame si wɔe ɖe ŋuwò hã
This really helped to organize everything down to the last detail.	Esia kpe ɖe eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ be woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe nusianu ŋu vaseɖe nu mamlɛtɔ dzi.
I hope you can save it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu aɖee
And we really don’t know much about it yet.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, míenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu haɖe o.
I want to do this for you	Medi be mawɔ esia na mi
I have to stay with them	Ele be manɔ wo gbɔ
It didn’t last long.	Menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
I also need to talk to them	Ele be maƒo nu kpli wo hã
I couldn’t work it out	Nyemete ŋu wɔ dɔ le eŋu o
I looked away from him	Meɖe mo ɖa le eŋu
This is what happened.	Esia va eme.
I only got four.	Ene koe mexɔ.
I can control it better	Mate ŋu aɖu edzi nyuie wu
I work a little bit	Mewɔa dɔ vie
Not a little truth in that.	Menye nyateƒe vi aɖe le nya ma me o.
He went ahead himself.	Eya ŋutɔ yi ŋgɔ.
I needed to be in charge	Ehiã be manɔ dɔa dzi kpɔm
He must be responsible.	Ele be wòawɔ nu ɖe ​​nu ŋu nyuie.
I asked a lot of questions	Mebia nya geɖe
Look at where you are.	Kpɔ afisi nèle ɖa.
Hold it down.	Lé edzi ɖe anyi.
This may be the case for you.	Esia ate ŋu anɔ alea na wò hã.
It was just a small hole.	Do sue aɖe koe wònye.
But there will never be a reason.	Gake susu aɖeke manɔ anyi gbeɖe o.
I needed to know what he wanted	Ehiã be manya nu si dim wòle
I could stay there for hours	Mete ŋu nɔa afima gaƒoƒo geɖe
There are a few people there.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo le afima.
Do whatever you have to do.	Wɔ nusianu si wòle be nàwɔ.
I was surprised when he didn’t	Ewɔ nuku nam esi mewɔe nenema o
And we have nothing.	Eye naneke mele mía si o.
We live in one.	Míele agbe le ɖeka me.
He will seek you and you alone.	Adi wò eye wò ɖeka koe.
I did some work on this.	Mewɔ dɔ aɖewo le esia ŋu.
I’m not going to tell him that	Nyemele nya ma gblɔ ge nɛ o
I was very impressed with him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I knew that would go away.	Menya be ema nu ayi.
When you eat, eat.	Ne èle nu ɖum la, ɖu nu.
Live by it.	Nɔ agbe ɖe enu.
I’m not quite sure	Nyemeka ɖe edzi tututu o
I have met some nice people.	Medo go ame nyui aɖewo kpɔ.
I promise I will do the same	Medo ŋugbe be mawɔ nenema ke
Every one of them is good for me.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe nyo nam.
You and no one else.	Wò kple ame bubu aɖeke o.
I was already running	Menɔ du dzi xoxo
There is no room for that.	Teƒe aɖeke meli na ema o.
I did that very quickly.	Mewɔe nenema kaba ŋutɔ.
I just never had a real person	Ðeko ame ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke menɔ asinye kpɔ o
This is going to be bad.	Esia le gbegblẽ ge.
You can see everything, you can feel everything.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusianu, àte ŋu ase nusianu gɔme.
An idea came to him.	Susu aɖe va susu me nɛ.
I should have known it wouldn’t have been	Ðe wòle be manya be manɔ nenema hafi o
There are actually quite a few possibilities.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ li siwo ate ŋu adzɔ.
And honestly, that’s as good a name as any.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ŋkɔ nyui aɖee nye ema abe ŋkɔ ɖesiaɖe ene.
It will not be real as it is.	Manɔ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ abe alesi wòle ene o.
I want you to do exactly what you want	Medi be nàwɔ nu si tututu nèdi
I guess that’s not so surprising	Mesusu be ema mewɔ nuku nenema gbegbe o
However, he never had money.	Ke hã, ga menɔ esi kpɔ o.
I don’t know about that	Nyemenya nu tso nya ma ŋu o
Not everything though, really	Menye nusianu gake, le nyateƒe me
Please clean it once a week.	Taflatse kɔ eŋu zi ɖeka le kwasiɖa me.
That can do it.	Ema ate ŋu awɔe.
But of course he wouldn’t.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mawɔe nenema o.
I remember parts of it	Meɖo ŋku eƒe akpa aɖewo dzi
As long as it doesn’t cost us much.	Zi alesi mexɔ asi boo aɖeke na mí o ko.
I'm pretty sure there are only two	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ be eve koe li
I did great, actually.	Mewɔ nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
I want to know why you did this	Medi be manya nu si tae nèwɔ esia ɖo
I hope you like it!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò!.
I couldn’t leave, not yet	Nyemete ŋu dzo o, menye haɖe o
I don’t think he needs to do that.	Nyemesusu be mehiã be wòawɔ ema o.
And many other factors.	Eye nu bubu geɖe hã kpe ɖe eŋu.
I can’t do anything on my own	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke le ɖokuinye si o
I asked the exact same question	Mebia nya ma ke tututu
It’s in your face.	Ele wò mo.
I don’t know who he is	Nyemenya amesi wònye o
I wondered what was wrong	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae gblẽ hã
It is also too simplistic.	Enye nusi le bɔbɔe akpa hã.
I needed another strategy	Mehiã aɖaŋu bubu aɖe
I see you have a problem.	Mekpɔ be kuxi aɖe le ŋuwò.
I want to tell you everything that is in my heart.	Medi be magblɔ nu sia nu si le nye dzi me la na mi.
I have been waiting for a very long time	Mele lalam ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ
This time, it was the last.	Fifia ya, enye mamlɛtɔ.

He can’t walk tomorrow.	Mate ŋu azɔ etsɔ o.
Check that out right there.	Kpɔ ema ɖa le afima tututu.
I liked that about them	Ema dzɔ dzi nam le wo ŋu
He had enough of it.	Eƒe nu sɔ gbɔ nɛ.
Or maybe this is out of order.	Alo ɖewohĩ esia to vovo na ɖoɖo aɖe.
After this, not really.	Le esia megbe la, menye nenema tututu o.
He doesn’t do this very often.	Mewɔa esia zi geɖe o.
I can protect my people	Mate ŋu akpɔ nye amewo ta
You don’t have any food.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke mele asiwò o.
But there was no clear plan.	Gake ɖoɖo aɖeke menɔ anyi si me kɔ o.
It’s a new thing.	Enye nu yeye aɖe.

I remember that day like it was yesterday	Meɖo ŋku ŋkeke ma dzi abe etsɔ ene
I have to live through two more days	Ele be manɔ agbe to ŋkeke eve bubu me
Everywhere in the room seemed to be on fire.	Edze abe dzo le xɔa me ƒe teƒe ɖesiaɖe ene.
I can’t see a problem with it.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ kuxi le eme o.
I can’t really seem to play this role	Edze abe nyemate ŋu awɔ akpa sia ŋutɔŋutɔ o ene
Needs a hand.	Hiã na asi.

I wasn’t sure what to say at the meeting	Nyemeka ɖe nya si magblɔ le kpekpea me dzi o
I wouldn’t have had the money to do it	Anye ne ga la manɔ asinye be mawɔ o
You can see them.	Àte ŋu akpɔ wo.
I started early yesterday.	Medze egɔme kaba etsɔ.
By itself, it’s nothing.	Le eɖokui si la, menye naneke o.
I had to do a few things	Ele be mawɔ nu ʋɛ aɖewo
As if it were the case.	Abe ɖe wòle nenema ene.
I don’t know his name	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ o
Months later, he escaped	Le ɣleti geɖe megbe la, esi
I don’t want to talk about this	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso nya sia ŋu o
I don’t think it really matters	Mesusu be mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o
There is only one other thing.	Nu bubu ɖeka koe li.
I am a good person. 	Ame nyui aɖee menye.

I thought everything would be better	Mesusu be nusianu anyo wu
I think he felt the same way	Mesusu be eya hã se le eɖokui me nenema ke
I looked around the room, a little annoyed	Mekpɔ xɔa me godoo, eye medo dziku vie

I am so worried about you	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò ale gbegbe
But it doesn’t matter, really.	Gake mehiã o, le nyateƒe me.
I couldn’t think of anything else	Nyemete ŋu bu nya bubu aɖeke ŋu o
I settled in, relaxed and comfortable	Meva nɔ eme, eye meɖe dzi ɖi eye nye dzi dze eme
But it’s not because of him.	Gake menye eya tae o.

And so many voices at the same time.	Eye gbe geɖe ŋutɔ le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
Alone, go in, pray.	Wò ɖeka, ge ɖe eme, do gbe ɖa.
You can help people find a good car.	Àte ŋu akpe ɖe amewo ŋu le ʋu nyui didi me.

Everyone was too excited.	Dzi dzɔ amesiame akpa.

He is there now.	Ele afima fifia.

I tried to be verbal	Medze agbagba be mawɔ nu kple nu

But he submitted too many skills	Gake etsɔ aɖaŋu geɖe akpa ɖo ɖa

In fact, over and over again.	Le nyateƒe me la, zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I can’t do much more.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe wu o.
I honestly don’t know that	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nya ma o
He didn’t allow for anything.	Meɖe mɔ ɖe nu ŋu o.
It may not be the case.	Ðewohĩ manɔ nenema o.
It will end the same way.	Awu enu nenema ke.
I defied popular opinion	Metsi tre ɖe amewo ƒe susu ŋu
I don’t think he’ll remember me	Nyemesusu be aɖo ŋku dzinye o
And that’s about it.	Eye esia ku ɖe eŋu.
Do something about it.	Wɔ nane tso eŋu.
It was his own mistake.	Enye vodada si eya ŋutɔ wɔ.
But think about this.	Gake bu esia ŋu kpɔ.
Good afternoon, everyone.	Ŋdɔ nyui na mi, amesiame.

You also have to have a voice.	Ele be gbe hã nanɔ asiwò.

That was, like, what he was working on.	Emae nye, abe, nusi ŋu wònɔ dɔ wɔm le ene.

I just really needed the money	Ðeko mehiã ga la ŋutɔŋutɔ
I am the opposite.	Nyee nye nusi to vovo na ema.
Actually, I think my.	Le nyateƒe me la, mesusu be nye...
I didn’t really have anything	Naneke menɔ asinye ŋutɔŋutɔ o
And he didn’t either.	Eye eya hã mewɔe nenema o.
I don't know what happened to him.	Nyemenya nusi va dzɔ ɖe edzi o.
I didn’t have it that morning	Menɔ asinye ŋdi ma o
No one is sure and few will speak up.	Ame aɖeke meka ɖe edzi o eye ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe aƒo nu.
I couldn’t remember anything	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku naneke dzi o
I can still almost see us there	Mete ŋu kpɔa mí le afima kloe kokoko
I knew there would be none	Menya be ɖeke manɔ anyi o
It didn’t bother me at all	Meɖe fu nam kura o
I want no part of this.	Medi be esia ƒe akpa aɖeke mele o.
I can barely remember	Ƒã hafi mate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi
It seems like a long time ago	Edze abe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe va yi ene
I'll come and get you	Mava xɔ wò
I could have kept going.	Anye ne mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim hafi.
This is not a new idea.	Esia menye susu yeye o.
He could never prove them	Mete ŋu ɖo kpe wo dzi gbeɖe o
That happened to me a few times.	Ema dzɔ ɖe dzinye zi ʋɛ aɖewo.
I was really sick.	Medze dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He had nothing to offer.	Naneke menɔ esi o.
But we are not backing down.	Gake míele megbe yim o.
Everything happened to him.	Nusianu dzɔ ɖe edzi.
I barely heard from him that year.	Ƒã hafi mese eƒe nya le ƒe ma me o.
That is impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
It’s not a place you want to be.	Menye teƒe si nèdi be yeanɔ ye o.
I needed some space between him and me	Ehiã be makpɔ teƒe aɖe le mía kplii dome
I think we know that	Mesusu be míenya esia
I can’t seem to take it all in	Edze abe nyemate ŋu axɔ wo katã ɖe eme o ene
But the whole place is very small.	Gake teƒe bliboa le sue ŋutɔ.
I knew this place wasn’t for him	Menya be teƒe sia menye eya tɔ o
The loss of blood was shocking.	Ʋu si bu la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It won’t be easy.	Manɔ bɔbɔe o.
I can’t imagine anyone there.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ame aɖeke le afima le susu me o.
It could be him.	Ate ŋu anye eya.
Which is the truth.	Nusi nye nyateƒe.
I am testing everything with fire	Mele nusianu dom kpɔ kple dzo
I trust him in my life	Meka ɖe edzi le nye agbe me
There really is very little you can do.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu sue aɖe koe li nàwɔ.
I didn’t see anyone else there	Nyemekpɔ ame bubu aɖeke le afima o
I didn’t see his car.	Nyemekpɔ eƒe ʋua o.
Was no one too happy about it.	Ðe ame aɖeke mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu akpa oa.
In fact, few people do.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔa esia.
There were several dogs in each.	Avu geɖe nɔ wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe me.
I think it’s in everyone	Mesusu be ele amesiame me
I don’t think he’ll be calling me	Nyemesusu be anɔ ka ƒom nam o
I could never hope to be like that	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ mɔ gbeɖe be manɔ nenema o
If not, leave them out.	Ne menye nenema o la, ke gblẽ wo ɖi.
I looked past them.	Mekpɔ nu to wo ŋu.
I can’t remember when	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku ɣekaɣie dzi o
That was probably the hardest part of my job.	Ðewohĩ emae nye nye dɔa ƒe akpa si sesẽ wu.
Touch something solid, real.	Ka asi nu sesẽ aɖe, nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋu.
Shortly thereafter, he lost consciousness.	Ema megbe kpuie la, eƒe lãme bu.
Compare this to it.	Tsɔ esia sɔ ɖe enu.
I want you to say my name.	Medi be nàgblɔ nye ŋkɔ.
I was very happy for once.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ zi ɖeka.
I can find another job there	Mate ŋu akpɔ dɔ bubu le afima
Think about what you want, not what you don’t want.	Bu nu si nèdi ŋu, ke menye nu si mèdi o la ŋu o.
I, myself, have had enough	Nye, nye ŋutɔ, mekpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ
I think that’s why he has no teeth	Mesusu be esia tae aɖu aɖeke mele esi o ɖo
I’ve never been able to talk to him about it	Nyemete ŋu ƒo nu tso eŋu nɛ kpɔ o
I definitely pissed him off	Medo dziku nɛ godoo
I know some very good times	Menya ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖewo ŋutɔ
I will be alone.	Nye ɖeka manɔ anyi.
I don’t want to know	Nyemedi be manya o
I just want to tell you something very important	Ðeko medi be magblɔ nya aɖe si le vevie ŋutɔ na mi
He was a strange little man.	Enye ŋutsu sue aɖe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I think it’s, like, a big deal	Mesusu be enye, abe, nya gã aɖe ene
Our thoughts are on you.	Míaƒe susu le ŋuwò.
That’s very clear.	Ema me kɔ ŋutɔ.
I only asked for two things	Nu eve koe mebia
No one will do our work for us	Ame aɖeke mawɔ míaƒe dɔ na mí o
You just can’t do it.	Ðeko màte ŋui o.
Some might say this came too easily.	Ame aɖewo agblɔ be esia va bɔbɔe akpa.
I would love to do that!.	Adzɔ dzi nam be mawɔ ema!.
I have always been able to take good care of myself.	Mete ŋu kpɔa ɖokuinye dzi nyuie ɣesiaɣi.
What is the de.	Nukae nye de.
I might be wrong though.	Ðewohĩ mawɔ vodada gake.
He had no desire to do anything more.	Didi aɖeke menɔ eme be yeawɔ naneke wu ema o.
I want to know what happened to him.	Medi be manya nu si dzɔ ɖe edzi.
I can’t get it out of my mind	Nyemate ŋu aɖee le nye susu me o
I found out about the building	Meva nya nu tso xɔa ŋu
I wasn’t happy about that though	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe ema ŋu ya o
I need to get out more	Ele be mado go geɖe wu
I think everything you did was right	Mesusu be nusianu si nèwɔ la sɔ
That’s a slightly more complicated situation.	Ema nye nɔnɔme si sesẽ wu vie.
Perhaps you can explain this to him.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu aɖe nya sia me nɛ.
I heard them clearly.	Mese wo nyuie.
This is very easy to do.	Esia wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
You’re not like that either.	Wò hã mèle nenema o.
Hard.	Sesẽ.
I wonder what he hopes to see through it	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae wòle mɔ kpɔm be yeakpɔ to eme hã
But promise me something.	Gake do nane ƒe ŋugbe nam.
Only if something goes wrong.	Ne nane gblẽ ko hafi.
This appeals to you.	Esia dzɔa dzi na wò.
I guess not so long ago	Mesusu be menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia o
Yet no one does this.	Ke hã ame aɖeke mewɔa esia o.
I was amazed at how easy it was	Ale si gbegbe wònɔ bɔbɔe la wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
I asked for help	Mebia kpekpeɖeŋu
Mine worked so well.	Nye tɔ wɔ dɔ nyuie ale gbegbe.
I got better stuff at a better price with them	Mexɔ nu siwo nyo wu le asi si nyo wu dzi kpli wo
He never did anything for you.	Mewɔ naneke na wò kpɔ o.
I should have found it already	Ðe wòle be meke ɖe eŋu xoxo hafi
I am very interested in you	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò ŋutɔ
Maybe he couldn’t express what was in his heart.	Ðewohĩ mete ŋu gblɔ nya si nɔ eƒe dzi me o.
You can work.	Àte ŋu awɔ dɔ.
I had to tell them what happened	Ele be magblɔ nusi dzɔ la na wo
I don’t want him anywhere near me	Nyemedi be wòate ɖe ŋunye le afi aɖeke o
Maybe it will help.	Ðewohĩ akpe ɖe ame ŋu.
Everything he couldn’t say.	Nusianu si mete ŋu gblɔ o.
A person is an idea in the mind	Ame nye susu aɖe si le susu me
I have some other things too	Nu bubu aɖewo hã le asinye
Not too late, not too soon.	Menye megbe akpa o, menye kaba akpa o.
I'll take care of it from here.	Makpɔ edzi tso afisia.
If not more than that.	Ne menye esi wu nenema o la.
He never came.	Meva kpɔ o.
However, a few are still missing.	Ke hã, wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ bu.
He was the best fit.	Enye amesi sɔ nyuie wu.
I told him all about it	Megblɔ nya sia katã nɛ
I really like these things	Nu siawo dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
A little bit for us.	Vi aɖe na mí.
The reasons why.	Susu siwo tae.
Today there was a lot.	Egbea nu geɖe nɔ anyi.
We don’t have anything.	Naneke mele mía si o.
I carried a stone face.	Metsɔ kpe ƒe mo ɖe asi.
That thing is amazing.	Nu ma wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Money can be fun.	Ga ate ŋu ado dzidzɔ na ame.
He wasn’t ready for this.	Menɔ klalo na esia o.
In the meantime.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la.
This will not work.	Esia mawɔ dɔ o.
But it’s not bothering him.	Gake menye ɖe wòle fu ɖem nɛ o.
I had to come and find it	Ele be mava ke ɖe eŋu
Often, over and over again.	Zi geɖe la, zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
This was important to him.	Esia nɔ vevie nɛ.
I wish we could do that today	Ne ɖe míate ŋu awɔ ema egbea la, anye ne mewɔe nenema gbegbe
It won’t be easy, but it’s totally possible.	Manɔ bɔbɔe o, gake anya wɔ kura.
I'll explain it to him	Maɖe eme nɛ
I enjoy doing this for everyone	Esia wɔwɔ na amesiame doa dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
I don’t want to meet anyone	Nyemedi be mado go ame aɖeke o
I was personally very impressed	Nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
I think that’s good for them	Mesusu be ema nyo na wo
I would have loved to see that	Anye ne madi vevie be makpɔ ema hafi
He liked his house very much.	Eƒe aƒea dze eŋu ŋutɔ.
I think it will take you months	Mesusu be axɔ ɣleti geɖe na wò
I was going through it	Menɔ eme tom
It’s not like it used to be.	Menye abe alesi wònɔ tsã ene o.
There is nothing like it.	Naneke meli si sɔ kplii o.
But there are times.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖewo li.
I don't know why he did that.	Nyemenya nu si tae wòwɔ nu ma ɖo o.
I never understood another	Nyemese bubu gɔme kpɔ o
This can’t end so easily.	Esia mate ŋu awu enu bɔbɔe nenema o.
And my name is.	Eye nye ŋkɔ.
We can say what we like.	Míate ŋu agblɔ nya si dze mía ŋu.
I think there was one small one.	Mesusu be sue ɖeka nɔ anyi.
I know how you like them	Menya alesi wo dzɔa dzi na wò
Very interesting city.	Du si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
I can’t handle this	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ o
That appeals to me	Ema dzɔa dzi nam
We can’t tell.	Míate ŋu anya o.
I didn’t really know what to expect.	Nyemenya nusi makpɔ mɔ na ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I needed to tell him the truth	Ehiã be magblɔ nyateƒea nɛ
At this point, there was a lot to do.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, nu geɖe nɔ anyi woawɔ.
I can’t talk to anyone else right now.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu kple ame bubu aɖeke fifia o.
The work he did was amazing.	Dɔ si wòwɔ la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Obviously, it won’t work for everyone.	Edze ƒã be mawɔ dɔ na amesiame o.
But we have a few rules here.	Gake se ʋɛ aɖewo le mía si le afisia.
Which contains a device.	Si me mɔ̃ aɖe le.
I didn’t mean to upset him	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mado dziku nɛ o
It’s either there or it’s not there.	Ele afima alo mele afima o.
I just can’t stand here	Ðeko nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe afisia o
Describe your project.	Gblɔ wò dɔa.
I’m not doing anything illegal.	Nyemele naneke wɔm si mele se nu o.
Great is great.	Gã nye gã.
An hour has passed	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka va yi
I will do much good there	Mawɔ nyui geɖe le afima
I knew absolutely nothing about it	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu kura o
Things are still very difficult.	Nuwo gakpɔtɔ sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Something completely different.	Nane si to vovo kura.
Every year we have to do the same thing.	Ƒe sia ƒe la, ele be míawɔ nu ɖeka ma ke.
This makes a lot of sense.	Susu le nya sia me ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t stop thinking about you	Nyemete ŋu dzudzɔ wò ŋu bubu o
It’s just the truth.	Nyateƒea koe.
And not just any reason.	Eye menye susu ɖesiaɖe ko o.
There are too many of them for the police to control.	Wo dometɔ geɖe sɔ gbɔ akpa be kpovitɔwo mate ŋu aɖu wo dzi o.
It’s only been a week.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka koe nye esia.
You don’t want to do that.	Mèdi be yeawɔ nu ma o.
I'm pretty sure there's nothing wrong with either of us	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ be naneke mele mía dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o
Do one, a few, or all of them.	Wɔ wo dometɔ ɖeka, ʋɛ aɖewo, alo wo katã.
I can’t say that to myself	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma na ɖokuinye o
There are many problems with this system.	Kuxi geɖe le ɖoɖo sia ŋu.
He couldn’t deny her anything.	Mete ŋu gbe naneke nɛ o.
It was a beautiful summer day.	Dzomeŋɔli ƒe ŋkeke nyui aɖee wònye.
I never wanted a big house.	Nyemedi aƒe gã aɖeke kpɔ o.
I don’t want to go without him	Nyemedi be mayi eya manɔmee o
I promise you, we can	Medo ŋugbe na wò be, míate ŋui
He had never seen them.	Mekpɔ wo kpɔ o.
No one heard a word.	Ame aɖeke mese nya aɖeke o.
I was in this room, and I shouldn’t have been	Menɔ xɔ sia me, eye mele be manɔ nenema hafi o
His first job is here.	Eƒe dɔ gbãtɔ le afisia.
I think he would like to see you	Mesusu be adi be yeakpɔ wò
He needs us now more than ever.	Ehiã mí fifia wu tsã.
I believe in it strongly	Mexɔ edzi se vevie
But things were suddenly looking up.	Gake nuwo nɔ dzi yim zi ɖeka.
This time is an exception.	Ɣeyiɣi sia nye esi to vovo.
Just like it used to be.	Abe alesi wònɔ tsã ene.
I don’t want them now	Nyemedi wo fifia o
None of these things are true.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
I couldn’t have done it faster	Nyemate ŋu awɔe kaba wu ema o
There is nothing quite like it.	Naneke meli si sɔ kple esia tututu o.
None of us could answer them.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mete ŋu ɖo eŋu na wo o.
From now on, he will have nothing of his own.	Tso fifia dzi la, eya ŋutɔ ƒe naneke manɔ esi o.
That annoyed me.	Ema do dziku nam.
The same error arose.	Vodada ma ke hã fɔ ɖe te.
Thank you for breakfast.	Akpe na mi ɖe ŋdi nuɖuɖu ta.
My first home.	Nye aƒe gbãtɔ.
I'll go with you if you don't mind.	Mayi kpli wò ne meɖe fu na wò o.
Everyone here is dead.	Ame sia ame si le afi sia la ku.
I know what this is about.	Menya nusi ŋu nya sia ku ɖo.
Death is too easy.	Ku le bɔbɔe akpa.
It was like he was someone else.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ame bubu aɖee wònye ene.
I did, a lot.	Mewɔe, geɖe ŋutɔ.
It will be very easy.	Anɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
This is obvious.	Esia dze ƒã.
Leave them here.	Gblẽ wo ɖi le afisia.
I will come and sit with you	Mava nɔ anyi kpli wò
I think you might have said something to him	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ègblɔ nya aɖe nɛ hafi
Ava couldn't help herself.	Ava mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe eɖokui nu o.
I’ll do something for you	Mawɔ nane na wò
I like that about them	Ema dzɔa dzi nam le wo ŋu
I will be there for you	Manɔ afima na wò
But there is still a trap.	Gake mɔ̃ aɖe gakpɔtɔ li.
In fact, it could have been any of us	Le nyateƒe me la, ate ŋu anye mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe hafi
I didn’t get a good look at his face.	Nyemekpɔ eƒe mo nyuie o.
I want to do it so many times	Medi be mawɔe zi geɖe ale gbegbe
But I had to go.	Gake ele nam be mayi.
I'm seeing what we can do	Mele nu si míate ŋu awɔ la kpɔm
I thought something must be wrong	Mesusu be nane anya gblẽ le eŋu
I had no idea it would come	Nyemenya kura be ava o
I want to know what year his head is.	Medi be manya ƒe si me eƒe ta le.
I can’t really explain it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I have a challenge for all of you here today	Kuxi aɖe le asinye na mi katã le afisia egbea
Think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ.
I have to go home for a bit	Ele be mayi aƒeme vie
The project seems impossible today.	Edze abe dɔa mate ŋu adzɔ egbea o ene.
I made another life for myself	Mewɔ agbe bubu na ɖokuinye
The room was too small.	Xɔa me nɔ sue akpa.
I am asking for help.	Nyee le kpekpeɖeŋu biam.
But I saw a lot of it today	Gake mekpɔ eƒe akpa gã aɖe egbea
Everything went really well and worked.	Nusianu yi nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ eye wòwɔ dɔ.
They had roots.	Ke nɔ wo ŋu.
He can’t do anything.	Mate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
And nothing is necessary.	Eye naneke mehiã o.
There must be more.	Ele be nu geɖe wu nanɔ anyi.
In the back of a car.	Le ʋu aɖe ƒe megbe.
I would have done it	Anye ne mewɔe hafi
I may have to keep looking	Ðewohĩ ahiã be mayi edzi anɔ nu kpɔm
I doubt he ever complained	Meke ɖi be nya ɖe eŋu kpɔ
It worked out well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
I head better also new	Me ta nyuie wu hã yeye
Keep up your good work.	Yi wò dɔ nyui wɔwɔ dzi.
But this took time.	Gake esia xɔ ɣeyiɣi.
I am fighting for a good cause.	Nu nyui aɖe tae mele avu wɔm ɖo.
It’s been an hour, at this point.	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka enye sia, le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
Now there are four of us.	Fifia míenye ame ene.
A few of them laughed.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ko nu.
But not today.	Gake menye egbea o.
He never went out to them.	Medo go yi wo gbɔ kpɔ o.
I didn’t kill them	Menye nyee wu wo o
It is something that speaks.	Enye nusi ƒoa nu.
I don’t want to see your face.	Nyemedi be makpɔ wò mo o.
Now it is working.	Fifia ele dɔ wɔm.
A few people came to look at us	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo va lé ŋku ɖe mía ŋu
I can’t remember doing this	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi be mewɔ esia o
I think it might go somewhere a little more independent	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ayi teƒe aɖe si le eɖokui si vie wu
It seems quite reasonable	Edze abe susu le eme kura ene
To see my own face like that.	Be makpɔ nye ŋutɔ nye mo nenema.
He always divided the room.	Ema xɔa me ɣesiaɣi.
I was surprised and shocked	Ewɔ nuku nam eye wòwɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
I really liked this about him	Esia dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ le eŋu
I couldn’t think of anyone else	Nyemete ŋu bu ame bubu aɖeke ŋu o
There is no turning back.	Trɔ yi megbe meli o.
If you are like that.	Ne èle nenema.
I don’t want any of them	Nyemedi wo dometɔ aɖeke o
Let me give you my opinion.	Mina magblɔ nye susu.
And you have a hole in your face.	Eye do aɖe le wò mo.
And this is something.	Eye esia nye nane.
I threw his hand away	Metsɔ eƒe asi ƒu gbe
There is nothing here.	Naneke mele afisia o.
I understand the impossible.	Mese nu siwo mate ŋu adzɔ o la gɔme.
Check this out.	Kpɔ esia ɖa.
The point is too clear.	Nya la me kɔ akpa.
I just need a little help	Ðeko mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu vi aɖe
He can continue to eat.	Ate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ nu ɖum.
Not with his big mouth.	Menye kple eƒe nu gã la o.
That seems small.	Edze abe ema le sue ene.
That meant we had a week without a car.	Ema fia be kwasiɖa ɖeka nɔ mía si ʋu aɖeke menɔ mía si o.
I hope I can’t help everyone	Mekpɔ mɔ be nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe amesiame ŋu o

I don’t know what happened to him.	Nyemenya nu si dzɔ ɖe edzi o.

If you can’t, find someone who can.	Ne màte ŋui o la, ke di ame aɖe si ate ŋui.
I was just really tired today.	Ðeko ɖeɖi te ŋunye ŋutɔ egbea.
I look forward to seeing you next week	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be makpɔ wò le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me
I don’t know anything myself	Nye ŋutɔ nyemenya naneke o
This was something he wasn’t ready for.	Esia nye nusi ŋu menɔ klalo na o.
He didn’t remember what it was about.	Meɖo ŋku nusi ku ɖe eŋu dzi o.
In this case, the.	Le go sia me la.
That’s me, just me.	Nyee nye ema, nye koe.
I know what he wants	Menya nusi dim wòle
But he wasn’t there.	Gake menɔ afima o.
I put my head down.	Metsɔ nye ta ɖo anyi.
I saw a lot of it	Mekpɔ nu geɖe le eŋu
Cheap metal is the downside.	Ga si mexɔ asi o ye gblẽ nu le eŋu.
I wish they were.	Ne ɖe wole nenema la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
I needed to save his life.	Ehiã be maɖe eƒe agbe.
I'm sorry for you.	Meɖe kuku na wò.
In fact, it is not.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele nenema o.
I should never have done that	Mele be mawɔ nu ma gbeɖe o
But I didn’t have to do anything.	Gake mehiã be mawɔ naneke o.
I know it doesn’t matter.	Menya be mehiã o.
I will stay for about an hour	Manɔ anyi abe gaƒoƒo ɖeka ene
I wonder why he is doing this	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae wòle esia wɔm hã
Very little really needs to be done.	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe wòle be woawɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I could see the car	Mete ŋu kpɔa ʋua
No one could touch it.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu ka asi eŋu o.
I really can’t handle that one.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu akpɔ ɖeka ma gbɔ o.
This is not a new phenomenon.	Esia menye nu yeye o.
A lot of things.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
And it’s working now.	Eye wòle dɔ wɔm fifia.
But what you are asking for is impossible.	Gake nusi biam nèle la mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I want to know things	Medi be manya nuwo
In fact, this has gone on for far too long.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia yi edzi ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
I felt she of all people could understand	Mese le ɖokuinye me be eya ate ŋu ase egɔme le amewo katã dome
I’m not nearly so sure	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe kloe o
Vaguely, I was surprised.	Le mɔ si me kɔ o nu la, ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
The place where it belongs	Teƒe si wònye tɔ le
But once a week or so, that would be fine.	Gake zi ɖeka le kwasiɖa me alo esi wu nenema la, ema anyo.
That surprised me, really surprised me.	Ema wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ, ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I could have told someone this too	Nye hã mate ŋu agblɔ nya sia na ame aɖe hafi
I hope he prays well.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ado gbe ɖa nyuie.
I was also really angry	Medo dziku hã ŋutɔŋutɔ

It’s a very good thing.	Enye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
That’s a long time.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.

It couldn’t happen.	Mete ŋu adzɔ o.

Which made me want you.	Nukae na meva di wò.

I can’t understand that	Nyemate ŋu ase nya ma gɔme o
I couldn’t get up.	Nyemete ŋu fɔ o.

The opposite is true.	Nusi to vovo na emae nye nyateƒe.

Looking forward to your opinion on it!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na wò susu le eŋu!.

Double check everything.	Kpɔ nusianu ɖa zi eve.

I got closer but couldn’t figure out what it was	Mete ɖe ŋunye gake nyemete ŋu nya nusi wònye o
There is no food involved in doing so.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke mele esia wɔwɔ me o.
I just had to get out	Ðeko wòle be mado go
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
I only care about one thing	Nu ɖeka koe metsɔ ɖe le eme
Death, too.	Ku hã.
In a way, it is.	Le mɔ aɖe nu.
I couldn’t have done this without you	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia wò manɔmee o
I had to let them go	Ele be maɖe asi le wo ŋu
I just think you’re enjoying yourself	Ðeko mesusu be èle dzidzɔ kpɔm
You know.	Ènya.
There is only one thing in each.	Nu ɖeka koe le wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe me.
A thousand feet.	Afɔ akpe ɖeka.
Eye to eye with the eye.	Ŋku ɖe ŋku ŋu.
She would have loved this house.	Anye ne aƒe sia adzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
It won’t last two months.	Manɔ anyi ɣleti eve o.

Look, please take care of it.	Kpɔ ɖa, taflatse kpɔ edzi.
I knew he would act like this	Menya be awɔ nu alea
Its difficult too.	Eƒe sesẽ hã.
They have a lot of space.	Teƒe geɖe le wo si.
He seemed to have something else in mind.	Edze abe nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ susu me nɛ ene.
There was something there after all.	Nane nɔ anyi le afima le nyateƒe me.
I have the whole thing.	Nu bliboa le asinye.

He is never here.	Mele afisia gbeɖe o.
I couldn’t talk about my life to anyone	Nyemete ŋu ƒo nu tso nye agbe ŋu na ame aɖeke o
I know people enough to know that	Menya amewo ale gbegbe be menya ema

He doesn’t need these little stones.	Mehiã kpe sue siawo o.
Your character is beautiful.	Wò nɔnɔme nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
I just couldn’t get over them	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ɖu wo dzi o
In a way, he was alone.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, eya ɖeka koe nɔ esi.
I am looking forward to it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie.
I planned this month carefully	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ɣleti sia ŋu nyuie
But it doesn’t matter one way or the other.	Gake mehiã le mɔ ɖeka alo bubu nu o.
But anything is possible.	Gake nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
There is no money involved.	Ga aɖeke mele eme o.
Probably since this morning.	Anɔ eme be tso ŋdi sia me.
I have heard so much about it.	Mese nu geɖe ŋutɔ tso eŋu.
I was working on a project and saw them	Menɔ dɔ aɖe wɔm eye mekpɔ wo
I want to tell you he’s sick	Medi be magblɔ na wò be edze dɔ
I'll take care of it.	Makpɔ edzi.
I can't believe how he ended up there	Nyemeka ɖe alesi wòwɔ va wu enu ɖe ​​afima dzi o
Everyone agreed.	Amesiame da asi ɖe edzi.
I prayed a lot about that	Medo gbe ɖa geɖe tso ema ŋu
Tell him you think it would be a good idea.	Gblɔ nɛ be yesusu be anye susu nyui aɖe.
But there is a reason behind it again.	Gake susu aɖe le megbe nɛ ake.
This is personal, personal.	Esia nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ, si nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
I glanced at him. 	Meɖe ŋku ɖe eŋu. 
I tried to focus on his face	Medze agbagba be nye susu nanɔ eƒe mo ŋu
This will give me something to look forward to.	Esia ana nane si makpɔ mɔ na la nam.
I would be angry too	Nye hã mado dziku
Think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ.
I don’t understand, really.	Nyemese egɔme o, le nyateƒe me.
But I seem to be far behind.	Gake edze abe metsi megbe kura ene.
None of it made any sense.	Susu aɖeke menɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o.
Otherwise, nothing is.	Ne menye nenema o la, ke naneke mele nenema o.
Everything else is a lie.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nye alakpa.
I work in a very complex way.	Mewɔa dɔ le mɔ si me kɔ ŋutɔ nu.
But then again, so did winter.	Gake le afisia hã la, dzomeŋɔli hã va nɔ nenema.
Look at your heart.	Lé ŋku ɖe wò dzi ŋu.
I am not doing this	Menye nyee le esia wɔm o
But that’s another plan for another time.	Gake ema nye ɖoɖo bubu na ɣeyiɣi bubu.
I have nothing to say to you, nothing to tell you, and I am not.	Nya aɖeke mele asinye magblɔ na mi o, naneke meli magblɔ na mi o, eye nyemele nenema hã o.
I knew he would come to the meeting	Menya be ava kpekpea
Not anger at all.	Menye dziku kura o.
Or he can understand better.	Alo ate ŋu ase egɔme nyuie wu.
There was little time for anything else.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke menɔ anyi na nu bubu aɖeke o.
I don’t know what else it could be.	Nyemenya nu bubu si wòate ŋu anye o.
I, myself, can do nothing	Nye, nye ŋutɔ, mate ŋu awɔ naneke o
None of them did anything wrong.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
And, of course, fire.	Eye, le nyateƒe me la, dzo.
I just have no desire	Ðeko didi aɖeke mele ŋunye o
Things will get better.	Nuwo ava nyo ɖe edzi.
However, this takes time.	Ke hã esia bia ɣeyiɣi.
It is very, very unlikely.	Enye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ kura, kura o.
People will talk about it.	Amewo aƒo nu tso eŋu.
I don’t have a problem with that.	Nyemekpɔ kuxi aɖeke le ema ŋu o.
No one did that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
I can live with that, now	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe kple ema, fifia
I remember a bad thing.	Meɖo ŋku nu gbegblẽ aɖe dzi.
More people are working.	Ame geɖe wu le dɔ wɔm.
Its back to them.	Eƒe megbe na wo.
But only on certain days.	Gake le ŋkeke aɖewo dzi koe.
If not, try to make one yourself.	Ne menye nenema o la, ke wò ŋutɔ dze agbagba nàwɔ ɖeka.
I miss you more than ever	Mesusu wò wu tsã
This is not an easy matter.	Esia menye nya bɔbɔe o.
I think it will take some time.	Mesusu be axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
Still, it is possible.	Ke hã, anya wɔ.
I had to do it my way.	Ele be mawɔe le nye mɔ nu.
This is not a party issue.	Esia menye akpa aɖe ƒe nya aɖe o.

I think the truth would be a good place	Mesusu be nyateƒea anye teƒe nyui aɖe
You are right there.	Èle afima tututu.
He was always such a happy kid.	Enye ɖevi si kpɔa dzidzɔ alea gbegbe ɣesiaɣi.
For now, at least, it’s running.	Fifia la, ele du dzi ya teti.
I had never seen or heard of one	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke kpɔ alo se nu tso eŋu kpɔ o
He couldn’t do it.	Mete ŋu wɔe o.
But, there was none.	Gake, ɖeke menɔ anyi o.
We are going to fight for each other.	Míele avu wɔ ge ɖe mía nɔewo ta.
He had been interested in her.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ kpɔ.
It’s a good plan.	Enye ɖoɖo nyui aɖe.
I will tell you just a few.	Magblɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ko na mi.
Put order in his mind.	De ɖoɖo nu le eƒe susu me.
They had two young children.	Vi sue eve nɔ wo si.
I just need them on me now	Ðeko mehiã wo ɖe dzinye fifia
Not many people have been able to do that.	Menye ame geɖe mete ŋu wɔ nu ma o.
I’m never going to meet him	Nyemele go dom kplii gbeɖe o
He didn’t stand for anything.	Metsi tre ɖe naneke ŋu o.
I’ve never seen you here before	Nyemekpɔ wò le afisia kpɔ o
It worked out very well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.

That wasn’t me.	Menye nyee nye ema o.
There are aspects of that	Ema ƒe akpa aɖewo li
I don’t know about this	Nyemenya nu tso esia ŋu o
Water is an issue.	Tsi nye nya aɖe.
I didn’t see who it was	Nyemekpɔ amesi wònye o
Let me know if you like them.	Na manya ne wo dzɔa dzi na wò.
His people, many of them, can’t find work.	Eƒe amewo, wo dometɔ geɖe, mete ŋu kpɔa dɔ o.
That doesn’t make sense.	Susu mele nya ma me o.
And your money, too.	Eye wò ga hã.
I can’t live without her.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe eya manɔmee o.
Someone was still there, waiting.	Ame aɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ afima, nɔ lalam.
I don’t want to talk	Nyemedi be maƒo nu o
If that happens, it will be two to one.	Ne edzɔ alea la, anye ame eve ɖe ame ɖeka ŋu.
But that’s not the only reason.	Gake menye ema koe nye susu si tae o.
I can’t let go of it	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu o
Now turn to me.	Azɔ trɔ ɖe ŋunye.
It felt like I was at home.	Ewɔ nam abe ɖe mele aƒeme ene.

One day at a time.	Gbe ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.

And he never did anything after that	Eye mewɔ naneke le ema megbe kpɔ o
The teacher felt differently.	Nufiala la se le eɖokui me le mɔ bubu nu.
It had no head.	Ta aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
Period.	Ɣeyiɣi.
Or any gun for that matter.	Alo tu ɖesiaɖe na nya ma.
That’s a plan.	Ema nye ɖoɖo aɖe.
His word is in this matter.	Eƒe nya le nya sia me.
I am against it now.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu fifia.
And not just any problem.	Eye menye kuxi ɖesiaɖe ko o.
I think this is a mistake	Mesusu be vodada aɖee nye esia
He's just doing good with it.	Ðeko wòle nu nyui wɔm le eŋu.

That’s working for me.	Ema le dɔ wɔm nam.
I know what to say.	Menya nya si magblɔ.
I really like this machine	Mɔ̃ sia dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
He doesn't seem to know about this.	Edze abe menya nu tso esia ŋu o ene.
I don’t know why they would do this	Nyemenya nusita woawɔ esia o
I needed to keep my mouth shut.	Ehiã be manɔ nye nu ƒom.
It will still need time	Ahiã ɣeyiɣi kokoko

Surgery is not required.	Mehiã be woawɔ dɔ na ame o.
I desperately needed someone to talk to	Mehiã ame aɖe si mate ŋu aƒo nu kplii ale gbegbe
I couldn’t think of what to say.	Nyemete ŋu bu nya si magblɔ ŋu o.
I didn’t get it right	Nyemese egɔme nyuie o

Maybe you can do it.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋui.

I just don’t feel like myself these days	Ðeko nyemese le ɖokuinye me abe nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye ene le ŋkeke siawo me o
He is doing a lot better.	Ele nu geɖe wɔm nyuie wu.
There was a city like that.	Du aɖe nɔ nenema.
I want to talk to him	Medi be maƒo nu kplii
I understood everything	Mese nusianu gɔme
I never touched it.	Nyemeka asi eŋu kpɔ o.
But here there was only smoke.	Gake le afisia la, dzudzɔ koe nɔ anyi.
This is a problem.	Esia nye kuxi.
I never wanted to do that.	Nyemedi gbeɖe be mawɔ nu ma o.
But this voice did not last long.	Gake gbe sia menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
This certainly makes sense.	Susu le esia me godoo.
I think he was doing that.	Mesusu be nu ma wɔm wònɔ.

As long as you want.	Ɣeyiɣi didi si nèdi.
Can't say enough good things about it.	Mate ŋu agblɔ nya nyui si sɔ tso eŋu o.
But I had a lot to do tonight	Gake nu geɖe nɔ asinye mawɔ le zã sia me
It will be on it.	Anɔ edzi.
It’s a great little town.	Enye du sue gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Just work on your type	Ðeko nàwɔ dɔ tso wò ƒomevi ŋu
I did this in the last project.	Mewɔ esia le dɔ mamlɛtɔ me.

I guess it will depend on how things go at home	Mesusu be anɔ te ɖe alesi nuwo ayi edzi le aƒeme dzi
I should have stayed on.	Ðe wòle be manɔ edzi hafi.
I told you it was a big deal	Megblɔ na mi be enye nya gã aɖe
I know things are not right in your life	Menya be nuwo mele nyuie le wò agbe me o

He never did anything wrong.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke kpɔ o.
But this remains a problem.	Gake esia gakpɔtɔ nye kuxi.
His head is.	Eƒe ta la.
Everyone assured him of this.	Amesiame ka ɖe nya sia dzi nɛ.
I wonder if you can do something about it	Mebia be àte ŋu awɔ nane tso eŋu hã

And so he said nothing.	Eye ale megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
There is nothing new.	Nu yeye aɖeke meli o.
It really is never that simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe gbeɖe o.
I touched my face and felt no more blood	Meka asi nye mo eye mese le ɖokuinye me be ʋu aɖeke megale ŋunye o
I had to take care of things myself	Ele be nye ŋutɔ makpɔ nuwo gbɔ

So far, nothing new.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nu yeye aɖeke meli o.

He attacked the four of us here.	Edze mía ene dzi le afisia.
But this time he did something else.	Gake fifia ya ewɔ nu bubu aɖe.

And that’s part of it.	Eye ema nye eƒe akpa aɖe.

Consider your hand, too.	Bu wò asi hã ŋu kpɔ.

Not really, anyway.	Menye le nyateƒe me o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.

But this is not good in itself.	Gake esia menye nyui aɖeke le eɖokui si o.

I said you can’t.	Megblɔ be màte ŋui o.
I decided to come to his rescue	Meɖoe be mava xɔ nɛ

This could be the same thing.	Esia ate ŋu anye nenema ke.
So many people need help.	Ale gbegbe be ame geɖe hiã kpekpeɖeŋu.

It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I have never been able to focus all day	Nyemete ŋu lé ŋku ɖe nu ŋu ŋkeke bliboa katã kpɔ o
It was a great thing.	Nu gã aɖee wònye.
There was just something so good about it.	Ðeko nane si nyo ŋutɔ la nɔ anyi.
It would be another situation where too little is too late.	Anye nɔnɔme bubu si me nu sue aɖe koe tsi megbe akpa.
Or almost none.	Alo ɖeke kloe o.
I reached for that anger.	Medo asi ɖe dziku ma gbɔ.

Everything here is true, but only part of the truth.	Nusianu le afisia nye nyateƒe, gake nyateƒea ƒe akpa aɖe koe.

Maybe it will be useful.	Ðewohĩ aɖe vi.
I needed them.	Mehiã wo.
There was nothing for me to do.	Naneke menɔ anyi nam be mawɔ o.

I can’t hear, see or feel anything	Nyemate ŋu ase naneke, akpɔ naneke alo ase naneke le ɖokuinye me o
This is too simple.	Esia le bɔbɔe akpa.

He probably wouldn’t.	Anye be mawɔe o.

I can hardly stand his attitude.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe eƒe nɔnɔme nu kura o.

Harsh, angry words he couldn’t hear.	Nya sesẽ siwo me dziku le siwo mete ŋu se o.
I think that was my first mistake.	Mesusu be emae nye nye vodada gbãtɔ.

Until this morning.	Vaseɖe ŋdi sia.
He was fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
A waste of time that didn’t solve anything.	Ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ si mekpɔ naneke gbɔ o.

That part is true.	Akpa ma nye nyateƒe.

I couldn’t figure out what was going on in his head	Nyemete ŋu nya nusi nɔ edzi yim le eƒe ta me o

I don’t need to say much	Mehiã be magblɔ nya geɖe o
Did any of us think it would.	Ðe mía dometɔ aɖe susu be anɔ alea.
I’m glad it’s you.	Edzɔ dzi nam be wòe.
I still don’t understand it	Nyemese egɔme haɖe o
That was new to me.	Ema nye nu yeye nam.
This proves that	Esia ɖo kpe edzi be .
And what do you think?.	Eye nukae nèsusu?.
The one who started it quit.	Ame si dze egɔme la dzudzɔ.
I know they are on your mind	Menya be wole susu me na wò
There were two types at the same time.	Ƒomevi eve nɔ anyi le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
I can make this work.	Mate ŋu ana esia nawɔ dɔ.
I know who did it	Menya amesi wɔe
I need to be happier	Ele be makpɔ dzidzɔ geɖe wu
That’s possible.	Ema anya wɔ.
I want to be like that	Medi be manɔ nenema
It’s just not true.	Ðeko menye nyateƒe o.
I explained, but he didn’t understand	Meɖe eme, gake mese egɔme o
Go anywhere you want.	Yi afi sia afi si nèdi.
It’s like a machine.	Ele abe mɔ̃ ene.
Long ago he might have been expecting it.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia la, ɖewohĩ anɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ.
He had never felt that way before.	Mese le eɖokui me nenema kpɔ o.
Plan a day in advance.	Wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ŋkeke ɖeka ŋu do ŋgɔ.
This is just the first thought.	Susu gbãtɔ koe nye esia.
I thought he would get out of it.	Mesusu be ado go le eme.
I have a lot riding on it.	Nu geɖe le asinye le sɔ dom ɖe edzi.
My mountain.	Nye to.
He was pleased with her for this.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ɖe esia ta.
It made sense.	Susu nɔ eme.
I don’t know what time it is	Nyemenya ɣeyiɣi si me wòle o
And he can’t either.	Eye eya hã mate ŋui o.
I resisted, still not convinced	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu, eye nyemeka ɖe edzi kokoko o
He can’t eat any string.	Mate ŋu aɖu ka aɖeke o.
I pissed you off this morning.	Medo dziku na wò ŋdi sia.
That was the last time.	Emae nye zi mamlɛtɔ.
I was there a lot.	Menɔ afima ŋutɔ.
I didn’t recognize anyone	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke dze sii o
I don’t really want to see or talk to anyone	Nyemedi ŋutɔŋutɔ be makpɔ ame aɖeke alo aƒo nu kplii o
I don’t want to be on my own	Nyemedi be manɔ ɖokuinye si o
It doesn’t meet the normal rules.	Mewɔ ɖeka kple se siwo sɔ o.
It never looked better.	Medze nyuie wu gbeɖe o.
Some of them are private.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
I can wear his face whenever you want	Mate ŋu ado eƒe mo ɣesiaɣi si nèdi
It won’t work.	Mawɔ dɔ o.
The work is also very expensive	Dɔa hã xɔ asi ŋutɔ
If only there was another way.	Ne ɖe mɔ bubu aɖe nanɔ anyi la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
I could never be with anyone else right now	Nyemate ŋu anɔ ame bubu aɖeke gbɔ fifia gbeɖe o
I probably should have mentioned it.	Anɔ eme be ɖe wòle be maƒo nu tso eŋu hafi.
I thought no one would be there	Mesusu be ame aɖeke manɔ afima o
I haven’t been near him in a while	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia nyemete ɖe eŋu o
Kind of like me.	Ƒomevi aɖe abe nye ene.
It was very quick.	Enye kaba ŋutɔ.
I never found out what it was	Nyemekpɔ nusi wònye kpɔ o
I saw a child without legs.	Mekpɔ ɖevi aɖe si afɔ mele o.
I remember that so vividly	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi nyuie ale gbegbe
I miss you so much already	Mesusu wò vevie xoxo
I have seen strange things in the past months	Mekpɔ nu siwo mewɔ nuku o le ɣleti siwo va yi me

Came back in an hour.	Trɔ va le gaƒoƒo ɖeka megbe.
Such a cute little thing.	Nu sue aɖe si nya kpɔ alea gbegbe.
On my feet.	Le nye afɔ dzi.
Or anyone else for that matter.	Alo ame bubu ɖesiaɖe le nya ma ta.
I can only speak for you	Wò ta koe mate ŋu aƒo nu na
If for any reason, he didn't see much.	Ne nya aɖe tae la, ke mekpɔ nu geɖe o.
I think you will enjoy it	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ
I know this time is good.	Menya be ɣeyiɣi sia nyo.
He was very clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ.
With so much smoke, there must be fire.	Esi dzudzɔ sɔ gbɔ alea ta la, ele be dzo nanɔ anyi.
I couldn’t remember it	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi o
That’s like you.	Ema le abe wò ene.
Or he can’t feel satisfied.	Alo mate ŋu ase le eɖokui me be yeƒe dzi dze eme o.
I wonder what is going on	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae le edzi yim hã
And it’s not easy.	Eye mele bɔbɔe o.
There are two things at work there.	Nu eve le dɔ wɔm le afima.
I wondered what it was like after all these years	Mebia ɖokuinye be aleke wònɔ le ƒe siawo katã megbe hã
One name, and another name	Ŋkɔ ɖeka, kple ŋkɔ bubu
I more or less reported to him	Meka nya ta nɛ wu alo wu nenema
Let me explain.	Ðe mɔ maɖe eme.
This is his own business.	Esia nye eya ŋutɔ ƒe nya.
But my point is simple.	Gake nye nya la le bɔbɔe.
I just don’t know what that reason is	Ðeko nyemenya nusi susu ma nye o
That’s why the enrollment has increased so much.	Esia tae ame siwo ŋlɔ ŋkɔ ɖe eme la dzi ɖe edzi ŋutɔ ɖo.
Through a period of time, nothing.	To ɣeyiɣi aɖe me la, naneke meli o.
I can’t live with what he did to me	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe kple nu si wòwɔ ɖe ŋunye o
Trust my word.	Ka ɖe nye nya dzi.
Also, no one seems to know about it.	Azɔ hã, edze abe ame aɖeke menya nu tso eŋu o ene.
I hope you can help me with it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye le eŋu
No one knows his name.	Ame aɖeke menya eƒe ŋkɔ o.
Not sure what to make of it	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ tso eŋu dzi o
But he didn’t live.	Gake menɔ agbe o.
I wish he were here now	Ne ɖe wòle afisia fifia la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
And everything seemed to go pretty well.	Eye edze abe nusianu va yi nyuie ŋutɔ ene.
I did just that on this ship.	Mewɔe nenema tututu le meli sia me.
This one was involved.	Ame sia hã nɔ eme.
I was sure he was going to kill us all	Meka ɖe edzi be ele mí katã wu ge
And I’m sorry for what happened.	Eye meɖe kuku ɖe nusi dzɔ ta.
We’re going to continue.	Míele edzi yim.
I didn’t mean to be so hard on him	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔ nu sesẽ ɖe eŋu nenema gbegbe o
I knew he would be there	Menya be anɔ afima
I don’t know anyone else who can help me	Nyemenya ame bubu aɖeke si ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye o
I can’t take much more than that	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nu geɖe wu ema o
I have already tried and planned our summer.	Medze agbagba dzem xoxo eye mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe míaƒe dzomeŋɔli ŋu.
I hope one of us gets one of us	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mía dometɔ ɖeka axɔ mía dometɔ ɖeka
None of them would be like that.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke manɔ nenema o.
It may never exist.	Ðewohĩ manɔ anyi gbeɖe o.
I understand that too	Mese nya ma hã gɔme
I can’t do something like that	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nane si le abe ema ene o
I could just feel him running.	Ðeko mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me be ele du dzi.
And someone is doing just that.	Eye ame aɖe le nu ma tututu wɔm.
That’s a great market.	Asi gã aɖee nye ema.
I threw this away.	Metsɔ esia ƒu gbe.
A man who.	Ŋutsu aɖe.
That’s a good thing.	Nya nyui aɖee nye ema.
It was never an issue.	Menye nya aɖeke gbeɖe o.
But this is only a necessary condition.	Gake nɔnɔme si hiã koe esia nye.
The reverse is also true.	Nusi to vovo na ema hã le alea.
Take care of that.	Kpɔ ema gbɔ.
I'll let go, if you're ready	Maɖe asi le eŋu, ne èle klalo
It's going well so far.	Ele edzi yim nyuie vaseɖe fifia.
That's ready to go.	Ema le klalo be yeayi.
I remember it now.	Meɖo ŋku edzi azɔ.
It’s here and now.	Enye afisia kple fifia.
I can’t go on living these days.	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ agbe le ŋkeke siawo me o.
But perhaps this is too soon.	Gake ɖewohĩ esia wɔa kaba akpa.
I couldn’t have done that	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema hafi o
I know you know what’s going on	Menya be ènya nusi le edzi yim
I want to know who he is seeing	Medi be manya ame si kpɔm wòle
Perhaps this is appropriate.	Ðewohĩ esia sɔ.
It will give him a try.	Ana wòate kpɔ.
Can you please tell me how to do it.	Taflatse àte ŋu agblɔ alesi mawɔe nam.
But that is a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖee nye ema.
I just couldn’t wait to see you	Ðeko nyemete ŋu nɔ lalam be makpɔ wò o
Which could have been true.	Nusi ate ŋu anye nyateƒe hafi.
And so is everyone else, including you, where they are.	Eye nenema ke ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã, wò hã, le afisi wole.
This is better than that.	Esia nyo wu.
Many of them are about me	Wo dometɔ geɖe ku ɖe ŋunye
Everything is still in place.	Nusianu gakpɔtɔ le teƒe ɖeka.
Which is fine anyway.	Nusi nyo le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
It’s not easy.	Mele bɔbɔe o.
He didn’t want me to be there	Medi be manɔ afima o
I wonder if he is new	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe wònye ame yeye hã
I didn’t think it would come so soon	Nyemesusu be ava kaba nenema o
I couldn’t see myself marrying anyone else	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ ɖokuinye be maɖe ame bubu aɖeke o
I had the whole afternoon to myself	Mekpɔ ŋdɔ bliboa na ɖokuinye
And when that day comes.	Eye ne ŋkeke ma ɖo.
I also want to get to know you better	Medi hã be manya wò nyuie
I couldn’t bear the loss of another child	Nyemete ŋu do dzi le vi bubu ƒe ku me o
I think it probably would, actually.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ awɔe nenema, le nyateƒe me.
I suddenly found myself	Mekpɔ ɖokuinye zi ɖeka
I just met with him today	Ðeko medo go kplii egbea koe nye ema
This will actually take two people.	Esia axɔ ame eve ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I said my name and promised everything was fine	Megblɔ nye ŋkɔ eye medo ŋugbe be nusianu nyo
But he couldn’t do that.	Gake mete ŋu wɔ ema o.
Sprinkle with salt.	Tsɔ dze ƒo ɖe eme.
None of us really felt the need.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mese le eɖokui me ŋutɔŋutɔ be ehiã o.
I had a rather interesting crazy life	Agbe si me susu mele o si doa dzidzɔ nam vie la nɔ asinye
I was in your head for months	Menɔ ta me na wò ɣleti geɖe
In the same way.	Le mɔ ma ke nu.
I have to focus on my work now	Ele be nye susu nanɔ nye dɔa ŋu fifia
This, there is no prior work in this field.	Esia, dɔ aɖeke meli do ŋgɔ le go sia me o.
I have never been so happy	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ nenema gbegbe kpɔ o
I started to get bored	Meva nɔ fu ɖem nam
That’s my plan as well.	Emae nye nye ɖoɖo hã.
I want things to be simple	Medi be nuwo nanɔ bɔbɔe
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
I have to go with this one	Ele nam be mayi kple esia
He can do that.	Ate ŋu awɔe nenema.
There was just so much going on in my head	Ðeko nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ edzi yim le nye ta me
I am only a replacement	Ame si axɔ ɖe eteƒe koe menye
There is so much we don’t know.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li míenya o.
Click on your room.	Zi wò xɔa dzi.
It shouldn’t be a surprise.	Mele be wòawɔ nuku o.
I was waiting for someone like you	Menɔ ame aɖe si le abe wò ene lalam
Who does that stuff.	Amekae wɔa nu ma.
I came to the same conclusion myself.	Nye ŋutɔ hã meva ƒo nya ta nenema ke.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe tae wòle alea ɖo.
I couldn’t connect with them.	Nyemete ŋu do ka kpli wo o.
It’s what you’re for.	Enye nusi ta nèle.
From death, something beautiful will be created.	Tso ku me la, woawɔ nane si nya kpɔ.
I stayed in his room every night	Metsi eƒe xɔ me zã ɖesiaɖe
I understand your anger	Mese wò dziku gɔme
I had to let go of it	Ele nam be maɖe asi le eŋu
I know what’s going on here.	Menya nusi le edzi yim le afisia.
I can see that on your face.	Mete ŋu kpɔa ema le wò mo.
I would be angry too.	Nye hã mado dziku.
I didn’t know what to expect.	Nyemenya nusi makpɔ mɔ na o.
Actually, it will work well with it.	Le nyateƒe me la, awɔ dɔ nyuie kplii.
I did this to him	Mewɔ esia ɖe eŋu
But take a closer look.	Gake lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie.
I knew exactly what was going to happen	Menya nusi tututu ava dzɔ
He didn’t know this guy.	Menya ŋutsu sia o.
But cook that thing.	Gake ɖa nu ma.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
I missed my teaching job	Nye nufiala ƒe dɔa to ŋunye
It had been a great first season for us.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gbãtɔ gã aɖe na mí tsã.
That made sense to me.	Susu nɔ nya ma me nam.
I can give you a job	Mate ŋu ana dɔ wò
I can’t let them do that	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ na wo be woawɔ nu ma o
For some reason it is not working.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, mele dɔ wɔm o.

It seems to be important.	Edze abe ele vevie ene.
He did not say what this man would do to her.	Megblɔ nusi ŋutsu sia awɔ ɖe eŋu o.
It’s one on one.	Enye ame ɖeka ɖe ame dzi.
They’re there.	Wole afima.
We just can’t do it.	Ðeko míate ŋui o.
A man with a lot of money	Ŋutsu aɖe si si ga geɖe le
But this person can.	Gake ame sia ate ŋui.

I was just talking to him	Ðeko menɔ nu ƒom kplii
You have two wonderful children.	Vi nyui eve le asiwò.
This is very problematic.	Esia nye kuxi ŋutɔ.
We didn’t know each other that well yet.	Míenya mía nɔewo nyuie nenema haɖe o.
Something was going on.	Nane nɔ edzi yim.
I saw something.	Mekpɔ nane.

People are like me.	Amewo le abe nye ene.

It will need time, maybe a long time.	Ahiã ɣeyiɣi, ɖewohĩ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
Everyone will know.	Amesiame anya.
We are talking about something far more important.	Míele nu ƒom tso nane si le vevie wu kura ŋu.
It would have been so much easier, too.	Anye ne anɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe, hã.
I don’t want to do this to you	Nyemedi be mawɔ nu sia ɖe ŋuwò o
I know what needs to be done	Menya nusi wòle be woawɔ

I haven’t heard anything yet.	Nyemese naneke haɖe o.
I can only call you once	Zi ɖeka koe mate ŋu aƒo ka na wò
But he couldn’t.	Gake mete ŋui o.
Ask a question too personal.	Bia nya aɖe si nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa.
We are just getting started.	Ðeko míele egɔme dzem.
We hope you enjoy it.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò.
But he didn’t let go.	Gake meɖe asi le eŋu o.

I really couldn’t stop eating	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemete ŋu dzudzɔ nuɖuɖu o
You are someone just like me.	Ame aɖee nènye abe nye ke ene.

It would be great for me.	Anyo nam ŋutɔ.
To someone who.	To ame si.
I had no idea things were so bad	Nyemenya kura be nuwo gblẽ alea gbegbe o
I remember that meal as my first breakfast in years	Meɖo ŋku nuɖuɖu ma dzi be enye nye ŋdi nuɖuɖu gbãtɔ le ƒe geɖe me
How it had been for him, for all of them.	Aleke gbegbe wònɔ nɛ tsã, na wo katã.
I really don’t want to be alone	Nyemedi ŋutɔŋutɔ be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi o
I couldn’t imagine what my face must have looked like	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ alesi nye mo anya nɔ le susu me o
He had no children of his own.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe vi aɖeke menɔ esi o.
I can’t see them.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wo o.
There were guys who waited a year.	Ŋutsu aɖewo nɔ anyi siwo nɔ lalam ƒe ɖeka.

At least two of them.	Wo dometɔ eve ya teti.

Otherwise, stick with it.	Ne menye nenema o la, ke lé ɖe eŋu.

But that didn’t make sense to us.	Gake susu menɔ nya ma me na mí o.
I need some alone time	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi aɖe na nye ɖeka
There was a lot of blood.	Ʋu geɖe nɔ afima.

You are not free at all.	Vovo mele ŋuwò kura o.

I really wanted to know how he got so smart	Medi vevie be manya alesi wòwɔ va dze aɖaŋu nenema gbegbe
Yet soon after, he collapsed.	Ke hã le ema megbe teti la, edze anyi.
However, tonight was different.	Ke hã, zã sia me to vovo.
Just think of one.	Bu ɖeka ŋu ko.
And on the surface, too.	Eye le edzi hã.

No mistake, nothing.	Vodada aɖeke meli o, naneke meli o.

No one really knows what happened to them, either.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi tututu dzɔ ɖe wo dzi o, nenema ke.

And his dog died too.	Eye eƒe avu hã ku.

He was very happy about that.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ ɖe nya ma ŋu.
I am in control	Nyee le dzi ɖum
Now look at you.	Azɔ kpɔ wò ɖa.
His face worked.	Eƒe mo wɔ dɔ.
Maybe not in a bad way.	Ðewohĩ menye le mɔ gbegblẽ nu o.
I wanted to do something completely different from them.	Medi be mawɔ nane si to vovo kura tso wo gbɔ.
A small breeze blew	Ya sue aɖe ƒo ɖe eŋu
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This tooth has two roots	Ke eve le aɖu sia ŋu
He can’t do anything, no way.	Mate ŋu awɔ naneke o, mɔ aɖeke meli o.
I just couldn’t get over it	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ɖu edzi o
I have to see them.	Ele be makpɔ wo.
We have to keep our word.	Ele be míawɔ ɖe míaƒe nya dzi.
I gave up a little time there	Meɖe asi le ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe ŋu le afima
I have seen this type of system and it worked very well.	Mekpɔ ɖoɖo sia ƒomevi eye wòwɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
I had heard of it before	Mese eŋu nya kpɔ do ŋgɔ
Nothing is more important than that	Naneke mele vevie wu ema o
But I can’t make it work.	Gake nyemate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ o.
It’s a strong market.	Asi sesẽ aɖee wònye.
Otherwise, we have what we have.	Ne menye nenema o la, nu si le mía si la le mía si.
I saw something very strange	Mekpɔ nane si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
I almost told you too much	Megblɔ nya geɖe na wò kloe
I hope he is there	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ele afima
Everything is fine now.	Nusianu nyo fifia.
Do this once or twice a week.	Wɔ esia zi ɖeka alo zi eve le kwasiɖa me.
It won’t be that easy.	Manɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
Yet he could not write.	Ke hã mete ŋu ŋlɔ nu o.
I have eyes and ears in his work	Ŋku kple to le asinye le eƒe dɔa me
I want to be able to save myself	Medi be mate ŋu aɖe ɖokuinye
I should have known.	Ðe wòle be manya hafi.
I told them where he was	Megblɔ afisi wòle na wo
They are so alive.	Wole agbe ale gbegbe.
I have no words to explain	Nya aɖeke mele asinye maɖe eme o
You said something offensive.	Ègblɔ nya aɖe si doa dziku na ame.
I told you that before.	Megblɔ nya ma na wò kpɔ.
I know every one of them	Menya wo dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe
I just wanted to be alone for a bit	Ðeko medi be nye ɖeka manɔ afima vie
We can give them that.	Míate ŋu ana ema wo.
But some things are the same.	Gake nu aɖewo le ɖeka.
I don’t know where he is.	Nyemenya afi si wòle o.
I know this situation	Menya nɔnɔme sia
But only by a little bit.	Gake to vi aɖe ko dzi.
Be one of the characters.	Nye ame ɖeka.
If you can do it, you do it.	Ne àte ŋu awɔe la, ke wòe wɔe.
I can get pregnant now	Mate ŋu afɔ fu fifia
In fact, that does explain a lot.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema ɖe nu geɖe me nyateƒe.
I recognized a few from school	Mekpɔ ame ʋɛ aɖewo dze sii tso suku
I can’t seem to replace him	Edze abe nyemate ŋu axɔ ɖe eteƒe o ene
I told you to do something.	Megblɔ na wò be nàwɔ nane.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
I am not just a ship.	Menye meli koe meli nye o.
They have no children.	Vi aɖeke mele wo si o.
So far, no good results have been achieved.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nu nyui aɖeke medo tso eme o.
But his case was minor.	Gake eƒe nya la nɔ sue ŋutɔ.
But it’s not true.	Gake menye nyateƒe o.
Some people have no problems.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ame aɖewo ŋu o.
Perhaps you have experienced the same thing yourself.	Ðewohĩ wò ŋutɔ hã to nu ma ke me kpɔ.
Maybe this will help you.	Ðewohĩ esia akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I want to talk	Medi be maƒo nu
And this obviously happened for a reason.	Eye edze ƒã be susu aɖe tae esia dzɔ ɖo.
I'll let go of that	Maɖe asi le nya ma ŋu
I only know about the mountain	To la ŋu koe menya
I really don’t know.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya o.
I’m so glad you’re alive	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be èle agbe
I’m not okay without him.	Nyemele nyuie eya manɔmee.
I had a very active mind	Susu si le dɔ wɔm ŋutɔ nɔ asinye
I am trying to do just that	Mele agbagba dzem be mawɔ nu ma tututu
Do you think that	Èsusu be .
However, time is a big problem.	Ke hã, ɣeyiɣi nye kuxi gã aɖe.
I have a lot of things.	Nu geɖe le asinye.
He lost them all.	Wo katã bu nɛ.
I want you with everything I have	Medi wò kple nye nusianu
I wanted to stay a little longer	Medi be manɔ anyi vie
But, to the surprise of many, it worked.	Gake, ewɔ nuku na ame geɖe be ewɔ dɔ.
I'm going through it	Mele to me tom
I see nothing wrong with that	Nyemekpɔ naneke si gblẽ le ema ŋu o
I was expecting a lot from this one	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na nu geɖe tso ame sia si
But I think he looked a little tired, actually	Gake mesusu be edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu vie ene, le nyateƒe me
I just received them last week	Ðeko mexɔ wo le kwasiɖa si va yi me
I want everyone to be united.	Medi be amesiame nawɔ ɖeka.
Join .	Geɖe eme .
I can handle my stuff	Mete ŋu kpɔa nye nuwo gbɔ
However, it is somehow not working.	Ke hã, mele dɔ wɔm le mɔ aɖe nu o.
I knew his name, but he didn’t know that	Menya eƒe ŋkɔ, gake menya ema o
I don’t know what I would do in that situation.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ le nɔnɔme ma me o.
I recognized his distinctive face at once	Mekpɔ eƒe mo si to vovo la dze sii zi ɖeka
I can fight this.	Mate ŋu awɔ avu kple esia.
To some extent, that doesn’t matter.	Vaseɖe afi aɖe la, ema mehiã o.
That calmed me down a bit.	Ema na nye dzi dze eme vie.
He needs someone to take care of him.	Ehiã ame aɖe si akpɔ edzi.
I would love to fight him.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔ avu kplii.
He had just had an idea	Ðeko susu aɖe va susu me nɛ teti koe nye ema
I wasn’t planning on doing this	Menye ɖe menɔ ɖoɖo wɔm be mawɔ esia o
I had fun last night	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ le zã si va yi me
Try the whole version.	Te eƒe akpa bliboa kpɔ.
I saw where he was	Mekpɔ afisi wòle
I work best alone.	Nye ɖeka koe wɔa dɔ nyuie wu.
I did it in a different way	Mewɔe le mɔ bubu nu
A happy horse to a happy home	Sɔ si le dzidzɔ kpɔm yi aƒe si me dzidzɔ le me
Difficult but not impossible.	Sesẽ gake menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I can’t stand this life anymore	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi le agbe sia me azɔ o
Someone else must have taken care of them.	Anɔ eme be ame bubu aɖee kpɔ wo dzi.
He has no characteristics.	Nɔnɔme aɖeke mele esi o.
I still had a lot on my mind	Nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ susu me nam
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
You are the right person.	Ènye ame si sɔ.
I'm almost certain it is	Meka ɖe edzi kloe be ele nenema
He probably had a different opinion.	Anɔ eme be eƒe susu to vovo.
There needs to be an appropriate system.	Ele be ɖoɖo si sɔ nanɔ anyi.
That makes two of them.	Ema wɔe be wo dometɔ eve.
I saw this as an opportunity	Mekpɔ esia be enye mɔnukpɔkpɔ
No one told me anything.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke nam o.
I don’t know anything about it.	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o.
And I myself	Eye nye ŋutɔ hã .
That might have been quite possible at that point.	Ðewohĩ ema anya wɔ kura le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
There was only one thing time.	Nu ɖeka koe ɣeyiɣi nɔ anyi.
The near future is this year.	Ɣeyiɣi si gbɔna kpuie enye ƒe sia me.
I didn’t expect much	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na nu geɖe o
There are always people who are begging.	Ame siwo le kuku ɖem la nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi.
I was the only one who didn’t do much	Nye ɖeka koe mewɔ nu boo aɖeke o
Things were going the same way here.	Nuwo nɔ edzi yim nenema le afisia hã.
I didn’t look inside, but there were a lot of them	Nyemekpɔ eme o, gake wo dometɔ geɖe nɔ anyi
I couldn’t go to school	Nyemete ŋu yi suku o
I put my hand over my mouth.	Metsɔ nye asi ɖo nye nu dzi.
I really need fresh air	Mehiã ya nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ
Or maybe no one cares.	Alo ɖewohĩ ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
He was a clear man.	Enye amesi me kɔ.
Something wasn’t working.	Nane menɔ dɔ wɔm o.
That can do things.	Ema ate ŋu awɔ nu.
Let’s do this.	Mina míawɔ esia.
I did the same thing.	Nye hã mewɔe nenema ke.
I wanted something small, but not too small.	Medi nane si le sue, gake menye nu sue akpa o.
I wanted it to be surprising	Medi be wòawɔ nuku na ame
He won’t do that.	Mawɔe nenema o.
I could go on for hours.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi gaƒoƒo geɖe.
I could see his back	Mete ŋu kpɔa eƒe megbe
There is none of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
The truth is quite different.	Nyateƒea to vovo kura.
Eating is easy on the go.	Nuɖuɖu le bɔbɔe ne wole mɔ dzi.
I don’t know what happened to him	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi o
There is nothing in between.	Naneke mele wo dome o.
I think we have it.	Mesusu be ele mía si.
I understand that this is appropriate	Mese egɔme be esia sɔ
I had never heard of him	Nyemese eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ o
Her home is not a home without her.	Eƒe aƒe menye aƒe si me eya manɔmee o.
Now you can answer.	Fifia àte ŋu aɖo nya ŋu.
I think he deserves that.	Mesusu be edze na ema.
These kinds of things.	Nu siawo ƒomevi.
That shouldn’t be done.	Mele be woawɔ nu ma o.
I will always be in a hurry	Manɔ kaba ɣesiaɣi
I remembered some things	Meɖo ŋku nu aɖewo dzi
He quickly came to their aid.	Ewɔ kaba va kpe ɖe wo ŋu.
I was waiting for you	Menɔ lalam na wò
A very interesting man.	Ŋutsu aɖe si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
You can go anywhere.	Àte ŋu ayi afi sia afi.
Nothing strange about that.	Naneke mewɔ nuku le ema ŋu o.
I was in a crowded pit	Menɔ do aɖe si me amewo sɔ gbɔ ɖo me
An extremely good time.	Ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe si gbɔ eme.
I'd better call him	Anyo be maƒo ka nɛ
Let's stay well like this.	Mina nyuie nɔ anyi alea.
I did it to save my people	Mewɔe be maɖe nye amewo
I’ve never seen this guy before	Nyemekpɔ ŋutsu sia kpɔ o
I was really worried	Metsi dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ
And that’s what it is.	Eye emae nye ema.
I need some kind of rope	Mehiã ka ƒomevi aɖe
Tell me what you think about that.	Gblɔ nusi nèsusu tso nya ma ŋu nam.
This can take several days, or more.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ ŋkeke geɖe, alo esi wu nenema.
I needed to work.	Ehiã be mawɔ dɔ.
Not enough room in my house for all of them.	Teƒe si sɔ gbɔ le nye aƒea me na wo katã o.
Other than that, he felt the same as me.	Ne menye nenema o la, eya hã se le eɖokui me abe nye ene.
I would have known about it.	Anye ne manya nu tso eŋu.
It’s always something in between.	Enye nane si le wo dome ɣesiaɣi.
He was an incredible person.	Enye ame si mewɔ nuku o.
Not like himself.	Menye abe eya ŋutɔ ene o.
I know what you want to do	Menya nu si nèdi be yeawɔ
I know it’s not the same as the people here	Menya be menye nu ɖeka kple ame siwo le afisia tɔ o
Clearly, that is no longer the case.	Edze ƒã be megale nenema o.
But he didn’t say anything.	Gake megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I’ve heard that song before.	Mese ha ma do ŋgɔ.
I can't get it to work anyway so far.	Nyemate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ le mɔ aɖeke nu vaseɖe fifia o.
I needed the job.	Mehiã dɔa.
I’m not here to fight you	Menye ɖe mele afisia be mawɔ avu kpli wò o
I didn’t have time to enjoy it	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye makpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu o
I quickly headed to my car	Meɖo ta nye ʋua gbɔ kaba
Life was too busy for that.	Vovo menɔ agbe ŋu akpa na ema.
It’s something everyone can do.	Enye nusi amesiame ate ŋu awɔ.
It’s not enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
I could have controlled myself better.	Anye ne mate ŋu aɖu ɖokuinye dzi nyuie wu hafi.
I have seen this too many times.	Mekpɔ esia zi gbɔ zi geɖe akpa.
In theory, this is true.	Le susu me la, esia nye nyateƒe.
Someone who has a point.	Ame aɖe si si nya aɖe le.
I don’t want that for anyone	Nyemedi nenema na ame aɖeke o
That couldn’t have happened.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ hafi o.
Someone really bright	Ame aɖe si me kɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ
I could really imagine the whole situation	Mete ŋu kpɔ nɔnɔme bliboa le susu me ŋutɔŋutɔ
You can’t really work on them.	Màte ŋu awɔ dɔ le wo ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
It’s not the right thing to do.	Menye nusi sɔ o.
You can do it.	Àte ŋui.
I think he’s really cute	Mesusu be eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
I think this is another first for me	Mesusu be esia nye gbãtɔ bubu nam
There will be something somewhere to help us.	Nane ava nɔ afi aɖe si akpe ɖe mía ŋu.
Maybe I should go	Ðewohĩ ele be mayi
Now, think about that.	Azɔ, bu nya ma ŋu kpɔ.
And he didn’t do that.	Eye mewɔe nenema o.
I couldn’t remember anything at all	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku naneke dzi kura o
Let that do what you want.	Na ema wɔ nusi nèdi.
Come on, there’s a lot of money in this.	Va, ga geɖe le esia me.
I just couldn’t deal with him at this hour.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu wɔ nu kplii le gaƒoƒo sia me o.
A new idea is in order.	Susu yeye aɖe le ɖoɖo nu.
But you know the type.	Gake ènya ƒomevi si le eme.
It doesn’t work very well.	Mewɔa dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ o.
And yet, he never did.	Eye ke hã, mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
We know he is not normal.	Míenya be menye ame si ƒe nɔnɔme sɔ o.
That is very expensive.	Ema xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I am amazed that I am alive.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ be mele agbe.
Something that needs to be done.	Nane si wòle be woawɔ.
I want to do some good things	Medi be mawɔ nu nyui aɖewo
What he did after that was up to him.	Nusi wòwɔ le ema megbe la tso eya ŋutɔ gbɔ.
But it’s not yet.	Gake menye haɖe o.
And not in a good way either.	Eye menye le mɔ nyui aɖe nu hã o.
I would love that.	Ema adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I never expected that	Nyemekpɔ mɔ nenema kpɔ o
Where is it located.	Afikae wòle.
Maybe he can do it now.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu awɔe fifia.
Please let me know where I went wrong.	Taflatse na manya afisi mewɔ vodada le.
It could save your life!.	Ate ŋu axɔ na wò agbe!.
I need to know what’s going on	Ele be manya nusi le edzi yim
People have heard this before.	Amewo se nya sia kpɔ.
The name you are looking for.	Ŋkɔ si dim nèle.
He never said anything or anything at all.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke alo nya aɖeke kura kpɔ o.
Maybe this could go somewhere.	Ðewohĩ esia ate ŋu ayi afi aɖe.
I know you can do better	Menya be àte ŋu awɔe nyuie wu
It cannot go further.	Mate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu ema o.
There is nothing to do.	Naneke meli woawɔ o.
But it can tell you a lot.	Gake ate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe na wò.
A bit of fresh air.	Ya nyui aɖe si le eme vie.
He’s got his hands on it.	Eƒe asi le eŋu.
That just can’t happen.	Ðeko ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I could see them, but I couldn’t touch them	Mete ŋu kpɔa wo, gake nyemete ŋu ka asi wo ŋu o
I'll have time.	Makpɔ ɣeyiɣi.
I don’t know why he’s here	Nyemenya nusita wòle afisia o
There is no air either.	Ya aɖeke hã meli o.
Many others joined him	Ame bubu geɖe hã va kpe ɖe eŋu
I needed to know if	Ehiã be manya nenye be
Home from home.	Aƒe tso aƒeme.
He can do more.	Ate ŋu awɔ geɖe wu.
I couldn’t see anything yet	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ naneke haɖe o
It didn’t bother us.	Meɖe fu na mí o.
I really had no reason to be there	Le nyateƒe me la, susu aɖeke menɔ asinye si tae manɔ afima o
This is impossible to do.	Esia manya wɔ be woawɔ o.
It’s a harsh reality.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ sesẽ aɖe.
It can work.	Ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
I heard something now too	Mese nya aɖe fifia hã
I lived through it all	Menɔ agbe to wo katã me
I never understood a word.	Nyemese nya aɖeke gɔme kpɔ o.
Add more water if needed.	Tsɔ tsi bubu kpe ɖe eŋu ne ehiã.
You can do it instead.	Àte ŋu awɔe ɖe eya teƒe.
He's having a tough time, too.	Ele ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe me tom, eya hã.
Who he used to be.	Ame si wònye tsã.
Ask a lot of questions.	Bia nya geɖe.
I have been wanting to share that with you for some time.	Medi be magblɔ nya ma na mi ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
I'll test that in the morning	Mado ema kpɔ le ŋdi me
He probably didn’t feel anything inside him.	Anɔ eme be mese le eɖokui me be naneke le ye me o.
I couldn’t eat for almost a month	Nyemete ŋu ɖu nu o ɣleti ɖeka kloe
I know about this place	Menya nu tso teƒe sia ŋu
Good night, now.	Zã nyui na wò, fifia.
He will eat from that.	Aɖu nu tso ema dzi.
I was angry with him.	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu.
I am on the first hour.	Mele gaƒoƒo gbãtɔ dzi.
I’m not really sure.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
You can leave your room.	Àte ŋu ado le wò xɔ me.
I can’t stand this.	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi le esia nu o.
Suggest this project.	Do dɔ sia ɖa.
Nothing is excessive.	Naneke meli si gbɔ eme o.
Life is good now.	Agbe nyo fifia.
If it hadn’t come to this	Ne ɖe meva ɖo esia gbɔ o la, anye ne mewɔe nenema o
I could see the hand.	Mete ŋu kpɔa asi la.
We have a couple of reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo le mía si.
Check that out below.	Kpɔ ema te ɖa.
However this is not very easy.	Ke hã esia mele bɔbɔe boo o.
I have to see this dog.	Ele nam be makpɔ avu sia.
Do what you have to do.	Wɔ nu si wòle be nàwɔ.
I felt it was short.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ele kpuie.
I should be, but the money won’t be there, somehow	Ele be manɔ nenema, gake ga la manɔ anyi o, le mɔ aɖe nu
I think we’ll work on it	Mesusu be míawɔ dɔ tso eŋu
We are behind you.	Míele megbe na wò.
Get started now.	Dze egɔme fifia.
He’s probably fine.	Anɔ eme be ele nyuie.
At least on my first night.	Le nye zã gbãtɔ ya teti me.
And he had an idea or two of his own.	Eye eya ŋutɔ ƒe susu ɖeka alo eve nɔ esi.
I can't seem to find it	Edze abe nyemate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu o ene
Everyone has a past.	Nusi dzɔ va yi le amesiame si.
Two problems appear here.	Kuxi eve dze le afisia.
I didn’t hear anything.	Nyemese naneke o.
It’s obviously great.	Edze ƒã be enye gã.
His hand.	Eƒe asi.
I burned with desire to be like him	Mexɔ dzo kple didi be mava nɔ abe eya ene
I made you from the dust	Mewɔ wò tso ɖi me
It didn’t surprise me.	Mewɔ nuku nam o.
I'm not sure about this plan yet	Nyemeka ɖe ɖoɖo sia dzi haɖe o
I thought your here	Mesusu be wò le afisia
I had four children and that was enough for me	Vi ene nɔ asinye eye ema sɔ gbɔ nam
Honestly, I ordered a little bit of everything	Le nyateƒe me la, mebia nusianu ƒe vi aɖe
It makes sense, too.	Susu le eme hã.
There are many rooms in it.	Xɔ geɖe le eme.
I could see them so clearly	Mete ŋu kpɔa wo nyuie ale gbegbe
I wondered who did that	Mebia ɖokuinye be amekae wɔ nu ma hã
I had many reasons for asking them	Susu geɖe nɔ asinye si ta mebia wo ɖo
Or for some other reason.	Alo le susu bubu aɖe ta.
There was a large hole in front of his head.	Do gã aɖe nɔ eƒe ta ŋgɔ.
And it’s not surprising.	Eye mewɔ nuku o.
A rage overwhelmed him	Dziku aɖe xɔ aƒe ɖe eme
I am too old for you.	Metsi akpa na wò.
I honestly can’t remember	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi o
They will do this.	Woawɔ esia.
This worked well.	Esia wɔ dɔ nyuie.
That is so difficult.	Ema sesẽ ale gbegbe.
They are in order.	Wole ɖoɖo nu.
I was more surprised	Mewɔ nuku nam wu
Some very simple things.	Nu bɔbɔe aɖewo ŋutɔ.
He threw them as best he could.	Etsɔ wo ƒu gbe alesi wòate ŋui.
I don’t know about anyone else	Nyemenya nu tso ame bubu aɖeke ŋu o
But no one could find them.	Gake ame aɖeke mete ŋu ke ɖe wo ŋu o.
This whole year has been amazing	Ƒe sia katã wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
I need water.	Mehiã tsi.
I like your hair.	Wò ɖa dzɔa dzi nam.
And nothing was working.	Eye naneke menɔ dɔ wɔm o.
Go back to the house.	Trɔ yi aƒeme.
I’ve done something wrong	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ
Finally, he made a face.	Mlɔeba la, ewɔ mo.
This guy is older.	Ŋutsu sia tsi wu.
I may be home soon	Ðewohĩ mava aƒeme kpuie
I need you in though	Mehiã wò le eme ke hã
I could stay here for another two weeks	Mate ŋu anɔ afisia kwasiɖa eve bubu
I salute you horse.	Medo gbe na wò sɔ.
A house is a machine.	Aƒe nye mɔ̃.
Maybe he will.	Ðewohĩ awɔe.
Not a little bit, really.	Menye nu sue aɖe koe o, le nyateƒe me.
Please think about it.	Taflatse bu eŋu kpɔ.
I never went out alone	Nye ɖeka medo go kpɔ o
I have said this.	Megblɔ nya sia.
A lot of things happened.	Nu geɖe dzɔ.
And he will do it, too.	Eye eya hã awɔe.
I may never have another one, you know	Ðewohĩ bubu aɖeke manɔ asinye gbeɖe o, ènya
I am everything but not okay yet.	Nyee nye nusianu gake mele nyuie haɖe o.
I thought he would beat them	Mesusu be aƒo wo
In short, the.	Kpuie ko la.
Use a new person.	Zã ame yeye.
If only there was room	Ne ɖe teƒe aɖe nanɔ anyi la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
I have to say I’m sorry	Ele nam be magblɔ be meɖe kuku nɛ
I said this matter-of-factly.	Megblɔ nya sia le nyateƒe me.
I think it’s there now	Mesusu be ele afima fifia
I had a nice apartment.	Xɔ nyui aɖe nɔ asinye.
It really worked.	Ewɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I couldn’t catch anything all night	Nyemete ŋu lé naneke le zã bliboa me o
And so was he, too.	Eye eya hã nɔ nenema.
Everything is wrong with the idea that it is there.	Nusianu gblẽ le susu ŋu be ele afima.
I can’t see his face	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ eƒe mo o
I’m not going to let this go.	Nyemele asi ɖe ge le esia ŋu o.
I felt honored and important	Mese le ɖokuinye me be bubu le ŋunye eye mele vevie ŋutɔ
I couldn’t resist it	Nyemete ŋu tsi tre ɖe eŋu o
I think, that you are wrong	Mesusu be, be mèle eteƒe o
I know exactly where to go	Menya afisi tututu mayi
I want this more than anything	Medi esia wu nusianu
I can’t stay overnight	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afima zã ɖeka o
Find your room.	Di wò xɔ.
Some of us really annoy him.	Mía dometɔ aɖewo doa dziku nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Everyone was either for us or against us.	Ame sia ame nɔ mía gbɔ alo tsi tre ɖe mía ŋu.
It is the present chapter.	Enye ta si li fifia.
No one can do it.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋui o.
I would have told me that	Anye ne megblɔ nya ma nam hafi
I know.	Menya.
And he didn’t get one.	Eye mexɔ ɖeka hã o.
Leave the air alone	Gblẽ ya la ɖi
I needed to know where he had been	Ehiã be manya afisi wònɔ tsã
This is a very passionate project.	Esia nye dɔ si me dzo le ŋutɔ.
I needed to work out what was going on	Ehiã be mawɔ dɔ tso nusi nɔ edzi yim ŋu
It's just, like.	Ðeko wòle, abe.
I couldn’t want anything more	Nyemate ŋu adi naneke wu ema o
But this is really bad.	Gake esia gblẽ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But it’s not a surprise at all.	Gake menye nusi wɔ nuku kura o.
I didn’t know what to say to him	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ nɛ o
This couldn’t be further from the truth.	Esia mate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu nyateƒea o.
And something is different between us.	Eye nane to vovo le mía dome.
I think it will stay here	Mesusu be anɔ afisia
Like a person.	Abe ame ene.
I remembered something	Meɖo ŋku nane dzi
I didn’t know he was there	Nyemenya be ele afima o
I can’t do anything for you today	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke na wò egbea o
I’ve done that before	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ
I was in control of this	Nyee nɔ esia dzi ɖum
I objected to this, of course	Metsi tre ɖe esia ŋu ya
Everything must be done right	Ele be woawɔ nu sia nu si sɔ
I will wear all kinds of clothes	Mado awu ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe
I think your way is so much better	Mesusu be wò mɔ nyo wu ale gbegbe
I'll be in early tomorrow.	Mava ge ɖe eme kaba etsɔ.
I was giving you everything	Menɔ nusianu nam wò
The whole day was wonderful.	Ŋkeke bliboa nye ŋkeke nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
That was a month ago.	Ema nye ɣleti ɖeka enye sia.
It has never been normal.	Menye nusi sɔ kpɔ o.
I looked away quickly	Meɖe ŋku ɖa kaba
There’s a lot behind there.	Nu geɖe le megbe na afima.
I need to know where you want to go	Ele be manya afi si nèdi be yeayi
Each is effective in its proper field.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe wɔa dɔ nyuie le eƒe dɔ si sɔ me.
I don’t know what the outcome will be.	Nyemenya nusi ado tso eme o.
Please explain what happened.	Taflatse ɖe nusi dzɔ la me.
But it's there all together.	Gake ele afima katã ɖekae.
Look at that now.	Kpɔ ema ɖa azɔ.
I have a new job, and a new apartment	Dɔ yeye aɖe le asinye, eye xɔ yeye hã le asinye
Too much fire.	Dzo sɔ gbɔ akpa.
I really don’t see how that could have happened.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemekpɔ alesi ema ate ŋu adzɔ hafi o.
Great.	Nyo ŋutɔ.
I came across it	Meva ke ɖe eŋu
I was waiting for my turn	Menɔ nye ɣeyiɣi lalam
I remember, this other guy	Meɖo ŋku edzi, ŋutsu bubu sia
Not in the same thing.	Menye le nu ɖeka me o.
I'm talking about the real reason.	Mele nu ƒom tso susu ŋutɔŋutɔ si tae wòle la ŋu.
There was a new section.	Akpa yeye aɖe nɔ afima.
It’s a very interesting thing.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
But this is more important.	Gake esia le vevie wu.
He was glad for that.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ɖe ema ta.
Or really that long, for that matter.	Alo le nyateƒe me la, didi nenema gbegbe, le nya ma ta.
But this is not just a stone.	Gake menye kpe aɖe koe esia nye o.
Whether it works or not doesn’t matter.	Ne ewɔ dɔ alo mewɔ dɔ o la, mehiã o.
I think he is doing really well	Mesusu be ele edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ
I took a chance to try something new today	Metsɔ mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe te nu yeye aɖe kpɔ egbea
Something happened to him.	Nane dzɔ ɖe edzi.
But he liked it.	Gake edzɔ dzi nɛ.
To some extent, this is a good thing.	Vaseɖe afi aɖe la, esia nye nu nyui aɖe.
It doesn’t matter, it will come.	Mehiã o, ava.
He will take over next month.	Axɔ dɔa le ɣleti si gbɔna me.
You’re just like him.	Èle abe eya ene.
I know you know this.	Menya be ènya esia.
I don’t know where to go.	Nyemenya afi si mayi o.
That was very exciting for me.	Ema do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
One project by each, per year.	Dɔ ɖeka to wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe dzi, ƒe sia ƒe.
I know about all these things	Menya nu tso nu siawo katã ŋu
Today, this couldn’t be more true.	Egbea la, esia mate ŋu anye nyateƒe wu ema o.
I got to keep working	Meva yi edzi le dɔ wɔm
I don’t think he’ll like it.	Nyemesusu be adzɔ dzi nɛ o.
I couldn’t believe this	Nyemete ŋu xɔ esia dzi se o
But you know what, it worked.	Gake ènya nusi, ewɔ dɔ.
They don’t have time for this.	Ɣeyiɣi mele wo si na esia o.
They are working on it.	Wole dɔ wɔm tso eŋu.
But many of them were.	Gake wo dometɔ geɖe nɔ nenema.
I was worried about death	Metsi dzi ɖe ku ŋu
I am going to ask you a simple question.	Mele nya bɔbɔe aɖe biam wò.
I glanced at him.	Metsɔ ŋku ɖe eŋu.
I will let you go now	Maɖe asi le ŋuwò azɔ
I thought he would be furious	Mesusu be ado dziku vevie
I am the same way.	Nye hã mele nenema.
That’s a good news.	Nya nyui aɖee.
Maybe he wasn’t sure.	Ðewohĩ meka ɖe edzi o.
I can get there, very easily	Mate ŋu aɖo afima, bɔbɔe ŋutɔ
I have a good reason why	Susu nyui aɖe le asinye si tae
I just wish there was someone else	Ðeko medi be ame bubu aɖe nanɔ anyi
Neither of us could get enough.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mete ŋu kpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
I know what it is now	Menya nusi wònye fifia
In my hands.	Le nye asi me.
I found a way that was a way	Mekpɔ mɔ aɖe si nye mɔ aɖe
I hope he had a long life	Mele mɔ kpɔm be agbe didi nɔ esi
They will act on it.	Woawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu.
I don’t think it is.	Nyemesusu be ele nenema o.
I know your work very well	Menya wò dɔa nyuie ŋutɔ
I recognized a couple of people	Mekpɔ ame eve aɖewo dze sii
We know each other by name.	Míenya mía nɔewo le ŋkɔ me.
I got close enough to him	Mete ɖe eŋu nyuie
We never had that in mind	Eya menɔ susu me na mí kpɔ o
I don’t think it really matters anymore	Mesusu be megale vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I was going through a difficult time	Menɔ ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe me tom
This is a tough place.	Teƒe sesẽ aɖee nye esia.
That sounds pretty good.	Ema ɖi nya nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Some people can’t stand each other.	Ame aɖewo mete ŋu nɔa te ɖe wo nɔewo nu o.
Many people thought so.	Ame geɖe susui nenema.
I want everything now	Medi nusianu fifia
Fresh eyes are essential.	Ŋku yeye le vevie ŋutɔ.
I really, really did	Mewɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ
Something about that.	Nane tso ema ŋu.
I am well aware of it.	Menya nu tso eŋu nyuie.
I did try.	Medze agbagba nyateƒe.
I am a person who stands for honor.	Menye ame si tsi tre ɖe bubu ŋu.
He doesn’t know what time it is.	Menya ɣeyiɣi si me wòle o.
I want to apologize for that	Medi be maɖe kuku ɖe ema ta
I can’t look away	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ mo dzi o
But my name still got me into the right places.	Gake nye ŋkɔ gakpɔtɔ na meva ge ɖe teƒe siwo sɔ.
It’s a good thing.	Nu nyui aɖee wònye.
We are going through it.	Míele eme tom.
Not this time or this place.	Menye ɣeyiɣi sia alo teƒe sia o.
Finally one raised his hand like a child at school.	Mlɔeba ɖeka kɔ eƒe asi ɖe dzi abe ɖevi ene le suku.
I can’t remember who sang that song	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku amesi dzi ha ma dzi o
And he felt the same way.	Eye eya hã se le eɖokui me nenema ke.
Some of us need a little time.	Mía dometɔ aɖewo hiã ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe.
I remember the first time.	Meɖo ŋku zi gbãtɔ dzi.
And it may be because no one really wants them.	Eye ate ŋu anye esi ame aɖeke medi wo ŋutɔŋutɔ o tae.
We have a lot of things that work with it.	Nu geɖe le mía si siwo wɔa dɔ kplii.
And that’s worth something.	Eye ema sɔ na nane.
But come on.	Gake va.
I needed someone who knew what they were doing	Mehiã ame aɖe si nya nu si wɔm wole
I am not doing this.	Menye nyee le esia wɔm o.
I was too surprised to speak	Mewɔ nuku nam akpa be nyemate ŋu aƒo nu o
Actually, that could work.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
I think it used to be	Mesusu be tsã
That was enough for him.	Ema sɔ gbɔ nɛ.
It felt like the right thing for him	Ewɔ nam abe nu si sɔ nɛ ene
But it didn’t grow.	Gake metsi o.
I would definitely be angry.	Anye ne mado dziku godoo.
I didn’t have time to explain	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye maɖe nu me o
It’s a new normal.	Enye nu yeye si sɔ.
I definitely do this.	Mewɔa esia godoo.
Something should have been done.	Ðe wòle be woawɔ nane hafi.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
No one is coming forward.	Ame aɖeke mele ŋgɔ gbɔna o.
I made a mistake.	Mewɔ vodada aɖe.
I don’t know whose side to take	Nyemenya amesi ƒe akpa dzi manɔ o
I haven’t felt comfortable with this in a long time	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si nyemese le ɖokuinye me be meɖe dzi ɖi le esia ŋu o
The bright side is plenty.	Akpa si me kɔ la sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
I was expecting something much more complicated than this	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na nane si sesẽ wu esia ŋutɔ
It will take too long.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
I was looking at this from a different set of eyes	Menɔ esia kpɔm tso ŋku bubu aɖe dzi
Update every two weeks or something.	Trɔ asi le eŋu kwasiɖa eve ɖesiaɖe alo nane.
I want to be like him	Medi be manɔ abe eya ene
I wonder who that could be	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be amekae ema ate ŋu anye hã
I don’t want to say anything	Nyemedi be magblɔ nya aɖeke o
That’s one of them.	Emae nye ɖeka.
I don’t want to move forward with it, yet	Nyemedi be mayi ŋgɔ kplii o, haɖe
I don’t understand that	Nyemese nya ma gɔme o
This is good for us.	Esia nyo na mí.
I told him the truth	Megblɔ nyateƒea nɛ
No one else will do it.	Ame bubu aɖeke mawɔe o.
Please comment on it.	Taflatse gblɔ nya aɖewo tso eŋu.
Maybe I already did	Ðewohĩ mewɔe xoxo
His character is very normal.	Eƒe nɔnɔme sɔ ŋutɔ.
I watched it all and tried to be happy	Mekpɔ wo katã eye medze agbagba be makpɔ dzidzɔ
You can’t hear anything more.	Màte ŋu ase naneke wu ema o.
I hope this helps!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia akpe ɖe ŋuwò!.
But yesterday's was harder.	Gake etsɔ tɔ ya sesẽ wu.
This had been going on for a long time.	Esia nɔ edzi yim ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
I have some work to do here	Dɔ aɖewo le asinye mawɔ le afisia
Everything was going so well.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie ale gbegbe.
He did a lot of good things.	Ewɔ nu nyui geɖe.
I was suddenly so hot	Mexɔ dzo zi ɖeka ale gbegbe
Everyone got to work happily.	Amesiame va dze dɔ gɔme kple dzidzɔ.
That was a little late.	Ema tsi megbe vie.
I think that’s quite extraordinary	Mesusu be ema nye nusi to vovo kura
I look forward to working with you soon	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be mawɔ dɔ kpli mi kpuie
Start something new.	Dze nu yeye aɖe gɔme.
Mayi will be fine.	Mayi nyuie.
Not in recent years.	Menye le ƒe ʋɛ siwo va yi me o.
He didn’t exactly get a shot.	Mexɔ tu aɖeke tututu o.
His leg was the only part of him that was open.	Eƒe afɔ koe nye eƒe akpa si ʋu.
I’m out of my mind.	Nye susu megale ŋunye o.
He handed her the gun in his leg.	Etsɔ tu si le eƒe afɔ me la nɛ.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I can’t remember exactly what reason he did	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku susu si tututu wòwɔ la dzi o
This is true in every other sector as well.	Esia le nenema le akpa bubu ɖesiaɖe hã me.
Clearly, this is not the case.	Edze ƒã be esia mele nenema o.
I am right behind him	Mele megbe nɛ tututu
I can’t let go of it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu o.
I was a few steps behind	Metsi megbe afɔ ʋɛ aɖewo
He didn’t do anything wrong.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
It can also take someone.	Ate ŋu axɔ ame aɖe hã.
I can do a lot with a name	Mate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe kple ŋkɔ
Anger coursed through his blood.	Dziku ƒo to eƒe ʋu me.
Another new rule.	Se yeye bubu.
I'm just not going to do it.	Ðeko nyemele ewɔ ge o.
It worked well for me though.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie nam gake.
He was a man of action.	Enye ŋutsu si wɔa dɔ.
Nothing came of it.	Naneke medo tso eme o.
Some people are not interested.	Ame aɖewo metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
He was very clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ.
At the same time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me.
I was able to turn my head enough to see	Mete ŋu trɔ ta ale gbegbe be mate ŋu akpɔ nu
No one can be above the law.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ dzi wu se la o.
I need you to tell me the truth.	Mehiã be nàgblɔ nyateƒea nam.
I took some careful steps	Meɖe afɔ aɖewo nyuie
Do it yourself.	Wò ŋutɔ wɔe.
I had heard them all before.	Mese wo katã kpɔ do ŋgɔ.
But they are very difficult to do well.	Gake wo wɔwɔ nyuie sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I don’t expect to be happy.	Nyemele mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ dzidzɔ o.
Thank you for any help.	Akpe na mi ɖe kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe ta.
Like that hadn't occurred to him yet.	Abe alesi nya ma meva susu me nɛ haɖe o ene.
I didn’t mind myself	Nye ŋutɔ meɖe fu nam o
I don’t want to call you	Nyemedi be maƒo ka na wò o
You have one month.	Ɣleti ɖeka le asiwò.
It’s too new.	Enye nu yeye akpa.
I must know something	Ele be manya nane
He wasn’t seeing anything.	Menɔ naneke kpɔm o.
I never insisted, not really.	Nyemete tɔ ɖe edzi kpɔ o, menye le nyateƒe me o.
That one shot wasn’t mine	Menye nyee tu ɖeka ma o
Me too, it’s amazing.	Nye hã, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But I can tell you this	Gake mate ŋu agblɔ nya sia na mi
It also looked pretty bad to us.	Edze nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔ hã na mí.
It’s not much of anything.	Menye naneke boo o.
What would he do.	Nukae wòawɔ.
They must be dealt with.	Ele be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu.
I think some of our people did escape though	Mesusu be míaƒe ame aɖewo si dzo nyateƒe gake
What was missing was his very life.	Nusi bu enye eƒe agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Nothing is going on.	Naneke mele edzi yim o.
But there is no obvious fire.	Gake dzo aɖeke meli si dze ƒã o.
But it is still possible.	Gake anya wɔ kokoko.
He couldn’t remember.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi o.
I remember that summer very well	Meɖo ŋku dzomeŋɔli ma dzi nyuie ŋutɔ
He was a very nice guy.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
It could be a week, it could be two.	Ate ŋu anye kwasiɖa ɖeka, ate ŋu anye eve.
Police have never released a cause of death.	Kpovitɔwo meɖe nusi gbɔ ku tso la ɖe go kpɔ o.
But he was too tired to be angry for long.	Gake ɖeɖi te eŋu ale gbegbe be mete ŋu do dziku ɣeyiɣi didi o.
That day hasn’t come yet.	Ŋkeke ma meva haɖe o.
I wonder what is going on	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae le edzi yim hã
Very little of that	Sue aɖe ŋutɔ le ema me
I would still be on my own	Anye ne manɔ nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye dzi kokoko
I tried to find you	Medze agbagba be madi wò
Save the one in the car.	Ðe esi le ʋua me la ɖe agbe.
There are many words to explain what is going on.	Nya geɖe le eme tsɔ ɖe nusi le edzi yim la me.
Not in a place like this.	Menye le teƒe si le abe esia ene o.
I don’t know anything about it, really	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o, le nyateƒe me
No one else was there.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afima o.
Now, everything is just the opposite.	Fifia, nusianu tsi tre ɖe eŋu tututu.
You can do that.	Àte ŋu awɔe nenema.
Dust can last for years.	Ke ate ŋu anɔ te sesĩe ƒe geɖe.
In two ways.	Le mɔ eve nu.
You can do what you like with them.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu si dze ŋuwò la kpli wo.
I would have known very few of them	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe menya hafi
I wish more people would do this.	Ne ɖe ame geɖe wu nawɔ esia la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
Leave me some comments.	Gblẽ nya aɖewo ɖi nam.
A city that will never be the same	Du si manɔ abe tsã ene gbeɖe o
And think of the money.	Eye bu ga la ŋu kpɔ.
I'll find out more about it, thanks	Makpɔ nu geɖe tso eŋu, akpe
This has done so.	Esia wɔe nenema.
I do know what it is	Menya nusi wònye ya
I kicked them	Metsɔ afɔ ƒo wo
I needed something new	Mehiã nu yeye aɖe
That’s where a lot of them do well.	Emae nye afisi wo dometɔ geɖe wɔa dɔ nyuie le.
If you are not there.	Ne mèle afima o.
Yet there was nothing he could do about that.	Ke hã naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ tso ema ŋu o.
I know exactly who he is	Menya amesi tututu wònye
But there is absolutely nothing.	Gake naneke kura meli o.
I can’t quite remember his name	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi tututu o
Try playing a role.	Te akpa aɖe wɔwɔ kpɔ.
I threw myself forward	Metsɔ ɖokuinye ƒu gbe ɖe ŋgɔ
The upside may not be there.	Ðewohĩ nusi le dzi yim la manɔ afima o.
I think everything should be fine	Mesusu be ele be nusianu nanɔ nyuie
I just wanted to tell you something	Ðeko medi be magblɔ nane na mi
The whole process will be done in about two weeks.	Woawɔ dɔ bliboa le abe kwasiɖa eve ene megbe.
It could be something else.	Ate ŋu anye nu bubu aɖe.
Not that I didn’t feel it at all	Menye nyemese le ɖokuinye me kura o
That seems to be true as well.	Edze abe nya ma hã nye nyateƒe ene.
I just want to go home now	Ðeko medi be mayi aƒeme fifia
I haven’t seen anything, I haven’t seen anything yet	Nyemekpɔ naneke o, nyemekpɔ naneke haɖe o
The opposite is true now.	Nusi to vovo na emae le alea fifia.
I really, really like them	Wo dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ
I can’t remember what it was	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nusi wònye dzi o
And your heart, too.	Eye wò dzi hã.
This is something else.	Esia nye nu bubu aɖe.
The issue is still very important	Nya la gakpɔtɔ le vevie ŋutɔ
This isn’t that sort of thing.	Esia menye nu ma ƒomevi o.
I think you can understand	Mesusu be àte ŋu ase egɔme
I want to go with them.	Medi be mayi kpli wo.
I couldn’t be sure which one	Nyemete ŋu ka ɖe edzi be wo dometɔ kae o
And it seems to be working.	Eye edze abe ele dɔ wɔm ene.
I need to know these things	Ele be manya nu siawo
But he could not turn back.	Gake mete ŋu trɔ ɖe megbe o.
That’s enough though.	Ema sɔ gbɔ gake.
Please, for now.	Taflatse, fifia ya.
Maybe a dress.	Ðewohĩ awu aɖee.
I am asking you for something.	Mele nane biam tso asiwò.
Maybe the same is true.	Ðewohĩ nenema ke wòle nenema.
And that’s kind of true.	Eye nya ma nye nyateƒe ƒomevi aɖe.
I needed fresh air.	Mehiã ya nyui aɖe.
You know what he wanted.	Ènya nusi dim wònɔ.
I think it’s been there for a long time	Mesusu be ele afima ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia
I never had a chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke menɔ asinye gbeɖe o.
I heard him struggle	Mese wònɔ avu wɔm
We can do better than that.	Míate ŋu awɔ nu nyuie wu ema.
I can give them two weeks	Mate ŋu ana kwasiɖa eve wo
I want to make a life together	Medi be mawɔ agbe ɖekae
It is also a matter of anger.	Enye dziku ƒe nya hã.
Busy, busy, busy.	Vovo mele ame ŋu o, vovo mele eŋu o, vovo mele eŋu o.
I think this is a good point.	Mesusu be nya nyui aɖee nye esia.
I have never been so happy in my life.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ nenema gbegbe le nye agbe me kpɔ o.
I liked him more for that	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam wu le ema ta
I felt sick, and I was so tired	Mese le ɖokuinye me be medze dɔ, eye ɖeɖi te ŋunye ale gbegbe
Use a portion of it.	Zã eƒe akpa aɖe.
I couldn’t get my mind off what had happened	Nyemete ŋu ɖe nye susu ɖa le nusi dzɔ la ŋu o
He had his gun in his hand.	Eƒe tu la nɔ esi.
Do what you enjoy.	Wɔ nu si doa dzidzɔ na wò.
I don’t know at all	Nyemenya nu kura o
No one cared about them.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le wo me o.
I just want to get to know you	Ðeko medi be manya wò
Maybe that’s what’s going on here.	Ðewohĩ emae nye nusi le edzi yim le afisia.
I knew it would upset him	Menya be ado dziku nɛ
There is too much hard work here.	Dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ sɔ gbɔ akpa le afisia.
He was focused on it.	Eƒe susu nɔ eŋu.
And yet it is there.	Eye ke hã ele afima.
That may not always be the case.	Ðewohĩ manɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi o.
I was being bothered	Menɔ fu ɖem nam
I knew he cared about me	Menya be etsɔ ɖe le eme nam
Everything is fine.	Nusianu le nyuie.
That is impossible	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o
It is small and simple.	Ele sue eye wòle bɔbɔe.
I’m not sure if he can	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be ate ŋui o
I knew it would be great	Menya be anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ
I could feel my mind working	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me be nye susu le dɔ wɔm
I'm just not sure yet.	Ðeko nyemeka ɖe edzi haɖe o.
And thus a new situation developed.	Eye to esia me la, nɔnɔme yeye aɖe va dzɔ.
But none of them did that.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
He can do it easily.	Ate ŋu awɔe bɔbɔe.
He just sat there.	Ðeko wònɔ anyi ɖe afima.
It’s something else.	Enye nu bubu aɖe.
Rest when you are tired.	Gbɔ ɖe eme ne ɖeɖi te ŋuwò.
I am not sure myself	Nye ŋutɔ nyemeka ɖe edzi o
He had to do something.	Ele be wòawɔ nane.
He never had a problem.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ eŋu kpɔ o.
From anywhere and any device.	Tso afi sia afi kple mɔ̃ ɖesiaɖe dzi.
I knew what was going on	Menya nusi nɔ edzi yim
I was sure something was wrong	Meka ɖe edzi be nane gblẽ
I felt like this would be the last time	Mese le ɖokuinye me be esia anye zi mamlɛtɔ
But it can’t be that way.	Gake mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I couldn’t get through it	Nyemete ŋu to eme o
That was his help.	Emae nye eƒe kpekpeɖeŋu.
But you are the last.	Gake wòe nye mamlɛtɔ.
I do this every morning	Mewɔa esia ŋdi sia ŋdi
That encouraged me.	Ema de dzi ƒo nam.
He can deal with anything.	Ate ŋu awɔ nu le nusianu ŋu.
I am not sure where it is	Nyemeka ɖe afi si wòle dzi o
This seems closer to the truth.	Edze abe esia te ɖe nyateƒea ŋu wu ene.
I couldn’t hold myself back.	Nyemete ŋu lé ɖokuinye ɖe te o.
Perhaps there is something better than the life we ​​have.	Ðewohĩ nane li si nyo wu agbe si le mía si.
But the truth remains.	Gake nyateƒea gakpɔtɔ li.
I'll let you go this time	Maɖe asi le ŋuwò zi sia
I really like you all	Mi katã ƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
I plan to talk to you earlier	Meɖoe be maƒo nu kpli wò do ŋgɔ
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I could have called him	Mate ŋu aƒo ka nɛ hafi
That’s a really good thing.	Ema nye nu nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I wonder how we will know where we are	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke míawɔ anya afisi míele hã
I am not one of them.	Menye wo dometɔ ɖekae menye o.
Something about him seemed familiar.	Edze abe nane si le eŋu nya nyuie ene.
I understand where your head is at	Mese afisi wò ta le gɔme
I have resisted it many times	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu zi geɖe
But it worked well.	Gake ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
Not great but not a waste of time at all.	Menye gã o gake menye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ kura o.
I have so many great memories in this house.	Meɖo ŋku nu gã geɖe dzi le aƒe sia me.
I understand this won’t be easy	Mese esia gɔme be manɔ bɔbɔe o
I can’t imagine life without her	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ agbe le susu me eya manɔmee o
He didn’t touch her.	Meka asi eŋu o.
It will go up.	Ayi dzi.
But it will be there.	Gake anɔ anyi.
A new opportunity, and a big one	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ yeye aɖe, kple gã aɖe
That really pissed me off.	Ema do dziku nam ŋutɔ.
I want everyone on my side	Medi be amesiame nanɔ nye akpa dzi
About an hour.	Anɔ abe gaƒoƒo ɖeka ene.
I hope to surprise you at home	Mekpɔ mɔ be mawɔ nuku na wò le aƒeme

Now we are in a good time.	Fifia míele ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe me.
We can only provide them.	Wo koe míate ŋu ana.
I have never felt so amazing in my life	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be mewɔ nuku nenema gbegbe le nye agbe me kpɔ o
Look, sit down.	Kpɔ ɖa, nɔ anyi.
It's just that they really are.	Ðeko wòle nyateƒe me la, wole nenema.
This is just a little bit of a problem.	Kuxi vi aɖe koe esia nye.
I wasn’t expecting that either	Nye hã menɔ mɔ kpɔm na ema o
I wish mine would live for them	Ne ɖe nye tɔ nanɔ agbe na wo la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
His face disappeared.	Eƒe mo bu.
I’m not sure what happened	Nyemeka ɖe nusi dzɔ dzi o
No one in power seems to care about that.	Edze abe ame aɖeke si le dzi ɖum metsɔ ɖeke le nya ma me o ene.
I should never have let you go	Ðe mele be maɖe asi le ŋuwò gbeɖe o hafi
I too know all the good things to say	Nye hã menya nya nyui siwo katã magblɔ
I think that’s obvious in the here and now	Mesusu be ema dze ƒã le afisia kple fifia me
I want to apologize though	Medi be maɖe kuku gake
I needed to talk to him before I went.	Ehiã be maƒo nu kplii hafi ayi.
I needed something else	Mehiã nu bubu aɖe
But that was almost obvious.	Gake ema dze ƒã kloe.
I wasn’t here like this	Menye ɖe menɔ afisia alea o
It will take time and time is precious.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi eye ɣeyiɣi xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I had a project in mind	Dɔ aɖe nɔ susu me nam
I gave them all my money	Metsɔ nye ga katã na wo
He would have had better days.	Ŋkeke siwo nyo wu la nɔ esi hafi.
Nothing is further from the truth.	Naneke mele ŋgɔ wu nyateƒea o.
I didn’t know why he was acting this way	Nyemenya nusita wònɔ nu wɔm alea o
They have less money than I do.	Ga mele wo si wu nye o.
Change your career path without a place.	Trɔ wò dɔa ƒe mɔ teƒe aɖeke manɔmee.
This is never the case in the present book.	Esia mele alea le agbalẽ si li fifia me gbeɖe o.
An appointment must be made in advance.	Ele be woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ɣeyiɣi aɖe ŋu do ŋgɔ.
It wasn’t a very bad thing	Menye nu gbegblẽ aɖe ŋutɔ
I couldn’t speak.	Nyemete ŋu ƒo nu o.
That makes a point clearly.	Ema gblɔ nya aɖe eme kɔ ƒã.
But there is something more personal.	Gake nane li si nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ wu.
I had to make a few calls	Ele be maƒo ka ʋɛ aɖewo
He will eventually contact you.	Ava do ka kpli wò mlɔeba.
You're alive.	Èle agbe.
Some kind of new thing.	Nu yeye aɖe ƒomevi.
I think you said enough	Mesusu be ègblɔ nya si sɔ gbɔ
In fact, I was very happy	Le nyateƒe me la, mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ
This cannot be done, of course.	Esia mate ŋu awɔ ya o.
He could have said that.	Ate ŋu agblɔ nya ma hafi.
That annoyed me.	Ema do dziku nam.
I never understood what that was about	Nyemese nusi ŋu nya ma ku ɖo gɔme kpɔ o
That man is now dead.	Ŋutsu ma ku azɔ.
Like there is no house.	Abe aƒe aɖeke meli o ene.
This year, they.	Le ƒe sia me la, wo...
I didn’t expect it to get there	Mekpɔ mɔ be mava ɖo afima o
You couldn’t have done it.	Màte ŋu awɔe hafi o.
Someone else made that happen	Ame bubu aɖee na ema va eme
I expected my face to say the same	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be nye mo hã agblɔ nya ma ke
That tells us why something happened.	Emae na míenya nusita nane dzɔ.
He couldn’t go on like this.	Mete ŋu yi edzi alea o.
I just want to be there for you	Ðeko medi be manɔ afima na mi
I have it in my hands.	Ele asinye.
This just seems to make sense.	Edze abe susu le nya sia me ko ene.
There is nothing about itself.	Naneke mele eɖokui ŋu o.
She has no husband.	Ŋutsu aɖeke mele esi o.
Nothing matters yet.	Naneke megale vevie haɖe o.
Where my work fits in overall.	Afisi nye dɔa sɔ le le bliboa me.
Just something.	Nu aɖe ko.
I tried a lot of other things	Mete nu bubu geɖe kpɔ
I want to tell you something	Medi be magblɔ nane na mi
But I let that go.	Gake meɖe asi le nya ma ŋu.
I hope you know what you just did	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ènya nu si nèwɔ teti koe nye ema
I had no idea what he was doing there	Nyemenya nusi wɔm wònɔ le afima o
I could go on for hours.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi gaƒoƒo geɖe.
I said nothing is illegal	Megblɔ be naneke meli si ŋu se meɖe mɔ ɖo o
I think you have as good a chance as anyone	Mesusu be mɔnukpɔkpɔ nyui aɖe le asiwò abe amesiame ene
He couldn't pick up anything more.	Mete ŋu fɔ naneke wu ema o.
They are there now.	Wole afima fifia.
And the car itself.	Eye ʋua ŋutɔ hã.
I couldn’t have done it without your work.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe ne menye wò dɔ o.
He won’t make any money on it.	Makpɔ ga aɖeke le eŋu o.
I don’t know what to do about it.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso eŋu o.
I need to know the truth	Ele be manya nyateƒea
Touch his eyes.	Ka asi eƒe ŋku ŋu.
Another suddenly occurred to him	Bubu aɖe va susu me nɛ zi ɖeka
His heart stopped a little.	Eƒe dzi tɔ vie.
I should have fought harder too	Ðe wòle be nye hã mawɔ avu sesĩe wu hafi
I can’t remember anything about last night	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku naneke dzi le zã si va yi ŋu o
I needed to go with them	Ehiã be mayi kpli wo
That is when it starts.	Emae nye ne edze egɔme.
He needed another set of eyes to witness this.	Ehiã ŋku bubu be wòate ŋu akpɔ esia teƒe.
I think it’s possible	Mesusu be anya wɔ
The, the, the!.	Di, di, di!.
It's quite something, really.	Enye nane ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
A hand reached out to him	Asi aɖe do asi ɖe eŋu
I wonder if he is okay	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe wòle nyuie hã
Any help would be appreciated.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe aɖe vi.
I think he would want that too	Mesusu be eya hã adi nenema
But there are some things we don’t know.	Gake nu aɖewo li siwo míenya o.
It’s as simple as that.	Ele bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
I can’t speak at all.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu kura o.
Everything is different now.	Nusianu to vovo fifia.
I must be doing something right	Anɔ eme be mele nane wɔm nyuie
It can only be one way.	Mɔ ɖeka koe ate ŋu anye.
In fact, he was a very nice person.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye ame nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
It was a good day.	Enye ŋkeke nyui aɖe.
I have done this many times	Mewɔ esia zi geɖe
I understand why he has to do this	Mese nusita wòle be wòawɔ esia gɔme
I think there are several reasons for this	Mesusu be susu geɖe li siwo tae wòle alea ɖo
I had another job to do	Dɔ bubu aɖe hã nɔ asinye mawɔ
In the end, he said nothing.	Mlɔeba la, megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
He didn't want any of them on his mind right now.	Medi be wo dometɔ aɖeke nanɔ yeƒe susu me fifia o.
He hadn’t felt this way in a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si mese le eɖokui me alea o.
But it’s not because of him.	Gake menye eya tae o.
I can’t keep up with it at all	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ɖe edzi kura o
I just have to go a little further	Ele be mayi ŋgɔ vie ko
I would give up anything and everything	Maɖe asi le nusianu kple nusianu ŋu
I told myself you’re better off without me	Megblɔ na ɖokuinye be nye manɔmee la, wò nyo wu
He is going to do some work.	Ele dɔ aɖewo wɔwɔ ge.
I want them to be implemented.	Medi be woawɔ wo dzi.
Maybe too personal.	Ðewohĩ ame ŋutɔ ƒe nya akpa.
I wasn’t alone in this	Menye nye ɖeka koe nɔ esia me o
Ask anyone who has been here that long, or longer.	Bia amesiame si nɔ afisia ɣeyiɣi didi ma, alo esi wu nenema.
I didn’t mean to do it.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔe o.
That’s a big loss.	Ema nye nu gã aɖe si bu.
I liked him very, very much	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ
I am with them in that work	Mele wo gbɔ le dɔ ma me
I want to test that	Medi be mado nya ma kpɔ
I shape it.	Mewɔa nɔnɔme nɛ.
People have met.	Amewo do go.
This project took us months and months.	Dɔ sia wɔwɔ xɔ ɣleti kple ɣleti geɖe na mí.
The big, angry part of me wants that.	Nye akpa gã si le dziku dom la di nenema.
In every year.	Le ƒe ɖesiaɖe me.
I was very interested in it	Metsɔ ɖe le eme ŋutɔ
This is just not working.	Ðeko esia mele dɔ wɔm o.
I never expected it to be easy	Nyemekpɔ mɔ gbeɖe be anɔ bɔbɔe o
Have an idea of ​​how you are, how you are.	Na susu aɖe nanɔ asiwò le alesi nèle, alesi nèle ŋu.
There is nothing anyone can do.	Naneke meli ame aɖeke ate ŋu awɔ o.
Where are you?.	Afikae nèle?.
I'll do it first thing tomorrow morning	Mawɔe gbãtɔ etsɔ ŋdi
I think it always will be	Mesusu be anɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi
I know someone who knows this person.	Menya ame aɖe si nya ame sia.
I was really looking for something similar.	Menɔ nane si sɔ kple esia dim ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I want to express my opinion	Medi be magblɔ nye susu
We are a machine.	Míenye mɔ̃ aɖe.
A fire shot out from behind	Dzo aɖe do tso megbe
He wasn’t alone.	Menye eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi o.
A lot started here.	Nu geɖe dze egɔme le afisia.
I need someone decent to talk to from the police	Mehiã ame aɖe si dze ame ŋu be maƒo nu na tso kpovitɔwo gbɔ
A fraction of a life	Agbe aɖe ƒe akpa sue aɖe
I also remember it of course	Meɖo ŋku edzi hã nyateƒe
And it’s very watery.	Eye tsi le eme ŋutɔ.
I thought it was a little weird	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku vie
They are making money.	Wole ga kpɔm.
I think we can be great together	Mesusu be míate ŋu anye gã ɖekae
But not the one that matters.	Gake menye esi le vevie o.
It didn’t bother me in a way	Meɖe fu nam le mɔ aɖe nu o
I think it will appeal to some.	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na ame aɖewo.
It wasn’t doing well.	Menɔ edzi dzem nyuie o.
I can’t say that about many people	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma le ame geɖe ŋu o
I told myself out loud	Megblɔ na ɖokuinye sesĩe be

I need to have help.	Ele be kpekpeɖeŋu nanɔ asinye.
I’m glad everything went well	Edzɔ dzi nam be nusianu yi edzi nyuie
So was everyone else.	Nenema ke ame sia ame hã nɔ.
I don’t understand that	Nyemese nya ma gɔme o
I couldn’t be happier	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ wu ema o
I don’t really know anything about this.	Nyemenya naneke tso esia ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I can’t get enough of it	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ eƒe akpa si sɔ gbɔ akpa o
And that seems like a logical outcome.	Eye edze abe ema ado tso eme si me susu le ene.
A really nice guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I needed a good reason to sit	Mehiã susu nyui aɖe si me manɔ anyi ɖo
I don’t need to explain myself.	Mehiã be maɖe ɖokuinye me o.
There were so many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi.
I got what you deserved	Mexɔ nusi dze na wò
Nothing took anything away from him.	Naneke mexɔ naneke le esi o.
Mava 'va o.	Mava 'va o.
I can’t do anything about that	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso ema ŋu o
You can combine them.	Àte ŋu aƒo wo nu ƒu.
This is going to be devastating.	Esia le nu gblẽ ge.
Maybe it would be a good thing.	Ðewohĩ anye nu nyui aɖe.
I bought that place with my own money	Metsɔ nye ŋutɔ nye ga ƒle teƒe ma
Thousands and thousands of people.	Ame akpe geɖe kple akpe geɖe.
Start again, somewhere else.	Dze egɔme ake, le teƒe bubu aɖe.
That would have been too easy.	Ema anɔ bɔbɔe akpa hafi.
We can do it.	Míate ŋu awɔe.
I could have finished there	Mate ŋu awu enu le afima hafi
I think you have a point there	Mesusu be nya aɖe le asiwò le afima
Not an easy death.	Menye ku bɔbɔe o.
And we liked what he did.	Eye nu si wòwɔ la dze mía ŋu.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Ðewohĩ vi aɖe, ɖewohĩ geɖe ŋutɔ.
He started to come back.	Edze egɔme trɔ gbɔ.

I have no real problem with this.	Kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke mele ŋunye le esia ŋu o.
I felt it too.	Nye hã mese le ɖokuinye me.
I don’t really want to talk to him right now	Nyemedi ŋutɔŋutɔ be maƒo nu kplii fifia o
I thought I felt close to you	Mesusu be mese le ɖokuinye me be te ɖe ŋuwò
I sent it inside.	Meɖoe ɖe eme.
I wasn’t happy about this	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe esia ŋu o
I was going to a different school, though.	Menɔ suku bubu aɖe yim, ke hã,
On his head.	Le eƒe ta dzi.
I never heard anything about that	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso nya ma ŋu kpɔ o
Person.	Ame.
I would pretend to be nervous	Mawɔ abe ɖe metsi dzodzodzoe ene
I told them the truth.	Megblɔ nyateƒea na wo.
That’s very interesting.	Ema doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
I am on my way back now	Mele mɔ dzi trɔ gbɔ fifia
I guess it doesn’t matter anyway	Mesusu be mele vevie o le mɔ sia mɔ nu
He doesn’t know, and he never will.	Menya o, eye mawɔe hã gbeɖe o.
We had a very small house there.	Aƒe sue aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ mía si le afima.
But in a more abstract way	Gake le mɔ si me susu mele o nu wu nu
His dog didn’t care.	Eƒe avu la metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
I liked that about a guy	Ema dzɔ dzi nam le ŋutsu aɖe ŋu
And that’s what ultimately matters.	Eye emae nye nusi le vevie mlɔeba.
I wondered if this was normal for him	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe esia nye nusi sɔ nɛ hã
There was something odd about him.	Nane si mewɔ nuku o nɔ eŋu.
And you know what that means.	Eye ènya nusi ema fia.
I must have missed something	Nane anya to ŋunye
A cat came out	Ame aɖe si nye avu aɖe do go
I just couldn’t put two and two together.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ƒo eve kple eve nu ƒu o.

This was very useful.	Esia ɖe vi ŋutɔ.

You probably know that too.	Ðewohĩ ènya ema hã.

I need to know his name	Ele be manya eƒe ŋkɔ
There are some reasons why.	Susu aɖewo li siwo tae.
I saw that another child was running in our direction	Mekpɔ be ɖevi bubu aɖe hã nɔ du dzi le míaƒe mɔ dzi
I got them after he died.	Mexɔ wo le eƒe ku megbe.
There is nothing in it for them.	Naneke mele eme na wo o.
In his hands.	Le eƒe asi me.
I felt at home there with them	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mele aƒeme le afima kpli wo
No one could see any of them.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu kpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
It will help us.	Akpe ɖe mía ŋu.

I knew we could make it work.	Menya be míate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ.
I thrust my sword into his throat	Metsɔ nye yi de eƒe kɔ me

You’re a lot like me.	Èle abe nye ene ŋutɔ.

This, of course, is impossible.	Esia ya mate ŋu awɔ o.

So many years and years.	Ƒe kple ƒe geɖe ale gbegbe.
It didn’t really surprise me	Mewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔŋutɔ o
But one thing is clear.	Gake nu ɖeka me kɔ.

He did not know how to react to this.	Menya alesi wòawɔ nu ɖe ​​esia ŋui o.
I just wanted to let go	Ðeko medi be maɖe asi le eŋu
I had no desire to talk to anyone	Didi aɖeke menɔ menye be maƒo nu kple ame aɖeke o
He didn’t do anything about it.	Mewɔ naneke le eŋu o.

I think there are two things	Mesusu be nu eve aɖewo li

I had reasons for not wanting to get involved	Susu aɖewo nɔ asinye si ta nyemedi be maƒo ɖokuinye ɖe eme o

This is not a problem in itself.	Esia menye kuxi le eɖokui si o.

You can easily do this at home.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia bɔbɔe le aƒeme.
It was a first for all of us.	Enye zi gbãtɔ na mí katã.
I thought they were on me.	Mesusu be wole dzinye.
I certainly hoped he would	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm godoo be awɔe nenema
I should never have let you go	Ðe mele be maɖe asi le wò ŋu gbeɖe o hafi
But this was not what he expected.	Gake esia menɔ abe alesi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ ene o.
I need you to tell me something	Mehiã be nàgblɔ nya aɖe nam
It’s been a while.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
Kind of at a loss right now.	Ƒomevi aɖe le nusi bu me fifia.
It’s just the first one.	Gbãtɔ koe wònye.
He also did a lot of things right.	Ewɔ nu geɖe hã nyuie.
There was never anything personal in it, from my side.	Ame ŋutɔ ƒe naneke menɔ eme kpɔ o, tso nye akpa dzi.
I was the one who did the wrong thing	Nyee nye ame si wɔ nu gbegblẽ
It could have been anywhere.	Ate ŋu anɔ afi sia afi hafi.
You already said that.	Ègblɔ nya ma xoxo.
None of them appear in this section.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke medze le akpa sia o.
Thank you for the help.	Akpe na mi ɖe kpekpeɖeŋu ta.
And the car is beautiful.	Eye ʋua hã nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
Obviously, no one can know about us.	Edze ƒã be ame aɖeke mate ŋu anya nu tso mía ŋu o.
Some things are going to be very different.	Nu aɖewo ava to vovo kura.
One more thing, too.	Nu ɖeka bubu hã.
We had to try all sorts of things.	Ele be míate nu ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe kpɔ.
Exactly where, we don’t know yet.	Afi si tututu wòle la, míenya haɖe o.
Water.	Tsi.
I also had some work to do	Dɔ aɖewo hã nɔ asinye mawɔ
I can do that, you know	Mate ŋu awɔe nenema, ènya
That sounds pretty good.	Ema ɖi nya nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
' '.	' '.
I got sick of it and got sick of it.	Medze dɔ le eŋu eye medze dɔ le eŋu.
I needed someone.	Mehiã ame aɖe.
I was looking forward to that	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na ema vevie
And just about everything.	Eye nusianu ko.
I have to apologize if anything happens to her.	Ele be maɖe kuku ne nane dzɔ ɖe edzi.
I have to do it myself	Ele be nye ŋutɔ mawɔe
A man came out.	Ŋutsu aɖe do go.
I just can’t remember	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi o
That is very difficult.	Ema sesẽ ŋutɔ.
People treated him really well	Amewo wɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ
But there may have been two of them.	Gake ɖewohĩ wo dometɔ eve nɔ anyi.
I can understand part of the logic	Mate ŋu ase susu si le eme ƒe akpa aɖe gɔme
It really didn’t bother me too much	Le nyateƒe me la, meɖe fu nam akpa o
Death is involved.	Ku le eme.
I told him that was a good idea	Megblɔ nɛ be susu nyui aɖee nye ema
That’s why he’s here.	Esia tae wòle afisia.
I got to know them better.	Meva nya wo nyuie wu.
I know how hard things are for you	Menya alesi nuwo sesẽ na wòe
He will let go of death.	Aɖe asi le ku ŋu.
Not in the near future at least.	Menye le etsɔ si gbɔna kpuie ya teti me o.
He seemed a little less tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi mete eŋu vie o ene.
That’s what happened here.	Emae nye nusi dzɔ le afisia.
Pure.	Si me kɔ.
A big deal actually.	Nya gã aɖee le nyateƒe me.
My hand fell off.	Nye asi ge dze anyi.
I had a nice house and a good job	Aƒe nyui aɖe nɔ asinye eye mewɔ dɔ nyuie
That surprised me a bit.	Ema wɔ nuku nam vie.
At work, do what you enjoy.	Le dɔ me la, wɔ nu si doa dzidzɔ na wò.
I know this is true	Menya be nya sia nye nyateƒe
I said the first thing that came to mind	Megblɔ nya gbãtɔ si va susu me nam
That tells you something.	Ema gblɔ nane na wò.
I'm talking myself into something here	Mele nu ƒom na ɖokuinye ɖe nane me le afisia
The money is badly needed	Ga la hiã vevie
He was never too sure about that.	Meka ɖe nya ma dzi akpa gbeɖe o.
This is exciting.	Esia doa dzidzɔ na ame.
You know something that can help us.	Ènya nane si ate ŋu akpe ɖe mía ŋu.
It’s not there either.	Mele afima hã o.
I didn’t like that attitude very much	Nɔnɔme ma medze ŋunye boo o
But in this now more.	Gake le esia me fifia wu.
None of them are true.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
He didn’t answer her.	Meɖo eŋu nɛ o.
Like, no one cares what happens.	Abe, ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le nusi adzɔ me o ene.
I can’t do it alone	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔe o
I don’t want anything to do with it	Nyemedi be naneke nawɔ ɖeka kplii o
Now he seems to be here.	Fifia edze abe ɖe wòle afisia ene.
Many of them don’t exist.	Wo dometɔ geɖe meli o.
I did something for you	Mewɔ nane na wò
Last year is over.	Ƒe si va yi wu enu.
I knew something was going on	Menya be nane le edzi yim
It was a great deal of fun.	Enye dzidzɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But keep things in order	Gake na nuwo nanɔ nyuie
I was curious about it	Medi vevie be manya nu tso eŋu
None of them were doing that.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ nu ma wɔm o.
I’ve never seen this side of it	Nyemekpɔ eƒe akpa sia kpɔ o
I am sure there will be many like me	Meka ɖe edzi be ame geɖe abe nye ene anɔ anyi
There is nothing problematic about this.	Naneke meli si nye kuxi le esia ŋu o.
But that was amazing.	Gake ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Another struck the back of his neck.	Bubu hã ƒo eƒe kɔ ƒe megbe.
I have done this before.	Mewɔ esia do ŋgɔ.
There is simply no other word for it.	Ðeko nya bubu aɖeke meli na esia o.
I know about these things	Menya nu tso nu siawo ŋu
I should have been there.	Ðe wòle be manɔ afima hafi.
A mistake is a mistake.	Vodada nye vodada.
But I think he will listen to me now	Gake mesusu be aɖo tom fifia ya
Many people have seen me	Ame geɖe kpɔm
Do this on the grass.	Wɔ esia le gbe dzi.
It’s not easy at work.	Mele bɔbɔe le dɔme o.
I am enjoying myself very much.	Mele dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔ.
I just ask a nice guy for one thing	Ðeko mebiaa nu ɖeka tso ŋutsu nyui aɖe si
He was very interested.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme ŋutɔ.
I can’t tell you much more right now	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe wu na wò fifia o
He didn’t know what day it was.	Menya ŋkeke si dzi wònye o.
He wasn’t the only one to make his money.	Menye eya ɖeka koe kpɔ eƒe ga o.
I just want that one	Ðeko medi be ɖeka ma
I’m not going to head	Nyemele ta yim o
But you don’t know to continue.	Gake mènya be yeayi edzi o.
This ended badly.	Esia wu enu gbegblẽ.
Or tell me what works.	Alo gblɔ nusi wɔa dɔ nam.
If your voice is tired, rest.	Ne ɖeɖi te wò gbe ŋu la, ke gbɔ ɖe eme.
I am not sure where it is.	Nyemeka ɖe afi si wòle dzi o.
I’m so glad I didn’t have to try	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mehiã be mate kpɔ o
It worked for me for a long time.	Ewɔ dɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe nam.
He is going to use his voice.	Ele eƒe gbe zã ge.
I didn’t expect it to be that close	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be wòate ɖe ame ŋu nenema gbegbe o
He couldn’t see at all.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu kura o.
I know exactly who he is	Menya amesi tututu wònye
He probably will, too.	Anɔ eme be awɔe nenema hã.
I have a job for you	Dɔ aɖe le asinye na wò
My heart is in my throat.	Nye dzi le nye kɔ me.
A really simple thing	Nu bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ
He did not know what would happen in the coming days.	Menya nusi ava dzɔ le ŋkeke siwo gbɔna me o.
Which is not what I want.	Nusi menye nusi medi o.
A man entered my room	Ŋutsu aɖe ge ɖe nye xɔ me
I know you don’t want that either	Menya be wò hã mèdi nenema o
We can do some things that you will enjoy.	Míate ŋu awɔ nu aɖewo siwo ado dzidzɔ na wò.
That shouldn’t be a big surprise.	Mele be ema nawɔ nuku na ame gã aɖeke o.
He is so alone.	Eya ɖeka koe li ale gbegbe.
I was able to work without hands	Mete ŋu wɔ dɔ asi manɔmee
I know something we can do	Menya nane si míate ŋu awɔ
However, you can’t do it.	Ke hã, màte ŋu awɔe o.
I don’t know what to do with it	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ kplii o
I don’t want to wait	Nyemedi be makpɔ mɔ o
I just do whatever is necessary at this point	Ðeko mewɔa nusianu si hiã le ɣeyiɣi sia me
That definitely came before.	Ema va do ŋgɔ godoo.
I got ahead of myself	Medo ŋgɔ na ɖokuinye
Like there is no tomorrow.	Abe etsɔ aɖeke meli o ene.
You have to say something about it.	Ele be nàgblɔ nya aɖe tso eŋu.
I couldn’t be a good kid.	Nyemete ŋu nye vi nyui o.
I believe you and its not in your head	Mexɔ wò dzi se eye eƒe menye le wò ta me o
Yet there can be no other way.	Ke hã mɔ bubu aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
He did what he had to do.	Ewɔ nu si wòle be wòawɔ.
But he didn’t listen.	Gake meɖo to o.
I just need some fresh air	Ðeko mehiã ya nyui aɖe
I have my car here	Nye ʋu le asinye le afisia
That sounds good for now.	Ema ɖi nu nyui aɖe na fifia.
I couldn’t help myself.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe ɖokuinye nu o.
I wondered who he was	Mebia ɖokuinye be amekae wònye hã
Not for you and not for anyone.	Menye na wò eye menye na ame aɖeke o.
I almost did that	Mewɔ ema kloe
But I can't seem to make it work.	Gake edze abe nyemate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ o ene.
For many good reasons.	Susu nyui geɖe tae.
I thought he was talking to me	Mesusu be ele nu ƒom nam
And nothing seems to work.	Eye edze abe naneke mewɔa dɔ o ene.
I have done this before.	Mewɔ esia do ŋgɔ.
I congratulated him.	Medo dzidzɔ nɛ.
I do everything and work hard when there is work.	Mewɔa nusianu eye mewɔa dɔ sesĩe ne dɔ li.
Some people got mad at me.	Ame aɖewo va do dziku ɖe ŋunye.
I should have told you about them	Ðe wòle be magblɔ wo ŋu nya na mi hafi
It could have been more helpful than it was.	Ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu wu alesi wònɔ hafi.
I want to meet a really nice guy	Medi be mado go ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ
I’ve been there too	Nye hã menɔ afima kpɔ
I understand, I feel angry, too	Mese egɔme, mese le ɖokuinye me be dziku, nye hã
That made him happy.	Ema do dzidzɔ nɛ.
It could also be his life.	Ate ŋu anye eƒe agbe hã.
I decided to do just that	Meɖoe be mawɔ nu ma tututu
I had to work late	Ele be mawɔ dɔ le dɔ si tsi megbe
Yet, this must be done.	Ke hã ele be woawɔ esia.
I stood on one hand.	Metsi tre ɖe asi ɖeka dzi.
One doesn’t really need that.	Ame mehiã ema ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I should be doing that now.	Ele be manɔ ema wɔm fifia.
I was the only one.	Nye ɖeka koe nye ema.
I never heard anything about it	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso eŋu kpɔ o
I did a few songs in school	Mewɔ ha ʋɛ aɖewo le suku
He is in a private school.	Ele suku aɖe si menye ame ŋutɔ tɔ o me.
They must be implemented.	Ele be woawɔ wo dzi.
That’s a lot of it.	Ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
I really felt out of place	Mese le ɖokuinye me ŋutɔŋutɔ be nyemele teƒe aɖeke o
I have to apologize.	Ele be maɖe kuku.
Which is true, you can.	Nusi nye nyateƒe, àte ŋui.
This is also a lie	Esia hã nye alakpa
He had never noticed that quality in her.	Mekpɔ nɔnɔme ma dze sii le eŋu kpɔ o.
Tell me they’re here.	Gblɔ nam be wole afisia.
A difficult issue is the tongue	Nya sesẽ aɖee nye aɖe
I also translated a lot.	Meɖe nu geɖe hã gɔme.
This project is harder than any of that.	Dɔ sia wɔwɔ sesẽ wu ema dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
I took a step forward	Meɖe afɔ ɖeka yi ŋgɔ
My face was right next to her mouth.	Nye mo nɔ eƒe nu gbɔ tututu.
Somewhere in there.	Le afi aɖe le afima.
Obviously not in my own home.	Edze ƒã be menye le nye ŋutɔ nye aƒeme o.
But it is no longer the case.	Gake megale nenema o.
I don’t know if he felt the same way	Nyemenya nenye be eya hã se le eɖokui me nenema ke o
It just didn’t last too long for some reason.	Ðeko menɔ anyi eteƒe didi akpa o le susu aɖewo ta.
I’m glad I know people who do	Edzɔ dzi nam be menya ame siwo wɔa esia
I will do anything.	Mawɔ nusianu.
There are one and two rooms.	Xɔ ɖeka kple eve le afima.
I’ve never felt this way about anyone else	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me alea ɖe ame bubu aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o
I really like this idea.	Susu sia dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
But neither of us was really comfortable.	Gake mía dometɔ aɖeke meɖe dzi ɖi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Like it doesn’t really exist.	Abe ɖe meli ŋutɔŋutɔ o ene.
A bullet pressed to his ear	Tu aɖe te ɖe eƒe to ŋu
I had four more shots to let go	Tu ene bubu nɔ asinye maɖe asi le
But I wanted something different for my life	Gake medi be nane si to vovo na nye agbe
We are all trying.	Mí katã míele agbagba dzem.
None of them ever made it home.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mete ŋu yi aƒe gbeɖe o.
I have a long day today	Ŋkeke didi aɖe le asinye egbea
Everyone had a top night	Zã aɖe si le ŋgɔ wu la nɔ amesiame si
In many ways, he did a lot of good.	Le mɔ geɖe nu la, ewɔ nu nyui geɖe.
I can’t stand myself	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe ɖokuinye nu o
Tell me a little about that.	Gblɔ nya ma ŋu nya vi aɖe nam.
He can always listen.	Ate ŋu aɖo to ɣesiaɣi.
I was talking to myself	Menɔ nu ƒom na ɖokuinye
I wondered if he was doing the same thing	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe wòle nu ma ke wɔm hã
I want to know how it is	Medi be manya ale si wòle
But not for very long.	Gake menye ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ o.
He'll tell me if it's wet.	Agblɔ nam ne tsi le eŋu.
And we still have each other.	Eye mía nɔewo gakpɔtɔ le mía dome.
I had to talk to him about something	Ele nam be maƒo nu tso nane ŋu nɛ
Besides, maybe that was his plan.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe esia ŋu la, ɖewohĩ emae nye eƒe ɖoɖo.
But he didn’t understand.	Gake mese egɔme o.
I said with a hard face	Megblɔ kple mo sesẽ
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Where is it?.	Afikae wòle?.
It seems to be the same.	Edze abe nenema ke wòle ene.
This is one of the most extreme cases.	Esia nye nɔnɔme siwo gbɔ eme wu la dometɔ ɖeka.
I can definitely provide everything you want to see	Mate ŋu ana nusianu si nèdi be yeakpɔ la godoo
That’s the simple truth of it.	Emae nye nyateƒe bɔbɔe si le eme.
I was hoping that was all	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be ema koe nye ema
There are two of them.	Wo dometɔ eve li.
Finally, the car came out.	Mlɔeba la, ʋua do.
I’ve seen dogs die for their owners	Mekpɔ avu siwo ku ɖe wo tɔ ŋu kpɔ
Take things one step at a time.	Ðe nuwo ɖe afɔ ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
It’s just a matter of getting the job done.	Dɔa wɔwɔ ƒe nya koe wònye.
I need another, and another and another.	Mehiã bubu, kple bubu kple bubu.
Nothing came out of them.	Naneke medo tso wo me o.
No one would do that here.	Ame aɖeke mawɔe nenema le afisia o.
I have to find my voice	Ele be madi nye gbe
I always wondered what that was	Mebiaa ɖokuinye ɣesiaɣi be nukae nye ema hã
Maybe you can understand.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu ase egɔme.
I worry about them, you know	Metsi dzi ɖe wo ŋu, ènya
He can do a lot for her.	Ate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe nɛ.
A small part of it went inside	Eƒe akpa sue aɖe ge ɖe eme
I have already tried	Mete kpɔ xoxo
No one seemed to be in the house.	Edze abe ame aɖeke menɔ aƒea me o ene.
He couldn’t get inside.	Mete ŋu ge ɖe eme o.
It’s a difficult situation for you.	Enye nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe na wò.
He won’t do that.	Mawɔe nenema o.
I get to ride a fast horse	Meva doa sɔ si le du dzi sesĩe
Maybe a book would help, is.	Ðewohĩ agbalẽ aɖe akpe ɖe ame ŋu, enye.
This worried me.	Esia tsi dzi nam.
I really want to know where this is going to go	Medi vevie be manya afi si esia ayi
I would hope not but who knows	Makpɔ mɔ be mawɔe o gake amekae nya
I want things my own way	Medi nuwo le nye ŋutɔ nye mɔ nu
Or maybe it won’t.	Alo ɖewohĩ mawɔe nenema o.
I didn’t understand it all	Nyemese wo katã gɔme o
We can see that here.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ema le afisia.
There we like very little.	Le afima la, nu sue aɖe koe dzɔa dzi na mí.
Not in the past.	Menye le ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me o.
But we have what we have.	Gake nu si le mía si la le mía si.
Otherwise, it doesn’t.	Ne menye nenema o la, mewɔe nenema o.
It started off well.	Edze egɔme nyuie.
I deserve help too	Medze na kpekpeɖeŋu nam hã
A different millennium	Ƒe akpe ɖeka si to vovo
I told you it was a great shot	Megblɔ na mi be enye tu gã aɖe
Maybe he will meet.	Ðewohĩ ado go.
I'd say that's pretty much it.	Magblɔ be nya ma sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
Do it for us, you know.	Wɔe na mí, ènya.
Trust me on this one.	Ka ɖe dzinye le nu ɖeka sia ŋu.
On that side of the spectrum.	Le akpa ma dzi.
I recognized it all too well	Mekpɔ wo katã dze sii nyuie akpa

From morning till night.	Tso ŋdi vaseɖe zã me.
I have to admire him for that	Ele be makpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu le ema ta
I told him that.	Megblɔ nɛ nenema.
But he didn’t know.	Gake menya o.
I am convinced of that	Meka ɖe nya ma dzi
There is nothing like this.	Naneke meli si le abe esia ene o.
I had to be on board	Ele be nye hã manɔ ʋua me
I stepped closer	Meɖe afɔ ɖe eŋu wu
That’s good for him.	Ema nyo nɛ.
I had no job at all	Dɔ aɖeke menɔ asinye kura o
Or always, for that matter.	Alo ɣesiaɣi, le nya ma ta.
I knew what he was planning	Menya nusi ŋu wòle ɖoɖo wɔm ɖo
It usually doesn’t work that way.	Zi geɖe la, mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
But there was no one there.	Gake ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
I enjoyed it.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu.
But, rest easy.	Gake, gbɔ ɖe eme bɔbɔe.
But there is something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã li.
But it had everything in it.	Gake nusianu si le eme la nɔ eme.
I just had to put up with it, but this was different	Ðeko wòle be mado dzi, gake esia to vovo
I think it’s very, very likely.	Mesusu be anɔ eme ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
I wanted more than that	Medi nu geɖe wu ema
I am all nervous now	Nye katã metsi dzodzodzoe fifia
Or anything like that.	Alo nusianu si le abe ema ene.
The blood.	Ʋua.
I headed for them	Meɖo ta wo gbɔ
I didn’t expect it, really	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na o, le nyateƒe me
But it wasn’t like that.	Gake menɔ nenema o.
And it will still get attention.	Eye amewo ƒe susu anɔ eŋu kokoko.
It didn’t bother them.	Meɖe fu na wo o.
Please, help me out.	Meɖe kuku, kpe ɖe ŋunye.
He could not have been a happy man.	Mate ŋu anye ŋutsu si kpɔa dzidzɔ hafi o.
That would be something.	Ema anye nane.
He never did anything wrong to anyone.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke ɖe ame aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o.
I did it that way.	Mewɔe nenema.
He saw nothing there.	Mekpɔ naneke le afima o.
It was a pleasure to work with him.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be mewɔ dɔ kplii.
I am yours.	Nyee nye wò tɔ.
See what’s blowing in there.	Kpɔ nusi le ya ƒom le afima ɖa.
I remember that vividly.	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi nyuie.
I decided to try	Meɖoe be mate kpɔ
He will take care of them.	Akpɔ wo dzi.
I did care for him, actually	Metsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ nyateƒe, le nyateƒe me
More men ahead.	Ŋutsu geɖe wu le ŋgɔ.
Clearly, he has his people in mind.	Edze ƒã be eƒe amewo le susu me nɛ.
We have two cars there now.	Ʋu eve le mía si le afima fifia.
I still have school in the morning	Suku gakpɔtɔ le asinye le ŋdi me
I connected with some great people.	Medo ka kple ame gã aɖewo.
He just wasn’t among them.	Ðeko menɔ wo dome o.
I had nothing on me.	Naneke menɔ ŋunye o.
I'll be right here with you.	Manɔ afisia tututu kpli wò.
Just the thing.	Nu la koe.
I will stay for a year	Manɔ anyi ƒe ɖeka
I knew something was seriously wrong	Menya be nane gblẽ vevie
This takes time.	Esia bia ɣeyiɣi.
I am not sure of his state of mind.	Nyemeka ɖe eƒe susu ƒe nɔnɔme dzi o.
I am a non-personal person	Nyee nye ame si menye ame ŋutɔ tɔ o
I must have heard them at night	Anɔ eme be mese wo le zã me
There were many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe nɔ anyi.
Think of this as a new issue.	Bu esia be enye nya yeye aɖe.
But it worked well.	Gake ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
I know it’s hard	Menya be eƒe sesẽ
There will be something.	Nane anɔ anyi.

I haven’t found who did it yet	Nyemekpɔ amesi wɔe haɖe o
I knew he was one of us	Menya be mía dometɔ ɖekae wònye
Let go of your attitude.	Ðe asi le wò nɔnɔme ŋu.

There have been a few of them.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ anyi kpɔ.
But not many lived together.	Gake ame geɖe menɔ anyi ɖekae o.
I recognized his voice	Mekpɔ eƒe gbe dze sii
Couldn't see how any of that would ever benefit you.	Mete ŋu kpɔ alesi ema dometɔ aɖeke aɖe vi na wò gbeɖe o.
This is something new to me.	Esia nye nu yeye nam.
I actually made a plan to act	Mewɔ ɖoɖo aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ be mawɔ nu
Maybe with food.	Ðewohĩ kple nuɖuɖu.
I don’t think it matters now	Mesusu be mehiã fifia o
I could almost feel him searching her mind	Mese le ɖokuinye me kloe be ele eƒe susu me dim
I couldn’t get pregnant.	Nyemete ŋu fɔ fu o.

I am well aware of this.	Menya nu tso esia ŋu nyuie.
However, the rules governing it remain very different.	Gake se siwo ku ɖe eŋu la gakpɔtɔ to vovo kura.

He was a character.	Ame aɖee wònye.
Thank you all very much.	Akpe na mi katã ŋutɔ.

Nevertheless, it is clear that this possibility exists.	Ke hã, eme kɔ ƒã be nu sia si ate ŋu adzɔ la li.
More fire, more angry faces.	Dzo geɖe wu, mo siwo do dziku wu.

I understood that he cared about me.	Mese egɔme be etsɔ ɖe le eme nam.

But you know someone.	Gake ènya ame aɖe.

Everything and a little bit of everything	Nusianu kple nusianu ƒe akpa sue aɖe

Something is wrong.	Nane gblẽ.

Stop whatever you are doing.	Dzudzɔ nusianu si wɔm nèle.

I was the last one down	Nyee nye ame mamlɛtɔ si ɖi
One piece at a time.	Akpa ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
This allows them to be seen by many.	Esia na ame geɖe te ŋu kpɔa wo.
I just couldn’t stand it at home	Ðeko nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu le aƒeme o
And maybe another after that.	Eye ɖewohĩ bubu le ema megbe.
It is something I should expect, too.	Enye nusi wòle be makpɔ mɔ na, ​​hã.
Yet it’s only been two years.	Ke hã ƒe eve koe nye esia.
I'll probably get there.	Anye be mava ɖo afima.
Not all of them, at least.	Menye wo katã ya teti o.
I think it could be something better.	Mesusu be ate ŋu anye nane si nyo wu.
I was able to solve that problem	Mete ŋu kpɔ kuxi ma gbɔ
I can’t talk about this right now	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu tso esia ŋu fifia o
I really don’t know what to say to him	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nya si magblɔ nɛ o
What is that.	Nukae nye ema.
This was going to be bad.	Esia nɔ gbegblẽ ge.
I don’t know this guy personally	Nye ŋutɔ nyemenya ŋutsu sia o
I would have done anything for him.	Anye ne mewɔ nu sia nu nɛ hafi.
I don’t know why anyone would want this job to do this job.	Nyemenya nusita ame aɖe adi be dɔ sia nawɔ dɔ sia o.
That was some time ago.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye sia.
He could not explain or explain.	Mete ŋu ɖe eme alo ɖe egɔme o.

To have someone who looks up to you.	Be ame aɖe si doa ŋku ɖe ŋuwò la nanɔ asiwò.
He seemed surprised that she was here too.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ be eya hã le afisia ene.
I think there are two pairs	Mesusu be eve eve ye li
That makes me happy.	Ema doa dzidzɔ nam.
I couldn’t find any fault at all	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe vodada aɖeke ŋu kura o

You missed every one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe to ŋuwò.

You have it now.	Ele asiwò fifia.
No one has a problem with that.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ame aɖeke ŋu le ema ŋu o.

It is advisable to book well in advance.	Anyo be nàwɔ agbalẽ do ŋgɔ nyuie.
I don’t think he cares	Mesusu be metsɔ ɖeke le eme o
Set aside some money.	Tsɔ ga aɖe da ɖe vovo.
That can definitely do it.	Ema ate ŋu awɔe godoo.
Also, find another job.	Azɔ hã, di dɔ bubu.
I can only imagine what this looks like	Ðeko mate ŋu akpɔ alesi esia le le susu me
I always knew exactly where he was	Menya afi si tututu wònɔ ɣesiaɣi
But there is no time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi meli o.

I will find a new replacement	Makpɔ ame yeye si axɔ ɖe eteƒe
About that very problematic anger.	Le dziku ma si nye kuxi gã aɖe ŋutɔ ŋu.
This is nothing out of the ordinary.	Esia menye nusi to vovo kura o.
I don’t know if it really is.	Nyemenya nenye be ele nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
It’s just a road.	Mɔ aɖe koe wònye.
But I can’t live in the past	Gake nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe le ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me o
On his way to the scene.	Le eƒe mɔ dzi.
I can’t do it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe o.
I can’t allow myself to do this	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ na ɖokuinye be mawɔ esia o
He had plenty of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe nɔ esi.
I needed to talk to him	Ehiã be maƒo nu kplii
I have been looking for a long time	Medi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia
Not by a long shot.	Menye to tu didi aɖe dzi o.
I need some water.	Mehiã tsi aɖe.
For the time being, that was enough.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, ema sɔ gbɔ.
I saw the market there	Mekpɔ asi la le afima
Not that he could.	Menye ɖe wòate ŋui o.
Which is a huge mistake.	Nusi nye vodada gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
That is absolutely true.	Nya ma nye nyateƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I have always protected myself from it	Mekpɔ ɖokuinye ta tso eme ɣesiaɣi

There are two parts to it.	Akpa eve le eŋu.
I’m fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam.

A lot of things.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ.

Water them.	Tsi wo.
Its really hard time.	Eƒe ɣeyiɣi sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I just don’t see what the big deal is	Ðeko nyemekpɔ nusi nye nya gã la o
You can’t, and for good reason.	Màte ŋui o, eye susu nyui aɖe tae.
I didn’t see you there.	Nyemekpɔ wò le afima o.
I felt something for	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nane na
I felt happy, I did a good job	Mese le ɖokuinye me be dzidzɔ, mewɔ dɔ nyuie
He could never run it out.	Mete ŋu ƒu du wu enu gbeɖe o.
I'll tell you where it is	Magblɔ afi si wòle la na wò
People know them.	Amewo nya wo.
And neither would he.	Eye eya hã mawɔe nenema o.
Exalt Dom.	Dom ɖe dzi.
That wouldn’t work.	Ema mawɔ dɔ o.
I think he does have a point there	Mesusu be nya aɖe le esi le afima nyateƒe
Nothing, really.	Naneke meli o, le nyateƒe me.
I was very nervous	Metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ
I am suddenly nowhere	Nyemele afi aɖeke zi ɖeka o
But that can be useful.	Gake ema ate ŋu aɖe vi na mí.
I can relate to that attitude as well	Mate ŋu awɔ ɖeka kple nɔnɔme ma hã
You know what it is.	Ènya nusi wònye.
But you matter in this fight.	Gake wòe le vevie le avu sia me.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
For a few days at least.	Ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo ya teti.
Not in that way anyway.	Menye le mɔ ma nu le mɔ sia mɔ nu o.
I can’t know your heart	Nyemate ŋu anya wò dzi o
The one took days like this.	Ame ɖeka la xɔ ŋkeke geɖe abe esia ene.
I don’t want to do it either	Nye hã nyemedi be mawɔe o
Not much more than that.	Menye nu geɖe wu ema o.
He couldn’t help and he couldn’t understand.	Mete ŋu wɔ naneke o eye mete ŋu se egɔme o.
I don’t know about that.	Nyemenya nu tso ema ŋu o.
I’m the one here with you	Nyee nye ame si le afi sia kpli wò

And something went wrong.	Eye nane gblẽ.
Thinking about something else.	Nu bubu aɖe ŋu bubu.
I have to act myself	Ele be nye ŋutɔ mawɔ nu
Not always, always will always be	Menye ɣesiaɣi, ɣesiaɣi la, manɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi
I really don’t have much of an idea about anything anymore	Le nyateƒe me la, susu boo aɖeke megale asinye le naneke ŋu o
I can see you doing that	Mete ŋu kpɔa wò nèle nu ma wɔm
I'm sure there's something there	Meka ɖe edzi be nane le afima
We live in the past.	Míele agbe le ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me.
I don’t think it matters much	Mesusu be mehiã boo o
I'm pretty sure he can't stand it either	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ be eya hã mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu o
I'll come and get you.	Mava xɔ wò.
These times are right.	Ɣeyiɣi siawo sɔ.
He wasn’t talking to me.	Menye ɖe wònɔ nu ƒom nam o.
There is no debt or debt.	Fe alo fe aɖeke meli o.
They just have to hurry.	Ðeko wòle be woawɔ kaba.
No one stayed very long.	Ame aɖeke menɔ anyi eteƒe didi ŋutɔ o.
I wonder who is ready to do that	Mebia be amekae le klalo be yeawɔ ema hã
There is absolutely no issue.	Nya aɖeke meli kura o.
He can’t stay here.	Mate ŋu anɔ afisia o.
And this is just the opposite.	Eye esia to vovo na ema tututu.
I had been so sure	Meka ɖe edzi ale gbegbe kpɔ
I want to talk to you about that	Medi be maƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu na wò
Many couldn’t stand it.	Ame geɖe mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
I can’t imagine my life without you	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nye agbe le susu me wò manɔmee o
I wondered what had changed.	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae trɔ hã.
But it might not be either.	Gake ɖewohĩ manɔ nenema hã o.
I really want to go with you now	Medi vevie be mayi kpli wò azɔ edzi
And this is a fact.	Eye esia nye nyateƒe.
But he made a mistake.	Gake ewɔ vodada.
I was so worried about it	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe
Look, this is important, you know.	Kpɔ ɖa, esia le vevie, ènya.
That helped a little bit.	Ema kpe ɖe eŋu vie.
I excluded others from my own tribe	Meɖe ame bubu siwo tso nye ŋutɔ nye to me la ɖa
I did feel a little older	Mese le ɖokuinye me be metsi vie ya
I knew they had been talking about me	Menya be wole nu ƒom tso ŋunye kpɔ
That is the law.	Emae nye se la.
There is nothing wrong with it.	Naneke mele eŋu o.
I have to see this guy	Ele nam be makpɔ ŋutsu sia
I just tried.	Ðeko medze agbagba.
I don’t really want to talk to him right now.	Nyemedi ŋutɔŋutɔ be maƒo nu kplii fifia o.
Go back inside.	Trɔ yi eme.
I looked like someone else	Medze abe ame bubu aɖe ene
This worked for him.	Esia wɔ dɔ nɛ.
A few of them got there.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo va ɖo afima.
I couldn’t stand it	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o
Write a book about it.	Ŋlɔ agbalẽ aɖe tso eŋu.
And in that me la.	Le go ma me la.
I know who you really are	Menya ame si tututu nènye
In fact, it is not easy for any of us.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele bɔbɔe na mía dometɔ aɖeke o.
But it was a big mistake.	Gake vodada gã aɖee wònye.
I asked one of them	Mebia nu tso wo dometɔ ɖeka gbɔ
I give you my heart	Metsɔ nye dzi na wò
I set aside a meal for you	Metsɔ nuɖuɖu aɖe da ɖe vovo na wò
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I became very fussy	Meva nɔ fu ɖem vevie ŋutɔ
He's in school.	Ele suku.
It’s more of the same.	Enye nusi sɔ kple esia wu.
I can never feel at home, ever.	Nyemate ŋu ase le ɖokuinye me gbeɖe be mele aƒeme o, gbeɖe o.
That doesn’t matter.	Ema mehiã o.
I didn’t recognize the man before me	Nyemekpɔ ŋutsu si do ŋgɔ nam la dze sii o
I relaxed for the first time in my life	Meɖe dzi ɖi zi gbãtɔ le agbe me
That makes so much sense.	Susu le nya ma me ale gbegbe.
Yet he did not answer.	Ke hã meɖo eŋu o.
He was a good guy.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe.
That’s what it is.	Emae nye ema.
Depending on your own situation.	Le wò ŋutɔ wò nɔnɔme nu.
It didn’t take long.	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
Everyone can live with that	Amesiame ate ŋu anɔ agbe kple ema
And trust me.	Eye ka ɖe dzinye.
Also I’m available in the summer.	Azɔ hã me li le dzomeŋɔli me.
Many of them are illiterate.	Wo dometɔ geɖe menya agbalẽ o.
I might not have surprised you	Ðewohĩ mewɔ nuku na wò hafi
I need that now.	Mehiã ema fifia.
He couldn’t do anything.	Mete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
It’s something like this.	Enye nane si le abe esia ene.
They’re going to talk.	Wole nu ƒo ge.
There are two issues there.	Nya eve le afima.
I have a very good reason to do so	Susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ le asinye be mawɔe nenema
It was a pleasure talking with you.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be meɖo dze kpli wò.
I don’t want to do either	Nyemedi be mawɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o
Put your hand here.	Tsɔ wò asi da ɖe afisia.

I was waiting for this moment	Menɔ ɣeyiɣi sia lalam
I suggest you do the same	Meɖo aɖaŋu na wò be nàwɔ nenema ke
I grew up with nothing	Metsi naneke manɔmee
But I understood it	Gake mese egɔme
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That means a few things.	Ema fia nu ʋɛ aɖewo.
He had been sick.	Edze dɔ kpɔ.
They are really important.	Wole vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But enough of what it is.	Gake nusi wònye la sɔ gbɔ.
He has my respect.	Nye bubu le esi.
There was no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
I didn’t know it would bother you that much	Nyemenya be aɖe fu na wò nenema o
A tiny little thing with a big voice.	Nu sue sue aɖe si ƒe gbe gã aɖe le.

Please, go now.	Meɖe kuku, yi azɔ.
I think he was tired	Mesusu be ɖeɖi te eŋu
I really wish she hadn't said that	Medi vevie be ɖe megblɔ nya ma o
In fact, it’s quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo kura.
A real man would never do that	Ŋutsu ŋutɔŋutɔ mawɔ nu ma gbeɖe o
I can’t do that from here	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema tso afisia o
I know them very well	Menya wo nyuie ŋutɔ
The pool is right behind the building.	Ta la le xɔa megbe tututu.
Which didn’t last long.	Nusi menɔ anyi didi o.
I don’t know what that means	Nyemenya nusi ema fia o
It can kill you.	Ate ŋu awu wò.
That’s what’s still important to me.	Emae nye nusi gakpɔtɔ le vevie nam.
I couldn’t really hear them	Nyemete ŋu se wo ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I didn’t like this at all	Esia medze ŋunye kura o
I have such confidence in my life	Meka ɖe nye agbe dzi alea
I can help you day to day.	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò tso ŋkeke yi ŋkeke.
Take care of your life today.	Lé be na wò agbe egbea.

He can’t help anyone right now.	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe ame aɖeke ŋu fifia o.
Many others did not.	Ame bubu geɖe mewɔe nenema o.
Otherwise, I can’t do him any good	Ne menye nenema o la, nyemate ŋu awɔ nyui aɖeke nɛ o
I ought to have told you all these things myself	Ðe wòle be nye ŋutɔ magblɔ nya siawo katã na mi hafi
Now it will be easier.	Fifia anɔ bɔbɔe.

It’s the heart on the head.	Enye dzi si le ta dzi.
He came himself.	Eya ŋutɔ va.

I’m not asking for that right now.	Nyemele ema biam fifia o.

That’s his job anyway.	Emae nye eƒe dɔ le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I have good news for you though.	Nya nyui aɖe le asinye na mi gake.

He didn’t see anything.	Mekpɔ naneke o.
He would be the closest.	Anye amesi te ɖe ame ŋu wu.

The idea that you can be anything you want.	Susu si nye be àte ŋu anye nusianu si nèdi.
The house and the pool are one	Aƒea kple ta la nye ɖeka
But it’s not just yet.	Gake menye haɖe ko o.
Not in my own home.	Menye nye ŋutɔ nye aƒe me o.
It hit me for the first time.	Edze dzinye zi gbãtɔ.
I really care about you	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò ŋutɔŋutɔ
This is not going to resolve itself.	Esia mele eɖokui gbɔ kpɔm o.
Please contact us if you have any questions.	Taflatse te ɖe mía ŋu ne nya aɖe le asiwò.
I really like that thread.	Ka ma dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
That is the truth.	Emae nye nyateƒea.
One of my ideas also came true	Nye susu aɖe hã va eme
I missed you yesterday	Mesusu wò etsɔ
The building is new.	Xɔa nye yeye.
I just met this guy	Ðeko medo go ŋutsu sia teti koe nye ema
Here through me.	Afi sia to nye dzi.
I believe in what we are doing here	Mexɔ nusi wɔm míele le afisia dzi se
But it could have been.	Gake ate ŋu anɔ nenema hafi.
It can be present.	Ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
You know what it might be like.	Ènya alesi wòate ŋu anɔ.
I remember that very, very clearly.	Meɖo ŋku ema dzi eme kɔ ŋutɔ, eme kɔ ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t keep talking.	Mete ŋu nɔ nu ƒom o.
We are not like you.	Míele abe wò ene o.
Maybe a lot of lives.	Ðewohĩ agbe geɖe.
Twice in two weeks.	Zi eve le kwasiɖa eve me.
I may live more or I may live less	Ðewohĩ manɔ agbe geɖe wu alo anɔ agbe sue aɖe ko
We have to do this together.	Ele be míawɔ esia ɖekae.
He needed a better idea.	Ehiã susu bubu si nyo wu.
I was the last one alive	Nyee nye ame mamlɛtɔ si nɔ agbe
I told him exactly what it was.	Megblɔ nusi tututu wònye nɛ.
This is different from before.	Esia to vovo na tsã.
That was not a good time.	Menye ɣeyiɣi nyuie nye ema o.
Maybe he’ll do his job now.	Ðewohĩ awɔ eƒe dɔa fifia.
I have everything working fine.	Nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie le asinye.
It's just that simple.	Ðeko wòle bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe.
This also seems strange.	Esia hã dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ene.
He was satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme.
But this shouldn’t be surprising.	Gake mele be esia nawɔ nuku o.
He would do anything for her.	Awɔ nusianu nɛ.
They should have no problems.	Mele be kuxi aɖeke nanɔ wo ŋu o.
It was a waste of time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ aɖe.
I know that very well	Menya nya ma nyuie
But maybe it doesn’t matter.	Gake ɖewohĩ mehiã o.
I have to fight this	Ele nam be mawɔ avu kple esia
We can go now.	Míate ŋu ayi fifia.
Or for the sake of honor.	Alo ɖe bubu ta.
I have the gun, remember	Tu la le asinye, ɖo ŋku edzi
Maybe I should talk, have a conversation	Ðewohĩ ele be maƒo nu, aɖo dze
In his life now.	Le eƒe agbe me fifia.
A few days later, the same thing happened	Le ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo megbe la, nu ma ke dzɔ
Go out more often.	Do go zi geɖe wu.
I know what that looks like	Menya alesi ema le
But that’s just the kind of guy he is.	Gake ŋutsu si ƒomevi wònye koe nye ema.
A year is a long time	Ƒe ɖeka nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ
Four of them.	Wo dometɔ ene.
I decided to give up another room.	Meɖoe be maɖe asi le xɔ bubu ŋu.
I was angry with him, and he was angry with me	Medo dziku nɛ, eye eya hã do dziku nam
Really interesting stuff.	Nu siwo doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I understand that this is a bit odd	Mese egɔme be esia nye nusi to vovo vie
But not much help.	Gake menye kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe o.
I wasn’t alone after all	Menye nye ɖeka koe nɔ anyi le nyateƒe me o
Do your job.	Wɔ wò dɔ.
He couldn’t think of it.	Mete ŋu bu eŋu o.
Looks like a nice morning here.	Edze abe ŋdi nyui aɖe le afisia ene.
I made them alone	Nye ɖeka koe wɔ wo
I had some time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe nɔ asinye.
I saw what it was like.	Mekpɔ alesi wònɔ.
However, there are two major problems.	Ke hã, kuxi gã eve aɖewo li.
He didn’t worry about anything	Metsi dzi ɖe naneke ŋu o
I can just walk through it	Ðeko mate ŋu azɔ to eme
I am not one of them	Menye wo dometɔ ɖekae menye o
I think we are like that.	Mesusu be míele nenema.
There are many problems with this.	Kuxi geɖe le esia ŋu.
That works for me.	Ema wɔa dɔ nam.
Change with error.	Trɔ kple vodada.
And the car, too.	Eye ʋua hã.
I know that means they’re here	Menya be ema fia be wole afisia
In that context, it is by not buying.	Le nya ma me la, enye to menye ƒle o me.
There is no money.	Ga aɖeke meli o.
Please contact me if you have any questions.	Taflatse te ɖe ŋunye ne èle nya aɖe biam.
There is a lot of literature on that aspect.	Agbalẽ geɖe le akpa ma ŋu.
I think it worked well	Mesusu be ewɔ dɔ nyuie
And it wasn’t like my hair.	Eye menɔ abe nye ɖa ene o.
This was very exciting for me.	Esia do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
But, for a reason.	Gake, susu aɖe tae.
Your name will never come up.	Wò ŋkɔ mava do gbeɖe o.
There was nothing for him at home.	Naneke menɔ anyi nɛ le aƒeme o.
I haven’t seen one in days	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke le ŋkeke geɖe me o
Everyone else is home by now.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe va ɖo aƒeme fifia.
But this.	Gake esia.
Now I am officially an hour late	Fifia metsi megbe gaƒoƒo ɖeka le se nu
Many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe.
Buy a few pairs.	Ƒle eve ʋɛ aɖewo.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I think you have a good idea	Mesusu be susu nyui aɖe le asiwò
You are fighting for your life.	Èle avu wɔm ɖe wò agbe ta.
I don’t think it could get any better	Nyemesusu be ate ŋu anyo wu ema o
I’ve seen my town change and I’m with it	Mekpɔ nye du la trɔ eye nye hã mele eŋu
I had a good chat with him today.	Meɖo dze nyuie kplii egbea.
He enjoyed this, but he could never do it for himself.	Esia do dzidzɔ nɛ, gake mate ŋu awɔe na eɖokui gbeɖe o.
I have been trying to talk to you for days	Mele agbagba dzem be maƒo nu na mi ŋkeke geɖe
It was an expensive project, and there was a lot of work involved.	Enye dɔ si xɔ asi ŋutɔ, eye dɔ geɖe nɔ eme.
I am fucking angry.	Mele fu ɖem le dziku me.
I hope you are anyway	Mele mɔ kpɔm be èle nenema le mɔ sia mɔ nu
That’s an impossibly good idea.	Ema nye susu nyui aɖe si mate ŋu adzɔ o.
The same logic applies here.	Susu ma ke sɔ le afisia hã.
I should have done it	Ele be mawɔe hafi
I was new to all of them	Nyee nye ame yeye na wo katã
I had just taken the lead	Ðeko meva xɔ ŋgɔ teti koe nye ema
One said, this works well.	Ame ɖeka gblɔ be, esia wɔa dɔ nyuie.
I have told you the truth	Megblɔ nyateƒea na mi
I can’t feel anything	Nyemate ŋu ase naneke le ɖokuinye me o
But no one is talking about this.	Gake ame aɖeke mele nu ƒom tso nya sia ŋu o.
I needed to stay alive	Ehiã be manɔ agbe
I can’t say the same about myself	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma ke tso ɖokuinye ŋu o
I want all the varieties available	Medi ƒomevi siwo katã li
It’s absolutely amazing.	Ewɔ nuku kura.
I think every man has his hand	Mesusu be ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe ƒe asi le esi
I can’t really understand it	Nyemate ŋu ase egɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ o
There will be an opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe anɔ anyi.
I could only manage that once	Zi ɖeka koe mete ŋu kpɔ ema dzi
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He can’t talk to her.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu kplii o.
I couldn’t understand it	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme o
Think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ.
I am the only one.	Nye ɖeka koe li.
I have something to do earlier though	Nane le asinye mawɔ do ŋgɔ gake
This is not an easy task	Esia menye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖeke o
I knew he would do that	Menya be awɔe nenema
It’s a problem of time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi ƒe kuxi aɖe.
I think he has you	Mesusu be wò le esi
I've been here a while.	Meva afisia ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
I hoped it wouldn’t bother him.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be maɖe fu nɛ o.
He really enjoyed it.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ nyateƒe.
I was too hot.	Mexɔ dzo akpa.
I couldn’t do it though.	Nyemete ŋu wɔe o gake.
You can, of course, call.	Àte ŋu aƒo ka ya.
I need your help in my anger	Mehiã wò kpekpeɖeŋu le nye dziku me
I just couldn’t let that happen	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ɖe mɔ nenema o
This went much better.	Esia yi ŋgɔ nyuie wu.
King gets his gun.	Fia xɔa eƒe tu.
That’s all there is to it.	Esia koe nye ema.
Today more people have died.	Egbea ame geɖe wu ku.
Himself or myself.	Eya ŋutɔ alo nye ŋutɔ.
Something was going on.	Nane nɔ edzi yim.
But I am enjoying it.	Gake mele dzidzɔ kpɔm nɛ.
I finally realized why they were all so unhappy	Meva kpɔ nusita wo katã ƒe dzi medze eme o la dze sii mlɔeba
That’s part of it.	Ema nye eƒe akpa aɖe.
It was wonderful to have everyone together and in my home.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ be amesiame nɔ anyi ɖekae eye wònɔ nye aƒeme.
I don’t want to do that	Nyemedi be mawɔ nu ma o
I was wrong to get you in here	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ esi mexɔ wò ɖe afisia me
I kind of gave up after that	Meɖe asi le eŋu le ema megbe le mɔ aɖe nu
I think people will be very popular.	Mesusu be amewo axɔ ŋkɔ ŋutɔ.
I can’t understand what you’re going through	Nyemate ŋu ase nusi me tom nèle la gɔme o
I can do it easily	Mate ŋu awɔe bɔbɔe
He didn’t ask for some reason.	Mebia le susu aɖewo ta o.
A little breeze blew	Ya sue aɖe tu
This section is not working.	Akpa sia mele dɔ wɔm o.
I can already tell what this is about.	Mate ŋu anya nusi ŋu esia ku ɖo xoxo.
Going out is never easy.	Do go mele bɔbɔe gbeɖe o.
Or any kind of guy, really.	Alo ŋutsu ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe, le nyateƒe me.
I was like being in two places at once	Menɔ abe ɖe mele teƒe eve zi ɖeka ene
I was one of them was my idea of ​​myself	Menye wo dometɔ ɖeka nye nye susu le ɖokuinye ŋu
I hope that doesn’t surprise you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ema mawɔ nuku na wò o.
Not at any price.	Menye le asi aɖeke nu o.
I think this will work	Mesusu be esia awɔ dɔ
I felt nauseous several times	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye lãme ƒo zi geɖe
I am right in one.	Mele eteƒe le ɖeka me.
I didn’t feel anything	Nyemese naneke le ɖokuinye me o
Please tell me what you think.	Taflatse gblɔ nusi nèsusu nam.
There are many things we can guard against in this book.	Nu geɖe li siwo ŋu míate ŋu adzɔ ɖo le agbalẽ sia me.
That doesn’t seem to be the case here.	Edze abe mele alea le afisia o ene.
But this case is different.	Gake nya sia to vovo.
I should never have met him	Mele be mado go gbeɖe o hafi
I am a part of it.	Nye nye akpa aɖe.
Go on your way.	Yi wò mɔ dzi.
But it will end.	Gake awu enu.
Something told me he needed something or wanted something from us.	Nane gblɔ nam be ehiã nane alo di nane tso mía gbɔ.
I have to keep running	Ele be mayi edzi anɔ du dzi
People can know that guns are real.	Amewo ate ŋu anya be tu nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That is very important to us.	Ema le vevie na mí ŋutɔ.
So was his, too.	Nenema ke eya tɔ hã nɔ.
It’s not just ambition.	Menye didi vevie koe wònye o.
I think this would be great	Mesusu be esia anyo ŋutɔ
I was determined to endure everything	Meɖoe be mado dzi le nusianu me
People are running in every direction.	Amewo le du dzi le mɔ ɖesiaɖe dzi.
I guess in your case he doesn’t have to try	Mesusu be le wò nya me la, mehiã be wòate kpɔ o
I have it right here	Ele asinye le afisia tututu
This will end tonight.	Esia awu enu le zã sia me.
I did that, too.	Mewɔe nenema hã.
I needed to do what needed to be done	Ehiã be mawɔ nusi hiã be mawɔ
That's too long.	Ema didi akpa.
Consider everything before you act, too.	Bu nusianu ŋu hafi nàwɔ nane, hã.
I think it surprised all of us	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku na mí katã
I could never tell anyone about it	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ eŋu nya na ame aɖeke gbeɖe o
I wondered a bit though	Mebia nya ɖokuinye vie gake
I wanted to meet him.	Medi be mado go kplii.
Doing anything else.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe wɔwɔ.
Be a creative person.	Nye ame si wɔa nu.
Deal with them as they are planned.	Kpɔ wo gbɔ abe alesi wole ɖoɖo wɔm ene.
There is something wrong.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖe li.
I don’t want to talk about that yet.	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso ema ŋu haɖe o.
Now we are talking.	Fifia míele nu ƒom.
I don’t like this room	Xɔ sia medze ŋunye o
I knew what lay ahead.	Menya nusi le ŋgɔ nam.
I took a few things out of it all though	Meɖe nu ʋɛ aɖewo le wo katã me gake
It was just one word, one little word.	Nya ɖeka koe wònye, nya sue ɖeka ko.
I’ve only done that once.	Zi ɖeka koe mewɔ nu ma kpɔ.
There is no name.	Ŋkɔ aɖeke meli o.
And there are many of them.	Eye wo dometɔ geɖe li.
I had no idea you were here	Nyemenya kura be èle afisia o
I don’t want to come home without one	Nyemedi be mava aƒeme ɖeka manɔmee o
None of them took his eyes off her.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meɖe eƒe ŋku ɖa o.
I have enough sweat.	Fifia sɔ gbɔ le ŋunye.
You like where you are.	Afisi nèle la dzɔa dzi na wò.
He couldn’t believe me.	Mete ŋu xɔ dzinye se o.
I couldn’t look away either	Nye hã nyemete ŋu ɖe ŋku ɖa o
That’s why he couldn’t disappear.	Esia tae mete ŋu bu o ɖo.
I just thought you would like this place	Ðeko mesusu be teƒe sia adzɔ dzi na wò
But it hasn’t arrived yet.	Gake meva ɖo haɖe o.
Maybe he will eventually help them.	Ðewohĩ ava kpe ɖe wo ŋu mlɔeba.
But it seems impossible.	Gake edze abe manya wɔ o ene.
I haven’t been this happy in a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ alea gbegbe o.
I got into a lot of trouble because of that	Meva ge ɖe kuxi geɖe me le ema ta
I would love to talk to them!	Adzɔ dzi nam be maƒo nu na wo!
I didn’t see anyone or anything	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke alo naneke o
I know this in the back of my mind somewhere	Menya esia le nye susu ƒe megbe le afi aɖe
There will be no issues.	Nya aɖeke mava o.
The other, not so much.	Bubu la, menye nenema gbegbe o.
That’s all something.	Ema katã nye nane.
I was just hoping for more to come	Ðeko menɔ mɔ kpɔm be nu geɖe wu mava
I became convinced that they were all talking about me	Meva ka ɖe edzi be wo katã wole nu ƒom tso ŋunye
We’re all fine.	Mí katã míele nyuie.
It doesn’t do the job.	Mewɔa dɔa o.
Not sure if it will help you though.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be akpe ɖe ŋuwò o gake.
I just did it all at once	Ðeko mewɔe katã zi ɖeka
They are starting to.	Wole egɔme dzem be.
I know the right word	Menya nya si sɔ
But a few people did.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo ya wɔe nenema.
I knew he didn’t understand	Menya be mese egɔme o
I was wondering if this was the case	Menɔ ɖokuinye biam be ɖe esia le nenema hã
That’s exciting.	Ema doa dzidzɔ na ame.
Very few actually showed up.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe va ŋutɔŋutɔ.

Here are just a few of them.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe nye esi.
But it wasn’t me.	Gake menye nyee o.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
That’s more of the same.	Ema nye nu ɖeka ma ke geɖe wu.
I can’t get out of here without you	Nyemate ŋu ado go le afisia wò manɔmee o
It worked out well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
Everything was up and up.	Nusianu nɔ dzi yim kple dzi.
I think it’s a problem.	Mesusu be enye kuxi.
I still have that problem	Kuxi ma gakpɔtɔ le ŋunye
If he is not too tired.	Ne ɖeɖi mete eŋu akpa o la.
I was ready to go anyway	Menɔ klalo be mayi to mɔ sia mɔ nu
I couldn’t stand it, really	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o, le nyateƒe me
I had a great time myself	Nye ŋutɔ mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe ŋutɔ
But someone did that.	Gake ame aɖe wɔe nenema.
One of the most impressive songs	Ha siwo wɔa dɔ ɖe ame dzi wu la dometɔ ɖeka
He will never beat people down.	Maƒo amewo ɖe anyi gbeɖe o.
I heard that he really cared about me	Mese be etsɔ ɖe le eme nam ŋutɔŋutɔ
I knew exactly what was coming	Menya nusi tututu gbɔna
I couldn’t get through it	Nyemete ŋu to eme o
There was no reason for something.	Susu aɖeke menɔ nane ŋu o.
The matter is as follows.	Nya la le ale.
I had to do this in a completely different order.	Ele be mawɔ esia le ɖoɖo si to vovo kura me.
No one cares what happened to me.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le nu si dzɔ ɖe dzinye me o.
I needed it, of course.	Mehiã ya.
Have your life in your hands.	Wò agbe nanɔ asiwò.
And it’s very important.	Eye ele vevie ŋutɔ.
I have to work.	Ele be mawɔ dɔ.
There are a few reasons why.	Susu ʋɛ aɖewo li siwo tae.
Through appropriate procedures.	To ɖoɖo siwo sɔ me.

That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I really enjoyed everything	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ le nusianu me
I know this is hard for you too	Menya be esia sesẽ na wò hã
I needed to tell the truth	Ehiã be magblɔ nyateƒea
I did the job.	Mewɔ dɔa.
I was a little surprised, that’s all	Mewɔ nuku vie, ema koe nye ema
And now we know there is a better way.	Eye fifia míenya be mɔ aɖe li si nyo wu.
I think there’s a good reason	Mesusu be susu nyui aɖe li
I have faith in everyone here.	Mexɔ amesiame dzi se le afisia.
He may never know.	Ðewohĩ manya gbeɖe o.
He could barely talk about anything else at all.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu tso nu bubu aɖeke ŋu kura kura o.
I can give you anything you want	Mate ŋu ana nu sia nu si nèdi la wò
Now, things are different.	Fifia, nuwo to vovo.
I got you some help.	Mexɔ kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo na wò.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
Now, not so much.	Fifia, menye nenema gbegbe o.
Some people annoy us.	Ame aɖewo doa dziku na mí.

I was able to bring a lot of myself into my work.	Mete ŋu tsɔ ɖokuinye geɖe va nye dɔa me.
A desire is different	Didi aɖe to vovo
I look forward to meeting you as well	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be mado go wò hã
But this is so difficult.	Gake esia sesẽ ale gbegbe.
There is nothing new about that.	Nu yeye aɖeke mele ema ŋu o.
A little original.	Gbãtɔ vie.
I would have done that.	Anye ne mewɔe nenema hafi.
I just want to be close to you	Ðeko medi be mate ɖe ŋuwò
I didn’t know anything after that	Nyemenya naneke le ema megbe o
You’re not okay, you’re out of your mind.	Mèle nyuie o, mèle susu me na wò o.
I doubt it will benefit him	Meke ɖi be aɖe vi nɛ
I didn’t recognize any of them	Nyemekpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke dze sii o
He couldn’t find anything.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe naneke ŋu o.
He will not come out for us.	Mado go ɖe mía ta o.
That’s good in a way.	Ema nyo le mɔ aɖe nu.
Want more, buy two!!.	Di be yeakpɔ nu geɖe wu, ƒle eve!!.
I wondered if he was ready for something like this	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe wòle klalo na nane si le abe esia ene hã
I knew what was going through his head	Menya nusi nɔ eƒe ta me tom
Everything was like that.	Nusianu nɔ nenema.
I don’t know what it is	Nyemenya nusi wònye o
My hard work.	Nye dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ.
I don’t want to be here at all	Nyemedi be manɔ afisia kura o
I did follow this, of course	Mewɔ ɖe esia dzi ya
I had to tell him the truth	Ele nam be magblɔ nyateƒea nɛ
I can give you a copy	Mate ŋu ana eƒe ɖe
Everything is in order.	Nusianu le eme nyuie.
I can also know what you are looking for	Mate ŋu anya nu si dim nèle hã
This is a huge market.	Esia nye asi gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
It didn’t really impress me	Mewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I should never have met you	Ðe mele be mado go wò gbeɖe o hafi
I was just having fun behind it	Ðeko menɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm le megbe nɛ
I know things could be better	Menya be nuwo ate ŋu anyo wu esia
He’s a pretty great guy.	Eye wònye ame gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But it did have a positive side.	Gake eƒe akpa nyui aɖe nɔ eŋu ya.
I have nothing bad to say about them.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖeke mele asinye le wo ŋu o.
I never touched a gun	Nyemeka asi tu ŋu kpɔ o
I don’t understand what happened.	Nyemese nu si dzɔ la gɔme o.
I had more than one room	Xɔ siwo wu ɖeka nɔ asinye
But it’s a place for me to stay.	Gake enye teƒe si manɔ.

It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He is always there	Ele afima ɣesiaɣi
Talk about everything else.	Ƒo nu tso nu bubu ɖesiaɖe ŋu.
But he cannot be king now.	Gake mate ŋu anye fia fifia o.
I never knew what he would do	Nyemenya nusi wòawɔ gbeɖe o
That’s the last word.	Emae nye nya mamlɛtɔ.
And in that moment, something happened to him.	Eye le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, nane dzɔ ɖe edzi.
I don’t believe that.	Nyemeka ɖe nya ma dzi o.
I can’t control that	Nyemate ŋu aɖu ema dzi o

No one had ever been so interested in me.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖe le eme nam nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.

I didn’t feel that way	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema o
That surprised me a lot.	Ema wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
But that’s not my concern.	Gake menye emae nye nusi ŋu metsi dzi ɖo o.
I had felt this time	Mese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ zi sia
I was planning to go.	Menɔ ɖoɖo wɔm be mayi.
I am so happy to be alive.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mele agbe.
It’s a real challenge.	Enye kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You have too much free time in your life.	Vovo le ŋuwò akpa le wò agbe me.
I see you, maybe too clearly	Mekpɔ wò, ɖewohĩ eme kɔ akpa
There may be some truth to that.	Nyateƒe aɖe ate ŋu anɔ nya ma me.
I got out of it at once.	Medo le eme zi ɖeka.
We know each other well.	Míenya mía nɔewo nyuie.
I think it’s a bad thing.	Mesusu be enye nu gbegblẽ.
I want you so badly	Medi wò vevie ŋutɔ
Again, only this morning on breakfast.	Le afisia hã la, ŋdi sia koe le ŋdi nuɖuɖu me.
I would definitely do it differently	Mawɔe le mɔ bubu nu godoo
I look forward to that, I look forward to that	Mele mɔ kpɔm na ema, mele mɔ kpɔm na ema
I didn’t feel like we were really part of it.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be míenye eƒe akpa aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I don’t know what to do	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o
And they don’t have to do anything.	Eye mehiã be woawɔ naneke o.
To someone from here.	Na ame aɖe si tso afisia.
I am doing well now.	Mele edzi dzem nyuie fifia.
To some extent, there is a lot.	Va ɖo afi aɖe la, nu geɖe li.
That, in itself, is amazing.	Ema, le eɖokui si, wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I tried a thousand ways without success.	Mete mɔ akpe ɖeka kpɔ gake medze edzi o.
I would love to have one like this	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be ɖeka si le abe esia ene nanɔ asinye
It is very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ.
I didn’t hear or see anyone	Nyemese ame aɖeke alo kpɔ ame aɖeke o
But answer this question.	Gake ɖo nya sia ŋu.
It was just too weird.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku akpa.
Not that I was that impressed	Menye ɖe mewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye nenema gbegbe o
I just want to join him in this.	Ðeko wòle be madi be mawɔ ɖeka kplii le esia me.
And he didn’t want to do that.	Eye medi be yeawɔ nu ma o.
I promise you everything will be the same	Medo ŋugbe na mi be nusianu anɔ abe tsã ene
I was planning on quitting soon anyway	Menɔ ɖoɖo wɔm be maɖe asi le eŋu kpuie le mɔ sia mɔ nu
Everything seemed normal.	Edze abe nusianu sɔ ene.
I think everybody knows	Mesusu be amesiame nya
So much happened that year.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ dzɔ le ƒe ma me.
I just can’t understand it	Ðeko nyemate ŋu ase egɔme o
I started school and didn’t know anyone	Medze suku gɔme eye nyemenya ame aɖeke o
Put us on it.	Do mí ɖe edzi.
If you can explain.	Ne àte ŋu aɖe eme.
I would like to come too	Nye hã madi be mava
This is a difficult task.	Esia nye dɔ sesẽ.
This year has been great so far.	Ƒe sia nye nu gã aɖe vaseɖe fifia.
I just knew there was something to this	Ðeko menya be nane le esia ŋu
Or very angry.	Alo dziku ŋutɔ.
There was trouble here.	Kuxi nɔ afisia.
It wouldn’t have come naturally.	Anye ne mava le eɖokui si o.
That's better.	Ema nyo wu.
This is appropriate.	Esia sɔ.
There didn’t seem to be any.	Edze abe ɖeke menɔ anyi o ene.
Last week, this didn’t seem to work.	Kwasiɖa si va yi me la, edze abe esia mewɔ dɔ o ene.
It was a job.	Dɔ aɖee wònye.
Believe me, it’s true.	Xɔ dzinye se, enye nyateƒe.
That's me.	Nyee nye ema.
I didn’t want to talk to him	Nyemedi be maƒo nu kplii o
I handled that too	Mekpɔ ema hã gbɔ
A real job	Dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe
And there was blood.	Eye ʋu hã nɔ anyi.
I had only seen the face.	Mo la koe mekpɔ kpɔ.
It’s not necessarily as simple as that.	Menye nusi le bɔbɔe abe ema ene kokoko o.
But once is enough.	Gake zi ɖeka sɔ gbɔ.
This says.	Esia gblɔ.
I know your good name	Menya wò ŋkɔ nyui
I don’t think he’ll understand.	Nyemesusu be ase egɔme o.
Not in a bad way.	Menye le mɔ gbegblẽ nu o.
I did what was necessary	Mewɔ nusi hiã
I could have gone there	Anye ne mate ŋu ayi afima hafi
Just a little bit .	Vi aɖe ko .
I really like this book.	Agbalẽ sia dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I liked him for that.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam le ema ta.
Some of them are not.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo mele nenema o.
But there is another possibility.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã li si ate ŋu adzɔ.
But I couldn’t thank him	Gake nyemete ŋu da akpe nɛ o
He doesn’t want to make you.	Medi be yeawɔ wò o.
He never wanted this.	Medi esia kpɔ o.
I am very pleased with the result	Nusi do tso eme la dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
I didn’t know he had any	Nyemenya be ɖeke le esi o
A strong man, good for cheap work	Ŋutsu sesẽ aɖe, si nyo na dɔ si mexɔ asi o
I should have explained it to you	Ðe wòle be maɖe eme na mi hafi
I have two wonderful children who are important to me.	Vi nyui eve le asinye siwo le vevie nam.
They’re really hard to make.	Wo wɔwɔ sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
His voice came out loud.	Eƒe gbe do go sesĩe.
I can’t remember who won	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku amesi ɖu dzi dzi o
Maybe that would be just as well.	Ðewohĩ ema hã anyo nenema ke.
I should be happy now.	Ele be makpɔ dzidzɔ fifia.
I hope he wins.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be aɖu dzi.
Someone else can comment on that.	Ame bubu aɖe ate ŋu aƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu.
I have to go to work.	Ele nam be mayi dɔme.
Maybe that’s why.	Ðewohĩ ema tae.
But that is nothing new.	Gake ema menye nu yeye o.
Not so well either.	Menye nyuie nenema gbegbe hã o.
I lent you one	Medo ɖeka na wò
I have seen them together.	Mekpɔ wo ɖekae kpɔ.
I’m glad to have my own car back	Edzɔ dzi nam be nye ŋutɔ nye ʋu trɔ gbɔ
I didn’t know what to do either	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ hã o
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
I do know your work.	Menya wò dɔa ya.
I could never be like you	Nyemate ŋu anɔ abe wò ene gbeɖe o
I’m not sure how we’re going to do this.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi míawɔ esia dzi o.
But just in his hands.	Gake le esi ko.
In the same room.	Xɔ ɖeka me.
I can’t have this going on in my house	Nyemate ŋu ana esia nanɔ edzi yim le nye aƒeme o
You will have no problem now.	Kuxi aɖeke manɔ ŋuwò fifia o.
Or maybe he didn’t remember it as well.	Alo ɖewohĩ meɖo ŋku edzi nenema ke o.
It was a depressing experience.	Enye nusi me nu te ɖe ame dzi le.
I am not that person	Menye nyee nye ame ma o
I couldn't do anything	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nu ɖe ​​naneke ŋu o
I have another way	Mɔ bubu le asinye
Set aside his own life.	Ðe eya ŋutɔ ƒe agbe ɖe vovo.
I haven’t seen one very often at all	Nyemekpɔ ɖeka zi geɖe kura o
That would have been great.	Ema anyo ŋutɔ hafi.
That is very important.	Ema le vevie ŋutɔ.
He can’t be himself.	Mate ŋu anye eya ŋutɔ o.
He put his hand on his head.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ɖo ta dzi.
I don’t trust anyone.	Nyemeka ɖe ame aɖeke dzi o.
I had to make a mistake	Ele be mawɔ vodada
There used to be a name.	Ŋkɔ aɖe nɔ anyi tsã.
I didn’t see anything wrong	Nyemekpɔ naneke si gblẽ o
Mouth was the only thing in it.	Nu koe nye nusi nɔ eme.
So angry, almost all the time.	Dziku ale gbegbe, ɣesiaɣi kloe.
No one would do that.	Ame aɖeke mawɔe nenema o.
There is definitely a strong man here.	Ŋutsu sesẽ aɖe le afisia godoo.
People have overcome it.	Amewo ɖu edzi.
I really wanted to go with them	Medi vevie be mayi kpli wo
He was an incredible teacher.	Enye nufiala si mexɔ se o.
None of us can be angry, really.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu ado dziku o, le nyateƒe me.
I wasn’t sure what to do or say	Nyemeka ɖe nya si mawɔ alo agblɔ dzi o
It is running reasonably fast now.	Ele du dzi le mɔ si sɔ nu fifia.
I know what I want now.	Menya nusi madi fifia.
Change with error.	Trɔ kple vodada.
Imagine what that would be like.	Bu ale si nya ma anya anɔ la ŋu kpɔ.
There seems to be a more complex mechanism.	Edze abe mɔ̃ aɖe si sesẽ wu le eme ene.
I have never heard of anyone having that problem.	Nyemese be kuxi ma le ame aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o.
This help is not available.	Kpekpeɖeŋu sia meli o.
I was angry about everything	Medo dziku ɖe nusianu ŋu
I like what I have.	Nusi le asinye la dze ŋunye.
These days there is help for that too.	Le ŋkeke siawo me la, kpekpeɖeŋu li na ema hã.
I was in that kind of situation years ago	Menɔ nɔnɔme ma ƒomevi me ƒe geɖe va yi
You can speak better.	Àte ŋu aƒo nu nyuie wu.
I know no one else knows about this	Menya be ame bubu aɖeke menya nu tso esia ŋu o
Be that way.	Nye nenema.
Still, keep going.	Ke hã, yi edzi.
We have to do something with you.	Ele be míawɔ nane kpli wò.
Anyone can help me.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
Such a great song.	Ha gã aɖe alea gbegbe.
People talk about it.	Amewo ƒoa nu tso eŋu.
After that, it’s pretty simple.	Le ema megbe la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I sent them all home	Meɖo wo katã ɖe aƒeme
I never heard the full name.	Nyemese ŋkɔ bliboa kpɔ o.
He had no children	Vi aɖeke menɔ esi o
I can talk to my dog ​​normally.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu na nye avu le mɔ si sɔ nu.
I really don’t know.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya o.
I just couldn’t face people	Ðeko nyemete ŋu dze ŋgɔ amewo o
I think you are who you are	Mesusu be wòe nye amesi nènye
Have everyone there.	Na amesiame nanɔ afima.
I'm sure it will work well for some though.	Meka ɖe edzi be awɔ dɔ nyuie na ame aɖewo ke hã.
That was very encouraging.	Ema de dzi ƒo ŋutɔ.
And you can’t have it.	Eye mate ŋu anɔ asiwò o.
I need someone to take over here	Mehiã ame aɖe si axɔ dɔa le afisia
I can’t go on like this	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi alea o
Summer was definitely on its way.	Dzomeŋɔli nɔ mɔ dzi godoo.
I thought you were going to die	Mesusu be èle kuku ge
Please do it quickly.	Taflatse wɔe kaba.
He couldn't try on anyone else.	Mete ŋu dze agbagba ɖe ame bubu ŋu o.
I'll just sit here and talk to you	Ðeko manɔ anyi ɖe afisia aƒo nu kpli wò
This seems reasonable to me.	Esia dze nam be susu le eme.
And this requires money.	Eye esia bia ga.
I have to do it this way	Ele be mawɔe alea
One good word deserves another.	Nya nyui ɖeka dze na bubu.
I know it will come soon	Menya be ava kpuie
I hope you enjoy this place	Mele mɔ kpɔm be teƒe sia adzɔ dzi na wò
At the same time, something good was happening.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me la, nu nyui aɖe nɔ edzi yim.
I wasn’t the only one who was surprised by this	Menye nye ɖeka koe esia wɔ nuku o
But my mind is in order.	Gake nye susu le ɖoɖo nu.
That took me a while.	Ema xɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe nam.
How can I achieve that.	Aleke mawɔ aɖo ema gbɔ.
Otherwise, these two bones are quite different from each other.	Ne menye nenema o la, ƒu eve siawo to vovo kura tso wo nɔewo gbɔ.
I didn’t mind staying in the house	Meɖe fu nam be manɔ aƒea me o
But it is true.	Gake enye nyateƒe.
And maybe it still could be.	Eye ɖewohĩ ate ŋu anɔ nenema kokoko.
You can act in your great !.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu le wò gã !.
It’s a part of me.	Enye nye akpa aɖe.
I couldn’t bring myself to put them on	Nyemete ŋu tsɔ ɖokuinye va do wo o
That didn’t bother me at all	Ema meɖe fu nam kura o
Anyone can do them.	Amesiame ate ŋu awɔ wo.
I didn’t understand anything	Nyemese naneke gɔme o
I saw the whole thing.	Mekpɔ nu bliboa.
But that is a very good point.	Gake nya ma nyo ŋutɔ.
I think he did something to his car	Mesusu be ewɔ nane ɖe eƒe ʋua ŋu
I know that situation now.	Menya nɔnɔme ma fifia.
I can do things for you	Mate ŋu awɔ nuwo na wò
He seemed to like it too.	Edze abe edzɔ dzi nɛ hã ene.
We’re going to play some old songs and some new ones.	Míele ha xoxo aɖewo kple yeye aɖewo ƒo ge.
We can’t find it.	Míate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu o.
I liked him for that.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam le esia ta.
I think it’s very important and very important.	Mesusu be ele vevie ŋutɔ eye wòle vevie ŋutɔ.
He has a long life ahead of him.	Agbe didi aɖe le ŋgɔ nɛ.
His face was broken.	Eƒe mo gblẽ.
I enjoyed many things	Nu geɖe do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
I do this.	Mewɔa esia.
I don’t know how to cope	Nyemenya ale si mawɔ anɔ te ɖe enu o
But I’m so glad I have something to do.	Gake edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be nane le asinye mawɔ.
But, he won’t do that.	Gake, mawɔe nenema o.
But who else .	Gake amekae bubu .
In fact, that is not true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nya ma menye nyateƒe o.
I could very well just kill you	Mate ŋu awu wò ko nyuie ŋutɔ
I was in it for a long time.	Menɔ eme ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
I'll go out on it tomorrow.	Mado go ɖe edzi etsɔ.
He never let go of it.	Meɖe asi le eŋu kpɔ o.
Have an idea about a potential project.	Susu aɖe nanɔ asiwò ku ɖe dɔ aɖe si ate ŋu adzɔ ŋu.
I think you will enjoy it	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò
He is a man of his word.	Enye ame si le eƒe nya nu.
I told you that once before	Megblɔ nya ma na mi zi ɖeka do ŋgɔ
He really did great.	Ewɔ nu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s not just one man.	Menye ŋutsu ɖeka koe o.
It was a surprise to us.	Ewɔ nuku na mí.
But only what is.	Gake nusi li koe.
He couldn’t bear it.	Mete ŋu do dzi o.
There was nothing really to do.	Naneke menɔ anyi woawɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He couldn’t help himself.	Mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe eɖokui nu o.
There was little time left.	Ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe nɔ anyi.
But, it is more real than it was a month ago.	Gake, enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ wu alesi wònɔ ɣleti ɖeka enye sia.
They all last a long time.	Wo katã nɔa anyi didi.
I wondered what was going on	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae nɔ edzi yim hã
Everyone.	Ame sia ame.
Please, let it go.	Taflatse, ɖe asi le eŋu.
But no one will know about it.	Gake ame aɖeke manya nu tso eŋu o.
None of them did that.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
I was dying here	Menɔ ku ge le afisia
I looked at them with respect	Metsɔ bubu nɔ wo kpɔm
But it doesn’t seem to work.	Gake edze abe mewɔa dɔ o ene.
A week ago, he had no idea where he was	Kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia la, menya afisi wòle o
Every word in that book depends on it	Nya ɖesiaɖe si le agbalẽ ma me la nɔ te ɖe edzi
This will appeal to you.	Esia adzɔ dzi na wò.
I had to tell them everything	Ele nam be magblɔ nya sia nya na wo
No one could see me.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu kpɔm o.
I remember it very well	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie ŋutɔ
But it’s not quite there.	Gake mele afima tututu o.
I am here to work for you	Meva afisia be mawɔ dɔ na mi
Felt like it, anyway.	Se le ɖokuinye me be ele nenema, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Here is one way.	Mɔ ɖeka aɖee nye esi.
But that is not quite possible.	Gake ema mate ŋu adzɔ tututu o.
I didn’t want to fight him	Nyemedi be mawɔ avu kplii o
This is quite different.	Esia to vovo kura.
I could have done that	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔe nenema hafi
I had to find a teacher to help me	Ele nam be madi nufiala aɖe si akpe ɖe ŋunye
I really didn’t expect that	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemekpɔ mɔ nenema o
I didn’t really know what to do	Nyemenya nusi tututu mawɔ o
I think part of that will be my fault	Mesusu be ema ƒe akpa aɖe anye nye vodada
It is a grass fire.	Enye gbe ƒe dzo.
There is always a reason.	Susu aɖe nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi.
They are doing very well at home.	Wole edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔ le aƒeme.
That is the ultimate truth.	Emae nye nyateƒe mamlɛtɔ.
It never works that way.	Mewɔa dɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
I just don’t want to say anything	Ðeko nyemedi be magblɔ nya aɖeke o
Time is nothing.	Ɣeyiɣi menye naneke o.
I felt his tongue enter my mouth	Mese le ɖokuinye me be eƒe aɖe ge ɖe nye nu me
I’ve only done it for a week	Kwasiɖa ɖeka koe nye esia mewɔe
And he will continue to do so.	Eye ayi edzi anɔ esia wɔm.
I’m so glad to see you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mekpɔ wò.
I was there last night.	Menɔ afima le zã si va yi me.
It started this week.	Edze egɔme le kwasiɖa sia me.
We can do that.	Míate ŋu awɔ ema.
You know what that means.	Ènya nusi ema fia.
The exact opposite will happen.	Nusi to vovo kura na emae ava.
Why would they do that? 	Nukatae woawɔ nu ma?
He couldn’t stop it.	Mete ŋu tɔ te o.
I need to know exactly where it is	Ele be manya afi si tututu wòle
I told him what had happened to me	Megblɔ nusi dzɔ ɖe dzinye la nɛ
I can’t seem to figure out how.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi mawɔe o ene.
Any other way is always a challenge.	Mɔ bubu ɖesiaɖe nye kuxi ɣesiaɣi.
He eventually lost his heart.	Eƒe dzi va gblẽ le eŋu mlɔeba.
Like what I would do in my room.	Abe nusi mawɔ le nye xɔ me ene.
I felt like telling him that for some reason	Mese le ɖokuinye me be magblɔ nya ma nɛ le susu aɖewo ta
And not a voice on any of them.	Eye menye gbe aɖeke le wo dometɔ aɖeke dzi o.
He gave the child his hand.	Etsɔ eƒe asi na ɖevi la.
I can’t see anyone	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ame aɖeke o
It was only the first week.	Kwasiɖa gbãtɔ koe wònye.
It seems to be going well.	Edze abe ele edzi yim nyuie ene.
These things don’t fit together	Nu siawo mewɔa ɖeka o
And something else.	Eye nu bubu aɖe hã.
I know this wasn’t easy for you	Menya be esia menɔ bɔbɔe na wò o
I want to meet them as soon as possible	Medi be mado go wo kaba ale si mate ŋui
I don’t want to work for someone else.	Nyemedi be mawɔ dɔ na ame bubu o.
I had no idea there was so much in it	Nyemenya kura be nu geɖe le eme nenema gbegbe o
You may already know about a few of them.	Ðewohĩ ènya nu tso wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋu xoxo.
I could do this all day with you	Mate ŋu awɔ esia ŋkeke bliboa kpli wò
Police opened fire, killing two of them.	Kpovitɔwo da tu wo eye wo dometɔ eve ku.
I was four years old	Mexɔ ƒe ene
I have to say something	Ele be magblɔ nya aɖe
Come back again.	Trɔ va ake.
I could have lived in one of them	Anye ne mate ŋu anɔ wo dometɔ aɖe me hafi
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
If not, move on.	Ne menye nenema o la, ke yi edzi.
No one would want that.	Ame aɖeke madi nenema o.
He had to do everything himself.	Ele be eya ŋutɔ nawɔ nusianu.
I don’t want to talk	Nyemedi be maƒo nu o
I have to say everything was amazing	Ele nam be magblɔ be nusianu wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
Again, we know this will be the case.	Le afisia hã la, míenya be esia anɔ nenema.
We didn’t have time.	Vovo menɔ mía ŋu o.
I barely recognized my voice	Ƒã hafi mekpɔ nye gbe dze sii
I needed to know more about it	Ehiã be manya nu geɖe tso eŋu
And yet, it is important.	Eye ke hã, ele vevie.
I remember being sick	Meɖo ŋku edzi be medze dɔ
I think that could be a lost opportunity.	Mesusu be ema ate ŋu anye mɔnukpɔkpɔ si bu.
There is no issue between them.	Nya aɖeke mele wo dome o.
I was probably just a bad person.	Anɔ eme be ame si mewɔa nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu nyuie o koe menye.
I'm not sure how it got there.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi wòwɔ va ɖo afima dzi o.
The same is true of.	Nenema ke wòle le.
I always seem to have some time to go	Edze abe ɣeyiɣi aɖe nɔa asinye ɣesiaɣi be mayi ene
I had been eating well	Menɔ nu ɖum nyuie kpɔ
This is a new era.	Ɣeyiɣi yeye aɖee nye esia.
I reached out a hand through it	Medo asi aɖe to eme
I actually liked that part of it	Le nyateƒe me la, eƒe akpa ma dze ŋunye
I'm sure there have been some problems	Meka ɖe edzi be kuxi aɖewo do mo ɖa
I think he’s really cute	Mesusu be eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ

You’ll always have a place there, you know.	Teƒe anɔ asiwò le afima ɣesiaɣi, ènya.
And you should too.	Eye ele be wò hã.
I doubt it is possible.	Meke ɖi be anya wɔ.
But it could be the opposite.	Gake ate ŋu anye nusi to vovo kura.
Not very receptive.	Menye ame si xɔa nu nyuie kura o.
But when I’m trying to do that, it’s giving me an error.	Gake ne mele agbagba dzem be mawɔ ema la, ele vodada nam.
I can operate on him	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ nɛ
No one was really in charge.	Ame aɖeke menɔ dɔa dzi kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I want to be happy.	Medi be makpɔ dzidzɔ.
I had to go further than that	Ele be mayi ŋgɔ wu ema
I didn’t know there was so much to it	Nyemenya be nu geɖe ŋutɔ le eme o
I fell once, twice.	Medze anyi zi ɖeka, zi eve.
I couldn’t trust myself to speak the right language	Nyemete ŋu ka ɖe ɖokuinye dzi be mado gbe si sɔ o
I don’t know what else to do or say	Nyemenya nu bubu si mawɔ alo agblɔ o
I needed that little help	Mehiã na kpekpeɖeŋu sue ma
I wasn’t trying to, but it happened	Menye ɖe menɔ agbagba dzem be mawɔe o, gake edzɔ

And that seems right.	Eye edze abe esia sɔ ene.
I belong here with them	Menye afisia tɔ kpli wo
He was too interested.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme akpa.
Keep going and going.	Yi edzi yi.
I felt wonderful about it	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ le eŋu
The air was like rock.	Ya la nɔ abe kpe ene.
But this person understands nothing of that.	Gake ame sia mese naneke gɔme tso ema ŋu o.
However, no one may be.	Ke hã, ate ŋu adzɔ be ame aɖeke mele nenema o.
He didn’t get them.	Mexɔ wo o.
I know where they are.	Menya afisi wole.
I decided to provoke him a little	Meɖoe be mado dziku nɛ vie
Be able to see them.	Te ŋu kpɔa wo.
Take what you want.	Tsɔ nusi dim nèle.
I'll try that.	Mate ema kpɔ.
I’m glad he’s here	Edzɔ dzi nam be ele afisia
That problem can be of any kind.	Kuxi ma ate ŋu anye ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe.
There are some obvious reasons for this.	Susu aɖewo li siwo dze ƒã be esia tae.
He didn’t see anyone there.	Mekpɔ ame aɖeke le afima o.
We have thousands of things to do.	Nu akpe geɖe le mía si míawɔ.
It’s just that way.	Ðeko wòle nenema.
He seemed to have an idea	Edze abe susu aɖe va nɔ susu me nɛ ene
Now, everyone else is seeing the same thing.	Fifia, ame bubu ɖesiaɖe le nu ɖeka ma ke kpɔm.
It’s got you.	Ewɔ mo.
He will explain himself	Aɖe eɖokui me
It’s not just a minor issue.	Menye nya sue aɖe ko o.
But a machine can.	Gake mɔ̃ aɖe ate ŋui.
I knew yesterday morning	Menya etsɔ ŋdi
He could have said that.	Ate ŋu agblɔ nya ma hafi.
I already knew where they were going	Menya afi si yim wole xoxo
Everything seemed to go wrong.	Edze abe nusianu me gblẽ ene.
But now he seems like a nice guy.	Gake fifia la, edze abe ŋutsu nyui aɖee wònye ene.
I don’t know where they are	Nyemenya afisi wole o
That phase will take a few days.	Akpa ma axɔ ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo.
That’s the easy part.	Emae nye akpa si le bɔbɔe la.
For seemingly no reason.	Le nusi dze abe susu aɖeke meli o ene ta.
If that doesn't work, try another device.	Ne ema mewɔ dɔ o la, ke te mɔ̃ bubu aɖe kpɔ.
I have been single for a long time.	Menye tre ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
This made me very worried.	Esia na metsi dzi vevie.
I can’t go further than that.	Nyemate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu ema o.
It’s a strategy.	Enye aɖaŋu aɖe.
I was nervous, that much was true	Metsi dzodzodzoe, nu geɖe ma nye nyateƒe
His face was orderly.	Eƒe mo nɔ ɖoɖo nu.
But I do miss you	Gake mesusu wò ya
I think this is true	Mesusu be nya sia nye nyateƒe
I was angry about that too	Nye hã medo dziku ɖe ema ŋu
This is a great day.	Esia nye ŋkeke gã aɖe.
That surprised me a lot.	Ema wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I know when he asks for something	Menya ne ele nane biam
I have a lot of news for them	Nya geɖe le asinye na wo
I have a lot of things to do	Nu geɖe le asinye mawɔ be mawɔ
He can’t, he can’t, he can’t.	Mate ŋui o, mate ŋui o, mate ŋui o.
He doesn’t make any mistakes.	Mewɔa vodada aɖeke o.
They are like our people back home.	Wole abe míaƒe ame siwo le aƒeme ene.
But there was no one there.	Gake ame aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I can’t allow it	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ ɖe eŋu o
But there’s a time and a place for that.	Gake ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe aɖe le ema ŋu.
A different situation.	Nɔnɔme si to vovo.
We’re doing really well.	Míele edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But it didn’t work.	Gake mewɔ dɔ o.
He could not leave his house.	Mete ŋu do le eƒe aƒeme o.
My life is not in them.	Nye agbe mele wo me o.
I have enough blood	Ʋu si sɔ gbɔ le asinye
I can’t do anything else	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke wu ema o
I want to come with you	Medi be mava kpli wò
I could have someone else at that school	Ame bubu aɖe ate ŋu anɔ asinye le suku ma me
Last night, too.	Etsɔ zã hã.
Go back to school.	Trɔ yi suku.
Live.	Nɔ agbe.
I think that’s you	Mesusu be wòe nye ema
I can’t find many words today	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nya geɖe egbea o
Take good care of them.	Lé be na wo nyuie.
I can’t see anyone else	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ame bubu o
I couldn’t prove anything to the police	Nyemete ŋu ɖo kpe naneke dzi na kpovitɔwo o
I have nothing bad to say about them.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖeke mele asinye le wo ŋu o.
I want to say something	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖe
I don’t want this for you	Nyemedi esia na wò o
I have understood that.	Mese nya ma gɔme kpɔ.
I can’t figure out what it is	Nyemate ŋu anya nusi wònye o
I am the real thing	Nyee nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ
I'm just angry, but not at you	Ðeko medo dziku, gake menye ɖe ŋuwò o
I needed a replacement	Mehiã ame aɖe si axɔ ɖe eteƒe
I got too much.	Mexɔ nu geɖe akpa.
I would like to be like that now.	Madi be manɔ nenema fifia.
I would have loved to meet them all in person	Anye ne adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mado go wo katã ŋutɔŋutɔ
Maybe I can’t lead things	Ðewohĩ nyemate ŋu axɔ ŋgɔ na nuwo o
I hope you are satisfied	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wò dzi dze eme
I thought the word was out about me	Mesusu be nya la do go tso ŋunye
I have a problem with it.	Kuxi aɖe le ŋunye.
I wonder now what will happen to me	Mebia ɖokuinye azɔ be nukae adzɔ ɖe dzinye hã
I knew what was coming	Menya nusi gbɔna
I often wondered what it was like for him	Mebiaa ɖokuinye zi geɖe be aleke wòle nɛ hã
He expected nothing else.	Mekpɔ mɔ na nu bubu aɖeke o.
Forget being nice.	Ŋlɔ ame nyui wɔwɔ be.
But there was a bit of a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖe nɔ anyi vie.
He will explain himself.	Aɖe eɖokui me.
And it worked well.	Eye ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
That’s my whole point.	Emae nye nye nya bliboa.
Things are messed up.	Nuwo me gblẽ.
I must be doing something wrong	Anɔ eme be mele nu gbegblẽ aɖe wɔm
I’m not in a hurry at all	Nyemele du dzi kura o
I took a few steps up	Meɖe afɔ ʋɛ aɖewo yi dzi
People just do things.	Ðeko amewo wɔa nuwo.
I remember some of them	Meɖo ŋku wo dometɔ aɖewo dzi
We are in it.	Míele eme.
He had to act quickly.	Ele nɛ be wòawɔ nu kaba.
My last chance.	Nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ mamlɛtɔ.
But there was clearly someone in the house.	Gake edze ƒã be ame aɖe nɔ aƒea me.
I looked past him and saw nothing	Mekpɔ nu to eŋu eye nyemekpɔ naneke o
I want to tell you more	Medi be magblɔ nya geɖe wu na mi
Use them once, throw them away.	Zã wo zi ɖeka, tsɔ wo ƒu gbe.
I don’t mean to offend you	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mado dziku na wò o
It began to bother him.	Edze egɔme nɔ fu ɖem nɛ.
I wondered how she would make herself out of it	Mebia ɖokuinye be aleke wòawɔ eɖokui le eme hã
I know what he’s going to do	Menya nu si wòawɔ
It's a bit much.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ vie.
Or on anyone else.	Alo ɖe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe dzi.
I don’t understand your situation	Nyemese wò nɔnɔme gɔme o
I can’t imagine myself enjoying it enough	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye le susu me be mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe o
I can understand that too	Mate ŋu ase ema hã gɔme
I have nothing to say	Naneke mele asinye magblɔ o
There are many things we don’t know.	Nu geɖe li siwo míenya o.
I don’t want to get too close anyway	Nyemedi be mate ɖe eŋu akpa le mɔ aɖeke nu o
I couldn’t take any pleasure in it	Nyemete ŋu xɔ dzidzɔ aɖeke le eme o
This is too much.	Esia sɔ gbɔ akpa.
But four years is a long time.	Gake ƒe ene nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
I grew up here, through it all	Metsi le afisia, to wo katã me
My mind is clear and imaginative.	Nye susu me kɔ eye mewɔa nu le susu me.
I wondered how many hours had passed	Mebia ɖokuinye be gaƒoƒo nenie va yi hã
It's right here, and there's really something on it.	Ele afisia tututu, eye nane le edzi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I was just a little nervous	Ðeko metsi dzodzodzoe vie
I was never sure	Nyemeka ɖe edzi gbeɖe o
And his face made me worry.	Eye eƒe mo na metsi dzi.
I know all about that one too	Nye hã menya nu tso ɖeka ma ŋu katã
I gave up on that.	Meɖe asi le nya ma ŋu.
The way things are.	Ale si nuwo le.
I remember the whole thing now	Meɖo ŋku nu bliboa dzi azɔ
He would have done the same.	Anye ne ewɔ nenema ke hafi.
This seems to be a rule.	Edze abe esia nye se aɖe ene.
Or anyone, really.	Alo ame sia ame, le nyateƒe me.
I will be in it	Manɔ anyi le eme
And yet it is here.	Eye ke hã ele afisia.
I heard my name over and over again.	Mese nye ŋkɔ zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I don’t want to stay home.	Nyemedi be manɔ aƒeme o.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
We all have the same opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ ɖekae le mí katã si.
For his dog.	Na eƒe avu.
Just like it could be anyone.	Abe alesi wòate ŋu anye ame sia ame ene.
None of them have any money.	Ga aɖeke mele wo dometɔ aɖeke si o.
It makes no sense to me.	Susu aɖeke mele eŋu nam o.
Now it seems to be working fine.	Fifia edze abe ele dɔ wɔm nyuie ene.
It seemed so small.	Edze abe ɖe wòle sue ŋutɔ ene.
Maybe it’s just me.	Ðewohĩ nye koe.
He is a man of good possibilities .	Enye ŋutsu si ate ŋu adzɔ nyuie .
I know this won’t be easy	Menya be esia manɔ bɔbɔe o
If for some reason.	Ne susu aɖe tae.
I think that says two things.	Mesusu be ema gblɔ nya eve aɖewo.
It’s not small, it’s not big.	Menye nu sue aɖee wònye o, menye gã o.
I can be happy.	Mete ŋu kpɔa dzidzɔ.
I'll probably do that tomorrow	Anɔ eme be mawɔe nenema etsɔ
I felt it was all so clear	Mese le ɖokuinye me be wo katã me kɔ ale gbegbe
He gave her everything he had.	Etsɔ nu siwo katã le esi la nɛ.
People weren’t happy.	Amewo mekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
Many people worked with him.	Ame geɖe wɔ dɔ kplii.
You can’t tell how many.	Màte ŋu anya nenie o.
I just want to be in shape	Ðeko medi be manɔ nɔnɔme nyui me
That was a house.	Aƒe aɖee nye ema.
He himself wasn’t sure.	Eya ŋutɔ meka ɖe edzi o.
I could barely hold my sword	Nyemete ŋu lé nye yi la ɖe asi kura o
I want to get out of here.	Medi be mado le afisia.
It could be hours.	Ate ŋu anye gaƒoƒo geɖe.
I think he might have been surprised	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ewɔ nuku nɛ hafi
I was amazed at how easy it was	Ale si wònɔ bɔbɔe la wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
A tiny little thing.	Nu sue aɖe si le sue ŋutɔ.
I think that’s a good idea	Mesusu be susu nyui aɖee nye ema
I said take the money	Megblɔ be xɔ ga la
I was curious about the food there.	Medi vevie be manya nuɖuɖu si le afima.
I think that could be a bad thing.	Mesusu be ema ate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ.
Try to keep that in mind.	Dze agbagba nya ma nanɔ susu me na wò.
Few people have that opportunity.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe mɔnukpɔkpɔ ma si.
I want to cover so many ideas	Medi be maƒo nu tso susu geɖe ŋutɔ ŋu
His mind was impressive.	Eƒe susu wɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
I don’t see you here.	Nyemekpɔ wò le afisia o.
It is a personal matter.	Enye ame ŋutɔ ƒe nya.
I'm looking for a place	Mele teƒe dim
We’re not going to do it overnight.	Míele ewɔ ge le zã ɖeka me o.
It would be great for him.	Anye nu gã aɖe nɛ ŋutɔ.
I was equally concerned.	Nye hã metsi dzi ɖo nenema ke.
I know what we’re going to do tomorrow	Menya nusi míawɔ etsɔ
I don’t see you here	Nyemekpɔ wò le afisia o
It might eventually eliminate them all, after all.	Ðewohĩ aɖe wo katã ɖa mlɔeba, le nyateƒe me.
He is eating my food.	Ele nye nu ɖum.
It really is too much of a good thing.	Enye nu nyui aɖe si gbɔ eme akpa ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He filed a lawsuit.	Etsɔ nya ɖe amewo ŋu le se nu.
I just blinked this time	Ðeko meɖe ŋku ɖe nu ŋu zi sia
Accordingly, he is surprised by himself.	Le esia nu la, eya ŋutɔ ƒe nu wɔa nuku nɛ.
I should have explained everything to you.	Ðe wòle be maɖe nusianu me na wò hafi.
I want to know what happened last year	Medi be manya nusi dzɔ le ƒe si va yi me
Every time things went well.	Ɣesiaɣi la, nuwo yi edzi nyuie.
He is going to use you in a big way.	Ele wò zã ge le mɔ gã aɖe nu.
I can’t let them go	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le wo ŋu o
I wonder who is there now	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be amekae le afima fifia hã
You can rely on it.	Àte ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe eŋu.
This is a very unprofessional project, at all.	Esia nye dɔ si mewɔ ɖeka kple dɔa o ŋutɔ, kura.
Looks like I got into some money	Edze abe meva ge ɖe ga aɖewo me ene
But now, now.	Gake fifia ya, fifia.
I couldn’t for the life of me figure out what it was.	Nyemete ŋu bu nusi wònye ŋu na nye agbe o.
I think he has an idea there	Mesusu be susu aɖe le esi le afima
You are one of them	Ènye wo dometɔ ɖeka
And ‘I’ is definitely the right word.	Eye ‘nye’ nye nya si sɔ godoo.
A couple of jobs have worked for me	Dɔ eve aɖewo wɔ dɔ nam kpɔ
I didn’t know anything in school either	Nyemenya naneke le suku hã o
I have to stay home once in a while	Ele be manɔ aƒeme zi ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi aɖewo me
Help was on the way.	Kpekpeɖeŋu nɔ mɔ dzi.
I trust these people	Meka ɖe ame siawo dzi
It doesn’t fit together.	Mewɔa ɖeka o.
There will be a tomorrow.	Etsɔ aɖe anɔ anyi.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
I felt he deserved it	Mese le ɖokuinye me be edze nɛ
But there is nothing real in them.	Gake naneke ŋutɔŋutɔ mele wo me o.
You have nothing to do.	Naneke mele asiwò nàwɔ o.
I can’t help but be impressed by this	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke wu esia ƒe nu wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye o
A car drove down the dirt road.	Ʋu aɖe to mɔ si dzi ke le la dzi.
I was ready to let go	Menɔ klalo be maɖe asi le eŋu
I can’t do that to her.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma ɖe eŋu o.
Add water if necessary.	Tsɔ tsi de eme ne ehiã.
I can see why you live alone now	Mete ŋu kpɔ nusita wò ɖeka nèle agbe fifia
Everything was just the same.	Nusianu nɔ ɖeka ko.
He knew nothing about them.	Menya naneke tso wo ŋu o.
I prefer that way	Mɔ ma nyo nam wu
It seems impossible.	Edze abe ɖe mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.
The status quo should work in the same way.	Ele be nɔnɔme si li fifia nawɔ dɔ le mɔ ma ke nu.
He really didn’t know what to do.	Le nyateƒe me la, menya nusi wòawɔ o.
The outcome is far from certain.	Nusi ado tso eme la meka ɖe edzi kura o.
But it’s not working.	Gake mele dɔ wɔm o.
And never one like this.	Eye ɖeka aɖeke si le abe esia ene gbeɖe o.
I could almost see in his mind	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu le eƒe susu me kloe
In fact, that is true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nya ma nye nyateƒe.
I still had no children	Vi aɖeke menɔ asinye kokoko
We, that and, often.	Mí, be kple, zi geɖe.
I can’t give you advice from there	Nyemate ŋu aɖo aɖaŋu na wò tso afima o
I know we can win this year	Menya be míate ŋu aɖu dzi le ƒe sia me
I am definitely missing something.	Nane le to yim nam godoo.
I wondered what would happen after me	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae adzɔ le nye megbe hã
I can’t save anyone	Nyemate ŋu aɖe ame aɖeke o
And that can happen.	Eye ema ate ŋu adzɔ.
I should have never done it	Mele be mawɔe gbeɖe o hafi
I can stay there.	Mate ŋu anɔ afima.
I hope to get out of here too	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mado le afisia hã
I was so close this time	Mete ɖe ŋunye ale gbegbe zi sia
I remember him from when he was with us.	Meɖo ŋku edzi tso esime wònɔ mía gbɔ.
There are people like this.	Ame aɖewo li siwo le abe esia ene.
I was there for them	Menɔ afima na wo
But this is most likely not the case.	Gake anɔ eme godoo be esia mele nenema o.
I could almost try them on	Mete ŋu te wo kpɔ kloe
I don’t want to do anything more	Nyemedi be mawɔ naneke wu ema o
I don’t know about any timeline.	Nyemenya nu tso ɣeyiɣi ƒe ɖoɖo aɖeke ŋu o.
I’m glad you’re doing better now.	Edzɔ dzi nam be èle edzi dzem nyuie wu fifia.
I would love to stay here.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be manɔ afisia.
Guess it could have been a dog.	Bu eŋu kpɔ be ate ŋu anye avu hafi.
I was just too surprised	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku nam akpa
I was looking forward to going home	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm vevie be mayi aƒeme
I have a house here.	Aƒe le asinye le afisia.
Two sides can say	Akpa eve ate ŋu agblɔ
But, there are two problems with that.	Gake, kuxi eve le ema ŋu.
He did not know where he was.	Menya afi si wòle o.
I will definitely try this	Mate esia kpɔ godoo
You are not important.	Mèle vevie o.
I’ve never seen that happen.	Nyemekpɔ nu ma dzɔ kpɔ o.
I found the opposite	Mekpɔ nusi to vovo na ema
I knew what he wanted.	Menya nusi dim wònɔ.
Nothing was as he expected.	Naneke menɔ abe alesi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm ene o.
Everyone was surprised.	Ewɔ nuku na amesiame.
Where they are.	Afisi wole.
Come and join us!.	Va kpe ɖe mía ŋu!.
And you can’t just do it.	Eye màte ŋu awɔe ko o.
I think time is important to him	Mesusu be ɣeyiɣi le vevie nɛ
I had to take action	Ele nam be maɖe afɔ
I couldn’t do one if my life depended on it	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ɖeka nenye be nye agbe nɔ te ɖe edzi o
The reason for this is not clear.	Nusi gbɔ esia tso la medze ƒã o.
A man entered the room	Ŋutsu aɖe ge ɖe xɔa me
And at some point.	Eye le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me.
In fact, it happened once before.	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ zi ɖeka do ŋgɔ.
It worked well for him.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie nɛ.
Please understand that this process will continue	Taflatse se egɔme be ɖoɖo sia ayi edzi
He and she .	Eya kple eya .
Part of me expected this outcome	Nye akpa aɖe nɔ mɔ kpɔm na nusi ado tso eme alea
That’s for life.	Ema nye agbe ta.
There was one condition.	Nɔnɔme ɖeka aɖe nɔ anyi.
I think that’s a good idea	Mesusu be susu nyui aɖee nye ema
He will be so angry.	Ado dziku ale gbegbe.
I wish this was more consistent	Ne ɖe esia nawɔ ɖeka wu la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
These people dress well.	Ame siawo doa awu nyuie.
I had a few things to do	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ asinye mawɔ
I could have told him everything	Anye ne mate ŋu agblɔ nya sia nya nɛ hafi
When did this happen.	Ɣekaɣie esia dzɔ.
I didn’t know they were in it	Nyemenya be wole eme o
Maybe as early as next month.	Ðewohĩ anye ɣleti si gbɔna me ke.
That seemed difficult for him.	Edze abe ema sesẽ nɛ ene.
Please leave a comment if you can.	Taflatse gblẽ nya aɖe ɖi ne àte ŋui.

Some parts are missing.	Akpa aɖewo bu.

One of them is the date and time.	Wo dometɔ ɖekae nye ŋkeke kple gaƒoƒo.
Something is seriously wrong.	Nane gblẽ vevie.

Both here and there.	Le afisia kple afima siaa.

But two things are clear.	Gake nu eve aɖewo me kɔ nyuie.
Many lives depend on it.	Ame geɖe ƒe agbe nɔ te ɖe edzi.
I'm just as invested in this as you are	Metsɔ ga geɖe de esia me abe wò ke ene
I just think it’s all a bit much	Ðeko mesusu be nu siawo katã sɔ gbɔ vie
Maybe it will get better.	Ðewohĩ anyo ɖe edzi.

With this man who is now dead.	Kple ŋutsu sia si ku fifia.
And that’s what it is.	Eye emae nye ema.
I don’t want anything to do with it.	Nyemedi be naneke nanɔ asinye le eŋu o.
Several times before.	Zi geɖe do ŋgɔ.
It is very important for the job	Ele vevie ŋutɔ na dɔa wɔwɔ
I tried to be like everyone else	Medze agbagba be manɔ abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene
He can handle a difficult situation.	Ate ŋu akpɔ nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe gbɔ.
I think it impressed me	Mesusu be ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
I just wasn’t happy.	Ðeko nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
He was a great guy.	Enye ŋutsu gã aɖe.
I couldn’t tell which one felt worse.	Nyemete ŋu nya wo dometɔ si se le eɖokui me be yeƒe lãme gblẽ wu o.
I had to see everything	Ele be makpɔ nusianu
No one will protect us.	Ame aɖeke makpɔ mía ta o.

His bearded morning face stared back at him.	Eƒe ŋdi mo si ƒe ɖa le abe ɖa ene la trɔ ŋku ɖe eŋu.

I had no idea what had just happened to my life	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ ɖe nye agbe dzi teti koe nye ema o

He couldn’t do it.	Mete ŋu wɔe o.

I’m sorry for you, too.	Meɖe kuku na wò hã.
I could feel myself getting angry again	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me be megale dziku dom ake
Everyone comes to be very happy.	Amesiame va kpɔa dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
In fact, this would be good for everyone.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia anyo na amesiame.
I wasn’t sure what he wanted	Nyemeka ɖe nusi dim wònɔ dzi o
I can only rely on myself after all	Ðeko mate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu le nuwo katã megbe

You know he was having a tough time.	Ènya be ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe me tom wònɔ.

I don’t know if you’ll enjoy this.	Nyemenya nenye be esia ado dzidzɔ na wò o.
Quite the opposite.	Nusi to vovo kura na emae.
I can’t sit there, with that, anymore	Nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi ɖe afima, kple ema, azɔ o
But in reality, this cannot be the case.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, esia mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
This is what these people believe.	Esia nye nusi dzi ame siawo xɔ se.
He looked tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ene.
I know when something is wrong	Menya ne nane gblẽ
In fact, this is not the case.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia mele nenema o.
On that day.	Le ŋkeke ma dzi.
If anyone can help me.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye la.
I don’t know how to do it	Nyemenya ale si mawɔe o
We are there with him.	Míele afima kplii.
There is something for everyone and every age.	Nane le eme na amesiame kple ƒe ɖesiaɖe.
We can arrange for it.	Míate ŋu awɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
I wanted to see his face	Medi be makpɔ eƒe mo
I knew what was going on	Menya nusi nɔ edzi yim
It seems to be the same.	Edze abe nenema ke ene.
He doesn't pretend to be in the room though	Mewɔa abe ɖe mele xɔa me o ene gake
It will never come my way.	Mava nye mɔ dzi gbeɖe o.
I want more done	Medi be woawɔ nu geɖe wu
He began to do more royal duties	Edze fia ƒe dɔ geɖe wu wɔwɔ gɔme
It’s a great little project.	Enye dɔ sue gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I have four children.	Vi ene le asinye.
I hope this helps me.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia akpe ɖe ŋunye.
I just want to know about one thing	Ðeko medi be manya nu tso nu ɖeka ŋu
How can it help me? 	Aleke wòate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye?
Do something wrong.	Wɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
I think something bad is wrong with his head	Mesusu be nu gbegblẽ aɖe gblẽ le eƒe ta ŋu
I didn’t feel like I had anything left.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be naneke megale asinye o.
He's going to catch you.	Ele wò lé ge.
I can’t speak properly.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu nyuie o.
I had to do something.	Ele be mawɔ nane.
He would not have taken his own life.	Anye ne maɖe eya ŋutɔ ƒe agbe ɖa o.
This is not an easy task.	Esia menye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖeke o.
I think this post is over	Mesusu be nya sia wu enu
Depending on whether.	Le nenye be...
Know what you are eating.	Nya nu si ɖum nèle.
I would love to have one	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ne ɖeka nanɔ asinye
No one we don’t know.	Ame aɖeke si míenya o.
I got along just as well as you did.	Meva nɔ agbe nyuie abe wò ke ene.
You never know what someone else is going through.	Mènya nusi me tom ame bubu le gbeɖe o.
I know what’s going on now	Menya nusi le edzi yim fifia
I planned it all out	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe wo katã ŋu
I can’t really remember	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I can’t quite control it through food	Nyemate ŋu aɖu edzi tututu to nuɖuɖu me o
I can’t explain this	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nya sia me o
I'm not doing well at all.	Nyemele edzi dzem nyuie kura o.
I couldn’t resist that	Nyemete ŋu tsi tre ɖe ema ŋu o
I just need to know one quick thing	Ðeko wòle be manya nu ɖeka si woawɔ kaba
Try them all out.	Te wo katã kpɔ.
I'd better do it now.	Anyo be mawɔe fifia.
A thousand years or more	Ƒe akpe ɖeka alo esi wu nenema
Maybe I still have that chance.	Ðewohĩ mɔnukpɔkpɔ ma gakpɔtɔ le asinye.
We are doing some great things.	Míele nu gã aɖewo wɔm.
From the very first day.	Tso ŋkeke gbãtɔ dzi.
I think they caught fire in the afternoon	Mesusu be dzo dze wo le ŋdɔ me
That’s great, it really is.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ, ele nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I can’t say much more right now	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe wu fifia o
I'm looking forward to that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na ema.
I don’t know how to be a man	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ anye ŋutsu o
Maybe there was an opportunity.	Ðewohĩ mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe nɔ anyi.
They have no respect.	Bubu aɖeke mele wo ŋu o.
The car must be right.	Ele be ʋua nanɔ eteƒe.
It’s very easy and you can do that here.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ eye àte ŋu awɔ ema le afisia.
There are other potential problems.	Kuxi bubu siwo ate ŋu ado tso eme hã li.
What is looking at you.	Nukae le wò kpɔm.
Everyone is focused.	Amesiame ƒe susu nɔa nu ŋu.
Often, over and over again.	Zi geɖe la, zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
Part of me knew he wanted that too	Nye akpa aɖe nya be eya hã di nenema
That was clear enough.	Ema me kɔ nyuie ale gbegbe.
I couldn’t look at them	Nyemete ŋu lé ŋku ɖe wo ŋu o
I needed this done today	Mehiã be woawɔ esia egbea
I stayed behind.	Metsi megbe.
This just won’t work.	Ðeko esia mawɔ dɔ o.
Making metal is almost inexpensive.	Ga wɔwɔ mexɔ asi kura o kloe.
I think that would be awesome	Mesusu be ema awɔ nuku ŋutɔ
He was a good guy.	Ame nyui aɖee wònye.
There’s more in her mouth.	Nu geɖe wu le eƒe nu me.
I know he wouldn’t have let it go	Menya be maɖe asi le eŋu hafi o
I have little to tell you	Nu boo aɖeke mele asinye magblɔ na mi o
He couldn’t understand them.	Mete ŋu se wo gɔme o.
That wasn’t a man.	Menye ŋutsu aɖee nye ema o.
Very few others do.	Ame bubu ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔa esia.
I couldn’t hear or feel anything	Nyemete ŋu se naneke alo se naneke le ɖokuinye me o
I carried air with me	Metsɔ ya ɖe asi
It doesn’t matter what you say.	Nya si nàgblɔ la mehiã o.
I have never been so happy	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ nenema gbegbe kpɔ o
Which was the same.	Nusi hã nɔ nenema ke.
The issue remains.	Nya la gakpɔtɔ li.
I don’t know what else to do.	Nyemenya nu bubu si mawɔ o.
I would be there for everyone	Anye ne manɔ afima na amesiame
I didn’t expect him to say that	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be agblɔ nya ma o
He was really interested in that.	Etsɔ ɖe le nya ma me ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I couldn’t help it, but he didn’t	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o, gake mewɔ ɖe edzi o
Come back next week.	Trɔ va kwasiɖa si gbɔna me.
I know this very well	Menya esia nyuie ŋutɔ
It was just a minor issue.	Nya sue aɖe koe wònye.
I just drop by every once in a while	Ðeko meva nɔa afima zi ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi aɖewo me
Have more any time you want.	Na geɖe wu nanɔ asiwò ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe si nèdi.
I was definitely nervous	Metsi dzodzodzoe godoo
There was something about his face.	Nane nɔ eƒe mo.
At every opportunity.	Le mɔnukpɔkpɔ ɖesiaɖe me.
Perhaps that was discouraging.	Ðewohĩ ema na dzi ɖe le eme.
He could never do it.	Mate ŋu awɔe gbeɖe o.
I felt annoyed and angry at the same time.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be medo dziku eye medo dziku le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me.
But one year is enough.	Gake ƒe ɖeka sɔ gbɔ.
It needs longer than we have.	Ehiã ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe wu esi le mía si.
It doesn’t have to work.	Mehiã be wòawɔ dɔ o.
You are yourself.	Wò ŋutɔ nènye.
It doesn’t need to be processed.	Mehiã be woawɔ dɔ tso eŋu o.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He can do it here, though.	Ate ŋu awɔe le afisia, gake.
Not that that meant anything to him, of course.	Menye ɖe ema fia naneke nɛ o ya.
We all know that now.	Mí katã míenya esia fifia.
I know about that at least.	Menya nu tso nya ma ŋu ya teti.
What! 	Nu ka!
A man cannot live without them	Ŋutsu mate ŋu anɔ agbe wo manɔmee o
I couldn’t escape	Nyemete ŋu si dzo o
I just needed someone to talk to	Ðeko mehiã ame aɖe si maƒo nu kplii
I am better than that	Nyee nyo wu ema
You can tell that in many ways.	Àte ŋu anya ema le mɔ geɖe nu.
I'm sure it will work well.	Meka ɖe edzi be awɔ dɔ nyuie.
I would like to do that.	Madi be mawɔe nenema.
That’s not new to us.	Ema menye nu yeye na mí o.
I had enough on my mind	Nusi sɔ gbɔ nɔ susu me nam
You know they never had that.	Ènya be nu ma menɔ wo si kpɔ o.
Stay here as long as you want.	Nɔ afisia ɣeyiɣi didi si nèdi.
I want to finally find out where we are	Medi be mava nya afisi míele mlɔeba
I am the one holding you	Nyee nye ame si lé wò ɖe asi
I heard something about that, come to think of it	Mese nane tso ema ŋu, va bu eŋu
I need to talk to someone.	Ele be maƒo nu kple ame aɖe.
He needed a new location.	Ehiã teƒe yeye aɖe.
But none of these cases established such a clear rule.	Gake nya siawo dometɔ aɖeke meɖo se si me kɔ nenema gbegbe o.
It was just too soon.	Ðeko wònɔ kaba akpa.
It may not necessarily be the case.	Ðewohĩ manɔ nenema kokoko o.
I worked with them myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mewɔ dɔ kpli wo.
I remember that, but not much more	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi, gake menye nu geɖe wu ema o
The process took too long.	Dɔa wɔwɔ xɔ ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
I asked her to come closer	Mebia tso esi be wòate ɖe eŋu wu
The reverse is also true.	Nusi to vovo na ema hã nye nyateƒe.
Why? 	Nu ka ta?
I thought it would be simple.	Mesusu be anye nu bɔbɔe aɖe.
I don’t think there’s anything he can say	Mesusu be nya aɖeke meli wòate ŋu agblɔ o
The meeting would have been over.	Kpekpea anya wu enu hafi.
This is not personal.	Esia menye ame ŋutɔ tɔ o.
I have free time	Vovo mele ŋunye o le asinye
I was a big dog in that one	Avu gã aɖee menye le ɖeka ma me
More on that in the coming days.	Nu geɖe ava le ema ŋu le ŋkeke siwo gbɔna me.
Nothing could be more false.	Naneke mate ŋu anye alakpa wu ema o.
I admired him for that	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu le ema ta
I knew something like this was going to happen	Menya be nane si le abe esia ene ava dzɔ
You can go up, no problem.	Àte ŋu ayi dzi, kuxi aɖeke meli o.
I reached out to him.	Medo asi ɖe edzi.
Of everything, he would say.	Le nusianu ŋu la, agblɔ be.
I'll come with you	Mava kpli wò
I couldn’t think of it now	Nyemete ŋu bu eŋu fifia o
That was my opportunity.	Emae nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ nam.
He was the only one who did that.	Eya ɖeka koe wɔe nenema.
I missed what it was like	Ale si wònɔ la to ŋunye
I got to know about it.	Meva nya nu tso eŋu.
That he alone understood.	Be eya ɖeka koe se egɔme.
He seemed a little surprised.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ vie ene.
That’s not why.	Menye esia tae o.
I can’t do this alone	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔ esia o
You can’t prove a negative.	Màte ŋu aɖo kpe nya gbegblẽ aɖe dzi o.
There was no house.	Aƒe aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Some people get a job.	Ame aɖewo kpɔa dɔ.
That's just good.	Ema nyo ko.
It is not a condition.	Menye nɔnɔme aɖee wònye o.
And some others, too.	Eye ame bubu aɖewo hã.
Part of me wondered how he got there	Nye akpa aɖe nɔ eɖokui biam be aleke wòwɔ va ɖo afima hã
It is his own character.	Enye eya ŋutɔ ƒe nɔnɔme.
I quickly glanced back	Meɖe ŋku ɖe megbe kaba
But you can’t do anything about it.	Gake màte ŋu awɔ naneke tso eŋu o.
I could not stay in my house more than the night	Nyemete ŋu nɔ nye aƒe me wu zã la o
Come, stay and join us.	Va, nɔ anyi eye nàwɔ ɖeka kpli mí.
Everyone is trying so hard.	Amesiame le agbagba dzem vevie ale gbegbe.
All of these things have the same problem.	Nu siawo katã ƒe kuxi ɖeka le wo ŋu.
I don’t know much about it	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o
I handed over the money	Metsɔ ga la de asi na amewo
Only this year.	Ƒe sia me koe.
You know it’s there.	Ènya be ele afima.
Now clarify it.	Azɔ kɔ eme.
There should be nothing surprising about that.	Mele be naneke nawɔ nuku le ema ŋu o.
It’s just such an obvious thing.	Nu si dze ƒã alea koe wònye.
A little bit, anyway	Vi aɖe, le mɔ sia mɔ nu
And neither is he.	Eye eya hã mele nenema o.
That part is surreal.	Akpa ma nye nusi me susu mele o.
I have to be there tonight.	Ele be manɔ afima le zã sia me.
He wouldn’t have it at all.	Manɔ esi kura o.
I’m glad everything worked out	Edzɔ dzi nam be nusianu va yi nyuie
I couldn’t quite do that.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nu ma tututu o.
I approached him at night	Mete ɖe eŋu le zã me
I should have done something	Ðe wòle be mawɔ nane hafi
I don’t have the slightest idea	Nyemekpɔ susu sue aɖeke kura o
Ask a question from your own heart.	Bia nya si tso wò ŋutɔ wò dzi me.
I don’t know where his head is these days.	Nyemenya afisi eƒe ta le le ŋkeke siawo me o.
Maybe it doesn’t exist.	Ðewohĩ meli o.
I kept my promise to you	Mewɔ ɖe ŋugbe si medo na mi la dzi
It was really, really close.	Enye nusi te ɖe ame ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I was curious about them	Medi vevie be manya nu tso wo ŋu
But I’m so sure it doesn’t exist.	Gake meka ɖe edzi ale gbegbe be meli o.
But I did do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema.
I answered that question.	Meɖo eŋu na nya ma.
And keep your mind on it.	Eye wò susu nanɔ eŋu.
He is doing what needs to be done.	Ele nusi wòle be woawɔ la wɔm.
Just simple parallels.	Nu bɔbɔe siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo koe.
If we can do it, so can you.	Ne míate ŋu awɔe la, ke wò hã àte ŋu awɔe.
It didn’t take me long.	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke nam o.
The truth is quite different.	Nyateƒea ya to vovo kura.
House asked him.	Aƒe bia tso esi.
I couldn’t let go of it.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe asi le eŋu o.
Something went wrong several times.	Nane gblẽ zi geɖe.
I've got a bit of a liking for you	Mexɔ wò nu lé dzi nam vie
He must have a good reason.	Ele be susu nyui aɖe nanɔ esi.
I have so many memories here	Meɖo ŋku nu geɖe ŋutɔ dzi le afisia
He couldn’t control it.	Mete ŋu ɖu edzi o.
Maybe you could try that.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu ate ema kpɔ.
I could hear the truth	Mete ŋu se nyateƒea
And that’s why.	Eye esia tae.
I got that part right	Mekpɔ akpa ma nyuie
Maybe it’s not too late.	Ðewohĩ metsi megbe akpa o.
I couldn’t save them	Nyemete ŋu ɖe wo o
I have a missing piece to find	Akpa aɖe si bu la le asinye madi
You are hurt and ashamed.	Eve wò eye ŋu kpe wò.
But no one else will do anything about it	Gake ame bubu aɖeke mawɔ naneke le eŋu o
That’s still not easy.	Ema megale bɔbɔe kokoko o.
I knew something bad had happened back there	Menya be nu gbegblẽ aɖe dzɔ le megbe afima
In fact, there is no money.	Le nyateƒe me la, ga aɖeke meli o.
I know what kind of person you are	Menya ame si ƒomevi nènye
A great deal of it.	Akpa gã aɖe.
I know a really good place	Menya teƒe nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ
The wind came strongly.	Ya ƒo sesĩe va.
You are seeing the real thing.	Èle nu ŋutɔŋutɔ la kpɔm.
But he was a good kid.	Gake ɖevi nyui aɖee wònye.
I shouldn’t be doing this	Mele be manɔ esia wɔm o
I knew exactly what he was doing	Menya nu si tututu wɔm wònɔ
He never said anything else to me.	Megblɔ nya bubu aɖeke nam kpɔ o.
I know exactly where they are	Menya afisi tututu wole
I hope you are not	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mèle nenema o
And that he really never did.	Eye be le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
I almost didn’t want to come after this afternoon	Nyemedi kloe be mava le ŋdɔ sia megbe o
I don’t want to be anywhere near him	Nyemedi be manɔ afi aɖeke si te ɖe eŋu o
But he began to like her himself.	Gake eya ŋutɔ te eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
I'll come looking for you	Mava di wò
I am only a small part of it	Eƒe akpa sue aɖe koe menye
I have seen this too many times before	Mekpɔ esia zi gbɔ zi geɖe akpa va yi
He seemed very serious.	Edze abe etsɔ ɖe le eme vevie ŋutɔ ene.
I want to see your face	Medi be makpɔ wò mo
I knew that wouldn’t sit well with me.	Menya be ema manɔ anyi nam nyuie o.
He can’t help himself.	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe eɖokui ŋu o.
Something had happened.	Nu aɖe dzɔ kpɔ.
I have to work on all of them	Ele be mawɔ dɔ tso wo katã ŋu
There is nothing like this.	Naneke mele abe esia ene o.
Nothing worked for me.	Naneke mewɔ dɔ nam o.
We don’t know what to do with them.	Míenya nusi míawɔ ɖe wo ŋu o.
It was a small book.	Agbalẽ sue aɖee wònye.
I hope people can relate with it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be amewo ate ŋu ase egɔme kplii
He was a strong man, of course.	Enye ame sesẽ ya.
As if they were looking for something.	Abe ɖe wole nane dim ene.
This, of course, coincides with the following intuitive reasoning.	Esia sɔ kple susu si gbɔna si me kɔ nyuie ya.
And it might have worked.	Eye ɖewohĩ awɔ dɔ hafi.
I had a great time with you	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ kpli wò
I couldn’t find him, he couldn’t find me.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o, eya hã mete ŋu ke ɖe ŋunye o.
It is a lot of things.	Enye nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
There is a crazy idea here.	Susu si me susu mele o ye le afisia.
The end result was amazing.	Nusi do tso eme mlɔeba la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I remember feeling sick	Meɖo ŋku edzi be mese le ɖokuinye me be medze dɔ
Not a great one.	Menye gã aɖeke o.
I need to do some work there	Ele be mawɔ dɔ aɖewo le afima
Not now, not anymore.	Menye fifia o, menye azɔ o.
Food is very expensive.	Nuɖuɖu xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I really wanted to know where he was	Medi vevie be manya afi si wòle
I am having a good breakfast every morning.	Mele ŋdi nuɖuɖu nyui aɖe ɖum ŋdi sia ŋdi.
It’s relatively simple and distinctive	Eƒe nɔnɔme le bɔbɔe vie eye eƒe nɔnɔme to vovo
I'll see you.	Makpɔ wò.
I won’t have it.	Manɔ asinye o.
I do a very good job.	Mewɔa dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
Often, over and over again.	Zi geɖe la, zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
But if it's not working, it's not working.	Gake ne mele dɔ wɔm o la, ke mele dɔ wɔm o.
And it’s been a long time.	Eye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
It is a difficult problem.	Enye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
A year ago that wouldn’t have been the case	Ƒe ɖeka enye sia la, anye ne manɔ nenema o
Please help me with it.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye le eŋu.
As a result, a child died.	Le ema ta la, vi aɖe ku.
I don’t have to go on.	Mehiã be mayi edzi o.
A week later.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka megbe.
But this time, nothing came.	Gake fifia ya, naneke meva o.
I think it looks bad	Mesusu be edze nu gbegblẽ
Or sit on it.	Alo nɔ anyi ɖe edzi.
I just want to know what you think	Ðeko medi be manya nusi nèsusu
I asked him his name	Mebia eƒe ŋkɔ nɛ
Or it is, anyway.	Alo enye, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I highly doubt that.	Meke ɖi le nya ma ŋu ŋutɔ.
There must be some reason for this.	Ele be susu aɖewo nanɔ esia ta.
I know enough to do it	Menya nusi sɔ gbɔ be mate ŋu awɔe
I don’t know what that’s about	Nyemenya nusi ŋu nya ma ku ɖo o
Nothing at all came out of it.	Nya aɖeke kura meɖe tso eme o.
Do whatever you want.	Wɔ nu sia nu si nèdi.
Who will be the first to find it?.	Amekae anye ame gbãtɔ si ake ɖe eŋu?.
I had to try something	Ele be mate nane kpɔ
Not so today.	Menye nenema egbea o.
I’m glad I like you.	Edzɔ dzi nam be wò nu lé dzi nam.
In a way, it kind of is.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, ele nenema ƒomevi.
He was a good guy who was trying.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe si nɔ agbagba dzem.
I know I know what that is	Menya be menya nusi ema nye
No one else is going to do it for us.	Ame bubu aɖeke mele ewɔ ge na mí o.
I want to see everything good in a person	Medi be makpɔ nu nyui ɖesiaɖe le ame ŋu
I did this, too	Mewɔ esia hã
I don’t know where he is	Nyemenya afi si wòle o
Please look into this.	Taflatse lé ŋku ɖe esia ŋu.
I could never root for them	Nyemate ŋu aƒo ke ɖe to ɖe wo ta gbeɖe o
Past and present.	Tsã kple fifia.
I wanted to try something new	Medi be mate nu yeye aɖe kpɔ
I don’t know where he is	Nyemenya afi si wòle o
Life seems too short.	Edze abe agbe le kpuie akpa ene.
I really liked this dish	Nuɖuɖu sia dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
I don’t want to talk about the truth.	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso nyateƒea ŋu o.
But nevertheless.	Gake ke hã.
Please guide a little.	Taflatse fia mɔ vie.
And that is very true.	Eye nya ma nye nyateƒe ŋutɔ.
This is a very good one.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ.
I am sure he will expect me	Meka ɖe edzi be akpɔ mɔ nam
I like this new piece of yours.	Wò akpa yeye sia dze ŋunye.
I felt like he was fighting to get out	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ɖe wòle avu wɔm be mado go ene
He didn’t seem worried at all.	Edze abe metsi dzi kura o ene.
But I also do a lot of other things.	Gake mewɔa nu bubu geɖe hã.
From previous years, this is a very big day.	Tso ƒe siwo va yi me la, ŋkeke sia nye ŋkeke gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Please call him at home.	Taflatse ƒo ka nɛ le aƒeme.
Just ask us.	Bia mí ko.
A mistake there can be fatal, and very quickly.	Vodada le afima ate ŋu awu ame, eye wòawɔ kaba ŋutɔ.
And you can stay as long as you want.	Eye àte ŋu anɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi si nèdi.
I can’t do that to anyone else	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma ɖe ame bubu aɖeke ŋu o
It’s not just one thing.	Menye nu ɖeka koe wònye o.
There was no early or late death.	Ku kaba alo tsi megbe aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
But I do know this	Gake menya esia ya
He was just the kind of person he was.	Ame si ƒomevi wònye koe wònye.
I’m not fighting you.	Nyemele avu wɔm kpli wò o.
I can’t understand it either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu ase egɔme o
This seems to be a real thing.	Edze abe esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
I couldn’t keep my mouth shut	Nyemete ŋu nɔ nye nu ƒom o
I wonder if this is true	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe nya sia nye nyateƒe hã
He didn’t know anything.	Menya naneke o.
I am ready to solve these problems.	Mele klalo be makpɔ kuxi siawo gbɔ.
That made many people nervous.	Ema na ame geɖe tsi dzodzodzoe.
There didn’t seem to be time in that place.	Edze abe ɣeyiɣi menɔ teƒe ma o ene.
Everyone will know who you are and where you are.	Ame sia ame anya ame si nènye kple afi si nèle.
This is actually a good thing.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia nye nu nyui aɖe.
You’re in a place.	Èle teƒe aɖe.
Could it be that .	Ðe wòate ŋu anye be .
I just need time to figure this out	Ðeko mehiã ɣeyiɣi be makpɔ esia gbɔ
You are the one who makes them.	Wòe nye ame si wɔa wo.
There shouldn’t be any.	Mele be ɖeke nanɔ anyi o.
And please.	Eye taflatse.
And he’s satisfied.	Eye eƒe dzi dze eme.
I must have done something right	Anɔ eme be mewɔ nane nyuie
I will know if he is guilty	Manya nenye be enye ame si ɖi fɔ
I don’t know what that’s about	Nyemenya nusi ŋu nya ma ku ɖo o
I almost felt right at home	Mese le ɖokuinye me kloe be mele aƒeme tututu
I can see so much this way.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu geɖe ŋutɔ le mɔ sia nu.
That is no small task.	Ema menye dɔ sue aɖeke o.
I'd better stay.	Anyo be manɔ anyi.
I was just happy.	Ðeko mekpɔ dzidzɔ.
None of the men in the past had treated her that way.	Ŋutsu siwo nɔ eme va yi dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu alea o.
I'll harass you on that thread	Maɖe fu na wò le ka ma dzi
Do this all the time.	Wɔ esia ɣesiaɣi.
I don’t think it would be that much more complicated.	Nyemesusu be anye nusi me kɔ wu nenema gbegbe o.
From good hard work.	Tso dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ nyuie me.
The money, apart from anything else.	Ga la, to vovo na nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
I don’t know if you can or not	Nyemenya nenye be àte ŋui alo màte ŋui o
I’ve never felt that way about anyone	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema le ame aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o
I don’t want to talk about it	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso eŋu o
I hope this was helpful.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia kpe ɖe ŋunye.
To date, he has never had a problem.	Vaseɖe egbea la, kuxi aɖeke menɔ eŋu kpɔ o.
There was no reason for anything.	Susu aɖeke menɔ naneke ŋu o.
Usually.	Zi geɖe la.
A breeze blew behind him	Ya aɖe ƒo ɖe megbe nɛ
I want you to say something	Medi be nàgblɔ nya aɖe
I still can’t do it.	Nyemate ŋui kokoko o.
Clearly, things have changed.	Edze ƒã be nuwo trɔ.
Or it will come true.	Alo ava eme.
Not as it is now.	Menye abe alesi wòle fifia ene o.
They seem to be waiting.	Edze abe wole lalam ene.
This day is over, and a good one.	Ŋkeke sia wu enu, eye ŋkeke nyui aɖee.
I had the more important things on my mind	Nu siwo le vevie wu la nɔ susu me nam
I'm not sure what I like about it.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi doa dzidzɔ nam le eŋu dzi o.
I need you to do something for me	Mehiã be nàwɔ nane nam
I would say, do this, and he would do it.	Magblɔ be, wɔ esia, eye eya hã awɔe.
A man came out with a face	Ŋutsu aɖe do go kple mo
I want to do this just like him	Medi be mawɔ esia abe eya ke ene
I can get a piece of theirs	Mate ŋu axɔ wo tɔ ƒe akpa aɖe
I think it’s just one of them	Mesusu be wo dometɔ ɖeka koe wònye
And it went on and on.	Eye edzi yi edzi.
Maybe he had his mind on it.	Ðewohĩ eƒe susu nɔ eŋu.
I need the money today.	Mehiã ga la egbea.
There has never been an easy path.	Mɔ bɔbɔe aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
I could have been like that.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema hafi.
This is a great rule.	Esia nye se gã aɖe.
Nothing else seemed more important.	Nu bubu aɖeke medze abe ɖe wòle vevie wu ene o.
He needed to make a plan.	Ehiã be wòawɔ ɖoɖo aɖe.
If there is one.	Ne ɖe li la.
Also from the back.	Tso megbe hã.
I recognized one of them	Mekpɔ wo dometɔ ɖeka dze sii
I distanced myself from him	Meɖe ɖokuinye ɖa le eŋu
Actually, I am only one	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖeka koe menye
Write this down.	Ŋlɔ nya sia ɖi.
This is about what is right.	Esia ku ɖe nusi sɔ ŋu.
I don’t know how long he was there	Nyemenya ɣeyiɣi didi si wònɔ afima o
I do recognize you.	Mekpɔ wò dze sii ya.
I couldn’t have done it without all of you	Nyemate ŋu awɔe ne menye mi katã o
I did this to myself	Mewɔ esia ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu
That was a period of time.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I couldn’t believe them	Nyemete ŋu xɔ wo dzi se o
He was a good guy.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe.
I didn’t like any of them	Wo dometɔ aɖeke medze ŋunye o
They are working very hard on it.	Wole dɔ wɔm tso eŋu vevie ŋutɔ.
I just need to have you	Ðeko wòle be wò nanɔ asinye
I needed to explain, over and over again	Ehiã be maɖe eme, zi gbɔ zi geɖe
I am not okay with this.	Nyemele nyuie le esia ŋu.
I will talk to them.	Maƒo nu na wo.
I often wondered how he would live in that house	Mebiaa ɖokuinye zi geɖe be aleke wòawɔ anɔ aƒe ma me hã
I guess tomorrow is another day.	Mesusu be etsɔ nye ŋkeke bubu.
A voice seemed to speak head over my heart	Gbe aɖe dze abe ta ƒo nu ta nye dzi ene
I reached out to grab his hand but to no avail	Medo asi ɖa lé asi ɖe eŋu gake medze edzi o
I want to get rid of this as much as possible	Medi be maɖe esia ɖa alesi mate ŋui
I was trying to find the right words to say	Menɔ agbagba dzem be madi nya siwo sɔ magblɔ
Mary is from that town.	Maria tso du ma me.
No one else can know.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu anya o.
I felt a little nervous	Mese le ɖokuinye me be metsi dzodzodzoe vie
But you can get a glimpse of it.	Gake àte ŋu akpɔ eƒe akpa aɖe.
I don’t have to concentrate	Mehiã be nye susu nanɔ nu ŋu o
I stayed up all day	Menɔ ŋu ŋkeke bliboa katã
I did this on my own	Mewɔ esia le ɖokuinye si
I just don’t want to be alone all the time	Ðeko nyemedi be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi ɣesiaɣi o
I don’t know about it.	Nyemenya nu tso eŋu o.
Or you can make a great meal.	Alo àte ŋu awɔ nuɖuɖu gã aɖe.
I should be asking you that question	Ele be manɔ nya ma biam wò
That, may or may not.	Ema, ɖewohĩ mawɔe alo mawɔe hã o.
His form suggested a man.	Eƒe nɔnɔme do susu ɖa be ŋutsu aɖee.
Too much when this is going on.	Nu geɖe akpa ne esia le edzi yim.
I have been here many times	Meva afisia zi geɖe kpɔ
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe li siwo tae.
No one can deny them.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu agbe nu le wo gbɔ o.
My voice is fine.	Nye gbe le nyuie.
Yet this is anything but the truth.	Ke hã esia nye nusianu tsɔ wu nyateƒea.
It can’t be true.	Mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
And not without reason.	Eye menye susu manɔmee o.
It was just a surprise.	Nusi wɔ nuku koe wònye.
I am looking for some clothes for you.	Mele awu aɖewo dim na wò.
I have so much faith in you	Mexɔ wò dzi se ale gbegbe
I know what it means to lose a child	Menya nusi vi ku fia
You can’t let me go.	Màte ŋu aɖe asi le ŋunye o.
I have been there for a long time	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia mele afima
I think he was very interested	Mesusu be etsɔ ɖe le eme ŋutɔ
I heard that there.	Mese nya ma le afima.
I can see the content.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nya siwo le eme.
But there are some problems.	Gake kuxi aɖewo li.
And some people will, too.	Eye ame aɖewo hã awɔe nenema.
Find me a better one.	Di esi nyo wu nam.
You are my very first.	Wòe nye nye ame gbãtɔ ŋutɔ.
I don’t know anything about him or her	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu alo tso eŋu o
The loss is like.	Nusi bu la le abe.
The process will take hours.	Dɔa wɔwɔ axɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe.
It seems, somehow, simple.	Edze abe, le mɔ aɖe nu la, ele bɔbɔe ene.
It’s a whole new thing.	Enye nu yeye aɖe ŋutɔ.
That in itself is interesting.	Ema ŋutɔ doa dzidzɔ na ame.
I felt so small, so helpless	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nyemele sue ŋutɔ, nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o
He has no idea, really.	Susu aɖeke mele esi o, le nyateƒe me.
And now there will be two.	Eye fifia la, eve anɔ anyi.
I had no idea what was going on	Nyemenya nusi nɔ edzi yim o
This means everything.	Esia fia nusianu.
That doesn’t matter.	Ema mehiã o.
One way is obvious.	Mɔ ɖeka dze ƒã.
Not for some of them, at least.	Menye na wo dometɔ aɖewo ya teti o.
I think you know your stuff	Mesusu be ènya wò nuwo
I decided to keep going	Meɖoe be mayi edzi
I wonder who did it and why	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be amekae wɔe kple nukatae hã
I am very concerned about this problem.	Metsi dzi vevie ɖe kuxi sia ŋu.
Stay away from strangers.	Te ɖa le ame siwo mènya o la ŋu.
I only have the first thing	Nu gbãtɔ koe le asinye
I want to talk about that	Medi be maƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu
I got your attention	Mexɔ wò susu
It was a very big deal.	Enye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I promise, this is on and on	Medo ŋugbe be, esia le dzi kple dzi
I don’t want to say anything.	Nyemedi be magblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I spent the night at your house, worrying about him	Metsi wò aƒeme zã bliboa, eye metsi dzi ɖe eŋu
I had to protect myself in my own home	Ele be makpɔ ɖokuinye ta le nye ŋutɔ nye aƒe me
However this is not the case.	Ke hã esia mele alea o.
I have something better to do.	Nane si nyo wu le asinye mawɔ.
I’m worried about you	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò
That’s a lot of it.	Ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
He never needed another name.	Mehiã ŋkɔ bubu aɖeke gbeɖe o.
I said there would be none.	Megblɔ be ɖeke manɔ anyi o.
This lasted throughout the night	Esia nɔ anyi le zã bliboa me
I used to be an only child too	Nye hã nye ɖeka koe nye vi tsã
I was anxious to meet them	Metsi dzi be mado go wo
I wanted to take action	Medi be maɖe afɔ
I can’t tell if there’s anything to it	Nyemate ŋu anya ne nane le eme o
Maybe he can help us.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu akpe ɖe mía ŋu.
I don’t know anything about it	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o
I do have a mind.	Susu le asinye nyateƒe.
I was moving forward now	Menɔ ŋgɔ yim fifia
I can’t tell this to anyone	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya sia na ame aɖeke o
But in reality, this is not the case.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, esia mele nenema o.
I want to know more about it	Medi be manya nu geɖe tso eŋu
That’s our plan.	Emae nye míaƒe ɖoɖo.
I do like a problem	Mewɔa abe kuxi aɖe ene
There is a truth.	Nyateƒe li.
I have so much going on in my head right now.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le ta nam fifia.
I remember being very impressed	Meɖo ŋku edzi be ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
This becomes expensive.	Esia va xɔa ga geɖe.
Lots and lots of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe kple geɖe.
I knew they were waiting for something that would never come	Menya be wole lalam na nane si mava gbeɖe o
Please put that little gun away.	Taflatse tsɔ tu sue ma da ɖe teƒe aɖe.
I want you to do two things	Medi be nàwɔ nu eve
This is a good job.	Esia nye dɔ nyui aɖe.
I was here when this started	Menɔ afisia esime esia dze egɔme
He wasn’t supposed to do that.	Menye ɖe wòle be wòawɔ nenema o.
I am very concerned about this.	Metsi dzi ɖe nya sia ŋu ŋutɔ.
I think he is making a different impression	Mesusu be ele susu bubu aɖe wɔm
I wish I had done this sooner	Anye ne mewɔ esia kaba wu hafi
Exactly what happened.	Nusi tututu dzɔ.
It will pay off in the long run.	Aɖe vi le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe megbe.
It is happening in the complete opposite direction.	Ele edzi yim le mɔ si to vovo kura na ema nu.
I do everything for me.	Mewɔa nusianu nam.
I know everyone.	Menya amesiame.
I wondered what he had in mind	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae nɔ susu me nɛ hã
I felt something was missing	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nane bu
I did the same with him	Mewɔe nenema ke ɖe eŋu
I am not alone in this	Menye nye ɖeka koe le esia me o
But he will overcome it.	Gake aɖu edzi.
The whole thing made so much sense.	Susu aɖeke menɔ nya bliboa me o ale gbegbe.
This is a good place.	Esia nye teƒe nyui aɖe.
While we are here.	Esi míele afisia la.
I couldn’t remember how to speak	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku alesi maƒo nu dzi o
Here it doesn’t work.	Le afisia la, mewɔa dɔ o.
And he couldn’t go back.	Eye mete ŋu trɔ yi megbe o.
He won’t tell me why he’s here.	Magblɔ nusita wòle afisia nam o.
It will be there.	Anɔ afima.
I had to do this for him	Ele be mawɔ esia nɛ
I can’t make it work.	Nyemate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ o.
Everything.	Nu sia nu.
He had never met anyone quite like him.	Medo go ame aɖeke si sɔ kplii tututu kpɔ o.
I don’t want to go without you	Nyemedi be mayi wò manɔmee o
I can understand that	Mate ŋu ase nya ma gɔme
I’ll see things you can’t see	Makpɔ nu siwo màte ŋu akpɔ o
I think he’s really sick	Mesusu be edze dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ
This is a difficult time.	Ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖee nye esia.
His job was simple.	Eƒe dɔa nɔ bɔbɔe.
Everything will be new.	Nusianu anɔ yeye.
I could have done without it	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔe esia manɔmee hafi
I couldn’t hear anyone	Nyemete ŋu se ame aɖeke o
There is no timeline.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe ɖoɖo aɖeke meli o.

I didn’t hear you come in	Nyemese wò ge ɖe eme o
I didn’t see any, and I was satisfied	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke o, eye nye dzi dze eme
Everything is too clear.	Nusianu me kɔ akpa.
This doesn’t seem to make sense.	Edze abe susu mele esia me o ene.
I don’t see anything wrong with doing what you want to do.	Nyemekpɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke le nu si nèdi be yeawɔ la wɔwɔ me o.
And you said a lot of good things.	Eye ègblɔ nya nyui geɖe.
I don’t think he would mind.	Mesusu be maɖe fu nɛ o.
He will do what he has to do.	Awɔ nu si wòle be wòawɔ.
I am not among them.	Nyemele wo dome o.
To do so.	Be wòawɔ nenema.
I was driving alone and exhausted	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ ʋu ƒom eye ɖeɖi te ŋunye
He could not handle this himself.	Eya ŋutɔ mete ŋu kpɔ esia gbɔ o.
I don’t know his name.	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ o.
I can only cope with so much	Nu geɖe koe mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu nenema gbegbe
Pray a lot.	Do gbe ɖa geɖe.
I remember the look on his face	Meɖo ŋku ale si eƒe mo nɔ la dzi
I realized what must have happened	Mekpɔ nusi anya dzɔ la dze sii
But this place is different.	Gake teƒe sia to vovo.
I wasn’t free at all	Vovo menɔ ŋunye kura o
I can control it.	Mate ŋu aɖu edzi.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
What you did was right.	Nu si nèwɔ la sɔ.
I knew it would be good to come here	Menya be anyo be mava afisia
There was no car.	Ʋu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I headed to my room.	Meɖo ta nye xɔ me.
I hope everything is okay	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nusianu le nyuie
You need to plan ahead.	Ele be nàwɔ ɖoɖo do ŋgɔ.

But it wasn’t easy.	Gake menɔ bɔbɔe o.
This simply cannot be realistic.	Ðeko esia mate ŋu anye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I can’t escape this	Nyemate ŋu asi le esia nu o
I threw them out a week later.	Metsɔ wo ƒu gbe le kwasiɖa ɖeka megbe.
We are on the rope.	Míele ka la dzi.

I hope to find something very interesting	Mele mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ nane si ado dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
I always have time for you	Ɣeyiɣi nɔa asinye na wò ɣesiaɣi
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
I just stood there and didn’t know what to do	Ðeko metsi tre ɖe afima eye nyemenya nusi mawɔ o
No one told me his name.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ eƒe ŋkɔ nam o.
But I can’t remember now	Gake nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi fifia o
But we’ve been doing this for almost two weeks now.	Gake kwasiɖa eve kloe enye sia si míele esia wɔm.
I don’t want to go anywhere else	Nyemedi be mayi teƒe bubu aɖeke o
I don’t know about that.	Nyemenya nu tso ema ŋu o.
But it will be fine, trust me.	Gake anyo, ka ɖe dzinye.

I have another reason for being here	Susu bubu aɖe hã le asinye si tae mele afisia ɖo
Everyone here will always remember this moment.	Amesiame si le afisia aɖo ŋku ɣeyiɣi sia dzi ɣesiaɣi.
I don’t have to do any of it	Mehiã be mawɔ eƒe akpa aɖeke o
I felt the need to explain more	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ehiã be maɖe nu me geɖe wu
Please let me know what you want me to do.	Taflatse na manya nu si nèdi be mawɔ.
But he can’t get out anymore.	Gake mate ŋu ado go azɔ o.
People who really helped me, anyway.	Ame siwo kpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔŋutɔ, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Take your own kind.	Tsɔ wò ŋutɔ wò ƒomevi.

It’s definitely a great opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖee wònye godoo.

I had to hurry home	Ele be mawɔ kaba aɖo aƒeme
But he couldn’t.	Gake mete ŋui o.
But people who are alive, too.	Gake ame siwo le agbe, hã.
The role was almost too easy.	Akpa la wɔwɔ nɔ bɔbɔe akpa kloe.
Everyone is doing the same thing	Amesiame le nu ɖeka ma ke wɔm
Almost everyone was deeply impressed.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe amesiame kloe dzi vevie.
He couldn't hold back.	Mete ŋu lé nu ɖe ​​te o.
I finally got there, you know	Meva ɖo afima mlɔeba, ènya
No one has ever done it.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe kpɔ o.
This was not the case at all.	Esia menɔ alea kura o.
I can’t bear to watch any of them	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi akpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o
But I never saw any of them	Gake nyemekpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke kpɔ o
Work is going on in this direction.	Dɔ le edzi yim le mɔ sia nu.
More than that I wouldn’t do it myself.	Nusi wu ema menye nye ŋutɔ mawɔ o.
I think we have a home, you and me	Mesusu be aƒe le mía si, mía kple wò
People ask this question.	Amewo bia nya sia.
Explain it to you, if you can.	Ðe eme na wò, ne àte ŋui.
I can’t understand what’s wrong	Nyemate ŋu ase nusi gblẽ la gɔme o
I think you know how much that meant to me	Mesusu be ènya ale si gbegbe ema ɖe vi nam
He could never prove them.	Mete ŋu ɖo kpe wo dzi gbeɖe o.

Not this time either.	Menye zi sia hã o.
But there is that it is.	Gake li be ele nenema.
I couldn’t see anyone else, just him	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ ame bubu aɖeke o, eya koe

And neither did anyone.	Eye ame aɖeke hã mewɔe nenema o.

Yet this did not seem to be the case.	Ke hã edze abe alea menɔ alea o ene.

But there is only one part at any time.	Gake akpa ɖeka koe nɔa ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe me.

I was just doing my job.	Ðeko menɔ nye dɔ wɔm.

What would he have done anyway.	Nukae wòawɔ le mɔ sia mɔ nu hafi.
I’m sure there must be room there for you .	Meka ɖe edzi be ele be teƒe nanɔ afima na wò .
What you do is very important.	Nu si nàwɔ la le vevie ŋutɔ.
He had another place.	Teƒe bubu nɔ esi.

I can’t say how anyone could possibly know	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ alesi ame aɖeke ate ŋu anya o
I was just angry and I felt it	Ðeko medo dziku eye mese le ɖokuinye me
That just kind of happened.	Ðeko ema dzɔ le mɔ aɖe nu.

I just needed something else, different.	Ðeko mehiã nu bubu aɖe, si to vovo.

Maybe it will go, maybe it won’t.	Ðewohĩ ayi, ɖewohĩ mayi o.

I think you liked him	Mesusu be eƒe nu lé dzi na wò
Please tell me more about that.	Taflatse gblɔ nya geɖe nam tso ema ŋu.
I can’t allow that	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ ɖe ema ŋu o
It really is that simple in some cases.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe le go aɖewo me.
It’s a part of it.	Enye eƒe akpa aɖe.
It will help them.	Akpe ɖe wo ŋu.
Whatever you want to do, you can very much find.	Nusianu si nèdi be yeawɔ la, àte ŋu ake ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ.
I don’t know how to explain myself	Nyemenya alesi maɖe ɖokuinye me o
Something was wrong with them.	Nane nɔ wo ŋu tom.
About what actually happened.	Ku ɖe nusi dzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋu.
A person who doesn’t do well.	Ame si mewɔa nu nyuie o.
It was a bright morning.	Enye ŋdi si me kɔ nyuie.
But I am being realistic	Gake mele nu ŋutɔŋutɔ wɔm
I wasn’t the one with the gun.	Menye nyee nye amesi nɔ tu la ŋu o.
I can’t fill them	Nyemate ŋu akpe wo ɖo o
I never seemed to be able to make enough money	Edze abe nyemete ŋu kpɔ ga si sɔ gbɔ gbeɖe o ene
It’s not surprising either.	Mewɔ nuku o hã.
Everyone was starting from the same place.	Amesiame nɔ egɔme dzem tso teƒe ɖeka.
But it never felt right.	Gake mese le eɖokui me be esia sɔ kpɔ o.
I should be able to find it this afternoon	Ele be mate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu ŋdɔ sia
For my own way.	Le nye ŋutɔ nye mɔ ta.
It just never came together.	Ðeko meva ƒo ƒu gbeɖe o.
But maybe not the last.	Gake ɖewohĩ menye mamlɛtɔ o.
He put them in his hand.	Etsɔ wo de eƒe asi me.
And there are only a couple of them.	Eye wo dometɔ eve aɖewo koe li.
Think about that for a moment.	Bu nu ma tututu ŋu vie.
I think of you all too	Mi katã hã susu me nam
I can’t say enough about them	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya si sɔ tso wo ŋu o
I settled into the room	Meva nɔ xɔa me
I don’t want to do it.	Nyemedi be mawɔe o.
He has a voice.	Gbe aɖe le esi.
I think maybe someone new	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ame yeye aɖee
I can’t say that.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma o.
I hoped he would tell me the truth	Mekpɔ mɔ be agblɔ nyateƒea nam
Expect more tonight	Kpɔ mɔ na nu geɖe wu le zã sia me
You don’t really know what to say.	Mènya nya si nàgblɔ tututu o.
Water is a thing.	Tsi nye nu.
He was also pleased.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ hã.
I am a person.	Ame aɖee menye.
This is for two reasons.	Esia le susu eve ta.
It won’t bother them.	Maɖe fu na wo o.
He has my hair.	Nye ɖa le esi.
I still want to know more.	Medi kokoko be manya nu geɖe wu.
It couldn’t be simpler.	Mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe wu ema o.
I am the happiest man alive	Nyee nye ŋutsu si kpɔa dzidzɔ wu le agbe
Or maybe it didn’t.	Alo ɖewohĩ mewɔe nenema o.
It will definitely work.	Awɔ dɔ godoo ŋutɔ.
It worked for them.	Ewɔ dɔ na wo.
I just can’t allow that	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ nenema o
That is not a good news.	Menye nya nyuie wònye o.
I thought you might be asking about it	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ èle nya biam tso eŋu
Maybe they have his last name on them.	Ðewohĩ eƒe ŋkɔ mamlɛtɔ le wo ŋu.
I want to do it this way	Medi be mawɔe alea
I promise it’s not a plan	Medo ŋugbe be menye ɖoɖo aɖee o
I can’t predict what’s going to happen	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi ava dzɔ la ɖi o
That’s a whole different story.	Ema nye nya la to vovo kura.
There has to be something else.	Ele be nu bubu aɖe hã nanɔ anyi.
I think the truth is simple	Mesusu be nyateƒea le bɔbɔe
He will go himself.	Eya ŋutɔ ayi.
What about the wind.	Ke ya ɖe.
I was surprised to see you	Ewɔ nuku nam be mekpɔ wò
Also, I could have had a conversation with him.	Azɔ hã, mate ŋu aɖo dze kplii hafi.
A better school, maybe.	Suku si nyo wu, ɖewohĩ.
What will they do?.	Nukae woawɔ?.
That’s one thing.	Ema nye nya ɖeka.
I didn’t mean to bother you so much	Menye ɖe meɖoe be maɖe fu na wò alea gbegbe o
That didn’t matter.	Ema menɔ vevie o.
Part of him felt guilty	Eƒe akpa aɖe bu fɔ eɖokui
Find what works best for you.	Di nusi awɔ dɔ na wò nyuie wu.
And so did everyone else.	Eye ame sia ame hã wɔe nenema.
I just hope we can repay you in some way	Ðeko mele mɔ kpɔm be míate ŋu aɖo eteƒe na wò le mɔ aɖe nu
In a hole in the ground.	Le do aɖe me.
We can’t meet there.	Míate ŋu ado go le afima o.
I really have no idea what that means	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi ema fia o
No one really did that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He didn't seem to react at all.	Edze abe mewɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu kura o ene.
This went on for at least a year.	Esia yi edzi ƒe ɖeka ya teti.
I wasn’t surprised when no one objected	Mewɔ nuku nam esi ame aɖeke metsi tre ɖe eŋu o
I just needed something	Ðeko mehiã nane
If that.	Ne ema.
I let you out of my mind	Meɖe asi le ŋuwò le nye susu me
I will allow things to be normal	Maɖe mɔ na nuwo be woawɔ nusi sɔ
This is a huge loss for me.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe si bu nam.
Not much of anything.	Menye nu geɖe o.
I would appreciate it if you could help me.	Adzɔ dzi nam ne àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
People are that kind.	Amewo nyo dɔme nenema.
That is very important.	Ema le vevie ŋutɔ.
And he won’t do it now.	Eye mawɔe fifia o.
I'll just be there from now on	Ðeko manɔ afima tso fifia dzi
But it didn’t last long.	Gake menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
Otherwise, he would be somewhere else.	Ne menye nenema o la, anye ne anɔ teƒe bubu.
I still can’t believe he did that	Nyemeka ɖe edzi kokoko be ewɔ nu ma o
You can’t make a little more money.	Màte ŋu akpɔ ga geɖe wu vie o.
I tried to talk to him.	Medze agbagba be maƒo nu kplii.
I couldn’t let him any closer	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ wòate ɖe ŋunye wu o
Thanks a lot folks!!!.	Akpe geɖe na amewo!!!.
Everything had been a lie.	Nusianu nye alakpa tsã.
I can communicate with them, sort of	Mate ŋu aɖo dze kple wo, ƒomevi aɖe
Me, he didn’t want me to	Nye, medi be mewɔe nenema o
It is a characteristic.	Enye nɔnɔme aɖe.
And it would be a big mistake.	Eye anye vodada gã aɖe.
This sounds like something that’s bothering you.	Esia ɖi nusi le fu ɖem na wò.
I don’t want any part of it	Nyemedi eƒe akpa aɖeke o
They have four children	Vi ene le wo si
Plenty of guys out there can do it.	Ŋutsu geɖe le afima ate ŋu awɔe.
No one came home.	Ame aɖeke meva aƒeme o.
I couldn’t protect myself otherwise	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye ta ne menye nenema o
I just realized something	Ðeko mekpɔ nane dze sii
I am doing well.	Mele edzi dzem nyuie.
That would be better.	Emae anyo wu.
A new way of life	Mɔ yeye si le agbe
A month later.	Ɣleti ɖeka megbe.
It is very very small.	Ele sue ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
Or something.	Alo nane.
No one had much money.	Ga boo aɖeke menɔ ame aɖeke si o.
I was still missing something	Nane gakpɔtɔ nɔ to yim nam
It’s not because of the money.	Menye ga la tae o.
I know everyone is different	Menya be amesiame to vovo
We look forward to working with you on this.	Míele mɔ kpɔm vevie be míawɔ dɔ kpli mi le nya sia ŋu.
I’ve never seen you before.	Nyemekpɔ wò kpɔ o.
In fact, I work all the time	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔa dɔ ɣesiaɣi
I will be honest	Magblɔ nyateƒe
And that we can’t do it.	Eye be míate ŋu awɔe o.
It was definitely a challenge for me	Enye kuxi nam godoo
I kind of liked this one.	Esia ƒe nu lé dzi nam le mɔ aɖe nu.
To my surprise, he seemed to be alone	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ be edze abe eya ɖeka koe li ene
That much would be real and true.	Nu ma gbegbe anye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ kple nyateƒe.
I don’t know what he’s going to do	Nyemenya nu si wòawɔ o
I felt at home very quickly	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mele aƒeme kaba ŋutɔ
This idea will not work.	Susu sia mawɔ dɔ o.
I have never felt more alive	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be mele agbe wu nenema o
That was easy.	Ema nɔ bɔbɔe.
With my help.	To nye kpekpeɖeŋu me.
I really need to go home	Ele be mayi aƒeme ŋutɔŋutɔ
This is a real thing.	Esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The process can take months.	Dɔa wɔwɔ ate ŋu axɔ ɣleti geɖe.
I am looking forward to it	Mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie
I took them all to the hole	Metsɔ wo katã yi doa me
I want to know everything about it	Medi be manya nusianu tso eŋu
Good night to your month.	Zã nyui na wò ɣleti.
I knew what was coming.	Menya nusi gbɔna.
I can’t see how we can help with that	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi míate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu le ema me o
I can definitely understand	Mate ŋu ase egɔme godoo
It just can’t be true	Ðeko mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o
I did it for this very moment	Mewɔe na ɣeyiɣi sia tututu
So was I, for that matter	Nye hã menɔ nenema, le nya ma ta
I really don’t want to know	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be manya o
I heard the whole thing	Mese nya bliboa
But there has to be a way.	Gake ele be mɔ aɖe nanɔ anyi.
I'd be surprised if he didn't.	Awɔ nuku nam ne mewɔe nenema o.
I don’t know what happened.	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ o.
I haven’t heard from him in almost two years	Ƒe eve kloe enye sia si nyemese nya aɖeke tso eŋu o
That might be a little better than a point.	Ema ate ŋu anyo wu nya aɖe vie.
I really like her for a teacher.	Eƒe nu dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ na nufiala aɖe.
This process can be time consuming.	Dɔ sia wɔwɔ ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
I can’t help myself much either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu boo o
My current situation is a bit like my last post.	Nye nɔnɔme si me mele fifia la le abe nye nya mamlɛtɔ ene vie.
You are either here at the right time or you are not.	Èle afisia le ɣeyiɣi si sɔ me alo mèle afisia o.
I know the truth in every way	Menya nyateƒea le go sia go me
Many people don’t do this.	Ame geɖe mewɔa esia o.
There is nothing for either of us.	Naneke meli na mía dometɔ aɖeke o.
It may not work for you.	Ðewohĩ mawɔ dɔ na wò o.
I really wanted to do this	Medi vevie be mawɔ esia
It needs its own time and space.	Ehiã eya ŋutɔ ƒe ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe.
I worked for you to do.	Mewɔ dɔ na wò be nàwɔ.
There was something about it that he didn’t like.	Nane nɔ eme si medze eŋu o.
I don’t want to fight	Nyemedi be mawɔ avu o
This will be a project for next year.	Esia anye dɔ si woawɔ le ƒe si gbɔna me.
There is only one thing about it.	Nu ɖeka koe ku ɖe eŋu.
There is a tendency in these books.	Nɔnɔme aɖe le agbalẽ siawo me.
Few people did that.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔe nenema.
I finally did it	Meva wɔe mlɔeba
Also, this book.	Azɔ hã, agbalẽ sia.
Just two words.	Nya eve koe.
I understand that.	Mese nya ma gɔme.
He seemed to be waiting for something.	Edze abe ɖe wònɔ nane lalam ene.
I can’t believe this	Nyemate ŋu axɔ esia dzi ase o
The kind of thing that makes sense.	Nusi ƒomevi me susu le.
But it had been something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖee wònye tsã.
We can get rid of the whole thing.	Míate ŋu aɖe nu bliboa ɖa.
Check.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu.
I feel committed to you	Mese le ɖokuinye me be metsɔ ɖokuinye na wò
It was a very interesting point.	Enye nya aɖe si do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
I felt my face heat up	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye mo xɔ dzo
I hope you can stay here	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu anɔ afisia
It just doesn’t do that.	Ðeko mewɔa esia o.
Nothing more or less.	Nu geɖe alo sue aɖeke mele eme o.
I will let them go	Maɖe asi le wo ŋu
You can stay.	Àte ŋu anɔ anyi.
We can actually be in good shape.	Míate ŋu anɔ nɔnɔme nyui me ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I decided to join them there	Meɖoe be mawɔ ɖeka kpli wo le afima
And look at that.	Eye kpɔ ema ɖa.
I really enjoyed the work.	Dɔa dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I have never wanted anyone more	Nyemedi ame aɖe wu ema kpɔ o
Looking forward to seeing you there!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be makpɔ wò le afima!.
I can only let myself go.	Ðeko mate ŋu aɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu.
The process usually takes some time.	Zi geɖe la, dɔa wɔwɔ xɔa ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
And this too could not be satisfactory.	Eye esia hã mete ŋu dze ame ŋu o.
There was no one inside.	Ame aɖeke menɔ eme o.
I know everything now.	Menya nusianu fifia.
I know what happened	Menya nusi dzɔ
I gave them a name.	Metsɔ ŋkɔ aɖe na wo.
I didn’t expect this	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na esia o
That’s the opposite of truth.	Ema to vovo na nyateƒe.
And it’s actually something close to outrageous.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, enye nusi te ɖe dziku ŋu.
I was in control of everything	Meva nɔ nusianu dzi ɖum
I can’t remember ever being happier	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi be mekpɔ dzidzɔ wu esia kpɔ o
Someone else stood there.	Ame bubu aɖe hã tsi tre ɖe afima.
But you can just try.	Gake àte ŋu ate kpɔ ko.
I have heard all about it	Mese nu tso eŋu katã
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Thanks, have a nice day.	Akpe, ŋkeke nyui na wò.
It’s not too much, or too little.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ akpa, alo nu sue aɖe koe wònye o.
I don’t know what happened.	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ o.
From here on out.	Tso afisia.
But we can do it.	Gake míate ŋui.
A total waste of time	Ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ kura
It seems more of the same to me.	Edze nam abe nu ma ke geɖe wu ene.
I can't promise that.	Mate ŋu ado ŋugbe be mawɔe nenema o.
Trust me, you know.	Ka ɖe dzinye.
Want this, have this, want this.	Di esia, esia nanɔ asiwò, di be esia nanɔ asiwò.
It’s too outdated.	Enye nusi do xoxo akpa.
In any case.	Le nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe me.
A really deep desire	Didi si de to ŋutɔŋutɔ
It’s my little project	Enye nye dɔ sue aɖe
It’s not a big deal for them.	Menye nya gã aɖeke na wo o.
But it will be that way.	Gake anɔ nenema.
The king disappeared.	Fia la bu.
But, that doesn’t matter.	Gake, ema mehiã o.
I have to do what’s best for me, you know	Ele be mawɔ nusi anyo nam wu, ènya
I felt nervous.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be metsi dzodzodzoe.
A lot of things went wrong.	Nu geɖe gblẽ.
I do my part.	Mewɔa nye akpa dzi.
I have my own reasons for that	Nye ŋutɔ nye susu siwo tae wòle nenema ɖo la le asinye
Come on, child.	Va ɖevi.
I had been waiting.	Menɔ lalam kpɔ.
If anyone can find a good one.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpɔ nyui aɖe.
I can’t live without her	Nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi eya manɔmee o
There was something between us.	Nane nɔ mía dome.
He wasn’t there.	Menɔ afima o.
Fall.	Dze anyi.
I don’t know what got into it	Nyemenya nusi ge ɖe eme o
No one ever seemed to care.	Edze abe ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme kpɔ o ene.
That might have been true.	Ðewohĩ nya ma nye nyateƒe hafi.
A strategy that often works	Aɖaŋu aɖe si wɔa dɔ zi geɖe
He just couldn’t stand it.	Ðeko mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
I made them all for you	Mewɔ wo katã na wò
I will surprise him	Mawɔ nuku nɛ
I didn’t recognize you	Nyemekpɔ wò dze sii o
And you’re part of that.	Eye wò hã ènye ema ƒe akpa aɖe.
I thought everything might be fine	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ nusianu anyo
That's just one of them.	Ðeko ɖeka koe nye ema.
I can’t deal with that right now	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ fifia o
I know what they’re going to do about it	Menya nusi woawɔ ɖe eŋu
I need to go a little deeper.	Ele be mayi ɖe eme vie.
I wonder if we can do it	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe míate ŋu awɔe hã
House in excellent condition.	Aƒe si le nɔnɔme nyui me.
I'm still working on it.	Megale dɔ wɔm tso eŋu kokoko.
Why are we not surprised?.	Nukatae mewɔa nuku na mí o?.
They’re just so simple.	Ðeko wole bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I ask them questions.	Mebiaa nya wo.
I'll see what we can do about that.	Makpɔ nusi míate ŋu awɔ tso ema ŋu.
It is a difficult problem.	Enye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
Now I can talk to you about everything.	Fifia mate ŋu aƒo nu tso nusianu ŋu na wò.
I understand what you are looking for	Mese nu si dim nèle la gɔme
None of them had ever heard of him.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mese eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
However its very difficult.	Ke hã eƒe sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I have very similar problems.	Kuxi siwo sɔ kple esia ŋutɔ le ŋunye.
Yet it is possible to do this.	Ke hã anya wɔ be woawɔ esia.
That worked just as well.	Ema wɔ dɔ nyuie nenema ke.
Tell us about it.	Ƒo nu na mí.
I want to meet this guy	Medi be mado go ŋutsu sia
I’m fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam.
I asked what was going on	Mebia nukae nɔ edzi yim hã
Your very own heart can do that.	Wò ŋutɔ wò dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ ate ŋu awɔ ema.
I will find my way.	Madi nye mɔ.
He was fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
And of course it didn’t.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
This, right here.	Esia, le afisia tututu.
I want to do it all on my own	Medi be mawɔ wo katã le ɖokuinye si
But, it surprised me.	Gake, ewɔ nuku nam.
I had no problem with that	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ ŋunye le ema ŋu o
He will believe anything.	Axɔ nusianu dzi ase.
But it didn’t happen that way.	Gake meva eme nenema o.
But maybe it’s because it’s not summer yet.	Gake ɖewohĩ esi dzomeŋɔli meɖo haɖe o tae.
I have tried many ways to do this.	Mete mɔ geɖe kpɔ be mawɔ esia.
And let me just do it this way.	Eye mina mawɔe alea ko.
Use the whole path.	Zã mɔ bliboa.
I had to find out who was really behind this	Ele be madi amesi tututu nɔ megbe na esia
That’s the first part.	Emae nye akpa gbãtɔ.
I was anxious to see you	Metsi dzi be makpɔ wò
It’s not really true.	Menye nyateƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Everyone laughed at him.	Amesiame ko nu nɛ.
No one explained this to me.	Ame aɖeke meɖe nya sia me nam o.
We need to do more.	Ele be míawɔ geɖe wu.
Do whatever you have to do.	Wɔ nusianu si wòle be nàwɔ.
You have to tell me the truth.	Ele be nàgblɔ nyateƒea nam.
It’s much easier than that.	Ele bɔbɔe wu nenema.
A lot of people just haven’t heard of it	Ðeko ame geɖe mese eŋu nya kpɔ o
He didn't want to go last night.	Medi be yeayi le zã si va yi me o.
It has never been easy for me.	Menɔ bɔbɔe nam kpɔ o.
I knew they had been talking about me.	Menya be wole nu ƒom tso ŋunye kpɔ.
I will deal with myself	Mawɔ nu le ɖokuinye ŋu
I think that’s the root of everything	Mesusu be emae nye nusianu ƒe ke
This time, it will do everything right.	Fifia ya, awɔ nusianu nyuie.
I missed them a lot.	Wo to ŋunye ŋutɔ.
There must be more.	Ele be nu geɖe wu nanɔ anyi.
I shouldn’t have gotten involved myself	Mele be nye ŋutɔ maƒo ɖokuinye ɖe eme hafi o
I told him he didn’t have to do that	Megblɔ nɛ be mehiã be wòawɔ nu ma o
I recognized myself, but not quite me	Mekpɔ ɖokuinye dze sii, gake menye nyee tututu o
No one knows his real name.	Ame aɖeke menya eƒe ŋkɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I decided to save myself.	Meɖoe be maɖe ɖokuinye.
We don’t have any time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke mele mía si o.
There were so many reasons.	Susu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi siwo tae.
I need to talk to you about something	Ehiã be maƒo nu tso nane ŋu kpli wò

Change your mind.	Trɔ wò susu.
He did the right thing.	Ewɔ nu si sɔ.
But that time never came.	Gake ɣeyiɣi ma meva kpɔ o.
I found him a nice home	Mekpɔ aƒe nyui aɖe nɛ
Life will go on for them.	Agbe ayi edzi na wo.
I doubt anyone would suggest this	Meke ɖi be ame aɖe ado susu sia ɖa
This is just part of it.	Esia nye eƒe akpa aɖe ko.
Which they probably had.	Nusi ɖewohĩ nɔ wo si.
I needed to talk to someone about it.	Ehiã be maƒo nu tso eŋu kple ame aɖe.
It might still be of some use to us.	Ðewohĩ aɖe vi na mí vie kokoko.
None of them seemed to grow up.	Edze abe wo dometɔ aɖeke metsi o ene.
The dog was there.	Avu la nɔ afima.

We don’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele mía si o.

I was shocked, yet not surprised that he did that	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ, ke hã mewɔ nuku nam be ewɔ nu ma o
They’ve been here since episode one.	Wole afisia tso akpa gbãtɔ dzi.

It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I am sure of that	Meka ɖe edzi le ema ŋu
Everything got wet.	Nusianu xɔ tsi.
But I didn’t feel anything	Gake nyemese naneke le ɖokuinye me o
And it’s working now.	Eye wòle dɔ wɔm fifia.
I couldn’t understand what had happened	Nyemete ŋu se nusi dzɔ la gɔme o
I can’t tell you anything	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke na wò o
It’s what you do with it that matters.	Nusi nàwɔ kplii ye le vevie.
He didn’t face any issues.	Medze ŋgɔ nya aɖeke o.
I had another reason, of course	Susu bubu aɖe hã nɔ asinye ya
I tried several times to talk to him but couldn’t	Medze agbagba zi geɖe be maƒo nu kplii gake nyemete ŋui o
I do not know.	Nye menya o.
I think maybe he got sick once too.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ eya hã dze dɔ zi ɖeka.
He was fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
People were talking.	Amewo nɔ nu ƒom.
Perhaps you have a question.	Ðewohĩ nya aɖe le asiwò.
I want to continue to own my home	Medi be mayi edzi anye nye aƒe tɔ
From time to time.	Tso ɣeyiɣi yi ɣeyiɣi.

I told you so this morning	Megblɔ na mi nenema ŋdi sia
Who he was defined what he was doing.	Ame si wònye la ɖe nusi wɔm wònɔ la gɔme.
I had to be like everyone else	Ele be manɔ abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene
However, he never saw anything.	Ke hã, mekpɔ naneke kpɔ o.
I just wanted to get out of there	Ðeko medi be mado le afima
I might have been apologizing	Ðewohĩ menɔ kuku ɖem hafi
Things are different now.	Nuwo to vovo fifia.
I really liked everything	Nusianu dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
Be grateful for what you have.	Da akpe ɖe nu siwo le asiwò ta.
I remember so many things	Meɖo ŋku nu geɖe ŋutɔ dzi
It was something that brought people together.	Enye nane si ƒo amewo nu ƒu ɖekae.
Anything, anything, good is possible now.	Nusianu, nusianu, nyui ate ŋu adzɔ fifia.
More about me here.	Nya geɖe tso ŋunye le afisia.
I want to make a good one here	Medi be mawɔ ɖeka nyui aɖe le afisia
Everything is over.	Nusianu wu enu.
It just wasn’t working for me.	Ðeko menɔ dɔ wɔm nam o.
I don’t know what hit me.	Nyemenya nusi ƒo ɖe dzinye o.
A name was very important	Ŋkɔ aɖe nɔ vevie ŋutɔ
I couldn’t have gotten there any sooner	Nyemate ŋu aɖo afima kaba wu ema o
I was doing this.	Menɔ esia wɔm.
In this case, there is no condition.	Le go sia me la, nɔnɔme aɖeke meli o.
I was doing too much.	Menɔ nu geɖe wɔm akpa.
He didn’t do any good.	Mewɔ nyui aɖeke o.
I knew there was a problem there, again	Menya be kuxi aɖe le afima, ake
I can’t remember exactly	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi tututu o
It’s already.	Enye xoxo.
But I didn’t have it either	Gake nye hã menɔ asinye o
I don’t have time.	Ɣeyiɣi mele asinye o.
He seemed to be talking to himself.	Edze abe ɖe wònɔ nu ƒom na eɖokui ene.
I didn’t like this at all	Esia medze ŋunye kura o
A good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖe.
I am convinced of it now.	Meka ɖe edzi fifia.
And she can’t have a man.	Eye mate ŋu akpɔ ŋutsu aɖeke o.
I could have killed you all that night	Anye ne mate ŋu awu wò le zã ma katã me hafi
There has to be more to it than that.	Ele be nu geɖe nanɔ eme wu ema.
I don’t want to meet one.	Nyemedi be mado go ɖeka o.
But this year.	Gake le ƒe sia me.
Everyone knows who he is.	Amesiame nya amesi wònye.
It seems to have worked both well and good.	Edze abe ewɔ dɔ nyuie kple nu nyui siaa ene.
Come see me in a week or so.	Va kpɔm le kwasiɖa ɖeka alo esi wu nenema megbe.
I don’t think it is though.	Nyemesusu be ele nenema o ke hã.
I don’t know how to do that	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ awɔ emae o
But the opposite is true.	Gake nusi to vovo na emae nye nyateƒe.
What happened to that?.	Nukae dzɔ ɖe ema dzi?.
I'll come and get you.	Mava xɔ wò.
He couldn’t do it.	Mete ŋu wɔe o.
From this morning on.	Tso ŋdi sia dzi la.
That’s just the way it is here.	Nenema koe wòle le afisia.
Less is always more.	Nu sue aɖe koe nye nu geɖe ɣesiaɣi.
I almost felt honored	Mese le ɖokuinye me kloe be bubu le ŋunye
Not in the background.	Menye le megbe o.
I don’t know exactly what it is	Nyemenya nusi tututu wònye o
Your good character.	Wò nɔnɔme nyui.
I needed to stay together	Ehiã be manɔ anyi ɖekae
And he was very clear about this	Eye eme kɔ ŋutɔ le esia ŋu
I can’t take anything	Nyemate ŋu axɔ naneke o
It was just there.	Afima koe wònɔ.
You have to be focused.	Ele be wò susu nanɔ nu ŋu.
And that we lost a lot.	Eye be nu geɖe bu na mí.
I needed money, a job and a new place to live	Mehiã ga, dɔ kple teƒe yeye si manɔ
That’s why it doesn’t work.	Esia tae mewɔa dɔ o ɖo.
I know we are asking a lot	Menya be míele nu geɖe biam
I couldn’t get out of the house.	Nyemete ŋu do le aƒea me o.
It worked out well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
I think they had some questions	Mesusu be nya aɖewo nɔ wo biam
I know you are very busy.	Menya be vovo mele ŋuwò kura o.
It’s not that difficult.	Menye nu sesẽ nenema gbegbe o.
That’s just me.	Nye koe nye ema.
Reason could not satisfy me.	Susu mete ŋu na nye dzi dze eme o.
I have never felt this way before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me alea kpɔ o
Still, he enjoyed it.	Ke hã, edzɔ dzi nɛ.
Not so fast enough.	Menye kaba nenema gbegbe o.
There was nothing for it but to fight on.	Naneke menɔ anyi na esia wu be woawɔ avu ɖe edzi o.
I tried to stay in shape	Medze agbagba be manɔ nɔnɔme nyui me
I have several other rooms here	Xɔ bubu geɖe le asinye le afisia
There is a fire in them.	Dzo le wo me.
Something very strange, that.	Nane si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ, be.
I had to do something.	Ele be mawɔ nane.
Any ideas or plans?.	Susu alo ɖoɖo aɖewo li?.
I would have thought he would have done something else	Anye ne mesusu be awɔ nu bubu aɖe hafi
There’s something about her face, her face.	Nane le eƒe mo, eƒe mo.
I hope you enjoy it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò
You can’t get too close.	Màte ŋu ate ɖe eŋu akpa o.
I didn’t notice anything	Nyemekpɔ naneke dze sii o
And that could be good news for us.	Eye ema ate ŋu anye nya nyui na mí.
He did this, he did too.	Ewɔ esia, eya hã wɔe.
There is enough money.	Ga ŋu sɔ gbɔ.

Every life matters.	Agbe ɖesiaɖe le vevie.
Go ahead, try one.	Yi edzi, te ɖeka kpɔ.
There was something about it.	Nu aɖe nɔ eŋu.
Everyone in it was one of them.	Amesiame si nɔ eme la nye wo dometɔ ɖeka.

I tried to do it.	Medze agbagba be mawɔe.
I'm sure no one will bother anyone in this town	Meka ɖe edzi be ame aɖeke maɖe fu na ame aɖeke le du sia me o
A really interesting point	Nya si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ
Let me continue.	Mina mayi edzi.
Just like in life.	Abe alesi wòle le agbe me ene.
There are many opportunities	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe li
He didn’t prove anything.	Meɖo kpe naneke dzi o.
The reality seems to be quite the opposite.	Edze abe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si le eme la to vovo kura na ema ene.
But he can do it.	Gake ate ŋu awɔe.
I was always more worried about you	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò wu ɣesiaɣi
This guy came.	Ŋutsu sia va.
I was able to talk them through another week	Mete ŋu ƒo nu na wo vaseɖe kwasiɖa bubu me
I used to be like you, kid	Menɔ abe wò ene tsã, ɖevi

I thought it was impossible.	Mesusu be manya wɔ o.

Everyone is great.	Amesiame nye gã.

I had someone for my book in progress	Ame aɖe nɔ asinye na nye agbalẽ si nɔ edzi yim la
This is a difficult problem.	Esia nye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.

He’s got it and or.	Eƒe asi le eŋu eye alo.
I don’t know what to do	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o
That whole thing works.	Nu ma katã wɔa dɔ.
That’s why he was fucking here.	Esia tae wònɔ fu ɖem le afisia ɖo.
I wasn’t doing any of this stuff	Menye nyee nɔ nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke wɔm o
He didn’t let go of his face.	Meɖe asi le eƒe mo ŋu o.
I don’t know what to say about that	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ tso nya ma ŋu o
That was important to him.	Ema nɔ vevie nɛ.
I just need to talk to you	Ðeko wòle be maƒo nu kpli wò
I felt sick, afterwards	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye lãme gblẽ, le ema megbe
I want to expose every one of them	Medi be maɖe wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ɖe go
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I have to keep running	Ele be mayi edzi anɔ du dzi
There is nothing he can do, of course.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ o ya.
You know it’s nothing.	Ènya be menye naneke o.
I wondered if that was fair	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe ema sɔ hã
It still made no sense.	Susu aɖeke menɔ eme kokoko o.
I needed a replacement	Mehiã ame aɖe si axɔ ɖe eteƒe
This whole thing is amazing.	Nu sia katã wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This would be amazing.	Esia awɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I almost fell in love with him in that moment	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam kloe le ɣeyiɣi ma me
Please, sit down.	Taflatse, nɔ anyi.
I'm just going to miss you	Ðeko mele wò susu ge
Maybe it will help.	Ðewohĩ akpe ɖe ame ŋu.
A dog will eat itself to death	Avu aɖu eɖokui vaseɖe ku me
I’m glad you liked it.	Edzɔ dzi nam be edzɔ dzi na wò.
I felt terrible for him	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ɖe eŋu
I can’t live in the past.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe le ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me o.
I can’t see how he could have known	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi wòate ŋu anya o
I'll talk to him myself in time.	Nye ŋutɔ maƒo nu kplii le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe.

It’s a part of it.	Eƒe akpa aɖe.
And they’ve become easier to find in recent years.	Eye wo didi le bɔbɔe wu le ƒe ʋɛ siwo va yi me.
I want more in life	Medi be makpɔ nu geɖe wu le agbe me
Write the truth.	Ŋlɔ nyateƒea.
It can be very surprising.	Ate ŋu awɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I came to move.	Meva ʋu.
There is no room for all of us.	Teƒe aɖeke meli na mí katã o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I was there, but not for the reason you think	Menɔ afima, gake menye le susu si nèsusu ta o
Only you can know that.	Wò ɖeka koe ate ŋu anya nya ma.
I wondered what could have happened	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae ate ŋu adzɔ hafi hã
No one knew he was here.	Ame aɖeke menya be ele afisia o.
I can’t tell you what an honor it is	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ bubu si wònye na wò o
These.	Nu siawo.
Press.	Te ɖe anyi.
I never understood this myself	Nye ŋutɔ nyemese esia gɔme kpɔ o
This seems very strange.	Esia dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ ene.
Not at all.	Menye ɖeke o.
I don’t know what to make of that	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso ema ŋu o
One cannot eat anything that is not alive.	Ame mate ŋu aɖu naneke si me agbe mele o.
He couldn’t think of it.	Mete ŋu bu eŋu o.
I made a mistake.	Mewɔ vodada aɖe.
I know the type well	Menya ƒomevi la nyuie
I ask if I have anything else to wear	Mebiaa nenye be nu bubu aɖe li mado hã
Think too far beyond that.	Bu nusi yi ŋgɔ wu ema ŋu akpa.
I answered there	Meɖo nya ŋu le afima
I have to get this right.	Ele nam be makpɔ esia nyuie.
It is also true.	Enye nyateƒe hã.
I can’t deny it anymore	Nyemate ŋu agbe nu le eŋu azɔ o
Something else came to mind.	Nu bubu aɖe hã va susu me nam.
I asked you that.	Mebia wò be.
And yet it happened.	Eye ke hã edzɔ.
I’m sure he doesn’t trust me	Meka ɖe edzi be meka ɖe dzinye o
I kind of touched them before.	Meka asi wo ŋu do ŋgɔ le mɔ aɖe nu.
But I didn’t have time for that	Gake ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye ɖe ema ŋu o
I told him there was a fire in the room	Megblɔ nɛ be dzo le xɔa me
I took in his hard throat, his hard jaw	Mexɔ eƒe kɔ sesẽ, eƒe aɖu sesẽ la ɖe eme
But not too often.	Gake menye zi geɖe akpa o.
I felt his blood on my tongue	Mese eƒe ʋu le nye aɖe dzi
A year has passed.	Ƒe ɖeka va yi.
I knew there was something behind that room	Menya be nane le xɔ ma megbe
At this point, no one has any idea.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, susu aɖeke mele ame aɖeke si o.
I was just talking.	Ðeko menɔ nu ƒom.
I never felt that way about any man	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema ɖe ŋutsu aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o
It’s the only thing he likes about them.	Eya koe nye nu si dzɔa dzi nɛ le wo ŋu.
I have to know.	Ele be manya.
Obviously not now.	Edze ƒã be menye fifia o.
I hoped that he would.	Mekpɔ mɔ be awɔe nenema.
You can’t do these two things at the same time.	Màte ŋu awɔ nu eve siawo le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me o.
I can’t take another step.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe afɔ bubu o.
Ask us how he got into it.	Bia mí be aleke wòwɔ ge ɖe eme hã.
That’s too much.	Ema sɔ gbɔ akpa.
He didn’t bring any water.	Metsɔ tsi aɖeke ɖe asi o.
And never more so than now.	Eye menye nenema gbegbe wu fifia gbeɖe o.
Something will happen.	Nane adzɔ.
Which is not a bad thing.	Nusi menye nu gbegblẽ o.
And for nothing else.	Eye ɖe naneke ta o.
This shouldn’t be the case.	Mele be esia nanɔ nenema o.
I thought that was impossible	Mesusu be ema manya wɔ o
But it was a good place.	Gake teƒe nyui aɖee wònye.
I just wanted to talk to him.	Ðeko medi be maƒo nu kplii.
If someone can do it, we can do it.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu awɔe la, míate ŋu awɔe.
That doesn’t suit me too well.	Ema medze nam akpa o.
This is correct, but only up to a point.	Esia sɔ, gake vaseɖe afi aɖe ko.
I couldn’t help being angry	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe dziku nu o
Months passed by.	Ɣleti geɖe va yi.
I agreed with him.	Mewɔ ɖeka kplii.
It used to be one.	Enye ɖeka tsã.
But not now, though.	Gake menye fifia o.
In our house.	Le míaƒe aƒeme.

Not against much.	Menye ɖe nu geɖe ŋu o.
I hope it actually happens	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ
I should at least try	Ele be mate kpɔ ya teti
That’s all he has to do.	Ema koe wòle be wòawɔ.
Our work is challenging but not difficult.	Míaƒe dɔa sesẽ gake menye nu sesẽ o.
I lived only for myself.	Nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye koe menɔ agbe le.
He can always listen.	Ate ŋu aɖo to ɣesiaɣi.
I want to go there	Medi be mayi afima
And this will continue to be the case	Eye esia ayi edzi anɔ alea
I don’t think it worked that way	Mesusu be mewɔ dɔ nenema o
I did like him, a lot	Mewɔe abe eya ene, geɖe ŋutɔ
I can’t see anyone in front of us or behind us	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ame aɖeke le mía ŋgɔ alo le mía megbe o
I'm sure of it	Meka ɖe edzi
I think it might be useful in the coming months	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ aɖe vi le ɣleti siwo gbɔna me
I figured out the whole thing today	Mekpɔ nu bliboa gbɔ egbea
He didn’t see anything.	Mekpɔ naneke o.
I quickly got out of his way	Mewɔ kaba do le eƒe mɔ dzi
That says a lot about my state of mind.	Ema gblɔ nu geɖe tso nye susu ƒe nɔnɔme ŋu.
I can’t do this on my own	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia le ɖokuinye si o
But our last fight doesn’t matter, anymore.	Gake míaƒe avu mamlɛtɔ mele vevie o, megale vevie o.
I got closer to get a better look	Mete ɖe eŋu wu be makpɔ nu nyuie wu
I didn’t want to talk to them about anything	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso naneke ŋu na wo o
I miss you so much.	Mesusu wò ŋutɔ.
I can’t remember who it was	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku amesi wònye dzi o
People seem to be missing the point on this.	Edze abe amewo le nya la tom le nya sia ŋu ene.
I have something to tell you.	Nya aɖe le asinye magblɔ na mi.
There are two rooms in the building.	Xɔ eve le xɔa me.
He didn’t know much.	Menya nu geɖe o.
There were many results from this.	Nu geɖe do tso esia me.
I don’t know about this	Nyemenya nu tso esia ŋu o
I fell for him very hard	Medze anyi ɖe eŋu sesĩe ŋutɔ
He won’t find anything.	Makpɔ naneke o.
There is still something here.	Nane gakpɔtɔ le afisia.
This works better.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie wu.
I had heard of them.	Mese wo ŋkɔ kpɔ.
Or we have too much salt.	Alo dze sɔ gbɔ ɖe mía si.
He was the only one he could have.	Eya koe nye ame si ate ŋu anɔ esi.
I’m not feeling well.	Nyemele nyuie o.
I was so close to him	Mete ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe
Something that is very important.	Nane si le vevie ŋutɔ.
He can just go home.	Ðeko wòate ŋu ayi aƒeme.
Discover a few things.	Ke ɖe nu ʋɛ aɖewo ŋu.
Please any help.	Taflatse kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe.
I can’t say a word in myself.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖe le ɖokuinye me o.

A job comes up.	Dɔ aɖe va doa mo ɖa.

Consider what is available.	Bu nusi li.
I want to live here too	Medi be manɔ afisia hã
I can’t do that, though	Nyemate ŋu awɔe nenema o, ke hã
The car moved away.	Ʋua ʋu dzo.
I happen to be one of them	Edzɔ be menye wo dometɔ ɖeka
He didn’t trust many people.	Meka ɖe ame geɖe dzi o.
I'm sure there must be something like that	Meka ɖe edzi be ele be nane si le abe ema ene nanɔ anyi

That doesn’t really matter.	Ema mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
And the next season is right around the corner.	Eye ɣeyiɣi si gbɔna la tu aƒe tututu.
I couldn’t understand his death	Nyemete ŋu se eƒe ku gɔme o
But that’s on the sidelines.	Gake ema le akpa dzi.
I can say that it happened	Mate ŋu agblɔ be edzɔ nenema
But something that works.	Gake nane si wɔa dɔ.
I was very angry	Medo dziku ŋutɔ
I want to know everything about it	Medi be manya nusianu tso eŋu
I know this is hard for him	Menya be esia sesẽ nɛ

It only lasted a few weeks	Kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo koe wònɔ anyi
I can’t find them anywhere	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wo le afi aɖeke o
There was food there.	Nuɖuɖu nɔ afima.
I wonder what he will do about it.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae wòawɔ tso eŋu hã.
It has doubled.	Edzi ɖe edzi zi gbɔ zi eve.
The issue stands still.	Nya la tsi tre ɖe teƒe ɖeka.
I can’t be in two places at once.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ teƒe eve zi ɖeka o.
But I had to go	Gake ele nam be mayi

You have the right guy.	Ŋutsu si sɔ la le asiwò.
And he has a good voice.	Eye gbe nyui aɖe le esi.
I haven’t felt this way in a long time	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia nyemese le ɖokuinye me alea o
This works well in many cases.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie le go geɖe me.
There is no problem now.	Kuxi aɖeke meli fifia o.
Every hour will be made out of them.	Woawɔ gaƒoƒo ɖesiaɖe tso wo me.
But he didn’t think it would happen here.	Gake mesusu be adzɔ le afisia o.
Nothing that important, you know.	Naneke mele vevie nenema gbegbe o, ènya.
I missed that a lot	Ema to ŋunye ŋutɔ
If he is alive.	Ne ele agbe.
They all have one thing in common.	Nu ɖeka aɖe le wo katã si.
I just threw my whole life away to save you	Ðeko metsɔ nye agbe bliboa ƒu gbe be maɖe wò
But that will take time.	Gake ema axɔ ɣeyiɣi.
I couldn’t bear to be here	Nyemete ŋu do dzi be manɔ afisia o
I decided to make a plan	Meɖoe be mawɔ ɖoɖo aɖe
I can summarize here.	Mate ŋu agblɔ kpuie le afisia.
I said you can’t tell that to the police	Megblɔ be màte ŋu agblɔ nya ma na kpovitɔwo o
I wanted something better.	Medi nane si nyo wu.

It didn’t stand up well at all.	Metsi tre nyuie kura o.
If only it could have happened.	Ne ɖe wòate ŋu adzɔ hafi.
But he couldn’t see that.	Gake mete ŋu kpɔ ema o.
Quite the opposite in fact.	Nusi to vovo kura na ema le nyateƒe me.
I don’t know if we can survive	Nyemenya nenye be míate ŋu anɔ agbe o
I did it that way.	Mewɔe nenema.
I was seriously ill.	Medze dɔ vevie.
I don’t know what to do about it	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso eŋu o
But there really isn’t much to it.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nu boo aɖeke mele eŋu o.

There are people who have done it and there are people who haven’t.	Ame aɖewo li siwo wɔe kpɔ eye ame aɖewo hã li siwo mewɔe o.
Now, there are two problems with this strategy.	Fifia, kuxi eve le aɖaŋu sia ŋu.
I am deeply saddened by what happened	Nusi dzɔ la te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
There is something for everyone.	Nane li na amesiame.
And do it with joy.	Eye wɔe kple dzidzɔ.
I decided to pray though	Meɖoe be mado gbe ɖa gake
I couldn’t get out of it	Nyemete ŋu do le eme o
Time is time.	Ɣeyiɣi nye ɣeyiɣi.
I guess being positive about it doesn’t work	Mesusu be nu nyui wɔwɔ le eŋu mewɔa dɔ o
I didn’t feel like I had anything left	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be naneke megale asinye o
Be what happened.	Nye nusi dzɔ.

I can’t help but be angry	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke wu dziku o
I gave up everything	Meɖe asi le nusianu ŋu
On the honor.	Le bubu ŋu.
You know what they are like.	Ènya alesi wole.
I could have saved them.	Mete ŋu xɔ na wo hafi.
I am not sure which one.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be kae o.
An appointment must be made.	Ele be woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ɣeyiɣi aɖe ŋu.
A place that doesn’t belong to anyone	Teƒe si menye ame aɖeke tɔ o
I couldn’t be happier for her	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ nɛ wu ema o
I assure you this is no easy task	Meka ɖe edzi na mi be esia menye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖeke o
I have to know.	Ele be manya.
It’s not surprising.	Mewɔ nuku o.
But take this to him.	Gake tsɔ esia yi nɛ.
I need more time for it	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi geɖe ɖe eŋu
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
And every room gets enough food.	Eye xɔ ɖesiaɖe xɔa nuɖuɖu siwo sɔ.
That time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi ma va yi.
He was a depressed man.	Enye ŋutsu aɖe si nu te ɖe edzi.
I couldn’t talk about it to anyone.	Nyemete ŋu ƒo nu tso eŋu na ame aɖeke o.
I don’t want to let that go.	Nyemedi be maɖe asi le nya ma ŋu o.
I could see what was going on in his mind.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nusi le edzi yim le eƒe susu me.
It was still daytime.	Ŋkeke gakpɔtɔ nye ema.
I just want to see you	Ðeko medi be makpɔ wò
This didn’t make sense.	Susu menɔ nya sia me o.
You can trust me.	Àte ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe ŋunye.
I didn’t know that before, but it made sense	Nyemenya ema tsã o, gake susu nɔ eme
But things have moved forward.	Gake nuwo yi ŋgɔ.
All we have is today.	Nusi le mía si koe nye egbea.
I am very interested in you	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò vevie
And at least some of them were still alive.	Eye wo dometɔ aɖewo ya teti gakpɔtɔ nɔ agbe.
I had my man.	Nye ŋutsu nɔ asinye.
Maybe I was paralyzed, I can’t really remember	Ðewohĩ nye lãme ku, nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o
It’s a situation no one wants.	Enye nɔnɔme si ame aɖeke medi o.
That seems clear.	Edze abe nya ma me kɔ ene.
I needed to know this place, it was important	Ehiã be manya teƒe sia, ele vevie
I really enjoyed that part of it	Eƒe akpa ma do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
However, many people don’t.	Ke hã, ame geɖe mewɔe nenema o.
And there is no time.	Eye ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli o.
I'm not really sure what else to say	Nyemeka ɖe nya bubu si magblɔ dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o
Not sure if you can make it into it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be àte ŋu awɔe ɖe eme o.
I couldn’t understand it before.	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme tsã o.
He didn’t let me go.	Meɖe asi le ŋunye o.
They wouldn’t have a chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ manɔ wo si o.
I just thought he was hot	Ðeko mesusu be eƒe lãme xɔ dzo
Everyone died.	Ame sia ame ku.
I was somewhere else	Menɔ teƒe bubu aɖe
I've done that too many times	Mewɔe nenema zi geɖe akpa
Where is it located.	Afikae wòle.
It’s just us being us.	Ðeko wònye mí be míenye mí.
My attitude has also changed.	Nye nɔnɔme hã trɔ.
What needs to be done is clear.	Nusi wòle be woawɔ la me kɔ.
That’s a problem.	Ema nye kuxi.
No one has ever attacked me either	Ame aɖeke hã medze dzinye kpɔ o
I can’t say anything more.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke wu ema o.
There has to be a mistake.	Ele be vodada aɖe nanɔ anyi.
He wasn’t sure he could do it.	Meka ɖe edzi be yeate ŋu awɔe o.
He was the only one.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
You’ll be fascinated by it.	Eƒe nu adzɔ dzi na wò.
I’m not going to say anything.	Nyemele nya aɖeke gblɔ ge o.
But a long time has passed.	Gake ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe va yi.
This is actually a simple task.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia nye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖe.
It is so important.	Ele vevie ale gbegbe.
Spend a few hours on it.	Zã gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo ɖe eŋu.
In some cases, this may be true.	Le go aɖewo me la, esia ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
I glanced around, unable to find a trail	Meɖe ŋku ɖe afima, nyemete ŋu kpɔ mɔ aɖeke o
I am going to tell you something.	Mele nya aɖe gblɔ ge na wò.
I got there this afternoon.	Meɖo afima ŋdɔ sia.
No one knows that better than he does.	Ame aɖeke menya ema nyuie wu eya o.
I think we have enough things now	Mesusu be nuwo sɔ gbɔ na mí fifia
He was not one of his own people.	Menye eya ŋutɔ ƒe amewo dometɔ ɖekae wònye o.
He didn’t take any money.	Mexɔ ga aɖeke o.
We already have enough trouble.	Kuxi si sɔ gbɔ le mía me xoxo.
I planned this day a week ago	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ŋkeke sia ŋu kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia
According to him, it’s a big deal.	Le eƒe nya nu la, enye nya gã aɖe.
Nothing surprised me.	Naneke mewɔ nuku nam o.
The reason for this is simple.	Susu si tae wòle alea ɖo la le bɔbɔe.
It didn’t surprise anyone.	Mewɔ nuku na ame aɖeke o.
That would have been one thing.	Ema anye nu ɖeka hafi.
The meeting ended shortly thereafter	Kpekpea wu enu le ema megbe kpuie
I needed to know this	Ehiã be manya esia
I think he did a pretty good job with that.	Mesusu be ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ le ema ŋu.
And he was doing a good job of it.	Eye wònɔ dɔ nyui aɖe wɔm le eŋu.
It might have mattered to me.	Ðewohĩ anɔ vevie nam hafi.
I can go now.	Mate ŋu ayi fifia.
I couldn’t have done it without you	Anye ne nyemate ŋui o ne menye wòe o
Its new and it’s bad.	Eƒe nu yeye kple eƒe nu gbegblẽ.
I can’t imagine a life	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ agbe aɖe le susu me o
This can last from one day to four months	Esia ate ŋu anɔ anyi tso ŋkeke ɖeka va ɖo ɣleti ene
Get to know them very well.	Nya wo nyuie ŋutɔ.
That’s not what they’re for.	Menye ema tae wole o.
I needed fresh air	Mehiã ya nyui aɖe
He could have walked there.	Ate ŋu azɔ ayi afima hafi.
I’ve tried it before.	Medze agbagba kpɔ.
I think that means something	Mesusu be esia fia nane
The meeting is over.	Kpekpea wu enu.
I was in such a changed state	Menɔ nɔnɔme si trɔ alea me
I could be wrong .	Mate ŋu anye vodada .
It was a rock.	Enye kpe aɖe.
I’m worried about you.	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò.
Why? 	Nu ka ta?
Maybe one a year.	Ðewohĩ ɖeka le ƒe ɖeka me.
I can always let it go	Mate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu ɣesiaɣi
I stepped into a trap	Meɖe afɔ ɖe mɔ̃ aɖe me
There is nothing in between.	Naneke mele wo dome o.
Setting things up in order.	Nuwo ɖoɖo ɖe ɖoɖo nu.
I like what he’s doing	Nusi wɔm wòle la dzɔa dzi nam
I want to work with them	Medi be mawɔ dɔ kpli wo
I just didn’t know it was	Ðeko nyemenya be ele nenema o
I can never repay you	Nyemate ŋu aɖo eteƒe na wò gbeɖe o
Under his own full name, of course.	Le eya ŋutɔ ƒe ŋkɔ bliboa te, le nyateƒe me.
Or the money could go elsewhere.	Alo ga la ate ŋu ayi teƒe bubu.
I wanted to have the mindset that I was alone	Medi be susu nanɔ asinye be nye ɖeka koe li
That's good.	Ema nyo.
I just don’t know where to go from here.	Ðeko nyemenya afi si mayi tso afisia o.
His face was amazing.	Eƒe mo wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Forget about this for now.	Ŋlɔ nya sia be fifia.
He’s missing a few teeth	Eƒe aɖu ʋɛ aɖewo bu
I have to explain something	Ele be maɖe nane me
In a household.	Le aƒe aɖe me.
He didn’t care about anything else.	Metsɔ ɖeke le nu bubu aɖeke me o.
I’ve already started	Medze egɔme xoxo
I will do that more often	Mawɔ ema zi geɖe wu
I can’t answer that for myself either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu aɖo nya ma ŋu na ɖokuinye o
There was no moon in the clear night .	Ɣleti aɖeke menɔ anyi le zã si me kɔ nyuie la me o .
I need to try this now!	Ele be mate esia kpɔ fifia!
At least once a week.	Zi ɖeka ya teti le kwasiɖa me.
I have already said too much	Megblɔ nya geɖe akpa xoxo
Its dead there.	Eƒe ku ɖe afima.
I congratulated him.	Medo dzidzɔ nɛ.
I didn’t know what to say to him	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ nɛ o
If someone makes a suggestion.	Ne ame aɖe ɖo aɖaŋu aɖe.
Time will continue.	Ɣeyiɣi ayi edzi.
I tried to fight it, but it was impossible	Medze agbagba be mawɔ avu kplii, gake manya wɔ o
Like my people.	Abe nye amewo ene.
I can finish this now	Mate ŋu awu esia nu fifia
They never had any time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ wo si kpɔ o.
A few bad months, a few good ones	Ɣleti gbegblẽ ʋɛ aɖewo, nyui ʋɛ aɖewo
I want to talk to you alone	Medi be maƒo nu kpli wò ɖeka
Nothing else really matters.	Nu bubu aɖeke mele vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Like he could still improve himself or something.	Abe alesi wòate ŋu anyo ɖe edzi na eɖokui alo nane kokoko ene.
It was as if he did not exist.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe meli o ene.
I stood looking at the market	Metsi tre nɔ asi la kpɔm
A lot happened during this time.	Nu geɖe dzɔ le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
So far, it’s obvious enough.	Vaseɖe fifia la, edze ƒã ale gbegbe.
But they had some good bones for them.	Gake ƒu nyui aɖewo nɔ wo si na wo.
He should never have joined them.	Mele be wòawɔ ɖeka kpli wo gbeɖe o hafi.
I couldn’t trust anyone	Nyemete ŋu ka ɖe ame aɖeke dzi o
I wasn’t sure what to expect.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi makpɔ mɔ na dzi o.
I can call them anytime and anything	Mate ŋu aƒo ka na wo ɣesiaɣi kple nusianu
It will need more.	Ahiã geɖe wu.
That’s one nice outfit.	Ema nye awu nyui ɖeka.
One needs money to survive.	Ame hiã ga hafi ate ŋu anɔ agbe.
I wasn’t sure what he would do	Nyemeka ɖe nusi wòawɔ dzi o
There is a quick time as well.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe li si me woawɔ kaba hã.
I knew he was testing me	Menya be ele nye dom kpɔ
He and his mouth.	Eya kple eƒe nu.
There is no intermediary.	Dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
But these issues are not new.	Gake nya siawo menye nu yeye o.
But we don’t have any.	Gake ɖeke mele mía si o.
I should have known something was really wrong	Ðe wòle be manya be nane gblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ hafi
It has been haunting them for almost a year.	Ƒe ɖeka kloe enye sia si wòle fu ɖem na wo.
I don’t know any at all	Nyemenya ɖeke kura o
I had been looking after him	Menɔ edzi kpɔm kpɔ
They have no children together.	Vi aɖeke mele wo si ɖekae o.
I barely got to go out in life	Ƒã hafi mete ŋu do go le agbe me
I tried to tell him a little about them this afternoon.	Medze agbagba be magblɔ wo ŋu nya vi aɖe nɛ ŋdɔ sia.
I don’t know, but it could happen.	Nyemenya o, gake ate ŋu adzɔ.
Perhaps there is a better way.	Ðewohĩ mɔ aɖe li si nyo wu.
The money will come.	Ga la ava.
I did, actually.	Mewɔe, le nyateƒe me.
I think there’s room for some good	Mesusu be mɔnukpɔkpɔ li be woawɔ nyui aɖewo
I couldn’t help liking him	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe eƒe nu lé dzi nam o
The meeting will not proceed.	Kpekpea mayi ŋgɔ o.
Or like a horse.	Alo abe sɔ ene.
I know who he is.	Menya amesi wònye.
I could see contradictions	Mete ŋu kpɔ nya siwo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu
I can’t get my mind off last night	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nye susu ɖa le zã si va yi me o
Usually.	Zi geɖe.
He couldn't quite understand this.	Mete ŋu se nya sia gɔme tututu o.
The plaintiff had personal knowledge.	Ame si tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu la ŋutɔ nya nu tso eŋu.
I operated on you a week ago	Mewɔ dɔ na wò kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia
I think there could always be a better one	Mesusu be esi nyo wu ate ŋu anɔ anyi ɣesiaɣi
I just wanted to talk to him	Ðeko medi be maƒo nu kplii
I told you it was a little weird	Megblɔ na wò be ewɔ nuku vie
I think that was a mistake	Mesusu be vodada aɖee nye ema
You can see that.	Àte ŋu akpɔ ema.
I could just be with them	Ðeko mate ŋu anɔ wo gbɔ
And the work he did.	Eye dɔ si wòwɔ.
This is a very simple thing.	Esia nye nu bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔ.
Everyone gets out eventually.	Amesiame doa go mlɔeba.
Almost every house was affected	Aƒe ɖesiaɖe kloe gblẽ nu le eŋu
I think you can do it	Mesusu be àte ŋu awɔe
I'm still working on one thing.	Megale dɔ wɔm tso nu ɖeka ŋu kokoko.
I could have come or something	Mate ŋu ava alo nane hafi
He won’t make money.	Makpɔ ga o.
I needed some air, and food	Mehiã ya aɖe, kple nuɖuɖu
I think he was tired	Mesusu be ɖeɖi te eŋu
I never want you to do anything else	Nyemedi gbeɖe be nàwɔ nu bubu aɖeke o
The work is over.	Dɔa nu yi.
And you can’t either.	Eye wò hã màte ŋui o.
I don’t have to talk	Mehiã be maƒo nu o
Maybe he didn’t do it soon enough.	Ðewohĩ mewɔe kaba o.
You can find that one.	Àte ŋu akpɔ ɖeka ma.
I distanced myself from him	Meɖe ɖokuinye ɖa le eŋu
Many of them are true.	Wo dometɔ geɖe nye nyateƒe.
He barely said anything to her at all.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke kura nɛ kura o.
I like that part of it.	Akpa ma dzɔa dzi nam.
I can kill you now	Mate ŋu awu wò fifia
I hope we can help each other.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be míate ŋu akpe ɖe mía nɔewo ŋu.
I shouldn’t have talked to you like that	Mele be maƒo nu na wò nenema hafi o
There’s not much room for that now.	Teƒe boo aɖeke meli na ema fifia o.
This is too late.	Esia tsi megbe akpa.
I don’t want you to be alone	Nyemedi be wò ɖeka nanɔ anyi o
But my heart did.	Gake nye dzi ya wɔe nenema.
I know how to find one of them	Menya alesi mawɔ ake ɖe wo dometɔ ɖeka ŋu
He did his part.	Ewɔ eƒe akpa dzi.
But that is nothing new.	Gake ema menye nu yeye o.
That day, he didn’t.	Gbe ma gbe la, mewɔe nenema o.
I have no idea what this is going to do	Nyemenya nusi esia awɔ o
We know enough.	Míenya nusi sɔ gbɔ.
One eye opened.	Ŋku ɖeka ʋu.
I told myself to keep going	Megblɔ na ɖokuinye be mayi edzi
Since he won’t .	Esi wònye be mawɔe o ta la .
All of these things impressed me.	Nu siawo katã wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye.
I hope it does the same for you !	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔe nenema ke na wò hã !
Write everything down.	Ŋlɔ nusianu ɖi.
He should be the only one I have to talk to	Ele be eya ɖeka koe wòle be maƒo nu kplii
You know they are waiting for a lot of air.	Ènya be wole ya geɖe lalam.
I know how petty that sounds	Menya alesi gbegbe nya ma ɖi nu sue aɖee
I wanted to save myself	Medi be maɖe ɖokuinye
I was part of that support	Kpekpeɖeŋu ma ƒe akpa aɖee menye
Otherwise, he couldn’t stand any way if they had to actually fight.	Ne menye nenema o la, mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe mɔ aɖeke nu nenye be ele be woawɔ avu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
It wasn’t like that before.	Menye nenema tsã o.
I was trying to do something positive.	Menɔ agbagba dzem be mawɔ nu nyui aɖe.
I couldn’t stop thinking about it for months and months	Nyemete ŋu dzudzɔ eŋu bubu ɣleti kple ɣleti geɖe o
I have some good news.	Nya nyui aɖewo le asinye.
I expected you a little earlier	Mekpɔ mɔ na wò do ŋgɔ vie
That was our home.	Emae nye míaƒe aƒe.
Do one of each .	Wɔ wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe dometɔ ɖeka .
Everything is brand new.	Nusianu nye nu yeye kura.
Some of them didn’t last a week.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo menɔ anyi kwasiɖa ɖeka o.
Open some songs.	Ʋu ha aɖewo.
None of them ever made any money.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mekpɔ ga aɖeke kpɔ o.
I couldn’t figure out what it was	Nyemete ŋu nya nusi wònye o
This surprised me a bit.	Esia wɔ nuku nam vie.
Maybe he died too.	Ðewohĩ eya hã ku.
We had quite a strict rule.	Se sesẽ aɖe kura nɔ mía si.
I needed the money.	Mehiã ga la.
But think about it now.	Gake bu eŋu kpɔ azɔ.
I don’t have a problem with that.	Nyemekpɔ kuxi aɖeke le ema ŋu o.
It didn’t work.	Mewɔ dɔ o.
There are two reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae.
None of us came close.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mete ɖe eŋu o.
I can’t find anything about it	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ naneke tso eŋu o
I’m not the only one	Menye nye ɖeka koe o
He can let it go.	Ate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu.
But he didn’t.	Gake mewɔe o.
It’s a rather complicated idea.	Enye susu aɖe si me kɔ vie.
I put forward a valid point	Metsɔ nya aɖe si sɔ la ɖo ŋgɔ
I finally lived my life	Meva nɔ nye agbe me mlɔeba
I realized what had just happened.	Mekpɔ nusi dzɔ teti koe nye ema la dze sii.
I resisted that in school.	Metsi tre ɖe nya ma ŋu le suku.
I knew it was a bad idea to come here alone	Menya be enye susu gbegblẽ aɖe be nye ɖeka mava afisia
I asked if we could talk to you	Mebia be míate ŋu aƒo nu kpli wò hã
I couldn’t be here without you	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afisia wò manɔmee o
I remember that sword very well	Meɖo ŋku yi ma dzi nyuie ŋutɔ
It came with almost nothing	Meva kple naneke kloe o
What did he do with.	Nukae wòwɔ kple.
A little something for you	Nane vi aɖe na wò
People need to act, and they need to act now.	Ele be amewo nawɔ nu, eye ele be woawɔ nu fifia.
If you have one, go away.	Ne ɖe le asiwò la, ke dzo.
A man who has lost everything	Ŋutsu aɖe si bu nusianu
In a way, it is.	Le mɔ aɖe nu.
There has to be more to it than that.	Ele be nu geɖe nanɔ eme wu ema.
But if you have more time, you can make them.	Gake ne ɣeyiɣi geɖe le asiwò la, àte ŋu awɔ wo.
I am deeply saddened by this situation	Nɔnɔme sia te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It’s a machine.	Enye mɔ̃ aɖe.
I did what you wanted.	Mewɔ nu si nèdi.

Many of them passed through our house.	Wo dometɔ geɖe to míaƒe aƒea me.
And so is mine.	Eye nenema ke nye tɔ hã le.
We’re talking about that now.	Míele nu ƒom tso ema ŋu fifia.
Nothing will do around the house.	Naneke mawɔ le aƒea me godoo o.
It was what he did best.	Enye nusi wòwɔ nyuie wu.
I did that once.	Mewɔe nenema zi ɖeka.
That was his idea.	Emae nye eƒe susu.
I haven’t been seeing anyone seriously in a long time	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si nyemele ame aɖeke kpɔm vevie o
And that’s a problem.	Eye ema nye kuxi.
I felt terrible for him	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ɖe eŋu
I refused, of course	Megbe ya
Didi found nothing.	Didi mekpɔ naneke o.
Start somewhere of yourself.	Dze egɔme tso wò ŋutɔ wò teƒe aɖe.
Maybe it’s just him.	Ðewohĩ eya koe.
Ask these guys.	Bia ŋutsu siawo.
I like that in a man	Ema dzɔa dzi nam le ŋutsu me
Many people have gone that route	Ame geɖe to mɔ ma dzi
I'm having a great time.	Me le dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔ.
I think it has grown.	Mesusu be edzi ɖe edzi.
This book is a little different.	Agbalẽ sia to vovo vie.
We used to have this, but we don’t have it anymore.	Esia nɔ mía si tsã, gake megale mía si o.
Write down everything that comes to mind.	Ŋlɔ nusianu si va susu me na wò la ɖi.
Throw your mind back.	Tsɔ wò susu ƒu gbe ɖe megbe.
I never knew.	Nyemenya gbeɖe o.
I didn’t see anything wrong	Nyemekpɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
I am also sorry to hear of your loss	Eve nye hã be mese wò nusi bu la
And there it is.	Eye afima hã li.
His character is difficult in many ways.	Eƒe nɔnɔme sesẽ le mɔ geɖe nu.
That would have killed me.	Ema awu nye hafi.
That helped a person.	Ema kpe ɖe ame ŋu.
I saw a lot of people in that place	Mekpɔ ame geɖe le teƒe ma
Write down exactly what you are trying to accomplish.	Ŋlɔ nu si tututu nèle agbagba dzem be yeawɔ la ɖi.
I heard his voice once myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mese eƒe gbe zi ɖeka.
I’m excited about it.	Edzɔ dzi nam.
He should have a big season this year.	Ele be ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe nanɔ esi le ƒe sia me.
He doesn’t come here very often.	Meva afisia zi geɖe o.
I think it will be a quest tonight	Mesusu be anye didi aɖe le zã sia me
Exactly what he was looking for.	Nusi tututu dim wònɔ.
They are waiting for one.	Wole ɖeka lalam.
Make more money.	Kpɔ ga geɖe wu.

There is nothing new there.	Nu yeye aɖeke mele afima o.

So far, the head.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ta.

It’s just not me.	Ðeko menye nyee o.

Or a handful.	Alo asi aɖe.

Now two of them have changed.	Fifia wo dometɔ eve trɔ.
We had some really good people there	Ame nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖewo nɔ mía si le afima
This is a difficult task.	Esia nye dɔ sesẽ aɖe.
I felt like I couldn’t die	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nyemete ŋu ku o
I looked away from him	Meɖe ŋku ɖa le eŋu
I couldn’t see at all.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔa nu kura o.
Its very simple.	Eƒe nu bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I guess that seems about right	Mesusu be edze abe nya ma sɔ ene
Every place will respond.	Teƒe ɖesiaɖe aɖo eŋu.
I have to find my voice	Ele nam be madi nye gbe
We have people like him.	Ame siwo le abe eya ene le mía si.
This is predictable.	Esia nye nusi míate ŋu agblɔ ɖi.
I needed to tell him about me	Ehiã be magblɔ nye ŋu nya nɛ
I only realized this yesterday	Etsɔ koe mekpɔ esia dze sii
I know it was just between us at that point.	Menya be mía dome koe wònɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
I would have stayed in the room otherwise	Anye ne manɔ xɔa me ne menye nenema o la
I know your work very well.	Menya wò dɔa nyuie ŋutɔ.
I was on another mountain	Menɔ to bubu aɖe dzi
I will need to try here.	Ahiã be mate kpɔ le afisia.
There was no chance for one.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi na ɖeka o.
I know his type very well	Menya eƒe ƒomevi la nyuie ŋutɔ
Nor was he always in a position to protect himself.	Eye menɔ nɔnɔme si me wòate ŋu akpɔ eɖokui ta le hã me ɣesiaɣi o.
There is no other plausible possibility.	Nu bubu aɖeke meli si ate ŋu adzɔ si me susu le o.
You are in the house.	Èle aƒea me.
Like a person.	Abe ame ene.
I am ready to work now	Mele klalo be mawɔ dɔ fifia
But I don’t know how to do it.	Gake nyemenya alesi mawɔe o.
But the issue goes much further.	Gake nya la yi ŋgɔ wu ema kura.
This one doesn’t.	Esia mewɔe nenema o.
In fact, the opposite is true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae.
Let me know what you think.	Na manya nusi nèsusu.
I never expected you to do anything	Nyemekpɔ mɔ kpɔ be nàwɔ naneke o
Maybe he was tired.	Ðewohĩ ɖeɖi te eŋu.
I really don’t know what to do.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
I couldn’t get through it	Nyemete ŋu to eme o
It can’t be my dog.	Mate ŋu anye nye avu o.
I know where you are	Menya afi si nèle
And it was very small.	Eye wònɔ sue ŋutɔ.
But maybe you have something.	Gake ɖewohĩ nane le asiwò.
I didn’t feel the same either	Nye hã nyemese le ɖokuinye me be nye hã nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema o
I needed to know what was going on.	Ehiã be manya nu si nɔ edzi yim.
I sure don’t want to end up like that	Meka ɖe edzi be nyemedi be mava wu enu nenema o
Night or day.	Zã alo ŋkeke.
I couldn’t wait for him	Nyemete ŋu nɔ lalam nɛ o
If anything, he’s worse off than ever.	Ne nane li la, ke eƒe lãme gblẽ wu tsã.
It’s not the same thing.	Menye nu ɖeka ma ke o.
I wonder if he still has them.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe wo gakpɔtɔ le esi hã.
Thank you, folks.	Akpe na mi, amewo.
It will take a few more hours.	Axɔ gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo bubu.
I will do whatever you want	Mawɔ nu sia nu si nèdi
It’s only been a month.	Ɣleti ɖeka koe nye esia.
I have omitted two of these words	Meɖe nya siawo dometɔ eve ɖa
I fought to save myself	Mewɔ avu be maɖe ɖokuinye
Build a house.	Tu aƒe aɖe.
That’s my biggest concern.	Emae nye nusi ŋu metsi dzi ɖo wu.
It is why it is so.	Enye nusita wòle nenema ɖo.
I approached one of them	Mete ɖe wo dometɔ ɖeka ŋu
There was a mistake somewhere.	Vodada aɖe dzɔ le afi aɖe.
But, you don’t have any money.	Gake, ga aɖeke mele asiwò o.
You’re just in too much of a hurry.	Ðeko nèle du dzi akpa.
I only came to see you once a week	Meva kpɔ wò zi ɖeka le kwasiɖa me ko
Write as you please.	Ŋlɔ nu alesi nèdi.
No one works here.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa dɔ le afisia o.
Please enter your name here.	Taflatse ŋlɔ wò ŋkɔ ɖe afisia.
Many of them did not understand.	Wo dometɔ geɖe mese egɔme o.
But they are very far apart.	Gake wo dome didi tso wo nɔewo gbɔ ŋutɔ.
I had no clothes to wear	Awu aɖeke menɔ asinye mado o
He did a difficult job.	Ewɔ dɔ sesẽ aɖe.
Everything works fine.	Nusianu wɔa dɔ nyuie.
I can’t do it in either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu awɔe le eme o
He couldn’t give up that easily.	Mete ŋu na ta bɔbɔe nenema o.
I hope he can stay with us	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ate ŋu anɔ mía gbɔ
I had to look away from that	Ele be maɖe ŋku ɖa le ema ŋu
I just can’t do that right now	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔ ema fifia o
I doubted it.	Meke ɖi le eŋu.
I have so many people.	Ame geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye.
But it doesn’t work.	Gake mewɔa dɔ o.
I introduced myself very well.	Meɖe ɖokuinye fia nyuie ŋutɔ.
No one knows this.	Ame aɖeke menya esia o.
Without a word.	Nya aɖeke manɔmee.
He could never allow that.	Mate ŋu aɖe mɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
I never expected him to.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ gbeɖe be awɔe nenema o.
A man will eventually take you from me	Ŋutsu aɖe axɔ wò le asinye mlɔeba
I would have promised him	Medo ŋugbe nɛ hafi
I think my face says it all	Mesusu be nye mo gblɔ wo katã
I knew he was trying	Menya be ele agbagba dzem
I would like to do this very soon if we can.	Madi be mawɔ esia kaba ŋutɔ ne míate ŋui.
It’s grown.	Edzi ɖe edzi.
This will last for a year or so.	Esia anɔ anyi ƒe ɖeka alo esi wu nenema.
I actually enjoyed it a lot	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
I didn’t know what to expect.	Nyemenya nusi makpɔ mɔ na o.
I can’t see anything wrong	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o
He will overcome it.	Aɖu edzi.
Can you help me where am I wrong.	Àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye afikae nye vodada le.
Please, a big drink.	Taflatse, aha gã aɖe.
You’ll be surprised.	Awɔ nuku na wò.
It consists of four parts.	Akpa ene ye le eme.
There is no exception.	Ame aɖeke meli si to vovo na ema o.
Do a good job if he does this on his own.	Wɔ dɔ nyuie ne ewɔ esia le eɖokui si.
Nice to finally meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam be medo go wò mlɔeba.
It’s not a good thing.	Menye nu nyui aɖeke o.
It’s the same job.	Dɔ ɖeka ma ke koe wònye.
I am trying to behave.	Mele agbagba dzem be mawɔ nu.
I started to get angry	Meva nɔ dziku dom
I was surprised and shocked	Ewɔ nuku nam eye wòwɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
Something so personal.	Nane si nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ ale gbegbe.
I don’t understand that either.	Nye hã nyemese nya ma gɔme o.
I think they’re ready now	Mesusu be wole klalo fifia
I’ve already done that	Mewɔe nenema xoxo
This may or may not be true.	Esia ate ŋu anye nyateƒe alo menye nyateƒe o.
I like some of his other songs better	Eƒe ha bubu aɖewo dzɔa dzi nam wu
I really like this guy	Ŋutsu sia dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
I shouldn’t necessarily be here	Mele be manɔ afisia kokoko o
I saw a lot going on	Mekpɔ nu geɖe le edzi yim
I know his house.	Menya eƒe aƒe.
It doesn’t matter, it will do him good.	Mehiã o, awɔ nyui nɛ.
But good manners.	Gake nɔnɔme nyui.
Not for a very long time.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ o.
Show who you are.	Fia amesi nènye.
Add more water, if needed.	Tsɔ tsi bubu kpe ɖe eŋu, ne ehiã.
I was working at night that month	Menɔ dɔ wɔm le zã me le ɣleti ma me
He will need to act now.	Ahiã be wòawɔ nu fifia.
I heard a child went missing here last year	Mese be ɖevi aɖe bu le afisia le ƒe si va yi me
But tell me more about it.	Gake gblɔ nya geɖe nam tso eŋu.
That didn’t last long.	Ema menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
I didn’t have the slightest idea what to do	Nusi mawɔ ƒe susu sue aɖe koe menɔ asinye o
I wanted to do something	Medi be mawɔ nane
Give them what they want.	Na nusi dim wole la wo.
If you have any questions, register.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò la, ke ŋlɔ ŋkɔ.
First to necessary.	Gbãtɔ va ɖo esi hiã dzi.
You, me, everyone.	Wò, nye, amesiame.
I can be there with them	Mate ŋu anɔ afima kpli wo
I think that’s a pretty awkward statement	Mesusu be nya ma nye nya si me susu mele o ŋutɔ
He doesn’t have a big gun.	Tu gã aɖeke mele esi o.
I see what you are looking for	Mekpɔ nu si dim nèle
Something bad will happen.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖe adzɔ.
It’s not me.	Menye nyee o.
I didn’t see anyone, I didn’t hear anything	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke o, nyemese naneke o
We will try you.	Míate wò kpɔ.
But it’s been a long time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
The house is still there.	Aƒea gakpɔtɔ le afima.
He never came to her house.	Meva eƒe aƒeme kpɔ o.
I think you could have done better.	Mesusu be àte ŋu awɔe nyuie wu hafi.
I heard rather than saw	Mese nu tsɔ wu be makpɔ nu
I couldn’t hear from them	Nyemete ŋu se nya aɖeke tso wo gbɔ o
Run on, run on.	Du yi edzi, ƒu du yi edzi.
I can’t come with you	Nyemate ŋu ava kpli wò o
I was really struggling too	Nye hã menɔ agbagba dzem ŋutɔŋutɔ
I know where he was, now	Menya afisi wònɔ, fifia
It’s just a little bit.	Nu sue aɖe koe.
The one who does things.	Ame si wɔa nu.
I miss you so much	Mesusu wò vevie
But if it works well.	Gake ne ewɔ dɔ nyuie la.
I don’t know what else to do.	Nyemenya nu bubu si mawɔ o.
Do this and that.	Wɔ esia kple ema.
I couldn’t say anything	Nyemete ŋu gblɔ nya aɖeke o
It’s like everything else.	Ele abe nusianu ene.
I didn’t know you were here	Nyemenya be èle afisia o
And there is no need for a parallel system.	Eye mehiã be woawɔ ɖoɖo si sɔ kple wo nɔewo o.
I can only do so much	Nu geɖe koe mate ŋu awɔ
The matter came too late.	Nya la va tsi megbe akpa.
You are in charge of the project.	Wòe le dɔa dzi kpɔm.
He didn’t seem to do anything.	Edze abe mewɔ naneke o ene.
You don’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele asiwò o.
I'll work for you anyway	Mawɔ dɔ na wò to mɔ sia mɔ nu
This is a personal one.	Esia nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
I knew I liked him	Menya be eƒe nu lé dzi nam
I was watching them closely	Menɔ wo kpɔm nyuie
I was just kind of surprised	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku nam le mɔ aɖe nu
I got a lot done today.	Mewɔ nu geɖe egbea.
Maybe more often actually.	Ðewohĩ zi geɖe wu le nyateƒe me.
The way it was.	Ale si wònɔ.
This is a fact.	Esia nye nyateƒe.
I organized myself differently	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu le mɔ bubu nu
I think it’s a necessary and important thing to do.	Mesusu be enye nu si hiã eye wòle vevie be woawɔ.
I knew it would work well	Menya be awɔ dɔ nyuie
And my car, too.	Eye nye ʋu hã.
I thought you were something else	Mesusu be nu bubu aɖee nènye
Can't get any bigger on it.	Mate ŋu akpɔ nya gã aɖeke ɖe edzi wu ema o.
I couldn’t let go of it	Nyemete ŋu ɖe asi le eŋu o
I’m glad you said that.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ègblɔ nya ma.
I don’t have to talk.	Mehiã be maƒo nu o.
I started early this morning	Medze egɔme kaba ŋdi sia
I couldn’t do this thing	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nu sia o
I can go alone.	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu ayi.
And, it’s definitely a good idea.	Eye, enye susu nyui aɖe godoo.
Something is right.	Nane sɔ.
Perhaps you have them.	Ðewohĩ wo le asiwò.
It just might take some more time.	Ðeko wòate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖe.
I have something for you	Nya aɖe le asinye na wò
He can’t go home.	Mate ŋu ayi aƒeme o.
That makes the process much easier.	Ema na be dɔa wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
A great man has a great mistake	Vodada gã aɖe le ame gã aɖe ŋu
I really like this guy	Ŋutsu sia dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔŋutɔ
And that feels true.	Eye esia se le eɖokui me be enye nyateƒe.
They don’t need to be brave.	Mehiã be dzi nanɔ wo ƒo o.
I can’t call him when he’s at work	Nyemate ŋu aƒo ka nɛ ne ele dɔme o
But this represents a fair point.	Gake esia tsi tre ɖi na nya si sɔ nyuie.
That’s just a name.	Ŋkɔ aɖe koe nye ema.
Again, this is nothing new.	Le afisia hã la, esia menye nu yeye o.
I really need to tell you something	Ele be magblɔ nya aɖe na wò ŋutɔŋutɔ
Please help me with this.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye le esia ŋu.
After the meeting, you can do so.	Le kpekpea megbe la, àte ŋu awɔe nenema.
I listened in but couldn’t hear anyone	Meɖo to le eme gake nyemete ŋu se ame aɖeke o
I think it will be interesting.	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na ame.
I put every thought out of my head	Meɖe susu ɖesiaɖe ɖa le nye ta me
We know everything about you.	Míenya nusianu tso ŋuwò.
I decided to let it go.	Meɖoe be maɖe asi le eŋu.
Maybe it’s because of money.	Ðewohĩ ga tae.
But, eventually, it will come.	Gake, mlɔeba la, ava.
Not a way at all.	Menye mɔ aɖeke kura o.
These things don’t fit together.	Nu siawo mewɔa ɖeka o.
It was his own.	Eya ŋutɔ tɔ wònye.
And it did a job for him pretty well.	Eye ewɔ dɔ aɖe nɛ nyuie ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t hear anything	Nyemete ŋu se naneke o
I fell on top of him.	Medze anyi ɖe edzi.
Please, help me out.	Meɖe kuku, kpe ɖe ŋunye.
I miss you so much	Mesusu wò vevie ŋutɔ
I don't know what's wrong with me	Nyemenya nu si le fu ɖem nam o
That has to be done.	Ele be woawɔ ema.
But he couldn’t hold back.	Gake mete ŋu lé eɖokui nu o.
It doesn’t matter what someone has been in the past.	Nukae ame aɖe nɔ va yi la mehiã o.
He doesn’t care about money.	Metsɔ ɖeke le ga me o.
I gave him my word, and I kept it.	Metsɔ nye nya la nɛ, eye mewɔ edzi.
I know thousands of things that won’t work	Menya nu akpe geɖe siwo mawɔ dɔ o
The issue is important.	Nya la le vevie.
I couldn’t save his life	Nyemete ŋu ɖe eƒe agbe o
But now things have changed.	Gake fifia la, nuwo trɔ.
I was working.	Menɔ dɔ wɔm.
I welcome you to the right.	Mexɔ wò nyuie.
When he sees people, he can hear them too.	Ne ele amewo kpɔm la, eya hã ate ŋu ase wo.
It was inexpensive and there was no waste.	Mexɔ asi o eye gbegblẽ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
Do whatever work comes your way.	Wɔ dɔ ɖesiaɖe si ava wò.
I promised you a long time ago	Medo ŋugbe na mi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia
But nothing worked for me.	Gake naneke mewɔ dɔ nam o.
There will be more space.	Teƒe geɖe wu ava.
There was no way he was giving up.	Mɔ aɖeke meli si dzi wònɔ asi ɖem le o.
I couldn’t save myself	Nyemete ŋu ɖe ɖokuinye o
But this can be helpful in some situations.	Gake esia ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu le nɔnɔme aɖewo me.
I didn’t think anything at all	Nyemesusu naneke kura o
I think they are better off	Mesusu be wo dome nyo wu
Which is a bad thing.	Nusi nye nu gbegblẽ.
I thought that was awesome	Mesusu be nya ma wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
There are many reasons for this, of course.	Susu geɖe li siwo tae wòle nenema ya.
And this is amazing.	Eye esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There was something stronger about you.	Nane nɔ ŋuwò si sesẽ wu.
Some people have never done it.	Ame aɖewo mewɔe kpɔ o.
It would give me a problem.	Ana kuxi aɖe nam.
We had years apart.	Ƒe geɖe nɔ mía dome.
I saw what no one else did	Mekpɔ nusi ame bubu aɖeke mewɔ o
And that’s not what life is for.	Eye menye ema tae agbe le o.
I can’t stay here	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afisia o
I didn't come.	Meva o.
He didn’t turn them off, or stop them.	Metsi wo o, alo tsi wo nu o.
You definitely can’t meet them here.	Màte ŋu ado go wo le afisia o godoo.
I was really worried about it	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu nyateƒe
I'll try that.	Mate ema kpɔ.
I really want you too	Nye hã medi wò ŋutɔ
The way it stood.	Ale si wònɔ te ɖoe.
No wonder I like her more than you do.	Mewɔ nuku o be eƒe nu lé dzi nam wu wò.
My rifle has a strong enough barrel.	Nye tu ƒe tu sesẽ si sɔ.

Many people were nervous	Ame geɖe tsi dzodzodzoe
Everything was very clear to him.	Nusianu dze ƒã nɛ ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t find any problems	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ kuxi aɖeke o
I couldn’t get in but that didn’t matter	Nyemete ŋu ge ɖe eme o gake ema menɔ vevie o
Too many times.	Zi geɖe akpa.
I don’t want to let go	Nyemedi be maɖe asi le eŋu o
I expressed my opinion.	Megblɔ nye susu.
I couldn’t turn my back on that	Nyemete ŋu trɔ megbe de nya ma o
On that subject.	Le nya ma ŋu.
I have a lot for you in this process	Nu geɖe le asinye na mi le ɖoɖo sia me
We’ll do this and that for you.	Míawɔ esia kple ema na wò.
I recognized myself in it.	Mekpɔ ɖokuinye dze sii le eme.
I think that’s very important	Mesusu be esia le vevie ŋutɔ
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Which is good for us.	Nusi nyo na mí.
Obviously, the same thing has figured it out.	Edze ƒã be nu ma ke hã bu eŋu kpɔ.
It couldn’t have come at a better time in my life.	Mate ŋu ava le ɣeyiɣi si nyo wu me le nye agbe me o.
I need to know who he really is	Ele be manya amesi tututu wònye
It didn’t help.	Meɖe vi aɖeke o.

A few more hours or something.	Gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo bubu alo nane.
Anything is possible.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
I wanted to surprise them	Medi be mawɔ nuku na wo
I can’t understand it	Nyemate ŋu ase egɔme o
I was able to handle this	Mete ŋu kpɔ esia gbɔ
And that includes the police.	Eye kpovitɔwo hã le eme.
I would love to do it	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔe
Just do something.	Ðeko nàwɔ nane.
I can’t do this on my own	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia le ɖokuinye si o
I only saw two of them	Wo dometɔ eve koe mekpɔ
Think about how you are bothering yourself.	Bu ale si nèle fu ɖem na wò la ŋu kpɔ.

What happened is now clear to us.	Nusi dzɔ la me kɔ na mí azɔ.
I know what type it is.	Menya ƒomevi si ƒomevi wònye.
No one took his place	Ame aɖeke mexɔ ɖe eteƒe o

I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I just miss you so much	Ðeko mesusu wò ŋutɔ
I need you to tell me everything	Mehiã be nàgblɔ nya sia nya nam
I tried to say his name	Medze agbagba be magblɔ eƒe ŋkɔ
I knew it would happen	Menya be ava eme
I’ve never seen that happen	Nyemekpɔ nu ma dzɔ kpɔ o
And so far he’s right about everything.	Eye vaseɖe fifia la, eƒe nya le eteƒe le nusianu ŋu.
He has no children.	Vi aɖeke mele esi o.
I didn’t see any other way.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ bubu aɖeke o.
I have already sent a message	Meɖo nya ɖa xoxo
This has become the case.	Esia va le alea.
And there is something else.	Eye nu bubu aɖe hã li.
He didn’t do that, of course.	Mewɔe nenema ya o.
I just want better food	Ðeko medi be nuɖuɖu si nyo wu
But it really was never that easy.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, menɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe gbeɖe o.
I knew what he was doing.	Menya nusi wɔm wònɔ.
I expected nothing but this	Mekpɔ mɔ na naneke gake menye esia o
It couldn’t have come at a better time.	Mate ŋu ava le ɣeyiɣi si nyo wu me hafi o.
This is new to me.	Esia nye yeye nam.
I want to know something personal about you	Medi be manya ame ŋutɔ ƒe nya aɖe tso ŋuwò
Yet every year another part of me can’t wait.	Ke hã ƒe sia ƒe la, nye akpa bubu mete ŋu nɔa lalam o.
And he was angry, too.	Eye eya hã do dziku.
I hope it works out somehow.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ le mɔ aɖe nu.
We have plenty of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe le mía si.
Maybe actually more than that.	Ðewohĩ le nyateƒe me la, esia wu nenema.

I was waiting for this	Menɔ esia lalam
But it doesn’t matter.	Gake mehiã o.

Help me to do that.	Kpe ɖe ŋunye mawɔ ema.
I was worried it might kill you	Metsi dzi be ɖewohĩ awu wò
There were quite a few people involved.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ hã nɔ eme.
They all appeal to me.	Wo katã doa dzidzɔ nam.
There is no literature on this problem yet.	Agbalẽ aɖeke meli si ƒo nu tso kuxi sia ŋu haɖe o.
I know exactly what you are	Menya nusi tututu nènye
Nothing is more important than another.	Nu aɖeke mele vevie wu bubu o.
I wondered what it all meant	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae wo katã fia hã
Me and you.	Nye kple wò.
I know you.	Menya wo.
All things have a type.	Nuwo katã ƒe ƒomevi aɖe le wo si.

This really shouldn’t be surprising.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele be esia nawɔ nuku o.

I should have said something earlier	Ðe wòle be magblɔ nya aɖe do ŋgɔ hafi
I was in charge here	Nyee nye amesi nɔ dɔa dzi kpɔm le afisia
Now he had four men to deal with.	Fifia ŋutsu ene nɔ esi wòawɔ nu kplii.
You can’t look away.	Màte ŋu akpɔ nu ɖa o.
He had never felt that way before.	Mese le eɖokui me nenema kpɔ o.

That’s not like any of them.	Ema mele abe wo dometɔ aɖeke ene o.
But that day may never come.	Gake ɖewohĩ ŋkeke ma mava gbeɖe o.
I was really worried about you, actually	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò ŋutɔŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me
You know you have to live without it.	Ènya be ele be yeanɔ agbe manɔmee.
He was seriously ill.	Edze dɔ vevie.
I’m sure its the same thing for him.	Meka ɖe edzi be eƒe nu ma ke na eya hã.
Obviously something is very, very wrong there.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ le afima.
I took a step towards the room	Meɖe afɔ aɖe ɖo ta xɔa gbɔ
I didn’t see his face.	Nyemekpɔ eƒe mo o.
He has two problems in this context.	Kuxi eve le eŋu le nya sia me.
I had to protect myself	Ele be makpɔ ɖokuinye ta
There is nothing these people won’t do.	Naneke meli si ame siawo mawɔ o.
But it wasn’t me.	Gake menye nyee o.
I should never have been in that situation	Mele be manɔ nɔnɔme ma me gbeɖe o
Maybe that can help you.	Ðewohĩ ema ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
There’s a book in there somewhere.	Agbalẽ aɖe le afima le afi aɖe.
And it will be quick.	Eye wòawɔ kaba.
That’s what’s interesting.	Emae nye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame.
I needed a replacement.	Mehiã ame aɖe si axɔ ɖe eteƒe.
I reached over my face.	Medo asi ɖe nye mo dzi.
A good attitude is enough.	Nɔnɔme nyui aɖe sɔ gbɔ.
And that also seems to me to be a good life.	Eye ema hã dze nam be enye agbe nyui aɖe.
Look at something else.	Kpɔ nu bubu aɖe hã ɖa.
Which is kind of hard.	Nusi nye nu sesẽ aɖe ƒomevi.
I guess its not a bad thing.	Mesusu be eƒe menye nu gbegblẽ o.
I know I have to	Menya be ele nam
Those who are not old enough.	Ame siwo metsi o.
I’ve never seen that before.	Nyemekpɔ nu ma kpɔ o.
I’ve never seen anyone	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke kpɔ o
It will feel like home, something missing now.	Ase le eɖokui me abe aƒe ene, nane si bu fifia.
I just couldn’t remember who I was	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku amesi nye dzi o
As if he was looking back at her.	Abe ɖe wòle megbe kpɔm nɛ ene.
He didn’t want to stay.	Medi be yeanɔ anyi o.
This is a job.	Esia nye dɔ.
I needed to get out of this	Ehiã be mado le esia me
I can’t live like this	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe alea o
Somehow none of them touched them.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, wo dometɔ aɖeke meka asi wo ŋu o.
We know what everyone else can do.	Míenya nu si ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ate ŋu awɔ.
And it was a great moment.	Eye enye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
It’s never a bad thing.	Menye nu gbegblẽ aɖeke gbeɖe o.
He will come to understand her neck.	Ava se eƒe kɔ gɔme.
I am satisfied with it.	Nye dzi dze eme le eŋu.
It would be very nice.	Anyo ŋutɔ.
Just.	Ko.
I really hope we can figure that out	Mele mɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ be míate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ
I can’t remember where there.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku afi si afi ma dzi o.
He was someone completely different, someone new.	Enye ame aɖe si to vovo kura, ame yeye aɖe.
I was as surprised as anyone else	Mewɔ nuku nam abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene
I just don’t know what’s wrong	Ðeko nyemenya nusi gblẽ o
I would like to know more than this	Madi be manya nu geɖe wu esia
I plan to do the same this year	Meɖoe be mawɔ nenema ke le ƒe sia me hã
I had been really struggling	Menɔ agbagba dzem ŋutɔŋutɔ tsã
I can see so much this way	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu geɖe ŋutɔ le mɔ sia nu
I’m glad you liked it	Edzɔ dzi nam be edzɔ dzi na wò
He won’t see you here.	Makpɔ wò le afisia o.
Or maybe in the past few seasons	Alo ɖewohĩ le ɣeyiɣi ʋɛ aɖewo siwo va yi me
I did have some good years	Ƒe nyui aɖewo nɔ asinye nyateƒe
I don’t have a voice.	Gbe aɖeke mele asinye o.
He is not at home.	Mele aƒeme o.
I gave him one, you gave him one.	Metsɔ ɖeka nɛ, wòe tsɔ ɖeka nɛ.
It was one of the few things that could not have happened.	Enye nu ʋɛ siwo mate ŋu adzɔ hafi o la dometɔ ɖeka.
There’s a little bad blood in there	Ʋu gbegblẽ vi aɖe le afima
And he didn’t want to go.	Eye medi be yeayi o.
You can see the house.	Àte ŋu akpɔ aƒea.
Obviously, that is also true.	Edze ƒã be ema hã nye nyateƒe.
I might join this challenge	Ðewohĩ mawɔ ɖeka kple kuxi sia
That’s a good thing in many ways.	Ema nye nu nyui aɖe le go geɖe me.
He will be there too.	Eya hã anɔ afima.
The house is the only house	Aƒe koe nye aƒe
Tell me how it is for you.	Gblɔ alesi wòle na wò nam.
A new life, together	Agbe yeye, ɖekae
For so many years, my life was pretty simple.	Ƒe geɖe ŋutɔ la, nye agbe nɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I usually do this the night before	Zi geɖe la, mewɔa esia le zã si do ŋgɔ me
Not that it really matters.	Menye ɖe wòle vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I told myself that neither he nor anyone else cared	Megblɔ na ɖokuinye be eya alo ame bubu aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme o
He didn't know anything different.	Menya nusi to vovo kura o.
I wanted to try on some of my old clothes	Medi be mate nye awu xoxo aɖewo kpɔ
Much like you, actually.	Geɖe abe wò ene, le nyateƒe me.
I should be happy about that	Ele be makpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe nya ma ŋu
I can’t remember it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi o.
We cannot simply act on that.	Míate ŋu awɔ nu ɖe ​​ema dzi ko o.
I just didn’t expect it	Ðeko nyemekpɔ mɔ nɛ o
I am interested in your work	Metsɔ ɖe le wò dɔa me
A difficult one, but a plan nonetheless	Sesẽ aɖe, gake ɖoɖo aɖee wònye ke hã
And that seems reasonable to me.	Eye esia dze nam abe susu le eme ene.
That was another thing on his mind.	Ema hã nye nu bubu si nɔ susu me nɛ.
I can’t believe this.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ esia dzi ase o.
I think this is a good idea	Mesusu be esia nye susu nyui aɖe
Something is different in me.	Nane to vovo le menye.
I really don’t know what to do now	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi mawɔ fifia o
Why anyone would come out for that is beyond me.	Nusita ame aɖe ado tso eme na ema la gbɔ nye ŋutɔ.
I have a life to live.	Agbe aɖe le asinye manɔ.
But I don’t know.	Gake nyemenya o.
I can go to school now, finally	Mate ŋu ayi suku azɔ, mlɔeba
You can improve there.	Àte ŋu anyo ɖe edzi le afima.
He had so many people in his life, so many jobs.	Ame geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ esi le eƒe agbe me, dɔ geɖe nɔ esi.
You are not alone.	Ga le esi.
I can only imagine what he is going through.	Nusi me tom wòle la koe mate ŋu akpɔ le susu me.
I think that’s a good idea	Mesusu be susu nyui aɖee nye ema
I have not been able to prove this.	Nyemete ŋu ɖo kpe esia dzi o.
Please reject these moments, for real and not otherwise.	Taflatse gbe ɣeyiɣi siawo, le nyateƒe me eye menye nenema o.
I didn’t see a gun or anything.	Nyemekpɔ tu alo naneke o.
Car.	Ʋu.
There used to be an idea at work here	Susu aɖe nɔ dɔ wɔm le afisia tsã
I have very little time	Ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe koe le asinye
Work more, do more.	Wɔ dɔ geɖe wu, wɔ geɖe wu.
And there were times when.	Eye ɣeyiɣi aɖewo nɔ anyi siwo me...
I now had a new desire.	Didi yeye aɖe va nɔ asinye fifia.
That’s what helped me out tonight.	Emae nye nusi kpe ɖe ŋunye medo go le zã sia me.
I wasn’t happy but that’s normal.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o gake esia nye nusi sɔ.
I can’t see clearly.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔa nu nyuie o.
It’s what’s there.	Enye nusi le afima.
Or tomorrow morning.	Alo etsɔ ŋdi.
The whole system of reality seems impossible.	Edze abe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ƒe ɖoɖo bliboa mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.
This is an issue for the police.	Esia nye nya na kpovitɔwo.
He can’t live without me.	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe nye manɔmee o.
Or at least he tried to.	Alo edze agbagba ya teti.
I couldn’t figure out what was going on	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi nɔ edzi yim la me o
I’m sorry, but he can’t.	Meɖe kuku, gake mate ŋui o.
I don’t want to see you	Nyemedi be makpɔ wò o
I couldn’t believe it	Nyemete ŋu xɔ edzi se o
If you could talk to him, it would be great.	Ne àte ŋu aƒo nu kplii la, anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
You can definitely do it.	Àte ŋu awɔe godoo.
Great city, very lively	Du gã aɖe, si le agbe ŋutɔ
This is just too personal.	Ðeko esia nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa.
Ema on.	Ema ku.
A difficult situation	Nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe
He didn’t tell any lies.	Megblɔ alakpa aɖeke o.
We could have done better this year	Míate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu le ƒe sia me hafi
I didn’t see his death	Nyemekpɔ eƒe ku o
I am expecting too much.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na nu geɖe akpa.
That may have been true in the past, but it is no longer.	Ðewohĩ nya ma nye nyateƒe tsã, gake megale nenema o.
I shouldn’t be watching this	Mele be manɔ esia kpɔm o
Everyone has to make a name for themselves.	Ele be amesiame nawɔ ŋkɔ na eɖokui.
None of them could do anything.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
That would be a new market for them.	Ema anye asi yeye aɖe na wo.
Maybe it was because he had so much to say.	Ðewohĩ esi nya geɖe nɔ esi tae.
Maybe I was wrong.	Ðewohĩ mewɔ vodada.
I gave one to each of them	Metsɔ ɖeka na wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe
I just remember that day	Ðeko meɖo ŋku ŋkeke ma dzi
I couldn’t let go of it	Nyemete ŋu ɖe asi le eŋu o
I’m just a kid.	Nyee nye vi aɖe ko.
I am now in charge of the project.	Nyee le dɔa dzi kpɔm fifia.
I seemed to be doing this a lot.	Edze abe menɔ esia wɔm geɖe ene.
I can’t answer you.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo eŋu na wò o.
He had my back	Nye megbe nɔ eŋu
I'm just not sure it's a good idea	Ðeko nyemeka ɖe edzi be enye susu nyui aɖe o
A lot of people didn’t get that much	Ame geɖe mexɔ nu geɖe nenema o
I can’t do this to them	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia ɖe wo ŋu o
More money too.	Ga geɖe wu hã.
Now that would be something.	Fifia ema anye nane.
But there was no one there.	Gake ame aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I have no idea what kind of place this is	Nyemenya teƒe si ƒomevi esia nye o
I wonder what happened to me	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae dzɔ ɖe dzinye hã
Its not like this is new.	Eƒe menye abe ɖe esia nye nu yeye ene o.
Not a long time ago.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia o.
A man making a name for himself	Ŋutsu aɖe si le ŋkɔ wɔm
I can’t eat anymore	Nyemate ŋu aɖu nu azɔ o
I can't figure out how to make this work.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi mawɔ be esia nawɔ dɔ o.
But there is no life.	Gake agbe aɖeke meli o.
I thought my life was over.	Mesusu be nye agbe wu enu.
He worked on his neck.	Ewɔ dɔ le eƒe kɔ ŋu.
I must say something briefly	Ele be magblɔ nya aɖe kpuie
I have good news for you	Nya nyui aɖe le asinye na mi
On behalf of all of us.	Le mí katã teƒe.
I expect the same here.	Mekpɔ mɔ nenema ke le afisia hã.
None other than .	Ame bubu aɖeke meli wu .
I have my own opinion on that	Nye ŋutɔ nye susu le nya ma ŋu
I remember thinking it would be so quick, so easy.	Meɖo ŋku edzi be mesusu be awɔ kaba ale gbegbe, anɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
Do what you want.	Wɔ nusi nèdi.
It will improve your concentration.	Ana wò susu nanɔ nu ŋu nyuie wu.
This is a real thing.	Esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I want to punch that face	Medi be maƒo mo ma
I had nothing better to do.	Nu bubu aɖeke menɔ asinye mawɔ si nyo wu ema o.
Maybe things were going well now.	Ðewohĩ nuwo nɔ edzi yim nyuie fifia.
No one could find him.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
I have something.	Nane le asinye.
Thank you everyone.	Akpe na mi amesiame.
This is obvious.	Esia dze ƒã.
I think we can probably find out	Mesusu be míate ŋu anya ɖewohĩ
This may not be the case.	Ðewohĩ esia manɔ nenema o.
I watched for a moment, see what he would do	Mekpɔ nu vie, kpɔ nusi wòawɔ ɖa
It’s a big part.	Enye akpa gã aɖe.
It seemed smaller.	Edze abe ɖe wòle sue wu ene.
He has a first name and a last name.	Ŋkɔ gbãtɔ kple ŋkɔ mamlɛtɔ le esi.
This seems strange.	Esia dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ene.
I didn’t have a normal life	Menye agbe si sɔ la nɔ asinye o
And somehow another year came to an end.	Eye le mɔ aɖe nu la, ƒe bubu va wu enu.
I was trying to find out	Menɔ agbagba dzem be manya
Head and neck.	Ta kple kɔ.
He enjoys new and unfamiliar situations.	Nɔnɔme yeye siwo menya o la dzɔa dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I am going to call the police and report this.	Mele ka ƒom na kpovitɔwo agblɔ nya sia.
A very small part of me was satisfied	Nye akpa sue aɖe ŋutɔ ƒe dzi dze eme
And the market fell.	Eye asi la dze anyi.
I said, maybe tomorrow	Megblɔ be, ɖewohĩ etsɔ
He has my job.	Nye dɔ le esi.
But not now, not now.	Gake menye fifia o, menye fifia o.
You can’t control this.	Màte ŋu aɖu esia dzi o.
It was a huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖee.
That’s not a waste of time.	Ema menye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ o.
Stick with me and everything.	Lé ɖe ŋunye kple nusianu.
I remember that one well	Meɖo ŋku ɖeka ma dzi nyuie
A little does so much here	Vi aɖe wɔa nu geɖe ŋutɔ le afisia
I'm not really sure why he was doing that	Nyemeka ɖe nusita wònɔ nu ma wɔm dzi tututu o
Probably a lot of things.	Ðewohĩ nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
I went out to my room	Medo go yi nye xɔ me
And there isn’t one.	Eye ɖeke mele eme o.
He couldn’t do anything for me.	Mete ŋu wɔ naneke nam o.
Everyone saw what happened	Amesiame kpɔ nusi dzɔ
I'll hold my hand.	Ma lé nye asi.
He will not live.	Manɔ agbe o.
I can only see his back	Eƒe megbe koe mate ŋu akpɔ
But it can get too hot.	Gake ate ŋu axɔ dzo akpa.
But it never works.	Gake mewɔa dɔ gbeɖe o.
I was there, but my mind wasn’t there	Menɔ afima, gake nye susu menɔ afima o
Good idea, folks.	Susu nyui, amewo.
I had to do something	Ele be mawɔ nane
I tried many ideas, but none worked.	Mete susu geɖe kpɔ, gake ɖeke mewɔ dɔ o.
If only we had known about you before	Ne ɖe míenya nu tso ŋuwò do ŋgɔ hafi
It’s a difficult issue.	Enye nya sesẽ aɖe.
I knew what he was doing.	Menya nu si wɔm wònɔ.
But no book exists in a vacuum.	Gake agbalẽ aɖeke meli le teƒe si me naneke mele o me o.
You are something.	Wòe nye nu aɖe.
Forget about taking time or doing something for herself.	Ŋlɔ ɣeyiɣi didi alo nane wɔwɔ na eɖokui be.
This is a very good one.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ.
I think you can do a lot better	Mesusu be àte ŋu awɔ nu nyui geɖe wu
I want you to say this behind my back.	Medi be nàgblɔ nya sia le nye megbe.
I don’t mean to be personal	Menye ɖe meɖoe be maƒo nu tso ame ŋutɔ ŋu o
That was that for him.	Emae nye ema nɛ.
That’s anger in me as well.	Ema nye dziku le menye hã.
I understand why no one knows what this means	Mese nusita ame aɖeke menya nusi nya sia fia o la gɔme
There are few opportunities there.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe le afima.
I need to talk to you	Ehiã be maƒo nu kpli wò
There can be no mistake.	Vodada aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
Try a few of them.	Do wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo kpɔ.
Things are actually better.	Nuwo nyo wu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And there seems to be another scenario.	Eye edze abe nɔnɔme bubu aɖe hã li ene.
I have posted the following	Metsɔ nya siwo gbɔna la da ɖe afima
Part of his mind still knew where he was	Eƒe susu ƒe akpa aɖe gakpɔtɔ nya afisi wòle
I know where he is	Menya afisi wòle
There was absolutely no way.	Mɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi kura o.
And who it could be.	Eye amesi wòate ŋu anye.
I can only hope that is true	Ðeko mate ŋu akpɔ mɔ be nya ma nye nyateƒe
I thought it was amazing	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ
Or consider another aspect.	Alo bu akpa bubu aɖe ŋu.
I almost did it myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mewɔe kloe.
He had a job to do.	Dɔ aɖe nɔ esi wòawɔ.
Do it at home.	Wɔe le aƒeme.
I’ve done enough of that in my life.	Mewɔ ema sɔ gbɔ le nye agbe me.
But that’s enough for now.	Gake esia sɔ gbɔ fifia.
I have two dogs, my own space	Avu eve le asinye, nye ŋutɔ nye teƒe
I did want to go home.	Medi be mayi aƒeme nyateƒe.
Maybe in a small way, not what he expected.	Ðewohĩ le mɔ sue aɖe nu, ke menye nusi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na o.
Think about that, say that to a child.	Bu nya ma ŋu, nàgblɔ nya ma na ɖevi aɖe.
And tell us what you think!.	Eye nàgblɔ wò susu!.
I don’t want to have that truth.	Nyemedi be nyateƒe ma nanɔ asinye o.
The only rule is that there are no rules	Se ɖeka koe nye be se aɖeke meli o
I know you have a busy schedule	Menya be vovo mele ŋuwò o le asiwò
I just can't handle that yet	Ðeko nyemete ŋu kpɔa ema gbɔ haɖe o
This time he couldn’t.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, mete ŋui o.
I will definitely do it.	Mawɔe godoo.
I wouldn’t mind that kind of work	Dɔ ma ƒomevi maɖe fu nam o
That couldn’t be worse.	Ema mate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ wu ema o.
I’m glad you’re satisfied.	Edzɔ dzi nam be wò dzi dze eme.
And you are, too.	Eye wò hã nèle.
Nothing has come out of them yet.	Naneke medo tso wo me haɖe o.
I finally found you and we can be together now	Meva ke ɖe ŋuwò mlɔeba eye míate ŋu anɔ anyi ɖekae fifia
It may be true.	Ate ŋu anye be enye nyateƒe.
I didn’t know until much later	Nyemenya o vaseɖe esime ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe megbe
Your home can handle a lot.	Wò aƒe ate ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe gbɔ.
We know who is in charge.	Míenya amesi le dɔa dzi kpɔm.
One reason is very important.	Susu ɖeka aɖe le vevie ŋutɔ.
I wondered where he had been	Mebia ɖokuinye be afikae wònɔ tsã hã
But they will work.	Gake woawɔ dɔ.
I had too much on my mind.	Nu geɖe nɔ susu me nam akpa.
And maybe for good reason.	Eye ɖewohĩ susu nyui aɖe tae.
I could hardly believe what came out of my mouth	Nyemete ŋu xɔ nusi do tso nye nu me dzi se kura o
For whoever is not against us is for us.	Ame sia ame si metsi tre ɖe mía ŋu o la le mía ta.
We had no one else to do them.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ mía si awɔ wo o.
I got some heat but I wanted to go home	Mexɔ dzo aɖe gake medi be mayi aƒeme
However, that is not true.	Ke hã, nya ma menye nyateƒe o.
There is no personal space.	Ame ŋutɔ ƒe teƒe aɖeke meli o.
He didn’t see anything.	Mekpɔ naneke o.
Only one night here.	Zã ɖeka koe le afisia.
But this is a reality.	Gake esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I thought we might have a problem, a big problem	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ kuxi aɖe anɔ mía ŋu, kuxi gã aɖe
Something else is needed.	Nu bubu aɖe hiã.
I know all about it	Menya nu tso eŋu katã
I stopped right inside	Meva tɔ ɖe eme tututu
I would be very surprised.	Mawɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
That part worked.	Akpa ma wɔ dɔ.
Under a slightly different arrangement.	Le ɖoɖo si to vovo vie te.
I couldn’t think of anything to say	Nyemete ŋu bu nya aɖeke ŋu magblɔ o
I just really need to know	Ðeko wòle be manya ŋutɔŋutɔ
I think that’s a great point.	Mesusu be nya gã aɖee nye ema.
It’s been amazing so far.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ vaseɖe fifia.
I was just trying to stay alive	Ðeko menɔ agbagba dzem be manɔ agbe
I decided to call them	Meɖoe be maƒo ka na wo
You don’t want to go up like that.	Mèdi be yeayi dzi nenema o.
I just couldn’t have heard that.	Nyemate ŋu ase nya ma ko hafi o.
I said something like.	Megblɔ nya aɖe abe.
He had no chance with any.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke menɔ esi kple ɖeke o.
I have to live for a reason.	Susu aɖe tae wòle be manɔ agbe ɖo.
I can go on and on	Mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ nu ƒom
But he cannot see these two things.	Gake mate ŋu akpɔ nu eve siawo o.
I couldn’t be happier or happier with the end result.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ alo akpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe nusi ado tso eme mlɔeba ŋu wu ema o.
I need to do something about that	Ele be mawɔ nane tso ema ŋu

I had to deal with it all myself	Ele be nye ŋutɔ makpɔ wo katã gbɔ
It’s a two-person project.	Enye ame eve ƒe dɔ.

I was so worried about it.	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe.

Anything can go up.	Nusianu ate ŋu ayi dzi.
That is a very good thing.	Ema nye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I have no problem doing this again, if need be	Kuxi aɖeke mele ŋunye le esia wɔwɔ ake me o, ne ehiã
He obviously likes a challenge.	Edze ƒã be kuxi aɖe dzɔa dzi nɛ.
That was very important to him.	Ema nɔ vevie nɛ ŋutɔ.
He might have a problem.	Ðewohĩ kuxi aɖe anɔ eŋu.

I was hoping there might be someone.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be ɖewohĩ ame aɖe anɔ anyi.
Now tell me what you want.	Azɔ gblɔ nusi dim nèle nam.
I still don’t know anything	Nyemenya naneke kokoko o
Maybe there is nothing in it.	Ðewohĩ naneke mele eme o.
One piece of that is missing.	Ema ƒe akpa ɖeka bu.
I have to stay with them	Ele be manɔ wo gbɔ
I can’t understand it.	Nyemate ŋu ase egɔme o.
There was no one else.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I didn’t expect it.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ nɛ o.

It was a very fluid time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi si me tsi le ŋutɔ.

I couldn’t help it, but he didn’t care	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o, gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme o
It will never be like that.	Manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
Maybe this is a dead end.	Ðewohĩ mɔ si dzi ame aɖeke mele o ye nye esia.
That’s the only reason.	Ema koe nye susu si tae.
I was a little worried	Metsi dzi vie
It’s too much good stuff.	Enye nu nyui siwo sɔ gbɔ akpa.

We can set some conditions.	Míate ŋu aɖo nɔnɔme aɖewo ɖi.
I know how they are	Menya alesi wole
A problem arose.	Kuxi aɖe do mo ɖa.
I wanted him alone, helpless	Medi be eya ɖeka koe, si mate ŋu awɔ naneke o
Not sure if that is possible	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be ema anya wɔ o
I was near a large body of water	Mete ɖe tsi gã aɖe ŋu
It hasn’t been easy for me, you know.	Meva le bɔbɔe nam o, ènya.
I liked the whole situation.	Nɔnɔme bliboa dze ŋunye.

I know it happened somehow	Menya be edzɔ le mɔ aɖe nu
I just want to see you	Ðeko medi be makpɔ wò
It's here.	Ele afisia.
It is illegal for police officers to go on strike	Mele se nu be kpovitɔwo nawɔ dɔ le dɔme o
I knew only one of us could go	Menya be mía dometɔ ɖeka koe ate ŋu ayi
It can be a reasonable thing.	Ate ŋu anye nusi sɔ.
And there was something else.	Eye nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
I almost didn’t feel like finding it	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kloe be mava ke ɖe eŋu o
That is a simple matter.	Nya bɔbɔe aɖee nye ema.
I can’t do this, not like this	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia o, menye alea o
I wasn’t expecting him to talk about it	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be maƒo nu tso eŋu o
All of these things will be fine.	Nu siawo katã anyo.
I am in charge of everything	Nyee le nusianu dzi kpɔm
I told him so much about it	Megblɔ nya geɖe ŋutɔ tso eŋu nɛ
Any sane person, anyway.	Ame sia ame si si susu le, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
There are many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe li.
I will go to work and do my job	Mayi dɔme eye mawɔ nye dɔ
I can do that at home	Mate ŋu awɔ ema le aƒeme
If it weren’t true, it wouldn’t, but it is	Ne ɖe menye nyateƒe o la, anye ne mewɔe nenema o, gake ele nenema
But this is not normal conditions.	Gake esia menye nɔnɔme siwo sɔ o.
Something seemed to be wrong with each of them.	Edze abe nane gblẽ le wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ŋu ene.
I needed a job and I’m still working.	Mehiã dɔ eye megale dɔ wɔm kokoko.
It fell a little bit.	Edze anyi vie vie.
It looked bad.	Edze nu gbegblẽ.
He didn’t get angry.	Medo dziku o.
That stuff is so much a part of it.	Nu ma nye eƒe akpa aɖe ale gbegbe.
That worked really well.	Ema wɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Could he put that out of his mind now.	Ðe wòate ŋu aɖe nya ma ɖa le susu me fifia.
I got the room for him	Mexɔ xɔa nɛ
But help never came.	Gake kpekpeɖeŋu meva kpɔ o.

I should never have done that	Mele be mawɔ nu ma gbeɖe o

You are a good man.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖee nènye.
Please, help me out.	Taflatse, kpe ɖe ŋunye.

But something is bothering me.	Gake nane le fu ɖem nam.

They had no heart.	Dzi aɖeke menɔ wo si o.

A lot can happen in that time	Nu geɖe ate ŋu adzɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma me
It’s something.	Enye nu aɖe.

I'm having a really hard time with this.	Mele ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ me tom le esia ŋu.
I saw you with them.	Mekpɔ wò le wo gbɔ.
You are going to save my life.	Èle nye agbe xɔ ge.
I will look in my own room	Makpɔ nye ŋutɔ nye xɔ me
I will tell him that too	Magblɔ nya ma hã nɛ
I was very angry with him	Medo dziku nɛ vevie
It’s something completely different	Enye nusi to vovo kura
Take your time.	Di wò ɣeyiɣi.
We don’t know that it is.	Míenya be ele nenema o.
I couldn’t get them out of the house.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe wo le aƒea me o.
I just didn’t know what to say to her	Ðeko nyemenya nya si magblɔ nɛ o
But come on in, everyone.	Gake va ge ɖe eme, amesiame.
I don't know how to proceed from here nothing works.	Nyemenya alesi mayi edzi tso afisia naneke mewɔa dɔ o.

He couldn’t hear every word.	Mete ŋu se nya sia nya o.

At this time, no one seems to be home.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, edze abe ame aɖeke mele aƒeme o ene.
And so is my other dog.	Eye nenema ke nye avu bubu hã le.

I have to keep trying!.	Ele be mayi edzi anɔ agbagba dzem!.
I have never been so happy.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
Look at the bright side.	Kpɔ akpa si me kɔ la ɖa.
I was pleased with him	Edzɔ dzi nam ɖe eŋu

I am very interested in this	Metsɔ ɖe le nya sia me vevie ŋutɔ

Focus on the positive.	Lé fɔ ɖe nu siwo akpe ɖe ame ŋu la ŋu.
I wanted to do things differently	Medi be mawɔ nuwo le mɔ bubu nu
Maybe we can get away with that.	Ðewohĩ míate ŋu asi le ema me.
It was so much fun for him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ale gbegbe.
It is in everything.	Ele nu sia nu me.
It didn’t quite work that way.	Mewɔ dɔ nenema tututu o.
That’s the right thing to do.	Emae nye nusi sɔ.
None of it made sense.	Susu menɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke me o.
I was able to calm him down.	Mete ŋu na eƒe dzi dze eme.
This continues to be difficult.	Esia yi edzi nye nu sesẽ aɖe.

I still don’t know what he did, what he did	Nyemenya nusi wòwɔ, nusi wòwɔ la haɖe o
Nyemedi doesn't	Nyemedi ga o
That was all I was worried about	Ðeko metsi dzi ɖe eŋu ema koe nye ema
I want to do the job.	Medi be mawɔ dɔa.
I couldn’t keep my mouth shut.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ nye nu ƒom o.

Many of them are still there.	Wo dometɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ le afima.
There was no one in his room.	Ame aɖeke menɔ eƒe xɔa me o.
I think that’s a little harsh	Mesusu be nya ma nye nya sesẽ aɖe vie
Maybe I got sick at night.	Ðewohĩ mexɔ dɔ le zã me.
Tomorrow is a new day.	Etsɔ nye ŋkeke yeye.
Put one foot on it.	Tsɔ afɔ ɖeka da ɖe edzi.

Thank you all for that.	Akpe na mi katã ɖe ema ta.
He didn’t see any horses.	Mekpɔ sɔ aɖeke o.
I couldn’t hold them in my face	Nyemete ŋu lé wo nu le nye mo me o
Just think of me.	Bu ŋunye ko.
I really like your good works	Wò dɔ nyui siwo nèwɔ la dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
I can’t help myself though	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o ke hã
I don’t understand it at all myself	Nye ŋutɔ nyemese egɔme kura o
I was in very good shape.	Menɔ nɔnɔme nyui me ŋutɔ.
I can’t refuse this life	Nyemate ŋu agbe agbe sia o
I have only a few words to say	Nya ʋɛ aɖewo koe le asinye magblɔ
I was more nervous than he was.	Metsi dzodzodzoe wu eya.
But it makes sense.	Gake susu le eme.
But that’s all the point.	Gake nya la koe nye ema.
It would never be any other way.	Manɔ mɔ bubu aɖeke nu gbeɖe o.
I want to be for something, not just for someone.	Medi be manɔ nane ta, ke menye ɖe ame aɖe ŋu ko o.

I needed to stay sane after all	Ehiã be nye susu nanɔ dɔ dzi le nuwo katã megbe
I have to find me a horse	Ele be madi sɔ nam
Please come and join us on our big day.	Taflatse va kpe ɖe mía ŋu le míaƒe ŋkeke gã la dzi.
I’ve never had a bullet actually touch me	Nyemekpɔ tu aɖeke ka asi ŋunye ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o
I was a little surprised but pleased.	Ewɔ nuku nam vie gake edzɔ dzi nam.
I just remembered something else	Ðeko meɖo ŋku nu bubu aɖe dzi
I had to meet someone	Ele be mado go ame aɖe
I just did it to have fun	Ðeko mewɔe be makpɔ dzidzɔ
I know exactly where we are	Menya afisi tututu míele
Like your car.	Abe wò ʋu ene.
I tried to spit it out	Medze agbagba be maɖe ta ɖe eme
I can promise you that	Mate ŋu ado esia ƒe ŋugbe na wò
He has my heart.	Nye dzi le esi.
We had a job to do.	Dɔ nɔ mía si míawɔ.
I have a lot to say about that book.	Nya geɖe le asinye magblɔ tso agbalẽ ma ŋu.
I prayed that we could endure	Medo gbe ɖa be míate ŋu ado dzi
I understand you have some	Mese egɔme be ame aɖewo le asiwò
I could never get myself to do it	Nyemate ŋu ana ɖokuinye mawɔe gbeɖe o
Everyone gets mad at everyone else.	Amesiame doa dziku ɖe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ŋu.
It certainly surprised me.	Ewɔ nuku nam godoo.
I think we can do another project	Mesusu be míate ŋu awɔ dɔ bubu aɖe
But now that seems highly unlikely.	Gake azɔ edze abe ema mate ŋu adzɔ kura o ene.
You are speaking for your life.	Èle nu ƒom ɖe wò agbe ta.
I’m not sure how I’m going to achieve that.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be aleke mawɔ aɖo ema gbɔ o.
But you have a lot on that.	Gake nu geɖe le asiwò le ema ŋu.
It was very impressive	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ

It’s a good thing.	Enye nu nyui aɖe.
I still had that to look forward to	Ema gakpɔtɔ nɔ asinye si wòle be makpɔ mɔ na
I was going to call you	Menɔ ka ƒo ge na wò
Clearly, that work paid off.	Edze ƒã be dɔ ma ɖe vi.
We know who did it.	Míenya amesi wɔe.
That in itself is a great thing.	Ema ŋutɔ nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I already said what happened	Megblɔ nusi dzɔ xoxo
I know it’s not that easy.	Menya be mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
That does match the correct last name.	Ema sɔ kple ŋkɔ mamlɛtɔ si sɔ la nyateƒe.
I was able to ride the car several times	Mete ŋu do ʋua zi geɖe
I’ve never seen anything like it	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o
That’s not my concern.	Menye emae nye nusi ŋu metsi dzi ɖo o.
I had to make two rooms	Ele be mawɔ xɔ eve
You are here, he is there.	Èle afisia, ele afima.
Clearly, this is not true.	Edze ƒã be nya sia menye nyateƒe o.
His heart sank in his stomach.	Eƒe dzi dze eƒe dɔme.
There was no one in my room.	Ame aɖeke menɔ nye xɔ me o.
In fact, it is impossible.	Le nyateƒe me la, manya wɔ o.
These two are very interested in each other.	Ame eve siawo tsɔ ɖe le eme na wo nɔewo vevie.
I liked the way he was talking to me now	Ale si wònɔ nu ƒom nam fifia la dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
I put up with you for a long time	Medo dzi na wò ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe
It just can’t be you.	Ðeko mate ŋu anye wò o.
I can’t imagine what life would be like without you	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi agbe anɔ le susu me ne menye wòe o
I'm not quite sure what it is	Nyemeka ɖe nusi wònye dzi tututu o
I know that’s you.	Menya be wòe nye ema.
This actually happened to me.	Esia dzɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s not good money.	Ema menye ga nyui aɖeke o.
His back turned.	Eƒe megbe trɔ.
People will talk, you know.	Amewo aƒo nu, ènya.
But he didn’t want the money on him, either.	Gake medi be ga la nanɔ ye dzi o, nenema ke hã.
I am working on a new book	Mele dɔ wɔm tso agbalẽ yeye aɖe ŋu
There seems to be space and time.	Edze abe teƒe kple ɣeyiɣi li ene.
I met him right at my house	Medo go le nye aƒeme tututu
It’s part of that process.	Enye ɖoɖo ma ƒe akpa aɖe.
It was a small thing.	Nu sue aɖee wònye.
I will say some things about that here	Magblɔ nya aɖewo tso ema ŋu le afisia
Continue! 	Yi edzi!
I answered accordingly	Meɖo eŋu ɖe esia nu
I want my own thing, this thing	Medi nye ŋutɔ nye nya, nya sia
Let me tell you, he did a great job.	Mina magblɔ na mi be, ewɔ dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.

I shouldn’t have done anything different for this project	Mele be mawɔ nusi to vovo na dɔ sia hafi o
It’s obviously working.	Edze ƒã be ele dɔ wɔm.
I'll just stay a little longer.	Ðeko manɔ anyi vie.
I managed to get rid of my one gun	Mete ŋu ɖe nye tu ɖeka la ɖa
Now this is twice a week.	Fifia esia nye zi eve le kwasiɖa ɖeka me.
This just happened to me.	Ðeko esia dzɔ ɖe dzinye.
It was something after two.	Enye nane le eve megbe.
I haven’t seen you for the past two days	Nyemekpɔ wò o ŋkeke eve siwo va yi
I could literally talk about school all day	Mate ŋu aƒo nu tso suku ŋu ŋkeke bliboa ŋutɔŋutɔ
Just me, alone, again.	Nye ɖeka ko, nye ɖeka, ake.
Went very well.	Yi nyuie ŋutɔ.
In this life.	Le agbe sia me.
That is the reality.	Emae nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s the truth.	Emae nye nyateƒe.
But no one knew where they were.	Gake ame aɖeke menya afisi wole o.
That all happened in a matter of months.	Ema katã dzɔ le ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo ko me.
I had to tell them something	Ele nam be magblɔ nya aɖe na wo
Way too small.	Mɔ si le sue akpa.
Go to someone higher up.	Yi ame aɖe si kɔ wu gbɔ.
Some of them are obvious.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo dze ƒã.
This went on for years.	Esia yi edzi ƒe geɖe.
In some cases, this can be fatal.	Le go aɖewo me la, esia ate ŋu awu ame.
I wanted to do more but I was so tired	Medi be mawɔ geɖe wu gake ɖeɖi te ŋunye ŋutɔ
He couldn’t do anything for us.	Mete ŋu wɔ naneke na mí o.
They had a lot in common.	Nu geɖe nɔ wo dome si sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
His head was still down.	Eƒe ta gakpɔtɔ nɔ anyi.
I do have a small problem with that	Kuxi sue aɖe le ŋunye le ema ŋu ya
I really don’t want to know.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be manya o.
I went into my work with a new zeal	Metsɔ dzo yeye aɖe yi nye dɔa me
I grew up alone.	Nye ɖeka koe tsi va tsi.
I don’t know what to say to them	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ na wo o
I can’t remember exactly where it is right now	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku afi si tututu wòle dzi fifia o
I couldn’t control it	Nyemete ŋu ɖu edzi o
I think it always will be	Mesusu be anɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi
But he made a small mistake.	Gake ewɔ vodada sue aɖe.
I don’t have time to deal with you	Ɣeyiɣi mele asinye makpɔ wò gbɔ o
This would be a very good project.	Esia anye dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t control it.	Nyemete ŋu ɖu edzi o.
Like, really, really good.	Abe, nyateƒe, nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
There was something different this time, too.	Nane si to vovo nɔ anyi zi sia, hã.
There were no other cars nearby.	Ʋu bubu aɖeke menɔ afima si te ɖe afima ŋu o.
I know what it’s like	Menya alesi wòle
Still waiting for your name	Megale wò ŋkɔ lalam kokoko
I am trying to do this at home	Mele agbagba dzem be mawɔ esia le aƒeme
It will be a simple book.	Anye agbalẽ bɔbɔe aɖe.
I usually do this.	Zi geɖe la, mewɔa esia.
I used to wonder too	Tsã la, nye hã mebiaa ɖokuinye be
I tried to tell them that.	Medze agbagba be magblɔ nya ma na wo.
I have to be with someone who is mouthing off.	Ele be manɔ ame aɖe si le nu ƒom ɖe nu me la gbɔ.
I have a life to live.	Agbe aɖe le asinye manɔ.
I don’t know where we are	Nyemenya afi si míele o
They had no one else.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
I will stay here.	Manɔ afisia.
It was a great opportunity for him.	Enye mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe nɛ.
I can’t really say anything	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke ŋutɔŋutɔ o
No one had ever seen that face more than once.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ mo ma wu zi ɖeka kpɔ o.
I can’t call him though	Nyemate ŋu aƒo ka nɛ o ke hã
Which surprises me about you.	Nusi wɔ nuku nam le ŋuwò.
Quite the opposite.	Nusi to vovo kura na ema.
I honestly couldn’t live without it.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe ema manɔmee o.
I hope you can help me.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
I had to tell him the real truth	Ele nam be magblɔ nyateƒea ŋutɔŋutɔ nɛ
Anything is possible.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
An idea suddenly occurred to him	Susu aɖe va susu me nɛ zi ɖeka
I don’t feel that’s right	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be nya ma sɔ o
He didn’t know his name.	Menya eƒe ŋkɔ o.
I know what they want	Menya nusi dim wole
At this very moment.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia tututu me.
But he can’t do it.	Gake mate ŋui o.
I don’t think this is a good idea.	Nyemesusu be esia nye susu nyui aɖeke o.
Start with something simple.	Dze egɔme kple nu bɔbɔe aɖe.
I remember it as it was this morning	Meɖo ŋku edzi abe alesi wònɔ ŋdi sia ene
Perhaps no surprise there.	Ðewohĩ mewɔ nuku o le afima.
To some extent	Vaseɖe afi aɖe
He had no idea at this point.	Susu aɖeke menɔ esi le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
He hurried past her.	Ewɔ kaba to eŋu.
Come if you can.	Va ne àte ŋui.
Or, not what he wanted for his life.	Alo, menye nusi dim wònɔ na eƒe agbe o.
He didn't know what he was expecting.	Menya nusi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na o.
I found the perfect man for you.	Mekpɔ ŋutsu si sɔ nyuie na wò.
I have to stay.	Ele be manɔ anyi.
It didn’t work for me.	Mewɔ dɔ nam o.
I am usually alone here	Zi geɖe la, nye ɖeka koe nɔa afisia
You’re smarter than him now.	Wòe nye amesi dze aɖaŋu wu eya fifia.
I decided to do the exact opposite.	Meɖoe be mawɔ nusi to vovo kura na ema.
Clearly, this man knew very little.	Edze ƒã be nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe ŋutsu sia menya o.
I just don’t know who I am.	Ðeko nyemenya amesi nye o.
I have some interests	Nu aɖewo le asinye siwo metsɔ ɖe le
You can expose things.	Àte ŋu aɖe nuwo ɖe go.
His own work was more important.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe dɔa nɔ vevie wu.
I want to be there now	Medi be manɔ afima fifia
There is your tongue that wants something.	Wò aɖe li si di nane.
I might try something different this time	Ðewohĩ mate nu bubu aɖe kpɔ zi sia
We can try right here.	Míate ŋu ate kpɔ le afisia tututu.
Like, get them.	Abe, xɔ wo ɖe asi ene.
You just want to fight.	Ðeko nèdi be yeawɔ avu.
I encountered a couple of problems	Medo go kuxi eve aɖewo
I am still the same.	Megale nenema kokoko.
And that means either of two things happened.	Eye ema fia be nu eve dometɔ ɖesiaɖe dzɔ.
I had absolutely no idea what was going on.	Nyemenya nusi nɔ edzi yim kura o.
But now tell me something else.	Gake azɔ gblɔ nya bubu nam.
It was the only one I saw, the only one I heard, the only one I felt	Eya ɖeka koe mekpɔ, eya ɖeka koe mese, eya ɖeka koe mese le ɖokuinye me
Take a look at your home.	Lé ŋku ɖe wò aƒe ŋu.
I am working on it.	Mele dɔ wɔm le eŋu.

We are being fed here.	Wole nuɖuɖu nam mí le afisia.
But there is a debt for my help.	Gake fe aɖe le nye kpekpeɖeŋu ta.
He might have been one of them.	Ðewohĩ anye wo dometɔ ɖeka hafi.
I can’t do this alone	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔ esia o
I know the people closest to you have disappeared	Menya be ame siwo te ɖe ŋuwò wu la bu
But not now, though.	Gake menye fifia o.
I think that will always be in my mind	Mesusu be ema anɔ susu me nam ɣesiaɣi
I couldn’t put the alcohol down	Nyemete ŋu tsɔ aha la ƒu gbe o
I had never heard of him before this.	Nyemese eŋu nya kpɔ do ŋgɔ na esia o.

Some people can’t live in it.	Ame aɖewo mate ŋu anɔ agbe le eme o.
It was almost one in the morning.	Ŋdi ga ɖeka kloe.
That would be too easy.	Ema anɔ bɔbɔe akpa.

The issue wasn’t on me.	Nya la menɔ dzinye o.
I fell against him, hard.	Medze anyi ɖe eŋu, sesĩe.
I can’t stand you	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe ŋuwò o
I can’t be with anyone	Nyemate ŋu anɔ ame aɖeke gbɔ o
Not many people can do that.	Ame geɖe mate ŋu awɔ nu ma o.

It is very personal.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ ŋutɔ.

I know they will do well together.	Menya be woawɔ nu nyuie ɖekae.
I couldn’t get here at all	Nyemete ŋu ɖo afisia kura o
The results were positive.	Nu nyui aɖewo do tso eme.
I can’t imagine my life without them!	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nye agbe le susu me wo manɔmee o!
And that’s on top of it.	Eye ema ɖe edzi.
That’s something he should have done.	Ema nye nusi wòle be wòawɔ hafi.
It’s for everyone else.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe tae.
I didn’t see anyone or anything	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke alo naneke o
He had a great day ahead of him.	Ŋkeke gã aɖe nɔ ŋgɔ nɛ.
A man landed on it	Ŋutsu aɖe ɖi go ɖe edzi
The police conveniently disappeared.	Kpovitɔwo bu le mɔ si sɔ nu.
But this didn’t bother him.	Gake esia meɖe fu nɛ o.
I can’t say enough good things about it.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya nyui siwo sɔ tso eŋu o.
I relaxed anyway	Meɖe dzi ɖi le mɔ sia mɔ nu
It will probably do so.	Anɔ eme be awɔe nenema.
You have to fight a lot of problems.	Ele be nàwɔ avu kple kuxi geɖe.
There is nothing like this.	Naneke meli si le abe esia ene o.
Some things are too hard.	Nu aɖewo sesẽ akpa.
He had two dogs.	Avu eve nɔ esi.
We can’t do anything tonight.	Míate ŋu awɔ naneke le zã sia me o.
In fact, you can.	Le nyateƒe me la, àte ŋui.
There was a city like that	Du aɖe nɔ nenema

And it’s amazing.	Eye ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.

But things didn’t go well.	Gake nuwo meva yi nyuie o.

And that is quite different.	Eye ema to vovo kura.

Who knew it could be.	Amekae nya be ate ŋu anye nenema.
I needed to tell them very well	Ehiã be magblɔ nya na wo nyuie ŋutɔ
Ask them a question.	Bia nya aɖe wo.
I can usually find it	Zi geɖe la, mate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu
I was always worried	Metsi dzi ɣesiaɣi
I don’t see who started it.	Nyemekpɔ amesi dze egɔme o.
I actually saw him last night	Mekpɔ eya ŋutɔŋutɔ le zã si va yi me
I was just managing something, my everything	Ðeko menɔ nane dzi kpɔm, nye nusianu
He needed that.	Ehiã ema.
I was finally able to relax	Mete ŋu gbɔ ɖe eme mlɔeba
I remember something about that	Meɖo ŋku nane dzi le ema ŋu
He was really obsessed with money.	Ga ƒe susu nɔ eŋu vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.

I'll see you tomorrow afternoon	Makpɔ wò etsɔ ŋdɔ
A lot of things have changed.	Nu geɖe trɔ.

I want to say something, anything	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖe, nusianu
Find something to do with it.	Di nane si nàwɔ kplii.
He didn’t try to get close.	Mete kpɔ be yeate ɖe eŋu o.
I wanted to know about it too	Nye hã medi be manya nu tso eŋu
I was very impressed with him	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
He could not have been kinder to this little boy.	Anye ne mate ŋu anyo dɔme na ɖevi sue sia wu ema o.
There is something for everyone.	Nane li na amesiame.
I guess it hasn’t really hit me yet	Mesusu be medze dzinye ŋutɔŋutɔ haɖe o
This is a very important point.	Nya sia le vevie ŋutɔ.
I can’t control myself	Nyemate ŋu aɖu ɖokuinye dzi o
He will apologize to you.	Aɖe kuku na wò.
I almost threw myself at him	Metsɔ ɖokuinye ƒu gbe ɖe eŋu kloe
I think it’s important to me.	Mesusu be ele vevie nam.
You lost the job.	Dɔa ge le asiwò.
I can live without it.	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe ema manɔmee.
I want to be there when they ask questions	Medi be manɔ afima ne wole nya biam
I can’t remember it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi o.
Lower it down to the top.	Ðe anyi ɖe edzi.
I understand your work now	Mese wò dɔa gɔme fifia
And he was very attracted to her.	Eye eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
It was like he was two different people.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe wònye ame eve siwo to vovo ene.
That’s your path.	Emae nye wò mɔ.
I need to talk to you	Ele be maƒo nu kpli wò
Your dog will send over himself and you.	Wò avu aɖo ɖe eɖokui kple wò dzi.
Everybody will know everything about everybody.	Ame sia ame anya nu sia nu tso ame sia ame ŋu.
But there is something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã li.
I always hoped it would never come to this	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm ɣesiaɣi be mava ɖo esia gbɔ gbeɖe o
If not the most effective.	Ne menye nusi wɔa dɔ wu o la.
It is not anger	Menye dziku o .
I don’t think you know any word that has more than two words.	Nyemesusu be ènya nya aɖeke si me nya siwo wu eve le o.
I couldn’t force myself	Nyemete ŋu zi ɖokuinye dzi o
Maybe a week.	Ðewohĩ kwasiɖa ɖeka.
A few things caught his eye	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo lé eƒe ŋku
A difficult day.	Ŋkeke sesẽ aɖe.
It is a part of all of us.	Enye mí katã ƒe akpa aɖe.

I just can’t get close to it	Ðeko nyemate ŋu ate ɖe eŋu o
This is true in many cases.	Esia nye nyateƒe le nya geɖe me.

It happened to me.	Edzɔ ɖe dzinye.
This time, it worked.	Fifia ya, ewɔ dɔ.
I hope to see you there	Mele mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ wò le afima
I was the only one there.	Nye ɖeka koe wònɔ afima.
Some extra money comes with it.	Ga bubu aɖewo kpe ɖe eŋu.
There are two reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo li siwo tae.
Who is somehow lost.	Amekae bu le mɔ aɖe nu.
I just heard part of it.	Ðeko mese eƒe akpa aɖe.
It’s something anyone would do.	Enye nusi ame sia ame awɔ.
I didn’t know you liked them	Nyemenya be wo dzɔa dzi na wò o
You can't treat me like that.	Màte ŋu awɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋunye alea o.
I wasn’t alone	Menye nye ɖeka koe nɔ anyi o
You have to tell me what happened.	Ele be nàgblɔ nusi dzɔ la nam.
I can’t remember which one.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku esi dzi o.
A strong desire to be treated.	Didi vevie be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu.
That’s my point of doing the same thing.	Emae nye nye nya si nye nu ma ke wɔwɔ.
I think that’s pretty good	Mesusu be ema nyo ŋutɔ
I can almost see that one	Mete ŋu kpɔa ɖeka ma kloe
I never knew them either.	Nye hã nyemenya wo kpɔ o.
We are just people.	Amewo koe míenye.
I just can’t deal with it right now	Ðeko nyemete ŋu le nu wɔm kplii fifia o
I hope it's not too much	Mele mɔ kpɔm be menye nusi gbɔ eme o
We just don’t know you.	Ðeko míenya wò o.
Let me know if you have any questions.	Na manya ne nya aɖe le asiwò.
I had no other books	Agbalẽ bubu aɖeke menɔ asinye o
Some people are angry.	Ame aɖewo doa dziku.
No one knows anything.	Ame aɖeke menya naneke o.
I heard your name.	Mese wò ŋkɔ.
I was worried he might call someone or do something	Metsi dzi be ɖewohĩ aƒo ka na ame aɖe alo awɔ nane
I can easily do it for you	Mate ŋu awɔe na wò bɔbɔe
I was getting very angry	Menɔ dziku dom vevie ŋutɔ
I don’t know where these ideas come from	Nyemenya afi si susu siawo tso o
I think you have good stuff.	Mesusu be nu nyui le asiwò.
I can’t stay mad at him	Nyemate ŋu anɔ dziku dom ɖe eŋu o
I didn’t like this situation	Nɔnɔme sia medze ŋunye o
I sat and waited.	Menɔ anyi nɔ lalam.
I know what he can do	Menya nusi wòate ŋu awɔ
I got water.	Mekpɔ tsi.
Something else entirely.	Nu bubu aɖe kura.
I'm really having trouble with this part in my work.	Me le kuxi me ŋutɔŋutɔ le akpa sia ŋu le nye dɔa me.
He has done a lot in his life.	Ewɔ nu geɖe le eƒe agbe me.
It was not at all what he expected.	Menɔ abe alesi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ ene kura o.
He could try that.	Ate ŋu ate ema kpɔ.
I found it myself	Nye ŋutɔ meke ɖe eŋu
There is no section.	Akpa aɖeke meli o.
Anger was very angry	Dziku do dziku vevie ŋutɔ
I was just very disturbed.	Ðeko meɖe fu nam ŋutɔ.
This is different.	Esia to vovo.
My life was here.	Nye agbe nɔ afisia.
Your job is done.	Wò dɔa wu enu.
A voice spoke to him	Gbe aɖe ƒo nu nɛ
I'll be there soon now.	Mava afima kpuie fifia.
But you never know what’s going to happen.	Gake mènya nusi ava dzɔ gbeɖe o.
He couldn’t find it.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
I do something for him, maybe	Mewɔa nane nɛ, ɖewohĩ
That’s something you’ll never have.	Ema nye nusi manɔ asiwò gbeɖe o.
I knew what he was doing	Menya nusi wɔm wònɔ
I know how to reach them	Menya alesi mawɔ aɖo wo gbɔ
Take the money.	Xɔ ga la.
I know what’s good for me	Menya nu si nyo nam
I think he is going to win more.	Mesusu be ele dzi ɖu ge geɖe wu.
This year is no exception	Ƒe sia hã mele eme o
I’m surprised he didn’t already know	Ewɔ nuku nam be menya xoxo o
But there is something different.	Gake nane li si to vovo.
I let you have your say.	Meɖe mɔ na wò be nàgblɔ wò nya.
However, the reality is different.	Ke hã, nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si le eme la to vovo.
I told him the same thing	Megblɔ nya ma ke nɛ hã
He started to move forward.	Edze egɔme yi ŋgɔ.
Any idea will help.	Susu ɖesiaɖe aɖe akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
It was actually a really good day for him.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye ŋkeke nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ nɛ.
I think that’s important.	Mesusu be ema le vevie.
It couldn’t have been easy for him, but he tried.	Mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe nɛ hafi o, gake edze agbagba.
A new problem arose	Kuxi yeye aɖe do mo ɖa
It’s amazing what a little blood will do.	Nusi ʋu vi aɖe awɔ la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I would like to talk to him as well.	Madi be maƒo nu kplii hã.
I hope everything went well	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nusianu yi edzi nyuie
I know how they are	Menya alesi wole
Maybe that’s what you’re looking for.	Ðewohĩ emae nye nusi dim nèle.
This is now over.	Esia wu enu azɔ.
It makes perfect sense.	Susu le eme kura.
If it works.	Ne ewɔ dɔ.
I can’t talk about it now	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu tso eŋu fifia o
It didn’t do anything for me.	Mewɔ naneke nam o.
I am a person who focuses on all aspects of life.	Nyee nye ame si ƒe susu nɔa agbe ƒe akpa sia akpa ŋu.
I knew what was going on I was conscious.	Menya nusi nɔ edzi yim la ƒe susu nɔ ŋunye.
This can be very useful for a number of reasons.	Esia ate ŋu aɖe vi ŋutɔ le susu geɖe ta.
I now know he will want this for me	Menya azɔ be adi esia nam
The next day.	Ŋkeke si gbɔna.
It’s probably a good one.	Anɔ eme be enye ɖeka nyui aɖe.
I resigned after only a few months	Meɖe asi le dɔ ŋu le ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo ko megbe
It seems so obvious now.	Edze abe edze ƒã ale gbegbe fifia ene.
Things are very difficult in my house.	Nuwo sesẽ ŋutɔ le nye aƒeme.
I don’t think that’s impossible.	Nyemesusu be manya wɔ be woawɔ nenema o.
Now on to the really important part.	Azɔ yi akpa si le vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ la gbɔ.
He was so clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ale gbegbe.
He can’t escape it.	Mate ŋu asi le enu o.
It didn’t work out too well.	Mewɔ dɔ nyuie akpa o.
I don’t know, man.	Nyemenya o, ŋutsu.
I still had work to do	Dɔ gakpɔtɔ nɔ asinye mawɔ
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It was another dog there.	Avu bubu aɖee wònye le afima.
It’s nothing to me one way or another.	Menye naneke nam le mɔ aɖe nu alo le mɔ bubu nu o.
It doesn’t work very often.	Mewɔa dɔ zi geɖe o.
I lead it all	Nyee xɔa ŋgɔ le wo katã me
I can get pregnant	Mate ŋu afɔ fu
He had been through a harsh winter.	Dzomeŋɔli sesẽ aɖe to edzi kpɔ.
A good idea came to him	Susu nyui aɖe va dze edzi nɛ
That would have been a long time ago.	Ema anye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia hafi.
He is going to reveal this.	Ele esia ɖe ge ɖe go.
We can.	Míate ŋu.
You’re just like me.	Èle abe nye ene.
I refused and said he could	Megbe eye megblɔ be ate ŋui
I couldn’t find him, he couldn’t find me	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o, eya hã mete ŋu ke ɖe ŋunye o
There are some problems.	Kuxi aɖewo li.
He just couldn’t.	Ðeko mete ŋui o.
He didn’t believe me.	Mexɔ dzinye se o.
I know this first hand	Menya asi gbãtɔ sia
It’s not the right thing to do.	Menye nusi sɔ o.
I remembered them all	Meɖo ŋku wo katã dzi
I felt very little.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nu sue aɖe koe mese le ɖokuinye me.
I don’t want to be in school	Nyemedi be manɔ suku o
You can go.	Àte ŋu ayi.
Still, the point is valid.	Ke hã, nya la sɔ.
It will be there.	Anɔ afima.
This will take some days.	Esia axɔ ŋkeke aɖewo.
You can never escape this.	Màte ŋu asi le esia nu gbeɖe o.
I guess that means you probably can too.	Mesusu be ema fia be ɖewohĩ wò hã àte ŋu awɔe.
I liked him before that	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam do ŋgɔ na ema
I was really looking forward to it	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ
He will know what to do.	Anya nusi wòawɔ.

There was a job involved.	Dɔ aɖe nɔ eme.
They are in them.	Wole wo me.
I will be here with him	Manɔ afisia kplii
I had my own gun there.	Nye ŋutɔ nye tu nɔ asinye le afima.
That’s the whole problem.	Emae nye kuxi bliboa.
I put my hand over her mouth	Metsɔ nye asi da ɖe eƒe nu dzi
I came to a halt, stood still for a moment	Meva tɔ ɖe teƒe aɖe, metsi tre ɖe teƒe ɖeka vie
I don’t know how to help her.	Nyemenya ale si mawɔ akpe ɖe eŋu o.
I have to find someone	Ele be madi ame aɖe
I touched it with my hand.	Metsɔ nye asi ka asi eŋu.
I said get inside.	Megblɔ be ge ɖe eme.
Not much more than that.	Menye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema boo o.
Something with some real life.	Nane si me agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖewo le.
I know him and his work better than anyone	Menya eya kple eƒe dɔa nyuie wu ame sia ame
That’s the first thing that surprised you, you know.	Emae nye nu gbãtɔ si wɔ nuku na wò, ènya.

I used to have a voice too	Gbe aɖe nɔ nye hã ŋunye tsã

Couldn't find one or anything.	Mete ŋu kpɔ ɖeka alo naneke o.

No one worked as hard as he did.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ dɔ sesĩe abe eya ene o.

They have no children.	Vi mele wo si o.
I can still get you out of here.	Mate ŋu aɖe wò le afisia kokoko.
I know what he can do	Menya nu si wòate ŋu awɔ
I didn’t intend to do that	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔ nu ma o
He has had a job.	Dɔ le esi kpɔ.

We’ve been here a long time.	Míele afisia ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.

But look at it.	Gake lé ŋku ɖe eŋu.
I know one of the people working there	Menya ame siwo le dɔ wɔm le afima la dometɔ ɖeka
I couldn’t have hoped for a better teacher	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ mɔ na nufiala si nyo wu o
That in itself is not very surprising.	Ema ŋutɔ menye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ o.
I have reason to do it now.	Susu le asinye be mawɔe fifia.
Someone called last night.	Ame aɖe ƒo ka le zã si va yi me.
I was doing pretty well on my own	Menɔ edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔ le ɖokuinye si
I just wondered, that’s all	Ðeko mebia ɖokuinye be, ema koe nye ema
I think that’s a good thing.	Mesusu be nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
The people there could not get any food or clean water	Ame siwo le afi ma mete ŋu kpɔ nuɖuɖu alo tsi nyui aɖeke o
I had heard his name, he had heard mine.	Mese eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ, eya hã se nye ŋkɔ kpɔ.
Or maybe there was more to it than that.	Alo ɖewohĩ nu geɖe nɔ eme wu ema.
What he could and couldn’t do.	Nusi wòate ŋu awɔ kple nusi mete ŋu wɔ o.
This is a new phenomenon.	Esia nye nu yeye aɖe.
This could be his job in a few weeks.	Esia ate ŋu anye eƒe dɔa le kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo megbe.
That actually works better for me.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema wɔa dɔ nam nyuie wu.
I just want to know what happened to him	Ðeko medi be manya nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi
Something more than that.	Nane si wu nenema.
Everything gets a little overwhelming	Nusianu xɔa dzinye vie
I couldn’t escape that place	Nyemete ŋu si le teƒe ma o
I couldn’t help it, but I liked it	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o, gake eƒe nu lé dzi nam
Like he didn’t touch her.	Abe alesi meka asi eŋu o ene.
I just didn’t expect to meet anyone else like me	Ðeko nyemekpɔ mɔ be mado go ame bubu aɖeke abe nye ene o
When things get bad enough, you know he’s there.	Ne nuwo gblẽ ale gbegbe la, ènya be ele afima.
I really enjoyed this part	Akpa sia do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
I just can’t get this scenario out of my head.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖe nɔnɔme sia ɖa le nye ta me o.
Me and you.	Nye kple wò.
I was going to take the lead.	Nyee nɔ ŋgɔ xɔ ge.
Inside, people were praying.	Le eme la, amewo nɔ gbe dom ɖa.
Great location for your lake home.	Teƒe nyui aɖe na wò ta me aƒe.
He couldn't remember exactly what.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku nusi dzi tututu o.
I hope it works for you!	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ na wò!
Just a personal aside.	Ame ŋutɔ ƒe nya aɖe ko ɖe vovo.
I only met them a few times	Zi ʋɛ aɖewo koe medo go wo
I survived.	Metsi agbe.
I didn’t have a job yet	Dɔ aɖeke menɔ asinye haɖe o
I wanted to sit down and talk to him	Medi be manɔ anyi aƒo nu kplii
He didn’t deny this.	Megbe nya sia o.
But there were other relevant factors.	Gake nu bubu siwo sɔ hã nɔ anyi.
Many of them laughed.	Wo dometɔ geɖe ko nu.
I would love to be able to voice my opinion.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mate ŋu agblɔ nye susu.
He was another man.	Ŋutsu bubu aɖee wònye.
Maybe it will help you.	Ðewohĩ akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I wondered what would excite him	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae ado dzidzɔ nɛ hã
They are doing a lot wrong.	Wole nu geɖe wɔm le mɔ gbegblẽ nu.
I hope they are all well and happy	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wo katã wole nyuie eye wole dzidzɔ kpɔm
There was no water and no water which meant no breakfast.	Tsi menɔ anyi o eye tsi aɖeke meli si fia be ŋdi nuɖuɖu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
That is the truth of it.	Emae nye nyateƒe si le eme.
But that night something changed.	Gake le zã ma me la, nane trɔ.
I was like holding them in my hands	Menɔ abe ɖe metsɔ asi lé wo ɖe asi ene
This is a different situation, of course.	Esia nye nɔnɔme bubu ya.

I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I went out to find you.	Medo go be madi wò.
That is the truth.	Emae nye nyateƒea.
It was his first major project	Enye eƒe dɔ gã gbãtɔ
He would need to do that much.	Ahiã be wòawɔ nu ma gbegbe.
I'm pretty sure no one knows much about it	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ be ame aɖeke menya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o

Not in that order.	Menye ɖe ɖoɖo ma nu o.

There’s also a money component.	Azɔ hã, ga ƒe akpa aɖe hã li.
I can do better than that	Mate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu ema
Get closer to it.	Te ɖe eŋu.
I really, really did.	Mewɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And it’s the first one	Eye wònye gbãtɔ
Someone will hear that.	Ame aɖe ase nya ma.
I shouldn’t have done that	Mele be mawɔ nu ma hafi o
I wonder why he was here	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae wònɔ afisia hã
I’ve already said I’m sorry	Megblɔ xoxo be meɖe kuku
I was shocked to hear what had happened	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ esi mese nusi dzɔ
I will save them this time	Maɖe wo zi sia
I need to stay here a little longer	Ele be manɔ afisia ɣeyiɣi didi vie
I've treated you a little bit	Mewɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋuwò vie
I know many of them well	Menya wo dometɔ geɖe nyuie
I understand you have to do what you have to do.	Mese egɔme be ele be nàwɔ nusi wòle be nàwɔ.
I can be of no use here	Nyemate ŋu aɖe vi aɖeke le afisia o
I put on a hard face	Medo mo sesẽ aɖe
I know exactly what this is about	Menya nusi tututu ŋu nya sia ku ɖo
It was too soon.	Enye kaba akpa.
They’re getting angry.	Wole dziku dom.
Start with a simple idea.	Dze egɔme kple susu bɔbɔe aɖe.
I think that’s you.	Mesusu be wòe nye ema.
But they have one thing in common.	Gake nu ɖeka aɖe le wo si.
I was wrong about that.	Mewɔ vodada le nya ma ŋu.
But that seems unlikely now.	Gake edze abe ema mate ŋu adzɔ fifia o ene.
I couldn't find much about it.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe nu geɖe ŋu tso eŋu o.
I told you they were on their way	Megblɔ na mi be wole mɔ dzi
I don’t know, maybe it will take more time.	Nyemenya o, ɖewohĩ axɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu.
No problems so far.	Kuxi aɖeke meli vaseɖe fifia o.
He had never seen more than they did.	Mekpɔ nu wu wo kpɔ o.
One eye lifted up.	Ŋku ɖeka kɔ ɖe dzi.
In fact, he wasn’t going to head.	Le nyateƒe me la, menɔ ta yim o.
But I didn’t get too close.	Gake nyemete ɖe eŋu akpa o.
I suggest everyone do the same	Meɖo aɖaŋu be amesiame nawɔ nenema ke
I really don’t want to go	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be mayi o
That could end up eating us up.	Ema ate ŋu ava ɖu mí mlɔeba.
I was just so worried	Ðeko metsi dzi ale gbegbe
Add more water, if needed.	Tsɔ tsi bubu kpe ɖe eŋu, ne ehiã.
I shouldn’t be here at all, really	Mele be manɔ afisia kura o, le nyateƒe me
Everything is different now.	Nusianu to vovo fifia.
You are something completely different.	Ènye nane si to vovo kura.
I just couldn’t let go	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ɖe asi le eŋu o
And maybe he was, too.	Eye ɖewohĩ eya hã nɔ nenema.
I shouldn’t have done anything at all	Mele be mawɔ naneke kura hafi o
I think you might like it	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ adzɔ dzi na wò
I know that was the general thought	Menya be emae nye susu si nɔ amewo katã si
I wondered where that would go	Mebia ɖokuinye be afikae ema ayi ɖo hã
I couldn’t prove anything	Nyemete ŋu ɖo kpe naneke dzi o
Get into his head.	Ge ɖe eƒe ta me.
Maybe he can.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋui.
I didn’t see you there	Nyemekpɔ wò le afima o
In a way, it’s actually there.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, ele afima ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But not like me.	Gake menye abe nye ene o.
That makes no sense.	Susu aɖeke mele nya ma me o.
He said nothing about anyone in this case.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke tso ame aɖeke ŋu le nya sia me o.
Almost anything will work.	Nusianu kloe awɔ dɔ.
And now everything has happened.	Eye fifia nusianu va dzɔ.
But it’s not surprising.	Gake mewɔ nuku o.
I wasn’t happy about this.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe esia ŋu o.
Everything will be fine.	Nusianu anɔ nyuie.
It was very personal.	Enye nusi nye eya ŋutɔ tɔ ŋutɔ.
That’s like money.	Ema sɔ kple ga.
We can’t answer ‘yesterday’.	Míate ŋu aɖo eŋu nɛ be ‘etsɔ’ o.
' MY !.	' NYE !.
The whole book.	Agbalẽ bliboa katã.
I want someone else to work with him	Medi be ame bubu nawɔ dɔ kplii
Like himself.	Abe eya ŋutɔ ene.
It is slightly different in both shape and layout.	Eƒe nɔnɔme to vovo vie le eƒe nɔnɔme kple ɖoɖo siaa me.
None of them were active yet.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ dɔ dzi haɖe o.
Sit down with it.	Nɔ anyi ɖe eŋu.
I can’t do that to him	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma ɖe eŋu o
I came to the same conclusion	Meva ƒo nya ta nenema ke
Yours is beautiful.	Wò tɔ nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
I want to make a mistake	Medi be mawɔ vodada

I know you can understand	Menya be àte ŋu ase egɔme
She was too cute to talk to him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ akpa be wòate ŋu aƒo nu kplii.
There was some kind of problem.	Kuxi aɖe ƒomevi nɔ eme.
I wanted to surprise him.	Medi be mawɔ nuku nɛ.
But it doesn’t matter.	Gake mehiã o.
I think that would be great	Mesusu be ema anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ
The night was hot.	Zã la xɔ dzo.
I know you’re fine	Menya be èle nyuie
We can do it.	Míate ŋu awɔe.
I was very interested in it.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme ŋutɔ.
I think it might come soon.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ava kpuie.
I’m glad I’m alive	Edzɔ dzi nam be mele agbe
I know my relatively commodious house well	Menya nye aƒe si me nu geɖe le vie la nyuie
That everything came from nothing.	Be nusianu tso naneke me o.
I must apologize for making an assumption	Ele be maɖe kuku le esi mewɔ susu aɖe ta
It really is that simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe.
I just need to find out who it is	Ðeko wòle be madi amesi nye
I wish more people would do this.	Medi be ame geɖe wu nawɔ esia.
I was a little nervous	Metsi dzodzodzoe vie
I don’t know where he is	Nyemenya afi si wòle o
I didn’t think it would be but it really is	Nyemesusu be anɔ nenema o gake ele nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ
None of us did that.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
No room is needed.	Xɔ aɖeke mehiã o.
Throughout the year.	Le ƒe bliboa me.
I was worried about it	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu
He didn’t come this time.	Meva zi sia o.
Better.	Nyo wu.
I gave them to the police	Metsɔ wo na kpovitɔwo
I think he needs some time	Mesusu be ehiã ɣeyiɣi aɖe
I am not short at all	Nyemele kpuie kura o
I couldn’t be happier	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ wu ema o
But he liked her in that.	Gake eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ le nya ma me.
He was satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme.
No one can take that away.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ ema le ame si o.
There is no one here.	Ame aɖeke mele afisia o.
I’m not sure it’s true	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be enye nyateƒe o
He’s interested in it.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme.
Someone wrote this a long time ago.	Ame aɖe ŋlɔ nya sia ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I know exactly what will happen	Menya nusi tututu adzɔ
None of them can let go.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu o.
I really should know	Ele be manya ŋutɔŋutɔ
I don’t know what it is, exactly.	Nyemenya nusi wònye o, tututu.
Keep it up !.	Yi edzi nenema !.
He planned this for months.	Ewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe esia ŋu ɣleti geɖe.
I understood what he was doing	Mese nu si wɔm wònɔ la gɔme
Or maybe he is in the house.	Alo ɖewohĩ ele aƒea me.
I want you, you want me	Medi wò, wò hã nèdi nye
I couldn’t understand it	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme o
Something needs to be done about that	Ele be woawɔ nane tso ema ŋu
I listened carefully	Meɖo to nyuie
A time to be treated as an independent person.	Ɣeyiɣi si woawɔ nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu abe ame si le eɖokui si ene.
In many cases, you have to do the work.	Le go geɖe me la, ele be nàwɔ dɔa.
Can't take anything more.	Mate ŋu axɔ naneke wu ema o.
It could still happen to me.	Ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe dzinye kokoko.
Can't eat any of them now.	Mate ŋu aɖu wo dometɔ aɖeke fifia o.
A very great idea.	Susu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I like that too.	Ema hã dzɔa dzi nam.
Use the word you.	Zã nya si nye wò.
I want to live my own life	Medi be manɔ nye ŋutɔ nye agbe me
He had never been sick.	Medze dɔ kpɔ o.
I know exactly what they had in mind	Menya nu si tututu nɔ susu me na wo
I know you have some anger	Menya be dziku aɖe le ŋuwò
I would have done that, if it was me	Anye ne mewɔe nenema, nenye nyee
I don’t need to tell you that	Mehiã be magblɔ nya ma na mi o
I can make you one better	Mate ŋu awɔ ɖeka na wò nyuie wu
Good night.	Dɔ agbe.
Imagine what this would have been like.	Bu ale si esia anɔ hafi ŋu kpɔ.
But it wasn’t easy for them.	Gake menɔ bɔbɔe na wo o.
Treat him as he is.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu abe alesi wòle ene.
It was nothing of the sort, of course.	Menye naneke si ƒomevi wònye o ya.
I know you have to do this alone	Menya be ele be wò ɖeka nàwɔ esia
I had to do two jobs.	Ele nam be mawɔ dɔ eve.
He deserves a good man.	Edze na ame nyui aɖe.
I would love to have pieces of it	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be eƒe akpa aɖewo nanɔ asinye
I think they’re going to do it a little soon	Mesusu be wole ewɔ ge kpuie vie
However, only a few people do.	Ke hã, ame aɖewo koe wɔa esia.
I knew there was a man	Menya be ŋutsu aɖe li
He was also a good man.	Enye ame nyui aɖe hã.
I was a little surprised	Mewɔ nuku nam vie
I really like that about you	Ema dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ le ŋuwò
Everyone in that room died.	Amesiame si nɔ xɔ ma me ku.
I knew something had happened	Menya be nane dzɔ
A small private apartment.	Xɔ sue aɖe si nye eya ŋutɔ tɔ.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I heard about it this morning	Mese nu tso eŋu ŋdi sia
He looked like himself.	Edze abe eya ŋutɔ ene.
It was just very hard work.	Dɔ sesẽ ŋutɔ koe wònye.
I looked a little more respectable	Medze abe ame si ŋu bubu le vie wu ene
They are very excited.	Dzi dzɔa wo ŋutɔ.
Finally, he couldn’t stand it.	Mlɔeba la, mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
It’s a bad thing, you know.	Enye nu gbegblẽ aɖe, ènya.
I found two traps	Meke ɖe mɔ̃ eve ŋu
I got there too late	Meɖo afima tsi megbe akpa
Which is pretty amazing.	Nusi nye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It was a dog.	Enye avu aɖe.
There used to be a fort here.	Tsã la, mɔ̃ sesẽ aɖe nɔ afisia.
I wasn’t that impressed	Mewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye nenema gbegbe o
This will be over.	Esia awu enu.
But this time is different.	Gake ɣeyiɣi sia ya to vovo.
I have an idea that you might like.	Susu aɖe le asinye si ɖewohĩ adzɔ dzi na wò.
A man who wants to find his way home	Ŋutsu aɖe si di be yeakpɔ mɔ ayi aƒeme
I feel like you know this.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ènya esia.
I was able to calm him down.	Mete ŋu na eƒe dzi dze eme.
I made my way in that direction	Mewɔ nye mɔ yi mɔ ma dzi
I have more than one wish	Didi siwo wu ɖeka le asinye
Two people are missing.	Ame eve bu.
You can’t see anything.	Màte ŋu akpɔ naneke o.
I said it doesn’t matter anyway	Megblɔ be mehiã o le mɔ sia mɔ nu
They are all in the market.	Wo katã le asi me.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I hope it’s not my head	Mele mɔ kpɔm be menye nye tae o
That’s probably enough for now.	Anɔ eme be ema sɔ gbɔ na fifia.
Report what happened the night before.	Ka nya ta tso nusi dzɔ le zã si do ŋgɔ me ŋu.
I don’t want to know if he’s serious	Nyemedi be manya nenye be etsɔ ɖe le eme vevie o
The first to fall.	Gbãtɔ si dze anyi.
I don’t know what hit me	Nyemenya nusi ƒo ɖe dzinye o
It was a lot of fun for us.	Enye dzidzɔ na mí ŋutɔ.
I have the same problem	Kuxi ma ke le ŋunye
That helped, too.	Ema hã kpe ɖe eŋu.
I think there might be someone else	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ame bubu aɖe hã li
Everyone saw what happened.	Amesiame kpɔ nusi dzɔ.
I really wanted to do that	Medi vevie be mawɔe nenema
I know the gun.	Menya tu la.
Not there tonight.	Menye afima le zã sia me o.
It’s that kind of life now.	Enye agbe ma ƒomevi fifia.
Not so impossible.	Menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o nenema gbegbe o.
Someone we can live with	Ame si míate ŋu anɔ agbe kplii
I stated the obvious	Megblɔ nusi dze ƒã
I could feel that summer was coming	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me be dzomeŋɔli gbɔna
Think about what you want to do.	Bu nusi nèdi be yeawɔ ŋu.
I still can’t let you go.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le ŋuwò kokoko o.
Whatever they liked.	Nusianu si dze wo ŋu.
And over and over again.	Eye zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I don’t have time for that.	Ɣeyiɣi mele asinye na ema o.
It's a bit surreal though.	Enye nusi me susu mele o vie ke hã.
I could see another one behind him	Mete ŋu kpɔ bubu le megbe nɛ
I was late but look.	Metsi megbe gake kpɔ ɖa.
But he didn’t fight it.	Gake mewɔ avu kplii o.
A warm heart and a clear head.	Dzi si me dzo le kple ta si me kɔ.
In fact, he couldn't be surprised.	Le nyateƒe me la, mate ŋu awɔ nuku nɛ o.
I wanted my house.	Medi nye aƒe.
I don’t know at all	Nyemenya kura o
So many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe ale gbegbe.
I'm right there with you, man.	Mele afima tututu kpli wò, ŋutsu.
I think that’s a good thing	Mesusu be nu nyui aɖee nye ema
I don’t know what that is	Nyemenya nusi ema nye o
I knew it would never work	Menya be mawɔ dɔ gbeɖe o
I can’t help you with this	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò le esia me o
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
I would have found out about it	Anye ne meva nya nu tso eŋu
I think it’s a possibility	Mesusu be enye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ
I definitely had more fun doing this.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ wu le esia wɔwɔ me godoo.
He wasn’t fighting.	Menye ɖe wònɔ avu wɔm o.
There are two reasons why this proved impossible.	Susu eve aɖewo tae esia meva eme be manya wɔ o.
I want to talk to this guy	Medi be maƒo nu kple ŋutsu sia
Part of it, anyway	Eƒe akpa aɖe, le mɔ sia mɔ nu
Now we will do something you want to do.	Azɔ míawɔ nane si nèdi be yeawɔ.
You have a way with it.	Mɔ aɖe le asiwò kplii.
I want to see that.	Medi be makpɔ ema.
I don’t know anyone else quite that well	Nyemenya ame bubu aɖeke nyuie nenema tututu o
Go on, hate us.	Yi edzi, lé fu mí.
I just felt like everything was over	Ðeko mese le ɖokuinye me abe ɖe nusianu wu enu ene
He looked tired and exhausted.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu eye ɖeɖi te eŋu ene.
As things stand now, that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Abe alesi nuwo le fifia ene la, edze abe mele nenema o ene.
But everything is fine.	Gake nusianu le nyuie.
At least some people.	Ame aɖewo ya teti.
I can’t find another word for it	Nyemekpɔ nya bubu aɖeke na esia o
But we have a job to do.	Gake dɔ aɖe le mía si míawɔ.
Or, actually, the opposite.	Alo, le nyateƒe me la, nusi tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
I seem to have done everything right too	Edze abe nye hã mewɔ nusianu nyuie ene
I should be able to happen though	Ele be mate ŋu adzɔ gake
I quickly glanced around the room	Meɖe ŋku ɖe xɔa me ŋu kaba
I’m so glad I met people like you	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go amewo abe wò ene
Man, he can’t go home right now.	Ŋutsu, mate ŋu ayi aƒeme fifia o.
This way, this way.	Mɔ sia dzi, mɔ sia dzi.
Or talk about his food.	Alo ƒo nu tso eƒe nuɖuɖu ŋu.
It didn’t surprise me.	Mewɔ nuku nam o.
He seems smart enough for that now.	Edze abe edze aɖaŋu ale gbegbe na ema fifia ene.
Find us a house.	Di xɔ na mí.
I'm stuck with this.	Me ku ɖe nya sia ŋu.
I promised him.	Medo ŋugbe nɛ.
Because it is, it is here.	Esi wònye ta la, ele afisia.
We don’t know what’s going on.	Míenya nusi le edzi yim o.
Something similar to this.	Nane si sɔ kple esia.
I had a car within a month	Ʋu va nɔ asinye le ɣleti ɖeka me
There are some very good ones.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo li siwo nyo ŋutɔ.
There wasn’t much we could do about it.	Nu geɖe aɖeke menɔ anyi si míate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu o.
Something very small.	Nane si le sue ŋutɔ.
That could reasonably be true.	Ema ate ŋu anye nyateƒe le susu me.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t be happier, really	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ wu ema o, le nyateƒe me
It’s private now.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ fifia.
You have to, you have to do as you please.	Ele be wò ya, ele be nàwɔ alesi nèdi.
But the building is obviously not that old.	Gake edze ƒã be xɔa mexɔ xoxo nenema gbegbe o.
None of them started.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke medze egɔme o.
I did get the money	Mexɔ ga la nyateƒe
But it was faster.	Gake ewɔ kaba wu.
Yet he didn’t know exactly what that was.	Ke hã menya nusi tututu ema nye o.
I was very impressed to be there.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ be menɔ afima.
Two of them were on duty.	Wo dometɔ eve nɔ dɔ dzi.
I need someone to help me with them	Mehiã ame aɖe si akpe ɖe ŋunye le wo ŋu
There won’t be much of anything.	Ado geɖe le naneke ŋu o.
This seems unlikely.	Esia dze abe ɖe mele eme o ene.
I looked like a completely new person.	Medze abe ame yeye kura ene.
I couldn’t stay there	Nyemete ŋu nɔ afima o
Too much time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe akpa.
I would like to know more.	Madi be manya nu geɖe wu.
I thought the meeting would never end	Mesusu be kpekpea nu mayi gbeɖe o
I just want to know how it is	Ðeko medi be manya alesi wòle
That’s what you are.	Wòe nye ema.
It’s a weird kind of good thing.	Enye nu nyui ƒomevi aɖe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I think we are depressed	Mesusu be nu te ɖe mía dzi
I would like to, though.	Madi be mawɔe, gake.
I'm not sure what reason he could have	Nyemeka ɖe susu si ate ŋu anɔ esi dzi o
It seemed small.	Edze abe ɖe wòle sue ene.
I think you can do it.	Mesusu be àte ŋui.
Make food for them.	Wɔ nuɖuɖu na wo.
He didn’t have that quality anywhere.	Nɔnɔme ma menɔ esi le afi aɖeke o.
And they are actively working on them now.	Eye wole dɔ wɔm vevie le wo ŋu fifia.
I really enjoyed the attention	Alesi amewo lé ŋku ɖe nu ŋui la do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
Or maybe it will be.	Alo ɖewohĩ anɔ nenema.
I know it’s hard.	Menya be eƒe sesẽ.
No one else did either.	Ame bubu aɖeke hã mewɔe nenema o.
It's death.	Enye ku.
But that issue came up.	Gake nya ma va do mo ɖa.
I had no idea things were so bad	Nyemenya kura be nuwo gblẽ alea gbegbe o
I have time on my hands	Ɣeyiɣi le asinye
I have seen many of them.	Mekpɔ wo dometɔ geɖe.

Everyone is on it.	Amesiame le edzi.
There is a job to be done.	Dɔ aɖe li woawɔ.

Maybe a little better.	Ðewohĩ anyo wu vie.
I must emphasize here	Ele be mate gbe ɖe edzi le afisia
I’ve taken care of it before	Mekpɔ edzi do ŋgɔ
A few people came there	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo va afima
Maybe he can help her.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu.
A little here, a little there.	Vi aɖe le afisia, vie le afima.
In good condition.	Le nɔnɔme nyui me.

I didn’t know what to wear	Nyemenya nusi mado o
I look forward to that!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na ema!.
But this didn’t happen.	Gake esia mete ŋu dzɔ o.

It’s a pretty clear thing.	Enye nusi me kɔ nyuie.
I didn’t see what it was	Nyemekpɔ nusi wònye o
This was important.	Esia nɔ vevie.
I took everything with me.	Metsɔ nusianu ɖe ​​asi.
I can’t do anything for them	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke na wo o
He had never heard a word.	Mese nya aɖeke kpɔ o.
I couldn’t have done it before.	Nyemate ŋui tsã o.
I struggled with myself	Mewɔ avu kple ɖokuinye
I can understand the logic	Mate ŋu ase susu si le eme la gɔme
Not after a while.	Menye le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe o.
That works great.	Ema wɔa dɔ ŋutɔ.
The matter went through completely.	Nya la to eme kura.
I suggest this morning will be good.	Meɖo aɖaŋu be ŋdi sia anyo.
By the work that still needs to be done.	To dɔ si wòle be woawɔ kokoko me.
I need space.	Mehiã teƒe.
I don’t know how to explain it to him	Nyemenya ale si maɖe eme nɛ o
However, maybe that’s just me.	Ke hã, ɖewohĩ nye koe nye ema.
I couldn’t see who it was	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ amesi wònye o
In fact, rarely.	Le nyateƒe me la, ƒã hafi.
I think it would be great.	Mesusu be anyo ŋutɔ.
This is similar to food tax.	Esia sɔ kple nuɖuɖu ƒe adzɔ.
This can work out as a very large debt.	Esia ate ŋu awɔ dɔ abe fe gã aɖe ŋutɔ ene.
I didn’t know what to expect	Nyemenya nusi makpɔ mɔ na o
I got a meal.	Mexɔ nuɖuɖu aɖe.

I think it could be useful	Mesusu be ate ŋu aɖe vi
I still felt it, and so did he.	Mese le ɖokuinye me kokoko, eye eya hã se le ɖokuinye me nenema ke.
Many people were on this	Ame geɖe nɔ esia dzi
There may be one or two people.	Ame ɖeka alo eve ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
He worked harder than ever.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe wu tsã.

I couldn’t talk to him	Nyemete ŋu ƒo nu kplii o

He was another man who was different.	Enye ŋutsu bubu si to vovo.
A man with a job is a good thing	Ŋutsu si si dɔ le la nye nu nyui aɖe

I know he has a lot.	Menya be nu geɖe le esi.
He has a deeper reason.	Susu si de to wu le esi.
I asked where he was	Mebia afi si wòle hã
That is the most appropriate.	Emae nye esi sɔ wu.
That’s a thank you.	Ema nye akpe na wò.

Yet this is different.	Ke hã esia to vovo.

I can’t promise him anything either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu ado naneke ƒe ŋugbe nɛ o
Perhaps he felt the same way.	Ðewohĩ eya hã se le eɖokui me nenema.
I was already very sure but not sure who	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ xoxo gake nyemeka ɖe amesi nye dzi o
I believe in it.	Mexɔ edzi se.
And he’s not the only one.	Eye menye eya ɖeka koe o.

Everything is suddenly very clear to me now.	Nusianu me kɔ nam ŋutɔ zi ɖeka fifia.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
It will definitely take time.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi godoo.

It’s a good life here for us.	Enye agbe nyui aɖe le afisia na mí.

After all, he was a man of nothing.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye ŋutsu si me naneke mele o.
But he wasn’t there, not by a long shot.	Gake menɔ afima o, menye to tu didi aɖe dzi o.
I just can’t live another day like this.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe ŋkeke bubu abe esia ene o.
Someone came back and shot at the house.	Ame aɖe trɔ gbɔ va da tu aƒea me.
I don’t necessarily do that.	Menye ɖe mewɔa nenema kokoko o.
My head felt weird.	Nye ta se le ɖokuinye me be mewɔ nuku.

That’s just part of the job.	Dɔa ƒe akpa aɖe koe nye ema.

He had a job for me.	Dɔ aɖe nɔ esi nam.
There was a problem on the highway behind them.	Kuxi aɖe nɔ mɔ gã si le wo megbe la dzi.

And that really pissed me off.	Eye esia do dziku nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.

I think it’s important.	Mesusu be ele vevie.
And of course, this is true.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, esia nye nyateƒe.
He is definitely trying to do too much.	Ele agbagba dzem be yeawɔ nu geɖe akpa godoo.

That’s what it’s for.	Emae nye nusi ta wòle.
That is the most likely scenario.	Emae nye nɔnɔme si ate ŋu adzɔ wu.
I told him there was no chance.	Megblɔ nɛ be mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke meli o.

There is one exception.	Nu ɖeka aɖe li si to vovo na esia.
There is nothing I would be angry about	Naneke meli si ŋu mado dziku ɖo o
Maybe no one knows who he is.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖeke menya amesi wònye o.
There was no joy.	Dzidzɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.

It can happen at this point.	Ate ŋu adzɔ le ɣeyiɣi sia me.

Just because he can.	Esi wòate ŋui ta ko.

In fact, it could be anyone under there.	Le nyateƒe me la, ate ŋu anye amesiame le afima te.

In short, it’s a bad thing.	Kpuie ko la, enye nu gbegblẽ aɖe.

If there is a mistake, raise the exception.	Ne vodada aɖe li la, fɔ nusi to vovo na ema ɖe te.
Honestly, no one knows.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame aɖeke menya o.

Maybe that’s just one thing.	Ðewohĩ nu ɖeka koe nye ema.
They are not fighting for us.	Menye mía tae wole avu wɔm ɖo o.
He tried again and again, he couldn’t get through.	Edze agbagba zi gbɔ zi geɖe, mete ŋu to eme o.

He's at work.	Ele dɔme.
He never did it.	Mewɔe kpɔ o.

It was just an issue for me.	Nya aɖe koe wònye nam.
He will, of course.	Awɔe ya.
I felt my mouth dry	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye nu ƒu
I was anxious to talk to him about it	Metsi dzi be maƒo nu tso eŋu nɛ
I didn't have time for it tonight	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye na esia le zã sia me o
Not to his face, of course.	Menye ɖe eƒe mo ya o.

I wanted to explain myself	Medi be maɖe ɖokuinye me
Not yet, at least.	Menye haɖe o, ya teti.
I thought everything would be fine	Mesusu be nusianu anyo
It’s really the only part that’s hard.	Le nyateƒe me la, eya koe nye akpa si sesẽ.

A first time for that, for him.	Zi gbãtɔ na ema, na eya.
I didn’t know you were going to do this now	Nyemenya be èle esia wɔ ge fifia o

I arranged to stay there at his house the first night.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo be manɔ afima le eƒe aƒeme le zã gbãtɔ me.

It was quite a challenge for me.	Enye kuxi aɖe nam kura.

I got sick of it.	Meva dze dɔ le eŋu.

But without him there would be nothing.	Gake eya manɔmee la, naneke manɔ anyi o.

I still can’t promise anything though	Nyemate ŋu ado naneke ƒe ŋugbe kokoko o ke hã

There was a lot to do.	Nu geɖe nɔ anyi be woawɔ.

But there is no one to help me.	Gake ame aɖeke meli akpe ɖe ŋunye o.

I am acutely aware of that now more than ever	Menya ema vevie fifia wu tsã

I just got a mortgage on that place	Ðeko mexɔ aƒe ƒe fe ɖe teƒe ma
I never wanted this house	Nyemedi aƒe sia gbeɖe o
I would like to move on to another project.	Madi be mayi dɔ bubu aɖe dzi.
I started the whole book	Medze agbalẽ bliboa gɔme
He didn’t say anything either.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke hã o.
I do now, anyway	Mewɔa esia fifia, le mɔ sia mɔ nu
I felt very happy	Mese le ɖokuinye me be dzidzɔ gã aɖe nɔ ŋunye
Every child has a book.	Agbalẽ le ɖevi ɖesiaɖe si.
I think you liked him	Mesusu be eƒe nu lé dzi na wò
I don’t know what else to say.	Nyemenya nya bubu si magblɔ o.
But it is impossible.	Gake manya wɔ o.
I don’t think that’s too important.	Nyemesusu be ema le vevie akpa o.
I used to be for money.	Tsã la, ga tae menye.
I've enjoyed it so far	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu vaseɖe fifia
Things were going pretty well with him.	Nuwo nɔ edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔ kplii.
But be careful.	Gake kpɔ nyuie.
He was the easiest target for her temper.	Enye amesi ŋu eƒe dziku nɔ bɔbɔe wu.
I think that’s appropriate.	Mesusu be esia sɔ.
I was so nervous this morning	Metsi dzodzodzoe ale gbegbe ŋdi sia
He fell off a fucking horse, a week ago.	Edze anyi tso sɔ si nɔ fu ɖem dzi, kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia.
I can’t remember his name	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi o
I went one step further	Meɖe afɔ ɖeka yi ŋgɔ wu ema
This could be you.	Esia ate ŋu anye wò.
We have never been discouraged.	Dzi meɖe le mía ƒo kpɔ o.
There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eme o.
Or one like this.	Alo ɖeka si le abe esia ene.
I was expecting you	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na wò tsã
I think he has a point.	Mesusu be nya aɖe le esi.
This time is different.	Ɣeyiɣi sia to vovo.
That’s a lot of it.	Ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
I knew he was tired of her, and me	Menya be ɖeɖi te eŋu le eŋu, kple nye hã ŋu
I know this very well	Menya esia nyuie ŋutɔ
I think that would work	Mesusu be ema awɔ dɔ
He didn’t seem to recognize anyone.	Edze abe mekpɔ ame aɖeke dze sii o ene.
I just wish we could have killed more	Ðeko medi be míate ŋu awu geɖe wu hafi
I think that’s interesting	Mesusu be nya ma doa dzidzɔ nam
But stay a little longer.	Gake nɔ anyi vie.
Thanks in advance for any comments.	Akpe do ŋgɔ ɖe nya ɖesiaɖe si nàgblɔ ta.
Someone else will do the same.	Ame bubu aɖe hã awɔe nenema.
I can try it.	Mate ŋu ate kpɔ.
I get on well with almost everyone	Mewɔa nu nyuie kple amesiame kloe
That’s not such a big deal to me though.	Ema menye nya gã aɖeke nam nenema o ke hã.
Everything went well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
I don’t know what it was like	Nyemenya alesi wònɔ o
Can't do this place much o' good	Mate ŋu awɔ teƒe sia geɖe o' nyui
You can easily imagine me sweating it out.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nye fifia le eŋu le susu me bɔbɔe.
I'm just not sure what that would be.	Ðeko nyemeka ɖe nusi ema anye dzi o.
They had some ideas.	Susu aɖewo nɔ wo si.
I just understand what you want	Ðeko mese nusi dim nèle la gɔme
I should have had a job	Ðe wòle be dɔ aɖe nanɔ asinye hafi
I tried another time with the same result	Mete ɣeyiɣi bubu kpɔ eye nu ma ke do tso eme
And you don’t want to do that.	Eye mèdi be yeawɔ nu ma o.
There could be more where this comes from.	Afisi esia tso la ate ŋu anɔ anyi geɖe wu.
I think everything will be over soon	Mesusu be nusianu awu enu kpuie
You have to do something for me.	Ele be nàwɔ nane nam.
He didn’t stand up.	Metsi tre o.
This is a nice place.	Teƒe nyui aɖee nye esia.
For a bad day.	Le ŋkeke gbegblẽ aɖe ta.

I may have more work for them very soon	Dɔ geɖe ate ŋu anɔ asinye na wo kpuie ŋutɔ
That’s a lot of money.	Ema nye ga gã aɖe.
There is no problem there.	Kuxi aɖeke mele afima o.
Yourself, if necessary.	Wò ŋutɔ, ne ehiã.
But I never saw anyone there	Gake nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke le afima kpɔ o
Some are faster than these guys.	Ame aɖewo le du dzi wu ŋutsu siawo.
He had only one rule.	Se aɖe koe nɔ esi.
He can call her, find out where she is.	Ate ŋu aƒo ka nɛ, anya afisi wòle.
I don’t know what to do with him	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ nɛ o
I have to do this myself	Ele be nye ŋutɔ mawɔ esia
There are four identical faces in the room	Mo ene siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo le xɔa me
I treated very few people well.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe mewɔa nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu nyuie.
I need my people in my life	Mehiã nye amewo le nye agbe me
I really can’t say much more than that	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe wu ema o
Some of them seem pretty obvious.	Edze abe wo dometɔ aɖewo dze ƒã ŋutɔ ene.
The first is about what it can do for us.	Gbãtɔ ku ɖe nusi wòate ŋu awɔ na mí ŋu.
I wanted to be alone for a while	Medi be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi vie
Any help would be great.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe anyo ŋutɔ.
There is no reason for anything.	Susu mele naneke me o.
How he had been there for her.	Alesi wònɔ afima nɛ tsã.
Or anyone else for that matter.	Alo ame bubu ɖesiaɖe le nya ma ta.
As you progress through the process, the task is likely to become clearer.	Ne èle ŋgɔ yim le dɔa me la, anɔ eme be dɔa me kɔ nyuie wu.
I can only speak for myself	Nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye koe mate ŋu aƒo nu
I couldn’t bring myself to let go	Nyemete ŋu tsɔ ɖokuinye va be maɖe asi le eŋu o
We look forward to working with you.	Míele mɔ kpɔm vevie be míawɔ dɔ kpli wò.
I just wanted to say something	Ðeko medi be magblɔ nya aɖe
I just want to be like that.	Ðeko medi be manɔ nenema.
I know a lot of things	Menya nu geɖe ŋutɔ
I was very hot.	Mexɔ dzo ŋutɔ.
Honestly, I could be angry with him	Le nyateƒe me la, mate ŋu ado dziku ɖe eŋu
I can’t see you like that	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wò nenema o
I am close to you, not the other way around	Mete ɖe ŋuwò, ke menye le mɔ bubu nu o
And there was another problem besides.	Eye kuxi bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi kpe ɖe eŋu.
I have an apartment nearby	Xɔ aɖe le asinye si te ɖe afima ŋu
This time something is different.	Fifia ya nane to vovo.
I have something to tell you.	Nya aɖe le asinye magblɔ na mi.
I need to know what it looks like	Ele be manya ale si wòle
It’s definitely amazing.	Ewɔ nuku godoo.
That’s the truth.	Emae nye nyateƒe.
I would go further, actually.	Mayi ŋgɔ wu ema, le nyateƒe me.
I will do this by myself if necessary.	Mawɔ esia to nye ŋutɔ nye asi dzi ne ehiã.
I couldn’t lie to him	Nyemete ŋu da alakpa nɛ o
However, he didn’t do anything.	Ke hã, mewɔ naneke o.
I had to protect myself	Ele be makpɔ ɖokuinye ta
Thank you so much!!.	Akpe geɖe na mi!!.
In this case, few things could be better.	Le go sia me la, nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe ate ŋu anyo wu.
But that doesn’t work here.	Gake ema mewɔa dɔ le afisia o.
And so will he be.	Eye eya hã anɔ nenema.
I have to go from now on	Ele be mayi tso fifia
I told him what was going on	Megblɔ nu si le edzi yim la nɛ
Maybe not much, but .	Ðewohĩ menye geɖe o, gake .
None of them can win.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu aɖu dzi o.
But there is a name.	Gake ŋkɔ aɖe li.
A man came out of the house	Ŋutsu aɖe do go le aƒea me
But tonight that was different.	Gake le zã sia me la, nya ma to vovo.
I never had to deal with that.	Mehiã be makpɔ ema gbɔ gbeɖe o.
I am angry with him now too	Nye hã medo dziku ɖe eŋu fifia
The issue is not new.	Nya la menye nya yeye o.
I did something today	Mewɔ nane egbea
I stayed there for a few days	Menɔ afima ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo
I always have to work	Ele be mawɔ dɔ ɣesiaɣi
I don’t think he can do that	Nyemesusu be ate ŋu awɔ nu ma o
I want to know what he wants	Medi be manya nusi dim wòle
I think he has a point.	Mesusu be nya aɖe le esi.
That’s the problem with the truth.	Emae nye kuxi si le nyateƒea ŋu.
There was no time to plan.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi be woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu o.
I am never going to forgive myself	Nyemele etsɔ ge ake ɖokuinye gbeɖe o
Here, move there.	Le afisia la, ʋu yi afima.
I am not important	Nyemele vevie o
It will never work.	Mawɔ dɔ gbeɖe o.
I don't know what happened to him though.	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi o ke hã.
This must be done.	Ele be woawɔ esia.
I think that would have been almost a year ago now	Mesusu be ema anye ƒe ɖeka kloe enye sia fifia
I wouldn't mind .	Maɖe fu nam be .
I have to go out and work like everyone else	Ele be mado go awɔ dɔ abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene
A new song was starting	Ha yeye aɖe nɔ egɔme dzem
I’ve grown up like that	Metsi nenema kpɔ
I used to, anyway	Tsã la, mewɔe, le mɔ sia mɔ nu
I was a little surprised	Ewɔ nuku nam vie
It obviously worked.	Edze ƒã be ewɔ dɔ.
But it most likely won’t.	Gake anɔ eme godoo be mawɔe nenema o.
Everyone else has the same problem.	Kuxi ma ke le ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã ŋu.
I was hoping it would work well	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ nyuie
I saved his life, after all	Meɖe eƒe agbe, le nyateƒe me
I couldn’t show this.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe esia fia o.
We have two of them here.	Wo dometɔ eve le mía si le afisia.
Are you there.	Èle afima.
He is taking care of himself.	Eya le eɖokui dzi kpɔm.
This was a wonderful day.	Esia nye ŋkeke nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I need to call them now	Ele be maƒo ka na wo fifia
I tried to find it for weeks	Medze agbagba be madi kwasiɖa geɖe
I was too quick for them though.	Mewɔ kaba akpa na wo gake.
I was deeply saddened by his comment	Eƒe nya sia te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
But they have a strategy.	Gake aɖaŋu aɖe le wo si.
You’re missing the point.	Èle nya la tom.
Now, it’s really simple.	Fifia, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t have a house	Aƒe aɖeke mele asinye o
I think it can get that far	Mesusu be ate ŋu aɖo afima nenema gbegbe
That’s totally right.	Ema sɔ kura.
And that’s right.	Eye esia sɔ.
Many of us do this.	Mía dometɔ geɖe wɔa esia.
An issue we cannot go to	Nya aɖe si gbɔ míate ŋu ayi o
I could never do that	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma gbeɖe o
Without your work, this book would not exist.	Ne menye wò dɔa o la, anye ne agbalẽ sia manɔ anyi o.
Many people died because of that.	Ame geɖe ku ɖe ema ta.
A long shot, but you never know	Tu didi aɖe, gake mènya gbeɖe o
I think it’s a lost cause	Mesusu be enye nusi bu
I had to try something unexpected	Ele be mate nane si nyemele mɔ kpɔm na o la kpɔ
I couldn’t get out of it, really	Nyemete ŋu do le eme o, le nyateƒe me
They had a lot in common.	Nu geɖe nɔ wo dome si sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
In fact, no one seems to have a heart.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze abe ame aɖeke ƒe dzi mele eme o ene.
I still have this problem	Kuxi sia gakpɔtɔ le ŋunye
You usually have nothing.	Zi geɖe la, naneke mele asiwò o.
I can definitely imagine that.	Mate ŋu akpɔ nya ma le susu me godoo.
I didn’t have time to call them	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye maƒo ka na wo o
I would like one though.	Madi ɖeka gake.
He made a plan for it.	Ewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
I had everything to myself.	Nusianu nɔ asinye na ɖokuinye.
This was unexpected.	Esia menɔ mɔ kpɔm na o.
I need to know you’re okay	Ele be manya be èle nyuie
I think it could be something else	Mesusu be ate ŋu anye nu bubu aɖe hã
I was still very angry	Nye dziku gakpɔtɔ nɔ fu ɖem nam ŋutɔ
He was very hot now.	Eƒe lãme xɔ dzo ŋutɔ fifia.
I would rather work as a teacher than work here	Anyo nam wu be mawɔ dɔ abe nufiala ene tsɔ wu be mawɔ dɔ le afisia
Something struck him.	Nane ƒo ɖe eŋu.
And for two reasons.	Eye susu eve aɖewo tae.
There were four people in the car, including me.	Ame ene nɔ ʋua me, eye nye hã nɔ asinye.
It had been a busy night.	Zã si me vovo menɔ eŋu o ye wònye tsã.
I can do anything here	Mate ŋu awɔ nusianu le afisia
Please recommend someone new.	Taflatse ɖo aɖaŋu na ame yeye aɖe.
Please, come.	Taflatse, va.

Why they are enduring.	Nusita wole dzi dom ɖo.
But still one.	Gake ɖeka kokoko.
But it doesn’t matter.	Gake mehiã o.
There is a lot of space in it.	Teƒe geɖe le eme.
He didn’t say much about it.	Megblɔ nya geɖe tso eŋu o.
There were some parts.	Akpa aɖewo nɔ anyi.
He didn’t care, really.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o, le nyateƒe me.
I couldn’t look up.	Nyemete ŋu fɔ mo dzi o.

In fact, we can do better than that.	Le nyateƒe me la, míate ŋu awɔ nu nyuie wu ema.
I told you that once	Megblɔ nya ma na mi zi ɖeka
I have a new job now.	Dɔ yeye aɖe le ŋunye fifia.

Never heard of any of them	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o
Food was never a problem there.	Nuɖuɖu menye kuxi le afima gbeɖe o.
Give a day here, take a day there.	Na ŋkeke ɖeka le afisia, tsɔ ŋkeke ɖeka ɖe afima.
And that will be on me.	Eye ema anɔ dzinye.
I got sick after a while	Meva dze dɔ le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe
He is coming to a town near you.	Ele du aɖe si te ɖe ŋuwò me gbɔna.

It wasn’t working.	Menɔ dɔ wɔm o.
Anyone interested in going?.	Ame aɖe si tsɔ ɖe le eme be yeayi?.
I didn’t make that up	Menye nyee wɔ nya ma o
An old one.	Xoxo aɖe.

You can do the same with your dog.	Àte ŋu awɔ nenema ke ɖe wò avu hã ŋu.
I was looking for another place.	Menɔ teƒe bubu dim.

Almost no one did.	Ame aɖeke kloe mewɔe nenema o.
He never wanted me to	Medi be mawɔe gbeɖe o
At least once.	Zi ɖeka ya teti.
I seemed to know that would work for me.	Edze abe menya be ema awɔ dɔ nam ene.
I can do it on my own	Mate ŋu awɔe le ɖokuinye si
But he couldn’t find it.	Gake mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.

I never heard them come in before	Nyemese wo ge ɖe eme kpɔ o
But there is one exception.	Gake ɖeka aɖe li si to vovo na ema.

Some may not.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖewo mawɔe nenema o.
Not yet, anyway.	Menye haɖe o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
But think about this.	Gake bu nya sia ŋu kpɔ.
It’s where he’s been, and where he needs to be.	Enye afisi wònɔ, kple afisi wòle be eya hã nanɔ.
There are some holes in the back as well.	Do aɖewo le megbe hã.
He tried to move forward.	Edze agbagba be yeayi ŋgɔ.

There is no job.	Dɔ aɖeke meli o.
They had a job to do.	Dɔ nɔ wo si woawɔ.
Help me out here.	Kpe ɖe ŋunye le afisia.
It wasn’t easy for me.	Menɔ bɔbɔe nam o.
I probably could have helped him that night.	Anɔ eme be mate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu le zã ma me hafi.
This is just a small thing.	Esia nye nu sue aɖe ko.
I just couldn’t work.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu wɔ dɔ o.

I really do like him	Mewɔa nu abe eya ene ŋutɔŋutɔ

It didn’t help at all.	Meɖe vi aɖeke kura o.
You are in a different state, in a bad state.	Èle nɔnɔme bubu me, le nɔnɔme gbegblẽ me.
That’s just one meal.	Nuɖuɖu ɖeka koe nye ema.
I think he would have done that.	Mesusu be anye ne awɔe nenema hafi.
I thought something was wrong.	Mesusu be nane gblẽ.
He can’t do that.	Mate ŋu awɔe nenema o.
I have to say some things	Ele nam be magblɔ nya aɖewo
Each word represents one person.	Nya ɖesiaɖe tsi tre ɖi na ame ɖeka.

I can’t give up.	Nyemate ŋu ana ta o.
But for something else.	Gake le nu bubu aɖe ta.
It can kill you.	Ate ŋu awu wò.
I honestly didn’t expect that to be possible.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemekpɔ mɔ be ema ate ŋu adzɔ o.
Few survived.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe tsi agbe.

I tried many ways.	Mete mɔ geɖe kpɔ.

No one could get inside.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu ge ɖe eme o.
It would be nice, but impossible.	Anyo, gake manya wɔ o.
I was concerned about that	Metsi dzi ɖe nya ma ŋu

However, he didn’t come.	Ke hã, meva o.
He hadn't had one in a long time.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka menɔ esi le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe me o.
I can see that from here.	Mete ŋu kpɔa ema tso afisia.
It’s just that way.	Ðeko wòle nenema.
I couldn’t seem to get myself to leave	Edze abe nyemete ŋu na ɖokuinye dzo o ene
I have to marry you now	Ele nam be maɖe wò fifia
If you don’t have it, you don’t have it.	Ne mele asiwò o la, ke mele asiwò o.
I don’t have to be happy about it	Mehiã be makpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu o
It is possible, but it is far from easy.	Ate ŋu adzɔ, gake mele bɔbɔe kura o.
But I like that about you	Gake nya ma dzɔa dzi nam le ŋuwò
It was a difficult day for us.	Enye ŋkeke sesẽ aɖe na mí.
I don’t want the money	Nyemedi ga la o
I just can, feel it	Ðeko mate ŋu, ase le ɖokuinye me

In itself, that was reason enough to get involved.	Le eɖokui si la, emae nye susu si sɔ gbɔ be maƒo ɖokuinye ɖe eme.
I may not have much time	Ðewohĩ ɣeyiɣi geɖe manɔ asinye o
But not in a good way.	Gake menye le mɔ nyui aɖe nu o.

And we enjoy the good things in life.	Eye nu nyui siwo le agbe me la dzɔa dzi na mí.

We had very little money.	Ga sue aɖe koe nɔ mía si.
This is not exactly true.	Esia menye nyateƒe tututu o.

I should have done it myself at least once	Ðe wòle be nye ŋutɔ mawɔe zi ɖeka ya teti hafi
I need a better strategy.	Mehiã aɖaŋu si nyo wu.
Why? 	Nu ka ta?
I work hard on this stuff	Mewɔa dɔ sesĩe le nu sia ŋu
Many people do this.	Ame geɖe wɔa esia.
I had grown up with him	Metsi kplii kpɔ
The whole project.	Dɔ bliboa katã.
Mine never worked.	Nye tɔ mewɔ dɔ kpɔ o.
It’s a normal thing.	Enye nusi sɔ.
I can't seem to find it again though	Edze abe nyemate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu ake o ene gake
Nothing very strange there.	Naneke mewɔ nuku ŋutɔ le afima o.
But I know what the word means.	Gake menya nusi nya la fia.
And things have changed here.	Eye nuwo trɔ le afisia.
It will be good for the whole project.	Anyo na dɔa katã.
I can make this work	Mate ŋu ana esia nawɔ dɔ
His voice is not his own.	Eƒe gbe menye eya ŋutɔ tɔ o.
I wonder how much time has passed already	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɣeyiɣi didi kae va yi xoxo hã
I lived like a man.	Menɔ agbe abe ŋutsu ene.
Usually it is	Zi geɖe la, ele nenema
And for very little money.	Eye ɖe ga sue aɖe ko ta.
But it would be bad for me.	Gake anye nu gbegblẽ nam.
In anger, perhaps.	Le dziku me, ɖewohĩ.
But the opposite is true.	Gake nusi to vovo kura na emae.
But you are new to this.	Gake ènye ame yeye le esia me.
I can’t take that away	Nyemate ŋu aɖe ema ɖa o
That’s what it is here.	Emae nye afisia.
Not surprising after everything he’d done all night.	Mewɔ nuku o le nusianu si wòwɔ le zã bliboa me megbe.
I had a lot of fun times	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe
They still have guns.	Tu gakpɔtɔ le wo si.
The first thing about it was boring.	Nu gbãtɔ si ku ɖe eŋu la te ɖeɖi eŋu.
I have about four days.	Anɔ abe ŋkeke ene ene le asinye.
I don’t know where to go from there.	Nyemenya afi si mayi tso afima o.
It was a huge mistake	Vodada gã aɖee wònye
Everyone knew things were bad.	Amesiame nya be nuwo gblẽ.
I know some people who do.	Menya ame aɖewo siwo wɔa esia.
I could imagine how this might feel	Mete ŋu kpɔ alesi esia ate ŋu ase le eɖokui me le susu me
Maybe I was a little worried	Ðewohĩ metsi dzi vie
That makes sense.	Susu le nya ma me.
Maybe every moment is the last.	Ðewohĩ ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe nye mamlɛtɔ.
We are not allowing this.	Míele mɔ ɖem ɖe esia ŋu o.
He didn’t really want to do that.	Medi ŋutɔŋutɔ be yeawɔ nu ma o.
I wondered if people back home were worried about me	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe ame siwo le aƒeme la tsi dzi ɖe ŋunye hã
You can get out of this.	Àte ŋu ado le esia me.
Find something else to do.	Di nu bubu aɖe si nàwɔ.
I have nothing left for myself.	Naneke megale asinye na ɖokuinye o.
On the la.	Le la dzi.
Why he would do that is beyond me.	Nusita wòawɔ nenema la gbɔ nye hã ŋu.
A lot of people have pieces	Ame geɖe ŋutɔ ƒe akpa aɖewo le wo si
I don’t know, inside	Nyemenya o, le eme
I needed to do some things	Ehiã be mawɔ nu aɖewo
I can engage them from here	Mate ŋu ado ŋugbe na wo tso afisia
He will know what to do.	Anya nusi wòawɔ.
I can’t bear this without knowing	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi le esia nu esi nyemenya o
Maybe tonight or tomorrow.	Ðewohĩ le zã sia me alo etsɔ me.
Just a little good sense.	Susu nyui vi aɖe ko.
I know them too well	Menya wo nyuie akpa
Just one day.	Ŋkeke ɖeka ko.
On top of that, it happened at a difficult time in my life.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu la, edzɔ le nye agbe me ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe me.
I hope he does that for another two months.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔe nenema ɣleti eve bubu.
I could do that idea for you if that was easier	Mate ŋu awɔ susu ma na wò nenye be ema le bɔbɔe wu
I have to be there now	Ele be manɔ afima fifia
Just not for the right reasons.	Ðeko menye le susu nyui aɖeke ta o.
I can be like that	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema
I’ve never seen this in any other job.	Nyemekpɔ esia le dɔ bubu aɖeke me kpɔ o.
It’s nothing more complicated than that.	Menye naneke si sesẽ wu ema o.
Usually it’s you.	Zi geɖe la, wòe.
This lives on.	Esia nɔa agbe.
I understand what it is.	Mese nusi wònye gɔme.
There is a job that needs to be done.	Dɔ aɖe li si wòle be woawɔ.
I have no idea what this means	Nyemenya nusi esia fia o
They don’t have to do that, really.	Mehiã be woawɔ ema o, le nyateƒe me.
I really shouldn’t have said that	Le nyateƒe me la, mele be magblɔ nya ma o
Which is very likely true.	Nusi anya nye nyateƒe ŋutɔ.
A new house will be built.	Woawɔ aƒe yeye aɖe.
I am looking forward to them	Mele mɔ kpɔm na wo vevie
I tried several times with the same result.	Mete kpɔ zi geɖe eye nu ɖeka ma ke do tso eme.
There is nothing he can do.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ o.
The questions they are asking don’t make sense.	Susu mele nya siwo biam wole la me o.
Someone will speak.	Ame aɖe aƒo nu.
The thing will be over.	Nu la awu enu.
I had no idea what was going on behind the scenes	Nyemenya nusi nɔ edzi yim le megbe nɛ o
I know what’s in there	Menya nusi le afima
I shouldn’t have spoken out loud	Mele be maƒo nu sesĩe hafi o
I know nothing between us is real	Menya be naneke mele mía dome si nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o
He did what he could.	Ewɔ nu si wòate ŋui.
No one denied that.	Ame aɖeke megbe nya ma o.
Yet my mind was idle.	Ke hã nye susu nɔ dɔ aɖeke wɔm o.
I haven’t seen you in a long time	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia nyemekpɔ wò o
Not like him.	Menye abe eya ene o.
I just wanted to come to the room	Ðeko medi be mava xɔa me
It’s definitely a big deal for us.	Enye nu gã aɖe na mí godoo.
I heard about all that happened	Mese nu siwo katã dzɔ la ŋu nya
I need to do it more often	Ehiã be mawɔe zi geɖe wu
It’s not that complicated.	Menye nusi me kɔ nenema gbegbe o.
I don’t think anyone else ever approached them	Mesusu be ame bubu aɖeke mete ɖe wo ŋu kpɔ o
I like everything about it	Nusianu si ku ɖe eŋu la dzɔa dzi nam
But they are asking for help.	Gake wole kpekpeɖeŋu biam.
I had a great car.	Ʋu gã aɖe nɔ asinye.
I got things to deal with here	Mexɔ nu siwo makpɔ gbɔ le afisia
But nothing worked out for him.	Gake naneke medze edzi nɛ o.
Very simple, ideal.	Nusi le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ, si sɔ nyuie.
I thought it would do me good	Mesusu be awɔ nyui nam
Through the summer.	To dzomeŋɔli me.
I wonder what’s going on in that pool of his	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae le edzi yim le eƒe ta ma me hã
We have rules and regulations.	Se kple ɖoɖo le mía si.
Stir everything in it.	Tsɔ nusianu ƒo ɖe eme.
But that is highly unlikely.	Gake ema mate ŋu adzɔ kura o.
I wasn’t impressed, and I said as much to him	Mewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye o, eye megblɔ nya geɖe nɛ nenema ke
Maybe some people do this too.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖewo hã wɔa esia.
But he was not in good health.	Gake eƒe lãme menɔ nyuie o.
I was too shocked to speak	Ewɔ nuku nam akpa be nyemate ŋu aƒo nu o
He can handle that.	Ate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ.
I can't deal with them	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu o
And at home it still is.	Eye le aƒeme la, ele nenema haɖe.
I don’t know what’s wrong	Nyemenya nusi gblẽ o
I am going to bring some clothes and stuff.	Mele awu aɖewo kple nu aɖewo va ge ɖe asi.
We could not have done such a good job.	Míate ŋu awɔ dɔ nyui ma gbegbe hafi o.
I think he likes you	Mesusu be wò nu lé dzi nɛ
I need to make a plan or something	Ele be mawɔ ɖoɖo alo nane
Making a great single.	Tre gã aɖe wɔwɔ.
That used to be a reality.	Ema nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ tsã.
I felt so sick.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be medze dɔ ale gbegbe.
A lot depends on your preference as well	Nu geɖe nɔ te ɖe wò didi hã dzi
There isn’t much in it.	Nu geɖe mele eme o.
But it has no bones.	Gake ƒu mele eŋu o.
Things don’t seem to exist.	Edze abe nuwo meli o ene.
I think you can go now	Mesusu be àte ŋu ayi fifia
I probably owe him my life	Anɔ eme be nye agbe ƒe fe le ŋunye
I can’t talk about it now	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu tso eŋu fifia o
I couldn’t control myself at all	Nyemete ŋu ɖu ɖokuinye dzi kura o
It just wasn’t.	Ðeko menɔ nenema o.
I was just looking for food	Nuɖuɖu ko dim menɔ
I wasn’t doing any of this stuff.	Menye nyee nɔ nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke wɔm o.
But he could never tell her that.	Gake mete ŋu gblɔ nya ma nɛ gbeɖe o.
I never had a moment where I was like that	Nyemekpɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖeke si me menɔ nenema kpɔ o
I do everything by myself	Nye ɖeka koe wɔa nusianu
I know exactly where to look	Menya afisi tututu madi
It was his idea.	Enye eƒe susu.
A car came by.	Ʋu aɖe va to afima.
I never knew what it was.	Nyemenya nusi wònye gbeɖe o.
Be very careful when working for these guys.	Kpɔ nyuie ŋutɔ ne èle dɔ wɔm na ŋutsu siawo.
I have made my point	Megblɔ nye nya la
I would have liked to have done that.	Anye ne madi be mawɔe nenema hafi.

A day like this.	Ŋkeke si le abe esia ene.

I just can’t stand it	Ðeko nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu o
Thousands of people.	Ame akpe geɖe.
For many reasons, that was just a bad idea.	Le susu geɖe ta la, susu gbegblẽ aɖe koe ema nye.
And there were other similarities.	Eye nu bubu siwo ɖi wo nɔewo hã nɔ anyi.
He was a good horse.	Enye sɔ nyui aɖe.
I was able to.	Mete ŋui.
Usually a year.	Zi geɖe la, ƒe ɖeka.
Finally, if some teeth are missing.	Mlɔeba la, ne aɖu aɖewo bu.
You can find some of them here.	Àte ŋu akpɔ wo dometɔ aɖewo le afisia.
I told myself it didn’t matter	Megblɔ na ɖokuinye be mehiã o
I was amazed at the great situation	Nɔnɔme gã la wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
I had engaged myself to another man	Medo ŋugbe na ɖokuinye na ŋutsu bubu kpɔ
I can usually handle people	Zi geɖe la, mate ŋu akpɔ amewo gbɔ
I can’t see clearly	Nyemete ŋu kpɔa nu nyuie o
It was a very extreme thing.	Enye nusi gbɔ eme ŋutɔ.
If you have a water problem, we can help.	Ne tsi ƒe kuxi aɖe le ŋuwò la, míate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I don’t have any children.	Vi aɖeke mele asinye o.

Sit down, kid.	Nɔ anyi ɖe, ɖevi.

I couldn’t hear a word	Nyemete ŋu se nya aɖeke o
Maybe not everything.	Ðewohĩ menye nusianu o.

A very great song.	Ha gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But it shouldn’t be surprising.	Gake mele be wòawɔ nuku o.
I can get there in about an hour	Mate ŋu aɖo afima le abe gaƒoƒo ɖeka ene megbe
Just the truth, exactly what you think.	Nyateƒea ko, nusi tututu nèsusu.
These cars became very expensive.	Ʋu siawo va xɔ asi ale gbegbe.
And that’s enough.	Eye ema sɔ gbɔ.
I am in a difficult position here	Mele nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe me le afisia
I need a word for you too.	Mehiã nya aɖe na wò hã.
Can someone tell me where I am going wrong.	Ðe ame aɖe ate ŋu agblɔ afisi mele vodada wɔm le nam.
I could have killed you	Anye ne mate ŋu awu wò hafi
Quite a bit actually.	Vi aɖe ŋutɔ le nyateƒe me.
But you can’t be negative now about anything or anyone.	Gake màte ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ fifia le naneke alo ame aɖeke ŋu o.
That doesn’t make much sense.	Susu boo aɖeke mele nya ma me o.

He has a heart.	Dzi le esi.
I'm not close enough, mind	Nyemete ɖe eŋu tututu o, susu
I know you can do the job	Menya be àte ŋu awɔ dɔa
If you’re not into that, you’re not there.	Ne mèle ema me o la, mèle afima o.
Until, finally, finally.	Vaseɖe esime, mlɔeba, mlɔeba.
I don’t know if this thing exists or not.	Nyemenya ne nu sia li alo meli o.
I liked the way he was talking about it.	Ale si wònɔ nu ƒom tso eŋu la dze ŋunye.
He did the impossible.	Ewɔ nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o la.
One day at a time is a good plan.	Gbe ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me nye ɖoɖo nyui aɖe.
That was what he wanted.	Emae nye nusi dim wònɔ.
I always remembered it.	Meɖo ŋku edzi ɣesiaɣi.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will happen.	Ðewohĩ menye egbea o, ɖewohĩ menye etsɔ o, gake adzɔ.
You have to tell me what it is you want.	Ele be nàgblɔ nusi wònye nèdi nam.
And that’s very difficult.	Eye esia sesẽ ŋutɔ.

And once you figure it out, do it.	Eye ne ènya bu eŋu ko la, wɔe.

He didn’t notice anything.	Mekpɔ naneke dze sii o.

I wasn’t happy.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
I wanted what they had	Nusi le wo si la dim menɔ
Decide what it is you want.	Tso nya me le nusi wònye nèdi ŋu.
It was an idea unto itself.	Enye susu aɖe na eɖokui.

Or maybe two.	Alo ɖewohĩ eve.
I can’t explain what happened to the people who were there.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nusi dzɔ ɖe ame siwo nɔ afi ma dzi la me o.
I knew he needed help	Menya be ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu

He had no children.	Vi aɖeke menɔ esi o.
A lot of bad things happened to him.	Nu gbegblẽ geɖe dzɔ ɖe edzi.

You know how they are now.	Ènya alesi wole fifia.

No one knows what happened, exactly.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi dzɔ o, tututu.

And yet we know so little about it.	Eye ke hã míenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o.
But it would have been completely unreasonable.	Gake anye ne susu mele eme kura o.

No one can do it on their own, of course.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔe le eɖokui si ya o.

Nothing can do it.	Naneke mate ŋui o.

I began to wonder if he had no other qualities	Meva nɔ ɖokuinye biam be ɖe nɔnɔme bubu aɖeke mele esi o hã

Many thought this was impossible.	Ame geɖe susui be esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.

It was amazing how well this worked.	Alesi esia wɔ dɔ nyuie la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.

However, the impossible happened.	Ke hã, nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o la dzɔ.
And there is nothing like that.	Eye naneke mele nenema o.

I could see the anger on his face	Mete ŋu kpɔa dziku si nɔ eƒe mo
It’s a really easy job.	Enye dɔ si le bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.

I was just another face among many	Mo bubu aɖe koe menye le ame geɖe dome
It doesn’t seem to be.	Edze abe mele nenema o ene.
That has worked before.	Ema wɔ dɔ do ŋgɔ.
I interpreted that as a positive	Meɖe nya ma gɔme be enye nu nyui aɖe
I can pretty much do anything here	Mate ŋu awɔ nusianu kloe le afisia
I had enough to go on	Nusi sɔ gbɔ nɔ asinye be mayi edzi
I really like this .	Esia dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ .
He didn’t answer her.	Meɖo eŋu nɛ o.
But many others are not so sure.	Gake ame bubu geɖe meka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o.
There are two reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo tae wòle alea ɖo.
I could do it again on my own	Mate ŋu awɔe ake le ɖokuinye si
Otherwise return false.	Ne menye nenema o la, trɔ alakpa.
Mine was amazing.	Nye tɔ la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
The issue is in your hands.	Nya la le asiwò.
I was tired of doing this	Esia wɔwɔ ɖeɖi te ŋunye
Maybe they’re just having a bad day.	Ðewohĩ ŋkeke gbegblẽ aɖe koe le wo dzi.
I'll see you next week.	Makpɔ wò le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me.
Who doesn’t need a home.	Ame si mehiã aƒe o.
He can’t stay here.	Mate ŋu anɔ afisia o.
I’m a private person in a way too	Nye hã menye ame ŋutɔ ƒe ame aɖe le mɔ aɖe nu
I finally decided to go with them.	Meɖoe mlɔeba be mayi kpli wo.
They make sense.	Susu le wo me.
I know a lot of people	Menya ame geɖe
I made a plan for it.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
You can do it.	Àte ŋu awɔe.
When and he knows yet which he is on.	Ɣekaɣie kple eya nya haɖe si dzi wòle.
I have no idea what this could be	Nyemenya nusi esia ate ŋu anye o
All you need is money.	Nusi hiã koe nye ga.
Focus on that now.	Lé fɔ ɖe ema ŋu fifia.
But he is the only one who speaks.	Gake eya koe ƒoa nu.
I was only interested in the work.	Dɔa koe metsɔ ɖe le.
We know it will eventually happen to us.	Míenya be ava dzɔ ɖe mía dzi mlɔeba.
I had to meet with my people	Ele be mado go kple nye amewo
I just had to do something	Ðeko wòle be mawɔ nane
That’s pretty amazing, too.	Ema hã wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Nice to see them though.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mekpɔ wo gake.
It’s a lot of things together.	Enye nu geɖe ɖekae.
I know it’s true	Menya be enye nyateƒe
That is the truth of it.	Emae nye nyateƒe si le eme.
I didn’t have time for this	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye na esia o
Hold his hand.	Lé eƒe asi.
I never knew anyone who had left	Nyemenya ame aɖeke si dzo kpɔ o
I wonder what it’s like	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke wòle hã
I saw them on myself.	Mekpɔ wo le ɖokuinye ŋu.
That’s a bad thing.	Ema nye nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
I told you you would end up alone	Megblɔ na wò be wò ɖeka koe ava wu enu
I can’t remember ever doing that in my life	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi be mewɔ nu ma kpɔ le nye agbe me o
Not since last week.	Menye tso kwasiɖa si va yi me o.
A small one.	Sue aɖe.
I was going backwards.	Menɔ megbe yim.
I didn’t expect that.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be...
I used to be one of them	Menye wo dometɔ ɖeka tsã
Also use common sense.	Zã susu nyui hã.
Life went on without him.	Agbe nɔ edzi yim eya manɔmee.
That never crossed my mind.	Ema meva susu me nam kpɔ o.
One of his men was waiting.	Eƒe amewo dometɔ ɖeka nɔ lalam.
I shouldn’t have been there	Mele be manɔ afima hafi o
However, there are many problems with this.	Ke hã, kuxi geɖe le esia ŋu.
And not that long ago.	Eye menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia o.

Today I am one of her.	Egbea eƒe ame aɖee nye nye.
You can do this in a few ways.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia le mɔ ʋɛ aɖewo nu.
But not this week.	Gake menye le kwasiɖa sia me o.
Just one man’s.	Ŋutsu ɖeka ko tɔ.
What is going on?.	Nukae le edzi yim?.
He couldn’t see.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu o.
I couldn’t finish this book without you	Nyemate ŋu awu agbalẽ sia nu wò manɔmee o
I am right here with you	Mele afisia tututu kpli wò
You definitely need to do something with your hair.	Ele be nàwɔ nane kple wò ɖa godoo.
I had a life to go on	Agbe aɖe nɔ asinye si me mayi edzi anɔ
I hope that helps!. 	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ema akpe ɖe ŋuwò!. 
I never understood why he did that	Nyemese nusita wòwɔ nu ma gɔme gbeɖe o
He’s sick.	Edze dɔ.
It’s the same thing with these people.	Nu ɖeka koe wònye ɖe ame siawo ŋu.
It was a difficult time in our lives.	Enye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe le míaƒe agbe me.
This is wireless.	Esia nye ka manɔmee.
I have to get out.	Ele be mado go.
You may know a few of them.	Ðewohĩ ènya wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo.
I am asking myself	Mele nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye biam
The truth is one truth.	Nyateƒea nye nyateƒe ɖeka.
He still couldn’t decide.	Mete ŋu tso nya me kokoko o.
I don’t know, man.	Nyemenya o, ŋutsu.
I will meet with you	Mado go kpli wò
I had no idea what was going through his head	Nyemenya nusi nɔ eƒe ta me tom o
There’s a lot of money there.	Ga geɖe le afima.
He was just doing something for himself on his own time.	Ðeko wònɔ nane wɔm na eɖokui le eƒe ɣeyiɣi dzi.
That works well.	Ema wɔa dɔ nyuie.
Something wasn’t happening to me	Nane nɔ to yim nam
I knew they were here	Menya be wole afisia
I saw that one.	Mekpɔ ɖeka ma.
Not at all.	Menye gbeɖe o.
As a result, we lost a lot of money.	Esia wɔe be ga geɖe bu na mí.
For two months at least.	Ɣleti eve enye sia ya teti.
It is the opposite.	Enye nusi to vovo na ema.
But these guys are nothing new.	Gake ŋutsu siawo menye nu yeye o.
There was nothing for him there.	Naneke menɔ anyi nɛ le afima o.
I want to talk to him	Medi be maƒo nu kplii
I made a mistake when I approached him	Mewɔ vodada esi mete ɖe eŋu
So is he, too.	Eya hã le nenema.
But the end result was well worth it	Gake nu mamlɛtɔ si do tso eme la ɖe vi ŋutɔ
I can’t do everything.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nusianu o.
I went out in the afternoon	Medo go le ŋdɔ me
I can’t do this again	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia ake o
I didn’t know what to do either.	Nye hã nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
It’s not because of something you did.	Menye nane si nèwɔ tae o.
I came in the mouth	Meva le nu me
I just need to share this with people	Ðeko wòle be magblɔ nya sia na amewo
And two, this isn’t one of a kind.	Eye eve, esia menye eƒe ƒomevi ɖeka o.
No one has ever done that.	Ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
A great one.	Gã aɖe.
I had the same thought	Susu ma ke nɔ menye
No one knows much about it.	Ame aɖeke menya nu geɖe tso eŋu o.
I can’t very well refuse	Nyemate ŋu agbe nyuie ŋutɔ o
He didn’t ask for help.	Mebia kpekpeɖeŋu o.
Stay here in the house.	Nɔ aƒea me afisia.
The air, first.	Ya la, gbãtɔ.
You never know what might come up.	Mènya nusi ate ŋu ado mo ɖa gbeɖe o.
He was very clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ.
But he tried.	Gake edze agbagba.
We hope it helps you.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
Just like that other guy did.	Abe alesi ŋutsu bubu ma wɔe ene.
I could tell this all day	Mete ŋu nya esia ŋkeke bliboa katã
This is a very surprising thing.	Esia nye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Get them now.	Xɔ wo fifia.
I stand dead on this	Metsi tre ku ɖe esia ŋu
The night before.	Le zã si do ŋgɔ me.
I'm not sure there would have been anything in it	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be naneke anɔ eme hafi o
I hope it never comes	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mava gbeɖe o
And yet here we are.	Eye ke hã míele afisia.
I don’t need to be with someone like him	Mehiã be manɔ ame aɖe abe eya ene gbɔ o
I couldn’t tell them apart	Nyemete ŋu ɖe wo dome o
I just can’t stand it.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu o.
I just think this is a crazy plan	Ðeko mesusu be esia nye ɖoɖo si me susu mele o
I hope you like it this way.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò alea.
I know the most popular searches	Menya didi siwo xɔ ŋkɔ wu
This is a problem.	Esia nye kuxi.
Me and you.	Nye kple wò.
Now that era is almost gone for good.	Fifia ɣeyiɣi ma nu yi kura kloe.
Maybe I could have saved them	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu aɖe wo hafi
I want to play something	Medi be maƒo nane
Everything must be in order.	Ele be nusianu nanɔ ɖoɖo nu.
He was a loser.	Enye ame aɖe si bu.
Here is like anywhere else.	Afisia hã le abe teƒe bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
It will be fine.	Anɔ nyuie.
No one worked harder.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ dɔ sesĩe wu ema o.
And its time constraints are excellent.	Eye eƒe ɣeyiɣi ƒe sesẽ hã nyo ŋutɔ.
I had food and water	Nuɖuɖu kple tsi nɔ asinye
I couldn’t work for days	Nyemete ŋu wɔ dɔ ŋkeke geɖe o
We can see that in the following way.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ema le mɔ si gbɔna nu.
He has not been home the last few days.	Menɔ aƒeme le ŋkeke ʋɛ siwo va yi me o.
That was a difficult task.	Dɔ sesẽ aɖee nye ema.
Some things changed for the better.	Nu aɖewo trɔ va nyo.
I can’t prove that	Nyemate ŋu aɖo kpe nya ma dzi o
I would be ready for it	Anye be manɔ klalo nɛ
I had a pretty good idea of ​​who he was	Amekae wònye la ƒe susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ asinye
I just want to know more about you	Ðeko medi be manya nu geɖe tso ŋuwò
That thought is amazing.	Susu ma wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I was just listening last night	Ðeko menɔ to me tom le zã si va yi me

I can give you anything you want, you know	Mate ŋu ana nusianu si nèdi la wò, ènya
I am sure of that.	Meka ɖe edzi le ema ŋu.
Now, this is more than a while.	Fifia, esia wu ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
A man pointed a gun at my head	Ŋutsu aɖe tsɔ tu aɖe fia asi nye ta
That’s what happened.	Emae nye nusi dzɔ.
Maybe I should apologize	Ðewohĩ ele be maɖe kuku
No one answered him.	Ame aɖeke meɖo eŋu nɛ o.
I am going to retire to my room	Mele dzudzɔ xɔ ge le nye xɔ me
He had plenty of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe nɔ esi.
I can’t imagine what it’s like now.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi wòle fifia le susu me o.
He didn’t seem to have any problems.	Edze abe kuxi aɖeke menɔ eŋu o ene.
Nothing has ever been so easy.	Naneke menɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
I do this every morning	Mewɔa esia ŋdi sia ŋdi
I needed to explain some things to him	Ehiã be maɖe nu aɖewo me nɛ
Maybe he didn’t.	Ðewohĩ mewɔe nenema o.
I didn’t have that	Ema menɔ asinye o
And something hit me.	Eye nane ƒo ɖe menye.
I know he had been depressed	Menya be nu te ɖe edzi kpɔ
I have to do it.	Ele nam be mawɔe.
His own face was hot.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe mo xɔ dzo.
I can talk to him and anything	Mate ŋu aƒo nu kplii kple nusianu
To play a more active role.	Be woawɔ akpa aɖe vevie wu.

Some new techniques.	Aɖaŋu yeye aɖewo.

A wet tongue licked my hand.	Aɖe si ƒo tsi la ƒo nye asi.

But this is a long time.	Gake esia nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
I can’t stay here	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afisia o
I couldn’t go any further	Nyemete ŋu yi ŋgɔ wu ema o
I can do absolutely nothing without it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke kura manɔmee o.
It would be against the law.	Anye nusi tsi tre ɖe se ŋu.
I let my hair down here	Meɖe asi le nye ɖa ŋu le afisia
It was his first project of this kind.	Enye eƒe dɔ sia ƒomevi gbãtɔ.
But it can happen.	Gake ate ŋu adzɔ.
There’s some other stuff in there.	Nu bubu aɖewo hã le afima.
No one saw a car or anyone.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ ʋu alo ame aɖeke o.

I care about these guys	Metsɔ ɖe le ŋutsu siawo me
I can’t handle this right now	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ fifia o
People disappeared when that happened.	Amewo bu esime nu ma dzɔ.
But he couldn’t be sure.	Gake mete ŋu ka ɖe edzi o.
I really want to do the right thing	Medi vevie be mawɔ nu nyui
Two points have stuck with me.	Nya eve aɖewo lé ɖe ŋunye.
Which is impossible, of course.	Nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o ya.
That was in our heads.	Ema nɔ míaƒe ta me.
The house itself seems to be in good shape.	Edze abe aƒea ŋutɔ le nɔnɔme nyui me ene.
Now it is that way.	Fifia ele nenema.
This wasn’t exactly the case.	Esia menɔ alea tututu o.

We just can’t do it.	Ðeko míate ŋui o.
My own side was worried.	Nye ŋutɔ nye akpa dzi tsi dzi.
Everybody is everybody.	Ame sia ame nye ame sia ame.
I touched my hair.	Meka asi nye ɖa ŋu.
It’s not going to happen.	Menye nusi ava dzɔ o.

No one else will be here.	Ame bubu aɖeke manɔ afisia o.
That surprised me a lot	Ema wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
And we don’t know why.	Eye míenya nusi tae o.
I fell hard for all of them	Medze anyi sesĩe ɖe wo katã ta
I think it’s legal.	Mesusu be ele se nu.
But there has to be a reason.	Gake ele be susu aɖe nanɔ anyi.
I remember it now.	Meɖo ŋku edzi fifia.
No one said anything.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
That’s probably because it was all in my head.	Anɔ eme be esi wò katã nɔ ta me tae wòle alea ɖo.
I would like to do something	Madi be mawɔ nane
This happened a few times.	Esia dzɔ zi ʋɛ aɖewo.
Lost in his head.	Bu ɖe eƒe ta me.
Not that he had anything good to do.	Menye be nu nyui aɖe nɔ esi wòawɔ o.
I took off another outfit	Meɖe bubu le awu bubu me
This is personal for you, not me.	Esia nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ na wò, ke menye na nye o.
This requires some work, for the following reason.	Esia bia dɔ aɖewo wɔwɔ, le susu si gbɔna ta.
I asked to see the room.	Mebia be makpɔ xɔa me.
I was clearly missing something	Edze ƒã be nane nɔ to yim nam
What a sight.	Nu kae nye si.
But it’s definitely on me	Ke le ŋunye godoo
Maybe there is no dog.	Ðewohĩ avu aɖeke meli o.

Or at least a first name.	Alo ŋkɔ gbãtɔ ya teti.
I can’t give you advice.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo aɖaŋu na wò o.

I was hoping we could try, you know	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be míate ŋu ate kpɔ, ènya
I really should be here tonight	Ele be manɔ afisia ŋutɔŋutɔ le zã sia me
He had had a rough night.	Zã sesẽ aɖe nɔ eŋu kpɔ.
It’s simple and really really important to me.	Ele bɔbɔe eye wòle vevie nam ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
A big mistake to make	Vodada gã aɖe si wòle be woawɔ
I have a problem with this	Kuxi aɖe le ŋunye le esia ŋu
Which would make things easier.	Nusi ana nuwo nanɔ bɔbɔe wu.

I really can’t answer that	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu aɖo nya ma ŋu o

Not once, not ever.	Menye zi ɖeka o, menye gbeɖe o.

There was no problem.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ anyi o.

Perhaps you are in that situation now.	Ðewohĩ èle nɔnɔme ma me fifia.
But he didn’t believe me.	Gake mexɔ dzinye se o.

I had to spit it out.	Ele nam be maɖe ta ɖe eŋu.
He couldn’t bear it.	Mete ŋu do dzi o.
But there was a problem with it.	Gake kuxi aɖe nɔ eŋu.
I can’t replace him.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ ɖe eteƒe o.

But it would have made me wrong.	Gake anye ne ana mawɔ vodada.

And that’s very exciting	Eye ema doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ
Nothing would surprise him.	Naneke mawɔ nuku nɛ o.

But no one seemed to care.	Gake edze abe ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme o ene.

Very, very bad.	Nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.

He is in a very difficult place.	Ele teƒe sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.

I always have more to do.	Nu geɖe wu nɔa asinye mawɔ ɣesiaɣi.
Another man came out.	Ŋutsu bubu aɖe hã do go.
That could be a problem for him.	Ema ate ŋu anye kuxi nɛ.
But they have money.	Gake ga le wo si.
But I’m not sure	Gake nyemeka ɖe edzi o
Every word still matters.	Nya ɖesiaɖe gakpɔtɔ le vevie.
I need to find out how that got there	Ele be madi alesi ema va ɖo afima
I just wanted to relax	Ðeko medi be maɖe dzi ɖi
He needed some air.	Ehiã ya aɖe.
It’s been a while.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
I think time is like that	Mesusu be ɣeyiɣi le nenema
But it’s a loss for just about everyone else.	Gake enye nusi bu na ame bubu ɖesiaɖe kloe.
Maybe I should have expected it	Ðewohĩ ɖe wòle be makpɔ mɔ nɛ hafi
I stood up for a moment.	Metsi tre vie.
And just for the money.	Eye ɖe ga ta ko.
That didn’t work either.	Ema hã mewɔ dɔ o.
I don’t think anyone should have to live like that.	Nyemesusu be ele be ame aɖeke nanɔ agbe nenema o.
I have enough for me.	Nusi sɔ gbɔ nam le asinye.
I really don’t know what they want	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi dim wole o
I wanted to let go of everything	Medi be maɖe asi le nusianu ŋu
Now think about your tongue.	Azɔ bu wò aɖe ŋu.
It is working today.	Ele dɔ wɔm egbea.
I'm still working on it.	Megale dɔ wɔm tso eŋu kokoko.
I wanted to see what they were doing	Medi be makpɔ nusi wɔm wole
He couldn't speak either.	Eya hã mete ŋu ƒo nu o.
I didn’t see much after that	Nyemekpɔ nu boo aɖeke le ema megbe o
I was kind of impressed that I liked it.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye le mɔ aɖe nu be edzɔ dzi nam.
That and its great.	Ema kple eƒe nu gã la.
I want to come and see you	Medi be mava kpɔ wò
I was very impressed with him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I really wanted to meet them	Medi vevie be mado go wo
I knew his voice so well.	Menya eƒe gbe nyuie ale gbegbe.
I needed to do that for me	Ehiã be mawɔ ema nam
I told you that yesterday	Megblɔ nya ma na mi etsɔ
I felt almost nothing	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be naneke mese le ɖokuinye me kloe o
Everyone said it made sense.	Amesiame gblɔ be susu le eme.
A reality he can step into.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe si me wòate ŋu aɖo afɔ nu ɖo.
He had no idea what that would cost.	Menya nusi ema axɔ o.
I know you have something else	Menya be nu bubu aɖe le ŋuwò
I want to continue to address that	Medi be mayi edzi akpɔ nya ma gbɔ
I was able to forget all the things I had to do	Mete ŋu ŋlɔ nu siwo katã wòle be mawɔ la be
I don’t need to know that	Mehiã be manya nya ma o
It’s been a long day.	Ŋkeke didi aɖee nye esia.
I know things seem too good to be true	Menya be edze abe nuwo nyo akpa ene
No reason is too small.	Susu aɖeke mele sue akpa o.
In any case.	Le nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe me.
It’s not working.	Menye ɖe wòle dɔ wɔm o.
No one ever knew what he was doing.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi wɔm wòle gbeɖe o.
There are other parallels.	Nu bubu siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo hã li.
I had everything and nothing at the same time	Nusianu nɔ asinye eye naneke menɔ asinye le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me o
Where it doesn’t matter.	Afi kae mehiã o.
In fact, the opposite is likely to happen.	Le nyateƒe me la, anɔ eme be nusi to vovo na ema adzɔ.
But you are the first.	Gake wòe nye ame gbãtɔ.
He didn’t stay in his tracks.	Metsi eƒe mɔ dzi o.
I hope this helps you	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia akpe ɖe ŋuwò
I understand it.	Mese egɔme.
You can’t control your anger.	Màte ŋu aɖu wò dziku dzi o.
Can you handle that for me ?.	Àte ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ nam ?.
And it’s the wrong thing to do	Eye enye nu gbegblẽ si woawɔ
It will help us a lot.	Akpe ɖe mía ŋu ŋutɔ.
That’s better than nothing.	Ema nyo wu be naneke manɔ anyi o.
What is beautiful is true.	Nusi nya kpɔ ŋutɔ la nye nyateƒe.
It would be someone else for him.	Anye ame bubu aɖe nɛ.
You gave us that.	Wòe tsɔ ema na mí.
I recognized that face	Mekpɔ mo ma dze sii
I really wanted to knock them out.	Medi vevie be maƒo wo ɖa.
I did understand it.	Mese egɔme nyateƒe.
I tried to encourage him.	Medze agbagba de dzi ƒo nɛ.
He didn’t do that, of course.	Mewɔe nenema o ya.
He seems to be in good shape.	Edze abe ele nɔnɔme nyui aɖe me ene.
And of course, it could have been any of us.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ate ŋu anye mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe hafi.
I wondered if something had happened	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe nane dzɔ hã
That would be great.	Ema anyo ŋutɔ.
Talk to him about it.	Ƒo nu kplii.
They may or may not have a due date.	Ðewohĩ ŋkeke si dzi woawɔ dɔa nanɔ wo si alo manɔ anyi o.
Why? 	Nu ka ta?
I don’t know anything.	Nyemenya naneke o.
But I think he was one of us	Gake mesusu be mía dometɔ ɖekae wònye
I can’t explain what you did to me	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nu si nèwɔ nam la me o
A long summer awaited	Dzomeŋɔli didi aɖe nɔ lalam
OH! 	O!
I didn’t see them clearly.	Nyemekpɔ wo nyuie o.
And of course, we’ve known about it for quite some time.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, míenya nu tso eŋu ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
There’s just so much that people don’t know.	Ðeko nu geɖe ŋutɔ li siwo amewo menya o.
Hours and hours every night.	Gaƒoƒo kple gaƒoƒo zã sia zã.
His attention is focused on me.	Eƒe susu nɔa ŋunye.
Just do whatever works for you.	Ðeko nàwɔ nusianu si awɔ dɔ na wò.
None of them are true.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
The money was gone, and his job was gone.	Ga la nu yi, eye eƒe dɔa nu tso.
Not at least he is.	Menye eya ya teti o.
I couldn’t figure out what they were doing there.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi wɔm wole le afima o.
It makes sense to him now.	Susu le eme nɛ fifia.
I want so much more than this	Medi nu geɖe ŋutɔ wu esia
I was too nervous to eat anything	Metsi dzodzodzoe akpa be nyemate ŋu aɖu naneke o
Clearly, two people can do more than one.	Edze ƒã be ame eve ate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe wu ame ɖeka.
If anything, things could go in the opposite direction.	Ne nane li la, ke nuwo ate ŋu azɔ mɔ si to vovo na ema.
I had to find another way.	Ele be madi mɔ bubu aɖe.
I have seen them myself	Nye ŋutɔ mekpɔ wo
Have a nice night.	Zã ƒe nyuie.
It didn’t make sense to me, any of it.	Susu menɔ eme nam o, wo dometɔ aɖeke.
I don’t want to see anything else	Nyemedi be makpɔ nu bubu aɖeke o
A word that gave it a name	Nya aɖe si tsɔ ŋkɔ nɛ
There were people here too.	Amewo nɔ anyi le afisia hã.
I am looking forward to it	Mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie
I want a better life	Medi be agbe si nyo wu nanɔ asinye
Just to try things out.	Be mate nuwo kpɔ ko.
But how often can that happen anyway.	Gake zi nenie wòate ŋu adzɔ nenema le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Everything became easier.	Nusianu va nɔ bɔbɔe.
That seems reasonable enough.	Edze abe susu le nya ma me ale gbegbe ene.
Look, it’s so simple.	Kpɔ ɖa, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
It could finally be him.	Ate ŋu anye eya ŋutɔ mlɔeba.
At any given time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe me.
There was a fire.	Dzo aɖe nɔ anyi.
Not on any of them.	Menye le wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o.
I didn’t understand everything	Nyemese nusianu gɔme o
It all depends on what you are trying to achieve.	Nusianu nɔ te ɖe nusi gbɔ nèle agbagba dzem be yeawɔ dzi.
I would have been surprised	Anye ne ewɔ nuku nam hafi
I'm still looking for help here.	Megale kpekpeɖeŋu dim le afisia kokoko.
But I can’t get more involved than this	Gake nyemate ŋu aƒo ɖokuinye ɖe eme wu nya sia o
He is not eating.	Menye nu ɖum wòle o.
He had a very neck.	Kɔ nɔ eŋu ŋutɔ.
I can’t tell you all this	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya siawo katã na wò o
I just couldn’t face that	Ðeko nyemete ŋu dze ŋgɔ ema o
I hope you are doing well.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be èle edzi dzem nyuie.
I really wanted to see everything.	Medi vevie be makpɔ nusianu.
In the room.	Le xɔa me.
I want to talk to him	Medi be maƒo nu kplii
I never knew what he did	Nyemenya nusi wòwɔ kpɔ o
Be careful in these difficult times.	Kpɔ nyuie le ɣeyiɣi sesẽ siawo me.
Which is above all good.	Nusi de ŋgɔ wu nusianu si nyo.
I am the one who has left	Nyee nye ame si dzo
I couldn’t fight it.	Nyemete ŋu wɔ avu kplii o.
Only once.	Zi ɖeka koe.
I think there’s something going on behind the scenes	Mesusu be nane le edzi yim le megbe
There is only the word.	Nya la koe li.
I remember doing this before.	Meɖo ŋku edzi be mewɔ esia va yi.
That’s a very interesting thing.	Ema nye nusi dzɔa dzi na ame ŋutɔ.
Something he had	Nu aɖe si nɔ esi
I will tell you something now	Magblɔ nya aɖe na mi azɔ
What they have here will last a long time.	Nusi le wo si le afisia anɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
You have no idea.	Susu aɖeke mele asiwò o.
We are practical people.	Míenye ame siwo wɔa dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I wasn’t happy or angry	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ alo do dziku o
I could have done more for you	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe na wò hafi
Another voice, another, more .	Gbe bubu kpe ɖe eŋu, bubu, geɖe wu .
It is both the thing itself and the nature of the thing.	Enye nu la ŋutɔ kple nu la ƒe nɔnɔme siaa.
People ran with it.	Amewo ƒu du kplii.
I remember it hit me	Meɖo ŋku edzi be edze dzinye
He couldn’t escape.	Mete ŋu si dzo o.
The logic worked.	Susu si le eme la wɔ dɔ.
The state of mind.	Susu ƒe nɔnɔme.
Only one thing is wrong.	Nu ɖeka koe gblẽ.
But not in my case.	Gake menye le nye nya nu o.
And the location of course.	Eye teƒe si wòle ya.
It is no longer the case.	Megale nenema o.
That should be there.	Ele be ema nanɔ afima.
I don’t know who he is	Nyemenya amesi wònye o
There are four parts to this process.	Akpa ene ye le ɖoɖo sia me.
Everything was going well.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie.
I still can’t believe what just happened.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi dzɔ teti koe nye ema dzi kokoko o.
Everything about her became exciting.	Nusianu si ku ɖe eŋu la va nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm nɛ.
I knew that wasn’t the gun	Menya be menye emae nye tu la o
Not too many people.	Menye ame geɖe akpa o.
I certainly used to be	Menɔ nenema tsã godoo
That money is nothing.	Ga ma menye naneke o.
He couldn’t help it.	Mete ŋu kpe ɖe eŋu o.
Was a very bad idea.	Nye susu gbegblẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
I still can’t figure out what it is	Nyemete ŋu kpɔa nusi wònye la dze sii haɖe o
These two men have known each other for a long time.	Ŋutsu eve siawo nya wo nɔewo ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
I hope you keep this in mind	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia nanɔ susu me na wò
But consider another aspect.	Gake bu akpa bubu aɖe ŋu kpɔ.
He could never do it.	Mate ŋu awɔe gbeɖe o.
I have to say something.	Ele nam be magblɔ nya aɖe.
I gave him one, you gave him one	Metsɔ ɖeka nɛ, wòe tsɔ ɖeka nɛ
Or on a dog.	Alo le avu aɖe dzi.
How does a man like this keep things in check?.	Aleke ŋutsu si le abe esia ene la nɔa nuwo dzi kpɔm?.
You know what a good market is.	Ènya nusi asi nyui nye.
We can work together.	Míate ŋu awɔ dɔ ɖekae.
All of these opportunities are very new to you.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ siawo katã nye nu yeye na wò ŋutɔ.
I was anything but relaxed	Nyee nye nusianu gake meɖe dzi ɖi o
This is so very different.	Esia to vovo kura ale gbegbe.
Not on your life.	Menye ɖe wò agbe dzi o.
In the car.	Le ʋua me.
He will know everything.	Anya nusianu.
But look at the reality.	Gake kpɔ ale si nuwo le la ɖa.
I think you could have done something	Mesusu be àte ŋu awɔ nane hafi
People do not treat others well for no reason.	Amewo mewɔa nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu nyuie le susu aɖeke ta o.
I didn’t feel like I had anything left	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be naneke megale ŋunye o
I want.	Medi.
That’s my biggest concern.	Emae nye nusi ŋu metsi dzi ɖo wu.
That doesn’t matter now.	Ema mele vevie fifia o.
I have no problem with it	Kuxi aɖeke mele ŋunye le eŋu o
If that’s you, know this.	Ne wòe nye ema la, ke nya esia.
I don’t want to let go	Nyemedi be maɖe asi le eŋu o
I have too much to do for that	Nu geɖe akpa le asinye mawɔ ɖe ema ta
A small part that continues	Akpa sue aɖe si yi edzi
You’re just hoping.	Ðeko nèle mɔ kpɔm.
But there is no reason for it.	Gake susu aɖeke meli si tae o.
We hope you enjoy it.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò.
I was so out of it today	Medo le eme ale gbegbe egbea
I remember being like that	Meɖo ŋku edzi be menɔ nenema
Now your project begins.	Fifia wò dɔa dze egɔme.
He had been attracted to everyone.	Amesiame ƒe nu lé dzi nɛ kpɔ.
But it could have been good.	Gake ate ŋu anyo hafi.
But it won’t do you any good.	Gake maɖe vi aɖeke na wò o.
Police lingered nearby	Kpovitɔwo nɔ anyi didi le teƒe si te ɖe afima ŋu
I made an appointment to meet	Meɖo ɣeyiɣi aɖe ɖi be mado go
You can’t go on like this.	Màte ŋu ayi edzi alea o.
A while has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe va yi.
I also had to protect myself	Ele be makpɔ ɖokuinye hã ta
I know you probably know this	Menya be ɖewohĩ ènya esia
I had to let go of it.	Ele nam be maɖe asi le eŋu.
They’re in there.	Wole eme le afima.
I gave you everything	Metsɔ nusianu na wò
It never occurred to any of us.	Meva susu me na mía dometɔ aɖeke kpɔ o.
There are at least two reasons for this.	Susu eve ya teti tae wòle nenema ɖo.
But this is a bit more work.	Gake esia nye dɔ si wòle be woawɔ vie wu.
More than once.	Nu geɖe wu zi ɖeka.
A little piece of my heart split at his word	Nye dzi ƒe akpa sue aɖe ma le eƒe nya la ta
I can’t make anything work	Nyemate ŋu ana naneke nawɔ dɔ o
I have so much to do tomorrow	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye mawɔ etsɔ
You can see just as much.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe nenema ke.
There can only be one person.	Ame ɖeka koe ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
It could be years.	Ate ŋu anye ƒe geɖe.
I don’t want to be like that	Nyemedi be manɔ nenema o
You have to have help.	Ele be kpekpeɖeŋu nanɔ asiwò.
I lived in this city all this time	Menɔ du sia me le ɣeyiɣi sia katã me
One person did not say where they lived.	Ame ɖeka megblɔ afisi wole o.
And another, more than	Eye bubu, si wu .
But it’s not that much.	Gake menye nenema gbegbe o.
But not much.	Gake menye nu geɖe o.
Actually, I came to ask you a question	Le nyateƒe me la, meva bia nya aɖe wò
I could go on and on about this strategy	Mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ nu ƒom tso aɖaŋu sia ŋu
Product.	Nusi wòwɔ.

Like a lot of things.	Abe nu geɖe ene.
It’s not a bit late or are you	Metsi megbe vie o alo menye wòe oa
Now this year is different.	Fifia ƒe sia to vovo.
I was in a great mood this morning.	Menɔ nɔnɔme gã aɖe me ŋdi sia.
I hope you do that	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nàwɔ nu nenema
I know what it’s like	Menya alesi wòle
And something else.	Eye nu bubu hã.
Everything was exactly the same.	Nusianu nɔ nenema tututu.
He seems like a great guy with a great mind.	Edze abe ŋutsu gã aɖe si si susu gã aɖe le ene.
I want to continue to be a man	Medi be mayi edzi anye ŋutsu
I want him to keep his word	Medi be wòawɔ ɖe eƒe nya dzi
Now, let me be very consistent here.	Azɔ, mina mawɔ nu ɖekae ŋutɔ le afisia.
But today, it doesn’t matter.	Gake egbea la, mehiã o.
It was just too soon	Ðeko wòwɔ kaba akpa
I can’t fight it or get away from it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ avu kplii alo asi le eŋu o.
In the latter.	Le mamlɛtɔ me.
And that trend continues.	Eye nɔnɔme ma yi edzi.
I can’t tell you exactly why	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusita tututu na wò o
It was kind of weird.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku ƒomevi aɖe.
I hardly touched the edge	Nyemeka asi eƒe go ŋu kura o
Great support from everyone.	Kpekpeɖeŋu gã aɖe tso amesiame gbɔ.
I was hoping to spend a night with them	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be manɔ wo gbɔ zã ɖeka
I think he really couldn’t talk	Mesusu be le nyateƒe me la, mete ŋu ƒoa nu o
I am together in my work.	Mele ɖekae le nye dɔa me.
His hand was hot.	Eƒe asi xɔ dzo.
It finally happened.	Edzɔ mlɔeba.
A bullet touched him	Tu aɖe ka asi eŋu
I couldn’t stop to find out	Nyemete ŋu tɔ be mava nya o
They all work well together.	Wo katã wɔa dɔ nyuie.
I can do it alone	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔe
I know we don’t have the money	Menya be ga la mele mía si o
I thought my life was over	Mesusu be nye agbe wu enu
I’m not really sure about that.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi ŋutɔŋutɔ le ema ŋu o.
We know, we know.	Míenya, míenya.
I was nowhere near there	Nyemete ɖe afima ŋu le afi aɖeke o
If not for a long time.	Ne menye ɣeyiɣi didi o la.
I fell for this too	Nye hã medze esia dzi
I wanted to know so much more	Medi be manya nu geɖe ŋutɔ
But I don’t recognize you	Gake nyemekpɔ wò dze sii o
I really like the idea behind what you have here	Susu si le megbe na nusi le asiwò le afisia la dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
Always be on the lookout.	Nɔ nu dim ɣesiaɣi.
I am currently on one.	Mele ɖeka dzi fifia.
But I’m not sure.	Gake nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
I hope he does that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔe nenema.
I already know what your job is	Menya nusi wò dɔ nye xoxo
I needed help, but there was none	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu, gake ɖeke menɔ anyi o
I remember that day so well	Meɖo ŋku ŋkeke ma dzi nyuie ale gbegbe
People rarely do this.	Ƒã hafi amewo wɔa esia.
For this reason,.	Le susu sia ta la,...
I will always be home alone	Nye ɖeka manɔ aƒeme ɣesiaɣi
I couldn’t stand it at all	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu kura o
I never heard of you	Nyemese wò ŋkɔ kpɔ o
But he still didn’t understand.	Gake mese egɔme kokoko o.
No one understood it	Ame aɖeke mese egɔme o
I did the same thing	Nye hã mewɔ nu nenema ke
I came across something that might interest you	Meva ke ɖe nane si me ɖewohĩ adzɔ dzi na wò ŋu
Maybe he can do it now.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu awɔe fifia.
I needed to know what was going on inside	Ehiã be manya nusi nɔ edzi yim le eme
I was very confident in myself.	Meka ɖe ɖokuinye dzi ŋutɔ.
I don’t want to go without you.	Nyemedi be mayi wò manɔmee o.

But in this case, there was another reason.	Gake le go sia me la, susu bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
I don't really have anything to say in it	Nya aɖeke mele asinye ŋutɔŋutɔ magblɔ le eme o
I know he will take care of this	Menya be akpɔ esia gbɔ
A name that will last for two thousand years.	Ŋkɔ si anɔ anyi ƒe akpe eve.
I think you know what it’s like	Mesusu be ènya alesi wòle
That’s totally fine though.	Ema nyo kura gake.
A bad day is anything else	Ŋkeke gbegblẽ nye nu bubu ɖesiaɖe
I had never heard of it.	Nyemese eŋu nya kpɔ o.
This is not just for legal reasons.	Menye nya siwo le se nu ta koe esia dzɔ ɖo o.
Look for something in it.	Di nu le eme.
You know what you did.	Ènya nu si nèwɔ.
I still can’t do it.	Nyemate ŋui kokoko o.

I decided to try it too	Meɖoe be mate eya hã kpɔ
I am not and cannot be	Nyemele nenema o eye nyemate ŋu anɔ nenema hã o
I would have preferred death	Anye ne ku anyo nam wu

It was a very bad thing.	Enye nu gbegblẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can’t escape death	Nyemate ŋu asi le ku nu o
I never saw myself that way	Nyemekpɔ ɖokuinye nenema kpɔ o
I know my dog ​​did.	Menya be nye avu wɔe nenema.
But it’s very rare these days.	Gake ƒã ŋutɔ le ŋkeke siawo me.

I can’t allow that	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ nenema o
I can never get away from this	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eɖokui ɖa le esia me gbeɖe o
I had no idea he had escaped	Nyemenya kura be esi o
Many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe.

I felt something change in me	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nane trɔ le menye

And that’s good enough.	Eye ema nyo ale gbegbe.

I have a lot to say about that book	Nya geɖe le asinye magblɔ tso agbalẽ ma ŋu
I had never heard of them	Nyemese wo ŋkɔ kpɔ o
Don’t be ready for me.	Nɔ klalo nam.
I know exactly why	Menya nusi tututu tae
I was hoping money would help	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be ga akpe ɖe ŋunye
But I had to try something	Gake ele nam be mate nane kpɔ
What is true is true and what is false is false.	Nusi nye nyateƒe nye nyateƒe eye nusi nye alakpa nye alakpa.
The wet clothes.	Awu siwo me tsi le la.
But things didn’t start well.	Gake nuwo dze egɔme nyuie o.
There’s something there for everyone.	Nane le afima na amesiame.
I am very demanding	Mebiaa nu geɖe ŋutɔ
I made time for it.	Mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi ɖe eŋu.
He’s comfortable here.	Eƒe dzi dze eme le afisia.
I can’t imagine what you’re going through	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi me tom nèle la le susu me o
The people there are completely divided.	Ame siwo le afi ma la ma kura.
I’ve seen you struggle	Mekpɔ wò le avu wɔm
Thank you for your attention.	Akpe na wò ɖe wò susu ta.
He responded with his mouth.	Etsɔ eƒe nu ɖo eŋu.
I got them.	Mexɔ wo.
I tried to save his life	Medze agbagba be maɖe eƒe agbe
He tried to make a life here.	Edze agbagba be yeawɔ agbe le afisia.
It’s necessary.	Ehiã.
I’ve never felt that way before.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o.
The same rule applies to food.	Se ma ke ku ɖe nuɖuɖu ŋu.
But this isn’t working.	Gake esia mele dɔ wɔm o.
I hope he does his job well	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔ eƒe dɔa nyuie
I knew absolutely nothing about it.	Nyemenya naneke kura tso eŋu o.
I remember the night before	Meɖo ŋku zã si do ŋgɔ me dzi
I saw how he struggled	Mekpɔ alesi wònɔ avu wɔm
In the present case, none of these factors exist.	Le nya si me míele fifia me la, nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
I didn’t expect so many	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na ame geɖe nenema gbegbe o
But in a sense, they were discouraged.	Gake le go aɖe me la, dzi ɖe le wo ƒo.
But he has it.	Gake ele esi.
Things have definitely changed.	Nuwo trɔ godoo.
He was so attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ale gbegbe.
I don’t know what to make of tonight	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ le zã sia ŋu o
He seemed surprised.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ ene.
It’s definitely easier to plan.	Ele bɔbɔe wu godoo be woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
We knew there were issues with the car.	Míenya be nya aɖewo le ʋua ŋu.
I know where he is	Menya afisi wòle
That none of them exist.	Be wo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
There is a man on it.	Ŋutsu aɖe le edzi.
I have to relax	Ele be maɖe dzi ɖi
I was worried about what had happened to him	Metsi dzi ɖe nusi va dzɔ ɖe edzi ŋu
I had no idea what was going on in his life	Nyemenya nusi nɔ edzi yim le eƒe agbe me o
I had a few other things on my mind	Nu ʋɛ bubu aɖewo hã nɔ susu me nam
I hope they are alive	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wole agbe
You, a child.	Wò, ɖevi aɖe.
I wasn’t going to let it go	Menye ɖe meɖoe be maɖe asi le eŋu o
Look at what they are doing.	Kpɔ nusi wɔm wole la ɖa.
Perhaps the same is true here.	Ðewohĩ nenema ke wòle le afisia hã.
Use only one location throughout.	Zã teƒe ɖeka ko le ɣeyiɣi bliboa me.
He never did anything.	Mewɔ naneke kpɔ o.
Mava o.	Mava o.
I know what you have in mind.	Menya nusi le susu me na wò.
Not sure if you know that.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be ènya nya ma o.
I know a new teacher is coming but you	Menya be nufiala yeye aɖe gbɔna gake wò ŋutɔ
The truth is so amazing.	Nyateƒea wɔ nuku ale gbegbe.
I will tell you about everything	Maƒo nu tso nusianu ŋu na wò
Whether or not it will happen is another matter.	Ne adzɔ alo mawɔe o, nye nya bubu.
I glanced at him too	Meɖe ŋku ɖe eya hã ŋu
Today, tomorrow, next week.	Egbea, etsɔ, kwasiɖa si gbɔna.
I should never find out	Mele be mava nya gbeɖe o
He looked good tonight.	Edze nyuie le zã sia me.
He is working on	Ele dɔ dzi le .
I let go of his hand	Meɖe asi le eƒe asi ŋu
I can’t be with anyone	Nyemate ŋu anɔ ame aɖeke gbɔ o
I want to play something	Medi be maƒo nane
But that’s pretty much it.	Gake ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
But he couldn’t try.	Gake mete ŋu dze agbagba o.
And that’s very important here.	Eye esia le vevie ŋutɔ le afisia.
I have plenty of time	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe le asinye
That’s a good news.	Nya nyui aɖee.
This is very difficult.	Esia sesẽ ŋutɔ.
That so few could have done so much.	Be ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe ate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe alea hafi.
I know enough to say	Menya nya siwo sɔ gbɔ be magblɔ
A day or a week is fine, accordingly.	Ŋkeke ɖeka alo kwasiɖa ɖeka nyo, le esia nu.
After all, if not now, when?.	Le nyateƒe me la, ne menye fifia o la, ɣekaɣie?.
It’s not a long story today.	Menye nya didi aɖee wònye egbea o.
I took in some much needed air	Mexɔ ya aɖe si hiã vevie la ɖe eme
That’s what’s really hard.	Emae nye nu si sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I'm still mad at him.	Megale dziku dom ɖe eŋu kokoko.
I could hear his voice.	Mete ŋu se eƒe gbe.
He can’t stand that.	Mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe ema nu o.
I did what I had to do.	Mewɔ nu si wòle be mawɔ.
Will someone tell me what to do.	Ðe ame aɖe agblɔ nusi mawɔ nam.
A little food for the days to come	Nuɖuɖu vi aɖe na ŋkeke siwo gbɔna
Put that aside.	Tsɔ nya ma da ɖi.
He didn’t know anything.	Menya naneke o.
There were some who did.	Ame aɖewo nɔ anyi siwo wɔe nenema.
It was weird, but it worked.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, gake ewɔ dɔ.
That’s what interested him.	Emae nye nusi do dzidzɔ nɛ.
But it most likely won’t be that easy.	Gake anɔ eme wu be manɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
Stop what you’re doing.	Dzudzɔ nusi wɔm nèle.
I am not so sure about this	Nyemeka ɖe esia dzi nenema gbegbe o
What works in one situation may not necessarily work in another.	Ðewohĩ nusi wɔa dɔ le nɔnɔme aɖe me mawɔ dɔ le nɔnɔme bubu me kokoko o.
I watched his face as he worked	Menɔ eƒe mo kpɔm esime wònɔ dɔ wɔm
He had a bad day’s work behind him.	Ŋkeke gbegblẽ aɖe ƒe dɔ nɔ megbe nɛ.
I had plenty of time	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe nɔ asinye
Tell them that.	Gblɔ nya ma na wo.
I felt so close to him	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mete ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe
I just couldn’t stop after that	Ðeko nyemete ŋu tɔ le ema megbe o
I could guess what he was seeing	Mete ŋu bu nusi kpɔm wònɔ la ɖi
Now our people know you.	Fifia míaƒe amewo nya wò.
I have never been able to do that	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nu ma kpɔ o
I decided to keep talking.	Meɖoe be mayi edzi anɔ nu ƒom.
He was just a good guy.	Ame nyui aɖe koe wònye.
I want to get rid of them	Medi be maɖe wo ɖa
Get them now.	Xɔ wo fifia.
I don’t want to go anywhere else.	Nyemedi be mayi teƒe bubu aɖeke o.
I am not a single person.	Menye ame ɖeka.
More thinking and focusing on you today.	Wò ŋu bubu kple wò susu geɖe wu egbea.
I am so glad to see here	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mekpɔ afisia
I can live with that though	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe kple ema gake
I could never figure this out	Nyemete ŋu nya esia gbeɖe o
I wanted something small, but not too small	Medi nane si le sue, gake menye nu sue akpa o
I want to stay home with you	Medi be manɔ aƒeme kpli wò
That was a long time.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
I think it’s true	Mesusu be enye nyateƒe
I have never been able to eat anything.	Nyemete ŋu ɖu naneke kpɔ o.
I have to tell you this	Ele be magblɔ nya sia na mi
Ask some questions.	Bia nya aɖewo.
A few things that should have been done differently	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo siwo wòle be woawɔ le mɔ bubu nu hafi
That sounds weird, actually.	Ema ɖi nusi mewɔ nuku o, le nyateƒe me.
But nothing has come of it so far.	Gake naneke medo tso eme vaseɖe fifia o.
He couldn’t see anything.	Mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
I think it could come in handy	Mesusu be ate ŋu ava ɖe vi
Work with people.	Wɔ dɔ kple amewo.
I just want to see things for myself	Ðeko medi be nye ŋutɔ makpɔ nuwo
I think that was very useful.	Mesusu be ema ɖe vi ŋutɔ.
I had only one thing now	Nu ɖeka koe nɔ asinye fifia
I’m not going to kill them.	Nyemele wo wu ge o.
I can definitely work with this now	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ kple esia godoo fifia
I didn’t know he was in this town.	Nyemenya be ele du sia me o.
Now you can hear them.	Fifia àte ŋu ase wo.
In fact, pretty much everything.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusianu kloe.
I can’t be dealing with this right now	Nyemate ŋu anɔ nu wɔm kple esia fifia o
He just did his part for her.	Ðeko wòwɔ eƒe akpa dzi nɛ ko.
There are few exceptions to this rule.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe to vovo na se sia.
I see nothing wrong with that	Nyemekpɔ naneke si gblẽ le ema ŋu o
It’s a really good shot.	Enye tu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It seemed very impressive.	Edze abe ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ ene.
Truth doesn’t matter.	Nyateƒe mele vevie o.
And that’s pretty much all of it.	Eye emae nye wo katã kloe.
And so did everyone else here.	Eye ame bubu ɖesiaɖe si le afisia hã wɔ nenema ke.
I did, a long time ago	Mewɔe, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia
I really liked his attitude.	Eƒe nɔnɔme dze ŋunye ŋutɔ.
I never imagined any of them	Nyemekpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke le susu me kpɔ o
I couldn’t have been better	Nyemate ŋu anyo wu ema o
He can save himself.	Ate ŋu aɖe eɖokui.
I know you’re doing something	Menya be èle nane wɔm
I know something is wrong now	Menya be nane gblẽ fifia
I should have been in my car already	Ðe wòle be manɔ nye ʋua me xoxo hafi
But, now look a little closer.	Gake, azɔ lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie vie.
It doesn’t do anything at all.	Mewɔa naneke kura o.
That sounds like that.	Nya ma ɖi nenema.
I need someone like you	Mehiã ame aɖe abe wò ene
I can only sit there for so long.	Ɣeyiɣi didi ma gbegbe koe mate ŋu anɔ anyi ɖe afima.
Two heads are usually better than one.	Zi geɖe la, ta eve nyo wu ɖeka.
Not sure where here is	Nyemeka ɖe afi si afisia le dzi o
That’s why it’s not necessary.	Esia tae mehiã o ɖo.
I couldn’t think of them.	Nyemete ŋu bu wo ŋu o.
I was the only kid there	Nye ɖeka koe nye ɖevi si nɔ afima
And after that, too.	Eye le ema megbe hã.
We are together now.	Míele ɖekae fifia.
It’s kind of normal.	Enye nusi sɔ ƒomevi aɖe.
I had to find out what happened	Ele nam be madi nusi dzɔ
I can always reach them that way	Mate ŋu aɖo wo gbɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi
Now it’s probably not possible.	Fifia anɔ eme be manya wɔ o.
The plaintiff took the lead.	Ame si tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu la xɔ ŋgɔ.
I wanted to know what was going on	Medi be manya nu si nɔ edzi yim
I didn’t expect him to	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be awɔe nenema o
I picked too much, maybe.	Meɖe nu geɖe akpa, ɖewohĩ.
I wondered what was wrong with me	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae le fu ɖem nam hã
It won’t work anyway.	Mawɔ dɔ le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I didn’t know they would	Nyemenya be woawɔ nu nenema o
I was too old for that	Metsi akpa na ema
I never knew about this.	Nyemenya nu tso esia ŋu kpɔ o.
But cook them.	Gake ɖa wo.
Me and you.	Nye kple wò.
He didn't hear anything.	Mese naneke o.
I will make the necessary arrangements	Mawɔ ɖoɖo siwo hiã
I can’t do anything for them	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke na wo o
I was actually quite impressed.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
But he wasn’t busy.	Gake vovo menɔ eŋu o.
I was in the car	Menɔ ʋua me
I want to see you soon	Medi be mava kpɔ wò kpuie
I have to work tonight anyway	Ele nam be mawɔ dɔ le zã sia me le mɔ sia mɔ nu
And today pretty much everything is over.	Eye egbea la, nusianu kloe wu enu.
I used to feel it	Mese le ɖokuinye me tsã
Give herself to a man.	Tsɔ eɖokui na ŋutsu aɖe.
He was not in the room.	Menɔ xɔa me o.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
I want to know your name	Medi be manya wò ŋkɔ
I just have to be ready for them	Ðeko wòle be manɔ klalo na wo
This was very upsetting to me	Esia te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
On the la.	Le la ŋu.
I did feel something was wrong	Mese le ɖokuinye me nyateƒe be nane gblẽ
I can’t go out with what’s going on	Nyemate ŋu ado go kple nusi le edzi yim o
Please come this way.	Meɖe kuku, va mɔ sia dzi.
I don’t know what’s going to happen	Nyemenya nusi adzɔ o
That is the possibility.	Emae nye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ.
I don’t know this place or these other people	Nyemenya teƒe sia alo ame bubu siawo o
That’s a different thing.	Ema nye nusi to vovo.
I have so much in my life	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye le nye agbe me
But not a small part of it.	Gake menye eƒe akpa sue aɖe o.
But none of them came.	Gake ɖeke meva o.
They were very interesting to me	Wo do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
If only that were true.	Ne ɖe nya ma nye nyateƒe.
I made that mistake once	Mewɔ vodada ma zi ɖeka
Hand in hand.	Asi le asi me.
It’s my imagination now.	Enye nye susu me tɔ fifia.
I needed to do something	Ehiã be mawɔ nane
I knew there wasn’t much he could do	Menya be nu geɖe meli wòate ŋu awɔ o
I had something more important in mind.	Nane si le vevie wu la nɔ susu me nam.
This place makes no sense.	Susu aɖeke mele teƒe sia ŋu o.
I can’t remember them all	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku wo katã dzi o
As if he were a king.	Abe ɖe wònye fia ene.
That’s what’s going through my head.	Emae nye nusi le to yim to nye ta me.
He will never know.	Manya gbeɖe o.
I wasn’t sure what to say.	Nyemeka ɖe nya si magblɔ dzi o.
But he had to act quickly.	Gake ele nɛ be wòawɔ nu kaba.
I will get to know myself better	Mava nya ɖokuinye nyuie wu
I just couldn’t do it	Ðeko nyemete ŋu wɔe o
Today is a house.	Egbea nye aƒe aɖe.
Never without it.	Menye ema manɔmee gbeɖe o.
I needed to talk to his teacher	Ehiã be maƒo nu kple eƒe nufiala
I have heard enough.	Mese nya si sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
They are all fine.	Wo katã wole nyuie.
I just thought it was you	Ðeko mesusu be wòe
Someone was here.	Ame aɖe nɔ afisia.
But it is not in this case.	Gake mele nya sia me o.
I hope you can help me.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
We have no idea about that.	Susu aɖeke mele mía si le ema ŋu o.
I'm fine if he's here.	Mele nyuie ne ele afisia.
They’re all here.	Wo katã wole afisia.
It was a nice time in the afternoon.	Enye ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe le ŋdɔ me.
And everything was really great.	Eye nusianu nyo ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I shouldn’t have anything to do with you yet	Mele be mawɔ naneke kpli wò haɖe o
I couldn’t let anyone near me.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe mɔ ame aɖeke te ɖe ŋunye o.
I was going to tell him about you.	Menɔ wò ŋu nya gblɔ ge nɛ.
I was angry with myself.	Medo dziku ɖe ŋunye.
I don’t see a problem with it	Nyemekpɔ kuxi aɖeke le eŋu o
But tomorrow is another day.	Gake etsɔ nye ŋkeke bubu.
I think I can feel it	Mesusu be mate ŋu ase le ɖokuinye me
I can’t be like that	Nyemate ŋu anɔ nenema o
There was a lot to do.	Nu geɖe nɔ anyi siwo wòle be woawɔ.
I couldn’t understand them either	Nye hã nyemete ŋu se wo gɔme o
I need space.	Mehiã teƒe.
It’s just a thought.	Susu aɖe koe wònye.
Yourself, or intruders.	Wò ŋutɔ, alo ame siwo va ge ɖe eme.
I just want to make a good impression	Ðeko medi be mawɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi nyuie
That little thing	Nu sue ma .
It impressed me the most	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye wu
But do it right.	Gake wɔe nyuie.
I thought that was impossible.	Mesusu be ema manya wɔ o.
That’s a contradiction.	Ema tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
Any chance?.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe li?.
I couldn’t keep this up	Nyemete ŋu lé nya sia me ɖe asi o
And yet, this thing has to be.	Eye ke hã, ele be nu sia nanɔ nenema.
I am really like that.	Nyee nye nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
A bad day for all parties concerned	Ŋkeke gbegblẽ aɖe na akpa siwo katã ŋu nya ku ɖo
Without it, you can’t eat.	Ema manɔmee la, màte ŋu aɖu nu o.
We’re talking thousands of words a week.	Míele nu ƒom tso nya akpe geɖe ŋu le kwasiɖa me.
And one more thing.	Eye nu ɖeka hã kpe ɖe eŋu.
A great challenge and a great opportunity	Kuxi gã aɖe kple mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe
There is still much work to be done.	Dɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.
I just can’t listen to that right now	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖo to nya ma fifia o
I knew nothing bad would come of either	Menya be nu gbegblẽ aɖeke mado tso wo dometɔ aɖeke me o
That’s good enough for this time.	Ema nyo na ɣeyiɣi sia.
I asked about the project	Mebia nya ku ɖe dɔa ŋu
It's just that this guy is.	Ðeko wòle be ŋutsu sia le.
I really need some help	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo ŋutɔŋutɔ
You can sit there and work or you can just sit there.	Àte ŋu anɔ anyi ɖe afima anɔ dɔ wɔm alo àte ŋu anɔ anyi ɖe afima ko.
I think that’s a little weird	Mesusu be ema nye nusi to vovo vie
How could it be.	Aleke wòate ŋu anɔ.
I have quite a few possibilities	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ le asinye siwo ate ŋu adzɔ
Could that have happened.	Ðe wòate ŋu adzɔ nenema.
It’s hot, it’s real.	Eƒe asi xɔ dzo, enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We still can’t.	Míate ŋui kokoko o.
I can’t dwell on this for long	Nyemate ŋu anɔ nya sia ŋu ɣeyiɣi didi o
I needed to make a plan for his life	Ehiã be mawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eƒe agbe ta
It had never taken so long.	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
You can’t allow that.	Màte ŋu aɖe mɔ nenema o.
In fact, I became very attached to it	Le nyateƒe me la, meva lé ɖe eŋu vevie
Today in fact.	Egbea le nyateƒe me.
Everyone was very impressed with him.	Amewo katã ƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I saw his strong, beautiful hands	Mekpɔ eƒe asi sesẽ siwo nya kpɔ la
I want to know everything about it	Medi be manya nusianu tso eŋu
However, it is not necessary.	Ke hã, mehiã o.
It seems to be working well for me here.	Edze abe ele dɔ wɔm nyuie nam le afisia ene.
But I was expecting just as much	Gake menɔ mɔ kpɔm na nu geɖe nenema ke
I have to fight and keep going	Ele be mawɔ avu eye mayi edzi
I’m not sure here.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi le afisia o.
But one more and .	Gake ɖeka bubu kple .
And the one from.	Eye esi le tso.
I almost couldn’t do it	Nyemete ŋu wɔe o kloe
It’s a nice little word in your mouth.	Enye nya sue aɖe si me kɔ nyuie le wò nu me.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Vodada aɖeke mele ema ŋu o.
Now let me do the same.	Azɔ mina mawɔ nenema ke.
No one else can be you.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu anye wò o.
And finally.	Eye mlɔeba.
But there seems to be a serious problem.	Gake edze abe kuxi sesẽ aɖe li ene.
I had no words for it	Nya aɖeke menɔ asinye na esia o
It won’t be easy and it may take some time.	Manɔ bɔbɔe o eye ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I know what we have to do though	Menya nusi wòle be míawɔ gake

I can’t go on with this much longer	Nyemate ŋu ayi esia dzi ɣeyiɣi didi wu ema o
I was going to tell them the truth	Menɔ nyateƒea gblɔ ge na wo
I would have given up everything.	Anye ne meɖe asi le nusianu ŋu hafi.
I knew what he was doing	Menya nusi wɔm wònɔ
I never saw that side of him	Nyemekpɔ eƒe akpa ma kpɔ o
I want to marry you now not tomorrow	Medi be maɖe wò fifia ke menye etsɔ o

I would be here otherwise.	Manɔ afisia ne menye nenema o la.
I knew that would help a lot	Menya be ema akpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ
I heard your voice.	Mese wò gbe.
This is important to them.	Esia le vevie na wo.
I was kind of hoping it was you	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm le mɔ aɖe nu be wòe
Its very simple.	Eƒe bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.

I am really going to miss you.	Mele wò susu ge ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I’ve never seen you do that with anyone	Nyemekpɔ wò nèwɔ nu ma kple ame aɖeke kpɔ o
It just doesn’t make sense.	Ðeko susu mele eme o.

He has to do his job.	Ele be wòawɔ eƒe dɔ.
I can give you people to deal with	Mate ŋu ana ame siwo awɔ nu kpli wò la wò

I can’t tell him the same thing	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma ke nɛ o
It’s been a long time since I’ve heard anything	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia nyemese naneke o
Everyone is so different.	Amesiame to vovo tso wo nɔewo gbɔ ale gbegbe.
He didn’t recognize himself at all.	Mekpɔ eɖokui dze sii kura o.
Work on this.	Wɔ dɔ le esia ŋu.
He is just beginning his life.	Ðeko wòle eƒe agbe gɔme dzem.
I wish there was a normal life like that	Ne ɖe agbe si sɔ nanɔ nenema la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
I don’t want to be with anyone all day	Nyemedi be manɔ ame aɖeke gbɔ ŋkeke bliboa o
He must have been tired of being so kind to me.	Anɔ eme be ɖeɖi te eŋu le esi wòwɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋunye nyuie ta.
I don’t know when it might ever come	Nyemenya ɣeyiɣi si wòate ŋu ava kpɔ o
This is going on in his head.	Esia le edzi yim le eƒe ta me.
He was not going to interfere.	Menye ɖe wònɔ nu ɖe ​​ge ɖe eme o.
I did it just last year	Mewɔe le ƒe si va yi me ko
I want to talk to them.	Medi be maƒo nu na wo.
It was never easy.	Menɔ bɔbɔe gbeɖe o.
I know this isn’t easy for you either	Menya be esia hã mele bɔbɔe na wò o
I had to do something big, something big	Ele be mawɔ nu gã aɖe, nu gã aɖe
We’re on the road.	Míele mɔ dzi.
I don’t think he’ll remember	Nyemesusu be aɖo ŋku edzi o
Tom couldn’t see anything.	Tom mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
I would never have an issue	Anye ne nya aɖeke manɔ asinye gbeɖe o
That is not a lie.	Ema menye alakpa o.
I really want to talk to you	Medi vevie be maƒo nu kpli wò
Now he had my attention.	Fifia nye susu va nɔ esi.
A few settlers.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo siwo va nɔ afima.
I guess it’s not that bad	Mesusu be menye nu gbegblẽ nenema gbegbe o
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
I have to do it tomorrow	Ele nam be mawɔe etsɔ
There was also a simpler reason.	Susu aɖe si le bɔbɔe wu hã nɔ anyi.
I have to go to work	Ele be mayi dɔme
There was always water.	Tsi nɔ anyi ɣesiaɣi.
But there’s one he doesn’t want.	Gake ɖeka li si medi o.
I knew something I didn’t know	Menya nane si menya o
I’m happy about that.	Edzɔ dzi nam ɖe ema ŋu.
This book is in line with this.	Agbalẽ sia wɔ ɖeka kple esia.

Just a little bit will do now.	Vi aɖe koe awɔ dɔ fifia.
But it didn’t upset me	Gake medo dziku nam o
That could be a good thing.	Ema ate ŋu anye nu nyui aɖe.

The result surprised me	Nusi do tso eme la wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
I want to see that car for myself	Medi be nye ŋutɔ makpɔ ʋu ma
And these kids, too.	Eye ɖevi siawo hã.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.

They have to fight.	Ele be woawɔ avu.
You are the only one.	Wò ɖeka koe nènye.
I doubt anyone would say that now	Meke ɖi be ame aɖe agblɔ nya ma fifia
I wanted to do more than that with him tonight	Medi be mawɔ nu geɖe wu ema kplii le zã sia me
Exactly.	Tututu.
I lived here for a while.	Menɔ afisia ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
A huge chunk of time was lost	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe akpa gã aɖe bu
A name can be anything.	Ŋkɔ ate ŋu anye nusianu.
This made me angry.	Nya sia do dziku nam.
I want to get rid of you	Medi be maɖe wò ɖa
I still have a lot of opportunities to do it.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ le asinye be mawɔe.
But this is very interesting.	Gake esia doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
Who do you think is making money off of that.	Amekae nèsusu be ele ga kpɔm tso ema ŋu.
I couldn’t really understand it	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ o
He stayed there only a few months	Ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo koe wònɔ afima
There are usually several types.	Zi geɖe la, ƒomevi geɖe li.
He has a point.	Nya aɖe le esi.
He couldn’t think of any.	Mete ŋu bu ɖeke ŋu o.
I only did this once.	Zi ɖeka koe mewɔ esia.
But it really doesn’t matter at all.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mehiã kura o.

I want to know more than that	Medi be manya nu geɖe wu ema
I’m committed to it	Metsɔ ɖokuinye na
That’s a fact.	Ema nye nyateƒe.

You know it will be there, of course.	Ènya be anɔ afima ya.
I couldn’t find any words at all	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nya aɖeke kura o
I knew he could find her again, eventually	Menya be ate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu ake, mlɔeba

I wondered if there was a bullet hole in it	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe tu ƒe do aɖe le eme hã
But he had to hurry.	Gake ele be wòawɔ kaba.
And it’s in you, too.	Eye ele wò hã me.
He never tried.	Medze agbagba kpɔ o.
His hand, his hand.	Eƒe asi, eƒe asi.
I thought maybe you could suggest something.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ àte ŋu ado susu aɖe ɖa.
All of them are not very important.	Wo katã mele vevie ŋutɔ o.
Only two of them.	Wo dometɔ eve koe.

Think of what we could have had.	Bu nu siwo ate ŋu anɔ mía si hafi la ŋu kpɔ.

But something is wrong.	Gake nane gblẽ.

There are many reasons behind it.	Susu geɖe le megbe nɛ.

Maybe that’s what it is.	Ðewohĩ emae nye ema.
I can’t get rid of them all at the same time	Nyemate ŋu aɖe wo katã ɖa le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me o
I want to check this out.	Medi be makpɔ esia ɖa.
I don’t mean to bother you	Menye ɖe meɖoe be maɖe fu na wò o
Not yet anyway.	Menye haɖe o le mɔ sia mɔ nu.

But this is not the only way.	Gake menye mɔ ɖeka koe nye esia o.
Something about that was important.	Nane le ema ŋu nɔ vevie.
I know that sounds weird.	Menya be nya ma ɖi nusi mewɔ nuku o.

It’s the same thing.	Ele nenema ke.
But it never really works out.	Gake mewɔa dɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.

I have to go to the gym.	Ele be mayi.

This can’t be you.	Esia mate ŋu anye wò ŋutɔ o.

I was equally a part of this	Menye esia ƒe akpa aɖe nenema ke

Yet he felt nothing.	Ke hã mese le eɖokui me be naneke o.

I was really looking forward to this	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na esia vevie ŋutɔ
That’s really bad.	Ema gblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.

Not that I shouldn’t tell you this, officially anyway	Menye ɖe mele be magblɔ nya sia na mi o, le se nu le mɔ sia mɔ nu
I have done many times more work than before	Mewɔ dɔ siwo sɔ gbɔ wu tsã zi gbɔ zi geɖe

He has almost nothing.	Naneke kloe mele eƒe asi me o.
Everything will help you.	Nusianu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.

There were 19 cases.	Nya 19 nɔ wo dome.
I’m not one for big extravaganzas	Menye ame aɖee menye na nu gã siwo gbɔ eme o
That settled that issue.	Ema kpɔ nya ma gbɔ.
I really like you too	Wò hã dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
I tried to stay in control.	Medze agbagba be manɔ ɖokuinye dzi ɖum.
I could see nothing and hear nothing	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ naneke o eye nyemese naneke o
And of course, nothing came of it.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, naneke medo tso eme o.
I think it would be interesting.	Mesusu be anye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame.

Or turn back.	Alo trɔ ɖe megbe.
The idea is still there.	Susu la gakpɔtɔ li.
And there is no food.	Eye nuɖuɖu aɖeke meli o.
His health became more and more uncomfortable.	Eƒe lãme va nɔ fu ɖem ɖe edzi.
It is one of two things.	Enye nu eve dometɔ ɖeka.

After all, I was on a job	Le nyateƒe me la, dɔ aɖee menɔ

It will be true.	Anye nyateƒe.
It won’t work.	Mawɔ dɔ o.
But, as it is, I am alone.	Gake, abe alesi wòle ene la, nye ɖeka koe li.
Something wasn’t right.	Nane menɔ anyi nyuie o.
I can’t hope for a good outcome today	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ mɔ be nu nyui aɖe ado tso eme egbea o
But that can’t be the case.	Gake ema mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I liked that about you	Ema dzɔ dzi nam le ŋuwò
I gave him a good hand	Metsɔ asi nyui aɖe nɛ
I wasn’t really sure of anything at that point	Nyemeka ɖe naneke dzi tututu le ɣeyiɣi ma me o
I had an idea of ​​my own	Nye ŋutɔ nye susu aɖe nɔ asinye
I’ve let you go.	Meɖe asi le ŋuwò.

Doing a very good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ wɔwɔ.
Just like this project will be.	Abe alesi dɔ sia anɔ ene.
I just wanted to try something a little different	Ðeko medi be mate nane si to vovo vie la kpɔ
I knew what was coming, and death would be better	Menya nusi gbɔna, eye ku anyo wu
But it was never easy.	Gake menɔ bɔbɔe gbeɖe o.
I know my own mind and heart.	Menya nye ŋutɔ nye susu kple dzi.
I married someone.	Meɖe ame si.
I thought, maybe.	Mesusu be, ɖewohĩ.
I hope not all of them have this issue	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nya sia manɔ wo katã si o
He could have given me a point by this.	Ate ŋu ana nya aɖe nam to esia dzi hafi.
I don’t think you can.	Nyemesusu be àte ŋui o.

It’s who and what you are.	Enye amesi nènye kple nusi nènye.

More needs to be done.	Ehiã be woawɔ nu geɖe wu ema ko.
I wouldn’t have wanted to do that	Anye ne nyemedi be mawɔ nu ma o
This is very similar to the current situation.	Esia sɔ kple nɔnɔme si me míele fifia ŋutɔ.
But he wasn’t the only one.	Gake menye eya ɖeka koe o.
That didn’t last long.	Ema menɔ anyi didi o.

He needed something.	Ehiã nane.

I actually enjoyed it a lot	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
There was only one problem.	Kuxi ɖeka koe do mo ɖa.
Now, not so much.	Fifia, menye nenema gbegbe o.
I am like that.	Mele nenema.
I have heard some very good things about it.	Mese nya nyui aɖewo ŋutɔ tso eŋu.

But he was glad they were.	Gake edzɔ dzi nɛ ya be wole nenema.

I would only be there for a few hours.	Gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo koe manɔ afima.
I can’t do it alone	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔe o
I knew there was anger in my voice.	Menya be dziku le nye gbe me.

You may need to make an appointment.	Ðewohĩ ahiã be nàwɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ɣeyiɣi aɖe ŋu hafi awɔe.

You can understand them.	Àte ŋu ase wo gɔme.
I need to know everything that is going on	Ele be manya nusianu si le edzi yim
It’s a more difficult situation.	Enye nɔnɔme si sesẽ wu.
None of them can work.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ dɔ o.
No one else was with us.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ mía gbɔ o.
But in reality, the opposite is true.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae.
I have to keep talking	Ele be mayi edzi anɔ nu ƒom

This is a difficult task.	Esia nye dɔ sesẽ aɖe.
I think something good did come out of that day	Mesusu be nu nyui aɖe do tso ŋkeke ma me nyateƒe
That’s a crazy idea.	Ema nye susu si me susu mele o.

Are you ready for this?.	Ðe nèle klalo na esia?.
I can only say so much.	Nya geɖe koe mate ŋu agblɔ.
I can’t quite explain it either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu aɖe eme tututu o
They must be done simultaneously.	Ele be woawɔ wo le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
There are a couple of dogs.	Avu eve aɖewo li.
Nothing can take that away.	Naneke mate ŋu aɖe ema ɖa o.

I hope it goes well today	Mele mɔ kpɔm be azɔ nyuie egbea
I hope things have changed for you.	Mekpɔ mɔ be nuwo trɔ na wò.
I hope no one struggles with that fact.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ame aɖeke mawɔ avu kple nyateƒe ma o.

For your sake.	Le wò ta.
Not for you.	Menye na wò o.

That was good enough for me.	Ema nyo nam ale gbegbe.

And let me explain that.	Eye mina maɖe nya ma me.
He wasn’t angry with her.	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu o.

But he had to try everything.	Gake ele nɛ be wòate nusianu kpɔ.
Yet something was missing.	Ke hã nane nɔ anyi si bu.
But there is no hardship.	Gake nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖeke meli o.

For one thing, he had no idea beyond that.	Nu ɖekae nye be susu aɖeke menɔ esi wu ema o.
No one is like that.	Ame aɖeke mele nenema o.
I just couldn’t help myself	Ðeko nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe ɖokuinye nu o

There is nothing of any use here.	Naneke meli si aɖe vi aɖeke na mí le afisia o.
I just can’t be happy	Ðeko nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ o
And he wasn’t the only one who changed.	Eye menye eya ɖeka koe trɔ o.
And you can only have one of each.	Eye wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe dometɔ ɖeka koe ate ŋu anɔ asiwò.
This kind of life seems outdated.	Edze abe agbe sia ƒomevi do xoxo ene.
I don’t want to be like this	Nyemedi be manɔ alea o
And it’s actually quite simple.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
He was a very great man.	Enye ame gã aɖe ŋutɔ.

You have to keep your eye on it.	Ele be wò ŋku nanɔ eŋu.
It is an honor to know you	Enye bubu nam be menya wò
But it’s not there.	Gake mele afima o.
Go back to the house.	Trɔ yi aƒea me.
It was a very difficult job.	Enye dɔ sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
There was something about it that opened the door for me	Nane nɔ eme si ʋu mɔ nam
You have so much to tell and so little time.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li nàgblɔ na wò eye ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe li.
I couldn’t let myself get that close	Nyemete ŋu ɖe mɔ be mate ɖe eŋu nenema gbegbe o
I actually used to work for him	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔa dɔ nɛ tsã
Money is a fact.	Ga nye nyateƒe.
There was another one.	Bubu hã nɔ anyi.
Do this for a month.	Wɔ esia ɣleti ɖeka.
But the reality is the opposite.	Gake nyateƒea ya to vovo na ema.
That just doesn’t matter.	Ðeko ema mehiã o.
None of them do this.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔa esia o.
We could have been anything.	Míate ŋu anye nusianu hafi.

A final task arrived.	Dɔ mamlɛtɔ aɖe va ɖo.
I just knew he was somewhere in that city	Ðeko menya be ele du ma ƒe teƒe aɖe
I knew you were going to die.	Menya be èle kuku ge.
I didn’t want to talk to him	Nyemedi be maƒo nu kplii o

That can be helpful.	Ema ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu.
There are only two things to do here.	Nu eve aɖewo koe li woawɔ le afisia.
All these things are in our heads.	Nu siawo katã le míaƒe ta me.
This guy is a real job.	Ŋutsu sia nye dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t want your first time to be like that	Nyemedi be wò zi gbãtɔ nanɔ nenema o
But the reality is quite different.	Gake nyateƒea ya to vovo kura.
It’s just that way.	Ðeko wòle nenema.
This can happen in two ways.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ le mɔ eve nu.
I have done this more than once.	Mewɔ esia wu zi ɖeka.
This is so difficult.	Esia sesẽ ale gbegbe.
That had never been an issue for him.	Ema menye nya aɖeke nɛ kpɔ o.

But it was only a matter of time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
You should never work.	Mele be nàwɔ dɔ gbeɖe o.

It’s a very good idea.	Enye susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
If so, he can contact us.	Ne ele nenema la, ate ŋu aƒo ka na mí.

I still couldn’t relax	Nyemete ŋu ɖe dzi ɖi haɖe o
But we are trying.	Gake míele agbagba dzem.
Which is actually kind of fake.	Nusi nye alakpa ƒomevi aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This sounds odd	Esia ɖi nusi to vovo kura
I'll explain it to you.	Maɖe eme na wò.
I can do it, not anyone else	Mate ŋu awɔe, menye ame bubu aɖeke o
The house would be done before much longer.	Woawɔ aƒea hafi ɣeyiɣi didi wu ema.
If you think it will help, you can try.	Ne èsusu be akpe ɖe ŋuwò la, àte ŋu ate kpɔ.
Everything is fine.	Nusianu le nyuie.
And the coconut.	Eye kokoko.
You can always do it.	Àte ŋui ɣesiaɣi.
This is different, as if it had been many.	Esia to vovo, abe ɖe wònye ame geɖe tsã ene.
Maybe go with that?.	Ðewohĩ yi kple ema?.
A lot has happened since that season ended	Nu geɖe dzɔ tso esime ɣeyiɣi ma wu enu
I hope he hasn't come to this already.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be meva ɖo esia gbɔ xoxo o.
I didn’t feel like talking to anyone	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be maƒo nu kple ame aɖeke o
It certainly would have happened.	Anye ne edzɔ godoo.
I couldn’t let go of myself	Nyemete ŋu ɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu o
I'll explain as many times as you want.	Maɖe eme zi alesi nèdi.

It is everything we are not.	Enye nusianu si míenye o.
It’s just a thought	Susu aɖe koe wònye
Not where we live.	Menye afisi míele o.
I think maybe too soon	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ kaba akpa
I was starting a new school again.	Menɔ suku yeye aɖe gɔme dzem ake.
I want them to have a life.	Medi be agbe nanɔ wo si.
Still, it is possible.	Ke hã, anya wɔ.
I tried to be kind.	Medze agbagba be mawɔ nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu nyuie.
I can’t handle this	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ o
I can’t see anything about this	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ naneke le esia ŋu o
I just knew something would happen	Ðeko menya be nane adzɔ
I hope everyone is happy	Mele mɔ kpɔm be dzi adzɔ amesiame
I want to share that joy with you	Medi be magblɔ dzidzɔ ma na mi
I thought he was hot	Mesusu be eƒe lãme xɔ dzo
And it was more or less easy.	Eye wònɔ bɔbɔe wu alo wu nenema.
That seems to have appealed to many.	Edze abe nya ma dze ame geɖe ŋu ene.
I never heard anyone talk about doing that.	Nyemese ame aɖeke ƒo nu tso nu ma wɔwɔ ŋu kpɔ o.
If anyone is interested.	Ne ame aɖe tsɔ ɖe le eme.
But it is necessary.	Gake ehiã.
He has to act.	Ele be wòawɔ nu.
Mentally, he wasn’t ready for this.	Le susu me la, menɔ klalo na esia o.
I am just asking the question.	Ðeko mele nya la biam.
Come, but may not stay.	Va, gake ɖewohĩ manɔ anyi o.
He never refused one.	Megbe ɖeka gbeɖe o.
I think we have everything	Mesusu be nusianu le mía si
Neither of us said anything.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
But, the real issue is in the heart.	Gake, nya la ŋutɔŋutɔ le dzi me.
For many years.	Ƒe geɖe.
I tried that last time	Mete ema kpɔ zi mamlɛtɔ
I have something else to do	Nu bubu aɖe hã le asinye mawɔ
I don’t understand me either, for that matter	Nye hã nyemese nu gɔme nam o, le nya ma ta
This will continue.	Esia ayi edzi.
I guess he doesn’t seem convinced he’s there.	Mesusu be edze abe meka ɖe edzi be ele afima o ene.
I was the first time he did it	Nyee nye zi gbãtɔ si wòwɔ
I revealed too much.	Meɖe nu geɖe fia akpa.
I think this is a little too simple	Mesusu be esia le bɔbɔe akpa vie
It never occurred to me.	Meva susu me nam kpɔ o.
Yet no one came.	Ke hã ame aɖeke meva o.
I'm not sure who he was talking to	Nyemeka ɖe amesi wònɔ nu ƒom na dzi o
Nothing is bothering me.	Naneke mele fu ɖem nam o.
That had appealed to him.	Ema dzɔ dzi nɛ kpɔ.
I was sure his name would come to me.	Meka ɖe edzi be eƒe ŋkɔ ava nam.
Tre was happy.	Dzi dzɔ Tre.
This is among us.	Esia le mía dome.

I think this is a great idea	Mesusu be esia nye susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ
I am taking legal care of you.	Mele wò dzi kpɔm le se nu.

I became interested in it.	Meva tsɔ ɖe le eme.
Everyone knows us.	Amesiame nya mí.
I don’t want to continue	Nyemedi be mayi edzi o
We can have a good life here together.	Míate ŋu anɔ agbe nyui le afisia ɖekae.
But none of them did that.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
I just can’t allow that	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ nenema o
Think about your tongue.	Bu wò aɖe ŋu.
I like this idea.	Susu sia dzɔa dzi nam.
You are not here to fight anyone.	Menye ɖe nèle afisia be yeawɔ avu kple ame aɖeke o.
He’s more organized these days.	Ewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu wu le ŋkeke siawo me.
I don’t know anything about this	Nyemenya naneke tso esia ŋu o
I wondered if they were going to die	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe wole kuku ge hã
This is a hugely difficult problem.	Esia nye kuxi sesẽ gã aɖe.
Many others cannot.	Ame bubu geɖe mate ŋui o.
There is no name for anywhere.	Ŋkɔ aɖeke meli na afi aɖeke o.
I am the one who keeps your name	Nyee nye ame si lé wò ŋkɔ ɖe te
I threw myself at him.	Metsɔ ɖokuinye ƒu gbe ɖe edzi.
I was very interested in what thought	Metsɔ ɖe le nusi susu me ŋutɔ
Keep me up too.	Na nye hã nanɔ dzi ƒom.
I have seen some of them	Mekpɔ wo dometɔ aɖewo
It could be the same one.	Ate ŋu anye ɖeka ma ke.
He didn’t have it.	Menɔ eŋu o.
I had to let it go	Ele be maɖe asi le eŋu
I can’t get out of it now	Nyemate ŋu ado le eme fifia o
I think that’s definitely important for something as well.	Mesusu be ema le vevie na nane hã godoo.
That’s a lot for you to do.	Ema nye nu geɖe na wò be nàwɔ.
I used to know this person	Menya ame sia tsã
I'll try that thing.	Mate nu ma kpɔ.
I have to apologize too	Ele be nye hã maɖe kuku
I don’t have a home without her	Aƒe aɖeke mele asinye eya manɔmee o
I hope all is well	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nuwo katã anyo
I wasn’t talking to him.	Menye ɖe menɔ nu ƒom nɛ o.
I still had a lot to do	Nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ asinye mawɔ
I just felt it and knew it was there, inside	Ðeko mese le ɖokuinye me eye menya be ele afima, le eme
I knew he would remember what happened	Menya be aɖo ŋku nusi dzɔ dzi
This surprised them.	Esia wɔ nuku na wo.
It doesn’t matter much.	Mehiã boo o.
I remember that year very well	Meɖo ŋku ƒe ma dzi nyuie ŋutɔ
And he still had the gun, of course.	Eye tu la gakpɔtɔ nɔ esi ya.
I need to explain more of it all	Ele be maɖe eme geɖe wu le wo katã me
I know this is very true for me.	Menya be esia nye nyateƒe ŋutɔ nam.
I shouldn’t have been so surprised	Mele be wòawɔ nuku nam nenema gbegbe hafi o
I began to turn to him	Medze egɔme trɔ ɖe eŋu
But few things are working well.	Gake nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe le dɔ wɔm nyuie.
I remember hearing that name	Meɖo ŋku edzi be mese ŋkɔ ma
I have never been able to help her	Nyemete ŋu kpe ɖe eŋu kpɔ o
I knew what he was planning	Menya nusi ŋu wònɔ ɖoɖo wɔm ɖo
A bad attitude.	Nɔnɔme gbegblẽ aɖe.
He couldn't think of one time.	Mete ŋu bu ɣeyiɣi ɖeka ŋu o.
It’s a very good thing.	Enye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
It didn’t really bother me	Meɖe fu nam ŋutɔŋutɔ o
Yours is real.	Wò tɔ nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We had a new house.	Aƒe yeye aɖe nɔ mía si.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
No one is going to accept them	Ame aɖeke mele wo dzi xɔ ge o
Your voice matters.	Wò gbe le vevie.
And your heart is ready, really ready.	Eye wò dzi le klalo, le klalo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But something told me.	Gake nane gblɔ nam.
I think in the end it was all too much	Mesusu be mlɔeba la, wo katã va sɔ gbɔ akpa
It seems that	Edze abe .
I have to go some time	Ele be mayi ɣeyiɣi aɖe
It needs too much.	Ehiã nu geɖe akpa.
I am not going to tell you the truth	Nyemele nyateƒea ɖe ge na mi o
He could hardly stand up at all	Mete ŋu tsi tre kura kura o
But it isn’t like that.	Gake mele nenema o.
I am just as concerned about it as you are	Nye hã metsi dzi ɖe eŋu abe wò ke ene
I wanted to handle things on my own	Medi be makpɔ nuwo gbɔ le ɖokuinye si
He threw them away.	Etsɔ wo ƒu gbe.
And yet there was no one like him.	Eye ke hã ame aɖeke menɔ anyi abe eya ene o.
I wanted some time to myself.	Medi be ɣeyiɣi aɖe nanɔ ɖokuinye si.
I remember every little detail about it	Meɖo ŋku nu sue ɖesiaɖe si ku ɖe eŋu la dzi
And it’s probably true.	Eye anɔ eme be enye nyateƒe.
But you have a book.	Gake agbalẽ aɖe le asiwò.
Come from it.	Va tso eme.
I couldn’t have been more productive than he was	Nyemate ŋu anye amesi mewɔa dɔ nyuie wu eya o
I quickly recognized this man	Mekpɔ ŋutsu sia dze sii kaba
I finally felt it.	Mese le ɖokuinye me mlɔeba.
I can’t tell you the reasons why I care.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ susu siwo ta metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò o.
It’s just that way.	Ðeko wòle nenema.
Maybe they are very important.	Ðewohĩ wole vevie ŋutɔ.
I want to see things for myself	Medi be nye ŋutɔ makpɔ nuwo
I can’t do anything at all	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke kura o
This is a pretty big deal.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.

I’ve done it before	Mewɔe kpɔ
I always have more than one job on the go	Dɔ siwo wu ɖeka nɔa asinye ɣesiaɣi le mɔ dzi
However, there are two problems here.	Ke hã, kuxi eve le afisia.
You have a great voice.	Gbe gã aɖe le asiwò.
I had to talk to him about it	Ele be maƒo nu tso eŋu nɛ
That is so difficult.	Ema sesẽ ale gbegbe.
I gave them all a lot of thought	Metsɔ susu ɖo wo katã ŋu geɖe
This week has been weird.	Kwasiɖa sia nye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I sure hope he does.	Meka ɖe edzi be mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔe nenema.

I just didn’t know who to talk to	Ðeko nyemenya amesi maƒo nu na o
I haven’t had a problem with them yet	Nyemekpɔ kuxi aɖeke le wo ŋu haɖe o
What makes sense.	Nusi me susu le.
He is not a stable person.	Menye ame si li ke o.
Keep your eye on it.	Wò ŋku nanɔ eŋu.
I would be more than happy to know more.	Adzɔ dzi nam wu be manya nya geɖe wu.
They have guns.	Tu le wo si.
He didn’t seem to exist	Mewɔ abe ɖe meli o ene
I can never do it.	Nyemate ŋui gbeɖe o.
You can’t just eat one.	Màte ŋu aɖu ɖeka ko o.
I have to go to work in two hours	Ele be mayi dɔme le gaƒoƒo eve megbe
I prayed that way.	Medo gbe ɖa nenema.
I knew it was impossible	Menya be manya wɔ o
I know this is a really long post but sorry.	Menya be esia nye nya didi aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ gake taflatse.

For the right people.	Na ame siwo sɔ.
The work is in progress	Dɔa le edzi yim
It wasn’t going very well.	Menɔ edzi yim nyuie tututu o.
One more problem.	Kuxi ɖeka bubu.
I was kind of impressed that I liked it	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye le mɔ aɖe nu be edzɔ dzi nam
I moderately liked the wet part	Akpa si me tsi le la dze ŋunye le mɔ si sɔ nu
There is no water here.	Tsi aɖeke mele afisia o.
People expect you to be able to predict.	Amewo kpɔa mɔ be àte ŋu agblɔ nya ɖi.
I was nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe.
I am ready for this job	Mele klalo na dɔ sia
I couldn’t have done it without you.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe wò manɔmee o.
I don’t want to be like him	Nyemedi be manɔ abe eya ene o
It can tell you a lot.	Ate ŋu agblɔ nu geɖe na wò.
I was always doing my own thing	Menɔ nye ŋutɔ nye nuwo wɔm ɣesiaɣi
The present paper continues this work.	Agbalẽ si li fifia yi dɔ sia dzi.
I probably would have been better off at this point	Anɔ eme be anyo nam wu le ɣeyiɣi sia me hafi
I could clearly hear that in her voice.	Mete ŋu se nya ma nyuie le eƒe gbe me.
I think everybody knows	Mesusu be amesiame nya
We had quite a strict rule	Se sesẽ aɖe kura nɔ mía si
I know this sounds complicated	Menya be esia ɖi nya sesẽ aɖe
He offered his hand.	Etsɔ eƒe asi na.
I couldn’t knock them out	Nyemete ŋu ƒo wo ɖa o
I wanted to relax	Medi be maɖe dzi ɖi
These two have no problems.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ame eve siawo ŋu o.
I don’t really want to know more about it	Nyemedi ŋutɔŋutɔ be manya nu geɖe tso eŋu o
I can give you anything your heart could desire	Mate ŋu ana nusianu si wò dzi ate ŋu adi la wò
I had fun, man.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ, ŋutsu.
It was a shock to me	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
Hold on to it somehow.	Lé edzi le mɔ aɖe nu.
In fact, he needs them.	Le nyateƒe me la, ehiã wo.
It would probably annoy me more.	Anɔ eme be ado dziku nam wu.
But that has now changed.	Gake ema trɔ fifia.
I know all the bad things that happened	Menya nu gbegblẽ siwo katã dzɔ
It’s not enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
I can put them together	Mate ŋu aƒo wo nu ƒu ɖekae
But now I can't seem to make it work.	Gake fifia edze abe nyemate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ o ene.
There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eme o.
Keep your head down.	Na wò ta nanɔ anyi.
Everything was going well.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie.
I shouldn’t have said anything	Mele be magblɔ nya aɖeke hafi o
A lot of people are making a lot of money.	Ame geɖe le ga geɖe kpɔm.
You’ll be very excited.	Adzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ.
I also made my name	Mewɔ nye ŋkɔ hã
It’s not like it’s a surprise after the fact.	Menye abe ɖe wònye nusi wɔ nuku le nyateƒea megbe ene o.
Use common sense for this.	Zã susu nyui na esia.
I can’t be mad at him	Nyemate ŋu ado dziku ɖe eŋu o
Part of him hoped it was	Eƒe akpa aɖe nɔ mɔ kpɔm be ele nenema
I have never seen anything so extreme in my life	Nyemekpɔ naneke si gbɔ eme alea le nye agbe me kpɔ o
I need to talk to him as soon as possible.	Ele be maƒo nu kplii kaba ale si mate ŋui.
I held the gun to his head	Metsɔ tu la ƒo ɖe eƒe ta gbɔ
I shouldn’t be in this city	Mele be manɔ du sia me o
This is still true for me.	Esia gakpɔtɔ nye nyateƒe nam.
I think that’s totally appropriate	Mesusu be esia sɔ kura
I didn’t hear anything	Nyemese naneke o
And the other way around, too.	Eye le mɔ bubu nu la, hã.
It won’t be like that.	Manɔ nenema o.
I don’t want to.	Nyemedi o.
Everything else is fun but not that important.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe doa dzidzɔ nɛ gake mele vevie nɛ nenema gbegbe o.
Inside inside, out of it.	Le me le eme, do le eme.
Nothing new here.	Nu yeye aɖeke mele afisia o.

I don’t want anything to do with it.	Nyemedi be naneke nawɔ ɖeka kplii o.

Make a horse.	Wɔ sɔ aɖe.
I am really liking our dog.	Mele míaƒe avu la ƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.

Now it’s your turn.	Azɔ wò ɣeyiɣi.
It will be like that.	Anɔ nenema.
I grew up here as a person.	Metsi le afisia abe ame ene.
I wasn't sure how to react seriously	Nyemeka ɖe alesi mawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu vevie dzi o
I want to do it for all of you	Medi be mawɔe na mi katã
I never seemed to have that problem before I moved.	Edze abe kuxi ma menɔ ŋunye hafi ʋu yi teƒe bubu kpɔ o ene.
Attitude is everything.	Nɔnɔme nye nusianu.

We are looking forward to that.	Míele mɔ kpɔm na ema vevie.

I couldn’t believe what had just happened	Nyemete ŋu xɔ nusi dzɔ teti koe nye ema la dzi se o
He is there, too.	Eya hã le afima.

He will do it with pleasure.	Awɔe kple dzidzɔ.
I couldn’t process what had just happened	Nyemete ŋu trɔ asi le nusi dzɔ teti koe nye ema ŋu o
And you will need to tell the truth.	Eye ahiã be nàgblɔ nyateƒea.
I can communicate with them, sort of.	Mate ŋu aɖo dze kple wo, ƒomevi aɖe.

It felt like home to me.	Ewɔ nam abe aƒe ene.

I can’t stay here.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afisia o.

That is a simple matter.	Nya bɔbɔe aɖee nye ema.
Few people did that.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔe nenema.
And there were a lot of problems.	Eye kuxi geɖe nɔ anyi.
I think that could work	Mesusu be ema ate ŋu awɔ dɔ
He didn’t ask about you.	Mebia nya tso ŋuwò o.
I tried to make that point here	Medze agbagba be magblɔ nya ma le afisia
It's doing just fine.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie ko.
Way is better than difficulty.	Mɔ nyo wu nu sesẽ.
Four months in all.	Ɣleti ene le wo katã me.

Everything else will be a little easier after that.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe anɔ bɔbɔe vie le ema megbe.

I'm sure this could be the case	Meka ɖe edzi be esia ate ŋu anɔ nenema
My own life was like that.	Nye ŋutɔ nye agbe nɔ nenema.

But anything is possible!.	Gake nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ!.

We just don’t know exactly why.	Ðeko míenya nusita tututu o.

I can never be in my mind.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ susu me nam gbeɖe o.

My hand was so easy on this.	Nye asi nɔa esia dzi bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
That was a real treat.	Ema nye nuɖuɖu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe.
There was no name on it.	Ŋkɔ aɖeke menɔ edzi o.
It will be like that.	Anɔ nenema.
Like the one before.	Abe esi nɔ anyi do ŋgɔ ene.
I think that’s why it’s like this.	Mesusu be esia tae wòle alea ɖo.
You are in our house.	Èle míaƒe aƒeme.
That was a huge mistake.	Ema nye vodada gã aɖe.
Stay in a good mood.	Nɔ nɔnɔme nyui me.
This man had a gun.	Tu nɔ ame sia si.
In fact, not at all.	Le nyateƒe me la, menye nenema kura o.

I thought it was amazing, actually	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me
I’ve never felt that way before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o
You were the only one.	Wò ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
But he is a real person.	Gake enye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I was able to hold down a job some	Mete ŋu lé dɔ aɖe ɖe asi aɖewo
One man does things	Ŋutsu ɖeka koe wɔa nuwo
But they have one mind and one motive.	Gake susu ɖeka kple susu ɖeka le wo si.
Something changed inside.	Nane trɔ ɖe eme.
If necessary, add a little more water or water.	Ne ehiã la, tsɔ tsi alo tsi vi aɖe kpe ɖe eŋu.
But that’s not a book.	Gake menye agbalẽ aɖee nye ema o.
I didn’t know what to say at that moment	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma me o
I don’t know how well this works.	Nyemenya alesi esia wɔa dɔ nyuie o.
But it’s only for one day.	Gake ŋkeke ɖeka koe.
I was so angry with him	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe
Not that big of a deal at all.	Menye nu gã ma kura o.
Something had happened.	Nane dzɔ kpɔ.

We have to have something.	Ele be nane nanɔ mía si.
I told you before, nothing is more important than you	Megblɔ na mi do ŋgɔ be, naneke megale vevie wu wò o
Everything is about money today.	Nusianu ku ɖe ga ŋu egbea.
This was a very difficult problem for me.	Esia nye kuxi sesẽ aɖe nam ŋutɔ.
I really like that idea	Susu ma dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
It doesn’t work that way.	Mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
He may be very unresponsive.	Ate ŋu anye ame si mewɔa nu ɖe ​​ame ŋu kura o.

Either that or we’re doing something really wrong.	Ema alo míele nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ wɔm.

And inside it, too.	Eye le eme hã.
About two days.	Anɔ abe ŋkeke eve ene.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
But just a little bit.	Gake vi aɖe ko.
In the end, he couldn’t see anyone or anything.	Mlɔeba la, mete ŋu kpɔ ame aɖeke alo naneke o.
They were easy to follow.	Wo dzi wɔwɔ nɔ bɔbɔe.
I don’t know where that came from.	Nyemenya afi si nya ma tso o.
However, this is not a problem.	Ke hã, esia menye kuxi o.
You could have donated blood.	Àte ŋu ado ʋu hafi.
I was very pleased with it	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
That would be totally wrong.	Ema anye nu gbegblẽ kura.
Someone else made that happen.	Ame bubu aɖee na ema va eme.
I had the whole day to plan	Gbe bliboa nɔ asinye mawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu
I needed to protect myself	Ehiã be makpɔ ɖokuinye ta
It’s really amazing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This was very difficult for me	Esia sesẽ nam ŋutɔ
Nothing can be ours.	Naneke mate ŋu anye mía tɔ o.

I felt satisfied	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme

It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I have to get out of there, right now	Ele nam be mado le afima, fifia tututu
I stood up to greet him	Metsi tre be mado gbe nɛ
But part of me wants to impress.	Gake nye akpa aɖe di be yeawɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi.
Step into it.	Ðe afɔ ɖe eme.
That will come in the coming days.	Ema ava le ŋkeke siwo gbɔna me.
Which is probably just as well.	Nusi ɖewohĩ nyo nenema ke.
He just sat there.	Ðeko wònɔ anyi ɖe afima.

I was running through the room.	Menɔ du dzi to xɔa me.
I want to continue to address that.	Medi be mayi edzi akpɔ nya ma gbɔ.
I stayed with them all morning	Menɔ wo gbɔ ŋdi bliboa katã
His face hardened against them.	Eƒe mo sesẽ ɖe wo ŋu.
Just as importantly.	Abe alesi wòle vevie ene.
This is enough.	Esia sɔ gbɔ.
I can’t understand it either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu ase egɔme o
Please get up.	Taflatse tso.
I would have done the same	Anye ne nye hã mawɔ nenema ke
This is very, very, very wrong.	Esia nye nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
I could be doing that myself at home.	Nye ŋutɔ mate ŋu anɔ ema wɔm le aƒeme.
But he is not a real child.	Gake menye ɖevi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I can tell you one thing.	Mate ŋu agblɔ nya ɖeka na wò.
They’re working really hard on that.	Wole dɔ wɔm tso ema ŋu vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I need to talk to him.	Ele be maƒo nu kplii.
Please go there.	Taflatse yi afima.
I said earlier that things are complicated	Megblɔ do ŋgɔ be nuwo sesẽ
However, this is not necessary.	Ke hã, esia mehiã o.
A reality he can step into	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe si me wòate ŋu aɖo afɔ nu ɖo
He won’t do it.	Mawɔe o.

He didn’t see how a single man could do it.	Mekpɔ alesi ŋutsu tre ate ŋu awɔe o.
Car is running very well.	Ʋu le du dzi nyuie ŋutɔ.
I didn’t mean to upset him	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mado dziku nɛ o
He was such a great dog.	Avu gã aɖee wònye nenema gbegbe.

I have never been able to see them	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ wo kpɔ o
So much so that it is very much a part of each other.	Ale gbegbe be enye wo nɔewo ƒe akpa aɖe ŋutɔ.
That must have passed him by.	Ema anya to eŋu.

The same thing happened to me today	Nu ma ke dzɔ ɖe dzinye egbea

I was with him.	Menɔ eŋu.

It’s been good to me in that way.	Ewɔ nyui nam le mɔ ma nu.
No one found me from behind.	Ame aɖeke meva ke ɖe ŋunye tso megbe o.
I will do it again and again.	Mawɔe zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I can’t remember his face.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe mo dzi o.
He seems to have very good support.	Edze abe kpekpeɖeŋu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ le eŋu ene.
And none of them were happy about it.	Eye wo dometɔ aɖeke mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu o.
But it doesn’t seem to work.	Gake edze abe mewɔa dɔ o ene.
Now, pay attention to it.	Azɔ, lé to ɖe eŋu.
I know this and it doesn’t bother me	Menya esia eye meɖe fu nam o

Not his leg.	Menye eƒe afɔ o.
It was a good night.	Zã nyui aɖee wònye.

I began to wonder if he was okay	Meva nɔ ɖokuinye biam be ɖe wòle nyuie hã
There is no one in it.	Ame aɖeke mele eme o.

I can’t see his face	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ eƒe mo o
I also made it my home	Mewɔe nye aƒe hã
That definitely makes things easier.	Ema na nuwo le bɔbɔe godoo.
And it isn’t at all.	Eye menye nenema kura o.
There has to be a reason.	Ele be susu aɖe nanɔ anyi.
I need time.	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi.
I came for a couple of reasons	Meva susu eve aɖewo ta
He couldn’t stand it.	Mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
Maybe I should do that	Ðewohĩ ele be mawɔe nenema
I can’t be there anymore	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afima azɔ o
I had one foot here and one foot there	Afɔ ɖeka nɔ asinye le afisia eye afɔ ɖeka nɔ asinye le afima
He was a very nice guy.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Think of someone who annoys you.	Bu ame aɖe si doa dziku na wò la ŋu kpɔ.
Nothing serious, but it does seem to have one problem.	Naneke meli vevie o, gake edze abe kuxi ɖeka le eŋu ene.
Everything went his way this year.	Nusianu yi eƒe mɔ nu le ƒe sia me.

At just the right time.	Le ɣeyiɣi si sɔ tututu me.

Tonight was a night like so many others.	Zã sia nye zã aɖe abe zã bubu geɖe ene.

But it won’t help if you say anything.	Gake maɖe vi ne ègblɔ nya aɖeke o.

There is a time when you want nothing.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe li si me mèdi naneke o.

It looks like it might not come cheap.	Edze abe ɖewohĩ mava le asi bɔbɔe me o ene.

Everything about it was different	Nusianu si ku ɖe eŋu la to vovo

You’re going down that road.	Èle mɔ ma dzi yim.

In the decay of the room.	Le xɔa me ƒe gbegblẽ me.
And yet, at the same time, it cannot be.	Eye ke hã, le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me la, mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I lost all my money.	Nye ga katã bu nam.
Life and death.	Agbe kple ku.
I think it’s a good point.	Mesusu be enye nya nyui aɖe.
I was relaxed about it.	Meɖe dzi ɖi le eŋu.
Yet it seems a little unnecessary to me.	Ke hã edze nam be mehiã vie o.
I want to be here for them.	Medi be manɔ afisia na wo.

Some of them were still in a difficult situation.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ nɔ nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe me.

I’m glad he’s happy	Edzɔ dzi nam be ele dzidzɔ kpɔm

That much is obvious.	Nu ma gbegbe dze ƒã.

I don’t want to tell you this	Nyemedi be magblɔ nya sia na wò o
However, it’s not a necessary condition.	Ke hã, menye nɔnɔme si hiã o.
But nothing really worked.	Gake naneke mewɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.

There is a point to this though.	Nya aɖe le esia ŋu gake.

He was a good guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖee wònye.

This is not something everyone is comfortable with.	Esia menye nusi me amesiame ƒe dzi dze eme le o.

Consider that opportunity.	Bu mɔnukpɔkpɔ ma ŋu kpɔ.

Survivors know how short life can be.	Ame siwo tsi agbe la nya alesi gbegbe agbe ate ŋu anɔ kpuie.

You are happy when you are in it.	Dzi dzɔa wò ne èle eme.
Maybe he missed that more.	Ðewohĩ ema to eŋu wu.
Everyone else has.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe si.
He liked the simplicity.	Alesi wòle bɔbɔe la dze eŋu ŋutɔ.

Not really, anyway.	Menye le nyateƒe me o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.

Everything was too much for him.	Nusianu sɔ gbɔ nɛ akpa.

However, the same rule applies.	Ke hã, se ma ke ku ɖe eŋu.
For many reasons.	Le susu geɖe ta.

It’s actually quite a challenge.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye kuxi gã aɖe ŋutɔ.

Always keep this in mind.	Esia nanɔ susu me na wò ɣesiaɣi.
I remember one of my first days there	Meɖo ŋku ŋkeke gbãtɔ siwo metsɔ nɔ afima la dometɔ ɖeka dzi
It seems so easy for everyone else and impossible for me.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ na ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene eye manya wɔ nam o.
I shouldn’t be doing that to him	Mele be manɔ nu ma wɔm ɖe eŋu o
But there is a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖe li.
It’s all or nothing here.	Enye nusianu alo naneke mele afisia o.
Everything went to plan .	Nusianu yi ɖe ɖoɖo nu .
I want to explain why this annoys me so much.	Medi be maɖe nusita esia doa dziku nam alea gbegbe la me.

I couldn’t quite stand it myself	Nye ŋutɔ nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu tututu o
You can talk whatever you want.	Àte ŋu aƒo nu nu sia nu si nèdi.
Just a little bit.	Vi aɖe ko.
Nothing works or lives anywhere near it.	Naneke mewɔa dɔ alo nɔa agbe le afi aɖeke si te ɖe eŋu o.
But this is just my one shot.	Gake nye tu ɖeka koe nye esia.
I thought he could do nothing but help us	Mesusu be mate ŋu awɔ naneke wu kpekpeɖeŋu na mí ko o
It wasn’t anything at all.	Menye naneke kura o.
A look of dignity appeared on his face	Bubu ƒe mo aɖe dze mo nɛ
I don’t know what it is.	Nyemenya nusi wònye o.
Literally everything that comes with it.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusianu si kpe ɖe eŋu.
I know they will do well together	Menya be woawɔ nu nyuie ɖekae
There is simply no reason for it.	Ðeko susu aɖeke meli si tae wòle nenema ɖo o.

But that’s what they’re talking about.	Gake ema tae wole nu ƒom ɖo.
Leave them alone.	Gblẽ wo ɖi.
Everything seems so extreme.	Edze abe nusianu si gbɔ eme ale gbegbe ene.
He can keep up with that.	Ate ŋu awɔ ɖe ema dzi.
And the fire, too.	Eye dzo la hã.
But there is one problem with it.	Gake kuxi ɖeka aɖe le eŋu.
Not too big and not too small.	Menye gã akpa o eye menye sue hã o.

I actually like this idea	Le nyateƒe me la, susu sia dzɔa dzi nam
I was expecting someone else myself	Nye ŋutɔ menɔ mɔ kpɔm na ame bubu aɖe
It’s just another machine.	Mɔ̃ bubu aɖe koe wònye.
That is clear on the whole.	Nya ma me kɔ le bliboa me.

I think it worked.	Mesusu be ewɔ dɔ.
We’re on the road.	Míele mɔ dzi.
It's the opposite, if anything.	Enye nusi to vovo na ema, ne nane li.

I guess that probably sounds weird	Mesusu be nya ma anya ɖi nusi mewɔ nuku o
You seem very knowledgeable.	Edze abe ènya nu geɖe ŋutɔ ene.
And things remained still for days.	Eye nuwo gakpɔtɔ nɔ anyi ŋkeke geɖe.

There had never been anyone.	Ame aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.

I can meet him tomorrow.	Mate ŋu ado go etsɔ.
I took a step back.	Meɖe afɔ ɖe megbe.

Why it matters to anyone else is just baffling to me.	Nusita wòle vevie na ame bubu aɖe la nye nusi wɔ nuku nam ko.

Something will need to be done.	Ahiã be woawɔ nane.

I know nothing about this guy.	Nyemenya naneke tso ŋutsu sia ŋu o.

This didn’t make much sense to him.	Susu boo aɖeke menɔ esia me nɛ o.

I can help him with that.	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu le ema me.

You have to do better than that.	Ele be nàwɔ nu nyuie wu ema.

I was worried about his mind.	Metsi dzi ɖe eƒe susu ŋu.

And maybe that’s a good thing.	Eye ɖewohĩ nu nyui aɖee nye ema.

If you can listen in life, please do.	Ne àte ŋu aɖo to le agbe me la, taflatse wɔe.
Nothing would surprise me.	Naneke mawɔ nuku nam o.
But it was only a small one.	Gake sue aɖe koe wònye.
He couldn’t get over that.	Mete ŋu ɖu ema dzi o.
There was a problem here.	Kuxi aɖe nɔ afisia.
I had very little space to myself	Teƒe sue aɖe koe nɔ asinye na ɖokuinye
But it wasn’t me.	Gake menye nyee o.
I didn’t feel like he was there	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be ele afima o
There are many good things about this.	Nu nyui geɖe le esia me.
I really enjoyed the whole season	Ɣeyiɣi bliboa katã do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
But a new surprise is coming soon.	Gake nu yeye aɖe si wɔ nuku la gbɔna kpuie.
That caught his eye.	Ema lé eƒe ŋku.

I want to do it myself.	Nye ŋutɔ medi be mawɔe.
Please, take them.	Taflatse, tsɔ wo.

Please come back soon!.	Taflatse trɔ va kaba!.
I resisted the urge to speak out loud	Metsi tre ɖe didi si nɔ menye be maƒo nu sesĩe la ŋu
I would love to share them with you	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be magblɔ wo na mi
What you do with them is what matters.	Nusi nàwɔ kpli wo ye le vevie.
It’s the only place I deserve right now.	Eya koe nye teƒe si dze nam fifia.

I liked that about them though	Ema dzɔ dzi nam le wo ŋu gake
I couldn’t control it.	Nyemete ŋu ɖu edzi o.
And yet it is.	Eye ke hã ele nenema.

But there was no one in the room.	Gake ame aɖeke menɔ xɔa me o.
I decided to take care of things myself	Meɖoe be nye ŋutɔ makpɔ nuwo dzi
It’s a part of you, somewhere.	Wò akpa aɖee wònye, le afi aɖe.

Maybe it will help you focus better.	Ðewohĩ akpe ɖe ŋuwò be wò susu nanɔ nu ŋu nyuie wu.

I was working on the car earlier	Menɔ dɔ wɔm tso ʋua ŋu do ŋgɔ
I have to talk about it.	Ele be maƒo nu tso eŋu.
So far that has worked out pretty well.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ema wɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
We can’t rely on them, we can’t manage them.	Míate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe wo ŋu o, míate ŋu akpɔ wo dzi o.

Now let me tell you something.	Azɔ na magblɔ nya aɖe na wò.
It didn’t make sense but he didn’t care.	Susu menɔ eme o gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
I wasn’t talking to myself, there was someone else there	Menye nye ŋutɔ menɔ nu ƒom na o, ame bubu aɖe hã nɔ afima
But hopefully next week.	Gake míele mɔ kpɔm be ava le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me.
For that matter, there is no issue.	Le nya ma ta la, nya aɖeke mele eme o.
And look, look.	Eye kpɔ ɖa, kpɔ ɖa.
I haven’t seen one yet	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke haɖe o
I don’t want to talk about what just happened	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso nusi dzɔ teti koe nye ema ŋu o
I found him a nice home.	Mekpɔ aƒe nyui aɖe nɛ.

We know the reality.	Míenya nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.

I definitely needed to talk to him.	Ehiã be maƒo nu kplii godoo.
Nothing becomes too important as a result.	Naneke meva nɔa vevie akpa le esia ta o.

He could find few people there to help him.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wòate ŋu akpɔ le afi ma siwo akpe asi ɖe eŋu.
You’re not like that.	Wò ya mele nenema o.
I just told you about one of them.	Ðeko megblɔ wo dometɔ ɖeka na wò.
One car, damaged.	Ʋu ɖeka, si gblẽ.
I have to say I don't know about this	Ele be magblɔ be nyemenya nu tso nya sia ŋu o
Not an exception to this case.	Menye nusi to vovo na nya sia o.
I want to live a normal life	Medi be manɔ agbe si sɔ
People actually laughed.	Amewo ko nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.

It is a difficult task.	Enye dɔ sesẽ aɖe.

I had to get involved.	Ele be maƒo ɖokuinye ɖe eme.
Maybe it’s too obvious.	Ðewohĩ edze ƒã akpa.
And think about it.	Eye bu eŋu kpɔ.
See the following statements.	Kpɔ nya siwo gbɔna la.
I just need a little help.	Ðeko mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu vi aɖe.
I didn’t expect to see anything.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be makpɔ naneke o.

I hope and pray for this for you as well	Mele mɔ kpɔm eye medo gbe ɖa ɖe esia ta na wò hã

But something is very different today.	Gake nane to vovo kura egbea.
The air is with us.	Ya le mía gbɔ.
I wonder who did that	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be amekae wɔ nu ma hã
I have never looked into it	Nyemekpɔ eme kpɔ o
He doesn’t look like me at all.	Medze abe nye ene kura o.
People are so annoying to me.	Amewo doa dziku nam ale gbegbe.
I am happy now, here	Mele dzidzɔ kpɔm fifia, le afisia
He's never backing down from it.	Menye ɖe wòle megbe yim le eŋu gbeɖe o.
I can’t do anything else.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
I can’t go forward	Nyemate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ o
I have witnessed this myself	Nye ŋutɔ mekpɔ esia teƒe
But I couldn’t pay attention	Gake nyemete ŋu lé to ɖe eŋu o
This is different, very different.	Esia to vovo, to vovo kura.
He didn't seem to be coming	Mewɔ abe ɖe mava o ene
I need to pray about this	Ele be mado gbe ɖa tso nya sia ŋu
That’s just weird.	Ema nye nusi wɔ nuku ko.
I couldn’t get my mind off it	Nyemete ŋu ɖe nye susu ɖa le eŋu o
I need to know if this is true	Ele be manya nenye be nya sia nye nyateƒe
Do what you want with it.	Wɔ nusi nèdi kplii.
Maybe we can promise us.	Ðewohĩ míate ŋu ado ŋugbe na mí.
I told him we were on our way	Megblɔ nɛ be míele mɔ dzi
This is also impossible.	Esia hã mate ŋu awɔ o.
There are people here.	Amewo le afisia.
But that’s all of me.	Gake nyee nye ema katã.

But that has passed.	Gake ema va yi.
This may or may not work for you.	Esia ate ŋu awɔ dɔ na wò alo mawɔ dɔ na wò o.
You can keep going.	Àte ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi.
This is quite a lot.	Esia sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
What do you think.	Nukae nèsusu.
There might just be another one.	Ðewohĩ bubu aɖe koe anɔ anyi.
It doesn’t fit.	Medze o.
You can search whatever you want out of it.	Àte ŋu adi nusianu si nèdi tso eme.
And there are many reasons why.	Eye susu geɖe li siwo tae.
My voice sounded unsure.	Nye gbe ɖi nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
Everyone has something.	Nu aɖe le ame sia ame si.
I have already worn two of them	Medo wo dometɔ eve xoxo
I had to sit there and wait	Ele be manɔ anyi ɖe afima anɔ lalam
Everything felt the same.	Nusianu se le eɖokui me nenema ke.

I was glad I was there.	Edzɔ dzi nam be menɔ afima.

It was just something about my face.	Nane si ku ɖe nye mo ŋu koe wònye.
It’s such a complicated process.	Enye ɖoɖo si me kɔ ale gbegbe.
I don’t want him to live alone	Nyemedi be eya ɖeka nanɔ agbe o
I must be missing something	Anɔ eme be nane tom
That kind of life that will kill if necessary.	Agbe ƒomevi ma si awu ame ne ehiã.
I hope this works out well	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia awɔ dɔ nyuie
He calmed down after an hour or two.	Eƒe dzi dze eme le gaƒoƒo ɖeka alo eve megbe.
I know this will happen eventually	Menya be esia ava eme mlɔeba
But there has to be more to it than that.	Gake ele be nu geɖe nanɔ eme wu ema.
There were two of them.	Wo dometɔ eve nɔ anyi.
Build on that.	Tu ɖe ema dzi.
This is nothing at all.	Esia menye naneke kura o.
That suits him well.	Ema sɔ nɛ nyuie.
I'll do it tomorrow.	Mawɔe etsɔ.
I think something must be missing	Mesusu be nane anya bu
He doesn’t care about you, he doesn’t care about himself.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme na wò o, metsɔ ɖeke le eɖokui me o.
I couldn't find one though.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeka ŋu o gake.

I don’t know what happened to him	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi o
If anything, it’s the opposite.	Ne nane li la, ke esia to vovo na ema.

This also works without any problems.	Esia hã wɔa dɔ kuxi aɖeke manɔmee.

It seemed like a good idea at four in the morning.	Edze abe susu nyui aɖee wònye le ŋdi ga ene me ene.
For many reasons.	Le susu geɖe ta.

Everyone did what they liked.	Amesiame wɔ nu si dze eŋu.

I’ve found it.	Meke ɖe eŋu.
I want what is best for you	Medi nusi anyo na wò
He never knew who he was.	Menya amesi wònye gbeɖe o.
Challenge the status quo.	Tsɔ nya ɖe nɔnɔme si li fifia ŋu.
I want to surprise you.	Medi be mawɔ nuku na wò.
I know your face, that’s all	Menya wò mo, ema koe nye ema
Home stayed there for two days.	Aƒe nɔ afima ŋkeke eve.
There was obviously something big behind this book.	Edze ƒã be nu gã aɖe nɔ megbe na agbalẽ sia.
It was so nice to see them having so much fun.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mekpɔ wo wole dzidzɔ kpɔm alea gbegbe.
I wonder who took care of him after that	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be amekae kpɔ edzi le ema megbe hã
I was just really angry.	Ðeko medo dziku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It can’t be morning.	Mate ŋu anye ŋdi o.
Not through this guy.	Menye to ŋutsu sia dzi o.
I really wanted to talk to him	Medi vevie be maƒo nu kplii
Maybe you can find the right one for your project.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu akpɔ esi sɔ na wò dɔa.
It is much more complicated than that.	Enye nusi sesẽ wu ema kura.
This has a couple of drawbacks.	Esia ƒe kuxi eve aɖewo le eŋu.
It’s just a man.	Ŋutsu aɖe koe.
But what can he do? 	Gake nukae wòate ŋu awɔ?
I knew it would come soon	Menya be ava kaba
It would have been interesting.	Anye ne adzɔ dzi na ame hafi.
But we can fight it.	Gake míate ŋu awɔ avu kplii.
I was desperately trying to explain something	Menɔ agbagba dzem vevie be maɖe nane me
I could have ended up the same way, honestly	Nye hã mate ŋu ava wu enu nenema ke hafi, le nyateƒe me
It’s just what you’re asking for.	Nusi biam nèle koe wònye.
I talked to one guy	Meɖo dze kple ŋutsu ɖeka
I hope every night isn’t like this	Mele mɔ kpɔm be zã ɖesiaɖe manɔ alea o
You are a good person.	Ame nyuie nènye.
Some new projects are expected soon.	Wole mɔ kpɔm be woawɔ dɔ yeye aɖewo kpuie.
He didn’t do very well.	Mewɔe nyuie ŋutɔ o.
And one does not know how he got there.	Eye ame menya alesi wòwɔ va ɖo afima o.
Many people he worked with knew.	Ame geɖe siwo wòwɔ dɔ kplii la nya.
It was too much to deal with.	Enye nusi gbɔ eme akpa be woawɔ nu kplii.
I just want what’s inside	Nusi le eme koe medi
I think that sums it up pretty well actually	Mesusu be ema ƒo nu tso eŋu kpuie nyuie ŋutɔ le nyateƒe me
This happened over and over again.	Esia yi edzi zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I don’t understand this	Nyemese nya sia gɔme o
That’s kind of a good thing.	Ema nye nu nyui aɖe ƒomevi.
Probably not a good thing.	Ðewohĩ menye nu nyui aɖeke o.
That was his mistake.	Emae nye eƒe vodada.
However, it is not easy at all.	Ke hã, mele bɔbɔe kura o.
Everyone ate into that	Amesiame ɖu nu le ema me
I can’t do anything about it anyway.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso eŋu le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
We have been taking steps for years.	Míele afɔ ɖem ɖe eŋu ƒe geɖe enye sia.
I recognized every one of them	Mekpɔ wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe dze sii
The problem with food goes further.	Kuxi si le nuɖuɖu ŋu la yi ŋgɔ wu ema.
Some songs might have had a better version.	Ðewohĩ ha aɖewo ƒe akpa aɖe si nyo wu nɔ anyi hafi.
Two men got out of the car.	Ŋutsu eve do le ʋua me.
I can’t really remember now	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi ŋutɔŋutɔ fifia o
I don’t want to at all	Nyemedi kura o
I told them there was no chance	Megblɔ na wo be mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke meli o
I already knew where he was	Menya afisi wònɔ xoxo
I’ve done the same thing to him	Nye hã mewɔ nu ma ke ɖe eŋu kpɔ
Let’s try another one.	Mina míate bubu kpɔ.
He never asked about it.	Mebia nya tso eŋu kpɔ o.
50 schools were also damaged or destroyed	Suku 50 hã gblẽ alo gblẽ wo dome
But few people tried.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe dze agbagba.
If there was time.	Ne ɣeyiɣi nɔ anyi la.
Also its a really nice car.	Azɔ hã eƒe ʋu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I was hoping he would	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be awɔe nenema
I decided to tell him the truth	Meɖoe be magblɔ nyateƒea nɛ
I hope this can help you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
But you know what it’s like.	Gake ènya alesi wòle.
But something more than that.	Gake nane si wu nenema.
I did this for months	Mewɔ esia ɣleti geɖe
It seems like a very long time ago	Edze abe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ va yi ene
I know what needs to be done	Menya nusi wòle be woawɔ
I worked with him one summer	Mewɔ dɔ kplii dzomeŋɔli ɖeka
That’s one good reason not to do this.	Ema nye susu nyui ɖeka si tae mele be míawɔ esia o.
To talk to you.	Be maƒo nu kpli wò.
My very first ever.	Nye gbãtɔ ŋutɔ si mewɔ kpɔ.
I know this is not normal	Menya be esia menye nusi sɔ o
But nothing else would do.	Gake nya bubu aɖeke mawɔ dɔ o.
I wonder if anyone really can	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe ame aɖe ate ŋui ŋutɔŋutɔ hã
This is a great book.	Esia nye agbalẽ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But I can’t do it.	Gake nyemate ŋui o.
I hope you enjoyed this episode	Mele mɔ kpɔm be akpa sia do dzidzɔ na mi
It’s a very bad plan.	Enye ɖoɖo gbegblẽ ŋutɔ aɖe.
He couldn’t speak.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu o.
I don’t understand it that way.	Nyemese egɔme nenema o.
I faced them and simply asked a question	Medze ŋgɔ wo eye mebia nya aɖe ko
He wasn’t very smart either	Medze aɖaŋu tututu hã o
I don’t know what to say.	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ o.
I don’t have to do it.	Mehiã be mawɔe o.
I really like the idea behind what you have here.	Susu si le megbe na nusi le asiwò le afisia la dze ŋunye ŋutɔ.
This is also not expensive.	Esia hã mexɔ asi o.
This is false, and wrong at that.	Esia nye alakpa, eye wònye nu gbegblẽ le ema me.
His head is not in the sand.	Eƒe ta mele ke me o.
I was very happy with it	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ɖe eŋu
The happiest moments of his life.	Ɣeyiɣi siwo me dzidzɔ le wu le eƒe agbe me.
I don’t believe that	Nyemeka ɖe nya ma dzi o
He gave her what he could.	Etsɔ nu si wòate ŋui la nɛ.
I was very impressed with him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ.
This is impossible to happen.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Which is a good thing.	Nusi nye nu nyui aɖe.
But somewhere else.	Gake le teƒe bubu aɖe.
My heart pounded.	Nye dzi ƒo sesĩe.
This is difficult to do.	Esia wɔwɔ sesẽ.
You can be someone.	Àte ŋu anye ame aɖe.
If it was just him, it wouldn’t matter.	Ne eya ɖeka koe la, anye ne manɔ vevie o.
Open your eyes, look at me.	Ʋu ŋku, kpɔm ɖa.
I just gave up now	Meɖe asi le eŋu fifia ko
I have to do this for me	Ele be mawɔ esia nam
This happened over and over again.	Esia dzɔ zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I am by no means alone in this	Menye nye ɖeka koe le esia me kura o
I’m the only one who has	Nye ɖeka koe si
I know exactly where he lives in his house	Menya afisi tututu wòle le eƒe aƒea me
I had something to take my mind off of everything	Nane nɔ asinye maɖe nye susu ɖa le nusianu ŋu
Many of them became pregnant.	Wo dometɔ geɖe fɔ fu.
I don’t think it will work.	Nyemesusu be awɔ dɔ o.
There is no ship.	Meli o.
We can help with that.	Míate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu le ema me.
It was a small town.	Du sue aɖee wònye.
You could have done the same.	Àte ŋu awɔ nenema ke hafi.
Something had to be done.	Ele be woawɔ nane.
Doing two parts.	Akpa eve wɔwɔ.
He could not express these thoughts at all.	Mete ŋu ɖe susu siawo gblɔ kura o.
I can’t see them	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wo o
I could barely concentrate	Nyemete ŋu tsɔ susu ɖo nu ŋu tututu o
I could see everything in them.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nusianu le wo me.
I may have to pick you up	Ate ŋu ahiã be mava xɔ wò
I don’t know without time	Nyemenya ɣeyiɣi aɖeke manɔ eme o
I made a small mistake here	Mewɔ vodada sue aɖe le afisia
On a low level.	Le ɖoɖo si le bɔbɔe dzi.
I don’t want to work on one	Nyemedi be mawɔ dɔ tso ɖeka ŋu o
Some stuff, anyway.	Nu aɖewo, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I tried to avert my eyes	Medze agbagba be maɖe nye ŋku ɖa le eŋu
Many of us have many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe le mía dometɔ geɖe si.
Looks like hair is ready to go.	Edze abe ɖa le klalo be yeayi ene.
I knew something was going on here	Menya be nane le edzi yim le afisia
It didn’t take long.	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
I couldn’t stand it.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
Mele cock ge.	Mele kuku ge.
I’m not here to stay.	Nyemele afisia o.
I was depressed there	Nu te ɖe dzinye le afima
Tell him he will have a nice apartment of his own.	Gblɔ nɛ be eya ŋutɔ ƒe xɔ nyui aɖe anɔ esi.
None of them are like that.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele nenema o.
And you have a good voice.	Eye gbe nyui le asiwò.
I don’t know why anyone would be like that.	Nyemenya nusita ame aɖe anɔ nenema o.
And that’s important.	Eye ema le vevie.
It was a small thing.	Nu sue aɖee wònye.
I don’t know what it is.	Nyemenya nusi wònye o.
Almost simultaneously, two shots rang out.	Le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka kloe me la, tu eve ɖi.
It is my passion.	Enye nye didi vevie.
No one was talking about me.	Ame aɖeke menɔ nu ƒom tso ŋunye o.
I would like to know more about this	Madi be manya nu geɖe tso esia ŋu
I need to get rid of this situation	Ele be maɖe nɔnɔme sia ɖa
Life was harder for him.	Agbe sesẽ nɛ wu.
But I wonder how he managed to get into it.	Gake mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke wòwɔ te ŋu ge ɖe eme hã.
I didn’t expect it to feel this way	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be ase le eɖokui me alea o
I have not been able to find this.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe esia ŋu o.
I have had enough now	Mekpɔ nu sɔ gbɔ nam fifia
Over time, people are looking for something new.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe la, amewo le nu yeye bubu dim.
I heard them clearly.	Mese wo nyuie.
I shouldn’t be angry	Mele be mado dziku o
I want to emphasize that.	Medi be mate gbe ɖe nya ma dzi.
I can’t sit here anymore either.	Nye hã nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi ɖe afisia azɔ o.
Maybe it’s not me talking.	Ðewohĩ menye nyee le nu ƒom o.
I couldn’t kill them.	Nyemete ŋu wu wo o.
I came down on it the wrong way	Meva ɖe edzi le mɔ gbegblẽ nu
I don’t want to or want to.	Nyemedi be mawɔe alo di be mawɔe o.
Much much much much more.	Nu geɖe geɖe wu geɖe wu.
A good brew can help	Aha sesẽ nyui aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu
Come on, meet him.	Va, do go kplii.
But they have a lot of work to do.	Gake dɔ geɖe le wo si woawɔ.
I felt myself fall hard against him	Mese le ɖokuinye me be medze anyi ɖe eŋu sesĩe
He is not like himself today.	Mele abe eya ŋutɔ ene egbea o.
There were so many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi.
I think everyone else did as well.	Mesusu be ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã wɔe nenema ke.
I was going to get sick	Menɔ dɔ lé ge
We don’t know anything about it.	Míenya naneke tso eŋu o.
I think he cares if people trust him	Mesusu be etsɔ ɖe le eme nenye be amewo ka ɖe edzi
But I apologize for what I said earlier	Gake meɖe kuku ɖe nya si megblɔ va yi ta
Very few actually can.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ koe ate ŋui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
What do you think?.	Nukae nèsusu?.
Don’t know why you made such a big deal about it.	Mènya nusita nèwɔ nya gã aɖe tso eŋu nenema gbegbe o.
I think this book should serve two purposes	Mesusu be ele be agbalẽ sia nawɔ dɔ eve
He didn’t take a step.	Meɖe afɔ o.
I care about the people here.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na ame siwo le afisia.
That’s really important today.	Ema le vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ egbea.
My voice is now low.	Nye gbe tsɔ azɔ.
I know your job is hard right now	Menya be wò dɔa sesẽ fifia
There is no one else there.	Ame bubu aɖeke mele afima o.
He had no idea what he had done.	Menya nusi wòwɔ la kura o.
I can’t face another day without you	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe ŋkeke bubu nu wò manɔmee o
I didn’t realize this	Nyemekpɔ esia dze sii o
The first year.	Ƒe gbãtɔ.
Maybe he's talking to himself.	Ðewohĩ ele nu ƒom na eɖokui.
That will usually work.	Zi geɖe la, ema awɔ dɔ.
I am the one who found you	Nyee nye ame si ke ɖe ŋuwò
I need some clothes.	Mehiã awu aɖewo.
Those who are familiar with it.	Ame siwo nya nu tso eŋu nyuie.
There’s no reason why I didn’t survive.	Susu aɖeke meli si tae metsi agbe ɖo o.
I put a lot of work into designing these things.	Mewɔ dɔ geɖe tsɔ wɔ nu siawo ƒe nɔnɔme.
I really need to talk to you	Ehiã be maƒo nu kpli wò vevie ŋutɔ
He wasn’t the only one.	Menye eya ɖeka koe o.
However, that will work.	Ke hã, ema awɔ dɔ.
I really want this to work	Medi vevie be esia nawɔ dɔ
I want you to say that	Medi be nàgblɔ nya ma
There is a big hole in it.	Do gã aɖe le eme.
He could not talk or stand.	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu alo tsi tre o.
I have told you this	Megblɔ nya sia na mi
He couldn’t get enough.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ o.
No one recognized his face.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ eƒe mo dze sii o.
That’s important and clear.	Ema le vevie eye eme kɔ nyuie.
This surprised me a lot.	Esia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
The police had just left.	Ðeko kpovitɔwo dzo teti koe nye ema.
I don’t have to do that.	Mehiã be mawɔe nenema o.
He was brilliant in many ways.	Edze aɖaŋu le mɔ geɖe nu.
They will all work well.	Wo katã woawɔ dɔ nyuie.
It’s a deserted road.	Enye mɔ si dzi ame aɖeke mele o.
I know how much it means to you	Menya ale si gbegbe wòle vevie na wò
I think this project is going really well	Mesusu be dɔ sia le edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔ
We can’t tell you what’s best for you here.	Míate ŋu agblɔ nusi nyo na wò le afisia o.
He worked hard.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe.
I think now is a good time	Mesusu be fifia nye ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe
I know it’s not that easy	Menya be mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o
He doesn’t do this very often.	Mewɔa esia zi geɖe o.
You know that this is true.	Ènya be nya sia nye nyateƒe.
A little bit of that	Ema ƒe akpa sue aɖe
There is a cost to it.	Ga aɖe le eŋu.
Please, come and join us.	Taflatse, va kpe ɖe mía ŋu.
I didn’t know you had that skill	Nyemenya be aɖaŋu ma le asiwò o
Anything is possible here.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ le afisia.
I knew something was wrong	Menya be nane gblẽ
I don’t think anything can	Nyemesusu be naneke ate ŋui o
Expect it to be expensive.	Kpɔ mɔ be axɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I felt like a completely different person.	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ame bubu kura ene.
He didn’t resist it.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu o.
How long ago that was.	Ɣeyiɣi didi kae nye ema va yi.
I didn’t know you were here	Nyemenya be èle afisia o
I don’t know, and ultimately it doesn’t matter	Nyemenya o, eye mlɔeba la, mehiã o
I didn’t really expect to	Nyemekpɔ mɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ be mawɔe o
We were so excited.	Dzi dzɔ mí ale gbegbe.
This can’t be good!.	Esia mate ŋu anye nyui o!.
It’s been like this for a month.	Ɣleti ɖeka enye sia si wòle alea.
It was a very difficult job.	Enye dɔ sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can’t deny him this	Nyemate ŋu agbe nya sia nɛ o
Everyone was very happy.	Amesiame kpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
Maybe that could work.	Ðewohĩ ema ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
It was a great opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖee wònye.
If you are in it, of course.	Ne èle eme ya.
Here, look .	Le afisia la, kpɔ ɖa .
One death means something.	Ku ɖeka fia nane.
He is running very fast.	Ele du dzi vevie ŋutɔ.
I just can’t do it on my own	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔe le ɖokuinye si o
You can’t escape it.	Màte ŋu asi le eme o.
He lost his mind.	Eƒe susu dzo le eŋu.
I couldn’t answer him	Nyemete ŋu ɖo eŋu nɛ o
It’s a little busy here.	Vovo mele eŋu vie le afisia o.
I almost know what happened because of that	Menya nusi dzɔ kloe le ema ta
I know what you’re going to say.	Menya nya si nàgblɔ.
I am so surprised to see you here today	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ be mekpɔ wò le afisia egbea
But there is only one problem.	Gake kuxi ɖeka koe.
I wanted to have a solid home somehow	Medi be aƒe sesẽ aɖe nanɔ asinye le mɔ aɖe nu
Nothing could save them.	Naneke mete ŋu xɔ wo o.
He didn’t say anything to them.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke na wo o.
Only you know your own mind.	Wò ɖeka koe nya wò ŋutɔ wò susu.
It never really is.	Mele nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
Two contrasting results.	Nu eve siwo do tso eme siwo to vovo.
I can take them from you	Mate ŋu axɔ wo le asiwò
It is important that we can understand that.	Ele vevie be míate ŋu ase nya ma gɔme.
And there is no tomorrow.	Eye etsɔ aɖeke meli o.
I see them there now, pairs of feet	Mekpɔ wo le afima fifia, afɔ eve eve
Get some stuff done, already.	Na woawɔ nu aɖewo, xoxo.
He can really rely on it.	Ate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He seems to have a heart.	Edze abe dzi le esi ene.
Everything is over.	Nusianu wu enu.
I can’t take my eyes off her	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nye ŋku ɖa le eŋu o
But of course, you will also have your own room.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, wò ŋutɔ wò xɔ hã anɔ asiwò.
Too hard on him.	Sesẽ akpa ɖe eŋu.
Remove any path he can.	Ðe mɔ ɖesiaɖe si wòate ŋui la ɖa.
That thing is in it.	Nu ma le eme.
In fact, it is in some homes.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele aƒe aɖewo me.
It must have been a difficult problem.	Anɔ eme be enye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
I didn’t see anything in them	Nyemekpɔ naneke le wo me o
I might get two shots	Ðewohĩ makpɔ tu eve
Here things are different.	Le afisia la, nuwo to vovo.
But I don’t think we should do that here	Gake nyemesusu be ele be míawɔ esia le afisia o
I would admire him more for that	Makpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu geɖe wu ɖe ema ta
That was the first one.	Emae nye gbãtɔ.
I work much better at home	Mewɔa dɔ nyuie wu le aƒeme ŋutɔ
It just is.	Ðeko wòle.
I had never seen his face	Nyemekpɔ eƒe mo kpɔ o
If only he had a sword.	Ne ɖe yi le esi.
I don’t want to deal with that	Nyemedi be makpɔ ema gbɔ o
That could probably happen to just one person as well.	Anɔ eme be ema ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe ame ɖeka ko dzi hã.
I could stay here all night	Mate ŋu anɔ afisia zã bliboa katã
I'm not ready for that.	Nyemele klalo na ema o.
I didn’t have any children	Vi aɖeke menɔ asinye o
Many people have made that mistake.	Ame geɖe wɔ vodada ma.
It could have been something else.	Ate ŋu anye nu bubu aɖe hafi.
I want to know where they are	Medi be manya afi si wole
But you are the one who can help you.	Gake wòe nye ame si ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
But things are different.	Gake nuwo to vovo.
This didn’t surprise him.	Esia mewɔ nuku nɛ o.
As if he were enjoying himself.	Abe ɖe wòle dzidzɔ kpɔm ene.
These things are alive.	Nu siawo le agbe.
I think that is the closest parallel	Mesusu be emae nye nusi sɔ kplii wu
I didn’t mean to come on so hard	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mava sesĩe nenema gbegbe o
I think things are really complicated	Mesusu be nuwo sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ
I headed there right after work	Meɖo ta afima le dɔ megbe teti
He is also a	Eya hã nye .
I was definitely impressed	Mewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye godoo
His attention is focused on me.	Eƒe susu katã le dzinye.
We don’t know what he did.	Míenya nu si wòwɔ o.
Still, it’s worth doing what we can.	Ke hã, anyo be míawɔ nusi míate ŋui.
I now know two things	Menya nu eve azɔ
I just said that.	Ðeko megblɔ be.
I just had to try.	Ðeko wòle be mate kpɔ.
I couldn’t think of anything	Nyemete ŋu bu naneke ŋu o
I think he wanted the same for me	Mesusu be eya hã di nenema ke nam
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I am interested in it now.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme fifia.
All of us, on the same side.	Mí katã, le akpa ɖeka dzi.
He might have been angry with me.	Ðewohĩ ado dziku ɖe ŋunye hafi.
It seems that	Edze abe .
These services are not available to everyone.	Menye ame sia ame koe ate ŋu akpɔ dɔ siawo o.
Maybe that’s his problem too.	Ðewohĩ emae nye eya hã ƒe kuxi.
Or some other time.	Alo ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖe.
Wear them now too.	Do wo fifia hã.
I couldn’t remember what it was	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku nusi wònye dzi o

Or maybe just common sense.	Alo ɖewohĩ susu nyui ko.

It can work for you, it can work for you.	Ate ŋu awɔ dɔ ɖe ŋuwò, ate ŋu awɔ dɔ na wò.
No one knows what time it is.	Ame aɖeke menya ɣeyiɣi si me wòle o.

You can do that.	Àte ŋu awɔ ema.

I just hope it works out in some way	Ðeko mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ ɖe edzi le mɔ aɖe nu
It’s really amazing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I already had his heart	Eƒe dzi nɔ asinye xoxo
It will be good for him.	Anyo nɛ.
He had that honor.	Bubu ma nɔ esi.
You can do either in this case.	Àte ŋu awɔ wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe le go sia me.
We will fight.	Míawɔ avu.
I didn’t understand anything about it.	Nyemese naneke gɔme le eŋu o.
All to no avail.	Wo katã meɖe vi aɖeke o.
I have so much to look forward to.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye makpɔ mɔ na.
I would have taken care of it.	Anye ne makpɔ edzi hafi.
I knew what was going on.	Menya nusi nɔ edzi yim.
His face twisted in anger.	Eƒe mo trɔ le dziku ta.
There was no space.	Teƒe menɔ anyi o.
I have no other skills.	Aɖaŋu bubu aɖeke mele asinye o.
I am convinced of this	Meka ɖe nya sia dzi
I tried to talk to you	Medze agbagba be maƒo nu kpli wò
We were very impressed with everyone.	Amesiame ƒe nu lé dzi na mí ŋutɔ.
And the fire	Kple dzo la .
I can get out of it myself	Nye ŋutɔ mate ŋu ado le eme
I just need someone to help me with this	Ðeko mehiã ame aɖe si akpe ɖe ŋunye le esia me
I should be able to understand everything now	Ele be mate ŋu ase nuwo katã gɔme fifia
But now it’s really easy.	Gake fifia ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That can be both good and bad.	Ema ate ŋu anye nu nyui kple nu gbegblẽ siaa.
You are not going to win.	Menye ɖe nèle dzi ɖu ge o.
I work on it alone.	Nye ɖeka mewɔa dɔ tso eŋu.
I told him he had to have surgery	Megblɔ nɛ be ele be woawɔ dɔ nɛ
Stay that way.	Nɔ nenema.
I couldn’t change his mind	Nyemete ŋu trɔ eƒe susu o
That is a very different matter.	Ema nye nya si to vovo kura.
I want to be closer to people	Medi be mate ɖe amewo ŋu wu
I think it will help you	Mesusu be akpe ɖe ŋuwò
It hurt us so much.	Eve mí ŋutɔ.
Also a slightly different situation quite often.	Azɔ hã nɔnɔme si to vovo vie zi geɖe ŋutɔ.
I remember how people looked at me.	Meɖo ŋku ale si amewo kpɔm la dzi.
I just can’t help it	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso eŋu o
For a very good job.	Le dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ ta.
After what happened.	Le nusi dzɔ la megbe.
There has to be a better way.	Ele be mɔ si nyo wu nanɔ anyi.
That’s worth it.	Ema dze.
Right now, of course, everyone seems to have one.	Fifia ya, edze abe ɖeka le amesiame si ene ya.
I know what his reputation is like	Menya alesi ŋkɔ nyui si le eŋu la le
Things just happened.	Ðeko nuwo dzɔ.
I want to have a great career	Medi be dɔ gã aɖe nanɔ asinye

I wondered if he was planning this too	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe wònɔ ɖoɖo wɔm ɖe esia hã ŋu hã
I felt so bad about myself	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye lãme gblẽ ale gbegbe
And in me, for that matter.	Eye le menye, le nya ma ta.
I am a better person because of it.	Menye ame si nyo wu le esia ta.
He wasn’t busy.	Vovo menɔ eŋu o.
Not for a very long time.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ o.
I was right behind them.	Menɔ wo megbe tututu.
Like everything is fine now.	Abe alesi nusianu le nyuie fifia ene.
I have no roots here	Ke aɖeke mele asinye le afisia o
Come to my room.	Va nye xɔ me.
There is more to it than that.	Nu geɖe le eme wu esia.
Few people were like that.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ nenema.
But it’s a different kind.	Gake ƒomevi bubu aɖee.
What people want is quick, effective action.	Nusi amewo di enye be woawɔ nu kaba, si awɔ dɔ nyuie.
I deserved what happened to me	Medze na nusi dzɔ ɖe dzinye
However the first real first time will not come before this day.	Ke hã zi gbãtɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ gbãtɔ mado ŋgɔ na ŋkeke sia o.
And that’s the easy part.	Eye emae nye akpa si le bɔbɔe.
I was just really angry	Ðeko medo dziku ŋutɔŋutɔ
I could see them in another car	Mete ŋu kpɔa wo le ʋu bubu me
If you have something, someone wants it.	Ne nane le asiwò la, ame aɖe di nɛ.
I should never have gone.	Mele be mayi gbeɖe o hafi.
I never really understood	Nyemese egɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o
He has nothing else.	Nu bubu aɖeke mele esi o.
I was expecting a little	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na vi aɖe
I couldn’t keep them.	Nyemete ŋu lé wo ɖe te o.
That went pretty well.	Ema yi edzi nyuie ŋutɔ.
I would have been happy.	Adzɔ dzi nam hafi.
I know where to find all sorts of things	Menya afisi makpɔ nu ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe le
He didn’t get them.	Mexɔ wo o.
I don’t want to know the truth myself.	Nye ŋutɔ nyemedi be manya nyateƒea o.
I just grew up enough, that’s all	Ðeko metsi nyuie, ema koe nye ema
He doesn’t deserve this.	Medze na esia o.
But he never cared about her.	Gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ kpɔ o.
I was surprised he had the money	Ewɔ nuku nam be ga la le esi
Now that’s two.	Fifia ema nye eve.
I came by to see what it was like.	Meva to afima be makpɔ alesi wòle.
He has some money.	Ga aɖe le esi.
I didn’t have to do anything with it though	Mehiã be mawɔ naneke kplii ya o
I think that would be good for him	Mesusu be ema anyo nɛ
This may take some time.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I wanted to do something new.	Medi be mawɔ nu yeye aɖe.
We know we are in it.	Míenya be míele eme.
I need some water.	Mehiã tsi aɖe.
That was so true a week ago.	Ema nye nyateƒe ale gbegbe kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia.
Good thing no one asked you.	Nu nyui aɖee nye be ame aɖeke mebia wò o.
It was just a lie.	Alakpa koe wònye.
I don’t know what job I’m going to do	Nyemenya dɔ si mawɔ o
There is another problem with this.	Kuxi bubu aɖe hã le esia ŋu.
None of them did anything	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ naneke o
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I have a problem here	Kuxi aɖe le ŋunye le afisia
We are finding out why he did this.	Míele nusita wòwɔ esia la dim.
I showed up in full costume	Meɖe eɖokui fia kple awu bliboa
There wasn’t much joy in that.	Dzidzɔ boo aɖeke menɔ ema me o.
There was nothing he could do about that.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ tso ema ŋu o.
Or on the other hand.	Alo le go bubu me.
I was wondering if anyone here could help	Menɔ ɖokuinye biam be ɖe ame aɖe le afisia ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye hã
The work is personal.	Dɔa nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
I don’t know his name	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ o
I can see better now	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu nyuie wu fifia
We will have no issue.	Nya aɖeke manɔ mía si o.
I found another way	Mekpɔ mɔ bubu aɖe
This is justified for a couple of reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo ta koe esia sɔ ɖo.
The police are amazing.	Kpovitɔwo wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I can do anything.	Mate ŋu awɔ nusianu.
I didn’t like the way he was acting	Ale si wònɔ nu wɔm la medze ŋunye o
You’re fine now.	Èle nyuie fifia.
Pretty much something for everyone.	Nane kloe na amesiame.
That’s why we don’t know what to do about it.	Esia tae míenya nusi míawɔ tso eŋu o.
He couldn’t understand it.	Mete ŋu se egɔme o.
I really don’t see how to do it here.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemekpɔ alesi mawɔe le afisia o.
I could do this all day	Mate ŋu awɔ esia ŋkeke bliboa
He couldn’t explain it.	Mete ŋu ɖe eme o.
I am praying too.	Nye hã mele gbe dom ɖa.
But he could not prove it.	Gake mete ŋu ɖo kpe edzi o.
It never existed.	Menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
I know exactly what that means	Menya nusi tututu ema fia
Actually, for two reasons.	Le nyateƒe me la, susu eve aɖewo tae.
I was deeply moved by his heart	Eƒe dzi wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
It can handle whatever you have.	Ate ŋu akpɔ nusianu si le asiwò gbɔ.
It was part of the reason he was here, of course.	Enye nusita wònɔ afisia ƒe akpa aɖe ya.
If he hadn’t done that	Ne ɖe mewɔ nu ma o la, anye ne mewɔe nenema o
That someone said something to him than please.	Be ame aɖe gblɔ nya aɖe nɛ wu taflatse.
I think my heart stopped too	Mesusu be nye dzi hã tɔ te
I was completely surprised	Ewɔ nuku nam kura
I will have to shake your hand	Ahiã be maƒo asi na wò
He went himself.	Eya ŋutɔ yi.
Just a part of you.	Wò akpa aɖe ko.
Come here.	Va afisia.
Nothing seems to be working for that.	Edze abe naneke mele dɔ wɔm na ema o ene.
I want to be happy	Medi be makpɔ dzidzɔ
It’s a good idea.	Enye susu nyui aɖe.
He won't fight, tomorrow.	Mawɔ avu o, etsɔ.
But there are also many disadvantages.	Gake nu geɖe siwo gblẽ le eŋu hã li.
I have to congratulate you	Ele be mado dzidzɔ na wò
I have some things at home	Nu aɖewo le asinye le aƒeme
I was always against it	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu ɣesiaɣi
Part of the building.	Xɔa ƒe akpa aɖe.
I need you to say something	Mehiã be nàgblɔ nya aɖe
Think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ.
I wish he hadn’t done that.	Ne ɖe mewɔe nenema o la, anye ne mewɔe nenema o.
I couldn’t help it, but I was satisfied.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o, gake nye dzi dze eme.
I tried to imagine her face but couldn’t	Medze agbagba be makpɔ eƒe mo le susu me gake nyemete ŋui o
He seemed to have a mind of his own	Edze abe susu aɖe nɔ esi le eɖokui si ene
I don’t know what that means.	Nyemenya nusi ema fia o.
I think that’s a good point	Mesusu be nya nyui aɖee nye ema
I got this from here	Mekpɔ esia tso afisia
I ordered two more.	Mebia eve bubu.
He didn’t say unreasonable things today.	Nya siwo me susu mele o megblɔ egbea o.
This will not allow anyone.	Esia maɖe mɔ na ame aɖeke o.
Look, look! 	Kpɔ ɖa, kpɔ ɖa!
I will do more than that.	Mawɔ nu geɖe wu ema ko.
I can do them all.	Mate ŋu awɔ wo katã.
I just couldn’t think of that	Ðeko nyemete ŋu bu nya ma ŋu o
There had been a lot, after all.	Nu geɖe nɔ anyi kpɔ, le nyateƒe me.
None of us had ever seen anything like it	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o
The person who filed the complaint.	Ame si tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu.
I got a little too close	Mete ɖe ŋunye vie akpa
Something to do, finally.	Nane si woawɔ, mlɔeba.
It’s actually the same problem.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye kuxi ma ke.
I should have fought harder	Ðe wòle be mawɔ avu sesĩe wu hafi
It just doesn’t work.	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ o.
I would like to do that.	Madi be mawɔe nenema.
I was almost on my own.	Menɔ ɖokuinye si kloe.
Generally the same thing.	Zi geɖe la, nu ɖeka ma ke.
A very little bit.	Vi aɖe ŋutɔ.
You can do anything.	Àte ŋu awɔ nusianu.
However, this doesn’t seem to work for me.	Ke hã, edze abe esia mewɔa dɔ nam o ene.
I was going through my stuff	Menɔ nye nuwo me tom
I have to do that, of course	Ele be mawɔe nenema ya
I think that’s a better word for it	Mesusu be emae nye nya si nyo wu na esia
We’re going to have a conversation.	Míele dze ɖo ge.
I was very wrong about that.	Mewɔ vodada le nya ma ŋu ŋutɔ.
You can’t control everything at every moment.	Màte ŋu aɖu nusianu dzi le ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe me o.
I know this person.	Menya ame sia.
Give it any name you like.	Na ŋkɔ ɖesiaɖe si dze ŋuwò.
I knew this time would come	Menya be ɣeyiɣi sia ava
That makes sense.	Susu le nya ma me.
I started to get angry	Meva nɔ dziku dom
I want to emphasize all that	Medi be mate gbe ɖe nya ma katã dzi
He had a good idea, too.	Susu nyui aɖe nɔ esi, eya hã.
I can’t always get them	Nyemate ŋu axɔ wo ɣesiaɣi o
Honestly, this didn’t bother me	Le nyateƒe me la, esia meɖe fu nam o
It was also very quick.	Ewɔ kaba ŋutɔ hã.
I don’t know what you’re going to say	Nyemenya nya si nàgblɔ o
The operation should only be performed once.	Zi ɖeka koe wòle be woawɔ dɔa.
I listened for a long time.	Meɖo to ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
But so many deaths.	Gake ku geɖe ŋutɔ.
It was more than we could have hoped for in every way.	Enye nusi wu alesi míate ŋu akpɔ mɔ na le go sia go me.
I was hoping it would work	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ
He has a searching heart.	Dzi si le nu dim le esi.
The king looked up.	Fia la fɔ mo dzi.
Maybe I did that.	Ðewohĩ mewɔe nenema.
I know how things used to be	Menya alesi nuwo nɔ tsã
I could already feel his heart	Mete ŋu se eƒe dzi gɔme xoxo
Something really annoyed me	Nya aɖe do dziku nam ŋutɔ
There was no exception.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi si to vovo na ema o.
Only one week!.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka koe!.
He tried to fight it.	Edze agbagba be yeawɔ avu kplii.
It is what it is.	Enye nusi wònye.
They are starting in it.	Wole egɔme dzem le eme.
I never wanted to work for anyone else	Nyemedi gbeɖe be mawɔ dɔ na ame bubu aɖeke o
I tried to imagine what that might be like	Medze agbagba be makpɔ alesi ema ate ŋu anɔ le susu me
I fought the urge to fight him	Mewɔ avu kple didi be mawɔ avu kplii
Not very well.	Menye nyuie ŋutɔ o.
I will see you more often.	Makpɔ wò zi geɖe wu.
He did this in many ways	Ewɔ esia le mɔ geɖe nu
Open your mind.	Ʋu wò susu.
I can’t just run away	Nyemate ŋu asi ko o
In the city of never.	Le du si me gbeɖe o la me.
I know what this means to you	Menya nu si esia fia na wò
I was very impressed with him	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
He wasn’t a character.	Menye ame aɖee wònye o.
I tried to apologize	Medze agbagba be maɖe kuku
Come and see us.	Va kpɔ mí ɖa.
There is an obvious parallel.	Nusi sɔ kple wo nɔewo si dze ƒã la li.
I told him it wouldn’t work that way	Megblɔ nɛ be mawɔ dɔ nenema o
I thought something was wrong with my face	Mesusu be nane gblẽ le nye mo ŋu
I am with them.	Mele wo gbɔ.
What is that.	Nukae nye ema.
I doubt it very much though	Meke ɖi le eŋu ŋutɔ gake
I was looking forward to home by now	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na aƒe vaseɖe fifia
He wouldn’t do anything at all.	Mawɔ naneke kura o.
You just don’t know everything.	Ðeko mènya nusianu o.
I can’t imagine an alternative	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ bubu ɖe eteƒe le susu me o
I only saw one person, a man	Ame ɖeka koe mekpɔ, ŋutsu aɖe
I had to do something.	Ele be mawɔ nane.
There was a man with them.	Ŋutsu aɖe nɔ wo gbɔ.
That’s me going.	Ema me kɔ.
There is no time limit.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli o.
I think this is a great treat for you	Mesusu be esia nye nuɖuɖu gã aɖe na wò
He didn’t care about that.	Metsɔ ɖeke le nya ma me o.
I certainly hope not you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm godoo be menye wòe o.
I need another drink.	Mehiã aha bubu.
Clearly, this is not the case.	Edze ƒã be esia mele alea o.
I didn’t understand it at all	Nyemese egɔme kura o
That’s pretty extreme.	Ema nye nusi gbɔ eme ŋutɔ.
But something else was at work here.	Gake nu bubu aɖe nɔ dɔ wɔm le afisia.
Do the same for the project task.	Wɔ nenema ke na dɔa ƒe dɔ si woawɔ.
I was actually able to get a job.	Le nyateƒe me la, mete ŋu kpɔ dɔ aɖe.
I want to say something.	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖe.
Here, two points are in order.	Le afisia la, nya eve aɖewo le ɖoɖo nu.
I can’t do another one.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ bubu aɖeke o.
No one knows where the bottom of this thing is.	Ame aɖeke menya afisi nu sia ƒe gɔme le o.
Nothing more important now.	Naneke mele vevie wu ema fifia o.
I told him what had happened	Megblɔ nusi dzɔ la nɛ
That’s one problem.	Ema nye kuxi ɖeka.
It just took me a while to get there	Ðeko mexɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe hafi ɖo afima
I realize so much now	Mekpɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ dze sii fifia
He didn’t know about that.	Menya nu tso nya ma ŋu o.
And the dog.	Kple avu la.
I listened carefully, but heard nothing	Meɖo to nyuie, gake nyemese naneke o
This whole life.	Agbe sia katã.
It’s been a long time coming.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si gbɔna.

I think that’s me.	Mesusu be nyee nye ema.
He never had a mortgage or car loan.	Aƒe alo ʋu ƒe fe aɖeke medo nɛ kpɔ o.
No real job, no real job.	Dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke meli o, dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke meli o.
He wasn’t there.	Menɔ afima o.
I knew what he was doing	Menya nusi wɔm wòle
That is a very good thing.	Ema nye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I wanted him to act strong beyond reason	Medi be wòawɔ nu sesĩe si gbɔ susu ŋu
I have only one word for you	Nya ɖeka koe le asinye na wò
The lake is already open anyway.	Ta la ʋu xoxo le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
If only he had time.	Ne ɖe ɣeyiɣi nɔ esi.
A little extra.	Vi aɖe kpe ɖe eŋu.
It is probably the same.	Anɔ eme be ele nenema ke.
Only four suspected something else.	Ame ene koe bu fɔ nu bubu aɖe.
I just got one.	Ðeko mexɔ ɖeka.
I was just as angry as he was, if not more so	Nye hã medo dziku abe eya ke ene, ne menye wu nenema o hã
I will be here with you	Manɔ afisia kpli wò
Yet there was much truth in these extremes.	Ke hã nyateƒe geɖe nɔ nya siawo siwo gbɔ eme la me.
I needed something new and exciting	Mehiã nu yeye aɖe si doa dzidzɔ nam

There is nothing more any of us can do.	Naneke meli si mía dometɔ aɖeke ate ŋu awɔ wu ema o.
There is more money involved.	Ga geɖe wu le eme.
I knew he didn’t care	Menya be metsɔ ɖeke le eme o
I can’t imagine a child dying	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ɖevi aɖe ƒe ku le susu me o
I have to get out of the house now	Ele be mado le aƒea me fifia
I am so happy to share this very great news	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be magblɔ nya gã sia ŋutɔ
He can let it go.	Ate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu.
But it really doesn’t matter.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mehiã o.
I knew something was wrong	Menya be nu gbegblẽ aɖe gblẽ
No one rebuked him.	Ame aɖeke meka mo nɛ o.
But it still didn’t work.	Gake mewɔ dɔ kokoko o.

I asked myself to talk to him	Mebia ɖokuinye be maƒo nu kplii
I need a good face on this.	Mehiã mo nyui aɖe le esia ŋu.

But in reality, it wasn’t.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, menɔ nenema o.
All the people.	Amewo katã.
I was right behind him	Menɔ megbe nɛ tututu
Make a plan for it.	Wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
Everyone was very excited about this.	Dzi dzɔ amesiame ŋutɔ ɖe esia ŋu.
It’s not what our job is.	Menye nusi míaƒe dɔ nyee o.

And yet! 	Eye ke hã!

Maybe he had a point.	Ðewohĩ nya aɖe nɔ esi.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Not you, not me, not that child’s death.	Menye wò o, menye nye o, menye ɖevi ma ƒe ku o.
I hope so, anyway.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I just got there a little late	Ðeko meɖo afima tsi megbe vie

I said open your mouth.	Megblɔ be ʋu wò nu.
I have someone working on it now	Ame aɖe le asinye le dɔ wɔm tso eŋu fifia

Everything is a loss.	Nu sia nu nye nu si bu.
But only in your mind and heart.	Gake le wò susu kple dzi me koe.
But this may not be of much use.	Gake ɖewohĩ esia maɖe vi boo aɖeke o.
I don’t have a job.	Dɔ aɖeke mele asinye o.

I think it was a project that was going pretty well	Mesusu be enye dɔ si nɔ edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔ
And after that.	Eye le ema megbe la.

Keep your bottom line.	Na wò gɔme nanɔ eme.
I didn’t really have a life	Agbe aɖeke menɔ asinye ŋutɔŋutɔ o
It felt empty.	Mese le eɖokui me be naneke mele eŋu o.
I can’t handle this on top of everything else	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ ɖe nu bubu ɖesiaɖe dzi o
But I was a little nervous today	Gake metsi dzodzodzoe vie egbea
I just can’t talk about it	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aƒo nu tso eŋu o
He had nothing so much.	Naneke menɔ esi nenema gbegbe o.
I’m not the only one who does this.	Menye nye ɖeka koe wɔa esia o.
I like money.	Ga dzɔa dzi nam.
I couldn’t figure out what he was doing	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi wɔm wònɔ la dze sii o
He is talking to himself.	Ele nu ƒom na eɖokui.
I didn’t know this thing existed	Nyemenya be nu sia li o
That we know.	Ema míenya.

I just threw my life away	Ðeko metsɔ nye agbe ƒu gbe
I also felt your anger	Mese wò dziku hã le ɖokuinye me
For these reasons.	Susu siawo tae.
I pray you, look into that.	Medo gbe ɖa na wò, kpɔ ema ŋu.
And that’s really enough.	Eye ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I was desperately hoping I wouldn’t	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm vevie be mawɔe o
I have better things to do.	Nu siwo nyo wu le asinye mawɔ.
That it was just one big thing.	Be nu gã ɖeka koe wònye.
It was very impressive for all of us.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe mía katã dzi ŋutɔ.
And he had it.	Eye wònɔ esi.
He didn’t understand.	Mese egɔme o.
That you.	Be wò.
I can’t go again.	Nyemate ŋu ayi ake o.
I really don’t know anything about it	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o
Some people need help.	Ame aɖewo hiã kpekpeɖeŋu.
I liked his name.	Eƒe ŋkɔ dze ŋunye.
I can’t understand this situation.	Nyemate ŋu ase nɔnɔme sia gɔme o.
I have to live with nothing and no one	Ele be manɔ agbe kple naneke si mele asinye o eye ame aɖeke manɔ asinye o
I paused, not knowing what to do	Metsi tre vie, nyemenya nusi mawɔ o
It’s more than enough.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ wu.
There is a house on that road.	Aƒe aɖe le mɔ ma dzi.
I wondered what that was	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae nye ema hã
Now I’m officially better	Fifia me nyo wu le se nu
Turn to me, focus on me here.	Trɔ ɖe ŋunye, lé fɔ ɖe ŋunye le afisia.
He never saw who he was.	Mekpɔ amesi wònye kpɔ o.
I think that’s the most interesting part of it.	Mesusu be emae nye eƒe akpa si doa dzidzɔ na ame wu.
Obviously, this can take some time.	Edze ƒã be esia ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
This can work.	Esia ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
If only there was another way	Ne ɖe mɔ bubu aɖe nanɔ anyi la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
He didn’t know you were here.	Menya be èle afisia o.
It worked for us.	Ewɔ dɔ na mí.
I’m happy about that	Edzɔ dzi nam ɖe ema ŋu
I’m just talking to myself	Nye ɖeka koe mele nu ƒom na
I understood what he was going through.	Mese nusi me tom wònɔ la gɔme.
He had been thinking about it.	Eƒe susu nɔ eŋu kpɔ.
None of them were wearing any clothes.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke medo awu aɖeke o.
That has hurt me before	Ema gblẽ nu le ŋunye kpɔ
The word came out.	Nya la do go.
I can’t understand it	Nyemate ŋu ase egɔme o
He had never lived here.	Menɔ afisia kpɔ o.
I saw things differently	Mekpɔ nuwo le mɔ bubu nu
It was just so quick.	Ðeko wòwɔ kaba nenema gbegbe.
You know some of my qualities.	Ènya nye nɔnɔme aɖewo.
I am the person according to me.	Nyee nye ame si le nye nya nu.
I am desperately looking for anyone who can help	Medi ame sia ame si ate ŋu ana kpekpeɖeŋu la vevie
Have a nice year.	Ƒe nyui aɖe.
The news came a few days later.	Nya la va le ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo megbe.
Have a very good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nanɔ asiwò.
I can't	Nyemate ŋui o
Maybe this saved you.	Ðewohĩ esia xɔ na wò.
In these cases, any fault.	Le nɔnɔme siawo me la, vodada ɖesiaɖe.
I wasn’t backing down on this	Menye ɖe menɔ megbe yim le esia ŋu o
You are seeking truth for a reason.	Susu aɖe tae nèle nyateƒe dim ɖo.
I have done this over and over again.	Mewɔ esia zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
He himself is dirty.	Eya ŋutɔ hã ƒo ɖi.
I don’t know what made me nervous	Nyemenya nusi na metsi dzodzodzoe o
I knew he wasn’t in a very good place	Menya be mele teƒe nyui aɖeke tututu o
I’m still not sure exactly what it is	Nyemeka ɖe nusi tututu wònye dzi haɖe o
He wasn't sure he could get up again.	Meka ɖe edzi be yeate ŋu afɔ ake o.
I'm fine with it.	Mele nyuie le eŋu.
He couldn’t be sure.	Mete ŋu ka ɖe edzi o.
That doesn’t necessarily work.	Ema mewɔa dɔ kokoko o.
I didn’t want to upset him at work	Nyemedi be mado dziku nɛ le dɔme o
I want to know about tonight	Medi be manya nu tso zã sia ŋu
I looked good somehow	Medze nyuie le mɔ aɖe nu
I saw death in people’s faces.	Mekpɔ ku le amewo ƒe mo.
There was no mistake.	Vodada aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
It made my day, thank you so much.	Ewɔ nye ŋkeke, akpe geɖe na wò.
I gave my heart away	Metsɔ nye dzi na
I couldn’t look at any of them	Nyemete ŋu lé ŋku ɖe wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o
But look at you.	Gake kpɔ wò ɖa.
I can’t take anything else missing	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nu bubu aɖeke si bu o
I came across one.	Meva ke ɖe ɖeka ŋu.
I have a few problems here.	Kuxi ʋɛ aɖewo le ŋunye le afisia.
I’ll make it easy for you	Nye ya mawɔ nu bɔbɔe na wò
Everything seems to be there.	Edze abe nusianu le afima ene.
It was odd though.	Enye nusi mewɔ nuku o ke hã.
Go ahead and have your say.	Yi ŋgɔ nàgblɔ wò nya.
You don’t have time.	Ɣeyiɣi mele asiwò o.
If necessary.	Ne ehiã la.
It doesn’t do very much.	Mewɔa nu geɖe ŋutɔ o.
I can do without anything else	Mate ŋu awɔe nu bubu aɖeke manɔmee
It’s a new thing.	Enye nu yeye.
I am sure you know this for real.	Meka ɖe edzi be ènya esia ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There was no issue with this.	Nya aɖeke menɔ nya sia ŋu o.
A little less money, anyway	Ga si le ʋɛ vie, le mɔ sia mɔ nu
He never stood a chance.	Metsi tre ɖe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke nu gbeɖe o.
I will live with it for a while.	Manɔ agbe kplii ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
They shouldn’t have any major problems.	Mele be kuxi gã aɖeke nanɔ wo ŋu o.
I don’t know, but I’d love to know.	Nyemenya o, gake adzɔ dzi nam be manya.
I remember being impressed by a few things	Meɖo ŋku edzi be nu ʋɛ aɖewo wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye
But it really felt like a lie.	Gake ewɔ nam ŋutɔ be enye alakpa.
I'll explain what that is.	Maɖe nusi ema nye la me.
He didn’t ask that question.	Mebia nya ma o.
I would know what to expect	Anye ne manya nusi makpɔ mɔ na
Thank you so much in advance.	Akpe geɖe na mi do ŋgɔ.
I couldn’t stay here	Nyemete ŋu nɔ afisia o
A new day is coming	Ŋkeke yeye aɖe gbɔna
Once you do that, let me know.	Ne ènya wɔe nenema ko la, na manya.
There was no car.	Ʋu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I realized something about myself	Mekpɔ nane dze sii le ɖokuinye ŋu
I know exactly where he is.	Menya afisi tututu wòle.
I thought it was a good opportunity for me to do something new.	Mesusu be mɔnukpɔkpɔ nyui aɖee wònye nam be mawɔ nu yeye aɖe.
I wanted to see what they were doing	Medi be makpɔ nu si wɔm wole
There is nothing to protect anyone.	Naneke meli si akpɔ ame aɖeke ta o.
Everyone was talking about that.	Amesiame nɔ nu ma ƒom.
That has been clear for some time.	Ema me kɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
I couldn’t hear them	Nyemete ŋu se wo o
I don’t want to see you.	Nyemedi be makpɔ wò o.
Come here.	Va afisia.
Make an effort to do it.	Dze agbagba aɖee.
I am working hard on it.	Mele dɔ wɔm tso eŋu vevie.
But I did with that.	Gake mewɔe kple ema.
That’s just my little thing on it.	Nye nu sue aɖe koe nye ema le edzi.
And his death was devastating.	Eye eƒe ku gblẽ nu le ame ŋu ŋutɔ.
They have a lot of people	Ame geɖe le wo si
He didn’t know his real name.	Menya eƒe ŋkɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
That search didn’t last long.	Didi ma mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi o.
This is actually much smaller than it used to be.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia le sue ŋutɔ wu alesi wònɔ tsã.
However, time was important but in a different way.	Ke hã, ɣeyiɣi nɔ vevie gake le mɔ bubu nu.
I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t	Medi be maɖe ŋku ɖa, gake nyemete ŋui o
I used to enjoy my time alone	Tsã la, nye ɖeka koe kpɔa dzidzɔ ɖe nye ɣeyiɣi ŋu
I am the one behind it all	Nyee nye amesi le megbe na wo katã
I knew he was someone who would help me	Menya be enye ame aɖe si akpe ɖe ŋunye
Strongly strong.	Sesẽ sesẽ.
I haven’t seen you so happy in a long time	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia nyemekpɔ wò nèle dzidzɔ kpɔm alea o
Look at your back.	Lé ŋku ɖe wò megbe ŋu.
I am sure of that	Meka ɖe edzi le ema ŋu
Not very convenient.	Menye nusi sɔ ŋutɔ o.
She had no desire to go with him.	Didi aɖeke menɔ eme be yeayi kplii o.
Everyone is happy.	Amesiame kpɔa dzidzɔ.
I was able to pass them easily	Mete ŋu to wo ŋu bɔbɔe
That’s pretty clear.	Ema me kɔ nyuie.
I saw some of them with him	Mekpɔ wo dometɔ aɖewo kplii
I would probably lose my job	Anɔ eme be dɔ ge le asinye
The first person to try anything probably died at that point.	Anɔ eme be ame gbãtɔ si te nusianu kpɔ la ku le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
It would never have worked between us.	Anye ne mawɔ dɔ le mía dome gbeɖe o.
I will ride through this	Mado sɔ to esia me
I’m still going to do it.	Megale edzi kokoko.
Keep going, man.	Yi edzi, ame.
However, this is not easy to do.	Ke hã, esia wɔwɔ mele bɔbɔe o.
You never know where you are.	Mènya afi si nèle gbeɖe o.
Which makes a little sense.	Nusi me susu le vie.
I have a busy schedule.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo si me vovo mele o.
If only we had more time	Ne ɖe ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu nanɔ mía si
That’s a good idea	Susu nyui aɖee nye ema
I knew it would be.	Menya be anye nenema.
I miss you so much already	Mesusu wò ŋutɔ xoxo
At a higher cost, of course.	Le ga geɖe wu me ya.
This week will be better.	Kwasiɖa sia anyo wu.
But he is so much like you.	Gake ele abe wò ene ale gbegbe.
Only now can I speak to myself	Fifia koe mate ŋu aƒo nu na ɖokuinye
It started the whole thing.	Edze nu bliboa gɔme.
I suggest everyone else do the same	Meɖo aɖaŋu be ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã nawɔ nenema ke
I have never been able to call you	Nyemete ŋu ƒo ka na wò kpɔ o
You said maybe you could talk to him.	Ègblɔ be ɖewohĩ yeate ŋu aƒo nu kplii.
I knew he would find me eventually	Menya be ava ke ɖe ŋunye mlɔeba
He didn’t let go at all.	Meɖe asi le eŋu kura o.
I'm here now.	Meva afisia fifia.
I really like what he did with this	Nusi wòwɔ kple esia la dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
This worked well.	Esia wɔ dɔ nyuie.
I just know how they are	Ðeko menya alesi wole
I should have known you could have found it.	Ðe wòle be manya be àte ŋu ake ɖe eŋu hafi.
Maybe he doesn’t have one.	Ðewohĩ ɖeke mele esi o.
Hopefully you have a car.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be ʋu aɖe le asiwò.
Not more than once, anyway.	Menye wu zi ɖeka o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
A few of them are planning work	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo le ɖoɖo wɔm ɖe dɔ ŋu
I had never heard of it	Nyemese eŋu nya kpɔ o
I was shocked to hear that	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ esi mese nya ma
I know that they are.	Menya be wole nenema.
I was as surprised as anyone	Ewɔ nuku nam abe amesiame ene
Do it once and for all.	Wɔe zi ɖeka.
Not too obvious though.	Menye nusi dze ƒã akpa o ke hã.
And let me tell you something.	Eye na magblɔ nya aɖe na wò.
That sounds weird to me.	Ema ɖi nusi wɔ nuku nam.
It’s not because of what someone else did.	Menye nusi ame bubu aɖe wɔ tae o.
His neck, too.	Eƒe kɔ hã.
And with a new project.	Eye kple dɔ yeye aɖe.
Or maybe it didn’t.	Alo ɖewohĩ mewɔe nenema o.
I can never play these things right.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu siawo nyuie gbeɖe o.
He was some kind of person.	Enye ame aɖe si ƒomevi wònye.
I'll see who killed them	Makpɔ amesi wu wo
This is a good day.	Ŋkeke nyui aɖee nye esia.
I couldn’t concentrate on what he was asking	Nyemete ŋu tsɔ nye susu ɖo nusi biam wònɔ ŋu o
But no one said anything.	Gake ame aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
And for myself, too.	Eye na nye ŋutɔ hã.
That’s something else.	Nu bubu aɖee nye ema.
I only have four.	Ene koe le asinye.
I said there was no way.	Megblɔ be mɔ aɖeke meli o.
I was very excited	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ
But we must hurry.	Gake ele be míawɔ kaba.
We will do another project on it.	Míawɔ dɔ bubu aɖe tso eŋu.
The idea is almost surreal.	Susu la nye nusi me susu mele o kloe.
You can’t really do it.	Màte ŋu awɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Trust me, it’s not surprising.	Ka ɖe dzinye be mewɔ nuku o.
This sort of thing really makes sense to me.	Susu le nya sia ƒomevi ŋu nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We cannot help with this.	Míate ŋu akpe asi ɖe esia ŋu o.
You don’t have to do this.	Mehiã be nàwɔ esia o.
I was the only one left.	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
Expect it to be nothing.	Kpɔ mɔ be menye naneke o.
I’m not going to allow that	Nyemele mɔ ɖe ge nenema o
I recognized his voice	Mekpɔ eƒe gbe dze sii
I can’t stand that	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe nya ma dzi o
It will go here and there.	Ayi afisia kple afima.
There had been something in it.	Nane nɔ eme kpɔ.
It’s just a problem, or it is.	Kuxi koe wònye, alo wònye.
I came home to take care of him	Meva aƒeme be makpɔ edzi
You only have enough time.	Ɣeyiɣi si sɔ gbɔ koe le asiwò.
Look at this road.	Kpɔ mɔ sia dzi ɖa.
But now things have changed.	Gake fifia nuwo trɔ.
There is not much work to be done in this situation.	Dɔ geɖe meli woawɔ le nɔnɔme sia me o.
I had a lot of great moments	Mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi gã geɖe
Everyone was charming.	Amesiame ƒe nu lé dzi na ame.
I have a problem with that.	Kuxi aɖe le ŋunye le ema ŋu.
He can’t do anything.	Mate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
I don’t understand this cheap stuff.	Nyemese nu sia si mexɔ asi o gɔme o.
I don’t want to know this	Nyemedi be manya esia o
I don’t know this guy	Nyemenya ŋutsu sia o
From your side of the story.	Tso wò akpa dzi.
And just as quickly.	Eye kaba nenema ke.
It was a lot of fun for us.	Edzɔ dzi na mí ŋutɔ.
Take some money with you	Tsɔ ga aɖewo ɖe asi
I promise you in every way	Medo ŋugbe na wò le go sia go me
I'm better this time	Me nyo wu zi sia
I will do a good job on this project.	Mawɔ dɔ nyui aɖe le dɔ sia ŋu.
I really wanted to go	Medi vevie be mayi
And so many things that are important to us.	Eye nu geɖe ŋutɔ siwo le vevie na mí.
He certainly didn’t.	Mewɔe nenema o godoo.
I know what they want.	Menya nusi dim wole.
Almost every kind of device.	Mɔ̃ ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe kloe.
You have no life.	Agbe aɖeke mele asiwò o.
But I had to hurry	Gake ele be mawɔ kaba
Be there for us.	Nɔ afima na mí.
I really liked that about him	Ema dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ le eŋu
There were moments.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖewo nɔ anyi.
That’s the issue with you.	Emae nye nya si le ŋuwò.
I belong to a large house	Aƒe gã aɖe me tɔ menye
I felt like one of them	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe wo dometɔ ɖeka ene
Sort of, anyway.	Ƒomevi aɖe, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
The dog is pregnant.	Avu la fɔ fu.
Hard work, people.	Dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ, amewo.
I couldn’t understand it	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme o
He has very strong legs.	Afɔ sesẽ ŋutɔ le esi.
I wondered what was wrong with him.	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae le fu ɖem nɛ hã.
Nothing is a problem.	Naneke menye kuxi o.
I really hoped things would boil over pretty well	Mekpɔ mɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ be nuwo aƒo tsi nyuie ŋutɔ
I hope he will be there this morning	Mele mɔ kpɔm be anɔ afima ŋdi sia
It’s just not true.	Ðeko menye nyateƒe o.
Home came so late.	Aƒeme va tsi megbe nenema.
This surprised me a lot	Esia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
I saw what he did to her	Mekpɔ nu si wòwɔ ɖe eŋu
You have a voice for this.	Gbe le asiwò na esia.
These people can’t do that much about it.	Ame siawo mate ŋu awɔ nu geɖe ɖe eŋu nenema gbegbe o.
A new hit, never seen before	Nu yeye aɖe si xɔ ŋkɔ ŋutɔ, si mekpɔ kpɔ o
I'm sure of it.	Meka ɖe edzi.
It may not be the case.	Ðewohĩ manɔ nenema o.
He had an air about him.	Ya aɖe nɔ esi ku ɖe eŋu.
And of course, the night.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, zã la hã.
I was in a different place and in a different time	Menɔ teƒe bubu eye menɔ ɣeyiɣi bubu me
Stand up and have your say.	Tsi tre nàgblɔ wò susu.
He can travel often .	Ate ŋu azɔ mɔ zi geɖe .
I am smarter than you.	Medze aɖaŋu wu wò.
I need to talk to you	Ehiã be maƒo nu kpli wò
That’s not really true.	Ema menye nyateƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I told him once that was not a good idea	Megblɔ nɛ zi ɖeka be ema menye susu nyui aɖeke o
And it will be very very expensive.	Eye axɔ asi ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
I guess he’s not the only one	Mesusu be menye eya ɖeka koe o
I just needed something else, different	Ðeko mehiã nu bubu aɖe, si to vovo
What there will be, will be.	Nusi anɔ anyi, anye.
No one knows what’s going on.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi le edzi yim o.
The literature on this subject is extensive.	Agbalẽ siwo ƒo nu tso nya sia ŋu la sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
We used to grow up.	Míenya tsi tsã.
I wasn’t here to come home	Menye ɖe menɔ afisia be mava aƒeme o
I don’t know which one is better.	Nyemenya wo dometɔ si nyo wu o.
I couldn’t leave yet	Nyemete ŋu dzo haɖe o
It has never been able to work.	Mete ŋu le dɔ wɔm kpɔ o.
He wasn’t dressed properly.	Medo awu nyuie o.
One summer night.	Dzomeŋɔli ƒe zã aɖe.
That’s me, and that’s real	Nyee nye ema, eye esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ
I stood there for a moment wondering	Metsi tre ɖe afima vie nɔ ɖokuinye biam
Still, I really enjoyed it	Ke hã, edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
But it obviously is.	Gake edze ƒã be ele nenema.
At least so far.	Vaseɖe fifia ya teti.
A very happy situation	Nɔnɔme si me dzidzɔ le ŋutɔ
I couldn’t see them	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ wo o
It is not at all obvious that this is true.	Medze ƒã kura be esia nye nyateƒe o.
None of us got it right.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mese egɔme nyuie o.
I can just eat.	Ðeko mate ŋu aɖu nu.
This was pretty fast from there.	Esia nɔ du dzi ŋutɔ tso afima.
I wouldn’t be that surprised	Mawɔ nuku nam nenema o
It’s a very interesting thing.	Enye nusi dzɔa dzi na ame ŋutɔ.
He was satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme.
Every death is a small death for you.	Ku ɖesiaɖe nye ku sue aɖe na wò.
There wasn’t much there	Nu geɖe menɔ afima o
I can’t really talk right now	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu ŋutɔŋutɔ fifia o
Nothing strange about that.	Naneke mewɔ nuku le ema ŋu o.
I did the same thing.	Nye hã mewɔe nenema.
That's too good to be true.	Ema nyo akpa.
But my heart sank that day.	Gake nye dzi ku gbe ma gbe.
I needed to go home with someone	Ehiã be mayi aƒeme kple ame aɖe
I couldn’t wait for you.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ lalam na wò o.
That can be a problem.	Ema ate ŋu anye kuxi.
It may be that way.	Ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
Click, click, click.	Zi edzi, zi edzi, zi edzi.
Or lie to you.	Alo alakpa na wò.
I expect a lot of myself.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na nu geɖe tso ɖokuinye gbɔ.
I can’t say anything	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke o
I felt so much today	Mese le ɖokuinye me ale gbegbe egbea
If anything, it’s the opposite.	Ne nane li la, ke nusi to vovo na emae.
I decided to keep going.	Meɖoe be mayi edzi.
They are on and inside.	Wole edzi kple eme.
I was very worried, you know.	Metsi dzi vevie ŋutɔ, ènya.
If nothing else suits, he can go home.	Ne nu bubu aɖeke medze o la, ate ŋu ayi aƒeme.
I can’t tell you that	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma na mi o
I fell like a rock	Medze anyi abe kpe ene
He couldn't think of her name.	Mete ŋu bu eƒe ŋkɔ ŋu o.
I didn’t see anything	Nyemekpɔ naneke o
You know this summer has been a little tough.	Ènya be dzomeŋɔli sia sesẽ vie.
There is none of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
No one had ever done this to him.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ nu sia ɖe eŋu kpɔ o.
He’s interested in it.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme.
I couldn’t beat him	Nyemete ŋu ƒo ɖe eŋu o
Maybe that’s what they have in mind.	Ðewohĩ emae le susu me na wo.
I was talking.	Menɔ nu ƒom.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I blinked and stood on my own	Meɖe ŋku ɖe eŋu eye metsi tre le ɖokuinye si
Everything else here is really good.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe si le afisia nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
One thing is clear to me.	Nu ɖeka me kɔ nam.
I need you.	Mehiã wò.
There were some good reasons.	Susu nyui aɖewo nɔ eme.
This idea didn’t work.	Susu sia meɖe vi aɖeke o.
I have to focus on one thing at a time	Ele be nye susu nanɔ nu ɖeka ŋu le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me
Maybe something was going on behind the scenes.	Ðewohĩ nane nɔ edzi yim le megbe nɛ.
I’ve done it before.	Mewɔe kpɔ.
I know he is with us	Menya be ele mía gbɔ
I think that’s going well.	Mesusu be ema le edzi yim nyuie.
I never felt like I needed them	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be mehiã wo o
Otherwise, not so much.	Ne menye nenema o la, menye nenema gbegbe o.
You are a part of it.	Ènye eƒe akpa aɖe.
I know what works for me	Menya nusi wɔa dɔ nam
That’s what it really is.	Emae nye ema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I have only one problem with it	Kuxi ɖeka koe le ŋunye le eŋu
I didn’t hear anything	Nyemese naneke o
Tell me the good news.	Gblɔ nya nyui la nam.
I focus on his voice	Nye susu nɔa eƒe gbe ŋu
I want to tell you what really happened	Medi be magblɔ nu si dzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ na mi
I am with you for the same reason	Susu ma ke tae mele kpli mi
I can’t get them off me	Nyemate ŋu aɖe wo le dzinye o
It doesn’t need to be processed.	Mehiã be woawɔ dɔ tso eŋu o.
What was in it was here.	Nusi nɔ eme la nɔ afisia.
I knew he would find me as soon as possible	Menya be ake ɖe ŋunye kaba ale si wòate ŋui
I didn’t know you were here	Nyemenya be èle afisia o
I just couldn’t face you	Ðeko nyemete ŋu dze ŋgɔ wò o
Maybe it’s not going anywhere.	Ðewohĩ mele afi aɖeke yim o.
There is no other way.	Mɔ bubu aɖeke meli o.
Times he didn’t have.	Ɣeyiɣi siwo menɔ esi o.
Look around the room once more.	Kpɔ xɔa me godoo zi ɖeka ake.
It’s not going to ruin your whole life.	Menye wò agbe bliboa gblẽ ge o.
It’s not a matter of fact.	Menye nya aɖeke o.
Nothing came of this .	Naneke medo tso esia me o .
You have a gun.	Tu le asiwò.
I don’t know how he disappeared	Nyemenya alesi wòwɔ bu o
Useful.	Ɖe vi.
I know everything you have to say	Menya nya sia nya si wòle be nàgblɔ
The opposite is not true	Nusi to vovo na ema menye nyateƒe o
I felt like he was seeing into my head	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ɖe wòle nu kpɔm le nye ta me ene
I wonder if anyone can help me	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye hã
It is quite a place.	Enye teƒe aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can’t seem to do it.	Edze abe nyemate ŋui o ene.
I will definitely do it for you	Mawɔe na wò godoo
We are just like that.	Ðeko míele nenema.
Not that it didn’t matter that much to him	Menye ɖe menɔ vevie nɛ nenema gbegbe o
Which is far from it.	Nusi gbɔ didi tso esia gbɔ.
The car didn’t respond.	Ʋua meɖo eŋu o.
I think morning.	Mesusu be ŋdi.
And, and, and.	Ne, ne, ne.
An idea came to me as he spoke	Susu aɖe va susu me nam esime wònɔ nu ƒom
Not sure where to look for this.	Nyemeka ɖe afi si madi esia le dzi o.
That is still true today.	Nya ma gakpɔtɔ nye nyateƒe egbea.
Tell them what you want.	Gblɔ nu si nèdi la na wo.
They have a good way going.	Mɔ nyui aɖe le wo si le edzi yim.
I had almost no time now	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ asinye kloe fifia o
I think he is doing better	Mesusu be ele edzi dzem nyuie wu
It will work well.	Awɔ dɔ nyuie.
They had two children	Vi eve nɔ wo si
I have something for you	Nane le asinye na wò
Everything.	Nu sia nu.
Nothing will, of course.	Naneke mawɔe o ya.
It can happen to anyone.	Ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe ame sia ame dzi.
Again, it doesn’t seem to.	Le afisia hã la, edze abe mewɔe nenema o ene.
But he never did that.	Gake mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
I think it’s been a while.	Mesusu be ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
This could have happened.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ hafi.
I took everything that came my way	Mexɔ nusianu si va dzinye
Which he doesn’t understand.	Nusi gɔme mese o.
But listen now.	Gake ɖo to fifia.
There must be another way.	Ele be mɔ bubu aɖe nanɔ anyi.
I said a quick little prayer	Medo gbe ɖa vie kaba
It wasn’t anything at all.	Menye naneke kura o.
Be what happened.	Nye nusi dzɔ.
I wonder how you found out about it.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke nèwɔ va nya nu tso eŋu hã.
But it was a great year.	Gake ƒe gã aɖee wònye.
This should be done soon.	Ele be woawɔ esia kpuie.
I can’t always get my way.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nye mɔ ɣesiaɣi o.
I thought it was someone	Mesusu be ame aɖee
I haven’t been able to write yet	Nyemete ŋu ŋlɔ nu haɖe o
I was worried about it	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu
No word on whether it’s any good or not.	Nya aɖeke meli ku ɖe nenye be enye nyui aɖeke alo menye nenema o ŋu o.
But that didn’t last long.	Gake ema menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
But it’s not something he can do for a job.	Gake menye nane si wòate ŋu awɔ na dɔ aɖe o.
I walked out of the room	Medo go le xɔa me
I am at the lake.	Mele ta la gbɔ.
Which is a bit surprising.	Nusi wɔ nuku vie.
If it doesn’t work out, it doesn’t matter.	Ne medze edzi o la, ke mehiã o.
Who knows if anything will come of it.	Amekae nya ne nane ado tso eme.
I want to share that with you	Medi be magblɔ nya ma na mi
I had an early night	Zã aɖe nɔ asinye kaba
It must have been amazing.	Anɔ eme be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Now he was very tired.	Fifia ɖeɖi te eŋu ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t step on them.	Nyemete ŋu tu afɔ wo dzi o.
Not enough, please. 	Ga koe taflatse. 
But it’s a big part.	Gake enye akpa gã aɖe.
I have a name, you know	Ŋkɔ le asinye, ènya
About everything.	Le nusianu ŋu.
Not from here.	Menye tso afisia o.
It is very real.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s why you’re here.	Esia tae nèle afisia ɖo.
This in itself isn’t really a big deal.	Esia le eɖokui si menye nu gã aɖeke ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I think it could work	Mesusu be ate ŋu awɔ dɔ
I give you one of them now.	Metsɔ wo dometɔ ɖeka na wò fifia.
I would be so out of place here	Manɔ teƒe bubu ale gbegbe le afisia
A very, very big deal.	Nya gã aɖe ŋutɔ aɖe ŋutɔ.
He had felt that way himself, not so long ago.	Eya ŋutɔ hã se le eɖokui me nenema kpɔ, menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia o.
Put it in the hole.	Do me ɖe eme.
I want what you have	Medi nusi le asiwò
I couldn’t let go of it	Nyemete ŋu ɖe asi le eŋu o
It will probably be my last	Anɔ eme be anye nye mamlɛtɔ
This is not a big deal.	Esia menye nya gã aɖeke o.
I couldn’t give you more	Nyemete ŋu na nu geɖe wu wò o
I got a job.	Mekpɔ dɔ aɖe.
This is a mistake.	Esia nye vodada.
Nothing is old here.	Naneke metsi le afisia o.
I just know myself too well	Ðeko menya ɖokuinye nyuie akpa
I completely missed this point.	Nya sia to ŋunye kura.
It’s just the truth.	Nyateƒea koe wònye.
I took the time to talk to myself	Mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi ƒo nu na ɖokuinye
I really don’t know about that.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nu tso ema ŋu o.
I hope that doesn’t bother you too much	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ema maɖe fu na wò akpa o
That’s another problem.	Ema nye kuxi bubu aɖe.
I understand everything now.	Mese nusianu gɔme fifia.
Everything became easier.	Nusianu va nɔ bɔbɔe.
That’s a pretty simple thing.	Ema nye nu bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔ.
I must have thrown them away.	Anɔ eme be metsɔ wo ƒu gbe.
On the other hand, it might not.	Le go bubu me la, ɖewohĩ mawɔe nenema o.
What's the worst.	Nukae gblẽ wu.
I think I kind of liked him	Mesusu be eƒe nu lé dzi nam le mɔ aɖe nu
I can get away with anything	Mate ŋu asi le nusianu nu
He needed a job.	Ehiã dɔ aɖe.
He was such a nice person.	Ame nyui aɖee wònye nenema gbegbe.
Good nutrition is any food.	Nuɖuɖu nyui nye nuɖuɖu ɖesiaɖe.
You can explain that.	Àte ŋu aɖe nya ma me.
He can feel like he has four eyes.	Ate ŋu ase le eɖokui me be ŋku ene le ye ŋu.
I’ve never seen this side of it	Nyemekpɔ eƒe akpa sia kpɔ o
I got along well with him	Mewɔ ɖeka kplii nyuie
You’ll be thrilled.	Adzɔ dzi na wò.
And there’s another one behind that.	Eye bubu aɖe hã le megbe na ema.
I thought he would never speak to me	Mesusu be maƒo nu nam gbeɖe o
I’m committed to you.	Metsɔ ɖokuinye na wò.
I thought someone like you could help me	Mesusu be ame aɖe si le abe wò ene ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye
People who treat each other well.	Ame siwo wɔa nu ɖe ​​wo nɔewo ŋu nyuie.
I’ve never felt that way before.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o.
I think my time here is up	Mesusu be nye ɣeyiɣi le afisia wu enu
There’s a lot to like here.	Nu geɖe siwo adzɔ dzi na wò le afisia.
That doesn’t matter.	Ema mehiã o.
Which is not the case.	Nusi menye nenema o.
This will never work.	Esia mawɔ dɔ gbeɖe o.
Nothing could be further from the truth	Naneke mate ŋu anɔ ŋgɔ wu nyateƒea o
None of them are true.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
I heard this could be true.	Mese be esia ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
You might be surprised.	Ðewohĩ awɔ nuku na wò.
That day was like the last.	Ŋkeke ma nɔ abe ŋkeke mamlɛtɔ ene.
I am really starting them	Mele wo gɔme dzem ŋutɔŋutɔ
This book has meant a lot to me.	Agbalẽ sia fia nu geɖe nam.
And it can be that way.	Eye ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
Why would anyone want to	Nukatae ame aɖe adi be .
But think about this carefully.	Gake bu nya sia ŋu nyuie.
How do you get on board.	Aleke nàwɔ aɖo ʋua me.
I definitely have some work to do in this area.	Dɔ aɖewo le asinye mawɔ le go sia me godoo.
I didn’t see them, but they’re there	Nyemekpɔ wo o, gake wole afima
But we did have one small problem.	Gake kuxi sue ɖeka aɖe nɔ mía ŋu ya.
I want to address that	Medi be makpɔ ema gbɔ
But pretty much everyone else was there.	Gake ame bubu ɖesiaɖe kloe nɔ afima.
A very different situation.	Nɔnɔme si to vovo kura.
Tell me something, just between you and me.	Gblɔ nya aɖe nam, le mía kpli wò dome ko.
Clearly, something is wrong.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ.
I can’t let go of it	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu o
I know you have a lot to deal with	Menya be nu geɖe le asiwò nàwɔ nu kplii
He couldn’t have done anything else.	Mate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke hafi o.
I wanted to do something new	Medi be mawɔ nu yeye aɖe
I'm not ready.	Nyemele klalo o.
Two for two people.	Eve ɖe ame eve ta.
I can’t let go of it	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu o
He didn't seem to mind.	Ewɔ abe ɖe meɖe fu nɛ o ene.
A new era is about to begin	Ɣeyiɣi yeye aɖe le egɔme dze ge
He wouldn't talk about what was going on.	Maƒo nu tso nusi nɔ edzi yim ŋu o.
About us, man.	Ku ɖe mía ŋu, ame.
There are two difficulties with this situation.	Nu sesẽ eve le nɔnɔme sia ŋu.
I created every child	Nyee wɔ ɖevi ɖesiaɖe
It could end up going anywhere these days.	Ate ŋu ava yi afi sia afi le ŋkeke siawo me.
He had my back.	Nye megbe nɔ eŋu.
Your blood, someone said.	Wò ʋu, ame aɖe gblɔ.
Wish he was here too	Ne ɖe eya hã nɔ afisia la, anye ne edzɔ dzi na wò
I have some food for you.	Nuɖuɖu aɖewo le asinye na wò.
He couldn't turn back now.	Mete ŋu trɔ ɖe megbe fifia o.
He never stayed with anyone for too long.	Menɔ ame aɖeke gbɔ ɣeyiɣi didi akpa gbeɖe o.
I think he would like it better	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi nɛ wu
Obviously, you can leave the house without anything else.	Edze ƒã be àte ŋu ado le aƒea me nu bubu aɖeke manɔmee.
Many people end up like that	Ame geɖe wu enu nenema
He never asked for anything.	Mebia naneke kpɔ o.
I want to see you	Medi be makpɔ wo
I couldn’t do anything	Nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke o
Not that anything happened.	Menye be naneke dzɔ o.
I will live with it.	Manɔ agbe kplii.
I didn’t know what was bothering him	Nyemenya nusi nɔ fu ɖem nɛ o
I struggle with it.	Mewɔa avu kplii.
He will be pleased.	Adzɔ dzi nɛ.
In the house.	Le aƒea me.
I can’t stay here anymore	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afisia azɔ o
She doesn’t know a man, she won’t meet him.	Menya ŋutsu aɖeke o, mado go o.
I want to know what happened there	Medi be manya nusi dzɔ le afima
Do that now.	Wɔe nenema fifia.
That you’re in your home isn’t personal.	Be èle wò aƒeme la menye ame ŋutɔ tɔ o.
But not much.	Gake menye nu geɖe o.
All these things.	Nu siawo katã.
There are books that will finish next year.	Agbalẽ aɖewo li siwo awu enu le ƒe si gbɔna me.
There was never an issue.	Nya aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
You can stay here.	Àte ŋu anɔ afisia.
It will continue to exist.	Ayi edzi anɔ anyi.
It has never been like that.	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o.
But there’s nothing extravagant about it.	Gake naneke meli si gbɔ eme le eŋu o.
I just know the one too.	Nye hã menya ɖeka la ko.
Doing what you want.	Nusi nèdi wɔwɔ.
I don’t know what to do with it.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ kplii o.
I just knew it was true	Ðeko menya be enye nyateƒe
I distinctly remember a snake, more than one	Meɖo ŋku da aɖe dzi nyuie, wu ɖeka
Where you live doesn’t really matter.	Afi si nèle la mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I can’t imagine anything bad happening tonight	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke le susu me si adzɔ le zã sia me o
I was expecting this	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na esia
I stood back and was very pleased with my work	Metsi tre ɖe megbe eye nye dɔa dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
But that’s nothing.	Gake ema menye naneke o.
He is a real person.	Enye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I had time to do a lot of work.	Mekpɔ vovo ɖe dɔ geɖe wɔwɔ ŋu.
I wish he was here too	Ne ɖe eya hã nɔ afisia la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
I see how you are with him	Mekpɔ ale si nèle kplii
I’m the only one who does this.	Nye ɖeka koe wɔa esia.
If anything, it’s the opposite.	Ne nane li la, ke nusi to vovo na emae.
So is he, too.	Eya hã le nenema.
I felt really at home there and very comfortable	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mele aƒeme ŋutɔŋutɔ le afima eye nye dzi dze eme ŋutɔ
And apparently this guy is no exception.	Eye edze abe ŋutsu sia hã mele eme o ene.
Not really doing anything.	Menye naneke wɔwɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Maybe I’ll do it.	Ðewohĩ mawɔe.
Take a hard look at them.	Lé ŋku ɖe wo ŋu sesĩe.
I want to make the same apology	Medi be maɖe kuku ma ke
I think that’s probably fair	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ema sɔ
And yet, and yet.	Eye ke hã, eye ke hã.
He might have a problem.	Ðewohĩ kuxi aɖe nanɔ eŋu.
I am looking forward to it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie.
He should try each one, maybe.	Ele be wòate wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe kpɔ, ɖewohĩ.
It would be great if someone could help.	Anyo ŋutɔ ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu.
It is really important.	Ele vevie nyateƒe.
I wonder what’s on his mind right now	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae le eƒe susu me fifia hã
Let me handle this.	Mina makpɔ esia gbɔ.
I understand why they are here	Mese nusita wole afisia gɔme
But two points are very important here.	Gake nya eve le vevie ŋutɔ le afisia.
I need to do more.	Ele be mawɔ geɖe wu.
I look forward to all of them very much	Mele mɔ kpɔm na wo katã ŋutɔ
Now, he couldn’t do that.	Fifia, mete ŋu wɔ ema o.
It seemed a bit small.	Edze abe ɖe wòle sue vie ene.
I hardly knew what to tell him	Nyemenya nusi magblɔ nɛ kura o
He stroked her hand.	Etsɔ asi ƒo eƒe asi ŋu.
The dog was in good condition.	Avu la nɔ nɔnɔme nyui me.
I am as curious as you are.	Nye hã medi be manya nu abe wò ke ene.
But what one can do.	Gake nusi ame ate ŋu awɔ.
Who has access to all of us.	Amekae kpɔ mɔ akpɔ mí katã.
Everything fit perfectly.	Nusianu sɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
Nothing in a year.	Naneke meli le ƒe ɖeka me o.
Do it better.	Wɔe nyuie wu.
I do this without thinking	Mewɔa esia ŋu bubu manɔmee
A man came, with two children	Ŋutsu aɖe va, eye ɖevi eve nɔ eŋu
Which is what he wanted.	Nusi nye nusi dim wònɔ.
And you can’t say that often enough.	Eye màte ŋu agblɔ nya ma zi geɖe o.
A very interesting point	Nya aɖe si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ
That’s actually pretty good.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
There was something in it.	Nane nɔ eme.
I have a very different life now	Agbe si to vovo kura le asinye fifia
I glared at him angrily	Metsɔ dziku ƒo ŋku ɖe eŋu
I just wanted to talk to you about before	Ðeko medi be maƒo nu na wò tso do ŋgɔ ŋu
He will always be with us	Anɔ mía gbɔ ɣesiaɣi
I am a private person.	Nyee nye ame si nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
I don’t know where they are	Nyemenya afisi wole o
I would love to see you	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be makpɔ wò
I knew exactly what he would do	Menya nu si tututu wòawɔ
No one ever cared.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme kpɔ o.
We have nothing now.	Naneke mele mía si fifia o.
Probably not much.	Ðewohĩ menye nu geɖe o.
Imagine a big ship.	Kpɔ meli gã aɖe ɖa le susu me.
He didn’t allow it.	Meɖe mɔ ɖe eŋu o.
He doesn’t care now.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme fifia o.
I was always in the house	Menɔ aƒea me ɣesiaɣi
There will be a breeze soon.	Ya aɖe aƒo kpuie.
And that’s right, too.	Eye esia hã sɔ.
I so say remember	Me ale be magblɔ be ɖo ŋku edzi
I want to go home now	Medi be mayi aƒe fifia
I also need to be doing my job	Ele be manɔ nye dɔa wɔm hã
He had a job to do.	Dɔ nɔ esi wòawɔ.
I don’t know how to talk to this guy.	Nyemenya alesi maƒo nu kple ŋutsu sia o.
I didn’t want to upset him.	Nyemedi be mado dziku nɛ o.
I need some eyes and ears there	Mehiã ŋku kple to aɖewo le afima
You are not the first person to do this.	Menye wòe nye ame gbãtɔ si wɔ esia o.
It never was and never will be	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o eye manɔ nenema hã o
His face had changed.	Eƒe mo trɔ kpɔ.
In a sense, this is true.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, esia nye nyateƒe.
You know about this plan.	Ènya nu tso ɖoɖo sia ŋu.
I don’t see how it could be	Nyemekpɔ alesi wòate ŋu anɔ o
I don’t think that’s good.	Nyemesusu be esia nyo o.
I couldn’t remember his name	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi o
That means something.	Ema fia nane.
I can’t take the room anymore	Nyemate ŋu axɔ xɔa me azɔ o
And what isn’t that.	Eye nukae menye nenema o.
I couldn’t figure out exactly what it was	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi tututu wònye la ŋu o
In a way, this is not a real job.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, esia menye dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Who knows if that’s possible.	Amekae nya nenye be ema anya wɔ.
I want to be the same	Medi be manɔ nenema ke
Everyone else knows them.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe nya wo.
I had to get out of there	Ele be mado le afima
It didn’t take long	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o
I felt my face turn red.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye mo trɔ dzo.
I think everyone should have something like this	Mesusu be ele be nane si le abe esia ene nanɔ amesiame si
I have never seen or heard of death	Nyemekpɔ ku alo mese ku kpɔ o
And he could barely walk in the afternoon.	Eye ƒã hafi wòate ŋu azɔ le ŋdɔ me.
And it worked, finally.	Eye ewɔ dɔ, mlɔeba.
I was hoping it would come at all	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be ava kura
Your whole plan, complete.	Wò ɖoɖo bliboa, wu enu.
That much is clear.	Nu geɖe ma me kɔ ƒã.
I can’t imagine what would have happened if everyone knew	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi adzɔ ne ɖe amesiame nya la le susu me o
Please speak reasonably.	Taflatse ƒo nu kple susu nyuie.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
This is not difficult at all.	Esia menye nu sesẽ aɖeke kura o.
Please stay that way.	Taflatse nɔ nenema.
I was speaking from my heart	Menɔ nu ƒom tso nye dzi me
I thought, today would be a good day	Mesusu be, egbea anye ŋkeke nyui aɖe
I know that sounds weird	Menya be nya ma ɖi nusi wɔ nuku na amewo
I couldn’t speak either	Nye hã nyemete ŋu ƒo nu o
That’s a very, very strange idea.	Ema nye susu aɖe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
And at this point, he didn’t care.	Eye le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
I can’t hear about that	Nyemate ŋu ase nu tso nya ma ŋu o
I did trust him, and I hoped for more.	Meka ɖe edzi nyateƒe, eye mekpɔ mɔ na nu geɖe wu.
I never felt the need to be around so many people	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be ehiã be manɔ ame geɖe gbɔ o
Maybe you’re here because of that.	Ðewohĩ èle afisia le ema ta.
There are many places we can go.	Teƒe geɖe li siwo míate ŋu ayi.
I plan to make her some more clothes, soon.	Meɖoe be mawɔ awu bubu aɖewo nɛ, kpuie.
I can’t remember his name.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi o.

I hope you enjoy it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò.
I might come out and see you soon	Ðewohĩ mado go ava kpɔ wò kpuie
The opposite is not acceptable.	Nusi to vovo na esia la medze o.
More is better, to some extent.	Nu geɖe nyo wu, vaseɖe afi aɖe.
I did something else	Mewɔ nu bubu aɖe
I want something done about that	Medi be woawɔ nane tso ema ŋu
That was a killer word	Nya ma nye nya si wu ame

Nothing at all strange there.	Naneke kura mewɔ nuku le afima o.
We have two issues.	Nya eve le mía si.
And a great dog, too.	Eye avu gã aɖe hã.
Otherwise, it doesn’t exist.	Ne menye nenema o la, meli o.
He can’t be a kid because of you.	Mate ŋu anye ɖevi le wò ta o.
But he usually doesn’t do it at night.	Gake zi geɖe la, mewɔa esia le zã me o.
About two hours.	Anɔ abe gaƒoƒo eve ene.

Still, it would have been nice.	Ke hã, anye ne anyo ŋutɔ.
There is no reason for this.	Susu aɖeke meli si tae wòle alea ɖo o.
Discover his tongue.	Ke ɖe eƒe aɖe ŋu.
We know they are here.	Míenya be wole afisia.
People do things to people.	Amewo wɔa nuwo amewo.
I think they had an issue with that	Mesusu be nya aɖe nɔ wo ŋu le nya ma ŋu
I had no one else to call	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ asinye maƒo ka na o
I was trying to do my job	Menɔ agbagba dzem be mawɔ nye dɔ
One corpse was missing a leg	Ame kuku ɖeka ƒe afɔ aɖe bu
That’s what saved him.	Emae nye nusi xɔ nɛ.
Everyone is involved.	Amesiame hã le eme.
I approached some of these people.	Mete ɖe ame siawo dometɔ aɖewo ŋu.
These hands.	Asi siawo.
I needed something clever	Mehiã nane si me aɖaŋu le
I would definitely do some things differently today	Mawɔ nu aɖewo le mɔ bubu nu egbea godoo
I just really want you	Ðeko medi wò ŋutɔŋutɔ
I was closer to them this time	Mete ɖe wo ŋu wu zi sia
It could just be me.	Ate ŋu anye nye ɖeka ko.
I only heard about them yesterday, believe me	Etsɔ koe mese nu tso wo ŋu, xɔ dzinye se
The thing fit my hand perfectly.	Nu la sɔ nyuie na nye asi.
I can’t seem to get enough!.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ o ene!.
I promise you everything will be fine	Medo ŋugbe na wò be nusianu anyo
Is.	Enye.
I told you there was something in my past	Megblɔ na mi be nane nɔ nye agbe si va yi me
. . . .	.
Nothing is true.	Naneke menye nyateƒe o.
I was giving him just a little bit of his food	Menɔ eƒe nuɖuɖu sue aɖe ko nam nɛ
I was just worried about it	Ðeko metsi dzi ɖe eŋu
No one knows where he is.	Ame aɖeke menya afi si wòle o.
There’s no reason you can’t join them.	Susu aɖeke meli si ta màte ŋu awɔ ɖeka kpli wo o.
The age of your car will be great.	Ƒe si wò ʋua xɔ la anye gã aɖe.
I want to talk to you about a few things	Medi be maƒo nu tso nu ʋɛ aɖewo ŋu na wò
You can stay there, stay there.	Àte ŋu anɔ afima, anɔ afima.
It’s a huge challenge.	Enye kuxi gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I know exactly what you want	Menya nu si tututu nèdi
He certainly kept his word.	Ewɔ ɖe eƒe nya dzi godoo.
They are all wonderful.	Wo katã wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I could hear the anger in his voice	Mete ŋu se dziku si nɔ eƒe gbe me
I don’t have that.	Ema mele asinye o.
You can see them, but you cannot understand them.	Àte ŋu akpɔ wo, gake màte ŋu ase wo gɔme o.
Everyone needs it.	Amesiame hiã.
Maybe we’ll work with him soon.	Ðewohĩ míawɔ dɔ kplii kpuie.
What he did to me.	Nusi wòwɔ nam.
That’s one of the reasons.	Emae nye susu siwo tae la dometɔ ɖeka.
This last part surprised me.	Akpa mamlɛtɔ sia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
A real person this time	Ame ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖee zi sia
The process takes one to two hours.	Dɔa wɔwɔ xɔa gaƒoƒo ɖeka va ɖo eve.
Now I have them.	Fifia wole asinye.
It's not like he was doing anything here, anyway.	Menye abe ɖe wònɔ naneke wɔm le afisia ene o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I couldn’t control the dog at all.	Nyemete ŋu ɖu avu la dzi kura o.
I can’t answer him	Nyemate ŋu aɖo eŋu nɛ o
I want you in my heart	Medi wò le nye dzi me
I always plan for it	Mewɔa ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu ɣesiaɣi
I was relaxed.	Meɖe dzi ɖi.
But we have a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖe le mía ŋu.
He was only one child.	Vi ɖeka koe wònye.
But this doesn’t matter.	Gake esia mele vevie o.
In your heart you know it’s true.	Le wò dzi me la, ènya be enye nyateƒe.
Really short.	Kpuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I am going through death	Mele ku me tom
I told him everything	Megblɔ nya sia nya nɛ
You know that it is.	Ènya be ele nenema.
I will talk for hours	Maƒo nu gaƒoƒo geɖe
I have said this before	Megblɔ nya sia do ŋgɔ
He told them no more than he could properly help.	Megblɔ nya geɖe na wo wu alesi wòate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu nyuie o.
That was his plan.	Emae nye eƒe ɖoɖo.
However, we can’t.	Ke hã, míate ŋui o.
I will do what is right	Mawɔ nu si le eteƒe
I’m not going anywhere	Nyemele afi aɖeke yim o
I came with a lot of problems	Meva kple kuxi geɖe
What happened was simple.	Nusi dzɔ la nɔ bɔbɔe.
I have a better idea	Susu si nyo wu le asinye
Maybe just a few of them.	Ðewohĩ wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe.
I couldn’t go home.	Nyemete ŋu yi aƒeme o.
But they may have a tough road ahead.	Gake ɖewohĩ mɔ sesẽ aɖe le wo ŋgɔ.
I have never been able to.	Nyemete ŋui kpɔ o.
But overcome it.	Gake ɖu edzi.
A man is only as good as his word.	Ame aɖe nyo abe eƒe nya ene ko.
This is the opposite of what actually works.	Esia to vovo na nusi wɔa dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
A book is a new thing	Agbalẽ nye nu yeye aɖe
I know he is there for me	Menya be ele afima nam
It is no longer working.	Megale dɔ wɔm azɔ o.
Tomorrow it’s impossible.	Etsɔ la, manya wɔ o.
The same thing happened as before.	Nu ma ke dzɔ abe tsã ene.
I'm not okay with that though	Nyemele nyuie le ema ŋu gake
It was a lot of fun to work with.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
That’s a good enough idea for me.	Ema nye susu nyui aɖe si sɔ nam.
He looked immature.	Edze abe ɖe metsi o ene.
This is not a new phenomenon.	Esia menye nu yeye o.
He had a good heart.	Dzi nyui nɔ esi.
There was no mistake.	Vodada aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I was tired of searching	Didi te ɖeɖi ŋunye
He couldn’t be sure.	Mete ŋu ka ɖe edzi o.
I'm just trying to protect myself.	Ðeko mele agbagba dzem be makpɔ ɖokuinye ta.
I should not speak against you	Mele be maƒo nu ɖe ​​ŋuwò o
I can handle my newly appointed job.	Mate ŋu akpɔ nye dɔ yeye si meɖo la gbɔ.
I work very hard.	Mewɔa dɔ sesĩe ŋutɔ.
He didn't hear anything.	Mese naneke o.
There was no wind at all.	Ya aɖeke menɔ anyi kura o.
He never received another.	Mexɔ bubu aɖeke kpɔ o.
I need to talk to you now	Ehiã be maƒo nu kpli wò fifia
Now that that’s over, let me tell you how things are here.	Fifia si ema wu enu la, na magblɔ alesi nuwo le le afisia na wò.
But it wasn’t me.	Gake menye nyee o.
And it is so.	Eye ele nenema.
That’s just everything.	Nusianu koe nye ema.
When they talk to you, answer.	Ne wole nu ƒom na wò la, ɖo eŋu.
Take care.	Lé be nɛ.
That’s very interesting.	Ema doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
There was much work to be done.	Dɔ geɖe nɔ anyi be woawɔ.
I hope it will be useful	Mele mɔ kpɔm be aɖe vi na amewo
But you didn’t like him.	Gake eƒe nu lé dzi na wò medze ŋuwò o.
I quickly let go of him	Meɖe asi le eŋu kaba
This trend is expected to continue for the next several days.	Wole mɔ kpɔm be nɔnɔme sia ayi edzi le ŋkeke geɖe siwo gbɔna me.
There are two reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo tae wòle alea ɖo.
That might work.	Ema ate ŋu awɔ dɔ.
I had no idea anything was going on	Nyemenya kura be naneke le edzi yim o
I had to find out who I was	Ele be madi amesi nye
And it’s not an easy thing either.	Eye menye nu bɔbɔe aɖeke hã o.
I didn’t know there were more kids	Nyemenya be ɖevi geɖe wu va li o
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I know it’s not such an easy task	Menya be menye dɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o
I quickly remembered who he was	Meɖo ŋku amesi wònye dzi kaba
I became too independent	Meva nɔ ɖokuinye si akpa
I just wanted to be alone	Ðeko medi be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi
The case ended well.	Nya la va wu enu nyuie.
Now this is really bad.	Fifia esia gblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I thought it would help me	Mesusu be akpe ɖe ŋunye
For clear error.	Le vodada si me kɔ ta.
It probably started.	Anɔ eme be edze egɔme.
He didn’t have anyone.	Ame aɖeke menɔ esi o.
But it could be that way.	Gake ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
But money is much harder than bone.	Gake ga sesẽ wu ƒu ŋutɔ.
I think there could be some big moments tonight	Mesusu be ɣeyiɣi gã aɖewo ate ŋu anɔ anyi le zã sia me
Think about it carefully.	Bu eŋu nyuie.
Do it anyway.	Wɔe le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I had come to his senses weeks earlier	Meva ɖo eƒe susu me kwasiɖa aɖewo do ŋgɔ
Go to his house.	Yi eƒe aƒeme.
I knew it would come	Menya be ava
Few people do that.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔa nu ma.
I will be in the background.	Manɔ megbe.
And it will take a long time to get there.	Eye axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi hafi aɖo afima.
I’ve never felt that way before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o
But I can’t be mad at him	Gake nyemate ŋu ado dziku ɖe eŋu o
This is just not working.	Ðeko esia mele dɔ wɔm o.
And and and and and rock.	Eye kple kple kple kple kpe.
I think that much is obvious	Mesusu be nu geɖe ma dze ƒã
Look for it.	Di eme.
No wonder, there.	Mewɔ nuku o, le afima.
What we are.	Nusi míenye.
I enjoyed being alone in school.	Enye dzidzɔ nam be nye ɖeka koe nɔ suku.
There is no money.	Ga aɖeke meli o.
Again, he had never seen these clothes before.	Le afisia hã la, mekpɔ awu siawo kpɔ o.
That was hard for me.	Ema sesẽ nam.
Probably just as well	Ðewohĩ nenema ke wòle nyuie
I felt that way.	Mese le ɖokuinye me nenema.
I wondered which one shot me	Mebia ɖokuinye be wo dometɔ kae da tu nye hã
Thank you, thank you for any help.	Akpe na mi, akpe na mi ɖe kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe ta.
A water splashed inside	Tsi aɖe ƒo ɖe eme
But there was another reason.	Gake susu bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
A lot of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
I don’t want to do it	Nyemedi be mawɔe o
I just worked.	Ðeko mewɔ dɔ.
I really liked the idea.	Susu la dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I have never been so happy	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ nenema gbegbe kpɔ o
I know that language and it’s not a good word	Menya gbe ma eye menye nya nyuie wònye o
I’m on the same side as you	Nye hã mele akpa ɖeka me kple wò
I know what you did to him	Menya nu si nèwɔ ɖe eŋu
This will always be the case.	Esia anɔ alea ɣesiaɣi.
I heard from the police there	Mese nya tso kpovitɔwo gbɔ le afima
Many things can happen.	Nu geɖe ate ŋu adzɔ.
I wanted to do something different	Medi be mawɔ nane si to vovo
Maybe something a little simpler is better.	Ðewohĩ nane si le bɔbɔe vie la nyo wu.
I withdrew from everyone	Meɖe ɖokuinye ɖa le amesiame ŋu
I have never felt this way before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me alea kpɔ o
Not that he could remember.	Menye ɖe wòate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi o.
A place that never existed.	Teƒe si menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
I did as you wished	Mewɔ abe ale si nèdi ene
We can’t go on like this.	Míate ŋu ayi edzi alea o.
Work.	Dɔ.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
A very real person.	Ame ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe ŋutɔ.
I don’t have any more time now.	Ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖeke megale asinye fifia o.
Greet him with a smile.	Do gbe nɛ.
He was a good guy.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe.
I can tell you who you are	Mate ŋu agblɔ ame si nènye la na wò
I, of course, took a little longer	Nye ya, mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi vie ya
I don’t have much room left	Xɔ geɖe megale asinye o
I thought he was a good match	Mesusu be enye ame nyui aɖe si sɔ kplii
We know that much.	Míenya nu ma gbegbe.
I like the fresh air	Ya nyui si le afima la dzɔa dzi nam
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I will work on this.	Mawɔ dɔ tso esia ŋu.
If it were easy, everyone would do it.	Ne ele bɔbɔe la, anye ne amesiame awɔe.
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
I have to work and eat	Ele be mawɔ dɔ aɖu nu
I have everything.	Nusianu le asinye.
I wondered if that was true	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe nya ma nye nyateƒe hã
It’s not surprising.	Mewɔ nuku o.
Just that it was a man.	Ðeko be ŋutsu aɖee.
I decided to go home	Meɖoe be mayi aƒe
I have to do it.	Ele be mawɔe.
It makes sense, actually.	Susu le eme, le nyateƒe me.
If only he had lived.	Ne ɖe wònɔ agbe hafi.
But tonight something went wrong.	Gake le zã sia me la, nane gblẽ.
I was surprised, actually.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
And it doesn’t matter in any way.	Eye mehiã le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I tried everything.	Mete nusianu kpɔ.
I needed to do something about it	Ehiã be mawɔ nane tso eŋu
I still am, actually	Megale nenema kokoko, le nyateƒe me
He likes you.	Wò nu lé dzi nɛ.
I wasn’t happy	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o
Not on its own.	Menye le eɖokui si o.
I could talk to him for hours, about anything	Mate ŋu aƒo nu kplii gaƒoƒo geɖe, tso nusianu ŋu
I’m not sure if it’s true	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be enye nyateƒe o
I have been waiting for a very long time.	Mele lalam ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
This is different.	Esia to vovo.
I always struggle	Mewɔa avu ɣesiaɣi
It didn’t do much work.	Mewɔ dɔ boo aɖeke o.
If something goes wrong.	Ne nane gblẽ.
I do the work on their behalf	Mewɔa dɔa ɖe wo teƒe
I could see right through them	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu to wo me tututu
No one does this on their own.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa esia le eɖokui si o.
I was definitely going to die	Menɔ ku ge godoo
I couldn’t open my eyes	Nyemete ŋu ʋu ŋku o
I can do it better than you	Mate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu wò
I saw a small hole just below me	Mekpɔ do sue aɖe le nye te tututu
I am giving you one chance	Mele mɔnukpɔkpɔ ɖeka nam wò
I don’t know my own mind	Nyemenya nye ŋutɔ nye susu o
Things are not the same as they used to be.	Nuwo mele abe tsã ene o.
Go to another city.	Yi du bubu me.
I tried calling him yesterday	Medze agbagba be maƒo ka nɛ etsɔ
OH! 	O!
Thank you thank you thank you thank you.	Akpe na wò akpe na wò akpe na wò akpe na wò.
There is nothing that is bothering you.	Naneke meli si le fu ɖem na wò o.
I saw a lot of great things happen	Mekpɔ nu gã geɖe dzɔ
And we had water.	Eye tsi nɔ mía si.
Without it, he cannot win.	Ema manɔmee la, mate ŋu aɖu dzi o.
He may be the only voice here, too.	Ðewohĩ eya ɖeka koe nye gbe le afisia hã.
But go to a better place.	Gake yi teƒe si nyo wu.
Your people have won.	Wò amewo ɖu dzi.
I wanted to see what they were doing	Medi be makpɔ nusi wɔm wole
We can go on and on.	Míate ŋu ayi edzi.
I know this is probably not headed in a good place	Menya be ɖewohĩ esia meɖo ta teƒe nyui aɖeke o
I want to live with it	Medi be manɔ agbe kplii
I don’t want to live	Nyemedi be manɔ agbe o
He didn’t see it coming.	Mekpɔ be gbɔna o.
Create a new project.	Wɔ dɔ yeye aɖe.
I don’t want to look away.	Nyemedi be maɖe ŋku ɖa o.
Any idea of ​​what might be wrong.	Susu ɖesiaɖe si ku ɖe nusi ate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ ŋu.
I think that’s amazing	Mesusu be esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
And he won’t do that either.	Eye mawɔe nenema hã o.
I think that would be all	Mesusu be ema koe anye
And this guy is a teacher.	Eye ŋutsu sia nye nufiala.
It is very personal and depends on many factors.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ ŋutɔ eye wònɔ te ɖe nu geɖe dzi.
After that, everything changed.	Le ema megbe la, nusianu trɔ.
A reasonable mindset.	Susu si me susu le.
He wouldn’t make that mistake twice.	Mawɔ vodada ma zi eve o.
Something changed in me.	Nane trɔ le ŋunye.
I can’t handle this	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ o
And he didn’t listen to anyone.	Eye meɖo to ame aɖeke o.
I'll see you soon	Mava kpɔ wò kpuie
Just simple parallels	Nu bɔbɔe siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo koe

I prayed as usual	Medo gbe ɖa abe tsã ene
I think it’s true, every dog ​​has its day.	Mesusu be enye nyateƒe, avu ɖesiaɖe kple eƒe ŋkeke.
Some of them, of course.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo ya.
That didn’t last long.	Ema menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.

I’ve done this before, at home	Mewɔ esia do ŋgɔ, le aƒeme

Looks like there must be something here.	Edze abe ɖe wòle be nane nanɔ afisia ene.
I’m a kid who’s never doing any good.	Nyee nye ɖevi si mele nyui aɖeke wɔm gbeɖe o.

But think about that.	Gake bu nya ma ŋu kpɔ.
His face was fixed on his work.	Eƒe mo nɔ eƒe dɔa ŋu.
It all depends on what you have.	Nusianu nɔ te ɖe nusi le asiwò dzi.

I don’t know what he can do	Nyemenya nusi wòate ŋu awɔ o
I never knew you before today	Nyemenya wò do ŋgɔ egbea kpɔ o

Or that he would be so brave.	Alo be dzi anɔ eme ale gbegbe.

Yet this is not surprising.	Ke hã esia mewɔ nuku o.
I might have to do something about that	Ðewohĩ ahiã be mawɔ nane tso ema ŋu
He didn’t know what he was doing beforehand.	Menya nusi wɔm wòle do ŋgɔ o.

And through them, by mistake.	Eye to wo dzi, le vodada me.
A very large one, too	Gã ŋutɔ aɖe hã
But that also seems unlikely.	Gake edze abe ema hã mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.
I had never heard of this before	Nyemese nya sia kpɔ o
Not that he didn’t have attitude.	Menye be nɔnɔme aɖeke menɔ esi o.
Do it quickly.	Wɔe kaba.
There seems to be something here.	Edze abe nane le afisia ene.
I would love to do it.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔe.
I just want to get out of here	Ðeko medi be mado le afisia
I could feel that we were working together.	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me be míele dɔ wɔm ɖekae.

And I can go on and on.	Eye mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim.

In some cases, that may not work.	Le go aɖewo me la, ɖewohĩ ema maɖe vi o.

No one represented them.	Ame aɖeke menɔ wo teƒe o.

I need something really quick.	Mehiã nane si awɔ kaba ŋutɔŋutɔ.

It’s really clear.	Eme kɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.

I have never seen anything so beautiful in my life	Nyemekpɔ naneke si nya kpɔ alea le nye agbe me kpɔ o

I told you what we would do and why	Megblɔ nu si míawɔ kple nu si tae míawɔ la na mi
There is only you and me.	Nye kple wò koe li.

Perhaps he had been impressed.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi kpɔ.
It was for no other reason.	Susu bubu aɖeke tae wònɔ o.
I have my reasons for doing this	Susu siwo tae mewɔ esia ɖo la le asinye
You’re so glad you have them.	Edzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ be wole asiwò.
Probably easier to find them, if nothing else.	Ðewohĩ wo didi bɔbɔe wu, ne menye nu bubu aɖeke o.
I need you in my life too badly	Mehiã wò le nye agbe me vevie akpa
You can remove that now.	Àte ŋu aɖe ema ɖa fifia.
I need one tomorrow	Mehiã ɖeka etsɔ
I came to see you	Meva kpɔ wò
But that is also a mistake.	Gake ema hã nye vodada.
You know a guy who can take anything, you say.	Ènya ŋutsu aɖe si ate ŋu axɔ nusianu, ègblɔ.
It would be a great thing.	Anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Maybe someone here can tell me what's wrong.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe le afisia ate ŋu agblɔ nusi gblẽ la nam.
This is a very good one.	Esia nyo ŋutɔ.
What is his name?.	Ŋkɔ kae nye eƒe?.
Which is very surprising.	Nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That could happen.	Ema ate ŋu adzɔ.
This is a good idea, but it’s not true.	Esia nye susu nyui aɖe, gake menye nyateƒe o.
He could be a good guy.	Ate ŋu anye ame nyui aɖe.
What you have done is amazing.	Nusi nèwɔ la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Check out this place.	Kpɔ teƒe sia ɖa.
I just want to know if you’re okay	Ðeko medi be manya nenye be èle nyuie
There is a job to be done.	Dɔ aɖe li woawɔ.
Set this aside as well.	Tsɔ esia hã ɖe vovo.
I don’t understand what just happened	Nyemese nusi dzɔ teti koe nye ema gɔme o
There is absolutely no money.	Ga aɖeke kura meli o.
I came pretty close several times though.	Meva te ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ zi geɖe gake.
I care much more about you.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò wu kura.
There are two reasons for this idea.	Susu eve aɖewo tae susu sia va ɖo.
I can’t be where you are	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afi si nèle o
I will call you personally	Maƒo ka na wò ŋutɔ
It’s facing us.	Edze ŋgɔ mí.
I always know what to expect	Menya nusi makpɔ mɔ na ɣesiaɣi
It will tell you a lot.	Agblɔ nya geɖe na wò.
And time is not on my side.	Eye ɣeyiɣi mele nye akpa dzi o.
He wouldn’t have done anything differently.	Anye ne mawɔ naneke si to vovo na ema o.
I know this is hard for you	Menya be esia sesẽ na wò
I liked that better.	Ema dzɔ dzi nam wu.
A lot of the kind of guys who wouldn’t do that.	Ŋutsu geɖe siwo ƒomevi mawɔ nenema o.
That means someone else did, of course.	Ema fia be ame bubu hã wɔe nenema ya.
I decided to stay there as well.	Meɖoe be manɔ afima hã.
It is a difficult problem.	Enye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
He didn’t stay there very long.	Menɔ afima eteƒe didi aɖeke o.
That was just a song for that time.	Ha aɖe koe ema nye na ɣeyiɣi ma.
It never was, it never will be.	Menɔ anyi kpɔ o, manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
There is no water or water.	Tsi alo tsi mele eme o.
I needed to do something quickly	Ehiã be mawɔ nane kaba
But he didn’t hear anything.	Gake mese naneke o.
There was no issue here.	Nya aɖeke menɔ afisia o.
I would love to do more	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔ geɖe wu
We can eat the right things.	Míate ŋu aɖu nu siwo sɔ.
These rules are very difficult to do well.	Se siawo wɔwɔ nyuie sesẽ ŋutɔ.
One year is too long.	Ƒe ɖeka didi akpa.
I can’t put anything together	Nyemate ŋu aƒo naneke nu ƒu ɖekae o
The case in this case is quite different.	Nya si le go sia me la to vovo kura.
But nothing will come.	Gake naneke mava o.
There is a problem.	Kuxi aɖe li.
I was completely nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe kura.
I just want to be in the here and now	Ðeko medi be manɔ afisia kple fifia la me
He had the car.	Ʋua nɔ esi.
A great person.	Ame gã aɖe.
He did not say where he lived.	Megblɔ afisi wòle o.
This will usually not work.	Zi geɖe la, esia mawɔ dɔ o.
I am at peace now.	Nye dzi dze eme fifia.
I can’t handle anything more	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ naneke si wu ema gbɔ o
I cannot allow this	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ ɖe esia ŋu o
I didn’t like this part of it	Eƒe akpa sia medze ŋunye o
There is so much he doesn’t know.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li si menya o.
They are going through a very difficult time.	Wole ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ me tom.
I can’t say who it is.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ amesi wònye o.
I must not succumb to that promised happiness	Mele be maɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu ɖe dzidzɔ ma si ŋugbe medo la me o
The other is different.	Bubu la to vovo.
I couldn’t catch a thought at all	Nyemete ŋu lé susu aɖeke kura o
I can’t tell him that though	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma nɛ o gake
I shouldn’t have to put up with this	Mele be mado dzi le esia me o
I haven't had one like this for two years	Ƒe eve enye sia si ɖeke mele asinye abe esia ene o
Before, not yet.	Do ŋgɔ na la, menye haɖe o.
I saw someone inside	Mekpɔ ame aɖe le eme
So are you, too.	Nenema ke wò hã nèle.
I heard your every word and every word	Mese wò nya sia nya kple nya sia nya
Things are going well now.	Nuwo le edzi yim nyuie fifia.
Now I would like to do that.	Azɔ madi be mawɔe nenema.
A bad thought entered his head	Susu gbegblẽ aɖe ge ɖe eƒe ta me
But he can remember.	Gake ate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi.
I didn’t see your car	Nyemekpɔ wò ʋua o
You know this.	Ènya esia.
I know you, of course	Menya wò ya
That stuck in my mind.	Nya ma tsi susu me nam.
That was my first mistake.	Emae nye nye vodada gbãtɔ.
Much work is still needed	Dɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ hiã
It doesn’t have to be me.	Mehiã be nyee o.
I think it was probably a difficult thing	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ enye nu sesẽ aɖe
I just kind of fell into things	Ðeko medze nuwo me le mɔ aɖe nu
I grew up next door.	Metsi le aƒe si te ɖe eŋu me.
Everyone is talking about it.	Amesiame le nu ƒom tso eŋu.
I couldn’t go on	Nyemete ŋu yi edzi o
I’ve always really liked him	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ ɣesiaɣi
I don’t know anything about this	Nyemenya naneke tso esia ŋu o
I need to be able to do this.	Ele be mate ŋu awɔ esia.
I hope you can help me.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
It’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I have nothing in my life	Naneke mele asinye le nye agbe me o
This may not be so useful.	Ðewohĩ esia maɖe vi nenema gbegbe o.
I can actually make this work.	Mate ŋu ana esia nawɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I didn’t know what to say or do	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ alo nusi mawɔ o
If you were there, you know what happened.	Ne èle afi ma la, ke ènya nusi dzɔ.
And all is going well.	Eye nuwo katã le edzi yim nyuie.
It was amazing that morning.	Ewɔ nuku na ame ŋdi ma.
I asked who it could be	Mebia be amekae wòate ŋu anye hã
I could have killed you just now	Anye ne mate ŋu awu wò fifia ko hafi
Looks like a likely year.	Edze abe ƒe si anya nɔ eme ene.
I could feel my heart .	Mete ŋu se nye dzi gɔme .
Like so many others.	Abe ame geɖe ŋutɔ ene.
Under no circumstances.	Le nɔnɔme aɖeke me o.
I can’t remember being a kid	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi be menye ɖevi sue o
I am something different now	Menye nane si to vovo fifia
Maybe it’s more than that.	Ðewohĩ esia wu nenema.
I knew almost nothing about them	Nyemenya naneke kloe tso wo ŋu o
You have a mental issue.	Susu me nya aɖe le ŋuwò.
I am not okay with that at all	Nyemele nyuie le nya ma ŋu kura o
I think we have a lot of problems	Mesusu be kuxi siwo le mía ŋu la sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ
I hope you enjoyed it!.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be edzɔ dzi na mi!.
I told him the truth.	Megblɔ nyateƒea nɛ.
I know by your face.	Menya to wò mo dzi.
I’m not going to die.	Nyemele ku ge o.
If anything, it has increased.	Ne nane li la, ke edzi ɖe edzi.
I can never get this last part right.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ akpa mamlɛtɔ sia nyuie gbeɖe o.
Maybe it’s not you.	Ðewohĩ menye wòe o.
No other work is required.	Dɔ bubu aɖeke mehiã o.
I had an empty pool	Ta aɖe si me ame aɖeke mele o nɔ asinye
I didn’t feel like much time had passed.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be ɣeyiɣi geɖe va yi o.
I explained to him.	Meɖe eme nɛ.
I'm watching them.	Mele wo kpɔm.
I just lost my temper	Ðeko nye dziku bu
Maybe just on foot.	Ðewohĩ le afɔ me ko.
I don’t think he will.	Nyemesusu be awɔe o.
I can’t let you go alone	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu aɖe asi le ŋuwò o
He will find a way.	Akpɔ mɔ aɖe.
Another thought occurred to me.	Susu bubu aɖe hã va susu me nam.
A week too long for my man.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka didi akpa na nye ŋutsu.
I took this issue, actually	Metsɔ nya sia, le nyateƒe me
I will be very strict in this chapter.	Mawɔ nu sesẽ ŋutɔ le ta sia me.
It’s the idea we’re looking for.	Enye susu si dim míele.
That would be really interesting	Ema ado dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔŋutɔ
I will stay with you.	Manɔ anyi ɖe ŋuwò.
It was very impressive	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
I will find them for you	Madi wo na wò
The time has come.	Ɣeyiɣi de.
We know this may not be possible.	Míenya be ɖewohĩ esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
That’s all anyone knows.	Ema koe nye nusi ame sia ame nya.
This was of great benefit to him.	Nya sia ɖe vi geɖe nɛ.
Or continue without.	Alo yi edzi manɔmee.
Part of it is shot	Eƒe akpa aɖe tu
That road is over.	Mɔ ma wu enu.
I lived by it.	Menɔ agbe ɖe enu.
I did everything differently	Mewɔ nusianu si to vovo
I don’t want to look too far ahead yet	Nyemedi be makpɔ nu ayi ŋgɔ akpa haɖe o
No one could touch him in that.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu ka asi eŋu le ema me o.
No one was too close.	Ame aɖeke mete ɖe eŋu akpa o.
Think about it for real.	Bu eŋu kpɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The head is the tae.	Ta la tae.
It has been a pleasure to work with him over the past two years.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be mewɔ dɔ kplii le ƒe eve siwo va yi me.
I liked this guy	Ŋutsu sia ƒe nu lé dzi nam
I would love to get to know you better.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be manya wò nyuie wu.
I am the only one here.	Nye ɖeka koe le afisia.
I don’t think that will happen yet	Nyemesusu be esia ava eme haɖe o
I knew within two days something was very different	Menya le ŋkeke eve me be nane to vovo kura
At some point in time.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me.
He had his time and place	Eƒe ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe nɔ esi
It’s actually a very interesting place.	Enye teƒe si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I can do anything with you on my back	Mate ŋu awɔ nusianu kple wò le nye megbe
I really enjoyed every job.	Dɔ ɖesiaɖe dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
All year round.	Ƒe bliboa katã.
This was important to him	Esia nɔ vevie nɛ
Stay with us.	Nɔ mía gbɔ.
I have so many people backing me	Ame geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye le megbe nam
I wanted him to do something else	Medi be wòawɔ nu bubu aɖe
I haven’t tried this yet	Nyemete esia kpɔ haɖe o
But I wouldn’t mind talking to him	Gake maɖe fu nam be maƒo nu kplii o
Have !.	Le esi !.
You have nothing here.	Naneke mele ŋuwò le afisia o.
I had no real reason to be there	Susu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke menɔ asinye si tae manɔ afima o
I looked inside and saw that it was very crowded	Mekpɔ eme eye mekpɔ be amewo sɔ gbɔ ɖe afima ŋutɔ
I just wanted to see how it was	Ðeko medi be makpɔ alesi wòle
I really enjoy what you are doing.	Nusi wɔm nèle la doa dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
I can do that.	Mate ŋu awɔ ema.
Change the order to effect.	Trɔ ɖoɖo si nu wole la be wòawɔ dɔ ɖe edzi.
I wish that were true	Ne ɖe nya ma nye nyateƒe la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
I wonder if this is possible.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe esia anya wɔ hã.
That’s a very good thing.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ.
One man beat me.	Ŋutsu ɖeka ƒom.
It’s not necessarily just money.	Menye ga koe wònye kokoko o.
I had no other reason	Susu bubu aɖeke menɔ asinye o
I couldn’t tell the truth	Nyemete ŋu gblɔ nyateƒea o
A man answered him.	Ŋutsu aɖe ɖo eŋu nɛ.
Why? 	Nu ka ta?
I was very pleased with it	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
With that in mind.	Esi nya ma le susu me na mí.
My voice came back.	Nye gbe trɔ gbɔ.
Today, almost everyone has a car.	Egbea la, ʋu le amesiame kloe si.
I was able to stop there.	Mete ŋu tɔ ɖe afima.
Many others did the same at this time.	Ame bubu geɖe hã wɔ nenema ke le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
But he committed suicide alone.	Gake eya ɖeka koe wu eɖokui.
I can tell he likes you	Mate ŋu agblɔ be wò nu lé dzi nɛ
I just got here yesterday	Ðeko meva afisia etsɔ koe nye ema
This will help you.	Esia akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I felt terrible for him	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ɖe eŋu
It’s not just anger.	Menye dziku koe o.
This is a good thing.	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe.
No one else is going to do it.	Ame bubu aɖeke mele ewɔ ge o.
I would do anything for him.	Mawɔ nusianu nɛ.
He didn’t understand this.	Mese nya sia gɔme o.
I want to know more about you	Medi be manya nu geɖe tso ŋuwò
I'm not sure which place sounds more interesting	Nyemeka ɖe teƒe si ɖi nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame wu dzi o
And so did I.	Eye nye hã.
I have met the most interesting people in years	Medo go ame siwo doa dzidzɔ nam wu le ƒe geɖe me
I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
I could try her house anyway	Mate ŋu ate eƒe aƒea kpɔ to mɔ sia mɔ nu
I found my way.	Mekpɔ nye mɔ.
But I will do it anyway.	Gake mawɔe nenema ke.
I don’t need to say anything else.	Mehiã be magblɔ nya bubu aɖeke o.
This thing here, it’s a trap.	Nu sia le afisia, enye mɔ̃.
It was a very good episode.	Enye akpa nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
But getting there won’t be easy.	Gake afima ɖoɖo manɔ bɔbɔe o.
And of course, there might not be.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ manɔ anyi o.
The work is very very clear.	Dɔa me kɔ ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
However, for now, no one does.	Ke hã, fifia la, ame aɖeke mewɔe o.
I can give you something good too	Mate ŋu ana nu nyui aɖe na wò hã
I was fine with either one	Menɔ nyuie le wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ŋu
That was a really tough year for me.	Ƒe ma nye ƒe sesẽ aɖe nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But without that.	Gake ema manɔmee.
This wasn’t going so well.	Esia menɔ edzi yim nyuie nenema o.
I never quite expected this	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na esia tututu gbeɖe o
It was a good thing for me.	Enye nu nyui aɖe nam.
It will do us all good .	Awɔ nyui na mí katã .
They were very impressed.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe wo dzi ŋutɔ.
Some kind of thought popped into his head	Susu aɖe ƒomevi do ɖe eƒe ta me
Something just didn’t sit right with him.	Ðeko nane menɔ anyi kplii nyuie o.
If only it wasn’t too late.	Ne ɖe metsi megbe akpa o la.
Everything suddenly irritated me	Nusianu do dziku nam zi ɖeka
The food that.	Nuɖuɖu si.
There wasn’t much time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe menɔ anyi o.
I don’t believe that.	Nyemeka ɖe nya ma dzi o.
So far everything has gone well.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
It didn’t surprise him.	Mewɔ nuku nɛ o.
And it can continue to be so.	Eye ate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ nenema.
I have to finish here	Ele be manɔ afisia awu enu
And now it’s impossible.	Eye fifia manya wɔ o.
I need to relax a bit	Ele be maɖe dzi ɖi vie
I definitely have to introduce this guy	Ele nam godoo be maɖe ŋutsu sia ɖe go
I hope it will be the first of many	Mele mɔ kpɔm be anye gbãtɔ le ame geɖe dome
I don't know about the type he has	Nyemenya nu tso ƒomevi si le esi ŋu o
And just like you really.	Eye abe wò ene ŋutɔŋutɔ.
A new one.	Yeye aɖe.
I was in it.	Menɔ eme.
Those who are respectable.	Ame siwo ŋu bubu le be.
And it’s not who he is.	Eye menye amekae o.
The whole thing, in this case, is me.	Nu bliboa, le go sia me la, nyee.
Now is the point.	Fifia nye nya la.
I was angry with him	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu
I haven’t been able to answer it yet	Nyemete ŋu ɖo eŋu haɖe o
I’ve never felt that way before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o
In about a year or so.	Le abe ƒe ɖeka alo esi wu nenema ene me.
There is no clear path for me.	Mɔ aɖeke meli si me kɔ nam o.
It’s not that small.	Menye nu sue ma gbegbe o.
I don’t have a good idea.	Menye susu nyui le asinye o.
I felt wet and looked down	Mese le ɖokuinye me be tsi le lãme nam eye mekpɔ ŋku ɖe anyi
Maybe the police will find us.	Ðewohĩ kpovitɔwo akpɔ mí.
I should have said something sooner	Ðe wòle be magblɔ nya aɖe kaba hafi
No one could tell me what to do.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu gblɔ nusi mawɔ nam o.
A building came into view	Xɔ aɖe va dze le amewo ŋu
I hope it helps you	Mele mɔ kpɔm be akpe ɖe ŋuwò
He was actually a very nice guy to work with.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
And he liked it that way.	Eye edzɔ dzi nɛ nenema.
It happened today.	Edzɔ egbea.
I can see the real me	Mete ŋu kpɔa nye ŋutɔŋutɔ
It could be a part of it.	Ate ŋu anye eƒe akpa aɖe.
I want you to be really focused	Medi be wò susu nanɔ nu ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ
I used to like him a lot.	Tsã la, eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I don’t know anything different	Nyemenya naneke si to vovo o
He can do that.	Ate ŋu awɔ ema.
He didn’t really care about me.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I did very little today.	Nu sue aɖe koe mewɔ egbea.
I am also familiar with this path	Nye hã menya nu tso mɔ sia ŋu nyuie
I can’t hear anything.	Nyemate ŋu ase naneke o.
I can’t answer that for myself either.	Nye hã nyemate ŋu aɖo nya ma ŋu na ɖokuinye o.
A new day.	Ŋkeke yeye aɖe.
I have to go to the police today.	Ele be mayi kpovitɔwo gbɔ egbea.
I tried to explain.	Medze agbagba be maɖe eme.
He was barely there.	Ƒã hafi wònɔ afima.
I am not sure myself	Nye ŋutɔ nyemeka ɖe edzi o
I am the one who is actually experiencing life.	Nyee nye amesi le agbe kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ.
In fact, this is a serious problem.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia nye kuxi gã aɖe.
The exact reason for it.	Susu si tututu le eŋu.
I wouldn’t have it.	Anye ne manɔ asinye o.
Which depends on time.	Nusi nɔ te ɖe ɣeyiɣi dzi.
I couldn’t escape.	Nyemete ŋu si dzo o.
I couldn’t imagine what was going on	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi nɔ edzi yim le susu me o
But there was no wind.	Gake ya aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
No one’s heart is in it.	Ame aɖeke ƒe dzi mele eme o.
A survivor just showed up at my house	Ðeko ame aɖe si tsi agbe la va nye aƒeme
There is a better way.	Mɔ aɖe li si nyo wu.
Just wanted to know if you have any ideas	Ðeko medi be manya ne susu aɖe le asiwò
You can’t tell what it is.	Màte ŋu anya nusi wònye o.
I can only imagine it all	Ðeko mate ŋu akpɔ wo katã le susu me
I said his name, over and over again	Megblɔ eƒe ŋkɔ, zi gbɔ zi geɖe
I heard his voice more than once.	Mese eƒe gbe wu zi ɖeka.
People have done it before.	Amewo wɔe kpɔ.
I have an idea now	Susu aɖe le asinye fifia
It can go anywhere.	Ate ŋu ayi afi sia afi.
Maybe I should have done it differently	Ðewohĩ ɖe wòle be mawɔe le mɔ bubu nu hafi
I can’t deal with him now	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu kplii fifia o
That is,.	Ema nye,.
Here are the reasons why.	Susu siwo tae wòle alea ɖoe nye esi.
And this isn’t the case either.	Eye esia hã mele eme o.
But overall, it’s pretty simple.	Gake le nusianu me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I was very, very pleased	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ŋutɔ
I can’t go on with it.	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi o.
It was a very small thing.	Enye nu sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
The water.	Tsi la.
Something that needs to be done more than years.	Nane si wòle be woawɔ wu ƒe geɖe.
I felt it too.	Nye hã mese le ɖokuinye me.
I really wanted to know what it was like	Medi vevie be manya ale si wòle
No one knows everything.	Ame aɖeke menya nusianu o.
I am and something else, something more	Nyee nye kple nu bubu aɖe, nane si wu nenema
These rules are on our side.	Se siawo le míaƒe akpa dzi.
But it wasn’t me.	Gake menye nyee o.
But not for anyone else at all.	Gake menye na ame bubu aɖeke kura o.
Stay on point.	Nɔ nya aɖe ŋu.
But look what happened to him.	Gake kpɔ nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi ɖa.
He had never done this before.	Mewɔ esia kpɔ o.
But, that’s life.	Gake, emae nye agbe.
That's just too good.	Ðeko ema nyo akpa.
Over and over again.	Zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I was moving forward.	Nyee nɔ ŋgɔ yim.
I hope the police find him soon	Mele mɔ kpɔm be kpovitɔwo ake ɖe eŋu kpuie
But this is not necessary.	Gake esia mehiã o.
I can make you do anything	Mate ŋu ana nàwɔ nusianu
Eventually, he will overcome it.	Mlɔeba la, aɖu edzi.
You can’t understand it at all.	Màte ŋu ase egɔme kura o.
I couldn’t turn around and see what it was	Nyemete ŋu trɔ kpɔ nusi wònye o
Death will reign.	Ku aɖu fia.
I really needed to stay focused	Ehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ be nye susu nanɔ nu ŋu
Come on, come on, come on.	Eya, eya, eya.
Life is neither of those.	Agbe menye wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
We knew there was a problem coming.	Míenya be kuxi aɖe gbɔna.
It’s the very last place.	Enye teƒe mamlɛtɔ tututu.
I can’t remember his name.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi o.

But I can’t tell him that	Gake nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma nɛ o
Yet he didn’t seem to worry much about himself.	Ke hã edze abe metsi dzi ɖe eɖokui ŋu boo o ene.
And it’s a little weird.	Eye ewɔ nuku vie.
None of them were seeking attention.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ amewo ƒe susu dim o.
I got sick of it.	Medze dɔ le eŋu.
He couldn’t promise.	Mete ŋu do ŋugbe o.
This problem is an old one.	Kuxi sia nye xoxo aɖe.
There was no voice.	Gbe aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I am not alone in feeling this way	Menye nye ɖeka koe se le ɖokuinye me alea o
I tried to do that.	Medze agbagba be mawɔe nenema.
I haven’t heard anything about that myself	Nye ŋutɔ nyemese naneke tso ema ŋu o
I think something is wrong with you.	Mesusu be nane gblẽ nu le ŋuwò.
I think this is going to be a great book.	Mesusu be esia ava nye agbalẽ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
He really needs to do something about it.	Ele be wòawɔ nane tso eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I thought it would help me	Mesusu be akpe ɖe ŋunye
Maybe he liked me.	Ðewohĩ nye nu lé dzi nɛ.
But consideration will be borne in mind.	Gake eŋu bubu anɔ susu me na ame.
That’s what it is now.	Emae nye ema fifia.
I knew what he was doing	Menya nu si wɔm wònɔ
I felt nervous	Mese le ɖokuinye me be metsi dzodzodzoe
Maybe it was some kind of house.	Ðewohĩ aƒe ƒomevi aɖee wònye.

In everything else we have to do.	Le nu bubu ɖesiaɖe si wòle be míawɔ me.
It was a shock to me	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
That is very true.	Nya ma nye nyateƒe ŋutɔ.
On the part in question.	Le akpa si ŋu nya ku ɖo ŋu.
But it’s not the same.	Gake menye nenema ke o.

I am so happy to be one of them.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be menye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
I could have done that.	Mate ŋu awɔe nenema hafi.
If he doesn’t do it tonight, he never will.	Ne mewɔe le zã sia me o la, mawɔe gbeɖe o.

I knew he would have my back	Menya be nye megbe anɔ esi
I really didn’t have much of a plan	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖoɖo boo aɖeke menɔ asinye o
But it all ended up working well	Gake wo katã va wu enu be woawɔ dɔ nyuie
There is no help for this.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke meli na esia o.

If he is working hard, he is a problem.	Ne ele dɔ wɔm sesĩe la, ke enye kuxi.
Things are broken.	Nuwo gblẽ.

And that was a huge mistake.	Eye vodada gã aɖee nye ema.

I can't help my voice speaking.	Nyemete ŋu nɔa te ɖe nye gbe si le nu ƒom la nu o.

One thing is clear.	Nu ɖeka me kɔ.
He never got there.	Meɖo afima kpɔ o.
There was nothing he could do about it anyway.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
It was a small thing.	Nu sue aɖee wònye.
In fact, that day may never come.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ ŋkeke ma mava gbeɖe o.
Too many feet.	Afɔ geɖe ŋutɔ.

That sounds pretty good.	Ema ɖi nya nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.

Check that out.	Kpɔ ema ɖa.

I had to make a plan	Ele be mawɔ ɖoɖo aɖe
I don’t know where he is or what happened to him.	Nyemenya afi si wòle alo nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi o.
Its obvious once you are inside.	Eƒe edze ƒã ne ènya le eme ko.
Always stay close to you.	Te ɖe ŋuwò ɣesiaɣi.
He would like to see them.	Adi be yeakpɔ wo.
Small moments.	Ɣeyiɣi sue aɖewo.
I’ve never felt that way before.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o.
I had no desire to fight him.	Didi aɖeke menɔ menye be mawɔ avu kplii o.
But this is much more complicated than that.	Gake esia sesẽ wu ema kura.

I can finish it.	Mate ŋu awu enu.
For many, many years now.	Ƒe geɖe, ƒe geɖe fifia.
He would be so happy.	Adzɔ dzi nɛ ale gbegbe.

Obviously we can’t.	Edze ƒã be míate ŋui o.

A good dog, actually.	Avu nyui aɖee wònye, le nyateƒe me.

I could do this all day.	Mate ŋu awɔ esia ŋkeke bliboa.
But nevertheless speak.	Gake ke hã ƒo nu.

I wanted to know what was in his heart	Medi be manya nu si le eƒe dzi me
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Naneke mate ŋu anɔ ŋgɔ wu nyateƒea o.
I couldn’t hear anything after that	Nyemete ŋu se naneke le ema megbe o
As that is the only reason.	Abe alesi ema koe nye susu si tae.
I don’t know what he’s going to do	Nyemenya nu si wòawɔ o
I just saw your face	Mekpɔ wò mo fifia ko
I couldn’t turn around	Nyemete ŋu trɔ ɖe megbe o
In every single room.	Le xɔ ɖeka ɖesiaɖe me.
But it really doesn’t work that way.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
I could very easily be like that	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema bɔbɔe ŋutɔ
His face changed.	Eƒe mo trɔ.
I might actually do something about you yet	Ðewohĩ mawɔ nane ŋutɔŋutɔ tso ŋuwò haɖe

But he did not distance himself from it at all.	Gake meɖe eɖokui ɖa le eŋu kura o.

I can’t work with you anymore	Nyemate ŋu awɔ dɔ kpli wò azɔ o
You have more reason than he does.	Susu le asiwò wu eya.

He stopped, too.	Eya hã tɔ ya.

I didn’t know there was another one	Nyemenya be bubu aɖe hã li o
That does what you want.	Ema wɔa nusi dim nèle.
There was just something about it.	Ðeko nane nɔ eŋu.

I don’t want to be with them.	Nyemedi be manɔ wo gbɔ o.
But he could not be sure that this was true.	Gake mete ŋu ka ɖe edzi be nya sia nye nyateƒe o.
I was shocked and angry	Ewɔ nuku nam eye medo dziku
The last thing he wants is respect.	Nu mamlɛtɔ si dim wòle ye nye bubu.
I did it as fast as I could.	Mewɔe kaba ale si mate ŋui.
It was a very extreme thing.	Enye nusi gbɔ eme ŋutɔ.

There is nothing to fight about.	Naneke meli woawɔ avu le o.

And a smaller dog.	Eye avu si le sue wu hã.
I have nothing or no one to live up to	Naneke alo ame aɖeke mele asinye manɔ agbe ɖe enu o
Maybe I should book it	Ðewohĩ ele be mawɔ agbalẽ ɖe edzi
And it’s smart.	Eye edze aɖaŋu.

You know that guy made me a lot of money.	Ènya be ŋutsu ma kpɔ ga geɖe nam.

Now they have two currencies.	Fifia ga eve le wo si.
That’s good for all of us.	Ema nyo na mí katã.
Things are broken.	Nuwo gblẽ.
But there was something more to it.	Gake nane nɔ eme wu ema.
I had to tell him something else	Ele be magblɔ nya bubu aɖe nɛ
This is a difficult issue.	Esia nye nya sesẽ aɖe.
I’m never looking for anything in return.	Nyemele naneke dim ɖe eteƒe gbeɖe o.

I'm just not sure where it is	Ðeko nyemeka ɖe afi si wòle dzi o
I know he doesn’t want that kind of reputation	Menya be medi be ŋkɔ nyui nanɔ ye ŋu nenema o
Many of them have day jobs.	Gbe ɖeka ƒe dɔ le wo dometɔ geɖe si.
I'm like you just broke your sweat	Mele abe wò fifia koe gblẽ ene
This takes time and people.	Esia bia ɣeyiɣi kple amewo.

I had no idea he was going to do that	Nyemenya kura be ele ema wɔ ge o
I’ve never seen anyone impressive	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke si wɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi kpɔ o
I just couldn’t remember anything about it	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku naneke dzi le eŋu o
For this reason.	Na susu sia.
This turned out pretty good.	Esia va nyo ŋutɔ.
It was the first time.	Enye zi gbãtɔ.
You now need to focus on the days and weeks ahead.	Ele be wò susu nanɔ ŋkeke kple kwasiɖa siwo gbɔna ŋu azɔ.
He would have no one else.	Ame bubu aɖeke manɔ esi o.
I can’t talk to him now	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu kplii fifia o
I probably wasn’t going to though.	Anɔ eme be nyemele ewɔ ge o ke hã.
I didn’t know who was behind us either	Nyemenya amesi nɔ megbe na mí hã o
He had never been there.	Menɔ afima kpɔ o.
But he didn’t touch her.	Gake meka asi eŋu o.
At least so far.	Vaseɖe fifia ya teti.
This is not a bad idea.	Esia menye susu gbegblẽ o.
I actually did, several times	Mewɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ, zi geɖe
The point is correct.	Nya la sɔ.
He didn’t know where they were.	Menya afi si wole o.
I know who he is now	Menya amesi wònye fifia
I didn’t hear about it until this morning.	Nyemese eŋu nya o vaseɖe ŋdi sia.
They have to do what he did.	Ele be woawɔ nusi wòwɔ.
It is part of this house.	Enye aƒe sia ƒe akpa aɖe.

That wouldn’t surprise me, really.	Ema mawɔ nuku nam o, le nyateƒe me.
Every part of you.	Wò akpa ɖesiaɖe.
And that’s the annoying thing.	Eye emae nye nu si doa dziku na ame.
You might as well tell me what it is you did.	Àte ŋu agblɔ nusi wònye nèwɔ nam nenema ke.
I could be asking for more	Mate ŋu anɔ nu geɖe biam
A lot of things have changed.	Nu geɖe trɔ.
I don’t mean to offend you	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mado dziku na wò o
People treat you better.	Amewo wɔa nu ɖe ​​ŋuwò nyuie wu.
It couldn’t have been that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema hafi o.
I don’t know where these others are from	Nyemenya afi si ame bubu siawo tso o
You have a lot going on.	Nu geɖe le edzi yim le asiwò.

I really needed to talk to someone	Ehiã vevie be maƒo nu kple ame aɖe
He can understand it.	Ate ŋu ase egɔme.
And my heart was broken.	Eye nye dzi gblẽ le ŋunye.
I can’t imagine	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nu tso susu me o
Not surprising, really.	Mewɔ nuku o, le nyateƒe me.
I actually have no dog in that dog.	Le nyateƒe me la, avu aɖeke mele asinye le avu ma me o.
There is nothing here.	Naneke mele afisia o.
I don’t believe that	Nyemeka ɖe nya ma dzi o
I am not ready for this	Nyemele klalo na esia o
I never knew that stuff	Nyemenya nu ma kpɔ o
I can only emphasize once more how important this is.	Ðeko mate ŋu ate gbe ɖe alesi esia le vevie dzi zi ɖeka ake.
But that is a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖee nye ema.
Two aspects of this surprised me	Esia ƒe akpa eve wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
I need to do more.	Ele be mawɔ geɖe wu.
I wasn’t alone for long	Menye nye ɖeka koe nɔ anyi eteƒe didi o

This will be exciting.	Esia ado dzidzɔ na ame.
He will be anonymous.	Anye ame si ŋkɔ mele o.
As it was, it was.	Abe alesi wònɔ ene.
It may or may not fuse.	Ate ŋu aƒo ƒu alo maƒo ƒu o.

I wanted to stay and help	Medi be manɔ anyi akpe asi ɖe eŋu
I couldn’t in the past	Nyemate ŋui le ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me o
I just don’t know exactly when	Ðeko nyemenya ɣeyiɣi si tututu wòawɔ o
I did this a few times.	Mewɔ esia zi ʋɛ aɖewo.
I can’t handle anything	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ naneke gbɔ o
That’s all that helped me.	Nusi kpe ɖe ŋunye koe nye ema.
None of them knew him personally.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menya eya ŋutɔ o.
I never understood this about myself	Nyemese nya sia gɔme le ɖokuinye ŋu kpɔ o
Things we know well.	Nu siwo míenya nyuie.
He wasn’t happy.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
That seemed to work well for them.	Edze abe ema wɔ dɔ nyuie na wo ene.
Something else is wrong.	Nu bubu aɖe hã gblẽ.
I have never felt so close to someone so quickly	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be mete ɖe ame aɖe ŋu kaba nenema gbegbe o
Your job is done.	Wò dɔa wu enu.

Things seem to be working well.	Edze abe nuwo le dɔ wɔm nyuie ene.
This is a very real possibility at this point.	Esia nye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutɔ le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
I just stood there.	Ðeko metsi tre ɖe afima.

He had the time.	Ɣeyiɣi nɔ esi.
I’m interested in it.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme.

You can do it.	Àte ŋu awɔe.
Maybe I should do that.	Ðewohĩ ele be mawɔe nenema.
The summer is here.	Dzomeŋɔli ɖo.
I didn't intend to be too personal	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔ nu ɖe ​​ame ŋutɔ ŋu akpa o
I was almost there anyway	Menɔ afima kloe le mɔ sia mɔ nu

He will rejoice in his own people.	Akpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eya ŋutɔ ƒe amewo ŋu.
I would have liked to have had a little longer	Anye ne madi be ɣeyiɣi didi vie nanɔ asinye hafi
I didn’t have time to find one	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye madi ɖeka o
I had everything	Nusianu nɔ asinye
I decided to do something else this morning	Meɖoe be mawɔ nu bubu aɖe ŋdi sia
Take off that dress	Ðe awu ma .
I knew what would happen.	Menya nusi adzɔ.
He threw his hand away.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ƒu gbe.

Be careful with that one.	Kpɔ nyuie le ɖeka ma ŋu.

We don’t have a last name.	Ŋkɔ mamlɛtɔ mele mía si o.
Perhaps there is a reason.	Ðewohĩ susu aɖe li si tae.

Or listen to one, for that matter.	Alo ɖo to ɖeka, le nya ma ta.
I was worried this would be a problem today	Metsi dzi be esia anye kuxi egbea
You don’t know exactly how you’re going to achieve this.	Mènya alesi tututu nàwɔ aɖo esia gbɔ o.
That was very impressive.	Ema wɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.

Many others will still do so.	Ame bubu geɖe hã awɔe nenema kokoko.

But it is not at all.	Gake menye nenema kura o.
I want to be in it.	Medi be manɔ eme.
Go ahead, tell me he deserves it.	Yi edzi, gblɔ nam be edze nɛ.
Perhaps he escaped.	Ðewohĩ esi.
He was the only person there.	Eya ɖeka koe nye ame si nɔ afima.
You are everything to me.	Wòe nye nusianu nam.

It would be easier if he was there.	Anɔ bɔbɔe wu nenye be ele afima.

I had never heard of it	Nyemese eŋu nya kpɔ o
Men who don’t care that much.	Ŋutsu siwo metsɔ ɖe le eme nenema gbegbe o.
He fell into it.	Edze anyi ɖe eme.
I thought something was wrong	Mesusu be nane gblẽ
The only thing that is real is this moment, now.	Nu ɖeka si nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ koe nye ɣeyiɣi sia, fifia.
We are happy for that.	Dzi dzɔa mí ɖe ema ta.
Anyone have any idea?.	Ame aɖe si susu aɖe le?.
I know this very well	Menya nya sia nyuie
Some people do that to you.	Ame aɖewo wɔa nu ma ɖe ŋuwò.
That hurt his character.	Ema gblẽ nu le eƒe nɔnɔme ŋu.
Many of these issues are not new.	Nya siawo dometɔ geɖe menye nu yeye o.
I was finally happy	Meva kpɔ dzidzɔ mlɔeba
No one was happy to see us.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ dzidzɔ be yekpɔ mí o.
He was one of many children	Enye ɖevi geɖe dometɔ ɖeka
I could be anywhere	Mate ŋu anɔ afi sia afi
Within a day or two we had things.	Le ŋkeke ɖeka alo eve me la, nuwo va nɔ mía si.
Something completely different.	Nane si to vovo kura.
I couldn’t have done it without you.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe wò manɔmee o.
And he didn’t give himself any food, either.	Eye metsɔ nuɖuɖu aɖeke na eɖokui o, eya hã.
I think he will live up to it	Mesusu be anɔ agbe ɖe enu
We don’t know anything.	Míenya naneke o.
I don’t know what to do	Nyemenya nu si mawɔ o
I didn’t intend to do this	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔ esia o
I know who he is.	Menya amesi wònye.
Do this the night before.	Wɔ esia le zã si do ŋgɔ me.
This works very well.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
I guess it’s not a good plan, but it didn’t get any better	Mesusu be menye ɖoɖo nyui aɖeke o, gake mexɔ ɖeke si nyo wu o
That’s what you are.	Wòe nye ema.
I did the opposite	Mewɔ nu si to vovo na emae
We were more than happy.	Dzi dzɔ mí wu ema.
I will know when soon.	Manya ɣekaɣie kpuie.
But there has to be a way.	Gake ele be mɔ aɖe nanɔ anyi.
I had never heard her voice so loud	Nyemese eƒe gbe ɖi sesĩe nenema gbegbe kpɔ o
I just started going at it.	Ðeko medze egɔme nɔ edzi yim teti koe nye ema.
I definitely grew very fond of him	Meva nɔ eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ godoo
I needed a new life.	Mehiã agbe yeye.
This is simply not true.	Ðeko esia menye nyateƒe o.
A name that will last for two thousand years	Ŋkɔ si anɔ anyi ƒe akpe eve
It is the right thing to do.	Enye nu si sɔ be woawɔ.
I have more than enough space in my house	Teƒe si sɔ gbɔ wu le asinye le nye aƒeme
I can’t talk to him	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu kplii o
I think they’re great	Mesusu be wole gã ŋutɔ
I shouldn’t be here	Mele be manɔ afisia o
He can’t feel anything.	Mate ŋu ase naneke le eɖokui me o.
A face began to form in his mind.	Mo aɖe te wɔwɔ ɖe eƒe susu me.
I couldn’t understand it.	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme o.
I think it will come in now	Mesusu be ava ɖo eme fifia
And it was only for one night.	Eye zã ɖeka koe wònye.
I really have nothing for them.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke mele asinye na wo o.
No one cared about me at all.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam kura o.
I wondered why that was.	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukatae wòle nenema hã.
If no one stands up for them.	Ne ame aɖeke metsi tre ɖe wo ta o.
I knew he could take care of himself	Menya be ate ŋu akpɔ eɖokui dzi
I hope that helps you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ema akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
But it’s you.	Gake wòe.
I was angry, but not really at him	Medo dziku, gake menye ɖe eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I want to marry them all	Medi be maɖe wo katã
I just have it.	Ðeko wòle asinye.
I think he was tired	Mesusu be ɖeɖi te eŋu
Excellent work but its my time now	Dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ gake eƒe nye ɣeyiɣi fifia
I knew it was on its way	Menya be ele mɔ dzi gbɔna
Medi ga ma.	Medi ga ma.
I couldn’t hold my attention	Nyemete ŋu lé nye susu ɖe te o
It really never matters.	Le nyateƒe me la, mehiã gbeɖe o.
I want to move forward.	Medi be mayi ŋgɔ.
He couldn’t get out of here.	Mete ŋu tso afisia o.
I always liked you too	Wò hã dzɔa dzi nam ɣesiaɣi
I don’t know after that.	Nyemenya le ema megbe o.
He could just stay here.	Ðeko wòate ŋu anɔ afisia.
Literally anything can be there.	Nusianu ŋutɔŋutɔ ate ŋu anɔ afima.
I can’t fight this on my own	Nyemate ŋu awɔ avu kple esia le ɖokuinye si o
I am very confident in it.	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.
I understood what he was going through	Mese nusi me tom wònɔ la gɔme
I shouldn’t have come to work today.	Mele be mava dɔme egbea hafi o.
Many people have tried.	Ame geɖe dze agbagba kpɔ.
I have to do that.	Ele be mawɔe nenema.
Almost every house was affected.	Aƒe ɖesiaɖe kloe gblẽ nu le eŋu.
I don’t know where we are	Nyemenya afisi míele o
I can’t let them go	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le wo ŋu o
It doesn’t really matter.	Mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
That is impossible, of course.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o ya.
Car can do it in four.	Ʋu ate ŋu awɔe le ene me.
I had to tell them exactly what was on my mind.	Ele nam be magblɔ nu si tututu nɔ susu me nam la na wo.
I am definitely older	Metsi wu godoo
And it will work for him.	Eye awɔ dɔ ɖe edzi.
But not more than that.	Gake menye nusi wu ema o.
I like things as they are now	Nuwo dzɔa dzi nam abe alesi wole fifia ene
I hoped he wasn't worried	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be metsi dzi o
Which is not quite true.	Nusi menye nyateƒe tututu o.
There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eme o.
I didn’t know it was you	Nyemenya be wòe o
I’m glad he’s a night person	Edzɔ dzi nam be enye zã me ame
I really need some food	Mehiã nuɖuɖu aɖewo ŋutɔŋutɔ
It was just his real voice.	Eƒe gbe ŋutɔŋutɔ koe wònye.
But it’s not something he can do for a job.	Gake menye nane si wòate ŋu awɔ na dɔ aɖe o.
And you’re the obvious one at this point.	Eye wòe nye ame si dze ƒã le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
I couldn’t eat anything	Nyemete ŋu ɖu naneke o
I can’t let him do that	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ nɛ wòawɔ nu ma o
That was very much about me.	Ema ku ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ.
I knew he would be on our side	Menya be anɔ míaƒe akpa dzi
I understand what he’s going through right now	Mese nusi me wòle fifia gɔme
But there is a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖe li.
A big deal, you know.	Nya gã aɖe, ènya.
Yet the reality is not so simple.	Ke hã nu ŋutɔŋutɔ mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
I quickly stepped back	Meɖe afɔ ɖe megbe kaba
I’ve never seen much of anyone.	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke ƒe nu geɖe kpɔ o.
This is for.	Esia nye na.
I needed to stay focused	Ehiã be nye susu nanɔ nu ŋu
I know exactly where to go next	Menya afisi tututu mayi edzi le
This is not one of them.	Esia menye wo dometɔ ɖeka o.
People are always angry with me too.	Amewo hã doa dziku ɖe ŋunye ɣesiaɣi.
I know you like her	Menya be eƒe nu lé dzi na wò
I just didn’t know anyone else came here	Ðeko nyemenya be ame bubu aɖeke va afisia o
And you can’t prove anything.	Eye màte ŋu aɖo kpe naneke dzi o.
Everything was in order.	Nusianu nɔ ɖoɖo nu.
But somehow this worked.	Gake le mɔ aɖe nu la, esia wɔ dɔ.
I didn’t really look there	Nyemekpɔ afima ŋutɔŋutɔ o
No one can take that away from you.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ ema le asiwò o.
I have so much to do	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye mawɔ
I have a busy day tomorrow	Ŋkeke si dzi vovo mele ŋunye o le asinye etsɔ
I think we’re all in a better place	Mesusu be mí katã míele teƒe si nyo wu
There is no role at all.	Akpa aɖeke meli kura o.
He is a happy dog.	Enye avu si kpɔa dzidzɔ.
I just didn’t have much of a reason to go	Ðeko susu boo aɖeke menɔ asinye si ta mayi o
Just to talk about it.	Be maƒo nu ko.
I couldn’t look away.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe ŋku ɖa o.
This really could have happened to anyone.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ ɖe ame sia ame dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ hafi.
Today's money.	Egbea ga.
Maybe this, maybe that.	Ðewohĩ esia, ɖewohĩ ema.
I can’t stand it anymore	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi azɔ o
Go back and continue.	Trɔ yi edzi yi.
None of us can stand it.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu o.
I can help you with that	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò le ema me
A very big deal.	Nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I think it might get to some point	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ aɖo afi aɖe
I was so skeptical.	Meke ɖi ale gbegbe.
I was worried about it.	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu.
This seems to be true, at least in some cases.	Edze abe esia nye nyateƒe le nɔnɔme aɖewo me ya teti ene.
But there seemed to be none.	Gake edze abe ɖeke menɔ eme o ene.
I wonder what it is.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae.
I was going to tell him that	Menɔ nya ma gblɔ ge nɛ
I want to know the truth	Medi be manya nyateƒea
Everyone has time.	Ɣeyiɣi le amesiame si.
This paper makes two innovations in this area.	Agbalẽ sia wɔ nu yeye eve le go sia me.
That’s what they’re looking for.	Emae nye nusi dim wole.
I let you off easy before	Meɖe asi le ŋuwò bɔbɔe do ŋgɔ
I can’t believe what you have here	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nusi le asiwò le afisia dzi ase o
They will be working.	Woawɔ dɔ.
That just wouldn’t work.	Ðeko ema mawɔ dɔ o.
But he is not the right person.	Gake menye ame si sɔ o.
No one asked himself.	Ame aɖeke mebia eɖokui o.
He seems to be alone.	Edze abe eya ɖeka koe li ene.
It could happen at any hour.	Ate ŋu adzɔ gaƒoƒo ɖesiaɖe.
There was no one he could talk to about this.	Ame aɖeke menɔ anyi si wòate ŋu aƒo nu tso nya sia ŋu na o.
I am just one man.	Ŋutsu ɖeka koe menye.
That was very bad.	Ema gblẽ nu ŋutɔ.
I know that place like the back of my hand	Menya teƒe ma abe nye asi ƒe megbe ene
I couldn’t be more surprised	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nuku nam wu ema o
Today was so good.	Egbea nyo ale gbegbe.
There doesn’t have to be one.	Mehiã be ɖeka nanɔ anyi o.
He just had a good idea	Ðeko susu nyui aɖe va susu me nɛ
But that’s actually a good thing.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
I couldn’t stand up very well	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te nyuie tututu o
Is that something else.	Ðe nu bubu aɖee nye ema.
If you don’t like it, get out.	Ne medze ŋuwò o la, do go.
Tell me what happened.	Gblɔ nusi dzɔ la nam.
But we only had one car.	Gake ʋu ɖeka koe nɔ mía si.
The loss of a possible part of his life.	Eƒe agbe ƒe akpa aɖe si ate ŋu adzɔ ƒe bu.
I didn’t feel that tired	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be ɖeɖi te ŋunye nenema gbegbe o
Everyone knows my name.	Amesiame nya nye ŋkɔ.
I think that’s a good thing	Mesusu be nu nyui aɖee nye ema
They are here.	Wole afisia.
Treat him kindly.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu nyuie.
I can’t call you after this	Nyemate ŋu aƒo ka na wò le esia megbe o
I want to get to know you	Medi be manya wò
This is better than that.	Esia nyo wu.
Maybe he didn’t.	Ðewohĩ mewɔe nenema o.
I am a decent gun.	Nyee nye tu si dze ame ŋu.
He couldn’t bear it at all.	Mete ŋu do dzi kura o.
It’s necessary these days.	Ehiã le ŋkeke siawo me.
There is nothing wrong with doing wrong.	Nu gbegblẽ wɔwɔ medze o.

I did that this year and I am having a great time.	Mewɔe nenema le ƒe sia me eye mele dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔ.
I think one of us should be there	Mesusu be ele be mía dometɔ ɖeka nanɔ afima
I’m glad he didn’t.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mewɔe nenema o.
I just wanted to make one tonight	Ðeko medi be mawɔ ɖeka le zã sia me
I had heard his name.	Mese eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ.
That appeals to me.	Ema dzɔa dzi nam.
I only have one shot at this	Tu ɖeka koe le asinye le esia ŋu
You can never know your dog.	Màte ŋu anya wò avu gbeɖe o.
That would be our passion.	Emae anye míaƒe didi vevie.
But get closer .	Gake te ɖe eŋu .
I'll see you soon.	Makpɔ wò kpuie.
I just said he had one.	Ðeko megblɔ be ɖeka le esi.
You need to deal with this.	Ele be nàwɔ nu ɖe ​​nu sia ŋu.

Glad to hear from him	Edzɔ dzi nam be mese eƒe nya
I can’t imagine what you’re going through	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi me tom nèle la le susu me o
I understand it now.	Mese egɔme azɔ.
We know what you are doing.	Míenya nusi wɔm nèle.
You’re in one place today, in another tomorrow.	Èle teƒe ɖeka egbea, le teƒe bubu etsɔ.
There is no hole.	Do aɖeke meli o.
Not much at all.	Menye nu geɖe kura o.

I have blood on me.	Ʋu le dzinye.

But he could not continue for long.	Gake mete ŋu yi edzi eteƒe didi o.

I can tell him about you and me	Mate ŋu agblɔ nye kple wò ŋu nya nɛ

Why, no one knows.	Nukatae, ame aɖeke menya o.

Something just caught my eye	Ðeko nane va dze nye ŋku dzi

He was a very great man.	Enye ŋutsu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can’t help it	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu o
Today, we are in a very different situation.	Egbea la, míele nɔnɔme si to vovo kura me.
Blood is a must.	Ʋu nye nusi wòle be woawɔ.
Still, he was very attracted to her.	Ke hã eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I want you to tell me everything	Medi be nàgblɔ nya sia nya nam

But he never expected this.	Gake mekpɔ mɔ na esia gbeɖe o.

I just want to marry you	Ðeko medi be maɖe wò
He didn't seem to like either of them.	Edze abe menye wo dometɔ aɖeke ƒe nu lé dzi nɛ o ene.
I have to make some calls	Ele be maƒo ka na ame aɖewo
But there is some good news.	Gake nya nyui aɖewo li.
I can’t tolerate it at this point	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ ɖe eŋu le ɣeyiɣi sia me o
Everyone told me to look for money.	Amesiame gblɔ nam be madi ga.
I am of course the odd one out	Nyee nye ame si mewɔ nuku o ya
I can’t, really.	Nyemate ŋui o, le nyateƒe me.
I know exactly where he is	Menya afisi tututu wòle
I don’t understand his state of mind	Nyemese eƒe susu ƒe nɔnɔme gɔme o
I couldn’t think of anything else	Nyemete ŋu bu nu bubu aɖeke ŋu o
There was little time left.	Ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe nɔ anyi.
Very impressive stuff.	Nu siwo wɔa dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.

I asked them where we could go	Mebia wo be afikae míate ŋu ayi hã
I would like to do that.	Madi be mawɔe nenema.
I don’t want to see them.	Nyemedi be makpɔ wo o.
That helped me a lot.	Ema kpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ.
I also stayed there for several nights, unable to leave	Metsi afima hã zã geɖe, eye nyemete ŋu dzo o
In fact, it is very important.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele vevie ŋutɔ.
A year has passed.	Ƒe ɖeka va yi.

I can go out and fight	Mate ŋu ado go anɔ avu wɔm
I am ready to share any moment in your life.	Mele klalo be magblɔ ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe na wò le wò agbe me.
I know what they are doing	Menya nusi wɔm wole
I work very hard	Mewɔa dɔ sesĩe ŋutɔ
The house is in the.	Aƒea me le.
At least for now.	Fifia ya teti ya teti.
The sender did not identify himself.	Ame si ɖoe ɖa la meɖe eɖokui fia o.

I still had a lot of skills	Aɖaŋu geɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ asinye
I just need a little time	Ðeko mehiã ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe
I didn’t mean to say that	Menye ɖe meɖoe be magblɔ nya ma o
I work very hard for these opportunities.	Mewɔa dɔ sesĩe ŋutɔ ɖe mɔnukpɔkpɔ siawo ta.
At this hour, it probably matters.	Le gaƒoƒo sia me la, anɔ eme be ele vevie.
Maybe that’s why?.	Ðewohĩ esia tae?.
I could have gone anywhere	Anye ne mate ŋu ayi afi sia afi hafi
In fact, you can’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, màte ŋui o.
I had no idea there was a child	Nyemenya kura be ɖevi aɖe li o
I wondered when that was	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɣekaɣie nye ema hã
I hurried out of the room	Mewɔ kaba do go le xɔa me
I haven’t heard that in a long time	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia nyemese nya ma o
I couldn’t figure out what was going on	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi nɔ edzi yim la dze sii o
That part was easy.	Akpa ma nɔ bɔbɔe.
But that was enough for me.	Gake ema sɔ gbɔ nam.
They are expecting this.	Wole mɔ kpɔm na esia.
I always do this.	Mewɔa esia ɣesiaɣi.
I couldn’t figure out what was wrong.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi gblẽ la dze sii o.
I also like your house	Wò aƒe hã dzɔa dzi nam
His tongue is involved.	Eƒe aɖe hã le eme.
This could happen for two reasons.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ le susu eve ta.
I was just food for him	Nuɖuɖu koe menye nɛ
I met him briefly	Medo go kpuie
I shouldn’t have been here.	Mele be manɔ afisia hafi o.
I do this.	Mewɔa esia.
I could want anything for him	Mate ŋu adi nusianu nɛ
He didn’t want that either.	Medi nenema hã o.
Nothing running like a week.	Naneke mele du dzi abe kwasiɖa ɖeka ene o.
We hardly knew each other.	Míenya mía nɔewo kura o.
He won’t talk to himself.	Maƒo nu na eɖokui o.
This is anything but true.	Esia nye nusianu si menye nyateƒe o.
However, this is not new.	Ke hã, esia menye nu yeye o.
It was obvious to me that he was not satisfied.	Edze ƒã nam be eƒe dzi medze eme o.
I was just there.	Ðeko menɔ afima.
I couldn’t write.	Nyemete ŋu ŋlɔ nu o.
But there is no help for this.	Gake kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke meli le esia ta o.
It’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I think he must have done something wrong	Mesusu be anya wɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖe
I found my voice.	Meke ɖe nye gbe ŋu.
There would have been nothing.	Anye ne naneke manɔ anyi o.
I can’t help you.	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò o.
But I will say one thing.	Gake magblɔ nya ɖeka.
And this means two things.	Eye esia fia nu eve.
Following these ideas takes the following form.	Susu siawo dzi wɔwɔ xɔa nɔnɔme si gbɔna me.
He can never stand it.	Mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu gbeɖe o.
I can do a lot of things	Mete ŋu wɔa nu geɖe
We know you better than anyone else.	Míenya wò nyuie wu ame bubu ɖe sia ɖe.
I don’t know anyone.	Nyemenya ame aɖeke o.

Thank you for any help.	Akpe na mi ɖe kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe ta.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anye nenema o.
But I don’t want to talk, just think about it	Gake nyemedi be maƒo nu o, bu eŋu kpɔ ko
I couldn’t stand it at all.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu kura o.
Morning and night.	Ŋdi kple zã me.
There’s a strong person in that	Ame sesẽ aɖe le ema me
I need to be aware of everything that is going on	Ele be manya nusianu si le edzi yim la nyuie
I couldn’t figure out what it was	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi wònye o
Which, of course, is pretty obvious.	Nusi, le nyateƒe me la, dze ƒã ŋutɔ.
I could barely stand it	Ƒã hafi mete ŋu nɔa te ɖe enu
I look forward to meeting with you tomorrow	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be mado go kpli mi etsɔ
I only found out a week ago.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka koe nye esia meva nya.
I have something to say.	Nya aɖe le asinye magblɔ.
They are just like that.	Ðeko wole nenema.
In fact, I did feel a bit	Le nyateƒe me la, mese le ɖokuinye me vie nyateƒe
I need to do something about that.	Ele be mawɔ nane tso ema ŋu.
I will go if you can manage it	Mayi ne àte ŋu akpɔ edzi
I can do it again.	Mate ŋu awɔe ake.
I wonder if that means anything	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe ema fia nane hã
An idea came to him	Susu aɖe va susu me nɛ
He can win the battle.	Ate ŋu aɖu dzi.
I was doing it all wrong	Menɔ wo katã wɔm le mɔ gbegblẽ nu
It can’t be better than that.	Mate ŋu anyo wu ema o.

Let me know how this works out for you.	Na manya ale si esia wɔa dɔ na wò.
He doesn’t need any more.	Mehiã bubu aɖeke o.
I didn’t know people could do that to each other	Nyemenya be amewo ate ŋu awɔ nu ma ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu o
It’s clear and effective.	Eƒe nu me kɔ eye wòwɔ dɔ nyuie.
It looks really good.	Edze nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.

There was no one inside.	Ame aɖeke menɔ eme o.
But he couldn’t see anything.	Gake mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
But you, fine.	Gake wò ya, nyuie.
No one does this.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa esia o.
I know things got a little out of hand	Menya be nuwo va do le asi me vie
It’s usually a bad time for everyone around me.	Zi geɖe la, ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ aɖee wònye na amesiame si dome mele.
You have two days now.	Ŋkeke eve le asiwò fifia.
I will probably be fine in the morning	Anye be manɔ nyuie le ŋdi me
I remember him being here	Meɖo ŋku edzi be ele afisia
There are better jobs out there.	Dɔ siwo nyo wu le afima.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I tried over and over again	Medze agbagba zi gbɔ zi geɖe
He has worked in many projects.	Ewɔ dɔ le dɔ geɖe me.
I was trying to talk	Menɔ agbagba dzem be maƒo nu
I just really like you	Ðeko wò nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
This takes a very long time.	Esia xɔa ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ.
But he himself.	Gake eya ŋutɔ.
I just wanted to live	Ðeko medi be manɔ agbe
I have to talk to you.	Ele nam be maƒo nu kpli wò.
I'm not sure what's wrong with me.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi le fu ɖem nam dzi o.
My first one wasn’t good enough for me.	Nye ame gbãtɔ menye ame nyui nam o.
Clearly, it is something more.	Edze ƒã be enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema.
Can’t say it’s amazing.	Mate ŋu agblɔ be ewɔ nuku o.
It’s just not ready.	Ðeko wòle klalo o.
This place couldn't be better.	Teƒe sia mate ŋu anyo wu ema o.
I can’t let that go	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le nya ma ŋu o
I hope you can find it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu ake ɖe eŋu.
We will need to be strategic about this.	Ahiã be míawɔ aɖaŋu le esia ŋu.
I know you can hear them	Menya be àte ŋu ase wo
These things are very important.	Nu siawo le vevie ŋutɔ.
It will take weeks, maybe months.	Axɔ kwasiɖa geɖe, ate ŋu axɔ ɣleti geɖe.
We don’t have time.	Ɣeyiɣi mele mía si o.
I touched it, just in case	Meka asi eŋu, nenye be edzɔ be nane dzɔ ɖe edzi ko
I can’t dismiss that idea	Nyemate ŋu agbe susu ma o
That’s just a great thing.	Ema nye nu gã aɖe ko.
I can’t do anything for him	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke nɛ o
I just thought it was awesome	Ðeko mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ
I would have seen you anywhere	Anye ne mekpɔ wò le afi sia afi hafi
I get on well with it.	Mewɔa nu nyuie kplii.
Put your time into it.	De wò ɣeyiɣi eme.
Tonight was a big moment.	Zã sia nye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe.
I had far more important things on my mind	Nu siwo le vevie wu kura la nɔ susu me nam
A victim of circumstance	Ame si nɔnɔme aɖe gblẽ nu le
I couldn’t face any of them	Nyemete ŋu dze ŋgɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o
The opposite side was more present.	Akpa si tsi tre ɖe eŋu la nɔ anyi wu.
It can happen.	Ate ŋu adzɔ.
I was happy for once in my life	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ zi ɖeka le nye agbe me
I didn’t expect him to	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be awɔe nenema o
Not just until now.	Menye vaseɖe fifia ko o.
Some of them are, some of them are not.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nye, wo dometɔ aɖewo mele nenema o.
They will do almost anything you want.	Woawɔ nusianu kloe si nèdi.
There is still much to do.	Nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.
I understand now, thanks	Mese egɔme fifia, akpe
We know what to do.	Míenya nusi míawɔ.
But how would he reach them from the wild.	Gake aleke wòawɔ aɖo wo gbɔ tso gbe me.
I had this problem once	Kuxi sia nɔ ŋunye zi ɖeka
Some were still very angry.	Ame aɖewo gakpɔtɔ nɔ dziku dom vevie.
I tried something different this time	Mete nu bubu aɖe kpɔ zi sia
I got this a while back.	Mexɔ esia ɣeyiɣi aɖe va yi.
I will go somewhere else	Mayi teƒe bubu aɖe
As if that were possible.	Abe ɖe ema anya wɔ ene.
I desperately need someone to talk to.	Mehiã ame aɖe si maƒo nu kplii vevie.
That might be a first for me.	Ema ate ŋu anye gbãtɔ nam.
Help with a new one.	Kpe ɖe yeye ŋu.
That seems right, somehow.	Edze abe nya ma sɔ ene, le mɔ aɖe nu.
I don’t know what that is.	Nyemenya nusi ema nye o.
He, who has received so much, has enough.	Eya, amesi xɔ nu geɖe alea la, ƒe nu sɔ gbɔ.
But his mind is focused.	Gake eƒe susu le teƒe ɖeka.
It is here, in my hand.	Ele afisia, le nye asi me.
I’ve already done it.	Mewɔe xoxo.
I was very nervous	Metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ
Not really anyway.	Menye le nyateƒe me o le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I heard you struggle before	Mese nèle avu wɔm do ŋgɔ
I had to call the police	Ele be maƒo ka na kpovitɔwo
I'm getting angry.	Mele dziku dom.
It’s never been a problem.	Menye kuxi aɖeke kpɔ o.
And we are here now.	Eye míele afisia fifia.
I should have done that	Ðe wòle be mawɔe nenema hafi
I was able to believe it well	Mete ŋu xɔ edzi se nyuie
This could not have actually happened.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ hafi o.
I'll save you.	Maɖe wò.
It has very few problems.	Kuxi ʋɛ aɖewo koe le eŋu.
Nothing can be done about it now.	Naneke meli woawɔ tso eŋu fifia o.
I had never heard of this guy	Nyemese ŋutsu sia ŋkɔ kpɔ o
I am looking forward to it	Mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie
But I encountered a problem.	Gake medo go kuxi aɖe.
I haven’t been able to find anyone about it yet	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ ame aɖeke tso eŋu haɖe o
We are moving forward.	Míele ŋgɔ yim.
Perhaps none of them are	Ðewohĩ wo dometɔ aɖeke mele nenema o
I have to look forward to that	Ele be makpɔ mɔ na ema
But it’s clearly not impossible.	Gake edze ƒã be menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I can hardly get rid of them myself	Nye ŋutɔ nyemate ŋu aɖe wo ɖa kura o
Now comes the fun part.	Azɔ akpa si doa dzidzɔ na ame la va ɖo.
This is going to cost a lot of money.	Esia le ga geɖe xɔ ge.
He's not quite like that anymore, you know.	Eya ŋutɔ hã megale nenema kura o, ènya.
I can't figure out what's wrong with you	Nyemate ŋu anya nusi le fu ɖem na wò o
I am looking forward to it!	Mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie!
There is no other word for it.	Nya bubu aɖeke meli na esia o.
And it’s all great.	Eye esia katã nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I was doing a good job	Menɔ dɔ nyui aɖe wɔm
I can’t live in this house with him	Nyemate ŋu anɔ aƒe sia me kplii o
It's not working well though.	Mele dɔ wɔm nyuie o ke hã.
Not much there.	Menye nu geɖe le afima o.
I’m the one who’s supposed to be here.	Nyee nye amesi wòle be manɔ afisia.
It was never like that.	Menɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
I also really liked the whole space inside	Teƒe bliboa si nɔ eme hã dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
I was looking forward to working with you	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm vevie be mawɔ dɔ kpli mi
I heard without ears and saw without eyes	Mese to manɔmee eye mekpɔ nu ŋku manɔmee
I didn’t know what to say to him	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ nɛ o
If you could, we’d all have it by now.	Ne àte ŋui la, anye ne ele mía katã si fifia.
I am the way, the truth, and the life	Nyee nye mɔ la, nyateƒe la kple agbe la
I don’t think anyone will remember	Nyemesusu be ame aɖeke aɖo ŋku edzi o
I knew everyone else would do the job	Menya be ame bubu ɖesiaɖe awɔ dɔa
I think this may be the issue.	Mesusu be esia ate ŋu anye nya la.
I doubt that’s a good thing	Meke ɖi be nu nyui aɖee nye ema
I tried to say something but nothing came	Medze agbagba be magblɔ nya aɖe gake naneke meva o
An idea came to him	Susu aɖe va susu me nɛ
Or he could have stolen them.	Alo ate ŋu afi wo hafi.
I know you’re tired	Menya be ɖeɖi te ŋuwò
I can’t say he was surprised	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ be ewɔ nuku nɛ o
It was weird, but I was interested	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ, gake metsɔ ɖe le eme
I think this will help you	Mesusu be esia akpe ɖe ŋuwò
I reached up and felt only my hair	Medo asi ɖe dzi eye nye ɖa koe mese le ɖokuinye me
It never makes any sense.	Susu aɖeke mele eme gbeɖe o.
I just just got convinced	Ðeko meva ka ɖe edzi ko
A year ago, I might have enjoyed that	Ƒe ɖeka enye sia la, ɖewohĩ ema ado dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
He didn’t want to work.	Medi be yeawɔ dɔ o.
And they’re going up.	Eye wole dzi yim.
But it still doesn't seem to be working.	Gake edze abe mele dɔ wɔm kokoko o ene.
It’s four to one.	Enye ene ɖe ɖeka.
I could have handled that.	Anye ne mate ŋu akpɔ nya ma gbɔ hafi.
Couldn't make this work.	Mete ŋu na esia nawɔ dɔ o.
I guess that was a little weird after that	Mesusu be ema wɔ nuku vie le ema megbe
He likes this kind of thing.	Nu sia ƒomevi dzɔa dzi nɛ.
It’s been two years since I fell in love with her.	Ƒe eve enye sia tso esime nye dzi va nɔ eŋu.
Now, more than ever.	Fifia, wu tsã.
I wasn’t behind this.	Menye nyee nɔ megbe na esia o.
Finally, someone did more than that.	Mlɔeba la, ame aɖe wɔ nu geɖe wu ema.
I came for a couple of reasons.	Meva susu eve aɖewo ta.
He must have time.	Ele be ɣeyiɣi nanɔ esi.
There was nothing here that could help them.	Naneke menɔ afisia si ate ŋu akpe ɖe wo ŋu o.
I am very sorry	Meɖe kuku vevie
And that’s a new thing.	Eye ema nye nu yeye.
I really enjoyed this book	Agbalẽ sia do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
There is one room inside	Xɔ ɖeka me le eme
I hope you enjoy it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be dzi adzɔ mi ŋutɔ.
You know the one.	Ènya ɖeka la.
It won’t be like that.	Manɔ nenema o.
I am sure of this.	Meka ɖe esia dzi.
I'm talking to this guy.	Mele nu ƒom na ŋutsu sia.
And he didn’t do that either.	Eye mewɔe nenema hã o.
I was ready this time.	Menɔ klalo zi sia.
We can go soon.	Míate ŋu ayi kpuie.
I had to fight them	Ele be mawɔ avu kpli wo
The reality of things.	Ale si nuwo le ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I just can’t live without her	Ðeko nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi eya manɔmee o
I am still doing this	Mele esia wɔm vaseɖe fifia
I’m not in a hurry.	Nyemele du dzi o.
Otherwise it is a rejection.	Ne menye nenema o la, enye gbegbe.
We will work with you in any way we can.	Míawɔ dɔ kpli mi le mɔ ɖesiaɖe si míate ŋui nu.
I never knew his name	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ o
Accordingly,.	Le esia nu la,...
I also did very well yesterday	Mewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ hã etsɔ
I just wanted to know what was going on there	Ðeko medi be manya nusi le edzi yim le afima
I also had my own horse	Nye ŋutɔ nye sɔ hã nɔ asinye
He tried several times without success.	Edze agbagba zi geɖe gake medze edzi o.
I could say more than that	Mate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe wu ema
I had too much on my mind	Nu geɖe nɔ susu me nam akpa
I haven’t heard anything about them.	Nyemese naneke tso wo ŋu o.
I never expected it to exist	Nyemekpɔ mɔ gbeɖe be anɔ anyi o
I remember hearing about that machine	Meɖo ŋku edzi be mese mɔ̃ ma ŋu nya
No one else seems to know much about it either.	Edze abe ame bubu aɖeke hã menya nu tso eŋu tututu o ene.
I’ve never felt it in my life	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me le nye agbe me kpɔ o
Like he’s actually doing that.	Abe ɖe wòle ema wɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
I’ve seen a lot, and I can help you	Mekpɔ nu geɖe, eye mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò
But this year is different.	Gake ƒe sia ya to vovo.
I knew almost nothing about it	Nyemenya naneke kloe tso eŋu o
That’s all for us today.	Ema koe nye na mí egbea.
Like the old days.	Abe tsã ene.
Today that situation is almost bleak.	Egbea nɔnɔme ma megale mɔ kpɔm na nu nyui aɖeke kloe o.
I have something to tell you	Nya aɖe le asinye magblɔ na mi
He can book it himself.	Eya ŋutɔ ate ŋu awɔ agbalẽ ɖe edzi.
A police car came down to the house	Kpovitɔwo ƒe ʋu aɖe ɖi va aƒea me
I have never wanted anyone more	Nyemedi ame aɖeke wu ema kpɔ o
It's in there with him.	Ele eme le afima kplii.
I wasn’t sure why he was being so angry	Nyemeka ɖe nusita wònɔ dziku dom alea gbegbe dzi o
Everyone else there died.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe si nɔ afi ma la ku.
I decided to have this job	Meɖoe be dɔ sia nanɔ asinye
And that wasn’t easy.	Eye nya ma menɔ bɔbɔe o.
I’ve done it before.	Mewɔe kpɔ.
I’ve seen his kind.	Mekpɔ eƒe ƒomevi la kpɔ.
It will probably come soon.	Anɔ eme be ava kpuie.
He is here somewhere.	Ele afisia le afi aɖe.
This is not required by law.	Esia mebia tso esi se la o.
I did this last year.	Mewɔ esia le ƒe si va yi me.
This town is so small.	Du sia le sue ale gbegbe.
I am looking forward to it very much.	Mele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie ŋutɔ.
However, the opposite is true.	Ke hã, nusi to vovo na emae nye nyateƒe.
I want to know these things	Medi be manya nu siawo
Getting there is one big challenge.	Afima ɖoɖo nye kuxi gã ɖeka.
And it worked for me.	Eye ewɔ dɔ nam.
I just don’t know.	Ðeko nyemenya o.
I knew he would	Menya be awɔe
I could barely open my eyes	Ƒã hafi mete ŋu ʋu ŋku
He didn’t seem to have any problems.	Edze abe kuxi aɖeke menɔ eŋu o ene.
I’ve taken care of it for you	Mekpɔ edzi na wò
Be a good idea.	Nye susu nyui aɖe.
They all happened.	Wo katã dzɔ.
I was hoping it would be you	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be wòe anye
I just don’t want to be alone	Ðeko nyemedi be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi o
Which is normal, for us.	Nusi sɔ, na mí.
It worked out very well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
It’s been a while.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
There are no rules and regulations.	Se kple ɖoɖo aɖeke meli o.
Now you know what to do.	Fifia ènya nusi nàwɔ.
I want it to work for you.	Medi be wòawɔ dɔ na wò.
And to do it myself.	Eye be nye ŋutɔ mawɔe.
Take care of it yourself.	Wò ŋutɔ kpɔ edzi.
I decided to do just that.	Meɖoe be mawɔ nu ma tututu.
That could be some time.	Ema ate ŋu anye ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
But there was one exception.	Gake ɖeka aɖe hã nɔ anyi si to vovo.
I stepped closer.	Meɖe afɔ ɖe eŋu wu.
Now here you are.	Azɔ wòe nye esi.
I finally got it in my mind	Meva nɔ susu me nam mlɔeba
I couldn’t wait to see what would happen.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ nusi ava dzɔ o.
It’s a huge challenge.	Enye kuxi gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
We can talk about something else.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu tso nu bubu aɖe ŋu.
The truth is so bad.	Nyateƒea gblẽ ale gbegbe.
I just can’t explain it all right now	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖe wo katã me fifia o
But that’s all part of it	Gake ema katã nye eƒe akpa aɖe
If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.	Ne ame aɖe si susu aɖe le la, taflatse na manya.
I am in good shape in life	Mele nɔnɔme nyui me le agbe me
But now mine anyway.	Gake fifia la, nye tɔ le go sia go me.
I know he is trying now	Menya be ele agbagba dzem fifia
I couldn’t have done it alone	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔe hafi o
That seems strange to me.	Ema dze abe ɖe mewɔ nuku nam ene.
I really don’t want to talk to anyone	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be maƒo nu kple ame aɖe o
Make him feel comfortable.	Na eƒe dzi dze eme.
He seems to be the only exception.	Edze abe eya koe mewɔe nenema o ene.
And his name offended him.	Eye eƒe ŋkɔ do dziku nɛ.
But apparently he could have.	Gake edze abe ate ŋu awɔe nenema hafi.
His voice was loud.	Eƒe gbe sesẽ.
It is a difficult situation.	Enye nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe.
We know what’s in our food.	Míenya nusi le míaƒe nuɖuɖu me.
I look forward to another year.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na ƒe bubu.
Nothing had a name.	Ŋkɔ menɔ naneke si o.
I need to focus on this	Ele be nye susu nanɔ esia ŋu
He never did that.	Mewɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
I had to come home soon after	Ele be mava aƒeme le ema megbe kpuie
It’s a pretty big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t remember it at all	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi kura o
Not that one.	Menye ɖeka ma o.
He might have been impressed.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi hafi.
I saw his face.	Mekpɔ eƒe mo.
We were very happy there.	Dzi dzɔ mí ŋutɔ le afima.
If anything else .	Ne nu bubu aɖe li la .
That obviously means something	Edze ƒã be ema fia nane
That doesn’t tell me much.	Ema megblɔ nya geɖe nam o.
But think about it.	Gake bu eŋu kpɔ.
I don’t mean to offend you	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mado dziku na wò o
Everything went very well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie ŋutɔ.
Honestly, I had nothing	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke menɔ asinye o
But that’s just my rule for me.	Gake nye se koe nye ema nam.
I was so close to my home	Mete ɖe nye aƒe ŋu ale gbegbe
I don’t know anyone at all	Nyemenya ame aɖeke kura o
Or any man either.	Alo ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe hã.

Exactly what is coming.	Nusi tututu gbɔna.
Find other people to work with.	Di ame bubu siwo nàwɔ dɔ kplii.
I can tell you it was a job	Mate ŋu agblɔ na mi be dɔ aɖee
In one aspect.	Le akpa ɖeka me.

He never said that.	Megblɔ nya ma kpɔ o.
I got a new book yesterday	Mexɔ agbalẽ yeye aɖe etsɔ
He’ll probably come looking for me with a gun.	Anɔ eme be etsɔ tu ava dim.

Cognitive.	Le susu me.

We have plenty of time for that.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe le mía si na ema.
I decided to let it go	Meɖoe be maɖe asi le eŋu
I was going to see you	Menɔ wò kpɔ ge
That’s the name of it.	Emae nye eƒe ŋkɔ.
I’m so glad you liked it	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be edzɔ dzi na wò
Really good stuff too.	Nu nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ hã.

Exactly what it is.	Nusi tututu wònye.
See what it can do for us.	Kpɔ nu si wòate ŋu awɔ na mí ɖa.
Keep going, keep going.	Yi edzi, yi edzi.
I had another great teacher	Nufiala gã bubu aɖe nɔ asinye
I will have it if I want it	Manɔ asinye ne medi
I saw you just like this	Mekpɔ wò alea tututu
I am ready to fight.	Mele klalo be mawɔ avu.
Clearly, that is possible.	Edze ƒã be ema ate ŋu adzɔ.
However, the reason for this is very simple.	Ke hã, susu si tae wòle alea ɖo la le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
But a problem began last week.	Gake kuxi aɖe dze egɔme le kwasiɖa si va yi me.
It didn’t make anything easy for me.	Mewɔ naneke bɔbɔe nam o.
Now, you might have times when you can’t do that.	Fifia, ɖewohĩ ɣeyiɣi aɖewo anɔ asiwò si me màte ŋu awɔ ema o.
It’s never too late to do good.	Metsi megbe gbeɖe be woawɔ nyui o.
Maybe find this place .	Ðewohĩ akpɔ teƒe sia .
Yet we cannot do without time.	Ke hã míate ŋu awɔ nu ɣeyiɣi manɔmee o.
That is impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Just a little something about them .	Nu sue aɖe ko si ku ɖe wo ŋu .
We can get over them at some point.	Míate ŋu aɖu wo dzi le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me.
Very difficult one.	Sesẽ ŋutɔ ɖeka.
I can't achieve that from the job though	Nyemate ŋu aɖo nu ma gbɔ tso dɔa me o gake
I never knew them.	Nyemenya wo kpɔ o.
What a dead man this is.	Ŋutsu kuku kae nye si.
I couldn’t feel more fulfilled.	Nyemate ŋu ase le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme wu ema o.
I never wanted or wanted to join them there	Nyemedi alo medi be mawɔ ɖeka kpli wo le afima gbeɖe o
I wanted them so badly	Medi wo vevie ale gbegbe
In fact, he is one of them.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
There is a time for hard work and a time for desire	Dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ ƒe ɣeyiɣi kple didi ƒe ɣeyiɣi li
I don’t want to do that to him	Nyemedi be mawɔ nu ma ɖe eŋu o
I have nothing to say to you	Nya aɖeke mele asinye magblɔ na mi o
I don’t know what it was like	Nyemenya ale si wònɔ o

Not nearly long enough.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi si sɔ gbɔ kloe o.

In the first configuration, this is not an issue.	Le ɖoɖo gbãtɔ me la, esia menye nya o.

I hope that’s not the outcome here.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be menye emae do tso eme le afisia o.

It will take us years and years to do that.	Axɔ ƒe geɖe kple ƒe geɖe hafi míate ŋu awɔ ema.
Maybe too long.	Ðewohĩ didi akpa.
I'm sure he doesn't remember her name.	Meka ɖe edzi be meɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi o.
But he had something.	Gake nane nɔ esi.

A dead man, but a man	Ŋutsu kuku aɖe, gake ŋutsu aɖe

However, that really doesn’t matter.	Ke hã, le nyateƒe me la, ema mehiã o.

I can always just get another job like my last one.	Ðeko mate ŋu akpɔ dɔ bubu abe nye mamlɛtɔ ene ɣesiaɣi.
We know what works for us.	Míenya nusi wɔa dɔ na mí.

I want that kid.	Medi ɖevi ma.
I never wanted to be here	Nyemedi be manɔ afisia gbeɖe o

That was enough for me the first time around	Ema sɔ gbɔ nam zi gbãtɔ si meva

I was angry with him and walked out	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu eye medo go
Please make arrangements.	Taflatse wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.

And now or never.	Eye fifia alo gbeɖe o.

It is not difficult at all.	Enye nusi sesẽ kura o.
There seems to be no help for this.	Edze abe kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke meli na esia ene.

I can’t tell you what’s right and what’s wrong	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nu si nyo kple nu si gblẽ la na wò o
Everything that appeals to him.	Nusianu si doa dzidzɔ nɛ.
I haven’t been able to get rid of them yet	Nyemete ŋu ɖe wo ɖa haɖe o
Not at all.	Menye nenema kura o.
But the words I lost were short.	Gake nya siwo bu nam la nɔ kpuie.
I want to move forward.	Medi be mayi ŋgɔ.
And you’re right there.	Eye èle afima tututu.
I used to work for him	Menɔ dɔ wɔm nɛ tsã

We can’t afford to eat much money.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ga geɖe aɖu o.

I gave them permission.	Meɖe mɔ na wo.

That’s a very good thing.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ.

I really can’t answer that right now.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu aɖo nya ma ŋu fifia o.

The search is over.	Didi la wu enu.

That’s why he couldn’t join us just yet.	Esia tae mete ŋu va kpe ɖe mía ŋu fifia ko o ɖo.

This place feels like home.	Teƒe sia se le eɖokui me abe aƒe ene.

Everything has a reason.	Susu aɖe le nusianu ŋu.

It’s not what they want.	Menye nusi dim wole o.
It’s the morning one.	Enye ŋdi me tɔ.
But there was one big problem.	Gake kuxi gã ɖeka aɖe nɔ anyi.
The car made a small amount of water.	Ʋua wɔ tsi sue aɖe.
It will help him.	Akpe ɖe eŋu.
However, we have good news for you.	Ke hã, nya nyui aɖe le mía si na mi.
Everything was going well.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie.
This sounds simple.	Esia ɖi nu bɔbɔe aɖe.
I can make a living on my own	Mate ŋu akpɔ agbe le ɖokuinye si

Some of these statements should be made under your full name.	Ele be nàgblɔ nya siawo dometɔ aɖewo le wò ŋkɔ bliboa te.
But he obviously didn’t.	Gake edze ƒã be mewɔe nenema o.
Or if something had happened to him.	Alo ne ɖe nane dzɔ ɖe edzi hafi.
I already knew who he was	Menya amesi wònye xoxo
I don’t think it will be.	Nyemesusu be anɔ nenema o.
I might have an idea who did this	Ðewohĩ susu aɖe anɔ asinye le amesi wɔ esia ŋu

And not for money.	Eye menye ɖe ga ta o.
I’ve never felt that way before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o

We can see the money we have.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ga si le mía si.
I didn’t want to go inside	Nyemedi be mayi ɖe eme o
But he is not a pushover.	Gake menye ame si ƒoa ame ɖe nu me o.
As a child, think about yourself.	Esi nènye ɖevi la, bu wò susu me na wò.
No time this morning.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli ŋdi sia o.
I just have to get on with my life	Ðeko wòle be mayi nye agbe dzi
He couldn’t see anything.	Mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
He had a gun in his hand.	Tu aɖe nɔ esi.
He was so clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ale gbegbe.
I think it surprised all of us	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku na mí katã
He tried to fight it.	Edze agbagba be yeawɔ avu kplii.
This is not surprising at all.	Esia mewɔ nuku kura o.
That just makes sense.	Susu le nya ma me ko.
This does the opposite.	Esia wɔa nusi to vovo na ema.
And when you are expected to behave in a certain way.	Eye ne wole mɔ kpɔm be nàwɔ nu le mɔ aɖe nu.
There is that, too.	Ema hã li.
But you can do anything or go anywhere you want.	Gake àte ŋu awɔ nu sia nu alo ayi afi sia afi si nèdi.
I don’t really know what to make of it	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso eŋu tututu o
He never reported.	Meka nya ta kpɔ o.
A kind of teacher.	Nufiala ƒomevi aɖe.
But there was definitely something to it.	Gake nane nɔ eme godoo be.
I thought that was beautiful too	Mesusu be ema hã nya kpɔ ŋutɔ
That’s really something.	Ema nye nane ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It is one thing within another.	Enye nu ɖeka le nu bubu me.
He didn’t know much about anything.	Menya nu boo aɖeke tso naneke ŋu o.
I saw no reason not to.	Mekpɔ susu aɖeke si tae mewɔe nenema o.
I have something else in mind	Nu bubu aɖe hã le susu me nam
It would be great there.	Anye nu gã aɖe le afima.
I can understand this.	Mate ŋu ase esia gɔme.
But deal with that.	Gake kpɔ ema gbɔ.
I have to work twice as hard today	Ele be mawɔ dɔ zi gbɔ zi eve egbea
There can only be one thing.	Nu ɖeka koe ate ŋu anye.
It’s a current problem.	Enye kuxi si li fifia.

You have to get along with people.	Ele be nàwɔ nu kple amewo nyuie.

It’s what you did.	Enye nusi nèwɔ.
I couldn’t marry anyone else	Nyemete ŋu ɖe ame bubu aɖeke o
It didn’t quite do the job.	Mewɔ dɔa tututu o.
He can do things no one else can.	Mete ŋu wɔa nu siwo ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ o.
I think this is a mistake.	Mesusu be vodada aɖee nye esia.
I don’t want this obviously.	Nyemedi esia dze ƒã o.
His voice was louder.	Eƒe gbe sesẽ wu.
I just don’t know where that could be	Ðeko nyemenya afisi ema ate ŋu anɔ o
I like you, too.	Wò hã dzɔa dzi nam.
I’m so glad I did that.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mewɔe nenema.
It worked well for me.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie nam.
I just didn’t realize what time it was	Ðeko nyemekpɔ ɣeyiɣi si me wòle la dze sii o
And he was tired of it.	Eye ɖeɖi te eŋu.
I am sure of that too	Meka ɖe edzi le ema hã ŋu
I had to try.	Ele be mate kpɔ.
I didn’t hear them all	Nyemese wo katã o
Not my whole self.	Menye nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye bliboa o.

Blood is a must.	Ʋu nye nusi wòle be woawɔ.
It’s just a little bit.	Enye nu sue aɖe ko.
I knew something was wrong	Menya be nane gblẽ
It was new to me in my life.	Enye nu yeye nam le nye agbe me.

We can still talk to them.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu na wo kokoko.

There is more to it as well.	Nu geɖe wu hã le eme.

I just wanted to do everything.	Ðeko medi be mawɔ nusianu.
It doesn’t really matter.	Mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I needed to do something about it	Ehiã be mawɔ nane tso eŋu
Someone was here.	Ame aɖe nɔ afisia.
I think he might have been interested too	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ eya hã tsɔ ɖe le eme tsã
I threw my hand away.	Metsɔ nye asi ƒu gbe.
I heard his voice.	Mese eƒe gbe.

There was definitely someone in that house.	Ame aɖe nɔ aƒe ma me godoo.
I will catch up with you soon	Mava ke ɖe ŋuwò kpuie
I can’t do that.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema o.

On any given day.	Le ŋkeke ɖesiaɖe dzi.

No one knows who you are or how you got here.	Ame aɖeke menya amesi nènye alo alesi nèwɔ va ɖo afisia o.
But this is different.	Gake esia to vovo.
I can work with him now	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ kplii fifia
This man is sick.	Ŋutsu sia dze dɔ.
Someone put the rope there.	Ame aɖe tsɔ ka la da ɖe afima.
Something you want to see.	Nane si nèdi be yeakpɔ.
I want every child to have that	Medi be ema nanɔ ɖevi ɖesiaɖe si
I was surprised when no one approached me	Mewɔ nuku nam esi ame aɖeke mete ɖe ŋunye o
I think a lot of people were like that	Mesusu be ame geɖe nɔ nenema
I made this very clear.	Megblɔ nya sia me kɔ ŋutɔ.
He was a money man.	Enye ga ŋutsu aɖe.
It was something he did himself.	Enye nusi eya ŋutɔ wɔ.
It’s worth it.	Edze na wo.
But that’s nothing.	Gake ema menye naneke o.
Everyone there had it.	Ame sia ame si nɔ afima la nɔ esi.
That’s what you need to do.	Emae nye nusi wòle be nàwɔ.
He couldn’t help it.	Mete ŋu kpe ɖe eŋu o.

But one problem though.	Gake kuxi ɖeka ya.
It’s another aspect.	Enye akpa bubu.
It was never like that, ever.	Menɔ nenema gbeɖe, kpɔ o.
I was very impressed with him	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
Stay away from it.	Te ɖa le eŋu.
I never quite understood what it was	Nyemese nusi wònye la gɔme tututu kpɔ o
I'll explain it to him	Maɖe eme nɛ
Talk to him about it.	Ƒo nu kplii.
I just really want to talk to you	Ðeko medi vevie be maƒo nu kpli wò

Get in, get in of course.	Ge ɖe eme, ge ɖe eme ya.

Impossible, for them.	Manya wɔ o, na wo.
That’s a whole different problem.	Ema nye kuxi si to vovo kura.
It doesn’t fit together.	Mewɔ ɖeka o.

This is often possible, but not always.	Zi geɖe la, esia ate ŋu adzɔ, gake menye ɣesiaɣi o.
Everything just felt right here.	Ðeko nusianu se le eɖokui me le afisia tututu.
But that backfired.	Gake ema va gblẽ nu le ame ŋu.

I think that’s pretty good	Mesusu be ema nyo ŋutɔ
I want to know what is going on	Medi be manya nu si le edzi yim
Almost everyone else seemed to do the same.	Edze abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe kloe hã wɔe nenema ke ene.
I couldn’t tell him what to do	Nyemete ŋu gblɔ nusi wòawɔ nɛ o
I didn’t hear anyone come inside	Nyemese ame aɖeke ge ɖe eme o
That depends entirely on him.	Ema nɔ te ɖe eya dzi kura.
That’s why you want me to.	Esia tae nèdi be mawɔe ɖo.
But this process takes a lot of time.	Gake dɔ sia wɔwɔ xɔa ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
I can’t do that to you anymore	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma ɖe ŋuwò azɔ o
I couldn’t tell anyone the truth	Nyemete ŋu gblɔ nyateƒea na ame aɖeke o
Now, take a deep breath.	Azɔ, gbɔ ya sesĩe.
I tried to tell him what had happened	Medze agbagba be magblɔ nu si dzɔ la nɛ
He had never done this before.	Mewɔ esia kpɔ o.
But he couldn’t help himself.	Gake mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe eɖokui nu o.

There are a lot of things you have to contend with.	Nu geɖe li siwo ŋu wòle be nàwɔ avu kplii.
But we’re not looking at your face.	Gake míele wò mo kpɔm o.

The right word.	Nya si sɔ.
The same is true between your tongue and the bottom of your mouth.	Nenema ke wòle le wò aɖe kple wò nu te dome hã.
It seems to be the case.	Edze abe ɖe wòle nenema ene.

He would like to go home.	Adi be yeayi aƒeme.
Tomorrow could be a tough day.	Etsɔ ate ŋu anye ŋkeke sesẽ aɖe.

And not just once.	Eye menye zi ɖeka ko o.
It didn’t bother me in a way.	Meɖe fu nam le mɔ aɖe nu o.

And the person behind that.	Eye ame si le ema megbe hã.

Maybe she could tell him everything that happened.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu aƒo nu tso nu sia nu si dzɔ ŋu nɛ.
I could have easily stayed there	Anye ne mate ŋu anɔ afima bɔbɔe hafi

I was the only weird guy out	Nye ɖeka koe nye ŋutsu si mewɔ nuku o si do go
I started to get bored	Meva nɔ fu ɖem nam
I have all these problems too	Kuxi siawo katã le nye hã ŋunye
If only he wanted to.	Nenye be eya koe di.
There has to be a plan	Ele be ɖoɖo aɖe nanɔ anyi
I didn’t like it at all.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu kura o.
That’s just one little thing.	Nu sue ɖeka koe nye ema.
This is much more appropriate.	Esia sɔ wu kura.
I wondered where he was now.	Mebia ɖokuinye be afikae wòle fifia hã.
I know exactly where this place is	Menya afisi tututu teƒe sia le
I just don’t know how	Ðeko nyemenya alesi mawɔe o
I am so worried about you	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò ale gbegbe
I really want to talk to you.	Medi be maƒo nu kpli wò ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He seems to be doing well.	Edze abe ele edzi dzem nyuie ene.
I can’t go there.	Nyemate ŋu ayi afima o.
The face went away.	Mo la dzo yi.
I think you will enjoy it	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò
I got here early.	Meɖo afisia kaba.
Not in this way.	Menye mɔ sia nu o.

I can’t deal with you	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu kpli wò o
You don’t have to do anything more.	Mehiã be nàwɔ naneke wu ema o.
Fall on it.	Dze anyi ɖe edzi.
I can’t give you all of them	Nyemate ŋu ana wo katã wò o
And that obviously won’t work.	Eye edze ƒã be ema mawɔ dɔ o.
Look, go through it.	Kpɔ ɖa, to eme.
It doesn’t matter.	Mele vevie o.
I never wanted to meet that man	Nyemedi gbeɖe be mado go ŋutsu ma o
But he couldn’t start any trouble.	Gake mete ŋu dze kuxi aɖeke gɔme o.
He couldn’t go today.	Mete ŋu yi egbea o.
That was too late, of course.	Ema tsi megbe akpa ya.
But I couldn’t help but feel something was wrong	Gake nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o, gake mese le ɖokuinye me be nane gblẽ
I wish it was just that.	Ne ɖe wòle nenema tututu la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
I don’t have a house of my own.	Nye ŋutɔ nye aƒe aɖeke meli o.
A good day's work.	Ŋkeke ƒe dɔ nyui aɖe.
It will take some time.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I deeply understand this.	Mese esia gɔme vevie.
Death, exactly that.	Ku, nenema tututu.
I had to do something.	Ele be mawɔ nane.
I don’t want to see you.	Nyemedi be makpɔ wò o.
In his own way.	Le eya ŋutɔ ƒe mɔ nu.
But you know the truth.	Gake ènya nyateƒea.
I was so happy to see them there	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ esi mekpɔ wo le afima
I know what you like	Menya nusi dzɔa dzi na wò
I know many of them	Menya wo dometɔ geɖe
But there was something that meant something.	Gake nane nɔ anyi si fia nane.
I think that’s pretty good	Mesusu be ema nyo ŋutɔ
A place that is not here.	Teƒe aɖe si mele afisia o.
I wasn’t planning on coming.	Menye ɖe menɔ ɖoɖo wɔm be mava o.
He didn’t intend it.	Meɖoe o.

I can’t stand it at all	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu kura o
I couldn’t look away	Nyemete ŋu ɖe ŋku ɖa o
There is a fine quality to his voice	Nɔnɔme nyui aɖe le eƒe gbe ŋu
I'm not sure what it is	Nyemeka ɖe nusi wònye dzi o
What do you want them to do?.	Nukae nèdi be woawɔ?.
Still, it worked.	Ke hã ewɔ dɔ.
There is no one else here.	Ame bubu aɖeke mele afisia o.
You can see just about anything.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusianu kloe.
In this case,.	Le go sia me la,...
A place like this is too good for me	Teƒe si le abe esia ene nyo nam akpa
No one could know what happened to him.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu nya nusi va dzɔ ɖe edzi o.
But that didn’t bother the police.	Gake ema meɖe fu na kpovitɔwo o.
However, we are also working on it.	Ke hã, míele dɔ wɔm ɖe eŋu hã.
I had everything	Nusianu nɔ asinye
I saw this in my own town	Mekpɔ esia le nye ŋutɔ nye du me
I had to do it for myself	Ele be mawɔe na ɖokuinye
The car accelerated.	Ʋua va nɔ du dzi sesĩe.
It was a difficult day.	Ŋkeke sesẽ aɖee wònye.
I was able to hold myself together	Mete ŋu lé ɖokuinye ɖe te
I heard, or felt	Mese, alo mese le ɖokuinye me
Name? 	Ŋkɔ?
And he’s never been there.	Eye meva afima kpɔ o.
I couldn’t hold them down for long	Nyemete ŋu te wo nu eteƒe didi o
I have tried many things and nothing has worked yet	Mete nu geɖe kpɔ eye naneke mewɔ dɔ haɖe o
I knew he was depressed	Menya be nu te ɖe edzi

I got to hold them all	Meva lé wo katã ɖe asi
His whole attention was on her.	Eƒe susu katã nɔ eŋu.
A problem may arise	Kuxi aɖe ate ŋu ado mo ɖa
You don’t have to do a thing for it.	Mehiã be nàwɔ nu aɖe na esia o.
I really had nowhere to go	Le nyateƒe me la, afi aɖeke menɔ asinye mayi o
I just can’t help you with this	Ðeko nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò le esia me o
You know that place.	Ènya teƒe ma.
A real person, not a character in a role	Ame ŋutɔŋutɔ, ke menye ame aɖe si le akpa aɖe wɔm o
I actually have a male name that fits him perfectly	Le nyateƒe me la, ŋutsu ŋkɔ aɖe le asinye si sɔ nyuie nɛ
It’s obvious.	Edze ƒã.
That something can be anything.	Be nane ate ŋu anye nusianu.
I was alone in my room	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ nye xɔ me
I was just surprised.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku nam.
This is difficult for everyone.	Esia sesẽ na amesiame.
Our city is better than this.	Míaƒe du la nyo wu esia.
I should know better than to try by now.	Ele be manya nyuie wu be mate kpɔ vaseɖe fifia.
In years past there have been few.	Le ƒe siwo va yi me la, ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe li.
I just wanted to know about it	Ðeko medi be manya nu tso eŋu
I heard his mind tell me	Mese eƒe susu gblɔ nam
I think he would really enjoy them.	Mesusu be akpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe wo ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I hope he stays after that	Mele mɔ kpɔm be anɔ anyi le ema megbe
I wasn’t going to let it go	Menye ɖe meɖoe be maɖe asi le eŋu o
People are gathering.	Amewo le ƒu ƒom.
He had plenty of food and water.	Nuɖuɖu kple tsi geɖe nɔ esi.
This takes a lot of time.	Esia xɔa ɣeyiɣi geɖe.
I will come on my own	Mava le ɖokuinye si
That was our year.	Emae nye míaƒe ƒe.
This is so much more.	Esia sɔ gbɔ ale gbegbe.
I thought to myself, this can’t be true.	Megblɔ le ɖokuinye me be, esia mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
It doesn’t seem to be clear to them.	Edze abe menye nusi me kɔ na wo o ene.
Make an appointment with us.	Wɔ ɖoɖo kpli mí.
I only gave you the first part.	Akpa gbãtɔ koe metsɔ na wò.
I hope it does come	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ava nyateƒe
I got something for you.	Mexɔ nane na wò.
I knew I wasn’t waiting	Menya be mele lalam o
I can’t really tell what it is	Nyemate ŋu anya nusi tututu wònye o
It must have been some time.	Anɔ eme be ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
In fact, it makes sense.	Le nyateƒe me la, susu le eme.
He can do it now.	Ate ŋu awɔe fifia.
I don't know what happened to him.	Nyemenya nusi va dzɔ ɖe edzi o.
We don’t know what to do now.	Míenya nusi míawɔ fifia o.
What to do.	Nusi woawɔ.
I’m happy about that	Edzɔ dzi nam ɖe nya ma ŋu
His jaw wasn’t working properly.	Eƒe aɖu menɔ dɔ wɔm nyuie o.
The police were obviously concerned too.	Edze ƒã be kpovitɔwo hã tsi dzi ɖe eŋu.
I will translate in real time	Maɖe egɔme le ɣeyiɣi ŋutɔŋutɔ me
I can't seem to call him and.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu aƒo ka nɛ o eye...
I had given things up completely	Meɖe asi le nuwo ŋu kura kpɔ
I felt satisfied	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme
In this case, it was me.	Le go sia me la, nyee.
He can refuse well.	Ate ŋu agbe nyuie.
I tried to fight though	Medze agbagba be mawɔ avu gake
We can do something about that.	Míate ŋu awɔ nane tso ema ŋu.
I was so interested in it.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme ale gbegbe.
I hardly had time to go out	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye kura be mado go o

A few of them are not working at all	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo megale dɔ wɔm kura o

I was also very angry	Menɔ dziku dom vevie hã
I was surprised when I walked inside	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ esi meva ge ɖe eme
A lie is a lie is a lie	Alakpa nye alakpa nye alakpa
And two of those.	Eye eve le ema me.
The present paper, however, does.	Gake agbalẽ si li fifia ya ya wɔe nenema.
I stepped back and fell in love with her	Meɖe afɔ ɖe megbe eye eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
No one knows what it is.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi wònye o.
I don’t want to be anywhere else.	Nyemedi be manɔ teƒe bubu aɖeke o.
Everyone has to do their own thing	Ele be amesiame nawɔ eya ŋutɔ ƒe dɔ
Once.	Zi ɖeka.
All of you.	Mi katã.
It’s a very complicated thing.	Enye nusi me kɔ ŋutɔ.
Someone is looking for you.	Ame aɖe le wò dim.
It’s a waste of time and money.	Enye ɣeyiɣi kple ga gbegblẽ.
There is no one like him.	Ame aɖeke meli si sɔ kplii o.
I can’t go out without them	Nyemate ŋu ado go wo manɔmee o
I was very confident in myself	Meka ɖe ɖokuinye dzi ŋutɔ
I’m only here for you	Wò ta koe meva afisia ɖo
He would never have wanted to know that.	Anye ne madi gbeɖe be manya esia o.
I have a very good reputation	Ŋkɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ le asinye
I can’t make him do that	Nyemate ŋu ana wòawɔ nu ma o
I don’t trust people	Nyemeka ɖe amewo dzi o
This last factor is very important.	Nu mamlɛtɔ sia le vevie ŋutɔ.
I don’t want anything to do with you	Nyemedi be mawɔ naneke kpli wò o
And something else, something else.	Eye nu bubu aɖe, nu bubu aɖe hã.
I actually look forward to going to work	Le nyateƒe me la, mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be mayi dɔme
I have another opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ bubu aɖe le asinye.
I need to do a better job	Ele be mawɔ dɔ si nyo wu
I fought it the whole way	Mewɔ avu kplii le mɔ bliboa dzi
I know people for whom this is easy	Menya ame siwo esia le bɔbɔe na
I understood too well	Mese egɔme nyuie akpa
That is totally impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ kura o.
That surprised us.	Ema wɔ nuku na mí.
You know or booze or something.	Ènya alo aha sesẽ alo nane.
He fled the scene.	Esi dzo.
I can only hope it is	Ðeko mate ŋu akpɔ mɔ be ele nenema
I couldn’t help myself.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe ɖokuinye nu o.
They are waiting for you.	Wole lalam na wò.
That’s a good shot.	Ema nye tu nyui aɖe.
This year it will be no different.	Le ƒe sia me la, manɔ nenema kura o.
I tried to fight it.	Medze agbagba be mawɔ avu kplii.
Other possibilities are not.	Nu bubu siwo ate ŋu adzɔ la mele nenema o.
I was almost on my own.	Menɔ ɖokuinye si kloe.
We are where we are.	Míele afisi míele.
I had nothing today	Naneke menɔ asinye egbea o
I didn’t feel anything about it	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be naneke mele eŋu o
He is with them now.	Ele wo gbɔ fifia.
It was a big deal.	Nya gã aɖee wònye.
My dog ​​is the only one at home.	Nye avu ɖeka koe le aƒeme.
None of them are obvious.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke medze ƒã o.
He didn’t try too hard.	Medze agbagba vevie akpa o.
Yet, his attitude seems to have changed.	Ke hã edze abe eƒe nɔnɔme trɔ ene.
Nothing is worth it.	Naneke medze o.
And it worked too well	Eye ewɔ dɔ nyuie akpa
This is a good one.	Esia nyo.
It can take a very long time.	Ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ.
This way is better.	Mɔ sia nyo wu.
I don’t want to bother you	Nyemedi be maɖe fu na wò o

I am sure this is correct	Meka ɖe edzi be nya sia sɔ
Not by any means.	Menye to mɔ aɖeke dzi o.
There was another tax here.	Adzɔ bubu aɖe hã nɔ afisia.
We’re in a really tense situation right now.	Míele nɔnɔme si me dzo le ŋutɔŋutɔ me fifia.
I can’t let this be done to you	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ woawɔ nu sia ɖe ŋuwò o
I think it is the case.	Mesusu be ele nenema.
Nothing made sense.	Susu menɔ naneke me o.
I don’t know exactly where they are.	Nyemenya afi si tututu wole o.
What a sight.	Nya kae nye si.
But he had been troubled by two issues in the past.	Gake nya eve aɖewo ɖe fu nɛ va yi.
He has his meeting.	Eƒe kpekpea le esi.
It was a great shot for me.	Enye tu gã aɖe nam.
I’m not sure what they’re going to do, but it’s real	Nyemeka ɖe nusi woawɔ dzi o, gake enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ
Thank you very much.	Akpe na wò ŋutɔ.

It is the opposite.	Enye nusi to vovo na ema.
Fuck them so hard.	Fu wo sesĩe ale gbegbe.

I resisted the urge to give up	Metsi tre ɖe didi si nɔ menye be maɖe asi le nu ŋu la ŋu
He didn’t know where he was.	Menya afi si wòle o.
Some people won’t.	Ame aɖewo mawɔe o.
Every city needs something like this.	Du ɖesiaɖe hiã nane si le abe esia ene.
There are two main reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo li siwo tae wòle be woawɔ esia ɖo wu.
I did, but not anymore	Mewɔe, gake megale nenema o
That’s hard to work with.	Ema sesẽ be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
I know you’re doing something.	Menya be èle nane wɔm.
This is as simple as it gets.	Esia le bɔbɔe abe alesi wòle bɔbɔe ene.
Always.	Ɣesiaɣi.
But these times.	Gake ɣeyiɣi siawo.
We have no idea how much that will be.	Míenya alesi gbegbe ema anye o.
I can depend on that	Mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe ema dzi
But it’s in my head	Gake ele nye ta me
I tried to concentrate, but it wasn’t easy	Medze agbagba be nye susu nanɔ nu la ŋu, gake menɔ bɔbɔe o
I tested you in your own home	Medo wò kpɔ le wò ŋutɔ wò aƒe me
I can get home alone	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu aɖo aƒeme
This is not surprising for several reasons.	Esia mewɔ nuku o le susu geɖe ta.
It has happened before.	Edzɔ kpɔ do ŋgɔ.
I was just surprised that we were going to the same school	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku nam be míele suku ɖeka ma ke me yim
This innovation of his own mind.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe susu me nu yeye sia.
I could never live with that	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe ɖe ema nu gbeɖe o
I could see his complexity	Mete ŋu kpɔa eƒe nɔnɔme si me kɔ nyuie la
You just want to keep going.	Ðeko nèdi be yeayi edzi.
I really don’t understand why it doesn’t work.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemese nusita mewɔa dɔ o gɔme o.

Look, he likes it.	Kpɔ ɖa, eƒe nu doa dzidzɔ nɛ.

I think that would be a good idea	Mesusu be ema anye susu nyui aɖe
Yet he didn’t do that.	Ke hã mewɔe nenema o.

Still, we’re in better shape than last year.	Ke hã, míele nɔnɔme nyui me wu ƒe si va yi tɔ.

The opposite of that.	Nusi to vovo na ema.
Good job, man.	Dɔ nyui aɖee, ame.
I think that’s bad	Mesusu be ema gblẽ
And maybe something better will come of it.	Eye ɖewohĩ nane si nyo wu ado tso eme.
His dog got there.	Eƒe avu la va ɖo afima.
I did tell you so much	Megblɔ nya geɖe ŋutɔ na wò nyateƒe
He didn’t do them any harm.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke na wo o.

They have a role to play in this.	Akpa aɖe le wo si woawɔ le esia me.

The first time was only about a month ago.	Anɔ abe ɣleti ɖeka koe nye esia zi gbãtɔ si mewɔe ene.
In the end, it worked.	Mlɔeba la, ewɔ dɔ.

That seems reasonable.	Nya ma dze abe susu le eme ene.
It’s nothing to me.	Menye naneke nam o.
You can argue this yourself.	Wò ŋutɔ hã àte ŋu aƒo nya ɖe nya sia nu.
I wish there was someone who could help me	Medi be ame aɖe nanɔ anyi si ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye
We have that now more than ever.	Ema le mía si fifia wu tsã.
I can understand that	Mate ŋu ase nya ma gɔme
They’re really seeing that.	Wole ema kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I hope he feels the same way about me	Mele mɔ kpɔm be eya hã ase le eɖokui me nenema ke ɖe ŋunye
Some are still here.	Ame aɖewo gakpɔtɔ le afisia.
I don’t know anything else.	Nyemenya nu bubu aɖeke o.
The time of the.	Ɣeyiɣi si nye.
For this guy, the same.	Le ŋutsu sia ta la, nenema ke.
They are very active.	Wole dɔ dzi vevie ŋutɔ.
One of them died.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka ku.
I really shouldn't have much trouble	Le nyateƒe me la, mele be kuxi geɖe nanɔ ŋunye o
He lost his heart.	Dzi bu le eŋu.
I lived with him for years	Menɔ anyi kplii ƒe geɖe
Just a few hours.	Gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
This is a house.	Aƒe aɖee nye esia.
I had all these problems	Kuxi siawo katã nɔ ŋunye
Short.	Kpuie.
There is no one.	Ame aɖeke meli o.
He still didn’t answer.	Meɖo nya aɖeke ŋu kokoko o.
I will need to take care of people	Ahiã be makpɔ amewo gbɔ
And so it is.	Eye nenema ke.
I want out of this place	Medi be mado le teƒe sia
Which shouldn’t surprise us.	Nusi mele be wòawɔ nuku na mí o.
I wondered if he was doing the afternoon shift	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe wònɔ ŋdɔ me dɔa wɔm hã
Both head and heart are engaged	Ta kple dzi siaa do ŋugbe na wo nɔewo
Nothing else will work.	Nu bubu aɖeke mawɔ dɔ o.
He seemed to have lost a little air	Edze abe ya vi aɖe do le eme ene
And something had to be done.	Eye ele be woawɔ nane.
A shot rang out in the background	Tu aɖe ɖi le megbe
I have to make my own rule	Ele be mawɔ nye ŋutɔ nye se
But they are all the same .	Gake wo katã wole ɖeka .
I don’t know much about it	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o
That way, we can talk about everything together.	To mɔ sia dzi la, míate ŋu aƒo nu tso nusianu ŋu ɖekae.
. . . .	.
Several.	Geɖe.
I am able to do something differently.	Mete ŋu wɔa nane le mɔ bubu nu.
I don’t know what to do with it.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ kplii o.
I think he's starting to	Mesusu be ele egɔme dzem
But he was seriously ill.	Gake edze dɔ vevie.
Maybe it was someone else.	Ðewohĩ ame bubu aɖee.
I have to live one day at a time	Ele be manɔ agbe ŋkeke ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me
I can do that too.	Nye hã mate ŋu awɔ ema.
But he did do one thing.	Gake ewɔ nu ɖeka ya.
What he can do that might help.	Nusi wòate ŋu awɔ si ɖewohĩ akpe ɖe eŋu.
Not many people can live to say that.	Ame geɖe mate ŋu anɔ agbe agblɔ nya ma o.
I want you, and you are the only one	Medi wò, eye wò ɖeka koe
I finally found this place, my home.	Meva ke ɖe teƒe sia ŋu mlɔeba, si nye nye aƒe.
Now it’s a strategy.	Fifia enye aɖaŋu aɖe.
He wouldn’t fight for anything.	Mawɔ avu ɖe naneke ta o.
I was surprised by the empty house	Aƒe si me ame aɖeke mele o la wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
I know about these things	Menya nu tso nu siawo ŋu
I know what’s in it	Menya nusi le eme
It could take weeks, months.	Ate ŋu axɔ kwasiɖa geɖe, ɣleti geɖe.
Let me try this in a different way.	Mina mate esia kpɔ le mɔ bubu nu.
I expect the same here	Mekpɔ mɔ nenema ke le afisia hã
It could be a good thing!.	Ate ŋu anye nu nyui aɖe!.
No one had ever been there.	Ame aɖeke meva afima kpɔ o.
I did a lot of booking tonight	Mewɔ agbalẽ geɖe le zã sia me
I wonder if that is true	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe nya ma nye nyateƒe hã
I like that better, actually	Ema dzɔa dzi nam wu, le nyateƒe me
I also knew it would come tonight	Menya hã be ava le zã sia me
I liked him better	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam wu
I was fine after that	Menɔ nyuie le ema megbe
We don’t know how to control them.	Míenya alesi míawɔ aɖu wo dzi o.
I apologize for that.	Meɖe kuku ɖe ema ta.
I asked to speak with you.	Mebia be maƒo nu kpli wò.
Sit down there.	Nɔ anyi ɖe afima.
Thank you for the truth!!!!!!.	Akpe na mi ɖe nyateƒea ta!!!!!!.
I had to try.	Ele be mate kpɔ.
So is everyone else.	Nenema ke ame sia ame hã le.
You can still do it now.	Àte ŋu awɔe fifia kokoko.
Get out of his house.	Do go le eƒe aƒeme.
I could have given up.	Anye ne mate ŋu ana ta hafi.
I’ve never seen them before	Nyemekpɔ wo kpɔ o
I let them go.	Meɖe asi le wo ŋu.
I can walk him from behind	Mate ŋu azɔ edzi tso megbe
This way it is working very well.	Mɔ sia dzi wòle dɔ wɔm nyuie ŋutɔ.
I can’t stand it here	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi le afisia o
He'll need help tomorrow.	Ahiã kpekpeɖeŋu etsɔ.
It will probably be more itself tomorrow.	Anɔ eme be eya ŋutɔ anye geɖe wu etsɔ.
Problematic in that there is so much.	Kuxi le mɔ sia nu be nu geɖe ŋutɔ li.
Which is the truth.	Nusi nye nyateƒe.
I have a very good thing for him too	Nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ le asinye na eya hã
I don’t know his name or care	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ alo tsɔ ɖeke le eme o
I don’t want to go to my room	Nyemedi be mayi nye xɔ me o
I’ve kind of seen it and struggled with it before	Mekpɔ eƒe ƒomevi eye mewɔ avu kplii do ŋgɔ
Help me out quickly.	Kpe ɖe ŋunye kaba.
I’ve never felt that way before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o
I needed someone to tell me what to do	Mehiã ame aɖe si agblɔ nusi mawɔ nam
I wasn’t sure what he was waiting for	Nyemeka ɖe nusi wònɔ lalam dzi o
Here was another man who could guard her.	Ŋutsu bubu aɖe hã nɔ afisia si ate ŋu adzɔ eŋu.
I told him it was too soon	Megblɔ nɛ be ewɔ kaba akpa
He has nothing left.	Naneke megale esi o.
That’s always been interesting.	Ema nye nusi dzɔa dzi na ame ɣesiaɣi.
I kept my mind on it	Metsɔ nye susu yi edzi
The opposite is true.	Nusi to vovo na emae nye nyateƒea.
That man saved me.	Ŋutsu ma xɔ nam.
And he felt the same way.	Eye eya hã se le eɖokui me nenema ke.
I know he never said anything to her	Menya be megblɔ nya aɖeke nɛ kpɔ o
I couldn’t seem to get that clear in my mind.	Edze abe nyemete ŋu se nya ma me kɔ le nye susu me o ene.
I don’t know anything at all	Nyemenya naneke kura o
And there are quite a few for whom he will do that.	Eye ame ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ li siwo wòawɔ ema na.
I have a good idea about it	Susu nyui aɖe le asinye le eŋu
I am interested in many things	Metsɔ ɖe le nu geɖe me
But today is different.	Gake egbea ya to vovo.
I'd love for anyone else to join now.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ne ame bubu aɖe va ge ɖe eme fifia.
However, his voice did not improve.	Ke hã, eƒe gbe meva nyo ɖe edzi o.
I have seen this myself	Nye ŋutɔ mekpɔ esia
I wasn’t going to let it go.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be maɖe asi le eŋu o.
I was the only one who listened.	Nye ɖeka koe ɖo to.
That was such a beautiful one.	Ema nye esi nya kpɔ ale gbegbe.
This is easy to do.	Esia wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe.
I know what it is now.	Menya nusi wònye fifia.
His life was ruined.	Eƒe agbe gblẽ.
But you, be careful.	Gake wò ya kpɔ nyuie.
It just doesn’t work.	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ o.
I told him what a hard job it was	Megblɔ dɔ sesẽ si wònye la nɛ
I understand and my heart goes out to you	Mese egɔme eye nye dzi do dziku na wò
A place where anything and everything is instead	Teƒe si nusianu kple nusianu le ɖe eteƒe
I had to talk myself out of it in order to move forward.	Ele be maƒo ɖokuinye nu hafi ate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ.
I was also having some serious problems at home	Kuxi sesẽ aɖewo nɔ fu ɖem nam le aƒeme hã
I became more comfortable with myself	Meva nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm le ɖokuinye me wu
I had never been that close	Nyemete ɖe eŋu nenema gbegbe kpɔ o
That is a very good thing.	Ema nye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t go up there.	Mete ŋu yi dzi le afima o.
Stay here now.	Nɔ afisia fifia.
I told him what you did yesterday	Megblɔ nu si nèwɔ etsɔ la nɛ
I just couldn’t help myself after that	Ðeko nyemete ŋu kpe ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu le ema megbe o
Money made things possible.	Ga na nuwo te ŋu dzɔ.
But this is a mistake.	Gake esia nye vodada.
Or a week ago.	Alo kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia.
I'm not really sure what that really means.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi tututu ema fia dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
You can see the point here.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nya la le afisia.
Everyone talked about it all night.	Amesiame ƒo nu tso eŋu le zã bliboa me.
A few stayed behind, but not many	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo tsi megbe, gake menye ame geɖe o
That works well too.	Ema hã wɔa dɔ nyuie.
Have a nice night.	Zã nyui aɖe na mi.
You are not who you are.	Menye wòe nye amesi ƒomevi nènye o.
I would do anything for him	Mawɔ nusianu nɛ
A dress is not going to kill you	Awu aɖe mele wò wu ge o
Hold them together.	Lé wo ɖe teƒe ɖeka.
It’s really, really good for us.	Enye nu nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ na mí.
Any man would do it.	Ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe awɔe.
Honestly, no one bothered me.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame aɖeke meɖe fu nam o.
I wasn’t sure what to say or think	Nyemeka ɖe nya si magblɔ alo susu dzi o
I will sit down and talk to them	Manɔ anyi aƒo nu kpli wo
There seems to be a hole in my heart.	Edze abe do aɖe le nye dzi me ene.
Life goes on, you know.	Agbe yi edzi, ènya.
I want that for myself	Medi ema na ɖokuinye
I'm a little busy just now	Vovo mele ŋunye vie fifia ko
It’s pretty amazing though.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ gake.
I tried to get out of the house	Medze agbagba be mado le aƒea me
I think this could be exactly what you’re looking for.	Mesusu be esia ate ŋu anye nusi tututu dim nèle.
I think we should treat him well	Mesusu be ele be míawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu nyuie
However, there are still many problems with this.	Ke hã, kuxi geɖe gakpɔtɔ li le esia ŋu.
I fell backwards with it	Medze anyi ɖe megbe kplii
Everything seems fine here.	Edze abe nusianu nyo le afisia ene.
But no one did that.	Gake ame aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
It will do whatever you want.	Awɔ nusianu si nèdi.
Tell us how we are doing.	Gblɔ ale si míele la na mí.
It’s too soon for you.	Ewɔ kaba akpa na wò.
I told him that it was.	Megblɔ nɛ be ele nenema.
I am an interested person	Menye ame aɖe si tsɔ ɖe le eme
At least two weeks.	Kwasiɖa eve ya teti.
He didn't want to get too close.	Medi be yeate ɖe eŋu akpa o.
Or about me.	Alo ku ɖe ŋunye.
An hour and I’m sorry.	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka eye meɖe kuku.
He wasn’t looking for someone.	Menye ɖe wònɔ ame aɖe dim o.
We can	Míate ŋui .
But he liked it.	Gake edzɔ dzi nɛ.
I felt he had done this before.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ewɔ esia va yi.
I was only a few feet behind him	Afɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe menɔ megbe nɛ
But I really wanted to know	Gake medi vevie be manya
I was very interested to know	Metsɔ ɖe le eme ŋutɔ be manya
I stayed there for a year	Menɔ afima ƒe ɖeka
I wish he was right	Medi be eƒe nya le eteƒe
I was nervous, very nervous	Metsi dzodzodzoe, metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ
But he never worked out what it was.	Gake mewɔ dɔ tso nusi wònye ŋu kpɔ o.
I couldn’t decide to go inside.	Nyemete ŋu tso nya me be mayi ɖe eme o.
I fought to keep mine	Mewɔ avu be nye tɔ nanɔ te ɖe enu
I decided to get on board	Meɖoe be mava ɖo ʋua me
There weren’t many people.	Ame geɖe menɔ anyi o.
It’s really important.	Le vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I still have a mortgage	Aƒe ƒe fe aɖe gakpɔtɔ le asinye
I just wanted to see what was on them	Ðeko medi be makpɔ nusi le wo dzi
Just for a summer, you know.	Dzomeŋɔli aɖe ko ta la, ènya.
This is a great book.	Esia nye agbalẽ gã aɖe.
It’s just kind of weird.	Ðeko wònye nusi mewɔ nuku o ƒomevi aɖe.
He is speaking loudly now.	Ele nu ƒom sesĩe fifia.
I can talk about it.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu tso eŋu.
Yet there is more to it.	Ke hã nu geɖe le eme.
I had to do that over and over again	Ele be mawɔ ema zi gbɔ zi geɖe
Write, write, write.	Ŋlɔ, ŋlɔ, ŋlɔ nu.
He wouldn’t have a child either.	Vi manɔ eŋu hã o.
I did have help	Kpekpeɖeŋu nɔ asinye ya
I also like the everyday atmosphere	Gbe sia gbe ƒe nɔnɔme hã dzɔa dzi nam
I wasn’t going to do it	Menye ɖe mele ewɔ ge o
I gave that away	Metsɔ ema na
But this isn’t necessarily a bad thing or a dead end.	Gake menye nu gbegblẽ alo mɔ kuku aɖee esia nye kokoko o.
What works in one situation won’t necessarily work for another.	Nusi wɔa dɔ le nɔnɔme aɖe me mawɔ dɔ na bubu kokoko o.
And that’s a big problem.	Eye esia nye kuxi gã aɖe.
None of us knew what would be our last day.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke menya ŋkeke si anye míaƒe ŋkeke mamlɛtɔ o.
I have made my point.	Megblɔ nye nya la.
I felt like my voice was covered in dust	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ɖe ke ƒo nye gbe ene
This won’t be the case much longer.	Esia manɔ nenema ɣeyiɣi didi wu ema o.
As soon as one man goes, another comes.	Ne ŋutsu ɖeka nya yi ko la, bubu hã va.
He cannot win with them.	Mate ŋu aɖu dzi kpli wo o.
We are doing something good.	Míele nu nyui aɖe wɔm.

More confident, too.	Ka ɖe edzi wu, eya hã.

And we are there.	Eye míele afima.
I’m glad you can relate with it	Edzɔ dzi nam be àte ŋu ase nu gɔme kplii
I couldn’t have gotten there without you	Nyemate ŋu aɖo afima wò manɔmee o
It’s easy for me.	Ele bɔbɔe nam.
It was summer inside.	Dzomeŋɔli nɔ eme.
It shouldn’t matter	Mele be manɔ vevie o
But it is not at all.	Gake menye nenema kura o.
But he wasn’t sure.	Gake meka ɖe edzi o.
Or somewhere else, maybe.	Alo teƒe bubu aɖe, ɖewohĩ.
I think we can do that	Mesusu be míate ŋu awɔ ema
How is that true today?.	Aleke nya ma nye nyateƒe egbea?.
He didn’t plan it properly.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu nyuie o.
I couldn’t answer	Nyemete ŋu ɖo eŋu o
Thank you again.	Akpe na wò ake.
I haven’t heard from him in a while	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia nyemese nya aɖeke tso eŋu o
Everyone was very happy with the end result!.	Amesiame kpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ɖe nusi do tso eme mlɔeba ŋu!.
I can’t do that here	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema le afisia o
You could have done whatever you wanted.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu sia nu si nèdi hafi.
He did it for her with great thought.	Etsɔ susu gã aɖe wɔe nɛ.
Many of us have done that.	Mía dometɔ geɖe wɔe nenema.
I am not planning to go with them.	Menye ɖe mele ɖoɖo wɔm be mayi kpli wo o.
The voice in his mind seemed not his own at all.	Gbe si nɔ eƒe susu me la dze abe menye eya ŋutɔ tɔ kura o ene.
That is not a mistake.	Ema menye vodada o.
It was very impressive	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
Just a gun or a small ammunition.	Tu alo tu sue aɖe ko.
I just had to go to relax	Ðeko wòle be mayi be maɖe dzi ɖi
There has to be someone to stand up to them.	Ele be ame aɖe nanɔ anyi si anɔ te ɖe wo nu.
I don’t understand the logic either.	Nye hã nyemese susu si le eme la gɔme o.
I didn’t expect it, really	Nyemekpɔ mɔ nɛ o, le nyateƒe me
Thank you, all of you.	Akpe na mi, mi katã.
Any help out there?.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖe li le afima?.
He couldn’t be on his own.	Mete ŋu le eɖokui si o.
I used to be really worried about that too	Tsã la, nye hã metsi dzi ɖe ema ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ
But how can we understand this if.	Gake aleke míawɔ ase esia gɔme ne.
He must have time.	Ele be ɣeyiɣi nanɔ esi.
I didn’t expect that.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na ema o.
But I had to go.	Gake ele nam be mayi.
It is a form of money.	Enye ga ƒomevi aɖe.
I was nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe.
I am not important.	Nyemele vevie o.
It just might save your life.	Ðeko wòate ŋu aɖe wò agbe.

You can do it, too.	Wò hã àte ŋui.
Think about it better.	Bu eŋu nyuie wu.
You have to do something.	Ele be nàwɔ nane.

I am helping out.	Mele kpekpeɖeŋu nam.
I’ve never seen much of anyone	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke ƒe nu geɖe kpɔ o
If there is no smoke, there will be no fire.	Ne dzudzɔ aɖeke meli o la, dzo manɔ anyi o.
There was more to it than this, of course.	Nu geɖe nɔ eme wu esia ya.
Everyone deserves to die.	Amesiame dze na ku.
Life isn’t like that.	Agbe mele nenema o.
I really didn’t want to go with him	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be mayi kplii o
I wasn’t sure what to do	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ dzi o
I would be happy for that	Adzɔ dzi nam ɖe ema ta
But he was very tired.	Gake ɖeɖi te eŋu ŋutɔ.
I need to be able to protect myself	Ele be mate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye ta
Not just between each other.	Menye le wo nɔewo dome ko o.

And everyone can play a role.	Eye amesiame ate ŋu awɔ akpa aɖe.
I need you for everything	Mehiã wò na nusianu
Every year is different.	Ƒe sia ƒe to vovo.
Not like it used to be.	Menye abe tsã ene o.
I knew something had happened to him	Menya be nane dzɔ ɖe edzi
I understand that now.	Mese nya ma gɔme azɔ.
I expected something a little more dramatic, actually	Mekpɔ mɔ na nane si wɔ nuku vie wu, le nyateƒe me
I became angry.	Meva do dziku.
And one of these men is a king.	Eye ŋutsu siawo dometɔ ɖeka nye fia.
I understand it better now than when I was a kid	Mese egɔme nyuie fifia wu esime menye ɖevi sue
The result would have been the same.	Anye ne nusi ado tso eme anɔ nenema ke.
I have to have respect	Ele be bubu nanɔ asinye
He had no children.	Vi aɖeke menɔ esi o.
I was the same way.	Nye hã menɔ nenema.
I don’t know the time or care	Nyemenya ɣeyiɣi alo tsɔ ɖe le eme o
I glanced at him	Meɖe ŋku ɖe eŋu
Not in his mind at least.	Menye le eƒe susu me ya teti o.
I like your work.	Wò dɔa dze ŋunye.
I tried facials but nothing worked	Mete kpɔ be woawɔ mo na ame gake naneke medze edzi o
However it has two major problems.	Ke hã kuxi gã eve le eŋu.

I actually enjoyed it a lot.	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
He hadn’t saved her.	Mexɔ nɛ hafi o.

There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eŋu o.
I’m glad I played a small part in it.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mewɔ akpa sue aɖe le eme.

You can give them any name you want.	Àte ŋu ana ŋkɔ ɖe sia ɖe si nèdi la wo.
He didn’t see anything.	Mekpɔ naneke o.

There is no law to prove what he did.	Se aɖeke meɖo kpe nusi wòwɔ dzi o.

This lasted too long.	Esia nɔ ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.

I couldn’t turn around	Nyemete ŋu trɔ megbe o
I think that’s true	Mesusu be nya ma nye nyateƒe
I’m sure you’re the man for the job.	Meka ɖe edzi be wòe nye ŋutsu si le dɔa ta.

The room threw him out too.	Xɔa me tsɔ eya hã ƒu gbe.
That is and is his way.	Emae nye eƒe mɔ eye wòle nenema hã.

However, the opposite is true.	Ke hã, nusi to vovo kura na emae.
In fact, he was surprised too.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ nuku nɛ hã.
You can see the other episodes so far here.	Àte ŋu akpɔ akpa bubu siwo li vaseɖe fifia le afisia.
I’m glad he’s happy.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ele dzidzɔ kpɔm.

But there was a bullet in his face.	Gake tu aɖe nɔ eƒe mo.
I stood firm.	Metsi tre sesĩe.
I could have and should have done something	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔ nane hafi eye ele be mawɔe hã hafi
I was actually a little nervous	Le nyateƒe me la, metsi dzodzodzoe vie
He never told anyone his real name.	Megblɔ eƒe ŋkɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ na ame aɖeke kpɔ o.
That’s all over.	Ema katã wu enu.
I think it’s a good point in a way	Mesusu be enye nya nyui aɖe le mɔ aɖe nu
I never saw them together	Nyemekpɔ wo ɖekae kpɔ o
They will make a mistake.	Woawɔ vodada.
I know this myself	Nye ŋutɔ menya esia
There is no other part.	Akpa bubu aɖeke meli o.
I got a little bit of everything here	Mexɔ nusianu ƒe vi aɖe le afisia
Not sure what to make of that.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi woawɔ tso ema ŋu dzi o.
This is the opposite.	Esia nye nya si tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
However, you don’t know the whole truth.	Ke hã, mènya nyateƒe bliboa o.
But I will tell you this	Gake magblɔ nya sia na mi
I tried to tell myself everything was fine	Medze agbagba be magblɔ na ɖokuinye be nusianu le nyuie
There is no one.	Ame aɖeke meli o.
Who is he?.	Amekae nye eya?.
I wasn’t very impressed	Mewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye boo o
Not with her, anyway.	Menye kplii o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I did, easily.	Mewɔe, bɔbɔe.
He had to fight it.	Ele nɛ be wòawɔ avu kplii.
I could feel but couldn’t analyze exactly what	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me gake nyemete ŋu ku nu me le nusi tututu ŋu o
I don’t know what else to do.	Nyemenya nu bubu si mawɔ o.
I’m so glad to be here with you	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mele afisia kpli wò
Honestly, it was a waste of time.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ aɖee wònye.
We can make blood, but we can’t make bones.	Míate ŋu awɔ ʋu, gake míate ŋu awɔ ƒu o.
But something was missing.	Gake nane bu.
Need help with the same.	Hiã kpekpeɖeŋu le nenema ke.
I planned just one	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ɖeka ko ŋu
Only once did I hear a voice	Zi ɖeka koe mese gbe aɖe
I was going to answer them now.	Menɔ wo ŋu ɖo ge azɔ.
I knew something had happened	Menya be nane dzɔ
He seemed to like this.	Edze abe esia dzɔ dzi nɛ ene.
It was someone else.	Ame bubu aɖee.
This has passed him by.	Esia to eŋu kpɔ.
I know what this is all about	Menya nusi ŋu nya sia katã ku ɖo
I made a promise myself at that point	Nye ŋutɔ medo ŋugbe le ɣeyiɣi ma me
They had a room.	Xɔ aɖe nɔ wo si.
I needed something to do	Mehiã nane si mawɔ
I could have been anywhere doing something	Anye ne mate ŋu anɔ afi sia afi anɔ nane wɔm hafi
I had no idea you were there	Nyemenya kura be èle afima o
Without anyone’s help.	Ame aɖeke ƒe kpekpeɖeŋu manɔmee.
There was a kind of familiarity.	Amewo nya nyuie ƒomevi aɖe nɔ anyi.
I never saw people.	Nyemekpɔ amewo kpɔ o.
Life in us, life in our city.	Agbe le mía me, agbe le míaƒe du me.
The result was the same.	Nusi do tso eme hã nye nu ɖeka.
He tried once.	Edze agbagba zi ɖeka.
Who we are to each other.	Ame siwo míenye na mía nɔewo.
I can do this job for you	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ sia na wò
There is no need to hurry.	Mehiã be woawɔ kaba o.
After all, this place is not ours at all.	Le nyateƒe me la, teƒe sia menye mía tɔ kura o.
He would never want that.	Madi nenema gbeɖe o.
That didn’t last long.	Ema menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
It fits that perfectly.	Ewɔ ɖeka kple nya ma nyuie.
I just don’t know any other way	Ðeko nyemenya mɔ bubu aɖeke o
I think it will do that.	Mesusu be awɔe nenema.
Come and win.	Va ɖu dzi.
He is one of us.	Mía dometɔ ɖekae wònye.
I can’t call him	Nyemate ŋu aƒo ka nɛ o
Maybe he died too.	Ðewohĩ eya hã ku.
And look where he is.	Eye kpɔ afisi wòle ɖa.
I think that’s amazing.	Mesusu be esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Time after time.	Ɣeyiɣi yi ɣeyiɣi.
I have to get you out of your house	Ele nam be maɖe wò le wò aƒeme
I'm sure he was tired	Meka ɖe edzi be ɖeɖi te eŋu
And since .	Eye esi wònye be .
Which one is better for you?.	Wo dometɔ kae nyo na wò?.
I think it would be easier.	Mesusu be anɔ bɔbɔe wu.
It’s the job.	Enye dɔa.
I had to let myself go out.	Ele be maɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu be mado go.
I, too, wonder to myself.	Nye hã, mebiaa ɖokuinye be.
This can’t be life.	Esia mate ŋu anye agbe o.
I had never heard of them.	Nyemese wo ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
Somehow he liked that.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, ema dze eŋu.
It's really something so far.	Enye nane ŋutɔŋutɔ vaseɖe fifia.
It’s just a little bit.	Enye nu sue aɖe ko.
I probably do the same thing myself	Anɔ eme be nye ŋutɔ hã mewɔa nu ma ke
I witnessed what it was like	Mekpɔ alesi wònɔ la teƒe
A scenario by no means impossible	Nɔnɔme si menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ kura o
Thank you for nothing.	Akpe na wò ɖe naneke ta o.
Understand my loss.	Se nye nusi bu la gɔme.
This is true, but only up to a point.	Esia nye nyateƒe, gake vaseɖe afi aɖe.
I can’t call you either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu aƒo ka na wò o
One of them was in bad shape.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka nɔ nɔnɔme gbegblẽ me.
Think about this.	Bu esia ŋu.
On his first day.	Le eƒe ŋkeke gbãtɔ dzi.
I get my work done in an hour.	Mewɔa nye dɔa le gaƒoƒo ɖeka me.
I was able to talk to him for hours	Mete ŋu ƒo nu kplii gaƒoƒo geɖe
I should have been the one protecting you	Ðe wòle be nyee nye ame si le ta kpɔm na wò hafi
Someone finally found us, after all these years.	Ame aɖe va ke ɖe mía ŋu mlɔeba, le ƒe siawo katã megbe.
I heard that yesterday	Mese nenema etsɔ
He had never felt that way in his life.	Mese le eɖokui me nenema le eƒe agbe me kpɔ o.
He would have seen nothing.	Anye ne mekpɔ naneke o.
I will tell you what to say	Magblɔ nya si nàgblɔ la na wò
I certainly am.	Mele nenema godoo.
Not at this time.	Menye le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
I remember the first day here	Meɖo ŋku ŋkeke gbãtɔ dzi le afisia
But I should have had a point	Gake ɖe wòle be nya aɖe nanɔ asinye hafi
No one has ever done this before.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ esia kpɔ o.
Keep up the great work.	Wɔ dɔ gã la yi edzi.
I just need a little time.	Ðeko mehiã ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe.
It made sense, somehow.	Susu nɔ eme, le mɔ aɖe nu.
Anyone, any age.	Ame sia ame, ƒe ɖesiaɖe.
I had to work quickly	Ele be mawɔ dɔ kaba
But that was just one of the things he did.	Gake nu siwo wòwɔ la dometɔ ɖeka koe nye ema.
I gave him something	Metsɔ nane nɛ
I felt very awkward out there	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nyemele vovo kura le afima o
He could have played any of them.	Ate ŋu aƒo wo dometɔ aɖe hafi.
You can’t be in it.	Màte ŋu anɔ eme o.
I know what’s best for you	Menya nusi anyo na wò
Now, the police have taken the lead.	Fifia, kpovitɔwo xɔ ŋgɔ.
I just can never remember.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi gbeɖe o.
Please do the following.	Taflatse wɔ nu siwo gbɔna.
I was right behind them and did the same	Menɔ wo megbe tututu eye mewɔ nenema ke
There is plenty of room to work with it.	Teƒe geɖe li woawɔ dɔ kplii.
I hope to see you soon	Mele mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ wò kpuie
He was quite a man in his own right.	Enye ŋutsu aɖe ŋutɔ le eɖokui si.
It’s very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
No one could understand it.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu se egɔme o.
In two parts.	Le akpa eve me.
They are in this situation.	Wole nɔnɔme sia me.
I lived a good life	Menɔ agbe nyui
I really don’t want this.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi esia o.
There’s just nothing there.	Ðeko naneke mele afima o.
That was a surprise to us.	Ema wɔ nuku na mí ŋutɔ.
I was thrilled.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ.
Start with your strong hand.	Dze egɔme kple wò asi sesẽ la.
I hoped my own hand was dry	Mekpɔ mɔ be nye ŋutɔ nye asi ƒu
Take a little break.	Gbɔ ɖe eme vie.
I knew what to expect	Menya nusi makpɔ mɔ na
I want one.	Medi ɖeka.
This is not one of them.	Esia menye wo dometɔ ɖeka o.
I want us all to work well together	Medi be mí katã míawɔ dɔ ɖekae nyuie
I asked myself the very same question	Mebia nya ma ke ŋutɔ ɖokuinye
I can get on board with that.	Mate ŋu aɖo ʋua me kple ema.
This moment is beautiful.	Ɣeyiɣi sia nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
He seemed to be following some kind of plan.	Edze abe ɖe wòle ɖoɖo aɖe ƒomevi dzi wɔm ene.
You are new here.	Ènye ame yeye le afisia.
I’m not so sure about it	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o

It’s not respectable.	Menye bubu le eŋu o.
I felt completely alone in that place	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye ɖeka koe le teƒe ma kura
I may be home soon.	Ðewohĩ mava aƒeme kpuie.
I got one right here	Mexɔ ɖeka le afisia tututu
He could have been dead, he wouldn’t have cared	Mate ŋu anye ame kuku hafi, anye ne metsɔ ɖeke le eme o
The man with the gun left here.	Ŋutsu si si tu le la dzo le afisia.
I never seemed to be able to do anything right	Edze abe nyemete ŋu wɔa naneke nyuie gbeɖe o ene
I’ve never seen one before.	Nyemekpɔ ɖeka kpɔ o.
I was in a private room	Menɔ xɔ aɖe si me ame aɖeke mele o me
I can’t help you	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò o
A job that no one else wants	Dɔ si ame bubu aɖeke medi o
I need to see the inside of your head	Ele be makpɔ wò ta ƒe akpa si le eme
There was no one ahead of him.	Ame aɖeke menɔ ŋgɔ nɛ o.
Years may pass.	Ƒe geɖe ate ŋu ava yi.
I know they are working on this	Menya be wole dɔ wɔm tso esia ŋu
I had to live with it, and he did	Ele nam be manɔ agbe ɖe enu, eye eya hã wɔe nenema
I had no house or apartment	Aƒe alo xɔ aɖeke menɔ asinye o
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
You know they’re here.	Ènya be wole afisia.
This is not an easy matter	Esia menye nya bɔbɔe o
I don’t want to go on living without you.	Nyemedi be mayi edzi anɔ agbe wò manɔmee o.
I don’t understand how things get normal either	Nye hã nyemese alesi nuwo va nɔa nɔnɔme nyui me gɔme o
I have something else on my side	Nu bubu aɖe hã le asinye le nye akpa dzi
This has been the case for a long time.	Esia le alea ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I hope it doesn’t bother him	Mele mɔ kpɔm be maɖe fu nɛ o
It will happen to us.	Adzɔ ɖe mía dzi.

This is probably appropriate.	Anɔ eme be esia sɔ.
Everything is just the way it is.	Nusianu le abe alesi wòle ene ko.
I felt water on my face	Mese tsi aɖe le mo nam
Do your part in something that really matters.	Wɔ wò akpa aɖe le nane si le vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ me.
Start any new project with an open mind.	Dze dɔ yeye ɖesiaɖe gɔme kple susu si ʋu.
I needed something strong right then and there	Mehiã nane sesẽ aɖe le ɣeyiɣi ma tututu me

Hands and heart.	Asi kple dzi.
You need to focus on the task at hand.	Ele be wò susu nanɔ dɔ si le asiwò la ŋu.
Thanks in advance for any help.	Akpe na mi do ŋgɔ ɖe kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe ta.

It would be great if someone could help you.	Anyo ŋutɔ ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I can’t really relate to it	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ɖeka kplii le nyateƒe me o

You can get food from it.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nuɖuɖu tso eme.

That didn’t work.	Ema mewɔ dɔ o.

And there are many about.	Eye wo dometɔ geɖe li ku ɖe.
No one will come between us.	Ame aɖeke mava mía dome o.

People who don’t always impress him.	Ame siwo mewɔa dɔ ɖe edzi ɣesiaɣi o.
I know there are people there	Menya be amewo le afima

But he was just one man.	Gake ŋutsu ɖeka koe wònye.

You never know.	Mènya gbeɖe o.
Real jobs that have disappeared.	Dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ siwo bu.

I just took a chance and it worked out well	Ðeko metsɔ mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe eye wòwɔ dɔ nyuie
And his face, too.	Eye eƒe mo hã.
There was one small problem.	Kuxi sue ɖeka aɖe nɔ anyi.
Like him, he was already educated.	Abe eya ene la, eya hã de suku xoxo.
Way too extreme.	Mɔ si gbɔ eme akpa.
But too often one is like another.	Gake zi geɖe akpa la, ɖeka nɔa abe bubu ene.

All of these people were very impressive.	Ame siawo katã wɔ dɔ ɖe edzi ŋutɔ.

I couldn’t hear anything different at all	Nyemete ŋu se nya aɖeke si to vovo kura o
That’s ours.	Ema nye mía tɔ.

I think that’s pretty good.	Mesusu be nya ma nyo ŋutɔ.
Fire away, ask whatever you want.	Dzo ɖa, bia nusianu si nèdi.
It is more important than ever.	Ele vevie wu tsã.

In his mind.	Le eƒe susu me.

I think he enjoyed that	Mesusu be ema do dzidzɔ nɛ
That will appeal to you, too.	Ema hã adzɔ dzi na wò.
I see nothing wrong with that.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si gblẽ le ema ŋu o.

It’s not really true.	Menye nyateƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.

Maybe for us.	Ðewohĩ na mí.
Every aspect of it.	Eƒe akpa sia akpa.
He knew nothing better.	Menya naneke si nyo wu ema o.
All in one night.	Wo katã le zã ɖeka me.
We all know someone who did this.	Mí katã míenya ame aɖe si wɔ esia.

But this doesn’t work.	Gake esia mewɔa dɔ o.
I can do that with or without help	Mate ŋu awɔ ema ne kpe ɖe ŋunye alo kpekpeɖeŋu manɔmee
It wasn’t what he expected.	Menye nusi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na ye o.
But it’s not just a city.	Gake menye du aɖe koe o.
I still have that book.	Agbalẽ ma gakpɔtɔ le asinye.
He couldn't tell how many there were.	Mete ŋu nya wo dometɔ nenie nɔ anyi o.
This is a great opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖee nye esia.
He did nothing besides that.	Mewɔ naneke tsɔ kpe ɖe ema ŋu o.
It seems clear to us that it is.	Edze abe eme kɔ na mí be ele nenema ene.
Not to do you any favors.	Menye be woawɔ nyui aɖeke na wò o.

I just wanted to be with him	Ðeko medi be manɔ anyi kplii
That can’t be a good thing.	Ema mate ŋu anye nu nyui aɖeke o.
His face was hot.	Eƒe mo xɔ dzo.
I did it all the time as a kid	Mewɔa esia ɣesiaɣi esime menye ɖevi
I could have at least given him a try.	Anye ne mate ŋu ana wòate kpɔ ya teti hafi.
I know what’s best for me	Menya nusi anyo nam

Not like our first one.	Menye abe míaƒe gbãtɔ ene o.

A few things happened beyond his control	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo dzɔ siwo dzi mate ŋu aɖu o
Yet the truth is firm.	Ke hã nyateƒea li ke.

And it will be amazing.	Eye awɔ nuku ŋutɔ.

I would emphasize that point.	Mate gbe ɖe nya ma dzi.
Everything went clear.	Nusianu yi edzi kɔ nyuie.

He couldn’t find it.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.

I couldn’t figure out what it was like	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nɔnɔme si me wòle o
So many hours.	Gaƒoƒo geɖe ale gbegbe.

Through many things.	To nu geɖe dzi.
I am convinced of that	Meka ɖe edzi le nya ma ŋu
I never saw anyone else	Nyemekpɔ ame bubu aɖeke kpɔ o
I quickly left that house	Mewɔ kaba dzo le aƒe ma me
Ya la ku.	Ya la ku.

I replied to him like this	Meɖo eŋu nɛ alea
But there are some problems with it.	Gake kuxi aɖewo le eŋu.
I can't.	Nye mate ŋui o.
I don’t want to be there.	Nyemedi be manɔ afima o.
I looked there, and I panicked	Mekpɔ afima, eye metsi dzodzodzoe
I could hear his voice	Mete ŋu se eƒe gbe
Too many years.	Ƒe geɖe akpa.
I know my own name, kid	Menya nye ŋutɔ nye ŋkɔ, ɖevi
In your home.	Le wò aƒeme.
It didn’t take me long to figure out what this place was all about.	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi hafi va nya nusi teƒe sia nye o.
I couldn’t do it.	Nyemete ŋu wɔe o.
The dignity of life.	Bubu si le agbe ŋu.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
I was finally able to speak	Mete ŋu ƒo nu mlɔeba
I worked harder than any of them	Mewɔ dɔ sesĩe wu wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe
He is doing the right thing.	Ele nu nyui wɔm.
People will be coming home from school now.	Amewo ava tso suku fifia.
Everything was amazing.	Nusianu wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This one doesn’t do that.	Esia mewɔa esia o.
He had a reason.	Susu aɖe nɔ esi.
But that task will not be easy.	Gake dɔ ma manɔ bɔbɔe o.
It kind of makes sense, actually.	Susu le eme le mɔ aɖe nu, le nyateƒe me.
I can’t promise you anything	Nyemate ŋu ado naneke ƒe ŋugbe na wò o
It’s a different role.	Enye akpa si to vovo.
Consider some of them.	Bu wo dometɔ aɖewo ŋu kpɔ.
But this morning let me just say this.	Gake ŋdi sia na magblɔ nya sia ko.
I always interact with people from home	Mewɔa nu kple ame siwo tso aƒeme ɣesiaɣi
But he wasn’t happy at all.	Gake mekpɔ dzidzɔ kura o.

But, it is not working.	Gake, mele dɔ wɔm o.
A lot of things happened.	Nu geɖe dzɔ.
No one knows where you are.	Ame aɖeke menya afisi nèle o.

It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.

This would be just as good.	Esia hã anyo nenema ke.

People are seeing a completely different side to us.	Amewo le akpa bubu kura kpɔm na mí.
I am heartbroken, and death is upon me.	Dzi bu le ŋunye, eye ku le dzinye.
And that’s what’s really important here.	Eye emae nye nusi le vevie ŋutɔ le afisia.
This is not a big deal.	Esia menye nya gã aɖeke o.

I was very worried.	Metsi dzi vevie.
I can easily do this job for you	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ sia na wò bɔbɔe
I am ready for this .	Mele klalo na esia .
However not for long.	Ke hã menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
But it looks like him.	Gake edze abe eya ene.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
Somehow he liked it.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, edzɔ dzi nɛ.
I have to talk to me	Ele be maƒo nu na nye
This is a good thing.	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe.
On the one hand, it is a small town.	Le go ɖeka me la, du sue aɖee wònye.
You hope they’re doing something wrong.	Èle mɔ kpɔm be wole nu gbegblẽ wɔm.
Pay them well, give them a good life.	Fe na wo nyuie, na agbe nyui nanɔ wo si.
I need some help.	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo.
It is no longer the case.	Megale nenema o.
There was another room.	Xɔ bubu aɖe hã nɔ eme.
I have some issues of my own	Nye ŋutɔ nye nya aɖewo le asinye
It didn’t surprise me too much	Mewɔ nuku nam akpa o
I want to meet them once that says this	Medi be mado go wo zi ɖeka si gblɔ nya sia
Trust us on this.	Ka ɖe mía dzi le esia ŋu.
I fell for him.	Medze anyi ɖe eŋu.
We are a part of each other.	Míenye mía nɔewo ƒe akpa aɖe.
I want to know what happened to me	Medi be manya nusi dzɔ ɖe dzinye
I would like to say the following.	Madi be magblɔ nya siwo gbɔna.
The nature of the object.	Nusi ƒe nɔnɔme.
Want me to talk to you now.	Di be maƒo nu kpli wò fifia.
However, maybe not you or me.	Ke hã, ɖewohĩ menye wò alo nyee o.
One to create an opportunity.	Ame ɖeka si awɔ mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe.
It could not have been real.	Mate ŋu anye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ hafi o.
Great, now backtrack.	Gã, azɔ trɔ ɖe megbe.
This post is neither short nor short.	Nya sia mele kpuie o eye menye kpuie hã o.
I have survived so much in my life.	Metsi agbe le nu geɖe ŋutɔ me le nye agbe me.
It really started	Edze egɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ
This is a fantastic idea.	Esia nye susu aɖe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I was very interested in that	Metsɔ ɖe le nya ma me ŋutɔ
I didn’t see you there either	Nye hã nyemekpɔ wò le afima o
With regard to this arrangement.	Le ɖoɖo sia ŋu.
We can’t be like that.	Míate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
He put his gun back.	Etsɔ eƒe tu la da ɖe megbe.
But in reality, this is not the case.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, esia mele nenema o.
Nothing else did.	Nu bubu aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
We are doing everything we can.	Míele nusianu si míate ŋui wɔm.
I can’t answer that.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo nya ma ŋu o.
Otherwise, you may catch fire.	Ne menye nenema o la, àte ŋu axɔ dzo.
It was a shock to me	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
Perhaps, it will be as impressive as the gun.	Ðewohĩ, awɔ nuku na ame abe tu la ene.
I needed to get out of here	Ehiã be mado le afisia
I think something happened between them before	Mesusu be nane dzɔ le wo dome do ŋgɔ
I understand them.	Mese wo gɔme.
Everything went so well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie ale gbegbe.
He didn’t say that.	Megblɔ nya ma o.
Solve one problem.	Kpɔ kuxi ɖeka gbɔ.
That’s another lie.	Ema nye alakpa bubu.
That was very bad.	Ema gblẽ nu ŋutɔ.
You can almost literally hope	Àte ŋu akpɔ mɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ kloe
His head was wet.	Eƒe ta ƒu tsi.
Our child has grown in many ways.	Mía vi la tsi le mɔ geɖe nu.
Lots of bad stuff.	Nu gbegblẽ geɖe.
Come one, come all.	Va ɖeka, va katã.
All of it, all of it is beautiful.	Wo katã, wo katã nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
I saw and felt nothing.	Mekpɔ naneke eye nyemese le ɖokuinye me o.
I got one, you know	Mexɔ ɖeka, ènya
That seems to be what they are doing.	Edze abe nu ma wɔm wole ene.
I would be living without you	Anye be manɔ agbe wò manɔmee
A little bit, it was impressive	Vi aɖe la, ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ
Or anything else.	Alo nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
You can do it, too.	Àte ŋu awɔe hã.
Nothing ever came out of nothing.	Naneke medo tso naneke me kpɔ o.
I have nothing else to do.	Naneke megale asinye mawɔ o.
Otherwise, we are definitely going to lose money.	Ne menye nenema o la, míele ga bu ge godoo.
However, he never said anything.	Ke hã, megblɔ nya aɖeke kpɔ o.
I put everything on my side	Meɖo nusianu ɖe ​​nye akpa dzi
I am so happy to have a good job	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be dɔ nyui aɖe le asinye
I know you are a busy man	Menya be ènye ŋutsu si ŋu vovo mele o
We’ve been at this for a long time.	Míele esia me ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
But I would like to see you in the morning	Gake madi be makpɔ wò le ŋdi me
These people are still working.	Ame siawo gakpɔtɔ le dɔ wɔm.
I have to see what happens	Ele be makpɔ nusi adzɔ
I made the mistake of telling him the truth	Mewɔ vodada be megblɔ nyateƒea nɛ
I wanted what was best for him.	Medi nusi anyo nɛ wu.
I took the time to blow dry my hair	Mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi tsɔ ya ƒo nye ɖa
This is a very good life	Agbe nyui aɖe ŋutɔ esia
But this doesn’t seem to have worked.	Gake edze abe esia mewɔ dɔ o ene.
Make that one.	Wɔ ɖeka ma.
Not for long, anyway.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
Here, no problems arose.	Le afisia la, kuxi aɖeke medo mo ɖa o.
I needed to talk to him	Ehiã be maƒo nu kplii
There just isn’t much there.	Ðeko nu geɖe mele afima o.
It’s easy, actually.	Ele bɔbɔe, le nyateƒe me.
It surprised me, too	Ewɔ nuku nam hã
Many people left.	Ame geɖe dzo.
I know exactly what happened	Menya nusi tututu dzɔ
I can’t imagine myself anywhere else	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye le susu me le teƒe bubu aɖeke o
I don’t mean to be mad at you	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mado dziku ɖe ŋuwò o
I have to apologize from the bottom of my heart	Ele be maɖe kuku tso dzi me
Find someone to find.	Di ame aɖe ɖa.
I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that.	Meka ɖe edzi be naneke mele eme o.
It was kind of weird.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku ƒomevi aɖe.
Everyone is so good at it.	Amesiame nyo le eme ale gbegbe.
I can’t just let it go.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu ko o.
It doesn’t make any shape.	Mewɔa nɔnɔme aɖeke o.
We could never stay there.	Míate ŋu anɔ anyi le afima gbeɖe o.
I felt he was ready for me	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ele klalo nam
He couldn’t get past it.	Mete ŋu to eŋu o.
That saved his life.	Ema xɔ eƒe agbe.
At least part of it.	Eƒe akpa aɖe ya teti.
To make things easier.	Be nuwo nanɔ bɔbɔe wu.
I have to see them.	Ele be makpɔ wo.
To do more and more.	Be nàwɔ geɖe wu.
I am working on that.	Mele dɔ wɔm tso ema ŋu.
I think we are, anyway	Mesusu be míenye, le mɔ sia mɔ nu
This is a complete lie.	Esia nye alakpa kura.
He is here to stay.	Ele afisia be yeanɔ anyi.
This is so easy, you don’t need anything else.	Esia le bɔbɔe ale gbegbe, mehiã nu bubu aɖeke o.
Everything went well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
He looked tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ene.
Continue.	Yi edzi.
I started with one for my life	Medze egɔme kple ɖeka na nye agbe
They? 	Wo?
I did the same, but something went wrong	Mewɔe nenema ke, gake nane gblẽ
I got this thing going on here	Mexɔ nu sia le edzi yim le afisia
I don’t want to be with them	Nyemedi be manɔ wo gbɔ o
I tried to imagine the right people for each room	Medze agbagba be makpɔ ame siwo sɔ na xɔ ɖesiaɖe le susu me
I think we’re having a good time	Mesusu be míele dzidzɔ kpɔm
I also had a job to do	Dɔ aɖe hã nɔ asinye mawɔ
That could take months from now.	Ema ate ŋu axɔ ɣleti geɖe tso fifia dzi.
I never really wanted another man in my life	Nyemedi ŋutsu bubu ŋutɔŋutɔ le nye agbe me gbeɖe o
In fact, this is not true.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia menye nyateƒe o.
But we definitely have a plan.	Gake ɖoɖo aɖe le mía si godoo.
I do this on my own	Mewɔa esia le ɖokuinye si
I will work with you.	Mawɔ dɔ kpli wò.
And it’s not the opposite.	Eye menye nusi to vovo na ema o.
They are in two parts.	Wole akpa eve me.
I'm sure he has more plans for me	Meka ɖe edzi be ɖoɖo geɖe wu le esi nam
I believe in hard work	Mexɔ dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ dzi se
It’s a pretty big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
In my mouth, it’s a string pattern.	Le nye nu me la, enye ka ƒe nɔnɔme.
You know what it’s like.	Ènya alesi wòle.
If not, it might not be.	Ne menye nenema o la, ke ɖewohĩ manɔ nenema o.
I'm going to continue	Mele edzi yim
From week to week.	Tso kwasiɖa me yi kwasiɖa me.
Please, just speak up.	Taflatse, ƒo nu ko.
I can do it on my own	Mate ŋu awɔe le ɖokuinye si
Define  .	Ɖe egɔme .
We know what can happen.	Míenya nusi ate ŋu adzɔ.
I need to try this some time.	Ele be mate esia kpɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
That would be the right person to do that.	Emae anye ame si sɔ be wòawɔ ema.
I met a man last night	Medo go ŋutsu aɖe le zã si va yi me
He is no longer there.	Megale afima o.
Blood too, maybe.	Ʋu hã, ɖewohĩ.
That’s what you are.	Wòe nye ema.
Here one encounters two problems.	Le afisia la, ame doa go kuxi eve.
A great opportunity lies ahead	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe le ŋgɔ gbɔna
He could not believe in death.	Mete ŋu xɔ ku dzi se o.
I will now come to rescue you	Mava azɔ be maɖe wò
I wouldn’t have been happy	Anye ne nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o
I didn’t know that about him.	Nyemenya nu ma le eŋu o.
Everyone was on it.	Amesiame nɔ edzi.
Maybe it was their only chance.	Ðewohĩ eya koe nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ na wo.
It is a thing	Enye nusi .
It could be a job.	Ate ŋu anye dɔ aɖe.
I actually cared about myself	Le nyateƒe me la, metsɔ ɖe le eme na ɖokuinye
He wasn’t alone in it.	Menye eya ɖeka koe nɔ eme o.
He needed food, and he hurried.	Ehiã nuɖuɖu, eye wòwɔ kaba.
You have two hours.	Gaƒoƒo eve le asiwò.
Everything is very good.	Nusianu le nyuie ŋutɔ.
I am not in my house.	Nyemele nye aƒeme o.
I just found this part-time job today	Egbea koe mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe ƒe dɔ sia
Contact us here.	Te ɖe mía ŋu le afisia.
I look forward to continuing to work with him	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be mayi edzi awɔ dɔ kplii
I’m glad time was never a problem.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ɣeyiɣi menye kuxi gbeɖe o.
All of these features work well.	Nɔnɔme siawo katã wɔa dɔ nyuie.
Reality is rarely that simple.	Ƒã hafi nu ŋutɔŋutɔ nɔa bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe.
I think that’s great for him.	Mesusu be ema nyo nɛ ŋutɔ.
I will be waiting for you	Manɔ lalam na wò
But he was different, too.	Gake eya hã to vovo.
Maybe I know what that is.	Ðewohĩ menya nusi ema nye.
I was curious enough to call them	Medi vevie be manya ale gbegbe be mate ŋu aƒo ka na wo
Just like a home for them.	Abe aƒe ene na wo ko.
There is no time for that.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli na ema o.
It is not impossible to join them.	Menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o be woawɔ ɖeka kpli wo o.
You can do it in many ways.	Àte ŋu awɔe le mɔ geɖe nu.
There is no other reason.	Susu bubu aɖeke meli o.
They have a heart.	Dzi le wo si.
I hope this happens	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia ava eme
I need time to relax	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi be maɖe dzi ɖi
I really don’t want to know.	Nyemedi ŋutɔŋutɔ be manya o.
He didn’t have to do that.	Mehiã be wòawɔ nu ma o.
If you’re going to do it, do it for a good reason.	Ne èle ewɔ ge la, ke wɔe le susu nyui aɖe ta.
You can do this.	Àte ŋu awɔ esia.
I gave him the money	Metsɔ ga la nɛ
No one else did that.	Ame bubu aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
I had promised myself	Medo ŋugbe na ɖokuinye kpɔ
The house, too.	Aƒea hã.
But that was only a few hours and not just a few days.	Gake gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo koe ema nye ke menye ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo ko o.
Everything is working fine.	Nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie.
I found too much of me in it	Mekpɔ nye nu geɖe akpa le eme
He wasn't doing that.	Menye ɖe wònɔ nu ma wɔm o.
But he can do it.	Gake ate ŋui.
I was as surprised as anyone.	Ewɔ nuku nam abe amesiame ene.
This is something new with me.	Esia nye nu yeye aɖe le ŋunye.
He is controlling it.	Ele edzi ɖum.
Good morning in any case.	Ŋdi nyui le nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe me.
I was so excited	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ale gbegbe
Just that one thing.	Nu ɖeka ma ko.
Just more than good.	Nusi wu nyui koe.
You are a loser tonight.	Ènye ame si bu le zã sia me.
Schedule your time.	Wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe wò ɣeyiɣi ŋu.
I can do better, better.	Mate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu, anyo wu.
I was so busy at work today	Vovo menɔ ŋunye le dɔme ale gbegbe egbea
I didn’t know hair could feel	Nyemenya be ɖa ate ŋu ase le eɖokui me o
I don’t know where this came from	Nyemenya afi si esia tso o
I would like to know what you would do	Madi be manya nu si nàwɔ
This is not a new phenomenon.	Esia menye nu yeye o.
I’m really sorry for you	Meɖe kuku na wò nyateƒe
I shouldn’t have done this	Mele be mawɔ esia hafi o
I have achieved something.	Meɖo nane gbɔ.
I can meet you when and where you want	Mate ŋu ado go le ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe si nèdi
That man knew what he wanted.	Ŋutsu ma nya nu si dim wònɔ.
That's probably going to happen to me anyway.	Anɔ eme be emae adzɔ ɖe dzinye le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I’ve got you.	Mexɔ wò.
I wish we could have done that.	Ne ɖe míate ŋui la, anye ne mewɔe nenema.
I still have to beat myself up	Ele nam kokoko be maƒo ɖokuinye
His head came up.	Eƒe ta va do ɖe dzi.
We are doing something good.	Míele nu nyui aɖe wɔm.
I didn’t really feel it	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me tututu o
I just have one small problem now.	Kuxi sue ɖeka koe le ŋunye fifia.
I really tried to do that this year	Mete kpɔ ŋutɔ be mawɔ ema le ƒe sia me
He had his gun.	Eƒe tu nɔ esi.
I can’t live like this	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe alea o
He just didn’t care.	Ðeko metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
I was there alone and had no money	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ afima eye ga aɖeke menɔ asinye o
I wasn’t nearly as excited about this.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe esia ŋu nenema gbegbe kloe o.
I liked him better	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam wu
It’s all for the night.	Wo katã nye zã me tɔ.
His voice is beautiful.	Eƒe gbe nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
I needed to see them	Ehiã be makpɔ wo
It never was, and it never will be.	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o, eye manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
His face is also beautiful.	Eƒe mo hã nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
He didn’t glance at her.	Metsɔ ŋku ɖo eŋu o.
And please book me back in the meantime.	Eye taflatse trɔ agbalẽ nam le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
I had no idea it was so small.	Nyemenya kura be ele sue nenema gbegbe o.
And no one can be like him.	Eye ame aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ abe eya ene o.
The result yet.	Nusi do tso eme haɖe o.
There could be several reasons for this.	Susu geɖe ate ŋu anɔ esia ta.
Almost everyone has a car.	Ʋu le amesiame kloe si.
I didn’t have that kind of money	Ga ma ƒomevi menɔ asinye o
I got my previous job this way.	Mexɔ nye dɔ si mewɔ va yi la le mɔ sia nu.
You can live longer.	Àte ŋu anɔ agbe didi wu.
Ideas from inside the room.	Susu siwo tso xɔa me.
He was a changed man.	Enye ame si trɔ.
There are a lot of people there now	Ame geɖe le afima fifia
I really like these books.	Agbalẽ siawo dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
This is a bad week to do something wrong.	Esia nye kwasiɖa gbegblẽ aɖe be woawɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖe.
I would do anything else.	Mawɔ nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
It will work with or without a head of hair.	Awɔ dɔ kple ɖa ƒe ta alo esi mele eŋu o.
I just got home.	Ðeko meɖo aƒeme.
I am losing control of myself.	Megale ɖokuinye dzi ɖum o.
I just did this to myself last week	Ðeko mewɔ esia ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu le kwasiɖa si va yi me
That didn’t work either.	Ema hã mewɔ dɔ o.
Something different	Nane si to vovo
Everything will be in order.	Nusianu anɔ ɖoɖo nu.
On the one hand, that means small.	Le go ɖeka me la, ema fia be ele sue.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
I hope you enjoy it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I didn’t see or hear anything last night	Nyemekpɔ naneke alo se naneke le zã si va yi me o
This is definitely one of them.	Esia nye wo dometɔ ɖeka godoo.
His session at least managed to achieve that.	Eƒe kpekpea te ŋu ɖo ema gbɔ ya teti.
There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eŋu o.
Now, of course.	Fifia ya.
I'm going to use you.	Mele wò zã ge.
But it will happen soon.	Gake ava eme kpuie.
I knew he was a good man	Menya be ame nyui aɖee wònye
I don’t really have anything	Naneke mele asinye ŋutɔŋutɔ o
But there were only a few.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔ anyi.
It’s quite a lot.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
There was no reason for this.	Susu aɖeke menɔ esia ŋu o.
Please help me out.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye.
It was a difficult time in my life	Enye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe le nye agbe me
They needed to act at once.	Ehiã be woawɔ nu zi ɖeka.
That part is correct.	Akpa ma sɔ.
I want things to live	Medi be nuwo nanɔ agbe
I am going to say that well	Mele nya ma gblɔ ge nyuie
But many problems remain.	Gake kuxi geɖe gakpɔtɔ li.
I will tell you what you should do.	Magblɔ nusi anyo be nàwɔ la na wò.
I want to do better things.	Medi be mawɔ nu siwo nyo wu.
Only a few people got inside.	Ame aɖewo koe ge ɖe eme.
I don’t know what to do.	Nyemenya nu si woawɔ o.
This seems to worry some people.	Edze abe esia tsi dzi ɖe ame aɖewo ŋu ene.
That much is obvious.	Nu ma gbegbe dze ƒã.
He is doing great today.	Ele nu gã aɖe wɔm egbea.
I had to check this out	Ele nam be makpɔ esia ɖa
Like a lot of kids really.	Abe ɖevi geɖe ene ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It’s like that.	Ele nenema.
Every place stays the same.	Teƒe ɖesiaɖe nɔa ɖeka.
I need time for myself	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi na ɖokuinye
They’re short, for one thing.	Wole kpuie, le nu ɖeka ta.
As you wish.	Abe alesi nèdi ene.
There is so much going on with school right now.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le edzi yim le suku ŋu fifia.
I promise you this	Medo ŋugbe na wò alea
Clearly, these two rules can reasonably coexist.	Edze ƒã be se eve siawo ate ŋu anɔ te ɖe wo nɔewo nu le mɔ si sɔ nu.
I also seemed to lose my voice	Edze abe nye gbe hã bu ene
Now it’s obvious.	Fifia edze ƒã.
I can only answer one thing at a time	Nu ɖeka koe mate ŋu aɖo eŋu le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me
You know how they are anyway.	Ènya alesi wole le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I work quickly.	Mewɔa dɔ kaba.
He couldn’t trust anyone these days.	Mete ŋu ka ɖe ame aɖeke dzi le ŋkeke siawo me o.
He handed her the gun in his leg.	Etsɔ tu si le eƒe afɔ me la nɛ.
I can’t quite understand it somehow	Nyemate ŋu ase egɔme tututu le mɔ aɖe nu o
You can’t escape that.	Màte ŋu asi le ema nu o.
We’re ready for that.	Míele klalo na ema.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But there are no jobs anywhere.	Gake dɔ aɖeke mele afi aɖeke o.
I have my whole life well organized	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe nye agbe bliboa ŋu nyuie
I should have known he had more than one car	Ðe wòle be manya be ʋu siwo wu ɖeka le esi hafi
I am not planning to go anywhere difficult today.	Nyemele ɖoɖo wɔm be mayi teƒe aɖeke si sesẽ egbea o.
It really is a great thing.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I haven’t seen another dog yet	Nyemekpɔ avu bubu aɖeke haɖe o
On the other hand, it might not.	Le go bubu me la, ɖewohĩ mawɔe nenema o.
For now, let me know what you think.	Fifia la, na manya nusi nèsusu.
I see you now, anyway	Mekpɔ wò fifia, le mɔ sia mɔ nu
I wondered if there was a big hole in it or something	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe do gã aɖe le eme alo nane hã
That wouldn’t work.	Ema mawɔ dɔ o.
Have a nice day everyone.	Ŋkeke nyui na amesiame.
He started looking for a new job.	Edze dɔ yeye didi gɔme.
Think of it as a new car.	Bu eŋu be enye ʋu yeye aɖe.
Obviously, it didn’t work out very well.	Edze ƒã be mewɔ dɔ nyuie tututu o.
An idea came to me	Susu aɖe va susu me nam
I hope he likes them	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wo adzɔ dzi nɛ
Please understand that.	Taflatse se egɔme nenema.
Come, however, come.	Va, ke hã, va.
You have to do a lot of things.	Ele be nàwɔ nu geɖe.
I couldn’t think of anything else	Nyemete ŋu bu nya bubu aɖeke ŋu o
I see no reason why this should be so.	Nyemekpɔ susu aɖeke si ta wòle be esia nanɔ nenema o.
I would have been like that.	Anye ne manɔ nenema hafi.
It contains both the first and the last.	Gbãtɔ kple mamlɛtɔ siaa le eme.
I touched on that quality.	Meka asi nɔnɔme ma ŋu.
And he tried hard to see what he had.	Eye edze agbagba vevie kpɔ nusi le esi.
I don’t want food.	Nyemedi nuɖuɖu o.
I needed to be here with you.	Ehiã be manɔ afisia kpli wò.
They have two children together.	Vi eve le wo si ɖekae.
I looked after the big city	Mekpɔ du gã la dzi
That’s our problem.	Emae nye míaƒe kuxi.
I am ready for some new things.	Mele klalo na nu yeye aɖewo.
But this book is different.	Gake agbalẽ sia ya to vovo.
I hadn’t the slightest idea what was going on	Nyemenya nusi nɔ edzi yim la ƒe susu sue aɖeke kura o
I forgive you what you have to do	Metsɔ nu si wòle be nàwɔ la ke wò
I still haven’t touched anything	Nyemeka asi naneke ŋu kokoko o
I thought it would make me angry, but it didn’t	Mesusu be ana mado dziku, gake mewɔe nenema o
I have good news for you	Nya nyui aɖe le asinye na mi
We need to do that more than ever now.	Ele be míawɔ ema wu tsã fifia.
In almost another hour.	Le gaƒoƒo bubu kloe me.
No one is talking.	Ame aɖeke mele nu ƒom o.
I shouldn’t do this all day.	Mele be mawɔ esia ŋkeke bliboa o.
I should have married an equal.	Ðe wòle be maɖe ame si sɔ kplii hafi.
I just found it an hour ago	Ðeko meke ɖe eŋu gaƒoƒo ɖeka koe nye esia
But that was another time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖee nye ema.
It will be in it.	Anɔ eme le eme.
But, well, we can’t have that.	Gake, nyuie, míate ŋu akpɔ ema o.
The man who doesn’t really want to.	Ŋutsu si medi ŋutɔŋutɔ o la.
But it isn’t.	Gake mele eme o.
I found the best one	Mekpɔ esi nyo wu
He had a good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe nɔ esi.
That will be useful too.	Ema hã aɖe vi.
I haven’t been this happy in a while	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ alea gbegbe o
I was watching them for too long	Menɔ wo kpɔm ɣeyiɣi didi akpa
I know there can be none	Menya be ɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi o
It wasn’t working.	Menɔ dɔ wɔm o.
Maybe I’m the exception.	Ðewohĩ nyee nye amesi to vovo.
I didn’t like that idea at all	Susu ma medze ŋunye kura o
I didn’t expect to be like that	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be manɔ nenema o
It’s starting to happen.	Edze egɔme.
But I want to be like that	Gake medi be manɔ nenema
I promise to get you out of here	Medo ŋugbe be maɖe wò le afisia
Do it that way.	Wɔe nenema.
I don’t know what to do with them	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ ɖe wo ŋu o
And he too	Eye eya hã .
I don’t need to see more.	Mehiã be makpɔ nu geɖe wu o.
I’ve always been so happy	Edzɔ dzi nam ale gbegbe ɣesiaɣi
There is no truth.	Nyateƒe aɖeke meli o.
I let myself fall backwards	Meɖe mɔ na ɖokuinye medze anyi ɖe megbe
We already know we have help.	Míenya xoxo be kpekpeɖeŋu le mía si.
But things are more complicated than that.	Gake nuwo sesẽ wu ema.
I needed a new challenge	Mehiã kuxi yeye aɖe
And yet he couldn’t let himself go.	Eye ke hã mete ŋu na eɖokui dzo o.
Why? 	Nu ka ta?
I just don’t know what else to do	Ðeko nyemenya nu bubu si mawɔ o
I can’t say what it is	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi wònye o
I have to do something now	Ele be mawɔ nane fifia
I haven’t heard back yet	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso megbe haɖe o
He needed more, more.	Ehiã nu geɖe wu, geɖe wu.
It's too small.	Ele sue akpa.
We don’t know anything yet.	Míenya naneke haɖe o.
I didn’t know what to say to him.	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ nɛ o.
People have seen you.	Amewo kpɔ wò.
It seemed like an honorable thing to do	Edze abe nusi ŋu bubu le be woawɔ ene
This cannot be to their liking.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ dzi na wo o.
I know you know what to do	Menya be ènya nusi nàwɔ
I needed this so badly.	Mehiã esia ale gbegbe.
I am between a rock and a hard place	Mele kpe aɖe kple teƒe sesẽ aɖe dome
I can’t do anything for him now	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke nɛ fifia o
I can imagine myself talking to you in the past	Mete ŋu kpɔa ɖokuinye le susu me be menɔ nu ƒom na wò va yi
It didn’t work well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie o.
I think that’s the hardest.	Mesusu be emae sesẽ wu.
I can understand to some extent	Mate ŋu ase nu gɔme vaseɖe afi aɖe
I, of course, was there to take care of things	Nye ya, menɔ afima be makpɔ nuwo dzi
I just have to be here	Ðeko wòle be manɔ afisia
The truth will make a way for itself.	Nyateƒea awɔ mɔ aɖe na eɖokui.
I really enjoy this	Esia dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
I was hoping for something better	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na nusi nyo wu
I can tell you the truth	Mate ŋu agblɔ nyateƒea na mi
I can provide the car	Mate ŋu ana ʋua
None of it makes sense.	Susu aɖeke mele wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o.
I don’t think it really matters.	Nyemesusu be ele vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Look at my house.	Kpɔ nye aƒe la ɖa.
He now had the truth.	Nyateƒea nɔ esi fifia.
It just doesn’t seem to be happening	Ðeko mewɔ abe ɖe mele edzi yim o ene
And from there.	Eye tso afima.
I like having my own money	Nye ŋutɔ nye ga nanɔ asinye dzɔa dzi nam
For the same reason.	Susu ma ke tae.
I think there are two things going on there	Mesusu be nu eve aɖewo le edzi yim le afima
This is likely to happen soon.	Anɔ eme be esia ava eme kpuie.
I can’t live with myself after this	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe kple ɖokuinye le esia megbe o
Much like you, in a way	Geɖe abe wò ene, le mɔ aɖe nu
He can work with that.	Ate ŋu awɔ dɔ kple ema.
I want a good person	Medi be ame nyui aɖe nanɔ asinye
Nothing seemed to work for me.	Edze abe naneke mewɔ dɔ nam o ene.
Some kind of problem arose	Kuxi aɖe ƒomevi do mo ɖa
I think you can go home now	Mesusu be àte ŋu ayi aƒeme fifia
Definitely a missed opportunity	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ si to ŋuwò godoo
Now it’s all gone.	Fifia la, wo katã nu yi.
I was always happy alone	Nye ɖeka koe kpɔa dzidzɔ ɣesiaɣi
I suddenly realized something very important about them	Mekpɔ nane si le vevie ŋutɔ le wo ŋu dze sii zi ɖeka
But there is nothing we can do about it now.	Gake naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu fifia o.
However, there is a problem with this.	Ke hã, kuxi aɖe le esia ŋu.
His heart sank a little.	Eƒe dzi kɔ vie.
I am ready for whatever may come	Mele klalo na nusianu si ate ŋu ava
I only asked one question, that was all	Nya ɖeka koe mebia, ema koe nye ema
At some point in time.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me.
I think it would be so good for you	Mesusu be anyo na wò ale gbegbe
No one in their right mind did.	Ame aɖeke si si susu nyui le la mewɔe nenema o.
I have to report a loss	Ele be magblɔ ame aɖe si bu la ŋu nya
I see the logic in it.	Mekpɔ susu si le eme.
Many qualities are important.	Nɔnɔme geɖe le vevie.
I thought you were running the house	Mesusu be wòe le aƒea dzi kpɔm
I hope everything gets better soon.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nusianu anyo ɖe edzi kpuie.
I can’t remember how many years ago.	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku ƒe nenie va yi dzi o.
It doesn’t work for me though.	Mewɔa dɔ nam o ke hã.
I don’t think it works.	Nyemesusu be mewɔa dɔ o.
I stayed in the car.	Metsi ʋua me.
In fact, this shouldn’t surprise us.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele be esia nawɔ nuku na mí o.
You can’t go home.	Màte ŋu ayi aƒeme o.
That you can do something like that.	Be àte ŋu awɔ nane si le abe ema ene.
I absolutely doubt this	Meke ɖi kura le esia ŋu
He didn’t understand.	Mese egɔme o.
It’s another time.	Ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖee.
Now you have to hurry.	Azɔ ele be nàwɔ kaba.
I remember my last day there	Meɖo ŋku nye ŋkeke mamlɛtɔ dzi le afima
There were many machines on it.	Mɔ̃ geɖe nɔ edzi.
Everyone else does it anyway.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe wɔa esia to mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I couldn’t leave early enough	Nyemete ŋu dzo le afima kaba o
You know this could be good for me.	Ènya be esia ate ŋu anyo nam.
He did this for months.	Ewɔ esia ɣleti geɖe.
I can’t handle that, not now	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ o, menye fifia o
I just want to live a simple life	Ðeko medi be manɔ agbe bɔbɔe
That was never me.	Nyee nye ema gbeɖe o.
One of the best places ever.	Teƒe ɖeka si nyo wu ɖesiaɖe.
I have seen smarter dogs	Mekpɔ avu siwo nya nu wu
But it doesn’t matter now.	Gake mehiã fifia o.
Everyone else left.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe dzo.
I tried to hurry out of the car	Medze agbagba be mawɔ kaba ado le ʋua me
I got them.	Mexɔ wo.
I had to come home soon after.	Ele be mava aƒeme le ema megbe kpuie.
And that was important to me.	Eye ema nɔ vevie nam.
But I felt it.	Gake mese le ɖokuinye me.
I was concerned about this	Metsi dzi ɖe esia ŋu
I will stay here.	Manɔ afisia.
It seems simple enough	Edze abe ɖe wòle bɔbɔe ene
One can only take so much	Nu geɖe koe ame ate ŋu axɔ
Actually, that would be a good thing.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema anye nu nyui aɖe.
I like men who act	Ŋutsu siwo wɔa nu la dzɔa dzi nam
But some others have more.	Gake geɖe le ame bubu aɖewo ya si.
I had a big part in it	Akpa gã aɖe nɔ asinye le eme
I can still talk to him	Mete ŋu ƒoa nu kplii kokoko
Short but focused.	Kpuie gake eƒe susu le nu ŋu.
Get rid of the police.	Ðe kpovitɔwo ɖa.
And you can do whatever you want with them.	Eye àte ŋu awɔ nu sia nu si nèdi kpli wo.
A really nice person too	Ame nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe hã
I can’t call anyone anyway	Nyemate ŋu aƒo ka na ame aɖeke le mɔ aɖeke nu o
I can’t see anything wrong anymore.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke azɔ o.
I should have been there an hour ago	Ele be manɔ afima gaƒoƒo ɖeka enye sia
Take care of my life.	Lé be na nye agbe.
Like his potential age.	Abe ƒe si wòate ŋu axɔ ene.
We don’t know where he is.	Míenya afisi wòle o.
But for some reason this is not working.	Gake le susu aɖewo ta la, esia mele dɔ wɔm o.
A hand flew to his mouth	Asi aɖe dzo yi eƒe nu gbɔ
He had never been to this part of the building.	Meva xɔa ƒe akpa sia kpɔ o.
This was very upsetting to me.	Esia te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
This book is in line with this.	Agbalẽ sia wɔ ɖeka kple esia.
He didn’t do it for a while.	Mewɔe ɣeyiɣi aɖeke o.
I can only be a kid once in a lifetime.	Zi ɖeka koe mate ŋu anye ɖevi le agbe me.
They are they are they are.	Va va va va va.
He had another name, of course.	Ŋkɔ bubu nɔ eya hã si ya.
I can’t imagine another one	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ bubu le susu me o
I am ready, in many ways.	Mele klalo, le mɔ geɖe nu.
I thought he was eating his food	Mesusu be ele eƒe nuɖuɖu ɖum
I should have been there	Ðe wòle be manɔ afima hafi
Too many people know about us now. 	Ame geɖe akpa nya nu tso mía ŋu fifia. 
Same with the issues from last year.	Nenema ke nya siwo le ƒe si va yi me hã.
I have always been like that	Menɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi
It’s just life.	Agbe koe wònye.
I have to play this differently.	Ele be maƒo esia le mɔ bubu nu.
I'm smart, you know	Medze aɖaŋu, ènya
They had nothing against him.	Naneke menɔ wo si le eŋu o.
I wondered where that went	Mebia ɖokuinye be afikae nya ma yi hã
He should act in the same way.	Ele be wòawɔ nu le mɔ ma ke nu.
I stepped closer	Meɖe afɔ ɖe eŋu wu
I didn’t have a gun, really.	Tu aɖeke menɔ asinye o, le nyateƒe me.
I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
I don’t know why that is	Nyemenya nusita wòle alea o
I needed to get out now	Ehiã be mado go fifia
This is a pretty big deal.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Not so much blood.	Menye ʋu geɖe nenema gbegbe o.
I always knew they were alive	Menya ɣesiaɣi be wole agbe
But now that is not the case.	Gake fifia megale nenema o.
He still didn't understand what he wanted.	Mese nusi dim wònɔ gɔme haɖe o.
I had advised him, but he didn’t listen	Meɖo aɖaŋu nɛ kpɔ, gake meɖo to o
That’s why we’re so excited about it.	Esia tae dzi dzɔa mí ŋutɔ ɖe eŋu ɖo.
I need the closest one	Mehiã esi te ɖe ŋunye wu
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
But he couldn’t help himself.	Gake mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe eɖokui nu o.
Or a part of it.	Alo eƒe akpa aɖe.
I was able to control myself	Mete ŋu ɖu ɖokuinye dzi
It’s something anyone can do.	Enye nusi ame sia ame ate ŋu awɔ.
But he wasn’t going to share that with anyone else.	Gake menɔ nya ma gblɔ ge na ame bubu aɖeke o.
I just hoped that was true	Ðeko menɔ mɔ kpɔm be nya ma nye nyateƒe
Death precedes life.	Ku doa ŋgɔ na agbe.
I’m not sure anyone has done that.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be ame aɖeke wɔe nenema o.
I will do the same.	Nye hã mawɔ nenema ke.
But no one dares to talk about that.	Gake dzi mele ame aɖeke ƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu o.
From the exact same source.	Tso teƒe ma ke tututu.
But something was bothering him.	Gake nane nɔ fu ɖem nɛ.
I never knew this before.	Nyemenya esia kpɔ o.
I should have done a better job	Ðe wòle be mawɔ dɔ si nyo wu hafi
I don’t know what to say to these people	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ na ame siawo o
But he was very tired after that.	Gake ɖeɖi te eŋu ŋutɔ le ema megbe.
But it didn’t look right.	Gake medze nyuie o.
I think this time is good	Mesusu be ɣeyiɣi sia nyo
If only he was alone, everything could have been easier.	Ne ɖe eya ɖeka koe la, anye ne nusianu ate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe wu.
This is not a blur.	Esia menye nusi me kɔ o.
I can’t imagine who could have done it	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ amesi ate ŋu awɔe hafi la le susu me o
I can meet you there too.	Mate ŋu ado go kpli wò le afima hã.
That could be the case, too.	Ema hã ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
Nice to meet you	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò
I have to do a good job	Ele be mawɔ dɔ nyuie
That guy will always work.	Ŋutsu ma awɔ dɔ ɣesiaɣi.
It’s a matter of fact.	Nya aɖee wònye.
It was very impressive	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
Again, we had a problem.	Le afisia hã la, kuxi aɖe do mo ɖa le mía ŋu.
I have a time of death and where	Ku ƒe ɣeyiɣi aɖe le asinye eye afikae
But still how it was.	Gake alesi wònɔ kokoko.
Four years is a long time.	Ƒe ene nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
I certainly am.	Mele nenema godoo.
I am working there.	Mele dɔ wɔm le afima.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
This also worked.	Esia hã wɔ dɔ.
Actually, just a few days ago.	Le nyateƒe me la, ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe nye esia.
I have a lot on my time	Nu geɖe le asinye le nye ɣeyiɣi ŋu
I have so many reasons for this	Susu geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye le esia ŋu
A car also left at one point	Ʋu aɖe hã dzo le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me
I can’t do this fast enough	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia kaba o
I like this but it’s not unusual	Esia dzɔa dzi nam gake menye nusi to vovo o
I am as curious as you are	Nye hã medi be manya nu abe wò ke ene
It was a very nice day.	Ŋkeke nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can only imagine the look on his face	Ðeko mate ŋu akpɔ ale si eƒe mo le la le susu me
Finally, summer has arrived.	Mlɔeba la, dzomeŋɔli va ɖo.
I could never be mad at him anyway	Nyemate ŋu anɔ dziku dom ɖe eŋu gbeɖe le mɔ sia mɔ nu o
I can’t remember where it is	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku afisi wòle dzi o
I have met many people from the past	Medo go ame geɖe siwo nɔ anyi va yi kpɔ
I can’t go out if that’s the case.	Nyemate ŋu ado go nenye be ele nenema o.
I need more alone time	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi geɖe na nye ɖeka
Time is money.	Ɣeyiɣi nye ga.
I can talk to him .	Mate ŋu aƒo nu kplii .
Represent.	Si le eteƒe.
The wind was blowing strongly.	Ya ƒo sesĩe.
I needed to do something for myself anyway.	Ehiã be mawɔ nane na ɖokuinye le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
It looked exactly like him.	Edze abe eya tututu ene.
And he felt the same way.	Eye eya hã se le eɖokui me nenema ke.
I want to know what is going on here	Medi be manya nusi le edzi yim le afisia
That’s pretty good, too.	Ema hã nyo ŋutɔ.
I really liked that too	Ema hã dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
Call them in the afternoon.	Ƒo ka na wo le ŋdɔ me.
Doing so is against the law.	Esia wɔwɔ tsi tre ɖe se ŋu.
I was under the impression that he was sane	Menɔ susu me nam be eƒe susu le nu ŋu nyuie
The night was completely gone.	Zã la nu yi kura.
Do it on your own time.	Wɔe le wò ŋutɔ wò ɣeyiɣi dzi.
Actually, there was something in it.	Le nyateƒe me la, nane nɔ eme.
I wondered how old he could be.	Mebia ɖokuinye be ƒe nenie wòate ŋu axɔ hã.
If these conditions are present.	Ne nɔnɔme siawo li la,...
I couldn’t do anything wrong	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o
Stay with us now.	Nɔ mía gbɔ fifia.
I can’t do it	Nyemate ŋu awɔe o
This is an obvious lie.	Esia nye alakpa si dze ƒã.
It's good now.	Anyo fifia.
Is wrong for two reasons.	Nye nu gbegblẽ le susu eve ta.
But nothing could be further from the truth.	Gake naneke mate ŋu anɔ ŋgɔ wu nyateƒea o.
He could have done anything, but this.	Ate ŋu awɔ nusianu hafi, gake esia ya.
I didn’t have much to save	Nu geɖe menɔ asinye maɖe o
It’s more than enough.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ wu.
It’s the perfect word for it.	Enye nya si sɔ nyuie na esia.
He did what he could.	Ewɔ nusi wòate ŋui.
I can’t relax.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe dzi ɖi o.
I can only have a corpse	Ame kuku aɖe koe ate ŋu anɔ asinye
I can’t get you out of here	Nyemate ŋu aɖe wò le afisia o
I could understand a little bit	Mete ŋu se egɔme vie
You can escape.	Àte ŋu asi.
I happily joined him	Mewɔ ɖeka kplii kple dzidzɔ
I will talk about something real	Maƒo nu tso nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe ŋu
I saw the whole thing.	Mekpɔ nu bliboa.
But in this case, you really don’t need to make one.	Gake le go sia me la, le nyateƒe me la, mehiã be nàwɔ ɖeke o.
It will take time for this.	Ahiã ɣeyiɣi na esia.
No one said it was	Ame aɖeke megblɔ be ele nenema o
Again, it wasn’t easy.	Le afisia hã la, menɔ bɔbɔe o.
Which is a mistake.	Nusi nye vodada.
But I focus on the man behind it.	Gake nye susu nɔa ŋutsu si le megbe nɛ la ŋu.
I have to read something	Ele be madi nane
No one surprised anyone at all.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ nuku na ame aɖeke kura o.
That should work.	Ele be ema nawɔ dɔ.
I know myself too well	Menya ɖokuinye nyuie akpa
I know these days are hard for you	Menya be ŋkeke siawo sesẽ na mi
Someone interested or someone else.	Ame aɖe si tsɔ ɖe le eme alo ame bubu aɖe.
And that’s pretty good.	Eye esia nyo ŋutɔ.
I really liked her in this	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ le esia me
We will work with them.	Míawɔ dɔ kpli wo.
I was ready to call	Menɔ klalo be maƒo ka
Do whatever you want with it.	Wɔ nusianu si nèdi tso eŋu.
I think it would be a surprise	Mesusu be anye nusi awɔ nuku na ame
I can put up with everything else.	Mete ŋu doa dzi le nu bubu ɖesiaɖe me.
I might have been more of a person.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖee menye wu hafi.
A man with a heart of stone	Ŋutsu aɖe si ƒe dzi le abe kpe ene
More will become clear in time.	Nu geɖe wu ava dze ƒã le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe.
I'm not going to spoil that	Menye ɖe mele ema gblẽ ge o
That ruined everything.	Ema gblẽ nusianu me.
He is now one of us.	Enye mía dometɔ ɖeka fifia.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Not nearly enough.	Menye nusi sɔ gbɔ kloe o.
I don’t want to, really	Nyemedi be mawɔe o, le nyateƒe me
Hold on to it.	Lé eŋu ɖe asi.
There is a loss.	Nusi bu la li.
I can definitely help you with that	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò le ema me godoo
It was a good life.	Agbe nyui aɖee wònye.
I do remember it.	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyateƒe.
Interesting point, in a way.	Nya si doa dzidzɔ na ame, le mɔ aɖe nu.
It was a difficult time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe.
More should have been done.	Ðe wòle be woawɔ nu geɖe wu hafi.
Last year was pretty good.	Ƒe si va yi nyo ŋutɔ.
I can’t just sit here	Nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi ɖe afisia ko o
It is also impossible.	Manya wɔ hã o.
I would like to do it on my own	Madi be mawɔe le ɖokuinye si
But it may not last long.	Gake ɖewohĩ manɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi o.
I used to be looking for a name	Tsã la, menɔ ŋkɔ dim
I really need to talk to you.	Ehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ be maƒo nu kpli wò.
I will find another way.	Madi mɔ bubu aɖe.
But also to protect his own policy.	Gake be yeakpɔ eya ŋutɔ ƒe ɖoɖo hã ta.
No one put a foot up.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ afɔ aɖeke ɖe dzi o.
But he couldn’t do it.	Gake mete ŋu wɔe o.
Everything is an opportunity.	Nusianu nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ.
People know us.	Amewo nya mí.
You couldn’t have given.	Màte ŋu ana nu hafi o.
There was something seriously absurd about it.	Nya aɖe si me susu mele o vevie nɔ eŋu.
On my own time.	Le nye ŋutɔ nye ɣeyiɣi dzi.
You have to fight them.	Ele be nàwɔ avu kpli wo.
I can’t go forward without him	Nyemate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ eya manɔmee o
However, he couldn’t see much.	Ke hã, mete ŋu kpɔ nu geɖe o.
I wonder where that came from	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be afikae nya ma tso hã
It worked out very well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
I don’t know who he really is	Nyemenya amesi tututu wònye o
It’s a challenge, a huge challenge.	Enye kuxi, kuxi gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I have the word well	Nya la le asinye nyuie
It looked like summer.	Edze abe dzomeŋɔli ene.
Everything must be done right.	Ele be woawɔ nu sia nu si sɔ.
No one came forward.	Ame aɖeke meva do ɖe ŋgɔ o.
That says something	Ema gblɔ nya aɖe
He is eating his mouth.	Ele eƒe nu ɖum.
Which is good.	Nusi nyo.
I understand so well what needs to be done	Mese nusi wòle be woawɔ gɔme nyuie ale gbegbe
But he didn’t let go.	Gake meɖe asi le eŋu o.
I told them about this book.	Megblɔ agbalẽ sia ŋu nya na wo.
Still, he could have called.	Ke hã, ate ŋu aƒo ka hafi.
I never really understood it and it never really explained it.	Nyemese egɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o eye meɖe eme ŋutɔŋutɔ hã kpɔ o.
I didn’t really like that	Ema medze ŋunye tututu o
I saw a man who shot him in the hand.	Mekpɔ ŋutsu aɖe si da tu eƒe asi.
I knew from there we were going to have a problem	Menya tso afima be kuxi aɖe ava mía dzi
Everyone on board must have been shocked.	Amesiame si nɔ ʋua me la anya wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
I have no problem with this now	Kuxi aɖeke mele ŋunye le esia ŋu fifia o
I hope that is clear.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ema me kɔ.
I happen to be winning	Edzɔ be mele dzi ɖum
That was never his problem.	Ema menye eƒe kuxi gbeɖe o.
I would love to do it	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔe
But, while it is.	Gake, esime wòle nenema.
This year has been a tough one for us.	Ƒe sia nye ƒe sesẽ aɖe na mí.
I want to enjoy it	Medi be makpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu
I needed to know more	Ehiã be manya nu geɖe wu
But that didn’t matter at that point.	Gake ema mehiã le ɣeyiɣi ma me o.
No one is lending him money anymore.	Ame aɖeke megale ga dom nɛ o.
And that he didn’t want to.	Eye be medi o.
However, it doesn’t always work.	Ke hã, mewɔa dɔ ɣesiaɣi o.
We don’t know what their situation is.	Míenya nɔnɔme si me wole o.
Get out of my house.	Do go le nye aƒe me.
If that person says something to you, listen.	Ne ame ma gblɔ nya aɖe na wò la, ɖo to.
Not sure if there is another room in the back or not.	Meka ɖe edzi nenye be xɔ bubu aɖe le megbe alo mele eme o.
I really liked his attitude	Eƒe nɔnɔme dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
I enjoy the work.	Dɔa dzɔa dzi nam.
I don’t want to marry you	Nyemedi be maɖe wò o
I just wanted to be with someone	Ðeko medi be mawɔ ɖeka kple ame aɖe
I don’t know what else to say	Nyemenya nya bubu si magblɔ o
But he didn’t know what to do.	Gake menya nusi wòawɔ o.
This is not realistic.	Esia menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I need one of them for my case	Mehiã wo dometɔ ɖeka na nye nya la
This will only take an hour.	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka koe esia axɔ.
In fact, we can say more.	Le nyateƒe me la, míate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe wu.
It’s just a fact of life.	Agbe me nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe koe wònye.
I did the same thing when I stood up.	Mewɔ nu ma ke esi metsi tre.
I have to make myself worthy, worthy	Ele be mawɔ ɖokuinye ame si dze, ame si dze
But neither of these conditions currently exists.	Gake nɔnɔme eve siawo dometɔ aɖeke meli fifia o.
I’m not making that up.	Menye nyee le nya ma wɔm o.
A summer morning greeted him	Dzomeŋɔli ƒe ŋdi aɖe do gbe nɛ
In his mind.	Le eƒe susu me.
You can’t tell me to do anything.	Màte ŋu agblɔ nam be mawɔ naneke o.
He seemed to enjoy it immensely.	Edze abe edzɔ dzi nɛ ale gbegbe ene.
After a while.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe.
It was just in his head.	Eƒe ta me koe wònɔ.
Please help me!!!.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye!!!.
About the house.	Le aƒea ŋu.
I can help you out.	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
Back in a big way.	Trɔ va le mɔ gã aɖe nu.
I need more than that	Mehiã nu geɖe wu ema
It was very impressive	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ
. . . .	.
Everyone is rushing out.	Amesiame le du dzi do go.
Everything is in the present.	Nusianu le fifia.
I trust him in my life	Meka ɖe edzi le nye agbe me
Show that it happened.	Fia nya be edzɔ.
I couldn’t be happier	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ wu ema o
And of course, they may have had a role.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ akpa aɖe nɔ wo si.
I want to deal with him	Medi be mawɔ nu kplii
I have things in my hands	Nuwo le asinye
I saw you there.	Mekpɔ wò le afima.
It didn’t get hot.	Mexɔ dzo o.
But in a loud voice.	Gake le gbe sesẽ me.
Go home now.	Yi aƒeme fifia.
A gust of wind blew in his face	Ya sesẽ aɖe ƒo ɖe eƒe mo
This year it worked for us.	Le ƒe sia me la, ewɔ dɔ na mí.
Keep going up.	Yi edzi yi dzi.
I just wanted to know about it	Ðeko medi be manya nu tso eŋu
I don’t know who he is.	Nyemenya amesi wònye o.
I would have no reason to do that	Susu aɖeke manɔ asinye mawɔ nenema o
I needed to tell him something	Ehiã be magblɔ nya aɖe nɛ
I can’t take my eyes off her	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nye ŋku ɖa le eŋu o
I can’t really be a part of it	Nyemate ŋu anye eƒe akpa aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ o
So did his own.	Nenema ke eya tɔ hã wɔe.
They are all four.	Wo katã wole ene.
I can’t figure out how to do that.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi mawɔ emae o.
Not after the fact.	Menye le nyateƒea megbe o.
He didn’t trust anyone.	Meka ɖe ame aɖeke dzi o.
There was no law against this.	Se aɖeke menɔ anyi si tsi tre ɖe esia ŋu o.
Many of them have never done that.	Wo dometɔ geɖe mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
He didn’t answer anything.	Meɖo nya aɖeke ŋu o.
And it’s already.	Eye wònye xoxo.
I need to talk to someone about this.	Ele be maƒo nu kple ame aɖe tso nya sia ŋu.
Just like real life.	Abe agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
And he was the only one.	Eye eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
But it didn’t matter.	Gake menɔ vevie o.
Ride.	Ku.
I can’t stand it myself	Nye ŋutɔ nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu o
Where he was last night.	Afisi wònɔ le zã si va yi me.
I am very sorry	Meɖe kuku vevie
It doesn’t make sense.	Susu mele eme o.
He can do this good.	Ate ŋu awɔ nyui sia.
I would definitely like to see more of that as well.	Madi godoo be makpɔ ema hã dometɔ geɖe wu.
And you can make it work.	Eye àte ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ.
Go too far ahead.	Yi ŋgɔ akpa.
I have to say it was amazing.	Ele be magblɔ be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
This has caused some to become very angry.	Esia na ame aɖewo do dziku vevie.
Not now anyway.	Menye fifia o le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I certainly hope you enjoyed it	Mekpɔ mɔ godoo be edzɔ dzi na wò
I also know he needs you	Menya hã be ehiã wò
I hear there is one in this town	Mese be ɖeka le du sia me
He could not begin to imagine what must have happened.	Mete ŋu dze nusi anya dzɔ le susu me gɔme o.
Too much kept running through his mind.	Nu geɖe akpa yi edzi nɔ du dzi le eƒe susu me.
And guns aren’t cheap.	Eye tu hã mexɔ asi o.
There was a deeper problem.	Kuxi aɖe si de to wu la nɔ anyi.
It didn’t work well.	Mewɔ dɔ nyuie o.
I explained the difficult problem that plagued us	Meɖe kuxi sesẽ si ɖe fu na mí la me
I had been planning this for some time	Menɔ ɖoɖo wɔm ɖe esia ŋu ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
Take something with you.	Tsɔ nane ɖe asi.
But it didn’t stay.	Gake metsi anyi o.
We definitely have a problem.	Kuxi aɖe le mía ŋu godoo.
I did tell them that	Megblɔ nya ma na wo nyateƒe
You might as well.	Wò hã ɖewohĩ.
Each device must have its own characteristics.	Ele be mɔ̃ ɖesiaɖe ƒe nɔnɔme nanɔ esi.
Consider the incident.	Bu nu si dzɔ la ŋu kpɔ.
It just might be that way.	Ðeko wòate ŋu anɔ nenema.
I did it a long time ago	Mewɔe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia
My job has put me on the road a lot.	Nye dɔa na meva le mɔ dzi ŋutɔ.
I need to talk to you now	Ehiã be maƒo nu na wò fifia
We have so much for this year.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le mía si na ƒe sia.
I wanted to try	Medi be mate kpɔ
No one knows his real name or past	Ame aɖeke menya eƒe ŋkɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ alo agbe si wònɔ va yi o
I’m never going to write one.	Nyemele ɖeka ŋlɔ ge gbeɖe o.
I am looking for reality.	Mele nu ŋutɔŋutɔ dim.
One day is enough for me	Gbe ɖeka sɔ gbɔ nam
He can do it.	Ate ŋu awɔe.
I am convinced of my truth.	Meka ɖe nye nyateƒea dzi.
This is another thing I enjoy.	Esia hã nye nu bubu si doa dzidzɔ nam.
I believe in that	Mexɔ ema dzi se
But it didn’t do much for you.	Gake mewɔ nu boo aɖeke na wò o.
Preferably in the summer.	Anyo wu le dzomeŋɔli.
We are living in a new day.	Míele agbe le ŋkeke yeye aɖe dzi.
This time there had never been a chance.	Fifia ya mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
There is nothing in between.	Naneke mele wo dome o.
I am looking forward to seeing this.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be makpɔ esia.
I was nervous, that was all	Metsi dzodzodzoe, ema koe nye ema
In the long run.	Le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe me.
I think that’s a good thing	Mesusu be esia nye nu nyui aɖe
This is a bad idea in every way.	Esia nye susu gbegblẽ le go sia go me.
But I didn’t feel it either	Gake nye ya mese le ɖokuinye me be nye hã mese le ɖokuinye me o
I don’t have any children.	Vi aɖeke mele asinye o.
I look forward to greeting you all	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be mado gbe na mi katã
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That saved them, in a way.	Ema xɔ na wo, le mɔ aɖe nu.
And yet he didn’t touch me.	Eye ke hã meka asi ŋunye o.
I don’t want them.	Nyemedi wo o.
I have to go with you	Ele be mayi kpli wò
There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eŋu o.
Coming to the present case.	Va ɖo nya si li fifia gbɔ.
I’m not sure when that really happened	Nyemeka ɖe ɣekaɣie ema dzɔ dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o
This works well, really, really well.	Esia wɔa dɔ nyuie, ŋutɔŋutɔ, nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That was what surprised him.	Emae nye nusi wɔ nuku nɛ.
You can do it yourself.	Wò ŋutɔ àte ŋu awɔe.
I want to move on with my life	Medi be mayi nye agbe dzi
I hurry out of the car	Mewɔa kaba doa go le ʋua me
Change them every once in a while.	Trɔ wo zi ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi aɖewo me.
I can handle that	Mate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ
I want to see what you like about it	Medi be makpɔ nu siwo dzɔa dzi na wò le eŋu
That’s probably his one big thing.	Anɔ eme be emae nye eƒe nu gã ɖeka.
I just didn’t have it.	Ðeko menɔ asinye o.
Start joining us today.	Dze egɔme nàwɔ ɖeka kpli mí egbea.
I was able to work.	Mete ŋu wɔ dɔ.
Something to be done.	Nane si woawɔ.
Maybe this would work better.	Ðewohĩ esia awɔ dɔ nyuie wu.
I think we can still help	Mesusu be míate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu kokoko
Here it is the opposite.	Le afisia la, nusi to vovo na emae.
It was a difficult job.	Dɔ sesẽ aɖee wònye.
This is also an extremely difficult issue	Esia hã nye nya sesẽ aɖe si gbɔ eme
We had plenty of space and could provide space if needed.	Teƒe geɖe nɔ mía si eye ate ŋu ana teƒe ne ehiã.
Or part of it is about me.	Alo eƒe akpa aɖe ku ɖe ŋunye.
He was a great dog.	Avu gã aɖee wònye.
I obviously missed something	Edze ƒã be nane to ŋunye
He was very attracted to her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I have definitely met.	Medo go godoo.
I don’t know where, how, he lived	Nyemenya afi si, aleke, wònɔ agbe ɖo o
Maybe you can but this is not me.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋui gake menye nyee nye esia o.
I want to be among them	Medi be manɔ wo dome
But it's not quite working.	Gake mele dɔ wɔm tututu o.
Interestingly enough, that.	Nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame, be.
I am definitely like that	Nyee nye nenema godoo
I know, too easy again	Menya, ele bɔbɔe akpa ake
I'll see you tomorrow morning.	Makpɔ wò etsɔ ŋdi.
I was furious	Medo dziku vevie
In fact, it is possible.	Le nyateƒe me la, anya wɔe.
But the outcome is clear.	Gake nusi ado tso eme la me kɔ nyuie.
Doing so is exciting.	Esia wɔwɔ doa dzidzɔ na ame.
I think this technique has been very helpful.	Mesusu be aɖaŋu sia kpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ.
I just had to get out of there	Ðeko wòle be mado le afima
But it wasn’t me.	Gake menye nyee o.
I don’t see anything really wrong with it	Nyemekpɔ naneke si gblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ le eŋu o
It was a lot of fun for us.	Edzɔ dzi na mí ŋutɔ.
Many things can happen	Nu geɖe ate ŋu adzɔ
The house is very nice.	Aƒea nyo ŋutɔ.
Not sure how many of them there were.	Meka ɖe edzi be wo dometɔ nenie nye ema o.
That time has passed.	Ɣeyiɣi ma va yi.
There is no car.	Ʋu aɖeke meli o.
I know what kind of people you are.	Menya ame siwo ƒomevi nènye.
A bad song.	Ha gbegblẽ aɖe.
I want to share some good news	Medi be magblɔ nya nyui aɖewo na amewo
I wanted a man who would take over	Medi ŋutsu si axɔ dɔa
Everything was excellent.	Nusianu nyo ŋutɔ.
There is simply no reason.	Ðeko susu aɖeke meli o.
It won’t meet my eye.	Mado go nye ŋku o.
In these cases, certain conditions must exist.	Le nɔnɔme siawo me la, ele be nɔnɔme aɖewo nanɔ anyi.
But in reality, it can happen.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, ate ŋu adzɔ.
But we’re all fine now.	Gake mí katã míele nyuie fifia.
I’m worried about you.	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò.
A few large buildings.	Xɔ gã ʋɛ aɖewo.
Things didn’t go his way.	Nuwo meva yi eƒe mɔ nu o.
I have an idea of ​​what we should do	Susu aɖe le asinye le nusi wòle be míawɔ ŋu
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
I tried to keep my eyes on him	Medze agbagba be nye ŋku nanɔ eŋu
He never said much.	Megblɔ nya geɖe kpɔ o.
But he wasn’t satisfied.	Gake eƒe dzi medze eme o.
At that point, I had a new plan in mind.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, ɖoɖo yeye aɖe va susu me nam.
Otherwise, it is.	Ne menye nenema o la.
I’ve already married you	Meɖe wò xoxo
I hope it doesn’t come to that	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mava ɖo ema gbɔ o
It was a very great day.	Enye ŋkeke gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I didn’t really see that	Nyemekpɔ ema ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I understand why you liked the car	Mese nusita ʋua dze ŋuwò gɔme
Not now, not at any time.	Menye fifia o, menye le ɣeyiɣi aɖeke me o.
He fled the scene.	Esi dzo.
A little awkwardness	Nu sue aɖe si mewɔa nu nyuie o
It looked good to him.	Edze nyuie nɛ.
There is no one here.	Ame aɖeke mele afisia o.
He seemed surprised.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku nɛ ene.
And perhaps for good reason.	Eye ɖewohĩ susu nyui aɖe tae wòle nenema ɖo.
I want to share that with you	Medi be magblɔ nya ma na mi
I decided to lend a hand.	Meɖoe be mado asi ɖe edzi.
There was no job for someone like him.	Dɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi na ame abe eya ene o.
But that wasn’t what they had in mind at all.	Gake menye emae nɔ susu me na wo kura o.
I know exactly who he is	Menya amesi tututu wònye
I can’t do anything about it anyway	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso eŋu le mɔ aɖeke nu o
I never knew anything about this	Nyemenya naneke tso esia ŋu kpɔ o
I don’t want to hit you.	Nyemedi be maƒo wò o.
There’s a lot I don’t understand.	Nu geɖe li si gɔme mese o.
I was very impressed with him	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
No one had ever heard of that.	Ame aɖeke mese nya ma kpɔ o.
But, he obviously can’t control himself.	Gake, edze ƒã be mate ŋu aɖu eɖokui dzi o.
But it will give us the opportunity to work together.	Gake ana mɔnukpɔkpɔ mí be míawɔ dɔ ɖekae.
I was eating with my people.	Menɔ nu ɖum kple nye amewo.
I was a great help to many of them	Menye kpekpeɖeŋu gã aɖe na wo dometɔ geɖe
I don’t know who was looking back.	Nyemenya amesi nɔ megbe kpɔm o.
I advised them it would be	Meɖo aɖaŋu na wo be anye nenema
Think about your own.	Bu wò tɔ ŋu kpɔ.
It is a difficult problem.	Enye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
I am able to work from home	Mete ŋu wɔa dɔ tso aƒeme
We had another situation, some time ago.	Nɔnɔme bubu aɖe hã nɔ mía me, ɣeyiɣi aɖe va yi.
In fact, we were a surprising finalist.	Le nyateƒe me la, míenye ame mamlɛtɔ si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Its very large.	Eƒe gã ŋutɔ.
I hope everyone like there gives	Mele mɔ kpɔm be amesiame abe afima ene la ana nu
I can’t just get rid of it	Nyemate ŋu aɖee ɖa ko o
At another time, the truth will come out.	Le ɣeyiɣi bubu me la, nyateƒea ado go.
Maybe there is something in it.	Ðewohĩ nane anɔ eme.
I don’t know any of them well	Nyemenya wo dometɔ aɖeke nyuie o
It wouldn’t occur to him.	Mava susu me nɛ o.
I hope they like it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wo adzɔ dzi na wo
Take what you want.	Tsɔ nusi dim nèle.
I shouldn’t have been surprised	Mele be wòawɔ nuku nam hafi o
I thought everything was wonderful	Mesusu be nusianu wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
I doubt it, but they have no guns	Meke ɖi le eŋu, gake tu aɖeke mele wo si o
But there was another reason.	Gake susu bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
In fact, quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo kura na emae.
It is obviously in and out.	Edze ƒã be ele eme eye wòle eme.
It kind of makes sense to me.	Susu le eme nam ƒomevi aɖe.
I wonder if an hour has passed there	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe gaƒoƒo ɖeka va yi le afima hã
If he cares about her.	Ne etsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ la.
I introduced myself.	Meɖe ɖokuinye fia.
This school is now broken.	Suku sia gblẽ fifia.
It has no characteristics.	Nɔnɔme aɖeke mele eŋu o.
There was no one in the room.	Ame aɖeke menɔ xɔa me o.
But what do I know.	Gake nukae menya.
But I had to go.	Gake ele nam be mayi.
I must let you go now	Ele be maɖe asi le ŋuwò azɔ
But a lot of time has passed	Gake ɣeyiɣi geɖe va yi
Remove the head.	Ðe ta la le eme.
There was never money.	Ga menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
Now that is something.	Fifia ema nye nane.
This went on for months.	Esia yi edzi ɣleti geɖe.
I want to see that place too	Medi be makpɔ teƒe ma hã
I was waiting for this moment	Menɔ ɣeyiɣi sia lalam
There was also a small problem.	Kuxi sue aɖe hã nɔ anyi.
I had something to say	Nya aɖe nɔ asinye magblɔ
He didn’t just want to make money.	Medi be yeakpɔ ga ko o.
I want you and no one else	Medi wò ke menye ame bubu aɖeke o
But maybe he understood as well.	Gake ɖewohĩ eya hã se egɔme nenema ke.
It’s a fact.	Enye nyateƒe.
We’re fine, we’re fine.	Míele nyuie, míele nyuie.
This is not an opportunity.	Esia menye mɔnukpɔkpɔ o.
I can take care of myself.	Mate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye dzi.
And others who are interested.	Eye ame bubu siwo tsɔ ɖe le eme hã.
No one knows where they are.	Ame aɖeke menya afisi wole o.
I think there is that.	Mesusu be ema li.
He didn’t say that anywhere.	Megblɔ nya ma le afi aɖeke o.
That can’t be the case.	Ema mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
But it can’t be that way.	Gake mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
It will kill you.	Awu wò.
I’m not sure I liked anything.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be naneke do dzidzɔ nam o.
I was furious with him	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu vevie
A long week.	Kwasiɖa didi aɖe.
Or this week.	Alo kwasiɖa sia me.
Something is wrong, very wrong.	Nane gblẽ, gblẽ ŋutɔ.
I am very interested in you	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò ŋutɔ
There was a hard job to do.	Dɔ sesẽ aɖe nɔ anyi woawɔ.
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Gake naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ tso eŋu o.
I am not happy if he does this	Nyemele dzidzɔ kpɔm ne ewɔ esia o
I just couldn’t bear it	Ðeko nyemete ŋu do dzi o
But the room was oddly out of shape.	Gake xɔa me nɔ nɔnɔme aɖeke me o le mɔ si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ nu.
Lots and lots of very angry, very loud people.	Ame geɖe kple geɖe siwo doa dziku ŋutɔ, siwo doa gbe sesĩe ŋutɔ.
He doesn’t deserve this car.	Medze na ʋu sia o.
I thought they were on me	Mesusu be wole dzinye
It might be another deserted road.	Ðewohĩ anye mɔ bubu si dzi ame aɖeke mele o.
Nothing mattered much after that, not really.	Naneke mehiã boo le ema megbe o, menye le nyateƒe me la, mehiã o.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe li siwo tae.
I wonder what it’s like	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke wòle hã
We just focus on what we have to do.	Ðeko míaƒe susu nɔa nu siwo wòle be míawɔ ŋu.
I deserve to have you to myself	Medze be wò nanɔ ɖokuinye si
He looked very tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ŋutɔ ene.
I couldn’t stay there	Nyemete ŋu nɔ afima o
You’re a good guy.	Wòe nye ŋutsu nyui aɖe.
Nothing new, of course.	Nu yeye aɖeke meli o ya.
I couldn’t stand that	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe ema nu o
I know it’s not something you like	Menya be menye nusi dzɔa dzi na wòe o
But the result was the same.	Gake nu ɖeka ma ke do tso eme.
He didn’t let go of her.	Meɖe asi le eŋu o.
He has a point though.	Nya aɖe le esi gake.
We knew that pretty quickly.	Míenya ema kaba ŋutɔ.
I just got into it myself	Ðeko nye ŋutɔ meva ge ɖe eme
His heart sank a little.	Eƒe dzi kɔ vie.
I shouldn’t have done it	Mele be mawɔe hafi o
I think, at this point, it will	Mesusu be, le afisia la, awɔe
Come and think about it.	Va bu eŋu kpɔ.
On the highway.	Le mɔ gã la dzi.
I think that’s a good idea	Mesusu be susu nyui aɖee nye ema
He is going through a difficult time.	Ele ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe me tom.
I hope people don't bother him	Mele mɔ kpɔm be amewo maɖe fu nɛ o
Not someone like him at all.	Menye ame aɖe si le abe eya ene kura o.
A good thing, too.	Nu nyui aɖe hã.
I didn’t feel like sitting there	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be manɔ anyi ɖe afima o
I can give you a good time	Mate ŋu ana ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe wò
But now, of course.	Gake fifia ya.
And you can do it too.	Eye wò hã àte ŋui.
I can’t be with these people right now	Nyemate ŋu anɔ ame siawo gbɔ fifia o

I don’t want to let go.	Nyemedi be maɖe asi le eŋu o.
I thought it was a dead man.	Mesusu be ame kuku aɖee.
I wouldn’t have been able to get out of mine	Anye ne nyemate ŋu ado le nye ŋutɔ tɔ me o
And not real life.	Eye menye agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I should have told you they were looking for you	Ðe wòle be magblɔ na wò be wole wò dim hafi
I don’t think it is now.	Nyemesusu be ele nenema fifia o.
I have a difficult situation	Nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe le asinye
I didn’t expect this	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na esia o
I think everyone is out by now	Mesusu be amesiame do go vaseɖe fifia
This can be very useful.	Esia ate ŋu aɖe vi ŋutɔ.
I really don’t want to talk about this	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be maƒo nu tso nya sia ŋu o
It’s the last one.	Enye mamlɛtɔ.
He had deserved that, too.	Edze nɛ nenema kpɔ, eya hã.
I remember, a bit	Meɖo ŋku edzi, vie
After tonight, everything is going to be different.	Le zã sia megbe la, nusianu ava to vovo.
I was doing something wrong	Menɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖe wɔm
And reasonable prices, too.	Eye asi siwo sɔ, hã.
I used to know everything that touched his heart	Tsã la, menya nusianu si wɔa dɔ ɖe eƒe dzi dzi
This is a simple matter.	Nya sia le bɔbɔe.
It’s like something new.	Ele abe nu yeye ene.
He never reached out to me.	Medo asi ɖe dzinye kpɔ o.
I was the man in her life.	Nyee nye ŋutsu si nɔ eƒe agbe me.
Either that, or you’re the voice in my head.	Ema, alo wòe nye gbe si le nye ta me.
We have to do this.	Ele be míawɔ esia.
Everyone probably does this.	Anɔ eme be amesiame wɔa esia.
That was a process that went on many, many times.	Ema nye ɖoɖo aɖe si yi edzi zi geɖe, zi geɖe.
It will take some time to do something with the building.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe hafi woawɔ nane kple xɔa.
I would say who died today	Magblɔ be ame si ku egbea
I just don’t really know what it is	Ðeko nyemenya nusi tututu wònye o
I have been there for a very long time	Mele afima ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ
But I’m not sure I would	Gake nye ya meka ɖe edzi be mawɔe nenema o
I had to save them	Ele be maɖe wo
I think that’s important	Mesusu be ema le vevie
I told him something	Megblɔ nya aɖe nɛ
I don’t have a separate section	Akpa aɖeke mele asinye ɖe vovo o
I told you that before	Megblɔ nya ma na mi do ŋgɔ
If not, try something else.	Ne menye nenema o la, ke te nu bubu aɖe kpɔ.
No one believed him.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ edzi se o.
That is a valid statement.	Nya ma sɔ.
And that's it.	Eye ema.
Nothing makes sense in that.	Susu mele naneke ŋu le nya ma me o.
And chances are there’s more where that comes from.	Eye mɔnukpɔkpɔ li be nu geɖe wu le afisi ema tso.
I sort of worked it all out	Mewɔ dɔ tso wo katã ŋu le mɔ aɖe nu
I would know all about you	Anye ne manya nu tso ŋuwò katã
We don’t know any of these things.	Míenya nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke o.
Almost, but not quite.	Kloe, gake menye nenema tututu o.
Do what you want for me.	Wɔ nu si nèdi nam.
No other work is required.	Dɔ bubu aɖeke mehiã o.
It won’t and can’t work.	Mawɔ dɔ o eye mate ŋu awɔ dɔ hã o.
You can work with it.	Àte ŋu awɔ dɔ kplii.
That’s why he didn’t stay here long.	Esia tae menɔ afisia eteƒe didi o ɖo.
But I knew who he was	Gake menya amesi wònye
Mava.	Mava.
I'm not fucking around.	Nyemele fu ɖem le afima o.
For all sorts of things.	Na nu ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe.
The snake is the snake is the snake	Da nye da nye da
This is close to the.	Esia te ɖe eŋu le.
Now he understood nothing.	Fifia mese naneke gɔme o.
I did and I got this	Mewɔe eye mexɔ esia
I gave him this book.	Metsɔ agbalẽ sia nɛ.
Look, man, he can do it.	Kpɔ ɖa, ŋutsu, ate ŋu awɔe.
It’s definitely a challenge.	Enye kuxi aɖe godoo.
I suddenly let go as he gasped for air	Meɖe asi le eŋu zi ɖeka esi wònɔ ya ƒom
Something was still ahead of him.	Nane gakpɔtɔ nɔ ŋgɔ nɛ.
You still have no idea.	Susu aɖeke megale asiwò kokoko o.
I might have to do the same.	Ðewohĩ ahiã be mawɔe nenema ke.
This was all there was.	Esia koe nɔ anyi.
I just don’t want to do it	Ðeko nyemedi be mawɔe o
Exactly.	Tututu.
I couldn’t face them	Nyemete ŋu dze ŋgɔ wo o
This seems like a good thing.	Esia dze abe nu nyui aɖee wònye ene.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I hope someone knows what to do	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ame aɖe nya nusi wòawɔ
There is plenty of water.	Tsi sɔ gbɔ ɖe afima.
I did, and it’s waiting for you.	Mewɔe, eye wòle lalam na wò.
There was also a mistake.	Vodada hã nɔ eme.
I liked him a little more.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam vie wu.
I am sure you are a good person	Meka ɖe edzi be ènye ame nyui aɖe
I know where he is	Menya afisi wòle
In this he made a mistake.	Le esia me la, ewɔ vodada.
I felt you in me	Mese le ɖokuinye me be èle menye
I should have mentioned that	Ðe wòle be maƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu hafi
I know.	Menya.
I hope you didn't mind	Mele mɔ kpɔm be meɖe fu na wò o
I should have mentioned that earlier.	Ðe wòle be maƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu do ŋgɔ hafi.
I have a lot of money on this guy	Ga geɖe le asinye le ŋutsu sia ŋu
Every two months.	Ɣleti eve ɖesiaɖe.
He had a big problem.	Kuxi gã aɖe nɔ eŋu.
The whole town came.	Du bliboa va.
Until several weeks later.	Vaseɖe kwasiɖa geɖe megbe.
I can’t take my eyes off you	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nye ŋku ɖa le ŋuwò o
I can’t imagine what would have happened if everyone knew.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi adzɔ ne ɖe amesiame nya la le susu me o.
I lived there for many years	Menɔ afima ƒe geɖe
I was alone in my house	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ nye aƒeme
I saw what he was looking for.	Mekpɔ nusi dim wònɔ.
He won’t tell me where he used to be.	Magblɔ afisi wònɔ tsã nam o.
All you did was follow your heart.	Nu si nèwɔ koe nye be nàwɔ ɖe wò dzi dzi.
Tell me what is true, what is not true.	Gblɔ nusi nye nyateƒe, nusi menye nyateƒe o nam.
I hoped he felt the same way	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be eya hã ase le eɖokui me nenema ke
I believe in it.	Mexɔ edzi se.
You don’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke mele asiwò o.
You can help me out.	Àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
That is a completely different story.	Nya ma to vovo kura.
I can’t explain it any other way	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eme le mɔ bubu aɖeke nu o
I reminded myself that everything would be okay	Meɖo ŋku edzi na ɖokuinye be nusianu anyo
All of these things have come out of it	Nu siawo katã do tso eme
A very big problem	Kuxi gã aɖe ŋutɔ
I suffered from the same problem	Kuxi ma ke kpe fu nam
I would probably become very famous for that.	Anɔ eme be mava xɔ ŋkɔ ŋutɔ le ema ta.
I had two children.	Vi eve nɔ asinye.
It would be a great thing.	Anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Let me just say two quick things.	Mina magblɔ nya eve kaba ko.
I don’t know these people	Nyemenya ame siawo o
I needed to save his life	Ehiã be maɖe eƒe agbe
Maybe someone was there.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe nɔ afima.
I shouldn’t have said so much	Mele be magblɔ nya geɖe nenema gbegbe hafi o
I work harder, maybe because of it	Mewɔa dɔ sesĩe wu, ɖewohĩ le esia ta
I'm just trying to protect myself	Ðeko mele agbagba dzem be makpɔ ɖokuinye ta
This is a lie.	Esia nye alakpa.
I had nothing to say anyway	Nya aɖeke menɔ asinye magblɔ le mɔ aɖeke nu o
I talked to him.	Meɖo dze kplii.
I saw his face	Mekpɔ eƒe mo
We have to work until the job is done.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ vaseɖe esime dɔa wu enu.
I didn’t report to you.	Nyemeka nya ta na mi o.
I can’t stay in the same room	Nyemate ŋu anɔ xɔ ɖeka me o
He pressed something into her hand.	Etsɔ nane te ɖe eƒe asi me.
I am single now.	Menye tre fifia.
I think we can survive for a long time	Mesusu be míate ŋu anɔ agbe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe
A party has attitude	Nɔnɔme le akpa aɖe si
I definitely got my room priced	Mekpɔ nye xɔa ƒe asi godoo
This is enough for us.	Esia sɔ gbɔ na mí.
Eventually, everyone laughed.	Mlɔeba la, amesiame ko nu.
Do a good job.	Wɔ dɔ nyui aɖe.
A man can walk on water	Ŋutsu ate ŋu azɔ tsi dzi
It would have been a very good thing	Anye ne anye nu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ hafi
He knew nothing about them.	Menya naneke tso wo ŋu o.
I was on my own.	Menɔ ɖokuinye si.
I still couldn’t quite bring it all in	Nyemete ŋu tsɔ wo katã va eme tututu kokoko o
I know what to do now.	Menya nusi mawɔ fifia.
That’s why but he didn’t get sick or anything.	Esia tae gake medze dɔ alo naneke o.
That would work well enough.	Ema awɔ dɔ nyuie ale gbegbe.
A few people rushed inside	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo ƒu du va ge ɖe eme
There is no reason to fight.	Susu aɖeke meli si tae wòle be míawɔ avu ɖo o.
We have to try them.	Ele be míate wo kpɔ.
It didn’t bother me at all, really	Meɖe fu nam kura o, le nyateƒe me
Something hit, but only in your head.	Nane ƒo, gake wò ta me koe.
I really need to see you	Ele be makpɔ wò ŋutɔŋutɔ
It is unnecessary and ineffective in any way.	Mehiã o eye mewɔa dɔ le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
We have the desire.	Didi la le mía si.
I knew he would answer	Menya be aɖo eŋu
I like the way my life is	Ale si nye agbe le la dzɔa dzi nam
I still have to stay home	Ele kokoko be manɔ aƒeme
There are no rules for this stuff.	Se aɖeke meli na nu sia o.
I remember that day, and that night	Meɖo ŋku ŋkeke ma dzi, kple zã ma dzi
I actually enjoyed it a lot.	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Get in, get in anyway.	Ge ɖe eme, ge ɖe eme to mɔ sia mɔ nu.
He never said a word.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke gbeɖe o.
I assure you, we are all in this together	Meka ɖe edzi na mi be, mí katã míele esia me ɖekae
I felt satisfied afterwards	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme le ema megbe
That’s a lot of things going on.	Ema nye nu geɖe siwo le edzi yim.
A couple of them caught his eye	Wo dometɔ eve aɖewo lé eƒe ŋku
You can see what’s going on here.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusi le edzi yim le afisia.
Throw everything in our path.	Tsɔ nusianu ƒu gbe le míaƒe mɔ dzi.
I wonder how long that will last	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɣeyiɣi didi kae ema anɔ anyi hã
Now turn to me.	Azɔ trɔ ɖe ŋunye.
And it did work.	Eye ewɔ dɔ nyateƒe.
None of them are happy with the status quo.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe nɔnɔme si li fifia ŋu o.
I got into the waiting	Meva nɔ lalam la me
We don’t know each other.	Míenya mía nɔewo o.
I can’t stand being in the same room as you	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi anɔ xɔ ɖeka me kple wò o
That’s what he wants.	Emae nye nusi dim wòle.
We can’t do everything in one day.	Míate ŋu awɔ nusianu le ŋkeke ɖeka me o.
I couldn’t do this to him	Nyemete ŋu wɔ esia ɖe eŋu o
I can’t answer them all	Nyemate ŋu aɖo wo katã ŋu o
It isn’t either.	Mele nenema hã o.
But it would be annoying.	Gake anye nusi ado dziku na ame.
I can’t give up now	Nyemate ŋu ana ta fifia o
I loved what we could have together	Nusi míate ŋu anɔ anyi ɖekae la dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
You have my point on that.	Nye nya le asiwò le ema ŋu.
I was too sick to remember	Medze dɔ akpa be nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi o
They were so excited.	Dzi dzɔ wo ale gbegbe.
Nothing is against it.	Naneke metsi tre ɖe eŋu o.
But you are the one.	Gake wòe nye ɖeka.
He has a room in his own house.	Xɔ aɖe le eya ŋutɔ ƒe aƒe me.
I will continue alone from here	Nye ɖeka mayi edzi tso afisia
I was worried about you the whole time	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò ɣeyiɣi bliboa katã
Everything.	Nu sia nu.
It didn’t take my life.	Meɖe nye agbe ɖa o.
He doesn’t deserve someone like him.	Medze na ame aɖe abe eya ene o.
I exalted myself to him	Medo ɖokuinye ɖe dzi nɛ
I think people who really want them have them.	Mesusu be wo le ame siwo di wo ŋutɔŋutɔ la si.
Everything went well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
It never needed to surprise anyone.	Mehiã be wòawɔ nuku na ame aɖeke kpɔ o.
I felt really weird out there	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ le afima
A heart with two names	Dzi si me ŋkɔ eve le
This is an old town with old money.	Esia nye du xoxo aɖe si me ga xoxo le.
I don’t think it’s our dog.	Nyemesusu be míaƒe avu ye o.
He would tell her everything was fine between them.	Agblɔ nɛ be nusianu nɔ nyuie le wo dome.
I can’t stand anyone	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe ame aɖeke gbɔ o
Stick his head inside.	Tsɔ eƒe ta ƒo ɖe eme.
It was too quick.	Ewɔ kaba akpa.
I really couldn’t be happier for them	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ wu ema na wo o
There’s something here for everyone.	Nane le afisia na amesiame.
I enjoy making them	Wo wɔwɔ dzɔa dzi nam
There will be money somewhere.	Ga anɔ afi aɖe.
I think there was something else involved	Mesusu be nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ eme
It was a long time ago.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si va yi.
He couldn’t bear it.	Mete ŋu do dzi o.
It’s not an opportunity.	Menye mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖee o.
I would definitely tell him that	Magblɔ nya ma nɛ godoo
That’s a problem.	Ema nye kuxi.
No one said too much.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya geɖe akpa o.
Maybe that will help you	Ðewohĩ ema akpe ɖe ŋuwò
All of them, all of them, all of them.	Wo katã, wo katã, wo katã.
I used to like him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam tsã.
This was going to work.	Esia nɔ dɔ wɔ ge.
I got a call from the police this morning	Kpovitɔwo ƒo ka nam ŋdi sia
Here, the winner was a bit more surprising.	Le afisia la, amesi ɖu dzi la wɔ nuku vie wu.
If anything had changed.	Ne ɖe nane trɔ le eŋu la.
I needed to be where people were	Ehiã be manɔ afisi amewo le
He never put anything out there for her.	Metsɔ naneke da ɖe afima nɛ kpɔ o.
Perhaps in another way.	Ðewohĩ le mɔ bubu nu.
I set off two days ago.	Medze mɔ ŋkeke eve enye sia.
However, only a few people.	Ke hã, ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe.
They’re really onto something here.	Wole nane dzi le afisia ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You have some people coming up.	Ame aɖewo le asiwò siwo gbɔna.
Which is the closest thing.	Nusi nye nusi te ɖe eŋu.
I don’t believe that	Nyemeka ɖe nya ma dzi o
Nothing for that now.	Naneke meli na ema fifia o.
There’s a lot of opportunity here.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe le afisia.
But I wanted to do more.	Gake medi be mawɔ geɖe wu.
I do this over and over again	Mewɔa esia zi gbɔ zi geɖe
So far it has been easy enough.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ele bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
There was no room in your life for anything else, or anyone.	Teƒe menɔ wò agbe me na nu bubu aɖeke o, alo ame aɖeke o.
I really don’t think anything happened between us	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemesusu be naneke dzɔ le mía dome o
I enjoy doing this challenge.	Kuxi sia wɔwɔ doa dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But my mind is still drawn to that bygone day.	Gake nye susu gakpɔtɔ le ŋkeke ma si va yi me.
People told me it was amazing.	Amewo gblɔ nam be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
For some reason, that made me feel better.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, ema na nye dzi dze eme.
There was nothing as far as the eye could see.	Naneke menɔ anyi afisi ŋku ate ŋu akpɔ o.
Please offer any help.	Taflatse do kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe ɖa.
I want to know everything about it	Medi be manya nusianu tso eŋu
His mind threw himself into it.	Eƒe susu ƒu gbe ɖe eme.
I am just another man	Ŋutsu bubu aɖe koe menye
Next years together.	Ƒe siwo gbɔna ɖekae.
I know it’s true in a way.	Menya be enye nyateƒe le mɔ aɖe nu.
I asked a few questions	Mebia nya ʋɛ aɖewo
I treated him the same way	Mewɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu nenema ke
Mado go.	Mado go.
Can anyone help me.	Ðe ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
I am here for you now	Mele afisia na wò fifia
This means money.	Esia fia ga.
This is on one side.	Esia le akpa ɖeka.
It really is that simple.	Ele bɔbɔe nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I hope everyone else does the same	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã nawɔ nenema ke
But he got tired after a week or two.	Gake ɖeɖi te eŋu le kwasiɖa ɖeka alo eve megbe.
I think that’s great for him	Mesusu be ema nyo nɛ ŋutɔ
I would be very happy	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
I hope to continue working with them	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mayi edzi anɔ dɔ wɔm kpli wo
Money changed it.	Ga trɔ asi le eŋu.
I will get out of that very soon.	Mado le ema me kpuie ŋutɔ.
I want to be like him, but no way.	Medi be manɔ abe eya ene, gake mɔ aɖeke meli o.
And the water, too.	Eye tsi la hã.
There are two reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo li siwo tae.
A new school.	Suku yeye aɖe.
But I really didn’t mind	Gake le nyateƒe me la, meɖe fu nam o
I reached for the rope	Medo asi ɖe ka la gbɔ
And it could happen again.	Eye ate ŋu adzɔ ake.
Maybe he’ll see them, maybe he won’t.	Ðewohĩ akpɔ wo, ɖewohĩ makpɔ wo o.
I will probably do the same thing this year.	Anɔ eme be mawɔ nenema ke le ƒe sia me hã.
I will always be here	Manɔ afisia ɣesiaɣi
I had to be there for that	Ele be manɔ afima ɖe ema ta
Something changed in his character.	Nane trɔ le eƒe nɔnɔme me.
I didn’t have any money.	Ga aɖeke menɔ asinye o.
But something changed.	Gake nane trɔ.
This point is very important, and not very important.	Nya sia le vevie ŋutɔ, eye mele vevie ŋutɔ hã o.
In fact, I was the only one who was happy	Le nyateƒe me la, nye ɖeka koe nye dzi dze eme
I hope you enjoyed it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be edzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ
A fun little thing	Nu sue aɖe si doa dzidzɔ na ame
I really want to see what you have	Medi vevie be makpɔ nusi le asiwò
They have someone else here.	Ame bubu aɖe le wo si le afisia.
He had no idea what was going on here.	Menya nusi nɔ edzi yim le afisia o.
And perhaps there are a couple of reasons for that.	Eye ɖewohĩ susu eve aɖewo li siwo tae wòle nenema ɖo.
I think this is being handled behind the scenes	Mesusu be wole esia gbɔ kpɔm le megbe
He wouldn’t have expected anything else.	Anye ne makpɔ mɔ na nu bubu aɖeke o.
I had to stay up all night	Ele be manɔ ŋu zã bliboa katã

But this time is different.	Gake ɣeyiɣi sia ya to vovo.
We just know that many of us used to be.	Ðeko míenya be mía dometɔ geɖe nɔ anyi tsã.
This kind of thing is beautiful.	Nu sia ƒomevi nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.

It’s not here either.	Mele afisia hã o.
Years passed by.	Ƒe aɖewo va yi.
And you can’t continue either.	Eye màte ŋu ayi edzi hã o.
And it’s no wonder why.	Eye mewɔ nuku o be nukatae.
I must have had them there	Wo anya nɔ asinye le afima
However, that may not be what you want.	Ke hã, ɖewohĩ menye emae nèdi o.
I don’t know what I’m looking for here.	Nyemenya nusi dim mele le afisia o.
But without a date, the project may never be finished.	Gake ŋkeke aɖeke manɔmee la, ɖewohĩ dɔa nu mayi gbeɖe o.

But this is good.	Gake esia nyo.
Clearly, I am doing something wrong.	Edze ƒã be mele nu gbegblẽ aɖe wɔm.
I am not any other way	Nyemele mɔ bubu aɖeke nu o
He won’t find anything on it.	Makpɔ naneke le edzi o.
It can come upon us all at once.	Ate ŋu ava mía dzi zi ɖeka.
We don’t have one thing.	Nu ɖeka aɖeke mele mía si o.
I thought he felt the same way, but he didn’t	Mesusu be eya hã se le eɖokui me nenema ke, gake mese le eɖokui me o
If not, get over it.	Ne menye nenema o la, ke ɖu edzi.
I just want to be alone, guess what	Ðeko medi be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi, bu eŋu kpɔ
I was about to bleed	Menɔ ʋu ɖe ge

He didn’t let me.	Meɖe mɔ nam o.
This is enough for me	Esia sɔ gbɔ nam

These ideas did not work well.	Susu siawo mewɔ dɔ nyuie o.

Again, it doesn’t matter.	Le go ma me hã la, mehiã o.

No one could find him.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.

Some of this stuff is really, really good.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖewo nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t want to talk about that	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu o
Maybe he would like me to know.	Ðewohĩ adi be manya.
I think there might be something wrong with you.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ nane gblẽ le ŋuwò.
I look forward to meeting them	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be mado go wo
I was a little angry with him	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu vie
Just a stone or two there.	Kpe ɖeka alo eve ko le afima.
You’ll be very excited.	Adzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ.
I have to be working	Ele be manɔ dɔ wɔm
I felt my face but couldn’t hear anything	Mese nye mo gake nyemete ŋu se naneke o
I want it to impress me, now	Medi be wòawɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye, fifia
And this is amazing.	Eye esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But it was only temporary.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖe koe wònye.
You can live without it.	Àte ŋu anɔ agbe ema manɔmee.
That he can’t do it.	Be mate ŋu awɔ o.
He will go home.	Ayi aƒeme.
You can’t give up.	Màte ŋu ana ta o.
Stay here for a few days.	Nɔ afisia ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo.
I have a reason to live now	Susu aɖe le asinye be manɔ agbe fifia
He is not looking for them.	Menye wo dim wòle o.
Food is life.	Nuɖuɖu nye agbe.
A very interesting man	Ŋutsu aɖe si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ
But he couldn't say anything.	Gake mete ŋu gblɔ naneke o.
It was the perfect place.	Enye teƒe si sɔ nyuie.
I know he was surprised	Menya be ewɔ nuku nɛ
He understood nothing of himself.	Mese naneke gɔme tso eɖokui ŋu o.
I can’t tell you everything	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya sia nya na wò o
I fought to keep working.	Mewɔ avu be mayi edzi anɔ dɔ wɔm.
And they tried it.	Eye wo to eŋu kpɔ.
I have to get out of here	Ele nam be mado le afisia
Maybe it will be easier for people.	Ðewohĩ anɔ bɔbɔe na amewo wu.
Again, this is just this week.	Le afisia hã la, kwasiɖa sia koe nye esia.
Time for me to go.	Ɣeyiɣi si me mayi.
Maybe I need more time.	Ðewohĩ mehiã ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu.
And maybe it makes sense.	Eye ɖewohĩ susu le eme.
I had to do something else	Ele be mawɔ nu bubu aɖe hã
I don’t know what that means	Nyemenya nusi ema fia o
He had never seen anything like it.	Mekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
This is not necessary to do.	Esia wɔwɔ mehiã o.
I was very impressed with him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ.
None of it makes sense.	Susu mele wo dometɔ aɖeke me o.
Not sure what to make of it.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi woawɔ tso eŋu dzi o.
I have to go home though	Ele be mayi aƒeme gake
I will also see others who were present.	Makpɔ ame bubu siwo nɔ anyi hã.
She has long shapely legs.	Eƒe afɔ didi siwo ƒe nɔnɔme le nɔnɔme nyui me.
Look at your head.	Lé ŋku ɖe wò ta ŋu.
I did that with you today	Mewɔ nu ma kpli wò egbea
There was a lot of work with little time.	Dɔ geɖe nɔ anyi si me ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke menɔ o.
That didn’t bother me either	Ema hã meɖe fu nam o
This is a strange thing.	Esia nye nusi mewɔ nuku o.
That is the state of our heart.	Emae nye míaƒe dzi ƒe nɔnɔme.
Clearly we missed something.	Edze ƒã be nane to mía ŋu.
He didn’t like it.	Eƒe nu medze eŋu o.
I want to bring everything together	Medi be maƒo nusianu nu ƒu ɖekae
There were many results from this	Nu geɖe do tso esia me
It was a difficult time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe.
I can’t accept this.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nya sia o.
To my surprise, there was still money there.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ be ga gakpɔtɔ nɔ afima.
But there is always something.	Gake nane nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi.
I actually like this arrangement	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖoɖo sia dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
None of them could help him.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mete ŋu kpe ɖe eŋu o.
I am ready to give that up	Mele klalo be maɖe asi le ema ŋu
He didn’t care what came before.	Metsɔ ɖeke le nusi va do ŋgɔ me o.
I can’t get out of the car	Nyemate ŋu ado le ʋua me o
That’s closer, though .	Ema te ɖe eŋu wu, gake .
But it’s not the same thing.	Gake menye nu ɖeka ma ke o.
In my mind, this couldn’t be worse.	Le nye susu me la, esia mate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ wu ema o.
My point is simple.	Nye nya la le bɔbɔe.
What do you think?.	Nukae nèsusu?.
I have been here many times	Meva afisia zi geɖe
, when police arrived.	, esime kpovitɔwo va ɖo.
Finally, someone picked up.	Mlɔeba la, ame aɖe fɔ nu.
I can’t promise you what he was promising you	Nyemate ŋu ado nusi ƒe ŋugbe wònɔ dom na wò la ŋugbe o
It was another city.	Du bubu aɖee wònye.
But something finally came.	Gake nane va mlɔeba.
The present case, however, is quite different.	Gake nya si le edzi yim fifia ya to vovo kura.
I needed real food soon	Meva hiã nuɖuɖu ŋutɔŋutɔ kpuie
I needed help	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu
I am not going to emphasize this.	Nyemele nya sia dzi ƒom o.
I can’t be in two places at once	Nyemate ŋu anɔ teƒe eve zi ɖeka o
I pretended not to hear them	Mewɔ abe ɖe nyemese wo o ene
Anyone other than me.	Ame sia ame si menye nye o.
I hope everyone is having a wonderful day.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be amesiame le ŋkeke nyui aɖe dzi kpɔm.
I knew it wouldn’t make any sense	Menya be susu aɖeke manɔ eme o
After a year, you can.	Le ƒe ɖeka megbe la, àte ŋu.
This is disturbing.	Esia ɖe fu na ame.
I will be ready.	Manɔ klalo.
I think they are probably working here now	Mesusu be anɔ eme be wole dɔ wɔm le afisia fifia
I want to say he doesn’t understand	Medi be magblɔ be mese egɔme o
That made sense, too.	Susu nɔ nya ma hã me.
But we are coping well.	Gake míele te ɖe enu nyuie.
I wanted to fight.	Medi be mawɔ avu.
It has worked before.	Ewɔ dɔ kpɔ.
It could have been a good book.	Ate ŋu anye agbalẽ nyui aɖe hafi.
I found someone different	Mekpɔ ame aɖe si to vovo
I am ready to go now.	Mele klalo be mayi fifia.
Everything was working fine.	Nusianu nɔ dɔ wɔm nyuie.
I want to know what is important to you.	Medi be manya nu si le vevie na wò.
But this is a little more than that for me.	Gake esia sɔ gbɔ wu ema vie nam.
And, and, and.	Eye, kple, kple.
Get closer to it.	Te ɖe eŋu.
In fact, it is his only way.	Le nyateƒe me la, eya koe nye eƒe mɔ.
I will need to test that out.	Ahiã be mado ema kpɔ.
A lot has happened to me though	Nu geɖe dzɔ ɖe dzinye gake
I really don’t understand	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemese egɔme o
You are so much like him.	Èle abe eya ene ale gbegbe.
I just want to have some time	Ðeko medi be ɣeyiɣi aɖe nanɔ asinye
I want space for me.	Medi be manɔ teƒe nam.
I need to see you soon	Ehiã be makpɔ wò kpuie
I like that kind of thing.	Nu ma ƒomevi dzɔa dzi nam.
He had something of this in life.	Esia ƒe nane nɔ esi le agbe me.
He will be waiting for them.	Anɔ wo lalam.
I don’t know what to do.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
But I can only see parts	Gake akpa aɖewo koe mate ŋu akpɔ
Thank you so much for that.	Akpe geɖe na wò ɖe ema ta.
But nothing touched me.	Gake naneke meka asi ŋunye o.
I have to move on	Ele nam be mayi ŋgɔ
That afternoon.	Le ŋdɔ ma me.
I don’t know what happened to him after that	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi le ema megbe o
I didn’t know what to say to him.	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ nɛ o.
There is something different about them.	Nane to vovo le wo ŋu.
Every last one of them.	Wo dometɔ mamlɛtɔ ɖesiaɖe.
This is simply not possible.	Ðeko esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
He is doing well now.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie fifia.
Desire is more personal than desire	Didi nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ wu didi
I want this to be legal	Medi be esia nanɔ se nu
I'm on them.	Mele wo dzi.
And it is so.	Eye ele nenema.
I knew exactly what was going through his mind.	Menya nusi tututu nɔ eƒe susu me tom.
That is.	Ema nye.
They were very interesting to me.	Wo do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
I hoped it wouldn’t bother him	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be maɖe fu nɛ o
Who was with him.	Ame si nɔ eŋu nɛ.
I couldn’t stand it	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o
I don’t want to meet any of these people	Nyemedi be mado go ame siawo dometɔ aɖeke o
Neither is a dog or cat, for that matter.	Avu alo avu hã menye nenema o, le nya ma ta.
Which is more than excellent.	Nusi wu nyuie wu.
I wondered how long he had been waiting for us	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɣeyiɣi didi kae wònɔ mía lalam hã
It never happened.	Meva eme gbeɖe o.
Now neither seems to want the job.	Fifia edze abe wo dometɔ aɖeke medi dɔa o ene.
That sums it up for my personal life.	Ema ƒo nu tso eŋu kpuie na nye ŋutɔ nye agbe.
Almost no one did that.	Ame aɖeke kloe mewɔ nu ma o.
And this is a new thing.	Eye esia nye nu yeye.
I will keep waiting	Mayi edzi anɔ lalam
It doesn’t seem cheap.	Edze abe mexɔ asi o ene.
This is not an impossible task.	Esia menye dɔ si mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Which makes sense, actually.	Nusi me susu le, le nyateƒe me.
However there is one exception.	Ke hã ɖeka aɖe li si to vovo.
I know this is true of me.	Menya be esia nye nyateƒe le ŋunye.
I wondered the same question all night	Mebia nya ma ke ɖokuinye zã bliboa katã
I hope it works out well	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ nyuie
Years have passed.	Ƒe geɖe va yi.
I tried to stay focused	Medze agbagba be nye susu nanɔ dɔ dzi
I had to stay strong	Ele be manɔ anyi sesĩe
He did not want anyone else to treat him.	Medi be ame bubu aɖeke nawɔ nu ɖe ​​ye ŋu o.
I did the same thing	Nye hã mewɔe nenema ke
It is impossible at all.	Manya wɔ kura o.
And that’s a good thing.	Eye ema nye nu nyui aɖe.
We are in the.	Míele le.
I made a date with him	Meɖo gbe ɖi kplii
Maybe I did that.	Ðewohĩ mewɔe nenema.
It will be my last.	Anye nye mamlɛtɔ.
I know this sounds weird, but think about it	Menya be esia ɖi nusi mewɔ nuku o, gake bu eŋu kpɔ
Prices are always going up.	Nuwo ƒe asi le dzi yim ɣesiaɣi.
I can’t help it though	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o ke hã
I’m sick, I can’t do anything, I’m all in it	Medze dɔ, nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o, nye nusianu le eme
I couldn’t care less.	Nyemete ŋu tsɔ ɖeke nɛ o.
I want to live.	Medi be manɔ agbe.
I have never seen anything like this in my life	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene le nye agbe me kpɔ o
I told him a partial truth	Megblɔ nyateƒe ƒe akpa aɖe nɛ
I couldn’t find some things	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe nu aɖewo ŋu o
This is why our timing is so important.	Esia tae míaƒe ɣeyiɣi ɖoɖo le vevie ŋutɔ ɖo.
This will make your life much easier.	Esia ana wò agbe nanɔ bɔbɔe na wò ŋutɔ.
I want to move on with my life	Medi be mayi nye agbe dzi
But in the end.	Gake mlɔeba la.
I borrowed more stuff.	Medo nu geɖe wu.
I said I apologized so many times	Megblɔ be meɖe kuku zi geɖe ale gbegbe
This is applicable to everyone.	Esia sɔ na amesiame.
My heart was racing.	Nye dzi xɔ dzo.
It doesn’t matter now, anyway.	Mehiã fifia o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I just threw it all up	Ðeko metsɔ wo katã ƒu gbe ɖe dzi
And no one came to fruition.	Eye ame aɖeke hã meva eme o.
I just can’t do it.	Ðeko nyemate ŋui o.
I made myself at home	Mewɔ ɖokuinye le aƒeme
I am sure things will be fine	Meka ɖe edzi be nuwo anyo
Someone believed me.	Ame aɖe xɔ dzinye se.
But, it happened.	Gake, edzɔ.
I told him everything	Megblɔ nya sia nya nɛ
I am here with these few on a matter of some importance.	Mele afisia kple ame ʋɛ siawo le nya aɖe si le vevie aɖe ŋu.
I was a huge challenge.	Menye kuxi gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I know right from wrong too	Nye hã menya nu nyui kple nu gbegblẽ
I can’t fight in this	Nyemate ŋu awɔ avu le esia me o
He was satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme.
Book at least two days in advance.	Wɔ agbalẽ ŋkeke eve ya teti do ŋgɔ.
It worked out very well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
A job that only you can do	Dɔ si wò ɖeka koe ate ŋu awɔ
I don’t know if that’s the only reason.	Nyemenya nenye be ema koe nye susu si tae o.
I think maybe you should join him	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ele be nàwɔ ɖeka kplii
And it used to be that way.	Eye wònɔ nenema tsã hã.
However, this is not obvious.	Ke hã, esia medze ƒã o.
I know it’s the same for you	Menya be nenema ke wòle na wò hã
This is very difficult.	Esia sesẽ ŋutɔ.
It’s not a big city.	Menye du gã aɖee wònye o.
I never wanted a big house	Nyemedi aƒe gã aɖeke kpɔ o
But he couldn’t talk.	Gake mete ŋu ƒoa nu o.
But there has to be money in it.	Gake ele be ga nanɔ eme.
I think a lot of us struggle with that.	Mesusu be mía dometɔ geɖe wɔa avu kple ema.
Working there.	Le dɔ wɔm le afima.
Or he used to be.	Alo wònɔ tsã.
It’s just not there.	Ðeko mele afima o.
I’m glad you liked this.	Edzɔ dzi nam be esia dze ŋuwò.
I don’t think it matters.	Nyemesusu be mele vevie o.
I'm sure of it.	Meka ɖe edzi.
I don't mean to command you from	Menye ɖe meɖoe be maɖe gbe na wò tso
Please enter your name.	Taflatse ŋlɔ wò ŋkɔ.
But you are the present.	Gake wòe nye ame si li fifia.
I told him he needed more people	Megblɔ nɛ be ehiã ame geɖe wu
But he never liked it.	Gake medze eŋu gbeɖe o.
Had he ever done the same for her.	Ðe wòwɔ nenema ke nɛ kpɔa.
At appropriate times.	Le ɣeyiɣi siwo sɔ me.
I promise you everything will be fine	Medo ŋugbe na mi be nusianu anyo
I need to be able to control them	Ele be mate ŋu aɖu wo dzi
I have a job for him	Dɔ aɖe le asinye nɛ
I do everything for you	Mewɔa nusianu na wò
I fought long and hard for that	Mewɔ avu ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe vevie ɖe ema ta
That will take at least a week or two.	Ema axɔ kwasiɖa ɖeka alo eve ya teti.
And what is so wrong with this.	Eye nukae gblẽ le esia ŋu ale gbegbe.
I had a wonderful morning	Mekpɔ ŋdi nyui aɖe
I think it might still be a bit busy	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ vovo manɔ eŋu vie kokoko
But not for long.	Gake menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
That’s pretty simple.	Ema le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
And that’s not his place to do that.	Eye menye emae nye eƒe teƒe si wòawɔ ema o.
Not in the process.	Menye le dɔa wɔwɔ me o.
Not wanting anything else.	Menye nu bubu aɖeke didi o.
This is strange and he clearly has something working for him.	Esia wɔ nuku eye edze ƒã be nane le dɔ wɔm nɛ.
I thought there might be another good book in this town.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ agbalẽ nyui bubu aɖe anɔ du sia me.
This is no small task.	Esia menye dɔ sue aɖeke o.
I must have you now	Ele be wò nanɔ asinye fifia
It wasn’t working, of course.	Menɔ dɔ wɔm o ya.
I could be there in an hour	Mate ŋu anɔ afima le gaƒoƒo ɖeka megbe
I’m not free.	Vovo mele ŋunye o.
I kind of doubted it.	Meke ɖi le eŋu le mɔ aɖe nu.
I know, it’s amazing	Menya, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ
It was never real, of course.	Menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o ya.
You will get bored after a day.	Ate ɖeɖi ŋuwò le ŋkeke ɖeka megbe.
It’s nothing more than that.	Menye naneke wu ema o.
I put my hand out his way	Medo nye asi ɖe eƒe mɔ dzi
It could have been the same thing for me.	Ate ŋu anye nu ma ke nam hafi.
He couldn’t allow that.	Mete ŋu ɖe mɔ nenema o.
It should work for you.	Ele be wòawɔ dɔ na wò.
I just want to keep going	Ðeko medi be mayi edzi
There is no car.	Ʋu aɖeke meli o.
I tried to relax a little	Medze agbagba be maɖe dzi ɖi vie
I like a lot of the same things	Nu geɖe siwo sɔ la dzɔa dzi nam
Now they are working fine.	Fifia wole dɔ wɔm nyuie.
Something must be wrong.	Ele be nane gblẽ.
And this is one of them.	Eye esia nye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
You are the person in charge.	Wòe nye ame si le dɔa dzi kpɔm.
I just sat tired and exhausted	Ðeko wònɔ anyi ɖeɖi te ŋunye eye ɖeɖi te ŋunye
I was actually planning on doing that myself	Le nyateƒe me la, nye ŋutɔ menɔ ɖoɖo wɔm ɖe ema wɔwɔ ŋu
No food for two days	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke manɔ anyi ŋkeke eve o
He had never felt that way about anyone.	Mese le eɖokui me nenema le ame aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o.
I didn’t see them after that	Nyemekpɔ wo le ema megbe o
I am working on a few myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mele dɔ wɔm tso wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋu.
I acted impossibly	Mewɔ nu le mɔ si mate ŋu adzɔ o nu
I had to figure out something real quick.	Ele nam be makpɔ nane ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋu kaba.
I didn’t mean to be here.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mava afisia o.

I don’t know what happened	Nyemenya nu si dzɔ o

Part of my mind told me	Nye susu ƒe akpa aɖe gblɔ nam

I have to see you every morning and every night	Ele be makpɔ wò ŋdi sia ŋdi kple zã sia zã
Our work solves this problem.	Míaƒe dɔa kpɔa kuxi sia gbɔ.
I can’t remember about that	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nya ma ŋu nya dzi o
I'm not sure that's quite right either.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be nya ma hã sɔ tututu o.
Stay on your path.	Nɔ wò mɔ dzi.
And it’s not like that.	Eye menye alea o.
I wasn’t very happy	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ o
Clearly, something was seriously wrong.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ le eŋu vevie.
And maybe that’s a good thing.	Eye ɖewohĩ nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
Consider where we are now.	Bu afi si míele fifia ŋu kpɔ.

A voice spoke to him	Gbe aɖe ƒo nu nɛ
He was a good guy.	Ame nyui aɖee wònye.
I know this is hard for you	Menya be esia sesẽ na wò
I was just impressed.	Ðeko wòwɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.

He worked hard.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe.
I met him the night before.	Medo go le zã si do ŋgɔ me.
I just heard it.	Ðeko mese.
Honestly, I knew what I was going to see.	Le nyateƒe me la, menya nusi makpɔ.
Some things have improved.	Nu aɖewo va nyo ɖe edzi.
This is working well.	Esia le dɔ wɔm nyuie.
Ask us for everything.	Bia nu sia nu na mí.
There is a big hole in that law.	Do gã aɖe le se ma me.
But his work is a necessary one.	Gake eƒe dɔa nye dɔ si hiã.
I think it would be a wonderful help	Mesusu be anye kpekpeɖeŋu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ
I thought he escaped, but he was just a kid	Mesusu be esi, gake ɖevi aɖe koe wònye
Something is really wrong.	Nane gblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I'll see you soon.	Makpɔ wò kpuie.
I’m not here to do that.	Menye ɖe mele afisia be mawɔ ema o.

Tell him that.	Gblɔ nya ma nɛ.

A car stops, and a man gets out	Ʋu aɖe tɔ, eye ŋutsu aɖe ɖi
He is giving them too much time.	Ele ɣeyiɣi geɖe nam wo akpa.
Or make time.	Alo wɔ ɣeyiɣi.
It’s not a job or a job.	Menye dɔ alo dɔ aɖee wònye o.
Very very difficult.	Sesẽ ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.

Everyone was on the job.	Amesiame nɔ dɔa dzi.

Again, use common sense.	Le afisia hã la, zã susu nyui.

No one could get past him.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu to eŋu o.
It was just there.	Ðeko wònɔ afima.
I liked everything about it.	Nusianu si ku ɖe eŋu la dzɔ dzi nam.
But in some cases.	Gake le go aɖewo me la.
I was, and still am, nervous	Metsi dzodzodzoe, eye megale nenema kokoko
I knew it was one of his crazy ideas	Menya be enye eƒe susu siwo me susu mele o la dometɔ ɖeka
No one will step up.	Ame aɖeke maɖe afɔ o.
He has a job to do.	Dɔ le esi wòle be wòawɔ.
That would have been something real.	Ema anye nane ŋutɔŋutɔ hafi.
I finally did it.	Mewɔe mlɔeba.
It is working now.	Ele dɔ wɔm fifia.
That was two years ago now.	Ema nye ƒe eve enye sia fifia.
It is important to plan for this. 	Ele vevie be nàwɔ ɖoɖo ɖe esia ŋu. 
He’s focused on things.	Eƒe susu nɔa nu ŋu.
I put my hand on my neck	Metsɔ nye asi ɖo nye kɔ ŋu
I thought it would give me some time to myself.	Mesusu be ana ɣeyiɣi aɖe nam le ɖokuinye me.
The issue is deeper than that.	Nya la de to wu ema.
It was too quick.	Ewɔ kaba akpa.
I should have called you sooner	Ðe wòle be maƒo ka na wò kaba hafi
I didn’t expect to see you here.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be makpɔ wò le afisia o.
Quite the opposite.	Nusi to vovo kura na ema.
But think about it.	Gake bu eŋu kpɔ.
I would really appreciate it if you could help me	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ne àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye
I wanted to see for myself what was going on	Medi be nye ŋutɔ makpɔ nusi le edzi yim
I know you so well	Menya wò nyuie ale gbegbe
In another order.	Le ɖoɖo bubu me.
I want to say thank you for that	Medi be magblɔ be akpe na mi ɖe ema ta
I see what’s going on here	Mekpɔ nusi le edzi yim le afisia
That won’t solve anything.	Ema makpɔ naneke gbɔ o.
There are so many great things here.	Nu gã geɖe ŋutɔ le afisia.
Clearly, there is much work to be done.	Edze ƒã be dɔ geɖe li woawɔ.
I need to know where he is, if he is alive	Ele nam be manya afi si wòle, nenye be ele agbe
I promise to explain what happened here	Medo ŋugbe be maɖe nusi dzɔ le afisia me
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Perhaps some others were.	Ðewohĩ ame bubu aɖewo hã nɔ nenema.
Everything had been so exciting.	Nusianu do dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ tsã.
I heard that name	Mese ŋkɔ ma
I’m glad you’re here!.	Edzɔ dzi nam be èle afisia!.
I have met them all.	Medo go wo katã kpɔ.
He didn’t take anything from her.	Mexɔ naneke le esi o.
That was none of his business.	Ema menye eƒe nya aɖeke o.
In fact, he did the exact opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo kura na emae wòwɔ.
I can’t say the same for myself	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma ke na ɖokuinye o
I actually like this place a lot.	Le nyateƒe me la, teƒe sia dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I heard about it years later	Mese nu tso eŋu le ƒe aɖewo megbe
I was nervous which was normal	Metsi dzodzodzoe si nye nusi sɔ
Should have done more with it	Ðe wòle be woawɔ geɖe wu kplii hafi
I know all is well with him	Menya be nuwo katã le edzi dzem nɛ
I couldn’t understand it for years	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme o ƒe geɖe
Why, we don’t know, but that really doesn’t matter at this point.	Nukatae, míenya o, gake le nyateƒe me la, ema mele vevie le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
I tried to imagine what that must be like	Medze agbagba be makpɔ alesi wòle be ema nanɔ le susu me
I was curious to know	Medi vevie be manya
He had never been in one.	Menɔ ɖeka me kpɔ o.
I can’t tell you what you should do	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi wòle be nàwɔ o
I don’t think he’s great at any one thing.	Nyemesusu be enye gã le nu ɖeka aɖeke me o.
He hasn’t done it yet.	Mewɔe haɖe o.
Too difficult a task.	Dɔ si sesẽ akpa.
They are important.	Wole vevie.
So far, no problems.	Vaseɖe fifia la, kuxi aɖeke meli o.
I don’t think we can keep going down that path	Mesusu be míate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ mɔ ma dzi yim o
In his head.	Le eƒe ta me.
He’s got a smile on his face.	Eƒe lãme xɔ dzo.
This is a very convenient path for you.	Esia nye mɔ si sɔ na wò ŋutɔ.
He didn’t know the right words.	Menya nya siwo sɔ o.
Check things out.	Kpɔ nuwo ɖa.
In fact, it’s quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo kura.
I am very convinced of that.	Meka ɖe nya ma dzi ŋutɔ.
It will take something from you.	Axɔ nane le asiwò.
I felt like it was part of me	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe nye akpa aɖee wònye ene
It never worked, of course.	Mewɔ dɔ kpɔ o ya.
I couldn’t do it for him	Nyemete ŋu wɔe nɛ o
In fact, it would make good sense.	Le nyateƒe me la, susu nyui anɔ eme.
I had to get it all out, tonight	Ele nam be maɖe wo katã ɖa, le zã sia me
I look forward to the day when this will all be over	Mekpɔ mɔ na ŋkeke si dzi esia katã awu enu
It’s amazing, actually.	Ewɔ nuku, le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It couldn’t have come at a better time.	Mate ŋu ava le ɣeyiɣi si nyo wu me hafi o.
I don’t know if this works or not.	Nyemenya ne esia wɔa dɔ alo mewɔa dɔ o.
I wonder what is behind that room	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae le megbe na xɔ ma hã
Someone else did the same.	Ame bubu aɖe hã wɔe nenema.
I am the law and order here	Nyee nye se kple ɖoɖo le afisia
I thought he would talk about it	Mesusu be aƒo nu tso eŋu
Maybe it’s here.	Ðewohĩ ele afisia.
They are not la.	Di ga la.
This time, this episode is a little different.	Fifia ya, akpa sia to vovo vie.
I could never get there	Nyemete ŋu ɖo afima gbeɖe o
I can’t keep acting like all is well	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ nu wɔm abe ɖe nuwo katã le nyuie ene o
So far, none of them have had any problems.	Vaseɖe fifia la, kuxi aɖeke menɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o.
As a result, there are two sides.	Esia wɔe be akpa eve va ɖo.
He was really surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Perhaps it is true that there is nothing to do.	Ðewohĩ enye nyateƒe be naneke meli woawɔ o.
I’ve done it twice now	Mewɔe zi eve fifia
I just want to see what it looks like now	Ðeko medi be makpɔ alesi wòle fifia
That was a very clear deadline.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi mamlɛtɔ si me kɔ ŋutɔ.
To my surprise, it worked	Ewɔ nuku nam be ewɔ dɔ
There’s a part of me there too	Nye akpa aɖe hã le afima
I don’t want to hit you	Nyemedi be maƒo wò o
There is only one month and there will be another.	Ɣleti ɖeka koe li eye bubu hã anɔ anyi.
It will work the same way.	Awɔ dɔ nenema ke.
I will have to fight	Ahiã be mawɔ avu
I reached one extreme.	Meɖo nu ɖeka si gbɔ eme me.
In any other case.	Le nɔnɔme bubu ɖesiaɖe me.
I just put my head down and worked.	Ðeko metsɔ nye ta ɖo anyi eye mewɔ dɔ.
But, that was a bit overwhelming.	Gake, ema xɔ aƒe ɖe ame me vie.
I believed in him, and I insisted.	Mexɔ edzi se, eye mete tɔ ɖe edzi.
It’s a plan of his.	Eƒe ɖoɖo aɖee.
I'm just curious about your reasons	Ðeko medi vevie be manya susu siwo tae nèle
From this point of view.	Tso nya sia me.
But some people survived.	Gake ame aɖewo tsi agbe.
An idea struck me.	Susu aɖe va dze dzinye.
That wasn’t that long ago.	Ema menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia o.
Not for a long time.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
There is none of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
Part of your job	Wò dɔa ƒe akpa aɖe
That can be exhausting.	Ema ate ŋu ate ɖeɖi ame ŋu.
I had to see what happened to him	Ele be makpɔ nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi
This, of course, means two things.	Esia fia nu eve aɖewo ya.
Like yesterday’s work.	Abe etsɔ ƒe dɔ ene.
We can’t give up.	Míate ŋu ana ta o.
I have been wanting since past few days	Medi vevie tso ŋkeke ʋɛ siwo va yi me
And so are some of us.	Eye mía dometɔ aɖewo hã le nenema.
The reality is much more complicated.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si le eme la sesẽ wu kura.
This is also contrary to his character.	Esia hã to vovo na eƒe nɔnɔme.
I wonder how long it can last	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɣeyiɣi didi kae wòate ŋu anɔ anyi hã
So far, in order.	Vaseɖe fifia la, le ɖoɖo nu.
Nobody does that in my house.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa nu ma le nye aƒeme o.
I have to stay at home.	Ele be manɔ aƒeme.
His voice sounded different.	Eƒe gbe ɖi to vovo.
That’s what it is.	Emae nye nusi.
I did everything right	Mewɔ nusianu nyuie
I didn't know how to react to that	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ nu ɖe ​​nya ma ŋu o
Now there is a lot to do.	Fifia nu geɖe li woawɔ.
I want to do it, more than anything	Medi be mawɔe, wu nusianu
It was very pleasant to him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I think that will definitely happen though	Mesusu be ema adzɔ godoo gake
Some say that everything would have been better.	Ame aɖewo gblɔ be nusianu anyo wu ema hafi.
I was very happy today	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ egbea
Something happened to him over the years.	Nane dzɔ ɖe edzi le ƒe siwo va yi me.
I finally found the truth	Meva ke ɖe nyateƒea ŋu mlɔeba
It is an honor to know you so well	Enye bubu nam be menya wò nyuie
His big year was obviously getting the better of him.	Edze ƒã be eƒe ƒe gã la nɔ edzi ɖum.
And if he can, for how long.	Eye ne ate ŋui la, ke ɣeyiɣi didi kae.
You are expected there.	Wole mɔ kpɔm na wò le afima.
I really wanted to talk	Medi vevie be maƒo nu
That’s enough soon.	Ema sɔ gbɔ kpuie.
But just for tonight.	Gake na zã sia ko.
You made a good point.	Ègblɔ nya nyui aɖe.
I was so nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ale gbegbe.
They probably are.	Anɔ eme be wole nenema.
But it didn’t bother me.	Gake meɖe fu nam o.
I definitely found out	Meva nya godoo
Some people died.	Ame aɖewo ku.
But I wasn’t getting myself into it	Gake nye ya menɔ ɖokuinye ƒom ɖe eŋu o
That would have been wrong.	Ema anye nu gbegblẽ hafi.
We don’t know what to do.	Míenya nusi míawɔ o.
Or very few will.	Alo ame ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ koe awɔe.
I hope you can do that too	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wò hã àte ŋu awɔ ema
I saw you there.	Mekpɔ wò le afima.
There was only one problem.	Kuxi ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
They are as ready as they are.	Wole klalo abe alesi wole klalo ene.
This is impossible to happen.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I beg you to be clear	Meɖe kuku na wò be nàgblɔ nya siwo me kɔ
I do this once in a while.	Mewɔa esia zi ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi aɖewo me.
I remember the excitement of that moment to this day	Meɖo ŋku dzidzɔ si nɔ anyi le ɣeyiɣi ma me dzi vaseɖe egbea dzi
I was very worried tonight	Metsi dzi vevie le zã sia me
And doing good work on this.	Eye dɔ nyui wɔwɔ le esia ŋu.
It’s obvious why you’re here.	Edze ƒã be nukatae nèle afisia ɖo.
I will be the only one to take care of it.	Nye ɖeka koe makpɔ edzi.
And everyone told him so.	Eye ame sia ame gblɔ nɛ nenema.
But I don’t know your name	Gake nyemenya wò ŋkɔ o
It’s a clever idea.	Enye susu si me aɖaŋu le.
People live longer now.	Amewo nɔa agbe didi wu fifia.
I doubt anyone here would say this is impossible.	Meke ɖi be ame aɖe le afisia agblɔ be esia manya wɔ o.
Part of it is missing now	Eƒe akpa aɖe bu fifia
See the truth for yourself.	Wò ŋutɔ kpɔ nyateƒea.
But that could take years.	Gake ema ate ŋu axɔ ƒe geɖe.
It can come at any time.	Ate ŋu ava ɣesiaɣi.
It surprised me, too	Ewɔ nuku nam hã
Find the truth.	Di nyateƒea.
Consider this thread, too.	Bu ka sia hã ŋu kpɔ.
It’s not me, man.	Menye nyee o, ame.
I know that’s me after all	Menya be nyee nye ema le nyateƒe me
Some of them were not so effective.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo mewɔ dɔ nenema gbegbe o.
It’s a quest, but one he can complete.	Enye didi aɖe, gake esi wòate ŋu awu enu.
It worked well for him.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie nɛ.
I can’t remember it at all	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi kura o
And you can’t go home either.	Eye màte ŋu ayi aƒeme hã o.
And a few other things.	Eye nu ʋɛ bubu aɖewo hã.
I hope there is a job for you	Mele mɔ kpɔm be dɔ aɖe anɔ anyi na wò
I haven’t heard back yet.	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso megbe haɖe o.
I'm sure you're busy with something	Meka ɖe edzi be vovo mele ŋuwò o le nane ŋu
Not the kind of job.	Menye dɔ si ƒomevi woawɔ o.
I just had to let that go	Ðeko wòle be maɖe asi le nya ma ŋu
Get so angry about things.	Do dziku ɖe nuwo ŋu ale gbegbe.
Which says two things.	Nusi gblɔ nya eve.
I was angry with myself	Medo dziku ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu
Obviously it could be.	Edze ƒã be ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
A fresh fresh breath of air.	Ya yeye yeye aɖe si me ya le.
I wasn’t happy with it	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu o
That worried me.	Ema tsi dzi nam.
I was there with my gun	Menɔ afima kple nye tu
I just can’t figure out what will do	Ðeko nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi awɔe o
I told the truth and I couldn’t do anything else	Megblɔ nyateƒea eye nyemate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke o
Years have passed.	Ƒe geɖe va yi.
I seem to remember that now	Edze abe meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi fifia ene
It didn’t bother me at all	Meɖe fu nam kura o
It won't last long anyway.	Manɔ anyi eteƒe didi o le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
He had no chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke menɔ esi o.
I didn’t see anything either	Nye hã nyemekpɔ naneke o
The morning things happened.	Ŋdi me nuwo dzɔ.
So is mine, too.	Nye tɔ hã le nenema.
I know he can do it.	Menya be ate ŋui.
But the same thing could happen next week.	Gake nu ma ke ate ŋu adzɔ le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me.
Everything else seems fine.	Edze abe nu bubu ɖesiaɖe le nyuie ene.
I think this may have happened four times	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ esia dzɔ zi ene
Experience whatever this is.	Kpɔ nusianu si esia nye la teƒe.
I knew what he was doing.	Menya nusi wɔm wònɔ.
There could be two reasons for this.	Susu eve ate ŋu anɔ esia ta.
I could do with some new stuff	Mate ŋu awɔe kple nu yeye aɖewo
A great job, actually	Dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me
I am not sure of anything at this point	Nyemeka ɖe naneke dzi le ɣeyiɣi sia me o
I understand them now.	Mese wo gɔme azɔ.
A few people got off	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo ɖi le eme
I just need to know what to do	Ðeko wòle be manya nusi mawɔ
If this happens, this is not a problem.	Ne esia dzɔ la, esia menye kuxi o.
It probably won’t work.	Anɔ eme be mawɔ dɔ o.
I just can’t answer them	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖo wo ŋu o
I asked him for help	Mebia kpekpeɖeŋu tso esi
Some of them must have finished, gone home.	Anɔ eme be wo dometɔ aɖewo wu enu, trɔ yi aƒeme.
I don't understand.	Nyemese egɔme o.
Or the first time, really.	Alo zi gbãtɔ, le nyateƒe me.
There is water there.	Tsi le afima.
I couldn’t express rational thoughts or leave	Nyemete ŋu gblɔ susu siwo me susu le alo dzo o
I’ll get the money.	Nyee axɔ ga la.
I carried death with me.	Metsɔ ku ɖe asi.
People talk to each other.	Amewo ƒoa nu na wo nɔewo.
Why? 	Nu ka ta?
He really did his part.	Ewɔ eƒe akpa dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And he was ready to go further.	Eye wònɔ klalo be yeayi ŋgɔ wu ema.
But the point is clear.	Gake nya la me kɔ.
I was so interested in them	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wo ale gbegbe
I can go on my way and get some work done now.	Mate ŋu ayi nye mɔ dzi awɔ dɔ aɖewo fifia.
I don’t know where to go	Nyemenya afi si mayi o
Maybe he had a change of heart.	Ðewohĩ eƒe dzi trɔ.
They are enough for you.	Wo sɔ gbɔ na wò.
There is no reason for that.	Susu aɖeke meli si tae wòle nenema ɖo o.
Everyone and everything else did.	Ame sia ame kple nu bubu ɖesiaɖe wɔe.
When, he couldn’t tell.	Ɣekaɣie, mate ŋu anya o.
Start early tomorrow.	Dze egɔme kaba etsɔ.
Legally and illegally.	Le se nu kple le mɔ si mele se nu o nu.
It has happened many times.	Edzɔ zi geɖe.
Through more things.	To nu geɖe wu me.
And that time is now.	Eye ɣeyiɣi ma nye fifia.
I know that place like the back of my hand	Menya teƒe ma abe nye asi ƒe megbe ene
Location, location, location.	Teƒe si wòle, teƒe si wòle, teƒe si wòle.
So .	Eya ta .
I know exactly what you are going through	Menya nu si me tom nèle la nyuie
I tried to get out but I couldn’t	Medze agbagba be mado go gake nyemete ŋui o
We’ll do this every night.	Míawɔ esia zã sia zã.
He didn’t remove his hand.	Meɖe eƒe asi ɖa o.
I can’t feel this way about someone who doesn’t exist	Nyemate ŋu ase le ɖokuinye me alea le ame aɖe si meli o ŋu o
I can’t live like that.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe nenema o.
He can find it. 	Ate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu. 
I wondered why he hadn’t come to see me	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukatae meva kpɔm o hã
I just want everything to be normal	Ðeko medi be nusianu nanɔ abe alesi wòle ene
You have a voice for this.	Gbe le asiwò na esia.
I didn’t do the work myself	Nye ŋutɔ mewɔ dɔa o
I couldn’t see a shape	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nɔnɔme aɖeke o
I will actually do it.	Mawɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That would be a waste of time.	Ema anye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
It wasn’t like that in the past.	Menɔ alea va yi o.
I can’t live without her	Nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi eya manɔmee o
This seems like a good idea to me.	Esia dze nam be enye susu nyui aɖe.
I would have to do it on my own.	Ahiã be mawɔe le ɖokuinye si.
Come on, man.	Va, ame.
Everything is minimal.	Nusianu nye nu sue aɖe ko.
The king of the mountain.	To la ƒe fia.
I did so little in it.	Nu sue aɖe koe mewɔ le eme nenema gbegbe.
Today, of course, this guy would be pregnant.	Egbea, le nyateƒe me la, ŋutsu sia anye fu.
I think at least a year, maybe two	Mesusu be ƒe ɖeka ya teti, ɖewohĩ eve
We know what to do.	Míenya nusi míawɔ.

He will do the same.	Awɔ nenema ke.

It’s a bad thing.	Enye nu gbegblẽ.

Where it was working fine until a few days ago.	Afisi wònɔ dɔ wɔm nyuie le vaseɖe ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo va yi.
I glanced down to see what he was looking at	Meɖe ŋku ɖe anyi be makpɔ nusi kpɔm wònɔ
I doubt they are all doing this	Meke ɖi be wo katã wole nu sia wɔm
I never expected it	Nyemekpɔ mɔ nɛ kpɔ o
Each will accommodate four.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe axɔ ame ene.
I am taking care of this.	Mele esia dzi kpɔm.
I think it makes some sense	Mesusu be susu le eme vie
This is too much, too soon.	Esia sɔ gbɔ akpa, kaba akpa.
There is no smoke without a fire.	Dzudzɔ aɖeke meli dzo aɖe manɔmee o.
I can’t find any fault	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ vodada aɖeke o
But it can’t be that way.	Gake mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I can do it with your help, or not	Mate ŋu awɔe kple wò kpekpeɖeŋu, alo mawɔe o
Nothing was working.	Naneke menɔ dɔ wɔm o.
I already have a strategy	Aɖaŋu aɖe le asinye xoxo
This is problematic and bad strategy for the project.	Esia nye kuxi kple aɖaŋu gbegblẽ na dɔa.
I think it’s a very good book	Mesusu be enye agbalẽ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ
He has a very good eye.	Ŋku nyui aɖe ŋutɔ le esi.
I think that’s important	Mesusu be ema le vevie
This is a good idea, but it’s not true.	Esia nye susu nyui aɖe, gake menye nyateƒe o.
But it doesn’t seem to matter.	Gake edze abe mehiã o ene.
I wasn’t the one playing anything	Menye nyee nye amesi nɔ naneke ƒom o
If that happens, take your time.	Ne edzɔ alea la, di wò ɣeyiɣi.

I want to share this with you	Medi be magblɔ nya sia na mi
I couldn’t decide who to call.	Nyemete ŋu tso nya me le amesi maƒo ka na ŋu o.

Nothing much interested me.	Naneke metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam boo o.

The ‘how’ doesn’t matter now.	‘Alesi woawɔ’ la mele vevie fifia o.
He won’t do that.	Mawɔe nenema o.
He began to respect.	Edze bubu gɔme.
A gust of wind blew in my face	Ya sesẽ aɖe ƒo ɖe nye mo
That’s why we know each other.	Eya tae míenya mía nɔewo ɖo.

Not that you’re not going to do it.	Menye be mèle ewɔ ge o.

The exact opposite.	Nusi to vovo na ema tututu.
There was only one man in each house	Ŋutsu ɖeka koe nɔ aƒe ɖesiaɖe me
I doubt a car could make it	Meke ɖi be ʋu aɖe ate ŋu aɖo afima
No wonder he was so tired.	Mewɔ nuku o be ɖeɖi te eŋu alea gbegbe.
I was the first person to come to the meeting.	Nyee nye ame gbãtɔ si va kpekpea.
Good point, but not true	Nya nyui aɖe, gake menye nyateƒe o
I needed to know where he had been.	Ehiã be manya afisi wònɔ tsã.
This always surprises me	Esia wɔa nuku nam ɣesiaɣi
You have one hour.	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka le asiwò.
I don’t know his name yet	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ haɖe o
I am working on something.	Mele dɔ wɔm tso nane ŋu.
But the car wasn’t there.	Gake ʋua menɔ afima o.
But too much is wrong.	Gake nu geɖe wɔwɔ nye nu gbegblẽ.
If anything is like that.	Ne nane le nenema.
The gun is in my car	Tu la le nye ʋu me
But this one couldn’t stand it.	Gake esia ya mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
But we can’t just let this go.	Gake míate ŋu aɖe asi le esia ŋu ko o.
This is too simple.	Esia le bɔbɔe akpa.
His hand searched for his gun.	Eƒe asi nɔ eƒe tu la dim.
And that about	Eye be anɔ abe 100 ene.
I couldn’t think of anything	Nyemete ŋu bu naneke ŋu o
I will take care of the whole thing myself.	Nye ŋutɔ makpɔ nu bliboa dzi.
Otherwise, no law is needed.	Ne menye nenema o la, se aɖeke mehiã o.
I’ve heard one before.	Mese ɖeka kpɔ.
I have done so up until this point	Mewɔe nenema vaseɖe ɣeyiɣi sia me
Machine with insufficient space	Mɔ̃ si me teƒe si sɔ gbɔ mele o
I can’t be with anyone right now	Nyemate ŋu anɔ ame aɖeke gbɔ fifia o
That is not true either.	Ema hã menye nyateƒe o.
I can’t do anything about that.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso ema ŋu o.
It's like now.	Ele abe fifia ene.
And that’s not a good thing.	Eye esia menye nu nyui aɖeke o.
I can’t stand food at all	Nyemete ŋu doa dzi le nuɖuɖu ŋu kura o
He too got hot.	Eya hã xɔ dzo.
Always talking to me.	Ɣesiaɣi la, ele nu ƒom nam.
It just won’t do that.	Ðeko mawɔe nenema o.
Give the thing and the room.	Na nu kple xɔ la.
It’s not clear that he can actually fight.	Medze ƒã be ate ŋu awɔ avu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
People lied about it.	Amewo da alakpa le eŋu.
Many people get angry in a very passive way.	Ame geɖe doa dziku le mɔ si mewɔa dɔ kura o nu.
I got out of work and see what.	Me do le dɔ me kpɔ nukae.
I also recognize your name	Mekpɔ wò ŋkɔ hã dze sii
It is very much like that.	Ele nenema ŋutɔ.
I was satisfied.	Nye dzi dze eme.
It just doesn’t work that way.	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
, but he won’t do that.	, gake mawɔe nenema o.
I felt very strongly about him	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ŋutɔ ɖe eŋu
I have an issue from yesterday.	Nya aɖe le ŋunye tso etsɔ.
I understand that to be true	Mese nya ma gɔme be enye nyateƒe
I have never been able to finish a meal here	Nyemete ŋu wu nuɖuɖu aɖe nu le afisia kpɔ o
I already know who you are	Menya ame si nènye xoxo
Hit them hard, really hard.	Ƒo wo sesĩe, sesĩe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is a good thing for them.	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe na wo.
And it never will be.	Eye manɔ anyi gbeɖe o.
Everyone for themselves	Ame sia ame na eɖokui
I didn't have much time to react	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke menɔ asinye mawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu o
Money as its legal name.	Ga abe eƒe ŋkɔ si le se nu ene.
I didn’t find any.	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke o.
I just can’t do that	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔe nenema o
I want him to have that	Medi be ema nanɔ esi
I know you.	Menya wo.
I know more about it than you do	Menya nu geɖe tso eŋu wu wò
He is there as if he is not there.	Ele afima abe ɖe mele afima o ene.
Shoot if necessary.	Da tu ne ehiã.
Maybe I know what that is.	Ðewohĩ menya nusi ema nye.
Trust them.	Ka ɖe wo dzi.
My life.	Nye agbe.
I can still see the real thing for you	Mate ŋu akpɔ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ la na wò kokoko
The best ones are too hard.	Wo dometɔ siwo nyo wu la sesẽ akpa.
I know they are doing just fine without me	Menya be wole edzi dzem nyuie nye manɔmee
It probably is.	Anɔ eme be ele nenema.
Time and date.	Ɣeyiɣi kple ŋkeke.
About the places he used to be.	Ku ɖe teƒe siwo wònɔ tsã ŋu.
It will work with just about anything.	Awɔ dɔ kple nusianu kloe.
I think it will work well for me	Mesusu be awɔ dɔ nam nyuie
There is no place name.	Teƒe aɖe ƒe ŋkɔ aɖeke meli o.
But he will find a way.	Gake akpɔ mɔ aɖe.
I needed to be alone to do that	Ehiã be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi hafi mate ŋu awɔ ema
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I want to drop this at his feet	Medi be maɖe asi le esia ŋu le eƒe afɔ nu
There were only two men at home.	Ŋutsu eve koe nɔ aƒeme.
I prayed there would be only one person to fight	Medo gbe ɖa be ame ɖeka koe nanɔ anyi mawɔ avu kplii
Everything was working fine.	Nusianu nɔ dɔ wɔm nyuie.
There was every chance he would do nothing.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ ɖesiaɖe nɔ anyi be wòawɔ naneke o.
I saw everything	Mekpɔ nusianu
What can we say about this	Nukae míate ŋu agblɔ tso esia ŋu .
I can’t find one of my own	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nye ŋutɔ tɔ ɖeka o
I was able to say a lot	Mete ŋu gblɔ nya geɖe
I don’t know if it will work though.	Nyemenya nenye be awɔ dɔ o ke hã.
And he did more than that.	Eye ewɔ nu geɖe wu ema ko.
I will go to the police	Mayi kpovitɔwo gbɔ
And he had never been able to see any of them.	Eye mete ŋu kpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke kpɔ o.
That idea really worked.	Susu ma wɔ dɔ nyateƒe.
I believe in us.	Mexɔ mía dzi se.
I just want to do a good job	Ðeko medi be mawɔ dɔ nyui aɖe
I will do any kind of work.	Mawɔ dɔ ɖesiaɖe ƒomevi.
I would love to just stay that way	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be manɔ nenema ko
I didn’t have a home	Aƒe menɔ asinye o
I tried this and did pretty well	Mete esia kpɔ eye mewɔe nyuie ŋutɔ
I don’t want to be alone	Nyemedi be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi o
I did everything for him.	Mewɔ nusianu nɛ.
Or in me.	Alo le menye.
I didn’t see any of them	Nyemekpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o
But this is too much.	Gake esia sɔ gbɔ akpa.
I have never seen anything so beautiful	Nyemekpɔ naneke si nya kpɔ alea gbegbe kpɔ o
I must be really tired	Ele be ɖeɖi te ŋunye ŋutɔŋutɔ
Work on it.	Wɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
I can’t fight it, not at all	Nyemate ŋu awɔ avu kplii o, menye nenema kura o
A good man at heart.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖe le dzi me.
I had everything one could want in life	Nusianu si ame ate ŋu adi le agbe me la nɔ asinye
I can always help, you know	Mate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu ɣesiaɣi, ènya
He ran into many problems that he could not solve.	Du ɖe kuxi geɖe siwo gbɔ mate ŋu akpɔ o me.
He never touched me.	Meka asi ŋunye kpɔ o.
I shouldn’t be working	Mele be manɔ dɔ wɔm o
I need everyone to do their job	Mehiã be amesiame nawɔ eƒe dɔ
Not too bad in the long run.	Menye nu gbegblẽ akpa le ɣeyiɣi didi me o.
You kind of know who that belongs to.	Ènya amesi tɔ ema nye le mɔ aɖe nu.
That’s his character.	Emae nye eƒe nɔnɔme.
Please let me know.	Taflatse na manya nane.
Maybe it will work.	Ðewohĩ awɔ dɔ.
A good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe.
That was the first day that came to mind.	Emae nye ŋkeke gbãtɔ si va susu me nam.
I need you to do this for me	Mehiã be nàwɔ esia nam
This just started this week.	Ðeko esia dze egɔme le kwasiɖa sia me teti koe nye ema.
Thank you for any reason.	Akpe na wò ɖe susu ɖesiaɖe ta.
I guess it’s really not that surprising	Mesusu be le nyateƒe me la, mewɔ nuku nenema gbegbe o
I had to hurry home	Ele be mawɔ kaba ayi aƒeme
I have to get closer to you	Ele be mate ɖe ŋuwò
I don’t want to talk to anyone	Nyemedi be maƒo nu kple ame aɖeke o
It’s a great shot.	Enye tu gã aɖe.
Good job, too.	Dɔ nyui hã.
That statement is true.	Nya ma nye nyateƒe.
I never felt that way about any other man	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema le ŋutsu bubu aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o
Someone needs you.	Ame aɖe hiã wò.
He was glad someone understood.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ be ame aɖe se egɔme.
It happened too far away from us.	Edzɔ le mía gbɔ akpa.
I am sure of this	Meka ɖe esia dzi
He didn’t expect to find anyone in the room.	Mekpɔ mɔ be yeakpɔ ame aɖeke le xɔa me o.
And time is not short.	Eye ɣeyiɣi hã mele kpuie o.
I tried one and it really worked	Mete ɖeka kpɔ eye wòwɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ
There are at least two reasons why it matters.	Susu eve ya teti li siwo tae wòle vevie ɖo.
He couldn’t see.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nu o.
I have no problem with that either.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ŋunye le ema hã ŋu o.
Everything went on.	Nusianu yi edzi.
But that may surprise us.	Gake ema ate ŋu awɔ nuku na mí.
They are not needed now.	Wo mehiã fifia o.
I had no name, no home	Ŋkɔ aɖeke menɔ asinye o, aƒe aɖeke menɔ asinye o
I think that’s the first thing	Mesusu be emae nye nu gbãtɔ
The issue is a simple one.	Nya la nye nya bɔbɔe aɖe.
I found something interesting myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mekpɔ nane si doa dzidzɔ nam.
He did something.	Ewɔ nu.
That means, there is a mistake.	Ema fia be, vodada aɖe li.
Hard hearted.	Dzi sesẽ.
I was like being in two places at once.	Menɔ abe ɖe mele teƒe eve zi ɖeka ene.
However, we are getting on with the point.	Ke hã, míele nya la dzi yim.
I hope it didn't last too long	Mele mɔ kpɔm be menɔ anyi eteƒe didi akpa o
He will not do what they ask.	Mawɔ nusi biam wole la o.
I think they have a point	Mesusu be nya aɖe le wo si
I just couldn’t decide	Ðeko nyemete ŋu tso nya me o
He just had no skill in making them.	Ðeko aɖaŋu aɖeke menɔ esi le wo wɔwɔ me o.
I doubt the whole thing took an hour.	Meke ɖi be nu bliboa xɔ gaƒoƒo ɖeka.
I felt a little more relaxed	Mese le ɖokuinye me be meɖe dzi ɖi vie
What is your opinion on this?.	Nukae nye wò susu le nya sia ŋu?.
Meet you.	Do go wò.
There is certainly a lot of truth in it.	Nyateƒe geɖe le eme godoo.
Something could happen tomorrow.	Nane ate ŋu adzɔ etsɔ.
But pretty much the same thing.	Gake nu ma ke kloe.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Or maybe something real.	Alo ɖewohĩ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe.
I can find something to eat	Mate ŋu akpɔ nane aɖu
A good one, but that’s all	Nyui aɖe, gake ema koe
I told you that.	Megblɔ nya ma na mi.
I will travel alone	Nye ɖeka koe azɔ mɔ
I think people are normal	Mesusu be amewo ƒe nɔnɔme sɔ
This didn’t help.	Esia meɖe vi aɖeke o.
I looked around the room	Mekpɔ xɔa me
What is that.	Nukae nye ema.
I just really care about you	Ðeko metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò ŋutɔ
I need you, my people need you	Mehiã wò, nye amewo hiã wò
I didn’t know you were in the car	Nyemenya be èle ʋua me o
I can’t let it all go	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le wo katã ŋu o
Not much else.	Menye nu bubu geɖe o.
But no one knows anything.	Gake ame aɖeke menya naneke o.
But he was very pleased.	Gake edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I didn’t know what to do or where to go	Nyemenya nu si mawɔ alo afi si mayi o
I just want to be happy	Ðeko medi be makpɔ dzidzɔ
I think he lost his mind.	Mesusu be eƒe susu bu.
Time has passed, of course.	Ɣeyiɣi va yi ya.
You’re not feeling well anymore.	Wò lãme megale nyuie o.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But you are not tired.	Gake ɖeɖi mete ŋuwò o.
This year was no exception.	Ƒe sia hã nɔ nenema ke.
I can stay until morning	Mate ŋu anɔ anyi vaseɖe ŋdi
We had a car that was.	Ʋu aɖe nɔ mía si si nye.
I also saw the whole thing.	Mekpɔ nu bliboa hã.
I am a very interesting person with a lot of interests.	Nyee nye ame si doa dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ eye nu geɖe tsɔ ɖe le eme.
I want to say something so many times	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖe zi gbɔ zi geɖe ŋutɔ
That's me.	Nyee nye ema.
It must have hit his mind.	Anɔ eme be edze eƒe susu me.
But it’s really never that simple.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mele bɔbɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
This is impossible to happen.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Everything is the same for us.	Nusianu nye ɖeka na mí.
As if someone had died.	Abe ɖe ame aɖe ku ene.
Maybe I can lend my support	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu ado nye kpekpeɖeŋu na amewo
I knew it was a big one	Menya be gã aɖee wònye
This is similar to a year earlier.	Esia sɔ kple ƒe ɖeka si do ŋgɔ.
I want to be in the here and now	Medi be manɔ afisia kple fifia la me
This made me worried too.	Esia na nye hã metsi dzi.
You have to do something.	Ele be nàwɔ nane.
I couldn’t hear her voice	Nyemete ŋu se eƒe gbe o
Something like this will work.	Nane si le abe esia ene awɔ dɔ.
I have to solve this problem	Ele nam be makpɔ kuxi sia gbɔ
But that is both true and untrue.	Gake nya ma nye nyateƒe eye menye nyateƒe hã o.
I had absolutely no idea what was going on	Nyemenya nusi le edzi yim kura o
I can see what happened	Mete ŋu kpɔa nusi dzɔ
He didn’t ask for any stones.	Mebia kpe aɖeke o.
We’re fighting every fight at once.	Míele avu ɖesiaɖe wɔm zi ɖeka.
I didn’t hear or see anything	Nyemese naneke alo kpɔ naneke o
It was part of the afternoon.	Ŋdɔ ƒe akpa aɖee nye ema.
I don’t understand that at all	Nyemese nya ma gɔme kura o
Time is not on his side.	Ɣeyiɣi mele eƒe akpa dzi o.
In fact, I don’t think he could	Le nyateƒe me la, mesusu be mete ŋui o
I remember what happened	Meɖo ŋku nusi dzɔ dzi
None of us can do it.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋui o.
I'll find out soon enough	Mava nya kpuie
It was a waste of time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
I, too, in my other way.	Nye hã, le nye mɔ bubu nu.
None of it makes sense, really.	Susu aɖeke mele wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o, le nyateƒe me.
Anyone who wants me to search.	Ame sia ame si di be madi.
I might be here to save one of these people	Ðewohĩ manɔ afisia be maɖe ame siawo dometɔ ɖeka
This is just plain wrong.	Ðeko esia nye nu gbegblẽ si dze ƒã.
I tried to get here.	Medze agbagba be mava ɖo afisia.
I was nervous but productive	Metsi dzodzodzoe gake mewɔ dɔ nyuie
There is so much more to life than food.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le agbe me wu nuɖuɖu.
I finally found someone who did	Meva ke ɖe ame aɖe si wɔe ŋu mlɔeba
I lost too much blood	Ʋu geɖe bu nam akpa
That is the challenge we face.	Emae nye kuxi si dze ŋgɔ mí.
It never seems to matter much.	Edze abe mele vevie ŋutɔ gbeɖe o ene.
That, too, is an old building.	Ema hã nye xɔ xoxo aɖe.
I wonder what the king would make of that	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae fia la awɔ tso ema ŋu hã
I couldn’t get behind this horse	Nyemete ŋu nɔ megbe na sɔ sia o
I never wanted to promise anyone	Nyemedi be mado ŋugbe na ame aɖeke kpɔ o
I deserve to know what’s going on	Medze be manya nusi le edzi yim
It was a place he had a passion for.	Enye teƒe aɖe si eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t find it.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
It’s not possible.	Manya wɔ o.
I just wanted to share my own take on that	Ðeko medi be magblɔ nye ŋutɔ nye nya tso nya ma ŋu
An hour was too little.	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka nɔ sue ŋutɔ.
A house needs people in it	Aƒe hiã amewo le eme
I hoped there would be none	Mekpɔ mɔ be ɖeke manɔ anyi o
I can do anything about it	Mate ŋu awɔ nusianu ɖe ​​eŋu
But he won’t do it.	Gake mawɔe o.
This is a bad idea.	Esia nye susu gbegblẽ aɖe.
Something very important to me is missing right now.	Nane si le vevie nam ŋutɔ la le to yim fifia.
That’s all there is to it.	Ema koe nye nu.
For the past week at least.	Le kwasiɖa si va yi me ya teti.
His mind returned.	Eƒe susu trɔ gbɔ.
I didn’t feel out of place.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be nyemele eteƒe o.
That’s what’s wrong.	Emae nye nusi gblẽ.
They are all the same.	Wo katã wole ɖeka.
I thought that was amazing.	Mesusu be ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That is very important to me.	Ema le vevie nam ŋutɔ.
That can’t be cheap.	Ema mate ŋu anye nusi mexɔ asi o.
A man like you can help me a lot	Ŋutsu abe wò ene ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ
There are no clothes for you.	Awu aɖeke meli na wò o.
But he didn’t answer.	Gake meɖo eŋu o.
I met him briefly.	Medo go kpuie.
I can’t go on with it	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi o
He didn’t want to do more.	Medi be yeawɔ nu geɖe wu o.
The police were nervous.	Kpovitɔwo tsi dzodzodzoe.
A very serious mistake.	Vodada gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
It seemed so small.	Edze abe ɖe wòle sue ŋutɔ ene.
I know what you want to do	Menya nu si nèdi be yeawɔ
I was there briefly this morning	Menɔ afima kpuie ŋdi sia

I know where I will find myself after death	Menya afisi makpɔ ɖokuinye le le ku megbe
I know this is hard for you.	Menya be esia sesẽ na wò.
I had to save myself	Ele nam be maɖe ɖokuinye
And his price, too.	Eye eƒe asi hã.
I'm just trying to explain.	Ðeko mele agbagba dzem be maɖe eme na wò.
Please, more of this sort of thing.	Taflatse, nu sia ƒomevi geɖe wu.
He was finally going to get that alone.	Eya ɖeka koe nɔ nya ma xɔ ge mlɔeba.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Go back to your own people.	Trɔ yi wò ŋutɔ wò amewo gbɔ.
I was wrong about that	Mewɔ vodada le nya ma ŋu
I will need to keep this in mind	Ahiã be esia nanɔ susu me nam
A few of them gave me curious looks	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo tsɔ ŋku ɖe ŋunye be manya nu geɖe
Honestly, I would have preferred to be seeing someone else	Le nyateƒe me la, anyo nam wu be manɔ ame bubu kpɔm hafi
I know what he likes	Menya nusi dzɔa dzi nɛ
I can’t imagine life without them	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ agbe le susu me wo manɔmee o
Fuck him hard.	Fu nɛ sesĩe.

I have the house to myself	Aƒea le asinye na ɖokuinye
We can work on it.	Míate ŋu awɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
There’s not much there yet though.	Nu geɖe mele afima haɖe o ke hã.

Hopefully we can.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be míate ŋui.

They all seem to have disappeared.	Edze abe wo katã bu ene.
Shoot one of them.	Da tu wo dometɔ ɖeka.
You are not one of them.	Menye wo dometɔ ɖekae nènye o.
For a good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe tae.
He didn’t deny the issue.	Megbe nya la o.
I used to not want to hope	Nyemedi be manɔ mɔ kpɔm o tsã
And it’s not something to be done about it.	Eye menye nane si woawɔ tso eŋu o.
The truth is quite different.	Nyateƒea to vovo kura.
I didn’t feel anything at all	Nyemese naneke le ɖokuinye me kura o
Some of them are missing parts.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo ƒe akpa aɖewo bu.
I can’t go anywhere.	Nyemate ŋu ayi afi aɖeke o.
Please have a manya.	Taflatse na manya.
It was a good meal.	Enye nuɖuɖu nyui aɖe.
Who does it best matters.	Amekae awɔe nyuie wu la le vevie.

Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Ðewohĩ mehiã o.

I was too relaxed	Meɖe dzi ɖi akpa
His voice was steady.	Eƒe gbe nɔ te sesĩe.

I love the excitement I felt.	Dzidzɔ si nɔ menye la dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Some came earlier.	Ame aɖewo va do ŋgɔ.
There’s a lot, actually.	Nu geɖe li, le nyateƒe me.

The kind of mindset it is.	Susu si ƒomevi wònye.
We have a time limit.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe le mía si.

That would be the last thing he would do.	Emae nye nu mamlɛtɔ si wòawɔ.
We need to do this quickly.	Ele be míawɔ esia kaba.

Indeed.	Le nyateƒe me.

I gave him permission, of course.	Meɖe mɔ nɛ ya.
It was very pleasant to him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
It seemed a little strange.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku vie ene.
He gave everything he had.	Etsɔ nusianu si le esi la na.
Everything is over between you and me.	Nusianu wu enu le mía kpli wò dome.
I had no idea there was so much	Nyemenya kura be nu geɖe ŋutɔ li o
I have always been able to rely on him	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋu ɖe eŋu ɣesiaɣi
But that takes up space.	Gake ema xɔa teƒe.
Many people have said that	Ame geɖe gblɔ nya ma
It’s necessary.	Ehiã.
I was at this place last night	Menɔ teƒe sia le zã si va yi me
And well it could happen.	Eye nyuie ate ŋu adzɔ.
I saw them looking at each other	Mekpɔ wo nɔ wo nɔewo kpɔm

But in my own way.	Gake le nye ŋutɔ nye mɔ nu.
I didn’t quite understand it	Nyemese egɔme tututu o
I think it will work better.	Mesusu be awɔ dɔ nyuie wu.
I was suddenly surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nam zi ɖeka.
However, it didn’t work.	Ke hã, mewɔ dɔ o.
I think he likes you	Mesusu be wò nu dzɔa dzi nɛ
Some of them have never owned a home.	Aƒe menɔ wo dometɔ aɖewo si kpɔ o.
I was doing really well.	Menɔ edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I know it’s true	Menya be enye nyateƒe
I lived here a good part of my life	Menɔ afisia nye nye agbe ƒe akpa nyui aɖe
If not, please.	Ne menye nenema o la, taflatse.
This cannot be the case.	Esia mate ŋu anɔ alea o.
This is so and not exactly so.	Esia le alea eye menye nenema tututu o.
I wonder what it’s like	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke wòle hã
A great man.	Ŋutsu gã aɖe.
Like he couldn’t stand it.	Abe ɖe mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o ene.
I need you here for a few hours	Mehiã wò le afisia gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo
If only he could find something to eat.	Ne ɖe wòate ŋu akpɔ nane aɖu la.
Not to him or anyone.	Menye eya alo ame aɖeke gbɔ o.
There is absolutely nothing appealing about it.	Naneke meli si doa dzidzɔ na ame le eŋu kura o.
I don’t trust any of them	Nyemeka ɖe wo dometɔ aɖeke dzi o
You just need to do this a little bit at a time.	Ðeko wòle be nàwɔ esia vie le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
I need you to police them	Mehiã be nàwɔ kpovitɔwo ƒe nu na wo
I couldn’t stand anything	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe naneke nu o
But where is it?.	Gake afi kae wòle?.
I reached the main road	Meɖo mɔ gã la nu
It can’t be this good.	Mate ŋu anye nu nyui sia o.
Someone to take care of them.	Ame aɖe si akpɔ wo dzi.
I had been my own person	Menye nye ŋutɔ nye ame kpɔ
I wonder if he will make any comments for me.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe wòawɔ nya aɖewo nam hã.
We’re not ready yet	Míele klalo haɖe o
And it really doesn’t do anything.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, mewɔa naneke o.
He can never really talk to her though.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu kplii ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o ke hã.
One person can have many things at the same time	Nu geɖe ate ŋu anɔ ame ɖeka ŋu le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me
I have to talk to them	Ele be maƒo nu kpli wo
I'm going to take a shower	Mele tsi ƒu ge
I lived in one day, over and over again	Menɔ agbe le ŋkeke ɖeka dzi, zi gbɔ zi geɖe
I had to try that myself at home	Ele be nye ŋutɔ mate ema kpɔ le aƒeme
Now this was unexpected.	Fifia esia menɔ mɔ kpɔm na o.
I don’t know what happened to them	Nyemenya nu si dzɔ ɖe wo dzi o
I wasn’t happy.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
And not on his face either.	Eye menye le eƒe mo hã o.
That we all are.	Be mí katã míenye.
Someone he was working with.	Ame aɖe si wònɔ dɔ wɔm kplii.
And he’s not the only one.	Eye menye eya ɖeka koe o.
Time for some personal space.	Ɣeyiɣi si me ame ŋutɔ ƒe teƒe aɖewo anɔ.
I can still do it.	Mate ŋu awɔe haɖe.
I haven’t felt this way in a long time	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia nyemese le ɖokuinye me alea o
I was hoping it would be quick.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be awɔ kaba.
We know better now.	Míenya nu nyuie wu fifia.
I will do something else.	Mawɔ nu bubu aɖe hã.
I want to know what that looks like	Medi be manya alesi ema le
We can’t go on like this.	Míate ŋu ayi edzi alea o.
I thought it was a dog	Mesusu be avu aɖee
It is, of course, the opposite.	Enye nusi to vovo na ema ya.
I was seeing a new me	Menɔ nye yeye aɖe kpɔm
Face the truth.	Dze ŋgɔ nyateƒea.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I got home last night, exhausted	Meɖo aƒeme le zã si va yi me, ɖeɖi te ŋunye
On the same subject.	Le nya ma ke ŋu.
In fact, he didn’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
That doesn’t make sense.	Susu mele nya ma me o.
Everyone who entered that room knew what was going on.	Amesiame si ge ɖe xɔ ma me la nya nusi nɔ edzi yim.
I tried to do more.	Medze agbagba be mawɔ geɖe wu.
Be a part of it.	Nye akpa aɖe.
There has to be a face, a name, everything.	Ele be mo, ŋkɔ, nusianu nanɔ anyi.
But now think about the car.	Gake azɔ bu ʋua ƒe nya la ŋu kpɔ.
I was very satisfied myself	Nye ŋutɔ nye dzi dze eme ŋutɔ
But you don’t really have it.	Gake mele asiwò ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I don’t have a voice anymore	Gbe aɖeke megale asinye o
I can’t live with that	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe kple ema o
I was angry more than anything	Medo dziku wu nusianu
But some good news.	Gake nya nyui aɖewo ya.
I would really appreciate it if someone could help me figure this out.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye makpɔ esia gbɔ.
I had a problem before	Kuxi aɖe nɔ ŋunye do ŋgɔ
It was an incredibly long night.	Zã didi aɖe si mewɔ nuku o ye wònye.
And for the same reason.	Eye le susu ma ke ta.
I just never expected this	Ðeko nyemekpɔ mɔ na esia gbeɖe o
I withdrew from myself	Meɖe ɖokuinye ɖa le ɖokuinye ŋu
But it isn’t like that	Gake mele nenema o
He didn't know what to do about it.	Menya nusi wòawɔ tso nya sia ŋu o.
I tried many times.	Medze agbagba zi geɖe.
You are not the first person here.	Menye wòe nye ame gbãtɔ si va afisia o.
I think there are two elements to that.	Mesusu be nu eve le ema me.
They were easy to find.	Wo didi nɔ bɔbɔe.
I can’t speak.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu o.
I wonder what we will do now	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae míawɔ fifia hã
The same old voice.	Gbe xoxo ma ke.
Now he can’t.	Fifia mate ŋui o.
Nothing without substance, anyway.	Naneke si me nu aɖeke mele o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I don’t mean to skimp on that.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be maɖe afɔ le nya ma ŋu o.
Things seem to be fine.	Edze abe nuwo nyo ene.
That’s enough.	Ema sɔ gbɔ.
I planned this whole project	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe dɔ sia katã ŋu
Buy what you like.	Ƒle nu siwo dze ŋuwò.
This is necessary.	Esia hiã.
But I had one problem	Gake kuxi ɖeka aɖe nɔ ŋunye
I knew that man was guilty	Menya be ŋutsu ma ɖi fɔ
And, obviously, no one can do this for so long.	Eye, edze ƒã be ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ esia ɣeyiɣi didi nenema gbegbe o.
And nice to meet you.	Eye edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò.
I saw a lifeless place	Mekpɔ teƒe aɖe si agbe mele o
Here, common sense says it is.	Le afisia la, susu nyui gblɔ be ele nenema.
I think this part is very important	Mesusu be akpa sia le vevie ŋutɔ
Open to the possibility that there something.	Ʋu mɔnukpɔkpɔ si li be afima nane le.
And things happened.	Eye nuwo dzɔ.
I could never live like that	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe nenema gbeɖe o
I still like them still.	Wo gakpɔtɔ dzɔa dzi nam kokoko.
A lot of things are annoying	Nu geɖe doa dziku na ame
The house of every great man was destroyed.	Ame gã ɖe sia ɖe ƒe aƒe dome gblẽ.
Personally, I think this is a little negative	Nye ŋutɔ mesusu be esia nye nu gbegblẽ vi aɖe
I have a lot of work from time to time	Dɔ geɖe le asinye tso ɣeyiɣi yi ɣeyiɣi
I tried to speak, but I couldn't	Medze agbagba be maƒo nu, gake nyemete ŋui o
And so time passed, a lot of it.	Eye ale ɣeyiɣi va yi, eƒe akpa gã aɖe.
Please try it.	Taflatse te kpɔ.
I wondered why this was so	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukatae esia le alea hã
That’s like the whole point.	Ema le abe nya bliboa ene.
I thought he was going to pick himself up	Mesusu be ele eɖokui fɔ ge
And there were four of them.	Eye wo dometɔ ene nɔ anyi.
I want to finish this quickly	Medi be mawɔ kaba awu esia nu
I don’t want to be angry	Nyemedi be mado dziku o
I can’t do anything.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
I don’t think that’s a problem	Nyemesusu be esia nye kuxi o
This book contributes two things.	Agbalẽ sia dzɔ nu eve.
Always now.	Ɣesiaɣi fifia.
Everyone did it.	Amesiame wɔe.
I had to get out of that house	Ele be mado le aƒe ma me
I was hoping he was doing better than me	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be ele nu wɔm nyuie wu nye
I know his name.	Menya eƒe ŋkɔ.
They are doing very very well.	Wole edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
Once upstairs.	Zi ɖeka yi dzi.
I know he doesn’t have that kind of money	Menya be ga ma ƒomevi mele esi o
Get in the mood.	Dze dɔme.
It shouldn’t be surprising though.	Mele be wòawɔ nuku o ke hã.
That’s really all there is to it.	Ema koe nye nusi le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I have stood firm for a long time	Metsi tre sesĩe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia
We should not treat one another kindly.	Mele be míawɔ nu ɖe ​​mía nɔewo ŋu nyuie o.
This really impressed me	Esia wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
That’s a bad idea.	Ema nye susu gbegblẽ aɖe.
Make it as you wish.	Wɔe abe alesi nèdi ene.
I am behind him.	Mele megbe nɛ.
This is a dead thing.	Esia nye nu kuku.
I think we have a lot in common	Mesusu be nu geɖe le mía dome siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo
He didn’t like us.	Míaƒe nu medze eŋu o.
He could come to her house and sing.	Ate ŋu ava eƒe aƒeme ava dzi ha.
I got stuck in it.	Meva tsi eme.
He did the job.	Ewɔ dɔa.
I had never heard of it	Nyemese eŋu nya kpɔ o
If you can do it.	Ne àte ŋu awɔe.
But everyone thought so.	Gake ame sia ame susui nenema.
He would like to do what is going on.	Adi be yeawɔ nu si le edzi yim.
He didn’t have to do that at all.	Mehiã be wòawɔ nu ma kura o.
I don’t want to go in there without him	Nyemedi be mayi ɖe afima eya manɔmee o
I was sweating and nervous	Mete fifia eye metsi dzodzodzoe
Any input would still be helpful, thanks.	Nya ɖesiaɖe si nàgblɔ la akpe ɖe ŋuwò kokoko, akpe.
But I was able to hold my own	Gake mete ŋu lé ɖokuinye ɖe te
I couldn’t quite remember.	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi tututu o.
I couldn’t look at them either	Nye hã nyemete ŋu lé ŋku ɖe wo ŋu o
There are very few rules.	Se ʋɛ aɖewo koe li.
In fact, I had no idea he had one	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya kura be ɖe le esi o
But you can’t talk.	Gake màte ŋu aƒo nu o.
There is a good opportunity for you.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ nyui aɖe li na wò.
Last night was that night.	Zã si va yi nye zã ma.
Tell me what you want me to say.	Gblɔ nya si nèdi be magblɔ nam.
I finally panicked	Metsi dzodzodzoe mlɔeba
I don’t know what’s going to happen	Nyemenya nusi ava dzɔ o
That didn’t last long.	Ema menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
I am just like you, too.	Nye hã mele abe wò ene.
I was a little relieved	Nye dzi dze eme vie
And he didn’t either.	Eye eya hã mewɔe nenema o.
Yours is totally inconsistent.	Wò tɔ mewɔ ɖeka kura o.
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
I only need your hand	Wò asi ɖeka koe mehiã
I'm giving myself a way on that one.	Mele mɔ aɖe nam ɖokuinye le ɖeka ma dzi.
Something happened in the room.	Nane dzɔ le xɔa me.
There was very little in it.	Nu sue aɖe koe nɔ eme.
I enjoy everything in life	Nusianu le agbe me la dzɔa dzi nam
Maybe he’s not mentally stable.	Ðewohĩ eƒe susu meli ke o.
He had that ‘it’ side.	‘Eya’ ƒe akpa ma nɔ esi.
He doesn’t know what he wants.	Nusi dim wòle la menya o.
A man has nothing to say	Ŋutsu aɖe ƒe nya le naneke ŋu o
None of us had any idea.	Susu aɖeke menɔ mía dometɔ aɖeke si o.
He had the time.	Ɣeyiɣi nɔ esi.
I said this would be the last	Megblɔ be esia anye mamlɛtɔ
Make good money this way.	Wɔ ga nyui to mɔ sia dzi.
I can’t feel it	Nyemate ŋu ase le ɖokuinye me o
He seemed like a really good fit for us.	Edze abe amesi sɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ na mí ene.
This is not a difficult issue.	Esia menye nya sesẽ aɖeke o.
We can see this moment in a different light.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ɣeyiɣi sia le mɔ bubu nu.
This is not like a real job.	Esia mele abe dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ ene o.
A man would have answered	Ŋutsu aɖe aɖo eŋu hafi
They must have had a job or something.	Dɔ alo nane anya nɔ wo si.
It doesn’t seem to have.	Edze abe mewɔe nenema o ene.
Everyone’s, please.	Amesiame tɔ, taflatse.
I think it might have helped, you know	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ akpe ɖe ŋuwò hafi, ènya
I came here on my own	Meva afisia le nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye me
Maybe it would explain more.	Ðewohĩ aɖe nu geɖe me wu.
Just my name, nothing else.	Nye ŋkɔ koe, menye nu bubu aɖeke o.
It looks very good.	Edze nyuie ŋutɔ.
I want to focus on you	Medi be nye susu nanɔ ŋuwò
A good car is good in itself	Ʋu nyui aɖe nyo le eɖokui si
And it’s a good news.	Eye nya nyui aɖee wònye.
I wanted to say his name but I couldn’t	Medi be magblɔ eƒe ŋkɔ gake nyemete ŋui o
I should want that for you	Ele be madi nenema na wò
I had a job to do.	Dɔ aɖe nɔ asinye.
I wondered why he did that	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukatae wòwɔ nenema hã
I could feel that already	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me nenema xoxo
He can’t do that.	Mate ŋu awɔ ema o.
I don’t want to be alone at home	Nyemedi be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi le aƒeme o
He didn’t care at all, really	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme kura o, le nyateƒe me
They are poised and ready for the job.	Wole klalo eye wole klalo na dɔa.
I guess that says something about me	Mesusu be ema gblɔ nane tso ŋunye
I hurried to the house	Mewɔ kaba yi aƒea me
I know what it’s like	Menya ale si wòle
But things went wrong there.	Gake nuwo gblẽ le afima.
A lot of people have asked me to do that.	Ame geɖe bia tso asinye be mawɔe nenema.
At his feet.	Le eƒe afɔ nu.
He has to work with her.	Ele be wòawɔ dɔ kplii.
I reminded myself to say something with him	Meɖo ŋku edzi na ɖokuinye be magblɔ nya aɖe kplii
That’s just a small part.	Akpa sue aɖe koe nye ema.
I hoped I wasn’t too old to understand.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be metsi akpa be mate ŋu ase egɔme o.
It can take weeks.	Ate ŋu axɔ kwasiɖa geɖe.
No one seemed to believe me.	Edze abe ame aɖeke mexɔ dzinye se o ene.
I couldn’t understand a word	Nyemete ŋu se nya aɖeke gɔme o
There is no single voice.	Gbe ɖeka aɖeke meli o.
Two things became very clear to me.	Nu eve va me kɔ nam ŋutɔ.
Who had not been there for years.	Ame si menɔ afima ƒe geɖe o.
That’s what it is, of course.	Emae nye ema ya.
I don’t think that’s likely to happen.	Nyemesusu be anɔ eme be ema adzɔ o.
We have more than enough space.	Teƒe si sɔ gbɔ wu le mía si.
Neither am I	Menye nye hã menye nenema o
He didn’t do this.	Mewɔ esia o.
I asked what was in them	Mebia be nukae le wo me hã
I know, now, where that came from	Menya, azɔ, afisi ema tso
But it would also be the opposite.	Gake anye nusi tsi tre ɖe eŋu hã.
I was just always wrong	Ðeko mewɔa nu gbegblẽ ɣesiaɣi
I was angry with myself	Medo dziku ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu
I made a gun.	Mewɔ tu aɖe.
He wasn’t the only one there.	Menye eya ɖeka koe nɔ afima o.
They have no eyes.	Ŋku aɖeke mele wo si o.
A strong man.	Ame sesẽ aɖe.
And this thing is good!.	Eye nu sia nyo!.
Stay right here.	Nɔ afisia tututu.
Do whatever you want with it.	Wɔ nusianu si nèdi kplii.
I hoped I would at least get water	Mekpɔ mɔ be makpɔ tsi ya teti
Everyone could have seen them.	Amesiame ate ŋu akpɔ wo hafi.
That is a concern for many	Nya ma le fu ɖem na ame geɖe
We’ll work on that.	Míawɔ dɔ tso ema ŋu.
I knew he would look at me	Menya be akpɔ ŋku ɖe ŋunye
A strong man.	Ame sesẽ aɖe.
There is no single name for this period.	Ŋkɔ ɖeka aɖeke meli na ɣeyiɣi sia o.
He didn’t like any part of it.	Eƒe akpa aɖeke medze eŋu o.
I haven’t heard anything that sounded as good as that	Nyemese nya aɖeke si ɖi nyuie abe ema ene o
You can’t imagine life without money.	Màte ŋu akpɔ agbe si me ga mele o la le susu me o.
He was a good guy.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe.
I know how that feels	Menya alesi ema se le eɖokui me
I couldn’t die for it	Nyemete ŋu ku ɖe eŋu o
I don’t want to fuck with it.	Nyemedi be mawɔ fu kplii o.
You seem to be doing pretty well.	Edze abe èle edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔ ene.
This thing he himself has seen.	Nu sia eya ŋutɔ kpɔ.
I was trying to make a plan	Menɔ agbagba dzem be mawɔ ɖoɖo aɖe
I know a few of them	Menya wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo
But this time it’s different.	Gake fifia ya, esia to vovo.
I can’t do without it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke ema manɔmee o.
He too changed his mind.	Eya hã trɔ eƒe susu.
This is already a very simple device.	Esia nye mɔ̃ si le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ xoxo.
How that is.	Alesi ema le.
I can’t walk out on my life	Nyemate ŋu azɔ ado go le nye agbe dzi o
Yet he did this.	Ke hã ewɔ esia.
But everyone did everything.	Gake amesiame wɔ nusianu.
I was very, very sick.	Medze dɔ vevie ŋutɔ.
That's me.	Nyee nye ema.
One cannot control it.	Ame mate ŋu akpɔ edzi o.
I hope they have a dog	Mele mɔ kpɔm be avu aɖe le wo si
It could be anything.	Ate ŋu anye nusianu.
It’s got a lot on it.	Eƒe nu geɖe le edzi.
Let’s try that out.	Mina míate ema kpɔ.
Talk to you tomorrow.	Ƒo nu kpli wò etsɔ.
I tried to fight my way out	Medze agbagba be mawɔ avu be mado le eme
Not just once, but several times.	Menye zi ɖeka ko o, ke zi geɖe hã.
And he never did anything.	Eye mewɔ naneke kpɔ o.
Somewhere in between.	Le afi aɖe le wo dome.
That would be pretty absurd, in this day and age.	Ema anye nusi me susu mele o ŋutɔ, le ŋkeke kple ɣeyiɣi sia me.
That last point is important.	Nya mamlɛtɔ ma le vevie.
I hope he does find someone	Mele mɔ kpɔm be akpɔ ame aɖe nyateƒe
That was his role.	Emae nye eƒe akpa si wòwɔ.
Just one night.	Zã ɖeka ko.
It’s an opportunity for you.	Enye mɔnukpɔkpɔ na wò.

I have been waiting for a month.	Ɣleti ɖekae nye esia mele lalam.
There are at least four of them.	Wo dometɔ ene ya teti ye li.
A voice that will tell you what is what.	Gbe aɖe si agblɔ nusi nye nusi na wò.
But finding the right fit is more difficult.	Gake nusi sɔ la didi sesẽ wu.
I thought he would kill me too	Mesusu be eya hã awu nye
I honestly couldn’t control myself	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemete ŋu ɖu ɖokuinye dzi o
It’s part of our blood.	Enye míaƒe ʋu ƒe akpa aɖe.
I am definitely angry now	Medo dziku godoo fifia
That made no sense.	Susu aɖeke menɔ nya ma me o.
In fact, quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo kura na emae.
It’s a new thing.	Nu yeye aɖee wònye.
I couldn’t explain it to myself	Nyemete ŋu ɖe eme na ɖokuinye o
We don’t know exactly what.	Míenya nusi tututu o.
One should not be so orderly, so grand.	Mele be ame nanɔ ɖoɖo nu alea gbegbe o, gã nenema gbegbe o.
No one could believe what they were seeing.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu xɔ nusi kpɔm wole la dzi se o.

I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.

But a lot of people don’t.	Gake ame geɖe ŋutɔ mewɔe nenema o.
Couldn't have been more helpful.	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu wu ema o.
I really don’t know what to do with this piece	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi mawɔ kple akpa sia o
This wasn’t another night.	Esia menye zã bubu aɖee o.

One shot at a time.	Tu ɖeka ɖesiaɖe.

And so is he, too.	Eye eya hã le nenema.

Tell me everything.	Gblɔ nusianu nam.

That’s why I was here.	Ema tae menɔ afisia ɖo.

I will do anything for you	Mawɔ nusianu na wò
But the reality is a bit different.	Gake nyateƒea to vovo vie.

I couldn’t do anything about it though	Nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke tso eŋu o gake

Not very long, anyway.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.

He was so interested in it.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme ale gbegbe.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Everyone has been out.	Amesiame do go kpɔ.
And this device works.	Eye mɔ̃ sia wɔa dɔ.
I have never felt this way before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me alea kpɔ o
But he couldn’t stand this guy.	Gake mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe ŋutsu sia dzi o.
Your mind is still there.	Wò susu gakpɔtɔ li.
Many people have spoken.	Ame geɖe ƒo nu.
There was definite similarity.	Nusi ɖi wo nɔewo godoo nɔ anyi.
I just felt that with him	Ðeko mese le ɖokuinye me nenema le eya gbɔ
I know this myself.	Nye ŋutɔ menya esia.
I couldn’t see clearly.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nu nyuie o.
I am here as it is.	Mele afisia abe alesi wòle ene.
But things have changed now.	Gake nuwo trɔ fifia.
This is a completely new situation.	Esia nye nɔnɔme yeye kura.
We can make this work.	Míate ŋu ana esia nawɔ dɔ.
I don’t know what happened at that point	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma me o
I know so much about them	Menya nu geɖe ŋutɔ tso wo ŋu
Look what it did to me.	Kpɔ nu si wòwɔ nam ɖa.
And we can’t go on.	Eye míate ŋu ayi edzi o.
I took care of everything today	Mekpɔ nusianu gbɔ egbea
Every moment mattered.	Ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe nɔ vevie.
I would be out of here soon	Anye ne mado le afisia kpuie
I will more or less tell you what happened	Magblɔ nusi dzɔ la na wò wu alo wu nenema
Explain it to you, if you can.	Ðe eme na wò, ne àte ŋui.
No one is worthy.	Ame aɖeke medze o.
That will come in the coming days.	Ema ava le ŋkeke siwo gbɔna me.
I can’t do anything about it	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso eŋu o
But he was in the work for many years.	Gake ƒe geɖe nɔ dɔa wɔm.
We can do with more.	Míate ŋu awɔe kple nu geɖe wu.
There is no real word for this.	Nya ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke meli na esia o.
I can’t imagine anything that amazing	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ naneke si wɔ nuku nenema gbegbe le susu me o
We don’t know yet.	Míenya haɖe o.
I would do the same thing.	Nye hã mawɔ nu ma ke.
He hasn’t released any yet.	Meɖe ɖeke ɖe go haɖe o.
I am a good person.	Ame nyui aɖee menye.
I wish they were done in but good	Medi be woawɔ wo le gake nyui
I don’t think that’s possible.	Nyemesusu be ema anya wɔ o.
Some people did that.	Ame aɖewo wɔe nenema.
I didn’t have any time for myself	Nyemekpɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖeke na ɖokuinye o
But it will come anyway.	Gake ava to mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I’m all about it.	Nye katã.
He was not here yesterday or today.	Menɔ afisia etsɔ alo egbea o.
Things could not have gone any better.	Nuwo mate ŋu ayi edzi nyuie wu hafi o.
That explains everything.	Ema ɖe nusianu me.
I can’t go out either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu ado go o
Take a little break.	Gbɔ ɖe eme vie.
I decided to save myself.	Meɖoe be maɖe ɖokuinye.
This thing is very good.	Nu sia nyo ŋutɔ.
If you have any questions about this, please contact her.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò ku ɖe esia ŋu la, taflatse te ɖe eŋu.
I could never stay mad at him	Nyemate ŋu anɔ dziku dom ɖe eŋu gbeɖe o
I should have done my hair	Ðe wòle be mawɔ nye ɖa hafi
And that annoys me.	Eye esia doa dziku nam.
But so far it looks great.	Gake vaseɖe fifia la, edze nyuie ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t find time to answer in advance.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ ɣeyiɣi ɖo eŋu do ŋgɔ o.
A week, sooner if necessary	Kwasiɖa ɖeka, kaba ne ehiã
I wonder how he knew that	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke wòwɔ nya emae hã
But something could happen.	Gake nane ate ŋu ado mo ɖa.
You can answer as you like.	Àte ŋu aɖo nya ŋu alesi nèdi.
Maybe that’s why.	Ðewohĩ esia tae.
Like me, too.	Abe nye ene.
I have something that might interest you	Nane le asinye si ate ŋu adzɔ dzi na wò
Look at this stone.	Kpɔ kpe sia ɖa.
I couldn’t figure out what was wrong.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi gblẽ le eŋu la dze sii o.
I want everyone to join with one other person	Medi be amesiame nawɔ ɖeka kple ame bubu ɖeka
It is not necessarily going to be easy.	Menye nusi anɔ bɔbɔe ɖe ge kokoko o.
A week ago I decided to do it	Kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia si meɖoe be mawɔe
I know there is a process and a process about	Menya be ɖoɖo aɖe kple ɖoɖo aɖe li ku ɖe
But it is very important.	Gake ele vevie ŋutɔ.
But there were a few problems.	Gake kuxi ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ anyi.
Make a waste of time.	Wɔ ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
I’ve never seen that before	Nyemekpɔ nu ma kpɔ o
But we can’t help it.	Gake míate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu o.
Or he will find us.	Alo akpɔ mí.
I only found out what happened here this morning	Nusi dzɔ le afisia ŋdi sia koe meva nya
The whole city attacked him.	Du bliboa katã dze edzi.
I think they kind of liked it	Mesusu be edzɔ dzi na wo le mɔ aɖe nu
I need something similar to this and this.	Mehiã nane si sɔ kple esia kple esia.
Right on the lake.	Le ta la dzi tututu.
I told you na that he had an idea	Megblɔ na wò na be eƒe susu aɖe le esi
I really wanted to get out of there	Medi vevie be mado le afima
I had to tell him something	Ele nam be magblɔ nya aɖe nɛ
I understand it better now	Mese egɔme nyuie wu fifia
I want to share some things with you, too	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖewo na mi, hã
I was concerned about that	Metsi dzi ɖe nya ma ŋu
I was surprised one night	Mewɔ nuku nam le zã aɖe me
There may be blood in it.	Ʋu ate ŋu anɔ eme.
I want no part of this	Nyemedi esia ƒe akpa aɖeke o
He didn't know how long it had been.	Menya ɣeyiɣi didi si va yi o.
I'm sure we can find them one of these days	Meka ɖe edzi be míate ŋu ake ɖe wo ŋu le ŋkeke siawo dometɔ ɖeka dzi
But they have a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖe le wo ŋu.
I knew this would happen too	Menya be esia hã adzɔ
I just wanted to say something	Ðeko medi be magblɔ nya aɖe
But there were moments.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖewo nɔ anyi.
Just a word.	Nya aɖe ko.
The mind can create its own reality	Susu ate ŋu awɔ eya ŋutɔ ƒe nu ŋutɔŋutɔ
I’m still not sure what the reality is.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ dzi haɖe o.
I can speak to the truth about this.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu na nyateƒe si le esia ŋu.
I can ride better than anyone here	Mete ŋu doa sɔ nyuie wu ame sia ame le afisia
Many houses in another phase were still there.	Aƒe geɖe siwo le akpa bubu me gakpɔtɔ nɔ afima.
Not an ideal situation.	Menye nɔnɔme si sɔ nyuie o.
But in reality, it is not quite so.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mele nenema tututu o.
I couldn’t go all night this time	Nyemete ŋu yi zã bliboa katã zi sia o
I was very excited.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
But that quickly changed.	Gake ema trɔ kaba.
There are so many things.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li.
I can’t talk to anyone	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu na ame aɖeke o
Before you do anything else.	Hafi nàwɔ nu bubu aɖe.
Other than that, things are pretty good.	Ne menye nenema o la, nuwo nyo ŋutɔ.
It’s a great machine here.	Enye mɔ̃ gã aɖe le afisia.
Not much, this gun.	Menye nu boo aɖeke o, tu sia.
There was no issue.	Nya aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
He couldn’t get out.	Mete ŋu do go o.
Not my own life.	Menye nye ŋutɔ nye agbe o.
I don't see anything about it here.	Nyemekpɔ naneke tso eŋu le afisia o.
I really have to go now.	Ele nam ŋutɔŋutɔ be mayi fifia.
You know what’s good.	Ènya nu si nyo.
I did more than that	Mewɔ nu geɖe wu ema ko
He might not say anything.	Ðewohĩ magblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I can eat pretty much anything too	Nye hã mate ŋu aɖu nusianu kloe
He had all night to formulate a plan.	Zã bliboa nɔ esi be wòawɔ ɖoɖo aɖe.
I want to be close to his stuff	Medi be mate ɖe eƒe nuwo ŋu
This isn’t surprising.	Esia mewɔ nuku o.
Perhaps you can send one.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu aɖo ɖeka ɖa.
And there is no lie.	Eye alakpa aɖeke meli o.
It cannot be right.	Mate ŋu anɔ eteƒe o.
I want to know the truth	Medi be manya nyateƒea
There are perhaps two parts to it.	Ðewohĩ akpa eve ye le eme.
I just did it last year	Ðeko mewɔe le ƒe si va yi me
I wish it were like this.	Anyo ŋutɔ ne ɖe wòle alea hafi.
We’re fighting each other over that.	Míele avu wɔm kple mía nɔewo le ema ta.
I’m glad he’s here tonight	Edzɔ dzi nam be ele afisia le zã sia me
I didn’t want to upset him	Nyemedi be mado dziku nɛ o
I'd rather see anything else	Anyo nam wu be makpɔ nu bubu ɖesiaɖe
I can do it this time too	Nye hã mate ŋu awɔe zi sia
I started working to create one	Medze dɔ gɔme be mawɔ ɖeka
None of them matter anymore.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke megale vevie o.
I know where my money is	Menya afisi nye ga le
I made a big mistake	Mewɔ vodada gã aɖe
It’s kind of my way.	Enye nye mɔ ƒomevi aɖe.
Someone is already there.	Ame aɖe le afima xoxo.
I had a pretty good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ asinye.
Clearly, that had been an issue for him in the past.	Edze ƒã be nya ma nye nya aɖe nɛ va yi.
And that was my first mistake.	Eye emae nye nye vodada gbãtɔ.
He wasn’t quite sure what would happen.	Meka ɖe nusi adzɔ dzi tututu o.
I tried to relax easily	Medze agbagba be maɖe dzi ɖi bɔbɔe
Now that has changed.	Fifia ema trɔ.
I can’t imagine her face though	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ eƒe mo le susu me o gake
I can’t hear them properly	Nyemate ŋu ase wo nyuie o
Please help me if you can.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye ne àte ŋui.
I thought it was another voice	Mesusu be gbe bubu aɖee
I was very skeptical about it	Meke ɖi le eŋu ŋutɔ
This was a good strategy for him.	Esia nye aɖaŋu nyui aɖe nɛ.
But this time is different.	Gake ɣeyiɣi sia ya to vovo.
I got things for you.	Mexɔ nuwo na wò.
This is a difficult problem.	Esia nye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
It was a wonderful thing.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There is nothing for me.	Naneke meli nam o.
I can’t speak right now	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu fifia o
Many good things he has done	Nu nyui geɖe siwo wòwɔ kpɔ
This is one of them	Esia nye wo dometɔ ɖeka
I need to know the truth	Ele be manya nyateƒea
I can’t understand them	Nyemate ŋu ase wo gɔme o
I just want to do better than some people	Ðeko medi be mawɔ nu nyuie wu ame aɖewo
Maybe I can do something for you	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu awɔ nane na wò
I’ve only been there twice	Zi eve koe meva afima
I think it will be that way	Mesusu be anɔ nenema
I should have known that	Ðe wòle be manya nya ma hafi
You seem to be like that.	Edze abe èle nenema ene.
I couldn’t believe it	Nyemete ŋu xɔ edzi se o
This is literally life and death here.	Esia nye agbe kple ku ŋutɔŋutɔ le afisia.
I’m not working for him	Nyemele dɔ wɔm nɛ o
Which seems simple enough.	Nusi dze abe ele bɔbɔe ale gbegbe ene.
I always rejected them.	Megbe wo ɣesiaɣi.
I shouldn’t be like that.	Mele be manɔ nenema o.
I came last.	Meva mamlɛtɔ.
And because of that.	Eye le ema ta.
I don’t really trust anyone	Nyemeka ɖe ame aɖeke dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o
No one is committed to his own name.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ eɖokui na eya ŋutɔ ƒe ŋkɔ o.
I know how much you want something like that	Menya alesi gbegbe nèdi nane si le abe ema ene
Many of them died.	Wo dometɔ geɖe ku.
I have that issue too.	Nya ma le asinye hã.
But it didn’t bother me	Gake meɖe fu nam o
I just couldn’t make myself, and he couldn’t understand	Ðeko nyemete ŋu wɔ ɖokuinye o, eye eya hã mete ŋu se egɔme o
That was enough for me.	Ema sɔ gbɔ nam ŋutɔ.
Something real.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe.
I promise you will be treated well.	Mado ŋugbe be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋuwò nyuie.
I want to tell you everything	Medi be magblɔ nya sia nya na mi
But I can’t see clearly	Gake nyemete ŋu kpɔa nu nyuie o
I was almost convinced	Meka ɖe edzi kloe
I remember it being clear as day	Meɖo ŋku edzi be eme kɔ abe ŋkeke ene
Today, no one is doing that.	Egbea la, ame aɖeke mele nu ma wɔm o.
I have to have a fire.	Ele be dzo nanɔ asinye.
I will take care of this too	Makpɔ esia hã gbɔ
I have to go to that now	Ele be mayi ema gbɔ fifia
I hope you enjoy it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be dzi adzɔ wò ŋutɔ.
I just don’t want that life	Ðeko nyemedi be agbe ma nanɔ asinye o
I know, another weird thing	Menya, nu bubu aɖe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
I couldn’t get through it	Nyemete ŋu to eme o
There is nothing like it	Naneke meli si sɔ kplii o
As simple as that.	Le bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
I know it must be one of them	Menya be anya nye wo dometɔ ɖeka
Not for many years.	Menye ƒe geɖe o.
He is like a dead man.	Ele abe ame kuku ene.
I don’t have much time left.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke megale asinye o.
It would be a bad thing.	Anye nu gbegblẽ.
I didn’t have to talk to him	Mehiã be maƒo nu kplii o
He is just like me, too.	Eya hã le abe nye ene.
When this was over.	Esi esia wu enu.
Someone had to be there for him.	Ele be ame aɖe nanɔ afima nɛ.
Go to the big idea.	Yi susu gã la gbɔ.
Few people escaped.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe si.
Or something else really expensive.	Alo nu bubu aɖe si xɔ asi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Someone said it would be a problem.	Ame aɖe gblɔ be anye kuxi.
Take a look at it.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu ɖa.
It’s just a matter of time though.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye gake.
I really don’t know what he can do	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi wòate ŋu awɔ o
I heard he wasn’t there	Mese be menɔ anyi o
And yet it is real.	Eye ke hã enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Now they have him.	Fifia eya le wo si.
You should, too.	Ele be wò hã.
It may, or may not, happen.	Ate ŋu adzɔ, alo mawɔe nenema o.
I wonder why he has two	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae eve le esi hã
I would have done that.	Anye ne mewɔe nenema.
Some of them did not prove it.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo meɖo kpe edzi o.
I have to get out of this town	Ele nam be mado le du sia me
None of them are expensive.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mexɔ asi o.
And it’s not the word.	Eye menye nya la hã o.
I think that’s pretty good	Mesusu be ema nyo ŋutɔ
This also surprised me.	Esia hã wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I never knew anything about you until now	Nyemenya naneke tso ŋuwò kpɔ o vaseɖe fifia ko
It’s like a small town in that regard.	Ele abe du sue aɖe ene le go ma me.
I didn’t expect it to come so late	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be ava tsi megbe nenema gbegbe o
He couldn’t relax.	Mete ŋu ɖe dzi ɖi o.
I think that sums it up	Mesusu be emae ƒo nu tso eŋu kpuie
I always keep my word	Mewɔa nye nya dzi ɣesiaɣi
And it couldn’t be more true here.	Eye mate ŋu anye nyateƒe geɖe wu le afisia o.
Not exactly there.	Menye afima tututu o.
That really hit home.	Ema ƒo ɖe aƒeme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He doesn’t remember that clearly	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi nyuie o
I was dealing with him for a long time	Menɔ nu wɔm kplii ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe
I couldn’t do it.	Nyemete ŋui o.
That is impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I was fighting against time	Menɔ avu wɔm kple ɣeyiɣi
But that didn’t occur to me.	Gake nya ma meva susu me nam o.
In the end, it may have worked just as well.	Mlɔeba la, ɖewohĩ ewɔ dɔ nyuie nenema ke.
I only heard one voice.	Gbe ɖeka koe mese.
I finally settled down	Meva nɔ afima mlɔeba
We need to do a better job of this.	Ele be míawɔ esia ƒe dɔ si nyo wu.
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
I had to give up everything	Ele be maɖe asi le nusianu ŋu
No one knew who he was.	Ame aɖeke menya amesi wònye o.
Maybe it didn’t exist.	Ðewohĩ menɔ anyi o.
I was surprised at how upset he was by this	Alesi esia do dziku nɛ la wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
You can’t do anything.	Màte ŋu awɔ naneke o.
Or he removed them himself.	Alo eya ŋutɔ ɖe wo ɖa.
I have been working on this for a day.	Mele dɔ wɔm tso esia ŋu ŋkeke ɖekae nye esia.
At this point, a very difficult issue arose.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, nya sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ do mo ɖa.
There is time.	Ɣeyiɣi li.
I’m not really sure about that.	Nyemeka ɖe nya ma dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
This will be the same.	Esia hã anɔ nenema.
They really had no idea.	Le nyateƒe me la, susu aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
This was most helpful.	Esia kpe ɖe ame ŋu wu.
I want to save your life.	Medi be maɖe wò agbe.
I have to tell you something though	Ele nam be magblɔ nya aɖe na wò gake
I knew what would happen	Menya nusi adzɔ
It is something that is very important to him.	Enye nusi le vevie nɛ ŋutɔ.
I know you can’t do anything	Menya be màte ŋu awɔ naneke o
Your guy.	Wò ŋutsu la.
I wondered what was going through his head	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae nɔ eƒe ta me tom hã
This means we have to work harder.	Esia fia be ele be míawɔ dɔ geɖe wu.
Everything is working smoothly and normally.	Nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie eye wòle dɔ wɔm le mɔ si sɔ nu.
I tell you this is a good idea	Megblɔ na mi be esia nye susu nyui aɖe
I wondered what it was like without them	Mebia ɖokuinye be aleke wòle wo manɔmee hã
I don’t really know what to do with myself	Nyemenya nusi tututu mawɔ ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o
I don’t have it anymore, anymore.	Megale asinye o, azɔ.
But it is important.	Gake ele vevie.
He kicked through them.	Etsɔ afɔ ƒo to wo me.
Shoot if you can.	Da tu ne àte ŋui.
I asked to see what they were being fed	Mebia be makpɔ nu si wole nuɖuɖu nam wo
And it may ultimately be no more.	Eye ate ŋu anye nusi wu ema mlɔeba o.
You have to do what you want.	Ele be nàwɔ nu si nèdi.
I will say this again and again	Magblɔ nya sia zi gbɔ zi geɖe
And you can do it.	Eye àte ŋui.
That’s good for some people.	Ema nyo na ame aɖewo.
He didn’t seem worried.	Edze abe metsi dzi o ene.
I was kind of nervous myself	Nye ŋutɔ metsi dzodzodzoe le mɔ aɖe nu
Your voice was there when no one else was.	Wò gbe nɔ afima esime ame bubu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
And everything gets a lot of attention.	Eye amewo ƒe susu nɔa nusianu ŋu ŋutɔ.
I like the way they are with each other	Ale si wole kple wo nɔewo la dzɔa dzi nam
I understand it better now, just a little bit	Mese egɔme nyuie wu fifia, vie ko
A big city or a small town.	Du gã alo du sue aɖe.
In fact, he was never really sure of much.	Le nyateƒe me la, meka ɖe nu geɖe dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
It will most likely be there.	Anɔ eme godoo be anɔ afima.
There has to be something.	Ele be nane nanɔ anyi.
They have a reality.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe le wo si.
I have been there to do that.	Menɔ afima kpɔ be mewɔ ema.
This is in error.	Esia le vodada me.
I will take care of this myself.	Nye ŋutɔ makpɔ esia gbɔ.
I would like your attention	Madi be wò susu le eŋu
But he usually doesn’t.	Gake zi geɖe la, mewɔa esia o.
Hope to see you all there!	Mele mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ mi katã le afima!
I came after the fact	Meva le nyateƒea megbe

It doesn’t seem like much.	Medze abe nu geɖe ene o.
And there is no other way.	Eye mɔ bubu aɖeke meli o.
I liked him, but there was something very strange about him	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam, gake nane wɔ nuku ŋutɔ le eŋu
But there was no joy in it for him.	Gake dzidzɔ aɖeke menɔ eŋu nɛ o.
I still don’t understand it	Nyemese egɔme haɖe o
We will have no one to help us.	Ame aɖeke manɔ mía si akpe ɖe mía ŋu o.
If someone says something, you do it.	Ne ame aɖe gblɔ nya aɖe la, ke wòe wɔe.
There was no alcohol in it.	Aha aɖeke menɔ eme o.

What can we help you with today.	Nukae míate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò egbea.

He, however, can get there in the afternoon.	Gake eya ya ate ŋu aɖo afima le ŋdɔ me.

However, this is very bad.	Ke hã esia gblẽ nu ŋutɔ.

Weird.	To vovo.

I am so busy.	Vovo mele ŋunye ale gbegbe.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Yet he could not speak.	Ke hã mete ŋu ƒoa nu o.
Something is wrong.	Nane gblẽ.
I know what that looks like	Menya alesi ema le
I am enjoying myself here.	Mele dzidzɔ kpɔm le afisia.
It was a wonderful thing.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I think not, more or less, accordingly	Mesusu be menye nenema o, wu alo wu nenema, le esia nu
But it’s not exactly that.	Gake menye nenema tututu o.
I finally moved into my own apartment	Meva ʋu yi nye ŋutɔ nye xɔ me mlɔeba
I definitely felt that way	Mese le ɖokuinye me nenema godoo
Or tell me something.	Alo gblɔ nya aɖe nam.
Work one down.	Dɔ ɖeka ɖe anyi.
I came with them.	Meva kpli wo.
We are together tonight.	Míele ɖekae le zã sia me.
Probably the opposite.	Ðewohĩ nusi to vovo na emae.
I came to expect them on my own	Meva nɔ mɔ kpɔm na wo tso ɖokuinye si
That happened here.	Ema dzɔ le afisia.
I can’t work long hours	Nyemete ŋu wɔa dɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe o
It’s been a long time coming.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia si gbɔna.
She still didn’t know he was watching her.	Menya kokoko be ele ye kpɔm o.
I don’t want to go home	Nyemedi be mayi aƒe o
This man's money put food in my mouth.	Ŋutsu sia ƒe ga na nuɖuɖu de nye nu me.
Anything really.	Nu ɖesiaɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He didn’t know these guys.	Menya ŋutsu siawo o.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe tae esia dzɔ ɖo.
We can do it.	Míate ŋu awɔe.
I want to live a simple life.	Medi be manɔ agbe bɔbɔe.
I have to make a face now	Ele be maɖe mo fifia
I am the last of my tribe	Nyee nye nye to la ƒe mamlɛtɔ
I know what that means.	Menya nusi ema fia.
I know that’s hard for you	Menya be ema sesẽ na wò
I can’t go there anymore	Nyemate ŋu ayi afima azɔ o
This was in many places.	Esia nɔ teƒe geɖe.
I can’t promise anything	Nyemate ŋu ado naneke ƒe ŋugbe o
It wasn’t that easy.	Menɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
I feel this is a great opportunity for you	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖee nye esia na mi
I just want to know more about you	Ðeko medi be manya nu geɖe tso ŋuwò
I really want to know about you	Medi vevie be manya nu tso ŋuwò
I never imagined where they would work	Nyemesusu afisi woawɔ dɔ le le susu me kpɔ o
That’s what makes it awesome.	Emae na wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But one problem remains the same.	Gake kuxi ɖeka gakpɔtɔ le nenema.
I needed something exciting	Mehiã nane si ado dzidzɔ nam
Someone can answer this question.	Ame aɖe ate ŋu aɖo nya sia ŋu.
I could be wrong about this	Mate ŋu anye vodada le nya sia ŋu
There is a long time ahead.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe le ŋgɔ gbɔna.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
If only we had known sooner .	Ne ɖe míenya kaba wu la .
But they are like that.	Gake wole nenema.
Nothing was going right.	Naneke menɔ edzi yim nyuie o.
I can see everything in your mind	Mete ŋu kpɔa nusianu le wò susu me
He needed the money.	Ehiã ga la.
In the end, he didn’t trust anyone.	Mlɔeba la, meka ɖe ame aɖeke dzi o.
Only one way presented itself.	Mɔ ɖeka koe ɖe eɖokui fia.
There is much work to be done.	Dɔ geɖe li woawɔ.
This book sounds so good.	Agbalẽ sia ɖi nyuie ale gbegbe.
This happened to me a few times.	Esia dzɔ ɖe dzinye zi ʋɛ aɖewo.
I shouldn’t have let it go	Mele be maɖe asi le eŋu hafi o
No problems arose during the process.	Kuxi aɖeke medo mo ɖa le dɔa wɔwɔ me o.
I can’t help myself	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o
I want to be here with you	Medi be manɔ afisia kpli wò
I don’t know what’s wrong with it	Nyemenya nusi gblẽ le eŋu o
I was definitely interested	Metsɔ ɖe le eme godoo
He didn’t understand it yet.	Mese egɔme haɖe o.
It can happen though.	Ate ŋu adzɔ gake.
This is quite clear.	Esia me kɔ nyuie.
I remember he was kind of smart	Meɖo ŋku edzi be enye ame ƒomevi aɖe si dze aɖaŋu
I am sure of this	Meka ɖe esia dzi
I put things in order	Meɖo nuwo ɖe ɖoɖo nu
I’m not feeling well.	Nyemele nyuie o.
I just can’t figure out how	Ðeko nyemate ŋu anya alesi mawɔe o
I fought everybody	Mewɔ avu kple amesiame
I relaxed back inside	Meɖe dzi ɖi trɔ yi eme
I'd rather just stay inside	Anyo be manɔ eme ko
What's in it today?.	Nukae le eme egbea?.
Something small, no big deal	Nane sue aɖe, menye nya gã aɖeke o
That’s not what we’re going to do.	Menye emae míawɔ o.
I told myself to relax	Megblɔ na ɖokuinye be maɖe dzi ɖi
Everything is fine.	Nusianu nyo.
Someone else, anyone else.	Ame bubu, ame bubu ɖesiaɖe.
I just want to be able to eat	Ðeko medi be mate ŋu aɖu nu
I don’t want to know who he is.	Nyemedi be manya amesi wònye o.
What he was doing.	Nusi wɔm wònɔ.
But it didn’t last long.	Gake menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
The room wasn’t ready.	Xɔa me menɔ klalo o.
I must know something	Ele be manya nane
I am sure you will enjoy them.	Meka ɖe edzi be wo adzɔ dzi na wò.
Reject the order.	Gbe ɖoɖo si nu wole la.
But I understood them	Gake mese wo gɔme
I hope you enjoy it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò.
This is still possible.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ kokoko.
He's just showing up.	Ðeko wòle eɖokui ɖem fia.
I really needed to get out there	Ehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ be mado le afima
You just hope everything turns out better.	Ðeko nèle mɔ kpɔm be nusianu ava yi nyuie wu.
I needed to talk to him	Ehiã be maƒo nu kplii
Whenever he was.	Ɣesiaɣi si wònɔ.
I don’t want any part of it	Nyemedi be eƒe akpa aɖeke nanɔ asinye o
You will be surprised how easy it is.	Awɔ nuku na wò be ele bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
I felt like my life depended on it	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye agbe nɔ te ɖe edzi
That process took about a month.	Dɔ ma wɔwɔ xɔ abe ɣleti ɖeka ene.
I made my way closer to the room	Mewɔ nye mɔ te ɖe xɔa ŋu wu
I haven’t been able to go back yet	Nyemete ŋu trɔ yi megbe haɖe o
The outcome of this one case is very encouraging.	Nusi do tso nya ɖeka sia me la de dzi ƒo ŋutɔ.
I would have to join him.	Ahiã be mawɔ ɖeka kplii.
I don’t want to or want to	Nyemedi be mawɔe alo di be mawɔe o
And he had quite a few of them.	Eye wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ nɔ esi.
Thank him for your work.	Akpe nɛ ɖe wò dɔa ta.
But that was really good for me	Gake ema nyo nam ŋutɔŋutɔ
It doesn’t matter.	Mehiã o.
I am looking forward to this	Mele esia lalam vevie
I had no idea who was watching us, or how	Nyemenya ame si nɔ mía kpɔm o, alo ale si wònɔ mía kpɔm o
If you have something to say, leave a comment.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò nàgblɔ la, ŋlɔ nya aɖe ɖe eme.
In this case,.	Le go sia me la,...
This is beautiful.	Esia nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
But this has changed completely.	Gake esia trɔ kura.
Night, after night, after night.	Zã, le zã megbe, le zã megbe.
This is too much.	Esia sɔ gbɔ akpa.
Seems like a good idea.	Edze abe susu nyui aɖee wònye ene.
But something had to be done about it.	Gake ele be woawɔ nane tso eŋu.
It happened to me, but not to that extent.	Edzɔ ɖe dzinye, gake menye vaseɖe afi ma o.
I’ve heard about you	Mese nu tso ŋuwò
I only met them once	Zi ɖeka koe medo go wo
People laughed so much.	Amewo ko nu ale gbegbe.
Everything else works.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe wɔa dɔ.
But keep going at it.	Gake yi edzi le edzi.
This one opened up a bit.	Esia ʋu vie.
It’s something you don’t want to do.	Enye nusi mèdi be yeawɔ o.
I just asked myself a simple question	Nya bɔbɔe aɖe koe mebia ɖokuinye
But we don’t have time.	Gake ɣeyiɣi mele mía si o.
He still had very little money and no job.	Ga sue aɖe koe gakpɔtɔ nɔ esi eye dɔ aɖeke menɔ esi o.
I really wanted us to work	Medi vevie be míawɔ dɔ
We don’t know who that is.	Míenya amesi nye ema o.
But I was expecting more than two	Gake menɔ mɔ kpɔm na ame siwo wu eve
I'm sure whatever you do will be great	Meka ɖe edzi be nu sia nu si nàwɔ la anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ
If only we could have gone	Ne ɖe míate ŋu ayi hafi
There is a problem with that.	Kuxi aɖe le ema ŋu.
There was no car.	Ʋu aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
His rational mind prevailed.	Eƒe susu si me susu le la ɖu dzi.
Everything is fine.	Nusianu nyo.
I almost fell backwards	Medze anyi ɖe megbe kloe
But none of them were there now.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ afima fifia o.
This is likely to happen quite a bit.	Anɔ eme be esia adzɔ vie ŋutɔ.
All in one year.	Wo katã le ƒe ɖeka me.
I can’t seem to do any better right now.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu awɔ nu nyuie wu fifia o ene.
I was definitely late getting home	Metsi megbe godoo le aƒeme ɖoɖo me
I wasn’t sure what to do	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ dzi o
I have worked before.	Mewɔ dɔ kpɔ.
I felt I had the money	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ga la le asinye
Be more focused.	Na wò susu nanɔ nu ŋu geɖe wu.
And it’s smart.	Eye edze aɖaŋu.
I'm just trying to figure things out.	Ðeko mele agbagba dzem be makpɔ nuwo gbɔ.

Please help me if you can.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye ne àte ŋui.
I am very happy to be here	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mele afisia
I know exactly what needs to be done	Menya nusi tututu wòle be woawɔ
There were four conditions.	Nɔnɔme ene nɔ anyi.
I was going to get this	Menɔ esia xɔ ge
Life is so good.	Agbe nyo ale gbegbe.
Who can speak.	Amekae ate ŋu aƒo nu.
I just want to be here	Ðeko medi be manɔ afisia
This was not necessarily the case.	Esia menɔ nenema kokoko o.
But he wasn’t worried.	Gake metsi dzi o.
Many problems can arise.	Kuxi geɖe ate ŋu ado mo ɖa.
I decided to look down	Meɖoe be makpɔ ŋku ɖe anyi
This is a fact.	Esia nye nyateƒe.
And another one, too.	Eye bubu hã.
Honestly, I couldn’t see anything in it	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemete ŋu kpɔ naneke le eme o
He needs to work on that sort of thing.	Ele be wòawɔ dɔ tso nu ma ƒomevi ŋu.
Everything is our problem.	Nusianu nye míaƒe kuxi.

I might have a reason	Susu aɖe ate ŋu anɔ asinye
I don’t want to upset you	Nyemedi be mado dziku na wò o
He couldn’t draw a conclusion.	Mete ŋu ƒo nya ta o.
Small or large.	Sue alo gã.
They don’t have the money.	Ga mele wo si o.
However, it is very simple.	Ke hã, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
That came pretty quickly.	Ema va kaba ŋutɔ.
I reached over my face.	Medo asi ɖe nye mo dzi.
It can’t be working yet.	Mate ŋu anɔ dɔ wɔm haɖe o.
In no way whatsoever.	Le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I’m not too sure about anything else	Nyemeka ɖe nu bubu aɖeke dzi akpa o
Two weeks is a long time.	Kwasiɖa eve nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
Nice to meet you	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò

I have heard a lot about you.    	Mese nu geɖe tso ŋuwò.    
But it could be a while.	Gake ate ŋu anye ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I should have told you all this	Ðe wòle be magblɔ nya siawo katã na mi hafi
I have been asking for more of it these days.	Menɔ eƒe akpa geɖe biam le ŋkeke siawo me.
I wasn’t sure at all	Nyemeka ɖe edzi kura o
So far it has worked great for me.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ewɔ dɔ nam ŋutɔ.
I want to tell you something	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖe na wò
I was finally finding myself.	Meva nɔ ɖokuinye kpɔm mlɔeba.
I tried to keep a positive attitude	Medze agbagba be susu nyui nanɔ eŋu
And, of course, that’s like me.	Eye, le nyateƒe me la, ema le abe nye ene.
That’s enough for this.	Ema sɔ gbɔ na esia.
One more hour, come on.	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka bubu, va.
You can have a conversation with him.	Àte ŋu aɖo dze kplii.
Hold your tongue.	Lé wò aɖe ɖe asi.
I should have acted sooner	Ðe wòle be mawɔ nu kaba hafi
But another wasn’t either.	Gake bubu hã menɔ nenema o.
I tried to.	Medze agbagba.
I listened to his voice	Meɖo to eƒe gbe
I was surprised at how upset he was by this.	Alesi esia do dziku nɛ la wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
My life was together	Nye agbe nɔ anyi ɖekae
He needs help.	Ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu.
I’m not in a hurry.	Nyemele du dzi o.
I started with my own	Medze egɔme le asinye
He rarely ever did	Ƒã hafi mewɔe kpɔ o
Maybe he had a little one by now.	Ðewohĩ vi aɖe nɔ esi vaseɖe fifia.
I'm not sure what his real name is	Nyemeka ɖe ŋkɔ si tututu nye eƒe ŋkɔ dzi o
I couldn’t think of it	Nyemete ŋu bu eŋu o
You have to be quick.	Ele be nàwɔ kaba.
He was pleased with the effect.	Dɔ si wòwɔ ɖe ame dzi la do dzidzɔ nɛ.
But he is too busy.	Gake vovo mele eŋu o akpa.
His face became more serious.	Eƒe mo va nɔ vevie wu.
But one problem at a time.	Gake kuxi ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
He is one of the most interesting characters.	Enye ame siwo ƒe nɔnɔme doa dzidzɔ na ame dometɔ ɖeka.
And we can go now.	Eye míate ŋu ayi fifia.
I probably could have walked there	Anɔ eme be mate ŋu azɔ ayi afima hafi
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Nothing strange about that.	Naneke mewɔ nuku le ema ŋu o.
All together in one room, all together.	Wo katã wole ɖeka le xɔ ɖeka me, wo katã wole ɖeka.
Everything seems to work fine with her.	Edze abe nusianu wɔa dɔ nyuie le eŋu ene.
From one place to another.	Tso teƒe ɖeka yi bubu.
A big surprise and a bit of a surprise	Nu gã aɖe si wɔ nuku eye wòwɔ nuku vie
Can see your underwear through them.	Te ŋu kpɔa wò awu te to wo dzi.
I was too surprised to think it through	Ewɔ nuku nam akpa be nyemete ŋu bu eŋu nyuie o
Yet no one is in sight.	Ke hã ame aɖeke mele ŋku dzi o.
I need to have your attention though, all your attention	Ele be wò susu nanɔ asinye gake, wò susu katã nanɔ asinye
A little bit of the night	Zã me vi aɖe
I was giving him something	Menɔ nane nam nɛ
I still don’t understand it	Nyemese egɔme haɖe o
His face appeared on the side of mine.	Eƒe mo dze le nye mo ƒe akpa aɖe.
I really wanted to talk to him.	Medi vevie be maƒo nu kplii.
I didn’t have much happiness in my life	Dzidzɔ boo aɖeke menɔ asinye le nye agbe me o
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But he could never comply.	Gake mete ŋu wɔ ɖe edzi gbeɖe o.
I can’t do anything with it	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke kplii o
. . . .	.
That wouldn’t have occurred to me.	Anye ne nya ma mava susu me nam o.
I did the opposite.	Mewɔ nusi to vovo na ema.
I just didn’t know anything about it	Ðeko nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o
I could remember it pretty well.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi nyuie ŋutɔ.
I can’t imagine life without you	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ agbe le susu me wò manɔmee o
But not for this reason.	Gake menye ɖe esia ta o.
Some people hate this.	Ame aɖewo lé fu esia.
I could hardly contain my desire for her	Nyemete ŋu lé nye didi ɖe eŋu la nu kura o
That’s a very good thing.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ.
I need food and water	Mehiã nuɖuɖu kple tsi
Or he didn’t do that.	Alo mewɔe nenema o.
I don’t know anyone like that.	Nyemenya ame aɖeke nenema o.
Really focus on wanting this to be the case.	Lé fɔ ɖe wò didi be esia nanɔ alea ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Nothing worked, nothing worked.	Naneke mewɔ dɔ o, naneke mewɔ dɔ o.
That will do that.	Ema awɔe nenema.
I got a lot more than that.	Mexɔ nu geɖe wu ema.
Some lost everything.	Ame aɖewo bu nusianu.
I remembered it this morning	Meɖo ŋku edzi ŋdi sia
I became interested in everything.	Meva tsɔ ɖe le nusianu me.
This is not important.	Esia mele vevie o.
That’s just you and me.	Mía kple wò koe nye ema.
There is a problem with attitude.	Kuxi aɖe le nɔnɔme ŋu.
I'll take care of it	Makpɔ edzi
That thing is necessary.	Nu ma hiã.
I just want to know what it is	Ðeko medi be manya nusi wònye
In fact, no one seems to know exactly where he was.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze abe ame aɖeke menya afisi tututu wònɔ o ene.
That is simply impossible.	Ðeko ema nye nusi mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
But some people were going on.	Gake ame aɖewo nɔ edzi yim.
That was another mistake he very nearly made.	Ema nye vodada bubu si wòwɔ kloe ŋutɔ.
You are in charge of the project.	Wòe le dɔa dzi kpɔm.
Otherwise, it doesn’t.	Ne menye nenema o la, mewɔe nenema o.
The police did nothing.	Kpovitɔwo mewɔ naneke o.
I just couldn’t shut my mind off	Ðeko nyemete ŋu tsi nye susu nu o
That’s why.	Esia tae.
He didn’t have a good job.	Dɔ nyui aɖeke menɔ esi o.
I want to find people who will.	Medi be madi ame siwo awɔe nenema.
I have to apologize	Ele be maɖe kuku
You are a part of it.	Ènye eƒe akpa aɖe.
I don’t know how to achieve that.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ aɖo ema gbɔ o.
If you can help me.	Ne àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye la.
We are working very hard.	Míele dɔ wɔm sesĩe ŋutɔ.
None of us are important.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mele vevie o.
I would have taken my time	Anye ne mexɔ nye ɣeyiɣi
But it can only be true to some extent.	Gake vaseɖe afi aɖe koe wòate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
And that seems highly unlikely.	Eye edze abe ema mate ŋu adzɔ kura o ene.
I don’t know why that thought occurred to me at that moment.	Nyemenya nusita susu ma va susu me nam le ɣeyiɣi ma me o.
I wonder why we are here	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae míele afisia hã
I remember it too well	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie akpa
Try really hard.	Dze agbagba vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Quite a few others too.	Ame bubu ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ hã.
He didn’t have time for it, anyway.	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ esi na esia o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
The water o.	Metsi o.
This went on for about a month.	Esia yi edzi anɔ abe ɣleti ɖeka ene.
I'll talk to him about that.	Maƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu nɛ.
That would be so close to me.	Ema ate ɖe ŋunye ale gbegbe.

This is old news for him.	Esia nye nya xoxo aɖe nɛ.
No one there wants to see you now.	Ame aɖeke mele afima madi be yeakpɔ wò fifia o.

He did a very good job.	Ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I wasn’t talking to you	Menye ɖe menɔ nu ƒom na wò o
I don’t know anything about it	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o
But it’s not good.	Gake menye nyuie o.

Can someone please help me.	Ðe ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye taflatse.
Not very big, not small.	Menye gã ŋutɔ o, menye nu sue o.

In the past, we.	Tsã la, mí.
This is a good thing for me now.	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe nam fifia.

It’s a really bad thing.	Enye nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We are two of a kind, he would always say.	Míenye ame eve siwo ƒomevi míenye, agblɔ ɣesiaɣi.
It’s a very different scenario than we have here.	Enye nɔnɔme si to vovo kura tso esi le mía si le afisia gbɔ.
I couldn’t stand what happened	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe nusi dzɔ la nu o
This is a different kind of dog.	Esia nye avu ƒomevi bubu aɖe.
Some of them are simple.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo le bɔbɔe.
It worked so well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ale gbegbe.

A lot of people are talking about it.	Ame geɖe le nu ƒom tso eŋu.

Few can or will do that.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe ate ŋui alo awɔe nenema.
Finally, a long time ago.	Mlɔeba la, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
This doesn’t have to be the case.	Mehiã be esia nanɔ nenema o.
It will work.	Awɔ dɔ.

It’s his character.	Enye eƒe nɔnɔme.

Time they may not have.	Ɣeyiɣi si ɖewohĩ manɔ wo si o.
I can’t stay here anymore	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afisia azɔ o
This one shot finally landed in the afternoon	Tu ɖeka sia va dze anyi mlɔeba le ŋdɔ me
Today wasn’t bad at least.	Egbea menye gbegblẽ ya teti o.
I said what any man would say in that situation	Megblɔ nya si ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe agblɔ le nɔnɔme ma me
That means two things in.	Ema fia be woawɔ nu eve le.
I can fight anything else.	Mate ŋu awɔ avu kple nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
But this is something completely different.	Gake esia nye nusi to vovo kura.
I managed to get through another night	Mete ŋu to zã bubu me kpɔ
I don’t have to explain myself often	Mehiã be maɖe ɖokuinye me zi geɖe o
I wasn’t sure what I was going to do after that.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ le ema megbe dzi o.
He never deserved it.	Medze nɛ kpɔ o.
He didn’t know these guys.	Menya ŋutsu siawo o.
I understand what this is	Mese nusi esia nye gɔme
I had to find another way	Ele be madi mɔ bubu aɖe
That’s just the fun part.	Akpa si doa dzidzɔ na ame koe nye ema.
We are not on the same side.	Míele akpa ɖeka dzi o.
You can kill someone.	Àte ŋu awu ame.
I don’t know about it	Nyemenya nu tso eŋu o
Now many years have passed.	Fifia ƒe geɖe va yi.
He was the only one there.	Eya koe nɔ afima.
This time he didn’t look away.	Fifia ya meɖe ŋku ɖa o.
But you can arrange it however you want.	Gake àte ŋu awɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu alesi nèdi.
I also wanted to let them go	Medi hã be maɖe asi le wo ŋu
No one else can give you that.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu ana ema wò o.
But there is something else, a kind of fire.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã li, dzo ƒomevi aɖe.
But this time remove your string a little faster.	Gake fifia ya ɖe wò ka la ɖa kaba vie.
His grip tightened on the gun.	Eƒe asi sesẽ ɖe tu la ŋu.
And for a long time.	Eye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe hã.
I made them alone.	Nye ɖeka koe wɔ wo.
In fact, he can’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, mate ŋui o.
I got something right in front of your face	Mexɔ nane le wò mo ŋgɔ tututu
I promise to explain everything	Medo ŋugbe be maɖe nusianu me
You have an idea in your head.	Susu aɖe le ta me na wò.
There are people here.	Amewo le afisia.
I can’t see your face	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wò mo o
I'm sure there will be a few.	Meka ɖe edzi be wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo anɔ anyi.
I wish I hadn’t come.	Ne ɖe meva o la, anye ne meva.
I have to be angry to win	Ele be mado dziku hafi aɖu dzi
I’ve tried it before.	Medze agbagba kpɔ.
This is the case.	Esia le alea.
Maybe we all are.	Ðewohĩ mí katã míele nenema.
I can’t help it now	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu fifia o
I think you will enjoy it	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò
I must be seeing something.	Ele be manɔ nane kpɔm.
He couldn’t understand it.	Mete ŋu se egɔme o.
I don’t know how to find it.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ ake ɖe eŋu o.
You can’t take away from that.	Màte ŋu aɖe nu le ema me o.
Himself about a year ago.	Eya ŋutɔ anɔ abe ƒe ɖeka enye sia ene.
I must be missing something obvious.	Anɔ eme be nane si dze ƒã la bu nam.
A good thing is a good thing	Nu nyui aɖe nye nu nyui aɖe
Nothing he did seemed to surprise her.	Edze abe naneke si wòwɔ si wɔ nuku nɛ o ene.
Two are not one.	Eve menye ɖeka o.
I have something.	Mewɔ nane.
He didn’t have any time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ esi o.
I had nowhere to stay	Teƒe aɖeke menɔ asinye manɔ o
If there is none, there is none.	Ne ɖeke meli o la, ke ɖeke meli o.
We don’t know anything about it.	Míenya naneke tso eŋu o.
I'm pretty sure someone was always close to us	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ be ame aɖe te ɖe mía ŋu ɣesiaɣi
His mind was racing.	Eƒe susu nɔ du dzi.
There is simply no way.	Ðeko mɔ aɖeke meli o.
It seems quite normal.	Edze abe nusi sɔ kura ene.
You just don’t know.	Ðeko mènya o.
This took up a lot of my time.	Esia xɔ nye ɣeyiɣi geɖe le asinye.
I already gave you my heart	Metsɔ nye dzi na wò xoxo
I didn’t hear anything back.	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso megbe o.
I shouldn’t explain that	Mele be maɖe nya ma me o
As if there was something in between.	Abe ɖe nane le wo dome ene.
They are waiting for me.	Wole lalam nam.
It’s a life.	Enye agbe.
But he was obviously smart too.	Gake edze ƒã be eya hã dze aɖaŋu.
He had never been so wrong.	Mewɔ vodada nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
This is a good plan.	Esia nye ɖoɖo nyui aɖe.
I need this for my own state of mind	Mehiã esia na nye ŋutɔ nye susu ƒe nɔnɔme
It’s something else.	Enye nu bubu aɖe.
I'd better continue on that	Anyo be mayi edzi le nya ma dzi
It was a very simple time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔ.
I will just say this	Magblɔ nya sia ko
I want to continue from there.	Medi be mayi edzi tso afima.
There is no rule against that.	Se aɖeke meli si tsi tre ɖe ema ŋu o.
Try again.	Te kpɔ ake.
I am somewhere else.	Mele teƒe bubu aɖe.
It seems like a good thing.	Edze abe nu nyui aɖee wònye ene.
Her voice surprised him.	Eƒe gbe wɔ nuku nɛ.
I have to say it was impressive	Ele nam be magblɔ be ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ
I don’t know why.	Nyemenya nusi tae o.
You are one of us now.	Mía dometɔ ɖekae nènye fifia.
I listened to you very carefully	Meɖo to wò nyuie ŋutɔ
I think there’s a lot to it as well	Mesusu be nu geɖe hã le eme
And we hope you can still have a nice conversation with us.	Eye míele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu aɖo dze nyui aɖe kpli mí kokoko.
I don’t know what happened	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ o
You have to fight them	Ele be nàwɔ avu kpli wo
I don’t know how any of us can survive.	Nyemenya alesi mía dometɔ aɖeke ate ŋu anɔ agbe o.
He didn’t say anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I have seen many of them	Mekpɔ wo dometɔ geɖe
Something is very wrong.	Nane gblẽ ŋutɔ.
I really enjoyed this book	Agbalẽ sia do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
Now, that will do it.	Azɔ, emae awɔe.
This law does not do that.	Se sia mewɔe nenema o.
Through your mouth.	To wò nu me.
It will help you.	Akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
That is very difficult	Ema sesẽ ŋutɔ
I wanted to tell myself it was just anger	Medi be magblɔ na ɖokuinye be dziku koe wònye
That meant a lot to me.	Ema fia nu geɖe nam.
He couldn’t see anything.	Mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
I had to deal with that	Ele be makpɔ nya ma gbɔ
I was just trying to protect his honor	Ðeko menɔ agbagba dzem be makpɔ eƒe bubu ta
That could be some time	Ema ate ŋu anye ɣeyiɣi aɖe
I remember that one.	Meɖo ŋku ɖeka ma dzi.
People told me I better move on.	Amewo gblɔ nam be anyo be mayi ŋgɔ.
I hope that continues.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ema ayi edzi.
I like this guy now	Ŋutsu sia dze ŋunye fifia
I saw something similar	Mekpɔ nane si sɔ kple esia
He was so smart, so focused.	Edze aɖaŋu ale gbegbe, eƒe susu nɔa nu ŋu ale gbegbe.
A very intelligent mind can do it	Susu si nya nu ŋutɔ ate ŋu awɔe
I was amazed at how he got away with this.	Alesi wòwɔ si le esia me la wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I planned this well in advance.	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe esia ŋu nyuie do ŋgɔ.
I will take care of them all	Makpɔ wo katã gbɔ
Hold onto the damage to your face.	Lé asi ɖe wò mo ƒe gbegblẽ ŋu.
And he had a way with his .	Eye mɔ aɖe nɔ esi kple eƒe .
I didn’t touch myself	Nyemeka asi ɖokuinye ŋu o
A normal week will be better for you.	Kwasiɖa si sɔ la anyo na wò wu.
This used to be home.	Esia nye aƒeme tsã.
So far, maybe.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ɖewohĩ.
This is obviously wrong.	Esia nye nu gbegblẽ si dze ƒã.
You can always find another job.	Àte ŋu akpɔ dɔ bubu ɣesiaɣi.
I just couldn’t stand that.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu do dzi le nya ma me o.
And this process will continue.	Eye ɖoɖo sia ayi edzi.
I just wanted to stay	Ðeko medi be manɔ anyi
The things that are going to happen to us.	Nu siwo ava dzɔ ɖe mía dzi.
Something no one can really say.	Nane si ame aɖeke mate ŋu agblɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
We’re going to do it together.	Míele ewɔ ge ɖekae.
I guess you could say that	Mesusu be àte ŋu agblɔ nya ma
But I’m surprised it’s not here for you.	Gake ewɔ nuku nam be mele afisia na wò o.
I think it will help me a lot.	Mesusu be akpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ.
I have found many people.	Meke ɖe ame geɖe ŋu.
Really, really good work.	Dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And things have to be there.	Eye ele be nuwo nanɔ afima.
He needs some help.	Ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo.
He has to do this.	Ele be wòawɔ esia.
It’s a very interesting thing.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
In fact, there is something in between.	Le nyateƒe me la, nane le wo dome.
This didn’t bother him.	Esia meɖe fu nɛ o.
And this guy.	Kple ŋutsu sia.
And you made a very valid point.	Eye ègblɔ nya aɖe si sɔ ŋutɔ.
I'm actually feeling better	Le nyateƒe me la, mele dzi dzem nam wu
I think you are, too	Mesusu be wò hã nèle nenema
I miss you so much.	Mesusu wò vevie.
But I know the truth.	Gake menya nyateƒea.
He had us.	Mí nɔ esi.
I couldn’t do my job	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nye dɔa o
It doesn’t do that for me.	Mewɔa esia nam o.
I just don’t want to talk about that	Ðeko nyemedi be maƒo nu tso nya ma ŋu o
I really don’t want to go	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be mayi o
I am not sure what you are asking	Nyemeka ɖe nu si biam nèle dzi o
Not that there was much to do.	Menye ɖe nu geɖe nɔ anyi woawɔ o.
But also a reasonable voice.	Gake gbe si me susu le hã.
Anyone and everyone can do this.	Ame sia ame kple amesiame ate ŋu awɔ esia.
All these words mean the same thing.	Nya siawo katã fia nu ɖeka ma ke.
I tried everything else though.	Mete nu bubu ɖesiaɖe kpɔ ke hã.
In a year’s time.	Le ƒe ɖeka me.
However, he never gave up.	Ke hã, meɖe mɔ gbeɖe o.
But I have no one else	Gake ame bubu aɖeke mele asinye o
This guy was there.	Ŋutsu sia nɔ afima.
They are too simple.	Wole bɔbɔe akpa.
I gave it a go.	Meɖe mɔ ɖe eŋu.
Not twice is certainly not possible.	Menye zi eve mate ŋu adzɔ nenema o godoo.
I know exactly what that looks like	Menya alesi tututu ema le
Two buildings were destroyed	Xɔ eve gblẽ
I had no idea what the project was about	Nyemenya nusi ŋu dɔa ku ɖo o
I don’t want to talk about it.	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso eŋu o.
This shouldn’t be the case.	Mele be esia nanɔ nenema o.
But this child survived.	Gake ɖevi sia tsi agbe.
I have to be that way.	Ele be manɔ nenema.
I personally would like to get to know you better	Nye ŋutɔ madi be manya wò nyuie wu
I think that’s something else	Mesusu be nu bubu aɖee nye ema
This rule is for everyone.	Se sia nye ame sia ame tɔ.
We can see this as follows.	Míate ŋu akpɔ esia ale.
I now want to backtrack on that.	Medi azɔ be maɖe megbe le nya ma ŋu.
I did it right.	Mewɔe nyuie.
I didn’t report anything missing	Nyemeka nya ta be naneke bu o
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
But listen to this.	Gake ɖo to nya sia.
That will improve in a little more time.	Ema anyo ɖe edzi le ɣeyiɣi si sɔ gbɔ vie wu me.
I wonder why we are here	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae míele afisia hã
That, too, annoyed him.	Ema hã do dziku nɛ.
There was only one chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
I got along well with him	Mewɔ ɖeka kplii nyuie
I wanted to spit in his face	Medi be maɖe ta ɖe eƒe mo
However, it is not working.	Ke hã, mele dɔ wɔm o.
As a result of this arrangement.	Le ɖoɖo sia ta la.
I was so glad for that	Edzɔ dzi nam ale gbegbe be ema ta
I need to find something else	Ele be madi nu bubu aɖe
I don’t want to talk about it	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso eŋu o
I just need some money.	Ðeko mehiã ga aɖe.
We can’t just sit here.	Míate ŋu anɔ anyi ɖe afisia ko o.
There is no mistake there.	Vodada aɖeke mele afima o.
I know my people.	Menya nye amewo.
You had everything you wanted.	Nusianu si nèdi la nɔ asiwò.
No law could help him.	Se aɖeke mete ŋu kpe ɖe eŋu o.
I am man enough to say that.	Nyee nye ŋutsu si sɔ gbɔ be magblɔ nya ma.
I was too angry to be annoyed	Medo dziku akpa be mado dziku nam
He seemed like a good kid.	Edze abe ɖevi nyui aɖee wònye ene.
I thought he would be angry	Mesusu be ado dziku
Four o'clock at night.	Gaƒoƒo ene le zã me.
Some came to mind.	Ame aɖewo va susu me nam.
One lie is enough.	Alakpa ɖeka sɔ gbɔ.
I know now that this will never work	Menya fifia be esia mawɔ dɔ gbeɖe o
That is impossible.	Ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I like your good sense.	Wò susu nyui si le asiwò la dze ŋunye.
I couldn’t say anything to him	Nyemete ŋu gblɔ nya aɖeke nɛ o
I miss you so much.	Mesusu wò ŋutɔ.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
I insisted that we join you	Mete tɔ ɖe edzi be míawɔ ɖeka kpli mi
I can’t help you	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò o
Lost in his own mind.	Bu le eya ŋutɔ ƒe susu me.
But we shouldn’t do this.	Gake mele be míawɔ esia o.
It’s so amazing.	Ewɔ nuku ale gbegbe.
I was hoping not really	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be menye le nyateƒe me o
I couldn’t say anything	Nyemete ŋu gblɔ nya aɖeke o
But he didn’t seem to care.	Gake edze abe metsɔ ɖeke le eme o ene.
I can’t function without it	Nyemate ŋu awɔ dɔ eya manɔmee o
I just don’t want to give up the sword	Ðeko nyemedi be maɖe asi le yi la ŋu o
This is clear for the first element of .	Esia me kɔ na nu gbãtɔ si le .
I was suddenly annoyed by the whole situation	Nɔnɔme bliboa do dziku nam zi ɖeka
That’s right.	Ema sɔ.
And this is a problem beyond himself.	Eye esia nye kuxi aɖe si gbɔ eya ŋutɔ ŋu.
It is working for them now.	Ele dɔ wɔm na wo fifia.
It is a name.	Ŋkɔ aɖee wònye.
His heart just wasn’t ready for that.	Ðeko eƒe dzi menɔ klalo na ema o.
But this time he wasn't so sure.	Gake fifia ya meka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o.
I was really worried about it.	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu nyateƒe.
I thought all was lost	Mesusu be nuwo katã bu
There is no time and no space.	Ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe meli o.
What he had hoped to find there.	Nusi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm be yeakpɔ le afima.
I wanted to know what was wrong with him	Medi be manya nu si le fu ɖem nɛ
We don’t know what happened to us.	Míenya nu si dzɔ ɖe mía dzi o.
He doesn’t tell us what this is.	Megblɔ nusi esia nye na mí o.
I haven’t been this happy in a long time	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ alea o
I understand that this can be a difficult time	Mese egɔme be ɣeyiɣi sia ate ŋu anye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe
I can’t save you	Nyemate ŋu axɔ na wò o
I was too sick to speak.	Medze dɔ akpa be nyemate ŋu aƒo nu o.
I am everything and everyone.	Nyee nye nusianu kple amesiame.
I felt sick, angry, and helpless	Mese le ɖokuinye me be medze dɔ, medo dziku, eye nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke o
And that’s really, that’s very important.	Eye ema le vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ, ema le vevie ŋutɔ.
He never said a word.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke kpɔ o.
I got one for myself too.	Mexɔ ɖeka na ɖokuinye hã.
I see you have his dog	Mekpɔ be eƒe avu le asiwò
Which is not much for me.	Nusi menye nu geɖe nam o.
I was able to live, I did something good	Mete ŋu nɔ agbe, mewɔ nu nyui aɖe
Everyone was so excited.	Dzi dzɔ amesiame ale gbegbe.
I never had to do that.	Mehiã be mawɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
That’s a very long one.	Ema didi ŋutɔ.
Someone who is very valuable	Ame aɖe si xɔ asi ŋutɔ
I don’t want a teacher	Nyemedi be nufiala aɖe nanɔ asinye o
I want to know more about it	Medi be manya nu geɖe tso eŋu
And my new building.	Eye nye xɔ yeye.
It just needs to be organized.	Ðeko wòle be woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
We know who he is.	Míenya amesi wònye.
I was very excited	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ
He won’t see them.	Makpɔ wo o.
But I’ve only been there a few times.	Gake zi ʋɛ aɖewo koe meva afima.
I just gave up on that life	Ðeko meɖe asi le agbe ma ŋu
He gave money.	Etsɔ ga na.
I struggled with this from day one	Mewɔ avu kple esia tso ŋkeke gbãtɔ dzi
I wish they were there	Ne ɖe wole afi ma la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
I fell backwards, losing my balance	Medze anyi ɖe megbe, eye nyemete ŋu da sɔ o
Run, hurry inside.	Du, kaba le eme.
I see you, child, and you are alone	Mekpɔ wò, ɖevi, eye wò ɖeka koe
I tried to make his heart.	Medze agbagba be mawɔ eƒe dzi.
At least in part.	Le eƒe akpa aɖe ya teti me.
Just a few feet away.	Afɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
Ours is so clear now.	Mía tɔ la me kɔ ale gbegbe fifia.
I know it looks great	Menya be edze nyuie ŋutɔ
I have to move on in life	Ele be mayi edzi le agbe me
You can do that, too.	Àte ŋu awɔ ema hã.
I had never heard of any of this	Nyemese nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke kpɔ o
Now I don’t have time to do this	Fifia ɣeyiɣi mele asinye mawɔ esia o
I came in a different direction	Meva to mɔ bubu dzi
But he never found them.	Gake meke ɖe wo ŋu kpɔ o.
I will tell him one thing	Magblɔ nya ɖeka nɛ
I told them all that nothing said anything	Megblɔ na wo katã be naneke megblɔ nya aɖeke o
It really is a life lost.	Enye agbe si bu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Which is a great thing.	Nusi nye nu gã aɖe.
It was obvious from his voice that something was wrong.	Edze ƒã le eƒe gbe me be nane gblẽ.
His people are good.	Eƒe amewo nyo.
We had a house.	Aƒe aɖe nɔ mía si.
I was just worried about what would happen to him	Ðeko metsi dzi ɖe nusi adzɔ ɖe edzi ŋu
Find out more about it.	Kpɔ nu geɖe tso eŋu.

He had never been there.	Menɔ afima kpɔ o.

Turn in an unfamiliar direction.	Trɔ ɖe mɔ si mènya o la dzi.
It’s not just death that can be there.	Menye ku koe ate ŋu anɔ afima o.
I was able to overcome that too	Mete ŋu ɖu ema hã dzi
I got a little shot	Meva tu ɖa vie
I knew something was wrong with me	Menya be nane gblẽ le ŋunye
I never quite understood why people did that	Nyemese nusita amewo wɔa nu ma gɔme tututu kpɔ o
I just hope he has time for me now	Ðeko mele mɔ kpɔm be ɣeyiɣi le esi nam fifia
I desperately needed help	Medi kpekpeɖeŋu vevie
I tried to see more	Medze agbagba be makpɔ nu geɖe wu
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
I would be really angry.	Mado dziku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t want to see the car	Nyemedi be makpɔ ʋua o
I think he’s passionate about it	Mesusu be dzo le eme ɖe eŋu
I need some help here.	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo le afisia.
I had to do this, I always did	Ele be mawɔ esia, mewɔe ɣesiaɣi
I want to go to work	Medi be mayi dɔme
Otherwise, there are two points, as follows.	Ne menye nenema o la, nya eve li, abe ale si gbɔna ene.
It’s a double-edged sword.	Enye zi gbɔ zi eve.
Something has definitely changed.	Nane trɔ godoo.
Somewhat true, if not obscure	Nyateƒe aɖe, ne menye esi me kɔ o
It just won’t work.	Ðeko mawɔ dɔ o.
He fled the scene.	Esi dzo.
I can’t really see them	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wo ŋutɔŋutɔ o
Now things will get better for him.	Fifia nuwo ava nyo nɛ.
I gave you my everything and nothing	Metsɔ nye nusianu kple nye naneke na wò o
I've got a kind.	Mekpɔ ƒomevi aɖe.
All of them, really.	Wo katã, le nyateƒe me.
I am fighting for my life.	Mele avu wɔm ɖe nye agbe ta.
He didn’t meet anyone.	Medo go ame aɖeke o.
A man who really couldn’t live up to his name	Ŋutsu aɖe si ŋutɔŋutɔ mete ŋu nɔ agbe ɖe eƒe ŋkɔ nu o
Two children were in the car, police said.	Kpovitɔwo gblɔ be ɖevi eve nɔ ʋua me.
I didn’t have much to do	Nu geɖe menɔ asinye mawɔ o
I probably would have done it this time	Anɔ eme be mewɔe zi sia hafi
I can only marry one of them at a time	Wo dometɔ ɖeka koe mate ŋu aɖe le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me
A dead man fell down.	Ame kuku aɖe ge dze anyi.
About four hours at least.	Anɔ abe gaƒoƒo ene ya teti ene.
These two are going to fight soon.	Ame eve siawo le avu wɔ ge kpuie.
I didn’t know about this before.	Nyemenya nu tso esia ŋu tsã o.
He seemed satisfied.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme ene.
I don’t expect them to act quickly.	Nyemele mɔ kpɔm be woawɔ nu kaba o.
I am in the heart of life.	Mele agbe ƒe dzi me.
I know that one too.	Menya ɖeka ma hã.
That is very difficult.	Ema sesẽ ŋutɔ.
Someone did something wrong	Ame aɖe wɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖe
I couldn’t think of what to pray	Nyemete ŋu bu nusi mado gbe ɖa ŋu o
I started doing this	Medze esia wɔwɔ gɔme
It will be, too.	Anye, hã.
This day is as important to you as it is to me.	Ŋkeke sia le vevie na wò ŋutɔ nenema ke le vevie nam hã.
Something must be missing, and it is.	Ele be nane bu, eye ele nenema.
I never knew a good person	Nyemenya ame nyui aɖeke kpɔ o
A big part of it.	Eƒe akpa gã aɖe.

I don’t think it will be his last.	Nyemesusu be anye eƒe mamlɛtɔ o.
At least not yet.	Menye haɖe ya teti o.
There was never a gun.	Tu aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
I think it’s a great, simple idea.	Mesusu be enye susu gã aɖe si le bɔbɔe.

I planted the first seed	Medo nuku gbãtɔ
This is also an honor.	Esia hã nye bubu.
I can’t come help you, and I can’t come help you	Nyemate ŋu ava kpe ɖe ŋuwò o, eye nye hã mate ŋu ava kpe ɖe ŋuwò o
Everything seems to be fine.	Edze abe nusianu le nyuie ene.
I doubt if he will give up easily	Meke ɖi nenye be ana ta bɔbɔe
You know how to get there.	Ènya alesi nàwɔ aɖo afima.
I don’t know how to do it.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔe o.
But I wanted to know about it	Gake medi be manya nu tso eŋu
I have been here before, just a few days ago	Meva afisia kpɔ, ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe nye esia
We are in the same school.	Míele suku ɖeka ma ke me.
I don’t really have anything to say	Nya aɖeke mele asinye magblɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o
But I think we can get somewhere	Gake mesusu be míate ŋu aɖo afi aɖe
I can handle the truth	Mete ŋu kpɔa nyateƒea gbɔ
I know it’s been a long time	Menya be ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia
I decided to do the same	Meɖoe be mawɔ nenema ke
Something sent him here.	Nane ɖoe ɖe afisia.
This worried me a lot.	Esia tsi dzi nam ŋutɔ.
You’re in order.	Èle ɖoɖo nu.
It was incredible.	Enye nusi mexɔ se o.
He wasn’t whispering in my ear.	Menye ɖe wònɔ nu ƒom le nye to me o.
Can anyone help with this please.	Ðe ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu le esia ŋu taflatse.
I can’t bear to hear anything to the contrary	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi ase nya aɖeke si tsi tre ɖe eŋu o
It would have been wrong.	Anye ne anye nu gbegblẽ wɔwɔ hafi.
I know what it was like	Menya alesi wònɔ
I was actually glad to be home	Le nyateƒe me la, edzɔ dzi nam be meva aƒeme
I don’t know what I’m going to be like.	Nyemenya alesi manɔ o.
I haven’t seen my home in a while	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia nyemekpɔ nye aƒe o
I want to have a long career	Medi be dɔ didi aɖe nanɔ asinye
An impressive real name	Ŋkɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe si wɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi
I just want your attention	Ðeko medi be wò susu nanɔ eŋu
This is.	Esia nye.
I think he will always have temper and attitude	Mesusu be dziku kple nɔnɔme anɔ esi ɣesiaɣi
But perhaps there’s a bit more to it than that.	Gake ɖewohĩ nu geɖe wu esia le eme vie.
Or for someone else.	Alo na ame bubu aɖe.
I do have a point though	Nya aɖe le asinye gake
I don’t know how to get food.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ akpɔ nuɖuɖu o.
No water of course but the same everywhere.	Tsi aɖeke meli o ya gake nenema ke wòle le afi sia afi.
I can see why you would.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nusita nàwɔ nenema ɖo.
I didn’t see that this year.	Nyemekpɔ ema le ƒe sia me o.
That truth he did not know, nor did anyone else.	Nyateƒe ma si eya ŋutɔ menya o, eye ame bubu aɖeke hã menya o.
I knew he was a little kid	Menya be ɖevi sue aɖee wònye
We have to work together.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ ɖekae.
Actually say them overnight to my mind.	Le nyateƒe me la, gblɔ wo le zã ɖeka me na nye susu.
And it can never be, it never was.	Eye mate ŋu anɔ anyi gbeɖe o, menɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
There is nothing like that.	Naneke meli nenema o.
He was pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ.
I believe in that rule.	Mexɔ se ma dzi se.
There was never a reason.	Susu aɖeke menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
I thought to myself, finally	Megblɔ le ɖokuinye me be, mlɔeba
Or in another way.	Alo le mɔ bubu nu.
I'll tell you what's going on.	Magblɔ nusi le edzi yim la na wò.
I can’t tell you this	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya sia na wò o
But in this case it worked in many ways.	Gake le go sia me la, ewɔ dɔ le mɔ geɖe nu.
I felt calm, relaxed	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme, meɖe dzi ɖi
That will help us.	Ema akpe ɖe mía ŋu.
I stayed there one morning.	Metsi afima ŋdi ɖeka.
I'll let you do that	Maɖe mɔ na wò nenema
Everything will be fine.	Nusianu anyo.
I can’t remember now	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi fifia o
Or take my word for it.	Alo xɔ nye nya la ɖe eteƒe.
I should have seen something	Ðe wòle be makpɔ nane hafi
Nothing so far.	Naneke meli vaseɖe fifia o.
I lightly touched her hand	Meka asi eƒe asi ŋu bɔbɔe
I haven’t been able to find it yet.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu haɖe o.
No one knows what will happen.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi ava dzɔ o.
This is working much better.	Esia le dɔ wɔm nyuie wu kura.
I could see it all, really	Mete ŋu kpɔ wo katã, le nyateƒe me
I am such a good person.	Nyee nye ame nyui ma gbegbe.
We are like water.	Míele abe tsi ene.
There is a difficulty here.	Sesẽ aɖe le afisia.
He needs this.	Ehiã esia.
I told myself that first thing in the morning	Megblɔ nu gbãtɔ ma na ɖokuinye le ŋdi me
I arrived right there.	Meva ɖo tututu.
This is very simple.	Esia le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
He wasn’t very happy with his job.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eƒe dɔa ŋu boo o.
Reasonable people entered.	Ame siwo si susu le la ge ɖe eme.
It could be quite the opposite.	Ate ŋu anye le mɔ si to vovo kura na ema nu.
A clear night.	Zã si me kɔ nyuie.
I couldn’t understand it.	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme o.
I am so glad he is doing this	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be ele esia wɔm
If not, something needs to be worked on.	Ne menye nenema o la, ke ahiã be woawɔ dɔ tso nane ŋu.
I have to explain tonight	Ele be maɖe nu me le zã sia me
And some others, too.	Eye ame bubu aɖewo hã.
He won’t do it.	Mawɔe o.
I could have stayed there for hours	Anye ne mate ŋu anɔ afima gaƒoƒo geɖe hafi
Others like me have asked for my help.	Ame bubu siwo le abe nye ene bia nye kpekpeɖeŋu.
I just need another day or two	Ðeko mehiã ŋkeke ɖeka alo eve bubu
And there are still four missing.	Eye ame ene gakpɔtɔ li siwo bu.
He just has to fight.	Ðeko wòle be wòawɔ avu.
Accordingly,.	Le esia nu la,...
I am not ready for this.	Nyemele klalo na esia o.
I think that’s appropriate	Mesusu be esia sɔ
I was a part of him and he was a part of me	Menye eƒe akpa aɖe eye eya hã nye nye akpa aɖe
I was so close to a gun	Mete ɖe tu aɖe ŋu ale gbegbe
I don’t know any better	Nyemenya nu nyuie wu o
I can’t live with that either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe kple ema o
It’s not that difficult.	Menye nu sesẽ nenema gbegbe o.
But he couldn’t control it.	Gake mete ŋu ɖu edzi o.
I had to do something	Ele be mawɔ nane
I could hear the surprise in his voice	Mete ŋu se nusi wɔ nuku le eƒe gbe me
I didn’t want to upset him	Nyemedi be mado dziku nɛ o
I am a new system now	Menye ɖoɖo yeye aɖe fifia
I can’t help you, and you can’t help me	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò o, eye wò hã màte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye o
I didn’t want to call him	Nyemedi be maƒo ka nɛ o
In this case, that doesn’t really matter.	Le go sia me la, ema mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I think you are one of them	Mesusu be wo dometɔ ɖekae nènye
Some things have changed in my life.	Nu aɖewo trɔ le nye agbe me.
It will be true.	Anye nyateƒe.
He was a very great man.	Enye ŋutsu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But no one knows what will happen.	Gake ame aɖeke menya nusi ava dzɔ o.
But this place is different.	Gake teƒe sia to vovo.
This is a waste of time.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
And the same job.	Eye dɔ ma ke.
I want to know what happened.	Medi be manya nusi dzɔ.
Maybe it was because he was home.	Ðewohĩ esi wònɔ aƒeme tae.
I did that last year	Mewɔe nenema le ƒe si va yi me
I had fun last night.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ le zã si va yi me.
It will be easier for us.	Anɔ bɔbɔe na mí wu.
Or maybe someone else will.	Alo ɖewohĩ ame bubu aɖe hã awɔe nenema.
I need to talk to you	Ehiã be maƒo nu kpli wò
I told him everything too	Megblɔ nya sia nya nɛ hã
I don’t know where else to go	Nyemenya afi bubu aɖeke si mayi o
I want to go tomorrow	Medi be mayi etsɔ
This is what I need in my life.	Esia nye nusi mehiã le nye agbe me.
But he didn’t think he could do it.	Gake mesusu be yeate ŋu awɔe o.
I would like to know what happened.	Madi be manya nusi dzɔ.
I couldn’t think of it.	Nyemete ŋu bu eŋu o.
I can’t inherit anything	Nyemate ŋu anyi naneke ƒe dome o
I have to get out.	Ele be mado go.
Everyone there was happy.	Dzi dzɔ amesiame si nɔ afima.
Now, this is not true.	Fifia, esia menye nyateƒe o.
It just didn’t work for me.	Ðeko mewɔ dɔ nam o.
He is on the road.	Ele mɔ dzi.
I was very, very pleased	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ
About something.	Le nane ŋu.
I tried to live with things	Medze agbagba be manɔ agbe ɖe nuwo nu
I should have known that was impossible.	Ðe wòle be manya be ema manya wɔ hafi o.
That’s good for that person.	Ema nyo na ame ma.
I deserve better.	Medze na nusi nyo wu.
I was trying to get you out of my head	Menɔ agbagba dzem be maɖe wò le nye ta me
No one is here long.	Ame aɖeke mele afisia ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
I didn’t tell him we would do that	Megblɔ nɛ be míawɔ nu ma o
I’m not really sure	Nyemeka ɖe edzi ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I fought the urge to say something	Mewɔ avu kple didi be magblɔ nya aɖe
They all seemed to be dead.	Edze abe wo katã ku ene.
I can’t keep working here like this	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ dɔ wɔm le afisia alea o
If you have any ideas, please let me know.	Ne susu aɖe le asiwò la, taflatse na manya.
I felt terrible and sick	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie eye medze dɔ
But it may not be the case.	Gake ɖewohĩ manɔ nenema o.
Some problems arose.	Kuxi aɖewo do mo ɖa.
That was their first chance.	Emae nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ gbãtɔ na wo.
He will need it.	Ahiã nɛ.
I could have stayed there for hours	Anye ne mate ŋu anɔ afima gaƒoƒo geɖe hafi
This is a different thing.	Esia nye nusi to vovo.
I am not in any of them.	Nyemele wo dometɔ aɖeke me o.
I can’t promise more	Nyemate ŋu ado ŋugbe geɖe wu o
I was anxious to see the outcome	Metsi dzi be makpɔ nusi ado tso eme
I will tell you the truth though.	Magblɔ nyateƒea na mi ke hã.
I think this is the opposite.	Mesusu be esia to vovo na ema.
I think it could be true	Mesusu be ate ŋu anye nyateƒe
And we all have that.	Eye ema le mía katã si.
I will arrange parts shipping	Mawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe akpa aɖewo ɖoɖo ɖe meli ŋu
I couldn’t write.	Nyemete ŋu ŋlɔ nu o.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
He will feel it.	Ase le eɖokui me.
Couldn't you	Ðe màte ŋui oa .
A few others.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo bubu.
That quickly changed.	Ema trɔ kaba.
I want to do this for him	Medi be mawɔ esia nɛ
That’s why he’s doing this.	Esia tae wòle esia wɔm ɖo.
Police are working on it.	Kpovitɔwo le dɔ wɔm tso eŋu.
I said, forget about that	Megblɔ be, ŋlɔ nya ma be
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That’s not necessarily a bad thing, of course.	Ema menye nu gbegblẽ aɖeke kokoko o ya.
I don’t know which is which	Nyemenya esi nye esi o
This would explain a few things.	Esia aɖe nu ʋɛ aɖewo me.
I should never have come here	Mele be mava afisia gbeɖe o
Now stop thinking about it.	Azɔ dzudzɔ eŋu bubu.
That would have been something real.	Ema anye nane ŋutɔŋutɔ hafi.
This guy is a man.	Ŋutsu sia nye ŋutsu.
I would have two cars, not one	Ʋu eve anɔ asinye, ke menye ɖeka o
I got out of this.	Medo le esia me.
I saw a horse where there was none	Mekpɔ sɔ aɖe le afisi sɔ aɖeke menɔ o

I want to do good with my life.	Medi be mawɔ nu nyui kple nye agbe.
My teacher was very strong on this.	Nye nufiala nɔ nya sia ŋu sesĩe ŋutɔ.
I think it’s an extreme honor for me	Mesusu be enye bubu si gbɔ eme nam
Everyone else does too.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã wɔa esia.
I don’t know much about it either	Nye hã nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o
I'll go talk to him now.	Mayi aƒo nu kplii fifia.
In that it can.	Le be ate ŋu.
I can’t say enough about it	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nu geɖe tso eŋu o
Sign up for one today!.	De asi agbalẽ te na ɖeka egbea!.
I can’t control my anger at that moment	Nyemate ŋu aɖu nye dziku dzi le ɣeyiɣi ma me o
He is a new person.	Enye ame yeye.
His voice was angry and angry.	Eƒe gbe do dziku kple dziku.
He is in this up to his neck.	Ele esia me vaseɖe eƒe kɔ dzi.
Twice your age.	Wò ƒe ƒe teƒe eve.
But things turned out well.	Gake nuwo va yi nyuie.
I don’t know anything.	Nyemenya naneke o.
Or just a separate ship.	Alo meli aɖe si le eɖokui si ko.
We know almost everything about each other.	Míenya nusianu kloe tso mía nɔewo ŋu.
I always wondered why he never asked me out	Mebiaa ɖokuinye ɣesiaɣi be nukatae mebia tso asinye gbeɖe be mado go o hã
I couldn’t resist this guy	Nyemete ŋu tsi tre ɖe ŋutsu sia ŋu o
Right now it doesn’t really matter.	Fifia la, mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I really have to see them	Ele nam ŋutɔŋutɔ be makpɔ wo
Right after that.	Le ema megbe teti.
I saw what people were really like	Mekpɔ alesi amewo le ŋutɔŋutɔ
The wish came true.	Didi la va eme.
Everything was working fine	Nusianu nɔ dɔ wɔm nyuie
I can't remember a time when he treated me kindly	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku ɣeyiɣi si me wòwɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋunye nyuie la dzi o
In what his life was going to be.	Le nusi eƒe agbe nɔ ge la me.
I was going to do it this afternoon	Menɔ ewɔ ge ŋdɔ sia
I think that’s a big mistake	Mesusu be vodada gã aɖee nye ema
You’ll be very excited.	Adzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ.
It makes no sense now as part of the final product.	Susu aɖeke mele eŋu fifia abe nu mamlɛtɔ si woawɔ ƒe akpa aɖe ene o.
I wonder how he got on it.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke wòwɔ ge ɖe edzi hã.
This is a waste of time.	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ.
I was hoping he wouldn’t be too mad at me	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be mado dziku ɖe ŋunye akpa o
I reminded him what they were like	Meɖo ŋku ale si wole la dzi nɛ
These rooms were occupied.	Amewo nɔ xɔ siawo me.

But I know about them.	Gake menya nu tso wo ŋu.
But there was no one there.	Gake ame aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
No one came along.	Ame aɖeke meva o.
But my own blood.	Gake nye ŋutɔ nye ʋu.
But there is a small problem.	Gake kuxi sue aɖe li.
Here’s the truth about that.	Nyateƒe si le ema ŋu la le afisia.
I want you tonight	Medi wò le zã sia me
He managed to escape, but he couldn’t	Mete ŋu si, gake mete ŋui o
However, he couldn’t speak at all.	Ke hã, mete ŋu ƒoa nu kura o.
The truth is the same.	Nyateƒea hã le ɖeka.
I can never replace him	Nyemate ŋu axɔ ɖe eteƒe gbeɖe o
That is his way.	Emae nye eƒe mɔ.
He can do anything	Ate ŋu awɔ nusianu
He couldn’t run now.	Mete ŋu ƒu du fifia o.

I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
But he never does this.	Gake mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
I said that to say this	Megblɔ nya ma be magblɔ nya sia
I was surprised he didn’t know about this	Ewɔ nuku nam be menya nu tso esia ŋu o
There is no time constraint.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe kuxi aɖeke meli o.

It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.

I don’t have to talk	Mehiã be maƒo nu o
I must have done something	Anɔ eme be mewɔ nane
I looked inside and there was no one there	Mekpɔ eme eye ame aɖeke menɔ afima o
I couldn’t figure out why this was true.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusita esia nye nyateƒe o.
That’s not my ambition.	Menye nye didi vevie nye emae nye ema o.
And we are doing it.	Eye míele edzi wɔm.

Make an effort to do it.	Dze agbagba ɖe eŋu.
But there are two sides here.	Gake akpa eve ye le afisia.

It’s not really an issue.	Menye nya aɖee wònye ŋutɔŋutɔ o.

Something about this book just really touched me.	Ðeko nane si ku ɖe agbalẽ sia ŋu la wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I want that life.	Medi agbe ma.
There are some holes in it.	Do aɖewo le eme.
There is a trick to everything in life.	Aɖaŋu aɖe le nusianu me le agbe me.
Maybe it’s all too much.	Ðewohĩ esia katã sɔ gbɔ akpa.

Very few people get to do that.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe kpɔa mɔ wɔa ema.

It’s not an easy thing to do.	Menye nu bɔbɔe aɖee wònye o.
It was about the same at breakfast this morning.	Ewɔ abe nenema ke ene le ŋdi nuɖuɖu me ŋdi sia.
Might be in this week.	Ðewohĩ anɔ eme le kwasiɖa sia me.
Come! 	Va!
I can handle this	Mate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ
Only people who would do that.	Ame siwo koe awɔ nu ma.
I needed to join him	Ehiã be mawɔ ɖeka kplii
I told him it was impossible	Megblɔ nɛ be manya wɔ o
Full name of each missing man.	Ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe si bu la ƒe ŋkɔ bliboa.
Click on it.	Zi edzi.
I think this guy is talking	Mesusu be ŋutsu sia le nu ƒom
I could have seen past it	Mate ŋu akpɔ nu to eŋu hafi
Everyone contributed and somehow everyone used them.	Amesiame dzɔ nu eye le mɔ aɖe nu la, amesiame zã wo.
There is something in it.	Nane le eme.
I would love that	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be ema
Anywhere else would be better.	Teƒe bubu ɖesiaɖe anyo wu.
I knew he was going to die at that point	Menya be ele kuku ge le ɣeyiɣi ma me
I wonder what else is going on.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nu bubu kae le edzi yim hã.
I also rejected this for several reasons	Megbe nya sia hã le susu geɖe ta
I set it up on a very simple plan.	Meɖoe ɖe ɖoɖo aɖe si le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ la dzi.
I want my own life	Medi be nye ŋutɔ nye agbe nanɔ asinye
I had to drop everything and go	Ele be maɖe asi le nusianu ŋu eye mayi
He didn’t see them.	Mekpɔ wo o.
There was nothing under that name either.	Naneke menɔ ŋkɔ ma te hã o.
I settled into the warm sand	Meva nɔ anyi ɖe ke si me dzo le la me
I think that would be really useful.	Mesusu be ema aɖe vi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That is why things are the way they are.	Esia tae nuwo le alea ɖo.
I was a little worried	Metsi dzi vie
I was in desperate need.	Mehiã vevie ŋutɔ.
I was able to believe it well.	Mete ŋu xɔ edzi se nyuie.
I am truly convinced.	Meka ɖe edzi nyateƒe.
After that, divide your hair into two parts.	Le ema megbe la, ma wò ɖa ɖe akpa eve me.
I cared about him as a person	Metsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ abe ame ene
Go easy, now.	Yi bɔbɔe, fifia.
I need to know who did this	Ele be manya amesi wɔ esia
My exact type.	Nye ƒomevi tututu.
Let me know if you have any good ideas.	Na manya ne susu nyui aɖewo le asiwò.
Things live there.	Nuwo nɔa agbe le afima.
I just needed his help finding them	Ðeko mehiã eƒe kpekpeɖeŋu le wo didi me
I need to see what exactly they are doing	Ele be makpɔ nusi tututu wɔm wole
It just wasn’t.	Ðeko menɔ nenema o.
That time and money is gone.	Ɣeyiɣi kple ga ma nu yi.
Obviously not here.	Edze ƒã be menye le afisia o.
I’m not in a state of mind.	Nyemele susu ƒe nɔnɔme aɖeke me o.
I gave my word on that	Metsɔ nye nya na le ema ŋu
But he didn’t like it.	Gake medze eŋu o.
I shouldn’t be watching this	Mele be manɔ esia kpɔm o
Help or something.	Kpekpeɖeŋu alo nane.
I knew he wouldn’t do it himself	Menya be eya ŋutɔ hã mawɔe o
I handled that.	Mekpɔ ema gbɔ.
I shouldn’t have saved him.	Menye nyee xɔ nɛ hafi o.
Or he is not a man.	Alo menye ŋutsu o.
There was the big mistake.	Vodada gã la nɔ afima.
This guy was right about the money.	Ŋutsu sia ƒe nya sɔ le ga la ŋu.
I really wanted to meet them.	Medi vevie be mado go wo.
But he didn’t care.	Gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
He too was still in his room.	Eya hã gakpɔtɔ nɔ eƒe xɔ me.
It really is a great thing.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Look at the room there.	Kpɔ xɔ si le afima ɖa.
He couldn't stand anything else now.	Mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe nu bubu aɖeke ŋu fifia o.
I understand your anger	Mese wò dziku gɔme
I didn’t know what to expect	Nyemenya nusi makpɔ mɔ na o
All these guys were there.	Ŋutsu siawo katã nɔ afima.
But one cannot just sit there.	Gake ame mate ŋu anɔ anyi ko o.
Law.	Se.
I was just trying to express myself	Ðeko menɔ agbagba dzem be maɖe nye susu agblɔ
A great search is being planned	Wole ɖoɖo wɔm ɖe didi gã aɖe ŋu
There just isn’t a lot of time.	Ðeko ɣeyiɣi geɖe mele afima o.
I didn’t get to see that one.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ akpɔ ɖeka ma o.
But it could be true.	Gake ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
I think that’s a rule	Mesusu be ema nye se aɖe
I hope he finds someone	Mele mɔ kpɔm be akpɔ ame aɖe
You don’t have anyone.	Ame aɖeke mele asiwò o.
That was me there.	Nyee nye ema le afima.
No one at all.	Ame aɖeke kura o.
I was dependent on it	Menɔ te ɖe edzi
Each works independently.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe wɔa dɔ le eɖokui si.
I couldn’t wait to meet them	Nyemete ŋu nɔ mɔ kpɔm be mado go wo o
After all, I kind of did a lot to get here	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔ nu geɖe le mɔ aɖe nu be mava afisia
He wasn't going to get that there.	Menye ɖe wònɔ ema ɖo ge le afima o.
I can’t stay in this place either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu anɔ teƒe sia o
There are involved markets.	Asi siwo le eme la li.
I wore another dress	Medo awu bubu
I need my own space	Mehiã nye ŋutɔ nye teƒe
I have something else for you	Nu bubu aɖe le asinye na wò
I can confirm this.	Mate ŋu aɖo kpe esia dzi.
I knew it would happen	Menya be ava eme
I’m sure you liked it	Meka ɖe edzi be eƒe nu lé dzi na wò
But a thousand years is so long.	Gake ƒe akpe ɖeka didi ale gbegbe.
But I can’t do that	Gake nyemate ŋu awɔ ema o
I also hope you can help in some way	Mele mɔ kpɔm hã be àte ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu le mɔ aɖe nu
Female.	Asi.
I should have told you all this	Ðe wòle be magblɔ nya siawo katã na mi hafi
He never wanted anything else.	Medi nu bubu aɖeke kpɔ o.
It's a very complicated matter of procedure.	Enye nya si me kɔ ŋutɔ le ɖoɖo nu.
Obviously, this is not possible.	Edze ƒã be esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
That would be something if you had the time.	Ema anye nane nenye be ɣeyiɣi le asiwò.
That’s a really big deal.	Nya gã aɖee nye ema ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And obviously strange too.	Eye edze ƒã be ewɔ nuku hã.
Something needs to be done.	Ehiã be woawɔ nane.
I really gave it all away	Metsɔ wo katã na nyateƒe
One does not make it out of this.	Ame aɖe mewɔa esia tso esia me o.
This will continue.	Esia ayi dzi.
But it’s not my business.	Gake menye nye nya o.
They’re doing really well.	Wole edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.

I couldn’t stomach him	Nyemete ŋu ƒo dɔme nɛ o
This is an incredible house.	Esia nye aƒe si mexɔ se o.
I can’t remember anything else	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nu bubu aɖeke dzi o
I can’t seem to figure out what this means.	Edze abe nyemate ŋu anya nusi esia fia o ene.
Think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ.
Act like this.	Wɔ nu alea.
You really can’t win.	Le nyateƒe me la, màte ŋu aɖu dzi o.
It looks pretty amazing.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ ene.
Otherwise, fine.	Ne menye nenema o la, nyuie.
Things went much better this time.	Nuwo yi edzi nyuie wu zi sia.
I have never been able to.	Nyemete ŋui kpɔ o.
I couldn’t really stand it.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
This is very important.	Esia le vevie ŋutɔ.
I am not myself.	Menye nye ŋutɔ nyee nye o.
I’ve always been like that	Nye hã menɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi
I believe in everyone here	Mexɔ amesiame dzi se le afisia
I couldn’t talk to him about it	Nyemete ŋu ƒo nu nɛ tso eŋu o
I don’t know how long he was there	Nyemenya ɣeyiɣi didi si wònɔ afima o
Until this year of course.	Vaseɖe ƒe sia me ya.
I certainly was, but he seemed to be in a bad mood.	Menɔ nenema godoo, gake edze abe eƒe lãme gblẽ ene.
We can talk about that.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu tso ema ŋu.
There is a lot of work in this way.	Dɔ geɖe li le mɔ sia nu.
I was something anyway	Menye nane le mɔ sia mɔ nu
He wasn’t the only one.	Menye eya ɖeka koe nɔ esi o.
I stood there waiting	Metsi tre ɖe afima nɔ lalam
He can do anything	Ate ŋu awɔ nusianu
I told you it would cost a great deal	Megblɔ na wò be axɔ nu gã aɖe
Think about your own life.	Bu wò ŋutɔ wò agbe ŋu kpɔ.
Whoever does it, ya talks dead.	Ame sia ame si awɔe la, ya ƒoa nu kuku.
Time to do some work.	Ɣeyiɣi si woawɔ dɔ aɖewo.
The first phase is over.	Akpa gbãtɔ wu enu.
I had to do it on my own	Ele be mawɔe le ɖokuinye si
I liked him and that made me happy.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam eye esia na mekpɔ dzidzɔ.
But it doesn’t seem to work.	Gake edze abe mewɔa dɔ o ene.
Not so long ago anyway.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia le mɔ sia mɔ nu o.
But there is one problem.	Gake kuxi ɖeka aɖe li.
I know exactly where he is	Menya afisi tututu wòle
An hour later, there was help.	Le gaƒoƒo ɖeka megbe la, kpekpeɖeŋu nɔ anyi.
That's me.	Nyee nye ema.
Your head will stick together.	Wò ta aƒo ɖe nu me.
He didn’t want what he had.	Nusi nɔ esi la medi o.
He can do this good	Ate ŋu awɔ nyui sia
There is nothing easy about it.	Naneke mele bɔbɔe le eŋu o.
I'd like to say you can but you can't.	Madi be magblɔ be àte ŋui gake màte ŋui o.
Something beyond death.	Nane si gbɔ ku ŋu.
I want to know everything that is going on in this city today.	Medi be manya nusianu si le edzi yim le du sia me egbea.
That took about a month.	Ema xɔ abe ɣleti ɖeka ene.
He had a hard life.	Agbe sesẽ aɖe nɔ esi.
I just had to come and see you	Ðeko wòle be mava kpɔ wò
It’s the same, maybe.	Nenema ke wòle, ɖewohĩ.

People from his past.	Ame siwo tso eƒe agbe me va yi.
That’s hard to find.	Ema didi sesẽ.
I grew up finding people who were me	Metsi le be ame siwo nye nye la dim
These types of people make money.	Ame siawo ƒomevi kpɔa ga.
These things themselves will work well.	Nu siawo ŋutɔ awɔ dɔ nyuie.
That’s what we’ll have.	Emae nye nusi anɔ mía si.
I would like to try in a different way	Madi be mate kpɔ le mɔ bubu nu
Things were going well.	Nuwo nɔ edzi yim nyuie.

I think that sums it up	Mesusu be nya ma ƒo nu tso eŋu kpuie
Not just one person.	Menye ame ɖeka ko o.
I would be totally like him	Nye hã manɔ abe eya ke ene kura
This is another great opportunity for him.	Esia hã nye mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã bubu nɛ.

There is a fire in it now.	Dzo le eme fifia.
I just wanted to explain myself a bit	Ðeko medi be maɖe ɖokuinye me vie

People got in on it.	Amewo ge ɖe edzi.
These guys are having a great time.	Ŋutsu siawo le dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔ.
I can still help him.	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu kokoko.
I couldn’t seem to help myself.	Edze abe nyemete ŋu kpe ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o ene.
Only reality is reality.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ koe nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I think this is an easy one	Mesusu be esia nye esi le bɔbɔe

I'll explain them all tomorrow	Maɖe wo katã me na wò etsɔ

There is no big deal.	Nya gã aɖeke meli o.
They are too fast.	Wole du dzi akpa.
You set that thing up.	Wòe ɖo nu ma anyi.

So far that has been that.	Vaseɖe fifia la, emae nye ema.

I knew he was at her house tonight	Menya be ele eƒe aƒeme le zã sia me
Please, please, please help us.	Taflatse, taflatse, taflatse kpe ɖe mía ŋu.
So, it is like that.	Eya ta, ele nenema.

It can help the foot.	Ate ŋu akpe ɖe afɔ ŋu.
I remember him from when he was with us	Meɖo ŋku edzi tso esime wònɔ mía gbɔ

I had no money for food anyway.	Ga aɖeke menɔ asinye ɖe nuɖuɖu ŋu le mɔ aɖeke nu o.

He couldn’t find any.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeke ŋu o.

I couldn’t understand it	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme o

Always.	Ɣesiaɣi.

And a little less hair.	Kple ɖa si le ʋɛ vie.
I had to get that out of my head.	Ele be maɖe nya ma ɖa le nye ta me.
It is inside.	Ele eme.
We don’t know which one.	Míenya esi o.
He didn’t believe in anything.	Mexɔ naneke dzi se o.
I had never seen his face.	Nyemekpɔ eƒe mo kpɔ o.
He couldn’t contain himself at all.	Mete ŋu lé eɖokui nu kura o.
Come to the meeting.	Va kpekpea.
He didn’t know what else to do.	Menya nu bubu si wòawɔ o.
If this sounds good to you, please contact me.	Ne esia ɖi nyuie na wò la, taflatse te ɖe ŋunye.
And there, there buy there.	Eye afima, afima ƒle le afima.

But there are two balances.	Gake nu eve aɖewo da sɔ le esia me.
He didn’t start eating.	Medze nuɖuɖu gɔme o.
Try things differently.	Te nuwo kpɔ le mɔ bubu nu.

And kind of weird.	Eye ƒomevi aɖe si mewɔ nuku o.
Almost everyone has heard this.	Ame sia ame kloe se nya sia kpɔ.
Let’s try some of that everything.	Mina míate ema dometɔ aɖewo kpɔ nusianu.

Thank you so much for that.	Akpe geɖe na wò ɖe ema ta.

Anything, please just anything.	Nusianu, taflatse nusianu ko.

He didn’t care about his job.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eƒe dɔa me o.
But a lot of time has passed	Gake ɣeyiɣi geɖe va yi
But it doesn’t seem to be.	Gake edze abe mele nenema o ene.
Today, however, this is far from true.	Gake egbea la, esia menye nyateƒe kura o.

It’s the best fit.	Enye nusi sɔ nyuie wu.

I think that’s a good thing.	Mesusu be esia nye nu nyui aɖe.
He probably didn’t know what was going to happen.	Anɔ eme be menya nusi ava dzɔ o.

But this is not necessary.	Gake esia mehiã o.
There are two that are very important.	Eve li siwo le vevie ŋutɔ.

He looked tired again.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ake ene.

I don’t know how to find you	Nyemenya ale si mawɔ ake ɖe ŋuwò o
This problem is really psychological.	Kuxi sia nye susu me nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Maybe he was just someone better than me.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe si nyo wu nye koe wònye.
It could be me.	Ate ŋu anye nye.

At this point, he didn’t care.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
And, for good reason.	Eye, susu nyui aɖe tae.

This made her more attractive than ever.	Esia na eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ wu alesi wònɔ tsã.

I never would have been able to do that.	Anye ne nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma gbeɖe o.
It’s very clear.	Eme kɔ nyuie.
I can’t be here with you	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afisia kpli wò o
Many of them did so.	Wo dometɔ geɖe wɔe nenema.
The worst is now over.	Nusi gblẽ wu la wu enu fifia.
I remember your face now	Meɖo ŋku wò mo dzi azɔ
Now go away.	Azɔ dzo.
They are all the same.	Wo katã wole ɖeka.
Now, it will be in one form or another.	Fifia, anɔ nɔnɔme aɖe me alo bubu me.
People had very little money.	Ga sue aɖe koe nɔ amewo si.
I don’t know who he is	Nyemenya amesi wònye o
I never had my own gun.	Nye ŋutɔ nye tu menɔ asinye kpɔ o.
Some of them for one year and more.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo ƒe ɖeka kple esi wu nenema.
I don’t seem important enough.	Edze abe nyemele vevie ale gbegbe o ene.
I have to stay in shape	Ele be manɔ nɔnɔme me
I didn’t understand what was going on	Nyemese nu si nɔ edzi yim la gɔme o
I felt a thousand years old	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mexɔ ƒe akpe ɖeka
I can definitely handle it tonight and all day tomorrow.	Mate ŋu akpɔ edzi le zã sia me kple ŋkeke bliboa etsɔ godoo.
But not much.	Gake menye geɖe o.
I don’t know how many days have passed.	Nyemenya ŋkeke nenie va yi o.
A very nice guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I hope to finally find out who that something is	Mele mɔ kpɔm mlɔeba be mava nya amesi nane ma nye
That’s not what works for me.	Menye emae nye nusi wɔa dɔ nam o.
For years he had not had one.	Ƒe geɖe enye sia si ɖeke menɔ esi o.
I just took a chance and ended up here	Ðeko metsɔ mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe eye meva wu enu ɖe ​​afisia
I think this is possible	Mesusu be esia anya wɔ
It could be any other book.	Ate ŋu anye agbalẽ bubu ɖesiaɖe hã.
I want to play that like there’s no tomorrow	Medi be maƒo nya ma abe etsɔ aɖeke meli o ene
He rubbed his face with one hand.	Etsɔ asi ɖeka ƒo eƒe mo.
I'm not so sure about that now	Nyemeka ɖe nya ma dzi nenema gbegbe fifia o
I think that should work.	Mesusu be ele be ema nawɔ dɔ.
That doesn’t work for me.	Ema mewɔa dɔ nam o.
I didn’t have a lot of time	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe menɔ asinye o
He had never done it before and he now had an idea.	Mewɔe kpɔ o eye eya fifia susu aɖe le esi.
Row.	Akpa.
Money is money.	Ga nye ga.
I have never felt so alive	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be mele agbe nenema gbegbe o
You can’t expect that, no one can.	Màte ŋu akpɔ mɔ na ema o, ame aɖeke mate ŋui o.
I needed to get them out of it	Ehiã be maɖe wo ɖa le eme
I can’t work on this right now	Nyemate ŋu awɔ dɔ tso esia ŋu fifia o
That just takes time.	Ðeko ema bia ɣeyiɣi.
I think that’s simple enough	Mesusu be ema le bɔbɔe ale gbegbe
Ultimately, he didn’t.	Mlɔeba la, mewɔe nenema o.
I just needed a nice place to live.	Ðeko mehiã teƒe nyui aɖe si manɔ.
I have to live.	Ele be manɔ agbe.
I’m older than that.	Metsi wu.
I don’t know myself	Nyemenya ɖokuinye o
A new rule here, a policy there	Se yeye aɖe le afisia, ɖoɖo aɖe le afima
Now that makes sense.	Fifia susu le nya ma me.
There will be blood.	Ʋu anɔ anyi.
It’s not exactly working.	Menye ɖe wòle dɔ wɔm tututu o.
His hand pressed to his mouth.	Eƒe asi te ɖe eƒe nu ŋu.
This statement may actually be false.	Nya sia ate ŋu anye alakpa ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I can’t tell you anything else	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya bubu aɖeke na wò o
I think he might know what to do	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ anya nusi wòawɔ
I was so different.	Menɔ teƒe bubu ale gbegbe.
And there’s a good reason for that.	Eye susu nyui aɖe li si tae.
I fell in love with him	Mete eƒe nu lé dzi nam ale gbegbe
I did that a few times	Mewɔe nenema zi ʋɛ aɖewo
It’s obviously worth it.	Edze ƒã be edze.
I was hoping you could help me with something	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye le nane me
I have to say that’s great	Ele nam be magblɔ be nya ma nyo ŋutɔ
A very long summer.	Dzomeŋɔli didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
Some ran past him.	Ame aɖewo ƒu du to eŋu.
There is a lot of good news in it.	Nya nyui geɖe le eme.
It was just the way things were.	Ale si nuwo nɔ koe wònɔ.
You are also a blood.	Wò hã ènye ʋu.
Anything like that.	Nusianu si le abe ema ene.
I probably should have said this earlier	Anɔ eme be ɖe wòle be magblɔ nya sia do ŋgɔ hafi
I was just so angry with him	Ðeko medo dziku ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe
I’m glad I have it.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ele asinye.
I looked forward to that so much	Mekpɔ mɔ na ema ale gbegbe
I told him everything	Megblɔ nya sia nya nɛ
Just for this week.	Kwasiɖa sia ko ta.
I feel it now.	Mese le ɖokuinye me fifia.
Work on it.	Wɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
I wanted to be surprised	Medi be wòawɔ nuku nam
One more death.	Ku ɖeka ake.
I think we can do it	Mesusu be míate ŋu awɔe
But I’m not so sure	Gake nyemeka ɖe edzi nenema gbegbe o
But it’s not exactly that.	Gake menye nenema tututu o.
I had no idea what he was looking for	Nyemenya nu si dim wònɔ o
I was in a very happy place now	Menɔ teƒe si dzidzɔ le ŋutɔ fifia
He won’t talk about me, you know.	Maƒo nu le ŋunye o, ènya.
Here, one last chance.	Le afisia la, mɔnukpɔkpɔ mamlɛtɔ ɖeka.
I’m not making that up	Menye nyee le nya ma wɔm o
Only two of them were as close as he could get.	Wo dometɔ eve koe te ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu alesi wòate ŋui.
I did a good job there.	Mewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe le afima.
I would have said the same thing	Anye ne megblɔ nya ma ke hafi
He has a pretty good idea of ​​what’s going on.	Nusi le edzi yim ƒe susu nyui aɖe le esi.
A point emerges from this case	Nya aɖe do tso nya sia me
I have something to say	Nya aɖe le asinye magblɔ
That usually doesn’t work out very well.	Zi geɖe la, ema mewɔa dɔ nyuie boo o.
Or he can’t.	Alo mate ŋui o.
I'm in the car and I'm on my way.	Mele ʋua me eye mele mɔ dzi.
It was a pleasure to be with them.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be menɔ wo gbɔ.
I could have escaped	Anye ne mate ŋu asi le eme hafi
Come on, tell me how you are.	Va, gblɔ ale si nèle nam.
I was too old.	Metsi akpa.
Just like him.	Abe eya ko ene.
This can help you to make your life easier too.	Esia ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò be wò agbe hã nanɔ bɔbɔe na wò.
I couldn’t wait to try one	Nyemete ŋu nɔ mɔ kpɔm be mate ɖeka kpɔ o
Now listen, man.	Azɔ ɖo to, ame.
It looks like something new!.	Edze abe nu yeye ene!.
They will be organized in a systematic manner.	Woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ɖoɖo nu.
I was furious and angry	Medo dziku vevie eye medo dziku
I made an appointment at one	Meɖo ɣeyiɣi aɖe ɖi le ɖeka
I am the teacher.	Nyee nye nufiala la.
They are doing things.	Wole nuwo wɔm.
Looking forward to our next project.	Míele mɔ kpɔm na míaƒe dɔ si gbɔna.
He can’t do that himself.	Eya ŋutɔ mate ŋu awɔ ema o.
I wanted to do something else	Medi be mawɔ nu bubu aɖe
It can be a bad thing.	Ate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ.
This is impossible to happen.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I couldn’t stand doing that	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe ema wɔwɔ nu o
Not so much today.	Menye nenema gbegbe egbea o.
I think it will be good for you	Mesusu be anyo na wò
It can be overwhelming.	Ate ŋu axɔ aƒe ɖe ame me.
But I have some ideas that just might work	Gake susu aɖewo le asinye siwo ate ŋu awɔ dɔ ko
I think that’s amazing	Mesusu be esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
It didn’t really surprise me.	Mewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
There was very little blood.	Ʋu sue aɖe koe nɔ afima.
I almost fell from behind	Medze anyi tso megbe kloe
I never wanted to know	Nyemedi be manya gbeɖe o
There’s a lot here	Nu geɖe le afisia
He couldn’t stop it.	Mete ŋu tsi enu o.
I love summer and winter	Dzomeŋɔli kple dzomeŋɔli dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
I don’t need to be here	Mehiã be manɔ afisia o
Much more than that.	Nu geɖe wu ema.
I asked what was going on.	Mebia nukae nɔ edzi yim hã.
I couldn’t say anything.	Nyemete ŋu gblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I don’t trust them, never have.	Nyemeka ɖe wo dzi o, nyemeka ɖe wo dzi kpɔ o.
I wish he hadn’t done that though	Ne ɖe mewɔe nenema o la, anye ne mewɔe nenema o ke hã
If you have a change of heart, please get in touch.	Ne dzi trɔ la, taflatse ƒo ka na wò.
Very big guy, but man	Ŋutsu gã aɖe ŋutɔ, gake ŋutsu
Consider what happened to them.	Kpɔ nusi dzɔ ɖe wo dzi ɖa.
Not just rarely, but often.	Menye ƒã ko o, ke zi geɖe hã.
I approached him but things didn’t work out.	Mete ɖe eŋu gake nuwo meva yi nyuie o.
It wouldn’t have occurred to me.	Anye ne meva susu me nam o.
I know we will work well together	Menya be míawɔ dɔ nyuie ɖekae
I hope you enjoy it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò
I actually needed to see people.	Le nyateƒe me la, ehiã be makpɔ amewo.
I want to be amazing at something	Medi be mawɔ nuku le nane me
I doubt you have much money on hand	Meke ɖi be ga geɖe le asiwò le asiwò
I think that would be really neat	Mesusu be ema anye nusi woawɔ le ɖoɖo nu ŋutɔŋutɔ
I no longer have this problem	Kuxi sia megale ŋunye o
You are not me’.	Menye nyee nènye o’.
I will definitely do it	Mawɔe godoo
But I have something else that might interest you	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã le asinye si ate ŋu adzɔ dzi na wò
I can’t do this.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia o.
There is only space between them.	Teƒe koe le wo dome.
I told you about it	Megblɔ eŋu nya na mi
I don’t know what came over me	Nyemenya nu si va dzinye o
We have a rule of thumb.	Se aɖe le mía si.
i was never sure what that was.	nyemeka ɖe nusi ema nye dzi gbeɖe o.
It surprised me, though.	Ewɔ nuku nam, gake.
I have lost people.	Amewo bu nam kpɔ.
There is a large house there.	Aƒe gã aɖe le afima.
It’s a pretty big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I really need to go home.	Ele be mayi aƒeme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Only one thing could have done this.	Nu ɖeka koe ate ŋu awɔ esia hafi.
I said no food.	Megblɔ be nuɖuɖu aɖeke meli o.
This was a big deal for him.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe nɛ.
Some of the people who worked here, well.	Ame siwo wɔ dɔ le afisia la dometɔ aɖewo, nyuie.
I can’t do anything	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o
I’m not sure which one, actually.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be kae o, le nyateƒe me.
At the moment, he is not there.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, mele afima o.
I want to be like him	Medi be manɔ abe eya ke ene
It just isn’t.	Ðeko wòle nenema o.
That doesn’t count here either.	Ema hã mexɔ asi le afisia o.
I think he did a pretty good job	Mesusu be ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ
I can’t be mad at that guy	Nyemate ŋu anɔ dziku dom ɖe ŋutsu ma ŋu o
But this isn’t surprising.	Gake esia mewɔ nuku o.
But he didn’t think it would happen here.	Gake mesusu be adzɔ le afisia o.
I could have controlled myself better	Anye ne mate ŋu aɖu ɖokuinye dzi nyuie wu hafi
That’s not true, but it doesn’t matter.	Ema menye nyateƒe o, gake mehiã o.
There would be no other time.	Anye ne ɣeyiɣi bubu aɖeke manɔ anyi o.
I am interested in someone.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na ame.
That was a little too close.	Ema te ɖe eŋu vie akpa.
I couldn’t stop though	Nyemete ŋu tɔ te o ke hã
I actually have that machine in my head.	Le nyateƒe me la, mɔ̃ ma le nye ta me.
It was a huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖee wònye.
I don’t want to stay	Nyemedi be manɔ anyi o
I can bring you together	Mate ŋu aƒo mi nu ƒu ɖekae
I know all these parts well	Menya akpa siawo katã nyuie
A small part of him welcomed this	Eƒe akpa sue aɖe do dzidzɔ ɖe esia ŋu
This is not required of him.	Esia mebia tso esi o.
That’s what he really likes.	Emae nye nusi dzɔa dzi nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I also need some money	Mehiã ga aɖewo hã
I’m not in this for the money.	Menye ga la tae mele esia me o.
I also needed to be in his company	Ehiã hã be manɔ eƒe ha me
I was hoping for something, but nothing came	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na nane, gake naneke meva o
I stabbed up with the point of my sword	Metsɔ nye yi ƒe nu ƒo yi dzi
It’s too important right now.	Ele vevie akpa fifia.
It was too soon that I wasn’t tired yet.	Enye kaba akpa be ɖeɖi te ŋunye haɖe o.
And look at this idea.	Eye kpɔ susu sia ɖa.
I could have done better	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu hafi
The real truth lies somewhere in between.	Nyateƒea ŋutɔŋutɔ le afi aɖe le wo dome.
I couldn’t stop thinking about it	Nyemete ŋu dzudzɔ eŋu bubu o
I existed on my own	Menɔ anyi le nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye si
Please save me.	Taflatse ɖem.

I think this is a great point.	Mesusu be esia nye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Print another book.	Ta agbalẽ bubu aɖe.
I was just trying to explain	Ðeko menɔ agbagba dzem be maɖe eme
One project at a time.	Dɔ ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me.
I can tell exactly what happened	Mate ŋu anya nu si tututu dzɔ
I am very, very impressed	Mewɔa dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ, wɔa dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
I hope so.	Mele mɔ kpɔm nenema.
I don’t know why he was trying so hard	Nyemenya nu si tae wònɔ agbagba dzem vevie nenema gbegbe ɖo o
I had no one for so long	Ame aɖeke menɔ asinye ɣeyiɣi didi nenema gbegbe o
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe mía dzi ŋutɔ.
I don’t want to do it, ever.	Nyemedi be mawɔe o, gbeɖe o.
I thought we could eat together in the room	Mesusu be míate ŋu aɖu nu ɖekae le xɔa me
Stay with us.	Nɔ mía gbɔ.
It seems to be very much so.	Edze abe ɖe wòle nenema ŋutɔ ene.
I’m not ready for that kind of thing	Nyemele klalo na nu ma ƒomevi o
He didn’t know who was there.	Menya amesi nɔ afima o.
But he couldn’t stand it.	Gake mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
I want things in me	Medi be nuwo nanɔ menye
I can’t eat anyway	Nyemate ŋu aɖu nu le mɔ aɖeke nu o
This guy will get you.	Ŋutsu sia axɔ wò.
I fell in love with this city	Du sia ƒe nu lé dzi nam
This infuriated me	Esia do dziku nam
I have another reason	Susu bubu aɖe hã le asinye
That must have been a mistake.	Anɔ eme be vodada aɖee nye ema.
And he was completely different	Eye eya hã to vovo kura
I’m so glad you are too	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be wò hã nèle nenema
After a while, a voice spoke to me.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe la, gbe aɖe ƒo nu nam.
Night returned and yet it could not stop.	Zã trɔ gbɔ eye ke hã mete ŋu tɔ te o.
It's like this.	Ele alea.
It doesn’t make sense to me at all.	Susu mele eme nam kura o.
But it’s a big deal.	Gake enye nu gã aɖe.
I had been ready.	Menɔ klalo tsã.
This is the opposite.	Esia nye nusi to vovo na ema.
That’s a clear plan.	Ema nye ɖoɖo si me kɔ.
I felt strange.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mewɔ nuku o.

This can be close together.	Esia ate ŋu ate ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu.
I just took it all in	Ðeko mexɔ wo katã ɖe eme
However this is not necessarily a problem.	Ke hã esia menye kuxi kokoko o.
I just can’t do that to myself	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o
I felt it in my heart	Mese le ɖokuinye me le nye dzi me
I should never be happy	Mele be makpɔ dzidzɔ akpɔ gbeɖe o
I tried to reach out	Medze agbagba be mado asi ɖe eŋu
Similarly, use common sense here.	Nenema ke zã susu nyui le afisia hã.
I got my first job.	Mexɔ nye dɔ gbãtɔ.
But his mind is not so much.	Gake eƒe susu ya menye nenema gbegbe o.
It was quite a surprise.	Enye nusi wɔ nuku kura.
We are happy that he is in this school.	Enye dzidzɔ na mí be ele suku sia me.
That’s the worst part.	Emae nye akpa si gblẽ wu.
I couldn’t hear what happened	Nyemete ŋu se nusi dzɔ o
I thought I was going to get one	Mesusu be ɖeka xɔ ge
It seems to have exactly what you want.	Edze abe nu si tututu nèdi la le eme ene.
Not against him.	Menye ɖe eŋu o.
I’ve never felt anything close to this	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be naneke te ɖe esia ŋu o
I can be the same	Nye hã mate ŋu anɔ nenema
There’s just something between us	Nu aɖe koe le mía dome
But his face is not stone.	Gake eƒe mo menye kpe o.
I don’t know if it will work	Nyemenya nenye be awɔ dɔ o
He shouldn’t have been surprised.	Mele be wòawɔ nuku nɛ hafi o.
We can do better than that	Míate ŋu awɔ nu nyuie wu ema
I didn’t know what to say to him	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ nɛ o
I reached for his car	Medo asi ɖe eƒe ʋua gbɔ
I don’t really know how to do it.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Great location, reasonable price.	Teƒe nyui aɖe, asi si sɔ.
I couldn’t think of them	Nyemete ŋu bu wo ŋu o
I want to tell you everything	Medi be magblɔ nusianu na mi
I think that’s better for him	Mesusu be ema nyo nɛ wu
I can't find it though	Nyemate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu o gake
I wasn’t happy, exactly	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o, tututu
There wasn’t much he could do.	Nu boo aɖeke menɔ anyi wòawɔ o.
I had two more in my house	Eve bubu nɔ asinye le nye aƒe me
But the police reported.	Gake kpovitɔwo ka nya ta.
They had a point.	Nya aɖe nɔ wo si.
I need time to make another plan	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi be mawɔ ɖoɖo bubu
I want to let it all go	Medi be maɖe asi le wo katã ŋu
I’ve done that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ.
Quite a few of them did not.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ mewɔe nenema o.
I wish you a good life	Medi be agbe nyui nanɔ asiwò
Anyone can do that.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu awɔ ema.
So, none of them do this.	Eya ta, wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔa esia o.
It’s what he’s going to do.	Enye nusi wòawɔ.
I just felt helpless, that was all	Ðeko mese le ɖokuinye me be nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o, ema koe nye ema
You wrote me that.	Wòe ŋlɔ nya ma nam.
However, there is a strategy that remains.	Ke hã, aɖaŋu aɖe li si gakpɔtɔ li.
I am the source of some	Nyee nye amesi gbɔ ame aɖewo tso
I can be anyone now	Mate ŋu anye ame sia ame fifia
He hasn’t seen any of that plan yet.	Mekpɔ ɖoɖo ma dometɔ aɖeke haɖe o.
I can kill you too	Mate ŋu awu wò hã
Tell him that too.	Gblɔ nya ma nɛ hã.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I want to know if anyone else is here	Medi be manya ne ame bubu aɖe le afisia
I really enjoyed that book.	Agbalẽ ma do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
That’s about it.	Ema ku ɖe eŋu.
The enthusiasm was gone.	Dzo si nɔ eme la nu yi.
Maybe it can help you at least a little bit.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò vie ya teti.
They have a job and a life.	Dɔ kple agbe le wo si.
A nice guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖe.
We can still be wrong about it, you know.	Míate ŋu anye vodada le eŋu kokoko, ènya.
I started to get angry	Meva nɔ dziku dom
We have a lot in common.	Nu geɖe le mía dome si sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
But still, it was a big mistake.	Gake ke hã, vodada gã aɖee wònye.
Consider what we do know though.	Bu nusi míenya ŋu kpɔ gake.
I did pretty well, actually	Mewɔe nyuie ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me
None of them can be further from the truth.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu nyateƒea o.
I am the steady good one	Nyee nye ame nyui si li ke la
I couldn’t be happier with everything.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe nusianu ŋu wu ema o.
I think someone might get up there	Mesusu be ame aɖe ate ŋu afɔ ɖe afima
I've had a lot of fun so far.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ vaseɖe afisia.
It seemed like everything that had ever happened to me had happened twice.	Edze abe nusianu si dzɔ ɖe dzinye kpɔ la dzɔ zi eve ene.
I think things are going so far	Mesusu be nuwo le edzi yim vaseɖe fifia
You have to have someone.	Ele be ame aɖe nanɔ asiwò.
I'll call you there.	Maƒo ka na wò le afima.
I was often late for work	Zi geɖe la, metsi megbe le dɔme
Which is what you are looking for.	Nusi nye nusi dim nèle.
But the same thing happened.	Gake nu ma ke dzɔ.
Finally, he has someone.	Mlɔeba la, ame aɖe le esi.
There are no guys like me either.	Ŋutsu siwo le abe nye ene hã mele afima o.
This is just my own work.	Nye ŋutɔ nye dɔ koe esia nye.
I just felt out of place	Ðeko mese le ɖokuinye me be nyemele teƒe aɖeke o
I need to figure out what my legal name is	Ele be makpɔ ŋkɔ si nye nye le se nu
Nobody is nobody.	Ame aɖeke menye ame aɖeke o.
I think it’s possible though	Mesusu be ate ŋu adzɔ gake
I felt he was right in that	Mese le ɖokuinye me be eƒe nya sɔ le nya ma me
That’s a tough one, really tough.	Ema nye sesẽ aɖe, sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I was also very upset	Mete ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ hã
And now this place.	Eye fifia teƒe sia.
He did so much for so many people.	Ewɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ na ame geɖe ŋutɔ.
Forget who he’s meeting.	Ŋlɔ ame si wòle go dom kplii la be.
It was a trick.	Aɖaŋu aɖee wònye.

He was a man who did it.	Enye ŋutsu aɖe si wɔe.

I should have explained more	Ðe wòle be maɖe eme geɖe wu hafi
But it wasn’t what he wanted.	Gake menye nusi dim wònɔ ye o.
I couldn’t say anything else	Nyemete ŋu gblɔ nya bubu aɖeke o
No bad words, mind.	Nya gbegblẽ aɖeke meli o, susu.
I'm going to give it to you anyway.	Mele etsɔ ge na wò to mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Nyemenya nusi le edzi yim o.
I just can’t help myself.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o.
I had to do what everyone else wanted	Ele be mawɔ nu si ame bubu ɖesiaɖe di
No one else knows where we are, really.	Ame bubu aɖeke menya afisi míele o, le nyateƒe me.
I kept that in mind.	Metsɔ nya ma nɔ susu me nam.
There is nothing to be done for him.	Naneke meli woawɔ nɛ o.
I haven’t seen you in a while	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia nyemekpɔ wò o
I need to find out more about it.	Ele be makpɔ nu geɖe tso eŋu.
I don’t know who he is	Nyemenya amesi wònye o
I would love to do that	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔe nenema
Maybe he liked it.	Ðewohĩ edze eŋu.
There is no other kind.	Menye ƒomevi bubu aɖeke meli o.
A voice came from somewhere behind them	Gbe aɖe ɖi tso afi aɖe le wo megbe
I didn’t see what happened	Nyemekpɔ nusi dzɔ o
I really want to do it.	Medi be mawɔe nyateƒe.
Thank you, thank you very much.	Akpe na wò, akpe na wò ŋutɔ.
But it’s not too bad.	Gake menye nu gbegblẽ boo aɖeke o.
It was very pleasant to him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
On the nyo.	Ku nyo.
Maybe he is somewhere now.	Ðewohĩ ele afi aɖe fifia.
It’s not worth it now.	Menye nusi dze fifia o.
He was the one who helped her.	Enye ame si kpe ɖe eŋu.
And of course, this strategy is very effective.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, aɖaŋu sia wɔa dɔ ŋutɔ.
This time, just the truth.	Fifia ya, nyateƒea koe.
Everyone was at home.	Amesiame nɔ aƒeme.
I've had a few of them.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ asinye kpɔ.
It hurt a little.	Eve enu vie.
I expected too much.	Mekpɔ mɔ na nu geɖe akpa.
I felt very, very small and very, very nervous.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mele sue ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ eye metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
I am not alone at all.	Menye ɖeka koe mele kura o.
Close, close enough.	Te ɖe eŋu, te ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe.
How great would that be!?.	Aleke gbegbe ema anye nu gã aɖee!?.
I never understood the hair thing	Nyemese ɖa ƒe nya la gɔme kpɔ o
I'm not going to like this	Nyemele esia ƒe nu lé dzi nam o
We’re not going to kill you.	Míele wò wu ge o.
I made one for him	Mewɔ ɖeka nɛ
But it was a dead rifle.	Gake enye tu si ku.
I was very worried the whole way	Metsi dzi vevie le mɔ bliboa dzi
There is very little damage.	Nu sue aɖe koe gblẽ le eŋu.
That didn’t upset me too much	Ema medo dziku nam akpa o
That way, people work better.	To mɔ sia dzi la, amewo wɔa dɔ nyuie wu.
I grew up alone	Nye ɖeka koe tsi va tsi
As it is, it is.	Abe ale si wòle ene.
I have done this kind of thing many times	Mewɔ nu sia ƒomevi zi geɖe
We know where they are going.	Míenya afi si yim wole.
This cannot be proved.	Esia mate ŋu aɖo kpe edzi o.
He has the word.	Nya la le esi.
There is really nothing new.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu yeye aɖeke meli o.
I can’t tell you how good that made me feel	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ alesi gbegbe ema na mese le ɖokuinye me nyuie o
I felt satisfied with my job	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dɔa dze ŋunye
There is so much for a child to do there.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ li na ɖevi be wòawɔ le afima.
I know exactly what happened.	Menya nusi tututu dzɔ.
I stayed with each of them for months	Menɔ wo dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe gbɔ ɣleti geɖe
Its not that hard, and guess what! 	Eƒe menye nu sesẽ nenema gbegbe o, eye bu eŋu kpɔ!
I don’t think there’s much he can say about it	Mesusu be nya geɖe meli wòate ŋu agblɔ tso eŋu o
I think it’s a good thing.	Mesusu be enye nu nyui aɖe.
I could never understand them	Nyemete ŋu se wo gɔme gbeɖe o
Maybe this is a mistake.	Ðewohĩ vodada aɖee nye esia.
He was every man for himself.	Enye ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe na eɖokui.
I think he did a pretty good job	Mesusu be ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe ŋutɔ
I see something good here about you and me	Mekpɔ nu nyui aɖe le afisia tso mía kple wò ŋu
I work in the market	Mewɔa dɔ le asi me
In fact, it has no name at all	Le nyateƒe me la, ŋkɔ aɖeke mele eŋu kura o
Now he is on a completely different footing.	Fifia ele afɔ bubu dzi kura.
I am not sure how .	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be aleke .
To do something different with my life.	Be mawɔ nane si to vovo na nye agbe.
And it really worked.	Eye ewɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I really do like you	Mewɔa nu abe wò ene ŋutɔŋutɔ
I can get on board with that	Mate ŋu aɖo ʋua me kple ema
This is personal for you, not me.	Esia nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ na wò, ke menye na nye o.
I think for once it would be great	Mesusu be zi ɖeka la, anyo ŋutɔ
It had been wonderful.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ tsã.
I might have a night soon	Ðewohĩ zã aɖe anɔ asinye kaba
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
I needed something like that in my death	Mehiã nane si le abe ema ene le nye ku me
Make it happen.	Wɔe ɖa.
But there are at least two problems.	Gake kuxi eve ya teti li.
I might hit someone instead of you	Ðewohĩ maƒo ame aɖe tsɔ wu wò
Something seemed off with me this morning.	Edze abe nane tsi tre ɖe ŋunye ŋdi sia ene.
Maybe there was one left.	Ðewohĩ ɖeka gakpɔtɔ nɔ anyi.
How is it?.	Aleke wòle?.
Go back to my room.	Trɔ yi nye xɔ me.
No one else can do this.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ esia o.
That didn’t turn out so well.	Ema meva eme nyuie nenema gbegbe o.
I wanted to do it for myself	Medi be mawɔe na ɖokuinye
I was finally able to get out	Meva te ŋu do go mlɔeba
Only the people who lived there really know what it was like.	Ame siwo nɔ afi ma koe nya alesi wònɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
In a few .	Le ʋɛ aɖewo me la .
This year the	Le ƒe sia me la .
I couldn’t win anything	Nyemete ŋu ɖu dzi le naneke me o
Come on, here.	Va, le afisia.
Believe me, this is true.	Xɔ dzinye se, nya sia nye nyateƒe.
Maybe I can help	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu
I still have a chance	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gakpɔtɔ le asinye
More is possible.	Nu geɖe wu ate ŋu adzɔ.
I can’t let go either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu o
Or a new way.	Alo mɔ yeye aɖe.
I have experienced many things	Mekpɔ nu geɖe teƒe kpɔ
It is a very difficult thing to deal with	Enye nusi sesẽ ŋutɔ be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu
Or just too little.	Alo nu sue aɖe ko akpa.
At that point in time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
Thank you for answering my question.	Akpe na mi ame siwo ɖo nye nya la ŋu.
It’s easier this way.	Ele bɔbɔe wu le mɔ sia nu.
I am definitely going to buy more.	Mele nu geɖe ƒle ge godoo.
I’m so glad I had so much fun.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mekpɔ dzidzɔ alea gbegbe.
In the background.	Le megbe la.
I can’t, or anyway, not yet.	Nyemate ŋui o, alo le mɔ sia mɔ nu la, nyemete ŋui haɖe o.
Not for a week.	Menye kwasiɖa ɖeka o.
He wouldn’t have wanted that.	Anye ne madi nenema o.
Be careful of it.	Kpɔ nyuie le eŋu.
It was a huge waste of time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ gã aɖe.
I was also surprised that he came alone	Ewɔ nuku nam hã be eya ɖeka va
Save the city.	Ðe du la.
I don’t know exactly what it is	Nyemenya nusi tututu wònye o
A metal hand reached out	Ga asi aɖe do asi ɖa
We were really nothing to each other.	Míenye naneke ŋutɔŋutɔ na mía nɔewo o.
I would have liked to make room for it	Anye ne madi be mawɔ teƒe nɛ hafi
I want to get out there, and I will do it now.	Medi be mado le afima, eye mawɔe fifia.
It never really came to anything.	Meva ɖo naneke gbɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
Many people are looking for work	Ame geɖe le dɔ dim
There are two reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae.
I know you’re tired.	Menya be ɖeɖi te ŋuwò.
He was a very advanced person.	Enye amesi de ŋgɔ ŋutɔ.
I think you will enjoy it	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò
I think everyone is just tired.	Mesusu be ɖeɖi te amesiame ŋu ko.
I tried everything.	Mete nusianu kpɔ.
It would be too small.	Anye sue akpa.
There is still some work to be done.	Dɔ aɖewo gakpɔtɔ li siwo wòle be woawɔ.
I had my face in my hands.	Nye mo nɔ asinye.
He couldn’t understand what was going on either.	Mete ŋu se nusi nɔ edzi yim hã gɔme o.
You don’t have to do that if you don’t want to.	Mehiã be nàwɔ nu ma ne mèdi o.
I knew that could never happen	Menya be ema mate ŋu adzɔ gbeɖe o
I found another similar hole	Mekpɔ do bubu si sɔ kple esia
I actually heard these words with my own ears.	Le nyateƒe me la, mese nya siawo kple nye ŋutɔ nye to.
I can’t figure out what he’s going to do	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi wòawɔ o
This is not a new phenomenon.	Esia menye nu yeye o.
He had never touched her, and she had never touched him.	Meka asi eŋu kpɔ o, eye eya hã meka asi eŋu kpɔ o.
I couldn’t finish it	Nyemete ŋu wu enu o
I know the right people.	Menya ame siwo sɔ.
Now many people have come to know this	Azɔ ame geɖe va nya nya sia
Practical help makes this difficult.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ na esia sesẽ.
But not more than that.	Gake menye esi wu nenema o.
You may eventually die.	Àte ŋu ava ku mlɔeba.
It seems to surprise you.	Edze abe ewɔ nuku na wò ene.
I had to be there one last time	Ele be manɔ afima zi mamlɛtɔ
I found you shortly after that fire	Meke ɖe ŋuwò le dzo ma megbe kpuie
We have no problems.	Kuxi aɖeke mele mía ŋu o.
Put himself somewhere else.	Tsɔ eɖokui da ɖe teƒe bubu.
I just want to know more	Ðeko medi be manya nu geɖe wu
I can reward us all	Mate ŋu aɖo eteƒe na mí katã
I think that’s amazing.	Mesusu be esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I thought, that we were missing something	Mesusu be, be nane le mía ŋu tom
He ran, too.	Eya hã ƒu du.
He doesn’t look like me.	Medze abe nye ene o.
I don’t know what to make of it all	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso wo katã ŋu o
I felt I had to find you	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ele nam be madi wò
It’s a big role for you.	Enye akpa gã aɖe na wò.
I wasn’t supposed to be here last night	Menye ɖe wòle be mava afisia le zã si va yi me o
Clearly, there is much to do.	Edze ƒã be nu geɖe li woawɔ.
I definitely took some time for you	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe na wò godoo
He thought of it alone.	Eya ɖeka koe bu eŋu.
I couldn’t have done this without him	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia eya manɔmee o
I did want that in some cases	Medi nenema le go aɖewo me nyateƒe
The shape of his head is amazing.	Ale si eƒe ta le la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I want you more than anything else	Medi wò wu nu bubu ɖesiaɖe
Everyone is like that.	Amewo katã le nenema.
We may not be able to live like that.	Ðewohĩ míate ŋu anɔ agbe nenema o.
A big part of me wants to denounce it.	Nye akpa gã aɖe di be maƒo nu tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
I decided to deal with him separately	Meɖoe be mawɔ nu kplii ɖe vovo
But my face is hard.	Gake nye mo sesẽ.
Write them all down.	Ŋlɔ wo katã ɖi.
I held out my hand.	Medo nye asi ɖa.
Otherwise, it is.	Ne menye nenema o la.
That person only exists in your imagination.	Wò susu me koe ame ma li.
I had to get out of the room	Ele be mado le xɔa me
I just didn’t know what he wanted	Ðeko nyemenya nusi dim wònɔ o
I’m so glad to see you	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mekpɔ wò
I never got a good look at you last night.	Nyemekpɔ wò nyuie kpɔ le zã si va yi me o.
I wanted to try.	Medi be mate kpɔ.
I was protecting you	Menɔ ta kpɔm na wò
I might have some good things to say.	Ðewohĩ nya nyui aɖewo anɔ asinye magblɔ.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
He just made a funny face.	Ðeko wòwɔ mo si doa dzidzɔ na ame.
Look, that was a bad day.	Kpɔ ɖa, ŋkeke gbegblẽ aɖee nye ema.
That’s just the truth.	Nyateƒea koe nye ema.
Literally, like a child.	Le nyateƒe me la, abe ɖevi ene.
I can’t tell you that	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma na wò o
No one ever believed them.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ wo dzi se kpɔ o.
I liked the chapter on hard work.	Ta si ku ɖe dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ ŋu la dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
If only everyone didn’t know	Ne ɖe amesiame menya o la, anye ne mewɔe nenema o
I remember hearing that he would	Meɖo ŋku edzi be mese be awɔe nenema
I finally said that.	Megblɔ nya ma mlɔeba.
I don’t know what I’m going to be like	Nyemenya alesi manɔ o
It can be useful.	Ate ŋu aɖe vi.
That used to annoy me	Ema doa dziku nam tsã
I couldn’t do it though	Nyemete ŋu wɔe o gake
That’s his character.	Emae nye eƒe nɔnɔme.
I have become smaller than ever	Meva le sue wu tsã
It’s not because of him either.	Menye eya hã tae o.
Death is never the last word for us.	Ku menye nya mamlɛtɔ na mí gbeɖe o.
That didn’t work.	Ema mewɔ dɔ o.
Now it is a reality.	Fifia enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We had quite a root.	Ke aɖe nɔ mía si ŋutɔ.
Now everything has changed.	Fifia nusianu trɔ.
I know you are new to this.	Menya be ènye ame yeye le esia me.
I will need to do something soon	Ahiã be mawɔ nane kpuie
Today, almost all of them do.	Egbea la, wo katã kloe wɔa esia.
I know you’re on the wrong track	Menya be èle mɔ gbegblẽ dzi
I almost lost my job	Dɔ ge le asinye kloe
It seems impossible.	Edze abe mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.
It is working fine for me.	Ele dɔ wɔm nyuie nam.
I guarantee you there will be something for everyone	Meka ɖe edzi na wò be nane anɔ anyi na amesiame
I didn’t know it was possible	Nyemenya be anya wɔ o
This building still exists	Xɔ sia gakpɔtɔ li
I had to meet them.	Ele nam be mado go wo.
I can’t take care of me, besides him	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzinye o, eya hã tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu
I gave you everything	Metsɔ nusianu na wò
He had been very pleased with this.	Esia dzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ tsã.
Indeed.	Le nyateƒe me.
He never said anything about it though.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke tso eŋu kpɔ o gake.
I don’t think this is a good morning	Nyemesusu be ŋdi nyui aɖee nye esia o
It was a huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖee wònye.
I met with him last month	Medo go kplii le ɣleti si va yi me
There was no money to fight over.	Ga aɖeke menɔ anyi si ŋu woawɔ avu le o.
I put my hand on his neck	Metsɔ nye asi da ɖe eƒe kɔ ŋu
I hope this technique can solve that for me.	Mekpɔ mɔ be aɖaŋu sia ate ŋu akpɔ nya ma gbɔ nam.
We have dignity.	Bubu le mía ŋu.
I had to see what happened	Ele be makpɔ nusi dzɔ
Say what you think, but sign your name.	Gblɔ nusi nèsusu, gake de asi wò ŋkɔ te.
But there is nothing to do.	Gake naneke meli woawɔ o.
You can’t do it.	Màte ŋu awɔe o.
We could have done it.	Míate ŋu awɔe hafi.
I remember my first day here	Meɖo ŋku nye ŋkeke gbãtɔ dzi le afisia
I have tried this.	Mete esia kpɔ.
Over there, that’s better.	Le afima la, ema nyo wu.
It was very impressive	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
I started by doing that.	Medze egɔme kple ema wɔwɔ.
I didn’t hear anything at all	Nyemese naneke kura o
That sounds almost normal to me.	Ema ɖi nusi sɔ nam kloe.
In fact, you are helping me.	Le nyateƒe me la, èle kpekpeɖeŋu nam.
Only a few left.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe dzo.
I have charged you.	Metsɔ nya ɖe ŋuwò.
All my people did it.	Nye amewo katã wɔe.
I guess it’s just your kind	Mesusu be wò ƒomevi koe wònye
And we had a lot of help.	Eye kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe hã nɔ mía si.
I had to deal with it as soon as possible	Ele nam be mawɔ nu kplii kaba ale si mate ŋui
I would be happy for that.	Adzɔ dzi nam ɖe ema ta.
Here, not so much.	Le afisia la, menye nenema gbegbe o.
Also that he had a gun.	Azɔ hã be tu nɔ esi.
But not like you.	Gake menye abe wò ene o.
But this won’t work.	Gake esia mawɔ dɔ o.
The police arrived.	Kpovitɔwo va ɖo afima.
I don’t know what’s going to happen to this house.	Nyemenya nu si ava dzɔ ɖe aƒe sia dzi o.
In a sense, this is both true and important.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, esia nye nyateƒe eye wòle vevie hã.
I think there’s a job here	Mesusu be dɔ aɖe le afisia
A few weeks passed	Kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo va yi
But his attitude has changed dramatically.	Gake eƒe nɔnɔme trɔ ŋutɔ.
We never had that.	Ema menɔ mía ŋu kpɔ o.
Painful but comfortable.	Vevie gake eƒe dzi dze eme.
I couldn’t eat at all either	Nye hã nyemete ŋu ɖu nu kura o
He was one of many children.	Enye ɖevi geɖe dometɔ ɖeka.
That’s not necessarily a bad thing.	Menye ɖe ema nye nu gbegblẽ kokoko o.
I really need you right now	Mehiã wò ŋutɔŋutɔ fifia
It’s just not there anymore, not for me.	Ðeko megale afima o, menye na nye o.
I can still be active.	Mate ŋu anɔ dɔ dzi kokoko.
I saw the whole thing	Mekpɔ nu bliboa
Be a man who knows what he wants.	Nye ŋutsu si nya nusi dim wòle.
Behind him.	Le megbe nɛ.
I tried very hard.	Medze agbagba vevie ŋutɔ.
I can’t do anything without help.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke kpekpeɖeŋu manɔmee o.
Clearly, this is not true.	Edze ƒã be esia menye nyateƒe o.
I think that’s what’s really weird	Mesusu be emae nye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ
I doubt anyone will be there	Meke ɖi be ame aɖe anɔ afima
Yet he had room to get out.	Ke hã teƒe nɔ esi wòate ŋu ado le eme.
But too much has changed.	Gake nu geɖe akpa trɔ.
Now, he has only one word.	Fifia, nya ɖeka koe le esi.
I can’t fight it or get away from it	Nyemate ŋu awɔ avu kplii alo asi le eŋu o
I'll do it tonight.	Mawɔe le zã sia me.
I was in his room	Menɔ eƒe xɔ me
I had to figure out a replacement	Ele be makpɔ ame aɖe si axɔ ɖe eteƒe la ɖa
And, now he is doing this to us.	Eye, fifia ele esia wɔm ɖe mía ŋu.
This really worked.	Esia wɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Often, over and over again.	Zi geɖe la, zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I glanced at them	Meɖe ŋku ɖe wo me
But the opposite is true.	Gake nusi to vovo kura na emae.
But he can at least talk.	Gake ate ŋu aƒo nu ya teti.
First time this has happened in a long time.	Zi gbãtɔ si esia dzɔ le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe megbe.
I worried about it for too long	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu ɣeyiɣi didi akpa
I can’t remember his last name.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ mamlɛtɔ dzi o.
He did a great job.	Ewɔ dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I will be there.	Manɔ afima.
This seems very difficult to do.	Edze abe esia wɔwɔ sesẽ ŋutɔ ene.
I wonder what’s wrong with him	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae le fu ɖem nɛ hã
You can’t do anything.	Màte ŋu awɔ naneke o.
But the opposite is true.	Gake nusi to vovo kura na emae.
I needed to do something about that, and fast	Ehiã be mawɔ nane tso ema ŋu, eye mawɔ kaba
I was doing things for him	Menɔ nuwo wɔm nɛ
This should not surprise us.	Mele be esia nawɔ nuku na mí o.
I hoped it wouldn’t bother them	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be maɖe fu na wo o
Write me a letter.	Ŋlɔ agbalẽ nam.
I'll call him to explain.	Maƒo ka nɛ be maɖe eme nɛ.
That seems to have helped some.	Edze abe ema kpe ɖe ame aɖewo ŋu ene.
And everything came to mind.	Eye nusianu va nɔ susu me nam.
It kind of worked out well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie le mɔ aɖe nu.
I always do that too	Nye hã mewɔa nenema ɣesiaɣi
This did not seem to be the case.	Edze abe esia menɔ nenema o ene.
I believe in you.	Mexɔ wò dzi se.
That was the voice of a king.	Emae nye fia aɖe ƒe gbe.
This is very difficult.	Esia sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I was never going to do this	Nyemele esia wɔ ge gbeɖe o
I want to do well with it	Medi be mawɔ nu nyuie le eŋu
This time is obviously a bit late.	Edze ƒã be ɣeyiɣi sia nye ɣeyiɣi si tsi megbe vie.
I really enjoyed this book	Agbalẽ sia do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
But you don’t know what you’re missing.	Gake mènya nusi bu na wò o.
And it’s not here.	Eye mele afisia o.
Thanks, but not necessary.	Akpe, gake mehiã o.
He didn’t do anything at all.	Mewɔ naneke kura o.
I have to go somewhere	Ele be mayi afi aɖe
I make a lot of mistakes	Mewɔa vodada geɖe
A year since it all began	Ƒe ɖeka tso esime nusianu dze egɔme
I couldn’t wait.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ lalam o.
I ended up in that job for years	Meva nɔ dɔ ma me ƒe geɖe
I'll tell you what this is	Magblɔ nusi nye esia na wò
But there’s something to it, really.	Gake nane le eme, le nyateƒe me.
I satisfied his every wish	Mekpɔ eƒe didi ɖesiaɖe gbɔ
This is probably due to two reasons.	Anɔ eme be susu eve aɖewo tae esia tso.
Use a man.	Zã ŋutsu.
I know they are happy	Menya be wole dzidzɔ kpɔm
You're here.	Èle afisia.
I thought the word was out about me.	Mesusu be nya la do go tso ŋunye.
He is going to have his say.	Ele eƒe nya gblɔ ge.
I know exactly what is going on.	Menya nusi tututu le edzi yim.
Nothing could be simpler.	Naneke mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe wu ema o.
In fact, the opposite happened.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae dzɔ.
He didn’t let go of her.	Meɖe asi le eŋu o.
As it was, it was.	Abe alesi wònɔ ene.
I don’t know where I’m going to end up.	Nyemenya afi si mava wu enu ɖo o.
I could stay there all day	Mate ŋu anɔ afima ŋkeke bliboa
I wanted it so, so, so badly	Medi vevie ale gbegbe, ale gbegbe, ale gbegbe
That’s the truth.	Emae nye nyateƒe.
It’s not the only thing wrong at all.	Menye eya koe nye nu gbegblẽ kura o.
I want to talk to you	Medi be maƒo nu kpli wò
Dress up if you can.	Do awu ne àte ŋui.
I work on them.	Mewɔa dɔ tso wo ŋu.
I need more and more.	Mehiã nu geɖe wu.
He had a clear strategy.	Aɖaŋu aɖe si me kɔ nyuie nɔ esi.
I couldn’t witness this	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ esia teƒe o
I had been waiting for that moment for a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia menɔ ɣeyiɣi ma lalam.
I lived for a very long time	Menɔ agbe ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ
There was a lot of blood.	Ʋu sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
He could have found someone.	Ate ŋu ake ɖe ame aɖe ŋu hafi.
I don’t know anything about this	Nyemenya naneke tso nya sia ŋu o
I felt like myself.	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye ene.
I couldn’t get through it	Nyemete ŋu to eme o
Everything has changed.	Nusianu trɔ.
I knew from the first time	Menya tso zi gbãtɔ ke
And it is	Eye wònye .
I started towards them	Medze egɔme ɖo ta wo gbɔ
I know about you and everything you do	Menya nu tso ŋuwò kple nu sia nu si nàwɔ
He can find that way.	Ate ŋu akpɔ mɔ ma.
If anyone has any idea what is going on.	Ne susu le ame aɖe si le nusi le edzi yim ŋu.
Now he is getting angry.	Fifia ele dziku dom.
They are going to be rejected.	Wole gbegbe ge.
I can handle this on my own.	Mate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ le ɖokuinye si.
I only work for myself	Nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye koe mewɔa dɔ na
I knew someone would take more time	Menya be ame aɖe axɔ ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu
As if no man had ever touched her in this way before.	Abe ɖe ŋutsu aɖeke meka asi eŋu le mɔ sia nu kpɔ o ene.
I'm glad I joined him tonight though	Edzɔ dzi nam be meva kpe ɖe eŋu le zã sia me gake
I'm sure it was just a mistake.	Meka ɖe edzi be vodada aɖe koe wònye.
I don’t know anything	Nyemenya naneke o
An idea struck him.	Susu aɖe va dze edzi nɛ.
There are so many facets to it.	Akpa geɖe ŋutɔ le eŋu.
Money is not a problem.	Ga menye kuxi o.
I told you what to do	Megblɔ nusi nàwɔ na wò
He was a strong man.	Enye ame sesẽ aɖe.
I never had that time	Ɣeyiɣi ma menɔ asinye kpɔ o
I need to talk to him.	Ele be maƒo nu kplii.
I want to know what they are doing	Medi be manya nusi wɔm wole
A long, long time ago.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I was definitely more relaxed	Meɖe dzi ɖi wu godoo
I can’t remember anything the teacher said	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nya aɖeke si nufiala la gblɔ dzi o
I can’t help you anymore.	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò azɔ o.
It’s much more personal.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ wu kura.
I knew I was having a tough day	Menya be ŋkeke sesẽ aɖe nɔ edzi yim
It doesn’t need any work at all	Mehiã dɔ aɖeke kura o
I haven’t seen you all day	Nyemekpɔ wò ŋkeke bliboa o
I can’t give up on you, not this soon	Nyemate ŋu ana ta le ŋuwò o, menye kaba alea o
That’s two threads.	Ema nye ka eve.
Everyone else felt it.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe se le eɖokui me nenema.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
I don’t know what he wants.	Nyemenya nusi dim wòle o.
It was only about two months ago.	Anɔ abe ɣleti eve koe nye ema va yi.
I wanted to make the ultimate man in my image	Medi be mawɔ ŋutsu mamlɛtɔ si le nye nɔnɔme nu
There will be no surprises.	Nu siwo awɔ nuku na ame aɖeke manɔ anyi o.
I had every reason to fight	Susu geɖe nɔ asinye si tae wòle be mawɔ avu ɖo
I don’t know what he’s trying to do.	Nyemenya nusi wòle agbagba dzem be yeawɔ o.
I can’t hear this stuff	Nyemate ŋu ase nu sia o
Men who have just entered.	Ŋutsu siwo ge ɖe eme teti koe nye ema.
Someone will find it.	Ame aɖe ake ɖe eŋu.
I hope you can do that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu awɔe nenema.
But it is not at all.	Gake menye nenema kura o.
But that’s not really what that thing is.	Gake menye nusi tututu nu ma nye o.
For all the good he has done	Le nyui siwo katã wòwɔ ta
Clearly, something is wrong with this situation.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ le nɔnɔme sia ŋu.
I can’t help it without that name	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu ŋkɔ ma manɔmee o
Do your part.	Wɔ wò akpa dzi.
I miss you so much	Mesusu wò ŋutɔ
I have nothing else to say today	Nya bubu aɖeke megale asinye magblɔ egbea o
I don’t know what’s wrong.	Nyemenya nusi gblẽ o.
I don’t know what to do about it	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso eŋu o
That would be sad for me.	Ema ate ɖe dzinye.
Perhaps there is too much.	Ðewohĩ nu geɖe le eme akpa.
We were very excited.	Dzi dzɔ mí ŋutɔ.
I just really liked this	Ðeko nya sia dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
I know a lot of things are true	Menya be nu geɖe nye nyateƒe
I just don’t know what to do with you.	Ðeko nyemenya nusi mawɔ kpli wò o.
But now.	Gake fifia.
Or some words like that.	Alo nya aɖewo abe ema ene.
I hope everything is going well for you	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nusianu le edzi yim nyuie na wò
He had never felt this way before.	Mese le eɖokui me alea kpɔ o.
There was so much he didn’t know yet.	Nu geɖe nɔ anyi siwo menya haɖe o.
OH! 	O!
You are here for you.	Èle afisia na wò.
I couldn’t find another one	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe bubu ŋu o
Every day, every night, every hour.	Gbe sia gbe, zã sia zã, kple gaƒoƒo ɖe sia ɖe.
I will actually do it.	Mawɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Who was asking him for money.	Ame si nɔ ga biam tso esi.
I can’t stand this house.	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi le aƒe sia me o.
They’re making food out of people.	Wole nuɖuɖu wɔm tso amewo me.
I didn’t expect it to be like that	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be anɔ nenema o
Check it out if you can.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu ne àte ŋui.
I couldn’t find anything	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe naneke ŋu o
For many reasons.	Le susu geɖe ta.
Nothing has ever worked.	Naneke mewɔ dɔ kpɔ o.
Talk to them.	Ƒo nu kpli wo.
I’m not happy with you	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe ŋuwò o
You are in control of your time again.	Èle wò ɣeyiɣi dzi ɖum ake.
Its kind of a problem for me.	Eƒe kuxi ƒomevi aɖee wònye nam.
His job was not easy for him.	Eƒe dɔa menɔ bɔbɔe nɛ o.
There is too much blood.	Ʋu sɔ gbɔ akpa.
I have things to talk about with you	Nuwo le asinye maƒo nu tso eŋu kpli wò
He never did anything.	Mewɔ naneke kpɔ o.
I couldn’t see anything	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ naneke o
I need some time to myself	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi aɖe na ɖokuinye
Which actually is the case.	Nusi le nyateƒe me la, ele nenema.
It worked out well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
Which is good for them.	Nusi nyo na wo.
I'll see you next week	Makpɔ wò le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me
I can’t do that	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema o
I know you are a good person	Menya be ame nyuie nènye
I have to find myself	Ele be madi ɖokuinye
I almost couldn’t get there	Nyemete ŋu ɖo afima o kloe
For about four years.	Anɔ abe ƒe ene ene.
I want a little happiness in my life too	Medi be dzidzɔ vi aɖe nanɔ nye agbe me hã
Maybe because it had an element of truth in it.	Ðewohĩ esi nyateƒe ƒe akpa aɖe nɔ eme tae.
As if it was only a matter of time.	Abe ɖe ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye ene.
It seems like a serious problem.	Edze abe kuxi sesẽ aɖee wònye ene.
I could have easily fought my way out of here	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔ avu bɔbɔe be mado le afisia hafi
I really believe that	Mexɔ nya ma dzi se ŋutɔŋutɔ
This is being worked on at this very moment.	Wole dɔ wɔm tso esia ŋu le ɣeyiɣi sia tututu me.
I’m not the type.	Menye nyee nye ƒomevi la o.
This worked better.	Esia wɔ dɔ nyuie wu.
Everything happened because of the fire.	Nusianu dzɔ le esi dzo la ta.
A strong desire to impress.	Didi vevie be yeawɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi.
I could know that much	Mete ŋu nya nu geɖe ma
I saw something positive about it	Mekpɔ nu nyui aɖe le eŋu
If you can, good for you.	Ne àte ŋui la, nyui na wò.
There were many reasons.	Susu geɖe nɔ eme.
Not when it mattered.	Menye esime wònɔ vevie o.
He didn’t know who he was.	Menya ame si wònye o.
These people know exactly what works for them.	Ame siawo nya nu si tututu wɔa dɔ na wo.
This is just the same thing.	Esia nye nu ɖeka ma ke ko.
I can’t get it out of my mind	Nyemate ŋu aɖee le nye susu me o
I can’t make you do anything	Nyemate ŋu ana nàwɔ naneke o
It couldn’t be worse.	Mate ŋu anye nu gbegblẽ wu ema o.
He didn’t greet us.	Medo gbe na mí o.
This should not surprise us.	Mele be esia nawɔ nuku na mí o.
The whole process was pretty easy up until this point.	Dɔ bliboa nɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ vaseɖe afisia.
He didn’t really see much.	Mekpɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
We have a big problem here.	Kuxi gã aɖe le mía ŋu le afisia.
I think we better be able to do them	Mesusu be anyo wu be míate ŋu awɔ wo
I just wanted to stay.	Ðeko medi be manɔ anyi.
I couldn’t see what he did	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi wòwɔ o
Not much opportunity for what you want.	Menye mɔnukpɔkpɔ geɖe na nusi nèdi o.
I get on well with it	Mewɔa nu nyuie kplii
I decided to let it all go	Meɖoe be maɖe asi le wo katã ŋu
That would be too expensive.	Ema axɔ asi akpa.
That might be a bit surprising.	Ema ate ŋu awɔ nuku vie.
I know what it’s like	Menya alesi wòle
I didn’t get to go because of time	Nyemekpɔ mɔ ayi le ɣeyiɣi ta o
We can do this.	Míate ŋu awɔ esia.
This process is now complete.	Dɔ sia wɔwɔ wu enu azɔ.
I don’t know how to help them.	Nyemenya ale si mawɔ akpe ɖe wo ŋu o.
Just me, my mind.	Nye ɖeka koe, nye susu.
I couldn’t understand why he would do such a crazy thing	Nyemete ŋu se nusita wòawɔ nusi me susu mele o alea gɔme o
I don’t know what to do here	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ le afisia o
It will also make my job easier.	Ana nye dɔ hã nanɔ bɔbɔe nam.
It wasn’t too late.	Metsi megbe akpa o.
Hours, in fact.	Le nyateƒe me la, gaƒoƒo geɖe.
I can never, ever do anything right	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke nyuie gbeɖe o, gbeɖe o
I will speak.	Maƒo nu.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
I never knew what it was	Nyemenya nusi wònye gbeɖe o
I just want to be in my own space	Ðeko medi be manɔ nye ŋutɔ nye teƒe
I really enjoyed the work	Dɔa do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
Each person is far apart.	Ame ɖesiaɖe didi tso wo nɔewo gbɔ.
I have nothing to say	Nya aɖeke mele asinye magblɔ o
He usually doesn’t do that sort of thing.	Zi geɖe la, mewɔa nu ma ƒomevi o.
You can still win.	Àte ŋu aɖu dzi kokoko.
I think he needs a place	Mesusu be ehiã teƒe aɖe
I’d love to just let it go	Adzɔ dzi nam be maɖe asi le eŋu ko
But many of them don’t.	Gake wo dometɔ geɖe ya mewɔa esia o.
There is no single job.	Dɔ ɖeka aɖeke mele eme o.
I felt so alone	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye ɖeka koe li ale gbegbe
I don’t want to do anything, really	Nyemedi be mawɔ naneke o, le nyateƒe me
I have already found someone	Meke ɖe ame aɖe ŋu xoxo
I can’t separate them anymore.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe wo dome azɔ o.
Which is I don’t want.	Nusi nye nyemedi o.
I can make you one of us	Mate ŋu awɔ wò mía dometɔ ɖeka
Not so much this time.	Menye nenema gbegbe zi sia o.
That rule has not been advanced.	Se ma medo ŋgɔ o.
But you can help yourself.	Gake àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I can’t be in a place where no one believes in me.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ teƒe si ame aɖeke mexɔ dzinye se o.
At least two of them.	Wo dometɔ eve ya teti.
I want to do well in my field	Medi be mawɔ dɔ nyuie le nye dɔa me
It’s not that simple.	Menye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
I had nothing to give up	Naneke menɔ asinye maɖe asi le o
I just know.	Ðeko menya.
I want to know everything	Medi be manya nusianu
That was a great night.	Zã gã aɖee nye ema.
For a month or more.	Ɣleti ɖeka alo esi wu nenema.
Somehow that doesn’t matter either.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, ema hã mehiã o.
I knew exactly where they were from that	Menya afisi tututu wole tso ema dzi
I can only tell you what the outcome will be.	Nusi ado tso eme koe mate ŋu agblɔ na mi.
If you like it, go ahead.	Ne edzɔ dzi na wò la, yi edzi.
Exactly what he was looking for.	Nusi tututu dim wònɔ.
I remember every moment	Meɖo ŋku ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe dzi
I knew it could happen	Menya be ate ŋu adzɔ
I am very angry now	Medo dziku ŋutɔ fifia
Think about that.	Bu nya ma ŋu kpɔ.
Once you look good.	Ne ènya dze nyuie ko.
Or someone else.	Alo ame bubu aɖe.
That’s what did it.	Emae wɔe.
I don’t know what to wear.	Nyemenya nusi mado ɖe edzi o.
There is no new idea.	Susu yeye aɖeke meli o.
Which is true, of course.	Nusi nye nyateƒe ya.
I was hoping you could live a normal life	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu anɔ agbe si sɔ
I know what you are	Menya nusi nènye
I think he had one or two children	Mesusu be vi ɖeka alo eve nɔ esi
I set it up just last month	Meɖoe le ɣleti si va yi me ko
I just couldn’t contain it all	Ðeko nyemete ŋu lé wo katã ɖe eme o
Same rule for everyone.	Se ɖeka na amesiame.
I can’t stand it anymore.	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi azɔ o.
I decided to share that with you	Meɖoe be magblɔ nya ma na mi
It is in itself.	Ele eme na eɖokui.
It surprised me more than anything	Ewɔ nuku nam wu nusianu
Something was seriously wrong, but he had no idea what had happened.	Nane gblẽ vevie, gake menya nusi dzɔ o.
This is still wrong.	Esia gakpɔtɔ nye nu gbegblẽ.
I quickly found it	Mewɔ kaba va ke ɖe eŋu
I couldn’t find one	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeka ŋu o
He won’t stay where he is for long.	Manɔ afisi wòle ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe o.
But not with the gun.	Gake menye kple tu la o.
I don’t know what day it is	Nyemenya ŋkeke si dzi wòle o
I put in some work last night	Metsɔ dɔ aɖewo de eme le zã si va yi me
Might as well tell him the truth	Ðewohĩ anyo be magblɔ nyateƒea nɛ hã
But the idea didn’t come true.	Gake susu meva eme o.
I have time to try.	Ɣeyiɣi le asinye mate kpɔ.
I should have done this years ago	Ðe wòle be mawɔ esia ƒe geɖe enye sia hafi
I expected something like this	Mekpɔ mɔ na nane si le abe esia ene
Be there for them.	Nɔ afima na wo.
Write everything down.	Ŋlɔ nusianu ɖi.
I am very interested in you too	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò hã ŋutɔ
I was the only one in the house	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ aƒea me
Lost without a name.	Nusi bu si ŋkɔ mele o.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
He also had a rope	Ka aɖe hã nɔ esi
But be careful.	Gake kpɔ nyuie.
I couldn’t wait to see them	Nyemete ŋu nɔ mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ wo o
I look forward to speaking with all of you	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be maƒo nu kple mi katã
How to make blood.	Ale si wòawɔ ʋu.
I just can’t be doing any work	Ðeko nyemate ŋu anɔ dɔ aɖeke wɔm o
I'm really fine	Mele nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ
I know, too easy again.	Menya, ele bɔbɔe akpa ake.
But it doesn’t matter now, one way or the other.	Gake mehiã fifia o, mɔ ɖeka alo bubu dzi.
I wonder what was in it	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae nɔ eme hã
I was looking forward to talking to you	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be maƒo nu kpli wò
This time he came alone.	Fifia ya eya ɖeka va.
This is almost verbatim.	Esia nye nya ɖe nya nu kloe.
Maybe I can work with this	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu awɔ dɔ kple esia
It was a summer.	Dzomeŋɔli aɖee nye ema.
That is the extreme.	Emae nye nusi gbɔ eme.
I could have done it too	Nye hã mate ŋu awɔe hafi
Please help me do it.	Taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye mawɔe.
This is absolutely true.	Esia nye nyateƒe kura.
I can handle this guy	Mete ŋu kpɔa ŋutsu sia gbɔ
But someone did that.	Gake ame aɖe wɔe nenema.
Water has damaged it	Tsi gblẽ nu le eme
I was worried about them.	Metsi dzi ɖe wo ŋu.
I had to get myself together	Ele be maƒo ɖokuinye nu ƒu
This is important for several reasons	Esia le vevie le susu geɖe ta
Now, or always.	Fifia, alo ɣesiaɣi.
I think it’s going to be great, great.	Mesusu be anye nu gã aɖe, nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
This will not work at all.	Esia mawɔ dɔ kura o.
This can be good and bad.	Esia ate ŋu anye nu nyui kple nu gbegblẽ.
We know where you are.	Míenya afisi nèle.
There is none of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
I need to talk to you.	Ehiã be maƒo nu na wò.
The search is over.	Didi la wu enu.
I know what it’s like.	Menya ale si wòle.
But he could not escape them.	Gake mete ŋu si le wo nu o.
That doesn’t matter now.	Ema mele vevie fifia o.
I am sure of one thing	Meka ɖe nu ɖeka dzi
I should know better	Ele be manya nyuie wu
His name is there.	Eƒe ŋkɔ le afima.
I wanted to see something	Medi be makpɔ nane
I think we have a lot going on.	Mesusu be nu geɖe le mía dzi yim.
I didn’t mind riding with him	Meɖe fu nam be mado sɔ kplii o
This was a big deal for him	Esia nye nu gã aɖe nɛ
People fell dead.	Amewo dze anyi ku.
I can explain it to him tomorrow	Mate ŋu aɖe eme nɛ etsɔ
The car is too good.	Ʋua nyo akpa.
I do this about twice a week	Mewɔa esia abe zi eve le kwasiɖa me ene
And something else.	Eye nu bubu aɖe hã.
I can’t imagine life without you	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ agbe le susu me wò manɔmee o
I don’t think that would be a good idea at all.	Nyemesusu be ema anye susu nyui aɖeke kura o.
It’s not a big deal for me.	Menye nu gã aɖeke nam o.
There is no chance for that.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke meli na ema o.
Maybe I was too quick	Ðewohĩ mewɔ kaba akpa
Find out more about it.	Kpɔ nu geɖe tso eŋu.
I remember this vividly	Meɖo ŋku esia dzi nyuie
I have only one issue.	Nya ɖeka koe le asinye.
But there was no one there.	Gake ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
He was a good guy.	Ame nyui aɖee wònye.
I thought it was the right thing to do	Mesusu be enye nu si sɔ be mawɔ
In the process, it worked to his advantage.	Le dɔa me la, ewɔ dɔ ɖe vi nɛ.
I will tell you the truth	Magblɔ nyateƒea na mi
It has never been like that.	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o.
But tonight it hit me.	Gake le zã sia me la, edze dzinye.
Thanks for my first post, man.	Akpe na wò ɖe nye nya gbãtɔ ta, ŋutsu.
I know a few of them	Menya wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo
I still don’t know who he is	Nyemenya amesi wònye haɖe o
I think it’s very important	Mesusu be ele vevie ŋutɔ
I couldn’t wait until morning.	Nyemete ŋu nɔ lalam vaseɖe ŋdi o.
I'm not sure it matters.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be ele vevie o.
I was making a lot of money.	Menɔ ga geɖe kpɔm.
I want to be on your side.	Medi be manɔ wò akpa dzi.
Last night was last night.	Zã si va yi nye zã si va yi.
And believe me, things happened.	Eye xɔ dzinye se, nuwo dzɔ.
He was a very nice guy.	Enye ame nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
It looks good.	Edze nyuie.
But here we can actually fight that.	Gake le afisia la, míate ŋu awɔ avu ma ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But he can	Gake ate ŋui .
There is a time and a place and a time for everything.	Ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe aɖe li eye ɣeyiɣi aɖe li na nusianu.
I wasn’t the only one up all night	Menye nye ɖeka koe nɔ ŋu zã bliboa o
I just saw this.	Ðeko mekpɔ esia.
Now I might have to.	Fifia ɖewohĩ ahiã be mawɔe.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There are two reasons for this.	Susu eve aɖewo tae esia dzɔ ɖo.
I stayed like that all day.	Menɔ anyi nenema ŋkeke bliboa.
In everything.	Le nusianu me.
Food is excellent.	Nuɖuɖu nyo ŋutɔ.
I don’t want to know anymore.	Nyemedi be manya azɔ o.
You can’t have everything.	Nusianu mate ŋu anɔ asiwò o.
No one asked for money.	Ame aɖeke mebia ga o.
I think there is one aspect.	Mesusu be akpa ɖeka aɖe li.
I decided to keep going	Meɖoe be mayi edzi
I’ve never been so happy either.	Nye hã nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ alea kpɔ o.
This seems strange to me, for the following reason.	Esia dze nam be ewɔ nuku nam, le susu si gbɔna ta.
Others who couldn’t.	Bubu siwo mete ŋui o.
There are probably four of them there now.	Anɔ eme be wo dometɔ ene ye le afima fifia.
It will help everyone	Akpe ɖe ame sia ame ŋu
I don’t know much more about me than you do	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso ŋunye wu wò o
He really didn’t have to do that	Le nyateƒe me la, mehiã be wòawɔ nu ma o
He gave it a name.	Etsɔ ŋkɔ nɛ.
This seemed to surprise them.	Edze abe esia wɔ nuku na wo ene.
I was hoping to find out more.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be mava nya nu geɖe wu ema.
A different one every night	Wo dometɔ ɖeka si to vovo zã sia zã
It’s a great idea.	Enye susu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
Do it today.	Wɔe egbea.
I put that in the back of my mind.	Metsɔ nya ma da ɖe nye susu ƒe megbe.
He didn’t let them.	Meɖe mɔ na wo o.
Nothing is good news.	Nya aɖeke menye nya nyui o.
Honestly, I felt like this guy wanted me in his womb	Le nyateƒe me la, mese le ɖokuinye me be ŋutsu sia di be manɔ yeƒe dɔ me
Or in real life.	Alo le agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ me.
We are currently addressing this issue.	Míele nya sia gbɔ kpɔm fifia.
You can’t get anywhere.	Màte ŋu aɖo afi aɖeke o.
I think it looks like a face	Mesusu be edze abe mo ene
But resist it.	Gake tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
A great song.	Ha gã aɖe.
But I don't know what to do.	Gake nyemenya nu si wòle be mawɔ o.
Maybe that’s enough.	Ðewohĩ ema sɔ gbɔ.
He doesn't deserve it	Medze nɛ menye eya o
I couldn’t break this down	Nyemete ŋu gblẽ nya sia me o
But his face showed nothing.	Gake eƒe mo meɖe naneke fia o.
I don’t know what’s in it.	Nyemenya nusi le eme o.
I will find them at home.	Makpɔ wo le aƒeme.
Part of me is there, right here	Nye akpa aɖe le afima, le afisia tututu
He wasn’t there yet.	Menɔ afima haɖe o.
I couldn’t think of that.	Nyemete ŋu bu nya ma ŋu kpɔ o.
I can’t tell him about it	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nu tso eŋu nɛ o
I just need some time to myself for a bit	Ðeko mehiã ɣeyiɣi aɖe na ɖokuinye vie
A lively night if there ever was one	Zã si me agbe le nenye be ɖeka nɔ anyi kpɔ
This time there was a quality in her voice that she had never heard before.	Fifia ya nɔnɔme aɖe si mese kpɔ o nɔ eƒe gbe me.
I was very pleased with it	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
I tried to make his heart	Medze agbagba be mawɔ eƒe dzi
It used to be gone in a day or two.	Tsã la, eƒe nu yi le ŋkeke ɖeka alo eve me.
I asked for a lot of things	Mebia nu geɖe
There is no one like him.	Ame aɖeke meli si le abe eya ene o.
I’m not really sure if that’s a lot or a little.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi ŋutɔŋutɔ nenye be ema sɔ gbɔ alo vi aɖe o.
My hand was small in his.	Nye asi nɔ sue le eƒe asi me.
I made myself a cocktail.	Mewɔ aha sesẽ aɖe na ɖokuinye.
I don’t know what kind of situation this is	Nyemenya nɔnɔme si ƒomevi nye esia o
I can’t escape it	Nyemate ŋu asi le eŋu o
Now we are.	Fifia míenye.
I can’t take my eyes off her	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nye ŋku ɖa le eŋu o
He didn’t know what was in it.	Menya nusi le eme o.
No man has taken any steps which might lead that party.	Ŋutsu aɖeke meɖe afɔ aɖeke si ate ŋu axɔ ŋgɔ na akpa ma o.
This went on all night.	Esia yi edzi zã bliboa katã.
Now it can do the same for you!.	Fifia ate ŋu awɔ nenema ke na wò!.
I need to talk to you about it	Ehiã be maƒo nu tso eŋu na wò
I had to let go of my dog	Ele nam be maɖe asi le nye avu ŋu
I don’t know about it.	Menye nyee menya o.
I hope he does that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔe nenema.
You can let it go.	Àte ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu.
Or some other way.	Alo mɔ bubu aɖe dzi.
I like my job, actually	Nye dɔa dzɔa dzi nam, le nyateƒe me
In this day and age, things have changed.	Le ŋkeke kple ɣeyiɣi sia me la, nuwo trɔ.
But, you never know.	Gake, mènya gbeɖe o.
We’re on it.	Míele edzi.
He handed me a gun.	Etsɔ tu aɖe nam.
That’s just his way.	Eƒe mɔ koe nye ema.
He didn’t know who he was or where he was.	Menya amesi wònye alo afisi wòle o.
This is not a good thing to do.	Esia menye nu nyui si wòle be woawɔ o.
I don’t have any money.	Ga aɖeke mele asinye o.
This is not the case at all.	Esia mele alea kura o.
No one knows anyone.	Ame aɖeke menya ame aɖeke o.
I know you won’t have that	Menya be ema manɔ asiwò o
Yet, they have certain qualities.	Ke hã nɔnɔme aɖewo le wo si.
It was the first time he had done so.	Enye zi gbãtɔ si wòwɔ nenema.
But really, it was less than that.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, ɖe wòle sue wu nenema.
I couldn’t figure out exactly what it was	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi tututu wònye o
We’re just fine.	Ðeko míele nyuie.
I couldn’t be happier with them	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe wo ŋu wu ema o
I’m interested in you.	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò.
I asked about the project	Mebia nya ku ɖe dɔa ŋu
I just felt so nervous.	Ðeko mese le ɖokuinye me be metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ.
I wonder what he did there	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae wòwɔ le afima hã
And every morning.	Eye ŋdi sia ŋdi.
I've done that much with him	Mewɔe nenema gbegbe kplii kpɔ
I understand your home is nearby	Mese egɔme be wò aƒe te ɖe afima ŋu
There is nothing.	Naneke meli o.
I already told you that.	Megblɔ nya ma na mi xoxo.
This is for the following reasons.	Esia le alea le susu siwo gbɔna ta.
Any help would be great.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe anyo ŋutɔ.
Someone can just do it.	Ame aɖe ate ŋu awɔe ko.
I also know what I will be wearing tonight	Menya nusi mado le zã sia me hã
Our lives are too short.	Míaƒe agbe le kpuie akpa.
A lot of things.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
I had to see everything, to know what really happened	Ele be makpɔ nusianu, be manya nusi tututu dzɔ
There is bad rejection, and there is good rejection.	Gbegbe gbegblẽ li, eye gbegbe nyui hã li.
That’s not what they want.	Menye emae nye nusi dim wole o.
I need air, just a little air	Mehiã ya, ya vi aɖe ko
Maybe there’s a time and place for everything.	Ðewohĩ ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe aɖe anɔ anyi na nusianu.
I knew he would be pleased	Menya be adzɔ dzi nɛ
Some really bad things happened last week.	Nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖewo dzɔ le kwasiɖa si va yi me.
I know where we are.	Menya afisi míele.
We are doing the opposite.	Míele nusi to vovo na ema wɔm.
He didn’t really care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Small and tired.	Sue eye ɖeɖi te eŋu.
I couldn’t stand it at all	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te sesĩe kura o
I just tried and it worked	Ðeko medze agbagba eye wòwɔ dɔ
I should have been there, stop that guy	Ðe wòle be manɔ afima hafi, tɔ te ŋutsu ma
I felt like a person	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ame ene
A masculine figure appeared	Ŋutsu ƒe nɔnɔme aɖe dze
And everyone is a part of it.	Eye amesiame nye eƒe akpa aɖe.
But it is a good attitude.	Gake nɔnɔme nyuie wònye.
I can’t live without it	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe ema manɔmee o
You just can’t do it.	Ðeko màte ŋu awɔe o.
If anyone knows.	Ne ame aɖe nya.
It can stand on its own.	Ate ŋu anɔ te ɖe eɖokui si.
Like maybe one or two.	Abe ɖewohĩ ɖeka alo eve ene.
It’s a lot, but it’s necessary.	Enye nu geɖe, gake ehiã.
Do the same thing.	Wɔ nenema ke.
He was just the same person.	Eya hã nye ame ma ke ko.
It could be a waste of your time and money.	Ate ŋu anye wò ɣeyiɣi kple ga gbegblẽ.
And, that’s a whole different thing.	Eye, ema nye nu si to vovo kura.
I want to know everything about them	Medi be manya nusianu tso wo ŋu
Hate these people.	Fu ame siawo.
I tell you what this is	Megblɔ nusi esia nye na mi
I am convinced of it now	Meka ɖe edzi fifia
I was wondering what kept you going	Menɔ ɖokuinye biam be nukae lé wò ɖe te hã
I really want to be like him in everything	Medi vevie be manɔ abe eya ene le nusianu me
I have seen so much	Mekpɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ
Some people are smarter than me.	Ame aɖewo dze aɖaŋu wu nye.
I just wanted to do everything	Ðeko medi be mawɔ nusianu
There will be no help there.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke manɔ afima o.
But I can eat them	Gake mate ŋu aɖu wo
I was glad to see him too	Edzɔ dzi nam be mekpɔ eya hã
It can be deadly in that.	Ate ŋu awu ame le ema me.
I had nothing for him	Naneke menɔ asinye nɛ o
I understood every word so much	Mese nya ɖesiaɖe gɔme ale gbegbe
Great stuff for little money.	Nu gã aɖe le ga sue aɖe ko ta.
It could be really good.	Ate ŋu anyo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is not one of them	Esia menye wo dometɔ ɖeka o
What we are doing now is very different.	Nusi wɔm míele fifia la to vovo kura.
I don’t have to do anything, you did it all	Mehiã be mawɔ naneke o, wòe wɔ wo katã
He had a big heart.	Dzi gã aɖe nɔ esi.
In addition to some books.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe agbalẽ aɖewo ŋu.
Or formerly.	Alo tsã.
I'm nervous now, that's all.	Metsi dzodzodzoe fifia, ema koe nye ema.
After all, I care about someone other than myself.	Le nyateƒe me la, metsɔ ɖe le eme na ame bubu si menye nye ŋutɔ o.
With your help, maybe we can go further.	To wò kpekpeɖeŋu me la, ɖewohĩ míate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu ema.
But he would have been very focused.	Gake anye ne eƒe susu nanɔ eŋu ŋutɔ.
That person is not me.	Ame ma menye nyee o.
I can see them.	Mete ŋu kpɔa wo.
He can do that.	Ate ŋu awɔ ema.
I am feeling very happy today	Mele dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔ egbea
That's it.	Ema li.
Nothing was more important than my job.	Naneke menɔ vevie wu nye dɔa o.
I am watching them now.	Mele wo kpɔm fifia.
For some reason, he didn’t seem to care.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, edze abe metsɔ ɖeke le eme o ene.
I don’t know about all of them at all	Nyemenya nu tso wo katã ŋu kura o
I don’t know who else to call	Nyemenya ame bubu si maƒo ka na o
Start right close to home.	Dze egɔme tso aƒe gbɔ tututu.
I have to do the same	Ele be nye hã mawɔ nenema ke
Anything is possible, kid.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ, ɖevi.
Please reach out to us.	Taflatse do asi ɖe mía gbɔ.
I don’t want you to have any of it	Nyemedi be eƒe akpa aɖeke nanɔ asiwò o
Right here and now.	Le afisia tututu kple fifia.
My, not so good.	Nye, menye nyuie nenema gbegbe o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Do my job.	Wɔ nye dɔ.
I have done this before	Mewɔ esia do ŋgɔ
This is a new life.	Esia nye agbe yeye aɖe.
This is not expensive.	Esia mexɔ asi o.
Much more than before.	Nu geɖe wu tsã.
This was able to be done.	Esia te ŋu wɔ.
That is the real situation in the present case.	Emae nye nɔnɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ si le nya si me míele fifia me.
How amazing this is to me.	Aleke gbegbe esia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
That could take years.	Ema ate ŋu axɔ ƒe geɖe.
What we are running now is very fast.	Nusi míele du dzi fifia la le du dzi ŋutɔ.
For one thing, he had no money.	Nu ɖekae nye be ga menɔ esi o.
It’s his place, like school.	Enye eƒe teƒe, abe suku ene.
I have been here many times.	Meva afisia zi geɖe.
I’m wearing a dress	Medo awu aɖe
We have a lot of books.	Agbalẽ geɖe le mía si.
No one had ever done that before.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ nu ma kpɔ o.
Actually, for two reasons.	Le nyateƒe me la, susu eve aɖewo tae.
I think that happened here	Mesusu be nu ma dzɔ le afisia
She is expecting a child.	Ele mɔ kpɔm na ɖevi aɖe.
Each of them is enough.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe sɔ gbɔ.
But there wasn’t much in the room to help.	Gake nu geɖe menɔ xɔa me si akpe ɖe eŋu o.
Find your own way.	Di wò ŋutɔ wò mɔ.
So much was lost in the background.	Ale gbegbe be nu geɖe bu ɖe megbe.
For the past week I have been a loser	Kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia si menye ame aɖe si bu
This happened more than once.	Esia dzɔ wu zi ɖeka.
I thought it was a bad thing.	Mesusu be enye nu gbegblẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
I don’t have to be here for that process	Mehiã be manɔ afisia na ɖoɖo ma o
He was kind of surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ le mɔ aɖe nu.
I also came at the same time as him	Meva hã le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me abe eya ene
It doesn’t get easier than this.	Meva nɔa bɔbɔe wu esia o.
I question you personally, great	Mebiaa gbe wò ŋutɔ, gã
I don’t have any children	Vi aɖeke mele asinye o
I felt nothing this time	Nyemese naneke le ɖokuinye me zi sia o
I wish there was another way, but there wasn’t	Ne ɖe mɔ bubu aɖe nɔ anyi hafi, gake menɔ anyi o
It’s too obvious.	Edze ƒã akpa.
In this city, too.	Le du sia hã me.
I have to see your face though	Ele nam be makpɔ wò mo ke hã
I hope you can as well	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋui abe alesi wòle ene
There is a mistake there.	Vodada aɖe le afima.
We always know exactly what’s going on.	Míenya nusi tututu le edzi yim ɣesiaɣi.
I needed something to do	Mehiã nane si mawɔ
A few people stayed behind	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo hã tsi megbe
I can see how that might work	Mete ŋu kpɔa alesi ema ate ŋu awɔe
We’re going to find out what happened to him.	Míele nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi la di ge.
And there are people alive who would have died.	Eye ame aɖewo hã le agbe siwo anye ne ku hafi.
I remember his name now	Meɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi fifia
I worked with them.	Mewɔ dɔ kpli wo.
But this doesn’t have to be easy.	Gake mehiã be esia nanɔ bɔbɔe o.
Not after all these years.	Menye le ƒe siawo katã megbe o.
He is fighting without any real reason.	Ele avu wɔm kple susu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke manɔmee.
A great deal, actually	Nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me
His death came at this time.	Eƒe ku va le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
You can’t talk about this your way.	Màte ŋu aƒo nu tso esia ŋu le wò mɔ nu o.
There were two.	Eve nɔ anyi.
Start a new life.	Dze agbe yeye gɔme.
I don’t know what to do about it	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso eŋu o
We can help with it.	Míate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu.
And this didn’t please him.	Eye esia medze eŋu o.
A good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe.
Talk to them.	Ƒo nu kpli wo.
People are ready for it now.	Amewo le klalo na esia fifia.
Unlike me.	To vovo na nye.
That’s his whole strategy.	Emae nye eƒe aɖaŋu bliboa.
I just didn’t know what to do	Ðeko nyemenya nusi mawɔ o
It doesn’t matter that there might be an issue.	Mehiã be ɖewohĩ nya aɖe nanɔ anyi o.
I have never seen anyone so interested in me	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke si tsɔ ɖe le eme nam nenema gbegbe kpɔ o
I can’t let go of this project	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le dɔ sia ŋu o
I certainly did.	Mewɔe godoo.
I hope this is good for you	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia nyo na mi
It’s a little weird, but not bad	Ewɔ nuku vie, gake menye nu gbegblẽ o
I just knew it was true	Ðeko menya be enye nyateƒe
I always have someone with me.	Ame aɖe nɔa ŋunye ɣesiaɣi.
He has a lot to do.	Nu geɖe wòle be wòawɔ.

Now look where he is.	Azɔ kpɔ afisi wòle ɖa.
Thank you very much again.	Akpe geɖe na mi ake.
I couldn’t find anything.	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe naneke ŋu o.

I couldn’t change any of them	Nyemete ŋu trɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o

They all seem to be fine.	Edze abe wo katã wole nyuie ene.

Just some comments on cheap parts.	Nya aɖewo ko siwo ku ɖe akpa siwo mexɔ asi o ŋu.
I didn’t see anything.	Nyemekpɔ nya aɖeke o.
I just remember this project	Ðeko meɖo ŋku dɔ sia dzi
Let me know where you are.	Na manya afi si nèle.
Everyone borrowed money from it	Amesiame do ga le eme
I'll come looking for you.	Mava di wò.
I couldn’t put this down	Nyemete ŋu tsɔ esia da ɖi o
I'm doing a lot of that right now.	Mele nu geɖe wɔm le ema ŋu fifia.
I had this idea here and now	Susu sia nɔ asinye le afisia kple fifia
He couldn't seem to pay attention.	Edze abe mete ŋu lé to ɖe eŋu o ene.
Perhaps you too.	Ðewohĩ wò hã.
I'm sure that will work	Meka ɖe edzi be ema awɔ dɔ
I have an afternoon job	Ŋdɔ me dɔ aɖe le asinye
It's running though.	Ele du dzi gake.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
I just didn’t really know what he was doing	Ðeko nyemenya nusi tututu wɔm wònɔ o
I guess it doesn’t really matter anymore though	Mesusu be megale vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ o ke hã
Everything was against me.	Nusianu tsi tre ɖe ŋunye.
Turn to the seeds.	Trɔ ka si si la.
I tried to speak but couldn't	Medze agbagba be maƒo nu gake nyemete ŋui o
I was sweating and so tired	Fifia xɔ dzinye eye ɖeɖi te ŋunye ale gbegbe
And that seemed to help a lot.	Eye edze abe ema kpe ɖe ame ŋu ŋutɔ ene.
Which is probably a good thing.	Nusi anya nye nu nyui aɖe.
It started off well.	Edze egɔme nyuie.
I can’t understand his reasoning	Nyemate ŋu ase eƒe susu gɔme o
That maybe this means a lot to someone.	Be ɖewohĩ esia fia nu geɖe na ame aɖe.
I can never get enough	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ gbeɖe o
And how they will be treated.	Eye alesi woawɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋui.

I had to do something quickly	Ele be mawɔ nane kaba
Just so we can get rid of them.	Be míate ŋu aɖe wo ɖa ko.
Not that there really is a situation.	Menye ɖe nɔnɔme aɖe li ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I shouldn’t have hit you	Mele be maƒo wò hafi o

But that didn’t work.	Gake ema medze edzi o.

No voice emerged either.	Gbe aɖeke hã medo mo ɖa o.
You can’t do better than that.	Màte ŋu awɔ nu si nyo wu ema o.

I barely felt it this time.	Ƒã hafi mese le ɖokuinye me zi sia.
I told myself it was nothing	Megblɔ na ɖokuinye be menye naneke o
His people needed food that could travel with them.	Eƒe amewo hiã nuɖuɖu si ate ŋu azɔ mɔ kpli wo.
You’re not ready.	Wò mèle klalo o.

Only you can hear it.	Wò ɖeka koe ate ŋu ase.

This process takes years.	Dɔ sia wɔwɔ xɔa ƒe geɖe.

He will command her.	Aɖe gbe nɛ.
I could do it with your help, of course	Mate ŋu awɔe kple wò kpekpeɖeŋu, le nyateƒe me
I knew we were asking for trouble	Menya be míele kuxi biam
I'm not sure why that is.	Nyemeka ɖe nusita wòle nenema dzi o.
He didn’t show up.	Meɖe eɖokui fia o.

It's going well.	Ele edzi yim nyuie.
I'll tell you what.	Magblɔ nusi na wò.
It wasn’t easy either.	Menɔ bɔbɔe hã o.
We will fight where we are now.	Míawɔ avu le afisi míele fifia.
Anything outside of this context is denial.	Nusianu si mele nya sia me o la nye gbegbe.
I wasn't sure how he would treat me.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi wòawɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋunye dzi o.
Or any kind of reasonable rule.	Alo se ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe si me susu le.
I used to know something was wrong	Menya tsã be nane gblẽ

Probably none of them are.	Anɔ eme be wo dometɔ aɖeke mele nenema o.
A year or two later, the same.	Le ƒe ɖeka alo eve megbe la, nenema ke.

He was only one child	Vi ɖeka koe wònye
He had a reason.	Susu nɔ esi.
I can’t let go of the little guy easily	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le ŋutsu sue la ŋu bɔbɔe o
I asked you for something.	Mebia nu na wò.

No one has ever done anything wrong.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke kpɔ o.

How many people died? 	Ame nenie ku?
But he wasn’t satisfied at all.	Gake eƒe dzi medze eme kura o.
He’s sick.	Edze dɔ.

Which is very good.	Nusi nyo ŋutɔ.

Otherwise it is in new condition.	Ne menye nenema o la, ele nɔnɔme yeye me.
He compared them to his own.	Etsɔ wo sɔ kple eya ŋutɔ tɔ.

I tried to talk to him, but he wasn’t ready.	Medze agbagba be maƒo nu kplii, gake mele klalo o.

But the reality is different.	Gake nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ya to vovo.

This is impossible to happen.	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I started this.	Medze esia gɔme.
It didn’t help.	Meɖe vi aɖeke o.
I must have money.	Ele be ga nanɔ asinye.
That requires space.	Ema bia teƒe.
I don’t think it worked	Mesusu be mewɔ dɔ o
This seems likely.	Edze abe esia anya wɔ ene.
I just couldn’t do it yet	Ðeko nyemete ŋu wɔe haɖe o
I need to see you, one, as soon as possible	Ele be makpɔ wò, ɖeka, kaba ale si mate ŋui
He had his time.	Eƒe ɣeyiɣi nɔ esi.
No one knows where he is.	Ame aɖeke menya afi si wòle o.
There is always something going on	Nane nɔa edzi yim ɣesiaɣi
There never was much time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
This is going to happen.	Esia le edzi yim.
That may not be helpful.	Ðewohĩ ema maɖe vi o.
I want to work with him	Medi be mawɔ dɔ kplii
Someone does this.	Ame aɖe wɔa esia.
I couldn’t quite take it all in	Nyemete ŋu xɔ wo katã ɖe eme tututu o
I know his name rings a bell somewhere	Menya be eƒe ŋkɔ ɖi gaƒoƒo aɖe le afi aɖe
I had no better idea	Susu aɖeke menɔ asinye si nyo wu ema o
I believe in that.	Mexɔ ema dzi se.
That’s our whole team.	Emae nye míaƒe ha bliboa.
He couldn't let her, couldn't let her.	Mete ŋu ɖe mɔ nɛ o, mete ŋu ɖe mɔ nɛ o.
He seemed to be in a bad mood.	Edze abe eƒe lãme gblẽ ene.
Food is very expensive.	Nuɖuɖu xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
Other than that, he seems to be doing well.	Ne menye nenema o la, edze abe ele edzi dzem nyuie ene.
I have never seen anything better.	Nyemekpɔ nusi nyo wu esia kpɔ o.
I made four of them this morning.	Mewɔ wo dometɔ ene ŋdi sia.
Many people came to us.	Ame geɖe va mía gbɔ.
He didn’t let go of her hand.	Meɖe asi le eƒe asi ŋu o.
Would kill for that.	Awu ame ɖe ema ta.
He couldn't now anyway.	Mete ŋui fifia le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I had expressed my opinion	Megblɔ nye susu tsã
There is something wrong with this.	Nane gblẽ le esia ŋu.
But it is necessary.	Gake ehiã.
Kind of the same year.	Ƒe ma ke ƒomevi.
I doubt if he’ll remember me	Meke ɖi nenye be aɖo ŋku dzinye
The car opens for a day or two.	Ʋua ʋua ŋkeke ɖeka alo eve.
I wouldn’t have been able to handle that	Anye ne nyemate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ o
I can’t get you out of my mind	Nyemate ŋu aɖe wò ɖa le nye susu me o
It is also very simple.	Ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ hã.
I rode through it once	Medo sɔ to eme zi ɖeka
If you have time, you can go there.	Ne ɣeyiɣi le asiwò la, àte ŋu ayi afima.
I used to want to rush that.	Tsã la, medi be mawɔ kaba awɔ nya ma.
It just isn’t.	Ðeko mele nenema o.
I really hope you can figure this out	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be àte ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ
I can’t get it out of my head	Nyemate ŋu aɖee le ta me o
Part of him enjoyed it	Eƒe akpa aɖe do dzidzɔ nɛ
The beer is fresher.	Bia la le yeye wu.
I will work through it.	Mawɔ dɔ to eme.
A hand touched my head	Asi aɖe ka nye ta
That was never sure.	Ema meka ɖe edzi gbeɖe o.
I have to go to them.	Nyee wòle be mayi wo gbɔ.
I'm sure you don't want me to	Meka ɖe edzi be mèdi be mawɔe o
There will be days when he can do no wrong.	Ŋkeke aɖewo ava esime mate ŋu awɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o.
Not that one.	Menye ɖeka ma o.
They have no children	Vi aɖeke mele wo si o
He doesn’t do that now.	Mewɔa nu ma fifia o.
It was very impressive	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
This is appropriate.	Esia sɔ.
I hope this guy knows what he is doing	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ŋutsu sia nya nusi wɔm wòle
I want to do something about that.	Medi be mawɔ nane tso ema ŋu.
Still, it seems important.	Ke hã, edze abe ele vevie ene.
In these things.	Le nu siawo me.
I think he desperately needs money	Mesusu be ehiã ga vevie
Maybe it was too soon.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ kaba akpa.
I wouldn’t mind working in a song	Maɖe fu nam be mawɔ dɔ le ha aɖe me o
I’ve done it for him before	Mewɔe nɛ kpɔ
More than more money.	Nu geɖe wu ga geɖe wu.
There is no obvious error.	Vodada aɖeke meli si dze ƒã o.
I just didn’t want to go there with him	Ðeko nyemedi be mayi afima kplii o
I was a little surprised	Ewɔ nuku nam vie
I doubt that it is.	Meke ɖi be ele nenema.
I should have known something was wrong	Ðe wòle be manya be nane gblẽ hafi
Something that was almost there, almost ready, almost .	Nane si nɔ afima kloe, si le klalo kloe, kloe .
I know a man who knows a man	Menya ŋutsu aɖe si nya ŋutsu aɖe
The same person.	Ame ma ke.
I couldn’t hold her back	Nyemete ŋu lé eɖokui ɖe te o
It’s not like that.	Menye nenema o.
I need something deeper	Mehiã nane si de to wu
Each with its own character.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe kple eƒe nɔnɔme.
It’s a pretty big deal.	Enye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
That will never go away.	Ema nu ayi gbeɖe o.
He was also alone.	Eya ɖeka hã nɔ anyi.
All in good to very good condition.	Wo katã wole nɔnɔme nyui me va ɖo nɔnɔme nyui ŋutɔ me.
I plan to call you soon	Meɖoe be maƒo ka na wò kaba
I tried my best to explain them	Medze agbagba ɖesiaɖe be maɖe nu me tso wo ŋu
I knew he was going to succeed	Menya be ele edzi dze ge
Now there is something else.	Fifia nu bubu aɖe hã li.
Is.	Enye.
He would never have come close.	Anye ne mate ɖe eŋu gbeɖe o.
A little more heart.	Eƒe dzi geɖe wu vie.
We all had a chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ nɔ mía katã si.
I went out into the room	Medo go yi xɔa me
I'm not really sure what else to do with them.	Nyemeka ɖe nu bubu si mawɔ ɖe wo ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ dzi o.
I have a borrowed sword but little skill with it	Yi si medo le asinye gake aɖaŋu boo aɖeke mele asinye le eŋu o
That’s too much.	Ema sɔ gbɔ akpa.
I couldn’t escape it	Nyemete ŋu si le eme o
I just couldn’t sit still.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu nɔ anyi ɖe teƒe ɖeka o.
We’re not ready, but we have a few months.	Míele klalo o, gake ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo le mía si.
This got a lot of notoriety.	Esia xɔ ŋkɔ geɖe.
What is there, now? 	Nukae li, fifia?
. . . .	.
It is an impressive arrangement.	Enye ɖoɖo si wɔa dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
On his part, he said.	Le eƒe akpa dzi.
Hopefully it will be a great year.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be anye ƒe gã aɖe.
But I do need them	Gake nye ya mehiã wo nyateƒe
I really couldn’t do anything.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
I must have pissed him off, somehow	Anɔ eme be medo dziku nɛ, le mɔ aɖe nu
I just could never do it, that’s all	Ðeko nyemete ŋu wɔe gbeɖe o, ema koe nye ema
Or anyone else.	Alo ame bubu ɖesiaɖe.
It looks a little better.	Edze nyuie vie.
I wonder if this is not death in itself	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe esia menye ku le eɖokui si o hã
Now he has an idea.	Fifia susu aɖe le esi.
But it didn’t last long.	Gake menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o.
I apologize for that.	Meɖe kuku ɖe ema ta.
I couldn't understand why he treated her that way	Nyemete ŋu se nusita wòwɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu nenema gɔme o
There was another man	Ŋutsu bubu aɖe nɔ anyi kpɔ
He is not there now.	Mele afima fifia o.
I didn’t know what to expect	Nyemenya nusi makpɔ mɔ na o
And I am like that.	Eye nye nenema.
I just heard last night	Ðeko mese le zã si va yi me
I can’t feel anything	Nyemate ŋu ase naneke le ɖokuinye me o
Nice to meet you	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò
Again.	Ake.
Just focus on one.	Ðeko wò susu nanɔ ɖeka ŋu.
Until a male year.	Vaseɖe esime ŋutsu ƒe ɖeka.
This very way.	Mɔ sia tututu dzi.
I will need to get closer	Ahiã be mate ɖe eŋu wu
Blood in the back of my own head.	Ʋu le nye ŋutɔ nye ta megbe.
It’s a crazy idea.	Enye susu si me susu mele o.
I had a lot to explain to him	Nu geɖe nɔ asinye maɖe eme nɛ
There is nothing better than that.	Naneke meli si nyo wu ema o.
I can see more, differently than before	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu geɖe wu, le mɔ bubu nu wu tsã
Not a bad job like some.	Menye dɔ gbegblẽ abe ame aɖewo ene o.
The other one is beautiful.	Bubu la nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
That doesn’t explain what you’re doing here.	Ema meɖe nusi wɔm nèle le afisia me o.
Put your hand on your heart.	Da wò asi ɖe wò dzi dzi.
Anything else is possible.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe ate ŋu adzɔ.
I almost reached the top	Meɖo ta dzi kloe
In fact, I'm beginning to think he's actually quite thin.	Le nyateƒe me la, mele egɔme dzem be le nyateƒe me la, eƒe lãme le sue ŋutɔ.
It’s always a surprise.	Enye nusi awɔ nuku na ame ɣesiaɣi.
You can find everything you are looking for here.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusianu si dim nèle le afisia.
I wish I could have been there more for her	Anye ne mate ŋu anɔ afima geɖe wu nɛ hafi
It had seemed so simple.	Edze abe ɖe wòle bɔbɔe ŋutɔ ene tsã.
I still miss my hair some days.	Nye ɖa gakpɔtɔ le susu me nam ŋkeke aɖewo.
He will always stand by me	Manɔ te ɖe ŋunye ɣesiaɣi
I have a lot of my own between all of us	Nye ŋutɔ tɔ geɖe le asinye le mía katã dome
I do know what happened	Menya nusi dzɔ ya
I know we can do it	Menya be míate ŋu awɔe
He did this for me, too, in the first year.	Ewɔ esia nam hã, le ƒe gbãtɔ me.
The way things used to be.	Ale si nuwo nɔ tsã.
I could have done something	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔ nane hafi
I want to deal with that one too.	Medi be mawɔ nu kple ɖeka ma hã.
I hope it can help us	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ate ŋu akpe ɖe mía ŋu
I don’t want any of them	Nyemedi wo dometɔ aɖeke o
Nothing fit us right.	Naneke medze na mí nyuie o.
This is a very different strategy.	Esia nye aɖaŋu si to vovo kura.
I couldn’t control myself	Nyemete ŋu ɖu ɖokuinye dzi o
I have never felt this way before.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me alea kpɔ o.
Please share if you like this!!!.	Taflatse ma ne esia dze ŋuwò!!!.

But our work remains clear.	Gake míaƒe dɔa gakpɔtɔ me kɔ.
Come home, kid.	Va aƒea me, ɖevi.
What works for me may not work for you.	Ðewohĩ nu si wɔa dɔ nam la mawɔ dɔ na wò o.

I just wanted to have a little fun	Ðeko medi be makpɔ dzidzɔ vie
It’s not you.	Menye wòe o.
I have never liked this room	Xɔ sia medze ŋunye kpɔ o
His own people too.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe amewo hã.
I just wasn’t happy	Ðeko nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o
And it’s so simple.	Eye wòle bɔbɔe ale gbegbe.
People will make money.	Amewo akpɔ ga.
I said I apologized so many times.	Megblɔ be meɖe kuku zi geɖe ale gbegbe.
I stayed in all night	Menɔ eme zã bliboa katã
It will probably help you.	Anɔ eme be akpe ɖe ŋuwò.

Two minds are two tongues	Susu eve nye aɖe eve

Not really there.	Menye afima ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
It can never be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
There are many problems with it.	Kuxi geɖe le eŋu.
I just want to know how it is	Ðeko medi be manya alesi wòle

I need to know more.	Ele be manya nu geɖe wu.
You have a big part to play in this process.	Wò ŋutɔ wò akpa gã aɖe le dɔ sia wɔwɔ me.
There was no one here.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afisia o.
I wanted something new	Medi nu yeye aɖe
He had everything.	Nusianu nɔ esi.

This is one for him.	Esia nye ɖeka nɛ.
I want to know what they are doing	Medi be manya nusi wɔm wole
Time is not an issue.	Ɣeyiɣi menye nya o.
I went out through it	Medo go to eŋu
He didn't know what he was expecting.	Menya nusi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na o.
I just want something done	Ðeko medi be woawɔ nane
I think he’s focused on us now	Mesusu be eƒe susu le mía ŋu fifia
But there was more to it than that.	Gake nu geɖe nɔ eme wu esia.
For my child.	Na nye ɖevi.
I felt alone in that moment	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye ɖeka koe le ɣeyiɣi ma me
Which means one of two things.	Nusi fia nu eve dometɔ ɖeka.
In fact, I was very busy	Le nyateƒe me la, vovo menɔ ŋunye kura o
Tell us what you think.	Gblɔ nusi nèsusu.
There is still time.	Ɣeyiɣi gakpɔtɔ li.
You could have done better!.	Àte ŋu awɔe nyuie wu hafi!.
He couldn’t seem to find his voice.	Edze abe mete ŋu ke ɖe eƒe gbe ŋu o ene.
You are not in a position.	Mèle nɔnɔme aɖeke me o.
I had to know what was going on	Ele be manya nu si nɔ edzi yim
And this is just a rock.	Eye kpe aɖe koe esia nye.
He never did one for me.	Mewɔ ɖeka nam kpɔ o.
I really wanted to let go	Medi vevie be maɖe asi le eŋu
Running away from everything.	Esi le nusianu nu.
There will be a night.	Zã aɖe ava.
I have to approach you tonight	Ele be mate ɖe ŋuwò le zã sia me
But this doesn’t have to be the case for you.	Gake mehiã be esia nanɔ alea na wò o.
This is totally impossible	Esia mate ŋu adzɔ kura o
I have never, ever, seen anything so interesting	Nyemekpɔ naneke si doa dzidzɔ nam nenema gbegbe kpɔ o, kpɔ o
No one knew what to do with it.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi wòawɔ kplii o.
I already did everything right	Mewɔ nusianu nyuie xoxo
It’s very appropriate for me.	Edze nam ŋutɔ.
It is the opposite.	Enye nusi to vovo na ema.
I haven’t seen you yet.	Nyemekpɔ wò haɖe o.
But it is the right thing to do.	Gake enye nusi sɔ.

I had to be ready to go.	Ele be manɔ klalo be mayi.

However, you never know.	Ke hã, mènya gbeɖe o.

I also want to say a few words about it	Medi hã be magblɔ nya ʋɛ aɖewo tso eŋu

I hope everything works out for him	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nusianu anyo nɛ
I just don’t know how to approach you	Ðeko nyemenya alesi mate ɖe ŋuwò o

It was a huge mistake.	Vodada gã aɖee wònye.
He wasn’t here either.	Menɔ afisia hã o.
I did it for you.	Mewɔe na wò.
But that’s not the only reason.	Gake menye ema koe nye susu si tae o.
I just survived.	Ðeko metsi agbe.
That’s pretty much it.	Emae nye ema kloe.
He is not doing any kind of work.	Mele dɔ ƒomevi aɖeke wɔm o.
It is a very good quality.	Enye nɔnɔme nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.

Is he going to lose, not really.	Ðe wòle nu bu ge, ke menye ŋutɔŋutɔ oa.
We can’t give you a horse.	Míate ŋu ana sɔ wò o.
I think that’s pretty old fashioned	Mesusu be ema nye xoxo ŋutɔ
Go ahead, now.	Yi edzi, fifia.
This is more interesting.	Esia doa dzidzɔ na ame wu.
One of the reasons they are so small.	Susu siwo tae wole sue alea gbegbe ɖo la dometɔ ɖekae.
And remember who put you here.	Eye ɖo ŋku amesi tsɔ wò ɖo afisia dzi.
I actually confronted them about it	Medze ŋgɔ wo ŋutɔŋutɔ le eŋu
The reality cannot be further from the truth.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ la mate ŋu anɔ ŋgɔ wu nyateƒea o.
That made me feel better.	Ema na nye dzi dze eme.

He was a good horse.	Sɔ nyui aɖee wònye.

And that’s not like me.	Eye ema mele abe nye ene o.

In great condition.	Le nɔnɔme gã aɖe me.

That wouldn’t be so easy.	Ema manɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
I don’t think it’s much harder than that.	Nyemesusu be esia sesẽ wu ema kura o.
In fact, neither is likely to be.	Le nyateƒe me la, anɔ eme be wo dometɔ aɖeke manɔ nenema o.

I like this song.	Ha sia dzɔa dzi nam.
I told him one in one.	Megblɔ nɛ be ɖeka le ɖeka me.
Also, some items last more than a week.	Azɔ hã, nu aɖewo nɔa anyi wu kwasiɖa ɖeka.
It can’t be anything else at all.	Mate ŋu anye nu bubu aɖeke kura o.
But the dog died.	Gake avu la ku.
I’ve been here before.	Meva afisia kpɔ.
Believe me, it will be a tremendous task.	Xɔ dzinye se, anye dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.

But he wasn’t in a hurry.	Gake mewɔ kaba o.

After all, what do we know?.	Le nyateƒe me la, nukae míenya?.
I felt the same at that moment	Nenema ke mese le ɖokuinye me le ɣeyiɣi ma me
His actual death is another matter.	Eƒe ku ŋutɔŋutɔ hã nye nya bubu.
He wasn’t a king.	Menye fia aɖee o.
Everyone drove on.	Amesiame ku ʋua yi edzi.
It’s not complicated, but it’s important nonetheless.	Menye nusi me kɔ o, gake ele vevie ke hã.
I remember something different from yesterday	Meɖo ŋku nane si to vovo na etsɔ la dzi
It’s easier that way.	Ele bɔbɔe wu le mɔ ma nu.
None of them could have known anything about this new development.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu anya naneke tso nu yeye sia ŋu hafi o.

But, there are some real problems that arise.	Gake, kuxi ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖewo li siwo doa mo ɖa.

It was a great deal of fun.	Enye dzidzɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.

If there’s no issue you’re working on, it’s not great.	Ne nya aɖeke meli si ŋu nèle dɔ wɔm le o la, ke menye gã aɖeke o.

We’re not ready for that.	Míele klalo na ema o.
I'll be there tomorrow	Mava etsɔ
I just can’t be that foresighted	Ðeko nyemate ŋu akpɔ nu do ŋgɔ nenema gbegbe o
Expect his voice.	Kpɔ mɔ na eƒe gbe.
That’s a lot of it.	Ema sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
He did something to turn everyone off.	Ewɔ nane tsɔ tsi amesiame.
I am not sure who will take care of them.	Nyemeka ɖe ame si akpɔ wo dzi dzi o.
This shouldn’t be too surprising.	Mele be esia nawɔ nuku akpa o.
They are working well.	Wole dɔ wɔm nyuie.
I'm sorry, but there are rules against that for a reason.	Meɖe kuku, gake se aɖewo li siwo tsi tre ɖe ema ŋu le susu aɖe ta.
But there is an exception to this rule.	Gake nane li si to vovo na se sia.
He can’t let go of it.	Mate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu o.
I haven’t seen you in a long time	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia nyemekpɔ wò o
I always have been and always will be	Menɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi eye manɔ nenema hã
I didn’t want to go out with him	Nyemedi be mado go kplii o
This just won’t work.	Ðeko esia mawɔ dɔ o.
I don’t know where anyone else is	Nyemenya afi si ame bubu aɖeke le o
Depending on his character.	Le eƒe nɔnɔme nu.
I think that’s very important	Mesusu be ema le vevie ŋutɔ
Everyone can do that now.	Amesiame ate ŋu awɔ ema fifia.
This is partly correct.	Nya sia ƒe akpa aɖe sɔ.
This is certainly possible.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ godoo.
It seems like.	Edze abe.
I just got home, after all	Ðeko meɖo aƒeme, le nyateƒe me
Good, but strange	Nu nyui aɖe, gake ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ
I just remember being familiar with this.	Ðeko meɖo ŋku edzi be menya nu tso esia ŋu nyuie.
There was a great teacher somewhere in your life.	Nufiala gã aɖe nɔ wò agbe ƒe akpa aɖe.
I am the complete opposite.	Nyee nye nusi to vovo kura na ema.
But we only have a type.	Gake ƒomevi aɖe koe le mía si.
I need to find a job	Ele be madi dɔ aɖe
I was very excited.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
I threw them at him	Metsɔ wo ƒu gbe ɖe edzi
I needed to come into the room	Ehiã be mava xɔa me
I couldn’t make another mistake	Nyemete ŋu wɔ vodada bubu aɖeke o
I wanted something different this time	Medi nane si to vovo zi sia
A sane person cannot kill a child.	Ame si si susu le mate ŋu awu ɖevi o.
But I can’t do anything	Gake nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o
I doubt he ever had one	Meke ɖi be ɖeka nɔ esi kpɔ
There has to be a reason.	Ele be susu aɖe nanɔ anyi si tae.
I can do it there	Mate ŋu awɔe le afima
I can help myself too	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe ɖokuinye hã ŋu
That is very important.	Ema le vevie ŋutɔ.
But I have to keep going	Gake ele be mayi edzi
Not in your heart.	Menye le wò dzi me o.
I don’t want to upset them	Nyemedi be mado dziku na wo o
A man did come back to my house.	Ŋutsu aɖe trɔ va nye aƒeme nyateƒe.
No one else was there.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afima o.
He wouldn’t live without her.	Manɔ agbe eya manɔmee o.
I have been working on death for a long time	Mele dɔ wɔm tso ku ŋu ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia
I sent him to his room	Meɖoe ɖe eƒe xɔ me
It’s ‘how’ it is.	Enye ‘aleke’ wòle.
I will get to know them more in time	Mava nya wo geɖe wu le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe
My head is pretty clear.	Nye ta me kɔ nyuie.
There is probably no reason for that.	Anɔ eme be susu aɖeke meli si tae wòle nenema ɖo o.
I wasn’t happy at all	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ kura o
There are more important things to do.	Nu siwo le vevie wu li woawɔ.
None of them did that.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
I must say that he, exists	Ele be magblɔ be eya, li
He saw no one near the car.	Mekpɔ ame aɖeke le ʋua gbɔ o.
I came out to help him.	Medo go va kpe ɖe eŋu.
This error cannot occur.	Vodada sia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I don’t have many people to talk to.	Ame geɖe mele asinye maƒo nu kplii o.
He had a hard life.	Agbe sesẽ aɖe nɔ esi.
That feels like a big deal.	Ema se le eɖokui me abe nya gã aɖe ene.
Which usually works.	Nusi wɔa dɔ zi geɖe.
I worked with him for about two weeks	Mewɔ dɔ kplii abe kwasiɖa eve ene
And it can happen, too.	Eye ate ŋu adzɔ hã.
I guess what it is	Mesusu nusi wònye
But he actually has a good voice.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, eƒe gbe nyo.
I got us.	Mexɔ mí.
A little can be a big deal	Susu sue aɖe ate ŋu anye nu gã aɖe
I had a life here, and he had a life	Agbe nɔ asinye le afisia, eye eya hã nɔ agbe
He didn’t know about it.	Menya nu tso eŋu o.
In this case, that’s a good thing.	Le go sia me la, nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
I didn’t expect you to be able to help yourself	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be wò ŋutɔ àte ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu o
We couldn’t have done it without him.	Míate ŋu awɔe eya manɔmee o.
He is just new to you.	Ðeko wònye ame yeye na wò.
I can’t go on living like this	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ agbe alea o
I started that one.	Medze ɖeka ma gɔme.
This can be anything you want.	Esia ate ŋu anye nusianu si nèdi.
This is how people think about the police nonetheless.	Amewo ƒe susu le kpovitɔwo ŋu alea ke hã.
I remembered everything from the previous time	Meɖo ŋku nusianu dzi tso ɣeyiɣi si do ŋgɔ me
Nice little house.	Aƒe nyui aɖe si le sue ŋutɔ.
Please come this way.	Taflatse va to mɔ sia dzi.
It’s actually really simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, nya bɔbɔe aɖee wònye ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I stayed my first night at her house	Metsi eƒe aƒeme le nye zã gbãtɔ me
I was very happy to hear that this was the case.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ esi mese be esia le alea.
I didn’t expect him to be there	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be anɔ afima o
I hope someone here can help.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ame aɖe le afisia ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I can finally speak seriously.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu vevie mlɔeba.
He wouldn’t say that.	Magblɔ nya ma o.
I don’t know where he is.	Nyemenya afi si wòle o.
I’m the only one who can never eat.	Nye ɖeka koe nye ame si mate ŋu aɖu gbeɖe o.
There is no one on them.	Ame aɖeke mele wo dzi o.
I can’t seem to do that	Edze abe nyemate ŋu awɔ ema o ene
We have room for everyone.	Teƒe le mía si na amesiame.
Not just a little more.	Menye geɖe vie ko o.
This is a big deal for me.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe nam.
That’s because of this.	Ema le esia ta.
He probably had more money than anyone ever knew.	Ðewohĩ ga geɖe nɔ esi wu esi ame aɖeke nya kpɔ.
I knew he had no money	Menya be ga aɖeke mele esi o
Very much like a car.	Abe ʋu ene ŋutɔ.
I know about that at least	Menya nu tso nya ma ŋu ya teti
I would try everything once.	Mate nusianu kpɔ zi ɖeka.
Only now have I realized something	Fifia koe mekpɔ nane dze sii
It wasn’t easy.	Menɔ bɔbɔe o.
This seems unlikely.	Edze abe esia mate ŋu adzɔ o ene.
I don’t know where I’m doing wrong.	Nyemenya afi si mele nu gbegblẽ wɔm le o.
Things weren’t like that in real life	Nuwo menɔ nenema le agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ me o
Everything, in that moment, was alone.	Nusianu, le ɣeyiɣi ma me, nye ɖeka.
These days, not so much.	Le ŋkeke siawo me la, menye nenema gbegbe o.
Maybe something will come up.	Ðewohĩ nane ado mo ɖa.
They had many teeth.	Aɖu geɖe nɔ wo ŋu.
I was able to understand them better	Mete ŋu se wo gɔme nyuie wu
I don’t know how it got there.	Nyemenya alesi wòwɔ va ɖo afima o.
There was no mistake.	Vodada aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I don’t know anything at all	Nyemenya naneke kura o
For life.	Na agbe.
I kind of liked this fortress	Mɔ̃ sesẽ sia dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ le mɔ aɖe nu
I could have helped him	Anye ne mate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu hafi
Do your job.	Wɔ wò dɔ.
I was legally independent	Menɔ ɖokuinye si le se nu
I had nothing to say	Nya aɖeke menɔ asinye magblɔ o
I was so, so angry with him	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe, ale gbegbe
I can’t bother you.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe fu na wò o.
My people are ready.	Nye amewo le klalo.
Now, if for no other words.	Fifia, ne nya bubu aɖeke meli o.
I decided to go there too	Meɖoe be mayi afima hã
If any party objects.	Ne akpa aɖe tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
We will join him.	Míawɔ ɖeka kplii.
I was just too tired	Ðeko ɖeɖi te ŋunye akpa
None of them are true.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
It is wrong with them.	Enye nu gbegblẽ le wo ŋu.
I want my name	Medi nye ŋkɔ
Whatever works for you.	Nusianu si awɔ dɔ na wò.
Something that wasn’t the same.	Nane si menɔ abe tsã ene o.
But maybe for once he can do the opposite.	Gake ɖewohĩ zi ɖeka la, ate ŋu awɔ nusi to vovo na ema.
I had one shot at this	Tu ɖeka nɔ asinye le esia ŋu
These guys seem interesting.	Edze abe ŋutsu siawo doa dzidzɔ na ame ene.
It will definitely help me.	Akpe ɖe ŋunye godoo.
Keep your eye on it	Wò ŋku nanɔ eŋu
I have met many people in my life	Medo go ame geɖe le nye agbe me
I was the only one left.	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ anyi.
Consider something else.	Bu nu bubu aɖe ŋu kpɔ.
I told them everything that was going on	Megblɔ nusianu si le edzi yim la na wo
I allowed myself to open up to him	Meɖe mɔ na ɖokuinye ʋu eme nɛ
A face that gave nothing away	Mo si metsɔ naneke na o
I will go anywhere you want.	Mayi afi sia afi si nèdi.
I have no desire to do anything	Didi aɖeke mele menye be mawɔ naneke o
Say ‘she’, not ‘she’.	Gblɔ be ‘eya’, ke menye ‘eya’ o.
I have to go my own way	Ele be mayi nye ŋutɔ nye mɔ dzi
It would be better than that.	Anyo wu nenema.
I will be watching you.	Manɔ wò kpɔm.
I knew he was behind them	Menya be ele wo megbe
I can’t be responsible for that.	Nyemate ŋu anye amesi gbɔ ema tso o.
Another suddenly occurred to me	Bubu aɖe va susu me nam zi ɖeka
I couldn’t really figure out what was going on	Nyemete ŋu nya nusi nɔ edzi yim ŋutɔŋutɔ o
That’s the weird thing.	Emae nye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It’s just a thought.	Susu aɖe koe wònye.
I need to call someone	Ele be maƒo ka na ame aɖe
I hope you can help me out.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye mado go.
I think there’s something in us.	Mesusu be nane le mía me.
Which is longer this time	Esi didi wu zi sia
I don’t know who these people are.	Nyemenya ame siwo ame siawo nye o.
At least here we are in the same place.	Le afisia ya teti la, míele teƒe ɖeka.
Here there is nothing.	Le afisia la, naneke meli o.
the first will do it.	gbãtɔ awɔe.
That is what the word itself means.	Emae nye nusi nya la ŋutɔ fia.
I had something on my mind.	Nane nɔ susu me nam.
He wouldn’t say anything to her.	Magblɔ nya aɖeke nɛ o.
I am currently working on this myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mele dɔ wɔm tso esia ŋu fifia.
But this is a reality.	Gake esia nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Without anyone.	Ame aɖeke manɔmee.
After that, no one knows what happened.	Le ema megbe la, ame aɖeke menya nusi dzɔ o.
I might have a problem with that	Ðewohĩ kuxi aɖe nanɔ ŋunye le nya ma ŋu
I have never felt so present	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be mele afima nenema gbegbe o
Apologize if necessary.	Ðe kuku nɛ ne ehiã.
He had another reason.	Susu bubu aɖe hã nɔ esi.
I need more time for it	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi geɖe ɖe eŋu
I actually did, you know	Mewɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ, ènya
I want to be angry about this.	Medi be manɔ dziku dom ɖe nya sia ta.
No one said anything.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
That’s one of them.	Emae nye ɖeka.
But he will do what he can.	Gake awɔ nu si wòate ŋui.
I really wanted to know a little more about it	Medi vevie be manya nu tso eŋu vie
I told him he could have them	Megblɔ nɛ be ate ŋu axɔ wo
Some of them came true.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo va eme.
Ask him for help.	Bia kpekpeɖeŋu tso esi.
The car was working fine today.	Ʋua nɔ dɔ wɔm nyuie egbea.
Something that is in fact.	Nane si le nyateƒe me.
Someone who would come the summer before last year.	Ame aɖe si ava dzomeŋɔli do ŋgɔ na ƒe si va yi.
There was nothing there.	Naneke menɔ afima o.
I wish this was over	Ne ɖe esia wu enu la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
I could understand this perfectly	Mete ŋu se esia gɔme nyuie
. . . .	.
He was sick and no one wanted to come near him.	Edze dɔ eye ame aɖeke medi be yeate ɖe eŋu o.
And a man.	Kple ŋutsu aɖe.
Save everything though.	Ðe nusianu gake.
I did listen to that.	Meɖo to nya ma nyateƒe.
I couldn’t stand it there	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu le afima o
Everyone who has.	Ame sia ame si si.
I wondered if they were looking for us.	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe wole mía dim hã.
That’s some kind of issue.	Nya aɖe ƒomevi aɖee nye ema.
Same reason here.	Susu ma ke le afisia.
It’s just money for them.	Ga koe wònye na wo.
I am the one who matters.	Nyee le vevie.
But we are being mistaken.	Gake wole vodada wɔm le mía ŋu.
It has never been like that.	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o.
Call for hours.	Ƒo ka gaƒoƒo geɖe.
I had a good time tonight	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ le zã sia me
But it can be a mistake.	Gake ate ŋu anye vodada.
I was impressed with the simplicity of the apartment	Alesi xɔa me le bɔbɔe la wɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
So much work.	Dɔ geɖe ale gbegbe.
And it probably will.	Eye anɔ eme be awɔe nenema.
I stayed in my room.	Metsi nye xɔ me.
I know this is important to you	Menya be esia le vevie na mi
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
This too will pass away.	Esia hã ava yi.
Maybe it could happen again.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu adzɔ ake.
I don’t know anything about them	Nyemenya naneke tso wo ŋu o
I don’t think he can do it on his own	Nyemesusu be ate ŋu awɔe le eɖokui si o
I felt like I was in my room	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mele nye xɔ me
My life is ruined.	Nye agbe me gblẽ.
Things were going really well for him.	Nuwo nɔ edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ nɛ.
I don’t want to deal with it now	Nyemedi be manɔ te ɖe enu fifia o
He looked like a child.	Edze abe ɖevi ene.
But stop right there.	Gake tɔ ɖe afima tututu.
I can’t control myself anymore.	Nyemate ŋu aɖu ɖokuinye dzi azɔ o.
I don’t know much about you	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso ŋuwò o
I think he’s too comfortable	Mesusu be eƒe dzi dze eme akpa
It’s a bad thing.	Enye nu gbegblẽ.
I guess it’s not as weird as it could be	Mesusu be menye nusi mewɔ nuku o abe alesi wòate ŋui ene o
Death is nothing either.	Ku hã menye naneke o.
If that makes sense.	Ne susu le nya ma me.
It is not clear that this feature is really necessary.	Medze ƒã be nɔnɔme sia hiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Something is wrong with me.	Nane gblẽ le ŋunye.
This isn’t just me talking.	Menye nye koe nye esia le nu ƒom o.
I was hoping he had a good word	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be nya nyui aɖe le esi
For many reasons.	Le susu geɖe ta.
I don’t know what’s wrong	Nyemenya nusi gblẽ o
If only he could have come with us	Ne ɖe wòate ŋu ava kpli mí hafi
He had a real job.	Dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe nɔ esi.
I didn’t look back.	Nyemekpɔ megbe o.
He received nothing in return.	Mexɔ naneke ɖe eteƒe o.
So far everything is fine.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nusianu nyo.
He has been ill for some time.	Edze dɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
For some reason it struck him as odd.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, ewɔ nuku nɛ be enye nusi mewɔ nuku o.
I can’t stand this	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe esia nu o
We have two hours.	Gaƒoƒo eve le mía si.
I can pretend to be someone else	Mate ŋu awɔ abe ame bubu ene
He was a great guy.	Enye ame gã aɖe.
I can usually see past it, but not here	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu to eŋu zi geɖe, gake menye le afisia o
There was something for everyone.	Nane nɔ anyi na amesiame.
I knew what was going to happen	Menya nusi ava dzɔ
Take care of them.	Lé be na wo.
I’ve been there before.	Meva afima kpɔ.
But from time to time.	Gake tso ɣeyiɣi yi ɣeyiɣi.
I’m not going to do it	Nyemele ewɔ ge o
I am not showing off	Menye ɖe mele ɖokuinye ɖem fia o
I really need this job	Mehiã dɔ sia ŋutɔŋutɔ
Neither worked here either.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke hã mewɔ dɔ le afisia o.
He had never been able to speak.	Mete ŋu ƒo nu kpɔ o.
I need to find a job in a new city.	Ele be madi dɔ le du yeye aɖe me.
but you seem to be fine in that role.	gake edze abe èle nyuie le akpa ma me ene.
He also put a gun to her head	Etsɔ tu de eƒe ta hã me
I was trying to talk myself into it	Menɔ agbagba dzem be maƒo nu na ɖokuinye ɖe eme
I didn’t see or hear anyone.	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke alo se nya aɖeke o.
He is not here now.	Mele afisia fifia o.
I got to finish my work here	Mekpɔ mɔ awu nye dɔa nu le afisia
I know this house.	Menya aƒe sia.
Not sure if this is true.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be nya sia nye nyateƒe o.
This result is interesting.	Nusi do tso eme sia doa dzidzɔ na ame.
Perhaps there is still time.	Ðewohĩ ɣeyiɣi gakpɔtɔ li.

I told you we had to organize	Megblɔ na mi be ele be míawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe nu ŋu
It all just kind of happened.	Ðeko wo katã dzɔ le mɔ aɖe nu.
It’s his first year here.	Enye eƒe ƒe gbãtɔ le afisia.
He will be so happy.	Akpɔ dzidzɔ ale gbegbe.
I should have said something earlier	Ðe wòle be magblɔ nya aɖe do ŋgɔ hafi
And probably no time in the near future.	Eye ɖewohĩ le ɣeyiɣi aɖeke me le etsɔ si gbɔna kpuie me o.
There appears to be another small room in the background.	Edze abe xɔ sue bubu aɖe le megbe ene.
This project is a new part of our project.	Dɔ sia nye míaƒe dɔa ƒe akpa yeye aɖe.
There is no one.	Ame aɖeke meli o.

I remembered that	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi
I couldn’t lie to him.	Nyemete ŋu da alakpa nɛ o.
This issue is certainly not new.	Nya sia menye nu yeye o godoo.
Something like that.	Nu aɖe si le abe ema ene.
No one can achieve anything alone.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu aɖo naneke gbɔ eya ɖeka o.
In fact, the opposite is true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae nye nyateƒe.
I think it could be that	Mesusu be ate ŋu anye nenema
Manufacturing costs a lot of money.	Nuwo wɔwɔ xɔa ga geɖe.
There was nothing for me.	Naneke menɔ anyi nam o.
Without clothes or clothes.	Awu alo awu aɖeke manɔmee.
Yet the issue is stable.	Ke hã nya la li ke.
Interesting statement home.	Nya si doa dzidzɔ na ame aƒe.
It will be good for him.	Anyo nɛ.
I knew exactly what he was doing	Menya nusi wɔm wònɔ nyuie
Some did get sick.	Ame aɖewo dze dɔ nyateƒe.
Not great, but not bad either.	Menye gã o, gake menye nu gbegblẽ hã o.
People were going to die.	Amewo nɔ ku ge.
This school is going to hurt you.	Suku sia le nu gblẽ ge le asiwò.
I also had to shave my hair	Ele be maɖe nye ɖa hã
Hold the word.	Lé nya la ɖe asi.
You're doing just fine without me.	Èle edzi dzem nyuie nye manɔmee.
I think this is not true	Mesusu be esia menye nyateƒe o
He can understand it.	Ate ŋu ase egɔme.
I made one mistake all these years	Mewɔ vodada ɖeka le ƒe siawo katã me
Hopefully this will work better for me.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be esia awɔ dɔ nam nyuie wu.
But none of them tried.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖeke medze agbagba o.

The logic is the same.	Susu si le eme hã le ɖeka.

I had to be on my own for everyone there	Ele be manɔ ɖokuinye dzi na amesiame si le afima
I just couldn’t talk to anyone	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ƒo nu na ame aɖeke o
Maybe there is something in it.	Ðewohĩ nane le eme.
However this doesn’t seem to work.	Ke hã edze abe esia mewɔa dɔ o ene.
He wasn't going to let this go.	Menye ɖe wòle asi ɖe ge le esia ŋu o.
Blood in my mouth.	Ʋu le nye nu me.
Yet it is necessary.	Ke hã ehiã.
Everything is something.	Nusianu nye nane.

It seems easy to me.	Edze nam be ele bɔbɔe nam.

Just like everyone else in this town.	Abe alesi ko ame bubu ɖesiaɖe le du sia me ene.

Not really, anyway.	Menye nyateƒe o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.

I couldn’t hear anyone now	Nyemete ŋu se ame aɖeke ƒe gbe fifia o
Use that against him.	Zã ema ɖe eŋu.
And we had it.	Eye wònɔ mía si.
So far, it seems.	Vaseɖe fifia la, edze abe.
I’m an only child, too	Vi ɖeka koe menye, nye hã
I came to say hello	Meva be mado gbe nam
The best ones are expensive.	Wo dometɔ siwo nyo wu la xɔ asi ŋutɔ.

He didn’t forgive anything.	Metsɔ naneke ke o.
I can’t do anything about it now	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso eŋu fifia o
Like his own name, in fact.	Abe eya ŋutɔ ƒe ŋkɔ ene, le nyateƒe me.
This is wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.	Esia nye nu gbegblẽ vodada gbegblẽ vodada vodada vodada.
I think it could very well be	Mesusu be ate ŋu anɔ nenema ŋutɔ
My car just started doing this.	Ðeko nye ʋua dze esia wɔwɔ gɔme teti koe nye ema.
Slightly higher price, but not by much.	Asi si kɔ vie wu, gake menye to geɖe dzi o.
Maybe he will tell me more in the coming days.	Ðewohĩ agblɔ nya geɖe nam le ŋkeke siwo gbɔna me.
We don’t have that.	Ema mele mía si o.
I can see them	Mete ŋu kpɔa wo ɖa
I was in denial for so long	Menɔ gbegbe me ɣeyiɣi didi alea gbegbe
There was no one with him.	Ame aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
I can’t continue to be so cheap	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ asi bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o
It's very annoying	Enye nusi doa dziku na ame ŋutɔ
I intend to do better.	Meɖoe be mawɔ dɔ nyuie wu.
None of us were actually there.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke menɔ afima ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
You never know who might be there.	Mènya amesi ate ŋu anɔ afima gbeɖe o.
This is something no one has done in years.	Esia nye nusi ame aɖeke mewɔ kpɔ le ƒe geɖe me o.
I always did my job, and I did it well.	Mewɔa nye dɔ ɣesiaɣi, eye mewɔe nyuie.
This is so wonderful.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ ale gbegbe.
I’m glad they liked it.	Edzɔ dzi nam be edzɔ dzi na wo.
I haven’t heard anything about it yet	Nyemese nya aɖeke tso eŋu haɖe o
I had absolutely no idea what was going on	Nyemenya nusi nɔ edzi yim kura o

I’m glad he’s on our side.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ele míaƒe akpa dzi.
I’m not sure he’s sane	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be eƒe susu le nu ŋu o
I had to find a new place to live	Ele be madi teƒe yeye aɖe si manɔ
None of them were happy.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mekpɔ dzidzɔ o.
Something else had to be done.	Ele be woawɔ nu bubu aɖe.

What is that.	Nukae nye ema.
And it was so.	Eye wònɔ nenema.
Perhaps this shouldn’t surprise us.	Ðewohĩ mele be esia nawɔ nuku na mí o.
I will live with it	Manɔ agbe kplii
I got really fucked up	Meva nɔ fu ɖem nam ŋutɔŋutɔ
It’s definitely someone’s character!.	Enye ame aɖe ƒe nɔnɔme godoo!.
I’ve never seen anyone so close	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke te ɖe ŋunye alea kpɔ o
Everyone was against it.	Amesiame tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I don’t mean to say you are	Menye ɖe meɖoe be magblɔ be ènye nenema o
So many people.	Ame geɖe ale gbegbe.
No one believed me.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ dzinye se o.
I am a normal person.	Nyee nye ame si ƒe nɔnɔme sɔ.
I didn’t like that guy.	Ŋutsu ma medze ŋunye o.
I put on a good face	Metsɔ mo nyui aɖe ɖo edzi
Something is going on here.	Nane le edzi yim le afisia.
None of us ever really knew anything.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke menya naneke ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o.
It’s very clear.	Eme kɔ ŋutɔ.
I'm pretty sure you can go on without it though.	Meka ɖe edzi ŋutɔ be àte ŋu ayi edzi manɔmee ke hã.
No one has taken title to the car yet.	Ame aɖeke mexɔ ʋua ƒe ŋkɔ vaseɖe fifia o.
A car cut off the deck.	Ʋu aɖe tso ʋua ƒe akpa si le ʋua me la ɖa.
I asked that question before.	Mebia nya ma do ŋgɔ.
I don’t know what to tell you.	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ na wò o.
Get out of the car.	Tso ʋua me.
It had been a bad day at work.	Ŋkeke gbegblẽ aɖee wònye le dɔme tsã.
There, or there, or there.	Afima, alo afima, alo afima.
We’re short this week.	Míele kpuie le kwasiɖa sia me.
I have to find something, some way	Ele be madi nane, mɔ aɖe dzi
Here in this room.	Le xɔ sia me afisia.
I want this between us.	Medi be esia nanɔ mía dome.
I’m not giving up.	Nyemele asi ɖem le eŋu o.
I gave you what you wanted	Metsɔ nu si nèdi la na wò
It is the law.	Enye se la.
Glad to hear that	Edzɔ dzi nam be mese nya ma
But not by much.	Gake menye to nu geɖe dzi o.
I lived in bright times	Menɔ agbe le ɣeyiɣi siwo me kɔ nyuie me
I started talking about it	Medze egɔme nɔ nu ƒom tso eŋu
This is anything but true.	Esia nye nusianu si menye nyateƒe o.
I could go with that one too	Mate ŋu ayi kple ɖeka ma hã
The work is about	Dɔa ku ɖe .
These two are different.	Ame eve siawo to vovo.
I want to see that house	Medi be makpɔ aƒe ma
He probably doesn’t know any better.	Anɔ eme be menya nu bubu aɖeke wu ema o.
It seemed impossible to make a mistake.	Edze abe vodada aɖeke mate ŋu adzɔ le eŋu o ene.
Give it this for that.	Na esia ɖe ema ta.
It’s a very complicated thing.	Enye nusi me kɔ ŋutɔ.
I am going to figure this out on my own	Mele esia ŋu bu ge le ɖokuinye si
But he might need some help getting out of here.	Gake ɖewohĩ ahiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖe hafi ado le afisia.
Which surprised him.	Nusi na wòwɔ nuku nɛ.
Not after this morning.	Menye le ŋdi sia megbe o.
What a wonderful man he was.	Ŋutsu nyui kae nye si.
That was enough for me.	Ema sɔ gbɔ nam ŋutɔ.
I can do things.	Mate ŋu awɔ nu.
But it’s amazing .	Gake ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ .
Somewhere where people are.	Afi aɖe si amewo le.
I want a period of a week	Medi be ɣeyiɣi aɖe nanɔ anyi kwasiɖa ɖeka
I don’t know what came over me.	Nyemenya nusi va to dzinye o.
But there was nothing in it.	Gake naneke menɔ eme o.
But we have a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖe le mía ŋu.
Such beautiful, expensive pieces.	Akpa siwo nya kpɔ ŋutɔ, siwo xɔ asi alea.
There can never be anyone else.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi gbeɖe o.
It didn’t look very good tonight.	Medze nyuie ŋutɔ le zã sia me o.
All on its own.	Le eɖokui katã dzi.
You may end up here.	Àte ŋu ava wu enu ɖe ​​afisia.
He has a good point.	Nya nyui aɖe le esi.
A voice spoke to his mind	Gbe aɖe ƒo nu tso eƒe susu ŋu
Much more than anyone else has ever done.	Nu geɖe wu alesi ame bubu ɖesiaɖe wɔe kpɔ.
None of us can do it.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋui o.
He doesn’t know any better.	Menya nu nyuie wu o.
There are at least two sides to this thing.	Akpa eve ya teti le nu sia ŋu.
He can stay where he is.	Ate ŋu anɔ afisi wòle.
But in many ways, it is not.	Gake le mɔ geɖe nu la, mele nenema o.
They all died here.	Wo katã ku le afisia.
Out of many, one.	Le ame geɖe dome la, ɖeka.
He is in the car now.	Ele ʋua me fifia.
I can’t do it for you	Nyemate ŋu awɔe na wò o
You can do the same thing.	Wò hã àte ŋu awɔ nenema ke.
This made sense.	Susu nɔ esia me.
If anything, it worked too well.	Ne nane li la, ke ewɔ dɔ nyuie akpa.
Somehow he couldn’t quite get there.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, mete ŋu ɖo afima tututu o.
Probably one less in demand.	Ðewohĩ ɖeka si le ʋɛ wu le didi me.
Look at your own preferences.	Lé ŋku ɖe nu siwo wò ŋutɔ nèdi la ŋu.
There is one truth.	Nyateƒe ɖeka aɖe li.
I hope it goes well anyway.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be azɔ nyuie le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
This happened here.	Esia dzɔ le afisia.
I felt more relaxed after my session	Meɖe dzi ɖi wu le nye kpekpea megbe
Something else came to mind.	Nu bubu aɖe hã va susu me nɛ.
We have too much.	Nu geɖe le mía si akpa.
This is behind the scenes.	Esia nye nusi dzɔ le megbe.
I didn’t see you there	Nyemekpɔ wò le afima o
I couldn’t figure out what it was	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi wònye la dze sii o
Now, this is something like that.	Azɔ, esia nye nane si le abe ema ene.
Now, we’re showing everyone our lives.	Fifia, míele míaƒe agbe ɖem fia amesiame.
I'm really sorry for earlier, I'm sorry for everything	Meɖe kuku ŋutɔŋutɔ le do ŋgɔ ta, meɖe kuku le nusianu ta
I can’t really see anything else	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nu bubu aɖeke ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I just knew it was a problem	Ðeko menya be enye kuxi
I did that but it didn’t work.	Mewɔe nenema gake mewɔ dɔ o.
I didn’t hear anything like that	Nyemese naneke le eme nenema o
It didn’t surprise me at all.	Mewɔ nuku nam kura o.
I was always an annoyance to him	Menye nusi doa dziku nɛ ɣesiaɣi
It needs more.	Ehiã geɖe wu.
Things he never said.	Nu siwo megblɔ kpɔ o.
Nothing really, nothing helpful.	Naneke meli ŋutɔŋutɔ o, naneke meli si akpe ɖe ame ŋu o.
I do this quite often.	Mewɔa esia zi geɖe ŋutɔ.
The reason for this is simple.	Susu si ta wòwɔ esia ɖo la le bɔbɔe.
I didn’t feel anything	Nyemese naneke le ɖokuinye me o
It’s the same ship, after all.	Enye meli ma ke, le nyateƒe me.
But none of us did that.	Gake mía dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
I understand a lot now	Mese nu geɖe gɔme fifia
But he was a good man.	Gake ame nyui aɖee.
He didn’t promise we would fight	Medo ŋugbe be míawɔ avu o
I think he is doing pretty well	Mesusu be ele edzi dzem nyuie ŋutɔ
I felt my heart dropping	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze anyi
One of the few things we can count on in life.	Nu ʋɛ siwo ŋu míate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖo le agbe me la dometɔ ɖeka.
It could always be better	Ate ŋu anyo wu ɣesiaɣi
But that would be a challenge.	Gake ema anye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
But I'll be quick	Gake mawɔ kaba
I guess you couldn’t have known that	Mesusu be màte ŋu anya ema hafi o
It’s a very complicated thing.	Enye nusi sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I was also a little worried	Metsi dzi vie hã
The past few months have been tough.	Ɣleti ʋɛ siwo va yi la sesẽ ŋutɔ.
The first one didn’t.	Gbãtɔ mewɔe nenema o.
I can’t always be so passive	Nyemate ŋu anye nusi mewɔa naneke o alea ɣesiaɣi o
But there was only one small problem with that strategy.	Gake kuxi sue ɖeka koe nɔ aɖaŋu ma ŋu.
What you want but don’t want.	Nusi nèdi gake mèdi o.
One, two, or more at a time.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka, eve, alo esi wu nenema le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
But he didn’t seem to mind.	Gake edze abe meɖe fu nɛ o ene.
I’m not going to do this.	Nyemele esia wɔ ge o.
That’s important for a couple of reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae ema le vevie ɖo.
This is not anger.	Esia menye dziku o.
And somehow that was enough.	Eye le mɔ aɖe nu la, ema sɔ gbɔ.
I don’t see what else we can do though	Nyemekpɔ nu bubu si míate ŋu awɔ o gake
That can take a very long time.	Ema ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ.
Always my full name.	Nye ŋkɔ bliboa ɣesiaɣi.
I can’t imagine his death	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ eƒe ku le susu me o
That sounds about right.	Nya ma ɖi nya si sɔ.
I don’t have a single idea that matches them	Susu ɖeka aɖeke mele asinye si sɔ kple wo o
Anything other than what you have is a lie.	Nusianu si to vovo na nu si le asiwò la nye alakpa.
I have to stay on it	Ele be manɔ edzi
I lost my temper last night	Nye dziku bu le zã si va yi me
I can’t keep going much longer	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ dɔa dzi ɣeyiɣi didi wu ema o
I didn’t know what to do either.	Nye hã nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
Before you act, think about it.	Hafi nàwɔ nane la, bu eŋu kpɔ.
I know what the truth is	Menya nusi nye nyateƒea
No one wants to get close to you.	Ame aɖeke medi be yeate ɖe ŋuwò o.
I'll come with you	Mava kpli wò
He could have gone out earlier.	Ate ŋu ado go do ŋgɔ hafi.
I am not sure exactly where it is.	Nyemeka ɖe teƒe si tututu wòle dzi o.
There is still much to do.	Nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.
But we are in a hurry.	Gake míele du dzi.
You thought it never bothered you.	Èsusu be meɖe fu na wò gbeɖe o.
It’s totally normal.	Enye nusi sɔ kura.
That’s not part of his job.	Ema menye eƒe dɔa ƒe akpa aɖeke o.
The first may be impractical.	Gbãtɔ ate ŋu anye esi mate ŋu awɔ dɔ o.
This is not necessarily the case.	Esia mele nenema kokoko o.
What is good is some words.	Nusi nyo enye nya aɖewo.
I just liked the system that was working for me.	Ðeko ɖoɖo si nɔ dɔ wɔm nam la dze ŋunye.
As it proceeds.	Esi wòle edzi yim la.
I worked there for a year	Mewɔ dɔ le afima ƒe ɖeka
It will never be like that.	Manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
This was a surprise to us.	Esia wɔ nuku na mí ŋutɔ.
I have a big day tomorrow	Ŋkeke gã aɖe le asinye etsɔ
She does not want a man to be treated that way.	Medi be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋutsu ŋu nenema o.
I was very interested in him	Metsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ ŋutɔ
I used to work here.	Tsã la, mewɔa dɔ le afisia.
He still couldn't decide what to do.	Mete ŋu tso nya me le nusi wòawɔ ŋu kokoko o.
In fact, it’s pretty smart.	Le nyateƒe me la, edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ.
It worked for me a lot.	Ewɔ dɔ nam ŋutɔ.
I was very much in that moment.	Menɔ ɣeyiɣi ma me ŋutɔ.
This is not true.	Esia mewɔ ɖeka kple nyateƒe o.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
Among these people.	Le ame siawo dome.
But we don’t have that.	Gake ema mele mía si o.
It’s just in it.	Ðeko wòle eme.
Who knows nothing.	Ame si menya naneke o.

Now that can only be a good thing!.	Fifia nu nyui koe ema ate ŋu anye!.
I just have a lot on my mind	Ðeko nu geɖe le susu me nam
This guy liked it.	Ŋutsu sia dze eŋu.
You may have to do this in two sessions.	Ðewohĩ ahiã be nàwɔ esia le ɣeyiɣi eve me.
And so far it has been.	Eye vaseɖe fifia la, ele nenema.
I have no desire to be there with him	Didi aɖeke mele menye be manɔ afima kplii o
It’s just part of us.	Mía ƒe akpa aɖe koe wònye.
I can’t stay here that long	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afisia ɣeyiɣi didi nenema gbegbe o
I really don’t know	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya o
I just showed you how easy it is.	Ðeko meɖe alesi wòle bɔbɔe la fia wò.
I got dressed quickly and hurried out of the house	Medo awu kaba eye mewɔ kaba do go le aƒea me
This seems to be true.	Edze abe nya sia nye nyateƒe ene.
Maybe everything will be fine.	Ðewohĩ nusianu anyo.
You can’t do this this way.	Màte ŋu awɔ esia alea o.
Some parts of it are still there.	Eƒe akpa aɖewo gakpɔtɔ li.
Something sick in that city.	Nane si dze dɔ le du ma me.
It seems easy.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe ene.
That thought was very distressing to me	Susu ma te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
Lots of things that need to be done	Nu geɖe siwo wòle be woawɔ
Speak, speak, speak.	Ƒo nu, ƒo nu, ƒo nu.
This is going to be my life now.	Esia ava nye nye agbe fifia.
What everyone did was amazing.	Nusi amesiame wɔ la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I really liked this	Esia dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
I assured him it would be fine	Meka ɖe edzi nɛ be anyo
Spring and summer.	Dzomeŋɔli kple dzomeŋɔli.
I fell backwards.	Medze anyi ɖe megbe.
I know exactly what to do now	Menya nusi tututu mawɔ fifia
So be diligent in doing what is right.	Eya ta do vevie nu le nu nyui wɔwɔ me.
Something he had never seen before.	Nane si mekpɔ kpɔ o.
The police won’t go there.	Kpovitɔwo mayi afima o.
I know what time it is	Menya ɣeyiɣi si me wòle
I know everyone has a role to play.	Menya be akpa aɖe le amesiame si wòawɔ.

I happen to know that.	Edzɔ be menya nya ma.
I know them all very well	Menya wo katã nyuie ŋutɔ
We have two of them.	Eve le mía si.
No one else has ever done that.	Ame bubu aɖeke mewɔ nu ma kpɔ o.
There is a place there.	Teƒe aɖe le afima.
I think that’s a big mistake.	Mesusu be vodada gã aɖee nye ema.
I have to do the right thing	Ele be mawɔ nu si sɔ
I almost promised you	Medo ŋugbe na wò kloe
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
You can discover where the money will be.	Àte ŋu ake ɖe afisi ga la anɔ ŋu.
Nothing else is possible.	Nu bubu aɖeke mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I think this is obvious.	Mesusu be esia dze ƒã.
There is definitely some smoke.	Dzudzɔ aɖewo li godoo.
Usually anyway.	Zi geɖe la, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I don’t know anything about that	Nyemenya naneke tso nya ma ŋu o
I just work harder myself.	Ðeko nye ŋutɔ mewɔa dɔ sesĩe wu.
I couldn’t believe myself	Nyemete ŋu xɔ ɖokuinye dzi se o

They are united in this.	Wole ɖeka le esia me.

It’s a normal thing.	Enye nusi sɔ.
They are up to no good.	Wole vaseɖe nyui aɖeke dzi o.

But it shouldn’t surprise him.	Gake mele be wòawɔ nuku nɛ o.
Maybe it’s better.	Ðewohĩ eƒe nɔnɔme nyo wu.
I just thought it would help my work	Ðeko mesusu be akpe ɖe nye dɔa ŋu
I have been relaxed	Meɖe dzi ɖi kpɔ
This was very exciting for me	Esia do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
I don’t know what to do	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o
I wasn’t that worried	Menye nyee tsi dzi nenema gbegbe o
I don’t think it is.	Nyemesusu be ele nenema o.
Unlikely, but possible!.	Manɔ eme o, gake anya wɔ!.
I’m still not sure.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi kokoko o.
I still don’t want to be with anyone	Nyemedi kokoko be manɔ ame aɖeke gbɔ o
Maybe a book would help, is.	Ðewohĩ agbalẽ aɖe akpe ɖe ame ŋu, enye.
None of them will do it.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mawɔe o.
You can do the same thing.	Àte ŋu awɔ nenema ke.
I needed to know what happened to him	Ehiã be manya nusi dzɔ ɖe edzi
I don’t know his name.	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ o.
I lost everything.	Nusianu bu nam.
I needed to save his life.	Ehiã be maɖe eƒe agbe.
I’ll do that for you	Mawɔ nu ma na wò
Tell the truth!.	Gblɔ nyateƒea!.
But there is a problem here.	Gake kuxi aɖe le afisia.
A year is a long time	Ƒe ɖeka nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe
And everyone got according to their kind.	Eye ame sia ame xɔ le eƒe ƒomevi nu.

I couldn’t imagine anything	Nyemete ŋu tsɔ naneke le susu me o
I can’t tell you his name	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ eƒe ŋkɔ na wò o
I couldn’t eat any of it	Nyemete ŋu ɖu eƒe ɖeke o
You should not make this mistake.	Mele be nàwɔ vodada sia o.
I didn’t know you could do that	Nyemenya be àte ŋu awɔ nu ma o
I will continue to work with him.	Mayi edzi anɔ dɔ wɔm kplii.
Two are different.	Eve to vovo.
But not now, though.	Gake menye fifia o.
A very simple task.	Dɔ bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔ.
There was so much to work on.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi siwo ŋu woawɔ dɔ le.
I needed to stay	Ehiã be manɔ anyi
I was worried and worried.	Metsi dzi eye metsi dzi.
That’s enough to fight for a day.	Ema sɔ gbɔ be woawɔ avu ŋkeke ɖeka.
I wonder where they all are today	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be afikae wo katã wole egbea hã
I am doing pretty well there.	Mele nu wɔm nyuie ŋutɔ le afima.
I need to make some calls.	Ele be maƒo ka aɖewo.

No one can do it.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋui o.
Everyone does this in their own time.	Ame sia ame wɔa esia le eya ŋutɔ ƒe ɣeyiɣi dzi.
It’s a necessary part of life, part of reality.	Enye agbe ƒe akpa si hiã, nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ƒe akpa aɖe.
I couldn’t see his face	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ eƒe mo o
The room changed.	Xɔa me trɔ.
I had a great time last night	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ le zã si va yi me
I gave my word.	Metsɔ nye nya la na.
I just do it anyway.	Ðeko mewɔa esia le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
It’s very obvious.	Edze ƒã ŋutɔ.

This is a rule.	Esia nye se.
But one thing still bugs me.	Gake nu ɖeka aɖe gakpɔtɔ le fu ɖem nam.

But in the present case.	Gake le nya si me míele fifia me la,...

Things weren’t there.	Nuwo menɔ anyi o.

And he never did anything after that.	Eye mewɔ naneke le ema megbe kpɔ o.

I can’t remember what my time was last time	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nusi nye ɣeyiɣi nye zi mamlɛtɔ dzi o
I didn’t mind, he wanted	Meɖe fu nam o, eya didi
A tired voice whispered	Gbe aɖe si ŋu ɖeɖi te la nɔ nya aɖe ƒom
There is nothing he can know.	Naneke meli wòate ŋu anya o.
You are making great progress.	Èle ŋgɔ yim ŋutɔ.
I was missing something here	Nane nɔ to yim nam le afisia
I don’t think that’s possible.	Nyemesusu be ema anya wɔ o.
I couldn’t understand it	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme o
But there is more to it than that.	Gake nu geɖe wu ema.
I am just one person	Ame ɖeka koe menye
Give it a hand.	Do asi ɖe eŋu.
I don’t have much time	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele asinye o
I could go on and on.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim.
That’s all there is to it.	Ema koe nye nu.
I didn’t mean to shoot you like that	Menye ɖe meɖoe be maƒo tu ɖe ŋuwò nenema o
Maybe he didn’t.	Ðewohĩ mewɔe nenema o.
His character is very difficult.	Eƒe nɔnɔme sesẽ ŋutɔ.
It could be any time now.	Ate ŋu anye ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe fifia.
I think, he will understand	Mesusu be, ase egɔme
A really nice guy, though	Ŋutsu nyui aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ, gake
I don’t know what to do yet	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ haɖe o
And it’s a great thing.	Eye nu gã aɖee wònye.
It is true that.	Enye nyateƒe be.
He didn’t want to do this.	Medi be yeawɔ esia o.
That doesn’t make sense to me.	Susu mele nya ma me nam o.
I told him he would be home tomorrow	Megblɔ nɛ be ava aƒeme etsɔ
That works well so far.	Ema wɔa dɔ nyuie vaseɖe fifia.
I haven’t heard of anyone doing that yet.	Nyemese ame aɖeke wɔ nu ma haɖe o.
There is a small problem here	Kuxi sue aɖe le afisia
I could be me.	Mate ŋu anye nye.
I think that’s really good for him	Mesusu be ema nyo nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ
I never saw them leave or return	Nyemekpɔ wo dzo alo trɔ gbɔ kpɔ o
I knew something was up, but it wasn’t	Menya be nane le dzi yim, gake menye nenema o
I think he did a good job.	Mesusu be ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe.
Nothing works out.	Naneke mewɔa dɔ o.
Just a little bit.	Vi aɖe ko.
He had no one to deal with.	Ame aɖeke menɔ esi wòawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu o.
It is going to take a long time.	Ele ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe xɔ ge.
Things he could tell her.	Nu siwo wòate ŋu agblɔ nɛ.
I came here for a different reason	Susu bubu aɖe tae meva afisia ɖo
I’m not sure what’s right	Nyemeka ɖe nusi sɔ dzi o
I like that quality about you	Nɔnɔme ma dzɔa dzi nam le ŋuwò
The same is true of doing good.	Nu nyui wɔwɔ hã le nenema.
I could feel the intensity of his anger	Mete ŋu se eƒe dziku ƒe sesẽ la gɔme nyuie
This is simply not the case here.	Ðeko esia mele alea le afisia o.
Tell me more about it.	Gblɔ nu geɖe nam.
He just couldn’t do it.	Ðeko mete ŋu wɔe o.
I would have loved to see them together	Anye ne adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ne mekpɔ wo ɖekae hafi
I could see what he was doing	Mete ŋu kpɔ nu si wɔm wònɔ
In fact, it’s quite the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo kura.
I already knew he wouldn’t	Menya xoxo be mawɔe o
I threw them all away	Metsɔ wo katã ƒu gbe
I was convinced that everything that happened was real	Meka ɖe edzi be nusianu si dzɔ la nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ
It was such a waste.	Enye gbegblẽ alea gbegbe.
People didn’t care.	Amewo metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
As is your case.	Abe alesi wò nya la le ene.
I don’t know anything about them	Nyemenya naneke tso wo ŋu o
I was also able to rely on him last year	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋu ɖe eŋu hã le ƒe si va yi me
This result is interesting for two reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae nusi do tso eme sia doa dzidzɔ na ame.
I had no food or water	Nuɖuɖu alo tsi aɖeke menɔ asinye o
I tried to stay busy	Medze agbagba be vovo manɔ dɔ ŋu o
I didn’t shower the first week	Nyemele tsi le kwasiɖa gbãtɔ me o
And not for the first time.	Eye menye zi gbãtɔ hã o.
I knew he never would	Menya be mawɔe gbeɖe o
He couldn’t see past them.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu wu wo o.
You already know what that will do to prices.	Ènya nusi ema awɔ ɖe nuwo ƒe asi ŋu xoxo.
I had a lot of work there	Dɔ geɖe nɔ asinye le afima
I don’t know how he knew about it.	Nyemenya alesi wòwɔ nya nu tso eŋu o.
Things he couldn’t understand.	Nu siwo gɔme mete ŋu se o.
I don’t want to stay.	Nyemedi be manɔ anyi o.
I have a little bit of it	Vi aɖe le ŋunye
I still have to schedule that one	Ele kokoko be mawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ɖeka ma ŋu
I remember how people looked at me	Meɖo ŋku ale si amewo kpɔm la dzi
Some of them are different from each other.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo to vovo na wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
They had been taken by the police.	Kpovitɔwo xɔ wo kpɔ.
I was completely surprised	Ewɔ nuku nam kura
I almost felt for him	Mese le ɖokuinye me kloe ɖe eŋu
Everything else was there.	Nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nɔ afima.
Or maybe like any of them.	Alo ɖewohĩ abe wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe ene.
I just need more of the truth	Ðeko mehiã nyateƒea geɖe wu
Some teachers were also opposed.	Nufiala aɖewo hã tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
This is actually quite good.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia nyo ŋutɔ.
I have to tell everyone this its too good	Ele nam be magblɔ esia na amesiame eƒe nyo akpa
I haven’t seen them in a while	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia nyemekpɔ wo o
I was unable to contact you last hour	Nyemete ŋu do ka kpli wò le gaƒoƒo si va yi me o
But there is no help.	Gake kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke meli o.
There is no smoke without fire.	Dzudzɔ aɖeke meli dzo manɔmee o.
I felt the same way	Nye hã mese le ɖokuinye me nenema ke
I just want that to be just you	Ðeko medi be wò koe nye ema
This would be impossible.	Esia anye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o.
He wanted nothing to do with her.	Medi be yeawɔ naneke kplii o.
And we’re not going anywhere.	Eye míele afi aɖeke yim o.
That happened.	Ema dzɔ.
He can’t stay here.	Mate ŋu anɔ afisia o.
And, a little bit about you.	Eye, vi aɖe tso ŋuwò.
I have a life here now	Agbe le asinye le afisia fifia
I just blinked and looked away	Ðeko meɖe ŋku ɖe eŋu eye meɖe ŋku ɖa
It is just like	Ðeko wòle abe .
I told him I was very pleased	Megblɔ nɛ be edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
Your snake that is never here.	Wò da si mele afisia gbeɖe o.
It’s a problem.	Enye kuxi.
It’s not me.	Menye nyee o.
I had already decided to continue	Meɖoe xoxo be mayi edzi
We are moving forward very strongly.	Míele ŋgɔ yim sesĩe ŋutɔ.
I made a simple plan today	Mewɔ ɖoɖo bɔbɔe aɖe egbea
There is a lot of work on this.	Dɔ geɖe le esia ŋu.
I wanted to be mad at him	Medi be mado dziku ɖe eŋu
I don’t think this is one.	Nyemesusu be esia nye ɖeka o.
To my surprise, a year has already passed	Ewɔ nuku nam be ƒe ɖeka va yi xoxo
I was going to do it	Menɔ ewɔ ge
There are many problems with this process itself.	Kuxi geɖe le ɖoɖo sia ŋutɔ ŋu.
Something a kid would do.	Nane si ɖevi aɖe awɔ.
But there is nothing there.	Gake naneke mele afima o.
I have to do it.	Ele be mawɔe.
Something new for us.	Nu yeye na mí.
I had everything in mind.	Nusianu nɔ asinye le susu me.
It’s so obvious.	Edze ƒã ale gbegbe.
I had been waiting eagerly for this night	Menɔ lalam vevie tsã le zã sia me
It's like me.	Ele abe nye ene.
I did listen the whole way.	Meɖo to le mɔ bliboa dzi nyateƒe.
And the gun, too.	Eye tu la hã.
My people cannot stand it.	Nye amewo mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu o.
I was more worried about him than I was	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu wu nye ŋutɔ
We’re getting started.	Míele egɔme dzem.
I am looking for the truth	Mele nyateƒe dim
I’m not at home for anyone.	Nyemele aƒeme na ame aɖeke o.
This piqued my curiosity.	Esia na nye didi be manya nu geɖe wu.
It all seems clear.	Edze abe wo katã me kɔ ene.
I don’t understand you a bit.	Nyemese wò gɔme vie o.
I stand for the heart.	Metsi tre ɖe dzi la ta.
I didn’t feel much of anything	Nyemese naneke le ɖokuinye me boo o
That is not true at all.	Ema menye nyateƒe kura o.
It’s a pretty good one.	Enye ɖeka nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I hope this helps you a bit.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia akpe ɖe ŋuwò vie.
I know what happened.	Menya nusi dzɔ.
I can handle them all	Mate ŋu akpɔ wo katã gbɔ
I got a lot of your blood.	Mexɔ wò ʋu geɖe.
I felt really strongly about that.	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ le nya ma ŋu.
You only have to do this once.	Zi ɖeka koe wòle be nàwɔ esia.
I had and still have a bloody mind	Susu ʋu nɔ asinye eye megale nenema kokoko
There wasn’t long waiting for them.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke menɔ wo lalam o.
I tried to speak, but my mouth was too dry	Medze agbagba be maƒo nu, gake nye nu ƒu akpa
I do everything.	Nyee wɔa nusianu.
I think you will enjoy it	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò
I didn’t understand much	Nyemese nu geɖe gɔme o
And that didn’t work.	Eye ema mewɔ dɔ o.
I’m the first one, now	Nyee nye ame gbãtɔ, fifia
I thought everything was fine	Mesusu be nusianu le nyuie
We didn’t know about it until the police came.	Míenya nu tso eŋu o vaseɖe esime kpovitɔwo va.
Or leave them alone.	Alo gblẽ wo ɖi.
You can’t just get people together and tell them to work together.	Màte ŋu aƒo amewo nu ƒu ko agblɔ na wo be woawɔ dɔ ɖekae o.
But the precursor is different.	Gake nusi doa ŋgɔ na nu la to vovo.
I think that’s enough for tonight	Mesusu be ema sɔ gbɔ na zã sia
I work, a lot, and not much else	Mewɔa dɔ, geɖe, eye menye nu bubu geɖe o
I have no desire.	Didi aɖeke mele asinye o.
I shouldn’t have done that	Mele be mawɔ nu ma hafi o
I'm the one	Nye ya
But it didn’t bother me	Gake meɖe fu nam o
I wonder why he is doing that	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae wòle nu ma wɔm hã
Or his job changed.	Alo eƒe dɔa trɔ.
I will be in the background	Manɔ megbe
He can do it.	Ate ŋu awɔe.
I didn’t get much help with it	Nyemekpɔ kpekpeɖeŋu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o
It’s been a good day so far.	Ŋkeke nyui aɖee wònye vaseɖe fifia.
I felt angry, angry	Mese le ɖokuinye me be medo dziku, do dziku
I hope you enjoy it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò
I did it all for myself	Mewɔ wo katã na ɖokuinye
I had to make a new one	Ele be mawɔ yeye aɖe
The man from this morning.	Ŋutsu si tso ŋdi sia me.
I wondered what enabled me to do that	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae na mete ŋu wɔa ema hã
I told you he wasn’t going anywhere	Megblɔ na wò be mele afi aɖeke yim o
The situation here is very different.	Nɔnɔme si le afisia to vovo kura.
However, I have this error.	Ke hã, vodada sia le asinye.
I could be here with you	Mate ŋu anɔ afisia kpli wò
This resolves the contradictions.	Esia kpɔa nya siwo tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu la gbɔ.
We are running behind.	Míele du dzi le megbe.
I just tried to save myself	Ðeko medze agbagba be maɖe ɖokuinye
He just can do it.	Ðeko wòate ŋu awɔe.
I felt he was more independent, more at peace	Mese le ɖokuinye me be eya ŋutɔ le eɖokui si wu, eƒe dzi dze eme wu
This seems to be appropriate.	Edze abe esia sɔ ene.
He is not a static person.	Menye ame si nɔa teƒe ɖeka o.
Again, this is not true.	Le afisia hã la, esia menye nyateƒe o.
I really wanted to impress this guy	Medi vevie be mawɔ dɔ ɖe ŋutsu sia dzi
I came to live with it.	Meva nɔ agbe kplii.
I do remember being somewhere else.	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyateƒe be menɔ teƒe bubu aɖe.
You have one job.	Dɔ ɖeka le asiwò.
I can’t at the moment	Nyemate ŋui le ɣeyiɣi sia me o
I had no idea these things existed	Nyemenya kura be nu siawo li o
I needed them again.	Mehiã wo ake.
I decided to do it	Meɖoe be mawɔe
I think you will enjoy it	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò
I always liked that	Ema dzɔa dzi nam ɣesiaɣi
His mouth is too dry.	Eƒe nu ƒu akpa.
I wasn’t happy about this	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe esia ŋu o
I practically sat on it.	Menɔ anyi ɖe edzi kloe.
I like that in a man	Ema dzɔa dzi nam le ŋutsu aɖe me
Right now, he doesn’t care.	Fifia la, metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
Dead by now, apparently.	Ku vaseɖe fifia, edze abe.

Ours is included.	Mía tɔ hã le eme.
This time is better than the first time.	Ɣeyiɣi sia nyo wu ɣeyiɣi gbãtɔ.
I never expected anything to come of it	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be naneke ado tso eme kpɔ o
I personally don’t know what’s wrong	Nye ŋutɔ nyemenya nusi gblẽ o
I couldn’t figure it out now though	Nyemete ŋu bu eŋu fifia o gake
I touched the nearest spot.	Meka asi teƒe si te ɖe ŋunye wu la ŋu.
They are working on quality.	Wole dɔ wɔm tso nɔnɔme nyui ŋu.
I was satisfied	Nye dzi dze eme
I think it seems a little too personal	Mesusu be edze abe ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa vie ene
I have seen more than enough	Mekpɔ nu geɖe wu esi sɔ gbɔ
But again, it could be.	Gake le afisia hã la, ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
And it is making the job harder.	Eye ele dɔa wɔm sesẽ ɖe edzi.
There was no water in it.	Tsi aɖeke menɔ eme o.
I have to speak up	Ele be maƒo nu
Or where this is.	Alo afisi esia le.
It doesn’t work though.	Mewɔa dɔ o ke hã.

Believe in me.	Xɔ dzinye se.

It just took me a while to get there.	Ðeko mexɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe hafi ɖo afima.
Everything was just great	Ðeko nusianu nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ
Until the last word.	Vaseɖe nya mamlɛtɔ dzi.
I need something that works, just once	Mehiã nane si awɔ dɔ, zi ɖeka ko
What we have has become so intricate	Nusi le mía si la me va ƒo eɖokui ɖe nu me ale gbegbe

I’m probably already late	Anɔ eme be metsi megbe xoxo
I'm not sure yet myself.	Nye ŋutɔ nyemeka ɖe edzi haɖe o.
That seems like everything.	Ema dze abe nusianu ene.
I couldn’t control it.	Nyemete ŋu ɖu edzi o.
I heard another man’s voice	Mese ŋutsu bubu ƒe gbe
Let me know about everything.	Na manya nu tso nusianu ŋu.
And he didn’t do that.	Eye mewɔe nenema o.
Everyone knew what he was doing.	Amesiame nya nusi wɔm wòle.
I never wanted to hit anyone.	Nyemedi gbeɖe be maƒo ame aɖeke o.
Now, as ever, he is alive.	Fifia, abe tsã ene la, ele agbe.
I didn’t get a job because of this	Nyemekpɔ dɔ le esia ta o
Really.	Nyateƒea.
We can work on it more.	Míate ŋu awɔ dɔ tso eŋu geɖe wu.
It wasn’t that easy for me.	Menɔ bɔbɔe nam nenema gbegbe o.
I didn’t expect to see anything now.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be makpɔ naneke fifia o.
I can’t take your help	Nyemate ŋu axɔ wò kpekpeɖeŋu o
But that one other thing never happened to us.	Gake nu ɖeka ma bubu ma dzɔ ɖe mía dzi kpɔ o.
He had never felt that way before.	Mese le eɖokui me nenema kpɔ o.
I have to do that.	Ele be mawɔe nenema.
I couldn’t take it all in, it was amazing	Nyemete ŋu xɔ wo katã ɖe eme o, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ
I only worked there for two months	Ɣleti eve koe mewɔ dɔ le afima
And he didn’t trust anyone else.	Eye meka ɖe ame bubu aɖeke dzi o.
That’s it, go ahead.	Emae nye ema, yi ŋgɔ.
Show me this.	Fia nya esia.
I lost one eye and nearly lost another	Nye ŋku ɖeka bu eye bubu bu kloe
He didn’t care about that.	Metsɔ ɖeke le nya ma me o.
It’s a totally different metal, not like any of them.	Enye ga si to vovo kura, menye abe wo dometɔ aɖeke ene o.
I had been waiting.	Menɔ lalam kpɔ.
Very little we can see in it.	Nu sue aɖe ko si míate ŋu akpɔ le eme.

Everything seemed right after that.	Edze abe nusianu le ema megbe teti ene.
But I didn’t have my own life.	Gake nye ŋutɔ nye agbe menɔ anyi o.
He will come to them.	Ava wo gbɔ.
If he had time.	Ne ɣeyiɣi nɔ esi.

Thank you in advance!.	Akpe na mi do ŋgɔ!.
Please contact us if we can help.	Taflatse te ɖe mía ŋu ne míate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
It is however a little look through.	Enye ke hã vi aɖe kpɔ to eme.

I thought something was wrong with him.	Mesusu be nane gblẽ le eŋu.
But this is often not possible.	Gake zi geɖe la, esia wɔwɔ mate ŋu adzɔ o.

I had to be tough on him	Ele be mawɔ nu sesĩe ɖe eŋu

I’m so glad he’s there, once again.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be ele afima, zi ɖeka ake.

I’ve said that to myself over and over again	Megblɔ nya ma na ɖokuinye zi gbɔ zi geɖe
But he really didn’t believe it, not really.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, mexɔ edzi se o, menye le nyateƒe me o.
Not yet, anyway.	Menye haɖe o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.

A waste of money.	Ga gbegblẽ aɖe.
He wasn't in shape for that, but it seemed important.	Menɔ nɔnɔme nyui me na ema o, gake edze abe ele vevie ene.
Everything was going well.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie.
He just did the job.	Ðeko wòwɔ dɔa.

Touched him out of surprise.	Ka asi eŋu le esi wòwɔ nuku nɛ ta.
I don’t think it matters	Mesusu be mele vevie o
No one really wants to work hard in some areas.	Ame aɖeke medi ŋutɔŋutɔ be yeawɔ dɔ sesĩe le go aɖewo me o.
He didn't like anything about the tightness around his neck.	Naneke si le eƒe kɔ ŋu sesĩe la medze eŋu o.
I just kind of want to be with you	Ðeko medi be manɔ anyi kpli wò le mɔ aɖe nu
There were so many of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe ŋutɔ nɔ anyi.
He didn’t care where he was.	Metsɔ ɖeke le afi si wòle o.
I am only living for today	Egbea koe mele agbe ɖo
A name appeared in his mind	Ŋkɔ aɖe dze le eƒe susu me
I’ve never seen that before.	Nyemekpɔ nu ma kpɔ o.
It is absolutely necessary.	Ehiã vevie ŋutɔ.
I have no reason to live	Susu aɖeke meli si tae manɔ agbe ɖo o
And it’s a lost home.	Eye enye aƒe si bu.
But he couldn’t stand it.	Gake mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o.
I can give you one more name	Mate ŋu ana ŋkɔ bubu ɖeka wò
Two shots fired.	Tu eve da tu.
An attitude we can root for	Nɔnɔme si míate ŋu aƒo ke ɖe to ɖe
He had one good year.	Ƒe nyui ɖeka nɔ esi.
Somewhere we shouldn’t be able to go.	Afi aɖe si mele be míate ŋu ayi o.
I would stay in the house for that one.	Manɔ aƒea me ɖe ame ma ta.
This is not a true statement.	Nya sia menye nyateƒe o.
I was angry, too.	Nye hã medo dziku.
Two things have improved dramatically	Nu eve aɖewo va nyo ɖe edzi ŋutɔ
They owe you your respect.	Wò bubu ƒe fe le wo ŋu.
I just thought I was having a good day	Ðeko mesusu be ŋkeke nyui aɖe le edzi yim
I just want to see something different	Ðeko medi be makpɔ nusi to vovo na ema
I don’t know what to do	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o
I honestly can’t remember everything that happened	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nusianu si dzɔ dzi o
There was a man in the back of the car	Ŋutsu aɖe nɔ ʋua megbe
I think I like you	Mesusu be wò nu lé dzi nam
Some of them are in poor health.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo ƒe lãme gblẽ.
I felt terrible for him	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ɖe eŋu
He didn’t know this guy.	Menya ŋutsu sia o.
But I don’t want to get too involved	Gake nyemedi be maƒo ɖokuinye ɖe nu ŋu akpa o
I am a little impressed	Mewɔa dɔ ɖe dzinye vie
I couldn’t understand what was going on	Nyemete ŋu se nu si nɔ edzi yim la gɔme o
He didn’t seem to mind.	Edze abe meɖe fu nɛ o ene.
I can’t let myself go there	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu ayi afima o
This work is still in progress.	Dɔ sia gakpɔtɔ le edzi yim.
I knew he was alive somewhere	Menya be ele agbe le afi aɖe
He has four children.	Vi ene le esi.
I always wanted to check this place out	Medi ɣesiaɣi be makpɔ teƒe sia ɖa le
I have to be somewhere.	Ele be manɔ afi aɖe.
I didn’t know what to say to him	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ nɛ o
I came to help him	Meva kpe ɖe eŋu
That’s good for us.	Ema nyo na mí.
Often, over and over again.	Zi geɖe la, zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
I now know that everything is lost	Menya azɔ be nusianu bu
That’s the obvious reason.	Emae nye susu si dze ƒã.
We can do it.	Míate ŋu awɔe.
I don’t want anything to do with you.	Nyemedi be naneke nawɔ ɖeka kpli wò o.
He had no clothes.	Awu aɖeke menɔ esi o.
I guess he didn’t mind	Mesusu be meɖe fu nɛ o
Please tell me the truth.	Taflatse gblɔ nyateƒea nam.
I need someone to finish it	Mehiã ame aɖe si awu enu
But you don’t expect it.	Gake mèle mɔ kpɔm nɛ o.
It’s a no-brainer.	Enye nusi me susu mele o.
The whole thing.	Nusianu bliboa.
I couldn’t go back home	Nyemete ŋu trɔ yi aƒe o
And it’s amazing.	Eye ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There is too much to do here.	Nu geɖe akpa li woawɔ le afisia.
I think he likes things the way they are	Mesusu be nuwo dzɔa dzi nɛ abe alesi wole ene
Perhaps this is true.	Ðewohĩ nya sia nye nyateƒe.
But everyone knows his name.	Gake ame sia ame nya eƒe ŋkɔ.
Everyone was so happy.	Amesiame kpɔ dzidzɔ ale gbegbe.
I had to do it to save you	Ele nam be mawɔe be maɖe wò
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
And something that isn’t you.	Eye nane si menye wò o.
But I’m a bit surprised to see you here	Gake ewɔ nuku nam vie be mekpɔ wò le afisia
As.	Abe.
This is a pretty big deal.	Esia nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I want to be happy here with him	Medi be makpɔ dzidzɔ le afisia kplii
But it will take something like that.	Gake axɔ nane si le abe ema ene.
It’s just something.	Nu aɖe koe wònye.
A completely different way	Mɔ si to vovo kura
I like that dress, actually	Awu ma dzɔa dzi nam, le nyateƒe me
I expected something like this to happen	Mekpɔ mɔ be nane si le abe esia ene adzɔ
I would do the same if it were me	Mawɔ nenema ke nenye be nyee
Not until you.	Menye vaseɖe esime wò.
I got in early	Meva ge ɖe eme kaba
It’s not just money.	Menye ga koe wònye o.
I don’t want to see anyone	Nyemedi be makpɔ ame aɖeke o
You’re better than me.	Wò nyo wu nye.
I was now in charge	Nyee nɔ dɔa dzi kpɔm fifia
I had never heard her voice so loud.	Nyemese eƒe gbe sesẽ alea kpɔ o.
There was a big fire.	Dzo gã aɖe nɔ anyi.
Everyone really knows.	Amesiame nya nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But there isn’t one.	Gake ɖeke meli o.
I can’t remember exactly what happened.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nusi tututu dzɔ dzi o.
I'm just not sure what to say	Ðeko nyemeka ɖe nya si magblɔ dzi o
There are many of us there.	Mía dometɔ geɖe le afima.
Each one has to work.	Ele be wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe nawɔ dɔ.
I am in the present.	Mele fifia la me.
I was going to say everything out loud	Menɔ nya sia nya gblɔ ge sesĩe
Any other related issues.	Nya bubu ɖesiaɖe si ku ɖe nya sia ŋu.
I know you have guns in your house too	Menya be tu le wò aƒe me hã
If possible, delegate as soon as possible.	Ne anya wɔ la, tsɔ dɔa na ame kaba.
I wondered if something was wrong	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe nane gblẽ le eŋu hã
And it stayed for hours.	Eye wònɔ anyi gaƒoƒo geɖe.
It’s a valid statement	Enye nya si sɔ
I can’t tell	Nyemate ŋu anya o
I hope they are serious.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wole vevie dom nu.
I put my hand to my head	Metsɔ nye asi ɖo nye ta ŋu
So are you, too.	Wò hã nèle nenema.
I could kill myself on my own	Mate ŋu awu ɖokuinye le ɖokuinye si
And for many reasons.	Eye le susu geɖe ta.
I’ve seen them before	Mekpɔ wo kpɔ
I also happen to be very erect now	Edzɔ hã be metsi tre ŋutɔ fifia
From now on it’s you and me.	Tso fifia dzi la, nye kple wòe.
He had worked before.	Ewɔ dɔ kpɔ do ŋgɔ.
I didn’t want to bother him	Nyemedi be maɖe fu nɛ o
It looks good.	Edze nyuie.
Want to work for our people.	Di be yeawɔ dɔ na míaƒe amewo.
I shouldn’t have joined you in that drink yet	Mele be mawɔ ɖeka kpli mi le aha ma me haɖe o
I don’t know what to do.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
My heart wasn’t in it.	Nye dzi menɔ eme o.
Maybe you can really help me.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔŋutɔ.
If only one had survived.	Ne ɖe ɖeka koe tsi agbe hafi.
I didn’t know what to do, or where to go	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ, alo afi si mayi o
I had no money for food anyway.	Ga aɖeke menɔ asinye ɖe nuɖuɖu ŋu le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I want him to have something	Medi be nane nanɔ esi
I could feel he was tired	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me be ɖeɖi te eŋu
He would never have done that.	Anye ne mawɔ nu ma gbeɖe o.
I don’t want to live without him	Nyemedi be manɔ agbe eya manɔmee o
I have one last person to deal with	Ame mamlɛtɔ ɖeka le asinye mawɔ nu kplii
We’re glad he didn’t.	Edzɔ dzi na mí be mewɔe nenema o.
I think we all know better now	Mesusu be mí katã míenya nu nyuie wu fifia
I think that part is also somewhat true	Mesusu be akpa ma hã nye nyateƒe vie
There wasn’t one of me.	Nye aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
It belongs to its own space and time.	Enye eya ŋutɔ ƒe teƒe kple ɣeyiɣi tɔ.
I can’t say anything better about anyone	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke tso ame aɖeke ŋu nyuie wu o
Strong bipartisan support for that.	Akpa eve ƒe kpekpeɖeŋu sesẽ na ema.
My mouth didn’t touch.	Nye nu meka asi nu ŋu o.
It’s just his dog.	Eƒe avu koe.
A man spoke before entering the hole	Ŋutsu aɖe ƒo nu hafi ge ɖe doa me
I know this is complicated	Menya be nya sia ŋu nya sesẽ
I am not and cannot be.	Nyemele nenema o eye nyemate ŋu anɔ nenema hã o.
I think they are.	Mesusu be wole nenema.
I hoped that he would.	Mekpɔ mɔ be awɔe nenema.
I would have been the same	Anye ne nye hã manɔ nenema hafi
You can tell the truth.	Àte ŋu agblɔ nyateƒea.
He’s a good teacher, you know.	Nufiala nyui aɖee wònye, ènya.
I was just talking to myself	Ðeko menɔ nu ƒom na ɖokuinye
He wasn’t like any of them	Menɔ abe wo dometɔ aɖeke ene o
I told him everything	Megblɔ nya sia nya nɛ
Stay away from it.	Te ɖa le eŋu.
Just his thoughts.	Eƒe susu ko.
He needs help.	Ehiã kpekpeɖeŋu.
There aren’t many people who do.	Ame geɖe meli siwo wɔa esia o.
You’ve always been like that.	Wòe nye nenema ɣesiaɣi.
I was asking you a question	Menɔ nya biam wò
I said the right thing	Megblɔ nya si sɔ
I am in the exact same situation	Mele nɔnɔme ma ke tututu me
You are not alone.	Ga le esi.
It’s something you can’t control.	Enye nusi dzi màte ŋu aɖu o.
I'm not, but it should work just fine.	Menye nyee o, gake ele be wòawɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
Everything is still there.	Nusianu gakpɔtɔ li.
No one had ever heard of it.	Ame aɖeke mese nu tso eŋu kpɔ o.
No man wants me.	Ŋutsu aɖeke medi be madi o.
Over a period of more than four hours.	Le ɣeyiɣi si wu gaƒoƒo ene me.
I just came to talk to you	Ðeko meva be maƒo nu kpli wò
I really needed to talk to him	Ehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ be maƒo nu kplii
It’s obviously important to me.	Edze ƒã be ele vevie nam.
I haven’t heard anything about that myself.	Nye ŋutɔ nyemese naneke tso ema ŋu o.
I can’t deny it	Nyemate ŋu agbe nu le eŋu o
But he either didn’t listen to me or didn’t listen to me.	Gake meɖo tom o alo meɖo tom o.
He had been very busy.	Vovo menɔ eŋu kura o tsã.
Whatever you have will work.	Nu sia nu si le asiwò la awɔ dɔ.
You, not me.	Wò, menye nye o.
I knew no one would ever do it.	Menya be ame aɖeke mawɔe gbeɖe o.
I came out here so much	Medo go le afisia ale gbegbe
I have been there myself	Nye ŋutɔ hã menɔ afima kpɔ
I tried my best.	Medze agbagba ɖesiaɖe.
I don’t know who he is	Nyemenya amesi wònye o
Promise them whatever you want	Do nu sia nu si nèdi la ŋugbe na wo
I struggle with that sort of thing	Mewɔa avu kple nu ma ƒomevi
I’m still not sure what happened.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi dzɔ dzi haɖe o.
I don’t know anything about money.	Nyemenya naneke tso ga ŋu o.
You don’t have to tell me anything.	Mehiã be nàgblɔ nya aɖeke nam o.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Vodada aɖeke mele nya sia ŋu o.
He gave her everything in return.	Etsɔ nusianu nɛ ɖe eteƒe.
We are together.	Míele ɖekae.
There were obviously some guys here.	Edze ƒã be ŋutsu aɖewo nɔ afisia.
A fire had evidently consumed part of the building	Edze ƒã be dzo aɖe ɖu xɔa ƒe akpa aɖe
It doesn’t work that way.	Mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
It’s really important that I figure this out	Ele vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ be makpɔ esia gbɔ
I know you can’t play our stuff until morning	Menya be màte ŋu aƒo míaƒe nuwo o vaseɖe ŋdi me
There is still much work to be done.	Dɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ.
I don’t need to say much	Mehiã be magblɔ nya geɖe o
But maybe it’s true.	Gake ɖewohĩ enye nyateƒe.
This is important.	Esia le vevie.
He deserved it well.	Edze nɛ nyuie.
I need to know what he wants	Ele be manya nusi dim wòle
I don’t know what that is.	Nyemenya nusi ema nye o.
While he was at work.	Esi wònɔ dɔme.
And in a way, this is true.	Eye le mɔ aɖe nu la, esia nye nyateƒe.
I am very happy with you	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe ŋuwò ŋutɔ
That’s my strategy.	Emae nye nye aɖaŋu.
But there is something wrong with it.	Gake nu gblẽ le eŋu.
I can’t do anything else .	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke o .
I didn’t really expect it.	Nyemekpɔ mɔ nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Which is almost what happened.	Nusi nye nusi dzɔ kloe.
There was great opportunity here.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe nɔ afisia.
Have a long-term plan.	Na woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
And do some good ones.	Eye wɔ nyui aɖewo.
I know a lot of things that can help you	Menya nu geɖe siwo ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò
Live in the present.	Nɔ agbe le fifia me.
I grew up and knew thousands who weren’t.	Metsi eye menya akpe geɖe siwo menye nenema o.
This is not a big deal.	Esia menye nya gã aɖeke o.
I met with him.	Medo go kplii.
I had some things to work on	Nu aɖewo nɔ asinye mawɔ dɔ tso eŋu
The people working in the building.	Ame siwo le dɔ wɔm le xɔa me.
I wanted to see his face	Medi be makpɔ eƒe mo
I knew what awaited me this time	Menya nusi nɔ lalam nam zi sia
There was something else, something that had never been there before.	Nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ anyi, nane si menɔ anyi kpɔ o.
I can live with that	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe kple ema
We don’t know what to do.	Nusi míawɔ la míenya o.
That would have explained everything.	Ema aɖe nusianu me hafi.
I can’t get it out of my heart	Nyemate ŋu aɖee le nye dzi me o
I can’t say I’m sorry enough	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ be meɖe kuku ale gbegbe o
We’re seeing that today.	Míele ema kpɔm egbea.
Look at this very building.	Kpɔ xɔ sia tututu ɖa.
And it’s just something some people won’t do.	Eye nusi ame aɖewo mawɔ o koe wònye.
I hope there is nothing from this	Mele mɔ kpɔm be naneke meli tso esia me o
The word, after all, is everything that precedes it.	Nya la, le nyateƒe me la, enye nusianu si do ŋgɔ nɛ.
I wanted to be mad at him	Medi be mado dziku ɖe eŋu
I didn’t get close to it.	Nyemete ɖe eŋu o.
He can’t, not in this place.	Mate ŋui o, menye le teƒe sia o.
This book is in good condition.	Agbalẽ sia le nɔnɔme nyui me.
In fact, this is a lie.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia nye alakpa.
I could be anywhere	Mate ŋu anɔ afi sia afi
I prayed this would work	Medo gbe ɖa be esia nawɔ dɔ
This is consistent with.	Esia wɔ ɖeka kple.
It will definitely be a big one.	Anye gã aɖe godoo.
I came to congratulate you.	Meva be mado dzidzɔ na wò.
I shouldn’t do it for you	Mele be mawɔe na wò o
He looked like me.	Edze abe nye ene.
Not exactly .	Menye tututu o .
I enjoyed that moment.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
That just annoys me to death.	Ðeko ema doa dziku nam vaseɖe ku me.
I can go on with my life	Mate ŋu ayi nye agbe dzi
I don’t understand why you did what you did	Nyemese nusita nèwɔ nusi nèwɔ la gɔme o
I really hope you can do it as well	Mele mɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ be àte ŋu awɔe abe alesi wòle ene
I’m not the only one who thinks so	Menye nye ɖeka koe susu nenema o
Now we have a strict rule.	Fifia se sesẽ aɖe le mía si.
But it really doesn’t belong to any time or place.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, menye ɣeyiɣi alo teƒe aɖeke tɔ o.
A few years later, another	Le ƒe ʋɛ aɖewo megbe la, bubu aɖe hã va yi
This will continue for a week at a time.	Esia ayi edzi kwasiɖa ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
So far, none of them have.	Vaseɖe fifia la, wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
But I can’t see any of them.	Gake nyemate ŋu akpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
I just couldn’t stay home, you know	Ðeko nyemete ŋu nɔ aƒeme o, ènya
There was just nothing like it.	Ðeko naneke menɔ anyi si sɔ kplii o.
Is it that it is.	Ðe wònye nenema.
It’s not surprising.	Mewɔ nuku o.
I can’t tell who you are.	Nyemate ŋu anya amesi nènye o.
It was a good month for him too.	Ɣleti nyui aɖee wònye na eya hã.
Didn't do this earlier yesterday.	Mewɔ esia do ŋgɔ etsɔ o.
I don’t really want to be here	Nyemedi ŋutɔŋutɔ be manɔ afisia o
We’ll build your car	Míawɔ wò ʋua
I guess it really doesn’t matter.	Mesusu be le nyateƒe me la, mehiã o.
There is no other word for it.	Nya bubu aɖeke meli na esia o.
He was not one of them.	Menye wo dometɔ ɖekae wònye o.
And he has a nice face.	Eye mo nyui aɖe le eŋu.
However, no one cared.	Ke hã, ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
I am not okay with it.	Nyemele nyuie le eŋu.
I will be waiting on every side	Manɔ lalam le akpa ɖesiaɖe
And of course it didn’t.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
And you can help yourself.	Eye àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I got right to the police.	Meva ɖo kpovitɔwo gbɔ tututu.
I am so tired of this life	Agbe sia te ɖeɖi ŋunye ale gbegbe
I know this machine well	Menya mɔ̃ sia nyuie
I also made them a bit shorter for summer	Mewɔ wo hã wole kpuie vie na dzomeŋɔli
And he is waiting now.	Eye wòle lalam fifia.
Actually, I was expecting it	Le nyateƒe me la, menɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ
We can’t really talk about anything.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu tso naneke ŋu le nyateƒe me o.
I was in a bad mood.	Menɔ nɔnɔme gbegblẽ me.
These times are weekly.	Ɣeyiɣi siawo nye kwasiɖa ɖesiaɖe.
I think that is enough	Mesusu be ema sɔ gbɔ ale gbegbe
But there may be a positive side to this.	Gake ɖewohĩ akpa nyui aɖe anɔ esia ŋu.
I know exactly where he is	Menya afisi tututu wòle
I have nothing to say.	Naneke mele asinye magblɔ o.
I thought someone was sick	Mesusu be ame aɖe dze dɔ
He was a busy man.	Enye ŋutsu si ŋu vovo mele o.

This is just more than enough.	Ðeko esia sɔ gbɔ wu.
I am now ready and able to help	Mele klalo fifia eye mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye
I did the same, but heard nothing	Mewɔ nenema ke, gake nyemese naneke o
I said I would do it for him	Megblɔ be mawɔe nɛ
Stop there, guys.	Dzudzɔ le afima.
No one ever lived who could.	Ame aɖeke menɔ agbe kpɔ si ate ŋui o.

Everything about it was.	Nusianu si ku ɖe eŋu la nɔ.

I was happy for the first time ever	Dzidzɔ nɔ menye zi gbãtɔ kpɔ
I already know where to go	Menya afisi mayi xoxo
I will get us out of this	Maɖe mí le esia me
Maybe this will happen in time.	Ðewohĩ esia ava eme le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe.
There really is no right way.	Le nyateƒe me la, mɔ nyui aɖeke meli o.
They had the alcohol.	Aha la nɔ wo si.
I know how to deal with them	Menya alesi mawɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋui
I will be there soon	Mava nɔ afima kpuie
I also knew that would be good for me	Menya hã, ema anyo nam
A pleasant voice greeted him	Gbe nyui aɖe do gbe nɛ
I didn’t expect him to say that	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be agblɔ nya ma o
I just don’t know what to say	Ðeko nyemenya nya si magblɔ o
He also had the funniest name.	Ŋkɔ si doa dzidzɔ na ame wu la hã nɔ esi.
Take a look at that.	Lé ŋku ɖe nya ma ŋu.
One thing is certain.	Nu ɖekae nye be.
I join them in the process.	Mewɔa ɖeka kple wo.
I want to keep working	Medi be mayi edzi anɔ dɔ wɔm
It’s a good part.	Enye akpa nyui aɖe.

Everyone knows that.	Amesiame nya nya ma.
That’s a lot of fun for him.	Ema dzɔa dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
Come on in, now.	Va ge ɖe eme, fifia.

No one could leave.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu dzo o.
I couldn’t show my face for weeks	Nyemete ŋu ɖe nye mo fia kwasiɖa geɖe o
Again, everything seems to have gone wrong.	Le afisia hã la, edze abe nusianu gblẽ ene.
I came up a little short	Meva kpuie vie
It's too personal.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa.
Not a good day for him either.	Menye ŋkeke nyui aɖeke nɛ hã o.
I needed to work	Ehiã be mawɔ dɔ
He couldn’t get there.	Mete ŋu ɖo afima o.
That’s not a good thing.	Ema menye nu nyui aɖeke o.
There was still plenty of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ anyi.
Thank you for your time.	Akpe na wò ɖe wò ɣeyiɣi ta.
We are just like everyone else.	Míele abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.

It can only be in one place at a time.	Teƒe ɖeka koe wòate ŋu anɔ le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
I tried to explain that we had no money	Medze agbagba aɖe eme be ga aɖeke mele mía si o
I didn’t know this existed	Nyemenya be esia li o
Say a word ‘and’.	Gblɔ nya aɖe si nye ‘kple’.
There was no strategy involved.	Aɖaŋu aɖeke menɔ eme o.
I can’t say more than that	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya geɖe wu ema o

This is all I was waiting for.	Esia koe menɔ lalam.
I just wanted to share this with you.	Ðeko medi be magblɔ nya sia na mi.
I can’t imagine what that must have felt like	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi ema anya ase le eɖokui me le susu me o
I did that pretty much all day.	Mewɔe nenema ŋkeke bliboa kloe.
I might have another reason	Susu bubu ate ŋu anɔ asinye
Unlike his previous places.	To vovo na teƒe siwo wònɔ tsã.

I think that says it all	Mesusu be emae gblɔ nya sia katã
These men didn’t care about him.	Ŋutsu siawo metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ o.
He couldn’t control it.	Mete ŋu ɖu edzi o.
He didn't care that much about that.	Metsɔ ɖeke le nya ma me nenema gbegbe o.
Nothing seems to stay in place here.	Edze abe naneke metsi teƒe si wòle le afisia o ene.
I was alone here nearly two hours earlier today	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ afisia gaƒoƒo eve kloe do ŋgɔ egbea
It makes sense to us.	Susu le eme na mí.
This is probably not true.	Anɔ eme be esia menye nyateƒe o.
But I remembered it	Gake meɖo ŋku edzi
I don’t want to be here	Nyemedi be manɔ afisia o
But maybe they missed us.	Gake ɖewohĩ wo to mía ŋu.
I know what he did to them	Menya nu si wòwɔ ɖe wo ŋu
But there had been a reason.	Gake susu aɖe nɔ anyi tsã.
This is just deeply impressive.	Ðeko esia wɔa dɔ ɖe ame dzi vevie.
A lot came out of there	Nu geɖe do tso afima
It's a rule.	Enye se.
I don’t know what it is	Nyemenya nusi wònye o
I don’t want to be like him	Nyemedi be manɔ abe eya ene o
The work in progress.	Dɔ si le edzi yim.
I surprised myself too	Mewɔ nuku na ɖokuinye hã
And of course, this is true.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, esia nye nyateƒe.
That is too easy to do.	Ema wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe akpa.
I have to deal with this myself	Ele be nye ŋutɔ makpɔ esia gbɔ
I do have a point though.	Nya aɖe le asinye ke hã.
Neither of us said anything.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
But I don’t want to go down that road	Gake nyemedi be mayi mɔ ma dzi o
I wonder what happened to him	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae dzɔ ɖe edzi hã
He is talking through himself.	Ele nu ƒom to eme na eɖokui.

It’s a bad thing.	Nu gbegblẽ aɖee.
Use one of them.	Zã wo dometɔ ɖeka.
I will do this myself.	Nye ŋutɔ mawɔ esia.
I found him after he died	Meke ɖe eŋu le eƒe ku megbe
Imagine this happening.	Bu eŋu kpɔ be esia ava eme.
You know which one.	Ènya wo dometɔ si.
This is easy to follow.	Esia dzi wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe.
This week here, that week there.	Kwasiɖa sia le afisia, kwasiɖa ma le afima.
That was a big deal for me.	Ema nye nu gã aɖe nam.

And it’s not here.	Eye menye le afisia o.
I tried to get things done	Medze agbagba be mawɔ nuwo

But other than that, you’re doing fine.	Gake ne menye nenema o la, èle edzi dzem nyuie.
I would rather be happy.	Anyo nam wu be manɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm.
I gave them some of my voice	Metsɔ nye gbe aɖewo na wo
This is very difficult.	Esia sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I want every part of you	Medi wò akpa ɖesiaɖe
If anything, his reputation has improved.	Ne nane li la, ke ŋkɔ nyui si le eŋu la nyo ɖe edzi.
To surprise him.	Be wòawɔ nuku nɛ.
I lived there two years ago	Menɔ afima ƒe eve enye sia

Tell me more about this man.	Gblɔ nu geɖe nam tso ŋutsu sia ŋu.
Please come to us at once.	Taflatse va mía gbɔ zi ɖeka.

A week too long for my man	Kwasiɖa ɖeka didi akpa na nye ŋutsu
It was a great thing.	Nu gã aɖee wònye.
It seemed like a good plan.	Edze abe ɖoɖo nyui aɖee wònye ene.
He wasn't going to take that back.	Menye ɖe wònɔ ema xɔ ge ake o.
But they have to come a long way from last year.	Gake ele be woawɔ nu didi aɖe tso ƒe si va yi gbɔ.
Someone has to be there.	Ele be ame aɖe nanɔ afima.
I must have lost my mind	Nye susu anya bu
But that’s only part of it.	Gake eƒe akpa aɖe koe nye ema.
He could never do that.	Mate ŋu awɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
Someone is talking to him.	Ame aɖe le nu ƒom kplii.
Keep one thought in mind.	Na susu ɖeka nanɔ susu me na wò.
I just can't say enough about this place	Ðeko nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya si sɔ tso teƒe sia ŋu o

I hope you enjoyed it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be edzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ.
I think that’s a great point	Mesusu be nya gã aɖee nye ema
He couldn’t face the truth.	Mete ŋu dze ŋgɔ nyateƒea o.
I trust him with my life	Meka ɖe edzi kple nye agbe
Everything was the same and he couldn’t feel anything on her face.	Nusianu nɔ abe ɖeka ene eye mete ŋu se naneke le mo nɛ o.
I can only imagine what it was like for him.	Ðeko mate ŋu akpɔ alesi wònɔ nɛ le susu me.
I don’t know where they are, or if they are.	Nyemenya afi si wole, alo ne wole hã o.
That sounds like an interesting project.	Ema ɖi dɔ si doa dzidzɔ na ame.
His people are from here.	Eƒe amewo tso afisia.
I was curious to know.	Medi vevie be manya.

A little small, but it did the job	Sue vie, gake ewɔ dɔa
Book in advance.	Agbalẽ do ŋgɔ.

There is very little air.	Ya sue aɖe koe le afima.

Nothing looked like that to me.	Naneke medze nam nenema o.
But only a few weeks ago.	Gake kwasiɖa ʋɛ aɖewo koe nye esia.
It will benefit your ear.	Aɖe vi na wò to.
Let this person be independent.	Ame sia nanɔ eɖokui si.
I know exactly who he is	Menya amesi tututu wònye
But he could not let go of the gun.	Gake mete ŋu ɖe asi le tu la ŋu o.
I want to see where he is.	Medi be makpɔ afisi wòle.
I can’t control it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖu edzi o.

There are two reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae.
Something is on your feet.	Nane le wò afɔ dzi.
I'll just be fine	Ðeko manɔ nyuie
What he was and what he did.	Nusi wònye kple nusi wòwɔ.
He wasn't really expecting to see anything.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ be yeakpɔ naneke o.
I don’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele asinye o.
But two things are clear	Gake nu eve aɖewo me kɔ nyuie
It looks like a mountain.	Edze abe to ene.

This is probably true.	Anɔ eme be nya sia nye nyateƒe.
They’re doing everything right.	Wole nusianu wɔm nyuie.
I know what it’s like.	Menya ale si wòle.
I wasn’t in a hurry	Menye ɖe menɔ du dzi o
And that’s a good thing for him.	Eye ema nye nu nyui aɖe nɛ.
I don’t want to sit at home and do nothing.	Nyemedi be manɔ anyi ɖe aƒeme mawɔ naneke o.
He is not doing this for you.	Menye esia wɔm wòle na wò o.
Many people are not.	Ame geɖe mele nenema o.
I can give you his name	Mate ŋu ana eƒe ŋkɔ na wò
I just need to talk to you about something	Ðeko wòle be maƒo nu tso nane ŋu na wò
This house is very small.	Aƒe sia le sue ŋutɔ.
And many have already done so.	Eye ame geɖe wɔe xoxo.
He's just doing what everyone else we are here.	Ðeko wòle nusi ame bubu ɖesiaɖe míenye le afisia la wɔm.
But he didn’t do that.	Gake mewɔe nenema o.
Many people died.	Ame geɖe ku.
Just because it was easy.	Esi wònɔ bɔbɔe ta ko.
For the sake of the project.	Le dɔa ta.
We know the truth.	Míenya nyateƒea.

He had never seen anything like it.	Mekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
I haven’t heard anything out of the ordinary	Nyemese nya aɖeke si to vovo kura o
Finally, his voice was long.	Mlɔeba la, eƒe gbe didi.
Thanks again for everything.	Akpe ake ɖe nusianu ta.
You had no strings at all.	Ka aɖeke menɔ ŋuwò kura o.
This is something I want, and not in a good way.	Esia nye nane si dim, eye menye le mɔ nyui aɖe nu o.
A very interesting point.	Nya aɖe si doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
What is a city.	Nukae nye du.
It will continue to exist.	Ayi edzi anɔ anyi.
I think you know that too.	Mesusu be wò hã ènya ema.

I really need to talk to you about some things	Ehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ be maƒo nu tso nu aɖewo ŋu na wò
Everyone turned to them.	Amesiame trɔ ɖe wo ŋu.
Man, are they listening.	Ŋutsu, ɖe wole nu tom.
I couldn’t understand with him	Nyemete ŋu se nu gɔme kplii o
He was a great guy.	Enye ŋutsu gã aɖe.
Your people will do anything for you.	Wò amewo awɔ nu sia nu na wò.
I couldn’t have gotten this far without your help	Nyemate ŋu aɖo afisia alea wò kpekpeɖeŋu manɔmee o
This trend could continue over the next few days.	Nɔnɔme sia ate ŋu ayi edzi le ŋkeke ʋɛ siwo gbɔna me.
I just wanted to stay home	Ðeko medi be manɔ aƒeme
In many cases, however, it may not.	Gake le go geɖe me la, ɖewohĩ manɔ nenema o.
But it must have happened.	Gake anya dzɔ.
I was able to save him twice	Mete ŋu xɔ nɛ zi eve
I can’t go further than that	Nyemate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu ema o
This is also easy.	Esia hã le bɔbɔe.
I have to meet you here tomorrow	Ele be mado go wò le afisia etsɔ
I let him, happy to accept him too.	Meɖe mɔ nɛ, kple dzidzɔ be mexɔ eya hã.
There wasn’t much space.	Teƒe geɖe menɔ afima o.

I can’t speak more.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu geɖe wu o.
I had to try this.	Ele nam be mate esia kpɔ.
There is no time limit.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli o.
I was looking for myself	Menɔ ɖokuinye dim
However doing so can be very expensive.	Ke hã esia wɔwɔ ate ŋu axɔ ga geɖe ŋutɔ.
It was a ship.	Meli aɖee wònye.
I felt very unhappy	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ kura o
He was a good guy, through and through.	Enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe, to eme kple to eme.
However, he didn’t.	Ke hã, mewɔe nenema o.
The result will surprise you.	Nusi ado tso eme la awɔ nuku na wò.
Very few people approached me.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe te ɖe ŋunye.
It can be great.	Ate ŋu anye gã.
I really don’t know how people can do it hourly.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya alesi amewo ate ŋu awɔe gaƒoƒo ɖesiaɖe o.
I wish I knew them better	Anyo nam be menya wo nyuie wu
I stayed behind to secure this place here	Metsi megbe be makpɔ teƒe sia ta le afisia
I hope today is at least a little bit better.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be egbea nyo vie ya teti.
I was like him.	Menɔ abe eya ene.
It has happened so many times.	Edzɔ zi geɖe ale gbegbe.
But that would be too soon.	Gake ema anye kaba akpa.
I tried once.	Mete kpɔ zi ɖeka.
I couldn’t have done it myself if it wasn’t for this leg.	Nye ŋutɔ mate ŋu awɔe ne menye afɔ sia tae o.
You can get a blood transfusion.	Àte ŋu ado ʋu na wò.
He would never have allowed it	Anye ne maɖe mɔ ɖe eŋu gbeɖe o
I am, and I am always here	Mele, eye mele afisia ɣesiaɣi
But we should have done something like this.	Gake ɖe wòle be míawɔ nane si le abe esia ene hafi.
I have no reason to be tired	Susu aɖeke meli si tae ɖeɖi te ŋunye o
I understand his reasons for doing this	Mese susu siwo tae wòwɔ esia ɖo la gɔme

And well it is working.	Eye nyuie ele dɔ wɔm.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It seems to have worked time and time again	Edze abe ewɔ dɔ zi gbɔ zi geɖe ene
That was too bad for him.	Ema gblẽ nu le eŋu akpa.

It had no head.	Ta aɖeke menɔ eŋu o.
I thought it was amazing.	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Now that's weird.	Fifia ema nye nusi mewɔ nuku o.
I would have to do it.	Anye ne ele be mawɔe.
Good thing, that is.	Nu nyui, si fia be.
Everything moved in the wrong direction.	Nusianu ʋu yi mɔ gbegblẽ nu.
He didn’t see any anger.	Mekpɔ dziku aɖeke o.
Someone according to my own heart	Ame aɖe le nye ŋutɔ nye dzi nu
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There had never been anything quite like it.	Naneke menɔ anyi si sɔ kple esia tututu kpɔ o.
I was amazed at what he did	Nusi wòwɔ la wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
It’s just an idea that’s always there.	Susu aɖe si nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi koe wònye.
I can’t tell you what he did there	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi wòwɔ le afima na mi o
He was such a great guy.	Enye ŋutsu gã aɖe alea gbegbe.
Everyone knows if that’s true.	Amesiame nya nenye be nya ma nye nyateƒe.
But how do I do this?.	Gake aleke mawɔ esia?.
I need to talk to someone	Ele be maƒo nu kple ame aɖe
There has to be a reason.	Ele be susu aɖe nanɔ anyi.
There is nothing we can do for the people there.	Naneke meli míate ŋu awɔ na ame siwo le afi ma o.
I had nothing to say.	Nya aɖeke menɔ asinye magblɔ o.
Not surprising, but still.	Mewɔ nuku o, gake kokoko.
Please stay here.	Taflatse nɔ afisia.

Come to my place.	Va nye teƒe.

He couldn’t leave.	Mete ŋu dzo o.
I will be patient with things.	Mado dzi le nuwo me.
I am going to think about it.	Mele eŋu bu ge le eŋu.
No one did anything.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ naneke o.
I remember when he did that to me	Meɖo ŋku esime wòwɔ nu ma nam
We are not together.	Míele ɖekae o.
I know and it doesn’t matter	Menya eye mehiã o
He didn’t get that.	Mexɔ ema o.
And it will help a lot of people, in a lot of ways.	Eye akpe ɖe ame geɖe ŋu, le mɔ geɖe nu.
I wasn’t sure what to say either	Nye hã nyemeka ɖe nya si magblɔ dzi o
I can’t hear well here	Nyemate ŋu ase nu nyuie le afisia o
It was a difficult time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe.
He should have done the job much earlier.	Ðe wòle be wòawɔ dɔa do ŋgɔ kura hafi.
I let myself go.	Meɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu.
I think behind the scenes at least, probably.	Mesusu be le megbe na ya teti la, anɔ eme.
I would have said more.	Anye ne magblɔ nya geɖe wu hafi.
I built this mansion	Nyee tu xɔ gã sia
You can tell that in the room	Àte ŋu anya ema le xɔa me
He didn’t want me to come.	Medi be mava o.
It’s too big a job.	Enye dɔ gã aɖe akpa.
He knew nothing more.	Menya naneke wu ema o.
Again, it’s just a matter of time.	Le afisia hã la, ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
It wouldn’t work very well for anyone else.	Mawɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ na ame bubu aɖeke o.

He is doing well.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie.
I didn’t hear anything.	Nyemese naneke o.

He needed one just to walk a few steps.	Ehiã ɖeka be wòate ŋu azɔ afɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ko.
He didn’t care about me.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam o.
I needed something to remind me	Mehiã nane si aɖo ŋku edzi nam
He wasn’t worried.	Metsi dzi o.
I wanted to stay.	Medi be manɔ anyi.

This is really for them.	Esia nye na wo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That’s what this is about.	Emae nye nusi ŋu nya sia ku ɖo.

There was no room for error.	Vodada ƒe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.

I was very hot.	Mexɔ dzo ŋutɔ.
I was so mad at you that morning	Medo dziku ɖe ŋuwò ale gbegbe ŋdi ma

He doesn’t do it every time you want him to.	Mewɔa esia ɣesiaɣi si nèdi o.

There has to be a good point somewhere.	Ele be nya nyui aɖe nanɔ afi aɖe.
It’s small, but comfortable.	Ele sue, gake eƒe dzi dze eme.
And he liked it.	Eye edzɔ dzi nɛ.

Live one day, and part of a day, at a time.	Nɔ agbe ŋkeke ɖeka, kple ŋkeke ɖeka ƒe akpa aɖe, le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.

Treat him kindly.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu nyuie.

And no one can find it.	Eye ame aɖeke mate ŋu ake ɖe eŋu o.

I can’t remember ever telling her my real name	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi be megblɔ nye ŋkɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ nɛ kpɔ o

Or maybe someone completely different.	Alo ɖewohĩ ame aɖe si to vovo kura.

Someone said something, someone answered.	Ame aɖe gblɔ nya aɖe, ame aɖe ɖo eŋu.

I don’t know whether to be angry or happy	Nyemenya nenye be mado dziku loo alo makpɔ dzidzɔ o
In fact, you will be surprised.	Le nyateƒe me la, awɔ nuku na wò.
And that’s a problem.	Eye ema nye kuxi aɖe.
Think about it for a moment.	Bu eŋu vie.
I doubt it very much though	Meke ɖi le eŋu ŋutɔ gake
I want to do a good job	Medi be mawɔ dɔ nyuie
I could really do anything	Mete ŋu wɔa nusianu ŋutɔŋutɔ
A good fit is better	Nusi sɔ nyuie nyo wu
But he didn’t find any.	Gake mekpɔ ɖeke o.
I should have expected this	Ðe wòle be makpɔ mɔ na esia hafi
But the reality had been overwhelming.	Gake nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si nɔ edzi yim la xɔ aƒe ɖe amewo me tsã.
It doesn’t make much sense to me.	Susu aɖeke mele eme nam boo o.
Treat them differently.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu le mɔ bubu nu.
I feel very strongly about that	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ŋutɔ le ema ŋu
I know exactly where we are right now	Menya afi si tututu míele fifia
I only deal with people	Amewo koe mewɔa nu kplii
That would be really weird.	Ema anye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I hope next year is good for them	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ƒe si gbɔna anyo na wo
You can’t win.	Màte ŋu aɖu dzi o.

That’s kind of old.	Ema nye xoxo aɖe ƒomevi.

I think a lot of people are tired	Mesusu be ɖeɖi te ame geɖe ŋu
But it doesn’t work.	Gake mewɔa dɔ o.
He was glad she liked it.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ be edzɔ dzi nɛ.
I could never see myself with anyone else	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye kple ame bubu aɖeke gbeɖe o
Not in our house.	Menye le míaƒe aƒeme o.
At least one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka ya teti.
I stood in the pit, panicking	Metsi tre ɖe doa me, eye metsi dzodzodzoe
I was able to survive, because of them	Mete ŋu tsi agbe, le wo ta
This much is true.	Esia sɔ gbɔ nye nyateƒe.
That’s why they’re doing that.	Esia tae wole nu ma wɔm ɖo.
I hope he feels the same way	Mele mɔ kpɔm be eya hã ase le eɖokui me nenema
It may be that way.	Ate ŋu anɔ nenema.
We never know exactly what they will do.	Míenya nu si tututu woawɔ gbeɖe o.
I am not yet ready to draw that conclusion.	Nyemele klalo haɖe be maƒo nya ta nenema o.
And in the afternoon, too.	Eye ŋdɔ me hã.
I found a horse!! 	Mekpɔ sɔ aɖe!!
I headed to his house	Meɖo ta eƒe aƒeme
We have to follow that rule.	Ele be míawɔ ɖe se ma dzi.

I know he would love to see you	Menya be adzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ be yeakpɔ wò
I think you would have liked them.	Mesusu be wo adzɔ dzi na wò hafi.
I had to get close to everyone	Ele be mate ɖe amesiame ŋu
You can do it too, you know.	Àte ŋu awɔe hã, ènya.
I just have to keep fighting	Ðeko wòle be mayi edzi anɔ avu wɔm
I am not sure where the house is	Nyemeka ɖe afi si aƒea le dzi o
It was an incredible moment.	Enye ɣeyiɣi si mexɔ se o.
That doesn’t explain everything.	Ema meɖe nusianu me o.
These thoughts are his own.	Susu siawo nye eya ŋutɔ tɔ.
I didn’t know it would come to this	Nyemenya be ava ɖo esia gbɔ o
I was the one doing the wrong thing	Nyee nye ame si nɔ nu gbegblẽ wɔm

Everything seemed fine.	Edze abe nuwo katã nyo ene.

Not a good one, a great one.	Menye nyui aɖeke o, gã aɖee.

Two people can end up using each other.	Ame eve ate ŋu ava zã wo nɔewo mlɔeba.
I really need to talk to you	Ehiã be maƒo nu kpli wò ŋutɔŋutɔ
This was very upsetting to me.	Esia te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t stand it now	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu fifia o
I’m glad he’s here.	Edzɔ dzi nam be ele afisia.
I was very surprised and impressed	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ eye wòwɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
But he didn’t give her one.	Gake metsɔ ɖeka nɛ o.
I really have to deal with this	Ele nam ŋutɔŋutɔ be makpɔ esia gbɔ
Not at this hour.	Menye le gaƒoƒo sia me o.
It will be true.	Anye nyateƒe.
I can’t handle this	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ o
I didn’t know it could be like that between us.	Nyemenya be ate ŋu anɔ alea le mía dome o.
Maybe I could have saved them	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu aɖe wo hafi
I tried to be useful.	Medze agbagba be maɖe vi nam.
I can’t tell him that yet	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma nɛ haɖe o
He never expected the truth.	Mekpɔ mɔ na nyateƒea kpɔ o.
I decided to call him and talk about it	Meɖoe be maƒo ka nɛ aƒo nu tso eŋu
I never wanted him more	Nyemedi nɛ wu ema gbeɖe o
A good man, with a heart	Ame nyui, si si dzi le

I promised to stay with the car	Medo ŋugbe be manɔ ʋua gbɔ
At this time of the year.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
This is going to happen.	Esia le edzi yim.
I have seen this before	Mekpɔ esia do ŋgɔ
I can’t tell you how much that helped me	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ alesi gbegbe ema kpe ɖe ŋunye la na wò o
I tried a few things to no avail.	Mete nu ʋɛ aɖewo kpɔ gake medze edzi o.

I didn’t mind getting wet	Meɖe fu nam be maƒo tsi o
If only he could talk.	Ne ɖe wòate ŋu aƒo nu ko hafi.
He could have helped her.	Ate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu hafi.
He wasn't that tired.	Menye ɖeɖi te eŋu nenema gbegbe o.
I didn't have time to react	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye mawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu o
I wanted his tongue in my mouth	Medi be eƒe aɖe nanɔ nye nu me
He would never get to do anything or go anywhere.	Makpɔ mɔ awɔ naneke alo ayi afi aɖeke gbeɖe o.
I wonder why he was here last night	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae wònɔ afisia le zã si va yi me hã
That’s a very good thing.	Ema nyo ŋutɔ.
I need to pray more often	Ele be mado gbe ɖa zi geɖe wu
If he is interested.	Nenye be etsɔ ɖe le eme.
I am not sure of anything	Nyemeka ɖe naneke dzi o
I have some really good ideas, too	Susu nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖewo le asinye, nye hã
I do that all summer anyway	Mewɔa ema le dzomeŋɔli bliboa me le mɔ sia mɔ nu
I couldn’t get myself a car to look for them	Nyemete ŋu na ɖokuinye ʋu be madi wo o
The same problem remains.	Kuxi ma ke gakpɔtɔ li.
I was talking about me	Menɔ nu ƒom tso ŋunye
You can’t be that.	Màte ŋu anye nenema o.
He was very caring.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme na ame ŋutɔ.
I have to do it for you	Ele nam be mawɔe na wò
There is no characteristic.	Nɔnɔme aɖeke meli o.
I wasn’t that surprised.	Mewɔ nuku nam nenema gbegbe o.
Let’s unite together.	Mina míawɔ ɖeka ɖekae.
The police are there.	Kpovitɔwo le afima.
Not now, not tonight.	Menye fifia o, menye le zã sia me o.
Now he won’t do it for her.	Fifia mawɔe nɛ o.
This is a must!.	Esia nye nusi wòle be woawɔ!.
I hope he is enjoying himself	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ele dzidzɔ kpɔm
But this may not be easy.	Gake ɖewohĩ esia manɔ bɔbɔe o.
I ended up with the same result.	Meva kpɔ nu ma ke si do tso eme.
I was almost certain of it anyway	Meka ɖe edzi kloe le mɔ sia mɔ nu
But he has never been able to do this.	Gake mete ŋu wɔ esia kpɔ o.
It is, in fact, unpleasant.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye nusi medze ame ŋu o.
Look at this guy.	Kpɔ ŋutsu sia ɖa.
It’s been a tough year for all of us.	Ƒe sesẽ aɖee wònye na mí katã.
I wondered what that would look like	Mebia ɖokuinye be aleke ema ava nɔ hã
I couldn’t finish it	Nyemete ŋu wu enu o
It’s not such a big deal, per se.	Menye nya gã aɖeke nenema gbegbe o, le eɖokui si.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I was a little angry	Medo dziku vie
I hope he is enjoying himself	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ele dzidzɔ kpɔm
It is real, it is here, and it is alive now.	Enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ, ele afisia, eye wòle agbe fifia.
This was very appealing to him.	Esia dze eŋu ŋutɔ.
Something only you can do.	Nane si wò ɖeka koe ate ŋu awɔ.
And only one person was missing.	Eye ame ɖeka koe bu.
What if you are tired.	Ke ne ɖeɖi te ŋuwò ya ɖe.
He wasn’t sure he could.	Meka ɖe edzi be yeate ŋui o.
But no one could leave.	Gake ame aɖeke mete ŋu dzo o.
I’ve done it twice before myself	Mewɔe zi eve do ŋgɔ na ɖokuinye
I said this would be good	Megblɔ be esia anyo
In the head.	Le ta me.
The first is the first.	Gbãtɔ nye gbãtɔ.
I hope the king can help	Mele mɔ kpɔm be fia la ate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu
There is nothing I don’t know.	Naneke meli si menya o.
I have to be happy	Ele be makpɔ dzidzɔ
I have never seen this before.	Nyemekpɔ esia kpɔ o.
Often, over and over again	Zi geɖe la, zi gbɔ zi geɖe
That chapter of my life is now finally over.	Nye agbe ƒe ta ma wu enu mlɔeba azɔ.
But there was a lot of downside.	Gake nu gbegblẽ geɖe nɔ anyi.
I’m not having trouble finding a job.	Menye dɔ didi mele fu ɖem nam o.
But I’m still not sure now.	Gake nyemeka ɖe edzi kokoko fifia o.
That says against you.	Ema gblɔ tsi tre ɖe ŋuwò.
I had already decided to go	Meɖoe xoxo be mayi
I didn’t see you there	Nyemekpɔ wò le afima o
I was worried about everything	Metsi dzi ɖe nusianu ŋu
I can do anything he can do.	Mate ŋu awɔ nusianu si wòate ŋu awɔ.
I want to protect you all	Medi be makpɔ mi katã ta
I understand it better than my own home	Mese egɔme nyuie wu nye ŋutɔ nye aƒe
That's anyo.	Ema anyo.
I needed to know more, so much more	Ehiã be manya nu geɖe wu, nu geɖe ŋutɔ
Many people are against it	Ame geɖe tsi tre ɖe eŋu
But there is no joy.	Gake dzidzɔ aɖeke meli o.
This time seems to be different.	Edze abe ɣeyiɣi sia to vovo ene.
I know you can’t do that	Menya be màte ŋu awɔ ema o
No one wants them.	Ame aɖeke medi wo o.
This is a mischaracterization of a situation.	Esia nye nɔnɔme aɖe ƒe nɔnɔme gbegblẽ.
And yet, so much happened, so much suffered.	Eye ke hã, nu geɖe ŋutɔ dzɔ, nu geɖe ŋutɔ kpe fu.
A small, intact spot caught my eye	Teƒe sue aɖe si me gblẽ o la lé nye ŋku
It can take an hour or more.	Ate ŋu axɔ gaƒoƒo ɖeka alo esi wu nenema.
Let me just get this out.	Mina maɖe esia ɖa ko.
His mouth turned down.	Eƒe nu trɔ ɖe anyi.
Each turned to think about himself.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe trɔ ɖe eɖokui ŋu bubu.
I know you don’t know where he is	Menya be mènya afi si wòle o
I had to find out for myself	Ele be nye ŋutɔ mava nya nu tso eŋu
Everything fits him.	Nusianu sɔ ɖe edzi.
But it’s not any good.	Gake menye nyui aɖeke o.
I was there for so long	Menɔ afima ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ale gbegbe
Do what you have to do, for you.	Wɔ nusi wòle be nàwɔ, na wò.
I am not pleading for his life	Menye ɖe mele kuku ɖem ɖe eƒe agbe ta o
No one else really knew what was going on there.	Ame bubu aɖeke menya nusi nɔ edzi yim le afima ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
None of them work well.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔa dɔ nyuie o.
I can tell him anything and everything	Mate ŋu agblɔ nusianu kple nusianu nɛ
We can certainly do it here.	Míate ŋu awɔe le afisia godoo.
He had obviously lost everything.	Edze ƒã be nusianu bu nɛ.
I was impressed, actually	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me
I can be anything.	Mate ŋu anye nusianu.
Place.	Teƒe.
That’s the only right word.	Eya koe nye nya si sɔ.
He didn’t do too well with it.	Mewɔe nyuie akpa le eŋu o.
He had never looked into any of them.	Mekpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke me kpɔ o.
It was something else he was looking for.	Enye nu bubu aɖe si dim wònɔ.
I had heard that name before.	Mese ŋkɔ ma do ŋgɔ.
It looks very good.	Edze nyuie ŋutɔ.
That’s enough, believe me.	Ema sɔ gbɔ, xɔ dzinye se.
I tried for almost an hour before giving up	Medze agbagba gaƒoƒo ɖeka kloe hafi na ta
Everyone is involved.	Amesiame le eme.
I have to stay with them	Ele be manɔ wo gbɔ
But he was satisfied.	Gake eƒe dzi dze eme.
I am the only reason you live.	Nye ɖeka koe nye nu si ta nèle agbe ɖo.
Everyone was so focused on each other today.	Amesiame ƒe susu nɔ wo nɔewo ŋu ale gbegbe egbea.
Nothing could be more false.	Naneke mate ŋu anye alakpa wu ema o.
Yet none of it is true.	Ke hã wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
But you’re not in the clear yet.	Gake mèle nusi me kɔ la me haɖe o.
I've actually done this before with little trouble	Mewɔ esia ŋutɔŋutɔ do ŋgɔ eye kuxi boo aɖeke menɔ ŋunye o
If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu la, adzɔ dzi na mí ŋutɔ.
A car has just pulled up	Ðeko ʋu aɖe tu teti koe nye ema
Go back earlier.	Trɔ yi megbe do ŋgɔ.
I really hope this goes somewhere	Mele mɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ be esia ayi afi aɖe
I wanted him to have a place	Medi be teƒe aɖe nanɔ esi
I need to talk to someone.	Ele be maƒo nu kple ame aɖe.
He is no longer there.	Megale afima o.
But I was tired	Gake ɖeɖi te ŋunye
I have many children	Vi geɖe le asinye
I’m not sure what’s right.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi sɔ dzi o.
You don’t know what’s wrong.	Mènya nusi gblẽ o.
I just got sick of it	Ðeko medze dɔ le eŋu
In fact, they are very far apart.	Le nyateƒe me la, wo dome didi tso wo nɔewo gbɔ ŋutɔ.
This is the opposite of that.	Esia to vovo na ema.
It doesn’t matter.	Mehiã o.
No one seems to be in the room.	Edze abe ame aɖeke mele xɔa me o ene.
Not a long time ago.	Menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia o.
I thought the night was over	Mesusu be zã la wu enu
Some positive things have also happened.	Nu nyui aɖewo hã do mo ɖa.
I’ve never seen anything like it	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o
It needs more.	Ehiã geɖe wu.
I just don’t know.	Ðeko nyemenya o.
I never had to do it	Mehiã be mawɔe kpɔ o
There was a respect for him that had escaped me in the past.	Bubu aɖe nɔ eŋu si si le menye va yi.
In some cases, that may be what they want.	Le go aɖewo me la, ɖewohĩ emae nye nusi dim wole.
Actually, I was only able to go for one day.	Le nyateƒe me la, ŋkeke ɖeka koe mete ŋu yi.
I can’t remember when.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku ɣekaɣie dzi o.
That didn’t please him.	Ema medze eŋu o.
That is the attitude.	Emae nye nɔnɔme si le ame si.
That is not true at all.	Ema menye nyateƒe kura o.
This didn’t work out	Esia medze edzi o
This is some good stuff.	Esia nye nu nyui aɖewo.
But this only works once.	Gake zi ɖeka koe esia wɔa dɔ.
I can’t get enough of it.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ eƒe akpa si sɔ gbɔ akpa o.
Not much just yet.	Menye nu geɖe fifia koe o.
I decided to impress them.	Meɖoe be mawɔ dɔ ɖe wo dzi.
His hand automatically threw away the non-existent rope.	Eƒe asi tsɔ ka si meli o la ƒu gbe le eɖokui si.
There is nothing surprising about this.	Naneke mewɔ nuku le esia me o.
Anything seemed possible for him now.	Edze abe nusianu anya wɔ nɛ fifia ene.
I have no idea what it could be	Nyemenya nusi wòate ŋu anye o
I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
I just want things to work.	Medi be nuwo nawɔ dɔ ko.
I don’t have to deal with that yet	Mehiã be makpɔ ema gbɔ haɖe o
But, that’s life.	Gake, emae nye agbe.
But it is impossible.	Gake manya wɔ o.
It’s unclear if he’s talking to her.	Me me kɔ nenye be ele nu ƒom nɛ o.
I know nothing about this problem.	Nyemenya naneke tso kuxi sia ŋu o.
But he would never, ever make a mistake with me.	Gake mawɔ vodada le ŋunye gbeɖe o, gbeɖe o.
I don’t know what came over me	Nyemenya nusi va to dzinye o
Many times, many people finished	Zi geɖe la, ame geɖe wu enu
None of them are great.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menye gã o.

He has that kind of thing.	Nu ma ƒomevi le esi.
Like so many times before.	Abe alesi wònɔ zi geɖe va yi ene.
I was hoping this day would never come	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be ŋkeke sia mava gbeɖe o
No one was in the room, yet everyone was inside.	Ame aɖeke menɔ xɔa me o, ke hã amesiame nɔ eme.
I started this morning	Medze egɔme ŋdi sia
He doesn't exist now.	Meli fifia o.
He never introduced anyone	Meɖe ame aɖeke fia gbeɖe o
I am very short.	Nyee le kpuie ŋutɔ.
I saw more than enough to relax	Mekpɔ nu geɖe wu esi sɔ gbɔ be maɖe dzi ɖi
I don’t expect this from anyone.	Nyemele mɔ kpɔm na esia tso ame aɖeke gbɔ o.
I just had to get out	Ðeko wòle be mado go
After several days, I finally figured out how to do it.	Le ŋkeke geɖe megbe la, meva ke ɖe alesi mawɔe ŋu mlɔeba.
He was focused on it.	Eƒe susu nɔ eŋu.
I needed a job and I’m still working	Mehiã dɔ eye megale dɔ wɔm kokoko
There might be a good reason.	Ðewohĩ susu nyui aɖe anɔ anyi.
But this is a possibility	Gake esia ate ŋu adzɔ
There.	Afi ma.
I don’t want it to work, you know.	Nyemedi be wòawɔ dɔ o, ènya.
I just had to get out of there.	Ðeko wòle be mado le afima.
I want to live a little	Medi be manɔ agbe vie
Everything is working fine.	Nusianu le dɔ wɔm nyuie.
I was only able to save two lives	Ame eve ƒe agbe koe mete ŋu ɖe
We can do that.	Míate ŋu awɔ ema.
I need to know what it looks like.	Ele be manya ale si wòle.
I didn’t know what to do before	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tsã o
I just can’t do it.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe ko o.
He put his hand on her leg.	Etsɔ asi ɖo eƒe afɔ dzi.
I only have one thing and two hands	Nu ɖeka kple asi eve koe le asinye
I could feel the atmosphere between them change	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me be nɔnɔme si le wo dome la trɔ
But nothing seems to be working.	Gake edze abe naneke mele dɔ wɔm o ene.
The highway has remained the same since that day	Mɔ gã la gakpɔtɔ le nenema tso ŋkeke ma dzi
That is very difficult.	Ema sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I didn’t know he was going to call you	Nyemenya be ele ka ƒo ge na wò o

And so did he.	Eye eya hã.
I can easily understand that	Mate ŋu ase nya ma gɔme bɔbɔe
Trust me, its great.	Ka ɖe dzinye, eƒe gã.
I can stay a little longer	Mate ŋu anɔ anyi vie
I don’t have to come and join them	Mehiã be mava kpe ɖe wo ŋu o
I seemed to feel it	Edze abe mese le ɖokuinye me ene
He can’t do it alone.	Eya ɖeka mate ŋu awɔe o.
They had four children.	Vi ene nɔ wo si.
I can move forward now.	Mate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ fifia.
Everyone is here.	Amesiame le afisia.
I lost my job because of it.	Nye dɔ ge le asinye le esia ta.
I can’t talk about it	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu tso eŋu o
But that changed about four hours ago.	Gake ema trɔ abe gaƒoƒo ene enye sia ene.
I don’t know them myself	Nye ŋutɔ nyemenya wo o
I can’t believe all that has happened	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nu siwo katã dzɔ la dzi ase o
It has never been like that.	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o.

I don’t know what else to do	Nyemenya nu bubu si mawɔ o
I know this place.	Menya teƒe sia.
But not already.	Gake menye xoxo o.
I knew this was just one night	Menya be zã ɖeka koe esia nye
That was very appealing to him.	Ema dzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I finally shook hands with him	Meva lé asi kplii mlɔeba
I will be that person.	Nyee anye ame ma.
I think everyone did that	Mesusu be amesiame wɔe nenema
I wanted to know what was going through his mind	Medi be manya nu si nɔ eƒe susu me tom
Everyone can live with that.	Amesiame ate ŋu anɔ agbe kple ema.
I felt calm and comfortable here	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme eye nye dzi dze eme le afisia
That possibility did not excite him at all.	Nusi ate ŋu adzɔ ma medo dzidzɔ nɛ kura o.
But there was no room for that.	Gake teƒe aɖeke menɔ anyi na ema o.
For a small fee.	Le fe sue aɖe ta.
There is nothing but me.	Naneke meli wu nye o.
I would do anything for that little face.	Mawɔ nusianu ɖe ​​mo sue ma ta.
I'd rather be at home.	Anyo nam wu le aƒeme.
I have to explain that as well	Ele be maɖe ema hã me
This book takes a first step in that direction.	Agbalẽ sia ɖe afɔ gbãtɔ le mɔ ma nu.
Let’s do another one.	Mina míawɔ bubu.
I knew that would be just as deadly	Menya be ema hã awu ame nenema ke
That happened to a very small extent.	Ema dzɔ va ɖo afi sue aɖe ko.
I am not like him.	Nyemele abe eya ene o.
I never liked that guy anyway	Ŋutsu ma medze ŋunye kpɔ le mɔ aɖeke nu o
This one doesn’t.	Esia mewɔe nenema o.

He was also pleased.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ hã.

It is no longer working.	Megale dɔ wɔm azɔ o.
Actually, very, very rare.	Le nyateƒe me la, ƒã ŋutɔ, ƒã ŋutɔ.
I could feel that much	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me nenema gbegbe
A great opportunity is at hand	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe tu aƒe
No one would tell me where it was.	Ame aɖeke magblɔ afi si wòle nam o.
It seems simple but somehow it’s not working.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe ene gake le mɔ aɖe nu la, mele dɔ wɔm o.
I started out really strong	Medze egɔme sesĩe ŋutɔŋutɔ
Clearly, that is no longer the case.	Edze ƒã be megale nenema o.
The place beneath his feet remains solid, at least for now.	Teƒe si le eƒe afɔ te la gakpɔtɔ li ke, fifia ya teti.
Things will be great.	Nuwo anyo ŋutɔ.
I don’t know what to do.	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o.
I don’t want anything to do with it	Nyemedi be mawɔ naneke le eŋu o
I am here for another job	Dɔ bubu aɖe tae mele afisia ɖo
Just not for any such appealing reason.	Ðeko menye le susu aɖeke si doa dzidzɔ na ame alea ta o.
There was a lot of anger.	Dziku geɖe do mo ɖa.
I missed you all day wanting to see you	Mesusu wò ŋkeke bliboa katã esi medi be makpɔ wò
I could almost touch it	Mete ŋu ka asi eŋu kloe
I have to get out of here	Ele be mado le afisia
Honestly, this dress can go anywhere.	Le nyateƒe me la, awu sia ate ŋu ayi afi sia afi.
I am the complete opposite	Nyee nye nusi to vovo kura na ema
It had worked well for me.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie nam tsã.
I think that’s amazing	Mesusu be esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
A month or two ago.	Ɣleti alo eve enye sia.
I had brought that home to me.	Metsɔ ema va aƒeme nam kpɔ.
I can’t stand it anymore	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu azɔ o
I don’t want them to do that.	Nyemedi be woawɔ nu ma o.
In this case, the.	Le go sia me la.
On me, at least.	Le dzinye ya teti.
I don’t think it’s that simple.	Nyemesusu be ele bɔbɔe nenema o.
Almost everyone does this.	Amesiame kloe wɔa esia.
I can always look forward to that	Mate ŋu akpɔ mɔ na ema ɣesiaɣi
I’m glad you liked it.	Edzɔ dzi nam be edzɔ dzi na wò.
I think it’s a good idea.	Mesusu be enye susu nyui aɖe.
But it doesn’t work.	Gake mewɔa dɔ o.
I think he would behave differently	Mesusu be awɔ nu le mɔ bubu nu
I would say two would do it.	Magblɔ be ame eve awɔe.
I was in a place that felt familiar	Menɔ teƒe aɖe si mese le ɖokuinye me be menya nyuie
I knew he had a job to do.	Menya be dɔ aɖe le esi wòawɔ.
I knew there was one, but not where	Menya be ɖeka li, gake menye afi kae o
I can’t remember his last name	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ mamlɛtɔ dzi o
So did he, too.	Nenema ke eya hã wɔe.
I was sure things wouldn’t work out	Meka ɖe edzi be nuwo mava yi nyuie o
The same thing can happen.	Ate ŋu adzɔ nenema ke.
It is imperative that I address this tonight	Ele vevie ŋutɔ be makpɔ nya sia gbɔ le zã sia me
My place is there.	Nye teƒe le afima.
I couldn’t see his face clearly.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ eƒe mo nyuie o.
Is that the case.	Ðe wòle nenema.
I don’t want that.	Nyemedi nenema o.
If you have any ideas, it would really help.	Ne susu aɖewo le asiwò la, akpe ɖe ŋuwò ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Let this stay put.	Na esia nanɔ anyi ɖi.
That was the first difficulty.	Emae nye nu sesẽ gbãtɔ.
I can’t understand the reasoning behind it.	Nyemate ŋu ase susu si le megbe nɛ gɔme o.
It was a nice building.	Enye xɔ nyui aɖe.
Nothing else is going on.	Naneke megale edzi yim o.
He didn’t say whose side they were on.	Megblɔ amesi ƒe akpa dzi wole la ƒe nya aɖeke o.
I think he needs someone to take care of him	Mesusu be ehiã ame aɖe si akpɔ edzi
I tried to explain.	Medze agbagba be maɖe eme.
I grew up, and I grew up.	Metsi, eye metsi.
I can’t get rid of it	Nyemate ŋu aɖee o
Not in this city.	Menye le du sia me o.
And he's going to find whoever it is.	Eye ele amesiame si wònye la di ge.
It looked like a rock.	Edze abe kpe aɖe ene.
People are interested, not things.	Amewo tsɔ ɖe le eme, ke menye nuwo me o.
I could never have expected anything like this	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ mɔ na naneke si le abe esia ene gbeɖe o
Our our work is paying off.	Míaƒe míaƒe dɔa le vi ɖem na mí.
I was in a bad place	Menɔ teƒe gbegblẽ aɖe
I knew what he did to me would kill	Menya be nusi wòwɔ ɖe ŋunye la awu ame
I hope it works out well.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ nyuie.
I don’t know what to say to that	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ na nya ma o
I hope, so desperately, for you	Mele mɔ kpɔm, vevie ale gbegbe, na wò
But this will do the job.	Gake esia awɔ dɔa.
I never wanted this life for you	Nyemedi agbe sia na mi kpɔ o
Like yesterday, it would be great.	Abe etsɔ ene la, anyo ŋutɔ.
I do remember the first day of school	Meɖo ŋku suku ƒe ŋkeke gbãtɔ dzi ya
There was no mistake.	Vodada aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I don’t think you’ll come alone	Nyemesusu be wò ɖeka koe ava o
A summer of snow.	Dzomeŋɔli aɖe.
Presently he trotted towards them.	Fifia la, etsɔ afɔ ƒu du yi wo gbɔ.
I think you .	Mesusu be wò .
Interview someone else.	Bia gbe ame bubu.
He made a dead stone.	Ewɔ kpe kuku.
It was a very big deal.	Enye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I had heard of it	Mese nu tso eŋu kpɔ
I knew they were looking for us	Menya be wole mía dim vevie
He's like a big kid.	Ele abe ɖevi gã aɖe ene.
But there was no one, really.	Gake ame aɖeke menɔ anyi o, le nyateƒe me.
I just don’t know where that lands	Nyemenya afi si ema va dze ɖo ko o
Clearly, this is the opposite.	Edze ƒã be esia nye nya si tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
You probably enjoyed it.	Anɔ eme be edzɔ dzi na wò.
I got this one.	Mexɔ esia.
To anyone who will listen.	Na amesiame si aɖo to.
I am a person in my mind.	Menye ame si le susu me nam.
I don’t think he cares	Mesusu be metsɔ ɖeke le eme o
But I couldn’t understand it	Gake nyemete ŋu se egɔme o
I can’t take this anymore	Nyemate ŋu axɔ esia azɔ o
I can’t feel anything else	Nyemate ŋu ase nu bubu aɖeke le ɖokuinye me o
I knew he would have something right	Menya be nane si sɔ anɔ esi
There is none of them.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
The first night didn’t start well.	Zã gbãtɔ medze egɔme nyuie o.
But what we need to do goes much further.	Gake nusi wòle be míawɔ la yi ŋgɔ wu ema kura.
I haven’t been able to do that yet	Nyemete ŋu wɔ ema haɖe o
I will treat him clearly.	Mawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu eme kɔ ƒã.
The house is about	Aƒea le abe 100 ene.
I can stay the same after a long job	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema ke le dɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe megbe
If he can do that, he can do anything.	Ne ate ŋu awɔ ema la, ate ŋu awɔ nusianu.
Focus on them.	Lé fɔ ɖe wo ŋu.
But he won’t do that.	Gake mawɔe nenema o.
Hours passed by.	Gaƒoƒo geɖe va yi.
He is not one of us.	Menye mía dometɔ ɖekae wònye o.
But I don’t want every man	Gake nyemedi ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe o
I should have put that together myself	Ðe wòle be nye ŋutɔ maƒo nya ma nu ƒu hafi
Someone looked up.	Ame aɖe fɔ mo dzi.
I don’t know who he is	Nyemenya amesi wònye o
I have no idea what these people are doing	Nyemenya nusi wɔm ame siawo le o
But he didn’t have to do that.	Gake mehiã be wòawɔ nu ma o.
I can’t figure out who it is.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ amesi wònye o.
There was nothing really.	Naneke menɔ anyi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I was surprised to hear what you had in mind	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ esi mese nusi le susu me na wò
In my head.	Le nye ta me.
But please know this.	Gake taflatse nya esia.
But he didn’t ask any questions.	Gake mebia nya aɖeke o.
But something is wrong.	Gake nane gblẽ.
He couldn’t see anything.	Mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
I didn’t want to go into the room	Nyemedi be mayi xɔa me o
And yet for someone else.	Eye ke hã na ame bubu.
Not that I should want to save his life	Menye ɖe wòle be madi be maɖe eƒe agbe o
I will do that tomorrow	Mawɔe nenema etsɔ
It felt like he was testing me.	Ewɔ nam abe ɖe wòle nɔnɔme dom kpɔ nam ene.
I want to go out tonight	Medi be mado go le zã sia me
If we can do it.	Ne míate ŋui la.
I don’t need to go on and on about these things	Mehiã be mayi edzi anɔ nu ƒom tso nu siawo ŋu o
There will be more problems.	Kuxi geɖe wu ava dzɔ.
Always doing the right thing.	Nusi sɔ wɔwɔ ɣesiaɣi.
Name of and its there.	Ŋkɔ na kple eƒe afima.
I was actually really tired	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖeɖi te ŋunye ŋutɔŋutɔ
I’ve never felt quite like that before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema tututu kpɔ o
It is our life and death.	Enye míaƒe agbe kple ku.
We’re all right tonight.	Míele nyuie le zã sia me.
Too many hands on them.	Asi geɖe akpa le wo dzi.
Just make you, boo.	Ðeko nàwɔ wò, boo.
But it wasn’t me.	Gake menye nyee o.
Things are different at a glance.	Nuwo to vovo le ŋku ɖeka me.
I just can’t do anything	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o
I actually like this better.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia dzɔa dzi nam wu.
I have the same issue	Nya ma ke le asinye hã
This went on for years.	Esia yi edzi ƒe geɖe.
I have the money.	Ga la le asinye.
Do my part.	Wɔ nye akpa aɖe.
He didn’t do anything.	Mewɔ naneke o.
It’s nothing of the sort.	Menye naneke si ƒomevi wònye o.
But I have to get out of here	Gake ele nam be mado le afisia
He would probably say the opposite.	Anɔ eme be agblɔ be nusi to vovo na emae.
For enough people usually.	Na ame siwo sɔ gbɔ zi geɖe.
It won’t work without it.	Mawɔ dɔ eya manɔmee o.
It won’t be like that.	Manɔ nenema o.
I remember it now like it was yesterday	Meɖo ŋku edzi azɔ abe etsɔ ene
An idea struck him.	Susu aɖe va dze edzi nɛ.
And, it seems possible.	Eye, edze abe ate ŋu adzɔ ene.
I can’t stand it, man	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu o, ame
Full name of each missing man	Ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe si bu la ƒe ŋkɔ bliboa
Something big is coming.	Nu gã aɖe gbɔna.
I can’t speak to this thing I have	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu na nu sia si le asinye o
I just have to do this	Ðeko wòle be mawɔ esia
I really don’t need to do that	Le nyateƒe me la, mehiã be mawɔ nenema o
Yet it would do nothing.	Ke hã mawɔ naneke o.
I miss you very, very much.	Mesusu wò ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
Not all of them, at least.	Menye wo katã ya teti o.
And no one was asking any questions.	Eye ame aɖeke menɔ nya aɖeke biam o.
I couldn’t figure out what had come over him	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi va dze edzi la dze sii o
It’s something some of us picked up.	Enye nusi mía dometɔ aɖewo fɔ.
However, one person did not.	Ke hã, ame ɖeka mewɔe nenema o.
I can only see us as we are now	Ðeko mate ŋu akpɔ mí abe alesi míele fifia ene
I have a big problem with that	Kuxi gã aɖe le ŋunye le ema ŋu
Perhaps he lost his own.	Ðewohĩ eya ŋutɔ tɔ bu nɛ.
I have to address some things here	Ele nam be makpɔ nu aɖewo gbɔ le afisia
I also didn’t like what replaced it	Nusi xɔ ɖe eteƒe hã medze ŋunye o
He refused, too.	Eya hã gbe.
I tried this, it doesn't work	Mete esia kpɔ, mewɔa dɔ o
You may have had them.	Ðewohĩ wo nɔ asiwò kpɔ.
And it worked very well	Eye ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ
I’m so glad to see you	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mekpɔ wò
His teacher was onto something.	Eƒe nufiala nɔ nane dzi.
I got out, no problem	Medo go, kuxi aɖeke menɔ eŋu o
But in reality	Gake le nyateƒe me la .
Provide .	Na .
He couldn't imagine two more different people.	Mete ŋu kpɔ ame eve siwo to vovo wu la le susu me o.
I didn’t know you were going anywhere.	Nyemenya be èle afi aɖeke yim o.
I think we can do it	Mesusu be míate ŋu awɔe
This can happen for a number of reasons.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ le susu geɖe ta.
And this process continues.	Eye ɖoɖo sia yi edzi.
I look forward to sharing more with you	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be magblɔ nu geɖe na mi
I stood like a rock	Metsi tre abe kpe ene
I hope to do the same thing here	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mawɔ nu ma ke le afisia hã
You’ll do the same thing.	Wò hã nàwɔ nu ma ke.
I needed a job and a place to live	Mehiã dɔ kple teƒe si manɔ
I know that name.	Menya ŋkɔ ma.
I have never seen one.	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke kpɔ o.
Eventually, it might.	Mlɔeba la, ɖewohĩ adzɔ nenema.
I know you can do it.	Menya be àte ŋui.
But there is no money.	Gake ga aɖeke meli o.
It’s just ours.	Mía tɔ koe wònye.
He also doesn’t know where that came from.	Menya afi si nya ma tso hã o.
Tell me a little about it.	Gblɔ eŋu nya vi aɖe nam.
That wasn’t what was bothering me	Menye nu ma nɔ fu ɖem nam o
I can get my stuff	Mate ŋu axɔ nye nuwo
That’s what I’m thinking.	Emae nye nye susu.
I am looking forward to being there	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be mava nɔ afima
I was about to kill more than this	Menɔ nu geɖe wu ge wu esia
Help him out in that regard.	Kpe asi ɖe eŋu le nya ma me.
Consider the positive results.	Kpɔ nu nyui siwo do tso eme la ɖa.
But things are a little different this time.	Gake nuwo to vovo vie zi sia.
I shouldn't know what happened to them	Mele be manya nusi va dzɔ ɖe wo dzi o
That makes sense.	Susu le nya ma me.
But still a child.	Gake ɖevi kokoko.
I hope it works.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be awɔ dɔ.
That’s not a bad thing	Ema menye nu gbegblẽ wɔwɔ o
His life was difficult.	Eƒe agbe sesẽ.
He couldn’t lie to her.	Mete ŋu da alakpa nɛ o.
I was so dependent on this guy for almost everything	Menɔ te ɖe ŋutsu sia dzi ale gbegbe le nusianu kloe me
What a bad life.	Agbe gbegblẽ kae nye si.
I can barely control it in its original form.	Nyemate ŋu aɖu edzi nyuie le eƒe nɔnɔme gbãtɔ me o.
It may not turn out the way you want it to.	Ðewohĩ mava eme abe alesi nèdi ene o.
But none of them worked.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ dɔ o.
I’m not seeing them	Nyemele wo kpɔm o
You shouldn’t do this, you know.	Mele be nàwɔ esia o, ènya.
Trust me, you know.	Ka ɖe dzinye.
I think it’s a great idea.	Mesusu be enye susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
That will be coming soon.	Ema ava kpuie.
In fact, it’s the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo na ema.
I have already arrived here	Meva ɖo afisia xoxo
I don’t know anything about it	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o
It was a very happy few days.	Enye ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo siwo me dzidzɔ le ŋutɔ.
I hope you can help me	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye
I don’t think it worked	Nyemesusu be ewɔ dɔ o
He wouldn’t do that sort of thing.	Mawɔ nu ma ƒomevi o.
I can’t answer if you are.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo eŋu nenye be èle nenema o.
The highway changed.	Mɔ gã la trɔ.

I will not have your death	Wò ku la manɔ asinye o
I tried and it worked	Medze agbagba eye wòwɔ dɔ
That someone is me.	Be ame aɖee nye nye.
I wasn’t sure what to do or say	Nyemeka ɖe nya si mawɔ alo agblɔ dzi o
No one knew exactly what to do.	Ame aɖeke menya nusi tututu wòawɔ o.
I had no money, no car and no job	Ga menɔ asinye o, ʋu aɖeke menɔ asinye o eye dɔ hã menɔ asinye o
I want what is best for everyone	Medi nusi anyo na amesiame
This knows, and it won’t.	Esia nya, eye mawɔe hã o.
I was very, very angry	Medo dziku vevie ŋutɔ
He wasn't sure he wanted to like her.	Meka ɖe edzi be yedi be yeƒe nu nyo ye ŋu o.
Not after that fight he had just had.	Menye le avu ma si wòwɔ teti koe nye ema megbe o.
I definitely don’t want to be here	Nyemedi godoo be manɔ afisia o
I shouldn’t have known that	Mele be manya nya ma hafi o
I couldn’t say or do anything.	Nyemete ŋu gblɔ nya aɖeke alo wɔ naneke o.
A large rock appeared	Kpe gã aɖe do mo ɖa
This can’t be my life.	Esia mate ŋu anye nye agbe o.
Help is needed.	Kpekpeɖeŋu hiã.
He didn’t tell any lies.	Megblɔ alakpa aɖeke o.
He would like to act.	Adi be wòawɔ nu.
I'm going to that guy.	Mele ŋutsu ma gbɔ yim.
I understood him.	Mese egɔme nɛ.
There’s just so much good stuff out there.	Ðeko nu nyui geɖe ŋutɔ le afima.

There is no meal plan.	Nuɖuɖu ƒe ɖoɖo aɖeke meli o.

That would be the last one.	Ema anye mamlɛtɔ.
It will do him good too.	Awɔ nyui nɛ hã.
It was a difficult life.	Agbe sesẽ aɖee wònye.
You can never look back.	Màte ŋu akpɔ megbe gbeɖe o.
I just couldn’t have heard that	Nyemate ŋu ase nya ma ko hafi o
He didn’t look good in it.	Medze nyuie le eme o.
It was a very big deal.	Enye nya gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
No one is waiting.	Ame aɖeke mele lalam o.
A book is just a book.	Agbalẽ aɖe koe agbalẽ aɖe nye.
He was a great guy.	Enye ame gã aɖe.
I’m not sure where to go from here.	Nyemeka ɖe afi si mayi tso afisia dzi o.
I am sure he will answer	Meka ɖe edzi be aɖo eŋu
Usually, it will be.	Zi geɖe la, anɔ eme.
I would love to know.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be manya.
I didn’t see what it was	Nyemekpɔ nusi wònye o
That won’t be comfortable.	Ema maɖe dzi ɖi o.
In a sense, this may be true.	Le mɔ aɖe nu la, esia ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.

Everyone knows each other.	Amesiame nya wo nɔewo.

But we really don’t know how much we know.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, míenya alesi gbegbe míenya o.
Still, all was well, obviously.	Ke hã, nuwo katã nɔ nyuie, edze ƒã.
I came across an occupied apartment	Meva ke ɖe xɔ aɖe si me ame aɖe le ŋu
And neither will anyone else.	Eye ame bubu aɖeke hã mawɔe nenema o.
I always knew he was passionate	Menya ɣesiaɣi be dzo le eme
A year itself.	Ƒe ɖeka ŋutɔ.
I reached out to his face.	Medo asi ɖe eƒe mo gbɔ.
Everyone has a different opinion.	Ame sia ame ƒe susu to vovo le eŋu.

Some of them are very well dressed.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo doa awu nyuie ŋutɔ.
We still have a chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gakpɔtɔ le mía si.
Something bad would have happened by now.	Anye ne nu gbegblẽ aɖe adzɔ fifia hafi.
His face showed nothing.	Eƒe mo meɖe naneke fia o.
One room later, more dead bodies.	Xɔ ɖeka megbe, ame kuku geɖe wu.
He had no money for that.	Ga aɖeke menɔ esi ɖe ema ta o.
I wondered what year I would say	Mebia ɖokuinye be ƒe kae magblɔ hã
I should have known he was a minor.	Ele be manya be enye ɖevi sue aɖe.
A hand into a hand there	Asi aɖe ɖe asi aɖe me le afima
We cannot predict things in advance.	Míate ŋu agblɔ nuwo ɖi do ŋgɔ o.
I wanted to say something to him	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖe nɛ
Some of them are really good.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is often excessive.	Zi geɖe la, esia gbɔ eme.

Nothing should be done quickly.	Mele be woawɔ naneke kaba o.

He couldn’t find anything.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe naneke ŋu o.
I can’t keep doing this to myself	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ esia wɔm ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o
Something is wrong here.	Nane gblẽ le afisia.
His hand came up.	Eƒe asi va do ɖe dzi.

I found some books on the issues he was working on	Mekpɔ agbalẽ aɖewo siwo ku ɖe nya siwo ŋu wònɔ dɔ wɔm le ŋu
The men in the car opened fire.	Ŋutsu siwo nɔ ʋua me la da tu.

There's no place like home, ' and you can stay there.	Teƒe aɖeke meli abe aƒe ene o, ’ eye àte ŋu anɔ afima.

However, things have changed in recent years.	Ke hã, nuwo trɔ le ƒe ʋɛ siwo va yi me.
I can deal with these people	Mate ŋu awɔ nu kple ame siawo
There was a lot riding on him	Nu geɖe nɔ sɔ dom ɖe edzi
I really don’t know how long that will take	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya ɣeyiɣi didi si ema axɔ o
I am something else too	Nye hã menye nu bubu aɖe
Two things have come out of this.	Nu eve do tso esia me.
His work is annoying.	Eƒe dɔa doa dziku.
It’s just not happening.	Ðeko mele edzi yim o.
And there is no child.	Eye vi aɖeke meli o.
I thought he was a good guy.	Mesusu be ŋutsu nyui aɖee wònye.
And its not new.	Eye eƒe menye nu yeye o.
I am very interested in you	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò ŋutɔ
And look at it.	Eye kpɔ ɖa.
I remember it well now	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie fifia
There was just no blood in it.	Ðeko ʋu aɖeke menɔ eme o.
I will do this.	Mawɔ esia.
There is no smoke now.	Dzudzɔ aɖeke meli fifia o.
Just as he had planned.	Abe alesi wòwɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu ene.
I decided to go on all of them	Meɖoe be mayi ɖe wo katã dzi
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Ðewohĩ vi aɖe, ɖewohĩ geɖe ŋutɔ.
The plaintiff has only one wrong here.	Nu gbegblẽ ɖeka koe le amesi tsɔ nya ɖe eŋu la ŋu le afisia.
Does anyone else feel this way?.	Ðe ame bubu aɖe hã se le eɖokui me alea?.
I don’t quite understand it myself.	Nye ŋutɔ nyemese egɔme tututu o.
But there were times when he couldn’t stand himself.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖewo nɔ anyi siwo mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe eɖokui nu o.
They are all different.	Wo katã to vovo.
Come on.	Eya ko.
I think a lot of people are missing that	Mesusu be ame geɖe le ema tom
It’s just that way.	Ðeko wòle nenema.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Menye nu bɔbɔe aɖee wònye be woawɔ o.
The whole night is ahead of us.	Zã bliboa le mía ŋgɔ.
Everyone knows about them	Amesiame nya nu tso wo ŋu
I was very happy too	Nye hã mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ
He can still do that.	Ate ŋu awɔe nenema kokoko.
Its good for you too.	Eƒe nyui na wò hã.
I want to talk more	Medi be maƒo nu geɖe wu
There is little food, nothing.	Nuɖuɖu sue aɖe koe le afima, naneke meli o.
Perhaps it can save lives.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu axɔ amewo ɖe agbe.
But the truth remains.	Gake nyateƒea gakpɔtɔ li.
In fact, for years.	Le nyateƒe me la, ƒe geɖe.
I can take care of myself now	Mate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye dzi fifia
Every situation is different and every person is different.	Nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe to vovo eye ame ɖesiaɖe hã to vovo.
See something, say something.	Kpɔ nane ɖa, gblɔ nya aɖe.
A voice protested	Gbe aɖe ɖi tsɔ tsi tre ɖe eŋu
I gave myself up.	Metsɔ ɖokuinye na.
At least two things.	Nu eve ya teti.
People just have so much.	Nu geɖe koe le amewo si.
But there is more to it than that.	Gake nu geɖe le eme wu ema.
But everyone is so busy.	Gake vovo mele ame sia ame ŋu ale gbegbe.
Please help what you will do.	Taflatse kpe asi ɖe nusi nàwɔ ŋu.
I had no idea they were here	Nyemenya kura be wole afisia o
I don’t think it will actually go	Nyemesusu be ayi ŋutɔŋutɔ o
He obviously recognized me too.	Edze ƒã be eya hã kpɔ nye dze sii.
I was just nervous.	Ðeko metsi dzodzodzoe.
I did something wrong	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖe
Maybe no one ever will.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖeke mawɔe gbeɖe o.
I also have a mortgage.	Aƒe ƒe fe aɖe le asinye hã.
I'll find a place for you	Makpɔ teƒe aɖe na wò
We don’t know where we are	Míenya afisi míele o
He had never heard of any of me.	Mese nye dometɔ aɖeke ŋkɔ kpɔ o.
Some men didn’t care.	Ŋutsu aɖewo metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
For many years now.	Ƒe geɖe enye sia.
Water everything.	Tsi nusianu.
He wasn’t the only one.	Menye eƒe ɖeka koe o.
Everybody knows everybody.	Ame sia ame nya ame sia ame.
Very, very good news	Nya nyui aɖe ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ
I tried to look away, but I couldn’t	Medze agbagba be maɖe ŋku ɖa, gake nyemete ŋui o
I could never hope for anything more	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ mɔ na naneke wu ema gbeɖe o
There is something.	Nane li.
That place is famous.	Teƒe ma xɔ ŋkɔ.
I don’t know what to say to anyone	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ na ame aɖeke o
I still have his gun.	Eƒe tu la gakpɔtɔ le asinye.
I know everyone else is right	Menya be ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ƒe nya le eteƒe
We had little in common.	Nu boo aɖeke menɔ mía dome si sɔ kple wo nɔewo o.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
Close, but not quite.	Te ɖe eŋu, gake menye tututu o.
I don’t know how to live without anger	Nyemenya alesi manɔ agbe dziku manɔmee o
I never expected anything like this	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na nane si le abe esia ene kpɔ o
I can prove it.	Mate ŋu aɖo kpe edzi.
The opposite is more interesting.	Nusi to vovo na emae doa dzidzɔ na ame wu.
I can take care of myself	Mete ŋu kpɔa ɖokuinye dzi
I couldn’t take my eyes off him for some reason	Nyemete ŋu ɖe nye ŋku ɖa le eŋu le susu aɖewo ta o
I shouldn’t have said anything to him	Mele be magblɔ nya aɖeke nɛ hafi o
He was a strong man.	Ŋutsu sesẽ aɖee wònye.
I felt satisfied.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme.
Also not sure if that matters.	Azɔ hã nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be ema le vevie o.
I know what’s going on	Menya nusi le edzi yim
It seemed like the only sensible thing to do.	Edze abe eya koe nye nu si me susu le be woawɔ ene.
I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
I wondered what had happened	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae dzɔ hã
I couldn’t tell which one it was.	Nyemete ŋu nya esi nye o.
I'll call you in an hour	Maƒo ka na wò le gaƒoƒo ɖeka megbe
For many, many years.	Ƒe geɖe, geɖe.
I don’t mean to upset you, please	Nyemedi be mado dziku na wò o, taflatse
You can go anywhere you want.	Àte ŋu ayi afi sia afi si nèdi.
He was an incredible person.	Enye ame si mewɔ nuku o.
Chances are this could be true.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ li be esia ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
There is simply nothing.	Ðeko naneke meli o.
This didn’t surprise me at all.	Esia mewɔ nuku nam kura o.
I want to get to know you all	Medi be manya mi katã
He couldn’t continue.	Mete ŋu yi edzi o.
Thank you so much for yours.	Akpe geɖe na mi.
I can get my stuff.	Mate ŋu axɔ nye nuwo.
I don’t know what’s wrong	Nyemenya nu si gblẽ o
What is this?.	Nu kae nye esia?.
Someone else got involved	Ame bubu aɖe hã ge ɖe eme
I was just interested in doing this	Ðeko metsɔ ɖe le esia wɔwɔ me
I started but I was tired	Medze egɔme gake ɖeɖi te ŋunye
I don’t know what just happened	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ teti koe nye ema o
So far, that hasn’t been happening in a smooth manner.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ema menɔ edzi yim le ɖoɖo nu o.
I can’t bear to see you like this	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi akpɔ wò alea o
I needed that job.	Mehiã dɔ ma.
Many lost their jobs.	Ame geɖe ƒe dɔ ge le wo si.
That’s the thing.	Emae nye nu la.
Lots of good ideas	Susu nyui geɖe
There are two reasons for this.	Susu eve siwo tae nye esia.
I think you might like it	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ adzɔ dzi na wò
I could go on all day.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi ŋkeke bliboa.
Not one, many.	Menye ɖeka o, geɖe.
But we are trying.	Gake míele agbagba dzem.
I can live on my own	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe le ɖokuinye si
I couldn’t see through it	Nyemete ŋu kpɔa nu le eme o
It was a great moment.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe.
I am a very good person.	Nyee nye ame nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I always enjoyed the night	Zã la dzɔa dzi nam ɣesiaɣi
I don’t have anything.	Naneke mele asinye o.
I don’t know if that’s right.	Nyemenya nenye be esia sɔ o.
I can have anything	Nusianu ate ŋu anɔ asinye
He had no interest in them before that time.	Metsɔ ɖeke le wo me do ŋgɔ na ɣeyiɣi ma o.
I saw his face in my mind	Mekpɔ eƒe mo le nye susu me
I'd say you enjoyed that	Magblɔ be ema do dzidzɔ na wò
We can do better than that.	Míate ŋu awɔ nu nyuie wu ema.
I have never seen a dog so discouraged	Nyemekpɔ avu aɖe si ƒo dzi ɖe le alea gbegbe kpɔ o
A man should never struggle with anger	Mele be ŋutsu nawɔ avu kple dziku gbeɖe o
I was angry.	Medo dziku.
There is nothing there.	Naneke mele afima o.
I didn’t have to go home	Mehiã be mayi aƒeme o
They wouldn’t have had enough time.	Anye ne ɣeyiɣi si sɔ gbɔ mava yi na wo o.
Think about this.	Bu nya sia ŋu kpɔ.
Leave them inside.	Gblẽ wo ɖe eme.
I lived like a man	Menɔ agbe abe ŋutsu ene
I think that was his last wish	Mesusu be emae nye eƒe didi mamlɛtɔ
I have to say something	Ele nam be magblɔ nya aɖe
I am deeply saddened by this situation.	Nɔnɔme sia te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ.
I didn’t know it was his dog	Nyemenya be eƒe avu ye o
There was no time.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I know he wants you too	Menya be eya hã di wò
You probably already know about it.	Ðewohĩ ènya nu tso eŋu xoxo.
Think about the city you live in.	Bu du si me nèle ŋu kpɔ.
It will promote them.	Ado wo ɖe ŋgɔ.
A whole new challenge.	Kuxi yeye kura aɖe.
I can’t take money from you	Nyemate ŋu axɔ ga le asiwò o
That's me.	Nyee nye ema.
But he needed blood.	Gake ehiã ʋu.
But maybe I should	Gake ɖewohĩ ele be mawɔe
He didn’t intend to go.	Meɖoe be yeayi o.
I expect nothing more.	Nyemele mɔ kpɔm na naneke wu ema o.
I think things will settle down in time	Mesusu be nuwo ava nɔ anyi nyuie le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe
I really wanted to meet him too	Nye hã medi vevie be mado go kplii
I know everybody in this town	Menya amesiame le du sia me
It wouldn’t surprise me	Mawɔ nuku nam o
I was glad I was there	Edzɔ dzi nam be menɔ afima
I have never been able to connect with him	Nyemete ŋu do ka kplii kpɔ o
Perhaps his face asked the question.	Ðewohĩ eƒe mo bia nya la.
I’ve tried it before.	Medze agbagba kpɔ.
I really had fun with that piece	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ kple akpa ma
Everything will be fine	Nusianu anɔ nyuie
I should never have come here.	Mele be mava afisia gbeɖe o.
It was just a way that came to mind.	Mɔ aɖe si va susu me nam koe wònye.
I've seen the whole thing.	Mekpɔ nu bliboa katã kpɔ.
I shouldn’t have it	Mele be manɔ eŋu o
He had obviously heard her name too.	Edze ƒã be eya hã se eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ.
I was always curious about it	Medi vevie be manya nu tso eŋu ɣesiaɣi
I can’t explain anything	Nyemate ŋu aɖe naneke me o
And there was hardly anyone there.	Eye ame aɖeke kura menɔ afima o.
I was very happy too	Nye hã mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ
I couldn’t feel anything	Nyemete ŋu se naneke le ɖokuinye me o
In the morning.	Le ŋdi me.
It was a pleasure to work with him.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be mewɔ dɔ kplii.
I can’t, there won’t be food.	Nyemate ŋui o, nuɖuɖu manɔ anyi o.
It doesn’t seem too surprising.	Edze abe mewɔ nuku akpa o ene.
Now, the reality comes.	Fifia, nu ŋutɔŋutɔ la va do.
I need something big	Mehiã nu gã aɖe
It probably happened before.	Anɔ eme be edzɔ do ŋgɔ.
I can’t afford for you to surprise me like this	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ga be nàwɔ nuku nam alea o
I gave you the right price.	Metsɔ asi si sɔ la na wò.
I know this might take some time	Menya be ɖewohĩ esia axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe
You can’t save them all.	Màte ŋu axɔ na wo katã o.
Open your mind to it.	Ʋu wò susu ɖe eŋu.
He never treated her as if he were younger.	Mewɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu abe ɖe wòle sue wu ene gbeɖe o.
I can’t allow that.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ nenema o.
I probably would have stayed there for hours	Anɔ eme be menɔ afima gaƒoƒo geɖe hafi
You can let go of that at some point.	Àte ŋu aɖe asi le nya ma ŋu le ɣeyiɣi aɖe me.
I will have to deal with them	Ahiã be mawɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu
I’m so glad I’m in a familiar place.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mele teƒe aɖe si amewo nya nyuie.
I haven’t tried this yet.	Nyemete esia kpɔ haɖe o.
That seems pretty amazing.	Ema dze abe ɖe wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ ene.
I couldn’t look at them	Nyemete ŋu lé ŋku ɖe wo ŋu o
You have to do this for me.	Ele be nàwɔ esia nam.
I have asked that question many times.	Mebia nya ma zi geɖe.
But I shouldn’t be surprised.	Gake mele be wòawɔ nuku nam o.
And neither did his teacher.	Eye eƒe nufiala hã mewɔe nenema o.
I know his character	Menya eƒe nɔnɔme
But people want this.	Gake amewo di esia.
I think he would have liked to try	Mesusu be anye ne adi be yeate kpɔ hafi
I should never have done that	Ðe mele be mawɔ nu ma gbeɖe o hafi
I felt strange.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mewɔ nuku nam.
I have nothing to say.	Nya aɖeke mele asinye magblɔ o.
But he didn’t answer.	Gake meɖo eŋu o.
I couldn’t decide.	Nyemete ŋu tso nya me o.
That’s what bothered me.	Emae nye nusi ɖe fu nam.
I remember exactly where he was	Meɖo ŋku afisi tututu wònɔ dzi
We have a good location.	Teƒe nyui aɖe le mía si.
I like that in a man.	Ema dzɔa dzi nam le ŋutsu me.
But you never know, people have changed.	Gake mènya gbeɖe o, amewo trɔ.
And it can help you.	Eye ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
It’s got you.	Ewɔ mo.
We are ready.	Míele klalo.
I wanted to try one last thing	Medi be mate nu mamlɛtɔ ɖeka kpɔ
I tried but its not working.	Medze agbagba gake eƒe mewɔa dɔ o.
Nice to meet you too	Enye dzidzɔ nam be medo go wò hã
It will cost more still.	Axɔ asi geɖe wu kokoko.
He never said a word to her.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke nɛ kpɔ o.
This is probably true.	Anɔ eme be nya sia nye nyateƒe.
I am nervous now	Metsi dzodzodzoe fifia
This money comes with a condition.	Ga sia va kple nɔnɔme aɖe.
There just isn’t much to it.	Ðeko nu geɖe mele eme o.
He did a good job, too.	Ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe hã.
And everyone who comes my way.	Eye ame sia ame si va nye mɔ dzi.
I think they’re making progress	Mesusu be wole ŋgɔ yim
I’m surprised he hasn’t succeeded yet	Ewɔ nuku nam be medze edzi haɖe o
Not nearly ready.	Menye klalo kloe o.
That’s another situation that doesn’t make sense right now.	Ema nye nɔnɔme bubu si me susu mele fifia o.
They’re a little smaller.	Wole sue vie wu.
I can’t live without it	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe ema manɔmee o
I just can’t do anything.	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
Thousands of people have a say here.	Ame akpe geɖe ƒe nya le afisia.
In another moment, he put his hand on the car.	Le ɣeyiɣi bubu me la, etsɔ eƒe asi ɖo ʋua dzi.
But he heard none of them.	Gake mese wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
But it didn’t bother me too much	Gake meɖe fu nam akpa o
I don’t know if this book existed	Nyemenya ne agbalẽ sia nɔ anyi o
I really need to talk to you	Ehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ be maƒo nu kpli wò
I definitely need help around the house.	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu le aƒea me godoo.
I don’t want to talk to anyone	Nyemedi be maƒo nu kple ame aɖeke o
There were many days when it wasn’t.	Ŋkeke geɖe nɔ anyi siwo me menɔ nenema o.
I think we might have a surprise	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ nusi wɔa nuku na ame la anɔ mía si
Little did he know it would be his last.	Menya be anye yeƒe mamlɛtɔ o.
I just never got close to anyone	Ðeko nyemete ɖe ame aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o
I should have done the job right the first time	Ðe wòle be mawɔ dɔa nyuie zi gbãtɔ hafi
I allowed myself to be satisfied	Meɖe mɔ be nye dzi dze eme
I know that sounds weird	Menya be nya ma ɖi nusi mewɔ nuku o
All kinds of money.	Ga ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe.
I was trying to find you	Menɔ agbagba dzem be madi wò
I tried several times, but he wouldn’t let me	Mete kpɔ zi geɖe, gake meɖe mɔ nam o
You can’t just walk out.	Màte ŋu ado go ko o.
That's good for me.	Ema nyo nam.
If only he had done this.	Ne ɖe wòwɔ esia la, ne ɖe wòwɔ nenema ko.
I want to be like you	Medi be manɔ abe wò ene
We hope you enjoy this new feature.	Míele mɔ kpɔm be akpa yeye sia adzɔ dzi na wò.
I know you will enjoy it	Menya be adzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ
That’s the most interesting one.	Emae nye esi doa dzidzɔ nam wu.
I just realized this before	Ðeko mekpɔ esia dze sii do ŋgɔ
But he wasn’t angry or worried.	Gake medo dziku alo tsi dzi o.
And it’s his ship.	Eye eƒe meli ye.
There are many others here	Bubu geɖe le afisia
I want something in my mouth	Medi be nane nanɔ nye nu me
After that, things seemed to change.	Le ema megbe la, edze abe nuwo trɔ ene.
I was very impressed with him	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
I can’t get together	Nyemate ŋu aƒo ƒu o
None of them did me any good.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meɖe vi aɖeke nam o.
I am not alone in feeling this way.	Menye nye ɖeka koe se le ɖokuinye me alea o.
I think that’s all we can do now	Mesusu be ema koe nye nusi míate ŋu awɔ fifia
That no one should have to live the way he did.	Be mele be ame aɖeke nanɔ agbe abe alesi wònɔ ene o.
It was incredible.	Enye nusi mexɔ se o.
But my mind is another matter.	Gake nye susu hã nye nya bubu.
He looked very tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ŋutɔ ene.
I don’t know, exactly.	Nyemenya o, tututu.
I had no issue with it	Nya aɖeke menɔ asinye le eŋu o
There is no turning back.	Trɔ yi megbe meli o.
I will do what you want	Mawɔ nu si nèdi
Just a little bit of money	Ga sue aɖe ko
I'm out now.	Medo go fifia.
He will tell me what to do.	Agblɔ nusi mawɔ nam.
Look at a man’s face.	Kpɔ ŋutsu ƒe mo ɖa.
Things came to an end.	Nuwo va wu enu.
It looks good.	Edze nyuie.
But you can go this route.	Gake àte ŋu azɔ mɔ sia dzi.
If there is one.	Ne ɖe li la.
I didn’t expect to see you	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be makpɔ wò o
I'd better try something else	Anyo be mate nu bubu aɖe kpɔ
I can’t remember now though	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi fifia o gake
If it wasn’t, it wouldn’t, but it is	Ne ɖe mele nenema o la, anye ne mewɔe nenema o, gake ele nenema
He had nothing to offer.	Naneke menɔ esi o.
I wondered how anyone could bite a snake.	Mebia ɖokuinye be aleke ame aɖe ate ŋu aɖu da hã.
A man she had never seen before stepped forward	Ŋutsu aɖe si mekpɔ kpɔ o la do afɔ ɖe ŋgɔ
And I didn’t touch it either.	Eye nye hã nyemeka asi eŋu o.
I didn’t understand why he was alone	Nyemese nu si tae eya ɖeka nɔ la gɔme o
It's going on at four.	Ele edzi yim le ene dzi.
I think he might not be the only one.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ menye eya ɖeka koe o.
That’s that for us.	Emae nye ema na mí.
We don’t have one thing there.	Nu ɖeka aɖeke mele mía si le afima o.
You can’t just isolate it.	Màte ŋu aɖee ɖe vovo ko o.
And, for good reason.	Eye, susu nyui aɖe tae.
A few people also sit nearby	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo hã nɔa anyi ɖe afima gbɔ
That will eventually change.	Ema ava trɔ mlɔeba.
I couldn’t do it	Nyemete ŋu wɔe o
He is eating very little.	Nu sue aɖe koe wòle ɖum.
It doesn’t surprise me at all	Mewɔa nuku nam kura o
He’s a character that is.	Eye wònye ame aɖe si nye...
I want to sit with you	Medi be manɔ anyi kpli wò
I met some extremely nice people.	Medo go ame nyui aɖewo siwo gbɔ eme.
We don’t know how he got in there.	Míenya alesi wòwɔ ge ɖe eme o.
I had a great time there	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ le afima
I saw his anger	Mekpɔ eƒe dziku
He had to do that himself.	Ele be eya ŋutɔ nawɔ ema.
I knew it would be great.	Menya be anye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
That’s all there is to it.	Ema koe nye ema.
He doesn’t belong here.	Menye afisia tɔ wònye o.
I shouldn’t have been surprised.	Mele be wòawɔ nuku nam hafi o.
But people continued to fight each other over it	Gake amewo yi edzi nɔ avu wɔm kple wo nɔewo le esia ta
I have two issues.	Nya eve le asinye.
This is a fact.	Esia nye nyateƒe.
I know a few things about you.	Menya nu ʋɛ aɖewo tso ŋuwò.
I couldn’t go on without you	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi ne menye wòe o
It’s just an incredible book.	Agbalẽ si mexɔ se o koe wònye.
I reached for my gun	Medo asi ɖe nye tu la gbɔ
He is not a representative.	Menye ame si le eteƒe o.
I think this time I was surprised	Mesusu be fifia ya ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
I just can’t take respect from him	Ðeko nyemate ŋu axɔ bubu le esi o
After my first loss.	Le nye nu gbãtɔ si bu megbe.
And it’s a good thing he didn’t.	Eye nu nyui aɖee wònye be mewɔe nenema o.
I think one of two things happened	Mesusu be nu eve dometɔ ɖeka dzɔ
He didn't know what was wrong with this place.	Menya nusi gblẽ le teƒe sia ŋu o.
I reached this afternoon.	Meɖo ŋdɔ sia gbɔ.
He couldn’t find any.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeke ŋu o.
It will take some time.	Axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
For many years.	Ƒe geɖe.
A simple and beautiful dress	Awu bɔbɔe aɖe si nya kpɔ ŋutɔ
So much so that there was only one person.	Ale gbegbe be ame ɖeka koe nɔ anyi ta.
I touched it a little	Meka asi eŋu vie
Exactly what he was hoping for.	Nusi tututu wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na.
What works for me may not necessarily work for you.	Ðewohĩ nusi wɔa dɔ nam la mawɔ dɔ na wò kokoko o.
People are waiting for me	Amewo le lalam nam
Most of the time he didn’t.	Zi geɖe la, mewɔe nenema o.
Maybe it will work for you.	Ðewohĩ awɔ dɔ na wò.
This is actually a good idea.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia nye susu nyui.
Which is what we have now.	Nusi nye nusi le mía si fifia.
I told him we were on our way.	Megblɔ nɛ be míele mɔ dzi.
I haven’t heard from him in at least a month	Ɣleti ɖeka ya teti enye sia si nyemese nya aɖeke tso eŋu o
Everything exists twice.	Nusianu li zi eve.
This was very helpful.	Esia kpe ɖe ame ŋu ŋutɔ.
I can’t go further than that	Nyemate ŋu ayi ŋgɔ wu ema o
That’s so good.	Ema nyo ale gbegbe.
I do hope it comes.	Mewɔa esia le mɔ kpɔm be ava.
Everything is nothing.	Nusianu nye naneke o.
That just doesn’t matter.	Ðeko ema mehiã o.
It’s not really there.	Menye ɖe wòle afima ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I was home alone and home alone	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ aƒeme eye nye ɖeka menɔ aƒeme
He can’t be a man.	Mate ŋu anye ŋutsu o.
You don’t have anything.	Naneke mele asiwò o.
It’s all very clear.	Wo katã me kɔ ŋutɔ.
I guess he wasn’t sure, either	Mesusu be meka ɖe edzi o, nenema ke hã
The whole thing is very fast paced.	Nu bliboa le du dzi ŋutɔ.
I like this detailed piece of yours	Wò akpa sia si me kɔ nyuie la dze ŋunye
Right there right there.	Le afima tututu.
I’m glad people can see what we have here.	Edzɔ dzi nam be amewo ate ŋu akpɔ nusi le mía si le afisia.
I don’t know how it got here	Nyemenya alesi wòwɔ va ɖo afisia o
I have to do it	Ele be mawɔe .
I should like to say	Ele be madi be magblɔ be
It was my first, actually.	Enye nye gbãtɔ, le nyateƒe me.
The car changed everything.	Ʋua trɔ nusianu.
It just didn’t work very well.	Ðeko mewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ o.
Just like that.	Abe ale si ko.
I also need a crazy job	Mehiã dɔ si me susu mele o hã
They will be aligned with.	Woawɔ ɖeka kple.

I can’t explain it any better	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eme nyuie wu ema o
I came to say goodnight	Meva be magblɔ be zã nyui
Nothing else can do this.	Nu bubu aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ esia o.
I am the one who is trying	Nyee nye ame si le agbagba dzem
Clearly, this is not true.	Edze ƒã be esia menye nyateƒe o.
They are at your feet.	Wole wò afɔ nu.
We can overcome them.	Míate ŋu aɖu wo dzi.
The truth surprised him.	Nyateƒea wɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
He is waiting for me.	Ele lalam nam.
But one thing is different.	Gake nu ɖeka ya to vovo.
Once you are finished.	Ne ènya wu enu ko la.
I was there, you know	Menɔ afima, ènya
But we had no idea.	Gake susu aɖeke menɔ mía si o.
In many cases, you have no idea.	Le go geɖe me la, susu aɖeke mele asiwò o.
Mine worked great that way.	Nye tɔ wɔ dɔ ŋutɔ nenema.
I definitely wanted more	Nu geɖe wu didi nɔ menye godoo
Nowadays, that is more than enough.	Fifia la, ema sɔ gbɔ wu ema.
I really want to do it	Medi be mawɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ
It was a pleasure to be in his company.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be menɔ eƒe ha me.
I have never been able to do that	Nyemete ŋu wɔe nenema kpɔ o
I can explain anything	Mate ŋu aɖe nusianu me
I need food	Mehiã nuɖuɖu
Keep your head up.	Na wò ta nanɔ dzi.
Look at this house.	Kpɔ aƒe sia ɖa.
But I don’t know about a ship.	Gake nyemenya nu tso meli aɖe ŋu o.
It made no sense to them.	Susu aɖeke menɔ eme na wo o.
I’m happy to do it.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mawɔe.
I can’t be a part of this anymore	Nyemate ŋu anye akpa aɖe le esia me azɔ o
You have to fight your way through it.	Ele be nàwɔ avu kple wò mɔ to eme.
Everyone gets that.	Amesiame xɔa ema.
No one knows how far it can go.	Ame aɖeke menya afisi wòate ŋu aɖo o.
Every shot is original.	Tu ɖesiaɖe nye gbãtɔ.
You know it’s true.	Ènya be enye nyateƒe.
I became mentally ill.	Meva dze dɔ le nye susu me.
I have to stay focused	Ele be mayi edzi anɔ susu me nam
I think that might help	Mesusu be ema ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò
I need something in my life.	Mehiã nane le nye agbe me.
I got along really well with one of them	Mewɔ ɖeka kple wo dometɔ ɖeka nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ
But you’re not going to die now.	Gake mèle kuku ge fifia o.
I will never have another opportunity like this	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ bubu aɖeke manɔ asinye abe esia ene gbeɖe o
I'm sure he was never there	Meka ɖe edzi be menɔ afima kpɔ o
Now that was interesting.	Fifia nya ma do dzidzɔ na ame.
Great! 	Nyo ŋutɔ!
I fell in love with him	Mete eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
I never understood what he wanted from us	Nyemese nusi dim wònɔ tso mía si la gɔme kpɔ o
A very nice person too	Ame nyui aɖe ŋutɔ hã
I have been here myself before.	Nye ŋutɔ menɔ afisia va yi.
That wouldn’t be in my house	Ema manɔ nye aƒe me o
He likes money.	Ga dzɔa dzi nɛ.
I’m not the man for the job	Menye nyee nye ŋutsu si le dɔa ta o
Who knows if anything will happen.	Amekae nya ne nane adzɔ.
I have never been able to find out his true nature	Nyemete ŋu nya eƒe nɔnɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o
He had never seen so many.	Mekpɔ ame geɖe nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
I was definitely impressed with sweat	Mewɔ dɔ ɖe fifia dzi godoo
Everything went well.	Nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
I've already put hours into this	Metsɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe de esia me xoxo
I don’t know about it	Nyemenya nu tso eŋu o
I had to call the police	Ele be maƒo ka na kpovitɔwo
But he didn’t scold her.	Gake meka mo nɛ o.
Please suggest me how to do it?.	Taflatse do susu ɖa nam alesi mawɔe?.
The big hand ran up four.	Asi gã la ƒu du yi ene dzi.
And let them do the work.	Eye mina woawɔ dɔa.
I can achieve so much more	Mate ŋu aɖo nu geɖe wu gbɔ
You will have so much in your home.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ anɔ asiwò le wò aƒe me.
I’m glad I got rid of them	Edzɔ dzi nam be meɖe wo le asinye
I never knew enough.	Nyemenya nusi sɔ gbɔ kpɔ o.
It’s been a long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
And that’s a problem for me.	Eye ema nye kuxi nam.
I was just in the situation I grew up in. Everything	Ðeko menɔ nɔnɔme si me metsi le me koe nye nusianu
Faster feet.	Afɔ siwo le du dzi wu.
But he won’t do it.	Gake mawɔe o.
This is a machine.	Esia nye mɔ̃ aɖe.
This doesn’t seem to work.	Edze abe esia mewɔa dɔ o ene.
I think this book will help you	Mesusu be agbalẽ sia akpe ɖe ŋuwò
I have to get you out of this water	Ele nam be maɖe wò le tsi sia me
But please let us have this.	Gake taflatse na nya sia nanɔ mía si.
I had some fun with him	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ aɖewo kplii
It’s a very strange thing	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ
I would be very happy.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I don’t mean to let you down	Menye ɖe meɖoe be maɖe asi le ŋuwò o
He can't talk now.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu fifia o.
But he went further than that.	Gake ewɔ nu yi ŋgɔ wu ema.
Death is a little unreal.	Ku menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ vie o.
That’s what you are.	Wòe nye ema.
A lot was riding on this	Nu geɖe nɔ sɔ dom ɖe esia dzi
This thing is amazing.	Nu sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I tried many times	Medze agbagba zi geɖe
If he had any.	Ne ɖeke nɔ esi la.
But why does it matter.	Gake nukatae wòle vevie ɖo.
I hope this helps someone.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia akpe ɖe ame aɖe ŋu.
If you can hear.	Ne àte ŋu ase.
I could hear her voice now	Mete ŋu se eƒe gbe fifia
He didn’t seem to do anything	Edze abe mewɔ naneke o ene
I am sure you will do the same for me	Meka ɖe edzi be wò hã nàwɔ nenema ke nam
I did some work for them	Mewɔ dɔ aɖewo na wo
Something must be wrong with me.	Anɔ eme be nane gblẽ le ŋunye.
I was interested in the truth and nothing else	Metsɔ ɖe le nyateƒea me ke menye nu bubu aɖeke o
Much more, too.	Nu geɖe wu hã.
But nothing is working for me.	Gake naneke mele dɔ wɔm nam o.
I’ll explain that to you	Maɖe nya ma me na wò
A point here, a point there	Nya aɖe le afisia, nya aɖe le afima
But it doesn’t work.	Gake mewɔa dɔ o.
I want to do more.	Medi be mawɔ geɖe wu.
Not that night, not any night.	Menye zã ma me o, menye zã aɖeke o.
I only know how to be him	Ale si mawɔ anye eya koe menya
This is appropriate, of course.	Esia sɔ ya.
But that time didn’t come.	Gake ɣeyiɣi ma meva ɖo o.
I have several of them.	Wo dometɔ geɖe le asinye.
I was having so much fun.	Menɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm ale gbegbe.
I just wanted to talk to him	Ðeko medi be maƒo nu kplii
I can’t remember what life was like before them.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku alesi agbe nɔ do ŋgɔ na wo dzi o.
I just asked myself.	Ðeko mebia ɖokuinye be.
We don’t know, we can’t imagine what else it could be.	Míenya o, míate ŋu akpɔ nu bubu si wòate ŋu anye la le susu me o.
I gave my name to.	Metsɔ nye ŋkɔ na.

I was looking forward to it, out of curiosity	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie, le didi be manya nu ta
I was able to control myself.	Mete ŋu ɖu ɖokuinye dzi.
I told him about you, and he didn’t believe me	Megblɔ wò ŋu nya nɛ, eye mexɔ dzinye se o
How can you make a mistake?.	Aleke nàwɔ awɔ vodada?.
Anyone can do it.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu awɔe.
I was planning to go out early.	Menɔ ɖoɖo wɔm be mado go kaba.
I just wanted to get out of the hole.	Ðeko medi be mado le doa me.
He liked it in a way.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ le mɔ aɖe nu.
That is the first, most important thing.	Emae nye nu gbãtɔ, si le vevie wu.
He had a job to do now.	Dɔ aɖe nɔ esi wòawɔ fifia.
Here we have nothing like it.	Le afisia la, naneke mele mía si si sɔ kple esia o.
I don’t really know any of them	Nyemenya wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I really don’t think that makes sense.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemesusu be susu le eme be magblɔ nya ma o.
I glanced down.	Meɖe ŋku ɖe anyi.
He doesn’t care what anyone else thinks.	Metsɔ ɖeke le nusi ame bubu aɖe susu me o.
Please let me go.	Taflatse ɖe asi le ŋunye.
I have an idea where it might be	Susu aɖe le asinye le afisi wòate ŋu anɔ
Please help us in this situation.	Taflatse kpe ɖe mía ŋu le nɔnɔme sia me.
A man who has nothing	Ŋutsu si si naneke mele o
We can put this this way.	Míate ŋu agblɔ esia ale.
Tell me how you are.	Gblɔ ale si nèle nam.
I couldn’t get his face out of my head	Nyemete ŋu ɖe eƒe mo le nye ta me o
Over the years this has never been a problem.	Le ƒe siwo va yi me la, esia menye kuxi kpɔ o.
And you are me.	Eye wòe nye nye.
I just want to know	Ðeko medi be manya
I tried hard last time	Medze agbagba vevie zi mamlɛtɔ
It could be a mistake.	Ate ŋu anye vodada.
However, many people don’t know you.	Ke hã, ame geɖe menya wò o.
But not for anyone else.	Gake menye na ame bubu aɖeke o.
I fell down.	Medze anyi.
I like things the way they are	Nuwo dzɔa dzi nam abe alesi wole ene
This continued to go well.	Esia yi edzi nɔ edzi yim nyuie.
It was a shock to me	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
Everyone knows that much.	Amesiame nya nu ma gbegbe.
I should have said something	Ðe wòle be magblɔ nya aɖe hafi
I'm kind of interested in this stuff.	Metsɔ ɖe le nu sia me le mɔ aɖe nu.
I thought he was a good man	Mesusu be enye ame nyui aɖe
We can search there.	Míate ŋu adi nu le afima.
I can’t tell what’s going on behind them	Nyemate ŋu anya nusi le edzi yim le wo megbe o
He had been quite surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ tsã.
Of all kinds.	Le ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe me.
This is very important.	Esia le vevie ŋutɔ.
I wasn’t sure what to do	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ dzi o
But so many things.	Gake nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
There is simply nothing.	Ðeko naneke meli o.
Or a week of.	Alo kwasiɖa ɖeka ƒe.
I replied that I enjoyed that too	Meɖo eŋu be ema hã doa dzidzɔ nam
No one is backing down.	Ame aɖeke mele megbe yim o.
I don’t think he can keep up	Nyemesusu be ate ŋu awɔ ɖe edzi o
It’s a little bit of everything.	Enye nusianu ƒe akpa sue aɖe.
No one came along.	Ame aɖeke meva o.
He will find something for her to do.	Akpɔ nane nɛ wòawɔ.
But we can do more.	Gake míate ŋu awɔ geɖe wu.
And real blood.	Kple ʋu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
A name struck me as unfamiliar	Ŋkɔ aɖe dze nam be nyemenya o
Some others, impossible.	Ame bubu aɖewo, manya wɔ o.
I don’t know now.	Nyemenya fifia o.
This is a new idea	Esia nye susu yeye aɖe
No one will see this.	Ame aɖeke makpɔ esia o.
You can do a couple of things.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu eve aɖewo.
I’m surprised I didn’t see you there	Ewɔ nuku nam be nyemekpɔ wò le afima o
I asked for two.	Mebia eve.
I tried to see past them to no avail	Medze agbagba be makpɔ nu to wo ŋu gake medze edzi o
I told him that he actually could	Megblɔ nɛ be le nyateƒe me la, ate ŋui
Two plus two is four.	Eve kpe ɖe eve ŋu nye ene.
I made time for everything	Mekpɔ ɣeyiɣi ɖe nusianu ŋu
I don’t know where he is	Nyemenya afi si wòle o
But that’s really the only reason.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, ema koe nye susu si tae.
This idea, and that.	Susu sia, kple ema.
He might actually believe me.	Ðewohĩ axɔ dzinye ase ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I can never remember feeling this way	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi gbeɖe be mese le ɖokuinye me alea o
I could have kept going	Anye ne mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim hafi
I felt the need to explain	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ehiã be maɖe eme
I really don’t know what he did.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nusi wòwɔ o.
It was something no one had ever seen before.	Enye nusi ame aɖeke mekpɔ kpɔ o.
I wanted to try something different.	Medi be mate nu bubu aɖe kpɔ.
But this is a good thing.	Gake esia nye nu nyui aɖe.
I was almost alone there	Nye ɖeka kloe nɔ afima
I want to call you	Medi be maƒo ka na wò
Law can still work for you.	Se ate ŋu awɔ dɔ na wò kokoko.
I don’t know what to say	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ o
I’ve seen you, too	Mekpɔ wò hã ɖa
Much more than that.	Nu geɖe wu nenema.
I just couldn’t get it right.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu se egɔme nyuie o.
He did his job.	Ewɔ eƒe dɔ.
I let my mind drift back	Meɖe mɔ nye susu trɔ yi megbe
Beware of it!.	Kpɔ nyuie le eŋu!.
I apologize for the way this is	Meɖe kuku ɖe alesi esia le ta
Just the way it was.	Ale si wònɔ ko.
It is the heart of the good life.	Enye agbe nyui la ƒe dzi.
I actually wanted to go	Le nyateƒe me la, medi be mayi
Or to anyone for that matter.	Alo na ame sia ame le nya ma ta.
I tried several times with the same result	Mete kpɔ zi geɖe eye nu ɖeka ma ke do tso eme
I know we can do it.	Menya be míate ŋu awɔe.
It could not have been an easy thing to do.	Mate ŋu anye nu bɔbɔe aɖe si woawɔ hafi o.
I have to work on it	Ele be mawɔ dɔ le eŋu
I wish that were true	Ne ɖe nya ma nye nyateƒe la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
I need to see you now	Ele be makpɔ wò fifia
Tell him everything.	Gblɔ nya sia nya nɛ.
I was expecting you earlier	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na wò do ŋgɔ
Something is wrong.	Nane gblẽ.
The truth is a bit different.	Nyateƒea to vovo vie.
In fact, it worked the opposite way.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ dɔ si to vovo na ema.
I am one of so many	Menye ame geɖe ŋutɔ dometɔ ɖeka
I know you will enjoy it.	Menya be adzɔ dzi na wò.
But he will, he will.	Gake awɔe, awɔe.
Not surprising, really.	Mewɔ nuku o, le nyateƒe me.
There are two parts there	Akpa eve le afima
Take a closer look.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu nyuie.
It’s necessary these days.	Ehiã le ŋkeke siawo me.
I just want to get the job done once.	Ðeko medi be mawɔ dɔa zi ɖeka.
I have something for you.	Nane le asinye na wò.
Now, what are we going to do about it?.	Azɔ, nukae míele wɔwɔ ge tso eŋu?.
I can’t really talk.	Nyemete ŋu ƒoa nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I liked him too.	Nye hã eƒe nu lé dzi nam.
People are not like that.	Amewo mele nenema o.
We don’t really have anything.	Naneke mele mía si ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Some of them have been around.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo nɔ anyi kpɔ.
I will explain it to you shortly.	Maɖe eme na wò kpuie.
He will take care of that for you.	Akpɔ ema gbɔ na wò.
Everyone has no idea.	Ame sia ame ƒe susu aɖeke.
I stood there and didn’t know what to do	Metsi tre ɖe afima eye nyemenya nusi mawɔ o
I want to talk to you, touch you	Medi be maƒo nu kpli wò, ka asi ŋuwò
He seemed very interested in that.	Edze abe etsɔ ɖe le nya ma me ŋutɔ ene.
That’s one thing.	Ema nye nya ɖeka.
The money is already available.	Ga la va li xoxo.
I don’t understand the reason for this	Nyemese susu si tae esia dzɔ ɖo la gɔme o
But, it doesn’t look like it will be for much longer.	Gake, edze abe manɔ nenema ɣeyiɣi didi wu ene o.
I like that kind of thing	Nu ma ƒomevi dzɔa dzi nam
I was surprised here.	Mewɔ nuku nam le afisia.
Now it could be one or two.	Fifia ate ŋu anye ɖeka alo eve.
Why are we .	Nukatae míele .
I just didn’t think it would be my own car	Ðeko nyemesusu be anye nye ŋutɔ nye ʋu o
But we don’t have a few years.	Gake ƒe ʋɛ aɖewo mele mía si o.
A job.	Dɔ aɖe.
I had somewhere to go, someone to be with	Teƒe aɖe nɔ asinye mayi, ame aɖe si manɔ kplii
Either way is so good.	Mɔ ɖesiaɖe nyo ale gbegbe.
I was having the same problem.	Kuxi ma ke nɔ fu ɖem nam.
It is much more than that.	Enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema kura.
I kind of meant something else	Nu bubu aɖee megblɔ le mɔ aɖe nu
They are on the road.	Wole mɔ dzi.
I can’t let that stand	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ nya ma nɔ te o
I lost mine last night	Nye tɔ bu le zã si va yi me
Or that, too.	Alo ema hã.
I know about all of that	Menya nu tso ema katã ŋu
For one thing, we can never feed everyone.	Nu ɖekae nye be míate ŋu ana nuɖuɖu amesiame gbeɖe o.
We had the police.	Kpovitɔwo nɔ mía si.
I have a new job now	Dɔ yeye aɖe le ŋunye fifia
In fact, just the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na ema koe.
You can’t say that.	Màte ŋu agblɔ nya ma o.
It doesn’t seem like much.	Medze abe nu geɖe ene o.
These people had worked well for him before.	Ame siawo wɔ dɔ nyuie nɛ tsã.
I probably could have walked there in the same amount of time	Anɔ eme be mate ŋu azɔ ayi afima le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me hafi
I can never remember	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi gbeɖe o
He already seems to have a plan.	Ewɔ abe ɖoɖo aɖe le esi xoxo ene.
I saw the same situation coming.	Mekpɔ nɔnɔme ma ke si gbɔna.
And that’s the big takeaway from that.	Eye emae nye nu gã si metsɔ tso ema me.
I had trusted that man	Meka ɖe ŋutsu ma dzi kpɔ
You are not a little kid.	Menye ɖevi sue aɖee nènye o.
That is quite different.	Ema to vovo kura.
I want to hit somebody	Medi be maƒo ame aɖe
I hope they are really good	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wole nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ
I will have that.	Anɔ asinye nenema.

This process takes very little time.	Dɔ sia wɔwɔ xɔa ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe ko.
That's working well.	Ema le dɔ wɔm nyuie.
He couldn’t save them.	Mete ŋu xɔ na wo o.
That’s what he really likes.	Emae nye nusi dzɔa dzi nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ.

Rarely was one left behind.	Ƒã hafi ame ɖeka tsi megbe.

That’s right.	Ema sɔ.
It really hit us hard.	Edze mía dzi vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Still, thank you.	Ke hã, akpe na wò.
I thought something bad had happened	Mesusu be nu gbegblẽ aɖe dzɔ
It’s a small part of everything that makes up my life.	Enye nusianu si ƒo ƒu wɔ nye agbe la ƒe akpa sue aɖe.
I am planning on that tomorrow.	Mele ɖoɖo wɔm ɖe ema ŋu etsɔ.
And it’s not dead.	Eye menye kuku o.
I tried hard to find us a room	Medze agbagba vevie be madi xɔ aɖe na mí
There is no place for this now.	Teƒe aɖeke meli na esia fifia o.
This is so far from the truth.	Esia didi tso nyateƒea gbɔ ale gbegbe.
I have nothing to say	Nya aɖeke mele asinye magblɔ o
Closer than ever.	Te ɖe eŋu wu tsã.
I don’t want to leave my room	Nyemedi be mado le nye xɔ me o
But this morning has been anticipated for too long.	Gake wole mɔ kpɔm na ŋdi sia ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
But that’s not much help.	Gake ema menye kpekpeɖeŋu boo aɖeke o.

Each of us is different.	Mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe to vovo.

At that point in time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me.

There are many reasons for this	Susu geɖe tae esia dzɔ ɖo

Now listen carefully.	Azɔ ɖo to nyuie.
I want to move forward.	Medi be mayi ŋgɔ.

About an hour.	Anɔ abe gaƒoƒo ɖeka ene.

He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
In my heart there was no room for anyone else.	Le nye dzi me la, teƒe aɖeke menɔ anyi na ame bubu aɖeke o.
It started off pretty well.	Edze egɔme nyuie ŋutɔ.
If only it could have been me, though	Ne ɖe wòate ŋu anye nye ŋutɔ, gake

He will not act shortly.	Mawɔ nu kpuie o.
He couldn’t find any.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeke ŋu o.
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
He could have treated her better.	Ate ŋu awɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu nyuie hafi.

A place to do what he likes.	Teƒe si wòawɔ nusi dze eŋu.

I just need more time, a little more time	Ðeko mehiã ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu, ɣeyiɣi geɖe wu vie

It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.

He did not ask many questions about this	Mebia nya geɖe tso nya sia ŋu o
I just didn’t know people had heard of us	Ðeko nyemenya be amewo se mía ŋkɔ kpɔ o
I am the intact one.	Nyee nye ame si me gblẽ o.

Not with the police.	Menye kple kpovitɔwo o.

My head just went back.	Ðeko nye ta trɔ yi megbe.
Really damaged homes are a matter of life and death.	Aƒe siwo gblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ nye agbe kple ku ƒe nya.
He did not touch them or speak to them.	Meka asi wo ŋu alo ƒo nu na wo o.

The following two are relevant.	Eve siwo gbɔna la sɔ.

But.	Gake.
I think it’s very real	Mesusu be enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ŋutɔ
I had no idea why I was there	Nyemekpɔ susu si tae meli ɖo la dze sii kura o
And he doesn’t trust anyone he doesn’t know.	Eye meka ɖe ame aɖeke si menya o dzi o.
I promise, it’s not you, it’s me.	Medo ŋugbe be, menye wòe o, nyee.

No one did anything.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ naneke o.

He couldn’t allow that.	Mete ŋu ɖe mɔ nenema o.

I want to know what’s going on.	Medi be manya nusi le edzi yim.
See what you’re about to do.	Kpɔ nu si wɔ ge nèle la ɖa.

Nor could he hear her voice.	Eye mete ŋu se eƒe gbe hã o.

Can't 'wear that.	Mate ŋu 'ado ema o.
I just want you to have a normal life	Ðeko medi be agbe si sɔ nanɔ asiwò
You can try another project.	Àte ŋu ate dɔ bubu aɖe kpɔ.
We have to do something, but we don’t know what to do.	Ele be míawɔ nane, gake míenya nusi míawɔ o.
From person to person.	Tso ame dzi yi ame dzi.
I am on a two day diet	Mele ŋkeke eve ƒe nuɖuɖu dzi
They are waiting hand and foot.	Wole lalam asi kple afɔ.
It looks really great.	Edze abe gã ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.

I couldn’t hold myself back	Nyemete ŋu lé ɖokuinye ɖe te o
I needed a week.	Mehiã kwasiɖa ɖeka.
No one will know.	Ame aɖeke manya o.
Last year, something happened.	Le ƒe si va yi me la, nane dzɔ.
I couldn’t deny it that night	Nyemate ŋu agbe nu le eŋu le zã ma me o
We need to work on this together.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ tso esia ŋu ɖekae.
I have a plan for next year	Mewɔ ɖoɖo ɖe ƒe si gbɔna ŋu
He has no one.	Ame aɖeke mele esi o.
A lot of things came to mind.	Nu geɖe va nɔ susu me nam.
I can’t live without you	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe wò manɔmee o
I named him after a bone in his foot	Metsɔ ƒu aɖe si le eƒe afɔ ŋu ƒe ŋkɔ nɛ
These are good people.	Ame nyui siawo nye.
I can’t do that on my own	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema le ɖokuinye si o
Just for the sake of clarity.	Le eme kɔ nyuie ta ko.
Whatever you like.	Nusianu si dze ŋuwò.
It’s way too much.	Enye mɔ si gbɔ eme.
I would love to know how they are doing	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be manya alesi wole
I am very happy with my life.	Nye agbe dze ŋunye nyuie ŋutɔ.
I didn’t want to know what was going on	Nyemedi be manya nu si nɔ edzi yim o
I think you have people in mind	Mesusu be amewo le susu me na wò
Not now.	Menye fifia o.
I would be fine now	Anye ne nye lãme anɔ nyuie fifia
They have no teeth.	Aɖu mele wo si o.
Always.	Ɣesiaɣi.
I can do this for you	Mate ŋu awɔ esia na wò
That sounds like a good idea to me.	Ema ɖi susu nyui aɖe nam.
As it stands, right now.	Abe alesi wòle, fifia ene.
I’m not trying to do anything	Menye ɖe mele agbagba dzem be mawɔ naneke o
But he will never see anything.	Gake naneke makpɔ gbeɖe o.
There are at least two reasons for this.	Susu eve ya teti tae wòle alea ɖo.
I told them all about it	Megblɔ wo katã na wo
Not quite right yet.	Menye nusi sɔ tututu haɖe o.
I deserve everything you have and more	Medze na nusianu si le asiwò kple bubu geɖe
I had nothing and no one in my life	Naneke menɔ asinye o eye ame aɖeke hã menɔ asinye le nye agbe me o
You do your job.	Wòe wɔa wò dɔ.
Many people have people use them	Ame geɖe na amewo zã wo
But he will surely do so.	Gake awɔe nenema godoo.
It seems so simple.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe ene.
I will do anything for you.	Mawɔ nu sia nu na wò.
Nothing was ever the same.	Naneke menɔ abe tsã ene kpɔ o.
I could have fought it	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔ avu kplii hafi
He couldn’t tell her that.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nya ma nɛ o.
This made me happy.	Esia na mekpɔ dzidzɔ.
This is really good.	Esia nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You probably know what this means.	Ðewohĩ ènya nusi esia fia.
I can’t bear to let go	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi be maɖe asi le eŋu o
I honestly don’t know about them	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nu tso wo ŋu o
I am one of them now	Menye wo dometɔ ɖeka fifia
He never liked that part of his job.	Eƒe dɔa ƒe akpa ma medze eŋu kpɔ o.
But there may be another truth.	Gake nyateƒe bubu aɖe ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
People just don’t have much time for that.	Ðeko ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele amewo si ɖe ema ŋu o.
I want to share some good news.	Medi be magblɔ nya nyui aɖewo na amewo.
Nothing is more important than that.	Naneke mele vevie wu ema o.
It was a face with a job to do.	Enye mo si ŋu dɔ aɖe le be wòawɔ.
I understand this language well	Mese gbe sia gɔme nyuie
None of them are true.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menye nyateƒe o.
In fact, he was very tired at that point.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖeɖi te eŋu ŋutɔ le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
I want my people to live	Medi be nye amewo nanɔ agbe
I got really excited	Meva nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ
Which finally stopped.	Nusi va tɔ mlɔeba.
The work is no small feat.	Dɔa menye nu sue aɖeke o.
By itself means any attribute.	Le eɖokui si fia nɔnɔme ɖesiaɖe.
I was there last year	Menɔ afima le ƒe si va yi me
And, this is just one job.	Eye, dɔ ɖeka koe nye esia.
There was still much to be done.	Nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ nɔ anyi siwo wòle be woawɔ.
I wonder why that is.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae wòle nenema hã.
But something is going right.	Gake nane le edzi yim nyuie.
I had a lot of work to do today.	Dɔ geɖe nɔ asinye mawɔ egbea.

And it pleased him, too.	Eye edze eya hã ŋu.
There are two mechanisms.	Mɔ̃ eve aɖewo li.
A very good quality.	Nɔnɔme nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can see farther now	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu didi wu fifia
I don’t want to know anything else	Nyemedi be manya nu bubu aɖeke o
There is life among them.	Agbe le wo dome.
I needed it, of course.	Mehiã ya.
I felt there was a great deal missing in this	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nu gã aɖe bu le esia me
In fact, he probably doesn’t know who he is.	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ menya amesi wònye o.
You know what, it doesn’t really matter.	Ènya nusi, mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
The house is beautiful.	Aƒea nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
These things happened.	Nu siawo dzɔ.
I might try that again	Mate ŋu ate ema kpɔ ake
He is doing well.	Ele edzi dzem nyuie.

I decided to keep going	Meɖoe be mayi edzi
I didn't want to be too orderly	Nyemedi be mawɔ nu ɖe ​​ɖoɖo nu akpa o
I don’t know where he is	Nyemenya afi si wòle o
I have to do it with something good	Ele be mawɔe kple nu nyui aɖe
And it’s not that much.	Eye menye nenema gbegbe o.
I can work with that.	Mate ŋu awɔ dɔ kple ema.
I could have let it go.	Anye ne mate ŋu aɖe asi le eŋu hafi.
It felt like nothing.	Ewɔ nam abe naneke meli o ene.
Right in his face.	Le eƒe mo tututu.
These men know each other well.	Ŋutsu siawo nya wo nɔewo nyuie.
I couldn’t answer and I don’t know	Nyemete ŋu ɖo eŋu o eye nyemenya o

That was nearly two years ago.	Ema nye ƒe eve kloe enye sia.

Which ones are good for him.	Wo dometɔ siwo le nyuie nɛ.
I haven’t quite managed it yet	Nyemete ŋu ɖu edzi nyuie haɖe o
And it is very true that you can.	Eye enye nyateƒe ŋutɔ be àte ŋui.

I stayed there for days and saw everything	Menɔ afima ŋkeke geɖe eye mekpɔ nusianu
I don't know what's with this	Nyemenya nusi le esia ŋu o
Someone must have dropped something.	Ame aɖe anya da nane ɖi.
We are definitely ready.	Míele klalo godoo.
A little goes a long way	Vi aɖe koe wɔa nu geɖe ŋutɔ
Maybe this was once a mistake.	Ðewohĩ vodada aɖee esia nye tsã.

Lots of them, anyway	Wo dometɔ geɖe, le mɔ sia mɔ nu
I was almost dressed.	Medo awu kloe.
That’s the one.	Emae nye esi.

It’s not a surprise.	Menye nusi wɔ nuku o.

I just asked you that	Ðeko mebia wò nenema
There was no one else, and no money.	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ anyi o, eye ga hã menɔ anyi o.
But he was also concerned about his own work.	Gake eya ŋutɔ ƒe dɔ hã te ɖe edzi.
I guess not everything is normal	Mesusu be menye nusianu si sɔ gbɔ o
Which is the truth.	Nusi nye nyateƒe.
I can’t allow that	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ nenema o
I can be light as air	Mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe abe ya ene
And now, of course.	Eye fifia ya.
Speak your voice.	Gblɔ wò gbe.
Each room is at least a thousand feet long.	Xɔ ɖesiaɖe didi afɔ akpe ɖeka ya teti.
There is nothing wrong with it.	Naneke mele eŋu o.
But there is a reason for that.	Gake susu aɖe li si tae wòle nenema ɖo.
But he won’t do that.	Gake mawɔe nenema o.
I got a good look at the dog	Mekpɔ avu la nyuie
But he couldn’t stop either.	Gake eya hã mete ŋu tɔ te o.
I did let go of it.	Meɖe asi le eŋu nyateƒe.
It’s a difficult issue.	Enye nya sesẽ aɖe.
I don’t know this.	Nyemenya esia o.
I just trusted myself	Ðeko meka ɖe ɖokuinye dzi
There was nothing.	Naneke menɔ anyi o.
I know what he did to you	Menya nu si wòwɔ ɖe ŋuwò
I am already giving up.	Mele asi ɖem le nu ŋu xoxo.
Not in this case.	Menye le esia me o.
I have to have his attention	Ele nam be eƒe susu nanɔ ŋunye
Not for me and not for you.	Menye na nye o eye menye na wò hã o.
And act strongly.	Eye nàwɔ nu sesĩe.
I was too worried about it	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu akpa
I exposed too much	Meɖe nu geɖe ɖe go akpa
This will not be easy.	Esia manɔ bɔbɔe o.
It could have been that way.	Ate ŋu anɔ nenema hafi.
You do have a valid point.	Nya aɖe si sɔ le asiwò nyateƒe.

That’s important here.	Ema le vevie le afisia.
I thought it was amazing	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ
He’s always focused.	Eƒe susu nɔa nu ŋu ɣesiaɣi.
At least that night.	Zã ma ya teti.
I was getting the whole thing to myself	Menɔ nya bliboa ƒo ge ɖe ɖokuinye me
I still don’t know how to get out	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ ado le eme haɖe o
He did his part.	Ewɔ eƒe akpa dzi.

Where you are at all times is very important.	Afisi nèle ɣesiaɣi la le vevie ŋutɔ.
That’s four times as long as a dog.	Ema didi wu avu ƒe teƒe ene.
I could have finished a lot sooner	Anye ne mate ŋu awu enu kaba ŋutɔ hafi
Now he was tired.	Fifia ya ɖeɖi te eŋu.
In fact, it was a surprise.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I got this job for you.	Mexɔ dɔ sia na wò.
He shouldn’t have done that.	Mele be wòawɔ nu ma o.

He didn’t let go of my hand.	Meɖe asi le nye asi ŋu o.

I never actually saw them in action.	Nyemekpɔ wo wole dɔ wɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o.

I will do it now.	Mawɔe azɔ.
But I certainly heard about it	Gake mese nu tso eŋu godoo
But still, it’s impossible.	Gake ke hã, manya wɔ o.
So is everyone else.	Nenema ke ame sia ame hã le.

It’s really important that I know everything now	Ele vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ be manya nusianu fifia
Now, of course.	Fifia ya.

He is not angry with you.	Medo dziku ɖe ŋuwò o.

They were very excited.	Dzi dzɔ wo ŋutɔ.

Much work is still needed.	Dɔ geɖe gakpɔtɔ hiã.
But it could have been my imagination.	Gake ate ŋu anye nye susu me nuwo hafi.

I needed to do it.	Ehiã be mawɔe.
I really need help that will help me	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu si akpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ

It was a surprise to us.	Ewɔ nuku na mí ŋutɔ.

It looks very good.	Edze nyuie ŋutɔ.
I felt like something was on me	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nane le dzinye

The first of the night.	Zã la ƒe gbãtɔ.

But something caught his eye.	Gake nane lé eƒe ŋku.

Honestly, I wasn’t surprised at all	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔ nuku nam kura o

He could never find her.	Mete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu gbeɖe o.

I couldn’t focus on anything that night	Nyemete ŋu tsɔ nye susu ɖo naneke ŋu le zã ma me o
I have a job to do, and so do you	Dɔ aɖe le asinye mawɔ, eye wò hã nèle nenema
I gave him permission, of course	Meɖe mɔ nɛ ya
That can be useful.	Ema ate ŋu aɖe vi.
I see you have been looking at the house	Mekpɔ be èle aƒea me kpɔm kpɔ
I was just interested in that.	Ðeko metsɔ ɖe le nya ma me.
This is very difficult.	Esia sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t think of them	Nyemete ŋu bu wo ŋu o
It can definitely go on from there.	Ate ŋu ayi edzi tso afima godoo.
Maybe, maybe not.	Ate ŋu anye, ɖewohĩ manɔ nenema o.
Tell me more about this man.	Gblɔ nu geɖe nam tso ŋutsu sia ŋu.
I think everyone probably has.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ amesiame le esi.
A great time was had by all.	Ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe nɔ amewo katã si.
I want to talk to you.	Medi be maƒo nu kpli wò.
I’m not there right now.	Nyemele afima fifia o.
I get angry as easily as that	Medo dziku bɔbɔe abe ema ene
I could definitely keep going	Mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim godoo
I had to do what was right for him	Ele be mawɔ nu si sɔ nɛ
This isn’t the case either.	Esia hã mele eme o.
I might as well have nothing on	Ðewohĩ anyo be naneke manɔ ŋunye o
I know you have them in mind	Menya be wo le susu me na wò
Car.	Ʋu.
I know what night it was.	Menya zã ka me.
And this morning.	Eye ŋdi sia.
There are two drawbacks.	Nu eve aɖewo gblẽ le eŋu.
That’s not much help.	Ema menye kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe o.
I can’t stay there for too long	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afima ɣeyiɣi didi akpa o
I think that’s all you have to do	Mesusu be ema koe nye nusi wòle be nàwɔ
I may not have time to do it tomorrow	Ðewohĩ ɣeyiɣi manɔ asinye mawɔe etsɔ o
It was as if someone had kicked me.	Ðeko wòle abe ame aɖe ƒo afɔ nam ene.
I need that done soon	Mehiã be woawɔ ema kpuie
Some of these things are very expensive	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖewo xɔ asi ŋutɔ
The kind who knows who he is.	Ame si ƒomevi nya amesi wònye.
There will be no problems at all.	Kuxi aɖeke manɔ anyi kura o.
There is no mountain for that.	To aɖeke meli na ema o.
I probably already told you about that part	Anɔ eme be megblɔ akpa ma ŋu nya na mi xoxo
I lost another house.	Aƒe bubu aɖe bu nam.
I couldn’t have done it without you	Nyemate ŋu awɔe wò manɔmee o
I think it’s a system.	Mesusu be enye ɖoɖo aɖe.
Can't you understand it's you.	Ðe màte ŋu ase egɔme be wòe.
Believe me, it’s none of your business.	Xɔ dzinye se, menye wò nya aɖeke o.
That’s all it could have been.	Ema koe nye nusi wòate ŋu anye hafi.
Home is after all where the heart is	Aƒe nye afisi dzi le le nyateƒe me
This thing did that.	Nu sia wɔe nenema.
But this day was different.	Gake ŋkeke sia ya to vovo.
In the near future.	Le etsɔ si gbɔna kpuie me.
There is no problem here.	Kuxi aɖeke mele afisia o.
It’s just wrong.	Ðeko wònye nu gbegblẽ.
And we can never get close to it.	Eye míate ŋu ate ɖe eŋu gbeɖe o.
An idea came to him	Susu aɖe va susu me nɛ
I need you to do something	Mehiã be nàwɔ nane
I can’t let that be done to you	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ woawɔ nu ma ɖe ŋuwò o
I had no problem with that	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ ŋunye le nya ma ŋu o
I also had to make a few other calls	Ele be maƒo ka bubu ʋɛ aɖewo hã
I understand it now.	Mese egɔme azɔ.
I decided to try anyway	Meɖoe be mate kpɔ le mɔ sia mɔ nu
I need to find a horse	Ele be madi sɔ aɖe
I guess he didn’t always know what	Mesusu be menya nusi ɣesiaɣi o
The person who filed the complaint.	Ame si tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu.
Or everything is like that.	Alo nusianu le nenema.
I don’t know what else to tell you	Nyemenya nya bubu aɖeke magblɔ na mi o
More help is on the way.	Kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe wu le mɔ dzi gbɔna.
I thought everyone was going to die	Mesusu be amesiame le kuku ge
I couldn’t imagine what was in it	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi le eme la le susu me o
And it’s there.	Eye wòle afima.
As a matter of fact, now.	Abe nyateƒe ene, fifia.
He needed that car.	Ehiã ʋu ma.
He has a house.	Aƒe le esi.
I just want to get to know you better	Ðeko medi be manya wò nyuie wu
This is true in every respect.	Esia nye nyateƒe le go sia go me.
Again, no major problem.	Le afisia hã la, kuxi gã aɖeke meli o.
However, few people can survive without additional help.	Ke hã, ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe ate ŋu anɔ agbe kpekpeɖeŋu bubu manɔmee.
I can’t save everyone	Nyemate ŋu aɖe ame sia ame o
I just couldn’t be happier	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ wu ema o
I’ve found it.	Meke ɖe eŋu.
It doesn’t matter.	Mehiã o.
And yet a great opportunity presented itself	Eye ke hã mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe va do mo ɖa
He didn’t do that, of course.	Mewɔe nenema o ya.
I already felt too bad	Mese le ɖokuinye me xoxo be nye lãme gblẽ akpa
Many, many hours.	Gaƒoƒo geɖe, geɖe.
I have another reason.	Susu bubu aɖe hã le asinye.
I heard you for the first time	Mese wò zi gbãtɔ
I will command and they will do it	Maɖe gbe eye woawɔ ɖe edzi
I have told you this	Megblɔ nya sia na mi
I don’t want to end up like him	Nyemedi be mava nɔ abe eya ene mlɔeba o
And of course it isn’t.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, mele eme o.
Each of us must make our own way through life.	Ele be mía dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe nawɔ eya ŋutɔ ƒe mɔ to agbe me.
Our house is small.	Míaƒe aƒea le sue.
I work so much better this way	Mewɔa dɔ nyuie wu ale gbegbe le mɔ sia nu
Good night everyone!.	Zã nyui na amesiame!.
I needed to act quickly.	Ehiã be mawɔ nu kaba.
This is not life.	Esia menye agbe o.
You’re running with your dog.	Èle du dzi kple wò avu.
He was happy now, very happy.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ azɔ, edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t leave.	Nyemete ŋu dzo o.
No one should have to do it all on their own.	Mele be ame aɖeke nawɔ wo katã le eɖokui si o.
There must be something more we can do.	Ele be nane nanɔ anyi geɖe wu si míate ŋu awɔ.
I was trying so hard	Menɔ agbagba dzem vevie ale gbegbe
It was very impressive	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
Take his own life.	Ðe eya ŋutɔ ƒe agbe ɖa.
I think that needs some work	Mesusu be ema hiã dɔ aɖewo wɔwɔ
Too good a man to do that.	Ŋutsu nyui akpa be wòawɔ ema.
But this isn’t really surprising.	Gake esia mewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Some things are more interesting to me.	Nu aɖewo doa dzidzɔ nam wu.
And that in everyone else.	Eye be le ame bubu ɖesiaɖe si.
I’ve improved a little bit.	Me nyo ɖe edzi vie.
I need to find a new job	Ele be madi dɔ yeye aɖe
I remember it like it was yesterday	Meɖo ŋku edzi abe etsɔ ene
Personally, I couldn’t see a problem with this	Nye ŋutɔ nyemete ŋu kpɔ kuxi aɖeke le esia ŋu o
I don’t know at all.	Nyemenya kura o.
I was able to control myself	Mete ŋu ɖu ɖokuinye dzi
It may be, of course.	Ate ŋu anɔ nenema ya.
I can’t help but find myself in a small mistake	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke wu be makpɔ ɖokuinye le vodada sue aɖe me o
Everyone should do their job.	Ame sia ame nawɔ eƒe dɔ.
A few of them were expecting him	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ eƒe mɔ kpɔm
I can’t let him do this	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ nɛ wòawɔ esia o
This is just not what happened here.	Ðeko esia menye nusi dzɔ le afisia o.
And he doesn’t want that either.	Eye medi nenema hã o.
He can do this.	Ate ŋu awɔ esia.
I should have told you everything	Ðe wòle be magblɔ nya sia nya na wò hafi
One does not know the consequences of doing so	Ame menya nu siwo ado tso esia wɔwɔ me o
I don’t think they’re going to get any of us.	Nyemesusu be wole mía dometɔ aɖeke xɔ ge o.
I hope you enjoy it.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò.
I didn’t want to explain things to him	Nyemedi be maɖe nuwo me nɛ o
We are one.	Míenye ɖeka.
In reality, however, this is not the case.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, esia mele alea o.
It didn’t work well.	Mewɔ dɔ nyuie o.
Some parts are missing.	Akpa aɖewo bu.
I never imagined anything like it	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene le susu me kpɔ o
Perhaps you can explain that.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu aɖe nya ma me.
No one knows who that is.	Ame aɖeke menya amesi ema nye o.
He can’t go on without me.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi nye manɔmee o.
He is in the car.	Ele ʋua me.
I did that for you	Mewɔ nu ma na wò
The apartment was amazing.	Xɔa me wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He always had a strategy.	Aɖaŋu aɖe nɔa esi ɣesiaɣi.
I should have said more	Ðe wòle be magblɔ nya geɖe hafi
I can’t remember a time when I wasn’t there	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku ɣeyiɣi aɖe si me menɔ afima o la dzi o
The strange figure was in front.	Ame si ƒe nɔnɔme wɔ nuku la nɔ ŋgɔ.
Many men wear guns	Ŋutsu geɖe doa tu
I could hear his mind speaking	Mese eƒe susu nɔ nu ƒom
Which, of course, takes a very long time.	Nusi, le nyateƒe me, xɔa ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ.
I know it will be your making	Menya be anye wò wɔwɔ
Or for me.	Alo na nye.
I just hope he comes to his senses soon	Ðeko mele mɔ kpɔm be eƒe susu ava kpuie
I have some great men in my life.	Ŋutsu gã aɖewo le asinye le nye agbe me.
I just told them what happened	Ðeko megblɔ nusi dzɔ la na wo
That’s just part of it.	Ema nye eƒe akpa aɖe ko.
I'm not sure exactly what this means	Nyemeka ɖe nusi tututu esia fia dzi o
Make yourself very comfortable.	Na wò dzi dze eme ŋutɔ.
I lived for a very long time.	Menɔ agbe ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ.
I made a lot of mistakes	Mewɔ vodada geɖe
I didn’t get enough of it last time	Nyemekpɔ eƒe nu sɔ gbɔ zi mamlɛtɔ o
He didn’t give us a last name.	Metsɔ ŋkɔ mamlɛtɔ na mí o.
I think it’s probably a good idea.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ enye susu nyui aɖe.
No one ever does this.	Ame aɖeke mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
Not sure what to do with it	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ kplii dzi o
But there is nothing to do.	Gake naneke meli woawɔ o.
I know what that means	Menya nusi ema fia
The whole thing changed for us.	Nu bliboa trɔ na mí.
Tom, on the other hand, wasn’t quite sure.	Tom ya meka ɖe edzi tututu o.
I know what the car can do.	Menya nusi ʋua ate ŋu awɔ.
They seemed to like it.	Edze abe edzɔ dzi na wo ene.
I can’t stand it at all	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu kura o
Some people are different	Ame aɖewo to vovo
But last night.	Gake le zã si va yi me.
He has blood on him now.	Ʋu le eŋu fifia.
That is the real reality.	Emae nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si li ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It didn’t last long	Menɔ anyi eteƒe didi o
I should be doing more	Ele be manɔ nu geɖe wu wɔm
I should have called you earlier	Ðe wòle be maƒo ka na wò do ŋgɔ hafi
It’s clear to me now.	Eme kɔ nam fifia.
I am right here.	Mele afisia tututu.
I’m probably not doing the right thing.	Anɔ eme be nyemele nu nyui wɔm o.
I looked away from them	Meɖe ŋku ɖa le wo ŋu
I can’t do that.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema o.
A stone slipped from under his feet	Kpe aɖe ƒo tso eƒe afɔ te
I was nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe.
Maybe a deserted road.	Ðewohĩ mɔ si dzi ame aɖeke mele o.
I couldn’t put them together	Nyemete ŋu ƒo wo nu ƒu o
But he was definitely a man with a plan in his life.	Gake enye ŋutsu aɖe si si ɖoɖo le le eƒe agbe me godoo.
I don’t have any teeth yet	Nyemekpɔ aɖu aɖeke haɖe o
I can’t accept this	Nyemate ŋu axɔ esia o
Maybe he had a little one by now.	Ðewohĩ vi aɖe nɔ esi vaseɖe fifia.
I really, really want this guy.	Medi ŋutsu sia ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That would be something new.	Ema anye nu yeye aɖe.
I just should have been there	Ðeko wòle be manɔ afima hafi
But I do know what to expect	Gake nye ya menya nusi makpɔ mɔ na
I entrust every aspect of this day to you	Metsɔ ŋkeke sia ƒe akpa sia akpa de asi na mi
I can’t do anything about that.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso ema ŋu o.
It is very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ.
They had water but no food.	Tsi nɔ wo si gake nuɖuɖu aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
I'm still in the clothes I wore last night	Megale awu siwo medo le zã si va yi me la me kokoko
In fact, more than twice.	Le nyateƒe me la, wu zi eve.
I was so sick of it	Medze dɔ ale gbegbe le esia ta
I can’t explain it with any reason.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eme kple susu aɖeke o.
I have absolutely no idea what that is	Nyemenya nusi ema nye kura o
He seemed satisfied.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme ene.
There is another issue.	Nya bubu aɖe hã li.
I had no idea it would come to this	Nyemenya kura be ava ɖo esia gbɔ o
This was a great moment for me .	Esia nye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe nam .
But it will work overnight.	Gake awɔ dɔ zã ɖeka.
And that means something.	Eye ema fia nane.
That felt personal.	Ema se le eɖokui me be ye ŋutɔ tɔ.
I had been hoping to find some clothes	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm tsã be makpɔ awu aɖewo
This can be annoying.	Esia ate ŋu ado dziku na ame.
I did the same thing, too	Nye hã mewɔ nu ma ke
I think he would have understood	Mesusu be anye ne ase egɔme hafi
I haven’t seen one that bad, if anything.	Nyemekpɔ ɖeka aɖeke si gblẽ ale gbegbe, ne ele nenema la, o.
One way or another.	Mɔ aɖe alo bubu aɖe nu.
I am so glad this place exists	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be teƒe sia li
Maybe I was talking to myself.	Ðewohĩ nyee nɔ nu ƒom na ɖokuinye.
Living alone in a house.	Alesi nye ɖeka manɔ aƒe aɖe me.
I also have a few things	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo hã le asinye
I can’t remember anything	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku naneke dzi o
I can never get this last part right	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ akpa mamlɛtɔ sia nyuie gbeɖe o
Not that that matters at all.	Menye ɖe ema le vevie kura o.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
I am the truth.	Nyee nye nyateƒe.
The money was missing and no one knew where it was.	Ga la bu eye ame aɖeke menya afisi wòle o.
But you can do it as well.	Gake àte ŋu awɔe nenema ke.
I almost gave it all away	Metsɔ wo katã na kloe
I can’t explain that.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nya ma me o.
There were not many people there.	Ame geɖe menɔ afima o.
Listen to an excerpt here.	Se eƒe akpa aɖe le afisia.
I shouldn’t be so angry	Mele be mado dziku nenema gbegbe o
In fact, it is impossible.	Le nyateƒe me la, manya wɔ o.
On the same day.	Le ŋkeke ma ke dzi.
This requires money.	Esia bia ga.
This certainly should not be the case.	Mele be esia nanɔ alea godoo o.
None of you can do wrong.	Mi ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ nu gbegblẽ o.
Not sure what the big deal is	Nyemeka ɖe nusi nye nya gã la dzi o
But the reality is quite different.	Gake nu ŋutɔŋutɔ si le eme la to vovo kura.
I knew it would upset him	Menya be ado dziku nɛ
The process takes an hour.	Dɔa wɔwɔ xɔa gaƒoƒo ɖeka.
He didn’t know what he wanted.	Menya nusi dim wònɔ o.
We know very little about what happened.	Míenya nu boo aɖeke tso nu si dzɔ ŋu o.
I just got a job there	Ðeko mekpɔ dɔ le afima
I can’t do it on my own.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe le ɖokuinye si o.
It didn’t feel like a good thing.	Mese le eɖokui me be enye nu nyui aɖeke o.
I couldn’t find our room	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe míaƒe xɔa ŋu o
I make us breakfast	Mewɔa ŋdi nuɖuɖu na mí
That is, .	Ema nye, .
That’s very, very important.	Ema le vevie ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
It just isn’t.	Ðeko mele nenema o.
Another was on the way.	Bubu hã nɔ mɔ dzi.
I've heard one lie too many.	Mese alakpa ɖeka sɔ gbɔ akpa kpɔ.
Another ran at me.	Bubu hã ƒu du ɖe ŋunye.
He did a lot of great things.	Ewɔ nu gã geɖe.
I know this will happen	Menya be esia ava eme
I think he's trying	Mesusu be ele agbagba dzem
And he didn’t either.	Eye eya hã mewɔe nenema o.
All of his people did that.	Eƒe amewo katã wɔe nenema.
I could see this too	Mete ŋu kpɔ esia hã
There is no privileged structure.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ ƒe ɖoɖo aɖeke meli o.
I needed something more	Mehiã nane si de ŋgɔ wu ema
Which is very surprising.	Nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He is working on a good case.	Ele dɔ wɔm le nya nyui aɖe ŋu.
What he had.	Nusi nɔ esi.
However, that’s between him and the police.	Ke hã, ema le eya kple kpovitɔwo dome.
I don’t know anything about this.	Nyemenya naneke tso esia ŋu o.
Again, it’s awesome.	Le afisia hã la, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Glad to hear that.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mese nya ma.
I desperately needed blood	Mehiã ʋu vevie ŋutɔ
Some other things, too.	Nu bubu aɖewo hã.
But we seem to be on it.	Gake edze abe míele edzi ene.
This is more than that.	Esia sɔ gbɔ wu ema.
I can’t get any right now.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ ɖeke fifia o.
And nothing works.	Eye naneke mewɔa dɔ o.
I’ve never really lived alone	Nye ɖeka menɔ agbe ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o
I set just a few rules	Se ʋɛ aɖewo koe meɖo
No one said it would be easy.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ be anɔ bɔbɔe o.
I think you might be the problem	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ wòe nye kuxi
It’s by no means a rule, but it’s a trend.	Menye se aɖeke kura o, gake enye nusi le edzi yim.
But only a few days before his .	Gake ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe do ŋgɔ na eƒe .
I want to get out of here	Medi be mado le afisia
None of us know.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke menya o.
Fire never caught fire.	Dzo mexɔ dzo gbeɖe o.
Consider the following scheme.	Bu ɖoɖo si gbɔna ŋu kpɔ.
I didn’t know he was here	Nyemenya be ele afisia o
I hope you really enjoy it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be adzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔŋutɔ
There was really nothing anyone could do for him.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke menɔ anyi si ame aɖe ate ŋu awɔ nɛ o.
The teacher didn’t understand.	Nufiala la mese egɔme o.
Two-fourths in error.	Eve le ene me le vodada me.
Some parts make perfect sense.	Akpa aɖewo me susu le kura.
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
I will tell you this too	Magblɔ nya sia na mi hã
And that’s good for me.	Eye esia nyo nam.
This brings to mind two ideas.	Esia na susu eve aɖewo va susu me na mí.
Another very difficult thing.	Nu bubu si sesẽ ŋutɔ.
It was a huge mistake	Vodada gã aɖee wònye
I don’t think you can.	Nyemesusu be àte ŋui o.
I have to explain what ultimately happened.	Ele be maɖe nusi dzɔ mlɔeba la me.
I asked a lot of them	Mebia nu geɖe tso wo si
I was fighting for my life	Menɔ avu wɔm ɖe nye agbe ta
I met a guy.	Medo go ŋutsu aɖe.
I think you already know that	Mesusu be ènya esia xoxo
But his mind was very busy.	Gake vovo menɔ eƒe susu ŋu ŋutɔ.
You can’t see things easily.	Màte ŋu akpɔ nuwo bɔbɔe o.
People are angry.	Amewo doa dziku.
I would have married you	Anye ne meɖe wò hafi
Everything for two now.	Nusianu na ame eve fifia.
However, it is important to emphasize the following points.	Ke hã, ele vevie be míate gbe ɖe nya siwo gbɔna dzi.
This surprised many.	Esia wɔ nuku na ame geɖe.
Or something is going to go wrong.	Alo nane le gbegblẽ ge.
His voice sounded different.	Eƒe gbe ɖi to vovo.
He had to make his way.	Ele be wòawɔ eƒe mɔ.
That is such a rookie mistake.	Ema nye ame yeye ƒe vodada ale gbegbe.
I want to know everything now	Medi be manya nusianu fifia
There is a time though.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe li ke hã.
Stand at one foot.	Tsi tre ɖe afɔ ɖeka gbɔ.
I have done that in the past.	Mewɔe nenema va yi.
However, he didn’t.	Ke hã, mewɔe nenema o.
There are always exceptions.	Ame aɖewo li siwo to vovo ɣesiaɣi.
I tried my best to stay that way	Medze agbagba ɖesiaɖe be manɔ nenema
He got sick this time.	Edze dɔ zi sia.
I must have made a mistake	Anɔ eme be mewɔ vodada
The truth was more interesting.	Nyateƒea do dzidzɔ na ame wu.
I don’t know what to make of this	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso esia ŋu o
Just tell us where it is.	Ðeko nàgblɔ afisi wòle na mí.
But he had a reason.	Gake susu nɔ esi.
We are working in that direction.	Míele dɔ wɔm le mɔ ma nu.
I think there must have been something in his past	Mesusu be nane anya nɔ eƒe agbe si va yi me
They are doing a good job.	Wole dɔ nyui aɖe wɔm.

I wasn't talking to him, not now	Menye ɖe menɔ nu ƒom kplii o, menye fifia o
I was anxious to get out of here	Metsi dzi be mado le afisia
You don’t know what you’ve done.	Mènya nusi nèwɔ o.
But I could understand that	Gake mete ŋu se nya ma gɔme
That would be a few hours.	Ema anye gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo.
It can also protect them in the event of a problem.	Ate ŋu akpɔ wo ta hã ne kuxi aɖe do mo ɖa.
Get out of your own head.	Do go le wò ŋutɔ wò ta me.
I should have expected it.	Ðe wòle be makpɔ mɔ nɛ hafi.
It really doesn’t matter.	Le nyateƒe me la, mehiã o.

A man on his own.	Ŋutsu aɖe si le eɖokui si.
I’m not doing this for the money	Menye ga la tae mele esia wɔm ɖo o
And she made breakfast herself.	Eye eya ŋutɔ wɔ ŋdi nuɖuɖu.
Just not a little bit.	Ðeko menye nu sue aɖe ko o.
And there is no other.	Eye bubu aɖeke hã meli o.
It really is as simple as that.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
Just how much this would help them, he had no idea.	Alesi tututu esia akpe ɖe wo ŋui la, menya kura o.
I never liked that.	Nya ma medze ŋunye kpɔ o.
I hope you enjoy it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be dzi adzɔ wò
He had to comply with it.	Ele nɛ be wòawɔ ɖe edzi.
Neither of us said anything.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke megblɔ nya aɖeke o.
But this is a minor issue.	Gake nya sue aɖee nye esia.
Maybe that’s a good thing.	Ðewohĩ nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
Not hard for someone like him.	Menye nu sesẽ na ame aɖe abe eya ene o.
But there are two things that are totally missing here.	Gake nu eve aɖewo li siwo bu le afisia kura.
In fact, he didn’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔe nenema o.
I know you everywhere	Menya wò akpa sia akpa
I tried to talk to him	Medze agbagba be maƒo nu kplii
He didn’t refuse anything.	Megbe naneke o.
Maybe you don’t have one.	Ðewohĩ ɖeke mele asiwò o.
I would expect them to do that	Makpɔ mɔ be woawɔ ema
I gave up everything.	Meɖe asi le nusianu ŋu.
I need to have a clear mind.	Ele be susu si me kɔ nanɔ asinye.
But we’re not, really.	Gake míele nenema o, le nyateƒe me.
I'll see you in an hour or so	Makpɔ wò le gaƒoƒo ɖeka alo esi wu nenema megbe
I stayed like this for hours, until morning	Menɔ alea gaƒoƒo geɖe, vaseɖe ŋdi
But it wasn’t all that.	Gake menye ema koe wònye o.
This means the following.	Esia fia nya siwo gbɔna.
This is quite different.	Esia to vovo kura.
I have yet to witness anything like this	Nyemekpɔ naneke si sɔ kple esia teƒe haɖe o
I plan to do the same this year.	Meɖoe be mawɔ nenema ke le ƒe sia me hã.
It just can’t work.	Ðeko mete ŋu wɔa dɔ o.
I put my ear to his mouth	Metsɔ nye to ɖo eƒe nu gbɔ
Thank you for being there for me.	Akpe na wò be nèle afima nam.
I couldn’t get rid of them	Nyemete ŋu ɖe wo ɖa o
I wondered where he was	Mebia ɖokuinye be afikae wòle hã
One of them walked out of the room	Wo dometɔ ɖeka do go le xɔa me
I remember that drive-in, the first week	Meɖo ŋku ʋu ma si metsɔ va ʋu me dzi, le kwasiɖa gbãtɔ me
You might as well do that, anyway.	Àte ŋu awɔ ema nenema ke, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I was furious with him this morning	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu vevie ŋdi sia
Death or loss.	Ku alo bu.
It is also a comprehensive plan	Enye ɖoɖo si me nusianu le hã
Perhaps he was, too.	Ðewohĩ eya hã nɔ nenema.
And it’s pretty short.	Eye wòle kpuie ŋutɔ.
I had to see what happened	Ele be makpɔ nusi dzɔ
They had a lot in common.	Nu geɖe nɔ wo dome si sɔ kple wo nɔewo.
We are always looking for them.	Míele wo dim ɣesiaɣi.
Thank you for your attention and time.	Akpe na wò ɖe wò susu kple ɣeyiɣi ta.
It wasn’t always easy.	Menɔ bɔbɔe ɣesiaɣi o.
I needed to see someone I knew well	Ehiã be makpɔ ame aɖe si menya nyuie
It’s a first for you.	Enye gbãtɔ na wò.
It's a gun.	Enye tu.
I don’t really know them	Nyemenya wo ŋutɔŋutɔ o
Way more than you.	Mɔ geɖe wu wò.
That will work.	Ema awɔ dɔ.
I’m not quite sure	Nyemeka ɖe edzi tututu o
I did the same thing.	Nye hã mewɔe nenema ke.
Now we don’t know how to prove this.	Fifia míenya alesi míawɔ aɖo kpe esia dzi o.
He did everything he had to do.	Ewɔ nusianu si wòle be wòawɔ.
I almost didn’t want to	Nyemedi kloe o
I searched, but found nothing	Medi nu, gake nyemekpɔ naneke o
I never had time to do this	Nyemekpɔ ɣeyiɣi mawɔ esia kpɔ o
Today is no exception.	Egbea hã mele eme o.
Had it not been morning.	Ne ɖe menye ŋdi o la, anye ne mewɔe nenema o.
This is something that won’t usually happen.	Esia nye nusi mava eme zi geɖe o.
Please give us a call.	Taflatse ƒo ka na mí.
I have to hope he wasn't furious	Ele nam be makpɔ mɔ be medo dziku vevie o
A few times my mind was elsewhere	Zi ʋɛ aɖewo la, nye susu nɔ teƒe bubu
I can do whatever you want	Mate ŋu awɔ nusianu si nèdi
This is not exactly true.	Esia menye nyateƒe tututu o.
I need something better	Mehiã nane si nyo wu
So much more than that.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ wu ema.
I would love to know how it is	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be manya alesi wòle
This can happen for a number of reasons.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ le susu geɖe ta.
I knew it was impossible	Menya be manya wɔ o
That will happen in the next month or two.	Nu ma adzɔ le ɣleti ɖeka alo eve siwo gbɔna me.
It will not be going on in a smooth manner.	Manɔ edzi yim le ɖoɖo nu o.
The issue is more complicated.	Nya la sesẽ wu.
A place that used to be our home.	Teƒe si nye míaƒe aƒe tsã.
I reminded myself that it was only one day	Meɖo ŋku edzi na ɖokuinye be ŋkeke ɖeka koe nye ema
He will be with us.	Anɔ mía gbɔ.
Mele on the ge.	Mele ku ge.
A voice he barely recognized.	Gbe aɖe si mekpɔ dze sii tututu o.
That’s your opportunity.	Emae nye wò mɔnukpɔkpɔ.

You’ll be thrilled.	Adzɔ dzi na wò.
I have already said too much	Megblɔ nya geɖe akpa xoxo
Get one if you don’t have one.	Xɔ ɖeka ne ɖeke mele asiwò o.
I think it will do very well.	Mesusu be awɔe nyuie ŋutɔ.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe li siwo tae.
I think the reasons for that are obvious enough	Mesusu be susu siwo tae wòle nenema ɖo la dze ƒã ale gbegbe
It doesn’t matter.	Mele vevie o.
I’m not exactly like you	Nyemele abe wò ene tututu o
There must be more.	Ele be nu geɖe wu nanɔ anyi.
We have to be quick.	Ele be míawɔ kaba.
It’s a search process.	Enye didi ƒe ɖoɖo aɖe.
I am either doing this with you or you are not doing this	Mele esia wɔm kple wò alo mèle esia wɔm o
He can hear some kind of music.	Ate ŋu ase ha aɖe ƒomevi.
In short, the	Kpuie ko la le .
I am not going to let that be done to me.	Nyemele mɔ ɖe ge be woawɔ nu ma ɖe ŋunye o.
As a rule of thumb.	Abe se ene la.
It was like a part of him was sick too.	Ðeko wònɔ abe eƒe akpa aɖe hã dze dɔ ene.
But it didn’t come out.	Gake meva do o.
We will have nothing difficult to do.	Naneke sesẽ aɖeke manɔ mía si míawɔ o.
It might work the opposite way.	Ðewohĩ awɔ dɔ si to vovo na ema.
I just want to know.	Ðeko medi be manya.
We are acting as one.	Míele nu wɔm abe ɖeka ene.
Like something alive.	Abe nane si le agbe ene.
But he couldn’t be sure.	Gake mete ŋu ka ɖe edzi o.
I want to meet this kid	Medi be mado go ɖevi sia
I actually really liked this episode.	Le nyateƒe me la, akpa sia dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I'm trying to work on that.	Mele agbagba dzem be mawɔ dɔ tso ema ŋu.
I, of course, am interested in that	Nye ya, metsɔ ɖe le ema me ya
But the project never materialized.	Gake dɔa meva eme gbeɖe o.
Nothing really matters.	Naneke mele vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
We can help that way, a little bit.	Míate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu nenema, vie.
It’s nothing like fire.	Menye naneke si le abe dzo ene o.
I couldn’t stand them	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe wo nu o
At this point, you’ve got the job.	Le afisia la, wòe xɔ dɔa.

I couldn’t tell what his face looked like	Nyemete ŋu nya alesi eƒe mo nye o
I will call you soon!.	Maƒo ka na wò kpuie!.
I was on it now	Meva nɔ edzi azɔ
There is no reality.	Nu ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖeke meli o.
I think everyone else was too	Mesusu be ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã nɔ nenema
I will tell you everything that happened	Magblɔ nu sia nu si dzɔ la na wò
I have seen this before	Mekpɔ esia kpɔ do ŋgɔ
Work.	Dɔ.
I was a little worried	Metsi dzi vie
But it is quite the opposite.	Gake nusi to vovo kura na emae wònye.
I want to be ready if something happens	Medi be manɔ klalo ne nane dzɔ
This guy wasn’t doing that.	Ŋutsu sia menɔ ema wɔm o.
I don’t know what’s in it	Nyemenya nusi le eme o
That is very true.	Ema nye nyateƒe ŋutɔ.
I explained what had happened	Meɖe nusi dzɔ la me nɛ
I didn’t know how to react or what to say	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ nu alo nya si magblɔ o
Yet the reality is the same.	Ke hã nyateƒea le nenema.
I knew someone was going to say that	Menya be ame aɖe le nya ma gblɔ ge
I don’t want to continue that idea.	Nyemedi be mayi susu ma dzi o.
I am not sure of the worst case scenario	Nyemeka ɖe nɔnɔme si gblẽ wu dzi o
That was a little exciting	Ema do dzidzɔ nam vie
I can’t get that over my mind	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ema le nye susu dzi o
Obviously that will be part of it.	Edze ƒã be ema anye eƒe akpa aɖe.
People talk about things that aren’t there.	Amewo ƒoa nu tso nu siwo mele afima o ŋu.
I am the right person	Nyee nye ame si sɔ
I couldn’t see you at all	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ wò kura o
You think they are.	Èsusu be wole nenema.
It was hard and passionate work.	Enye dɔ sesẽ si me dzo le.
I can’t allow that.	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ ɖe ema ŋu o.
Please let me know if you have any questions.	Taflatse na manya ne nya aɖe le asiwò.
Maybe that couldn’t change it.	Ðewohĩ ema mete ŋu trɔ asi le eŋu o.
Now, just look at you.	Azɔ, kpɔ wò ko.
Take whatever you want.	Tsɔ nusianu si nèdi.
This is a huge problem.	Esia nye kuxi gã aɖe.
I couldn’t be happier.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ wu ema o.
We had two hours.	Gaƒoƒo eve nɔ mía si.
I just want to be with you	Ðeko medi be manɔ anyi kpli wò
And to ma is me.	Le go ma ke me.
We need to have a plan now.	Ele be ɖoɖo aɖe nanɔ mía si fifia.
I think you have a problem	Mesusu be kuxi aɖe le ŋuwò
I can do that with everyone in this town	Mate ŋu awɔ ema kple amesiame le du sia me
He never said that to her.	Megblɔ nya ma nɛ kpɔ o.
We have a job to do.	Dɔ aɖe le mía si míawɔ.
I would have fought it myself	Nye ŋutɔ hã mawɔ avu kplii hafi
I don’t know where you are or what happened	Nyemenya afi si nèle alo nu si dzɔ o
I knew this day would come	Menya be ŋkeke sia ava
I wondered if he was expecting more trouble	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe wòle mɔ kpɔm na kuxi geɖe wu hã
There is a great market.	Asi gã aɖe le afima.
You can go or you can stay.	Àte ŋu ayi alo àte ŋu anɔ anyi.
I can’t say what he wants	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi dim wòle o
Everyone knows this.	Amesiame nya esia.
Let me find the right word.	Mina madi nya si sɔ.
And maybe a lot more.	Eye ɖewohĩ nu geɖe wu hã.
I want to know them all	Medi be manya wo katã
Still, he can’t help himself.	Ke hã, mate ŋu akpe ɖe eɖokui ŋu o.
Things are broken.	Nuwo gblẽ.
This is a fairly new phenomenon.	Esia nye nu yeye aɖe ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t tell who was on which side	Nyemete ŋu nya amesi nɔ akpa ka dzi o
This is too late.	Esia tsi megbe akpa.
He was only one child.	Vi ɖeka koe wònye.
He would believe that.	Axɔ nya ma dzi ase.
Life was simple and very little had ever happened there.	Agbe nɔ bɔbɔe eye nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe dzɔ le afima kpɔ.
I don’t know this person	Nyemenya ame sia o
I really enjoy this.	Esia dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ.
That’s what he’s doing right there.	Emae nye nusi wɔm wòle le afima tututu.
Consider two possibilities.	Bu nu eve siwo ate ŋu adzɔ ŋu kpɔ.
There is no room for you here.	Teƒe aɖeke meli na wò le afisia o.
He put his hand on the dog’s head.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ɖo avu la ƒe ta dzi.
I was the only one in the room	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ xɔa me
I am cheering for him	Mele dzidzɔ kpɔm nɛ
In a few hours, she will be glad she didn’t.	Le gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo megbe la, adzɔ dzi nɛ be mewɔe nenema o.
I don’t have to pretend I’m okay here.	Mehiã be mawɔ abe ɖe mele nyuie le afisia ene o.
Something he had never seen before.	Nane si mekpɔ kpɔ o.
I know nothing about guns	Nyemenya naneke tso tu ŋu o
I think summer is really coming	Mesusu be dzomeŋɔli gbɔna ŋutɔŋutɔ
Now, of course.	Fifia ya.
As you wish.	Abe alesi nèdi ene.
However, this will only happen under certain circumstances.	Ke hã, nɔnɔme aɖewo me koe esia adzɔ.
I don’t know what to make of that.	Nyemenya nusi woawɔ tso ema ŋu o.
I could have handled the truth	Anye ne mate ŋu akpɔ nyateƒea gbɔ hafi
I would like to know the truth	Madi be manya nyateƒea
More and more people are talking.	Ame geɖe wu le nu ƒom.
But there is a problem.	Gake kuxi aɖe li.
I saw the excitement on his face	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ si nɔ eƒe mo
There is always another problem.	Kuxi bubu aɖe nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi.
I'm always amazed at that.	Mewɔa nuku nam ɣesiaɣi le nya ma ŋu.
I can’t take my eyes off her	Nyemate ŋu aɖe nye ŋku ɖa le eŋu o
I know what it’s like.	Menya alesi wòle.
I think everyone is just tired	Mesusu be ɖeɖi te amesiame ŋu ko
I put my head down.	Metsɔ nye ta ɖo anyi.
I am so close to them now	Mete ɖe wo ŋu ale gbegbe fifia
All these guys work hard and everything.	Ŋutsu siawo katã wɔa dɔ sesĩe kple nusianu.
And of course, some people are going to buy into it.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, ame aɖewo le nu ƒle ge ɖe eme.
And there was someone else in the background.	Eye ame bubu aɖe hã nɔ megbe.
Everyone will have a great night	Amesiame aɖu zã gã aɖe
Try it, at least.	Te kpɔ, ya teti.
But that may just be me.	Gake ate ŋu anye be nye ɖeka koe nye ema.
I think we can eat quickly	Mesusu be míate ŋu aɖu nu kaba
It’s just the idea.	Susu la koe wònye.
Something else that is far more important now.	Nu bubu aɖe si le vevie wu fifia kura.
He couldn’t understand it.	Mete ŋu se egɔme o.
I don’t always work alone.	Menye nye ɖeka koe wɔa dɔ ɣesiaɣi o.
Honestly, I was depressed about everything in it	Le nyateƒe me la, nusianu si le eme la te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
We don’t know who these people are.	Míenya ame siwo ame siawo nye o.
I am in a new place because of this book.	Mele teƒe yeye aɖe le agbalẽ sia ta.
None of them wanted to be there.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke medi be yeanɔ afima o.
I do my job well, though.	Mewɔa nye dɔa nyuie, gake.
I was finally getting excited about this kid	Meva nɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm ɖe ɖevi sia ŋu mlɔeba
I didn’t have a word.	Nya aɖeke menɔ asinye o.
I can live with that too.	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe kple ema hã.
This surprised us.	Esia wɔ nuku na mí.
Maybe you can figure things out.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu akpɔ nuwo gbɔ.
I was waiting for him to get close enough	Menɔ lalam be wòate ɖe eŋu alesi dze
Two men stood on one side.	Ŋutsu eve aɖewo tsi tre ɖe akpa ɖeka.
It's not like that.	Menye aleke o.
I needed a place to stay	Mehiã teƒe aɖe si manɔ
In fact, there is one for each of them.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele ɖeka na wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
Check them out!.	Kpɔ wo ɖa!.
I like how everything is together now	Alesi nusianu le ɖekae fifia la dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
I know what made you	Menya nusi wɔ wò
This is much more like this.	Esia sɔ kple esia wu kura.
I am a little nervous now.	Metsi dzodzodzoe vie fifia.
In fact, the opposite is true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae.
I am doing a lot of things.	Mele nu geɖe wɔm.
I don’t know about that	Nyemenya nu tso nya ma ŋu o
I don’t think this is a good idea	Nyemesusu be esia nye susu nyui aɖeke o
I'm in it.	Mele eme.
Quite the opposite.	Nusi to vovo kura na ema.
That’s part of it.	Ema nye eƒe akpa aɖe.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I know where he is.	Menya afisi wòle.
I wonder what is going on.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae le edzi yim hã.
I know this won’t be easy	Menya be esia manɔ bɔbɔe o
He fell to the ground.	Edze anyi ɖe anyi.
I think that’s as good a point as any	Mesusu be nya nyui aɖee nye ema abe nya ɖesiaɖe ene
I think that definitely points to someone who works there	Mesusu be ema fia asi ame aɖe si wɔa dɔ le afima godoo
I was waiting for someone	Menɔ ame aɖe lalam
Also, it can’t be good.	Azɔ hã, mate ŋu anyo o.
I asked who was home	Mebia be amekae le aƒeme hã
I had to do things differently.	Ele be mawɔ nuwo le mɔ bubu nu.
For many years now.	Ƒe geɖe enye sia.
I was looking forward to meeting you	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm vevie be mado go wò

That’s the first one.	Ema nye gbãtɔ.

I was very skeptical about it.	Meke ɖi le eŋu ŋutɔ.
I don’t know if any of it is true	Nyemenya ne wo dometɔ aɖe nye nyateƒe o
Thanks to everyone who contributed.	Akpe na amesiame si kpe asi ɖe eŋu.
Hit them very hard.	Ƒo wo sesĩe ŋutɔ.
It’s just not surprising.	Ðeko mewɔ nuku o.

I think that’s the whole part of it.	Mesusu be emae nye eƒe akpa bliboa.

But it is no longer the case.	Gake megale nenema o.
I could be totally wrong	Mate ŋu anye vodada kura
The police have come here.	Kpovitɔwo va afisia.
I trusted him and he came out.	Meka ɖe edzi eye eya hã do go.
I can handle this	Mate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ
Actual police work was very much like this.	Kpovitɔwo ƒe dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ nɔ alea ŋutɔ.
This is so good in many ways.	Esia nyo ale gbegbe le go geɖe me.
Be the place it is for you.	Nye teƒe si wòle na wò.
That wouldn’t surprise him.	Ema mawɔ nuku nɛ o.
His heart stopped.	Eƒe dzi tɔ te.

I had to call twice.	Ele be maƒo ka zi eve.

No one can do it.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋui o.

I wasn’t trying to impress him in any way	Menye ɖe menɔ agbagba dzem be mawɔ dɔ ɖe edzi le mɔ aɖeke nu o
He had a big hard head.	Ta sesẽ gã aɖe nɔ esi.

I had to make a new plan.	Ele be mawɔ ɖoɖo yeye aɖe.
I couldn’t see his face.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ eƒe mo o.
I can cope better there	Mate ŋu anɔ te ɖe enu nyuie wu le afima
I know you can hear.	Menya be àte ŋu ase nu.
Two piece in the back.	Eve ƒe akpa aɖe le megbe.
That explains a lot.	Ema ɖe nu geɖe me.
I would like to see some more books about his past.	Madi be makpɔ agbalẽ bubu aɖewo siwo ku ɖe eƒe agbe si wònɔ va yi ŋu.
We live in very strange times.	Míele ɣeyiɣi siwo mewɔ nuku kura o me.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe tae wòle alea ɖo.
I know where this is	Menya afisi esia le
And he couldn’t do anything.	Eye mete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
But they are coming this way.	Gake wole mɔ sia dzi gbɔna.
He will fight.	Awɔ avu.
Nice to meet you	Edzɔ dzi nam be medo go wò
I already know what happened	Menya nusi dzɔ xoxo
I think that’s amazing	Mesusu be esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
You might be surprised.	Ðewohĩ awɔ nuku na wò.
I can easily picture myself working here	Mete ŋu kpɔa ɖokuinye le susu me bɔbɔe be mele dɔ wɔm le afisia
It just might take some time.	Ðeko wòate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I think its something in my blood.	Mesusu be eƒe nane si le nye ʋu me.
Listen to my voice.	Se nye gbe.
I shouldn’t be ahead of them.	Mele be manɔ ŋgɔ na wo o.
I can’t take that away from you	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nya ma le asiwò o
I have seen them and already rejected them	Mekpɔ wo eye megbe wo xoxo
Not with you.	Menye kpli wò o.
I didn’t expect you so soon	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na wò kaba nenema o
He didn’t borrow any money.	Medo ga aɖeke o.
I have dealt with them before and had no problems	Mewɔ nu kpli wo do ŋgɔ eye kuxi aɖeke menɔ ŋunye o
And excellence is asking a lot of us.	Eye nusi nyo wu wɔwɔ le nu geɖe biam tso mía si.
Doing that, everything works fine.	Ema wɔwɔ la, nusianu wɔa dɔ nyuie.
And that’s what life is all about.	Eye emae nye agbe.
I often wonder which of us got the better deal	Zi geɖe la, mebiaa ɖokuinye be mía dometɔ kae xɔ asi si nyo wu hã
I will come and get them	Mava xɔ wo
I really enjoyed the whole season.	Ɣeyiɣi bliboa katã do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
It’s just to keep me busy.	Ðeko wònye be manɔ dɔ dzi nam.
But of course that wasn’t true before.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, ema menye nyateƒe tsã o.
I know this place better than any other	Menya teƒe sia nyuie wu teƒe bubu ɖesiaɖe
Do whatever you want.	Wɔ nu sia nu si nèdi.
We will be united.	Míawɔ ɖeka.
I just couldn’t find any	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeke ŋu o
I’ve done something wrong.	Mewɔ nu gbegblẽ.
It's very surreal.	Enye nusi me susu mele o ŋutɔ.
I found it, one way or another	Meke ɖe eŋu, le mɔ aɖe nu alo bubu nu
I quickly reached inside	Metsɔ kaba do asi ɖe eme
He is here now.	Ele afisia fifia.
I have a lot of people.	Ame geɖe le asinye.
I quickly prayed for them	Medo gbe ɖa kaba na wo
He had just been through a lot himself.	Ðeko eya ŋutɔ to nu geɖe me koe nye ema.
It doesn’t matter to me anymore.	Megale vevie nam o.
For the first time in his life, he needed a job.	Zi gbãtɔ le eƒe agbe me la, ehiã dɔ.
I was ready to go.	Menɔ klalo be mayi.
It’s not because of the people who made it.	Menye ame siwo wɔe la tae wòle nenema ɖo o.
There is nothing wrong with it.	Vodada aɖeke mele eŋu o.
Trust me now.	Ka ɖe dzinye fifia.
But he was the only one.	Gake eya ɖeka koe nye ema.
He could have gotten you from day one	Ate ŋu axɔ wò tso ŋkeke gbãtɔ dzi hafi
And that was a big thing for me.	Eye ema nye nu gã aɖe nam.
Waiting on it.	Le lalam le edzi.
I really wanted to	Medi vevie ŋutɔ
I can’t tell him the truth	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nyateƒea nɛ o
Everything is as it was.	Nusianu le abe alesi wònɔ ene.
Our people.	Míaƒe amewo.
I want to graduate here	Medi be manɔ afisia awu suku nu
Thankfully, he doesn’t ask what.	Akpe be mebiaa nukae o.
Definitely one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka godoo.
Something is better than nothing.	Nane nyo wu naneke o.
I told him how it was.	Megblɔ alesi wòle nɛ.
I don’t know what it’s like	Nyemenya alesi wòle o
I was here.	Menɔ afisia.
It doesn’t matter at all	Mehiã kura o
Where that’s going to be, we never know.	Afisi ema ava nɔ la, míenya gbeɖe o.
It didn’t bother him.	Meɖe fu nɛ o.
Who knows, at this point.	Amekae nya, le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
His back.	Eƒe megbe.
I was working on this all day.	Menɔ dɔ wɔm tso esia ŋu ŋkeke bliboa.
I know everything you’re going to say	Menya nya sia nya si nàgblɔ
There was another year.	Ƒe bubu hã nɔ anyi.
This comes as no surprise to anyone.	Esia mewɔa nuku na ame aɖeke o.
It has to work.	Ele be wòawɔ dɔ.
Maybe, he’s not smart either.	Ðewohĩ, eya hã medze aɖaŋu o.
I plan to wear them a lot	Meɖoe be mado wo geɖe
There was no one before him	Ame aɖeke menɔ anyi do ŋgɔ nɛ o
You don’t have to say any of this	Mehiã be nàgblɔ nya siawo dometɔ aɖeke o
Now or never.	Fifia alo gbeɖe o.
He didn’t care about me at all.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam kura o.
One word over another.	Nya ɖeka ɖe ame bubu dzi.
It’s a life and death situation for you.	Enye agbe kple ku ƒe nɔnɔme na wò.
I hope you enjoy it too	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wò hã adzɔ dzi na wò
He still didn’t answer.	Meɖo eŋu kokoko o.
Here, in the room.	Le afisia, le xɔa me.
I can’t let them go though	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le wo ŋu ya o
They had a hard, rotten life.	Agbe sesẽ, gbegblẽ nɔ wo dome.
You will have them all.	Wo katã anɔ asiwò.
You don’t know how it got there.	Mènya alesi wòwɔ va ɖo afima o.
A man is as good as his word	Ŋutsu aɖe nyo abe eƒe nya ene
I can help him with that	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu le ema me
I’m sure you know what it’s like.	Meka ɖe edzi be ènya alesi wòle.
I wouldn’t mind talking to someone	Maɖe fu nam be maƒo nu kple ame aɖe o
I was really worried about that	Metsi dzi ɖe nya ma ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
There’s a lot of good stuff out there	Nu nyui geɖe le afima
It was just the way it is.	Ðeko wònɔ abe alesi wòle ene.
It was another day like this.	Enye ŋkeke bubu si le abe esia ene.
I saw them there.	Mekpɔ wo le afima.
I think this is clear.	Mesusu be esia me kɔ.
Believe me, it seems normal.	Xɔ dzinye se, edze abe nusi sɔ ene.
Your car stops.	Wò ʋua tɔ.
I never wanted to be like him.	Nyemedi gbeɖe be manɔ abe eya ene o.
I know you all.	Menya mi katã.
It's just that simple.	Ðeko wòle bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe.
Last year was last year.	Ƒe si va yi nye ƒe si va yi.
We have the opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ le mía si.
This year, nothing.	Le ƒe sia me la, naneke meli o.
I made myself breakfast	Mewɔ ŋdi nuɖuɖu na ɖokuinye
But everything changed.	Gake nusianu trɔ.
Nothing I haven’t seen many times before.	Naneke meli si nyemekpɔ zi geɖe kpɔ o.
I couldn’t let them escape	Nyemete ŋu ɖe mɔ wo si le eme o
I guess he was busy.	Mesusu be vovo menɔ eŋu o.
I always make matching outfits for them	Mewɔa awu siwo sɔ kple wo nɔewo na wo ɣesiaɣi
I sincerely hope and pray that he will	Mele mɔ kpɔm tso dzi me eye mele gbe dom ɖa be awɔe hã
I didn’t have time.	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye o.
I just don’t see what I’m doing wrong here.	Nye ya nyemekpɔ nu gbegblẽ si wɔm mele le afisia o.
A nice guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖe.
Something he didn’t quite understand.	Nane si gɔme mese tututu o.
Or who knows what went through his head.	Alo amekae nya nusi to eƒe ta me.
I want to know if that is true	Medi be manya nenye be nya ma nye nyateƒe
He doesn’t care about money.	Metsɔ ɖeke le ga me o.
It’s very charming.	Eƒe nu lé dzi na ame ŋutɔ.
And there’s a good reason for that.	Eye susu nyui aɖe li si tae.
But this is something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖee nye esia.
I'm worried about you, that's all	Metsi dzi ɖe ŋuwò, ema koe nye ema
I never have time to do anything	Ɣeyiɣi mele asinye mawɔ naneke gbeɖe o
For whatever that’s worth.	Le nusianu si ema xɔ asi ta.
I would like to do the same here.	Madi be mawɔ nenema ke le afisia hã.
I believe in something	Mexɔ nane dzi se
One obvious reason is simple.	Susu ɖeka si dze ƒã la le bɔbɔe.
Something this guy knows something about.	Nane si ŋu ŋutsu sia nya nane le.
He just isn’t the only one.	Ðeko eya koe mele nenema o.
I wondered where it could have gone	Mebia ɖokuinye be afikae wòate ŋu ayi hafi hã
I definitely have to have one.	Ele be ɖeka nanɔ asinye godoo.
He didn’t have air.	Ya menɔ esi o.
Time stood still.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe tsi tre ɖe teƒe ɖeka.
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe li siwo tae.
The wind changed for me here.	Ya la trɔ nam le afisia.
It’s not me.	Menye nyee o.
I got home in an hour	Meɖo aƒeme le gaƒoƒo ɖeka me
I do this to get out and be with people	Mewɔa esia be mado go anɔ amewo gbɔ
That would be something, anyway.	Ema anye nane, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
And yet, there’s really only one.	Eye ke hã, ɖeka koe li ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I liked this	Esia dze ŋunye
I’m positive you can too.	Me le susu nyui me be wò hã àte ŋui.
I wanted to see what was so interesting	Medi be makpɔ nusi doa dzidzɔ nam alea gbegbe
And he didn’t do that.	Eye mewɔe nenema o.
I would love to share my work with you	Adzɔ dzi nam be magblɔ nye dɔa na mi
I was very pleased with it	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ
They are working on it.	Wole dɔ wɔm tso eŋu.
Now, that’s an honor in itself.	Fifia, ema nye bubu le eɖokui me.
Something different than he had.	Nane si to vovo na esi nɔ esi.
This one he's really enjoying.	Esia ɖeka si wòle dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔ.
I can’t answer him.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo eŋu nɛ o.
No one belongs to them.	Ame aɖeke menye wo tɔ o.
Really good stuff.	Nu nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But, it can only be one.	Gake, ɖeka koe ate ŋu anye.
There, he's actually asking for help.	Le afima, le nyateƒe me la, ele kpekpeɖeŋu biam.
What they had.	Nusi nɔ wo si.
You know he couldn’t have done this.	Ènya be mate ŋu awɔ esia hafi o.
Just what he had to do.	Nusi ko wòle be wòawɔ.
Over long periods of time.	Le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖewo me.
And that’s what surprised us.	Eye emae nye nusi wɔ nuku na mí ŋutɔ.
In fact, it could be the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, ate ŋu anye nusi to vovo na ema.
I knew there was more to me than that	Menya be nu geɖe li nam wu ema
The most appropriate dress	Awu si sɔ wu wu
Nice to meet you.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be medo go wò.
He did what he had to do.	Ewɔ nu si wòle be wòawɔ.
I was happy, but in a different way.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ, gake le mɔ bubu nu.
Really, really hard.	Nyateƒe, sesẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
This is very exciting.	Esia doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
I want you to do the same	Medi be wò hã nàwɔ nenema ke
I said as little as I could	Megblɔ nya sue aɖe alesi mate ŋui
I can’t just sit back and watch her die	Nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi akpɔ eƒe ku ko o
We know you have it.	Míenya be ele asiwò.
That’s the simple life.	Emae nye agbe bɔbɔe la.
I can get help now	Mate ŋu axɔ kpekpeɖeŋu fifia
It hasn’t come yet.	Meva haɖe o.
There is no room for error.	Vodada ƒe mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke meli o.
I can’t remember doing that	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi be mewɔ nu ma o
I knew there was a way	Menya be mɔ aɖe li
You too .	Wò hã .
He could have done without it.	Ate ŋu awɔe esia manɔmee hafi.
I hope you enjoy it too	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wò hã adzɔ dzi na wò
I only have to do it for a week.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka koe wòle be mawɔe.
I grew a foot almost overnight	Metsi afɔ ɖeka le zã ɖeka kloe me
I can’t get my head around any of them	Nyemate ŋu aƒo ta ɖe wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o
None of it mattered when he was here.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ vevie esime wònɔ afisia o.
It is what it is.	Enye nusi wònye.
I lost my job a long time ago	Dɔ ge le asinye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia
Today is no exception.	Egbea hã mele eme o.
He never did anything to them.	Mewɔ naneke ɖe wo ŋu kpɔ o.
I can’t get enough air all at once	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ya si sɔ gbɔ zi ɖeka o
But I have some issues.	Gake nya aɖewo le fu ɖem nam.
I couldn’t control my anger.	Nyemete ŋu ɖu nye dziku dzi o.
That was a year ago.	Ema nye ƒe ɖeka enye sia.
I hoped that would never end	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be ema nu mayi gbeɖe o
And tonight is .	Eye zã sia nye .
I want to do the same	Nye hã medi be mawɔ nenema ke
Which is the big deal.	Nukae nye nu gã la.
Perhaps, for now.	Ðewohĩ, fifia ya.
You know he would want to go.	Ènya be adi be yeayi.
That’s the whole point of it.	Emae nye nya bliboa si le eme.
I didn’t see anything at all that was out of the ordinary	Nyemekpɔ naneke kura si to vovo kura o
He just couldn’t go home.	Ðeko mete ŋu yi aƒeme o.
Something was different, and it was me.	Nane to vovo, eye nyee.
You can search for a thousand years.	Àte ŋu adi ƒe akpe ɖeka.
I just had to do it.	Ðeko wòle be mawɔe.
I live just a few blocks from here	Xɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe mele tso afisia gbɔ
Now that would be something!.	Fifia ema anye nane!.
No one could have understood that better than he did.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu ase nya ma gɔme nyuie wu eya hafi o.
I let anger take over	Meɖe mɔ dziku xɔ aƒe ɖe eme
I treated him the same way he treated me	Mewɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu abe alesi wòwɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋunye ene
You know you want to.	Ènya be yedi.
I think that really applies	Mesusu be nya ma ku ɖe eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ
Maybe it would be useful for me to address them.	Ðewohĩ aɖe vi aɖewo nam be makpɔ wo gbɔ.
I had no idea what lay ahead	Nyemenya nusi nɔ ŋgɔ nam o
I threw myself at him	Metsɔ ɖokuinye ƒu gbe ɖe eŋu
I must have passed out or something	Anɔ eme be nye lãme ku alo nane
It was important for another reason.	Susu bubu aɖe tae wònɔ vevie ɖo.
I think it can tell you a lot	Mesusu be ate ŋu agblɔ nu geɖe na wò
I know this won’t be easy.	Menya be esia manɔ bɔbɔe o.
Or he used to be.	Alo wònɔ tsã.
Work on things.	Wɔ dɔ tso nuwo ŋu.
I need to try my own hand at it	Ele be mate nye ŋutɔ nye asi kpɔ le eŋu
I hope that made her wet herself	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ema na eya ŋutɔ hã ƒo tsi
The king moved on in the night	Fia la ʋu yi ŋgɔ le zã me
I bought everything with my own money	Metsɔ nye ŋutɔ nye ga ƒle nusianu
I hope to be among them	Mele mɔ kpɔm be manɔ wo dome
You can’t ‘know who he really is.	Màte ŋu ‘anya amesi tututu wònye o.
But he won’t let go.	Gake maɖe asi le eŋu o.
It’s never a bad thing.	Menye nu gbegblẽ gbeɖe o.
He couldn’t wait four days.	Mete ŋu nɔ lalam ŋkeke ene o.
I want the first year to be good, which is right	Medi be ƒe gbãtɔ nanɔ anyi nyuie, si sɔ
People don’t really know about it	Amewo menya nu tso eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ o
Everything was wrong with him.	Nusianu gblẽ le eŋu.
I can see everything now	Mete ŋu kpɔa nusianu fifia
There is one thing he cannot do.	Nu ɖeka aɖe li si mate ŋu awɔ o.
This has never really been the case.	Esia menɔ alea ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o.
I wonder if he is okay.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe wòle nyuie hã.
I'll see you right after work	Makpɔ wò le dɔ megbe teti
I’m not in that position	Nyemele nɔnɔme ma me o
I have very suitable hands to work with you	Asi siwo sɔ ŋutɔ le asinye siwo awɔ dɔ kpli wò
You have a way about you.	Mɔ aɖe le asiwò ku ɖe ŋuwò.
I don’t know where he is	Nyemenya afi si wòle o
His life had not been easy.	Eƒe agbe menɔ bɔbɔe tsã o.
He did them all.	Ewɔ wo katã.
Like a real person.	Abe ame ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
I had to step up though	Ele be maɖe afɔ gake
I can’t quite do it tomorrow	Nyemate ŋui tututu etsɔ o
He is not at home yet.	Megale aƒeme haɖe o.
I was in my room	Menɔ nye xɔ me
I had the same problem.	Kuxi ma ke nɔ ŋunye.
I can’t take your money	Nyemate ŋu axɔ wò ga o
I was on the right side	Menɔ akpa si sɔ la dzi
That could be the case.	Ema ate ŋu anye nenema.
I know everything, remember	Menya nusianu, ɖo ŋku edzi
I was the closest thing to them	Nyee nye nusi te ɖe wo ŋu wu
A few people were watching them	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ wo kpɔm
You have to plan for it.	Ele be nàwɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
I couldn’t do anything though	Nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke o gake
But it is absolutely true.	Gake enye nyateƒe kura.
I was so sick I couldn’t handle it	Medze dɔ ale gbegbe be nyemate ŋu akpɔ edzi o
He never knew anything else.	Menya nu bubu aɖeke kpɔ o.
I couldn’t stand still	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe teƒe ɖeka o
This happened hours later.	Esia dzɔ le gaƒoƒo geɖe megbe.
I can’t just give up	Nyemate ŋu ana ta ko o
Doing this is really important.	Esia wɔwɔ le vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Nothing is ever the same.	Naneke megale abe tsã ene gbeɖe o.
I told you he would.	Megblɔ na wò be awɔe nenema.
Now that seems to be true.	Fifia edze abe nya ma nye nyateƒe ene.
I am actually here	Mele afisia ŋutɔŋutɔ
Maybe I’m not ready	Ðewohĩ nyemele klalo o
I didn’t mean to beat you	Menye ɖe meɖoe be maƒo wò o
His own mindset changed.	Eya ŋutɔ ƒe susu hã trɔ.
This worried me	Esia tsi dzi nam
It didn’t really work that way.	Mewɔ dɔ nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
In your mind’s eye.	Le wò susu me.
I haven’t figured out what it is yet.	Nyemekpɔ nusi wònye haɖe o.
I set it right.	Meɖoe nyuie.
I hope this helps someone else.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia akpe ɖe ame bubu ŋu.
I might say too much	Ðewohĩ magblɔ nya geɖe akpa
It is no longer the case.	Megale nenema o.
A difficult issue.	Nya sesẽ aɖe.
I don’t want anything to do with them.	Nyemedi be naneke nanɔ asinye kple wo o.
I'll be with you soon	Mava kpli wò kpuie
I liked him, you know	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam, ènya
I don’t want a job.	Nyemedi dɔ o.
I really enjoyed every moment of it	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eƒe ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ
And there is much work to be done.	Eye dɔ geɖe li woawɔ.
There will be nothing in it.	Naneke manɔ eme o.
This is not realistic at all.	Esia menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ kura o.
I am not at home right now	Nyemele aƒeme fifia o
But please go home today.	Gake taflatse yi aƒeme egbea.
All of these things happened.	Nu siawo katã dzɔ.
Come to think of it, after all, it’s still summer.	Va bu eŋu kpɔ, le nyateƒe me la, dzomeŋɔli gakpɔtɔ nye ema.
Consider what he did there.	Bu nu si wòwɔ le afima ŋu kpɔ.
No one could tell me that either.	Ame aɖeke hã mete ŋu gblɔ nya ma nam o.
You can call him.	Àte ŋu aƒo ka nɛ.
No help came.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke meva o.
I couldn’t be happier	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ wu ema o
I think that’s a good rule	Mesusu be ema nye se nyui aɖe
I just needed a day alone	Ðeko mehiã ŋkeke ɖeka be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi
Something clicked in his mind.	Nane ƒo ɖe eƒe susu me.
This is not pleasant at all.	Esia medze ame ŋu kura o.
They’re in this together.	Wole esia me ɖekae.
And that’s a good thing.	Eye esia nye nu nyui aɖe.
I do that pretty well too	Mewɔa ema nyuie ŋutɔ hã
I will tell you something else.	Magblɔ nya bubu aɖe na wò.
Watch everything, listen to everything.	Kpɔ nusianu ɖa, ɖo to nusianu.
We can’t do something for everyone.	Míate ŋu awɔ nane na amesiame o.
It certainly could be.	Ate ŋu anɔ nenema godoo.
See! 	Kpɔ!
Great, while it lasted.	Gã, esime wònɔ anyi didi.
I decided to do something a little different	Meɖoe be mawɔ nusi to vovo vie
Can someone please help me.	Taflatse ɖe ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
I miss everything about you	Nusianu si ku ɖe ŋuwò la le susu me nam
I know where his heart is.	Menya afi si eƒe dzi le.
I definitely do this.	Mewɔa esia godoo.
I am not the right person.	Menye nyee nye ame si sɔ o.
I tried to figure out why they were here	Medze agbagba be makpɔ nusita wole afisia
I always wondered what that would be like	Mebiaa ɖokuinye ɣesiaɣi be aleke ema anɔ hã
We don’t have enough support.	Kpekpeɖeŋu si sɔ gbɔ mele mía si o.
I almost couldn’t control myself	Nyemete ŋu ɖu ɖokuinye dzi o kloe
I think he has been depressed for a long time	Mesusu be nu te ɖe edzi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia
No one can ever know.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu anya gbeɖe o.
Believe me it is.	Xɔ dzinye se be ele nenema.
This is just a house.	Aƒe aɖe koe nye esia.
He didn’t listen.	Meɖo to o.
This isn’t you.	Menye wòe nye esia o.
I probably would too.	Anɔ eme be nye hã mawɔe nenema.
I can get there in two hours	Mate ŋu aɖo afima le gaƒoƒo eve megbe
Years later, however, it caught fire.	Ke hã, le ƒe geɖe megbe la, dzo dze edzi.
There is time.	Ɣeyiɣi li.
I inherited that desire	Mexɔ didi ma ƒe dome
He had a pretty good idea of ​​what they wanted.	Nusi dim wole la ƒe susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ nɔ esi.
We will do everything together.	Míawɔ nusianu ɖekae.
I never knew anything like it.	Nyemenya naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
You know it’s actually quite simple.	Ènya be le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I don’t want to see them.	Nyemedi be makpɔ wo o.
I have reason to have one.	Susu le asinye be ɖeka nanɔ asinye.
But not here, not in this place.	Gake menye le afisia o, menye le teƒe sia o.
He would never do that.	Mawɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
But he didn’t meet her.	Gake medo go o.
I never heard anything	Nyemese naneke kpɔ o
You are as short as he is.	Èle kpuie abe eya ene.
I had to play that role	Ele be mawɔ akpa ma
An idea came to me	Susu aɖe va susu me nam
But he didn’t touch me.	Gake meka asi ŋunye o.
I remember him being so charming	Meɖo ŋku edzi be eƒe nu lé dzi na ame ale gbegbe
Where was he staying.	Afikae wònɔ.
I don’t need to know what it is	Mehiã be manya nusi wònye o
It’s not that simple.	Menye nu bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
I couldn’t go on with this	Nyemete ŋu yi esia dzi o
I really like the car	Ʋua dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
I am how to be real	Nyee nye alesi mawɔ anye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ
I think that part encouraged me	Mesusu be akpa ma de dzi ƒo nam
I don’t have it anymore.	Megale asinye o.
He cannot know what is real.	Mate ŋu anya nusi nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Please give us time on this.	Taflatse na ɣeyiɣi mí le esia ŋu.
I wasn’t trying to rush out of here	Menye ɖe menɔ agbagba dzem be mawɔ kaba ado go le afisia o
In fact, just like you.	Le nyateƒe me la, abe wò hã ene.
I am right there with you	Mele afima tututu kpli wò
I have to take care of you too	Ele be makpɔ wò hã dzi
I had to try	Ele be mate kpɔ
I thought that was beautiful.	Mesusu be ema nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
Not now, not here.	Menye fifia o, menye le afisia o.
I don’t know exactly what	Nyemenya nusi tututu o
I don’t see anything wrong with it	Nyemekpɔ naneke si gblẽ le eŋu o
I couldn’t get enough of it	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ eƒe nu sɔ gbɔ o
But none of them worked.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ dɔ o.
But no one can tell them what to do.	Gake ame aɖeke mate ŋu agblɔ nusi woawɔ na wo o.
I can’t get you out of my mind	Nyemate ŋu aɖe wò le nye susu me o
I had to leave the house altogether	Ele be mado le aƒea me kura
I give you everything you want in life	Metsɔ nusianu si nèdi le agbe me la na wò
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
Please stick to.	Taflatse lé ɖe...
I’m from home.	Me tso aƒeme.
You are playing the same role.	Akpa ma ke wɔm nèle hã.
I just came to say hello	Ðeko meva be mado gbe na wò
I explained what had happened	Meɖe nu si dzɔ la me na wo
This is a very difficult issue.	Nya sia sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I am not sure how to do this.	Nyemeka ɖe alesi mawɔ esia dzi o.
I was looking for something	Menɔ nane dim
I want to go to them	Medi be mayi wo gbɔ
Another song, better than the last.	Ha bubu, si nyo wu mamlɛtɔ.
So do you, too.	Nenema ke wò hã.
Thanks again for this post.	Akpe ake ɖe nya sia ta.
It was just that way.	Ðeko wònɔ nenema.
I can’t prove it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo kpe edzi o.
His death came at this time	Eƒe ku va le ɣeyiɣi sia me
I thought he might not be there	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ mele afima o
This will work, but there is a downside.	Esia awɔ dɔ, gake nu gbegblẽ aɖe le eme.
I didn’t understand either.	Nye hã nyemese egɔme o.
It would be very nice.	Anyo ŋutɔ.
Focus on that.	Lé fɔ ɖe ema ŋu.
I really needed to do this	Ehiã be mawɔ esia nyateƒe
Run away and go.	Ƒu du yi.
I thought that was good enough	Mesusu be ema nyo ale gbegbe
I am interested in this project	Metsɔ ɖe le dɔ sia me
I was so happy to discover that he, too, touched it	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be meke ɖe eŋu be eya hã, ka asi eŋu
I can actually make it work	Mate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ
He was very interested in it.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme vevie.
This is a very good rule.	Esia nye se nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
It’s all in my head	Wo katã le nye ta me
A new opportunity presented itself.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ yeye aɖe va do mo ɖa.
If he doesn't, he won't.	Ne mewɔe o la, ke mawɔe nenema o.
I could never do that to you	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma ɖe ŋuwò gbeɖe o
Many things are important to me	Nu geɖe le vevie nam
I have my own house and car	Nye ŋutɔ nye aƒe kple ʋu le asinye
I started to look forward to my time with them	Meva nɔ mɔ kpɔm na ɣeyiɣi si manɔ wo gbɔ
I heard this too, with my own ears	Mese nya sia hã, kple nye ŋutɔ nye to
Believe in them.	Xɔ wo dzi se.
I want air in my face	Medi be ya nanɔ nye mo
That’s what happened.	Emae nye nusi dzɔ.
I think, to do that	Mesusu be, be woawɔ ema
I had to get them out of it	Ele nam be maɖe wo le eme
More of them fell.	Wo dometɔ geɖe wu dze anyi.
I can’t imagine my life without him	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nye agbe le susu me eya manɔmee o
I think he did some really good things	Mesusu be ewɔ nu nyui aɖewo ŋutɔŋutɔ
I hope you enjoyed it	Mele mɔ kpɔm be edzɔ dzi na wò
It wasn’t easy for him.	Menɔ bɔbɔe nɛ o.
I didn’t get it right	Nyemese egɔme nyuie o
That did come through.	Nya ma to eme nyateƒe.
Smoke and blood.	Dzudzɔ kple ʋu.
He was an angry man.	Enye ŋutsu si doa dziku.
He didn’t trust anyone.	Meka ɖe ame aɖeke dzi o.
He was just one man.	Ŋutsu ɖeka koe wònye.
I didn’t like the way it was	Ale si wònɔ alea la medze ŋunye o
A man needs his missing parts	Ŋutsu hiã eƒe akpa siwo bu la
I can’t stand another day here	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe ŋkeke bubu nu le afisia o
This is a good news.	Nya nyui aɖee nye esia.
I remember very well	Meɖo ŋku nu dzi nyuie ŋutɔ
Now you’re ready for the opposite side.	Fifia èle klalo na akpa si tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
I don’t want to see them all	Nyemedi be makpɔ wo katã o
We’re working on it.	Míele dɔ wɔm.
One more day.	Gbe ɖeka bubu.
And he was very pleased.	Eye edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
That’s always easy.	Ema nɔa bɔbɔe ɣesiaɣi.
It could be more than that.	Ate ŋu anye esi wu nenema.
I thought that was weird, she doesn’t have a dog	Mesusu be ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ, avu mele esi o
I hope this ends well	Mekpɔ mɔ be esia wu enu nyuie
I told him the truth last night	Megblɔ nyateƒea nɛ le zã si va yi me
I wanted them.	Medi wo.
They’re just like everyone else.	Wole abe ame bubu ɖesiaɖe ene.
He is someone far more important.	Enye ame aɖe si le vevie wu kura.
I stepped into a trap.	Meɖe afɔ ɖe mɔ̃ aɖe me.
He was focused on his food.	Eƒe susu nɔ eƒe nuɖuɖu ŋu.
It’s very old fashioned.	Enye xoxo ŋutɔ.
From here it’s easy.	Tso afisia la, ele bɔbɔe.
Everyone has to do their part.	Ele be amesiame nawɔ eƒe akpa dzi.
Not more than that.	Menye nusi wu ema o.
I reached this afternoon	Meɖo ŋdɔ sia gbɔ
But I needed to see you	Gake ehiã be makpɔ wò
I can’t deal with that right now	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ fifia o
He is clearly doing something wrong.	Edze ƒã be ele nu gbegblẽ wɔm.
That didn’t matter.	Ema menɔ vevie o.
You probably know these names.	Ðewohĩ ènya ŋkɔ siawo.
Please be one of them.	Taflatse nye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
Everyone lost their heads.	Amesiame bu eƒe ta.
A work in progress.	Dɔ aɖe si le edzi yim.

Matter.	Nu.
Just do it better.	Ðeko wɔe nyuie wu.
If only there was a better way	Ne ɖe mɔ si nyo wu la nanɔ anyi
I wasn’t close enough to do anything wrong	Nyemete ɖe ŋunye ale gbegbe be mate ŋu awɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖeke o
That bothered me a lot.	Ema ɖe fu nam ŋutɔ.
And he waited a very long time	Eye wònɔ lalam ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ
I know this will happen.	Menya be esia ava eme.
I was already quite busy today	Vovo menɔ ŋunye kura xoxo egbea
In his mind.	Le eƒe susu me.
And yet, he told me nothing.	Eye ke hã, megblɔ naneke nam o.
I decided to stay here	Meɖoe be manɔ afisia
Next month it will be someone else.	Ɣleti si gbɔna la, anye ame bubu aɖe.
I will keep fighting it, but you have to fight now.	Mayi edzi anɔ avu wɔm kplii, gake ele be wò hã nàwɔ avu fifia.
I started school late	Medze suku gɔme tsi megbe
I haven’t been able to find anyone yet	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ ame aɖeke haɖe o
It's not really bad	Menye nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ
I used to do it that way	Tsã la, mewɔa esia nenema
In fact, he can’t either.	Le nyateƒe me la, eya hã mate ŋui o.
However, we have some time now.	Ke hã, ɣeyiɣi aɖe le mía si fifia.
I knew that wouldn’t be easy	Menya be ema manɔ bɔbɔe o
Hold onto that anger.	Lé dziku ma me ɖe asi.
I want to find a way	Medi be madi mɔ aɖe
I think death would be the same	Mesusu be ku hã anɔ nenema
But he didn’t seem to mind.	Gake edze abe meɖe fu nɛ o ene.
This one doesn’t.	Esia mewɔe nenema o.
But everything is different now.	Gake nusianu to vovo fifia.
I wanted to go in the car, just by myself	Medi be mayi ʋua me, nye ɖeka koe
I didn’t expect this	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na esia o
I think everyone did that.	Mesusu be amesiame wɔe nenema.
I have nothing else to say	Naneke megale asinye magblɔ o
I remember them all now	Meɖo ŋku wo katã dzi fifia
His life didn’t allow for that.	Eƒe agbe meɖe mɔ ɖe ema ŋu o.
But now he had a job to do.	Gake fifia ya la, dɔ aɖe nɔ esi wòawɔ.
I could hear something behind us	Mete ŋu se nya aɖe le mía megbe
Or really care about it.	Alo tsɔ ɖe le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
In addition to one thing.	Tsɔ kpe ɖe nu ɖeka ŋu.
I’ve never seen anything like it	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o
He seems to have done the same.	Edze abe eya hã wɔe nenema ke ene.
I couldn’t quite work	Nyemete ŋu wɔa dɔ tututu o
That made no sense to him.	Susu aɖeke menɔ nya ma me nɛ o.
It can only come in its own time.	Ðeko wòate ŋu ava le eya ŋutɔ ƒe ɣeyiɣi me.
I'll be right over.	Mava wu enu tututu.
I don’t know that.	Nyemenya nya ma o.
I stand up for myself now	Metsi tre ɖe ɖokuinye ta fifia
I just needed some air	Ðeko mehiã ya vi aɖe
No one was sure what to make of it.	Ame aɖeke meka ɖe nusi wòawɔ tso eŋu dzi o.
It didn’t take long.	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
I have only myself.	Nye ŋutɔ ɖokuinye koe le asinye.
I wonder if this is death	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe esia nye ku hã
This was too important.	Esia nɔ vevie akpa.
In my nearby place.	Le nye teƒe si te ɖe ŋunye.
It won’t work here.	Mawɔ dɔ le afisia o.
I just felt like nothing was worth doing	Ðeko mese le ɖokuinye me be naneke medze be mawɔ o
I can only hope that for him there is nothing	Ðeko mate ŋu akpɔ mɔ be le eya ta la, naneke meli o
There was no one there.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
I knew he would	Menya be awɔe
I'll be there soon.	Mava nɔ anyi le afima kpuie.
But I can’t do it now	Gake nyemate ŋu awɔe fifia o
There was a better place.	Teƒe si nyo wu la nɔ anyi.
It also has its parts.	Eƒe akpa aɖewo hã le esi.
That seems worth it to me.	Ema dze nam be edze nam.
I was really worried.	Metsi dzi ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I just couldn’t understand what was going on.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu se nusi nɔ edzi yim gɔme o.

I knew what he wanted.	Menya nusi dim wònɔ.
I was obviously very impressed	Edze ƒã be mewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
I’ve done it before.	Mewɔe kpɔ do ŋgɔ.
It doesn’t matter what your life was like.	Aleke wò agbe nɔ tsã la mehiã o.
Treat others as you would like to be treated.	Wɔ nu ɖe ​​amewo ŋu alesi nèdi be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​ye ŋui.
It had already been a tough day.	Ŋkeke sesẽ aɖee wònye xoxo.
I didn’t see much after that	Nyemekpɔ nu geɖe le ema megbe o
I want this thing to have a name.	Medi be ŋkɔ nanɔ nu sia ŋu.
None of us will step up.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke mawɔ afɔ o.
I can’t accept this anyway	Nyemate ŋu axɔ esia le mɔ aɖeke nu o
I tried just about everything else.	Mete nu bubu ɖesiaɖe kloe kpɔ.
I think it’s you	Mesusu be wòe
I can’t do that for you	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma na wò o
See the accompanying notes.	Kpɔ nya siwo kpe ɖe eŋu la ɖa.
He was only one child.	Vi ɖeka koe wònye.
I am going to lose his mind	Mele eƒe susu yi ge
I know this is hard for you	Menya be nu sia sesẽ na wò
He fell hard and never let go.	Edze anyi sesĩe eye meɖe asi le eŋu gbeɖe o.
I personally struggle with this	Nye ŋutɔ mewɔa avu kple esia
You can talk to him yourself.	Wò ŋutɔ àte ŋu aƒo nu kplii.
No book is easy.	Agbalẽ aɖeke mele bɔbɔe o.
Maybe this is different for you.	Ðewohĩ esia to vovo na wò.
I think it’s because of his money	Mesusu be eƒe ga tae
That makes more sense.	Susu le nya ma me wu.
They are waiting for me.	Wole lalam nam.
But, it’s just one thing.	Gake, nu ɖeka koe wònye.
I can’t eat anymore.	Nyemate ŋu aɖu nu azɔ o.
But this is too much.	Gake esia sɔ gbɔ akpa.
I was sure something bad had happened.	Meka ɖe edzi be nu gbegblẽ aɖe dzɔ.
We can do this cheaply.	Míate ŋu awɔ esia le asi bɔbɔe me.
I will find a replacement	Makpɔ ame aɖe si axɔ ɖe eteƒe
Let them do whatever they want.	Na woawɔ nu sia nu si dze wo ŋu.
He wasn’t coming home.	Menɔ aƒeme gbɔna o.
Not surprising really.	Mewɔ nuku o ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He is running with them.	Ele du dzi kpli wo.
You may meet some people.	Àte ŋu ado go ame aɖewo.
But there was something he needed to do now.	Gake nane nɔ anyi si wòle be wòawɔ fifia.
It's too small for me now, really.	Ele sue akpa nam fifia, le nyateƒe me.
The money came in, the money went out, more money came in.	Ga la ge ɖe eme, ga la do, ga geɖe va ge ɖe eme.
He could have done that.	Anye ne ɖe wòate ŋu awɔe nenema hafi.
I knew he would do that	Menya be awɔe nenema
It will be very close to him.	Ate ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ.
The police were delighted.	Dzi dzɔ kpovitɔwo.
He had to try to get here.	Ele be wòate kpɔ hafi aɖo afisia.
However, things have changed.	Ke hã, nuwo trɔ.
And that there really are only so many of us, after all.	Eye be le nyateƒe me la, mía dometɔ geɖe koe li ŋutɔŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me.
The idea is long.	Susu la didi.
I am so in my head	Mele nye ta me ale gbegbe
We can go anywhere you want.	Míate ŋu ayi afi sia afi si nèdi.
You’re the man for the job.	Wòe nye ŋutsu si le dɔa ta.
That wasn’t easy either.	Ema hã menɔ bɔbɔe o.
A police car here and there	Kpovitɔwo ƒe ʋu aɖe le afisia kple afima
I'm that simple.	Me le bɔbɔe nenema.
A couple of points are in order.	Nya eve aɖewo le ɖoɖo nu.
I remembered this.	Meɖo ŋku esia dzi.
Actually, I thought I would tell him this	Le nyateƒe me la, mesusu be magblɔ nya sia nɛ
The thought in his head completed itself.	Susu si nɔ eƒe ta me la wu eɖokui nu.
That’s why we’re here.	Esia tae míele afisia ɖo.
We already know this.	Míenya esia xoxo.
I couldn’t stand it	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o
But he was very interested.	Gake etsɔ ɖe le eme vevie.
I can see the truth in all things	Mete ŋu kpɔa nyateƒea le nuwo katã me
I can’t tell you what he did to her	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi wòwɔ nɛ o
I have to tell you that	Ele nam be magblɔ nya ma na wò
I can’t say enough good things about them	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya nyui si sɔ tso wo ŋu o
This will take time.	Esia axɔ ɣeyiɣi.
A life that won’t let up	Agbe si maɖe asi le eŋu o
I connected with everything	Medo ka kple nusianu
I got sick really quickly.	Medze dɔ kaba ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It will be over soon.	Awu enu kaba.
This time everything went well.	Fifia ya nusianu yi edzi nyuie.
I probably could.	Anɔ eme be mate ŋui.
That place doesn’t exist.	Teƒe ma meli o.
I didn’t have any money	Ga aɖeke menɔ asinye o
Swim through both water and air.	Ƒu tsi to tsi kple ya me siaa.
I don’t see anything more we can do now	Nyemekpɔ naneke wu ema si míate ŋu awɔ fifia o
I’ve always been so happy.	Edzɔ dzi nam ale gbegbe ɣesiaɣi.
I have to go to work	Ele be mayi dɔme
That was very exciting for me.	Ema do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ.
This is no small matter at all.	Esia menye nya sue aɖeke kura o.
I only know as much as you do.	Nu geɖe koe menya abe wò ene.
I have to keep going.	Ele be mayi edzi.
A bit about it, right?.	Ku ɖe eŋu vie, alo?.
But we don’t know how to prove it.	Gake míenya alesi míawɔ aɖo kpe edzi o.
This will not always be the case.	Esia manɔ nenema ɣesiaɣi o.
They never had any food in the house.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke menɔ wo si le aƒea me kpɔ o.
It wasn’t that quick.	Menye ɖe wònye kaba nenema gbegbe o.
Nothing was his fault	Naneke menye eƒe vodada o
But he didn’t have it.	Gake menɔ eŋu o.
I could have handled that	Anye ne mate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ hafi
But one man withdrew from the group.	Gake ŋutsu ɖeka ɖe eɖokui ɖa tso ha la gbɔ.
But things went well.	Gake nuwo yi edzi nyuie.
There was a face in the night.	Mo nɔ zã la me.
I came to a strange place	Meva ɖo teƒe aɖe si mewɔ nuku o
Can anyone help me.	Ðe ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
That’s between them.	Ema le wo dome.
We will need to hurry.	Ahiã be míawɔ kaba.
I don’t know what it is.	Nyemenya nusi wònye o.
I wasn’t supposed to know this	Menye ɖe wòle be manya esia o
I was very worried about it	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu vevie
Or maybe it won’t.	Alo ɖewohĩ mawɔe nenema o.
I don’t know if that’s true or not	Nyemenya nenye be nya ma nye nyateƒe alo menye nyateƒe o
Tell them what you want.	Gblɔ nu si nèdi la na wo.
I can’t remember what my time was last time.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nusi nye ɣeyiɣi nye zi mamlɛtɔ dzi o.
You can tell me what happened your way.	Àte ŋu agblɔ nusi dzɔ le wò mɔ nu nam.
I think it will benefit them	Mesusu be aɖe vi na wo
I could end her life right here, right now	Mate ŋu awu eƒe agbe nu le afisia tututu, fifia tututu
This isn’t a bad thing.	Esia menye nu gbegblẽ o.
I knew that was going to happen	Menya be nu ma ava dzɔ
What was there that.	Nusi nɔ afima be.
I can’t do anything.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
No one is going to accept them.	Ame aɖeke mele wo dzi xɔ ge o.
That makes no sense to me.	Susu aɖeke mele nya ma me nam o.
I have tried a few things but nothing seems to work.	Mete nu ʋɛ aɖewo kpɔ gake edze abe naneke mewɔa dɔ o ene.
I’m the only one who does this.	Nye ɖeka koe wɔa esia.
He couldn’t help me.	Mete ŋu kpe ɖe ŋunye o.
It could have been so much more.	Ate ŋu anye nu geɖe wu hafi.

But they are clearly doing something.	Gake edze ƒã be wole nane wɔm.

I want our house with us	Medi be míaƒe aƒe nanɔ mía ŋu
It’s not possible.	Manya wɔ o.
Including my own.	Nye ŋutɔ tɔ hã le eme.

I didn’t hear anything	Nyemese nya aɖeke o
I am a real person.	Nyee nye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I just have some things on my mind	Ðeko nu aɖewo le susu me nam
In fact, we almost had two.	Le nyateƒe me la, eve kloe nɔ mía si.
I can say that now	Mate ŋu agblɔ nya ma fifia
I know what the outcome will be.	Menya nusi ado tso eme.
I can’t help in that regard	Nyemate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu le go ma me o
Maybe someone can explain something to me.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe ate ŋu aɖe nane me nam.
This made me nervous.	Esia na metsi dzodzodzoe.
Too much stuff or something.	Nuwo sɔ gbɔ akpa alo nane.
I didn’t know he had a dog	Nyemenya be avu le esi o
I was tired of what I knew	Nusi menya nyuie la te ɖeɖi ŋunye
I can’t be happy with anything else	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe nu bubu aɖeke ŋu o
I took that away from him	Meɖe ema le esi
He wasn’t here.	Menɔ afisia o.
He couldn’t help himself.	Mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe eɖokui nu o.
I have my life to live and so does he	Nye agbe le asinye be manɔ agbe eye eya hã le esi
I said the first thing that came to mind	Megblɔ nya gbãtɔ si va susu me nam
That would be a good thing.	Ema anye nya nyui aɖe.

Stay at home.	Nɔ aƒeme.
I had to tell him a lot	Ele nam be magblɔ nya geɖe nɛ

Maybe it will do some good.	Ðewohĩ awɔ nu nyui aɖewo.
This is obviously not going to work.	Edze ƒã be esia mawɔ dɔ o.

My first loss.	Nye nu gbãtɔ si bu.
Maybe that’s part of it.	Ðewohĩ ema nye eƒe akpa aɖe.
Everyone is seeing this.	Ame sia ame le esia kpɔm.
You can’t do anything more.	Màte ŋu awɔ naneke wu ema o.
I did my part too	Mewɔ nye akpa dzi hã
I couldn’t sit and wait	Nyemete ŋu nɔ anyi nɔ lalam o
This voice is important.	Gbe sia le vevie.
I fought, and I fought well	Mewɔ avu, eye mewɔ avu nyuie
There is someone inside, very close.	Ame aɖe le eme, si te ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ.
We can talk there.	Míate ŋu aɖo dze le afima.
They are not free.	Vovo mele wo ŋu o.
Who doesn’t do this.	Ame si mewɔa esia o.
I'm sure it's pretty easy though.	Meka ɖe edzi be ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ gake.
Still, he couldn’t let go.	Ke hã, mete ŋu ɖe asi le eŋu o.
This can happen very quickly.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ kaba ŋutɔ.
I wanted to try something different	Medi be mate nu bubu aɖe kpɔ
I can’t do this alone.	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔ esia o.
That’s who he is, what he’s done.	Emae nye amesi wònye, nusi wòwɔ.
I think he would like that	Mesusu be ema adzɔ dzi nɛ
I don’t really know what happened	Nyemenya nusi dzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o
Perhaps there is something else.	Ðewohĩ nu bubu aɖe hã li.
I don’t know and it doesn’t matter.	Nyemenya o eye mehiã o.
I couldn’t have done this without him	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia eya manɔmee o
But not in a bad way.	Gake menye le mɔ gbegblẽ nu o.
I have no problem with that.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ŋunye le ema ŋu o.
This will be the work of the present section.	Esia anye akpa si li fifia ƒe dɔ.
He lost blood.	Ʋu bu le eŋu.
He has the right car.	Ʋu si sɔ la le esi.
He didn’t say anything to her.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke nɛ o.
I think that’s why	Mesusu be esia tae
The summary is here.	Kpuie ko la le afisia.
There’s a little more to it than that.	Nu vi aɖe le eme wu ema.
You said it was a great job.	Ègblɔ be dɔ gã aɖee.
I have something to say	Nya aɖe le asinye magblɔ
I will fight you to the death for that	Mawɔ avu kpli wò vaseɖe ku me le ema ta
But it is possible.	Gake anya wɔ.
He wouldn’t talk to her.	Maƒo nu kplii o.
I grew everything.	Metsi nusianu.
I will talk about wanting a child	Maƒo nu tso vi didi ŋu
It’s actually quite simple.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
It's starting to.	Le egɔme dzem be.
Improve.	Yi ŋgɔ.
I can eat something too	Nye hã mate ŋu aɖu nane
It might be really bad.	Ðewohĩ anye nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Thank you very, very much.	Akpe na mi ŋutɔ, geɖe ŋutɔ.
I used to be you	Tsã la, menye wò tsã
For at least a year.	Ƒe ɖeka ya teti.
I didn’t know how to tell him what was wrong	Nyemenya alesi magblɔ nusi gblẽ la nɛ o
I didn’t know it was in it.	Nyemenya be ele eme o.
I think we can do it	Mesusu be míate ŋu awɔe
All at the same time, in my own life.	Wo katã le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me, le nye ŋutɔ nye agbe me.
I don’t know that much has changed, really.	Nyemenya be nu geɖe trɔ o, le nyateƒe me.
If he could be here with you, you know he would be.	Ne ate ŋu anɔ afisia kpli wò la, ke ènya be anɔ eme.
I know this is a bad time	Menya be ɣeyiɣi gbegblẽ aɖee nye esia
I can’t do that, you know.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema o, ènya.
Something threw up nearby once, twice.	Nane ƒu gbe ɖe teƒe si te ɖe afima ŋu zi ɖeka, zi eve.
Let me tell you something you may not know.	Na magblɔ nya aɖe si ɖewohĩ mènya o la na wò.
But we can do better.	Gake míate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu.
If you don’t really want to.	Ne mèdi ŋutɔŋutɔ o la.
More stuff like that.	Nu geɖe wu abe ema ene.
I know what I want	Menya nusi madi
The whole thing is about money.	Nu bliboa ku ɖe ga ŋu.
I was obviously very worried about them	Edze ƒã be metsi dzi ɖe wo ŋu ŋutɔ
Someone else has to do that.	Ele be ame bubu nawɔ ema.
I told him he didn’t need that.	Megblɔ nɛ be mehiã ema o.
You can take the steps you like.	Àte ŋu aɖe afɔ siwo dze ŋuwò.
I have to move on	Ele be mayi ŋgɔ
I never expected this	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na esia kpɔ o
Like, way too long.	Abe, mɔ didi akpa ene.
It's too abstract.	Enye nusi me susu mele o akpa.
I've been meaning to do it for some time now.	Meɖoe be mawɔe ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
That definitely means something.	Ema fia nane godoo.
I haven’t been able to open them yet.	Nyemete ŋu ʋu wo haɖe o.
I know what he seems to be talking about	Menya nusi dze abe ɖe wòle nu ƒom tso eŋu ene
Come along that way.	Va to mɔ ma dzi.
He couldn’t do anything.	Mete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
I wonder when was the last time anyone came here	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɣekaɣie ame aɖe va afisia zi mamlɛtɔ hã
I can’t handle that with you	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ kpli wò o
Everyone can see that	Amesiame ate ŋu akpɔ ema
I’m not talking here	Nyemele nu ƒom le afisia o
But we know it’s not true.	Gake míenya be menye nyateƒe o.
I really like these rules	Se siawo dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
I just wondered what you thought of it	Ðeko mebia be nukae nèsusu tso eŋu hã
This will be over.	Esia awu enu.
His face was relaxed.	Eƒe mo ɖe dzi ɖi.
I had things to do.	Nuwo nɔ asinye mawɔ.
It could have been anyone.	Ate ŋu anye amesiame hafi.
That would be something he might like.	Ema anye nusi ate ŋu adzɔ dzi nɛ.
I like everything about you	Nusianu si ku ɖe ŋuwò la dzɔa dzi nam
Anything is possible.	Nusianu ate ŋu adzɔ.
Still, it’s going well.	Ke hã, ele edzi yim nyuie.
He seemed nervous too.	Edze abe eya hã tsi dzodzodzoe ene.
My life came crashing down last year.	Nye agbe va dze anyi le ƒe si va yi me.
I was hoping you could help me with that	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye le ema me
I wonder what will happen to me	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae adzɔ ɖe dzinye hã
I know that is true.	Menya be nya ma nye nyateƒe.
I know that the.	Menya be le.
I got some road issues.	Mexɔ mɔ ƒe nya aɖewo.
I wonder what it’s like	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke wòle hã
It’s just the truth.	Nyateƒe koe wònye.
I think that’s kind of his thing.	Mesusu be esia ƒomevi nye eƒe nya.
This is a different problem.	Esia nye kuxi si to vovo.
But it is very small.	Gake ele sue ŋutɔ.
But that can’t be that easy.	Gake ema mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
Thank you for all my missing pieces	Akpe na mi ɖe nye akpa siwo katã bu la ta
I began to wonder where the money went	Meva nɔ ɖokuinye biam be afikae ga la yi hã
I need to find out more about it	Ele be mava nya nu geɖe tso eŋu
I know nothing more than you	Nyemenya naneke wu wò o
That’s none of my business.	Ema menye nye nya aɖeke o.
Open this one.	Ʋu esia.
I don’t want to let you go	Nyemedi be maɖe asi le ŋuwò o
I couldn’t get my car.	Nyemete ŋu xɔ nye ʋua o.
I guess what’s in it	Mesusu nusi le eme
I proved that to be true	Meɖo kpe edzi be nya ma nye nyateƒe
I have to marry this guy.	Ele nam be maɖe ŋutsu sia.
I knew almost nothing about it, really.	Nyemenya naneke kloe tso eŋu o, le nyateƒe me.
I can help with that.	Mate ŋu akpe asi ɖe eŋu le ema me.
Go ahead and do something for what you want!.	Yi ŋgɔ nàwɔ nane ɖe nusi nèdi ta!.
I never understood it	Nyemese egɔme kpɔ o
I think that’s a good idea.	Mesusu be susu nyui aɖee nye ema.
And only if no one else was there.	Eye ne ame bubu aɖeke menɔ afima o ko hafi.
A thousand, maybe a little more	Akpe ɖeka, ɖewohĩ esi wu nenema vie
I know you know something	Menya be ènya nane
That can’t go on.	Ema mate ŋu ayi edzi o.
That’s usually enough for me.	Zi geɖe la, ema sɔ gbɔ nam.
I was hoping he would pray.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be ado gbe ɖa.
Maybe I should explain this	Ðewohĩ ele be maɖe nya sia me
They are doing this.	Wole esia wɔm.
I was very skeptical.	Meke ɖi ŋutɔ.
Come as you are.	Va abe alesi nèle ene.
I am doing this for you	Mele esia wɔm na mi
It's just like me.	Ele abe nye ene ko.
A man had a large ear	Ŋutsu aɖe ƒe to gã aɖe ge ɖe eme
But it didn’t come cheap.	Gake meva le asi bɔbɔe me o.
It will help him.	Akpe ɖe eŋu.
I think it will stay here	Mesusu be anɔ afisia
I can definitely do that	Mate ŋu awɔ ema godoo
A simple system has few problems.	Kuxi ʋɛ aɖewo koe nɔa ɖoɖo bɔbɔe aɖe ŋu.
I just want to know why you did this	Ðeko medi be manya nusita nèwɔ esia ɖo
It will be like that.	Anɔ nenema.
A little something like that	Nu sue aɖe si le abe ema ene
I understand why he would do that to himself	Mese nusita wòawɔ nu ma ɖe eɖokui ŋu la gɔme
Some of them may not be widely known.	Ðewohĩ ame geɖe menya nu tso wo dometɔ aɖewo ŋu o.
So much for this.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ ɖe esia ta.
That is what the word means.	Emae nye nusi nya la fia.
But he couldn’t.	Gake mete ŋui o.
I got the news a week ago	Mexɔ nya la kwasiɖa ɖeka enye sia
He can come to my aid.	Ate ŋu ava kpe ɖe ŋunye.
I tried this, and it did nothing.	Mete esia kpɔ, eye mewɔ naneke o.
I can wear my hair up or down.	Mete ŋu doa nye ɖa ɖe dzi alo ɖe anyi.
I was moving on to something new	Menɔ ŋgɔ yim ɖe nu yeye aɖe ŋu
I remember the empty house	Meɖo ŋku aƒe si me ame aɖeke mele o la dzi
I had already quit my job	Meɖe asi le nye dɔ ŋu xoxo
I can’t be happy anywhere else	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ le teƒe bubu aɖeke o
Many people are not like him.	Ame geɖe mele abe eya ene o.
Look back there.	Kpɔ megbe le afima.
But very few actually do.	Gake ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔa esia ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I hope it didn't get wet	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mexɔ tsi o
I just want to know what happened	Ðeko medi be manya nusi dzɔ
I had no reason not to stay	Susu aɖeke menɔ asinye manɔ anyi o
So are you, probably.	Nenema ke wò hã nèle, ɖewohĩ.
He lived only a few hours.	Gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo koe wònɔ agbe.
A mistake is a mistake	Vodada nye vodada
I didn’t do this	Menye nyee wɔ esia o
We can’t do anything else.	Míate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
I can’t say the same thing	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma ke o
Live a good life.	Nɔ agbe nyui.
I look forward to seeing them.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be makpɔ wo.
Someone has to work on it.	Ele be ame aɖe nawɔ dɔ le eŋu.
Again, we’re not doing that.	Le afisia hã la, míele esia wɔm o.
In these circumstances.	Le nɔnɔme siawo me.
I can’t do it to them	Nyemate ŋu awɔe ɖe wo ŋu o
I really don’t think he would do that	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemesusu be awɔ nu ma o
I was as nervous as could be	Metsi dzodzodzoe alesi mate ŋui
It is inconsistent but somehow simple.	Mewɔ ɖeka o gake wòle bɔbɔe le mɔ aɖe nu.
The kind of person you want to be with.	Ame si ƒomevi nèdi be yeanɔ kplii.
The whole thing fell through.	Nu bliboa dze anyi to eme.
This would be better for him.	Esia anyo nɛ wu.
But you will need to hurry.	Gake ahiã be nàwɔ kaba.
We are glad we have it.	Edzɔ dzi na mí be ele mía si.
I am just one man.	Ŋutsu ɖeka koe menye.
He lost everything.	Nusianu bu nɛ.
It’s been a long time since I’ve heard from him	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia nyemese nya aɖeke tso eŋu o
That’s what I’m talking about.	Emae nye nye nya.
In about a day.	Le abe ŋkeke ɖeka ene me.
I am the great teacher	Nyee nye nufiala gã la
I can’t do everything.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nusianu o.
I just wanted to talk to you	Ðeko medi be maƒo nu kpli wò
I wondered why.	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukatae hã.
I can’t say who.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ be ame kae o.
If it is a book.	Ne agbalẽ aɖee.
But it will come tomorrow.	Gake etsɔ ava.
Maybe he will try this.	Ðewohĩ ate esia kpɔ.
I am not in this position today	Nyemele nɔnɔme sia me egbea o
I just really didn’t expect it to be you	Ðeko le nyateƒe me la, nyemekpɔ mɔ be wòe anye o
I had no one to help me	Ame aɖeke menɔ asinye si akpe ɖe ŋunye o
I don’t want to be anywhere else	Nyemedi be manɔ teƒe bubu aɖeke o
And that’s pretty good.	Eye esia nyo ŋutɔ.
I probably should have done it earlier, knowing who he was	Anɔ eme be ele be mawɔe do ŋgɔ na esia, esi menya amesi wònye ta
Many people agree with this position.	Ame geɖe da asi ɖe nɔnɔme sia dzi.
I never recognized you.	Nyemekpɔ wò dze sii kpɔ o.
He will take what is lost.	Axɔ nusi bu la.
I was the first to arrive	Nyee nye ame gbãtɔ si va ɖo
I don’t know that about you	Nyemenya nu ma tso ŋuwò o
But it was me.	Gake nyee.
I wanted to do something that mattered	Medi be mawɔ nane si le vevie
But this is different.	Gake esia to vovo.
I did it that way.	Mewɔe nenema.
We don’t know what we are.	Míenya nusi míenye o.
I have a very simple problem	Kuxi bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔ le ŋunye
He can trust you.	Ate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe ŋuwò.
I took two steps forward and looked back	Meɖe afɔ eve yi ŋgɔ eye mekpɔ megbe
I just do this.	Ðeko mewɔa esia.
I didn’t see anything	Nyemekpɔ naneke o
But it wasn’t me.	Gake menye nyee o.
Everyone who works there.	Ame sia ame si wɔa dɔ le afi ma.
And who helped me see life a little differently.	Eye amesi kpe ɖe ŋunye mekpɔ agbe le mɔ bubu nu vie.
But there is one thing.	Gake nu ɖeka aɖe li.
I can’t make it work	Nyemate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ o
I can’t handle that	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ o
Yours is interesting.	Wò tɔ doa dzidzɔ na ame.
I was too busy to fit in	Vovo menɔ ŋunye ale gbegbe be nyemete ŋu sɔ ɖe enu o
I just want to be with myself	Ðeko medi be manɔ ɖokuinye gbɔ
Everywhere there is something.	Afi sia afi la, nane li.
These words are too obvious.	Nya siawo dze ƒã akpa.
We focus on that.	Míaƒe susu nɔa ema ŋu.
I seem to be all up and down	Edze abe nye katã mele dzi yim kple anyi ene
It has never been like that.	Menɔ nenema kpɔ o.
Who do you think it is.	Amekae nèsusu be.
I was very impressed with him	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
I wanted them very badly.	Medi wo vevie ŋutɔ.
I was part of something after all	Menye nane ƒe akpa aɖe le nyateƒe me
I need to be able to do this	Ele be mate ŋu awɔ esia
For at least a week.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka ya teti.
I couldn’t hear them	Nyemete ŋu se wo o
I can do it tomorrow	Mate ŋu awɔe etsɔ
I decided to talk to you	Meɖoe be maƒo nu kpli mi
But this didn’t last more than a week.	Gake esia menɔ anyi wu kwasiɖa ɖeka o.
A matter of life and death	Agbe kple ku ƒe nya
I have been homeless, for a year	Aƒe mele asinye o, ƒe ɖekae nye esia
I felt comfortable there.	Meɖe dzi ɖi le afima.
I don’t really feel for any of them	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me ŋutɔŋutɔ ɖe wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o
I can’t quite explain it	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eme tututu o
I have to stay here	Ele be manɔ afisia
There’s not much to it, really.	Nu geɖe mele eme o, le nyateƒe me.
He couldn’t give them.	Mete ŋu na wo o.
This has changed to some extent.	Esia trɔ va ɖo afi aɖe.
That part of it was easy.	Eƒe akpa ma nɔ bɔbɔe.
I'm out, but just remember this.	Medo go, gake ɖo ŋku esia dzi ko.
I had to get out of there quickly	Ele be mado le afima kaba
Every part is important.	Akpa ɖesiaɖe le vevie.
I think it’s there now.	Mesusu be ele afima fifia.
I don’t want to do either	Nyemedi be mawɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o
There is only one chance.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖe koe li.
But, what was is still there.	Gake, nusi nɔ anyi la gakpɔtɔ li.
I tried to focus on my work	Medze agbagba be nye susu nanɔ nye dɔa ŋu
A name came to mind	Ŋkɔ aɖe va susu me nɛ
However, my heart is in my mouth.	Ke hã, nye dzi le nye nu me.
But someone else did.	Gake ame bubu hã wɔe nenema.
However, the following provisions apply.	Gake ɖoɖo siwo gbɔna la ku ɖe eŋu.
Maybe it’s because he’s never been happy.	Ðewohĩ esi mekpɔ dzidzɔ aɖeke kpɔ o tae.
I just work part time here	Ðeko mewɔa dɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe le afisia
Everyone is so much fun to work with	Amesiame doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ kplii
I was definitely nervous	Metsi dzodzodzoe godoo
Again, great job!.	Le afisia hã la, dɔ gã aɖe!.
Behind me though!.	Le nye megbe ya!.
I have eliminated them from my diet	Meɖe wo ɖa le nye nuɖuɖu me
I had too much stuff.	Nu geɖe nɔ asinye akpa.

He has plenty of time.	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe le esi.

I didn’t want to go with them	Nyemedi be mayi kpli wo o
He could have done it.	Ate ŋu awɔe hafi.
We already know everything.	Míenya nusianu xoxo.
It may be in it.	Ate ŋu anɔ eme.
He needed something else.	Ehiã nu bubu aɖe.
I just remembered something	Ðeko meɖo ŋku nane dzi
It would be very nice.	Anyo ŋutɔ.
He couldn't do it.	Mete ŋui o.
I now know what that means	Menya nusi ema fia azɔ
Everything is new here.	Nusianu nye nu yeye le afisia.
And maybe.	Eye ɖewohĩ.
I wonder why they are here	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae wole afisia hã
I tried, but I couldn’t	Medze agbagba, gake nyemete ŋui o
I can offer a great and independent price	Mate ŋu ana asi gã aɖe kple asi si le eɖokui si
He was a character.	Ame aɖee wònye.
I would like to see one	Madi be makpɔ ɖeka
After that, who knows.	Le ema megbe la, amekae nya.
I shouldn’t talk to him	Mele be maƒo nu kplii o
He couldn’t handle this now.	Mete ŋu kpɔ esia gbɔ fifia o.
He could not call at this hour.	Mete ŋu ƒo ka le gaƒoƒo sia me o.
I couldn’t stand me	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe dzinye o
I can’t really explain it	Nyemate ŋu aɖe eme ŋutɔŋutɔ o
Think of the men who did it.	Bu ŋutsu siwo wɔe la ŋu kpɔ.
You will have four parts.	Akpa ene anɔ asiwò.
I remember that summer.	Meɖo ŋku dzomeŋɔli ma dzi.
But he didn’t understand much.	Gake mese nu geɖe gɔme o.
I worked with him for months	Mewɔ dɔ kplii ɣleti geɖe
I probably should have been.	Anɔ eme be ɖe wòle be manɔ nenema hafi.
I would love to share that one.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be magblɔ ɖeka ma.
Things are good, thank you.	Nuwo nyo, akpe na wò.
After that, we know a lot.	Le ema megbe la, míenya nu geɖe.
I don’t have my own eyes and ears	Nye ŋutɔ nye ŋku kple to mele asinye o
I could barely get through one	Ƒã hafi mete ŋu to ɖeka me
He looked tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi te eŋu ene.
But that really played a minor role in his life.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nya ma wɔ akpa sue aɖe le eƒe agbe me.
That seems pretty expensive.	Edze abe ema xɔ asi ŋutɔ ene.
These two were amazing throughout the entire process.	Ame eve siawo wɔ nuku ŋutɔ le ɖoɖo bliboa katã me.
I stood in it in it	Metsi tre nɔ eme nɔ eme
I can't say if he has hair	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ ne ɖa le eŋu o
In fact, he has nothing.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke mele esi o.
Clearly, something is wrong.	Edze ƒã be nane gblẽ.
In fact, this whole thing is one big mistake.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu sia katã nye vodada gã ɖeka.
Not that I said anything about it	Menye ɖe megblɔ naneke le eŋu o
It was just very convenient.	Ðeko wònye nusi sɔ ŋutɔ.
I think it will stay this week.	Mesusu be anɔ anyi le kwasiɖa sia me.

I told you it didn’t work the first time	Megblɔ na mi be mewɔ dɔ zi gbãtɔ o
I can’t help my curiosity	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke le nye didi be manya nu ŋu o
I glanced in every direction	Meɖe ŋku ɖe akpa sia akpa
They had the person they had.	Ame si nɔ wo si la nɔ wo si.
I was very happy with it.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ɖe eŋu.
A man in a police uniform has just entered	Ðeko ŋutsu aɖe si do kpovitɔwo ƒe awu la ge ɖe eme teti koe nye ema
I just couldn’t stand it	Ðeko nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o
He seemed to like it too.	Edze abe edzɔ dzi nɛ hã ene.
I have a job for him tomorrow	Dɔ aɖe le asinye nɛ etsɔ
Time before time.	Ɣeyiɣi do ŋgɔ na ɣeyiɣi.
I wasn’t trying to keep up	Menye ɖe menɔ agbagba dzem be mawɔ ɖeka kplii o
That’s a big deal.	Nya gã aɖee nye ema.

Return in a few days.	Trɔ gbɔ le ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo megbe.
Two sides meet when they are on the same issue.	Akpa eve doa go ne wole nya ɖeka me.
Not with him, not with anyone.	Menye kplii o, menye kple ame aɖeke o.
I felt great about that	Mese le ɖokuinye me ŋutɔ le nya ma ta
I have to keep talking down myself	Ele be nye ŋutɔ mayi edzi anɔ nu ƒom ɖe anyi
I didn’t recognize any of them	Nyemekpɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke dze sii o
This is the end of the matter.	Nya sia wu enu.
Now he is one of them.	Fifia enye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
I personally struggle with this.	Nye ŋutɔ mewɔa avu kple esia.
I really hope he doesn’t	Mele mɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ be mawɔe nenema o
I can imagine you in that position	Mate ŋu akpɔ wò le susu me le nɔnɔme ma me
You will be surprised.	Awɔ nuku na wò ŋutɔ.

But he couldn’t see them.	Gake mete ŋu kpɔ wo o.
I am not a good person	Menye ame nyui aɖee menye o
I have to make another one	Ele be mawɔ ɖeka bubu
I hope he's not here alone	Mele mɔ kpɔm be menye eya ɖeka koe va afisia o
It obviously worked.	Edze ƒã be ewɔ dɔ.
Why not? 	Aleke wɔ?
In absolutely every way.	Le mɔ ɖesiaɖe nu kura.
I had no idea what he was going to do	Nyemenya nusi wòawɔ kura o
I stepped up.	Meɖe afɔ ɖe dzi.
You can see what you think.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nusi nèsusu.
I could feel it there	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me be ele afima
We are one car.	Ʋu ɖeka míenye.
I knew he would be here	Menya be anɔ afisia
I remember it well	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie
We can say something.	Míate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖe.
I can’t do this alone	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu awɔ esia o
I think it’s going to be great, great	Mesusu be anye nu gã aɖe, nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ
Further.	Kpe ɖe eŋu.
But a week has passed.	Gake kwasiɖa ɖeka va yi.
I asked that question.	Mebia nya ma.
Not now, not tomorrow.	Menye fifia o, menye etsɔ hã o.
It’s starting to happen.	Edze egɔme.
Trust this plan.	Ka ɖe ɖoɖo sia dzi.
I had to withdraw to protect them	Ele be maɖe ɖokuinye ɖa be makpɔ wo ta
I'm not going to write anything after this.	Nyemele naneke ŋlɔ ge le esia megbe o.
You have to be quick.	Ele be nàwɔ kaba.
Look where that went.	Kpɔ afisi ema yi ɖa.
I felt like I had fallen myself	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye ŋutɔ medze anyi
I already knew about this place	Menya nu tso teƒe sia ŋu xoxo
But I decided to keep my word	Gake meɖoe be mawɔ ɖe nye nya dzi
There is nothing better than this.	Naneke meli si nyo wu esia o.
A great man, a great man	Ame gã aɖe, ame gã aɖe
He doesn’t own a house.	Aƒe menye eya ŋutɔ tɔ o.
He would be so surprised.	Awɔ nuku nɛ ale gbegbe.
I don’t want to talk about them	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso wo ŋu o
It didn’t make sense to me either.	Susu menɔ eme nam hã o.
None can exceed two years.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ wu ƒe eve o.
Things got a little better.	Nuwo va nyo ɖe edzi vie.
I know what this means to you.	Menya nu si esia fia na mi.
But we know nothing about these roads.	Gake míenya naneke tso mɔ siawo ŋu o.
This city needs something like this.	Du sia hiã nane si le abe esia ene.
So he wasn’t helping me.	Eya ta menɔ kpekpeɖeŋu nam o.
He never did it.	Mewɔe kpɔ o.
Stone on stone.	Kpe ɖe kpe dzi.
I could have saved his life	Anye ne mate ŋu aɖe eƒe agbe hafi
I know this is different	Menya be esia to vovo
I will meet the right person.	Mado go ame si sɔ.
And now we have this thing coming.	Eye fifia nu sia le mía si gbɔna.
I think it’s going well	Mesusu be ele edzi yim nyuie
I just didn’t like him	Ðeko eƒe nu medze ŋunye o
Nothing has proved it.	Naneke meɖo kpe edzi o.
You never know what he might say.	Mènya nya si wòate ŋu agblɔ gbeɖe o.
And it very likely will.	Eye anɔ eme ŋutɔ be awɔe nenema.
I don’t know where he is	Nyemenya afi si wòle o
I can be there with them.	Mate ŋu anɔ afima kpli wo.
That way you can see what you have.	To mɔ sia dzi la, àte ŋu akpɔ nu si le asiwò.
Think about this so carefully.	Bu esia ŋu nyuie alea gbegbe.
That seemed to calm him down.	Edze abe nya ma na eƒe dzi dze eme ene.
A path is life itself	Mɔ aɖee nye agbe ŋutɔ
Maybe just one person.	Ðewohĩ ame ɖeka koe.
I felt like an equal for the first time	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ame si sɔ kplii ene zi gbãtɔ
He can’t go on.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi o.
I took my gun with me.	Metsɔ nye tu ɖe asi.
I finally found a place	Meva ke ɖe teƒe aɖe ŋu mlɔeba
I do everything wrong, everything	Mewɔa nusianu gbegblẽ, nusianu
He didn’t look at anyone.	Mekpɔ ŋku ɖe ame ŋu o.
I have more help	Kpekpeɖeŋu geɖe wu le asinye
He can’t bear it.	Mate ŋu ado dzi o.
I look like one too	Nye hã medze abe ɖeka ene
They have no children together	Vi aɖeke mele wo si ɖekae o
But he had made mistakes before.	Gake ewɔ vodada tsã.
It’s something in me.	Enye nane le menye.
Don’t expect it at all.	Kpɔ mɔ nɛ kura o.
But he didn’t care much.	Gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme boo o.
There is a snake there too.	Da le afima hã.
There is everything to do.	Nusianu si li be woawɔ la li.
Be a little more careful	Kpɔ nyuie vie wu
But this one took time.	Gake esia ya xɔ ɣeyiɣi.
Go where, but in the case.	Yi afi si, gake le nya la me.
I could see his face now	Mete ŋu kpɔ eƒe mo azɔ
Nothing is too small	Naneke mele sue akpa o
I think this is a little too complicated	Mesusu be esia nye nusi me kɔ vie akpa
It doesn’t work that way.	Mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
I will find out the truth myself	Nye ŋutɔ makpɔ nyateƒea
I’ve never felt that way before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o
You know what’s coming.	Ènya nusi gbɔna.
No one knows any better.	Ame aɖeke menya naneke wu ema o.
He had a nice new one.	Yeye nyui aɖe nɔ esi.
I don’t mean to offend you	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mado dziku na wò o
I am not in the market for a man	Menye ŋutsu tae mele asi me o
Now he was tired.	Fifia ɖeɖi te eŋu.
Create the life you want to live.	Wɔ agbe si nèdi be yeanɔ la.
Everything is ready.	Nusianu le klalo.
I know why he did that.	Menya nu si tae wòwɔ nu ma ɖo.
And in two rooms.	Eye le xɔ eve me.
No one else is me.	Ame bubu aɖeke menye nye o.
I know this is difficult.	Menya be esia sesẽ.
The morning obviously went well.	Edze ƒã be ŋdi la yi nyuie.
I just don’t know how to pray better	Ðeko nyemenya alesi mado gbe ɖa nyuie wu o
I’ve never seen that before.	Nyemekpɔ nu ma kpɔ o.
I tried to look away	Medze agbagba be maɖe ŋku ɖa
I panicked right after	Metsi dzodzodzoe le ema megbe teti
And one more thing.	Eye nu ɖeka bubu hã.
I decided to give this a try	Meɖoe be mate esia kpɔ
I’ve done that before	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ
I’m not sure what people were expecting.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi amewo nɔ mɔ kpɔm na dzi o.
I don’t know about it	Nyemenya nu tso eŋu o
I will test them for you	Mado wo kpɔ na wò
This doesn’t work.	Esia mewɔa dɔ o.

But.	Gake.
I hope you can do as well	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu awɔe abe alesi wòle ene
I have been here before.	Menɔ afisia do ŋgɔ.
I recognized it all from that fight	Mekpɔ wo katã dze sii tso avu ma me
Now that was the plan they had.	Fifia emae nye ɖoɖo si nɔ wo si la.
Have someone else.	Ame bubu aɖe nanɔ asiwò.
My name is not on anything.	Nye ŋkɔ mele naneke dzi o.
I don’t think it matters	Mesusu be mehiã o
I think maybe it’s weird	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ enye nusi mewɔ nuku o
To his surprise, he didn’t get any.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ be mexɔ ɖeke o.
I can’t deal with everything going on like I used to	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusianu si le edzi yim abe tsã ene gbɔ o
I looked forward to it	Mekpɔ mɔ nɛ vevie
I can’t bear to be without her	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi anɔ anyi eya manɔmee o
There is no issue.	Nya aɖeke meli o.
Share the ideas in this book.	Gblɔ susu siwo le agbalẽ sia me la na wo.
It has worked before.	Ewɔ dɔ kpɔ.
I can see very clearly.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nu nyuie ŋutɔ.
I was happy with myself.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu.
I know you’re there	Menya be èle afima
He leveled his gun at me.	Etsɔ eƒe tu la sɔ gbɔ ɖe ŋunye.
The bullet in his back was enough for him.	Tu si nɔ eƒe megbe la sɔ gbɔ nɛ.
I can do that, now too	Mate ŋu awɔ ema, fifia hã
I couldn’t see who attacked me	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ amesi dze dzinye o
This is true, of course.	Esia nye nyateƒe ya.
I think it might be useful for you too.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ aɖe vi na wò hã.
Looks like hair is ready to go.	Edze abe ɖa le klalo be yeayi ene.
I was able to get along with everyone	Mete ŋu nɔa anyi kple amesiame nyuie
I couldn’t stop thinking about them	Nyemete ŋu dzudzɔ wo ŋu bubu o
I only got his name this morning.	Eƒe ŋkɔ koe mexɔ ŋdi sia.
I can’t tell you anything else yet	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya bubu aɖeke na wò haɖe o
I rejected that idea	Megbe susu ma
I didn’t recognize them	Nyemekpɔ wo dze sii o
And every year, more and more people are doing just that.	Eye ƒe sia ƒe la, ame geɖe wu va le nu ma tututu wɔm.
I was just angrier	Ðeko medo dziku wu
I can't seem to find that anywhere	Edze abe nyemate ŋu akpɔ ema le afi aɖeke o ene
I want to stay in the house	Medi be manɔ aƒea me
He just has a mouth.	Ðeko nu le esi.
He had some ideas.	Susu aɖewo nɔ esi.
We just know.	Ðeko míenya.
I had to tell myself that it was	Ele be magblɔ na ɖokuinye be ele nenema
He didn’t do that either.	Mewɔe nenema hã o.
It was that quick.	Ewɔ kaba nenema gbegbe.
It will definitely be better now.	Anyo wu fifia godoo.
He didn’t know how long.	Menya alesi wòawɔ ɣeyiɣi didi o.
I want to work on my house	Medi be mawɔ dɔ tso nye aƒea ŋu
Maybe not quite really.	Ðewohĩ menye le nyateƒe me tututu o.

None of it will make sense to you.	Susu aɖeke manɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu na wò o.

It really has to work.	Ele be wòawɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.

There is no one there.	Ame aɖeke mele afima o.
I wasn’t in a rush for this	Menye ɖe menɔ du dzi ɖe esia ŋu o
None of us ever came.	Mía dometɔ aɖeke meva kpɔ o.
At the same time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me.
The first came last year.	Gbãtɔ va le ƒe si va yi me.
No one else would have told me that.	Anye ne ame bubu aɖeke magblɔ nya ma nam o.
I will probably do that	Anɔ eme be mawɔe nenema
For a very long time.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
I just can’t do that	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔ ema o
They have no place.	Teƒe aɖeke mele wo si o.
This is a very difficult situation.	Esia nye nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
Now you have me.	Fifia nyee le asiwò.
But it is personal.	Gake enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
But this is a necessity.	Gake esia nye nusi hiã.
I don’t think he heard anything	Mesusu be mese naneke o
I had no clothes at all	Awu aɖeke kura menɔ asinye o
There is plenty of grass here, and water.	Gbe sɔ gbɔ le afisia, kple tsi.
I don’t know exactly where it is	Nyemenya afi si tututu wòle o
Everything was smooth and easy.	Nusianu nɔ edzi yim nyuie eye wònɔ bɔbɔe.
This is very exciting.	Esia doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
He can know about you.	Ate ŋu anya nu tso ŋuwò.
I should be able to marry her	Ele be mate ŋu aɖee
I went days without food	Menɔ anyi ŋkeke geɖe nuɖuɖu manɔmee
But people did die.	Gake amewo ku nyateƒe.
I can walk from here	Mate ŋu azɔ tso afisia
He certainly wouldn’t.	Mawɔe nenema o godoo.
You are doing your job.	Èle wò dɔ wɔm.
I saw what he was doing.	Mekpɔ nu si wɔm wònɔ.
This may be true.	Esia ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
He couldn't have gotten out of here.	Mate ŋu ado go le afisia hafi o.
I needed to talk to him about them	Ehiã be maƒo nu tso wo ŋu nɛ
Maybe as soon as this morning.	Ðewohĩ le ŋdi sia me teti.
I work hard every day	Mewɔa dɔ sesĩe gbe sia gbe

I can’t go near it now	Nyemate ŋu ate ɖe eŋu fifia o

We’re not taking care of each other.	Míele mía nɔewo dzi kpɔm o.
There was never anything between us.	Naneke menɔ mía dome kpɔ o.

I just knew all the trouble he was going through	Ðeko menya kuxi siwo katã me tom wònɔ
Not now, not ever.	Menye fifia o, menye gbeɖe o.

A few cars also moved up	Ʋu ʋɛ aɖewo hã ʋu yi dzi
He didn’t see them.	Mekpɔ wo o.

He escaped from it, too.	Eya hã si le eme.
I did it for you, too	Mewɔe na wò hã
And good morning to you.	Eye ŋdi nyui na wò.
He was a different man.	Enye ŋutsu si to vovo na tsã.
He didn’t want to go up there.	Medi be yeayi dzi le afima o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
People who don’t do well don’t do well.	Ame siwo mewɔa dɔ nyuie o la mewɔa dɔ nyuie o.
I couldn’t keep my mind in one direction for long	Nyemete ŋu lé nye susu ɖe mɔ ɖeka dzi ɣeyiɣi didi o

I cannot stress how important that is	Nyemate ŋu ate gbe ɖe alesi gbegbe ema le vevie dzi o
No one treated me like a man.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋunye abe ŋutsu ene o.

A life that matches your life.	Agbe si sɔ kple wò agbe.
I just wish you could have known somehow	Ðeko medi be àte ŋu anya le mɔ aɖe nu hafi
I want everyone to be watching this.	Medi be amesiame nanɔ esia kpɔm.

I couldn’t handle that.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ ema gbɔ o.

Look at me, guys.	Kpɔm ɖa.
You can stay there for a few hours.	Àte ŋu anɔ afima gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo.
The only problem we had was bad food.	Kuxi si nɔ mía ŋu koe nye nuɖuɖu gbegblẽ.

I was worried about it	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu
I couldn’t be more impressed	Nyemate ŋu awɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye wu ema o

His car was too dominant.	Eƒe ʋua ɖu dzi akpa.

Nothing revealed itself.	Naneke meɖe eɖokui fia o.
I wasn’t supposed to be there, really	Menye ɖe wòle be manɔ afima o, le nyateƒe me

He seemed to have a lot.	Edze abe nu geɖe nɔ esi ene.

Stay at home.	Nɔ aƒeme.

You are on a quest.	Èle didi aɖe dzi.

That would help in all sorts of ways.	Ema akpe ɖe ame ŋu le mɔ ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe nu.

But only a little bit.	Gake vi aɖe koe.

And this happened with very little trouble.	Eye esia dzɔ kple kuxi sue aɖe ko.

However, there are some situations where things are easy.	Ke hã nɔnɔme aɖewo li siwo me nuwo le bɔbɔe le.
I can talk to him, but he can’t talk to her	Mate ŋu aƒo nu kplii, gake mate ŋu aƒo nu nɛ o
The meeting lasted several hours.	Kpekpea xɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe.
Just a good idea.	Susu nyui ko.
You are the last to fall.	Wòe nye ame mamlɛtɔ si dze anyi.
This same machine is alive and well today.	Mɔ̃ sia ke le agbe eye wòle nyuie egbea.
Work, task or occupation	Dɔ, dɔ alo dɔ si woawɔ
I, of course, told him about you	Nye, le nyateƒe me, megblɔ wò ŋu nya nɛ
They are alive.	Wole agbe.
This is a complete lie.	Esia nye alakpa kura.
I can’t remember ever feeling this way	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi be mese le ɖokuinye me alea kpɔ o
Everyone enjoys it very much.	Amesiame kpɔa dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ.
I know you all well	Menya mi katã nyuie
I really like that name	Ŋkɔ ma dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
I don’t know what to say	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ o
Just because he liked her.	Esi eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ta koe.
He might kill himself.	Ðewohĩ awu eɖokui.

His reason was simple.	Susu si tae wòwɔ nu ɖo la nɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I’m sorry, too.	Meɖe kuku, nye hã.
He wasn’t a good fit for her.	Menye amesi sɔ nyuie nɛ o.

I wanted to get out of it that way	Medi be mado le eme nenema

And everyone was happy.	Eye amesiame kpɔ dzidzɔ.

A cynic can see a downside in that.	Ame si ƒoa nu tsi tre ɖe nu ŋu ate ŋu akpɔ nu gbegblẽ aɖe le ema me.

I wonder if you have that	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe ema le asiwò hã
We know that he is a good man.	Míenya be enye ame nyui aɖe.
Imagine my surprise.	Bu ale si wòwɔ nuku nam la ŋu kpɔ.
I can't deal with them	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu o
But that’s not all there is to it.	Gake menye ema koe nye ema o.
I didn’t want his attention.	Nyemedi be eƒe susu nanɔ eŋu o.
He looked like himself.	Edze abe eya ŋutɔ ene.
There is a job to be done.	Dɔ aɖe li woawɔ.
It’s been a while.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia.
I wasn’t okay with them either	Nye hã menɔ nyuie le wo gbɔ o
Not many men can say that.	Ŋutsu geɖe mate ŋu agblɔ nya ma o.
I don’t want to talk about it	Nyemedi be maƒo nu tso eŋu o
I can do anything for anyone.	Mate ŋu awɔ nusianu na amesiame.
Get the weird guy out of here.	Ðe ŋutsu si mewɔ nuku o la le afisia.
I was also being realistic	Menɔ nu wɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ hã
I think he's trying	Mesusu be ele agbagba dzem
That sounds like a good point.	Ema ɖi nya nyui aɖe.
I didn’t hear from him very often.	Nyemese eƒe nya zi geɖe o.
But more than this, so much can happen in a year.	Gake wu esia la, nu geɖe ŋutɔ ate ŋu adzɔ le ƒe ɖeka me.
I had to go right there	Ele be mayi afima tututu
And everything else.	Eye nu bubu ɖesiaɖe hã.
One thing at a time.	Nu ɖeka le ɣeyiɣi ɖeka me.
When he.	Esi wò...
I want to tell what happened.	Medi be magblɔ nusi dzɔ.
Let me do this.	Mina mawɔ esia.
I knew that name from somewhere.	Menya ŋkɔ ma tso teƒe aɖe.
I can see this now.	Mete ŋu kpɔ esia fifia.
He never had any problems at all.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ eŋu kura kpɔ o.
My hand was ready for my sword.	Nye asi nɔ klalo na nye yi.
I think he did a really great job.	Mesusu be ewɔ dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
You can stay in my room.	Àte ŋu anɔ nye xɔ me.
I know what that means	Menya nusi ema fia
And in the end, it did work.	Eye mlɔeba la, ewɔ dɔ nyateƒe.
I was wondering where that went	Menɔ ɖokuinye biam be afikae nya ma yi hã
Know the room behind it.	Nya xɔ si le megbe nɛ.
The money is in people now.	Ga la le amewo me fifia.
I think you would do the same	Mesusu be wò hã nàwɔ nenema ke
We didn’t have much heart for it besides.	Dzi boo aɖeke menɔ mía si ɖe eŋu tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu o.
I can’t find my mistake.	Nyemate ŋu ake ɖe nye vodada ŋu o.
I couldn’t do this thing	Nyemete ŋu wɔ nu sia o
I can’t make a mistake	Nyemate ŋu awɔ vodada o
I don’t know what to make of you	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ tso ŋuwò o
I was just a little angry	Ðeko medo dziku vie
At the same time, some things stay the same.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me la, nu aɖewo nɔa nenema.
There was no way	Mɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o
I tried to make a phone call.	Medze agbagba be maƒo ka.
This is also not true.	Esia hã menye nyateƒe o.
He was a very great man.	Enye ame gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
However, it is not that easy.	Ke hã, mele bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe o.
But that doesn’t make much sense.	Gake susu boo aɖeke mele nya ma me o.
Or for a car.	Alo na ʋu aɖe.
I have no children.	Vi aɖeke meli nam o.
I do know better than that	Menya nu nyuie wu ema nyateƒe
I don’t have a job anymore	Dɔ megale asinye o
I want to join you	Medi be mawɔ ɖeka kpli wò
They will all be fine.	Wo katã anyo.
I had been planning this for a few months	Menɔ ɖoɖo wɔm ɖe esia ŋu ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo
I have absolutely no idea where he is	Nyemenya afisi wòle kura o
I don’t understand that.	Nyemese nya ma gɔme o.
I liked this part of it better	Eƒe akpa sia dze ŋunye wu
That worried me.	Ema tsi dzi nam.
Everything is too much.	Nusianu gbɔ eme.
I tried to move on with my life	Medze agbagba be mayi nye agbe dzi
Think about it.	Bu eŋu kpɔ.
This project could be anything	Dɔ sia ate ŋu anye nusianu
I was a little worried about it	Metsi dzi vie ɖe eŋu
I don’t want you dead	Nyemele wò ku dim o
I tried really, really hard	Medze agbagba ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ
He had never done anything right in his life.	Mewɔ naneke nyuie le eƒe agbe me kpɔ o.
It’s as simple as it gets.	Ele bɔbɔe abe alesi wòle ene.
But that is impossible.	Gake ema mate ŋu adzɔ o.
It’s a part of me.	Enye nye akpa aɖe.
I was going to die anyway	Menɔ kuku ge le mɔ sia mɔ nu
I have never been so depressed in my life.	Nyemete ɖe dzinye nenema gbegbe le nye agbe me kpɔ o.
What works for me, works for me.	Nusi wɔa dɔ nam la, wɔa dɔ nam.
I really wanted to know more	Medi vevie be manya nu geɖe wu
I can imagine them all.	Mete ŋu kpɔa wo katã le susu me.
That was really, really, really tiring.	Ema te ɖeɖi ame ŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It didn’t work very well.	Mewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ o.
Do it every year.	Wɔe ƒe sia ƒe.
I doubt a nice guy would	Meke ɖi be ŋutsu nyui aɖe awɔe nenema
It is normal to do so.	Enye nusi sɔ be woawɔ nu nenema.
Nothing came of it.	Naneke medo tso eme o.
But perhaps he can do more.	Gake ɖewohĩ ate ŋu awɔ geɖe wu.
Maybe on another day you can try again.	Ðewohĩ le ŋkeke bubu dzi la, àte ŋu ate kpɔ ake.
In time, however, the work began to move forward.	Gake le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe la, dɔa dze egɔme nɔ ŋgɔ yim.
I removed the gun, but they didn’t like that	Meɖe tu la ɖa, gake nya ma medze wo ŋu o
I have to approach this carefully	Ele nam be mate ɖe esia ŋu nyuie
People can walk to work.	Amewo ate ŋu azɔ ayi dɔme.
I look forward to meeting you soon!	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be mado go kpli wò kpuie!
I tried to do better last time.	Medze agbagba be mawɔ nu nyuie wu zi si va yi.
I’m not doing anything about it.	Nyemele naneke wɔm tso eŋu o.
I have done better	Mewɔ nu nyuie wu
I was just as busy	Nye hã menɔ dɔ dzi nenema ke
I think he will be pleased	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi nɛ
It was very impressive.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
I can’t remember much either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku nu geɖe dzi o
And they’re waiting.	Eye wole lalam.
Everything changed hands.	Nusianu trɔ asi le eŋu.
I can’t do it on my own	Nyemate ŋu awɔe le ɖokuinye si o
I’m going to lose my job.	Dɔ ge le asinye.
You’re not going to get the people you want.	Mèle ame siwo dim nèle la xɔ ge o.
This is new and everything else is old.	Esia nye nu yeye eye nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nye xoxo.
I couldn’t relax in a bad situation	Nyemete ŋu ɖe dzi ɖi le nɔnɔme gbegblẽ aɖeke me o
I should never have met him.	Mele be mado go gbeɖe o hafi.
I knew in my heart that he was alive	Menya le nye dzi me be ele agbe
It just wasn’t.	Ðeko menɔ nenema o.
That’s not a new thing.	Ema menye nu yeye o.
I had never heard of this before.	Nyemese nya sia ŋu nya kpɔ o.
I doubt he has more than one or two	Meke ɖi be esi wu ɖeka alo eve le esi
We just don’t know.	Ðeko míenya o.
We can do it, again and again, for every child here.	Míate ŋu awɔe, zi gbɔ zi geɖe, na ɖevi ɖesiaɖe le afisia.
Get angry with me.	Do dziku ɖe ŋunye.
I had no one else to talk to that summer	Ame bubu aɖeke menɔ asinye maƒo nu kplii le dzomeŋɔli ma me o
If you can, please help me.	Ne àte ŋui la, taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye.
I want to talk to you a little bit.	Medi be maƒo nu vie kpli mi.
Now that’s you.	Fifia la, wòe nye ema.
Save them all.	Ðe wo katã.
This year is no exception.	Ƒe sia hã mele eme o.
I can be a teacher	Mate ŋu anye nufiala
I felt really strongly about that	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ le nya ma ŋu
About everything, really.	Le nusianu ŋu, le nyateƒe me.
What is appropriate.	Nusi sɔ.
I’ve never seen this person before	Nyemekpɔ ame sia kpɔ o
I walked out of my room	Medo go le nye xɔ me
But that year passed quickly.	Gake ƒe ma va yi kaba.
That sort of thing is normal for these people.	Nu ma ƒomevi sɔ na ame siawo.
I know you’re trying	Menya be èle agbagba dzem
That’s why I’m so attracted to this.	Esia tae esia ƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ ɖo.
Can someone please help me.	Ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye taflatse.
One thing is clear in my mind.	Nu ɖeka me kɔ nyuie le susu me nam.
I wondered if maybe we could	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖewohĩ míate ŋui hã
He shouldn’t have one.	Mele be ɖeka nanɔ esi o.
I fell forward, right onto his neck	Medze anyi ɖe ŋgɔ, ɖe eƒe kɔ dzi tututu
I didn’t expect that to actually work	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be ema awɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I just care about you	Ðeko metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò
I wasn’t happy though.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ o ke hã.
It might take four days.	Ðewohĩ axɔ ŋkeke ene.
He looked like a strong man.	Edze abe ame sesẽ ene.
I don’t want anything to do with that.	Nyemedi be mawɔ naneke kple ema o.
Do this as you wish.	Wɔ esia alesi nèdi.
He certainly wasn’t happy.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ o godoo.
You have to keep something in mind the whole time though.	Ele be nane nanɔ susu me na wò ɣeyiɣi bliboa katã gake.
I saw something my mind couldn’t take	Mekpɔ nane si nye susu mate ŋu axɔ o
Again, we had no money.	Le afisia hã la, ga aɖeke menɔ mía si o.
The truth is simple, one way is enough.	Nyateƒea le bɔbɔe, mɔ ɖeka sɔ gbɔ.
I didn’t see anything.	Nyemekpɔ naneke o.
He was too good a person.	Enye ame nyui aɖe akpa.
It was a bad idea.	Susu gbegblẽ aɖee wònye.
I can’t be like that.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
That is quite different.	Ema to vovo kura.
That says something, really.	Ema gblɔ nya aɖe, le nyateƒe me.
A dead man’s face fell to one side	Ame kuku aɖe ƒe mo dze anyi ɖe akpa ɖeka
Try this search.	Te didi sia kpɔ.
But it will come at a difficult time.	Gake ava le ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe me.
I don’t think that’s possible	Nyemesusu be ema ate ŋu adzɔ o
I couldn’t see what he was doing	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi wɔm wònɔ o
For that matter, none of us did.	Le nya ma ta la, mía dometɔ aɖeke mewɔe nenema o.
Something is really wrong.	Nane gblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I couldn’t see them.	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ wo o.
That works well.	Ema wɔa dɔ nyuie.
I have to speak up.	Ele be maƒo nu.
There is only up or down	Dzi alo anyi koe li
I am ready to move on.	Mele klalo be mayi ŋgɔ.
It’s a good thing.	Nu nyui aɖee.
I lived through this	Menɔ agbe le esia me
He had no doubt they were there.	Meke ɖi be wole afima o.
But it doesn’t do anything.	Gake mewɔa naneke o.
Who knows what will happen.	Amekae nya nusi ava dzɔ.
Not with you.	Menye kpli wò o.
I work to live, not live to work.	Mewɔa dɔ be manɔ agbe, ke menye be manɔ agbe be mawɔ dɔ o.
I can talk to him about anything	Mate ŋu aƒo nu tso nusianu ŋu kplii
Something must be going down	Ele be nane nanɔ to yim
I do this for me.	Mewɔa esia nam.
There is a man there.	Ŋutsu aɖe le afima.
However, the situation here is different.	Ke hã, nɔnɔme si me míele le afisia la to vovo.
There was at least one other.	Bubu ɖeka ya teti nɔ anyi.
It doesn’t make sense.	Susu mele eme o.
I can do the same thing!	Nye hã mate ŋu awɔ nenema ke!
I just need time to myself	Ðeko mehiã ɣeyiɣi na ɖokuinye
Once his hand found what he was looking for, his face changed.	Esi eƒe asi ke ɖe nusi dim wònɔ ŋu ko la, eƒe mo trɔ.
It looks good now.	Edze nyuie fifia.
It is working very well.	Ele dɔ wɔm nyuie ŋutɔ.
I just got enough for myself	Ðeko mexɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ na ɖokuinye
I actually liked it a lot	Le nyateƒe me la, eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
The building completely lost its sight.	Xɔa ƒe ŋku bu kura.
There is no problem with that.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ema ŋu o.
There are some things we need to work on.	Nu aɖewo li siwo ŋu wòle be míawɔ dɔ le.
I remembered that.	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi.
I said to myself.	Megblɔ le ɖokuinye me be.
In my own way.	Le nye mɔ dzi.
There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eme o.
I don’t know much about it	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o
Not that things got any worse.	Menye be nuwo va gblẽ ɖe edzi kura o.
It might be the last time in your life.	Ðewohĩ anye zi mamlɛtɔ le wò agbe me.
I couldn’t stand that	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe nya ma nu o
I can’t live like this	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe alea o
There has to be more to it than that.	Ele be nu geɖe wu ema nanɔ anyi.

He couldn't bear to live without it.	Mete ŋu do dzi be yeanɔ anyi ema manɔmee o.
I couldn’t accept this.	Nyemete ŋu xɔ esia o.
I didn’t see what it was	Nyemekpɔ nu si wònye o
Every year, a child is disappearing.	Ƒe sia ƒe la, ɖevi aɖe le bubu yim.
Less hard work required.	Dɔ sesẽ wɔwɔ si mehiã boo o.
He was a real pleasure to work with.	Enye dzidzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
Many of them may have happened.	Ðewohĩ wo dometɔ geɖe dzɔ.
I needed a new strategy	Mehiã aɖaŋu yeye aɖe

But we know more.	Gake míenya nu geɖe wu.
Everyone is just people.	Amewo koe amesiame nye.

None of it was easy.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ bɔbɔe o.

Check them out.	Kpɔ wo ɖa.

But people are different.	Gake amewo to vovo.
I should have known this was going to happen	Ðe wòle be manya be esia ava eme hafi
I can hardly stand now at all	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te fifia kura kura o
This, of course, is the whole point.	Esia, le nyateƒe me la, enye nya bliboa.
I was hoping it would set a path for me	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be aɖo mɔ aɖe nam
I’m not sure who it is	Nyemeka ɖe amesi wònye dzi o
But this is impossible.	Gake esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.

He can escape.	Ate ŋu asi.
Now it really is.	Fifia ele nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ.

He wasn't quite sure where exactly.	Meka ɖe afi si tututu wòle la dzi tututu o.

And they might have worked.	Eye ɖewohĩ woawɔ dɔ hafi.
I was looking for something deeper	Menɔ nane si de to wu dim
I’m still not sure	Nyemeka ɖe edzi kokoko o
It has its own water.	Tsi le eya ŋutɔ si.
Nothing is legally necessary.	Naneke mehiã le se nu o.

Think about this carefully.	Bu nya sia ŋu nyuie.

I didn’t really expect him to anyway	Nyemekpɔ mɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ be awɔe nenema le mɔ aɖeke nu o
It worked for me.	Ewɔ dɔ nam.
It didn’t surprise him.	Mewɔ nuku nɛ o.

Consider the following scheme.	Bu ɖoɖo si gbɔna ŋu kpɔ.

He was just a good guy to work with.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖe koe wònye be woawɔ dɔ kplii.

Please contact us if you have any questions.	Taflatse te ɖe mía ŋu ne èle nya aɖe biam.

Think of it this way.	Bu eŋu alea.

What about his hair? 	Ke eƒe ɖa ya ɖe?
He just didn’t know who he was.	Ðeko menya amesi wònye o.

Just look at them.	Kpɔ wo ɖa ko.
Everyone in the room changed.	Amesiame si nɔ xɔa me trɔ.
I just want to know where it is	Ðeko medi be manya afi si wòle
No one else seemed to respond.	Edze abe ame bubu aɖeke mewɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu o ene.
I think you will enjoy it	Mesusu be adzɔ dzi na wò
However, something else can still kill you.	Ke hã, nu bubu aɖe ate ŋu awu wò kokoko.

There’s probably someone else out there.	Anɔ eme be ame bubu aɖe hã le afima.
I have to apologize if anything happens to her	Ele be maɖe kuku ne nane dzɔ ɖe edzi
Everyone will answer for themselves.	Ame ɖesiaɖe aɖo eŋu na eɖokui.
That’s why it’s at the car.	Esia tae wòle ʋua gbɔ ɖo.
And he can very well.	Eye ate ŋui nyuie ŋutɔ.

He was probably just the same at home.	Anɔ eme be eya hã nɔ nenema tututu le aƒeme.
That’s why he lived.	Esia tae wònɔ agbe ɖo.
I could very easily be wrong about anything else.	Mate ŋu awɔ vodada bɔbɔe ŋutɔ le nya bubu ɖesiaɖe ŋu.

I do things my own way	Mewɔa nuwo le nye ŋutɔ nye mɔ nu
I was on my own and I felt it.	Menɔ ɖokuinye si eye mese le ɖokuinye me.
I knew without a word what he was expecting	Menya nusi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm na nya aɖeke manɔmee
I have never seen a book like this before	Nyemekpɔ agbalẽ si le abe esia ene kpɔ o
It worked on its own.	Ewɔ dɔ le eɖokui si.
It should never have come.	Mele be mava gbeɖe o hafi.
I want to know what happened to them	Medi be manya nu si dzɔ ɖe wo dzi
Often, though, the opposite will happen.	Gake zi geɖe la, nusi to vovo na emae adzɔ.
But this is me.	Gake nyee nye esia.
I didn’t anticipate what would happen next	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na nusi adzɔ le ema megbe o
Give people what they want.	Na nu si amewo di la amewo.
None of them seem to work.	Edze abe wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔa dɔ o ene.
I should know better by now	Ele be manya nyuie wu esia vaseɖe fifia
I came looking for you and found you here	Meva di wò eye mekpɔ wò le afisia
This is a simple problem.	Esia nye kuxi bɔbɔe aɖe.
I felt for the gun	Mese le ɖokuinye me le tu la ta
I had someone who did all these things	Ame aɖe nɔ asinye si wɔa nu siawo katã
Attitude is everything.	Nɔnɔme nye nusianu.
I plan everything	Mewɔa ɖoɖo ɖe nusianu ŋu
The result was amazing.	Nusi do tso eme la wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
No one can really help you.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I wanted to do things differently.	Medi be mawɔ nuwo le mɔ bubu nu.
I had to do it earlier	Ele be mawɔe do ŋgɔ
The night was fine.	Zã la nɔ nyuie.
He probably won’t.	Ðewohĩ mawɔe nenema o.
He had time for everyone.	Ɣeyiɣi nɔ esi na amesiame.
Put a bullet in his heart.	De tu ɖe eƒe dzi me.
I can’t keep anything alive	Nyemate ŋu ana naneke nanɔ agbe o
That’s easy, too.	Ema hã le bɔbɔe.
But almost everything else is a lie.	Gake nu bubu ɖesiaɖe kloe nye alakpa.
I might just go home	Ðewohĩ mayi aƒeme ko
But what was behind them was different.	Gake nusi nɔ megbe na wo la to vovo.
Understand what it is like.	Se alesi wòle gɔme.
I really enjoyed it myself.	Nye ŋutɔ hã mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ.
A few more cars, but that made sense	Ʋu ʋɛ aɖewo bubu, gake susu nɔ nya ma me
It would have been great	Anyo ŋutɔ hafi
I just wanted to meet you	Ðeko medi be mado go wò
Two years ago.	Ƒe eve enye sia.
I had never heard of it	Nyemese eŋu nya kpɔ o
I got more blood	Mexɔ ʋu geɖe wu
I need you to do your part here	Mehiã be nàwɔ wò akpa dzi le afisia
I had to let it go	Ele be maɖe asi le eŋu
I wonder if this is enough for him	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe esia sɔ gbɔ nɛ hã
Which makes this so effective.	Nusi na esia wɔa dɔ alea gbegbe.
We are ready now.	Míele klalo fifia.
I remember they had a dog	Meɖo ŋku edzi be avu aɖe nɔ wo si
I can’t stay here anymore.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ afisia azɔ o.
Isn’t it interesting.	Ðe menye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame oa.
However, he is not talking about any of them.	Ke hã, mele nu ƒom tso wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o.
A few months, not more.	Ɣleti ʋɛ aɖewo, menye wu ema o.
I tried myself, many times	Mete ɖokuinye kpɔ, zi geɖe
Some men are like that.	Ŋutsu aɖewo le nenema.
I was looking for what he was looking for	Nusi dim wònɔ la dim menɔ
I wasn’t expecting that	Menye ɖe menɔ mɔ kpɔm na ema o
The meeting went very well.	Kpekpea yi edzi nyuie ŋutɔ.
It’s what he did.	Enye nusi wòwɔ.
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
He took everything there was to do.	Etsɔ nusianu si nɔ anyi be wòawɔ la ɖe asi.
And that’s my problem.	Eye emae nye nye kuxi.
He didn’t tell me anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke nam o.
This is a really weird thing.	Esia nye nusi wɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I had worked so hard.	Mewɔ dɔ sesĩe ale gbegbe kpɔ.
Some information leaked out about that person.	Nya aɖewo do go tso ame ma ŋu.
Nothing too surprising.	Naneke mewɔ nuku akpa o.
I am fighting to stay here	Mele avu wɔm be manɔ afisia
This thread is just not for me.	Ðeko ka sia menye nye tɔ o.
This was last week.	Esia nye kwasiɖa si va yi.
I had to be there one last time.	Ele be manɔ afima zi mamlɛtɔ.
There was little time left.	Ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe nɔ anyi.
It was a great moment.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe.
I think that would be a surprise to someone else, too.	Mesusu be ema hã anye nusi awɔ nuku na ame bubu.
You know what it’s like.	Ènya alesi wòle.
This result is very relevant.	Nusi do tso eme sia sɔ ŋutɔ.
I surprised him a lot.	Mewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
I should have stayed	Ðe wòle be manɔ anyi hafi
He never does this.	Mewɔa esia gbeɖe o.
That got a lot of attention.	Ema xɔ susu geɖe.
He wasn't going to say anything.	Menɔ nya aɖeke gblɔ ge o.
I don’t know where they are, or if they are	Nyemenya afi si wole, alo ne wole hã o
These people talked about us.	Ame siawo ƒo nu tso mía ŋu.
I could remember it like it was yesterday	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku edzi abe etsɔ ene
To tell you the truth, I was shocked.	Ne magblɔ nyateƒea na mi la, ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I need some things for the car	Mehiã nu aɖewo na ʋua
I want to move on and live my life	Medi be mayi ŋgɔ anɔ nye agbe
I will work on it.	Mawɔ dɔ le eŋu.
I know that kind of room	Menya xɔ ma ƒomevi
Perhaps he will understand.	Ðewohĩ ase egɔme.
He didn’t tell me anything.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke nam o.
A new, smaller home would be good news for them.	Aƒe yeye si le sue wu la anye nya nyui na wo.
He wasn’t angry with her.	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu o.
This book covers them all.	Agbalẽ sia ƒo nu tso wo katã ŋu.
I would have let you go.	Meɖe asi le ŋuwò hafi.
I don’t know how I came up with this idea	Nyemenya alesi susu sia va susu me nam o
Two people died as a result.	Ame eve ku le eya ta.
I don’t know what to do	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ o
You can’t speak against it.	Màte ŋu aƒo nu tsi tre ɖe eŋu o.
I wanted to do something a little different	Medi be mawɔ nane si to vovo vie
That makes a lot of sense.	Susu le nya ma me ŋutɔ.
Now he won’t do it.	Fifia mawɔe o.
I did enough of that on my own	Mewɔ ema sɔ gbɔ le ɖokuinye si
I saw another voice.	Mekpɔ gbe bubu aɖe.
Too many people coming home too soon.	Ame geɖe akpa siwo gbɔna aƒeme kaba akpa.
I want to do things right	Medi be mawɔ nuwo nyuie
This is a good idea.	Esia nye susu nyui aɖe.
It is very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ.
No one had ever touched him.	Ame aɖeke meka asi eŋu kpɔ o.
I’ve never seen anything like it	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o
Which would be.	Nusi anye.
I haven't had an issue in a long time	Nyemekpɔ nya aɖeke o ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia
I had no issue with that.	Nya aɖeke menɔ ŋunye le ema ŋu o.
They are all easy to do.	Wo katã wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe.
Maybe he can still live.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu anɔ agbe kokoko.
It probably won’t work anyway.	Anɔ eme be mawɔ dɔ le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I just care about you.	Ðeko metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò.
I can’t let him do that	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ nɛ wòawɔ nu ma o
I felt like doing the same thing.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mawɔ nu ma ke.
I have to make some money.	Ele nam be makpɔ ga aɖe.
I’ve done it so many times before	Mewɔe zi geɖe ŋutɔ do ŋgɔ
I’m sure everyone is ready	Meka ɖe edzi be amesiame le klalo
I never knew about this	Nyemenya nu tso esia ŋu kpɔ o
It is legally impossible.	Enye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ le se nu o.
I had to save myself.	Ele nam be maɖe ɖokuinye.
And for very little in return.	Eye ɖe nu sue aɖe ko ta le eteƒe.
Maybe he will score.	Ðewohĩ aƒo go.
That means a lot.	Ema fia nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
If you have a problem, check here.	Ne kuxi aɖe le ŋuwò la, ke kpɔ afisia.
Many people left.	Ame geɖe dzo.
He wasn’t going to retire.	Menye ɖe wònɔ dzudzɔ xɔ ge o.
I’ve never felt that way before	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o
The thing is open.	Nu la ʋu.
A child does so much	Vi aɖe wɔa nu geɖe ŋutɔ
It was a ship.	Enye meli aɖe.
This is often true.	Esia nye nyateƒe zi geɖe.
I am not giving up on us.	Menye ɖe mele asi ɖem le mía ŋu o.
He wouldn’t tell her the exact truth.	Magblɔ nyateƒea tututu nɛ o.
I don’t think I know how long he’s been talking.	Nyemesusu be menya ɣeyiɣi didi si wònɔ nu ƒom o.
There are two reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae.
I know what it’s like.	Menya alesi wòle.
He did what he had to do.	Ewɔ nusi wòle be wòawɔ.
Too much money and too little imagination.	Ga sɔ gbɔ akpa eye susu boo aɖeke mele wo si o.
Yet, it was wrong.	Ke hã nu gblẽ le eŋu.
That is very appealing to them.	Ema dzɔa dzi na wo ŋutɔ.
I don’t know why.	Nyemenya nusi tae o.
It can’t be that way.	Mate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
Like any horse.	Abe sɔ ɖesiaɖe ene.
Once a week.	Zi ɖeka le kwasiɖa me.
We know a lot about it.	Míenya nu geɖe tso eŋu.
Much like you, actually	Geɖe abe wò ene, le nyateƒe me
To make it work.	Be wòawɔ dɔ.
I promise to do better.	Medo ŋugbe be mawɔe nyuie wu.
I am ready to move forward	Mele klalo be mayi ŋgɔ
It actually happened.	Edzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t know anything at all	Nyemenya naneke kura o
I want to make a life here with you	Medi be mawɔ agbe le afisia kpli wò
I would imagine a bit of a problem.	Makpɔ kuxi aɖe le susu me vie.
I tried to tell you that	Medze agbagba be magblɔ nya ma na mi
I was there for a different reason	Susu bubu aɖe tae menɔ afima ɖo
What might happen tomorrow.	Nusi ate ŋu adzɔ etsɔ.
It didn’t do anything, really.	Mewɔ naneke o, le nyateƒe me.
I glanced down and my jaw dropped	Meɖe ŋku ɖe anyi eye nye aɖu dze anyi
In this case, a house.	Le go sia me la, aƒe aɖee.
I shouldn’t be talking to any of them	Mele be manɔ nu ƒom na wo dometɔ aɖeke o
Build on it.	Tu ɖe edzi.
I think it can hold us all up	Mesusu be ate ŋu axɔ mí katã ɖe dzi
Nothing else should matter.	Mele be nu bubu aɖeke nanɔ vevie o.
He could have won like that.	Ate ŋu aɖu dzi nenema hafi.
Or two.	Alo eve.
I can't come and see about you today	Nyemate ŋu ava kpɔ nu tso ŋuwò egbea o
I totally deserve that	Medze na ema kura
Just a little bit.	Susu aɖe ko.
I wanted to see what he could do	Medi be makpɔ nu si wòate ŋu awɔ
He was very clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ.
I was so old when everything happened	Metsi ale gbegbe esime nusianu dzɔ
Maybe it’s true but we can’t say the real reasons.	Ðewohĩ enye nyateƒe gake míate ŋu agblɔ susu ŋutɔŋutɔ siwo tae o.
But some days.	Gake ŋkeke aɖewo.
A new dawn is ahead	Ŋdi yeye aɖe le ŋgɔ gbɔna
I have no past help	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke mele asinye si va yi o
That’s probably just me	Anɔ eme be nye ɖeka koe nye ema
But it’s not his food.	Gake menye eƒe nuɖuɖu o.
I know this is hard for you	Menya be esia sesẽ na wò
It was a very nice day.	Ŋkeke nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
It’s definitely not the same thing.	Menye nu ɖeka koe wònye o godoo.
He enjoyed doing that.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ esi wònɔ nu ma wɔm.
I can see that clearly now	Mete ŋu kpɔa ema nyuie fifia
And a good thing, too.	Eye nu nyui aɖe hã.
I just can’t believe this	Ðeko nyemate ŋu axɔ esia dzi ase o
I could have escaped	Anye ne mate ŋu asi hafi
But it is private now.	Gake enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ fifia.
As it was, it was.	Abe alesi wònɔ ene.
It probably would have been about four	Anɔ eme be anɔ abe ene ene hafi
I could have done without it.	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔe esia manɔmee hafi.
The car was right.	Ʋua ƒe nya sɔ.
Many of them are different.	Wo dometɔ geɖe to vovo.
Maybe more than that.	Ðewohĩ nusi wu ema.
But it will do that.	Gake awɔe nenema.
I can’t remember a time when I didn’t want this	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku ɣeyiɣi aɖe si me medi esia o la dzi o
I have known them all before.	Menya wo katã kpɔ.
I have never seen any of these people	Nyemekpɔ ame siawo dometɔ aɖeke kpɔ o
I like what he's doing here	Nusi wɔm wòle le afisia la dzɔa dzi nam
He could never walk.	Mate ŋu azɔ gbeɖe o.
I am still the same	Nyee nye ma ke kokoko
But there were two problems with that plan.	Gake kuxi eve nɔ ɖoɖo ma ŋu.
In a nice voice.	Le gbe nyui aɖe me.
It’s wonderful, you know.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, ènya.
I don’t want that kind of life	Nyemedi agbe ma ƒomevi o
I hope you enjoyed that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ema do dzidzɔ na wò ŋutɔ.
You can do whatever you want.	Àte ŋu awɔ nu sia nu si nèdi.
Two circumstances stand out.	Nɔnɔme eve aɖewo dze ƒã.
But that didn’t last long.	Gake ema menɔ anyi didi o.
I got there early.	Meɖo afima kaba.
A month, maybe longer	Ɣleti ɖeka, ɖewohĩ didi wu ema
I am the exception.	Nyee nye amesi to vovo.
Everything took time.	Nusianu xɔ ɣeyiɣi.
I should never have gone with him	Mele be mayi kplii gbeɖe o
I resisted it.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu.
I can tell you that here	Mate ŋu agblɔ nya ma na mi le afisia
His help was detrimental to this child.	Eƒe kpekpeɖeŋu gblẽ nu le ɖevi sia ŋu.
There was no hole in it.	Do aɖeke menɔ eme o.
I'll explain.	Maɖe eme.
This didn’t surprise me at all.	Esia mewɔ nuku nam kura o.
I have no help, nothing	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke mele asinye o, naneke mele asinye o
You have a great day tomorrow.	Ŋkeke gã aɖe le asiwò etsɔ.
That’s no time at all, that’s nothing.	Ema menye ɣeyiɣi kura o, ema menye naneke o.
This wasn’t going quite as he had hoped.	Esia menɔ edzi yim abe alesi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ ene tututu o.
This means it’s not a small thing.	Esia fia be menye nusi le sue o.
This is really easy to do.	Esia wɔwɔ le bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I want more than this	Medi nu geɖe wu esia
I never wanted anything more.	Nyemedi naneke wu ema kpɔ o.
None of these things exist.	Nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke meli o.
I didn’t have any fun there	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ aɖeke le afima o
I have told you all this before	Megblɔ nya siawo katã na mi do ŋgɔ
Time is short.	Ɣeyiɣi le kpuie.
Come on, get your mind off it.	Va, ɖe wò susu ɖa le eŋu.
I had to talk sense into it	Ele be maƒo nu si me susu le ɖe eme
I need something more though.	Mehiã nane si wu ema gake.
I am not like that.	Nyemele nenema o.
I will take his life	Maɖe eƒe agbe ɖa
Perhaps it is surprising.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I told him everything.	Megblɔ nya sia nya nɛ.
I'll be out of here soon	Mado le afisia kpuie
I touched his face.	Meka asi eƒe mo ŋu.
Look at that money.	Kpɔ ga ma ɖa.
I can’t do this anymore.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia azɔ o.
That's out.	Ema do go.
He couldn't speak.	Mete ŋu ƒo nu o.
There is no other there.	Bubu aɖeke mele afima o.
After all, it was just yesterday.	Le nyateƒe me la, etsɔ koe wònye.
Doing so may speed up this route too much.	Ðewohĩ esia wɔwɔ ana mɔ sia nawɔ kaba akpa.
We are going backwards as it is.	Míele megbe yim abe alesi wòle ene.
I want to be wherever you are	Medi be manɔ afi sia afi si nèle
And he did, too.	Eye eya hã wɔe nenema.
It will be fine, of course.	Anɔ nyuie ya.
I'm just not sure what to do with it yet	Ðeko nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ kplii dzi haɖe o
Thank you in advance.	Akpe na mi do ŋgɔ.
I had understood everything	Mese nusianu gɔme kpɔ
He's new here.	Enye ame yeye le afisia.
In this place.	Le teƒe sia.
They had a job to do.	Dɔ aɖe nɔ wo si woawɔ.
His people were here.	Eƒe amewo nɔ afisia.
I really enjoyed myself here.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ le afisia.
I have done this over and over again	Mewɔ esia zi gbɔ zi geɖe
I usually rule that no one is inside	Zi geɖe la, mewɔa se be ame aɖeke mele eme o
He could have done it.	Ate ŋu awɔe hafi.
I am busy right now anyway.	Vovo mele ŋunye fifia le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I'm talking to everyone who saw this	Mele nu ƒom na amesiame si kpɔ esia
There was very little air.	Ya sue aɖe koe nɔ anyi.
I don’t really have anything	Naneke mele asinye ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I have to keep standing firm	Ele be mayi edzi anɔ te sesĩe
I can’t hear a voice	Nyemate ŋu ase gbe aɖeke o
Only one word is needed.	Nya ɖeka koe hiã.
Make every lie.	Wɔ alakpa ɖesiaɖe.
We do know each other.	Míenya mía nɔewo ya.
This place is amazing.	Teƒe sia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I don’t know what kind of situation he’s in	Nyemenya nɔnɔme si ƒomevi me wòle o
It is so impossible.	Enye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o ale gbegbe.
Which he didn’t.	Nusi mewɔe o.
I want to say thank you.	Medi be magblɔ akpe na.
I couldn’t have done this without you	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia wò manɔmee o
It is working as it is now.	Ele dɔ wɔm abe alesi wòle fifia ene.
I don’t know what that means	Nyemenya nusi ema fia o
The car turned around.	Ʋua trɔ dzo.
I ended up in a pool of blood	Meva wu enu ɖe ​​ʋu ƒe ta aɖe me
Nothing is the same now.	Naneke megale abe tsã ene fifia o.

There is no place home.	Teƒe aɖeke meli aƒe o.
There are only a few of them.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe li.
He was not a strong man.	Menye ame sesẽ aɖee wònye o.
He really did a great job	Ewɔ dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ
I need to find my room	Ele be madi nye xɔ
That’s why he didn’t approach her.	Esia tae mete ɖe eŋu o ɖo.
I want to talk about you.	Medi be maƒo nu tso ŋuwò.
I know you will enjoy it	Menya be adzɔ dzi na wò ŋutɔ
I certainly can’t find any right now	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ɖeke fifia o godoo
I arrived at that moment, to their surprise	Meva ɖo le ɣeyiɣi ma me, si wɔ nuku na wo
I stayed there for an hour	Menɔ afima gaƒoƒo ɖeka
Now this happened.	Fifia esia dzɔ.
I can imagine your surprise	Mete ŋu kpɔ alesi wòwɔ nuku na wò la le susu me
You are not that important.	Mèle vevie nenema gbegbe o.
I am like that anyway.	Mele nenema le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I think that makes it a challenge	Mesusu be ema na wònye kuxi
All kinds of things can happen.	Nu ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe ate ŋu adzɔ.
But they are only legally so.	Gake wole nenema le se nu ko.
He can take care of himself.	Ate ŋu akpɔ eɖokui dzi.
I know what’s bothering him	Menya nusi le fu ɖem nɛ
I really need some help.	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
What to do with it.	Nusi woawɔ kplii.
I can’t tell you how much this has meant to you	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ alesi gbegbe esia ɖe vi na wò o
Please give your dog water and food.	Taflatse na tsi kple nuɖuɖu wò avu.
A lot of people really hit me up about it.	Ame geɖe ƒo ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔŋutɔ le eŋu.
I liked everything about that city	Du ma me nusianu dze ŋunye
There was still blood on his big hand.	Ʋu gakpɔtɔ nɔ eƒe asi gã la dzi.
He wasn’t in a hurry.	Menye ɖe wònɔ du dzi o.
But there was never anything there.	Gake naneke menɔ afima kpɔ o.
I can do anything, go anywhere	Mate ŋu awɔ nusianu, ayi afi sia afi
And it was very impressive.	Eye wòwɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ.
I have something else that might interest you	Nu bubu aɖe hã le asinye si ate ŋu adzɔ dzi na wò
He didn’t say what to do.	Megblɔ nusi woawɔ o.
It’s not just a part of it.	Menye eƒe akpa aɖe ko o.
This may be the case.	Esia ate ŋu anɔ alea.
That’s neither here nor there right now.	Ema mele afisia alo afima fifia o.
It’s not the right thing to do.	Menye nusi sɔ o.
I definitely saw that of course	Mekpɔ ema godoo nyateƒe
Perhaps the work has already begun.	Ðewohĩ dɔa dze egɔme xoxo.
Something like that.	Nane si le abe ema ene.
I think he can do it	Mesusu be ate ŋu awɔe
Every night.	Zã sia zã.
A month is a long time in a dog’s life.	Ɣleti ɖeka nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe le avu ƒe agbe me.
I can’t see them now	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wo fifia o

So far it’s been fantastic.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
You are here, closer than ever.	Èle afisia, te ɖe eŋu wu tsã.
He never really did.	Mewɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔ o.

Not in any way.	Menye mɔ aɖeke dzi o.
I got closer to get a better look	Mete ɖe eŋu wu be makpɔ nu nyuie wu
Use any system for you.	Zã ɖoɖo ɖesiaɖe na wò.
He just couldn't figure out what.	Ðeko mete ŋu bu nusi ka ŋu o.

I can’t make that promise.	Nyemate ŋu ado ŋugbe ma o.

I can’t believe how much she has done in the house.	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nu geɖe si wòwɔ le aƒea me la dzi ase o.
It wouldn’t bother me at all	Maɖe fu nam kura o

He was an interesting guy.	Enye ŋutsu si doa dzidzɔ na ame.

You know what’s coming up.	Ènya nusi le ŋgɔ gbɔna.
But not for long.	Gake menye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖeke o.
So did the plaintiff.	Nenema ke amesi tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu hã wɔe.
I took that away from him	Meɖe ema le esi
That will take time.	Ema axɔ ɣeyiɣi.
I care deeply about you and always have	Metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò ŋutɔ eye metsɔ ɖe le eme na wò ɣesiaɣi
This is his own.	Esia nye eya ŋutɔ tɔ.
Try them out.	Te wo kpɔ.
I just need to talk to you a bit.	Ðeko wòle be maƒo nu kpli wò vie.
I just met this guy yesterday	Ðeko medo go ŋutsu sia etsɔ koe nye ema
I needed to talk to him	Ehiã be maƒo nu kplii
I told him it was impossible	Megblɔ nɛ be manya wɔ o
He wasn’t the only one.	Menye eya ɖeka koe o.
I have absolutely no time for anything else at all	Ɣeyiɣi mele asinye kura na nu bubu aɖeke kura o
Lots of work, lots of work going on.	Dɔ geɖe, dɔ geɖe le edzi yim.
I wanted to tell him that, but I resisted	Medi be magblɔ nya ma nɛ, gake metsi tre ɖe eŋu
I would take every child out of the car every morning.	Maɖe ɖevi ɖesiaɖe le ʋua me ŋdi sia ŋdi.
I needed that for me.	Mehiã ema nam.
I couldn’t go.	Nyemete ŋu yi o.
I did it like this.	Mewɔe abe esia ene.
I did what anyone would do	Mewɔ nusi ame aɖe awɔ
I got out of the car	Medo go le ʋua me
I can’t imagine anything else	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nu bubu aɖeke le susu me o
Now he was tired.	Fifia ɖeɖi te eŋu.
I have some good news	Nya nyui aɖewo le asinye
Hours and hours.	Gaƒoƒo kple gaƒoƒo.
He doesn’t know what this guy knows.	Menya nusi ŋutsu sia nya o.
It really is no problem at all.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye kuxi aɖeke kura o.
That's me.	Nyee nye ema.
I need the police.	Mehiã kpovitɔwo.
I want to see this for myself	Medi be nye ŋutɔ makpɔ esia
After all, it’s all in one place.	Le nyateƒe me la, teƒe ɖeka koe wo katã wole.
I wasn’t the one who represented him	Menye nyee nye ame si nɔ eteƒe nɛ o
It should impress me	Ele be wòawɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye
I want to do this with him	Medi be mawɔ esia kplii
You can’t be like that.	Màte ŋu anɔ nenema o.
Another suddenly occurred to him	Bubu aɖe va susu me nɛ zi ɖeka
I think you’re ready	Mesusu be èle klalo
I think you can tell a lot from that.	Mesusu be àte ŋu anya nu geɖe tso ema me.
I can tell you that it all really worked	Mate ŋu agblɔ na mi be wo katã wɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ
I just couldn’t remember them	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku wo dzi o
It was very pleasant to him.	Edzɔ dzi nɛ ŋutɔ.
But it didn’t annoy me in any way.	Gake medo dziku nam le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
I was so glad to be home	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be meva aƒeme
It is a kind of water.	Enye tsi ƒomevi aɖe.
At least one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka ya teti.
I did my job.	Mewɔ nye dɔa.
But there is nothing like what happened today.	Gake ɖeke meli si sɔ kple nusi dzɔ egbea o.
I wish I had remembered someone so beautiful	Anye ne meɖo ŋku ame aɖe si nya kpɔ nenema gbegbe dzi hafi
I knew this was just one night.	Menya be zã ɖeka koe esia nye.
Get out of it.	Do go le eme.
That wouldn’t work.	Ema mawɔ dɔ o.
And the night passed.	Eye zã la va yi.
I want to work on some songs	Medi be mawɔ dɔ tso ha aɖewo ŋu
I was more nervous than that	Metsi dzodzodzoe wu ema
He liked that idea.	Susu ma dze eŋu.
I will do whatever you want.	Mawɔ nu sia nu si nèdi.
This year is different.	Ƒe sia to vovo.
I know what needs to be done	Menya nusi wòle be woawɔ
When someone goes off a meal.	Ne ame aɖe do le nuɖuɖu me.
I think there is some truth to this.	Mesusu be nyateƒe aɖe le esia ŋu.
He is taking care of it.	Ele edzi kpɔm.
Check them all out here.	Kpɔ wo katã ɖa le afisia.
But he is doing great.	Gake ele nu gã aɖe wɔm.
Everything fell well.	Nusianu dze anyi nyuie.
You had nothing.	Naneke menɔ asiwò o.
At that moment, an idea came to me.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me la, susu aɖe va susu me nam.
It is a work in progress.	Enye dɔ si le edzi yim.
I suggest that .	Meɖo aɖaŋu be .
You can’t get rid of them.	Màte ŋu aɖe wo ɖa o.
But he never came home.	Gake meva aƒeme kpɔ o.
To act like someone else might not.	Be woawɔ nu abe ame bubu ene la, ɖewohĩ mawɔe o.
I think that and more	Mesusu be ema kple nusi wu ema
Death was here.	Ku nɔ afisia.
I have a discovery process	Nuwo didi ƒe ɖoɖo aɖe le asinye
However, time is money.	Ke hã, ɣeyiɣi nye ga.
I wonder why he is acting this way	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae wòle nu wɔm alea hã
I have this song.	Ha sia le asinye.
He didn’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke menɔ esi o.
I really liked this place.	Teƒe sia dzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
Now, that was a good fight.	Azɔ, avu nyui aɖee nye ema.
A man who will never really exist	Ŋutsu si manɔ anyi ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o
It’s just not there anymore.	Ðeko megale afima o.
I just don’t know what to do though	Ðeko nyemenya nusi mawɔ o ke hã
You have no idea.	Susu aɖeke mele asiwò o.
I hope this continues week after week	Mele mɔ kpɔm be esia ayi edzi kwasiɖa sia kwasiɖa
I just did it for you	Mewɔe na wò ko
I hope he can stay there	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ate ŋu anɔ afima
I was way ahead of him	Menɔ ŋgɔ nɛ ŋutɔ
I can’t do it for you	Nyemate ŋu awɔe na wò o
I knew something was seriously going on	Menya be nane le edzi yim vevie
I was nervous after his death	Metsi dzodzodzoe le eƒe ku megbe
I had a bit of a night last night	Mekpɔ zã aɖe vie le zã si va yi me
He seems to be in good shape.	Edze abe ele nɔnɔme nyui aɖe me ene.
He had a house now.	Aƒe nɔ esi fifia.
I want to know if that kid went anywhere	Medi be manya ne ɖevi ma yi afi aɖe
I wanted to say that for so long	Medi be magblɔ nya ma ɣeyiɣi didi alea gbegbe
I do what you have to do	Mewɔa nu si wòle be nàwɔ
I can see you as her too	Mate ŋu akpɔ wò abe eya hã ene
But I was in really good shape	Gake menɔ nɔnɔme nyui aɖe me ŋutɔŋutɔ
Here are just a few of them.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo koe nye esi.
I was the first to speak	Nyee nye ame gbãtɔ si ƒo nu
But there is something else.	Gake nu bubu aɖe hã li.
I wonder which one it is.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be wo dometɔ kae wònye hã.
That’s you, or your people.	Emae nye wò, alo wò amewo.
This is just too much .	Ðeko esia nye nusi sɔ gbɔ wu .
I am looking for the truth.	Mele nyateƒea dim.
I gave you to them, a long time ago	Metsɔ wò na wo, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia
This didn’t work.	Esia mewɔ dɔ o.
He didn’t want anything.	Medi naneke o.
This is just too much.	Ðeko esia sɔ gbɔ akpa.
He was a good guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖee wònye.
I have never enjoyed it so much.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
That seems obvious.	Edze abe nya ma dze ƒã ene.
I felt my heart harden overnight	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi sesẽ le zã ɖeka me
Why it isn't working.	Nusita mele dɔ wɔm o.
I thought it was impossible	Mesusu be manya wɔ o
This is a good thing	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe
Actually, two things.	Le nyateƒe me la, nu eve.
I knew he would do that	Menya be awɔe nenema
I have a lot to do today.	Nu geɖe le asinye mawɔ egbea.
And he can do it right here	Eye ate ŋu awɔe le afisia tututu
I had to make a promise	Ele be mado ŋugbe aɖe
But it’s a good news.	Gake nya nyui aɖee.
And this looks like it could be one of them.	Eye esia dze abe ate ŋu anye wo dometɔ ɖeka ene.
It doesn’t really matter, of course.	Mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o ya.
I said that’s fine with me.	Megblɔ be esia nyo nam.
It will hit right through you.	Aƒo to ŋuwò tututu.
The building also assumed its present name	Xɔa hã xɔ ŋkɔ si le eŋu fifia
And no one else could come close.	Eye ame bubu aɖeke mete ŋu te ɖe eŋu o.
So far all was going well.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nuwo katã nɔ edzi yim nyuie.
I think that should be fine	Mesusu be ele be ema nanɔ nyuie
He will act like a man.	Awɔ nu abe ŋutsu ene.
I was a little worried about it.	Metsi dzi vie ɖe eŋu.
That’s part of that.	Ema ƒe akpa aɖee nye ema.
Maintain a long pose.	Lé nɔnɔme didi aɖe me ɖe asi.
I think that’s a good idea	Mesusu be susu nyui aɖee nye ema
He was obviously a really great guy.	Edze ƒã be enye ame gã ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t know anything about it.	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o.
I only got them for a day or two	Ŋkeke ɖeka alo eve koe mexɔ wo
There is nothing wrong with it.	Vodada aɖeke mele eŋu o.
If what happened happened.	Nenye be nusi dzɔ la dzɔ.
In a loud voice.	Le gbe sesẽ aɖe me.
It was a great moment for me.	Enye ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe nam.
I did listen carefully	Meɖo to nyuie nyateƒe
Please, help him.	Taflatse, kpe ɖe eŋu.
I don’t have a voice.	Gbe aɖeke mele asinye o.
I know you can do anything	Menya be àte ŋu awɔ nusianu
I always wonder how you are	Mebiaa ɖokuinye ɣesiaɣi be aleke nèle hã
I was more nervous than ever	Metsi dzodzodzoe wu tsã
I never saw anyone else but you	Nyemekpɔ ame bubu aɖeke kpɔ o, wò koe
If you know, you can’t do it.	Ne ènya la, màte ŋu awɔe o.
I really need you, one last time	Mehiã wò ŋutɔŋutɔ, zi mamlɛtɔ
I was on a ship a few times	Menɔ meli aɖe me zi ʋɛ aɖewo
I want a little time with you	Medi be ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe nanɔ anyi kpli wò
I’m against myself.	Nye ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu.
But he never did that.	Gake mewɔe nenema gbeɖe o.
I have to comply with it	Ele be mawɔ ɖe edzi
I am sure it will be	Meka ɖe edzi be anɔ nenema
But in a negative way.	Gake le mɔ gbegblẽ nu.
A bullet went through his head	Tu aɖe to ta me
I know more than enough.	Menya nu geɖe wu.
But speak reasonably to him.	Gake ƒo nu si me susu le nɛ.
Haven't done that in a long time.	Mewɔe nenema o ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia.
We can see so much.	Míate ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
No one has ever seen you.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ wò kpɔ o.
I'm here	Meva le mo
I would be fine without him	Manɔ nyuie eya manɔmee
Something in my head just wouldn’t work.	Ðeko nane nɔ nye ta me si mawɔ dɔ o.
But this book is different.	Gake agbalẽ sia ya to vovo.
They will not be discouraged.	Dzi maɖe le wo ƒo o.
He seems to want to manage it himself.	Edze abe eya ŋutɔ adi be yeakpɔ edzi ene.
I did the same in the same situation	Mewɔ nenema ke le nɔnɔme ma ke me
I have been waiting for this moment for years	Mele ɣeyiɣi sia lalam ƒe geɖe
He is not a talkative person.	Menye ame si ƒoa nu o.
There was something else about this dog.	Nu bubu aɖe nɔ avu sia ŋu.
The same positive result.	Nu nyui ma ke do tso eme.
He was very sick.	Edze dɔ ŋutɔ.
He was a good guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖee wònye.
In one night.	Le zã ɖeka me.
I felt very strongly for a very long time	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ŋutɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ
It’s been good to me in that way.	Ewɔ nyui nam le mɔ ma nu.
I could understand it.	Mete ŋu se egɔme.
I couldn’t help but feel a little better	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o, gake nye dzi dze eme vie
I have nothing on it yet.	Naneke mele asinye le eŋu haɖe o.
It touched a place in my heart.	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe teƒe aɖe dzi le nye dzi me.
I’m not with anyone.	Nyemele ame aɖeke gbɔ o.
I was just worried.	Ðeko metsi dzi.
But not more than that.	Gake menye nusi wu ema o.
More than a little annoying	Menye nusi do dziku nam vie ko o
Everyone has them.	Wo le amesiame si.
I never wanted a big machine	Nyemedi mɔ̃ gã aɖeke gbeɖe o
I can tell him anything	Mate ŋu agblɔ nusianu nɛ
This is a mistake.	Esia nye vodada.
There is nothing else in it	Nu bubu aɖeke mele eme o
I do remember that.	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi nyateƒe.
It could take at least a year or more.	Ate ŋu axɔ ƒe ɖeka alo esi wu nenema ya teti.
We can only do so much.	Nu geɖe koe míate ŋu awɔ.
That might explain it.	Ema ate ŋu aɖe eme.
I have a good plan for that	Mewɔ ɖoɖo nyui aɖe ɖe ema ŋu
To this day, no one knows exactly why.	Vaseɖe egbea la, ame aɖeke menya nusita tututu o.
It’s how to make things work for where you are.	Enye alesi nàwɔ ana nuwo nawɔ dɔ ɖe afi si nèle nu.
That’s enough for me.	Ema sɔ gbɔ nam.
I had to go with him.	Ele be mayi kplii.
I can handle whatever it is.	Mete ŋu kpɔa nusianu si wònye la gbɔ.
But I can’t say that	Gake nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma o
It can be a real trap.	Ate ŋu anye mɔ̃ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I had very little space to myself.	Teƒe sue aɖe koe nɔ asinye na ɖokuinye.
I couldn’t stand near or near anyone	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe ame aɖeke gbɔ alo ate ɖe eŋu o
I shouldn’t have let you	Mele be maɖe mɔ na wò hafi o
I am in your hands.	Nyee le asiwò.

A long time passed this way.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe va yi le mɔ sia nu.
I know when they struggle	Menya ne wole avu wɔm
Maybe he was talking to me as well.	Ðewohĩ eya hã nɔ nu ƒom nam nenema ke.
Honestly, I don’t think he’ll remember, anyway	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemesusu be aɖo ŋku edzi o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu
I would like to tell him that	Madi be magblɔ nya ma nɛ
I might have something for you	Ðewohĩ nane anɔ asinye na wò
I know you have some things to do	Menya be nu aɖewo le asiwò nàwɔ
None of it mattered in any way.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menɔ vevie le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
There might not be anything there.	Ðewohĩ naneke manɔ afima o.
I was so angry with myself	Medo dziku ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu ale gbegbe
I think he’s smart	Mesusu be edze aɖaŋu
In his heart.	Le eƒe dzi me.
He is doing the right thing.	Ele nu nyui wɔm.
I just had to say something, and it wouldn’t be surprising	Ðeko wòle be magblɔ nya aɖe, eye mawɔ nuku o
This is very damaging.	Esia gblẽ nu ŋutɔ.
Go to the people who need you.	Yi ame siwo hiã wò la gbɔ.

It does make sense in a way.	Susu le eme nyateƒe le mɔ aɖe nu.
Making good law is not my job.	Se nyui wɔwɔ menye nye dɔ o.

It didn’t seem to bother them.	Edze abe meɖe fu na wo o ene.
I wonder who that guy is	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be amekae ŋutsu ma nye hã
A word flashed through his mind	Nya aɖe ƒo ɖe eƒe susu me
I ask about his personal life.	Mebiaa nya tso eya ŋutɔ ƒe agbe ŋu.
I was the only one here	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ afisia
Now it’s starting.	Fifia edze egɔme.
It was too much for him.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ nɛ akpa.
However, there were two plans.	Ke hã, ɖoɖo eve nɔ anyi.

The simple life is great.	Agbe si le bɔbɔe la nyo ŋutɔ.
I hope something happens soon	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nane ava eme kpuie

I should say a bit more about that, perhaps	Ele be magblɔ nya geɖe tso ema ŋu vie, ɖewohĩ
No problems so far.	Kuxi aɖeke meli vaseɖe fifia o.

Everyone seems to have to fight.	Edze abe ele be amesiame nawɔ avu ene.
There is no way he is going through life.	Mɔ aɖeke meli si dzi wòle agbe tom le o.

In fact, he did just the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, ewɔ nusi to vovo kura na ema.

Get out on my own.	Do go le ɖokuinye si.
And there is no lie.	Eye alakpa aɖeke meli o.
But you can’t do it.	Gake màte ŋui o.
I don’t know who that is.	Nyemenya amesi nye ema o.
I had a lot of work for him	Dɔ geɖe nɔ asinye nɛ
I can always count on you	Mate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe ŋuwò ɣesiaɣi
You can do it.	Àte ŋu awɔe.
It’s weird, but it will warm him up soon.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, gake ado dzo nɛ kpuie.
Is it the truth.	Ðe wònye nyateƒea.
I couldn’t let go either	Nye hã nyemete ŋu ɖe asi le eŋu o
I would love to just stay that way.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be manɔ nenema ko.
I can take care of myself	Mate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye dzi
Dust settled on his face.	Ke ƒo ɖe eƒe mo.
A lot of work though	Dɔ geɖe wɔwɔ gake
You just have to be surprised	Ðeko wòle be nàwɔ nuku na wò
It was too much.	Enye nusi sɔ gbɔ akpa.
I had to act quickly	Ele nam be mawɔ nu kaba
And there is another one.	Eye bubu aɖe hã li.
He never did and he never will.	Mewɔe kpɔ o eye mawɔe hã gbeɖe o.
It never really started	Medze egɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ gbeɖe o
I heard people talking.	Mese amewo nɔ nu ƒom.
That used to be too close.	Ema te ɖe ame ŋu akpa tsã.
But I believe in you	Gake mexɔ wò dzi se
I couldn’t reach any of them.	Nyemete ŋu ɖo wo dometɔ aɖeke gbɔ o.
I wonder what it is	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae wònye hã
This is a good plan.	Esia nye ɖoɖo nyui aɖe.
I had to go that way, anyway	Ele be mayi mɔ ma dzi, le mɔ sia mɔ nu
But he never said anything to us.	Gake megblɔ nya aɖeke na mí kpɔ o.
It was very impressive .	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi ŋutɔ .
I have things to do and places to go.	Nuwo le asinye mawɔ kple teƒe siwo mayi.
Put your gun away.	Tsɔ wò tu la da ɖe teƒe aɖe.
I want to find my home	Medi be makpɔ nye aƒe
We don’t know what’s going to happen.	Míenya nusi ava dzɔ o.
I want to be in it.	Medi be manɔ eme.
You can play music for them.	Àte ŋu aƒo ha na wo.
I just couldn’t find any.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ke ɖe ɖeke ŋu o.
Or he did something else.	Alo ewɔ nu bubu aɖe.
I can’t say enough good things about the people there	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya nyui siwo sɔ gbɔ tso ame siwo le afima ŋu o
And now that day is here.	Eye azɔ ŋkeke ma ɖo afisia.
I remember it very well.	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie ŋutɔ.
I don’t understand the following	Nyemese nya si gbɔna la gɔme o
But many problems remain.	Gake kuxi geɖe gakpɔtɔ li.
Sign up today!.	De asi agbalẽ te egbea!.
I want to tell you something	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖe na mi
Again, this is not possible.	Le afisia hã la, esia mate ŋu adzɔ o.
I put you in this.	Metsɔ wò de esia me.
I just hope no one shows up	Ðeko mele mɔ kpɔm be ame aɖeke mava o
For many reasons, that was just a bad idea.	Le susu geɖe ta la, susu gbegblẽ aɖe koe ema nye.
But he couldn’t escape.	Gake mete ŋu si le eme o.
At this point, everything changed.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me la, nusianu trɔ.
This was not expected.	Menye esia nɔ mɔ kpɔm na o.
I doubt this.	Meke ɖi nya sia.
It will make me very happy.	Ana makpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
I could never see myself doing that	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ ɖokuinye le nu ma wɔm gbeɖe o
I was ready for that life	Menɔ klalo na agbe ma
He’s that clever.	Edze aɖaŋu nenema.
This is certainly possible.	Esia ate ŋu adzɔ godoo.
I know what it could be	Menya nusi wòate ŋu anye
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I should never have told him that	Mele be magblɔ nya ma nɛ gbeɖe o
I’m the little one.	Nyee nye sue.
We have many reasons why.	Susu geɖe le mía si siwo tae.
He doesn’t do that.	Mewɔa nu ma o.
I wanted to know what was going on there	Medi be manya nusi nɔ edzi yim le afima
Without them he had nothing.	Wo manɔmee la, naneke menɔ esi o.
I plan to do that every other day.	Meɖoe be mawɔ ema ŋkeke eve ɖesiaɖe.
That got attention.	Ema na amewo ƒe susu va nɔ eŋu.
His voice was kind.	Eƒe gbe nyo dɔme.
I just want the truth	Nyateƒea koe medi
I was shocked and surprised	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ eye wòwɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
By the back of your tongue.	To wò aɖe ƒe megbe.
I know where he lived	Menya afisi wònɔ
Everyone was still busy.	Amesiame gakpɔtɔ nɔ dɔ dzi vevie.
I can’t tell you what to do	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi nàwɔ na wò o
I can do that.	Mate ŋu awɔ ema.
I didn’t know he was here.	Nyemenya be ele afisia o.
Night fell into the night.	Zã va ge ɖe eme.
We had enough money.	Ga si sɔ gbɔ nɔ mía si.
I should have said something better	Ðe wòle be magblɔ nya aɖe si nyo wu hafi
He could never inherit anything.	Mate ŋu anyi naneke ƒe dome gbeɖe o.
Start your own thread.	Dze wò ŋutɔ wò ka gɔme.
I think it’s all wonderful	Mesusu be esia katã wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
I was finally able to make it work.	Mete ŋu na wòwɔ dɔ mlɔeba.
No one is going to die.	Ame aɖeke mele kuku ge o.
I trust everyone who wears his name	Meka ɖe amesiame si doa eƒe ŋkɔ dzi
I know almost every person in every household	Menya ame ɖesiaɖe kloe si le aƒe ɖesiaɖe me
There were thousands of us there.	Mí ame akpe geɖe nɔ afima.
It’s really amazing	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔŋutɔ
Come back here.	Trɔ va afisia.
But he liked you.	Gake wò nu lé dzi nɛ.
I have no problem with this system	Kuxi aɖeke mele asinye le ɖoɖo sia ŋu o
. . . .	.
You usually have two.	Zi geɖe la, eve nɔa asiwò.
I think he was surprised that anyone needed one	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku nɛ be ame aɖe hiã ɖeka
I can’t stand this.	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi le esia nu o.
It’s really important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Fire will do two things.	Dzo awɔ nu eve.
I need to be somewhere better than water	Ele be manɔ teƒe aɖe si nyo wu tsi
That takes time.	Ema bia ɣeyiɣi.
I don’t know about this	Nyemenya nu tso esia ŋu o
It could have happened anywhere.	Ate ŋu adzɔ le afi sia afi hafi.
Ha ha ha ha.	Ha ha ha ha.
This can take hours	Esia ate ŋu axɔ gaƒoƒo geɖe
For some reason, it doesn’t exist.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, meli o.
I am curious about it now	Medi vevie be manya nu tso eŋu fifia
I am really trying	Mele agbagba dzem ŋutɔŋutɔ
I have something after this	Nane le asinye le esia megbe
I know it’s only temporary	Menya be ɣeyiɣi aɖe koe wònye
But it is definitely a situation.	Gake nɔnɔme aɖee wònye godoo.
I enjoyed every aspect of the process	Dɔa wɔwɔ ƒe akpa ɖesiaɖe do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
It is not impossible .	Menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o .
And my anger is real.	Eye nye dziku la nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And that’s still hard.	Eye ema gakpɔtɔ sesẽ.
But he had a hard life.	Gake agbe sesẽ aɖe nɔ esi.
But it will be different.	Gake anye nusi to vovo.
I'm really interested in these kinds of things.	Metsɔ ɖe le nu siawo ƒomevi me ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I did understand it.	Mese egɔme nyateƒe.
The heart speaks to us when we are there.	Dzi la ƒoa nu na mí ne míele afima.
Perhaps they are.	Ðewohĩ wole nenema.
I'm in your room shooting you.	Mele wò xɔ me tu wò.
But thank you, guys.	Gake akpe na wò.
I have to keep living	Ele be mayi edzi anɔ agbe
He never denied it.	Megbe nu le eŋu kpɔ o.
Some help for me.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖewo nam.
It can be annoying.	Ate ŋu ado dziku na amewo.
I needed to talk to him.	Ehiã be maƒo nu kplii.
I just joined him.	Ðeko meva kpe ɖe eŋu.
I don’t know if this went on for very long.	Nyemenya nenye be esia yi edzi ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ o.
But it seems like a long time ago.	Gake edze nam abe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye ema ene.
I need help from all of you	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu tso mi katã gbɔ
They seemed to be waiting for something.	Edze abe ɖe wole nane lalam ene.
But consider other possibilities.	Gake bu nu bubu siwo ate ŋu adzɔ hã ŋu kpɔ.
I can’t do that to him	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma ɖe eŋu o
It was a job he never delegated.	Enye dɔ si metsɔ de asi na ame aɖeke gbeɖe o.
I know a lot from home.	Menya nu geɖe tso aƒeme.
But that doesn’t make sense.	Gake susu mele nya ma me o.
I too have been alive for a very very long time	Nye hã mele agbe ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ ŋutɔ
His name, my name.	Eƒe ŋkɔ, nye ŋkɔ.
I've already put in a little bit of it	Metsɔ eƒe akpa sue aɖe de eme xoxo
Visualize everything going well.	Kpɔ nusianu si le edzi yim nyuie le susu me.
These two are interesting.	Ame eve siawo doa dzidzɔ na ame.
I like the element of surprise	Nusi nye nusi wɔa nuku na ame la dzɔa dzi nam
No one knows anything.	Ame aɖeke menya naneke o.
It will always be a part of me.	Anye nye akpa aɖe ɣesiaɣi.
I don’t like this, not a little bit	Nya sia medze ŋunye o, menye nu sue aɖe hã o
This result is the opposite.	Nusi do tso eme sia to vovo na nusi do tso eme.
Get in the mood.	Dze dɔme.
I hope the same for you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na nenema ke na wò hã.
I was in school, of course.	Menɔ suku ya.
I felt like he didn’t understand	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mese egɔme o
Not the whole time, of course.	Menye ɣeyiɣi bliboa katã o ya.
It is certainly possible.	Ate ŋu adzɔ godoo.
He never laid hands on anyone.	Medo asi ɖe ame aɖeke dzi kpɔ o.
I like things nice and simple.	Nu siwo nyo eye wole bɔbɔe la dzɔa dzi nam.
He could hardly believe his ears.	Mete ŋu xɔ eƒe to dzi se kura o.
I know every dog’s name	Menya avu ɖesiaɖe ƒe ŋkɔ
I have to do the same thing	Ele be nye hã mawɔ nu ma ke
What you have in your hands.	Nu si le asiwò.
Not anyone else.	Menye ame bubu aɖeke o.
I didn’t want to fight him	Nyemedi be mawɔ avu kplii o
Which is so weird.	Nukae nye nusi wɔ nuku alea gbegbe.
That’s similar to each other.	Ema sɔ kple mía nɔewo.
I objected to that.	Metsi tre ɖe nya ma ŋu.
He took what he could find but wasn't too worried about it.	Etsɔ nusi wòate ŋu akpɔ gake metsi dzi ɖe eŋu boo o.
I really enjoyed that book	Agbalẽ ma do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
What’s that old saying?.	Nukae nye nya xoxo ma?.
I did what needed to be done	Mewɔ nusi wòle be woawɔ
Every face is new.	Mo ɖesiaɖe nye nu yeye.
I only saw you here yesterday morning	Etsɔ ŋdi koe mekpɔ wò le afisia
I also used to enjoy this teacher	Nufiala sia hã do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ tsã
I think he felt it too	Mesusu be eya hã se le eɖokui me
Go home with him.	Yi aƒeme kplii.
And that’s a problem.	Eye esia nye kuxi.
No wonder he liked himself.	Mewɔ nuku o be eya ŋutɔ ƒe nu dze eŋu.
Please let me know what works best for you.	Taflatse na manya nusi awɔ dɔ nyuie na wò.
But I doubt it	Gake meke ɖi le eŋu
He didn’t do that.	Mewɔe nenema o.
I had to make two rooms	Ele be mawɔ xɔ eve
I was the last of it	Nyee nye eƒe mamlɛtɔ
Get out, go somewhere, but do it on foot.	Do go, yi afi aɖe, gake wɔe to afɔ.
He could not raise the money to do so	Mete ŋu dzɔ ga la wɔe nenema o
I have my own life to live.	Nye ŋutɔ nye agbe le asinye manɔ.
For having a well-ordered house.	Le ame ƒe aƒe si le ɖoɖo nyui nu ta.
So that we can live.	Ale be míate ŋu anɔ agbe.
Something we can just keep going.	Nane si míate ŋu ayi edzi ko.
I have to work.	Ele be mawɔ dɔ.
I can prove that to you in this book	Mate ŋu aɖo kpe esia dzi na wò le agbalẽ sia me
Get rid of everything.	Ðe nusianu ɖa.
Still, few thought it would actually work.	Ke hã, ame ʋɛ aɖewo koe susui be awɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But I had never heard of him	Gake nyemese eƒe ŋkɔ kpɔ o
He didn't seem to feel it.	Edze abe mese le eɖokui me o ene.
Come with us.	Va kpli mí.
I am one of these people	Ame siawo dometɔ ɖekae menye
That’s personal.	Ema nye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
A man simply cannot do anything	Ðeko ŋutsu mate ŋu awɔ naneke o
The whole thing just came together.	Ðeko nu bliboa ƒo ƒu ɖekae.
I remember that room well	Meɖo ŋku xɔ ma dzi nyuie
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I can spend time with them	Mate ŋu akpɔ ɣeyiɣi ɖe wo ŋu
I can't tell what kind	Nyemate ŋu anya ƒomevi si ƒomevi wònye o
There are several reasons why this might be the case.	Susu geɖe li siwo tae wòate ŋu adzɔ nenema ɖo.
This is not new to me.	Esia menye nu yeye nam o.
This new place is great.	Teƒe yeye sia nyo ŋutɔ.
But he didn’t have any.	Gake ɖeke menɔ esi o.
What a place this is!.	Nukae nye teƒe sia!.
Song.	Ha.
This can take years.	Esia ate ŋu axɔ ƒe geɖe.
Which goes to my point.	Nusi yi nye nya la gbɔ.
Or maybe it’s just my own voice.	Alo ɖewohĩ nye ŋutɔ nye gbe koe wònye.
I wondered if there was any food there	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖe nuɖuɖu aɖe le afima hã
But why should this be.	Gake nukatae wòle be esia nanɔ.
Maybe that will help you.	Ðewohĩ ema akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I don’t know anything about it.	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o.
I’m surprised it started at all, actually.	Ewɔ nuku nam be edze egɔme kura, le nyateƒe me.
In the same year.	Le ƒe ma ke me.
The time I had with me was huge.	Ɣeyiɣi si metsɔ ɖe asi la nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
No one can stay here for very long.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ afisia ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ o.
He did more for her than anyone else.	Ewɔ nu geɖe nɛ wu ame bubu ɖesiaɖe.
Something didn’t fit together.	Nane mewɔ ɖeka kple wo nɔewo o.
It seemed to be working.	Edze abe ɖe wònɔ dɔ wɔm ene.
I told him a lot too	Megblɔ nya geɖe nɛ hã
I can’t do anything about this	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke tso esia ŋu o
I was totally opposed to that.	Metsi tre ɖe ema ŋu tututu.
No one else can handle the job.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu akpɔ dɔa gbɔ o.
I didn’t expect people to be able to stay like that	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be amewo ate ŋu anɔ anyi nenema o
He definitely had his day for me.	Eƒe ŋkeke nɔ esi nam godoo.
I know what that is now	Menya nusi ema nye fifia
This is impossible to do.	Esia mate ŋu awɔ o.
That guy definitely existed.	Ŋutsu ma nɔ anyi kpɔ godoo.
Maybe that’s why.	Ðewohĩ ema tae.
I couldn’t talk about anything	Nyemete ŋu ƒo nu tso naneke ŋu o
There’s not much to work with.	Nu geɖe meli woawɔ dɔ kplii o.
Part of the work is already underway.	Dɔa ƒe akpa aɖe le edzi yim xoxo.

This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I have some work to do.	Dɔ aɖewo le asinye.
He has a point.	Nya aɖe le esi.

I’ve never seen anything like it	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o
A month ago, they were all fine	Ɣleti ɖeka enye sia la, wo katã wole nɔnɔme nyui me

I don’t really know anything about it	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ o
There was no issue between us.	Nya aɖeke menɔ mía dome o.
I hope this is a big mistake	Mele mɔ kpɔm be vodada gã aɖee nye esia
It didn’t do much work.	Mewɔ dɔ boo aɖeke o.
It certainly looks like one.	Edze abe ɖeka ene godoo.
It’s a book about nothing, really.	Enye agbalẽ si ku ɖe naneke ŋu o, le nyateƒe me.
I hope it stays the same	Mele mɔ kpɔm be anɔ anyi abe alesi wòle ene
I didn’t know you were there	Nyemenya be èle afima o
You just never know.	Ðeko mènya gbeɖe o.
He had been there, too.	Eya hã nɔ afima kpɔ.
There are many of us there	Mía dometɔ geɖe le afima
But it was very interesting.	Gake edzɔ dzi na ame ŋutɔ.
We have to work very hard now	Ele be míawɔ dɔ sesĩe ŋutɔ fifia
In fact, he did nothing of the kind.	Le nyateƒe me la, mewɔ naneke si ƒomevi wòwɔ o.
This is something new to me.	Esia nye nu yeye nam.
I can’t stand it anymore	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi azɔ o
I wonder if we could go out for a bit	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe míate ŋu ado go vie hã
I enjoyed playing the passive role	Akpa si mewɔa naneke o la wɔwɔ do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
I can’t do that right now	Nyemate ŋu awɔ ema fifia o
Be a good person, be happy.	Nye ame nyui, kpɔ dzidzɔ.
It can be useful in addition.	Ate ŋu aɖe vi kpe ɖe eŋu.
This is a good thing.	Esia nye nu nyui aɖe.
I can’t tell you what we’re doing here	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi wɔm míele le afisia na wò o
I had no one to talk to	Ame aɖeke menɔ asinye maƒo nu kplii o
That’s the only thing missing.	Ema koe nye nusi bu le eme.
I fell for that one, hard.	Medze anyi ɖe ɖeka ma ŋu, sesĩe.
I can’t get there on my own	Nyemate ŋu aɖo afima le ɖokuinye si o
But he couldn’t understand them.	Gake mete ŋu se wo gɔme o.
I understand this better now.	Mese esia gɔme nyuie wu fifia.
How does that sound?.	Aleke nya ma ɖi?.
This didn’t happen overnight.	Menye zã ɖeka me koe esia dzɔ o.
It never reached the market.	Meɖo asi me kpɔ o.
This is almost this.	Esia kloe nye esia.
I am doing really well with my diet	Mele nu wɔm nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ le nye nuɖuɖu me
Maybe explain everything to him.	Ðewohĩ aɖe nusianu me nɛ.
I know this won’t be easy.	Menya be esia manɔ bɔbɔe o.
We are going to need more people for this.	Míele ame geɖe wu hiã ge na esia.
I was very sick of that situation	Nɔnɔme ma dze dɔ nam ŋutɔ
I believe in them.	Mexɔ wo dzi se.
I am only going to say this once	Zi ɖeka koe mele nya sia gblɔ ge
It’s his head.	Eƒe tae.
I think there is only one.	Mesusu be ɖeka koe li.
That was my big lie.	Emae nye nye alakpa gã la.
It will definitely work.	Awɔ dɔ godoo.
I wasn’t happy with it.	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu o.
I felt the blood rush to my face	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ʋua nɔ du dzi va nye mo
I planted my leg and stood up	Medo nye afɔ eye metsi tre
I am still the same.	Megale nenema kokoko.
It's too personal.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa.
I am going to do everything right.	Mele nusianu wɔ ge nyuie.
My voice came out easy.	Nye gbe do go le bɔbɔe.
I am totally opposed to that	Metsi tre ɖe nya ma ŋu kura
A good fire sounded good	Dzo nyui aɖe ɖi nyuie
He didn’t throw anything away at all.	Metsɔ naneke ƒu gbe kura o.
This is no small feat.	Esia menye nu sue aɖeke o.
It will cost more in the long run.	Axɔ ga geɖe wu le ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe megbe.
I can’t place what it is	Nyemate ŋu aɖo nusi wònye la ɖe teƒe o
This stuff takes a long time.	Nu sia xɔa ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe.
The same thing happened the other night.	Nu ma ke dzɔ le zã bubu me.
However, untruth and lie are not necessarily the same thing.	Ke hã, menye nyateƒe o kple alakpa menye nu ɖeka kokoko o.
I could never be mad at you.	Nyemate ŋu ado dziku ɖe ŋuwò gbeɖe o.
I don’t want anything in return.	Nyemedi naneke ɖe eteƒe o.
I couldn’t do that once	Nyemete ŋu wɔ ema zi ɖeka o

It’s wrong, wrong.	Enye nu gbegblẽ, nu gbegblẽ.
There is nothing to do here.	Naneke meli woawɔ le afisia o.

I have a very different opinion about it.	Nye susu to vovo kura le eŋu.
I had to apologize to him	Ele nam be maɖe kuku nɛ

There was no gun inside.	Tu aɖeke menɔ eme o.
Because of that person.	Le ame ma ta.

No one should be treated that way.	Mele be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​ame aɖeke ŋu alea o.

I never wanted to let go	Nyemedi gbeɖe be maɖe asi le eŋu o
I looked around the house	Mekpɔ aƒea me
But somehow it doesn’t matter.	Gake le mɔ aɖe nu la, mehiã o.
We can beat anyone.	Míate ŋu aɖu amesiame dzi.
I said that’s good	Megblɔ be esia nyo
Like, talk to him talk to him.	Abe, ƒo nu kplii ƒo nu kplii ene.
Go to work, come back.	Yi dɔme, trɔ gbɔ.
What we are.	Nusi míenye.
I hope you all have a wonderful day today	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ŋkeke nyui aɖe na mi katã egbea
I can’t tell him that, of course	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma nɛ ya o
I’ve always been here	Meva afisia ɣesiaɣi
Once a week is fine.	Zi ɖeka le kwasiɖa me nyo.
Pretty much everything.	Nusianu kloe kloe.
It was a great opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖee wònye.
There is nothing personal between you and me.	Ame ŋutɔ ƒe naneke mele mía kpli wò dome o.
But the wind didn’t let him.	Gake ya meɖe mɔ nɛ o.
I hope there is a job for you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be dɔ aɖe anɔ anyi na wò.
They are in it for the wrong reason.	Susu gbegblẽ aɖe tae wole eme ɖo.
I know this isn’t easy for you either.	Menya be esia hã mele bɔbɔe na wò o.
I think that’s pretty good	Mesusu be nya ma nyo ŋutɔ
I can’t go home again	Nyemate ŋu ayi aƒeme ake o
He never did it.	Mewɔe kpɔ o.
But we need to keep two things in mind.	Gake ele be nu eve nanɔ susu me na mí.
I want to go places with him	Medi be mayi teƒe aɖewo kplii
I like a man who can work	Ŋutsu si te ŋu wɔa dɔ la dzɔa dzi nam
I am not wishing him death	Nyemele ku dim nɛ o
I think that’s everything, so far	Mesusu be emae nye nusianu, vaseɖe fifia
He was a strong man.	Ŋutsu sesẽ aɖee wònye.
This is a new idea.	Esia nye susu yeye aɖe.
I couldn’t think of it	Nyemete ŋu bu eŋu o
I understand it better now	Mese egɔme nyuie wu fifia
Who was that.	Amekae nɔ nenema.
Or if you’re working on it.	Alo ne èle dɔ wɔm ɖe eŋu.
I just can’t explain it	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖe eme o
This is in order.	Esia le ɖoɖo nu.
You don’t have to do this.	Mehiã be nàwɔ esia o.
But it doesn’t work.	Gake mewɔa dɔ o.
I really believe in this stuff	Mexɔ nu sia dzi se ŋutɔŋutɔ
I will only say what is important for now.	Nusi le vevie koe magblɔ fifia.
Thinking about someone other than yourself.	Ame bubu aɖe si menye wò ŋutɔ wò o ŋu bubu.
I might have four.	Ðewohĩ ene anɔ asinye.
But I’m surprised you’d have one in your home.	Gake ewɔ nuku nam be ɖeka anɔ asiwò le wò aƒeme.
I have never seen anything more beautiful	Nyemekpɔ naneke si nya kpɔ wu esia kpɔ o
I was just going through it.	Ðeko menɔ eme tom.
I had fun last night	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ le zã si va yi me
I took a step forward myself	Nye ŋutɔ meɖe afɔ ɖeka yi ŋgɔ
I know everyone.	Menya amesiame.
This is a very strange thing.	Esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I am trying so hard.	Mele agbagba dzem vevie ale gbegbe.
But maybe.	Gake ɖewohĩ.
He couldn't say anything to her.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nya aɖeke nɛ o.
This in itself is wrong.	Esia le eɖokui si nye nu gbegblẽ.
I am but a voice tonight	Gbe aɖe koe menye le zã sia me
I saw a pig come back	Mekpɔ ha aɖe si trɔ gbɔ
But for him.	Gake na eya.
It worked out very well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
We don’t know what your name is yet.	Míenya ŋkɔ si nènye haɖe o.
I only know what is in my own heart.	Nusi le nye ŋutɔ nye dzi me koe menya.
But it wasn’t too late.	Gake metsi megbe akpa o.
I needed that time to work on it	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi ma be mawɔ dɔ tso eŋu
People rushed inside.	Amewo ƒu du ge ɖe eme.
He will probably be there.	Anye be anɔ afima.
I had no skills	Aɖaŋu aɖeke menɔ asinye o
But, of course, it wouldn’t be the case if he could.	Gake, le nyateƒe me la, manɔ nenema ne ɖe wòate ŋui o.
People are angry.	Amewo do dziku.
I just couldn’t do it.	Ðeko nyemete ŋui o.
I just fell down.	Ðeko medze anyi.
I decided to keep doing the same thing	Meɖoe be mayi edzi anɔ nu ma ke wɔm
I don’t feel satisfied with this right now	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be esia ƒe dzi dze eme fifia o
He would try anything.	Ate nusianu kpɔ.
For the great day.	Le ŋkeke gã la ta.
Already, very possibly.	Xoxo, ate ŋu anye ŋutɔ.
Things are fast.	Nuwo le kaba.
I don’t want to go anywhere with him	Nyemedi be mayi afi aɖeke kplii o
I finally made an appointment	Meva ɖo ɣeyiɣi aɖe ɖi mlɔeba
That made no sense to me.	Susu aɖeke menɔ nya ma ŋu nam o.
In this case, you’re ready to go.	Le go sia me la, èle klalo be yeayi.
I heard good news about you.	Mese nya nyui aɖe tso ŋuwò.
I want to see everything	Medi be makpɔ nusianu
Which is very appropriate.	Nusi sɔ ŋutɔ.
I said this would be good.	Megblɔ be esia anyo.
Please suggest something else.	Taflatse do susu bubu aɖe ɖa.
I liked him that way	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam nenema
Nor any one person.	Alo ame ɖeka aɖeke hã o.
Just you and me this time.	Mía kple wò koe zi sia.
I honestly can’t understand how these two can be together	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemate ŋu ase alesi ame eve siawo ate ŋu anɔ ɖekae gɔme o
That’s totally right.	Ema sɔ kura.
Another dead end.	Mɔ kuku bubu aɖe hã.
I have time to do it	Ɣeyiɣi le asinye mawɔe
I will continue to come here again and again	Mayi edzi ava afisia zi gbɔ zi geɖe
I didn’t see or hear anything to help.	Nyemekpɔ naneke alo se naneke si akpe ɖe eŋu o.
I have already told you this	Megblɔ nya sia na mi xoxo
You can never do enough.	Màte ŋu awɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ gbeɖe o.
But getting there.	Gake afima ɖoɖo.
I was alone for a long time before that	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe do ŋgɔ na ema
The house is all they have.	Aƒea koe nye nusi le wo si.
Loud and clear.	Sesẽ eye eme kɔ nyuie.
I took some time, yesterday	Mexɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe, etsɔ
He can talk to you.	Ate ŋu aƒo nu kpli wò.
It didn’t surprise me at all.	Mewɔ nuku nam kura o.
Everything has changed.	Nusianu trɔ.
This is too good to be true.	Esia nyo akpa.
I have a great place in mind	Meɖo teƒe gã aɖe le susu me
There is really very little we can say about this here.	Nu sue aɖe koe míate ŋu agblɔ tso esia ŋu le afisia ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I still can’t believe he’s actually here	Nyemeka ɖe edzi kokoko be ele afisia ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I don’t know who you are	Nyemenya ame si nènye o
It’s very, very important.	Ele vevie ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
He did the same thing.	Ewɔ nu ma ke.
A man opposite caught her eye	Ŋutsu aɖe si tsi tre ɖe eŋu la lé eƒe ŋku
I want everything else.	Medi nu bubu ɖesiaɖe.
There may not be much or there may be more.	Ðewohĩ nu geɖe manɔ anyi o alo nu geɖe ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
Independent.	Le eɖokui si.
I can talk about that now.	Mate ŋu aƒo nu tso ema ŋu fifia.
And it’s amazing.	Eye wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I want to work on it	Medi be mawɔ dɔ tso eŋu
But not more than enough.	Gake menye nusi wu esi sɔ gbɔ o.
But everyone else understood.	Gake ame bubu ɖesiaɖe se egɔme.
This happened to quite a lot of them, actually.	Esia dzɔ ɖe wo dometɔ geɖe ŋutɔ dzi, le nyateƒe me.
Life doesn’t work like that.	Agbe mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
I had to spit it out	Ele nam be maɖe ta ɖe eŋu
I hope you can do that	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu awɔe nenema
But I wanted to do more	Gake medi be mawɔ geɖe wu
I couldn’t hold his hand	Nyemete ŋu lé eƒe asi o
I didn’t know this existed	Nyemenya be esia li o
It’s just a matter of time and time again.	Ɣeyiɣi kple ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.
I don’t want to go in there.	Nyemedi be mayi ɖe afima o.
I was actually looking forward to it	Le nyateƒe me la, menɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie
That’s a good thing.	Nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
My job is done.	Nye dɔa wu enu.
And the year.	Eye ƒe.
But that’s not why.	Gake menye esia tae o.
Maybe I could have done better	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu hafi
I had no idea he was here	Nyemenya kura be ele afisia o
Maybe I’ll do it somewhere else	Ðewohĩ mawɔe le teƒe bubu
I couldn’t get my head around it	Nyemete ŋu tsi ta le ta o
Too close, actually.	Te ɖe eŋu akpa, le nyateƒe me.
We should try that too.	Ele be míate ema hã kpɔ.
I don’t want to know any of them	Nyemedi be manya wo dometɔ aɖeke o
I need to know what happened	Ele be manya nusi dzɔ
This is enough.	Esia sɔ gbɔ.
It’s been a long day.	Ewɔ ŋkeke didi aɖe.
This piece is really beautiful!.	Akpa sia nya kpɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ!.
I was right behind him	Menɔ megbe nɛ tututu
You don’t know what that looks like.	Mènya alesi ema le o.
I just think you can	Ðeko mesusu be àte ŋui
In this case, it actually worked for him.	Le go sia me la, ewɔ dɔ nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t know who you are	Nyemenya ame si nènye o
I’ve never seen them here before	Nyemekpɔ wo le afisia kpɔ o
I didn’t expect it to be like this	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be anɔ alea o
I can’t emphasize it better	Nyemate ŋu ate gbe ɖe edzi nyuie wu o
I didn’t expect anyone else to help me	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be ame bubu aɖeke akpe ɖe ŋunye o
There are two parts to it.	Akpa eve ye le eme.
I know they didn’t mind	Menya be meɖe fu na wo o
I wanted to be there	Medi be manɔ afima
He did that very well.	Ewɔ ema nyuie ŋutɔ.
I don't want to know.	Madi be manya.
He was fascinated by her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
I made them.	Nyee wɔ wo.
I’m not sure how long it will last.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi be ɣeyiɣi didi kae wòawɔ o.
This was difficult for me.	Esia sesẽ nam.
I am anything but that	Nyee nye nusianu tsɔ wu ema
He couldn't have believed much else.	Mate ŋu axɔ nu bubu geɖe dzi ase hafi o.
You know what you are.	Ènya nusi nènye.
I discovered four things today	Meke ɖe nu ene ŋu egbea
I was hoping he would talk to you about it	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be aƒo nu tso eŋu na wò
I was able to slip forward easily	Mete ŋu ƒu du yi ŋgɔ bɔbɔe
It’s been a tough week.	Kwasiɖa sesẽ aɖee wònye.
Whether any of it is true, he doesn’t know.	Nenye be wo dometɔ aɖe nye nyateƒe la, menya o.
A few times a week.	Zi ʋɛ aɖewo le kwasiɖa me.
I knew what he wanted	Menya nusi dim wònɔ
That it is real.	Be enye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I like buying things for you	Nuwo ƒle na wò dzɔa dzi nam
He can still do something.	Ate ŋu awɔ nane kokoko.
I couldn’t imagine what he would do	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi wòawɔ le susu me o
Or from his predecessor.	Alo tso amesi do ŋgɔ nɛ gbɔ.
It was a little different this time.	Enye nusi to vovo vie zi sia.
I rejected that idea.	Megbe susu ma.
We can’t be here without help.	Míate ŋu anɔ afisia kpekpeɖeŋu manɔmee o.
It happened hours later.	Edzɔ le gaƒoƒo geɖe megbe.
I wasn’t trying to do that	Menye ɖe menɔ agbagba dzem be mawɔe nenema o
I liked his idea	Eƒe susu lé dzi nam
I will do two jobs for one of hers.	Mawɔ dɔ eve na eƒe ɖeka.
Everyone else was working.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe nɔ dɔ wɔm.
There is certainly reason for that.	Ema ƒe susu li godoo.
I just want to apologize	Ðeko medi be maɖe kuku
Right on the money.	Le ga la dzi tututu.
I can’t say it’s true	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ be enye nyateƒe o
We can handle that.	Míate ŋu akpɔ ema gbɔ.
But there are some downsides.	Gake nu gbegblẽ aɖewo le eŋu.
He was not one of them.	Menye wo dometɔ ɖekae wònye o.
Actually, that’s what it’s for.	Le nyateƒe me la, ema tae wòle.
I recognize your voice	Mekpɔ wò gbe dze sii
This could be very good for him.	Esia ate ŋu anyo nɛ ŋutɔ.
Your face	Wò mo .
This will work.	Esia awɔ dɔ.
I tried hard, for a long time	Medze agbagba vevie, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔ
He obviously didn’t understand the real predicament.	Edze ƒã be mese kuxi sesẽ si me wòle ŋutɔŋutɔ gɔme o.
It’s not a small thing at all.	Menye nu sue aɖeke kura o.
I didn’t mean to say that.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be magblɔ nya ma o.
I want to address this	Medi be makpɔ esia gbɔ
Some things appeared more than once.	Nu aɖewo do wu zi ɖeka.
He probably would have run away.	Anɔ eme be si dzo hafi.
Please do the same.	Taflatse wɔe nenema ke.
I wondered which one made my sword	Mebia ɖokuinye be wo dometɔ kae wɔ nye yi hã
See and.	Kpɔ kple.
I can’t understand it	Nyemate ŋu ase egɔme o
I could never ask you	Nyemete ŋu bia wò kpɔ o
I certainly would have seen them	Anye ne mekpɔ wo godoo hafi
Some shorts are very happy.	Kpuie aɖewo kpɔa dzidzɔ ŋutɔ.
I didn’t expect to see anything	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be makpɔ naneke o
And the result is fascinating.	Eye nusi do tso eme la doa dzidzɔ na mí ŋutɔ.
I got there too late	Metsi megbe akpa le afima ɖoɖo me
I knew that could never happen	Menya be ema mate ŋu adzɔ gbeɖe o
They had so much more.	Nu geɖe wu nɔ wo si.
This is something completely new to me.	Esia nye nu yeye kura nam.
I didn’t have time to do anything.	Ɣeyiɣi menɔ asinye mawɔ naneke o.
But that’s not working right now.	Gake ema mele dɔ wɔm fifia o.
It’s not at all surprising.	Mewɔ nuku kura o.
It’s been good to me.	Ewɔ nyui nam.
I’ve seen you.	Mekpɔ wò.
It was a surprise to us.	Ewɔ nuku na mí.
I just, its not there, for me	Nye ɖeka, eƒe menye afima o, nam
I apologize for that.	Meɖe kuku le nya ma ta.
You have no legs.	Afɔ aɖeke mele asiwò o.
It seems easier than that.	Edze abe ele bɔbɔe wu nenema ene.
No one can take that away from him.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu axɔ ema le esi o.
I think maybe the alcohol is doing its job	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ aha la le eƒe dɔ wɔm
I want this as much as you do	Nye hã medi esia abe wò ke ene
I am very new to this please bear with me	Nyee nye ame yeye ŋutɔ na esia taflatse do dzi nam
As long as.	Zi ale si.
The work is beautiful.	Dɔa nya kpɔ ŋutɔ.
I need to draw more.	Ele be maɖe nu geɖe wu.
I am doing this, obviously.	Mele esia wɔm, edze ƒã.
In fact, this is not true.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia menye nyateƒe o.
Here is your opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ na wòe nye esi.
His mouth was watered.	Eƒe nu te tsi.
Step with your opposite leg.	Tsɔ wò afɔ si tsi tre ɖe eŋu la ɖe afɔ.
They all seem to be running fine.	Edze abe wo katã wole du dzi nyuie ene.
I hope he feels the same way	Mele mɔ kpɔm be eya hã ase le eɖokui me nenema ke
I couldn’t lie to him.	Nyemete ŋu da alakpa nɛ o.
Not on alcohol, anyway.	Menye le aha sesẽ dzi o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
So would anyone else.	Nenema ke ame bubu ɖesiaɖe hã awɔe.
I have a way out of this	Mɔ aɖe le asinye ado le esia me
I just know who.	Ðeko menya amesi.
They are offering what seems like a great opportunity	Wole nusi dze abe mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe ene nam
He is not like you.	Mele abe wò ene o.
Which one is better in this regard.	Wo dometɔ kae nyo wu le go sia me.
I want to see you all	Medi be makpɔ mi katã
For many hours.	Gaƒoƒo geɖe.
I was worried if something would happen to him.	Metsi dzi ne nane adzɔ ɖe edzi.
I’m not expecting anything.	Nyemele mɔ kpɔm na naneke o.
That’s what’s interesting.	Emae nye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame.
Everyone is going to hate me.	Ame sia ame le fu lé ge nam.
This could be the location of the room.	Esia ate ŋu anye teƒe si xɔa le.
I explained the situation	Meɖe alesi nuwo nɔ la me na mi
I put my ear to it, but could hear nothing	Metsɔ nye to ɖo eŋu, gake nyemete ŋu se naneke o
Still, it was amazing.	Ke hã, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
For the sake of something better.	Le nusi nyo wu ta.
I said many thanks	Megblɔ be akpe geɖe
He gave me a gun.	Etsɔ tu nam.
Nothing good will come of it.	Nu nyui aɖeke mado tso eme o.
I was so angry with them	Medo dziku ɖe wo ŋu ale gbegbe
I didn’t have that either	Ema hã menɔ asinye o
I am the person you want	Nyee nye ame si nèdi
I shouldn’t have done that.	Mele be mawɔ nu ma hafi o.
I have to marry you	Ele nam be maɖe wò
Which is a bit of a good thing.	Nusi nye nu nyui aɖe vie.
Shoot shot after shot.	Da tu ɖe tu ɖeka megbe.
A house under a house	Aƒe aɖe si le aƒe aɖe te
But he didn’t care.	Gake metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
I was completely nervous	Metsi dzodzodzoe kura
Just a little bit.	Susu aɖe ko.
I tried, but to no avail	Medze agbagba, gake medze edzi o
If anything, get suspicious quickly.	Ne nane li la, ke ɖi kaba.
It’s a real waste of money.	Enye ga gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He never did that before.	Mewɔe nenema kpɔ o.
I glanced around but he was alone	Meɖe ŋku ɖe nu ŋu gake eya ɖeka koe nɔ anyi
He couldn’t see anyone anywhere.	Mete ŋu kpɔ ame aɖeke le afi aɖeke o.
I wasn’t supposed to be anywhere else	Menye ɖe wòle be manɔ teƒe bubu aɖeke o
Open some songs.	Ʋu ha aɖewo.
Eventually, he lost his mind as a result.	Mlɔeba la, eƒe susu bu le esia ta.
But I was expecting that.	Gake menɔ mɔ kpɔm na ema.
There wasn’t really any money.	Ga aɖeke menɔ anyi ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
He would have had plenty of reason to do so.	Anye ne susu geɖe anɔ esi wòawɔ nenema hafi.
But there seems to be no rules.	Gake edze abe se aɖeke meli o ene.
It’s a long way though.	Mɔ didi aɖee nye ema ke hã.
Many of us are in the same way.	Mía dometɔ geɖe hã le mɔ ma ke nu.
He is alone on the dirt road.	Eya ɖeka koe le mɔ si dzi ke le la dzi.
That was one of the reasons for her fascination.	Emae nye susu siwo tae eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ɖo la dometɔ ɖeka.
I still don’t understand it.	Nyemese egɔme haɖe o.
With anger and rage.	Kple dziku kple dziku.
He couldn’t do any work.	Mete ŋu nɔ dɔ aɖeke wɔm o.
I couldn’t get enough	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nusi sɔ gbɔ o
I am a single man, leading a very busy life	Nyee nye ŋutsu ɖeka, si nɔa agbe si me vovo mele o ŋutɔ
He was just one man.	Ŋutsu ɖeka koe wònye.
It’s just you.	Wò koe nènye.
A mistake, just a little one	Vodada aɖe, sue aɖe ko
It just never occurred to me.	Ðeko meva susu me nam gbeɖe o.
Seems like a long time ago now.	Edze abe ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia fifia ene.
I quickly approached him	Mete ɖe eŋu kaba
It couldn’t have been any other way.	Mate ŋu anye mɔ bubu aɖeke hafi o.
I wasn’t attracted to him	Menye eƒe nu lé dzi nam o
It was a great opportunity for him.	Enye mɔnukpɔkpɔ gã aɖe nɛ.
Now he will do it.	Fifia awɔe.
I didn’t see them take anything	Nyemekpɔ wo tsɔ naneke o
That’s the first thing.	Emae nye nu gbãtɔ.
Kind of like herself.	Ƒomevi aɖe abe eya ŋutɔ ene.
I will beat them all	Maƒo wo katã
I’m excited about it.	Edzɔ dzi nam.

These things will likely help you do that.	Anɔ eme be nu siawo akpe ɖe ŋuwò nàwɔ ema.

It will be like any other currency.	Anɔ abe ga bubu aɖe ene.
I had only one clear idea	Susu ɖeka si me kɔ koe nɔ asinye
I quickly found it	Meva ke ɖe eŋu kaba
He would fight it yet, in this one small way.	Awɔ avu kplii haɖe, le mɔ sue ɖeka sia nu.
Just like the past two weeks.	Abe alesi wònɔ le kwasiɖa eve siwo va yi me ene.
Give him some food and water.	Na nuɖuɖu kple tsi vi aɖee.
Often, there is little we can do.	Zi geɖe la, nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe li si míate ŋu awɔ.
We never had any problems with him.	Kuxi aɖeke menɔ mía kplii ŋu kpɔ o.
It seems like a minor issue.	Edze abe nya sue aɖee wònye ene.

I just want to get on with my life.	Ðeko medi be mayi nye agbe dzi.
I couldn’t get back in the house, not yet	Nyemete ŋu trɔ yi aƒea me o, menye haɖe o
I didn’t have to look for any of them this morning	Mehiã be madi wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋdi sia o
I didn’t want to make the drive home	Nyemedi be mawɔ ʋua ayi aƒeme o
That means everything.	Ema fia nusianu.

He needed to stay focused.	Ehiã be eƒe susu nanɔ nu ŋu.
I made that promise	Medo ŋugbe ma
I don’t really want anything	Nyemedi naneke ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I can’t answer it.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo eŋu o.
And many of them are.	Eye wo dometɔ geɖe hã le nenema.
And it’s here to stay.	Eye wòle afisia be yeanɔ anyi.
His hand came up to protect his face.	Eƒe asi va do be yeakpɔ eƒe mo ta.
The right moment in time.	Ɣeyiɣi si sɔ le ɣeyiɣi me.
An old house, which continued to thrive.	Aƒe xoxo aɖe, si yi edzi nɔ ŋgɔ yim.
Finish the project.	Wu dɔa nu.
I neck him a little.	Mewɔa kɔ nɛ vie.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe eya ene kpɔ o.
I took a quick step	Meɖe afɔ kaba
He was also passionate.	Dzo nɔ eŋu hã.
I could do this all day like it was nothing	Mate ŋu awɔ esia ŋkeke bliboa abe ɖe menye naneke o ene
People have different opinions.	Amewo ƒe susu to vovo.
That’s the name of it.	Emae nye eƒe ŋkɔ.

I’ve seen what happened	Mekpɔ nu si dzɔ la ɖa

The first time was because he had a problem with his car.	Zi gbãtɔ la, esi kuxi aɖe nɔ eŋu le eƒe ʋua ŋu tae.

Please let me know and thank you in advance!!!!.	Taflatse na manya eye akpe na mi do ŋgɔ!!!!.
This is true, if not exactly true, nonetheless.	Esia nye nyateƒe, ne menye nyateƒe tututu o la, ke hã.

I wore a completely different outfit than him	Medo awu si to vovo kura tso eya gbɔ

He wasn’t the only one.	Menye eya ɖeka koe o.
That was a great day.	Ema nye ŋkeke gã aɖe ŋutɔ.

He didn’t get any.	Mexɔ ɖeke o.

I can’t feel anything	Nyemate ŋu ase naneke le ɖokuinye me o
On his face.	Le eƒe mo.
However, there are several very obvious difficulties.	Gake kuxi sesẽ geɖe siwo dze ƒã ŋutɔ li.
You may need to do this several times.	Ðewohĩ ahiã be nàwɔ esia zi geɖe.
You just don’t know anything.	Ðeko mènya naneke o.

Something big was coming.	Nu gã aɖe nɔ ŋgɔ gbɔna.

I couldn’t stand him or him	Nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu alo eya ŋutɔ o
I was very close to him.	Mete ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ.
I couldn’t find his car	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe eƒe ʋua ŋu o
There was still time.	Ɣeyiɣi gakpɔtɔ nɔ anyi.

Maybe it will work well.	Ðewohĩ awɔ dɔ nyuie.

For some reason, they had no children.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, vi aɖeke menɔ wo si o.

Everyone did their job well.	Amesiame wɔ eƒe dɔ nyuie.
But there is nothing to be done about it.	Gake naneke meli woawɔ tso eŋu o.

Nothing surprised him.	Naneke mewɔ nuku nɛ o.

This is usually not a problem.	Zi geɖe la, esia menye kuxi aɖeke o.

Maybe not anymore, not like before.	Ðewohĩ megale nenema o, menye abe tsã ene o.

I was hoping he was at his word	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be enye ame si le eƒe nya nu
It is the wrong thing to do.	Enye nu gbegblẽ si woawɔ.
A voice answered him as he spoke	Gbe aɖe ɖo eŋu nɛ esi wònɔ nu ƒom
Years have passed.	Ƒe geɖe va yi.
And it makes sense.	Eye susu le eme.
I definitely got that much out of it	Mexɔ nu geɖe tso eme nenema godoo
That was amazing.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
Nothing is against it.	Naneke metsi tre ɖe eŋu o.

But trust me, though.	Gake ka ɖe dzinye.

There’s something that’s not quite there.	Nane li si mele afima tututu o.
I never had a problem with it	Nyemekpɔ kuxi aɖeke le eŋu kpɔ o
I can’t go on without him	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi eya manɔmee o
And something passed between them in that moment.	Eye nane to wo dome le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
I knew exactly what was going on	Menya nusi tututu nɔ edzi yim
I had been waiting.	Menɔ lalam tsã.
Anyone can see into it.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu akpɔ nu le eme.

Like something that makes sense.	Abe nane si me susu le ene.
If that happens, it may take some time.	Ne edzɔ alea la, ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
He was really interested.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And that’s important.	Eye ema le vevie.
I got to fire one of them once	Mekpɔ mɔ aɖe wo dometɔ ɖeka le dɔ me zi ɖeka
In fact, I was actually watching one	Le nyateƒe me la, menɔ ɖeka ŋutɔŋutɔ kpɔm
This really, really works.	Esia wɔa dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ, ŋutɔŋutɔ.

It’s just something for you.	Nu aɖe koe wònye na wò.

He will listen.	Aɖo to.
No one could reach their destination.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu ɖo afi si yim wole o.

But look at it.	Gake kpɔ ɖa.
But the police don't seem to be trying anymore.	Gake edze abe kpovitɔwo megale agbagba dzem o ene.

I remembered everything about the night before	Meɖo ŋku nusianu si ku ɖe zã si do ŋgɔ ŋu dzi
There will be nothing more.	Naneke manɔ anyi wu esia o.
Everyone ran out of school.	Amesiame ƒu du do le suku.

Maybe I missed something.	Ðewohĩ nane to ŋunye.
There shouldn’t be that many people busy.	Mele be ame geɖe nanɔ dɔ dzi nenema gbegbe o.

And take an interest in it.	Eye tsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ.

Each of these statements is false.	Nya siawo dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe nye alakpa.

And each of them is doing a good job.	Eye wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe le dɔ nyui aɖe wɔm.

That makes so much sense to me.	Susu le nya ma me nam ale gbegbe.

However, my comment about it is valid.	Ke hã, nye nya si megblɔ tso eŋu la sɔ.

I knew what that meant and I didn’t at all	Menya nusi ema fia eye nyemenya kura hã o
The truth is quite different.	Nyateƒea to vovo kura.
There is also something of a paradox.	Nane si tsi tre ɖe wo nɔewo ŋu hã li.
But it is something more than that.	Gake enye nusi de ŋgɔ wu ema.
Many were also unhappy with his work.	Ame geɖe hã mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eƒe dɔa ŋu o.

I have it in him.	Nyee le esi.
You know he didn’t have a good life before.	Ènya be menɔ agbe nyui tsã o.
But he couldn’t speak.	Gake mete ŋu ƒo nu o.
My voice was too small to reach out or travel anywhere.	Nye gbe nɔ sue akpa be mate ŋu ado asi alo azɔ mɔ ayi afi aɖeke o.
I just want surgery	Ðeko medi be woawɔ dɔ nam
He is on his way now.	Ele mɔ dzi fifia.
There is no reason for it.	Susu aɖeke mele eŋu o.
I was sick of it all week.	Medze dɔ le eŋu kwasiɖa bliboa katã.
I should have called	Ðe wòle be maƒo ka hafi
It would be really nice.	Anyo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
The one who didn’t let go.	Ame si meɖe asi le eŋu o.
I know what this is about	Menya nusi ŋu esia ku ɖo
This will take the job.	Esia axɔ dɔa.
I don’t know what else to do with them.	Nyemenya nu bubu si mawɔ ɖe wo ŋu o.
I need more and more.	Mehiã geɖe wu.
I needed that help	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu ma
I think it looks great.	Mesusu be edze nyuie ŋutɔ.
He couldn’t bear it.	Mete ŋu do dzi o.
I’m not there yet.	Nyemele afima haɖe o.
I want everything to be like that.	Medi be nusianu nanɔ nenema.
That takes a certain type of man.	Ema bia ŋutsu ƒomevi aɖe.
Thank you, maybe.	Akpe na wò, ɖewohĩ.
But I could never get my head around that	Gake nyemete ŋu ƒo ta ɖe nya ma ŋu gbeɖe o
And he had his stuff.	Eye eƒe nuwo nɔ esi.
This wasn’t the case.	Esia menɔ nenema o.
A long time ago and now.	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia kple fifia hã.
But I felt very depressed	Gake nye ya mese le ɖokuinye me be nu te ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
Or a few days.	Alo ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo.
But I’m not going to let it	Gake nyemele mɔ ɖe ge be mawɔe o
You told me a lot last night.	Ègblɔ nya geɖe nam le zã si va yi me.
Why? 	Nu ka ta?
And maybe you are, too.	Eye ɖewohĩ wò hã nèle nenema.
It wasn’t like here before.	Menɔ abe afisia ene tsã o.
I know where he is	Menya afisi wòle
I really wanted to spend time with him	Medi vevie be makpɔ ɣeyiɣi ɖe eŋu
I want to know more	Medi be manya nu geɖe wu
Easy, but not easy.	Ele bɔbɔe, gake mele bɔbɔe o.
It could have been any kind.	Ate ŋu anye ƒomevi ɖesiaɖe hafi.
I was a little worried	Metsi dzi vie
I did the same with him	Mewɔe nenema ɖe eya hã ŋu
I want everyone to have a job.	Medi be dɔ nanɔ amesiame si.
I was too interested in him	Metsɔ ɖe le eme nɛ akpa
I'm still kind of angry	Megale dziku dom le mɔ aɖe nu kokoko
Maybe just now.	Ðewohĩ fifia koe.
I wasn’t close enough to one to be beautiful	Nyemete ɖe ɖeka ŋu ale gbegbe be manya kpɔ o
But it didn’t happen that way.	Gake meva eme nenema o.
But somehow he couldn’t.	Gake le mɔ aɖe nu la, mete ŋui o.
It can make time.	Ate ŋu awɔ ɣeyiɣi.
I never had any reason to	Susu aɖeke menɔ asinye kpɔ be mawɔe o
I have so many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye le esia ŋu.
I’m glad for that	Edzɔ dzi nam le ema ta
Only one man ever appeared.	Ŋutsu ɖeka koe do mo ɖa kpɔ.
He didn't know how long he could control himself.	Menya ɣeyiɣi didi si wòate ŋu aɖu eɖokui dzi o.
I was able to do that	Mete ŋu wɔe nenema
That works well.	Ema wɔa dɔ nyuie.
He's not ready to see you yet.	Mele klalo be yeakpɔ wò haɖe o.
I thought he was a good guy	Mesusu be enye ŋutsu nyui aɖe
I wanted to say something to him.	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖe nɛ.
I’m never going to talk like that.	Nyemele nu ƒo ge nenema gbeɖe o.
You have lost a lot.	Nu geɖe bu na wò.
He saw no return fire.	Mekpɔ dzo aɖeke si trɔ gbɔ o.
No one knows his real name or past.	Ame aɖeke menya eƒe ŋkɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ alo agbe si wònɔ va yi o.
I just wanted to get out of there	Ðeko medi be mado le afima
We can see so much	Míate ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe ŋutɔ
That book is true.	Agbalẽ ma nye nyateƒe.
I almost liked her a lot	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ kloe
Think of something.	Bu nane ŋu kpɔ.
I tried, I tried really hard	Medze agbagba, medze agbagba vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ
He didn't feel bad about that.	Mese le eɖokui me be nu ma gblẽ le eŋu o.
But I can’t be mad at him	Gake nyemate ŋu ado dziku ɖe eŋu o
Without it, there would be no life.	Eya manɔmee la, agbe manɔ anyi o.
I couldn’t get that out of my mind.	Nyemete ŋu ɖe nya ma ɖa le nye susu me o.
He is a man of action.	Enye ame si wɔa nu.
But you can do that from back there, too.	Gake àte ŋu awɔ ema tso megbe afima, hã.
It all remained the same.	Wo katã gakpɔtɔ nɔ abe alesi wònɔ ene.
Everything, something different.	Nusianu, nane si to vovo.
I'll call you in an hour.	Maƒo ka na wò le gaƒoƒo ɖeka megbe.
I came to see you today	Meva kpɔ wò egbea
Everything is going well now.	Nusianu le edzi yim nyuie fifia.
I was hoping to talk to him earlier	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be maƒo nu kplii do ŋgɔ
I hear what you have to say	Mese nya si le asiwò be nàgblɔ
Not quite there yet.	Menye afima tututu haɖe o.
This is neither good nor bad.	Esia menye nu nyui alo nu gbegblẽ o.
This is going very well.	Esia le edzi yim nyuie ŋutɔ.
I know everything, everyone, everything is right.	Menya nusianu, amesiame, nusianu le eteƒe.
I put myself in it.	Metsɔ ɖokuinye de eme.
I can’t believe this either	Nye hã nyemate ŋu axɔ esia dzi ase o
Great job for people!.	Dɔ gã aɖe na amewo!.
Not that I shouldn’t tell you any of this	Menye ɖe mele be magblɔ nya siawo dometɔ aɖeke na wò o
I want to see who is faster	Medi be makpɔ amesi le du dzi wu
I was surprised and impressed	Ewɔ nuku nam eye wòwɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
In that way, he was like me.	Le mɔ ma nu la, eya hã nɔ abe nye ene.
There was blood on it, but only a little.	Ʋu nɔ edzi, gake vi aɖe koe nɔ edzi.
You’re attracted to him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi na wò.
Get in there.	Ge ɖe afima.
And so is he, too.	Eye eya hã le nenema ke.
I always kind of just act all the time	Mewɔa nu ko ƒomevi ɣesiaɣi ɣesiaɣi
Some people will never do it.	Ame aɖewo mawɔe gbeɖe o.
It's too personal.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ akpa.
A very small thing.	Nu sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
Conveniently located and realistic.	Teƒe sɔ nyuie eye wònye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I didn’t feel like talking	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me be maƒo nu o
A great day is ahead.	Ŋkeke gã aɖe le ŋgɔ gbɔna.
I know you are very, very busy	Menya be vovo mele ŋuwò vevie ŋutɔ
None of them came up.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meva do o.
I’ve already ordered another one	Mebia bubu xoxo
He can’t do any other way.	Mate ŋu awɔ nu le mɔ bubu aɖeke nu o.
Not sure if this is true.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be nya sia nye nyateƒe o.
I remembered that.	Meɖo ŋku nya ma dzi.
I looked into his room	Mekpɔ eƒe xɔ me
I could feel that we were here	Mete ŋu se le ɖokuinye me be míele afisia
But I do have a point	Gake nya aɖe le ŋunye ya
I don’t know what’s wrong with my voice	Nyemenya nusi gblẽ le nye gbe ŋu o
I want to work on myself	Medi be mawɔ dɔ tso ɖokuinye ŋu
We would be more than happy to work with you!.	Adzɔ dzi na mí wu be míawɔ dɔ kpli wò!.
I need surgery.	Mehiã be woawɔ dɔ nam.
I personally don’t want to be here	Nye ŋutɔ nyemedi be manɔ afisia o
I hope he doesn’t either	Mele mɔ kpɔm be eya hã mewɔe nenema o
I was so angry with them	Medo dziku ɖe wo ŋu ale gbegbe
But last night.	Gake etsɔ zã me.
I am that guy.	Nyee nye ŋutsu ma.
I don't understand.	Nyemese egɔme o.
I know what this means for the dog	Menya nusi esia fia na avu la
He has a room.	Xɔ aɖe le esi.
I was a little tired	Mete ɖeɖi ŋunye vie
Not everyone can say the same thing.	Menye ame sia ame ate ŋu agblɔ nya ɖeka o.
Here, now, in this moment.	Afisia, fifia, le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
Only two know at this point.	Eve koe nya le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
I had a lot on my mind.	Nu geɖe nɔ susu me nam.
I used to work for one	Mewɔa dɔ na ɖeka tsã
I told him this was out of the question	Megblɔ nɛ be nya sia megale eme o
There is a time and a place for everything.	Ɣeyiɣi kple teƒe li na nusianu.
I was very concerned about that.	Metsi dzi ɖe nya ma ŋu ŋutɔ.
I really hope a few people got away	Mele mɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ be ame ʋɛ aɖewo si dzo
I just think he’s very focused	Ðeko mesusu be eƒe susu le nu ŋu ŋutɔ
I had lived a great life	Menɔ agbe gã aɖe kpɔ
But he wouldn’t want that.	Gake madi nenema o.
I’m so glad they’re working really hard.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be wole dɔ wɔm sesĩe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I was actually there	Menɔ afima ŋutɔŋutɔ
I was not happy at home, when he was there	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ le aƒeme o, esime wònɔ afima
I tried to be positive about this	Medze agbagba be mawɔ nu nyuie le esia ŋu
I tried to keep my voice normal	Medze agbagba be nye gbe nanɔ abe ale si wòle ene
In the end, he did something good.	Mlɔeba la, ewɔ nu nyui aɖe.
I can’t take much more than that	Nyemate ŋu axɔ nu geɖe wu ema o
I told you what was going to happen.	Megblɔ nu si ava dzɔ la na wò.
Over time, it can happen.	Le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe la, ate ŋu adzɔ.
There is no need for more.	Mehiã be woawɔ nu geɖe wu o.
And for a long time, it worked very well.	Eye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe la, ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
Nothing has ever worked.	Naneke mewɔ dɔ kpɔ o.
But if you can.	Gake ne àte ŋui la.
But I really liked his work	Gake eƒe dɔa dze ŋunye ŋutɔ
I saw this, speechless	Mekpɔ esia, nyemete ŋu ƒo nu o
This is for them.	Esia nye na wo.
I had to stay strong	Ele be manɔ anyi sesĩe
I want to get out there and help people	Medi be mado go le afima akpe ɖe amewo ŋu
He also lost his job.	Dɔ ge le esi hã.
I said it would be you	Megblɔ be wòe anye
Might as well just call now	Ðewohĩ anyo be maƒo ka fifia ko
I can pick up a job here	Mate ŋu afɔ dɔ le afisia
Or maybe the real thing.	Alo ɖewohĩ nu ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Nothing in sight yet.	Naneke mele ŋku dzi haɖe o.
Things get a little interesting here.	Nuwo va doa dzidzɔ na ame vie le afisia.
Obviously, he could never do that.	Edze ƒã be mate ŋu awɔ nu ma gbeɖe o.
But it may not be the case.	Gake ɖewohĩ manɔ nenema o.
I know there is still much to be done	Menya be nu geɖe gakpɔtɔ li woawɔ
I couldn’t decide who to talk to	Nyemete ŋu tso nya me le amesi maƒo nu kplii ŋu o
But there was something missing.	Gake nane nɔ anyi si bu.
At this time of the year.	Le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
That’s a good thing.	Nya nyui aɖee nye ema.
I couldn’t do anything though	Nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke o gake
I can put this all together by myself	Nye ɖeka mate ŋu aƒo esia katã nu ƒu
And for hours.	Eye gaƒoƒo geɖe.
I had no idea what he was looking for	Nyemenya nu si dim wònɔ o
I can’t let you go	Nyemate ŋu aɖe asi le ŋuwò o
I definitely have the room.	Xɔa le asinye godoo.
I want to be in the car at about four	Medi be manɔ ʋua me le abe ga ene ene
Do it right this time	Wɔe nyuie zi sia
This is a good city for him too.	Esia nye du nyui aɖe na eya hã.
You seem very satisfied yourself.	Edze abe wò ŋutɔ wò dzi dze eme ŋutɔ ene.
That’s why it’s there.	Esia tae wòle afima ɖo.
This took some time.	Esia xɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I will go with them.	Mayi kpli wo.
But do it anyway.	Gake wɔe to mɔ sia mɔ nu.
But we had very little.	Gake nu sue aɖe koe nɔ mía si.
I never expected this	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na esia kpɔ o
There is no time limit.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli o.
It’s like another home for me.	Ele abe aƒe bubu ene nam.
Without that, we couldn’t do this program.	Ema manɔmee la, míate ŋu awɔ ɖoɖo sia o.
I want to congratulate you	Medi be mado dzidzɔ na wò
I was able to quit quickly and quickly	Mete ŋu dzudzɔ kaba kple kaba
But he couldn’t do anything.	Gake mete ŋu wɔ naneke o.
I can’t comment on that	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke tso ema ŋu o
Where it is located.	Afisi wòle.
I think that’s what you’re looking for.	Mesusu be emae nye nusi dim nèle.
On the other hand, there may have been nothing to work with.	Le go bubu me la, ɖewohĩ naneke menɔ anyi si ŋu woawɔ dɔ le o.
There doesn’t have to be a way.	Mehiã be mɔ aɖe li o.
I can’t say anything yet	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖeke haɖe o
He will have a good time in it.	Akpɔ ɣeyiɣi nyui aɖe le eme.
His death, our life.	Eƒe ku, míaƒe agbe.
It was a shock to me.	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ.
I wanted to do something difficult	Medi be mawɔ nu sesẽ aɖe
I was really very happy	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ŋutɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ
The same rule should apply in this case.	Ele be se ma ke nawɔ dɔ le nya sia me.
That guy had a gun.	Tu nɔ ŋutsu ma si.
I thought he would listen to me.	Mesusu be aɖo tom.
Not very interesting as a place.	Menye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ abe teƒe ene o.
There is also a good reason.	Susu nyui aɖe hã tae.
That would be good for them.	Ema anyo na wo.
I don’t know about you	Nyemenya nu tso ŋuwò o
Think about what you like.	Bu nusi dzɔa dzi na wò ŋu kpɔ.
I knew something good would come out of this	Menya be nu nyui aɖe ado tso esia me

For your time.	Le wò ɣeyiɣi ta.
I have to do this myself	Ele be nye ŋutɔ mawɔ esia
Go ahead and tell us everything you think you know.	Yi ŋgɔ nàgblɔ nusianu si nèsusu be yenya la na mí.
I usually want to have the last word in everything .	Zi geɖe la, medi be magblɔ nya mamlɛtɔ le nusianu me .
When things were good.	Esi nuwo nɔ nyuie hafi.
I know everything about you	Menya nusianu tso ŋuwò
Stay right there.	Nɔ afima tututu.
Like your dog.	Abe wò avu ene.
I gave you the full name	Metsɔ ŋkɔ bliboa na wò
I couldn’t imagine how this would play out	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ alesi esia awɔe le susu me o
Things that stay with you.	Nu siwo nɔa ŋuwò.
I didn't come out.	Meva do o.
I couldn’t see where we were	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ afisi míele o
Everything is right.	Nusianu sɔ.
That wasn’t happening.	Ema menɔ edzi yim o.

Or a part of it.	Alo eƒe akpa aɖe.
That would be tomorrow though.	Ema anye etsɔ ke hã.
I want to spend time with him	Medi be makpɔ ɣeyiɣi ɖe eŋu
I thought it would be easy to get into this	Mesusu be anɔ bɔbɔe be mava ge ɖe esia me
Nothing interested him.	Naneke metsɔ ɖe le eme o.
Very different from me.	To vovo kura tso nye gbɔ.
It wasn’t easy.	Menɔ bɔbɔe o.
I think it might help you	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ akpe ɖe ŋuwò
I can’t promise that.	Nyemate ŋu ado ŋugbe nenema o.
There is water in it.	Metsi le eme.
I don’t know what to do with myself	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o
I had an issue with him.	Nya aɖe nɔ asinye kplii.
I wasn’t the only one in the room	Menye nye ɖeka koe nɔ xɔa me o
I have a lot of money now	Ga geɖe le asinye fifia
Two things happened.	Nu eve aɖewo dzɔ.
But there were a lot of people he really liked.	Gake ame geɖe nɔ anyi siwo ƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I just found myself in the same situation.	Mekpɔ ɖokuinye le nɔnɔme ma ke me fifia ko.
I heard that was really interesting	Mese be ema do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
I know what to do about that.	Menya nusi mawɔ tso ema ŋu.
More than ever.	Wu ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe.
I think you know where it is	Mesusu be ènya afisi wòle
Perhaps because of this.	Ðewohĩ le esia ta.
And there will be something on it soon.	Eye nane anɔ edzi kpuie.
I need to know what’s going on	Ele be manya nusi le edzi yim
I want to see you now	Medi be makpɔ wò fifia
I just remember being familiar with this	Ðeko meɖo ŋku edzi be menya nu tso esia ŋu nyuie
A house that has seen some seriously better days	Aƒe si kpɔ ŋkeke aɖewo siwo nyo wu vevie kpɔ
If you have any questions, please ask me.	Ne nya aɖe le asiwò la, taflatse biam.
I'm sure you're surprised.	Meka ɖe edzi be ewɔ nuku na wò.
It worked really well.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
We never had any issues.	Nya aɖeke menɔ mía dome kpɔ o.
He didn’t recognize anyone, either.	Mekpɔ ame aɖeke dze sii o, eya hã.
That wouldn’t work.	Ema mawɔ dɔ o.
I would love to be there	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be manɔ afima
I can’t let you do that	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ na wò be nàwɔ nu ma o
Maybe someone will be home.	Ðewohĩ ame aɖe anɔ aƒeme.
I felt everything.	Mese nusianu le ɖokuinye me.
I shouldn’t be eating them	Mele be manɔ wo ɖum o
This could be a very long night.	Esia ate ŋu anye zã didi aɖe ŋutɔ.
I want to make that money	Medi be makpɔ ga ma
He has two children.	Vi eve le esi.
I would love to see more of these people in person.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be makpɔ ame siawo dometɔ geɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
But this doesn’t matter much to me.	Gake esia mele vevie nam boo o.
I don’t know much about it.	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o.
No one else can do this for you.	Ame bubu aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ esia na wò o.
He doesn’t care about me, not now.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam o, menye fifia o.
Life is hard without you.	Agbe sesẽ wò manɔmee.
My life will end .	Nye agbe awu enu .
His voice was louder than she expected.	Eƒe gbe sesẽ wu alesi wònɔ mɔ kpɔm nɛ.
He certainly wouldn’t.	Mawɔe nenema o godoo.
There is a long road ahead.	Mɔ didi aɖe le ŋgɔ gbɔna.
The reason here is twofold.	Susu si le afisia nye eve.
Let me explain.	Mina maɖe eme.
It was the last thing he did.	Enye nu mamlɛtɔ si wòwɔ.
I might go for that one too	Ðewohĩ mayi ɖe ɖeka ma hã ta
Or making them.	Alo wo wɔwɔ.
I'm not here, too real	Nyemele afisia o, ame ŋutɔŋutɔ akpa
This will not work.	Esia mawɔ dɔ o.
I think it will be good	Mesusu be anyo
I know this very well	Menya esia nyuie
Other than that, it was a good day.	Ne menye ema o la, ŋkeke nyui aɖee wònye.
It doesn’t matter if you’re not my first.	Mehiã be menye wòe nye nye gbãtɔ o.
Everyone has stuck to that so far.	Amesiame lé ema me ɖe asi sesĩe vaseɖe fifia.
I didn’t expect you, or anyone, really	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na wò, alo ame aɖeke, ŋutɔŋutɔ o
And it was there, too.	Eye wònɔ anyi hã.
He didn’t seem to say anything.	Edze abe megblɔ nya aɖeke o ene.
Something he will work on this summer.	Nane si ŋu wòawɔ dɔ le le dzomeŋɔli sia me.
I can help you, and you are	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò, eye wò hã nye
Pay attention when a man comes to my room.	Lé ŋku ɖe eŋu ne ŋutsu aɖe va nye xɔ me.
I knew he had something on his mind	Menya be nane le susu me nɛ
I was actually doing this	Menɔ esia wɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ
Perhaps he will do the same.	Ðewohĩ eya hã awɔe nenema.
I like the whole project so far	Dɔa katã dzɔa dzi nam vaseɖe fifia
Something passed through his face.	Nane to eƒe mo.
No one has ever done this before.	Ame aɖeke mewɔ esia kpɔ o.
A few feet away was another	Afɔ ʋɛ aɖewo tso afima la, bubu hã nɔ afima
These books are good.	Agbalẽ siawo nyo.
And not much else.	Eye menye nu bubu geɖe o.
They did it, they did it, they did it.	Wɔe, wɔe, wɔe.
I said it was easy.	Megblɔ be ele bɔbɔe.
I think we can do with one	Mesusu be míate ŋu awɔe kple ɖeka
I can feed you plenty	Mate ŋu ana nuɖuɖu wò geɖe
I will beat myself up	Maƒo ɖokuinye
I hope it helps someone.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be akpe ɖe ame aɖe ŋu.
I have to go now and talk to my people	Ele be mayi azɔ aƒo nu kple nye amewo
I remember it like it was yesterday	Meɖo ŋku edzi abe etsɔ ene
Yet now he seems completely unaware.	Ke hã fifia edze abe menya kura o ene.
Be a man.	Nye ŋutsu.
I don’t have to work	Mehiã be mawɔ dɔ o
I can give him that at least	Mate ŋu ana emae ya teti
In fact, this is not the case.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia mele nenema o.
I am going to miss everyone a lot	Mele amesiame susu ge ŋutɔ
There is usually a good reason for this.	Zi geɖe la, susu nyui aɖe nɔa esia ŋu.
I couldn’t be wrong.	Nyemete ŋu gblẽ o.
My hand went to my sword.	Nye asi yi nye yi gbɔ.
I would still like to do that	Madi kokoko be mawɔ ema
But it doesn’t matter now.	Gake mehiã fifia o.
I can’t imagine how that would play out	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi ema awɔe le susu me o
I liked the attention	Alesi amewo lé ŋku ɖe nu ŋui la dze ŋunye
He should have nothing better to do.	Mele be naneke si nyo wu nanɔ esi wòawɔ o.
I let go of ne quickly though	Meɖe asi le ne ŋu kaba ya ya
I can do without it	Mate ŋu awɔe eya manɔmee
He gave us and him too.	Etsɔ mía kple eya hã na.
I can’t tell you this anymore	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya sia na mi azɔ o
I am in control of it	Mele edzi ɖum
I apologize for this	Meɖe kuku ɖe esia ta
But only a little bit.	Gake vi aɖe koe.
Not sure if that was worth it	Nyemeka ɖe edzi nenye be ema ɖe vi nam o
Which obviously doesn’t go your way.	Nusi edze ƒã be mewɔ ɖeka kple wò mɔ o.
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
It can be almost anywhere.	Ate ŋu anɔ afi sia afi kloe.
The idea is very similar.	Susu la ɖi ŋutɔ.
Perhaps you are the only one speaking.	Ðewohĩ wò ɖeka koe le nu ƒom.
I knew something was wrong	Menya be nane gblẽ
It’s the last thing that needs to be done.	Enye nu mamlɛtɔ si wòle be woawɔ.
Maybe I’ll see you next week	Ðewohĩ makpɔ wò le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me
There aren’t exactly people there.	Amewo mele afima tututu o.
I couldn’t think of anything to say.	Nyemete ŋu bu nya aɖeke ŋu magblɔ o.
I didn’t want to upset him.	Nyemedi be mado dziku nɛ o.
I know what it was like	Menya ale si wònɔ
I had plenty of time and always did more	Ɣeyiɣi geɖe nɔ asinye eye mewɔa geɖe wu ɣesiaɣi
He didn’t keep his word.	Mewɔ ɖe eƒe nya dzi o.
It was a pleasure to work with him.	Enye dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ be woawɔ dɔ kplii.
There is something we can try.	Nane li si míate ŋu ate kpɔ.
If something works, well, that’s it.	Ne nane wɔ dɔ la, nyuie, emae nye ema.
He didn’t say anything to me either.	Megblɔ nya aɖeke nam hã o.
It doesn’t seem to work though.	Edze abe mewɔa dɔ o ke hã.
I don’t know why I’m here	Nyemenya nusita mele afisia o
I really need to talk to him today	Ehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ be maƒo nu kplii egbea
I am the only one who is.	Nye ɖeka koe nye nye.
I know how important this is to you	Menya ale si gbegbe esia le vevie na mi
I think he did a good job	Mesusu be ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe
You may be surprised at the reasons for the same.	Ðewohĩ susu siwo tae wòle nenema ke la awɔ nuku na wò.
I know his first name.	Menya eƒe ŋkɔ gbãtɔ.
And that includes food and water.	Eye nuɖuɖu kple tsi hã le eme.
Four men and himself.	Ŋutsu ene kple eya ŋutɔ.
A man can endure anything	Ŋutsu ate ŋu ado dzi le nusianu me
We can’t do that.	Míate ŋu awɔ ema o.
That is necessary for a balanced life.	Ema hiã hafi agbe si da sɔ nanɔ ame si.
But I couldn’t find it.	Gake nyemete ŋu ke ɖe eŋu o.
I can marry her now	Mate ŋu aɖee fifia
Just, believe me.	Ðeko, xɔ dzinye se.
You are someone who has things.	Ènye ame aɖe si si nuwo le.
You are not a good person.	Menye ame nyuie nènye o.
But people did go.	Gake amewo yi nyateƒe.
I had just told him everything	Ðeko megblɔ nya sia nya nɛ teti koe nye ema
I wasn’t supposed to say that.	Menye ɖe wòle be magblɔ nya ma o.
In fact, two years later.	Le nyateƒe me la, ƒe eve megbe.
That used to annoy me.	Ema doa dziku nam tsã.
I can’t live with you	Nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi kpli wò o
I could have done it.	Anye ne mate ŋu awɔe hafi.
I know you can remember what that looks like	Menya be àte ŋu aɖo ŋku alesi ema le dzi
I don’t want that moment	Nyemedi ɣeyiɣi ma o
He did what no one else would do	Mewɔ nusi ame bubu aɖeke mawɔ o
If the or for.	Ne la alo na.
Or, you can accept the truth.	Alo, àte ŋu axɔ nyateƒea.
I have to fire this guy	Ele nam be maɖe ŋutsu sia le dɔ me
But he won’t talk.	Gake maƒo nu o.
It’s a very popular thing.	Enye nusi xɔ ŋkɔ ŋutɔ.
I am not here to speak there.	Menye ɖe mele afisia be maƒo nu le afima o.
I thought he would have a great house	Mesusu be aƒe gã aɖe anɔ esi
I want to know everything	Medi be manya nusianu
Go ahead and do just that.	Yi ŋgɔ nàwɔ nu ma tututu.
Not through anything.	Menye to naneke dzi o.
I doubt one ever did	Meke ɖi be ɖeka wɔe kpɔ
And that's it.	Le eya ta.
I'll join you soon	Mawɔ ɖeka kpli wò kpuie
He can endure that.	Ate ŋu ado dzi le ema me.
It was never a good idea.	Menye susu nyui aɖeke gbeɖe o.
I think this is one of them	Mesusu be esia nye wo dometɔ ɖeka
I distanced myself from him.	Meɖe ɖokuinye ɖa le eŋu.
I couldn’t decide.	Nyemete ŋu tso nya me o.
A voice said in his head	Gbe aɖe gblɔ le eƒe ta me
I just didn’t expect this	Ðeko nyemekpɔ mɔ na esia o
Can’t we just get along?.	Ðe míate ŋu awɔ nu ɖekae ko oa?.
He is now in good shape.	Ele nɔnɔme nyui me fifia.
There’s nothing in his town for you.	Naneke mele eƒe du me na wò o.
It’s not a small thing	Menye nu sue aɖee wònye o
Think of it that way.	Bu eŋu nenema.
I never know what to say.	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ gbeɖe o.
I can’t live with that anger	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe kple dziku ma o
The room went to one place.	Xɔa me yi teƒe ɖeka.
It would have been so much easier.	Anye ne anɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I sent it right	Meɖoe ɖe eŋu nyuie
I'm sure he was doing more too	Meka ɖe edzi be eya hã nɔ nu wɔm geɖe wu
There is something that will happen as a result.	Nane li si adzɔ le esia ta.
I didn’t touch any of them at all	Nyemeka asi wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu kura o
It will kill someone.	Awu ame.
It wouldn’t bother him a bit.	Maɖe fu nɛ vie o.
I think this is the case.	Mesusu be esia le alea.
The truth is clearer.	Nyateƒea me kɔ wu.
Once you do that, change your gun.	Ne ènya wɔe nenema ko la, trɔ wò tu.
I was one of them.	Menye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
If you are a real person.	Ne ènye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ la.
This is not like you.	Esia mele abe wò ene o.
I knew they were in the house somewhere.	Menya be wole aƒea me le afi aɖe.
I don't deserve to be treated that way	Medze be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋunye nenema o
He really liked her.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
New town, new home.	Du yeye, aƒe yeye.
I just got so attached	Ðeko meva ku ɖe eŋu ale gbegbe
How you get there is a little different for each of us.	Ale si nàwɔ aɖo afima la to vovo vie na mía dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
I took a step back	Meɖe afɔ ɖeka yi megbe
In fact, it can’t be anything.	Le nyateƒe me la, mate ŋu anye naneke o.
Think about it, once in your life.	Bu eŋu kpɔ, zi ɖeka le wò agbe me.
I know this about him.	Menya esia tso eŋu.
But to each his own.	Gake na wo dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe eya ŋutɔ tɔ.
I never wanted to be that impressive	Nyemedi gbeɖe be mawɔ dɔ ɖe ame dzi nenema gbegbe o
I know you have lost a lot	Menya be nu geɖe bu na wò
I don’t think you had anything.	Nyemesusu be naneke menɔ ŋuwò o.
I could never allow that	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ nenema gbeɖe o
But I still liked him	Gake eƒe nu lé dzi nam kokoko
I don’t have a problem with that	Nyemekpɔ kuxi aɖeke le ema ŋu o
You know it will always be there.	Ènya be anɔ eme ɣesiaɣi.
So was he, too.	Eya hã nɔ nenema.
He can go there.	Ate ŋu ayi afima.
One of the people closest to me	Ame siwo te ɖe ŋunye wu la dometɔ ɖeka
There’s just no room there.	Ðeko teƒe aɖeke mele afima o.
But it didn’t last long.	Gake menɔ anyi didi o.
He couldn’t prove it.	Mete ŋu ɖo kpe edzi o.
This is more than that.	Esia nye nusi wu ema.
I always have this.	Esia le asinye ɣesiaɣi.
I have a lot of space now	Teƒe geɖe le asinye fifia
Not sure what to make of it.	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ tso eŋu dzi o.
He never came out.	Medo go gbeɖe o.
I have never been so depressed.	Nyemete ɖe ɖokuinye dzi nenema gbegbe kpɔ o.
He couldn’t stay here.	Mete ŋu nɔ afisia o.
I need to know everything	Ele be manya nusianu
No one wants them.	Ame aɖeke medi wo o.
I could not for the life of me remember his name	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi le nye agbe me o
You seem to know a few things.	Edze abe ènya nu ʋɛ aɖewo ene.
To create inconsistent characters.	Be woawɔ ame siwo mewɔ ɖeka kple wo nɔewo o.
That sounds simple.	Ema ɖi nu bɔbɔe aɖe.
I want to negotiate with him as well	Medi be mawɔ ɖoɖo kplii hã
I know it’s because of me	Menya be nyee tae
If anything, its the opposite.	Ne nane li la, eƒe nusi tsi tre ɖe eŋu.
I was here now.	Menɔ afisia fifia.
I wonder what I did wrong.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae mewɔ nu gbegblẽ hã.
Please call now.	Taflatse ƒo ka fifia.
I was talking through my sweat, man, through my blood	Menɔ nu ƒom to nye fifia me, ŋutsu, to nye ʋu me
You can go.	Àte ŋu ayi.
I was very impressed with him.	Eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I only saw them live twice	Zi eve koe mekpɔ wo le agbe
Over the next several years.	Le ƒe geɖe siwo gbɔna me.
Me or me.	Nye alo nye.
But many of them are more interesting.	Gake wo dometɔ geɖe doa dzidzɔ na ame wu.
Who is bothering me.	Ame si le fu ɖem nam.
I was deeply impressed	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye vevie
It was very impressive	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe dzinye ŋutɔ
This time will come upon us.	Ɣeyiɣi sia ava mía dzi.
I knew he would want me to continue	Menya be adi be mayi edzi
I can see where we are	Mete ŋu kpɔa afisi míele
I couldn’t think of them together	Nyemete ŋu bu wo ɖekae o
He couldn’t sit in his car all night.	Mete ŋu nɔ anyi ɖe eƒe ʋu me zã bliboa o.
I squinted but couldn’t see anything	Meɖe ŋku ɖe nu ŋu gake nyemete ŋu kpɔ naneke o
I had seen them tonight	Mekpɔ wo le zã sia me kpɔ
Honestly, I’m not quite sure what to say	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemeka ɖe nya si magblɔ dzi tututu o
I think that’s everything	Mesusu be emae nye nusianu
I want to take the time to talk to you.	Medi be makpɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖo dze kpli wò.
Can someone please help me.	Ðe ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye taflatse.
I can’t live without the summer	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe le dzomeŋɔli la manɔmee o
I let you do that.	Meɖe mɔ na wò be nàwɔ nu ma.
He has a big heart.	Dzi gã aɖe le esi.
I don’t see anything wrong with it	Nyemekpɔ naneke si gblẽ le eŋu o
It could be anything.	Ate ŋu anye nusianu.
But try it.	Gake dze agbagba.
And that is very possible.	Eye ema ate ŋu adzɔ ŋutɔ.
Start cars that won’t.	Dze ʋu siwo mawɔe o gɔme.
But it is impossible.	Gake manya wɔ o.
He is giving it all his attention now.	Ele eƒe susu katã nam fifia.
I have to be somewhere	Ele be manɔ afi aɖe
I was anxious to do better	Metsi dzi vevie be mawɔ nu nyuie wu
Not this year.	Menye le ƒe sia me o.
Nice to see you here.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mekpɔ wò le afisia.
I am completely single.	Nyee nye tre kura.
I can easily imagine the characters in my mind	Mete ŋu kpɔa ame siwo le nye susu me la le susu me bɔbɔe
Much has to be done	Ele be woawɔ nu geɖe
He is in it in life and he will never go out.	Ele eme le agbe me eye mado go gbeɖe o.
I work in a vacant job	Mewɔa dɔ le dɔ si me ame aɖeke mele o me
I was going backwards	Menɔ megbe yim
And it may be true.	Eye ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
I really like the idea	Susu la dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
Its former location is the same as here.	Afisi wònɔ tsã la sɔ kple afisia.
He will take the job.	Axɔ dɔa.
There were many difficult problems	Kuxi sesẽ geɖe nɔ anyi
I can’t live without her	Nyemate ŋu anɔ agbe eya manɔmee o
I gave my word	Metsɔ nye nya la na
Any help would be appreciated.	Kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe aɖe vi.
He has to fight through himself.	Ele be wòawɔ avu to eɖokui me.
In fact, I might be able to finish them tonight	Le nyateƒe me la, ɖewohĩ mate ŋu awu wo nu le zã sia me
But he didn’t ask any questions.	Gake mebia nya aɖeke o.
I felt very, very small and very, very nervous	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mele sue ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ eye metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ
There are two reasons for this expectation.	Susu eve aɖewo tae wole mɔ kpɔm na esia ɖo.
Look at who he is.	Kpɔ amesi wònye ɖa.
You are the one who	Wòe nye ame si .
This worked very well.	Esia wɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ.
I didn’t have to do that	Mehiã be mawɔ nu ma o
However, we can do better.	Ke hã, míate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu.
I wondered what this could be	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae esia ate ŋu anye hã
It felt like no one else was there.	Ewɔ nam abe ame bubu aɖeke mele afima o ene.
I approached him more quickly	Mete ɖe eŋu kaba wu
I wanted to know what he was really doing	Medi be manya nusi tututu wɔm wònɔ
I hope you have an easier time	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ɣeyiɣi aɖe anɔ asiwò bɔbɔe wu
I have no reason to be tired.	Susu aɖeke meli si tae ɖeɖi te ŋunye o.
I couldn’t figure out what was in it	Nyemete ŋu nya nusi nɔ eme o
I know what you are doing	Menya nusi wɔm nèle
People didn’t care about him.	Amewo metsɔ ɖeke le eme nɛ o.
For that, he will need money.	Le ema ta la, ahiã ga.
Maybe he’s busy.	Ðewohĩ vovo mele eŋu o.
That’s probably why.	Anɔ eme be esia tae.
I don’t know much more than you	Nyemenya nu boo aɖeke wu wò o
I knew them in the past	Menya wo le mɔ si va yi me
He didn’t care.	Metsɔ ɖeke le eme o.
Or kill himself.	Alo awu eɖokui.
Have a nice day people.	Ŋkeke nyui na amewo.
It will take years.	Axɔ ƒe geɖe.
It’s all too little, too late.	Wo katã wole sue akpa, tsi megbe akpa.
I just couldn’t go.	Ðeko nyemete ŋu yi o.
That’s a good idea.	Susu nyuie nye ema.
He didn’t want to sit around and help anyone.	Medi be yeanɔ anyi akpe ɖe ame aɖeke ŋu o.
He had a better idea.	Susu si nyo wu nɔ esi.
Try things out on it.	Te nuwo kpɔ le edzi.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I just need to know it’s there	Ðeko wòle be manya be ele afima
I really stepped in this time	Meɖe afɔ ɖe eme ŋutɔŋutɔ zi sia
I refused, for many reasons.	Megbe, le susu geɖe ta.
I want to get out of here soon.	Medi be mado le afisia kpuie.
In the back of the year.	Le megbe la ƒe ƒe.
I couldn’t resist it	Nyemete ŋu tsi tre ɖe eŋu o
Maybe I should give it up	Ðewohĩ ele be maɖe asi le eŋu
That was a nice place.	Teƒe nyui aɖee nye ema.
Everyone had a great time.	Amesiame kpɔ ɣeyiɣi gã aɖe.
I don’t know anything about it	Nyemenya naneke tso eŋu o
Things are hard enough for him as it is.	Nuwo sesẽ nɛ ale gbegbe abe alesi wòle ene.
He did a great job.	Ewɔ dɔ gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
I can do that, you know	Mate ŋu awɔ ema, ènya
I couldn’t figure out how to do that	Nyemete ŋu bu alesi mawɔ emae ŋu o
As clear as can be.	Eme kɔ nyuie alesi wòate ŋui.
It will endure almost anything.	Ado dzi le nusianu kloe me.
I had never heard of him.	Nyemese eƒe nya kpɔ o.
I have so much to do	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le asinye mawɔ
But he was seriously ill.	Gake eƒe lãme gblẽ vevie.
I have something to say to him.	Nya aɖe le asinye magblɔ nɛ.
I was fine with that.	Menɔ nyuie le nya ma me.
No problem yet.	Kuxi aɖeke meli haɖe o.
I knew what was going on there	Menya nusi nɔ edzi yim le afima
But you must have missed something.	Gake nane anya to ŋuwò.
There are two reasons.	Susu eve aɖewo tae.
I am right there and in the now	Mele afima tututu eye mele fifia hã me
It didn’t surprise me at all.	Mewɔ nuku nam kura o.
Not four yet.	Menye ene haɖe o.
None of it matters when morning comes.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mele vevie ne ŋdi ɖo o.
Just his own.	Eya ŋutɔ tɔ ko.
But this wasn’t the case.	Gake esia menɔ nenema o.

I heard he was new to our species	Mese be enye ame yeye le mía ƒomevi me
Thanks a lot, you really know your stuff.	Akpe geɖe, ènya wò nuwo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
No one will talk to us.	Ame aɖeke maƒo nu na mí o.
I just didn’t feel satisfied	Ðeko nyemese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme o
It’s just not the same without them.	Ðeko wòle nenema wo manɔmee o.
It takes courage	Ehiã be dzi nanɔ ame ƒo
No one could touch me.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu ka asi ŋunye o.
I have been in the same situation in the past.	Nɔnɔme ma ke me tom hã va yi.
I haven’t seen anyone else here all day	Nyemekpɔ ame bubu aɖeke le afisia ŋkeke bliboa o
We will try one last time.	Míate kpɔ zi mamlɛtɔ.

It wouldn’t be at all.	Anɔ eme kura o.
They didn’t have any money.	Ga aɖeke menɔ wo si o.
And, keep going.	Eye, yi edzi.
I felt a lot of blood	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ʋu geɖe le lãme nam
I did that, just now.	Mewɔ ema, fifia ko.
And so it is, too.	Eye nenema ke hã.
I have no anger	Dziku aɖeke mele ŋunye o
Any day next week is good.	Ŋkeke ɖesiaɖe si gbɔna le kwasiɖa si gbɔna me la nyo.
There is no bad room in the house.	Xɔ gbegblẽ aɖeke mele aƒea me o.
It was too soon for him.	Ewɔ kaba akpa nɛ.
Two people got out of the car.	Ame eve do go le ʋua me.
I really enjoyed this book	Agbalẽ sia do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
That’s what they’re there for.	Ema tae wole afima ɖo.

I’m just not like that.	Ðeko nyemele nenema o.
I know what we have to do	Menya nu si wòle be míawɔ

But this is something different.	Gake esia nye nusi to vovo.
One more point.	Nya ɖeka bubu.
I spent some time talking to him this morning	Metsɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe ƒo nu kplii ŋdi sia
A thousand words.	Nya akpe ɖeka.
That's me.	Nyee nye ema.
They passed me the first time.	Wo to ŋunye zi gbãtɔ.

I couldn’t forget your face	Nyemete ŋu ŋlɔ wò mo be o
And a man ran out.	Eye ŋutsu aɖe ƒu du do go.

And I’m fascinated too.	Eye nye hã nu dzɔa dzi nam.
I wonder what that says? 	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae ema gblɔ hã?
I was in a strange place with strange people	Menɔ teƒe aɖe si nyemenya o kple ame siwo nyemenya o
I got this error	Mexɔ vodada sia

I don’t want to organize	Nyemedi be mawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe nu ŋu o

You can do it at night.	Àte ŋu awɔe le zã me.
I can’t say exactly what it is	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi tututu wònye o
We don’t know much about it.	Míenya nu boo aɖeke tso eŋu o.
Every case is different.	Nya ɖesiaɖe to vovo.

Today, the reality is quite different.	Egbea la, nyateƒea to vovo kura.
If anyone can help me, they can.	Ne ame aɖe ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye la, ate ŋui.
I don't want to know	Madi be manya
You have to do something with it.	Ele be nàwɔ nane kplii.

Maybe this was once a mistake.	Ðewohĩ vodada aɖee esia nye tsã.

I doubt much will come of that.	Meke ɖi be nu geɖe ado tso ema me.

Something needs to be done about them.	Ele be woawɔ nane tso wo ŋu.
I think that’s why we’re here	Mesusu be esia tae míele afisia ɖo

He wasn’t going anywhere.	Menɔ afi aɖeke yim o.
His mouth opened.	Eƒe nu ʋu.
I'm going backwards.	Mele megbe yim.
I had already lost everything	Nusianu bu nam xoxo
I resisted at this point	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu le ɣeyiɣi sia me
Your life isn’t like that.	Wò agbe mele nenema o.
I missed a big one.	Gã aɖe to ŋunye.

In fact, he was comfortable with himself.	Le nyateƒe me la, eƒe dzi dze eme le eɖokui ŋu.

The night is gone.	Zã va yi.

But his mind was still clear.	Gake eƒe susu me kɔ kokoko.

You’re in charge of it.	Wòe kpɔa edzi.
But I have to have your word on this	Gake ele be wò nya nanɔ asinye le esia ŋu
I did have a place to go	Teƒe aɖe nɔ asinye mayi nyateƒe
We just don’t know what’s real.	Ðeko míenya nusi nye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I was hoping you knew what was going on	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be ènya nusi le edzi yim
He nuzzled his head into my neck.	Etsɔ eƒe ta ƒo ɖe nye kɔ me.
But I can’t be mad at him	Gake nyemate ŋu ado dziku ɖe eŋu o
Some kind of thing.	Nu aɖe ƒomevi.
I have achieved this.	Meɖo esia gbɔ.
This we know.	Esia míenya.
You can save us, maybe.	Àte ŋu aɖe mí, ɖewohĩ.
I have a reputation for excellence and efficiency	Ŋkɔ le asinye be mewɔa nu nyuie wu eye mewɔa dɔ nyuie
I could kind of see them.	Mete ŋu kpɔ wo le mɔ aɖe nu.
I want to know who he is	Medi be manya amesi wònye
I tried to speak but nothing would come out	Medze agbagba be maƒo nu gake naneke mado go o
That was very exciting.	Ema do dzidzɔ na ame ŋutɔ.
I also felt your anger.	Mese wò dziku hã le ɖokuinye me.
But that’s just me.	Gake nye koe nye ema.
A car ran over him.	Ʋu aɖe ƒu du va dze edzi.
I would have to say that.	Ahiã be magblɔ nya ma.
He seemed to enjoy it.	Edze abe edzɔ dzi nɛ ene.
There can be nothing else.	Nu bubu aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ anyi o.
I couldn’t control myself	Nyemete ŋu ɖu ɖokuinye dzi o
I really want to talk to you.	Medi vevie be maƒo nu kpli wò.
I did give him this	Metsɔ esia nɛ nyateƒe
I’m not the only one doing this	Menye nye ɖeka koe le esia wɔm o
I know we have some very smart people here	Menya be ame aɖewo siwo dze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ la le mía si le afisia
Maybe not this time.	Ðewohĩ menye ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
Please bear with us.	Taflatse gbɔ dzi ɖi na mí.
I don’t think anyone was there.	Nyemesusu be ame aɖeke menɔ afima o.
I can't figure out what's going on with this	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusi le edzi yim le esia ŋu o
I can’t be mad at that	Nyemate ŋu anɔ dziku dom ɖe ema ŋu o
I tried to see how I liked him	Medze agbagba be makpɔ alesi eƒe nu lé dzi nam
I don’t know my name	Nyemenya nye ŋkɔ o
People have abandoned us.	Amewo gblẽ mí ɖi.
They seem to be enjoying themselves.	Edze abe wole dzidzɔ kpɔm ene.
I need to know everything.	Ele be manya nusianu.
I just couldn’t resist them	Ðeko nyemete ŋu tsi tre ɖe wo ŋu o
I know how much it means to you	Menya alesi gbegbe wòle vevie na wòe
I can’t handle this.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ o.
He lost his character.	Eƒe nɔnɔme bu.
It’s personal.	Enye ame ŋutɔ tɔ.
I was the one who started it.	Nyee nye ame si dze egɔme.
I don’t think it really matters	Mesusu be mehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ o
He threw himself into another solemn face.	Etsɔ eɖokui ƒu gbe ɖe mo bubu si me bubu le me.
I have an idea of ​​what is going on	Nusi le edzi yim ƒe susu aɖe le asinye
My strong one.	Nye sesẽ la.
That’s my name.	Emae nye nye ŋkɔ.
However, it still doesn’t work.	Ke hã, mewɔa dɔ kokoko o.
I was already on it	Menɔ edzi xoxo
Where it is located.	Afisi wòle.
I can’t do this for you anymore	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia na wò azɔ o
The same thing again.	Nu ma ke ake hã.
I had to tell him what happened.	Ele be magblɔ nusi dzɔ la nɛ.
He’s been in a bad mood.	Eƒe lãme gblẽ le eŋu.
It seems like a must.	Edze abe nusi wòle be woawɔ ene.
But what about the wind.	Gake ya ɖe.
We have a couple of issues.	Nya eve aɖewo le mía si.
I want to do the same	Medi be mawɔ nenema ke
Not when he was satisfied.	Menye esime eƒe dzi dze eme o.
I had no voice.	Gbe aɖeke menɔ asinye o.
Any help and ideas would be helpful.	Kpekpeɖeŋu kple susu ɖesiaɖe akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
Sword, in fact, he gave me a sword	Yi, le nyateƒe me la, etsɔ yi nam
Now he has one, somehow.	Fifia ɖeka le esi, le mɔ aɖe nu.
Men you can have.	Ŋutsu siwo ate ŋu anɔ asiwò.
I think it will come much sooner	Mesusu be ava kaba wu kura
I can’t see myself with him	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ɖokuinye kplii o
But it can be there.	Gake ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
I did something else, too	Mewɔ nu bubu aɖe hã
I know some people out there who might be useful	Menya ame aɖewo le afima siwo ate ŋu aɖe vi
It was really hard work for me.	Enye dɔ sesẽ nam ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Bad problem, bad.	Kuxi gbegblẽ, gbegblẽ.
Root and seed.	Ke kple nuku.
Do what you have to do for you.	Wɔ nusi wòle be nàwɔ la na wò.
I am so worried about you too	Metsi dzi ɖe wò hã ŋu ale gbegbe
I think we’re all looking forward to it	Mesusu be mí katã míele mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie
And neither will anyone else.	Eye ame bubu aɖeke hã mawɔe nenema o.
You have them all in your hands.	Wo katã le asiwò.
Just thinking ahead though.	Do ŋgɔ ŋu bubu ko gake.
He is fighting it.	Ele avu wɔm kplii.
He didn’t come himself.	Menye eya ŋutɔ va o.
I’m here for a reason, for a reason	Susu aɖe tae meva afisia ɖo, le susu aɖe ta
I would have attacked him too	Anye ne medze eya hã dzi hafi
I was expecting much, much more	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na nu geɖe wu, geɖe wu
I couldn’t think of a word	Nyemete ŋu bu nya aɖeke ŋu o
But he didn’t fall.	Gake medze anyi o.
I am barely making it through school	Ƒã hafi mele edzi tom to suku me
I will do for myself.	Mawɔ nu na ɖokuinye.
Probably many times more.	Ðewohĩ zi gbɔ zi geɖe wu ema.
Couldn't ask for more, it seemed to me.	Mete ŋu bia nu geɖe wu ema o, edze nam.
That didn’t surprise him.	Ema mewɔ nuku nɛ o.
This was interesting tonight.	Esia do dzidzɔ na ame le zã sia me.
I told you it would be	Megblɔ na mi be anɔ nenema
So far he has done a good job.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ewɔ dɔ nyui aɖe.
We can get there without any problems.	Míate ŋu aɖo afima kuxi aɖeke manɔmee.
And it will be easy.	Eye anɔ bɔbɔe.
I have the same problem	Kuxi ma ke le ŋunye hã
That’s probably why.	Anɔ eme be esia tae.
None of them have stepped inside yet.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke meɖo afɔ eme haɖe o.
We are showing respect.	Míele bubu ɖem fia.
I have been against it for a long time.	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye sia.
I was too nervous to speak.	Metsi dzodzodzoe akpa be nyemate ŋu aƒo nu o.
I definitely know a couple of people who do that	Menya ame eve aɖewo siwo wɔa nu ma godoo
I should have done this days ago.	Ðe wòle be mawɔ esia ŋkeke siwo va yi hafi.
I never saw myself in that situation	Nyemekpɔ ɖokuinye le nɔnɔme ma me kpɔ o
It was just that way.	Ðeko wònɔ nenema.
I wondered what he could say	Mebia ɖokuinye be nukae wòate ŋu agblɔ hã
He obviously didn’t know the first thing about that.	Edze ƒã be menya nu gbãtɔ si ku ɖe ema ŋu o.
I can’t remember feeling this angry	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku edzi be mese le ɖokuinye me be medo dziku alea o
Which is difficult.	Nusi sesẽ.
I couldn’t really talk to him	Nyemete ŋu ƒo nu kplii ŋutɔŋutɔ o
I just thought you might know something	Ðeko mesusu be ɖewohĩ ènya nane
Maybe I’m the only one who isn’t surprised	Ðewohĩ nye ɖeka koe mewɔ nuku o
But he couldn’t do it.	Gake mete ŋu wɔe o.
Some of them work.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo wɔa dɔ.
I want you as much as you want me	Nye hã medi wò abe ale si nèdi nam ene
He can’t do it.	Mate ŋu awɔe o.
I didn’t have anything bad	Menye nu gbegblẽ aɖeke menɔ asinye o
This is just the first one.	Gbãtɔ koe nye esia.
That was his idea.	Emae nye eƒe susu.
I know a lot about you	Menya nu geɖe tso ŋuwò
But not necessarily in that order.	Gake menye le ɖoɖo ma nu kokoko o.
I knew there had to be something	Menya be ele be nane nanɔ anyi
I need to know if it’s there.	Ele be manya nenye be ele afima.
Be a moment.	Nye ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I, of course, played a part in this	Nye ya mewɔ akpa aɖe le esia me ya
And that’s pretty good.	Eye esia nyo ŋutɔ.
I don’t want to be there	Nyemedi be manɔ afima o
It was passionate, but it wasn’t a path.	Dzo nɔ eme, gake menye mɔ aɖee wònye o.
I felt so worthless though	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nyemele ɖeke me o ale gbegbe gake
Maybe none of us will get out of this.	Ðewohĩ mía dometɔ aɖeke mado le esia me o.
I was ready for something new	Menɔ klalo na nu yeye aɖe
But something is wrong here.	Gake nane gblẽ le afisia.
I was too old for this.	Metsi akpa na esia.
I can’t just stand here	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe afisia ko o
There seemed to be nothing here.	Edze abe naneke menɔ afisia o ene.
This book is no exception.	Agbalẽ sia hã mele eme o.
He couldn’t see anyone around him.	Mete ŋu kpɔ ame aɖeke le eŋu o.
He deserves that kind of guy.	Edze na ŋutsu ma ƒomevi.
I was talking to you about it, actually.	Menɔ nu ƒom na wò tso eŋu, le nyateƒe me.
I know you’re in it	Menya be èle eme
A few were actively working, or elsewhere	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ dɔ dzi vevie, alo nɔ teƒe bubu aɖe
You can rely on them.	Àte ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe wo ŋu.
I can’t escape that face	Nyemate ŋu asi le mo ma nu o

I have to get dressed	Ele be mado awu
And it may be true.	Eye ate ŋu anye nyateƒe.
It was a good thing for him .	Enye nu nyui aɖe nɛ .
I remember it well	Meɖo ŋku edzi nyuie
I’m the one who did that to you	Nyee nye ame si wɔ nu ma ɖe ŋuwò
That could be him.	Ema ate ŋu anye eya.
I didn’t mean to do it	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔe o
I just need to make time for it	Ðeko wòle be makpɔ ɣeyiɣi ɖe eŋu
I knew it wouldn’t work, it never did	Menya be mawɔ dɔ o, mewɔ dɔ kpɔ o
I set that up.	Meɖo ema ɖe edzi.
We can talk about this.	Míate ŋu aƒo nu tso nya sia ŋu.
I have to see you tonight	Ele nam be makpɔ wò le zã sia me
For that matter, mouth knows.	Le nya ma ta la, nu me nya nu.
He was the same, too.	Eya hã nɔ nenema ke.
I set a time limit	Meɖo ɣeyiɣi aɖe ɖi
I should have done this earlier	Ðe wòle be mawɔ esia do ŋgɔ hafi
This is not an exaggeration.	Esia menye nusi gbɔ eme o.
We are in a new era.	Míele ɣeyiɣi yeye aɖe me.
Part of me knew this was coming	Nye akpa aɖe nya be esia gbɔna
A man saw them there	Ŋutsu aɖe kpɔ wo le afima
Everything in it is true.	Nusianu si le eme la nye nyateƒe.
It’s just the opposite.	Nusi to vovo na ema koe wònye.
I think that might be good	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ema anyo
I'm not going to head though.	Nyemele ta yim o ke hã.
And it did happen, once.	Eye edzɔ nyateƒe, zi ɖeka.
I should have called him already	Ðe wòle be maƒo ka nɛ xoxo hafi
It is also a very simple situation.	Enye nɔnɔme si le bɔbɔe ŋutɔ hã.
I couldn’t form a reason	Nyemete ŋu wɔ susu aɖeke o
But I do have one thing	Gake nu ɖeka aɖe le asinye ya
I should not be treated that way	Mele be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋunye alea o
If anyone wants to join him, he will.	Ne ame aɖe di be yeawɔ ɖeka kplii la, awɔ ɖeka kplii.
I know you have a lot to offer.	Menya be nu geɖe le asiwò nàwɔ.
Everyone knows you’re there.	Amesiame nya be èle afima.
He was very clear about what needed to be done.	Nusi wòle be woawɔ la me kɔ nɛ ŋutɔ.
I only know the people who are still alive	Ame siwo gakpɔtɔ le agbe la koe menya
I didn’t see myself belonging there	Nyemekpɔ ɖokuinye be menye afima tɔ o
How can I do it.	Aleke mawɔe.
But only a part of it.	Gake akpa aɖe koe.
I’ve never seen anyone like that.	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke nenema kpɔ o.
That is clear to us.	Ema me kɔ na mí.
Which annoyed me a bit about.	Nusi do dziku nam vie le...
Part of it is still here	Eƒe akpa aɖe gakpɔtɔ le afisia
I know you are a very busy man.	Menya be ènye ŋutsu si ŋu vovo mele o ŋutɔ.
I'm already dressed	Medo awu xoxo
I would probably do them all	Anye be mawɔ wo katã
I can’t accept this	Nyemate ŋu axɔ esia o
What it is doesn’t matter.	Nukae wònye mehiã o.

That’s something, anyway.	Ema nye nane, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I doubt many of them stayed.	Meke ɖi be wo dometɔ geɖe tsi anyi.
And what’s in it? 	Eye nukae le eme?
It probably didn’t matter.	Anɔ eme be menɔ vevie o.
Keep that in mind.	Tsɔ nya ma de susu me na wò.
I settled down a bit with this	Meva nɔ anyi vie kple esia
No one had any money.	Ga aɖeke menɔ ame aɖeke si o.
A good name for them.	Ŋkɔ nyui aɖe na wo.
I suggest you do the same.	Meɖo aɖaŋu be nàwɔ nenema ke.
Anyone can say anything.	Ame sia ame ate ŋu agblɔ nya sia nya.
And he is on his way.	Eye ele eƒe mɔ dzi.
I am not going to waste this day	Nyemele ŋkeke sia gblẽ ge o
But I only have about an hour	Gake abe gaƒoƒo ɖeka koe le asinye
I would just like to do it.	Ðeko madi be mawɔe.
We can only remember them.	Ðeko míate ŋu aɖo ŋku wo dzi.
It was just amazing.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I have it, you have it, we all have it	Mele asinye, le asiwò, le mía katã si
This is certainly true in many cases.	Esia nye nyateƒe godoo le go geɖe me.
In time, however, this situation changed.	Gake le ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe la, nɔnɔme sia va trɔ.
And we hardly need to work on any of them.	Eye mehiã kura be míawɔ dɔ le wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋu o.
And that carried them through.	Eye ema tsɔ wo to eme.
But neither is very quick.	Gake wo dometɔ aɖeke mele kaba ŋutɔ o.
Within a week or two.	Le kwasiɖa ɖeka alo eve me.

It was a big challenge for me.	Enye kuxi gã aɖe nam.

It’s clever.	Edze aɖaŋu.
Like nothing he did mattered.	Abe naneke si wòwɔ la mele vevie o ene.
You have enough time.	Ɣeyiɣi si sɔ gbɔ le asiwò.

Everyone else and so will he.	Ame bubu ɖesiaɖe kple eya hã awɔe nenema.

It’s something.	Enye nane.
For myself, too.	Na nye ŋutɔ hã.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat.	Do dzo gã aɖe ɖe dzo si sɔ dzi.
I’m not sure about it.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o.
I just knew it was a very good role.	Ðeko menya be enye akpa nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
This road used to be home.	Mɔ sia nɔ aƒeme tsã.
As if he were somewhere else.	Abe ɖe wòle teƒe bubu aɖe ene.
He couldn’t hear anything.	Mete ŋu se naneke o.

You are now in a new situation.	Èle nɔnɔme yeye aɖe me fifia.
I just have a thing for her	Ðeko nane le asinye nɛ
He was just like that, too.	Eya hã nɔ nenema ko.
I don’t understand how we can do that.	Nyemese alesi míawɔ awɔ emae gɔme o.
I was expecting a word	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm na nya aɖe
I never knew a good person I didn’t know.	Nyemenya ame nyui aɖeke si menya o kpɔ o.
I didn’t have to tell him what was wrong.	Mehiã be magblɔ nusi gblẽ la nɛ o.
I am looking forward to that day.	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie na ŋkeke ma.
He worked hard for his money.	Ewɔ dɔ sesĩe ɖe eƒe ga ta.

This is simply not the case.	Ðeko esia mele alea o.

Nothing strange about that either.	Naneke mewɔ nuku le ema hã ŋu o.

This went on for years.	Esia yi edzi ƒe geɖe.

Everyone here knew about that.	Amesiame si nɔ afisia nya nu tso nya ma ŋu.
Look at where he is now.	Kpɔ afisi wòle fifia ɖa.
I don’t need to go into that here	Mehiã be mayi ema me le afisia o
It can eat someone.	Ate ŋu aɖu ame aɖe.

It doesn’t matter though.	Mehiã o ke hã.
The idea didn’t bother me.	Susu la meɖe fu nam o.

Not very much at least.	Menye nu geɖe ŋutɔ ya teti o.

But this doesn’t work.	Gake esia mewɔa dɔ o.
I couldn’t understand it	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme o
I want to go home and	Medi be mayi aƒeme eye
I can’t say that’s a good thing.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ be nu nyui aɖee nye ema o.

Check out what’s behind it.	Kpɔ nusi le megbe nɛ ɖa.
And now our turn.	Eye fifia míaƒe ɣeyiɣi.
There weren’t many cars.	Ʋu geɖe menɔ afima o.
I knew that was coming	Menya be ema gbɔna
Now, things are different.	Fifia, nuwo to vovo.
I have to do that every Saturday	Ele be mawɔ ema le Memleɖagbe ɖesiaɖe
It can be the same as in the market.	Ate ŋu anɔ abe alesi wòle le asi me ene.
He is not always borrowing money.	Menye ame si le ga dom ɣesiaɣi o.
I know you know what happened	Menya be ènya nu si dzɔ
Someone else answered him.	Ame bubu ɖo eŋu nɛ.
Something is wrong here.	Nane gblẽ le afisia.
Now we know the truth.	Fifia míenya nyateƒea.
I have never had this kind of problem	Kuxi sia ƒomevi meva dzinye kpɔ o
That’s all there is to it.	Eya koe nye ema.
Let me just try.	Mina mate kpɔ ko.
It doesn’t have to be that way.	Mehiã nenema o.

Let me know if this helps.	Na manya ne esia kpe ɖe ŋunye.

I believe in doing the work	Mexɔ dɔa wɔwɔ dzi se
He will talk to everyone.	Aƒo nu kple ame sia ame.
He can’t understand this.	Mate ŋu ase nya sia gɔme o.
But you have to have someone.	Gake ele be ame aɖe nanɔ asiwò.
I have to do this, or no one will	Ele be mawɔ esia, ne menye nenema o la, ame aɖeke mawɔe o
People are at home	Amewo le aƒeme

Grow up finally.	Tsi mlɔeba.

But he liked her.	Gake eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
That’s the desire to do things right.	Emae nye didi be woawɔ nuwo nyuie.
I’ve never seen anything like it	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o
There is room for everyone and everyone on their behalf	Teƒe na amesiame kple amesiame le wo teƒe
But it is not impossible.	Gake menye nusi mate ŋu adzɔ o.
Close to the market.	Te ɖe asi ŋu.
I didn’t know what to say or do	Nyemenya nya si magblɔ alo awɔ o
With an open mind and an open heart.	Le susu si ʋu kple dzi si ʋu me.
When he's in school, it's like he's living two lives.	Ne ele suku la, ele abe ɖe wòle agbe eve me ene.
I am definitely going backwards	Mele megbe yim godoo
There is so much in it.	Nu geɖe ŋutɔ le eme.
I have a lot to live up to.	Nu geɖe le asinye manɔ agbe ɖe enu.
And his character isn’t exactly flawless.	Eye eƒe nɔnɔme menye vodada aɖeke tututu o.
I couldn’t remember his face at all	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku eƒe mo dzi kura o
That was pretty easy.	Ema nɔ bɔbɔe ŋutɔ.
I can’t take it away from you or anything	Nyemate ŋu aɖee le asiwò alo naneke me o
It’s a very complicated thing	Enye nusi me kɔ ŋutɔ
I couldn’t quite figure out what he was doing	Nyemete ŋu nya nu si wɔm wònɔ la tututu o
Perhaps he will say something.	Ðewohĩ agblɔ nya aɖewo.
I couldn’t be this fascinated	Nyemate ŋu anye nusi ƒe nu lé dzi nam alea o
I can’t stand to be here anymore	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi anɔ afisia azɔ o
I do know where they are now.	Menya afisi wole fifia ya.

There was only one foot between them.	Afɔ ɖeka koe nɔ wo dome.
This helped me a lot.	Esia kpe ɖe ŋunye ŋutɔ.
It was too soon, too soon.	Ewɔ kaba akpa, ewɔ kaba akpa.
I will definitely try this.	Mate esia kpɔ godoo.
I think it will be very useful for us	Mesusu be aɖe vi na mí ŋutɔ
At least a long night in it.	Zã didi aɖe ya teti le eme.

I would be letting it go.	Anye be maɖe asi le eŋu.
I doubt he will remember	Meke ɖi be aɖo ŋku edzi
Hold on a little bit.	Lé ɖe asi vie.
But what was behind them was different.	Gake nusi nɔ megbe na wo la to vovo.
I really enjoyed the job I had	Dɔ si nɔ asinye la do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ
It will be waiting for you.	Anɔ lalam na wò.

I wonder how they are doing that	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be aleke wole ema wɔm hã
I felt the wind stop.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ya la tɔ.
I tried several times with the same result	Mete kpɔ zi geɖe eye nu ɖeka ma ke do tso eme
There was no help for him.	Kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke menɔ anyi ɖe eŋu o.
Not one of them.	Menye ɖeka o.
I cannot speak for everyone.	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu ɖe ​​amewo katã ta o.

Either one will work.	Wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe awɔ dɔ.
That pleased him.	Ema dze eŋu.
I know it couldn’t have been easy.	Menya be mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe hafi o.
I needed to find a new job	Ehiã be makpɔ dɔ yeye aɖe
He wasn’t interested in much else at that point.	Metsɔ ɖeke le nu bubu geɖe me le ɣeyiɣi ma me o.
That’s what this is.	Emae nye nusi esia nye.
I can’t remember what day it was	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku ŋkeke si dzi wònye dzi o
He had never seen them himself.	Eya ŋutɔ mekpɔ wo kpɔ kura o.
I can’t stand it anymore.	Nyemate ŋu ado dzi azɔ o.
I was hoping everything would be fine	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be nusianu anyo
My rational mind knows it’s true.	Nye susu si me susu le nya be enye nyateƒe.
I doubted everyone and everything	Meke ɖi amesiame kple nusianu
I've been in it long enough to know if it's not worth it.	Mele eme ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ale gbegbe be manya ne meɖe vi aɖeke o.
How can I do that .	Aleke mawɔ awɔ ema .
I think in parts they like that challenge.	Mesusu be le akpa aɖewo me la, kuxi ma dzɔa dzi na wo.
I was so angry with everyone	Medo dziku ɖe amesiame ŋu ale gbegbe
Independent.	Le eɖokui si.
Many are looking for easy money.	Ame geɖe le ga si le bɔbɔe dim.
It just depended on it.	Ðeko wònɔ te ɖe edzi.
Two things have come out of this.	Nu eve do tso esia me.
I know too much.	Menya nu geɖe akpa.
He probably won’t.	Ðewohĩ mawɔe nenema o.
I was in a different phase of my life	Menɔ nye agbe ƒe akpa bubu aɖe me
These people have no rules, no rules.	Se aɖeke mele ame siawo si o, se aɖeke mele wo si o.
I really enjoyed this part	Akpa sia do dzidzɔ nam ŋutɔ nyateƒe
Or the opposite of that.	Alo nusi to vovo na ema.
I needed his attention	Mehiã eƒe susu
I was nervous for the first time too	Nye hã metsi dzodzodzoe zi gbãtɔ
I’m committed to you	Metsɔ ɖokuinye na wò
I know what’s in it.	Menya nusi le eme.
I had a lot on my mind	Nu geɖe nɔ susu me nam
He’s not the only one like her.	Menye eya ɖeka koe le abe eya ene o.
Or here, another.	Alo afisia, bubu.
But one, it’s a small place.	Gake ɖeka, enye teƒe sue aɖe.
He’s sick.	Edze dɔ.
I stepped forward to join him.	Meɖe afɔ ɖe go be mawɔ ɖeka kplii.
The last word.	Nya mamlɛtɔ.
There is rarely much money involved.	Ƒã hafi ga geɖe nɔa eme.
We don’t know what it was like.	Míenya alesi wònɔ o.
I should have just let you go	Ðeko wòle be maɖe asi le ŋuwò hafi
It is the most beautiful thing.	Enye nu si nya kpɔ wu.
I think it’s just his mouth	Mesusu be eƒe nu koe wònye
First one in, no problem.	Gbãtɔ ɖeka le, kuxi aɖeke meli o.
I think there could be some great moments tonight.	Mesusu be ɣeyiɣi gã aɖewo ate ŋu anɔ anyi le zã sia me.
It’s like a fire.	Ele abe dzo ene.
I'll tell you something	Magblɔ nya aɖe na wò
I have absolutely no problem with that.	Kuxi aɖeke mele ŋunye kura le ema ŋu o.
I can’t fight that at all.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ avu kple nya ma kura o.
And I’m like, too.	Eye nye hã mele abe.
I have to do this.	Ele be mawɔ esia.
I think he always had that idea.	Mesusu be susu ma nɔa eŋu ɣesiaɣi.
I can’t talk to you right now	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu kpli wò fifia o
He hardly recognized his own voice.	Mekpɔ eya ŋutɔ ƒe gbe dze sii kura o.
I might want to do it	Ðewohĩ madi be mawɔe
That hole hasn’t appeared yet.	Do ma medze haɖe o.
I know why you did what you did today	Menya nusita nèwɔ nu si nèwɔ egbea
I told him that was impossible	Megblɔ nɛ be ema manya wɔ o
It’s a good plan.	Enye ɖoɖo nyui aɖe.
I am not going to surrender	Nyemele ɖokuinye tsɔ ge de asi na ame o
Not well, anyway.	Menye nyuie o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
There was something odd about him.	Nane si mewɔ nuku o nɔ eŋu.
He needs food.	Ehiã nuɖuɖu.
They had a good life.	Agbe nyui nɔ wo si.
I would be very, very happy.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ ŋutɔ.
I really wanted to do that	Medi vevie be mawɔ ema
I think he will do very well in it	Mesusu be awɔe nyuie ŋutɔ le eme
I really had to step up	Ele be maɖe afɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ
I felt that was why he was looking at me.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ema tae wònɔ nye kpɔm ɖo.
I just can’t get this right	Ðeko nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia nyuie o
And it used to be that way.	Eye wònɔ nenema tsã hã.
Make room in his head for.	Ðe teƒe aɖe le eƒe ta me na.
I was just looking for something to do	Ðeko menɔ nane dim be mawɔ
I have to do things my way	Ele be mawɔ nuwo le nye mɔ nu
I felt grown up.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be metsi.
I put myself down.	Metsɔ ɖokuinye da ɖe anyi.
I will explain what this means in this post.	Maɖe nusi esia fia me le nya sia me.
A bullet somehow got into the room	Tu aɖe ge ɖe xɔa me le mɔ aɖe nu
Yet it won’t come.	Ke hã mava o.
We must act on it.	Ele be míawɔ nu ɖe ​​eŋu.
You are ready to go home.	Èle klalo be yeayi aƒeme.
I shouldn’t have rushed you	Mele be mawɔ kaba na wò hafi o
He seemed satisfied.	Edze abe eƒe dzi dze eme ene.
I had an amazing year	Ƒe aɖe si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ la nɔ asinye
An error occurred.	Vodada aɖe dzɔ.
He has everything.	Nusianu le esi.
Leave a room.	Gblẽ xɔ aɖe ɖi.
I just know who you are	Ðeko menya amesi nènye
Part of me knew this was coming	Nye akpa aɖe nya be esia gbɔna
Do what you have to do.	Wɔ nusi wòle be nàwɔ.
But not impossible at all.	Gake menye esi mate ŋu adzɔ o kura o.
Doesn't seem like much, does it.	Medze abe nu geɖe ene o, ɖe wòle nenema.
Not in my town.	Menye le nye du me o.
Like buying food.	Abe nuɖuɖu ƒle ene.
There are a couple of legs in each section	Afɔ eve aɖewo le akpa ɖesiaɖe me
I just wanted to talk to you	Ðeko medi be maƒo nu kpli wò
There was a lot of blood.	Ʋu sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
No food, no water, no heart.	Nuɖuɖu aɖeke meli o, tsi aɖeke meli o, dzi aɖeke meli o.
Long life.	Agbe didi.
You and him.	Wò kple eya.
Anyone have any idea?.	Ame aɖe si susu aɖe le?.
I have your attention	Wò susu le asinye
But no one really knows much about it.	Gake ame aɖeke menya nu geɖe tso eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
Turn to them quickly.	Trɔ ɖe wo ŋu kaba.
I just sat there	Ðeko menɔ anyi ɖe afima
And it worked well.	Eye ewɔ dɔ nyuie.
I really hope you can do it	Mele mɔ kpɔm ŋutɔŋutɔ be àte ŋu awɔe
Do something else.	Wɔ nu bubu aɖe.
I don’t have anything.	Naneke mele asinye o.
I had to come and give you this	Ele nam be mava tsɔ esia na wò
Nothing will ever come out.	Naneke mado go gbeɖe o.
I think you can find a lot of books about it	Mesusu be àte ŋu akpɔ agbalẽ geɖe tso eŋu
I just had to get my head together.	Ðeko wòle be maƒo nye ta nu ƒu.
We can handle this, no problem.	Míate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ, kuxi aɖeke meli o.
I will tell him what happened	Magblɔ nu si dzɔ la nɛ
It was very impressive	Ewɔ dɔ ɖe edzi ŋutɔ
I only found out a week ago	Kwasiɖa ɖeka koe nye esia meva nya
A perfect summer meal	Dzomeŋɔli nuɖuɖu si sɔ nyuie
I expected nothing more from them	Nyemekpɔ mɔ na naneke wu ema tso wo gbɔ o
But hopefully it will help.	Gake míele mɔ kpɔm be akpe ɖe ame ŋu.
I touched his face with my hand	Metsɔ nye asi ka asi eƒe mo ŋu
A little too small.	Susu sue aɖe akpa vie.
Go through them now.	To wo me fifia.
Take a look at this.	Kpɔ nya sia ɖa.
He didn’t tell the truth either.	Megblɔ nyateƒea hã o.
It might take four days.	Ðewohĩ axɔ ŋkeke ene.
I gave up everything	Meɖe asi le nusianu ŋu
I don’t know what he did.	Nyemenya nusi wòwɔ o.
I am looking forward to that.	Mele mɔ kpɔm na ema vevie.
I still have that.	Ema gakpɔtɔ le asinye.
And of course, this is by design.	Eye le nyateƒe me la, esia to ɖoɖo nu.
Try a little bit.	Te kpɔ vie.
It's just too small.	Ðeko wòle sue akpa.
His face fell down.	Eƒe mo dze anyi.
I had no idea what was going on until much later	Nyemenya nusi nɔ edzi yim o vaseɖe esime ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe megbe
This may well be the case.	Esia ate ŋu anɔ alea ŋutɔ.
But we can always handle more.	Gake míate ŋu akpɔ nu geɖe gbɔ ɣesiaɣi.
It can be done in a day.	Ate ŋu awɔ le ŋkeke ɖeka me.
I put my name on it.	Metsɔ nye ŋkɔ de edzi.
Maybe he can find one more.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu akpɔ ɖeka bubu.
I was the one who found it in our room	Nyee nye amesi ke ɖe eŋu le míaƒe xɔ me
It was too quick.	Ewɔ kaba akpa.
There is a market for everything.	Asi aɖe li na nusianu.
I know a lot of people do this.	Menya be ame geɖe wɔa esia.
I think he would have liked them all	Mesusu be anye ne wo katã adzɔ dzi nɛ hafi
That’s more money for us.	Ema nye ga geɖe wu na mí.
And it doesn’t seem like it can either.	Eye medze abe ɖe mate ŋui hã o ene.
I had never felt anything like that	Nyemese naneke le ɖokuinye me nenema kpɔ o
At that point in time.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma me.
That’s the problem with you.	Emae nye kuxi si le ŋuwò.
Your blood child	Wò ʋu ƒe vi
There is no last name.	Ŋkɔ mamlɛtɔ aɖeke meli o.
He had a point.	Nya aɖe nɔ esi.
I was hoping he would.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be awɔe nenema.
He had very little time.	Ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe nɔ esi.
I couldn’t get through it	Nyemete ŋu to eme o
It will do you a lot of good.	Awɔ nyui geɖe na wò.
This simply does not exist.	Ðeko esia meli o.
I just have it.	Ðeko wòle asinye.
I want that as much as you do	Nye hã medi ema abe wò ke ene
That will end today.	Ema awu enu egbea.
You haven’t missed anything so far.	Naneke meli si to ŋuwò vaseɖe fifia o.
I have many good ideas, but nothing works.	Susu nyui geɖe le asinye, gake naneke medze edzi o.
Some rooms may be small.	Xɔ aɖewo ate ŋu anɔ sue.
I was falling behind in our meeting	Menɔ megbe yim le míaƒe kpekpea me
In a way that helped me.	Le mɔ aɖe si kpe ɖe ŋunye nu.
You have something in mind.	Nane le susu me na wò.
This city looked completely different hours later.	Du sia to vovo kura le gaƒoƒo geɖe megbe.
I was depressed	Nu te ɖe dzinye
But he cannot see these two things.	Gake mate ŋu akpɔ nu eve siawo o.
I actually didn’t like him	Le nyateƒe me la, eƒe nu medze ŋunye o
Not sure how long this will take	Nyemeka ɖe ɣeyiɣi didi si esia axɔ dzi o
He couldn’t think of any.	Mete ŋu bu ɖeke ŋu o.
He will talk to you.	Aƒo nu kpli wò.
I can’t see how doing more would help.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ alesi nu geɖe wɔwɔ akpe ɖe ŋunye o.
I think he was doing that.	Mesusu be nu ma wɔm wònɔ.
He was a very strong man.	Enye ŋutsu sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
I’m glad I did.	Edzɔ dzi nam be mewɔe.
I want my own thing, this thing.	Medi nye ŋutɔ nye nya, nya sia.
I was able to live a simple life	Mete ŋu nɔa agbe bɔbɔe
He’s probably never been here.	Anɔ eme be meva afisia kpɔ o.
I resigned myself to it	Meɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu ɖe eŋu
It may last for a while.	Ate ŋu anɔ anyi ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
I wasn’t going backwards	Menye ɖe menɔ megbe yim o
I understand these things	Mese nu siawo gɔme
I hope this post helps you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be nya sia akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I don’t know anything, really	Nyemenya naneke o, le nyateƒe me
I’ve tried it before.	Medze agbagba kpɔ.
His hair is also unreal.	Eƒe ɖa hã menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o.
I know what you’re about to say	Menya nya si gblɔ ge nèle
I would have said it was impossible	Anye ne magblɔ be manya wɔ o
In some cases, that issue will already exist.	Le go aɖewo me la, nya ma anɔ anyi xoxo.
It will be like in the mouth.	Anɔ abe ɖe wòle nu me ene.
I don’t want to let go	Nyemedi be maɖe asi le eŋu o
I am making this work.	Mele esia wɔm be wòawɔ dɔ.
He won’t be at home.	Manɔ aƒeme o.
That doesn’t matter much anyway.	Ema mehiã boo aɖeke le mɔ sia mɔ nu o.
I just can’t do it	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔe o
I think it’s an incredible help for you	Mesusu be enye kpekpeɖeŋu si mexɔ se o na wò
He doesn’t seem to trust me too much.	Edze abe meka ɖe dzinye akpa o ene.
I just really like them	Ðeko wo dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
A few raised their hands	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo do asi ɖe dzi
He might be there.	Ðewohĩ anɔ afima.
I was doing this for them	Menɔ esia wɔm na wo
My mind overpowered my heart.	Nye susu ɖu nye dzi dzi.
It doesn’t work that way.	Mewɔa dɔ nenema o.
I can’t talk to him at all	Nyemate ŋu aƒo nu kplii kura o
There is something else.	Nu bubu aɖe hã li.
I can’t do anything else.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu bubu aɖeke o.
I just can’t get it right yet	Ðeko nyemete ŋu se egɔme nyuie haɖe o
I’ve seen you.	Mekpɔ wò.
I did something right.	Mewɔ nane nyuie.
I am not sure at all	Nyemeka ɖe edzi kura kura o
I couldn’t be more clear about that.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma me kɔ wu ema o.
I have never been so happy	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ nenema gbegbe kpɔ o
That’s a good thing.	Nu nyui aɖee nye ema.
That’s a problem for exactly the same reason.	Ema hã nye kuxi le susu ma ke tututu ta.
I look exactly like him	Medze abe eya tututu ene
A little about us.	Mía ŋu nya vi aɖe.
He was very satisfied.	Eƒe dzi dze eme ŋutɔ.
They are among us.	Wole mía dome.
No one can do anything.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ naneke o.
I explained my side to them.	Meɖe nye akpa dzi na wo.
Everyone ran together.	Amesiame ƒu du ɖekae.
But that could just be me.	Gake nye koe ema ate ŋu anye.
Decide what is most important to you.	Tso nya me le nusi le vevie na wò wu ŋu.
I need everybody there	Mehiã amesiame le afima
I know some people.	Menya ame aɖewo.
Like the last one.	Abe mamlɛtɔ ene.
I made a big mistake	Mewɔ vodada gã aɖe
They are looking for help.	Wole kpekpeɖeŋu dim.
I wish he had someone like him	Medi be ame aɖe nanɔ esi abe eya ene
It can’t happen here.	Mate ŋu adzɔ le afisia o.
I was trying to do you a favor	Menɔ agbagba dzem be mawɔ nu nyui aɖe na wò
A simple matter, really.	Nya bɔbɔe aɖe, le nyateƒe me.
I have very little time.	Ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe le asinye.
At the same time, something hit him.	Le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me la, nane ƒo to eŋu.
I have a week to live	Kwasiɖa ɖeka le asinye manɔ agbe
This month we’re doing something a little different.	Ɣleti sia me la, míele nane si to vovo vie wɔm.
I don’t want to do anything more.	Nyemedi be mawɔ naneke wu ema o.
He's on to some good stuff.	Ele nu nyui aɖewo dzi.
It’s fantastic in every way.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ le go sia go me.
I could never put them together like he could	Nyemate ŋu aƒo wo nu ƒu abe alesi wòate ŋui ene gbeɖe o
It makes total sense to me.	Susu le eme kura nam.
I think this is all a big mistake	Mesusu be esia katã nye vodada gã aɖe
I refused to have anything	Megbe be naneke manɔ asinye o
There are some similarities between that and ours.	Nu aɖewo ɖi wo nɔewo le nya ma kple mía tɔ dome.
I was too quick with them	Mewɔ kaba akpa le wo ŋu
I'm talking about.	Mele nu ƒom tso.
That’s pretty much it, too.	Ema hã sɔ gbɔ ŋutɔ.
Keep it up.	Yi edzi nenema.
You certainly can’t do that.	Màte ŋu awɔ ema o godoo.
I did reject that.	Megbe nya ma nyateƒe.
I still don’t know what type of type it is.	Nyemenya nusi ƒomevi ƒomevi wònye haɖe o.
I don’t have to manage it	Mehiã be makpɔ edzi o
I couldn’t find anything from previous years	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nu aɖeke tso ƒe siwo va yi me o
I don’t have to go.	Mehiã be mayi o.
I really don’t know who else to call	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya ame bubu si maƒo ka na o
I need this more than anything	Mehiã esia wu nusianu
Tell the truth.	Gblɔ nyateƒea.
Open your hair.	Ʋu wò ɖa.
The following are possible scenarios.	Nu siwo gbɔna la ate ŋu adzɔ.
Maybe I should find someone else to talk to	Ðewohĩ ele be madi ame bubu aɖe si maƒo nu kplii
Not the other way around.	Menye mɔ bubu nu o.
It really worked.	Ewɔ dɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I will need to know more	Ahiã be manya nu geɖe wu
That was a difficult time for us.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe na mí.
I just needed something to keep me going	Ðeko mehiã nane si ana mayi edzi anɔ dɔ wɔm
But here there is none.	Gake le afisia la, ɖeke meli o.
There was also no blood in the vehicle.	Ʋu aɖeke hã menɔ ʋua me o.
I liked him a lot too	Nye hã eƒe nu lé dzi nam ŋutɔ
We live, in part, because of you.	Míele agbe, le akpa aɖe me, le wò ta.
In every way possible.	Le mɔ ɖesiaɖe nu.
I don’t want anything to do with them	Nyemedi be mawɔ naneke le wo ŋu o
I would be very happy.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
And today the ‘if only’ has come true.	Eye egbea ‘ne edzɔ be’ la va eme.
Some things may take longer.	Nu aɖewo ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi wu.
It is a complete lie.	Enye alakpa kura.
He was now at peace.	Eƒe dzi dze eme azɔ.
I also know that my food is expensive	Menya hã be nye nuɖuɖu xɔ asi
You know everyone.	Ènya amesiame.
No one cares what no one knows.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le nusi ame aɖeke menya o me o.
I will see you here very soon	Makpɔ wò le afisia kpuie ŋutɔ
I can call someone	Mate ŋu aƒo ka na ame aɖe
That’s over.	Ema wu enu.
I was in a tough spot	Menɔ teƒe sesẽ aɖe
I don’t want to deal with tomorrow	Nyemedi be mawɔ nu kple etsɔ o
In fact, the opposite is true.	Le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae.
The opposite, if anything.	Nusi to vovo na ema, ne nane li.
It’s really important that I figure this out.	Ele vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ be makpɔ esia gbɔ.
I may most likely be the latter	Ðewohĩ anɔ eme godoo be nyee nye mamlɛtɔ
It was just incredible.	Nu si mexɔ se o koe wònye.
It certainly won’t come	Mava godoo o
But I had no desire to do so	Gake didi aɖeke menɔ menye be mawɔe nenema o
We don’t have much time.	Ɣeyiɣi boo aɖeke mele mía si o.
No big problems or overly complicated issues.	Kuxi gã alo nya sesẽ siwo gbɔ eme aɖeke meli o.
I am trying to find them	Mele agbagba dzem be madi wo
I have heard a lot about you	Mese nu geɖe tso ŋuwò
The whole city was under water.	Tsi nɔ du bliboa te.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I wanted to get out of there	Medi be mado le afima
I don’t know how to protect them.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔ akpɔ wo ta o.
Now this is interesting.	Fifia esia doa dzidzɔ na ame.
Now, listen to me carefully.	Azɔ, ɖo tom nyuie.
Or for himself.	Alo na eya ŋutɔ.

Opportunity lay ahead of him.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ nɔ ŋgɔ nɛ.
Please please more than that.	Taflatse taflatse geɖe wu ema.
It’s not surprising.	Mewɔ nuku o.

It was just so wonderful.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku alea gbegbe.
There is no other way.	Mɔ bubu aɖeke meli o.
Each stage is different.	Akpa ɖesiaɖe to vovo.

I have a good thing about you	Nu nyui aɖe le asinye le ŋuwò

I couldn’t remember what happened after that	Nyemete ŋu ɖo ŋku nusi dzɔ le ema megbe dzi o
Yet.	Haɖe o.
He is with us.	Ele mía gbɔ.
I have a small house there	Aƒe sue aɖe le asinye le afima
I know exactly who he is	Menya amesi tututu wònye
I saw you talking.	Mekpɔ wò nèle nu ƒom.
I felt that I was being treated very well	Mese le ɖokuinye me be mewɔa nu ɖe ​​dzinye ŋutɔ
I wanted to tell him the truth	Medi be magblɔ nyateƒea nɛ
He can only say something about the outcome.	Ðeko wòate ŋu agblɔ nya aɖe tso nusi ado tso eme ŋu.
There were a few reasons for this.	Susu ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ esia ta.
You don’t know what it’s like to not have one.	Mènya alesi wòle be ɖeke mele asiwò o.
It might be really bad.	Ðewohĩ anye nu gbegblẽ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I apologized to him.	Meɖe kuku nɛ.

We can’t talk about tomorrow.	Míate ŋu agblɔ nu tso etsɔ ŋu o.
No one cares about anything.	Ame aɖeke metsɔ ɖeke le naneke me o.
There was no one anywhere.	Ame aɖeke menɔ afi aɖeke o.
I just can’t do this for you right now	Ðeko nyemate ŋu awɔ esia na wò fifia o
He was such a nice person.	Ame nyui aɖee wònye nenema gbegbe.
I reserve the right to contact you regarding this matter	Mekpɔ mɔ aƒo ka na wò ku ɖe nya sia ŋu
Come on, lift up.	Va, kɔ ɖe dzi.
Everything is in it.	Nusianu le eme.

I only had to deal with him once or twice	Zi ɖeka alo zi eve koe wòle be mawɔ nu kplii
It’s a challenge for these kids.	Enye kuxi na ɖevi siawo.
Some missed this year, a lot last year.	Ame aɖewo to ƒe sia me, nu geɖe to eme le ƒe si va yi me.
This is probably that.	Esia anya nye ema.
I know nothing about myself	Nyemenya naneke tso ɖokuinye ŋu o
This works well for me.	Esia wɔa dɔ nam nyuie.
That seems very likely.	Edze abe ema ate ŋu adzɔ ŋutɔ ene.
Just doing this over and over again.	Esia wɔwɔ zi gbɔ zi geɖe ko.

Which is, is.	Nusi nye, nye.
I think this will work	Mesusu be esia awɔ dɔ
I told you it was too easy	Megblɔ na mi be ele bɔbɔe akpa
No one will ever know.	Ame aɖeke manya gbeɖe o.
His neck shot back and his voice was harsh.	Eƒe kɔ da tu ɖe megbe eye eƒe gbe sesẽ.
However, that is not true at all.	Ke hã, nya ma menye nyateƒe kura o.
We had almost nothing.	Naneke menɔ mía si kloe o.
He was a very strange man.	Enye ŋutsu aɖe si mewɔ nuku kura o.
And they are planning it .	Eye wole ɖoɖo wɔm ɖe eŋu .
I did that all by myself	Nye ɖeka koe wɔ ema katã
Finally, something hit him.	Mlɔeba la, nane va dze edzi.

You can imagine what he was doing.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nu si wɔm wònɔ la le susu me.
I couldn’t figure out where it was	Nyemete ŋu nya afi si wòle o
He didn’t ask any questions.	Mebia nya aɖeke o.
I have been here for a month.	Ɣleti ɖekae nye esia mele afisia.
I would have endured everything	Anye ne medo dzi le nusianu me hafi
Maybe something a little more interesting can help.	Ðewohĩ nane si ado dzidzɔ na ame vie ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I didn’t hear you come out	Nyemese wò va do o
It’s a very nice job.	Dɔ aɖe ŋutɔ.

He seemed unable to speak.	Edze abe mete ŋu ƒoa nu o ene.

I had already tried this, long before	Mete esia kpɔ xoxo, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe do ŋgɔ
But it’s also because of him.	Gake eya hã tae wòle.
I apologize for that	Meɖe kuku ɖe nya ma ta
Otherwise, a good idea.	Ne menye nenema o la, susu nyui aɖee.
Come on, we have work to do.	Va, dɔ le mía si míawɔ.

This goes beyond weird.	Esia yi ŋgɔ wu nusi mewɔ nuku o.
There was a part of me there	Nye akpa aɖe nɔ afima
It is a leg .	Enye afɔ aɖe .
It didn’t fit me well either.	Medze nam hã nyuie o.

Which can be helpful.	Nusi ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu.

I don’t know if any of them will work.	Nyemenya nenye be wo dometɔ aɖe awɔ dɔ o.
I don’t want to go.	Nyemedi be mayi o.
I never felt that way about anyone else	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema le ame bubu aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o

I wondered if they might be talking to each other	Mebia ɖokuinye be ɖewohĩ wole nu ƒom na wo nɔewo hã
A house that someone can actually take care of	Aƒe si me ame aɖe ate ŋu akpɔ edzi le ŋutɔŋutɔ

Think about what we can do together.	Bu nu siwo míate ŋu awɔ ɖekae ŋu kpɔ.

I’ve heard them before.	Mese wo kpɔ.
I can do this, no problem	Mate ŋu awɔ esia, kuxi aɖeke meli o
I felt like he was there.	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ɖe wòle afima ene.

This is all I have	Esia koe le asinye
But this is pretty close.	Gake esia te ɖe eŋu ŋutɔ.
This came as a surprise to me as well.	Esia va wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ hã.
Only, his reputation goes much further.	Ðeko, ŋkɔ nyui si le eŋu la yi ŋgɔ wu ema kura.
I may know a few names	Ðewohĩ menya ŋkɔ ʋɛ aɖewo
I wonder what happened to him	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae dzɔ ɖe edzi hã
He couldn't quite say that.	Mete ŋu gblɔ nya ma tututu o.

I was shocked by that, shocked	Mewɔ nuku nam le nya ma ta, ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
He was a morning person.	Enye ŋdi me ame aɖe.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɣeyiɣi ƒe nya koe wònye.

Thank you so much for that.	Akpe geɖe na mi ɖe ema ta.

I can never get this last part right.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ akpa mamlɛtɔ sia nyuie gbeɖe o.

Everything is right	Nusianu sɔ
I couldn’t let myself go there	Nyemete ŋu ɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu be mayi afima o

Put your hand behind your head.	Da wò asi ɖe wò ta megbe.
In this case, it is not.	Le go sia me la, mele nenema o.

He was the only one who died once.	Eya koe ku zi ɖeka.

No one could see anything.	Ame aɖeke mete ŋu kpɔ naneke o.
I felt like he could see right through me	Mese le ɖokuinye me abe ɖe wòate ŋu akpɔ nu to menye tututu ene
That’s really good.	Ema nyo ŋutɔŋutɔ.
He just didn’t want me to be under the gun	Ðeko medi be manɔ tu la te o
A car hit me.	Ʋu aɖe ƒo ɖe ŋunye.
And a good thing, too.	Eye nu nyui aɖe hã.
He was very clever.	Edze aɖaŋu ŋutɔ.
They should be treated the same.	Ele be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu nenema ke.
So we can benefit each other.	Eya ta míate ŋu aɖe vi na mía nɔewo.

No one can work with such a complicated system.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ dɔ kple ɖoɖo si sesẽ nenema gbegbe o.
If he could not do good, he would do nothing.	Ne mate ŋu awɔ nyui o la, anye ne mawɔ naneke o.

Hours passed before we knew it.	Gaƒoƒo geɖe va yi hafi míenya.
There is money there.	Ga le afima.

It really doesn’t matter.	Le nyateƒe me la, mehiã o.
I would like something similar, but way easier	Madi nane si sɔ kple esia, gake mɔ si le bɔbɔe wu
I can’t remember anything.	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋku naneke dzi o.
I just wish everything else was that simple	Ðeko medi be nu bubu ɖesiaɖe nanɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe

Otherwise, he would not have done so.	Ne ɖe mele nenema o la, anye ne mewɔe nenema o.
But this year is different.	Gake ƒe sia ya to vovo.

Back to reality.	Trɔ yi nu ŋutɔŋutɔ gbɔ.
Tomorrow will be much easier.	Etsɔ anɔ bɔbɔe wu kura.
That’s the whole idea.	Emae nye susu bliboa.

There was something else going on.	Nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ edzi yim.

I didn’t expect anyone to come home	Nyemekpɔ mɔ be ame aɖeke ava aƒeme o
That was a different time in my life.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi si to vovo le nye agbe me.

You couldn’t find a better man.	Màte ŋu akpɔ ŋutsu aɖe si nyo wu ema o.

To deal with them.	Be woawɔ nu ɖe ​​wo ŋu.

A big deal for me.	Nu gã aɖe nam.

On the other hand.	Le go bubu me la.
That’s what they’re there for.	Ema tae wole afima ɖo.
I can’t figure out what he did with it	Nyemate ŋu anya nu si wòwɔ kplii o
I never wanted to be in that place	Nyemedi gbeɖe be manɔ teƒe ma o
I wonder how many of them are already dead	Mebia ɖokuinye be wo dometɔ nenie ku xoxo hã
But at any given moment he will.	Gake le ɣeyiɣi ɖesiaɖe me la, awɔe nenema.
Make herself at home.	Wɔ eɖokui le aƒeme.
It could have been after that.	Ate ŋu anye le ema megbe hafi.
But he didn’t ask that question.	Gake mebia nya ma o.

In fact, there will only be one.	Le nyateƒe me la, ame ɖeka koe anɔ anyi.
I knew it would need a day or two	Menya be ahiã ŋkeke ɖeka alo eve
He will definitely come.	Ava godoo.
And how it is today.	Eye alesi wòle egbea hã.
If he doesn’t.	Ne mewɔe o la.

So far, it hasn’t.	Vaseɖe fifia la, mewɔe nenema o.

He had a lot of issues.	Nya geɖe nɔ eŋu.

There’s something in your face.	Nane le mo na wò.
But now his heart has changed.	Gake fifia la, eƒe dzi trɔ.

That will cost money.	Ema axɔ ga.
We cannot live in the past.	Míate ŋu anɔ agbe le ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me o.
For an hour or so.	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka alo esi wu nenema.

What is going on?.	Nukae le edzi yim?.
I missed that a little bit.	Ema to ŋunye vie.
I’m not the only one	Menye nye ɖeka koe o
I don’t know who these people are	Nyemenya ame siwo ame siawo nye o
I know what happened inside	Menya nusi dzɔ le eme
I don’t like these people.	Ame siawo medze ŋunye o.
It’s like a law or something.	Ele abe se alo nane ene.
I don’t know how people can stay like that.	Nyemenya alesi amewo ate ŋu anɔ anyi nenema o.

But that is not the case today.	Gake mele alea egbea o.

I was always worried about him	Metsi dzi ɖe eŋu ɣesiaɣi
Or else he would sit and play them.	Alo ne menye nenema o la, anɔ anyi aƒo wo.
He couldn’t go on like that.	Mete ŋu yi edzi nenema o.
I feel like he's in a state right now	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ele nɔnɔme aɖe me fifia

A simpler time.	Ɣeyiɣi si le bɔbɔe wu.

Everyone had a job, and everyone was important.	Dɔ aɖe nɔ amesiame si, eye amesiame nɔ vevie.
I decided to just tell them the truth	Meɖoe be magblɔ nyateƒea na wo ko
I’m here to meet people.	Meva afisia be mado go amewo.
But it was everything.	Gake enye nusianu.
This place opened my eyes to that.	Teƒe sia ʋu ŋku nam ɖe ema ŋu.
And this is still true.	Eye esia gakpɔtɔ nye nyateƒe.

Maybe he didn’t either.	Ðewohĩ eya hã mewɔe nenema o.
If so, where.	Ne ele nenema la, afikae.
I lived through a few	Menɔ agbe to ʋɛ aɖewo me
It didn’t last long.	Menɔ anyi didi o.

But you can find them anywhere.	Gake àte ŋu ake ɖe wo ŋu le afi sia afi.

I didn’t want any help.	Nyemedi kpekpeɖeŋu aɖeke o.

I hope it comes true.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be ava eme.
This is good money.	Esia nye ga nyui aɖe.

He didn’t ask any questions.	Mebia nya aɖeke o.
This shouldn’t be surprising either.	Mele be esia hã nawɔ nuku o.
I was amazed at myself	Mewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ le ɖokuinye ŋu
But its difficult.	Gake eƒe sesẽ.
I don’t think he can do this	Nyemesusu be ate ŋu awɔ esia o
Without it, it would be impossible to operate.	Ema manɔmee la, manya wɔ be woawɔ dɔ o.
That’s a really long time.	Ema nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I will test your heart	Mado wò dzi kpɔ

He's talking to the police.	Ele nu ƒom na kpovitɔwo.
The whole situation is dead	Nɔnɔme bliboa ku

In fact, you can’t really understand it without it.	Le nyateƒe me la, màte ŋu ase egɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ eya manɔmee o.

Not great, not bad.	Menye gã o, menye nu gbegblẽ o.

And that’s our focus.	Eye emae nye míaƒe susu.

I can’t be like that.	Nyemate ŋu anɔ nenema o.
In fact, it’s the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, esia to vovo na ema.
Just in this one case really.	Le nya ɖeka sia me ko ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I think it was just an insanely long two days	Mesusu be ŋkeke eve didi aɖe si me susu mele o koe wònye
The logic can become very complicated.	Susu si le eme ate ŋu ava sesẽ ŋutɔ.
I can’t tell him the truth yet	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nyateƒea nɛ haɖe o
An idea struck him	Susu aɖe va dze edzi nɛ
Isn’t that just like a man.	Ðe ema mele abe ŋutsu ene ko oa.

He seemed like a really good fit for us	Edze abe amesi sɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ na mí ene
Try and work from there.	Te kpɔ eye nàwɔ dɔ tso afima.
It wouldn’t be possible for him.	Manya wɔ nɛ o.

At least a week, at least two weeks.	Kwasiɖa ɖeka ya teti, kwasiɖa eve ya teti.

That was the first time.	Emae nye zi gbãtɔ.
I definitely had my eye on that thing.	Metsɔ nye ŋku ɖo nu ma ŋu godoo.
I could never tell you how much.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ alesi gbegbe wòle na wò gbeɖe o.
The plaintiff did not do so.	Ame si tsɔ nya ɖe ame ŋu la mewɔe nenema o.
And there’s a reason why.	Eye susu aɖe li si tae.
That could just be me.	Ema ate ŋu anye nye ɖeka ko.
He asked for help himself.	Eya ŋutɔ bia kpekpeɖeŋu.
It should work well.	Ele be wòawɔ dɔ nyuie.
I'm sure, and that's enough	Meka ɖe edzi, eye ema sɔ gbɔ
I relaxed yesterday	Meɖe dzi ɖi etsɔ
He is not passive today.	Menye ame si mewɔa naneke o egbea o.
You just have to do you	Ðeko wòle be nàwɔ wò
He really did great.	Ewɔ nu gã aɖe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I have to go home now	Ele be mayi aƒeme fifia
I am here for you.	Mele afisia na wò.
I don’t know what to do with myself	Nyemenya nusi mawɔ ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu o
This is appropriate.	Esia sɔ.
Yet they have one.	Ke hã ɖeka le wo si.
That made me happy.	Ema do dzidzɔ nam.
I’m not against another man.	Menye nyee tsi tre ɖe ŋutsu bubu ŋu o.
I don’t have time to go into it	Ɣeyiɣi mele asinye be mayi eme o
And they were very happy.	Eye dzi dzɔ wo ŋutɔ.
You are a project.	Wòe nye dɔ aɖe.
And just because something is hard is no reason not to try.	Eye esi nane sesẽ ta la, menye susu aɖeke si tae màte kpɔ o.
I was hoping to get out of it altogether	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be mado le eme kura
I can’t make it work properly.	Nyemate ŋu ana wòawɔ dɔ nyuie o.
Excess is part of it.	Nusi gbɔ eme nye eƒe akpa aɖe.
I think it’s a bit of a good thing	Mesusu be enye nu nyui aɖe vie
But yet his work is not working.	Gake ke hã eƒe dɔ mele dɔ wɔm o.
I needed something to live for	Mehiã nane si ta manɔ agbe ɖo
Some people got it right.	Ame aɖewo se egɔme nyuie.
I know how busy you must be	Menya alesi gbegbe wòle be vovo mele ŋuwò o
I want to know what’s going on	Medi be manya nusi le edzi yim
Work with each child for us.	Wɔ dɔ kple ɖevi ɖesiaɖe na mí.
And it surprised him.	Eye ewɔ nuku nɛ.
I will tell you everything	Magblɔ nya sia nya na wò
I know this book inside out	Menya agbalẽ sia tso eme yi eme
I still can’t figure that out	Nyemete ŋu le nya ma gbɔ kpɔm kokoko o
Maybe not great.	Ðewohĩ menye gã o.
I understand that.	Mese nya ma gɔme.
I am really going to miss you	Mele wò susu ge ŋutɔŋutɔ
I couldn’t make it work	Nyemete ŋu na wòwɔ dɔ o
Can't figure out why it's giving this error.	Mete ŋu kpɔ nusita wòle vodada sia nam o.
I thought it was amazing	Mesusu be ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ
I can save you.	Mate ŋu aɖe wò.
That sounds about right.	Nya ma ɖi nya si sɔ.
Just one problem.	Kuxi ɖeka koe.
I didn’t want to go at all	Nyemedi be mayi kura o
I told them it doesn’t work	Megblɔ na wo be mewɔa dɔ o
I want to know who that is	Medi be manya amesi nye ema
There were too many surprised people.	Ame siwo ƒe nu ku la sɔ gbɔ akpa.
He is just like you, too.	Eya hã le abe wò ene.
But the same thing.	Gake nu ɖeka ma ke.
He is praying.	Ele gbe dom ɖa.
I was too relaxed, too relaxed	Meɖe dzi ɖi akpa, meɖe dzi ɖi akpa
And I was very tired.	Eye ɖeɖi te ŋunye ŋutɔ.
I want some fun	Medi be makpɔ dzidzɔ aɖewo
I have been planning for a while.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia mele ɖoɖo wɔm ɖe eŋu.
Do either or.	Wɔ wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe alo.
You may do the same.	Ate ŋu adzɔ be wò hã nàwɔ nenema ke.
I want a watchdog.	Medi be makpɔ avu si kpɔa amewo dzi.
There was no opportunity.	Mɔnukpɔkpɔ aɖeke menɔ anyi o.
I know about your heart	Menya nu tso wò dzi ŋu
I had something to do	Nane nɔ asinye mawɔ
Let me tell you what happened.	Na magblɔ nu si dzɔ la na wò.
If he had any.	Ne ɖeke nɔ esi la.
I started towards the little house	Medze egɔme yi aƒe sue la gbɔ
It’s as simple as that.	Ele bɔbɔe abe ema ene.
People looked at me.	Amewo lé ŋku ɖe ŋunye.
But you came to his aid.	Gake wò ya va kpe ɖe eŋu.
One thank you for one is totally surreal.	Akpe ɖeka na ɖeka nye nusi me susu mele kura o.
My home is a tough place.	Nye aƒe nye teƒe sesẽ aɖe.
I don’t want that.	Nyemedi nenema o.
Each man fired once.	Ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe da tu zi ɖeka.
I could hear something else there too	Nye hã mete ŋu se nu bubu aɖe le afima
I can’t imagine other possibilities either	Nyemete ŋu le susu me be nu bubu siwo ate ŋu anɔ anyi hã o
These two knew each other.	Ame eve siawo nya wo nɔewo.
I’m glad the project is finished	Edzɔ dzi nam be dɔa wu enu
I knew exactly what I was going to do	Menya nusi tututu mawɔ
However, it is not necessary.	Ke hã, mehiã o.
I love the time I spend with my dog	Ɣeyiɣi si metsɔ nɔa nye avu gbɔ la dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
At least a few hours	Gaƒoƒo ʋɛ aɖewo ya teti
You can see right through them.	Àte ŋu akpɔ nu to wo dzi tututu.
I want to know exactly where you are	Medi be manya afi si tututu nèle
And as it is.	Eye abe alesi wòle ene.
All he had, really, was time.	Nusi nɔ esi, le nyateƒe me, koe nye ɣeyiɣi.
I really want money.	Medi ga ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I had to meet him there at four	Ele nam be mado go le afima le ga ene me
I couldn’t understand them	Nyemete ŋu se wo gɔme o
And that’s another thing.	Eye ema hã nye nu bubu.
It’s easy.	Ele bɔbɔe.
That’s not a problem either.	Ema hã menye kuxi o.
This is very expensive.	Esia xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
That much is true.	Nu geɖe ma nye nyateƒe.
That was wonderful, wonderful.	Ema wɔ nuku ŋutɔ, ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
I will take care of everything	Makpɔ nusianu gbɔ
I just want to get out of this place.	Ðeko medi be mado le teƒe sia.
No one has ever said this before.	Ame aɖeke megblɔ nya sia kpɔ o.
Everything is a book.	Nu sia nu nye agbalẽ.
I worked with him once.	Mewɔ dɔ kplii zi ɖeka.
I don’t know what that’s about	Nyemenya nusi ŋu nya ma ku ɖo o
I have to go to work in an hour	Ele be mayi dɔme le gaƒoƒo ɖeka megbe
He is looking for a way.	Ele mɔ aɖe dim.
I think you know what’s in them	Mesusu be ènya nusi le wo me
And no one objected.	Eye ame aɖeke metsi tre ɖe eŋu o.
I know better than to do that.	Menya nyuie wu be mawɔ ema.
I was just too nervous	Ðeko metsi dzodzodzoe akpa
And it’s not easy for him.	Eye mele bɔbɔe nɛ o.
I tried to figure out who it was	Medze agbagba be makpɔ amesi wònye
I can talk to you all tomorrow	Mate ŋu aƒo nu na mi katã etsɔ
I'll be back soon.	Mava kpuie.
He obviously didn’t ask the right question.	Edze ƒã be mebia nya si sɔ o.
I couldn’t help but join him	Nyemete ŋu wɔ naneke wu be mawɔ ɖeka kplii o
In fact, we are not.	Le nyateƒe me la, míele nenema o.
I just need to deal with this	Ðeko wòle be makpɔ esia gbɔ
Please give me a call.	Taflatse ƒo ka nam.
I could never figure out what that thing was	Nyemete ŋu nya nusi nu ma nye gbeɖe o
Not a good day for me.	Menye ŋkeke nyui aɖeke nam o.
I need to know these things.	Ele be manya nu siawo.
He couldn't quite remember her name.	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku eƒe ŋkɔ dzi tututu o.
As it is the case.	Abe alesi wòle ene la.
But it is true.	Gake enye nyateƒe.
I never wanted to hit anyone	Nyemedi gbeɖe be maƒo ame aɖeke o
I am doing the work.	Nyee le dɔa wɔm.
I’m not trying to say anything.	Menye ɖe mele agbagba dzem be magblɔ nya aɖeke o.
I can do anything about it.	Mate ŋu awɔ nusianu ɖe ​​eŋu.
A mistake that no longer matters	Vodada si megale vevie o
I was shocked, but still not surprised	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ, gake mewɔ nuku nam kokoko o
I am sure he will do well.	Meka ɖe edzi be awɔe nyuie.
We’ve known each other too long.	Míenya mía nɔewo ɣeyiɣi didi akpa.
I tried to spit it out again	Medze agbagba be maɖe ta ɖe eŋu ake
I can keep my mind on it	Mate ŋu ana nye susu nanɔ eŋu
Which is good for me.	Nusi nyo nam.
It’s important to me.	Ele vevie nam.
You have to do some work.	Ele be nàwɔ dɔ aɖewo.
I have already asked this question twice	Mebia nya sia zi eve xoxo
Suggest that you make arrangements.	Do susu ɖa be nàwɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
It didn’t work that way.	Mewɔ dɔ nenema o.
But he had to work on it.	Gake ele nɛ be wòawɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
I was going to answer them now	Menɔ wo ŋu ɖo ge azɔ
I tried to keep my mind on it	Medze agbagba be nye susu nanɔ eŋu
I was just surprised.	Ðeko wòwɔ nuku nam.
I thought no one could be there	Mesusu be ame aɖeke mate ŋu anɔ afima o
I could go on and on about this.	Mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ nya sia ŋu.
I could go on and on really	Mate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ edzi yim ŋutɔŋutɔ
It worked well for me.	Ewɔ dɔ nyuie nam.
No one can find anything.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu ake ɖe naneke ŋu o.
I have so much to tell you and so little time	Nya geɖe le asinye magblɔ na mi eye ɣeyiɣi sue aɖe koe le asinye
I heard his people are too	Mese be eƒe amewo hã le nenema
I had been collecting them	Menɔ wo nu ƒom ƒu kpɔ
So far, very little has happened in that direction.	Vaseɖe fifia la, nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe dzɔ le mɔ ma nu.
I said everything.	Megblɔ nya sia nya.
There is no water.	Tsi aɖeke meli o.
A year is a long time	Ƒe ɖeka nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe
That will work.	Ema awɔ dɔ.
I really wanted to know more about it	Medi vevie be manya nu geɖe tso eŋu
If so, it’s amazing.	Ne ele nenema la, ke ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
He wasn’t sure yet.	Meka ɖe edzi haɖe o.
He didn’t want to go home.	Medi be yeayi aƒeme o.
No one knows much about them.	Ame aɖeke menya nu geɖe tso wo ŋu o.
I need alone time with you	Mehiã ɣeyiɣi si nye ɖeka kpli wò
This is a very difficult issue.	Esia nye nya sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
I thought that was just me.	Mesusu be nye koe nye ema.
I am so angry right now	Medo dziku ale gbegbe fifia
I knew it would happen.	Menya be ava eme.
Please get closer.	Taflatse te ɖe eŋu.
I want to know how it is	Medi be manya ale si wòle
Or it could do the exact opposite.	Alo ate ŋu awɔ nusi to vovo kura na ema.
We are working on it.	Míele dɔ wɔm tso eŋu.
I don’t think he would mind.	Mesusu be maɖe fu nɛ o.
I think there are two reasons for this	Mesusu be susu eve aɖewo tae wòle alea ɖo
I don’t know his name or exact location.	Nyemenya eƒe ŋkɔ alo teƒe si tututu wòle o.
I would have felt something	Anye ne mese nane le ɖokuinye me hafi
The wind blew hard tonight.	Ya ƒo sesĩe le zã sia me.
We can interpret this in two ways.	Míate ŋu aɖe esia gɔme le mɔ eve nu.
Not that I necessarily enjoyed it	Menye ɖe mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu kokoko o
This is not true at all.	Esia menye nyateƒe kura o.
A couple of people we know have worked on this	Ame eve aɖewo siwo míenya la wɔ dɔ tso esia ŋu
I don’t know what’s going on	Nyemenya nusi le edzi yim o
I will be your law	Nyee anye se na wò
A real kind of.	Ƒomevi ŋutɔŋutɔ aɖe.
It will be easier.	Anɔ bɔbɔe wu.
I don’t know what came over me	Nyemenya nu si va dzinye o
I need to go out more often	Ehiã be mado go zi geɖe wu
That is a matter of law.	Ema nye se ƒe nya.
I have some things to tell you	Nu aɖewo le asinye magblɔ na mi
I saw what he did to you.	Mekpɔ nu si wòwɔ ɖe ŋuwò.
I have no books here	Agbalẽ aɖeke mele asinye le afisia o
He was very surprised.	Ewɔ nuku nɛ ŋutɔ.
I don’t want to get involved	Nyemedi be maƒo ɖokuinye ɖe eme o
Ema dim.	Ema dim.
I heard only one person got a comment	Mese be ame ɖeka koe xɔ nya aɖe tso eŋu
None of them would let go.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke maɖe asi le eŋu o.
That will be coming very soon.	Ema ava kpuie ŋutɔ.
I told myself to relax.	Megblɔ na ɖokuinye be maɖe dzi ɖi.
I wouldn’t have that	Ema manɔ asinye o
I know he cares deeply about this	Menya be etsɔ ɖe le nya sia me ŋutɔ
I know it will happen eventually	Menya be ava eme mlɔeba
If you know, you know.	Ne ènya la, ke ènya.
I’m not bothering anyone.	Nyemele fu ɖem na ame aɖeke o.
And a little bit about them.	Eye nu vi aɖe tso wo ŋu.
But he could never do that.	Gake mate ŋu awɔ ema gbeɖe o.
I can’t see that.	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ ema o.
I’ve been there before.	Meva afima kpɔ.
There’s some smoke in there too.	Dzudzɔ aɖewo le afima hã.
I was just trying to relax	Ðeko menɔ agbagba dzem be maɖe dzi ɖi
And now I’m on it.	Eye fifia me le edzi.
No people or cars.	Amewo alo ʋu aɖeke meli o.
I almost felt for him	Mese le ɖokuinye me kloe ɖe eŋu
A man came out.	Ŋutsu aɖe do go.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
You know what you want.	Ènya nusi dim nèle.
But he won’t do it.	Gake mawɔe o.
An idea came to him	Susu aɖe va susu me nɛ
But he didn’t do much more.	Gake mewɔ nu geɖe wu o.
I knew he didn’t want to be there	Menya be medi be yeanɔ afima o
A few people were watching us	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo nɔ mía kpɔm
I let myself go	Meɖe asi le ɖokuinye ŋu
I was too angry with him	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu akpa
Yet, it seems that people with that name do exist.	Ke hã edze abe ame siwo xɔ ŋkɔ ma li ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.
I saw through and between them	Mekpɔ nu to wo me kple wo dome
I am really going to miss you	Mele wò susu ge ŋutɔŋutɔ

I wanted too much and I was moving on	Medi vevie akpa eye menɔ ŋgɔ yim
I had been talking to him.	Menɔ nu ƒom kplii kpɔ.
I know it’s too easy	Menya be ele bɔbɔe akpa
We don’t know your name.	Míenya wò ŋkɔ o.
I have never seen one	Nyemekpɔ ɖeke kpɔ o
It will take at least two months.	Axɔ ɣleti eve ya teti.
This takes time.	Esia bia ɣeyiɣi.
This means that it is still small.	Esia fia be ele sue kokoko.
Thank you so much in advance.	Akpe geɖe na mi do ŋgɔ.
Everyone told me it wouldn’t be comfortable the first time.	Amesiame gblɔ nam be maɖe dzi ɖi zi gbãtɔ o.
No matter, this is an unnecessary problem.	Mehiã o, esia nye kuxi si mehiã o.
I doubt it can upset you	Meke ɖi be ate ŋu ado dziku na wò
This is very important to me.	Esia le vevie nam ŋutɔ.
You are the first person.	Wòe nye ame gbãtɔ.
This may be easier for you.	Ðewohĩ esia anɔ bɔbɔe na wò.
I knew that in his character	Menya ema le eƒe nɔnɔme me

I had asked about it too	Nye hã mebia nya tso eŋu kpɔ
But it will come, in its own time.	Gake ava, le eya ŋutɔ ƒe ɣeyiɣi me.
We have to work together.	Ele be míawɔ dɔ ɖekae.
This is not a problem.	Esia menye kuxi aɖeke o.
No money, no better life.	Ga aɖeke meli o, agbe si nyo wu hã meli o.
No one was watching him.	Ame aɖeke menɔ edzi kpɔm o.
Just that it is one.	Ðeko be enye ɖeka.

I'll see you there	Makpɔ wò le afi ma
I think it might be possible.	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ate ŋu adzɔ.
My voice is too loud.	Nye gbe sesẽ akpa.
I didn’t know what to say to him.	Nyemenya nya aɖeke magblɔ nɛ o.

We will do everything we can.	Míawɔ nusianu si míate ŋui.
Maybe I can give you that idea	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu agblɔ susu ma na wò
No one can find fault with anything you do.	Ame aɖeke mate ŋu akpɔ vodada aɖeke le nu sia nu si nèwɔ me o.
I thought someone told me something.	Mesusu be ame aɖe gblɔ nane nam.

We have a lot to do.	Nu geɖe le mía si míawɔ.

A man can only go without water for a few days	Ŋkeke ʋɛ aɖewo koe ŋutsu ate ŋu anɔ anyi tsi manɔmee
And it probably will.	Eye anɔ eme be awɔe nenema.
No one was on my side	Ame aɖeke menɔ nye akpa dzi o
So far, that has been possible.	Vaseɖe fifia la, ema anya wɔ.
For some reason, this works for me.	Le susu aɖewo ta la, esia wɔa dɔ nam.
I just gave them the money	Ðeko metsɔ ga la na wo
This is very important to me.	Esia le vevie nam ŋutɔ.

He couldn't help it, but he liked it.	Mete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o, gake eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.

I don’t want to let you go	Nyemedi be maɖe asi le ŋuwò o

He didn’t know if it was true.	Menya nenye be enye nyateƒe o.
There were few surprises.	Nu ʋɛ aɖewo koe wɔ nuku na ame.
I shouldn’t have been so angry with you	Mele be mado dziku ɖe ŋuwò nenema hafi o
I really struggle with it	Mewɔa avu kplii ŋutɔŋutɔ
I heard about what happened	Mese nu tso nusi dzɔ ŋu
I know this very well	Menya esia nyuie ŋutɔ
I have done it many times.	Mewɔe zi geɖe.
It seemed almost too much.	Edze abe nusi gbɔ eme kloe ene.
A little thing, really	Nu sue aɖe, le nyateƒe me
Some of them are obvious.	Wo dometɔ aɖewo dze ƒã.
I don’t know what’s going to happen	Nyemenya nusi adzɔ o
I wonder how long that will take	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɣeyiɣi didi kae ema axɔ hã
I am making plans for myself	Mele ɖoɖo wɔm na ɖokuinye
I'm sure I'm not going to apologize now	Meka ɖe edzi be nyemele kuku ɖe ge fifia o
I couldn’t really see past that	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ nu wu ema ŋutɔŋutɔ o
Because of him and her.	Le eya kple eya ta.
Now they are like that.	Fifia wole nenema.
I don’t know where to look	Nyemenya afi si madi o
I can remember that night very vividly	Mete ŋu ɖo ŋku zã ma dzi nyuie ŋutɔ
Eventually, it will pass.	Mlɔeba la, ava yi.
I could only reach in and.	Ðeko mete ŋu ɖo asi ɖe eme eye.
There seems to be a problem brewing.	Edze abe kuxi aɖe le ŋgɔ yim ene.
I was shocked when I realized what it was	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ esi mekpɔ nusi wònye la dze sii
Be really careful.	Kpɔ nyuie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I think there’s someone for everyone	Mesusu be ame aɖe li na amesiame
A man he barely knew	Ŋutsu aɖe si menya kura o
Now he has none.	Fifia ɖeke mele esi o.
Have a small house	Aƒe sue aɖe le ame si
I don’t know them well	Nyemenya wo nyuie o
It was just like.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe.
Or someone can do it.	Alo ame aɖe ate ŋui.
Everything is not good for you.	Nusianu mele nyuie na wò o.
They are easier to reach.	Wo gbɔ ɖoɖo le bɔbɔe wu.
But that’s all that’s coming.	Gake ema koe nye nusi gbɔna.
I should have never done it.	Mele be mawɔe gbeɖe o hafi.
I wish he would rush me	Ne ɖe wòawɔ kaba ɖe ŋunye la, anye ne mewɔe nenema
This made me happy.	Esia na mekpɔ dzidzɔ.
Little else can be done	Nu bubu boo aɖeke mate ŋu awɔ o
However, you can actually do what you want.	Ke hã, le nyateƒe me la, àte ŋu awɔ nu si nèdi.
I tried once and again	Medze agbagba zi ɖeka zi gbɔ zi geɖe
Make a plan for it.	Wɔ ɖoɖo ɖe eŋu.
Everything will be great.	Nusianu anye nu gã aɖe.
I just wanted to say this	Ðeko medi be magblɔ nya sia
Appropriate conditions.	Nɔnɔme siwo sɔ.
Every word is important.	Nya ɖesiaɖe le vevie.
More people, more food, coming for him.	Ame geɖe wu, nuɖuɖu geɖe wu, gbɔna nɛ.
It will be many times more useful.	Aɖe vi geɖe wu zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
Many people went there	Ame geɖe yi afima
There’s just something about it.	Nane koe le eŋu.
I don’t want to explain anything	Nyemedi be maɖe naneke me o
I explained what had happened	Meɖe nusi dzɔ la me nɛ
Actually, that’s not the only issue.	Le nyateƒe me la, menye nya ɖeka koe nye ema o.
He probably didn’t.	Anɔ eme be mewɔe nenema o.
But nothing came of it.	Gake naneke meva o.
It could have been anything.	Ate ŋu anye nusianu hafi.
I'll come and see you	Mava kpɔ wò
I can’t rely on that	Nyemate ŋu aɖo ŋu ɖe ema ŋu o
He took one.	Etsɔ ɖeka.
I doubt it will happen	Meke ɖi be ava eme
However, he cannot do it on his own.	Ke hã, mate ŋu awɔe le eɖokui si o.
This does not seem to be the case	Edze abe esia mele alea o ene
To some extent, this is true.	Vaseɖe afi aɖe la, esia nye nyateƒe.
Try it out.	Te ɖa.
I had to get the truth out	Ele be maɖe nyateƒea ɖe go
I said this matter-of-factly	Megblɔ nya sia le nyateƒe me
I started searching as soon as his name appeared	Medze didi gɔme esi eƒe ŋkɔ dze ko
I'll just wear them.	Ðeko mado wo.
I thought he cared about me	Mesusu be etsɔ ɖe le eme nam
I know what to expect with it	Menya nusi makpɔ mɔ na kplii
Tell us what we can do better.	Gblɔ nusi míate ŋu awɔ nyuie wu la na mí.
What he was looking for.	Nusi dim wònɔ.
In fact, we can’t.	Le nyateƒe me la, míate ŋui o.
I have to get this right	Ele nam be makpɔ esia nyuie
I was so angry with myself for feeling that way	Medo dziku ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu ale gbegbe be mese le ɖokuinye me nenema
I didn’t have a job.	Dɔ aɖeke menɔ asinye o.
There are no two ways about it.	Mɔ eve aɖeke meli le eŋu o.
It’s not about one man.	Menye ŋutsu ɖeka ŋu nya o.

It also has its parts.	Eƒe akpa aɖewo hã le esi.
Or get closer to it.	Alo te ɖe eŋu.
I like your people.	Wò amewo ƒe nu lé dzi nam.
I am looking for a part time job	Mele ɣeyiɣi aɖe ƒe dɔ dim
It was so sweaty.	Enye fifia ale gbegbe.
I think this is a big challenge for us.	Mesusu be esia nye kuxi gã aɖe na mí.
That was all there was.	Ema koe nye nusi nɔ anyi.
Again, he had two months.	Le afisia hã la, ɣleti eve nɔ eŋu.
That’s normal here now.	Ema nye nusi sɔ le afisia fifia.
And now, we know.	Eye fifia, míenya.
I hadn’t heard of it until I found out	Nyemese eŋu nya o vaseɖe esime menya ko
It made sense in its way.	Susu nɔ eme le eƒe mɔ nu.
I need to see what’s going on	Ele be makpɔ nusi le edzi yim
I still didn’t trust myself to speak	Nyemeka ɖe ɖokuinye dzi kokoko be maƒo nu o
It may never be.	Ate ŋu anye be manɔ nenema gbeɖe o.
He didn’t let go of her hand.	Meɖe asi le eƒe asi ŋu o.
If there is no better way, it will work.	Ne mɔ bubu aɖeke meli si nyo wu ema o la, awɔ dɔ.
I couldn’t see how he could	Nyemete ŋu kpɔ alesi wòate ŋui o
I had an idea for a name	Susu aɖe nɔ asinye le ŋkɔ aɖe ŋu
I know who we can live with	Menya ame siwo míate ŋu anɔ anyi kplii
But he was tired tonight.	Gake ɖeɖi te eŋu le zã sia me.
But he seemed to like it.	Gake edze abe edzɔ dzi nɛ ene.
This car probably cost less.	Ʋu sia anya xɔ ga sue aɖe ko.
None of them agreed with him.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke mewɔ ɖeka kplii o.
I have nothing to wear.	Naneke mele asinye mado o.
People do that too often.	Amewo wɔa nu ma zi geɖe akpa.
But now he couldn’t.	Gake fifia ya mete ŋui o.
Finally, just one point.	Mlɔeba la, nya ɖeka koe.
I had never heard of any of them	Nyemese wo dometɔ aɖeke ŋkɔ kpɔ o
I wasn’t looking for a king	Menye fia dim menɔ o
I had already promised him life	Medo agbe ƒe ŋugbe nɛ xoxo
He did something.	Ewɔ nane.
Everyone suffered greatly.	Amewo katã kpe fu ŋutɔ.
This result would be absurd.	Nusi ado tso eme sia anye nusi me susu mele o.
And you’re missing the point.	Eye èle nya la tom.
Maybe a lot, maybe a little.	Ðewohĩ nu geɖe, ɖewohĩ vi aɖe.
But I do know one thing	Gake menya nu ɖeka ya
Her amused voice annoyed him.	Eƒe gbe si doa dzidzɔ nɛ la do dziku nɛ.
That sounded like a bell.	Ema ɖi gaƒoƒo aɖe.
I will take care of everything	Makpɔ nusianu gbɔ
I can’t do this to her	Nyemate ŋu awɔ esia ɖe eŋu o
But I wasn’t too happy about it	Gake nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu boo o
He didn’t want to fight her.	Medi be yeawɔ avu kplii o.
I couldn’t even make a phone call	Nyemete ŋu ƒo ka hã o
I think that’s a good point	Mesusu be nya nyui aɖee nye ema
I wanted to be there.	Medi be manɔ afima.
I am convinced of that	Meka ɖe nya ma dzi
In fact, the.	Le nyateƒea me la.
I hope all is well	Mele mɔ kpɔm be wo katã wole nyuie
In fact, we know absolutely nothing about them.	Le nyateƒe me la, míenya naneke kura tso wo ŋu o.
I should never have let it go	Mele be maɖe asi le eŋu gbeɖe o hafi
I know it can’t be easy	Menya be mate ŋu anɔ bɔbɔe o
I need help please help me.	Mehiã kpekpeɖeŋu taflatse kpe ɖe ŋunye.
I have more than enough space	Teƒe si sɔ gbɔ wu le asinye
I tried a lot of things	Mete nu geɖe kpɔ
I never saw your car	Nyemekpɔ wò ʋua kpɔ o
And that’s definitely true.	Eye esia nye nyateƒe godoo.
I wasn’t that excited about it	Nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe eŋu nenema gbegbe o
It is true that	Enye nyateƒe be .
We know very little about him.	Nu sue aɖe koe míenya tso eŋu.
Those in it speak for us.	Ame siwo le eme la ƒoa nu ɖe ​​mía nu.
Now it doesn’t feel that way.	Fifia mese le eɖokui me nenema o.
I wanted to know what was wrong with him	Medi be manya nusi le fu ɖem nɛ
He liked the money he was making.	Ga si wònɔ ga kpɔm la dze eŋu.
This can also be a mistake.	Esia hã ate ŋu anye vodada.
He has everything.	Nusianu le esi.
You may answer, or you may not.	Àte ŋu aɖo eŋu, alo màte ŋu aɖo eŋu o.
I just wanted to promise you	Ðeko medi be mado ŋugbe na wò
I did it.	Mewɔe.
Let’s pretend that makes sense.	Mina míawɔ abe ɖe susu le nya ma me ene.
More planning is needed though.	Ehiã be woawɔ ɖoɖo geɖe wu gake.
I was home alone all night	Nye ɖeka koe nɔ aƒeme zã bliboa
I just had to see something	Ðeko wòle be makpɔ nane
I will always make mistakes	Mawɔ vodada ɣesiaɣi
Everyone including the teacher laughed!.	Amesiame si me nufiala la hã le la ko nu!.
But I seem to know what to do with it	Gake edze abe menya nusi mawɔ kplii ene
It certainly makes a lot of sense.	Susu geɖe le eme godoo.
Go back to the background.	Trɔ yi megbe va.
He will find it.	Ake ɖe eŋu.
He never sent it.	Meɖoe ɖa kpɔ o.
I'm sure we can have fun together.	Meka ɖe edzi be míate ŋu akpɔ dzidzɔ ɖekae.
I was the one he was looking for	Nyee nye amesi dim wònɔ
This helped a little.	Esia kpe ɖe eŋu vie.
I know what this means now	Menya nusi esia fia fifia
I was always alone, really alone	Nye ɖeka koe nɔa anyi ɣesiaɣi, nye ɖeka koe nɔa anyi ŋutɔŋutɔ
I want to tell you something	Medi be magblɔ nya aɖe na wò
Once this is complete, we will work on it.	Ne esia wu enu ko la, míawɔ dɔ tso eŋu.
Any idea to do here.	Susu ɖesiaɖe si woawɔ le afisia.
I have never heard your voice or seen your face	Nyemese wò gbe kpɔ alo kpɔ wò mo kpɔ o
I remembered his face	Meɖo ŋku eƒe mo dzi
I'll go now.	Mayi azɔ.
There was no big hole.	Do gã aɖeke menɔ afima o.
Not sure what to make of it	Nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ tso eŋu dzi o
But the issue seems more complicated.	Gake edze abe nya la sesẽ wu ene.
But the truth remains true.	Gake nyateƒea gakpɔtɔ nye nyateƒe.
I think it’s very important	Mesusu be ele vevie ŋutɔ
I was hoping it would help now.	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be akpe ɖe ŋunye fifia.
And so did I.	Eye nye hã.
In my car.	Le nye ʋu me.
I wonder why that is	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukatae wòle nenema hã
I had to stay after that	Ele be manɔ anyi le ema megbe
I have no money now	Ga aɖeke mele asinye fifia o
It was only an hour later.	Gaƒoƒo ɖeka koe nye ema megbe.
It won’t be easy for you.	Manɔ bɔbɔe na wò o.
That all happened.	Ema katã dzɔ.
I know you’re looking for a treat.	Menya be èle nuɖuɖu aɖe dim.
It actually happened.	Edzɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I don’t think I saw one.	Nyemesusu be mekpɔ ɖeka o.
This will take some time.	Esia axɔ ɣeyiɣi aɖe.
Look at this road.	Kpɔ mɔ sia dzi ɖa.
This is just another one.	Esia nye bubu aɖe ko.
This surprised me a lot	Esia wɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Nyemekpɔ naneke si le abe esia ene kpɔ o.
Nothing else is needed.	Nu bubu aɖeke mehiã o.
This is good for me	Esia nyo nam
And there are good and bad things about it.	Eye nu nyui kple nu gbegblẽ le eŋu.
I don't know why he did that	Nyemenya nu si tae wòwɔ nu ma ɖo o
Something had to be done.	Ele be woawɔ nane.
For each other.	Na wo nɔewo.
This would be complicated.	Esia anye nusi me kɔ.
I was there when his life ended.	Menɔ afima esime eƒe agbe nu yi.
I didn’t have any money either	Ga aɖeke menɔ asinye hã o
I should have been home an hour ago	Ele be mava aƒeme gaƒoƒo ɖeka enye sia
Life is not a school.	Agbe menye suku o.
I wasn’t going to die	Menye ɖe menɔ ku ge o
I felt satisfied	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye dzi dze eme
But they are here somewhere.	Gake wole afisia le afi aɖe.
I just kind of found myself here	Ðeko mekpɔ ɖokuinye le afisia le mɔ aɖe nu
You can do you just now.	Àte ŋu awɔ wò fifia ko.
I know nothing about any rocks	Nyemenya naneke tso kpe aɖeke ŋu o
I just hope it’s not me .	Ðeko mele mɔ kpɔm be menye nyee o .
Blood will come out of it.	Ʋu ado le eme.
And in the right places.	Eye le teƒe siwo sɔ.
I’m not going to run.	Nyemele du dzi yim o.
So is mine, too.	Nenema ke nye tɔ hã le.
I just can’t prove it right now	Ðeko nyemate ŋu aɖo kpe edzi fifia o
Some others left, too.	Ame bubu aɖewo hã dzo.
Callers are not talking.	Ame siwo le ka ƒom na amewo mele nu ƒom o.
This will usually be in a few places.	Zi geɖe la, teƒe ʋɛ aɖewo koe esia anye.
I can’t stand that guy	Nyemate ŋu anɔ te ɖe ŋutsu ma nu o
Take each of these statements.	Tsɔ nya siawo dometɔ ɖe sia ɖe.
Just this morning.	Ŋdi sia ko.
I aimed the gun at the back of his head	Meɖo tu la ɖe eƒe ta megbe
It doesn’t fit.	Medze o.
There is no trick to it.	Aɖaŋu aɖeke mele eŋu o.
Check out another one.	Kpɔ bubu ɖa.
I really don’t know what to say	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemenya nya si magblɔ o
And it could happen again.	Eye ate ŋu adzɔ nenema ake.
You are everything.	Wòe nye nusianu.
I'm sure it's some kind of money	Meka ɖe edzi be ga ƒomevi aɖee
I was having a great time	Menɔ dzidzɔ kpɔm ŋutɔ
I have always been here	Menɔ afisia ɣesiaɣi
A man nearby threw himself to one side	Ŋutsu aɖe si te ɖe afima ŋu tsɔ eɖokui ƒu gbe ɖe akpa ɖeka
The whole time.	Ɣeyiɣi bliboa katã.
I know it wasn’t easy for him either	Menya be menɔ bɔbɔe nɛ hã o
I don’t know any better that it’s not normal	Nyemenya naneke nyuie wu be menye nusi sɔ o
I am not like that.	Nyemele nenema o.
I think he responded	Mesusu be ewɔ nu ɖe ​​edzi
And that’s not really a problem for me at all.	Eye ema menye kuxi nam ŋutɔŋutɔ kura o.
I can do something better	Mate ŋu awɔ nane si nyo wu
It will be this time or never.	Anye ɣeyiɣi sia alo gbeɖe o.
But a lot has changed.	Gake nu geɖe trɔ.
I almost knew what it was	Menya nusi wònye kloe
Can.	Ate ŋu.
No one asked them.	Ame aɖeke mebia wo o.
A challenge unlike anything he had done before	Kuxi aɖe si to vovo na nusianu si wòwɔ va yi
The desire to be alone.	Didi be ye ɖeka yeanɔ anyi.
I hope it all works out for you all.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be anyo na mi katã.
It was as if it had done him good.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe wòwɔ nyui nɛ ene.
That’s what you are.	Wòe nye ema.
That is how I would treat any man	Mawɔ nu ɖe ​​ŋutsu ɖesiaɖe ŋu nenema
But that’s not his problem.	Gake menye emae nye eƒe kuxi o.
I’m not okay with that.	Nyemele nyuie le nya ma me o.
I can’t do that to us	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nu ma ɖe mía ŋu o
I’m the ultimate good guy	Nyee nye ŋutsu nyui mamlɛtɔ
I'll see you tonight	Makpɔ wò le zã sia me
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
I really don’t want to know.	Le nyateƒe me la, nyemedi be manya o.
But this life is not easy at all.	Gake agbe sia mele bɔbɔe kura o.
I am on the latter road now	Mele mɔ mamlɛtɔ dzi fifia
I wasn’t going to do it	Menye ɖe menɔ ewɔ ge o
Like nothing different.	Abe naneke si to vovo o ene.
Overall, the following can be said.	Le nusianu me la, míate ŋu agblɔ nya siwo gbɔna.
Nothing was too much trouble	Naneke meɖe fu na wo akpa o
But, his face.	Gake, eƒe mo.
I doubt he would be surprised	Meke ɖi be awɔ nuku nɛ
It has everything one could want.	Nusianu si ame ate ŋu adi la le eme.
I can’t help you there	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò le afima o
I can live without them	Mate ŋu anɔ agbe wo manɔmee
And he was there.	Eye wònɔ afima.
I couldn’t hear anything	Nyemete ŋu se naneke o
Look closely at his face.	Lé ŋku ɖe eƒe mo ŋu nyuie.
I couldn’t understand it.	Nyemete ŋu se egɔme o.
It hurt so much.	Eve nu geɖe ŋutɔ.
I didn’t know anyone there	Nyemenya ame aɖeke le afima o
But in reality, the opposite is true.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, nusi to vovo na emae nye nyateƒe.
There is no time for that.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖeke meli na ema o.
I think it can be very useful	Mesusu be ate ŋu aɖe vi geɖe ŋutɔ
This wasn’t working.	Esia menɔ dɔ wɔm o.
That pretty much sums me up.	Ema ƒo nu tso ŋunye kpuie ko kloe.
But they have one thing in common.	Gake nu ɖeka aɖe le wo si.
But it happened.	Gake edzɔ.
That would be a bad thing.	Ema anye nu gbegblẽ.
I had to find somewhere else.	Ele be madi teƒe bubu aɖe.
Not much to do.	Menye nu geɖe si woawɔ o.
I was very pleased with it.	Edzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ.
That’s an easy thing to do.	Ema nye nu bɔbɔe aɖe si wòle be woawɔ.
It was like everyone had turned on them.	Ðeko wònɔ abe ɖe amesiame trɔ ɖe wo ŋu ene.
I was angry.	Medo dziku.
I wonder what’s next	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be nukae gbɔna hã
I would have at least tried	Anye ne mate kpɔ ya teti hafi
I blinked as he continued	Meɖe ŋku ɖe eŋu esi wònɔ edzi yim
I wanted to do a few things before that	Medi be mawɔ nu ʋɛ aɖewo do ŋgɔ na ema
I hope there is nothing from this.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be naneke meli tso esia me o.
The material here is excellent.	Nya siwo le afisia la nyo ŋutɔ.
I hope to get a break	Mele mɔ kpɔm be makpɔ dzudzɔ
There was one problem.	Kuxi ɖeka aɖe nɔ anyi.
I was furious with him	Medo dziku ɖe eŋu vevie
I was able to try several of them.	Mete ŋu te wo dometɔ geɖe kpɔ.
Otherwise, he would have known what was inside.	Ne menye nenema o la, anye ne anya nusi le eme.
Maybe there are reasons why someone isn’t there.	Ðewohĩ susu aɖewo li siwo tae ame aɖe meli o.
It’s not a small thing.	Menye nu sue aɖe ko o.
It was a very difficult job.	Enye dɔ sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ.
I need to have a major operation	Ele be woawɔ dɔ gã aɖe nam
I think it’s going to be great, great.	Mesusu be anye nu gã aɖe, nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ.
But we have a very good idea.	Gake susu nyui aɖe ŋutɔ le mía si.
I think it might be you	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ wòe
A year or two, or maybe more.	Ƒe ɖeka alo eve, alo ɖewohĩ esi wu nenema.
I couldn’t concentrate	Nyemete ŋu tsɔ nye susu ɖo nu ŋu o
I can go on with my life.	Mate ŋu ayi nye agbe dzi.
We know absolutely nothing.	Míenya naneke kura o.
I must have fallen for that	Anɔ eme be medze anyi le ema ta
And he won’t say he’ll play a role.	Eye magblɔ be yeawɔ akpa aɖeke o.
He doesn’t need any.	Mehiã ɖeke o.
I hope he is, too.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be eya hã le nenema.
And we have to deal with them all the time.	Eye ele be míawɔ nu kpli wo ɣesiaɣi.
Thanks to everyone who contributed.	Akpe na amesiame si kpe asi ɖe eŋu.
I was very relaxed	Meɖe dzi ɖi ŋutɔ
I was nervous to talk to him	Metsi dzodzodzoe be maƒo nu kplii
Fight fire with fire.	Tsɔ dzo wɔ avu kple dzo.
I needed every one of them.	Mehiã wo dometɔ ɖesiaɖe.
This is just me talking now.	Nye koe nye esia le nu ƒom fifia.
Few words passed between them.	Nya ʋɛ aɖewo koe to wo dome.
I have never seen a better horse in my life	Nyemekpɔ sɔ si nyo wu esia le nye agbe me kpɔ o
I happen to know someone who might know.	Edzɔ be menya ame aɖe si ate ŋu anya.
Think before you act.	Bu eŋu hafi nàwɔ nane.
I think he’s really tired now	Mesusu be ɖeɖi te eŋu ŋutɔŋutɔ fifia
Nothing too dramatic.	Naneke meli si wɔ nuku ŋutɔ o.
I believe this or that	Mexɔ esia alo ema dzi se
And that, and that.	Eye ema, kple ema.
I would love to do it.	Adzɔ dzi nam ŋutɔ be mawɔe.
I'm just not sure what to do about it	Ðeko nyemeka ɖe nusi mawɔ tso eŋu dzi o
Not if this continues.	Menye ne esia yi edzi o.
There is a lot to do	Nu geɖe li woawɔ
I know, we know, but you lived alone	Menya, míenya, gake wò ɖeka koe nɔ agbe
Come let’s try it.	Va na míate kpɔ.
I want consistency	Medi be woawɔ nu ɖekae
It never got that easy.	Meva nɔ bɔbɔe nenema gbegbe gbeɖe o.
He probably needed the money.	Anɔ eme be ehiã ga la.
We can’t do that.	Míate ŋu awɔ ema o.
I don’t know exactly what it is.	Nyemenya nusi tututu wònye o.
I just need time on my own	Ðeko mehiã ɣeyiɣi le ɖokuinye si
This bill will do neither.	Se sia mawɔ wo dometɔ aɖeke o.
I never saw any part of that place	Nyemekpɔ teƒe ma ƒe akpa aɖeke kpɔ o
There is a reason for it.	Susu aɖe li si tae.
I think they should be regulated	Mesusu be ele be woawɔ ɖoɖo ɖe wo ŋu
I don't mean to say that's you	Menye ɖe meɖoe be magblɔ be wòe nye ema o
These little mistakes matter.	Vodada sue siawo le vevie.
I need more than that	Mehiã nu geɖe wu ema
They had no children	Vi aɖeke menɔ wo si o
It never worked.	Mewɔ dɔ kpɔ o.
No one else has met this man.	Ame bubu aɖeke medo go ŋutsu sia o.
I wanted her attention	Medi be eƒe susu nanɔ eŋu
Period.	Ɣeyiɣi.
People are not as popular as he could be.	Amewo mexɔ ŋkɔ abe alesi wòate ŋui ene o.
He was a great guy.	Enye ŋutsu gã aɖe.
A few of them are going to retire	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo le dzudzɔ xɔ ge
You can probably expect more of the same here.	Ðewohĩ àte ŋu akpɔ mɔ na nu ma ke geɖe le afisia.
A very small road.	Mɔ sue aɖe ŋutɔ.
Have a good one!!!!!!.	Ame nyui aɖe nanɔ asiwò!!!!!!.
I felt like I knew this better	Mese le ɖokuinye me be menya esia nyuie wu
Have a nice afternoon.	Ŋdɔ nyui aɖe.

I hope he's not worried about the money	Mele mɔ kpɔm be metsi dzi ɖe ga la ŋu o
This is a difficult problem.	Esia nye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
I can contact you very quickly if needed	Mate ŋu ake ɖe ŋuwò kaba ŋutɔ ne ehiã
Quite the opposite.	Nusi to vovo kura na emae wònye.
I was hoping everything would be fine	Menɔ mɔ kpɔm be nusianu anyo
I look forward to working with you	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mawɔ dɔ kpli mi
I couldn’t turn my back on them	Nyemete ŋu trɔ megbe de wo o
That’s not the same thing.	Ema menye nu ɖeka o.
That’s a really good thing.	Ema nye nu nyui ŋutɔŋutɔ.
That was his life.	Emae nye eƒe agbe.
Something is over his head.	Nane le eƒe ta dzi.
He didn’t seem to mind.	Edze abe meɖe fu nɛ o ene.
I have said this over and over again.	Megblɔ nya sia zi gbɔ zi geɖe.
He had a thing for that place.	Nane nɔ esi na teƒe ma.
And that’s just kids who talk.	Eye ɖevi siwo ƒoa nu koe nye ema.
No words came up.	Nya aɖeke meva o.
But there was time besides.	Gake ɣeyiɣi aɖe nɔ anyi tsɔ kpe ɖe eŋu.
Or stop them.	Alo tɔ te wo.
But no one can know everything.	Gake ame aɖeke mate ŋu anya nu sia nu o.
I know where that kid is.	Menya afisi ɖevi ma le.
I was fine with that	Menɔ nyuie le nya ma me
At least now he can prove it.	Fifia ya teti la, ate ŋu aɖo kpe edzi.
Have two people on hand.	Na ame eve nanɔ asiwò.
He may be that real to them but not to himself.	Ate ŋu anye ame ŋutɔŋutɔ ma na wo gake menye na eya ŋutɔ o.
I resisted, I prayed against it	Metsi tre ɖe eŋu, medo gbe ɖa tsi tre ɖe eŋu
He couldn’t ask that question.	Mete ŋu bia nya ma o.
He had no heart.	Dzi aɖeke menɔ esi o.
Another day was angry.	Ŋkeke bubu hã do dziku.
I have to do this now	Ele be mawɔ esia fifia
I can’t come now, not today	Nyemate ŋu ava fifia o, menye egbea o
I have to do it.	Ele be mawɔe.
We were happy for them.	Dzi dzɔ mí ɖe wo ta.
I'll take care of that part.	Makpɔ akpa ma gbɔ.
But he found nothing, and no one found him.	Gake mekpɔ naneke o, ame aɖeke hã meke ɖe eŋu o.
I didn’t have much space	Teƒe boo aɖeke menɔ asinye o
I already know what happened	Menya nusi dzɔ xoxo
It doesn’t do any work on its own.	Mewɔa dɔ aɖeke le eɖokui si o.

So that everything is easy.	Ale be nusianu nanɔ bɔbɔe.
Once or twice, maybe more.	Zi ɖeka alo zi eve, ɖewohĩ geɖe wu.

As if he really didn’t care.	Abe ɖe le nyateƒe me la, metsɔ ɖeke le eme o ene.
I can’t go on living these days	Nyemate ŋu ayi edzi anɔ agbe le ŋkeke siawo me o
Too hard to work inside.	Sesẽ akpa be woawɔ dɔ le eme.
But things have gotten complicated now.	Gake nuwo va sesẽ fifia.

And it worked for me.	Eye ewɔ dɔ nam.

That’s not life for a dog.	Ema menye agbe na avu o.

Everything is dry.	Nusianu ƒu.

That way, no one will bother you.	To mɔ sia dzi la, ame aɖeke maɖe fu na wò o.

I think we can do this in a simple way	Mesusu be míate ŋu awɔ esia le mɔ bɔbɔe nu
Tell me this is possible.	Gblɔ nam be esia ate ŋu adzɔ.
To my surprise, I got sick	Ewɔ nuku nam ŋutɔ be medze dɔ

I was just there last night	Ðeko menɔ afima zã si va yi
I wonder if he really struggles with that	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe wòle avu wɔm kple nu ma ŋutɔŋutɔ hã
What this is in itself we do not know.	Nusi esia nye le eɖokui si míenya o.
In fact, he was going to send us home.	Le nyateƒe me la, ele mía ɖo ge ɖe aƒeme.
The point is too important for this.	Nya la le vevie akpa na esia.
Maybe that would be good for us.	Ðewohĩ ema anyo na mí.
We are now welcomed by a fresh breeze	Ya nyui aɖe xɔ mí fifia
Part of it is true.	Eƒe akpa aɖee nye nyateƒe.
What a meal!!!.	Nuɖuɖu kae nye si!!!.
He has the word.	Nya la le esi.
I started to get angry	Meva nɔ dziku dom
I can’t help you	Nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò o
I don’t know how long	Nyemenya ɣeyiɣi didi kae o
Because I am not.	Le esi menye ta.
A very good quality.	Nɔnɔme nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Not two of them.	Menye eve o.
I was very nervous.	Metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔ.
Everything that was there was there.	Nusianu si nɔ afima la nɔ afima.
He did everything he could.	Ewɔ nusianu si wòate ŋui.
I knew nothing before the meeting	Nyemenya naneke do ŋgɔ na kpekpea o
I'm hoping for a nice hot one	Mele mɔ kpɔm na ɖeka nyui aɖe si me dzo le
I know your type.	Menya wò ƒomevi.
None of them knew.	Wo dometɔ aɖeke menya o.
I can’t imagine why he did that	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nusita wòwɔ nenema le susu me o
He never made time.	Mewɔ ɣeyiɣi kpɔ o.
I have nowhere to go	Afi aɖeke meli mayi o
Personally, I have never felt that way about anyone.	Nye ŋutɔ nyemese le ɖokuinye me nenema le ame aɖeke ŋu kpɔ o.
It can’t be true.	Mate ŋu anye nyateƒe o.
One death is enough.	Ku ɖeka sɔ gbɔ.
I can collect anything	Mate ŋu aƒo nusianu nu ƒu
I heard something	Mese nya aɖe
This means something.	Esia fia nane.
It is what it is.	Enye nusi wònye.
That was another man.	Ŋutsu bubu aɖee nye ema.
It was a simple project where I needed very few materials.	Enye dɔ bɔbɔe aɖe si mehiã nu ʋɛ aɖewo ko le.
You’re there.	Wòe li.
Maybe he can help me.	Ðewohĩ ate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye.
Everyone had laughed, but it was true.	Amesiame ko nu kpɔ, gake enye nyateƒe.
I did, but couldn’t prove it.	Mewɔe, gake mete ŋu ɖo kpe edzi o.
I would have been here sooner otherwise	Anye ne meva afisia kaba ne menye nenema o la
I don’t mean to offend you.	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mado dziku na wò o.
I was just hoping you could help me with that	Ðeko menɔ mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu akpe ɖe ŋunye le ema me
He tried to imagine what had happened.	Edze agbagba be yeakpɔ nusi dzɔ la le susu me.
It will be interesting on how that plays out.	Adzɔ dzi na ame le alesi ema awɔe ŋu.
That time was a long, long time ago.	Ɣeyiɣi ma nye ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe, ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe va yi.
This is also a difficult situation.	Esia hã nye nɔnɔme sesẽ aɖe.
Waste of time and money.	Ɣeyiɣi kple ga gbegblẽ.
That is also very expensive.	Ema hã xɔ asi ŋutɔ.
I will be here for several more weeks at least	Manɔ afisia kwasiɖa geɖe bubu ya teti
Maybe that doesn’t matter.	Ðewohĩ ema mehiã o.
It’s more complicated.	Eƒe nɔnɔme sesẽ wu.
I had some personal work to do tonight	Nye ŋutɔ nye dɔ aɖewo nɔ asinye mawɔ le zã sia me
The car started in reverse.	Ʋua dze egɔme le megbe.

This is a wonderful place.	Esia nye teƒe nyui aɖe ŋutɔ.
Only one time.	Ɣeyiɣi ɖeka koe.
I don’t know much about it	Nyemenya nu geɖe tso eŋu o
Not at this hour.	Menye le gaƒoƒo sia me o.
I didn’t hear any music	Nyemese ha aɖeke o
There are two of them.	Wo dometɔ eve li.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But take your time.	Gake di wò ɣeyiɣi.
He didn’t seem tired.	Edze abe ɖeɖi mete eŋu o ene.
I only have this part	Akpa sia koe le asinye
Yet this already seems likely to be the case.	Ke hã edze abe esia anɔ alea xoxo ene.
Maybe I'll try another one	Ðewohĩ mate bubu kpɔ
People are talking.	Amewo le nu ƒom.
I think he will understand	Mesusu be ase egɔme

I'll do it for you somehow	Mawɔe na wò le mɔ aɖe nu
Research available jobs.	Ku nu me le dɔ siwo li ŋu.
I should have lived a better life.	Ðe wòle be manɔ agbe si nyo wu hafi.
I hope you can understand that	Mele mɔ kpɔm be àte ŋu ase nya ma gɔme
Not for everyone.	Menye na amesiame o.
You almost literally just did the exact same thing.	Ðeko nèwɔ nu ma tututu ŋutɔŋutɔ kloe.
I want to see everything good in a person.	Medi be makpɔ nu nyui ɖesiaɖe le ame ŋu.
That is very possible.	Ema anya wɔ ŋutɔ.
I can’t tell you that.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nya ma na mi o.
But you can be alone.	Gake wò ɖeka koe ate ŋu anɔ anyi.
You can’t work.	Màte ŋu awɔ dɔ o.
I wonder how many of them are still together	Mebia ɖokuinye be wo dometɔ nenie gakpɔtɔ le wo nɔewo gbɔ hã
I think money is good	Mesusu be ga nyo
This was now clear to him.	Esia me kɔ nɛ azɔ.
I can’t do anything like that	Nyemate ŋu awɔ naneke nenema o
Before that, nothing.	Do ŋgɔ na ema la, naneke meli o.
I must have an idea.	Ele be susu aɖe nanɔ asinye.
Nothing would bother him now.	Naneke maɖe fu nɛ fifia o.
Not here, anyway.	Menye afisia o, le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
What an incredible part of your life right now.	Aleke gbegbe wò agbe ƒe akpa aɖee nye esi mexɔ se o enye si fifia.
Maybe I was wrong.	Ðewohĩ mewɔ vodada.
I got a good job out of it.	Mekpɔ dɔ nyui aɖe le eme.
Or something similar.	Alo nane si sɔ kplii.
But I have one concern	Gake nu ɖeka aɖe le asinye si ŋu metsi dzi ɖo
But there is good news.	Gake nya nyui aɖe li.
Every house fell down.	Aƒe ɖesiaɖe ge dze anyi.
I still can’t talk about it	Nyemete ŋu le nu ƒom tso eŋu kokoko o
That really started something.	Emae dze nane gɔme ŋutɔŋutɔ.
And this place, too.	Eye teƒe sia hã.

I hope he didn’t	Mele mɔ kpɔm be mewɔe nenema o
Remember.	Ɖo ŋku edzi.
I happened to be nearby	Edzɔ be mete ɖe afima ŋu
I’m not going to tell you anything.	Nyemele nya aɖeke gblɔ ge na wò o.
I want to move forward	Medi be mayi ŋgɔ
I want that too, but not now	Nye hã medi nenema, gake menye fifia o
I felt very strongly about my dog	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ŋutɔ ɖe nye avu ŋu
I understand you very well	Mese wò gɔme nyuie ŋutɔ
For years and years.	Ƒe geɖe kple ƒe geɖe.
But that would be a challenge.	Gake ema anye kuxi sesẽ aɖe.
Now tell me what happened.	Azɔ gblɔ nusi dzɔ la nam.
Every man thought he had his own name in that song.	Ŋutsu ɖe sia ɖe susui be ye ŋutɔ yeƒe ŋkɔ le ha ma me.
I can’t feel it anywhere.	Nyemate ŋu ase le eɖokui me le afi aɖeke o.
They like the fact that they don’t have much to do.	Nyateƒe si wònye be nu geɖe mele wo si woawɔ o la dzɔa dzi na wo.
I’m not that guy.	Menye nyee nye ŋutsu ma o.
They didn’t make sense.	Susu menɔ wo me o.
A year or two.	Ƒe ɖeka alo eve.
I don’t want to be in that place	Nyemedi be manɔ teƒe ma o
That’s over.	Ema wu enu.
But keep things in order.	Gake na nuwo nanɔ nyuie.
It’s a part of you, somewhere.	Wò akpa aɖee wònye, le afi aɖe.
This made it easier for me.	Esia na wònɔ bɔbɔe nam.
And the gun of tea.	Le tu la te.
But he made a mistake.	Gake ewɔ vodada.
Just a big mistake, really.	Vodada gã aɖe koe, le nyateƒe me.
The same thing applies here.	Nu ma ke le afisia hã.
I would have lived in a big house	Anye ne manɔ aƒe gã aɖe me hafi
I understand where you are coming from.	Mese afisi nèle tso afima gbɔna gɔme.
More than once, too.	Wu zi ɖeka hã.
I can’t get any better than that	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ nu si nyo wu ema o
I felt they were there	Mese le ɖokuinye me be wole afima
But we can’t do it without you.	Gake míate ŋu awɔe wò manɔmee o.
I’m not sure, but maybe.	Nyemeka ɖe edzi o, gake ɖewohĩ.
I want to have my own home	Medi be nye ŋutɔ nye aƒe nanɔ asinye
I can’t seem to help it	Edze abe nyemate ŋu akpe ɖe eŋu o ene
He was usually alone.	Zi geɖe la, eya ɖeka koe nɔa afima.
There were two people in it.	Ame eve nɔ eme.
But everyone knows what and who he is.	Gake amesiame nya nusi wònye kple amesi wònye.
He didn’t know what to do with them.	Menya nusi wòawɔ ɖe wo ŋu o.
I can say that about myself	Mate ŋu agblɔ nya ma tso ɖokuinye ŋu
I haven’t been this happy in a long time	Ɣeyiɣi didi aɖee nye esia nyemekpɔ dzidzɔ alea gbegbe o
I couldn’t have predicted what would have happened to them	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nusi adzɔ ɖe wo dzi hafi o
We were very excited.	Dzi dzɔ mí ŋutɔ.
I just don’t know how to proceed from here.	Ðeko nyemenya alesi mawɔ ayi edzi tso afisia o.
I think everyone is just tired.	Mesusu be ɖeɖi te amesiame ŋu ko.
I only saw the last hour	Gaƒoƒo mamlɛtɔ koe mekpɔ
There is no good reason.	Susu nyui aɖeke meli o.
I just wanted a place	Ðeko medi be teƒe aɖe nanɔ
It could not have been necessary.	Mate ŋu anye nusi hiã hafi o.
I really want to do this	Medi be mawɔ esia nyateƒe
That can take as long as a year.	Ema ate ŋu axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi aɖe abe ƒe ɖeka ene.
I’ve known you for a very long time	Menya wò ɣeyiɣi didi ŋutɔ
Or, anything could be, move on.	Alo, nusianu ate ŋu anɔ nenema, yi edzi.
I want to know more	Medi be manya nu geɖe
But it seems important to me.	Gake edze nam abe ele vevie ene.
This time a man stopped.	Fifia ya ŋutsu aɖe tɔ.
I found out where he was.	Meva ke ɖe afisi wòle ŋu.
I happened to find this in a very strange place.	Edzɔ be mekpɔ esia le teƒe aɖe si mewɔ nuku kura o.
I think that’s enough	Mesusu be ema sɔ gbɔ
Word got out that someone was looking for you.	Nya la do be ame aɖe le wò dim.
What is this error.	Nukae nye vodada sia.
And if the ultimate cause of everything, consider this.	Eye ne nu mamlɛtɔ si gbɔ nusianu tso la, ke bu esia ŋu kpɔ.
He couldn’t do that.	Mete ŋu wɔ nu ma o.
I think it’s a good thing	Mesusu be enye nu nyui aɖe
I can’t sit there with them	Nyemate ŋu anɔ anyi kpli wo le afima o
Perhaps that is too harsh.	Ðewohĩ ema nye nya sesẽ akpa.
Perhaps he will find his way into his own.	Ðewohĩ akpɔ mɔ ava ɖe eya ŋutɔ tɔ me.
But maybe that would be a good thing.	Gake ɖewohĩ ema anye nu nyui aɖe.
Here is the work you have yet to do.	Dɔ si nàwɔ haɖe le afisia.
This is true, for many reasons.	Esia nye nyateƒe, le susu geɖe ta.
I hope it helps you.	Mele mɔ kpɔm be akpe ɖe ŋuwò.
I was worried about me too	Nye hã metsi dzi ɖe ŋunye
I don’t know if that’s true.	Nyemenya nenye be nya ma nye nyateƒe o.
I am a good guy.	Ŋutsu nyui aɖee menye.
There was something else at work here.	Nu bubu aɖe hã nɔ dɔ wɔm le afisia.
I admire anyone who can do that	Amesiame si ate ŋu awɔ nu ma la dzɔa dzi nam ŋutɔ
People dress like they used to.	Amewo doa awu abe tsã ene.
I think that worked well	Mesusu be ema wɔ dɔ nyuie
I can’t do that.	Nyemate ŋu awɔe nenema o.
It’s a very strange thing.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
It seemed like a good day.	Edze abe ŋkeke nyui aɖee wònye ene.
It’s kind of old school in that way.	Enye suku xoxo ƒomevi aɖe le mɔ ma nu.
I have to let you go	Ele be maɖe asi le ŋuwò
And without money.	Eye ga manɔmee.
I heard the gunshot.	Mese tu la ƒe gbe.
I never felt sick.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me kpɔ be medze dɔ o.
In the past.	Le ɣeyiɣi siwo va yi me.
Next week is going to be a little harder.	Kwasiɖa si gbɔna la ava sesẽ vie.

I just wanted to go home	Ðeko medi be mayi aƒeme
He had a different kind of head.	Ta ƒomevi bubu aɖe nɔ esi.
I didn’t like the way his attention made me feel	Ale si eƒe susu nɔ ŋunye na mese le ɖokuinye me la medze ŋunye o
Your this plan.	Wò ɖoɖo sia.
We don’t know what else it is.	Míenya nu bubu si wònye o.
There is only you.	Wò koe li.
Just to try it out.	Be mate kpɔ ko.
No one expected it this morning.	Ame aɖeke mekpɔ mɔ nɛ ŋdi sia o.

I think it’s a great idea	Mesusu be enye susu gã aɖe ŋutɔ
I wanted some good chapters maybe more	Medi ta nyui aɖewo ɖewohĩ geɖe wu
In fact, there is nothing.	Le nyateƒe me la, naneke mele eme o.
He’s interested in it.	Etsɔ ɖe le eme.
This is very damaging.	Esia gblẽ nu ŋutɔ.
I listened carefully but couldn’t keep up	Meɖo to nyuie gake nyemete ŋu wɔ ɖeka kplii o

Nothing can do that.	Naneke mate ŋu awɔe nenema o.

Keep up the good work!.	Yi dɔ nyui la dzi!.

He is in no mood to fight.	Mele nɔnɔme aɖeke me be wòawɔ avu o.

But it is impossible.	Gake manya wɔ o.

That was probably the last time.	Anɔ eme be emae nye zi mamlɛtɔ.

He is fascinated by her.	Ele eƒe nu lé dzi nɛ.
But someone is missing.	Gake ame aɖe bu.
He had a desire to act.	Didi nɔ eme be yeawɔ nu.
Some things can help with that.	Nu aɖewo ate ŋu akpe ɖe ame ŋu le ema me.

I can’t really handle this, really	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ esia gbɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ, le nyateƒe me o
Never wish you could do better.	Di gbeɖe be yeate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu.
They will be amazing.	Woawɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
But he could never do that.	Gake mate ŋu awɔ ema gbeɖe o.
Part of me wanted to go home with him.	Nye akpa aɖe di be yeayi aƒeme kplii.
One shot at a time.	Tu ɖeka ɖeka.
I couldn’t bear it.	Nyemete ŋu do dzi o.

I felt it was important	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ele vevie

I have this one.	Esia le asinye.
It seems like a daunting task.	Edze abe dɔ sesẽ aɖee wònye ene.
I think he has a point.	Mesusu be nya aɖe le esi.
Or his disappearance.	Alo eƒe bu.
Use whatever you have.	Zã nusianu si le asiwò.
I just saw them yesterday	Ðeko mekpɔ wo etsɔ koe nye ema
I just want to live a normal life.	Ðeko medi be manɔ agbe si sɔ.
I was bothered, more than anything	Meɖe fu nam, wu nusianu
It’s easy for you.	Ele bɔbɔe na wò.
I was so angry with myself.	Medo dziku ɖe ɖokuinye ŋu ale gbegbe.
Perhaps you too.	Ðewohĩ wò hã.
You have to have respect.	Ele be bubu nanɔ asiwò.
That’s pretty amazing, too.	Ema hã wɔ nuku ŋutɔ.
That would be a good idea.	Ema anye susu nyui.
After a while for too much truth.	Ɣeyiɣi aɖe megbe na nyateƒe si sɔ gbɔ akpa.
This is a long road.	Esia nye mɔ didi aɖe.
But on one condition.	Gake le nɔnɔme ɖeka nu.
He had never seen himself like this before.	Mekpɔ eɖokui alea kpɔ o.
In this case, two of them.	Le go sia me la, wo dometɔ eve.
I promise it will be useful	Medo ŋugbe be aɖe vi nɛ
I was looking for some jobs	Menɔ dɔ aɖewo dim
We don’t have very sophisticated minds.	Susu siwo de ŋgɔ ŋutɔ mele mía si o.
It’s not that bad.	Menye nu gbegblẽ nenema gbegbe o.
I just wish we could reach more people	Ðeko medi be míate ŋu aɖo ame geɖe gbɔ
But there is still this big hole in my life.	Gake do gã sia gakpɔtɔ le nye agbe me.
That’s the perfect word for it.	Emae nye nya si sɔ nyuie na esia.
I felt strong myself	Mese le ɖokuinye me be nye ŋutɔ nye lãme sesẽ

It’s all very old school.	Wo katã nye suku xoxo ŋutɔ.
I liked his smile.	Eƒe nu dze ŋunye.

I didn’t mean to do that	Menye ɖe meɖoe be mawɔe nenema o
I need something, man	Mehiã nane, ŋutsu
And a lot of time, too.	Eye ɣeyiɣi geɖe hã.
That made me nervous.	Ema na metsi dzodzodzoe.
They are working or working.	Wole dɔ wɔm alo wole dɔ wɔm.
He didn’t do it.	Mewɔe o.
No one needs them.	Ame aɖeke mehiã wo o.
Run, run, run.	Ƒu du, ƒu du, ƒu du.
That is our job.	Emae nye míaƒe dɔ.

There was no space.	Teƒe aɖeke menɔ anyi o.

Please any help would be greatly appreciated.	Taflatse kpekpeɖeŋu ɖesiaɖe aɖe vi ŋutɔ.

I want them to do well.	Medi be woawɔ nu nyuie.
I approached him at once	Mete ɖe eŋu zi ɖeka

There is simply no other way.	Ðeko mɔ bubu aɖeke meli o.

We knew we were going to be hit hard.	Míenya be wole mía ƒo ge vevie.
I can’t allow myself to become like him	Nyemate ŋu aɖe mɔ be mava nɔ abe eya ene o
I really fell for the job here.	Medze anyi ɖe dɔa dzi le afisia ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Police seized the vehicle at this time.	Kpovitɔwo xɔ ʋua le ɣeyiɣi sia me.
Check out this place!.	Kpɔ teƒe sia ɖa!.
Everything has to be done.	Ele be woawɔ nusianu.

He just couldn’t have done it.	Ðeko mate ŋu awɔe hafi o.

Quite a few of them actually.	Wo dometɔ ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔŋutɔ.

I think that’s a good thing	Mesusu be nu nyui aɖee nye ema
I’m sorry, but it is.	Meɖe kuku, gake ele nenema.

Two men entered his home.	Ŋutsu eve ge ɖe eƒe aƒea me.

People need you.	Amewo hiã wò.

Just add a little salt.	Dze vi aɖe ko de eme.
I don’t want him to be alone	Nyemedi be eya ɖeka nanɔ anyi o
But it doesn’t look like one.	Gake medze abe ɖeka ene o.
It didn’t bother me much	Meɖe fu nam boo o
Not against him, as a person.	Menye ɖe eŋu o, abe ame ene.
But the point is clear.	Gake nya la me kɔ.
And to some extent, perhaps.	Eye vaseɖe afi aɖe la, ɖewohĩ.
I just want your attention	Ðeko medi wò susu
There was an atmosphere there.	Nɔnɔme aɖe nɔ afima.
He seemed a little indifferent.	Edze abe metsɔ ɖeke le eme o vie ene.
That kind of thing can save lives.	Nu ma ƒomevi ate ŋu axɔ amewo ɖe agbe.
Your time, now.	Wò ɣeyiɣi, fifia.
It’s the same old, same old.	Enye xoxo ma ke, xoxo ma ke.
This project will most likely take longer.	Anɔ eme godoo be dɔ sia axɔ ɣeyiɣi didi wu.
I said it could take months	Megblɔ be ate ŋu axɔ ɣleti geɖe
I felt someone slap me hard on the back	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ame aɖe ƒo nye megbe sesĩe
I plan to do something about that in a few years.	Meɖoe be mawɔ nane tso ema ŋu le ƒe ʋɛ aɖewo megbe.
There is only up or down.	Dzi alo anyi koe li.
His head was down.	Eƒe ta nɔ anyi.
Maybe it’s been a while too.	Ðewohĩ ɣeyiɣi aɖee nye esia hã.
I know what will happen to him	Menya nusi adzɔ ɖe edzi
I don’t know how to do that.	Nyemenya alesi mawɔe nenema o.
I just want to be here with you	Ðeko medi be manɔ afisia kpli wò
I don’t know what to say	Nyemenya nusi magblɔ o
It’s much easier.	Ele bɔbɔe wu kura.
I had to get rid of this	Ele nam be maɖe esia ɖa
I enjoyed them overall.	Mekpɔ dzidzɔ ɖe wo ŋu le wo katã me.
It’s true, he worked with her.	Enye nyateƒe, ewɔ dɔ kplii.
In your place.	Le wò teƒe.
I can see that tomorrow	Mate ŋu akpɔ ema etsɔ
As he spoke, his voice was very small.	Esi wònɔ nu ƒom la, eƒe gbe nɔ sue ŋutɔ.
Something about it is so familiar.	Nane si ku ɖe eŋu la nye nusi amewo nya nyuie ale gbegbe.
I just couldn’t speak	Ðeko nyemete ŋu ƒo nu o
We are now one.	Míenye ɖeka fifia.
I was really nervous this time	Metsi dzodzodzoe ŋutɔŋutɔ zi sia
I knew it wouldn’t work	Menya be mawɔ dɔ o
People will be there all night.	Amewo anɔ afima zã bliboa.
I had a lot of work to do	Dɔ geɖe nɔ asinye mawɔ
It’s really simple.	Enye nu bɔbɔe ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It will be somewhere in between.	Anɔ afi aɖe le wo dome.
Create your own path.	Wɔ wò ŋutɔ wò mɔ.
I wonder if it was more for me than for him.	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be ɖe wònye nam wu eya hã.
He was a survivor.	Enye amesi tsi agbe.
He had no job, no job.	Dɔ aɖeke menɔ esi o, mewɔ dɔ aɖeke o.
I am the owner of the house	Nyee nye aƒea me tɔ
That’s a common thread between them all.	Ema nye nusi sɔ kple wo nɔewo le wo katã dome.
It was just that way.	Ðeko wònɔ nenema.
That still seems a bit unrealistic.	Ema gakpɔtɔ dze abe ɖe menye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ o vie ene.
Maybe a little too dramatic.	Ðewohĩ ewɔ nuku vie akpa.
I'll talk to you shortly	Maƒo nu kpli wò kpuie
I still have to live.	Ele be manɔ agbe kokoko.
A man can be angry, you know	Ŋutsu aɖe ate ŋu ado dziku, ènya
For many who.	Na ame geɖe siwo.
I didn’t feel like a person	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me abe ame ene o
There was already a corpse.	Kuku aɖe nɔ afima xoxo.
I think that’s a great thing	Mesusu be ema nye nu gã aɖe ŋutɔ
In fact, it’s pretty much everything about me.	Le nyateƒe me la, enye nusianu kloe si ku ɖe ŋunye.
Or my life.	Alo nye agbe.
I think it’s highly anticipated	Mesusu be wole mɔ kpɔm nɛ vevie
I want to know, too	Nye hã medi be manya
I said we could at least try	Megblɔ be míate ŋu ate kpɔ ya teti
I am here to tell you something of some importance	Meva afisia be magblɔ nya aɖe si le vevie vie la na mi
In fact, its just the opposite.	Le nyateƒe me la, eƒe nusi to vovo na ema tututu.
That wouldn’t work.	Ema mawɔ dɔ o.
I felt terrible for him	Mese le ɖokuinye me vevie ɖe eŋu
That’s over for now.	Ema wu enu vaseɖe fifia.
But it’s not as simple as that.	Gake mele bɔbɔe abe ema ene o.
I have to tell you something	Ele be magblɔ nya aɖe na mi
I'm sure on that one.	Meka ɖe edzi le ɖeka ma dzi.
I really needed to go home	Ehiã ŋutɔŋutɔ be mayi aƒeme
What really matters.	Nu si le vevie ŋutɔŋutɔ.
It will come in exactly one week.	Ava le kwasiɖa ɖeka me tututu.
Keep your head up.	Lé wò ta ɖe dzi.
It doesn’t matter.	Vevie aɖeke mele eŋu o.
We can’t do it.	Míate ŋu awɔe o.
I am having fun with you	Mele dzidzɔ kpɔm kpli wò
One can expect.	Ame ate ŋu akpɔ mɔ.
There were exceptions.	Ame aɖewo nɔ anyi siwo to vovo na ema.
I would be too embarrassed.	Ŋu akpe nam akpa.
It’s the most interesting thing.	Enye nusi doa dzidzɔ na ame wu.
I didn’t see anyone	Nyemekpɔ ame aɖeke o
None of us should.	Mele be mía dometɔ aɖeke o.

I couldn’t wait to be alone	Nyemete ŋu nɔ mɔ kpɔm be nye ɖeka manɔ anyi o
I can do no good here.	Nyemate ŋu awɔ nyui aɖeke le afisia o.
The night is good.	Zã la nyo.
Maybe I can deal with it better	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu awɔ nu kplii nyuie wu

There’s something new in there there.	Nu yeye aɖe le afima le afima.
The meeting will last four days.	Kpekpea axɔ ŋkeke ene.
I can’t say much more at this point.	Nyemate ŋu agblɔ nu geɖe wu le ɣeyiɣi sia me o.
It was a very, very difficult time.	Enye ɣeyiɣi sesẽ aɖe ŋutɔ, ŋutɔ.
I sincerely hope you enjoy it	Mele mɔ kpɔm vevie be adzɔ dzi na wò
It seems a bit obvious though.	Edze abe edze ƒã vie gake.

I need to know what you are doing	Ele be manya nu si wɔm nèle
He had never felt this way in his life.	Mese le eɖokui me alea le eƒe agbe me kpɔ o.
I am sure of this.	Meka ɖe esia dzi.
It was his first word.	Enye eƒe nya gbãtɔ.
I'm sure it will be worked out	Meka ɖe edzi be woawɔ dɔ tso eŋu
There is one cable on each device.	Ka ɖeka le mɔ̃ ɖesiaɖe dzi.
I really should do that	Ele be mawɔe nenema ŋutɔŋutɔ
I can help you with this	Mate ŋu akpe ɖe ŋuwò le esia me
Another probably couldn’t make me any worse.	Anɔ eme be bubu mate ŋu ana nye lãme gblẽ ɖe edzi o.
I do this too.	Nye hã mewɔa esia.
It is something real.	Enye nane ŋutɔŋutɔ.
I can’t take a rejection	Nyemate ŋu axɔ gbegbe aɖe o
The car wasn’t very expensive anyway.	Ʋua mexɔ asi boo o le mɔ sia mɔ nu.
I didn’t feel much like working on anything.	Nyemese le ɖokuinye me boo be mawɔ dɔ tso naneke ŋu o.
It will help everyone.	Akpe ɖe ame sia ame ŋu.
A lesser person could never do it	Ame si le sue wu mate ŋu awɔe gbeɖe o
And tell the truth.	Eye nàgblɔ nyateƒea.
I was a little more confident	Meka ɖe dzinye vie wu
I have done my part.	Mewɔ nye akpa dzi kpɔ.

I don’t know if it will be tonight.	Nyemenya nenye be anye zã sia o.

Time is money.	Ɣeyiɣi nye ga.
And that he’s not alone.	Eye be menye eya ɖeka koe o.
I will tell you who struck me.	Magblɔ amesi ƒom la na wò.
I think this one makes a good point too	Mesusu be ame sia hã gblɔ nya nyui aɖe
I think that’s amazing	Mesusu be esia wɔ nuku ŋutɔ
It’s not what it used to be.	Menye nusi nɔ anyi tsã o.
Who would be surprised.	Amekae awɔ nuku nɛ.
This is nothing new either.	Esia hã menye nu yeye o.
But he really didn’t know any of this.	Gake le nyateƒe me la, menya nu siawo dometɔ aɖeke o.
Maybe I can do better somewhere.	Ðewohĩ mate ŋu awɔe nyuie wu le afi aɖe.
I felt that would make up for a lot.	Mese le ɖokuinye me be ema aɖo nu geɖe teƒe.
Right through the pool.	To ta la me tututu.
That kind of thing.	Nu ma ƒomevi.
I would go myself, alone, but who would believe me	Nye ŋutɔ mayi, nye ɖeka, gake amekae axɔ dzinye ase
I had a pretty easy day today	Mekpɔ ŋkeke bɔbɔe aɖe ŋutɔ egbea
I was trying to figure out how to do that.	Menɔ agbagba dzem be makpɔ alesi mawɔ emae.
They have no other skills.	Aɖaŋu bubu aɖeke mele wo si o.
I didn’t know anyone else was here	Nyemenya be ame bubu aɖeke le afisia o
I couldn’t decide what to do	Nyemete ŋu tso nya me le nusi mawɔ ŋu o
I understand you are fine	Mese egɔme be èle nyuie
I needed someone to help me	Mehiã ame aɖe si akpe ɖe ŋunye
He has done this before.	Ewɔ esia do ŋgɔ.
He placed his hand on her face.	Etsɔ eƒe asi ɖo eƒe mo.
I went out tonight and I was happy	Medo go le zã sia me eye mekpɔ dzidzɔ
He has some great ideas.	Susu gã aɖewo le esi.
It didn’t work very well.	Mewɔ dɔ nyuie ŋutɔ o.
I think this is obvious.	Mesusu be esia dze ƒã.
I just need a little time.	Ðeko mehiã ɣeyiɣi vi aɖe.
This is for a number of reasons.	Esia le alea le susu geɖe ta.
I wonder where he was	Mebiaa ɖokuinye be afikae wònɔ hã
I think you’re the smart one	Mesusu be wòe nye amesi dze aɖaŋu
I know you can find it if anyone can	Menya be àte ŋu ake ɖe eŋu ne ame aɖe ate ŋui
Like it was real.	Abe ɖe wònye nu ŋutɔŋutɔ ene.

I threw away a book.	Metsɔ agbalẽ aɖe ƒu gbe.
I just couldn’t stand it	Ðeko nyemete ŋu nɔ te ɖe enu o
I don’t know what’s in it	Nyemenya nusi le eme o
I just couldn’t understand it	Ðeko nyemete ŋu se egɔme o
Very few were like that.	Ame ʋɛ aɖewo ŋutɔ koe nɔ nenema.
Get out of my way.	Do le nye mɔ dzi.
I am one of them myself.	Nye ŋutɔ hã menye wo dometɔ ɖeka.
I thought someone might have been eating them	Mesusu be ɖewohĩ ame aɖe nɔ wo ɖum
I don’t think anyone would know what it was	Mesusu be ame aɖeke manya nusi wònye o
But at the same time, he was a good dog.	Gake le ɣeyiɣi ma ke me la, enye avu nyui aɖe.
I can’t vouch for that either.	Nye hã nyemate ŋu aɖo kpe esia dzi o.
I just really want to talk to you	Ðeko medi vevie be maƒo nu kpli wò
There are many reasons for this.	Susu geɖe li siwo tae.
I told him that was just your opinion	Megblɔ nɛ be wò susu koe nye ema
But you can’t do it.	Gake màte ŋui o.
Not so fast for him.	Menye kaba nenema gbegbe nɛ o.
I knew he was probably sick as a dog	Menya be ɖewohĩ edze dɔ abe avu ene
But this is not true.	Gake esia menye nyateƒe o.
But no words came out of his mouth.	Gake nya aɖeke medo go le eƒe nu me o.
This time is different.	Ɣeyiɣi sia to vovo.
I liked it, but somehow it wasn’t me	Edzɔ dzi nam, gake le mɔ aɖe nu la, menye nyee o
There had been issues.	Nya aɖewo nɔ anyi kpɔ.
I don’t care how you are.	Ale si nèle la metsɔ ɖeke le eme nam o.

There are a couple of really cute parts.	Akpa eve aɖewo siwo nya kpɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ la li.

Money would do him no good there.	Ga maɖe vi aɖeke nɛ le afima o.
I have a clue.	Kpekpeɖeŋu le asinye.
I saw what people were really like.	Mekpɔ alesi amewo le ŋutɔŋutɔ.
Everything is exciting and new.	Nusianu doa dzidzɔ na ame eye wònye nu yeye.
Check out what he did.	Kpɔ nu si wòwɔ la ɖa.
A fun little problem	Kuxi sue aɖe si doa dzidzɔ na ame
I know this for two reasons	Susu eve aɖewo tae menya esia ɖo
And now he needs your help.	Eye fifia ya ehiã wò kpekpeɖeŋu.
I have to beat you	Ele be maƒo wò
Four of them, actually.	Wo dometɔ ene, le nyateƒe me.
I remember my last meal very vividly	Meɖo ŋku nye nuɖuɖu mamlɛtɔ dzi nyuie ŋutɔ
That day has arrived.	Ŋkeke ma ɖo.
I am alone now.	Nye ɖeka koe li fifia.
That finally became apparent.	Ema va dze ƒã mlɔeba.
They’re there.	Wole afima.
Just one of them.	Wo dometɔ ɖeka koe.
I couldn’t find anyone	Nyemete ŋu ke ɖe ame aɖeke ŋu o
I know exactly where he is	Menya afisi tututu wòle
We can’t do anything now.	Míate ŋu awɔ naneke fifia o.
I think this is similar.	Mesusu be esia hã sɔ kple esia.
I have to go to school	Ele nam be mayi suku
He didn’t know what was bothering him.	Menya nusi nɔ fu ɖem nɛ o.
I had nothing to wear	Naneke menɔ asinye mado o
Everyone was surprised.	Ewɔ nuku na amesiame.
It was weird, but he was focused.	Ewɔ nuku ŋutɔ, gake eƒe susu nɔ eŋu.
I always knew that couldn't have been his real name	Menya ɣesiaɣi be ema mate ŋu anye eƒe ŋkɔ ŋutɔŋutɔ hafi o
I can’t find them anywhere	Nyemate ŋu akpɔ wo le afi aɖeke o
Keep your mind focused on the project.	Wò susu nanɔ dɔa ŋu.
Two people should always be running.	Ele be ame eve nanɔ du dzi ɣesiaɣi.
There’s just nothing about it.	Ðeko naneke mele eŋu o.
In no way whatsoever.	Le mɔ aɖeke nu o.
Between these two extremes lies the real truth.	Nyateƒe ŋutɔŋutɔ le nu eve siawo siwo gbɔ eme la dome.
I need to call you	Ehiã be maƒo ka na wò
I decided to keep moving forward	Meɖoe be mayi edzi anɔ ŋgɔ yim

Everyone was happy.	Amesiame kpɔ dzidzɔ.
About four years ago.	Anɔ abe ƒe ene enye sia ene.
No one will fire these people.	Ame aɖeke maɖe ame siawo le dɔ me o.
I’m not going to let that go	Nyemele asi ɖe ge le ema ŋu o
