No more than he did.	Mhux aktar milli għamel hu.
I am trying to be your friend.	Qed nipprova nkun ħabib tiegħek.
He is not leaving.	Mhux qed jitlaq.
I didn’t know about all that.	Ma kontx naf dwar dak kollu.
It's pretty big.	Huwa pjuttost kbir.
I didn’t want to be here myself.	Jien ma ridtx inkun hawn jien.
She was doing this job.	Hija kienet tagħmel dan ix-xogħol.
She can eat normally.	Hija tista 'tiekol normalment.
I really want to know where it came from.	Irrid verament inkun naf minn fejn ġie.
It comes when it comes.	Jiġi meta jiġi.
That you don’t.	Li ma tagħmilx.
I couldn't understand what was going on there.	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien qed jiġri hemmhekk.
It's supposed to work.	Suppost li jaħdem.
Well, there you go.	Ukoll, hemm tmur.
But you're a man.	Imma int raġel.
Put another.	Poġġa ieħor.
Are you from here	Int minn hawn?
I'm your friend.	Jien ħabib tiegħek.
I'm sorry, but no.	Jiddispjaċini, imma le.
I don’t think he is.	Ma naħsibx li hu.
We did this as follows.	Għamilna dan kif ġej.
Obviously, this takes some time.	Ovvjament, dan jieħu xi żmien.
But it was getting late.	Imma kien qed isir tard.
There didn't seem to be anyone.	Ma deher li kien hemm xi ħadd.
It shouldn't be long.	M'għandux ikun twil.
No one had money.	Ħadd ma kellu flus.
Try it and find out what happened.	Ipprova u taf x'ġara.
And there is much more.	U hemm ħafna aktar.
It was such a morning.	Kienet filgħodu bħal din.
I used to do that.	Jien kont nagħmel hekk.
He had to go do it now.	Kellu jmur jagħmel dan issa.
It happens from.	Jiġri minn.
She did something for me that she will never know about.	Hija għamlet xi ħaġa għalija li hi qatt mhu se tkun taf dwarha.
Well, it was.	Ukoll, kien hekk.
He doesn't know where he came from.	Ma jafx minn fejn ġie.
I like it that way too.	Jien inħobb hekk ukoll.
I can't believe she's mine.	Ma nistax nemmen li hi tiegħi.
I want to be with him more.	Irrid inkun miegħu aktar.
It would be time consuming.	Ikun jieħu ħafna ħin.
Well, not this one.	Ukoll, mhux dan wieħed.
I hope this helps someone.	Nittama li dan jgħin lil xi ħadd.
Great to see that.	Kbir biex tara dak.
I want to do this as much as she does.	Irrid nagħmel dan daqs kemm tagħmel hi.
Definitely have.	Żgur li għandhom.
I hope he has.	Nispera li għandu.
Anything can happen, you know.	Jista’ jiġri kollox, taf.
Or a bad man.	Jew raġel ħażin.
Its.	Tiegħu.
Not for a while, he had said.	Mhux għal xi żmien, kien qal.
This or nothing.	Dan jew xejn.
Well, you’re not alone.	Ukoll, int mhux waħdek.
It was more of an idea.	Kienet aktar idea.
She is not here for me.	Hi mhix hawn għalija.
But now it may be too late.	Imma issa jista’ jkun tard wisq.
The problem is who we were.	Il-problema hi li konna aħna.
I will definitely go back.	Żgur li mmur lura.
He was the only one who wasn’t.	Kien l-uniku wieħed li ma kienx.
Not the first, you know.	Mhux l-ewwel, taf.
This is so good and so easy.	Dan huwa daqshekk tajjeb u daqshekk faċli.
And the same thing happens to me.	U l-istess ħaġa jiġri miegħi.
Not too late now.	Le issa tard wisq.
It's too hard.	Huwa wisq diffiċli.
It didn’t look so good.	Ma kienx jara daqshekk tajjeb.
This is not mine!	Din mhix tiegħi!
Nothing was right.	Xejn ma kien tajjeb.
Just not with me.	Biss mhux miegħi.
And they were, really.	U kienu, tassew.
I know this.	Jien naf dan.
But he was very young.	Imma kien żgħir ħafna.
That's it !.	Dan hu!.
And let me tell you - it was a scary place.	U ħa ngħidlek ħaġa oħra.
There! 	Hemm!
Not really an easy thing to do.	Mhux verament ħaġa faċli.
And so she did a lot.	U hekk għamlet ħafna.
Not so now.	Mhux hekk issa.
He loved doing things.	Kien iħobb jagħmel l-affarijiet.
But there was much more.	Imma kien hemm ħafna aktar.
I saw that it wasn’t.	Rajt li ma kinitx.
You will go to school.	Inti se tmur l-iskola.
I hope not.	Nispera li mhux.
And he seemed so scared.	U tant deher jibża.
I want that to happen soon.	Nixtieq li jiġri dalwaqt.
It should be, but it’s not.	Għandu jkun, imma mhux.
This is the first time this has ever happened.	Din hija l-ewwel darba li qatt ġara.
It was great.	Kien kbir.
To do work.	Biex tagħmel xogħol.
He came home.	Ġie d-dar.
That's what everyone did.	Hekk għamel kulħadd.
He may not be playing until then.	Jista’ jkun li ma jkunx qed jilgħab sa dak iż-żmien.
It works on something.	Jaħdem fuq xi ħaġa.
We need more.	Għandna bżonn aktar.
It would have been great to say more.	Kien ikun kbir li ngħid aktar.
But it's not easy to do.	Imma mhux faċli li tagħmel.
But not for much more.	Imma mhux għal ħafna aktar.
What went wrong?	X’kien mar ħażin?
Now I know what it is.	Issa naf x’inhu.
Why do you want to do this?	Għaliex trid tagħmel dan?
He did what he wanted.	Għamel dak li ried hu.
He would go for it as soon as possible.	Kien imur għalih malajr kemm jista’ jkun.
You don't, either.	Inti ma, lanqas.
You see a lot.	Tara ħafna.
So a friend told me.	Hekk qalli ħabib.
He is capable.	Huwa kapaċi.
Everyone knew each other.	Kulħadd kien jaf lil xulxin.
Don't do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan.
And I have a job.	U għandi xogħol.
I want to tell you this.	Irrid ngħidlek dan.
You know that.	Inti taf li.
It's so easy.	Huwa daqshekk faċli.
I couldn't tell.	Ma stajtx tkun taf.
I had a great time.	Kelli ħin tajjeb ħafna.
I thought I did too.	Ħsibt li għamilt ukoll.
He may have just gone home.	Jista’ jkun għadu kemm mar id-dar.
You are too early.	Inti kmieni wisq.
Everyone was sitting on everyone.	Kulħadd kien bilqiegħda fuq kulħadd.
Have you said anything yet?	Għadek għedt xi ħaġa?
I really want to be here.	Irrid ħafna li jkun hawn.
But it seems here more than that.	Imma jidher li hawn aktar minn hekk.
To do something.	Biex tagħmel xi ħaġa.
It would be wrong to do.	Ikun ħażin li tagħmel.
Quick and more.	Malajr u aktar.
No one will speak.	Ħadd mhu se jitkellem.
Whatever happens.	Hu x’inhu dak se jiġri.
He thought he knew so now.	Huwa ħaseb li kien jaf hekk issa.
I have never said anything like this.	Qatt ma għedt xi ħaġa bħal din.
I have no money at the moment.	M'għandi l-ebda flus bħalissa.
Just nothing is ever the same.	Biss xejn mhu qatt l-istess.
They have something we don't have.	Għandhom xi ħaġa li m’għandniex.
I want to try to say something now.	Irrid nipprova ngħid xi ħaġa issa.
Towards the door.	Lejn il-bieb.
You are here now.	Int hawn issa.
He needs to get things done.	Jeħtieġ li jagħmel l-affarijiet.
Well, it could be.	Ukoll, jista 'jkun.
No, only no.	Le, biss le.
That works well.	Li jaħdem tajjeb.
And if she had.	U kieku kellha .
I hope he is.	Nispera li hu.
But here’s something he still can’t leave.	Imma hawn xi ħaġa li għadu ma jistax jitlaq.
You have to go.	Trid tmur.
Probably better than anyone.	Probabbilment aħjar minn ħadd.
You can't tell anyone.	Ma tista’ tgħid lil ħadd.
Ready.	Lest.
But no one was ready to talk about it.	Imma ħadd ma kien lest jitkellem dwarha.
Plus, you can’t do that.	Barra minn hekk, ma tistax tagħmel dan.
If it weren’t, more people would do it.	Kieku ma kienx, aktar nies jagħmlu dan.
Think of something.	Jaħseb xi ħaġa.
The only thing is.	L-unika ħaġa hi.
It wasn’t long ago that it was the same.	Ma kienx twil ilu li kien l-istess.
How everything comes back to me.	Kif kollox jiġi lura għalija.
They are the same.	Huma l-istess.
Better is better.	Aħjar huwa aħjar.
He had thought it would be so.	Huwa kien ħaseb li jkun hekk.
Or something in advance.	Jew xi ħaġa minn qabel.
This had been a long time.	Dan kien ilu żmien twil.
Today, everyone does everything.	Illum, kulħadd jagħmel kollox.
She is not.	Hija mhix.
Tomorrow would not be so bad.	Għada ma jkunx daqshekk ħażin.
I know it’s great.	Naf li huwa tajjeb ħafna.
She had never been here before.	Hija qatt ma kienet hawn qabel.
Not me you are thinking.	Mhux lili qed taħseb.
Your house is too big.	Id-dar tiegħek hija kbira wisq.
To know more about.	Biex tkun taf aktar dwar.
.	.
Not a bit like that.	Mhix daqsxejn hekk.
No one was ever there.	Ħadd qatt ma kien hemm.
But now we are.	Imma issa aħna.
I thought I was on it.	Ħsibt li kont fuq dan.
But he is scared.	Imma hu jibża’.
He had done it.	Huwa kien għamel dan.
I don’t like to be surprised.	Ma nħobbx inkun sorpriż.
It was where it was supposed to be.	Kien fejn suppost kellu jkun.
He really did.	Huwa tassew għamel.
Just not today.	Biss mhux illum.
In fact, it was not difficult.	Fil-fatt, dan ma kienx diffiċli.
It shouldn't have looked like this.	Ma kellux jidher bħal dan.
That's right.	Huwa hekk.
This is the last thing you want.	Din hija l-aħħar ħaġa li trid.
And there was only one way.	U kien hemm mod wieħed biss.
Maybe that’s just not for me.	Forsi dan biss mhuwiex għalija.
And before that, another.	U qabel dan, ieħor.
That can't be a bad thing.	Dik ma tistax tkun xi ħaġa ħażina.
And it's just that.	U huwa biss li.
They are late.	Huma tard.
I like to be alone.	Inħobb inkun waħdi.
And at the time, it was a pretty good idea.	U dak iż-żmien, kienet idea pjuttost tajba.
No one else has ever done that for you.	Ħadd ieħor qatt ma għamel hekk għalik.
But he knows he can't.	Imma jaf li ma jistax.
She had done some time as well.	Hija kienet għamlet xi żmien ukoll.
Maybe not much, maybe a long time.	Forsi mhux ħafna, forsi żmien twil.
And the same problem seems.	U tidher l-istess problema.
I’m going too fast.	Jien sejjer malajr wisq.
I couldn't eat.	Ma stajtx niekol.
It’s still nothing, but it’s still early.	Għadu xejn, imma għadu kmieni.
he asked.	staqsa.
I want to go back.	Irrid lura.
So good.	Hekk hu tajjeb.
I don't want anyone to see this.	Ma rrid li ħadd jara dan.
And someone else.	U xi ħadd ieħor.
Nothing seems to have happened here.	Jidher li qatt ma ġara xejn hawn.
This is a happy time for us.	Dan huwa żmien kuntent għalina.
You are what you eat.	Int dak li tiekol.
That was it.	Li kien.
No time for that now.	L-ebda ħin għal dak issa.
One by one.	Wieħed għal wieħed.
He wasn’t too happy.	Ma kienx kuntent wisq.
As soon as we can go.	Kmieni kemm nistgħu mmorru.
I say no.	Jien ngħid le.
He is.	Huwa hu.
That’s just what we did.	Dak li għamilna biss.
It will take a while, you know.	Se jieħu ftit, taf.
For a few hours, it would have been fine.	Għal ftit sigħat, kien ikun tajjeb.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
That doesn’t seem to be the case.	Dak ma jidhirx.
Good good is better.	Tajjeb tajjeb huwa aħjar.
You must be.	Int trid tkun.
He's back.	Huwa jerġa 'lura.
He has to.	Huwa għandu.
It’s all I didn’t have.	Hu dak kollu li ma kontx.
That’s the same thing we’re doing now.	Dik hija l-istess ħaġa li qed nagħmlu issa.
But they were.	Imma kienu.
And she is not here.	U hi mhix hawn.
For us, it was easy money.	Għalina, kien flus faċli.
That's not it either.	Dik mhux le lanqas.
I know he is.	Naf li hu.
Little by little it can go a long way.	Ftit ftit jista 'jmur ħafna.
And you can't do anything.	U ma tistax tagħmel xejn.
The time is coming.	Il-ħin ġej.
It should be the same here.	Għandu jkun l-istess hawn.
Or me.	Jew lili.
She doesn't say anything bad about anyone.	Hi ma tgħid xejn ħażin fuq ħadd.
I can't believe it now.	Ma nistax nemmen li issa.
It's late afternoon.	Huwa tard wara nofsinhar.
He looked small, like a boy.	Kien jidher żgħir, bħal tifel.
I’ve done this before.	Jien għamilt dan qabel.
He can do the same for you today.	Jista’ jagħmel l-istess għalik illum.
This is what will happen now.	Dan huwa dak li issa se jiġri.
Well, it's better where he is.	Ukoll, huwa aħjar fejn hu.
I doubt you have much of your money.	Niddubita li għandek ħafna flus tiegħek.
This was not happening.	Dan ma kienx qed jiġri.
I know how to listen.	Jien naf nisma’.
I can't speak right now.	Ma nistax nitkellem bħalissa.
He was so great.	Huwa kien tant kbir.
And that would be it.	U dan ikun.
This was not to be.	Dan ma kellux ikun.
Too much, he thought.	Wisq, ħaseb.
And it can be good.	U jista 'jkun tajjeb.
He had never done this before.	Hu qatt ma kien għamel dan qabel.
It was a lot.	Kienet ħafna.
Not so bad.	Mhux daqshekk ħażin.
He left just after you did.	Telaq eżatt wara li għamilt int.
There is no one else, nothing more.	M'hemm ħadd ieħor, xejn aktar.
That’s so hard.	Dak hu tant diffiċli.
It looks good when you do this.	Jidher tajjeb meta tagħmel dan hekk.
And it's good.	U hu tajjeb.
It wasn't his.	Ma kienx tiegħu.
It becomes much easier after that.	Isir ħafna aktar faċli wara dan.
To do that.	Li tagħmel dan.
But not too long.	Imma mhux twil wisq.
I can’t eat much.	Ma nistax niekol ħafna.
You know, every once in a while.	Taf, kull tant drabi.
But! 	Imma!
I'm a friend.	Jien ħabib.
I wasn’t happy at all.	Jien ma kont kuntent xejn.
Money, he says.	Flus, jgħid.
It just works.	Dan jaħdem biss.
That was the dog.	Dak kien il-kelb.
It would be good to know how to do this.	Ikun tajjeb li tkun taf kif tagħmel dan.
Nothing worth doing.	Mhux ta’ min jagħmel xejn.
I like things like that.	Inħobb affarijiet bħal dawn.
That’s the first thing.	Dik hija l-ewwel ħaġa.
No, it wasn’t, either.	Le, ma kienx hekk, lanqas.
He is the same as you.	Huwa l-istess bħal miegħek.
We need you to come with us.	Għandna bżonn li tiġi magħna.
But if all went well.	Imma kieku kollox mar tajjeb.
She doesn't want to go.	Hi ma tridx tmur.
I don’t think they are.	Ma naħsibx li huma.
Now almost there.	Issa kważi hemm.
I believe me.	Jien nemmen jien.
He is a bad boy.	Huwa tifel ħażin.
It still looks too small.	Għadu jidher żgħir wisq.
I can't have it.	Ma nistax ikolli.
I doubt it, but maybe.	Niddubita, imma forsi.
Nobody, ever.	Ħadd, qatt.
But it was a little too late.	Imma kien ftit wisq tard.
I was thinking about it.	Kont qed naħseb dwar dan.
A very good one.	Waħda tajba ħafna.
Everyone does this now.	Kulħadd jagħmel dan issa.
That he was saying something.	Li kien qed jgħid xi ħaġa.
I'm happy for you.	Jien kuntent għalik.
They have another chance to do well.	Għandhom ċans ieħor biex jagħmlu tajjeb.
And so it can.	U hekk jista’.
I’m sure we had something wrong there as well.	Jien ċert li kellna xi ħaġa ħażina hemmhekk ukoll.
This will not be quite.	Dan mhux se jkun pjuttost.
Or it could be something else.	Jew tista 'tkun xi ħaġa oħra.
Not your time.	Mhux il-ħin tiegħek.
All that work, for nothing.	Dak ix-xogħol kollu, għal xejn.
Apparently this is not so.	Milli jidher dan mhux hekk.
He didn’t want to be.	Ma riedx ikun.
I thought he was playing and didn’t know better.	Ħsibt li kien qed jilgħab u ma kienx jaf aħjar.
I have no idea why this is not working.	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex dan mhux qed jaħdem.
The morning was not the same.	Filgħodu ma kienx l-istess.
Just like never before.	Eżatt daqs qatt qabel.
Good for us.	Tajjeb għalina.
Obviously this is not going to happen.	Ovvjament dan mhux se jiġri.
She had known this one for years.	Hija kienet taf dan wieħed għal snin.
I'm trying to do that.	Qed nipprova nagħmel hekk.
I can try that later.	I jista 'jipprova li aktar tard.
I thought he did a really good job there.	Ħsibt li għamel xogħol tassew tajjeb hemmhekk.
No, it was someone.	Le, kien xi ħadd.
He is better than me.	Huwa aktar tajjeb minni.
Maybe it wasn’t.	Forsi ma kienx.
Everyone wants to do more.	Kulħadd ikun irid jagħmel aktar.
Not even a little.	Lanqas ftit.
You are not there yet.	Għadek m'intix hemm.
We were there for a few hours.	Konna hemm għal ftit sigħat.
I can only say.	Nista 'biss ngħid.
She was the only one who did that.	Kienet l-unika waħda li għamlet dan.
I have to go.	Ikolli nkun sejjer.
Nobody did.	Ħadd ma għamel.
So much fun.	Tant gost.
I had had enough of all this!	Kelli biżżejjed minn dan kollu!
We have to go home.	Irridu mmorru d-dar.
They were the same person.	Kienu l-istess persuna.
No, nothing tonight.	Le, xejn illejla.
He would never have thought that what should be, might not be.	Qatt ma kien se jaħseb li dak li għandu jkun, jista 'ma jkunx.
We need more.	Għandna bżonn aktar.
We have too many things.	Għandna wisq affarijiet.
We never had much money.	Qatt ma kellna ħafna flus.
What went before is done.	Dak li mar qabel isir.
He just didn't know how much.	Huwa biss ma kienx jaf kemm.
Apparently there were no problems there.	Milli jidher ma kienx hemm problemi hemmhekk.
She talks a little.	Hija titkellem ftit.
I always say.	Jien dejjem ngħid.
No, she doesn't.	Le, hi ma.
This is your last chance.	Dan huwa l-aħħar ċans tiegħek.
What is today.	X'inhu llum.
It makes on mine.	Jagħmel fuq tiegħi.
Maybe someone else can.	Forsi xi ħadd ieħor jista’.
I’m glad he’s here with me.	Jien ferħan li qiegħed hawn miegħi.
He didn't tell anyone.	Ma qal lil ħadd.
You can go with whatever you want.	Tista' tmur ma' dak kollu li trid.
I know this is not enough.	Naf li dan ma jkunx biżżejjed.
I know how to know.	Naf kif inkun naf.
And he wasn't worried.	U ma kienx inkwetat.
But he knew it wasn't.	Imma kien jaf li ma kienx.
That’s my first one.	Dik hija l-ewwel waħda tiegħi.
We make friends fast.	Nagħmlu ħbieb malajr.
It will never happen.	Qatt ma se jiġri.
Nothing is right or wrong.	Xejn mhu tajjeb jew ħażin.
I would be happy.	Inkun kuntent.
And they do.	U jagħmlu dan.
We were.	Aħna konna .
I had nothing more.	Ma kelli xejn aktar.
Everyone said that.	Kulħadd qal dan.
I did exactly as I said.	Għamilt eżatt kif għedt.
We know where I was.	Nafu fejn kont.
I knew he was going to have a son every year.	Kont naf li kien se jkollu tifel kull sena.
I would like to go.	Nixtieq immur.
I don't know.	Ma nafx.
This has never really happened.	Dan fil-fatt qatt ma ġara.
Not now or never.	Mhux issa jew qatt.
Do they have money?	Għandhom flus?
Maybe, he had gone too little.	Forsi, kien mar ftit wisq.
He wanted to be both.	Ried ikun it-tnejn.
It's really good.	Huwa tassew tajjeb.
I need everyone there.	Għandi bżonn kulħadd hemm.
Some hours probably.	Xi sigħat probabbilment.
Or the same.	Jew l-istess.
That's what you're going to do.	Li int ser tagħmel.
This should help a lot.	Dan għandu jgħin ħafna.
I didn’t want this to go away.	Ma ridtx li dan jitlaq.
About many things.	Dwar ħafna affarijiet.
Nor is it good.	Lanqas huwa tajjeb.
This is easy.	Dan huwa faċli.
Which certainly wasn’t often.	Li żgur ma kienx spiss.
We want to do better.	Irridu nagħmlu aħjar.
It was hard to see.	Kien diffiċli biex tara.
This is something you don't want to do.	Din hija xi ħaġa li ma tridx tagħmel.
But nothing is easy here.	Imma xejn mhu faċli hawn.
If this works for some people, this is great.	Jekk dan jaħdem għal xi nies, dan huwa kbir.
Maybe it was good.	Forsi kien tajjeb.
But he never did anything.	Imma qatt ma għamel xejn.
I'm sure.	Jien żgur.
The, the, the.	Le, le, le.
It becomes easier.	Isir aktar faċli.
This you are for me, I am for him.	Dan int għalija, jien għalih.
I was really surprised.	Kont verament sorpriż.
.	.
She didn't know it was.	Ma kinitx taf li kienet.
Good if you don't want to talk.	Tajjeb jekk ma tridx titkellem.
I'm very happy.	Jien kuntent ħafna.
There will never be more.	Qatt mhu se jkun hemm aktar.
For me it is what is mine.	Għalija huwa dak li hu tiegħi.
I understand what's going on.	Nifhem x’qed jiġri.
He was glad he wasn’t.	Kien ferħan li ma kienx.
Not that he ever would.	Mhux li qatt kien se.
They were just the two of them now.	Kienu biss it-tnejn li huma issa.
Everyone who has come to live with us.	Kull min ġie jgħix magħna.
I said no.	Jien għedt le.
And not too often.	U mhux wisq spiss.
I don't know.	Ma nafx.
They have one car.	Għandhom karozza waħda.
But no more.	Imma mhux aktar.
And it should be.	U għandu jkun.
You are so good.	Inti daqshekk tajjeb.
She was not going to do that.	Hija ma kinitx se tagħmel dan.
He had never been so scared, not since he was a little boy.	Qatt ma kien jibża daqshekk, mhux minn meta kien tifel żgħir.
This is good of me.	Dan huwa tajjeb minni.
But he can't.	Imma ma jistax.
But nothing was done.	Imma ma sar xejn.
Everything else is easy.	Kollox ieħor huwa faċli.
Come on, now.	Ejja, issa.
As it was there was not too much wrong.	Kif kien ma kienx hemm wisq ħażin.
We are friends, which is a good thing.	Aħna ħbieb, li hija ħaġa tajba.
I came here.	Ġejt hawn.
He wanted to go to school.	Ried imur l-iskola.
Or ‘just’.	Jew 'biss'.
There was another problem.	Kien hemm problema oħra.
Better that with.	Aħjar li huwa ma '.
He thought it might help.	Huwa ħaseb li jista 'jgħin.
I have no idea how well this works.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kemm dan jaħdem tajjeb.
Everyone has these.	Kulħadd għandu dawn.
Someone has an idea why this is happening.	Xi ħadd għandu idea għaliex dan qed jiġri.
But, you know,.	Imma, taf,.
I’m sure it will be great.	Jien ċert li se jkun kbir.
But alone.	Imma waħdi.
Or it won’t.	Jew mhux se tagħmel.
I wish it wasn’t.	Nixtieq li ma kienx.
He was doing well at the time.	Dak iż-żmien kien sejjer tajjeb.
It would be the first thing anyone saw when he came here.	Tkun l-ewwel ħaġa li ra xi ħadd meta daħal hawn.
And this has now been done.	U dan issa sar.
But no, there is.	Imma le, hemm.
Not everyone can do what you do.	Mhux kulħadd jista’ jagħmel dak li tagħmel int.
Talk when you don't have to.	Titkellem meta m'għandekx.
That would work for me.	Dan ikun jaħdem għalija.
You go tonight.	Inti tmur illejla.
I never knew.	Qatt ma kont naf.
In fact, he is not driving.	Fil-fatt, mhux qed isuq.
He was right to do so.	Kien tajjeb li għamel hekk.
Now, of course, we know better.	Issa, ovvjament, nafu aħjar.
But it was more.	Imma kien aktar.
And it should be mine.	U għandu jkun l-istess tiegħi.
Maybe.	Forsi.
We must do the same.	Għandna nagħmlu l-istess.
I’m thinking of getting a job here.	Qed naħseb li nieħu xogħol hawn.
As you wish.	Kif tixtieq.
First, it was really beautiful.	L-ewwel, kienet tassew sabiħa.
I don't want to hear it.	Ma rridx nisma.
It was not so.	Ma kienx hekk.
So do you.	Hekk tagħmel dan.
Unless it is.	Sakemm ma jkunx.
I’m not going to go last.	Jien mhux se mmur l-aħħar.
Just to do it all over again.	Biss biex tagħmel dan kollu mill-ġdid.
And it can be.	U jista 'jkun.
And it can be wrong.	U jista 'jkun ħażin.
And a lot more fun.	U ħafna aktar gost.
I don’t want to be friends with you.	Ma rridx inkun ħbieb miegħek.
I just heard it recently.	Għadni kemm smajt dan l-aħħar.
It was a very difficult job.	Kien xogħol diffiċli ħafna.
I don’t know all of them.	Ma nafx kollha.
But it almost never happens.	Imma kważi qatt ma jiġri.
If you say so.	Jekk tgħid hekk.
I used to go to this school.	Jien kont immur din l-iskola.
I've never seen one before.	Qatt ma rajt waħda qabel.
He has no chance.	M’għandux ċans.
And that now.	U dak issa.
I saw how he was there.	Rajt kif kien qiegħed hemm.
There is nothing wrong with it.	M'hemm xejn ħażin miegħu.
I need help.	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna.
She knew she was beautiful.	Kienet taf li kienet sabiħa.
You don’t have to, anymore.	M'għandekx għalfejn, aktar.
Everything works so well together.	Kollox jaħdem daqshekk tajjeb flimkien.
It didn’t seem likely.	Ma deherx probabbli.
I wonder when this will happen.	Nistaqsi meta se jiġri dan.
This is pretty good.	Dan huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
There was nothing he could say.	Ma kien hemm xejn li seta’ jgħid.
I, you know.	Jien, taf.
There are some things you are never going to do.	Hemm xi affarijiet li qatt ma tmur tagħmel.
We make good money now.	Nagħmlu flus tajba issa.
He was just a boy.	Kien biss tifel.
You should do this soon.	Għandek tagħmel dan dalwaqt.
It will be one of years.	Se tkun waħda ta’ snin.
We had.	Kellna.
Nothing is ever enough.	Xejn qatt mhu biżżejjed.
He said nothing.	Ma qal xejn.
He doesn’t know better.	Ma jafx aħjar.
It's not over looked from behind.	Huwa mhux fuq ħares minn wara.
I hope it goes well.	Nispera li sejjer tajjeb.
This seems difficult.	Dan jidher diffiċli.
Go where you want to go.	Tmur fejn trid li tmur.
That could be wrong.	Li jista 'jkun ħażin.
I’m not telling you to do that.	Jien mhux qed ngħidlek tagħmel dan.
She wants to be here.	Hi trid tkun hawn.
I was just scared.	Kont biss nibża’.
She says nothing.	Hija ma tgħid xejn.
And how much.	U kemm.
You can come with me if you want.	Tista’ tiġi miegħi jekk trid.
Everyone seems to know everything about everyone.	Kulħadd jidher li jaf kollox dwar kulħadd.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha.
Like someone was waiting.	Bħal xi ħadd kien qed jistenna.
And on.	U fuq.
If you have the time, it's another thing.	Jekk għandek il-ħin, hija ħaġa oħra.
He lost his job.	Huwa tilef ix-xogħol tiegħu.
He can also speak.	Jista’ jitkellem ukoll.
It's been a while.	Ġie ftit żmien.
It doesn't have to be.	M’għandux għalfejn.
I want to be ready.	Irrid inkun lest.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
This may not be long.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx twil.
No one actually says so.	Ħadd mhu fil-fatt jgħid hekk.
Not the first to do so.	Mhux l-ewwel li jagħmel dan.
The, the, the.	Le, le, le.
You were not here.	Inti ma kontx hawn.
We are really just friends.	Aħna verament biss ħbieb.
It was beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa.
And much, much more.	U ħafna, ħafna aktar.
So good for you !!.	Hekk tajjeb għalik!!.
This is going to be great.	Dan se jkun kbir.
I'm not sure he's okay.	M'inix ċert li hu tajjeb.
But everything will be fine.	Imma kollox se jkun tajjeb.
Obviously, it may not be.	Ovvjament, jista 'ma jkunx.
I like to be helpful.	Inħobb inkun ta’ għajnuna.
That's what you do.	Huwa dak li tagħmel.
Rather.	Pjuttost.
Like now, here with you.	Bħal issa, hawn miegħek.
I thought we did a really good job.	Ħsibt li għamilna xogħol tassew tajjeb.
It was coming.	Kien ġej.
He seemed surprised.	Huwa deher sorpriż.
Maybe, after a few years, there may have been a way.	Forsi, wara ftit snin, seta’ kien hemm mod.
If I hadn’t.	Kieku ma kontx.
It may take until tomorrow.	Jista' jieħu sa għada.
I have never done any before.	Qatt ma għamilt xi qabel.
There is little more to say.	Hemm ftit aktar xi ngħid.
I can do the same thing.	Nista' nagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
There is no such thing.	M'hemm l-ebda ħaġa bħal din.
It often looks like nothing.	Ħafna drabi qisu xejn.
You have to do it.	Għandek tagħmel dan.
But we will never know.	Imma qatt ma nkunu nafu.
This could not have been easy.	Dan ma setax ikun faċli.
It was tomorrow.	Kienet għada.
I have you.	Għandi inti.
And that should be enough.	U dan għandu jkun biżżejjed.
It's good tonight.	Huwa tajjeb illejla.
It's pretty long.	Huwa pjuttost twil.
He did well.	Huwa għamel tajjeb.
Think a little more.	Taħseb ftit aktar.
After that, he would have to see.	Wara dan, kien ikollu jara.
It's hard to see.	Huwa diffiċli biex tara.
Your job, my husband.	Ix-xogħol tiegħek, raġel tiegħi.
He told me.	Huwa qalli.
It would never have been so.	Qatt ma kien ikun hekk.
There is more.	Hemm aktar.
Look, he sees nothing.	Ħares, ma jara xejn.
I never wanted you, you know.	Jien qatt ma ridt int, taf.
This is nothing like this.	Dan mhu xejn bħal dan.
This he did not know.	Dan ma kienx jaf.
the.	le.
I want you to think about it.	Irrid li taħseb dwarha.
It must be him.	Għandu jkun hu.
Each one.	Kull wieħed.
He couldn’t be happier.	Ma jistax ikun aktar kuntent.
A lot of things happened.	Ġara ħafna affarijiet.
It never did to me.	Qatt ma għamel lili.
That had to be good.	Dak kellu jkun tajjeb.
I was so scared, I really was.	Kont tant nibża, tassew kont.
I think he appeared there now.	Naħseb li deher hemm issa.
Usually one doesn’t think too much about it.	Normalment wieħed ma jaħseb wisq dwar dan.
Either you go get some help either.	Jew tmur tieħu xi għajnuna jew.
There is no better time than now.	M'hemm l-ebda ħin aħjar minn issa.
A few years.	Ftit snin.
I was too, at the time.	Jien kont ukoll, dak iż-żmien.
That’s so beautiful.	Dik hija daqshekk sabiħa.
There will always be.	Dejjem se jkun hemm.
He wants to go back there.	Irid imur lura hemm.
I did it.	Għamilt dan.
This was not going to be easy.	Dan ma kienx se jkun faċli.
I know we are friends.	Naf li aħna ħbieb.
That happened before.	Dak ġara qabel.
And nothing happens.	U ma jiġri xejn.
She was making sure.	Kienet tagħmel ċert.
That’s not a problem.	Dik mhix problema.
It came from around here.	Ġie minn madwar hawn.
I know a child will be a child.	Naf li tifel se jkun tifel.
And we both knew why.	U t-tnejn konna nafu għaliex.
But really, it’s not a bad thing.	Imma tassew, mhu xejn ħażin.
I wanted what I had.	Kont irrid dak li kellek.
I can't understand.	Ma nistax nista' nifhem.
And so it was.	U hekk kien hu.
I thought he had gone long ago.	Ħsibt li kien mar ilu.
It actually works.	Fil-fatt jaħdem.
Not for me, this was my home.	Mhux għalija, din kienet id-dar tiegħi.
Please, no more.	Jekk jogħġbok, mhux aktar.
You know what's going to happen.	Taf x’se jiġri.
It was evening.	Kien filgħaxija.
He couldn't say what it was.	Ma setax jgħid x’kien.
He was just a little boy.	Kien biss tifel żgħir.
I think we can do that.	Naħseb li nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
There is no way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod.
And it is more than that.	U huwa aktar minn hekk.
One never leaves.	Wieħed qatt ma jitlaq.
There should be a lot more.	Għandu jkun hemm ħafna aktar.
Just another year.	Sena oħra biss.
I was just a kid.	Kont biss tifel.
But for him, it was nothing.	Imma għalih, ma kien xejn.
No, it’s nothing like that.	Le, mhu xejn bħal dan.
Not one.	Lanqas wieħed.
And she is always beautiful.	U hi dejjem sabiħa.
Which is a lot.	Li huwa ħafna.
But that’s someone not me.	Imma dak xi ħadd ma jkunx jien.
But this is good too.	Imma dan huwa tajjeb ukoll.
It has happened often but not every so often.	Ġie jiġri ta’ spiss imma kull tant żmien ma jkunx hemm.
The work is not easy.	Ix-xogħol mhux faċli.
My not.	Tiegħi mhux.
And why not.	U għaliex le.
He could not go home.	Ma setax imur id-dar.
But it can't be done.	Imma ma jistax isir.
It was late afternoon.	Kien tard wara nofsinhar.
There is nothing more.	M'hemm xejn aktar.
I never did that.	Qatt ma għamilt hekk.
I think we have problems.	Naħseb li għandna problemi.
That's what happened today.	Hekk ġara llum.
What is this? 	X'inhu dan?
And this is great.	U dan huwa kbir.
You made a man of me.	Inti għamilt raġel minni.
This never happens.	Dan qatt ma jiġri.
We did this as follows.	Għamilna dan kif ġej.
This is all happening.	Dan kollu qed jiġri.
There must be someone else.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħadd ieħor.
It just makes things harder.	Huwa biss jagħmel l-affarijiet aktar diffiċli.
I need to talk to you.	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek.
I'm sure you can do that.	Jien ċert li tista 'tagħmel dan.
Well, that's easy.	Ukoll, dan huwa faċli.
But about that.	Imma dwar dan.
You're really good.	Int tassew tajjeb.
if for some.	jekk għal xi.
Too much of a good thing can be bad.	Wisq ta 'ħaġa tajba tista' tkun ħażina.
They felt good.	Ħassu tajjeb.
She was right, you know.	Kellha raġun, taf.
I think we need more than that.	Naħseb li għandna bżonn aktar minn dan.
Not too late for you now.	Mhux tard wisq għalik issa.
And there it was.	U hemm kien.
That's all there is to it.	Huwa biss dak li hu.
Well it should.	Ukoll għandu.
It does for me.	Dan jagħmel għalija.
He leaves in the morning.	Huwa jitlaq filgħodu.
Or it could be someone else altogether.	Jew jista 'jkun xi ħadd ieħor għal kollox.
But it was difficult.	Imma kien diffiċli.
I want you to speak for me.	Irrid li titkellem għalija.
There was nothing there.	Ma kien hemm xejn hemmhekk.
Not an idea.	Mhux idea.
What was he wearing when he came home?	X’kien liebes meta daħal id-dar?
That is not happening now.	Dak mhux qed jiġri issa.
He just knows.	Jaf biss.
But you don't.	Imma inti ma.
Not too much.	Mhux wisq.
It may be too late.	Jista’ jkun tard.
You said it happened a long time ago.	Inti għedt li ġara żmien twil ilu.
Something goes wrong.	Xi ħaġa tmur ħażin.
But he is.	Imma hu.
There work.	Hemmhekk ix-xogħol.
But you don’t want to do that.	Imma int ma tridx tagħmel dan.
But it was not so anymore.	Imma ma kienx hekk aktar.
When its time came.	Meta wasal iż-żmien tiegħu.
He can do almost anything.	Jista 'jagħmel kważi xejn.
No one was happy.	Ħadd ma kien kuntent.
It could be his, it could be yours.	Jista’ jkun tiegħu, jista’ jkun tiegħek.
Definitely not one on one.	Żgur mhux wieħed fuq wieħed.
No more.	Mhux aktar.
I didn’t need to know more than that.	Ma kellix bżonn inkun naf aktar minn hekk.
No one had.	Ħadd ma kellu.
It had to be good.	Kellu jkun tajjeb.
One man has a problem, one does not.	Raġel wieħed għandu problema, wieħed le.
There is no other way around this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor madwar dan.
And that was that.	U dak kien dak.
She never did much work.	Qatt ma għamlet ħafna xogħol.
You are never around anymore.	Qatt m'intix madwar aktar.
I don't need anyone.	M’għandi bżonn lil ħadd.
I'm sure there will be.	Jien ċert li se jkun hemm.
He went on.	Huwa mar fuq.
But you will.	Imma int se.
It could be this problem.	Jista 'jkun din il-problema.
It looks like a lot of fun.	Qisu gost ħafna.
It's been too long.	Ġie twil wisq.
Also, it’s not working.	Barra minn hekk, mhux qed jaħdem.
No, that was wrong too.	Le, dan kien ħażin ukoll.
This will not fit.	Dan mhux se joqgħod.
It was very easy.	Kienet faċli ħafna.
I understand, but no one can help.	Nifhem, imma ħadd ma jista’ jgħin.
I need to be here.	Għandi bżonn inkun hawn.
Which is just good.	Li huwa biss tajjeb.
How hard it is to say.	Kemm huwa diffiċli li wieħed jgħid.
I could say I wasn’t interested.	Jien stajt ngħid li ma kienx interessat.
Do you have to go?	Għandek tmur?
I can’t tell if it’s good or bad.	Ma nistax ngħid jekk hux tajjeb jew ħażin.
That should be it.	Dak għandu jkun.
No problem.	L-ebda problema.
We have to do something.	Irridu nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
I didn’t even know I was here.	Lanqas kont naf li kont hawn.
It's better if you see.	Huwa aħjar jekk tara.
It was very difficult to be here.	Kien diffiċli ħafna li tkun hawn.
You really were.	Int verament kont.
It's just enough.	Huwa biss biżżejjed.
No one has ever seen one.	Ħadd qatt ma ra wieħed.
Definitely we did.	Żgur li għamilna.
Everyone wants to play.	Kulħadd irid jilgħab.
If he had.	Kieku kellu.
How old are you?	Kemm għandek żmien?
He never goes back.	Hu qatt ma jmur lura.
And it was.	U kien.
Years.	Snin.
Only a very small one.	Biss wieħed żgħir ħafna.
It seems like I can't understand why it's not working.	Jidher li ma nistax nifhem għaliex mhux qed jaħdem.
And all that there is.	U dak kollu li hemm.
I have never heard of such a thing.	Qatt ma smajt bħal dan.
Everything else is still here.	Kull ħaġa oħra għadha hawn.
She had to know everything.	Kellha tkun taf kollox.
I want everyone to have something for tomorrow.	Irrid li kulħadd ikollu xi ħaġa għal għada.
You will not do this.	Inti mhux se tagħmel dan.
I'm nothing.	Jien xejn.
I can’t believe he went.	Ma nistax nemmen li mar.
Do you think you can do anything !.	Taħseb li tista' tagħmel xi ħaġa!.
, le.	, le.
It looks like nothing is going to work out.	Jidher li xejn mhu sejjer.
For you it may not be.	Għalik jista 'ma jkunx.
She was beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa.
He never knew.	Hu qatt ma kien jaf.
So have we.	Hekk għandna aħna.
You should too.	Għandek ukoll.
No one will come.	Ħadd mhu se jiġi.
For me doing this must be wrong.	Għalija nagħmel dan għandu jkun ħażin.
Not long now.	Mhux twil issa.
For some time now.	Għal xi żmien issa.
Plus I did well.	Barra minn hekk għamilt tajjeb.
Better on some things.	Aħjar fuq xi affarijiet.
He is not there.	Hu mhux hemm.
No one came.	Ħadd ma ġie.
I have to believe he is.	Irrid nemmen li hu.
It was home.	Kienet id-dar.
So much the more.	Tant aktar.
But that was not always the case.	Imma mhux dejjem kienu hekk.
Well, not so.	Ukoll, mhux hekk.
They were on top of that.	Kienu fuq fuq hemmhekk.
I didn't listen all the time.	Il-ħin kollu ma kontx nisma’.
I really don’t know why.	Verament ma nafx għaliex.
Maybe we do, maybe not.	Forsi nagħmlu, forsi le.
No one knew this.	Ħadd ma kien jaf dan.
Someone like.	Xi ħadd bħal.
They are both tired.	It-tnejn huma għajjien.
That time.	Dak il-ħin.
Here it is.	Hawn hi.
But he was already ready.	Imma kien diġà lest.
All well and good.	Dak kollu tajjeb u tajjeb.
But not easy.	Imma mhux faċli.
Time to do something.	Żmien li tagħmel xi ħaġa.
Better late than never!	Aħjar tard milli qatt!
It’s time for him.	Wasal iż-żmien għalih.
You're a boy.	Int tifel.
In fact, everything is.	Fil-fatt, kollox huwa.
Everyone knew he was going to be there.	Kulħadd kien jaf li kien se jkun hemm.
He never lost his job.	Hu qatt ma tilef ix-xogħol.
I want to take some time to talk to you.	Irrid nagħmel ftit ħin biex nitkellem miegħek.
To talk to you.	Biex nitkellem miegħek.
I'm here tomorrow.	Jien hawn għada.
Something wrong.	Xi ħaġa ħażina.
But if.	Imma jekk.
It is not enough.	Mhuwiex biżżejjed.
We are not what they are after.	Aħna mhux dak li huma wara.
I never did that at home.	Jien qatt ma kont nagħmel hekk id-dar.
Now you know where you are.	Issa taf fejn int.
I did the same.	Jien għamilt l-istess.
But it is happening.	Imma qed jiġri.
It could have been someone.	Seta’ kien xi ħadd.
You go with him.	Inti tmur miegħu.
Whatever you want.	Tkun xi tkun tixtieq.
Everything will be fine.	Kollox se jkun tajjeb.
You're ready.	Int lest.
I think you will.	Naħseb li inti se.
Maybe he should go.	Forsi għandu jmur.
I was listening.	Kont nisma’.
This is what you need.	Dan huwa dak li għandek bżonn.
I would be too.	Inkun ukoll.
Surely there had to be something there.	Żgur li kellu jkun hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
Both of us would.	It-tnejn li aħna kieku.
I can't speak now.	Ma nistax nitkellem issa.
But there is never anything else.	Imma qatt ma hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
And if you don't.	U jekk ma tagħmilx hekk.
I knew you were making one.	Kont naf li qed tagħmel waħda.
There can be no such thing.	Ma jistax ikun hemm ħaġa bħal din.
But she was home.	Imma kienet id-dar.
He could do it all.	Huwa seta 'jagħmel dan kollu.
We are so.	Aħna hekk.
And we just made friends.	U aħna biss għamilna ħbieb.
He is trying hard.	Huwa qed jipprova ħafna.
Probably never, actually.	Probabbilment qatt, fil-fatt.
But I try.	Imma nipprova.
It probably was.	Probabbilment kien.
I'm here.	Jien qiegħed hawn.
He was thinking about something like that too.	Kien qed jaħseb dwar xi ħaġa bħal din ukoll.
Really, we know.	Tassew, nafu.
That’s what we’re about and we do it right.	Dan huwa dak li aħna qed dwar u nagħmlu dan tajjeb.
It will not work.	Mhux se jaħdem.
It will be great.	Se jkun kbir.
I think he’s there.	Naħseb li qiegħed hemm.
Me and me and me and me.	Jien u jien u jien u jien.
But maybe it's something else.	Imma forsi hija xi ħaġa oħra.
I'll talk to you about that later.	I ser nitkellem miegħek dwar dan aktar tard.
He had never done so before.	Qatt ma kien għamel hekk qabel.
It was the only way.	Kien l-uniku mod.
It wasn't beautiful.	Ma kinitx sabiħa.
He was not afraid of anyone.	Ma kien daqsxejn jibża’ minn ħadd.
No, it was more than that.	Le, kien aktar minn hekk.
But now, there is nothing.	Imma issa, m'hemm xejn.
You are all alone.	Inti kollha waħdek.
Usually not much.	Normalment mhux ħafna.
Everything happened too fast.	Kollox ġara malajr wisq.
I need to hear this.	Għandi bżonn nisma dan.
If that's what you want.	Jekk dak hu li trid.
Maybe better than that.	Forsi aħjar minn hekk.
Being back is great.	Li tkun lura huwa kbir.
Can you tell me.	Tista’ tgħidli.
Everyone here does something.	Kulħadd hawn jagħmel xi ħaġa.
There must be a better way.	Għandu jkun hemm mod aħjar.
But it was much more than that.	Imma kien ħafna aktar minn hekk.
It was just one of many.	Kien biss wieħed minn ħafna.
No one was saying anything.	Ħadd ma kien jgħid xejn.
Just a boy, actually.	Biss tifel, fil-fatt.
It is not an easy task.	Mhix xogħol faċli.
How tired I am.	Kemm jien għajjien .
It wasn’t a chance.	Ma kienx ċans.
But no one knows how many.	Imma ħadd ma jaf kemm hu.
It's a big problem.	Hija problema kbira.
No no it can't be.	Le le ma jistax ikun.
As soon as you are well.	Hekk kif tkun tajjeb.
I have never seen one like this before.	Qatt ma rajt waħda bħal dik qabel.
I had no one to go to.	Ma kellix ma’ min immur.
That, we.	Li, aħna.
I can’t really be with him and do a lot.	Ma nistax verament inkun miegħu u nagħmel ħafna.
I think maybe that’s what’s wrong with me.	Naħseb li forsi huwa dak li hu ħażin miegħi.
There weren’t many people outside.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna nies barra.
And that could be.	U li jista 'jkun.
We know little but not enough.	Nafu ftit imma mhux biżżejjed.
That's not bad.	Dak mhux ħażin.
And there is more.	U hemm aktar.
Nice thing, he thought.	Ħaġa sabiħa, ħaseb.
Not that we do that.	Mhux li nagħmlu hekk.
I am now alone.	Jien issa waħdi.
Not what it was after.	Mhux dak li kien wara.
I've never been here before.	Qatt ma kont hawn qabel.
But he won't.	Imma hu mhux se.
It’s never good enough.	Qatt mhu tajjeb biżżejjed.
I’m not entirely sure how we do it, but it’s there.	M'inix ċert għal kollox kif nagħmlu, imma qiegħed hemm.
I wanted to sit down and think a little.	Ridt noqgħod bilqiegħda u naħseb ftit.
The work is busy here.	Ix-xogħol huwa okkupat hawn.
She always did.	Hija dejjem għamlet.
I never heard back.	Qatt ma smajt lura.
He is always talking.	Huwa dejjem jitkellem.
I have no problem talking about it.	M'għandi l-ebda problema nitkellem dwarha.
I don’t want to be difficult.	Ma rridx inkun diffiċli.
It was something.	Kienet xi ħaġa.
It's nara.	Se nara.
It's too late in the morning.	Huwa tard wisq filgħodu.
I’ve never been one to do that.	Qatt ma kont wieħed li nagħmel dan.
I don’t know anything like that.	Jien ma naf xejn bħal dan.
This is it.	Dan hu.
And they often do.	U spiss jagħmlu.
Not now, not yet.	Mhux issa, għadu mhux.
They really were.	Kienu tassew.
That's a good one.	Dik hija waħda tajba.
I think you’ll have a lot of fun.	Naħseb li int ser tieħu gost tassew.
This is where you go.	Dan huwa fejn inti tmur.
Someone else came.	Daħal xi ħadd ieħor.
I never do that.	Qatt ma nagħmel hekk.
And maybe he knows how it was going.	U forsi jaf kif kien sejjer.
Not the same thing.	Mhux l-istess ħaġa.
I understand, no problem.	Nifhem, l-ebda problema.
First and foremost.	L-ewwel u l-uniku.
It won't be good.	Mhux se jkun tajjeb.
They currently have one person.	Għandhom persuna waħda bħalissa.
Definitely worth a try.	Żgur li min jipprova.
It does nothing for you.	Ma tagħmel xejn għalik.
We did it before.	Għamilna qabel.
Not on this.	Mhux fuq dan.
There is no easy way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod faċli.
I was ready.	I kien lest.
And that’s saying something.	U dak qed jgħid xi ħaġa.
He didn’t want to be there anymore.	Ma riedx ikun hemm aktar.
But there is no way to actually do that.	Imma m'hemm l-ebda mod kif fil-fatt tagħmel dan.
That’s what we need.	Dak hu li għandna bżonn.
This has never happened before.	Dan qatt ma ġara qabel.
Today, not tomorrow.	Illum, mhux għada.
He never was.	Hu qatt ma kien.
This is easy.	Dan huwa faċli.
So are they.	Hekk ukoll huma.
Sometimes that works.	Xi drabi dak jaħdem.
This will come back when you're back.	Dan jerġa 'jiġi meta int lura.
Which I don't.	Li jien ma.
That was all he could do.	Kien dak kollu li seta’ jagħmel.
This was so bad for him.	Dan kien tant ħażin għalih.
He never took it.	Hu qatt ma ħa.
I thought this was where it was supposed to be.	Ħsibt li dan kien fejn suppost kellu jkun.
And it happens.	U dan jiġri.
Definitely not his.	Żgur li mhux tiegħu.
It was a bad one.	Kienet waħda ħażina.
Good to go.	Tajjeb li tmur.
I’ve seen too much, actually.	Rajt wisq, fil-fatt.
That they often did.	Li spiss kienu jagħmlu.
This does well.	Dan jagħmel tajjeb.
That's what you have to do.	Dak hu li għandek tagħmel.
We need to do something.	Għandna bżonn nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
All that really is.	Dak kollu li verament hu.
I think it was just time.	Naħseb li kien biss wasal iż-żmien.
That's all I said.	Hekk għidt biss.
It will definitely come.	Żgur li se jiġi.
I didn’t make mine.	Mhux għamilt tiegħi.
Everything is happening too fast.	Kollox qed jiġri malajr wisq.
It is not.	Mhuwiex.
You can take any one you want.	Tista 'tieħu kull wieħed li trid.
But he was not doing that.	Imma ma kienx jagħmel dan.
But if you tell someone, you know what will happen.	Imma jekk tgħid lil xi ħadd, taf x’se jiġri.
He was probably living alone.	Probabbilment kien jgħix waħdu.
It seemed a long time.	Deher żmien twil.
Today, it looks like it never happened.	Illum, qisu qatt ma ġara.
That's an idea.	Dik hija idea.
I want you to think about tomorrow.	Irrid li taħseb dwar għada.
Maybe that was my problem.	Forsi kienet il-problema tiegħi.
He was really scared.	Huwa verament kien jibża.
Tomorrow do another.	Għada tagħmel ieħor.
He never had.	Qatt ma kellu.
It was easy to do.	Kien faċli li tagħmel.
That was the first one for me.	Dik kienet l-ewwel waħda għalija.
This can take a very long time.	Dan jista 'jieħu żmien twil ħafna.
But only here.	Imma hawn biss.
One is not too good.	Wieħed mhux tajjeb wisq.
He did this often.	Huwa għamel dan spiss.
Now was the time.	Issa kien iż-żmien.
You knew it was her.	Kont taf li kienet hi.
You know what happened.	Taf li ġara.
I'm sure you'll be fine.	Jien ċert li inti tkun tajjeb.
It's almost nothing.	Huwa kważi xejn.
A man came quickly.	Raġel daħal malajr.
Few people are.	Ftit nies huma.
This is a big problem.	Din hija problema kbira.
Much better.	Ħafna aħjar.
Maybe who she was.	Forsi min kienet.
Sorry for that.	Jiddispjaċini għal dan.
I was there too.	Jien kont qiegħed hemm ukoll.
I’m sure actually.	Jien ċert fil-fatt.
I said it was good, and it was.	Għidt li kien tajjeb, u kien.
I was going to school.	Kont sejjer l-iskola.
There has to be someone sitting on things.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħadd bilqiegħda fuq l-affarijiet.
Probably never.	Probabbilment mhux qatt.
It's not really what it's about.	Mhuwiex verament dak li huwa dwar.
Enough has already happened.	Diġà ġara biżżejjed.
With someone, really.	Ma’ xi ħadd, tassew.
I was, of course, too young to be there.	Jien, ovvjament, kont żgħir wisq biex kont hemm.
I don’t think he ever went back after that.	Ma naħsibx li qatt mar lura wara dak.
It could have happened to anyone.	Seta’ ġara lil xi ħadd.
It must be you.	Għandu jkun int.
There was nothing there.	Ma kien hemm xejn hemmhekk.
We are not.	Aħna mhux.
It could be anything.	Jista 'jkun xejn.
Getting there easy.	Wasal hemm faċli.
Not when you think about it.	Mhux meta taħseb dwarha.
There was not much to talk about.	Ma tantx kien hemm xi titkellem.
That's easy to say.	Dan huwa faċli li tgħid.
But almost everything goes now.	Imma kważi kollox imur issa.
With a little, too.	Bi ftit, ukoll.
To each of his.	Lil kull wieħed tiegħu.
He didn’t want to think about it.	Ma riedx jaħseb dwar dan.
What was he talking about?	X’kien qed jitkellem.
Definitely not good.	Żgur li mhux tajjeb.
That was mine now.	Dan kien tiegħi issa.
And there it was.	U hemm kien.
Try it !.	Ipprova!.
We are all.	Aħna kollha .
He didn’t want to do that.	Ma riedx li tagħmel dan.
But you are very good.	Imma int tajjeb ħafna.
He is like everyone else.	Huwa bħal kulħadd.
Everyone was still at home.	Kulħadd kien għadu d-dar.
I don't know when.	Ma nafx meta.
It was so hard.	Kien daqshekk diffiċli.
Someone was there.	Xi ħadd kien hemm.
Of what it never had, and now it never will.	Ta’ dak li qatt ma kellha, u issa qatt ma se.
I can and will.	Jien nista u se.
That could be so, of course.	Dan jista 'jkun hekk, ovvjament.
Or not.	Jew le.
I’m actually trying to do the same thing.	Fil-fatt qed nipprova nagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
You don’t need that.	M'għandekx bżonn dak.
You can do it at home, people.	Tista' tagħmel dan id-dar, nies.
Maybe so it should be.	Forsi hekk għandu jkun.
Just a little.	Ftit biss.
But almost only.	Imma kważi biss.
Do you think there will be anything left ?.	Taħseb li se jibqa' xi ħaġa?.
It's fast.	Huwa malajr.
I didn't know what happened.	Ma kontx naf x’ġara.
And I’ve heard about it before.	U smajt dwar dan qabel.
He can't stay still.	Ma jistax jibqa’ qiegħed.
No one had ever done so before.	Ħadd qatt ma kien għamel hekk qabel.
He thought about it.	Huwa ħaseb dwar dan.
Really, we did.	Tassew, għamilna.
She was going too fast for him.	Kienet tmur malajr wisq għalih.
This was early in the morning.	Dan kien kmieni filgħodu.
I’m not a lot of people.	Jien mhux ħafna nies.
He could see that.	Huwa seta 'jara li.
There will be none of that.	Mhu se jkun hemm xejn minn hekk.
Probably waiting.	Probabbilment jistenna.
I don’t expect it.	Jien ma nistenna.
He could never really say no more.	Hu qatt ma seta’ verament jgħid, mhux aktar.
No one knew where he was.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn kien.
I’m not sure about that.	M'inix ċert dwar dan.
It doesn’t look good.	Ma jidhirx tajjeb.
To tell the truth, this is not the first time.	Biex ngħid il-verità, din mhix l-ewwel darba.
It takes an older man.	Jeħtieġ raġel ta’ aktar snin.
Not even for hours.	Lanqas għal sigħat.
Now you know why.	Issa taf għaliex.
I’m almost there actually.	Jien kważi hemm fil-fatt.
It was just.	Kien biss.
I had done it another year.	Kont għamilt sena oħra.
She is a good boy.	Hija tifel tajjeb.
Obviously your home is yours.	Ovvjament id-dar tiegħek hija tiegħek.
Why are you so scared?	Għaliex tant jibża?
He is ready.	Huwa lest.
I'm sorry you're not happy today.	Jiddispjaċini li llum m'intix kuntent.
I would like that too.	Nixtieq hekk ukoll.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
He shouldn’t have been surprised.	Huwa ma kellux ikun sorpriż.
For all that was it.	Għal dak kollu li kien dan.
As much as you want.	Kemm trid.
None of that happened.	Xejn minn hekk ma ġara.
He knew there was another.	Kien jaf li kien hemm ieħor.
We could do a lot of things if we had more money.	Nistgħu nagħmlu ħafna affarijiet, kieku kellna aktar flus.
This may not be enough.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx biżżejjed.
She did a good job.	Hija għamlet xogħol tajjeb.
It shouldn’t take long.	M'għandux jieħu ħafna żmien.
Something is happening here.	Qed jiġri xi ħaġa hawn.
He thinks you are alone.	Jaħseb li int waħdek.
I didn’t want this for you.	Ma ridtx dan għalik.
I was so tired.	Kont tant għajjien.
If you really want to, you will.	Jekk verament trid, int se.
What will you see? 	X'se tara?
It won’t be anymore.	Mhux se jkun aktar.
I think you go.	Naħseb li tmur.
I'll be back in a few hours.	Ser inkun lura fi ftit sigħat.
You don't take anything.	Inti ma tieħu xejn.
Everyone was busy, but someone was going to be with him soon.	Kulħadd kien okkupat, imma xi ħadd kien se jkun miegħu dalwaqt.
It was, of course, much more than that.	Kien, ovvjament, ħafna aktar minn hekk.
And so on.	U hekk.
No one knew what to say next.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x'għandu jgħid wara.
It probably was for everyone.	Huwa probabbilment kien għal kulħadd.
It couldn’t have been better.	Ma setax ikun aħjar.
Hours of fun.	Sigħat ta’ gost.
Everything seems to be going well.	Jidher li kollox sejjer tajjeb.
I'm too busy today.	Jien okkupat wisq illum.
But never like this.	Imma qatt bħal dan.
Something happened.	Ġara xi ħaġa.
Now she knew better.	Issa kienet taf aħjar.
Or something you might think.	Jew xi ħaġa li tista 'taħseb.
This is working fine.	Dan qed jaħdem tajjeb.
But that was enough.	Imma dan kien biżżejjed.
I believe I am too.	Jien nemmen li jien ukoll.
None of this is going well.	Xejn minn dan ma jmur tajjeb.
You must have done this before.	Int trid tkun għamilt dan qabel.
It's there all morning.	Hemm filgħodu kollu.
You're a little friend.	Int ħabib żgħir.
I have never thought about this before.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan qabel.
Sorry for that.	Jiddispjaċini għal dan.
I have never seen anything like it.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din.
Don't try anything.	Ma jipprova xejn.
I moved recently.	Jien mort dan l-aħħar.
It could have been something or someone.	Seta’ kien xi ħaġa jew xi ħadd.
That’s not what you do.	Dak mhux dak li tagħmel.
He knew he had to leave.	Kien jaf li kellu jitlaq.
I want some.	Irrid xi ftit.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
I wasn't sure who to talk to first.	Ma kontx ċert ma’ min nitkellem l-ewwel.
Now, if that’s what you want to say, fine.	Issa, jekk dak hu li trid tgħid, tajjeb.
I never buy there.	Jien qatt ma nixtri hemmhekk.
I spent a year there.	Għamilt sena hemmhekk.
This could not be happening.	Dan ma setax qed jiġri.
No, more and more now.	Le, aktar u aktar issa.
We need to do something.	Għandna bżonn nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
On top of that.	Fuq minn hekk.
I had to do it alone.	Kelli nagħmel dan waħdi.
But of course, it came.	Imma ovvjament, wasal.
I can believe that.	Jien nista' nemmen li.
I couldn’t tell.	Ma stajtx ngħid.
One big big big one.	Wieħed kbir kbir kbir.
That would be the only way.	Dak ikun l-uniku mod.
That was tomorrow.	Dak kien għada.
He’s a good man, really good.	Huwa raġel tajjeb, tajjeb tassew.
He had no idea for how long.	Ma kellux idea għal kemm żmien.
Someone has some idea of ​​what is going on.	Xi ħadd għandu xi idea ta' x'qed jiġri.
And a lot of work.	U ħafna xogħol.
He is telling the truth.	Qed jgħid il-verità.
Now we know why.	Issa nafu għaliex.
She was a boy.	Kienet tifel.
Or it could be.	Jew jista 'jkun.
But that was good enough.	Imma dan kien tajjeb biżżejjed.
There was no need to say anything.	Ma kien hemm bżonn li tgħid xejn.
This currently works.	Dan jaħdem bħalissa.
Everything went well until morning.	Kollox mar tajjeb sa filgħodu.
I would really like to see this.	Nixtieq verament nara dan.
She had each of these.	Kellha kull wieħed minn dawn.
The house looks really big.	Id-dar tidher tassew kbira.
I'm going now.	Jien issa sejjer.
I think this is just great.	Naħseb li dan huwa biss kbir.
You have to do something about it.	Għandek tagħmel xi ħaġa dwar dan.
Here's something wrong.	Hawn xi ħaġa ħażina.
It could have been there.	Seta’ kien hemm.
I’m pretty sure it should be the last.	Jien pjuttost ċert li għandu jkun l-aħħar.
He knew what was going on.	Kien jaf x’kien hemm.
I'm not listening.	Jien mhux nisma.
It’s not that hard to do.	Mhuwiex daqshekk diffiċli li tagħmel.
I don’t know why he did that too.	Ma nafx għaliex għamel hekk ukoll.
He is ready to go.	Huwa lest li jmur.
You see it's bad enough.	Tara huwa ħażin biżżejjed.
He took it badly.	Huwa ħa ħażin.
From there I came.	Minn hemm ġejt.
And it works pretty well.	U jaħdem pjuttost tajjeb.
I hope it was good for you too.	Nispera li kien tajjeb għalik ukoll.
And maybe he's right.	U forsi għandu raġun.
It could be wrong.	Jista 'jkun ħażin.
This may or may not be good.	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb, jista' ma jkunx.
And nothing is more certain.	U xejn mhu aktar ċert.
I tell you.	Ngħidlek.
Much of this work is now complete.	Ħafna minn dan ix-xogħol issa huwa lest.
Everyone wants to do better.	Kulħadd irid jagħmel aħjar.
Or maybe not everyone knows this.	Jew forsi kulħadd ma jafx dan.
You seem to be right.	Jidher li għandek raġun.
You’re a tiny little man.	Int raġel żgħir żgħir.
He didn't know anymore.	Ma kienx jaf aktar.
I have to go.	Ikolli mmur.
Everyone knows everything.	Kulħadd jaf kollox.
There is no right or wrong.	M'hemm l-ebda tajjeb jew ħażin.
Not bad for not doing much.	Mhux ħażin li ma tagħmilx ħafna.
And of course, so it is.	U ovvjament, hekk hu.
It was better she had to go.	Kien aħjar li kellha tmur.
What happened once happened again.	Dak li ġara darba jerġa’ jiġri.
If it came out.	Jekk ħareġ.
And what someone needs.	U dak li xi ħadd jeħtieġ.
But there is nothing I could do.	Imma m'hemm xejn li stajt tagħmel.
The school was out.	L-iskola kienet barra.
That's just me.	Dak jien biss.
I can't take this anymore!	Ma nistax nieħu dan aktar!
I knew she was back.	Kont naf li tkun lura.
It was just the time.	Kien biss iż-żmien.
He knew everything he needed to know.	Kien jaf dak kollu li kellu bżonn ikun jaf.
You'll tell me either way.	Inti ser tgħidli jew mod.
You can't go wrong with doing this.	Ma tistax tmur ħażin meta tagħmel dan.
He has a young son.	Għandu tifel żgħir.
He never had and never will.	Qatt ma kellu u qatt ma se.
It looks great.	Huwa jidher kbir.
I think there is something good.	Naħseb li hemm xi ħaġa tajba.
Too big for me.	Kbir wisq għalija.
I know better now.	Naf aħjar issa.
Neither do you.	U lanqas int.
Say no.	Tgħid le.
I just can’t believe it.	Jien biss ma nistax nemmen.
She knows she can.	Hija taf li tista '.
That can't be good.	Li ma jistax ikun tajjeb.
I can't wait any longer.	Ma nistax nistenna aktar.
It's something he could never do.	Hija xi ħaġa li hu qatt ma jista 'jagħmel.
This work must be completed by tomorrow.	Dan ix-xogħol irid ikun lest sa għada.
What he is doing, no one else is doing it.	Dak li qed jagħmel, ħadd ieħor mhu qed jagħmel dan.
You will be out.	Int tkun barra.
I wanted both.	Ridt it-tnejn.
And there was something else about it, too.	U kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra dwarha, ukoll.
I think you can’t do that.	Naħseb li ma tistax tagħmel dan.
No one has ever said otherwise.	Ħadd qatt ma qal mod ieħor.
But it will not live long.	Imma mhux se jgħix twil.
Maybe too much.	Forsi wisq.
I'll do it again.	Jien nerġa' nagħmel.
I know nothing.	Jien ma naf xejn.
It won’t be a problem for me.	Mhux se jkun problema għalija.
There was no time to eat.	Ma kienx hemm ħin biex tiekol.
Nothing like this happens.	Ma jiġri xejn bħal dan.
It was a good account.	Kien kont tajjeb.
I doubt it will happen.	Niddubita li se jiġri.
He is my friend.	Huwa ħbieb tiegħi.
That he had enough money to not need to work anymore.	Li kellu biżżejjed flus biex ma kellux bżonn jaħdem aktar.
I would be more than ready.	Inkun aktar minn lest.
And it really is.	U huwa tassew.
There were too many.	Kien hemm wisq.
He knows nothing about anything.	Ma jaf xejn dwar xejn.
That’s what we did.	Dak għamilna.
It was evening now.	Issa kien filgħaxija.
But that seems like a hard thing to do.	Imma tidher li hija ħaġa diffiċli li tagħmel.
I’ve never been there, not even once.	Qatt ma kont hemm, lanqas darba.
Good is good.	Tajjeb huwa tajjeb.
I go to school.	Immur l-iskola.
And now, here we go.	U issa, ejja hawn.
But first.	Imma l-ewwel.
That’s a lot for me.	Dak huwa ħafna għalija.
I just know, that’s all.	Naf biss, huwa kollox.
Just one of many problems.	Waħda biss minn ħafna problemi.
He said so quickly.	Huwa qal hekk malajr.
That was for sitting down.	Dak kien għal bilqiegħda.
He got there soon.	Wasal hemm dalwaqt.
Just that it was a bad time for me.	Biss li kien żmien ħażin għalija.
You do what you need to do.	Inti tagħmel dak li għandek bżonn tagħmel.
He wanted to do more than that.	Ried jagħmel aktar minn hekk.
I had to go to the back door.	Kelli mmur lejn il-bieb ta’ wara.
And it should be.	U għandu jkun.
I was just here.	Jien kont hawn biss.
He sees me.	Huwa jara lili.
But not just work.	Imma mhux biss xogħol.
So it was supposed to be.	Hekk suppost kellha tkun.
You can come here.	Tista’ tiġi hawn.
He knew it was going to be hard for him to do that.	Kien jaf li kien se jkun diffiċli għalih li jagħmel dan.
It’s just school.	Hija biss l-iskola.
At a time like this, too.	Fi żmien bħal dan, ukoll.
I want him to be happy.	Jien irrid li jkun kuntent.
But he wasn’t the only one.	Imma ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
Need help with this.	Bżonn għajnuna ma 'dan.
These were things he knew.	Dawn kienu affarijiet li kien jaf.
They were really, really hard.	Kienu tassew, tassew diffiċli.
It also appeared.	Deher ukoll.
I had to sit there and wait.	Kelli noqgħod hemm u nistenna.
Nobody knows.	Ħadd ma nafu.
We know nothing about where he is from.	Ma nafu xejn dwar minn fejn hu.
You're out now.	Int hawn barra issa.
I can't tell you right now.	Ma nistax ngħidlek bħalissa.
I never liked it.	Qatt ma kont inħobb.
You are for a while.	Inti għal ftit żmien.
I think she knows something.	Naħseb li hi li taf xi ħaġa.
This is not easy.	Dan ma jkunx faċli.
But he said nothing to anyone.	Imma ma qal xejn lil ħadd.
It will definitely go back.	Żgur se tmur lura.
But so it happened.	Imma hekk ġara.
She just wants to talk.	Hija trid biss titkellem.
Now you want to eat.	Issa trid tiekol.
He didn't know she was going to do that.	Ma kienx jaf li kienet se tagħmel hekk.
I need to know how he did it.	Għandi bżonn inkun naf kif għamel dan.
And if it takes more than.	U jekk dan jieħu aktar minn .
There is so much more you can do.	Hemm ħafna aktar li tista 'tagħmel.
More than that.	Aktar minn hekk.
Time had passed so quickly.	Iż-żmien kien għadda daqshekk malajr.
Something bad will happen.	Se jiġri xi ħaġa ħażina.
You can do more than that.	Tista 'tagħmel aktar minn hekk.
Something.	Xi ħaġa.
He would be a friend for a long time to come.	Kien ikun ħabib għal żmien twil li ġej.
He still lives there.	Għadu jgħix hemm.
It was just everything.	Kien biss kollox.
Want some?	Trid xi ftit?
I'll tell you when.	Jien ngħidlek meta.
In fact, it is good to do so.	Fil-fatt, huwa tajjeb li tagħmel hekk.
So bad.	Hekk hi ħażina.
It doesn’t seem to be working.	Ma jidhirx li qed jaħdem.
I hadn’t thought about it.	Jien ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan.
He was right to be.	Kellu raġun li jkun.
And so easy to do.	U daqshekk faċli biex tagħmel.
She was not there.	Hija ma kinitx hemm.
It’s time to go further.	Wasal iż-żmien li mmorru aktar.
There is no right or wrong way.	L-ebda mod mhu tajjeb jew ħażin.
She needed to be alone.	Hija kellha bżonn tkun waħedha.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
So it goes.	Hekk imur.
I know this is a great year for me.	Naf li din hija sena kbira għalija.
He thought he had done it.	Huwa ħaseb li kien għamel dan.
I'm sure so few.	Jien ċert li tant ftit.
I say no, it doesn’t.	Jien ngħid le, ma tagħmilx.
And whoever it is, you say.	U min jista’ jkun, tgħid.
It has to happen, it will happen, it is happening.	Għandu jiġri, se jiġri, qed jiġri.
It was something else.	Kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
For many it was too little.	Għal ħafna kien ftit wisq.
That was a lot.	Dak kien ħafna.
I heard it.	Smajt jien.
Things were better for everyone when she was here.	L-affarijiet kienu aħjar għal kulħadd meta kienet hawn.
You really are supposed to know this.	Int verament suppost tkun taf dan.
There she is!	Hemm hi!
Good year.	Sena tajba.
They are difficult.	Huma diffiċli.
I have other problems.	Għandi problemi oħra.
Everything here has been and is.	Kollox hawn kien u huwa.
Too many people.	Wisq nies.
No one had, as far as he knew.	Ħadd ma kellu, sa fejn kien jaf hu.
I was thinking about it.	Kont qed naħseb dwarha.
Just in the room.	Biss fil-kamra.
We have to go back.	Irridu mmorru lura.
She certainly wouldn't.	Żgur li ma kinitx se.
But not for a while.	Imma mhux għal xi żmien.
I know how.	Jien inkun naf kif.
That was great.	Dan kien kbir.
This is a big problem.	Din hija problema kbira.
Just too much work.	Biss wisq xogħol.
Another great thing to do.	Ħaġa oħra kbira li tagħmel.
Nobody wants to stay here.	Ħadd ma jrid jibqa’ hawn.
We have to go!	Irridu mmorru!
Three years early.	Tliet snin kmieni.
If not, try these.	Jekk le, ipprova dawn.
There better be.	Hemm aħjar li jkun.
That's not great.	Dak mhux kbir.
Try it.	Ipprova.
There is nothing wrong with me.	M'hemm xejn ħażin miegħi.
She is with you.	Hi miegħek.
Everything that was expected to happen was not.	Dak kollu li kien jistenna li jiġri ma kienx.
It is now much easier to do.	Issa huwa ħafna aktar faċli li tagħmel.
What you need is what you need.	Dak li għandek bżonn huwa dak li għandek bżonn.
It wasn’t, of course.	Ma kienx, ovvjament.
But this should not be.	Imma dan m'għandux ikun.
But as he looked, he began to see something more.	Imma hekk kif ħares, beda jara xi ħaġa aktar.
I'm glad to hear that.	Jien ferħan li nisma' dan.
I hope this helps.	Nittama li dan jgħin.
Obviously this is not working.	Ovvjament dan mhux qed jaħdem.
I had no idea who or where I was going.	Ma kellix idea ta’ min jew fejn se mmur.
That's not good.	Dak mhux tajjeb.
We don't.	Aħna ma.
Nobody knows.	Ħadd ma nafu.
You can't go outside.	Ma tistax tmur barra.
And it shouldn’t.	U m'għandux.
You can't do that.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan.
Maybe not all.	Forsi mhux kollu.
They were people once, just a very long time ago.	Kienu nies darba, biss żmien twil ħafna ilu.
Maybe he had gone too fast.	Forsi kien mar malajr wisq.
That was great.	Dan kien kbir.
Very very very difficult.	Diffiċli ħafna ħafna.
He was a boy.	Kien tifel.
I mean, not quite.	Jien ngħid, mhux pjuttost.
I know, I don’t either.	Naf, jien lanqas.
The problem is that this is not working.	Il-problema hija li dan mhux qed jaħdem.
If anyone can, you can.	Jekk xi ħadd jista’, int.
It turned out badly.	Ħareġ ħażin.
I did well.	Għamilt tajjeb.
He actually does.	Huwa fil-fatt jagħmel.
The work had taken longer than he thought.	Ix-xogħol kien ħa aktar milli ħaseb.
I'm single.	Jien wieħed.
He couldn’t ask for more.	Ma setax talab aktar.
I could only hope it wasn’t ours.	Stajt nittama biss li ma kienx tagħna.
Not so now.	Issa mhux hekk.
She did more of these things.	Hija għamlet aktar minn dawn l-affarijiet.
He wanted to do that.	Ried jagħmel dan.
The car was still there.	Il-karozza kienet għadha hemm.
No, it doesn't have to.	Le, m'għandux għalfejn.
There must be a way.	Għandu jkun hemm mod.
I’m not saying it’s bad.	Mhux qed ngħid li huwa ħażin.
He knew, not me.	Hu kien jaf, mhux jien.
That's what we do.	Hekk nagħmlu aħna.
Or almost everyone.	Jew kważi kulħadd.
I just can’t go there right now.	Jien biss ma nistax immur hemm bħalissa.
Maybe so and maybe not.	Forsi hekk u forsi le.
I would like to talk to you.	Nixtieq nitkellem miegħek.
I don’t even believe it.	Jien lanqas nemmen.
He didn't need one.	Ma kellux bżonn wieħed.
You need both.	Għandek bżonn it-tnejn.
Or so it seemed, sometimes.	Jew hekk deher, xi drabi.
Why should.	Għaliex għandu.
He was doing it.	Kien jagħmel dan.
Alone you.	Waħdek int.
There is something else.	Hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
I need to tell you everything.	Għandi bżonn ngħidlek kollox.
It wasn’t, and it couldn’t.	Ma kienx, u ma setax.
Let me try this.	Ħa nipprova dan.
It was really happening.	Kien verament qed jiġri.
And that one is probably wrong as well.	U dak wieħed x'aktarx huwa ħażin ukoll.
I was not happy about that.	Ma kontx kuntent b’dan.
But it will be too late.	Imma se jkun tard wisq.
But you have to.	Imma int għandek.
You come with me.	Inti tiġi miegħi.
It’s not always a good thing.	Mhux dejjem hija ħaġa tajba.
Just work.	Biss ix-xogħol.
I am very happy for you.	Jien kuntent ħafna għalik.
I thought it might be.	Ħsibt li jista 'jkun.
To each other.	Lil xulxin.
Most people do this.	Ħafna nies jagħmlu dan.
And that’s not for you to say.	U dan mhux għalik li tgħid.
Maybe a good idea.	Forsi idea tajba.
Surely you know.	Li żgur taf.
This early in the morning.	Dan kmieni filgħodu.
There was no need to be.	Ma kienx hemm bżonn li jkun.
He had come together before.	Huwa kellu daħal flimkien qabel.
I had too much.	Kont kelli wisq.
It sure is.	Huwa żgur.
We did well today.	Għamilna tajjeb illum.
She knew nothing about it.	Ma kienet taf xejn dwarha.
I don't have much time this afternoon.	M’għandix ħafna ħin illum wara nofsinhar.
I'm glad to be here.	Jien kuntent li nkun hawn.
That would be too much.	Li tkun wisq.
But not able to do that.	Imma mhux kapaċi jagħmlu dan.
There is so much more!	Hemm ħafna aktar!
You are not worried.	M'intix inkwetat.
But not so here.	Imma mhux hekk hawn.
And maybe we are.	U forsi aħna.
But maybe not as difficult as it seems.	Imma forsi mhux daqshekk diffiċli kif jidher.
Not that he thought he would.	Mhux li ħaseb li kieku.
I want more things to do for him.	Irrid aktar affarijiet li jagħmlu dan għalih.
If they do, great.	Jekk jagħmlu hekk, kbir.
I don’t think it’s easy.	Ma naħsibx li huwa faċli.
She knew that.	Hija kienet taf li.
I was there when he died.	Jien kont hemm meta miet.
And there is more.	U hemm aktar.
You are eating.	Qed tiekol.
But we don't.	Imma m’għandniex.
I have to stay.	Ikolli noqgħod.
I believe you are so good.	Nemmen li int daqshekk tajjeb.
He had thought of nothing more for years.	Huwa kien ħaseb għal xejn aktar għal snin.
That was not all.	Dan ma kienx kollox.
To do this, you need to know who he is.	Biex tagħmel dan, trid tkun taf min hu.
He is not here.	Hu mhux hawn.
I had never been so before.	Qatt ma kont hekk qabel.
And it all happened quickly.	U kollox ġara malajr.
She knew for a long time that it was going to happen.	Kienet taf għal żmien twil li kien se jiġri.
Nor was it my idea.	Lanqas ma kienet idea tiegħi.
And she had done that.	U kienet għamlet dan.
I really thought about it.	Verament ħsibt dwarha.
But it wasn’t.	Imma ma kienx.
He was quite glad he had it with him.	Kien pjuttost ferħan li kellu miegħu.
He can't see.	Ma jistax jara.
Sorry for all this, you know.	Jiddispjaċini għal dan kollu, taf.
It was something we did.	Kienet xi ħaġa li għamilna.
It’s just not all work.	Huwa biss mhux ix-xogħol kollu.
It seemed to be going on forever.	Deher li sejjer għal dejjem.
That says a lot.	Dan jgħid ħafna.
But he says nothing.	Imma ma jgħid xejn.
Look at what they do.	Ħares lejn dak li jagħmlu.
He really had it all.	Huwa verament kellu dan kollu.
But we are just friends.	Imma aħna biss ħbieb.
I know too much.	Naf wisq.
No, he wasn’t worried.	Le, ma kienx inkwetat.
It just doesn't happen.	Huwa biss ma jiġri.
I always do that.	Jien dejjem nagħmel hekk.
Or he had made time.	Jew kien għamel il-ħin.
Well, pretty much.	Ukoll, pjuttost ħafna.
And you can.	U tista’.
Everything had gone well a few hours ago.	Kollox kien mar tajjeb ftit sigħat ilu.
No, you have to go.	Le, għandek tmur.
If you had any idea.	Kieku kellek xi idea.
He was always such a good boy.	Dejjem kien tifel daqshekk tajjeb.
I get to think really about other people here, not just me.	Ikolli naħseb verament dwar nies oħra hawn, mhux biss jien.
This happens.	Dan jiġri.
Well, for years, maybe never.	Ukoll, għal snin, forsi qatt.
No one else came.	Ħadd ieħor ma ġie.
It is more than that.	Huwa aktar minn hekk.
He was always happy to help.	Dejjem kien ferħan li jgħin.
A few years, maybe more.	Ftit snin, forsi aktar.
It wasn’t you.	Ma kontx int.
It looked bad.	Deher ħażin.
It was too big for one person.	Kien kbir wisq għal persuna waħda.
It was already late in the afternoon.	Kien diġà tard wara nofsinhar.
Until once he did.	Sakemm darba hekk għamel.
All the time.	Il-ħin kollu.
Like today.	Bħal illum.
He must eat.	Huwa għandu jiekol.
He was right about that.	Huwa kellu raġun dwar dan.
Not us or they are.	Mhux aħna jew huma.
Definitely saw it.	Żgur li rajt.
There was something going on outside.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa jiġri barra.
Now, you're done.	Issa, int lest.
To do something is to do nothing.	Li tagħmel xi ħaġa hija ma tagħmel xejn.
And she’s better than good.	U hi aħjar milli tajba.
There was only one person who could be.	Kien hemm persuna waħda biss li jista 'jkun.
But look at everything that happened.	Imma ħares lejn dak kollu li ġara.
It was almost out.	Kien kważi barra.
Well, mine was, well.	Ukoll, tiegħi kien, ukoll.
It looks like it won’t be anytime soon.	Jidher li mhux se jkun dalwaqt.
I think you see where this is going.	Naħseb li tara fejn sejjer dan.
It was a long time ago.	Kien żmien twil ilu.
They felt ready for anything.	Ħassu lest għal kull ħaġa.
But never this.	Imma qatt dan.
I don’t think so.	Jien mhux naħseb.
That's right, another.	Hekk hu, ieħor.
But he is not so busy.	Imma hu mhux daqshekk okkupat.
I'm sure it will do well.	Jien ċert li se tagħmel tajjeb.
I would be fine now.	Inkun tajjeb issa.
You are only speaking the truth.	Inti titkellem biss il-verità.
I'll be right there.	Jien inkun hemm eżatt.
He was glad he could help.	Kien ferħan li seta’ jgħin.
This happened late in the afternoon.	Dan ġara tard wara nofsinhar.
Everything else did.	Kull ħaġa oħra għamlet.
It will be here.	Se jkun hawn.
And this is not easy.	U dan mhux faċli.
I stay there for hours.	Jien noqgħod hemm għal sigħat.
And if you don't know.	U jekk le tkun taf.
Maybe it won't happen again.	Forsi mhux se jerġa’ jiġri.
He was right about that.	Huwa kellu raġun dwar dan.
I hope they are right.	Nispera li għandhom raġun.
I thought she was talking about me, but she wasn’t.	Ħsibt li kienet qed titkellem minni, imma ma kinitx.
You can talk to almost anyone.	Tista' titkellem ma' kważi kulħadd.
Not so much.	Mhux daqshekk.
It doesn’t help much.	Ma tantx jgħin.
Not back to being as fast as it was before.	Mhux lura biex tkun malajr kif kien qabel.
Everything was going to be fine.	Kollox kien se jkun tajjeb.
She does this often.	Hija tagħmel dan spiss.
Lots of problems.	Ħafna problemi.
I don't know what that is all about.	Ma nafx x’inhu dak kollu.
I'm the dog.	Jien il-kelb.
It’s getting easier now.	Qed isir aktar faċli issa.
It probably wasn’t coming.	Probabbilment ma kienx ġej.
In fact, it may be happening faster than we know.	Fil-fatt, jista 'jkun qed jiġri aktar malajr milli nafu.
I had to do.	I kellha tagħmel.
Now he knew he wanted something more.	Issa kien jaf li ried xi ħaġa aktar.
He was thinking, quickly.	Kien qed jaħseb, malajr.
The problem was that he couldn’t tell.	Il-problema kienet li ma setax jgħid.
You did very well.	Int għamilt tajjeb ħafna.
As she never did.	Kif qatt għamlet.
There are too many.	Hemm wisq.
Maybe you’re not happy any other time.	Forsi m'intix kuntent xi ħin ieħor.
He should know that by now.	Huwa għandu jkun jaf li sa issa.
He said it was too much.	Qal li kien wisq.
It is working well now.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb issa.
This is our home out here.	Din hija d-dar tagħna hawn barra.
Some other time.	Xi żmien ieħor.
But it looks good to me.	Imma jidher tajjeb għalija.
I think you should think about that.	Naħseb li għandek taħseb fuq dan.
I couldn’t do anything.	Ma stajt nagħmel xejn.
And that's it.	U dak hu li.
A boy he had with him.	Tifel li kellu miegħu.
You are not there yet.	Għadek m'intix hemm.
I didn’t even see that coming.	Dik lanqas ma rajt ġej.
Try to think.	Jipprova jaħseb.
Or tomorrow.	Jew għada.
Please come with us.	Jekk jogħġbok ejja magħna.
I am wrong.	Jiena ħażin.
We had too much.	Kellna wisq.
He had come out.	Huwa kien ħareġ.
It was nothing like this.	Ma kien xejn bħal dan.
He will do it.	Huwa se jagħmel dan.
Can that car go faster?	Tista' dik il-karozza tmur aktar malajr?
But he knew it.	Imma dan kien jaf.
I'm sure he does.	Jien ċert li jagħmel.
I have never done such a thing.	Qatt ma kont tagħmel ħaġa bħal din.
There is a better way.	Hemm mod aħjar.
He couldn’t do that for much longer.	Huwa ma setax jagħmel dan għal ħafna aktar.
But not everyone was so happy about it.	Imma mhux kulħadd kien daqshekk kuntent b’dan.
But that’s really for later.	Imma dak huwa verament għal aktar tard.
But we don’t have time now.	Imma m'għandniex ħin issa.
Sorry, you can't do that.	Jiddispjaċini, ma tistax tagħmel dan.
They are.	Dawn huma.
That's for what.	Dak għal dak.
No, it was pretty bad.	Le, kien pjuttost ħażin.
No one usually was.	Ħadd normalment ma kien.
He can do better.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel aħjar.
He died.	Miet.
You must have done a lot of work to do this.	Int trid tkun għamilt ħafna xogħol biex tagħmel dan.
But it's too late.	Imma huwa tard wisq.
He said he would.	Qal li kieku.
He could wait.	Seta’ jistenna.
Not every idea is a good one.	Mhux kull idea hija waħda tajba.
And there were some, of course.	U kien hemm xi, ovvjament.
Everything was ready.	Kollox kien lest.
I didn’t want that.	Ma ridtx dan.
He should know.	Għandu jkun jaf.
For all this.	Għal dan kollu.
But he has to wait.	Imma jrid jistenna.
He seemed very worried.	Huwa deher inkwetat ħafna.
Now it’s too much.	Issa huwa wisq.
Obviously, he didn’t.	Ovvjament, ma kellux.
Like nothing happened.	Bħal ma ġara xejn.
He said it was good.	Qal li kien tajjeb.
Everything was fine.	Kollox kien tajjeb.
He seems to want to have.	Jidher li jrid ikollu.
Surprise is good.	Sorpriż huwa tajjeb.
He said he didn't even know why.	Qal li lanqas biss kien jaf għaliex.
I didn’t know when you were going to appear.	Ma kontx naf meta int se tidher.
I did nothing wrong.	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin.
I’ve been here before.	Jien kont hawn qabel.
I can’t take more than that.	Ma nistax nieħu aktar minn dan.
They are doing a lot lately.	Dan dan l-aħħar qed jagħmlu ħafna.
We do work for you.	Nagħmlu xogħol għalik.
This is easy.	Dan huwa faċli.
But it could have been there.	Imma seta’ kien hemm.
I saw someone.	Rajt xi ħadd.
It just happens.	Huwa biss jiġri.
Well it wasn’t.	Ukoll ma kienx.
He never took it.	Qatt ma ħa.
I want you to know for sure.	Irrid li tkun taf li żgur.
He wants to live with you forever.	Irid jgħix miegħek għal dejjem.
Before he died.	Qabel ma miet.
But we did.	Imma għamilna.
A person cannot be anything he wants.	Persuna ma tistax tkun xi ħaġa li trid.
This we knew.	Dan konna nafu.
I didn’t know how to do that.	Ma kontx naf kif nagħmel dan.
But she had to.	Imma kellha.
It's not that easy.	Mhuwiex daqshekk faċli.
Every year, work, work.	Kull sena, xogħol, xogħol.
Not you.	Mhux int.
Someone had to tell the truth about what happened.	Xi ħadd kellu jgħid il-verità dwar dak li ġara.
I died about to see the last one.	I madwar miet nara l-aħħar wieħed.
She is a child only.	Hija tifel biss.
It would be better for everyone.	Ikun aħjar għal kulħadd.
It’s not really my thing.	Mhuwiex verament ħaġa tiegħi.
I won’t go back that far.	Mhux se mmur lura daqshekk.
This was still happening.	Dan kien għadu jiġri.
Not much more.	Mhux wisq aktar.
There it is done.	Hemmhekk isir.
He never did.	Qatt ma kien jagħmel.
It seems like I have a lot to say.	Jidher li għandi ħafna xi ngħid.
Everything was not right.	Kollox ma kienx tajjeb.
No, really scared.	Le, verament jibża.
And we had a good time.	U kellna żmien tajjeb.
We never know.	Qatt ma nafu.
But it was not so.	Imma ma kienx hekk.
It was much better there.	Kien ħafna aħjar hemmhekk.
And now, so was she.	U issa, hekk kienet hi.
You are not well.	M'intix tajjeb.
You moved into your room.	Inti mort fil-kamra tiegħek.
And make some money.	U tagħmel xi flus.
That’s definitely happening here.	Dak żgur li qed jiġri hawn.
But something else.	Imma xi ħaġa oħra.
I didn’t know.	Ma kontx taf.
Things were just that.	L-affarijiet kienu biss.
Maybe you know.	Forsi taf.
That’s the only time.	Dik hija l-unika darba.
He didn’t want to tell anyone.	Ma ried jgħid lil ħadd.
Which is more out there than you might think.	Li hija aktar barra milli inti tista 'taħseb.
And all this can wait.	U dan kollu jista’ jistenna.
I hope he does.	Nispera li jagħmel.
What it was, yet.	Dak li kien, għadu.
He is not eating.	Mhux qed jiekol.
I've never been here before.	Qatt ma kont hawn qabel.
My friend was very helpful.	Ħabib tiegħi kien ta’ għajnuna kbira.
He told me no one was interested.	Huwa qalli ħadd ma kien interessat.
He went further than that.	Mar aktar minn hekk.
And he says you’re still here.	U jgħid li għadek hawn.
I try something once.	Nipprova xi ħaġa darba.
You just need to be you.	Għandek bżonn biss li tkun int.
We know how it looks.	Nafu kif wieħed jidher.
Which is too bad.	Li huwa ħażin wisq.
I wanted to say more.	Ridt ngħid aktar.
If she was, she would do more with me.	Kieku kienet, kienet tagħmel aktar miegħi.
You can't, of course, do that.	Inti ma tistax, ovvjament, tagħmel dan.
He had done this before.	Huwa kien għamel dan qabel.
Maybe we are.	Forsi aħna.
No, she was taking a chance.	Le, kienet tieħu ċans.
I have a big car.	Għandi karozza kbira.
I’m not sure how to do that.	M'inix ċert kif nagħmel dan.
That's not the case.	Dak mhux hekk.
No one seems happy.	Ħadd ma jidher kuntent.
He went back and left.	Huwa mar lura u telaq.
He never came.	Hu qatt ma ġie.
Anyone can say that.	Kulħadd jista’ jgħid hekk.
It’s like that with everyone.	Hija bħal dik ma 'kulħadd.
You're better than me.	Int aħjar minni.
I shouldn’t ask.	M'għandix nistaqsi.
It's just great.	Huwa biss kbir.
I'm telling the truth.	Qed ngħid il-verità.
I'm so scared.	Jien tant nibża.
But he wanted more than that.	Imma ried aktar minn hekk.
No one knew we were there.	Ħadd ma kien jaf li konna hemm.
I wanted to say.	Ried ngħid.
Nothing was happening.	Ma kien qed jiġri xejn.
But how to do it.	Imma kif jagħmlu dan.
It's so easy !.	Huwa daqshekk faċli!.
It comes from outside.	Huwa ġej minn barra.
I really didn't want anything more.	Verament ma ridt xejn aktar.
I never said that, ever, after you told me so.	Qatt ma għidt hekk, qatt, wara li qalli hekk.
Everything is nothing.	Kollox mhu xejn.
It's easy to talk like that.	Huwa faċli li titkellem hekk.
Whatever happens, everyone knows about it.	Kull ħaġa li jiġri, kulħadd jaf dwarha.
You want to do it today.	Trid tagħmel dan illum.
Please someone come.	Jekk jogħġbok xi ħadd jiġi.
In fact, very, very often.	Fil-fatt, ħafna, ħafna drabi.
Things you want to know.	Affarijiet li trid tkun taf.
Pretty glad to be back.	Pjuttost ferħan li ġej lura.
I'm not a morning person.	Jien mhux persuna ta’ filgħodu.
It’s just going to happen more.	Huwa biss se jiġri aktar.
I thought there was something.	Ħsibt li kien hemm xi ħaġa.
It had been many years since he had been alone.	Kien ilu ħafna snin li kien ilu waħdu.
One came out yesterday.	Wieħed ħareġ ilbieraħ.
If you.	Se int.
He had thought about it.	Huwa kien ħaseb dwarha.
He had no problems.	Ma kellux problemi.
That was a little too much.	Dan kien ftit wisq.
I can be.	Jien nista' nkun.
I want to talk about something else.	Irrid nitkellem dwar xi ħaġa oħra.
Good and bad.	Tajjeb hu u mhux.
I already do.	Jien diġà nagħmel.
In a few years that would be me.	Fi ftit snin dak inkun jien.
But that's not what he says.	Imma dan mhux dak li jgħid.
And he won’t do that.	U mhux se jagħmel dan.
I believe he will be able to.	Nemmen li jkun kapaċi.
This was not to happen.	Dan ma kellux jiġri.
It says a lot.	Jgħid ħafna.
I talk a lot with him.	Jien nitkellem ħafna miegħu.
I want that now.	Irrid li issa.
That’s still not good, but apparently it was good enough.	Dak għadu mhux tajjeb, imma milli jidher kien tajjeb biżżejjed.
There is only.	Hemm biss.
It’s not bad as everyone says.	Hu mhux ħażin kif jgħid kulħadd.
I'll try that.	Jien ser nipprova hekk.
Nobody really wants to do that.	Ħadd ma jrid verament jagħmel dan.
But that is not enough for us.	Imma dan mhux biżżejjed għalina.
It is his home.	Huwa d-dar tiegħu.
It's not hard.	Mhuwiex diffiċli.
For him, and for me.	Għalih, u għalija.
Here try these.	Hawn ipprova dawn.
Which is good.	Li huwa tajjeb.
About many things.	Dwar ħafna affarijiet.
I have nothing to tell you.	M'għandix xi ngħidlek.
You may have made a few friends here.	Int forsi għamilt ftit ħbieb hawn.
She did it.	Hija għamlet dan.
There, she was alone.	Hemmhekk, kienet waħedha.
Someone wants to.	Xi ħadd irid.
And he knows it was bad too.	U jaf li kien ħażin ukoll.
But no one knows any of this.	Imma ħadd ma jaf xejn minn dan.
Nothing can ever be feared.	Xejn qatt ma jista’ jibża’.
I didn’t even know you had a car.	Lanqas kont naf li kellek karozza.
He just can't.	Huwa biss ma jistax.
But it is still early.	Imma għadu kmieni.
Everyone had something to say about it.	Kulħadd kellu xi jgħid dwarha.
There were three problems with this.	Kien hemm tliet problemi ma 'dan.
Everyone should know this.	Kulħadd għandu jkun jaf dan.
When you’re so young, you want to.	Meta tkun daqshekk żgħir, trid.
It wouldn’t be so bad.	Ma jkunx daqshekk ħażin.
I will go back.	Se mmur lura.
You need more.	Għandek bżonn aktar.
But he was definitely scared.	Imma żgur li kien jibża’.
As far as you go.	Kemm tmur.
He really didn’t want to be here.	Huwa tassew ma riedx ikun hawn.
I doubt everything now.	Niddubita kollox issa.
For a while.	Għal xi żmien.
Thing is in the room with us.	Ħaġa hija fil-kamra magħna.
It must be difficult.	Għandu jkun diffiċli.
I'm going home.	Jien sejjer id-dar.
I'll be talking to a man soon.	Dalwaqt inkun qed nitkellem ma’ raġel.
I think he’s the only one.	Naħseb li hu l-uniku wieħed.
But there is one problem.	Imma hemm problema waħda.
I can't.	Ma nistax.
Probably the last.	Probabbilment l-aħħar.
That would never have happened.	Dak qatt ma kien jiġri.
', was'.	', kien '.
Maybe nothing was.	Forsi xejn ma kien.
I think I wasn’t there.	Naħseb li ma kontx hemm.
In doing so, it’s great.	Meta jagħmlu dan, huwa kbir.
Just a little.	Ftit biss.
It has never been done before.	Qatt ma sar qabel.
This has only happened once.	Dan ġara darba biss.
There will be no problems.	Mhux se jkun hemm problemi.
He may be back by now.	Huwa jista 'jkun lura sa issa.
There is nothing he can do now.	M'hemm xejn li jista 'jagħmel issa.
Well, maybe we are.	Ukoll, forsi aħna.
I'm better now.	Jien aħjar issa.
I like to listen.	Inħobb nisma’.
Everything looked good.	Kollox deher tajjeb.
The work was not easy.	Ix-xogħol ma kienx faċli.
I can’t do much.	Ma nistax nagħmel ħafna.
That's it, isn't it.	Dak hu, hux.
The faster you do it, the better.	Aktar ma tagħmel dan malajr, aħjar.
This is very big.	Dan huwa kbir ħafna.
I was there and I did.	Jien kont hemm u għamilt hekk.
And they are.	U huma.
Now do so.	Issa jagħmel hekk.
But she never did anything wrong.	Imma qatt ma għamlet xejn ħażin.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Forsi, forsi, forsi.
So I say.	Hekk ngħid.
A little, maybe more.	Ftit, forsi aktar.
I need help.	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna.
But he is.	Imma hu.
I really hope she does.	Verament nittama li hi tagħmel.
I don’t know why it wasn’t.	Ma nafx għaliex ma kienx.
I can go back to school.	Nista’ mmur lura l-iskola.
Now it will soon be better.	Issa dalwaqt se jkun aħjar.
I didn’t want to do that.	Jien ma ridtx nagħmel hekk.
I’m happy for him, really.	Jien kuntent għalih, tassew.
No, maybe better not.	Le, forsi aħjar le.
I had no idea what was going on.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'qed jiġri.
Often, in fact.	Ħafna drabi, fil-fatt.
He left.	Huwa telaq.
I was ready now.	Jien kont lest issa.
You must want to do this.	Trid trid tagħmel dan.
This should work well enough, and it does.	Dan għandu jaħdem tajjeb biżżejjed, u jagħmel hekk.
He wants to survive.	Irid jgħix.
Maybe we should.	Forsi għandna.
He knew she was right.	Kien jaf li kellha raġun.
But she had to go.	Imma kellha tmur.
Look around a bit.	Ħares ftit madwar.
Everyone was talking.	Kulħadd kien qed jitkellem.
You want to talk to.	Trid titkellem ma.
More than enough actually.	Aktar minn biżżejjed fil-fatt.
She didn't know who he was.	Ma kinitx taf min kien.
It wouldn’t work without it.	Ma kienx jaħdem mingħajr dan.
There are many things.	Hemm ħafna affarijiet.
There was much more.	Kien hemm ħafna aktar.
But it also belonged to someone else.	Imma kien ukoll ta’ xi ħadd ieħor.
Not so much anymore.	Mhux daqshekk aktar.
To appear.	Biex tidher.
I love this house.	Inħobb din id-dar.
I’m willing to be friends.	Jien lest li nkun ħbieb.
I thought I was someone else.	Ħsibt li kont xi ħadd ieħor.
Not for everyone.	Mhux għal kulħadd.
Don't be late.	Tkunx tard.
It has never been done before.	Qatt ma sar qabel.
And that is enough.	U dan huwa biżżejjed.
Please tell.	Għid jekk jogħġbok.
Or so it seemed.	Jew hekk deher.
I don’t know if it’s ever been done before.	Ma nafx jekk qatt sar qabel.
Not that, either.	Mhux dak, lanqas.
It's everything and more.	Huwa kollox u aktar.
You can't be mine.	Inti ma tistax tkun tiegħi.
It would be better if you didn't.	Ikun aħjar jekk inti ma.
For one thing.	Għal ħaġa.
I did both.	Għamilt it-tnejn.
Don't tell me anything.	Ma tgħidli xejn.
Just me.	Jien biss.
It's been too long.	Kien ilu wisq.
Who we were.	Min konna.
I do so.	Jien nagħmel hekk.
It was not likely.	Ma kienx probabbli.
She wants to be.	Hija trid tkun.
You don’t have to, you know.	M'għandekx għalfejn, taf.
It’s not great but it works well for me.	Mhuwiex kbir imma jaħdem tajjeb għalija.
I will not be here again.	Mhux se nkun hawn aktar.
But it never was.	Imma qatt kien hekk.
But there is such a problem.	Imma hemm problema bħal din.
I just had to do it.	Kelli biss nagħmel dan.
I didn’t even go.	Jien lanqas mort.
I really want this more than anything.	Jien verament irrid dan aktar minn kull ħaġa.
You weren’t there.	Inti ma kontx hemm.
In fact I know that.	Fil-fatt naf li.
And he doesn’t know.	U ma jafx.
Seeing something is wrong.	Li tara xi ħaġa hija ħażina.
There was something else, too.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
Try it, it really did.	Ipprova, tassew għamel.
This is beautiful.	Din hija sabiħa.
As far as you want to go.	Kemm trid tmur.
Everything should be working now.	Kollox għandu jkun qed jaħdem issa.
It's not so bad.	Hija mhix daqshekk ħażina.
But it looks like you're sitting down a little.	Imma qisu qed bilqiegħda ftit.
Definitely want to know.	Żgur li trid tkun taf.
I can do better.	Nista’ nagħmel aħjar.
That was not what really happened.	Dan ma kienx dak li verament ġara.
You do both.	Inti tagħmel it-tnejn.
About where you were and where you plan to go.	Dwar fejn kont u fejn qed tippjana li tmur.
he wanted to know.	ried ikun jaf.
I know exactly where she is.	Naf eżatt fejn hi.
He was not a boy.	Ma kienx tifel.
No one else had said so.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien qal hekk.
This was not going to work.	Dan ma kienx se jaħdem.
He was not very happy.	Ma tantx kien kuntent.
Really, it makes things easier.	Tassew, tagħmel l-affarijiet aktar faċli.
I can’t see why it’s not working here.	Ma nistax nara għaliex mhux qed jaħdem hawn.
It will not be a problem.	Mhux se tkun problema.
And there is no one else.	U m'hemm ħadd ieħor.
I don’t want things from other people.	Ma rridx affarijiet minn nies oħra.
It's enough.	Huwa biżżejjed.
That was a long time ago.	Dak kien ilu żmien twil.
No one seemed too worried about it.	Ħadd ma deher inkwetat wisq dwar dan.
This book looks like such a great idea.	Dan il-ktieb qisu idea hekk kbira.
That went well.	Li mar tajjeb.
You are on these things.	Inti fuq dawn l-affarijiet.
He couldn't help it.	Ma setax ma.
You'll know soon.	Dalwaqt tkun taf.
I didn’t even know they were there.	Lanqas kont naf li kienu hemm.
I only heard about it yesterday.	Smajt dwarha biss ilbieraħ.
Good to be back.	Tajjeb li tkun lura.
I have seen it before.	Rajt qabel.
All this was very good and everyone was happy.	Dan kollu kien tajjeb ħafna u kulħadd kien kuntent.
I don’t know why or when.	Ma nafx għaliex jew meta.
It was all the same for us.	Kien kollu l-istess għalina.
I need to be there.	Għandi bżonn inkun hemm.
I came back to that alone.	Ġejt lura għal dak biss.
It would have been small.	Kien ikun żgħir.
I was pretty busy.	Jien kont pjuttost okkupat.
Big problem.	Problema kbira.
I didn’t think you would be interested.	Ma kontx naħseb li inti tkun interessat.
You may not want to be.	Inti tista 'ma tridx tkun.
And they are for you.	U dawn huma għalik.
It was better there.	Kien aħjar hemmhekk.
But there was nothing to see.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn x’tara.
For a while.	Għal ftit.
But she didn’t, and she knew it.	Imma ma kinitx, u kienet taf.
I have it with me.	Jien għandi miegħi.
I hope you are right.	Nispera li għandek raġun.
It turned out well.	Ħareġ tajjeb.
Good on me.	Tajjeb minni.
It was too busy for us.	Kien okkupat wisq għalina.
Come on, we will be late.	Ejja, se nkunu tard.
I won’t say no.	Jien mhux se ngħid jekk le.
It could be so much better.	Jista 'jkun ħafna aħjar.
It is a big problem.	Hija problema kbira.
This would not be difficult to do.	Dan ma jkunx diffiċli li tagħmel.
One chance, that was it.	Ċans wieħed, dak kien.
Come on.	Ejja u.
I’m not telling myself.	Jien mhux qed ngħid lili.
Bad, very bad.	Ħażin, ħażin ħafna.
That was him a year ago.	Dan kien hu sena ilu.
He was out for a while, too.	Huwa kien barra għal xi żmien, ukoll.
He will.	Huwa se.
That wasn't him.	Dak ma kienx hu.
I would be ready.	Jien inkun lest.
But obviously not.	Imma ovvjament mhux.
They are just two.	Huma t-tnejn biss.
Or he doesn't want to know.	Jew ma tantx ikun irid ikun jaf.
There is everything there.	Hemm kollox hemm.
I have no better.	M'għandix aħjar.
Not everyone can do that.	Mhux kulħadd jista’ jagħmel dan.
It would not have been so.	Ma kienx ikun hekk.
There is no way to tell until it is too late.	M'hemm l-ebda mod biex tgħid sakemm ikun tard wisq.
But now was not the time to go back.	Imma issa ma kienx iż-żmien biex lura.
And I did the only thing I knew how to do.	U għamilt l-unika ħaġa li kont taf tagħmel.
He said it well.	Huwa qal tajjeb.
But only a few.	Imma ftit biss.
He was still alone.	Kien għadu waħdu.
I just wanted to know how I was doing today.	Ridt biss inkun naf kif kont sejjer illum.
I heard that.	Smajt dak.
But he knows nothing of it.	Imma hu ma jaf xejn minn dan.
It was a harder job than he had expected.	Kienet xogħol aktar diffiċli li kien jistenna.
It was a good one.	Kienet waħda tajba.
He couldn't tell.	Ma setax jgħid.
More than you want!	Aktar milli trid!
I'm not home.	Jien mhux id-dar.
If you don’t want to, you shouldn’t.	Jekk ma tridx, m'għandekx.
In fact, it was my job.	Fil-fatt, kien ix-xogħol tiegħi.
It was the last time he came.	Kienet l-aħħar darba li daħal.
So I did.	Hekk għamilt.
I hope this helps.	Nispera li dan jgħin.
I was still in school.	Kont għadni l-iskola.
No one seems to know the truth.	Ħadd ma jidher li jaf il-verità.
He has been here before.	Huwa kien hawn qabel.
What happened is this.	Dak li ġara huwa dan.
More on who he was.	Aktar dwar min kien.
Work is not for tomorrow.	Ix-xogħol mhux għal għada.
Not enough to.	Mhux biżżejjed biex .
It didn’t want to happen.	Ma riedx jiġri.
You have something else.	Għandek xi ħaġa oħra.
It just takes time.	Huwa biss jeħtieġ ħin.
That was for sure.	Dak kien żgur.
I don’t want to go back to school.	Ma rridx immur lura l-iskola.
He thought no one else could do it.	Ħaseb li ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jagħmel dan.
I can go where you can't.	Nista’ mmur fejn tista’ ma tkunx.
I'm not sure.	M'inix ċert.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.	M'għandekx għalfejn titkellem dwarha jekk ma tridx.
This is you.	Dan int.
Never again.	Mhux qatt aktar.
Not that week.	Mhux dik il-ġimgħa.
What is it ?.	X'inhu?.
You have to do what you have to do.	Int trid tagħmel dak li għandek tagħmel.
He did so.	Hekk għamel.
He has no money.	M’għandux flus.
I can’t tell you what will happen.	Ma nistax ngħidlek x'se jiġri.
It can’t be fast enough for me.	Ma jistax jiġi malajr biżżejjed għalija.
You don’t have to do everything.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel kollox.
All too well.	Kollox tajjeb wisq.
I told everyone.	għidt lil kulħadd.
Now he wasn’t just a man.	Issa ma kienx biss raġel.
He will be here.	Hu ser ikun hawn.
But that's great if.	Imma dak huwa kbir jekk.
But she was here now.	Imma hi kienet hawn issa.
That should be enough.	Dan għandu jkun biżżejjed.
Everyone wants some money!	Kulħadd irid ftit flus!
I'm not sure how this should work.	M'inix ċert kif dan għandu jaħdem.
This was not the case.	Dan ma kienx hekk.
I say.	Ngħid.
Good job.	Xogħol tajjeb.
Very quickly.	Malajr ħafna.
It was not there.	Ma kienx hemm.
I don’t think anyone really does.	Ma naħsibx li xi ħadd verament jagħmel.
This is where everything goes wrong.	Dan huwa fejn kollox imur ħażin.
Now it's done.	Issa sar.
But this was never for him.	Imma dan qatt ma kien għalih.
Maybe that was all.	Forsi dak kollu kien.
It doesn’t seem that way today.	Ma jidhirx li llum.
I hope to come soon.	Nispera li tiġi dalwaqt.
But it's too late.	Imma huwa tard wisq.
I do that.	Jien nagħmel hekk.
But there is more.	Imma hemm aktar.
He didn't have to.	Huwa ma kellux.
This is the first problem.	Din hija l-ewwel problema.
No one is what it seems.	Ħadd mhu dak li jidher.
I should be.	I għandu jkun.
From each other.	Minn xulxin.
There is something else, too.	Hemm xi ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
He wanted home.	Ried id-dar.
Not then, he thought.	Mhux dak iż-żmien, ħaseb.
Was it the same for you?	Kien l-istess għalik?
And in fact it is quite difficult.	U fil-fatt huwa pjuttost diffiċli.
It’s actually pretty good.	Huwa fil-fatt pjuttost tajjeb.
Way back when.	Mod lura meta.
Not mine, not ever.	Mhux tiegħi, mhux qatt.
I definitely don’t need both.	Żgur li m'għandix bżonn it-tnejn.
It is working properly.	Qed jaħdem kif suppost.
He didn’t have to, but he did.	Ma kellux, imma hekk għamel.
Pretty long in fact.	Żmien pjuttost twil fil-fatt.
He didn't tell anyone where he was going.	Ma qal lil ħadd fejn kien sejjer.
But that’s still not what you want.	Imma dak għadu mhux dak li trid.
It is not enough.	Mhuwiex biżżejjed.
He has to leave and he has to leave now.	Għandu jitlaq u għandu jitlaq issa.
If it happens, it happens.	Jekk jiġri, jiġri.
Glad.	Ferħan.
I have to say.	Ikolli ngħid.
I don’t know when that time will come.	Ma nafx meta se jasal dak iż-żmien.
We were able to do a lot.	Konna kapaċi nagħmlu ħafna.
It was so good tonight.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb illejla.
He said.	Hu qal.
He works on.	Huwa jaħdem fuq.
Nobody knew exactly what he was going to do.	Ħadd ma kien jaf eżatt x’kien se jagħmel.
I wasn’t happy about it.	Ma kontx kuntent dwar dan.
I don’t need the job so much.	M'għandix bżonn ix-xogħol daqshekk.
A lot of people were there for me.	Ħafna nies kienu hemm għalija.
You have to do it.	Trid tagħmel dan.
He is often tired when he is late.	Huwa spiss għajjien meta jkun tard.
I would say, not quite.	Jien ngħid, mhux pjuttost.
I'm sure of it.	Jien ċert minn dan.
I have never done anything like this.	Qatt ma għamilt xi ħaġa bħal din.
I went back to the car.	Mort lura lejn il-karozza.
And so it does.	U hekk jagħmel.
I had to do well.	Kelli nagħmel tajjeb.
He says he doesn't, but he does.	Jgħid li ma jagħmilx hekk, imma hekk.
He was still waiting to speak.	Kien għadu jistenna li titkellem.
We never are.	Aħna qatt ma aħna.
If you go, go.	Jekk tmur, tmur.
He is saying something.	Qed jgħid xi ħaġa.
It's a chance.	Hu ċans.
You can’t see the house, you say.	Inti ma tistax tara d-dar, inti tgħid.
No, she didn't know where she was going.	Le, ma kinitx taf fejn seta’ jkun.
It's coming.	Huwa ġej.
You know they were.	Int taf li kienu.
And it couldn’t have happened.	U ma setax ġara.
That was a bad idea.	Dik kienet idea ħażina.
Whatever it takes, do it.	Tkun xi tkun tieħu, tagħmel dan.
I understand that.	Nifhem dan.
It’s very, very difficult.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna, ħafna.
I never went there.	Qatt ma kont immur hemm.
I'm not that big.	Jien mhux daqshekk kbir.
That's all?	Dak kollox?
But, maybe, not for you.	Imma, forsi, mhux għalik.
But that is not what happened.	Imma dan mhux dak li ġara.
You should please do this more often for us.	Għandek jekk jogħġbok tagħmel dan aktar spiss għalina.
It was more that it was still time.	Kien aktar li kien għadu wasal iż-żmien.
It was just on such people.	Kien eżatt fuq nies bħal dawn.
He is a friend of his own.	Huwa ħabib ta’ min ikollu.
That’s what you want to do.	Huwa dak li trid tagħmel.
It was my job.	Kien ix-xogħol tiegħi.
He has someone else.	Huwa għandu xi ħadd ieħor.
He wanted nothing.	Ma ried xejn.
They were just sitting there.	Kienu biss bilqiegħda hemm.
Sometimes, it works.	Xi drabi, jaħdem.
You can’t do that tonight.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan illejla.
He wasn’t so sure.	Ma kienx daqshekk ċert.
He went back.      	Huwa mar lura.      
In fact we don't.	Fil-fatt aħna ma.
But you know it.	Imma taf dan.
I don't know.	Ma nafx dan.
It would make everything easier.	Ikun jagħmel kollox aktar faċli.
Or try.	Jew ipprova.
I want this.	Jien irrid din.
You can, you know.	Tista’, taf.
And so are you.	U hekk int.
I was never a child.	Qatt ma kont tifel.
She didn’t have to do that, either.	Hija ma kellha tagħmel dan, lanqas.
I wonder how they are doing this.	Nistaqsi kif qed jagħmlu dan.
Tell her first.	Għid hi l-ewwel.
I don’t like to talk about it.	Ma nħobbx nitkellem dwarha.
I don’t want that, either.	Ma rridx dan, lanqas.
That was a lot of money.	Dak kien ħafna flus.
And so he did.	U hekk għamel.
But of course, there is much more.	Imma ovvjament, hemm ħafna aktar.
Or it could be.	Jew jista 'jkun.
You don't want that.	Inti ma tridx li.
You were worried for me.	Inti kont inkwetat għalija.
I can't say more.	Ma nistax ngħid aktar.
He did a good job.	Huwa għamel xogħol tajjeb.
Now you can do whatever you want.	Issa tista 'tagħmel dak kollu li trid.
I don't need anything.	M'għandi bżonn xejn.
That’s what happens.	Huwa dak li jiġri.
I don’t know much about any of these.	Ma naf ħafna dwar xi wieħed minn dawn.
He is coming back.	Huwa ġej lura.
You will be amazed at how well it works.	Inti ser tkun sorpriż kemm dan jaħdem.
Never ever do that.	Qatt qatt tagħmel hekk.
That's not what.	Dak mhux dak.
Well, it was a lot.	Ukoll, kien ħafna.
The dog looks tired.	Il-kelb jidher għajjien.
Time went wrong.	Iż-żmien mar ħażin.
But I can say that.	Imma nista’ ngħid dan.
Nothing came.	Ma daħal xejn.
Well, she wasn't doing that.	Ukoll, hi ma kinitx tagħmel dan.
I think you are right.	Naħseb li għandek raġun.
We knew he wasn't going to be there.	Konna nafu li ma kienx se jkun hemm.
Now is the time.	Issa jasal iż-żmien.
I'm pretty sure it will.	Jien pjuttost ċert li se.
Who knows where.	Min jaf fejn.
I was very young.	Kont żgħir ħafna.
It doesn’t look like it was.	Ma jidhirx li kien.
Apparently they were just here.	Jidher li kienu biss hawn.
He did.	Dan għamel.
But that's it.	Imma dak hu.
I just wanted to talk to you.	Ridt biss nitkellem miegħek.
For years now.	Għal snin issa.
I hope you are too.	Nittama li int ukoll.
I want you to be here with me.	Irrid li tkun hawn miegħi.
You came and did something.	Int ġejt u għamilt xi ħaġa.
We will never be.	Qatt ma nkunu.
We have to do this every morning !.	Irridu nagħmlu dan kull filgħodu!.
No one had either.	Lanqas ħadd ma kellu.
I know he did.	Naf li hekk għamel.
This is what you should do.	Dan huwa dak li għandek tagħmel.
This is not what we need.	Dan mhux dak li għandna bżonn.
It wasn’t fast enough.	Ma kienx malajr biżżejjed.
Nobody knew that such a thing could happen.	Ħadd ma kien jaf li jista’ jkun hemm affarijiet bħal dawn.
You want to know everything.	Trid tkun taf kollox.
He knew he had to do something.	Kien jaf li kellu jagħmel xi ħaġa.
I'm just going to go with what he's saying and doing now.	Jien se mmur biss ma’ dak li qed jgħid u jagħmel issa.
You know, you're really beautiful.	Taf, int verament sabiħa.
She is so beautiful to me, like everyone else.	Hija tant sabiħa miegħi, bħal kulħadd.
I was very surprised.	Kont sorpriż ħafna.
I’ve never been able to do anything like that, of course.	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din, ovvjament.
I think it would be very difficult.	Naħseb li jkun diffiċli ħafna.
And now here she is.	U issa hawn hi.
And this happens here.	U dan jiġri hawn.
You have to take a chance.	Għandek tieħu ċans.
My good friend.	Ħabib tajjeb tiegħi.
This did not appear either.	Dan ma deher lanqas.
I just sat down and did nothing.	I biss poġġa bilqiegħda u ma għamilt xejn.
He knows what really happened.	Hu jaf x’kien ġara tassew.
I had never been here.	Qatt ma kelli ġejt hawn.
It’s work, it’s work.	Huwa xogħol, huwa xogħol.
You are doing well.	Int sejjer tajjeb.
Money.	Flus.
I need to.	Għandi bżonn.
I’m happy with that.	Jien kuntent b'dan.
Today, everyone does everything.	Illum, kulħadd jagħmel kollox.
My friends.	Ħbieb tiegħi.
You are right enough.	Għandek raġun biżżejjed.
Say nothing.	Tgħid xejn.
He didn't stand a chance.	Ma kellux ċans.
Something else she wants.	Xi ħaġa oħra hija trid.
I can’t take it anymore.	Ma nistax nieħu aktar.
It was just there.	Kien hemm biss.
Now I'm going.	Issa sejjer.
For many, it wasn’t a big deal.	Għal ħafna, ma kienx xi ħaġa kbira.
No, there is nothing.	Le, m'hemm xejn.
Another problem.	Problema oħra.
He plays like that.	Huwa jilgħab hekk.
It was some years ago.	Kien xi snin ilu.
There is always something you can do.	Dejjem hemm xi ħaġa li tista’ tagħmel.
Of everything.	Ta kollox.
Everything was.	Kollox kienet.
We will be back soon.	Se nkunu lura dalwaqt.
If not yours, everyone can say.	Jekk le tiegħek, kulħadd ikun jista 'jgħid.
They were so many things.	Kienu tant affarijiet.
If it came to that.	Jekk wasal għal dak.
You don’t see anyone.	Ma tara lil ħadd.
He wanted a boy.	Ried tifel.
Very good maybe.	Tajjeb ħafna forsi.
It was so wherever he went.	Kien hekk kull fejn mar.
He was a good friend.	Kien ħabib tajjeb.
It's pretty easy to do.	Huwa pjuttost faċli li tagħmel.
I have so much fun.	Jien nieħu gost ħafna hekk.
Not only that.	Mhux dan biss.
Not for me.	Mhux għalija.
He will wait.	Huwa se jistenna.
There is nothing you can do about it.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
And it’s nothing more than that.	U mhu xejn aktar minn hekk.
It wasn’t hard.	Ma kienx diffiċli.
I was trying.	Kont qed nipprova.
she says.	hi tgħid.
He lived there.	Kien jgħix hemmhekk.
He was not ready.	Ma kienx lest.
I know mine was.	Naf tiegħi kien.
Some things you only need to do once.	Xi affarijiet li għandek bżonn tagħmel darba biss.
He was never sure why.	Hu qatt ma kien ċert għaliex.
That was when it was.	Dak kien meta kien.
But it was good.	Imma kien tajjeb.
He did not know how far he had gone.	Ma kienx jaf kemm kien mar.
But he is not.	Imma hu mhux.
Now, look at these.	Issa, ħares lejn dawn.
No one is happy.	Ħadd mhu kuntent.
You can't do everything.	Ma tistax tagħmel kollox.
Or maybe you don’t want her to.	Jew forsi ma tridx li hi.
I'm still trying to figure out what it is.	Għadni qed nipprova nifhem dak li jista’ jkun.
I only have mine.	Għandi biss tiegħi.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
It works very well.	Jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
He knew nothing about anything else either.	Hu ma kien jaf xejn dwar xi ħaġa oħra lanqas.
I was really interested.	Kont verament interessat.
You go well.	Inti tmur ukoll.
But she will stand alone.	Imma hi se toqgħod waħedha.
I’m trying to do the same thing.	Qed nipprova nagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
Maybe it never will.	Forsi qatt ma se.
But he could see.	Imma seta’ jara.
It's been too long.	Ilu mar wisq.
It’s still the same.	Huwa għadu l-istess.
This here, and there and there.	Dan hawn, u hemm u hemm.
Who lives here?	Min jgħix hawn?
Waiting.	Ta’ min jistenna.
There were only a few.	Kien hemm biss ftit.
It wasn’t as bad as all that.	Ma kienx ħażin daqs dak kollu.
And so are you.	U hekk int.
I knew this was not what it was supposed to be.	Kont naf li dan ma kienx dak li kellu jkun.
This is easier than it sounds.	Dan huwa aktar faċli milli jidher.
It had to be work, school.	Kellu jkun ix-xogħol, l-iskola.
And we almost did.	U kważi għamilna.
If he had done so, so it would have been.	Li kieku għamel hekk, hekk kien.
I returned.	I lura.
I didn’t know that.	Jien ma kontx naf li.
It was the last to arrive.	Kien l-aħħar li wasal.
We cannot do that.	Aħna ma nistgħux nagħmlu dan.
And no one really wants that.	U ħadd ma jrid tassew hekk.
And you can do it.	U inti tista 'tagħmel dan.
Just really hard.	Biss verament diffiċli.
It was never too late.	Qatt ma kien tard.
It was just bad.	Kien ħażin biss.
I know you do.	Naf li tagħmel.
You don't know.	Inti ma tkunx taf.
I wanted to do it again.	Ridt nerġa’ nagħmel.
There was no one there.	Ma kien hemm ħadd hemmhekk.
He looked around.	Huwa ħares madwar.
i'm going to try that.	jien ser nipprova dak.
Everything alone.	Kollox waħdu.
I like a lot of things.	Inħobb ħafna affarijiet.
He can do anything.	Jista 'jagħmel kollox.
It’s just me having fun.	Huwa biss lili nieħu gost.
You can do that too.	Tista 'tagħmel dan ukoll.
I take this.	Jien nieħu dan.
I know I didn’t want that.	Naf li ma ridtx dan.
You want to know.	Trid tkun taf.
We need a few things.	Għandna bżonn ftit affarijiet.
Or something like that.	Jew xi ħaġa bħal dik.
But it won't be.	Imma mhux se jkun.
It wasn't his thing.	Ma kinitx ħaġa tiegħu.
It didn’t seem so long ago.	Ma jidhirx daqshekk twil ilu.
I shouldn’t have said such things.	Ma kellix ngħid affarijiet bħal dawn.
Let me think more about this.	Ħa naħseb aktar dwar dan.
Not the same today.	Mhux l-istess illum.
But not only that.	Imma mhux hekk biss.
It seemed a little too easy.	Deher ftit wisq faċli.
But more on that a little later.	Imma aktar dwar dan ftit aktar tard.
But there was more to it than that.	Imma kien hemm aktar minn hekk.
Look at what he did.	Ħares lejn dak li għamel.
But it's not beautiful.	Imma mhix sabiħa.
You are not going there.	M'intix sejjer hemm.
I wish you didn’t.	Nixtieq li ma tagħmilx hekk.
Maybe a little.	Forsi ftit.
I couldn’t sit down.	Ma stajtx noqgħod bilqiegħda.
There must be a better way.	Għandu jkun hemm mod aħjar.
Much more actually.	Ħafna aktar fil-fatt.
I have a better idea.	Għandi idea aħjar.
I can't wait for you.	Ma nistax nistenna miegħek.
But no more than one.	Imma mhux aktar minn wieħed.
Just the same.	Biss l-istess.
It could be a lot more.	Jista 'jkun ħafna aktar.
You don't seem happy to see me.	Inti ma jidhirx kuntent li tara lili.
It doesn't seem that.	Ma jidhirx li.
And he knew where he lived, too.	U kien jaf fejn jgħix, ukoll.
This is just before you do it.	Dan huwa eżatt qabel ma tagħmel dan.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
No, not only that.	Le, mhux dik biss.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
He looks tired, he seems.	Jidher għajjien, jidher .
I really wish it couldn’t be.	Nixtieq ħafna li ma jistax ikun.
I'm at school.	Jien l-iskola.
He is often right.	Ħafna drabi għandu raġun.
Soon, it will be.	Dalwaqt, ikun.
He had not arrived home last night.	Hu ma kienx wasal id-dar ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
He should be worried.	Għandu jkun inkwetat.
You don't even know who you are.	Lanqas taf min int.
That was what it was.	Dan kien dak li kien.
I'm not so ready.	Jien hekk mhux lest.
The job is done.	Ix-xogħol sar.
It's just there.	Huwa biss hemm.
I was pretty glad.	Kont pjuttost ferħan.
We will never know.	Qatt ma nkunu nafu dan.
I don’t think he had much.	Ma naħsibx li kellu ħafna.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.	Xejn bħal dan qatt ma ġara qabel.
But this is it.	Imma dan hu.
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.	Ma nafx x'qed nagħmel ħażin.
Everyone was scared.	Kulħadd kien jibża.
You will not live without it.	Inti mhux se jgħix mingħajr dan.
This has been happening today.	Dan ilu jiġri llum.
I think it’s great.	Naħseb li huwa kbir.
Chance.	Ċans.
You must have been here hours ago.	Għandek tkun hawn sigħat ilu.
Each time, there was a problem.	Kull darba, kien hemm problema.
Not for years if ever.	Mhux għal snin jekk qatt.
You are coming with us.	Int ġej magħna.
I’m telling you the truth.	Jien ngħidlek il-verità.
I'm waiting.	Nistenna.
It is not.	Mhuwiex.
I have to go now.	Ikolli mmur issa.
It should be enough.	Għandu jkun biżżejjed.
Maybe more.	Forsi aktar.
It shouldn’t be here, it shouldn’t even be here.	M'għandux ikun hawn, lanqas biss għandu jkun hawn.
He had never done this before.	Hu qatt ma kellu jagħmel dan qabel.
No one is driving.	Ħadd ma qed isuq.
Are you sure you want to view this?	Int żgur li trid tara dan?
I don’t like it here, you know.	Ma nħobbx hawn, taf.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
I know why you came here.	Naf għaliex ġejt hawn.
Obviously, he didn’t know what to do.	Ovvjament, ma kienx jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
Whatever you want is what you will do.	Tkun xi tkun tixtieq huwa dak li inti se tagħmel.
It's small here.	Huwa żgħir hawn.
But it was hard to.	Imma kien diffiċli li.
I definitely spent a lot of time on this.	Żgur li għamilt ħafna ħin fuq dan.
But me.	Imma jien.
We know little about it.	Nafu ftit dwarha.
It was much, much more.	Kien ħafna, ħafna aktar.
I know people who need it.	Naf nies li għandhom bżonn dan.
It was almost ready.	Kien kważi lest.
I don't have a car.	M'għandix karozza.
They were years.	Kienu snin.
Lots of fun.	Ħafna gost.
It looks more like hours.	Jidher aktar qisu sigħat.
That was not good.	Dak ma kienx tajjeb.
There was nothing to see.	Ma kien hemm xejn x'tara.
You can't be both.	Inti ma tistax tkun it-tnejn.
You can say anything.	Tista’ tgħid xi ħaġa.
Maybe she knew what was coming.	Forsi kienet taf x’kien ġej.
It started a lot.	Beda ħafna.
I have no idea what they will do next.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'se jagħmlu wara.
I hope it helps !.	Nittama li jgħin!.
It was a lot.	Kien ħafna.
he said.	hu qal.
It looked like.	Deher qisu.
We know more about this now.	Nafu aktar dwar dan issa.
She is ready for.	Hija lest għal.
It would not be difficult.	Ma jkunx diffiċli.
I was wrong.	Kont ħażin ħażin.
It’s not enough really.	Mhuwiex biżżejjed verament.
Everyone said so.	Kulħadd qal hekk.
You can't talk.	Ma tistax titkellem.
It works very well.	Jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
I wanted to be someone.	Ridt inkun xi ħadd.
Is there anyone else out there still waiting?!?.	Hemm xi ħadd ieħor hemm barra għadu jistenna?!?.
Ask if he can stand it.	Staqsa jekk jistax joqgħod.
This here is for people only.	Dan hawn huwa għal nies biss.
I don't know who it might be.	Ma nafx min jista’ jkun.
You alone.	Int biss.
He wasn’t having any of that.	Ma kien qed ikollu xejn minn dan.
I am waiting outside your house.	Qed nistenna barra d-dar tiegħek.
He needs work.	Huwa għandu bżonn ix-xogħol.
I thought it might be difficult, but it wasn't.	Kont ħsibt li jista’ jkun diffiċli, imma ma kienx.
It must be done.	Irid isir.
There are many things we can do.	Hemm ħafna affarijiet li nistgħu nagħmlu.
He had no idea how he did it.	Ma kellux idea kif għamel dan.
No one else was around.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien madwar.
He has to go now.	Huwa għandu jmur issa.
Time to plan.	Ħin biex tippjana.
No one ever really knows the truth.	Ħadd qatt ma jaf tassew il-verità.
I never knew.	Qatt ma kont naf.
But I never saw anyone there.	Imma qatt ma rajt lil ħadd hemmhekk.
With each other.	Ma 'xulxin.
She wants to be there.	Hija trid tkun hemm.
I just wasn’t.	Jien biss ma kontx.
Not much.	Mhux ħafna.
He seemed happy.	Huwa deher kuntent.
That’s what you’re seeing.	Dak hu li qed tara.
It's hard to take.	Huwa diffiċli li tieħu.
I saw the truth.	Rajt il-verità.
And he doesn’t talk much.	U ma tantx titkellem.
I’m not sure if it’s bad of me or not.	M'inix ċert jekk hux ħażin minni jew le.
I’m glad you came.	Jien ferħan li ġejt.
If I were here.	Kieku kont hawn.
She was supposed to be back today.	Hija suppost kellha tiġi lura llum.
There was nothing.	Ma kien hemm xejn.
No one else can do that.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jagħmel dan.
He felt scared.	Ħassu jibża.
I wasn’t completely surprised.	Ma kontx sorpriż għal kollox.
And what I was doing.	U dak li kont qed tagħmel.
And he won't.	U hu mhux se.
It was not so.	Ma kienx hekk.
Maybe I was at work.	Forsi kont fuq ix-xogħol.
He was doing this over and over.	Huwa kien qed jagħmel dan aktar u aktar.
It happens a lot.	Jiġri ħafna.
I know this is wrong.	Naf li dan huwa ħażin.
If we want.	Jekk irridu.
Nothing was being done.	Xejn kien qed isir.
It has just come out.	Għadu kemm ħareġ.
This is a very difficult problem.	Din hija problema diffiċli ħafna.
I don’t know how I did that.	Ma nafx kif għamilt dan.
Please, please, please.	Jekk jogħġbok, jekk jogħġbok, jekk jogħġbok.
But this was not so bad.	Imma dan ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
Well, here we are again.	Ukoll, hawn aħna mill-ġdid.
Everything he was going to say will wait.	Dak kollu li kien se jgħid se jistenna.
Worried for him.	Inkwetat għalih.
I’m not surprised to say no.	M'iniex sorpriż li tgħid le.
I was out and about.	I kien barra u madwar.
Something happened.	Ġara xi ħaġa.
But it didn’t have to be.	Imma ma kellux ikun.
He seems to want to say more.	Jidher li jrid jgħid aktar.
One must always tell the truth.	Wieħed għandu dejjem jgħid il-verità.
But it had to be there.	Imma kellha tkun hemm.
But so is he.	Imma hekk hu.
Come here, come here.	Ejja hawn, ejja hawn.
I do that.	Jien nagħmel dan.
No one knew anything.	Ħadd ma kien jaf xi ħaġa.
Well, no you shouldn’t.	Ukoll, le m'għandekx.
Everyone will go back.	Kulħadd se jmur lura.
Everything is as it should be.	Kollox huwa kif għandu jkun.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kinitx.
He was home and always would be.	Kien id-dar u dejjem kien ikun.
Well, that's what you say.	Ukoll, dak li tgħid li int.
But she didn't know it.	Imma hi ma kinitx taf dan.
Person.	Persuna.
I would be ready.	Inkun lest.
Neither am I, but neither is a man.	Jien lanqas, imma lanqas raġel.
Who says so?	Min jgħid hekk?
Probably still.	Probabbilment għadu.
I'm like everyone else.	Jien bħal kulħadd.
You are mine, forever mine.	Inti tiegħi, għal dejjem tiegħi.
I just know he’s not.	Naf biss li hu mhux.
You don't even know how it happened.	Lanqas taf kif ġara.
It had to be worthless.	Kellha tkun ta’ xejn.
Why would you ?.	Għaliex kieku inti?.
She needed some help.	Hija kellha bżonn xi għajnuna.
How to make your own.	Kif tagħmel tiegħek.
This is very time consuming.	Dan huwa ħafna ħin.
Without a job.	Mingħajr xogħol.
He entered the room.	Huwa daħal fil-kamra.
I should know that by this time without question.	Għandi naf li sa dan iż-żmien mingħajr ma nistaqsi.
They felt something was wrong.	Ħassu xi ħaġa ħażina.
And there seems to be only one way to do that.	U jidher li hemm mod wieħed biss biex tagħmel dan.
If she only knew.	Kieku kienet taf.
I thought it was really good.	Ħsibt li kien tassew tajjeb.
He was there, doing nothing.	Huwa kien hemm, ma jagħmel xejn.
As it were.	Kif kien.
But fast enough.	Imma malajr biżżejjed.
But no one else.	Imma ħadd ieħor.
That was as far as she could go.	Dan kien sa fejn kienet tmur hi.
We do so here.	Aħna nagħmlu hekk hawn.
We just didn't know anything else.	Aħna biss ma konna nafu xi ħaġa oħra.
We do something for you.	Aħna nagħmlu xi ħaġa għalik.
But, but, but.	Imma, imma, imma.
You are not ready yet.	Għadek m'intix lest.
I had nothing.	Jien ma kelli xejn.
There are more than ever.	Hemm aktar minn qatt qabel.
We are just here and nothing has happened.	Aħna biss aħna hawn u ma ġara xejn.
He, he knew who he was.	Hu, kien jaf min kien.
I hope you are well.	Nispera li inti tajjeb.
Obviously now, its.	Ovvjament issa, tiegħu.
I was one.	Jien kont wieħed.
It will be much, much better.	Se jkun ħafna, ħafna aħjar.
Maybe it really is.	Forsi huwa tassew.
But now he couldn’t.	Imma issa ma setax.
He said it many times.	Huwa qal ħafna drabi.
I had mine.	Kelli tiegħi.
Just this one thing.	Biss din ħaġa waħda.
They really do that.	Huma verament jagħmlu dan.
Obviously she was even more beautiful than before.	Ovvjament kienet għadha aktar sabiħa minn qabel.
It is better to be so.	Huwa aħjar li tkun hekk.
It seemed like a long time.	Deher qisu żmien twil.
Maybe it was a while ago.	Forsi kien ftit ilu.
There was something before that.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa qabel dik.
I'm glad you're okay.	Jien kuntent li int tajjeb.
I like to be outside.	Inħobb inkun barra.
I wasn’t really thinking of anything else.	Jien ma kontx verament naħseb xi ħaġa oħra.
Neither do you.	U lanqas int.
That’s all back to me now.	Dak kollu huwa lura lili issa.
I never had.	Qatt ma kelli.
That is for sure.	Dan huwa żgur.
They were all wrong.	Kienu dak kollu li kien ħażin.
It will happen.	Huwa se jiġri.
I wanted to do something difficult.	Ridt nagħmel xi ħaġa diffiċli.
You can't do that.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan.
This can’t be so great.	Dan ma jistax ikun daqshekk kbir.
So it was with us.	Hekk kien magħna.
You'll like that, too.	Inti ser bħal dik, ukoll.
He should know.	Huwa għandu jkun jaf.
And everything works properly.	U kollox jaħdem kif suppost.
Not bad and not great.	Mhux ħażin u mhux kbir.
I had that.	Kellek dak.
I want to know everything.	Irrid inkun naf kollox.
How.	Kif .
Sorry, boy.	Jiddispjaċini, tifel.
If only for a while.	Jekk biss għal ftit żmien.
She did so.	Hija għamlet hekk.
And another, on.	U ieħor, fuq.
He didn’t know about it.	Ma kienx jaf dwar dan.
It looks good.	Jidher tajjeb.
But she never knew why, either.	Imma hi qatt ma kienet taf għaliex, lanqas.
There’s something you don’t want to see.	Hemm xi ħaġa li ma tridx tara.
Me too.	Jien ukoll.
That's all, 'he said.	Hekk biss,’ qal.
Who knows, it might work.	Min jaf, jista 'jaħdem.
This works well for some people.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb għal xi nies.
And it actually came pretty easy.	U fil-fatt wasal pjuttost faċli.
I really have.	Jien verament għandi.
It’s a big job.	Huwa xogħol kbir.
I was so scared and I didn't know what to do.	Kont tant jibża’ u ma kontx naf x’se nagħmel.
It looked good too.	Deher tajjeb wisq.
That was a good one.	Dik kienet waħda tajba.
It was his home.	Kienet id-dar tiegħu.
It seems to want to be the problem.	Jidher li trid tkun il-problema.
I was not afraid.	Ma kontx nibża’.
There you have it.	Hemmhekk għandek.
He will live with me.	Hu ser jgħix miegħi.
You are my friend.	Int ħabib tiegħi.
It was no problem.	Ma kienet l-ebda problema.
No one should do that.	Ħadd ma għandu jagħmel dan.
Not all is well.	Mhux kollox tajjeb.
She was very beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa ħafna.
Everyone knew, but not me.	Kulħadd kien jaf, imma mhux jien.
It was just mine.	Kien biss tiegħi.
But enough of that.	Imma biżżejjed minn hekk.
I can’t do everything today or even this week.	Ma nistax nagħmel kollox illum u lanqas din il-ġimgħa.
You have no chance of that.	Inti għandek l-ebda ċans ta 'dak.
She is doing it on her own.	Hija qed tagħmel dan waħedha.
He didn't know why.	Ma kienx jaf għaliex.
Okay, let's go.	Tajjeb, ejja mmorru.
And never.	U qatt ma.
You just need me and me.	Għandek bżonn lili u lili biss.
He’s a big boy now.	Huwa tifel kbir issa.
I couldn’t believe he was gone.	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien mar.
I still can’t say much about it here.	Għadni ma nistax ngħid ħafna dwarha hawn.
This is not how it works.	Dan mhux kif jaħdem.
Look back at the door.	Ħares lura lejn il-bieb.
You go, you.	Inti tmur, int.
I'm afraid to talk to him again.	Nibża’ nitkellem lura miegħu.
If anything, more will happen.	Jekk xejn, jiġri aktar.
His and yours.	Tiegħu u tiegħek.
This is good.	Dan huwa tajjeb.
But there is more, of course.	Imma hemm aktar, ovvjament.
This is where the problem lies.	Dan huwa fejn il-problema.
Not sure how this works.	Mhux ċert kif dan jaħdem.
The last thing.	L-aħħar ħaġa.
What it looks like.	Dak li jidher li.
I wonder what’s easier.	Nistaqsi x'inhu aktar faċli.
He must have been right.	Irid kellu raġun.
It’s the first thing to do.	Hija l-ewwel ħaġa li tagħmel.
I didn’t know why or how.	Ma kontx naf għaliex jew kif.
Not so much.	Mhux daqshekk.
That wasn’t an easy thing to do.	Dik ma kinitx ħaġa faċli li tagħmel.
I couldn’t take it anymore.	Ma stajtx nieħu aktar.
Now we are friends.	Issa aħna ħbieb.
I don’t want to think about anything.	Ma rrid naħseb dwar xejn.
That's what they need.	Dak hu li għandhom bżonn.
Everyone started talking.	Kulħadd beda jitkellem.
I haven’t even come home yet.	Għadni lanqas biss ġejt id-dar.
But he would not come.	Imma ma kienx jiġi.
I’m not sure they were ever there.	M'inix ċert li qatt kienu hemm.
All that was wrong, that was me.	Dak kollu li kien ħażin, dak kont jien.
But that would be too easy.	Imma dan ikun faċli wisq.
It doesn't seem to be working.	Ma jidhirx li qed jaħdem.
I think you want to know.	Naħseb li trid tkun taf.
It was his time.	Kien iż-żmien tiegħu.
He can’t have both.	Ma jistax ikollu t-tnejn.
I don’t need that now.	M'għandix bżonn dak issa.
He was always good to me.	Dejjem kien tajjeb miegħi.
She had one too.	Kellha waħda wisq.
If you can only think.	Jekk inti tista 'biss taħseb.
I don’t have time for such things.	M'għandix ħin għal affarijiet bħal dawn.
I can’t do that now.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan issa.
I didn’t want anything.	Jien ma ridt xejn.
He couldn't be sure.	Ma setax ikun ċert.
As long as we want to be.	Sakemm irridu nkunu.
That was by day.	Dak kien bi nhar.
You're too young.	Int żgħir wisq.
It was all for him.	Kienet kollox għalih.
It was perhaps the last time.	Hija forsi l-aħħar darba.
If you want.	Jekk trid.
Everything and everyone.	Kollox u kulħadd.
"of".	"ta'".
And so they were.	U hekk kienu.
And it is working.	U qed jaħdem.
This is something we have to do.	Din hija xi ħaġa li għandna nagħmlu.
It's too easy.	Huwa faċli wisq.
I really wasn’t much.	Verament ma kontx ħafna.
Well a man can be.	Ukoll raġel jista 'jkun.
But you're mine now.	Imma int tiegħi issa.
Maybe very little will.	Forsi ftit li xejn se.
I just had to be sure.	Kelli biss inkun ċert.
As expected.	Kif kien jistenna.
I still did.	Għadni għamilt.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Jiddispjaċini li nisma' dan.
By then it would be too late.	Sa dak iż-żmien ikun tard wisq.
He goes back to doing nothing.	Imur lura biex ma nagħmel xejn.
Lots of work for nothing.	Ħafna xogħol għal xejn.
This is how you properly do it.	Dan hu kif suppost tagħmel dan.
And about everyone.	U madwar kulħadd.
Or maybe you are.	Jew forsi inti.
It was the first time he had done so.	Kienet l-ewwel darba li għamel hekk.
But you have very little time to do much.	Imma ftit li xejn għandek ħin biex tagħmel ħafna.
It's never too late.	Qatt m'hu tard wisq.
But he did.	Imma hekk għamel.
Any help? 	Xi għajnuna?
This will take forever.	Dan se jieħu għal dejjem.
My friend bought this for me.	Ħabib tiegħi xtara dan għalija.
He did nothing more.	Ma għamel xejn aktar.
He did the same.	Huwa għamel l-istess.
It looked great.	Deher kbir.
It's so easy.	Huwa daqshekk faċli.
I am good at this.	Jiena tajjeb b'dan.
I doubt much of that.	Niddubita ħafna minn hekk.
Everything was the same.	Kollox kien l-istess.
There is no time.	M'hemm l-ebda ħin.
That was all I was.	Dak kollu kont jien.
There was something about it.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa dwarha.
Last time for you.	L-aħħar darba għalik.
It was too late now.	Issa kien tard wisq.
You can never tell.	Qatt ma tista’ tgħid.
The same people.	L-istess nies.
He knew he would not survive.	Kien jaf li mhux se jgħix.
If he has enough time it will be great.	Jekk ikollu ħin biżżejjed ikun kbir.
He has no job.	M’għandux xogħol.
That was really good.	Dan kien tassew tajjeb.
You have enough time.	Għandek ħin biżżejjed.
Only, there it was.	Biss, hemm kien.
Both of them.	It-tnejn li huma.
Well, obviously not.	Ukoll, ovvjament le.
They surprised each other.	Huma sorpriż lil xulxin.
Maybe years ago.	Forsi snin ilu.
I could be wrong about that.	Nista’ nkun ħażin ħażin dwar dan.
He passed out.	Huwa għadda barra.
Something else, too.	Xi ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
That last bit, above all.	Dik l-aħħar ftit, fuq kollox.
It was better.	Kien aħjar.
Come here first.	Ejja hawn l-ewwel.
Now that he thought about it.	Issa li ħaseb dwarha.
I will never believe that.	Jien qatt mhu ser nemmen li.
It had really happened.	Kien tassew ġara.
I was a little surprised.	Kont xi ftit sorpriż.
I need time to think about it.	Għandi bżonn iż-żmien biex naħseb dwarha.
It didn't look like it was.	Ma deherx li kien.
I just wanted to see something, something, happen.	Ridt biss nara xi ħaġa, xi ħaġa, jiġri.
Well, almost never.	Ukoll, kważi qatt.
You are not the only one.	M'intix l-uniku wieħed.
He had no idea what he was going to say.	Ma kellux idea x’se jgħid.
It's good.	Hija tajba.
These are all problems right now.	Dawn huma kollha problemi bħalissa.
And what they do with everything else.	U dak li jagħmlu kull ħaġa oħra.
I didn’t want to.	Ma ridtx.
It has you.	Għandu int.
You don’t have to.	M'għandekx għalfejn.
I don't want to.	Ma rridx.
But for everyone.	Imma għal kulħadd.
Very often.	Ħafna ħafna drabi.
He knew he didn't.	Kien jaf li m’għandux.
I couldn't see where I was doing this.	Ma stajtx nara fejn kont għamilt dan.
She has never done this before.	Hija qatt ma għamlet dan qabel.
We did both.	Għamilna t-tnejn.
He said he had.	Qal li kellu.
It should work properly now.	Għandu jaħdem kif suppost issa.
How could this have happened? 	Kif seta’ ġara?
For a while, nothing happened.	Għal xi żmien, ma ġara xejn.
I can never get over it.	Jien qatt ma nista’ nerġa’ lura minn dan.
I believe that.	Nemmen li.
Anyone can do that.	Kulħadd jista 'jagħmel dan.
Or once he did.	Jew darba għamel.
And she was alone.	U kienet waħedha.
He never did and never will.	Qatt ma għamel u qatt ma se.
I just couldn’t hear it that way.	Ma stajtx biss smajt hekk.
He needed to know.	Huwa kellu bżonn ikun jaf.
I have never seen so much.	Qatt ma rajt daqshekk.
But no one could.	Imma ħadd ma seta’.
Who was he.	Min kien hu.
Another.	Ieħor.
I didn’t know where we were.	Ma kontx naf fejn konna.
It works really well.	Jaħdem tassew tajjeb.
I need to know better.	Għandi nkun naf aħjar.
I was as happy as I could be.	Kont kuntent kif jista’ jkun.
You don’t even want to.	Lanqas trid.
You don’t have time to think.	M'għandekx ħin biex taħseb.
But together, we have a chance.	Imma flimkien, għandna ċans.
Obviously it doesn’t.	Ovvjament ma tagħmilx.
It’s something to do or not do.	Hija xi ħaġa li tagħmel jew ma tagħmilx.
But something happened.	Imma ġara xi ħaġa.
He had to know.	Kellu jkun jaf.
I wanted to be with you, to see why.	Ridt inkun miegħek, biex nara għaliex.
Come with me tonight.	Ejja miegħi illejla.
It says why.	Jgħid għaliex.
We have to go back.	Irridu mmorru lura.
But he’s not that, either.	Imma hu mhux dak, lanqas.
Just another time.	Darba oħra biss.
That was not there.	Li ma kienx hemm.
It is making everyone scared.	Qed tagħmel lil kulħadd jibża.
He was talking about her doing it.	Kien jitkellem dwarha li għamel dan.
I'm sure you do.	Jiena ċert li tagħmel.
And everyone, actually.	U kulħadd, fil-fatt.
I’m nothing without the house.	Jien xejn mingħajr id-dar.
It wasn’t easy, but it did.	Ma kienx faċli, imma hekk għamel.
I just wanted to be me.	Jien biss ridt inkun jien.
Do nothing.	Ma tagħmel xejn.
It's so bad.	Huwa daqshekk ħażin.
That's what I wanted, isn't it?	Dan hu dak li ridt, hux?
I'm scared.	Qed nibża.
I think we need that.	Naħseb li għandna bżonn dak.
I will go back there tomorrow morning.	Jien se mmur lura hemm għada filgħodu.
This is definitely not looking good.	Dan żgur mhux qed jidher tajjeb.
Well, there is.	Ukoll, hemm.
It should be.	Għandu jkun.
It was also my home.	Kien ukoll id-dar tiegħi.
And we know it works.	U nafu li jaħdem.
No one seems to want to do that.	Ħadd ma jidher li jrid jagħmel dan.
I want to understand what happened to me and why.	Irrid nifhem x'ġara lili u għaliex.
She was saying no.	Kienet tgħid le.
But I’m not even doing everything.	Imma jien lanqas qed nagħmel kollox.
I’m not sure why this is yet.	M'inix ċert għaliex dan għadu.
There is nothing you can do about it.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
said the first.	qal l-ewwel.
They are right, of course.	Huma għandhom raġun, ovvjament.
I just wasn't sure.	Jien biss ma kontx ċert.
I don’t know why this happened.	Ma nafx għaliex ġara dan.
Just one more thing.	Ħaġa waħda oħra biss.
He can play anything.	Jista’ jilgħab ikun xi jkun.
I'll tell you tomorrow.	Jien ngħidlek għada.
That's not bad.	Dak mhux ħażin.
Where ever you are.	Fejn qatt int.
He has no idea what to do.	M’għandux idea x’għandu jagħmel.
That was so great.	Dak kien daqshekk kbir.
It will never be enough.	Qatt mhu se jkun biżżejjed.
He was just trying to be helpful.	Kien biss qed jipprova jkun ta’ għajnuna.
When, of course, he knew nothing.	Meta, ovvjament, ma kien jaf xejn.
And so are you.	U hekk int.
But it's not working.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem.
In fact, nothing.	Fil-fatt, xejn.
But you're small.	Imma int żgħir.
No one can.	Ħadd ma jista’.
So does she.	Hekk tagħmel hi.
You have no one above this with you.	Inti ma għandek ħadd hawn fuq dan miegħek.
Only, it wasn’t.	Biss, ma kienx.
He wants to come home.	Irid li tiġi d-dar.
But not for long.	Imma mhux għal żmien twil.
Not sure what this is.	Mhux ċert x'inhu dan.
I'll tell you how.	Ngħidlek kif.
She is a person.	Hija persuna.
He left.	Huwa telaq.
As it were.	Kif kien.
I think you know that.	Naħseb li tkun taf li.
This is how it should be.	Dan huwa kif għandu jkun.
You did everything.	Int għamilt kollox.
This cannot go on forever.	Dan ma jistax imur għal dejjem.
I’m so ready for you.	Jien tant lest għalik.
I have no money.	M'għandix flus.
It's the only way.	Huwa l-uniku mod.
I know he knows.	Naf li jaf.
I said.	Jien għidt.
He knows we don't have that.	Jaf li m’għandniex hekk.
It just wasn’t.	Biss ma kienx.
I didn’t expect you to know this.	Ma kontx nistenna li tkun taf dan.
And it was a great thing.	U kienet ħaġa kbira.
He does what he wants to do.	Jagħmel dak li jrid jagħmel.
But you were right.	Imma kellek raġun.
He won't, he can't.	Hu mhux se, hu ma jistax.
But there will be enough time for that someday.	Imma jkun hemm żmien biżżejjed għal dak xi darba.
You have an account there.	Għandek kont hemm.
I don’t know much about it.	Ma nafx wisq dwarha.
I want one.	Nixtieq wieħed.
This has never happened before.	Dan qatt ma ġara qabel.
But you were there.	Imma int kont hemm.
You are going as you can.	Int sejjer kif tista'.
Everything better in the morning.	Kollox aħjar filgħodu.
He had no idea where he was.	Ma kellux idea fejn kien.
One thing is, or not.	Ħaġa hija, jew mhix.
Afternoon or evening.	Wara nofsinhar jew filgħaxija.
I wanted to be better than that.	Ridt inkun aħjar minn hekk.
Do you see that dog there?	Tara dak il-kelb hemmhekk?
I can’t believe there are people who do something like this.	Ma nistax nemmen li hemm nies li jagħmlu xi ħaġa bħal din.
It can be quite overwhelming.	Jista 'jkun pjuttost kbira.
I want some time alone with you.	Irrid ftit ħin waħdi miegħek.
From any person.	Minn kull persuna.
He had to do what he had to do.	Kellu jagħmel dak li kellu jagħmel.
He knew something was wrong with me.	Kien jaf li xi ħaġa ma kinitx tajba miegħi.
Well maybe we do and maybe not.	Ukoll forsi nagħmlu u forsi le.
But you don’t have to stay if you don’t want to.	Imma m'għandekx għalfejn toqgħod jekk ma tridx.
You know.	Int tkun taf.
As it was next week.	Kif kien il-ġimgħa d-dieħla.
It's a thing.	Hija ħaġa.
We had a few problems.	Kellna ftit problemi.
Maybe she really did.	Forsi hi tassew għamlet.
About that time, it became too much for me.	Dwar dak iż-żmien, sar wisq għalija.
He wanted to know more.	Ried ikun jaf aktar.
But not so with you.	Imma mhux hekk miegħek.
This is what it should be.	Dan huwa dak li għandu jkun.
Not looking good.	Mhux qed jidher tajjeb.
I'm always with you.	Jien dejjem miegħek.
I don't want him to know about it.	Ma rridx li jkun jaf b’dan.
That’s hard to say.	Dik huwa diffiċli li tgħid.
I knew it was a bad one.	Kont naf li kien wieħed ħażin.
He never knew.	Hu qatt ma kien jaf.
It's really pretty good.	Huwa verament pjuttost tajjeb.
It was beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa.
Three hours ago.	Tliet sigħat ilu.
Probably something not so good.	Probabbilment xi ħaġa mhux daqshekk tajba.
It’s great, actually.	Hija kbira, fil-fatt.
There is work.	Hemm xogħol.
My husband.	Raġel tiegħi.
I’ve been home all week.	Jien kont id-dar il-ġimgħa kollha.
But she does.	Imma hi tagħmel.
I have never seen this before.	Qatt ma rajt dan qabel.
Everything was fine.	Kollox kien tajjeb.
There was nothing he could do.	Ma kien hemm xejn li seta’ jagħmel.
But he knew he had to do something.	Imma kien jaf li kellu jagħmel xi ħaġa.
How does this work?	Kif jaħdem dan?
It's for him.	Huwa għalih.
Idea! 	Idea!
he said.	hu qal.
Or it can have no more than.	Jew jista 'jkollu mhux aktar minn.
You knew it was coming.	Kont taf li kien ġej.
I just didn't think this would work.	I biss ma ħsibt li dan se jaħdem.
It seemed hours.	Deher sigħat.
I never had anything of my own.	Qatt ma kelli xi ħaġa tiegħi.
All on your own.	Kollha waħdek.
I have often said the same thing.	Ħafna drabi għidt l-istess jien.
It's after one.	Huwa wara wieħed.
He took it for himself very quickly.	Huwa ħa għalih malajr ħafna.
That’s it, as long as you’re just here for that.	Huwa dak, sakemm int biss hawn għal dak.
There are no children.	M'hemm l-ebda tifel.
I can do it alone.	Jien nista' nagħmel waħdi.
Everyone needs to do this.	Kulħadd jeħtieġ li jagħmel dan.
He will do nothing.	Mhu se jagħmel xejn.
But there you are.	Imma hemm int.
We knew it was our last time together.	Konna nafu li kienet l-aħħar darba tagħna flimkien.
You are doing a great job here.	Qed tagħmel xogħol kbir hawn.
They have a lot.	Għandhom ħafna.
No, really we are not.	Le, tassew aħna le.
But this is not so.	Imma dan mhux hekk.
This can be.	Dan jista 'jkun.
But that was not enough.	Imma dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
And it will do that.	U se jagħmel dan.
I am three years old.	Għandi tliet snin.
Something definitely better than nothing.	Xi ħaġa żgur aħjar minn xejn.
Something about it was all wrong.	Xi ħaġa dwarha kienet kollha ħażina.
I know he knows.	Naf li jaf.
And you know why.	U taf għaliex.
No one is buying anything.	Ħadd mhu qed jixtri xejn.
But that was the week before.	Imma dik kienet il-ġimgħa ta’ qabel.
It's happening now.	Qed jiġri issa.
We want to be.	Irridu nkunu.
He is after something to eat.	Huwa wara xi ħaġa li jiekol.
He said he was.	Qal li kien.
I needed some help.	Kelli bżonn xi għajnuna.
There is no way to know.	M'hemm l-ebda mod kif tkun taf.
The book was not there before.	Il-ktieb ma kienx hemm qabel.
They are better than that.	Huma aħjar minn hekk.
But of course.	Imma ovvjament.
It was like, well, this is working for me.	Kienet bħal, ukoll, dan qed jaħdem għalija.
He says he is.	Jgħid li hu.
This is difficult.	Dan huwa diffiċli.
I'm going very fast.	Jien sejjer malajr ħafna'.
This speaks for itself.	Dan jitkellem waħdu.
He has to come home last night.	Għandu jiġi d-dar l-aħħar filgħaxija.
Not very likely.	Mhux probabbli ħafna.
And, of course, it was very small.	U, ovvjament, kien żgħir ħafna.
This was my friend.	Dan kien ħabib tiegħi.
The exact same.	L-istess eżatt.
Here they are.	Hawn huma.
More than enough.	Aktar minn biżżejjed.
Three years later.	Tliet snin wara.
Let me tell you a little bit about both.	Ħa ngħidlek ftit dwar it-tnejn.
I say too long.	Ngħid twil wisq.
She is so beautiful.	Hija tant sabiħa.
I have no idea how I will do that.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif se nagħmel dan.
No, you don't.	Le, m'għandekx.
You had me.	Kellek lili.
I was going to stay there.	Kont immur noqgħod noqgħod hemm.
I did exactly what I said.	Għamilt eżatt dak li għedt.
He should eat something.	Għandu jiekol xi ħaġa.
I couldn’t do what they do.	Ma stajtx nagħmel dak li jagħmlu huma.
Unless anyone is volunteering to come up with a pretty template?	Sakemm ma jidhirx xi ħadd aktar tard.
This is not happening today.	Dan mhux qed jiġri llum.
I think you are.	Naħseb li int.
He had thought that.	Huwa kien ħaseb dan.
You are the only one.	Int l-uniku wieħed.
I didn’t have enough time.	Ma kellix biżżejjed ħin.
I hadn’t thought about that.	Ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan.
Probably the first.	Probabbilment l-ewwel.
You don't seem to have it.	Inti ma jidhirx li għandek.
I told the truth.	Jien għedt il-verità.
It’s not getting any easier.	Mhux qed isir aktar faċli.
It was so great to work with.	Kien tant kbir biex jaħdem miegħu.
There was more now.	Kien hemm aktar issa.
I need to go, and so do you.	Għandi bżonn immur, u int ukoll.
I think they are, but maybe not for everyone.	Naħseb li huma, imma forsi mhux għal kulħadd.
But it was always there.	Imma dejjem kien hemm.
Not so for everyone.	Mhux hekk għal kulħadd.
Not much, but little.	Mhux ħafna, imma ftit.
No one is there.	Ħadd mhu hemm.
Now let’s get here.	Issa ejja hawn.
Not so much for me.	Mhux tant għalija.
And you only want one.	U trid waħda biss.
No one can be so happy.	Ħadd ma jista’ jkun daqshekk kuntent.
I was saying the same thing.	Jien kont ngħid l-istess ħaġa.
It does.	Jagħmel dan.
You are not coming with us.	M'intix ġej magħna.
He comes and goes as he pleases.	Jiġi u jmur kif irid.
He really was alone now.	Huwa verament kien waħdu issa.
But there are problems.	Imma hemm problemi.
It was working.	Kien jaħdem.
So tired, he thought.	Hekk għajjien, ħaseb.
That wasn’t a big deal either.	Dik lanqas ma kienet xi ħaġa kbira.
It just seems like time to go home.	Jidher biss qisu ħin biex tmur id-dar.
I am nobody and everyone.	Jiena ħadd u kulħadd.
Not now, too early.	Mhux issa, kmieni wisq.
Nobody knew what was going on.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x’kien qed jiġri.
In fact, they were here.	Fil-fatt, kienu hawn.
Such things you know.	Affarijiet bħal dawn taf.
All that, boy.	Dak kollu, tifel.
I never do that.	Jien qatt ma nagħmel hekk.
We always knew when he was around.	Dejjem konna nafu meta kien madwar.
It is very very small.	Huwa żgħir ħafna ħafna.
She was saying something.	Kienet tgħid xi ħaġa.
We are not ours.	Aħna mhux tagħna.
You don't even know.	Lanqas taf.
Everyone knew this, and everyone knew it at the time.	Kulħadd jaf dan, u kulħadd kien jaf dak iż-żmien.
It was the first time she had been there.	Kienet l-ewwel darba li kienet hemm.
His certainly wasn’t.	Tiegħu żgur li ma kienx.
But only for a short time.	Imma għal ftit żmien biss.
I have this.	Għandi dan.
Here you go.	Hawn tmur.
I knew too little.	Kont naf ftit wisq.
It would have been great.	Kien ikun kbir.
And we are.	U aħna.
You can't say anything.	Ma tista’ tgħid xejn.
And it was great.	U kienet kbira.
I didn’t.	Jien ma kontx.
There you are.	Hemmhekk int.
No one had left.	Ħadd ma kien telaq.
That’s how far you go.	Dak sa fejn tmur.
There is only one problem.	Hemm problema waħda biss.
The problem is as follows.	Il-problema hija kif ġej.
Not a man.	Mhux raġel.
I’m glad you and not me.	Jien ferħan li int u mhux jien.
I still don't know.	Għadni ma nafx.
Not after what just happened.	Mhux wara dak li għadu kif ġara.
And maybe he is.	U forsi hu.
I know the following.	Naf li ġej.
Surely I’ve been able to see this happen.	Żgur li stajt nara dan jiġri.
I’m pretty sure of that.	Jien pjuttost ċert minn dan.
I don’t quite understand that.	Jien ma tantx nifhem dan.
I will try to do it later today.	Nipprova nagħmel aktar tard illum.
This will be my job.	Dan se jkun ix-xogħol tiegħi.
It was hours late.	Kienet sigħat tard.
I would really like to see this.	Nixtieq verament nara dan.
Besides, he was right.	Barra minn hekk, kellu raġun.
He must have died.	Huwa għandu jkun miet.
What is unlikely will not.	Dak li ma x'aktarx mhux se.
About everyone and everything.	Dwar kulħadd u kollox.
All now.	Kollha issa.
And if not.	U jekk le.
He wasn't going to see anything else.	Ma kien se jara xi ħaġa oħra.
Not so much fun.	Mhux daqshekk gost.
I have to go back.	Għandi nerġa' lura.
It's probably too late.	Probabbilment jerġa’ jkun tard.
I can't.	Jien ma nistax.
And so they often were.	U hekk kienu spiss.
Almost easy money.	Kważi flus faċli.
We can be like that.	Aħna nistgħu nkunu hekk.
That's for sure.	Dak żgur.
You are one of his.	Int wieħed minn tiegħu.
You need one.	Għandek bżonn wieħed.
Not to eat, of course.	Mhux biex tiekol, ovvjament.
Much is the same.	Ħafna huwa l-istess.
But of course he had to.	Imma ovvjament kellu.
It's for everyone.	Huwa għal kulħadd.
You can't do me.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel lili.
But no one will ever know this.	Imma ħadd qatt mhu se jkun jaf dan.
He went back, he couldn't do another.	Huwa mar lura, ma setax jagħmel ieħor.
he asked.	staqsa.
Now we can no longer.	Issa ma nistgħux aktar.
When he got home.	Meta wasal id-dar.
But most people never do.	Imma ħafna nies qatt ma jagħmlu.
This is what he had come up with.	Dan huwa dak li kien wasal għalih.
We know they are.	Nafu li huma.
Nothing was enough.	Xejn ma kien biżżejjed.
I can't understand the problem.	Ma nistax nifhem il-problema.
If it were.	Kieku kien.
I went there.	Jien mort hemm.
Its fun !!!! 	Tiegħu gost!!!!
Like, rather than like, like.	Bħal, aktar milli bħal, bħal.
He still needs some work.	Għadu bżonn xi xogħol.
Same thing, you'll get these.	L-istess ħaġa, int ser tieħu dawn.
I can't today.	Ma nistax illum.
Have a good job.	Ikollu xogħol tajjeb.
I was the last.	Jien kont l-aħħar.
It’s not working for me.	Mhux qed jaħdem għalija.
Apparently, she wasn't.	Milli jidher, ma kinitx hi.
I didn't even know what it was.	Lanqas kont naf x’kien.
Everyone said so.	Kulħadd qal hekk.
Well before it was.	Ukoll qabel kien.
Nothing was done.	Xejn ma sar.
And a good one, on that.	U waħda tajba, fuq dak.
He will never be the same.	Hu qatt ma jkun l-istess.
He was doing it.	Kien jagħmel dan.
I was before.	Jien kont qabel.
Just for you.	Għalik biss.
So it is done.	Hekk isir.
It doesn’t seem to have been enough.	Ma jidhirx li kien biżżejjed.
I don’t know why a man says so.	Ma nafx għaliex raġel jgħid hekk.
This is not happening.	Dan mhux qed jiġri.
No one lives here now.	Ħadd ma jgħix hawn issa.
Maybe this is the first one.	Forsi din hija l-ewwel waħda.
But the first wrong was not his.	Imma l-ewwel ħażin ma kienx tiegħu.
And this is too bad.	U dan huwa ħażin wisq.
And not too much if you can.	U mhux wisq jekk tista’.
He had little to say.	Ftit kellu xi jgħid.
I was worried about my friend.	Kont inkwetat dwar ħabib tiegħi.
Don’t be a kid like that.	Tkunx tifel bħal dan.
We will always know almost nothing.	Dejjem se nkunu nafu kważi xejn.
This could not be right.	Dan ma setax ikun tajjeb.
But it may be too late.	Imma jista’ jkun tard wisq.
Not someone you don’t even know.	Mhux xi ħadd li lanqas biss taf.
It could happen again.	Jista’ jerġa’ jiġri.
He came to me.	Wasal għandi.
This now.	Dan issa.
First, help if you are ready.	L-ewwel, jgħin jekk inti lest.
He speaks like a child.	Titkellem bħal tifel.
I wish he did.	Nixtieq li għamel.
If you are.	Jekk int.
He was alone.	Kien waħdu.
I have to go so wrong.	Ikolli mmur daqshekk ħażin.
I really really want to.	Verament verament irrid.
Is my book ready?	Il-ktieb tiegħi lest?
It can't have happened.	Ma jistax ikun ġara.
There is no one else.	M'hemm ħadd ieħor.
He often works at home.	Ħafna drabi jaħdem id-dar.
It was only once.	Kien darba biss.
That's exactly what happened.	Hekk ġara eżatt.
I'm his friend.	Jien ħabib tiegħu.
And he is right.	U għandu raġun.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
These were.	Dawn kienu.
Who knows, maybe it will.	Min jaf, forsi se.
Little was needed.	Ftit kien hemm bżonn.
Not sure about that.	Mhux ċert dwar dan.
And it stays that way for hours.	U jibqa' hekk għal sigħat.
Come now.	Ejja issa.
That he did.	Li għamel.
It will be busy here.	Se jkun okkupat hawn.
And it could be better.	U jista 'jkun aħjar.
I'll tell you something.	Jien ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
You say that to no one.	Tgħid hekk lil ħadd.
He didn't know what to do with it.	Ma kienx jaf x’għandu jagħmel b’dan kollu.
I went to your house.	Mort id-dar tiegħek.
I’m very, very good.	Jien tajjeb ħafna, tajjeb ħafna.
He was surprised he was surprised.	Kien sorpriż li kien sorpriż.
Same thing again.	L-istess ħaġa mill-ġdid.
She does now.	Hija tagħmel issa.
And so he died.	U hekk miet.
And it was probably nothing.	U probabbilment kien xejn.
Or they seem to do.	Jew jidher li jagħmlu.
They are just there, and they are what they are.	Huma biss hemm, u huma dak li huma.
This was done very well.	Dan sar tajjeb ħafna.
You are doing this again.	Int qed tagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
It had started well enough.	Kien beda tajjeb biżżejjed.
I didn’t know when you would be.	Ma kontx naf meta inti tkun.
And he was small.	U kien żgħir.
I couldn’t be.	Ma stajtx inkun.
Here's something wrong.	Hawn xi ħaġa ħażina.
It's easy to see why.	Huwa faċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
This is what is happening here.	Dan huwa dak li qed jiġri hawn.
Nothing would be easy.	Xejn ma jkun faċli.
not for now.	mhux għal issa.
Whoever is someone is there.	Kull min hu xi ħadd qiegħed hemm.
But it doesn’t seem likely.	Imma ma jidhirx probabbli.
It was easier that way.	Kien aktar faċli hekk.
No one knows why.	Ħadd ma jaf għaliex.
He’s like a boy.	Huwa bħal tifel.
Does anyone know anything?	Xi ħadd jaf xi ħaġa?
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi mhux.
I know you know how.	Naf li taf kif.
It had been so long.	Kien ilu tant.
That time now.	Dak iż-żmien issa.
That was mine we were.	Dak kien tiegħi konna.
More on that soon.	Aktar dwar dan dalwaqt.
I know me.	Naf min.
It’s time to just say no.	Wasal iż-żmien li ngħid biss, le.
Who owns this house?	Min għandu din id-dar?
And this is why.	U dan huwa għaliex.
I'm doing much better.	Jien sejjer ħafna aħjar.
I know I didn’t.	Naf li ma kontx.
All very well.	Kollha tajjeb ħafna.
He had done it.	Huwa kien għamel dan.
But it probably isn’t.	Imma probabbilment ma jkunx.
Today, you are alone.	Illum, int biss.
He never did anything wrong with me like some people.	Qatt ma għamel xejn ħażin miegħi bħal xi nies.
But no one does.	Imma ħadd ma jagħmel hekk.
I think it worked.	Naħseb li kien jaħdem.
This will be good.	Dan se tajjeb.
No one lived there anymore.	Ħadd ma kien jgħix hemm aktar.
I have something to say.	Għandi xi ngħid.
We are better than this.	Aħna aħjar minn dan.
But he won't.	Imma hu mhux se.
That is how we know what was supposed to happen.	Li huwa kif nafu dak li suppost kellu jiġri.
I never want to be friends with you!	Qatt ma rrid inkun ħbieb miegħek!
Think a little about why this is happening.	Taħseb ftit għaliex dan qed jiġri.
It really is so bad.	Verament huwa daqshekk ħażin.
And boy, never.	U tifel, qatt.
Ma.	Ma.
But you’re about three years too late.	Imma int madwar tliet snin tard wisq.
I had never done this before.	Qatt ma kont għamilt dan qabel.
I just got so tired doing it.	I biss għajjien tant tagħmel dan.
But now you know.	Imma issa taf.
I thought it was you.	Ħsibt li kont int.
It was quite small.	Kien pjuttost żgħir.
He thought no one knew.	Huwa ħaseb li ħadd ma kien jaf.
And so he did.	U hekk għamel hu.
I would like to go.	Nixtieq immur.
They were doing well.	Kienu jagħmlu tajjeb.
Like it wasn’t really happening.	Bħal ma kienx qed jiġri verament.
He does not speak.	Jitkellem hu ma.
Let's go back.	Ejja lura.
But that's not the case.	Imma dak mhux hekk.
Not beautiful at all.	Mhux sabiħa xejn.
I have been doing this for years.	Ilni nagħmel hekk għal snin.
He was almost right.	Kważi kellu raġun.
my people.	nies tiegħi.
No one ever told me.	Ħadd qatt ma qalli.
You have to be able to do these things.	Int trid tkun kapaċi tagħmel dawn l-affarijiet.
I can do that.	Jien nista' nagħmel dan.
I never thought about how I got there.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar kif wasal hemm.
This is you and be sure.	Dan qed tkun int u tkun ċert.
It is not easy.	Mhix xi ħaġa faċli.
They are as follows.	Huma kif ġej.
I think this is the last thing we need.	Naħseb li din hija l-aħħar ħaġa li għandna bżonn.
I have a good job.	Għandi xogħol tajjeb.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Sa dak iż-żmien xejn ma seta’ jagħmel.
It still is.	Għadu hekk.
Good morning work.	Xogħol ta’ filgħodu mhux ħażin.
Nothing was, it seemed.	Xejn ma kien, deher.
Everything else was great.	Kollox ieħor kien kbir.
For a while.	Għal ftit żmien.
He certainly didn't have time.	Żgur li ma kellux ħin.
I'm sure you'll do well.	Jien ċert li inti ser tagħmel tajjeb.
Never be ready.	Qatt ma tkun lest.
Maybe nothing can.	Forsi xejn ma jista’.
It’s time to go.	Wasal iż-żmien li tmur.
He will have a job here.	Se jkollu xogħol hawn.
No one else is here.	Ħadd ieħor mhu hawn.
There was no money for that.	Ma kienx hemm flus għal dan.
It takes a lot of time.	Huwa jieħu ħafna ħin.
This is what happened here tonight.	Dan huwa dak li ġara hawn illejla.
I don’t know how to make it out of this.	Ma nafx kif nagħmel minn dan.
It just was so much more than that.	Biss kien ħafna aktar minn hekk.
There is only one problem.	Hemm problema waħda biss.
It was hard to tell.	Kien diffiċli li tgħid.
And so would you.	U hekk kieku int.
And she was.	U kienet kienet.
It was something to say.	Kienet xi ħaġa li tgħid.
I can’t do this alone.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi.
Look better.	Ħares aħjar.
That was bad enough for him.	Dan kien ħażin biżżejjed għalih.
He was good to me.	Kien tajjeb miegħi.
He passed me by.	Huwa għadda lili.
You can never tell.	Qatt ma tista’ tgħid.
She was very beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa ħafna.
That would be.	Li tkun.
I’m actually pretty good at it.	Jien fil-fatt pjuttost tajjeb.
But he did little work.	Imma ma tantx għamel xogħol.
I knew it all the time.	Kont naf il-ħin kollu.
I’m not sure there’s anything else.	M'inix ċert li hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
I've been talking to a friend lately.	Kont qed nitkellem ma’ ħabib dan l-aħħar.
To do this again.	Biex tagħmel dan għal darba oħra mill-ġdid.
It's hard to say.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid.
But that’s not about it.	Imma dan mhux dwar dan.
It doesn’t look good.	Ma jidhirx tajjeb.
No one knew what to do.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
She looked exactly as she looked now.	Hija kienet tidher eżatt kif kienet tidher issa.
He has a job.	Għandu xogħol.
I'll be back in a few hours.	Ser inkun lura fi ftit sigħat.
I don't even know what it is.	Lanqas naf x’inhu.
This was going to happen soon.	Dan kien se jiġri malajr.
And on.	U fuq.
It may not be good, but it is there.	Jista’ jkun li ma jkunx wieħed tajjeb, imma qiegħed hemm.
Not something like that.	Mhux xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I think it should be you.	Naħseb li għandu jkun int.
They felt something was wrong.	Ħassu xi ħaġa ħażina.
I thought not.	Ħsibt li le.
This is how you go here.	Dan huwa kif tmur hawn.
It wasn’t nearly enough.	Ma kienx kważi biżżejjed.
Nothing too much please.	Xejn wisq jekk jogħġbok.
You are what you are not.	Int dak li mhux.
I had an idea.	Kelli idea.
It will never happen.	Qatt mhu se jiġri.
And you.	U int.
I can ask my friend.	Nista’ nistaqsi lil ħabib tiegħi.
Not that either.	Mhux dan ukoll.
It will do.	Se tagħmel.
Now, let’s do this properly.	Issa, ejja nagħmlu dan kif suppost.
This is too late to be out.	Dan huwa tard biex tkun barra.
I want it to come.	Irrid li tiġi.
Try something else.	Ipprova xi ħaġa oħra.
Before that, a teacher.	Qabel dan, għalliem.
And so we do.	U hekk nagħmlu.
That's a lot.	Dak ħafna.
There are too many.	Hemm wisq.
I didn’t know where I was planning to go next.	Ma kontx naf fejn kont qed tippjana li tmur wara.
I knew this a long time ago.	Dan kont naf ħafna żmien ilu.
There is no such thing as finished.	M'hemm l-ebda ħaġa bħal lest.
I try not to, he said.	Nipprova ma, qal.
It was still early.	Kien għadu kmieni.
She may never be.	Jista’ jkun li hi qatt ma tkun.
Now he was interested.	Issa kien interessat.
It's pretty late.	Huwa pjuttost tard.
This was the first.	Dan kien l-ewwel.
No, he was not far behind.	Le, ma kienx jibqa’ lura.
Why is this happening?	Għaliex qed jiġri dan?
Only one can help.	Wieħed biss jista 'jgħin.
Probably nothing too big.	Probabbilment xejn kbir wisq.
And that must be enough.	U dan irid ikun biżżejjed.
Not even a little.	Lanqas ftit.
I was there I was.	Jien kont kont hemm jien.
And you should know mine.	U għandek tkun taf tiegħi.
He could have tried.	Kieku seta’ jipprova.
Maybe she knew something.	Forsi kienet tkun taf xi ħaġa.
You definitely don’t want to.	Int żgur li ma tridx.
It looks good and is working well.	Jidher tajjeb u qed jaħdem tajjeb.
This should help.	Dan għandu jgħin.
It's so easy you can do it now.	Huwa daqshekk faċli li tista 'tagħmel dan issa.
You do the same thing.	Inti tagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
Soon, all will.	Dalwaqt, kollha se.
He didn't know where the top one came from.	Ma kienx jaf minn fejn ġie dak ta’ fuq.
Much, much, more.	Ħafna, ħafna, aktar.
I like that a lot.	Nixtieq dak ħafna.
That's ready.	Dak lest.
A young boy was with him.	Tifel żgħir kien miegħu.
I don’t know the same.	Ma nafx l-istess.
I want to know who did this.	Irrid inkun naf min għamel dan.
No, really, you want to.	Le, tassew, trid.
And he knew it was me too.	U kien jaf li kont jien ukoll.
It must be really great.	Għandu jkun verament kbir.
It must be difficult.	Għandu jkun diffiċli.
Everyone is talking about it.	Kulħadd qed jitkellem dwarha.
I did something I didn’t want to do.	Għamilt xi ħaġa li ma ridtx.
Or the last.	Jew l-aħħar.
It wasn't good.	Ma kienx tajjeb.
This is where you should sit and eat.	Dan huwa fejn suppost għandek toqgħod u tiekol.
And that was really what we were after.	U dan kien verament dak li konna wara.
I just know.	Jien biss naf.
He knew he couldn't win.	Kien jaf li ma setax jirbaħ.
Maybe he did.	Forsi hekk għamel.
We hardly knew where we were.	Ma tantx konna nafu fejn konna.
He is not eating much.	Mhux qed jiekol ħafna.
And maybe she was.	U forsi kienet kienet.
He was sure he had never seen this before.	Kien ċert li qatt ma kien ra dan qabel.
I would be buying more !.	Inkun qed nixtri aktar!.
I'm with you on that.	Jien miegħek fuq dak.
Or a man.	Jew raġel.
No one is ever happy around here.	Ħadd qatt ma kuntent madwar hawn.
Most likely.	Wisq probabbli.
It's just.	Huwa biss.
I should be ready by now.	I għandu jkun lest sa issa.
Of course he could come.	Ovvjament seta’ jasal.
Who will do this first ?.	Min se jagħmel dan l-ewwel?.
He had everything he could ever want.	Kellu dak kollu li jista’ qatt irid.
I was just a kid, nobody told me anything.	Kont biss tifel, ħadd ma qalli xejn.
Well, he was probably right.	Ukoll, x'aktarx kellu raġun.
That’s pretty much what seems to be happening.	Dak huwa pjuttost dak li jidher li qed jiġri.
He wasn’t ready for that.	Ma kienx lest għal dan.
Or not.	Jew le.
She just knew she was there.	Kienet taf biss li kien hemm.
There were many people doing this, not just one.	Kienu ħafna nies jagħmlu dan, mhux wieħed biss.
We are not doing this right now.	Aħna mhux qed nagħmlu dan bħalissa.
U.	U.
I’ve never done this, well, ever.	Jien qatt ma għamilt dan, ukoll, qatt.
She knew better.	Kienet taf aħjar.
Everyone was happy.	Kulħadd kien kuntent.
Here’s something I’ve never seen before.	Hawn xi ħaġa li qatt ma ra qabel.
It was early in the morning.	Kien kmieni filgħodu.
But he wanted to know more.	Imma ried ikun jaf aktar.
I heard a lot.	Smajt ħafna.
She was not.	Hija ma kinitx.
I don’t think it was.	Ma naħsibx li kien.
But that was great.	Imma dak kien kbir.
I'm talking now.	Jien nitkellem issa.
There is no one out here.	M'hemm ħadd hawn barra.
There was nothing more.	Ma kien hemm xejn aktar.
The only thing.	L-unika ħaġa.
I would be happy.	Inkun kuntent.
It looks really bad, you know.	Hija tidher tassew ħażina, taf.
I'm the only one who can do that.	Jien l-uniku wieħed li jista’ jagħmel dan.
That and that there was someone with me.	Dik u li kien hemm xi ħadd miegħi.
You're a busy man.	Int raġel okkupat.
Really, not so bad.	Tassew, mhux daqshekk ħażin.
I didn’t want to tell you.	Ma riedx ngħidlek.
But he knew what to do.	Imma kien jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
Dan se tara.	Dan se tara.
I thought about it for a long time.	Ħsibt dwarha għal żmien twil.
I stay there for a while.	Jien noqgħod hemm xi żmien.
She had had enough of this.	Hija kellha biżżejjed minn dan.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kinitx.
I was having fun.	Kont nieħu gost.
It was good.	Kien tajjeb.
But of course it would.	Imma ovvjament kieku.
Not sure how that happened.	Mhux ċert kif ġara dan.
I had no idea what he was doing.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'kien qed jagħmel.
I’ve never seen anything like that.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal dik.
You are really beautiful.	Int tassew sabiħa.
No one else can reach it.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jasal għalih.
He was so tired.	Huwa kien tant għajjien.
She wants to know you.	Hija trid tkun taf inti.
Now I have a boy playing.	Issa għandi tifel jilgħab.
But he did, and he was.	Imma għamel, u kien.
It will do very well.	Hija se tagħmel tajjeb ħafna.
They are all sitting together.	Huma kollha bilqiegħda flimkien.
Great job.	Xogħol kbir.
Same with his.	L-istess ma’ tiegħu.
That’s what it says.	Dak huwa dak li jgħid.
He was watching.	Kien jara.
I hope so.	Nispera.
If it’s good for us, great.	Jekk hemm tajjeb għalina, kbir.
Obviously we are not.	Ovvjament aħna le.
Well not really.	Ukoll mhux verament.
She was talking and talking.	Kienet titkellem u titkellem.
It's too small a size.	Huwa daqs żgħir wisq.
It would have been so much easier that way.	Kien ikun ħafna aktar faċli hekk.
They won't.	Huma mhux se.
Not my friend.	Mhux ħabib tiegħi.
You can only do this many times.	Tista 'biss tagħmel dan ħafna drabi.
I'm just tired.	Jien biss għajjien.
I can’t take that.	Ma nistax nieħu dan.
He knows why.	Jaf għaliex.
What he lost was something he really never had.	Dak li tilef kienet xi ħaġa li verament qatt ma kellu.
I have never seen anyone like this.	Qatt ma rajt lil ħadd bħal dan.
He seemed to think about it.	Deher li jaħseb dwarha.
There was more, much more.	Kien hemm aktar, ħafna aktar.
I wasn’t going to say anything.	Jien ma kont se ngħid xejn.
I want him to say something, like what he knows.	Nixtieq li jgħid xi ħaġa, bħal dak li jaf.
Nobody wants anything.	Ħadd ma jrid xejn.
It's for you.	Huwa għalik.
She won't be now.	Hija mhux se tkun issa.
I can tell when he's having fun and when he's not.	Jien nista’ ngħid meta qed jieħu gost u meta ma jkunx.
But you can never be too sure.	Imma qatt ma tista’ tkun ċert wisq.
We don’t need one.	M'għandniex bżonn wieħed.
I didn’t have to sit there and do nothing.	Ma kellix għalfejn noqgħod hemm u ma nagħmel xejn.
To tell you.	Biex ngħidlek.
I want to talk to you when you can.	Nixtieq nitkellem miegħek meta tista'.
There	Hemm
There is a lot of money out there.	Hemm ħafna flus hemmhekk.
And he asked.	U talab.
He wanted nothing.	Ma ried xejn.
In a short time he came.	Fi ftit ħin ġie.
If you do, you are not.	Jekk tagħmel hekk, m'intix.
But of course we knew it was coming.	Imma ovvjament konna nafu li kien ġej.
That was something more.	Din kienet xi ħaġa aktar.
I wonder if this book worked for me.	Nistaqsi jekk dan il-ktieb kienx jaħdem għalija.
Well, not really.	Ukoll, fil-fatt le.
I thought maybe come and do it.	Ħsibt li forsi tiġi u tagħmel dan.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwar dan.
Not very good.	Mhux tajjeb ħafna.
I’m going to be out a lot, a long time.	Jien ser inkun barra ħafna, żmien twil.
There was nothing to see.	Ma kien hemm xejn biex nara.
It will not be enough.	Mhux se jkun biżżejjed.
Just the first few.	Biss l-ewwel ftit.
It doesn’t do it all the time.	Ma jagħmilx il-ħin kollu.
I can't tell you now.	Ma nistax ngħidlek issa.
for everything else! 	għal kull ħaġa oħra!
I can go there.	Nista' mmur hemm.
It is much more than that.	Huwa ħafna aktar minn hekk.
Either it will or it won’t.	Jew se jew le.
U.	U .
It wasn’t him.	Ma kienx hu.
Little did she do well.	Ftit li xejn għamlet tajjeb.
I have no idea what will happen to me next.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'se jiġri lili wara.
I would never say anything like that.	Qatt ma ngħid xi ħaġa bħal dik.
He actually did nothing to find out.	Fil-fatt ma għamel xejn biex isir jaf.
If you wish.	Jekk tixtieq.
Mine was not.	Tiegħi ma kienx.
He entered the room.	Huwa daħal fil-kamra.
It’s what we need most of all.	Huwa dak li għandna bżonn aktar minn kull ħaġa.
That's if they do.	Dak jekk jagħmlu.
I’m not really sure.	M'inix ċert tassew.
I couldn’t tell what happened next.	Ma stajtx ngħid x'ġara wara.
Or there it was.	Jew kien hemm.
Come with me now.	Ejja miegħi issa.
I’m a bit small for that.	Jien daqsxejn żgħir għal dak.
We can do better.	Nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar.
It was him or us.	Kien hu jew aħna.
Too happy for a while.	Ferħan wisq għal ftit żmien.
She was talking fast.	Kienet titkellem malajr.
I have to be the first.	Jien għandi nkun l-ewwel.
I knew how hard he had tried.	Kont naf kemm kien ipprova.
It’s time for a lot of things.	Wasal iż-żmien għal ħafna affarijiet.
I know you are right.	Naf li għandek raġun.
No one else is going.	Ħadd ieħor mhu sejjer.
Until the end.	Sa l-aħħar.
I wish he was here.	Nixtieq li kien hawn.
That's where you want to be.	Dak fejn trid tkun.
Tell me what you need to say.	Għid dak li għandek bżonn tgħid.
It wasn't good.	Ma kinitx tajba.
It's just something to do.	Hija biss xi ħaġa li għandhom jagħmlu.
He had to say something.	Kellu jgħid xi ħaġa.
That's it.	Din hija dik.
Everyone was busy.	Kulħadd kien okkupat.
I want to know who did this.	Irrid inkun naf min għamel dan.
In addition, the work is often more difficult.	Barra minn hekk, ix-xogħol spiss ikun aktar diffiċli.
But a lot of fun.	Imma ħafna gost.
And now, said enough, you are tired.	U issa, qal biżżejjed, inti għajjien.
But this was never done.	Imma dan qatt ma sar.
Look good for me.	Ħares tajjeb għalija.
Is there anything you can do about it?	Hemm xi ħaġa li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan?
So it was.	Hekk kien.
I think you’re really on to something here.	Naħseb li int verament fuq xi ħaġa hawn.
I just had to ask.	Kelli biss nistaqsi.
I know all about it.	Naf kollox dwarha.
They will probably do that.	Probabbilment se jagħmlu dan.
For a while.	Għal xi żmien.
I was going to say the same thing.	Kont se ngħid l-istess ħaġa.
I didn't know what it was.	Ma kontx naf x’kien.
Like, besides everything.	Bħal, barra minn kollox.
I can see that happening.	Nista' nara li jiġri.
You don’t want it to look like that.	Ma tridx li jidher hekk.
Well, it’s too small for me.	Ukoll, huwa żgħir wisq għalija.
He can't leave with that.	Huwa ma jistax jitlaq ma 'dan.
I want out.	Irrid barra.
It wasn't just mine.	Ma kienx tiegħi biss.
You can do it and you will do it.	Tista 'tagħmel dan u int se tagħmel dan.
He wasn't sure how it happened.	Ma kienx ċert kif ġara.
Whatever.	Tkun xi tkun.
You are too young.	Inti żgħir wisq.
I know my doing.	Naf tiegħi tagħmel.
But he can't.	Imma ma jistax.
It is a small time.	Hija żmien żgħir.
It took a while.	Ħa ftit.
It couldn’t have been there.	Ma setax kien hemm.
As long as you want.	Sakemm trid.
You can tell.	Inti tista 'tgħid.
Nothing was ever good enough.	Xejn qatt ma kien tajjeb biżżejjed.
This looked bad.	Dan deher ħażin.
No one could return to him.	Ħadd ma seta’ jerġa’ lura għandu.
I have some money.	Għandi xi flus.
There was no such man.	Ma kienx hemm raġel bħal dan.
I'm worried.	Jien inkwetat.
Well, now they do.	Ukoll, issa jagħmlu.
You may not be able to do this on your own.	Jista' jkun li ma tkunx tista' tagħmel dan waħdek.
About time, too.	Dwar iż-żmien, ukoll.
Many times.	Ħafna drabi.
I want the same thing.	Nixtieq l-istess ħaġa.
Sorry you can't do that.	Jiddispjaċini li ma tistax tagħmel.
It’s something to see.	Hija xi ħaġa li tara.
He asked that so.	Talab li hekk.
I know who this is.	Naf min hu dan.
That’s another man altogether.	Dak huwa raġel ieħor għal kollox.
He saw nothing.	Ma ra xejn.
Is that really what it looks like?	Huwa verament dak li jidher?
But she had friends.	Imma kellha ħbieb.
Nobody knew anything.	Ħadd ma kien jaf xejn.
And often, they won't.	U ħafna drabi, dawn mhux se.
He came back after a long time.	Ġie lura wara żmien twil.
It shouldn’t have come, he thinks.	Ma kellux jiġi, jaħseb.
I want you.	Nixtieq li inti.
He will live forever.	Se jgħix għal dejjem.
That was really hard for me.	Dak kien tassew diffiċli għalija.
And so it is.	U hekk hu.
It was not so before.	Ma kienx hekk qabel.
But this cannot be.	Imma dan ma jistax ikun.
They will not later.	Huma mhux se aktar tard.
But this is not good enough.	Imma dan mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
There is no talking.	M'hemm l-ebda titkellem.
I never wanted anyone else.	Qatt ma ridt lil ħadd aktar.
We will be back for sure !.	Se nkunu lura żgur!.
I can go alone.	Nista’ mmur waħdi.
That ever was.	Li qatt kien.
But one thing seems likely.	Imma ħaġa waħda tidher probabbli.
Or, perhaps, never.	Jew, forsi, qatt.
He knew fast enough.	Huwa kien jaf malajr biżżejjed.
Not before, and not now.	Mhux qabel, u mhux issa.
He knew it was going to go wrong as well.	Kien jaf li kienet se tmur ħażin ukoll.
I was too busy.	Kont okkupat wisq.
I couldn't see.	Ma stajtx nara.
You want to know what that is.	Trid tkun taf x'inhu dak.
And we do.	U nagħmlu.
And you know us.	U taf aħna.
Which of course it was.	Li ovvjament kienet.
But she wants one.	Imma hi tixtieq waħda.
Never, ever thought of you.	Qatt, qatt ma ħsibt li inti.
He never knew exactly why.	Hu qatt ma kien jaf eżatt għaliex.
Usually I was the only one.	Normalment kont l-uniku wieħed.
One needs to know one.	Jeħtieġ li wieħed ikun jaf wieħed.
When he saw you there.	Meta ra inti hemmhekk.
I didn’t think she was actually going to go.	Ma kontx naħseb li fil-fatt kienet se tmur.
We do everything together.	Nagħmlu kollox flimkien.
I’m sure there’s nothing out there.	Jien ċert li m'hemm xejn hemmhekk.
I’m not sure why it’s not working.	M'inix ċert għaliex mhux qed jaħdem.
He didn’t need to.	Ma kellux bżonn.
It looks pretty good.	Jidher pjuttost tajjeb.
She says she will.	Tgħid li se.
It was so much more than that.	Kien ħafna aktar minn hekk.
The first good one.	L-ewwel waħda tajba.
It will be a good time !.	Se jkun żmien tajjeb!.
Nothing big, nothing big.	Xejn kbir, xejn kbir.
Here's mine.	Hawn tiegħi.
Not the first time.	Mhux l-ewwel darba.
He is here with us.	Huwa hawn magħna.
This is done.	Dan isir.
I never want that to anyone.	Qatt ma nixtieq dak lil ħadd.
He would be waiting, for sure.	Huwa jkun qed jistenna, żgur.
She can't do anything.	Hija ma tistax tagħmel xejn.
It was too hard to tell.	Kien diffiċli wisq biex tgħid.
But it actually happened.	Imma fil-fatt ġara.
She just had no idea where.	Hija biss kellha l-ebda idea fejn.
And about that.	U dwar dan.
I really need to talk to him.	Għandi verament bżonn nitkellem miegħu.
But we have a lot of time together.	Imma għandna ħafna ħin flimkien.
It is, in fact.	Hija, fil-fatt.
It has been a long time.	Kien hemm żmien twil.
Faster, he thought.	Aktar malajr, ħaseb.
They felt.	Ħassu.
There are many.	Hemm ħafna.
I know what you want.	Naf xi trid.
If not today, tomorrow, soon.	Jekk mhux illum, għada, dalwaqt.
Everyone knows everyone.	Kulħadd jaf lil kulħadd.
And about time.	U dwar iż-żmien.
Very bad, very bad.	Ħażin ħafna, ħażin ħafna.
And no one did anything about it.	U ħadd ma għamel xejn dwarha.
That’s what actually happened.	Dak hu li fil-fatt ġara.
Try this book.	Ipprova dan il-ktieb.
But this is not for everyone.	Imma dan mhux għal kulħadd.
I hope you are happy.	Nispera li int kuntent.
The same, he could not.	L-istess, ma setax.
There was someone.	Kien hemm xi ħadd.
You can stay.	Tista' toqgħod.
I can't even eat.	Lanqas nista’ niekol.
And so it began.	U hekk beda.
I wasn't even tired.	Jien lanqas kont għajjien.
He passed out.	Huwa għadda barra.
Probably you.	Probabbilment int.
It wasn't just today.	Ma kienx illum biss.
Nothing too happy.	Xejn wisq kuntent.
I really, really, hope so.	Jien tassew, tassew, nittama li hekk.
Maybe tomorrow would come.	Forsi għada kienet tiġi.
That must be it.	Dak irid ikun.
Nothing happened.	Ma ġara xejn.
Nothing was done.	Ma sar xejn.
There were not enough people.	Ma kienx hemm biżżejjed nies.
Don't try anything.	Ma jipprova xejn.
That was a very good idea.	Dik kienet idea tajba ħafna.
She.	Hija.
And that should be easy.	U dan għandu jkun faċli.
There is, of course, much more.	Hemm, ovvjament, ħafna aktar.
I really love my job.	Verament inħobb ix-xogħol tiegħi.
That had to go.	Dak kellu jmur.
And he had friends.	U kellu ħbieb.
And that really is saying something.	U dan verament qed jgħid xi ħaġa.
And you will too.	U int tkun ukoll.
It could be both.	Jista 'jkun it-tnejn.
He is doing nothing to help.	Hu mhu qed jagħmel xejn biex jgħin.
But it’s not working for me.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem għalija.
I’m still the same man.	Għadni l-istess raġel.
Everyone was fine.	Kulħadd kien tajjeb.
That's what happened here.	Hekk ġara hawn.
I'm coming to him.	Jien ġej għandu.
I really don't.	Jien verament ma.
Or rather, they are.	Jew aħjar, huma.
He just can't seem to.	Huwa biss ma jistax jidher li.
I will do so.	Jien se nagħmel hekk.
I love everything about it.	Inħobb kollox dwarha.
Nothing and everything.	Xejn u kollox.
I'm very glad.	Jien ferħan ħafna.
I think we could be so much better.	Naħseb li nistgħu nkunu ħafna aħjar.
This is what needs to happen.	Dan huwa dak li jeħtieġ li jiġri.
You were there, and so you were.	Int kont hemm, u hekk kont.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwarha.
I couldn’t go back to that.	Ma stajtx immur lura għal dak.
And that was that.	U dak kien dak.
I just don’t know where to go from here.	Jien biss ma nafx fejn immur minn hawn.
She had had enough of that.	Hija kellha biżżejjed minn dak.
I have a lot of these.	Għandi ħafna minn dawn.
Earlier this week.	Aktar kmieni din il-ġimgħa.
He doesn't look happy.	Ma jidhirx kuntent.
Everything seems to be working fine.	Jidher li kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
It was there before.	Kien hemm qabel.
One, when you have done something wrong.	Wieħed, meta tkun għamilt xi ħaġa ħażina.
I can do this better than he can.	Jien nista' nagħmel dan aħjar milli jista' hu.
He took a chance.	Huwa ħa ċans.
It was an easy job.	Kienet xogħol faċli.
He sure knew for quite some time.	Huwa żgur li kien jaf għal żmien mhux ħażin.
We knew it was going to take some time.	Konna nafu li kien se jieħu ftit ħin.
Come with me.	Ejja miegħi.
I went to school.	Mort l-iskola.
He arrived late today.	Huwa wasal tard illum.
Someone else does it for you.	Xi ħadd ieħor jagħmel dan għalik.
That’s good enough for me.	Dak tajjeb biżżejjed għalija.
Go.	Tmur.
He is my friend.	Hu ħabib tiegħi.
And so he did.	U hekk għamel.
One could never go back.	Wieħed qatt ma seta’ jmur lura.
She was doing it.	Kienet tagħmel dan.
I’m fine, really.	Jien tajjeb, tassew.
Come on, come on with me.	Ejja, ejja miegħi.
Well, almost no one.	Ukoll, kważi ħadd.
I'm not afraid either.	Lanqas nibża’.
And the time had come.	U kien wasal iż-żmien.
Don't come here.	M'għandekx ġejt hawn.
I had to go there.	Kelli mmur hemm.
But that was really good for me.	Imma dan kien tassew tajjeb għalija.
I think he will play again.	Naħseb li se jerġa jilgħab.
You had enough to eat.	Kellek biżżejjed biex tiekol.
Well done.	Tajjeb għamilna.
And here it is, again.	U hawn kien, jerġa' jiġri.
He has no friends.	M’għandux ħbieb.
Maybe she didn’t know this either.	Forsi ma kinitx taf dan lanqas.
They never do, but you never know.	Huma qatt ma jagħmlu, imma int qatt ma tkun taf.
Not sure about that either.	Mhux ċert fuq dan lanqas.
He did not want to leave.	Ma riedx jitlaq.
Of many things.	Ta’ ħafna affarijiet.
I don’t know anything about it really.	Jien ma naf xejn dwarha verament.
We do.	Aħna nagħmlu.
Nor was it so bad.	Lanqas ma kienet daqshekk ħażina.
But it would be good to go.	Imma jkun tajjeb li mmur.
It seems to be working for us.	Jidher li qed jaħdem għalina.
Well, that was good.	Ukoll, li kienet tajba.
Or so it seems.	Jew hekk jidher.
I said so.	Jien għidt hekk.
Now, it seems to stay there.	Issa, jidher li jibqa' hemm.
But there is nothing.	Imma m'hemm xejn.
And it may be happening now.	U jista 'jkun qed jiġri issa.
This is what you do.	Dan huwa dak li tagħmel.
And she sees.	U hi tara.
I heard about it.	Smajt dwar dan.
Just a bit of fun.	Biss daqsxejn ta 'gost.
He wasn’t able to say anything else.	Ma kien kapaċi jgħid xi ħaġa oħra.
He couldn't really see anything.	Huwa ma seta 'verament jara xejn.
It's too early.	Għadu kmieni wisq.
Maybe he is.	Forsi hu.
I know not.	Naf li mhux.
But what he knew now was enough.	Imma dak li kien jaf issa kien biżżejjed.
There is no one else out there.	M'hemm ħadd ieħor hemmhekk.
He agreed to talk to me.	Huwa qabel li jitkellem miegħi.
You have to be ready for everything.	Trid tkun lest għal kollox.
It would be good for you.	Ikun tajjeb għalik.
Or she had to do.	Jew kellha tagħmel.
But you don’t know.	Imma ma tkunx taf.
Maybe I did.	Forsi għamilt.
I don’t even eat anything.	Lanqas ma niekol xejn.
That’s what he needs most.	Dak hu li jeħtieġ aktar.
I could see he was scared.	Stajt nara li kien qed jibża’.
I also don’t know if I’m doing well.	Ma nafx ukoll jekk nagħmel tajjeb.
There is a lot of time.	Hemm ħafna ħin.
It was the same as before.	Kien l-istess bħal ta’ qabel.
I like a lot of things.	Inħobb ħafna affarijiet.
About the same as back home.	Madwar l-istess bħal lura d-dar.
As you wish.	Kif tixtieq.
Here was a man.	Hawn kien raġel.
But that’s all I’m talking about.	Imma dak jien nitkellem biss.
Nothing seemed to happen.	Ma deher li ġara xejn.
And she is not.	U hi mhix.
But it was easy.	Imma kien faċli.
But there was a problem.	Imma kien hemm problema.
This was actually happening.	Dan fil-fatt kien qed jiġri.
But it may not be for everyone.	Imma jista’ ma jkunx għal kulħadd.
He hardly wanted to talk about it.	Ma tantx ried jitkellem dwarha.
And so it goes.	U hekk imur.
I’m not the only one.	Jien mhux l-uniku wieħed.
I almost died last night.	I kważi miet ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
In fact, he does.	Fil-fatt, huwa jagħmel.
There was a lot to see.	Kien hemm ħafna x'tara.
It probably was.	Probabbilment kien.
He probably didn’t have time to leave.	Probabbilment ma kellux ħin jitlaq.
No one is saying so.	Ħadd mhu qed jgħid hekk.
You just need to do it.	Għandek bżonn biss li tagħmel dan.
We never do.	Aħna qatt ma nagħmlu.
But it will.	Imma se.
The house was beautiful.	Id-dar kienet sabiħa.
There was so much.	Kien hemm tant.
All you can do is be there.	Kull ma tista’ tagħmel hu li tkun hemm.
I don’t want that.	Ma rridx hekk.
And that’s something you can’t be.	U dik hija xi ħaġa li ma tistax tkun.
It could have been for something.	Seta’ kien għal xi ħaġa.
So he thinks.	Hekk jaħseb.
Or do you think you do.	Jew taħseb li tagħmel.
Someone was coming.	Kien ġej xi ħadd.
It's useless for us.	Hu ta’ xejn għalina.
For one thing.	Għal ħaġa.
Well, she says.	Ukoll, tgħid hi.
Well, sure he is.	Ukoll, żgur li hu.
I want to make mine.	Irrid nagħmel tiegħi.
It's much better.	Huwa ħafna aħjar.
That was them.	Dak kienu huma.
Is that all you have to say?	Huwa dak kollu li għandek xi tgħid?
I was waiting for the next one.	Jien kont qed nistenna li ġej.
He was doing something for me.	Kien jagħmel xi ħaġa għalija.
Everyone wants it that way.	Kulħadd irid hekk.
They are just a bit of fun.	Huma biss daqsxejn ta 'gost.
I’m not worried about that.	Jien mhux inkwetat dwar dan.
I heard about it.	Smajt dwar dan.
What they do.	Dak li jagħmlu.
You are not taking.	M'intix qed tieħu.
I want that for you.	Irrid li għalik.
You did very well.	Int għamilt tajjeb ħafna.
You can go now, if you want.	Tista' tmur issa, jekk trid.
I know what this looks like, but.	Naf kif jidher dan, imma.
Nothing, and never.	Xejn, u qatt.
I couldn’t even try.	Lanqas stajt nipprova.
And everyone knew it.	U kulħadd kien jaf dan.
It's not very big.	Mhuwiex kbir ħafna.
I don’t know anything more.	Jien ma naf xejn aktar.
They were doing more.	Huma kienu qed jagħmlu aktar.
He came after.	Huwa ġie wara.
I know how to do it.	Naf kif nagħmel dan.
But probably not.	Imma probabbilment le.
Nothing happens without you knowing.	Xejn ma jiġri mingħajr ma tkun taf.
He was watching.	Kien qed jara.
She knows that.	Hija taf li.
I'm sure it will do well !.	Jien ċert li se tagħmel tajjeb!.
He waited a bit and went back.	Huwa kien jistenna ftit u jmur lura.
Everything fits together.	Kollox joqgħod flimkien.
It couldn’t be done.	Ma setax isir.
He had just had enough.	Huwa kien biss kellu biżżejjed.
I thought it was a great idea.	Ħsibt li kienet idea kbira.
More, more of me.	Aktar, aktar minni.
Now, on to why you’re here.	Issa, fuq għaliex int hawn.
We are good enough of the latter.	Aħna tajjeb biżżejjed ta 'dan ta' l-aħħar.
And look there.	U ħares hemm.
It couldn’t have been easier !.	Ma setax ikun aktar faċli!.
I have not much to say.	Għandi ma tantx nitkellem.
It’s everything and nothing and a few things.	Huwa kollox u xejn u ftit affarijiet.
I really can’t understand what happened.	Verament ma nistax nifhem x'ġara.
I don't know how.	Ma nafx kif.
Whatever you have, you have to.	Tkun xi tkun għandek, għandek.
I don’t want that.	Ma rridx dan.
I knew it was you.	Kont naf li kont int.
He was happy.	Kien kuntent.
And so it was.	U hekk kien.
There are many things that happen that way.	Hemm ħafna affarijiet li jiġri hekk.
It was a really good way to think.	Kien mod tassew tajjeb biex taħseb.
It’s too early.	Għadu kmieni wisq.
I will be happy to be with you.	Se nieħu gost inkun miegħek.
You think you know what you want.	Taħseb li taf dak li trid.
I just don't.	Jien biss ma.
I knew what was going on.	Kont naf x’kien qed jiġri.
I didn’t know anything.	Jien ma kont naf xejn.
She will speak only once.	Hija se titkellem darba biss.
It doesn’t even look bad.	Hija lanqas tidher ħażina.
This is done as follows.	Dan isir kif ġej.
Hard for everyone, probably.	Diffiċli għal kulħadd, probabbilment.
There is nothing to say.	M'hemm xejn xi ngħid.
I just don’t know how.	Jien biss ma nafx kif.
The truth is that it is for everyone.	Il-verità hi li hija għal kulħadd.
It can happen.	Huwa jista 'jiġri.
First no.	L-ewwel le.
That will not be easy.	Dak mhux se jkun faċli.
That morning.	Dak filgħodu.
He just did everything he had to do to win.	Huwa biss għamel dak kollu li kellu jagħmel biex jirbaħ.
You will do what I said.	Inti se tagħmel dak li għidt.
He saw things.	Huwa ra l-affarijiet.
There wasn’t much to say.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna xi ngħid.
And not nearly enough.	U mhux kważi biżżejjed.
We have to go.	Irridu mmorru.
He was driving the car.	Huwa kien qed isuq il-karozza.
You must make your way.	Int trid tagħmel mod tiegħek.
But that doesn’t seem to help.	Imma dan ma jidhirx li jgħin.
I haven’t told anyone about it.	Jien ma għedt lil ħadd dwar dan.
It doesn't have to.	M’għandux għalfejn.
I so wanted to.	Jien hekk ridt.
And you.	U int.
That was so bad, what happened.	Dak kien daqshekk ħażin, dak li ġara.
I don't think so.	Ma naħsibx li.
No more time to think now.	Mhux aktar ħin biex taħseb issa.
He didn’t want to go.	Ma riedx imur.
Also, he didn’t like talking about things.	Barra minn hekk, ma kienx iħobb jitkellem dwar affarijiet.
Nobody knows.	Ħadd ma jaf.
I’ve been there for a while.	Kont hemm għal xi żmien.
I'm there.	Jien hemm.
I’ve been thinking about this for a long time.	Ħsibt dwar dan għal żmien twil.
What does it look like?	Kif jidher?
If not for me.	Jekk mhux għalija.
I like to buy.	Inħobb nixtri.
Nothing is coming.	Xejn mhu ġej.
And who knows, maybe he is.	U min jaf, forsi hu.
I think she was right.	Naħseb li kellha raġun.
In fact, most people do.	Fil-fatt, ħafna nies jagħmlu.
There is another.	Hemm ieħor.
It's done.	Huwa sar.
I didn’t think I was.	Ma kontx naħseb li kont.
You can't stand behind this.	Ma tistax toqgħod wara dan.
And it is.	U huwa.
I can only hear you now.	Nista 'biss nisma' inti issa.
And not just us.	U mhux aħna biss.
It doesn’t look good.	Ma jidhirx tajjeb.
He needed another.	Huwa kellu bżonn ieħor.
I couldn't believe it.	Ma setax nemmen.
But he wanted to.	Imma ried.
She did it.	Hija għamlet dan.
Maybe she was there too.	Forsi hi kienet hemm ukoll.
But here's the truth.	Imma hawn il-verità.
No one can do it alone.	Ħadd ma jista’ jagħmel waħdu.
This may not be enough.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx biżżejjed.
That's a good one.	Dik hija waħda tajba.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
Nothing like this here, of course.	Xejn bħal dan hawn, ovvjament.
This was our home.	Din kienet id-dar tagħna.
But she had to know better.	Imma hi kellha tkun taf aħjar.
I have some of my own money.	Għandi xi flus tiegħi.
He would never say anything like that.	Qatt ma kien jgħid xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I don’t know why this happens.	Ma nafx għalfejn jiġri dan.
Tell no one.	Tgħid lil ħadd.
And there he sat down.	U hemm poġġa bilqiegħda.
And it works very well.	U jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
There is nothing there.	M'hemm xejn hemm.
Too small, not right for you, without without without.	Żgħir wisq, mhux tajjeb għalik, bla bla bla.
he asked.	staqsa.
Unless it was bad.	Sakemm ma kienx ħażin.
I could understand why.	Stajt nifhem għaliex.
I didn’t think it was a big deal.	Ma kontx naħseb li kien xi ħaġa kbira.
I don’t do things like that.	Jien ma nagħmel affarijiet bħal dawn.
What he was doing felt.	Dak li kien qed jagħmel ħassu.
They have never been so before.	Qatt ma kienu hekk qabel.
That was a while ago.	Dan kien ftit ilu.
He just thought it was.	Huwa biss ħaseb li kien.
This is how we do it.	Dan huwa kif nagħmlu dan.
And it didn’t seem easy.	U ma deherx faċli.
I can see you doing.	Nista 'nara li inti tagħmel.
It was a pretty difficult problem.	Kienet problema pjuttost diffiċli.
I have to say no.	Ikolli ngħid le.
The dog had to stay out.	Il-kelb kellu jibqa’ barra.
Let me see.	Ħa nara.
I would, too.	Inkun, ukoll.
There was really nothing that could be done about it.	Verament ma kien hemm xejn li wieħed jista’ jagħmel għalih.
But there it was.	Imma kien hemm.
She had to do it now.	Kellha tagħmel dan issa.
He didn't even seem to know what was going on.	Lanqas ma deher li kien jaf x’kien qed jiġri.
He’s a “can do” man.	Huwa raġel "jista' jagħmel".
Same thing every time.	L-istess ħaġa kull darba.
I’ll get back to that.	Jien ser nerġa 'lura għal dak.
That’s not everyone, of course.	Dan mhux kulħadd, ovvjament.
Unless she does.	Sakemm hi ma.
It is now, too.	Huwa issa, ukoll.
We were never the same.	Qatt ma konna l-istess.
A year before.	Sena qabel.
He wanted more, much more.	Ried aktar, ħafna aktar.
It's on the outside.	Huwa fuq barra.
I was happy for him.	Kont kuntent għalih.
This is not easy.	Dan mhux faċli.
Three hours late.	Tliet sigħat tard.
It was so much help.	Kienet tant għajnuna.
And they were.	U kienu.
I’m the only one who can do that.	Jien l-uniku wieħed li jista 'jagħmel dan.
There had to be a lot of crap.	Ried ikun hemm ħażin ħafna.
It’s good enough, and it sure will be good enough.	Huwa tajjeb biżżejjed, u żgur li se jkun tajjeb biżżejjed.
I can stay with everyone.	Jien nista' noqgħod ma' kulħadd.
I don’t think it’s still there.	Ma naħsibx li għadu hemm.
We did a little.	Għamilna ftit.
It’s just a way, much better than anything else.	Huwa biss mod, ħafna aħjar minn kull ħaġa oħra.
I want to be better tomorrow.	Irrid inkun aħjar għada.
Nothing like this has ever happened.	Xejn bħal dan qatt ma ġara.
I’m glad you’re being nice to him.	Jien ferħan li qed tkun sabiħa miegħu.
He would not be able to do that.	Ma kienx se jkun jista’ jagħmel dan.
You have to do it.	Għandek tagħmel dan.
I will not be back.	Mhux se nkun lura.
And there is nothing you can do about it.	U m'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
I have this.	Għandi dan.
If you want to do that, fine.	Jekk trid tagħmel dan, tajjeb.
I may not have much time.	Jista’ ma tantx ikolli ħin.
And there was nothing.	U ma kien hemm xejn.
And that's it.	U dak hu.
Not with me.	Mhux miegħi.
There is something wrong here.	Hemm xi ħaġa ħażina hawn.
I think it was.	Naħseb li kienet.
And, of course,.	U, ovvjament,.
I have no idea how to do this.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif nagħmel dan.
And maybe he was right.	U forsi kellu raġun.
Sorry if this is not enough for you.	Jiddispjaċini jekk dan mhux biżżejjed għalik.
No one went to see him.	Ħadd ma mar jara.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
I really wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or not.	Verament ma kontx ċert jekk dik kinitx xi ħaġa tajba jew le.
I would like to know better.	Nixtieq inkun naf aħjar.
At the time he said everything was fine.	Dak iż-żmien qal li kollox kien tajjeb.
It definitely has to fit.	Żgur li għandu joqgħod.
But it doesn't have to be.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun.
So it was with me.	Hekk kien miegħi.
She doesn't want to go.	Hi ma tridx tmur.
All this.	Dan kollu.
Many times, it wasn’t.	Ħafna drabi, ma kienx.
She will be here.	Hija ser tkun hawn.
Or maybe it wasn’t like that at all.	Jew forsi ma kien hekk xejn.
There has to be something we can do.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa li nistgħu nagħmlu.
But you can do it.	Imma int tista 'tagħmel dan.
.	.
We don't have people.	M’għandniex nies.
He had gone.	Huwa kellu mar.
And no more.	U mhux aktar.
She was going, she looked back.	Hija kienet se, hija ħares lura.
This has become more and more difficult.	Dan sar aktar u aktar diffiċli.
Nobody knows what happened there.	Ħadd ma jaf x’ġara hemmhekk.
I don't want to say anything.	Ma rrid ngħid lil xejn.
There really is none.	Verament m'hemm l-ebda.
But that was for later.	Imma dan kien għal aktar tard.
Please do this for me?	Jekk jogħġbok tagħmel dan għalija?
Everything has been working fine.	Kollox ilu jaħdem tajjeb.
I was too young to know anything about it.	Kont żgħir wisq biex tkun taf xi ħaġa dwarha.
Often in the evening.	Ħafna drabi ta’ filgħaxija.
I was a person.	Jien kont persuna.
But it never happened.	Imma qatt ma ġara.
There were a few people around.	Kien hemm ftit nies madwar.
Also, no.	Barra minn hekk, l-ebda.
I'm sure you're tired.	Jien ċert li int għajjien.
I need to know that you can do this.	Għandi bżonn inkun naf li inti tista 'tagħmel dan.
I was too.	Jien kont ukoll.
Don't go back !.	Le tmur lura!.
You don't do that.	Inti ma tagħmilx hekk.
I know this.	Naf dan.
The timing is not right.	Il-ħin mhux tajjeb.
Everyone should be happy.	Kulħadd kellu jkun kuntent.
But there is something more.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa aktar.
Maybe you should stay home today.	Forsi għandek toqgħod id-dar illum.
Put it there, he thinks.	Poġġa hemm, jaħseb.
Everyone was happy for him.	Kulħadd kien kuntent għalih.
Maybe you want to talk.	Forsi trid titkellem.
That had to be good.	Dak kellu jkun tajjeb.
Or do so.	Jew jagħmel hekk.
It was very good.	Kien tajjeb ħafna.
I try to be interested.	Nipprova nkun interessat.
I don’t want you to think so.	Ma rridx li taħseb hekk.
I haven’t thought about that book in years.	Ilni snin ma naħseb dwar dak il-ktieb.
He didn't want to say.	Ma riedx jgħid.
It’s hard to say this early on.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid dan kmieni.
For many people, this is a great thing.	Għal ħafna nies, din hija ħaġa kbira.
Until a few years ago.	Sa ftit snin ilu.
He couldn’t have.	Ma setax ikollu.
Another three hours.	Tliet sigħat oħra.
Not alone.	Mhux waħdi.
I would be interested to hear more.	Inkun interessat li nisma' aktar.
I will not do that.	Jien mhux se nagħmel dan.
I saw it today.	Rajt illum.
Well, it works.	Ukoll, jaħdem.
It won’t be long now.	Mhux se jkun twil issa.
We were right to do so.	Kellna raġun nagħmlu hekk.
Yours will be too.	Tiegħek se jkun ukoll.
It looks like but.	Qisu imma.
That has never happened before.	Dak qatt ma ġara qabel.
Nothing came out.	Xejn ħareġ.
I don’t have to believe it.	M'għandix għalfejn nemmen.
Soon after, he died.	Ftit wara, miet.
Hopefully so.	Wieħed żgur jittama li hekk.
But no, certainly not.	Imma le, żgur mhux hekk.
But not both.	Imma mhux it-tnejn.
I didn’t want to do that.	Ma ridtx nagħmel dan.
We don’t have that here.	M'għandniex dan hawn.
That was supposed to be a good thing.	Huwa suppost li din kienet ħaġa tajba.
Now say no.	Issa tgħid le.
To do this, she needed to eat.	Biex tagħmel dan, kellha bżonn tiekol.
He will do it again.	Se jerġa' jagħmel dan.
I'm not the only one who can do that.	Jien mhux l-uniku wieħed li jista 'jagħmel dan.
Everything was fine.	Kollox kien kif suppost.
But he did not know that he had left.	Imma ma kienx jaf li kien telaq.
Maybe there isn’t.	Forsi ma jkunx hemm.
Nothing here for him.	Xejn hawn għalih.
Always know where she is.	Dejjem tkun taf fejn hi.
Now everything should work properly.	Issa kollox għandu jaħdem kif suppost.
It will not be easy.	Mhux se jkun faċli.
I don’t want anyone to see this.	Ma rrid li xi ħadd jara dan.
Chances are she won't.	Huwa probabbli li hi mhux se.
But that was good for him.	Imma dan kien tajjeb għalih.
It has been forever.	Ilu għal dejjem.
But try it.	Imma ipprova.
I thought it was for me.	Ħsibt li kont għalija.
Come to that.	Wasal għal dak.
He was not more than a year old.	Huwa ma kienx aktar minn sena.
He couldn’t have both.	Ma setax ikollu t-tnejn.
I had to tell someone, someone.	Kelli ngħid lil xi ħadd, lil xi ħadd.
But one is enough, for sure.	Imma wieħed huwa biżżejjed, żgur.
But that was too much for me to understand.	Imma dan kien wisq għalija biex nifhem.
But just for you.	Imma għalik biss.
Can you see?	Tista 'tara?
I'm a teacher.	Jien għalliem.
Where something can happen.	Fejn jista’ jiġri xi ħaġa.
One is small and one big.	Wieħed huwa żgħir u wieħed kbir.
It works there.	Jaħdem hemm.
Maybe he’s busy.	Forsi hu okkupat.
It has to do with what it is.	Hija tagħmel ma 'dak li hu.
That had to be so.	Dak kellu jkun hekk.
A lot of things like that.	Ħafna affarijiet bħal dik.
It would not help.	Hija ma tkunx għajnuna.
So does everyone.	Hekk jagħmel kulħadd.
But we probably don’t.	Imma x'aktarx m'għandniex.
For other people, not for me.	Għal nies oħra, mhux għalija.
And something else.	U xi ħaġa oħra.
I’ve never been there before today.	Qatt ma kont hemm qabel illum.
Everyone is surprised.	Kulħadd huwa sorpriż.
He arrived late, after everyone had left.	Huwa wasal tard, wara li kulħadd kien telaq.
It will not happen again.	Mhux se jerġa' jiġri.
It was great for him to see that.	Kien kbir għalih li jara dan.
He left alone.	Telaq waħdu.
And there it is.	U hemm.
It will never be the same!	Qatt mhu se jkun l-istess!
Wherever he wants to go.	Fejn ikun irid imur.
There would be another.	Ikun hemm ieħor.
We may not.	Aħna forsi le.
I went to see what was going on.	Jien kont mort biex nara x’kien qed jiġri.
That or maybe you did something wrong.	Dak jew forsi għamilt xi ħaġa ħażin.
No, one was not.	Le, wieħed ma kienx.
You did well.	Int għamilt tajjeb.
But that’s not really much.	Imma dak mhux verament ħafna.
To do so.	Li jagħmel dan.
It's very easy.	Huwa faċli ħafna.
He had no idea how.	Ma kellux idea kif.
I'm not good.	Jien mhux tajjeb.
She had many friends.	Kellha ħafna ħbieb.
A boy seemed to happen outside.	Tifel deher jiġri barra.
It happens in the morning.	Jiġri filgħodu.
You know what's right and what's wrong.	Taf x’inhu tajjeb u x’inhu ħażin.
I did it myself.	Jien għamilt dan jien.
I don’t know how to do that.	Ma nafx kif jagħmlu dan.
You will be easy.	Int tkun faċli.
Maybe this is what will work for you as well.	Forsi dan hu li se jaħdem għalik ukoll.
But he knew too much.	Imma kien jaf wisq.
It looked like.	Deher qisu.
And you never know about these things.	U qatt ma tkun taf dwar dawn l-affarijiet.
It happens, it’s there.	Jiġri, qiegħed hemm.
Not great, not good either.	Mhux kbir, lanqas tajjeb.
But this will not happen.	Imma dan mhux se jiġri.
It was probably nothing.	Probabbilment kien xejn.
I want to go there.	Nixtieq li mmorru hemm.
That will surely be soon.	Dak żgur li jkun dalwaqt.
You know how to do it now.	Inti taf kif tagħmel dan issa.
It took me a few hours to get there.	Ħa ftit sigħat biex wasal hemm.
This is you.	Dan int.
It was time.	Kien wasal iż-żmien.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Jien ma nafx x'inhu jiġri.
No one saw anything.	Ħadd ma ra xejn.
I don’t want to talk anymore.	Ma rridx nitkellem aktar.
One in the morning, one in the afternoon.	Waħda filgħodu, waħda wara nofsinhar.
He will do very well.	Huwa se jagħmel tajjeb ħafna.
But there were problems.	Imma kien hemm problemi.
He was here first.	Kien hawn l-ewwel.
That was what she was thinking.	Dan kien dak li kienet taħseb.
Not too bad.	Mhux ħażin wisq.
It was easier that way.	Kien aktar faċli hekk.
And that’s what I need.	U dak hu li għandi bżonn.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Int ċert li tixtieq tagħmel dan?
Say what you want about it.	Għid dak li trid dwarha.
You do everything now.	Inti tagħmel kollox issa.
Obviously he told me about it.	Ovvjament qalli dwarha.
Maybe there was really something here.	Forsi kien hemm verament xi ħaġa hawn.
They are my friends.	Huma ħbieb tiegħi.
It was so small.	Kien daqshekk żgħir.
That was what was coming.	Dan kien dak li kien ġej.
Maybe someday it will happen.	Forsi xi darba jiġri.
First time ever.	L-ewwel darba qatt.
This does not know the truth.	Dan ma jkunx jaf il-verità.
For a while.	Għal xi żmien.
You can talk about it if you want.	Tista' titkellem dwarha jekk trid.
I can't do that.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan.
That was my only chance.	Dan kien l-uniku ċans tiegħi.
I didn’t know.	Ma kontx naf.
That was really great.	Dak kien verament kbir.
I can say that she is a pretty nice person.	Nista 'ngħid li hija persuna pjuttost sabiħa.
Not too much to want here.	Mhux wisq li jrid hawn.
If he does, he will not survive.	Jekk jagħmel hekk, ma jgħix.
This is my last one.	Din hija l-aħħar waħda tiegħi.
I’m glad he’ll be there with me.	Jien ferħan li se jkun hemm miegħi.
But that was one.	Imma dik kienet waħda.
I would like to know more about this.	Nixtieq inkun naf aktar dwar dan.
That was bad enough.	Dan kien ħażin biżżejjed.
I think it will be a very good thing.	Naħseb li se tkun ħaġa tajba ħafna.
What you want to see happen.	Xi trid tara jiġri.
But you are the first.	Imma int l-ewwel.
He was right all the time.	Kellu raġun il-ħin kollu.
I want to do that too.	Irrid nagħmel hekk ukoll.
I need to know everything.	Għandi bżonn inkun naf kollox.
We will never know.	Qatt ma nkunu nafu.
Maybe someone else will try.	Jista 'jkun xi ħadd ieħor se jipprova.
What happened happened.	Dak li ġara ġara.
It goes on and on and on.	Imur fuq u fuq u fuq.
Not too much, of course.	Mhux wisq, ovvjament.
Not now there.	Mhux issa qiegħed hemm.
Very good actually.	Tajjeb ħafna fil-fatt.
But definitely not anymore.	Imma żgur mhux aktar.
He enjoys being outside.	Huwa jieħu gost ikun barra.
It would probably be good.	Probabbilment ikun tajjeb.
Are you with us ?.	Int magħna?.
We both were.	It-tnejn li aħna konna.
It plays pretty well.	Jilgħab pjuttost tajjeb.
No, it's not happening.	Le, mhux qed jiġri.
Why are you here?	Għaliex int hawn?
I was surprised how I was.	Jien kont sorpriż kif kont.
No one can leave.	Ħadd ma jista’ jitlaq.
And so it should be.	U hekk suppost tkun.
There was no one.	Ma kien hemm ħadd.
It was too early.	Kien kmieni wisq.
There was none of this here.	Ma kien hemm xejn minn dan hawn.
Whether or not.	Kemm jekk le.
One would have expected.	Wieħed kien jistenna.
And that’s great, too.	U dan huwa kbir, ukoll.
It's just not my thing.	Huwa biss mhux ħaġa tiegħi.
It's for you.	Huwa għalik.
We really do.	Aħna verament nagħmlu.
You have to go get some of that work.	Trid tmur tieħu ftit minn dak ix-xogħol.
A very good one.	Waħda tajba ħafna.
A year ago, that would not have been the case.	Sena ilu, ma kienx ikun hekk.
You did a good job here.	Int għamilt xogħol tajjeb hawn.
Why is this taking so long?	Għaliex dan qed jieħu daqshekk żmien?
I will say no more.	Jien se ngħid mhux aktar.
It should be really scary.	Għandu jkun verament jibża.
He knew what he was going to do.	Kien jaf x’kien se jagħmel.
Too many people.	Wisq nies.
I saw things.	Rajt affarijiet.
I'm good and happy.	Jien tajjeb u kuntent.
Not so it should be, but it is.	Mhux hekk għandu jkun, imma hekk hu.
This never happens.	Dan qatt ma jiġri.
I know this and you know it.	Jien naf dan u int taf li.
They are pretty fast.	Huma pjuttost malajr.
I want my son to be happy.	Irrid li tifel tiegħi jkun kuntent.
He can't say what he is or where he is.	X’inhu jew fejn hu, ma jistax jgħid.
You still think about it, don't you?	Għadek taħseb dwarha, hux?
Forever and forever and ever.	Għal dejjem u għal dejjem u għal dejjem.
But you have to go.	Imma għandek tmur.
People who were around that time.	Nies li kienu madwar dak iż-żmien.
I know we do.	Naf li nagħmlu.
If you had more money.	Kieku kellek aktar flus.
I was scared of that.	Jien kont nibża’ minn hekk.
We are better able.	Aħna kapaċi aħjar.
And so we did.	U hekk għamilna.
It couldn’t be done.	Ma setax isir.
Maybe it wasn't him.	Forsi ma kienx hu.
But it was.	Imma kien.
There would have been time for that, she knew.	Kien ikun hemm żmien għal dan, kienet taf.
It doesn’t do any work as it goes, of course.	Ma tagħmel l-ebda xogħol kif tmur, ovvjament.
We both knew why.	It-tnejn konna nafu għaliex.
This is just the same thing.	Din hija ftit l-istess ħaġa.
There must be a better way.	Għandu jkun hemm mod aħjar.
Maybe more and more.	Forsi aktar u aktar.
I have to say about it.	Irrid ngħid dwarha.
This can be forever.	Dan jista 'jkun għal dejjem.
Nor, of course, is he.	Lanqas, ovvjament, hu.
It may actually work.	Fil-fatt jista 'jaħdem.
She knows something.	Hija taf xi ħaġa.
Maybe he would have.	Forsi kien ikollu.
And another thing.	U ħaġa oħra.
That you never will.	Li int qatt ma se.
Let's go back.	Lura mmorru.
She was there.	Kienet hemm.
I can't help it.	Ma nistax ma.
It seems to be working now.	Jidher li qed jaħdem issa.
This is the only way.	Dan huwa l-uniku mod.
I think this is a good idea.	Naħseb li din hija idea tajba.
Not a good idea.	Mhix idea tajba.
Very good.	Tajjeb ħafna.
And so it is.	U huwa hekk, tant.
I couldn't.	Ma stajtx.
Now everyone does.	Issa kulħadd jagħmel.
Here's what it says.	Hawn dak li jgħid.
He didn't look happy.	Ma deherx kuntent.
I know too.	Naf ukoll.
He was everything to me.	Huwa kien kollox għalija.
Who did this?	Min għamel dan?
But that wasn’t him.	Imma dan ma kienx hu.
Do you come here often?	Tiġi hawn spiss?
It will not happen.	Mhux se jiġri.
This has happened a lot.	Dan ġara ħafna.
If you want, please eat.	Jekk trid, jekk jogħġbok tiekol.
I had enough.	Kelli biżżejjed.
Look at what we have.	Ħares lejn dak li għandna.
Not that you won't already.	Mhux li inti mhux se diġà.
I’m glad no one saw this.	Jien ferħan li ħadd ma ra dan.
That was easy too.	Dan kien faċli wisq.
That's all.	Dak hu biss.
I didn’t really want to know.	Ma tantx ridt inkun naf.
I couldn’t tell you why.	Ma stajtx ngħidlek għaliex.
No, it was a long time after that.	Le, kien żmien twil wara dak.
I didn’t think it was just me.	Ma kontx naħseb li kien biss.
I have you, my friend.	Għandi int, ħabib tiegħi.
I said nothing more.	Ma għidt xejn aktar.
This is pretty easy.	Dan huwa pjuttost faċli.
All these things and more.	Dawn l-affarijiet kollha u aktar.
Not so much here, but.	Mhux tant hawn, imma.
Neither is he.	Lanqas hu.
But he doesn't seem worried.	Imma ma jidhirx li hu inkwetat.
We are not so here.	Aħna mhux hekk hawn.
There was something else he had to do first.	Kien hemm ħaġa oħra li kellu jagħmel l-ewwel.
But you must know.	Imma trid tkun taf.
And we have.	U għandna.
But maybe that was wrong.	Imma forsi dan kien ħażin.
You know how this happens and why.	Taf kif jiġri dan u għaliex.
I would be happy.	Inkun kuntent.
Everyone tried to get there.	Kulħadd ipprova jasal hemm.
I'm afraid he's right.	Nibża’ li għandu raġun.
Well, actually not.	Ukoll, fil-fatt le.
I tell you where he lives.	Ngħidlek fejn jgħix.
I don’t really want to talk to him.	Ma tantx irrid nitkellem miegħu.
I just wonder.	Nistaqsi biss.
Be happy to help.	Ikun kuntent li jgħin.
If something happens, it happens.	Jekk jiġri xi ħaġa, jiġri.
She didn’t know what had happened.	Hija ma kinitx taf x'kien ġara.
You have to stay home.	Għandek toqgħod id-dar.
But still not the same.	Imma għadu mhux l-istess.
I’m a little too tired right now.	Jiena ftit wisq għajjien bħalissa.
He didn’t like to drive.	Ma kienx iħobb isuq.
He just has to leave now.	Huwa għandu biss jitlaq issa.
There is a way to do that.	Hemm xi mod kif tagħmel dan.
Now, not a problem.	Issa, mhux problema.
She had a chance.	Kellha ċans.
Probably a lot.	Probabbilment ħafna.
Not just for me, but for everyone.	Mhux għalija biss, imma għal kulħadd.
And he knows why.	U jaf għaliex.
I don’t think it’s going to happen for a while.	Ma naħsibx li se jiġri għal xi żmien.
Today he told me why.	Illum qalli għaliex.
Mine was the first.	Tiegħi kien l-ewwel.
Let’s be who we are.	Ejja nkunu min aħna.
Surely she knew.	Żgur li kienet taf.
He came home.	Wasal id-dar.
I probably wasn’t just thinking.	Probabbilment ma kontx qed naħseb biss.
It was so.	Kienet hekk.
It can't be.	Ma jistax ikun.
We had time.	Kellna ħin.
She was not doing what she was doing.	Hija ma kinitx tagħmel dak li tagħmel.
Not too late.	Mhux tard wisq.
It had happened to me often.	Kien ġara lili spiss.
I don’t have time to say much more.	M'għandix ħin biex ngħid ħafna aktar.
It's a bad one.	Hija waħda ħażina.
She will be back soon.	Hija ser tkun lura dalwaqt.
Everyone expects them to do so.	Kulħadd jistenna li jagħmlu dan.
You can't stay here!	Ma tistax toqgħod hawn!
A little.	Ftit.
Well, there may be.	Ukoll, jista 'jkun hemm.
You can see that.	Tista 'tara li.
This was not the same.	Dan ma kienx l-istess.
Or, better, me.	Jew, aħjar, lili.
Nothing had happened and he was not doing anything.	Ma kien ġara xejn u ma kien qiegħed jagħmel xejn.
I say things.	Jien ngħid affarijiet.
Whatever.	Tkun xi tkun.
I need money.	Għandi bżonn flus.
We can.	Nistgħu.
It couldn’t help, really.	Ma setax jgħin, tassew.
No one knew where.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn.
By now something bad was happening.	Sa issa kien jiġri xi ħaġa ħażina.
And another thing.	U ħaġa oħra.
Same usually, because you are very busy.	L-istess normalment, għaliex inti okkupat ħafna.
That time has come.	Dak iż-żmien wasal.
I have definitely done so for him for many years.	Żgur li għamilt hekk għalih għal ħafna snin.
He wasn’t even eating.	Lanqas ma kien qed jiekol.
Both of them.	It-tnejn li huma.
There are too many people.	Hemm wisq nies.
You go home.	Tmur id-dar.
Never once.	Qatt mhux darba.
It was really too much.	Kien verament wisq.
This was the house.	Din kienet id-dar.
It took a long time.	Huwa ħa ħafna ħin.
I was thinking too.	Jien kont qed naħseb ukoll.
In fact there are many.	Fil-fatt hemm ħafna.
Now is the time.	Issa wasal iż-żmien.
Come and look.	Ejja u ħares.
I probably don't.	I probabbilment m'għandekx.
But that's not saying much.	Imma dan mhux qed jgħid ħafna.
I'm seeing someone tonight.	Qed nara lil xi ħadd illejla.
I needed both.	Jien kelli bżonn it-tnejn.
Not so long ago they were the same.	Mhux daqshekk twil ilu kienu l-istess.
I do a lot for you.	Jien nagħmel ħafna għalik.
To many, it still seems that way today.	Għal ħafna, għadu jidher hekk illum.
It works every time.	Jaħdem kull darba.
But if he did, he wouldn't stay.	Imma kieku kien hemm, ma kienx jibqa’.
He said he needed some time to think.	Qal li kellu bżonn ftit ħin biex jaħseb.
I’m not interested in all that.	M'iniex interessat fuq dak kollu.
Don't do that!	M'għandekx tagħmel dan!
How much work did you do?	Kemm kont tagħmel xogħol?
Nothing.	Xejn.
He told me to try.	Huwa qalli biex nipprova.
Tom is a great boy.	Tom huwa tifel kbir.
He must do it.	Huwa għandu jagħmel dan.
There are some things you can do to make things better.	Hemm xi affarijiet li tista 'tagħmel, biex tagħmel l-affarijiet aħjar.
I was never there.	Qatt ma kont hemm.
He did not know what he was doing.	Ma kienx jaf x’kien qed jagħmel.
All for one.	Kollha għal waħda.
One thing that.	Ħaġa waħda li.
You are late.	Inti tard.
This is a very good thing.	Din hija ħaġa tajba ħafna.
You're a good man.	Int raġel tajjeb.
Too much.	Wisq.
I am no longer a man.	M'iniex raġel aktar.
She had had enough.	Hija kellha biżżejjed.
But he will be back.	Imma hu se jkun lura.
He was here first.	Kien hawn l-ewwel.
And it needs to happen soon.	U jeħtieġ li jiġri dalwaqt.
I saw this.	Rajt dan.
I'm sorry.	Jiddispjaċini.
We have this.	Għandna dan.
I will not do that again.	Mhux se nerġa' nagħmel hekk.
You did a good job there.	Int għamilt xogħol tajjeb hemmhekk.
It's not over.	Mhuwiex fuq.
But it is a good one.	Imma hija waħda tajba.
I’m not saying anything.	Jien ma ngħid xejn.
It really is.	Huwa tassew.
It won’t be a problem anymore.	Mhux se jkun problema aktar.
I think this can help.	Naħseb li dan jista 'jgħin.
I'm just not.	Jien hekk kif le.
It's not that easy.	Mhuwiex daqshekk faċli.
That was that.	Dak kien dak.
I know I did some of that.	Naf li għamilt xi ftit minn dan.
It's going well.	Huwa sejjer tajjeb.
I just want to go.	Irrid biss immur.
Do you have something to talk about?	Għandek xi ħaġa li trid titkellem dwarha?
He couldn't wait any longer.	Ma setax jistenna aktar.
She didn’t need to say anything.	Ma kellha bżonn tgħid xejn.
Maybe he didn’t need to be here for this.	Forsi ma kellux bżonn ikun hawn għal dan.
No one else knows.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jkun jaf dan.
Like yours and mine.	Bħal tiegħek u tiegħi.
That was a great thing.	Dik kienet ħaġa kbira.
I want your help.	Irrid l-għajnuna tiegħek.
When you are eating, you are eating.	Meta tkun qed tiekol, tiekol.
But no one had come.	Imma ħadd ma kien daħal.
It's his last job.	Huwa l-aħħar xogħol tiegħu.
But a little is not enough.	Imma xi ftit mhux biżżejjed.
Too late.	Tard wisq.
I'm not sure why this is happening.	M'inix ċert għaliex dan qed jiġri.
I just heard a lot.	Jien biss smajt ħafna.
He had little time.	Kellu ftit ħin.
And I'm sorry.	U jiddispjaċini.
We have to do something.	Irridu nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
Or maybe not good.	Jew forsi mhux tajjeb.
I'm scared.	Qed nibża.
But he is not the same.	Imma hu mhux l-istess.
And why not.	U għaliex le.
She doesn’t just want a man.	Hija ma tridx biss raġel.
You.	Inti.
He couldn’t, or sure he was going to do something.	Ma setax, jew żgur li kien se jagħmel xi ħaġa.
I think it’s not supposed to.	Naħseb li mhux suppost.
Have fun, probably.	Tieħu gost, probabbilment.
He had to be there.	Huwa kellu jkun hemm.
It doesn’t have to be a big deal.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun xi ħaġa kbira.
We weren’t making much money.	Ma tantx konna nagħmlu flus.
Better do the same.	Aħjar tagħmel l-istess.
I can’t do anything more.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn aktar.
I’m surprised, actually.	Jien sorpriż, fil-fatt.
So it goes.	Hekk imur.
You are right.	Għandek raġun.
All it is is that.	Kollha tkun hija dik.
I don’t think you want help either.	Ma naħsibx li lanqas trid għajnuna.
It’s so good to be back.	Huwa daqshekk tajjeb li tkun lura.
That one day everything will really be fine.	Li xi darba kollox verament se jkun tajjeb.
Nobody knows.	Ħadd ma jaf.
It was my first job.	Kien l-ewwel xogħol tiegħi.
It's just me.	Huwa biss jien.
It was something great to see.	Kienet xi ħaġa kbira li tara.
That's what he did.	Dak għamel dan.
He always did.	Dejjem għamel.
And you.	U int.
We have where and how, we now need when.	Għandna fejn u kif, issa għandna bżonn meta.
How are you.	Kif inti.
He's coming back soon !.	Huwa ġej lura dalwaqt!.
And it came early.	U wasal kmieni.
It's just so, so.	Huwa biss hekk, hekk.
No one can really say.	Ħadd ma jista 'verament jgħid.
But he is not happy.	Imma hu mhux kuntent.
But it was time for him to go.	Imma kien wasal iż-żmien għalih li jmur.
But this will not happen.	Imma dan mhux se jiġri.
It was me who had a problem with him.	Kien jien li kellu problema miegħu.
There he was.	Hemmhekk kien qiegħed.
He really tries.	Huwa verament jipprova.
You have to think about something else, or someone else.	Għandek taħseb dwar xi ħaġa oħra, jew xi ħadd ieħor.
But it's pretty easy.	Imma huwa pjuttost faċli.
But this will not work.	Imma dan mhux se jaħdem.
You have to do the work for me.	Int trid tagħmel ix-xogħol għalija.
I want to know too.	Irrid inkun naf ukoll.
Everything you could want.	Dak kollu li tista' tixtieq.
This is me.	Dan minni.
No one else can do the job.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jagħmel ix-xogħol.
Tomorrow, the first thing.	Għada, l-ewwel ħaġa.
I did something for you, and you know what.	Għamilt xi ħaġa għalik, u taf x'inhu.
Or if you do.	Jew jekk tagħmel hekk.
It is, and it is not.	Huwa, u mhux.
It will come, he thought, it will come.	Se jiġi, ħaseb, se jiġi.
Can't wait any longer.	Ma jistax jistenna aktar.
It shouldn’t say so.	M'għandux jgħid hekk.
It wouldn’t have been the first time.	Ma kinitx tkun l-ewwel darba.
She had no one else.	Hija ma kellha ħadd ieħor.
That’s a nice thing to say.	Dik hija ħaġa sabiħa li tgħid.
Now, come with me.	Issa, ejja miegħi.
A little surprised, too.	Ftit sorpriż, ukoll.
And it came.	U ġie.
What are they doing?	X'qed jagħmlu?
You will get it wrong.	Inti se tieħu ħażin.
I had never seen such things.	Qatt ma kont rajt affarijiet bħal dawn.
Me and me.	Lili u jien.
Maybe later, not tonight, but tomorrow.	Forsi aktar tard, mhux illejla, imma għada.
He certainly shouldn’t be here, he does.	Huwa żgur m'għandux ikun hawn, jagħmel dan.
This afternoon, probably.	Illum wara nofsinhar, probabbilment.
How do you do.	Kif tagħmel int.
What you have but don’t have.	Dak li għandek imma m'għandekx.
That's not bad.	Dak mhux ħażin.
It seems easy but it’s not.	Jidher faċli imma mhux.
Most people are currently.	Ħafna nies huma bħalissa.
Try before you go wrong.	Ipprova qabel ma tmur ħażin.
It may be no more than it seems.	Jista 'jkun mhux aktar minn dak li jidher.
I’ve never been one before.	Jien qatt ma kont qatt ma kont waħda qabel.
No more.	Mhux aktar minn hekk.
You were good to me.	Int kont tajjeb miegħi.
It does not,.	Jagħmel le,.
More on this next week.	Aktar dwar dan il-ġimgħa d-dieħla.
Hard to see how they will make a lot of money.	Diffiċli biex tara kif se jagħmlu ħafna flus.
It wasn't good.	Ma kienx tajjeb.
It seems to be there.	Jidher li hemm.
And it happened.	U ġara.
I’m a little worried actually.	Għandi xi ftit inkwetat fil-fatt.
I don’t know how it happened.	Ma nafx kif ġara.
It will take much longer.	Se jieħu ħafna aktar żmien.
And this will not happen.	U dan mhux se jiġri.
Nobody knows where you are.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn int.
We know better.	Nafu aħjar.
I knew it was coming.	Kont naf li se jkun ġej.
I was there.	Kont hemm.
He is sure to win.	Huwa żgur li jirbaħ.
As it was.	Hekk kif kienet kienet.
It was a very good time.	Kien żmien tajjeb ħafna.
He wasn’t good, either.	Hu ma kienx tajjeb, lanqas.
You want to want to be better.	Trid trid tkun aħjar.
It would take too long.	Ikun jieħu wisq żmien.
That's it.	Dak hu.
He has to.	Huwa għandu.
Probably just about how you're doing.	Probabbilment biss dwar kif qed tmur.
It is not always so.	Mhux dejjem ikun hekk.
I'm afraid of what's next.	Nibża’ minn dak li jiġi wara.
I hope not as well.	Nispera li mhux ukoll.
But if you want to go, you must.	Imma jekk trid tmur, trid.
He was going to have to leave.	Kien se jkollu jitlaq.
She was never that.	Hija qatt kienet dik.
I will never go back.	Jien qatt mhu se mmur lura.
But that’s not for me.	Imma dak mhux għalija.
It never comes back, it never happens again.	Qatt ma jerġa’ lura, qatt ma jerġa’ jiġri.
It’s the last thing you need.	Hija l-aħħar ħaġa li għandek bżonn.
That was always a problem for him.	Dik dejjem kienet problema għalih.
If he had, he would have done so before.	Kieku kien, kien jagħmel hekk qabel.
Of many things.	Ta’ ħafna affarijiet.
There was another after I came alone.	Kien hemm ieħor wara li ġejt waħdek.
It could be anything.	Jista’ jkun xi ħaġa.
I wish it was me.	Nixtieq li kont jien.
It should be but not.	Għandu jkun imma mhux.
I was having trouble hearing.	Kont qed ikolli problemi biex nisma’.
Not how we do it, of course.	Mhux kif nagħmlu aħna, ovvjament.
That was one thing.	Dik kienet ħaġa waħda.
And she is so tired.	U hi tant għajjien.
It was if.	Kien jekk.
Think about things.	Taħseb dwar l-affarijiet.
But nothing more.	Imma xejn aktar.
Not out yet !.	Għadu mhux barra!.
As well as it can be.	Kif ukoll jista 'jkun.
Now, before it's too late.	Issa, qabel ma jkun tard wisq.
But there is more, much more.	Imma hemm aktar, ħafna aktar.
I never need to know that.	Qatt m’għandi bżonn inkun naf dan.
He didn't have to.	Ma kellux għalfejn.
Well, that interested me.	Ukoll, li interessat lili.
That was little more than nothing.	Li kien ftit aktar minn xejn.
As you can see.	Kif tara.
So beautiful !.	Hekk sabiħa!.
He knew he looked good.	Kien jaf li kien jidher tajjeb.
I don't have to.	M'għandix għalfejn nagħmel.
I don’t think it will ever happen.	Ma naħsibx li qatt se jiġri.
I have to go now.	Għandi mmur issa.
So I said.	Hekk għidt.
I did.	Għamilt.
No one said much.	Ħadd ma qal ħafna.
And not only that.	U mhux dan biss.
I think it’s for me.	Naħseb li hu għalija.
He would stay there again.	Kieku jibqa' hemm mill-ġdid.
You are late.	Inti tard.
And you want to know why.	U trid tkun taf għaliex.
And you know it too.	U taf ukoll.
I have no money now.	M'għandix flus issa.
It’s nothing to me.	Hu xejn għalija.
Until the end.	Sa l-aħħar.
For me, that says a lot.	Għalija, dan jgħid ħafna.
Too late.	Tard wisq.
Everything is happening so fast.	Kollox qed jiġri hekk malajr.
I think it’s going to be a lot of fun.	Naħseb li ser jieħu gost tassew.
It's just that we don't.	Huwa biss li aħna ma.
Whatever you want.	Tkun xi trid.
They are forever.	Huma għal dejjem.
He had not done so for years.	Kien ilu snin ma jagħmel hekk.
You will not stand.	Inti mhux se toqgħod.
But it was too late for that.	Imma kien tard wisq għal dan.
Everything was wrong out here.	Kollox kien ħażin hawn barra.
I'm not sure how much.	M'inix ċert kemm.
You are very capable people.	Int nies kapaċi ħafna.
She knew she was there without looking.	Kienet taf li kien hemm mingħajr ma ħares.
And they looked at each other.	U ħares lejn xulxin.
Time to go me too.	Żmien li mmur jien ukoll.
Everyone here does.	Kulħadd hawn jagħmel.
There was only one other chance.	Kien hemm ċans ieħor wieħed biss.
I was pretty glad.	Kont pjuttost ferħan.
It would be hard to tell.	Ikun diffiċli li wieħed jgħid.
He obviously loves work.	Huwa ovvjament iħobb ix-xogħol.
Or say nothing.	Jew ma tgħid xejn.
I know nothing about it.	Jien ma naf xejn dwarha.
And it’s pretty good.	U huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
But it was great.	Imma kien kbir.
It was a beautiful morning.	Kienet filgħodu sabiħa.
It will not be difficult.	Mhux se jkun diffiċli.
It's actually not.	Huwa fil-fatt mhux.
I didn’t know any of this.	Jien ma kont naf xejn minn dan.
He said.	Hu qal.
She was beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa.
He would often do, you see.	Ħafna drabi kien jagħmel, tara.
And they should.	U għandhom.
Later, i.	Aktar tard, i.
That was harder.	Dak kien aktar diffiċli.
That is happening a lot.	Li qed jiġri ħafna.
It's getting better.	Qed isir aħjar.
You really are a good friend.	Int tassew ħabib tajjeb.
We have to go together tonight.	Irridu mmorru flimkien, illejla.
Sorry, she says.	Jiddispjaċini, tgħid.
She now had only one job.	Issa kellha xogħol wieħed biss.
I hope he lives!	Nittama li jgħix!
I was outside myself.	Jien kont barra jien.
Anything can happen.	Dak kollu jista’ jkollu jiġri.
No job is easy.	L-ebda xogħol mhu faċli.
He would never do these things.	Hu qatt ma kien jagħmel dawn l-affarijiet.
I couldn’t believe it was happening to me.	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien qed jiġri lili.
You should always tell the truth.	Għandek dejjem tgħid il-verità.
You weren’t there.	Int ma kontx hemm.
I would be a better person.	Inkun persuna aħjar.
I'm happy for you.	Jien kuntent għalik.
It was good.	Kienet tajba.
That’s very hard to do.	Dik hija diffiċli ħafna li tagħmel.
Not everyone would have.	Mhux kulħadd kien ikollu.
I know this is a bad time.	Naf li dan huwa żmien ħażin.
Everything takes time.	Kollox jeħtieġ ħin.
That’s just what we do.	Huwa biss dak li nagħmlu.
Whatever they are doing, it is working.	Tkun xi tkun qed jagħmlu, qed jaħdem.
She did a wonderful thing for me.	Hija għamlet ħaġa sabiħa għalija.
I was so ready.	Kont tant lest.
You will do no such thing.	Inti se tagħmel l-ebda ħaġa bħal din.
It was the first time he really thought about it.	Kienet l-ewwel darba li verament ħaseb dwarha.
No one knows where she is.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn hi.
He took the house with him.	Huwa ħa d-dar miegħu.
He was glad he had.	Kien ferħan li kellu.
I hardly heard.	Jien ma tantx smajt.
It won't.	Mhux se.
He lost what was his.	Huwa tilef dak li kien tiegħu.
He will be back soon.	Hu ser ikun lura fi ftit żmien.
But she was not here.	Imma hi ma kinitx hawn.
In fact.	Fil-fatt.
He lost everything.	Huwa tilef kollox.
That would be great.	Dan ikun kbir.
He goes there.	Huwa jmur hemm.
That's pretty good.	Dak pjuttost tajjeb.
We do.	Aħna nagħmlu.
I can say that.	Nista’ ngħid hekk.
There was something else at work, too.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra fuq ix-xogħol, ukoll.
I can do another one like that.	Nista' nagħmel waħda oħra bħal dik.
It won't be long.	Ma jkunx twil.
No one ever does.	Ħadd qatt ma jagħmel.
It's a lot.	Huwa ħafna.
I saw this.	Rajt dan.
No one was talking.	Ħadd ma kien qed jitkellem.
And its last.	U l-aħħar tiegħu.
No one did that.	Ħadd ma għamel hekk.
Okay, he said.	Tajjeb, qal.
You look good.	Inti tidher tajba.
It was still early.	Kien għadu kmieni.
It shouldn’t be too difficult.	M'għandux ikun diffiċli wisq.
I know why you came.	Naf għaliex ġejt.
It’s time for him to speak.	Wasal iż-żmien għalih li jitkellem.
But no one else can.	Imma ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jagħmel dan.
It could happen tomorrow.	Jista' jiġri għada.
But no more.	Imma mhux aktar.
There was a need.	Kien hemm bżonn.
It wasn’t hard enough.	Ma kienx diffiċli biżżejjed.
It shouldn’t be that hard.	M'għandux ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
We don’t have one.	M'għandniex waħda.
Everyone knows this.	Kulħadd jaf dan.
Which is wrong.	Li huwa ħażin.
There.	Hemm.
And it works very well.	U jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
You will do it now.	Int se tagħmel dan issa.
Not a good thing.	Mhix xi ħaġa tajba.
Unless you.	Sakemm int.
I'm very happy.	Jien kuntent ħafna.
But no one will.	Imma ħadd ma se.
No one will have a chance like that again.	Ħadd mhu se jerġa’ jkollu ċans bħal dak.
And it seems to work.	U jidher li jaħdem.
There is no one about.	M'hemm ħadd dwar.
She never did.	Hija qatt ma għamlet.
he said.	hu qal.
Everyone said the same thing, after all.	Kulħadd qal l-istess ħaġa, wara.
I'm a bit busy.	Jien daqsxejn okkupat.
But you can't come with us.	Imma ma tistax tiġi magħna.
And that was just over.	U dak kien biss fuq.
He wants what he can't have.	Irid dak li ma jistax ikollu.
It’s easier to go from here.	Huwa aktar faċli li tmur minn hawn.
I was telling the truth.	Kont qed ngħid il-verità.
Or whatever that is.	Jew tkun xi tkun dik.
I will be back there soon.	Inkun lura hemm fi ftit żmien.
I was thinking about that too.	Jien kont ħsibt dwar dan ukoll.
I was sure.	Kont ċert.
To come or go after.	Biex tiġi jew tmur wara.
This was never going to work.	Dan qatt ma kien se jaħdem.
That wasn’t my home.	Dik ma kinitx id-dar tiegħi.
She did a good job.	Hija għamlet xogħol tajjeb.
I hope it’s not you.	Nispera li mhux int.
I see no way around this.	Ma nara l-ebda mod madwar dan.
I think a man is trying.	Naħseb li raġel qed jipprova.
I was ready to.	Kont lest biex.
I don’t know, not really.	Ma nafx, mhux verament.
Many times.	Ħafna drabi.
But he left.	Imma hu telaq.
He does a job that few people do.	Huwa jagħmel xogħol li ftit nies jagħmlu.
He said for sure.	Huwa qal żgur.
He knew he couldn’t win.	Kien jaf li ma setax jirbaħ.
Not us, they are.	Mhux aħna, huma.
And today he did.	U llum hekk għamel.
I should have died.	I kellha miet.
You don't want to do that.	Inti ma tridx tagħmel dan.
It will be a long time before that happens.	Ikun hemm żmien twil qabel ma jiġri hekk.
It looked like.	Deher qisu.
This is me!	Dan jien!
That is not enough.	Dan mhux biżżejjed.
Well maybe now it is.	Ukoll forsi issa huwa.
Will this work ?.	Dan se jaħdem?.
But you are right.	Imma għandek raġun.
Just like this here.	Eżatt bħal dan hawn.
Maybe I couldn’t.	Forsi ma stajtx.
The week would be good for many.	Il-ġimgħa tkun tajba għal ħafna.
I think it’s really good for everyone.	Naħseb li huwa tassew tajjeb għal kulħadd.
That’s a big problem.	Dik hija problema kbira.
It's just too big.	Huwa biss kbir wisq.
But someone won't.	Imma xi ħadd mhux se.
It's been a year without work.	Ilu sena bla xogħol.
We do the same.	Aħna nagħmlu l-istess.
And you already have one.	U diġà għandek waħda.
Here it comes.	Hawn wasal.
Maybe you can think of something ?.	Forsi tista' taħseb xi ħaġa?.
It wasn't fun.	Ma kienx gost.
This he had.	Dan kellu.
It was hard, so hard.	Kien diffiċli, tant diffiċli.
That it was time.	Li kien wasal iż-żmien.
She can't stay for long.	Hija ma tistax toqgħod għal żmien twil.
Coming and going was not easy.	Ġej u sejjer ma kienx faċli.
The same way.	L-istess mod.
The problem was how.	Il-problema kienet kif.
First, they were together.	L-ewwel, kienu flimkien.
It's still here.	Għadu hawn.
I'll try tomorrow.	Nipprova għada.
Well, obviously it will.	Ukoll, ovvjament se.
But that’s all nothing.	Imma li kollox mhu xejn.
After all, it wasn’t that long ago.	Wara kollox, ma kienx daqshekk twil ilu.
Most of all, he didn’t want to go back.	Aktar minn kollox, ma riedx lura.
And still with me.	U għadu miegħi.
We don’t need more than that.	M'għandniex bżonn aktar minn dan.
And that must remain the case.	U dak irid jibqa’ hekk.
Today she did something she had never done before.	Illum għamlet xi ħaġa li qatt ma kienet għamlet qabel.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
I was really worried about that.	Jien kont verament inkwetat dwar dan.
He is a good man.	Huwa raġel tajjeb.
I understand things.	Nifhem l-affarijiet.
It's someone else.	Huwa xi ħadd ieħor.
There must be people on.	Għandu jkun hemm nies fuq.
I can't do that.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan.
But no, it didn’t have to be.	Imma le, ma kellux ikun.
Nothing to see here.	Xejn x'tara hawn.
He had started now.	Huwa kien beda issa.
He didn’t need to think long.	Ma kellux bżonn jaħseb twil.
At that time there was nowhere to go.	Dak iż-żmien ma kienx hemm fejn tmur.
And this will not be easy.	U dan mhux se jkun faċli.
I'm out.	Jien barra.
But you already know.	Imma int diġà taf.
It will make everything much easier.	Se tagħmel kollox ħafna aktar faċli.
And so, my friends.	U hekk, ħbieb tiegħi.
But that's a good idea.	Imma dik hija idea tajba.
That you want.	Li trid.
And it was great, you know.	U kien kbir, taf.
It couldn’t have been better.	Ma setax ikun aħjar.
I’m sure you know these things.	Jien ċert li taf dawn l-affarijiet.
I went shopping.	Mort nixtri.
He will be ready to go.	Hu se jkun lest biex imur.
You are not supposed to do that.	M'intix suppost tagħmel dan.
But he is not saying anything.	Imma hu mhu qed jgħid xejn.
One or the other.	Wieħed jew ieħor.
You should, too.	Għandek, ukoll.
But it's not here yet.	Imma għadu mhux hawn.
Well, actually it is.	Ukoll, fil-fatt huwa.
I think he should.	Naħseb li għandu.
I hardly understand why you do that.	Ma tantx nifhem għaliex inti tagħmel hekk.
It will not be right for you.	Mhux se jkun tajjeb għalik.
It's not fun.	Mhuwiex gost.
It just isn’t going to happen.	Huwa biss mhux se jiġri.
Just want to.	Biss trid.
I will only do one.	Se nagħmel waħda biss.
I like not knowing.	Jien inħobb ma nafx.
If not now, when ?.	Jekk mhux issa, meta?.
What had happened next.	Dak li kien ġara wara.
And now, here we are.	U issa, hawn konna.
It was ready for me.	Kien lest għalija.
This is the only one.	Dan huwa l-uniku wieħed.
We need more than that.	Għandna bżonn aktar minn dan.
Which is today.	Li huwa llum.
As you may know.	Kif forsi taf.
It doesn’t look bad.	Ma jidhirx ħażin.
It was easy.	Kien faċli.
It was your first.	Kienet l-ewwel tiegħek.
Not just you.	Mhux int biss.
You know where everything is.	Taf fejn hu kollox.
Not all bad, either.	Mhux kollox ħażin, lanqas.
We were there around the same time.	Konna hemm madwar l-istess ħin.
And this was never done.	U dan qatt ma sar.
I know for sure.	Naf li żgur.
But there is much more to it.	Imma hemm ħafna aktar minn hekk.
Maybe someday it would.	Forsi xi darba kieku.
I'm really sorry.	Jien tassew jiddispjaċini.
I'm a good friend.	Jien ħabib tajjeb.
He would be here, if only now, telling the truth.	Kieku hawn, jekk biss issa, kien jgħid il-verità.
Not us.	Mhux aħna.
No problem there either.	L-ebda problema hemm lanqas.
And there's nothing you can do about it.	U ma tista’ tagħmel xejn b’dan.
More and more people are unemployed.	Aktar u aktar nies huma bla xogħol.
Do what you want.	Tagħmel li trid.
And he had done so.	U kien għamel hekk.
It wasn’t there.	Ma kienx hemm.
This is where we are currently.	Dan huwa fejn aħna bħalissa.
If you think you have what it takes.	Jekk taħseb li għandek dak li hemm bżonn.
It’s not trying to be.	Mhux qed jipprova jkun.
There is only one bad thing about it.	Hemm ħaġa waħda ħażina biss dwarha.
Nor was it beautiful.	Lanqas ma kienet sabiħa.
But that was the week before.	Imma dik kienet il-ġimgħa ta’ qabel.
It became something of ours.	Sar xi ħaġa tagħna.
I have more than enough.	Għandi aktar minn biżżejjed.
It was quite busy.	Kien pjuttost okkupat.
Or better, before.	Jew aħjar, qabel.
I really think this works.	Verament naħseb li dan jaħdem.
How right you are.	Kemm għandek raġun.
So he eats outside.	Hekk huwa tiekol barra.
It was not.	Ma kinitx.
I will not do so.	Jien mhux se nagħmel hekk.
But something was very wrong.	Imma xi ħaġa kienet ħażina ħafna.
He could see what she looked like.	Kien jara kif kienet tidher.
It was great.	Kien kbir.
Many, in fact.	Ħafna, fil-fatt.
It may be too late.	Jista’ jkun li nkunu tard wisq.
As we will do now.	Kif se nagħmlu issa.
She didn’t know why.	Ma kinitx taf għaliex.
Good to be good.	Tajjeb li tkun tajjeb.
Too good, actually.	Tajjeb wisq, fil-fatt.
They do well here.	Dawn jagħmlu tajjeb hawn.
This in fact cannot be done.	Dan fil-fatt ma jistax isir.
I want to hear other people do things.	Irrid nisma' nies oħra jagħmlu l-affarijiet.
I'm so so that good.	Jien hekk hekk li tajjeb.
Sorry for that.	Jiddispjaċini għal dan.
But not so sure.	Imma ma tkunx daqshekk ċert.
It can’t be otherwise.	Ma jistax ikun mod ieħor.
That's your job.	Dak ix-xogħol tiegħek.
I don’t know exactly how to tell you this.	Ma nafx eżatt kif ngħidlek dan.
He obviously won't.	Huwa ovvjament mhux se.
He died when he was a child.	Miet meta kien tifel.
I'll try for that.	Jien ser nipprova għal dak.
There was no one there.	Ma kien hemm ħadd hemmhekk.
It's that great.	Huwa dak kbir.
He could hardly speak.	Ma tantx seta’ jitkellem.
He made a lot of money too.	Għamel ħafna flus ukoll.
He has been with us for over a year now.	Huwa magħna għal aktar minn sena issa.
I'm very glad.	Jien ferħan ħafna.
It was easy to do.	Kien faċli li tagħmel.
It remains to be seen whether this will happen.	Wieħed irid jara jekk dan hux se jiġri.
I’ve been able to do all that.	Jien stajt nagħmel dak kollu.
Nothing he ever did.	Xejn qatt ma għamel.
You can see.	Inti tista 'tidher.
It's that.	Huwa dak.
You.	Inti.
She knew that a lot.	Hija kienet taf li ħafna.
How great it was.	Kemm kien kbir.
It makes a little big.	Jagħmel żgħir kbir.
It was very busy.	Kien okkupat ħafna.
I was great.	Kont kbir.
I know it was you.	Naf li kont int.
This was very difficult for me to do.	Dan kien diffiċli ħafna għalija li nagħmel.
But it is working well for me.	Imma qed jaħdem tajjeb għalija.
Now that wasn’t so bad is it? 	Issa li ma kienx daqshekk ħażin hux?
How much more for me.	Kemm aktar għalija.
But of course no one had.	Imma ovvjament ħadd ma kellu.
I couldn’t do that.	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan.
That will be soon.	Li dalwaqt se jkun.
Definitely not tonight.	Żgur li mhux illejla.
And you don't, either.	U inti ma, lanqas.
This should not happen again.	Dan m'għandux jerġa' jiġri.
He is coming for us.	Huwa ġej għalina.
I'm glad to be here with you.	Jien kuntent li nkun hawn miegħek.
Not really, but it seemed so.	Mhux tassew, imma hekk deher.
I can't say.	Ma nistax ngħid.
I’m glad you’re here.	Jien kuntent li qiegħed hawn.
I shouldn’t be here at all.	Jien m'għandix inkun hawn xejn.
He had what he needed.	Kellu dak li kellu bżonn.
It takes a lot of time.	Huwa jieħu ħafna ħin.
Someone was leaving.	Xi ħadd kien jitlaq.
Definitely works.	Żgur jaħdem.
I really had a problem with that.	Verament kelli problema b'dan.
After about a few hours.	Wara madwar ftit sigħat.
She would be there.	Hi tkun hemm.
But do nothing.	Imma tagħmel xejn.
Today was not the school.	Illum ma kienx l-iskola.
What he did was wrong.	Dak li għamel kien ħażin.
I don't think he could make much money out of it.	Ma naħsibx li jista’ jkun qed jagħmel ħafna flus milli jagħmel hekk.
Not at all.	Mhux hekk xejn.
We don't need your help.	M'għandniex bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
I don't know how to tell you what happened.	Ma nafx kif ngħidlek x’ġara.
He may have done so.	Jista' jkun li għamel dan.
Has this happened before?	Dan ġara qabel?
Anyone can do a job.	Kulħadd jista' jagħmel xogħol.
But it seems like someone wants to know.	Imma jidher li xi ħadd irid jaħseb li jista’ jkun.
It's good.	Huwa tajjeb.
Or rather, until recently.	Jew aħjar, sa ftit ilu.
And you can tell me what happened.	U tista’ tgħidli x’ġara.
Nothing will happen.	Xejn mhu se jiġri.
No one knew he was there.	Ħadd ma kien jaf li kien hemm.
That is all we can do.	Dan huwa dak kollu li nistgħu nagħmlu.
The first year we did that.	L-ewwel sena għamilna hekk.
Sometimes he did.	Xi drabi hekk għamel.
He never had a single problem.	Qatt ma kellu problema waħda.
So we do.	Hekk nagħmlu.
To be exact, more like anyone else.	Biex inkun eżatt, aktar bħal xi ħadd ieħor.
Like this?	Bħal dan?
It may be the only one.	Jista’ jkun l-uniku wieħed.
I don’t think anyone did.	Ma naħsibx li ħadd ma għamel.
This may take a while.	Dan jista' jieħu ftit.
Something else was there.	Xi ħaġa oħra kienet hemmhekk.
It takes a person.	Huwa jieħu persuna.
It may be the same way you have.	Jista 'jkun l-istess mod li għandek.
And now here.	U issa hawn.
I didn’t want to be here.	Ma ridtx inkun hawn.
You did well.	Int għamilt tajjeb.
I just need a little.	Għandi bżonn ftit biss.
No one wants that !.	Ħadd ma jrid hekk!.
It is.	Huwa.
No one knew.	Ħadd ma kien jaf.
But it had started now.	Imma kien beda issa.
You are very different.	Inti ħafna mod ieħor.
He can if he wants to.	Jista’ jekk irid.
There was crap, too.	Kien hemm ħażin, ukoll.
I'm not talking.	Jien mhux biex nitkellem.
I didn’t have a single friend.	Ma kellix ħabib wieħed.
But not only that.	Imma mhux biss hekk.
This is obviously a must.	Dan huwa ovvjament għandu.
It probably did a lot more than that.	Probabbilment għamlet ħafna aktar barra minn hekk.
I’m sure she knows who she is.	Jien ċert li hi taf min hi.
This I do very well.	Dan nagħmel tajjeb ħafna.
Often, this is great.	Ħafna drabi, dan huwa kbir.
Maybe he knew.	Forsi kien jaf.
And he said a lot more about it.	U qal ħafna aktar dwarha.
Everyone who was someone was there.	Kulħadd li kien xi ħadd kien hemm.
By now, it’s too early.	Sa issa, għadu kmieni wisq.
But that’s not a problem.	Imma dik mhix problema.
I never was.	Jien qatt ma kont.
Everything was as it always was.	Kollox kien kif dejjem kien.
Just never quite enough.	Biss qatt ma pjuttost biżżejjed.
You see what you want to see.	Inti tara dak li trid tara.
And we don't.	U m’għandniex.
I can say so much.	Jien nista' ngħid daqshekk.
I never told anyone.	Qatt ma għedt lil ħadd.
He wants to do things.	Irid jagħmel l-affarijiet.
I was thinking now.	Kont qed naħseb issa.
He’s a bad boy who is really trying to be good.	Huwa tifel ħażin li verament qed jipprova jkun tajjeb.
What they were doing was not as good as what they were.	Dak li kienu qed jagħmlu ma kienx tajjeb daqs dak li kienu.
She knew what he was talking about.	Kienet taf x’kien qed jitkellem dwarha.
What had happened had happened.	Dak li kien ġara kien ġara.
As I saw.	Kif rajt.
Someone else with him.	Xi ħadd ieħor miegħu.
I don’t want that.	Ma rridx dan.
I wanted to, you know that.	Jien ridt, taf li.
But you don’t tell anyone where you are.	Imma int ma tgħid lil ħadd fejn int.
I’m sure there must be a few.	Jien ċert li jrid ikun hemm ftit.
Nothing is really good or really bad.	Xejn mhu tassew tajjeb jew tassew ħażin.
I’m glad to be home.	Jien ferħan li nkun id-dar.
That’s what he does now.	Huwa dak li jagħmel issa.
No, not that.	Le, mhux dik.
He was.	Huwa kien.
I wonder what will happen ?.	Nistaqsi x'se jiġri?.
It would have been a problem.	Kienet tkun problema.
He could not stay here.	Ma setax joqgħod hawn.
He wasn’t sure how he would do it.	Ma kienx ċert kif se jagħmel dan.
You don't usually.	M'għandekx normalment.
That's it.	Dak sar.
We have.	Għandna .
I want to do a lot of things.	Irrid nagħmel ħafna affarijiet.
And we can.	U nistgħu.
You are the last time.	Inti l-aħħar darba.
I couldn't believe it and I didn't know what to say.	Ma stajtx nemmen u ma kontx naf x’se ngħid.
We always knew each other.	Dejjem konna nafu lil xulxin.
Not even here.	Lanqas hawn.
I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for him.	Jien ma kontx hawn kieku ma kienx għalih.
It has to be done that way.	Irid isir hekk.
Our house is really good.	Id-dar tagħna hija tassew tajba.
It’s time we did something.	Wasal iż-żmien li għamilna xi ħaġa.
Not the first.	Le l-ewwel.
Thinking about something is good.	Taħseb dwar xi ħaġa hija tajba.
This is unlikely to happen.	Dan mhux probabbli li jiġri.
No, it's for you.	Le, huwa għalik.
No, no, not for me.	Le, le, mhux għalija.
This has always been his problem.	Din dejjem kienet il-problema tiegħu.
And he could.	U seta’.
All the best.	Kulħadd tajjeb.
This is it.	Dan hu.
I have no idea what's outside that door.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'hemm barra dak il-bieb.
Not there.	Mhux hemm.
I wasn't ready.	Ma kontx lest.
It's going well now.	Huwa sejjer tajjeb issa.
I was too good for any one man.	Kont tajjeb wisq għal xi raġel wieħed.
I don’t think about it.	Ma naħsibx dwarha.
He won't even come back.	Hu lanqas biss se jiġi lura.
Everyone knows it can be fast.	Kulħadd jaf li tista’ tkun malajr.
It has to happen on.	Huwa għandu jiġri fuq.
You are a better man.	Inti raġel aħjar.
But most of all, no.	Imma minn kollox, le.
We can do anything.	Nistgħu nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
He had to make sure.	Kellu jagħmel ċert.
There seemed to be nothing he could do.	Deher li ma kien hemm xejn li seta’ jagħmel.
Well, give it a try.	Ukoll, ipprova.
But it was great.	Imma kien kbir.
He died for me.	Huwa miet għalija.
I couldn’t do as she did.	Ma stajtx nagħmel hekk kif għamlet hi.
And that would rather say something.	U dan ikun pjuttost tgħid xi ħaġa.
Not too long.	Mhux twil wisq.
But you’re not really here.	Imma int m'intix verament hawn.
Someone has to say something.	Xi ħadd irid jgħid xi ħaġa.
Maybe it can work.	Forsi jista 'jaħdem.
I'm not sure.	M'inix ċert.
I said that.	għidt dan.
I never thought he would leave.	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jitlaq.
The time is now.	Il-ħin huwa issa.
I thought we were.	Ħsibt li konna.
Maybe they are.	Forsi huma.
I have a few.	Għandi ftit.
This is not a person.	Din mhix persuna.
I could believe it.	Jien stajt nemmen jien.
Okay, but the same.	Tajjeb, imma l-istess.
Almost everyone does.	Kważi kulħadd jagħmel.
But everything has to.	Imma kollox għandu.
I went to school here.	Jien mort l-iskola hawn.
And I was alone.	U kont waħdek.
I have so much fun.	Jien nieħu gost hekk.
All the time.	Il-ħin kollu.
Whenever he looked back, he saw nothing.	Kull meta ħares lura, ma ra xejn.
I needed this today.	Jien kelli bżonn dan illum.
I had never been there before.	Qatt ma kont hemm qabel.
This works well.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb.
She was so beautiful.	Hija kienet daqshekk sabiħa.
He didn't even die.	Lanqas miet.
Everything they do.	Dak kollu li jagħmlu.
I’m glad he said.	Jien kuntent li qal.
She is very beautiful.	Hija sabiħa ħafna.
She didn’t need to say anything else.	Ma kellha bżonn tgħid xi ħaġa oħra.
Not the first time this has happened.	Mhux l-ewwel darba li ġara.
This all works well.	Dan kollu jaħdem tajjeb.
I knew how to do it.	Kont naf kif nagħmel dan.
I made money.	Għamilt flus.
If anyone can do it.	Jekk xi ħadd jista 'jagħmel dan.
In fact, we know only a little about it.	Fil-fatt, nafu biss ftit dwarha.
But it seems likely.	Imma jidher probabbli.
In fact, it wasn’t.	Fil-fatt, ma kienx.
I don't think anyone can.	Jien naħseb li ħadd ma jista’.
He knows a lot of things.	Jaf ħafna affarijiet.
Ready on that went well.	Lest fuq li mar tajjeb.
He is not here.	Hu mhux hawn.
I need one.	Għandi bżonn wieħed.
I used to go there but not often.	Kont immur hemm imma mhux spiss.
But there is.	Imma hemm.
Only, nothing happens.	Biss, xejn ma jiġri.
Everything seemed to work.	Kollox deher li jaħdem.
I can’t do this alone.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi.
He never wants it that way.	Hu qatt ma jrid hekk.
She had not yet been home.	Kienet għadha ma kinitx id-dar.
It always will be.	Dejjem se jkun.
It was her.	Kienet hi.
He knows that already.	Huwa jaf li diġà.
It’s something we do or do not do.	Hija xi ħaġa li nagħmlu jew nagħmlu.
She was talking to someone.	Kienet titkellem ma’ xi ħadd.
It does nothing else.	Ma jagħmel xejn mod ieħor.
I’m sure you know what that is.	Jien ċert li taf x'inhu dak.
I have time to think about it.	Għandi ħin biex naħseb dwarha.
I spent a lot of time talking to him last night.	Għamilt ħafna ħin nitkellem miegħu lbieraħ filgħaxija.
We did very little.	Ftit li xejn għamilna.
I have to do more than that.	Għandi nagħmel aktar minn dawn.
And you're on.	U int fuq.
So scared.	Hekk jibża.
My first husband died.	Miet l-ewwel raġel tiegħi.
But he wasn’t going to say so.	Imma ma kienx se jgħid hekk.
I will always be yours.	Jien se nkun dejjem tiegħek.
Definitely did.	Żgur li għamel.
I hear you well.	Nisma inti tajjeb.
He had started.	Huwa kien beda.
It was good.	Kien tajjeb.
I couldn’t wait to try one.	Ma stajtx nistenna biex nipprova waħda.
He really played.	Huwa verament kellu.
I think he can do that.	Naħseb li jista’ jagħmel dan.
In fact they are.	Fil-fatt huma.
I was busy.	Jien kont okkupat.
We both needed it.	It-tnejn kellna bżonn.
No one else did much to help.	Ħadd ieħor ma għamel ħafna biex jgħin.
The house was still.	Id-dar kienet għadha.
I'm coming here.	Jien ġej hawn.
Now may be the time.	Issa jista 'jkun il-ħin.
It's great.	Huwa kbir.
They will do well.	Huma ser jagħmlu tajjeb.
He has a chance to survive.	Għandu ċans li jgħix.
Apparently not.	Jidher li le.
It all started here.	Kollox beda hawn.
I think about that tomorrow.	Naħseb dwar dak għada.
I know he wasn’t going to.	Naf li ma kienx se.
It wasn’t hard.	Ma kienx diffiċli.
He didn’t want to think he was the last man he was in.	Ma riedx jaħseb li jkun l-aħħar raġel li kien qiegħed.
You do whatever it takes.	Inti tagħmel dak kollu li hemm bżonn.
And what they were doing.	U dak li kienu jagħmlu.
It wasn’t what it was about.	Ma kienx dak li kien dwar.
I will not be there.	Jien mhux se nkun hemm.
I don't need to know anything else.	M'għandix għalfejn inkun naf xi ħaġa oħra.
I still don't know why.	Għadni ma nafx għalfejn.
And that was all.	U dak kollu kien.
How long ago it appeared.	Kemm ilu deher.
I never tell anyone.	Qatt ma ngħid lil ħadd.
I could say it wasn’t.	Jien stajt ngħid li ma kinitx.
I'm not too sure about that and.	M'inix wisq ċert dwar dan u.
You are here.	Int hawn.
You need someone.	Għandek bżonn xi ħadd.
She was very nice about it.	Kienet sabiħa ħafna dwarha.
And you will be more.	U int tkun aktar.
If you want to know.	Jekk trid tkun taf.
It's still there.	Għadu hemm.
It was nothing like that.	Ma kien xejn bħal dan.
I didn’t want to go.	Ma ridtx immur.
I should have known that.	I kellha naf li kieku.
Nobody could do anything.	Ħadd ma seta’ jagħmel xejn.
That’s something we know best.	Dik hija xi ħaġa li nafu aħjar.
Well, like, about the same time.	Ukoll, bħal, madwar l-istess ħin.
He knew he usually didn’t have to try much.	Kien jaf li normalment ma kellux għalfejn jipprova ħafna.
This was not easy.	Dan ma kienx faċli.
And it won't be.	U mhux se jkun.
You’ll get a lot more out of this book if you do.	Int ser tieħu ħafna aktar minn dan il-ktieb jekk tagħmel hekk.
It should be just.	Għandu jkun biss.
I actually did.	Fil-fatt għamilt.
I enjoy things too much.	Jien nieħu gost wisq l-affarijiet.
This could not happen.	Dan ma setax jiġri.
And there is another person in the room.	U hemm persuna oħra fil-kamra.
I want to.	Irrid.
He had had enough.	Huwa kellu biżżejjed.
I know what he wants.	Naf xi jrid.
Now he was no longer a child.	Issa ma kienx aktar tifel.
You're better than me.	Int aħjar minni.
It was so much, maybe too much.	Kien tant, forsi wisq.
And it was him.	U kien hu.
Well a little was easy.	Ukoll xi ftit kien faċli.
It's hard to say.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid.
He had no idea that anything was wrong.	Ma kellu l-ebda idea li xejn kien ħażin.
It can't be him.	Ma jistax ikun hu.
Not after all this time.	Mhux wara dan iż-żmien kollu.
It’s good, but not that good.	Huwa tajjeb, imma mhux dan tajjeb.
Well, not easy.	Ukoll, mhux faċli.
Can anyone help please ?.	Jista' xi ħadd jgħin jekk jogħġbok?.
I just know he’s pretty out.	Naf biss li huwa pjuttost barra.
He had to come.	Kellu ġej.
And now.	U issa.
I don't have time to do that now.	M'għandix ħin biex nagħmel dan issa.
I’m so bad right now.	Jien daqshekk ħażin bħalissa.
But it was better than that.	Imma kien aħjar minn hekk.
don't time out.	ma ħin barra.
He may be right.	Jista’ jkun li jkollu raġun.
That's it.	Dak hu.
Or, it should be.	Jew, għandu jkun hekk.
I'm glad you're here today.	Jien kuntent li int hawn illum.
We were doing something for each other.	Konna nagħmlu xi ħaġa għal xulxin.
I thought a lot about it.	Ħsibt ħafna dwarha.
Probably not a good idea.	Probabbilment mhux idea tajba.
And that would be him.	U dak ikun hu.
There was nothing else he could do.	Ma kien hemm xejn ieħor li seta’ jagħmel.
I was very good.	Kont tajjeb ħafna.
I said it wasn’t bad.	Jien għidt li ma kienx ħażin.
Each does.	Kull wieħed jagħmel.
He doesn’t want money.	Hu ma jridx flus.
They are the same person.	Huma l-istess persuna.
One just has to know how to do it properly.	Wieħed irid biss ikun jaf kif jagħmel dan kif suppost.
There will be more.	Se jkun hemm aktar.
They do things.	Huma jagħmlu l-affarijiet.
This is probably what you want.	Dan huwa probabbilment dak li trid.
But not really.	Imma mhux fil-fatt.
I’m talking about it here.	Nitkellem dwarha hawn.
No one knew much about it.	Ħadd ma kien jaf ħafna dwarha.
I was.	Jien kont.
Come with me.	Ejja miegħi.
Most of me not even with me now.	Ħafna minni lanqas miegħi issa.
Not sure exactly what you're doing?	Mhux ċert eżatt x'qed tagħmel?
He was here last night.	Kien hawn ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
It was the last thing he had said to his friend.	Kienet l-aħħar ħaġa li kien qal lil ħabib tiegħu.
I didn’t see anything.	Jien ma rajt xejn.
Did you want to stay?	Ridt li jibqa?
Where we were when.	Fejn konna meta.
I thought and thought about it.	Ħsibt u ħsibt dwarha.
And a little.	U ftit.
He was going to have a son.	Kien se jkollu tifel.
No one will think you’re good enough.	Ħadd mhu se jaħseb li int tajjeb biżżejjed.
There may be help.	Jista' jkun hemm għajnuna.
Everything is fine now.	Kollox issa tajjeb.
My first in three years.	L-ewwel tiegħi fi tliet snin.
He wanted to go home.	Ried imur id-dar.
That can never be enough.	Dan qatt ma jista’ jkun biżżejjed.
I'm tired.	Jiena għajjien.
But before you go, let me tell you something.	Imma qabel ma tmur, ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
He is there.	Hu qiegħed hemm.
But stay tonight.	Imma toqgħod illejla.
I’m pretty sure it’s not supposed to.	Jien pjuttost ċert li mhux suppost.
Or you can.	Jew tista '.
And it wasn’t the first.	U ma kienx l-ewwel.
And on and on and on, and on.	U fuq u fuq u fuq, u fuq.
He will be really good.	Hu se jkun tassew tajjeb.
As it was.	Kif kien.
I didn’t have to.	Ma kellix.
You have a lot.	Għandek ħafna.
Everyone was watching.	Kulħadd kien jara.
It's pretty hard, isn't it?	Huwa pjuttost diffiċli, hux?
Whatever she did.	Tkun xi tkun għamlet hi.
We have no friends here.	M'għandniex ħbieb hawn.
You said so.	Inti għidt hekk.
Well, now you know.	Ukoll, issa taf.
It’s both or neither.	Huwa t-tnejn jew l-ebda waħda.
Time has done so.	Il-ħin għamel hekk.
I was understanding better.	Kont qed nifhem aħjar.
All you need to do is go there.	Kull ma trid tagħmel hu li tmur hemm.
Time has passed.	Il-ħin għadda.
You were you.	Int kont int.
This did not look good.	Dan ma deherx tajjeb.
It's bad for you.	Huwa ħażin għalik.
I’m pretty sure it was you.	Jien pjuttost ċert li kont int.
Well, you're too late.	Ukoll, int tard wisq.
You want to do that, well with me.	Trid tagħmel dan hekk, tajjeb miegħi.
I'm so happy.	Jien tant kuntent.
Not as bad as you think.	Mhux ħażin kif taħseb.
It was, as always, back to me.	Ġie, bħal dejjem, lura għandi.
If you're happy, say so.	Jekk int kuntent, għid hekk.
They are like that.	Huma bħal dik.
I have to.	Ikolli.
It may take some time.	Jista 'jieħu ftit ħin.
We were there.	Konna hemm.
I was up there, boy.	Jien kont hemm fuq, tifel.
It's good fun.	Huwa gost tajjeb.
Anyone have an idea.	Kull min għandu xi idea.
He had other problems.	Kellu problemi oħra.
But there was nothing there.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn hemmhekk.
Worried about something.	Inkwetat dwar xi ħaġa.
There are many.	Hemm ħafna.
Whatever you do.	Tkun xi tkun tagħmel.
Good for me.	Tajjeb għalija.
You must come here.	Trid tiġi hawn.
You know how good it was.	Taf kemm kien tajjeb.
I don't want any more.	Ma rridx aktar.
She needed the job.	Hija kellha bżonn ix-xogħol.
It was just a little.	Kien ftit biss.
He wasn’t tired, either.	Hu ma kienx għajjien, lanqas.
I had nothing to say.	Ma kelli xejn xi ngħid.
But not too bad.	Imma mhux ħażin wisq.
I was there at the time.	Jien kont hemm dak iż-żmien.
I have to do something.	Ikolli nagħmel xi ħaġa.
The same.	L-istess.
But he had no idea why this was so.	Imma ma kellu l-ebda idea ta 'għaliex dan kien hekk.
I didn’t know.	Ma kontx naf.
Today, there is nothing.	Illum, m'hemm xejn.
It wasn’t always easy.	Mhux dejjem kien faċli.
Whatever he did, he had to be quick.	Hu x’kien se jagħmel, kellu jkun malajr.
He didn’t know this was going to be something he needed to do.	Ma kienx jaf li din kienet se tkun xi ħaġa li kellu bżonn jagħmel.
It's the same here.	Huwa l-istess hawn.
With a man.	Ma’ raġel.
He makes enough money.	Huwa jagħmel biżżejjed flus.
And it's wrong.	U huwa ħażin.
It was a good thing.	Kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
I can’t tell you that, of course.	Ma nistax ngħidlek hekk, ovvjament.
But he could speak.	Imma seta’ jitkellem.
It was beautiful to do.	Kienet sabiħa li tagħmel.
It was too small.	Kien żgħir wisq.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Ma nistgħu nagħmlu xejn.
The problem is, someone did.	Il-problema hija, xi ħadd għamel.
I still have a lot to say.	Għadni ħafna xi ngħid.
Tomorrow, sure, tomorrow.	Għada, żgur, għada.
But it is something, perhaps.	Imma hija xi ħaġa, forsi.
But it won’t always be.	Imma mhux dejjem se jkun.
What was that? 	Dak x'kien?
She almost had to.	Kważi kellha.
I shouldn’t have eaten so much last night.	Ma kellix niekol daqshekk ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
For one thing, it’s a lot of work.	Għal ħaġa waħda, huwa ħafna xogħol.
That’s a great thing.	Dik hija ħaġa kbira.
He comes back when he comes back.	Jiġi lura meta jiġi lura.
You don’t want any of this to happen.	Inti ma tridx li jiġri xejn minn dan.
Who knew he had one.	Min kien jaf li kellu wieħed.
I was going to talk to you about it.	Kont se nitkellem miegħek dwarha.
It is very difficult.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna.
And she definitely knew where she was.	U hi żgur kienet taf fejn kienet.
She had to say what she knew.	Kellha tgħid dak li kienet taf.
A lot has happened.	Ġara ħafna.
She doesn't even say she doesn't.	Hija lanqas biss tgħid li hi ma.
You want to know this.	Trid tkun taf dan.
What is happening is happening.	Dak li qed jiġri qed jiġri.
She needed to go home.	Hija kellha bżonn tmur id-dar.
You were the first to know.	Int kont tkun l-ewwel li taf.
I'm very happy.	Jien kuntent ħafna.
It never was, it never was.	Qatt ma kien, qatt ma kien.
I wasn’t worried.	Ma kellix inkwetat.
Really, it is.	Tassew, huwa.
And now he does.	U issa jagħmel hekk.
What works on one does not always work on another.	Dak li jaħdem fuq wieħed mhux dejjem jaħdem fuq ieħor.
He was also completely still.	Huwa kien ukoll għal kollox għadu.
Do and say the things you are thinking.	Jagħmel u jgħid l-affarijiet li qed taħseb.
What he says is so.	Dak li jgħid hu hekk.
He lives alone.	Jgħix waħdu.
I know she was.	Naf li kienet.
So and so.	Hekk u hekk.
But there is no one.	Imma m'hemm ħadd.
Eat well, for sure.	Tiekol tajjeb, żgur.
I will definitely do that again.	Żgur li se nerġa’ nagħmel hekk.
Someone came to the door.	Xi ħadd ġie lejn il-bieb.
I know I was doing work.	Naf li kont qed tagħmel xogħol.
I don’t have to do anything.	M'għandix għalfejn nagħmel xi ħaġa.
She is no better.	Hija mhix aħjar.
Why should they.	Għaliex għandhom.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kinitx.
As you go.	Kif tmur.
That's what it really is.	Huwa dak verament dak.
I say so.	Jien ngħid hekk.
Nobody seems to work.	Ħadd ma jidher li jaħdem.
I needed time to think.	Jien kelli bżonn iż-żmien biex naħseb.
But what happened happened.	Imma dak li ġara ġara.
I know how it works.	Naf kif jaħdem.
It may take a few years.	Jista 'jieħu ftit snin.
I haven’t seen any of this.	Jien ma rajt xejn minn dan.
I really can’t say.	Verament ma nistax ngħid.
Not bad.	Mhuwiex ħażin.
Hi, that was it	Hi, li kienet
I should know.	Għandi naf.
Like, everything.	Bħal, kollox.
This is what happens.	Dan huwa dak li jiġri.
Everyone seemed to know each other.	Kulħadd kien jidher li kien jaf lil xulxin.
It’s still the same now.	Għadu l-istess issa.
If not, well not.	Jekk le, ukoll ma.
That's it.	Hekk hu dan.
Everything seemed so difficult.	Kollox deher daqshekk diffiċli.
Time has passed.	Iż-żmien għadda.
You want to see that.	Trid tara li.
I’m not talking about it to anyone, what I did.	Jien ma nitkellem dwarha lil ħadd, dak li għamilt.
Everything seemed to be fine.	Kollox deher li kien tajjeb.
Nobody knows when.	Ħadd ma jaf meta.
I have another chance.	Għandi ċans ieħor.
You have to be ready.	Trid tkun lest.
I won't wait any longer.	Mhux se nistenna aktar.
What she was saying.	Dak li kienet tgħid.
I tell you this.	Jien ngħidlek dan.
But he did not know.	Imma ma kienx jaf.
If there are people.	Jekk ikun hemm nies.
I did wrong.	Għamilt ħażin.
And something else.	U xi ħaġa oħra.
We knew we had to do something.	Konna nafu li kellna nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
We were.	Aħna konna.
How can I go about this?	Kif nista’ mmur dwar dan.
I wish we could.	Nixtieq li nistgħu.
There is nothing.	M'hemm xejn.
I understand why it happened.	Nifhem għaliex ġara.
I think that’s pretty much enough.	Naħseb li huwa pjuttost biżżejjed.
But nothing more.	Imma xejn aktar.
He said ‘probably not’.	Qal ‘probabbilment le’.
He is who he is.	Huwa min hu.
And he could not see.	U ma setax jara.
I'm afraid there's just that.	Nibża li hemm biss dik.
And it was more than that.	U kien aktar minn hekk.
Now, of course, she doesn’t want it to be anything back then.	Issa, ovvjament, hi ma tridx li kienet xi ħaġa lura dak iż-żmien.
This works.	Dan jaħdem.
Now he was gone too.	Issa kien mar ukoll.
It didn’t have to be that way.	Ma kellux ikun hekk.
You can see that.	Inti tista 'tara li dan.
I was scared.	Kont nibża’.
He is doing his best.	Qed jagħmel minn kollox.
It seemed like it hadn’t been there in a long time.	Deher li ma kienx ilu hemm għal ħafna żmien.
Tell me what you see.	Għid dak li tara.
In my room.	Fil-kamra tiegħi.
This is another great one.	Din hija waħda kbira oħra.
You don’t want to tell me, you don’t have to.	Ma tridx tgħidli, m'għandekx għalfejn.
So it seemed to me.	Hekk deher lili.
And you have to do it.	U trid tagħmel dan.
I'll talk to you soon.	Jien ser nitkellem miegħek dalwaqt.
It was really there.	Kien verament hemm.
He had little money.	Kellu ftit flus.
Have you thought about what you were going to say?	Ħsibt dwar dak li kont se tgħid?
I just wanted to know that it’s okay to do that.	Ridt biss li tkun taf li hu tajjeb li tagħmel dan.
I'm trying.	Qed nipprova.
That’s the last thing he wants.	Dik hija l-aħħar ħaġa li jrid.
And we need another.	U għandna bżonn ieħor.
I don’t need anything else.	M'għandi bżonn xi ħaġa oħra.
It seems.	Jidher.
Or maybe it happened.	Jew forsi ġara.
So it works here.	Hekk jaħdem hawn.
It's just there.	Huwa biss hemm.
No one ever went there.	Qatt ħadd qatt mar hemm.
And there was nothing he could do about it.	U ma kien hemm xejn li seta’ jagħmel dwarha.
And that’s all, you know.	U dak kollox, taf.
I knew how.	Kont naf kif.
I really didn't want to go.	Verament ma ridtx immur.
He was a bad man.	Kien raġel ħażin.
He had gone through enough.	Huwa kien għadda minn biżżejjed.
I never expected this to happen.	Qatt ma kont nistenna li dan jiġri.
I didn’t believe she was still there.	Jien ma kontx nemmen li kienet għadha hemm.
And here.	U hawn.
It's never too late.	Qatt m'hu tard wisq.
I knew there was something.	Kont naf li kien hemm xi ħaġa.
I wasn’t very helpful.	Ma kontx ħafna għajnuna.
You’re probably the same.	Int x'aktarx l-istess.
He just had to think.	Kellu biss jaħseb.
Well, of course, he would.	Ukoll, ovvjament, kieku.
I believe we should have done this.	Nemmen li kellna għamilna dan.
He looked very young.	Huwa deher żgħir ħafna.
I was not surprised.	Ma kontx sorpriż.
But now we know why.	Imma issa nafu għaliex.
That was for sure.	Dak kien ċert.
It’s the same with most people.	Huwa l-istess ma 'ħafna nies.
You can do better than that.	Tista 'tagħmel aħjar minn hekk.
Either you or, come on for that.	Jew int jew, ejja għal dak.
He was not working with anyone.	Ma kien qed jaħdem ma’ ħadd.
But he was right.	Imma kellu raġun.
Now, that was really great.	Issa, dan kien verament kbir.
There is only so much you can do.	Hemm biss tant li tista 'tagħmel.
There is no way to know for sure, there is.	M'hemm l-ebda mod biex tkun taf żgur, hemm.
I know it will happen.	Naf li se jiġri.
He had no problem with that.	Ma kellu l-ebda problema b’dan.
I will go now.	Se mmur issa.
His problem is more difficult.	Il-problema tiegħu hija aktar diffiċli.
He can live with that.	Huwa jista 'jgħix ma' dak.
Just a little.	Ftit biss.
You don't need much.	M'għandekx bżonn ħafna.
It was good to see.	Kien tajjeb li tara.
All this together.	Dan kollu flimkien.
All of which were better than nothing.	Li kollha kienu aħjar minn xejn.
He was my friend.	Kien ħabib tiegħi.
I'll try.	Jien ser nipprova.
I really did.	Jien verament għamilt.
I'm really sorry about that.	Jien tassew jiddispjaċini għal dan.
I heard you say something.	Smajt tgħid xi ħaġa.
And he would go, too.	U kien imur, ukoll.
Apart from.	Barra minn.
More comes from.	Aktar ġej minn.
There is a way to do both.	Hemm mod kif tagħmel it-tnejn.
This is not nearly as much as we once had.	Dan mhux kważi daqs kemm kellna darba.
We're just around there.	Aħna biss madwar hemm.
He should be here very soon.	Huwa għandu jkun hawn malajr ħafna.
He didn't have a car.	Ma kellux karozza.
That's how he knew.	Hekk kien jaf.
You did better.	Inti għamilt aħjar.
He looked tired.	Deher għajjien.
And that's good.	U dan huwa tajjeb.
And maybe more.	U forsi aktar.
If you want to do better, you can.	Jekk trid tagħmel aħjar, tista '.
It can happen faster than you.	Huwa jista 'jiġri aktar malajr milli suppost.
It was late afternoon.	Kien tard wara nofsinhar.
He was pretty sure he would try again.	Kien pjuttost ċert li kien se jerġa' jipprova.
I can't talk about that.	Ma nistax nitkellem dwar dan.
I would so.	Nixtieq hekk.
I need.	Għandi bżonn.
It would actually be pretty easy.	Fil-fatt ikun pjuttost faċli.
She sees me.	Hija tara lili.
We never know what will happen next.	Qatt ma nafu x’se jiġri.
There will be no problems.	Mhux se jkun hemm problemi.
You're such a good boy.	Int tifel daqshekk tajjeb.
I don’t think so, but something is happening.	Ma naħsibx, imma qed jiġri xi ħaġa.
That doesn't seem to be worth the effort.	Dak ma jidhirx li ta’ min imur lura għalih.
Not like it was last night.	Mhux bħal ma kien ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
Now you are alone.	Issa inti waħdek.
I just wanted to be a kid.	Ridt biss inkun tifel.
Everyone has something or someone who is worried about it.	Kulħadd għandu xi ħaġa jew xi ħadd li huwa inkwetat dwarha.
She is.	Hija hi.
He knew for sure.	Huwa kien jaf li żgur.
And it was good.	U kien tajjeb.
And there are many.	U hemm ħafna.
They were things.	Kienu affarijiet.
He was thinking that maybe he needed one.	Kien qed jaħseb li forsi kellu bżonn wieħed.
It only gets better.	Jiġi aħjar biss.
For that, that's good.	Għal dan, li tajjeb.
It had been three years.	Kien ilu hemm tliet snin.
I understand quite that.	Nifhem pjuttost.
I didn't go to school.	Jien ma mort l-iskola.
I could be.	I jista 'jkun.
Every time is the same.	Kull darba huwa l-istess.
He knew what was going on.	Kien jaf x’qed jiġri.
Or a friend.	Jew ħabib.
Quite a few, actually.	Pjuttost ftit, fil-fatt.
He knew this was here, he obviously had to.	Kien jaf li dan kien hawn, ovvjament kellu.
This should work.	Dan għandu jaħdem.
This can be difficult.	Dan jista 'jkun diffiċli.
It's us.	Huwa magħna.
But not you, boy.	Imma mhux int, tifel.
It happened in the evening.	Ġara filgħaxija.
Well, not so small, actually.	Ukoll, mhux daqshekk żgħir, fil-fatt.
He is such a good man.	Huwa daqshekk raġel tajjeb.
I never say never.	Qatt ma ngħid qatt.
You have to go to him.	Trid tmur għandu.
And just, you know.	U biss, taf.
On.	Fuq.
.	.
I don't even know who you are.	Lanqas naf min int.
I would be busy.	Jien inkun okkupat.
He just wasn't eating at home.	Huwa biss ma kienx jiekol id-dar.
I can’t believe she really is mine.	Ma nistax nemmen li hi tassew li tkun tiegħi.
Enough was enough.	Biżżejjed kien biżżejjed.
That would be pretty great.	Dak ikun pjuttost kbir.
The faster you do it, the better.	Aktar ma tagħmel dan malajr, aħjar.
It never came out.	Qatt ma ħareġ.
He will be back here tomorrow.	Huwa jkun lura hawn barra għada.
But you know what's going on.	Imma taf li qed jiġri.
I never went back.	Jien qatt ma mort lura.
Later, after.	Aktar tard, wara.
This happened.	Dan ġara.
He could have said more.	Huwa seta 'qal aktar.
It will come, won't it?	Se tiġi, hux?
Well, there is no help for this.	Ukoll, m'hemm l-ebda għajnuna għal dan.
You have a lot of money.	Għandek ħafna flus.
I love it that way.	Jien inħobb hekk.
You know where you are, of course.	Int taf fejn int, ovvjament.
Money, money, money!	Flus, flus, flus!
We had a good one.	Kellna waħda tajba.
I can’t say it has.	Ma nistax ngħid li għandu.
I had the same one, over and over.	Kelli l-istess waħda, aktar u aktar.
No one will be tired.	Ħadd mhu se jkun għajjien.
Now he was scared.	Issa kien jibża.
That was before.	Dak kien qabel.
Who ever wants after what he did.	Min qatt irid wara dak li għamel.
It is not going to work.	Mhux sejjer jaħdem.
I’m not sure why it is so.	M'inix ċert għaliex hu hekk.
I couldn’t even do it.	Lanqas ma stajt nagħmel.
There was no one else there.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor hemmhekk.
And not just me.	U mhux jien biss.
It’s a good thing you’ve been.	Hija ħaġa tajba li ġejt.
It doesn’t taste bad.	Ma jafx ħażin.
He knew it was time to move on.	Kien jaf li kien wasal iż-żmien li jmur.
It could have been me.	Seta’ kont jien.
This must be done as well.	Dan irid isir ukoll.
Always so little.	Dejjem daqshekk ftit.
But there is nothing we can do.	Imma m'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx.
This never happens, of course.	Dan qatt ma jiġri, ovvjament.
Here’s what you never see.	Hawn dak li qatt ma tara.
It’s not really like that, of course.	Huwa mhux verament bħal dik, ovvjament.
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi le.
The truth is they never do.	Il-verità hija li qatt ma jagħmlu.
I wish it was harder.	Nixtieq li kien aktar diffiċli.
But there is more.	Imma hemm aktar.
Many were.	Ħafna kienu.
This was not going to work.	Dan ma kienx se jaħdem.
I needed to know who did it.	Kelli bżonn inkun naf min għamel dan.
And he knows where.	U hu jaf fejn.
I'm not ready.	Jien mhux lest.
She knew nothing.	Ma kienet taf xejn.
It is still.	Huwa għadu.
He did not expect that.	Ma kienx jistenna li.
Everyone thought it was great.	Kulħadd ħaseb li kien tajjeb ħafna.
All this.	Dan kollu.
One, of course, was time.	Wieħed, ovvjament, kien iż-żmien.
My car is good.	Il-karozza tiegħi hija tajba.
And you.	U inti.
And not now.	U mhux issa.
But don’t even talk about it.	Imma lanqas biss titkellem dwarha.
It wasn't a chance.	Ma kienx ċans.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
She knew that now.	Hija kienet taf li issa.
Not so bad.	Mhuwiex daqshekk ħażin.
You don't need to do anything else.	M'għandekx bżonn tagħmel xejn aktar.
This is nothing.	Dan mhu xejn.
It was just too good.	Għadu kemm kien tajjeb wisq.
But we did so three years ago.	Imma hekk għamilna tliet snin ilu.
But you know it.	Imma taf dan.
I’ll do something for you if you want.	Jien nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik jekk trid.
But he couldn't.	Imma ma setax.
Maybe now he can only.	Forsi issa jista 'biss.
He still felt bad.	Għadu ħassu ħażin.
It was hard.	Kien diffiċli.
But it wasn’t the same as that.	Imma ma kienx l-istess bħal dik.
What are you doing?	X'qed tagħmel?
I thought it was pretty good.	Ħsibt li kien pjuttost tajjeb.
Maybe it doesn’t have to be money.	Forsi m'għandux għalfejn ikun flus.
I hope this helps !.	Nittama li dan jgħin!.
This is just our time.	Dan huwa biss iż-żmien tagħna.
That was hard.	Dak kien diffiċli.
But it was too late.	Imma kien tard wisq.
You weren’t ready for that.	Inti ma kontx lest għal dan.
This was very difficult for me.	Dan kien diffiċli ħafna għalija.
But here goes.	Imma hawn imur.
She is not that.	Hija mhix dik.
We have to do it now.	Irridu nagħmlu dan issa.
Also, it was too late.	Barra minn hekk, kien tard wisq.
I need money.	Għandi bżonn flus.
You will make friends.	Inti se tagħmel ħbieb.
Well, it’s that time again.	Ukoll, huwa dak iż-żmien mill-ġdid.
I don’t think it would be that hard.	Ma naħsibx li jkun daqshekk diffiċli.
It should not be here.	M'għandux ikun hawn.
He really wanted this job.	Huwa ried ħafna dan ix-xogħol.
He never had one.	Qatt ma kellu wieħed.
I don’t have time for everyone.	M'għandix ħin għal kulħadd.
But maybe you’re right.	Imma forsi għandek raġun.
Do you still see mine ?.	Għadek tara tiegħi?.
He was really worried.	Kien tassew inkwetat.
We have each other.	Għandna lil xulxin.
And it would not be easy.	U ma jkunx faċli.
Now one thing.	Issa ħaġa waħda.
It was there.	Kien hemm.
I’m not sure how to do that.	M'inix ċert kif nagħmel dan.
I’m sure you’ve heard.	Jien ċert li smajt.
But it was really from.	Imma kien verament minn.
Are you watching 	Qed tara?
he said.	hu qal.
Say what you want to say.	Tgħid dak li trid tgħid.
He died for us.	Miet għalina.
That probably was.	Li probabbilment kien.
But there was nothing you could do about it.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn li tista’ tagħmel.
Good idea.	Idea tajba.
And it was.	U kien .
This is as one would expect.	Dan huwa kif wieħed jistenna.
Very good.	Tajjeb ħafna.
And another thing.	U ħaġa oħra.
You will all be better.	Inti tkun kollha aħjar.
That you are not a good person.	Li m'intix persuna tajba.
That will have to wait.	Li se jkollu jistenna.
I can tell.	Nista' ngħid.
You are so tired.	Inti tant għajjien.
She probably knew that too.	Probabbilment kienet taf ukoll.
He was interested.	Kien interessat.
For all that was before.	Għal dak kollu li kien qabel.
Now we knew why.	Issa konna nafu għaliex.
It has never been so easy.	Hija qatt ma kienet faċli ħafna.
I think that’s a good thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba.
No one can do anything.	Ħadd ma jista’ jagħmel kollox.
Obviously you shouldn't.	Ovvjament m'għandekx.
Why not, he said.	Għaliex le, huwa qal.
Last time.	L-aħħar darba.
It happens more than you want to know.	Jiġri aktar milli trid tkun taf.
He said he would.	Qal li kieku.
That was good.	Dak kien tajjeb.
He wants to go home.	Irid imur id-dar.
And come and find out.	U ġej u taf.
The two are always together.	It-tnejn huma dejjem flimkien.
It was not so.	Ma kinitx hekk.
And you think.	U taħseb.
I don’t want to.	Jien ma rridx.
I’m not so sure.	M'inix daqshekk ċert.
This is now.	Dan huwa issa.
Good job with that.	Xogħol tajjeb ma 'dak.
My beautiful house.	Id-dar sabiħa tiegħi.
She was beautiful, he thought.	Kienet sabiħa, ħaseb.
Who is first?	Min hu l-ewwel?
You are still young.	Għadek żgħir.
Not fast enough.	Mhux malajr biżżejjed.
He arrived after everyone had left.	Huwa wasal wara li kulħadd kien telaq.
It was and is there all the time.	Kien u hemm il-ħin kollu.
I saw a little more.	Rajt ftit aktar.
But that’s just on the outside.	Imma dak huwa biss fuq barra.
But this I did not do mine.	Imma dan mhux għamilt tiegħi.
So did everyone.	Hekk kellu kulħadd.
It started well.	Beda tajjeb.
I knew how much you want something like that.	Kont naf kemm trid xi ħaġa bħal dik.
Or what happened next.	Jew x’ġara wara.
There was no going back.	Ma kienx hemm tmur lura.
I’m not going to settle for that.	Jien mhux se noqgħod għal dan.
No one was home.	Ħadd ma kien id-dar.
I don’t want to do this every time.	Ma rridx nagħmel dan kull darba.
This can be a problem.	Din tista' tkun problema.
Let me wait outside.	Ħa nistenna barra.
This didn’t even happen.	Dan lanqas ma ġara.
But not forever.	Imma mhux għal dejjem.
He had done this before, of course.	Huwa kien għamel dan qabel, ovvjament.
For me, the truth is enough.	Għalija, il-verità hija biżżejjed.
This will help the problem.	Dan se jgħin il-problema.
She wants to go do something else.	Hija trid tmur tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
And it happens whether you like it or not.	U dan jiġri kemm jekk tixtieq jew le.
He was done with that.	Huwa kien lest ma 'dak.
It’s hard to come to terms with.	Huwa diffiċli li wieħed jasal għalih.
I don’t want to go back.	Ma rridx immur lura.
It could be nothing more.	Jista 'jkun xejn aktar.
And so it happened.	U hekk ġara.
Maybe it was nothing.	Forsi ma kien xejn.
There is nothing wrong with it.	M'hemm xejn ħażin miegħu.
That's not your job.	Dak mhux ix-xogħol tiegħek.
He may have had something to eat.	Seta’ kellu xi ħaġa li ried jiekol.
They need a lot of help.	Għandhom bżonn ħafna għajnuna.
Apart from.	Barra minn.
Being outside was hard.	Li tkun barra kien diffiċli.
I don’t want to be his friend.	Ma rridx inkun ħabib tiegħu.
One has to eat to survive.	Wieħed irid jiekol biex jgħix.
I just wanted to know where she was.	Ridt biss inkun naf fejn kienet.
I need quick help.	Għandi bżonn għajnuna ta' malajr.
I'm not good.	Jien mhux tajjeb.
No, definitely not today.	Le, żgur mhux illum.
In fact, we can go further.	Fil-fatt, nistgħu mmorru aktar.
I hope it will be sooner.	Nispera li jkun qabel.
You will, too.	Inti se, ukoll.
He had said so.	Huwa kien qal hekk.
They really were nothing.	Tassew ma kienu xejn.
You know.	Int tkun taf.
No, it's something else.	Le, hija xi ħaġa oħra.
I can't say.	Ma nistax ngħid.
It never looks the same.	Qatt ma jidher l-istess.
I'm not sure.	M'inix ċert.
I need your help.	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
That was my problem.	Dik kienet il-problema tiegħi.
Someone would come.	Xi ħadd kien jiġi.
Good! 	Tajjeb!
so will we.	hekk se nagħmlu.
And you too.	U int ukoll.
It's probably a good thing.	Probabbilment hija ħaġa tajba.
Along with time going and coming.	Flimkien ma' ħin sejjer u ġej.
It's really great.	Huwa verament kbir.
You know that.	Inti taf dan.
Probably a good thing.	Probabbilment ħaġa tajba.
Everyone has that.	Kulħadd għandu dak.
But not the same.	Imma mhux l-istess.
This was not one.	Dan ma kienx wieħed.
It must be you.	Għandu jkun int.
You never see other people.	Qatt ma tara nies oħra.
I did more.	Għamilt aktar.
It can be really difficult.	Jista 'jkun verament diffiċli.
Did something happen?	Ġara xi ħaġa?
Everyone was outside and around.	Kulħadd kien barra u madwar.
That's one thing.	Dik hija ħaġa waħda.
Nothing more he could do here.	Xejn aktar li seta' jagħmel hawn.
I needed more money.	Jien kelli bżonn aktar flus.
He had just moved in.	Kien għadu kif mar joqgħod.
I really didn't know what to say.	Verament ma kontx naf x’se ngħid.
They are, of course, that.	Huma, ovvjament, li.
It is supposed to be.	Suppost li jkun.
You had to.	Int kellek.
If you need anything.	Jekk għandek bżonn xi ħaġa.
There is no tomorrow here.	M'hemm l-ebda għada hawn.
There was so little to see.	Kien hemm daqshekk ftit x’tara.
There was another person in the room.	Kien hemm persuna oħra fil-kamra.
Well, that was no help.	Ukoll, dik ma kienet l-ebda għajnuna.
I knew it was her.	Kont naf li kienet hi.
Not very good.	Mhux tajjeb ħafna.
Something was happening.	Xi ħaġa kienet qed jiġri.
I go easy for you.	Immur faċli għalik.
No one else was here.	Ma kien hawn ħadd ieħor.
Not many friends.	Mhux ħafna ħbieb.
And you've been doing it wrong for a while.	U inti kont qed tagħmel dan ħażin għal xi żmien.
He didn't know where.	Ma kienx jaf fejn.
It is not at all easy to speak well.	Mhux faċli għal kollox li titkellem tajjeb.
Too much here.	Wisq hawn.
And that’s what you wanted too.	U huwa dak li ridt int ukoll.
You can go fast.	Tista' tmur malajr.
He probably would have.	Probabbilment kien ikollu.
That's what he said.	Dak hu kien qal.
I'm fine.	Jien tajjeb.
Look one after the other.	Ħares wara xulxin.
But there is one thing that everyone wants to know.	Imma hemm ħaġa waħda li kulħadd irid ikun jaf.
Before it was.	Qabel ma kienet.
Not a bad idea at all.	Mhux idea ħażina xejn.
You know you have to.	Taf li għandek.
He is my friend.	Huwa ħabib tiegħi.
This is not about it.	Dan mhux dwar dan.
Not yet.	Għadu mhux qiegħed.
There was something he could do.	Kellu jkun hemm xi ħaġa li seta’ jagħmel.
Let's go.	Ejja mmorru.
She had to eat more.	Kellha tiekol aktar.
So be it.	Hekk ikun.
You know that by now.	Inti taf li sa issa.
I'm going.	Jien se mmur.
He was a completely different man.	Kien raġel ieħor għal kollox.
He said he was interested.	Qal li kien interessat.
You can do that.	Tista 'tagħmel dan.
So we did.	Hekk għamilna.
I'm sorry.	Jiddispjaċini.
Really, really great.	Tassew, tassew kbir.
You are wrong.	Inti ħażin.
They have to do it.	Għandhom jagħmlu dan.
I can't even talk to you.	Lanqas ma nista’ nitkellem miegħek.
Now it looks ready.	Issa tidher lest.
It will never be the same.	Qatt mhu se jkun l-istess.
Just tell the truth.	Ngħid il-verità biss.
Everyone was eating.	Kulħadd kien jiekol.
It is much more than that.	Huwa ħafna aktar minn hekk.
Later, it would become more difficult.	Aktar tard, kien isir aktar diffiċli.
I have thought about it many times.	Ħsibt dwarha ħafna drabi.
But it was so hard for him.	Imma kien tant diffiċli għalih.
He sure wanted you to know.	Huwa żgur li ried li inti taf.
He seems to be waiting for someone.	Jidher li qed jistenna lil xi ħadd.
Probably me too.	Probabbilment jien ukoll.
Nobody knows what will happen.	Ħadd ma jaf x’se jiġri.
But no.	Imma le.
I was there for a while.	Kont hemm xi żmien.
Me and no one else.	Jien u l-ebda ieħor.
He knew it was too easy.	Kien jaf li kien faċli wisq.
I will do something for you.	Nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik.
An easy way to go.	Mod faċli biex tmur.
It was my first one.	Kienet l-ewwel waħda tiegħi.
They are as follows.	Huma kif ġej.
You were right all the time.	Int kont raġun il-ħin kollu.
I have to go back.	Jien għandi mmur lura.
It is a lot.	Hija ħafna.
It should.	Għandu.
Nothing seems to be working.	Jidher li xejn mhu qed jaħdem.
I’m friends with just me.	Jien ħbieb ma' ftit jien.
And as I did.	U kif għamilt.
But it can't be.	Imma ma jistax ikun.
He didn't want to.	Ma riedx.
And maybe for you they are nothing.	U forsi għalik huma xejn.
It's not easy.	Mhix faċli.
Maybe he didn't know what it was.	Forsi ma kienx jaf x’kien.
It should not remain.	M’għandux jibqa’.
There and not there.	Hemm u mhux hemm.
It was about the same time.	Kien madwar l-istess ħin.
It's your time.	Wasal iż-żmien tiegħek.
Now there is one.	Issa hemm wieħed.
But too much is wrong.	Imma wisq huwa ħażin.
You will soon see that someone.	Dalwaqt tara li xi ħadd.
It's really good.	Huwa tassew tajjeb.
But no one did.	Imma ħadd ma għamel.
Everyone had the same chance.	Kulħadd kellu l-istess ċans.
We have that.	Għandna dak.
Or not you now.	Jew mhux int issa.
Never be glad to be.	Qatt qatt tkun ferħan li tkun.
Everything was fine.	Kollox kien tajjeb.
I'll tell you about it.	Jien ngħidlek dwarha.
You know where you want to go.	Taf fejn trid tmur.
How much he does.	Kemm jagħmel.
And it was just, it was really hard.	U kien biss, kien verament diffiċli.
He said we would not do that.	Qal li mhux se nagħmlu hekk.
Time only says.	Il-ħin biss jgħid.
I did it for a lot of people.	Għamilt għal ħafna nies.
You can come.	Tista’ tiġi.
Good job!	Xogħol tajjeb!
But before that, nothing.	Imma qabel dan, xejn.
I made a lot of money.	Għamilt ħafna flus.
We never go.	Aħna qatt ma mmorru.
I had to do well.	Kelli nagħmel tajjeb.
He would not have had to do so.	Ma kienx ikollu għalfejn jagħmel hekk.
No one did anything.	Ħadd ma għamel xejn.
She looks really good.	Hija tidher tassew tajba.
Maybe someone else should.	Forsi xi ħadd ieħor għandu.
Everything looks much better.	Kollox jidher ħafna aħjar.
I can’t be the only person here.	Ma nistax inkun l-unika persuna hawn.
But even that wasn’t enough.	Imma lanqas dan ma kien biżżejjed.
But there is.	Imma hemm.
It's good for you.	Huwa tajjeb għalik.
It will not go fast.	Mhux se jmur malajr.
They belonged to someone else.	Kienu ta’ xi ħadd ieħor.
My job is what happens next.	Ix-xogħol tiegħi huwa dak li jiġri wara.
One thing for sure.	Ħaġa waħda żgur.
This is your doing.	Din hija tagħmel tiegħek.
He didn't look happy.	Ma deherx kuntent.
But it started working soon after.	Imma beda jaħdem ftit wara.
But other times.	Imma drabi oħra.
This was not easy.	Dan ma kienx faċli.
He would do that if he could.	Jagħmel dan kieku jista’.
Not for anyone.	Mhux għal ħadd.
Well, that sounds good.	Ukoll, dan jidher tajjeb.
That’s like something to do.	Dak bħal xi ħaġa li tagħmel.
It's not that hard.	Mhuwiex daqshekk diffiċli.
I have an idea.	Għandi idea.
It's very big.	Huwa kbir ħafna.
This is supposed to be.	Dan suppost ikun.
He was doing so much.	Huwa kien qed jagħmel hekk ħafna.
I'm going to take this.	Jien ser nieħu dan.
If he didn’t want so much.	Kieku ma riedx daqshekk.
He knows who he is.	Jaf min hu.
He was not doing that.	Ma kienx jagħmel dan.
He looked at me.	Huwa ħares lejn lili.
That went wrong.	Dak mar ħażin.
Everyone had the same chance.	Kulħadd kellu l-istess ċans.
And you are the first.	U int l-ewwel.
He was sure.	Kien ċert.
Or for mine.	Jew għal tiegħi.
I was nothing and no one.	Jien ma kont xejn u ħadd.
Now everything is back.	Issa kollox ġie lura.
This works very well.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
I would.	Jien nixtieq.
It happens to some people.	Jiġri lil xi nies.
Much of that.	Ħafna minn dak.
Is there anyone who can, please?	Hemm xi ħadd li jista', jekk jogħġbok?
Not for nothing.	Mhux għal xejn.
It could be better.	Jista 'jkun aħjar.
But this is what he did.	Imma dan hu li għamel.
Once, and only once, he was here.	Darba, u darba biss, kien hawn.
It may not be.	Jista 'ma jkunx.
He knows that, too.	Jaf li, ukoll.
Anyone who wants to will have to give it a try.	Kull min irid se jkollu jipprova tassew.
We’ve been doing this for a while.	Konna qed nagħmlu dan għal xi żmien.
Later they do well.	Aktar tard jagħmlu tajjeb.
When exactly did you arrive?	Meta wasal eżatt?
I didn’t want to tell you.	Ma ridtx ngħidlek.
That's it, last.	Dak hu, l-aħħar.
He's just trying to figure out what to do.	Huwa biss jipprova jaħdem x'għandu jagħmel.
Everyone can see what it is.	Kulħadd jista’ jara x’inhu.
My first.	L-ewwel tiegħi.
There must be a lot.	Għandu jkun hemm ħafna.
Most people.	Ħafna nies.
Definitely not so bad.	Żgur li ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
What you think becomes you.	Dak li taħseb isir int.
I can’t talk about it, ever.	Ma nistax nitkellem dwarha, qatt.
Something to talk about.	Xi ħaġa li titkellem dwarha.
, u.	, u.
But he had gone too far.	Imma kien mar wisq.
Maybe at another time.	Forsi fi żmien ieħor.
How can one be sure of this?	Kif jista’ wieħed ikun ċert minn dan?
That was a few years ago.	Dan kien ftit snin ilu.
It's so good.	Huwa daqshekk tajjeb.
The help is great.	L-għajnuna hija kbira.
I thought it was you.	Ħsibt li kont int.
It still was.	Għadu kien.
Who did this?	Min għamel dan?
That would be a good thing.	Dik tkun ħaġa tajba.
Sorry for that.	Jiddispjaċini għal dan.
I don't understand why.	Jien ma nifhem għaliex.
He came around.	Huwa daħal madwar.
For a while.	Għal ftit.
We can’t even do that now.	Ma nistgħux lanqas b'dan issa.
But he never came.	Imma hu qatt ma ġie.
She did so.	Hija għamlet hekk.
It was just there.	Kien hemm biss.
I said this before.	Dan għidt qabel.
He enjoys talking to other people.	Jieħu gost ħafna jitkellem ma’ nies oħra.
Not for you either.	Lanqas għalik.
He could do a little more now.	Huwa seta 'jagħmel ftit aktar issa.
Still bad.	Għadu ħażin.
Bar, bar, bar.	Barra, barra, barra.
We, you and I.	Aħna, int u jien.
The only thing was that he didn't want to leave.	L-unika ħaġa kienet li ma riedx jitlaq.
There is no easy way, is there?	M'hemm l-ebda mod faċli, hux?
But it will not happen.	Imma mhux se jiġri.
This can be.	Dan jista 'jkun.
Now it never will.	Issa qatt mhu se.
Is this a bad person?	Din hija persuna ħażina?
Who knows why.	Min jaf għaliex.
He was almost there.	Huwa kien kważi hemm.
It can work.	Jista 'jaħdem.
Not a bad job.	Xogħol mhux ħażin.
I will do this in the morning.	Jien se nagħmel dan filgħodu.
It's pretty beautiful.	Hija pjuttost sabiħa.
No one came out.	Ħadd ma ħareġ.
It's great.	Huwa kbir.
But that’s ready now.	Imma dak lest issa.
I don't know where.	Ma nafx fejn.
Well, it was just here.	Ukoll, kien hawn biss.
It turned out really well.	Ħareġ tassew tajjeb.
Everything happened very quickly.	Kollox ġara malajr ħafna.
Not just for me but for you too.	Mhux għalija biss imma għalik ukoll.
Sorry for you.	Jiddispjaċini għalik.
Wrong.	Ħażin.
No one ever knew why it happened.	Ħadd qatt ma kien jaf għaliex ġara.
Not an easy thing to do.	Mhux ħaġa faċli li tagħmel.
It would take a lot longer.	Ikun jieħu ħafna aktar żmien.
That sounds good to me.	Dan jidher tajjeb għalija.
I never knew why.	Qatt ma kont naf għaliex.
I have never seen anything like it.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
What you say.	Dak li tgħid.
I don’t like to talk.	Jien ma nħobbx nitkellem.
He wanted to do it, but he wanted to be sure.	Ried jagħmel dan, imma ried ikun ċert.
But there was nothing.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn.
It never happens.	Qatt ma jiġri.
It was him.	Kienet hu.
Whatever you may think.	Tkun xi tkun tista' taħseb.
Not really, no.	Mhux tassew, le.
Everything this dog wanted, was his.	Kull ħaġa li ried dan il-kelb, kienet tiegħu.
I want to be there so badly.	Irrid inkun hemm daqshekk ħażin.
You don’t have to see anything.	M'għandekx għalfejn tara xejn.
I can’t say how it was.	Ma nistax ngħid kif kien.
If it’s nothing, it’s nothing.	Jekk mhu xejn, mhu xejn.
.	.
The timing just wasn’t right.	Il-ħin biss ma kienx tajjeb.
Not there you are.	Mhux hemmhekk int.
This is not so easy.	Dan mhux daqshekk faċli.
I am very sorry for that.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal dan.
She is so beautiful.	Hija tant sabiħa.
I didn’t want to.	Ma ridtx.
Well he should.	Tajjeb hu għandu.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ma tistax tagħmel xejn.
I'm sure neither is she.	Jien ċert li lanqas hi.
I just have to tell you.	Ikolli biss ngħidlek.
It was not coming.	Ma kienx ġej.
And you know what it looks like.	U taf kif tidher.
That was my last.	Dik kienet l-aħħar tiegħi.
What are you? 	Dak int?
This is something really great.	Din hija xi ħaġa tassew kbira.
And he never knew it.	U qatt ma kien jaf dan.
And maybe there was more.	U forsi kien hemm aktar.
Pretty much everyone.	Pjuttost kulħadd.
I didn’t want to.	Jien ma ridtx.
I'm still young.	Għadni żgħir.
I understand that you are not yet ready to speak.	Nifhem li għadek m'intix lest biex titkellem.
It was never beautiful.	Qatt ma kienet sabiħa.
Or something, really.	Jew xi ħaġa, tassew.
He didn't want to see that.	Ma riedx jara hekk.
We are like that.	Aħna bħal dawn.
You have made our job much easier.	Int għamilt ix-xogħol tagħna ħafna aktar faċli.
There was no need to speak, nor for me.	Ma kienx hemm bżonn li titkellem, u lanqas għalija.
It looks so much better.	Jidher ħafna aħjar.
They do nothing.	Huma ma jagħmlu xejn.
She had known this one for years.	Hija kienet taf dan wieħed għal snin.
Back a year ago.	Lura sena ilu.
He can't do that.	Ma jistax jagħmel hekk.
He does the work for you.	Huwa jagħmel ix-xogħol għalik.
I want to tell you.	Irrid ngħidlek.
It’s just who you are.	Huwa biss min int.
They have always been so, both of them.	Dejjem kienu hekk, it-tnejn li huma.
It was hard to tell how much she had.	Kien diffiċli li tgħid kemm kellha.
Little is good.	Ftit huwa tajjeb.
What you have right now.	Dik li għandek bħalissa.
It took a long time.	Ħa ħafna żmien.
Nothing that will do the same.	Xejn li se jagħmel l-istess.
Well, maybe he did.	Ukoll, forsi hekk għamel.
Everything should be fine now.	Kollox għandu jkun tajjeb issa.
No one knows much about it.	Ħadd ma jaf ħafna dwarha.
It happens to many.	Jiġri lil ħafna.
One had to have help there.	Wieħed kellu jkollu għajnuna hemmhekk.
It was good.	Ġie tajjeb.
She is the one she really loves.	Hija hi li tassew iħobb.
I really don't know.	Verament ma nafx.
We need more money.	Għandna bżonn aktar flus.
I want there to be some way to be sure.	Nixtieq li jkun hemm xi mod biex tkun ċert.
This can be both good and bad.	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb u ħażin.
In fact, this may already be happening.	Fil-fatt, dan jista 'diġà qed jiġri.
It could be anyone.	Jista’ jkun xi ħadd.
Some people do, and some people don’t.	Xi nies jagħmlu, u xi nies le.
It hadn’t been that long.	Ma kienx ilu daqshekk.
Enough time has passed.	Għadda biżżejjed żmien.
When it is not, it is not.	Meta dan ma jkunx, li ma jkunx.
Now, tell the truth.	Issa, għid il-verità.
You will do well.	Inti ser tagħmel tajjeb.
I know one thing.	Naf ħaġa waħda.
A man knew where he was.	Raġel kien jaf fejn kien.
Not here.	Mhux hawn.
He wasn’t sure about it yet.	Għadu ma kienx ċert dwarha.
You went home.	Inti mort id-dar.
You are nothing to me.	Int xejn għalija.
In fact, there was none.	Fil-fatt, ma kien hemm ħadd.
There is no work behind this.	M'hemm l-ebda xogħol wara dan.
You may want to get back from this one early.	Inti tista 'tixtieq li lura minn dan wieħed kmieni.
This is actually what happened.	Dan huwa fil-fatt dak li ġara.
It wasn’t much.	Ma kienx ħafna.
He just wants to work.	Huwa biss irid jaħdem.
I have to say.	Irrid ngħid.
I do this at home.	Nagħmel dan id-dar.
He wasn’t just talking.	Hu ma kienx qed jitkellem biss.
If you have nowhere to go you can stay with us.	Jekk m'għandekx fejn tmur tista' toqgħod magħna.
It doesn't have to be this way.	M'għandux ikun bħal dan.
I have to go first.	Irrid immur l-ewwel.
To do this later was.	Biex tagħmel dan wara kien.
Obviously, there is work as well.	Ovvjament, hemm xogħol ukoll.
We had done it once and that was enough.	Konna għamilna darba u dan kien biżżejjed.
He just thought it was.	Huwa biss ħaseb li kien.
It helps a lot of people.	Jgħin ħafna nies.
I’m worried about that too.	Jien inkwetat dwar dan ukoll.
It may be too late now.	Issa jista’ jkun tard wisq.
And another after that.	U ieħor wara dak.
The work was almost finished.	Ix-xogħol kien kważi lest.
I hope this helps someone later.	Nispera li dan jgħin lil xi ħadd aktar tard.
He never was and never will be.	Hu qatt ma kien u qatt ma kien se jkun.
Who has more, wants everything.	Min għandu aktar, irid kollox.
Not my truth.	Mhux il-verità tiegħi.
I know so much.	Naf daqshekk.
And tomorrow.	U għada.
Either both or neither.	Jew it-tnejn jew l-ebda waħda.
No, not good enough.	Le, mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
I hope it’s okay.	Jien nittama li jkun tajjeb.
More than enough.	Aktar minn biżżejjed.
He didn’t have to.	Huwa ma kellux ikollu.
Try it, see.	Ipprova, tara.
Now, the time is now.	Issa, iż-żmien huwa issa.
Nothing more he could do about it, really.	Xejn aktar li seta' jagħmel dwarha, tassew.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
I think there could be more than that.	Naħseb li jista 'jkun hemm aktar minn hekk.
Sa ????????? 	Sa ?????????
Before it's too late.	Qabel ma jkun tard wisq.
It just does.	Hija biss tagħmel.
They are now.	Huma issa.
And in fact it has been for some time.	U fil-fatt kien għal xi żmien.
It didn’t look bad.	Ma deherx ħażin.
He wants to win.	Irid jirbaħ.
I went alone.	Jien mort waħdi.
I was sitting there trying to think.	Kont bilqiegħda hemm nipprova naħseb.
In fact, he had.	Fil-fatt, kellu.
I was a kid, I couldn't do that.	Jien kont tifel, ma stajtx nagħmel hekk.
But she was.	Imma hi kienet.
That’s just that.	Dak hu biss dak.
And it was good.	U kien tajjeb.
I'm too busy to go.	Jien okkupat wisq biex immur.
I never knew anyone did this until recently.	Qatt ma kont naf li xi ħadd għamel dan sa ftit ilu.
We are not like you.	Aħna mhux kif int.
I know how bad it is right now.	Naf kemm hi ħażina bħalissa.
To be, or not to be.	Li tkun, jew li ma tkunx.
You can be who you are.	Tista’ tkun min tista’ tkun.
You are not right.	M'għandekx raġun.
You do your job.	Inti tagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħek.
He is doing a good job.	Qed jagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
It would only be for.	Ikun biss għal.
I'm not interested in doing that.	M'iniex interessat li nagħmel hekk.
Now, everyone is happy.	Issa, kulħadd huwa kuntent.
There were none of these things.	Ma kien hemm xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet.
Our dog was happy all the time.	Il-kelb tagħna kien kuntent il-ħin kollu.
Everything happened.	Kollox ġara.
It was hard to tell.	Kien diffiċli li tgħid.
Not forever.	Mhux għal dejjem.
It could have been a big job for him.	Seta’ kien xogħol kbir għalih.
He knows too much.	Jaf wisq.
She knew the car.	Kienet taf il-karozza.
I'm tired.	Jien għajjien.
I hope this helps.	Nittama li dan jgħin.
That's just the problem.	Dik hija biss il-problema.
There is work to be done.	Hemm xogħol madwar.
He is happy.	Huwa kuntent.
It was there.	Kien hemm.
I’m here for you too.	Jien hawn għalik ukoll.
And now or never.	U issa jew qatt.
It's so much easier that way.	Huwa ħafna aktar faċli hekk.
There must be something wrong there.	Hemmhekk irid ikun hemm xi ħaġa ħażina.
It was so.	Ġie hekk.
In fact, no one can.	Fil-fatt ħadd ma jista’.
But everything else, too.	Imma kull ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
We can be here.	Nistgħu nkunu hawn.
I’m still trying to understand why she did that.	Għadni qed nipprova nifhem għaliex għamlet hekk.
It doesn’t have to be that way.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
There is no problem with that.	M'hemm l-ebda problema b'dan.
Where it should be.	Fejn kellu jkun.
He should know.	Għandu jkun jaf.
We have to do the same.	Irridu nagħmlu l-istess.
He didn’t know when it was enough.	Ma kienx jaf meta kien biżżejjed biżżejjed.
He didn’t know what to do anymore.	Ma kienx jaf x'għandu jagħmel aktar.
We’ve been there a long time.	Konna hemm żmien twil.
Maybe he couldn’t.	Forsi ma setax.
Well, now we have the first.	Ukoll, issa għandna l-ewwel.
It really doesn't.	Huwa verament ma.
So is she with me.	Hekk hi miegħi.
Everything was going so well.	Kollox kien sejjer daqshekk tajjeb.
Definitely not there before.	Żgur li ma kinitx hemm qabel.
That's when.	Dak hu meta .
It can't be.	Ma jistax ma jkun.
It's still here.	Għadu hawn.
There is no one there.	M'hemm ħadd hemm.
Well, that was then, this now.	Ukoll, dak kien dak iż-żmien, dan issa.
I never thought he would do anything like that.	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I didn’t even know he was still around.	Lanqas kont naf li għadu madwar.
But not too late.	Imma mhux tard wisq.
There is nothing more.	M'hemm xejn aktar.
I just thought maybe you know.	Ħsibt biss li forsi taf.
Now there is a problem.	Issa hemm problema.
I'm ready to wait.	Jien lest nistenna.
It's much better now.	Huwa ħafna aħjar issa.
I love my home.	Inħobb id-dar tiegħi.
But she was more than that.	Imma hi kienet aktar minn hekk.
Anyone can do that.	Kulħadd jista 'jagħmel dan.
He seems to be waiting for something.	Jidher li qed jistenna xi ħaġa.
This can be overwhelming.	Dan jista 'jkun kbir.
Just as he wanted.	Biss kif ried hu.
Nobody goes there.	Ħadd ma jmur hemm.
She knew how it felt.	Kienet taf kif ħassu.
Maybe there is.	Forsi hemm.
Not that it's a bad idea.	Mhux li hija idea ħażina.
She had no idea what to do next.	Hija ma kellha l-ebda idea x'se tagħmel wara.
It had been working so long!	Kien ilu jaħdem tant!
I'm not.	Jien le.
Only, here you are.	Biss, hawn int.
She had a husband with him.	Kellu raġel miegħu.
It was not very helpful.	Ma kinitx ta’ għajnuna kbira.
Something really, really, really bad.	Xi ħaġa tassew, tassew, tassew ħażina.
It was ahead of its time.	Huwa kien qabel iż-żmien tiegħu.
It would be wrong not to.	Ikun ħażin li ma.
Surely we know that now.	Żgur li nafu li issa.
He would not want to live.	Ma jkunx irid jgħix.
It’s time to go.	Wasal iż-żmien li mmorru.
And now you are.	U issa int.
But everything went wrong.	Imma kollox mar ħażin.
This book is just that and it does well.	Dan il-ktieb huwa biss dak u jagħmel tajjeb.
Pretty much what happened to me.	Pjuttost dak li ġara lili.
We did no wrong.	Aħna ma għamilna l-ebda ħażin.
It was really good.	Kien tassew tajjeb.
She knew everything was going to work out.	Kienet taf li kollox kien se jaħdem.
But he has an idea.	Imma għandu idea.
It will be done after that.	Hija ser isir wara dak.
You already have an account.	Diġà għandek kont.
That's what he did.	Dak għamel dan.
He will leave.	Huwa se jitlaq.
And sometimes.	U xi drabi.
But you have to be ready.	Imma trid tkun lest.
But that wasn’t quite what was happening here.	Imma dan ma kienx pjuttost dak li kien qed jiġri hawn.
You have a good son.	Għandek tifel tajjeb.
For me, every child is the same.	Għalija, kull tifel huwa l-istess.
It's still a long time.	Għadha ħafna ħin.
I still believe it was wrong.	Għadni nemmen li kien ħażin.
I'm sorry.	Jiddispjaċini.
Like, a lot.	Bħal, ħafna.
I can’t wait to try that.	Ma nistax nistenna li nipprova dak.
Not coming back.	Mhux ġej lura.
When he felt tired, he sat down.	Meta ħassu għajjien, poġġa bilqiegħda.
He is the only child in the room.	Huwa l-uniku tifel fil-kamra.
There’s more to where that came from, always.	Hemm aktar minn fejn ġie dak, dejjem.
This may be right for you.	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb miegħek.
And things like that.	U affarijiet bħal dawn.
Obviously, here’s something wrong.	Ovvjament, hawn xi ħaġa ħażina.
That wasn't it!	Li ma kienx!
I hope it will.	Nittama li se.
A year ago.	Sena ilu.
He never told the truth.	Hu qatt ma qal il-verità.
You need help.	Għandek bżonn l-għajnuna.
Soon my friend.	Dalwaqt ħabib tiegħi.
But, of course, he had to go.	Imma, ovvjament, kellu jmur.
This is my hand.	Dan huwa imma tiegħi.
For so long.	Għal tant.
But he was a good person.	Imma kien persuna tajba.
Nothing too bad.	Xejn ħażin ħafna.
No time for that now.	L-ebda ħin għal dak issa.
You are doing well.	Int sejjer tajjeb.
This is not so.	Dan mhux hekk.
And it works.	U dan jaħdem.
The problem with this is that of course.	Il-problema b'dan hija li ovvjament.
It happened a long time ago.	Ġara żmien twil ilu.
And we don't.	U aħna ma.
But no one regrets me.	Imma ħadd ma jiddispjaċini għalija.
I have never seen one like that before.	Qatt ma rajt waħda bħal dik qabel.
I said it is very likely to be wrong.	Għidt li huwa probabbli ħafna li huwa ħażin.
It looks like something up.	Jidher qisu xi ħaġa sa.
And they were, for a while.	U kienu, għal xi żmien.
He never had and never will.	Hu qatt ma kellu u qatt mhu se.
Unless you want to.	Sakemm ma tridx.
I just wanted to see.	Ridt biss nara.
His car, no.	Il-karozza tiegħu, le.
He thought it was something.	Huwa ħaseb li kien xi ħaġa.
Here's what it will do.	Hawn dak li se tagħmel.
But maybe that was enough.	Imma forsi kien biżżejjed.
No, she didn't stay here.	Le, ma kinitx toqgħod hawn.
It's a good job.	Huwa xogħol tajjeb.
Or you can make your own.	Jew tista 'tagħmel tiegħek.
Everyone wants everything.	Kulħadd irid dak kollu.
I’m a good man having a hard time.	Jien raġel tajjeb li qed ikolli żmien diffiċli.
Or, really, who.	Jew, tassew, min.
That was my job.	Dak kien ix-xogħol tiegħi.
I wish I was here.	Nixtieq li kont hawn.
And it didn’t do a very good job.	U ma tantx għamlet xogħol tajjeb.
If nothing happens, you’re good to go.	Jekk ma jiġri xejn, int tajjeb li tmur.
Nothing would be better than this.	Xejn ikun aħjar minn dan.
No one had ever done this before.	Ħadd qatt ma kien għamel dan qabel.
Everyone had come out.	Kulħadd kien ħareġ.
You can never tell.	Qatt ma tista’ tgħid.
I hadn’t thought of that.	Ma kontx ħsibt dan.
In fact, you are the first.	Fil-fatt, int l-ewwel.
You're not saying what happened.	Mhux qed tgħid x’ġara.
Never talk without thinking.	Qatt titkellem mingħajr ma taħseb.
And maybe it wasn’t.	U forsi ma kienx.
It’s something to see.	Hija xi ħaġa li tara.
But it couldn’t happen.	Imma ma setax jiġri.
He did not know what to say.	Ma kienx jaf x’se jgħid.
We didn't know what to do.	Ma tantx konna nafu x’qed nagħmlu.
Someone else was in the room.	Xi ħadd ieħor kien fil-kamra.
I don't know who you are.	Ma nafx min int.
We were right.	Kellna raġun.
And this is better than anything else.	U dan huwa aħjar minn kull ħaġa li xi ħadd ieħor jagħmel.
Same with me.	L-istess miegħi.
He started to leave.	Beda jitlaq.
You don’t have to talk to one.	M'għandekx għalfejn titkellem sa wieħed.
If you're late, you're late.	Jekk int tard, int tard.
You're good too.	Int tajjeb ukoll.
He will stay here with me.	Hu se jibqa’ hawn, miegħi.
You can't do a thing.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel ħaġa.
But maybe not as hard as it sounds.	Imma forsi mhux daqshekk diffiċli kif jidher.
This did not look so bad.	Dan ma deherx daqshekk ħażin.
Everyone was scared.	Kulħadd kien jibża.
Everyone wants to leave.	Kulħadd irid jitlaq.
But that will not happen again.	Imma dan mhux se jerġa’ jiġri.
You have to do what you want.	Trid tagħmel dak li trid.
After.	Wara.
Well done.	Tajjeb nagħmlu.
He knew how to do it.	Kien jaf kif jagħmel hekk.
Nobody goes anymore.	Ħadd ma jmur aktar.
It gets better.	Tiġi aħjar.
But it doesn’t.	Imma ma jagħmilx hekk.
And maybe never.	U forsi qatt.
That she can.	Li hi tista '.
Just so good.	Eżatt hekk tajjeb.
He was sure of that.	Kien ċert minn dan.
You don’t have to do anything else.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel xejn aktar.
This she cannot do.	Dan hi ma tistax tagħmel.
I want to be on top of that.	Irrid inkun fuq dan.
There is no right or wrong, really.	M'hemm l-ebda tajjeb jew ħażin, tassew.
He may be hearing from me later !.	Jista' jkun qed nisma' minni aktar tard!.
You are nobody.	M'intix ħadd.
Or I thought I did.	Jew ħsibt li għamilt.
He seemed a little worried about how far this was going.	Huwa deher ftit inkwetat dwar kemm kien sejjer dan.
That would come later, he knew.	Dan kien se jiġi aktar tard, kien jaf.
I just didn’t know.	Jien biss ma kontx naf.
And it wasn't.	U ma kienx.
It wasn’t the first time, and it won’t be the last.	Ma kinitx l-ewwel darba, u mhux se tkun l-aħħar.
If it’s good for us, great.	Jekk hemm tajjeb għalina, kbir.
No one is here.	Ħadd mhu hawn.
It was our first time, but we will be back.	Kienet l-ewwel darba tagħna, imma se nkunu lura.
It’s been here a little over a year.	Ilu hawn ftit aktar minn sena.
I know better.	Naf aħjar.
You know what you want !.	Taf li trid!.
I was so out of here.	Kont tant barra minn hawn.
Lots of work.	Ħafna xogħol.
At the time I wasn’t thinking about anything.	Dak iż-żmien ma kont naħseb xejn.
He didn't have much to say.	Ma kellux ħafna xi jgħid.
It just comes.	Jiġi biss.
Well, it looks bad.	Ukoll, jidher ħażin.
I wanted to, but I didn't really know what it was going to be like.	Ridt, imma ma kontx verament naf kif kien se jkun.
When it was.	Meta kien.
I've seen it happen.	Stajt nara li jiġri.
And it is likely to remain so for some time to come.	U x'aktarx se jibqa' hekk għal xi żmien li ġej.
Not one by one.	Mhux waħda waħda.
As it once was.	Kif kien darba.
He needed a friend.	Huwa kellu bżonn ħabib.
Now, that's not the only idea.	Issa, mhix l-unika idea.
They are.	Huma.
It may or may not come.	Jista 'jew qatt ma jasal.
It’s not supposed to happen here.	Mhux suppost jiġri hawn.
We were outside.	Konna konna barra.
It is very good it can stay there forever.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna jista 'jibqa' hemm għal dejjem.
Maybe he was waiting for someone.	Forsi kien qed jistenna lil xi ħadd.
Not the same thing as being.	Mhux l-istess ħaġa li tkun.
You don’t need to know now.	M'għandekx bżonn tkun taf issa.
It could be both.	Jista’ jkun it-tnejn.
Maybe so.	Forsi hekk.
He never said what he was planning to do.	Qatt ma qal dak li kien qed jippjana li jagħmel.
No one told me so.	Ħadd ma qalli hekk.
But there is something else.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
We don’t have much time.	M'għandniex ħafna ħin.
And some other friends.	U xi ħbieb oħra.
But he knew who she was.	Imma hu kien jaf min kienet.
He lost to a man who had a better year.	Huwa tilef għal raġel li kellu sena aħjar.
I thought a lot about it.	Ħsibt ħafna dwar dan.
Now, very much so.	Issa, ħafna hekk.
Properly.	Kif suppost.
You were a friend.	Int kont ħabib.
I have to be me again.	Għandi nerġa’ nkun jien.
Where? ' 	Fejn?'
I needed someone.	Jien kelli bżonn xi ħadd.
You can be a child.	Tista’ tkun tifel.
It was coming.	Kien ġej.
I don’t have the house.	Jien m'għandix id-dar.
It could be better.	Jista 'jkun aħjar.
There were many.	Kien hemm ħafna.
But it wasn’t going to happen here.	Imma ma kienx se jiġri hawn.
There you have it.	Hemmhekk għandek.
But he can't.	Imma ma jistax.
I knew he was coming, and he did.	Kont naf li kien ġej, u hekk għamel.
How much more ?.	Kemm hemm aktar?.
He wanted this.	Huwa ried dan.
So much.	Tant.
But now he has something he can do.	Imma issa kellu xi ħaġa li seta’ jagħmel.
Well, that's not good enough for me.	Ukoll, dan mhux tajjeb biżżejjed għalija.
We have to go there.	Irridu mmorru hemm.
And so they do.	U hekk jagħmlu.
Now he had gone back.	Issa kien mar lura.
I don't know what to do.	Ma nafx x’se tagħmel.
Each for himself.	Kull wieħed għalih.
Not as you think, he says.	Mhux kif taħseb, jgħid.
Sorry it had to be you.	Jiddispjaċini li kellha tkun int.
And he.	U hu.
That would be.	Dak ikun.
I don’t know how I love a man.	Ma nafx kif inħobb raġel.
But if it’s not for you, that’s fine too.	Imma jekk mhux għalik, dan huwa tajjeb ukoll.
I hope you do too.	Nispera li inti tagħmel ukoll.
You are not so bad.	M'intix daqshekk ħażin.
Never.	Qatt.
It has to be done.	Irid isir.
I don't know what's going on.	Ma nafx x’qed jiġri.
You want to talk to him.	Trid titkellem miegħu.
I hope it helps.	Nispera li jgħin.
Let's do this.	Ejja nagħmlu dan.
But so is he.	Imma hekk hu.
He did it now.	Dan għamel issa.
This may work.	Dan jista 'jaħdem.
But nothing is easy.	Imma xejn ta’ min ikollu jiġi faċli.
It was still too much to be sure.	Kien għadu wisq biex tkun ċert.
Well, you know.	Ukoll, taf.
Everything we needed.	Dak kollu li kellna bżonn.
She was eating with him.	Kienet tiekol miegħu.
I don’t know you, boy.	Ma nafx int, tifel.
Who knew you had so much.	Min kien jaf li kellek tant.
It's really bad.	Huwa tassew ħażin.
That's not it.	Dak mhux dan hu.
I have to go back, he thought.	Ikolli mmur lura, ħaseb.
I’m here and you’re there.	Jien hawn u int hemm.
She didn’t know how bad she was.	Ma kinitx taf kemm kienet ħażina.
He needed it done quickly.	Huwa kellu bżonn biex dan isir malajr.
It had to be that way.	Kellu jkun hekk.
You would be better than my friend here.	Int tkun aħjar minn ħabib tiegħi hawn.
I think something is wrong.	Naħseb xi ħaġa ħażina.
It will never go away.	Qatt mhu sejjer.
Here you go.	Hawn tmur.
We’ve never been here before.	Qatt ma konna hawn qabel.
You are doing what you are supposed to.	Int qed tagħmel dak li suppost.
Much the same.	Ħafna l-istess.
In fact, he may be the only one.	Fil-fatt, jista 'jkun l-uniku wieħed.
But here she is.	Imma hawn hi.
It’s here already, always.	Huwa hawn diġà, dejjem.
I can tell you it was a job.	Nista’ ngħidlek li kien xi xogħol.
Nobody knows what to say.	Ħadd ma jaf x’għandu jgħid.
Maybe no one knew.	Forsi ħadd ma kien jaf.
That was what everyone thought.	Kien dak li ħaseb kulħadd.
It still wasn’t enough.	Għadu ma kienx biżżejjed.
He had to settle for something more.	Kellu joqgħod għal xi ħaġa aktar.
Obviously, it should.	Ovvjament, għandu.
And it is not.	U huwa le.
He is not doing any of that.	Mhu qed jagħmel xejn minn hekk.
You don't have me.	Inti m'għandekx lili.
So much for being on things.	Daqshekk li tkun fuq l-affarijiet.
I’m not sure why you’re not watching this.	M'inix ċert għaliex m'intix qed tara dan.
Not easy, people.	Mhux faċli, nies.
He just seemed interested in talking to me.	Huwa biss deher interessat li jitkellem miegħi.
I didn’t hear anything he said.	Ma smajt xejn li qal.
You are not doing very well today.	M'intix sejjer tajjeb ħafna llum.
That can be a problem.	Dik tista 'tkun problema.
Please do not do this.	Jekk jogħġbok tagħmilx dan.
I need that.	Għandi bżonn dak.
It will not happen.	Mhux se jiġri.
Come here.	Ejja hawn.
I'm not sure how he did it.	M'inix ċert kif għamel hekk.
He wanted something more, he wanted something else.	Ried xi ħaġa aktar, ried xi ħaġa oħra.
I think he just didn’t know what to do.	Naħseb li hu biss ma kienx jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t great either.	Ma kienx ħażin, imma lanqas ma kien kbir.
I was happy to do the same.	Kont kuntent li nagħmel l-istess.
It can be really bad.	Jista 'jkun verament daqshekk ħażin.
You just want something more.	Inti biss trid xi ħaġa aktar.
I’m willing to take the following.	Jien lest nieħu dak li ġej.
Now we will.	Issa aħna se.
He was not ready.	Ma kienx lest.
No, it's not.	Le, mhuwiex.
I have to be good.	Għandi nkun tajjeb.
This took hours and hours.	Dan ħa sigħat u sigħat.
That's just it.	Dan biss.
he asked.	staqsa.
In fact, do that to anyone.	Fil-fatt, tagħmel li ħadd.
You will do.	Inti se tagħmel.
But here's the problem.	Imma hawn il-problema.
And you're better.	U int aħjar.
I’m trying a lot.	Qed nipprova ħafna.
You may not be.	Inti tista 'ma tkunx.
But there was nothing.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn.
I want to be good.	Irrid inkun tajjeb.
It came when they felt that way.	Ġie meta ħassu hekk.
This is a long time ago now.	Dan huwa żmien twil ilu issa.
He wanted to go back home.	Ried imur lura d-dar.
After that it was easier.	Wara dan kien aktar faċli.
It was something really hard to do.	Kienet xi ħaġa tassew diffiċli li tagħmel.
We know what that is.	Nafu x'inhu dak.
That you will do all that is right for you.	Li int ser tagħmel dak kollu li hu tajjeb għalik.
I wanted to do better.	Ridt nagħmel aħjar.
I can’t say why.	Ma nistax ngħid għaliex.
I want to talk to you.	Irrid nitkellem miegħek.
That's where it is.	Dak huwa fejn huwa.
They didn’t even look at each other.	Lanqas biss ħares lejn xulxin.
Maybe we never did.	Forsi qatt ma għamilna.
I can’t believe this.	Ma nistax nemmen dan.
Glad about that, sure.	Kuntent dwar dan, żgur.
You should do this when you can.	Għandek tagħmel dan meta tista '.
Maybe he didn’t really want to know.	Forsi ma tantx ried ikun jaf.
It will take a long time.	Se jieħu żmien twil.
I know what I see.	Naf dak li nara.
Do who he is.	Jagħmlu min hu.
It doesn't have to be that way.	M'għandux ikun hekk.
I never thought so.	Qatt ma kont ħsibt hekk.
He looked around.	Huwa ħares madwar.
It seemed to be just one.	Deher li kien wieħed biss.
Just like anything you want.	Eżatt bħal kull ħaġa li trid.
They are.	Huma huma.
One way or another.	Mod jew ieħor.
Here you are.	Hawn int.
It wasn’t a big deal.	Ma kienx xi ħaġa kbira.
If it's just money you need.	Jekk huwa biss flus li għandek bżonn.
And he’s great too.	U hu kbir ukoll.
I will have to go soon.	Ikolli mmur dalwaqt.
He had wanted to.	Huwa kien ried.
It's just.	Huwa biss.
It is, well, of course.	Huwa, ukoll, ovvjament.
No one else knew.	Ħadd ieħor ma seta’ jaf.
But it’s not working here.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem hawn.
There wasn’t me anymore.	Ma kienx hemm jien aktar.
It couldn’t work.	Ma setax jaħdem.
They really were.	Tassew kienu.
What's wrong, if anything?	X'inhu ħażin, jekk xejn?
It hardly came out.	Ma tantx ħareġ.
I know things.	Naf affarijiet.
It certainly wasn’t.	Huwa żgur li ma kienx.
We only have today.	Għandna biss illum.
And you want what you want.	U trid dak li jrid.
But she doesn’t even speak.	Imma hi lanqas titkellem.
Me, me, everyone here.	Lili, lili, lil kulħadd hawn.
We want to.	Irridu.
He and I go back a lot.	Jien u hu mmorru lura ħafna.
Definitely not one of ours.	Żgur li ma kienx wieħed minn tagħna.
I thought it would be a good idea to tell a friend.	Ħsibt li tgħid lil ħabib tkun idea tajba.
You don’t take anything like that.	Inti ma tieħu xejn bħal dak.
There is no one better than me.	M'hemm l-ebda persuna aħjar minni minni.
She knows she's not the only one.	Hija taf li mhix l-unika waħda.
I didn’t want to make everything harder for you.	Ma ridtx nagħmel dak kollu aktar diffiċli għalik.
I thought so, too.	Ħsibt hekk, ukoll.
You don’t need this.	M'għandekx bżonn dan.
You just now said you did.	Inti biss issa għidt li għamilt.
A really difficult time, actually.	Żmien tassew diffiċli, fil-fatt.
This is done now.	Dan isir issa.
He thought he had been there for some time.	Ħaseb li kien ilu hemm għal xi żmien.
It seemed easy too.	Deher faċli wisq.
I’ve never seen one, you know.	Qatt ma rajt waħda, taf.
This happened pretty quickly.	Dan ġara pjuttost malajr.
There he is.	Hemm hu.
He came.	Huwa daħal.
There is usually seating for everyone.	Normalment ikun hemm bilqiegħda għal kulħadd.
It couldn’t work.	Ma setax jaħdem.
In fact, it can be overwhelming.	Fil-fatt, jista 'jkun kbira.
Now not so.	Issa mhux hekk.
When the time comes, of course.	Meta jasal iż-żmien, ovvjament.
She seemed to know everyone.	Kienet tidher li kienet taf lil kulħadd.
I did a good job as well.	Jien għamilt xogħol tajjeb ukoll.
That was a very long time.	Li kien żmien twil ħafna.
It didn’t look right to me.	Ma deherx tajjeb għalija.
And something happens.	U jiġri xi ħaġa.
I couldn't see it anymore.	Ma stajtx nara aktar.
But it doesn’t.	Imma ma jagħmilx hekk.
Not above.	Mhux hawn fuq.
A few other things are needed.	Hemm bżonn ftit affarijiet oħra.
Well, that wasn’t hard.	Ukoll, dan ma kienx diffiċli.
You have to do both.	Int trid tagħmel it-tnejn.
I think there is one thing.	Naħseb li hemm ħaġa waħda.
Everything else has to go.	Kull ħaġa oħra trid tmur.
And not just here.	U mhux hawn biss.
But of course now it’s pretty hard.	Imma ovvjament issa huwa pjuttost diffiċli.
There is only one problem.	Hemm problema waħda biss.
But it won’t get any better.	Imma mhux se jmur aħjar.
This did a good job.	Dan għamel xogħol tajjeb.
I’m glad you came.	Jien ferħan li ġejt.
Will you come with me?	Tiġi miegħi?
There is another.	Hemm ieħor.
He had been there before.	Huwa kien hemm qabel.
There is nothing to come.	M'hemm xejn li ġej.
Where should we go today?	Fejn għandna mmorru llum?
Help a man out.	Għajnuna raġel barra.
There can be more than that.	Jista 'jkun hemm aktar minn hekk.
He was quite surprised.	Kien pjuttost sorpriż.
I like it that way.	Jien inħobb hekk.
This did not look too good.	Dan ma kienx jidher tajjeb wisq.
I already knew that too.	Diġà kont naf hekk ukoll.
I love everyone at home.	Inħobb lil kulħadd id-dar.
He had done nothing but fear.	Huwa kien għamel xejn minn li jibża.
I have a job for you.	Għandi xogħol għalik.
I can’t think about it now.	Ma nistax naħseb dwar dan issa.
But it is something.	Imma hija xi ħaġa.
He didn’t have time before, but he would now.	Ma kellux ħin qabel, imma kien se issa.
And do it.	U tagħmel dan.
Only a year ago.	Sena biss ilu.
There is only this.	Hemm biss dan.
But we are what we are.	Imma aħna dak li aħna.
I think that was it.	Naħseb li kien dak.
I listen to him.	Nisma’ għalih.
It wasn’t happening much.	Ma kienx qed jiġri ħafna.
Nothing.	Xejn.
It’s not something to be afraid of.	Mhix xi ħaġa li wieħed jibża.
He looked surprised.	Huwa deher sorpriż.
Everyone needs a car today!	Kulħadd għandu bżonn karozza llum!
More than happy actually.	Aktar minn kuntent fil-fatt.
Once.	Darba.
Everything this dog wanted, was his.	Kull ħaġa li ried dan il-kelb, kienet tiegħu.
Now and now and now, what is actually here.	Issa u issa u issa, x'inhu fil-fatt hawn.
It was too late for me.	Kien tard wisq għalija.
Sure.	Żgur.
Not too much.	Mhux wisq.
Kellha.	Kellha.
Bad bad bad bad.	Ħażin ħażin ħażin.
No one had come with him.	Ħadd ma kien daħal miegħu.
Like he didn’t want to say.	Bħal ma riedx jgħid.
I was just me again.	Jien kont biss jiena mill-ġdid.
It did not appear.	Ma deherx.
But there is almost nothing we can do.	Imma m'hemm kważi xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu.
But not now, not so.	Imma mhux issa, mhux hekk.
I like it much better.	Din inħobb ħafna aħjar.
Still not alone.	Għadha mhux biss.
Why aren't you coming?	Għaliex m'intix ġej?
Which is wrong.	Li huwa ħażin.
Everything happened on its own.	Kollox ġara waħdu.
As of now, everything seems to be working.	Minn issa, jidher li kollox qed jaħdem.
One too many.	Wieħed wisq.
He was waiting.	Kien jistenna.
You will want to go.	Se tkun trid tmur.
She's not right.	M’għandux raġun.
Whether we like it or not.	Jekk irridu jew le.
Or some other man.	Jew xi raġel ieħor.
You should do it now, in fact.	Għandek tagħmel dan issa, fil-fatt.
Definitely his.	Żgur li kien tiegħu.
I'm totally sorry.	Jiddispjaċini għal kollox.
This will not help.	Dan mhux se jgħin.
This was really easy too.	Dan kien tassew faċli wisq.
We were only a few years old.	Kellna biss ftit snin.
Everyone loved it.	Kulħadd kien iħobb.
It's not that easy.	Mhuwiex daqshekk faċli.
I was in, he was after me.	I kien fi, hu wara lili.
That would be great.	Dan ikun tajjeb ħafna.
I'm too busy to stay here.	Jien okkupat wisq biex noqgħod hawn.
I’m still waiting for that.	Għadu qed nistenna dak.
It was nothing, really.	Ma kien xejn, tassew.
This was so easy to do.	Dan kien daqshekk faċli biex tagħmel.
But not good.	Imma mhux tajjeb.
Well, nothing, really.	Ukoll, xejn, tassew.
He was unhappy, but said nothing.	Ma kienx kuntent, imma ma qal xejn.
Maybe it never will be.	Forsi qatt ma jkun.
One can do this for quite some time.	Wieħed jista 'jagħmel dan għal żmien pjuttost twil.
I wish we could be friends.	Nixtieq li nistgħu nkunu ħbieb.
Not for me either, really.	Lanqas għalija, tassew.
He could see.	Li seta' jara.
How he died.	Kif miet.
There was another man.	Kien hemm raġel ieħor.
Tell anyone what's really going on.	Tgħid lil ħadd x’inhu verament jiġri.
He does this to everyone.	Jagħmel dan lil kulħadd.
It works for me !.	Jaħdem għalija!.
But there is something else out there.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa oħra hemmhekk.
Hard to say.	Diffiċli li tgħid.
Everyone knows what it looks like.	Kulħadd jaf kif jidher.
Not everyone does that.	Mhux kulħadd jagħmel hekk.
That's what you do.	Dak hu li tagħmel.
It was visible.	Kien jidher.
Now you are a man.	Issa int raġel.
He will be great.	Hu se jkun kbir.
I'm a person.	Jien persuna.
And one man was.	U raġel wieħed kien.
This is a bad thing.	Din hija ħaġa ħażina.
First, there seems to be no problem.	L-ewwel, jidher li m'hemm l-ebda problema.
He was not loved.	Ma kienx iħobb.
I'm still.	Għadni qiegħed.
Bad for him.	Ħażin għalih.
The problem is that they never are.	Il-problema hi li qatt ma huma.
Now he knew what it was.	Issa kien jaf x’kien.
If it were there.	Kieku kien hemm.
Usually a lot more of the former than the latter.	Normalment ħafna aktar ta 'l-ewwel milli ta' l-aħħar.
I’m not really here to try anything.	Jien ma tantx hawn biex nipprova xejn.
I would like to do that again.	Nixtieq nerġa' nagħmel dan.
Here's something wrong.	Hawn xi ħaġa ħażina.
Things are not easy for me now.	L-affarijiet mhux faċli għalija issa.
It shouldn’t have been there.	Ma kellux ikun hemm.
This was definitely a problem.	Din żgur kienet problema.
Don't do this to me.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan lili.
She was so good to me.	Hija kienet daqshekk tajba miegħi.
This must happen.	Dan għandu jiġri.
I understood.	Kont nifhem.
This is how it is done.	Dan huwa kif isir.
Maybe a lot of things.	Forsi ħafna affarijiet.
In fact he was not there.	Fil-fatt hu ma kienx hemm.
He is going to school.	Huwa se jmur l-iskola.
But it works.	Imma hekk jaħdem.
No where to go.	L-ebda fejn tmur.
That's all you are.	Dak kollu int.
I don't have the time.	M'għandix il-ħin.
I’m not hearing this.	Jien mhux qed nisma dan.
Everyone great with him.	Kulħadd kbir miegħu.
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi le.
In fact it is one.	Fil-fatt huwa wieħed.
I'm supposed to be talking.	Jien suppost qed nitkellem.
And it was.	U kien.
Maybe I saw this.	Forsi rajt dan.
She will do a good job.	Hi se tagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
And for me.	U għalija.
I knew better.	Kont naf aħjar.
And sometimes that works.	U xi drabi dan jaħdem.
This was still his home.	Din kienet għadha d-dar tiegħu.
Maybe that’s not such a bad thing.	Forsi dik mhix ħaġa daqshekk ħażina.
It had been a long time.	Kien ilu żmien twil.
I couldn’t talk or anything.	Ma stajtx nitkellem jew xejn.
If you’re tired, you can’t do that.	Jekk int għajjien, ma tistax tagħmel dan.
Just maybe this actually works.	Biss forsi dan fil-fatt jaħdem.
She had to see it coming.	Hi kellha tara dan ġej.
Nothing really gets better than that.	Xejn verament isir aħjar minn hekk.
He had no idea how he got there.	Ma kellux idea kif kien wasal hemm.
Great job.	Xogħol kbir.
That was wrong.	Dak kien ħażin.
No one could have been there at that time.	Ħadd ma seta’ diġà kien hemm dak iż-żmien.
You can't think that.	Ma tistax taħseb hekk.
And here she is.	U hawn hi.
He took another.	Huwa ħa ieħor.
I don’t usually do that.	Normalment ma nagħmel dan.
Something or someone.	Xi ħaġa jew xi ħadd.
This happened here.	Dan ġara hawn.
Nor will we ever.	Lanqas se aħna qatt.
I love being me.	Inħobb inkun jien.
This would be more difficult.	Dan ikun aktar diffiċli.
These are my things.	Dawn huma l-affarijiet tiegħi.
I understand now.	Nifhem issa.
Only in the afternoon.	Wara nofsinhar biss.
I didn’t have to say anything.	Jien ma kelli ngħid xejn.
He told me no.	Huwa qalli le.
I was all his.	Jien kont kollox tiegħu.
You want to see if it was good.	Tixtieq tara jekk kinitx tajba.
I have an idea for what we can do.	Għandi idea għal dak li nistgħu nagħmlu.
Not a good one, a great one.	Mhux waħda tajba, waħda kbira.
I understand now.	Nifhem issa.
I'm just waiting.	Qed nistenna biss.
There may be.	Jista 'jkun hemm.
I had a way of making some money.	Kelli mod kif nagħmel ftit flus.
There must be a better way!	Għandu jkun hemm mod aħjar!
I knew it would.	Kont naf li kieku.
Now, there is just one other thing.	Issa, hemm biss ħaġa oħra.
He was here first.	Kien hawn l-ewwel.
It won’t be the last time, either.	Ma tkunx l-aħħar darba, lanqas.
She was right.	Kellha raġun.
I didn’t.	Jien ma kontx.
She could see it all.	Hija kienet tara dan kollu.
My book happens to be both.	Il-ktieb tiegħi jiġri li jkun it-tnejn.
I don't like anyone here.	Jien ma bħal ħadd hawn.
Look here.	Ħares hawn.
It's too bad.	Huwa ħażin wisq.
It is working well.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb.
I think we did.	Naħseb li għamilna.
It was so good.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb.
You have to be ready for anything.	Int trid tkun lest għal kull ħaġa.
More than you actually see.	Aktar milli fil-fatt tara.
There must be a better way to do this.	Għandu jkun hemm mod aħjar kif isir dan.
It wasn’t good to be alone.	Ma kinitx tajba biex tkun waħedha.
So here too.	Hekk ukoll hawn.
No, that was not a good idea.	Le, din ma kinitx idea tajba.
He could never tell where it started.	Qatt ma seta’ jgħid minn fejn beda.
Probably more.	Probabbilment tkun aktar.
It was our thing.	Kienet ħaġa tagħna.
I have to talk to him.	Ikolli nitkellem miegħu.
This happened very quickly.	Dan ġara malajr ħafna.
He said it should be this.	Qal li għandu jkun dan.
That had never happened to me.	Dak qatt ma kien ġara għalija.
To some people.	Lil xi nies.
It doesn’t look like that.	Ma jidhirx hekk.
I know it’s bad for me.	Naf li huwa ħażin għalija.
It had to be now.	Kellu jkun issa.
I also know it’s good for him.	Naf ukoll li huwa tajjeb għalih.
She probably didn't know anyone there.	Probabbilment ma kienet taf lil ħadd hemmhekk.
Today we had a good time.	Illum kellna ħin tajjeb.
Well, that may be what is about to happen.	Ukoll, dan jista 'jkun dak li wasal biex jiġri.
That was right.	Dak kien kif suppost.
But there is no such thing.	Imma m'hemm l-ebda ħaġa bħal din.
It never was.	Qatt ma kien.
The evening was difficult.	Il-lejla kienet diffiċli.
You're so bad.	Inti ħażin ħażin.
And everything, like everyone else, works.	U kollox, bħal kulħadd, jaħdem.
I want to hear it.	Irrid nisma’.
I want to try that today.	Irrid nipprova hekk illum.
It really didn't have to work that hard.	Tassew ma kellux għalfejn jaħdem daqshekk.
And they do.	U li jagħmlu.
It's just money.	Huwa biss flus.
I hope it goes well.	Nispera li tmur tajjeb.
I want you to know that.	Irrid li tkun taf dak.
Who knows where he will be next week.	Min jaf fejn se jkun il-ġimgħa d-dieħla.
There was nothing.	Ma kien hemm xejn.
Anyone can do any job.	Kulħadd jista' jagħmel kull xogħol.
They didn’t feel good about anyone or anything.	Ma ħassu tajjeb dwar ħadd jew xejn.
He knows it won’t be easy.	Jaf li mhux se jkun faċli.
I love it that way.	Jien inħobb hekk.
If you know what you’re doing and why, fine.	Jekk taf x'qed tagħmel u għaliex, tajjeb.
No one was really scared.	Ħadd ma kien verament jibża.
He started to leave.	Beda jitlaq.
We don't.	M'għandniex.
Until it's too late.	Sakemm ikun tard wisq.
The same thing happens here, every time.	L-istess jiġri hawn, kull darba.
I see that now.	Nara li issa.
You can do whatever you want.	Tista’ tkun dak kollu li trid.
But it’s not as big a problem as you think.	Imma mhix problema kbira daqskemm taħseb.
They were just there.	Kienu hemm biss.
I believe he should.	Nemmen li għandu.
Also, you had another husband.	Barra minn hekk, kellek raġel ieħor.
I think this is it.	Naħseb li dan hu.
We can never.	Qatt ma nistgħu.
That’s what a lot of people do.	Dak hu li jagħmlu ħafna nies.
But that's it.	Imma dak hu.
Until recently.	Sa ftit.
Well, not great.	Tajjeb, mhux kbir.
And they are right.	U għandhom raġun.
I believe everything you are saying.	Nemmen dak kollu li qed tgħid.
But nothing was done.	Imma ma sar xejn.
It’s just what you have to do.	Huwa biss dak li għandek tagħmel.
Whatever that is.	Ikun xi jkun dak.
As much as possible.	Kemm jista’ jkun.
I have heard much of this.	Smajt ħafna minn dan.
Only you can do that.	Inti biss tista 'tagħmel dan.
But not here or now.	Imma mhux hawn jew issa.
I have some idea.	Għandi xi idea.
They never will.	Huma qatt ma se.
He was buying that book.	Kien jixtri dak il-ktieb.
But that was good.	Imma dan kien tajjeb.
No one had ever done that.	Ħadd qatt ma kien għamel hekk.
You know things that won’t.	Int taf affarijiet li mhux se.
And a boy was looking good.	U tifel kien qed jidher tajjeb.
You can stay home with us.	Tista' toqgħod id-dar magħna.
Don't do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan.
I'll tell you about that later.	I ser ngħidlek dwar dan aktar tard.
Well not alone.	Ukoll mhux għadu biss.
We were here.	Konna hawn.
But, you know?	Imma, taf?
These were his things.	Dawn kienu l-affarijiet tiegħu.
I can't believe it.	Ma nistax nemmen.
It just looks good.	Jidher biss tajjeb.
You will be with me forever.	Int tkun miegħi għal dejjem.
Obviously you know.	Ovvjament taf.
I know exactly what you need.	Naf eżatt dak li għandek bżonn.
There are so many.	Hemm tant.
I loved talking to him.	Kont inħobb nitkellem miegħu.
He probably did too.	Probabbilment għamel ukoll.
No one else does.	Ħadd ieħor ma jagħmel.
And you.	U int.
Everyone wants to work from there.	Kulħadd irid jaħdem minn hekk.
As surely there was one.	Kif żgur kien hemm wieħed.
About a boy.	Dwar tifel.
I know for sure.	Naf li żgur.
This was one for me.	Din kienet waħda għalija.
It was coming.	Kien jiġi.
It came so fast.	Wasal daqshekk malajr.
That may have been difficult.	Dak seta’ kien diffiċli.
You have to tell the truth.	Int trid tgħid il-verità.
No, it couldn't have happened.	Le, ma setax ġara.
Something has to be done about it as well.	Ikun irid isir xi ħaġa dwar dan ukoll.
Why is everyone talking so fast?	Għaliex kulħadd jitkellem daqshekk malajr?
I couldn't be late.	Ma stajtx inkun tard.
He does, and he should.	Jagħmel, u għandu.
I came back.	Ġejt lura.
I’m pretty sure this is it.	Jien pjuttost ċert li dan hu.
If he can.	Jekk jista’.
He enjoyed working there.	Kien jieħu gost jaħdem hemmhekk.
But not enough.	Imma mhux biżżejjed.
There was something wrong.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa ħażina.
He is the one who makes things happen.	Huwa dak li jagħmel l-affarijiet.
Before we knew about any of this.	Qabel ma konna nafu dwar xi ħaġa minn dan.
I thought I was at work.	Ħsibt li kont fuq ix-xogħol.
We will be back!	Se nkunu lura!
It is very difficult sometimes.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna xi drabi.
He could not do that.	Ma setax jagħmel dan.
I have something on someone else.	Għandi xi ħaġa fuq xi ħadd ieħor.
It was a great thing.	Kienet xi ħaġa kbira.
It goes together.	Hija tmur flimkien.
This is it! 	Dan hu!
He can't see things very well.	Ma jistax jara l-affarijiet tajjeb ħafna.
That you want.	Li trid.
You can be a man later.	Tista 'tkun raġel aktar tard.
But it won’t be so bad for you.	Imma mhux se jkun daqshekk ħażin għalik.
I try to do what is right.	Nipprova nagħmel dak li hu tajjeb.
It was hard, it was hard.	Kien diffiċli, kien diffiċli.
All the time actually.	Il-ħin kollu fil-fatt.
But it wasn’t just that.	Imma ma kienx hekk biss.
No one had thought of doing this before, either.	Ħadd ma kien ħaseb li jagħmel dan qabel, lanqas.
That’s not what I want.	Dan mhux dak li rrid.
I don’t know why, I do.	Jien ma nafx għalfejn, jien.
Maybe not bad as it seems.	Forsi mhux ħażin kif jidher.
That was nothing.	Dak ma kien xejn.
Now he was able to think.	Issa kien kapaċi jaħseb.
Surely you can see that he is right.	Żgur li tista’ tara li għandu raġun.
Maybe it won't be so bad.	Forsi mhux se jkun daqshekk ħażin.
Now they were here.	Issa kienu hawn.
He was not going to leave.	Ma kienx se jitlaq.
I have been waiting to do this for a long time.	Ilni nistenna li nagħmel hekk għal żmien twil.
I can't understand why it's not working.	Ma nistax nifhem għaliex mhux qed jaħdem.
It's a good idea, actually.	Hija idea tajba, fil-fatt.
You stand for what is good.	Inti toqgħod għal dak li hu tajjeb.
I have no problem with it.	M'għandix problema miegħu.
We never really did anything.	Qatt verament għamilna xejn.
It’s like being home.	Huwa bħal li tkun id-dar.
When he came back he was not doing well.	Meta ġie lura ma kienx sejjer tajjeb.
I’m just telling you it’s the same.	Jien biss ngħidlek li hu l-istess.
There is something for everyone here.	Hemm xi ħaġa għal kulħadd hawn.
I couldn’t, of course.	Ma stajtx, ovvjament.
What is it about.	X'inhu dwar.
He was worried there.	Kien inkwetat hemmhekk.
That’s not good for anyone.	Dak mhu tajjeb għal ħadd.
He was just sitting there.	Kien biss bilqiegħda hemmhekk.
You have enough time.	Għandek ħin biżżejjed.
You can do whatever you need.	Tista 'tagħmel dak kollu li għandek bżonn.
It would be so here.	Ikun hekk hawn.
Everyone lived like that.	Kulħadd kien jgħix hekk.
But that’s not what happens.	Imma dan mhux dak li jiġri.
He is a really good man.	Huwa raġel tassew tajjeb.
When he went back, it was too late.	Meta mar lura, kien tard wisq.
Is there anyone?	Hemm xi ħadd?
Something like this and that.	Xi ħaġa bħal din u din.
But maybe that was good.	Imma forsi dan kien tajjeb.
I don’t like that.	Jien ma nħobbx hekk.
You really shouldn't do that.	Int verament m'għandekx tagħmel dan.
I have to do something.	Ikolli nagħmel xi ħaġa.
He wasn’t ready, he wasn’t ready.	Ma kienx lest, ma kienx lest.
And so here.	U hekk hawn.
It was my first time there.	Kienet l-ewwel darba tiegħi hemmhekk.
I don’t know how to do that.	Ma nafx kif tagħmel dan.
You can do this on your own.	Tista 'tagħmel dan waħdek.
That was until recently.	Dan kien sa ftit ilu.
It’s the same thing every year.	Hija l-istess ħaġa kull sena.
You have to go.	Trid tmur.
U u u.	U u u.
Good thing to think about.	Ħaġa tajba biex taħseb.
There was so much she didn’t know.	Tant kien hemm li ma kinitx taf.
Now it's just you and me.	Issa aħna biss int u jien.
You can see forever.	Tista 'tara għal dejjem.
It was more.	Kien aktar.
How great it is for him.	Kemm hu kbir għalih.
I say no.	Jien ngħid li mhux.
I don't want to see this.	Ma rridx nara dan.
One.	Waħda.
This happened morning after morning.	Dan ġara filgħodu wara filgħodu.
Maybe a bit too much.	Forsi daqsxejn wisq.
He knew she would.	Kien jaf kieku kellha.
And it always will be.	U dejjem se jkun.
I want you to tell me everything.	Irrid li tgħidli kollox.
Time has passed.	Iż-żmien għadda.
No one else seemed to take it.	Ħadd ieħor deher li ħa.
I do that too.	Jien nagħmel hekk ukoll.
It seemed like such a good idea.	Deher qisu idea tajba daqshekk.
If so, so be it.	Jekk hekk hu, hekk hu.
Everyone wants to talk about it.	Kulħadd irid jitkellem dwarha.
But when you think about it, it’s a really big one.	Imma meta taħseb dwarha, hija tassew waħda kbira.
I wanted you.	Jien ridt int.
No one else on.	Ħadd ieħor dwar.
He was planning something.	Kien qed jippjana xi ħaġa.
Outside was outside.	Barra kien barra.
Everyone has a car.	Kulħadd għandu karozza.
You are just as good as you are.	Inti tajjeb eżatt kif int.
I don’t know how, but he is.	Ma nafx kif, imma hu.
Really want to see.	Tassew li trid tara.
But not much.	Imma mhux ħafna.
He had told no one.	Huwa kien qal lil ħadd.
It really happened.	Tassew ġara.
Very little about it.	Ftit li xejn dwar dan.
If you think you are surprised.	Jekk taħseb li inti sorpriż.
Sure enough, passed.	Żgur biżżejjed, għadda.
I can’t take it anymore.	Ma nistax nieħu aktar.
I need to be like everyone else.	Għandi bżonn inkun bħal kulħadd.
But you won't.	Imma int mhux se.
He had to do something.	Kellu jagħmel xi ħaġa.
And she didn't know you knew.	U hi ma kinitx taf li int taf.
And this is not happening.	U dan mhux qed jiġri.
Not so long.	Mhux daqshekk twil.
I have to say.	Ikolli ngħid.
But he couldn’t say so.	Imma ma setax jgħid hekk.
But first things first.	Imma l-ewwel affarijiet l-ewwel.
And that would be saying something.	U dan ikun qed jgħid xi ħaġa.
I’m so scared of him.	Jien tant nibża għalih.
We have what you need.	Aħna għandna dak li għandek bżonn.
Please don't be so.	Jekk jogħġbok ma tkun hekk.
Much more than that.	Ħafna aktar minn hekk.
But today almost no one lives like that.	Imma llum kważi ħadd jgħix hekk.
I have a lot of money.	Għandi ħafna flus.
Not for now.	Mhux għal issa.
This seems to have come out now.	Dan jidher li ħareġ issa.
He sees something.	Huwa jara xi ħaġa.
It's so here.	Huwa hekk hawn.
Now, that was when it was ready.	Issa, kien meta kien lest.
This is great.	Dan huwa kbir.
It is working for us.	Qed jaħdem għalina.
It can do a good job.	Hija tista 'tagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
Very glad to be here.	Ferħan ħafna li qiegħed hawn.
It really isn't.	Huwa verament mhux.
There is only one problem.	Hemm problema waħda biss.
This is not a good idea.	Din mhix idea tajba.
It's there.	Qiegħed hemm.
It was really hard to see that.	Kien tassew diffiċli biex tara dan.
It's bad to be here.	Huwa ħażin li għandu jkun hawn.
It's what you want.	Huwa dak li trid.
You never have to.	Inti qatt ma għandek.
It was bad.	Kien ħażin.
I want to say something here.	Nixtieq ngħid xi ħaġa hawn.
But now it was too late.	Imma issa kien tard wisq.
It came from above.	Ġie minn fuq.
This was definitely not going to be easy.	Dan żgur ma kienx se jkun faċli.
That's it.	Dak hu.
It was a lot.	Kien ħafna.
That was something.	Li kienet xi ħaġa.
This should not be done.	Dan m'għandux isir.
But he was not alone.	Imma ma kienx waħdu.
He was ready to try again.	Kien lest li jerġa' jipprova dan.
He can be really good.	Huwa jista 'jkun verament tajjeb.
Being ready for almost anything is a good idea.	Li tkun lest għal kważi kull ħaġa hija idea tajba.
Everything will be fine.	Kollox ikun tajjeb.
No one said it was so.	Ħadd ma qal li kien hekk.
Well, almost nothing.	Ukoll, kważi xejn.
This had happened before.	Dan kien ġara qabel.
It wasn’t there.	Ma kienx hemm hemm.
Also, not only that.	Barra minn hekk, mhux biss dan.
Another better way.	Mod ieħor aħjar.
He didn't have time.	Ma kellux ħin.
But no one knew what to do about it.	Imma ħadd ma kien jaf jagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
That was enough for me.	Dan kien biżżejjed għalija.
It’s time to go.	Wasal iż-żmien li mmorru.
Like more than any of these things.	Bħal aktar minn kull waħda minn dawn l-affarijiet.
To be there for me.	Li tkun hemm għalija.
So is everyone here.	Hekk qed jagħmel kulħadd hawn.
No, it was more than beautiful.	Le, kienet aktar minn sabiħa.
I needed to talk to him.	Kelli bżonn nitkellem miegħu.
He knew what needed to be done.	Kien jaf x’kien hemm bżonn isir.
He said exactly the same thing.	Qal eżatt l-istess ħaġa.
She knew why he had come.	Kienet taf għaliex kien ġie.
, as you wish.	, kif trid.
He went there.	Huwa mar hemmhekk.
Maybe, there was something wrong with me.	Forsi, kien hemm xi ħaġa ħażina miegħi.
Which is good for me.	Li huwa tajjeb minni.
I’m not sure if that’s what you need.	M'inix ċert jekk hux dak li għandek bżonn.
It was a difficult time for us there.	Kien żmien diffiċli għalina hemmhekk.
He doesn’t have to sit and sit.	M'għandux għalfejn joqgħod u joqgħod.
You know how that would be.	Taf kif ikun dak.
He left.	Huwa telaq.
Now, friend.	Issa, ħabib.
But it’s still coming.	Imma għadu ġej.
Not only that.	Mhux dan biss.
Everyone is talking about it.	Kulħadd qed jitkellem dwarha.
Hu.	Hu.
This was my last chance.	Din kienet l-aħħar ċans tiegħi.
It’s for me, he thought.	Huwa għalija, ħaseb.
He didn't.	Huwa ma.
You will be surprised.	Int tkun sorpriż.
He will be here tomorrow.	Hu se jkun hawn għada.
He seemed worried.	Huwa deher inkwetat.
He started talking.	Beda jitkellem.
Nobody really knows what happened.	Ħadd ma jaf tassew x’ġara.
No one was eating.	Ħadd ma kien jiekol.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
Does anyone else think this is a bad idea?	Xi ħadd ieħor jaħseb li din hija idea ħażina?.
Now he was interested.	Issa kien interessat.
When he died.	Meta miet.
He just wanted to get home.	Ried biss jasal id-dar.
There was little time to do anything.	Kien hemm ftit ħin biex tagħmel xi ħaġa.
Not something like that, it wasn’t.	Mhux ħaġa bħal dik, ma kienx.
Either or both are good.	Jew jew it-tnejn huwa tajjeb.
Good thing something is going well.	Tajjeb li xi ħaġa tmur tajjeb.
There may be more.	Jista 'jkun hemm aktar.
He was said to know everything.	Kien qal li jaf kollox.
I was very young.	Kont żgħir ħafna.
I'm me.	Jien jien.
Not much, that’s for sure.	Mhux ħafna, dan żgur.
Look at each other.	Ħares lejn xulxin.
That was enough.	Dan kien biżżejjed.
It's from later.	Huwa minn aktar tard.
But this has not always been easy.	Imma dan mhux dejjem kien faċli.
That has always been the case.	Hekk kien dejjem.
But he could have much more.	Imma seta’ jkollu ħafna aktar.
All this can be yours.	Dan kollu jista’ jkun tiegħek.
It was so.	Kien hekk.
I fell in love with him.	Kont inħobb miegħu.
He could come and go as he pleased.	Seta’ jiġi u jmur kif irid.
You really can do that.	Int verament tista 'tagħmel dan.
He was still there.	Kien għadu hemm.
Of what you are.	Ta’ dak int.
He came here yesterday.	Ġie hawn ilbieraħ.
He just told the truth.	Huwa biss qal il-verità.
Today is not going too well.	Illum mhux sejjer tajjeb wisq.
He put it there.	Huwa poġġa hemm.
I’ve been there once.	Jien kont hemm darba.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Int żgur li trid tagħmel dan?
Little, actually.	Ftit, fil-fatt.
It wasn’t that long ago.	Ma kienx daqshekk twil ilu.
I was thinking about it.	Kont qed naħseb dwar dan.
Now it could be anyone.	Issa jista 'jkun xi ħadd.
It was enough.	Kien biżżejjed.
He will do nothing.	Mhu se jagħmel xejn.
This had never happened to me before.	Dan qatt ma kien ġara lili qabel.
I love the book.	Inħobb il-ktieb.
You have to stay.	Trid toqgħod.
It looks like this.	Jidher bħal dan.
It took him a while to get back.	Huwa ħa xi żmien biex jerġa 'lura.
I would be very happy if you.	Inkun kuntent ħafna jekk inti.
Obviously your house is yours.	Ovvjament id-dar tiegħek hija tiegħek.
I'm with you.	Jien miegħek.
Get here as fast as you can!	Wasal hawn malajr kemm tista'!
That was too much for me.	Dan kien wisq għalija.
I can’t understand this problem.	Jien ma nistax nifhem din il-problema.
It's like you're talking to someone.	Qisu qed titkellem ma’ xi ħadd.
Looks like there was someone else.	Qisu kien hemm xi ħadd ieħor.
This is not working.	Dan mhux qed jaħdem.
He might think about it later.	Huwa seta 'jaħseb dwar dan aktar tard.
He couldn’t wait for this to go away.	Ma setax jistenna li dan imur.
One chance, maybe.	Ċans wieħed, forsi.
I was the only one.	Jien kont l-uniku wieħed.
He had hoped he would.	Huwa kien jittama li kieku.
Anyone can do that.	Kulħadd jista 'jagħmel dan.
We did a lot of things together.	Għamilna ħafna affarijiet flimkien.
There is almost nothing we can do.	M'hemm kważi xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu.
It will not be difficult.	Mhux se jkun diffiċli.
Nothing is wrong.	Xejn mhu ħażin.
Or if you’re worried about something.	Jew jekk int inkwetat dwar xi ħaġa.
Who was it.	Min kien.
I want to talk to him.	Irrid nitkellem miegħu.
It's easier for him to.	Huwa aktar faċli għalih għal.
You can’t do both.	Ma tistax tagħmel it-tnejn.
I said now.	għidt issa.
She didn’t know why she was going to do something like that.	Ma kinitx taf għaliex kien se jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I don't know anymore.	Ma nafx aktar.
I’m sure there’s more.	Jien ċert li hemm aktar.
No one appeared.	Ħadd ma deher.
It wasn't good.	Ma kienx tajjeb.
That looked pretty good.	Li deher pjuttost tajjeb.
I’ve seen something like this before.	Rajt xi ħaġa bħal din qabel.
It was morning.	Kien filgħodu.
He is such a good man.	Huwa daqshekk raġel tajjeb.
It will take too long.	Se jieħu wisq ħin.
How much money do you have?	Kemm għandek flus?
He didn't seem to be doing much.	Jidher li ma tantx kien qed jagħmel xejn.
I want everything, please.	Irrid kollox, jekk jogħġbok.
I want him to leave.	Irrid li jitlaq.
I understand why I couldn’t.	Nifhem għaliex ma stajtx.
Okay, let’s do that.	Tajjeb, ejja nagħmlu dan.
It does well.	Jagħmel tajjeb.
I have seen you before.	Rajt inti qabel.
He must be home.	Huwa għandu jkun id-dar.
That's how you are.	Huwa hekk int.
He loved that book.	Kien iħobb dak il-ktieb.
I was surprised by this.	Kont sorpriż b’dan.
They have to do something about it.	Għandhom jagħmlu xi ħaġa dwarha.
It was today.	Kienet illum.
Don't be late.	Tkunx tard.
It was the first time.	Kienet l-ewwel darba.
As he said, it was not what it was.	Kif qal, ma kienx dak li kien.
He once said.	Darba qal.
I think this will be a better one for him.	Naħseb li dan se jkun aħjar ieħor għalih.
Now he knew why.	Issa kien jaf għaliex.
Nothing was certain.	Xejn ma kien ċert.
So many times.	Tant drabi.
He wasn't so sure.	Ma kienx daqshekk ċert.
And you have to stay three hours.	U trid toqgħod tliet sigħat.
He seemed so worried.	Huwa deher tant inkwetat.
It's right here.	Huwa eżatt hawn.
She never did that.	Hija qatt li dan.
That was probably good.	Li probabbilment kien tajjeb.
No, he should have been telling the truth.	Le, kellu jkun qed jgħid il-verità.
I think she didn’t know better.	Naħseb li ma kinitx taf aħjar.
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
He said he would come tomorrow.	Qal li kien jiġi għada.
After hours it wasn’t much better.	Wara sigħat ma kienx ħafna aħjar.
You know how it goes.	Taf kif sejjer.
It has never been so before.	Qatt ma kien hekk qabel.
It had to be one.	Kellu jkun wieħed.
He’s not doing much right now.	Mhux qed jagħmel ħafna bħalissa.
She had never been in love before.	Hija qatt ma kienet inħobb qabel.
You know who he is.	Taf min hu.
You don't have to do that.	Inti m'għandekx tagħmel dan.
We had the first one thing.	Kellna l-ewwel ħaġa waħda.
Everyone needs to play this.	Kulħadd jeħtieġ li jilgħab dan.
No, that was a bad idea.	Le, dik kienet idea ħażina.
I wasn’t sure what I was going to do.	Jien ma kontx ċert x'se nagħmel.
Such a man would not only take what he wanted.	Raġel bħal dan ma kienx jieħu biss dak li jrid.
It's all around here.	Huwa kulħadd madwar hawn.
He will think.	Huwa ser jaħseb.
I was glad to hear that.	Kont ferħan li smajt dan.
Tired.	Għajjien.
You should go if you are able.	Għandek tmur jekk int kapaċi.
There is no way this can happen.	M'hemm l-ebda mod kif dan jista 'jiġri.
I did nothing wrong.	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin.
It was hard not to when his friend was around.	Kien diffiċli li ma meta ħabib tiegħu kien madwar.
But we probably already know this as well.	Imma probabbilment diġà nafu dan ukoll.
There is little we can do.	Ma tantx nistgħu nagħmlu.
He is small and plays small.	Huwa żgħir u jilgħab żgħir.
He can do anything.	Jista’ jagħmel xi ħaġa.
He was no help.	Hu ma kienx xi għajnuna.
He's not as good as ever.	Hu mhux tajjeb daqs qatt qabel.
Tomorrow would come.	Għada kien jiġi.
And this is what you have to do.	U dan huwa dak li għandek tagħmel.
They do this before they do anything else.	Huma jagħmlu dan qabel ma jagħmlu xi ħaġa oħra.
I don’t think you know either.	Ma naħsibx li lanqas taf.
But that’s what you want about it.	Imma dak hu li tixtieq dwar dan.
So I said.	Hekk għidt.
Anyone can see that.	Kulħadd jista 'jara li.
He was very happy to become one.	Kien kuntent ħafna li sar wieħed.
I actually didn’t know who he really was.	Fil-fatt ma kontx naf min kien tassew.
This is your school.	Din hija l-iskola tiegħek.
It was nothing like that.	Ma kienet hekk xejn.
Maybe you know me.	Forsi taf minni.
A long time ago, in fact.	Żmien twil ilu, fil-fatt.
And maybe they are right.	U forsi għandhom raġun.
But nothing.	Imma xejn.
This seemed to be done more than about the dog.	Dan deher li sar aktar milli dwar il-kelb.
I don’t know what will happen next.	Ma nafx x'se jiġri wara.
But there is no one else.	Imma m'hemm ħadd ieħor.
Same as it was.	L-istess kif kien.
We are just friends.	Aħna biss ħbieb.
Time will tell on this.	Iż-żmien se jgħid fuq dan.
But now that it’s time, it comes really easy.	Imma issa li wasal iż-żmien, jiġi verament faċli.
And I think it will.	U naħseb li se.
Not good enough.	Mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
She wasn't going to come.	Ma kinitx se tiġi.
I really wish she was here.	Nixtieq tassew li kienet hawn.
Maybe it's something else.	Forsi hija xi ħaġa oħra.
We have friends.	Għandna ħbieb.
We just want it to be there.	Irridu li jkun hemm biss.
I know it will.	Naf li se.
.	.
It just so happened that he was there.	Ġara biss li kien hemm.
This almost works.	Dan kważi jaħdem.
And, there will be more.	U, se jkun hemm aktar.
I don't, of course.	Jien ma, ovvjament.
He thought he was going to do it.	Ħaseb li kien se jagħmel.
And she actually looks very beautiful.	U hi fil-fatt tidher sabiħa ħafna.
She was that.	Hija kienet dik.
And we did.	U għamilna.
I need some quick money.	Għandi bżonn ftit flus malajr.
Everything is still here.	Kollox għadu hawn.
I believe there is a better way.	Nemmen li hemm mod aħjar.
He seemed a little worried.	Huwa deher ftit inkwetat.
I think that's good.	Naħseb li tajjeb.
I was doing that.	Jien kont qed nagħmel hekk.
He went too far.	Huwa mar wisq.
Here you are !.	Hawn int!.
Almost the same.	Kważi l-istess.
You want, you want, you want !.	Trid, trid, trid!.
We actually do something about it.	Fil-fatt nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwarha.
But it's late.	Imma huwa tard.
This is another.	Dan huwa ieħor.
A friend was with me.	Ħabib kien miegħi.
He wanted another but thought better.	Ried ieħor imma ħaseb aħjar.
We know what it is.	Nafu x’inhu.
Again, he thought.	Darba oħra, ħaseb.
This is a good one.	Din hija waħda tajba.
Never say you’re not good enough.	Qatt tgħid li m'intix tajjeb biżżejjed.
I really have no way of saying.	Verament m'għandi l-ebda mod kif ngħid.
I'm not a person.	Jien mhux persuna.
We know who.	Aħna min nafu.
He was ready to leave.	Kien lest li jitlaq.
Well, obviously not for me.	Ukoll, ovvjament mhux għalija.
I can’t tell you to do that.	Ma nistax ngħidlek tagħmel dan.
As well	Kif ukoll
But it was too good for everyone.	Imma kien tajjeb wisq għal kulħadd.
But we know what we know.	Imma nafu dak li nafu.
And up to a few more.	U sa ftit aktar.
It wasn’t work.	Ma kienx xogħol.
We want to be together.	Irridu nkunu flimkien.
This was much better.	Dan kien ħafna aħjar.
It will be something.	Se tkun xi ħaġa.
Sometimes they do.	Xi drabi jagħmlu.
But he already knew.	Imma hu diġà kien jaf.
He never had anyone left here alone.	Qatt ma kellu lil ħadd jibqa’ hawn waħdu.
I need to sit down.	Għandi bżonn noqgħod bilqiegħda.
I will not go with you now.	Mhux se mmur aktar miegħek issa.
Or so it seems.	Jew hekk jidher.
You don’t want any of that.	Ma trid xejn minn dan.
It still doesn't work.	Għadu mhux jaħdem.
I still wasn’t sure about that.	Għadu ma kienx ċert dwar dan.
Okay, let's go.	Tajjeb, ejja mmorru.
He was no longer a man, but just a big boy.	Ma kienx aktar raġel, imma biss tifel kbir.
She still didn’t know.	Kienet għadha ma kinitx taf.
I see someone leave in the back.	Nara lil xi ħadd jitlaq fuq wara.
But there was someone back there.	Imma kien hemm xi ħadd hemm lura.
You have to go around.	Għandek tmur madwar.
It's just not here.	Huwa biss mhux hawn.
I don’t do anything like that.	Jien ma nagħmel xejn bħal dan.
I'm doing very well.	Jien sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
This will help.	Dan se jgħin.
She will never be with me.	Qatt ma se tkun miegħi.
That was good.	Dak kien tajjeb.
On and on.	Fuq u fuq.
You can't do wrong.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel ħażin.
He didn’t tell me anything.	Ma qalli xejn.
It looks good.	Jidher li hu tajjeb.
I never wanted to.	Jien qatt ma ridt.
I hope you do.	Nispera li tagħmel.
Not for a job like that.	Mhux għal xogħol bħal dak.
I hope you do.	Nispera li tagħmel.
But it was something to do.	Imma kienet xi ħaġa li tagħmel.
But you know.	Imma taf.
Like that last one.	Bħal dik l-aħħar waħda.
That is for sure.	Dan huwa ċert.
I knew it was him.	Kont naf li kien hu.
I can be anyone.	Jien nista’ nkun xi ħadd.
And that was hard enough.	U dan kien diffiċli biżżejjed.
And you have to.	U għandek.
I need my friends.	Għandi bżonn ħbieb tiegħi.
I thought I was there.	Ħsibt li kont hemm.
Someone is talking.	Xi ħadd qed jitkellem.
I really don’t want to know.	Verament ma rridx inkun naf.
You are good.	Inti tajjeb.
I couldn’t wait any longer.	Ma stajtx nistenna aktar.
You cannot do this before or after.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan qabel jew wara.
We never did.	Qatt ma għamilna.
And they are the same.	U huma l-istess.
You will be coming back for more.	Int tkun ġej lura għal aktar.
That is all we can do.	Dan huwa dak kollu li nistgħu nagħmlu.
No one was here but we are just here.	Ma kien hawn ħadd imma aħna eżatt hawn.
He was not so anymore.	Huwa ma kienx hekk aktar.
Plus, he needed time to think.	Barra minn hekk, kellu bżonn il-ħin biex jaħseb.
And he had done it.	U kien għamel dan.
Now she knew what was going to happen.	Issa kienet taf x’kien se jiġri.
It has not been seen for a long time.	Ilu ma deherx.
he asked.	staqsa.
I have to buy one.	Ikolli nixtri waħda.
He agreed to go.	Huwa qabel li jmur.
Who had.	Min kellu.
And it doesn’t look like this is going to happen.	U ma jidhirx li dan se jiġri.
But it wasn’t good enough.	Imma ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed.
Just a little at a time.	Ftit ftit kull darba.
Much more could have been done.	Seta’ sar ħafna aktar.
It should not be very difficult.	M'għandux ikun diffiċli ħafna.
Don't do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan.
She didn't, she didn't for too long.	Hija ma, hi ma għal żmien twil wisq.
But there was more.	Imma kien hemm aktar.
No, not so much.	Le, mhux hekk.
He was a good boy.	Kien tifel tajjeb.
There is no way around this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod madwar dan.
But it is something.	Imma hija xi ħaġa.
But it must.	Imma għandu.
Tired of being the only one.	Għajjien li nkun l-uniku wieħed.
It seemed to come from more than one person.	Deher li ġej minn aktar minn persuna waħda.
At that time it was school.	Dak iż-żmien kien l-iskola.
But not only that.	Imma mhux hekk biss.
An easy one.	Waħda faċli.
You can do this here.	Tista 'tagħmel dan hawn.
I don’t want any of that.	Ma rrid xejn minn hekk.
This is not supposed to happen.	Dan mhux suppost jiġri.
No one is sure what went wrong.	Ħadd mhu ċert x’ġara ħażin.
Who was she? 	Min kienet hi?
I made sure of that.	Jien għamilt ċert minn dan.
This was never going to happen today, he told me.	Dan qatt ma kien se jiġri llum, qalli.
I never even thought about these two together.	Lanqas qatt ma ħsibt dwar dawn it-tnejn flimkien.
Where are you.	Fejn int.
They are a little late with this.	Huma ftit tard b'dan.
He said it well.	Huwa qal tajjeb.
I'm just saying, better be.	Jien ngħid biss, aħjar tiġi.
I don't need to.	M'għandix bżonn.
After so many years, let me not think.	Wara tant snin, biex ma naħsibx.
That's not so bad.	Li mhux daqshekk ħażin.
We are that one.	Aħna dak wieħed.
But not me.	Imma mhux lili.
Probably nothing.	Probabbilment mhu xejn.
I can't have fun tonight.	Ma nistax nieħu gost illejla.
I couldn't.	Jien ma stajtx.
He didn't know.	Ma kienx jaf.
I have to be able to do that.	Għandi nkun kapaċi nagħmel dan.
I was glad we were friends.	Kont ferħan li konna ħbieb.
That's what he wanted.	Dak hu ried.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
I didn’t know enough to try something like that.	Ma kontx naf biżżejjed biex nipprova xi ħaġa bħal dik.
How to Know What a Dog Will Do	Kif tkun taf x'se jagħmel il-kelb.
But she also plays.	Imma hi jilgħab ukoll.
I would be back.	inkun lura.
This will help a lot.	Dan se jgħin ħafna.
No, not so much.	Le, mhux hekk.
I don't know.	ma nafx.
I'll talk to him.	Jien ser nitkellem miegħu.
It should be.	Għandu jkun.
If he doesn't know, he won't know.	Jekk ma jkunx jaf, ma jkunx jaf.
I don’t think he’ll be back until tomorrow.	Ma naħsibx li se jkun lura sa għada.
For us to go.	Għalina mmorru.
But come on.	Imma ejja.
I’m a pretty easy man.	Jien raġel pjuttost faċli.
I don’t do that.	Jien ma nagħmel hekk.
This happens often.	Dan jiġri spiss.
He would later find out everything he needed to know.	Aktar tard kien isir jaf dak kollu li kellu bżonn ikun jaf.
Not on this.	Mhux fuq dan.
This is more than that.	Dan huwa aktar minn hekk.
He was tired all the time.	Kien għajjien il-ħin kollu.
You have to do everything.	Int trid tagħmel kollox.
Nobody about.	Ħadd dwar.
I know how to do it.	Naf kif nagħmel.
I won't.	Jien mhux se.
As we are.	Kif aħna.
I think he had fun.	Naħseb li ħa gost.
Both at work and at home.	Kemm fuq ix-xogħol kif ukoll id-dar.
Why did he have to come?	Għaliex kellu jiġi?
That's right.	Hekk hu.
I try to do a little in the evening.	Nipprova nagħmel ftit filgħaxija.
And no one knows where he is.	U ħadd ma jaf fejn hu.
I can't understand how.	Ma nistax nifhem kif.
I just had to sit down for a while.	I biss kelli noqgħod bilqiegħda għal ftit.
We can do both.	Nistgħu nagħmlu t-tnejn.
That was never good.	Dak qatt ma kien tajjeb.
She was just very tired.	Kienet biss għajjien ħafna.
Just, what are you doing with me.	Biss, x'qed tagħmel miegħi.
What I thought it was.	Dak li ħsibt li kien.
He doesn't look good.	Hu ma jidher tajjeb.
Maybe you want to sit down.	Forsi trid toqgħod bilqiegħda.
Everyone said so.	Kull wieħed qal hekk.
We didn’t know it better.	Ma konna nafu aħjar.
It’s never too late to be what I’ve been through.	Qatt mhu tard wisq biex tkun dak li stajt kont.
But usually not so bad.	Imma normalment mhux daqshekk ħażin.
It looks and looks a bit better.	Jidher u jidher daqsxejn aħjar.
It takes everyone.	Huwa jieħu kulħadd.
And everything will be better.	U kollox se jkun aħjar.
It's too big to fit there.	Huwa kbir wisq biex joqgħod hemm.
Nothing better could have happened.	Xejn aħjar seta’ ġara.
And tell everyone what to do and how to do it.	U għid lil kulħadd x'għandu jagħmel u kif għandu jagħmel.
You don’t have much time.	M'għandekx ħafna ħin.
It's my idea.	Hija idea tiegħi.
There wasn’t much.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna.
I never knew that.	Qatt ma kont naf li.
It's the first.	Huwa l-ewwel.
So too, really.	Hekk ukoll, tassew.
She wants to talk.	Hija trid titkellem.
It will happen on its own.	Se jiġri waħdu.
What happened can happen again.	Dak li ġara jista’ jerġa’ jiġri.
It's a good thing.	Hija ħaġa tajba.
I have a lot.	Għandi ħafna.
Just like a little boy.	Eżatt bħal tifel żgħir.
And it came.	U wasal.
He lost his job, and he had to.	Huwa tilef ix-xogħol tiegħu, u kellu.
We will not go there.	Mhux se mmorru hemm.
But what he wanted was something more.	Imma dak li ried kien xi ħaġa aktar.
There is no one who can say that.	M'hemm ħadd li jista' jgħid dwar dan.
If it is difficult you can do something else.	Jekk huwa diffiċli tista 'tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
He came with me.	Ġie miegħi.
But really.	Imma tassew.
I just couldn’t take it anymore.	I biss ma stajtx tieħu aktar.
It was not coming.	Ma kienx ġej.
It's not you.	Mhuwiex int.
When it comes together it’s great.	Meta jiġi flimkien huwa kbir.
I was going to do that.	Kont se nagħmel dan.
Better sooner than later.	Aħjar aktar kmieni milli wara.
Or something like that.	Jew xi ħaġa bħal dik.
There is nothing for me here.	M'hemm xejn għalija hawn.
That's what he has to do.	Dak hu li għandu.
Or many other things.	Jew ħafna affarijiet oħra.
They are just.	Huma biss.
But she had, and tomorrow she was too.	Imma kellha, u għada kienet ukoll.
I try not to think about what came next.	Nipprova ma naħsibx dwar dak li ġie wara.
I was a bad boy.	Kont tifel ħażin.
I don't have to.	M'għandix.
And me.	U jien.
But it wasn’t the first time.	Imma ma kinitx l-ewwel darba.
And it is working well.	U qed jaħdem tajjeb.
He knew something was very wrong.	Kien jaf li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina ħafna.
And another, and so on forever.	U ieħor, u hekk għal dejjem.
I’m glad that what happened, happened.	Jien ferħan li dak li ġara, ġara.
It is the following.	Huwa dan li ġej.
But she didn't.	Imma hi ma.
When you are young.	Meta tkun żgħir.
Maybe it’s just both.	Forsi huwa biss it-tnejn.
He thought we were friends.	Ħaseb li konna ħbieb.
You will be going home soon.	Inti se tmur id-dar dalwaqt.
My very bad.	Ħażin ħafna tiegħi.
I think that.	Jien naħseb li.
I had enough.	Kelli biżżejjed.
You see.	Qed tara.
Just not now.	Biss mhux issa.
Still.	Għadu.
By then it would be too late.	Sa dak iż-żmien ikun tard wisq.
You are my good friend.	Inti ħabib tajjeb tiegħi.
I’m really into it.	Jien tassew għalih.
Nothing looked wrong.	Xejn ma deher ħażin.
You should be too.	Għandek tkun ukoll.
He never told me.	Hu qatt ma qalli.
I never did that.	Qatt ma għamilt dan.
Maybe he knows.	Forsi jaf.
Where we want to go.	Fejn irridu mmorru.
No one had ever been afraid of me before.	Ħadd qatt ma kien jibża minni qabel.
There are no other people around.	M'hemm l-ebda nies oħra madwar.
But she knew everything.	Imma kienet taf kollox.
If anything, it’s actually harder.	Jekk xejn, huwa fil-fatt aktar diffiċli.
All alone.	Kollha waħdi.
That was enough.	Dan kien biżżejjed.
This is very good.	Dan huwa tajjeb ħafna.
If he did.	Jekk għamel.
I can try.	Nista' nipprova.
I want to do this.	Irrid nagħmel dan.
He comes here often, to talk about it.	Jiġi hawn spiss, biex jitkellem dwarha.
We will do the same.	Se nagħmlu l-istess.
.	.
She says she won't.	Hi tgħid li mhux se.
I was so scared of someone coming.	Tant kont nibża’ li jiġi xi ħadd.
There is no one there.	M'hemm ħadd hemm.
For a while it was a happy time.	Għal xi żmien kien żmien kuntent.
It makes everything harder.	Jagħmel kollox aktar diffiċli.
That was three years ago.	Dan kien tliet snin ilu.
As I said, so are things.	Hekk kif għedt, hekk huma l-affarijiet.
I was ready.	Kont lest.
Around and around.	Madwar u madwar.
Better than nothing, for sure.	Aħjar minn xejn, żgur.
But maybe not.	Imma forsi le.
I just have to believe.	Ikolli biss nemmen.
You'll be home soon.	Int ser tkun id-dar dalwaqt.
It will do the same for you.	Se tagħmel l-istess għalik.
This should do.	Dan għandu jagħmel.
Sometimes so, but for a while.	Xi drabi hekk, imma għal ftit.
You’re not happy, you just think you are.	M'intix kuntent, inti biss taħseb li int.
He will not be able to leave alone.	Mhux se jkun jista’ jitlaq biss.
You can see that.	Inti tista 'tara li.
Sorry for you.	Jiddispjaċini għalik.
I wish I never would.	Nixtieq li qatt ma se.
I’ve seen it here, here, and here.	Rajt hawn, hawn, u hawn.
If something seems out of place, it probably is.	Jekk xi ħaġa tidher barra, probabbilment hija.
But not only that.	Imma mhux hekk biss.
He did not and saw nothing.	Ma għamel u ma ra xejn.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Ma rridx nitkellem dwar dan.
I'm talking.	Qed nitkellem.
It wasn't good.	Ma kienx tajjeb.
It works well.	Jaħdem tajjeb.
All on your own.	Kollha waħdek.
But no, this is wrong.	Imma le, dan huwa ħażin.
It was actually for us.	Fil-fatt kien għalina.
Now we do.	Issa nagħmlu.
I know you are.	Naf li int.
No one died at the time.	Ħadd ma miet dak iż-żmien.
He can go.	Huwa jista 'jmur.
It's been a long time.	Kien żmien twil.
That's not very long.	Dak mhux twil ħafna.
We need to know what's going on there.	Irridu nkunu nafu x’qed jiġri hemmhekk.
I like to do that, actually.	Inħobb nagħmel dan, fil-fatt.
But you didn’t think about it.	Imma int ma kontx ħsibt dwarha.
You can see why.	Tista 'tara għaliex.
He knew what was coming.	Kien jaf x’kien qed jasal.
Now it’s past noon and you want to go.	Issa għadda nofsinhar u trid tmur.
I, as it happens.	Jien, kif jiġri.
And you do.	U inti tagħmel.
You want to see this.	Trid tara dan.
He made sure.	Huwa għamel ċert.
I'm just worried I'm going home.	Jien biss inkwetat li mmur id-dar.
So really not how it happens.	Hekk verament mhux kif jiġri.
Maybe never.	Forsi mhux qatt.
Nothing is ever good, and nothing is ever enough.	Xejn mhu qatt tajjeb, u xejn mhu qatt biżżejjed.
Every time.	Kull darba.
I just always have to.	Jien biss dejjem għandi.
That was all.	Hekk kien biss.
Someone was coming.	Kien ġej xi ħadd.
I knew a little bit.	Jien kont naf xi ftit.
That was all he needed.	Dan kien dak li kellu bżonn.
In fact, that was the first way.	Fil-fatt, dak kien l-ewwel mod.
You have no job.	M'għandekx xogħol.
Really, really fast.	Tassew, tassew malajr.
I never even thought about that one.	Qatt lanqas ħsibt dwar dak wieħed.
If a man.	Jekk raġel.
There he is!	Hemm hu!
I had to be something.	I kellha tkun xi ħaġa.
I think he will be able to come back.	Naħseb li se jkun jista 'jerġa'.
And so it is.	U hekk hu biss.
We need your help.	Għandna bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
It could be good.	Jista 'jkun tajjeb.
But there was one problem.	Imma kien hemm problema waħda.
I said I could go.	Għidt li jista’ jmur.
You are right.	Għandek raġun.
Sometimes this was very difficult.	Xi drabi dan kien diffiċli ħafna.
She eats every three hours.	Hija tiekol kull tliet sigħat.
Why is this so?	Għaliex dan hu hekk?
For a long time.	Għal żmien twil.
It looked good.	Deher tajjeb.
He was probably fine, but he really didn’t want to leave.	Probabbilment kien tajjeb, imma hu verament ma riedx li jitlaq.
He either wasn’t here or he was and he was gone.	Hu jew ma kienx hawn jew kien u kien mar.
He couldn't go with anyone there.	Ma’ xi ħadd hemm ma setax imur.
I never wanted to be.	Qatt ma ridt inkun.
All, all mine.	Kollha, kollha tiegħi.
It seems a little easier.	Jidher ftit ftit aktar faċli.
This is not so.	Dan mhux hekk.
He told me that.	Huwa qalli li.
Not that he ever did.	Mhux li qatt għamel.
Who knew, she probably did.	Min kien jaf, x'aktarx li għamlet.
I want more than that.	Irrid aktar minn hekk.
But better late than never.	Imma aħjar tard milli qatt.
Not just another person, either.	Mhux biss persuna oħra, lanqas.
Everyone is waiting around.	Kulħadd qed jistenna madwar.
But there you go.	Imma hemm tmur.
But there was no time for that.	Imma ma kienx hemm ħin għal dan.
Why don't you.	Għaliex ma inti.
All that will remain.	Dak kollu li se jibqa’ jkun.
Only a year ago today.	Sena biss ilu llum.
Not too much fun.	Mhux wisq gost.
I think everyone knows that.	Naħseb li kulħadd jaf dan.
But that's a good thing.	Imma dik hija ħaġa tajba.
He's just a man.	Huwa biss raġel.
That was something they were doing.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa li kienu qed jagħmlu.
I have the same.	Għandi l-istess.
It wasn't where she was supposed to be.	Ma kinitx fejn kellha tkun.
She's probably there by now.	Probabbilment hija hemm sa issa.
I do what she never did.	Nagħmel dak li hi qatt ma għamlet.
Not so good.	Mhux daqshekk tajjeb.
Or whatever.	Jew tkun xi tkun.
I need to do this for myself.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan għalija.
I had no money.	Ma kelli l-ebda flus.
After all it is working well.	Wara kollox qed jaħdem tajjeb.
I could do without it.	Jien stajt nagħmel mingħajr dan.
The time was mine.	Il-ħin kien tiegħi.
I'm alone here.	Jien waħdi hawn.
That never happened and it can’t.	Dak qatt ma ġara u ma jistax.
That’s what I’ve seen before.	Dik rajt qabel.
I don’t even know what it was.	Lanqas naf dak li kien.
Like, you always were.	Bħal, inti dejjem kont.
I really can.	Jien verament nista.
But only for a time.	Imma għal żmien biss.
They are not.	Ma huma.
Maybe you should.	Forsi għandek.
But it wasn’t.	Imma ma kienx.
But it is not yet.	Imma ma jkunx għadu.
Maybe she'll know.	Forsi hi tkun taf.
Now, he knew.	Issa, kien jaf.
She is good to me.	Hija tajba miegħi.
Not a good thing.	Mhix xi ħaġa tajba.
I’m just glad you’re okay.	Jien kuntent biss li int tajjeb.
It could be you too.	Jista’ jkun ukoll int.
In fact there was a good chance he wouldn’t come back.	Fil-fatt kien hemm ċans tajjeb li ma kienx jiġi lura.
No, he had to stay.	Le, kellu jibqa’.
What may work for one person may not work for another.	Dak li jista 'jaħdem għal persuna waħda jista' mhux għal oħra.
You can do anything and she does that great.	Tista 'tagħmel xi ħaġa u hi tagħmel dak kbir.
He knew he couldn’t wait any longer.	Kien jaf li ma setax jistenna aktar.
But so is he.	Imma hekk hu.
This is actually not too bad.	Dan fil-fatt mhux ħażin wisq.
Int.	Int.
Obviously we are.	Ovvjament aħna.
I'm going to eat something.	Jien ser niekol xi ħaġa.
We can, we want to, and we will do better.	Nistgħu, irridu, u se nagħmlu aħjar.
She was not staying with a man who was.	Hija ma kinitx toqgħod ma 'raġel li kien.
So is she.	Hekk ukoll hi.
When she was last she was back home.	Meta kienet l-aħħar kienet lura d-dar.
I need your help.	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
I don’t do any work.	Jien ma nagħmel l-ebda xogħol.
Each said he had no problem.	Kull wieħed qal li ma kellux problema.
She was thinking of doing exactly the same thing.	Kienet qed taħseb biex tagħmel eżatt l-istess ħaġa.
This happened.	Dan ġara.
It's too early.	Għadu kmieni wisq.
One does not need this.	Wieħed m'għandux bżonn dan.
He was happy	Kien kuntent
He didn't even think.	Lanqas ma ħaseb.
I wish it was otherwise.	Nixtieq li kien mod ieħor.
I won’t even try.	Lanqas se nipprova.
How can that be?	Kif jista’ jkun?
It does nothing.	Dan ma jagħmel xejn.
I was great, actually.	Jien kont kbir, fil-fatt.
Please, just don't.	Jekk jogħġbok, biss le.
Just too well.	Biss wisq ukoll.
Everyone does.	Kulħadd jagħmel.
But if you have a problem, let me have it.	Imma jekk għandek problema, ejja għandi.
What are you doing or planning to do?	Dak li qed tagħmel jew qed tippjana li tagħmel hu?
I’m not doing that.	Jien mhux qed nagħmel dan.
If they are, great.	Jekk huma, kbir.
She was still out.	Kienet għadha barra.
Could it be this ?.	Jista' jkun dan?.
It didn’t have to be.	Ma kellux ikun.
I can't say.	Ma nistax ngħid.
That wasn’t as bad as it really was.	Li ma kienx ħażin daqs kemm kien verament.
.	.
Sure, to each of his own.	Żgur, lil kull wieħed tiegħu.
If you go over both, that’s pretty much it.	Jekk tmur fuq it-tnejn, dak huwa pjuttost.
This is not difficult.	Dan mhux diffiċli.
Nothing he did, for what seemed like a long time.	Xejn ma għamel, għal dak li deher qisu żmien twil.
It wasn’t that truth.	Ma kinitx dik il-verità.
Early on.	Sa minn kmieni.
He will come back.	Hu ser jiġi lura.
If you don't, you won't.	Jekk ma jagħmilx hekk, inti mhux se.
All are from person to person.	Kollha huma minn persuna għal oħra.
You don't need anything else.	M'għandekx bżonn xi ħaġa oħra.
I have no money.	M'għandix flus.
It's like this.	Huwa bħal dan.
In fact, it is a big problem.	Fil-fatt, hija problema kbira.
It can be great.	Jista 'jkun kbir.
I can’t tell you anything else.	Ma nistax ngħidlek xi ħaġa oħra.
There are more than ever.	Hemm aktar minn qatt qabel.
He is a great man.	Huwa raġel kbir.
He was going to his room.	Kien imur fil-kamra tiegħu.
At that time I was a child.	Dak iż-żmien kont tifel.
I know they do.	Naf li jagħmlu.
It wasn't even noon.	Lanqas kien nofsinhar.
And I did it.	U għamilt dan.
But so it goes.	Imma hekk imur.
One knew why, of course.	Wieħed kien jaf għaliex, ovvjament.
It was him.	Kien hu.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
It had already appeared.	Kien diġà deher.
I can do either.	Jien nista' nagħmel jew.
I never had one.	Qatt ma kelli waħda.
No, that was not enough.	Le, dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
I will definitely do it again.	Żgur li se nerġa' nagħmel.
When do you want this?	Meta trid dan?
Much of something, you might say.	Ħafna minn xi ħaġa, tista 'tgħid.
I know you have.	Naf li għandek.
There is no way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod.
I already know who he is.	Diġà naf min hu.
We had a good time.	Kellna żmien tajjeb.
You just go.	Inti biss tmur.
I would be interested to think about it.	Inkun interessat li naħseb dwarha.
It was coming for him again.	Kien ġej għalih mill-ġdid.
There is no one here to see.	M'hemm ħadd hawn biex jara.
He said it would take too long.	Qal li se jieħu wisq ħin.
Why he did that, no one now knows.	Għaliex għamel hekk, ħadd issa ma jaf.
But here, here was something.	Imma hawn, hawn kien hemm xi ħaġa.
Or whatever.	Jew tkun xi tkun.
I have no idea how to do that.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif nagħmel dan.
But that was it.	Imma dak kien.
And a boy looked bad.	U tifel ħares ħażin.
You want to talk when you talk to him.	Trid titkellem meta titkellem miegħu.
It's a great idea.	Hija idea kbira.
He wants better.	Irid irid aħjar.
I never knew each other.	Qatt ma kont taf lil xulxin.
His work was done.	Ix-xogħol tiegħu sar.
But not good.	Imma mhux tajjeb.
Now you see.	Issa tara.
But there’s more to where that came from.	Imma hemm aktar minn fejn ġie dak.
I hope he wasn’t right about that.	Nispera li ma kellux raġun dwar dan.
Time on time.	Ħin fuq iż-żmien fuq il-ħin.
It was her.	Kienet hi.
You are saying something.	Qed tgħid xi ħaġa.
But this will not happen.	Imma dan mhux se jiġri.
On.	Fuq.
And this is a great thing.	U din hija ħaġa kbira.
I '.	I'.
It was on mine.	Kien fuq tiegħi.
I am very glad to say that now, we are.	Jien ferħan ħafna ngħid li issa, aħna.
My friend.	Ħabib tiegħi.
And no one knows why.	U ħadd ma jaf għaliex.
It was great to be there.	Kien kbir li tkun hemm.
That's how it should be.	Hekk kellu jkun.
More on the job than you know.	Aktar fuq ix-xogħol milli taf.
But it may be too late.	Imma jista’ jkun tard wisq.
She's scared of me.	Jibża minni.
I'm not out yet.	Għadni mhux barra.
Or maybe you are.	Jew forsi int.
He already has it for you.	Huwa diġà għandu għalik.
Something will happen tomorrow.	Xi ħaġa se jiġri għada.
Things like.	Affarijiet bħal .
If you do, this is for you.	Jekk tagħmel hekk, dan hu għalik.
We have no idea.	M'għandniex idea.
I was afraid of what was going to happen.	Kont nibża’ minn x’kien se jiġri.
No she is not.	Le hija le.
One never knows.	Wieħed qatt ma jaf.
That’s a great thing.	Dik hija ħaġa kbira.
I live there.	Jien noqgħod hemmhekk.
Not sure if that’s right or wrong.	Mhux ċert jekk dak hux tajjeb jew ħażin.
One really wants to.	Wieħed verament irid.
They are people usually.	Huma nies normalment.
If.	Kieku .
They were doing so, he knew.	Kienu jagħmlu hekk, kien jaf.
Don’t go it alone.	M'għandekx tmur waħdek.
I just have to think about it.	Ikolli biss naħseb dwarha.
I know it’s not.	Naf li mhix.
Like, everyone knows this.	Bħal, kulħadd jaf dan.
But if they do, it would be great.	Imma jekk jagħmlu dan, ikun kbir.
It is currently doing very well.	Bħalissa mar tajjeb ħafna.
It had been too long.	Kien għadda wisq żmien.
There was nothing.	Ma kien hemm xejn.
he said.	hu qal.
I could see he was trying hard.	Stajt nara li kien qed jipprova ħafna.
It wasn’t hard.	Ma kienx diffiċli.
Maybe ra, maybe not.	Forsi ra, forsi le.
It wasn't easy.	Ma kienx faċli.
He still didn't know why he asked.	Għadu ma kienx jaf għaliex staqsa.
It was hard to tell exactly what he was thinking.	Kien diffiċli li tgħid eżatt x’kien qed jaħseb.
She is not a nice person.	Hija mhix persuna sabiħa.
It was happening again.	Kien qed jerġa’ jiġri.
But now, no.	Imma issa, le.
It never will be.	Qatt mhu se jkun.
To me it is nothing.	Għalija mhu xejn.
I know he should.	Naf li għandu.
And whatever it is, everything will be fine.	U tkun xi tkun, kollox ikun tajjeb.
This took a long time.	Dan ħa ħafna ħin.
Try that a few times.	Ipprova li ftit drabi.
And it was coming fast.	U kien qed jasal malajr.
That's a chance.	Dak hemm ċans.
He never went back.	Qatt ma mar lura.
He will take you from there.	Huwa ser jieħu inti minn hemm.
I can't talk too much.	Ma nistax nitkellem wisq.
In fact, he did.	Fil-fatt hekk għamel.
I was expecting that.	Jien kont nistenna hekk.
It’s great for us.	Huwa kbir għalina.
That’s your only job.	Dak hu l-unika xogħol tiegħek.
It's just an idea now.	Huwa biss idea issa.
Of everyone and of no one, of everything and of nothing.	Ta’ kulħadd u ta’ ħadd, ta’ kollox u ta’ xejn.
One every year is too much.	Wieħed kull sena huwa wisq.
He knew it too.	Kien jaf ukoll.
And eating she does.	U tiekol hi tagħmel.
I can't even.	Jien lanqas biss nista.
He does everything he says he does.	Jagħmel dak kollu li jgħid li jagħmel.
I’m sure of it.	Jien ċert minn dan.
I want it to be.	Nixtieq li tiġi.
You are not well.	M'intix tajjeb.
In fact, you’re good.	Fil-fatt, int tajjeb.
That would have been good.	Dan kien ikun tajjeb.
I'm what he needs.	Jien dak li għandu bżonn.
I have done this too many times.	Dan għamilt wisq drabi.
He did things.	Huwa għamel l-affarijiet.
You have been.	Int ġejt.
I can talk to someone about something.	Nista’ nitkellem ma’ xi ħadd dwar xi ħaġa.
That is all.	Din hija għal kollox.
I really don’t need that.	Jien verament m'għandix bżonn dan.
Are you with me ?.	Int miegħi?.
I don't want to talk to you.	Ma rridx nitkellem miegħek.
He can't not.	Ma jistax ma.
Don't be late.	Tkunx tard.
It's too late for that now.	Huwa tard wisq għal dak issa.
It was good to be back.	Kien tajjeb li tkun lura.
He thought not.	Huwa ħaseb li le.
It’s not easy, of course.	Mhuwiex faċli, ovvjament.
I didn’t want one.	Ma ridtx waħda.
You never know enough.	Qatt ma tkun taf biżżejjed.
Not every time.	Mhux kull darba.
I think you need some time alone.	Naħseb li għandek bżonn ftit ħin waħdek.
He had done that.	Dan kien għamel.
Now and forever.	Issa u għal dejjem.
I didn’t do any of this alone.	Jien ma għamilt xejn minn dan waħdi.
I believe.	Jien nemmen.
I saw that.	Rajt dak.
He does not live.	Ma jgħix.
There was no time for more.	Ma kienx hemm ħin għal aktar.
That was it.	Dan kien hekk.
But nothing gave.	Imma xejn ma ta.
I expect this to be done.	Nistenna li dan isir.
I'm telling you so.	Qed ngħidlek hekk.
It may not be right for him.	Jista 'ma jkunx tajjeb għalih.
You know you want one.	Taf li trid waħda.
This is easy.	Dan huwa faċli.
But he never said much.	Imma qatt ma qal ħafna.
It was hard to see much outside.	Kien diffiċli li tara ħafna barra.
I can believe it.	Nista’ nemmen.
We will do that.	Aħna se nagħmlu dan.
I don't know anyone else who can, but maybe he can.	Ma naf lil ħadd ieħor li jista’, imma forsi jista’.
But maybe there is more.	Imma forsi hemm aktar.
You are not the first.	M'intix l-ewwel.
I came to tell you something.	Ġejt biex ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
This could not be.	Dan ma setax ikun.
He never does.	Hu qatt ma jagħmel.
As it was he didn’t really know if anything was actually happening.	Kif kien hu ma kienx verament jaf jekk fil-fatt kienx qed jiġri xi ħaġa.
Almost like there isn’t.	Kważi qisu ma jkunx hemm.
No, more than that.	Le, aktar minn hekk.
It should be ready by then.	Għandu jkun lest sa dak iż-żmien.
You can do that, too.	Tista 'tagħmel dan, ukoll.
I think you are right about that.	Naħseb li għandek raġun fuq dan.
That's not what's happening.	Li mhux dak li qed jiġri.
I’ve never been there before either.	Qatt ma kont hemm qabel lanqas.
There was nothing here, nothing.	Ma kien hemm xejn hawn, xejn.
But only a few.	Imma ftit biss.
That was my job.	Dak kien ix-xogħol tiegħi.
my do the same.	tiegħi jagħmlu l-istess.
I never knew what I was going to say.	Qatt ma kont naf x’se ngħid.
Well, nothing at the moment.	Ukoll, xejn bħalissa.
Someone was watching.	Xi ħadd kien qed jara.
I'm telling you now.	Jien ngħidlek issa.
All if that.	Kollha jekk dan.
No, it sure was him.	Le, żgur li kien hu.
I don't need to.	M'għandix bżonn.
I have a son at home.	Għandi tifel id-dar.
And this would happen often.	U dan kien jiġri spiss.
Now it's time to say goodbye.	Issa wasal iż-żmien li ngħid.
I know a man.	Naf raġel.
This seems to work well.	Dan jidher li jaħdem tajjeb.
He was trying, but he was here before.	Kien qed jipprova, imma kien hawn qabel.
I'm not so sure.	M'inix daqshekk ċert.
He was thinking of me more than ever.	Huwa kien jaħseb lili aktar minn qatt qabel.
This is unlikely here.	Dan mhux probabbli hawn.
Not with me, of course.	Mhux miegħi, ovvjament.
I can't do that.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan.
If you came once, you would be back.	Jekk ġejt darba, tkun lura.
You too.	Inti ukoll.
When he was ready, he was ready.	Meta kien lest, kien lest.
This could be.	Dan jista 'jkun.
So is yours.	Hekk ukoll tiegħek.
One man has a better chance.	Raġel wieħed għandu ċans aħjar.
That’s just the job.	Dak hu biss ix-xogħol.
I think it’s pretty much as it should be.	Naħseb li huwa pjuttost kif għandu jkun.
What would anyone want.	Dak li jkun irid xi ħadd.
It was probably there.	Probabbilment kien hemm.
It will help.	Se jgħin.
So was this.	Hekk kien ukoll dan.
There is.	Hemm.
So much easier.	Daqshekk aktar faċli.
It gets better from there.	Isir aħjar minn hemm.
I was very young.	Kont żgħir ħafna.
You will be telling me.	Int tkun qed tgħidli.
You don't have to do anything.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel xi ħaġa.
What it is, it is.	X'inhu, huwa.
It's one.	Huwa wieħed.
If not, you stay there.	Jekk le, inti toqgħod hemm.
She didn't know.	Hija ma kinitx taf.
He may have another.	Jista’ jkollu ieħor.
I would like to know.	Nixtieq inkun naf.
This is very good.	Dan huwa tajjeb ħafna.
But she always knew.	Imma dejjem kienet taf.
I think it will.	Naħseb li se.
But no one wanted to.	Imma ħadd ma ried.
He still does that.	Għadu jagħmel dan.
I was there.	Jien kont hemm.
You think you know what they are doing.	Taħseb li taf x'qed jagħmlu.
He was just a man.	Kien biss raġel.
Quite never.	Pjuttost qatt.
These and much more.	Dawn u ħafna aktar.
It was nothing.	Ma kien xejn.
But it was her.	Imma kienet hi.
He knows how to do so, so many things.	Jaf kif jagħmel hekk, tant affarijiet.
This may not be the case.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx.
There is nothing you can plan.	M'hemm xejn li tista' tippjana.
So he says.	Hekk jgħid.
In fact, it was.	Fil-fatt, kien.
That should be enough.	Li għandu jkun biżżejjed.
So it had to happen.	Hekk kellu jiġri.
I didn’t want what I thought.	Ma ridtx dak li ħsibt.
I do is my thing.	Nagħmel hija ħaġa tiegħi.
I can’t think of everyone.	Ma nistax naħseb għal kulħadd.
I didn’t want to go.	Ma ridtx immur.
It will be difficult for a long time.	Se jkun diffiċli għal żmien twil.
This could be.	Dan jista 'jkun.
That should not be there.	Dak m'għandux ikun hemm.
We’ve never had such a bad year.	Qatt ma kellna sena daqshekk ħażina.
Well, one thing really.	Ukoll, ħaġa waħda verament.
Where I was going.	Fejn kont sejjer.
It will be good.	Se jkun tajjeb.
Nobody knew what they were doing.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x’qed jagħmlu.
It hadn’t taken much to talk about.	Ma kienx ħa ħafna titkellem.
Just there is something else.	Biss hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
This has not been happening here for a long time.	Dan kien ilu ma jiġri hawn.
Maybe some things are just so.	Forsi xi affarijiet huma biss hekk.
He did a lot for me.	Huwa għamel ħafna għalija.
You can't see that.	Ma tistax tara dan.
You want something better.	Trid xi ħaġa aħjar.
This will take forever.	Dan se jieħu għal dejjem.
I can’t think of anything to say.	Ma nistax naħseb xi ħaġa li ngħid.
He was not coming back.	Ma kienx ġej lura.
I wanted that.	Jien kont nixtieq dan.
Was it really you?	Kien verament int?
I couldn’t do that.	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan.
I couldn’t tell.	Ma stajtx ngħid.
I knew it would be good.	Kont naf li se tkun tajba.
Time to go home.	Ħin biex tmur id-dar.
A friend like that did just that.	Ħabib bħal dan għamel hekk.
I know he did for me.	Naf li għamel għalija.
We went to school together.	Konna l-iskola flimkien.
Something very wrong.	Xi ħaġa ħażina ħafna.
I never thought there was so much, she says.	Qatt ma kont ħsibt li kien hemm daqshekk, tgħid.
I don’t know, anything more.	Ma nafx, xi ħaġa aktar.
I would be glad.	Inkun ferħan.
So it was.	Hekk kien hekk.
Neither do I.	Jien lanqas.
This is the first.	Din hija l-ewwel.
Nobody knows anything.	Ħadd ma jaf xejn.
It just so happens.	Dan jiġri biss hekk.
That was what he did.	Dak kien dak li għamel.
That was wrong.	Dan kien ħażin.
He needs money.	Jeħtieġ flus.
It was really happening.	Kien verament jiġri.
I already have money.	Diġà għandi flus.
Kellek.	Kellek.
Good enough to eat.	Tajjeb biżżejjed biex tiekol.
I don’t think anyone will.	Ma naħsibx li ħadd se.
Now it’s pretty bad.	Issa huwa pjuttost ħażin.
I don’t think she was ever beautiful.	Ma naħsibx li qatt kienet sabiħa.
He didn't do it.	Ma kienx jagħmel.
There are three problems here.	Hemm tliet problemi hawn.
This could not happen again.	Dan ma setax jerġa' jiġri.
But he wants to try.	Imma jrid jipprova.
I went to live with him.	Mort noqgħod miegħu.
I don’t want to go.	Ma rridx li tmur.
I’m not trying to do that.	Jien mhux qed nipprova nagħmel.
No one can say.	Ħadd ma jista’ jgħid.
He goes for whatever he wants.	Imur għal kull ma jrid.
And he came back.	U ġie lura.
There, you see.	Hemmhekk, tara.
The problem is that everyone had the same idea.	Il-problema hi li kulħadd kellu l-istess idea.
But he would have known.	Imma kieku kien jaf.
Just one more.	Wieħed biss aktar.
This may take a while, of course.	Dan jista 'jieħu ftit, ovvjament.
You will do well.	Inti se tagħmel tajjeb.
I was able to understand everything.	Kont kapaċi nifhem kollox.
Which is what is happening here.	Li huwa dak li qed jiġri hawn.
So we did.	Hekk għamilna.
That's about enough said.	Dak huwa dwar biżżejjed qal.
As you can see.	Kif tista 'tara .
She probably didn't.	Hija probabbilment ma.
It's still here.	Għadu hawn.
He says there will be work for me there.	Jgħid li se jkun hemm xogħol għalija hemmhekk.
You know, it's not a bad idea.	Taf, mhix idea ħażina.
It's one that.	Huwa wieħed li.
You are doing my job very hard.	Qed tagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi diffiċli ħafna.
He had thought about it more than he wanted to.	Kien ħaseb dwarha aktar milli ried.
But here we were.	Imma hawn konna.
It's nothing but.	Huwa xejn imma.
Someone was home.	Xi ħadd kien id-dar.
And you need something like that.	U għandek bżonn xi ħaġa bħal dik.
It was just one, you might say.	Kienet waħda biss, tista’ tgħid.
It was probably good.	Probabbilment kien tajjeb.
I have a lot.	Għandi ħafna.
I'm not even sure.	Jien lanqas ċert.
He was right, too.	Huwa kien raġun, ukoll.
I’ve never been able to do anything right.	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel xejn tajjeb.
It's about what he does.	Huwa dwar dak li jagħmel.
You need time to think.	Għandek bżonn ħin biex taħseb.
She was alone.	Kienet waħedha.
I can’t do this alone.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi.
She thought so too.	Kienet taħseb hekk ukoll.
But only if you want to.	Imma biss jekk tixtieq.
They are like everyone else.	Huma bħal kulħadd.
Someone like that.	Xi ħadd bħal dak.
I didn’t want to try anymore.	Ma ridtx nipprova aktar.
But it was ready for me.	Imma kien lest għalija.
She says it's hard to do.	Tgħid li diffiċli tagħmel.
I just did.	Għamilt biss.
Worth a try.	Ta’ min jipprova.
Not sure if much more.	Mhux ċert jekk ħafna aktar.
How nice to be late.	Kemm tkun sabiħa li tkun tard tard.
She loved it.	Hija iħobb dan.
Account account.	Kont kont.
I knew everything.	Kont naf kollox.
Now do everything together.	Issa jagħmlu kollox flimkien.
It could have been so much better.	Seta’ kien ħafna aħjar.
But we knew who knew.	Imma konna nafu min kien jaf.
It just first happened.	L-ewwel biss ġara.
There was nothing else he could do.	Ma kien hemm xejn ieħor li seta’ jagħmel.
He could not stand there without doing anything.	Ma setax joqgħod hemm mingħajr ma jagħmel xejn.
But he lost his home.	Imma tilef id-dar.
This is exactly how it should be.	Dan huwa eżatt kif għandu jkun.
Now that you are here you must stay.	Issa li qiegħed hawn trid toqgħod.
And so it is.	U hekk hu.
This is a great one.	Din hija waħda kbira.
I see.	Jiena nara.
And it never will be.	U qatt mhu se jkun.
I, too, have thought about this before.	Jien ukoll, ħsibt dwar dan qabel.
Very good.	Tajjeb ħafna.
But maybe you will.	Imma forsi inti se.
It's been a long time.	Kien ilu żmien twil.
She was very beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa ħafna.
Do this.	Tagħmel dan.
I think I saw it first.	Naħseb li rajt l-ewwel.
He said better not.	Qal li aħjar le.
The truth is not how you want it to be.	Il-verità mhix kif trid tkun.
I think it was just me.	Naħseb li kont jien biss.
I could talk.	Stajt nitkellem.
He couldn’t tell why he thought so.	Ma setax jgħid għaliex ħaseb hekk.
You just need a good teacher.	Għandek bżonn biss għalliem tajjeb.
So he said.	Hekk qal.
Maybe it was.	Forsi kien.
He didn’t want to do that.	Ma riedx jagħmel dan.
Not much time, but maybe enough.	Mhux ħafna ħin, imma forsi biżżejjed.
It’s too much, too much.	Huwa wisq, wisq.
I'm not here to be friends with anyone.	Jien m'iniex hawn biex inkun ħbieb ma' ħadd.
This works better.	Dan ix-xogħol aħjar.
I love this book.	Inħobb dan il-ktieb.
I will never say 'maybe'.	Qatt mhu ser ngħid ‘forsi’.
This is really bad.	Dan huwa tassew ħażin.
I don't think he could have lived like that either.	Naħseb li lanqas hu seta’ jgħix hekk.
That was it.	Kien dan.
I did a good job.	Għamilt xogħol tajjeb.
I don't know.	Jien ma nafx.
The problem may not be as bad as it seems.	Il-problema tista 'ma tkunx daqshekk ħażina kif tidher.
I know what you're going to say.	Naf x’se tgħid.
And it works for me.	U jaħdem għalija.
I knew what he was going to do.	Kont naf x’se tagħmel.
Really we are.	Tassew aħna.
He may have been here.	Seta’ kien hawn.
That would be really bad.	Dan ikun verament ħażin.
If it were really easy, everyone would be doing it.	Kieku kien tassew faċli, kulħadd ikun qed jagħmel dan.
He wanted what he wanted.	Ried dak li ried.
None of this is right.	Xejn minn dan mhu tajjeb.
But that should happen soon.	Imma dan għandu jiġri dalwaqt.
It was just like, there you go.	Kien biss bħal, hemm tmur.
There was little we could do about it now.	Kien hemm ftit li nistgħu nagħmlu dwar dan issa.
It is not enough.	Mhuwiex biżżejjed.
This seems to help a little.	Dan jidher li jgħin ftit.
It had been a while.	Kien ilu ftit.
I wanted to go there too.	Jien ridt immur hemm ukoll.
You'll know when you're ready.	Int tkun taf meta tkun lest.
And try he did.	U ipprova hu għamel.
The job done.	Ix-xogħol lest.
I was something great.	Jien kont xi ħaġa kbira.
I can’t go back home.	Ma nistax immur lura d-dar.
You did well.	Int għamilt tajjeb.
I can wait and see how it goes.	Nista’ nistenna u nara kif sejjer.
It will be good.	Se jkun tajjeb.
Okay, you.	Tajjeb, int.
There is nothing out there.	M'hemm xejn hawn barra.
So it must be.	Hekk għandu jkun.
But this is happening.	Imma dan qed jiġri.
That was the last.	Dik kienet l-aħħar.
He wanted to be a teacher someday.	Ried ikun għalliem xi darba.
I heard both.	Smajt it-tnejn.
They were all so.	Dawn kienu kollha hekk.
But it doesn't have to be.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun.
No, we can't do that.	Le, ma nistgħux nagħmlu hekk.
But sometimes that just happens.	Imma xi drabi dan jiġri biss.
She was doing it.	Hi kienet tagħmel dan.
Now it looks like it never was.	Issa qisu qatt ma kien hemm.
The timing had to be exact.	Il-ħin kellu jkun eżatt.
Like never enough.	Bħal qatt mhu biżżejjed.
In fact, it still does.	Fil-fatt, għadha tagħmel.
Nothing was what it seemed.	Xejn ma kien dak li deher.
You can say what you say, but you are what you are.	Tista’ tgħid dak li tgħid, imma int dak li int.
I heard all that.	Smajt dak kollu.
Not on something like that.	Mhux fuq xi ħaġa bħal din.
He never wanted anything so much.	Qatt ma ried xejn daqshekk.
But you’ve heard a lot.	Imma int smajt ħafna.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwar dan.
He died three years ago.	Miet tliet snin ilu.
He went that way.	Huwa mar mod hemmhekk.
It is working well.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb.
He had some problems when he started.	Huwa kellu xi problemi meta beda.
Maybe he already has one.	Forsi diġà għandu wieħed.
She also knows that everything is harder without a friend.	Hija taf ukoll li kollox huwa aktar diffiċli mingħajr ħabib.
But he had to do well.	Imma kellu jagħmel tajjeb ma’ dak li kellu.
My will not look like that.	Tiegħi mhux se jidher hekk.
She wants to see.	Hija trid li jara.
He should know that.	Huwa għandu jkun jaf li.
She would be eating now.	Kieku kienet tiekol issa.
I’m not sure that will happen.	M'inix ċert li se jiġri.
Nothing much to say.	Xejn ħafna xi ngħid.
I'm doing very well.	Jien sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
It’s very, very bad.	Huwa ħażin ħafna, ħafna.
No one had one.	Ħadd ma kellu wieħed.
This has never happened to me before.	Dan qatt ma ġara lili qabel.
If it weren’t already.	Kieku ma kinitx diġà.
This may take a while.	Dan jista' jieħu ftit.
No, that's enough!	Le, huwa biżżejjed!
Not too bad work.	Ix-xogħol mhux ħażin wisq.
That's what he's doing here.	Dak hu qed jagħmel hawn.
It will never be the same.	Qatt ma jkun l-istess.
It was.	Kien.
But so it happens.	Imma hekk jiġri.
Not me, of course.	Mhux jien, ovvjament.
He's just there.	Huwa biss qiegħed hemm.
He walked to the door.	Huwa telaq lejn il-bieb.
For hours and hours.	Għal sigħat u sigħat.
And that’s not what it is.	U dan mhux dak li hu.
I think you should come with me.	Naħseb li għandek tiġi miegħi.
Le le le.	Le le le.
He wants to go back.	Irid imur lura.
I don't think anyone can !.	Ma naħsibx li ħadd jista'!.
What if it's just.	X'hemm jekk huwa biss.
It's so much more.	Huwa ħafna aktar.
I want more.	Irrid aktar.
Many times, he wanted to be.	Ħafna drabi, ried ikun.
I can't go back.	Ma nistax immur lura.
Who did this to me.	Min għamel dan miegħi.
He knows what he's doing.	Jaf x’qed jagħmel.
He wasn’t waiting any longer.	Ma kienx qed jistenna aktar.
I know that, you know that.	Naf dan, taf dan.
And now I am.	U issa jien.
he said.	hu qal.
This does the job.	Dan jagħmel ix-xogħol.
I would be too.	Jien inkun ukoll.
He wasn’t too far behind.	Ma kienx wisq lura.
Whatever you want.	Xi inti tixtieq.
We will go home soon.	Se mmorru d-dar dalwaqt.
He is doing nothing.	Mhu qed jagħmel xejn.
It's the same.	Hija l-istess.
It can be seen as follows.	Jista 'jidher kif ġej.
I’m happy about that.	Jien kuntent dwar dan.
This is what you are all here to do.	Dan huwa dak li inti kollha hawn biex tagħmel.
But it keeps coming.	Imma jibqa’ ġej.
It was hard.	Kien diffiċli.
I will never do anything.	Qatt mhu se nagħmel xejn.
We will never know this.	Qatt ma nkunu nafu dan.
It's just not there.	Huwa biss mhux hemm.
You can see what's going on.	Tista’ tara x’kien qed jiġri.
I know where he went.	Naf fejn mar.
This was not to work.	Dan ma kellux jaħdem.
I still think about it.	Għadni naħseb dwarha.
That’s a great thing about here.	Dik hija ħaġa kbira madwar hawn.
Here's how he's playing.	Hawn kif qed jilgħab.
This may not be the case.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx hekk.
He knew where he was.	Kien jaf fejn kien.
as soon as possible now.	malajr kemm jista 'jkun issa.
He did well.	Huwa għamel tajjeb.
It looked like it was supposed to look like that.	Deher li suppost kellha tidher hekk.
Not anything else.	Mhux xi ħaġa oħra.
Glad to know you’re on to these things.	Ferħan li taf li int fuq dawn l-affarijiet.
Now more than ever.	Issa aktar minn qatt qabel.
Both will do a good job.	It-tnejn se jagħmlu xogħol tajjeb.
He lost once.	Huwa tilef darba.
Whatever she does.	Tkun xi tkun hi tagħmel.
I was never really at home.	Jien qatt ma kont verament id-dar.
He seems to have had very few friends, in fact.	Jidher li ma tantx kellu ħbieb, fil-fatt.
It would have been a problem.	Kienet tkun problema.
I'll tell you what to do.	Ngħidlek x’se nagħmlu.
She looked very beautiful.	Kienet tidher sabiħa ħafna.
I made this house for you.	Jien għamilt din id-dar għalik.
We just.	Aħna biss.
I understand where it comes from.	Nifhem minn fejn ġej.
But no one was saying anything.	Imma ħadd ma kien qed jgħid xejn.
You are great.	Inti kbir.
It's this time.	Huwa dan iż-żmien.
He will survive.	Hu ser jgħix.
No one told me how to do it.	Ħadd ma qalli kif nagħmel.
I didn’t have to.	Ma kellix għalfejn.
I didn’t believe it.	Ma kontx nemmen.
This could be a bad thing.	Din tista’ tkun xi ħaġa ħażina.
Nothing seemed to have happened.	Ma kien jidher li ġara xejn.
No one can be sure.	Ħadd ma jista’ jkun ċert.
We know each other.	Nafu lil xulxin.
Not here, of course.	Mhux hawn, ovvjament.
You are doing this.	Dan qed tagħmel.
It would be very difficult.	Ikun diffiċli ħafna.
I wish everyone around here had a little bit of this.	Nixtieq li kulħadd hawn madwar kellu ftit minn dan.
Everything was.	Kollox kien.
Long enough for both of us.	Twil biżżejjed għalina t-tnejn.
How many of these things are there?	Kemm hemm minn dawn l-affarijiet?
He needed a job.	Huwa kellu bżonn xogħol.
It really is.	Huwa tassew.
He came and went.	Ġie u mar.
Everyone was tired.	Kulħadd kien għajjien.
Looks like you're doing something.	Qisu qed tagħmel xi ħaġa.
But it was, and will be.	Imma kien, u se jkun.
In fact, you can do it now.	Fil-fatt, tista 'tagħmel dan issa.
I did nothing.	Jien ma għamilt xejn.
And this we need.	U dan għandna bżonn.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.	Xejn bħal dan qatt ma ġara qabel.
We don't have that many people there.	M'għandniex daqshekk nies hemmhekk.
I understand the timing.	Nifhem iż-żmien.
He lost his job, and he had to.	Huwa tilef ix-xogħol tiegħu, u kellu.
Maybe it would.	Forsi kieku.
It wasn’t the first time.	Ma kinitx l-ewwel darba.
I didn’t want to know if he could do that.	Ma ridtx inkun naf jekk jistax jagħmel hekk.
Anyone who knows something like this knows.	Kull min jaf xi ħaġa hekk jaf.
You haven’t heard anything yet.	Għadek ma smajt xejn.
Or talk about it.	Jew titkellem dwarha.
I need to do another one.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel ieħor.
This is where we are.	Dan huwa fejn aħna.
That never happened.	Dak qatt ma ġara.
You'll know better than me.	Int tkun taf aħjar minni.
You can't do this at home.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan id-dar.
That's good.	Dan tajjeb.
I wonder what he is thinking.	Nistaqsi x’qed jaħseb.
And he has too much money.	U hu għandu wisq flus.
It's getting late.	Qed isir tard.
And that’s fun.	U dak hu gost.
Come here.	Ejja hawn.
Well there was that too.	Ukoll kien hemm dan ukoll.
But you want more.	Imma trid aktar.
There is nothing left.	Ma jibqa’ xejn.
Just a man.	Biss raġel.
He went home.	Huwa mar id-dar.
As far as I know, this has never happened.	Sa fejn naf jien, dan qatt ma ġara.
He was a good man, and he was my friend.	Kien raġel tajjeb, u kien ħabib tiegħi.
I know he’s still working to take everything.	Naf li għadu qed jaħdem biex jieħu kollox.
But we can do something about it.	Imma nistgħu nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwarha.
Well, not today.	Ukoll, mhux illum.
It's not here properly.	Huwa mhux hawn kif suppost.
He doesn’t have to do anything else.	M'għandux għalfejn jagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
I have never thought about this before.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan qabel.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kinitx.
He looked tired.	Huwa deher għajjien.
This is very difficult for me.	Dan huwa diffiċli ħafna għalija.
I said for sure, when.	Għidt żgur, meta.
He can't have that.	Ma jistax ikollu dak.
But she didn't do it.	Imma hi ma kinitx tagħmel dan.
It was great.	Kien kbir.
And now this.	U issa dan.
Not that you know that.	Mhux li tkun taf li.
He was expecting this.	Huwa kien jistenna dan.
He hadn't said anything to anyone.	Ma kien qal xejn lil ħadd.
It will be time soon.	Ikun dalwaqt iż-żmien.
They were not very easy.	Ma tantx kienu faċli.
No one was from.	Ħadd ma kien minn.
She knew what she was thinking.	Kienet taf x’kien qed jaħseb.
You don't know why you're here.	Ma taf xejn għaliex qiegħed hawn.
As well as it should.	Kif ukoll għandu.
If this is what you want.	Jekk dan huwa dak li trid.
She was not seated.	Ma kinitx bilqiegħda.
Try it.	Ipprova.
I need help so.	Ikolli bżonn hekk għajnuna.
There was no other person to be seen.	Ma kienx hemm persuna oħra li tidher.
I wonder how that was.	Nistaqsi kif kien dan.
I can't wait.	Ma nistax nistenna.
It could be here too.	Jista’ jkun hawn ukoll.
I still want one.	Għadni nixtieq wieħed.
And you have to do it the first time.	U trid tagħmel dan l-ewwel darba.
But good with me.	Imma tajjeb miegħi.
Good to be back.	Tajjeb li tkun lura.
One of many.	Wieħed minn ħafna.
It could have been otherwise.	Seta’ kien mod ieħor.
Ask him out well if he is no longer absorbed in the connection.	Staqsa x’kien se jagħmel issa.
He was alone.	Huwa kien biss.
I want a man to do something like that for me.	Nixtieq li raġel jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik għalija.
It was coming tonight.	Kien ġej illejla.
Everyone will wait.	Kulħadd se jistenna.
I have to think about that.	Għandi naħseb dwar dan.
This is not a good thing.	Din mhix xi ħaġa tajba.
We just did.	Għamilna biss.
It was me.	Jien kont jien.
That first time, and often after.	Dik l-ewwel darba, u ħafna drabi wara.
How does this work?	Kif jaħdem dan?
It just happened.	Ġara biss.
I hope this helps someone.	Nispera li dan jgħin lil xi ħadd.
It seems easy enough from the outside.	Jidher faċli biżżejjed minn barra.
I will definitely do this again and eat these.	Żgur li se nerġa' nagħmel u niekol dawn.
This makes it much easier today.	Dan jagħmel illum ħafna aktar faċli.
No one goes that far.	Ħadd ma jmur daqshekk.
I still don’t know much about it.	Għadni ma nafx ħafna dwarha.
I can't have this.	Ma nistax ikolli dan.
Can't say when.	Ma jistax jgħid meta.
On many things he said no.	Fuq ħafna affarijiet qal le.
Why would.	Għaliex kieku.
And bad for everyone.	U ħażin għal kulħadd.
Like, last.	Bħal, l-aħħar.
But not what you think it is.	Imma mhux dak li taħseb li hu.
I didn’t want to be alone.	Ma ridtx li tkun waħedha.
That's what happened.	Hekk ġara.
It could be where they are from.	Jista 'jkun minn fejn huma.
Most likely will.	Ħafna probabbli se.
I thought he could play.	Ħsibt li jista’ jilgħab.
We don’t need more money.	M'għandniex bżonn aktar flus.
I see what can’t be there.	Nara dak li ma jistax ikun hemm.
This is a little too much.	Dan huwa ftit wisq.
You know.	Taf.
I'm something else.	Jien xi ħaġa oħra.
She was good to me.	Kienet tajba miegħi.
It was so bad.	Kien daqshekk ħażin.
You'll think of something.	Int ser taħseb xi ħaġa.
Never, ever will I be without your book.	Qatt, qatt mhu se nkun mingħajr il-ktieb tiegħek.
Sorry for nothing.	Jiddispjaċini għal xejn.
There are things you can’t do, be as much as you want.	Hemm affarijiet li ma tistax tagħmel, tkun kemm trid.
This is everyone.	Dan huwa kulħadd.
No, she doesn't.	Le, hi ma.
He said nothing of what he had seen.	Ma qal xejn minn dak li kien ra.
He’s not a bad boy.	Mhuwiex tifel ħażin.
But it was too bad of me.	Imma kien ħażin wisq minni.
Nothing bad ever happened.	Qatt ma ġara xejn ħażin.
It makes my job a lot easier. 	Jagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi ħafna aktar faċli. 
meta.	meta.
There wanted to be more.	Ried ikun hemm aktar.
I made your time, as it were.	Għamilt il-ħin tiegħek, kif kien.
You could say it's not great.	Tista 'tgħid li mhux kbir.
She was doing something for you.	Hi kienet tagħmel xi ħaġa għalik.
It can't be that way.	Ma jistax ikun hekk.
I can't say when.	Ma nistax ngħid meta.
But even that wasn’t all of it.	Imma lanqas dan ma kienx kollu kemm hu.
But that’s what it is.	Imma huwa dak li hu.
It may or may not be true.	Jista’ jkun il-verità jew le.
And that was easy money.	U dak kien flus faċli.
It won’t go back to where it was before, either.	Mhux se jmur lura fejn kien qabel, lanqas.
I could wait until tomorrow.	Stajt nistenna sa għada.
It is still working.	Għadu qed jaħdem.
It has been around.	Ġie madwar.
This happens every year.	Dan jiġri kull sena.
It can take.	Jista 'jieħu.
Maybe it was so.	Forsi kien hekk.
I'm just saying he.	Jien biss ngħid hu.
I know there's a chance for that.	Naf li hemm ċans ta’ dan.
She was alone.	Kienet waħedha.
He knew they were.	Kien jaf li kienu.
I have never seen anything like this before.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din qabel.
We just want to.	Irridu biss.
If you wanted.	Jekk ridt.
And something is better than nothing.	U xi ħaġa hija aħjar minn xejn.
It will never be again.	Qatt mhu se jerġa’ jkun.
I’m glad he did.	Jien ferħan li għamel.
He knows he could never win.	Jaf li qatt ma seta’ jirbaħ.
i needed.	kelli bżonn.
I can't do anything.	Jien ma nista nagħmel xejn.
It looks good.	Huwa jidher tajjeb.
And that was definitely going to be a problem.	U li żgur kienet se tkun problema.
It should not.	M'għandux.
I always said so.	Dejjem għedt hekk.
I'm just surprised.	Jien biss sorpriż.
That was as far as he could go, he said.	Dan kien sa fejn imur, qal.
But there is nothing you can do about it.	Imma m'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
But it wasn’t there.	Imma ma kienx hemm.
That was years and years ago.	Dan kien snin u snin ilu.
Also, not so late.	Barra minn hekk, mhux daqshekk tard.
But no one appears.	Imma ħadd ma jidher.
Where have we been?	Fejn konna?
He knew what to expect now.	Kien jaf x’se jistenna issa.
I heard nothing about it.	Smajt xejn dwar dan.
Not so long ago.	Mhux daqshekk twil ilu.
There can be no better time than now.	Ma jistax ikun hemm żmien aħjar minn issa.
She had never been so beautiful before.	Qatt ma kienet daqshekk sabiħa qabel.
I already have enough money.	Diġà għandi biżżejjed flus.
Everything went very well.	Kollox mar tajjeb ħafna.
I wasn’t able to do that.	Jien ma kontx kapaċi nagħmel dan.
They are many.	Huma ħafna.
I spent some time there.	Għamilt xi żmien hemm.
Either you go get some help either.	Jew tmur tieħu xi għajnuna jew.
It is now or never.	Huwa issa jew qatt.
I was dating someone else at the time.	Dak iż-żmien kont sejjer ma’ xi ħadd ieħor.
It should help a lot.	Għandu jgħin ħafna.
That's out later.	Dak hu barra wara.
I’m not just talking.	Jien ma nitkellem biss.
No one is there.	Ħadd mhu hemm.
I'm dead.	Jien mort.
It is being done.	Qed isir.
Here it comes.	Hawn ġej.
He's just trying to help.	Huwa biss jipprova jgħin.
Or here.	Jew hawn.
Or so he thinks.	Jew hekk jaħseb hu.
I’m just out of everything.	Jien biss barra minn kollox.
I had enough.	Kelli biżżejjed.
Tell me.	Qalli.
It's not hard.	Mhuwiex diffiċli.
He didn’t know anyone there.	Ma kien jaf lil ħadd hemmhekk.
I want you to come with me.	Irrid li tiġi miegħi.
It could be his.	Jista’ jkun tiegħu.
And there was something.	U kien hemm xi ħaġa.
I need to say.	Għandi bżonn ngħid.
I would never do such a thing.	Jien qatt ma nagħmel ħaġa bħal din.
That will be something great.	Dik se tkun xi ħaġa kbira.
He died first.	L-ewwel miet.
He wasn’t, of course.	Huwa ma kienx, ovvjament.
When this happens.	Meta jiġri dan.
Whatever it is.	Ikun xi jkun dan.
Someone has to do it.	Xi ħadd irid jagħmel dan.
I’m going to have a good time.	Jien ser nieħu ħin tajjeb.
He said nothing.	Ma qal xejn.
It seems to be working now.	Jidher li qed jaħdem issa.
I don't know when.	Ma nafx meta.
I think he’s there.	Naħseb li qiegħed hemm.
She was never back.	Hija qatt ma kienet lura.
Something I have never done before.	Xi ħaġa li qatt ma għamilt qabel.
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
I don't want to.	Ma rridx.
Sure, he didn’t have one.	Żgur, ma kellux wieħed.
It is still working.	Għadu qed jaħdem.
To do this quickly was.	Li tagħmel dan malajr kien.
I was a small child.	Jien kont tifel żgħir.
And I know a lot about it.	U naf ħafna dwarha.
I heard him say so	Smajt jgħid hekk
Same for everyone, really.	L-istess għal kulħadd, tassew.
He did not know how he got there.	Ma kienx jaf kif wasal hemm.
He only spoke when he wanted to.	Kien jitkellem biss meta jrid.
And after that, that was for me.	U wara dan, dak kien għalija.
And I saw what happened to it.	U rajt x’ġara b’dan.
I understand that.	Nifhem li.
I have to tell you something.	Għandi ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
I was scared sometimes.	Kont nibża’ xi drabi.
I came here alone.	Ġejt hawn waħdi.
It has been there for years.	Ilu hemm għal snin.
It was great.	Kienet kbira.
Sure enough, he did.	Żgur biżżejjed, hekk għamel.
I knew she had to.	Kont naf li kellha.
Why would he do such a thing.	Għaliex kien jagħmel ħaġa bħal din.
I understand that it can work.	Jiena nifhem li jista' jaħdem.
Work either done or not.	Ix-xogħol jew sar jew le.
It was a very bad time for me.	Kien żmien ħażin ħafna għalija.
I can't say that.	Ma nistax ngħid hekk.
Shortly after that.	Ftit wara dak.
I see that now.	Nara li issa.
I see nothing more.	Jien ma nara xejn aktar.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan.
Just more.	Biss aktar.
For a long time nothing happened.	Għal żmien twil ma ġara xejn.
I knew it would come.	Kont naf li se jiġi.
That was a while ago.	Dak kien ftit ilu.
But enough of me.	Imma biżżejjed minni.
I’m coming whether you like it or not.	Jien ġej jekk tixtieq jew le.
If she left now, she would be alone.	Jekk telaq issa, hi tkun waħedha.
Just soon, please.	Biss dalwaqt, jekk jogħġbok.
I said it wasn’t over.	Jien għedt li ma kienx aktar.
You can't stay here.	Ma tistax toqgħod hawn.
I’m not sure how I do that.	M'inix ċert kif nagħmel dan.
To a man.	Lil raġel.
We are sure.	Aħna żgur.
The work is busy here.	Ix-xogħol huwa okkupat hawn.
He saw nothing wrong.	Ma ra xejn ħażin.
Tom is working hard.	Tom qed jaħdem ħafna.
All you can do is say or do something nice.	Kull ma tista’ tagħmel hu li tgħid jew tagħmel xi ħaġa sabiħa.
It looks bad.	Jidher ħażin.
At that time he was alone in the room.	Dak il-ħin kien waħdu fil-kamra.
You said so.	Inti għidt hekk.
I'm small.	Jien żgħir.
It's so good.	Huwa hekk tajjeb.
You don't want to be there.	Ma tkunx trid tkun hemm.
It had only been going on for as long as it could.	Kien ilu jiġri biss kemm seta’.
He should be home by now.	Huwa għandu jkun id-dar sa issa.
You are thinking.	Qed taħseb.
I thought it was a great idea.	Ħsibt li kienet idea kbira.
I believe you are right.	Nemmen li għandek raġun.
Time passed quickly.	Iż-żmien għadda malajr.
Let’s now, say that’s what it is.	Ejja issa, għid li huwa dak li hu.
It’s too much for anyone.	Huwa wisq għal xi ħadd.
And she looks good.	U hi tidher tajba.
You never come here.	Inti qatt ma tiġi hawn.
Which is usually.	Li hu normalment.
There will be a lot of people there.	Se jkun hemm ħafna nies hemmhekk.
I wonder where it came from.	Nistaqsi minn fejn ġie.
I would never do something like that again.	Qatt ma nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik mill-ġdid.
Obviously you know.	Ovvjament taf.
It was too much for one.	Kien wisq għal wieħed.
Now that never happens.	Issa dan qatt ma jiġri.
It was pretty much what he did.	Kien pjuttost dak li għamel.
He will live on.	Huwa se jgħix fuq.
Only once again.	Għal darba oħra biss.
In fact they do, all the time.	Fil-fatt hekk jagħmlu, il-ħin kollu.
And maybe that was it.	U forsi hekk kien.
As he is.	Kif hu.
He is your friend.	Huwa ħabib tiegħek.
One that is not beautiful.	Waħda li mhix sabiħa.
The only way.	L-uniku mod.
That was it.	Kien dak.
We certainly don't.	Aħna żgur li ma.
It’s more than a car.	Huwa aktar minn karozza.
Maybe there was something to that.	Forsi kien hemm xi ħaġa għal dak.
Not a hard one to see.	Mhix waħda diffiċli biex tara.
He couldn't do more.	Ma setax jagħmel aktar.
Great job or bad job ?.	Xogħol kbir jew xogħol ħażin?.
He didn’t want to have to think more about such things.	Ma riedx ikollu jaħseb aktar dwar affarijiet bħal dawn.
I think you know where this is going.	Naħseb li taf fejn sejjer dan.
It was really really hard.	Kien verament verament diffiċli.
I was very.	Kont ħafna.
This happens.	Dan jiġri.
I'm really not.	Jien verament mhux.
I did more than that.	Għamilt aktar minn hekk.
I love school.	Inħobb l-iskola.
One could never be sure.	Wieħed qatt ma seta’ jkun ċert miegħu.
After that, he was alone.	Wara dan, kien waħdu.
I'm not there yet.	Għadni mhux hemm.
Or, often, both.	Jew, ħafna drabi, it-tnejn.
Other than that great.	Barra minn dak kbir.
He was getting there.	Kien jasal hemm.
Come to me.	Jiġi għandi.
It could happen again.	Jista’ jerġa’ jiġri.
Man, that would be great.	Raġel, li jkun tajjeb ħafna.
But you can’t go back.	Imma ma tistax tmur lura.
More than she wants.	Aktar milli trid hi.
I want to.	Irrid.
Everyone had.	Kulħadd kellu.
We are just too.	Aħna biss wisq.
It happened a long time ago.	Ġara twil ilu.
I was at home.	Kont id-dar.
That was your job.	Dak kien ix-xogħol tiegħek.
I will make some money for you.	Jiena nagħmel xi flus għalik.
You are tired.	Inti għajjien.
And so I did.	U hekk għamilt.
If it were.	Kieku kien.
But he didn't know everything.	Imma ma kienx jaf kollox.
Never say so.	Qatt tgħid hekk.
Maybe she should.	Forsi kellha.
And, it looks like they're doing it again.	U, jidher li qed jagħmlu dan mill-ġdid.
he said.	hu qal.
Too late for that now.	Tard wisq għal dak issa.
But maybe not for long.	Imma forsi mhux għal żmien twil.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Kollox deher sejjer tajjeb.
There were problems.	Kien hemm problemi.
It wasn’t quite a year.	Huwa ma kienx pjuttost sena.
Only this week !.	Din il-ġimgħa biss!.
I don't want to know.	Ma rridx inkun naf.
So great you are.	Hekk kbir int.
So I did.	Hekk għamilt.
But here's the problem.	Imma hawn problemi.
All of the above are good.	Kollha ta 'hawn fuq huma tajba.
Well, that won't work.	Ukoll, dak mhux se jaħdem.
He needs that where he is going.	Ikollu bżonn dak fejn sejjer.
That's how they felt.	Hekk ħassu.
He would never do such a thing.	Hu qatt ma kien jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din.
I'm still not sure how.	Għadni mhux ċert kif.
After that, he left.	Wara dan, telaq.
I just couldn't do it.	I biss ma stajtx tagħmel dan.
There is no right or wrong way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod tajjeb jew ħażin.
It can do that.	Dan jista 'jagħmel dan.
It didn't take long.	Ma kienx jieħu ħafna.
Maybe that was good.	Forsi li kien tajjeb.
I'm out of here.	Jien barra minn hawn.
He always says so.	Dejjem jgħid hekk.
It's so again.	Huwa hekk mill-ġdid.
He probably wanted something better for you than he had.	Probabbilment ried xi ħaġa aħjar għalik milli kellu.
It's pretty good.	Huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
You are not a beautiful person.	M'intix persuna sabiħa.
I saw this.	Rajt dan.
Not that he ever did, but he did.	Mhux li qatt kellu, imma hekk għamel.
Now it’s time to ask a few questions.	Issa wasal iż-żmien li nistaqsi ftit.
And she didn’t know why.	U ma kinitx taf għaliex.
I didn’t think it would be so.	Ma kontx naħseb li se jkun hekk.
It's just that we are.	Huwa biss li aħna.
No, really, they do.	Le, tassew, jagħmlu.
He did just as well.	Huwa kif ukoll għamel.
I'm sorry.	Jiddispjaċini.
He wants to be fast.	Ikun irid ikun malajr.
You are not friends.	M'intix ħbieb.
I'm trying.	Qed nipprova.
Sure, everything can be fine.	Żgur, kollox jista 'jkun tajjeb.
I love these things.	Inħobb dawn l-affarijiet.
I was so busy at work today.	Jien kont tant okkupat fuq ix-xogħol illum.
It was still good.	Kien għadu tajjeb.
You had a good idea there a few years ago.	Kellek idea tajba hemm ftit snin ilu.
A good man could do the same.	Raġel tajjeb seta’ għamel l-istess.
Until recently,	Sa ftit ilu,
People you don’t really know.	Nies li ma tantx taf.
It’s my last year.	Hija l-aħħar sena tiegħi.
I did nothing wrong.	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin.
Maybe for hours.	Forsi għal sigħat.
We did.	Għamilna.
She wasn’t there, of course.	Hija ma kinitx hemm, ovvjament.
You said this could not happen.	Inti għedt li dan ma setax jiġri.
No, it can happen to anyone.	Le, jista' jiġri lil kulħadd.
Good for you.	Tajjeb għalik.
No one else lives.	Ħadd ieħor ma jgħix.
But of course, she wouldn’t be there.	Imma ovvjament, hi ma tkunx hemm.
It was late, he knew.	Kien tard, kien jaf.
It seems you can’t do that anymore.	Jidher li ma tistax tagħmel dan aktar.
It’s not as easy as you think.	Mhuwiex faċli kif taħseb.
Apparently he couldn't wait any longer.	Milli jidher ma setax jistenna aktar.
And besides, this was my friend.	U barra minn hekk, dan kien ħabib tiegħi.
He just went to do it.	Huwa biss mar jagħmel dan.
Come to me.	Jiġi għandi.
There are many things to see.	Hemm ħafna affarijiet x'tara.
I was here.	Jien kont hawn.
It seems to be working.	Jidher li qed jaħdem.
There is something we can do.	Jista’ jkun hemm xi ħaġa li nistgħu nagħmlu.
The work was great too.	Ix-xogħol kien kbir ukoll.
That would be better.	Li jkun aħjar.
And he said so.	U qal hekk.
I am now, and it is very helpful.	Jien issa, u hija ta’ għajnuna kbira.
Like I said, it’s late.	Kif għedt, huwa tard.
I couldn't tell who it was.	Ma stajtx ngħid min kien.
You need to know.	Jeħtieġ li tkun taf.
I have a car.	Għandi karozza.
And good too.	U tajjeb ukoll.
He wanted to know what was going on.	Ried ikun jaf x’qed jiġri.
I want to be alone, today.	Irrid inkun waħdi, illum.
You want to be better.	Trid tkun aħjar.
Who can do what you want with this.	Minn tista 'tagħmel dak li trid b'dan.
It was a good fit.	Kien tajjeb tajjeb.
It could be anyone.	Jista’ jkun xi ħadd.
Too many things.	Wisq affarijiet.
Tomorrow will be great.	Għada se jkun kbir.
There was no one to see.	Ma kien hemm min jidher.
And it does it better.	U jagħmel dan aħjar.
We are having a good time.	Qed nagħmlu ħin tajjeb.
A great idea is a great idea.	Idea kbira hija idea kbira.
Or someone you know.	Jew xi ħadd li taf.
It's probably almost nothing.	Huwa probabbilment kważi xejn.
If so, it would be too bad.	Jekk jiġri hekk, ikun ħażin wisq.
Why didn’t he do that.	Għaliex ma kienx jagħmel dan.
I don’t think it ever will.	Ma naħsibx li qatt se.
It definitely works around here.	Huwa żgur jaħdem madwar hawn.
Well, not always.	Ukoll, mhux dejjem.
It wasn’t easy for me.	Ma kinitx faċli għalija.
This is not.	Din mhix.
How long will it take to do it otherwise.	Kemm se tieħu ħin biex tagħmel dan mod ieħor.
This was one.	Din kienet waħda.
I don't know why.	Ma nafx għaliex.
It was time for someone to know.	Kien wasal iż-żmien li xi ħadd ikun jaf.
No one else was there at the time.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien hemm dak iż-żmien.
But we know why.	Imma nafu għaliex.
But he obviously didn’t do that.	Imma ovvjament ma kienx jagħmel hekk.
That's not bad.	Dak mhux ħażin.
He knew why he was doing this.	Kien jaf għaliex kien qed jagħmel dan.
I am telling the truth.	Qed ngħid il-verità.
Hardly anyone knew the truth.	Kważi ħadd kien jaf il-verità.
The faster you come, the better for us.	Aktar ma tiġi malajr, aħjar għalina.
Not as far as we know.	Mhux sa fejn nafu aħna.
He did well.	Huwa għamel tajjeb.
It's three o'clock.	Huwa tliet sigħat.
He left about the same time we did.	Huwa telaq madwar l-istess ħin li għamilna aħna.
I’ve seen this before.	Rajt dan qabel.
It comes from behind.	Jiġi minn wara.
It should fit.	Għandu joqgħod.
My house was not big enough.	Id-dar tiegħi ma kinitx kbira biżżejjed.
You will not have heard this.	Mhux se tkun smajt dan.
I know you can't.	Naf li ma tistax.
You must.	Inti trid.
So and so.	Hekk u hekk.
Not that I don’t want to, I do.	Mhux li ma rridx, jien.
I'll be back soon.	Ser inkun lura dalwaqt.
You have thought about this before.	Għandek ħsibt dwar dan qabel.
She didn't know why she had to say anything.	Ma kinitx taf għaliex kellha tgħid xejn.
Come to this.	Wasal għal dan.
I would like to know.	Nixtieq inkun naf.
And she had to tell someone.	U kellha tgħid lil xi ħadd.
How long have you been.	Kemm int twil.
It's very easy.	Huwa faċli ħafna.
You alone.	Int biss.
There he would sit for hours at a time.	Hemm kien joqgħod għal sigħat kull darba.
Maybe it was a good idea to tell someone about it.	Forsi kienet idea tajba li tgħid lil xi ħadd dwarha.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
I just did something wrong.	Għamilt xi ħaġa ħażina biss.
That is not the truth.	Dik mhix il-verità.
It was so big for me.	Kien daqshekk kbir għalija.
What do you want to eat today?	Xi trid tiekol illum?
This is just the same.	Dan huwa biss l-istess.
I did something.	Għamilt xi ħaġa.
I had to eat.	Kelli niekol.
On and on.	Fuq u fuq.
I’m glad you came.	Jien ferħan li ġejt.
That’s a lot harder to do.	Dak huwa ħafna aktar diffiċli biex tagħmel.
It was very easy.	Kien faċli ħafna.
This will not work.	Dan mhux se jaħdem.
We just.	Aħna biss.
He loved the book.	Huwa kien iħobb il-ktieb.
There was so much.	Kien hemm tant.
That's not good.	Dak mhux tajjeb.
That was it.	Kien dak.
Someday, not today.	Xi darba, mhux illum.
He wanted to do everything.	Ried jagħmel kollox.
He knows how.	Jaf kif.
Nothing is easy.	Xejn mhu faċli.
The dog died.	Il-kelb miet.
He has been waiting since morning.	Ilu jistenna minn filgħodu.
They were here for hours.	Kienu hawn għal sigħat.
But it is more than that.	Imma huwa aktar minn hekk.
I’m having fun now.	Jien nieħu gost issa.
I was just glad.	Kont ferħan biss.
You must go, my friend.	Trid tmur, ħabib tiegħi.
He actually tried.	Huwa fil-fatt ipprova.
I didn’t know why it was happening.	Ma kontx naf għaliex kien qed jiġri.
No one knew where he lived.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn jgħix.
That's so much.	Dak hekk ħafna.
That was wrong.	Dan kien ħażin.
But not too big either.	Imma lanqas kbir wisq.
We really can’t.	Aħna verament ma nistgħux.
You will do this with these.	Inti se tagħmel dan ma 'dawn.
Maybe someone had died.	Forsi xi ħadd kien miet.
It was definitely happening.	Żgur li kien qed jiġri.
To say nothing.	Biex ma tgħid xejn.
Maybe she does.	Forsi hi tagħmel.
Time to go.	Ħin biex tmur.
That is for sure.	Dan huwa ċert.
Until recently.	Sa ftit ilu.
It just doesn't happen.	Huwa biss ma jiġri.
It shouldn’t happen.	M'għandux jiġri.
It probably was.	Probabbilment kienet.
It doesn’t have to be harder than that.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun aktar diffiċli minn hekk.
They were just both of them.	Kienu biss it-tnejn li huma.
Probably will.	Probabbilment se.
I wasn’t the same, neither was she.	Jien ma kontx l-istess, lanqas hi.
And what is this? 	U dan x'inhu?
he asked.	staqsa.
I hope you like it.	Nispera li inti tixtieq.
I said before.	għidt qabel.
I think this is a great idea.	Naħseb li din hija idea kbira.
I don't even know how.	Lanqas naf kif.
I will only listen.	Jien biss se nisma.
But, of course, you’re so small.	Imma, ovvjament, int daqshekk żgħir.
It never does.	Dan qatt ma jagħmel.
That was the whole problem.	Dik kienet il-problema kollha.
I don’t think anyone should.	Ma naħsibx li ħadd għandu.
It must remain so.	Irid jibqa' hekk.
It really is.	Huwa tassew.
More than bad.	Aktar milli ħażin.
Neither is he.	Hu lanqas.
All right, really.	Kollox tajjeb, tassew.
This was mine.	Dan kien tiegħi.
I don't want to go home.	Ma rridx immur id-dar.
It's too much.	Huwa wisq.
You know that.	Taf li.
This happens to everyone.	Dan jiġri lil kulħadd.
One never knows.	Wieħed qatt ma jaf.
he asked.	staqsa.
And it was great.	U kienet kbira.
I was at work.	Kont fuq ix-xogħol.
Better to be alone.	Aħjar li jibqa’ waħdu.
He's supposed to be back home.	Suppost jerġa’ lura d-dar.
It was definitely not easy.	Żgur li ma kienx faċli.
But that next week.	Imma dak il-ġimgħa d-dieħla.
He said it was a really good idea.	Qal li din kienet idea tassew tajba.
During the day he cannot eat.	Bi nhar ma jistax jiekol.
But it looked good too.	Imma deher tajjeb ukoll.
But you just stay there.	Imma int biss toqgħod hemm.
It works well, it only takes a long time.	Jaħdem tajjeb, jieħu biss żmien twil.
To know a little.	Biex tkun taf ftit.
I'm going.	Jien se mmur.
How long has that been.	Kemm kien ilu dak.
Well, it was too much for me.	Ukoll, kien wisq għalija.
It goes that way.	Imur hekk.
This is what will happen.	Dan huwa dak li se jiġri.
This is your last chance, my son.	Dan huwa l-aħħar ċans tiegħek, tifel tiegħi.
There she was wanting to go.	Kien hemm li hi trid tmur.
That’s a little too much.	Dak huwa ftit wisq.
He had nothing more to say.	Ma kellu xejn aktar xi jgħid.
I know everything you have to say.	Naf dak kollu li għandek xi tgħid.
With us, it certainly never goes wrong.	Magħna, żgur li qatt ma tmur ħażin.
Right now this is the only thing you can do.	Bħalissa din hija l-unika ħaġa li tista 'tagħmel.
Where did that come from?	Minn fejn ġie dak?
It comes quickly.	Jiġi malajr.
I used to eat there.	Kont niekol hemmhekk.
Obviously there is something wrong.	Ovvjament hemm xi ħaġa ħażina.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
There are a lot of problems.	Hemm ħafna problemi.
Only that is not the whole truth.	Biss dik waħda mhix il-verità kollha.
He will have a bit of a chance.	Huwa ser ikollu daqsxejn ta 'ċans.
That’s for us.	Dak hu għalina.
It’s a good, good thing that she’s here.	Hija ħaġa tajba, tajba li hi hawn.
I don't need any more friends.	M'għandix bżonn aktar ħbieb.
Every child is ours.	Kull tifel huwa tagħna.
I’m not a bad boy.	Jien mhux tifel ħażin.
I wanted to know everything about her.	Ridt inkun naf kollox dwarha.
You don’t have to say it before you want to say it.	M'għandekx għalfejn tgħid qabel ma trid tgħid.
It can happen to anyone.	Jista’ jiġri lil kulħadd.
So it was tonight.	Hekk kien illejla.
He needed help.	Huwa kellu bżonn jgħin.
It doesn't work.	Mhux jaħdem.
But come on.	Imma ejja.
He didn't know.	Ma kienx jaf.
I have been saying this for years.	Ilni ngħid dan għal snin.
No one is eating.	Ħadd mhu qed jiekol.
This is a very bad idea.	Din hija idea ħażina ħafna.
But there is nothing.	Imma m'hemm xejn.
The truth is that no one knows.	Il-verità hi li ħadd ma jaf.
It actually looks pretty good.	Huwa fil-fatt jidher pjuttost tajjeb.
You are a good friend.	Int ħabib tajjeb.
But never sure.	Imma qatt ċert.
He knows you are here.	Jaf li int hawn.
Nothing about it.	Xejn dwar dan.
He seems to need one.	Jidher li għandu bżonn wieħed.
I might be a good one.	I jista 'jkun wieħed tajjeb.
And that's good.	U dak tajjeb.
Not so much and not so fast.	Mhux daqshekk u mhux daqshekk malajr.
Few are.	Ftit huma.
Not now and not later.	Mhux issa u mhux aktar tard.
But it was really, really great.	Imma kien tassew, tassew kbir.
It looks like a lot of fun.	Jidher qisu ħafna gost.
He came back.	Ġie lura.
It went really well, too.	Huwa mar tassew tajjeb, ukoll.
That was pretty hard for me.	Dak kien pjuttost diffiċli għalija.
It was late.	Kien sar tard.
Must have.	Għandu jkollu.
Not harder.	Mhux aktar diffiċli.
He speaks very fast.	Huwa jitkellem malajr ħafna.
We know what happened next.	Nafu x’ġara wara.
I don't talk to anyone.	Jien ma nitkellem ma’ ħadd.
Everyone is talking about it.	Kulħadd jitkellem dwar dan.
For too long.	Għal żmien twil wisq.
We will not be here forever.	Aħna mhux se nkunu hawn għal dejjem.
He looked at the door.	Huwa ħares lejn il-bieb.
Whatever that is.	Tkun xi tkun dik.
You are not mine.	M'intix tiegħi.
He just wasn’t in his room.	Biss ma kienx fil-kamra tiegħu.
Currently.	Bħalissa.
They are not everything.	Huma mhux kollox.
he asked.	staqsa.
He would have been working.	Kieku kien ikun qed jaħdem.
Not a big deal, for me.	Mhux ħaġa kbira, għalija.
He would go to school every morning and evening.	Kien imur l-iskola kull filgħodu u filgħaxija.
Or many.	Jew ħafna.
Just think otherwise.	Kemm naħseb mod ieħor.
He talks a lot.	Huwa jitkellem ħafna.
Not for anyone.	Mhux għal ħadd.
You will never know me.	Qatt ma tkun taf miegħi.
On and on and on.	Fuq u fuq u fuq.
It won’t come to that, he thought.	Mhux se jasal għal dan, ħaseb.
Only one thing.	Ħaġa waħda biss.
And he always will be.	U hu dejjem se jkun.
That was hard to say.	Dan kien diffiċli li tgħid.
He could not see.	Ma setax jara.
But no, of course not.	Imma mhux, ovvjament.
Do you want to go out?	Tixtieq tmur barra?
He was very surprised.	Kien sorpriż ħafna.
They just have each other.	Huma għandhom biss lil xulxin.
I don't know how it went.	Ma nafx kif mar.
She needed something better.	Hija kellha bżonn xi ħaġa aħjar.
That's not the only way to win.	Dik mhix xi ħaġa li jista’ jirbaħ għal kollox.
He actually said so.	Huwa fil-fatt qal hekk.
He could barely speak.	Ma tantx seta’ jitkellem.
It may or may not take long.	Jista 'jieħu żmien twil, jew le.
He was just a boy.	Kien tifel biss.
It should be.	Għandu jkun.
It seemed like maybe it wasn’t.	Deher li forsi ma kinitx.
Better sit back.	Aħjar toqgħod lura.
And that can only work.	U dan jista 'biss jaħdem.
This house is great.	Din id-dar hija kbira.
He was so good to me.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb miegħi.
It’s not the first time and it won’t be the last.	Mhux l-ewwel darba u mhux se tkun l-aħħar.
You don’t have to tell anyone.	M'għandekx għalfejn tgħid lil ħadd.
If anything, it was more.	Jekk xejn, kien aktar.
It was really three years.	Kienu verament tliet snin.
About both, in fact.	Dwar it-tnejn, fil-fatt.
I'm not yours.	Jien mhux tiegħek.
Let me tell you a few things.	Ħa ngħidlek ftit affarijiet.
He's back again.	Huwa lura mill-ġdid.
It couldn't have been better.	Ma setax kien tajjeb.
I didn't want to see it.	Ma ridtx nara.
No one should go.	Ħadd ma għandu jmur.
I will be watching.	Se nkun qed nara.
It doesn’t always work.	Mhux dejjem jaħdem.
Or nothing more.	Jew xejn aktar.
But it was, it had to be.	Imma kien, kellu jkun.
That was how far he had come.	Dak kien sa fejn wasal.
A good one.	Waħda tajba.
Something wrong.	Xi ħaġa ħażina.
It works well.	Jaħdem tajjeb.
I often do.	Jien spiss nagħmel.
This is not supposed to happen.	Dan mhux suppost jiġri.
It looks bad, and it’s bad.	Jidher ħażin, u huwa ħażin.
I think it could be both.	Naħseb li jista 'jkun it-tnejn.
He knew that soon enough.	Huwa kien jaf li malajr biżżejjed.
This is not a bad or bad thing.	Din mhix xi ħaġa ħażina jew ħażina.
It wasn’t that I couldn’t speak.	Ma kienx li ma stajtx titkellem.
Very good, very good.	Tajjeb ħafna, ħafna.
I saw it and it still looks good to me.	Rajt u għadu jidher tajjeb għalija.
It's so much better.	Huwa tant aħjar.
If anyone helps, help.	Jekk xi ħadd jgħin, jgħin.
There is nothing he will not do.	M'hemm xejn li mhux se jagħmel.
It's too hard.	Huwa diffiċli wisq.
I never knew you could do that.	Qatt ma kont naf li tista’ tagħmel dan.
The work is almost finished.	Ix-xogħol huwa kważi lest.
We should do this more often.	Għandna nagħmlu dan aktar spiss.
But this is not how it should be.	Imma dan mhux kif għandu jkun.
He was just doing his thing.	Kien hemm biss jagħmel ħaġa tiegħu.
Maybe nothing is here.	Forsi xejn mhu hawn.
And that was the last one.	U dik kienet l-aħħar waħda.
Quick.	Malajr.
Is something wrong?	Qed jiġri xi ħaġa?
No one can leave.	Ħadd ma jista’ jitlaq.
I need to go back to school.	Għandi bżonn immur lura l-iskola.
Every morning.	Kull filgħodu.
I’m just saying this.	Jien ngħid dan biss.
They are some outside.	Huma xi barra.
In fact, they already have.	Fil-fatt, diġà għandhom.
Everyone could see that.	Kulħadd seta' jara dan.
He told me he could definitely help.	Huwa qalli li żgur jista 'jgħin.
Or maybe nothing will happen.	Jew jista 'ma jiġri xejn.
It's a good one.	Huwa wieħed tajjeb.
I didn’t know where I was going to go now.	Ma kontx naf fejn se mmur issa.
One person is good, one person is not.	Persuna waħda hija tajba, persuna waħda mhix.
No it's not.	Le mhuwiex.
Nothing and no one.	Xejn u ħadd.
You have to make it work.	Int għandek tagħmel dan jaħdem.
Obviously, he has done this before.	Ovvjament, huwa għamel dan qabel.
Very someone.	Ħafna xi ħadd.
There she was.	Kien hemm hi.
Maybe it never will.	Forsi qatt ma se.
It was bad then and it is bad now.	Kien ħażin dak iż-żmien u huwa ħażin issa.
What he was trying to do.	Dak li kien qed jipprova jagħmel.
I'm here in need.	Jien hawn bi bżonn.
I also can’t believe this!	Jien ukoll ma nistax nemmen dan!
It works, and it works well.	Jaħdem, u jaħdem tajjeb.
They really do work.	Huma verament jagħmlu xogħol.
It's not me.	M'intix jien.
Okay, you know.	Tajjeb, taf.
He is so happy.	Huwa tant kuntent.
Everyone can see everyone.	Kulħadd jista’ jara lil kulħadd.
That's what you have to do.	Dak għandek tagħmel.
I know a man like that.	Naf raġel bħal dan.
I had never done anything like this before.	Qatt ma kont għamilt xi ħaġa bħal din qabel.
I did so.	Jien hekk għamilt.
He will always be with us.	Dejjem se jkun magħna.
It all happened very quickly.	Kollox ġara malajr ħafna.
He could talk in or out of anything.	Huwa seta 'jitkellem fi jew barra minn xi ħaġa.
No money there.	L-ebda flus hemm.
I don't want to.	Ma rridx.
That should have happened years ago.	Dak kellu jiġri snin ilu.
And why should you !.	U għaliex għandek!.
There is nothing you can do about it.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel.
Everyone passed.	Kulħadd għadda.
That was a bad time.	Dak kien żmien ħażin.
These are mine.	Dawn huma tiegħi.
You know this is wrong.	Taf li dan huwa ħażin.
That can't work.	Li ma jistax jaħdem.
Come on, people.	Ejja, nies.
He doesn't have much money.	M’għandux ħafna flus.
He died shortly afterwards.	Huwa miet ftit wara.
This happened often.	Dan ġara spiss.
To see this just happen.	Biex tara dan jiġri biss.
But it’s not the whole truth.	Imma mhix il-verità kollha.
Tired like everyone else.	Għajjien bħal kulħadd.
But it really does.	Imma tassew jagħmel.
Maybe this will never happen.	Forsi dan qatt mhu se jiġri.
For me, it wasn’t good.	Għalija, ma kienx tajjeb.
He’s just a happy man.	Huwa biss raġel ferħan.
He did everything else pretty well.	Huwa għamel kull ħaġa oħra pjuttost tajjeb.
And there was a lot he wanted to say.	U kien hemm ħafna li ried jgħid.
It was there.	Kien hemm.
That’s what you do well.	Dak hu li tagħmel tajjeb.
I always have.	Jien dejjem għandi.
He is a teacher.	Huwa għalliem.
But nothing wrong.	Imma xejn ħażin.
But he did, didn't he? '	Imma, għamel, hux?'.
It just seemed.	Deher biss.
He is what he is.	Hu dak li hu.
You don't do that, do you?	Int ma tagħmilx hekk, hux?
No work, no money.	L-ebda xogħol, l-ebda flus.
I'm really sorry.	Jien tassew jiddispjaċini.
But eat now.	Imma tiekol issa.
He knew he could do it alone.	Kien jaf li waħdu seta’ jagħmel dan.
You won’t eat anymore either.	Mhux se tiekol aktar lanqas.
She didn’t have to say that, she knew.	Hija ma kellha tgħid dan, kienet taf.
Please don't!	Jekk jogħġbok ma!
Let's know who he is.	Ejja taf li hu.
I really like this book.	Inħobb ħafna dan il-ktieb.
I know you're doing what you can.	Naf li tagħmel dak li tista’.
Not now, maybe not anymore.	Mhux issa, forsi mhux aktar.
But he couldn't.	Imma ma setax.
I understand quite that.	Nifhem pjuttost.
He still makes a lot of money.	Għadu jagħmel ħafna flus.
We will not be able to do this here.	Mhux se nkunu nistgħu nagħmlu dan hawn.
I love his job.	Inħobb ix-xogħol tiegħu.
He never said.	Hu qatt ma qal.
They were one.	Kienu wieħed.
I still can't believe it.	Għadni ma nistax nemmen.
He had no money.	Ma kellux flus.
And that’s what he did for me.	U dak li għamel għalija.
And she was with him.	U hi kienet miegħu.
He thought wrong.	Huwa ħaseb ħażin.
That time had passed.	Dak iż-żmien kien għadda.
You know a lot.	Taf ħafna.
This should not take long.	Dan m'għandux jieħu ħafna ħin.
No one knows for sure.	Ħadd ma jaf żgur.
He was, he saw, he died.	Ġie, ra, miet.
We have too many other problems right now.	Għandna wisq problemi oħra bħalissa.
No more.	Mhux aktar'.
You said that very capable.	Inti qal li kapaċi ħafna.
It's nothing.	Hu xejn.
Don’t go it alone.	M'għandekx tmur waħdek.
I wish it could be me.	Nixtieq li jista 'jkun jien.
And my friend was right.	U ħabib tiegħi kellu raġun.
I didn't have a chance to say that.	Ma kellix ċans ngħid hekk.
You can never go wrong with this one.	Inti qatt ma tista 'tmur ħażin ma' dan wieħed.
Not very often.	Mhux ħafna drabi.
Years later.	Snin wara.
Not years late.	Mhux ta 'snin tard.
I hadn’t thought about it before.	Ma kontx ħsibt dwarha qabel.
Maybe he shouldn’t have done anything.	Forsi ma kellu jagħmel xejn.
He may be right.	Jista’ jkollu raġun.
No, it can't be.	Le, ma jistax ikun.
Here's how to think about it.	Hawn mod kif taħseb dwarha.
We were there last night.	Konna hemm ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
And it was.	U kien.
She is penniless.	Hija bla flus.
What are you saying now.	Dak li qed tgħid issa.
One man.	Raġel wieħed.
Where were they ?.	Fejn kienu?.
He was right.	Kellu raġun.
A lot has happened.	Ġara ħafna.
Being wrong is great.	Li tkun ħażin huwa kbir.
And that's not good.	U dak mhux tajjeb.
There was a problem.	Kien hemm problema.
I do that.	Nagħmel dan.
I wish she could just come.	Nixtieq hi tista 'biss tiġi.
Well, you don't want to know.	Ukoll, ma tridx tkun taf.
Too late, too late, too late.	Tard wisq, tard wisq, tard wisq.
That's the only way.	Dak huwa l-uniku mod.
He can do it.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel dan.
Glad this is done.	Ferħan li dan isir.
Each is good to me.	Kull wieħed huwa tajjeb miegħi.
But it's none of that.	Imma hu xejn minn hekk.
I did.	Jien għamilt.
But I can't understand.	Imma ma nistax nifhem.
It looked the same as before.	Deher l-istess bħal qabel.
He hopes it will happen again soon.	Huwa jittama li jerġa 'jiġri malajr.
Sure, it looks good.	Żgur, jidher tajjeb.
Let's go.	Ejja mmorru.
You can know without knowing.	Tista’ tkun taf mingħajr ma tkun taf.
He will go where you are.	Hu se jmur fejn int.
It's like always.	Huwa bħal dejjem.
You weren’t around.	Inti ma kontx madwar.
the.	le.
I don’t want to be again.	Ma rridx inkun mill-ġdid.
It should.	Għandu.
Now we were on to something.	Issa konna fuq xi ħaġa.
If you can.	Jekk tista.
He was there for three years.	Kien hemm għal tliet snin.
He did as he came home.	Għamel hekk kif ġie d-dar.
You can never tell what such people will do.	Qatt ma tista’ tgħid x’se jagħmlu nies bħal dawn.
And we can.	U nistgħu nistgħu.
That's for sure.	Dak żgur.
But he is not.	Imma hu mhux.
But we have some idea.	Imma għandna xi idea.
I knew that of course.	Jien kont naf li ovvjament.
He wouldn’t need it anymore.	Ma kienx ikollu bżonn aktar.
What about says it all.	Dak dwar jgħid kollox.
I have no way of knowing.	M'għandi l-ebda mod kif inkun naf.
Not too sure.	Mhux wisq ċert.
Too high.	Wisq minn fuq.
I'm a man.	Jien raġel.
This made things easier.	Dan għamel l-affarijiet aktar faċli.
Or you.	Jew int.
And so it will be.	U hekk se jkun.
You just need a little.	Għandek bżonn ftit biss.
No one can know.	Ħadd ma jista’ jkun jaf.
It would be too late.	Kienet tkun tard.
Everything is fine at work.	Kollox huwa tajjeb fuq ix-xogħol.
Not something.	Mhux xi ħaġa.
Everyone had problems.	Kulħadd kellu problemi.
It’s not good enough.	Huwa mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
He is speaking better.	Qed jitkellem aħjar.
I understand that this was.	Nifhem li dan kien.
This is wrong.	Dan huwa ħażin.
Not just here.	Mhux hawn biss.
This has never, ever happened before.	Dan qatt, qatt ma ġara qabel.
He had gone.	Huwa kien mar.
Not the only way.	Mhux l-uniku mod.
Maybe it shouldn’t.	Forsi m'għandux.
Or maybe before.	Jew forsi qabel.
There will be enough time for this later.	Ikun hemm żmien biżżejjed għal dan aktar tard.
It was said it would come, but it wasn’t.	Kien qal li se jiġi, imma ma kienx.
I am supposed to know better.	I suppost naf aħjar.
He had left.	Huwa kien telaq barra.
I'm just worried.	Jien biss inkwetat.
Sometimes, it just takes time.	Xi drabi, dan jieħu biss iż-żmien.
She was good to me.	Kienet tajba miegħi.
He said it was something he had to do.	Qal li kienet xi ħaġa li kellha tagħmel.
He loved that.	Huwa iħobb dak.
She didn’t even know why she had done this.	Lanqas kienet taf għaliex kienet għamlet dan.
I really like this.	Inħobb ħafna dan.
I talk a lot.	Nitkellem ħafna.
He had never seen anything like it, either.	Hu qatt ma kien ra xi ħaġa bħal din, lanqas.
And she was still there.	U kienet għadha hemm.
But she had a chance to think.	Imma kellha ċans taħseb.
It really was.	Kien tassew.
Who is it.	Min hu.
That, too, was done.	Dak, ukoll, sar.
I can do that, you know.	Jien nista' nagħmel dan, taf.
But let me tell you - it was a scary place.	Imma ħa ngħidlek dan.
There is someone else you want to see.	Hemm xi ħadd ieħor li trid tara.
I couldn't do that.	Ma stajtx nagħmel hekk.
Everyone was surprised.	Kulħadd kien sorpriż.
They are mine, better, and not yours.	Huma tiegħi, aħjar, u mhux tiegħek.
It comes back.	Jiġi lura.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwarha.
That's it.	Dak hu.
I just wanted to see what would happen.	Ridt biss nara x'se jiġri.
Being here with you is not a good idea.	Li tkun hawn miegħek mhix idea tajba.
If there was anything you.	Jekk kien hemm xi ħaġa int.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Wasal iż-żmien li mmorru issa.
Everything was great.	Kollox kien kbir.
We need some time here.	Għandna bżonn ftit ħin hawn.
They do this every year.	Jagħmlu dan kull sena.
No one can do that anymore.	Ħadd ma jista 'jagħmel hekk aktar.
There was no way she did that.	L-ebda mod ma għamlet dan.
As you say, no one knows there is.	Kif tgħid, ħadd ma jkun jaf li hemm.
If you stay.	Jekk toqgħod.
No, he didn't tell anyone.	Le, ma qal lil ħadd.
We have to go.	Irridu mmorru.
It was a lot of work.	Kien ħafna xogħol.
It was really beautiful.	Kienet tassew sabiħa.
This was the last.	Dan kien l-aħħar.
I came home after work.	Ġejt lura d-dar wara li għamilt ix-xogħol.
No one talks about it anymore.	Ħadd ma jitkellem aktar dwarha.
She says now is not a good time.	Tgħid li issa mhux żmien tajjeb.
It was early.	Kienet kmieni.
I like it so much.	Jien inħobb ħafna hekk.
Or maybe both.	Jew forsi t-tnejn.
With him I never knew.	Miegħu qatt ma kont taf.
That was another thing he was right about.	Dik kienet ħaġa oħra li kellu raġun dwarha.
This was not so bad.	Dan ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
There is definitely something wrong with it.	Żgur li hemm xi ħaġa ħażina miegħu.
He can do anything.	Jista’ jagħmel xi ħaġa.
He is right about one thing.	Huwa għandu raġun dwar ħaġa waħda.
It does this well.	Jagħmel dan tajjeb.
And maybe he can.	U forsi jista’.
They never do anything.	Huma qatt ma jagħmlu xejn.
What he didn’t know was why.	Li ma kienx jaf kien għaliex.
But he would not come.	Imma ma kienx jiġi.
He knew everything before.	Huwa kien jaf dak kollu qabel.
I don’t think he was good at it.	Ma naħsibx li kien tajjeb għal dan.
Someone has.	Xi ħadd għandu.
I was sitting and doing nothing.	Jien kont noqgħod u nagħmel xejn.
But you must come.	Imma int trid tiġi.
And he may be right.	U jista’ jkun li għandu raġun.
Everyone knew that.	Kulħadd kien jaf li.
It’s just there for me.	Huwa biss hemm għalija.
You knew better.	Kont taf aħjar.
You can do something like this.	Tista' tagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din.
But now, here you are again.	Imma issa, hawn int mill-ġdid.
And he was just a boy.	U kien tifel biss.
There will be no later.	Mhux se jkun hemm aktar tard.
Nothing really happened.	Ma ġara xejn tassew.
I didn’t know how or why.	Ma kontx naf kif jew għaliex.
And you will be there.	U int tkun hemm.
One would also say he was surprised.	Wieħed kien jgħid ukoll li kien sorpriż.
And it will do nothing.	U mhu se jagħmel xejn.
She is not the only one.	Hi mhix l-unika waħda.
We just looked at each other.	Aħna biss ħares lejn xulxin.
No work for you there.	L-ebda xogħol għalik hemmhekk.
It's after that now.	Huwa wara li issa.
I was just a man.	Kont biss raġel.
He should go with you if you wish.	Huwa għandu jmur miegħek jekk tixtieq.
Who are they?	Min huma?
My only chance.	L-uniku ċans tiegħi.
It's an easy job.	Huwa xogħol faċli.
Something to eat.	Xi ħaġa li tiekol.
I know he is.	Naf li hu.
That's there.	Dak hemm.
We will do that.	Aħna se nagħmlu dan.
Maybe she was right.	Forsi kellha raġun.
I was just thinking.	Kont qed naħseb biss.
He said nothing about it.	Huwa ma qal xejn dwar dan.
In fact, it is very, very difficult.	Fil-fatt, huwa diffiċli ħafna, ħafna.
He knew what to do.	Kien jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
It was a beautiful thing.	Kienet ħaġa sabiħa.
I was good.	Kont tajjeb.
But it’s getting there.	Imma qed jasal hemm.
There was something wrong.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa ħażina.
But don’t do that.	Imma tagħmilx hekk.
You can see everything from there.	Tista’ tara kollox minn hemm.
It should be easy.	Għandu jkun faċli.
I came here to talk to you.	Ġejt hawn biex nitkellem miegħek.
And so much more.	U tant aktar.
Well, maybe.	Ukoll, forsi.
It does that too.	Jagħmel dan ukoll.
You don't need me.	Inti m'għandekx bżonn lili.
It really looked good.	Huwa verament ħares tajjeb.
Well, she didn't.	Ukoll, hi ma.
He knows everything.	Jaf kollox.
Where he is when he is not with you.	Fejn hu meta ma jkunx miegħek.
You stay right here.	Inti toqgħod eżatt hawn.
Saying no was not enough.	Li tgħid le ma kienx biżżejjed.
Now, everyone is seeing the same thing.	Issa, kulħadd qed jara l-istess ħaġa.
He did, too.	Huwa għamel, ukoll.
You want to come with me.	Trid tiġi miegħi.
I hope it goes well.	Nispera li sejjer tajjeb.
Which was actually good for me.	Li fil-fatt kien tajjeb għalija.
And this is it.	U dan hu.
This is a good thing.	Din hija ħaġa tajba.
It probably was.	Probabbilment kien.
I will never be afraid again.	Qatt ma nerġa’ nibża’.
It was not there.	Ma kienx hemm.
They are doing something else.	Qed jagħmlu xi ħaġa oħra.
Why he was talking, he didn’t know.	Għaliex kien qed jitkellem, ma kienx jaf.
It seems time.	Jidher iż-żmien.
And it will happen pretty soon.	U se jiġri pjuttost dalwaqt.
I can't tell you anything.	Ma nista’ ngħidlek xejn.
She did it.	Hija għamlet dan.
But there it was.	Imma kien hemm.
I think you are too.	Naħseb li int ukoll.
You don’t want to leave now.	Ma tridx li jitlaq issa.
He didn't have much time.	Ma tantx kellu ħin.
When he wasn’t there he was working.	Meta ma kienx hemm kien qed jaħdem.
And that's not it.	U dak mhux.
But it's not your problem.	Imma mhix il-problema tiegħek.
I think he is doing a very good job.	Naħseb li qed jagħmel xogħol tajjeb ħafna.
We have to do it.	Għandna nagħmlu dan.
It's fun	Huwa gost
It was good.	Kienet tajba.
Don't do it, or you're done.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan, jew inti lest.
I've never seen one so big before.	Qatt ma rajt wieħed daqshekk kbir qabel.
But she had to do it.	Imma hi kellha tagħmel hekk.
It may be too big for him.	Jista’ jkun kbir wisq għalih.
There is nothing we can do about it.	M'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu dwar dan.
If you want.	Jekk trid.
This is good for me.	Dan huwa tajjeb miegħi.
It is nothing more than that.	Mhu xejn aktar minn hekk.
Nothing is too small.	Xejn mhu żgħir wisq.
Today, we know so much more.	Illum, nafu ħafna aktar.
But it can't be done.	Imma ma jistax isir hekk.
And she knew who they were.	U kienet taf min kienu.
I didn’t.	Jien ma kontx.
He didn't even say anything.	Lanqas ma qal xejn.
I was still having fun.	Kont għadni nieħu gost.
Tonight, it’s too much.	Illejla, huwa wisq.
I’m the same way actually.	Jien l-istess mod fil-fatt.
The time has come, he thought.	Il-ħin wasal, ħaseb.
Come one by one.	Ejja waħda waħda.
I did so I did.	Jien għamilt hekk jien.
I don’t think it will.	Ma naħsibx li se.
And so it will be tomorrow.	U hekk se għada.
Never say never.	Qatt tgħid qatt.
Just once again.	Għal darba oħra biss.
You know why.	Taf għaliex.
It must be late.	Għandu jkun tard.
I wanted to do this tonight.	Ridt nagħmel dan illejla.
I am doing so.	Qed nagħmel hekk.
Like, really great.	Bħal, verament kbir.
It was great to see.	Kien kbir li tara.
Nothing ever was.	Xejn qatt ma kien.
I was never there.	Qatt ma kont hemm jien.
You can go either way on this one.	Tista 'tmur jew mod fuq dan wieħed.
I was good.	Kont tajjeb.
I don’t have too many friends.	M'għandix wisq ħbieb.
I think a lot of people do.	Naħseb li ħafna nies jagħmlu.
It would be hard for me, if you come back here.	Ikun diffiċli għalija, jekk tiġi lura hawn.
And she was right.	U kellha raġun.
someone asked.	staqsa xi ħadd.
I will not go back with you.	Jien mhux se mmur lura miegħek.
That's when it happens.	Dak hu meta jiġri.
Maybe more time.	Forsi aktar ħin.
It's too big	Huwa kbir wisq
It seemed to take forever.	Deher li ħa għal dejjem.
There had to be a way to do something.	Kellu jkun hemm mod kif jista’ jagħmel xi ħaġa.
It's not there.	Mhuwiex hemm.
I didn’t even know how much he had.	Lanqas kont naf kemm kellu.
Try that.	Ipprova dak.
That this certainly was.	Li dan żgur kien.
She says it's his.	Hi tgħid li huwa tiegħu.
I'm fine.	Jien tajjeb.
He was seated.	Kien bilqiegħda.
As was his, he is supposed to.	Kif kien tiegħu, huwa suppost.
It was done all the time.	Kien isir il-ħin kollu.
He really does.	Huwa tassew jagħmel dan.
Like a child.	Bħal tifel.
Like now.	Bħal issa.
I saw how good it was.	Rajt kemm kien tajjeb.
What he knows, he knows.	Dak li jaf, jaf.
He is a friend.	Huwa ħabib.
I know what that is.	Naf x'inhu dak.
And its just.	U tiegħu biss.
I'm one.	Jien wieħed.
And it’s still here.	U għadu hawn.
Or what it was supposed to do for you.	Jew dak li suppost kellha tagħmel għalik.
I can think.	Jien nista' naħseb.
He leaves just after.	Huwa jitlaq eżatt wara.
What you need.	Dak li għandek bżonn.
This is what really happened.	Dan huwa dak li verament ġara.
They do so.	Huma jagħmlu hekk.
What had happened.	Dak li kien ġara.
He thought about how he would live.	Huwa ħaseb kif kien se jgħix.
It should not take more than a few hours.	M'għandux jieħu aktar minn ftit sigħat.
All of them.	Kollha kemm huma.
He never knew before.	Qatt ma kien jaf qabel.
You said, sure it would.	Inti għidt, żgur li kieku.
He would never be able to.	Kieku qatt tkun kapaċi.
And she's just a boy.	U hi biss tifel.
But no one is there.	Imma ħadd mhu hemm.
Very happy with me.	Ferħan ħafna miegħi.
Where he had to be, what he had to do.	Fejn kellu jkun, dak li kellu jagħmel.
I'm a man.	Jien raġel.
But I can't understand why.	Imma ma nistax nifhem għaliex.
You're talking to me.	Qed titkellem miegħi.
He’s a good boy, such a good boy.	Huwa tifel tajjeb, tifel daqshekk tajjeb.
You need to know everything.	Jeħtieġ li tkun taf kollox.
I hear that.	Jien nisma' hekk.
I had done a lot.	Kont għamilt ħafna.
It was very difficult for me.	Kien diffiċli ħafna għalija.
Glad you're back.	Ferħan li int lura.
Pretty forever.	Pjuttost għal dejjem.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha.
To think.	Biex taħseb.
They have to.	Għandhom.
Nobody wants to.	Ħadd ma jrid.
You are better than other people.	Inti aħjar minn nies oħra.
Not me, no.	Mhux jien, le.
I'm not.	Jien ma tantx.
But it is not ready yet.	Imma għadu mhux lest.
That's a lot!	Dak huwa ħafna!
It would be better, he thought.	Ikun aħjar, ħaseb.
It has happened quite a few times.	Ġara pjuttost ftit drabi.
It’s good above all else.	Huwa tajjeb fuq kollox.
But no one should have known this.	Imma ħadd ma kellu jkun jaf dan.
For too long.	Għal żmien wisq wisq.
Never ever, really.	Qatt qatt, tassew.
It looks like.	Qisu.
Of course you can go to school.	Ovvjament tista’ tmur l-iskola.
Too late now.	Tard wisq issa.
You can't do your job.	Ma tistax tagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħek.
It couldn't be.	Ma setax ikun.
It was so good.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb.
Actually I like to think not.	Fil-fatt inħobb naħseb le.
He seemed to know exactly what to do.	Deher li kien jaf eżatt x’għandu jagħmel.
Not your truth.	Mhux il-verità tiegħek.
You have to tell me what's wrong.	Għandek tgħidli x'inhu ħażin.
We know each other.	Nafu lil xulxin.
Sure, they are yours.	Żgur, huma tiegħek.
He will come to you.	Hu se jiġi għandek.
I’ll tell you about that one more time.	Ngħidlek dwar dan darba oħra.
It actually happened that way.	Fil-fatt ġara hekk.
And it probably will.	U probabbilment se.
I don’t think he ever did.	Ma naħsibx li qatt għamel.
I think it should work.	Naħseb li għandu jaħdem.
He was very interested.	Kien interessat ħafna.
He has fun loving.	Huwa jieħu gost iħobb.
Everyone always wants more of his never enough.	Kulħadd dejjem irid aktar tiegħu qatt ma biżżejjed.
Good way.	Mod tajjeb.
He knew it was.	Kien jaf li kien.
And me.	U lili.
More on that soon.	Aktar dwar dan dalwaqt.
Everything happens now.	Kollox jiġri issa.
She was never loved.	Hija qatt ma kienet iħobb.
It's very easy.	Huwa faċli ħafna.
And he did.	U li għamel.
It just so happened.	Hekk ġara biss.
I don’t know exactly how it happens or why it happens.	Ma nafx eżatt kif jiġri jew għaliex jiġri.
I think he can.	Naħseb li jista’.
Very little is said about it.	Ftit li xejn jitkellem dwarha.
And for him, what he had was everything.	U għalih, dak li kellu kien kollox.
But I thought, probably more than once.	Imma ħsibt, probabbilment aktar minn darba.
Definitely watching.	Żgur li kien qed jara.
He left for home.	Telaq lejn id-dar.
It should never have been good.	Qatt ma kellha tkun tajba.
I hope he says no.	Nispera li jgħid le.
Not so late.	Mhux daqshekk tard.
There is no way to know for sure.	M'hemm l-ebda mod kif tkun taf żgur.
I have never had problems before.	Qatt ma kelli problemi qabel.
If I were, it wouldn’t be.	Kieku kont, ma jkunx.
His last one.	L-aħħar wieħed tiegħu.
Why do we always do the same things?	Għaliex dejjem nagħmlu l-istess affarijiet?
As you wish.	Kif trid.
Yesterday he was able to think, plan.	Ilbieraħ kien kapaċi jaħseb, jippjana.
You'll see, it will be fine.	Int ser tara, se jkun tajjeb.
Maybe all this is.	Forsi dan kollu hu.
I heard that.	Jien smajt dan.
This is where we are.	Dan huwa fejn aħna.
We will always be here for you.	Aħna dejjem se nkunu hawn għalik.
It gets better.	Jiġi aħjar.
I'm not good.	Jien mhux tajjeb.
You're too big.	Int kbir wisq.
I don’t even want to do that.	Lanqas irrid nagħmel dan.
You must be very surprised by this.	B'dan trid tidher li tkun sorpriż ħafna.
I know me.	Jiena naf jien.
I’ll be home later if you want to talk about it.	Inkun id-dar aktar tard jekk trid titkellem dwarha.
Everyone knew everything.	Kulħadd kien jaf kollox.
More is needed.	Hemm bżonn aktar.
He knew it was much more than that.	Kien jaf li kien ħafna aktar minn hekk.
Enough is enough.	Biżżejjed huwa biżżejjed.
Today they were in.	Illum kienu fi.
It was about three years ago.	Kien madwar tliet snin ilu.
That was good for me.	Dan kien tajjeb miegħi.
He knows what happened.	Jaf x’ġara.
Really, we were.	Tassew, konna.
And to see everything go, just like that.	U biex tara kollox imur, eżatt hekk.
I know where it can be.	Naf fejn jista’ jkun.
Very much in fact.	Ħafna fil-fatt.
I need these before these.	Għandi bżonn dawn qabel dawn.
This is not what we have today.	Dan mhux dak li għandna llum.
He just didn’t want to do that anymore.	Huwa biss ma riedx jagħmel dan aktar.
They hardly do anything.	Ma tantx jagħmlu xejn.
Everyone seemed a bit surprised as well.	Kulħadd deher daqsxejn sorpriż ukoll.
I need to know this.	Għandi bżonn li tkun taf dan.
That's what you know.	Dak hu li taf.
But apparently it is not working.	Imma milli jidher mhux qed jaħdem.
But it was.	Imma kien.
I seem to have problems almost every now and then.	Jidher li għandi problemi kważi kull darba issa.
He must have both. 	Huwa għandu jkollu t-tnejn. 
I just didn’t want to.	Jien biss ma ridtx.
So are we.	Hekk aħna.
She was so beautiful, so capable.	Kienet tant sabiħa, tant kapaċi.
What we did.	Dak li għamilna.
But obviously it is not.	Imma ovvjament ma tkunx.
About many things.	Dwar ħafna affarijiet.
This, she had never done before.	Dan, qatt ma kienet għamlet qabel.
I don't really know.	Ma nafx tassew.
It was never really good.	Qatt ma kien tajjeb verament.
It could not be otherwise.	Ma setax ikun mod ieħor.
I had no idea if that was a good thing or not.	Ma kellix idea jekk dik kinitx xi ħaġa tajba jew le.
We are better when we are together.	Aħna aħjar meta nkunu flimkien.
We’ve been on this before.	Konna konna fuq dan qabel.
It was out.	Kien barra.
It's been a long time.	Ilu żmien.
I wanted to sit down.	Ridt noqgħod bilqiegħda.
Everyone goes home.	Kulħadd imur id-dar.
She does this from time to time.	Hija tagħmel dan minn żmien għal żmien.
I was for something.	Jien kont għal xi ħaġa.
Apparently she did a little more.	Jidher li hija għamlet ftit ieħor.
Everyone knows now.	Kulħadd jaf issa.
He is a boy.	Huwa tifel.
It was never good.	Qatt ma kien tajjeb.
He comes here.	Huwa ġej hawn.
It was yesterday, actually.	Kien ilbieraħ, fil-fatt.
I like this too.	Jien inħobb dan ukoll.
Everyone else is sure to do.	Kulħadd ieħor żgur li jagħmel.
I don’t know why.	Ma nafx għalfejn.
He always told me so.	Dejjem qalli hekk.
We don't.	Aħna ma.
But someone had to do it.	Imma xi ħadd kellu jagħmel dan.
I just want to go back to school.	Irrid biss immur lura l-iskola.
But it’s nothing more.	Imma mhu xejn aktar.
I didn’t need to.	Ma kellix bżonn.
So it was.	Hekk kienet.
Here's what we're going to do.	Hawn x'se nagħmlu.
He will never talk about what happened here to anyone, ever.	Qatt mhu se titkellem dwar dak li ġara hawn lil ħadd, qatt.
You look so much better.	Inti tidher ħafna aħjar.
But that was then and that now.	Imma dak kien dak iż-żmien u dan issa.
There must be a better way.	Għandu jkun hemm mod aħjar.
No one says anything for a while.	Ħadd ma jgħid xejn għal xi żmien.
And nothing came of it.	U xejn ma daħal.
I would be fine.	Jien inkun tajjeb.
You seem to have this more than a lot.	Jidher li għandek dan aktar minn ħafna.
There are some easy things we can do.	Hemm xi affarijiet faċli li nistgħu nagħmlu.
I still couldn’t go there.	Għadni ma stajtx immur hemm.
That will be the same here soon.	Li se jkun l-istess hawn hekk.
Probably more than once.	Probabbilment aktar minn darba.
He should be here, too.	Huwa għandu jkun hawn, ukoll.
It’s not what I wanted at all.	Mhuwiex dak li ridt xejn.
You will be glad you did.	Int tkun ferħan li għamilt.
He gets tired.	Jiġi għajjien.
I am right.	Ikolli raġun.
And you can't do anything.	U ma tistax tagħmel xejn.
That's exactly what happened.	Hekk ġara eżatt.
But no one comes for me.	Imma ħadd ma jiġi għalija.
But she knows one thing.	Imma hi taf ħaġa waħda.
It happens after and before.	Jiġri wara u qabel.
But not.	Imma mhux.
A long time back.	Żmien twil lura.
But the time has come.	Imma jasal iż-żmien.
It's just happening.	Qed jiġri biss.
So he said.	Hekk qal.
I like to hear about it.	Inħobb nisma dwar dan.
But he didn't want to.	Imma hu ma riedx.
It was just as it was.	Kien biss kif kien.
Well, that didn’t look so bad.	Ukoll, dan ma deherx daqshekk ħażin.
I do nothing.	Jien ma nagħmel xejn.
He just needs to play.	Huwa biss jeħtieġ li jilgħab.
This makes our problem much more difficult.	Dan jagħmel il-problema tagħna ħafna aktar diffiċli.
I had never seen this car before.	Qatt ma kont rajt din il-karozza qabel.
Whether you're long.	Kemm jekk int twil.
Definitely will.	Żgur li se.
I will, too.	Ikolli, ukoll.
It looks bad.	Jidher ħażin.
Some other way.	Xi mod ieħor.
There was little time.	Kien hemm ftit ħin.
Just over a year ago.	Ftit aktar minn sena ilu.
Let's go home.	Ejja mmorru d-dar.
I'm not ready.	Jien mhux lest.
And as she says.	U kif tgħid hi.
He was a man.	Kien raġel.
No one else knows, or will ever know.	Ħadd ieħor ma jaf, jew qatt se jkun jaf.
One way is alone.	Mod wieħed huwa biss waħdek.
But it shouldn’t have appeared.	Imma ma kellux jidher.
This we both knew.	Dan it-tnejn konna nafu.
How did we do it?	Kif għamilna?
It was working well.	Kien qed jaħdem tajjeb.
He had never asked.	Hu qatt ma kien talab.
So much you can't.	Tant ma tistax.
But we know what was really going on.	Imma nafu x’kien qed jiġri tassew.
If he could.	Kieku jista’.
He didn’t want to, supposedly.	Hu ma riedx, suppost.
And that’s good for me.	U dan hu tajjeb miegħi.
I can.	Nista'.
He is not happy.	Mhuwiex kuntent.
I did it.	Jien għamilt dan.
And you don't.	U inti ma.
But she can't see.	Imma hi ma tistax tara.
And he almost did.	U kważi għamel.
You have to do it.	Int trid tagħmel dan.
This is a great chance.	Dan huwa ċans kbir.
And she.	U hi.
But it says nothing.	Imma tgħid xejn.
Because there, he said, and there it was.	Għaliex hemm, qal, u hemm kien.
Just to.	Biss biex.
I have been waiting a long time.	Ilni nistenna ħafna.
That we did.	Li għamilna.
She is very beautiful.	Hija sabiħa ħafna.
Okay, you know.	Tajjeb, taf.
You think you're happy with that.	Taħseb li tkun ferħan b’dan.
Not sure how this helps.	Mhux ċert kif dan jgħin.
Now.	Issa .
I was not afraid.	Ma kontx nibża’.
And so it does.	U hekk jagħmel.
You have one.	Għandek waħda.
I would say so.	Jien ngħid hekk.
You know nothing about it.	Inti ma taf xejn dwar dan.
No, not anyone else.	Le, mhux xi ħadd ieħor.
I’m like one who died young.	Jien bħal wieħed li miet żgħir.
She had nothing.	Hija ma kellha xejn.
I was glad.	Jien kont ferħan.
It's so good, people.	Huwa daqshekk tajjeb, nies.
Or maybe just a lot of people.	Jew forsi biss ħafna nies.
I was a small child.	Kont tifel żgħir.
And it's wrong.	U huwa ħażin.
One year we had a man who was really good.	Sena kellna raġel li kien tassew tajjeb.
I thought it was so.	Ħsibt li kien hekk.
Not a great chance.	Mhux ċans kbir.
We both have.	It-tnejn għandna.
That someone was right.	Dak xi ħadd kellu raġun.
I thought, this is that long.	Ħsibt, dan huwa dak twil.
And when.	U meta.
It’s almost like you’re really there.	Huwa kważi qisu int verament hemm.
I was so surprised.	Kont tant sorpriż.
It will not do that.	Mhux se tagħmel dan.
I hope to be all he wanted me to be.	Jien nittama li nkun dak kollu li ried hu.
Neither do you.	U lanqas int.
Where ever ?.	Fejn qatt?.
But you can see.	Imma tista 'tara.
And neither do you.	U int lanqas.
But there they were.	Imma hemm kienu.
It should be ready soon.	Għandu jkun lest dalwaqt.
It comes at a good time.	Jiġi fi żmien tajjeb.
That’s what you know.	Dak hu li taf.
Maybe it was still.	Forsi kienet għadha.
Of people you knew.	Ta’ nies li kont taf.
This usually happens after eating.	Dan normalment jiġri wara li tiekol.
I loved being there.	Iħobb ikun hemm.
It's a great car.	Hija karozza kbira.
It was out.	Kien barra.
Ready to go?	Lest biex tmur?
It can't be done.	Ma jistax isir.
I’m going to do very well, now.	Jien se nagħmel tajjeb ħafna, issa.
You were not a child.	Inti ma kontx tifel.
It once happened to me.	Darba ġara lili.
In fact she knew nothing.	Fil-fatt ma kienet taf xejn.
But something was wrong.	Imma xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
There are many.	Hemm ħafna.
Above all.	Fuq kollox.
I'm listening.	Qed nisma’.
This, and nothing more.	Dan, u xejn aktar.
I was tired too.	Jien kont għajjien ukoll.
A long time ago.	Żmien twil ilu .
I don’t want to hear more about this.	Ma rridx nisma aktar dwar dan.
I thought he could play.	Ħsibt li jista’ jilgħab.
Or not.	Jew le.
But that’s not what happened here.	Imma dan mhux dak li ġara hawn.
It would be.	Ikun sejjer.
Not sure why.	Mhux ċert għaliex.
I have yet to try.	Għadni irrid nipprova.
And she was going to do it.	U kienet se tagħmel dan.
I'll talk to him soon.	Dalwaqt nitkellem miegħu.
I don’t know where that came from, but it was.	Ma nafx minn fejn ġie dak, imma kien.
It was later.	Kienet aktar minn tard.
But not you.	Imma mhux int.
But no, this was not to be.	Imma le, dan ma kellux ikun.
So much fun.	Tant gost.
Someone can say something.	Xi ħadd jista 'jgħid xi ħaġa.
That was what he was waiting for.	Dan kien dak li kien qed jistenna.
I can see so much.	Nista' nara daqshekk.
But it didn’t have to be him.	Imma ma kellux ikun hu.
Obviously, it was a problem.	Ovvjament, kienet problema.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
You saw it.	Inti rajt.
But, of course, she never did.	Imma, ovvjament, qatt ma għamlet.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
It’s not hard to see why.	Mhux diffiċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
And there were other things.	U kien hemm affarijiet oħra.
But its time has come.	Imma wasal iż-żmien tiegħu.
Tell me yours.	Tgħidli tiegħek.
This week and next.	Din il-ġimgħa u d-dieħla.
But I am.	Imma jien.
It’s going pretty well right now.	Huwa sejjer pjuttost tajjeb bħalissa.
I never said no.	Qatt ma għedt le.
I don’t want anyone to know, actually.	Ma rrid li ħadd ikun jaf, fil-fatt.
We can be here.	Nistgħu nkunu hawn.
The time to speak has come.	Il-ħin biex titkellem wasal ilu.
What is he doing now? 	X'qed jagħmel issa?
This is not good.	Dan mhux tajjeb.
Maybe more now than ever.	Forsi aktar issa minn qatt qabel.
He wanted to be.	Ried jiġi.
I just can’t.	Jien biss ma nistax.
Sorry I came back with you so late.	Jiddispjaċini li ġejt lura miegħek daqshekk tard.
I am too glad to be of help.	Jien ferħan wisq li nkun ta' għajnuna.
He does a good job.	Huwa jagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
It's been a long time.	Għadda ieħor twil.
But he had no idea how much time he had.	Imma ma kellux idea ta’ kemm kellu ħin.
She looked great.	Hija ħares kbira.
It's been a long time.	Ilu żmien twil.
I love to love.	Jien inħobb inħobb.
I thought it was great.	Ħsibt li kien kbir.
I couldn’t believe it either.	Lanqas stajt nemmen.
Maybe a little too much.	Forsi ftit wisq.
Really nice idea.	Idea sabiħa tassew.
Until tomorrow it will not be good for anyone.	Sa għada ma jkun tajjeb għal ħadd.
And something else.	U xi ħaġa oħra.
It's hard to see.	Huwa diffiċli li tara.
I’ve been doing this for years.	Jien għamilt hekk għal snin.
I will do this if you want me to do so.	Jien se nagħmel dan jekk tixtieq li nagħmel hekk.
You know when.	Taf meta.
Or was it.	Jew kien.
I was afraid I had gone there forever.	Kont nibża li kont mort hemm għal dejjem.
You can't or not.	Ma tistax jew le.
I don’t do any of these things.	Jien ma nagħmel xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet.
Who is it.	Min hu.
There must be something.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa.
It's yours if you want.	Huwa tiegħek jekk trid.
Something wrong.	Xi ħaġa ħażina.
He will win, not really.	Huwa se jirbaħ, mhux verament.
One man can.	Raġel wieħed jista’.
I’m just saying what it was.	Qed ngħid biss dak li kien.
In addition there will be other things.	Barra minn hekk se jkun hemm affarijiet oħra.
She was just sitting there.	Kienet biss bilqiegħda hemm.
I'm not ready.	Jien mhux lest.
And it may still be.	U jista 'għadu.
There needs to be more.	Jeħtieġ li jkun hemm aktar.
His time has come.	Jasal iż-żmien tiegħu.
For a long time, too.	Għal żmien twil, ukoll.
I don't want to be here.	Ma rridx inkun hawn.
Pretty much everyone.	Pjuttost kulħadd.
I don't know anything more.	Ma naf xejn aktar.
That has to go.	Dak ikollu jmur.
He is there and he is there.	Hu qiegħed hemm u qiegħed hemm.
I will be sure to do so.	Inkun żgur li nagħmel hekk.
I wanted everyone to be happy.	Ridt li kulħadd ikun kuntent.
Before it was too late.	Qabel ma kien tard wisq.
It never was and never will be.	Qatt ma kien u qatt ma se.
He didn't have to.	Huwa ma kellux.
That’s pretty much what it was.	Dak huwa pjuttost dak li kien.
What I did is wrong.	Dak li għamilt huwa ħażin.
Now you can just tell me.	Issa tista’ tgħidli biss.
I'm everything, he said.	Jien kollox, qal.
It was, for me.	Kienet, għalija.
This is not a bad thing.	Din mhix xi ħaġa ħażina.
It's just great.	Hija biss kbira.
Well, that’s what happened.	Ukoll, dan huwa dak li ġara.
More.	Aktar.
Try it.	Ipprova.
He is thinking too much and nothing.	Qed jaħseb wisq u xejn.
More and more.	Aktar u aktar.
It was too easy, though.	Kien faċli wisq, dan.
We do a lot there.	Nagħmlu ħafna hemmhekk.
They obviously will.	Huma ovvjament se.
We have to do that work.	Irridu nagħmlu dak ix-xogħol.
It happens here and there.	Jiġri hawn u hemm.
You are out for it now.	Inti barra għalik issa.
This can work very well, too.	Dan jista 'jaħdem tajjeb ħafna, ukoll.
He had some problems before.	Huwa kellu xi problemi qabel.
But of course you want to.	Imma ovvjament trid.
He never wanted to be.	Hu qatt ma ried ikun.
It’s nothing to me anymore.	Hu xejn għalija aktar.
Or he.	Jew hu.
So have you.	Hekk għandek.
Much better than he thought.	Ħafna aħjar milli kien ħaseb.
I don’t know when he is.	Ma nafx meta hu.
I could never tell.	Qatt ma stajt ngħid.
I didn’t know he was doing this all the time.	Ma kontx naf li tagħmel dan il-ħin kollu.
For many people.	Għal ħafna nies.
You don’t have to do that.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel dan.
I didn’t want to.	Ma ridtx.
I think that would be a problem.	Naħseb li tkun problema.
Never left.	Qatt telaq.
Better that way.	Aħjar hekk.
I was very, very bad.	Jien kont ħażin ħafna, ħafna.
I can't go to him.	Ma nistax immur għandu.
We are almost here.	Aħna kważi hawn.
Maybe we can go there a little more often.	Forsi nistgħu mmorru hemm ftit aktar spiss.
And that was just it.	U dan kien biss hekk.
Everyone gets to talk.	Kulħadd jasal biex jitkellem.
Tomorrow, she's yours.	Għada, hi tiegħek.
It can be said to be ready.	Wieħed jista 'jgħid li huwa lest.
Maybe not.	Forsi mhux.
I have only been once.	Ġejt darba biss.
Everything is wrong.	Kollox huwa ħażin.
That's pretty.	Dak huwa pjuttost.
You can't do that.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan.
I’m not so sure about everything.	Jien mhux daqshekk ċert dwar kollox.
He doesn't want to be.	Ma jridx jiġi.
I’m trying a lot.	Qed nipprova ħafna.
She knows everything about her.	Hija taf kollox dwarha.
He can eat.	Jista’ jiekol.
I have been doing this for a few years.	Ilni nagħmel dan għal ftit snin.
Well, maybe it will and maybe it won’t.	Ukoll, forsi se u forsi mhux se.
It could, but it wasn't.	Seta’, imma ma kienx.
I saw something more.	Rajt xi ħaġa aktar.
But no one took me so far.	Imma ħadd ma ħa miegħi daqshekk.
There’s a little you can’t do.	Hemm ftit li ma tistax tagħmel.
There are many.	Hemm ħafna.
I can't talk anymore.	Ma nistax nitkellem aktar.
They don't try anything.	Huma ma jipprova xejn.
Now it is too late.	Issa huwa tard wisq.
It was soon easy to see why.	Dalwaqt kien faċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
I actually know this.	Fil-fatt naf dan.
He is still waiting.	Għadu qed jistenna.
Nothing was done.	Xejn sar xi ħaġa.
I think he does.	Naħseb li jagħmel.
In fact more than a few.	Fil-fatt aktar minn ftit.
And that's all about it.	U dan huwa dak kollu dwar.
I didn’t really think about it.	Ma tantx ħsibt dwarha.
It does nothing.	Ma jagħmel xejn.
But he was worried.	Imma kien inkwetat.
Or not really.	Jew mhux verament.
She does something she wants to do.	Hi tagħmel xi ħaġa li trid tagħmel.
But it has to be done !.	Imma jrid isir!.
I wanted that with him.	Jien ridt li miegħu.
It's like this.	Huwa bħal dan.
It was a good thing to know.	Kienet xi ħaġa tajba li tkun taf.
I was glad for that.	Kont ferħan għal dan.
Until then.	Sa dak iż-żmien.
I’m glad to be back.	Jien ferħan li nerġa' lura.
Someone wanted to know something.	Xi ħadd kien ried ikun jaf xi ħaġa.
I have much more to say.	Għandi ħafna aktar xi ngħid.
All or what you are thinking.	Kollha jew dak li qed jaħseb.
I wasn’t ready for that.	Jien ma kontx lest għal dan.
It never seems like anyone is doing that.	Qatt ma jidhirx li xi ħadd qed jagħmel hekk.
Hopefully !.	Wieħed jista' jittama!.
It was a difficult time.	Kien żmien diffiċli.
I didn’t do much.	Jien ma tantx għamilt ħafna.
But you can see too much.	Imma tista' tara wisq.
It wasn’t as hard as he thought it would be.	Ma kienx diffiċli daqs kemm ħaseb li se jkun.
That’s so hard for me.	Dak daqshekk diffiċli għalija.
I'm not very well.	Jien ma tantx tajjeb.
Each one.	Kull wieħed.
Do you need help? 	Għandek bżonn għajnuna?
Not everyone was happy.	Mhux kulħadd kien kuntent.
I went to my friend.	Mort ħabib tiegħi.
And so we did.	U hekk għamilna.
He wasn’t sure why he was coming.	Ma kienx ċert għaliex kien jiġi.
Try some time.	Ipprova xi żmien.
He did the only thing he could think of doing.	Huwa għamel l-unika ħaġa li seta' jaħseb li jagħmel.
But beautiful better.	Imma sabiħa aħjar.
It’s about talking rather than saying.	Hija dwar titkellem aktar milli tgħid.
Just another thing.	Ħaġa oħra biss.
To be with him.	Biex tkun miegħu.
It was, he.	Kien, hu.
Whatever happens, it happens.	Ikun xi jkun jiġri, jiġri.
He does the same.	Huwa jagħmel l-istess.
I wonder if this will be me soon.	Nistaqsi jekk dan hux se nkun jien dalwaqt.
There must be a better way.	Għandu jkun hemm mod aħjar.
You don't want that, of course.	Inti ma tridx li, ovvjament.
This is so bad.	Dan huwa tant ħażin.
I didn’t need to say so.	Ma kellix bżonn ngħid hekk.
That's about it.	Dik hija dwarha.
It still may not be enough.	Għadu jista 'ma jkunx biżżejjed.
He doesn't talk to anyone, he is always alone.	Ma jitkellem ma’ ħadd, u jkun dejjem waħdu.
Everything was pretty ready.	Kollox kien pjuttost lest.
What they are really doing.	Dak li qed jagħmlu verament.
This too will not work.	Dan ukoll mhux se jaħdem.
Maybe so it happened here.	Forsi hekk ġara hawn.
You can't say anything.	Ma tista’ tgħid xejn.
I don't want to do that again either.	Ma rridx nerġa’ nagħmel hekk lanqas.
I don’t know how to do that.	Ma nafx kif nagħmel dan.
She is a child only.	Hija tifel biss.
That’s good enough for me.	Dan huwa tajjeb biżżejjed għalija.
He will stand there, without speaking.	Hu ser joqgħod hemm, mingħajr ma jitkellem.
And she knows she can do it.	U hi taf li tista’ tagħmel dan.
It takes a long time.	Huwa jieħu ħafna ħin.
Maybe for a while.	Forsi għal ftit żmien.
Probably you don't.	Probabbilment inti ma.
She can never go back.	Hija qatt ma tista 'tmur lura.
I want to know where it came from.	Irrid inkun naf minn fejn ġie.
Someone did this for me a long time ago.	Xi ħadd għamel dan għalija żmien twil ilu.
And he is doing it.	U qed jagħmel dan.
I have a very good idea.	Għandi idea tajba ħafna.
It is either this or nothing.	Huwa jew dan jew xejn.
Well, so be it.	Ukoll, hekk ikun.
I’m not very interested.	Jien ma tantx interessat.
Most likely before now.	Probabbli ħafna qabel issa.
I didn’t do anything wrong.	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin.
We cannot and do not need to do this.	Ma nistgħux u m’għandniex bżonn nagħmlu dan.
But they do.	Imma jagħmlu.
If only something.	Jekk biss xi ħaġa.
But probably the same as yours.	Imma probabbilment l-istess bħal tiegħek.
How long ago.	Kemm kien ilu.
You can see these here and here.	Tista 'tara dawn hawn hawn u hawn.
She would come and go.	Kienet tiġi u tmur.
It never was.	Qatt ma kien.
I have never heard of it again.	Qatt ma smajt mill-ġdid.
I had one.	Kelli waħda.
Maybe he did.	Forsi hekk għamel.
And we had it all, you know.	U kellna kollox, taf.
It did not appear.	Ma deherx.
He will know.	Hu se jkun jaf.
He couldn’t have.	Ma setax ikollu.
This was happening.	Dan kien qed jiġri.
Another had.	Wieħed ieħor kellu.
I'm very happy.	Jien kuntent ħafna.
I'm not you.	Jien mhux int.
It is forever.	Huwa għal dejjem.
But there was no time.	Imma ma kienx hemm żmien.
But he wanted to know.	Imma ried ikun jaf.
But he’s not that, either.	Imma hu mhux dak, lanqas.
That would be good.	Dan ikun tajjeb.
We have what we are doing at home.	Għandna dak li qed nagħmlu fuq id-dar.
I saw the things I did.	Rajt l-affarijiet li għamilt.
I did too.	Jien għamilt ukoll.
I think we have a problem here.	Naħseb li għandna problema hawn.
I expect more.	Nistenna aktar.
But not as you are.	Imma mhux kif int.
You can come with me.	Tista’ tiġi miegħi.
It’s too small for me.	Huwa wisq żgħir għalija.
He will be back.	Hu ser ikun lura.
We have a lot of money.	Għandna ħafna flus.
He thought nothing more about it.	Huwa ħaseb xejn aktar dwar dan.
As I'm there.	Kif jien hemmhekk.
That was his thing.	Dik kienet ħaġa tiegħu.
Bad and good.	Ħażin u tajjeb.
What is it?	Dak X'inhu?
Better be ready.	Aħjar ikun lest.
I can wait.	Nista' nistenna.
Look at your book.	Ħares lejn il-ktieb tiegħek.
Very good for you.	Tajjeb ħafna għalik.
Like, me, today.	Bħal, jien, illum.
There were people.	Kien hemm nies.
I don’t want to hear about it.	Ma rridx nisma dwarha.
I needed to know more.	Kelli nkun naf aktar.
He never came home.	Hu qatt ma ġie d-dar.
She wants to be.	Hija trid tkun.
I just want it to happen.	Irrid biss li jiġri.
For a while.	Għal xi żmien.
There was almost not enough.	Kważi ma kienx hemm biżżejjed.
I had to be with someone.	Kelli nkun ma’ xi ħadd.
he said.	hu qal.
You don’t even know it.	Lanqas taf int.
He who had not died.	Min ma kellux miet.
No, no, my friend.	Le, le, ħabib tiegħi.
I don’t want to see what’s out there.	Ma rridx nara x'hemm hemmhekk.
I can’t believe otherwise.	Ma nistax nemmen mod ieħor.
You are not thinking about anything else.	M'intix taħseb dwar xi ħaġa oħra.
That sounds bad, doesn't it?	Dan jidher ħażin, hux?
Everyone loves it very early around here.	Kulħadd iħobb ħafna kmieni madwar hawn.
Obviously we would never have been.	Ovvjament qatt ma konna nkunu.
First do other things.	L-ewwel jagħmel affarijiet oħra.
Once, he loved this house.	Darba, kien iħobb din id-dar.
It comes whenever the time comes.	Jiġi kull meta jasal iż-żmien.
Look back.	Ħares lura.
Not so there.	Mhux hekk hemmhekk.
It will be, we need more help.	Se jkun, għandna bżonn aktar għajnuna.
We know.	Aħna nafu.
They just have to.	Huma biss għandhom.
He didn't want to.	Ma riedx.
He said nothing.	Ma qal xejn.
But he couldn't.	Imma ma setax.
Everyone.	Kulħadd.
I had a little bit of how to tell problems and that’s over.	Kelli ftit kif tgħid problemi u li hemm fuq.
I have no idea where to go.	M'għandix idea minn fejn immur.
Please? 	Jekk jogħġbok?
I did nothing.	Jien ma għamilt xejn.
He doesn’t want to talk.	Ma jridx jitkellem.
You know nothing.	Ma taf xejn.
Or, well.	Jew, ukoll.
He says something, she says something.	Jgħid xi ħaġa, hi tgħid xi ħaġa.
What he wanted was always good.	Dak li ried kien dejjem tajjeb.
She needed it so much not to be there.	Hija tant kellha bżonn biex ma tkunx hemm.
What really happened.	X'ġara tassew.
I just fell in love with him.	Għadni kemm inħobb miegħu.
You don’t even want to.	Int lanqas trid.
What happened will never happen again.	Dak li kien ġara qatt ma jerġa’ jiġri.
That’s another thing.	Dik hija ħaġa oħra.
I know all of these.	Jien naf dawn kollha.
It was the first thing he had said since everyone arrived.	Kienet l-ewwel ħaġa li kien qal minn meta wasal kulħadd.
I really wasn’t me.	Jien verament ma kontx jien.
I had no idea how he knew this.	Ma kellix idea kif kien jaf dan.
It was not ready yet.	Għadu ma kienx lest.
For many years.	Għal ħafna snin.
It can be difficult.	Jista 'jkun diffiċli.
And before.	U qabel.
I had seen this.	Jien kont rajt dan.
I can't even see what it is.	Lanqas nista’ nara x’inhu.
That was the only time.	Dik kienet l-unika darba.
He had more, too.	Kellu aktar, ukoll.
I want to know.	Irrid inkun naf.
Maybe not for you but for me.	Forsi mhux għalik imma għalija.
He had arrived a little early.	Huwa kien wasal ftit kmieni.
He will never do it again.	Hu qatt mhu se jerġa’ jagħmel dan.
That would have been better.	Dan kien ikun aħjar.
Look at this.	Ħares lejn dan.
And she is taking.	U hi qed tieħu.
Something is happening.	Qed jiġri xi ħaġa.
.	.
How do you do that?	Kif tagħmel dan?
And so it should.	U hekk għandu.
But now he was sure.	Imma issa kien ċert.
Not only that.	Mhux hekk biss.
I have nothing.	Jien m'għandi xejn.
Nothing happened.	Ma ġara xejn.
Like never before.	Bħal qatt.
He was too alone.	Kien wisq waħdu.
It’s good with me either way.	Huwa tajjeb miegħi jew mod.
This will not do.	Dan mhux se jagħmel.
This happens to you as well.	Dan jiġri hekk għalik ukoll.
Everyone went very well, really well.	Kulħadd mar tajjeb ħafna, tassew tajjeb.
Maybe again.	Forsi darba oħra.
It took a long time.	Huwa ħa ħafna żmien.
It was always there.	Dejjem kien hemm.
Nobody did.	Ħadd ma għamel.
And so it will be with us forever.	U hekk ikun għal dejjem magħna.
I didn’t know they were there.	Ma kontx naf li kienu hemm.
No, he thought.	Le, ħaseb.
You don't need it now.	M'għandekx bżonn issa.
But no one says anything.	Imma ħadd ma jgħid xejn.
It was a big one, he says.	Kienet waħda kbira, jgħid.
I'm with you on that.	Jien miegħek fuq dak.
But so it seemed before.	Imma hekk deher qabel.
Why he doesn't, it's hard to say.	Għaliex hu ma, huwa diffiċli li wieħed jgħid.
I have many things for you today.	Għandi ħafna affarijiet għalik illum.
I never had any problems with it.	Qatt ma kelli xi problemi miegħu.
Or the car.	Jew il-karozza.
Why would he.	Għaliex kieku hu.
I'm still like that.	Għadni hekk.
I don’t want to see anything.	Ma rrid nara xejn.
It was too late, too late.	Kien tard wisq, tard wisq.
I tell you so.	Jien ngħidlek hekk.
There is one thing.	Hemm ħaġa waħda.
I just don’t know.	Jien biss ma nafx.
It's so bad.	Huwa daqshekk ħażin.
You don't want me.	Inti ma tridx lili.
It's too much, too long.	Huwa wisq, twil wisq.
But nothing like what is happening now.	Imma xejn bħal dak li qed jiġri issa.
Not a good thing.	Mhux ħaġa tajba.
I thought.	Kont ħsibt.
Everything that could go wrong went wrong.	Dak kollu li jista’ jmur ħażin mar ħażin.
I would be fine now.	Inkun tajjeb issa.
And it's good.	U huwa tajjeb.
How did he do that?	Kif għamel dan?
It's a really good time.	Huwa tassew żmien tajjeb.
Well that.	Ukoll li.
Not much, maybe.	Mhux ħafna, forsi.
You can't come.	Ma tistax tiġi.
I had this problem once.	Kelli din il-problema darba.
He is a good friend.	Huwa ħabib tajjeb.
And so he did.	U hekk għamel.
That's all.	Dan huwa kollox.
Well, to tell you what happened.	Ukoll, biex ngħidlek x'ġara.
That's not me.	Dak mhux jien.
This actually happens a lot.	Dan fil-fatt jiġri ħafna.
He didn’t like to drive.	Ma kienx iħobb isuq.
So it is with this.	Hekk huwa ma 'dan.
That’s not for me to say.	Dak mhux għalija ngħid.
I wanted to believe so.	Jien kont ridt nemmen hekk.
I said for sure.	għidt żgur.
You can say they are yours.	Tista’ tgħid li huma tiegħek.
I hardly believe it will happen.	Jien ma tantx nemmen li se jiġri.
Many, many things.	Ħafna, ħafna affarijiet.
Just one of many.	Wieħed biss minn ħafna.
I'm afraid not.	Nibża li le.
Very little has been done.	Sar ftit li xejn.
Maybe that's good.	Forsi dik hija tajba.
And it works.	U jaħdem.
Now he was big enough and she knew.	Issa kien kbir biżżejjed u hi kienet taf.
I don’t know why this is happening.	Ma nafx għalfejn qed jiġri dan.
Whatever it is.	Ikun xi jkun hemm.
Not properly.	Mhux kif suppost.
That had never happened before.	Dak qatt ma kien ġara qabel.
But he did nothing.	Imma xejn ma għamel.
Come on.	Ejja.
He had a problem.	Kellu problema.
I was a very young boy at the time.	Dak iż-żmien kont tifel żgħir ħafna.
Nothing is right, nothing is as it seems.	Xejn mhu tajjeb, xejn mhu kif jidher.
And it probably won’t.	U probabbilment ma jagħmilx hekk.
It makes everything easier.	Jagħmel kollox aktar faċli.
In fact, he is now leaving.	Fil-fatt, issa qed jitlaq.
I really wanted to too.	Verament ridt ukoll.
I didn’t expect that.	Ma kontx nistenna hekk.
Neither are they.	Lanqas huma.
My time works.	Il-ħin tiegħi jaħdem.
He had little.	Kellu ftit.
It is not.	Mhuwiex.
Not everyone thinks this is a good idea.	Mhux kulħadd jaħseb li din hija idea tajba.
It was late in the evening.	Kien tard filgħaxija.
Everyone needs it.	Kull wieħed għandu bżonn.
I don’t like it there.	Ma nħobbx hemmhekk.
They weren’t even out long ago.	Kienu lanqas ilu barra.
This we did.	Dan għamilna.
Why not?	Għaliex le?
There is more to it than that.	Hemm aktar minn hekk.
It's been years.	Ilu snin.
He said he didn’t know why he did it.	Qal li ma kienx jaf għaliex għamel dan.
You are good to me, you know.	Inti tajjeb għalija, taf.
I knew where he was going.	Kont naf fejn kien sejjer.
I’m too young for him.	Jien żgħir wisq għalih.
Or quite early.	Jew pjuttost kmieni.
But you can't.	Imma ma tistax.
Someone else will, too.	Xi ħadd ieħor se, ukoll.
With another teacher.	Ma’ għalliem ieħor.
No one ever told me.	Ħadd qatt ma qalli.
He's just trying to be helpful.	Huwa biss qed jipprova jkun ta 'għajnuna.
I have no friends.	M'għandix ħbieb.
We need to know what happened.	Irridu nkunu nafu x’ġara.
I live here.	Jien noqgħod hawn.
I'm going now.	Jien sejjer issa.
I am to be with him.	Jiena li għandek tkun miegħu.
This is going to be a problem.	Din se tkun problema.
That's what he does.	Huwa dak li jagħmel.
I had no idea what had happened.	Ma kellix idea x’ġara.
This so quickly.	Dan hekk malajr.
No one needs such money.	Ħadd ma għandu bżonn flus bħal dawn.
She didn't know what to say.	Hija ma kinitx taf x'se tgħid.
We know this for sure.	Dan nafu żgur.
Why think anything else.	Għaliex taħseb xi ħaġa oħra.
Lots of money.	Ħafna flus.
It was there.	Kien hemm.
If it weren't for him, it would be someone else.	Kieku ma kienx hu, kien ikun xi ħadd ieħor.
They do that job well.	Huma jagħmlu dak ix-xogħol tajjeb.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
Not much more to say.	Mhux wisq aktar xi ngħid.
This could be the case at times.	Hekk seta’ jkun xi drabi.
That’s pretty much what happened.	Dak huwa pjuttost dak li ġara.
It was here before.	Kien hawn qabel.
You have to do something.	Għandek tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I don't have to.	M'għandix għalfejn.
It's almost everyone.	Huwa kważi kulħadd.
But in fact it was more than that.	Imma fil-fatt kien aktar minn hekk.
We knew it wasn't going to be easy.	Konna nafu li mhux se jkun faċli.
And now he was here.	U issa kien hawn.
You have to know better than that.	Għandek tkun taf aħjar minn hekk.
Much more could be done.	Seta’ sar ħafna aktar.
She's on.	Hi hemm fuq.
No one else went there.	Ħadd ieħor ma mar hemm.
Also, this was a difficult time.	Barra minn hekk, dan kien żmien diffiċli.
Nor was there.	Lanqas ma kien hemm.
It would not be in the morning.	Ma jkunx filgħodu.
I’m good at this.	Jien tajjeb b'dan.
There can be no other.	Ma jistax ikun hemm ieħor.
He doesn't have much money.	M’għandux ħafna flus.
He never went to play.	Hu qatt ma mar jilgħab.
This is not bad.	Dan mhux ħażin.
You have what you want.	Għandek dak li ridt.
I can hope !.	nista' nittama!.
He was very good to me.	Kien tajjeb ħafna miegħi.
Now, of course he will say so.	Issa, ovvjament se jgħid hekk.
A few years.	Ftit snin.
That says what it has to say.	Li jgħid dak li għandu xi jgħid.
I'm ready, he said.	Jien lest, qal.
It was just.	Kienet biss.
I hope you can do that.	Nispera li inti tista 'tagħmel dan.
Why does this happen.	Għaliex jiġri dan.
It was someone else.	Kien xi ħadd ieħor.
Not that, either.	Mhux dak, lanqas.
I was only there for three hours or so.	Kont hemmhekk biss tliet sigħat jew hekk.
Come now.	Ejja issa.
And she is with me.	U hi miegħi.
Not too bad, really.	Mhux ħażin wisq, tassew.
It's not good.	M’huwiex tajjeb.
Not good today.	Illum mhux tajjeb.
I’m not trying to do anything.	Jien ma nipprova nagħmel xejn.
As it was not.	Kif ma kienx.
If not, say so.	Jekk le, għid hekk.
Soon there will not be enough.	Dalwaqt ma jkunx hemm biżżejjed.
It was time.	Kien wasal iż-żmien.
And it can’t be otherwise for you.	U ma jistax ikun mod ieħor għalik.
He had to be able to help.	Huwa kellu jkun kapaċi jgħin.
To be with him.	Biex tkun miegħu.
Not this !.	Mhux dan!.
I think this could be the problem.	Naħseb li din tista' tkun il-problema.
He has done this before.	Huwa għamel dan qabel.
I said so.	Jien għidt hekk.
How about this ?.	Kif dwar dan?.
Well, but he wasn’t.	Ukoll, imma hu ma kienx.
Must have one.	Għandu jkollu wieħed.
I just came back home.	Għadni kif ġej lura d-dar.
I'm not sure how to do that.	M'inix ċert kif tagħmel dan.
It must be someone else.	Għandu jkun xi ħadd ieħor.
He knows how to drive.	Jaf isuq.
I will not try this week.	Mhux se nipprova din il-ġimgħa.
It's a little.	Huwa ftit.
That's not as easy as it sounds.	Dak mhux faċli daqs kemm jidher.
Everyone was happy.	Kulħadd kien kuntent.
Now they have it.	Issa għandhom dan.
All of them were very tired.	Kollha kemm huma kienu għajjien ħafna.
Not so great.	Mhux daqshekk kbir.
All of the above.	Kollha ta 'hawn fuq.
We are not supposed to.	Aħna mhux suppost.
I’m not sure how to do that.	M'inix ċert kif tagħmel dan.
He did what he did.	Huwa għamel dak li għamel.
You did a lot for me.	Inti għamilt ħafna għalija.
And he didn’t know.	U ma kienx jaf.
And probably better that he didn't.	U probabbilment aħjar li hu ma.
It's bad.	Huwa ħażin.
Everyone happens to him.	Kulħadd jiġri għalih.
And now, he is gone forever.	U issa, huwa mar għal dejjem.
He had a lot.	Kellu ħafna.
I love you so much.	Jien tant inħobb miegħek.
I wanted to go home.	Ridt immur id-dar.
That wasn’t her.	Dik ma kinitx hi.
Well, whatever.	Ukoll, tkun xi tkun.
Well there you go.	Ukoll hemm inti tmur.
This is my last.	Dan huwa l-aħħar tiegħi.
I always think so and so do you.	Dejjem naħseb hekk u int ukoll.
There's a lot going on around you, you know.	Hemm ħafna minn madwar, taf.
He is your friend.	Huwa ħabib tiegħek.
And now we both have a lot more.	U issa t-tnejn għandna ħafna aktar.
He is like everyone else.	Huwa bħal kulħadd.
You only need to do this once.	Għandek bżonn tagħmel dan darba biss.
I knew he did a few of these things.	Kont naf li għamel ftit minn dawn l-affarijiet.
He could have done that.	Seta’ għamel dan.
You know who we are, now.	Inti taf min aħna, issa.
I would be here.	Jien inkun hawn.
And he wanted to do it properly.	U ried jagħmel dan kif suppost.
Soon it will.	Dalwaqt se.
I have no friends on the outside.	M'għandi l-ebda ħbieb fuq barra.
For me.	Għalija.
I could see he was surprised and happy.	Stajt nara li kien sorpriż u kuntent.
I don’t know much about that time.	Ma nafx ħafna dwar dak iż-żmien.
Nothing else was done about it.	Ma sar xejn ieħor dwarha.
And, of course, it can't be more than a year.	U, ovvjament, ma jistax ikun aktar minn sena.
Not only that.	Mhux hekk biss.
He felt better now.	Huwa ħassu aħjar issa.
This happened once.	Dan ġara darba.
It's not for you.	Hu mhux għalik.
What is.	X'inhu.
I can tell you too.	Nista’ ngħidlek ukoll.
She wasn’t, once.	Hija ma kinitx, darba.
We knew very little about it.	Ma tantx konna nafu dwar dan.
Here you go.	Hawn tmur.
My job is not difficult.	Ix-xogħol tiegħi mhuwiex diffiċli.
I tell you.	Jien ngħidlek.
But maybe they should.	Imma forsi għandhom.
We had one.	Kellna waħda.
This will always get better.	Dan jibqa' dejjem aħjar.
It’s time for me to go too.	Wasal iż-żmien li mmur jien ukoll.
He wanted to say more.	Ried jgħid aktar.
I understand more than you think.	Nifhem aktar milli taħseb.
I had enough.	Kelli biżżejjed.
But now there is a problem.	Imma issa hemm problema.
He says to come tomorrow.	Jgħid biex tiġi għada.
But that doesn’t do it right.	Imma dan ma jagħmilx tajjeb.
He could hope again tomorrow.	Għada seta’ jerġa’ jittama.
It was really good.	Kien tassew tajjeb.
This, be willing to try.	Dan, ikun lest li jipprova.
For the morning.	Għal filgħodu.
But we were.	Imma konna.
Probably just me.	Probabbilment jien biss.
Who knows where it came from?	Min jaf minn fejn ġie?
I'm just at work.	Jien biss fuq xogħol.
But not too long after the first.	Imma mhux wisq żmien wara l-ewwel.
Maybe the only good one.	Forsi l-unika waħda tajba.
He’s pretty good together for what he wants.	Huwa pjuttost tajjeb flimkien għal dak li jrid.
Time does that.	Iż-żmien jagħmel hekk.
I need to think about it.	Għandi bżonn naħseb dwar dan.
I don’t know anyone here.	Ma naf lil ħadd hawn.
They will by something.	Huma se minn xi ħaġa.
If this.	Jekk dan.
That's what everyone had.	Dak kellu kulħadd.
I just can't take it anymore.	I biss ma nistax aktar.
Not like other people.	Mhux bħal nies oħra.
Some time passed.	Għadda ftit ħin.
Sorry, he said.	Jiddispjaċini, qal.
But there shouldn’t be.	Imma m'għandux ikun hemm.
You often do.	Ħafna drabi tagħmel.
And not easy.	U mhux faċli.
Everything was fine.	Kollox kien tajjeb.
She looked over.	Hija ħares fuq.
If there is.	Jekk ikun hemm.
I want you to know.	Irrid li tkun taf.
He was so scared.	Huwa kien tant jibża '.
As long as it was.	Sakemm kien.
I want it so badly.	Irrid hekk ħażin.
Look at the house.	Ħares lejn id-dar.
Says one of ours.	Jgħid wieħed minn tagħna.
But she doesn't want to tell me anything more.	Imma hi ma trid tgħidli xejn aktar.
This takes too long.	Dan jieħu wisq żmien.
He should be happy.	Għandu jkun kuntent.
But no one knows.	Imma ħadd ma jaf.
I listen to everything.	Jien nisma’ kollox.
I didn’t do anything wrong.	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin.
I am much better now.	Jiena ħafna aħjar issa.
I'm not having fun.	M'iniex gost.
You know what you want.	Taf li trid.
Not enough time.	Mhux biżżejjed ħin.
You are my problem.	Int il-problema tiegħi.
It will be here.	Se jkun hawn.
And that’s a bad thing.	U dik hija ħaġa ħażina.
You know what will happen.	Inti taf x'se jiġri.
I will never be ready.	Jien qatt mhu se nkun lest.
Not sure what is going wrong.	Mhux ċert x'inhu sejjer ħażin.
I will not do so.	Jien mhux se nagħmel hekk.
It happens, you know.	Dan jiġri, taf.
You can do anything else.	Tista 'tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
But now not there.	Imma issa mhux hemmhekk.
We spent some time together.	Għamilna ftit ħin flimkien.
And you see that on.	U inti tara li fuq.
This is difficult for so many people.	Dan huwa diffiċli għal tant nies.
They felt like a child.	Ħassu tifel.
Which, of course, happened.	Li, ovvjament, ġara.
This is just one thing.	Din hija ħaġa waħda biss.
It was someone else altogether.	Kien xi ħadd ieħor għal kollox.
I can’t wait to see it all.	Ma nistax nistenna biex nara kollox.
I will not be here.	Jien mhux se nkun hawn.
Tired of waiting here.	Għajjien nistenna hawn.
Here's what happened.	Hawn x'ġara.
I came here to talk to you.	Ġejt hawn biex nitkellem miegħek.
I didn't really know what to say.	Ma kontx verament naf x’se ngħid.
He leaves tomorrow.	Jitlaq għada.
He is a great man.	Huwa raġel kbir.
Not sure what it is.	Mhux ċert x'inhu.
It could, but it wasn't.	Seta’, imma ma kienx.
She seemed to have it all.	Kienet tidher li kellha kollox.
He was very happy to be back home.	Kien kuntent ħafna li mar lura d-dar.
It’s too easy to be any good.	Huwa faċli wisq li tkun xi tajba.
I don’t know anyone like that.	Jien ma naf lil ħadd hekk.
It's pretty easy.	Huwa pjuttost faċli.
This should not happen to anyone.	Dan m'għandux jiġri lil xi ħadd.
It wouldn't be.	Ma kienx ikun.
You may have wanted to keep playing with him.	Jista’ jkun li ridt li jibqa’ jilgħab miegħu.
He's just a man.	Huwa biss raġel.
For a while everything was still.	Għal xi żmien kollox kien għadu.
And it wasn’t good.	U ma kinitx tajba.
It works there too.	Jaħdem hemm ukoll.
I didn’t have to wait.	Ma kellix għalfejn nistenna.
I never went there.	Jien qatt ma mort hemm.
It won’t be fast.	Mhux se jkun malajr.
I was never like that.	Qatt ma kont hekk.
It was hard, but it was good.	Kien diffiċli, imma kien tajjeb.
Come on, you can do this.	Ejja, tista’ tagħmel dan.
And it was almost time for one.	U kien kważi żmien għal wieħed.
It was there last night.	Kien hemm ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
He hadn’t been here before.	Ma kienx hawn qabel.
Or it will do.	Jew se tagħmel.
Good evening.	Illejla tkun tajba.
It doesn't have to be that way.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
He probably does.	Huwa probabbilment jagħmel.
I never thought so.	Jien qatt ma kont naħseb.
I was already good.	Jien diġà kont tajjeb.
I can't believe how good it is for you.	Ma nistax nemmen kemm sejjer tajjeb għalik.
Can I be the first to see it?	Nista' nkun l-ewwel li nara?.
That you can do.	Li inti tista 'tagħmel.
I better have something.	Aħjar ikolli xi ħaġa'.
Only the first.	L-ewwel biss.
I probably never will.	I probabbilment qatt.
They were there.	Kienu hemmhekk.
Sit down and wait.	Poġġa bilqiegħda jistenna.
He is a great man.	Huwa raġel kbir.
That was good, he thought.	Dan kien tajjeb, ħaseb.
I don’t know why really.	Ma nafx għaliex verament.
And it is, really.	U huwa, tassew.
I don’t want to be me.	Ma rridx li nkun jien.
About what comes next.	Dwar dak li jiġi wara.
Maybe it wasn’t so bad to have around.	Forsi ma kienx daqshekk ħażin li jkollu madwar.
You have to make money.	Int trid tagħmel flus.
I have done this a few times.	Dan għamilt xi ftit drabi.
It's here tonight.	Huwa hawn illejla.
That’s not what it says.	Dan mhux dak li jgħid.
Tomorrow morning, boy.	Għada filgħodu, tifel.
I’m not having that.	Jien mhux qed ikolli dak.
I need to do this for everyone.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan għal kulħadd.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
Pretty early in the evening.	Pjuttost kmieni filgħaxija.
It seems we have the same idea.	Jidher li għandna l-istess idea.
No one will know.	Ħadd mhu se jkun jaf.
But he can’t have that.	Imma ma jistax ikollu dan.
You want someone you can count on.	Inti tixtieq xi ħadd li inti tista 'toqgħod fuq.
Really?	Tassew?
But there it was, the same.	Imma hemm kienet, l-istess.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Wasal iż-żmien li tagħmel dan.
I knew better now.	Kont naf aħjar issa.
I'm totally sorry.	Jiddispjaċini għal kollox.
I have a lot of time.	Għandi ħafna ħin.
He doesn't even speak.	Lanqas ma titkellem.
He was ready for it.	Huwa kien lest għal dan.
He should be home by now.	Huwa għandu jkun id-dar sa issa.
This happens, often.	Dan jiġri, spiss.
I know she can.	Naf li hi tista’.
There would never have been a better time.	Qatt ma kien ikun hemm żmien aħjar.
That was it, really.	Hekk kien, tassew.
Was it too fast ?.	Kien malajr wisq?.
But you do it.	Imma int tagħmel dan.
See how it goes.	Tara kif sejjer.
I was sure of that.	Jien kont ċert minn dan.
But not like what you are thinking.	Imma mhux bħal dak li qed taħseb.
Really, really good.	Tassew, tassew tajjeb.
It had to be all that.	Kellu jkun dak kollu.
Who knows what happened.	Min jaf x’ġara.
He was good and really alone.	Kien tajjeb u tassew waħdu.
No, it was better.	Le, kien aħjar.
It will be great.	Se jkun kbir.
But nothing seems to be working.	Imma jidher li xejn qed jaħdem.
No one else can do that.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jagħmel dan.
I didn't know what happened.	Ma kontx naf x’ġara.
I do this often.	Nagħmel dan spiss.
And it shouldn’t go there.	U m'għandux imur hemm.
He said he had something he needed to talk to us about.	Qal li kellu xi ħaġa li kellu bżonn biex jitkellem magħna.
That's how they felt.	Hekk ħassu dan.
Many people do this more than once.	Ħafna nies jagħmlu dan aktar minn darba.
I never had.	Qatt ma kelli.
They have a chance.	Għandhom ċans.
Tell me what you need to say.	Għid dak li għandek bżonn tgħid.
No, this is wrong.	Le, dan huwa ħażin.
I don’t know if this is going to work.	Ma nafx jekk dan hux se jaħdem.
But you don’t have to stand and watch.	Imma m'għandekx għalfejn toqgħod u tara.
I hope to talk to you again soon.	Nispera li nerġa' nitkellem miegħek dalwaqt.
He knows he’s good.	Jaf li hu tajjeb.
And that was really hard for me.	U dan kien verament diffiċli għalija.
He didn’t say why.	Ma kienx jgħid għaliex.
No, it shouldn't.	Le, m'għandux.
This one didn’t have one.	Dan ma kellux wieħed.
Now that will be fun !!.	Issa dak se jkun gost!!.
Not very big.	Mhux kbir ħafna.
But it was too late.	Imma kien tard wisq.
There was nothing there.	Ma kien hemm xejn hemmhekk.
He’s a friend to you, too, you know.	Huwa ħabib għalik, ukoll, taf.
Look at each other.	Ħares lejn xulxin.
I was very tired.	Kont għajjien ħafna.
It will not be easy.	Mhux se jkun faċli.
And sure we are.	U żgur aħna.
I will listen.	Jien se nisma.
Well, you were right.	Ukoll, kellek raġun.
There is never enough.	Qatt m'hemm biżżejjed.
I know what you are thinking.	Naf x'qed taħseb.
I’m not doubting that.	Jien mhux qed niddubita dan.
He is taking a great chance.	Huwa qed jieħu ċans kbir.
For me, eating out is a great thing.	Għalija, li tiekol barra hija ħaġa kbira.
I wasn’t sure if he would.	Ma kontx ċert jekk kieku.
It happens to me a lot.	Jiġri miegħi ħafna.
Maybe for you, it can.	Forsi għalik, jista '.
Let's go there.	Ejja mmorru hemm.
She wants to talk to you.	Hija trid titkellem miegħek.
I can’t tell you how it happened.	Ma nistax ngħidlek kif ġara.
You had to know.	Kellek tkun taf.
A little big.	Ftit kbir.
You have years and years.	Għandek snin u snin.
It would be better that way.	Ikun aħjar hekk.
You could say that.	Tista' tgħid hekk.
Not that he could do much.	Mhux li seta’ jagħmel ħafna.
He couldn't.	Ma setax.
Just so u.	Biss hekk u.
I don’t expect much trouble here.	Jien ma nistenna ħafna problemi hawn.
Every child can talk.	Kull tifel jista’ jitkellem.
Before you go back to your car.	Qabel ma tmur lura lejn il-karozza tiegħek.
If not it will be.	Jekk le se jkun.
And a boy in the back.	U tifel fuq wara.
This we do not need.	Dan m'għandniex bżonn.
More on that later.	Aktar dwar dan aktar tard.
I think that is a very good thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba ħafna.
I have what we need.	Għandi dak li għandna bżonn.
Everyone has the same problem.	Kull min għandu l-istess problema.
This is not beautiful.	Din mhix sabiħa.
I know, I don’t either.	Naf, jien lanqas.
I have no idea how to do any of this.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif nagħmel xi ħaġa minn dan.
You can see this as follows.	Tista 'tara dan kif ġej.
One by one, please let’s.	Wieħed wieħed, jekk jogħġbok ejja.
No one appears.	Ħadd ma jidher.
I thought maybe.	Ħsibt forsi.
Let me try.	Ħa nipprova.
You are for that.	Inti għal dak.
You are you.	Int int.
I really am.	Jien tassew.
I can think of one way.	Kapaċi naħseb mod wieħed.
I should have known for sure.	Kelli nkun naf żgur.
He came to me.	Ġie għandi.
And there was no one else there.	U ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor hemmhekk.
I wonder how much he has, really.	Nistaqsi kemm għandu, tassew.
You'll know pretty soon.	Int tkun taf pjuttost malajr.
Just not today.	Biss mhux illum.
It's the same thing here.	Huwa l-istess ħaġa hawn.
I hope this is better.	Nispera li dan huwa aħjar.
She had to be there.	Kellha tkun hemm.
This had never happened before.	Dan qatt ma kien ġara qabel.
Say you know.	Tgħid li taf.
That was a lot.	Dan kien ħafna.
He really, really, does.	Huwa tassew, tassew, jagħmel.
And this is the same thing.	U din hija l-istess ħaġa.
This wanted a lot.	Dan ried ħafna.
Sure, there must be something.	Żgur, għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa.
And that was supposed to be the case.	U dak suppost kellu jkun hekk.
I enjoy doing things.	Jien nieħu gost nagħmel l-affarijiet.
But it was so much.	Imma kien hekk ħafna.
He went too.	Huwa mar ukoll.
Everyone says so.	Kulħadd jgħid hekk.
This can happen here.	Dan jista 'jiġri hawn.
No one knows what to expect.	Ħadd ma jaf x'għandu jistenna.
He was not surprised at all.	Ma kien sorpriż xejn.
He is a very beautiful person.	Huwa persuna sabiħa ħafna.
This is a quick and easy one.	Din hija waħda ta 'malajr u faċli.
No, you are not.	Le, m'intix.
You're there.	Int hemmhekk.
Not really good, but really bad.	Mhux tassew tajjeb ħafna, imma tassew ħażin ħafna.
I need to try more.	Għandi bżonn nipprova aktar.
Try this.	Ipprova b'dan.
It's really bad.	Huwa tassew ħażin.
I am your very good friend.	Jien ħabib tajjeb ħafna tiegħek.
You never do.	Inti qatt ma tagħmel.
He never wants to see that happen again.	Qatt ma jrid jara hekk jerġa’ jiġri.
Like mine.	Bħal tiegħi.
Say something good.	Għid xi ħaġa tajba.
But we are just.	Imma aħna biss.
You can't do anything.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel xejn.
He left shortly after.	Telaq ftit wara.
I can say that.	Jien nista' ngħid hekk.
Well, there is only one thing.	Ukoll, hemm ħaġa waħda biss.
I really think this is going to be great.	Verament naħseb li dan se jkun kbir.
He was waiting for me to do this better.	Huwa kien qed jistenna lili nagħmel dan aħjar.
Or maybe it was this.	Jew forsi kien dan.
It was done quickly.	Sar malajr.
But he plays too fast.	Imma jilgħab malajr wisq.
He is truly a great man.	Huwa tassew raġel kbir.
And we were just sitting there.	U konna biss bilqiegħda hemm.
You’re taking it all wrong.	Int qed tieħu dan kollu ħażin.
Not one single person.	Mhux persuna waħda waħda.
It will take some time.	Se jieħu ftit żmien.
But you go first.	Imma inti tmur l-ewwel.
She had to say something.	Kellha tgħid xi ħaġa.
I can’t do anything about it.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn dwarha.
This wasn’t going to be a big deal.	Dan ma kellux ikun xi ħaġa kbira.
He was ready, and he was capable.	Kien lest, u kien kapaċi.
There may be another.	Jista’ jkun hemm ieħor.
I couldn’t believe it, but she was right.	Ma stajtx nemmen, imma kellha raġun.
It couldn’t be.	Ma setax ikun.
Not what you think.	Mhux dak li taħseb.
And it wasn’t done.	U mhux sar.
Good for him.	Tajjeb għalih.
Not that you need.	Mhux li għandek bżonn.
I don't know how it could have happened.	Ma nafx kif seta’ ġara.
And work is work.	U xogħol huwa xogħol.
Same as I was.	L-istess kif kont.
He wanted to stay out.	Ried jibqa’ barra.
Not that he was expecting any.	Mhux li kien jistenna xi.
She just had to.	Hija biss kellha.
Tired, it's mine.	Għajjien, huwa tiegħi.
Neither is he, it seems.	Lanqas hu, milli jidher.
Maybe more than that.	Forsi aktar minn hekk.
Everyone seems to be doing almost the same thing.	Kulħadd jidher li qed jagħmel kważi l-istess.
He is the last one to come.	Huwa l-aħħar wieħed li daħal.
Why, we can do something.	Għaliex, nistgħu nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
It’s ready for me.	Huwa lest għalija.
To be sure.	Biex tkun ċert.
And it looked great.	U ħares kbira.
I can tell you right.	Nista’ ngħidlek tajjeb.
Before you go.	Qabel ma tmur.
She wants to be out.	Hija trid tkun barra.
But it wasn’t just him.	Imma ma kienx hu biss.
I thought he needed some help.	Ħsibt li kellu bżonn jieħu xi għajnuna.
You know how that was.	Taf kif kien dak.
You can.	Tista.
I do that.	Jiena nagħmel dan.
He knows that.	Hu jaf li.
There was no one else around.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor madwar.
She had a son with him.	Hija kellha tifel miegħu.
They were all there.	Kollha kienu hemm.
But she needed to know more.	Imma kellha bżonn tkun taf aktar.
No one else did.	Ħadd ieħor ma għamel.
I'm really not.	Jien verament mhux.
I'm still there.	Għadni hemm.
But everything looked good, everything looked good.	Imma kollox deher tajjeb, kollox deher tajjeb.
I wanted to sit there and stay you.	Jien ridt noqgħod hemm u noqgħod int.
And I didn’t know.	U ma kontx taf.
This is what they are after.	Dan huwa dak li huma wara.
I really wasn’t sure.	Verament ma kontx ċert.
Nobody knows where he is.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn hu.
I think otherwise.	Naħseb mod ieħor.
Well, that’s what it says here.	Ukoll, dan huwa dak li jgħid hawn.
No one was here.	Ħadd ma kien hawn.
He is a good man.	Huwa raġel tajjeb.
That’s bad enough.	Dak huwa ħażin biżżejjed.
All may be never.	Kollha jista' jkun qatt.
I believe it was the truth she was telling me.	Jien nemmen li kienet il-verità li kienet qed tgħidli.
What was happening was really coming to him.	Dak li kien qed jiġri kien verament qed jasal għalih.
Work can wait.	Ix-xogħol jista’ jistenna.
There may be a way.	Jista 'jkun hemm mod.
Just what he needed.	Biss dak li kellu bżonn.
I'm going like that.	Jien sejjer hekk.
That's too long.	Dak huwa twil wisq.
Nothing helps.	Xejn jgħin.
Here for you, boy.	Hawn għalik, tifel.
Some people not so much.	Xi nies mhux daqshekk.
In fact, nothing but.	Fil-fatt, xejn imma.
Someone better do something soon.	Xi ħadd aħjar jagħmel xi ħaġa dalwaqt.
It is something else.	Hija xi ħaġa oħra.
He left.	Huwa telaq.
I will not be here in the morning.	Jien mhux se nkun hawn filgħodu.
I hadn’t thought about it at the time.	Jien ma ħsibt xejn dwarha dak iż-żmien.
But this was not too often.	Imma dan ma kienx wisq spiss.
Well, that was something.	Ukoll, dik kienet xi ħaġa.
We don’t have time for this now.	M'għandniex il-ħin għal dan issa.
I was surprised.	Kont sorpriż.
I only heard what you heard.	Smajt biss dak li smajt int.
That was just work for him.	Dak kien biss xogħol għalih.
This works well.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb.
All of us.	Tagħna kollha.
I was never happy.	Qatt ma kont kuntent.
But we can't.	Imma nistgħu le.
Or were they.	Jew kienu.
It looked good.	Deher tajjeb.
I wanted to tell you.	Ridt ngħidlek.
I thought about that one.	Ħsibt dwar dak wieħed.
how beautiful she was.	kemm kienet sabiħa.
They felt better.	Ħassu aħjar.
That's what everyone did.	Hekk għamel kulħadd.
But most likely no one will.	Imma x'aktarx ħadd ma se.
Where do you live?	Fejn toqgħod?
She was always there for us.	Kienet dejjem hemm għalina.
I think about here.	Naħseb dwar hawn.
It’s not that hard really.	Mhuwiex daqshekk diffiċli verament.
And so has everyone.	U hekk għandu kulħadd.
Maybe this can work.	Forsi dan jista 'jaħdem.
They’re not just doing it.	Huma mhux qed jagħmlu dan biss.
It’s definitely better to be both.	Huwa żgur aħjar li tkun it-tnejn.
No, it's just.	Le, huwa biss.
It hadn’t happened.	Ma kienx ġara.
I know it wasn’t easy.	Naf li ma kienx faċli.
But better.	Imma aħjar.
It can take quite a while, of course.	Jista 'jieħu żmien mhux ħażin, ovvjament.
You are here now.	Int hawn issa.
Not hard for me.	Mhux diffiċli għalija.
Well, we can for a while.	Ukoll, nistgħu għal xi żmien.
I want to see.	Irrid nara.
I don't have a car.	M'għandix karozza.
Well, he never seemed to want to much.	Tajjeb, qatt ma deher li ried għal ħafna.
Not too much chance of that.	Mhux wisq ċans ta 'dak.
I never made time.	Qatt ma għamilt il-ħin.
Everything is still, now.	Kollox għadu, issa.
Where no one could see.	Fejn ħadd ma seta’ jara.
At the time it seemed like a lot.	Dak iż-żmien deher li kien ħafna.
They have it there.	Huma għandhom hemmhekk.
I don’t want to understand.	Ma rridx nifhem.
Very good !.	Tajjeb ħafna!.
I won't eat either.	Lanqas se niekol.
Now she never knew why.	Issa qatt ma kienet tkun taf għaliex.
But he couldn’t, yet he didn’t.	Imma ma setax, għadu mhux.
I love everything you do.	Inħobb dak kollu li tagħmel.
I wanted it to happen.	Jien ridt li jiġri.
He would have to think about it for a long time.	Kien ikollu jaħseb dwar dan għal żmien twil.
No one else can either.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ lanqas.
You would be great.	Int tkun kbir.
He said he had.	Qal li kellu.
Or so you think.	Jew hekk taħseb.
We know fast enough.	Nafu malajr biżżejjed.
And so it will.	U hekk se.
Did you know?	Kont int?.
By then it would be too late.	Sa dak iż-żmien ikun tard wisq.
Very good.	Tajjeb ħafna.
It's about having fun.	Huwa dwar li tieħu gost.
Mine can wait.	Tiegħi jista’ jistenna.
She knows, of course.	Hija taf, ovvjament.
Maybe that.	Forsi dak.
I want to know everything about it.	Irrid inkun naf kollox dwarha.
I had to listen.	Kelli nisma’.
There really is only one person that this can be.	Hemm verament persuna waħda biss li dan jista 'jkun.
This I never knew, until recently.	Dan qatt ma kont naf, sa ftit ilu.
Not just my job.	Mhux ix-xogħol tiegħi biss.
She had had a good time with him.	Kienet kellha ħin tajjeb miegħu.
I didn’t know anything.	Jien ma kont naf xejn.
Today, there is a lot of money.	Illum, , hemm ħafna flus.
Same with us.	L-istess magħna.
He was.	Hu kien.
It's my job.	Huwa xogħol tiegħi.
I’m happy for him.	Jien kuntent għalih.
He doesn’t need one.	M'għandux bżonn wieħed.
I don’t want it to come.	Ma rridx li jiġi.
There is enough for everyone.	Hemm biżżejjed għal kulħadd.
It was going well.	Kien sejjer tajjeb.
The first way.	L-ewwel mod.
You know, something so beautiful.	Taf, xi ħaġa hekk sabiħa.
He didn’t want anything to go wrong tonight.	Ma ried li xejn imur ħażin illejla.
But that's not the case.	Imma dak mhux hekk.
As someone said, he’s not.	Kif qal xi ħadd, hu mhux.
We don’t have to do that here.	M'għandniex għalfejn nagħmlu hekk hawn.
It was about everything.	Kien dwar kollox.
I didn’t want to hear any more.	Ma ridtx nisma aktar.
He knows when.	Hu jaf meta jkun.
That's the way it is.	Hekk huma l-affarijiet.
It has always been so.	Dejjem kienet hekk.
If that was something you worried about.	Jekk dik kienet xi ħaġa li int inkwetat dwarha.
Soon he couldn’t.	Dalwaqt ma setax.
If so it would happen this afternoon or evening.	Kieku hekk kien se jiġri llum wara nofsinhar jew illejla.
I’m not trying.	Jien mhux qed nipprova.
There is no other way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor.
Had she had, perhaps she would never have left.	Kieku kellha, forsi qatt ma telaq.
I want to hear more about where it comes from.	Irrid nisma aktar dwar minn fejn ġej.
You are not thinking about what you are doing.	M'intix qed taħseb dwar dak li qed tagħmel.
I can’t be sure.	Ma nistax inkun ċert.
I want to be here.	Irrid inkun hawn.
Now, he is worried.	Issa, huwa inkwetat.
It is not.	Mhuwiex.
I don't know what he's doing.	Ma nafx x’qed jagħmel.
He didn’t have to do that either.	Ma kellux jagħmel dan lanqas.
That had to be what we had to do.	Dak kellu jkun dak li kellna nagħmlu.
I think it probably will.	Naħseb li probabbilment se.
At the back.	Fuq wara.
I understand what you are saying.	Nifhem dak li qed tgħid.
She knew how to do it.	Kienet taf kif tagħmel dan.
You're home.	Int id-dar.
They do it.	Huma jagħmlu dan.
And you'll be better off too.	U int tkun aħjar ukoll.
It was taking a long time to play as before.	Kien qed jieħu ħafna ħin biex jilgħab bħal qabel.
And this is a good thing.	U din hija ħaġa tajba.
I want to hear what he has to say.	Irrid nisma’ x’għandu xi jgħid dwarha.
I doubt that’s the only one.	Niddubita li dik hija l-unika waħda.
That's good enough.	Dan huwa tajjeb biżżejjed.
I really think my friend was right.	Verament naħseb li ħabib tiegħi kellu raġun.
I watch this all the time.	Nara dan il-ħin kollu.
I know it’s not me.	Naf li mhux jien.
He did what he did.	Huwa għamel dak li għamel.
This is not how it works.	Dan mhux kif jaħdem.
I don’t know for how long.	Ma nafx għal kemm żmien.
They have little money.	Għandhom ftit flus.
This may be time consuming.	Dan jista' jkun qed jagħmel il-ħin.
Or my job.	Jew ix-xogħol tiegħi.
But other people will not.	Imma nies oħra mhux se.
It eats almost everything.	Jiekol kważi kollox.
He had to sit down.	Kellu toqgħod bilqiegħda.
That's a lot.	Dan huwa ħafna.
Everything is as before.	Kollox huwa bħal qabel.
There is much more to see tomorrow.	Għada jkun hemm ħafna aktar x'tara.
We are many.	Aħna ħafna.
We’ve never had this before.	Qatt ma kellna dan qabel.
Maybe he did.	Forsi hekk għamel.
He wanted to see.	Ried jara.
He didn't know what else to do.	Ma kienx jaf x’kien aktar.
From there now.	Minn hemm issa.
Why not money ?.	Għaliex ma flus?.
He was not talking to anyone.	L-ebda mod ma kien qed jitkellem ma’ ħadd.
Little in fact.	Ftit fil-fatt.
How will you do the same ?.	Kif se tagħmel l-istess?.
Maybe it was.	Forsi kien.
You have to do it.	Għandek tagħmel dan.
It shouldn't happen that way.	M'għandux jiġri hekk.
Where is my fault.	Fejn hu ħażin tiegħi.
And so we did.	U hekk għamilna.
Let's go back.	Ejja mmorru lura.
You stay there.	Inti toqgħod hemm.
All about the dog.	Kollha dwar il-kelb.
We can be better than that.	Nistgħu nkunu aħjar minn hekk.
I was scared too.	Jien ukoll kont nibża’.
I know you're there.	Naf li int hemm.
Here it is!	Hawn hi!
That said.	Dak li qal.
Like yours, here.	Bħal tiegħek, hawn.
I never said that.	Qatt ma kont għidt hekk.
She is very beautiful.	Hija sabiħa ħafna.
She could be anyone.	Hija tista 'tkun xi ħadd.
But he was right all the time.	Imma kien kellu raġun il-ħin kollu.
Can anyone please do this.	Jista' xi ħadd jekk jogħġbok jagħmel dan.
Probably there too.	Probabbilment hemm ukoll.
Maybe they do.	Forsi jagħmlu.
This, more and more.	Dan, aktar u aktar.
He never wanted to.	Hu qatt ma ried.
My friend is here.	Ħabib tiegħi qiegħed hawn.
I couldn’t speak.	Ma stajtx nitkellem.
He said.	Hu qal .
There should be only you there.	Għandu jkun hemm biss int hemmhekk.
You know we used to be friends.	Taf li konna nkunu ħbieb.
Because of course it is.	Għaliex ovvjament huwa.
It's just not there.	Huwa biss mhux hemm.
But we don't have to.	Imma m’għandniex għalfejn.
I like it.	Jien inħobb.
I know.	Naf.
It is now or never !.	Huwa issa jew qatt!.
That's what he told me.	Dan huwa dak li qalli.
Everything goes so fast.	Kollox imur hekk malajr.
She knows nothing, it seems.	Hija ma taf xejn, jidher.
This happens so often.	Dan jiġri hekk spiss.
A little bit.	Ftit ftit.
She had been doing this for too long.	Hija kienet għamlet dan għal żmien twil wisq.
I will go to him.	Jien se mmur għandu.
I thought.	Kont ħsibt.
But that was not all.	Imma dan ma kienx kollox.
It was really bad.	Kien tassew ħażin.
Nobody has.	Ħadd ma għandu.
This is your problem.	Din il-problema tiegħek.
That was what he was going to do.	Dak kien se jagħmel.
I'll tell you when.	Jien ngħidlek meta.
Nothing else happened, really.	Ma ġara xejn ieħor, tassew.
Time is everything.	Iż-żmien huwa kollox.
Our only child.	L-uniku tifel tagħna.
Still.	Għadha.
It looks really good.	Jidher tajjeb tassew.
Maybe, a little.	Forsi, ftit.
She did, really.	Hija għamlet, tassew.
Or he didn’t have to.	Jew ma kellux.
From this you can be pretty sure.	Minn dan tista' tkun pjuttost ċert.
It was the book, of course, but there was more.	Kien il-ktieb, ovvjament, imma kien hemm aktar.
Friend.	Ħabib.
But he had never thought about it.	Imma qatt ma kien ħaseb dwar dan.
Why not? ' 	Għaliex le?'
But it looks good.	Imma jidher tajjeb.
We know more now than we did before.	Nafu aktar issa milli konna qabel.
He will be fine.	Hu se jkun tajjeb.
I did my job and he did his.	Jien għamilt ix-xogħol tiegħi u hu għamel tiegħu.
And everything works fine.	U kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
So they are.	Hekk huma.
He couldn't help it.	Ma setax jgħin.
More and more and more.	Aktar u aktar u aktar.
It works for me.	Jaħdem għalija.
And so it was.	U hekk sar.
Well, you can actually do that.	Ukoll, inti fil-fatt tista 'tagħmel dan.
Well nothing more.	Ukoll xejn aktar.
You were very good!	Int kont tajjeb ħafna!
That's what happened here.	Hekk ġara hawn.
I didn't want to see anyone.	Ma ridt nara lil ħadd.
But he couldn't help it.	Imma ma setax jgħin.
I would like to know what happens.	Nixtieq inkun naf x'inhu jiġri.
He had to live with that.	Huwa kellu jgħix ma 'dak.
That’s good for us.	Dak hu tajjeb magħna.
I would like to know why.	Nixtieq inkun naf għaliex.
And good for me.	U tajjeb għalija.
Just not, person.	Biss le, persuna.
Maybe he should have.	Forsi kellu jkollu.
He was quite my friend.	Kien pjuttost ħabib tiegħi.
Not again.	Mhux mill-ġdid.
I'm glad you're better.	Jien kuntent li int aħjar.
I knew it wasn’t right.	Kont naf li ma kienx tajjeb.
It seemed easy.	Huwa deher faċli.
It's easy.	Huwa faċli.
I wasn’t having that.	Ma kontx qed ikolli hekk.
And that was bad too.	U dan kien ħażin ukoll.
And they will do anything you want.	U se jagħmlu xi ħaġa li trid.
He saw nothing.	Ma ra xejn .
That was great.	Dan kien kbir.
Everything we can do.	Dak kollu nistgħu nagħmlu.
But nothing more than that.	Imma xejn aktar minn hekk.
We have time.	Għandna ħin.
I was very happy that.	Kont kuntent ħafna li.
They have a lot.	Għandhom ħafna.
Really, she is.	Tassew, hi.
I didn’t know any of that at the time.	Dak iż-żmien ma kont naf xejn minn dan.
That was usually everyone.	Li normalment kien kulħadd.
I don’t have to do that.	M'għandix għalfejn nagħmel dan.
I hope that happens soon.	Nispera li jiġri dalwaqt.
Nor does it appear.	Lanqas jidher.
But no.	Imma le.
Not much, maybe.	Mhux ħafna, forsi.
No one else was in the back.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien fuq wara.
I never knew it was so big.	Qatt ma kont naf li kien daqshekk kbir.
Just don't do it.	Biss ma tagħmel dan.
I have fun.	Jien nieħu gost.
Not as good as you think.	Mhux tajjeb kif taħseb.
That's it, more or less.	Dak hu, xi ftit jew wisq.
And nothing is going to happen.	U xejn mhu sejjer.
I saw that it was too late.	Rajt li kien tard wisq.
Not you either.	Mhux int ukoll.
And when you do, it gets easier.	U meta tagħmel dan, ix-xogħol isir aktar faċli.
We didn’t do much work yesterday.	Ma tantx għamilna xogħol ilbieraħ.
Not fast enough.	Mhux malajr biżżejjed.
I don't like it.	Jien ma nħobbx.
It was my first job.	Kien l-ewwel xogħol tiegħi.
That time is back.	Dak iż-żmien huwa lura.
You must be tired.	Trid tkun għajjien.
I want a man.	Irrid raġel.
There was before and after.	Kien hemm qabel u wara.
I don’t know why, it’s just.	Ma nafx għaliex, huwa biss.
Did you see what she did?	Rajt dak li għamlet?
This will not happen here.	Dan mhux se jiġri hawn.
I didn’t know there was such a thing.	Ma kontx naf li kien hemm xi ħaġa bħal din.
Not good, maybe.	Mhux tajjeb, forsi.
I thought maybe I was gone.	Ħsibt li forsi kont mort.
Look at this.	Ħares lejn dan.
Maybe he's right.	Forsi għandu raġun.
Never ever ever.	Qatt qatt qatt.
He said she wants it so much better.	Qal li hi tixtieq hekk aħjar.
Today he was doing a lot of things.	Illum kien qed jagħmel ħafna affarijiet.
And eat with other people.	U tiekol ma nies oħra.
You have to be.	Għandek tiġi.
We will not go back.	Mhux se mmorru lura.
It was great too.	Kien kbir ukoll.
You've done more.	Inti stajt tagħmel aktar.
He was not surprised.	Ma kienx sorpriż.
He was hoping for more.	Huwa kien jittama għal aktar.
Obviously, there is but great.	Ovvjament, hemm imma kbira.
I was right.	Jien kont raġun.
This is much better.	Dan huwa ħafna aħjar.
But it’s so hard for me.	Imma huwa tant diffiċli għalija.
He was right about one thing.	Kellu raġun dwar ħaġa waħda.
This is what you need.	Dan huwa dak li għandek bżonn.
I want to know what happened there.	Irrid inkun naf x’ġara hemmhekk.
He started saying something.	Beda jgħid xi ħaġa.
Where will you go now.	Fejn se tmur issa.
So he was eating.	Hekk kien qed jiekol.
This you can do.	Dan inti tista 'tagħmel.
It could have been better.	Seta’ kien aħjar.
And be happy to wait right here.	U jkun kuntent li jistenna eżatt hawn.
He looked better tonight.	Huwa deher aħjar illejla.
You don't have to do everything yourself.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel kollox waħdek.
Obviously nothing was happening.	Ovvjament ma kien qed jiġri xejn.
I have no idea what's going on.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'qed jiġri.
It was obviously too long.	Ovvjament kien twil wisq.
There was really nothing to see.	Verament ma kien hemm xejn x’tara.
You can see more of his work at.	Tista 'tara aktar xogħol tiegħu fuq.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.	Jien ċert li se jkun hawn dalwaqt.
One is obviously a very bad job.	Wieħed huwa ovvjament xogħol ħażin ħafna.
What will you do?	X'se tagħmel?
If it’s nothing, that’s it.	Jekk mhu xejn, huwa dak.
That's a lot.	Dak huwa ħafna.
The same can happen here.	L-istess jista' jiġri hawn.
I went there years ago.	Mort hemm snin ilu.
You know how she is.	Taf kif hi.
It's never easy.	Qatt mhu faċli.
But he had many friends.	Imma kellu ħafna ħbieb.
Come on, boy.	Ejja, tifel.
I didn't know anyone here.	Ma kont taf lil ħadd hawn.
He doesn’t want to talk.	Ma jridx jitkellem.
You’re taking a little more this week.	Qed tieħu ftit aktar din il-ġimgħa.
She needed money.	Hija kellha bżonn flus.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx.
That never happened.	Dak qatt ma ġara.
I want to know what happened next.	Irrid inkun naf x’ġara wara.
He only has me.	Huwa għandu lili biss.
A little more.	Ftit aktar.
If you have time.	Jekk għandek ħin.
It will be difficult.	Se jkun diffiċli.
Not once.	Mhux darba waħda.
How long does this take.	Ħin kemm dan jieħu.
Any way to do that ?.	Xi mod kif tagħmel dan?.
They were too much.	Kienu wisq.
It was really, really hard.	Kien tassew, tassew diffiċli.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
Please, let's.	Jekk jogħġbok, ejja.
Much better than before.	Ħafna aħjar minn qabel.
You can't talk to him.	Ma tistax titkellem miegħu.
This is what we need.	Dan huwa dak li għandna bżonn.
I thought you knew so too.	Ħsibt li int taf hekk ukoll.
But we really never know how much time we have.	Imma tassew qatt ma nafu kemm għandna ħin.
That's what happened.	Hekk ġara.
Just never again.	Biss qatt aktar.
And it is working very well.	U qed jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
Like, so it is.	Bħal, hekk hu.
I didn’t want to ask.	Ma ridtx nistaqsi.
Now more than ever.	Issa aktar minn qatt qabel.
It was useless to talk to him about it.	Ma kien ta’ xejn li nitkellem miegħu dwar dan.
If there is nothing more.	Jekk m'hemm xejn aktar.
Well, almost everything.	Ukoll, kważi kollox.
Are you sure that was enough?	Int ċert li kien biżżejjed?
But now ready.	Imma issa lest.
Hardly anyone can.	Kważi ħadd ma jista’.
This will not be difficult for me.	Dan mhux se jkun diffiċli għalija.
And so he had.	U hekk kellu.
I don’t want to listen.	Ma rridx nisma.
This couldn’t really be happening.	Dan ma setax verament qed jiġri.
She did wrong, not me.	Hija għamlet ħażin, mhux jien.
But he knew she did.	Imma hu kien jaf li hi għamlet.
Who they are.	Min huma.
Things happen there.	Jiġri l-affarijiet hemmhekk.
To do something is something.	Li tagħmel xi ħaġa hija xi ħaġa.
Very so.	Ħafna hekk.
And she says.	U hi tgħid.
I had no idea how to do it today.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea kif nagħmel illum.
He doesn’t know where he’s going.	Ma jafx fejn sejjer.
Now it was much more than that.	Issa kien ħafna aktar minn hekk.
Usually she can't.	Normalment hi ma tistax.
Can we do this ?.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan?.
Now he was gone.	Issa kien telaq.
There was too much money.	Kien hemm wisq flus.
I will not do that.	Jien mhux se nagħmel hekk.
You know why this was.	Taf għaliex dan kien.
You may not even know it exists.	Jista’ jkun li lanqas biss tkun taf li hemm.
We never do that now.	Qatt ma nagħmlu hekk issa.
You want my help.	Trid l-għajnuna tiegħi.
It seemed to be.	Deher li kien.
And everything works.	U kollox jaħdem.
And he was the only one he knew.	U kien l-uniku wieħed li kien jaf.
And, for a while, that was enough.	U, għal xi żmien, kien biżżejjed.
I try not to think.	Nipprova ma naħsibx.
I would say that is wrong.	Jien ngħid li huwa ħażin.
But it has to be done !.	Imma jrid isir!.
It doesn't have to be that way.	M'għandux ikun hekk.
He was big enough to drive	Huwa kien kbir biżżejjed biex isuq
I was happy.	Kont kuntent.
No, that's not a problem.	Le, dik mhix problema.
It’s not much, he thought.	Mhuwiex ħafna, ħaseb.
I would be here to listen.	Jien inkun hawn biex nisma.
That was the only thing he wasn’t going to do.	Dik kienet l-unika ħaġa li ma kienx se jagħmel.
It's about her.	Huwa dwarha.
But say or do nothing.	Imma tgħid jew tagħmel xejn.
You're home now.	Int id-dar tiegħek issa.
I have a better idea.	Għandi idea aħjar.
Maybe she was.	Forsi kienet kienet.
I just want you to think about it with me.	Irrid biss li taħseb dwar dan miegħi.
Now he asked why he thought he could.	Issa staqsa għaliex kien ħaseb li jista’.
I was nothing and I had nothing.	Jien ma kont xejn u ma kelli xejn.
We always do that.	Dejjem nagħmlu dan.
I was able to do that.	I kien kapaċi nagħmel dan.
There is no work.	M'hemm l-ebda xogħol.
We know he is a good man.	Nafu li hu raġel tajjeb.
Things you can’t take back.	Affarijiet li ma tistax tieħu lura.
It was difficult for me.	Għalija kien diffiċli.
Like.	Bħal.
I'm going home.	Jien se mmur id-dar.
But nothing you do.	Imma xejn ma tagħmel.
Not one thing.	Mhux ħaġa waħda.
This week is going to be really good.	Din il-ġimgħa se tkun tassew tajba.
Nobody says anything.	Ħadd ma jgħid xejn.
But that was not enough.	Imma dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
I'm glad to know.	Jien ferħan li naf.
My son.	Tifel tiegħi.
No this was more.	Le dan kien aktar.
A chance outside, as you can tell.	Ċans barra, kif tista’ tgħid.
He says that, one day, he will have a car.	Jgħid li, xi darba, se jkollu karozza.
I would be the first to do that.	Inkun l-ewwel li nagħmel dan.
Not like here.	Mhux bħal hawn.
And she knew it too.	U kienet taf ukoll.
I expect a little more.	Nistenna ftit aktar.
he said.	hu qal.
This is definitely wrong.	Dan żgur huwa ħażin.
So it is today.	Hekk hu llum.
Until the end.	Sa l-aħħar.
I have never seen anyone.	Qatt ma rajt lil ħadd.
You know, that’s nothing.	Taf, li mhu xejn.
I'll see who I am.	Jien ser nara li jien.
This dog loves to play.	Dan il-kelb iħobb jilgħab.
I thought you would think so.	Ħsibt li inti taħseb hekk.
I want to be me.	Irrid inkun jien.
Quick, and very.	Malajr, u ħafna.
I just happened upon where it was being done.	I biss ġara fuq fejn kien qed isir.
Currently not the time.	Bħalissa mhux iż-żmien.
It's not even a little.	Hu lanqas ftit.
I can’t go any further than that.	Ma nistax immur aktar minn hekk.
Everyone seems to have someone.	Kulħadd jidher li għandu xi ħadd.
His time can be good.	Il-ħin tiegħu jista 'jkun tajjeb.
I go there.	Jien immur hemm.
There are times when you.	Hemm drabi meta int.
And he thought everything was great.	U ħaseb li kollox kien kbir.
How to do it.	Kif tagħmel dan.
You will be surprised.	Int tkun sorpriż.
He has something for everything.	Għandu xi ħaġa għal kollox.
Like here something.	Bħal hawn xi ħaġa.
Which is what he did.	Li huwa dak li għamel.
Why not now ?.	Għaliex le issa?.
This is very good.	Dan huwa tajjeb ħafna.
I'm a good boy.	Jien tifel tajjeb.
He needed to know what was going on.	Kellu jkun jaf x’qed jiġri.
That has never happened before.	Dak qatt ma ġara qabel.
Looks like we were always here.	Qisu dejjem konna hawn.
I don't know where he is.	Ma nafx fejn hu.
This for you first.	Dan għalik l-ewwel.
He went with that.	Huwa mar ma 'dak.
It will not stay.	Mhux se jibqa’.
I'm not good.	Jien mhux tajjeb.
You have to say something nice back.	Għandek tgħid xi ħaġa sabiħa lura.
In addition, there is a problem.	Barra minn hekk, hemm problema.
And they were mine now.	U kienu tiegħi issa.
You're the problem here.	Int il-problema hawn.
All the time.	Il-ħin kollu.
But there was only me.	Imma kien hemm jien biss.
There is no problem there.	M'hemm l-ebda problema hemmhekk.
He wanted to know the time.	Ried ikun jaf il-ħin.
There it was, I did so.	Kien hemm, għamilt hekk.
I know people you know.	Naf nies li taf.
I just hope to be so good someday.	Nispera biss li xi darba nkun daqshekk tajjeb.
I thought it might be so.	Ħsibt li jista 'jkun hekk.
I was, of course, above all else.	Jien, ovvjament, kont fuq kollox.
This should work, please try.	Dan għandu jaħdem, jekk jogħġbok ipprova.
They are all over here.	Huma kollha fuq hawn.
I need to do this.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan.
It’s just for me.	Huwa biss għalija.
I'm afraid this is it.	Nibża li dan hu.
He was telling the truth.	Kien qed jgħid il-verità.
But there really is no way to tell.	Imma verament m'hemm l-ebda mod biex ngħid.
But here, nothing.	Imma hawn, xejn.
We will definitely be back !.	Żgur se nkunu lura!.
For someone to come and help.	Biex xi ħadd jiġi u jgħin.
You can see why.	Tista 'tara għaliex.
To know that you are here.	Biex tkun taf li int hawn.
I'm waiting.	Qed nistenna.
It didn’t have to be.	Ma kellux ikun.
You did everything.	Inti għamilt dak kollu.
Not so good.	Mhux daqshekk tajjeb.
It was so good.	Kienet tajba ħafna hekk.
I need to do something.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa.
He died some years ago.	Miet xi snin ilu.
You were great.	Int kont kbir.
I'm not so sure about that.	Jien mhux daqshekk ċert minn dan.
Definitely we did.	Żgur li għamilna.
For you.	Għalik.
How much.	Kemm.
It's going well.	Huwa sejjer tajjeb.
They are what they are.	Huma dak li huma.
I just need someone here for me.	Għandi bżonn biss xi ħadd hawn għalija.
I want to know.	Irrid inkun naf.
So it seems.	Hekk jidher.
I’m just about the only one who ever does.	Jien biss dwar l-unika waħda li qatt tagħmel.
And it really works.	U tassew jaħdem.
I'm home now.	Jien id-dar issa.
If you're sure.	Jekk int żgur.
Or is there another easier way.	Jew hemm mod ieħor aktar faċli.
And if we want to go, we must do so soon.	U jekk irridu mmorru, irridu nagħmlu hekk dalwaqt.
This is what will happen.	Dan huwa dak li se jiġri.
I want to know for sure.	Irrid inkun naf ċert.
But not really.	Imma mhux verament.
We will go back to my house.	Se mmorru lura d-dar tiegħi.
I will think about it.	Se naħseb dwarha.
Everyone knows who you are.	Kulħadd jaf min int.
But he knew he would not.	Imma kien jaf li ma kienx se.
And that’s about it.	U dan huwa dwar dan.
What came next is.	Dak li ġie wara hu.
We can be fast.	Nistgħu nkunu malajr.
I know what you are capable of.	Naf dak li int kapaċi.
It doesn't look like that.	Ma jidhirx hekk.
I had a husband and he was a good man.	Kelli raġel u kien raġel tajjeb.
It turned out pretty well.	Ħareġ pjuttost tajjeb.
Now we do everything together.	Issa nagħmlu kollox flimkien.
There was a time when she would say what you think.	Kien hemm żmien meta kienet tgħid dak li taħseb.
That went well.	Dak mar tajjeb.
And that usually works well enough.	U dan normalment jaħdem tajjeb biżżejjed.
he asked.	staqsa.
It may be as you say.	Jista 'jkun li huwa kif tgħid.
It was home.	Kienet id-dar.
There he is.	Hemm hu.
There is always more.	Dejjem hemm aktar.
I said no.	Jien għedt le.
Everyone should eat.	Kulħadd għandu jiekol.
She says she does.	Hija tgħid li tagħmel.
And that’s not good at all.	U dan mhu tajjeb għal kollox.
That we can be friends.	Li nistgħu nkunu ħbieb.
Look at that.	Ħares lejn dak.
The first thing tomorrow.	L-ewwel ħaġa għada.
Loved, loved, loved.	Iħobb, iħobb, iħobb.
I was young at the time.	Jien kont żgħir dak iż-żmien.
I saw that one.	Rajt dak wieħed.
It may be later today.	Jista 'jkun aktar tard illum.
He had to know better.	Huwa kellu jkun jaf aħjar.
I had to try.	Kelli nipprova.
It could be something else.	Jista 'jkun xi ħaġa oħra.
There is so much more to us.	Hemm ħafna aktar għalina.
Or he probably couldn’t.	Jew probabbilment ma setax.
I'm as busy as ever.	Jien okkupat daqs qatt qabel.
It was taking too long.	Kien qed jieħu wisq żmien.
What is never seen is never seen.	Dak li qatt jidher qatt ma jidher.
She is beautiful.	Hija sabiħa.
Time.	Ħin.
I may not.	I jista 'ma.
It took a long, long time.	Huwa ħa ħafna, żmien twil.
This is really hard for me.	Dan huwa verament diffiċli għalija.
Much more than outside.	Ħafna aktar minn barra.
He didn't want to.	Ma riedx.
This helps.	Dan jgħin.
And that's all about it.	U dan huwa dak kollu dwar.
They do what they do and we do what we do.	Huma jagħmlu dak li jagħmlu u aħna nagħmlu dak li nagħmlu.
Everything is, and it is everything.	Kollox huwa, u huwa kollox.
It's easier for you.	Huwa aktar faċli għalik.
He told me he was going home.	Huwa qalli li kien sejjer id-dar.
Not so much no more.	Mhux daqshekk mhux aktar.
You must come here.	Trid tiġi hawn.
Nor was there anything.	Lanqas ma kien hemm xejn.
It can’t be otherwise.	Ma jistax ikun mod ieħor.
He doesn’t know what he wants to do.	Ma jafx xi jrid jagħmel.
Not much is happening around here.	Ma tantx qed jiġri madwar hawn.
Not much more.	Mhux wisq aktar.
Not so late.	Mhux hekk tard.
It was now.	Kien issa.
That was this week.	Dan kien din il-ġimgħa.
It must be you.	Għandu jkun int.
He was sure no one thought so.	Kien ċert li ħadd ma ħaseb hekk.
That will do it for us.	Li se tagħmel dan għalina.
She looks and looks so good.	Hija tidher u tidher daqshekk tajjeb.
That’s what makes me happy.	Dak hu li jagħmel lili kuntent.
It will probably be my last.	Probabbilment se jkun l-aħħar tiegħi.
Now was not the time.	Issa ma kienx iż-żmien.
I didn’t know how we really were.	Ma kontx taf kif konna verament.
Whatever the time it is.	Ikun xi jkun il-ħin li jkun.
she will say.	se tgħid hi.
And you weren’t.	U int ma kontx.
Maybe, a little.	Jista ', ftit.
More than once.	Aktar minn darba.
No one is out.	Ħadd mhu barra.
I had to do more.	I kellha tagħmel aktar.
He had said no.	Huwa kien qal le.
We are not currently doing so.	Bħalissa mhux qed nagħmlu hekk.
It came back too soon.	Ġie lura wisq malajr.
Never again.	Qatt aktar.
This I see today.	Dan nara llum.
I think he had fun.	Naħseb li ħa gost.
It's too late.	Wasal tard wisq.
He had not seen this coming.	Ma kienx ra dan ġej.
You need some help.	Għandek bżonn xi għajnuna.
Now he can do whatever he wants.	Issa jista’ jagħmel li jrid.
That has to come from me.	Dak ikollu jiġi minni.
But here comes.	Imma ġej.
He knew what was coming.	Kien jaf x’kien se jiġi.
Besides, that's not what happened.	Barra minn hekk, mhux dak li ġara.
It goes fast.	Imur malajr.
It could have been there.	Seta’ kien hemm.
You did nothing wrong.	Inti għamilt xejn ħażin.
I would say he should.	Jien ngħid li għandu.
For a while.	Għal ftit.
And there it is.	U hemm.
And it won’t be easy.	U mhux se jkun faċli.
Everything looks good to me.	Kollox jidher tajjeb għalija.
It will be exactly as you say.	Se jkun eżatt kif tgħid.
It's a bit.	Huwa daqsxejn.
Everything looks good.	Kollox jidher tajjeb.
Really, really good.	Tassew, tassew tajjeb.
I'm very happy.	Jien kuntent ħafna.
He told me not to do anything.	Huwa qalli biex ma nagħmel xejn.
I hope he is.	Nispera li se.
Time always seems bad.	Il-ħin dejjem jidher ħażin.
We were so little.	Konna daqshekk ftit.
There is only one.	Hemm wieħed biss.
It never happened to me.	Qatt ma ġara lili.
I don't know how that can happen.	Ma nafx kif dan jista’ jiġri.
It can be so difficult.	Jista 'jkun daqshekk diffiċli.
Most people are.	Ħafna nies huma.
And he keeps playing.	U jibqa’ jilgħab.
This is not our problem.	Din mhix il-problema tagħna.
I can understand that.	Jien nista' nifhem dan.
I don’t want to do these things.	Ma rridx nagħmel dawn l-affarijiet.
He came looking pretty tired.	Wasal jidher pjuttost għajjien.
I still had time, but probably not much.	Għadni kelli ħin, imma probabbilment mhux ħafna.
I really don’t think it will.	Verament ma naħsibx li se.
I wish you better.	Nixtieq aħjar.
That should be it.	Dak għandu jkun.
This can be anything you want.	Dan jista 'jkun dak kollu li trid.
You can do anything you want.	Tista 'tagħmel kull ħaġa li trid.
It's been a long time.	Ilu hawn ħafna.
I have a lot of these.	Għandi ħafna minn dawn.
Who is it.	Min hu.
Tomorrow would not be so bad.	Għada ma jkunx daqshekk ħażin.
She did well.	Hija għamlet tajjeb.
I heard I was wrong.	Smajt kont ħażin.
If you are happy where you are, good for you.	Jekk inti kuntent fejn int, tajjeb għalik.
Or, the car could be a problem.	Jew, il-karozza tista 'tkun problema.
You know, when she is.	Taf, meta hi.
It all plays out.	Dan kollu jilgħab.
That's for sure.	Dak żgur.
Look back.	Ħares lura.
As we knew it would.	Kif konna nafu li se.
But this is wrong.	Imma dan huwa ħażin.
Nothing there, either.	Xejn hemm, lanqas.
Why is she.	Għaliex hi.
Boy, he said.	Tifel, qal.
Everyone said it was.	Kulħadd qal li kienet.
Why not do it now.	Għaliex ma tagħmilx hekk issa.
But it was never mine.	Imma qatt ma kienet tiegħi.
That would be a wonderful thing to do.	Dik tkun ħaġa sabiħa li tagħmel.
I speak.	Jien nitkellem.
She wants to know how.	Hija trid tkun taf kif.
After that happened.	Wara li ġara.
So much work.	Tant xogħol.
That was hard to take.	Dik kienet diffiċli biex tieħu.
It would have been a lot easier.	Kien ikun ħafna aktar faċli.
Something to please.	Xi ħaġa li jekk jogħġbok.
It was not ready yet.	Għadu ma kienx lest.
That could be a good thing.	Li tista’ tkun xi ħaġa tajba.
I knew it was going to be bad.	Kont naf li kien se jkun ħażin.
It was just a lot of work to get here.	Kien biss ħafna xogħol biex wasal hawn.
I need some work on my book.	Għandi bżonn xi xogħol fuq il-ktieb tiegħi.
So it was.	Hekk sar.
I want to go back home.	Nixtieq immur lura d-dar.
It was as big as the previous one.	Kien kbir daqs dak ta’ qabel.
I can say something great was there.	Nista 'ngħid xi ħaġa kbira kien hemm.
It can do that.	Dan jista 'jagħmel dan.
That was better, he thought.	Dan kien aħjar, ħaseb.
It was none of this stuff.	Ma kienet xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet.
That time has come again.	Wasal dak iż-żmien mill-ġdid.
But not like that.	Imma mhux bħal din.
And nothing more.	U xejn aktar.
This school is great.	Din l-iskola hija kbira.
Obviously, it should be.	Ovvjament, għandu jkun.
It's not too late.	Għadu mhux tard wisq.
It was for you.	Kien għalik.
There he is.	Hemm hu.
I did it myself.	Jien għamilt jien.
It was actually really great.	Kien fil-fatt tassew kbir.
It often does.	Ħafna drabi jagħmel.
Let me tell you something.	Ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
A little bit.	Ftit ftit.
As soon as possible.	Malajr kemm jista 'jkun.
But it wasn’t him.	Imma ma kienx hu.
I almost go back.	Kważi mmur lura.
But neither is he sure of this.	Imma lanqas hu ċert minn dan.
I have none.	M'għandi l-ebda.
It takes everything back.	Hija tieħu kollox lura.
She was talking about someone saying something about something.	Kienet titkellem dwar xi ħadd jgħid xi ħaġa dwar xi ħaġa.
I know you can do that.	Naf li tista’ tagħmel dan.
She could tell it could be better.	Hija tista 'tgħid li jista' jkun aħjar.
I wasn't sure what was going to happen.	Ma kontx ċert x’kien se jiġri.
It just happened.	Ġara biss.
And they were.	U kienu.
It should be working now.	Għandu jkun qed jaħdem issa.
First you.	L-ewwel int.
I'm afraid of nothing.	Nibża' minn xejn.
I didn't want that to happen again.	Ma ridtx li jerġa’ jiġri.
I do something wrong.	Nagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina.
Most people do.	Ħafna nies jagħmlu.
And not by a few.	U mhux bi ftit.
That was coming, she knew.	Dak kien ġej, kienet taf.
I needed to know, I see.	Kelli bżonn inkun naf, nara.
I'm not even that.	Jien lanqas dak.
We can know many things.	Nistgħu nkunu nafu ħafna affarijiet.
Okay, you know.	Tajjeb, taf.
It just looks so bad, right now.	Huwa biss jidher daqshekk ħażin, bħalissa.
In fact, she is one.	Fil-fatt, hi waħda.
I would like to know why.	Nixtieq inkun naf għaliex.
I’m not telling anyone.	Jien ma ngħid lil ħadd.
And you ?.	U inti?.
It looked really bad.	Huwa ħares tassew ħażin.
I'm afraid that's all we have.	Nibża li dak kollu li għandna.
It's there.	Huwa hemmhekk.
She was.	Hija kienet.
You have to come.	Trid tiġi.
She was.	Hija kienet.
It should not have.	M'għandux ikollu.
Not after last night.	Mhux wara lbieraħ filgħaxija.
I wanted that.	Jien ridt li.
It needs to be good enough.	Jeħtieġ li jkun tajjeb biżżejjed.
I still believe it’s a great idea.	Għadni nemmen li hija idea kbira.
There are a lot of people out there.	Hemm ħafna nies hemmhekk.
Not a very good one.	Mhix waħda tajba ħafna.
I don't want any of yours.	Jien ma rrid ħadd minn tiegħek.
It's too late.	Huwa tard wisq.
I wasn’t, of course.	Jien ma kontx, ovvjament.
I'm so worried.	Jien tant inkwetat.
I don't want to eat anything right now.	Ma rrid niekol xejn bħalissa.
As soon as you can.	Hekk kif tista'.
No one knows why.	Ħadd ma jaf għaliex.
He can do something like that.	Jista 'jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik.
But how? 	Imma kif?
I put it back.	I poġġa lura.
But it will happen.	Imma se jiġri.
It was here, now she knew.	Kien hawn, issa kienet taf.
All of them were.	Kollha kemm huma kienu.
That's what it was supposed to be.	Dak hu li suppost kellu jkun.
But he does.	Imma hu jagħmel.
That would be good.	Dan ikun tajjeb.
He really didn't know.	Huwa verament ma kienx jaf.
I still have only one.	Għadni biss wieħed.
But it won't.	Imma mhux se.
But even that was not enough.	Imma lanqas dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
But nothing forever remains the same.	Imma xejn għal dejjem ma jibqa l-istess.
Or that there isn’t.	Jew li ma jkunx hemm.
I don’t know how bad it is.	Ma nafx kemm hu ħażin.
It can't be.	Ma jistax ikun.
But, no, they are out of here.	Imma, le, huma barra minn hawn.
I’m trying to think of something.	Qed nipprova naħseb xi ħaġa.
He is still a man.	Għadu raġel.
It may have been there for a while.	Seta’ kien hemm għal xi żmien.
But not sure.	Imma mhux ċert.
I know how they are.	Naf kif dawn huma.
I don’t do things like that.	Jien ma nagħmel affarijiet bħal dawn.
But not much.	Imma mhux ħafna.
He is there right now.	Huwa hemm bħalissa.
There is a way for everyone.	Hemm mod għal kulħadd.
Maybe someday there will be a time.	Forsi xi darba jkun hemm żmien.
I still see that a lot.	Għadni nara li ħafna.
He hasn't done anything yet.	Għadu ma għamel xejn.
But not much.	Imma mhux ħafna.
I try a lot.	Nipprova ħafna.
Now let’s.	Issa ejja.
That’s quite a thing.	Dik hija pjuttost ħaġa.
Maybe it still does.	Forsi għadha tagħmel.
It’s really something.	Hux verament xi ħaġa.
What he was doing.	X'kien qed jagħmel.
You will go home soon.	Int ser tmur id-dar dalwaqt.
With a small child.	Flimkien ma’ tifel żgħir.
I came back to tell you so.	Ġejt lura biex ngħidlek hekk.
You do what you can.	Inti tagħmel dak li tista '.
Now none of this is going to happen.	Issa xejn minn dan mhu se jkun qed jiġri.
He was a very good man.	Kien raġel tajjeb ħafna.
I wonder what he is doing now.	Nistaqsi x'qed jagħmel issa.
We had some time together.	Kellna ftit ħin flimkien.
They were either us or they are.	Kienu jew aħna jew huma.
And it’s still very early.	U għadu kmieni ħafna.
Very good.	Tajjeb ħafna.
It is very small.	Huwa żgħir ħafna.
Easy for him to say.	Faċli għalih jgħid.
I don’t really know who they were.	Ma nafx verament min kienu.
This is better.	Dan huwa aħjar.
He may have something there.	Jista’ jkollu xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
You might as well go back to me another way.	Inti tista 'ukoll tmur lura lili mod kif ieħor.
That was just a few years ago.	Dan kien biss ftit snin ilu.
It takes too long.	Huwa jieħu wisq żmien.
And nothing more.	U xejn aktar.
She is not at home.	Hija mhix id-dar.
I had done so.	Kien għamilt hekk.
I thought about it many times.	Ħsibt ħafna drabi.
But let me tell you something.	Imma ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
I don’t know how that happened.	Ma nafx kif ġara dan.
At the time, he would have.	Dak iż-żmien, kien ikollu.
Have you seen one before?	Qatt rajt waħda qabel?
They have everything.	Għandhom kollox.
I don’t know exactly where she is, he said.	Ma nafx eżatt fejn hi, qal.
I will have to be there.	Ikolli nkun hemm.
But how to do it.	Imma kif tagħmel dan.
Much more has happened.	Ġara ħafna aktar minn hekk.
She had done nothing wrong.	Ma kienet għamlet xejn ħażin.
Look what I did.	Ħares dak li għamilt.
There.	Hemm.
He never was.	Hu qatt ma kien.
And that’s good, actually.	U dak tajjeb, fil-fatt.
That never was.	Dak qatt ma kien.
He is a morning person.	Huwa persuna filgħodu.
In fact probably more than ever.	Fil-fatt probabbilment aktar minn qatt qabel.
He had a few friends.	Kellu ftit ħbieb.
Everyone has a chance.	Kulħadd għandu ċans.
I need more.	Għandi bżonn aktar.
It will not happen.	Mhux se jiġri.
I shouldn't be able to say that for sure.	M'għandix inkun nista' ngħid dan għal ċert.
The first one out.	L-ewwel wieħed barra.
And that wasn’t the only time it happened.	U dik ma kinitx l-unika darba li ġara.
I just want to be happy, he said.	Irrid biss li jkun kuntent, qal.
I know nothing about it.	Jien ma naf xejn dwarha.
He really was a good man.	Huwa tassew kien raġel tajjeb.
But no one seems to know where he is.	Imma ħadd ma jidher li jaf fejn hu.
You will see things that you can do much better.	Inti se tara affarijiet li inti tista 'tagħmel ħafna aħjar.
If you were here, you know.	Jekk kont hawn, taf.
I don’t want to.	Ma rridx jien.
But we can do something about it.	Imma nistgħu nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwar dan.
I'm not ready for that.	Jien mhux lest għal dan.
Well, that's it.	Tajjeb, dak hu.
It’s either good or it’s bad.	Huwa jew tajjeb jew huwa ħażin.
Someone you know.	Xi ħadd li taf.
I love him.	Jien inħobb miegħu.
Still pretty easy.	Għadha pjuttost faċli.
We both know you’re up to nothing good.	It-tnejn nafu li int sa xejn tajjeb.
And now you want to go home.	U issa trid tmur id-dar.
He really will be on.	Huwa verament se tkun fuq.
You don't say anything.	Inti ma tgħid xejn.
And a lot of fun.	U gost ħafna.
This will not happen today.	Dan mhux se jiġri llum.
You have to be fast.	Trid tkun malajr.
This is what I came for.	Dan huwa dak li ġejt għalih.
It makes me really really happy.	Jagħmel lili verament tassew kuntent.
He speaks too fast.	Titkellem malajr wisq.
He knows that is more than that.	Jaf li huwa aktar minn hekk.
I don’t know how she did it.	Ma nafx kif għamlet dan.
No, not there.	Le, mhux hemm.
That’s probably what always happens.	Dak huwa probabbilment dak li dejjem jiġri.
I didn't know what to say.	Ma kontx naf x’se ngħid.
Not much, really.	Mhux ħafna, tassew.
Everyone seemed to be worried about it now.	Deher li kulħadd kien inkwetat dwarha issa.
Sorry I had to ask.	Jiddispjaċini kelli nistaqsi.
I think he is.	Naħseb li hu.
He goes to the door.	Jmur lejn il-bieb.
One for each.	Wieħed għal kull wieħed.
That would be too much.	Dan ikun wisq.
But he must be alone.	Imma jrid ikun waħdu.
He knew it was going to happen.	Kien jaf li kien se jiġri.
I’m often as happy as I am.	Jien spiss kuntent daqskemm le.
He was not going to play.	Ma kienx se jilgħab.
He said he just wanted to talk.	Qal li ried biss jitkellem.
I am very happy with him.	Jien kuntent ħafna miegħu.
He just wasn't.	Huwa biss ma kienx.
You always have and always will.	Dejjem għandek u dejjem se.
I have not seen such a thing for many, many years.	Ilni ma nara ħaġa bħal din għal ħafna u ħafna snin.
Let me ask now.	Ħa nistaqsi issa.
He was afraid of me.	Kien jibża minni.
But he was so tired.	Imma tant kien għajjien.
One thing is what it is and not something else.	Ħaġa hija dak li hu u mhux xi ħaġa oħra.
This can go either way.	Dan jista 'jmur jew mod.
I didn’t see anyone.	Jien ma rajt lil ħadd.
He said he knew nothing about it.	Qal li ma kien jaf xejn dwarha.
Well, here we are.	Ukoll, hawn aħna.
And he could have.	U seta’ jkollu.
I would like to talk to you today if you are around.	Nixtieq nitkellem miegħek illum jekk inti madwar.
This is too much for me.	Dan huwa wisq għalija.
That's it for.	Dak huwa hemm għal.
Everyone looked at the door.	Kulħadd ħares lejn il-bieb.
I'm happy now.	Jien kuntent issa.
He loves to help.	Iħobb jgħin.
I’ve never seen anything do what it does.	Qatt ma rajt xejn jagħmel dak li jagħmel.
He was a boy.	Kien tifel.
She was sitting.	Kienet bilqiegħda.
Something was there.	Xi ħaġa kienet hemmhekk.
She knows why she is there.	Hija taf għaliex hi hemm.
I expect him to say something.	Nistenna li jgħid xi ħaġa.
It is very difficult.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna.
He can't know anything about it.	Ma jista’ jkun jaf xejn dwar dan.
I still have a lot.	Jien għadni ħafna.
Not sure what happened, of course.	Mhux ċert x'ġara, ovvjament.
It's more than you say.	Huwa aktar milli tgħid.
I'm back home.	Jien lura d-dar.
In fact, it was not a bad idea.	Fil-fatt, ma kinitx idea ħażina.
He couldn't know.	Ma setax jaf.
I doubt it would.	Niddubita li kieku.
I couldn't go alone.	Ma stajtx immur waħdi.
I'm afraid she can.	Nibża li hi tista’.
Quite like this.	Pjuttost bħal dan.
Now you want to eat.	Issa trid tiekol.
Maybe it's the same.	Forsi huwa l-istess.
A few years ago.	Ftit snin ilu.
Someone knows for sure.	Xi ħadd jaf żgur.
I don’t quite understand.	Jien ma tantx nifhem.
He was not back.	Hu ma kienx lura.
I'm too scared to ask.	Wisq nibża’ nistaqsi.
And it’s just great.	U huwa biss kbir.
I might be talking to someone.	Nista’ nkun qed nitkellem ma’ xi ħadd.
Everyone wanted it that way.	Kulħadd ried hekk.
It’s not a morning person.	Mhuwiex persuna filgħodu.
I don’t even expect to eat anything.	Jien ma nistenna lanqas biex niekol xi ħaġa.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
There can be nothing more than that.	Jista 'jkun hemm xejn aktar minn hekk.
But not work.	Imma mhux xogħol.
They need help.	Għandhom bżonn l-għajnuna.
Glad of that too.	Ferħan minn hekk ukoll.
It was soon for nothing.	Dalwaqt ma kien għal xejn.
You have to be home.	Għandek tkun id-dar.
That's really not so much.	Dak verament mhux daqshekk.
That is enough for me.	Dan huwa biżżejjed għalija.
But it was hard to tell.	Imma kien diffiċli li tgħid.
It will not happen.	Mhux se jiġri.
Not just me and you.	Mhux jien u int biss.
He never asked what it was.	Hu qatt ma staqsa x’kien.
You know better than that.	Taf aħjar minn hekk.
I had money.	Kelli flus.
That was trying.	Dak kien qed jipprova.
So many other things.	Tant affarijiet oħra.
At that time.	Dak iż-żmien.
I couldn’t eat anything.	Ma stajt niekol xejn.
You can do something like this.	Tista' tagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din.
You have to do it when you are young.	Trid tagħmel meta tkun żgħir.
I think it’s probably too late.	Naħseb li probabbilment huwa tard wisq.
It doesn’t have to go that way.	M'għandux għalfejn imur hekk.
He was doing a good job.	Kien qed jagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
The first one was just something to do.	L-ewwel waħda kienet biss xi ħaġa li tagħmel.
I think it’s over.	Naħseb li huwa aktar.
And it started well.	U beda tajjeb.
That’s all great.	Dak kollu huwa kbir.
This never happened.	Dan qatt ma kien jiġri.
And so he had.	U hekk kellu.
Enough said on that one.	Biżżejjed qal fuq dak wieħed.
Everyone knows so much.	Kulħadd jaf daqshekk.
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi mhux.
So I did.	Hekk għamilt.
But there were other people on the car.	Imma kien hemm nies oħra fuq il-karozza.
It will be long.	Se jkun twil.
She just knows.	Hija biss taf.
You are not thinking.	M'intix taħseb.
I think I did too.	Naħseb li għamilt ukoll.
I'm that.	Jien dak.
You don’t have to tell me.	M'għandekx għalfejn tgħidli.
Much more.	Ħafna aktar.
Let me go back to that.	Ħa mmur lura għal dak.
I knew he wanted this.	Kont naf li ried dan.
In fact, he did.	Fil-fatt, huwa ma.
I went to my room.	Mort fil-kamra tiegħi.
It is very good for me.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna għalija.
I was out of everything.	Kont barra minn kollox.
And everything is coming soon.	U kollox ġej dalwaqt.
Or he will return.	Jew se jerġa’ lura.
He was the only man.	Kien l-uniku raġel.
Now he knew.	Issa kien jaf.
That was quite a while ago.	Dak kien pjuttost ftit ilu.
I can't understand.	Jien ma nistax nifhem.
All on its own.	Kollha waħedha.
There is nothing we can do.	M'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu.
I hope you don’t have to come here.	Nittama li m'għandekx għalfejn tiġi hawn.
We were south, way south.	Konna nofsinhar, mod nofsinhar.
I never knew.	Qatt ma kont taf.
First I was here!	L-ewwel kont hawn!
I did nothing!	Jien ma għamilt xejn!
I’m so worried about it.	Jien tant inkwetat dwarha.
He can talk to anyone.	Huwa jista 'jitkellem ma' kulħadd.
Nothing else seemed big enough.	Xejn aktar ma deher kbir biżżejjed.
Everything was fine, everything was fine.	Kollox kien tajjeb, kollox kien tajjeb.
He certainly wasn't thinking.	Żgur ma kienx qed jaħseb.
It was he who left.	Kien hu li telaq.
Well, that's it.	Ukoll, dan huwa.
There was so much to see!	Kien hemm ħafna x'tara!
It's none of the above.	Huwa xejn minn hawn fuq.
He does so now.	Huwa jagħmel hekk issa.
I was good with that.	I kien tajjeb ma 'dak.
There is a chance he can win.	Hemm ċans li jista’ jirbaħ.
Another man tells the truth.	Raġel ieħor jgħid il-verità.
I need to think.	Għandi bżonn naħseb.
I did it.	Għamilt dan.
Not so long ago, not so long ago.	Mhux daqshekk ilu, lanqas hekk.
And to each other.	U lil xulxin.
He has many friends.	Għandu ħafna ħbieb.
I just don’t know how to do that.	Jien biss ma nafx kif nagħmel hekk.
I don’t know why not but not.	Ma nafx għaliex mhux imma mhux.
Stay here now.	Qiegħed hawn issa.
I told no one.	għidt lil ħadd.
It doesn't have to be.	M’għandux għalfejn ikun.
I'm listening.	Qed nisma’.
One time.	Darba waħda.
It was just.	Kien biss.
If you wish.	Jekk tixtieq.
Or something like that.	Jew xi ħaġa bħal dik.
Something they would never do.	Xi ħaġa li qatt ma kienu jagħmlu.
That I was happy and doing well.	Li kont ferħan u sejjer tajjeb.
He is buying a car this week.	Qed jixtri karozza din il-ġimgħa.
It would have been too much, too fast.	Kien ikun wisq, malajr wisq.
It looks pretty much the same.	Jidher pjuttost l-istess.
Most everyone had gone through too much.	Ħafna kulħadd kien għadda minn wisq.
What works for you, works for you.	Dak li jaħdem għalik, jaħdem għalik.
Not a problem.	Mhix problema.
I like it.	Jien inħobb.
It's been a long time.	Ilu li kien ilu.
I always did.	Dejjem għamilt hekk.
I will not do it again.	Mhux se nerġa’ nagħmel.
I don't want to.	Ma rridx.
He is.	Huwa hu.
I thought he was back.	Ħsibt li kien ġie lura.
He says he is happy.	Jgħid li hu kuntent.
He's a boy!	Huwa tifel!
He couldn't even speak.	Hu lanqas seta’ jitkellem.
I can’t love it anymore.	Ma nistax inħobb aktar.
He was not ready to see anyone.	Ma kienx lest jara lil ħadd.
I wasn’t sure I believed you.	Ma kontx ċert li nemmen li inti.
This should.	Dan għandu.
Until it was exactly what happened.	Sakemm kien eżatt dak li ġara.
I thought he had.	Ħsibt li kellu.
I need some help.	Għandi bżonn xi għajnuna.
I wanted to talk more.	Ridt nitkellem aktar.
He wasn’t entirely sure.	Hu ma kienx ċert għal kollox.
I should have known they were friends.	I kellha naf li kienu ħbieb.
Put another.	Poġġa ieħor.
If you want to be.	Jekk trid tkun.
This is our only job.	Dan huwa l-uniku xogħol tagħna.
It's not small though.	Mhuwiex żgħir jekk.
This always happens when you are late.	Dan dejjem jiġri meta tkun tard.
And he knew he would.	U kien jaf li kieku.
I saw it happen.	Rajt jiġri.
It's going so well.	Huwa sejjer hekk tajjeb.
Also, it’s not here right now.	Barra minn hekk, bħalissa mhux hawn.
It’s been there today, everything looks good.	Ilu hemm illum, kollox jidher tajjeb.
I never was, not really.	Qatt ma kont, mhux verament.
No way, no how.	L-ebda mod, l-ebda kif.
That, of course, is a lot.	Dak, ovvjament, huwa ħafna.
I think that’s a good thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba.
He wanted to try again.	Ried jerġa’ jipprova.
It wouldn’t have been good.	Ma kienx ikun tajjeb.
And this is not a bad thing.	U din mhix xi ħaġa ħażina.
He is a really good man.	Huwa raġel tassew tajjeb.
This is the first.	Dan huwa l-ewwel.
Someone you know, more or less.	Xi ħadd li taf, xi ftit jew wisq.
I didn’t want to do that.	Ma ridtx nagħmel dan.
She was the only one who wasn’t.	Kienet l-unika waħda li ma kinitx.
I'm very tired.	Jien għajjien ħafna.
He lost his job.	Huwa tilef ix-xogħol tiegħu.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwarha.
It's too early.	Għadu kmieni.
And he.	U hu.
He would never go back.	Hu qatt ma kien se jmur lura.
He had started coming back to him.	Kien beda jiġi lura għandu.
I did what he said.	Għamilt dak li qal.
It is not going to work.	Mhux sejjer jaħdem.
I will get back to that.	Ikolli nerġa' lura għal dan.
We want everyone to leave very happy.	Irridu li kulħadd jitlaq ferħan ħafna.
It was a good time to think.	Kien żmien tajjeb biex taħseb.
But if she did.	Imma jekk hi għamlet.
There is really nothing more to it.	M'hemm verament xejn aktar għal dan.
We did it once.	Għamilna darba.
And he is here with us.	U hu hawn magħna.
Never, ’he said.	Qatt,’ qal.
She was wearing nothing more.	Ma kienet liebes xejn aktar.
But she would.	Imma hi kieku.
It won’t be long now, he thought.	Ma jkunx twil issa, ħaseb.
This was not the same.	Dan ma kienx l-istess.
I won’t even talk to you tomorrow.	Lanqas se nitkellem miegħek għada.
I don’t want to go back.	Ma rridx lura.
I’ve never been before.	Jien qatt ma kont qabel.
You have to do it again.	Għandek tagħmel dan għal darba oħra.
Maybe again.	Forsi mill-ġdid.
There will be one last time, one last chance.	Ikun hemm l-aħħar darba, l-aħħar ċans.
It can't happen.	Ma jistax jiġri.
But this is ready.	Imma dan huwa lest.
In fact, it can be quite easy.	Fil-fatt, fil-fatt jista 'jkun pjuttost faċli.
Everyone.	Kulħadd.
It seemed to work well.	Deher li jaħdem tajjeb.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ma jista’ jagħmel xejn ħażin.
I want to make friends.	Nixtieq nagħmel ħbieb.
I thought quickly.	Ħsibt malajr.
I couldn’t understand why no one was doing this.	Ma stajtx nifhem għaliex ħadd ma kien qed jagħmel dan.
And he will go.	U hu se jmur.
I think it will take longer.	Naħseb li se tieħu aktar żmien.
But not likely.	Imma mhux probabbli.
There was nothing here.	Hawn ma kien hemm xejn.
I am thinking of you too.	Qed naħseb għalik ukoll.
Or they should.	Jew għandhom.
That works much, much better.	Li jaħdem ħafna, ħafna aħjar.
I didn’t know where they were.	Ma kontx naf fejn kienu.
And maybe it's just a chance.	U forsi huwa biss ċans.
You had a lot of help.	Kellek ħafna għajnuna.
He is one of me.	Huwa wieħed minni.
He doesn't like it.	Hu ma jħobbx.
It still looks good.	Għadu jidher tajjeb.
I'm waiting.	Qed nistenna.
They make a lot of money.	Jagħmlu ħafna u ħafna flus.
That was work.	Dan kien xogħol.
I have a lot.	Għandi ħafna.
But now was not the time.	Imma issa ma kienx iż-żmien.
It was all mine.	Kien kollox tiegħi.
That she can be anyone she wants to be.	Li hi tista’ tkun kull min trid tkun.
Sometimes that is the case.	Xi drabi dan ikun hekk.
Maybe it wasn't.	Forsi ma kienx.
No, no problem here.	Le, l-ebda problema hawn.
She can't do it fast enough.	Hija ma tistax tagħmel dan malajr biżżejjed.
Your work must be done and it must be finished.	Ix-xogħol tiegħek irid isir u jrid ikun lest.
It was all she needed.	Kien dak kollu li kellha bżonn.
No, it will not be so forever.	Le, mhux se jkun hekk għal dejjem.
If that works.	Jekk dak jaħdem.
You can't do more.	Ma tistax tagħmel aktar.
That's much better.	Dak ħafna aħjar.
It could have been.	Seta’ kien.
We had made money, but not friends.	Konna għamilna flus, imma mhux ħbieb.
Nice thing.	Ħaġa sabiħa.
We’ve had this happen a few times.	Kellna dan jiġri xi ftit drabi.
I had never seen anything more beautiful.	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa aktar sabiħa.
I think it would, someday.	Naħseb li kieku, xi darba.
I will not believe that.	Jien mhux se nemmen li.
It's working.	Qed jaħdem.
I know he has for me.	Naf li għandu għalija.
will say.	se jgħid.
There goes a car.	Hemm tmur karozza.
Everything that comes before is here.	Dak kollu li jiġi qabel qiegħed hawn.
Good and bad.	Tajjeb u ħażin.
You can't do both.	Ma tistax tagħmel it-tnejn.
But she knows who did it.	Imma hi taf min għamel.
I love the two together.	Inħobb it-tnejn flimkien.
Nobody does that.	Ħadd ma jagħmel hekk.
I would be around.	Jien inkun madwar.
I've been here too long.	Ilni hawn wisq.
That's where he was.	Dak fejn kien.
I'm not sure why this is.	M'inix ċert għaliex dan hu.
But we can't and.	Imma ma nistgħux u.
Maybe just a little.	Forsi biss ftit.
It wasn’t good.	Ma kienx tajjeb.
But we know each other.	Imma nafu lil xulxin.
He was not eating.	Ma kienx jiekol.
I saw how hard it was, come here.	Rajt kemm kien diffiċli, ġej hawn.
I hope this is so.	Nispera li dan ikun hekk.
This has happened many times.	Dan ġara ħafna drabi.
This is what is likely to happen.	Dan huwa dak li x'aktarx jiġri.
I can’t think exactly.	Ma nistax naħseb eżatt.
We were friends.	Konna ħbieb.
I was saying something, he was saying something.	Jien kont qed ngħid xi ħaġa, kien qed jgħid xi ħaġa.
I’m doing pretty well on my own.	Jien sejjer pjuttost tajjeb waħdi.
It’s not such a big deal.	Mhix ħaġa daqshekk kbira.
Who knows.	Min jaf.
There was a lot to see.	Kien hemm ħafna x'tara.
But they were there.	Imma kienu hemm.
It was like we weren't even there.	Kien qisu lanqas konna hemm.
I'm not interested.	M'iniex interessat.
Everyone knows it will never happen.	Kulħadd jaf li qatt mhu se jiġri.
I did so.	Jien għamilt hekk.
And this is not a good thing.	U din mhix xi ħaġa tajba.
It was just.	Kien biss.
I don't even want to.	Lanqas irrid.
This too can work.	Dan ukoll jista 'jaħdem.
In fact not.	Fil-fatt le.
He just left from there.	Huwa biss telaq minn hemm.
He never came home.	Qatt ma ġie d-dar.
Say what is needed.	Għid dak li hemm bżonn.
They are just.	Huma biss.
You just say no.	Għadek tgħid le.
From there it comes.	Minn hemm ġej.
This was never done.	Dan qatt ma sar.
Nobody does.	Ħadd ma jagħmel.
It wasn’t hard to do.	Ma kienx diffiċli li tagħmel.
That’s what one does.	Dak huwa dak li wieħed jagħmel.
That is for sure.	Dan huwa żgur.
He was always with us.	Dejjem kien magħna.
I can stand it.	Jien nista' noqgħod.
She knows what happened to me.	Hi taf x’ġara lili.
I saw so much.	Rajt tant.
Not from anyone.	Mhux minn ħadd.
He's supposed to be here.	Suppost li jkun hawn.
Or is it ?.	Jew hi?.
But better not.	Imma aħjar le.
I know these things.	Naf dawn l-affarijiet.
Or is it just finished.	Jew huwa biss lest.
It wasn’t a big deal.	Ma kienx xi ħaġa kbira.
I thought we could go both.	Ħsibt li nistgħu mmorru t-tnejn.
You don’t want the truth.	Inti ma tridx il-verità.
That had happened before.	Dak kien ġara qabel.
So it was with me.	Hekk kien miegħi.
That was good.	Dan kien tajjeb.
I have to be that.	Jien għandi nkun dak.
I’m not saying more.	Jien mhux qed ngħid aktar.
He had never done so before.	Qatt ma kien għamel hekk qabel.
It was very difficult.	Kien diffiċli ħafna.
I have to do that too.	Jien għandi nagħmel hekk ukoll.
If you think.	Jekk taħseb.
I just don't.	I biss ma.
It’s about what we’re doing here.	Huwa dwar dak li qed nagħmlu hawn.
Something more here.	Xi ħaġa aktar hawn.
I was just a little boy.	Kont biss tifel żgħir.
I believe in you.	Nemmen miegħek.
Not much, it seemed.	Mhux ħafna, deher.
It probably wasn’t here.	X'aktarx ma kienx hawn.
They are right.	Huma għandhom raġun.
He wasn't now.	Huwa ma kienx issa.
I think a lot about it.	Naħseb ħafna dwar dan.
A little bit.	Ftit ftit.
How to make our book.	Kif jagħmel il-ktieb tagħna.
I really, really did.	Jien tassew, tassew għamilt.
This is not so.	Dan mhux hekk.
And no money.	U bla flus.
It is still.	Huwa għadu.
Sure, he thought, he had to do it.	Żgur, ħaseb, kellha tagħmel.
I knew exactly what was going to happen.	Kont naf eżatt x’kien se jiġri.
He couldn't sit down and do nothing.	Ma setax joqgħod bilqiegħda ma jagħmel xejn.
If he was right, he couldn't stay here.	Kieku kellha raġun, ma setax jibqa’ hawn.
This will help things.	Dan se jgħin l-affarijiet.
I think she’s here.	Naħseb li hi hawn.
Maybe you didn’t know this.	Forsi ma kontx taf dan.
He is right, of course.	Huwa għandu raġun, ovvjament.
They felt bad.	Ħassu ħażin.
It was so.	Kien hekk.
I talk a lot with him.	Jien nitkellem ħafna miegħu.
he is saying.	qed jgħid.
He shouldn't have died that way.	Ma kellux miet hekk.
There is something there.	Hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
I was more than a little surprised.	I kien aktar minn ftit sorpriż.
He was scared of me.	Kien jibża minni.
You can never tell what will happen.	Qatt ma tista’ tgħid x’se jiġri.
Time passed quickly.	Iż-żmien għadda malajr.
For many people it is both.	Għal ħafna nies huwa t-tnejn.
That’s what I’m trying to do.	Dak hu li qed nipprova nagħmel.
But that would come later.	Imma dan kien jiġi aktar tard.
I want that for me.	Irrid li għalija.
I never knew who he was.	Qatt ma kont naf min kien.
Can you think of anything ?.	Tista' taħseb xi ħaġa?.
You could have been with him.	Seta’ kont hemm miegħu.
No one knows how to do that.	Ħadd ma jaf kif jagħmel dan.
No, it's not a problem.	Le, mhix problema.
there you go.	hemm tmur.
It should be ready soon.	Huwa għandu jkun lest dalwaqt.
Maybe he can.	Forsi jista’.
One thing at a time.	Ħaġa waħda kull darba.
Nor did he seem surprised.	Lanqas deher sorpriż.
You can't talk.	Ma tistax titkellem.
I was too late, he said.	I kien tard wisq, huwa qal.
And here we are again.	U hawn aħna mill-ġdid.
Good and good.	Tajjeb u tajjeb.
It will definitely be back.	Żgur li se jkun lura.
I wanted to make time.	Ridt nagħmel ħin.
Back after that.	Lura wara dan.
You said that.	Inti għidt li.
You want to know this.	Trid tkun taf dan.
You go home.	Tmur id-dar.
It just goes on and on.	Hija biss tmur fuq u fuq.
As it turns out.	Kif jidher hu.
He can work with that.	Huwa jista 'jaħdem ma' dak.
But not everyone gets to be happy.	Imma mhux kulħadd jasal biex ikun ferħan.
No one would ever do that.	Ħadd qatt ma kien jagħmel hekk.
Okay, he said.	Tajjeb, qal.
It was just him.	Kien hu biss.
Everything went well.	Kollox mar tajjeb.
Where is it? 	Hemm fejn?
Obviously, this will take some time.	Ovvjament, dan se jieħu xi żmien.
I’m not entirely sure why it is so.	M'inix ċert għal kollox għaliex hu hekk.
I'm there now.	Jien hemm issa.
But come on.	Imma ejja.
I understand why you want to do this.	Nifhem għaliex trid tagħmel dan.
But it was just so.	Imma kien biss hekk.
Everything was working fine.	Kollox kien qed jaħdem tajjeb.
Everyone has today.	Kulħadd għandu llum.
But that’s not what happened.	Imma dan mhux dak li ġara.
I'm ready to go now.	Jien lest li mmur issa.
She wasn’t doing it.	Hija ma kinitx tagħmel dan.
No one knows how much.	Ħadd ma jaf kemm.
And he went back quickly.	U mar lura malajr.
This never, ever happens today.	Dan qatt, qatt ma jiġri llum.
That one.	Dik wieħed.
A few things.	Ftit affarijiet.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
Or something like that.	Jew xi ħaġa bħal dik.
Not for us.	Mhux għalina.
I have no chance.	M'għandi l-ebda ċans.
It just had to happen.	Kellha jiġri biss.
It’s time to go.	Wasal iż-żmien li tmur.
Just as you think you are.	Eżatt kif taħseb li int.
Good thing you want what you want.	Tajjeb li trid dak li trid.
No one was ever sure.	Ħadd qatt ma kien ċert.
It doesn't have to be difficult.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun diffiċli.
She knew fast enough.	Hija kienet taf malajr biżżejjed.
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi ma.
I think so.	Naħseb li hekk.
Quick and easy to do.	Malajr u faċli biex tagħmel.
He came here yesterday	Ġie hawn ilbieraħ
I can be the last.	Jien nista’ nkun l-aħħar.
He seems to have.	Jidher li għandu.
She had no friends.	Ma kellha l-ebda ħbieb.
He was a great man to work for.	Kien raġel kbir biex jaħdem għalih.
It could have been someone.	Seta’ kien xi ħadd.
It's a long time coming.	Huwa żmien twil ġej.
That would be better.	Dak ikun aħjar.
No one was happy about it.	Ħadd ma kien kuntent dwar dan.
It just has fun.	Huwa biss jieħu gost.
I think more than anyone else can.	Naħseb aktar li ħadd ieħor ma jista’.
Never, ever, ever.	Qatt, qatt, qatt.
I’m actually a man.	Jien fil-fatt raġel.
You do a great job.	Inti tagħmel xogħol kbir.
Here's one way to do it.	Hawn mod wieħed biex tagħmel dan.
We know this is not your thing.	Aħna nafu li dan mhux tagħmel tiegħek.
I try to think back to everything that happened to me.	Nipprova naħseb lura għal dak kollu li ġara lili.
It sure goes all or nothing.	Huwa żgur li jmur kollox jew xejn.
I will not stay long.	Mhux se noqgħod twil.
This is more of a problem for me.	Din hija aktar problema għalija.
That's not so.	Dak mhux hekk.
We just don't.	Aħna biss ma.
Tell no one.	Tgħid lil ħadd.
He did not know what to do to help.	Ma kienx jaf x’għandu jagħmel biex jgħin.
I’m glad to be here.	Jien kuntent li nkun hawn.
I love how hard it is.	Inħobb kemm hu diffiċli.
But no one else did.	Imma ħadd ieħor ma għamel.
It can still work.	Għadu jista 'jaħdem.
It's been so long!	Għadda tant żmien!
Maybe they should.	Forsi għandhom.
And if anything can happen, fine.	U jekk jista’ jiġri xi ħaġa, tajjeb.
More on this here.	Aktar dwar dan hawn.
In fact, she was.	Fil-fatt, kienet kienet.
It’s just the truth.	Hija biss il-verità.
This is what will happen.	Dan huwa dak li se jiġri.
But of course.	Imma ovvjament.
Let's go let's.	Ejja mmorru ejja.
It is so now.	Huwa hekk issa.
I don’t want to go back to that.	Ma rridx immur lura għal dak.
Are you with us ?.	Int magħna?.
This I do a lot.	Dan nagħmel ħafna.
No one comes.	Ħadd ma jiġi.
You, for sure.	Int, żgur.
I love being here.	Inħobb inkun hawn.
I think he's talking to everyone.	Naħseb li qed jitkellem ma' kulħadd.
But you don't have to be.	Imma m'għandekx għalfejn tkun.
This will never happen.	Dan qatt mhu se jiġri.
I say this.	Jien ngħid dan.
I thought it was pretty good.	Ħsibt li kien pjuttost tajjeb.
I'm sure they are.	Jien ċert li huma.
From another.	Minn ieħor.
She was capable.	Kienet kapaċi.
He left.	Huwa telaq.
And this is a big problem.	U din hija problema kbira.
I thought we would be together forever.	Ħsibt li nkunu flimkien għal dejjem.
Very easy to do.	Faċli ħafna biex tagħmel.
I wondered what he was thinking.	Stajt naħseb x’kien qed jaħseb.
What is i.	X'inhu i.
It would do.	Ikun jagħmel.
It looks good to me.	Jidher tajjeb għalija.
It doesn't take anything.	Ma jieħu xejn.
Or it was good.	Jew kien tajjeb.
It looks very small.	Jidher żgħir ħafna.
Nothing actually.	Xejn fil-fatt.
I'm going back home.	Jien sejjer lura d-dar.
He was going to go when he saw.	Kien se jmur meta ra.
I can’t do anything about it.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn dwarha.
I don't need that.	M'għandix bżonn dan.
Quite often in fact.	Pjuttost drabi fil-fatt.
I can tell you a lot right now.	Nista 'ngħidlek ħafna bħalissa.
I’ve been there forever doing nothing.	Stajt noqgħod hemm għal dejjem ma nagħmel xejn.
It's right there.	Huwa eżatt hemm.
But it was not the same.	Imma ma kienx l-istess.
Well, he should be.	Ukoll, huwa għandu jkun.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma kont ħsibt.
Maybe that would be enough.	Forsi jkun biżżejjed.
li.	li.
It happened to everyone.	Ġara lil kulħadd.
We know this for sure.	Dan nafu żgur.
He was worried.	Huwa kien inkwetat.
This is a pretty big one.	Din hija waħda pjuttost kbira.
You see this happen.	Int tara dan jiġri.
He was willing to try another.	Kien lest li jipprova ieħor.
I don’t take anything.	Jien ma nieħu xejn.
You didn’t go there and sit around.	Inti ma mort hemmhekk u toqgħod madwar.
I hope you know that.	Nispera li taf li.
Same with us.	L-istess magħna.
Nobody knows where you are.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn int.
Now he is here.	Issa hu hawn.
I don’t know why, but he is.	Ma nafx għaliex, imma hu.
What will be, will be.	Dak li se jkun, se jkun.
He doesn’t want to talk.	Ma jridx jitkellem.
I had heard too much, too fast.	Kont smajt wisq, malajr wisq.
I want you to know that you are not alone.	Irrid li tkun taf li m'intix waħdek.
I or they.	Jien jew huma.
The dog did the same.	Il-kelb għamel l-istess.
It can definitely work.	Żgur li jista 'jaħdem.
The problem is, you don't.	Il-problema hija, inti ma.
I just can't wait.	I biss ma nistax nistenna.
He was unable to see.	Ma kienx kapaċi jara.
That's not much.	Li mhux ħafna.
It still looks great.	Għadu jidher kbir.
He was with me.	Huwa kien miegħi.
It's just good.	Huwa biss tajjeb.
I don’t know anything more.	Ma naf xejn aktar.
This didn't go well either.	Dan lanqas ma mar tajjeb.
This is not a good job.	Dan mhux xogħol tajjeb.
Well, not really, no.	Ukoll, mhux verament, le.
Everyone knows what to do.	Kulħadd jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
But she was not going.	Imma hi ma kinitx tmur.
I really am.	Jien tassew.
She had never done so before.	Hija qatt ma kienet għamlet hekk qabel.
He did, for a time.	Huwa għamel, għal żmien.
There was another one the following week.	Il-ġimgħa ta’ wara kien hemm ieħor.
How happy I am.	Kemm jien kuntent.
But difficult, very difficult.	Imma diffiċli, diffiċli ħafna.
Everyone should know that by now.	Kulħadd għandu jkun jaf li sa issa.
He was doing something.	Kien jagħmel xi ħaġa.
But she was still beautiful.	Imma kienet għadha sabiħa.
That's a good thing.	Dik hija ħaġa tajba.
This will not go away.	Dan mhux se jmur.
It's really something.	Huwa verament xi ħaġa.
You’re a kid as much as you’ve ever been.	Int tifel daqskemm qatt kont.
Maybe more than a year.	Forsi aktar minn sena.
She had a lot to say about everything.	Kellha ħafna xi tgħid dwar kollox.
Or there can be nothing.	Jew ma jista' jkun hemm xejn.
He needed to be.	Huwa kellu bżonn li jkun.
It would be done.	Ikun isir.
Everything would have gone well.	Kieku kollox mar tajjeb.
Probably the same as everything else here.	Probabbilment l-istess bħal kull ħaġa oħra hawn.
I want to know something else.	Irrid inkun naf ħaġa oħra.
Enough.	Biżżejjed.
For a bad man.	Għal raġel ħażin.
I think that’s enough.	Naħseb li huwa biżżejjed.
This will happen soon.	Dan se jiġri malajr.
We have a lot of time.	Għandna ħafna ħin.
I just can’t.	Jien biss ma nistax.
She had something.	Kellha xi ħaġa.
He wanted to know more about her.	Ried ikun jaf aktar dwarha.
I can understand why this happens.	Kapaċi nifhem għaliex jiġri hekk.
I thought you’d be better than that.	Ħsibt li int taf tkun aħjar minn hekk.
This is your job.	Dan huwa xogħol tiegħek.
I didn’t know.	Jien ma kontx naf.
Never do that.	Qatt ma tagħmel dan.
Or something she had.	Jew xi ħaġa kellha.
And a boy is mine.	U tifel huwa tiegħi.
I do the same too.	L-istess nagħmel ukoll.
I would, too.	Inkun, ukoll.
This is my job.	Dan huwa xogħol tiegħi.
No, that's something.	Le, dik hija xi ħaġa.
You did nothing.	Inti ma għamilt xejn.
But you can't.	Imma ma tistax.
I don’t know why, but we did.	Ma nafx għaliex, imma għamilna.
He saw what it was.	Huwa ra dak li kien.
But we are.	Imma aħna.
You want to stay here with us.	Trid toqgħod hawn magħna.
Or supposed to.	Jew suppost.
And a friend to all.	U ħabib għal kulħadd.
It works pretty well.	Jaħdem pjuttost tajjeb.
No, it can't be.	Le, ma jistax ikun.
He didn't even have money.	Lanqas ma kellu flus.
He seemed too young.	Huwa deher żgħir wisq.
Maybe she would.	Forsi hekk kienet tagħmel hi.
This worked well.	Dan kien jaħdem tajjeb.
Easy to make.	Faċli biex tagħmel.
If you want to go, you have to go.	Jekk trid tmur, trid tmur.
I hope it wasn’t me.	Jien nittama li ma kontx jien.
It would be on the back.	Kieku fuq wara.
For me it was.	Għalija kien.
She comes back.	Hija tiġi lura.
I want to be something.	Irrid inkun xi ħaġa.
Now nothing was right.	Issa xejn ma kien kif suppost.
It was just.	Kien biss.
That was too much.	Dan kien wisq.
But there you have it.	Imma hemm għandek.
No one will be watching.	Ħadd mhu se jkun qed jara.
It was very bad.	Kien ħażin ħafna.
Maybe not so bad.	Forsi mhux daqshekk ħażin.
We were early.	Konna kmieni.
Do you know where this was?	Taf fejn kien dan?
That’s for sure as much as possible.	Dak huwa ċert kemm jista 'jkun.
Can anyone help please ???.	Jista' xi ħadd jgħin jekk jogħġbok???.
It will never do.	Qatt mhu se tagħmel.
He was working a lot like everyone else was working a lot.	Huwa kien qed jaħdem ħafna bħal kulħadd kien qed jaħdem ħafna.
But not good.	Imma mhux tajjeb.
Just not now.	Biss mhux issa.
You account.	Int kont.
Come on.	Ejja.
And now, it may be too late.	U issa, jista 'jkun tard wisq.
It happens, it is.	Dan jiġri, huwa.
He started thinking about leaving.	Beda jaħseb biex jitlaq.
I do nothing and neither do you.	Jien ma nagħmel xejn u lanqas int.
He eats well, but says little.	Jiekol tajjeb, imma ftit jgħid.
You need this.	Għandek bżonn dan.
It would have been much easier.	Kien ikun ħafna aktar faċli.
Maybe he hadn’t gone enough.	Forsi ma kienx mar biżżejjed.
Now back.	Issa lura.
Try to understand how.	Jipprova nifhem kif.
Maybe a long time ago.	Forsi twil ilu.
It was really great.	Kien tassew kbir.
For me, it was beautiful.	Għalija, kienet sabiħa.
But it is still there.	Imma għadu hemm.
It goes with everything.	Jmur ma’ kollox.
No, not so much.	Le, mhux hekk.
There was no way.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda mod.
I don’t like it anymore.	Ma nħobbx aktar.
It won't take anything.	Mhu se jieħu xejn.
So we want to do.	Hekk irridu li jagħmlu.
Or so it should.	Jew hekk għandu.
Everyone was friendly.	Kulħadd kien faċli.
We have enough of our own.	Għandna biżżejjed minn tagħna.
I want to be better.	Irrid inkun aħjar.
I wasn’t there.	Jien ma kontx hemm.
I want you to do this.	Irrid li tagħmel dan.
I had a good time, sure.	Kelli żmien tajjeb, żgur.
Today everyone does that.	Illum kulħadd jagħmel hekk.
I know it was.	Naf li kien.
I never went there.	Qatt ma mort hemm.
Many such things.	Ħafna affarijiet bħal dawn.
But only if you want to.	Imma biss jekk tixtieq.
Don't, don't have time.	M'għandekx, m'għandekx ħin.
He was supposed to be right.	Huwa suppost kellha raġun.
This is too little.	Dan huwa ftit wisq.
It seemed just enough to be there.	Deher li kien biżżejjed biss li jkun hemm.
Not nearly enough.	Mhux kważi biżżejjed.
Like not so hard.	Bħal mhux daqshekk diffiċli.
Come on in, take a look.	Ejja jekk tista’.
I could only do a little of that.	I jista 'biss nagħmel ftit minn dak.
And it usually is.	U normalment ikun.
I didn’t.	Jien ma kontx.
I have to go, I said.	Ikolli sejjer, għedt.
That was good too.	Dak kien tajjeb ukoll.
You can, of course, do this a few hours ahead of time.	Tista', ovvjament, tagħmel dan ftit sigħat qabel iż-żmien.
No one here has ever seen a car.	Ħadd hawn qatt ma ra karozza.
She will see that.	Hija ser tara li dan.
It wouldn’t be the last.	Ma kienx ikun l-aħħar.
I knew it would never be enough.	Kont naf li qatt ma kien se jkun biżżejjed.
It's so easy now.	Issa huwa daqshekk faċli.
I knew what it was going to be like.	Kont naf x’se jkun.
Keep working.	Jibqa' jaħdem.
Or it could be.	Jew jista 'jkun.
We hardly know why she goes.	Ma tantx nafu għaliex hi tmur.
Did you know there is.	Kont taf li hemm.
If anyone can help, it would be great.	Jekk xi ħadd jista 'jgħin, ikun kbir.
He wanted to live like a person.	Ried jgħix bħal persuna.
But it never came out.	Imma qatt ma ħareġ.
But really, it could be anything.	Imma tassew, tista’ tkun xi ħaġa.
I really hope you are right.	Verament nittama li għandek raġun.
He never does.	Hu qatt ma jagħmel.
Say nothing until you want to, and do nothing until needed.	Tgħid xejn sakemm ma tridx, u ma tagħmel xejn sakemm ikun hemm bżonn.
This should not happen again, everyone says.	Dan m’għandux jerġa’ jiġri, jgħid kulħadd.
It's that great.	Huwa dak kbir.
I would like to try.	Nixtieq nipprova.
No one knows why or how.	Ħadd ma jaf għaliex jew kif.
He loved being here today.	Kien iħobb li kien hawn illum.
I want to hear everything you can tell me.	Irrid nisma kull ma tista tgħidli.
But there was no time.	Imma ma kienx hemm ħin.
And now enough of that.	U issa biżżejjed minn dan.
I'm coming there.	Jien ġej hemm.
Not yet, not quite.	Għadha mhux, mhux pjuttost.
It’s time to have some fun.	Wasal iż-żmien li jieħu ftit gost.
Maybe it hadn’t happened so soon.	Forsi ma kienx ġara daqshekk hekk.
But today we will do so.	Imma llum se nagħmlu hekk.
As I was.	Kif kont.
I didn’t want to see it.	Ma ridtx nara.
Well we are.	Tajjeb aħna.
As bad as any.	Ħażin daqs kull.
Everything is as it should be.	Kollox huwa kif għandu jkun.
This will be so difficult.	Dan se jkun daqshekk diffiċli.
That’s not good enough.	Dak mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
He has a few friends.	Għandu ftit ħbieb.
I’m glad you said so, my friend.	Jien ferħan li għidt hekk, ħabib tiegħi.
But they do it too.	Imma jagħmlu dan ukoll.
It had started as early as one.	Kien beda kmieni kemm wieħed.
None of this was for us.	Xejn minn dan ma kien għalina.
It will definitely help.	Żgur li se jgħin.
It will be so.	Se jkun hekk.
I was too late.	Kont tard wisq.
But there it is.	Imma qiegħed hemm.
He just thought he had.	Huwa ħaseb biss li kellu.
And there is a problem.	U hemm problema.
Nothing can be out there.	Xejn jista’ jkun hemm barra.
I like to talk.	Inħobb nitkellem.
he asked.	staqsa.
She knew it wouldn’t be long, now.	Kienet taf li mhux se jkun twil, issa.
And they will do the same to me.	U se jagħmlu l-istess miegħi.
That's too bad.	Dak ħażin wisq.
She never will.	Hija qatt ma se.
And another.	U ieħor.
I didn’t even tell anyone.	Lanqas kont għidt lil ħadd.
It would not have been there.	Ma kienx ikun hemm.
I see nothing wrong.	Ma nara xejn ħażin.
And of course it’s for me.	U ovvjament huwa għalija.
Definitely need some work here.	Żgur bżonn xi xogħol hawn.
He was quite interested.	Kien pjuttost interessat.
He won’t do it a year later.	Mhux se tagħmel dan sena wara.
They were here.	Kienu hawn.
Well, maybe one.	Ukoll, forsi wieħed.
It’s easy to see why this should be so.	Huwa faċli li wieħed jara għaliex dan għandu jkun hekk.
Why, he didn't know.	Għaliex, ma kienx jaf.
He would never do that.	Hu qatt ma kien jagħmel hekk.
It looked good to him.	Deher qisu tajjeb għalih.
It’s a really bad idea.	Hija idea tassew ħażina.
It was a really good thing for me.	Kienet tassew ħaġa tajba għalija.
This never happens.	Dan qatt ma jiġri.
Not so today.	Mhux hekk illum.
But everyone could tell what was going on.	Imma kulħadd seta’ jgħid x’kien qed jiġri.
He was right the first time.	Kellu raġun l-ewwel darba.
It was not ready yet.	Għadu ma kienx lest.
I love my dog.	Inħobb il-kelb tiegħi.
Just as he had.	Hekk kif kellu.
No one here would do that.	Ħadd hawn ma kien jagħmel hekk.
It happened a long time ago.	Ġara żmien twil ilu.
It has been there for quite some time now.	Ilu hemm għal żmien mhux ħażin issa.
So he loved to say my friend.	Hekk kien iħobb jgħid ħabib tiegħi.
There are both too many and too few.	Hemm kemm wisq kif ukoll ftit wisq.
It came together so quickly.	Ġie flimkien daqshekk malajr.
I needed to talk to you.	Kelli bżonn nitkellem miegħek.
I did a little time.	Għamilt ftit ħin.
It's that.	Huwa dak.
It seems like everyone was expecting this.	Jidher li kulħadd kien qed jistenna dan.
Or you want to do.	Jew tixtieq tagħmel.
Or someone else.	Jew xi ħadd ieħor.
Obviously we can’t do anything like that.	Ovvjament ma nistgħu nagħmlu xejn bħal dan.
I thought there was something wrong with me.	Ħsibt li kien hemm xi ħaġa ħażina miegħi.
Sit down.	Poġġa bilqiegħda.
Well, not really.	Ukoll, mhux verament.
When you eat.	Meta tiekol.
Not too much, really.	Mhux wisq, tassew.
We need each other.	Għandna bżonn lil xulxin.
He was lost.	Huwa kien tilef.
I think I did.	Naħseb li għamilt.
He must be tired!	Għandu jkun għajjien!
I was just thinking.	Kont biss naħseb.
Well, it seems to have gone very well.	Ukoll, jidher li mar tajjeb ħafna.
He couldn't even speak.	Lanqas seta’ jitkellem.
Have you heard before?	Smajt qabel?
If it wasn’t for him, he wouldn’t have done it.	Kieku ma kienx għalih, ma kinitx tagħmel dan.
I’m not going to talk to you about this.	Jien mhux se nitkellem miegħek dwar dan.
This is the last one.	Din hija l-aħħar waħda.
You really do.	Int verament tagħmel.
In fact, nothing happened.	Fil-fatt, ma ġara xejn.
It wasn’t just my doing.	Ma kienx biss tagħmel tiegħi.
He knew that, if anyone did.	Huwa kien jaf li, jekk xi ħadd għamel.
It never happened.	Qatt ma ġara.
But it wasn’t one.	Imma ma kienx wieħed.
But it is very late.	Imma huwa tard ħafna.
Ready ?.	Lest?.
I don't want anything.	Ma rrid xejn.
Or someone.	Jew xi ħadd.
What happened? 	X'ġara?
he asked.	staqsa.
That has never really happened before.	Li qatt ma ġara verament qabel.
I’m never alone.	Jien qatt waħdi.
If you are not, he will come back and try a little later.	Jekk m'intix, hu ser jiġi lura u jipprova ftit aktar tard.
But everything was still.	Imma kollox kien għadu.
It's hard to say now.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid issa.
I know you do.	Naf li tagħmel.
He's probably wearing it.	Huwa probabbilment ikun liebes tiegħu.
And for a while, she had.	U għal xi żmien, kellha.
And that was about it.	U dan kien dwar dan.
I have no idea how.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif.
Please be.	Jekk jogħġbok tiġi.
I thought it was my time.	Ħsibt li kien iż-żmien tiegħi.
We will be there.	Se nkunu hemm.
Not so bad.	Mhux daqshekk ħażin.
But it may not be.	Imma jista 'ma jkunx.
I think they are a good thing.	Naħseb li huma ħaġa tajba.
There must be.	Għandu jkun hemm.
It really works for me.	Għalija tassew jaħdem.
And it seems not.	U jidher li le.
This dog did so well.	Dan il-kelb għamel daqshekk tajjeb.
He will be back.	Huwa se jkun lura.
She is always there for me.	Hija dejjem hemm għalija.
Nothing was wrong.	Xejn ma kien ħażin.
Much more.	Ħafna aktar.
I wasn’t going home.	Jien ma kontx immur id-dar.
Until recently, no one knew who he was.	Sa ftit ilu, ħadd ma kien jaf min kien.
And maybe it was for you.	U forsi kien għalik.
It seems easy enough.	Jidher faċli biżżejjed.
But you are not taking anything.	Imma mhux qed tieħu xejn.
And not just an idea.	U mhux biss idea.
I say so all the time.	Jien ngħid hekk il-ħin kollu.
It’s too good for me.	Huwa tajjeb wisq għalija.
We knew each other very well.	Konna nafu lil xulxin tajjeb ħafna.
No one else may know.	Ħadd ieħor jista 'jkun jaf.
It is something that one can do or cannot do.	Hija xi ħaġa li wieħed jista' jagħmel jew ma jistax jagħmel.
I think this is pretty hard.	Naħseb dwar dan pjuttost diffiċli.
I don’t think there’s anything more we can do than that.	Ma naħsibx li hemm xi ħaġa aktar li nistgħu nagħmlu minn hekk.
Time, it seems, is never enough.	Iż-żmien, jidher li qatt ma hemm biżżejjed.
Well, that's what they are.	Ukoll, dan huwa dak li huma.
You have everything.	Għandek kollox.
He is not leaving.	Mhux hu li jitlaq.
You could say no one wanted to be there.	Tista’ tgħid li ħadd ma ried ikun hemm.
That's just it.	Hekk hi biss.
Whatever you want.	Tkun xi tkun tixtieq.
This was definitely a bad idea.	Din żgur kienet idea ħażina.
Unless it was.	Sakemm ma kinitx.
And he did for a while.	U għamel għal xi żmien.
He needs more money.	Huwa jkollu bżonn aktar flus.
I know you can't talk about it.	Naf li ma tistax titkellem dwarha.
I'm not there yet.	Jien għadni mhux hemm.
Also, it would be a good time.	Barra minn hekk, ikun żmien tajjeb.
But there really is no right or wrong.	Imma verament m'hemm l-ebda tajjeb jew ħażin.
Not that we knew at the time.	Mhux li dak iż-żmien konna nafu.
Not entirely sure what happened.	Mhux ċert għal kollox x'ġara.
Let me tell you something more.	Ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa aktar.
I wonder what will happen now.	Nistaqsi x'se jiġri issa.
It just won't happen.	Biss mhux se jiġri.
I tell you this.	Jien ngħidlek dan.
You can be worth it.	Tista 'tkun min.
I was alone that evening.	Jien kont waħdi dik il-lejla.
It doesn’t look good.	Ma jidhirx tajjeb.
From here it came.	Minn hawn ġie.
Something had happened here recently.	Xi ħaġa kienet ġara hawn dan l-aħħar.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
I think I did a good job.	Naħseb li għamilt xogħol tajjeb.
And what are you in now.	U dak li qed fi issa.
I take back a little of that.	Nieħu lura ftit minn dak.
These are things we know we know.	Dawn huma affarijiet li nafu li nafu.
You’ve only heard one.	Int smajt wieħed biss.
If not, well not.	Jekk le, ukoll ma.
He saw it, too.	Huwa ra dan, ukoll.
Now we know we can.	Issa nafu li nistgħu.
I wanted money.	Ridt flus.
He did it as fast as the first.	Huwa għamel dan malajr daqs l-ewwel.
Just go there.	Biss tmur hemm.
Someone else had died.	Xi ħadd ieħor kien miet.
Would you like to go with me?	Tixtieq tmur miegħi?
She is such a good person.	Hija persuna daqshekk tajba.
I think now you have what you wanted.	Naħseb li issa għandek dak li ridt.
For something really.	Għal xi ħaġa tassew.
We never did.	Qatt ma għamilna.
That’s good of course.	Dak tajjeb ovvjament.
I want to be your friend.	Irrid inkun ħabib tiegħek.
I was sure something was wrong.	Kont ċert li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
I didn't say anything.	Jien ma għedt xejn.
No one was there.	Ħadd ma kien hemm.
I’ve never been able to do that now.	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel hekk issa.
Definitely not.	Żgur li le.
I was not able to do that.	Ma kontx kapaċi nagħmel dan.
You can't do that now.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan issa.
Too much like one on one.	Wisq bħal wieħed fuq wieħed.
He is in his room.	Huwa fil-kamra tiegħu.
It works for me.	Qed jaħdem għalija.
We were almost.	Konna kważi.
And a lot has been done.	U sar ħafna.
All of us.	Kollha kemm aħna.
It would take forever to.	Ikun jieħu għal dejjem biex.
Years of time.	Snin ta’ żmien.
This is not easy for me to do.	Dan mhux faċli għalija li nagħmel.
Up and back.	Fuq u lura.
But not everything.	Imma mhux kollox.
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi mhux hekk.
This had already happened.	Dan kien diġà ġara.
Like he never wanted anything.	Bħal qatt ma ried xejn.
Everything was taking too long.	Kollox kien qed jieħu wisq żmien.
I want to sit down.	Irrid noqgħod bilqiegħda.
This seems to work.	Dan jidher li jaħdem.
I wish I knew that.	Nixtieq inkun naf dak.
But there were many things.	Imma kien hemm ħafna affarijiet.
I don’t want to be alone.	Ma rridx inkun waħdi.
It was a good thing he didn’t have.	Kienet ħaġa tajba li ma kellux.
It looked just right.	Deher eżatt kif suppost.
I just want to say.	Irrid ngħid biss.
I couldn’t help but do otherwise.	Ma stajtx ma nagħmel mod ieħor.
Or, so it seems.	Jew, hekk jidher.
He did.	Dan għamel.
I hope it happens but you never know.	Nispera li jiġri imma qatt ma tkun taf.
Something was wrong.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
I came for something else.	Ġejt għal xi ħaġa oħra.
I can’t believe it’s working so fast.	Ma nistax nemmen li qed jaħdem daqshekk malajr.
But maybe so too.	Imma forsi hekk ukoll.
The, the, the.	Le, le, le.
There will be.	Se jkun hemm.
It will be coming to your home.	Se jkun ġej id-dar tiegħek.
She was sitting alone.	Kienet bilqiegħda waħedha.
I’m still not sure.	Għadni m'inix ċert.
But that was wrong.	Imma dan kien ħażin.
Sunday after.	Ħadd wara.
Now we know what to do.	Issa nafu li jagħmlu.
But it wasn’t her.	Imma ma kinitx hi.
Surely this will not be the last time.	Żgur li din mhux se tkun l-aħħar darba.
No one comes or goes.	Ħadd ma jiġi jew imur.
This seems to have happened many years ago.	Dan jidher li ġara ħafna snin ilu.
He has been doing this for years.	Ilu jagħmel dan għal snin.
They were pretty easy.	Kienu pjuttost faċli.
You can go by.	Tista 'tmur minn.
As you know.	Kif taf.
I don't know who else it might be.	Ma nafx min ieħor jista’ jkun.
I really need that to happen.	I verament bżonn li jiġri.
I'm not surprised.	Jien mhux sorpriż.
It seems very certain.	Jidher ċert ħafna.
But in fact it was.	Imma fil-fatt kien kien.
It's too late for that now.	Huwa wisq tard għal dan issa.
Lots of things here.	Ħafna affarijiet hawn.
I can really talk to you.	Jien nista' verament nitkellem miegħek.
But it can be anything.	Imma jista’ jkun kollox.
Everything, every single thing, was wrong.	Kollox, kull ħaġa waħda, kienet ħażina.
Now he knew.	Issa kien jaf.
Just know this.	Biss taf dan.
I want to be out.	Irrid li jkun barra.
For more money.	Għal aktar flus.
It was late afternoon.	Kien tard wara nofsinhar.
I knew it couldn't be easy.	Kont naf li ma setax ikun faċli.
I needed a car.	Jien kelli bżonn karozza.
I'll be back tomorrow.	Jien ser inkun lura għada.
Lots of money.	Ħafna flus.
You should know this.	Għandek tkun taf dan.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
I can try.	Nista 'nipprova.
He didn’t know where she was.	Ma kienx ikun jaf fejn kienet.
He had no idea who he was.	Ma kellux idea ta’ min kien.
It was too late for that.	Kien tard wisq għal dan.
I was the problem.	Jien kont il-problema.
It's just too big.	Huwa biss kbir wisq.
You are doing well.	Int sejjer tajjeb.
Is it good ?.	Huwa tajjeb?.
First time here.	L-ewwel darba hawn.
We don’t have much time.	M'għandniex ħafna ħin.
He couldn’t help who he was.	Ma setax jgħin min kien.
I would be glad.	Inkun ferħan.
He was there alone.	Kien hemm waħdu.
Come back with me.	Ejja lura miegħi.
And you don’t know.	U ma tkunx taf.
There was never a problem.	Qatt ma kien hemm xi problema.
You know better than that.	Taf aħjar minn hekk.
I will go with you if you wish.	Immur miegħek jekk tixtieq.
I think there are a few things.	Naħseb li hemm ftit affarijiet.
I have to say there are many more things.	Ikolli ngħid li hemm ħafna u aktar affarijiet.
I'm still not.	Jien għadni ma.
It didn’t have to take long.	Ma kellux għalfejn jieħu ħafna żmien.
You see.	Qed tara.
There was one child, one child.	Kien hemm tifel wieħed, tifel.
He is never afraid.	Hu qatt ma jibża.
It was still very much there.	Kien għadu ħafna hemmhekk.
He was trying to speak.	Kien qed jipprova jitkellem.
I believe it will be.	Nemmen li se jkun.
I was wrong too.	Jien kont ħażin ukoll.
I understand that everyone was tired.	Nifhem li kulħadd kien għajjien.
Something else was wrong.	Xi ħaġa oħra kienet ħażina.
He had seen what he should not have seen.	Kien ra dak li ma kellux jara.
It was nothing much.	Ma kien xejn ħafna.
That's the way it should be.	Dak kif għandu jkun.
In fact, he didn’t even know why he was there.	Fil-fatt, lanqas biss kien jaf għaliex kien hemm.
I’ve never been able to do that.	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel hekk.
You either do it or you don’t.	Inti jew tagħmel dan jew ma tagħmilx.
But it's time to dump her and move on.	Imma wasal iż-żmien li din tmur.
I can't try.	Jien ma nistax nipprova.
I went to talk to him.	Mort nitkellem miegħu.
I don't have time to ask why.	M'għandix ħin biex nistaqsi għaliex.
If it were.	Kieku tkun.
Nothing was done.	Ma sar xejn.
And you want to be that way.	U tixtieq tkun hekk.
Few people are all one way or another.	Ftit nies huma kollha mod jew ieħor.
I know it’s late.	Naf li huwa tard.
I think this is a good thing.	Naħseb li din hija ħaġa tajba.
It was never mine.	Qatt ma kienet tiegħi.
Let me try.	Ħa nipprova.
But it will do more.	Imma se tagħmel aktar.
To be with me.	Li tkun miegħi.
The truth is not just one thing.	Il-verità mhix ħaġa waħda biss.
Same with this.	L-istess ma' dan.
He did something.	Għamel xi ħaġa.
It was great.	Kien kbir.
Well, not quite.	Ukoll, mhux pjuttost.
It wasn’t working.	Ma kienx jaħdem.
I think now.	Naħseb li issa.
We don’t even need your belongings.	M'għandniex bżonn lanqas ta' l-affarijiet tiegħek.
You wouldn’t want it to be that way.	Ma tkunx tixtieq li jkun hekk.
Well, that’s it, really.	Ukoll, dak hu, verament.
It has enough.	Għandu biżżejjed.
No one asked why.	Ħadd ma staqsa għaliex.
It was pretty easy.	Kien pjuttost faċli.
And maybe it won’t be around in a few years.	U forsi ma tkunx madwar fi ftit snin.
I want it to work well.	Irrid li jaħdem tajjeb.
I will buy another of these.	Jien se nixtri ieħor minn dawn.
They are people too.	Huma nies ukoll.
I could see where this was going.	Stajt nara fejn kien sejjer dan.
It didn’t have to happen.	Ma kellux jiġri.
If you want, of course.	Jekk trid, ovvjament.
I'm so tired!	Jien tant għajjien!
No one is around.	Ħadd mhu madwar.
He says he does.	Jgħid li jagħmel.
It must be someone else.	Għandu jkun xi ħadd ieħor.
I don’t do that.	Jien mhux nagħmel dan.
Many people have this problem.	Ħafna nies għandhom din il-problema.
Look a long time.	Ħares żmien twil.
It's the same time.	Huwa l-istess ħin.
Not even a little.	Lanqas ftit.
Not a chance.	Mhux ċans.
I'm just saying.	Jien biss ngħid.
No one really does.	Ħadd ma jagħmel verament.
It’s supposed to be something you know and something you have.	Suppost li tkun xi ħaġa li taf u xi ħaġa li għandek.
Or maybe when it was time he left.	Jew forsi meta wasal iż-żmien kien telaq.
You will be alone after that.	Int tkun waħdek wara dan.
So easy.	Faċli daqshekk.
You must have seen my house.	Għandek rajt id-dar tiegħi.
There was never enough money.	Qatt ma kien hemm biżżejjed flus.
This will not be like every other time.	Dan mhux se jkun bħal kull darba oħra.
It is more than that.	Huwa aktar minn hekk.
But this could not happen often.	Imma dan ma setax ġara spiss.
I’m telling you how here.	Qed ngħidlek kif hawn.
That was all she had to do.	Dan kien dak li kellha tagħmel.
Not that it should happen.	Mhux li għandu jiġri.
I can tell what you're thinking.	Nista’ ngħid x’qed taħseb.
We will be there soon.	Se nkunu hemm dalwaqt.
Well, you don’t need one.	Tajjeb, m'għandekx bżonn waħda.
It would be better if you.	Ikun aħjar kieku inti.
The problem is.	Il-problema hi.
She was beautiful, so beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa, tant sabiħa.
But there was a chance.	Imma kien hemm ċans.
It comes in handy.	Huwa ġej tajjeb.
But she's his.	Imma hi tiegħu.
But maybe he was too tired to play.	Imma forsi kien għajjien wisq biex jilgħab.
That will continue to happen.	Dak se jibqa’ jiġri.
And this is what you go for.	U dan huwa dak li inti tmur.
He had to come back by now.	Huwa kellu jiġi lura sa issa.
What is it? 	Dak X'inhu?
You can do anything, there.	Inti tista 'tagħmel xi ħaġa, hemmhekk.
Not everyone can.	Mhux kulħadd jista’.
She needed help and quickly.	Hija kellha bżonn għajnuna u malajr.
I’ll tell you exactly the same thing.	Jien ngħidlek eżatt l-istess ħaġa.
This could not be happening.	Dan ma setax qed jiġri.
I know who he is.	Naf min hu.
That works well.	Dan jagħmel tajjeb.
Someone who was up to nothing good.	Xi ħadd li kien sa xejn tajjeb.
I did nothing.	Jien ma għamilt xejn.
That's just what's happening.	Huwa biss dak li qed jiġri.
Good on great work as always.	Tajjeb fuq xogħol kbir bħal dejjem.
This is it.	Dan hu.
Maybe I did something else.	Forsi għamilt xi ħaġa oħra.
But it has never been done before.	Imma qatt ma sar qabel.
You want to sit down.	Trid toqgħod bilqiegħda.
He was surprised.	Huwa kien sorpriż.
I think about a lot of things.	Naħseb dwar ħafna affarijiet.
It had to happen that way.	Kellu jiġri hekk.
It was his home.	Kienet id-dar tiegħu.
It seemed that.	Huwa deher li.
It was much better now but I never saw it coming.	Kien ħafna aħjar issa imma qatt ma ra dan ġej.
You.	Inti.
Nor do we need to.	Lanqas għandna bżonn.
Where did everyone go?	Fejn mar kulħadd?
And not just her.	U mhux hi biss.
Too many problems.	Wisq problemi.
I think this is not good.	Naħseb li dan mhux tajjeb.
He had to be mine.	Huwa kellu jkun tiegħi.
Now she was here.	Issa kienet hawn.
I was so sure about it.	Kont tant ċert dwarha.
I am good alone.	Jiena tajjeb waħdi.
A man alone.	Raġel waħdu.
He had done so.	Huwa kien għamel hekk.
I never knew something like this would happen.	Qatt ma kont naf li jiġri xi ħaġa bħal din.
I should be.	I għandu jkun.
My friend told me that everything was going to be fine.	Ħabib tiegħi qalli li kollox kien se jkun tajjeb.
Not once.	Lanqas darba.
It was probably working.	Probabbilment kien qed jaħdem.
I don’t even know.	Jien lanqas jien ma nafx.
You can't just go.	Ma tistax tmur biss.
I shouldn’t do that.	M'għandix nagħmel dan.
Is this what you see on your own ?.	Dan huwa dak li tara fuq tiegħek?.
It's time.	Wasal iż-żmien.
He may not be.	Huwa jista 'ma jkunx.
Please need help.	Jekk jogħġbok għandek bżonn l-għajnuna.
We knew there had to be a better way.	Konna nafu li kellu jkun hemm mod aħjar.
It was so hard.	Kien daqshekk diffiċli.
He was never our friend.	Qatt ma kien ħabib tagħna.
We don’t need help.	M'għandniex bżonn għajnuna.
He really knows all of these.	Huwa tassew jaf kollox minn dawn.
This is a beautiful one.	Din hija waħda sabiħa.
It’s just my idea.	Hija biss idea tiegħi.
I just wanted a little.	Ridt biss ftit.
She was a person.	Kienet persuna.
I want both.	Irrid it-tnejn.
But that doesn’t seem to be happening here.	Imma dan ma jidhirx li qed jiġri hawn.
I’m surprised how well he’s doing.	Jien sorpriż kemm sejjer tajjeb.
You will not make much money doing this.	Inti mhux se tagħmel ħafna flus tagħmel dan.
He knew it was coming.	Kien jaf li kien ġej.
Who we were.	Min konna ‘aħna’.
But there is something else, too.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
This is the first one.	Din hija l-ewwel waħda.
She did nothing.	Ma għamlet xejn.
But he was right.	Imma kellu raġun kbir.
I don’t even want to do that.	Lanqas irrid nagħmel dan.
I really like going.	Inħobb ħafna mmur.
It was not the same.	Ma kienx l-istess.
It wasn't.	Ma kienx.
I don’t know who had the first one, really.	Ma nafx min kellu l-ewwel wieħed, tassew.
I had to think.	Kelli naħseb.
You don’t want to go either.	Ma tridx tmur lanqas.
But it doesn’t work that way.	Imma mhux hekk jaħdem.
No maybe about it.	Le forsi dwarha.
Try to do it.	Ipprova tagħmel dan.
He didn’t have to.	Ma kellux għalfejn.
This is just great.	Dan huwa biss kbir.
They are fast too.	Huma malajr ukoll.
It's not good.	Mhuwiex tajjeb.
He always came back.	Dejjem ġie lura.
Obviously he doesn’t know.	Ovvjament ma jafx.
There you are.	Hemmhekk int.
Well, not all help.	Ukoll, mhux l-għajnuna kollha.
Nothing went well.	Xejn mar tajjeb.
Not something like that.	Mhux xi ħaġa hekk.
You have a year.	Għandek sena.
Sometimes, it works.	Xi drabi, jaħdem.
I say no.	Jien ngħid le.
And it can help.	U jista 'jgħin.
Come on, everyone.	Ejja, kulħadd.
It's easy to please.	Hija faċli biex jekk jogħġbok.
We can't.	Aħna ma nistgħux.
Now I know what he's thinking.	Issa naf x’qed jaħseb.
I have to do it myself.	Ikolli nagħmel dan jien.
So be it.	Hekk ikun.
Here is our home.	Hawn id-dar tagħna.
He seems unable to leave.	Jidher li ma jistax jitlaq.
There I am right there.	Hemm jien eżatt hemm.
I can't see how bad it can be for you.	Ma nistax nara kif jista’ jkun ħażin għalik.
He was so tired.	Kien tant għajjien.
And it should.	U għandu.
I think about it too much.	Naħseb dwarha wisq.
Or maybe not.	Jew hi forsi le.
Want to see how it's done ?.	Trid tara kif isir?.
But it could be a bad thing.	Imma tista’ tkun xi ħaġa ħażina.
Well, no more.	Ukoll, mhux aktar.
And it was easy to do.	U kien faċli li tagħmel.
Before many people.	Qabel ħafna nies.
And it often is.	U spiss ikun.
Something really goes until it looks good.	Xi ħaġa verament tmur sakemm jidher tajjeb.
There must be something wrong.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa ħażina.
But there is something else before you go.	Imma hemm ħaġa oħra qabel ma tmur.
I've been thinking.	Stajt naħseb.
It was very hard to see.	Kien diffiċli ħafna biex tara.
This is your last chance!	Dan huwa l-aħħar ċans tiegħek!
It seems to work well.	Jidher li jaħdem tajjeb.
We may know.	Nistgħu nkunu nafu.
It won’t happen tomorrow, but it will come.	Mhux se jiġri għada, imma se jiġi.
And do it, over and over and over.	U tagħmel dan, aktar u aktar u aktar.
It won’t be me.	Mhux se nkun jien.
It will take people.	Se tieħu nies.
You don’t just go out like that!	Inti mhux biss tmur barra hekk!
He really couldn’t do that.	Huwa verament ma setax jagħmel dan.
It's for everyone.	Huwa għal kulħadd.
I've seen why.	Stajt nara għaliex.
He can do as he pleases.	Jista’ jagħmel kif irid.
That's just it.	Hekk hu biss.
Everything seemed easy.	Kollox deher li kien faċli.
But he wouldn’t tell anyone.	Imma ma kien jgħid lil ħadd.
Probably something I never did.	Probabbilment xi ħaġa li qatt ma għamilt.
He thought so too.	Huwa ħaseb hekk ukoll.
It doesn’t have to be just now.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun biss issa.
But you never were.	Imma int qatt ma ġejt.
Plus, it was the last thing he wanted.	Barra minn hekk, kienet l-aħħar ħaġa li ried.
He was trouble-free for a year or so.	Huwa kien bla problemi għal sena jew hekk.
You were great.	Inti kont kbir.
He's gone now.	Huwa mar issa.
I thought he did.	Ħsibt li għamel.
There was only one man, and only one man.	Kienu hemm raġel wieħed, u raġel wieħed biss.
And the previous one.	U dak ta’ qabel.
Or not at all.	Jew mhux għal kollox.
Obviously, someone had.	Ovvjament, xi ħadd kellu.
You see.	Qed tara.
One knows another.	Wieħed jaf ieħor.
Nothing was too big or too small.	Xejn ma kien kbir wisq jew żgħir wisq.
It will be quite difficult.	Se jkun pjuttost diffiċli.
I thought it was great.	Ħsibt li kien kbir.
This is very easy to do.	Dan huwa faċli ħafna li tagħmel.
There are a lot of people.	Hemm ħafna nies.
It was both.	Kien it-tnejn.
I believe my time has come.	Nemmen li wasal iż-żmien tiegħi.
It is not enough.	Mhuwiex biżżejjed.
I was thinking you were right.	Kont qed naħseb li għandek raġun.
So she did.	Hekk għamlet.
They were nothing to me.	Ma kienu xejn għalija.
Now it seemed he was going to have to do it.	Issa deher li kien se jkollu jagħmel dan.
Definitely not for me.	Żgur li ma kienx għalija.
You will make a lot of friends here.	Inti se tagħmel ħafna ħbieb hawn.
He was glad she did.	Huwa kien kuntent li hija għamlet hekk.
He just knew he didn’t want to be alone.	Kien jaf biss li ma riedx ikun waħdu.
He knew that.	Kien ikun jaf li.
Sure,	Żgur,
You go where you want to go.	Inti tmur fejn trid tmur.
He had thought about how she looked.	Huwa kien ħaseb dwar kif kienet tidher.
I don't know what's going on.	Ma nafx x’qed jiġri.
He is playing very well.	Huwa qed jilgħab tajjeb ħafna.
It was my job.	Kien ix-xogħol tiegħi.
It's been a long time coming.	Għadu żmien twil minn meta ra.
He knew.	Huwa kien jaf.
But not there.	Imma mhux hemmhekk.
He was happy to do so.	Huwa kien kuntent li jagħmel hekk.
If you can talk about it.	Jekk tista' titkellem dwarha.
It would be the first time, if so.	Ikun l-ewwel darba, kieku hekk.
I can't even be a friend.	Lanqas nista’ nkun ħabib.
That wasn’t good enough.	Dak ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed.
If you want to go, let’s go.	Jekk trid tmur, ejja mmorru.
I said this same thing here.	Jien għidt din l-istess ħaġa hawn.
Do you want to come together?	Tixtieq tiġi flimkien?
We only had one car.	Kellna karozza waħda biss.
Well, he would come to me later.	Ukoll, kien jiġi lili aktar tard.
Well, that's it.	Ukoll, dan huwa.
They are around.	Huma madwar.
She will be here too.	Hija ser tkun hawn ukoll.
It never happens.	Qatt ma jiġri.
Only now was it not there.	Biss issa ma kienx hemm.
It was good for me.	Kien tajjeb għalija.
But now it was too late.	Imma issa kien tard wisq.
I have a good one.	Għandi tajba.
He needed to plan.	Kellu bżonn jippjana.
It was a good job.	Kien xogħol tajjeb.
He looked back.	Huwa ħares lura.
Everything works fine.	Kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
He did nothing.	Ma għamel xejn.
And everything went well.	U kollox mar tajjeb.
I don’t want him to leave yet.	Ma rridx li jitlaq għadu.
It happened.	Ġie ġara.
It's early.	Huwa kmieni.
That's work.	Dak hu xogħol.
They were almost there.	Kienu kważi hemm.
She didn't know where.	Ma kinitx taf fejn.
She was always really good to me.	Hija dejjem kienet tassew tajba miegħi.
I would say so for him as well.	Jien ngħid hekk għalih ukoll.
He wasn’t my dog.	Ma kienx il-kelb tiegħi.
You should be, too.	Għandek tkun, ukoll.
I think he is.	Naħseb li hu.
Well, not for you.	Ukoll, mhux għalik.
And it will continue to be.	U jibqa’ jkun.
Look before it's too late.	Ħares qabel ma jkun tard wisq.
Much more in fact.	Ħafna aktar fil-fatt.
One thing was for sure.	Ħaġa waħda kienet żgur.
I need to talk to you about some things.	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek dwar xi affarijiet.
They were his.	Kienu tiegħu.
I didn’t.	Jien ma kontx.
Say nothing.	Tgħid xejn.
And he knows everything.	U jaf kollox.
I want another chance.	Irrid ċans ieħor.
Some people have this.	Xi nies għandhom dan.
I'm still alone.	Għadni biss.
Not yet for years.	Għadu mhux għal snin.
There is nothing.	M'hemm xejn.
This was not going to happen.	Dan ma kienx se jiġri.
I want to be someone we know.	Nixtieq li jkun xi ħadd li nafu.
I don’t want to be here.	Ma rridx hawn.
He doesn’t like it that way.	Hu ma jħobbx hekk.
Or as good as.	Jew tajjeb daqs.
This would have made it all much more difficult.	Dan kien jagħmel dan kollu ħafna aktar diffiċli.
It's so good.	Huwa daqshekk tajjeb.
But there it was.	Imma kien hemm.
I'm glad you're around.	Jien kuntent li int madwar.
But no one really knows.	Imma ħadd ma jaf verament.
Now you are not.	Issa m'intix.
I'm very sorry	Jiddispjaċini ħafna
I said so, boy.	Jien għidt hekk, tifel.
I think she was right about that.	Naħseb li kellha raġun dwar dan.
It's not very good.	Mhuwiex tajjeb ħafna.
She had to go someday.	Kellha tmur xi darba.
Someone who was good.	Xi ħadd li kien tajjeb.
No, you don't.	Le, m'għandekx.
I want to know.	Irrid inkun naf.
They are pretty	Huma pjuttost
I was there.	Kont hemm.
This is my last chance.	Dan huwa l-aħħar ċans tiegħi.
And she knew that.	U hi kienet taf li.
Time has passed.	Iż-żmien għadda.
She will come here.	Hija se tiġi hawn.
This is for me.	Din hija għalija.
I thought it was you.	Ħsibt li kont int.
That was good to see.	Dan kien tajjeb biex tara.
You don’t need to think either.	M'għandekx bżonn taħseb lanqas.
I think it’s a man’s thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa ta' raġel.
I hope it goes well.	Nispera li sejjer tajjeb.
He came home.	Wasal id-dar.
What is it all about ?.	X'inhu dak kollu dwar?.
But he knew.	Imma kien jaf.
I doubt it will be easy.	Niddubita li se jkun faċli.
And you must be.	U trid tkun.
It would have been later than that.	Kien ikun aktar tard minn hekk.
It all seems to have happened before.	Jidher li dan kollu ġara qabel.
I never thought you could do that.	Qatt ma ħsibt li tista’ tagħmel dan.
Maybe none of these work.	Forsi ħadd minn dawn ma jaħdem.
I really want to talk to you.	Irrid verament nitkellem miegħek.
You will never come back.	Inti qatt ma lura.
You are not what they are.	M'intix dak li huma.
And before too long.	U qabel wisq żmien.
Not there, but there.	Mhux hemm, imma hemm.
You know what you want.	Taf li trid.
Very very very much.	Ħafna ħafna ħafna.
If you do so.	Jekk tagħmel hekk.
So it must be.	Hekk għandu jkun.
Don't do that.	Tagħmilx hekk.
We can go home.	Nistgħu mmorru d-dar.
I'm not so sure.	M'inix daqshekk ċert.
You have to think about it.	Trid taħseb dwar dan.
I knew this could happen.	Kont naf li dan jista’ jiġri.
We are someone.	Aħna xi ħadd.
But that’s me.	Imma dak jien.
I knew it would be good.	Kont naf li se jkun tajjeb.
Well, that must have been a good time ago.	Ukoll, dan għandu jkun żmien tajjeb ilu.
We never had.	Qatt ma kellna.
Until you are ready to do something about it.	Sakemm tkun lest li tagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
But he couldn’t do it.	Imma ma setax jagħmel dan.
I'm going home.	Jien se mmur id-dar.
I knew it was done.	Jien kont naf li sar.
We can do this together.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan flimkien.
This, not so much.	Dan, mhux daqshekk.
I need to know how this happened.	Għandi bżonn inkun naf kif ġara dan.
I hope you are right with that.	Nispera li inti tajjeb ma 'dak.
One, not many.	Wieħed, mhux ħafna.
I was buying here.	Jien kont nixtri hawn.
One says this and another says so.	Wieħed jgħid dan u ieħor jgħid hekk.
It is much easier to stay home.	Huwa ħafna aktar faċli li toqgħod id-dar.
He told me so.	Qalli ngħid hekk.
It gets difficult.	Jiġi diffiċli.
If so, it would probably be wrong.	Kieku hekk, probabbilment isir ħażin.
That was what happened.	Hekk kien ġara.
I didn’t expect that to happen.	Ma kontx nistenna li jiġri hekk.
He will be like one.	Hu ser jiġi bħal wieħed.
He had it.	Kellu dan.
Lots of time to think.	Ħafna ħin biex taħseb.
We want what we don't have.	Irridu dak li m’għandniex.
How are you.	Kif inti.
This is the last one.	Din hija l-aħħar waħda.
And still not enough.	U għadu mhux biżżejjed.
Better looks.	Aħjar jistenna.
I can’t really do that now.	Ma nistax verament tagħmel dan issa.
There he waits.	Hemmhekk jistenna.
That's not what.	Dak mhux dak.
He was on.	Huwa kien fuq.
I think we had had enough.	Naħseb li kellna biżżejjed.
It usually is.	Huwa normalment huwa.
I did it.	Jien għamilt dan.
Time is tough.	Iż-żmien huwa diffiċli.
I had to be ready.	Kelli nkun lest.
You do everything you are supposed to do.	Inti tagħmel dak kollu li suppost tagħmel.
I never did that.	Qatt ma għamilt hekk.
No one is supposed to know.	Ħadd mhu suppost jaf.
I love his job.	Inħobb ix-xogħol tiegħu.
And we are.	U aħna.
That’s something, he thinks.	Dik hija xi ħaġa, jaħseb.
You have to go back.	Għandek tmur lura.
But it didn’t have to be good.	Imma ma kellux għalfejn ikun tajjeb.
He didn’t expect it would take so long.	Ma kienx jistenna li kien se jieħu daqshekk twil.
You have to make sure you have everything.	Għandek tkun ċert li għandek kollox.
It works for me.	Qed jaħdem għalija.
Quick.	Malajr.
I'm happy.	Jien kuntent.
But that would be wrong.	Imma dan ikun ħażin.
You don’t do that.	Ma tagħmilx dan.
I wasn’t trying to be late.	Ma kontx nipprova nkun tard.
He doesn’t think about it.	Huwa ma jaħsibx dwar dan.
It’s easy to see why this is so.	Huwa faċli li wieħed jara għaliex dan huwa hekk.
I come from one.	Jien ġej minn wieħed.
But, please, tell no one.	Imma, jekk jogħġbok, tgħid lil ħadd.
He really did it.	Huwa tassew għamel dan.
I know you will.	Naf li inti se.
I know what it looks like.	Naf kif tidher.
How are you.	Kif int.
And he may have been right.	U seta’ kellu raġun.
I think you will be fine.	Naħseb li inti tkun tajjeb.
It's beforehand.	Huwa minn qabel.
You know what's out there.	Inti taf x'inhu hemmhekk.
I’m not like everyone else.	Jien mhux bħal kulħadd.
She now had friends.	Issa kellha ħbieb.
And, he is probably right.	U, huwa probabbilment raġun.
We know that now.	Nafu li issa.
I don't think anyone can.	Ma naħsibx li ħadd jista’.
That’s what we really are here for.	Dak hu li aħna verament hawn.
But nothing had happened.	Imma ma kien ġara xejn.
He saw that now.	Huwa ra li issa.
It will take more work.	Se jieħu aktar xogħol.
It seemed to be.	Deher li kien.
I hope we are friends.	Nispera li nkunu ħbieb.
I'm happy here.	Jien kuntent hawn.
Let's go on.	Ejja mmorru fuq.
He doesn't know why.	Ma jafx għalfejn.
And this is not going to work.	U dan mhux sejjer jaħdem.
Money, for one thing.	Flus, għal ħaġa waħda.
He knows he can do it.	Jaf li jista’ jagħmel dan.
In fact he never does.	Fil-fatt qatt ma jagħmel hekk.
They do things.	Huma jagħmlu l-affarijiet.
Much more on this tomorrow.	Ħafna aktar dwar dan għada.
And she had to.	U kellha.
Look out.	Ħares barra.
There is no one else.	M'hemm ħadd ieħor.
I think it’s time.	Naħseb li wasal iż-żmien.
I definitely need both.	Żgur li għandi bżonn it-tnejn.
But we can't.	Imma ma nistgħux.
He can't stay here.	Ma jistax jibqa’ hawn.
No one does it better.	Ħadd ma jagħmel dan aħjar.
You can take what you want.	Tista' tieħu dak kif tixtieq.
In fact, too.	Fil-fatt, wisq.
Look back at me, right here.	Ħares lura tiegħi, eżatt hawn.
So do you.	Hekk tagħmel int.
You are a teacher.	Int għalliem.
It wasn’t very pretty.	Ma kinitx sabiħa ħafna.
I have no idea.	Għandi l-ebda idea.
He probably does the same thing.	Huwa probabbilment jagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
And this is taking too much.	U dan qed jieħu għal kollox wisq.
This, more and more.	Dan, aktar u aktar.
How do you do.	Kif tagħmel int.
I say friend.	Jien ngħid ħabib.
If you already know, great.	Jekk diġà taf, kbir.
That would be really great.	Dan ikun verament kbir.
No one wants the truth.	Ħadd ma jrid il-verità.
Someone has to do something about it.	Xi ħadd għandu jagħmel xi ħaġa dwar dan.
I should be able to do that.	Għandi nkun kapaċi nagħmel dan.
He agreed quickly.	Huwa qabel malajr.
You can do anything.	Tista' tagħmel xi ħaġa.
Same as yours.	L-istess bħal tiegħek.
He could not leave.	Ma setax telaq.
I’m just not fast enough.	Jien biss mhux malajr biżżejjed.
No one seemed able to think much of what he says.	Ħadd ma deher kapaċi jaħseb ħafna xi jgħid.
If something is wrong, can you tell me?	Jekk xi ħaġa ħażina, tista’ tgħidli?
I’m not even sure it works.	Jien lanqas ċert li jaħdem.
But he didn’t want to.	Imma ma riedx.
That wasn’t so bad.	Dak ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
Every once in a while.	Kull darba waħda.
Now I believe she was right.	Issa nemmen li kellha raġun.
I was you.	Kont int.
She had an idea.	Kellha idea.
He knew we were there.	Kien jaf li konna hemm.
I love work.	Inħobb ix-xogħol.
One man.	Raġel wieħed.
More than ever.	Aktar minn qatt qabel.
Home is home.	Id-dar hija d-dar.
What I said.	Dak li għidt.
I hope there is a better way to do this.	Nispera li jkun hemm mod aħjar kif isir dan.
And it did so in just three years.	U għamlet dan fi tliet snin biss.
There must be.	Għandu jkun hemm.
But maybe you should too.	Imma forsi għandek ukoll.
A way to see who can play.	Mod kif tara min jista' jilgħab.
And that was enough.	U dan kien biżżejjed.
I still think about it.	Għadni naħseb dwarha.
He was tired of living alone.	Kien għajjien jgħix waħdu.
This is a sure one.	Dan huwa wieħed żgur.
I haven’t been back since.	Minn dak iż-żmien ma kontx ġejt lura.
It’s time to do something already.	Wasal iż-żmien li tagħmel xi ħaġa diġà.
No one can prove anything.	Ħadd ma jkun jista’ jipprova xejn.
I just didn't want to be scared.	Jien biss ma ridtx nibża’.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Kien jaf eżatt x’kien qed jagħmel.
I'm going now.	Immur issa.
What he did.	Dak li għamel.
In fact, it could be more.	Fil-fatt, jista 'jkun aktar.
Well, now she did.	Ukoll, issa għamlet.
I do this again.	Nagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
Something will happen.	Se jiġri xi ħaġa.
So he says there.	Hekk qed jgħid hemmhekk.
I’m here for this.	Jien hawn għal dan.
Nor will it ever be.	Lanqas qatt mhu se jkun.
She has never been like this.	Qatt ma hi bħal din.
You are doing something to me.	Qed tagħmel xi ħaġa lili.
But it could be.	Imma jista’ jkun.
Just one thing to do.	Ħaġa waħda biss biex nagħmlu.
He really did his best.	Huwa tassew għamel dak kollu li seta’.
No, she wouldn't.	Le, hi ma tkunx.
I would like to know.	Nixtieq inkun naf.
I never will.	Jien qatt ma se.
Every little bit helps.	Kull ftit jgħin.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kinitx.
You want to know how to do it.	Trid tkun taf kif tagħmel dan.
He leaves me.	Huwa jitlaq miegħi.
That's quite a lot of money.	Dak huwa pjuttost ħafna flus.
And mine, well, mine was really good.	U tiegħi, ukoll, tiegħi kien tassew tajjeb.
And everything is ready.	U kollox lest.
To be better.	Biex tkun aħjar.
No one knows for sure.	Ħadd ma jaf żgur.
He would be my first.	Hu jkun l-ewwel tiegħi.
This happened in.	Dan ġara fi.
I will be here.	Jien se nkun hawn.
He had seen what was there.	Huwa kien ra dak li kien hemm.
But you know how it goes.	Imma taf kif tmur.
You’re talking about something else now.	Qed titkellem dwar xi ħaġa oħra issa.
It will be quite because he is not actually out here.	Se jkun pjuttost għaliex hu fil-fatt mhux hawn barra.
That’s not a bad thing.	Dik mhix xi ħaġa ħażina.
For a few years.	Għal ftit snin.
In fact it is more difficult than that.	Fil-fatt huwa aktar diffiċli minn hekk.
I never knew he would be so happy.	Qatt ma kont naf li jkun daqshekk ferħan.
It was still early.	Kien għadu kmieni.
And it won't be.	U mhux se jkun.
A man had died.	Raġel kien miet.
That was a bit difficult.	Dak kien daqsxejn diffiċli.
I was a man now.	Kont raġel issa.
Not the last either.	Mhux l-aħħar lanqas.
I will tell you about this later.	I se ngħidlek dwar dan aktar tard.
Maybe we’ll never know for sure.	Forsi qatt ma nkunu nafu żgur.
I don’t know what it is.	Ma nafx x'inhu.
You know.	Int tkun taf.
Come with us.	Ejja magħna.
I didn’t want too much.	Ma ridtx wisq.
No one ever said anything.	Ħadd qatt ma qal xejn.
That's how it turned out.	Hekk ħareġ.
That would have been good.	Dan kien ikun tajjeb.
There we were.	Hemmhekk konna.
I can't talk to him.	Ma nistax nitkellem miegħu.
I was quite happy.	Kont pjuttost kuntent.
And so it still is today.	U hekk għadu llum.
And she was there too.	U hi kienet hemm ukoll.
Time has passed.	Iż-żmien għadda.
Or don’t you just think you see.	Jew lanqas biss taħseb biss tara.
I can go back another time.	Nista’ nerġa’ lura ħin ieħor.
I think in my room.	Naħseb fil-kamra tiegħi.
I did too.	Jien għamilt ukoll.
Now no one lived there.	Issa ħadd ma kien jgħix hemm.
But now you know.	Imma issa taf.
Why are you.	Għaliex int.
And he didn’t have the things to do it.	U ma kellux l-affarijiet biex jagħmel dan.
I have no idea how to do that.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif tagħmel dan.
I wasn’t doing that.	Jien ma kontx nagħmel dan.
It's getting better.	Qed isir aħjar.
For a while.	Għal xi żmien.
No one lived here.	Ħadd ma kien jgħix hawn.
No one knows for sure who she was.	Ħadd ma jaf żgur min kienet.
Just what is happening.	Eżatt dak li qed jiġri.
He wanted to be.	Ried ikun.
I think everyone knows this.	Naħseb li kulħadd jaf dan.
I didn’t want to talk to him either.	Ma ridtx nitkellem miegħu lanqas.
You are never alone.	Inti qatt ma waħdek.
But he only wanted to do one.	Imma ried jagħmel wieħed biss.
To see is to know, and to know is to see.	Li tara huwa li tkun taf, u li tkun taf hija li tara.
We know where you are.	Nafu fejn int.
Well now no more.	Ukoll issa mhux aktar.
One can only hope so.	Wieħed jista’ biss jittama li hekk.
He will do nothing.	Mhu se jagħmel xejn.
He wanted to know what you were thinking.	Ried ikun jaf x’qed taħseb.
But this is me.	Imma dan hu minni.
This will not work.	Dan mhux se jaħdem.
Let's go back.	Ejja mmorru lura.
I had to sit down and think about it.	Kelli noqgħod bilqiegħda u naħseb dwar dan.
It's a bar.	Se barra.
I thought you would be interested.	Ħsibt li inti tkun interessat.
This can be good or bad.	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb jew ħażin.
You have time.	Għandek ħin.
It goes as follows.	Hija tmur kif ġej.
This is not difficult, either.	Dan mhuwiex diffiċli, lanqas.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
When will it be ready.	Meta se jkun lest.
It's great too.	Huwa kbir ukoll.
It's again.	Huwa mill-ġdid.
This was his last and only chance.	Dan kien l-aħħar u l-uniku ċans tiegħu.
Things you should know, and now you know so well.	Affarijiet li għandek tkun taf, u issa taf daqshekk tajjeb.
I think soon.	Naħseb li dalwaqt.
Just not everyone does.	Biss mhux kulħadd jagħmel.
I still actually.	Għadni fil-fatt.
That's as good as it gets.	Dak hu tajjeb kemm jista’ jkun.
And now he has to.	U issa għandu.
There are other things.	Hemm affarijiet oħra.
He will do his best to survive.	Huwa se jagħmel minn kollox biex jgħix.
Well, that has happened now and there is nothing we can do about it.	Ukoll, dan ġara issa u m'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu dwar dan.
There are many.	Hemm ħafna.
It's so much more.	Huwa ħafna aktar.
Or something more.	Jew xi ħaġa aktar.
And it seems likely that it will.	U jidher probabbli li se.
Minix.	Minix.
That says something.	Li tgħid xi ħaġa.
I didn’t think anyone.	Ma kont naħseb li ħadd.
But it went further.	Imma mar aktar.
They never did.	Huma qatt ma.
You have no idea how much.	M'għandekx idea kemm.
He knows she will be late.	Jaf li hi se tkun tard.
It was actually pretty good.	Fil-fatt kien pjuttost tajjeb.
It's too good to be.	Huwa wisq tajjeb biex tkun.
I wish there was more to it than that.	Nixtieq li jkun hemm aktar minn dak hemmhekk.
Not a little.	Mhux ftit.
I just know we will be together.	Naf biss li se nkunu flimkien.
And he was not alone.	U ma kienx waħdu.
I try not to think about it that way.	Nipprova ma naħsibx dwarha hekk.
He had friends there.	Kellu ħbieb hemmhekk.
You are not sure.	Inti mhux ċert.
It was so great.	Kien daqshekk kbir.
I just can’t do that.	Jien biss ma nistax nagħmel dan.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kinitx.
That’s good for me.	Dak hu tajjeb miegħi.
We don’t need help.	M'għandniex bżonn għajnuna.
I don’t know what’s in there.	Ma nafx x'hemm hemmhekk.
I have no idea how to do that.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif jagħmel dan.
That's what happened.	Dan ġara hekk.
He came out with us once.	Ħareġ magħna darba.
I can see everything.	Nista’ nara kollox.
They are here for you.	Huma hawn għalik.
I need more money.	Għandi bżonn aktar flus.
I can tell you what he's thinking.	Nista’ ngħid x’qed jaħseb.
I would be good for you.	Inkun tajjeb għalik.
He can leave.	Jista’ jitlaq.
I’m here when you want to talk.	Jien hawn meta trid titkellem.
It seemed to be going very well.	Deher li sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
She never did.	Hija qatt ma għamlet hekk.
No one said much.	Ħadd ma qal ħafna.
He had said more than he wanted.	Huwa kien qal aktar milli ried.
Wrong became good.	Ħażin sar tajjeb.
And obviously not.	U ovvjament mhux.
He could do something.	Seta’ jagħmel xi ħaġa.
The first one was easy.	L-ewwel kien faċli.
No, that wasn't going to work either.	Le, dan ma kienx se jaħdem lanqas.
You don’t go back to doing anything.	Inti ma tmur lura biex tagħmel xejn.
But it does the job.	Imma jagħmel ix-xogħol.
It all started pretty well.	Kollox beda pjuttost tajjeb.
But only one.	Imma wieħed biss.
I have never seen this.	Qatt ma rajt dan.
I knew they weren’t going to do the same thing every time.	Kont naf li mhux se jagħmlu l-istess ħaġa kull darba.
This is being done as well.	Dan qed isir ukoll.
She always had, until recently.	Dejjem kellha, sa ftit ilu.
Quick and easy !.	Malajr u faċli!.
Well, it's here.	Ukoll, huwa hawn.
This happens often.	Dan jiġri ta' spiss.
But no more than that from now on.	Imma mhux aktar minn hekk minn issa.
I know why.	Naf għaliex.
I never did.	Qatt ma għamilt jien.
Earlier than you think.	Aktar kmieni milli taħseb.
He should do it or do nothing.	Għandu jagħmel dan jew ma jagħmel xejn.
I'm really worried.	Jien tassew inkwetat.
Just a friend.	Ħabib biss.
I think.	Naħseb.
There is a lot of time !.	Hemm ħafna ħin!.
Obviously he is.	Ovvjament hu.
He couldn't see anything.	Ma setax jara xi ħaġa.
And if it weren’t.	U kieku ma kinitx .
Nothing was as it was.	Xejn ma kien kif kien.
But it is done.	Imma dan isir.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
It was happening again.	Kien qed jerġa’ jiġri.
I think maybe he needs to take some help.	Naħseb li forsi għandu bżonn jieħu xi għajnuna.
I believe not quite.	Nemmen pjuttost le.
That will have to do.	Dak ser ikollu jagħmel.
I know you're a good person.	Naf li int persuna tajba.
It just has to look good.	Għandu biss jidher tajjeb.
I'm not sure.	M'inix ċert.
It was better, much better.	Kien aħjar, ħafna aħjar.
I'm tired of that.	Jien għajjien minn hekk.
He can do anything.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel kollox.
He will go with you.	Hu se jmur miegħek.
He is ready to work.	Huwa lest biex jaħdem.
But only for a short time.	Imma għal ftit żmien biss.
It was doing.	Din kienet tagħmel.
I have no idea why he left.	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex telaq.
He died there.	Miet hemm.
But we can.	Imma nistgħu.
First I try.	L-ewwel nipprova.
No one outside knew anything about it.	Ħadd minn barra ma kien jaf xejn dwarha.
It didn’t look too good.	Ma deherx wisq tajjeb.
There was another problem, too.	Kien hemm problema oħra, ukoll.
This happened so quickly.	Dan ġara hekk malajr.
And it requires quite a bit of work.	U jeħtieġ pjuttost ftit xogħol.
I thought I wasn’t interested.	Ħsibt li ma kontx interessat.
We have everything and everything.	Għandna kollox u kollox.
This is actually quite easy.	Dan huwa fil-fatt pjuttost faċli.
You know where he is.	Taf fejn hu.
What is good is good, what is bad is bad.	Dak li hu tajjeb huwa tajjeb, dak li hu ħażin huwa ħażin.
Everything and everyone will come back.	Kollox u kulħadd se jiġi lura.
Well, there is nothing like it.	Ukoll, m'hemm xejn bħal dan.
I don’t see anything now.	Jien ma nara xejn issa.
Good with me.	Tajjeb miegħi.
I ask a man.	Nistaqsi raġel.
We will never be.	Qatt ma nkunu.
Well, that's it.	Ukoll, dak hu.
That's what happened.	Hekk ġara.
That's what he was waiting for.	Dak hu kien jistenna.
And she will.	U hi se.
We have help.	Għandna għajnuna.
Well, we did.	Ukoll, għamilna.
Who is there? 	Min hemm?
It's a lot of things.	Huwa ħafna affarijiet.
She did, hard.	Hija għamlet, diffiċli.
But he is not.	Imma hu mhux.
And he had.	U kellu.
I thought you knew.	Ħsibt li taf.
The.	Le.
I don’t have to and I shouldn’t be like that.	M'għandix għalfejn u m'għandix inkun hekk.
I knew it.	Jien kont naf li.
I think you want to do this a little bit.	Naħseb li trid tagħmel dan ftit.
We want to know more about it.	Irridu nkunu nafu aktar dwarha.
It’s not too small.	Mhuwiex żgħir wisq.
Everything is going wrong.	Kollox sejjer ħażin.
This is where he lives.	Dan huwa fejn jgħix.
This was not working.	Dan ma kienx qed jaħdem.
I want the first one.	Irrid l-ewwel wieħed.
You have a problem.	Għandek problema.
She wants to tell the truth.	Hija trid tgħid il-verità.
Don't be late!	Tkunx tard!
But it was great.	Imma kien kbir.
You're home now, boy.	Int id-dar issa, tifel.
One has to talk.	Wieħed irid jitkellem.
It wasn’t great, but it wasn’t bad.	Ma kienx kbir, imma ma kienx ħażin.
I'm not the same.	Jien mhux l-istess.
I have something to tell you.	Għandi xi ħaġa xi ngħidlek.
No, really, it can’t be.	Le, tassew, ma jistax ikun.
It's there but it's not.	Qiegħed hemm imma mhux.
That's what we're going to do.	Dak se nagħmlu.
I'm willing to do that.	Jien lest nagħmel hekk.
Come on, boy.	Ejja, tifel.
It was coming.	Kien jiġi.
She just needed to see.	Hija biss kellha bżonn tara.
But he wanted to talk about it.	Imma ried jitkellem dwarha.
I want to be here and now.	Irrid inkun hawn u issa.
No one can be better than you.	Ħadd ma jista’ jkun int aħjar milli tista’.
But there is no one there.	Imma m'hemm ħadd hemm.
He is a boy.	Huwa tifel.
I still can.	Għadni nista'.
No one knew anything.	Ħadd ma kien jaf xejn.
I didn’t want to do that.	Ma ridtx nagħmel dan.
I expect him to say something else, to do something else.	Nistenna li jgħid xi ħaġa oħra, li jagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
It's always late.	Huwa dejjem tard.
He did everything he did.	Għamel dak kollu li għamel kien hekk.
You may not be doing this.	Inti ma tistax tkun qed tagħmel dan.
I say why not.	Jien ngħid għaliex le.
He, of course, knew exactly where the problem was.	Huwa, ovvjament, kien jaf eżatt fejn kienet il-problema.
No one was seen.	Ħadd ma kien jidher.
And every year, it will never be me.	U kull sena, qatt mhu se nkun jien.
I didn't want to talk to anyone right now.	Ma ridt nitkellem ma’ ħadd bħalissa.
You can do the same thing here.	Tista 'tagħmel l-istess ħaġa hawn.
So much so.	Daqshekk.
Wrong.	Ħażin.
That, and that, and that too.	Dak, u dak, u dak ukoll.
I was thinking.	Kont qed naħseb.
Or he could have done something.	Jew seta’ jagħmel xi ħaġa.
He didn’t expect it to be that easy.	Ma kienx jistenna li jkun daqshekk faċli.
He came home.	Wasal id-dar.
Is that really what you wanted to say?	Huwa tassew dak li ridt tgħid?
Of all that they were.	Ta’ dak kollu li kienu.
You are not.	M'intix.
I was loving it.	Kont qed inħobb.
Not difficult, just done.	Mhux diffiċli, għadu kif sar.
She did just fine.	Hija għamlet biss tajjeb.
It can also be not so bad.	Jista 'jkun ukoll mhux daqshekk ħażin.
But not his last problems.	Imma mhux l-aħħar problemi tiegħu.
Everything was already occupied.	Kollox kien diġà okkupat.
In fact, he did.	Fil-fatt, huwa għamel.
And take what came for him.	U jieħu dak li ġie għalih.
I didn’t know when or how it would happen.	Ma kontx naf meta jew kif se jiġri.
I know what’s wrong with you.	Naf x'hemm ħażin miegħek.
I have been.	Jien ġejt.
That's not good.	Dak mhux tajjeb.
You are not big enough.	M'intix kbir biżżejjed.
And he never had, but.	U qatt ma kellu, imma.
It wasn't.	Ma kienx .
And he didn't know what to do.	U ma kienx jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
from.	minn.
I’m not telling anyone.	Jien ma ngħid lil ħadd.
I love it.	Qed inħobb.
But he never had.	Imma qatt ma kellu.
These were his.	Dawn kienu tiegħu.
I never thought much about it.	Qatt ma ħsibt ħafna dwarha.
It could be anyone.	Jista’ jkun xi ħadd.
You take every chance.	Inti tieħu kull ċans.
But it never looked good.	Imma qatt ma deher tajjeb.
It was always great.	Dejjem kien kbir.
Back there.	Lura hemm.
Not too much, maybe, but a little.	Mhux wisq, forsi, imma xi ftit.
They do do what they wanted to do.	Jagħmlu jagħmel dak li ried li jagħmel.
Maybe this helps.	Forsi dan jgħin.
She can be here.	Hija tista 'tkun hawn.
Can you see a friend here?	Tista' tara xi ħabib hawn?
Not so the first time.	Mhux hekk l-ewwel darba.
Or it won’t, and it may not live much longer.	Jew mhux se, u jista 'ma jgħix ħafna aktar.
He is still young.	Għadu żgħir.
Same thing with that.	L-istess ħaġa ma' dik.
Not doing a good job?	Ma tagħmilx xogħol tajjeb?
You know how she is.	Taf kif hi.
You know you can.	Taf li tista’.
This has been too long.	Dan ilu wisq.
I spent a lot of time outside.	Għamilt ħafna ħin barra.
No one does that.	M'hemm ħadd li jagħmel dan.
Maybe it took a little longer.	Forsi ta ftit aktar ħin.
It was bad enough that I saw it.	Kien ħażin biżżejjed li rajt.
Nothing is about.	Xejn huwa madwar.
I can't tell you when.	Ma nistax ngħidlek meta.
That can be a problem.	Dik tista 'tkun problema.
And yours.	U tiegħek.
Before she knew anything wrong.	Qabel ma kienet taf xi ħaġa ħażina.
It was easier now.	Kien aktar faċli issa.
We have a problem.	Għandna problema.
Maybe you.	Forsi int.
Maybe you can think of a little more.	Forsi tista 'taħseb ftit aktar.
She’s been here before and she just does it.	Hija kienet hawn qabel u hija biss tagħmel dan.
It was good to know that someone was on things.	Kien tajjeb li tkun taf li xi ħadd kien fuq l-affarijiet.
I want to go.	Irrid li tmur.
I’m not sure how to do that.	M'inix ċert kif nagħmel dan.
She looked beautiful.	Hija ħares sabiħa.
I never was.	Qatt ma kont.
Everyone was so friendly, too.	Kulħadd kien daqshekk faċli, ukoll.
I had to talk.	Kelli nitkellem.
I was happy to do so.	Kont kuntent li nagħmel hekk.
It wasn’t and never would be.	Ma kienx u qatt ma kien se jkun.
Not much.	Ma tantx.
So has everyone.	Hekk għandu kulħadd.
Not sure how everything works.	Mhux ċert kif jaħdem kollox.
He just came to me.	Huwa biss wasal lili.
But he is happy.	Imma hu kuntent.
He said he makes sure there are no problems.	Qal li jagħmel ċert li ma jkunx hemm problemi.
I knew it was going to happen.	Kont naf li kien se jiġri.
They are one and the same.	Huma wieħed u l-istess.
Just not us.	Biss mhux aħna.
I don’t know if this can work.	Ma nafx jekk dan jistax jaħdem.
.	.
It's being there.	Huwa li qiegħed hemmhekk.
I was alone all that time.	Jien kont waħdi dak il-ħin kollu.
He will not stand alone.	Hu mhux se joqgħod waħdu.
It’s time to go to school.	Wasal iż-żmien li tmur l-iskola.
Neither do I.	Lanqas lili.
I hope to be able to come home soon.	Nittama li jkun jista 'jiġi d-dar dalwaqt.
More than one person.	Aktar minn persuna waħda.
He says to say that he is not, but.	Jgħid li tgħid li mhux hu, imma.
It was ready.	Kien lest.
You don't do that.	Inti ma tagħmel dan.
I still can’t believe it.	Għadni ma nistax nemmen.
He will have to come back to this later.	Huwa jkollu jerġa 'lura għal dan aktar tard.
It's better that way.	Huwa aħjar hekk.
It’s me who wants it.	Huwa lili li jrid.
Yours and yours and yours.	Tiegħek u tiegħek u tiegħek.
I don’t know how to do that.	Ma nafx kif jagħmlu dan.
It's pretty easy to see why.	Huwa pjuttost faċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
One that needed to be seen.	Waħda li kellha bżonn tidher.
And he wasn’t going to talk about it.	U ma kienx se jitkellem dwarha.
Sure, there has to be a better way.	Żgur, għandu jkun hemm mod aħjar.
Let’s do what she says and let’s go.	Ejja nagħmlu dak li tgħid hi u mmorru.
What happened, happened.	Dak li ġara, ġara.
Things you only know and never see.	Affarijiet li taf biss u qatt ma tara.
He doesn't know who we are.	Ma jafx li aħna.
He didn't know.	Ma kienx jaf.
No, it looks like it did, but it wasn’t.	Le, qisu għamel, imma ma kienx.
It’s too much for one person.	Huwa wisq għal persuna waħda.
I just had to be here.	Kelli biss inkun hawn.
I am no more.	Jien m'iniex aktar.
In fact I had.	Fil-fatt kelli.
I'm the same.	Jien l-istess.
And nothing happened.	U ma ġara xejn.
Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow, ever.	Ħadd ma jaf x’se jiġri għada, qatt.
He was with a friend.	Kien ma’ ħabib.
I want to know what’s going on here.	Irrid inkun naf x'qed jiġri hawn.
I had to go back.	Kelli nerġa’ lura.
You have this.	Għandek dan.
I heard it's good.	Smajt li huwa tajjeb.
Everyone was fine, more or less.	Kulħadd kien tajjeb, xi ftit jew wisq.
Good after all.	Tajjeb wara kollox.
I really wanted to too.	Verament ridt ukoll.
This happens too often.	Dan jiġri ħafna drabi wisq.
I'm still there.	Għadni hemm.
The time to wait has never really come.	Iż-żmien li wieħed jistenna qatt ma wasal verament.
It should work.	Għandu jaħdem.
I want to know why.	Irrid inkun naf għaliex.
I have to say.	Ikolli ngħid.
He had one now.	Kellu wieħed issa.
There is no such thing.	M'hemm l-ebda ħaġa bħal din.
For me, it didn’t look good.	Għalija, ma deherx tajjeb.
This was something she had to do on her own.	Din kienet xi ħaġa li kellha tagħmel waħedha.
Everything else you do.	Kull ħaġa oħra tagħmel.
Maybe she was right.	Forsi kellha raġun.
Can you still eat?	Għadek tista' tiekol?
You want someone you like.	Trid lil xi ħadd li tixtieq.
Someone wants to.	Xi ħadd irid.
Are you sure about this ?.	Int ċert dwar dan?.
Still no one.	Għadu ħadd.
But he knew that so.	Imma kien jaf li hekk.
She needed nothing.	Ma kellha bżonn xejn.
It was good for me.	Kien tajjeb għalija.
I have nothing wrong to say about it.	M'għandi xejn ħażin xi ngħid dwarha.
It couldn't be.	Ma setax ikun.
And he seems to be right.	U jidher li għandu raġun.
When you think it was a bad idea.	Meta taħseb li kienet idea ħażina.
It’s harder than it looks, and it takes a lot of time.	Huwa aktar diffiċli milli jidher, u jieħu ħafna ħin.
I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.	M'inix ċert x'qed nagħmel ħażin.
Obviously there must be.	Ovvjament għandu jkun hemm.
He said he was still working on his book.	Qal li kien għadu jaħdem fuq il-ktieb tiegħu.
No child would say so.	L-ebda tifel ma kien jgħid hekk.
He wasn’t expecting it that way.	Ma kienx qed jistenna hekk.
Well, you don’t need my help.	Ukoll, m'għandekx bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħi.
You are more of a man than he is.	Int aktar raġel milli hu.
And it really works.	U tassew jaħdem.
I will be trying this again.	Ser inkun qed nipprova dan mill-ġdid.
But let me see.	Imma ħa nara.
There is nothing more.	M'hemm xejn aktar.
And you definitely should.	U żgur li għandek.
But he is not.	Imma hu mhux.
But maybe that's a good thing.	Imma forsi dik hija ħaġa tajba.
None of this is easy.	Xejn minn dawn mhu faċli.
I want what it actually is.	Irrid dak li fil-fatt hu.
she says.	hi tgħid.
It is something else.	Hija xi ħaġa oħra.
I'm going to talk to some people.	Jien ser nitkellem ma' xi nies.
How does this work? 	Kif jaħdem dan?
I'm a bit worried.	Jien daqsxejn inkwetat.
I could hear.	Stajt nisma.
That's right, completely.	Hekk hu, għal kollox.
But nothing happened.	Imma ma ġara xejn.
He has been here before.	Huwa kien hawn qabel.
I couldn't see who it was, but there was someone.	Ma stajtx nara min kien, imma kien hemm xi ħadd.
So it was, no more.	Hekk kien, mhux aktar.
You and he are not, yet.	Int u hu mhux, għadu.
Everyone knew this, of course.	Kulħadd kien jaf dan, ovvjament.
And he came to me.	U ġie għandi.
It looks really great.	Jidher tassew kbir.
And that's a problem.	U dik hija problema.
He said, it’s great.	Huwa qal, huwa kbir.
I really like that.	Nixtieq tassew hekk.
He did a great, great job.	Huwa għamel xogħol kbir, kbir.
So would that.	Hekk kieku li.
You can see it here, here, and here.	Tista 'tara hawn, hawn, u hawn.
I didn’t want it to be.	Jien ma ridtx li jkun.
There is one for you as well.	Hemm waħda għalik ukoll.
I had thought that one over.	I kellha ħsibt li wieħed fuq.
There was nothing like it.	Ma kien hemm xejn bħal dan.
That's what happened.	Hekk ġara.
And it still does.	U għadu jagħmel.
And so she had.	U hekk kellha hi.
She never does that.	Hija qatt ma tagħmel dan.
Sometimes this goes well, and sometimes it doesn’t.	Xi drabi dan imur tajjeb, u xi drabi le.
Only both.	It-tnejn biss.
He was doing things for me.	Kien jagħmel l-affarijiet għalija.
He looks very tired.	Jidher għajjien ħafna.
She had only one child.	Kellha tifel wieħed biss.
That's what it is.	Huwa dak li hu.
And ready to go.	U lest biex imur.
We are who we are.	Aħna min aħna.
It wasn't.	Ma kienx.
It won't be long.	Mhux se jkun twil.
Everyone happy.	Kulħadd kuntent.
He couldn’t just stand and watch it happen.	Ma setax biss joqgħod u jara dan jiġri.
It was really good.	Kien tassew tajjeb.
She is not good.	Hija mhix tajba.
Well, time only says.	Ukoll, iż-żmien biss jgħid.
Still, actually.	Għadu, fil-fatt.
That’s just about everyone.	Dak hu biss dwar kulħadd.
For me, but you know, not really.	Għalija, imma taf, mhux verament.
I don’t know who did it.	Ma nafx min għamel.
We have one here as well.	Għandna waħda hawn ukoll.
And the same problem appears.	U tidher l-istess problema.
It wasn't as it seemed, you know.	Ma kienx kif deher, taf.
This house is beautiful.	Din id-dar hija sabiħa.
But he was scared.	Imma kien jibża’.
There was something about it.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa dwarha.
It was going too far now.	Issa kien sejjer wisq.
I don’t want to wait.	Ma rridx nistenna.
She always had to.	Dejjem kellha.
You can't go wrong with this.	Ma tistax tmur ħażin b'dan.
To know more.	Biex tkun taf aktar.
He did so.	Hekk għamel.
It’s too late for me, now.	Huwa tard wisq għalija, issa.
It looked like it was nothing to him.	Għamel qisu ma kien xejn għalih.
But yours is.	Imma tiegħek hu.
They really do.	Huma verament jagħmlu.
I will say more.	Jien ngħid aktar.
It could have been there, of course.	Seta’ kien hemm, ovvjament.
It had happened.	Kien ġara.
I can't do it anymore.	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar.
As in, one.	Bħal fi, wieħed.
Which is wrong.	Li huwa ħażin.
If you are	Se int
You'll have a lot of fun.	Int ser tieħu gost tassew.
But it was something else.	Imma kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
More than that.	Aktar minn dan.
And no one came out looking too good.	U ħadd ma ħareġ jidher tajjeb wisq.
She knows everything.	Hija taf kollox.
That’s if you’re interested.	Dak jekk int interessat.
They are always there for me.	Huma dejjem hemm għalija.
It has been often.	Ġie spiss.
We were once friends.	Darba konna ħbieb.
He knew when he was right.	Kien jaf meta kellu tajjeb.
Not everyone has to do both.	Mhux kulħadd għandu jagħmel it-tnejn.
It will not be easy.	Mhux se jkun faċli.
That doesn’t make it any easier.	Dan ma jagħmilx aktar faċli.
It never was.	Qatt ma kien.
He was probably waiting for someone.	Probabbilment kien qed jistenna lil xi ħadd.
You can never be sure of what has just happened.	Qatt ma tista’ tkun pjuttost ċert minn dak li għadu kif għadda.
I didn't know I was out.	Ma kontx naf li kont barra.
That not everyone becomes great.	Li mhux kulħadd isir kbir.
And when he gets there, he does something.	U meta jasal hemm, jagħmel xi ħaġa.
Not someone who can see.	Mhux xi ħadd li jista’ jara.
She was just scared.	Hija kienet biss jibża.
Nor were they.	Lanqas ma kienu.
He is not here today.	Hu mhux hawn illum.
I haven’t seen anything yet.	Għadek ma rajt xejn.
And if so, it’s very little.	U jekk hekk, huwa ftit ħafna.
Maybe to everyone who was with him.	Forsi lil kull min kien miegħu.
It's good.	Huwa tajjeb.
More than enough.	Aktar minn biżżejjed.
Where were you?	Fejn kont?
That's right.	Hekk hu.
No one seemed sure.	Ħadd ma deher ċert.
And he may have lost.	U seta’ tilef.
And another, his.	U ieħor, tiegħu.
I didn’t know that.	Jien ma kontx naf li.
But that's what happens.	Imma huwa dak li jiġri.
It would be bad for both of us.	Ikun ħażin għalina t-tnejn.
Well, maybe not everything.	Ukoll, forsi mhux kollox.
Unemployed people.	Nies bla xogħol.
Quite something, really.	Pjuttost xi ħaġa, tassew.
But it really isn’t that hard.	Imma verament mhux daqshekk diffiċli.
It's not as easy as it sounds.	Mhuwiex faċli kif jidher.
Few have this.	Ftit għandhom dan.
There was no need.	Ma kienx hemm bżonn.
Or maybe that.	Jew forsi dan.
Not for you, but for you.	Mhux għalik, imma għalik.
This is happening too fast.	Dan qed jiġri malajr wisq.
I will eat tomorrow.	Jien niekol għada.
There is no way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod.
Maybe you should go with him?	Forsi għandek tmur miegħu?
Nobody really knows.	Ħadd ma jaf verament.
He seemed to be the first of many.	Deher li kien l-ewwel minn ħafna.
We did it before.	Għamilna qabel.
I wasn’t around for that.	Jien ma kontx madwar għal dak.
This is obviously a difficult one.	Din hija ovvjament waħda diffiċli.
He was talking to himself.	Kien qed jitkellem waħdu.
We know it can be difficult for some people to do.	Nafu li jista 'jkun diffiċli għal xi nies li jagħmlu.
I need to know.	Għandi bżonn inkun naf.
No, obviously not.	Le, ovvjament le.
The house is quite large.	Id-dar hija pjuttost kbira.
Every evening, they were back home.	Kull filgħaxija, kienu lura d-dar.
He couldn't say anything.	Ma seta’ jgħid xejn.
It could be you or me.	Hija tista 'tkun int jew jien.
We want these.	Irridu dawn.
Nothing was ever done.	Qatt ma sar xejn.
And so we did.	U hekk għamilna.
She was doing the same now.	Hija kienet tagħmel l-istess issa.
Not so much fun.	Mhux daqshekk gost.
Another thing.	Ħaġa oħra.
It would be hard work.	Ikun xogħol diffiċli.
He now lives alone.	Issa jgħix waħdu.
But you never know.	Imma qatt ma tkun taf.
It doesn't have to be that way.	M'għandux ikun hekk.
Nothing to make time for.	Xejn biex jagħmel il-ħin.
This is not one.	Din mhix waħda.
I really didn’t have to.	Verament ma kellix għalfejn.
But it could be otherwise.	Imma jista’ jkun mod ieħor.
But you don't.	Imma inti ma.
This is what it looks like.	Dan huwa dak li jidher.
A child might say.	Tifel jista 'jgħid.
I think you can do whatever you want.	Naħseb li tista 'tagħmel dak kollu li trid.
I thought you should know.	Ħsibt li għandek tkun taf.
He needed more time.	Huwa kellu bżonn aktar ħin.
This is a difficult year for many people.	Din hija sena diffiċli għal ħafna nies.
He wasn't sure who did it.	Ma kienx ċert min għamel dan.
But there were no people.	Imma ma kienx hemm nies.
There he sat down.	Hemmhekk poġġa bilqiegħda.
I wanted to do something great.	Ridt nagħmel xi ħaġa kbira.
You don’t need to be here.	M'għandekx bżonn tkun hawn.
I hope you can see this.	Nispera li tista' tara dan.
There will never be time.	Qatt ma jkun hemm ħin.
It's a beautiful car.	Hija karozza sabiħa.
To do these things.	Biex tagħmel dawn l-affarijiet.
How are you.	Kif inti.
It seems too easy.	Jidher faċli wisq.
It's been too long.	Kien ilu wisq.
This is what it happens to be.	Dan huwa dak li jiġri li jkun.
I would probably say no.	Probabbilment ngħid le.
I don't have these.	M'għandix dawn.
But no one knows this until it actually happens.	Imma ħadd ma jaf dan sakemm fil-fatt jiġri.
It's really easy !.	Huwa tassew faċli!.
Good to know.	Tajjeb li tkun taf.
It could be anything.	Jista 'jkun xi ħaġa.
I'll be out.	Jien ser inkun barra.
Just for you.	Għalik biss.
He really couldn't.	Huwa tassew ma setax.
Not us, not them.	Mhux aħna, mhux huma.
I don’t need to sit down.	M'għandix bżonn noqgħod bilqiegħda.
I was too tired to eat.	Kont għajjien wisq biex niekol.
But that was not what happened.	Imma dan ma kienx dak li ġara.
His friend was there.	Ħabib tiegħu kien hemm.
I'm telling you now.	Jien ngħidlek issa.
So we did.	Hekk għamilna.
Please more, more.	Jekk jogħġbok aktar, aktar.
It wasn’t, of course.	Ma kienx, ovvjament.
The work was done quickly.	Ix-xogħol sar malajr.
I used to do that too.	Jien kont nagħmel hekk ukoll.
It had to be.	Kellu jkun.
That's us.	Dak aħna.
He wasn't sure.	Ma kienx ċert.
But not about that.	Imma mhux dwar dan.
No one went on.	Ħadd ma mar fuq.
I wanted to do something that doesn’t.	Ridt nagħmel xi ħaġa li ma tagħmilx hekk.
It couldn't have been easier.	Ma setax kien faċli.
Let's do that.	Ejja nagħmlu hekk.
And how much.	U kemm.
It must be mine.	Għandu jkun tiegħi.
Same thing really.	L-istess ħaġa tassew.
But that doesn’t hurt.	Imma dan ma jagħmilx ħażin.
You have to know something.	Għandek tkun taf xi ħaġa.
You and she are not the first.	Int u hi mhux l-ewwel.
He was expecting this.	Huwa kien jistenna dan.
I was alone.	Jien kont waħdi.
I was very happy at home.	Kont kuntent ħafna d-dar.
I never had that.	Qatt ma kelli dak.
It works every time.	Jaħdem kull darba.
This cannot happen!	Dan ma jistax jiġri!
Many things.	Ħafna affarijiet.
That was why we were tired.	Dan kien għaliex konna għajjien.
It wouldn’t have been that hard.	Ma kienx ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
And he should know.	U għandu jkun jaf.
Not just the first.	Mhux l-ewwel biss.
But she needed time to think.	Imma kellha bżonn iż-żmien biex taħseb.
It's very bad.	Huwa ħażin ħafna.
Back to a time like this.	Lura għal żmien bħal dan.
I had never done so before.	Qatt ma kont għamilt hekk qabel.
He said that when he got there he would know.	Qal li meta jasal hemm kien ikun jaf.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Mhux l-ewwel darba li ġara dan.
He told me he didn’t know.	Huwa qalli li ma kienx jaf.
We have a good time.	Għandna żmien tajjeb.
I knew you wanted time with him.	Kont naf li trid ħin miegħu.
So they are.	Hekk huma.
Don't say anything.	Ma tgħid xejn.
Why are they doing this?	Għaliex qed jagħmlu dan?
Big and small.	Kbir u żgħir.
I'm just a kid.	Jien biss tifel.
But he doesn’t.	Imma hu ma jagħmilx hekk.
I had never been there before.	Qatt ma kont hemm qabel.
I do the same for you.	Jien nagħmel l-istess għalik.
No one is sure what will happen next.	Ħadd mhu ċert x’se jiġi wara.
He will be fine.	Hu se jkun tajjeb.
There were no problems.	Ma kienx hemm problemi.
I used to do that.	Jien kont nagħmel hekk.
He was a boy.	Kien tifel.
I don't want to know anything.	Ma rrid inkun naf xejn.
Besides, he was right.	Barra minn hekk, kellu raġun.
It will happen again.	Huwa ser jerġa 'jiġri.
This is what you want too.	Dan huwa dak li trid int ukoll.
Just do you.	Biss tagħmel inti.
It's as bad as it gets.	Huwa ħażin kemm jista 'jkun.
I know this is good.	Naf li dan huwa tajjeb.
You do all the work.	Int tagħmel ix-xogħol kollu.
And he wouldn’t have for a long time.	U ma kienx ikollu għal żmien twil.
It didn't look good.	Ma kienx jidher tajjeb.
I didn’t have time to even think about it.	Ma kellix ħin biex lanqas naħseb.
I really like that he was happy.	Verament inħobb li kien kuntent.
A year ago, it wouldn’t have been.	Sena ilu, ma kienx ikun.
But nothing is forever, either.	Imma xejn mhu għal dejjem, lanqas.
I need to understand more.	Għandi bżonn li nifhem aktar.
I'm fine with that.	Jien tajjeb ma 'dan.
It's just more accurate.	Huwa biss aktar eżatt.
He was the one who wants to be behind everything else.	Kien min irid ikun wara kull ħaġa oħra.
But nothing was exactly right.	Imma xejn ma kien tajjeb eżatt.
I don’t have that much time.	M'għandix daqshekk ħin.
I know there are many.	Naf li hemm ħafna.
No, not good.	Le, mhux tajjeb.
Not very big.	Mhix kbira ħafna.
This and we do more we do not have.	Dan u nagħmlu aktar m'għandniex.
It shouldn’t happen.	M'għandux jiġri.
It was almost too late.	Kienu kważi tard wisq.
That was for me.	Dak kien għalija.
It had been done so well.	Kien sar hekk tajjeb.
And that’s something.	U dik hija xi ħaġa.
This may or may not happen.	Dan jista 'jew ma jistax jiġri.
This should not be happening.	Dan m'għandux ikun qed jiġri.
Maybe there never really was.	Forsi qatt ma kien hemm verament.
That would be wrong.	Li kien ikun ħażin.
He had no idea how much time had passed.	Ma kellux idea kemm kien għadda żmien.
That would come back, he thought.	Dan kien se jerġa’ lura, ħaseb.
It’s not hard to see why this should be so.	Mhux diffiċli li wieħed jara għaliex dan għandu jkun hekk.
We cannot do that.	Ma nistgħux nagħmlu dan.
I was worried.	Kont inkwetat.
Now, you’re like any other man.	Issa, int bħal kull raġel ieħor.
The school did not know what to do with it.	L-iskola ma kinitx taf x'se tagħmel miegħu.
But this is not.	Imma dan mhux.
But he was gone.	Imma kien telaq.
No one should have really been surprised.	Ħadd ma kellu verament ikun sorpriż.
From time to time, it will come to me.	Minn żmien sa, se tiġi għandi.
It must be coming sooner or later.	Għandu jkun ġej illum jew għada.
I do that.	Jien nagħmel dan.
He did something and left.	Għamel xi ħaġa u telaq.
Not a little bit.	Mhux ftit ftit.
I was both.	Kont it-tnejn.
I think she is very beautiful.	Naħseb li hija sabiħa ħafna.
Everything is working fine.	Kollox qed jaħdem tajjeb.
That must be difficult.	Dak irid ikun diffiċli.
I say this here and now.	Jien ngħid dan hawn u issa.
I may be doing this now.	Jista’ jkun li nkun qed nagħmel hekk issa.
You have everything you need.	Għandek dak kollu li għandek bżonn.
I want this done.	Irrid li dan isir.
But this we are.	Imma dan aħna.
That’s really it.	Dak hu tassew.
He’s just a great man.	Huwa biss raġel kbir.
It wasn’t a good bit.	Ma kienx daqsxejn tajjeb.
Everything seemed fun.	Kollox deher gost.
No more talking.	Mhux aktar jitkellem.
I was not afraid.	Ma kontx nibża’.
That's for sure.	Dak żgur.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
I’ve been there for a long time.	Jien kont ilni.
I know it’s something.	Naf li hija xi ħaġa.
Do you have the time?	Għandek il-ħin?
My friend told me about it a few years ago.	Ħabib tiegħi qalli dwarha ftit snin ilu.
You saw that.	Inti rajt li.
I think we had.	Naħseb li kellna.
But this will never happen.	Imma dan qatt mhu se jiġri.
You have to do this for hours and hours.	Trid trid tagħmel dan għal sigħat u sigħat.
We just.	Aħna biss.
But there was no time.	Imma ma kienx hemm ħin.
It wasn’t too much.	Ma kienx wisq.
I can't buy this.	Ma nistax nixtri dan.
It has to be just one thing.	Trid tkun ħaġa waħda biss.
Maybe, never.	Forsi, mhux qatt.
The truth is.	Il-verità hi.
I said.	Jien għidt.
Not the truth.	Mhux il-verità.
He wanted that.	Ried li.
Nobody knows how much.	Ħadd ma jaf kemm.
I must have seen one or both before.	I għandu rajt wieħed jew it-tnejn qabel.
Now she didn’t know what to think.	Issa ma kinitx taf x'se taħseb.
Something was wrong.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
He still doesn't.	Huwa għadu ma.
I can’t understand how he got here.	Ma nistax nifhem kif wasal hawn.
I can't do that.	Jien ma nistax nagħmel dan.
What happened to me happened a long time ago.	Dak li ġara lili ġara żmien twil ilu.
I won't tell you again.	Mhux se nerġa’ ngħidlek.
But no one wanted to go.	Imma ħadd ma ried imur.
He took you, like everyone else.	Huwa ħa inti, bħal kulħadd.
You will not go wrong.	Inti mhux se tmur ħażin.
This is actually wrong.	Dan huwa fil-fatt ħażin.
It's just, we have no idea how.	Huwa biss, m'għandniex idea kif.
These are who they always have been.	Dawn huma li dejjem kienu.
That’s what you see.	Dak hu li tara.
I don't think so.	ma naħsibx.
I have everything here.	Għandi kollox hawn.
That felt good.	Li ħassu tajjeb.
I have to say.	Għandi ngħid.
Maybe more than a little.	Forsi aktar minn ftit.
He won't have to.	Hu mhux se jkollu.
And if you want to be.	U jekk trid tkun.
I'm not sure that's mine.	Ma nafx ċert li tiegħi.
This is, in fact, what happened.	Dan huwa, fil-fatt, dak li ġara.
Until she.	Sakemm hi.
But if you could.	Imma kieku tista'.
All the time, 'he said.	Il-ħin kollu,’ qal.
It can go wrong, of course.	Jista 'jmur ħażin, ovvjament.
Apparently, she hadn’t done a very good job.	Milli jidher, hija ma kinitx għamlet xogħol tajjeb ħafna.
He felt more and more at home.	Huwa ħassu dejjem aktar id-dar.
It's what you want.	Huwa dak li trid.
Not too much, but a little.	Mhux wisq, imma ftit.
If this is what you want, great.	Jekk dan huwa trid li ridt, kbir.
He was right to be afraid.	Kellu raġun li jibża’.
They are yours.	Huma tiegħek.
It will be a while.	Se jkun ftit żmien.
But it wasn’t like that, it was, it wasn’t like that.	Imma ma kienx hekk, kien, ma kienx hekk.
It was back to him.	Kien lura għalih.
I'm sorry.	Jiddispjaċini.
You're ready.	Int lest.
But he did nothing.	Imma ma għamel xejn.
We only do the things we can do.	Aħna nagħmlu l-affarijiet li nistgħu nagħmlu biss.
I just need to talk to you.	Għandi bżonn biss nitkellem miegħek.
This works well.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb.
He wanted to leave.	Ried jitlaq.
He went back and left.	Huwa mar lura u telaq.
Maybe there is nothing.	Forsi m'hemm xejn.
I hope you know that too.	Nistenna li int taf hekk ukoll.
No, it was more than beautiful.	Le, kienet aktar minn sabiħa.
It always is.	Hija dejjem.
I did a lot.	Għamilt ħafna.
But you don’t have to if you don’t want to.	Imma m'għandekx għalfejn jekk ma tridx.
It was almost noon.	Kien kważi nofsinhar.
And this you see.	U dan tara.
He was tired, for one thing.	Kien għajjien, għal ħaġa waħda.
That's all you need to know.	Dak kemm trid tkun taf.
So great.	Hekk hu kbir.
Look at it.	Ħares lejn huwa.
You have to go.	Għandek tmur.
I'm afraid of what might happen.	Jien nibża’ minn dak li jista’ jiġi.
I’m getting better now, just tired.	Jien sejjer aħjar issa, biss għajjien.
I think it could be something else.	Naħseb li tista' tkun xi ħaġa oħra.
I don't have time.	M'għandix ħin.
Everyone there thought it was a good idea.	Kulħadd hemm ħaseb li kienet idea tajba.
It had to happen.	Kellu jiġri.
You will stay here.	Int se toqgħod hawn.
There really is something for everyone.	Hemm verament xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
I know he has one.	Naf li għandu wieħed.
This was not going to be easy.	Dan ma kienx se jkun faċli.
I know it’s hard.	Naf li huwa diffiċli.
It was.	Kien.
No one can do that.	Ħadd ma jista’ jagħmel dan.
It’s easy to see why this happened.	Huwa faċli li wieħed jara għaliex dan ġara.
But we can only do this if we know how.	Imma nistgħu nagħmlu dan biss jekk nafu.
Well, it was.	Ukoll, kien hekk.
I saw a man sitting there.	Rajt raġel bilqiegħda hemm.
It wasn't really as easy as you might think.	Ma kienx verament daqshekk faċli kif wieħed jaħseb.
This looked good.	Dan deher tajjeb.
More than that he says.	Aktar minn hekk jgħid.
We had.	Kellna.
Maybe it was both.	Forsi kien it-tnejn.
Good thing here.	Ħaġa tajba hawn.
We will be back tonight.	Se nkunu lura illejla.
But that's it.	Imma dak hu.
Quite a while, it seems.	Pjuttost żmien, jidher.
But no one is there.	Imma ħadd hemm.
He wanted to work harder.	Ried jaħdem aktar.
As far as I know.	Sa fejn naf jien.
I’m the only one here.	Jien l-uniku wieħed hawn.
But it doesn’t seem to work.	Imma ma jidhirx li jaħdem.
You will stand for everyone.	Inti ser toqgħod għal kulħadd.
I'm a little tired.	Jien xi ftit għajjien.
I hope you do, too.	Nispera li inti, ukoll.
You must have heard.	Int trid smajt.
Come on !.	Ejja!.
And me.	U jien.
Or better yet.	Jew aħjar toqgħod.
It was now.	Kien issa.
He will see to it.	Huwa ser jara li dan.
But not enough.	Imma mhux biżżejjed.
But we only have another year.	Imma għandna biss sena oħra.
But the first one more.	Imma l-ewwel wieħed aktar.
And so it was with this.	U hekk kien ma 'dan.
I can’t say if this is so.	Ma nistax ngħid jekk dan hux hekk.
They are quick, easy and fun as well.	Huma ta 'malajr, faċli u ta' gost ukoll.
I can't do that.	Ma nistax nagħmel hekk.
He may not like it that way.	Jista’ ma jħobbx hekk.
Or he should have known.	Jew kellu jkun jaf.
I need more money.	Għandi bżonn aktar flus.
It is very difficult above.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna hawn fuq.
We are, really.	Aħna, tassew.
I'm again.	Jien mill-ġdid.
Come on people.	Ejja nies.
She didn't know many things.	Ma kinitx taf ħafna affarijiet.
I’m back at work.	Jien lura fuq ix-xogħol tiegħi.
It seemed too much.	Deher wisq.
Better not, better not.	Aħjar le, aħjar le.
I can't tell anyone.	Ma nista’ ngħid lil ħadd.
Well, it's not.	Ukoll, mhuwiex.
But a few things.	Imma ftit affarijiet.
They will do whatever it takes.	Huma ser jagħmlu dak kollu li hemm bżonn.
He can, or he can't.	Jista’, jew ma jistax.
There was nothing more to say.	Ma kienx hemm aktar xi ngħid.
That's a lot.	Dak daqsxejn ħafna.
The first is a man.	L-ewwel huwa raġel.
It's not as difficult as it sounds.	Mhuwiex diffiċli daqs kemm jidher.
I can't do it anymore.	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar.
That's good.	Dak tajjeb.
The door went back to his door.	Il-bieb mar lura lejn il-bieb tiegħu.
Obviously something was wrong with him.	Ovvjament xi ħaġa kienet ħażina miegħu.
How can this happen?	Kif jista’ jiġri dan.
He wouldn’t be the same, either.	Hu ma jkunx l-istess, lanqas.
Nothing great at all.	Xejn kbir xejn.
That was another thing.	Dik kienet ħaġa oħra.
There were so few.	Kien hemm daqshekk ftit.
There are no sure things.	M'hemm l-ebda affarijiet żgur.
What will that.	X'se dak.
And it's great.	U huwa kbir.
It was his.	Kien tiegħu.
You can't do that anymore.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan aktar.
This all works very well.	Dan kollu jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
He wants to have fun.	Irid jieħu gost.
You have it.	Għandek dan.
I’m thinking here.	Qed naħseb hawn.
I wasn't even sure what to say.	Lanqas kont ċert x’se ngħid.
I go alone.	Jien immur waħdi.
I have no problem with that.	M'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan.
And they are.	U huma.
He is who we are.	Huwa min aħna.
Just a little more.	Biss ftit aktar.
A better one, too.	Wieħed aħjar, ukoll.
If he did, he would come back.	Kieku kien, jerġa’ lura.
You never think that but so.	Qatt ma taħseb li imma hekk.
I always do.	Jien dejjem .
In fact, it can’t be.	Fil-fatt, ma jistax ikun.
You think it’s going to be a big deal.	Taħseb li se tkun xi ħaġa kbira.
But so it has been lately.	Imma hekk ġara dan l-aħħar.
I've just died.	I stajt biss miet.
He is right.	Huwa għandu raġun.
Everyone knows everything.	Kulħadd jaf kollox.
She knew that door.	Kienet taf dak il-bieb.
I never thought I was capable of this.	Qatt ma ħsibt li kienet kapaċi għal dan.
He never left.	Hu qatt ma telaq.
He just couldn't.	Huwa biss ma setax.
He actually said that.	Huwa fil-fatt qal li.
It's good.	Hija tajba.
No time for anything, now.	L-ebda ħin għal xejn, issa.
I am glad to be with you.	Jien ferħan li nkun miegħek.
We had just too much time.	Kellna ftit wisq ħin.
Just take you.	Biss tieħu inti.
More than anything.	Aktar minn kull ħaġa.
I didn't go with anyone.	Jien ma mort ma’ ħadd.
I’m glad for these things.	Jien ferħan għal dawn l-affarijiet.
It should not be long.	M'għandux ikun twil.
But now it’s too late to go back.	Imma issa huwa tard wisq biex tmur lura.
He was a big boy.	Kien tifel kbir.
It is as follows.	Huwa kif ġej.
And they are right.	U għandhom raġun.
There was no one in the room.	Ma kien hemm ħadd fil-kamra.
It never worked.	Qatt ma kien jaħdem.
I didn’t want to be one.	Ma kontx ridt inkun wieħed.
I think you have a problem.	Naħseb li għandek problema.
It never was, it never will be.	Qatt ma kien, qatt mhu se jkun.
Not difficult either.	Mhux diffiċli lanqas.
That was the last thing he said.	Dik kienet l-aħħar ħaġa li qal.
Me and you.	Lili u int.
I don’t know why this should be so.	Ma nafx għaliex dan għandu jkun hekk.
I have it all.	Għandi dak kollu.
It's nothing more.	Hu xejn aktar.
This is where we are today.	Dan huwa fejn aħna llum.
I still can’t believe it.	Għadu ma nistax nemmen.
There wasn’t much out there.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna hemmhekk.
And without it.	U mingħajr dan.
I don’t want this to be just another.	Ma rridx li dan ikun biss ieħor.
The car was still there.	Il-karozza kienet għadha hemm.
The only person he knew.	L-unika persuna li kien jaf.
You're a man.	Int raġel.
It's a problem.	Hija problema.
We will never know for sure, now.	Qatt mhu se nkunu nafu żgur, issa.
That was a problem.	Din kienet problema.
And this house.	U din id-dar.
I already understand what I said.	Diġà nifhem dak li għedt.
Sorry for you.	Jiddispjaċini għalik.
To go to work.	Biex tmur ix-xogħol.
And you should be too.	U għandek tkun ukoll.
He was busy.	Huwa kien okkupat.
And not good.	U mhux tajjeb.
He won’t talk about it.	Mhux se jitkellem dwarha.
I have to think about that.	Ikolli naħseb dwar dik.
I think this should work much faster.	Naħseb li dan għandu jaħdem ħafna aktar malajr.
I know too many things.	Naf wisq affarijiet.
I didn’t think so.	Ma kontx ħsibt.
I will definitely try this soon.	Żgur li dalwaqt nipprova dan.
It had to be something.	Kellu jkun xi ħaġa.
They quickly do.	Huma malajr jagħmlu.
They are not alone.	Mhux huma biss.
It's for him.	Huwa għalih.
I thought you wanted to know.	Ħsibt li trid tkun taf.
No one is eating now.	Ħadd mhu qed jiekol issa.
Just big enough for me.	Biss kbir biżżejjed għalija.
There is usually not much out there.	Normalment ma jkunx hemm ħafna hemmhekk.
How about that.	Kif dwar dan.
I have no idea why.	M'għandix idea għaliex.
He thought things through.	Huwa ħaseb l-affarijiet.
You want to do better.	Int trid tagħmel aħjar.
Now she knew this was not going to happen.	Issa kienet taf li dan mhux se jiġri.
Well, let’s go.	Ukoll, ejja mmorru.
It takes longer than you think.	Huwa jieħu aktar milli suppost taħseb.
I can’t really talk now.	Ma nistax verament nitkellem issa.
This is pretty much for this week.	Dan huwa pjuttost għal din il-ġimgħa.
There is nothing for you here.	M'hemm xejn għalik hawn.
Maybe a little here and there.	Forsi ftit hawn u hemm.
The problem is you.	Il-problema int.
I wasn’t too happy.	Jien ma kont kuntent wisq.
He knew what was going on and did nothing.	Kien jaf x’qed jiġri u ma għamel xejn.
I knew it was there.	Kont naf li kien hemm.
I knew he wasn’t going to come back.	Kont naf li ma kienx se jiġi lura.
She says something.	Hi tgħid xi ħaġa.
And after we were a year together, it happened.	U wara li konna sena flimkien, ġara.
Nobody really knows.	Ħadd ma jaf verament.
But he has something of mine.	Imma għandu xi ħaġa tiegħi.
It is very easy to do.	Huwa faċli ħafna li tagħmel.
It's just something.	Huwa biss xi ħaġa.
You did that.	Int li għamilt hekk.
That's all there is to it.	Dak kollu hemm.
He had never seen one before.	Hu qatt ma kien ra wieħed qabel.
We want to know who we really are.	Irridu nkunu nafu min aħna tassew.
I had mine.	Kelli tiegħi.
I am very happy to be here.	Jien kuntent ħafna li nkun hawn.
He is watching.	Qed jara.
He knew something.	Kien jaf xi ħaġa.
Everyone seems to be talking about that time.	Kulħadd jidher li qed jitkellem dwar dak iż-żmien.
I know this is not going to happen.	Naf li dan mhux se jiġri.
One said it was too small.	Wieħed qal li kien żgħir wisq.
I had to do it on my own.	Kelli nagħmel hekk fuq tiegħi.
I can't tell anyone.	Ma nista’ ngħid lil ħadd.
He asked to have me on.	Huwa talab li jkollu lili fuq.
Now you will be.	Issa inti tkun.
No, not for us.	Le, mhux għalina.
And that is enough.	U dan huwa biżżejjed.
No more than one.	Mhux aktar minn wieħed.
I can say that.	Nista’ ngħid hekk.
But it must.	Imma għandu.
What he needed.	Dak li kellu bżonn.
Which is so bad bad.	Li tant hu ħażin ħażin.
I believe he had.	Nemmen li kellu.
I'm happy.	Jien kuntent.
It is a difficult thing.	Hija ħaġa diffiċli.
I am very happy.	Jiena kuntent ħafna.
I would like to come earlier.	Nixtieq li tiġi qabel.
This is a problem.	Din hija problema.
And you know where it comes from.	U taf minn fejn ġej.
We will be back as soon as possible.	Se nkunu lura kemm jista' jkun malajr.
Too many years.	Wisq snin.
I like it more.	Inħobb aktar.
Well no more.	Ukoll mhux aktar.
More and more, year after year, little by little.	Aktar u aktar, sena wara sena, ftit ftit.
Well, as I said.	Ukoll, kif għedt.
But so it was.	Imma hekk kien.
It seemed like he wanted to be me, but better.	Deher li ried ikun jien, imma aħjar.
It looks good to me.	Jidher tajjeb għalija.
I just wanted to know what was going on.	Ridt biss inkun naf x’qed jiġri.
I hope to make sure again.	Nittama li nerġa' nagħmel żgur.
Or not enough.	Jew mhux biżżejjed.
Sometimes, not so bad.	Xi drabi, mhux daqshekk ħażin.
There is something to that.	Hemm xi ħaġa għal dak.
I’m not saying you are, of course.	Mhux qed ngħid li int, ovvjament.
Well, it's ready.	Ukoll, huwa lest.
We have to do this.	Irridu nagħmlu dan.
I put up quickly.	I poġġa malajr.
But no, it's not.	Imma le, mhux hu.
I would be good for you.	Inkun tajjeb għalik.
As he was.	Kif kien hu.
He was doing a lot.	Kien qed jagħmel ħafna.
It would be.	Ikun.
And no, not at all.	U le, lanqas hekk.
And that was what she needed now.	U dan kien dak li kellha bżonn issa.
And alone.	U waħdu.
He wasn't sure why.	Ma kienx ċert għaliex.
Or he didn’t want to say.	Jew ma riedx tgħid.
He will be back soon.	Huwa se jkun lura dalwaqt.
It never was.	Qatt ma kien.
Well, one did.	Ukoll, wieħed għamel.
I want to do something, be someone.	Irrid nagħmel xi ħaġa, inkun xi ħadd.
I don’t really have a chance.	Jien ma tantx għandi ċans.
But not now.	Imma mhux issa.
We did nothing wrong.	Aħna ma għamilna xejn ħażin.
Not at all.	Lanqas b’dan.
This could have happened to me.	Dan seta’ ġara lili.
I don’t even have to say anything else.	Lanqas għandi għalfejn ngħid xi ħaġa oħra.
Better and better.	Aħjar u aħjar.
More, more, he said.	Aktar, aktar, qal.
Maybe so.	Forsi huwa hekk.
It has been so for over a year.	Ilu hekk għal aktar minn sena.
But that was the first.	Imma dik kienet l-ewwel.
It could have been there.	Seta’ kien hemm.
If this happens once, it may happen again.	Jekk dan ġara darba, forsi jista’ jerġa’ jiġri.
Or leave again.	Jew jerġa 'jitlaq.
There is nothing else to hope for.	M'hemm xejn ieħor xi jittama.
You must be tired.	Trid tkun għajjien.
Everyone was pretty friendly.	Kulħadd kien pjuttost faċli.
But you can do things about it.	Imma tista 'tagħmel affarijiet dwar dan.
Now, she did.	Issa, hija għamlet.
There was a lot out there.	Kien hemm ħafna hemmhekk.
It could be something more.	Tista 'tkun xi ħaġa aktar.
He looked at.	Huwa ħares lejn.
And nothing good ever comes of it.	U xejn tajjeb qatt ġej minn hekk.
Not that he needed to.	Mhux li kellu bżonn.
We may never know.	Forsi qatt ma nkunu nafu.
Very good !.	Tajjeb ħafna!.
But no.	Imma le.
It made a lot of people.	Għamel ħafna nies.
I had done the same.	Jien kont għamilt l-istess.
Well, there is.	Ukoll, hemm.
He took it all in.	Huwa ħa dan kollu.
It usually works.	Normalment jaħdem.
And we are so.	U aħna hekk.
She had a lot of money now.	Issa kellha ħafna flus.
It was the same thing.	Kienet l-istess ħaġa.
That's really great.	Dak tassew kbir.
Not sure where it's going wrong.	Mhux ċert fejn sejjer ħażin.
I knew the truth.	Kont naf il-verità.
No one ever did.	Ħadd qatt ma għamel.
I hope he is right.	Nispera li għandu raġun.
He is tired.	Huwa għajjien.
I believed that.	Jien kont nemmen li.
It always will and always will.	Dejjem se u dejjem ikollu.
Maybe something will happen.	Forsi jiġri xi ħaġa.
Not just for me.	Mhux għalija biss.
And now this.	U issa dan.
But no one knew what to do.	Imma ħadd ma kien jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
I know he can.	Naf li jista’.
I knew it would be so.	Kont naf li se jkun hekk.
From now on I will do things from here.	Minn issa se nagħmel l-affarijiet minn hawn.
But he’s not really interested.	Imma hu mhux verament interessat.
You have to make one.	Għandek tagħmel waħda.
We have to do better than that.	Irridu nagħmlu aħjar minn dan.
Why do you want to know?	Għaliex trid tkun taf?
I'm sure it will be fine.	Jien ċert li se jkun tajjeb.
I don’t know either.	Jien ma nafx lanqas.
It would have been good.	Kieku kienet tajba.
But he wasn’t saying anything about it.	Imma ma kien qed jgħid xejn dwarha.
They just looked at the time.	Huma biss ħares lejn il-ħin.
So we did.	Hekk għamilna.
No one can be sure.	Ħadd ma jista’ jkun ċert.
I didn’t want to.	Ma ridtx.
But it doesn’t seem to be working.	Imma ma jidhirx li qed jaħdem.
We had a good time.	Kellna żmien tajjeb.
And he still didn’t want to go back.	U għadu ma riedx imur lura.
To do this.	Biex dan isir.
He did none of this.	Huwa ma għamel xejn minn dan.
I’m never too tired.	Jien qatt ma għajjien wisq.
Who wasn't ?.	Min ma kienx?.
We will be back tomorrow.	Se nkunu lura għada.
I know not much.	Naf li mhux ħafna.
He must be my very good friend.	Huwa għandu jkun ħabib tajjeb ħafna tiegħi.
There was no one.	Ma kien hemm ħadd.
I didn’t know better.	Ma kontx naf aħjar.
You never go home.	Int qatt ma tmur id-dar.
I have a good job.	Għandi xogħol tajjeb.
And this we need to know.	U dan irridu nkunu nafu.
But that did not happen.	Imma mhux hekk ġara.
Probably not good.	Probabbilment mhux tajjeb.
Something good comes from all bad.	Xi ħaġa tajba tiġi minn kull ħażin.
Where to go and do well.	Fejn tmur u tagħmel tajjeb.
It couldn’t be easier.	Ma jistax ikun aktar faċli.
The above works well.	Dan ta 'hawn fuq jaħdem tajjeb.
It’s what he says he is.	Huwa dak li jgħid li hu.
That was almost a year ago.	Dak kien kważi sena ilu.
Last night was the first one.	Ilbieraħ filgħaxija kienet l-ewwel waħda.
Bad idea.	Idea ħażina.
This is not, of course, what happened.	Dan mhux, ovvjament, dak li ġara.
Maybe it’s not such a good idea now that you’re thinking about it.	Forsi mhux idea daqshekk tajba issa qed taħseb dwarha.
Not as bad as it could be.	Mhux ħażin daqskemm seta’ jkun.
But this is not working.	Imma dan mhux qed jaħdem.
But that’s not what happened last time.	Imma dan mhux dak li ġara l-aħħar darba.
I was happy to do that.	Kont kuntent li nagħmel hekk.
I'm not afraid of anything.	Jien ma nibża’ minn xejn.
It's happening, right now.	Qed jiġri, bħalissa.
I want to know that it will be good.	Irrid inkun naf li se jkun tajjeb.
There was no time.	Ma kienx hemm ħin.
And another, and another.	U ieħor, u ieħor.
He is a good man.	Huwa raġel tajjeb.
And now he was leaving.	U issa kien se jitlaq.
I just did.	Għamilt biss.
Three more years.	Tliet snin oħra.
It needs to happen.	Jeħtieġ li jiġri.
I'm sure he would.	Jien ċert li kieku.
What's behind this door?	X'hemm wara dan il-bieb?
Nothing was as it was before.	Xejn ma kien kif kien qabel.
Not good.	Mhux tajjeb.
You stay home.	Inti toqgħod id-dar.
It probably won't be the last.	Probabbilment ma tkunx l-aħħar.
First time, last time.	L-ewwel darba, l-aħħar darba.
It's about doing.	Huwa dwar tagħmel.
Now, that was when it was ready.	Issa, kien meta kien lest.
I had a lot of problems with this.	Kelli ħafna problemi b'dan.
He just didn’t want to work anything anymore.	Huwa biss ma ried jaħdem xejn aktar.
We may need some help now.	Jista’ jkun li għandna bżonn xi għajnuna issa.
I don't know.	Jien ma nafx.
I didn’t know anyone really did that anymore.	Ma kont naf li xi ħadd verament għamel hekk aktar.
Yours sincerely,	Dejjem tiegħek,
It's about what you do.	Huwa dwar dak li tagħmel.
It's just me.	Huwa biss jien.
Later, he thought.	Aktar tard, ħaseb.
I want to be someone.	Irrid inkun xi ħadd.
But almost only.	Imma kważi biss.
Surely it was my time.	Żgur li kien wasal iż-żmien tiegħi.
We do a lot of things together.	Nagħmlu ħafna affarijiet flimkien.
There is nothing more he can do.	M'hemm xejn aktar li jista 'jagħmel.
He knows he has no chance.	Jaf li m’għandux ċans.
But it didn’t seem likely.	Imma ma deherx probabbli.
I was tired.	Kont għajjien.
No, not much.	Le, mhux ħafna.
He didn’t seem to know he was supposed to be.	Ma jidhirx li kien jaf li suppost kellu jkun.
What no one wanted.	Dak li ħadd ma ried.
That was a bad idea.	Din kienet idea ħażina.
He just came out.	Huwa biss ħareġ.
He has the house.	Għandu d-dar.
So it goes.	Hekk imur.
It was good enough.	Kien tajjeb biżżejjed.
Really, a beautiful thing.	Tassew, ħaġa sabiħa.
He just didn’t want to.	Huwa biss ma riedx.
But there was nothing he could do.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn li seta’ jagħmel.
Not surprised there.	Mhux sorpriż hemm.
He’s there, he won’t leave, there.	Qiegħed hemm, mhux se jitlaq, hemm.
He’s been sitting there for a while.	Ilu bilqiegħda hemm għal xi żmien.
And so it can be.	U hekk jista’ jkun.
I still do.	Għadni nagħmel.
Nor was that what was out there.	Lanqas ma kien dak li kien barra.
He keeps coming back.	Jibqa' jiġi lura'.
That you need this or that.	Li għandek bżonn dan jew dak.
It just takes a long time.	Huwa biss jieħu żmien twil.
You can count on that.	Tista 'toqgħod fuq dan.
It is getting better.	Qed isir aħjar.
People like that.	Nies bħal dik.
Sorry for before.	Jiddispjaċini għal qabel.
If I did, I would be fine.	Jekk għamilt hekk, kont tajjeb.
I just don’t know about it.	Jien biss ma nafx dwar dan.
It's just not.	Huwa biss le.
It should be easy.	Għandu jkun faċli.
He knew everything and nothing.	Kien jaf kollox u xejn.
It doesn’t get any better.	Dan ma jagħmilx aħjar.
I know it looks like a lot.	Naf li jidher qisu ħafna.
It works for me.	Jaħdem għalija.
Surely you can do better than that.	Żgur li tista’ tagħmel aħjar minn hekk.
I really want there to be a way to do that.	Nixtieq tassew li jkun hemm mod kif tagħmel dan.
He hadn't done that either.	Lanqas hekk kien għamel.
They were never without each other.	Qatt ma kienu mingħajr xulxin.
For me, it’s both.	Għalija, huwa t-tnejn.
Okay, you know how she is.	Tajjeb, taf kif hi.
He seemed scared.	Huwa deher jibża.
Everything happens so fast here.	Kollox jiġri hekk malajr hawn.
It seems harder every year.	Jidher aktar diffiċli kull sena.
That was the only way.	Dak kien l-uniku mod.
He seemed very worried.	Kien jidher inkwetat ħafna.
I want to do that.	Irrid li jagħmel dan.
I know a lot of people.	Naf ħafna nies.
He should know that.	Huwa għandu jkun jaf li.
I think they are.	Naħseb li huma.
Well, not you.	Ukoll, mhux int.
In fact no, it’s not.	Fil-fatt le, mhuwiex.
This can be anything.	Dan jista 'jkun xi ħaġa.
He arrived home late last night.	Huwa wasal id-dar tard ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
It was late and everyone was already seated.	Wasal tard u kulħadd kien diġà bilqiegħda.
It is so.	Huwa hekk.
I can do this, no problem.	Jien nista' nagħmel dan, l-ebda problema.
Or maybe you don’t.	Jew forsi m'għandekx.
Okay, he told no one.	Tajjeb, qal lil ħadd.
I don’t know when or how or why.	Ma nafx meta jew kif jew għaliex.
But now you know it’s not that easy.	Imma issa taf li mhux daqshekk faċli.
You had to do what you did.	Kellek tagħmel dak li għamilt.
It already does the same.	Diġà jagħmel l-istess.
But we have, and we can.	Imma għandna, u nistgħu.
It’s something we do.	Hija xi ħaġa li nagħmlu.
I love it that way !.	Inħobb hekk!.
For three hours. 	Għal tliet sigħat. 
He knows he is doing wrong.	Jaf li qed jagħmel ħażin.
No one will ever know this.	Ħadd qatt mhu se jkun jaf dan.
I have never seen anything like this before.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din qabel.
But they were there for more than that.	Imma kienu hemm għal aktar minn hekk.
But it was too late.	Imma kienet tard wisq.
I can’t take it anymore.	Ma nistax nieħu aktar.
This is not easy at all.	Dan mhu faċli xejn.
I know this very well.	Dan naf tajjeb ħafna.
I really believe he wanted this.	Verament nemmen li ried dan.
You know you’re not supposed to be here.	Taf li mhux suppost tkun hawn.
This was not doing well.	Dan ma kienx qed jagħmel tajjeb.
He did it.	Huwa għamel dan.
Now, if you will just.	Issa, jekk inti ser biss.
No way is that a chance.	L-ebda mod ma hu ċans li.
But we just had a good time.	Imma biss kellna ħin tajjeb.
One way works for a while.	Mod wieħed jaħdem għal żmien.
That should be fine.	Dan għandu jkun tajjeb.
But everyone should.	Imma kulħadd għandu.
I wanted more.	Ridt aktar.
I know there is nothing behind it.	Naf li m'hemm xejn lura.
The only way.	L-uniku mod.
Easy is harder.	Faċli huwa aktar diffiċli.
Only, he didn’t have enough time.	Biss, ma kellux biżżejjed ħin.
Most likely it will.	Probabbli ħafna li se.
He is afraid to do what is right.	Jibża’ li tagħmel dak li hu tajjeb.
You don’t need to do anything more.	M'għandekx bżonn tagħmel xejn aktar.
He lost that one.	Huwa tilef dak wieħed.
And it's not.	U mhuwiex.
It may be the same for you.	Jista 'jkun l-istess għalik.
He didn’t seem so interested.	Ma deherx daqshekk interessat.
Se nara li dan.	Se nara li dan.
It's too many people.	Huwa wisq nies.
She really did a good job.	Hi tassew għamlet xogħol tajjeb.
Not alone.	Mhux waħdu.
If something had happened it would have happened now.	Kieku ġara xi ħaġa kien jiġri issa.
If so, you know.	Kieku hekk, tkun taf.
Bad is good.	Ħażin huwa tajjeb.
I don’t want to know.	Ma rridx inkun naf.
There was no one unemployed.	Ma kien hemm ħadd bla xogħol.
I can never believe it.	Qatt nista' nemmen jien.
Come on if you like.	Ejja jekk tixtieq.
There should be more to this.	Għandu jkun hemm aktar għal dan.
Home is the home.	Id-dar hija d-dar.
We don't have that.	Aħna m'għandniex hekk.
Not sure who said that first.	Mhux ċert min qal dan l-ewwel.
Maybe someone knows more.	Forsi xi ħadd jaf aktar.
Time to do what is right.	Żmien li tagħmel dak li hu tajjeb.
Worth a try.	Ta’ min jipprova.
I have never seen it before.	Qatt ma rajt qabel.
It could have been a lot or a little.	Seta’ kien ħafna jew ftit.
And for a long time nothing happened.	U għal żmien twil ma ġara xejn.
She has been home for so many years.	Kienet id-dar għal tant snin.
It's there.	Huwa hemmhekk.
He doesn’t want to talk about it.	Ma jridx jitkellem dwarha.
But not fast enough.	Imma mhux malajr biżżejjed.
This is happening.	Dan qed jiġri.
He was late, sure.	Huwa kien tard, żgur.
He’s tired, and not quite well.	Huwa għajjien, u mhux pjuttost tajjeb.
More and more and more and more.	Aktar u aktar u aktar u aktar.
Maybe it would be better if he didn’t say anything.	Forsi jkun aħjar jekk ma qal xejn.
Maybe he was a man.	Forsi kien raġel.
Neither are we.	Lanqas aħna.
Li sar.	Li sar.
My dog ​​will stay with me.	Il-kelb tiegħi se jibqa’ miegħi.
Not so much.	Mhux daqshekk ħafna.
Maybe a year.	Forsi sena.
I haven’t really worked with him yet.	Għadni ma tantx għamilt xogħol miegħu.
Now it's late.	Issa huwa tard.
That would be great.	Dan ikun kbir.
Plus it was good.	Barra minn hekk kienet tajba.
Let’s do this now.	Ejja nagħmlu dan issa.
And it happens.	U dan jiġri.
And she will do well.	U hi se tagħmel tajjeb.
I had no idea what it was.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'kien.
No one asked.	Ħadd ma staqsa.
Everything is yours.	Kollox huwa tiegħek.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Jiddispjaċini li qed nisma 'din.
I had to do everything myself.	Kelli nagħmel kollox jien.
He said nothing more and did not need to.	Ma qal xejn aktar u ma kellux bżonn.
She had to come back to him.	Hija kellha tiġi lura għalih.
I doubt that.	Niddubita dan.
We did very well.	Għamilna tajjeb ħafna.
Quick about it, you?	Malajr dwar dan, inti?
And it works very well.	U jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
He should know.	Għandu jkun jaf.
But you've.	Imma inti stajt.
That was his job.	Dak kien ix-xogħol tiegħu.
Which is where we will be.	Li huwa fejn se nkunu.
Today we have only.	Illum għandna biss.
I don’t know where he was from.	Ma nafx minn fejn kien.
I meant.	Ridt ngħid.
It's not hard to see why.	Mhux diffiċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
But they really are.	Imma huma verament.
That was wrong.	Li kien ħażin.
But about my friend here.	Imma dwar ħabib tiegħi hawn.
It should be about now.	Għandu jkun dwar issa.
There was a lot to see.	Kien hemm ħafna x'tara.
Nothing more than that.	Xejn aktar minn hekk.
That is what he said.	Dan huwa dak li qal.
I hope it will help.	Nittama li se jgħin.
It is something else.	Hija xi ħaġa oħra.
I know what she wants.	Naf xi trid hi.
You can eat any time you want.	Tista' tiekol kull ħin li trid.
I’ve been there many times.	Jien kont hemm ħafna drabi.
I can't understand anything later.	Ma nista’ nifhem xejn wara.
Well, not much.	Ukoll, mhux ħafna.
Nobody told me that.	Ħadd ma qalli li jkun hekk.
We probably know each other.	Probabbilment nafu lil xulxin.
There will never be another.	Qatt mhu se jkun hemm ieħor.
It was too big.	Kien kbir wisq.
It is something more.	Hija xi ħaġa aktar.
You know your home.	Taf id-dar tiegħek.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Ma nafx x’inhu ħażin miegħi.
It shouldn’t be that hard.	M'għandux ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
What we will do long ago.	Dak li se nagħmlu ilu.
He did such a good job.	Huwa għamel xogħol daqshekk tajjeb.
It was coming from above.	Kien ġej minn fuq.
Well, he couldn't do anything about it.	Ukoll, ma seta’ jagħmel xejn dwar dan.
I think this really is.	Naħseb li dan huwa tassew.
I haven’t seen any of this.	Jien ma rajt xejn minn dan.
No, she won't.	Le, hi mhux se.
He was not there.	Hu ma kienx hemm.
I think it was just me.	Naħseb li kont jien biss.
If I were, school would come first.	Kieku jien, l-iskola tiġi l-ewwel.
That was a good idea.	Din kienet idea tajba.
There is some way to go back to this problem.	Hemm xi mod kif wieħed imur lura għal din il-problema.
That book is this book.	Dak il-ktieb huwa dan il-ktieb.
Now he is.	Issa hu.
No one wins if that happens.	Ħadd ma jirbaħ jekk jiġri hekk.
And we did well.	U għamilna tajjeb.
With this book.	B'dan il-ktieb.
Too much, maybe.	Wisq, forsi.
You will never see me now.	Inti qatt ma tiġi tara lili issa.
He knew who was talking.	Kien jaf min kien qed jitkellem.
Which is what we do.	Li huwa dak li nagħmlu.
I'm glad you came.	Jien kuntent li ġejt.
It looked like it had to be someone else.	Deher li kellu jkun xi ħadd ieħor.
, Not me.	, Mhux jien.
If it happened.	Jekk ġara.
Not nearly as much as it should be.	Mhux kważi daqskemm għandu jkun.
Not the car.	Mhux il-karozza.
I have never done this before.	Qatt ma għamilt dan qabel.
She must have been.	Hija trid kienet.
But it doesn’t have to be my house.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun id-dar tiegħi.
Everyone is fine.	Kulħadd huwa tajjeb.
That was for other people.	Dak kien għal nies oħra.
Not bad.	Mhuwiex ħażin.
It's that they were already there.	Huwa li kienu diġà hemm.
I heard about it.	Smajt dwarha.
He is currently afraid to do the job.	Bħalissa qed jibża’ jagħmel ix-xogħol.
They were really right on that.	Kienu verament raġun fuq dik.
It was really not bad as it seemed.	Kien verament mhux ħażin kif deher.
He said it will not work.	Qal li mhux se jaħdem.
He’s just better than me today.	Hu biss aħjar minni llum.
Everyone happy, too happy.	Kulħadd kuntent, kuntent wisq.
Plus, there was something about it.	Barra minn hekk, kien hemm xi ħaġa dwarha.
He seemed surprised by this.	Huwa deher sorpriż b'dan.
This will make your job a lot easier.	Dan se jagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħek ħafna aktar faċli.
In fact I have.	Fil-fatt għandi.
You will too.	Int tkun ukoll.
That's not it either.	Dik lanqas.
He will not be back.	Hu mhux se jkun lura.
And he was a good man for you.	U kien raġel tajjeb għalik.
You don't even have to think about it.	Lanqas m’għandekx għalfejn taħseb dwarha.
But it happens.	Imma jiġri.
With me you know where you are going.	Miegħi taf fejn sejjer.
I was ready to do anything.	Kont lest li nagħmel xi ħaġa.
I doubt most people have.	Niddubita li ħafna nies għandhom.
You are also happy.	Int ukoll kuntent.
Maybe, maybe just.	Forsi, forsi biss.
Well, it’s already as bad as it is.	Ukoll, diġà huwa ħażin daqs kemm hu.
For that time.	Għal dak iż-żmien.
Really, it shouldn’t.	Tassew, m'għandux.
But he’s not here right now, and you.	Imma hu mhux hawn bħalissa, u int.
That is not enough.	Dan mhux biżżejjed.
I have school and things.	Għandi l-iskola u l-affarijiet.
Good.	Tajjeb.
He will be here for a long time.	Huwa se jkun hawn għal żmien twil.
That was what she needed.	Dan kien dak li kellha bżonn.
I was pretty right.	Kont pjuttost raġun.
This cannot be done.	Dan ma jistax isir.
I could never see this.	Qatt ma stajt nara dan.
This should be easy to do.	Dan għandu jkun faċli li tagħmel.
That will be the last.	Dik se tkun l-aħħar.
I’m sure I’ve seen this happen before.	Jien ċert li rajt dan jiġri qabel.
As we do.	Kif nagħmlu aħna.
I'm too late.	Jien tard wisq.
fi.	fi.
This has never been a problem for us.	Din qatt ma kienet problema għalina.
Look at this because.	Ħares lejn dan għaliex.
It is usually very busy.	Normalment ikun okkupat ħafna.
I'm not good at being alone.	Jien mhux tajjeb li nkun waħdi.
To if.	Biex jekk.
In fact, it's probably both.	Fil-fatt, huwa probabbilment it-tnejn.
It just happens.	Dan jiġri biss.
That's a lot of work.	Dak huwa ħafna xogħol.
We will do something good.	Se nagħmlu xi ħaġa tajba.
I have never seen anything like it.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din.
Come on, find out what's going on.	Ejja, taf x'qed jiġri.
A long time ago.	Żmien twil ilu.
I’ve never been on anyone.	Jien qatt ma ġejt fuq ħadd.
It was school.	Kien l-iskola.
That works well.	Li jaħdem tajjeb.
Looks like nothing ever happened.	Qisu qatt ma ġara xejn.
And it often is.	U spiss ikun.
It's just us.	Huwa biss aħna.
I don’t think that happens today.	Ma naħsibx li jiġri llum.
You are with me.	Int miegħi.
She had made a good time.	Hija kienet għamlet ħin tajjeb.
I hear what you say.	Nisma' dak li tgħid.
There wasn’t much more he could do from here.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna aktar li jista 'jagħmel minn hawn.
I love that too.	Jien inħobb lil dak ukoll.
It’s hard to say what you’re talking about.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid dak li qed titkellem.
It needs work.	Jeħtieġ xogħol.
I will think more about this.	Se naħseb aktar dwar dan.
No one wants that.	Ħadd ma jrid dan.
I knew it would.	Kont naf li kieku.
I would like a little more than what was there.	Nixtieq xi ftit aktar minn dak li kien hemm.
It had all happened before.	Kulħadd qabel hekk kien ġara.
Nothing works here.	Xejn ma jaħdem hawn.
I have together here.	Għandi flimkien hawn.
It's just here.	Hemm biss hawn.
Or from here.	Jew minn hawn.
We each took one for each.	Aħna kull wieħed ħa wieħed għal kull wieħed.
Tired a few other times.	Għajjien xi ftit drabi oħra.
And there won’t be.	U mhux se jkun hemm.
He will never go back.	Qatt mhu se jmur lura.
He wasn’t doing anything like that.	Ma kienx jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik.
Or do some work.	Jew tagħmel xi xogħol.
There were too many people.	Kien hemm wisq nies.
We knew better.	Konna nafu aħjar.
Everyone says that.	Kulħadd jgħid dan.
So and so.	Hekk u hekk.
That’s not about it.	Dak mhux dwarha.
She was alone in the room.	Kienet waħedha fil-kamra.
Like everyone else.	Bħal kulħadd.
I have been on the problem for quite some time.	Ilni fuq il-problema għal żmien pjuttost twil.
There may be another problem.	Jista 'jkun hemm problema oħra.
But very good.	Imma tajjeb ħafna.
He never came more than that.	Hu qatt ma wasal aktar minn hekk.
If you think you can do it, you will.	Jekk taħseb li tista 'tagħmel dan, inti se.
It could never happen.	Qatt ma seta’ jiġri.
I would really like to understand why.	Nixtieq tassew nifhem għaliex.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
No one could say.	Ħadd ma seta’ jgħid.
There had to be a way.	Kellu jkun hemm mod.
Not everyone is the same.	Kulħadd mhux l-istess.
You have to do the work.	Int trid tagħmel ix-xogħol.
That morning.	Dak filgħodu.
Now I have one.	Issa għandi waħda.
That shouldn’t say, but there is.	Dan m'għandux jgħid, imma hemm.
It looked like.	Deher qisu.
I’m not what you should be worried about.	Jien mhux dak li għandek tkun inkwetat dwarha.
He’s really happy there.	Huwa tassew kuntent hemmhekk.
He won’t be driving anything anymore.	Mhu se jkun qed isuq xejn aktar.
I would never have done that today, of course.	Jien qatt ma kont nagħmel dan illum, ovvjament.
I don’t think one is easier than another.	Ma naħsibx li wieħed huwa aktar faċli minn ieħor.
Nothing happens.	Ma jiġri xejn.
Everyone seemed surprised.	Kulħadd deher sorpriż.
But, you see.	Imma, tara.
And we're pretty sure it will.	U aħna pjuttost ċert li se.
He thought otherwise.	Huwa ħaseb mod ieħor.
It was good for such things.	Kien tajjeb għal affarijiet bħal dawn.
I’ll see more tonight.	Ser nara aktar illejla.
Hu.	Hu.
This is a long time.	Dan huwa żmien twil.
I love it !!!!!.	Jien inħobb!!!!!.
Everything that was there, was there to try.	Dak kollu li kien hemm, kien hemm biex jipprova.
He wanted to do it alone.	Huwa ried jagħmel dan waħdu.
I'm a morning person.	Jien persuna filgħodu.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Xejn, xejn, xejn.
I wish so.	Jien nixtieq hekk.
But this was my home.	Imma din kienet id-dar tiegħi.
I never was and never will be.	Qatt ma kont u qatt ma se nkun.
I was right.	Kelli raġun.
He wanted to drive.	Ried isuq.
She wasn't telling anyone why.	Ma kienet tgħid lil ħadd għaliex.
I shouldn't do that.	M'għandix nagħmel dan.
He was dead.	Huwa kien miet.
You could tell they were.	Tista 'tgħid li kienu.
I’d be happy to say whatever you want, you know.	Inkun kuntent ngħid dak kollu li tixtieq, taf.
And by then, it would be too late !.	U sa dak iż-żmien, ikun tard wisq!.
I never know when it will appear.	Qatt ma naf meta se jidher.
I, of course, did not.	Jien, ovvjament, ma kontx.
Wrong again!	Mill-ġdid ħażin!
Do something.	Tagħmel xi ħaġa.
It was enough, he thought.	Kien biżżejjed, ħaseb.
Or maybe not for you.	Jew forsi mhux għalik.
How much is this?	Kemm hu dan?
There is no way that can ever happen.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li jista 'qatt jiġri.
This makes things easier.	Dan jagħmel l-affarijiet aktar faċli.
Not together, of course.	Mhux flimkien, ovvjament.
This has been done before.	Dan sar qabel.
I have this.	Għandi dan.
I like to listen.	Inħobb nisma’.
That was something else he wasn't thinking about.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa oħra li ma kienx qed jaħseb dwarha.
But this is not it.	Imma dan huwa le.
So was everyone.	Hekk kien kulħadd.
It wasn’t hard for him.	Ma kienx diffiċli għalih.
This was too small.	Dan kien żgħir wisq.
I didn’t even have a friend.	Jien lanqas biss kelli ħabib.
It will remain easy, or perhaps easier.	Se jibqa 'faċli, jew forsi aktar faċli.
It still works.	Għadu jaħdem.
He said he needed a lot of time.	Qal li kellu bżonn ħafna ħin.
He is driving.	Qed isuq.
I don’t know what it is.	Ma nafx x'inhu.
He could see that it was working and asked how.	Seta’ jara li kien qed jaħdem u staqsa kif.
Until now I wasn’t really sure.	Sa issa ma kienx verament ċert.
This was so easy and quick to do.	Dan kien daqshekk faċli u malajr biex isir.
I have my way.	Jien għandi mod tiegħi.
As she was.	Kif kienet hi.
I'm worried about it.	Jien inkwetat dwarha.
I like that he just wants to work.	Inħobb li jrid jaħdem biss.
You think.	Int taħseb.
Maybe this helps.	Forsi dan jgħin.
No, we didn't.	Le, aħna ma.
That will happen.	Dak se jiġri.
Whatever, whatever.	Ikun xi jkun, ikun.
Nor will we.	Lanqas se nkunu.
Always and forever.	Dejjem u għal dejjem.
It happens too fast too.	Jiġri wisq malajr wisq.
I know it can’t be easy.	Naf li ma jistax ikun faċli.
It was me.	Jien kont jien.
I will never know.	Qatt ma nkun naf.
This is pretty much it.	Dan huwa pjuttost ħafna.
I know enough.	Naf biżżejjed.
He was surprised.	Huwa kien sorpriż.
One knew how it looked.	Wieħed kien jaf kif deher.
So was everything else.	Hekk kienet kull ħaġa oħra.
This I am.	Dan jien.
Always has, always will.	Dejjem għandu, dejjem se.
Everything you need is there.	Dak kollu li għandek bżonn qiegħed hemm.
I said he died.	Għidt li miet.
No one could do that.	Ħadd ma seta’ jagħmel dan.
I was right for you.	Kont tajjeb għalik.
Today, both are back and better than before.	Illum, it-tnejn huma lura u aħjar minn qabel.
I'm still scared.	Għadni nibża.
For many, probably not.	Għal ħafna, probabbilment le.
But it is still there.	Imma għadu hemm.
I did a lot of work here for him.	Għamilt ħafna xogħol hawn għalih.
Very, very much.	Ħafna, ħafna.
They do this.	Dan jagħmlu.
He loved to play.	Kien iħobb jilgħab.
He couldn't help it.	Ma setax jgħin.
I know exactly where I'm going.	Naf eżatt fejn sejjer.
They are something else.	Huma xi ħaġa oħra.
Something you want to know.	Xi ħaġa li trid tkun taf.
I have another.	Għandi ieħor.
She looked pretty.	Hija ħares pjuttost.
You were helpful.	Int kont ta' għajnuna.
But it was time to leave.	Imma kien wasal iż-żmien li jitlaq.
He played me.	Huwa kellu lili.
And there is my problem.	U hemm il-problema tiegħi.
She was so good to me.	Kienet daqshekk tajba miegħi.
I'm not sure what to expect.	M'inix ċert x'qed jistenna.
I’m still waiting, actually.	Għadni nistenna, fil-fatt.
He can be a very difficult man.	Jista’ jkun raġel diffiċli ħafna.
You are who you are and so on.	Int min int u hekk.
This will not happen.	Dan mhux se jiġri.
This will always be you.	Din tkun dejjem int.
But today is not easy.	Imma llum mhux faċli.
I think it was.	Naħseb li kien.
I have seen this a lot.	Rajt dan ħafna.
I can’t believe no one helps.	Ma nistax nemmen li ħadd ma jgħin.
And he was a good friend.	U kien ħabib tajjeb.
That would be wrong.	Dan ikun ħażin.
You wanted me.	Inti ridt lili.
You know why you're like this.	Taf għaliex int bħal dan.
Maybe I saw these.	Forsi rajt dawn.
It was just a problem.	Kien biss problema.
But only if you want to.	Imma biss jekk trid.
I wanted to do everything and everything.	Ridt li tagħmel kollox u kollox.
All the while, I was waiting there.	Il-ħin kollu, kont qed nistenna hemm.
He looked tired.	Huwa deher għajjien.
I won't.	Jien mhux se.
I can be a teacher.	Nista’ nkun għalliem.
And not as she always had.	U mhux kif dejjem kellha.
Is this or nothing.	Huwa dan jew xejn.
Maybe it would be good.	Forsi jkun tajjeb.
Well, for us.	Ukoll, għalina.
It will happen.	Se jiġri.
.	.
He had just said that.	Huwa kellu biss qal li.
I need that book.	Għandi bżonn dak il-ktieb.
It has been here for a long time.	Kien ilu hawn.
I’m sure a good friend.	Jien ċert ħabib tajjeb.
It's been a long time coming.	Kien żmien twil ġej.
I’m back at work.	Jien lura fuq ix-xogħol.
He was not going home.	Ma kienx sejjer id-dar.
Someone wants to know.	Xi ħadd irid ikun jaf.
She is a good person.	Hija persuna tajba.
It happens that we seem to be so wrong.	Jiġri li jidher li għandna hekk ħażin.
That was it.	Dan kien.
He now had to stay in the car.	Issa kellu jibqa’ fuq il-karozza.
There can be no more.	Ma jistax ikun hemm aktar.
He looked, too.	Huwa ħares, ukoll.
There will be a better time.	Ikun hemm żmien aħjar.
She talks about everything.	Hi titkellem dwar kollox.
I am very sorry for this.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal dan.
Maybe not for long.	Forsi mhux għal żmien twil.
Can you tell me something.	Tista' tgħidli xi ħaġa.
i don't want anything.	ma rrid xejn.
No one came to see what was happening.	Ħadd ma ġie biex jara x’kien qed jiġri.
On and on and on.	Fuq u fuq u fuq.
He was there, of course.	Huwa kien hemm, ovvjament.
I’m not sure anyone else can really.	M'inix ċert li xi ħadd ieħor jista' verament.
I'm not going to tell you.	Jien mhux se ngħidlek.
I know where everyone lives.	Naf fejn jgħix kulħadd.
It was the last.	Kien l-aħħar.
I do more.	Nagħmel aktar.
But it wasn’t fast enough.	Imma ma kienx malajr biżżejjed.
I think he is.	Naħseb li hu.
I’ve been watching for hours and hours.	Stajt nara għal sigħat u sigħat.
He was just sitting there.	Kien biss bilqiegħda hemm.
I just wasn't ready.	I biss ma kienx lest.
We had everything there.	Kellna kollox hemmhekk.
And we need more than that around.	U għandna bżonn aktar minn dak madwar.
Whatever you are thinking.	Tkun xi tkun qed taħseb.
This is already happening.	Dan diġà qed jiġri.
Worried about it.	Inkwetat dwarha.
I had seen this before but it was years ago.	Jien kont rajt dan qabel imma kien snin ilu.
But it's getting late.	Imma qed isir tard.
I don’t want to do these things.	Ma rridx nagħmel dawn l-affarijiet.
It’s a really good thing, really, really good.	Hija ħaġa tassew tajba, tassew, tassew tajba.
I have never done anything like this before.	Qatt ma għamilt xi ħaġa bħal din qabel.
I don’t know what will happen.	Ma nafx x'se jiġri.
You were there you know.	Kont hemm taf.
How should he know?	Kif kellu jkun jaf?
Nobody does.	Ħadd ma jagħmel.
We want a man like that.	Irridu raġel bħal dan.
This is what we know for sure.	Dan huwa dak li nafu żgur.
I hadn’t heard that.	Jien ma kontx smajt dan.
One is never enough.	Wieħed qatt mhu biżżejjed.
I was.	Jien kont.
I saw his things.	Rajt l-affarijiet tiegħu.
I believe it is wrong.	Nemmen li huwa ħażin.
No more will.	Mhux aktar se.
I don't talk to anyone.	Jien ma nitkellem ma’ ħadd.
I did something wrong.	Għamilt xi ħaġa ħażina.
I can’t wait to try.	Ma nistax nistenna biex nipprova.
I love that car.	Inħobb dik il-karozza.
You are so good at talking about something.	Inti daqshekk tajjeb biex titkellem dwar xi ħaġa.
That was the truth.	Din kienet il-verità.
I just need to know.	Għandi bżonn biss li tkun taf.
Really? 	Tassew?
she says.	hi tgħid.
I knew she was right.	Kont naf li kellha raġun.
He could not leave.	Ma setax jitlaq.
That would be a very big thing.	Dan ikun xi ħaġa kbira ħafna.
He knew how to do it right.	Huwa kien jaf kif jagħmel dan tajjeb.
There is nothing you can do.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel.
You have a problem now!	Għandek problema issa!
They just have each other.	Huma għandhom biss lil xulxin.
I’m really afraid not.	Jien tassew nibża li le.
We did it together.	Għamilna flimkien.
It won’t be his last, but he still doesn’t know.	Mhux se jkun l-aħħar tiegħu, imma għadu ma jafx.
But it probably does.	Imma probabbilment hekk jagħmel.
No, no it won't.	Le, le mhux se.
I think there’s something you want from me.	Naħseb li hemm xi ħaġa li trid minni.
Or maybe not for you.	Jew forsi mhux għalik.
I didn’t see anyone around.	Ma rajt lil ħadd madwar.
It seemed that his friend was not.	Deher li ħabib tiegħu ma kienx.
Not me.	Mhux lili.
They were my friends.	Kienu ħbieb tiegħi.
I want it to be beautiful.	Nixtieq li tkun sabiħa.
Everyone was here.	Kulħadd kien hawn.
It should not be done.	M'għandux isir.
But nothing like this was happening.	Imma xejn bħal dan ma kien qed jiġri.
It’s hard to tell unless it’s there.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid sakemm ma tkunx hemm.
There was a good time here once.	Kien hemm żmien tajjeb hawn darba.
I’ve understood it very well.	Stajt nifhem tajjeb ħafna.
There is a lot to know.	Hemm ħafna li tkun taf.
He did it.	Huwa għamel dan.
She had done so.	Hija kienet għamlet hekk.
I often thought how it would be.	Ħsibt spiss kif ikun.
He was afraid not to.	Huwa kien jibża li ma.
I can't do that.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan.
There he is.	Hemm hu.
He doesn’t seem to want to talk about it.	Jidher li ma riedx jitkellem dwarha.
Anyone can see that.	Kulħadd jista 'jara li.
This had nothing to do with it.	Dan ma kellu xejn.
Only time will tell what will happen.	Iż-żmien biss jista’ jgħid x’se jiġri.
I had to know in advance.	I kellha naf minn qabel.
That wasn’t so good.	Dak ma kienx daqshekk tajjeb.
I've been here before, haven't I?	Kont hawn qabel, hux?
It's my job.	Huwa xogħol tiegħi.
I want to say something.	Irrid ngħid xi ħaġa.
Maybe, maybe we can.	Forsi, forsi nistgħu.
It went well for a while.	Huwa mar tajjeb għal xi żmien.
This is how it looks.	Dan huwa kif jidher.
I was the only one who knew where she was, you see.	Jien kont l-uniku wieħed li kien jaf fejn kienet, tara.
I hear things.	Nisma affarijiet.
I go to him.	Immur għandu.
So she says.	Hekk tgħid hi.
I was not happy.	Ma kontx kuntent.
In fact, he could probably play anything.	Fil-fatt, huwa probabbilment jista 'jilgħab xi ħaġa.
It takes work.	Huwa jieħu xogħol.
I have just started.	Għadni kemm beda.
My work can be seen here and here.	Ix-xogħol tiegħi jista' jidher hawn u hawn.
And no one does anything about it.	U ħadd ma jagħmel xejn dwarha.
That will do.	Li se tagħmel.
You definitely want to know that.	Inti żgur trid tkun taf li.
It was time!	Kien wasal iż-żmien!
It's probably wrong.	Probabbilment huwa ħażin.
Now don’t do that.	Issa ma jagħmilx hekk.
She wants to know.	Hija trid tkun taf.
He has done such things before.	Huwa għamel affarijiet bħal dawn qabel.
But not like before.	Imma mhux bħal qabel.
Are you sure you know what you are doing?	Int żgur li taf x'qed tagħmel?
It works for both of us.	Huwa jaħdem għalina t-tnejn.
That was easy.	Dik kienet faċli.
I don’t want to do that.	Ma rridx nagħmel hekk.
And you would be right, there wasn’t much.	U int tkun raġun, ma kienx hemm ħafna.
And eat something.	U tiekol xi ħaġa.
You know, that’s just great.	Taf, li huwa biss kbir.
But he is right.	Imma għandu raġun.
Today so.	Illum hekk.
She didn’t have to say anything.	Ma kellha tgħid xejn.
Or it may not be his.	Jew jista 'ma jkunx tiegħu.
This is already happening.	Dan diġà qed jiġri.
You said I was sure.	Int għidt li kont żgur.
There is nothing you can do about it now.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan issa.
All or nothing, he said.	Kollox jew xejn, qal.
He knows you're not what he wants you to be.	Jaf li m’intix dak li jrid hu.
He says do it, but not tomorrow.	Jgħid tagħmel dan, imma mhux għada.
Not a bit one.	Mhux daqsxejn wieħed.
He didn’t want to come here.	Ma riedx jiġi hawn.
See what happened.	Ra x’kien ġara.
I'm sorry.	Jiddispjaċini.
This is really good to see.	Dan huwa verament tajjeb biex tara.
It was there.	Kien hemm.
Plus, it was more than that.	Barra minn hekk, kien aktar minn hekk.
It's not that easy.	Mhuwiex daqshekk faċli li.
But how? 	Imma kif?
He’s right, of course.	Huwa għandu raġun, ovvjament.
I do something back.	Nagħmel xi ħaġa lura.
That would be difficult.	Dan ikun diffiċli.
I wanted to be his.	Jien ridt inkun tiegħu.
I must have done something right.	I għandu għamilt xi ħaġa tajba.
That's who you are.	Dak hu min int.
We did both.	Għamilna t-tnejn.
But it would not be so easy.	Imma ma jkunx daqshekk faċli.
I'll have to try again.	Ikolli nerġa' nipprova.
I want to go.	Irrid immur.
I know you are not coming.	Naf li m'intix ġej.
You too.	Int ukoll.
I was trying.	Kont qed nipprova.
He could barely speak.	Ma tantx seta’ jitkellem.
We don’t need it anymore.	M'għandniex bżonn aktar.
It's all over now.	Huwa kollox issa.
I like it a lot.	Inħobb ħafna.
I like to go a lot.	Inħobb immur ħafna.
Now he doesn’t want to play anything.	Issa ma jridx jilgħab xejn.
If they ever were.	Kieku qatt kienu.
No one was interested.	Ħadd ma kien interessat.
Your time and mine may still be long.	Il-ħin tiegħek u tiegħi jista' jkun li għadu twil.
She says she did wrong.	Tgħid li għamel ħażin.
It was something she usually would never do.	Kienet xi ħaġa li hi normalment qatt ma kienet tagħmel.
I know he is right.	Naf li għandu raġun.
He has a lot of money	Għandu ħafna flus
It's hard to do everything.	Huwa diffiċli li tagħmel kollox.
I can’t wait to be the last.	Ma nistax nistenna li nkun l-aħħar.
Ask where they were.	Staqsa fejn kienu.
I wasn’t ready for that.	Jien ma kontx lest għal dan.
It was about noon.	Kien madwar nofsinhar.
It wasn't.	Ma kienx.
I'm the only one who can talk about it.	Jien l-unika waħda li tista’ titkellem dwar dan.
She thinks something is wrong.	Hi taħseb xi ħaġa ħażina.
That’s something we do.	Dik hija xi ħaġa li nagħmlu.
To see.	Biex tara.
Something has always been.	Xi ħaġa dejjem kienet.
But here you are again.	Imma hawn int mill-ġdid.
It was the only chance we had.	Kien l-uniku ċans li kellna.
Well, not me.	Ukoll, mhux jien.
Why? 	Għalfejn?
This was a great time.	Dan kien żmien kbir.
We had everything we needed and more.	Kellna dak kollu li kellna bżonn u aktar.
I’m interested to see more.	Jien interessat li nara aktar.
Everyone is having fun.	Kulħadd qed jieħu gost.
We don’t have much time.	M'għandniex ħafna ħin.
And maybe they are.	U forsi huma.
Better to say it never happened.	Aħjar ngħid li qatt ma ġara.
You’re sure, very sure.	Int żgur, ċert ħafna.
I'll talk to you later.	I ser nitkellem miegħek aktar tard.
But there is only so much we can do.	Imma hemm biss tant li nistgħu nagħmlu.
There may be a way.	Jista 'jkun hemm mod.
That was coming for him.	Dak kien ġej għalih.
But maybe it was.	Imma forsi kien.
Help! 	Għajnuna!
help! 	għajnuna!
The problem is another.	Il-problema hija oħra.
I just wanted to be sure.	Ridt biss inkun ċert.
Anyone who wants to.	Kull min irid.
I really think this is the only way.	Verament naħseb li dan huwa l-uniku mod.
Just what can happen.	Biss dak li jista 'jiġri.
Or rather, no.	Jew aħjar, le.
It was going to happen.	Kien se jiġri.
I don’t know how that happened.	Ma nafx kif ġara dan.
That took a lot of work.	Dak ħa ħafna xogħol.
Everyone now before.	Kulħadd issa qabel.
It was now morning.	Issa kien filgħodu.
It's just not me.	Huwa biss mhux jien.
How she knew she didn’t know.	Kif kienet taf li ma kinitx taf.
I was never one to sit down.	Qatt ma kont wieħed li noqgħod bilqiegħda.
It was so.	Kien hekk.
There she is now.	Hemm hi issa.
When did this happen?	Meta ġara dan?
And they are always there for each other.	U huma dejjem hemm għal xulxin.
It was worth a try.	Kien min jipprova.
I like to stay here.	Inħobb noqgħod hawn.
She definitely had something.	Żgur li kellha xi ħaġa.
But you have to.	Imma għandek.
So he did.	Hekk għamel dan.
You are worried.	Inti inkwetat.
I tell you.	Jien ngħidlek.
It was great, as always.	Kien kbir, bħal dejjem.
It's not there.	Mhuwiex hemm.
No one is coming.	Ħadd mhu ġej.
What you see is what you have.	Dak li tara huwa dak li għandek.
I thought it was there forever.	Ħsibt li kien hemm għal dejjem.
Like a little boy.	Bħal tifel żgħir.
I think it won’t be long.	Naħseb li mhux se jkun twil.
But there was a big problem.	Imma kien hemm problema kbira.
I'll tell you everything later.	Ngħidlek kollox aktar tard.
Nothing like this.	Xejn bħal dan.
This will work.	Dan se jaħdem.
He had the house.	Kellu d-dar.
That's too long.	Dak huwa twil wisq.
I don’t believe anything.	Jien ma nemmen xejn.
That's there.	Dak hemm.
I still couldn’t believe this was happening.	Għadni ma stajtx nemmen li dan kien qed jiġri.
There was no one else.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor.
It's just me here.	Huwa biss jien hawn.
He is coming home.	Huwa ġej id-dar.
I was pretty sure everyone knew.	Kont pjuttost ċert li kulħadd kien jaf.
And you just.	U int biss.
More than surprised.	Aktar minn sorpriż.
Obviously something was wrong.	Ovvjament xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
But it’s a beautiful thing.	Imma hija ħaġa sabiħa.
Which is good for me.	Li huwa tajjeb minni.
Maybe too much.	Forsi wisq.
But he wasn’t so sure.	Imma ma kienx daqshekk ċert.
It won’t be long for me.	Mhux se jkun twil għalija.
It is not going to work.	Mhux sejjer jaħdem.
When you do you know.	Meta tagħmel inti tkun taf.
After all, he was just a boy.	Wara kollox, kien biss tifel.
Nothing he had.	Xejn kellu.
Easy how to make friends.	Faċli kif tagħmel ħbieb.
That works well.	Li jaħdem ukoll.
He had gone too far.	Huwa kien mar wisq.
They never do.	Huma qatt ma jagħmlu.
He knows something.	Jaf xi ħaġa.
I often do.	Ħafna drabi nagħmel.
You will be here with us.	Int tkun hawn magħna.
Not so, my friends.	Mhux hekk, ħbieb tiegħi.
He can say he wants to.	Jista’ jgħid li jrid.
It’s a really bad one.	Huwa wieħed tassew ħażin.
I will not be there.	Jien mhux se nkun hemm.
And maybe you will.	U forsi se.
If you don’t want to do that.	Jekk ma tridx tagħmel dan.
That's a problem.	Dik hija problema.
We can't and we shouldn't.	Ma nistgħux u m’għandniex.
It seems so.	Jidher hekk.
Where did you die	Fejn mort?
He had to come back.	Kellu jiġi lura.
It had happened.	Kien ġara.
More and more, and more.	Aktar u aktar, u aktar.
I will not say.	Mhux se ngħid.
I can’t understand what’s wrong.	Ma nistax nifhem x'inhu ħażin.
You know, like mine.	Taf, bħal tiegħi.
There is something you should know.	Hemm xi ħaġa li għandek tkun taf.
There have been other people here lately.	Kien hemm nies oħra hawn dan l-aħħar.
I thought it was something like that.	Ħsibt li kienet xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I will never be as happy as this.	Qatt ma nkun kuntent daqs dan.
So here it is.	Hekk hu hawn.
No one else can do this for you.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jagħmel dan għalik.
No one really knows what to do.	Ħadd ma jaf verament x'għandu jagħmel.
Now, you may think we are ready.	Issa, inti tista 'taħseb li aħna lest.
She really had to go.	Hija verament kellha tmur.
And maybe she did.	U forsi għamlet.
I do that.	Jien nagħmel dan.
Nothing like this happened.	Ma ġara xejn bħal dan.
It wasn't great.	Ma kienx kbir.
But not this.	Imma mhux dan.
That was it.	Li kien.
And it must be so.	U trid tkun hekk.
I'm just a man.	Jien raġel biss.
Forever and ever.	Għal dejjem u dejjem.
Yours must be a problem.	Tiegħek trid tkun problema.
I didn’t really see it.	Ma tantx rajt.
I love being home.	Inħobb inkun id-dar.
Probably not so good.	Probabbilment mhux daqshekk tajjeb.
There was enough time for this later.	Kien hemm żmien biżżejjed għal dan aktar tard.
Not me.	Mhux lili.
Indeed, he did.	Tassew, hekk għamel.
She was pretty now.	Hija kienet pjuttost issa.
No one did.	L-ebda wieħed ma għamel.
I'm not now.	Jien ma issa.
It's hard to know.	Huwa diffiċli li tkun taf.
She wasn’t the only one who had done wrong here.	Ma kinitx l-unika waħda li kienet għamlet ħażin hawn.
It will be great.	Se jkun kbir.
And of course they are.	U ovvjament huma.
She didn’t even need to know.	Lanqas ma kellha bżonn tkun taf.
That's right.	Huwa hekk.
No, not you.	Le, mhux int.
If not, who knows.	Jekk le, min jaf.
I would like to know.	Nixtieq inkun naf.
I don’t want to be there.	Ma rridx inkun hemm.
We both had a great time.	Kemm kellna żmien tajjeb.
But he hadn’t told anyone why.	Imma ma kien qal lil ħadd għaliex.
It wouldn’t be so.	Ma kienx hekk ikun.
It had been a long time not bad.	Kien ilu żmien twil mhux ħażin.
But he hadn't been home in a long time.	Imma kien ilu ma kien id-dar.
No problem, of course.	L-ebda problema, ovvjament.
It does nothing.	Dan ma jagħmel xejn.
Who and more.	Min u aktar.
Who is speaking?	Min qed jitkellem?
It’s not just me who thinks so.	Mhux jien biss li naħseb hekk.
All right.	Kollox tajjeb.
Too much of anything is not good for anyone.	Wisq minn xejn mhu tajjeb għal ħadd.
But we don't.	Imma aħna ma.
There is something here for everyone.	Hemm xi ħaġa hawn għal kulħadd.
It doesn’t have to do that.	M'għandux għalfejn jagħmel dan.
It can work.	Jista 'jaħdem.
He says what he knows.	Jgħid dak li jaf.
This will take a very long time.	Dan se jieħu żmien twil ħafna.
It's done now.	Isir issa.
I went here.	Jien mort hawn.
You are on top of things.	Inti fuq l-affarijiet.
You have to stay.	Trid toqgħod.
Not enough.	Mhux biżżejjed.
And so it will be.	U hekk se jkun.
Where were you? 	Fejn kont?
That's not how it happened.	Hekk mhux kif ġara.
You too.	Int ukoll .
But we don't.	Imma aħna ma.
I have nothing for you.	M'għandi xejn għalik.
Did you come from here?	Ġejt minn hawn?
He is scared.	Huwa jibża.
Nor did it happen.	Lanqas ġara.
It's a long time.	Huwa żmien twil.
This was not going to happen.	Dan ma kienx se jiġri.
This can be seen as follows.	Dan jista 'jidher kif ġej.
Neither is she, really.	Lanqas hi, tassew.
Or rather, it was.	Jew aħjar, kien.
It was his friend, it seemed.	Kien ħabib tiegħu, deher.
I want to hear.	Irrid nisma.
No one can do this for us.	Ħadd ma jista’ jagħmel dan għalina.
That wasn’t enough for me, ever.	Dan ma kienx biżżejjed għalija, qatt.
He's back again.	Huwa lura mill-ġdid.
Maybe that helps.	Forsi dan jgħin.
It's working now.	Issa qed jaħdem.
He should think about it first.	Għandu jaħseb dwarha qabel.
This should not take long.	Dan m'għandux jieħu ħafna żmien.
How it 'comes about'.	Kif 'jiġi dwar'.
In fact, this is wrong.	Fil-fatt, dan huwa ħażin.
He did everything he did right.	Għamel dak kollu li għamel kien tajjeb.
I’m telling you now.	Qed ngħidlek issa.
Maybe he can't see anything.	Forsi ma jista’ jara xejn.
But this is wrong.	Imma dan huwa ħażin.
I see it all.	Nara dan kollu.
I knew it.	Jien kont naf li.
And as well.	U kif ukoll.
I believe you will.	Nemmen li inti se.
That we had to go.	Li kellna mmorru.
He thought we could be friends.	Huwa ħaseb li nistgħu nkunu ħbieb.
You see a little bit, actually.	Tara ftit, fil-fatt.
I see it happening more and more.	Nara li jiġri dejjem aktar.
Enough to see.	Biżżejjed biex jara.
I don’t know how this is going to happen.	Ma nafx kif se jiġri dan.
I don't know.	Ma nafx.
Like any child.	Bħal kull tifel.
It should be more than that.	Għandu jkun aktar minn hekk.
You, boy.	Inti, tifel.
And it was a little.	U kien ftit.
He seemed right about that too.	Deher li kellu raġun dwar dan ukoll.
My first and last and only.	L-ewwel u l-aħħar u l-uniku tiegħi.
That is not enough.	Dan mhux biżżejjed.
Today I went back to school.	Illum mort lura l-iskola.
I don't need your help.	M'għandix bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
I think every man should have one.	Naħseb li kull raġel għandu jkollu wieħed.
She had work in the morning.	Kellha xogħol filgħodu.
And that can be good.	U dan jista 'jkun tajjeb.
He had no lovers.	Ma kellux min iħobb.
Sure enough, it’s here.	Żgur biżżejjed, wasal.
That time has passed.	Dak iż-żmien għadda.
You did so.	Inti għamilt hekk.
You're a good man too not to.	Int raġel tajjeb wisq biex ma.
I knew you wanted to be back.	Kont naf li trid tkun lura.
In fact, he always had.	Fil-fatt, dejjem kellu.
Better not say anything.	Aħjar ma tgħid xejn.
And so, he never came back.	U hekk, hu qatt ma ġie lura.
He is very busy and does not have time for this.	Huwa okkupat ħafna u m'għandux ħin għal dan.
That’s a very good idea.	Dik hija idea tajba ħafna.
And so everything is working fine.	U hekk kollox qed jaħdem tajjeb.
He must be.	Huwa għandu jkun.
They are all here!	Huma kollha hawn!
I know exactly what he was saying.	Naf eżatt x’kien qed jgħid.
He can do it.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel dan.
Is there anyone?	Hemm xi ħadd?
There are times when.	Hemm drabi meta.
There are a lot of people.	Hemm ħafna nies.
This is what we know right now, everyone.	Dan huwa dak li nafu bħalissa, kulħadd.
It was too late to go home.	Kien tard wisq biex tmur id-dar.
He is what he is.	Hu dak li hu.
There are a few of these.	Hemm ftit minn dawn.
And everyone did.	U kulħadd għamel.
But now there was something else.	Imma issa kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
He must be right.	Irid ikollu raġun.
I never thought this would happen.	Qatt ma naħseb li dan se jiġri.
Maybe one day he would try that.	Forsi xi darba kien jipprova hekk.
Same as before.	L-istess bħal qabel.
He thought it was great, too.	Huwa ħaseb li kien kbir, ukoll.
She needed to be alone, she needed time to think.	Hija kellha bżonn tkun waħedha, kellha bżonn iż-żmien biex taħseb.
Still.	Għadu.
She is a good person.	Hija persuna tajba.
Look at what is happening here.	Ħares lejn dak li qed jiġri hawn.
No one can leave until they are ready to eat.	Ħadd ma jista’ jitlaq sakemm ikun lest jiekol.
That was really about it.	Dan kien verament dwar dan.
The only one.	L-uniku.
Someone out there is worried.	Xi ħadd hemm barra huwa inkwetat.
He will not be.	Hu mhux se jkun.
Or you can stay right where you are.	Jew tista' toqgħod eżatt fejn int.
You can't with this.	Inti ma tistax ma 'dan.
Where he went.	Fejn mar.
No one was talking.	Ħadd ma kien qed jitkellem.
That's what you do.	Huwa dak li tagħmel.
Time is money.	Iż-żmien huwa flus.
I go alone.	Immur waħdi.
He obviously had a lot of time to think about things.	Huwa ovvjament kellu ħafna ħin biex jaħseb dwar l-affarijiet.
He is a big boy.	Huwa tifel kbir.
It takes a lot longer.	Huwa jieħu ħafna aktar.
He was mine.	Huwa kien tiegħi.
He was here all this time.	Kien hawn dan iż-żmien kollu.
That would be very bad.	Dan ikun ħażin ħafna.
What will come next ?.	X'se jiġi wara?.
First.	L-ewwel.
I just need to know what it is.	Għandi biss inkun naf x'inhu.
It's pretty easy to see why.	Huwa pjuttost faċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
And it was too late.	U kien għadu tard wisq.
I will not tell you how it was done.	Mhux se ngħidlek kif sar.
Another time, he said.	Xi żmien ieħor, huwa qal.
It takes a little bit of everything.	Tieħu ftit xi ħaġa minn kollox.
I would be happy for anything.	Inkun kuntent għal kull ħaġa.
But no one knew.	Imma ħadd ma kien jaf.
Not quite yet.	Għadha mhux pjuttost.
She wasn’t many people.	Hija ma kinitx ħafna nies.
He had many friends.	Kellu ħafna ħbieb.
Took only once.	Ħa darba biss.
Why do you think this happened?	Għaliex taħseb li ġara dan?
It's fast enough.	Huwa malajr biżżejjed.
It is a very difficult job.	Huwa xogħol diffiċli ħafna.
I never did.	Jien qatt ma għamilt.
And so it was early on.	U hekk kien hemm kmieni.
I did everything.	Jien għamilt dak kollu.
How hard it is to actually tell this to someone else.	Kemm hu diffiċli li fil-fatt tgħid dan lil xi ħadd ieħor.
But that’s not the problem now.	Imma dik mhix il-problema issa.
Or is it wrong.	Jew huwa ħażin.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
It doesn’t.	Dan ma jagħmilx.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
It was a great time.	Kien żmien tajjeb ħafna.
I know it's not good.	Naf li mhux tajjeb.
I’m not sure what the first one is.	M'inix ċert x'inhu l-ewwel wieħed.
We need to know what happened.	Irridu nkunu nafu x’ġara.
You don’t need anything else.	M'għandekx bżonn xi ħaġa oħra.
The work is too little.	Ix-xogħol huwa ftit wisq.
She doesn’t say either.	Hija ma tgħid lanqas.
I think it will be coming later.	Naħseb li se jkun qed jasal aktar tard.
But he needed to.	Imma kellu bżonn.
Definitely not where I thought they were.	Żgur mhux fejn ħsibt li kienu.
We have done this before.	Dan għamilna qabel.
Obviously, everyone wanted to come first.	Ovvjament, kulħadd ried jasal l-ewwel.
Will she be here next week?	Se tkun hawn il-ġimgħa d-dieħla?
But it wasn’t.	Imma ma kienx.
She can't be.	Hija ma tistax tkun.
In fact, it can be so bad.	Fil-fatt, jista 'jkun daqshekk ħażin.
Maybe this is about it.	Forsi dan huwa dwar dan.
There is only one, you see.	Hemm wieħed biss, tara.
Or with me.	Jew miegħi.
I thought there must be something ‘wrong’ with me.	Ħsibt li jrid ikun hemm xi ħaġa 'ħażina' miegħi.
This if often a problem.	Dan jekk ħafna drabi problema.
And you should be, too.	U għandek tkun, ukoll.
Good.	Tajjeb.
He thought of nothing more.	Huwa ħaseb għal xejn aktar.
That seemed to say.	Li deher li tgħid.
Tired.	Għajjien.
Mine is only small.	Tiegħi huwa żgħir biss.
He doesn't talk much.	Huwa ma tantx jitkellem.
They were there before.	Kienu hemm qabel.
I thought it might be yours.	Ħsibt li jista 'jkun tiegħek.
I would be there and.	Inkun hemm u.
I mean, that doesn’t look too good.	Jien ngħid, dan ma jidhirx wisq tajjeb.
If you want.	Jekk trid.
Really, really bad.	Tassew, tassew ħażin.
It wasn't.	Ma kienx.
She had to see for herself.	Kellha tara waħedha.
But it happened.	Imma ġara.
I said something.	għidt xi ħaġa.
That will take a while.	Dak se jieħu ftit.
He was just a boy.	Kien tifel biss.
But that’s not what happened.	Imma dan mhux dak li ġara.
In fact there is.	Fil-fatt hemm.
It's too bad.	Huwa ħażin wisq.
I like to do that.	Jien inħobb nagħmel hekk.
I'm yours, you're mine.	Jien tiegħek, int tiegħi.
From anyone who drives.	Minn kull min isuq.
Worth the work.	Ta’ min ix-xogħol.
For me, they have everything.	Għalija, li għandhom kollox.
Well, there for you.	Ukoll, hemm għalik.
I hope you do the same !.	Nispera li tagħmel l-istess!.
That's not all.	Dan mhux kollox.
There will be few.	Se jkun hemm ftit.
That's what he loved to do.	Dak kien iħobb jagħmel.
I know how this works.	Naf kif dan jaħdem.
It must be tonight.	Irid ikun illejla.
And here's another idea.	U hawn idea oħra.
I was in the room.	Kont fil-kamra.
We really want to do this work.	Irridu tassew li nagħmlu dan ix-xogħol.
Need a little more?	Għandek bżonn ftit aktar?
He didn’t say how.	Ma kienx jgħid kif.
I don’t do that.	Jien ma nagħmel hekk.
I did it before.	Għamilt qabel.
He couldn’t go any further.	Ma setax imur aktar.
He doesn't know what's going on.	Ma jafx x’qed jiġri.
I was there for that.	Jien kont hemm għal dan.
Maybe I did.	Forsi għamilt.
This is now too little, too late.	Dan huwa issa ftit wisq, tard wisq.
Maybe that’s a good thing.	Forsi dik hija ħaġa tajba.
But there was nothing anyone could do.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn xi ħadd li jista 'jagħmel.
It was like.	Kienet bħal.
But not so much.	Imma mhux daqshekk.
Only you can do that for me.	Inti biss tista 'tagħmel dan għalija.
I couldn’t tell.	Ma stajtx ngħid.
That house is too big for just one person.	Dik id-dar hija wisq kbira għal persuna waħda biss.
He looked around.	Huwa ħares madwar.
Not when he was back now.	Mhux meta kien lura issa.
He didn’t want you to know.	Ma riedx li tkun taf.
It didn’t take long.	Ma kienx jieħu ħafna.
I will tell you about this later.	I se ngħidlek dwar dan aktar tard.
It was a long time.	Kien żmien twil.
You can see what you want.	Inti tista 'tara dak li tixtieq.
This may be so.	Dan jista' jkun hekk.
And often it was.	U spiss hekk kien.
You want to tell no one.	Trid tgħid lil ħadd.
I heard it was very good.	Smajt li kien tajjeb ħafna.
After a while he became a man.	Wara xi żmien sar raġel.
I want to get back to you as soon as possible.	Irrid nerġa' lura kemm jista' jkun malajr.
It wasn’t for me.	Ma kienx għalija.
After that, they were together.	Wara dan, kienu flimkien.
And he never had.	U qatt ma kellu.
It looks like we’re going to go.	Jidher li se mmorru.
Need more than anything.	Bżonn aktar minn kull ħaġa.
Something he would never do.	Xi ħaġa li qatt ma kien jagħmel.
There is no other way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor.
This was getting harder and harder.	Dan kien qed isir aktar u aktar diffiċli.
Or so everyone said.	Jew hekk qal kulħadd.
Ask how far it will come.	Staqsa kemm se jasal.
And there are a lot of things about it.	U hemm ħafna affarijiet dwar dan.
More time passed.	Għadda aktar ħin.
We don't have enough money.	M'għandniex biżżejjed flus.
When he plays, he looks pretty tired.	Meta jilgħab, jidher pjuttost għajjien.
He looked at nothing.	Huwa ħares lejn xejn.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx hekk.
You were sitting here and talking.	Inti kont bilqiegħda hawn u titkellem.
Come on, let’s go home.	Ejja, ejja mmorru d-dar.
He just needed a chance.	Huwa biss kellu bżonn ċans.
And say so.	U għid hekk.
I have been for years.	Ilni snin.
Very glad and happy with this.	Ferħan ħafna u kuntent b'dan.
She knew all too well now how they felt.	Hija kienet taf wisq tajjeb issa kif ħassu.
Or whatever you want.	Jew dak li tixtieq.
How long have you been planning this?	Kemm ilu jippjana dan?
And this is good.	U dan huwa tajjeb.
In a few hours.	Fi ftit sigħat.
None of this.	Xejn minn dan.
I made money.	Għamilt flus.
She didn’t know where to go.	Hija ma kinitx taf fejn tmur.
He was waiting.	Kien qed jistenna.
If.	Kieku.
Not how it happens.	Mhux kif jiġri.
More on that later.	Aktar dwar dan aktar tard.
I wish she was still here.	Nixtieq li kienet għadha hawn.
There is no way around this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod madwar dan.
Let’s do something.	Ejja nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
But she was not.	Imma hi ma kinitx.
Come back as soon as possible.	Lura kemm jista 'jkun malajr.
I don’t want to go there.	Ma rridx immur hemm.
You don’t have to eat much.	M'għandekx għalfejn tiekol ħafna.
But not over and over and over.	Imma mhux aktar u aktar u aktar.
He sat down and looked.	Poġġa bilqiegħda u ħares.
But first things first.	Imma l-ewwel affarijiet l-ewwel.
The whole house is yours.	Id-dar kollha hi tiegħek.
She is better than me.	Hija aħjar minni.
This is my home right now.	Din hija d-dar tiegħi bħalissa.
Look around for something.	Ħares madwar għal xi ħaġa.
I almost didn’t.	Jien kważi ma kontx.
She had done more.	Kienet għamlet aktar.
She was a person.	Kienet persuna.
He didn't stand a chance.	Ma kellux ċans.
If it’s not one thing, it’s another.	Jekk mhix ħaġa waħda, hija oħra.
I'm fine being.	Jien tajjeb qed.
We don't.	Aħna ma.
There is no such thing as easy work.	M'hemm l-ebda ħaġa bħal xogħol faċli.
I'm really tired today.	Jien tassew għajjien illum.
But in !!!.	Imma fi !!!.
You know more than they do.	Int taf aktar milli huma.
That would be a great thing.	Dik tkun ħaġa kbira.
But he couldn't think of anything to say.	Imma ma setax jaħseb xi ħaġa xi jgħid.
Kellek.	Kellek.
She was here before.	Kienet hawn qabel.
That's here.	Dak hawn.
Nobody knows.	Ħadd ma jaf.
Maybe nothing had happened.	Forsi xejn ma kien ġara.
He is a bad man.	Huwa raġel ħażin.
It’s just the truth.	Hija biss il-verità.
It was a good one.	Kienet waħda tajba.
I look forward to a good year for him.	Nistenna sena tajba għalih.
It just took a lot of work.	Huwa ħa biss ħafna xogħol.
You go with him.	Inti tmur miegħu.
By that time it was already too late.	Sa dak iż-żmien kien diġà tard wisq.
I know a man, actually.	Naf raġel, fil-fatt.
All you have to do is stay there.	Kull ma trid tagħmel hu li toqgħod hemm.
Our work is not finished.	Ix-xogħol tagħna mhux lest.
I will definitely do more soon.	Żgur li nagħmel aktar minn hekk dalwaqt.
You will think of something.	Inti ser taħseb xi ħaġa.
I don't want to.	Ma rridx.
That's exactly what happened.	Hekk ġara eżatt.
You are one.	Inti wieħed.
It was too early for that.	Kien kmieni wisq għal dan.
We had a great time.	Kellna ħafna ħin.
It can be very helpful for us.	Jista’ jkun ta’ għajnuna kbira għalina.
He wanted to know why.	Ried ikun jaf għaliex.
They were friends.	Kienu ħbieb.
It's too hard.	Huwa diffiċli wisq.
Everyone knows now.	Kulħadd jaf issa.
It’s really, really great.	Huwa tassew, tassew kbir.
A long time ago now.	Żmien twil ilu issa.
But no one wants that.	Imma ħadd ma jrid hekk.
If he wants to talk, he can go first.	Jekk irid jitkellem, jista’ jmur l-ewwel.
I don’t want you to do anything for me.	Ma rrid li tagħmel xejn għalija.
Where do you want to go?	Fejn trid tmur?
It's easy to do.	Huwa faċli li tagħmel.
I love the dog too.	Jien inħobb il-kelb ukoll.
I can’t believe she did this to me.	Ma nistax nemmen li għamlet dan miegħi.
He was only right about one thing.	Huwa kellu raġun biss dwar ħaġa waħda.
I'm really happy.	Jien tassew kuntent.
It was the same with me.	Kien l-istess miegħi.
A little over a year ago he was here.	Ftit aktar minn sena kien ilu hawn.
It's not much.	Mhuwiex ħafna.
You still are.	Għadek int.
I had this.	Kelli dan.
Not everything, probably.	Mhux kollox, probabbilment.
You can't talk to him.	Ma tistax titkellem miegħu.
I'm sure you can do that.	Jien ċert li tista 'tagħmel dan.
I’ve never done this before ever.	Qatt ma għamilt dan qabel qatt.
This was better for me.	Dan kien għalija aħjar.
He has done this before.	Huwa għamel dan qabel.
Time alone says.	Iż-żmien biss jgħid.
I was definitely a happy boy.	Żgur li kont tifel ferħan.
He didn't have long to wait.	Ma kellux twil jistenna.
He never does.	Qatt ma jagħmel.
You had to worry there.	Kellek inkwetat hemm.
It's too small.	Huwa żgħir wisq.
I thought we had.	Ħsibt li kellna.
Well it's ready.	Ukoll huwa lest.
Just sitting around.	Biss bilqiegħda madwar.
No, not quite.	Le, mhux pjuttost.
Every time he had a chance, he took it.	Kull darba li kellu ċans, ħa.
I don’t have to try so hard, which is good for me.	M'għandix għalfejn nipprova daqshekk, li huwa tajjeb għalija.
I’ve been wrong since it happened.	Jien kont ħażin minn meta ġara.
There would be time for that.	Ikun hemm żmien għal dak.
And there may be.	U jista 'jkun hemm.
Like so much.	Bħal tant.
There I am, and there you are.	Hemm jien, u hemm int.
I'm sure it is.	Jien ċert li huwa.
You went too far.	Inti mort wisq.
Nor are they what you seem to see.	Lanqas huma dak li jidher li tara.
It was for me.	Kien għalija.
I didn’t tell anyone.	Jien ma għedt lil ħadd.
It has never been long enough.	Hija qatt ma kienet għal żmien twil biżżejjed.
I can be more, I can be better.	Nista' nkun aktar, inkun aħjar.
Usually not much.	Normalment mhux ħafna.
He did so.	Huwa għamel hekk.
How long are you?	Kemm int twil?
Why, she didn't know.	Għaliex, hija ma kinitx taf.
They are not likely to do more.	Mhux probabbli li qed jagħmlu aktar.
I have a little bit of everything.	Għandi ftit minn kollox.
She was beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa.
My will not be.	Tiegħi mhux se jkun.
I could never understand how I did it.	Qatt ma stajt nifhem kif għamilt.
To see.	Biex tara.
Not even who I was.	Lanqas min kont.
She knew what was going on.	Kienet taf x’kien hemm.
I can't talk to him.	Ma nistax nitkellem miegħu.
Anyone can be great.	Kulħadd jista 'jkun kbir.
Am I me? 	Jien jien?
But not only that.	Imma mhux dan biss.
I’m not telling anyone who you are.	Jien ma ngħid lil ħadd min int.
I know, but.	Naf, imma.
And he was just sitting there.	U kien biss bilqiegħda hemm.
Maybe so.	Forsi hekk.
And you too, my friend.	U int ukoll, ħabib tiegħi.
That I never saw.	Li qatt ma rajt.
Everyone seemed glad to see each other.	Kulħadd deher ferħan jara lil xulxin.
If only he could see.	Kieku seta' jara biss.
No one wanted to do that.	Ħadd ma ried jagħmel hekk.
Kelli.	Kelli.
But it wasn’t small.	Imma ma kienx żgħir.
Everyone needs help.	Kulħadd għandu bżonn l-għajnuna.
No, he wasn't going to.	Le, ma kienx se.
He knew what he was doing.	Kien jaf x’kien qed jagħmel.
I had to be something more.	Kelli nkun xi ħaġa aktar.
What it was, is better.	Dak li kien, huwa aħjar.
There, now you know.	Hemm, issa taf.
You can do many things.	Tista 'tagħmel ħafna affarijiet.
I don’t want anyone to know.	Ma rrid li ħadd ikun jaf.
Better late than never.	Aħjar tard milli qatt.
There were times when she didn’t know where she was.	Kien hemm drabi li ma kinitx taf fejn kienet.
It was not there.	Ma kienx hemm.
Other people have problems.	Nies oħra għandhom problemi.
He was interested in almost everything.	Kien interessat fi kważi kollox.
But that was not it.	Imma ma kienx dan.
But he never speaks.	Imma qatt ma titkellem.
Come now, come now.	Ejja issa, ejja issa.
I have friends.	Għandi ħbieb.
With someone else.	Ma' xi ħadd ieħor.
No one said anything good.	Ħadd ma qal xejn tajjeb.
You don't need to know.	M'għandekx bżonn tkun taf.
You are a great person.	Inti persuna kbira.
I saw and I saw.	Rajt u rajt.
He has.	Huwa jkollu.
Well, that wasn’t going to happen, of course.	Ukoll, dan ma kienx se jiġri, ovvjament.
But even that will not be enough.	Imma lanqas dan mhux se jkun biżżejjed.
You can do this again.	Tista 'tagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
This is just one.	Din hija waħda biss.
You either do it or you don’t.	Inti jew tagħmel dan jew ma tagħmilx.
He shouldn't have been here.	Ma kellux ikun hawn.
All you need to do is look.	Kull ma trid tagħmel hu li tidher.
He had to do it.	Huwa kellu jagħmel dan.
It seems easy.	Jidher faċli.
She does too.	Hija tagħmel ukoll.
I wanted to be good to him.	Ridt tkun tajba miegħu.
This told me over and over again.	Dan qalli darba u oħra.
And maybe not.	U forsi le.
There is something here.	Hemm xi ħaġa hawn.
That was no problem.	Dik ma kienet l-ebda problema.
In fact, it's really good.	Fil-fatt, tassew tajjeb.
I know very little about such things.	Naf ftit li xejn dwar affarijiet bħal dawn.
So always said everyone.	Hekk dejjem qal kulħadd.
The only thing is.	L-unika ħaġa hi.
Or someone else.	Jew xi ħadd ieħor.
Or something goes wrong.	Jew xi ħaġa tmur ħażin.
There is something good out there.	Hemm xi ħaġa tajba hemmhekk.
You can either do it or you can’t.	Tista' jew tagħmel dan jew ma tistax.
I wanted something more.	Ridt xi ħaġa aktar.
I hope there is nothing wrong.	Nispera li m'hemm xejn ħażin.
I did so as well.	Jien għamilt hekk ukoll.
I would.	Nixtieq.
And you’re not the same man, either.	U m'intix l-istess raġel, lanqas.
Quite actually.	Pjuttost fil-fatt.
I had little time to see anything else.	Kelli ftit ħin biex tara xi ħaġa oħra.
Had this happened a few hours ago.	Kieku dan ġara ftit sigħat ilu.
Well, there is nothing like it.	Ukoll, m'hemm xejn bħal dan.
You want to know where she is.	Trid tkun taf fejn hi.
I can take it home now.	Nista’ nieħu d-dar issa.
You have to do a little.	Trid tagħmel xi ftit.
He should have a car of course.	Għandu jkollu karozza ovvjament.
That would be enough, probably.	Ikun biżżejjed, x'aktarx.
She was no longer there.	Ma kinitx għadha hemm.
No she is not.	Le hi mhix.
It was more than enough for us.	Kien aktar minn biżżejjed għalina.
I didn’t do anything there.	Jien ma għamilt xejn hemmhekk.
He should be back by now.	Huwa għandu jkun lura sa issa.
You are better than this.	Inti aħjar minn dan.
Not so much.	Mhux daqshekk.
That's something.	Dik xi ħaġa.
But you can't.	Imma ma tistax.
He came out.	Ħareġ.
It’s not just talking about here.	Mhuwiex biss jitkellem madwar hawn.
Everything is going faster.	Kollox sejjer aktar malajr.
You can do this ahead of time.	Tista 'tagħmel dan qabel iż-żmien.
Same with me.	L-istess miegħi.
All good.	Dak kollu tajjeb.
Where he knew she was.	Fejn kien jaf li kienet.
No he is not.	Le hu mhux.
It was a little early.	Kien hemm ftit kmieni.
I like to tell the truth.	Inħobb ngħid il-verità.
It can’t be too bad.	Ma jistax ikun ħażin wisq.
There was a chance.	Kien hemm ċans.
It will not happen.	Mhux se jiġri.
Now this is not a bad idea.	Issa din mhix idea ħażina.
But nothing was there.	Imma xejn ma kien hemm.
Now, we do.	Issa, nagħmlu.
What was happening was something else.	Kien x’kien qed jiġri kien xi ħaġa aktar.
I can't do that.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan.
I was glad he was doing this and not me.	Kont ferħan li qed jagħmel dan u mhux jien.
Very good person.	Persuna tajba ħafna.
I'm very sorry, but.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna, imma .
Or you don’t have one.	Jew m'għandekx waħda.
When you get back home, now.	Meta tmur lura d-dar, issa.
Maybe it wasn't.	Forsi ma kienx.
That's about it.	Dak huwa dwar.
We are one thing.	Aħna ħaġa waħda.
We had a little something about it.	Kellna ftit xi ħaġa dwarha.
I’m pretty sure it was him.	Jien pjuttost ċert li kien hu.
You have to think too much.	Trid taħseb wisq.
There are no problems.	M'hemm l-ebda problemi.
I’ve been able to do more, supposedly.	Jien stajt nagħmel aktar, suppost.
I just hope he can make a lot of money before long.	Nittama biss li jista 'jagħmel ħafna flus qabel twil.
Not easy.	Mhux faċli.
Like, really early.	Bħal, tassew kmieni.
She was as beautiful as ever.	Kienet sabiħa daqs qatt qabel.
Glad you came.	Kuntent li ġejt.
You can't do things.	Ma tistax tagħmel affarijiet.
One and ready.	Wieħed u lest.
This is now certain.	Dan issa huwa ċert.
This should be great.	Dan għandu jkun kbir.
It doesn't have to be this way.	M'għandux ikun hekk.
But obviously there was no time for that.	Imma ovvjament ma kienx hemm ħin għal dan.
I didn’t know where he was.	Ma kontx naf fejn kien.
That would have been a good one.	Dik kienet tkun waħda tajba.
Now I try to do that.	Issa nipprova nagħmel dan.
Just isn’t happening.	Biss mhux qed jiġri.
John sees this.	John jara dan.
He could have been.	Huwa seta 'kien.
Well, good enough.	Ukoll, tajjeb biżżejjed.
Easy to do.	Faċli tagħmel dan.
The only problem is how to do it.	L-unika problema hija kif tagħmel dan.
I have been doing this.	Ilni nagħmel dan.
He agreed to be there.	Huwa qabel li jkun hemm.
After that, it doesn’t.	Wara dan, ma jagħmilx hekk.
How do I do that.	Kif nista nagħmel dan.
I was ready for.	I kien lest għal.
Not really interested in going with another person either.	Mhux verament interessat li jmur ma' persuna oħra lanqas.
I don’t think you want to go home !.	Ma naħsibx li trid tmur id-dar!.
No one lived there.	Ħadd ma kien jgħix hemm.
I think he is, a little.	Naħseb li hu, ftit.
I need to be with you.	Għandi bżonn inkun miegħek.
I think it’s just great.	Naħseb li huwa biss kbir.
Here it is.	Hawn hi.
That’s really good, of course.	Dak tassew tajjeb, ovvjament.
He just came out.	Huwa biss ħareġ.
Who was it.	Min kien.
It would have been difficult.	Kien ikun diffiċli.
I can tell you whatever.	Nista’ ngħidlek tkun xi tkun.
You want to know that.	Trid tkun taf li.
Where did he go?	Fejn mar?
Still.	Għadu.
It was happening.	Kien qed jiġri.
There we were and they are.	Kien hemm aħna u huma.
It's not so much.	Mhuwiex daqshekk.
Maybe it would.	Forsi kieku.
Obviously, he knew where they were.	Ovvjament, kien jaf fejn kienu.
I will be back to you within a few hours.	Inkun lura għandek fi żmien ftit sigħat.
Not like anything else out there.	Mhux bħal xi ħaġa oħra hemmhekk.
This cannot be.	Dan ma jistax ikun.
Like you don’t want to be here.	Bħal ma tridx tkun hawn.
I think that’s a bad thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa ħażina.
Definitely not supposed to be.	Żgur li ma kellux jiġi.
One, where are you.	Wieħed, fejn int.
Such a thing is a very bad idea.	Ħaġa bħal din hija idea ħażina ħafna.
Whether you are.	Kemm jekk int.
This book may not be for you.	Dan il-ktieb jista’ ma jkunx għalik.
It's been so long.	Kien ilu tant.
Plus, you'll be getting rid of clutter you don't need.	Barra minn hekk, tkun trid.
She had to see.	Hi kellha tara.
I am so happy to do this work.	Jiena tant kuntent li nagħmel dan ix-xogħol.
Just the same.	Biss l-istess.
If she had, she would have and she wouldn't be there.	Kieku kellu, kien ikollu u hi ma tkunx hemm.
He once told me it would not be a problem.	Huwa qalli darba ma tkunx problema.
Everything will be fine now.	Kollox issa jkun tajjeb.
And you're late.	U int tard.
And be with you.	U tkun miegħek.
The school was not the same.	L-iskola ma kinitx l-istess.
He was sure he had seen this before.	Kien ċert li kien ra dan qabel.
Now, enough is enough.	Issa, biżżejjed huwa biżżejjed.
Good or bad.	Tajjeb jew ħażin.
Nothing went wrong.	Xejn mar ħażin.
You don’t do what you say.	Ma tagħmilx dak li tgħid.
I don’t know if it was or not.	Ma nafx jekk kienx jew le.
I’ll have to see this to believe it.	Jien ser ikolli nara dan biex nemmen.
He wants to eat with you too.	Irid jiekol miegħek ukoll.
There is a problem.	Hemm problema.
In fact, look at this.	Fil-fatt, ħares lejn dan.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
I don’t know by whom.	Ma nafx minn min.
I’m sure I will try this.	Jien żgur li se nipprova dan.
But there is more.	Imma hemm aktar.
I don’t want to go.	Ma rridx immur.
It came from outside.	Ġie minn barra.
I didn’t know that, either.	Jien ma kontx naf li, lanqas.
Not much more.	Mhux wisq aktar.
That’s so hard.	Dak hu tant diffiċli.
But so nothing happened.	Imma hekk ma ġara xejn.
Here it is.	Hawn hi.
And home.	U d-dar.
I really think something is wrong.	Verament naħseb xi ħaġa ħażina.
I don’t know what that would be.	Ma nafx dak li jkun.
So far everything is working fine.	Sa issa kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
Minix.	Minix.
And we have.	U għandna.
She knew better now.	Hija kienet taf aħjar issa.
I don’t do a thing like that.	Jien ma nagħmel ħaġa bħal dik.
You never will.	Inti qatt mhu se.
But she never comes.	Imma hi qatt ma tiġi.
I want to do more than that.	Nixtieq nagħmel aktar minn hekk.
But only you can do that.	Imma int biss tista’ tagħmel dan.
I can’t wait to see this.	Ma nistax nistenna biex nara dan.
Not if you don’t want to.	Mhux jekk ma tridx.
We’ve never been here before.	Qatt ma konna hawn qabel.
The house too.	Id-dar ukoll.
More is not always better.	Aktar mhux dejjem aħjar.
In fact, this is not enough.	Fil-fatt, dan mhux biżżejjed.
I would be late.	inkun tard.
I'm sorry to say that.	Jiddispjaċini ngħid hekk.
He returned three hours later.	Ġie lura tliet sigħat wara.
He never had.	Hu qatt ma kellu.
But he couldn’t do it.	Imma ma setax jagħmel dan.
From this he was sure.	Minn dan kien ċert.
Sitting too long right now.	Bilqiegħda twil wisq bħalissa.
I was, really.	Jien kont, tassew.
You did so.	Inti għamilt hekk.
Come on.	Ġej.
Can't see what's going on here?	Ma tistax tara x'qed jiġri hawn?
It was so fast.	Kien daqshekk malajr.
But it wasn’t there.	Imma ma kienx hemm.
I didn’t know about it.	Ma kontx naf dwar dan.
I had never seen anything like it.	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa bħal din.
You know, they’re doing a lot of things right now.	Taf, qed jagħmlu ħafna affarijiet bħalissa.
Most people find it difficult.	Ħafna nies huwa diffiċli.
But it wasn’t a car.	Imma ma kinitx karozza.
I say what I want to say.	Ngħid dak li rrid ngħid.
He was probably right.	Probabbilment kellu raġun.
I hadn’t seen anyone play like that.	Ma kont rajt lil ħadd jilgħab hekk.
Everything would be better.	Kollox ikun aħjar.
But he couldn't, not yet.	Imma ma setax, għadu mhux.
It's never easy.	Qatt mhu faċli.
That he wanted to live again.	Li ried jerġa jgħix.
I’ve never done that, and never will.	Qatt ma għamilt hekk, u qatt mhu se.
Maybe it wasn't.	Forsi ma kinitx.
I have to tell you again.	Għandi nerġa' ngħidlek.
But if she doesn't.	Imma jekk hi ma.
I'm not there right now.	Jien mhux hemm bħalissa.
It was so good.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb.
This is out.	Dan huwa barra.
That was good and bad.	Dak kien tajjeb u ħażin.
I have no idea who you are.	M'għandi l-ebda idea min int.
And it just started from there.	U beda biss minn hemm.
After the first time is easy.	Wara l-ewwel darba huwa faċli.
Come home early.	Ejja d-dar kmieni.
This is the same with us.	Dan huwa l-istess magħna.
But no, not before.	Imma le, mhux qabel.
Things are a lot easier now.	L-affarijiet huma ħafna aktar faċli issa.
But it was good now.	Imma kien tajjeb issa.
I don’t know what will happen tomorrow.	Ma nafx x'se jiġri għada.
No one is ready to talk.	Ħadd mhu lest li jitkellem.
This is for you.	Din hija għalik.
He told me he wasn’t going to be home for a while.	Huwa qalli li ma kienx se jkun id-dar għal xi żmien.
She probably had.	Probabbilment kellha.
I won't be late.	Jien mhux ser inkun tard.
I can say that.	Nista 'ngħid daqshekk.
Nobody wanted to know anything.	Ħadd ma ried ikun jaf xejn.
And not only that.	U mhux hekk biss.
You only have one chance.	Għandek ċans wieħed biss.
Here's how.	Hawn mod.
She needed to be.	Hija kellha bżonn tkun.
I'm still hearing about it.	Għadni nisma’ dwarha.
She did a great job.	Hija għamlet xogħol kbir.
I can’t be sure.	Ma nistax inkun ċert.
I don’t think it’s good.	Ma naħsibx li huwa tajjeb.
More on it if you need any help.	Aktar dwarha jekk għandek bżonn xi għajnuna.
Everyone was thinking the same thing.	Kulħadd kien qed jaħseb l-istess.
I didn’t even know it was coming.	Lanqas kont naf li kien ġej.
It was easier.	Kien aktar faċli.
It was good but it could have been better.	Kien tajjeb imma seta’ kien aħjar.
Definitely not here.	Żgur li ma kienx hawn.
Everyone is.	Kulħadd hu.
When they felt better it was enough time.	Meta ħassu aħjar kien żmien biżżejjed.
It doesn’t have to be much.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun ħafna.
It should be.	Għandu jkun.
Now you can.	Issa tista'.
He's not worried.	Hu mhux inkwetat.
Definitely not.	Żgur li mhux.
It didn't look like much.	Ma tantx deher.
Needless to say.	M’għandux għalfejn jgħid aktar.
I’ve never seen anything like that.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal dik.
Why should you.	Għaliex għandek.
But he couldn't, not yet.	Imma ma setax, għadu mhux.
Nobody knows.	Ħadd ma jaf.
Everything is not as it seems.	Kollox mhux kif jidher.
It's not hard to do that.	Mhuwiex diffiċli li tagħmel dan.
Really, there is.	Tassew, hemm.
I doubt he will come back.	Niddubita li se jiġi lura.
He was a teacher.	Kien għalliem.
Everyone already knows you have to do this.	Kulħadd diġà jaf li għandek tagħmel dan.
Whoever gets there first wins.	Min jasal hemm l-ewwel jirbaħ.
But here comes much more.	Imma hawn jiġi ħafna aktar.
And another around him.	U ieħor madwar tiegħu.
Once was enough.	Darba kienet biżżejjed.
He would do that.	Kieku jagħmel dan.
If they are, great.	Jekk huma, kbir.
It comes from behind.	Jiġi minn wara.
It’s too big for me.	Huwa wisq kbir għalija.
She should have known that.	Hija kellha tkun taf li.
I probably should.	I probabbilment għandhom.
But no people.	Imma l-ebda nies.
It was the book he wanted.	Kien il-ktieb li kien ried.
I want you to do that.	Nixtieq li inti tagħmel dan.
I go back some years, of course.	Jien immur lura xi snin, ovvjament.
I’m really glad I was able to do that.	Jien tassew ferħan li kont kapaċi tagħmel dan.
If you say so.	Jekk tgħid hekk.
This is still great.	Dan għadu kbir.
But one thing seems likely.	Imma ħaġa waħda tidher probabbli.
She always has been.	Hija dejjem kienet.
Or not me.	Jew le minni.
We have everything.	Għandna kollox.
A man is really good.	Raġel huwa tassew tajjeb.
He was from that now.	Huwa kien minn dak issa.
It didn't look right.	Ma deherx tajjeb.
I have to do what is needed.	Ikolli nagħmel dak li hemm bżonn.
I hope it was helpful.	Nittama li kien ta' xi għajnuna.
She is not so beautiful.	Hija mhix daqshekk sabiħa.
So far so good.	Sa hawn ukoll.
It wasn’t that big.	Ma kienx daqshekk kbir.
It was so much to take.	Kien tant li tieħu.
It was a great idea.	Kienet idea kbira.
And you know it.	U taf dan.
I didn’t know how.	Ma kontx naf kif.
That’s almost everything anyone has ever told me.	Dak hu kważi dak kollu li qatt qalli xi ħadd.
Everyone was scared of.	Kulħadd kien jibża 'minn.
And we know you don’t have that.	U nafu li inti m'għandekx dak.
And he didn’t even have to think about it.	U dan lanqas ma kellu jaħseb.
My work is finished now.	Ix-xogħol tiegħi huwa lest issa.
And of course it was.	U ovvjament kien.
I’m going to do that now.	Immur nagħmel hekk issa.
He was sure he wouldn’t.	Kien ċert li ma kienx se.
But there has to be something.	Imma jrid ikun hemm xi ħaġa.
It could be because it’s your last chance.	Jista 'jkun għaliex huwa l-aħħar ċans tiegħek.
There wasn’t much to say.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna xi tgħid.
And we will be back.	U se nkunu lura.
Something to think about.	Xi ħaġa biex taħseb.
It sure is.	Huwa żgur.
At that time, there was no one	Dak iż-żmien, ma kien hemm ħadd
And of course they do.	U ovvjament jagħmlu.
You have to do everything you can.	Għandek tagħmel dak kollu li tista '.
No one ever thought this was going to happen.	Ħadd qatt ma ħaseb li dan kien se jiġri.
And you have to do it.	U inti għandek tagħmel dan.
No to each one.	Le lil kull wieħed.
It's not happening, it can never really happen.	Mhux qed jiġri, qatt ma jista’ jiġri tassew.
You know what's going on, you know what's right and what's wrong.	Taf hemm lura, taf x’inhu tajjeb u x’inhu ħażin.
I never told this to anyone.	Qatt ma għidt dan lil ħadd.
It was never.	Kien qatt.
If it weren’t for you, it would have been someone else.	Kieku ma kontx int, kien ikun xi ħadd ieħor.
Just not so fast.	Biss mhux daqshekk malajr.
He was good to me.	Kien tajjeb miegħi.
It won’t be long, it can’t be long.	Mhux se jkun twil, ma jistax ikun twil.
I don’t know enough with him to have one.	Jien ma nafx biżżejjed miegħu biex ikolli wieħed.
I know you are.	Naf li int.
I have a job now.	Għandi xogħol issa.
And things like that.	U affarijiet bħal dawn.
I'm here now.	Jien hawn issa.
It seems only one way.	Jidher mod wieħed biss.
We were first on.	Konna l-ewwel fuq.
And she knew how it could be otherwise.	U kienet taf kif seta’ jkun mod ieħor.
It's for me.	Huwa għalija.
So it was.	Hekk kien kien.
Everything was done too much for him.	Kollox sar wisq għalih.
He will do nothing with us.	Mhu se jagħmel xejn magħna.
Why, why, why.	Għaliex, għaliex, għaliex.
I'll think about it.	Jien ser naħseb dwarha.
I think it should be helpful for us.	Naħseb li għandu jkun ta' għajnuna għalina.
This will be no problem for me.	Din se tkun l-ebda problema għalija.
But there is a problem.	Imma hemm problema.
He wanted to.	Ried.
I do.	Jien.
Nothing she did seemed right.	Xejn li għamlet deher li kien tajjeb.
This is not what it is for me.	Dan mhuwiex dak li huwa għalija.
Well, my friend there.	Ukoll, ħabib tiegħi hemmhekk.
I was there too.	Jien kont hemm ukoll.
No, not yet.	Le, għadu mhux biss.
No one can take that from me.	Ħadd ma jista’ jieħu dak minni.
He wanted to live there.	Ried jgħix hemm.
Time is not money.	Iż-żmien mhux flus.
I think he is right.	Naħseb li għandu raġun.
He was that tired.	Kien dak għajjien.
I wonder about that.	Nistaqsi dwar dan.
It's really not like anything else.	Huwa verament mhux bħal xi ħaġa oħra.
It was where she was.	Kienet fejn kienet.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Nispera li kulħadd sejjer tajjeb.
Me too.	Jien ukoll.
Lots of time.	Ħafna ħin.
He didn't do that.	Ma kienx jagħmel hekk.
And up to nothing good.	U sa xejn tajjeb.
I came here to talk to you.	Ġejt hawn biex nitkellem miegħek.
Just do your job.	Tagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħek biss.
She knew it wasn’t going to be.	Kienet taf li ma kienx se jkun.
Now everything is working properly.	Issa kollox qed jaħdem kif suppost.
I'm as happy as we are.	Jien kuntent kif aħna.
I don’t think about it.	Ma naħsibx dwarha.
We can do one this afternoon.	Nistgħu nagħmlu waħda llum wara nofsinhar.
I know a lot about it, but definitely not everything.	Naf ħafna dwarha, imma żgur mhux kollox.
Now everyone has one.	Issa kulħadd għandu wieħed.
She had to say more.	Kellha tgħid aktar.
She wouldn’t want to know that.	Hi ma tkunx tixtieq li tkun taf dan.
It happened there.	Hemmhekk ġara.
But you can't be sure.	Imma ma tistax tkun ċert.
And on the back, after both of them.	U fuq wara, wara t-tnejn li huma.
No, never again.	Le, qatt aktar.
That’s just the first.	Dik hija biss l-ewwel.
And on and on.	U fuq u fuq.
I never wanted anything else.	Qatt ma ridt xi ħaġa oħra.
Only one person did this.	Persuna waħda biss għamlet dan.
I expect it to be ready by now.	Nistenna li huwa lest sa issa.
First be an idea of ​​where to go.	L-ewwel tkun idea fejn tmur.
It was not so.	Ma kienx hekk.
He had very much wanted to go.	Huwa kien ried ħafna li jmur.
Not even here.	Lanqas hawn.
Come on.	Ġej.
Or I saw someone else altogether.	Jew rajt lil xi ħadd ieħor għal kollox.
We don't, of course.	Aħna ma, ovvjament.
He says he wants to leave.	Jgħid li jrid jitlaq.
From us.	Minn konna.
I think it won't.	Naħseb li mhux se.
I believe he will win.	Nemmen li se jirbaħ.
I really want this.	Irrid ħafna dan.
I hope the same.	Nispera li l-istess.
It could be tomorrow.	Jista’ jkun għada.
This works very well.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
You don't.	Inti ma.
I’m sure you are too.	Jien ċert li int ukoll.
They were out together for three hours.	Kienu barra flimkien tliet sigħat.
No, it's not the same.	Le, ma jkunx l-istess.
This actually happened.	Dan fil-fatt ġara.
But he left.	Imma telaq.
But nothing happens.	Imma ma jiġri xejn.
You're a great man.	Int raġel kbir.
A lot has happened.	Ġara ħafna.
I couldn't wait any longer.	Ma kontx nistenna aktar.
I was just tired.	Kont għajjien biss.
And that is perhaps why it is so difficult.	U dan huwa forsi għaliex huwa daqshekk diffiċli.
Most do not.	Ħafna ma.
I don’t think you have, you know.	Ma naħsibx li għandek, taf.
It’s too early to tell.	Għadu kmieni wisq biex tgħid.
It’s more for us.	Huwa aktar għalina.
I couldn't say for sure.	Ma stajtx ngħid żgur.
But he is not.	Imma hu mhux hekk.
I’m really glad we did.	Jien tassew kuntent li għamilna.
You can't say no.	Ma tistax tgħid le.
It is usually busy.	Normalment ikun okkupat.
Nothing came out.	Ma ħareġ xejn.
I don't know how.	Ma nafx kif.
Everything has to be ready.	Kollox irid ikun lest.
I don’t want to do this anymore.	Ma rridx nagħmel dan aktar.
He’s not a bad boy to talk to.	Mhuwiex tifel ħażin biex jitkellem miegħu.
I believe.	Jien nemmen.
How were you.	Kif kont int.
A much better idea.	Idea ħafna aħjar.
Don't be.	Tkunx.
You would have been there.	Inti kieku kont hemm.
It's not great.	Mhuwiex kbir.
But there is no one here.	Imma m'hemm ħadd hawn.
Or, if he did, he did nothing about it.	Jew, jekk għamel, ma għamel xejn dwar dan.
Can anyone please help.	Jista' xi ħadd jekk jogħġbok jgħin.
You know, she looks pretty tired.	Taf, tidher pjuttost għajjien.
But that was great if.	Imma dak kien kbir jekk.
I don’t know how this will work.	Ma nafx kif dan se jaħdem.
Nobody is.	Ħadd mhu.
And he would be right.	U kien ikollu raġun.
This must be difficult.	Dan għandu jkun diffiċli.
This is where everything went wrong again.	Dan huwa fejn kollox mar ħażin mill-ġdid.
He hadn’t done wrong.	Huwa ma kienx għamel ħażin.
I need your help here.	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek hawn.
In no time you will.	Fi ftit ħin int ser.
He never saw anything.	Qatt ma ra xejn.
I like to think so.	Jien inħobb naħseb hekk.
I don't need any.	M'għandi bżonn l-ebda.
He is not one.	Hu mhux wieħed.
It couldn’t take for much longer.	Ma setax jieħu għal ħafna aktar żmien.
I just need a little more time.	Għandi bżonn biss ftit aktar ħin.
But it must be.	Imma għandu jkun.
He seemed to want to be there.	Deher li jrid ikun hemm.
Glad you are having fun.	Ferħan li qed tieħu gost.
I can't even speak.	Lanqas nista’ nitkellem.
Most everyone had.	Ħafna kulħadd kellu.
From there.	Minn hemm.
There is the door.	Hemm il-bieb.
He saw me.	Huwa ra lili.
Fear for me.	Jibża għalija.
I was quite surprised.	Kont pjuttost sorpriż.
I never thought it would be you.	Qatt ma ħsibt li tkun int.
Tired.	Għajjien.
I know what you are doing.	Naf x'qed tagħmel.
I don’t want to see anyone.	Ma rrid nara lil ħadd.
In fact he had died there.	Fil-fatt kien miet hemmhekk.
This book will make back to school fun.	Dan il-ktieb se jagħmel lura l-iskola gost.
It won’t be long now.	Mhux se jkun twil issa.
Surely that was something.	Żgur li din kienet xi ħaġa.
They really don't.	Huma verament ma.
There is probably more.	Probabbilment hemm aktar.
I think it was never there.	Naħseb li qatt ma kien hemm.
It's really not hard to do.	Huwa verament mhux diffiċli li tagħmel.
That was him.	Dan kien hu.
This is not so.	Dan mhux hekk.
Everything was fine.	Kollox kien tajjeb.
That started right there.	Li beda eżatt hemmhekk.
I'm for a long time.	Jien għal żmien twil.
I should never see you again.	Qatt m'għandi nara aktar.
Now we knew we were right.	Issa konna nafu li kellna raġun.
It is very difficult for me to do that.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna għalija li nagħmel dan.
This was not who she was.	Din ma kinitx min kienet.
Everyone agreed on this.	Kulħadd qabel dwar dan.
And not too much.	U mhux wisq.
Maybe a little earlier.	Forsi ftit qabel.
I’ve been able to do that.	Jien stajt nagħmel dan.
I didn’t want to do my homework.	Ma ridtx nagħmel id-dar tiegħi.
I know what you are thinking.	Naf x'qed taħseb.
This is not very good.	Dan mhux tajjeb ħafna.
Let's go there.	Ejja mmorru hemm.
That she knew.	Dan kienet taf.
I’ll tell you what you want to know.	Jien ngħidlek dak li trid tkun taf.
I have to ask.	Jiena li għandi nistaqsi.
It's getting late.	Qed isir tard.
But enough of that.	Imma biżżejjed minn hekk.
No one appeared.	Ħadd ma deher.
It came as follows.	Ġie kif ġej.
It’s the only thing you have to do now.	Hija l-unika ħaġa li għandek tagħmel issa.
No one ever knew for sure.	Ħadd qatt ma kien jaf żgur.
We have to go there.	Irridu mmorru hemm.
This is for me.	Din hija għalija.
This did not take long.	Dan ma tantx ħa ħafna żmien.
I was there and I did.	Kien hemm u għamilt hekk.
It wasn’t going to be easy.	Ma kienx se jkun faċli.
It can’t be everything for everyone.	Ma tistax tkun kollox għal kulħadd.
And let me tell you something.	U ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
You are more than that.	Int aktar minn hekk.
You will both be here more often than not.	Int it-tnejn tkun hawn aktar spiss milli le.
Look at it like this.	Ħares lejn bħal dan.
It was so.	Kienet hekk.
It was yours.	Kien tiegħek.
It was a little.	Kien ftit.
They were already here.	Diġà kienu hawn.
They never were.	Qatt ma kienu.
Really, really easy.	Verament, tassew faċli.
How much fun it is.	Kemm hu gost.
And it's definitely a good thing.	U żgur li hija ħaġa tajba.
But nothing seems to work.	Imma xejn ma jidher li jaħdem.
He may have been talking to you.	Seta’ kien qed jitkellem miegħek.
Not so sure.	Mhux hekk żgur.
All that was there.	Dak kollu li kien hemm.
You can't do that.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan hekk.
More than you think you know.	Aktar milli taħseb li taf.
That will never happen again.	Dak qatt mhu se jerġa’ jiġri.
Not much to see.	Mhux wisq x'tara.
I want to know what’s going on here.	Irrid inkun naf x'qed jiġri hawn.
Good or bad.	Tajjeb jew ħażin.
Ridt.	Ridt.
It can have.	Jista’ jkollu.
There was little chance of winning.	Ftit deher ċans li seta’ jirbaħ.
This actually happens.	Dan fil-fatt jiġri.
Not so much about.	Mhux tant dwar.
Maybe they were out.	Forsi kienu barra.
But it would be wrong.	Imma jkun ħażin.
I wait first and see if it passes.	Nistenna l-ewwel u nara jekk għadda.
This will be very difficult.	Dan se jkun diffiċli ħafna.
About any of this.	Dwar xi wieħed minn dan.
That's very good.	Dak tajjeb ħafna.
Everyone seemed to think this was a good idea.	Kulħadd deher ħaseb li din kienet idea tajba.
Not a little.	Mhux xi ftit.
I hope it will help.	Nittama li se jgħin.
We knew it was there.	Konna nafu li kien hemm.
In fact, you shouldn’t.	Fil-fatt, m'għandekx.
Well we can.	Ukoll nistgħu.
Everyone would be happy.	Kulħadd ikun kuntent.
He is becoming a man.	Qed isir raġel.
I couldn’t take it anymore.	Ma stajtx nieħu aktar.
If anything, it gets harder.	Jekk xejn, isir aktar diffiċli.
He loved it.	Huwa kien iħobb dan.
And not so.	U mhux hekk.
Or, you know.	Jew, taf.
Now you know what will happen, and you know what you want.	Issa taf x’se jiġri, u taf li trid.
No, not people.	Le, mhux nies.
I think it will go pretty well.	Naħseb li se tmur pjuttost tajjeb.
It looked good.	Deher tajjeb.
He thought he was ready.	Huwa ħaseb li kien lest.
She was thinking about everything wrong.	Kienet taħseb dwar kollox ħażin.
Here's what you need to know.	Hawn dak li għandek bżonn tkun taf.
It won't take you long.	Mhux se tieħu inti twil.
I know what's going to happen there.	Naf x’se jiġri hemmhekk.
Now you are talking.	Issa qed titkellem.
It has always been very easy.	Huwa dejjem kien faċli ħafna.
Not just mine.	Mhux tiegħi biss.
She knew she wasn’t.	Kienet taf li ma kinitx.
That he did, of course.	Li għamel, ovvjament.
I can’t understand why it’s not coming.	Ma nistax nifhem għaliex mhux ġej.
That's there.	Dak hu hemmhekk.
Well.	Ukoll.
Obviously not the same.	Ovvjament mhux l-istess.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwarha.
It couldn’t happen.	Ma setax jiġri.
Obviously, he did.	Ovvjament, hekk għamel.
A little.	Ftit.
Not bad, he thought.	Mhux ħażin, ħaseb.
He had been waiting for this.	Kien ilu jistenna dan.
It's out.	Huwa barra.
We need to know who did this.	Irridu nkunu nafu min għamel dan.
Definitely someone to see.	Żgur li xi ħadd jara.
We know this is difficult.	Nafu li dan huwa diffiċli.
He was a small man.	Kien raġel żgħir.
I know it’s hard to take.	Naf li huwa diffiċli li tieħu.
It was.	Kien.
I don’t know what to do.	Ma nafx x'se tagħmel.
Come on, come on.	Ejja, ejja.
I was you.	Kont int.
It may not be like mine, it may not be like yours.	Jista 'ma jkunx bħal tiegħi, jista' ma jkunx bħal tiegħek.
And it was.	U kienet.
Maybe more than that.	Forsi aktar minn hekk.
Not from school time.	Mhux minn żmien l-iskola.
Worth a try.	Ta’ min jipprova.
He was there when he died.	Kien hemm meta miet.
Not all have.	Mhux kollha għandhom.
They probably won’t do that.	X'aktarx mhux se jagħmlu dan.
I couldn’t have a good time.	Ma stajtx tagħmel ħin tajjeb.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
I'm pretty sure.	Jien pjuttost ċert.
This works as follows.	Dan jaħdem kif ġej.
I'm not going that way.	Jien mhux sejjer hekk.
I'm good and happy.	Jien tajjeb u kuntent.
There was nothing you could do.	Ma kien hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel.
It was a long time before it came to me.	Kien żmien twil qabel ma ġie għalija.
You have to think fast.	Trid taħseb malajr.
I will not do this with you.	Jien mhux se nagħmel dan miegħek.
He couldn’t think about it now.	Ma setax jaħseb dwar dan issa.
How can this be?	Kif jista’ jkun dan?
That too would be wrong.	Dan ukoll ikun ħażin.
And it was too late.	U kien tard wisq.
I can do that.	Nista’ nagħmel dan.
That was like yesterday for me.	Dik kien qisu lbieraħ għalija.
comes every morning.	jiġi kull filgħodu.
But this time.	Imma din darba.
Where I was.	Fejn kont.
Who knows how many people there are.	Min jaf kemm hemm nies.
It really is long.	Verament huwa twil.
This you need today.	Dan għandek bżonn illum.
Could he do that? 	Seta’ jagħmel dan?
In addition ,.	Barra minn hekk,.
That should be fine.	Dan għandu jkun tajjeb.
There was a lot of good and a little bad.	Kien hemm ħafna tajjeb u ftit ħażin.
You’re not that big yet.	Għadek m'intix daqshekk kbir.
If it is.	Jekk ikun.
Nothing looked good.	Xejn ma deher tajjeb.
You have to be all.	Għandek tiġi kollha.
It's great.	Huwa kbir.
You are right about that.	Għandek raġun dwar dan.
That was wrong.	Dak kien ħażin.
No one was ready.	Ħadd ma kien lest.
He said he had no idea.	Qal li ma kellux idea.
I don't know that.	Jien ma nafx li.
Too, too fast.	Wisq, malajr wisq.
I didn’t say anything, of course.	Jien ma għedt xejn, ovvjament.
I don’t know, of course.	Ma nafx, ovvjament.
Which looks pretty good.	Li jidher pjuttost tajjeb.
It's better that we don't.	Huwa aħjar li aħna ma.
That was never his job.	Dak qatt ma kien ix-xogħol tiegħu.
I know you had to do it.	Naf li kellek tagħmel dan.
She didn't.	Hija ma.
That’s pretty much what you know.	Dak huwa pjuttost dak li taf.
Nobody is there.	Ħadd hemm.
You were right about many things.	Kellek raġun dwar ħafna affarijiet.
Another tomorrow.	Għada oħra.
You do things together.	Inti tagħmel affarijiet flimkien.
One she knows.	Waħda hi taf.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
And there is little time.	U ma tantx hemm ħin.
I wasn’t ready to go.	Ma kontx lest li mmur.
This much and no more.	Dan ħafna u mhux aktar.
Maybe that was it.	Forsi dan kien.
Not at work, not at home.	Mhux fuq ix-xogħol, mhux id-dar.
Because there are so many.	Għaliex hemm tant.
You still.	Għadek.
Many.	Ħafna.
You see this.	Inti tara dan.
That was over a year ago now.	Dan kien aktar minn sena ilu issa.
I was a man.	Jien kont raġel.
And they were.	U kienu.
If ever.	Jekk qatt.
There is no way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod.
Maybe it still is.	Forsi għadu.
I was sure he needed my help.	Kont ċert li kellu bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħi.
Not that he ever said much.	Mhux li qatt qal ħafna.
It's not a one-man idea.	Mhux idea ta’ raġel wieħed.
Now it works well.	Issa jaħdem tajjeb.
I didn't tell anyone what was going on.	Jien ma għedt lil ħadd x’kien qed jiġri.
It was completely ready.	Kien lest għal kollox.
It can be quite difficult.	Jista 'jkun pjuttost diffiċli.
You have to go.	Trid tmur.
It's about the same.	Huwa dwar l-istess.
He is coming soon.	Huwa ġej dalwaqt.
Maybe it was my problem.	Forsi kienet il-problema tiegħi.
Sure, we’ve done this before.	Żgur, għamilna dan qabel.
You are very tall, 'he said.	Inti twil ħafna,’ qal.
Not fully dressed yet.	Għadu mhux liebes għal kollox.
I couldn't believe it!	Ma kontx nemmen!
This can be wrong.	Dan jista 'jkun ħażin.
Just to see you.	Biss biex tara int.
Maybe she had lovers.	Forsi kellha min iħobb.
I could never do that again.	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
And she was, as she knew she was going to be, very beautiful.	U kienet, kif kien jaf li kienet se tkun, sabiħa ħafna.
In fact, he is certainly right.	Fil-fatt, żgur li għandu raġun.
It's like everything.	Huwa bħal kollox.
Out for you.	Barra għalik.
I heard nothing more.	Ma smajt xejn aktar.
More than we ever had.	Aktar milli qatt kellna.
Not since he left.	Mhux minn meta mar.
Many, in fact.	Ħafna, fil-fatt.
And where it came from, no one seems to know.	U minn fejn ġie, ħadd ma jidhirx li jaf.
There was more to it than that.	Kien hemm aktar minn hekk.
Something happened, something happened, something happened.	Xi ħaġa ġara, ġara, ġara xi ħaġa.
He often does such things.	Ħafna drabi jagħmel affarijiet bħal dawn.
It's not certain.	Huwa mhux ċert.
It doesn’t seem right to me.	Ma jidhirx li huwa tajjeb għalija.
So are we.	Hekk aħna.
This can help if someone needs it.	Dan jista 'jgħin jekk xi ħadd ikollu bżonn.
I want it all.	Irrid dan kollu.
I’m sure you do the same thing.	Jien ċert li tagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
I know.	Jien naf.
She was doing it.	Kienet tagħmel dan.
What is mine is yours.	Dak li hu tiegħi huwa tiegħek.
You can’t be thinking about it.	Ma tistax tkun taħseb dwarha.
He wanted to play.	Ried jilgħab.
Not a big deal.	Mhix xi ħaġa kbira.
This can be a problem.	Din tista’ tkun problema.
No one is ever exactly the same as another.	Ħadd qatt mhu eżatt l-istess bħal ieħor.
He probably did.	Huwa probabbli li għamel.
But he hardly did that.	Imma ma tantx kien jagħmel dan.
That's what happened.	Hekk ġara.
This looks good.	Dan jidher tajjeb.
And so he will be doing.	U hekk se jkun qed jagħmel.
Definitely don’t know.	Żgur li ma jafx.
He said nothing.	Ma qal xejn.
John has to leave.	John ikollu jitlaq.
Sure, he said.	Żgur, qal.
I know exactly what happened.	Naf eżatt x'ġara.
It would be good for me.	Ikun tajjeb għalija.
This should be easy.	Dan għandu jkun faċli.
And that’s what you want.	U dak hu li trid.
I have a son.	Għandi tifel.
I appeared.	I deher.
I did well with this.	Jien għamilt tajjeb b'dan.
Both of them are.	It-tnejn li huma hi.
Everything seems so long ago.	Kollox jidher daqshekk twil ilu.
He is trying to get to you.	Huwa qed jipprova jasal għandek.
He can't say.	Ma jistax jgħid.
You can make your own as follows.	Tista 'tagħmel tiegħek kif ġej.
I understand where you are coming from.	Nifhem minn fejn qed ġej.
So will we.	Hekk se aħna.
I don’t want to know things.	Ma rridx inkun naf l-affarijiet.
You will resume.	Inti se jerġa.
So it must be.	Hekk għandu jkun.
Maybe a little too much.	Forsi ftit wisq.
I will only be able to do this again tonight.	Inkun nista' nagħmel dan darba oħra biss illejla.
This works very well.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
No, more than that.	Le, aktar minn hekk.
We really have.	Tassew għandna.
None of this was.	Xejn minn dan ma kien.
In fact, things are getting harder now.	Fil-fatt, l-affarijiet issa huma aktar diffiċli.
He would settle down again.	Kieku jerġa' joqgħod.
He had nothing more to say.	Ma kellux aktar xi jgħid.
I wasn’t good.	Jien ma kontx tajjeb.
This one maybe.	Dan wieħed forsi.
And she can be.	U hi tista 'tkun.
Why he does so is harder to say.	Għaliex jagħmel hekk huwa aktar diffiċli li wieħed jgħid.
I’m not the same person I knew.	Jien mhux l-istess persuna li kont taf.
I have to go home.	Ikolli mmur id-dar.
But this may be going a little too far.	Imma dan jista 'jkun qed imur ftit wisq.
We have something for once and something for another time.	Għandna xi ħaġa għal darba u xi ħaġa għal żmien ieħor.
Really, we did.	Tassew, għamilna.
He didn’t have one now, but he will soon.	Ma kellux waħda issa, imma dalwaqt se.
I'm for that.	Jien għal dak.
Well, almost everyone.	Ukoll, kważi kulħadd.
I don't even know what to say about that.	Lanqas naf x’se ngħid dwar dan.
I want you to know that as soon as possible.	Irrid li tkun taf li malajr kemm jista 'jkun.
She won't.	Hi mhux se.
It’s all or nothing.	Huwa kollox jew xejn.
Well, maybe you are now.	Ukoll, forsi inti issa.
Not a few.	Mhux ftit.
I know why you're here.	Naf għaliex int hawn.
He knew we were there.	Kien jaf li konna hemm.
But he doesn't have time for that right now.	Imma m’għandux ħin għal dan bħalissa.
They felt too bad to help.	Ħassu ħażin wisq biex jgħin.
Or better yet.	Jew aħjar.
It was not so.	Ma kienx hekk.
This is what we often do.	Dan ħafna drabi nagħmlu aħna.
Not bad.	Mhux ħażin.
It had been there for years.	Kien ilu hemm għal snin.
And now it has to.	U issa għandu.
I really can't.	Verament ma nistax.
Way, too hard.	Mod, wisq diffiċli.
I didn't have to.	I ma kellux.
You can do this now.	Tista 'tagħmel dan issa.
And boy, does it work.	U tifel, jaħdem.
Up to this book.	Sa dan il-ktieb.
Look at the time.	Ħares lejn il-ħin.
He was doing all the work.	Kien jagħmel ix-xogħol kollu.
That was really so.	Dak kien tassew hekk.
I have been doing this for some time.	Ilni nagħmel dan għal xi żmien.
Never do so.	Qatt ma jagħmel hekk.
I know this is small.	Naf li dan huwa żgħir.
It was too much of everything.	Kien wisq minn kollox.
How are you	Kif int?
I don’t know how, but he was right.	Ma nafx kif, imma kellu raġun.
That can never happen again.	Dak qatt ma jista’ jerġa’ jiġri.
Please hope this is a job for you.	Jekk jogħġbok nittama li dan huwa xogħol għalik.
I know nothing about it.	Jien ma naf xejn dwarha.
It’s hard to make friends.	Huwa diffiċli li tagħmel ħbieb.
For me, this has always been a problem.	Għalija, din dejjem kienet problema.
So will we.	Hekk se aħna.
All is not well.	Kollox mhux tajjeb.
I make more money than he does.	Jien nagħmel aktar flus milli jagħmel hu.
It can have.	Jista’ jkollu.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Kollox deher sejjer tajjeb.
Can someone please help.	Jekk jogħġbok jista' xi ħadd jgħin.
He plans to stay here for a while.	Jippjana li jibqa’ hawn għal xi żmien.
And so you make money.	U hekk tagħmel flus.
This is the last.	Din hija l-aħħar.
But it was too early for that.	Imma kien kmieni wisq għal dan.
Over and over and over again.	Aktar u aktar u aktar mill-ġdid.
I can't do anything about it.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn dwar dan.
Most everyone does, from time to time.	Ħafna kulħadd jagħmel, minn żmien għal żmien.
It does well on its own.	Jagħmel tajjeb waħdu.
It was over there.	Kien hemm fuq.
He got there first.	Huwa wasal hemm l-ewwel.
And here it is.	U hawn hu.
And so is yours.	U hekk ukoll tiegħek.
And maybe she would like that.	U forsi hi tixtieq hekk.
I think we were too late for that.	Naħseb li konna tard wisq għal dan.
I can understand everyone.	Kapaċi nifhem lil kulħadd.
He’s like a boy.	Huwa bħal tifel.
It was not so.	Ma kienx hekk.
And there is no one.	U m'hemm ħadd.
Better than anything we have.	Aħjar minn kull ħaġa li għandna.
What is this? 	X'inhu dan?
he asked.	staqsa.
I'm sure he'll be with you soon.	Jien ċert li dalwaqt ikun miegħek.
Now, let’s.	Issa, ejja.
Not a bad thing.	Mhix xi ħaġa ħażina.
Nothing was happening.	Ma kien jiġri xejn.
Who really knows.	Min jaf tassew.
No one had ever done this before.	Ħadd qatt ma kien għamel dan qabel.
There is more.	Hemm aktar.
So have you.	Hekk għandek.
I'm still like that.	Għadni hekk.
This had not happened to me.	Dan ma kienx ġara lili.
It was good.	Kien tajjeb.
If anyone can do it, they can.	Jekk xi ħadd jista’ jagħmel dan, jista’.
Sure you know.	Żgur li taf.
So he did tonight.	Hekk għamel illejla.
Tomorrow evening, come on.	Għada filgħaxija, tiġi.
He will not leave.	Mhux se jitlaq.
I get along very well with everyone.	Nifhem tassew tajjeb ma’ kulħadd.
It was just what we needed.	Kien biss dak li kellna bżonn.
I have to wait.	Ikolli nistenna.
Yours is what he needs.	Tiegħek huwa dak li għandu bżonn.
Everyone was scared.	Kulħadd kien jibża.
All was well with me.	Dak kollu kien tajjeb miegħi.
I go shopping alone.	Immur nixtri waħdi.
I can't do it now.	Ma nistax nagħmel issa.
Enough for him.	Biżżejjed għalih.
You can't stand it.	Ma tistax toqgħod.
Now this house.	Issa din id-dar.
It didn’t have to be.	Ma kellux għalfejn ikun.
I have heard from time to time.	Smajt minn żmien għal żmien.
It's not really there.	Mhuwiex verament hemm.
Mine was the first.	Tiegħi kien l-ewwel.
Not much, but something.	Mhux ħafna, imma xi ħaġa.
Having said that, you don’t have to say anything else.	Wara li qal dan, m'għandekx għalfejn tgħid xi ħaġa oħra.
It was more than that.	Kien aktar minn hekk.
It wasn’t just about her.	Ma kienx biss dwarha.
I don’t want to make this harder than it needs to be.	Ma rridx nagħmel dan aktar diffiċli milli jeħtieġ.
More time than we have.	Aktar ħin minn dak li għandna.
It's probably really great.	Huwa probabbilment verament kbir.
But you don’t have to.	Imma m'għandekx għalfejn.
It's good.	Huwa tajjeb.
What was he saying?	X’kien qed jgħid?
Well, well, that was good.	Tajjeb, tajjeb, dan kien tajjeb.
Which, of course, would not have been the case.	Li, ovvjament, ma kienx ikun.
No one lives forever.	Ħadd ma jgħix għal dejjem.
Well, she was there.	Ukoll, hija kienet hemm.
We will go back there now.	Aħna se mmorru lura hemmhekk issa.
I was surprised but very happy to go.	Kont sorpriż imma kuntent ħafna li mmur.
I can't, actually.	Ma nistax, fil-fatt.
Does anyone know how to play? 	Xi ħadd jaf jilgħab?
he asked.	staqsa.
It seems pretty easy.	Jidher pjuttost faċli.
And that was it now.	U dan kien issa.
You were here.	Int kont hawn.
I just thought he had you.	Ħsibt biss li kellu inti.
It happens from time to time.	Jiġri minn żmien għal żmien.
They just do.	Huma biss jagħmlu.
Maybe something of me.	Forsi xi ħaġa minni.
She was thinking.	Kienet taħseb.
Does this help ?.	Dan jgħin?.
Maybe everything.	Forsi kollox.
So was another man.	Hekk kien raġel ieħor.
This happened about a year ago.	Dan ġara madwar sena ilu.
This is not mine.	Din mhix tiegħi.
The latter one.	Din l-aħħar waħda.
I don’t know if he will survive.	Ma nafx jekk hux se jgħix.
What happened is what happened.	Dak li ġara huwa dak li ġara.
I would never do such a thing.	Jien qatt ma nagħmel ħaġa bħal din.
Like she knew something.	Bħal hi kienet taf xi ħaġa.
Did everything go well?	Kollox mar tajjeb?
Nothing will ever be the same.	Xejn qatt mhu se jkun l-istess.
I want to talk a little with you.	Irrid nitkellem ftit miegħek.
Well, actually nothing.	Ukoll, fil-fatt xejn.
We both know it won’t work.	It-tnejn nafu li mhux se jaħdem.
She wants it out, and she wants it out now.	Hija trid barra, u trid barra issa.
If not, it’s too late to do anything about it.	Jekk le, huwa tard wisq biex tagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
I hope they are.	Nispera li huma.
He was waiting for me to ask.	Kien qed jistenna lili nistaqsi.
I'm coming.	Jien ġej.
Now, one last chance.	Issa, l-aħħar ċans.
You want to be who she is now.	Trid tkun min hi issa.
It's just harder.	Huwa biss aktar diffiċli.
It didn’t leave that way.	Mhux telaq hekk.
I’m still not quite me.	Jien għadni mhux pjuttost jien.
I'm tired.	Jien għajjien.
Nor was it easy to speak.	Lanqas ma kien faċli li titkellem.
It's not really a problem.	Mhuwiex verament problema.
What are you talking about.	X'qed jitkellem dwar.
Wherever you want.	Kull fejn tixtieq.
I'm glad you're here.	Jien kuntent li qiegħed hawn.
And it was years ago.	U kien snin ilu.
This seems to be wrong.	Dan jidher li huwa ħażin.
It's like this.	Huwa bħal dan.
That three years ago.	Dak tliet snin ilu.
I think it’s wrong.	Naħseb li huwa ħażin.
It’s never too late to be happy.	Qatt mhu tard wisq biex tkun ferħan.
You know what that is.	Inti taf x'inhu dak.
It was bad enough.	Kien ħażin biżżejjed.
Say something good or say something bad.	Għid xi ħaġa tajba jew għid xi ħaġa ħażina.
No one saw what was coming.	Ħadd ma ra dak ġej.
We never did that.	Qatt ma għamilna hekk.
It arrived in the morning.	Wasal filgħodu.
Well, that was good.	Ukoll, li kien tajjeb.
It's early in the morning.	Huwa kmieni filgħodu.
Probably very little.	Probabbilment ftit ħafna.
It was quite small.	Kien pjuttost żgħir.
But that's easy.	Imma dak faċli.
Too often.	Spiss wisq.
I knew where this was going.	Kont naf fejn sejjer dan.
To do something about it.	Biex tagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
That was when, a long time ago now.	Dan kien meta, żmien twil ilu issa.
This is what we do.	Dan huwa dak li nagħmlu.
We have to do this every year.	Għandna nagħmlu dan kull sena.
It gets better and better.	Jiġi aħjar u aħjar.
There is nothing.	M'hemm xejn.
I didn’t know one person.	Jien ma kont naf persuna waħda.
I just didn’t know.	Jien biss ma kontx naf.
He didn’t even need to win.	Lanqas ma kellu bżonn jirbaħ.
And it was.	U kien.
You don’t have to for that.	M'għandekx għal dak.
.	.
I hope to come soon.	Nispera li jiġi dalwaqt.
You can do this for me.	Tista 'tagħmel dan għalija.
I’m a person, and we need things.	Jien persuna, u għandna bżonn affarijiet.
The help was good.	L-għajnuna kienet tajba.
We did things.	Għamilna l-affarijiet.
No one else seems to.	Ħadd ieħor jidher li.
We did what we had to.	Għamilna dak li kellna.
It was no more money.	Ma kienx aktar flus.
But that’s not the same thing.	Imma dik mhix l-istess ħaġa.
But other things would.	Imma affarijiet oħra kieku.
Our house is big.	Id-dar tagħna hija kbira.
You can make a lot of money.	Inti tista 'tagħmel ħafna flus.
He has always been good to you.	Huwa dejjem kien tajjeb għalik.
We need to know what he did.	Irridu nkunu nafu dak li għamel.
I can't tell you.	Ma nistax ngħidlek.
I went there.	Mort hemm.
But that wasn’t the only time it happened.	Imma dik ma kinitx l-unika darba li ġara.
Like as hard as it can be.	Bħal kemm jista 'jkun diffiċli.
But that wasn’t good enough.	Imma dan ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed.
He died three years ago.	Miet tliet snin ilu.
It would be, perhaps, even if we did so here.	Ikun, forsi, ukoll jekk għamilna hekk hawn.
You look a bit tired.	Inti tidher daqsxejn għajjien.
I did so.	Jien hekk għamilt.
At the time it seemed like nothing.	Dak iż-żmien kien deher li xejn.
I saw this.	Rajt dan.
Too much, maybe.	Wisq, forsi.
After all that work.	Wara dak ix-xogħol kollu.
I hope you know what you are doing.	Nispera li tkun taf x'qed tagħmel.
I was very glad for this.	Kont ferħan ħafna għal dan.
That is.	Li hu.
But it is not so.	Imma mhux hekk hu.
I talk about it.	nitkellem dwarha.
I wanted to do everything very well.	Ridt tagħmel kollox tajjeb ħafna.
Everything will be.	Kollox ser ikun.
He was sure.	Kien ċert.
You have to, of course.	Inti għandek, ovvjament.
But no one really is.	Imma ħadd ma hu verament.
No one will do this for you.	Ħadd mhu se jagħmel dan għalik.
Do you have friends who.	Għandek ħbieb li.
Maybe I should say something.	Forsi ngħid xi ħaġa.
It works for me.	Jaħdem għalija.
Tard.	Tard.
He won’t be back for a while.	Mhux se jkun lura għal xi żmien.
He didn’t expect that, either.	Hu ma kienx jistenna li, lanqas.
Or it doesn’t.	Jew ma jagħmilx hekk.
Just a little more.	Biss ftit aktar.
That could be all.	Dan jista 'jkun dan kollu.
He wasn’t a bad man, really.	Hu ma kienx raġel ħażin, tassew.
Well, that was good to know.	Ukoll, dan kien tajjeb li tkun taf.
Everyone was working on one thing.	Kulħadd kien qed jaħdem fuq ħaġa waħda.
This will be the last one.	Din se tkun l-aħħar waħda.
It’s not a way for a child to be.	Mhuwiex mod għal tifel li jkun.
There was nothing for that.	Ma kien hemm xejn għal dan.
He reappeared, but not often.	Kien jerġa’ jidher, imma mhux spiss.
It will take more time.	Se jieħu aktar ħin.
Everything is going well.	Kollox sejjer tajjeb.
That he did.	Li għamel dan.
You don't have to do anything.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel xejn.
He was very much alone.	Kien waħdu ħafna.
But maybe that's more my problem than yours.	Imma forsi dik hija aktar il-problema tiegħi milli tiegħek.
I didn’t want to ask before.	Ma ridtx nistaqsi qabel.
Well, he did.	Ukoll, dan għamel.
I'm sorry, but there you have it.	Jiddispjaċini, imma hemm għandek.
She knew he did.	Kienet taf li għamel.
It’s time to be alone.	Wasal iż-żmien li nkun waħdi.
You had long enough.	Kellek twil biżżejjed.
So he told me.	Hekk qalli.
So long ago.	Hekk twil ilu.
I love our home.	Inħobb id-dar tagħna.
There is a lot of help for everyone.	Hemm ħafna għajnuna għal kulħadd.
He seems to be right.	Jidher li għandu raġun.
Well, that’s just wrong, my friend.	Ukoll, dan huwa biss ħażin, ħabib tiegħi.
I was alone.	Kont waħdi.
It should be easy.	Għandu jkun faċli.
You may be glad you heard that.	Inti jista 'jkun kuntent li smajt dan.
Everything else is as it should be.	Kollox ieħor huwa kif għandu jkun.
It seems too much, what they have.	Jidher wisq, dak li għandhom.
He is.	Huwa hu.
And he was the only one.	U kien l-uniku wieħed.
I think for another time.	Naħseb li għal żmien ieħor.
I probably didn’t want to know.	Probabbilment ma ridtx inkun naf.
I don’t believe he even wanted to do that.	Ma nemmen li lanqas ried jagħmel dan.
I'm enough.	Jien biżżejjed.
But he did not want to stay in the room forever.	Imma ma riedx jibqa’ fil-kamra għal dejjem.
It just gets better and better.	Huwa biss isir aħjar u aħjar.
Everything you need to know.	Dak kollu li għandek bżonn tkun taf.
I was good with him.	Jiena kont tajjeb miegħu.
I was never here.	Qatt ma kont hawn.
I'm on top of everything.	Jien fuq kollox.
He doesn’t have to be worried.	Huwa m'għandux għalfejn ikun inkwetat.
It would be.	Kienet tkun.
It was so very small.	Kien tant żgħir ħafna.
We both knew where we were going.	It-tnejn konna nafu fejn irridu mmorru.
I'm not like that.	Jien mhux hekk.
It seems she didn’t have much.	Jidher li ma tantx kellha.
There was no one.	Ma kien hemm ħadd.
But it was something.	Imma kienet xi ħaġa.
I thought it was going to be really hard, but it wasn't.	Ħsibt li se jkun verament diffiċli, imma ma kienx.
He says it’s time.	Jgħid li wasal iż-żmien.
Never me.	Qatt lili.
She will not come to you.	Hi mhux se tiġi għandek.
I want to hear what it was, not what it was.	Irrid nisma’ x’kien, mhux dak li ma kienx.
The dog was too fast for him.	Il-kelb kien malajr wisq għalih.
It's too hard so.	Huwa diffiċli wisq hekk.
I think you had an account there.	Naħseb li kellek kont hemm.
I think we were right about that.	Naħseb li kellna raġun fuq dik.
It has never happened before.	Qatt ma ġara qabel.
It may be the same with you.	Jista 'jkun l-istess miegħek.
I'm so happy.	Jien tant kuntent.
he said.	hu qal.
I knew something was wrong.	Kont naf li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
Like, much more.	Bħal, ħafna aktar.
Or if it was, no one told me.	Jew jekk kien, ħadd ma qalli.
That just looked bad.	Dak biss deher ħażin.
This was my home.	Din kienet id-dar tiegħi.
He’s just a kid, after all.	Huwa biss tifel, wara kollox.
Tell someone she was okay.	Tgħid lil xi ħadd li kienet tajjeb.
I think a lot of people were.	Naħseb li ħafna nies kienu.
We knew we could do better.	Konna nafu li nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar.
One year was enough.	Sena kienet biżżejjed.
We don’t need that.	M'għandniex bżonn dak.
There was nothing there, of course.	Ma kien hemm xejn hemmhekk, ovvjament.
He didn’t want you to know.	Ma riedx li tkun taf.
He had never seen anything like it.	Qatt ma kien ra xi ħaġa bħal dawn.
He had had a few friends.	Kien kellu ftit ħbieb.
I won't need that.	I mhux se bżonn li.
You never know why.	Qatt ma tkun taf għaliex.
Never say anything again.	Qatt aktar xi ngħid.
But there is.	Imma hemm.
Everything else was fine.	Kollox ieħor kien tajjeb.
Not so bad.	Mhuwiex daqshekk ħażin.
It was my only chance.	Kienet l-unika ċans tiegħi.
But someone wants to.	Imma xi ħadd irid.
I can be there for you.	Jien nista' nkun hemm għalik.
He was going with you.	Kien imur miegħek.
Someone did, that’s for sure.	Xi ħadd għamel, dan żgur.
Being one.	Li tkun waħda.
He was worried.	Huwa kien inkwetat.
It was good.	Kien tajjeb.
It could have been someone.	Seta’ kien xi ħadd.
It's at home for you.	Huwa fuq id-dar għalik.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
He probably did.	Huwa probabbli li għamel.
The le the le the le.	Le le le le le.
He will be home tomorrow evening.	Hu ser ikun id-dar għada filgħaxija.
Alone.	Waħdu.
But you know what happened.	Imma taf x’ġara.
Well, more than ever.	Tajjeb, aktar minn kull darba.
Now, that's usually not a problem.	Issa, normalment dik ma tkunx problema.
Not a problem.	Mhux problema.
Great one, and I did well.	Waħda kbira, u għamilt tajjeb.
I'm not.	Jien ma tantx.
This is really bad too.	Dan huwa verament ħażin wisq.
He is still tired easy.	Huwa għadu għajjien faċli.
The problem is still there.	Il-problema għadha hemm.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx.
Doing this a few times will be easier.	Li tagħmel dan ftit drabi se tkun aktar faċli.
He started getting more and more worried.	Huwa beda aktar u aktar inkwetat.
I’ve been on one lately.	Kont fuq waħda dan l-aħħar.
But that too was beautiful.	Imma dik ukoll kienet sabiħa.
This did nothing.	Dan ma għamel xejn.
He was not happy about it.	Ma kienx kuntent dwar dan.
But maybe not.	Imma forsi mhux.
Maybe you are ready, maybe you are not.	Forsi inti lest, forsi m'intix.
Maybe now was the time.	Forsi issa kien iż-żmien.
He said why not.	Qal għaliex le.
I loved it.	Jien kont inħobb.
You have to do it.	Għandek tagħmel dan.
But it’s not happening.	Imma mhux qed jiġri.
Now it's up to one.	Issa huwa sa wieħed.
But there is more to it than that.	Imma hemm aktar minn hekk.
It's very good.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna.
I have a lot.	Għandi ħafna.
There was nothing else we could do.	Ma kien hemm xejn ieħor li nistgħu nagħmlu.
It seems really difficult.	Jidher tassew diffiċli.
I was worried about that.	Jien kont inkwetat b’dan.
I knew what he really wanted.	Kont naf xi ried verament.
He is not alone.	Huwa mhux waħdu.
I just thought you should know.	Biss ħsibt li għandek tkun taf.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Ma nafx x'qed jiġri.
And for how long.	U għal kemm żmien.
I’m sure it won’t be a problem.	Jien ċert li mhux se tkun problema.
Where it should be.	Fejn kellu jkun.
Tell me a little.	Qalli ftit.
Something more me.	Xi ħaġa aktar jien.
This is something he is doing for you.	Din hija xi ħaġa li qed tagħmel għalik.
I just knew.	Kont naf biss.
He can't do that.	Ma jistax jagħmel dan.
I have you now.	Għandi inti issa.
The timing was bad.	Il-ħin kien ħażin.
Please try.	Jekk jogħġbok ipprova.
It just so happens.	Jiġri biss hekk.
Very little happens as everything happens.	Ftit li xejn jiġri hekk kif jiġri kollox.
And that's a good thing.	U dik hija ħaġa tajba.
But he was not here.	Imma hu ma kienx hawn.
He is a friend.	Huwa ħabib.
Maybe a lot more.	Forsi ħafna aktar.
It is now almost noon.	Issa huwa kważi nofsinhar.
How to leave.	Kif jitlaq.
He doesn't know what he's doing.	Ma jafx x’qed jagħmel.
It's better.	Huwa aħjar.
And very happy about it.	U kuntent ħafna dwar dan.
Come on.	Ejja.
But she knows it's too early.	Imma hi taf li għadu kmieni.
I would like to hear more about this.	Nixtieq nisma aktar dwar dan.
I’ve been listening to someone until now.	Jien kont nisma lil xi ħadd sa issa.
When we were.	Meta konna aħna.
There is a much easier way to do this.	Hemm mod ħafna aktar faċli kif tagħmel dan.
Now we have other problems.	Issa għandna problemi oħra.
I have no problem with that.	M'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan.
I said it was mine.	Għidt li kien tiegħi.
Tonight, he thought, tonight would be the last one.	Illejla, ħaseb, illejla tkun l-aħħar waħda.
Maybe you can be glad to see me from and after.	Forsi inti tista 'tkun ferħan li tara lili minn u wara.
And it was, too.	U kien, ukoll.
It's coming.	Huwa ġej.
Now, another thing.	Issa, ħaġa oħra.
Come on man.	Ejja raġel.
It would work.	Ikun jaħdem.
She needed something else to think about.	Hija kellha bżonn xi ħaġa oħra biex taħseb dwarha.
I believe you.	Jien nemmen li inti.
Not so fast.	Mhux daqshekk malajr.
I'm sorry.	Jiddispjaċini.
It's been a long time.	Kien żmien pjuttost twil.
I know it will be there, sitting outside.	Naf li se jkun hemm, bilqiegħda barra.
There are very few now.	Hemm ftit ħafna issa.
There is nothing here for me now.	M'hemm xejn hawn għalija issa.
There had to be another way.	Kellu jkun hemm mod ieħor.
What he knew.	Dak li kien jaf.
I told you before.	Kont ngħidlek qabel.
I was right for you.	Kont tajjeb għalik.
I can see that happening.	Nista' nara li jiġri.
There is so much now.	Hemm tant issa.
Obviously, this was not to be.	Ovvjament, dan ma kellux ikun.
Ridt.	Ridt.
This is yours now.	Dan huwa tiegħek issa.
I think it’s great.	Naħseb li huwa kbir.
And, well it shouldn’t.	U, ukoll m'għandux.
No one will stay here.	Ħadd mhu se jibqa’ hawn.
This is work being done.	Dan huwa xogħol li qed isir.
She would be there.	Hi tkun hemm.
I'm glad for you.	Jien ferħan għalik.
You know, he was right.	Taf, kellu raġun.
Not so late.	Mhux daqshekk tard.
We can't do more.	Ma nistgħux nagħmlu aktar.
I would like to see this.	Nixtieq nara dan.
There is something really great about this.	Hemm xi ħaġa tassew kbira dwar dan.
Everything was very easy.	Kollox kien faċli ħafna.
Look where you are, and where everyone is.	Ħares fejn qiegħed, u fejn qiegħed kulħadd.
We knew that.	Dan konna nafu.
It's an easy job.	Huwa u xogħol faċli.
But it's not working tonight.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem illejla.
I did it myself.	Jien għamilt jien.
She was telling the truth.	Kienet tgħid il-verità.
Increasingly, it seems.	Dejjem aktar, jidher.
No more talking.	Mhux aktar jitkellem.
This can take hours.	Dan jista 'jieħu sigħat.
This is not something anyone should want.	Din mhix xi ħaġa li xi ħadd għandu jrid.
They are with me.	Huma miegħi.
What is.	X'inhu.
You want to stay with me.	Trid toqgħod miegħi.
I just did.	Għamilt biss.
Something tells me we can do better.	Xi ħaġa tgħidli li nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar.
Just not sure.	Biss mhux ċert.
I was so scared.	Kont tant jibża.
With each other.	Ma 'xulxin.
So much for that.	Tant dan.
And he saw something more.	U ra xi ħaġa aktar.
And so it was.	U dan kien hekk.
She was thinking a lot.	Kienet taħseb ħafna.
I can do anything.	Kapaċi nagħmel kull ħaġa.
It was hard, it wasn’t a very good time.	Kien diffiċli, ma kienx żmien tajjeb ħafna.
He told me he did.	Huwa qalli li għamel.
That says something.	Li tgħid xi ħaġa.
You can tell me later.	Tista' tgħidli aktar tard.
I want something else.	Irrid xi ħaġa oħra.
This is really great.	Dan huwa verament kbir.
I have no problem.	M'għandi l-ebda problema.
Not enough.	Mhux biżżejjed.
But hey, maybe this isn't a problem.	Imma tajjeb, forsi din mhix problema.
That makes you difficult.	Li tagħmel inti diffiċli.
I thought a lot about it.	Ħsibt ħafna dwar dan.
I will.	Jien se.
This has happened once before.	Dan ġara darba qabel.
I talk to him.	Jien nitkellem miegħu.
And this is it.	U dan hu.
Not now is he gone.	Mhux issa huwa mar.
And that’s where everything goes wrong.	U dak hu dak fejn kollox imur ħażin.
He wanted much, much more.	Ried ħafna, ħafna aktar.
Not as long as you stay there.	Mhux sakemm toqgħod hemm.
It was hard.	Kien diffiċli.
Just for a while.	Biss għal ftit.
Maybe a little more.	Forsi ftit aktar.
I have no money to buy anything.	M'għandi l-ebda flus biex nixtri xi ħaġa.
One cannot say more than that.	Wieħed ma jistax jgħid aktar minn hekk.
It will also be the last.	Se tkun ukoll l-aħħar.
This takes too long.	Dan jieħu wisq żmien.
That’s what it is, nothing more.	Huwa dak li hu, xejn aktar.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ma tista’ tagħmel xejn magħna.
I was just a little boy.	Kont biss tifel żgħir.
And not as big as you might think.	U mhux daqshekk kbir daqs kemm tista’ taħseb.
It was just here.	Kien hawn biss.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
This is one way to do it.	Dan huwa mod wieħed kif tagħmel dan.
I don’t know about that.	Ma nafx dwar dan.
Well, if so.	Tajjeb, jekk hekk kien.
There will be more tomorrow afternoon.	Se jkun hemm aktar għada wara nofsinhar.
Come here now!	Ejja hawn issa!
He knew he was there.	Kien jaf li kien hemm.
Well it's late here.	Ukoll huwa tard hawn.
If he has any.	Jekk ikollu xi.
We know nothing about where he went.	Ma nafu xejn dwar fejn mar.
I will have more later.	Ikolli aktar aktar tard.
It was a few years ago.	Kien ftit snin ilu.
But now it's yours.	Imma issa huwa tiegħek.
Which is too long.	Li huwa twil wisq.
Not something like this again, with any other man.	Mhux xi ħaġa bħal din mill-ġdid, ma 'xi raġel ieħor.
What will he do next?	X'se jagħmel wara?.
Towards.	Lejn.
We have a lot of time.	Għandna ħafna ħin.
He knew what it was.	Kien jaf x’kien.
But we have better.	Imma għandna aħjar.
He entered the room.	Huwa daħal fil-kamra.
You can really see everything.	Tista 'verament tara kollox.
She will know.	Hi se tkun taf.
If you are three years old it is much harder.	Jekk għandek tliet snin huwa ħafna aktar diffiċli.
Easy for him.	Faċli għalih.
He was tired.	Kien għajjien.
It may never be the same.	Jista' qatt ma jkun l-istess.
I wish he had.	Nixtieq li kellu.
Everyone seemed to be having fun.	Kulħadd kien jidher li qed jieħu gost.
If she died tonight, so did she.	Jekk miet illejla, hekk għamlet hi.
I was like a little boy.	Kont bħal tifel żgħir.
I look good.	Nistenna tajjeb.
That’s not me, of course.	Dan mhux jien, ovvjament.
Not us, actually.	Mhux aħna, fil-fatt.
I know.	Naf le.
No, not now.	Le, mhux issa.
It could be that way.	Jista’ jkun hekk.
It is not very easy.	Hija mhix faċli ħafna.
He did it, too.	Huwa għamel dan, ukoll.
Most people do that.	Ħafna nies jagħmlu hekk.
Maybe there is such a thing.	Forsi hemm ħaġa bħal din.
For me, eating out is a great thing.	Għalija, li tiekol barra hija ħaġa kbira.
As usual, he knew what was right.	Bħal ta’ spiss, kien jaf x’inhu tajjeb.
It makes you scared.	Jagħmel inti jibża.
I didn’t have to go.	Jien ma kellix immur.
This was not the time to back down.	Dan ma kienx żmien biex lura.
He is ready.	Huwa lest.
There was nothing he could say or do, of course.	Ma kien hemm xejn li seta’ jgħid jew jagħmel, ovvjament.
Well, of course.	Ukoll, ovvjament.
When there was no one around.	Meta ma kien hemm ħadd madwar.
I’m sitting on one right now.	Jien bilqiegħda fuq waħda bħalissa.
If not more.	Jekk mhux aktar.
You don't have to do this now.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel dan issa.
Come with me now.	Ejja miegħi issa.
But so is he.	Imma hekk hu.
But there is nothing to say.	Imma m'hemm xejn xi ngħid.
Something was wrong here.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina hawn.
It will take a few hours.	Ser tieħu ftit sigħat.
When was it?	Meta kien?
I think it’s a good one.	Naħseb li hija waħda tajba.
No one sees.	Ħadd mhu jara.
I didn’t think it was a good idea.	Ma kontx naħseb li kienet idea tajba.
That would be great.	Dan ikun kbir.
I had to do it.	Kelli nagħmel.
Just for a while.	Biss għal ftit żmien.
They are just people.	Huma biss nies.
This is not easy to do.	Dan mhux faċli li tagħmel.
You can't see over this.	Ma tistax tara fuq dan.
He was very happy.	Kien kuntent ħafna.
You are what you eat.	Int dak li tiekol.
There, better.	Hemmhekk, aħjar.
We do for each other.	Nagħmlu għal xulxin.
It's just like that.	Huwa biss hekk.
Could he have done more?	Seta’ għamel aktar?
You know what's going on.	Taf x’qed jiġri.
He is such a good man.	Huwa daqshekk raġel tajjeb.
Everyone talks about it and no one does anything about it.	Kulħadd jitkellem dwarha u ħadd ma jagħmel xejn dwarha.
I’m sorry he wants to come to this.	Jiddispjaċini li jrid jasal għal dan.
You’re definitely not very good.	Int żgur mhux tajjeb ħafna.
It had to be.	Kellu jkun.
And it will be.	U se jkun.
It was he who was supposed to know things.	Kien hu li suppost kien jaf l-affarijiet.
Good thing and bad thing.	Ħaġa tajba u ħaġa ħażina.
I know it will happen as it happened.	Naf li se jiġri kif ġara.
It’s not really very easy to tell.	Mhuwiex verament faċli ħafna li tgħid.
And that was probably a good thing.	U dan x'aktarx kien tajjeb.
It’s beautiful, beautiful, but it won’t happen.	Hija sabiħa, sabiħa, imma mhux se jiġri.
Come on.	Ejja ftit.
This was not a way for a man to live.	Dan ma kienx mod biex raġel jgħix.
It works for me.	Jaħdem għalija.
This seems like a bad idea.	Din tidher idea ħażina.
And he’s a bad man.	U hu raġel ħażin.
Like this house.	Bħal din id-dar.
It looks so bad.	Jidher hekk ħażin.
That was it.	Dan kien hekk.
I want to be sure.	Irrid inkun ċert.
I'm home.	Jien id-dar.
That could be.	Li jista’ jkun.
You were there.	Int kont hemm.
He didn't like it very much.	Ma tantx kien iħobb.
That's not good.	Dak mhux tajjeb.
It just came out recently.	Dan l-aħħar ħareġ biss.
And now, he won't.	U issa, hu mhux se.
I know you know things.	Naf li taf affarijiet.
But not for me and for him.	Imma mhux għalija u għalih.
This will not happen again.	Dan mhux se jerġa' jiġri.
It probably should have been.	Probabbilment kellu jkun.
Only that they will make you one.	Biss li dawn ser jagħmlu inti wieħed.
We did well both.	Għamilna tajjeb it-tnejn.
Now let me think.	Issa ħa naħseb.
Many.	Ħafna.
Now, it’s not so bad.	Issa, mhuwiex daqshekk ħażin.
I was going too.	Jien ukoll kont sejjer.
He wanted to drive, but he couldn't.	Ried isuq, imma ma setax.
It was his first.	Kien l-ewwel wieħed tiegħu.
One chance per person.	Ċans wieħed għal kull persuna.
I would be happy to do so.	Inkun kuntent li nagħmel hekk.
I hope you do a better job.	Nistenna li inti tagħmel xogħol aħjar.
He did it.	Huwa għamel dan.
Which is a very difficult thing to do.	Li hija ħaġa diffiċli ħafna li tagħmel.
Well, not so much.	Ukoll, mhux daqshekk.
He got there first.	Huwa wasal hemm l-ewwel.
Obviously.	Ovvjament.
It's not yours anymore.	Mhix tiegħek aktar.
I’m afraid I’ll do something.	Nibża li nagħmel xi ħaġa.
He had no friends there.	Ma kellu l-ebda ħbieb hemmhekk.
I'll tell you what will happen.	Jien ngħidlek x'se jiġri.
It was too late to go back now.	Kien tard wisq biex lura issa.
And this too is there.	U dan ukoll qiegħed hemm.
I can survive.	I jista 'jgħix.
The time to be glad is now.	Iż-żmien li tkun ferħan huwa issa.
That was him.	Dak kien hu.
Who wants to drive?	Min irid isuq?
That’s his whole thing.	Dik hija ħaġa kollha tiegħu.
A friend came to my house.	Ħabib ġie d-dar tiegħi.
Lots of fun to take.	Ħafna gost li wieħed jieħu.
And it was so good for me.	U kien tant tajjeb għalija.
You will be here.	Int tkun hawn.
He didn’t know how much, or how badly.	Ma kienx jaf kemm, jew kemm ħażin.
No, that wasn't good.	Le, dan ma kienx tajjeb.
There was something.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa.
Better to wait a while.	Aħjar li wieħed jistenna ħin.
So is mine.	Hekk ukoll tiegħi.
When it came out, it was really good.	Meta ħareġ, kien tassew tajjeb.
He had.	Kellu.
This is where we are today.	Dan huwa fejn aħna llum.
He was sitting now.	Huwa kien bilqiegħda issa.
Where there is nothing.	Fejn m'hemm xejn.
It is working well with me.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb miegħi.
One he hoped he would never have to do.	Waħda li kien jittama li qatt ma jkollu jagħmel.
We don't have any.	M'għandniex xi.
I have no idea what it is.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'inhu.
He really wanted something more.	Verament ried xi ħaġa aktar.
We know who they are.	Aħna nafu min huma.
This must be done.	Dan irid isir.
I can't believe she's here.	Ma nistax nemmen li hi hawn.
More on that maybe later.	Aktar dwar dan forsi aktar tard.
To know more about it.	Biex tkun taf aktar dwarha.
I thought it was good.	Ħsibt li kien tajjeb.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Ma rridx nitkellem dwarha.
But only one.	Imma wieħed biss.
You must go there with him.	Int trid tmur hemm miegħu.
He looked back.	Huwa ħares lura.
He didn’t want to do that.	Ma riedx jagħmel dan.
It was really easy actually.	Kien verament faċli fil-fatt.
I thought you would be home by now.	Ħsibt li int tkun id-dar sa issa.
That should be more than enough.	Dan għandu jkun aktar minn biżżejjed.
He was getting there.	Kien jasal hemm.
In addition,	Barra minn hekk,
It's working.	Qed jaħdem.
I'm sure not.	Jien ċert li le.
And a beautiful thing.	U ħaġa sabiħa.
That we were, for many years.	Li konna, għal ħafna snin.
And you will.	U int se.
We are not the same.	Aħna mhux l-istess.
I didn’t know when you would be.	Ma kontx naf meta inti tkun.
I'm not happy.	Jien mhux kuntent.
Someone else does.	Xi ħadd ieħor jagħmel.
It was just me.	Kien jien biss.
But fun to think about.	Imma gost taħseb dwarha.
Sometimes, you have to take a chance.	Xi drabi, trid tieħu ċans.
In fact he wanted a lot.	Fil-fatt ried ħafna.
He is not trying.	Hu mhux qed jipprova.
He wanted to be alone.	Ried ikun waħdu.
You know what that is.	Inti taf x'inhu dan.
You know coming, and coming.	Taf li ġej, u ġej.
I don’t know anything about that.	Jien ma naf xejn dwar dan.
I see someone.	Qed nara lil xi ħadd.
It wasn’t there.	Ma kienx hemm.
How easy it is.	Kif ikun faċli.
Probably a lot of time.	Probabbilment ħafna ħin.
And that, my friends, was very good.	U dan, ħbieb tiegħi, kien tajjeb ħafna.
I know you can.	Naf li tista’.
What you need.	Dak li jeħtieġ.
I can't talk to you.	Ma nistax nitkellem miegħek.
And sit down, sit down.	U bilqiegħda, bilqiegħda.
Everything looks good and works well.	Kollox jidher tajjeb u jaħdem tajjeb.
I didn’t know that at the time.	Dak iż-żmien ma kontx naf dan.
Or maybe the next one.	Jew forsi dak ta’ wara.
I did it for him.	Għamilt għalih.
These are people.	Dawn huma nies.
It's there.	Huwa hemmhekk.
I could hear that.	Jien stajt nisma' hekk.
I still have that problem.	Għadni għandi dik il-problema.
Try to do too much.	Jipprova jagħmel wisq.
More on that later.	Aktar dwar dan aktar tard.
But I'm happy now.	Imma jien kuntent issa.
And anyone can do it.	U kulħadd jista 'jagħmel dan.
I didn’t want to think about it.	Ma ridtx taħseb dwarha.
That's right,	Hekk eżatt,
I had to think fast.	Kelli naħseb malajr.
If what you’re doing is working for you, fine.	Jekk dak li qed tagħmel qed jaħdem għalik, tajjeb.
People he needed to see.	Nies li kellu bżonn jara.
It will not do that.	Mhux se tagħmel dan.
Well, so far.	Ukoll, sa issa.
I know what’s good now.	Naf x'inhu tajjeb issa.
He could always say.	Dejjem seta’ jgħid.
You are not back.	M'intix lura.
I really have.	Verament għandi.
I never had.	Qatt ma kelli.
It looked like a lot.	Deher qisu ħafna.
It is not enough.	Mhuwiex biżżejjed.
Only that it is difficult to do so.	Biss li huwa diffiċli li tagħmel hekk.
And that’s me.	U dak jien.
He knew both.	Kien jaf it-tnejn.
You're the first one here.	Int l-ewwel wieħed hawn.
He wasn’t there, but he knows.	Ma kienx hemm, imma jaf.
I can't say when.	Ma nistax ngħid meta.
But it wasn’t so much.	Imma ma kienx daqshekk.
He just came.	Huwa biss daħal.
That's done.	Dak isir.
She did a lot for me.	Hija għamlet ħafna għalija.
It's just there forever.	Huwa biss hemm għal dejjem.
No one could.	Ħadd ma seta’.
But he said it would not happen.	Imma qal li mhux se jiġri.
So many times.	Tant drabi.
Here's my problem.	Hawn il-problema tiegħi.
There was nothing more for him here.	Ma kien hemm xejn aktar għalih hawn.
It could be anything.	Jista 'jkun xi ħaġa.
Everything was too fast.	Kollox kien malajr wisq.
A little more would be great.	Ftit aktar ikun kbir.
I'm still mine.	Għadni tiegħi.
More and more and more.	Aktar u aktar u aktar.
He still didn't know everything about her.	Għadu ma kienx jaf kollox dwarha.
And other things, too.	U affarijiet oħra, ukoll.
It's never too late.	Qatt mhu tard wisq.
I look forward to staying this week.	Nistenna li joqgħod din il-ġimgħa.
I will do something for you.	Nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik.
But he knew what was going to happen.	Imma kien jaf x’kien se jiġri.
It’s still the same.	Għadu l-istess.
Just the truth.	Biss il-verità.
No one expects you to do it all on your own.	Ħadd ma jistenna li tagħmel dan kollu waħdek.
But she is who she is.	Imma hi min hi.
She was so beautiful.	Kienet tant sabiħa.
But not too busy.	Imma mhux okkupat wisq.
But it does.	Imma hekk jagħmel.
I’m sure it wasn’t.	Jiena ċert li ma kienx.
There must be a problem.	Għandu jkun hemm problema.
I knew that for sure.	Jien kont naf li żgur.
This has always been a problem.	Din dejjem kienet problema.
He didn’t want to but he had to.	Ma riedx imma kellu.
And everyone left.	U kulħadd telaq.
You will be.	Int se tkun.
He never said why.	Qatt ma qal għaliex.
I think she is beautiful.	Naħseb li hija sabiħa.
He was very tired, and just wanted to go home.	Kien għajjien ħafna, u ried biss imur id-dar.
But maybe she did.	Imma forsi għamlet.
It never will.	Qatt mhu se.
Only one was working.	Wieħed biss kien qed jaħdem.
Whatever you need.	Tkun xi tkun għandek bżonn.
Like never before.	Bħal qatt ma ġara.
We have a good one.	Għandna waħda tajba.
It came from almost nothing.	Ġie minn kważi xejn.
Not that I was.	Mhux li kont.
There is no other.	M'hemm l-ebda ieħor.
We already have more than one.	Diġà għandna aktar minn wieħed.
He is a man.	Huwa raġel.
But he couldn't say that.	Imma ma setax jgħid hekk.
Too much.	Wisq wisq.
It would be so.	Ikun hekk.
But he knew.	Imma kien jaf.
To know this you don’t need to think.	Biex tkun taf dan m'għandekx bżonn taħseb.
It wasn’t as bad as he first thought.	Ma kienx ħażin daqs kemm ħaseb l-ewwel.
Who wants to.	Li jrid.
Put it back.	Poġġa lura.
Hard to do.	Diffiċli li tagħmel.
You will not be alone.	Inti mhux se tkun waħdu.
And so much was with me.	U ħafna hekk kien miegħi.
That was never a problem.	Dik qatt ma kienet problema.
I can't even.	Jien lanqas biss nista.
I think that could happen.	Naħseb li jista’ jiġri.
Everything can be ready.	Kollox jista’ jkun lest.
Something for tomorrow.	Xi ħaġa għal għada.
Neither did anyone else.	Lanqas ħadd ieħor ma għamel hekk.
I was not happy.	Ma kontx kuntent.
It’s time to go.	Wasal iż-żmien li mmorru.
Come and go.	Jiġi u jmur.
That's mine.	Dak hu tiegħi.
I'm again.	Jien mill-ġdid.
She is not.	Hija ma tkunx.
I saw the book from there.	Rajt il-ktieb minn hemm.
It can't get to you.	Ma jistax jasal għandek.
And so it goes.	U hekk sejjer.
Can anyone do that.	Jista' xi ħadd jagħmel hekk.
Definitely do.	Żgur li jagħmlu.
I have no idea what is going on.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'qed jiġri.
This needs to go.	Dan jeħtieġ li jmur.
It's too early.	Għadu kmieni.
Glad to hear you are taking it easy.	Ferħan li nisma' li qed tieħu faċli.
Will you stay with us ?.	Se toqgħod magħna?.
But that was just me.	Imma dak kont jien biss.
He knew that.	Kien jaf li.
They never did that.	Huma qatt ma kienu jagħmlu hekk.
If this is the case.	Jekk dan hu.
Every single year.	Kull sena waħda.
Well, she had to.	Ukoll, hija kellha.
But here we are.	Imma hawn aħna.
That has already gone enough.	Dan diġà mar biżżejjed.
So be it.	Hekk jerġa’ jkun.
If done right, it really works.	Jekk isir tajjeb, tassew jaħdem.
I understand where it comes from and I want you to be happy.	Nifhem minn fejn ġej u rrid li tkun ferħan.
He was there.	Huwa kien hemm.
And it’s good that you have.	U huwa tajjeb li għandek.
Account.	Kont.
You are more than enough.	Inti aktar minn biżżejjed.
He was not.	Hu ma kienx.
She had never been alone with a child before.	Qatt ma kienet waħedha ma’ tifel qabel.
All or nothing.	Kollox jew xejn.
There is no money.	M'hemm l-ebda flus.
We are each other.	Aħna ta 'xulxin.
One thought I'd like to know.	Wieħed ħsibt li tixtieq tkun taf.
But that’s not what it is.	Imma dan mhuwiex dak li hu.
Let's just go.	Ejja mmorru biss.
I'm ready now.	Jien lest issa.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
Just sitting there.	Biss bilqiegħda hemm.
No, you're back.	Le, inti lura.
Maybe you are a little.	Forsi int xi ftit.
I’m not sure why this is so.	M'inix ċert għaliex dan huwa hekk.
Just tell the truth.	Ngħid il-verità biss.
That’s the first time this has happened.	Dik hija l-ewwel darba li jiġri.
After all.	Wara le.
I needed to talk.	Kelli bżonn nitkellem.
That was good.	Li kien tajjeb.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
Now they have money.	Issa għandhom flus.
But it was not what you think.	Imma ma kienx dak li taħseb.
It was good before that.	Kien tajjeb qabel dan.
I will see if you can do that.	Se nara jekk tistax tagħmel dan.
Better see if it’s home.	Aħjar nara jekk hux id-dar.
Another easy one.	Waħda faċli oħra.
Or talk about it.	Jew titkellem dwarha.
He can't help but look.	Ma jistax jgħin kif jidher.
He goes there.	Huwa jmur hemmhekk.
But we know it will.	Imma nafu li se.
But he had looked.	Imma kien ħares.
It was very early.	Kien kmieni ħafna.
I just wish there was someone else.	Nixtieq biss li jkun hemm xi ħadd ieħor.
For everyone and for everyone here.	Għal kulħadd u għal kulħadd hawn.
Never be he.	Qatt ma jkun hu.
It does too.	Dan jagħmel ukoll.
It looks good to me.	Jidher tajjeb għalija.
He never thought much of me.	Hu qatt ma ħaseb ħafna għalija.
There was a lot to say.	Kien hemm ħafna xi jgħid.
It was a win.	Kien jirbaħ.
He must stay with us.	Għandu jibqa’ magħna.
There was no time for that.	Ma kienx hemm ħin għal dan.
One is not too good.	Wieħed mhux tajjeb wisq.
I know you’re worried about her.	Naf li int inkwetat dwarha.
He did so.	Huwa għamel hekk.
I think it’s too late.	Naħseb li jiġi tard wisq.
As far as I know.	Sa fejn naf jien.
I’m still waiting for that to happen.	Għadu qed nistenna li jiġri hekk.
Someone will do it for you.	Xi ħadd se jagħmel dan għalik.
Tell me.	Għid.
Sure, you’re saying.	Żgur, qed tgħid.
He just hopes it wasn’t him.	Huwa biss jittama li ma kienx hu.
Time to go.	Żmien li mmur.
He is alone there.	Hu waħdu hemm.
I wanted to see you again.	Ridt nerġa’ nara.
You want a lot.	Trid ħafna.
He was here.	Huwa kien hawn.
And they are too easy.	U huma wisq faċli.
This is too bad.	Dan huwa ħażin wisq.
I never did that.	Qatt ma għamilt hekk.
I don’t need a job.	M'għandix bżonn xogħol.
That’s really hard for us.	Dak huwa verament diffiċli għalina.
It was what he wanted.	Kien dak li ried.
You can see it here.	Tista' tara hawn.
Maybe it’s a lot, or maybe not so much.	Forsi huwa ħafna, jew forsi mhux daqshekk.
And we were doing that.	U konna nagħmlu hekk.
But I still need help.	Imma għadni bżonn l-għajnuna.
It's so much more.	Huwa ħafna aktar.
Everyone knows someone.	Kulħadd jaf lil xi ħadd.
And take what you want.	U tieħu dak kif tixtieq.
More than once, perhaps.	Aktar minn darba, forsi.
He didn't even want to have one.	Lanqas ma ried ikollu wieħed.
Everyone went home happy.	Kulħadd mar id-dar ferħan.
Definitely not, he thought.	Żgur li le, ħaseb.
We are so hard !.	Aħna tant diffiċli!.
I didn’t want to really know.	Ma ridtx inkun naf tassew.
If you don’t want to be friends with me, fine.	Jekk ma tridx tkun ħbieb miegħi, tajjeb.
I can't say.	Ma nistax ngħid.
And we are.	U aħna.
Or do some work.	Jew tagħmel xi xogħol.
But there must be another way.	Imma jrid ikun hemm mod ieħor.
So it will be.	Hekk se jkun.
No one had much to say.	Ħadd ma kellu ħafna xi jgħid.
He knew what he looked like.	Kien jaf kif kien jidher.
And we are.	U aħna.
Like he wanted so.	Bħal ried hekk.
He was never so afraid.	Qatt ma kien jibża hekk.
As much as you can.	Kemm tista’.
He was going to talk but he thought better.	Kien se jitkellem imma ħaseb aħjar.
He probably would.	Probabbilment kien se.
And not very good, either.	U mhux tajjeb ħafna, lanqas.
He just said he didn’t want to.	Huwa qal biss li ma riedx.
A little.	Ftit.
I have nothing.	Jien ma għandi xejn.
There is nothing he can do.	Ma jista’ jagħmel xejn.
Ready to go.	Lest biex tmur.
It felt so good, so good.	Ħassu hekk tajjeb, daqshekk tajjeb.
Well now, he thought.	Ukoll issa, ħaseb.
I believe you are.	Nemmen li int.
And it is.	U huwa.
The last thing she needed was that.	L-aħħar ħaġa li kellha bżonn kienet dik.
That's all.	Dak hu biss.
But it doesn’t have to be.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun.
Good to be back !.	Tajjeb li tkun lura!.
I never wanted to do that.	Qatt ma ridt nagħmel dan.
Now you have a problem.	Issa għandek problema.
He was glad he came back.	Kien ferħan li ġie lura.
He didn't know.	Ma kienx jaf.
And that’s not the same thing.	U dik mhix l-istess ħaġa.
I didn’t.	Jien ma kontx.
No one knows what to do.	Ħadd ma jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
I understand why this works.	Nifhem għaliex dan jaħdem.
No one could know.	Ħadd ma seta’ jkun jaf.
Sure, we knew it had to happen.	Żgur, konna nafu li kellu jiġri.
He has just left.	Huwa għadu kif telaq.
It definitely works as well.	Żgur jaħdem ukoll.
This seems to be your home.	Jidher li din hija d-dar tiegħek.
Only.	Biss.
And it was good.	U kien tajjeb.
He should be here by now.	Huwa għandu jkun hawn sa issa.
This is what you want.	Dan huwa dak li trid.
I need a lot.	Għandi bżonn ħafna.
And so it could be.	U hekk jista’ jkun.
You don't want that to happen.	Inti ma tantx trid li jiġri.
It's very good.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna.
She needed to know better.	Hi kellha tkun taf aħjar.
They are nothing.	Huma xejn.
He was not a great man.	Ma kienx raġel kbir.
There has to be some way to do that.	Għandu jkun hemm xi mod kif tagħmel dan.
Is it? 	Huwa?
she says.	hi tgħid.
In my room.	Fil-kamra tiegħi.
It is often difficult to say what you think.	Ħafna drabi jkun diffiċli li tgħid x’qed taħseb.
Not us around.	Mhux magħna madwar.
It's this.	Huwa dan.
I did what I said.	Għamilt dak li għedt.
And really, there is much more.	U tassew, hemm ħafna aktar.
That’s what I did.	Dan għamilt jien.
But one does not have to dwell on this for long.	Imma wieħed m'għandux għalfejn jibqa' fuq dan għal żmien twil.
I think everyone should know this.	Naħseb li kulħadd għandu jkun jaf dan.
Always, never, never.	Dejjem, qatt, qatt.
Not too long ago.	Mhux wisq twil ilu.
It was me.	Huwa kont.
And of course, you are not.	U ovvjament, m'intix.
You wanted to go first.	Int ridt tmur l-ewwel.
It is not working today.	Illum mhux qed jaħdem.
Nobody knew where.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn.
Here’s everything he had to say.	Hawn dak kollu li kellu xi jgħid.
Nobody lives there.	Ħadd ma jgħix hemm.
Here and there.	Hawn u hemm.
I will do something for you.	Jien nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik.
No he won't.	Le hu mhux se.
I think you are one.	Naħseb li inti wieħed.
Come on.	Ejja fuq.
Being alone from everything.	Li tkun waħdu minn kollox.
Not that one, either.	Mhux dik waħda, lanqas.
I have to go back.	Għandi mmur lura.
It is one thing or another.	Hija ħaġa waħda jew oħra.
I’m just telling you something.	Jien biss ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
This is just for us.	Dan huwa biss għalina.
What are you doing? 	X'qed tagħmel?
I don’t want to hear this.	Ma rridx nisma dan.
I know how this.	Naf kif dan.
I'm ready for, he thought.	Jien lest għal, ħaseb.
It could be anything.	Jista 'jkun xejn.
This is not an easy task.	Din mhix xogħol faċli.
There is no way around this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod madwar dan.
I said very little.	għidt ftit li xejn.
He did some things on his own.	Huwa għamel xi affarijiet waħdu.
And he probably died.	U probabbilment miet.
Everyone was going.	Kulħadd kien sejjer.
I did pretty well.	Jien għamilt pjuttost tajjeb.
We were just people.	Konna nies biss.
I go talk to him.	Immur nitkellem miegħu.
No, not just a need.	Le, mhux biss bżonn.
But that’s not what’s happening here.	Imma dan mhux dak li qed jiġri hawn.
If it is not there, nothing will happen.	Jekk ma jkunx hemm, ma jiġri xejn.
He did so quite early.	Għamel hekk pjuttost kmieni.
Before you go, you have things or you don’t have things.	Qabel ma jmur, għandek affarijiet jew m'għandekx affarijiet.
Now, let’s get back to it.	Issa, ejja lura.
And when he came out, he was out of here.	U meta ħareġ, kien barra minn hawn.
Nobody seems to know what's going on.	Ħadd ma jidher li jaf x’inhu jiġri.
It can be anything you want.	Jista 'jkun dak kollu li trid.
This happens often.	Dan jiġri ta' spiss.
It’s a really good job.	Huwa xogħol tassew tajjeb.
Everyone big left.	Kulħadd kbir telaq.
Today he came to my house.	Illum ġie d-dar tiegħi.
But maybe not.	Imma forsi le.
You are alone.	Int waħdek.
Now he’s back.	Issa ġie lura.
There can be more than one way to do this.	Jista 'jkun hemm aktar minn mod wieħed biex tagħmel dan.
That’s not what it does.	Dak mhux dak li jagħmel.
You are doing much better.	Int sejjer ħafna aħjar.
But he is.	Imma hu.
Or just me.	Jew jien biss.
I just want you to know.	Irrid biss li tkun taf.
This is good.	Dan huwa tajjeb.
I have had it many times.	Kelli ħafna darba.
And it is this.	U huwa dan.
It didn't belong to anyone.	Ma kienet ta’ ħadd u ta’ kulħadd.
It was him.	Kien hu.
Everything was as it should be.	Kollox kien kif suppost.
I need to see something.	Għandi bżonn nara xi ħaġa.
I want to love someone.	Irrid inħobb lil xi ħadd.
Not us, not me.	Mhux aħna, mhux jien.
But you’re a busy man.	Imma int raġel okkupat.
In addition, you can do much better.	Barra minn hekk, tista 'tagħmel ħafna aħjar.
It really helps !.	Huwa tassew jgħin!.
And a friend.	U ħabib.
And this my friends, is what you want.	U dan ħbieb tiegħi, huwa dak li trid.
He said he was not.	Huwa qal li ma kienx.
Just over a year ago.	Ftit aktar minn sena ilu.
Well, she knew a lot of people.	Ukoll, kienet taf ħafna nies.
Everything was a bit big.	Kollox kien daqsxejn kbira.
You know everything you need to know.	Taf dak kollu li għandek bżonn tkun taf.
He said it could help.	Huwa qal li jista 'jgħin.
Maybe no one was good enough.	Forsi ħadd ma kien tajjeb biżżejjed.
Let me tell you something.	Ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
He died today.	Miet illum.
I knew my job.	Kont naf ix-xogħol tiegħi.
Pretty much money, actually.	Pjuttost ħafna flus, fil-fatt.
He is coming for me.	Huwa ġej għalija.
It’s still too long.	Għadu żmien twil wisq.
I couldn’t do it anymore.	Ma stajtx nagħmel aktar.
He had a lot of time.	Kellu ħafna ħin.
He died.	Miet.
But tomorrow it will be.	Imma għada jkun.
I don’t know more than you about this.	Jien ma nafx aktar milli int dwar dan.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwar dan.
It’s something we know how to do.	Hija xi ħaġa li nafu kif nagħmlu.
I hope yours goes much better.	Nispera li tiegħek imur ħafna aħjar.
It was going to be good.	Kien se jkun tajjeb.
She knew he was right.	Kienet taf li kellu raġun.
Everyone knew.	Kulħadd kien jaf.
Not where it comes from.	Mhux minn fejn ġej.
She wanted it that way.	Hija kienet tixtieq hekk.
Only the first one.	Biss l-ewwel waħda.
I really never thought about it.	Verament ma kont qatt ħsibt dwarha.
Maybe already we are.	Forsi diġà aħna.
I can’t believe it’s almost here.	Ma nistax nemmen li huwa kważi hawn.
What are you doing today?	X'qed tagħmel illum?
She never really did.	Hija qatt ma verament għamlet.
He had to come.	Kellu jiġi.
I never saw that.	Qatt ma rajt dik.
I wasn't talking to you.	Jien ma kontx qed nitkellem miegħek.
We had had enough.	Kellna biżżejjed.
You don't need to eat until later!	M'għandekx bżonn tiekol sa aktar tard!
Not that there was anything he could do about it.	Mhux li kien hemm xi ħaġa li seta’ jagħmel dwarha.
They are the same.	Huma l-istess.
A long, long time ago.	Żmien twil, twil ilu.
It would be a beautiful one.	Ikun waħda sabiħa.
Enough of that.	Biżżejjed minn hekk.
This we can know.	Dan nistgħu nkunu nafu.
He can do whatever he wants.	Jista’ jagħmel li jrid.
But so it goes.	Imma hekk sejjer.
There may be one long before that.	Jista 'jkun hemm wieħed ħafna qabel dan.
Well that is another.	Ukoll li huwa ieħor.
The book only.	Il-ktieb biss.
.	.
Good if you can't be friends with everyone.	Tajjeb jekk ma tistax tkun ħbieb ma’ kulħadd.
Maybe he was right.	Forsi, kellu raġun.
He was not eating.	Ma kienx qed jiekol.
I don’t know, I’m not one.	Ma nafx, mhux qed wieħed.
It does nothing for me.	Ma jagħmel xejn għalija.
He could not stay here long.	Ma setax jibqa' hawn għal żmien twil.
He didn't want to.	Ma riedx.
I do my thing.	Jien nagħmel ħaġa tiegħi.
Not with him, that's for sure.	Mhux miegħu, dan żgur.
I will say so again.	Ħa ngħid hekk darba oħra.
We want a man like that.	Irridu raġel bħal dan.
This is good.	Dan huwa tajjeb.
Time is so almost up.	Iż-żmien tant kważi sa.
I'm going to buy that.	Jien ser nixtri dak.
He can see what he has to do about it.	Huwa jista 'jidher x'għandu jagħmel dwar dan.
U se.	U se.
I know you can't see everything.	Naf li ma tistax tara kollox.
You must be a man.	Trid tkun raġel.
I had no idea he was going to be here.	Ma kellix idea li kien se jkun hawn.
It's not as hard as it should be.	Mhuwiex diffiċli kemm għandu jkun.
This was not home.	Din ma kinitx id-dar.
A little too good.	Ftit wisq tajjeb.
I'm afraid of anything good.	Nibża' xejn tajjeb.
I can see and hear.	Qed nara u nisma’.
Well, too bad for you.	Ukoll, ħażin wisq għalik.
I hope someone can help.	Nispera li xi ħadd jista 'jgħin.
He just doesn’t know.	Hu biss ma jafx.
She's supposed to be back tomorrow.	Hi suppost tkun lura għada.
How much fun.	Kemm gost.
He wasn’t having any of that.	Ma kien qed ikollu xejn minn dan.
This is where we want to be.	Dan huwa fejn irridu nkunu.
We don't know what happened.	Ma tantx nafu x’ġara.
There will be more tomorrow and tomorrow.	Ikun hemm aktar għada u għada.
Glad I went.	Ferħan li mort.
It was for a while.	Kien għal xi żmien.
I heard so too.	Smajt hekk ukoll.
Maybe it really was.	Forsi hekk kien verament.
I don't want to see anyone.	Ma rrid nara lil ħadd.
It had happened to me.	Kien ġara lili.
You need to know.	Jeħtieġ li tkun taf.
I never expect you to.	Qatt ma nistenna li int.
Please try again later.	Jekk jogħġbok, ipprova aktar tard.
I hope it was good for you too.	Nispera li kien tajjeb għalik ukoll.
I know you were a good friend.	Naf li kont qed tkun ħabib tajjeb.
I better go now.	Aħjar immur issa.
I was not able to see very well.	Ma kontx kapaċi nara tajjeb ħafna.
Towards the end, there seemed to be things.	Lejn l-aħħar, jidher li kien hemm affarijiet.
He was a good man.	Kien raġel tajjeb.
He wants another boy, and so on.	Irid tifel ieħor, u hekk.
And now, one more thing before you go.	U issa, ħaġa waħda oħra qabel ma tmur.
I’m not going to tell you anything about it.	Jien mhu se ngħidlek xejn dwarha.
He would do that.	Kien jagħmel hekk.
I want to do more.	Irrid nagħmel aktar.
But there was no time for that.	Imma ma kienx hemm ħin għal dan.
We knew who we were.	Konna nafu min konna.
It's easy to make and good as well.	Huwa faċli li tagħmel u tajjeb ukoll.
I was like that.	Jien kont hekk.
But really not a big deal.	Imma verament mhux xi ħaġa kbira.
I couldn’t believe it.	Ma stajtx nemmen li.
Has anyone seen anything like this ?.	Xi ħadd ra xi ħaġa bħal din?.
He said it well.	Huwa qal tajjeb.
Along with mine.	Flimkien ma' tiegħi.
But it could have been someone.	Imma seta’ kien xi ħadd.
I don’t know anything about that.	Jien ma naf xejn dwar dan.
No, it's still nothing.	Le, għadu xejn.
Don’t talk to him unless you want to.	M'għandekx titkellem miegħu sakemm ma tridx.
I also go home.	Jien ukoll immur id-dar.
Or it never seemed to come out.	Jew qatt ma deher li ħareġ.
He is not coming.	Hu mhux ġej.
But you go.	Imma int tmur.
I’ve never seen this, before.	Qatt ma rajt dan, qabel.
And no one has ever seen this.	U ħadd qatt ma ra dan.
I don’t think she did.	Ma naħsibx li għamlet.
What you have to do is.	Dak li għandek tagħmel hu.
More likely, in fact.	Aktar probabbli, fil-fatt.
I don’t have to tell you.	M'għandix għalfejn ngħidlek.
We want to do the same easy thing for you.	Irridu nagħmlu l-istess ħaġa faċli għalik.
I want to know about that someone.	Irrid inkun naf dwar dak xi ħadd.
I'm not out.	I mhux barra.
I was never there.	Qatt ma kont hemm.
But other people will.	Imma nies oħra se.
There were a few.	Kien hemm ftit.
It was almost unnecessary.	Kien kważi bla bżonn.
It happens more and more.	Jiġri dejjem aktar.
But it wasn’t and it wasn’t.	Imma ma kinitx u ma kinitx.
He had done a lot.	Huwa kien għamel ħafna.
Don't have time.	M'għandekx ħin.
As much as you want.	Kemm trid.
She never had and never will.	Qatt ma kellha u qatt ma se.
But you had no way of knowing this.	Imma ma kellek l-ebda mod kif tkun taf dan.
Here's what to do.	Hawn dak li għandek tagħmel.
I try to be there early.	Nipprova nkun hemm kmieni.
I just don't know how to do it.	I biss ma nafx kif tagħmel dan.
I saw what was happening.	Rajt x’kien qed jiġri.
And it’s really pretty easy to know.	U hija verament pjuttost faċli li tkun taf.
I wanted it to be better.	Ridt li jkun aħjar.
That’s all anyone ever sees.	Dak hu dak kollu li xi ħadd qatt jara.
Definitely someone.	Żgur li hu xi ħadd.
Not for nothing.	Mhux għal xejn.
Maybe he would go.	Forsi kien imur.
I'll be back soon.	Jien ser inkun lura dalwaqt.
Only that is not working, and will not work.	Biss dak mhux qed jaħdem, u mhux se jaħdem.
You have done this before.	Inti għamilt dan qabel.
Very so.	Ħafna hekk.
I wonder how long it has been there.	Nistaqsi kemm ilu hemm.
I don't know where it could be.	Ma nafx fejn jista’ jkun.
But it's not there yet.	Imma għadu mhux hemm.
Or he thought he had.	Jew ħaseb li kellu.
Well, maybe school.	Ukoll, forsi l-iskola.
He couldn’t think about it now.	Ma setax jaħseb dwar dan issa.
Well, there is.	Ukoll, hemm.
I need work.	Għandi bżonn ix-xogħol.
I know.	Kont naf.
It’s usually easy to tell.	Normalment huwa faċli li tgħid.
None of this is certain.	Xejn minn dan mhu żgur.
It's too early to tell.	Huwa wisq kmieni biex tgħid.
I think it will be soon.	Naħseb li se jkun dalwaqt.
That's all.	Dan huwa kollu.
This will make your job much, much easier.	Dan se jagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħek ħafna, ħafna aktar faċli.
I’ve been there before.	Jien kont hemm qabel.
I don't know what happened to me.	Ma nafx x’ġara miegħi.
You did very well.	Int għamilt tajjeb ħafna.
I saw it!	Rajt li!
He looks so small.	Huwa jidher daqshekk żgħir.
He has his.	Huwa għandu tiegħu.
He wanted to live.	Ried jgħix.
I love work.	Inħobb ix-xogħol.
Maybe she's here.	Forsi hi hawn.
But she didn't know why.	Imma ma kinitx taf għaliex.
And here it is.	U hawn hu.
Not much time.	Mhux ħafna ħin.
I can’t be sure about that.	Ma nistax inkun ċert dwar dan.
He was tired, so tired.	Kien għajjien, tant għajjien.
We can do whatever you want.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dak kollu li trid.
I really couldn’t take this much anymore.	I verament ma stajtx tieħu dan ħafna aktar.
It is either there or it is not.	Huwa jew hemm jew ma jkunx.
So much for that.	Tant għal dan.
It does that.	Dan jagħmel dan.
I thought it was going to go away.	Ħsibt li se jmur.
We have to go.	Għandna mmorru.
No, it must be something else.	Le, trid tkun xi ħaġa oħra.
It seems like we're a big deal here.	Jidher li aħna ħaġa kbira hawn.
I never had to tell you that.	Qatt ma kelli ngħidlek hekk.
I know that, now.	Naf li, issa.
He knew nothing.	Ma kien jaf xejn.
This was not to be.	Dan ma kellux ikun.
What I think is what he is trying to do.	Li naħseb huwa dak li qed jipprova jagħmel.
Nothing does anything.	Xejn ma jagħmel xejn.
Now they were back, and we knew how it would be.	Issa kienu lura, u konna nafu kif se jkun.
Maybe there is no way they should.	Forsi m'hemm l-ebda mod kif għandhom.
No, now he could not speak.	Le, issa ma setax jitkellem.
This is not really a good idea.	Din mhix fil-fatt idea tajba.
But it needs to be so no more.	Imma jeħtieġ li jkun hekk mhux aktar.
He was not wearing anything as he usually was.	Ma kien liebes xejn kif kien normalment.
he asked.	staqsa.
No one does that anymore.	Ħadd ma jagħmel hekk aktar.
This was going to be difficult.	Dan kien se jkun diffiċli.
Mine and yours.	Tiegħi u tiegħek.
I’m tired and too busy.	Jien għajjien u okkupat wisq.
Well, here you are.	Ukoll, hawn int.
I thought it was going to be great.	Ħsibt li se jkun kbir.
As you say, it was often not what it seemed.	Kif tgħid, ħafna drabi ma kienx dak li kien jidher.
Great, what he needed.	Kbir, dak li kellu bżonn.
And have fun.	U tieħu gost.
Not a bad idea.	Mhux idea ħażina.
Not out yet.	Għadu mhux barra.
This comes first.	Dan jiġi qabel kollox.
I'm not sure, really.	M'inix ċert, tassew.
I thought we were friends.	Ħsibt li konna ħbieb.
That's what he wanted.	Hekk ried.
Surely it was ahead of its time.	Żgur li kien qabel iż-żmien tiegħu.
Everyone knows by now.	Kulħadd jaf sa issa.
I didn’t want to talk.	Ma ridtx nitkellem.
So will everyone.	Hekk se kulħadd.
You and you just will.	Int u int biss se.
That’s all he can do.	Dan huwa dak kollu li jista 'jagħmel.
Or talk about it.	Jew titkellem dwarha.
Who knows you are with us.	Min jaf li int magħna.
I'm sure not.	Jien ċert li le.
Nothing will do.	Xejn se tagħmel.
He prayed for you.	Huwa talab għalik.
There is nothing we can do.	M'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu.
Or maybe.	Jew forsi.
I'm still not.	Jien għadni ma.
Now you know better.	Issa taf aħjar.
Everyone seemed happy.	Kulħadd deher kuntent.
It's so big.	Huwa daqshekk kbir.
It will be fun.	Se jieħu gost.
He went further.	Huwa mar aktar.
But what happened, happened.	Imma dak li ġara, ġara.
Or maybe it was just me.	Jew forsi kont jien biss.
Maybe he was seeing someone else.	Forsi kien qed jara lil xi ħadd ieħor.
That's wrong.	Dak hu ħażin.
And so we did.	U hekk konna nagħmlu.
Maybe that was the problem.	Forsi dik kienet il-problema.
He will be.	Huwa se jkun.
Or now.	Jew issa.
That's easier.	Dak aktar faċli.
He prayed for you.	Huwa talab għalik.
So it must be.	Hekk għandu jkun.
Do you think you can eat like that?	Taħseb li tista' tiekol hekk?.
I know what happened, and so do you.	Naf x’ġara, u int ukoll.
I saw that.	Rajt dak.
I don't know.	ma nafx.
But you really would be fine.	Imma int verament tkun tajjeb.
I will not do that.	Jien mhux se nagħmel dan.
He was not home yet.	Għadu ma kienx id-dar.
I did a lot of work today.	Għamilt ħafna xogħol illum.
But that’s what’s happening here.	Imma dak hu li qed jiġri hawn.
You too.	Int ukoll.
I know everything.	Naf kollox.
I am supposed to know better.	I suppost naf aħjar.
I'm really doing this.	Jien verament qed nagħmel dan.
he asked.	staqsa.
I have now.	Għandi issa.
All these, and more.	Dawn kollha, u aktar.
She can do better than that.	Hija tista 'tagħmel aħjar minn hekk.
But no help.	Imma l-ebda għajnuna.
It just happened on its own.	Ġara biss waħdu.
He thought so.	Huwa ħaseb hekk.
Like now.	Bħal issa.
When you want to do something do it.	Meta trid tagħmel xi ħaġa tagħmel dan.
I just wanted someone else to know.	Ridt biss li xi ħadd ieħor ikun jaf.
He was here.	Huwa kien hawn.
But that may not be so bad.	Imma din tista 'ma tkunx ħaġa daqshekk ħażina.
I hope you are back.	Nispera li tkun lura.
I will never go back.	Qatt mhu se mmorru lura.
That’s not a problem.	Dik mhix problema.
Not too late for us.	Mhux tard wisq għalina.
It’s right behind that house.	Huwa eżatt wara dik id-dar.
How are you going.	Kif sejjer.
But he.	Imma hu.
I see nothing more we can do now.	Ma nara xejn aktar li nistgħu nagħmlu issa.
Maybe he can't.	Forsi ma jistax.
Now you know.	Issa taf.
I was surprised too.	Kont sorpriż wisq.
I’ve seen it coming from here.	Stajt nara li ġej minn hawn.
You may not be able to.	Inti tista 'ma tkunx kapaċi.
She can't do that.	Hija ma tistax tagħmel dan.
He should know.	Huwa għandu jkun jaf.
I can see everything, I can hear everything.	Nista’ nara kollox, nisma’ kollox.
I don’t even have a place to live.	Lanqas għandi fejn noqgħod.
I was just surprised he was with us.	Kont biss sorpriż li kien magħna.
Someone had.	Xi ħadd kellu.
It really doesn't.	Huwa verament ma.
Not me.	Mhux lili.
I knew he knew this too.	Kont naf li kien jaf dan ukoll.
We have to go now.	Għandna mmorru issa.
And that would be it.	U dan ikun.
It's pretty easy.	Huwa pjuttost faċli.
This can help.	Dan jista 'jgħin.
He didn't want to talk.	Ma riedx jitkellem.
Maybe there is an easier way.	Forsi hemm mod aktar faċli.
I thought it might work.	Ħsibt li jista 'jaħdem.
I couldn’t think of anything that would be enough.	Ma stajt naħseb xi ħaġa li tkun biżżejjed.
I tell you that happens.	Jien ngħidlek li jiġri.
Come on, everyone.	Ejja, kulħadd.
Better that way than nothing.	Aħjar hekk milli xejn.
So be it.	Hekk suppost tkun.
But little has been done.	Imma ftit sar.
Well you are right.	Ukoll għandek raġun.
I thought there was no need.	Ħsibt li ma kienx hemm bżonn.
No one really wants anyone to know who they really are.	Ħadd ma jrid verament li xi ħadd ikun jaf min hu verament.
No one could say what happened.	Ħadd ma seta’ jgħid x’ġara.
Really? 	Tassew?
I said.	għidt.
I wait, I wait, and I wait a little longer.	Nistenna, nistenna, u nistenna ftit aktar.
Everyone leaves here.	Kulħadd jitlaq minn hawn.
He will not come.	Hu mhux se jiġi.
I just loved everything he did.	I biss iħobb dak kollu li għamel.
Maybe that was good.	Forsi dan kien tajjeb.
I don't want to hear that.	Ma rridx nisma' hekk.
But try it.	Imma ipprova.
It's a lot of work.	Huwa ħafna xogħol.
I actually went there.	Fil-fatt mort hemm.
You were small.	Inti kont żgħir.
She is doing well too.	Hija qed tagħmel tajjeb ukoll.
He wanted to know what it was.	Ried ikun jaf x’kien.
We did a lot today.	Għamilna ħafna llum.
But there was a problem with that.	Imma kien hemm problema b'dan.
He was alone.	Huwa kien waħdu.
I can't say anything about that.	Ma nista’ ngħid xejn dwar dan.
I'm not ready to talk to you yet.	Għadni m'inix lest li nitkellem miegħek.
You eat too much.	Tiekol wisq.
How are you doing here?	Kif tmur hawn?
I don't have anyone.	M’għandi lil ħadd.
Le le le.	Le le le.
There wasn’t much.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna.
It was more than that, much more.	Kien aktar minn hekk, ħafna aktar.
Not so with me.	Mhux hekk miegħi.
I wasn’t interested in anything.	Jien ma kont interessat xejn.
Not that he has much.	Mhux li għandu ħafna.
And he knew so much about so much.	U kien jaf tant dwar tant.
This was not as easy as he had thought.	Dan ma kienx faċli li tagħmel kif kien ħaseb.
Everything went well.	Kollox mar tajjeb.
Which she did.	Li hi għamlet.
Everything is working.	Kollox qed jaħdem.
Now, there I am.	Issa, hemm jien.
They felt good.	Ħassu tajjeb.
It is, and will be.	Huwa, u se jkun.
I want you to do what you want to do.	Irrid li tagħmel dak li trid tagħmel.
I don’t know where he is right now.	Ma nafx fejn qiegħed bħalissa.
Maybe that would be you too.	Forsi dik tkun int ukoll.
I’ve been sitting for hours.	Stajt noqgħod għal sigħat.
And it's wrong.	U huwa ħażin.
That he had done it.	Li kien għamel dan.
I'm not sure.	Miniex ċert.
He wasn’t even trying.	Lanqas ma kien qed jipprova.
But there can be nothing.	Imma ma jista’ jkun hemm xejn.
Neither do I.	Jien lanqas.
We did a good job.	Għamilna xogħol tajjeb.
Never, never happened.	Qatt, qatt ma ġara.
You can do the same thing.	Tista 'tagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
I want you to come, too.	Irrid li inti tiġi, ukoll.
Me too.	Jien ukoll.
I loved it.	Jien kont inħobb.
You can't eat anything.	Ma tistax tiekol xejn.
I had the same problem.	Kelli l-istess problema.
I'm not.	Jien le.
But it was too late to do anything about it.	Imma kien tard wisq biex tagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
And someone did.	U xi ħadd għamel.
You want more people tonight.	Trid aktar nies illejla.
Not even that.	Lanqas dan.
But neither was it.	Imma lanqas ma kien hekk.
You will be fine.	Inti tkun tajjeb.
In fact, she didn’t know what that was.	Fil-fatt, hija ma kinitx taf x'kien dan.
Please tell another.	Jekk jogħġbok għid ieħor.
We never did.	Aħna qatt ma.
Soon, everyone is having a great time.	Dalwaqt, kulħadd qed ikollu ħin tajjeb ħafna.
You only have to do this once.	Għandek tagħmel dan darba biss.
We had known each other for a long time.	Konna nafu lil xulxin għal żmien twil.
You take a lot of people with you.	Inti tieħu ħafna nies miegħek.
You can do more than you think.	Tista 'tagħmel aktar milli taħseb.
I know he is my friend.	Naf li hu ħabib tiegħi.
Glad to hear your say !.	Ferħan li nisma' tgħid tiegħek!.
I hope it goes well.	Nispera li sejjer tajjeb.
He was ready.	Huwa kien lest.
And it never will.	U qatt mhu se.
He says everything will be fine.	Jgħid kollox se jkun tajjeb.
I did that.	Jien għamilt dik.
He didn't know.	Hu ma kienx jaf.
Come on, he said.	Ejja, qal.
You will do this first.	Int se tagħmel dan l-ewwel.
This is working well.	Dan qed jaħdem tajjeb.
This is a must see.	Din hija trid tara.
But we don't.	Imma aħna ma.
And it never was.	U qatt ma kienet.
He wanted to go fast.	Ried imur malajr.
We are both.	Aħna t-tnejn.
Or a good one with me.	Jew wieħed tajjeb miegħi.
Not better.	Mhix aħjar.
No! 	Le!
Here's the same.	Hawn l-istess.
Usually I came here alone.	Normalment ġejt hawn waħdi.
I just couldn't do it.	I biss ma stajtx tagħmel dan.
You know you can't.	Taf li ma tistax.
It's really great.	Huwa verament kbir.
Everything was one.	Kollox kien wieħed.
Little by little, he began to speak.	Ftit ftit, beda jitkellem.
Obviously it is happening.	Ovvjament qed jiġri.
I'm not ready now.	Jien mhux lest issa.
He is there all the time.	Huwa hemm il-ħin kollu.
And with that, you did nothing.	U b'dan, inti ma għamilt xejn.
I can't ask.	Ma nistax nistaqsi.
So do a lot of people.	Hekk jagħmlu ħafna nies.
I think you can do that.	Naħseb li tista 'tagħmel dan.
I love doing my job.	Inħobb nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi.
Not much more now.	Mhux wisq aktar issa.
It's great.	Huwa kbir.
This is your last chance.	Dan huwa l-aħħar ċans tiegħek.
Only one thing.	Ħaġa waħda biss.
Nobody here.	Ħadd hawn.
You don’t want to know why someone did something.	Ma tridx tkun taf għaliex xi ħadd għamel xi ħaġa.
And it was very difficult for me.	U kien diffiċli ħafna għalija.
As you say.	Kif tgħid.
It's still morning	Għadu filgħodu
You really don't.	Int verament ma.
Unless it was.	Sakemm ma kienx.
I want you to know that it's not you.	Irrid li tkun taf li mhux int.
That's what happened.	Hekk ġara.
But, really, nothing is.	Imma, tassew, xejn ikun.
If there was anything better.	Kieku kien hemm xi ħaġa aħjar.
I’m really happy with that.	Jien tassew kuntent b'dan.
Come on, come on.	Ejja, ejja.
Everything, and nothing.	Kollox, u xejn.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
And she's good.	U hi tajba.
But it was not always so.	Imma mhux dejjem kien hekk.
So said the book.	Hekk kien qal il-ktieb.
Do you want this too ?.	Tixtieq dan ukoll?.
You think a lot about it.	Taħseb ħafna dwarha.
If it is not already.	Jekk ma jkunx diġà.
I’m not so surprised.	Jien mhux daqshekk sorpriż.
John is a good friend.	John huwa ħabib tajjeb.
I say yours.	Jien ngħid tiegħek.
But he would come back.	Imma kien jiġi lura.
I do nothing.	Jien ma nagħmel xejn.
lost, of course.	tilef, ovvjament.
It doesn't have to be.	M’għandux għalfejn ikun.
It could have been there.	Seta’ kien hemm.
I have to go back there.	Ikolli mmur lura hemm.
There is always back.	Dejjem ikun hemm lura.
This is my friend.	Dan huwa ħabib tiegħi.
Nothing they are, actually.	Xejn huma, fil-fatt.
It looks so bad.	Jidher daqshekk ħażin.
But more than that.	Imma aktar minn hekk.
For me it’s not that big.	Għalija mhuwiex daqshekk kbir.
She knew nothing more.	Ma kienet taf xejn aktar.
I was nothing to him.	Jien ma kont xejn għalih.
I'm not sure.	Ma nafx żgur.
I won’t talk to you much anymore.	Jien mhux se nitkellem miegħek ħafna aktar.
Very good, very good.	Tajjeb ħafna, tajjeb ħafna.
I'm sure he does with you.	Jien ċert li jagħmel miegħek.
I'm glad he left.	Jien ferħan li mar.
And, it’s wrong.	U, huwa ħażin.
But she didn’t know it.	Imma hi ma kinitx taf dan.
It was definitely better than before.	Żgur li kien aħjar minn qabel.
Nor good.	U lanqas tajjeb.
He wasn’t sure why he was coming.	Ma kienx ċert għaliex kien jiġi.
It comes to him.	Jiġi għalih.
It just wasn't his.	Biss ma kienx tiegħu.
You are where you want to be.	Inti fejn trid tkun.
If you want.	Jekk trid.
.	.
No one needed it.	Ħadd ma kellu bżonn.
Are you ready to go?	Inti lest biex tmur?
I’m not trying to say something like that.	M'iniex nipprova ngħid xi ħaġa bħal din.
She says it will be the last time.	Tgħid li tkun l-aħħar darba.
I want you to be better than me.	Irrid li tkun aħjar minni.
And do things.	U tagħmel affarijiet.
Where did this start? 	Kieku beda dan?
Something about it.	Xi ħaġa dwarha.
This wasn’t even saying much.	Dan lanqas ma kien qed jgħid ħafna.
And so we did.	U hekk għamilna aħna.
They are me.	Huma jien.
You can, but not me.	Tista’, imma mhux jien.
I just want to be sure.	Irrid inkun ċert biss.
You want to go back.	Trid tmur lura.
I’m not just saying that.	Jien mhux biss ngħid dan.
That was so good.	Dan kien tant tajjeb.
It must be you.	Trid tkun int.
I want it to be.	Nixtieq li tiġi.
We had no time to do anything for a long time.	Ma kellna l-ebda ħin biex nagħmlu xejn għal żmien twil.
I came here to.	Ġejt hawn biex.
How does he do it?	Kif jagħmel dan?
How long has he been dead?	Kemm ilu li miet?
But he had done well.	Imma kien għamel tajjeb.
I can’t quite tomorrow.	Ma nistax pjuttost għada.
Only, it wasn't.	Biss, ma kienx.
I'm not going.	Jien mhux se mmur.
I knew that now.	Jien kont naf li issa.
I looked good.	Jien deher tajjeb.
I'm with you here.	Jien miegħek hawn.
I think maybe I’m hearing something.	Naħseb li forsi qed nisma xi ħaġa.
I would be able to say.	Inkun kapaċi ngħid.
This dog was alone.	Dan il-kelb kien waħdu.
I have definitely done this before.	Żgur li għamilt dan qabel.
It would be great to see this.	Ikun kbir li tara dan.
He couldn’t have.	Ma setax ikollu.
Everything we did together.	Dak kollu li għamilna flimkien.
As long as there is.	Sakemm ikun hemm.
You were right about one thing.	Kellek raġun dwar ħaġa waħda.
I know better.	Naf aħjar.
So much to say.	Tant xi ngħid.
There was no one about.	Ma kien hemm ħadd dwar.
Everyone is talking about it.	Kulħadd jitkellem dwarha.
Plus, you can’t do that.	Barra minn hekk, ma tistax tagħmel dan.
But that was not what happened.	Imma dan ma kienx dak li ġara.
I just wanted size.	Ridt daqs biss.
Well, you will see.	Ukoll, se tara.
In addition,	Barra minn hekk,
I'm here for you.	Jien hawn għalik.
He is a great man.	Huwa raġel kbir.
It was his.	Kienet tiegħu.
That was the first one for us.	Dik kienet l-ewwel waħda għalina.
Well, that's my job.	Ukoll, dak huwa xogħol tiegħi.
I was pretty busy.	Kont pjuttost okkupat.
Not so mine.	Mhux hekk tiegħi.
Now he was going.	Issa kien sejjer.
I don't want to.	Ma rridx.
But all for nothing.	Imma dan kollu għal xejn.
You don’t want to know, he says.	Inti ma tridx li tkun taf, huwa jgħid.
I'm really late.	Jien verament tard.
I really want him to come back.	Nixtieq tassew li jerġa’ lura.
That would be good.	Dan ikun tajjeb.
You have little time.	Għandek ftit ħin.
That was good too.	Dan kien tajjeb wisq.
Everyone was there.	Kulħadd kien hemm.
He didn't want to talk.	Ma riedx jitkellem.
And so it is.	U hekk hu.
That was just the first thing.	Dik kienet l-ewwel ħaġa biss.
That was the only way he could think of it.	Dak kien l-uniku mod kif seta’ jaħseb dwarha.
So too is he not here.	Hekk ukoll hu mhux hawn.
I say three hours.	Jien ngħid tliet sigħat.
I couldn’t ask about another man.	Ma stajtx nistaqsi dwar raġel ieħor.
Until then I will be long.	Sa dak iż-żmien ser inkun twil.
There was no one around.	Ma kien hemm ħadd madwar.
So it was, he saw now.	Hekk kien, ra issa.
We need some time.	Għandna bżonn ftit ħin.
There is.	Hemm .
But it shouldn’t.	Imma m'għandux.
But now, he wanted more.	Imma issa, ried aktar.
But we did it.	Imma għamilna dan.
These are just things.	Dawn l-affarijiet huma biss.
So would many other people.	Hekk kieku ħafna nies oħra.
Not a big deal.	Mhix ħaġa kbira.
Some people are like that.	Xi nies huma hekk.
Also, this has just come out today.	Barra minn hekk, dan għadu kif ħareġ illum.
I wish I could.	Nixtieq li jista’.
Not sure why it's not working.	Mhux ċert għaliex mhux qed jaħdem.
I want to hear everything.	Irrid nisma kollox.
The dog was friendly.	Il-kelb kien faċli.
Work as good as yours.	Xogħol tajjeb daqs tiegħek.
I’m not saying it will happen.	Mhux qed ngħid li se jiġri.
You either have it or you don’t.	Inti jew għandek jew m'għandekx.
I just thought maybe he knew this dog.	Ħsibt biss li forsi kien jaf lil dan il-kelb.
He didn’t know what to do, either.	Hu ma kienx jaf x'għandu jagħmel, lanqas.
Let’s do a little more than that.	Ejja ftit aktar minn dak.
He couldn't either.	Lanqas seta’.
And on.	U fuq.
I can go in the morning, if you want.	Nista’ mmur filgħodu, jekk trid.
Well, it will do as well.	Ukoll, se jagħmel kif ukoll ieħor.
We don’t have much time.	M'għandniex ħafna ħin.
I couldn’t do any wrong.	Ma stajt nagħmel l-ebda ħażin.
There is someone here.	Hemm xi ħadd hawn.
It shouldn’t be happening.	M'għandux ikun qed jiġri.
He always says so.	Dejjem jgħid hekk.
It's pretty big.	Huwa pjuttost kbir.
She did so too often.	Hija għamlet hekk spiss wisq.
I will only be here for a year.	Se nkun hawn biss għal sena.
But they are.	Imma huma.
And it could be anything.	U jista 'jkun xi ħaġa.
I said he should buy one.	Għidt li għandu jixtri wieħed.
I just did work.	Jien għamilt xogħol biss.
You know what’s out there.	Taf x'hemm hemmhekk.
This is just a lot harder than it looks.	Dan huwa biss ħafna aktar diffiċli milli jidher.
I was there.	Jien kont hemm.
I don’t do that.	Jien ma nagħmel dan.
That’s really it.	Dak hu tassew.
They were better.	Kienu aħjar.
It's been a long time coming.	Ilu żmien twil ġej.
I think everyone sees this.	Naħseb li kulħadd jara dan.
This was going to take a lot of work.	Dan kien se jieħu ħafna xogħol.
I’m going to have so much fun.	Jien ser nieħu gost daqshekk.
I need this.	Għandi bżonn dan.
It was something more.	Kienet xi ħaġa aktar.
It's as good as it gets.	Huwa tajjeb daqs kemm hu.
It just becomes too much of a good thing.	Biss isir wisq ta 'ħaġa tajba.
He is not sure what to think.	Huwa mhux ċert x'għandu jaħseb.
It was always late.	Dejjem kienet tard.
This should help a lot.	Dan għandu jgħin ħafna.
For a long time he has been thinking these things.	Għal żmien twil ilu jaħseb dawn l-affarijiet.
It could have been a big job for him.	Seta’ kien xogħol kbir għalih.
There is nothing you can do.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel.
No, it wasn't me.	Le, ma kontx jien.
Nista.	Nista.
Everything we have, you have, too.	Dak kollu li għandna, inti għandek, ukoll.
I have often seen this happen.	Ħafna drabi kont rajt dan jiġri.
I have this.	Ikolli dan.
I’ve never really been there before.	Jien qatt ma kont verament hemm qabel.
I was too young.	Kont żgħir wisq.
I thought about where I should go.	Ħsibt fejn għandi mmur.
Time is running out.	Iż-żmien verament imur malajr.
Sure enough, it was.	Żgur biżżejjed, kien.
I can't see anything.	Ma nista’ nara xejn.
Maybe, but not quickly.	Forsi, imma mhux malajr.
It was the same thing now.	Kienet l-istess ħaġa issa.
And she would.	U hi kieku.
For, like, the same time.	Għal, bħal, l-istess ħin.
I couldn't eat.	Ma stajtx niekol.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Int żgur li trid tagħmel dan?
Lots of time.	Ħafna ħin.
You know it is.	Taf li se.
He can see too much.	Jista’ jara wisq.
It was done before.	Sar qabel.
You must be too tired.	Trid tkun għajjien wisq.
I could understand that.	Jien stajt nifhem dan.
I need to do something.	Għandi bżonn li tagħmel xi ħaġa.
He died just as he wanted.	Miet eżatt kif ried.
No, he was a man.	Le, kien raġel.
That was all he needed.	Dan kien biss dak li kellu bżonn.
He couldn’t work where he was.	Ma setax jaħdem fejn kien.
The problem was that he was right.	Il-problema kienet li kellu raġun.
This house is great.	Din id-dar hija kbira.
Another went, and another.	Ieħor mar, u ieħor.
And I'm happy.	U jien kuntent.
No one is there, either.	Ħadd hemm, lanqas.
Not a single child died today.	Illum ma miet tifel wieħed.
It's noon.	Huwa nofsinhar.
And maybe you are one.	U forsi inti wieħed.
If she ever does.	Jekk hi qatt tagħmel.
What are you doing?	X'inhi tagħmel?
I'm here with you.	Jien hawn miegħek.
Everyone in the room knew what had happened.	Kulħadd fil-kamra kien jaf x’kien ġara.
Maybe he's right.	Forsi għandu raġun.
I will be fine.	Jien se nkun tajjeb.
I was not able to understand why.	Ma kontx kapaċi nifhem għaliex.
I did a pretty good job.	Għamilt xogħol pjuttost tajjeb.
But he didn't, he never could.	Imma hu ma, qatt ma seta '.
You just know.	Int biss taf.
I'm happy today.	Jien kuntent illum.
But that’s not likely out here.	Imma dak mhux probabbli hawn barra.
But there is something else.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
Each for himself.	Kull wieħed għalih.
Looks like you're actually there.	Qisu int fil-fatt hemm.
You have to do it.	Trid tagħmel dan.
That was one.	Dik kienet waħda.
But there was something else wrong.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra ħażina.
There must be.	Għandu jkun hemm.
And you too.	U int ukoll.
It was coming.	Kien ġej.
You have enough.	Għandek biżżejjed.
That was good for me.	Dak kien tajjeb miegħi.
I am not a little in the morning.	Jiena m'iniex xi ftit filgħodu.
But he couldn’t go back.	Imma ma setax imur lura.
For me, it’s something else.	Għalija, hija xi ħaġa oħra.
Someone was always in the room with him.	Xi ħadd kien dejjem fil-kamra miegħu.
It will not happen again.	Mhux se jerġa’ jiġri.
Like what was about to happen.	Bħal dak li wasal biex jiġri.
There is nothing for us out there.	M'hemm xejn għalina hemmhekk.
Or both.	Jew it-tnejn.
I need to go soon.	Għandi bżonn immur dalwaqt.
Sorry, though.	Jiddispjaċini, imma.
Not once.	Mhux darba.
I hope we never are.	Nittama li qatt ma nkunu hekk.
He knows it’s not right for him.	Jaf li mhux tajjeb għalih.
But this may be going a little too far.	Imma dan jista 'jkun qed imur ftit wisq.
This is working well.	Dan qed jaħdem tajjeb.
We don't need much.	M’għandniex bżonn ħafna.
I never want to do anything else.	Qatt ma nixtieq li tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
And now this.	U issa dan.
I never wanted to, you know.	Qatt ma ridt, taf.
But not to each other.	Imma mhux lil xulxin.
Anyone who talks to him is saying he has this very wrong.	Kull min titkellem miegħu jkun qed jgħid li għandu dan ħażin ħafna.
For, like, fun.	Għal, bħal, gost.
I think the latter is better.	Naħseb li l-aħħar huwa aħjar.
I'm not going now.	Jien mhux sejjer issa.
I do whatever it takes.	Jien nagħmel dak kollu li hemm bżonn.
It's here.	Huwa hawn.
Someone will come.	Xi ħadd se jiġi.
It was just one.	Kien wieħed biss.
He must be here.	Huwa għandu jkun hawn.
I still often do.	Għadni spiss nagħmel.
Someone was out there.	Xi ħadd kien hemm barra.
He came alone.	Ġie waħdu.
He wasn’t going to be around.	Hu ma kienx se jkun madwar.
I hope everything works for you.	Nispera li kollox jaħdem għalik.
The last one is enough.	L-aħħar waħda hija biżżejjed.
There was nothing.	Ma kien hemm xejn.
Most people here have a car.	Ħafna nies hawn għandhom karozza.
With too little.	Bi ftit wisq.
Who was she? 	Min kienet hi?
Work.	Xogħol.
Or maybe it was just me.	Jew forsi kont jien biss.
He may be with you later this afternoon.	Jista’ jkun miegħek aktar tard illum wara nofsinhar.
We have to do both.	Irridu nagħmlu t-tnejn.
It was his first time.	Kienet l-ewwel darba tiegħu.
We have to do something, and fast!	Irridu nagħmlu xi ħaġa, u malajr!
You want to make sure it’s not easy for him.	Trid tagħmel ċert li mhux faċli għalih.
The car	Il-karozza
So it is with every job.	Hekk hu ma' kull xogħol.
I’m going to go and get some.	Jien se mmur u nieħu ftit.
Obviously no one is going to do that.	Ovvjament ħadd mhu se jagħmel dan.
And so she did.	U hekk għamlet.
This is a very good car.	Din hija karozza tajba ħafna.
I knew he would do it.	Kont naf li se tagħmel dan.
If we ever did.	Jekk qatt għamilna.
He went to stay not too long after.	Huwa mar joqgħod mhux wisq wara.
Maybe not as well.	Forsi mhux hekk kif.
I didn’t want to hear any more.	Ma ridtx nisma aktar.
It looks great.	Jidher kbir.
Do nothing more.	Ma tagħmel xejn aktar.
I don’t want to go.	Ma rridx li tmur.
Maybe you will.	Forsi inti tkun.
And now he knows nothing.	U issa ma jaf xejn.
I hope you are not alone tonight.	Nispera li ma tkunx waħdek illejla.
So many years ago now.	Tant snin ilu issa.
I wasn’t there.	Jien ma kontx hemm.
There was no time to think.	Ma kienx hemm ħin biex taħseb.
You can't go back.	Ma tistax lura.
He was good.	Huwa kien tajjeb.
To be happy.	Biex tkun kuntent.
He died trying.	Miet jipprova.
Not more than a few years.	Mhux aktar minn ftit snin.
I have been doing this for many years.	Ilni nagħmel dan għal ħafna snin.
Not if she knew about it, she wouldn’t.	Mhux kieku kienet taf dwar dan, ma kinitx se.
I couldn’t believe this happened so quickly.	Ma stajtx nemmen li dan ġara daqshekk malajr.
Which is good for me.	Li huwa tajjeb miegħi.
As long as we were together, he was glad.	Sakemm konna flimkien, kien ferħan.
But sometimes.	Imma xi drabi.
Obviously it wasn’t me to say.	Ovvjament ma kienx jien ngħid.
But there is no one who does everything.	Imma m'hemm ħadd li jagħmel kollox.
We did it last night.	Għamilna lbieraħ filgħaxija.
Maybe it was better that it wasn’t.	Forsi kien aħjar li ma kienx.
It's very not enough.	Huwa ħafna mhux biżżejjed.
That's what.	Dak hu dak.
But little did he know about it.	Imma ftit kien jaf dwarha.
I think this is what comes next.	Naħseb li dan huwa dak li ġej.
I didn’t.	Jien ma kontx.
I really hope he does well.	Verament nittama li jagħmel tajjeb.
Let me say so again.	Ħa ngħid hekk mill-ġdid.
And maybe a lot more.	U forsi ħafna aktar.
I love my time here.	Jien inħobb il-ħin tiegħi hawn.
Everything that was going to happen was happening here.	Dak kollu li kien se jiġri kien jiġri hawn.
We know very little about her.	Ma tantx nafu xejn dwarha.
I could see he was home.	Stajt nara li kien id-dar.
She is so beautiful.	Hija sabiħa hekk.
I think this is about.	Naħseb li dan huwa dwar.
And there was nothing.	U ma kien hemm xejn.
I was doing other things.	Kont qed nagħmel affarijiet oħra.
There was no need to be afraid either.	Lanqas ma kien hemm bżonn li nibża’.
I'm worried too.	Jien inkwetat ukoll.
It wasn’t good.	Ma kienx tajjeb.
He told me he was tired.	Huwa qalli li kien għajjien.
She was doing a lot.	Kienet tagħmel ħafna.
And he knew mine.	U kien jaf tiegħi.
He just left.	Huwa biss telaq.
You often have to stay home.	Ħafna drabi trid toqgħod id-dar.
There was no one else there, just us.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor hemm, biss aħna.
Keep talking.	Jibqa’ jitkellem.
If you are unsure, do it.	Jekk m'intix ċert, tagħmel dan.
It’s a good idea if it’s one you like.	Hija idea tajba jekk tkun waħda li tixtieq.
I was here.	Jien kont hawn.
I’m taking that.	Qed nieħu dik.
No one knew where they were.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn kienu.
But enough is enough.	Imma biżżejjed huwa biżżejjed.
I think we did.	Naħseb li għamilna.
We should probably go.	Probabbilment għandna mmorru.
Not good, but great.	Mhux tajjeb, imma kbir.
This is so small.	Dan huwa daqshekk żgħir.
You should be done with your work by now.	Għandek tkun lest ix-xogħol tiegħek sa issa.
Much of this here.	Ħafna minn dan hawn.
But this is my first account.	Imma dan huwa l-ewwel kont tiegħi.
I’ve never done one so big before.	Qatt ma għamilt waħda daqshekk kbira qabel.
I just knew it was going to happen someday.	Kont naf biss li xi darba kien se jiġri.
Which is that.	Li hija dik.
And he knew.	U kien jaf.
You have been a great help.	Int kont ta’ għajnuna kbira.
Whatever it is.	Ikun xi jkun dan.
But no, not really.	Imma le, mhux verament.
It would take some time.	Ikun jieħu xi żmien.
I doubt it would be a good thing.	Niddubita li jkun xi ħaġa tajba.
Once upon a time there was someone else.	Darba kien xi ħadd ieħor.
After everyone had seen everything.	Wara li kulħadd kien ra kollox.
It will be too late.	Huwa se jkun tard.
I think it was never done.	Naħseb li qatt ma sar.
When it’s good, it’s really good.	Meta jkun tajjeb, huwa tassew tajjeb.
They have no.	Huma għandhom l-ebda.
I don’t know where he is.	Ma nafx fejn hu.
He should never have come to this.	Qatt ma kellu jasal għal dan.
It’s what we need.	Hu dak li għandna bżonn.
But not mine.	Imma mhux tiegħi.
Quick and easy to do.	Malajr u faċli biex tagħmel.
Not too big.	Mhux kbir wisq.
He had to be back by now.	Huwa kellu jkun lura sa issa.
She was with me.	Hija kienet miegħi.
Really.	Tassew.
Maybe not until later.	Forsi mhux sa aktar tard.
Who knows not to speak.	Min jaf ma jitkellem.
He wants to come back.	Irid jerġa’ lura.
He didn't even have to look again.	Lanqas ma kellu jerġa’ jara xi ħaġa sabiħa.
Good chance.	Ċans tajjeb.
Look so alone.	Ħares hekk waħedha.
I'm your friend	Jien ħabib tiegħek
I can do this better than he can.	Jien nista' nagħmel dan aħjar milli jista' hu.
But no one as big as him.	Imma ħadd kbir daqs tiegħu.
But staying out here will never do.	Imma li toqgħod barra hawn qatt mhu se tagħmel.
Maybe we had.	Forsi kellna.
No one had anything to say.	Ħadd ma kellu xi jgħid.
I know he knew.	Naf li kien jaf.
That too would be wrong.	Dan ukoll ikun ħażin.
There was no time for that.	Ma kienx hemm ħin għal dan.
Who shouldn’t have been here until later.	Min ma kellux ikun hawn sa aktar tard.
I will be there in no time.	Inkun hemm fi ftit żmien.
That I know enough.	Dan naf biżżejjed.
It goes well.	Imur tajjeb.
His may be coming soon enough.	Tiegħu jista’ jkun li ġej malajr biżżejjed.
I was a little scared.	Kont nibża’ ftit.
There should be more.	Għandu jkun hemm aktar.
It was forever.	Kien għal dejjem.
I was not afraid of anything.	Ma kont nibża’ minn xejn.
I might be you later.	I jista 'jkun li inti aktar tard.
You look tired.	Inti tidher għajjien.
We should not do that.	M'għandniex nagħmlu dan.
Or maybe it was something.	Jew forsi xi ħaġa kienet.
So be it, he thought.	Hekk ikun, ħaseb.
It seems they are.	Jidher li huma.
We can do something about it.	Nistgħu nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwarha.
One of his.	Wieħed minn tiegħu.
I don’t know, I don’t want to know.	Ma nafx, ma rridx inkun naf.
I'm good at this.	Jien tajjeb b'dan.
Not you, of course.	Mhux int, ovvjament.
I had none of that.	Jien ma kelli xejn minn dan.
Not talking but just watching.	Mhux titkellem imma tara biss.
You seem to want more.	Jidher li trid aktar.
She says she won't go.	Tgħid li mhux se tmur.
Come home with me.	Ejja d-dar miegħi.
Same idea, really.	L-istess idea, tassew.
Sometimes it was great.	Xi drabi kienet kbira.
You really can.	Inti verament tista '.
This may or may not be a good thing.	Din tista’ tkun xi ħaġa tajba jew le.
I could see he was scared.	Stajt nara li kien jibża.
But later.	Imma aktar tard.
And think more about it.	U taħseb aktar dwarha.
You can probably think.	Inti tista 'probabbilment taħseb.
It wasn’t too late.	Ma kienx tard wisq.
Its not.	Tiegħu le.
Nothing had happened.	Ma kien ġara xejn.
He doesn't want to know what's going on here.	Ma jridx ikun jaf x’inhu jiġri hawn.
After all it works.	Wara kollox jaħdem.
There is nothing there.	M'hemm xejn hemmhekk.
As I was.	Kif kont.
I can’t tell you much.	Ma nistax ngħidlek ħafna.
It remains so.	Jibqa' hekk.
Let's go tomorrow.	Ejja mmorru għada.
I'll talk to you later.	I ser nitkellem miegħek aktar tard.
And a lot of people.	U ħafna nies.
But it happens that way.	Imma jiġri hekk.
Now he entered the room.	Issa daħal fil-kamra.
He must look really good.	Huwa għandu jidher tassew tajjeb.
I can’t wait any longer.	Ma nistax nistenna aktar.
I wanted better for him.	Jien ridt aħjar għalih.
Surely they were.	Żgur li kienu.
That was probably enough.	Probabbilment dan kien biżżejjed.
It will do more than you want.	Se tagħmel aktar minn dak li tixtieq.
We need this to work.	Għandna bżonn li dan jaħdem.
It would be.	Kieku tkun.
I had to talk to him.	Kelli nitkellem miegħu.
Same as everyone else.	L-istess bħal kulħadd.
He wanted everything to stay the same.	Ried li kollox jibqa l-istess.
I know he’s there.	Naf li qiegħed hemm.
I'm not coming back.	Jien mhux ġej lura.
It could have happened.	Seta’ ġara.
Maybe after he had died.	Forsi wara li kien miet.
I thought it was a good idea at the time.	Ħsibt li kienet idea tajba dak iż-żmien.
He is still a man.	Għadu raġel.
Not quite easy before.	Mhux pjuttost faċli qabel.
And you're here.	U int hawn.
He had not left.	Ma kienx telaq.
It had to be the same.	Kellu jkun l-istess.
I had no idea what was going to happen.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'se jiġri.
He is not happy.	Hu mhux kuntent.
You hardly eat anything.	Ma tantx tiekol xejn.
I don’t do any of that.	Jien ma nagħmel xejn minn hekk.
Maybe that was the problem.	Forsi dik kienet il-problema.
Maybe it still does.	Forsi għadha tagħmel.
Have you ever been there?	Qatt kont hemm?
But he couldn't see anything.	Imma ma seta’ jara xejn.
He saw a lot and went through a lot.	Huwa ra ħafna u għadda minn ħafna.
If he couldn’t have it.	Kieku ma setax ikollu.
I’m not going at all.	Jien mhux sejjer għal kollox.
I did, he said.	Dan għamilt, qal.
I wanted to understand.	Ridt nifhem.
It really is.	Huwa tassew.
Quite a while.	Pjuttost żmien.
But other people.	Imma nies oħra.
Apparently he didn’t.	Jidher li ma kellux.
It was the first time for me.	Kienet l-ewwel darba għalija.
She needed to think and plan.	Hija kellha bżonn taħseb u tippjana.
Many people were there.	Ħafna nies kienu hemm.
And you are right.	U għandek raġun.
A person or thing that.	Persuna jew ħaġa li.
Also, before.	Barra minn hekk, qabel.
There there.	Hemm hemm.
And a lot more out there for sure.	U ħafna aktar hemmhekk żgur.
It’s the same for everyone.	Huwa l-istess għal kulħadd.
So is everyone.	Hekk hu kulħadd.
He was not ready.	Ma kienx lest.
But of course there is a problem.	Imma ovvjament hemm problema.
I can’t understand how this should work.	Ma nistax nifhem kif dan għandu jaħdem.
But we will.	Imma aħna se.
Your problem must be something else.	Il-problema tiegħek trid tkun xi ħaġa oħra.
Definitely there.	Żgur li hemm.
He was not a happy man.	Ma kienx raġel ferħan.
I definitely need to.	Żgur li għandi bżonn.
But this is not so.	Imma dan mhux hekk.
I think it was me.	Naħseb li kont jien.
He agreed with me.	Huwa qabel miegħi.
That's what he has to do.	Dak hu li għandu jagħmel.
You know how.	Taf kif tista’.
And all this for me.	U dan kollu għalija.
And it was still.	U kien għadu.
And she does.	U hi tagħmel.
This can be quite difficult.	Dan jista 'jkun pjuttost diffiċli.
If it wasn’t, it would be.	Jekk ma kienx, ikun.
This and much more.	Dan u ħafna aktar.
He is our only child.	Huwa l-uniku tifel tagħna.
I went tonight.	Mort illejla.
You are so beautiful.	Int tant sabiħa.
That's nothing.	Dak mhux xejn.
I went and did.	Mort u għamilt.
This is better for you.	Dan huwa aħjar għalik.
I know how he thinks.	Naf kif jaħseb.
My money is on 'no'.	Flus tiegħi huma fuq 'le'.
Apparently not.	Jidher li le.
It was early.	Kien kmieni.
But not here, and not now.	Imma mhux hawn, u mhux issa.
Too big, of course.	Kbir wisq, ovvjament.
Come on out.	Ejja barra.
Or bad for you.	Jew ħażin għalik.
There were other things.	Kien hemm affarijiet oħra.
Almost there, now.	Kważi hemm, issa.
He died later that evening.	Huwa miet aktar tard dik il-lejla.
There are probably too many people out there, he said.	Probabbilment hemm wisq nies hemmhekk, qal.
It was the first difficult year on its own.	Kienet l-ewwel sena diffiċli waħdi.
I knew I was coming.	Kont naf li ġejt.
Tell me why.	Tgħidli għaliex.
But we do it.	Imma nagħmlu dan.
That is supposed to have already happened.	Dak suppost diġà ġara.
It seemed like it wasn't going to happen now.	Deher li dan mhux se jiġri issa.
He did everything.	Għamel kollox.
Not much, but little.	Mhux ħafna, imma ftit.
That was a good time.	Dak kien żmien tajjeb.
Which is wrong.	Li huwa ħażin.
I know what he wants and what he needs.	Naf xi jrid u x’għandu bżonn.
Definitely something is wrong.	Żgur li xi ħaġa hi ħażina.
But you thought about it.	Imma int ħsibt dwarha.
He was a man.	Kien raġel.
But it will not stay there.	Imma mhux se jibqa’ hemm.
He would never know now.	Hu qatt ma kien ikun jaf issa.
You won’t know for a while.	Mhux se tkun taf għal xi żmien.
It was not easy.	Ma kienx faċli.
He didn’t have to do that either.	Ma kellux jagħmel dan lanqas.
I wasn’t there.	Ma kontx hemm.
That was pretty good.	Dak kien pjuttost tajjeb.
I have a big problem.	Għandi problema kbira.
But you are mine.	Imma int tiegħi.
Nobody wanted to play.	Ħadd ma ried jilgħab.
Hard to say.	Diffiċli ngħid.
Now, someone had to.	Issa, xi ħadd kellu.
He became a great teacher.	Sar għalliem kbir.
You are back.	Inti lura.
I am nothing now.	Jiena xejn issa.
If you're not happy, say so.	Jekk m'intix kuntent, għid hekk.
Work started early.	Ix-xogħol beda kmieni.
I hope to come back soon.	Nispera li tiġi lura dalwaqt.
She just wants to be happy.	Hija trid biss li tkun kuntent.
Something about time.	Xi ħaġa dwar iż-żmien.
We were doing nothing.	Konna nagħmlu xejn.
You can never tell.	Qatt ma tista’ tgħid.
Tired looks.	Għajjien jistenna.
There must be.	Hemm irid ikun.
Come with me if you like.	Ejja miegħi jekk tixtieq.
He was very happy.	Kien kuntent ħafna.
He knew what was coming.	Kien jaf x’kien ġej.
He is doing nothing.	Mhu qed jagħmel xejn.
Well, sometimes.	Ukoll, xi drabi.
Whatever it is, it will be good.	Ikun xi jkun, ikun tajjeb.
Well, that made things a lot easier.	Ukoll, dan għamel l-affarijiet ħafna aktar faċli.
She had very few friends.	Ma tantx kellha ħbieb.
Which is not a good thing.	Li mhix xi ħaġa tajba.
The first will not.	L-ewwel mhux se.
In addition.	Barra minn hekk.
If, in fact, they were there.	Kieku, fil-fatt, kienu hemm.
Soon, it will be.	Dalwaqt, se jkun.
I didn't know what was going on.	Ma kontx naf x’kien qed jiġri.
It is a problem.	Hija problema.
I saw nothing.	Ma rajt xejn.
By this time tomorrow, you know.	Sa dan iż-żmien għada, tkun taf.
And there is something else.	U hemm ħaġa oħra.
I don’t know why.	Ma nafx għaliex.
And if anything, the job was a little easier.	U jekk xejn, ix-xogħol kien ftit aktar faċli.
Really like this well.	Verament bħal dan tajjeb.
But it really was more like this.	Imma verament kien aktar bħal dan.
It must be one or the other.	Għandu jkun wieħed jew ieħor.
Neither do we.	U lanqas aħna.
No one will ever know about it.	Ħadd qatt mhu se jkun jaf dwar dan.
She is unemployed.	Hija bla xogħol.
Not sure why it's not working now.	Mhux ċert għaliex mhux qed jaħdem issa.
She had no friends.	Ma kellha l-ebda ħbieb.
Something must come first, something last.	Xi ħaġa trid tiġi l-ewwel, xi ħaġa l-aħħar.
I doubt anyone will.	Niddubita li xi ħadd se.
I'm still yours.	Għadni tiegħek.
We just had something.	Kellna biss xi ħaġa.
Everything was ready.	Kollox kien lest.
Like a man.	Bħal raġel.
It was just one.	Kien wieħed biss.
It seems to everyone.	Jidher li kulħadd.
It was just pretty.	Kien biss pjuttost.
That came to you, you know.	Li wasal għalik, taf.
He had done this once before.	Huwa kien għamel dan darba qabel.
I couldn’t stand it.	Jien ma stajtx noqgħod.
She knew what you wanted.	Kienet taf xi trid.
You are not going.	M'intix sejjer.
I can eat anything.	Kapaċi niekol xi ħaġa.
Said one man.	Qal raġel wieħed.
I will sit down.	Jien se noqgħod bilqiegħda.
And he never came back.	U qatt ma ġie lura.
I want that now.	Irrid li issa.
I can't see normally.	Ma nistax nara normalment.
I don’t think otherwise.	Ma naħsibx mod ieħor.
And nothing is still the same problems.	U xejn għadu l-istess problemi.
There was more, too.	Kien hemm aktar, ukoll.
I had a great idea.	Kelli idea kbira.
Okay, tomorrow morning.	Tajjeb, għada filgħodu.
You can do as much or as little as you want.	Tista 'tagħmel kemm jew ftit kif tixtieq.
Like, really hard.	Bħal, verament diffiċli.
It's the same.	Huwa l-istess.
We are so on that.	Aħna hekk fuq dak.
This was not for him.	Dan ma kienx għalih.
It would not be enough at all.	Ma jkunx biżżejjed għal kollox.
He agreed to try.	Huwa qabel li jipprova.
I don’t and won’t.	Jien m'għandix u mhux se.
That was all a long time ago.	Dak kollu kien żmien twil ilu.
Currently.	Bħalissa.
She knows exactly why.	Hija taf eżatt għaliex.
Tell anyone what's really going on.	Tgħid lil ħadd x’inhu verament jiġri.
It was all happening.	Kulħadd kien qed jiġri.
A little.	Ftit.
All this.	Dan kollu.
That was good.	Li kien tajjeb.
This is how you can do it.	Dan huwa kif tista 'tagħmel dan.
I was all set to go.	Jien kont kollu lest biex immur.
That couldn’t be.	Li ma setax ikun.
And small here, you know.	U żgħir hawn, taf.
Very almost.	Ħafna kważi.
It had been.	Kien ġie.
I know there is more to it than that.	Naf li hemm aktar minn hekk.
We never did.	Aħna qatt ma.
And that’s not much.	U dan mhux ħafna.
It seems I can’t do that.	Jidher li ma nistax nagħmel dan.
This was going too far.	Dan kien sejjer wisq.
To be able to do that.	Biex tkun tista 'tagħmel dan.
And it’s not hard to see who he is.	U mhux diffiċli biex tara li hu.
I hear you have something for us.	Jiena nisma' li għandek xi ħaġa għalina.
That’s a bad idea for me.	Dik għalija hija idea ħażina.
I can go outside.	Nista’ mmur barra.
Not once has it happened.	Mhux darba ma ġara.
He probably wasn’t expecting it.	Probabbilment ma kienx jistenna.
It really was.	Kien tassew.
Maybe it’s a good thing.	Forsi hija ħaġa tajba.
I can't see anyone here.	Ma nista' nara lil ħadd hawn.
And now he was gone.	U issa kien telaq.
We had nothing like this.	Ma kellna xejn bħal dan.
I need to know something.	Għandi bżonn li tkun taf xi ħaġa.
But he was not there.	Imma hu ma kienx hemm.
I'm really, really.	Jien tassew tassew.
We will do that for you.	Aħna ser nagħmlu dan għalik.
Come to me, tonight.	Ejja għandi, illejla.
He did a job.	Huwa sar xogħol.
Maybe not forever.	Forsi mhux għal dejjem.
Look! 	Ħares!
But not until then.	Imma mhux sa dak iż-żmien.
It looks like money.	Jidher qisu flus.
I did well.	Jien għamilt tajjeb.
Maybe so it is.	Forsi hekk hu.
As possible.	Kif jista’ jkun.
There really is no other way.	M'hemm verament l-ebda mod ieħor.
Something better, he knew, was out there for him.	Xi ħaġa aħjar, kien jaf, kien hemm barra għalih.
You can tell.	Tista 'tgħid.
Let’s do this together.	Ejja nagħmlu dan flimkien.
I will not say.	Jien mhux se ngħid.
No one is sure.	Ħadd mhu ċert.
If that was your only job, sure, a few hours of work.	Jekk dan kien l-uniku xogħol tiegħek, żgur, ftit sigħat xogħol.
If anyone can do it, she can.	Jekk xi ħadd jista 'jagħmel dan, hi tista'.
Not after the last time he had done so.	Mhux wara l-aħħar darba li kien għamel hekk.
Very, very big.	Ħafna, kbir ħafna.
Or maybe he can, but not tonight.	Jew forsi jista’, imma mhux illejla.
He doesn't want to leave.	Ma jridx jitlaq.
He knew a lot.	Kien jaf ħafna.
What he had seen was like nothing.	Dak li kellu jidher kien bħal xejn.
But you can't take that.	Imma inti ma tistax tieħu dan.
I had to go back.	Kelli mmur lura.
Where you want to be.	Fejn trid tkun.
This was not good.	Dan ma kienx tajjeb.
And now here he is again.	U issa hawn hu mill-ġdid.
We were doing the same.	Konna qed nagħmlu l-istess.
I never did that.	Qatt ma għamilt hekk.
It was a good thing, supposedly.	Kienet xi ħaġa tajba, suppost.
And of course, it doesn't.	U ovvjament, ma.
I have nowhere to go.	M'għandi fejn immur.
I can speak.	Kapaċi nitkellem.
It was just what he needed.	Kien biss dak li kellu bżonn.
You are the only one who can say.	Inti l-uniku wieħed li jista 'jgħid.
That always works for me.	Li dejjem jaħdem għalija.
He did a pretty good job.	Huwa għamel xogħol pjuttost tajjeb.
If you have ever seen anyone again.	Jekk qatt ra lil xi ħadd mill-ġdid.
I hope he comes back.	Nispera li jiġi lura.
Well, maybe they do.	Ukoll, forsi jagħmlu.
He always does.	Huwa dejjem jagħmel.
No one knew.	Ħadd ma kien jaf.
I really like everything.	Jien inħobb ħafna kollox.
Just as we are.	Biss kif aħna.
And now, now she knew more.	U issa, issa kienet taf aktar.
He's probably right.	Huwa probabbilment raġun.
You can be the same.	Inti tista 'tkun l-istess.
I know a lot of people.	Naf ħafna nies.
I did of course.	Għamilt ovvjament.
We have what we need.	Għandna dak li għandna bżonn.
It's just not too late.	Huwa biss mhux tard wisq.
It still works.	Għadu jaħdem.
I like to hear what everyone has to say !.	Inħobb nisma' dak li kulħadd għandu xi jgħid!.
You don't have to either.	Lanqas m'għandekx.
My friend is here now.	Ħabib tiegħi qiegħed hawn issa.
It's still there.	Għadu hemm.
And if they were.	U kieku kienu.
That time you have.	Dak il-ħin li għandek.
But there were too many.	Imma kien hemm wisq.
We don't have a child.	M'għandniex tifel.
I don’t want to do anything about it.	Ma rrid nagħmel xejn dwarha.
That's harder.	Dik hija aktar diffiċli.
You are the first.	Inti l-ewwel.
You think.	Inti taħseb.
It's there.	Qiegħed hemm.
She knew.	Kienet taf.
Nothing ever happens.	Qatt ma jiġri xejn.
More than you think.	Aktar milli taħseb.
On and on it goes.	Fuq u fuq imur.
But please.	Imma jekk jogħġbok.
It wasn’t something he did much of.	Ma kinitx xi ħaġa li għamel ħafna.
But that's not the case either.	Imma dan mhux hekk lanqas.
I know you from everything.	Jiena naf li inti minn kollox.
There are many such.	Hemm ħafna bħal dawn.
This is what we do.	Dan huwa dak li nagħmlu.
And nothing can.	U xejn ma jista’.
There were too many people.	Kien hemm wisq nies.
A great one.	Waħda kbira.
What are you doing? 	X'qed tagħmel?
This is what happened to other people.	Dan huwa dak li ġara lil nies oħra.
In fact, it is very easy.	Fil-fatt, huwa faċli ħafna.
Really, it is.	Tassew, huwa.
He will want it for nothing.	Hu se jkun irid għal xejn.
Everyone just looked.	Kulħadd biss ħares.
But there is.	Imma hemm.
Where she needed to stay.	Fejn kellha bżonn toqgħod.
This happens to a few people at a time.	Dan jiġri lil ftit nies kull darba.
I was worried for you.	Kont inkwetat għalik.
I don't listen to everyone.	Jien ma nisma’ lil kulħadd.
Nobody said.	Ma qal ħadd.
Soon, very soon.	Dalwaqt, malajr ħafna.
And more than once.	U aktar minn darba.
I say so I said.	Jien ngħid hekk għidt.
She had to think more about it.	Kellha taħseb aktar dwarha.
I had thought, of course, many times.	Jien kont ħsibt, ovvjament, ħafna drabi.
No one ever does.	Ħadd qatt ma jagħmel.
That was fast.	Dak kien malajr.
I don’t like it.	Jien ma nħobbx.
She knew everything.	Kienet taf kollox.
But you don’t need my help.	Imma m'għandekx bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħi.
I didn’t want to think about it anymore.	Ma ridtx naħseb aktar.
She looked like she was going to talk.	Kienet tidher li kienet se titkellem.
This is you and be sure.	Dan qed tkun int u tkun ċert.
He had arrived.	Huwa kien wasal.
He had to wait.	Kellu jistenna.
He was here first went to school.	Kien hawn l-ewwel mar l-iskola.
He looked the same.	Huwa ħares l-istess.
Today, no one is trying.	Illum, ħadd mhu qed jipprova.
Lots of fun.	Ħafna gost.
That's one.	Dik wieħed hu.
I'm pretty tired.	Jien pjuttost għajjien.
And he’s not the only one.	U hu mhux l-uniku wieħed.
But he saw nothing.	Imma ma ra xejn.
Worth a try.	Ta’ min jipprova.
We are so good.	Aħna tant tajjeb.
It's yours now.	Hija tiegħek issa.
Nothing good happens.	Ma jiġri xejn tajjeb.
He was not relying on anything.	Ma kien joqgħod fuq xejn.
You can eat do anything.	Tista' tiekol tagħmel xi ħaġa.
Very well, you can come if you want.	Tajjeb ħafna, tista’ tiġi jekk trid.
There would never have been another after today.	Qatt ma kien ikun hemm ieħor wara llum.
It was very good.	Kien tajjeb ħafna.
And it actually does it right.	U fil-fatt tagħmel dan tajjeb.
I am very happy with this.	Jiena ferħan ħafna b'dan.
I didn’t have long to think about it.	Ma kellix twil biex naħseb dwarha.
Besides, he did nothing.	Barra minn hekk, ma għamel xejn.
No, I won't say that.	Le mhux se ngħid hekk.
Or anyone can.	Jew xi ħadd jista '.
Maybe it wasn't.	Forsi ma kienx.
And so it happened.	U hekk ġara.
He was trying to say something to his friend.	Kien qed jipprova jgħid xi ħaġa lil ħabib tiegħu.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
Now he could only wait.	Issa seta’ jistenna biss.
I will never do anything else.	Qatt ma nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
Where he wasn't sure.	Fejn ma kienx ċert.
Well, maybe so.	Ukoll, forsi hekk.
That’s what I was told to do.	Hu dak li qalli nagħmel dan.
We do the same thing.	Aħna nagħmlu l-istess ħaġa.
I was surprised and happy.	Kont sorpriż u kuntent.
I think it would be better if no one.	Naħseb li jkun aħjar jekk ħadd.
I have that.	Jien għandi dak.
Not just us.	Mhux aħna biss.
, '.	, '.
This would be as bad as some other people have.	Dan ikun ħażin daqs kemm għandhom xi nies oħra.
It's just.	Huwa biss.
You are not doing everything you can.	M’intix qed tagħmel dak kollu li tista’ tagħmel.
It is and should be.	Huwa u għandu jkun.
One by one.	Wieħed wieħed.
There is nothing more for me.	M'hemm xejn aktar għalija.
He had no idea it was so bad.	Ma kellux idea li kien daqshekk ħażin.
Both were more.	It-tnejn kienu aktar.
Neither are you.	Lanqas int jien.
You have to think about it.	Trid taħseb dwar dan.
It should be just.	Għandu jkun biss.
He has been working on the book for some time.	Ilu jaħdem fuq il-ktieb għal xi żmien.
Everything because you can.	Kollox għaliex inti tista '.
I wasn’t home.	Jien ma kontx id-dar.
I saw.	Rajt.
This cannot stand.	Dan ma jistax joqgħod.
Same thing, really.	L-istess ħaġa, tassew.
Hours, he thought.	Sigħat, ħaseb.
It’s usually great.	Normalment hi kbira.
It's hard to see.	Huwa diffiċli biex tara.
I don’t want to be here.	Ma rridx hawn.
Not our problem.	Mhux il-problema tagħna.
They are friends now.	Huma ħbieb issa.
You have to think.	Trid taħseb.
It didn’t help, he thought.	Ma kienx jgħin, ħaseb.
Not enough to say.	Mhux biżżejjed li tgħid.
Maybe better than, you know, someone did before.	Forsi aħjar milli, taf, xi ħadd għamel qabel.
But there is too much to do now.	Imma hemm wisq biex jagħmel issa.
I need someone like that.	Għandi bżonn xi ħadd bħal dak.
I had a lot to say.	Kelli ħafna xi ngħid.
You can't tell what you're thinking.	Ma tistax tgħid x'qed taħseb.
Or maybe it wasn’t.	Jew forsi ma kienx.
She wants to help.	Hi trid tkun ta’ għajnuna.
But this is not so now.	Imma dan mhux hekk issa.
Nobody knew exactly what was going to happen.	Ħadd ma kien jaf eżatt x’kien se jiġri.
Maybe he can.	Forsi jista’.
Not for long now.	Mhux għal żmien twil issa.
Make it difficult.	Tagħmel dan diffiċli.
And we almost don’t have time.	U kważi m'għandniex ħin.
I really was.	Jien tassew kont.
As it should be.	Kif għandu jkun.
I know he is.	Naf li hu.
But there it was.	Imma hemm kien.
I was just thinking about you yesterday.	Kont biss naħseb għalik ilbieraħ.
She may be going to know.	Hija tista 'tkun se tkun taf.
I really believe that now.	Verament nemmen li issa.
I really don’t want to understand that.	Ma tantx irrid nifhem dan.
Or so everyone thought.	Jew hekk ħaseb kulħadd.
I hope you do the same.	Nispera li tagħmel l-istess.
I’m pretty sure he’s not doing that.	Jien pjuttost ċert li mhux qed jagħmel hekk.
I’ve been there before.	Jien kont hemm qabel.
I’m not really here.	Jien ma tantx hawn.
This happens often.	Dan jiġri ta 'spiss.
He seemed to know something.	Deher li kien jaf xi ħaġa.
It's a lot.	Huwa ħafna.
You and I, here, can do it.	Int u jien, hawn, nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
I don’t want to have to be.	Ma rridx ikolli nkun.
You are so good to us.	Inti tant tajjeb magħna.
Nothing we can do.	Xejn nistgħu nagħmlu.
And you're good.	U int tajjeb.
That was something.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa.
Here and here.	Hawn u hawn.
That’s good of course.	Dak huwa tajjeb ovvjament.
There can be nothing.	Jista' jkun hemm xejn.
It will be great for us for a long, long time.	Hija se tkun kbira għalina għal żmien twil u twil.
But never something like that.	Imma qatt xi ħaġa bħal din.
Above and more.	Fuq u aktar.
It works well for almost everything.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb għal kważi kollox.
I thought that was what he was going to do.	Ħsibt li dak kien se jagħmel.
He will be tonight.	Hu ser ikun illejla.
It doesn’t seem like a big problem.	Ma jidhirx li hija problema kbira.
Nor was he a man.	Lanqas ma kien raġel.
He was right, of course.	Huwa kien raġun, ovvjament.
There was nothing else that needed to be there.	Ma kien hemm xejn ieħor li kien jeħtieġ li jkun hemm.
He is a hard working teacher.	Huwa għalliem li jaħdem ħafna.
This can never be good.	Dan qatt ma jista’ jkun tajjeb.
I hope it helps someone.	Nittama li jgħin lil xi ħadd.
Well, maybe not at all.	Ukoll, forsi mhux għal kollox.
I know how to do it.	Naf kif jagħmlu dan.
And she needed my help.	U li kellha bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħi.
I'm yours as much as you are mine.	Jien tiegħek daqskemm int tiegħi.
Not just us either.	Mhux aħna biss lanqas.
She was there.	Kienet hemm.
I have.	Jien għandi.
That’s all he needs.	Dak hu kollu li għandu bżonn.
I need to get back.	Għandi bżonn nerġa' lura.
I knew better than that.	Kont naf aħjar minn hekk.
He knew that now.	Huwa kien jaf li issa.
But there seems to be something wrong.	Imma jidher li hemm xi ħaġa ħażina.
They were doing everything together.	Kienu jagħmlu kollox flimkien.
It won’t be the last time.	Mhux se tkun l-aħħar darba.
But she was the same.	Imma hi kienet l-istess.
But it’s on to something.	Imma qiegħed fuq xi ħaġa.
Come to me.	Jiġi għandi.
He was out of that house.	Huwa kien barra minn dik id-dar.
He just stood there thinking.	Huwa biss kien hemm jaħseb.
She had never done so before.	Hija qatt ma kienet għamlet hekk qabel.
You did it.	Inti għamilt dan.
I still think we have that.	Għadni naħseb li għandna dak.
I know everyone is busy.	Naf li kulħadd huwa okkupat.
More than other people.	Aktar minn nies oħra.
But too much is definitely not a good thing.	Imma wisq żgur mhix xi ħaġa tajba.
But of course, it doesn't.	Imma ovvjament, ma.
It was going well until the end.	Kien sejjer tajjeb sa l-aħħar.
We have to do something about it.	Għandna nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwar dan.
If he does, he can win.	Jekk jagħmel hekk, jista’ jirbaħ.
Many and one.	Ħafna u wieħed.
I'm sure it will.	Jien ċert li se.
No one does, really.	Ħadd ma jagħmel, tassew.
It's pretty good.	Huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
Its so easy and a very good man.	Tiegħu tant faċli u raġel tajjeb ħafna.
And you can never know the truth.	U qatt ma tista’ tkun taf il-verità.
Well, here you go.	Ukoll, hawn inti tmur.
Few do so.	Ftit jagħmlu hekk.
We really can’t do more than that.	Verament ma nistgħux nagħmlu aktar minn hekk.
Nothing is wrong.	Xejn mhu ħażin.
A little is enough.	Ftit huwa biżżejjed.
He is a bad boy.	Huwa tifel ħażin.
To do this.	Biex tagħmel dan.
It happens	Jiġri
It would work well.	Ikun jaħdem tajjeb.
It was a good thing he didn’t need to know.	Kienet xi ħaġa tajba li ma kellux għalfejn isir jaf.
He wasn’t even sure if he could say anything.	Lanqas kien ċert jekk setax jgħid xi ħaġa.
Just about too long.	Biss dwar twil wisq.
Which she is supposed to have done.	Li hi suppost li għamel.
It was too long.	Kien twil wisq.
You said you could.	Inti għidt li tista '.
I'm still young.	Għadni żgħir.
It could be that way.	Jista’ jkun hekk.
So far everything has been working fine.	Sa issa kollox kien jaħdem tajjeb.
It will be this.	Se jkun dan.
I can do something for you.	Nista' nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik.
It really doesn’t.	Tassew ma tagħmilx.
Doing better is not easy.	Li tagħmel aħjar ma tkunx faċli.
Well, he could have stayed there.	Ukoll, kieku kien seta' jibqa' hemm.
It doesn't look good.	Ma jidhirx tajjeb.
I was the same.	Jien kont l-istess.
Now that they were together, he didn't know what to do.	Issa li kienu flimkien ma kienx jaf x’se jagħmel.
And he is my friend.	U hu ħabib tiegħi.
From this.	Minn dan.
Maybe too much.	Forsi wisq.
Really, they are.	Tassew, huma.
Definitely not anyone we knew.	Żgur mhux lil ħadd li konna nafu.
Not too late, you know.	Mhux tard wisq, taf.
He had no idea where this had come from.	Ma kellux idea minn fejn kien ġie dan.
I have seen it happen many times.	Rajt jiġri ħafna drabi.
It's pretty easy.	Huwa pjuttost faċli.
I saw too much not too much.	Rajt wisq mhux wisq.
You may already know this and you may not.	Inti tista 'diġà taf dan u inti tista' le.
And there goes a lot.	U hemmhekk sejjer ħafna.
It was done some time ago.	Sar xi żmien ilu.
I don’t want to be late.	Ma rridx inkun tard.
It's mine, you know.	Huwa tiegħi, taf.
You were just being.	Inti kont qed tkun biss.
You can make friends.	Tista' tagħmel ħbieb.
It's hard to see.	Huwa diffiċli li tara.
This has happened to me only now.	Dan ġara lili biss issa.
Were you out today?	Kont barra llum?
But whatever happens, you have to talk.	Imma dak li jiġri, trid titkellem.
What is bad is bad and not good.	Dak li hu ħażin huwa ħażin u mhux tajjeb.
You should know me better.	Għandek tkun taf lili aħjar.
Well, some things are the same.	Ukoll, xi affarijiet huma l-istess.
You can be seated right here.	Inti tista 'tkun bilqiegħda eżatt hawn.
I don’t even know mine.	Jien lanqas biss naf tiegħi.
It may not be you.	Jista 'ma jkunx int.
That's it, that's it.	Dak hu, hekk hu.
Come on, you know how to do it.	Ejja, taf kif tagħmel dan.
Is there anything else? 	Hemm xi ħaġa oħra?
I just still.	Għadni biss.
This could happen again.	Dan jista' jerġa' jiġri.
I see a few problems with this.	Nara ftit problemi ma 'dan.
There is no way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod.
I know someone died.	Naf li xi ħadd miet.
For me, that was never a problem.	Għalija, dik qatt ma kienet problema.
There is nothing to be had.	M'hemm xejn li jkun hemm.
You have to be there.	Għandek tkun hemmhekk.
The house is quite large.	Id-dar hija pjuttost kbira.
He is not happy about it.	Huwa mhux kuntent dwar dan.
I'll be back tomorrow.	Jien ser inkun lura għada.
He's just a friend.	Huwa biss ħabib.
I was now.	Kont issa.
I’m so glad you came to stay with me.	Jien ferħan ħafna li ġejt toqgħod miegħi.
This is not good enough.	Dan mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
We have enough.	Għandna biżżejjed.
We do that.	Aħna nagħmlu hekk.
What was on.	Dak li kienet fuq.
No, you don’t have to do everything on your own.	Le, m'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel kollox waħdek.
I don’t know what will happen.	Ma nafx x'se jiġri.
I want to talk to him alone.	Irrid nitkellem miegħu waħdi.
And of course she had help.	U ovvjament kellha għajnuna.
In fact, a lot.	Fil-fatt, ħafna.
I really did.	Jien tassew għamilt.
He asked for more.	Huwa talab għal aktar.
Better here than outside.	Aħjar hawn milli barra.
Not good for that.	Mhux tajjeb għal dan.
It was really about something.	Kien verament dwar xi ħaġa.
Or maybe it wasn’t.	Jew forsi ma kienx.
Can you tell me.	Tista’ tgħidli.
It is so.	Huwa hekk.
We know everything.	Nafu kollox.
But he doesn't have to worry.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun inkwetat.
We are.	Aħna.
It doesn't have to be.	M'għandux ikun.
This would not be good.	Dan ma jkunx tajjeb.
There was no time for anything.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda ħin għal xejn.
I had to do something.	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa.
I have nothing to say.	M'għandi ngħid xejn.
But that passed, quickly.	Imma dak għadda, malajr.
It was her.	Kienet hi.
But maybe that’s just me.	Imma forsi dak jien biss.
He went around.	Huwa mar madwar.
He had no problems.	Ma kellux problemi.
Tom will do that by tomorrow.	Tom se jagħmel dan sa għada.
Now you can do it.	Issa inti tista 'tagħmel dan.
Not long ago.	Ftit ilu.
It was good and beautiful.	Kienet tajba u sabiħa.
She was going home.	Kienet tmur id-dar.
No one sees.	Ħadd mhu jara.
It was not the same as before.	Ma kienx l-istess bħal qabel.
Just go, you.	Tmur biss, int.
And she was good with him.	U kienet tajba miegħu.
he asked.	staqsa.
Same size, approx.	L-istess daqs, madwar.
Well, you know about that.	Ukoll, inti taf dwar dan.
I have to say something.	Ikolli rrid ngħid xi ħaġa.
This is my doing.	Dan hu nagħmel tiegħi.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
Until very late in the evening.	Sa tard ħafna filgħaxija.
But he is a very good teacher.	Imma hu għalliem tajjeb ħafna.
No one was really talking about it.	Ħadd ma kien verament jitkellem dwarha.
I said it wasn’t something he had done wrong.	Għidt li ma kienx xi ħaġa li kien għamel ħażin.
It takes a lot of work to do that.	Jeħtieġ ħafna xogħol biex tagħmel dan.
Sure ?.	Żgur?.
Afterwards, they felt better.	Wara, ħassu aħjar.
But it must.	Imma għandu.
I love where we are.	Inħobb fejn aħna.
No one will.	Ħadd ma se.
It happened quickly.	Ġara malajr.
I really want to do that.	Irrid verament nagħmel dan.
Why are you doing this?	Għaliex qed tagħmel dan?
It's always late.	Hija dejjem tard.
There’s a man there, or he was there.	Hemm raġel hemm, jew kien hemm.
But not.	Imma mhux.
It’s too early.	Għadu kmieni wisq.
I'm pretty happy.	Jien pjuttost kuntent.
She is really beautiful.	Hija tassew sabiħa.
They were there at the time.	Dak iż-żmien kienu hemm.
This will not happen.	Dan mhux se jiġri.
And so it was.	U hekk sar.
They were supposed to be here.	Dawn suppost kienu hawn.
I can’t wait to see what it is.	Ma nistax nistenna biex nara x'inhu.
You have one chance.	Għandek ċans wieħed.
After all it went well.	Wara kollox mar tajjeb.
And more back.	U aktar lura.
He was ready for it.	Kien lest għal dan.
He had never loved another.	Hu qatt ma kien iħobb ieħor.
But he never seemed to have had enough.	Imma qatt ma deher li kellu biżżejjed.
It's too easy.	Huwa faċli wisq.
It's been a while since I've been on.	Ilni żmien minn meta kont fuq.
It all happened a long time ago.	Dan kollu ġara żmien ilu.
Whatever.	Tkun xi tkun.
He was surprised he was scared.	Huwa kien sorpriż li kien jibża.
I haven't seen it since.	Sa minn dak iż-żmien għadni ma deherx hekk.
They were together last night.	Kienu flimkien ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
They are, really.	Huma, tassew.
I should know these things.	Għandi naf dawn l-affarijiet.
It doesn't have to be.	M'għandux ikun.
Easy to say.	Faċli li tgħid.
It was with him.	Kien miegħu.
So much.	Daqshekk .
I didn't even know what to say.	Lanqas kont naf x’se ngħid.
But not bad.	Imma mhux ħażin.
I didn’t have time for that.	Ma kellix ħin għal dan.
He knows how to have fun.	Jaf jieħu gost.
He did.	Huwa għamel.
You've come home.	Int stajt ġejt id-dar.
I'll tell you something else.	Jien ngħidlek xi ħaġa oħra.
It's actually very easy.	Huwa fil-fatt faċli ħafna.
This is a bad idea.	Din hija idea ħażina.
I was a little surprised.	Kont xi ftit sorpriż.
Now, of course, maybe it could be a lot better.	Issa, ovvjament, forsi jista 'jkun ħafna aħjar.
We can go back further.	Nistgħu mmorru lura aktar minn hekk.
And he said he wasn’t the only one.	U qal li ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
It was too much for me.	Kien wisq għalija.
It was late and they were tired.	Kien tard u kienu għajjien.
I know we can.	Naf li nistgħu.
You.	Inti.
But she did.	Imma hi għamlet.
But one thing.	Imma ħaġa waħda.
But there was more.	Imma kien hemm aktar.
There was something.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa.
It’s not really about that.	Mhuwiex verament dwar dan.
Maybe he looked there.	Forsi ħares hemm.
They were lovers.	Kienu min iħobb.
I know she did.	Naf li għamlet.
he said.	hu qal.
He would have to think about it.	Kien ikollu jaħseb dwarha.
Sometimes he wasn’t sure if he could survive.	Xi drabi ma kienx ċert jekk setax jgħix.
She thinks wrong.	Hija taħseb ħażin.
I'm just saying.	Qed ngħid biss.
You have, boy.	Għandek, tifel.
Once I did.	Darba għamilt.
But I can't.	Imma ma nistax.
Or maybe he couldn’t.	Jew forsi ma setax.
It could be just one or the other.	Jista' jkun biss wieħed jew ieħor.
That was what he was trying to do.	Dak kien qed jipprova jagħmel.
Above all, we need other people.	Fuq kollox, għandna bżonn nies oħra.
No size fits everyone.	L-ebda daqs ma joqgħod għal kulħadd.
Which is definitely not the case.	Li żgur mhux.
He couldn’t tell how much time had passed.	Ma setax jgħid kemm għadda żmien.
But no.	Imma le.
For a time.	Għal żmien.
I was very happy to do that.	Kont kuntent ħafna li nagħmel dan.
I have one here.	Għandi waħda hawn.
Unless anyone is volunteering to come up with a pretty template?	Sakemm ma jidhirx xi ħadd aktar tard.
There is nothing better.	M'hemm xejn aħjar.
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
I do.	Jien.
It will only take a while before it comes together.	Huwa biss se jieħu ftit żmien qabel ma tiġi flimkien.
It doesn’t seem to have been.	Ma jidhirx li kien.
And here it was.	U hawn kienet.
As long as you want either.	Sakemm trid jew.
It had been too long.	Kien għadda wisq żmien.
I want more time.	Irrid aktar ħin.
I tell you.	Jien ngħidlek.
So was he.	Hekk kien hu.
I wonder why.	Nistaqsi għaliex.
They were there.	Dawn kienu hemm.
But that’s what’s needed.	Imma dak hu li hemm bżonn.
I thought it was just me.	Ħsibt li kont jien biss.
I can never be.	Qatt ma nista’ nkun.
I thought about it a lot.	Ħsibt ħafna dan.
Me too, actually.	Jien ukoll, fil-fatt.
Which it certainly was.	Li żgur kien.
That should be more than enough.	Dan għandu jkun aktar minn biżżejjed.
I wish you had.	Nixtieq li kellek.
Maybe it won’t, either.	Forsi mhux se, lanqas.
And here it came, here it came, here.	U hawn ġie, hawn ġie, hawn.
That's pretty.	Dak huwa pjuttost.
I always said so.	Dejjem għedt hekk.
I am so glad to be here.	Jien ferħan ħafna li nkun hawn.
That comes later.	Dak jiġi aktar tard.
You were doing the same.	Int kont tagħmel l-istess.
I was a lonely man.	Jien kont raġel waħdu.
It makes you better.	Jagħmel inti aħjar.
That’s a lot of work.	Dak huwa ħafna xogħol.
It was mine now.	Kien tiegħi issa.
It works, it all works.	Jaħdem, jaħdem kollu.
There is nothing wrong there.	M'hemm xejn ħażin hemmhekk.
I can't even.	Jien lanqas biss nista.
That it is not.	Li ma jkunx.
Keep coming.	Jibqa' ġej.
I had to be with you.	I kellha tkun miegħek.
He couldn’t and shouldn’t.	Ma setax u m'għandux.
I couldn’t understand it that way.	Ma stajtx nifhem hekk.
It’s the same time for that.	Huwa l-istess żmien għal dan.
Now, it’s here.	Issa, huwa hawn.
He thought he had a chance.	Huwa ħaseb li kellu ċans.
And he leaves.	U jitlaq.
One was today.	Waħda kienet illum.
He was not happy.	Ma kienx kuntent.
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
He was not happy there.	Ma kienx kuntent hemmhekk.
I want so bad to be good.	Irrid daqshekk ħażin biex ikun tajjeb.
Work, work.	Xogħol, xogħol.
Before they were like.	Qabel kienu bħal .
It's going to come around.	Huwa ser jiġi madwar.
He couldn't do anything about it.	Ma seta’ jagħmel xejn dwarha.
I thought there would be.	Ħsibt li jkun hemm.
You were me.	Int kont jien.
More than ever there was.	Aktar milli qatt kien hemm.
Maybe, just maybe, this can work.	Forsi, biss forsi, dan jista 'jaħdem.
I really wonder this.	Verament nistaqsi dan.
As it happens, it came from someone else.	Kif jiġri, ġie minn xi ħadd ieħor.
It was a good thing.	Kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
I eat that every morning.	Jien niekol dak kull filgħodu.
The morning felt better.	Filgħodu ħassu aħjar.
Maybe he's your friend.	Forsi huwa ħabib tiegħek.
Maybe he knows something about it.	Forsi jaf xi ħaġa dwarha.
I'm there too.	Jien hemm ukoll.
It was also.	Kien ukoll.
He was not happy about it.	Ma kienx kuntent dwar dan.
Glad to me.	Ferħan miegħi.
It was really beautiful.	Kienet tassew sabiħa ħafna.
For a while he said no more.	Għal xi żmien qal mhux aktar.
I'm glad you have money.	Jien kuntent li għandek flus.
It's so much easier.	Huwa tant aktar faċli.
Maybe too much.	Forsi wisq.
And he knew it.	U dan kien jaf.
I think we did pretty well with that.	Naħseb li għamilna pjuttost tajjeb b'dan.
I can understand.	Kapaċi nifhem.
Something was wrong wrong, he knew that without knowing why.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina ħażin, kien jaf li mingħajr ma kien jaf għaliex.
I see you have that.	Nara li għandek dik.
It was too much for him.	Kien wisq għalih.
Was that so? 	Kien hekk?
Try to be better.	Ipprova tkun aħjar.
He can do it.	Jista 'jagħmel dan.
Where you have everything, but, nothing.	Fejn għandek kollox, imma, xejn.
I have to really think about it.	Ikolli verament naħseb.
I didn’t want to but.	Jien ma ridtx imma.
It was a bad thing to do.	Kienet xi ħaġa ħażina li tagħmel.
Just like that time so long ago.	Eżatt bħal dak iż-żmien tant ilu.
I can't see this.	Ma nistax nara dan.
He will have to see.	Se jkollu jara.
That's what everyone did.	Hekk għamel kulħadd.
But he could speak.	Imma seta’ jitkellem.
I don’t like him or anything.	Jien mhux inħobb miegħu jew xejn.
I wasn’t even home.	Jien lanqas biss kont id-dar.
This cannot be happening.	Dan ma jistax ikun qed jiġri.
It's already morning.	Huwa diġà filgħodu.
Not you either.	Mhux int ukoll.
I was listening to something.	Jien kont nisma xi ħaġa.
Or maybe so.	Jew forsi hekk.
Which it probably does.	Li probabbilment jagħmel.
It's much easier if you know how.	Huwa ħafna aktar faċli jekk taf kif.
I'm having fun.	Qed nieħu gost.
This is, in fact, what you want.	Dan huwa, fil-fatt, dak li trid.
But there it is.	Imma hemm barra.
I think.	Naħseb.
He became such a good friend.	Sar ħabib daqshekk tajjeb.
He is doing well.	Qed jagħmel tajjeb.
I was right the first time.	Kelli raġun l-ewwel darba.
I don’t like to see things like that.	Ma nħobbx nara affarijiet bħal dawn.
I just got back home when I came.	Għadni kif ġejt lura d-dar meta ġejt.
Most people have only one.	Ħafna nies għandhom wieħed biss.
It can, of course.	Jista ', ovvjament.
I heard about it.	Smajt dwarha.
He should be back tomorrow.	Għandu jkun lura għada.
It didn't look right.	Ma deherx tajjeb.
Only, this is what he needed.	Biss, dan huwa dak li kellu bżonn.
That's not how.	Dak mhux kif.
He was very tired.	Kien għajjien ħafna.
It seemed so long ago.	Deher daqshekk twil ilu.
He will wait as long as needed.	Huwa se jistenna sakemm ikun hemm bżonn.
There will be more than that.	Se jkun hemm aktar minn dan.
He thought and thought.	Ħaseb u ħaseb.
We knew very little about each other.	Ftit li xejn konna nafu dwar xulxin.
It's yours.	Huwa tiegħek.
And this is where we are.	U dan huwa fejn aħna.
So it goes.	Hekk imur.
That’s still pretty good.	Dak li hu għadu pjuttost tajjeb.
Definitely did.	Żgur li għamilt.
This has been the problem for some time.	Din kienet il-problema għal xi żmien.
It is something you have.	Hija xi ħaġa li għandek.
But that’s not good either.	Imma dan mhux tajjeb lanqas.
I can't do anything good here.	Ma nista' nagħmel xejn tajjeb hawn.
I didn’t want you.	Ma ridtx inti.
But it will come.	Imma se jasal.
There you are.	Hemm int.
That was all it was for him.	Dak kien kollu li kienet għalih.
Plus, it’s pretty good for you.	Barra minn hekk, huwa pjuttost tajjeb għalik.
I just want to go.	Irrid biss li tmur.
He started working.	Huwa beda jaħdem.
There was no one here.	Ma kien hemm ħadd hawn.
It seems to work.	Jidher li jaħdem.
He won't be happy, but he will.	Mhux se jkun kuntent, imma se jagħmel.
Someone who didn’t want to be here.	Xi ħadd li ma riedx hawn.
I'm not sure how it happened.	M'inix ċert kif ġara.
I know.	Kont naf.
That should have been enough.	Dan kellu jkun biżżejjed.
This is seen in.	Dan jidher fi.
You don't want to.	Inti ma tridx.
I didn’t know how to do it.	Ma kontx naf kif nagħmel.
Now everything works well for him.	Issa kollox jaħdem tajjeb għalih.
None of this will be easy.	Xejn minn dan mhu se jkun faċli.
How was that.	Kif kien dan.
But a little more.	Imma ftit aktar.
Just not really my thing.	Biss mhux verament ħaġa tiegħi.
Well, it's not.	Ukoll, mhuwiex.
Better to do so.	Aħjar tagħmel hekk.
Everything has to go.	Kollox irid imur.
This was going to be.	Dan kien se jkun.
I really have to do it again.	Tassew għandi nerġa' nagħmel.
If you can only do that.	Jekk inti tista 'biss tagħmel dan.
He’s someone you want to be around.	Huwa xi ħadd li trid tkun madwar.
Not when you think about it.	Mhux meta taħseb dwarha.
I have already done a lot of work today.	Diġà għamilt ħafna xogħol illum.
Maybe it shouldn’t.	Forsi m'għandux.
I'm going up.	Jien sejjer sa.
But it had happened.	Imma kien ġara.
Now it’s as bad as it ever was.	Issa huwa ħażin kif qatt kien.
Nothing was certain, of course.	Xejn ma kien ċert, ovvjament.
I say so again.	Jien ngħid hekk mill-ġdid.
There can be no other.	Ma jistax ikun hemm ieħor.
Just not sure what it is.	Biss mhux ċert x'inhu.
He was doing something.	Kien jagħmel xi ħaġa.
I was talking about what she did.	Kont qed nitkellem dwar dak li għamlet.
I'm great.	Jien kbir.
We do our best.	Nagħmlu nagħmlu kif nistgħu.
It's time!	Wasal iż-żmien!
Definitely don’t.	Żgur li m'għandekx.
It can't be, it can't be, it can't be.	Ma jkunx, ma jistax ikun, ma jistax ikun.
I know the truth!	Inkun naf il-verità!
But he was not interested.	Imma ma kienx interessat.
Or who she was.	Jew min kienet.
This was not who it was supposed to be.	Dan ma kienx min suppost kellu jkun.
You have to eat.	Għandek tiekol.
I know there is more.	Naf li hemm aktar.
He made me.	Huwa għamel lili.
I need this.	Għandi bżonn dan.
We did.	Għamilna.
None of this is happening.	Xejn minn dan mhu qed jiġri.
It never will be.	Qatt mhu se jkun.
But not so much.	Imma mhux daqshekk.
I think it will be good.	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb.
I wanted to go home.	Ridt immur id-dar.
But there was more to it than that.	Imma kien hemm aktar minn hekk.
Everything was working.	Kollox kien jaħdem.
Me too.	Jien ukoll.
It doesn’t always work.	Mhux dejjem jaħdem.
Really great help for us.	Tassew għajnuna kbira għalina.
I saw a man actually buy one.	Rajt raġel fil-fatt jixtri wieħed.
I knew this was it.	Kont naf li dan kien.
I did it once.	Għamilt darba.
It was so.	Kien hekk.
I’m glad she’s with me.	Jien ferħan li hi miegħi.
It will be.	Se jkun.
You say so.	Inti tgħid hekk.
This is obviously nothing like this.	Dan ovvjament mhu xejn bħal dan.
It was getting late and he was tired.	Kien sar tard u kien għajjien.
Now he is gone.	Issa huwa mar.
I wish we had more time there.	Nixtieq li kellna aktar ħin hemmhekk.
He is playing with us.	Huwa qed jilgħab magħna.
But there it is.	Imma qiegħed hemm.
Where she is now.	Fejn hi issa.
I don’t have to talk to you.	M'għandix għalfejn nitkellem miegħek.
I had had enough of that as well.	Kelli biżżejjed minn hekk ukoll.
She didn't tell me.	Hija ma tgħidli.
It would be better.	Ikun aħjar.
I don’t want that.	Ma rridx dan.
Not too much to say.	Mhux wisq xi ngħid.
I know how busy you are.	Naf kemm int okkupat.
This is one.	Din hija waħda.
We were doing that.	Konna nagħmlu hekk.
I will be with you.	Jien inkun miegħek.
You will not be able to go back there for years.	Inti mhux se tkun tista 'tmur lura hemm għal snin.
I don’t know who.	Ma nafx min.
For a while, all that.	Għal xi żmien, dak kollu.
This is what he wanted.	Dan huwa dak li kien ried.
He said he was not.	Qal li ma kienx.
And he did his best.	U għamel minn kollox.
I have mine.	Jien għandi tiegħi.
There is the truth out there.	Hemm il-verità hemmhekk.
That’s the only way to do it.	Dak hu l-uniku mod biex tagħmel dan.
Not in the afternoon.	Mhux wara nofsinhar.
But after today.	Imma wara llum.
I'll be sure to think.	Inkun żgur li naħseb.
He knew what to do.	Kien jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
That must go.	Dak irid imur.
But if she is.	Imma jekk hi.
He couldn't say anything about it.	Ta’ dan ma seta’ jew kien jgħid xejn.
He couldn’t say what it was exactly.	Ma setax jgħid dak li kien eżatt.
Now, he thought.	Issa, ħaseb.
Or more than that.	Jew aktar minn hekk.
I, this I am.	Jien, dan jien.
Maybe never.	Forsi mhux qatt.
Better yet, you can always make your own.	Aħjar, inti tista 'dejjem tagħmel tiegħek.
You are still here.	Għadek hawn.
That would never happen now.	Dak issa ma kien se jiġri qatt.
The previous afternoon.	Wara nofsinhar ta’ qabel.
The, the, the.	Le, le, le.
I’ve been thinking for a long time about how to say this.	Ħsibt għal żmien twil dwar kif ngħid dan.
I think he will be here soon.	Naħseb li dalwaqt ikun hawn.
It wasn’t much better.	Ma kinitx wisq aħjar.
I can’t think where that is.	Ma nistax naħseb fejn hu dak.
Or do, but not interested.	Jew jagħmel, imma mhux interessat.
A lot can happen.	Jista' jiġri ħafna.
I will stay here.	Jien se noqgħod hawn.
It's still there.	Għadu hemm.
I understand why you want this to be so.	Nifhem għaliex inti tixtieq li dan ikun hekk.
Did you know that.	Kont taf li kieku.
This was a job, just like any other.	Dan kien xogħol, bħal kull ieħor.
No one had seen it coming.	Ħadd ma kien ra li ġej.
But that was so long ago.	Imma dan kien tant ilu.
I wanted to be sure.	Ridt inkun ċert.
You'll take yours.	Int ser tieħu tiegħek.
I really am.	Jien tassew.
That's where we are.	Dak fejn aħna.
It has something for everyone.	Għandu xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
Or a car ?.	Jew karozza?.
No way, not until later.	L-ebda mod, mhux sa aktar tard.
I wanted to do one of these forever.	Jien ridt nagħmel waħda minn dawn għal dejjem.
There seems to be a lot that could have happened.	Jidher li hemm ħafna li seta' ġara.
If there isn’t, you can do it.	Jekk ma jkunx hemm, tista 'tagħmel dan.
This cannot be happening.	Dan ma jistax ikun qed jiġri.
There was nothing ready about it.	Ma kien hemm xejn lest dwarha.
Don't do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan.
You will be mine.	Int tkun tiegħi.
Let's go here.	Ejja mmorru hawn.
But there is.	Imma hemm.
But you came much later.	Imma int ġejt ħafna aktar tard.
About the car.	Dwar il-karozza.
I never thought it was so bad.	Qatt ma ħsibt li kien daqshekk ħażin.
Its a good size, not too small and not too big.	Daqs tajjeb tiegħu, mhux żgħir wisq u mhux kbir wisq.
I’m not sure what it is.	M'inix ċert x'inhi.
Really, that's enough.	Verament, dan huwa biżżejjed.
Never do that.	Qatt tagħmel dan.
I hear he is very good.	Nisma li hu tajjeb ħafna.
I have seen enough.	Rajt biżżejjed.
Such things.	Affarijiet bħal dawn.
This much you should know.	Dan ħafna għandek tkun taf.
What is it ?.	X'inhu?.
Now she knew why.	Issa kienet taf għaliex.
Just say you don’t want to.	Għid biss li ma tridx.
It’s such a good thing.	Hija ħaġa daqshekk tajba.
It works on everything.	Jaħdem fuq kollox.
He could not speak for hours.	Ma setax jitkellem għal sigħat.
It hasn’t been for a while.	Ma kienx għal xi żmien.
I can’t think of it that way.	Ma nistax naħseb dwarha hekk.
She knew she was beautiful.	Kienet taf li kienet sabiħa.
How does anyone know for sure ?.	Kif ikun jaf xi ħadd żgur?.
And it comes and goes pretty quickly.	U jiġi u jmur pjuttost malajr.
Only.	Biss.
Or maybe he wasn’t going to.	Jew forsi ma kienx se.
If she can.	Jekk hi tista’.
It was already going very well.	Diġà kien sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
But you are still thinking about tomorrow.	Imma għadek taħseb dwar għada.
Here it was.	Hawn kienet.
What was going on?	X'kien jiġri?
I don’t have much to really say.	M'għandix wisq xi ngħid tassew.
Not much more than that.	Mhux wisq aktar minn hekk.
It was late.	Kien tard.
I’ll be fine by morning.	Inkun tajjeb sa filgħodu.
She knows how to eat.	Hija tkun taf kif tiekol.
More than he knew about.	Aktar milli kien jaf dwarha.
Whatever happens, happens.	Dak li jiġri, jiġri.
And that is saying a lot.	U dan qed jgħid ħafna.
He speaks the truth.	Huwa jitkellem il-verità.
She wasn’t the same after all.	Hija ma kinitx l-istess wara.
It must be very late.	Għandu jkun tard ħafna.
You have a lot to say.	Għandek ħafna xi tgħid.
Definitely would.	Żgur li kieku.
And we need your help.	U għandna bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
Sure, that’s good enough.	Żgur, dan huwa tajjeb biżżejjed.
This will be more difficult.	Dan se jkun aktar diffiċli.
And it works well.	U jaħdem tajjeb.
I really, really regret it.	Jien tassew, tassew jiddispjaċini.
This is not for us.	Dan mhux le għalina.
Not out here.	Mhux hawn barra.
It was late, early in the morning, and there was not much time.	Kien tard, kmieni filgħodu, u ma kienx hemm ħafna ħin.
I was so very tired.	Kont tant għajjien ħafna.
Tell everyone what we are doing.	Għid lil kulħadd x’qed nagħmlu.
I wanted something better.	Ridt xi ħaġa aħjar.
And we are the same.	U aħna l-istess.
It will never happen.	Qatt mhu se jiġri.
More than good.	Aktar minn tajjeb.
The first is as follows.	L-ewwel huwa kif ġej.
I'm not going to do anything wrong.	Jien mhu se nagħmel xejn ħażin.
You can't do that.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan.
Both, supposedly.	It-tnejn, suppost.
She stays home all the time.	Hija toqgħod id-dar il-ħin kollu.
It was too big.	Kienet wisq kbira.
She knows it all too.	Hija taf li kollox wisq.
Maybe he is.	Forsi hu.
So he does.	Hekk jagħmel hu.
I thought about it again.	Ħsibt dwarha mill-ġdid.
He was going.	Kien sejjer.
He had to do this work.	Kellu jagħmel dan ix-xogħol.
But you know it was.	Imma taf li kien.
He says it’s easy to do.	Jgħid li huwa faċli li tagħmel.
We never do that.	Qatt ma nagħmlu hekk.
I can see again.	Nista’ nerġa’ nara.
It's all you want it to be.	Huwa dak kollu li inti tixtieq li jkun.
You don't.	Inti ma.
He was still worried.	Kien għadu inkwetat.
There is always.	Dejjem hemm.
I don’t know if we can do much more.	Ma nafx jekk nistgħux nagħmlu ħafna aktar.
He was very, very happy that evening.	Kien kuntent ħafna, ħafna dik il-lejla.
Nobody knows.	Ħadd ma taf.
I was never like that.	Qatt ma kont hekk.
Everything was there.	Kollox kien hemm.
You can't be.	Inti ma tistax tkun .
To do all that you can do on your own.	Biex tagħmel dak kollu li tista’ tagħmel waħdek.
He wanted to stay.	Ried jibqa’.
I didn’t need to.	Ma kellix bżonn.
It’s just going to get harder than here.	Huwa biss ser isir aktar diffiċli minn hawn.
A boy and a man.	Tifel u raġel.
I saw.	Rajt.
He knew what was going on.	Kien jaf x’kien jiġri.
I had no idea.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea.
They make a lot of money.	Huma jagħmlu ħafna flus.
It’s hard to be a small child.	Huwa diffiċli li tkun tifel żgħir.
Now she knew it wasn’t so.	Issa kienet taf li ma kienx hekk.
And nobody.	U ħadd.
He knew what to do.	Kien jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
No, we are not doing that.	Le, mhux qed nagħmlu hekk.
Well, now it’s too late.	Ukoll, issa huwa tard wisq.
It gets better for sure.	Jiġi aħjar żgur.
I knew how it was.	Kont naf kif kien.
This book is for everyone and for everyone.	Dan il-ktieb huwa għal kulħadd u għal kulħadd.
They are probably right.	Probabbilment għandhom raġun.
Or, it should.	Jew, għandu.
I don't think so.	Jien ma naħsibx li.
She thinks she's beautiful.	Jaħseb li hi sabiħa.
I don’t think not.	Ma naħsibx li le.
This will not be good for me.	Dan mhux se jkun tajjeb għalija.
I think it would be nice.	Naħseb li tkun sabiħa.
She wasn’t planning to stay.	Ma kinitx qed tippjana li toqgħod.
Now there.	Issa hemm.
And she is beautiful.	U hi sabiħa.
I was with someone.	Kont ma’ xi ħadd.
There was something wrong here.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa ħażina hawn.
It's just because.	Huwa biss għaliex.
And it may have surprised him.	U dan seta’ kien biss li kien sorpriż.
But if we do, he may say more to the disliked.	Imma jekk nagħmlu hekk, jista 'jgħid aktar lil min ma jħobbx.
That never happened.	Dak qatt ma ġara.
He can go where he loves.	Jista’ jmur fejn iħobb.
Tell him you will eat with me tonight.	Għid li se tiekol miegħi illejla.
Not from me.	Mhux minni.
Now he was a man.	Issa kien raġel.
Everything comes from above.	Kollox ġej minn fuq.
Definitely once told me to do something.	Żgur li xi darba qalli nagħmel xi ħaġa.
More would be better.	Aktar ikun aħjar.
He seemed surprised.	Deher li kont sorpriż.
But here’s a lot to see.	Imma hawn ħafna x'tara.
He goes back to doing nothing.	Imur lura biex ma nagħmel xejn.
I can’t just be me.	Ma nistax inkun jien biss.
We did everything wrong.	Għamilna kollox ħażin.
He is trying, as he can now.	Qed jipprova, kif jista’ issa.
Just what came next.	Biss dak li ġie wara.
It won’t be so bad.	Mhux se jkun daqshekk ħażin.
Lots and lots of money.	Ħafna u ħafna flus.
One knows better.	Wieħed jaf aħjar.
I have to do a little.	Ikolli nagħmel xi ftit.
I hope to say something more.	Jiena nispera li ngħid xi ħaġa aktar.
He needs a bad one.	Huwa għandu bżonn wieħed ħażin.
I alone, time had passed.	Jien biss, il-ħin kien għadda.
.	.
He is right, for once.	Huwa għandu raġun, għal darba.
But it’s not about being alone.	Imma mhux dwar li tkun waħdu.
They were just behind me.	Huma kienu ftit wara lili.
He left.	Huwa telaq.
Now let’s go home.	Issa ejja mmorru d-dar.
Have you ever loved? 	Qatt ma kont inħobb?
More than a man needs, for sure.	Aktar minn raġel jeħtieġ, żgur.
It's not just said.	Mhuwiex biss qal.
There is no more.	Ma jkunx hemm aktar.
A long time from now.	Żmien twil minn issa.
But he will speak soon.	Imma dalwaqt se jitkellem.
I'm not now.	Jien mhux issa.
I have no idea.	M'għandi l-ebda idea.
To me it looks like too much.	Għalija qisu wisq.
Anyone can be one.	Kulħadd jista’ jkun wieħed.
There I did it.	Kien hemm għamilt hekk.
This never happens, of course.	Dan qatt ma jiġri, ovvjament.
You have to know how to do it properly.	Għandek tkun taf kif tagħmel dan kif suppost.
Good book, he said, but.	Il-ktieb tajjeb, huwa qal, imma.
I was pretty sure it would happen.	Kont pjuttost ċert li se jiġri.
She didn't know where to go.	Hija ma kinitx taf fejn tmur.
But he did.	Imma kien jagħmel.
It would be good to get home.	Ikun tajjeb li jasal id-dar.
Don't do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan.
Better get the job done.	Aħjar tagħmel ix-xogħol.
That.	Dik.
Just really tired.	Biss verament għajjien.
And it was good.	U kienet tajba.
This has only happened from time to time.	Dan ġara biss minn żmien għal żmien.
No more people.	Mhux aktar nies.
Good for everyone.	Tajjeb għal kulħadd.
This may not be right.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx tajjeb.
This is what comes, he thought.	Dan huwa dak li jiġi, ħaseb.
It was never much.	Qatt ma kien ħafna.
He said he needed time to think.	Qal li kellu bżonn iż-żmien biex jaħseb.
Something for everyone.	Xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
He had said what he had to say and that was it.	Kien qal dak li kellu xi jgħid u dak kien hekk.
It was someone.	Kien xi ħadd.
She had to know this all the time.	Hija kellha tkun taf dan il-ħin kollu.
I thought he was a good man.	Kont ħsibt li kien raġel tajjeb.
This we want.	Dan irridu.
We will not be.	Aħna mhux se nkunu.
He is not.	Hu mhux.
Tell someone else.	Għid lil ħadd ieħor.
I don’t know what that is.	Ma nafx x'inhu dak.
It just gets better.	Huwa biss isir aħjar.
He looked tired.	Huwa deher għajjien.
And it wasn’t.	U ma kienx.
It's very good.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna.
I did it myself.	Jien għamilt jien.
I'm sure it will be fine.	Jien ċert li se jkun tajjeb.
He has to work on that.	Huwa jkollu jaħdem fuq dan.
It was too much for us.	Kien wisq għalina.
I was in school.	Kont kont l-iskola.
They are many now.	Huma ħafna issa.
Which is what happened.	Li huwa dak li ġara.
So it usually works.	Hekk normalment jaħdem.
I think he is here.	Naħseb li qiegħed hawn.
I love everything.	Inħobb kollox.
I don’t buy any of this.	Jien ma nixtri xejn minn dan.
This is not a good thing.	Din mhix xi ħaġa tajba.
This had never happened to me.	Dan qatt ma kien ġara lili.
Just not today.	Biss mhux illum.
It was home.	Kienet id-dar.
Please come, as soon as you can.	Jekk jogħġbok ejja, malajr kemm tista'.
I've never been this way before.	Qatt ma kont hekk qabel.
I wanted to know everything.	Ridt inkun naf kollox.
I've never been this way before.	Qatt ma kont hekk qabel.
Not sure where to go from here.	Mhux ċert fejn tmur minn hawn.
Not much more than that.	Mhux wisq aktar minn hekk.
You are the first.	Int l-ewwel.
I don’t talk much about it.	Ma tantx nitkellem dwarha.
Everyone knows you.	Kulħadd jaf li int.
That was not the case.	Dan ma kienx hekk.
It was never enough.	Qatt ma kien biżżejjed.
And they were.	U kienu .
I can never.	Jien ma nista qatt.
I'll believe it.	Jien ser nemmen.
With that, on.	Ma 'dak, fuq.
He didn’t know why he was, either.	Hu ma kienx jaf għaliex kien, lanqas.
I have to say no.	Għandi ngħid le.
This is obviously wrong.	Dan huwa ovvjament ħażin.
That seems to be where he is now.	Jidher li dak huwa fejn hu issa.
We can do all this.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan kollu.
He doesn’t talk much but he comes.	Ma tantx jitkellem imma ġej.
They were there now.	Kienu hemm issa.
If not I have another idea.	Jekk le għandi idea oħra.
And now ready.	U issa lest.
Mine was better.	Tiegħi kien aħjar.
And you can't.	U ma tistax.
Not just school.	Mhux l-iskola biss.
And after that.	U wara dak.
That’s not who he is.	Dak mhux min hu.
I would.	Inkun.
He had taken everyone with him.	Huwa kien ħa lil kulħadd miegħu.
There was nothing more she had to do.	Ma kien hemm xejn aktar li kellha tagħmel.
I need to understand something else.	Għandi bżonn nifhem xi ħaġa oħra.
Now he knows better.	Issa jaf aħjar.
We need to do something.	Għandna bżonn nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
I have never seen this before.	Qatt ma rajt dan qabel.
I had never seen one before.	Qatt ma kont rajt waħda qabel.
We do things.	Aħna nagħmlu l-affarijiet.
It wasn’t bad.	Ma kienx ħażin.
He knew nothing of this.	Ma kien jaf xejn minn dan.
This is not so.	Dan mhux hekk.
He will do his best.	Se tagħmel dak kollu li jista’.
Everyone can see.	Kulħadd jista 'jara.
people like.	nies bħal.
I know it was good.	Naf li kien tajjeb.
It's hard.	Huwa diffiċli.
And now it's too late.	U issa jista’ jkun tard wisq.
I can’t believe it has arrived.	Ma nistax nemmen li wasal.
All this time.	Dan il-ħin kollu.
He can't stay.	Ma jistax jibqa’.
I can do something for you.	Nista' nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik.
It's not bad.	Huwa mhux ħażin.
It would be easy if they were.	Ikun faċli kieku kienu.
I was glad I finished.	Kont ferħan li lest.
It happens to be what happens.	Jiġri li jkun dak li jiġri.
I don't know.	Jien ma nafx.
Come on someone.	Ġej xi ħadd.
I wanted more than that.	Ridt aktar minn hekk.
But no one was doing that.	Imma ħadd ma kien jagħmel dan.
He is worried about this.	Huwa inkwetat dwar dan.
He had no idea he was going to leave like that.	Ma kellux idea li se jitlaq hekk.
He does not speak.	Hu ma jitkellem.
Later here now.	Aktar tard issa hawn.
It was like everything else.	Kien bħal kull ħaġa oħra.
This is how it should be.	Dan huwa kif għandu jkun.
He didn't want to.	Ma kienx ried hekk.
Time was of the essence.	Iż-żmien kien xejn.
Everyone is right.	Kulħadd għandu raġun.
And how much is.	U kemm hu.
That book is not mine.	Dak il-ktieb mhuwiex tiegħi.
Maybe that’s the only thing you need to know.	Forsi hija l-unika ħaġa li għandek bżonn tkun taf.
He can only do one job at a time.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel xogħol wieħed biss kull darba.
If she's here, fine.	Jekk hi hawn, tajjeb.
I have a lot of fun.	Jien nieħu gost ħafna.
I will, too.	Ikolli, ukoll.
This actually happened.	Dan fil-fatt ġara.
This was going to be easy.	Dan kien se jkun faċli.
It was all mine.	Kien kollu tiegħi.
They felt time to do it.	Ħassu żmien li tagħmel dan.
He couldn't think anymore.	Ma setax jaħseb aktar.
Afraid not to.	Jibża li ma.
I didn’t think anything else about it.	Ma ħsibt xejn ieħor dwarha.
Or try to do something about it.	Jew ipprova tagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
You can never tell.	Qatt ma tista’ tgħid.
But there is more to it than that.	Imma hemm aktar minn hekk.
No one knows who did this or why.	Ħadd ma jaf min għamel dan jew għaliex.
This happens, and it happens a lot.	Dan jiġri, u jiġri ħafna.
You can do everything.	Tista 'tagħmel dak kollu.
And if you do.	U jekk tagħmel hekk.
It's hard to please.	Hija diffiċli biex jekk jogħġbok.
There could be something.	Jista 'jkun hemm xi ħaġa.
Everything works properly.	Kollox jaħdem kif suppost.
He did not know what to think.	Ma kienx jaf x’se jaħseb.
You should probably just go now.	Inti għandek probabbilment biss tmur issa.
It should.	Għandu.
I, I, I.	Jien, jien, jien.
I hear but I hear nothing.	Nisma’ imma ma nisma’ xejn.
I, of course, say no.	Jien, ovvjament, ngħid le.
It could be more.	Jista 'jkun aktar.
And another thing.	U ħaġa oħra.
If only she didn't.	Jekk biss hi ma.
She just did so.	Hija għadha kif għamlet hekk.
I did things.	Għamilt affarijiet.
I thought wrong.	Ħsibt ħażin.
But he wouldn’t have.	Imma ma kienx ikollu.
Can it happen?	Jista' jiġri?
So much the better, perhaps.	Tant aħjar, forsi.
He did not tell anyone what he had seen.	Ma qal lil ħadd dak li kien ra.
But I doubt I can do that.	Imma niddubita li nista’ nagħmel dan.
He said a little.	Qal ftit.
Whatever.	Tkun xi tkun.
What is it for you ?.	X'inhu għalik?.
That should say it all.	Dan għandu jgħid kollox.
This is just what works for me.	Dan huwa biss dak li jaħdem għalija.
I just couldn’t get the job done.	I biss ma stajtx nagħmel ix-xogħol.
And it may not be the only one.	U jista 'ma jkunx l-uniku wieħed.
It's with me.	Huwa miegħi.
It’s a big problem right now.	Hija problema kbira bħalissa.
He needed some work.	Huwa kien jeħtieġ xi xogħol.
Today I will do a lot.	Illum se nagħmel ħafna.
This is back.	Dan huwa lura.
He was a happy man.	Kien raġel ferħan.
And it’s probably a good thing you don’t.	U probabbilment hija ħaġa tajba li ma tagħmilx.
I know you want some.	Naf li trid xi ftit.
Late is late.	Tard huwa tard.
No one will have to know.	Ħadd ma jkollu jkun jaf.
Most people don't.	Ħafna nies ma.
You know he will do it alone.	Taf li se jagħmel dan waħdu.
This will not happen here.	Dan mhux se jiġri hawn.
She is out.	Hija barra.
You did it.	Inti għamilt dan.
But it was taking too long.	Imma kien qed jieħu wisq żmien.
Mod.	Mod.
I wonder if this is right.	Nistaqsi jekk dan hux tajjeb.
I had never been here.	Qatt ma kelli ġejt hawn.
I can tell you too.	Nista’ ngħidlek ukoll.
We will do better.	Aħna se nagħmlu aħjar.
Maybe so.	Forsi jiġri hekk.
My friend did.	Ħabib tiegħi għamel.
I'm fine now.	Jien tajjeb issa.
I have never seen anything before.	Qatt ma rajt xejn qabel.
You can say more.	Tista 'tgħid aktar.
It wouldn’t be so bad.	Ma jkunx daqshekk ħażin.
I couldn’t do that.	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan.
I just thought you should know.	Ħsibt biss li għandek tkun taf.
She knew he knew.	Kienet taf li hu kien jaf.
That seemed likely.	Dak deher probabbli.
Obviously, there was no one with him at the time.	Ovvjament, ma kien hemm ħadd miegħu dak iż-żmien.
Or if there is anyone out there.	Jew jekk hemm xi ħadd hemmhekk.
But he didn’t need to.	Imma ma kellux bżonn.
Your time has passed.	Il-ħin tiegħek għadda.
Maybe I’m doing this wrong.	Forsi qed nagħmel dan ħażin.
We’ve never had anything like this happen around here.	Qatt ma kellna xi ħaġa bħal din jiġri madwar hawn.
It was now noon.	Issa kien nofsinhar.
I thought a lot about it there.	Ħsibt ħafna dwarha hemmhekk.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
That could be me.	Dak jista 'jkun jien.
Now he just seemed worried.	Issa hu biss deher inkwetat.
Good to be tired.	Tajjeb li tkun għajjien.
He needs to do a better job.	Jeħtieġ li jagħmel xogħol aħjar.
But that’s what we have.	Imma huwa dak li għandna.
I’ve heard of a few people doing this.	Smajt bi ftit nies li jagħmlu dan.
I said no more.	għidt mhux aktar.
This seems to work well.	Dan jidher li jaħdem tajjeb.
But you know that.	Imma int taf li.
Okay, but we don't have enough time.	Tajjeb, imma m’għandniex ħin biżżejjed.
How long it seems.	Kemm ilu jidher.
There will be more on this later.	Se jkun hemm aktar dwar dan aktar tard.
And it was just fast.	U kien biss malajr.
He had a lot of fun.	Huwa ħa gost ħafna.
I didn’t really want the truth.	Ma tantx ridt il-verità.
But not often.	Imma mhux spiss.
I don’t know when you’re here.	Ma nafx meta tkun hawn.
They felt tired.	Ħassu għajjien.
I don’t know if this is going to be a problem.	Ma nafx jekk dan hux ser ikun problema.
Not coming back.	Mhux ġej lura.
But he wasn’t the only one.	Imma ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
If we only knew what was coming.	Kieku konna nafu x’kien ġej.
But this is my job.	Imma dan huwa xogħol tiegħi.
Now, it’s time to do it.	Issa, wasal iż-żmien li tagħmel dan.
That will be a lot of work.	Dak se jkun ħafna xogħol.
He asked again.	Huwa talab għal darba oħra.
I knew quite a bit.	Kont naf pjuttost.
.	.
I will go to work later tomorrow.	Jien se mmur xogħol aktar tard għada.
John was glad.	John kien ferħan.
Well, none of that more.	Ukoll, xejn minn dak aktar.
But it does more than that.	Imma jagħmel aktar minn hekk.
That was too much for you.	Dan kien wisq għalik.
It was a beautiful morning.	Kienet filgħodu sabiħa.
He appeared.	Huwa deher.
But here it was.	Imma hawn kien.
But we don’t have that.	Imma aħna m'għandniex dan.
But that was many years ago now.	Imma dan kien ħafna snin ilu issa.
After a long time it was quite still.	Wara żmien twil kien pjuttost għadu.
This has hardly happened to us.	Dan ma tantx ġara għalina.
That was great for me.	Dak kien kbir għalija.
You can do the same thing.	Tista 'tagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
I was also surprised.	Jien ukoll kont sorpriż.
But this is a hard thing to think about.	Imma din hija ħaġa diffiċli biex taħseb dwarha.
But you can do that for me.	Imma tista’ tagħmel dan għalija.
He said it will not happen.	Qal li mhux se jiġri.
Be prepared for this.	Ikun lest għal dan.
Everyone said that.	Kulħadd qal dan.
And you know why.	U tista’ tkun taf għaliex.
But there is a way.	Imma hemm li jista 'jkun hemm mod.
It also didn’t look good.	Ma deherx ukoll li kien tajjeb.
You know that.	Taf li int.
Just a little.	Ftit biss.
Things to do and not to do.	Affarijiet li tagħmel u li ma tagħmilx.
I’m not sure of anything really.	M'inix ċert minn xejn tassew.
I know this may not be what I wanted.	Naf li dan ma jistax ikun dak li ridt.
He never had to live.	Hu qatt ma kellu jgħix.
Another was that it was fun talking to him.	Ieħor kien li kien gost jitkellem miegħu.
Which, of course, she did.	Li, ovvjament, għamlet.
This happens.	Dan jiġri.
I did one.	Għamilt waħda.
I have no idea why.	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex.
Now everything is back.	Issa kollox huwa lura.
This is how long.	Dan huwa kemm żmien.
I'm having a hard time.	Qed ikolli żmien diffiċli.
He needs some time.	Huwa għandu bżonn ftit ħin.
Everyone left.	Kulħadd telaq.
He doesn’t want to think.	Ma jridx jaħseb.
I don’t know who they were.	Ma nafx min kienu.
I think that was the problem.	Naħseb li dik kienet il-problema.
But she is not yours.	Imma hi mhix tiegħek.
I was doing whatever she wanted.	Jien kont nagħmel dak kollu li trid hi.
It doesn’t work very well.	Ma tantx jaħdem.
I think you know.	Naħseb li taf.
This happened years ago.	Dan ġara snin ilu.
I can’t believe he’s doing this.	Ma nistax nemmen li qed jagħmel dan.
And you can tell that in the room.	U tista 'tgħid li fil-kamra.
Unless you are interested.	Sakemm ma tkunx interessat.
He had to stay on.	Kellu jibqa 'fuq.
But of course, this is wrong.	Imma ovvjament, dan huwa ħażin.
I think we can.	Naħseb li nistgħu.
It was for nothing.	Kienet għal xejn.
If anyone can, it's him.	Jekk xi ħadd jista’, ikun hu.
He didn’t even know how he got here.	Lanqas ma kien jaf kif wasal hawn.
Unless, of course, not.	Sakemm, ovvjament, mhux.
And harder than you want it to be.	U aktar diffiċli milli tixtieq li tkun.
I had done the same.	Jien kont għamilt l-istess.
But one thing.	Imma ħaġa waħda.
Nothing is so difficult.	Xejn mhu daqshekk diffiċli.
You want another, he says.	Trid ieħor, jgħid.
That's pretty little.	Dak pjuttost ftit.
And we were right.	U kellna raġun.
Sometimes she did.	Xi drabi hi għamlet dan.
Come home with me.	Ejja d-dar miegħi.
I'm sure that will happen.	Jien ċert li jiġri.
He doesn't have time for that.	M’għandux ħin għal dan.
I can understand.	Nista' nifhem.
I was watching to see how he did it.	Jien kont qed nara biex nara kif tagħmel dan.
I was very surprised.	Kont sorpriż ħafna.
It is my job to see these things.	Huwa xogħol tiegħi li nara dawn l-affarijiet.
Ask where she was from.	Staqsa minn fejn kienet.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Hu x’inhu, jaf dak kollu li qed nagħmlu.
Not the same.	Mhux l-istess.
I'm going home today.	Jien illum sejjer id-dar.
It looked good.	Deher tajjeb.
And he saw more.	U ra aktar.
It was really here.	Kien verament hawn.
This he will never do.	Dan qatt mhu se jagħmel.
It was something big at the time.	Kienet xi ħaġa kbira dak iż-żmien.
I had no idea it was going to be so beautiful.	Ma kellix idea li se tkun hekk sabiħa.
You don’t even think of going back.	Lanqas ma taħseb li tmur lura.
After he died, everything went wrong.	Wara li miet, kollox mar ħażin.
You don’t want a man.	Inti ma tridx raġel.
I have to say this.	Irrid ngħid dan.
He made sure.	Huwa għamel ċert.
Not making friends.	Mhux tagħmel ħbieb.
It was still good.	Kien għadu tajjeb.
It will be the same one.	Se tkun l-istess waħda.
That's what it is.	Huwa dak li hu.
No help there.	L-ebda għajnuna hemmhekk.
I'm so tired.	Jien tant għajjien.
I'm better now.	Jien aħjar issa.
There are no problems with this.	M'hemm l-ebda problemi b'dan.
I'm not so much.	Jien ma tantx hekk.
This is how you do it.	Dan huwa kif tagħmel dan.
Well, the same thing again.	Ukoll, l-istess ħaġa mill-ġdid.
He didn’t even need to say much like that.	Lanqas ma kellu bżonn jgħid ħafna hekk.
Neither do I.	Jien lanqas jien.
This is a very bad time.	Dan huwa żmien ħażin ħafna.
No one was ready to speak.	Ħadd ma kien lest jitkellem.
Think on your own.	Taħseb waħedha.
You have to be who you are.	Trid tkun min int.
I don't want to see it.	Ma rridx li tara.
I’m not so scared.	Jien mhux daqshekk nibża.
You said it before.	Inti għidt qabel.
I can speak.	Kapaċi nitkellem.
Ready?	Lest?
It’s about here, actually.	Huwa madwar hawn, fil-fatt.
Nor do we.	Lanqas għandna.
It seems they are just.	Jidher li huma biss.
No one could have done this better.	Ħadd ma seta’ jagħmel dan aħjar.
You can and will be great again.	Tista 'u tkun kbira mill-ġdid.
He couldn't know.	Ma setax jaf.
I went wrong.	Jien mort ħażin.
That's exactly what happened.	Eżatt hekk sar.
There wasn’t much time.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna ħin.
Not good to talk about.	Mhux tajjeb li titkellem.
Your home is a job in progress.	Id-dar tiegħek hija xogħol li qed isir.
But almost everyone is very sure.	Imma kważi kulħadd huwa ċert ħafna.
Or more than that.	Jew aktar minn hekk.
Each one is there.	Kull wieħed hemm.
I do both.	Jien nagħmel it-tnejn.
He must be so worried.	Huwa għandu jkun tant inkwetat.
But apparently he does.	Imma milli jidher jagħmel hekk.
Come on, good friend.	Ejja, ħabib tajjeb.
You are not his friend.	M'intix ħabib tiegħu.
Everything and everyone.	Kollox u kulħadd.
I still have so many friends there.	Għadni tant ħbieb hemmhekk.
She was so beautiful.	Kienet tant sabiħa.
If you want, you will.	Jekk trid, int se.
I understand what happened there.	Nifhem x’ġara hemmhekk.
It could be great again.	Jista 'jkun kbir mill-ġdid.
Yours as well.	Tiegħek ukoll.
It does not.	Dan ma jagħmilx.
Same here.	L-istess hawn.
It definitely works for me.	Żgur li jaħdem għalija.
I know you want me.	Naf li trid miegħi.
If you already have one, right for you.	Jekk diġà għandek waħda, tajjeb għalik.
No one will ever know.	Ħadd qatt mhu se jkun jaf.
I'm not ready.	Jien m'inix lest.
I never wanted anything more than that.	Qatt ma ridt xejn aktar minn dan.
This is your home.	Din hija d-dar tiegħek.
He played badly.	Huwa kellu ħażin.
I have never said anything like this before.	Qatt ma għidt xi ħaġa bħal din qabel.
Morning passed for afternoon and afternoon for evening.	Filgħodu għadda għal wara nofsinhar u wara nofsinhar għal filgħaxija.
He was not happy for a long time.	Huwa ma kienx kuntent għal żmien twil.
I go talk to him.	Immur nitkellem miegħu.
Well there you have it.	Ukoll hemm għandek.
It wasn’t that one.	Ma kienx dak wieħed.
She is as beautiful as ever.	Hija sabiħa daqs qatt qabel.
It seems easy enough !.	Jidher faċli biżżejjed!.
I don’t think it will.	Ma naħsibx li se.
But how could it be too late?	Imma kif seta’ jkun tard?
It would be great.	Ikun kbir.
Maybe nothing like this happened.	Forsi ma ġara xejn bħal dan.
That's when you know.	Dak huwa meta tkun taf.
If it's the latter, you do.	Jekk huwa l-aħħar, inti tagħmel.
I probably will.	I probabbilment se.
So be it.	Hekk ikun.
At that time I was a small child.	Dak iż-żmien kont tifel żgħir.
As long as he was happy.	Sakemm kien kuntent.
He is willing to do that.	Huwa lest li jagħmel dan.
I'm doing a lot of work.	Qed nagħmel ħafna xogħol.
But that’s not really the truth.	Imma dik mhix verament il-verità.
When that happens, it happens.	Meta jiġri hekk, jiġri.
As it happened.	Kif ġara.
It works well.	Jaħdem tajjeb.
I couldn't hear.	Ma stajtx nisma.
I was sure this was a bad idea.	Kont ċert li din kienet idea ħażina.
Or for a little more.	Jew għal ftit aktar.
Or tomorrow evening.	Jew għada filgħaxija.
Not good or bad, it's just.	Mhux tajjeb jew ħażin, huwa biss.
For a very long time.	Għal żmien twil ħafna.
That's a good one, 'she says.	Dik hija waħda tajba,' tgħid hi.
You are going to make one.	Inti tmur tagħmel waħda.
You can't be my friend anymore.	Inti ma tistax tkun ħabib tiegħi aktar.
Well, you do.	Ukoll, inti tagħmel.
There is something wrong there.	Hemm xi ħaġa ħażina hemmhekk.
But this is never enough.	Imma dan qatt mhu biżżejjed.
No way is good.	L-ebda mod mhu tajjeb.
I will listen rather than talk.	Jien se nisma’ aktar milli nitkellem.
I want you to know something.	Irrid li tkun taf xi ħaġa.
That would be great.	Dan ikun kbir.
And it was something else.	U kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
And no one did.	U ħadd ma għamel.
but you can't do that.	imma ma tistax tagħmel dan.
I still want to.	Għadni irrid.
No one else.	Ħadd ieħor.
Lots of time.	Ħafna ħin.
There will only be this.	Se jkun hemm dan biss.
That has been happening for a long time.	Dak ilu jiġri.
This would probably be easier.	Dan probabbilment ikun aktar faċli.
A lot of time has passed.	Għadda ħafna żmien.
You’re right, probably.	Għandek raġun, probabbilment.
I thought I was the only one.	Ħsibt li kont l-uniku wieħed.
If you can't, fine too.	Jekk ma tistax, tajjeb ukoll.
She doesn’t want me.	Hi ma tridx lili.
I really hope so.	Tassew nittama li hekk.
I didn't have to say that.	Jien ma kellix ngħid hekk.
You never know !.	Qatt ma tkun taf!.
And that seems to be a lot.	U li jidher li huma ħafna.
Many times.	Ħafna drabi.
Tomorrow we go home.	Għada mmorru d-dar.
I know you can do that.	Naf li tista’ tagħmel dan.
I don’t even know how to do that.	Lanqas naf kif tagħmel dan.
He had never seen such a thing before.	Hu qatt ma kien ra ħaġa bħal din qabel.
Now.	Issa.
I thought the same thing.	Ħsibt l-istess ħaġa.
It's still good.	Għadu tajjeb.
He never wanted anything else.	Hu qatt ma ried xi ħaġa oħra.
Maybe we’ll never know.	Forsi qatt ma nkunu nafu.
He did it unintentionally.	Huwa għamel dan bla ma jrid.
You don’t want to talk.	Ma tridx titkellem.
I had never seen anything like it.	Qatt ma kien ra xi ħaġa bħal din.
No one knew who he was at the time.	Ħadd ma kien jaf min kien dak iż-żmien.
But very glad to be back.	Imma ferħan ħafna li qed lura.
I didn’t know you were.	Ma kontx naf li int.
He says no.	Jgħid le.
Who is it? 	Min hi?
He was never planning.	Hu qatt ma kien qed jippjana.
Nobody knew what happened.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x’ġara.
And and it's a little better there.	U u huwa ftit aħjar hemm.
You didn't.	Inti ma kontx.
It became a thing.	Sar ħaġa.
I hope you know what you are doing.	Nittama li tkun taf x'qed tagħmel.
I can already say.	Diġà nista' ngħid.
That's a lot of money.	Dak ħafna flus.
And this is difficult.	U dan huwa diffiċli.
You know if.	Taf jekk.
It was not there.	Ma kienx hemm.
You'll see, you'll see.	Int ser tara, int ser tara.
He wants to talk.	Irid jitkellem.
He is coming this afternoon.	Huwa ġej illum wara nofsinhar.
Too much or too little.	Kemm hu wisq jew ftit wisq.
I will do so.	Jien se nagħmel hekk.
I don't know how he did it.	Ma nafx kif għamel hekk.
I just wanted to.	Ridt biss.
More than that, he knew it was the truth.	Aktar minn hekk, kien jaf li kienet il-verità.
It's so good.	Huwa daqshekk tajjeb.
It was a great year for him.	Kienet sena kbira għalih.
There was no one else there.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor hemmhekk.
I'm not sure it ever will.	M'inix ċert li qatt se.
Not a problem.	Mhux problema.
You are here a lot.	Inti hawn ħafna.
And it's great.	U huwa kbir.
I didn’t want that.	Jien ma ridtx dan.
It really was doing too much.	Verament kien qed isir wisq.
It was a great thing to do.	Kienet xi ħaġa kbira li tagħmel.
Something he had never seen before.	Xi ħaġa li qatt ma ra qabel.
It must be hard for him to say anything.	Għandu jkun diffiċli għalih li jgħid xi ħaġa.
That was good.	Li kien tajjeb.
She was beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa.
I don’t think anyone knew he was there.	Ma naħsibx li ħadd ma kien jaf li kien hemm.
No one can do this for you.	Ħadd ma jista’ jagħmel dan għalik.
He can't sit down.	Ma jistax joqgħod bilqiegħda.
It was your book.	Kien il-ktieb tiegħek.
That would be.	Dan ikun.
I didn’t know you would be here.	Ma kontx naf li inti tkun hawn.
And here you are.	U hawn int.
More on this here.	Aktar dwar dan hawn.
I don't want to talk to you.	Ma rridx nitkellem miegħek.
I just couldn’t.	Jien biss ma stajtx.
No, not really.	Le, mhux verament.
''.	''.
Well, until.	Ukoll, sakemm.
A bad thing happens here.	Ħaġa ħażina jiġri hawn.
No one had died.	Ħadd ma kien miet.
Is your car there?	Dik il-karozza tiegħek hemm?
If something happens.	Jekk jiġri xi ħaġa.
That was it.	Li kien.
He is a good man.	Huwa raġel tajjeb.
We can be us.	Nistgħu nkunu aħna.
I didn’t want to be out there.	Ma ridtx inkun hemm barra.
Maybe he is.	Forsi hu.
It's all his.	Hi kollha tiegħu.
You need to do this.	Għandek bżonn tagħmel dan.
Everything seems to be working.	Kollox jidher li qed jaħdem.
She had me, and she knew it.	Hija kellha lili, u kienet taf dan.
I have to go now, he said.	Ikolli mmur issa, qal.
Maybe so, but no one will ever know.	Forsi hekk hu, imma ħadd qatt mhu se jkun jaf.
He was leaving.	Kien jitlaq.
We were pretty tough.	Konna pjuttost diffiċli.
They were here for something.	Kienu hawn għal xi ħaġa.
But that wasn’t me.	Imma dak ma kontx jien.
That was a great thing.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa kbira.
I can’t believe it works so well, but it does.	Ma nistax nemmen li jaħdem daqshekk tajjeb, imma hekk jagħmel.
Nothing like this, ever again.	Xejn bħal dan, qatt aktar.
It could be something else.	Jista 'jkun xi ħaġa oħra.
For me this was great.	Għalija dan kien kbir.
It's been a while.	Ilu ftit.
I have to do this.	Ikolli nagħmel dan.
We had a good time.	Kellna żmien tajjeb.
I wasn’t good enough.	Jien ma kontx tajjeb biżżejjed.
Today we did.	Illum għamilna.
I don’t think it should be.	Ma naħsibx li għandu jkun.
This works pretty well, too.	Dan jaħdem pjuttost tajjeb, ukoll.
It should be here, but it’s late.	Għandu jkun hawn, imma wasal tard.
I think you will be really happy.	Naħseb li tkun tassew kuntent.
Same as.	L-istess bħal.
She can go, she can't.	Hija tista 'tmur, hi tista' le.
There seemed to be nothing.	Deher li ma kien hemm xejn.
She was never that.	Hija qatt ma kienet dik.
We can do that.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
She didn’t and there he was.	Hija ma kinitx u hemm kien.
By now he was about a year old.	Sa issa kien ikollu madwar sena.
Maybe we can.	Forsi nistgħu.
And that wasn’t all.	U dan ma kienx kollox.
It's not bad.	Huwa mhux ħażin.
But you can’t be late.	Imma ma tistax toqgħod tard.
I didn’t want to sit down.	Ma ridtx noqgħod bilqiegħda.
You always want another one.	Dejjem tixtieq li jkun hemm waħda oħra.
I can't say more.	Ma nistax ngħid aktar.
I'm doing very well.	Jien sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
There was one first.	Kien hemm wieħed l-ewwel.
No, you need someone there, right.	Le, għandek bżonn xi ħadd hemmhekk, hux.
One should not be surprised.	Wieħed m'għandux ikun sorpriż.
He can speak now.	Jista 'jitkellem issa.
Please try to do the same.	Jekk jogħġbok ipprova tagħmel l-istess.
I can't be.	Ma nistax inkun.
It is so not so.	Huwa hekk mhux hekk.
But he had done nothing.	Imma ma kien għamel xejn.
He can sit around for a while.	Huwa jista 'joqgħod madwar għal ftit ħin.
We both would.	Aħna t-tnejn kieku.
But none of this is enough.	Imma xejn minn dan mhu biżżejjed.
I’m supposed to make things easier.	Suppost nagħmel l-affarijiet aktar faċli.
Now that’s great !.	Issa dak huwa kbir!.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
We want to.	Irridu .
I just wanted to stay out.	Ridt biss noqgħod barra.
It's better than nothing.	Huwa aħjar minn xejn.
More on that in a little while.	Aktar dwar dan fi ftit.
Either this works or it doesn’t.	Jew dan jaħdem jew le.
This was not to happen.	Dan ma kellux jiġri.
I want to be a teacher.	Irrid inkun għalliem.
You have seen it happen before.	Inti rajt jiġri qabel.
You can't.	Inti ma tistax.
And not good.	U mhux tajjeb.
Now he was leaving.	Issa kien jitlaq.
Everyone does it.	Kulħadd jagħmel dan.
I was ready to go.	Kont lest li mmur.
It’s nobody coming here.	Huwa ħadd li ġej hawn.
This was not.	Dan ma kienx.
He needs to see.	Għandu bżonn jara.
You can’t do everything on your own.	Ma tistax tagħmel kollox waħdek.
From those who don't have it.	Minn min m’għandux.
Not that he wanted to be.	Mhux li ried ikun.
It was very good.	Kien tajjeb ħafna.
She is who she is.	Hija min hi.
He was scared.	Huwa kien jibża.
He needs to talk.	Jeħtieġ li jitkellem.
Sorry how hard it was.	Jiddispjaċini kemm kien diffiċli.
He didn't do a very good job.	Ma tantx għamel xogħol tajjeb.
Everything seemed to go well.	Kollox deher li mar tajjeb.
We are already back.	Aħna diġà lura.
It came together really well.	Ġie flimkien tassew tajjeb.
Surely he knew better than that.	Żgur li kien jaf aħjar minn hekk.
The truth is, no one knows where it came from.	Il-verità hi li ħadd ma jaf minn fejn ġie.
And much more.	U ħafna aktar.
There is no one there.	M'hemm ħadd hemm.
There can only be one.	Jista' jkun hemm wieħed biss.
Together we can do it.	Flimkien nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
That’s really about it.	Dak huwa verament dwar dan.
You have no idea how great it was for me.	M'għandekx idea kemm kien kbir għalija.
Time only says !.	Il-ħin biss jgħid!.
This never goes away.	Dan qatt ma jmur.
How can you tell?	Kif tista' tgħid?
And he is right about that.	U għandu raġun dwar dan.
It has been there for some time.	Hemmhekk kien għal xi żmien.
We don't.	Aħna ma .
And now it’s done.	U issa sar.
You are always doing too much.	Dejjem qed tagħmel wisq.
He couldn't see anything wrong.	Ma seta’ jara xejn ħażin.
Everyone will want to work with you.	Kulħadd ikun irid jaħdem miegħek.
I never was.	Qatt ma kont.
I hope you do.	Nittama li tagħmel dan.
Everyone tried.	Kulħadd ipprova.
We can be here forever.	Nistgħu nkunu hawn għal dejjem.
She had it there.	Kellha hemmhekk.
I will never do that to any of my son.	Qatt mhu se nagħmel hekk lil xi tifel tiegħi.
You were beautiful.	Inti kont sabiħa.
I need help to say enough is enough.	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna biex ngħid biżżejjed huwa biżżejjed.
It has an easy job.	Għandu xogħol faċli.
No, she is not.	Le, hi mhix.
But not there.	Imma mhux hemm.
I love this car.	Inħobb din il-karozza.
But so far.	Imma sa issa.
I know nothing about it.	Ma naf xejn dwarha.
No one ever has.	Ħadd qatt ma għandu.
To someone, to someone.	Lil xi ħadd, lil xi ħadd.
I had that.	Kelli dak.
What is this.	X'inhu dan.
It actually takes a lot of work.	Fil-fatt jieħu ħafna xogħol.
I had no problem with that.	Ma kellix problema b'dan.
She not only was beautiful.	Hija mhux biss kienet sabiħa.
This dog once belonged to someone else.	Dan il-kelb darba kien ta’ xi ħadd ieħor.
You have to go there.	Għandek tmur hemm.
I didn’t want to, either.	Jien ma ridtx, lanqas.
Everyone knew his job.	Kull wieħed kien jaf ix-xogħol tiegħu.
I will be trying this.	Se nkun qed nipprova dan.
It has everything there.	Għandu kollox hemmhekk.
It should be good.	Għandu jkun tajjeb.
He wanted to win.	Ried jirbaħ.
He was still too young to drive.	Kien għadu żgħir wisq biex isuq.
I just want to be home.	Irrid inkun biss id-dar.
Before that could happen, someone had to talk.	Qabel dan seta’ jiġri, xi ħadd kellu jitkellem.
You were a boy.	Inti kont tifel.
That’s good of me.	Dak tajjeb minni.
It wasn't long ago.	Ma kienx ilu.
It may be best to do one thing at a time.	Jista 'jkun aħjar li tagħmel ħaġa waħda kull darba.
Let me tell you more about the former.	Ħa ngħid aktar dwar l-ewwel.
He knows now.	Jaf issa.
I can't, my friend.	Ma nistax, ħabib tiegħi.
Both do very well.	It-tnejn jagħmlu tajjeb ħafna.
Here's why.	Hawn hu għaliex.
But he leaves again.	Imma jerġa’ jitlaq.
It was just there.	Kien hemm eżatt.
He looked at me.	Huwa ħares lejn lili.
Don't take this.	M'għandekx tieħu dan.
I don’t think you do.	Ma naħsibx li tagħmel.
But not everyone can do that.	Imma kulħadd ma jistax jagħmel dan.
It doesn’t seem to be happening.	Ma jidhirx li qed jiġri.
I have to say this.	Ikolli ngħid dan.
She was as beautiful to me as ever.	Kienet sabiħa għalija daqskemm qatt kienet.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Ma nafx x'inhu jiġri.
He was never friends with me.	Qatt ma kien ħbieb miegħi.
Every time I do this, it makes it a lot easier for me.	Kull darba li tagħmel dan, tagħmel dan ħafna aktar faċli għalija.
Obviously he would have much more than that.	Ovvjament kien ikollu ħafna aktar minn hekk.
I have to say no.	Ikolli ngħid le.
He was right about all this.	Huwa kellu raġun dwar dan kollu.
It's good for you.	Hija tajba għalik.
Nothing there when he looked.	Xejn hemm meta ħares.
Please don't talk anymore.	Jekk jogħġbok ma titkellem aktar.
She really is who you think she is.	Hi tassew min taħseb li hi.
As it should be.	Kif għandu jkun.
It had happened that way.	Kien ġara hekk.
They are like everyone else.	Huma bħal kulħadd.
Come with me.	Ejja miegħi.
.	.
And here I am now.	U hawn jien issa.
I just want to be home again.	Irrid biss inkun id-dar mill-ġdid.
That’s how we know each other.	Hekk nafu lil xulxin.
This has happened before.	Dan ġara qabel.
Some people will do very well.	Xi nies se jagħmlu tajjeb ħafna.
It's too hard.	Huwa diffiċli wisq.
It was the same.	Kien l-istess.
But this is not happening.	Imma dan mhux qed jiġri.
I did everything.	Għamilt kollox.
There is someone who must have seen something.	Hemm xi ħadd li jrid ikun ra xi ħaġa.
It was there before.	Kien hemm qabel.
Little was seen of that.	Ftit li xejn deher minn dak.
But he had to do it, and glad too.	Imma kellu jagħmel dan, u ferħan ukoll.
So I did well today.	Hekk għamilt tajjeb illum.
This can be good and bad.	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb u ħażin.
It looked pretty good.	Huwa deher pjuttost tajjeb.
That was all.	Hekk kien biss.
I'm ready.	Jien lest.
I will have to go back to it.	Ikolli mmur lura għalih.
It was time.	Kien żmien.
I tell you this.	Jien ngħidlek dan.
That you are here to stay.	Li int hawn biex toqgħod.
It was always a bit, well.	Dejjem kien daqsxejn, tajjeb.
When the work was done, everyone went home.	Meta sar ix-xogħol, kulħadd mar id-dar.
Very easy actually.	Faċli ħafna fil-fatt.
I really wasn’t.	Verament ma kontx.
It will not help.	Mhux se jgħin.
But it wasn’t working.	Imma ma kienx qed jaħdem.
I could be alone on this one.	I jista 'jkun waħdi fuq dan wieħed.
It’s up to nothing good.	Hija sa xejn tajba.
But it wasn’t her.	Imma ma kinitx hi .
It was good for him to stay busy.	Kien tajjeb għalih li jibqa’ okkupat.
I try to talk to him, but it seems.	Nipprova nitkellem miegħu, imma jidher.
He did not know how and when.	Ma kienx jaf kif u meta.
But it wasn’t enough.	Imma ma kienx biżżejjed.
Other people do.	Nies oħra jagħmlu.
This is not great.	Dan mhuwiex kbir.
I don't have to tell you what happened.	M’għandix għalfejn ngħidlek x’ġara.
That’s a great thing for me.	Dik hija ħaġa kbira għalija.
He wasn’t really a man.	Ma kienx verament raġel.
I could be.	I jista 'jkun.
Maybe just, but not here.	Forsi biss, imma mhux hawn.
Or she.	Jew hi.
It was really hard.	Kien tassew diffiċli.
It wasn’t the same anymore.	Ma kinitx l-istess aktar.
That's how it's done.	Hekk isir.
No, not just anyone.	Le, mhux xi ħadd biss.
I can’t say for sure.	Ma nistax ngħid żgur.
That would be easy.	Dan ikun faċli.
He lives here.	Jgħix hawn.
But you must be tired.	Imma trid tkun għajjien.
He said no more.	Huwa qal mhux aktar.
I don’t know how far.	Ma nafx sa fejn.
But not good for me.	Imma mhux tajjeb għalija.
And he’s not the only one.	U hu mhux l-uniku wieħed.
When he’s worried, he’s usually right.	Meta jkun inkwetat, normalment ikollu raġun.
The le.	Le le.
No one needs these things.	Ħadd ma għandu bżonn dawn l-affarijiet.
I'm unemployed.	Jien bla xogħol.
He is leaving.	Qed jitlaq.
I have to wait around like everyone else.	Ikolli nistenna madwar bħal kulħadd.
He knew he was right.	Kien jaf li kellu raġun.
But it would take a while.	Imma kien jieħu ftit.
Surely you are right.	Żgur li għandek raġun.
He is not the only one who does such things.	Huwa mhux l-uniku wieħed li jagħmel affarijiet bħal dawn.
I would say so.	Jien ngħid hekk.
I have too.	Jien ukoll għandi.
That was about.	Dak kien madwar.
This was a time when nothing could help.	Din kienet darba fejn xejn ma għamel seta’ jgħin xi ħaġa.
We should know.	Għandna nkunu nafu.
But if it is not.	Imma jekk ma jkunx.
He was right.	Kellu raġun.
I want one, too.	Irrid wieħed, ukoll.
I know people there.	Naf nies hemmhekk.
Still years later.	Għadu snin wara.
He spoke very little.	Ftit li xejn kien jitkellem.
I really wonder what will happen next.	Verament nistaqsi x’se jiġri wara.
It could be tomorrow.	Jista 'jkun għada.
I can’t be happier.	Ma nistax inkun aktar kuntent.
She knew she had a problem.	Kienet taf li kellha problema.
The first is this.	L-ewwel huwa dan.
A long time ago, a few times.	Żmien twil ilu, ftit drabi.
It could be wrong.	Jista 'jkun ħażin.
In fact she never was.	Fil-fatt hi qatt ma kienet.
It was still.	Kien għadu.
It takes time.	Jeħtieġ iż-żmien.
But there was no one there, or rather, no one appeared.	Imma ma kien hemm ħadd hemm, jew aħjar, ħadd ma jidher.
And he didn't have to leave.	U ma kellux jitlaq.
I’ve done it so often, actually.	Jien għamilt hekk spiss, fil-fatt.
And I couldn’t believe it.	U ma setax nemmen.
I would be very happy.	Inkun kuntent ħafna.
Why so much? 	Għaliex tant?
You don't.	Inti ma.
No one knows where he is.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn hu.
And they are probably right.	U probabbilment għandhom raġun.
Now let’s get to that work.	Issa ejja nagħmlu dak ix-xogħol.
It does nothing.	Ma jagħmel xejn.
Not here, not now.	Mhux hawn, mhux issa.
I think that.	Naħseb li.
I don’t know why or how this happened.	Ma nafx għaliex jew kif ġara dan.
Just not enough.	Biss mhux biżżejjed.
There is something to this.	Hemm xi ħaġa għal dan.
To other people.	Lil nies oħra.
This will work.	Dan se jaħdem.
Have fun up there.	Tieħu gost hemm fuq.
It does nothing for nothing.	Ma jagħmel xejn għal xejn.
You said that wasn’t enough for you anymore.	Inti għedt li dan ma kienx biżżejjed għalik aktar.
But he saw none of this.	Imma ma ra xejn minn dan.
I had quite a few.	Kelli pjuttost ftit.
And so it will.	U hekk se.
And it can be.	U jista 'jkun.
I need to tell you something.	Għandi bżonn ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
But he never would.	Imma qatt ma kien se.
Not always, but usually.	Mhux dejjem, imma normalment.
And he never died.	U qatt ma miet.
I have known for years.	Ilni snin naf.
He really knows his stuff.	Huwa verament jaf l-affarijiet tiegħu.
This can be overwhelming.	Dan jista 'jkun kbir.
For hours and hours.	Għal sigħat u sigħat.
You are, aren't you?	Int int, hux?
Sure enough, there was another.	Żgur biżżejjed, kien hemm ieħor.
Probably too.	Probabbilment wisq.
He needed something more.	Huwa kellu bżonn xi ħaġa aktar.
We will do that.	Se nagħmlu hekk.
It could not be done.	Ma setax isir.
This is not the same.	Dan mhux l-istess.
I'm glad you came.	Jien ferħan li tista’ tiġi.
Time passed and passed.	Iż-żmien għadda u għadda.
I had never seen this before.	Qatt ma kont rajt dan qabel.
All you need to do is say.	Kull ma trid tagħmel hu li tgħid.
And not many people do that.	U mhux ħafna nies jagħmlu dan.
This is not me.	Dan mhux jien.
He was still young.	Kien għadu żgħir.
Which he is now.	Li hu issa.
Don't be.	Tkunx .
And it looks not so good.	U jidher mhux daqshekk tajjeb.
But he obviously didn’t.	Imma ovvjament ma kellux.
Well, he's back.	Ukoll, huwa lura.
But it’s never too late.	Imma qatt mhu tard wisq.
It’s easy and should be good.	Huwa faċli u għandu jkun tajjeb.
Tell me.	Qalli.
You also know that it can take a long time.	Taf ukoll li jista’ jieħu ħafna ħin.
She knew something was wrong.	Kienet taf li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
Just another time.	Darba oħra biss.
She will go, but he will not stay.	Hi se tmur, imma hu mhux se jibqa’.
I want to know how it all happens.	Irrid inkun naf kif jiġri dan kollu.
Do you have what it takes ?.	Għandek dak li hemm bżonn?.
She was right that she wants to know everything.	Kienet kellha raġun li trid tkun taf kollox.
But it could be.	Imma jista’ jkun.
But look around.	Imma ħares madwar.
Not even to those who know on the outside.	Lanqas lil min jaf fuq barra.
It’s a big job.	Huwa xogħol kbir.
And it's mine.	U huwa tiegħi.
The car only.	Il-karozza biss.
It was a lot of work.	Kien ħafna xogħol.
There is nothing for you out there.	M'hemm xejn għalik hemmhekk.
It was easy.	Kien faċli.
I can say so much.	Jien nista' ngħid daqshekk.
I have you.	għandi int.
There is something for every person.	Hemm xi ħaġa għal kull persuna.
And he did very well.	U dan għamel tajjeb ħafna.
I don't like to be scared.	Ma nħobbx nibża’.
You should know that.	Għandek tkun taf li.
He did a lot.	Għamel ħafna.
He was just tired.	Kien biss għajjien.
I had to wonder about that as well.	Kelli nistaqsi dwar dak ukoll.
He arrived home late.	Wasal id-dar tard.
But it only happened once before.	Imma ġara darba biss qabel.
It would be out.	Ikun barra.
Good not bad.	Tajjeb mhux ħażin.
I just want to leave.	Nixtieq biss li jitlaq.
I just wanted to say.	Ridt biss ngħid.
No there was no time.	Le ma kienx hemm ħin.
But no doing.	Imma l-ebda tagħmel.
I think a lot.	Naħseb ħafna.
There is such a thing as too late.	Hemm ħaġa bħal tard wisq.
That was someone else.	Dak kien xi ħadd ieħor.
But everything went wrong.	Imma kollox mar ħażin.
It wasn't.	Ma kienx.
I was the first one to see this.	Jien kont l-ewwel wieħed li rajt dan.
Well, we did.	Ukoll, għamilna dan.
And no one was happy.	U ħadd ma kien kuntent.
Was he your friend?	Kien ħabib tiegħek?
You can stay there tonight.	Tista' toqgħod hemm illejla.
To do this is quite easy.	Li tagħmel dan huwa pjuttost faċli.
But it wasn’t, really.	Imma ma kinitx, tassew.
I couldn’t do it anymore.	Ma stajtx nagħmel aktar.
She knew what you wanted.	Kienet taf xi trid.
Everything will never be the same.	Kollox qatt mhu se jkun l-istess.
She wants to help you.	Hi tixtieq tkun ta’ għajnuna għalik.
I just want one.	Irrid wieħed biss.
And of course, there are many more.	U ovvjament, hemm ħafna aktar.
He was not going to get any help.	Ma kienx se jkun qed jieħu l-ebda għajnuna.
It's a good fit.	Huwa tajjeb tajjeb.
Not just me, but everyone.	Mhux jien biss, imma kulħadd.
I will do that.	Jien se nagħmel dan.
This is a really, really bad idea.	Din hija idea tassew, tassew ħażina.
It could be that.	Jista 'jkun li.
I still have so many friends there.	Għadni tant ħbieb hemmhekk.
I’ll be happy to wait until it’s time to go.	Inkun kuntent nistenna sakemm wasal iż-żmien li mmur.
I’m too tired, and it takes too much of me.	Jien għajjien wisq, u tieħu wisq minni.
I don't know why.	Ma nafx għaliex.
I think it was really good.	Naħseb li kien tassew tajjeb.
Now he was back.	Issa kien lura.
He may have died.	Jista’ jkun miet.
It doesn’t seem too happy for me.	Ma jidhirx wisq ferħan għalija.
It did not appear.	Ma deherx.
He said and did nothing.	Qal u ma għamel xejn.
He thought not.	Huwa ħaseb li le.
That will come.	Dak se jiġi.
I can't do anything for you.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn għalik.
But he was still young.	Imma kien għadu żgħir.
In fact, it wasn't so good at the time.	Fil-fatt ma kienx daqshekk tajjeb dak iż-żmien.
If you don’t, you’re doing something wrong.	Jekk ma tagħmilx hekk, qed tagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina.
A few times, maybe.	Ftit drabi, forsi.
I knew there would be.	Kont naf li jkun hemm.
What he needs now is help.	Dak li jeħtieġ issa huwa l-għajnuna.
But he never was, he knew that now.	Imma qatt ma kien, kien jaf li issa.
It’s more than it does.	Huwa aktar minn min jagħmel.
I never went back to that.	Jien qatt ma mort lura għal dak.
You can do anything, there.	Inti tista 'tagħmel xi ħaġa, hemmhekk.
This is really so.	Dan huwa tassew hekk.
Nor do we.	Lanqas għandna.
No one knew where he went.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn mar.
No one knew what to do next.	L-ebda wieħed ma kien jaf x'għandu jagħmel wara.
It wasn’t me.	Ma kontx jien.
He was a boy.	Kien tifel.
This she may not do.	Dan hi tista 'ma tagħmilx.
This takes a long time to do.	Dan jieħu ħafna żmien biex isir.
I was sure it was something else.	Kont ċert li kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
He can't come home.	Ma jistax jiġi d-dar.
I couldn’t see who was driving.	Ma stajtx nara min kien qed isuq.
Sometimes, too.	Xi drabi, wisq.
I have never seen anything like it.	Qatt ma rajt xejn bħal dan.
He just wants to be sure.	Huwa biss irid ikun ċert.
This is not working properly.	Dan mhux kif suppost qed jaħdem.
No one seemed surprised.	Ħadd ma deher sorpriż.
A little more, please?	Ftit aktar, jekk jogħġbok?
I am almost three years old.	Għandi kważi tliet snin.
This will never happen.	Dan qatt mhu se jiġri.
She's not doing anything now.	Hija ma tagħmel xejn issa.
Sure,	Żgur,
It wouldn’t be.	Mhux ikun.
Or sorry for me.	Jew jiddispjaċini għalija.
There is such a thing.	Hemm ħaġa bħal din.
I’ll tell you later.	Jien ngħidlek aktar tard.
This is not going properly.	Dan mhux kif suppost sejjer.
That book was really surprising.	Dak il-ktieb kien tassew sorpriż.
Another bad idea.	Idea ħażina oħra.
It was one thing too.	Kienet ħaġa waħda wisq.
Or you don’t have to.	Jew m'għandekx għalfejn.
That’s just what she was doing.	Dak hu biss dak li kienet tagħmel.
That comes later.	Dak jiġi aktar tard.
It all started to happen.	Dan kollu beda jiġri.
It may take some time to do this.	Jista 'jieħu ftit żmien biex tagħmel dan.
Now, you know better than to do that.	Issa, taf aħjar milli tagħmel dan.
It was small.	Kien żgħir.
It won’t be long now.	Mhux se jkun twil issa.
It's just too much.	Huwa biss wisq.
I know there is more.	Naf li hemm aktar.
I know they are.	Naf li huma.
Once is not enough.	Darba mhix biżżejjed.
Everyone does that.	Kulħadd jagħmel hekk.
They will do something for you.	Huma se jagħmlu xi ħaġa għalik.
Or a car.	Jew karozza.
He is playing faster.	Huwa qed jilgħab aktar malajr.
He wanted to know where he was going.	Ried ikun jaf fejn jista’ jkun.
There was something wrong with it.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa li ma kinitx tajba dwarha.
fi.	fi.
It must before.	Għandu qabel.
But it was good.	Imma kien tajjeb.
There are many, many out there.	Hemm ħafna, ħafna hemmhekk.
Nobody told me about it.	Ħadd ma qalli dwarha.
I don’t think we can do anything about it.	Ma naħsibx li nistgħu nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwarha.
Probably nobody does.	Probabbilment ħadd ma jagħmel.
It's everything and more.	Huwa kollox u aktar.
Maybe he had just started.	Forsi kien għadu kemm beda.
Now he was sure.	Issa kien ċert.
It’s not easy, it’s really not.	Mhuwiex faċli, huwa verament mhux.
He couldn't think.	Ma setax jaħseb.
He is going home.	Huwa sejjer id-dar.
That was a good idea.	Dik kienet idea tajba.
I know it will.	Naf li se.
You know how great it is.	Taf kemm hu kbir.
That's supposed to be done.	Hekk suppost isir.
He seemed worried.	Deher inkwetat.
You have no money.	M'għandekx flus.
I don’t know why this is.	Ma nafx għaliex dan hu.
Whatever it takes.	Tkun xi tkun tieħu.
I go alone, which is good.	Immur waħdi, li huwa tajjeb.
But this was never going to happen.	Imma dan qatt ma kien se jiġri.
I think what will happen.	Naħseb x'se jiġri.
Maybe it came from someone else.	Forsi ġie minn xi ħadd ieħor.
It would be a good idea.	Tkun idea tajba.
So it was now.	Hekk kien issa.
She had to do, she had to.	Hija kellha tagħmel, kellha hi.
He is your friend.	Huwa ħabib tiegħek.
I really am.	Jien tassew.
He was alone, alone as many people as possible.	Kien waħdu, waħdu kemm jista’ jkun persuna.
He can't stay back there.	Ma jistax jibqa’ lura hemm.
You just do.	Inti biss tagħmel.
No, that's not what happened.	Le, mhux dak li ġara.
But he wasn't saying much.	Imma ma kienx qed jgħid ħafna.
It was time.	Kien wasal iż-żmien.
He may not know.	Jista’ ma jkunx jaf.
Today it was not.	Illum ma kienx.
Nothing more will do.	Xejn aktar se tagħmel.
I don't think this will ever happen again.	Ma naħsibx li dan qatt se jerġa’ jiġri.
I'm pretty easy.	Jien pjuttost faċli.
He hadn’t thought about it.	Ma kienx ħaseb dwarha.
That nothing is wrong.	Li xejn mhu ħażin.
I'm going back to school.	Jien sejjer lura l-iskola.
I'm having problems here.	Qed ikolli problemi hawn.
It's too late now.	Issa huwa tard.
Something can happen.	Jista' jiġri xi ħaġa.
That would be good.	Dan ikun tajjeb.
I think you know that.	Naħseb li taf li.
He knew so many people.	Kien jaf tant nies.
Time is money.	Iż-żmien huwa flus.
It was really good actually.	Kien tassew tajjeb fil-fatt.
He never asked for anything.	Qatt ma talab xejn.
You are both right.	Għandek raġun it-tnejn.
Nothing will do, really.	Xejn se tagħmel, verament.
There is no way around this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod madwar dan.
More than one.	Aktar minn wieħed.
He just wanted me.	Ried lili biss.
There is a lot of this right now.	Hemm ħafna minn dan bħalissa.
Sorry for that.	Jiddispjaċini għalih.
I was doing well.	Kont qed nagħmel tajjeb.
Until it happened to me.	Sakemm ġara lili.
He will do well.	Huwa se jagħmel tajjeb.
From here, you’re alone.	Minn hawn, int waħdek.
I want to know what he knows.	Irrid inkun naf dak li jaf.
But he knew it was more than that.	Imma kien jaf li kien aktar minn hekk.
He lives there now.	Jgħix hemm issa.
But only now I do not.	Imma biss issa jien ma.
But you have to go.	Imma trid tmur.
I didn’t know better.	Ma kontx taf aħjar.
That may have been before.	Dak seta’ kien qabel.
This is a good thing.	Din hija ħaġa tajba.
Or well, almost nothing.	Jew ukoll, kważi xejn.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwarha.
It would be good to be home.	Ikun tajjeb li tkun id-dar.
It will never be enough.	Qatt ma jkun biżżejjed.
It’s too early to tell.	Għadu kmieni wisq biex tgħid.
So good, so good.	Hekk tajjeb, hekk tajjeb.
We were done.	Konna għamilna.
Well, more than one.	Tajjeb, aktar minn wieħed.
Everything was wrong.	Kollox kien ħażin.
It takes a lot more than that.	Huwa jieħu ħafna aktar minn hekk.
From here you’re good to go.	Minn hawn int tajjeb li tmur.
This is not what we have here.	Dan mhuwiex dak li għandna hawn.
But it's worth a try.	Imma ta’ min jipprova.
It may or may not be.	Jista’ jkun, jista’ ma jkunx.
I don’t really know.	Ma nafx verament.
Maybe it would be great.	Forsi jkun kbir.
I want everything you have.	Irrid dak kollu li għandek.
It was too small.	Kien żgħir wisq.
She was alone now.	Hija kienet waħedha issa.
He was very happy.	Kien kuntent ħafna.
You better go.	Aħjar tmur.
Very, very often.	Ħafna, ħafna drabi.
That must be him.	Dak irid ikun hu.
I don't think he can.	Ma naħsibx li jista’.
She had a husband.	Kellu raġel tiegħu.
But he wanted to wait.	Imma ried jistenna.
Not very good.	Mhux tajjeb ħafna.
You know how it works.	Taf kif jaħdem.
I'm happy for you.	Jien kuntent għalik.
It was beautiful once.	Kienet sabiħa darba.
It is usually a very good time.	Normalment ikun żmien tajjeb ħafna.
Too few people do that.	Ftit wisq nies jagħmlu dan.
Maybe just a little.	Forsi ftit biss.
That will do.	Li se tagħmel.
I can do that now.	Jien nista' nagħmel dan issa.
And it was getting better to do.	U kien qed isir aħjar biex jagħmel dan.
She says no.	Hi tgħid le.
That was enough for that time.	Dan kien biżżejjed għal dak iż-żmien.
You will be fine.	Int se tkun tajjeb.
He didn't know what was going to happen.	Ma kienx jaf x’kien se jiġri.
You know where she is.	Taf fejn hi.
This is not what you have.	Dan mhux dak li għandek.
More and more and more.	Aktar u aktar u aktar.
I can do that.	I tista 'tagħmel dan.
I don’t know where I’m going from here.	Ma nafx fejn immur minn hawn.
I think she did.	Naħseb li għamlet.
I do what my job requires.	Nagħmel dak li jeħtieġ ix-xogħol tiegħi.
One of yours.	Wieħed minn tiegħek.
Nothing, and never.	Xejn, u qatt.
Plus, it’s beautiful.	Barra minn hekk, hija sabiħa.
But that’s about it.	Imma dak hu dwar dan.
But no, not so.	Imma le, mhux hekk.
Everyone will make way for you now.	Kulħadd se jagħmel mod għalik issa.
But there is a way.	Imma hemm mod.
This as it should be.	Dan kif għandu jkun.
One will survive.	Wieħed se jgħix.
I try to be a good person.	Nipprova nkun persuna tajba.
I don’t know why.	Ma nafx għalfejn.
Not so it was last year.	Mhux hekk kienet l-aħħar sena.
It was just having fun.	Kienet biss tieħu gost.
I will do something for you.	Nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik.
You know you’re glad.	Taf li int ferħan.
It must be better than it has ever been before.	Għandu jkun aħjar milli qatt kien qabel.
We will make everything work.	Aħna se nagħmlu kollox jaħdem.
But here you are.	Imma hawn int.
I understand that should be pretty good.	Nifhem li għandu jkun pjuttost tajjeb.
Much of this comes from.	Ħafna minn dan ġej minn.
I know he used to say that too	Naf li kien jgħid hekk ukoll
Not that it's a bad thing.	Mhux li hija ħaġa ħażina.
I heard it happen here	Smajt li jiġri hawn
He was never without a car.	Qatt ma kien bla karozza.
But it was very much so.	Imma kienet ħafna hekk.
How to do.	Kif jagħmlu.
I will have to talk to you	Ikolli nitkellem miegħek
I always knew where he was with him	Dejjem kont taf fejn qiegħed miegħu
Someone else said it was.	Xi ħadd ieħor qal li kien.
And he would know.	U kien ikun jaf.
He's just a big boy.	Huwa biss tifel kbir.
U se.	U se.
She was not going to do anything.	Ma kienet se tagħmel xejn.
I just couldn't understand	Jien biss ma stajtx nifhem
It would be really hard.	Ikun verament diffiċli ħafna.
I can't understand why	Ma nistax nifhem għaliex
I was scared.	Kont nibża’.
It was hard for me.	Kien diffiċli għalija.
I’m willing to do that	Jien lest li nagħmel dan
Well, no he didn't.	Ukoll, le hu ma.
Not yet.	Għadni ma tantx.
Maybe that’s not a bad thing, he thought.	Forsi dik mhix ħaġa ħażina, ħaseb.
I hope you see this wherever it is	Nittama li qed jara dan kull fejn ikun
It was very easy outside.	Barra kien faċli ħafna.
I would be alone.	Jien inkun waħdi.
I wanted to try not to think about anything	Ridt nipprova ma naħseb xejn
A little more time to do what he wants	Ftit aktar ħin biex jagħmel dak li jrid
I was more worried than anything	Kont inkwetat aktar minn kull ħaġa
It was pretty big.	Kien pjuttost kbira.
That’s just one thing.	Dik hija ħaġa waħda biss.
I know everything that happens here	Naf dak kollu li jiġri hawn
I need to know more.	Għandi bżonn inkun naf aktar.
I saw another man do the same thing later	Rajt raġel ieħor jagħmel l-istess ħaġa aktar tard
That’s who they are now, and not a big deal.	Dak hu li huma issa, u mhux ħaġa kbira.
That's all there is to it.	Huwa biss dak li hu.
I need to see something	Għandi bżonn nara xi ħaġa
We want to.	Irridu.
But you really want to come with us.	Imma int verament trid tiġi magħna.
You and I, we are the same.	Int u jien, aħna l-istess.
I know it wasn’t.	Naf li ma kienx.
That's what we are.	Huwa dak li aħna.
They are the same.	Huma l-istess.
This is pretty much it.	Dan huwa pjuttost ħafna.
It’s the same to speak of.	Huwa l-istess biex titkellem.
As he was.	Kif kien hu.
I thought it would be easy	Ħsibt li jkun faċli
Well, it’s harder for you.	Ukoll, huwa aktar diffiċli għalik.
I hope you know that	Nittama li inti taf li
I would.	Nixtieq.
But it’s never working.	Imma qatt mhu qed jaħdem.
Or not at all.	Jew lanqas hekk.
And the time has come.	U wasal iż-żmien.
I needed to understand this myself	Kelli bżonn nifhem dan jien
I thought too much	Ħsibt wisq
I never suspected anything	Qatt ma kont nissuspetta xejn
I didn’t know any better at the time	Dak iż-żmien ma kontx naf aħjar
He didn’t have much time to wait.	Ma kellux wisq żmien jistenna.
We know this and it should be.	Aħna nafu dan u għandu jkun.
I'm very sorry, not really	Jiddispjaċini ħafna, mhux verament
I'm still not sure.	Għadni mhux ċert.
We know who did it, too.	Aħna nafu min għamel dan, ukoll.
I know I didn’t want that	Naf li ma ridtx dan
I know this is unlikely to happen again	Naf li dan probabbilment mhux se jerġa’ jiġri
I didn’t want to know any more	Ma ridtx inkun naf aktar
I didn't want to see that	Ma ridtx nara dan
She is the only one.	Hija l-unika waħda.
I'll be here	Jien ser inkun hawn
I will definitely do it	Żgur li se nagħmel
I thought everyone was gone	Ħsibt li kulħadd kien mar
This is a good thing for me.	Din hija ħaġa tajba għalija.
I didn’t have to tell anyone	Ma kelli għalfejn ngħid lil ħadd
He had to know.	Huwa kellu jkun jaf.
I don't even think he knew about it.	Lanqas naħseb li kien jaf b’dan.
I would actually.	Nixtieq li fil-fatt.
I don't know who started it	Ma nafx min beda dan
Obviously, nothing came out.	Ovvjament, ma ħareġ xejn.
Maybe it helps.	Forsi jgħin.
I went back to the car	Mort lura lejn il-karozza
Maybe you heard about it.	Forsi smajt dwarha.
I don’t think she is.	Ma naħsibx li hi.
But good.	Imma tajjeb.
I only know where you are	Naf biss fejn int
And it should be so here.	U għandu jkun hekk hawn.
I'm pretty sure he can't	Jien kważi ċert li ma jistax
He's not talking yet.	Għadu ma titkellem.
This needs to happen.	Dan jeħtieġ li jiġri.
I never want to know	Qatt ma rrid inkun naf
I would like to see that finished.	Nixtieq nara dak lest.
I just didn’t have time, today to ask around	I biss ma kellix ħin, illum biex nistaqsi madwar
Just me.	Lili biss.
I knew she wasn’t going to be around forever	Kont naf li ma kinitx se tkun madwar għal dejjem
I just wish it hadn’t been for so long	Nixtieq biss li ma kienx għal daqshekk twil
But he doesn't want to stay.	Imma ma jridx jibqa’.
I think he was a man	Naħseb li kien raġel
I don’t like it now	Ma nħobbx issa
I have none.	M'għandi l-ebda.
There is something wrong.	Hemm xi ħaġa ħażina.
The same is happening today.	L-istess qed jiġri llum.
And almost no one knows who they are.	U kważi ħadd ma jaf min huma.
I wonder if now is the time to ask.	Nistaqsi jekk issa hux iż-żmien li nistaqsi.
They are no such thing.	Huma l-ebda ħaġa bħal din.
Mine doesn't have that.	Tiegħi m'għandux dak.
He did not know what to expect.	Ma kienx jaf x’se jistenna.
It couldn’t be that way.	Ma setax ikun hekk.
But nothing had gone well.	Imma xejn ma kien mar tajjeb.
That’s because it wasn’t there.	Dan għaliex ma kienx hemm.
I was a boy	Kont qed inkun tifel
You know how it looks.	Taf kif tidher.
Well, that happened.	Ukoll, dan ġara.
I went there today, but no one was home	Illum mort hemm, imma ħadd ma kien id-dar
No one needs to know.	Ħadd ma għandu bżonn ikun jaf.
I really needed help	Verament kelli bżonn l-għajnuna
But he did.	Imma hekk għamel.
And he is right.	U hu raġun.
She doesn’t want to do that, either.	Hija ma tridx tagħmel dan, lanqas.
I can't be alone with him	Ma nistax inkun waħdi miegħu
This is not a chance.	Dan mhux ċans.
I hadn’t really thought of anything	Jien ma kont verament ħsibt xejn
I know who you are, and that’s not talking	Naf min int, u dan mhux qed titkellem
It's still there.	Għadu hemm.
I was trying to be good	Kont qed nipprova nkun tajjeb
That was after.	Dak kien wara.
You know that now.	Inti taf dan issa.
This makes things a lot easier.	Dan jagħmel l-affarijiet ħafna aktar faċli.
I can't wait until tomorrow	Ma nistax nistenna sa għada
I'm afraid of all this.	Jien nibża’ minn dan kollu.
Everyone is happy again.	Kulħadd jerġa’ ferħan.
I was just small, but it was easy	Kont żgħir biss, imma kien faċli
I hope you will.	Nispera li tiġi.
I can't see.	Ma nistax nara.
He said he was.	Qal li kien.
There is nothing to see there.	M'hemm xejn x'tara hemmhekk.
I don't understand anything about it	Ma nifhem xejn dwarha
You know things.	Taf affarijiet.
As she says.	Kif tgħid hi.
I thought back to what he said	Ħsibt lura għal dak li qal
I didn’t like talking about it.	Ma kontx inħobb nitkellem dwarha.
I can see that happening	Nista' nara li jiġri
And that can't be right.	U dan ma jistax ikun tajjeb.
The morning was not the same.	Filgħodu ma kienx l-istess.
It was very big for me.	Kien kbir ħafna għalija.
And besides, she is not.	U barra minn hekk, hi mhix .
We want to be fast now.	Irridu nkunu malajr issa.
I never know what to do next	Qatt ma naf x’se tagħmel wara
Definitely would.	Żgur li kieku.
I don’t want more than you should.	Ma rridx aktar milli suppost.
She plans to go to school.	Jippjana li tmur l-iskola.
I'm doing what he wants	Qed nagħmel li jrid hu
I hope there is someone out there	Nittama li hemm xi ħadd hemmhekk
It started again.	Beda mill-ġdid.
We have everything here.	Għandna kollox hawn.
I’ve done this before, at home.	Jien għamilt dan qabel, id-dar.
So it seems.	Hekk jidher.
But we had each other.	Imma kellna lil xulxin.
I would be ready.	Inkun lest.
And sitting down.	U bilqiegħda.
I may not know it today	Jien forsi ma nafx illum
Nor was he the only one worried.	Lanqas ma kien l-uniku inkwetat.
A few hours at a time.	Ftit sigħat kull darba.
So he said.	Hekk qal.
I think so too.	Naħseb hekk ukoll.
I never knew it was there.	Qatt ma kont taf li kien hemm.
If you do, there is the door.	Jekk tagħmel hekk, hemm il-bieb.
I needed to do something	Kelli bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa
I shouldn't talk about it.	M'għandix nitkellem dwarha.
I’m not so sure now.	M'inix daqshekk ċert issa.
We were too late.	Konna tard wisq.
I hope you are not home now	Nispera li ma tkunx id-dar issa
Not so bad.	Mhuwiex daqshekk ħażin.
And if.	U kieku.
I want to think too much about it	Irrid naħseb wisq dwar dan
Something good will happen.	Se jiġri xi ħaġa tajba.
Maybe they were, a little.	Forsi kienu, ftit.
That couldn’t be.	Dak ma setax ikun.
As you know.	Kif taf.
The problem was not there.	Il-problema ma kinitx hemm.
I couldn't think about it again	Ma stajtx nerġa' naħseb dwar dan
But no one comes for me.	Imma ħadd ma jiġi għalija.
I can't even tell how far I'm going	Lanqas nista’ ngħid kemm sejjer
He said.	Qal.
It's pretty, isn't it? 	Huwa pjuttost, hux?
she says.	hi tgħid.
I’m not too worried about it	Jien mhux wisq inkwetat dwarha
You were glad.	Int kont ferħan.
I can't say anything	Ma nista’ ngħid xejn
That's right, one at a time.	Hekk hu, wieħed kull darba.
It's there.	Huwa hemmhekk.
He was not alone.	Hu ma kienx waħdu.
Maybe he saw something he shouldn’t have.	Forsi ra xi ħaġa li ma kellux ikollu.
I can't say anything.	Ma nista’ ngħid xejn.
That's a good thing.	Dik ħaġa tajba.
A friend would never do as you did	Ħabib qatt ma kien jagħmel kif għamilt int
Not great, but good.	Mhux kbir, imma tajjeb.
You can't be sure.	Ma tistax tkun ċert.
But someone has to do it.	Imma xi ħadd irid jagħmel dan.
Not beautiful.	Mhix sabiħa.
I'm good at this.	Jien tajjeb b'dan.
There was a lot here, and he would soon have more.	Kien hemm ħafna hawn, u dalwaqt kien ikollu aktar.
I knew he was right too	Kont naf li kellu raġun ukoll
It makes everything look great.	Jagħmel kollox jidher tajjeb ħafna.
She was right.	Kellha raġun.
I had had enough of this.	Kelli biżżejjed minn dan.
I didn’t have to go	Ma kellix immur
I was so out of here.	Kont tant barra minn hawn.
I doubt it, but maybe	Niddubita, imma forsi
Well, he said nothing.	Tajjeb, ma qal xejn.
This I will do no more.	Dan mhux se nagħmel aktar.
It looks good to me.	Jidher tajjeb għalija.
He knew who he was.	Kien jaf min kien.
But she says nothing.	Imma hi ma tgħid xejn.
I knew he didn't have a chance at home	Kont naf li ma kienx kellu ċans id-dar
I say everything.	Jien ngħid kollox.
He wanted nothing.	Ried xejn.
There was nothing I could do.	Ma kien hemm xejn li stajt tagħmel.
The problem is, they do.	Il-problema hija, huma jagħmlu.
I think it was on to something	Naħseb li kien fuq xi ħaġa
I wasn't sure if I was here before	Ma kontx ċert jekk kontx hawn qabel
I thought about home	Ħsibt dwar id-dar
It was very easy. 	Kienet faċli ħafna. 
I know what you are planning	Naf x'qed tippjana
It could be for you too.	Jista’ jkun għalik ukoll.
I look forward to talking to you tomorrow	Nistenna li nitkellem miegħek għada
I just have to be me	Għandi biss inkun jien
It won't be my first time.	Mhux se tkun l-ewwel darba tiegħi.
Everyone was scared.	Kulħadd kien qed jibża’.
She knows we did.	Hija taf li għamilna.
Be it good or bad.	Tkun tajba jew ħażina.
I was the only person there	Jien kont l-unika persuna hemmhekk
It should be about that.	Għandu jkun dwar dan.
I can't say more than that	Ma nista’ ngħid xejn aktar minn hekk
No one has a hard time.	Ħadd ma għandu żmien diffiċli.
I'm glad you're here!	Jien kuntent li qiegħed hawn!
I’ve been there before and I did	Kont hemm qabel u għamilt hekk
I can't take it anymore	Ma nistax nieħu aktar
Or if not.	Jew kieku.
We can't do that.	Ma nistgħux nagħmlu hekk.
I think he’s having fun playing with us	Naħseb li qed jieħu gost jilgħab magħna
For a long time, he said nothing.	Għal żmien twil, ma qal xejn.
I believe you are on to something here	Nemmen li inti qiegħed fuq xi ħaġa hawn
No, not really, he said.	Le, mhux tassew, qal.
I needed to do something.	Kelli bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa.
It's good now.	Hija tajba issa.
She must be doing this forever.	Hija trid tkun qed tagħmel dan għal dejjem.
I know you are very busy	Naf li inti okkupat ħafna
I'm here with you now	Jien hawn, miegħek issa
Here and now.	Hawn u issa.
No one knew where he was.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn kien.
I have to tell you so	Jien għandi ngħidlek hekk
And you have to do the same.	U għandek tagħmel l-istess.
I just need to know what it is	Għandi biss inkun naf x'inhu
The car was not so bad.	Il-karozza ma kinitx daqshekk ħażina.
We have these.	Għandna dawn.
All this.	Dan kollu.
Well, it happens again.	Ukoll, jerġa 'jiġri.
I think they are a good thing	Naħseb li huma ħaġa tajba
These are right here.	Dawn huma eżatt hawn.
You know what will happen if you don't.	Taf x’se jiġri jekk ma tagħmilx hekk.
And that wasn’t good enough.	U dan ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed.
It’s nothing really.	Mhu xejn verament.
I knew it was wrong.	Kont naf li kien ħażin.
They do nothing.	Ma jagħmlu xejn.
Which is something he would do.	Li hija ħaġa li kien jagħmel.
Maybe not friends.	Forsi mhux ħbieb.
Or it would have been.	Jew kienet tkun.
I did what I could.	Għamilt li stajt.
It's not really worth working on.	Mhuwiex verament ta 'min jieħu xogħol fuq.
Everything works for me here.	Kollox jaħdem għalija hawn.
I was going.	Kont sejjer.
I knew it had to be	Kont naf li kellu jkun
Not very good after that.	Mhux tajjeb ħafna wara dak.
Really told me something.	Verament qalli xi ħaġa.
How are you.	Kif int.
I am better there.	Jiena aħjar hemmhekk.
I'm you.	Jien int.
I just saw it happen	Għadni kif rajt jiġri
I saw something there	Rajt xi ħaġa hemmhekk
I haven’t had one in almost three years	Ilni ma kellix waħda għal kważi tliet snin
It could be more.	Jista 'jkun aktar.
I'm just going.	Jien ser biss.
I will say this.	Jien se ngħid dan.
I wanted to be someone else	Ridt li jkun xi ħadd ieħor
I know exactly where she is.	Naf eżatt fejn hi.
Not for long, but.	Mhux għal żmien twil, imma.
I want to do all this with you	Irrid nagħmel dan kollu miegħek
He already knew everything.	Diġà kien jaf kollox.
How would a boy like that.	Kif ikun tifel bħal dan.
Above all and nothing.	Fuq kollox u xejn.
A few things, actually	Ftit affarijiet, fil-fatt
I know it wasn’t.	Naf li ma kinitx.
I need to know how bad it is	Għandi bżonn inkun naf kemm hu ħażin
And that’s what we did.	U dan huwa dak li għamilna.
And for people to do.	U għal nies li jagħmlu.
Like never before.	Bħal qatt qatt.
But definitely wrong.	Imma żgur ħażin.
It wasn’t enough.	Ma kienx biżżejjed.
I know it won't help	Naf li mhux se jgħin
Like home.	Bħal id-dar.
And it was so now.	U kien hekk issa.
I couldn’t take that	Ma stajtx nieħu dak
It just has to work.	Irid jaħdem biss.
I have no idea what it is	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'inhu
Everything should be fine.	Kollox għandu jkun tajjeb.
It was good to be there again.	Kien tajjeb li jerġa’ jkun hemm.
I was glad you came back	Kont kuntent li ġejt lura
I’ve done this many times	Jien kont għamilt dan ħafna drabi
I knew he was scared	Kont naf li kien jibża
I was a good man.	Jien kont raġel tajjeb.
I wasn't ready to talk	Ma kontx lest nitkellem
He just loved that.	Huwa biss iħobb dak.
We did this to get things done faster.	Għamilna dan biex nagħmlu l-affarijiet aktar malajr.
I understand how great this is	Nifhem kemm hu kbir dan
I heard about what happened today	Smajt dwar dak li ġara llum
Years later it happened.	Snin wara li ġara.
I didn’t want to go back	Ma ridtx immur lura
And he seems to be doing a good job.	U jidher li qed tagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
I needed to talk to you	Kelli bżonn nitkellem miegħek
I wasn’t ready to talk about it	Ma kontx lest nitkellem dwarha
I will be in the back.	Jien se nkun fuq wara.
I really thought he was dead.	Verament ħsibt li miet.
I hope you know that	Nispera li taf li
I like to be scared.	Inħobb nibża’.
When the time comes, he leaves.	Meta jasal iż-żmien, jitlaq.
And you can do that for hours.	U tista 'tagħmel dan għal sigħat.
Maybe more than you should.	Forsi aktar milli suppost.
I didn’t even have to ask.	Lanqas kelli għalfejn nistaqsi.
I was expecting something to happen	Kont qed nistenna li jiġri xi ħaġa
We have a husband.	Għandna raġel.
I had nothing to say	Ma kellix xi ngħid
I want to do something about it.	Irrid nagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
She was not here.	Hija ma kinitx hawn.
But she knew nothing.	Imma ma kienet taf xejn.
He would never do that.	Hu qatt ma kien jagħmel dan.
I can't see.	Ma nistax nara.
I know how hard it is for you	Naf kemm hi diffiċli għalik
Or your time, today.	Jew il-ħin tiegħek, illum.
Another car and it would have been there.	Karozza oħra u kien ikun hemm.
I had nowhere to go	Ma kelli fejn immur
This is not easy.	Dan mhux faċli.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
Our time has come.	Wasal iż-żmien tagħna.
I don’t know how he did that.	Ma nafx kif għamel dan.
What I did.	Dak li għamilt.
I didn’t have time to tell you	Ma kellix ħin ngħidlek
He has to.	Huwa għandu.
They were the wrong size.	Huma kienu ta 'daqs ħażin.
I can do so much better.	Nista' nagħmel ħafna aħjar.
What will happen ?.	X'se jiġri?.
I just wanted to know that this is happening	Ridt biss li tkun taf li dan qed jiġri
But no one knows for sure.	Imma ħadd ma jaf żgur.
I have to try.	Ikolli nipprova.
He was not working.	Hu ma kienx qed jaħdem.
It wasn't yours.	Ma kienx tiegħek.
Please don't do that.	Jekk jogħġbok tagħmilx hekk.
I wanted to know what was wrong with me	Ridt inkun naf x’kien ħażin miegħi
I was sitting there trying to think	Kont bilqiegħda hemm nipprova naħseb
I thought I was right about that	Ħsibt li kien tajjeb b'dan
I also didn’t want to tell anyone about it.	Jien ukoll ma ridt ngħid lil ħadd dwarha.
Someone was there.	Xi ħadd kien qiegħed hemm.
Maybe just having someone stay with us is enough.	Forsi biss li xi ħadd joqgħod magħna huwa biżżejjed.
I think it would be helpful.	Naħseb li jkun ta' għajnuna.
He wasn't sure what to do next.	Ma kienx ċert x’se jagħmel wara.
There was no time now.	Ma kienx hemm ħin issa.
I didn’t.	Jien ma kontx.
There was something else.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
Tired lately	Għajjien dan l-aħħar
It's really very good.	Huwa tassew tajjeb ħafna.
But not tonight, no, not tonight.	Imma mhux illejla, le, mhux illejla.
I would love to know	Nixtieq ħafna inkun naf
What he wanted he could not have.	Dak li ried ma setax ikollu.
I haven't had much help yet	Għadni ma kontx ta’ ħafna għajnuna
This is great, so glad you're here.	Dan huwa kbir, tant ferħan li int hawn.
I know everything that happens around here	Naf dak kollu li jiġri madwar hawn
I'm not going.	Mhux sejjer.
It was hard.	Kien diffiċli.
I know I was there last night	Naf li kont hemm ilbieraħ filgħaxija
Well now, here you are.	Ukoll issa, hawn int.
I was thinking too much	Kont qed naħseb wisq
Everyone knows.	Kulħadd ikun jaf.
There is nothing wrong with a little help.	M'hemm xejn ħażin bi ftit għajnuna.
He should know better.	Għandu jkun jaf aħjar.
I just want you to be happy	Irrid biss li tkun ferħan
I think you are right	Naħseb li għandek raġun
And put it there.	U poġġa hemm.
I still haven't been able to do that	Għadni ma stajtx nagħmel dan
But everything went well.	Imma kollox mar tajjeb.
I don’t know if it is.	Ma nafx jekk hux.
Not just about tonight.	Mhux biss dwar illejla.
I am the first.	Jiena l-ewwel.
I want you to think about it	Irrid li taħseb dwar dan
I know you are, of course you are	Naf li int, ovvjament int
How about no.	Kif dwar le.
He does many other things.	Jagħmel ħafna affarijiet oħra.
And so it was.	U hekk kienet.
It was good and bad.	Kien tajjeb u ħażin.
And it happened.	U ġara.
That's probably not much.	Li probabbilment mhux ħafna.
This doesn’t seem too hard to understand.	Dan ma jidhirx wisq diffiċli biex nifhem.
It will happen.	Se jiġri.
There is no way he is living that way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li qed jgħix minn hekk.
I think he was scared of me.	Naħseb li kien jibża minni.
I couldn’t do it for him	Ma stajtx nagħmel għalih
I would like to see something very soon	Nixtieq nara xi ħaġa malajr ħafna
It's been a long time coming.	Ilu żmien twil ġej.
I didn't expect that	Ma kontx nistenna dan
I'm so worried.	Jien tant inkwetat.
It happened too fast.	Ġara malajr wisq.
I don’t like that.	Jien ma nħobbx hekk.
I had nothing	Jien ma kelli xejn
No, later on.	Le, aktar tard minn hekk.
And now it’s too late.	U issa huwa tard wisq.
I needed to talk about it	Kelli bżonn nitkellem dwarha
Now he had to.	Issa kellu.
I can't understand what's going on anymore	Ma nistax nifhem aktar x'qed jiġri
I thought she was seeing someone else.	Ħsibt li kienet qed tara lil xi ħadd ieħor.
I couldn’t understand it that way.	Ma stajtx nifhem hekk.
Neither are you, not so.	Lanqas int, mhux hekk.
I didn't want to see that	Ma ridtx nara dan
I think they are right	Naħseb li għandhom raġun
I just wanted to see how it was going	Ridt biss nara kif kont sejjer
Whatever you want.	Tkun xi tkun trid.
Something else did.	Xi ħaġa oħra għamlet.
I didn’t even know for sure there was.	Lanqas kont naf ċert li kien hemm.
And you want and hope for something more.	U trid u nittama għal xi ħaġa aktar.
I did it.	Għamilt dan.
It is now.	Hija issa.
You know what will happen.	Int taf x'se jiġri.
I needed to say something	Kelli bżonn ngħid xi ħaġa
She never knew.	Qatt ma kienet tkun taf.
I haven’t told anyone yet.	Għadu ma għedt lil ħadd.
A little time to think about it helps	Ftit ħin biex taħseb dwarha jgħin
I didn’t see anything wrong.	Jien ma rajt xejn ħażin.
Well, a lot of things.	Ukoll, ħafna affarijiet.
I know someone who can help	Naf lil xi ħadd li jista’ jgħin
I never thought about it	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha
I will say nothing.	Se ngħid xejn.
I didn’t have to think	Ma kellix għalfejn naħseb
I want more than anything to be wrong	Irrid aktar minn kull ħaġa li tkun ħażina
I couldn’t do anything.	Ma stajt nagħmel xejn.
Not until you tell me what's going on.	Mhux sakemm tgħidli x’inhu jiġri.
It may be on something, it may not be.	Jista 'jkun fuq xi ħaġa, jista' ma jkunx.
I can say that he was afraid	Nista’ ngħid li kien jibża’
We really are.	Aħna tassew.
And you're going to do it tonight.	U int ser tagħmel dan illejla.
But he already knew who was there.	Imma hu diġà kien jaf min kien hemm.
Definitely you should.	Żgur li għandek.
It wasn’t fast enough.	Ma kienx malajr biżżejjed.
They are so.	Huma hekk.
You are either you, or you are not.	Int jew int, jew m'intix.
She was doing something.	Kienet tagħmel xi ħaġa.
Too much of this.	Wisq minn dan.
There’s a little bit of that, sure.	Hemm xi ftit minn dan, żgur.
Everyone is doing it.	Kulħadd qed jagħmel dan.
He did really well.	Huwa għamel tassew tajjeb.
I had very good help	Kelli għajnuna tajba ħafna
Too early.	Wisq kmieni.
He is a very young man.	Huwa raġel żgħir ħafna.
I hadn’t thought about it before	Ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan qabel
She never was.	Hija qatt ma kienet.
Everything was going well.	Kollox kien sejjer tajjeb.
I probably didn't have to tell you that	Probabbilment ma kellix għalfejn ngħidlek hekk
We will not return.	Aħna mhux se lura.
Maybe you should too.	Forsi għandek ukoll.
I love my job.	Inħobb ix-xogħol tiegħi.
I have no problem with that, good for you	M'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan, tajjeb għalik
And he actually has a year.	U fil-fatt għandu sena.
Just like eating well.	Eżatt bħal tiekol tajjeb.
I wasn’t sure where this was going	Ma kontx ċert fejn dan kien sejjer
He had seen enough.	Huwa kien ra biżżejjed.
I can't tell you anything more	Ma nistax ngħidlek xejn aktar
He did so well.	Huwa għamel hekk tajjeb.
That's not what you want.	Dak mhux dak li trid.
Until now I never thought	Sa issa qatt ma ħsibt
It seems you are almost there.	Jidher li inti kważi hemm.
I would be surprised.	Inkun sorpriż.
It was me.	Kien minni.
Nothing, nothing.	Xejn, xejn.
This is not much.	Dan mhux ħafna.
One.	Waħda.
I wasn’t sure what was going to happen	Jien ma kont xejn ċert x'se jiġri
Or, they should.	Jew, għandhom.
I couldn't eat right now	Ma stajtx niekol bħalissa
I knew the truth.	Kont naf il-verità.
I was there for about a year	Kont hemm għal madwar sena
I wanted to see what would happen	Ridt nara x’se jiġri
It was really bad for me.	Kien tassew ħażin ħafna għalija.
Well, it was great for one person.	Ukoll, kien ħafna għal persuna waħda.
Quite something for everyone	Pjuttost xi ħaġa għal kulħadd
He really thinks so.	Huwa verament jaħseb hekk.
I wonder what he will do now	Nistaqsi x’se jagħmel issa
I wish this had never happened	Nixtieq li dan qatt ma ġara
We do this all the time.	Aħna nagħmlu dan il-ħin kollu.
She is not.	Hija mhix.
I just wanted to do a good job.	Ridt biss nagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
He did the same thing.	Huwa għamel l-istess ħaġa.
Here it is.	Hawn hu.
Obviously it wasn’t working.	Ovvjament ma kienx qed jaħdem.
It just seemed that way.	Hekk deher biss.
He never knew who you were.	Hu qatt ma kien jaf min int tidher.
I don’t think anyone knew he was there	Ma naħsibx li ħadd ma kien jaf li kien hemm
You are a good man.	Inti raġel tajjeb.
I have to go back now	Ikolli mmur lura issa
I thought not.	Ħsibt li le.
I saw it happen	Rajt li jiġri
By now he knew how to do it.	Sa issa kien jaf kif jagħmel dan.
I never see.	Jien qatt ma nara.
I can't see what it is	Ma nistax nara x'inhu
But there really is another way.	Imma verament hemm mod ieħor.
Like, you can't even talk about it.	Bħal, lanqas tista’ titkellem dwarha.
There was only one problem.	Kien hemm problema waħda biss.
He could not speak.	Ma setax jitkellem.
I will do as you say	Jien se nagħmel kif tgħid
He loved to play.	Kien iħobb jilgħab.
I was no longer interested	Ma kontx aktar interessat
I need you to do this for me, now	Għandi bżonn li tagħmel dan għalija, issa
Nobody knew what was going on.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x’kien qed jiġri.
This works as it should.	Dan jaħdem kif għandu jkun.
I was no more	Ma kontx aktar
I believe she knew something	Nemmen li kienet taf xi ħaġa
It will never be the same.	Hija qatt mhu se tkun l-istess.
Nothing back.	Xejn lura.
I was there.	Jien kont hemm.
I want what’s on	Irrid dak li hi fuq
It’s not what it seems.	Mhuwiex dak li jidher.
But there is no chance.	Imma m'hemm l-ebda ċans.
And you know of course it was.	U taf ovvjament li kien verament.
I need you to stay with me.	Għandi bżonn li toqgħod miegħi.
I didn’t even know it was there	Lanqas kont naf li kien hemm
I just wanted to.	Ridt biss.
That will take forever.	Dak se jieħu għal dejjem.
She never thought about it.	Hija qatt ma ħsibt dwarha.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
I can’t take anything like that	Ma nistax nieħu xi ħaġa bħal dik
I needed to talk to him	Kelli bżonn nitkellem miegħu
I didn’t even have time to think about anything	Lanqas ma kelli ħin naħseb fuq xejn
He couldn't do it again.	Ma setax jagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
But maybe it was something else.	Imma forsi kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
The work was great.	Ix-xogħol kien kbir.
I was the same.	Jien kont l-istess.
It may be too late	Jista’ jkun lura tard ħafna
It will not help.	Mhux se jgħin.
They are just.	Huma biss.
I have none of mine, you see	Jien m'għandi xejn minn tiegħi, tara
But you know, maybe there's something there too.	Imma taf, forsi hemm xi ħaġa hemm ukoll.
He is ready to play.	Huwa ġie lest biex jilgħab.
He did so.	Hekk għamel.
Really good.	Tassew tajjeb.
It was home.	Kien id-dar.
And so it seems we have.	U hekk jidher li għandna aħna.
He stands for.	Huwa joqgħod għal.
Good and so on.	Tajjeb u hekk.
How do you do.	Kif tagħmel int.
I can't even talk to anyone.	Lanqas nista’ nitkellem ma’ ħadd.
I'm dead.	Jien mort.
I wasn't sure where	Ma kontx ċert minn fejn
I'll tell you who might be here	Jien ngħid min jista’ jkun hawn
I went too far to believe this.	Jien mort wisq biex nemmen dan.
I’m not sure what I will do.	M'inix ċert x'se nagħmel.
He died a few years later.	Miet ftit snin wara.
And I need to.	U għandi bżonn.
He is playing well.	Huwa qed jilgħab tajjeb.
I'm glad you're here.	Jien kuntent li qiegħed hawn.
I really like that	Nixtieq tassew hekk
It was some time.	Kien xi żmien.
I couldn't do it anymore	Ma stajtx nagħmel aktar
I had done the same.	Kelli għamel l-istess.
In fact, you can.	Fil-fatt, tista '.
If he is still here.	Jekk għadu hawn.
It never will be and never has been.	Qatt mhu se jkun u qatt ma kien.
Just take a good time.	Biss tieħu ħin tajjeb.
I’ve been thinking about it for a while	Ilni naħseb għal xi żmien
I was on top of everything	Kont fuq kollox
But he is still with us.	Imma hu għadu magħna.
I didn’t want to, not yet	Ma ridtx, għadha mhux
She will, if she can.	Hija se, jekk hi tista '.
All this was before he left.	Dan kollu kien qabel telaq.
I’m not doing anything wrong.	Jien ma nagħmel l-ebda ħaġa ħażina.
There was a problem.	Kien hemm problema.
Not surprised to do something like this.	Mhux sorpriż li jagħmlu xi ħaġa bħal din.
That was easy enough.	Dan kien faċli biżżejjed.
I need a lot of help.	Ikolli bżonn ħafna għajnuna.
It happened before that.	Ġara qabel dan.
I didn't have time to go back	Ma kellix ħin biex nerġa’ nerġa
But it was too late for that now.	Imma kien tard wisq għal dak issa.
This is a great idea.	Din hija idea kbira.
I’m not sure if you’re interested.	M'inix ċert jekk tkunx interessat.
Now you are alone.	Issa int waħdek.
I didn't know what was going on	Ma tantx kont naf x’kien qed jiġri
I hope they were all right	Jien nittama li kienu kollha tajjeb
We have you now.	Għandna inti issa.
I knew this and would never have said otherwise	Dan kont naf u qatt ma kien jgħid mod ieħor
I know you want some	Naf li trid xi ftit
I will never be the same	Jien qatt mhu se nkun l-istess
I had no idea what was going on	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'inhu jiġri
And not to the door.	U mhux lejn il-bieb.
And there are things we can do.	U hemm affarijiet li nistgħu nagħmlu.
When it’s good, it’s good.	Meta jkun tajjeb, hu tajjeb.
I think there is more than one.	Naħseb li hemm aktar minn wieħed.
I never thought about it	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha
This is my home.	Din id-dar tiegħi.
I couldn’t do anything about it	Ma stajt nagħmel xejn dwarha
He did a good job.	Huwa għamel xogħol tajjeb.
I was not in the room.	Jien ma kontx fil-kamra.
Anyone who knew him was not saying that.	Kull min seta’ kien jaf ma kienx qed jgħid.
He is not a man.	Mhuwiex raġel.
It may not be.	Jista 'ma jkunx.
I wish he was here with me	Nixtieq li kien hawn miegħi
I only have who I was	Għandi biss min kont
I didn’t stand a chance.	Ma kellix ċans.
I really wanted to go	Verament ridt immur
I had no idea where I was	Ma kellix idea fejn kont
Not so much.	Mhux daqshekk.
Really, it was.	Tassew, kienet.
If you want.	Jekk trid.
Well, with you this afternoon.	Tajjeb, miegħek illum wara nofsinhar.
I didn’t think so	Jien ma kontx ħsibt hekk
Really, the problem is what came next.	Tassew, il-problema hija dak li ġie wara.
I have to ask.	Għandi nistaqsi.
You saw that.	Inti rajt li.
I see you're busy	Nara li int okkupat
I think you like it	Naħseb li tixtieq
This can be too fast.	Dan jista 'jkun malajr wisq.
I was hardly at home.	Ma tantx kont inkun id-dar.
Just tell when and where.	Għid biss meta u fejn.
I wish he could see that	Nixtieq li jista’ jara dan
Many other people	Ħafna nies oħra
I couldn’t do it anymore.	Ma stajtx nagħmel aktar.
Not even.	Lanqas ma.
It’s not what you think.	Mhuwiex dak li taħseb.
This was done without any problems	Dan sar mingħajr problemi
By then it was too late.	Sa dak iż-żmien kien tard wisq.
I wanted to try something else	Ridt nipprova nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra
That would be.	Li tkun.
He loved being there.	Kien iħobb ikun hemm.
Maybe no one.	Forsi ħadd.
He had left again.	Huwa kien telaq mill-ġdid.
That was not what he needed.	Dan ma kienx dak li kellu bżonn.
I want everything to be so easy	Nixtieq li kollox ikun daqshekk faċli
A few years later he really had one	Ftit snin wara huwa verament kellu wieħed
I'm not entirely sure	M'inix ċert għal kollox
We know nothing.	Aħna ma nafu xejn.
I have a big problem with this	Għandi problema kbira b'dan
Too fast to do anything.	Malajr wisq biex tagħmel xi ħaġa.
And sometimes he was really busy.	U xi drabi kien tassew okkupat.
This is not the case.	Dan mhux hekk.
He could play forever.	Seta’ jilgħab għal dejjem.
I was still doing well.	Kont għadni sejjer tajjeb.
I believe they do	Nemmen li jagħmlu hekk
It’s always about that.	Huwa dejjem dwar dan.
She did things.	Hi għamlet l-affarijiet.
He was and still is my friend.	Kien u għadu ħabib tiegħi.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Imma mhix xi ħaġa ħażina.
We need more than that	Għandna bżonn aktar minn dan
But no one does that.	Imma m'hemm ħadd li jagħmel dan.
I really wasn't.	Verament ma kontx.
I truly believe that.	Jien tassew nemmen li.
I made sure of that	Jien għamilt ċert minn hekk
I wasn't even sure if he was coming home	Lanqas kont ċert li jerġa’ jiġi d-dar
He came home with me.	Wasal id-dar miegħi.
I don't, of course	Jien ma, ovvjament
It was both together, or nothing.	Kien it-tnejn flimkien, jew xejn.
This is it.	Dan hu.
I didn't want to see what happened next	Ma ridtx nara x’ġara wara
It could be anyone.	Jista’ jkun xi ħadd.
It wasn’t like that now.	Ma kienx hekk issa.
A man to think about	Raġel li wieħed għandu jaħseb miegħu
He knew where.	Kien jaf fejn.
I don’t know how long it will take.	Ma nafx kemm se tieħu.
I was just wondering about something	Kont biss nistaqsi dwar xi ħaġa
It's hard to do.	Huwa diffiċli li tagħmel.
It's so long.	Huwa daqshekk twil.
There was no one else around.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor madwar.
I already know all this	Diġà naf dan kollu
She says she's going back home.	Tgħid li tmur lura d-dar.
I wasn’t worried	Ma kellix inkwetat
This we have in my house.	Dan għandna d-dar tiegħi.
I thought it was time to come home	Ħsibt li wasal iż-żmien li tiġi d-dar
Obviously not.	Ovvjament mhux.
Everything went well.	Kollox mar tajjeb.
I think it was very difficult for him.	Naħseb li kien diffiċli ħafna għalih.
I want to go home, he thought.	Irrid immur id-dar, ħaseb.
Something you still want.	Xi ħaġa għadha trid.
Look where you are.	Ħares fejn int.
I still have a lot of time	Għadni ħafna ħin
As I thought.	Kif ħsibt.
But we need your help.	Imma għandna bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
You don't have to.	M'għandekx għalfejn.
Come to that.	Ejja għal dak.
But he knew she was right.	Imma kien jaf li kellha raġun.
Now it was just me.	Issa kont jien biss.
I was not able to do that	Jien ma kontx kapaċi nagħmel hekk
There are few.	Ftit hemm.
Not so.	Mhux hekk hu.
Not too good, either.	Mhux wisq tajjeb, lanqas.
Same as above.	L-istess bħal hawn fuq.
I understand too well	Nifhem wisq tajjeb
He will not be back.	Mhux se jkun lura.
Truly, the only one.	Tassew, l-uniku wieħed.
I think we only need one	Naħseb li għandna bżonn wieħed biss
I saw that it was too late	Rajt li kien tard wisq
I couldn’t take all this	Ma stajtx nieħu dan kollu
I don’t even think about it afterwards	Lanqas ma naħseb dwarha wara
Or very few.	Jew ftit ħafna.
I will always believe that	Jien dejjem se nemmen li
I am very sorry about all that	Jiddispjaċini ħafna dwar dak kollu
I did this very early.	Dan għamilt kmieni ħafna.
I was just thinking about things	Kont biss naħseb dwar l-affarijiet
There will be.	Se jkun hemm.
I need to know how he is	Għandi bżonn inkun naf kif hu
I want to talk to him first	Irrid nitkellem miegħu l-ewwel ħaġa
We know he is with you.	Nafu li hu miegħek.
I could never have thought so.	Qatt ma stajt naħseb hekk.
Or too much of me.	Jew wisq minni.
I say so.	Jien ngħid hekk.
No, there was something else.	Le, kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
I think he knows that	Naħseb li jaf dan
I’ve been here before.	Jien kont hawn qabel.
I've been able to do something	Jien stajt nagħmel xi ħaġa
I think about it like everyone else does	Naħseb dwarha bħal kulħadd jagħmel
Not surprised, really.	Mhux sorpriż, tassew.
I’ve never heard too much	Qatt ma smajt wisq
It is and is not.	Huwa u mhux.
It wasn't so much.	Ma kienx daqshekk.
I couldn't be with him	Ma stajtx inkun miegħu
I went to the door	Jien mort lejn il-bieb
I know only one way to do this.	Naf mod wieħed biss biex nagħmel dan.
There are some things you can do.	Hemm xi affarijiet li tista 'tagħmel.
I was the only man there	Jien kont l-uniku raġel hemmhekk
I was busy.	Kont okkupat.
Which of course it was.	Li ovvjament kien.
In fact, few people do.	Fil-fatt, ftit nies jagħmlu.
You should never have seen this.	Inti qatt ma suppost rajt dan.
She will see that.	Hija se tara li.
My job is so good.	Ix-xogħol tiegħi huwa tajjeb hekk.
Look back at the house.	Ħares lura lejn id-dar.
I’m not afraid of anything.	Jien ma nibża xejn.
It wasn’t quite the same.	Ma kienx pjuttost l-istess.
It's time for him	Wasal iż-żmien għalih
I just want to take home with me	Irrid biss nieħu d-dar miegħi
No one was talking about it.	Ħadd ma kien qed jitkellem dwar dan.
I wonder where he is now	Nistaqsi fejn qiegħed issa
I may be able to.	I jista 'jkun kapaċi.
A man sat in the back.	Raġel poġġa bilqiegħda fuq wara.
I was great, actually.	Jien kont kbir, fil-fatt.
It would be better for us.	Ikun aħjar għalina.
I can do this at home myself	Jien nista’ nagħmel dan id-dar jien
I didn’t think anyone would do that to anyone	Ma kont naħseb li xi ħadd se jagħmel hekk għal xi ħadd
I never thought that	Jien qatt ma naħseb li
Well, he would have to take a chance.	Ukoll, kien ikollu jieħu ċans.
I didn't want to	Ma ridtx
I don’t think there is a need to do that.	Ma naħsibx li hemm bżonn tagħmel dan.
I think it needs some work.	Naħseb li jeħtieġ xi xogħol.
I can't do anything about it	Ma nista nagħmel xejn dwarha
Min.	Min.
I would never know this either.	Jien qatt ma nkun naf dan lanqas.
The same must be said.	L-istess għandi ngħidlek.
I never thought I would do anything like that	Qatt ma ħsibt li tagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik
I did everything yesterday and today	Jien għamilt kollox ilbieraħ u llum
I can see where this is going now.	Nista' nara fejn sejjer dan issa.
He was there, he did.	Huwa kien hemm, huwa għamel hekk.
He died well.	Miet tajjeb.
I can't believe she's mine	Ma nistax nemmen li hi tiegħi
Only time will tell.	Il-ħin biss jgħid.
I can't say what it is	Ma nistax ngħid x'inhu
Or maybe for some people.	Jew forsi għal xi nies.
I can't tell you anything more	Ma nistax ngħidlek xejn aktar
Now everything goes.	Issa kollox imur.
You don't, no.	Inti ma, le.
I want that too.	Irrid hekk ukoll.
I never told anyone	Qatt ma kont ngħid lil ħadd
She was.	Hija kienet.
I really think my friend was right	Verament naħseb li ħabib tiegħi kellu raġun
He seems to be afraid of nothing, either.	Huwa milli jidher jibża xejn, lanqas.
In fact, it looked pretty good today.	Fil-fatt, illum deher pjuttost tajjeb.
But no one is saying that.	Imma ħadd mhu qed jgħid hekk.
I think that was a bad idea	Naħseb li din kienet idea ħażina
Everyone who came here, everyone wants the same thing.	Kull min ġie hawn, kulħadd irid l-istess ħaġa.
I'm going, of course.	Jien immur, ovvjament.
I knew he was doing something.	Kont naf li kien qed jagħmel xi ħaġa.
This is a great thing for him.	Din hija ħaġa kbira għalih.
I knew better, of course.	Kont naf aħjar, ovvjament.
I was alone there	Jien kont waħdi hemmhekk
A man must do what a man must do.	Raġel irid jagħmel dak li raġel għandu jagħmel.
I have time.	Għandi ħin.
That’s probably wrong.	Dak probabbilment huwa ħażin.
It's not great.	Mhuwiex kbir.
I had to say she had one already	I kellha ngħid li kellha waħda diġà
It's going well.	Huwa sejjer tajjeb.
You look like you really wanted to.	Int qisu ridt tassew.
But that seems to have happened.	Imma dan jidher li ġara.
He never had any trouble leaving.	Hu qatt ma kellu xi problemi biex jitlaq.
Soon after, he did the same.	Ftit wara, għamel l-istess.
.	.
I haven't done anything in a long time	Ilni ma nagħmel xejn
It was still quite early.	Kien għadu pjuttost kmieni.
I wasn’t doing it	Jien ma kontx nagħmel
I know who you're talking about	Naf fuq min qed titkellem
It definitely won’t come.	Żgur li mhux se jiġi.
We did.	Għamilna.
I had no idea you could do that.	Ma kellix idea li tista' tagħmel dan.
I know who I listen to and who I don't	Naf lil min nisma’ u lil min le
A little at a time, of course	Ftit kull darba, ovvjament
I'll go before tomorrow.	Jien ser immur qabel għada.
I wanted to go to school	Ridt immur l-iskola
I can't be there anymore	Ma nistax inkun hemm aktar
Just bad for me.	Biss ħażin għalija.
Will buy there.	Se jixtri hemm.
I wanted it all to go away	Ridt li dan kollu jitlaq
I really like his stuff.	Inħobb ħafna l-affarijiet tiegħu.
I want to do this for you	Irrid nagħmel dan għalik
Good.	Tajjeb.
As far as I know.	Sa fejn naf jien.
How to do it ?.	Kif tagħmel dan?.
I want to know what he said	Irrid inkun naf affarijiet li qal
I never understand when he says so.	Qatt ma nifhem meta jgħid hekk.
If it isn’t, it should be.	Jekk ma jkunx, għandu jkun.
You make friends.	Inti tagħmel ħbieb.
Maybe he just wants to make sure he stays tonight.	Forsi jrid biss jagħmel ċert li toqgħod illejla.
I just need to be with you	Għandi biss bżonn inkun miegħek
He had to know better, really.	Huwa kellu jkun jaf aħjar, verament.
This was someone who was working to survive.	Dan kien xi ħadd li kien jaħdem biex jgħix.
That was never done to me.	Li qatt sar miegħi.
I’ve been sitting there for hours	Jien stajt noqgħod hemm għal sigħat
You may or may not like it.	Inti tista 'jew le bħal dan.
I was surprised when she did	I kien sorpriż meta hi ma
I did some work on this.	Għamilt xi xogħol fuq dan.
And not just mine.	U mhux tiegħi biss.
It’s time to leave, he thought.	Wasal iż-żmien li jitlaq, ħaseb.
I was just there.	Kont hemm biss.
I never.	Jien qatt.
I was easy either way	I kien faċli jew mod
When you eat, you eat.	Meta tiekol, tiekol.
I'll think for you from and a little more.	Jien ser naħseb għalik minn u ftit ieħor.
Or is it good for me.	Jew huwa tajjeb minni.
I wasn’t exactly sure	Ma kontx eżatt ċert
You and no one else.	Int u ħadd ieħor.
I am so glad you are here with me	Jien ferħan ħafna li qiegħed hawn miegħi
Does anyone else see this ?.	Xi ħadd ieħor jara dan?.
This will be wrong.	Dan se jkun ħażin.
Not here, where it would be seen by everyone.	Mhux hawn, fejn ikun jidher minn kulħadd.
But he is right.	Imma għandu raġun.
I should have known she wasn't	I kellha tkun naf li hi ma tkunx
This is not me.	Dan mhux jien.
Maybe nothing will happen.	Forsi mhu se jiġri xejn.
Nobody knew what to say.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x’għandu jgħid.
Maybe it was too good.	Forsi kien tajjeb wisq.
Which he could do.	Li seta’ jagħmel.
She knew better than to say nothing.	Kienet taf aħjar milli tgħid xejn.
I didn’t know about that	Ma kontx naf dwar dan
I was nothing but, really	Jien kont xejn imma, tassew
Never do anything else.	Qatt ma tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
One can only hope.	Wieħed jista 'biss jittama.
Maybe he wasn't a morning person.	Forsi ma kienx persuna ta’ filgħodu.
I know everyone wants to know	Naf li kulħadd irid ikun jaf
I would say that is not enough	Jien ngħid li mhux biżżejjed
Not so much anymore.	Mhux hekk aktar.
He just hopes it wasn’t too late.	Huwa biss jittama li ma kienx tard wisq.
I want to know why I did this	Irrid inkun naf għaliex għamilt dan
I know how tired you must be	Naf kemm trid tkun għajjien
And much more besides.	U ħafna aktar barra minn hekk.
I can't do anything alone	Ma nista’ nagħmel xejn waħdi aktar
I don't know who she is anymore	Ma nafx aktar min hi
It’s someone else out there.	Huwa xi ħadd ieħor hemmhekk.
I have been waiting for a very long time	Ilni nistenna għal żmien twil ħafna
I see you have a problem.	Nara li għandek problema.
I would be better off tomorrow.	Inkun aħjar għada.
I had never seen anything so beautiful	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa daqshekk sabiħa
He had had enough.	Huwa kellu biżżejjed.
I’m not trying to do anything	Jien ma nipprova nagħmel xejn
After that, not so much.	Wara dan, mhux daqshekk.
I haven't been here in a long time	Ilni ma kont hawn
Everything happens so fast.	Kollox jiġri hekk malajr.
I did, he thought.	Għamilt, ħaseb.
We are just friends.	Aħna biss ħbieb.
So small.	Hekk żgħir.
She did her best to.	Hija għamlet minn kollox biex.
She had done it.	Hija kienet għamlet dan.
I'm still so tired	Għadni daqshekk għajjien
Top on top.	Fuq fuq fuq.
I know where to go to school	Naf fejn tmur l-iskola
I know he didn’t but he did	Naf li ma kellux imma hekk għamel
There was always more.	Dejjem kien hemm aktar.
We weren’t out of anything.	Aħna ma konna barra xejn.
I need to do a few things	Għandi bżonn nagħmel ftit affarijiet
I really hope so.	Tassew nittama li hekk.
She was talking to someone.	Kienet titkellem ma’ xi ħadd.
I would like to go back with you.	Nixtieq immur lura miegħek.
There is just one other thing.	Hemm biss ħaġa oħra.
You have me.	Għandek lili'.
It also seems scary.	Barra minn hekk tidher jibża.
I didn’t want to talk about it	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwar dan
And another one.	U waħda oħra.
I'm a good man. 	Jien raġel tajjeb. 
I was no longer afraid	Ma kontx nibża aktar
We were friends, you know.	Konna ħbieb, taf.
I know a few people like that.	Naf ftit nies hekk.
Ridt.	Ridt.
It was ready.	Kien lest.
I thought everything would be better	Ħsibt li kollox ikun aħjar
Every single thing.	Kull ħaġa waħda.
But it happened.	Imma ġara.
I’m not sure if it will be.	M'inix ċert jekk hux se jkun.
I can’t believe he did such a thing.	Ma nistax nemmen li għamel ħaġa bħal din.
He is there now.	Huwa hemm issa.
Everyone takes what they take.	Kulħadd jieħu dak li jieħu.
That's what he does.	Huwa dak li jagħmel.
Maybe we really have it all back.	Forsi aħna verament għandna dan kollu lura.
I really didn't know that	I verament ma kontx naf li
Now tell me.	Issa tgħidli.
And that’s about it.	U dan huwa dwar dan.
I saw everything from above	Rajt kollox minn fuq
I think what I did needed to be done	Naħseb li dak li għamilt, kellu bżonn isir
Better go home now.	Aħjar tmur id-dar issa.
As you did.	Kif għamilt int.
It’s still early afternoon.	Għadu kmieni wara nofsinhar.
I can't wait any longer	Ma nistax nistenna aktar
He asked for more.	Huwa talab aktar.
I should have seen something.	I kellha rajt xi ħaġa.
You see things.	Qed tara l-affarijiet.
Not too bad.	Mhuwiex ħażin wisq.
I want your help	Nixtieq l-għajnuna tiegħek
I will have to talk to you.	Ikolli nitkellem miegħek.
I was happy with that	I kien kuntent b'dan
He really had to think about what he was doing.	Verament kellu jaħseb x’kien qed jagħmel.
I didn’t even think about it	Lanqas biss kont naħseb
But let's get here.	Imma ejja hawn.
I still can't do that.	Għadni ma nistax nagħmel dan.
He never did anything for you.	Hu qatt ma għamel xejn għalik.
If you can tell.	Jekk tista’ tgħid.
I had no idea how much	Ma kellix idea kemm
It can be helpful.	Jista 'jkun ta' għajnuna.
They are one and the same.	Huma wieħed u l-istess.
Not too late, not too early.	Mhux tard wisq, mhux kmieni wisq.
Everything back.	Kollox lura.
She was not.	Hija ma kinitx.
But it’s better than anything else out there.	Imma huwa aħjar minn kull ħaġa oħra hemmhekk.
That's a lot of help.	Dik hija ħafna għajnuna.
Or eat before you go.	Jew tiekol qabel tmur.
So glad to know you are back.	Hekk ferħan li tkun taf li inti lura.
I had to get back here as soon as possible	Kelli nerġa’ lura hawn kemm jista’ jkun malajr
There is nothing you can do about it.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel.
Too long, he thought.	Twil wisq, ħaseb.
We do the same job.	Nagħmlu l-istess xogħol.
I want more people to do that	Nixtieq li aktar nies jagħmlu dan
He was sure she did.	Kien ċert li għamlet.
I think it will be good	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb
I didn’t have to be here	Jien ma kellix inkun hawn
I’m sure you thought about it.	Jien ċert li ħsibt dwarha.
And he doesn’t.	U hu ma jagħmilx hekk.
I would tell someone there.	Jien ngħid lil xi ħadd hemmhekk.
In fact I think all mine	Fil-fatt naħseb li kollha tiegħi
He said he will wait.	Qal li se jistenna.
There will be no more.	Mhux se jkun hemm aktar.
I had nothing really	Jien ma kelli xejn verament
I knew it wasn’t going to be there	Kont naf li ma kienx se jkun hemm
I will have to be more.	Ikolli nkun aktar.
I’ve been here ever since	Jien ilni hawn minn dak iż-żmien
It seemed like a long time had passed	Deher li għadda żmien twil
I think this is it.	Naħseb li dan hu.
This has happened to me a few times.	Dan ġara lili ftit drabi.
He died three years later.	Miet tliet snin wara.
I did it too fast.	Għamilt malajr wisq.
He had nothing.	Ma kellu xejn.
I’m always tired, so tired	Jien dejjem għajjien, tant għajjien
But we will not go back.	Imma mhux se mmorru lura.
I know it took a long time	Naf li ħa ħafna ħin
You want to come with me now.	Trid tiġi miegħi issa.
Well, have mine.	Ukoll, għandhom tiegħi.
He had to leave quickly.	Kellu jitlaq malajr.
I wish it was, but it’s not.	Nixtieq li kien, imma mhux.
It will not be easy.	Mhux se jkun faċli.
I was glad for you.	Kont ferħan għalik.
I think we knew that	Naħseb li konna nafu dan
It seems like I can’t take it all in stride	Jidher li ma nistax nieħu dan kollu
There is really very little for you.	Hemm verament ftit li xejn għalik.
No one is too happy about it.	Ħadd mhu kuntent wisq dwar dan.
I never knew where he was coming from	Qatt ma kont naf minn fejn kien ġej
Now, everyone knows everyone and it’s harder.	Issa, kulħadd jaf lil kulħadd u huwa aktar diffiċli.
I could never hope to be	Qatt ma stajt nittama li nkun
Or, almost quickly.	Jew, kważi malajr.
This will help a lot.	Dan se jgħin ħafna.
I’m still not sure why this was	Għadni mhux ċert għaliex dan kien
I didn’t want that.	Jien ma ridtx hekk.
He still didn’t know everyone.	Għadu ma kienx jaf lil kulħadd.
I've never heard of this before and I have no idea.	Qatt ma smajt b’dan qabel u ma kelli l-ebda idea.
They have to.	Għandhom .
He didn’t need to think for a long time.	Ma kellux bżonn jaħseb għal żmien twil.
I, myself, had had enough	Jien, jiena, kelli biżżejjed
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
He thinks he knows everything.	Jaħseb li jaf kollox.
I didn’t want any more	Ma ridtx aktar
I didn’t want to know	Ma ridtx inkun naf
I think it was, like, a great thing	Naħseb li kienet, bħal, ħaġa kbira
I would be happy to do that !.	Inkun kuntent li nagħmel dan!.
I couldn't say that	Jien ma stajtx ngħid hekk
She will go to school with me, she says.	Hija se tmur l-iskola lili, hi tgħid.
I just got back from one I am.	Għadni kif ġejt lura minn wieħed jien.
It was fun, fun, fun.	Kien gost, gost, gost.
I will do no more	Mhux se nagħmel aktar
He had to go.	Kellu jmur.
I wasn’t happy about it, obviously	Jien ma kontx kuntent dwar dan, ovvjament
Today he says something, tomorrow he says something else.	Illum jgħid xi ħaġa, għada jgħid xi ħaġa oħra.
I thought everything I did was right	Ħsibt li dak kollu li għamilt kien tajjeb
I shouldn't have gone	Jien ma kellix mort
I knew it would be good	Kont naf li tkun tajjeb
Neither are you.	Lanqas int.
I think it wasn’t long ago	Naħseb li ma kienx twil ilu
I never thought it would be like that	Qatt ma kont naħseb li se jkun hekk
I don’t know why, she just does.	Ma nafx għaliex, hi biss tagħmel.
He didn’t want a job he loved.	Ma riedx xogħol li kien iħobb.
Not mine either, really.	Lanqas tiegħi, tassew.
I was there all the time	Jien kont hemm il-ħin kollu
I have some other things	Għandi xi affarijiet oħra
If not more.	Jekk mhux aktar.
Nothing happened.	Ma ġara xejn.
It never came.	Qatt ma wasal.
It's very good.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna.
A little for us.	Ftit għalina.
Like maybe every afternoon.	Bħal forsi kull wara nofsinhar.
There were many today.	Illum kien hemm ħafna.
Or maybe a friend.	Jew forsi xi ħabib.
He was not ready for it.	Ma kienx lest għalih.
I'll be fine in a few hours	Inkun tajjeb fi ftit sigħat
And other things.	U affarijiet oħra.
Over and over and over again.	Aktar u aktar u aktar mill-ġdid.
I just wanted to have fun with everyone	Ridt biss nieħu gost ma’ kulħadd
I’m not sure why this happens.	M'inix ċert għaliex jiġri dan.
I wish we could do that today	Nixtieq li nistgħu nagħmlu dan illum
A while ago, maybe	Ftit ilu, forsi
For me it’s easy.	Għalija huwa faċli.
I couldn’t believe he was gone forever	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien mar għal dejjem
You can only sit back for so long.	Tista 'biss toqgħod lura għal daqshekk twil.
I enjoy doing this for everyone	Jien nieħu gost nagħmel dan għal kulħadd
I want to see if it can be done.	Irrid nara jekk jistax isir.
It is a very beautiful thing.	Hija ħaġa sabiħa ħafna.
He usually didn’t do that.	Normalment ma kienx jagħmel dan.
But there are times.	Imma hemm drabi.
I don’t know why he did that.	Ma nafx għaliex għamel hekk.
If you are.	Jekk int.
I never knew this had happened	Jien qatt ma kont naf li ġara dan
I think there was a small one.	Naħseb li kien hemm wieħed żgħir.
I still think that.	Għadni naħseb li.
I can't understand this	Ma nistax nifhem dan
I'm happy with that	Jien kuntent b'dan
I just need to understand some things	Għandi bżonn biss nifhem xi affarijiet
I will have something for you next week for sure.	Ikolli xi ħaġa għalik il-ġimgħa d-dieħla żgur.
Obviously it won’t work for everyone.	Ovvjament mhux se jaħdem għal kulħadd.
One thing at a time, my friend.	Ħaġa waħda kull darba, ħabib tiegħi.
I would do a lot to take	Nixtieq nagħmel ħafna tieħu
I knew it was going to be very difficult	Kont naf li se jkun diffiċli ħafna
Great is great.	Kbir huwa kbir.
I have been thinking about this now.	Ilni naħseb dwar dan issa.
I just can’t stand it here	Jien biss ma nistax toqgħod hawn
I was not a very nice person	Jien ma kontx persuna sabiħa ħafna
He was always such a happy boy.	Dejjem kien tifel daqshekk ferħan.
Just the truth.	Biss il-verità.
And not every idea.	U mhux kull idea.
This is not going to happen to me.	Dan mhux se jiġri lili.
You don't want to do that.	Inti ma tridx tagħmel dan.
I can tell, and she can tell	Nista’ ngħid, u hi tista’ tgħid
I never thought so about any other man	Qatt ma kont ħsibt hekk dwar xi raġel ieħor
But someone else has to do it.	Imma xi ħadd ieħor għandu jagħmel dan.
I was here all the time, he thought	Kont hawn il-ħin kollu, ħaseb
Forever and ever.	Għal dejjem ta 'dejjem.
I need to try another	Għandi bżonn nipprova ieħor
So it was.	Hekk sar.
No one here is willing to help.	Ħadd hawn mhu lest li jgħin.
I don't believe it either	Lanqas jien ma nemmen
I know it will someday	Naf li se xi darba
I knew he was coming for me	Kont naf li kien ġej għalija
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx.
I will never do anything.	Qatt mhu se nagħmel xejn.
I could tell something was wrong	Jien stajt ngħid li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina
And mine were.	U tiegħi kienu.
Same as ever.	L-istess kif qatt kien.
Never anything more.	Qatt xejn aktar.
But it wasn’t good for him.	Imma ma kienx tajjeb għalih.
I can’t do it faster	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar malajr
Well, we know why.	Ukoll, nafu għaliex.
When it comes.	Meta tiġi.
Maybe he had.	Forsi kellu.
I know what that is.	Naf x'inhu dan.
You can see.	Inti tista tara.
More and more people are unemployed.	Aktar u aktar nies huma bla xogħol.
I did, a lot.	Għamilt, ħafna.
He didn't want to.	Ma riedx.
I was back.	Kont lura.
It would be so easy.	Ikun daqshekk faċli.
That wasn’t me.	Dak ma kontx jien.
I would always be an outsider	Jien dejjem inkun persuna barra
These are all problems.	Dawn kollha huma problemi.
I will do something for you	Jien se nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik
But why did this happen.	Imma għaliex ġara dan.
I will be there for you	Inkun hemm għalik
I hope you do as well.	Nispera li tagħmel ukoll.
I had no idea he was coming	Ma kellix idea li kien se jiġi
That was all.	Kien kollox.
I need to go home for a while	Għandi bżonn immur id-dar għal ftit
There had to be more.	Kellu jkun hemm aktar.
I didn’t really think about it	Fil-fatt ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan
I stay here early.	Jiena noqgħod minn hawn kmieni.
So much help is needed.	Tant hemm bżonn l-għajnuna.
But not today.	Imma mhux illum.
It has to be that way.	Irid ikun hekk.
All the time we were there I saw no one.	Il-ħin kollu li konna hemm ma rajt lil ħadd.
It's working now.	Issa qed jaħdem.
I'm not happy either.	Jien lanqas kuntent.
That’s bad enough.	Dak huwa ħażin biżżejjed.
The first is to speak.	L-ewwel huwa li titkellem.
But there is something more.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa aktar.
Well, yet.	Ukoll, għadu.
If not for you, than for me.	Jekk mhux għalik, milli għalija.
There is no going back.	M'hemm l-ebda tmur lura.
She looks too much like a child to me.	Hija tidher wisq bħal tifel għalija.
I’m not talking about that, he said.	Mhux qed nitkellem dwar dan, qal.
I didn’t want any	Jien ma ridt l-ebda waħda
For that may be.	Għal li jista 'jkun.
And this is something.	U din hija xi ħaġa.
There is nothing here.	M'hemm xejn hawn.
School is good.	L-iskola hija tajba.
He may be quite right.	Huwa jista 'jkun pjuttost raġun.
I didn’t believe it	Ma kontx nemmen
It will be better for a while.	Hija se tkun aħjar għal ftit żmien.
I really want to be your friend too	Nixtieq tassew inkun ħabib tiegħek ukoll
I just need a little help	Għandi bżonn biss ftit għajnuna
I'm too scared.	Jien nibża’ wisq.
I know we have great.	Naf li għandna kbira.
When it is good.	Meta jkun tajjeb.
I have a big problem	Għandi problema kbira
I'm wearing one now.	Jien liebes waħda issa.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwar dan.
I’m so tired today.	Jien daqshekk għajjien illum.
I'm not afraid of anything.	Jien ma nibża’ minn xejn.
I knew nothing	Jien ma kont naf xejn
If it’s not his, everyone is thinking he is.	Jekk mhux tiegħu, kulħadd qed jaħseb li hu.
I can wait until tomorrow	Nista' nistenna sa għada
It was me, just me.	Kont jien, jien biss.
Not bad.	Mhux ħażin.
And she's sure it's easy	U hi żgur li hija faċli
This may be the last time he has done this.	Jista’ jkun l-aħħar darba li għamel dan.
I did nothing wrong	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin
I thought I was going to be around tonight	Ħsibt li kont se tkun madwar illejla
He leaves tomorrow.	Hu jitlaq għada.
I thought I wanted to be more than that	Ħsibt li ridt tkun aktar minn hekk
A great way to go about it.	Mod tajjeb ħafna biex tmur madwar.
Not that there was much time to eat.	Mhux li kien hemm ħafna ħin biex tiekol.
I never had to do that	Qatt ma kelli nagħmel hekk
Do you come to me first ?.	Int tiġi għandi l-ewwel?.
I wonder why he is doing this	Nistaqsi għaliex qed jagħmel dan
Many things.	Ħafna affarijiet.
A man doesn't look so tired until	Raġel ma jidhirx daqshekk għajjien sakemm
And it’s working now.	U qed jaħdem issa.
Many times we are.	Ħafna drabi aħna.
This has actually been too long.	Dan fil-fatt ilu twil wisq.
I wanted to know things	Ridt inkun naf l-affarijiet
No one had ever asked.	Ħadd qatt ma kien talab.
And you don’t want that.	U ma tkunx trid hekk.
I wasn’t so sure	Jien ma kontx daqshekk ċert
That has been a very long time.	Dak ilu żmien twil ħafna.
He was like that for a while actually.	Huwa kien hekk għal xi żmien fil-fatt.
I just know it will happen someday	Naf biss li se jiġri xi darba
I see now.	Nara issa.
But she is not good.	Imma hi mhix tajba.
I couldn't see anything else	Ma stajt nara xejn aktar
This proves it.	Dan jipprova.
I saw that you were right	Rajt li kellek raġun
And she did.	U hi għamlet.
In fact, I've never been able to do that	Fil-fatt qatt ma stajt nagħmel dan
It's about how it's done.	Huwa dwar kif dan isir.
I can't understand this	Ma nistax nifhem dan
I didn’t do anything wrong.	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin.
No one knew where he came from.	Ħadd ma kien jaf minn fejn ġie.
He was a little more.	Huwa kien ftit aktar.
I want to talk about this.	Irrid nitkellem dwar dan.
I haven’t even thought about it before.	Lanqas ma ħsibt dwarha qabel.
You know.	Inti taf.
We never do that.	Aħna qatt ma nagħmlu dan.
I can't do this again	Ma nistax nagħmel dan mill-ġdid
I thought about it over and over	Ħsibt dwarha aktar u aktar
It says nothing about it.	Tgħid xejn dwarha.
I had to think of something	Kelli naħseb xi ħaġa
And this he never lost.	U dan qatt ma tilef.
No, more than great.	Le, aktar minn kbir.
A problem can be seen as follows.	Problema tista' tidher kif ġej.
She's too scared of anything.	Wisq jibża’ minn xi ħaġa.
She is never here.	Hija qatt ma hawn.
Now not so.	Issa mhux hekk.
He had such a difficult time.	Huwa kellu żmien diffiċli daqshekk.
I can't love anyone	Ma nistax inħobb lil ħadd
I know enough people to know this	Naf nies biżżejjed biex tkun taf dan
That was three years old.	Dak kellu tliet snin.
It would be easy enough.	Ikun faċli biżżejjed.
I heard a lot about it.	Smajt ħafna dwarha.
I could see it all again	Stajt nara dan kollu mill-ġdid
It was there.	Kien hemm.
I can't believe this will happen again	Ma nistax nemmen li dan jerġa' jiġri
She wasn’t the first.	Hija ma kinitx l-ewwel.
I did it myself.	Jien għamilt jien.
But neither is this happening.	Imma lanqas dan mhux qed jiġri.
I can’t wait to try	Ma nistax nistenna biex nipprova
If not, nothing is.	Jekk le, xejn mhu.
And you know and there.	U taf u hemm.
Try it !.	Ipprova!.
I didn’t want to know more people	Ma ridtx inkun naf aktar nies
I’m not doing that	Jien mhux qed nagħmel dan
There was little time for anything else.	Kien hemm ftit ħin għal xi ħaġa oħra.
But maybe this is too fast.	Imma forsi dan huwa malajr wisq.
Or both.	Jew it-tnejn.
I can't do anything	Jien, jien ma nista’ nagħmel xejn
Now nothing again.	Issa xejn mill-ġdid.
I see no problem with that.	Ma nara l-ebda problema b'dan.
Nobody has.	Ħadd ma għandu.
He wants to be a good man again.	Irid jerġa’ jkun raġel tajjeb.
But that is a problem.	Imma dik hija problema.
It doesn't have to be that way.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
I need to understand	Għandi bżonn nifhem
It will never happen again.	Qatt mhu se jerġa’ jkun hemm.
It wasn’t very pretty.	Ma tantx kienet sabiħa.
I have to do mine.	Ikolli nagħmel hekk tiegħi.
I have yet to try it all	Għadni għandi nipprova dan kollu
I hope you do more.	Nispera li tagħmel aktar.
I did nothing wrong	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin
I love how it came out	Inħobb kif ħareġ dan
I didn’t want to wait	Ma ridtx nistenna
Everything he loved.	Dak kollu li kien iħobb.
The, the.	Le, le.
I still wonder about that.	Għadni nistaqsi dwar dan.
Someone was still there, waiting.	Xi ħadd kien għadu hemm, jistenna.
I want to do this job	Irrid nagħmel dan ix-xogħol
I need your help	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek
I didn't want to talk	Ma ridtx nitkellem
I was being small	Jien kont qed inkun żgħir
To tell the truth, so was he.	Biex ngħid il-verità, hekk kien hu.
This is done a lot.	Dan isir ħafna.
It's too long.	Huwa twil wisq.
I don't even hesitate	Lanqas ma noqgħod lura
I didn’t know who he was at the time.	Ma kontx naf min kien dak iż-żmien.
You do it.	Inti tagħmel dan.
She often did.	Ħafna drabi kienet tagħmel.
That was how he knew she was going to be here.	Li kien kif kien jaf li kienet se tkun hawn.
No, it's more than that.	Le, huwa aktar minn hekk.
Nobody wanted to.	Ħadd ma ried.
She is so beautiful.	Hija tant sabiħa.
It's one on one.	Huwa wieħed fuq wieħed.
And he never did anything afterwards	U qatt ma għamel xejn wara
I need to take and take.	Għandi bżonn nieħu u nieħu.
I'm so happy for you	Jien tant kuntent għalik
It says nothing.	Ma jgħid xejn.
She’s being beautiful about it.	Hija qed tkun sabiħa dwarha.
You really shouldn’t talk to him like that.	Tassew m'għandekx titkellem miegħu hekk.
This is very difficult.	Dan huwa diffiċli ħafna.
No work too big or too small.	L-ebda xogħol kbir wisq jew żgħir wisq.
He told me about it.	Huwa qalli dwar dan.
I just couldn’t sit down.	I biss ma stajtx noqgħod bilqiegħda.
Everyone knows.	Kulħadd ikun jaf.
We are not doing that.	Aħna mhux qed nagħmlu hekk.
That’s who he is.	Dak hu min hu.
I don’t know why not.	Ma nafx għaliex le.
That’s what he wants to do.	Huwa dak li jrid jagħmel.
Only one.	Wieħed biss.
I wanted to hear that first	L-ewwel ridt nisma' dan
I have no idea why they will do that	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex se jagħmlu dan
I wish there was a time to do everything right	Nixtieq li jkun hemm żmien biex tagħmel kollox tajjeb
It often just looks like this	Ħafna drabi jidher biss bħal dan
I was doing something, he said.	Jien kont nagħmel xi ħaġa, qal.
I needed someone so much to talk	Tant kelli bżonn xi ħadd biex nitkellem
I knew he could and would do that	Kont naf li jista’ u kien se jagħmel hekk
There is nothing you can plan for.	Mhu xejn li tista' tippjana għalih.
Maybe you can.	Forsi tista’.
He said he would.	Huwa qal li kieku.
is.	huwa.
It was great to work with.	Kien kbir biex jaħdem miegħu.
I had to do it alone	Kelli nagħmel dan waħdi
That was a problem.	Din kienet problema.
I never wanted to do that.	Qatt ma ridt nagħmel hekk.
I understand everything	Nifhem kollox
You know where we want to go.	Taf fejn irridu mmorru.
He can do that.	Jista' jagħmel hekk.
I think he was doing.	Naħseb li kien qed jagħmel.
As long as you like.	Sakemm tixtieq.
I can’t say good enough about it.	Ma nistax ngħid biżżejjed tajjeb dwarha.
I just need some time	Għandi bżonn biss ftit ħin
Maybe he wasn’t alone as much as he thought.	Forsi ma kienx waħdu daqskemm ħaseb.
And now he expected to know everything.	U issa kien jistenna li jkun jaf kollox.
He had done nothing wrong.	Ma kien għamel xejn ħażin.
He could tell when he did too much.	Huwa seta 'jgħid meta għamel wisq.
I think it started there.	Naħseb li beda hemm.
I was sitting alone after all	Kont bilqiegħda waħdi wara kollox
Sorry it happened.	Jiddispjaċini li ġara.
I have school tomorrow	Għada għandi l-iskola
I hope we did.	Nispera li għamilna.
No one was talking.	Ħadd ma kien qed jitkellem.
The truth was, no one did.	Il-verità kienet, ħadd ma għamel.
It definitely looked that way.	Żgur li ħares hekk.
And someone is about to do it.	U xi ħadd wasal biex jagħmel dan.
Not only that.	Mhux biss.
I’ve been here before	Jien kont hawn qabel
I also needed to be ready	Jien ukoll kelli bżonn inkun lest
I was on to something	Kont fuq xi ħaġa
He said the following.	Huwa qal dan li ġej.
I really have to go now	I verament ikolli mmur issa
Everyone did the same.	Kulħadd għamel l-istess.
It hasn't been here long.	Ilu ma ilu hawn.
It was a long time before it came to me.	Kien żmien twil qabel ma ġie għalija.
I want to go with you	Irrid immur miegħek
But there is more to it than that.	Imma hemm aktar minn hekk.
He can leave here.	Jista' jitlaq minn hawn.
I think be the first	Naħseb li tkun l-ewwel
He just loved everything about everything.	Huwa biss iħobb kollox dwar kollox.
I want to stay	Nixtieq li jibqa’
I heard what you said	Smajt dak li tgħid
Everything was going to happen.	Kien jiġri dak kollu li kien se jiġri.
I didn't know what was going on.	Ma kontx naf x’qed jiġri.
No one ever lived there.	Qatt ma kien jgħix hemm ħadd.
That's coming.	Dak ġej.
Good and true.	Tajjeb u tassew.
I couldn’t tell how many there were	Ma stajtx ngħid kemm kien hemm
Well, there are many.	Ukoll, hemm ħafna.
I think this is actually ours	Naħseb li dan huwa fil-fatt tagħna
Which, of course, is not the case.	Li, ovvjament, hi mhix.
I don’t know why I thought so.	Ma nafx għaliex ħsibt hekk.
Or almost nothing.	Jew kważi xejn.
I can't hear anything, just like that	Ma nista’ nisma’ xejn, biss hekk
I did this once.	Għamilt dan darba.
He came to me.	Ġie għandi.
I knew that.	Jien kont naf dan.
What it is not, it is not.	Dak li mhuwiex, mhuwiex.
I don’t know about that.	Ma nafx dwar dan.
It would have been home.	Kien ikun id-dar.
I said I can't.	Għidt li ma tistax.
I can't believe what's going on	Ma nistax nemmen x’qed jiġri
Maybe he wasn’t even sure.	Forsi lanqas biss kien ċert.
I had never seen it before	Qatt ma kont rajt hekk qabel
This could be too.	Dan jista 'jkun ukoll.
It was a big deal.	Kienet xi ħaġa kbira.
There was just something so beautiful.	Kien hemm biss xi ħaġa sabiħa ħafna.
I'm afraid not much	Nibża li mhux ħafna
I didn’t have to	Jien ma kellix
I didn’t know it happened	Ma kontx naf li ġara
He will think you don't want to talk to him.	Huwa se jaħseb li ma tridx titkellem miegħu.
But there was no need for me to do anything.	Imma ma kienx hemm bżonn li nagħmel xejn.
This week could be harder.	Din il-ġimgħa tista' tkun aktar diffiċli.
I was just waiting	Kont nistenna biss
You were almost there.	Int kont kważi hemm.
I really can’t understand that.	Tassew ma nistax nifhem dik.
It will not do that.	Mhux se tagħmel dan.
It takes a lot longer.	Huwa jieħu ħafna aktar.
I was small at the time.	Kont żgħir dak iż-żmien.
I can't believe it either.	Lanqas nista’ nemmen dan.
I can't understand why.	Ma nistax nifhem għaliex.
What actually happened was something else again.	Dak li fil-fatt ġara kien xi ħaġa oħra mill-ġdid.
I wanted to know what was going on	Ridt inkun naf x’qed jiġri
There was something there after all.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk wara kollox.
Everything is happening.	Kollox qed jiġri.
Now we know this.	Issa nafu dan.
We have that one.	Għandna dik waħda.
It would be better.	Ikun aħjar.
I didn’t know how young he was at the time	Ma kontx naf kemm kien żgħir dak iż-żmien
How good is that ?.	Kemm hu tajjeb dak?.
She can do it wrong.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan ħażin.
I need to talk to him	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħu
Well, no, actually.	Ukoll, le, fil-fatt.
Obviously it’s wrong.	Ovvjament huwa ħażin.
I doubt he will ever return	Niddubita li qatt jerġa’ lura
And so it must be.	U dan għandu jkun hekk.
He told me so.	Huwa qalli hekk.
I still have a chance	Għadni rrid nieħu ċans
I couldn’t understand why this would be	Ma stajtx nifhem għaliex dan ikun
I still wasn't sure what would happen after that	Għadni ma kontx ċert x'kien se jiġri wara dak
Failure to do so is a problem.	Jekk ma jagħmilx hekk hemm problema.
I thought a lot about it today	Ħsibt ħafna dwarha llum
I think there was my problem	Naħseb li kien hemm il-problema tiegħi
She knew it was coming.	Kienet taf li kien se jiġi.
How beautiful you are.	Kemm inti sabiħa.
And so forever.	U hekk għal dejjem.
It was there.	Kien hemm.
He looked at everyone.	Huwa ħares lil kulħadd.
I don't want anything else	Ma rridx xi ħaġa oħra
And he’s probably right.	U probabbilment għandu raġun.
I fell in love with him	Kont inħobb miegħu
Needless to say	Ma kellix għalfejn ngħid wisq
I understand better than you know	Nifhem aħjar milli taf
Let's have.	Ejja għandna.
I'm glad you are.	Jien kuntent li int.
They were the same.	Kienu l-istess.
I went back and forth and back again	Mort lura u lura u lura mill-ġdid
I do on my own.	Nagħmel dwar tiegħi.
Few other people were doing either	Ftit nies oħra kienu qed jagħmlu jew
I need to have more fun	Għandi bżonn nieħu aktar gost
I want to be like that	Irrid inkun hekk
I want to be there, when you do.	Nixtieq inkun hemm, meta inti tagħmel.
Don't be late tomorrow.	Tkunx tard għada.
He’s a good man to be around.	Huwa raġel tajjeb li jkun madwar.
You must do these.	Int trid tagħmel dawn.
That was the last time.	Dik kienet l-aħħar darba.
Definitely want to say on this.	Żgur ikun irid jgħid fuq dan.
I wish there was another way.	Nixtieq li jkun hemm mod ieħor.
I didn't want to see or talk to anyone	Ma tantx ridt nara jew nitkellem ma’ ħadd
I didn’t want to be alone	Ma ridtx inkun waħdi
It was very early.	Kien kmieni ħafna.
Like, we had a lot of friends.	Bħal, kellna ħafna ħbieb.
I thought no one would be around	Ħsibt li ħadd ma jkun madwar
That's a boy.	Dak xi tifel.
This will be easy for you.	Dan se jkun faċli għalik.
I'm still here.	Għadni hawn.
I would be glad if that was the case	Inkun kuntent kieku hekk kien
You have to think of us.	Trid taħseb magħna.
I think otherwise.	Naħseb mod ieħor.
So he says here.	Hekk jgħid hawn.
I couldn’t think of anything else	Ma stajt naħseb dwar xi ħaġa oħra
Well, just one really.	Ukoll, wieħed biss verament.
I knew it was so much more than that	Kont naf li kien ħafna aktar minn hekk
I’ve done enough lately	Dan l-aħħar għamilt biżżejjed
And not easy.	U mhux faċli.
I wonder what is going on	Nistaqsi x’qed jiġri
You did nothing.	Inti ma għamilt xejn.
I would be alone.	Jien inkun waħdi.
It is still ahead of our time.	Għadu qabel iż-żmien tagħna.
It was good to be home.	Kien tajjeb li tkun id-dar.
He was gone.	Huwa kien telaq.
But no, it was too big to be mine.	Imma le, kienet kbira wisq biex tkun tiegħi.
I wish she was here now	Nixtieq li kienet hawn issa
Not sure just how much.	Mhux ċert eżatt kemm.
They weren’t really about anything.	Huma ma kienu verament dwar xejn.
I have a son, just over a year old	Għandi tifel, ftit aktar minn sena
What was he thinking?	X’kien qed jaħseb.
He said it was taking some time.	Qal li kien qed jieħu ftit ħin.
I knew she was going to be there	Kont naf li hi se tkun hemm
Well, he did.	Ukoll, huwa għamel dan.
That never happens to me.	Dak qatt ma jiġri għalija.
It could never be there.	Jista 'jkun hemm qatt.
I couldn’t take much more	Ma stajtx nieħu ħafna aktar
I understand that too	Nifhem hekk ukoll
I couldn’t do anything like that	Ma stajtx nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik
Never ever again.	Qatt qatt aktar.
Only when something goes wrong.	Biss meta xi ħaġa tmur ħażin.
A man.	Raġel.
He went faster.	Huwa mar aktar malajr.
It was a lot.	Kienet ħafna.
But you know, never take it.	Imma taf, qatt ma tieħu.
I want you to stay with me	Irrid li toqgħod miegħi
That's ready to go.	Dak lest biex imur.
It is here and now.	Huwa hawn u issa.
I would know if you do wrong.	Jien inkun naf jekk tagħmilx ħażin.
No, you can't do that.	Le, ma tistax tagħmel dan.
And sure, it was.	U żgur, kien.
Or better not do it.	Jew aħjar ma jagħmilx hekk.
Try it.	Jipprova.
I couldn't do that	Jien ma stajtx nagħmel hekk
Can you please tell me how to do this.	Tista' jekk jogħġbok tgħidli kif nagħmel dan.
I know you know what's going on	Naf li taf x’inhu jiġri
I want to know who is watching	Irrid inkun naf lil min qed jara
This was not to happen.	Dan ma kellux jiġri.
This is better.	Dan huwa aħjar.
We do that.	Aħna nagħmlu hekk.
Not easy.	Mhux faċli.
I'm the truth.	Jien il-verità.
But first you have to do something for me.	Imma l-ewwel trid tagħmel xi ħaġa għalija.
She does the same thing.	Hija tagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
I didn’t think it was going to come that fast	Ma kontx naħseb li kien se jiġi daqshekk malajr
I hope you can do it all	Nispera li inti tista 'tagħmel dan kollu
I think it probably will, actually.	Naħseb li probabbilment se, fil-fatt.
I'm not a morning person.	Jien m'iniex persuna ta' filgħodu.
As we should be.	Kif għandna nkunu.
He never had.	Hu qatt ma kellu.
After a while.	Wara ftit.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
Not that she was going to.	Mhux li kienet se.
I know he wants to come home.	Naf li jrid jiġi d-dar.
I have to go with this	Ikolli mmur ma 'dan
I can't wait any longer	Ma nistax nistenna aktar
It was really good.	Kien tassew tajjeb.
Who does this.	Min jagħmel dan.
I don’t think that’s what’s happening.	Ma naħsibx li dak li qed jiġri.
You have to tell me what’s coming.	Int għandek tgħidli x'inhu ġej.
I'm telling the truth	Qed ngħid il-verità
Good to stand for.	Tajjeb li toqgħod għal.
I was thinking about last night	Kont qed naħseb dwar ilbieraħ filgħaxija
I know what’s going on here.	Naf x'qed jiġri hawn.
It looks good isn't it.	Jidher tajjeb hux.
I was single until a few years ago	Kont wieħed sa ftit snin ilu
I didn’t know what to expect.	Ma kontx naf x'se nistenna.
But he didn’t have to.	Imma ma kellux.
I'm coming soon.	Jien ġej dalwaqt.
I knew exactly what was going to happen	Kont naf eżatt x’kien se jiġri
I really wish he was here now	Nixtieq tassew li kien hawn issa
I had heard enough	Kont smajt biżżejjed
I'd be fine, you see	Inkun tajjeb, tara
That was a good and bad time.	Dak kien żmien tajjeb u ħażin.
I have never had that before.	Qatt ma kelli dak qabel.
I hope he didn’t have anyone else with him	Jien nittama li ma kellux xi ħadd ieħor miegħu
I was already busy	Diġà kont okkupat
Having said that.	Wara li qal li.
It seems like a little bit	Jidher li jien ftit
It was all mine.	Kien kollu tiegħi.
He does not live.	Ma jgħix.
You are right.	Għandek raġun.
Well, you can.	Ukoll, tista '.
It would have been so easy, too.	Kien ikun daqshekk faċli, ukoll.
I don't see anyone.	Jien ma nara lil ħadd.
I have to tell you now.	Ikolli ngħidlek issa.
I have to do the same, he thought	Għandi nagħmel l-istess, ħaseb
I thought you would be interested	Ħsibt li inti tkun interessat
But he is not capable.	Imma hu mhux kapaċi.
It's still here.	Għadu hawn.
I just thought I’d ask	Ħsibt biss li nistaqsi
I didn’t even have much time to think about it	Lanqas ma kelli ħafna ħin biex naħseb dwarha
Time goes by.	Il-ħin imur.
Not a bad idea.	Mhux idea ħażina.
Alone, it’s nothing.	Waħdu, hu xejn.
That’s something to do well.	Dik hija xi ħaġa li tagħmel tajjeb.
He didn’t want to be his.	Ma riedx li tkun tiegħu.
I really wish it was	Nixtieq tassew li kien
It looked like one.	Deher qisu wieħed.
And it started.	U beda.
I thought he had come and gone.	Ħsibt li kien ġie u mar.
We were there for a while.	Konna hemm għal xi żmien.
Help is easier.	L-għajnuna hija aktar faċli.
I didn’t really want to be alone	Ma tantx ridt inkun waħdi
And you don’t.	U m'għandekx.
I'm so young.	Jien daqshekk żgħir.
I haven’t heard anything yet.	Għadni ma smajt xejn.
I have for some time now	Għandi għal xi żmien issa
You are very busy.	Int okkupat ħafna.
I need some time alone	Għandi bżonn ftit ħin waħdi
That may have been the case.	Jista 'jkun li kien hekk.
You don't even have to think so.	Lanqas trid taħseb hekk.
There they are.	Hemm huma.
This is not supposed to happen.	Dan mhux suppost jiġri.
It’s what you are.	Huwa dak li int.
I have no job.	M'għandix xogħol.
I really didn't want to be here anymore	Verament ma ridtx inkun hawn aktar
He did so.	Hekk għamel.
He went there.	Huwa mar hemm.
He can never come tomorrow.	Għada qatt ma jista’ jiġi.
I will understand something	Se nifhem xi ħaġa
There can never be too much of this.	Minn dan qatt ma jista’ jkun hemm wisq.
I have no idea who they are	M'għandi l-ebda idea min huma
I can’t wait to do that	Ma nistax nistenna li nagħmel dan
I have to be in school	Għandi nkun l-iskola
You have to tell me one of yours.	Trid tgħidli wieħed minn tiegħek.
It's just too late.	Huwa biss tard.
I didn’t have much money.	Ma kellix ħafna flus.
Can wait until later.	Jista' jistenna sa wara.
I know it makes me	Naf li jagħmel lili
At first I thought	L-ewwel ħsibt
I knew you were wrong	Kont naf li int kont ħażin
I believe everyone does.	Nemmen li kulħadd jagħmel.
It probably works.	Probabbilment jaħdem.
Difficult.	Diffiċli.
I knew exactly what it was	Kont naf eżatt x’kien
We both do.	Aħna t-tnejn nagħmlu.
I’m pretty sure of that.	Jiena pjuttost ċert minn dan.
Just not us.	Biss mhux aħna.
", and she".	", u hija ".
He was doing everything.	Kien qed jagħmel minn kollox.
I want to go to this school	Irrid immur din l-iskola
Alone.	Waħdi.
I know you want to go back to school	Naf li trid tmur lura l-iskola
If you think about it it doesn’t get any better.	Jekk taħseb dwarha ma tagħmilx aħjar.
What happened, has now passed.	Dak li ġara, issa għadda.
I want to do this on my own	Irrid nagħmel dan waħdi
It's time.	Wasal iż-żmien.
I was gone a long time ago	Jien kont mort ilu
He should try more.	Għandu jipprova aktar.
I would like to talk a little more about this stuff.	Nixtieq li jitkellem ftit aktar dwar dan l-affarijiet.
I was so scared of you	Jien kont tant jibża għalik
I just happened to be around	I biss ġara li kien madwar
I’m doing something wrong, but not sure where.	Qed nagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina, imma mhux ċert fejn.
I went there years ago	Mort hemm snin ilu
As you can see.	Kif tara.
I’m really, really great.	Jien tassew, tassew kbir.
Make friends wherever he goes.	Għamel ħbieb kull fejn imur.
And currently is not the time.	U bħalissa mhux il-ħin.
Everyone was ready to leave quickly.	Kulħadd kien lest jitlaq malajr.
Very good, very good.	Tajjeb ħafna, ħafna.
I want to do something great	Irrid nagħmel xi ħaġa kbira
I had nothing to say	Jien ma kelli ngħid xejn
But no, that's fine.	Imma le, dan huwa aħjar.
But there was no more.	Imma ma kienx hemm aktar.
I said I should buy one	Għidt li għandu jixtri wieħed
I have to try to think	Ikolli nipprova naħseb
I will not go back	Ma kontx se nerġa’ lura
We can do more.	Nistgħu nagħmlu aktar.
It's there or it's not.	Huwa hemm jew ma jkunx.
Maybe he was telling the truth.	Forsi kien qed jgħid il-verità.
I know he wants to come back.	Naf li jrid jerġa’ lura.
I knew what you were doing	Kont naf x'qed tagħmel
Maybe this will work.	Forsi dan se jaħdem.
I need to understand how I will do about it	Għandi bżonn nifhem kif se nagħmel dwarha
I can do something for you	Nista' nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik
It needs to happen too fast.	Jeħtieġ li jiġri wisq malajr.
He still doesn't know.	Għadu ma jafx.
He was really happy about it.	Kien tassew kuntent dwar dan.
I need you to see something.	Għandi bżonn li inti tara xi ħaġa.
I will.	Jien ser.
I never thought about it	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwar dan
You may not be obviously.	Inti tista 'ma tkunx ovvjament.
First I need to understand what is wrong	L-ewwel għandi bżonn nifhem x'inhu ħażin
I knew it and she knew it.	Kont naf u hi kienet taf.
He wants out.	Irid barra.
I wish I was here	Nixtieq li kont hawn
He knows he said too much.	Jaf li qal wisq.
All right now.	Kollox tajjeb issa.
I hope he’s around	Qed nittama li hu madwar
I just didn’t have time.	I biss ma kellix ħin.
There was much more.	Kien hemm ħafna aktar.
Who knows what he was thinking.	Min jaf x’kien qed jaħseb.
I should have known.	I kellha tkun naf.
His time has passed.	Żmien tiegħu għadda.
I’m telling you now.	Qed ngħidlek issa.
It did for me.	Għamel għalija.
I didn't even know what to say	Lanqas kont naf x’se ngħid
I don’t know where she is.	Ma nafx fejn hi.
I just want some time alone there	Irrid biss ftit ħin waħdi hemmhekk
But with just a little.	Imma bi ftit biss.
I thought it was pretty good	Ħsibt li ġie pjuttost tajjeb
She was a boy.	Kienet tifel.
Whether you want to be there or not.	Jekk tridx hemm jew le.
That was for sure.	Dak kien ċert.
It wasn’t enough, but we had to do something.	Ma kienx biżżejjed, imma kellna nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
I wasn’t there.	Jien ma kontx hemm.
Maybe you are right.	Forsi għandek raġun.
I wanted to talk	Ridt nitkellem
He goes home.	Imur id-dar.
Fear for me.	Jibża għalija.
It was being.	Kien qed.
But he was sure he was right.	Imma kien ċert li kellu raġun.
Not as far as I know.	Mhux sa fejn naf jien.
I'm trying to do that	Qed nipprova nagħmel hekk
I didn’t even see it coming	Jien lanqas ma rajt li ġej
And this he did not want.	U dan ma riedx.
I have to do this someday	Għandi nagħmel dan xi darba
There is only one problem.	Hemm problema waħda biss.
I hope you are right	Nispera li għandek raġun
Sure enough, this is just what happened to me.	Żgur biżżejjed, dan huwa biss dak li ġara lili.
Maybe this helps.	Forsi dan jgħin.
I don’t do the same thing, I do	Jien ma nagħmel l-istess ħaġa, jien
It wouldn’t be the only thing.	Ma tkunx l-unika ħaġa.
I have a lot.	Għandi ħafna.
I never thought that.	Qatt ma ħsibt li.
I was almost certain he was	Kont kważi ċert li kien
I did so as well.	Għamilt hekk ukoll.
I had a lot of friends	Kelli ħafna ħbieb
We are doing the same.	L-istess qed nagħmlu.
And so on.	U hekk ukoll.
I think I’ve heard it so often enough	Naħseb li smajt hekk spiss biżżejjed
He just did.	Huwa biss għamel.
I speak for you.	Jien nitkellem għalik.
At the time, everything was going well for him.	Dak iż-żmien, kollox kien sejjer tajjeb għalih.
He will be back.	Ser jerġa' lura.
We need yours as well.	Għandna bżonn tiegħek ukoll.
I couldn't go to school	Ma stajtx immur l-iskola
If it’s bad it’s bad.	Jekk huwa ħażin huwa ħażin.
I couldn't help but wonder why	Ma stajtx ma nafx għaliex
He probably won't be back for hours.	Probabbilment mhux se jkun lura għal sigħat.
It was a long time.	Kien żmien twil.
I really don’t know.	Jien verament ma nafx.
There were many.	Kien hemm ħafna.
It wasn’t big enough.	Ma kienx kbir biżżejjed.
But you are not so great.	Imma m'intix daqshekk kbir.
I thought.	Ħsibt.
I thought we’d be on that until now	Ħsibt li se nkunu fuq dak sa issa
Everything was a bit too much for him.	Kollox kien daqsxejn ħafna għalih.
Nobody told me anything.	Ħadd ma qalli xejn.
I wasn’t really sure who or what it was	Ma kontx verament ċert min jew lanqas x'kien
I had no idea.	Ma kellix idea.
There was a time for just one thing.	Kien hemm żmien għal ħaġa waħda biss.
This is not just me.	Dan mhux jien biss.
I haven't been in years	Ilni ma kontx snin
I know I wasn’t.	Naf li ma kontx.
I will always be early	Jien dejjem inkun kmieni
She is not.	Hija ma tkunx.
Maybe he should tell someone.	Forsi għandu jgħid lil xi ħadd.
Maybe he was right.	Forsi kellu raġun.
And that was that.	U dak kien dak.
I was really worried	Kont tassew inkwetat
I wasn’t ready for you.	Ma kontx lest għalik.
He died within a week.	Fi żmien il-ġimgħa miet.
I knew it wasn’t the same as people here	Kont naf li ma kienx l-istess bħal nies hawn
I need work.	Għandi bżonn ix-xogħol.
I know.	Kont naf.
I was afraid of nothing	Jien kont nibża’ minn xejn
Maybe it's good.	Forsi huwa tajjeb.
Very good time.	Żmien tajjeb ħafna.
It is very difficult to.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna li.
I wasn’t trying to be difficult	Ma kontx nipprova nkun diffiċli
I think you should go	Naħseb li għandek tmur
What you had to be.	Dak li kellek tkun.
It was something everyone could do.	Kienet xi ħaġa li kulħadd jista’ jagħmel.
It wasn't enough.	Ma kienx biżżejjed.
I have seen this too many times.	Rajt dan wisq drabi.
Someone who has something to say.	Xi ħadd li għandu xi jgħid.
This could not happen.	Dan ma setax jiġri.
You can.	Tista.
It's coming soon.	Hija dalwaqt.
I couldn’t think why	Ma stajtx naħseb għaliex
I like it so much.	Nixtieq hekk ħafna.
You want both.	Trid it-tnejn.
And he didn't.	U hu ma.
I want to know what's going on	Irrid inkun naf x’qed jiġri
I need to be with him now.	Għandi bżonn inkun miegħu issa.
I know you can do better	Naf li tista’ tagħmel aħjar
But she knew.	Imma hi kienet taf.
You will see this very soon.	Dan se tara malajr ħafna.
When will you be home.	Meta se tkun id-dar.
I didn’t go with him.	Jien ma mort miegħu.
I have no idea why he is here	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex hu hawn
But not yet.	Imma għadu mhux.
I needed to know if	Kelli bżonn inkun naf jekk
I still couldn't see anything	Għadni ma stajt nara xejn
He went out and came in.	Ħareġ u daħal.
It was still the same, she was still the same for him.	Kien għadu l-istess, hi kienet għadha l-istess għalih.
You know this one.	Inti taf dan wieħed.
I'm glad you're back	Jien kuntent li int lura
I love hearing what everyone has to say!	Inħobb nisma’ dak li kulħadd għandu xi jgħid!
I did nothing wrong	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin
Tell me if this is right or wrong.	Tgħidli jekk dan hux tajjeb jew ħażin.
It was already happening.	Diġà kien qed jiġri.
I will make time.	Se nagħmel ħin.
I want that to happen	Nixtieq li jiġri hekk
But it was I who went first.	Imma kont jien li mort l-ewwel.
He can do more.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel aktar.
Or is it somehow.	Jew huwa xi mod kif tagħmel.
It was so great.	Kien daqshekk kbir.
It can work.	Jista 'jaħdem.
Or maybe he just wanted it ready.	Jew forsi ried biss li dan ikun lest.
It would be good.	Ikun tajjeb.
When he thought of such things.	Meta ħaseb għal affarijiet bħal dawn.
I’ve wanted to tell you this for a while now.	Jien ridt ngħidlek dan għal xi żmien issa.
This looks pretty bad.	Dan jidher pjuttost ħażin.
But for me that's not my problem.	Imma għalija dik mhix il-problema tiegħi.
She was a boy.	Kienet tifel.
And nothing was working.	U xejn ma kien jaħdem.
I had to be that.	Jien kelli nkun dak.
It was better than that.	Kien aħjar minn hekk.
You better go.	Aħjar tmur.
I wasn’t sure.	Jien ma kontx ċert.
But of course she did.	Imma ovvjament hi għamlet.
I was out.	Kont barra.
Friend money.	Ħabib flus.
I have not seen such a thing for many, many years	Ilni ma nara ħaġa bħal din għal ħafna u ħafna snin
I really want to try this !.	Irrid verament nipprova dan!.
I didn’t need friends	Ma kellix bżonn ħbieb
I say this.	Jien ngħid dan.
I need to make it all go away	Għandi bżonn li tagħmel dan kollu jitlaq
It had to be him.	Kellu jkun hu.
It's probably good.	Hija probabbilment tajba.
It had happened a lot.	Kien ġara ħafna.
I need to think things through	Għandi bżonn naħseb l-affarijiet
But it was none of these things.	Imma ma kienet l-ebda waħda minn dawn l-affarijiet.
That too.	Dik ukoll.
I didn't hear anything.	Jien ma smajt xejn.
He was coming back now.	Kien ġej lura issa.
Sure, sure, that should be it.	Żgur, żgur, dan għandu jkun.
I couldn’t believe what he did	Ma stajtx nemmen dak li għamel
I'm not surprised.	Jien mhux sorpriż.
I had no idea why this was	Ma kelli l-ebda idea għaliex dan kien
I was not a child yet	Ma kontx għadni tifel
I was going to be a teacher	Kont se nkun għalliem
I'm happy for you, friend	Jien kuntent għalik, ħabib
I want our time together first	Irrid il-ħin tagħna flimkien l-ewwel
Everyone sat down.	Kulħadd poġġa bilqiegħda.
I haven’t been one for quite some time.	Jien ma kontx wieħed għal żmien pjuttost twil.
I think he’s there now	Naħseb li qiegħed hemm issa
It was good or better than they were.	Kien tajjeb jew aħjar milli kienu.
I was just a kid too	Jien kont biss tifel ukoll
She can do it.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan.
I don't eat anything either	Lanqas ma niekol xejn
Not so little, actually.	Mhux daqshekk ftit, fil-fatt.
I see you have what you need	Nara li għandek dak li għandek bżonn
I think you are wrong	Naħseb, li m'għandekx raġun
I knew exactly where I was going	Kont naf eżatt fejn għandi mmur
Not every man.	Mhux kull raġel.
I want this more than anything	Irrid dan aktar minn kull ħaġa
Or maybe he should.	Jew forsi għandu.
I think back to when it might have happened	Naħseb lura għal meta seta' ġara
Now that is too late.	Issa li huwa tard wisq.
I can't be with you again	Ma nistax inkun miegħek mill-ġdid
And he would do that too.	U kien jagħmel dan ukoll.
I’m still nothing but good.	Jien għadni xejn imma tajjeb.
I needed to know where she was	Kelli bżonn inkun naf fejn kienet
In fact, he didn't even know it.	Fil-fatt, lanqas biss kien jaf hu.
But not enough.	Imma mhux biżżejjed.
And of course, it was.	U ovvjament, kienet.
I have to be that.	Jien għandi nkun dak.
I couldn't want anything more	Ma stajt irrid xejn aktar
I wish he was still there when we did.	Nixtieq li kien għadu hemm meta għamilna.
And it was.	U kienet.
I thought she would be here	Ħsibt li se tkun hawn
I didn’t know it was there	Ma kontx naf li kien hemm
I can't do anything for you today	Ma nista nagħmel xejn għalik illum
I was doing that	Jien kont qed nagħmel hekk
She knew it had to be that way.	Hija kienet taf li għandu jkun hekk.
But he would.	Imma kien se.
I know.	Naf.
Or better yet, if.	Jew aħjar, jekk.
I love being with him	Inħobb inkun miegħu
Please say that it is good for me to do this.	Jekk jogħġbok għid li hu tajjeb għalija li nagħmel dan.
Maybe that would have been enough.	Forsi dan kien ikun biżżejjed.
Friend of a friend	Ħabib ta’ ħabib
It's just, like.	Huwa biss, bħal.
I just didn't think about it	I biss ma ħsibt dwar dan
I never expected that	Qatt ma kont nistenna dan
And so it must be by now.	U hekk għandu jkun minn issa.
It was still.	Kien għadu.
I need to know where you want to go	Għandi bżonn inkun naf fejn trid tmur
She was going to say no.	Kienet se tgħid le.
I did the same.	Għamilt l-istess.
I don't want that to happen.	Ma rridx li jiġri hekk.
I hardly thought so	Ma tantx kont naħseb hekk
There is no.	M'hemm l-ebda.
I wasn’t there and no one told me much	Jien ma kontx hemm u ħadd ma qalli ħafna
I think we should.	Naħseb li għandna.
I wasn't going to say that	Jien ma kontx se ngħid hekk
But me.	Imma lili.
What he does, they do.	Dak li jagħmel, jagħmlu.
It makes it look bad.	Jagħmel tidher ħażina.
she thinks.	taħseb hi.
It was here early.	Kien hawn kmieni.
I really thought it was you	Verament ħsibt li kont int
That's how it should be.	Hekk suppost kellha tkun.
He prayed for him.	Huwa talab għalih.
You are not well.	M'intix tajjeb.
Look at that now.	Ħares lejn dak issa.
It was so great.	Kien hekk tajjeb ħafna.
Nothing happened, which was good.	Ma ġara xejn, li kien tajjeb.
I have never thought about this before	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan qabel
I couldn't believe it	Ma stajtx nemmen dan
He was glad for that.	Huwa kien ferħan għal dan.
He knew he had no chance.	Kien jaf li ma kellux ċans.
That will be quite difficult.	Dak se jkun pjuttost diffiċli.
I wasn’t good at waiting	Ma kontx tajjeb nistenna
I know you know that.	Naf li taf dan.
I believe I did as I said I would do.	Nemmen li għamilt kif għedt li se tagħmel.
Obviously, we know everything about.	Ovvjament, nafu kollox dwar.
I just wish there was someone else	Nixtieq biss li jkun hemm xi ħadd ieħor
One job per year, per year.	Xogħol wieħed kull sena, kull sena.
I also like to go alone	Inħobb ukoll immur waħdi
I didn't really need you to do that	I ma tantx kelli bżonn inti tagħmel dan
I had never done that before.	Qatt ma kont għamilt hekk qabel.
I thought better	Ħsibt aħjar
I know your work very well	Naf ix-xogħol tiegħek tajjeb ħafna
But many were.	Imma ħafna kienu.
He was such a good man.	Kien raġel daqshekk tajjeb.
I'm like that too.	Jien hekk ukoll.
It's good or bad.	Huwa tajjeb jew ħażin.
It's easy to do.	Huwa faċli li tagħmel.
I want everything now	Irrid kollox issa
I really, really did	Jien tassew, tassew għamilt
Nothing like this happened.	Ma ġara xejn bħal dan.
It's easier than you might think.	Huwa aktar faċli milli inti tista 'taħseb.
I haven't said anything yet	Għadni ma għedt xejn
I had to take it with me	I kellha tieħu miegħi
Nothing bad happened.	Ma ġara xejn ħażin.
I don’t think he is.	Ma naħsibx li hu.
She says he is home.	Hi tgħid li hu d-dar.
I’m obviously happy about that	Jien ovvjament kuntent dwar dan
I needed someone who knew what he was doing	Kelli bżonn xi ħadd li kien jaf x’qed jagħmel
I was too surprised to speak	Kont sorpriż wisq biex nitkellem
So are we.	Hekk aħna.
I was not with anyone	Jien ma kont ma’ ħadd
Something about it.	Xi ħaġa dwar dan.
I think it was there	Naħseb li kien hemm
I did all this for you	Dan kollu għamilt għalik
Not much later.	Mhux wisq aktar tard.
I just couldn't take it anymore	I biss ma stajtx tieħu aktar
I had thought about it.	I kellha ħsibt dwar dan.
It must be so.	Għandu jkun hekk.
Everything was going so well.	Kollox kien sejjer daqshekk tajjeb.
I didn't know who to take	Ma kontx naf ta’ min se nieħu
There could have been more.	Seta’ kien hemm aktar.
I wasn’t there yet, but soon	Għadni ma kontx hemm, imma dalwaqt
I wanted this.	Ridt dan.
She says nothing about it.	Hija ma tgħid xejn dwar dan.
I’m not doing that.	Jien mhux qed nagħmel dan.
I wonder who it might be	Nistaqsi min jista’ jkun
That was better.	Dak kien aħjar.
And it probably never will.	U x'aktarx qatt ma se.
I didn't want to say anything	Ma ridt ngħid xejn
In fact, it can work.	Fil-fatt, dan jista 'jaħdem.
It doesn’t seem to have been there.	Ma jidhirx li kien hemm.
Someone you want to know.	Xi ħadd li trid tkun taf.
I knew there was so much more for you	Kont naf li kien hemm ħafna aktar għalik
It was so long ago.	Kien tant ilu.
Most people don't.	Ħafna nies ma.
He needed to talk.	Kellu bżonn jitkellem.
But not yours.	Imma mhux tiegħek.
It would take too long.	Ikun jieħu wisq żmien.
Not even about that.	Lanqas dwar dan.
That's it.	Dik hija dik.
We knew it had to come.	Konna nafu li kellha tiġi.
But not the same as being alone.	Imma mhux l-istess bħal li tkun waħdu.
That was good for us.	Dan kien tajjeb magħna.
How everything happens.	Kif jiġri kollox.
No one else will.	Ħadd ieħor ma se.
Let's go.	Ejja mmorru.
We were supposed to, but no one really.	Konna suppost, imma ħadd ma verament.
There wasn’t much you could do about it.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
I hope this helps !.	Nispera li dan jgħin!.
Like a person.	Bħal persuna.
I have to wait.	Ikolli nistenna.
You should too.	Għandek ukoll.
Please.	Jekk jogħġbok.
It’s hard for me.	Huwa diffiċli għalija.
I know he knows	Naf li jaf
That's a bit late.	Dak daqsxejn tard.
Besides, he had little to say.	Barra minn hekk, ma tantx kellu xi jgħid.
It was never good.	Qatt ma kien tajjeb.
Obviously this is not so.	Ovvjament dan mhux hekk.
But there is the same.	Imma hemm l-istess.
He had done nothing wrong.	Huwa kien għamel xejn ħażin.
I thought he was another year old	Ħsibt li kellu sena oħra
I just won’t do it.	Jien biss mhux se nagħmel dan.
I want it to be the same as mine	Irrid li tkun l-istess tiegħi
It may be a bit late	Jista' jkun daqsxejn tard
You know nothing.	Ma taf xejn.
I could never tell if it was good or bad	Qatt ma stajt ngħid jekk kienx tajjeb jew ħażin
I need to know something	Ikolli nkun naf xi ħaġa
Before you go any further.	Qabel ma tmur aktar.
I love being with you	Inħobb inkun miegħek
Faster.	Aktar malajr.
You were here.	Inti kont hawn.
I wonder what is going on	Nistaqsi x’qed jiġri
I wanted to be someone.	Ridt inkun xi ħadd.
This was the house, and it was here.	Din kienet id-dar, u kien hawn.
You see, it’s easier for everyone.	Tara, huwa aktar faċli għal kulħadd.
He was not seeing anything.	Ma kien qed jara xejn.
It’s nothing much.	Mhu xejn ħafna.
What is there.	X'se hi.
I definitely hope he knew where he was going	Żgur nittama li kien jaf fejn sejjer
I wasn’t sure how much	Ma kontx ċert kemm
I know what	Naf x'inhu
And he wants a little more.	U jrid ftit aktar.
I knew exactly who he was	Kont naf eżatt min kien
I have to do it now.	Għandi nagħmel dan issa.
I couldn’t understand how they do it.	Ma stajtx nifhem kif jagħmlu dan.
I couldn’t do any of these	Jien ma stajt nagħmel l-ebda waħda minn dawn
It seems to me, too.	Jidher miegħi, ukoll.
I can’t believe she really is mine	Ma nistax nemmen li hi tassew li tkun tiegħi
I think the time had come	Naħseb li kien wasal iż-żmien
I just want to go home now	Irrid biss immur id-dar issa
I want you to be happy for me	Irrid li tkun ferħan għalija
Not that that's a bad thing.	Mhux li dik hija ħaġa ħażina.
I never had any of that	Qatt ma kelli xejn minn hekk
For me and for me, sure.	Għalija u għalija, żgur.
No one else was there.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien hemm.
I was there alone.	Jien kont hemmhekk waħdi.
You can do that.	Tista' tagħmel hekk.
I was pretty sure of that	Jien kont pjuttost ċert minn dan
He did.	Dan għamel.
When you are not around.	Meta ma tkunx madwar.
Now it was time.	Issa kien wasal.
I wanted both, but I couldn't have either	Ridt it-tnejn, imma ma setax ikolli l-ebda waħda
You are not enough.	M'intix biżżejjed.
I was just surprised he was playing.	Kont biss sorpriż li kien qed jilgħab.
Not good.	Mhux tajjeb.
But nothing much.	Imma xejn ħafna.
I need to know these things	Għandi bżonn inkun naf dawn l-affarijiet
It really did very well.	Verament sar tajjeb ħafna.
It could be something else.	Jista 'jkun xi ħaġa oħra.
You are back.	Inti lura.
I think it has been there for a long time	Naħseb li ilu hemm
They have things.	Huma għandhom affarijiet.
And so it must be.	U dan għandu jkun hekk.
This is something else.	Din hija xi ħaġa oħra.
I hope this helps someone.	Nittama li dan ikun ta' għajnuna għal xi ħadd.
But it was none of that.	Imma ma kien xejn minn hekk.
You know you don't you can't think of anything.	Inti taf li inti ma inti ma tistax taħseb ta 'xejn.
And it seems to be working.	U jidher li qed jaħdem.
I thought a lot.	Ħsibt ħafna.
Here now.	Hawn issa.
I want to know	Irrid inkun naf
We can do better than that.	Nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar minn hekk.
Come on, you know what you want.	Ejja, taf li trid.
To be or not to be.	Li tkun jew li ma tkunx.
I had no idea where to go.	Ma kellix idea fejn immur.
I knew it was going to be a big deal	Kont naf li se tkun xi ħaġa kbira
I went on.	Mort fuq.
I didn’t want it that way, but that was it.	Ma ridtx hekk, imma hekk kien.
As everyone does.	Kif jagħmel kulħadd.
Please, no more.	Jekk jogħġbok, mhux aktar.
It was up to me to talk to him.	Ġie minni nitkellem miegħu.
I wasn’t sure	Jien ma kontx ċert
I didn't know what to say	Ma tantx kont naf x’qed jgħid
It always has been, and always will be.	Dejjem kien, u dejjem se jkun.
This may be what is happening here.	Dan jista 'jkun dak li qed jiġri hawn.
And so it should be.	U hekk għandu jkun.
I could see it coming from here	Stajt nara li ġej minn hawn
Everything is fine.	Kollox huwa tajjeb.
He would have to try again.	Huwa jkollu jerġa' jipprova.
I know what was going on	Naf x’kien qed jiġri
It’s the same as with you.	Huwa l-istess bħal miegħek.
That's great.	Dak hu kbir.
It was not time for work.	Ma kienx żmien għal xogħol.
I wasn't sure where he was	Ma kontx ċert fejn kien
There is more, everyone.	Hemm aktar, kulħadd.
He was just sitting there.	Kien biss bilqiegħda hemm.
I need to talk to him before he goes.	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħu qabel imur.
She had to do something.	Kellha tagħmel xi ħaġa.
It’s still great now.	Għadu kbir issa.
I think he’s just scared	Naħseb li hu biss jibża
He never had a problem.	Qatt ma kellu problema.
But that should come later.	Imma dan għandu jiġi aktar tard.
There is no such thing now.	M'hemm l-ebda ħaġa bħal din issa.
Maybe so too.	Forsi hekk ukoll.
But it can't be.	Imma ma jistax ikun.
I will never talk to you	Jien qatt mhu se nitkellem miegħek
You know what he wanted.	Taf xi ried.
He never had a chance.	Qatt ma kellu l-ebda ċans.
That’s his help.	Dik hija l-għajnuna tiegħu.
But you are the last.	Imma int l-aħħar.
He can thing about anything.	Huwa jista 'ħaġa dwar xi ħaġa.
As much as we want.	Kemm irridu.
I want you to think about something	Irrid li taħseb dwar xi ħaġa
And why did you come to me.	U għaliex ġejt għandi.
You just need to be doing this long enough.	Int biss bżonn li tkun qed tagħmel dan għal żmien twil biżżejjed.
That's really good.	Dak tassew tajjeb.
I thought it was no no.	Ħsibt li kien le le.
I was listening to what you were saying	Kont qed nisma’ dak li qed tgħid
I wasn’t even expecting it	Jien lanqas ma kont qed nistenna
I wasn't sure what happened	Ma kontx ċert x’ġara
You know we have.	Taf li għandna.
But there will be.	Imma se jkun hemm.
Maybe it will be in the morning.	Forsi se jkun filgħodu.
I didn’t even want to.	Lanqas ridt.
I wasn't great about it	I ma kienx kbir dwar dan
I should have known that was not the case	I kellha naf li ma kienx hekk
I don’t want to believe this	Ma rridx nemmen dan
I need something else	Għandi bżonn xi ħaġa oħra
Just really, they are.	Biss verament, huma.
After that it became a little easier.	Wara dan sar ftit aktar faċli.
I didn’t stay here like that	Jien ma kontx noqgħod hawn hekk
Good boy.	Tifel tajjeb.
I hope you wish it was.	Nispera li tixtieq li kien.
It has to happen someday.	Irid jiġri xi darba.
I haven't been here in a long time.	Jien ilni ma kont hawn.
We just did the work.	Għamilna biss ix-xogħol.
Pretty fast, actually.	Pjuttost malajr, fil-fatt.
He didn’t even know there was one.	Hu lanqas biss kien jaf li kien hemm wieħed.
And you know more than that.	U taf aktar minn hekk.
We need help.	Għandna bżonn l-għajnuna.
I think I said enough	Naħseb li għidt biżżejjed
We will be back soon !.	Se nkunu lura dalwaqt!.
You’re here now, and there’s plenty of time.	Int hawn issa, u hemm ħafna ħin.
He knew all the time she was there, of course.	Huwa kien jaf il-ħin kollu li kienet hemm, ovvjament.
I just want to be there for you	Nixtieq biss li nkun hemm għalik
I see everyone and how they do things.	Nara lil kulħadd u kif jagħmlu l-affarijiet.
And so he did.	U hekk għamel.
It may not always be so.	Jista 'mhux dejjem ikun hekk.
I couldn't speak.	Ma stajtx nitkellem.
I didn’t have to eat that much	Ma kellix niekol daqshekk
You probably wanted to	Probabbilment ridt
They really are.	Huma verament.
I think you have as good a chance as anyone	Naħseb li għandek ċans tajjeb daqs xi ħadd
I was never going back.	Qatt ma kont sejjer lura.
I want to know the truth	Irrid inkun naf il-verità
I have.	Jien għandi.
I don’t even have to think about it.	Lanqas ikolli għalfejn naħseb dwarha.
But after that it's really fun !.	Imma wara minn dak verament gost!.
He was talking.	Kien qed jitkellem.
Now I see.	Issa nara.
I couldn’t do this without your work.	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan mingħajr ix-xogħol tiegħek.
I wonder if it’s okay	Nistaqsi jekk hux tajjeb
I want him to keep talking.	Irrid li jibqa’ jitkellem.
No one had thought about it at the time.	Ħadd ma kien ħaseb xejn dwarha dak iż-żmien.
I think she would want that too	Naħseb hi tkun trid hekk ukoll
I’m glad it was wrong.	Jien kuntent li kien ħażin.
I did this last night	Għamilt dan ilbieraħ filgħaxija
I never do myself	Jien qatt ma nagħmel jien
But not quite there.	Imma mhux pjuttost hemm.
He hadn't said that.	Ma kellux qal hekk.
I have done this many times	Għamilt dan ħafna drabi
I never knew why	Qatt ma kont naf għaliex
I never know how to say it	Qatt ma naf kif ngħid dan
Did you know.	Kont taf.
And you can't go back now.	U inti ma tistax lura issa.
Want, want, want !.	Trid, trid, trid!.
It’s quite something, actually.	Hija xi ħaġa pjuttost, fil-fatt.
It never happened.	Qatt ma kien jiġri.
This is a one-time affair.	Din hija ħaġa ta' darba biss.
I was right to come here.	Kelli raġun li ġejt hawn.
It can only be one way.	Jista 'jkun biss mod wieħed.
He would not have looked at.	Ma kienx ikun ħares lejn.
This happens to many people.	Dan jiġri lil ħafna nies.
I didn’t want to try any more	Ma ridtx nipprova ftit aktar
But it will never happen again.	Imma qatt mhu se jerġa’ jiġri.
I was really interested	Kont verament interessat
Or so it was.	Jew hekk kien.
I will do the first thing tomorrow morning	Se nagħmel l-ewwel ħaġa għada filgħodu
He shouldn't have.	M'għandux ikollu.
I think it always will	Naħseb li dejjem se
Not too much here.	Mhux wisq hawn.
I didn’t want to.	Jien ma ridtx.
It also seemed pretty bad for us.	Deher ukoll pjuttost ħażin għalina.
He just loves to play.	Huwa biss iħobb jilgħab.
Well not as it actually was.	Ukoll mhux kif fil-fatt kien.
He can speak.	Jista’ jitkellem.
Look better too.	Ħares aħjar ukoll.
But we really want it to come, of course.	Imma tassew irridu li tiġi, ovvjament.
No, not often.	Le, mhux ħafna drabi.
We did a bad job.	Għamilna xogħol ħażin.
I can’t say that about most people	Ma nistax ngħid hekk dwar ħafna nies
There was nothing anyone could do.	Ma kien hemm xejn xi ħadd jista 'jagħmel.
Where are you ?.	Fejn int?.
I know I couldn’t be you	Naf li ma setax kont int
I can't be happier	Ma nistax inkun aktar kuntent
I can't do anything about it	Ma nista nagħmel xejn dwar dan
But that’s hard to say.	Imma dak diffiċli ngħid.
That was never very likely.	Dak qatt ma kien probabbli ħafna.
There was none of that.	Ma kien hemm xejn minn hekk.
They don't.	Huma ma.
So was everyone.	Hekk kien kulħadd.
He had no idea how long.	Ma kellux idea għal kemm żmien.
I wasn’t happy about that	Ma kontx kuntent dwar dan
I needed to think about everything	Kelli bżonn naħseb dwar kollox
I haven’t heard anything about it	Jien ma smajt xejn dwar dan
He will not come.	Hu mhux se jiġi.
Maybe it would be a good thing.	Forsi tkun xi ħaġa tajba.
That he will.	Li hu se.
I want to see that.	Irrid nara dak.
I can’t believe any of this is happening	Ma nistax nemmen li xi ħaġa minn dan qed jiġri
Everyone is tired.	Kulħadd ikun għajjien.
That would have been easy too.	Dan kien ikun faċli wisq.
I think you can tell how much fun everyone had	Naħseb li tista’ tgħid kemm ħa gost kulħadd
He only talks to a few people.	Jitkellem biss ma’ ftit nies.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Forsi ftit, forsi ħafna.
You will know.	Inti se tkun taf.
Everything is great.	Kollox huwa kbir.
I have never been before	Qatt ma kont qabel
So are you.	Hekk int ukoll.
He said he was not.	Qal li ma kienx.
I never do that.	Jien qatt ma nagħmel hekk.
She knew this was coming.	Kienet taf li dan kien se jiġi.
I want to say more.	Irrid li jgħid aktar.
I would be all you need	Jien inkun dak kollu li għandek bżonn
I did what he wanted, when he wanted	Għamilt li ried hu, meta ried
Time had passed too quickly.	Iż-żmien kien għadda malajr wisq.
I wasn’t sure how to say it	Ma kontx ċert kif ngħid
So many times.	Tant drabi.
I will never say.	Qatt mhu se ngħid.
I was doing the same thing	Kont qed nagħmel l-istess ħaġa
In fact he was a pretty nice person.	Fil-fatt kien persuna pjuttost sabiħa.
See here.	Tara hawn.
I have never said anything like this	Qatt ma għedt xi ħaġa bħal din
I wasn’t really surprised	Ma kontx verament sorpriż
You want to know everything.	Trid tkun taf kollox.
I think it was a long time ago	Naħseb li kien żmien twil ilu
I didn’t even know where he lived	Lanqas kont naf fejn jgħix
Today it would be nothing.	Illum ma jkun xejn.
It will take some work.	Ser jieħu xi xogħol.
He did it when he was young.	Huwa għamel meta kien żgħir.
Now he knew it was he who died.	Issa kien jaf li kien hu li miet.
I wish this was our home, but it’s not	Nixtieq li din kienet id-dar tagħna, imma mhix
It was so good	Kien daqshekk tajjeb
I think there are a few things	Naħseb li hemm ftit affarijiet
Apparently this was not going as he thought.	Jidher li dan ma kienx sejjer kif ħaseb hu.
I had to think about this for a while	Kelli naħseb dwar dan għal xi żmien
He did so.	Hekk għamel.
He could not speak or think.	Ma setax jitkellem u lanqas jaħseb.
I was ready to try	Kont lest li nipprova
I don’t know anything about this really.	Jien ma naf xejn dwar dan verament.
I want to know who.	Irrid inkun naf min.
Don't be so.	Tkunx hekk.
But no, not too much.	Imma le, mhux wisq.
I was doing pretty well actually	Jien kont sejjer pjuttost tajjeb fil-fatt
He started back.	Beda lura.
A lot has happened.	Ġara ħafna.
He takes nothing.	Hu ma jieħu xejn.
I couldn't believe what was happening	Ma stajtx nemmen x’kien qed jiġri
She was right, too.	Hija kellha raġun, ukoll.
I can't do anything	Jien ma nista nagħmel xejn
Definitely not for me.	Żgur li ma kienx għalija.
Not now, and not later.	Mhux issa, u mhux aktar tard.
He says he will do it later.	Jgħid li se jagħmel dan aktar tard.
She wasn’t thinking about it.	Hija ma kinitx taħseb dwar dan.
I knew he wanted to survive	Kont naf li ried jgħix
I still believe there is a chance.	Għadni nemmen li hemm ċans.
I have no problem with that	M'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan
Really great idea.	Idea tassew kbira.
I wonder what he will do about it	Nistaqsi x’se jagħmel dwarha
I was hoping it would	Kont qed nittama li kieku
I can’t take it, and I won’t take it, anymore	Ma nistax nieħu, u mhux se nieħu, aktar
He told me he didn't know.	Qalli li ma jafx.
He became expectant.	Huwa sar jistenna.
I didn’t want that to happen	Jien ma ridtx li jiġri
He was not alone in being alone.	Ma kienx waħdu li kien waħdu.
Now I know she was right.	Issa naf li kellha raġun.
They felt great.	Ħassu kbir.
I needed to not think	Kelli bżonn li ma naħsibx
It wasn’t going well.	Ma kienx sejjer tajjeb.
I never thought it would happen	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jiġri
I need you to tell me something	Għandi bżonn li tgħidli xi ħaġa
Surely he wanted to be more than anything.	Żgur li ried li jkun hu aktar minn kull ħaġa.
She needed to be someone else.	Hija kellha bżonn tkun xi ħadd ieħor.
I’m never going to be good, and that’s not bad	Jien qatt mhu se nkun tajjeb, u dan mhux ħażin
I really, very much regret it	Jien tassew, ħafna jiddispjaċini
Here's another one.	Hawn ieħor.
I was happy for something	Kont kuntent għal xi ħaġa
It was morning.	Kien filgħodu.
He doesn't know who he is.	Ma jafx min hu.
And he.	U hu.
But look at everyone.	Imma ħares lejn kulħadd.
I think maybe he knew	Naħseb li forsi kien jaf
I'm friends with just me	Jien ħbieb ma' ftit jien
I look forward to it	Nistenna li jiġi
Not ready yet.	Għadu mhux lest.
I will always be with you	Jien dejjem se nkun miegħek
I never was, I am or will be otherwise	Qatt ma kont, jien jew se nkun mod ieħor
I was expecting that	Kont qed nistenna dak
But this was not as he expected.	Imma dan ma kienx kif kien jistenna.
I will do that again	Se nerġa' nagħmel dan
And more and more.	U aktar u aktar.
No, you don't.	Le, inti ma.
It's been a while now.	Ilu għal xi żmien issa.
I had to do it myself	Kelli nagħmel jien
I'll wait out here.	Jien ser nistenna hawn barra.
And he’s good with that.	U huwa tajjeb ma 'dak.
I know things you want to know	Naf affarijiet li trid tkun taf
You are what came next.	Int dak li ġie wara.
This can be wrong.	Dan jista 'jkun ħażin.
I have a chance now, to be loved	Għandi ċans issa, li nkun inħobb
I’m still trying to understand this.	Għadni qed nipprova nifhem dan.
I probably won't even be there	Probabbilment lanqas se nkun hemm
Well easier to be.	Ukoll aktar faċli li tkun.
It comes back.	Jiġi lura.
But it has to be.	Imma jrid ikun.
He doesn’t know, and never will.	Ma jafx, u qatt mhu se.
I really wanted to love this book.	Verament ridt inħobb dan il-ktieb.
''.	''.
I need someone.	Għandi bżonn xi ħadd.
I'm pretty good	Jien pjuttost tajjeb
And everything.	U kollox.
I need you to stay with me	Għandi bżonn li toqgħod miegħi
That was pretty hard.	Dak kien pjuttost diffiċli.
He never appeared.	Hu qatt ma deher.
But there was so much, so much.	Imma kien hemm tant, tant.
I’ve always been busy, too busy.	Dejjem kont okkupat, okkupat wisq.
And she did, it seems.	U hi għamlet dan, jidher.
He says he will.	Jgħid li se.
And so does everyone.	U hekk jagħmel kulħadd.
I did a better job.	Għamilt xogħol aħjar.
We had the whole afternoon.	Kellna nofsinhar kollu.
Come to me.	Jiġi għandi.
We were late.	Konna tard.
That looked a lot like that at the time.	Dak deher qisu ħafna dak iż-żmien.
I didn’t know it was coming, either	Ma kontx naf li kien ġej, lanqas
I really couldn't say	Verament ma stajtx ngħid
I can’t do this alone	Ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi
I couldn’t tell what happened next	Ma stajtx ngħid x'ġara wara
I still didn’t even have a car.	Għadni lanqas biss kelli karozza.
This also helps.	Dan jgħin ukoll.
But it hadn’t happened.	Imma ma kienx ġara.
I may still be around	I jista 'jkun għadu madwar
It has to be good for something.	Għandu jkun tajjeb għal xi ħaġa.
I did something for you	Għamilt xi ħaġa għalik
I know something is going on	Naf li qed jiġri xi ħaġa
He’s not there, either.	Hu mhux hemm, lanqas.
Just a thing.	Biss ħaġa.
When you think about it, maybe he is.	Meta taħseb, forsi hu.
We did nothing.	Aħna ma għamilna xejn.
I actually enjoy going now.	Fil-fatt nieħu gost immur issa.
Just you, and another person if you will.	Int biss, u persuna oħra jekk tixtieq.
I know about these things	Naf dwar dawn l-affarijiet
I wasn’t going to tell you	Jien ma kontx se ngħidlek
He said no, it was good.	Qal li le, kien tajjeb.
I was thinking the same thing	Kont qed naħseb ukoll l-istess
And it's a beautiful thing.	U hija ħaġa sabiħa.
He doesn't even know where they are.	Lanqas ma jaf fejn huma.
I love everything there	Inħobb kollox hemm
I hope he was right	Jien nittama li kellu raġun
I can’t tell you much more right now	Ma nistax ngħidlek ħafna aktar bħalissa
Now he seems to be here.	Issa jidher li qiegħed hawn.
She wants everyone to know that you can do it.	Hija trid li kulħadd ikun jaf li inti tista 'tagħmel dan.
I just want that	Irrid biss dik
As it would be.	Kif ikun.
They definitely felt better.	Żgur li ħassu aħjar.
I had done this before.	Jien kont għamilt dan qabel.
I had to be there.	I kellha tkun hemm.
I don’t think so	Jien ma naħseb hekk
That should be easier said than done.	Li għandu jkun aktar faċli milli jidher.
I can’t believe this is my home	Ma nistax nemmen li din hija d-dar tiegħi
Not easy at work.	Mhux faċli fuq ix-xogħol.
I’m so glad I didn’t have to try	Jien kuntent ħafna li ma kellix għalfejn nipprova
I am doing a lot of time.	Qed nagħmel ħafna ħin.
I just know who he is	Naf biss min hu
I still very much hope we were.	Għadni nittama ħafna li konna.
He is very interested.	Huwa interessat ħafna.
A man wants to play.	Raġel irid jilgħab.
And there are other things we can do.	U hemm affarijiet oħra li nistgħu nagħmlu.
I didn’t believe he would come to this	Ma kontx nemmen li se jasal għal dan
I was not ready to do it again	Ma kontx lest li nerġa’ nagħmel
He was good, but you were better.	Hu kien tajjeb, imma int kont aħjar.
I knew you	Kont naf li inti
And it won't.	U mhux se.
I knew you didn't want to either	Jien kont naf li lanqas int ma ridtx
It wasn’t always.	Mhux dejjem kien.
I know something we can do	Naf xi ħaġa li nistgħu nagħmlu
This is good.	Dan huwa tajjeb.
I didn’t want to hope	Ma ridtx nittama
Sure, it should be.	Żgur, dan għandu jkun.
Not for you and not for anyone.	Mhux għalik u mhux għal ħadd.
He could barely see.	Ma tantx seta’ jara.
Probably will, too.	Probabbilment se, ukoll.
I think this could be the problem.	Naħseb li din tista' tkun il-problema.
Maybe someday when that was all.	Forsi xi darba meta dan kien kollu.
That should be enough	Għandu jkun biżżejjed
I am not a child anymore	M'iniex tifel aktar
I’m happy about that.	Jien kuntent dwar dan.
He just sat down.	Huwa biss poġġa bilqiegħda.
I didn’t even know he had been here for a while	Lanqas kont naf li kien hawn għal xi żmien
It was too easy for him to get to me.	Kien faċli wisq għalih li jasal għandi.
I don't want to.	Ma rridx.
It had been a long time since anyone had been there.	Kien ilu ma kien hemm ħadd hemm.
That definitely came before.	Li żgur ġie qabel.
You said it all.	Inti għidt kollox.
Can you tell me.	Tista’ tgħidli.
So it was, sure enough.	Hekk kien, żgur biżżejjed.
I think you are talking to me	Naħseb li qed titkellem miegħi
You have to say something about it.	Trid tgħid xi ħaġa dwarha.
I didn’t tell anyone	Jien ma għedt lil ħadd
I never was too	Jien qatt kont ukoll
You'll see why soon.	Int ser tara għaliex dalwaqt.
Someone has to go home first.	Xi ħadd irid imur id-dar l-ewwel.
He did what he was supposed to do.	Huwa għamel dak li suppost kellu jagħmel.
I won't.	Jien mhux se.
I never say anything either	Jien qatt ma ngħid xejn lanqas
I think it's for sure	Naħseb li huwa ċert
Everyone talks about how it’s done.	Kulħadd jitkellem dwar kif isir.
More next week.	Aktar il-ġimgħa d-dieħla.
Too late.	Tard wisq.
And nothing seems to work.	U xejn jidher li jaħdem.
I haven’t heard anything about it	Jien ma smajt xejn dwarha
I’ve done this before.	Jien għamilt dan qabel.
You know the truth.	Inti taf il-verità.
I will not be the last	Jien mhux se nkun l-aħħar
But she says nothing.	Imma hi ma tgħid xejn.
Once with a man like that	Darba ma’ raġel bħal dan
I had the same problems that everyone else has	Kelli l-istess problemi li għandu kulħadd
But that's what it is	Imma huwa dak li hu
We are much more now.	Aħna ħafna aktar issa.
So are you.	Hekk int.
I could understand how this happened	Stajt nifhem kif ġara dan
I never thought about it that way.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha hekk.
I hope it never comes back	Nittama li qatt ma tiġi lura
I wasn’t expecting anything more!	Jien ma kont nistenna xejn aktar!
I had never thought of it before	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha qabel
With the latter, no problem.	Ma 'l-aħħar, l-ebda problema.
One does not need this.	Wieħed m'għandux bżonn dan.
Not a bad man.	Mhux raġel ħażin.
He took things easy.	Ħa l-affarijiet faċli.
That's just me.	Dak jien biss.
I want us to be friends	Nixtieq li nkunu ħbieb
I would say the only one	Jien ngħid l-unika waħda
That's a lot.	Dak huwa ħafna.
Here’s another way to think about it.	Hawn mod ieħor kif taħseb dwarha.
I wanted to know how it was	Ridt inkun naf kif kien
I’m also for this.	Jien ukoll għal dan.
Taking on this job was harder than any of that.	Li tieħu dan ix-xogħol kien aktar diffiċli minn kull wieħed minn hekk.
Obviously she knew.	Ovvjament kienet taf.
I could tell it was coming a long time ago	Stajt ngħidlek li kien ġej twil ilu
He knew, without thinking, what had happened.	Kien jaf, mingħajr ma ħaseb, x’kien ġara.
I had to talk to him about something	Kelli nitkellem miegħu dwar xi ħaġa
It wasn't just me.	Ma kontx jien biss.
I was just a kid.	Kont biss tifel.
I wish everyone started from a young age	Nixtieq li kulħadd beda minn meta kien żgħir
I had had enough of all that.	Kelli biżżejjed minn dak kollu.
I hope that was all it was	Jien nittama li kien dak kollu li kien
I will do everything.	Jien ser nagħmel kollox.
I didn’t know how much we did that	Ma kontx naf kemm għamilna hekk
I'm yours as much as you are mine	Jien tiegħek daqskemm int tiegħi
He was happy with that.	Kien kuntent b’dan.
But not for very long.	Imma mhux għal żmien twil ħafna.
He didn’t have to think about it.	Ma kellux għalfejn jaħseb dwarha.
Where is it ?.	Fejn hu?.
It seems to be the same.	Jidher li huwa l-istess.
I went to see myself	Mort nara jien
I hope not but who knows	Nittama li ma jkunx imma min jaf
No one was doing this here.	Ħadd ma kien jagħmel dan hawn.
I would be scared of him there.	Inkun nibża miegħu hemmhekk.
She is beautiful.	Hija sabiħa.
I couldn't believe it	Ma stajtx nemmen
I just thought you might want to know	Ħsibt biss li forsi trid tkun taf
He is not a single man.	Mhuwiex raġel wieħed.
I don’t have to worry.	M'għandix għalfejn inkun inkwetat.
But that’s just it.	Imma dak li hu biss.
I hear they are so	Nisma li huma tant
It won't.	Mhux se.
We are better than that.	Aħna aħjar minn hekk.
I knew that now	Jien kont naf li issa
She knew what was going on.	Kienet taf x’kien qed jiġri.
Or it may not be.	Jew jista 'ma jkunx.
He wants to talk to you about it.	Irid jitkellem miegħek dwarha.
This never happened to me.	Dan qatt ma ġara lili.
I have already said this.	Diġà għedt dan.
You can't come here.	Ma tistax tiġi hawn.
But we have what we have.	Imma għandna dak li għandna.
I couldn't tell where he was coming from	Ma stajtx ngħid minn fejn kien ġej
I thought about it a long time ago	Ħsibt dwar dan twil ilu
I was sure of that	Jien kont ċert minn dan
I need to know this.	Għandi bżonn li tkun taf dan.
I had no job	Jien ma kelli l-ebda xogħol
That was over three years ago.	Dan kien aktar minn tliet snin ilu.
I have nothing more to say to you	M'għandi xejn aktar xi ngħidlek
I know what you are planning	Naf x'qed jippjana
But there was something else.	Imma kien hemm ħaġa oħra.
I couldn’t wait much longer	Ma stajtx noqgħod lura ħafna aktar
It was just as you say.	Kien eżatt kif tgħid.
I never wanted to go back.	Qatt ma ridt immur lura.
He went through a lot	Għadda minn ħafna
I wanted more than that	Ridt aktar minn hekk
Account.	Kont.
But he did not know.	Imma ma kienx jaf.
Nothing was done.	Ma sar xejn.
I could say no	Stajt ngħid le
I think everyone has so it can’t be	Naħseb li kulħadd għandu hekk ma jistax ikun
That was good with him.	Dak kien tajjeb miegħu.
I'm still in school in the morning	Għadni l-iskola filgħodu
I think it’s very, very likely.	Naħseb li huwa probabbli ħafna, ħafna.
Not bad.	Mhux ħażin.
Or something like that.	Jew xi ħaġa bħal dik.
The car.	Il-karozza.
Very bad thing.	Ħaġa ħażina ħafna.
I knew something was wrong	Kont naf li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina ħafna
But it was not so.	Imma ma kienx hekk.
This is good, very good.	Dan huwa tajjeb, tajjeb ħafna.
He can’t be a happy man.	Ma jistax ikun raġel ferħan.
That would be something.	Dik tkun xi ħaġa.
I did so.	Jien hekk għamilt.
I know it’s hard	Naf li huwa diffiċli
I was loving it	Kont qed inħobb
I hadn’t even thought about it	Jien lanqas biss kont ħsibt dwar dan
She never did anything wrong to anyone.	Qatt ma għamlet xejn ħażin lil ħadd.
I just know you don’t	Naf biss li m'għandekx
It never happened.	Qatt ma ġara.
I would be right here with you.	Jien inkun eżatt hawn miegħek.
I should be enough for you	Għandi nkun biżżejjed għalik
He was too busy and glad to know he was happy.	Kien wisq okkupat u ferħan li jkun jaf li kien kuntent.
I was so glad.	Kont tant ferħan.
We do so, he went.	Aħna nagħmlu hekk, huwa mar.
He was a man.	Kien raġel.
There was little.	Kien hemm ftit.
But nothing seems to help.	Imma xejn ma jidher li jgħin.
You sure know who he was.	Int żgur li taf min kien.
You don't even think it was over.	Inti lanqas biss taħseb li kien fuq.
I wasn’t sure where.	Ma kontx ċert fejn.
Definitely wanted.	Żgur li ridt.
I really think it will	Verament naħseb li se
I wasn’t taking a chance	Jien ma kont qed nieħu ċans
I hope you came today.	Jien nittama li ġejt illum.
And most of all fun to watch.	U fuq kollox gost tara.
Definitely did.	Żgur li għamlet.
I didn’t want to know, ever	Ma ridtx li jkun jaf, qatt
Just didn’t look good.	Biss ma deherx tajjeb.
He said he was not.	Qal li ma kienx.
I can’t tell you much about it	Ma nistax ngħidlek ħafna dwarha
That’s not what I want.	Li mhux dak li rrid.
Little of everything and nothing	Ftit minn kollox u xejn
He was a person.	Kien persuna.
To think.	Biex taħseb.
I was happy not to say anything	Kont kuntent li ma ngħid xejn
I was happy with that	Kont kuntent b'dan
I’m happy to wait	Jien kuntent li nistenna
And no, you can't.	U le, tista’ ma.
I didn’t want to talk anymore	Ma ridtx nitkellem aktar
I knew one would come	Kont naf li wieħed se jiġi
But it is a very difficult time.	Imma huwa żmien diffiċli ħafna.
He says what is his is mine.	Jgħid dak li hu tiegħu huwa tiegħi.
I could only hope it was all for naught	Stajt nittama biss li kien kollu għal xejn
But you know someone.	Imma taf lil xi ħadd.
But really nothing more.	Imma verament xejn aktar.
You say more or less what I said.	Tgħid xi ftit jew wisq dak li għidt.
I can’t talk about that now	Ma nistax nitkellem dwar dan issa
I knew all about it	Jien kont naf b’dan kollu
I’m willing to take it all in stride	Jien lest li nieħu dan kollu
Definitely there was.	Żgur li kien hemm.
You know it will.	Inti taf li se.
I knew what was going on here	Kont naf x’kien qed jiġri hawn
He’s right, of course.	Huwa għandu raġun, ovvjament.
I'm really not a very nice person.	Jien verament mhux persuna sabiħa ħafna.
I couldn't but that was his problem, not mine	Ma stajtx imma dik kienet il-problema tiegħu, mhux tiegħi
And probably another after that.	U probabbilment ieħor wara dak.
It has been ready for some time.	Ilu lest għal xi żmien.
That had to help.	Dak kellu jgħin.
I’m going to do all these things	Jien se nagħmel dawn l-affarijiet kollha
I had to be with you	I kellha tkun miegħek
I think it could be something better.	Naħseb li tista 'tkun xi ħaġa aħjar.
That was going to be wrong.	Dan kien se jkun ħażin.
I was doing something for him.	Jien kont nagħmel xi ħaġa għalih.
I don’t know why anyone would want this job.	Ma nafx għalfejn xi ħadd ikun irid dan ix-xogħol.
I wish I was almost there	Nixtieq kważi kien hemm
That was some time ago.	Dak kien xi żmien ilu.
You don't, either.	Inti ma, lanqas.
I was never too sure about that.	Qatt ma kien wisq ċert dwar dan.
We had a lot of time, more and more.	Kellna ħafna ħin, aktar u aktar.
I knew she had to be there	Kont naf li kellha tkun hemm
I always knew exactly where he was	Dejjem kont naf eżatt fejn kien
I’m very happy about that.	Jien kuntent ħafna dwar dan.
I really think you want to talk to someone	Verament naħseb li trid titkellem ma' xi ħadd
It should be over now.	Għandu jkun hemm fuq issa.
They make you on something you don't want to be.	Huma jagħmlu inti fuq xi ħaġa li ma tridx tkun.
You have it now.	Inti għandek issa.
I just didn't believe it at the time	I biss ma nemmen li dak iż-żmien
I need to talk to him	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħu
I can do that, he thought	Kapaċi nagħmel dan, ħaseb
I'm not that.	Jien mhux dak.
She says she's not here.	Hi tgħid li mhux hawn.
I shouldn’t ask.	M'għandix nistaqsi.
Or he may have both.	Jew jista’ jkollu t-tnejn.
It's easy to see.	Huwa faċli biex tara.
I don’t know if it’s actually.	Ma nafx jekk fil-fatt hux.
We seem to be doing well.	Jidher li nagħmlu tajjeb.
I’m so glad we did.	Jien ferħan ħafna li għamilna.
I can’t believe you did something like this to me	Ma nistax nemmen li għamilt xi ħaġa bħal din għalija
I can't do it anymore.	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar.
She had a great time.	Kellha ħafna ħin.
I didn’t want to think about it now	Ma ridtx naħseb dwar dan issa
This makes things very easy.	Dan jagħmel l-affarijiet faċli ħafna.
I often say things without thinking	Spiss ngħid affarijiet mingħajr ma naħseb
I can wait now.	Nista' nistenna issa.
I'll tell you where she is	Jien ngħidlek fejn hi
Tomorrow before noon.	Għada qabel nofsinhar.
I think tired of knowing too much.	Naħseb li għajjien li jkun jaf wisq.
I had a son, a little boy	Kelli tifel, tifel żgħir
I have never seen anything like it	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din
This was not easy.	Dan ma kienx faċli.
So much.	Tant.
I can’t believe you do all this	Ma nistax nemmen li tagħmel dan kollu
It is a really difficult time.	Huwa żmien tassew diffiċli.
I see you doing this all the time	Nara inti tagħmel dan il-ħin kollu
It is very difficult to speak at present.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna li titkellem bħalissa.
I didn't want to either	Lanqas jien ma ridtx
No one is helpful.	L-ebda waħda hija ta' għajnuna.
I won't even tell you	Lanqas se ngħidlek
I am here with you	Jiena li qiegħed hawn miegħek
Well, that’s the same thing.	Ukoll, din hija l-istess ħaġa.
Neither is she.	Lanqas hi.
I always, always have, always will	Jien dejjem, dejjem għandi, dejjem se
That he wouldn’t do.	Dan ma kienx jagħmel.
But you are right about one thing.	Imma għandek raġun dwar ħaġa waħda.
I have a little idea about something more	Għandi ftit idea dwar xi ħaġa aktar
Before you are good, you must be bad.	Qabel ma tkun tajjeb, trid tkun ħażin.
I didn't even have to say anything	Lanqas kelli għalfejn ngħid xejn
Glad he made it home.	Ferħan li għamel id-dar.
I was sure there was something there	Jien kont ċert li kien hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk
That’s a nice thing to think about.	Dik hija ħaġa sabiħa li taħseb.
You know what it is.	Inti taf x'inhu.
She won’t tell me why she’s here.	Hi mhux se tgħidli għaliex hi hawn.
Like a good boy.	Bħal tifel tajjeb.
I wonder who is willing to do that	Nistaqsi min hu lest li jagħmel dan
I wonder a lot about it.	Nistaqsi ħafna dwarha.
I had no idea about that.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea dwar dan.
He could not be here.	Ma setax ikun hawn.
I want to talk to you about this	Irrid nitkellem miegħek dwar dan
But it was his, as a whole.	Imma kien tiegħu, kollu kemm hu.
But today and only today.	Imma llum u llum biss.
I think he didn’t have to go	Naħseb li ma kellux għalfejn imur
I am so worried about it	Jiena tant inkwetat dwarha
It has recently become apparent that I need to do this more often	Dan l-aħħar deher li għandi bżonn nagħmel dan aktar spiss
If she wasn’t there, she had a problem.	Jekk hi ma kinitx hemm, kellu problema.
It started, but it felt better.	Beda, imma ħassu aħjar.
But he speaks well.	Imma hu jitkellem tajjeb.
I didn’t have to like that	Jien ma kellix inħobb dan
I want to do it again	Irrid nerġa' nagħmel
And now it's too late	U issa jista’ jkun tard wisq
Sorry you had to see this	Jiddispjaċini li kellek tara dan
I never wanted it to be that way	Qatt ma ridt li jkun hekk
I know exactly who you are	Naf eżatt min int
There is nothing about it.	M'hemm xejn dwar dan.
But who else.	Imma min aktar.
All the same, he knew he was there.	L-istess, kien jaf li kien hemm.
I really didn't know why	Verament ma kontx naf għaliex
They were almost there.	Kienu kważi hemm.
I didn’t have to, maybe not tonight	Ma kontx ikolli, forsi mhux illejla
I did really wrong	Għamilt tassew ħażin
I may be surprised you	I jista 'jkun sorpriż inti
I can't see anything outside	Ma nistax nara xi ħaġa barra
He had seen too much.	Huwa kien ra wisq.
I need another, and another and another.	Għandi bżonn ieħor, u ieħor u ieħor.
I was a really bad boy	Jien kont tifel tassew ħażin
For quite some time.	Għal xi żmien mhux ħażin.
I didn't think much of it	Ma tantx ħsibt xejn minn dan
It was easy to see why.	Kien faċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
He is a good man.	Huwa raġel tajjeb.
That was it.	Dak kien.
If you do so.	Jekk tagħmel hekk.
And so he did.	U hekk għamel.
It wasn’t long enough.	Ma kienx twil biżżejjed.
It's something like that.	Hija xi ħaġa bħal din.
Now you know everyone there.	Issa taf lil kulħadd hemm.
It looked like he was going to survive.	Deher li kien se jgħix.
I haven't for a while	M'għandix għal xi żmien
This is long enough !.	Dan huwa twil biżżejjed!.
As always.	Bħal għal dejjem.
I hope it’s right for you	Nispera li hu tajjeb għalik
I wonder what he is thinking	Nistaqsi x’qed jaħseb
But now he was here.	Imma issa kien hawn.
He did so.	Hekk għamel.
I didn’t know what to do with myself	Ma kontx naf x'se nagħmel minni
I know that now more than ever	Naf li issa aktar minn qatt qabel
He doesn’t like talking to me about work.	Ma jħobbx jitkellem miegħi dwar ix-xogħol.
As you know.	Kif kienet taf.
This is wrong.	Dan huwa ħażin.
There would be something.	Ikun hemm xi ħaġa.
I think she's just tired	Naħseb li hija biss għajjien
I really like how it looks	Jien inħobb ħafna kif tidher
I will not be able to do this from here	Mhux se nkun kapaċi nagħmel dan minn hawn
That wasn't long.	Li ma kienx twil.
I think he already knew	Naħseb li diġà kien jaf
I think he was doing it again	Naħseb li kien qed jagħmel dan mill-ġdid
It doesn't look the same here.	Mhux jidher l-istess hawn.
Also, it's too late.	Barra minn hekk, huwa tard wisq.
Which maybe it was.	Li forsi kien.
Surely he knew this.	Żgur li kien jaf dan.
I just thought about it	Għadni kemm ħsibt dwarha
I’m sure you are too.	Jien ċert li int ukoll.
He said he was busy.	Qal li kien okkupat.
You can tell.	Inti tista 'tgħid.
I want more than that	Nixtieq aktar minn hekk
And it wasn’t so bad.	U ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
I was nothing	Jien ma kont jiena xejn
I never knew there was so much.	Qatt ma kont naf li kien hemm daqshekk.
I know it looks bad	Naf li jidher ħażin
I think it will take that	Naħseb li se jieħu dan
And we have.	U għandna.
A very long time ago	Żmien twil ħafna ilu
It's too bad.	Huwa ħażin wisq.
That's just us.	Dak biss aħna.
It should appear.	Għandu jidher.
For someone to come.	Biex xi ħadd jiġi.
This is definitely better than doing nothing.	Dan żgur huwa aħjar milli ma tagħmel xejn.
Kellha.	Kellha.
Now he had a chance to think.	Issa kellu ċans jaħseb.
It does more.	Jagħmel aktar.
I can tell you for sure	Nista’ ngħidlek dan żgur
I never had any children.	Qatt ma kelli l-ebda tifel.
Well, no problem.	Ukoll, l-ebda problema.
Think about it.	Ħaseb dwarha.
I don't understand anything	Jien ma nifhem xejn
I have more to say.	Għandi aktar xi ngħid.
They are my friends.	Huma ħbieb tiegħi.
But on another job.	Imma fuq xogħol ieħor.
Neither do I.	Jien lanqas.
No one else would.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien se.
If you think this in advance.	Jekk taħseb dan minn qabel.
There was one car.	Kien hemm karozza waħda.
It was here, she knew.	Kien hawn, kienet taf.
I hope he has for you	Nispera li għandu għalik
I never said enough	Qatt ma għedt biżżejjed
I just took a chance.	I biss ħa ċans.
In fact they were there.	Fil-fatt kienu hemm.
Just a few years.	Ftit snin biss.
I think it could be anything	Naħseb li jista 'jkun xi ħaġa
I just need to talk to him	Għandi biss bżonn nitkellem miegħu
I thought maybe she was tired	Ħsibt li forsi tkun għajjien
I just don’t know what to say you know.	Jien biss ma nafx dak li tgħid li taf.
He saw nothing.	Ma ra xejn.
I saw what happened	Rajt x’ġara
The problem is that it has never been above before.	Il-problema hija li qatt ma kien hawn fuq qabel.
I wanted to make one for a while.	Jien ridt nagħmel waħda għal xi żmien.
And now that has to happen.	U issa dan irid jiġri.
I can't understand you	Ma nistax nifhem int
Everything went too fast for me	Kollox mar malajr wisq għalija
He obviously did.	Huwa ovvjament għamel.
And it was too much for him.	U kien wisq għalih.
It was never just the two of them.	Qatt ma kien it-tnejn biss.
That's all something.	Dak kollu xi ħaġa.
John sits outside.	John joqgħod barra.
But there was something else out there as well.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra hemmhekk ukoll.
I understand that now	Nifhem li issa
I'm very happy to hear that	Jien kuntent ħafna li nisma' dan
This is what you want.	Dan huwa dak li trid.
That was for sure.	Dak kien ċert.
Just a little.	Ftit biss .
There must be another way.	Għandu jkun hemm mod ieħor.
I think we have a problem	Naħseb li għandna problema
That’s not something you will know.	Dik mhix xi ħaġa li se tkun taf.
I had passed.	Kont għadda.
After that, nothing.	Wara dan, xejn.
I have been for a little over a year.	Ilni għal ftit aktar minn sena.
And it's working.	U qed jaħdem.
I'm happy either way.	Jien kuntent jew mod.
I never buy anything	Qatt qatt nixtri xi ħaġa
You don’t want to know about it.	Inti ma tridx tkun taf dwar dan.
And they are soon.	U huma dalwaqt.
The door, the front door.	Il-bieb, il-bieb ta’ barra.
I can't see anything else	Ma nistax nara xi ħaġa oħra
Not forever, of course.	Mhux għal dejjem, ovvjament.
But now he knew the truth.	Imma issa kien jaf il-verità.
But still not alone.	Imma għadu mhux biss.
Well, this is home now.	Ukoll, din hija d-dar issa.
This happens from time to time.	Dan jiġri minn żmien għal żmien.
I wish it was, but it’s not	Nixtieq li kien, imma mhux
But enough about what it is.	Imma biżżejjed dwar dak li hu.
I need to try again.	Għandi bżonn nerġa' nipprova.
It was almost one.	Kien kważi wieħed.
That had to be him.	Dan kellu jkun hu.
I was trying things out	Kont qed nipprova l-affarijiet
There may be.	Jista 'jkun hemm.
It's out back.	Huwa barra lura.
I wasn’t expecting that	Jien ma kontx qed nistenna hekk
And he is right.	U għandu raġun.
There is nothing you can do about it.	M'hemm xejn li inti tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
Not even that.	Mhux lanqas dak.
I still want to be with you	Għadni irrid inkun miegħek
I think you should know that	Naħseb li għandek tkun taf li
That’s not a good time.	Dak mhux żmien tajjeb.
I have everything working fine.	Għandi kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
It's so easy.	Huwa daqshekk faċli.
It’s not hard at all.	Mhu diffiċli xejn.
You can think a lot about it.	Inti tista 'taħseb ħafna għal dan.
That is.	Li hu.
It is usually more than enough.	Normalment huwa aktar minn biżżejjed.
I saw it for a while	Rajt għal ftit żmien
It's a bad time.	Huwa żmien ħażin.
We can go now.	Nistgħu mmorru issa.
Not once, but more and more.	Mhux darba, imma aktar u aktar.
I won't tell you again	Mhux se nerġa’ ngħidlek
Nothing to say.	Xejn xi ngħid.
It was home.	Kien id-dar.
They do this often.	Huma jagħmlu dan spiss.
Nothing, of course.	Xejn, ovvjament.
I was happy at work	Jien kont kuntent fuq ix-xogħol
You don't need me.	Inti m'għandekx bżonn lili.
One really bad one.	Waħda ħażina tassew.
Or it takes a long time.	Jew tieħu żmien twil.
I don’t do anything more.	Jien ma nagħmel xejn aktar.
I think it should be good	Naħseb li għandu jkun tajjeb
I know what that is	Naf x'inhu dak
I didn't know what was going on.	Ma kontx naf x’inhu jiġri.
Everything was still.	Kollox kien għadu.
A year is a very long time	Sena hija żmien twil ħafna
Obviously, everything goes with it.	Ovvjament, dak kollu li jmur miegħu.
We knew he was here.	Konna nafu li kien hawn.
But this, it seems, was not enough.	Imma dan, milli jidher, ma kienx biżżejjed.
That was as far as I ever got.	Dak kien sa fejn qatt wasal.
I need that now.	Għandi bżonn li issa.
I was almost too scared to ask	I kien kważi wisq jibża biex nistaqsi
I saw how it was.	Rajt kif kien.
After all I was not alone	Wara kollox ma kontx waħdi
He was supposed to wait for that.	Huwa suppost kellu jistenna li.
I think we are.	Naħseb li aħna.
That works for me.	Li jaħdem għalija.
I'm worried about nothing	Jien inkwetat fuq xejn
No money.	Bla flus.
You don't need to know.	Inti m'għandekx bżonn tkun taf.
There are people like that out there.	Hemm nies hekk hemmhekk.
I couldn't see any way	Ma stajt nara l-ebda mod
She doesn’t like what you see there.	Hija ma jħobbx dak li tara hemmhekk.
Not much more than that.	Mhux wisq aktar minn hekk.
He never arrives.	Hu qatt ma jasal.
I want to do this job.	Irrid nagħmel dan ix-xogħol.
But this.	Imma dan.
It wasn’t really for me.	Ma kienx verament għalija.
That says what it has to say	Li jgħid dak li għandu xi jgħid
I think you have a good idea	Naħseb li għandek idea tajba
That being said, this works well.	Wieħed jgħid, dan jaħdem tajjeb.
But no one is talking about it.	Imma ħadd mhu qed jitkellem dwar dan.
I had done that	Kelli għamilt dan
Everything has to come to this.	Kollox irid jasal għal dan.
It was a matter of time.	Kienet problema ta’ żmien.
I have to be something	Ikolli nkun xi ħaġa
I need the time I think	Għandi bżonn il-ħin naħseb
Also, there is nothing you can do at home.	Barra minn hekk, m'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel id-dar.
There's just me.	Hemm jien biss.
He did three things.	Għamel tliet affarijiet.
You did nothing wrong.	Inti għamilt xejn ħażin.
Here you are, and no one from.	Hawn int, u ħadd minn.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx hekk.
This may or may not be what you want.	Dan jista 'jew ma jistax ikun dak li trid.
I suspect that’s what’s happening	Nissuspetta li dak li qed jiġri
I’ve been here for a while now.	Kont ilni hawn għal xi żmien issa.
I know she will	Naf li hi se
He had no idea what to say.	Ma kellux idea x’għandu jgħid.
You don't do that.	Inti ma tagħmel dan.
He spent a lot of time together.	Għamel ħafna ħin flimkien.
It was just that.	Kien biss dan.
He knew.	Kien jaf.
I wasn’t expecting anything like this	Ma kontx qed nistenna xi ħaġa bħal din
There is probably a good chance he will do so.	Probabbilment hemm ċans tajjeb li jagħmel hekk.
Everyone was too tired.	Kulħadd kien għajjien wisq.
I didn’t want to do that	Ma ridtx nagħmel hekk
Not one thing.	Mhux ħaġa waħda.
I was right.	Jien kont raġun.
How long ago.	Kemm kien ilu.
There was nothing.	Ma kien hemm xejn.
Apparently we had done something we couldn’t.	Jidher li konna għamilna xi ħaġa li ma setax.
Here's me.	Hawn minni.
He came before anything else.	Huwa ġie qabel kull ħaġa oħra.
You know how.	Taf kif jista’ jkun.
I think this will work	Naħseb li dan se jaħdem
I know how much time you have	Naf kemm għandek ħin
He is so alone.	Huwa daqshekk waħdu.
At first I didn’t believe it	L-ewwel ma kontx nemmen
But here it comes.	Imma ġej.
Look where I'm going.	Ħares fejn sejjer.
You do it, and he knows where we are.	Inti tagħmel dan, u hu jaf fejn aħna.
Maybe she should.	Forsi kellha.
I like to do things	Inħobb nagħmel l-affarijiet
I'm really happy.	Jien tassew kuntent.
He had to leave.	Kellu jitlaq.
But it’s not really working.	Imma mhux verament qed jaħdem.
That could have been us.	Dak seta’ konna aħna.
I need to be sure, that’s all	Għandi bżonn inkun ċert, dak kollu
We do something else.	Nagħmlu xi ħaġa oħra.
After all, what goes around comes around.	Wara kollox, dak li jmur madwar jiġi madwar.
There is wrong.	Hemm ħażin.
I know what you are not	Naf dak li m'intix
I hope you know the same	Nispera li taf l-istess
But that will not be enough.	Imma dan mhux se jkun biżżejjed.
I still don’t want to talk about it.	Għadni ma rridx nitkellem dwar dan.
Not that you were really completely alone.	Mhux li int kont verament għal kollox waħdek.
I will not do this again	Dan mhux se nagħmel aktar
I know how to do it.	Naf kif isir.
Everyone wants some.	Kulħadd irid xi ftit.
As far as I know, this should work.	Sa fejn naf jien, dan għandu jaħdem.
It turned out to look really good.	Ħareġ tidher tassew tajba.
It’s not hard to do as you think.	Mhuwiex diffiċli li tagħmel kif taħseb.
He didn't seem to be afraid of anyone.	Ma deher li kien jibża’ minn ħadd.
It was not so much what he had seen as what he had not seen.	Ma kienx daqshekk dak li kien ra daqs dak li ma kienx ra.
I had no idea I was here	Ma kellix idea li kont hawn
I haven’t had so much fun.	Jien ilni ma nieħu gost daqshekk.
I will try to make it work	Se nipprova li dan jaħdem
I heard what you said	Smajt dak li għedt
Outside was one thing.	Barra kienet ħaġa waħda.
I never told anyone	Qatt ma kont għedt lil ħadd
You must.	Int trid.
He doesn’t do the job.	Hu ma jagħmilx ix-xogħol.
I didn’t see anyone or anything	Jien ma rajt lil ħadd jew xejn
It can be difficult to.	Jista 'jkun diffiċli li.
It makes a lot of money.	Jagħmel ħafna flus.
Obviously everyone has something to say.	Ovvjament kulħadd għandu xi jgħid.
I was wondering if this is so	Kont nistaqsi jekk dan hux hekk
Here are just a few.	Hawn huma biss ftit.
But he didn’t.	Imma ma kellux.
He wanted something.	Ried xi ħaġa.
And it will take some time to think about it.	U se jieħu ftit ħin biex jaħseb dwarha.
I just have to believe	Ikolli biss nemmen
You are saying.	Qed tgħid.
I did a good job.	Għamilt xogħol tajjeb.
I had to go home.	Kelli nerġa’ lura d-dar.
Had he not been too tired.	Kieku ma kienx għajjien wisq.
I was really scared now	Issa kont verament nibża’
I couldn’t speak.	Ma stajtx nitkellem.
But someone did.	Imma xi ħadd għamel.
They actually have a lot of money right now.	Fil-fatt għandhom ħafna flus bħalissa.
I still have that problem	Għadni għandi dik il-problema
We both know this.	It-tnejn nafu dan.
He just needed to survive.	Huwa biss kellu bżonn jgħix.
I knew exactly what was coming	Kont naf eżatt x’kien ġej
I can only hope you do too	Nista' biss nittama li int ukoll
I have no idea how to do that	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif jagħmel dan
She knew it wouldn’t be easy.	Kienet taf li mhux se jkun faċli.
No, he's not.	Le, hu mhux.
I did the work.	Jien għamilt ix-xogħol.
I shouldn’t think about it	M'għandix naħseb dwarha
And now we know there is a better way.	U issa nafu li hemm mod aħjar.
He couldn't talk much about anything else.	Ma tantx seta’ jitkellem dwar xi ħaġa oħra.
The truth be told.	Il-verità tkun għid.
I know this is hard for you too	Naf li dan huwa diffiċli għalik ukoll
I need to tell the truth	Għandi bżonn ngħid il-verità
And that you will be.	U li inti tkun.
His or mine.	Tiegħu jew tiegħi.
But there it was, for both of us.	Imma kien hemm, għalina t-tnejn.
I wasn’t happy about it.	Ma kontx kuntent dwar dan.
I think there is a good idea	Naħseb li hemm idea tajba
Now, not so much.	Issa, mhux daqshekk.
I knew he was worried	Kont naf li kien inkwetat
Well, he should be.	Ukoll, huwa għandu jkun.
Time is running out.	Il-ħin lest.
The truth was that he could not leave.	Il-verità kienet li ma setax jitlaq.
It has been here for years.	Ilu hawn snin.
He knew he would never.	Kien jaf li qatt ma kien se.
There is a little more.	Hemm xi ftit aktar.
I don’t know for sure.	Ma nafx ċert.
After that I knew nothing	Wara dan ma kont naf xejn
He is not the first and will not be the last.	Hu mhux l-ewwel u mhux se jkun l-aħħar.
I think it would be	Naħseb li tkun
No job is too big or too small.	L-ebda xogħol mhu kbir wisq jew żgħir wisq.
I can already say what all this is.	Diġà nista' ngħid x'inhu dan kollu.
I knew what was coming next.	Kont naf x’kien ġej wara.
I didn't know what it was	Ma kontx naf x’kien
The truth is not enough.	Il-verità mhix biżżejjed.
First I wanted to talk to you	L-ewwel ridt nitkellem miegħek
I wasn’t sure why.	Ma kienx ċert għaliex.
And he’s great.	U hu kbir.
I love you so much	Jien tant inħobb miegħek
I think you have a problem.	Naħseb li għandek problema.
She knew what had happened.	Kienet taf x’kien ġara.
But it wasn’t for me.	Imma ma kienx għalija.
I couldn't believe it was him	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien hu
I’m not sure about that.	M'inix ċert dwar dan.
I was trying to see what you said	Kont qed nipprova nara dak li qal tiegħek
It takes more time.	Huwa jieħu aktar żmien.
I never told anyone I knew	Qatt ma kont ngħid lil ħadd li taf
There will always be	Dejjem se jkun hemm
But he was ready.	Imma kien lest.
I never know what he will do	Qatt ma naf x’se jagħmel
But we know.	Imma nafu.
For this you are here.	Għal dan qiegħed hawn.
I saw this when I was little.	Dan rajt meta kont żgħir.
I didn’t even know why	Lanqas biss kont naf għaliex
I can just sit there for hours and think	Nista’ noqgħod hemm għal sigħat u naħseb biss
I never even thought about it	Lanqas qatt ma ħsibt dwarha
But it’s a good thing you’re with him today.	Imma hija ħaġa tajba li int miegħu llum.
I really wanted to know	Verament ridt inkun naf
Well, my first one for a very long time.	Ukoll, l-ewwel wieħed tiegħi għal żmien twil ħafna.
I have a great idea now	Għandi idea kbira issa
I had no money	Ma kelli l-ebda flus
It was really a problem.	Kienet tassew problema.
Now, this is not the only way to do it.	Issa, dan mhux l-uniku mod biex tagħmel dan.
It's pretty easy.	Huwa pjuttost faċli.
I believe we can do that	Nemmen li nistgħu nagħmlu dan
I saw what was happening.	Rajt x’kien qed jiġri.
I think it's wrong.	Naħseb li huwa ħażin.
I didn’t think I was interested	Ma kontx naħseb li kont interessat
I was better on my own	Kont aħjar waħdi
I know what I wanted	Naf li dak li ridt
I just thought so	Jiena biss ħsibt dan
I never expected much	Qatt ma kont ħafna li nistenna
He seemed to have.	Huwa deher li kellu.
For someone out of here.	Għal xi ħadd minn barra minn hawn.
I didn’t want anything	Jien ma ridt xejn
I'm doing well now.	Jien issa sejjer tajjeb.
It's yours now.	Huwa tiegħek issa.
I’m looking forward to it, I hope	Qed nistenna hekk, nittama
This is who you are now.	Dan hu min int issa.
This is how it works.	Dan huwa kif jaħdem.
To be able to do that.	Biex tkun tista 'tagħmel dan.
I have not heard or seen anyone	Jien ma smajt jew rajt lil ħadd
I can’t talk much anymore. 	Ma nistax nitkellem ħafna aktar. 
It was good.	Kienet tajba.
And he didn’t want to do that.	U ma riedx jagħmel hekk.
It will be difficult.	Se jkun diffiċli.
Which was good for me.	Li għalija kien tajjeb.
In fact, I couldn't tell	Fil-fatt ma stajtx ngħid
I hadn’t seen this coming	Jien ma kontx rajt dan ġej
We will never know.	Qatt mhu se nkunu nafu.
I think everyone knows	Naħseb li kulħadd jaf
It went well.	Hija mar tajjeb.
I didn’t want this to go away.	Ma ridtx li dan jitlaq.
I thought I would do it	Ħsibt li se tagħmel dan
I used to have a lot of that	Jien kont ikolli ħafna minn dan
She was alone, as before.	Kienet waħedha, bħal qabel.
We are more than that.	Aħna aktar minn hekk.
He was not saying.	Ma kienx jgħid.
He must have.	Huwa għandu jkollu.
I knew there was something to it	Jien kont naf li kien hemm xi ħaġa għal dan
It was work.	Kien xogħol.
In fact, many will never.	Fil-fatt, ħafna qatt ma se.
It’s bad for everyone.	Huwa ħażin għal kulħadd.
I'm me.	Jien jien.
I didn’t listen, but it was hard not to listen.	Ma kontx nisma, imma kien diffiċli li ma nisma.
We have to do it together.	Irridu nagħmlu dan flimkien.
i have fun.	nieħu gost.
You look too good to go to this job.	Inti tidher wisq tajba biex tmur għal dan ix-xogħol.
And now it has happened.	U issa ġara.
I didn’t want to talk to him	Ma ridtx nitkellem miegħu
It was good.	Kien tajjeb.
I knew why he had done that	Kont naf għaliex kien għamel hekk
I'm also interested in why	Jien interessat ukoll għaliex
Or so he thought it was his time.	Jew hekk ħaseb li kien iż-żmien tiegħu.
I wasn’t me.	Jien ma kontx jien.
I really shouldn’t say that.	Verament m'għandix ngħid dan.
He would know when it was time.	Kien ikun jaf meta jkun il-ħin.
She doesn't want to.	Hi ma tridx.
I've been going there	Stajt immur hemm
I haven’t heard anything say otherwise.	Ma smajt xejn jgħid mod ieħor.
I think you never know	Naħseb li qatt ma tkun taf
This he did not want.	Dan ma kienx ried.
I knew she was going to look beautiful	Kont naf li kienet se tidher sabiħa
She will be home soon.	Hija se tiġi d-dar dalwaqt.
I didn’t know she had one	Ma kontx naf li kellha waħda
But not much help.	Imma mhux ħafna għajnuna.
What happened next, happened to me.	Dak li ġara wara, ġara lili.
I had to go home	Kelli nerġa’ lura d-dar
I always went home alone	Dejjem mort id-dar waħdi
It has to be something.	Irid ikun xi ħaġa.
I have other things for you	Għandi affarijiet oħra għalik
Not so good either.	Mhux daqshekk tajjeb lanqas.
But she didn't.	Imma hi ma.
It's long.	Huwa twil.
I’m not sure how we’re going to do that.	M'inix ċert kif se nagħmlu dan.
I know what's going on here	Naf x'qed jiġri hawn
It should be getting better.	Għandu jkun sejjer aħjar.
I was making it hard again, already	Jien kont qed nerġa' nagħmel diffiċli, diġà
He can't help anyone right now.	Ma jista’ jgħin lil ħadd bħalissa.
I thought it was him	Jien kont naħseb li kien hu
We will do that.	Aħna ser nagħmlu dan.
They were.	Kienu.
You moved a lot.	Int mort ħafna.
It has never happened before.	Qatt ma ġara hekk qabel.
I hadn’t seen one many times at all	Jien ma kont rajt waħda ħafna drabi xejn
I did this and it works.	Għamilt dan u jaħdem.
No one was doing that.	Ħadd ma kien jagħmel hekk.
What you say goes.	Dak li tgħid imur.
Well, it's not.	Ukoll, mhuwiex.
He came on.	Huwa daħal fuq.
Maybe you’d like to sit down with us and talk about it.	Forsi tixtieq toqgħod bilqiegħda magħna u titkellem dwarha.
I thought it would look small forever	Ħsibt li se jidher żgħir għal dejjem
I still can't understand	Għadni ma nistax nifhem
Sorry it has to be done.	Jiddispjaċini li jrid isir.
That’s not what we do.	Dak mhux dak li nagħmlu.
After all, it had happened once before.	Wara kollox, kien ġara darba qabel.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Mhux l-ewwel darba li ġara dan.
But that will have to wait until tomorrow, he thought.	Imma dak se jkollu jistenna sa għada, ħaseb.
And that's someone we are.	U dak xi ħadd aħna.
I know no one else knew about it	Naf li ħadd ieħor ma kien jaf dwar dan
There should be some of this as well.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ftit minn dan ukoll.
After that, it’s pretty easy.	Wara dan, huwa pjuttost faċli.
I hope you are well.	Nispera li int tajjeb.
All of the above.	Kollha ta 'hawn fuq.
I love what they do.	Inħobb dak li jagħmlu.
Here's what you have.	Hawn dak li għandek.
I actually didn’t know.	Fil-fatt ma kontx naf.
I have a husband.	Għandi raġel.
There are such things.	Hemm affarijiet bħal dawn.
I really believe in the following.	Verament nemmen li ġej.
I’ve been taking a lot of this lately	Kont qed nieħu ħafna minn dan dan l-aħħar
I think you are who you are	Naħseb li int min int
That should be enough.	Għandu jkun biżżejjed.
He didn't know.	Ma kellux jaf.
He may never know.	Jista’ qatt ma jkun jaf.
I just want everyone to get to know each other	Irrid biss li kulħadd isir jaf lil xulxin
It took a while.	Ħa ftit.
It is good or bad.	Huwa tajjeb jew ħażin.
But then.	Imma dak iż-żmien.
It was really happening.	Kien verament jiġri.
It's not happening.	Mhux qed jiġri.
I will stay here and talk to you	Jien se noqgħod hawn u nitkellem miegħek
That remains.	Li jibqa.
And you want to know what will happen next.	U trid tkun taf x'se jiġri wara.
They are.	Huma.
There is good, and there is bad.	Hemm tajjeb, u hemm ħażin.
Nothing like this happened.	Ma ġara xejn bħal dan.
I think that’s what we’re going to do	Naħseb li dak li se nagħmlu huwa dan
I had no one else	Ma kelli lil ħadd aktar
I know it will be soon	Naf li se jkun dalwaqt
This problem is more difficult than it first appears.	Din il-problema hija aktar diffiċli milli tidher l-ewwel.
I used to do that.	Jien kont nagħmel hekk.
And these.	U dawn.
I’m not the only one surprised by this	M'iniex l-uniku sorpriż b'dan
I have had this problem lately	Għandi din il-problema dan l-aħħar
I never thought about it at the time.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha dak iż-żmien.
The time for this has passed.	Iż-żmien għal dan għadda.
I can do things for you	Nista' nagħmel affarijiet għalik
He was my friend, after all.	Huwa kien ħabib tiegħi, wara kollox.
It was working well at the time.	Dak iż-żmien kien qed jaħdem tajjeb.
Now everyone has done many other things	Issa kulħadd għamel ħafna affarijiet oħra
He had never seen this before.	Hu qatt ma kien ra dan qabel.
Unless you can't do without.	Sakemm ma tistax tagħmel mingħajr.
For a while.	Għal ftit żmien.
I didn’t have long, just a few years	Ma kellix twil, ftit snin biss
Surely he was right.	Żgur li kellu raġun.
I'm really sorry about that	Jien tassew jiddispjaċini għal dan
These are for you.	Dawn huma għalik.
I want to know better	Irrid inkun naf aħjar
It happened often.	Ġara spiss.
I know you know that	Naf li taf li
I had to be that something	Kelli nkun dik xi ħaġa
He looked at.	Huwa ħares lejn.
There was just too much time.	Kien hemm ftit wisq ħin.
I think you will be happy	Naħseb li tkun kuntent
Everyone.	Kulħadd.
I need to go to school first	L-ewwel għandi bżonn immur l-iskola
For take and take and take	Għal jieħu u jieħu u jieħu
I have to think about what I said	Ikolli naħseb dwar dak li għedt
Now it seems to be working well.	Issa jidher li qed jaħdem tajjeb.
You will like this one.	Inti ser bħal dan wieħed.
It didn’t have to work.	Ma kellux għalfejn jaħdem.
Everything was as it was.	Dak kollu kien kif kien.
I never was, not really	Qatt ma kont, mhux verament
I didn’t know he was back	Ma kontx naf li kien lura
I will have to do this faster	Ikolli nagħmel aktar malajr dwar dan
I'm not doing that	Jien mhux qed nagħmel hekk
But it could not last forever.	Imma ma setax jibqa’ għal dejjem.
I've done that	Jien stajt għamilt hekk
I wish you were here with me	Nixtieq li inti kont hawn miegħi
He said he was going to go, but he never went.	Qal li kien se jmur, imma qatt ma mar.
I'm tired now.	Jien issa għajjien.
And of course he wants to have it back.	U ovvjament irid ikollu lura.
I still can’t see why you want to do this.	Għadni ma nistax nara għaliex trid tagħmel dan.
It was ready.	Kien lest.
We can do that.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
So did I.	Hekk għamilt ukoll.
That’s not my problem.	Dik mhix il-problema tiegħi.
I wasn't expecting anything	Ma kont qed nistenna xejn
I just didn’t want to say anything	Jien biss ma ridt ngħid xejn
I often loved it.	Ħafna drabi kont inħobb.
Why would they do that? 	Għaliex kieku jagħmlu hekk?
he asked.	staqsa.
I’m sorry to say something now	Jiddispjaċini li ngħid xi ħaġa issa
It is much better than nothing.	Huwa ħafna aħjar minn xejn.
I will not do that.	Jien mhux se nagħmel dan.
I can't seem to figure out how to do it.	Jidher li ma nistax nifhem kif nagħmel dan.
They often do.	Ħafna drabi jagħmlu.
Like what I do in my room.	Bħal dak li nagħmel fil-kamra tiegħi.
I need to know exactly where he is	Għandi bżonn inkun naf eżatt fejn hu
It seems to be going well.	Jidher li sejjer tajjeb.
Again.	Mill-ġdid.
To put things in perspective.	Biex titkellem l-affarijiet.
I know what’s ready for me.	Naf x'hemm lest għalija.
I saw what you are capable of	Rajt dak li inti kapaċi
I have seen this happen many times.	Rajt dan jiġri ħafna drabi.
I can see it's still there	Nista' nara li għadu
I think you are right.	Naħseb li għandek raġun.
His work was no better.	Ix-xogħol tiegħu ma kienx aħjar.
I’ve never done that just once.	Jien qatt għamilt hekk darba biss.
I can see why you did that	Nista’ nara għaliex għamilt dan
I'll see you again.	Se nerġa' nara.
No one was there.	Ħadd ma kien hemm.
I know this has not been easy for you	Naf li dan ma kienx faċli għalik
No one wants that.	Ħadd ma jkun irid hekk.
I just want to be me	Irrid inkun biss jien
I took it way too.	I ħa fuq mod wisq.
I have to say something	Għandi ngħid xi ħaġa
I just wanted everything to go	Ridt biss li kollox imur
I didn't want to talk	Ma ridtx nitkellem
He has problems.	Għandu problemi.
Everyone said no.	Kulħadd qal le.
I was glad he was still living there	Kont ferħan li kien għadu jgħix hemm
I’m not sure how he got there.	M'inix ċert kif wasal hemm.
Same with.	L-istess ma.
Maybe tomorrow this house will be mine.	Forsi għada din id-dar tkun tiegħi.
I knew it wasn’t going to happen	Kont naf li mhux se jiġri
I’ve been talking about something.	Jien stajt nitkellem fuq xi ħaġa.
I have been eating well	Ilni niekol tajjeb
I'm sure there were some problems	Jiena ċert li kien hemm xi problemi
And you have too.	U għandek ukoll.
He doesn’t want to think.	Ma jridx jaħseb.
I would be everything to you	Jien inkun kollox għalik
I want to be happy.	Irrid inkun kuntent.
The only way.	L-uniku mod.
I wasn’t thinking well	Ma kontx naħseb tajjeb
You want to take some time.	Trid tieħu ftit ħin.
If he was going to do it, he needed to do it.	Jekk kien se jagħmel dan, kellu bżonn jagħmel dan.
I had to do more	Kelli nagħmel aktar
I didn’t know there was so much	Ma kontx naf li kien hemm daqshekk
He was currently on his own.	Bħalissa kien fuq tiegħu.
It's school.	Huwa l-iskola.
It was more the same.	Kien aktar l-istess.
Everything was so.	Kollox kien hekk.
I didn’t try, but it happened	Ma kontx nipprova, imma ġara
And that looks good.	U dan jidher tajjeb.
I have to be able to do this job	Għandi nkun kapaċi nagħmel dan ix-xogħol
Today we do the same thing.	Illum nagħmlu l-istess ħaġa.
I know where they are.	Naf fejn huma.
I couldn’t wait any longer	Ma stajtx nistenna aktar
There was a lot to see.	Kien hemm ħafna x'tara.
It was needed now.	Kien hemm bżonn issa.
I didn’t think it was me	Ma kontx naħseb li kont jien
I'll try that.	Jien ser nipprova dak.
He can't make money.	Ma jistax jagħmel flus.
I just knew it was	Kont naf biss li kien
It's just.	Huwa biss.
This would look bad.	Dan ikun jidher ħażin.
I don’t take anything.	Jien ma nieħu xejn.
Now, everyone is seeing the same thing.	Issa, kulħadd qed jara l-istess ħaġa.
He could have said that.	Seta’ qal hekk.
I didn’t know where to go.	Ma kontx naf minn fejn immur.
I don’t do that.	Jien ma nagħmel hekk.
I can't say if he knows	Ma nistax ngħid jekk jafx
I know tomorrow morning	Naf għada filgħodu
I will not be interested	Mhux se nkun interessat
You are right.	Għandek raġun.
I can't go any further.	Ma nistax immur aktar.
I needed time alone	Jien kelli bżonn il-ħin waħdi
I just wanted to know where it came from	Ridt biss inkun naf minn fejn ġej
Maybe you're right.	Forsi għandek raġun.
I saw it all	Rajt dan kollu
That was bad.	Hekk kienet ħażina.
Well, that should do it.	Ukoll, dan għandu jagħmel.
Neither is she, really.	Lanqas hi, il-verità.
I will be with you soon	Jien se nkun miegħek, dalwaqt
I think he was right	Naħseb li kellu raġun
So we did.	Hekk għamilna.
He was thinking a lot.	Kien qed jaħseb ħafna.
He can't, he can't, he can't.	Ma jistax, ma jistax, ma jistax.
I will do whatever it takes	Jien se nagħmel dak kollu li hemm bżonn
But there was no one.	Imma ma kien hemm ħadd.
We went to school together.	Konna l-iskola flimkien.
We don’t even know how it looked.	Lanqas nafu kif deher.
I won’t think about it anymore	Mhux se naħseb aktar
Just planning something.	Biss li qed jippjana xi ħaġa.
I didn’t want or need it either	Jien ma ridtx jew bżonn ukoll
Look.	Ħares.
They all do that.	Huma kollha jagħmlu dan.
That takes a lot out of a person	Li jieħu ħafna minn persuna
I will never do anything for you	Jien qatt ma nagħmel xejn għalik
He lives.	Jgħix.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha.
I can't do more than that	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar minn hekk
I can't tell you.	Ma nistax ngħidlek.
I want to try to make things better	Irrid nipprova nagħmel l-affarijiet aħjar
I thought it was you	Ħsibt li kont int
And so it began.	U hekk beda.
It should be good.	Għandu jkun tajjeb.
I have to say something	Irrid ngħid xi ħaġa
I didn’t want this for you	Ma ridtx dan għalik
I really couldn't tell you why	Verament ma stajtx ngħidlek għaliex
I can't say what it is	Ma nistax ngħid x'inhu
I can be yours, if you like	Jien nista' nkun tiegħek, jekk tixtieq
I have a problem.	Għandi problema.
Time in years.	Żmien fi snin.
I know what's coming	Naf x'inhu ġej
They were there, and here we are.	Kienu hemm, u hawn aħna.
It never comes.	Qatt ma jiġi.
My last chance.	L-aħħar ċans tiegħi.
I want to do something wrong	Irrid nagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina
We always will.	Aħna dejjem se.
It was a bit much.	Kien daqsxejn ħafna.
I say no he doesn’t.	Jien ngħid le hu ma jagħmilx hekk.
I want it to be so easy for me	Nixtieq li tkun daqshekk faċli għalija
It works for a while.	Jaħdem għal ftit.
I knew what he was going to do	Kont naf x’kien se jagħmel
I probably won't be home until late tonight	Probabbilment mhux se nkun id-dar sa tard illejla
Everyone is home by now.	Kulħadd huwa d-dar sa issa.
That was too much.	Dan kien wisq.
More on that later.	Aktar minn dan aktar tard.
I can understand that too	Jien nista' nifhem hekk ukoll
I was sure he knew more than he was saying	Kont ċert li kien jaf aktar milli kien qed jgħid
I'm still a little wrong	Għadni ftit ħażin
He was doing the same.	Kien jagħmel l-istess.
Or someone, really.	Jew xi ħadd, tassew.
I knew all about that too	Jien kont naf kollox dwar dak ukoll
I believe everything you say.	Nemmen dak kollu li tgħid.
I didn’t want to stay home.	Ma ridtx noqgħod id-dar.
There were no people.	Ma kienx hemm nies.
I knew he had done what he thought was right	Kont naf li kien għamel dak li ħaseb li kien tajjeb
Obviously, no one died.	Ovvjament, ħadd ma miet.
Like can anyone.	Bħal jista 'jkun xi ħadd.
I didn’t want to think so.	Ma ridtx naħseb hekk.
She knew too much.	Kienet taf wisq.
It will be easy now.	Issa se jkun faċli.
Maybe just me.	Forsi jien biss.
I like to be outside	Inħobb inkun barra
She would be with me now.	Kieku kienet miegħi issa.
I really wanted that too	Jien tassew ridt dan ukoll
There was good as well.	Kien hemm tajjeb ukoll.
Everything was still.	Kollox kien għadu.
You moved after.	Int mort wara.
I think you say a few things.	Naħseb li tgħid ftit affarijiet.
I had no friends there	Ma kellix ħbieb hemmhekk
I knew this was not going to be easy	Kont naf li dan mhux se jkun faċli
It was with me.	Kien miegħi.
There will be tomorrow.	Se jkun hemm għada.
Thing is not something before you know it.	Ħaġa mhix xi ħaġa qabel ma tkun taf.
I will probably do so tomorrow	Probabbilment se nagħmel hekk għada
I still don't know how	Għadni ma nafx kif
Everything was the same.	Kollox kien l-istess.
He will definitely stay there again.	Żgur li se jerġa' joqgħod hemm.
I wasn’t thinking	Jien ma kontx qed naħseb
I think it could be wrong.	Naħseb li jista 'jkun ħażin.
The car I can't hear anymore	Il-karozza ma nistax nisma aktar
I thought I might be surprised	Ħsibt li seta’ kien sorpriż
I was surprised at how easy it was	Kont sorpriż kemm kien faċli
We had everything there.	Kellna kollox hemmhekk.
I think it was a good idea	Naħseb li kienet idea tajba
You want to be well.	Trid tkun ukoll.
And three other friends.	U tliet ħbieb oħra.
I didn’t even know who she was at the time	Lanqas kont naf min kienet dak iż-żmien
I know you're mine	Naf li int tiegħi
I wish it was before	Nixtieq li kien qabel
I was right every time.	Kelli raġun kull darba.
I know what we're going to do tomorrow	Naf x’se nkunu qed nagħmlu għada
I want one of mine	Irrid wieħed minn tiegħi
I knew why, it had happened too	Kont naf għaliex, kien ġara wisq
I wonder who lives there now	Nistaqsi min jgħix hemmhekk issa
I understand how everything works.	Nifhem kif jaħdem kollox.
Isn't that something? 	Mhux dik xi ħaġa?
He has never done so before.	Qatt ma għamel hekk qabel.
I think he has an idea there	Naħseb li għandu idea hemmhekk
I didn’t have to do any more	Ma kellix għalfejn nagħmel aktar
I can't do that	Ma nistax nagħmel b'dan
It would be great for him.	Ikun kbir għalih.
I didn't want anyone to know what was going on here	Ma ridt li ħadd ikun jaf x’hemm hawn
It was really a good thing too.	Kienet tassew ħaġa tajba wisq.
He really didn't know what to do.	Huwa verament ma kienx jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
I think he is more likely to be than a man.	Naħseb li huwa aktar probabbli li jkun minn raġel.
But it's not working.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem.
And never one like that.	U qatt wieħed bħal dan.
I can’t and won’t think about it	Ma nistax u mhux se naħseb dwarha
I was better that way	Jien kont aħjar hekk
We do, not often.	Aħna, biex ma, spiss.
He was a very good friend.	Kien ħabib kbir ħafna.
It's good to do either.	Huwa tajjeb li tagħmel jew.
You don’t do these things.	Inti ma tagħmilx dawn l-affarijiet.
But no more.	Imma mhux aktar.
I was not a child yet.	Ma kontx għadni tifel.
And it can.	U dan jista '.
I can be there.	Jien nista' nkun hemm.
I was still childless	Jien kont għadni bla tifel
We know how it goes.	Nafu kif sejjer.
Glad it’s getting better now.	Ferħan li sejjer aħjar issa.
That was not a man.	Dak ma kienx raġel.
Not enough money.	Mhux biżżejjed flus.
I probably shouldn’t talk too much	Probabbilment m'għandix nitkellem wisq
I wasn't just scared anymore	I ma kienx biss jibża aktar
I was too surprised	Kont sorpriż wisq
I was thinking a lot.	Kont qed naħseb ħafna.
He did not know where he was.	Ma kienx jaf fejn kien.
Look back at the house.	Ħares lura lejn id-dar.
I really can't wait for this!	Verament ma nistax nistenna dan!
I can’t do all this alone	Ma nistax nagħmel dan kollu waħdi
I will definitely try this	Żgur li se nipprova dan
But no, nothing.	Imma le, xejn.
Everyone was surprised.	Kulħadd kien sorpriż.
I just have one more thing to say	Għandi biss ħaġa oħra xi ngħid
I spent three years there	Għamilt tliet snin hemmhekk
Not a problem.	Mhix problema.
I want to see where the school goes	Irrid nara fejn tmur l-iskola
Everything must be fine.	Kollox irid ikun tajjeb.
A man came into the room	Raġel daħal fil-kamra
I want to know who they are.	Irrid inkun naf min huma.
I have, you know that	Ikolli, inti taf li
He couldn't do anything like that.	Ma seta’ jagħmel xejn bħal dan.
No one wants to talk.	Ħadd ma jrid jitkellem.
Maybe you just need to plan more than before.	Forsi għandek bżonn biss tippjana aktar minn qabel.
When was this.	Meta kien dan.
I thought it was a great idea	Ħsibt li kienet idea kbira
Both here and there.	Kemm hawn kif ukoll hemm.
I didn’t know they were there	Ma kontx naf li kienu hemm
He had seen that.	Huwa kien ra li.
I don’t believe that either	Ma nemmen li lanqas
I want to be your friend	Irrid inkun ħabib tiegħek
I just want to talk to him	Irrid biss nitkellem miegħu
And that was that.	U dak kien dak.
Many times before.	Ħafna drabi qabel.
I needed to think.	Kelli bżonn naħseb.
I still do.	Għadni nagħmel.
But you never know for sure.	Imma qatt ma tkun taf żgur.
I wasn't happy.	Jien ma kontx kuntent.
I'm fine with that.	Jien tajjeb ma' dak.
I was hoping for more	Kont nittama għal aktar
He is a great man.	Huwa raġel kbir.
I can’t really be with him and do a lot	Ma nistax verament inkun miegħu u nagħmel ħafna
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
I couldn’t believe what just happened	Ma stajtx nemmen dak li ġara biss
I was still here and alone	Jien kont għadni hawn u waħdi
I need to see everything	Għandi bżonn nara kollox
He couldn't ask for more.	Ma setax talab aktar.
He could not do that.	Ma setax jagħmel dan.
Sorry for you too.	Jiddispjaċini għalik ukoll.
After that.	Wara dan.
I really have to try	Verament għandi nipprova
I was ready to talk to him again	Kont lest li nerġa’ nitkellem miegħu
But of course this could not be.	Imma ovvjament dan ma setax ikun.
I was pretty scared	Jien kont nibża’ pjuttost
I just need to talk to you	Għandi bżonn biss nitkellem miegħek
You know whatever.	Inti taf tkun xi tkun.
Nothing ever stays the same.	Xejn qatt ma jibqa l-istess.
He looked tired.	Huwa deher għajjien.
I couldn’t stay there, with that, anymore	I ma stajtx noqgħod hemm, ma 'dak, aktar
Before too long, you sit down and eat.	Qabel twil wisq, inti toqgħod bilqiegħda u tiekol.
I know when something goes wrong	Naf meta xi ħaġa tkun ħażina
It looked the same.	Deher l-istess.
I don’t know how to do it	Ma nafx kif nagħmel
I really like this last one	Inħobb ħafna din l-aħħar waħda
She knew she didn't have much.	Kienet taf li ma tantx kellha.
We did so.	Għamilna hekk.
That would be too much to look forward to.	Dan ikun wisq biex wieħed jistenna.
I couldn't understand what happened or why.	Ma stajtx nifhem x’ġara jew għaliex.
I know what's going on	Naf x’qed jiġri
It's easier, and better, to make yours.	Huwa aktar faċli, u aħjar, li tagħmel tiegħek.
I love being out here	Inħobb inkun hawn barra
You did really well there.	Inti għamilt tassew tajjeb hemmhekk.
I only know what you know.	Naf biss dak li taf.
I didn't know what it was like then	Ma kontx naf x’kien dak iż-żmien
You are going to do what you do well.	Inti tmur tagħmel dak li tagħmel tajjeb.
I just wanted to know about one thing	Ridt biss inkun naf dwar ħaġa waħda
You don't even know it.	Inti lanqas biss taf dan.
I’m the only one who says where she is.	Jien l-unika waħda li tgħid fejn hi.
Well, most people don't like it.	Ukoll, ħafna nies ma bħal dan.
I didn’t always look like this	Jien mhux dejjem deher bħal dan
Over and over again.	Wieħed u ieħor.
Nobody knows.	Ħadd ma nafu.
He had something she didn’t.	Huwa kellu xi ħaġa li hi ma kinitx.
It will never come my way.	Qatt mhu se jiġi mod tiegħi.
I didn't want to go	Ma ridtx imur
He said you know.	Qal li taf.
I know how everything works	Naf kif jaħdem kollox
I hope this helps.	Nispera li dan ikun ta' għajnuna.
I know what's going on now	Naf x'qed jiġri issa
I will have to try again.	Ikolli nerġa' nipprova.
I better do it now.	Aħjar nagħmel hekk issa.
This can be just as well.	Dan jista 'jkun biss ukoll.
I hope he wins.	Nispera li jirbaħ.
That’s great, it really is.	Dak kbir, huwa verament.
I just need to know one thing quickly	Għandi bżonn biss inkun naf ħaġa waħda malajr
It can’t be that bad.	Ma jistax ikun daqshekk ħażin.
I didn’t know until after it happened	Ma kontx naf sa wara li ġara
He said he had enough people at work.	Qal li kellu biżżejjed nies fuq ix-xogħol.
The car has to be good.	Il-karozza trid tkun tajba.
I know your work, of course.	Naf ix-xogħol tiegħek, ovvjament.
I certainly wasn't expecting that	Żgur li ma kontx qed nistenna hekk
I can’t say much more right now	Ma nistax ngħid ħafna aktar bħalissa
I wanted you.	Ridt int.
I didn’t know how to be a man	Ma kontx naf kif inkun raġel
I wanted to be a teacher	Ridt inkun għalliem
To be as I once was.	Biex tkun kif kont darba.
I didn’t even have to do a lot of work	Lanqas kelli għalfejn nagħmel ħafna xogħol
No you can't.	Le ma tistax.
I was late.	Kont tard.
He is a good person.	Huwa persuna tajba.
I'm afraid it's not very long at all	Nibża li ma tantx twil xejn
I know how hard it must be for you	Naf kemm trid tkun diffiċli għalik
I need that done today	Għandi bżonn li dan isir illum
It can't be done.	Ma jistax isir.
That was well.	Li kien ukoll.
It was really easy for me to do that.	Għalija kien tassew faċli li nagħmel dan.
And, we do.	U, nagħmlu.
I want to have years to tell you	Irrid ikolli snin biex ngħidlek
I can only take you on that	I jista 'biss tieħu inti fuq dak
I was never happy	Qatt ma kont ferħan
And it doesn't stay that big.	U jibqa’ mhux daqshekk kbir.
It was something she usually would never do.	Kienet xi ħaġa li hi normalment qatt ma kienet tagħmel.
I want to know what he's doing there	Irrid inkun naf x’qed jagħmel hemmhekk
There was nothing to say.	Ma kien hemm xejn xi ngħid.
I would be there for everyone	Inkun hemm għal kulħadd
Who is ours.	Min tagħna.
I want to be whatever you want to be	Irrid li tkun dak kollu li trid tkun
Every morning they were.	Kull filgħodu kienu.
She will never be able to do that.	Hija qatt ma tkun kapaċi tagħmel dan.
I know this too well	Naf dan wisq tajjeb
He would have nothing.	Ma kien ikollu xejn.
I want to be me all	Irrid li tkun jien kollha
How.	Kif.
But for too many people it is.	Imma għal wisq nies huwa.
I'm sure it will do well.	Jiena ċert li se tagħmel tajjeb.
I would like that.	Nixtieq hekk.
I just need someone to talk to	Għandi bżonn biss lil xi ħadd biex nitkellem
I'm better than that	Jien aħjar minn hekk
I would like to be here.	Nixtieq inkun hawn.
It is forever and ever.	Hu minn dejjem għal dejjem.
But he needed to know more.	Imma kellu bżonn ikun jaf aktar.
I need to talk to someone.	Għandi bżonn nitkellem ma' xi ħadd.
Or maybe they should.	Jew forsi għandhom.
I thought about it from the afternoon.	Ħsibt dwarha minn wara nofsinhar.
It was too early.	Kien kmieni wisq.
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
Never talk to us about school again.	Qatt ma aktar titkellem magħna dwar l-iskola.
I'm not a bad man.	Jien mhux raġel ħażin.
Why? 	Għaliex?
I just wanted to be sure	Ridt biss inkun ċert
He didn't have to be here.	Ma kellux għalfejn ikun hawn.
He said that every year.	Huwa qal li kull sena.
I still want to do a few things with you	Għadni rrid nagħmel ftit affarijiet miegħek
He knew where she was.	Kien jaf fejn kienet.
I think it looks really nice now	Naħseb li tidher tassew sabiħa issa
We are what we do.	Aħna dak li nagħmlu.
I’m sure you see where this is going	Jien ċert li tara fejn sejjer dan
I don't think there's anything he can say	Naħseb li m'hemm xejn li jista' jgħid
I didn’t even have to think about it	Lanqas kelli għalfejn naħseb dwarha
And last night he did so.	U lbieraħ filgħaxija hekk għamel.
I know I wasn’t there.	Naf li ma kontx hemm.
I wanted to be me and me alone	Ridt li tkun jien u jien biss
You just have to.	Int trid biss.
About something, she would say.	Dwar xi ħaġa, kienet tgħid.
I will be a good man	Jien se nkun raġel tajjeb
I want to tell you.	Irrid ngħidlek.
It was a lot of trying.	Kien jipprova ħafna.
She knows better than anyone.	Hija taf aħjar minn ħadd.
I didn’t even know why.	Lanqas kont naf għaliex.
I didn’t want any of that	Jien ma ridt xejn minn hekk
She was the only one who did.	Kienet l-unika waħda li għamlet.
I have more to tell you tomorrow evening	Ikolli aktar xi ngħidlek għada filgħaxija
I need to be back home	Għandi bżonn inkun lura d-dar
Maybe there was more.	Forsi kien hemm aktar.
I couldn’t think about it now	Ma stajtx naħseb dwarha issa
But it was hard not to.	Imma kien diffiċli li ma.
I think he still doesn’t know so well	Naħseb li għadu ma jafx daqshekk tajjeb
This is just good.	Dan huwa biss tajjeb.
It’s not a way to be.	Mhuwiex mod li tkun.
I was with you all the time	Kont miegħek il-ħin kollu
But you can’t do anything about it.	Imma ma tistax tagħmel xejn dwarha.
I couldn’t do it alone	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan waħdi
Everyone is trying so hard.	Kulħadd qed jipprova tant.
I wasn’t sure if it was or not	Ma kontx ċert jekk kienx jew le
Did you know it was there.	Kont taf li kien hemm.
Neither is she.	Lanqas hi.
I want to be there tonight.	Irrid inkun hemm illejla.
it was too late last night.	kien sa tard wisq ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
We, you'll see that.	Aħna, inti ser tara li.
Very bad, very bad.	Ħażin ħafna, ħażin ħafna.
One or the other.	Wieħed jew ieħor.
I was very wrong	Kont ħażin ħafna
There has never been an easy way.	Qatt ma kien hemm mod faċli.
There is no one out now.	M'hemm ħadd issa barra.
There may also be many other people.	Jista 'jkun hemm ukoll ħafna nies oħra.
I had to do something	I kellha tagħmel xi ħaġa
He is doing what needs to be done.	Qed jagħmel dak li jrid isir.
But it was no more.	Imma ma kinitx aktar.
As you say.	Kif tgħid.
I think it’s better for him	Naħseb li hu aħjar għalih
It does not appear.	Ma jidhirx.
I think this is what happened	Naħseb li dan huwa dak li ġara
And for us.	U għalina.
I just wanted to be me	Ridt biss inkun jien
But no people were out.	Imma l-ebda nies ma kienu barra.
Maybe it wasn’t too late.	Forsi ma kienx tard wisq.
We will be back before you know it.	Se nkunu lura qabel ma tkun taf.
Is it really what you want ?.	Huwa verament dak li trid?.
I said it was.	Jien għidt li kien.
I didn’t like sitting down	Ma kontx inħobb noqgħod bilqiegħda
That’s still not easy.	Dak għadu mhux faċli.
In fact, there is no money.	Fil-fatt, m'hemm l-ebda flus.
It was going well.	Kien sejjer tajjeb.
Some people you just know.	Xi nies li taf biss.
I’m sure I’ve seen this	Jiena ċert li rajt dan
I just stay with him	Jien biss noqgħod miegħu
But she is a good boy.	Imma hi tifel tajjeb.
He never told me anything else.	Qatt ma qalli xi ħaġa oħra.
And that of course he never had.	U li ovvjament qatt ma kellu.
Maybe he had.	Forsi kellu.
I wasn’t going to wait any longer	Ma kontx se nistenna aktar
I shouldn't do that	M'għandix nagħmel dan
I knew exactly what he was doing	Kont naf eżatt x’kien qed jagħmel
I know exactly where they are	Naf eżatt fejn huma
I know he wouldn’t be right with me.	Naf li ma jkunx tajjeb miegħi.
I hope you are not	Nispera li m'intix hekk
Who would have said something like that.	Min kien jgħid xi ħaġa bħal din.
Nothing like that.	Xejn bħal dan.
The truth is that no one can be sure yet.	Il-verità hi li ħadd għadu ma jista’ jkun ċert.
I have seen this too many times before	Rajt dan wisq drabi qabel
I wonder what you are doing now	Nistaqsi x'qed tagħmel issa
I really wasn’t there.	Verament ma kontx hemm.
I still have so many friends there	Għadni tant ħbieb hemmhekk
It's a lot.	Huwa ħafna.
Not a big one.	Mhux waħda kbira.
I wasn’t going to stay there for a very long time	Ma kontx se noqgħod hemm għal żmien twil ħafna
I have a lot of time with you	Għandi ħafna ħin miegħek
Not now, not anymore.	Mhux issa, mhux aktar.
It was years ago.	Kien snin ilu.
I know who they are.	Naf min huma.
Just a little glad	Ftit biss ferħan
I'm pretty good.	Jien pjuttost tajjeb.
I had to do some work there	I kellha tagħmel xi xogħol hemmhekk
I was ready to go home	Kont lest biex immur id-dar
You will never be around.	Inti qatt ma tkun madwar.
But if it’s not working, it’s not working.	Imma jekk mhux qed jaħdem, mhux qed jaħdem.
No one needs to know.	Ħadd ma għandu bżonn ikun jaf.
And it has been so long.	U ilu tant.
It happens quite often, in fact.	Jiġri pjuttost ta 'spiss, fil-fatt.
I don’t know if she was in the room.	Ma nafx jekk kinitx fil-kamra.
He really was here.	Huwa verament kien hawn.
I know what will happen there	Naf x'se jiġri hemmhekk
That, of course, was not enough.	Dak, ovvjament, ma kienx biżżejjed.
I doubt much of that.	Niddubita ħafna minn hekk.
A year ago, it wouldn’t have been	Sena ilu, ma kienx ikun
I thought it looked bad	Ħsibt li deher ħażin
And so it is.	U hekk hi.
Maybe so, but there is no way around it.	Forsi, hekk imma m'hemm l-ebda mod madwar dan.
Not so today.	Mhux hekk illum.
I hope it looks better.	Nittama li jidher aħjar.
It's going so well.	Qed sejjer daqshekk tajjeb.
It looks like we don't even know each other anymore.	Qisu lanqas biss nafu aktar lil xulxin.
I didn’t do that	Jien ma kontx nagħmel dan
She wants to.	Hi trid .
No one else will do that for us.	Ħadd ieħor mhu se jagħmel dan għalina.
I will have to buy another.	Ikolli nixtri ieħor.
I know enough to do that	Naf biżżejjed biex nagħmel dan
I have to try something	Ikolli nipprova xi ħaġa
I didn't stand a chance	Ma kellix ċans
I don’t do any of these things	Jien ma nagħmel xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet
Try them all.	Ipprova kollha kemm huma.
I know what it was	Naf naf dak li kien
I did that too	Jien għamilt dan ukoll
You are saying something about this.	Qed tgħid xi ħaġa b'dan.
I have no idea where he lives	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn jgħix
Have you had one before now ?.	Kellek waħda qabel issa?.
I knew what was going to happen next	Kont naf x'kien se jiġri wara
I expect that.	Nistenna li.
That was good.	Dan kien tajjeb.
I can’t believe this happened	Ma nistax nemmen li dan ġara
I was a kid, you know	Kont tifel, taf
I have no idea where he is	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn hu
He's quite right.	Huwa pjuttost raġun'.
He never saw what happened next.	Qatt ma ra x’ġara wara.
I thought this would be harder	Ħsibt li dan ikun aktar diffiċli
If so, this is great.	Jekk hekk, dan huwa kbir.
You want to know.	Trid tkun taf.
I can't understand the problem	Ma nistax nifhem il-problema
I almost died.	I kważi miet.
He just came.	Huwa biss daħal.
I was for nothing	Kont għal xejn
I love this time of morning.	Inħobb dan il-ħin ta’ filgħodu.
He knows nothing.	Ma jaf xejn.
He wanted more.	Ried aktar.
I didn’t want to talk about the truth.	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwar il-verità.
In fact, it was a good thing.	Fil-fatt, din kienet ħaġa tajba.
There should be nothing.	Għandu jkun hemm xejn.
And please.	U jekk jogħġbok.
It was hard to know for sure.	Kien diffiċli li tkun taf xi ħaġa żgur.
I don’t want you to see this	Ma rridx li tara dan
I was just happy.	Kont kuntent biss.
I must have done something right	I għandu għamilt xi ħaġa tajba
I wasn’t even able to do that	Jien lanqas kont kapaċi nagħmel hekk
Both were one.	It-tnejn kienu wieħed.
I'm waiting here.	Nistenna hawn.
I have no idea if you can or not	M'għandix idea jekk tistax jew le
I didn’t want to talk about it	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwarha
Maybe they are right.	Forsi għandhom raġun.
I still can't.	Għadni ma nistax.
Or it will happen.	Jew se jiġri.
The first he had seen in a long time.	L-ewwel li kien ra fi żmien twil.
Or not enough people.	Jew mhux biżżejjed nies.
But it takes a long time.	Imma jieħu ħafna żmien.
He told me that.	Huwa qalli li.
I see you have both	Nara li għandek it-tnejn
I need you to do something for me	Għandi bżonn li tagħmel xi ħaġa għalija
Surely it was.	Żgur li kien.
I want to do this as much as she does	Irrid nagħmel dan daqs kemm tagħmel hi
I've been.	Stajt kont.
This is a big bill.	Dan huwa kont kbir.
Not once has this happened.	Mhux darba hekk ġara.
I was thinking the same thing	Kont qed naħseb l-istess ħaġa
I think he just needs time	Naħseb li għandu bżonn iż-żmien biss
If there was one.	Kieku kien hemm wieħed.
He didn’t know where to stay.	Ma kienx jaf fejn għandu joqgħod.
But that's what you have to do.	Imma dak hu li għandek tagħmel.
She knows this.	Hija taf dan.
I’m, after all, just one	Jien, wara kollox, wieħed biss
And so she did.	U hekk għamlet.
I have no idea how long it has been there	M'għandi l-ebda idea kemm ilu hemm
Me and you too	Jien wieħed u int ukoll
And they are many.	U dawn huma ħafna.
I'm fine with that.	Jien tajjeb ma' dan.
But that's what happens.	Imma huwa dak li jiġri.
He says you can go home.	Jgħid li tista’ tmur id-dar.
I know he did for me.	Naf li għamel għalija.
No one else knows.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jkun jaf.
I knew I wouldn't listen or go back	Kont naf li ma nisma’ jew nerġa’ lura
Surely it was.	Żgur li kien.
But he can really get to you.	Imma huwa jista 'verament jasal għalik.
It couldn’t be my dog.	Ma setax ikun il-kelb tiegħi.
Now that we know what it is, we have a chance.	Issa li nafu x’inhu, għandna ċans.
I just want to be you and me	Irrid biss li tkun int u jien
I need your help tonight	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek illejla
Nothing to survive.	Xejn biex jgħix.
We have.	Għandna  .
Not before he got there.	Mhux qabel ma wasal hemm.
She had to do it.	Kellha tagħmel dan.
I did this on my own	Dan għamilt waħdi
I have been here many times	Kont hawn ħafna drabi
That there is nothing more.	Li m'hemm xejn aktar.
Well, the same thing about a person.	Ukoll, l-istess ħaġa dwar persuna.
I heard there.	Smajt li hemm.
I didn't even know what was going to happen	Lanqas kont naf x’kien se jiġri
He wants to go.	Irid imur.
That evening there will be plenty.	Dik il-lejla se jkun hemm ħafna.
She needed help with me.	Hija kellha bżonn l-għajnuna miegħi.
I have been for quite some time now	Ilni għal żmien mhux ħażin issa
And it was easy to talk to him.	U kien faċli biex titkellem miegħu.
You are my first person.	Int l-ewwel persuna tiegħi.
I have friends there	Għandi ħbieb hemmhekk
It does.	Hekk jagħmel.
Really, really great.	Tassew, tassew kbir.
I knew nothing about it or about	Ma kont naf xejn dwarha jew dwar
I had no idea what was going on	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'qed jiġri
I was very worried about this problem.	Kont inkwetat ħafna dwar din il-problema.
It never works that way.	Qatt ma jaħdem hekk.
Time is nothing.	Iż-żmien mhu xejn.
I thought you knew your stuff	Ħsibt li taf l-affarijiet tiegħek
I was there last night.	Jien kont hemm ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
I want to talk about this	Irrid nitkellem dwar dan
She was here today.	Hija kienet hawn illum.
I just want him to say what he knows	Irrid biss li jgħid dak li jaf
This is just wrong.	Dan huwa biss ħażin.
He is capable of better things.	Huwa kapaċi għal affarijiet aħjar.
There was enough of this.	Kien hemm biżżejjed minn dan.
He obviously wasn’t taking what he wanted.	Huwa ovvjament ma kienx qed jieħu dak li ried.
It can be busy.	Jista 'jkun okkupat.
I said there would be nothing.	Għidt li ma jkun hemm xejn.
I was really good	Kont verament tajjeb
I can’t think of you either	Ma nistax naħseb għalik ukoll
I still do that.	Għadni nagħmel dan.
I said it wasn’t bad	Jien għidt li ma kienx ħażin
I didn’t know anything about it	Jien ma kont naf xejn dwarha
There is the truth.	Hemm il-verità.
She had enough problems.	Kellha biżżejjed problemi.
I can't tell anyone about this	Ma nista’ ngħid lil ħadd dwar dan
Everything is yours.	Kollox huwa tiegħek.
I meant no.	Ridt ngħid le.
You are not supposed to do that.	Mhux suppost tagħmel dan.
I’m very worried about that.	Jien inkwetat ħafna dwar dan.
That is just what happened.	Li huwa biss dak li ġara.
I was here when it started	Jien kont hawn meta dan beda
That was not good.	Dak ma kienx tajjeb.
I want to be with you	Irrid inkun miegħek
I do everything for myself.	Jien nagħmel kollox għalija.
I know everyone.	Naf lil kulħadd.
I’ve done this before	Jien kont nagħmel dan qabel
It's still here.	Għadu hawn.
I never knew when it would come.	Qatt ma kont taf meta kien jiġi.
I know where this is going	Naf fejn sejjer dan
It doesn't have to be.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun ġara.
That was the last time he appeared.	Dik kienet l-aħħar darba li deher.
And he couldn't go back.	U ma setax imur lura.
She will be there.	Hi ser tkun hemm.
She didn't know.	Hija ma kinitx taf.
Everything.	Kollox.
I didn’t want to tell you, but there it is.	Ma ridtx ngħidlek, imma hemm.
I wanted to say things	Ridt ngħid affarijiet
Or it could be something you do on your own.	Jew tista’ tkun xi ħaġa li tagħmel waħdek.
He saw things he shouldn't have seen.	Huwa ra affarijiet li ma kellux jara.
I said yes and left	Għidt x’inhu u telaq
There was never enough time.	Qatt ma kien hemm ħin biżżejjed.
I couldn’t talk to him anymore	Ma stajtx nitkellem miegħu aktar
I can't sit here	Ma nistax toqgħod bilqiegħda hawn
I can understand that	Jien nista' nifhem dan
No, you went too far.	Le, inti mort wisq.
I want to see things you can't	Nixtieq nara affarijiet li inti ma tistax
I’ve never heard anything like that	Qatt ma smajt xi ħaġa bħal dik
Obviously not now.	Ovvjament mhux issa.
I don’t see anything wrong with doing what you want to do.	Ma nara xejn ħażin li tagħmel dak li trid tagħmel.
It's above.	Qiegħed hawn fuq.
I can’t just say it’s not mine.	Ma nistax ngħid biss li mhux tiegħi.
I have no idea when he will be back	M'għandi l-ebda idea meta se jkun lura
I could do without it	Jien stajt nagħmel mingħajr dan
I don’t really know why.	Ma nafx verament għalfejn.
I couldn't hear anyone	Ma stajt nisma lil ħadd
I always, you know	Jien dejjem, taf
I hope it will, you know	Nistenna li se, taf
That he would do so.	Li kien jagħmel hekk.
Something will happen.	Se jiġri xi ħaġa.
And for nothing.	U għal xejn.
The last one.	L-aħħar waħda.
It's not here.	Mhuwiex hawn.
I'm done with it.	Jien lest miegħu.
Eat both.	Tiekol it-tnejn.
It just gets better from here.	Huwa biss isir aħjar minn hawn.
I can only stand so long	I tista 'biss toqgħod daqshekk
This doesn’t look too good to me.	Dan ma jidhirx wisq tajjeb għalija.
He said nothing.	Ma qal xejn.
As far as he knew he was the only one.	Sa fejn kien jaf hu kien l-uniku wieħed.
What I did is good.	Dak li għamilt huwa tajjeb.
Once upon a time there was one.	Darba kienet waħda.
I was very busy	Jien kont okkupat ħafna
There was nothing here.	Hawn ma kien hemm xejn.
We already have enough problems.	Diġà għandna biżżejjed problemi.
I haven’t been in years.	Ilni snin ma kontx.
I knew it would be good to come here	Kont naf li jkun tajjeb li tiġi hawn
But it was not easy.	Imma ma kienx faċli.
I hope all is well	Nispera li kollox tajjeb
It was a long time ago.	Kien żmien twil ilu.
I told someone about it	Għidt lil xi ħadd dwarha
So it goes, around and around.	Hekk imur, madwar u madwar.
I always have time for you	Jien dejjem għandi ħin għalik
Why? 	Għaliex?
I will try to do the same here	Jien se nipprova nagħmel l-istess hawn
He didn’t have much to say.	Ma kellux ħafna xi jgħid.
You can go home.	Tista’ tmur lura d-dar.
But he couldn't.	Imma ma setax.
This too is not so great.	Dan ukoll mhux daqshekk kbir.
I couldn't wait	Ma stajtx nistenna
My friends, whatever.	Ħbieb tiegħi, tkun xi tkun.
It was too early for anyone to be there.	Kien għadu kmieni wisq biex xi ħadd ikun hemm.
No one had ever done this before.	Ħadd qatt ma kien għamel dan qabel.
I knew you would be here	Kont naf li inti tkun hawn
Everyone is doing the same thing	Kulħadd qed jagħmel l-istess ħaġa
It has and or.	Għandu u jew.
I can wait until it takes	Nista' nistenna sakemm tieħu
There was one outside.	Kien hemm wieħed barra.
But it seems to work.	Imma jidher li jaħdem.
It had to be there.	Kellu jkun hemm.
Maybe never there.	Forsi qatt ma hemm.
Something was wrong wrong, he knew that.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina ħażin, kien jaf li.
She used to make things difficult.	Hi kienet tagħmel l-affarijiet diffiċli.
I had enough to sit on and do nothing	Kelli biżżejjed li noqgħod u ma nagħmel xejn
It will not be the same.	Mhux se jkun l-istess.
I was no longer happy	Ma kontx ferħan aktar
We had problems.	Kellna problemi.
She had to do it on her own.	Kellha tagħmel dan waħedha.
I’m all that’s ever been there	Jien dak kollu li qatt kien hemm
I could never understand why	Qatt ma stajt nifhem għaliex
But there is that.	Imma hemm li dan.
Ask who she was talking to.	Staqsa ma’ min kienet qed titkellem.
I won’t say anything else	Mhux se ngħid xi ħaġa oħra
You know it’s nothing.	Taf li mhu xejn.
I’m pretty good and pretty happy.	Jien pjuttost tajjeb u pjuttost kuntent.
I just happened upon where I was doing	I biss ġara fuq fejn kien qed isir
This had never been done before.	Dan qatt ma kien sar qabel.
As long as it takes.	Sakemm tieħu.
It looked good enough.	Deher tajjeb biżżejjed.
I didn't even know what it was	Lanqas kont naf x’kien
Your time is not now.	Il-ħin tiegħek mhux issa.
Its time.	Iż-żmien tiegħu.
And no one did that, either.	U ħadd ma għamel dan, lanqas.
Which for me is out.	Li għalija huwa barra.
He can wait.	Jista' jistenna.
I told only one friend.	Għidt ħabib wieħed biss.
We are friends.	Aħna ħbieb.
I was doing my job.	Kont qed nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi.
I still need to try	Għadni bżonn nipprova
Well as long as you want to.	Ukoll sakemm inti tixtieq li.
That just happened.	Dak biss ġara.
I wasn’t always like that	Jien mhux dejjem kont hekk
I did a lot of listening to everyone	Għamilt ħafna nisma lil kulħadd
She can go, she can't.	Hija tista 'tmur, hi tista' le.
I knew it was a bad idea	Kont naf li kienet idea ħażina
I think it was on to something.	Naħseb li kien fuq xi ħaġa.
I can't say how anyone knows	Ma nistax ngħid kif xi ħadd jista' jkun jaf
I had the same thing	Kelli l-istess ħaġa
But she is not.	Imma hi le.
I can't be happier	Ma nistax inkun aktar kuntent
This often happens.	Ħafna drabi jiġri hekk.
Did he know? 	Kien jaf?
I was scared of what I already was	Kont nibża’ minn dak li diġà kont
I did and still do.	Għamilt u għadni nagħmel.
I want to be your friend too	Irrid inkun ħabib tiegħek ukoll
About what really happened.	Dwar dak li verament ġara.
That’s all he knows.	Dak hu kollu li jaf.
I didn’t have a chance to buy anything yesterday	Ma kellix ċans nixtri xejn ilbieraħ
I had never done that before	Qatt ma kont għamilt hekk qabel
I need more time.	Għandi bżonn aktar ħin.
I never seemed to be able to do enough	Qatt ma deher li kont kapaċi nagħmel biżżejjed
But maybe not the last.	Imma forsi mhux l-aħħar.
And so we have.	U hekk għandna.
We don’t have much time.	M'għandniex ħafna ħin.
I wish he could talk to me now.	Nixtieq li jista’ jitkellem għalija issa.
I said it was hard for me	Għidt li kien diffiċli għalija
It may not even be likely to be one.	Jista 'jkun lanqas probabbli li huwa wieħed.
You can tell it will.	Tista 'tgħid li se.
I couldn’t go shopping.	Ma stajtx immur nixtri.
I saw it when I came back	Rajt meta ġejt lura
I wanted both	Ridt it-tnejn
All well and good.	Kollox tajjeb u tajjeb.
I have been there for years.	Ilni snin ilni hemm.
I know you're there	Naf li int hemmhekk
But it was someone else as well.	Imma kien xi ħadd ieħor ukoll.
I don't know what to say.	Ma nafx x'se ngħid.
I was saying the same thing	Kont qed ngħid l-istess ħaġa
He did this a few times when he was back.	Dan għamel xi ftit drabi meta kien lura.
He is never a single man.	Qatt mhu raġel wieħed.
He had not learned enough.	Ma kienx sar jaf biżżejjed.
I used to believe and think so.	Jien kont nemmen u naħseb hekk.
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi le.
He does what he says.	Jagħmel dak li jgħid.
There must be something else.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
There were no people around.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda nies madwar.
That may come later.	Dak jista’ jiġi aktar tard.
I like to eat a lot.	Inħobb niekol ħafna.
She was there with some friends.	Kienet hemm ma’ xi ħbieb.
No one really did.	Ħadd ma għamel verament.
I can’t be happier.	Ma nistax inkun kuntent.
No one is ever right or wrong.	Ħadd qatt ma għandu raġun jew ħażin.
But this is home.	Imma din hija d-dar.
When that.	Meta dak.
Not much.	Ma tantx.
I just need something	Għandi bżonn biss xi ħaġa
I’m not going to do that anymore	Jien mhux se nagħmel hekk aktar
I’ll probably wait a little later.	Probabbilment nistenna ftit aktar tard.
It was late in the evening.	Kien tard filgħaxija.
Okay, let’s go.	Tajjeb, ejja mmorru.
He knew his job.	Kien jaf ix-xogħol tiegħu.
I love this job.	Inħobb dan ix-xogħol.
But no, it wasn’t.	Imma le, ma kinitx.
I would be surprised if it weren’t so.	Inkun sorpriż kieku ma kienx hekk.
I still can’t believe he did that	Għadni ma nistax nemmen li għamel hekk
He was saying some things.	Kien qed jgħid xi affarijiet.
I'm sure yours isn't.	Jien ċert tiegħek mhux.
I hope there is nothing wrong with me	Nispera li m'hemm xejn ħażin miegħi
No one came home.	Ħadd ma ġie d-dar.
I'm doing well.	Jien sejjer tajjeb.
I’m still talking to him.	Għadni nitkellem miegħu.
I believe this is a good thing.	Nemmen li din hija ħaġa tajba.
It is very very small.	Huwa żgħir ħafna ħafna.
I went back to school.	Mort lura l-iskola.
Or something.	Jew xi ħaġa.
I hope it helps someone out there to know this.	Nispera li jgħin lil xi ħadd hemmhekk biex ikun jaf dan.
This is not mine.	Din mhix tiegħi.
That time now and come here.	Dak iż-żmien issa u wasal hawn.
I’m counting on that.	Jien noqgħod fuq dan.
It's pretty big.	Huwa pjuttost kbir.
I needed to talk about it with someone.	Kelli bżonn nitkellem dwarha ma’ xi ħadd.
And that we can’t do.	U li ma nistgħux nagħmlu.
I will tell the truth	Jien se ngħid il-verità
One was his.	Wieħed kien tiegħu.
I was very surprised that she seemed to be alone	Kont sorpriż ħafna li kienet tidher li kienet waħedha
My! 	Tiegħi!
I won’t talk to him anymore	Mhux se nitkellem miegħu aktar
I didn't know what to do	Ma kontx naf x’kien se jagħmel
I know what's coming.	Naf x'inhu ġej.
I need to go home actually	Għandi bżonn immur id-dar fil-fatt
And very quickly.	U malajr ħafna.
I still believe that.	Għadni nemmen li.
No one knew he was here.	Ħadd ma kien jaf li kien hawn.
But there had to be a way.	Imma kellu jkun hemm mod.
I don't know what happened.	Ma nafx x’ġara.
It was an afternoon he had been waiting for.	Kienet wara nofsinhar li kien qed jistenna.
I really didn't want to know	Verament ma ridtx inkun naf
I think not even today	Jiena naħseb li lanqas illum
I’m really sorry for that, you know	Jien tassew jiddispjaċini għal dan, taf
I have a job for you.	Għandi xogħol għalik.
I stick to what looks like hours	Noqgħod għal dak li jidher qisu sigħat
Jew le, le, le.	Jew le, le, le.
I really want to do that	Irrid verament nagħmel dan
Everything seemed to be going wrong.	Kollox deher sejjer ħażin.
Or maybe they do.	Jew forsi jagħmlu.
But, you are right.	Imma, għandek raġun.
I have to do something.	Ikolli nagħmel xi ħaġa.
I understand that.	Nifhem li.
And that one has to be me.	U dak wieħed irid inkun jien.
I didn't go to school	Jien ma mort l-iskola
I believe it is not working.	Nemmen li mhux qed jaħdem.
I obviously said no	Jien għedt ovvjament le
I can't believe this	Ma nistax nemmen dan
It just doesn't.	Huwa biss ma.
I’m not doing well at all.	Jien mhu sejjer tajjeb xejn.
You can stay.	Tista' toqgħod.
I wasn’t expecting this	Jien ma kontx qed nistenna dan
And look at that.	U ħares lejn dak.
He loves work.	Iħobb ix-xogħol.
I hope you can be here	Nispera li tista' tkun hawn
He just tells the truth.	Huwa biss jgħid il-verità.
Maybe there was a chance.	Forsi kien hemm ċans.
I know everything now.	Naf kollox issa.
It was just.	Kien biss.
She would never say anything like that.	Qatt ma kienet tgħid xi ħaġa bħal din.
Now it was too late.	Issa kien sar tard.
I know how much you want this	Naf kemm trid dan
I never wanted anyone else	Qatt ma ridt lil xi ħadd aktar
I can’t wait forever.	Ma nistax nistenna għal dejjem.
How he had not come.	Kif ma kienx daħal.
I know what happened	Naf x’ġara
There was another.	Kien hemm ieħor.
I don’t even believe it	Jien lanqas nemmen
We had a great time.	Kellna ħin tajjeb ħafna.
I didn’t want to say anything.	Ma ridt ngħid xejn.
Maybe that was talking.	Forsi dik kienet qed titkellem.
It wasn’t too much, or too little.	Ma kienx wisq, jew ftit wisq.
I have no idea what happened.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'ġara.
We are tired.	Aħna għajjien.
From here.	Minn hawn.
But we can.	Imma nistgħu.
She doesn’t do that too much.	Hija ma tagħmilx hekk wisq.
I had to go back	Kelli nagħmel lura
I was not good at talking to other people	Ma kontx tajjeb nitkellem ma’ nies oħra
You heard me.	Int smajt.
But it will be.	Imma se jkun.
I can't take it anymore	Ma nistax nieħu aktar
I want to hear everything	Irrid nisma kollox
I thought we were friends	Ħsibt li konna ħbieb
I went there once to have fun	Mort hemm darba biex nieħu gost
I hope to be back soon	Nispera li jkun lura dalwaqt
I was waiting.	Jien kont qed nistenna.
You have to go get some.	Għandek tmur tieħu ftit.
So has everyone.	Hekk għandu kulħadd.
She was not there.	Hija ma kinitx hemm.
We knew he had done that.	Konna nafu li kien għamel dan.
He shouldn't be here.	M’għandux jiġi hawn.
Maybe, he thought.	Forsi, ħaseb.
They were friends.	Kienu ħbieb.
You're not even my back.	Inti lanqas lura tiegħi.
Same with me.	L-istess miegħi.
I wanted to be these things	Jien ridt inkun dawn l-affarijiet
I did everything for you	Għamilt kollox għalik
I thought maybe everything would be fine	Ħsibt li forsi kollox jista’ jkun tajjeb
I will have to go in no time.	Ikolli mmur fi ftit ħin.
I didn't want to hear that	Ma ridtx nisma dan
I wonder what you are thinking	Nistaqsi x'qed taħseb
Now I can talk to you about everything.	Issa nista' nitkellem miegħek dwar kollox.
He did not know what to say.	Ma kienx jaf x’se jgħid.
I have a lot of time to think	Għandi ħafna ħin biex naħseb
And it actually wasn’t.	U fil-fatt ma kienx.
Don’t be here alone.	M'għandekx tkun hawn waħdek.
I see where it comes from.	Nara minn fejn ġej.
I wanted to do it all on my own	Ridt nagħmel dan kollu waħdi
I just can’t believe it	Jien biss ma nistax nemmen
I had no problem with that	Ma kelli l-ebda problema b'dan
I didn’t really think it could be you	Ma kontx verament naħseb li tista tkun int
We need to do more.	Irridu nagħmlu aktar.
I hope you can see it all now	Nispera li inti tista 'tara kollha issa
So bad.	Hekk hu ħażin.
There should be more.	Għandu jkun hemm aktar.
I will be back here soon	Jien se nkun immur lura hawn dalwaqt
I just need a teacher	Għandi bżonn biss għalliem
I did everything myself.	Jien għamilt kollox jien.
He can tell anyone.	Jista’ jgħid lil kulħadd.
I think it will be good	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb
I like talking to him	Inħobb nitkellem miegħu
I did what you want.	Jien għamilt dak li tixtieq.
We don't have time.	M'għandniex ħin.
That’s not much.	Dak mhux ħafna.
It was a great time.	Kien żmien kbir.
And so we knew.	U hekk konna nafu.
Maybe I heard.	Forsi smajt.
But nothing seemed a problem.	Imma xejn ma deher problema.
I really didn't want anything like that to happen	Verament ma ridtx li jiġri xi ħaġa bħal dik
I need to talk to you about something	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek dwar xi ħaġa
Look back into the room.	Ħares lura fil-kamra.
I can't believe you're here	Ma nistax nemmen li qiegħed hawn
The dog was there.	Il-kelb kien hemm.
Please, he said.	Jekk jogħġbok, qal.
I thought you’d like to come together	Ħsibt li tixtieq tiġi flimkien
I wasn’t always like that	Jien mhux dejjem kont hekk
I just want to live again.	Irrid biss li jerġa’ jgħix.
From what I did.	Minn dak li għamilt.
I haven't heard from anyone.	Ma smajt lil ħadd.
I will never regret it	Jien qatt mhu se jiddispjaċini minn hekk
Isn’t it time to do something about it ?.	Mhux wasal iż-żmien li nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwar dan?.
You are one year old.	Għandek sena.
I also wanted of course	Jien ridt ukoll ovvjament
I will always be there	Jien dejjem se nkun hemm
We have done this often before.	Dan għamilna spiss qabel.
Kelli.	Kelli.
I will be out all tomorrow	Jiena nkun barra kollha għada
I didn’t think anything about it	Jien ma ħsibt xejn dwarha
I wasn’t ready for that	Jien ma kontx lest għal dan
She wasn't now.	Hija ma kinitx issa.
Or Friday.	Jew il-ġimgħa.
I think that would be good.	Naħseb li tkun tajjeb.
To think that.	Biex taħseb li.
I must have done something wrong	I għandu għamilt xi ħaġa ħażina
And it’s at work now.	U huwa fuq ix-xogħol issa.
I made sure of that	Jien għamilt ċert minn dan
I don't know.	ma nafx.
I believe you can do that.	Nemmen li tista’ tagħmel dan.
I couldn't understand what happened	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien ġara
I never thought it would happen.	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jiġri.
Still here.	Għadha hawn.
From time to time.	Minn żmien għal żmien.
Nor would it be so difficult.	Lanqas ma jkun daqshekk diffiċli.
I have a lot.	Għandi ħafna.
I'm really happy for you	Jien tassew kuntent għalik
I have to be like everyone else	Għandi nkun bħal kulħadd
Something, everything, well can happen now.	Xi ħaġa, kollox, tajjeb jista' jiġri issa.
Not always, but often.	Mhux dejjem, imma spiss.
Better see this.	Aħjar tara dan.
I really think that's it	Verament naħseb li hi dik
I still didn’t even have a car	Għadni lanqas biss kelli karozza
It wasn’t working for me.	Ma kienx qed jaħdem għalija.
I couldn’t say how much.	Ma stajtx ngħid kemm.
So do we.	Hekk nagħmlu aħna.
I was doing this.	Jien kont qed nagħmel dan.
I was doing too much.	Kont qed nagħmel wisq.
I want to make a good one here	Irrid nagħmel waħda tajba hawn
I don't have time.	M'għandix ħin.
Good job.	Xogħol tajjeb.
I'm sure now.	Jien ċert issa.
I believe that saying nothing is wrong	Nemmen li ma ngħid xejn huwa ħażin
There had to be more than that.	Kellu jkun hemm aktar minn hekk.
The house is yours, and so is everything else.	Id-dar hija tiegħek, u hekk hija kull ħaġa oħra.
I knew I wasn’t ready for it all	Kont naf li ma kontx lest għal dan kollu
I had never thought about it long before that time	Jien qatt ma ħsibt dwarha ħafna qabel dak iż-żmien
Tired like everyone else	Għajjien bħal kulħadd
Everyone knew who he was.	Kulħadd kien jaf min kien.
This is not that book.	Dan mhux dak il-ktieb.
He seemed to have done both good and good.	Deher li għamel kemm tajjeb kif ukoll tajjeb.
It's time.	Wasal iż-żmien.
I had so much not.	Kelli tant pjuttost le.
There were those who had to go when they had to go.	Kien hemm min kellu jmur meta kellu jmur.
I have no idea how I'm going to go about it.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif se mmur dwar dan.
I was going there for me.	Kont sejjer hemm għalija.
I had no idea how I was going to do this	Ma kelli l-ebda idea kif se nagħmel dan
Please, please come for me.	Jekk jogħġbok, jekk jogħġbok ejja għalija.
I thought we did really well.	Ħsibt li għamilna tassew tajjeb.
That was it.	Dak kien.
Not at the back.	Mhux fuq wara.
I make time.	Jien nagħmel il-ħin.
You can see where this is going.	Tista 'tara fejn dan sejjer.
It was just there.	Kien hemm biss.
I can’t take anything more	Ma nista nieħu xejn aktar
And it seems.	U jidher.
We never did well.	Qatt ma għamilna tajjeb.
So were we.	Hekk konna aħna.
I'm fine with all this	Jien tajjeb ma' dan kollu
This is not about it.	Dan mhuwiex dwar dan.
I know you want to be very busy.	Naf li trid tkun okkupat ħafna.
It's just me.	Jien biss jien.
There were no cars.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda karozza.
Not so fast.	Mhux hekk malajr.
I think it's good.	Naħseb li hu tajjeb.
I need to do something.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa.
Like, forever ago.	Bħal, għal dejjem ilu.
I will try to be a good man	Se nipprova nkun raġel tajjeb
There’s a lot out there like that.	Hemm ħafna hemmhekk bħal dik.
Something bad will happen.	Se jiġri xi ħaġa ħażina.
I thought she was doing something else	Kont naħseb li kienet tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra
Have you there.	Ikolli inti hemm.
He definitely wants to talk to you.	Żgur li jrid jitkellem miegħek.
Now I know there are such things	Issa naf li hemm affarijiet bħal dawn
I know you already know that	Naf li inti diġà taf dan
I want to think about this and you	Irrid naħseb dwar dan u int
But he could do it.	Imma seta’ jagħmel dan.
It’s all the same work.	Huwa l-istess xogħol kollu.
I know you are right	Naf li għandek raġun
It wasn’t too bad.	Ma kienx ħażin wisq.
I don’t even know where he is.	Lanqas naf fejn hu.
I know his house.	Naf id-dar tiegħu.
Everyone is great.	Kulħadd huwa kbir.
Maybe harder than ever.	Forsi aktar diffiċli minn qatt qabel.
I would like to talk to you more	Nixtieq nitkellem miegħek aktar
I knew it was coming.	Kont naf li kien ġej.
And we make a lot of money if we do well.	U nagħmlu ħafna flus jekk nagħmlu tajjeb.
This is a difficult problem.	Din hija problema diffiċli.
There may be a chance.	Jista 'jkun hemm ċans.
I enjoy being here.	Jien nieħu gost inkun hawn.
I think they are pretty good	Naħseb li huma pjuttost tajjeb
So we did.	Hekk għamilna.
I can’t wait to see it done	Ma nistax nistenna biex nara dan isir
There is something else.	Hemm ħaġa oħra.
I wanted to, that's for sure	Ridt, dak żgur
I wasn’t doing any of this	Jien ma kontx qed nagħmel xi ħaġa minn dan
All this I did not want	Dan kollu ma ridtx
There was nothing he could do, of course.	Ma kien hemm xejn li seta’ jagħmel, ovvjament.
I didn't say anything	Jien ma għedt xejn
I don’t even believe it	Jien lanqas nemmen
I just need to talk to you	Għandi bżonn biss nitkellem miegħek
I would love to know what's here	Nixtieq ħafna nkun naf x'hemm hawn
There you are.	Hemm int.
I can hear him thinking	Nista’ nisma’ jaħseb
It's not that hard.	Mhuwiex daqshekk diffiċli.
It may be that it will help.	Jista 'jkun li se jgħin.
And so it does.	U hekk jagħmel.
It would have been so easy.	Kieku kien daqshekk faċli.
To go back home.	Biex tmur lura d-dar.
I can’t think otherwise.	Ma nistax naħseb mod ieħor.
I think it looks bad.	Naħseb li jidher ħażin.
It would not have been so.	Ma kienx ikun hekk.
I never thought much about it.	Qatt ma ħsibt ħafna dwarha.
I want to be with him	Irrid inkun miegħu
I understand that	Nifhem hekk
Only you can know that.	Inti biss tista 'tkun taf li.
Dawn.	Dawn.
I was happy at the time	Kont kuntent dak iż-żmien
I’m a little surprised about this.	Jien xi ftit sorpriż dwar dan.
I want your help.	Irrid l-għajnuna tiegħek.
No one told me.	Ħadd ma qalli.
This, right here.	Dan, eżatt hawn.
How scared he was.	Kemm kien ħassu jibża’.
I’m back on the book.	Jien lura fuq il-ktieb.
I’m willing to wait for a better time	Jien lest li nistenna għal żmien aħjar
But he saw only one.	Imma ra wieħed biss.
Don't do it yet.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan għadu.
But not too often.	Imma mhux wisq spiss.
I came back to the car	Ġejt lura lejn il-karozza
I don’t want to wait until we are.	Ma rridx nistenna sakemm aħna.
I was just talking.	Kont qed nitkellem biss.
He didn’t want to go last night.	Ma riedx imur ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
We have to go with him.	Irridu mmorru miegħu.
I think it wasn’t that bad	Naħseb li ma kienx daqshekk ħażin
That too.	Dak wisq.
And never more than now.	U qatt aktar minn issa.
Which is not a bad thing.	Li mhix xi ħaġa ħażina.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
This should not be the case.	Dan m'għandux ikun hekk.
We’ve been doing that for a year.	Għamilna sena nagħmlu hekk.
Everyone wants one.	Kulħadd irid wieħed.
I would be better off too	Jien inkun aħjar ukoll
I haven’t been one for quite some time	Jien ma kontx wieħed għal żmien pjuttost twil
She did it, he did it too.	Hija għamlet dan, huwa għamel dan ukoll.
I was going to do whatever it took	Kont se nagħmel dak kollu li hemm bżonn
I just wanted to talk to him.	Ridt biss nitkellem miegħu.
I think I say so	Naħseb li ngħid hekk
More than bad.	Aktar milli ħażin.
For me, he was just a friend.	Għalija, kien biss ħabib.
I think it will happen sooner or later	Naħseb li jiġri llum jew għada
So be it.	Hekk ikun .
But not now.	Imma mhux issa.
I’ll be home late tonight, or early tomorrow.	Jien ser inkun id-dar tard illejla, jew kmieni għada.
I know you want it that way	Naf li trid hekk
.	.
Everything about it.	Kollox dwarha.
That’s how we know each other.	Hekk nafu lil xulxin.
It's useless for us.	Hu ta’ xejn għalina.
I hope that actually happens	Nispera li fil-fatt jiġri
You are doing this tonight.	Qed tagħmel dan illejla.
Plus it was something else.	Barra minn hekk kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
I didn’t want that	Jien ma ridtx hekk
I need to think of something	Għandi bżonn naħseb xi ħaġa
I was very young	Kont għadni żgħir ħafna
Something is wrong.	Xi ħaġa hija ħażina.
I wanted to go there	Ridt immur hemm
So too, he told me, but not now.	Hekk ukoll, qalli, imma mhux issa.
It came to that.	Wasal għal dan.
You can go to school if you want.	Tista' tmur l-iskola jekk trid.
I can’t do this alone	Ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi
I would.	Inkun.
You might as well think about it so, too.	Inti tista 'ukoll taħseb dwarha hekk, ukoll.
He was the first, but he was not the only one.	Kien l-ewwel, imma ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
This works better.	Dan jaħdem aħjar.
I'm not good.	Jien mhux tajjeb.
Very beautiful thing.	Ħaġa sabiħa ħafna.
He can only go home.	Huwa jista 'biss imur id-dar.
And someone does.	U xi ħadd jagħmel.
I had no idea about that	Ma kelli l-ebda idea dwar dan
Please any help.	Jekk jogħġbok kull għajnuna.
As she knew she always did.	Kif kienet taf dejjem għamlet.
I’m scared of everything.	Jien nibża minn kollox.
I think you are right	Naħseb li għandek raġun
No, no, there is something.	Le, le, hemm xi ħaġa.
I saw nothing.	Ma rajt xejn.
I have a long job.	Għandi xogħol twil.
He said maybe he would.	Qal li forsi kieku.
I can do something for three hours	Kapaċi nagħmel xi ħaġa għal tliet sigħat
I want to be here too	Irrid inkun hawn ukoll
There is so much more to us.	Hemm ħafna aktar għalina.
There is something here that you must see.	Hemm xi ħaġa hawn li trid tara.
I’m sure there has to be something like that	Jiena ċert li jrid ikun hemm xi ħaġa bħal dik
No one had much money.	Ħadd ma kellu ħafna flus.
In fact, I couldn't tell.	Fil-fatt ma stajtx ngħid.
One of three things.	Waħda minn tliet affarijiet.
He didn't tell anyone.	Ma qal lil ħadd.
We just need a little more time.	Għandna bżonn biss ftit aktar ħin.
I do so.	Jien nagħmel hekk.
I'm with a friend.	Jien ma’ ħabib.
I can tell it happened	Nista' ngħid li ġara
He couldn’t do it anymore.	Ma setax jagħmel dan aktar.
I want to know everything about her	Irrid inkun naf kollox dwarha
I knew she knew the whole truth	Kont naf li kienet taf il-verità kollha
It should happen early today.	Għandu jiġri kmieni llum.
I always take a lot of time there.	Dejjem nieħu ħafna ħin hemmhekk.
But no one could be sure.	Imma ħadd ma seta’ jkun ċert.
It was good.	Kien tajjeb.
I was one of them.	Jien kont wieħed minn dawn.
Well, you see.	Ukoll, tara.
It didn’t have to be.	Ma kellux ikun.
I don’t know why you won’t tell me.	Ma nafx għalfejn mhux se tgħidli.
I quite enjoy this.	Jiena nieħu gost pjuttost din.
I need to think.	Għandi bżonn naħseb.
I wasn’t sure why.	Ma kontx ċert għaliex.
I could still tell he wasn't here	Għadni stajt ngħid li ma kienx hawn
For me, it’s better.	Għalija, huwa aħjar.
Not so for everyone.	Mhux hekk għal kulħadd.
I just need to think	Għandi bżonn biss naħseb
This may not be what you want.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx dak li trid.
I want something better.	Irrid xi ħaġa aħjar.
He is coming tomorrow.	Hu ġej minn għada.
You have to do it.	Trid tagħmel.
It takes a lot of time.	Huwa jieħu ħafna ħin.
But this he could not see.	Imma dan ma setax jara.
That was not the way to live.	Dak ma kien mod biex xi ħadd jgħix.
It could have been bad.	Seta’ kien ħażin.
I know what happened	Naf x’ġara
There is something for everyone.	Hemm xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
Only time will tell.	Il-ħin biss jgħid hemmhekk.
Time is time.	Iż-żmien huwa żmien.
I can’t believe what happened	Ma nistax nemmen dak li ġara
That's what happened.	Huwa dak li ġara.
I am very sorry for what happened	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal dak li ġara
Of another.	Ta’ ieħor.
You know how they are.	Taf kif huma.
And he won't now.	U hu mhux se issa.
Both of them.	It-tnejn li huma.
He has to.	Huwa għandu.
I have to know.	Ikolli nkun naf.
But that was then, and it is now.	Imma dak kien dak iż-żmien, u dan issa.
You won't be able to do a little more.	Inti ma tkunx tista 'tagħmel ftit aktar.
Not everyone can do that.	Mhux kulħadd jista’ jagħmel dan.
That time has passed.	Dak iż-żmien għadda.
I couldn’t talk about it to anyone.	Ma stajt nitkellem dwarha lil ħadd.
So she did.	Hekk għamlet hi.
None of these things happened.	L-ebda waħda minn dawn l-affarijiet ma ġara.
I was there, and it didn't happen	Jien kont hemm, u mhux hekk ġara
I didn’t want to think about something bad happening	Ma ridtx naħseb dwar xi ħaġa ħażina li jiġri
Very little indeed.	Ftit ħafna tassew.
I didn’t know she was home	Ma kontx naf li kienet id-dar
He had done well.	Huwa kien għamel tajjeb.
I had my husband.	Kelli raġel tiegħi.
He really felt bad about it.	Huwa tassew ħassu ħażin dwar dan.
I would never do anything like that	Jien qatt ma nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik
I want it to be mine	Irrid li tkun tiegħi
And no time.	U l-ebda ħin.
It just really does.	Huwa biss verament tagħmel.
But once it was something else.	Imma darba kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
But nothing like what is happening now.	Imma xejn bħal dak li qed jiġri issa.
Where she is.	Fejn hi.
I hadn’t told anyone about what had happened yet	Għadni ma kont għidt lil ħadd dwar dak li ġara
That was a problem.	Dik kienet problema.
Well, she knew it wasn’t her.	Tajjeb, kienet taf li ma kinitx hi.
Sure, he would have.	Żgur, kien ikollu.
It was about the same size.	Kien madwar l-istess daqs.
I can't say anything more.	Ma nista’ ngħid xejn aktar.
He was alone.	Kien waħdu.
Really really really hard.	Verament verament verament diffiċli.
I have done this too often	Dan għamilt wisq spiss
I’m not going to say anything.	Jien mhu se ngħid xejn.
So we did a lot.	Hekk għamilna ħafna.
But a long time had passed.	Imma kien għadda żmien twil.
She just hadn’t thought about it at the time.	Hija biss ma kinitx ħsibt dwar dan dak iż-żmien.
He took no money.	Ma ħa l-ebda flus.
No one was surprised.	Ħadd ma kien sorpriż.
Now I can talk about other things	Issa nista’ nitkellem dwar affarijiet oħra
I didn’t expect her to be back so soon	Ma kontx nistenna li tkun lura daqshekk malajr
That would be one thing.	Dik kienet tkun ħaġa waħda.
It's not a man out there who doesn't know what he's doing.	Mhuwiex raġel hemmhekk li ma jafx x’qed jagħmel.
I don't have to worry	M'għandix għalfejn inkun inkwetat
I think it went very well on this.	Naħseb li mar tajjeb ħafna fuq dan.
I can go now.	Nista’ mmur issa.
This is playful.	Dan huwa jilgħab.
I have to eat something else	Għandi niekol xi ħaġa oħra
I needed to know this	Kelli bżonn inkun naf dan
I want to be there	Irrid li jkun hemm
It must come.	Għandu jiġi.
But not now, not now.	Imma mhux issa, mhux issa.
Or is there ?.	Jew hemm?.
That's good.	Dak huwa tajjeb.
I’m glad I said so.	Jien kuntent li għidt hekk.
They were always there for me.	Dejjem kienu hemm għalija.
I just don’t know where to go from here.	Jien biss ma nafx fejn immur minn hawn.
I didn’t know it was so	Ma kontx naf li kien hekk
I think that.	Naħseb li.
I have to take home with me	Għandi nieħu d-dar miegħi
I didn’t do any of these.	Jien ma għamilt xejn minn dawn.
I want it to look beautiful	Irrid li tidher sabiħa
It needs to.	Jeħtieġ li.
I will do this more often	Jien se nagħmel dan aktar spiss
He was right, of course.	Kellu raġun, ovvjament.
I have to try this now!	Ikolli nipprova dan issa!
I have already said too much	Diġà għedt wisq
I make more money than he does.	Jien nagħmel aktar flus milli jagħmel hu.
We are much better than that	Aħna ħafna aħjar minn dan
I was very happy to be with her	Kont kuntent ħafna li kienet miegħi
Something can go wrong	Xi ħaġa tista' tmur ħażin
He sat down like that for what seemed like forever.	Huwa poġġa bilqiegħda hekk għal dak li deher qisu għal dejjem.
I wasn’t sure what to expect.	Ma kontx ċert x'se nistenna.
He will need more.	Huwa ser ikollu bżonn aktar.
I want to talk to you alone	Irrid nitkellem miegħek waħdi
Maybe it’s a little of each of these.	Forsi huwa ftit minn kull wieħed minn dawn.
He was small and beautiful.	Huwa kien żgħir u kienet sabiħa.
But we have none.	Imma m'għandniex l-ebda.
I wasn't sure what to do	Ma kontx ċert x’se jagħmel
I haven't had one in a long time	Ilni ma kellix hekk
I'm sure you have yours.	Jien ċert li għandek tiegħek.
Not too much.	Mhux wisq.
I just want to ask.	Irrid biss nistaqsi.
I had to know that something was really wrong	I kellha naf li xi ħaġa kienet verament ħażina
I did, really.	Jien għamilt, tassew.
I hope you will be so	Qed nittama li inti tkun hekk
I’m really glad you came	Jien tassew ferħan li ġejt
I knew it would, someday	Kont naf li kieku, xi darba
I think you shouldn’t	Naħseb li m'għandekx
I think you see why	Naħseb li tara għaliex
I like to see this.	Inħobb nara dan.
I love these.	Jien inħobb dawn.
I wonder what he will do about it.	Nistaqsi x’se jagħmel dwarha.
I think there can always be a better one	Naħseb li dejjem jista’ jkun hemm waħda aħjar
I had to go back	Kelli nerġa’ nerġa’ għandi
No one knew what to expect.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x'se jistenna.
It's as big as it gets.	Huwa kbir kemm jista' jkun.
I’ve never done anything like that before.	Qatt ma għamilt xi ħaġa bħal dik qabel.
I had one back home	Kelli waħda lura d-dar
I think you can do that	Naħseb li tista 'tagħmel dan
If he survives.	Jekk jgħix.
I've been or something	Stajt ġejt jew xi ħaġa
Both are very difficult.	It-tnejn huma diffiċli ħafna.
I was the same as a boy	Jien kont l-istess bħal tifel
Neither do you.	U lanqas int.
I can wait for a while	Nista' nistenna għal ftit
We are better than that.	Aħna aħjar minn hekk.
I never want to do anything else	Qatt ma nixtieq li tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra
I don't have to talk	M'għandix għalfejn nitkellem
This is who you are.	Dan hu min int.
It's very big.	Huwa kbir ħafna.
Everyone stays out.	Kulħadd jibqa’ barra.
That was too late.	Dan kien tard wisq.
But it was already good enough.	Imma diġà kienet tajba biżżejjed.
Come on boy.	Ejja tifel.
I didn’t want to be alone	Ma ridtx li tkun waħdek
I was going to be tough	Kont se nkun diffiċli
We know enough.	Nafu biżżejjed.
Maybe it will never be ready.	Forsi qatt ma jkun lest.
Too much to say.	Wisq xi ngħid.
U le.	U le.
Obviously, so it happened.	Ovvjament, hekk ġara.
He speaks faster than he thinks.	Jitkellem aktar malajr milli jaħseb.
There is no way that will happen.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li se jiġri.
I hope he does the same for you!	Nispera li jagħmel l-istess għalik!
So I thought.	Hekk ħsibt.
It won’t be long now.	Mhux se jkun twil issa.
You don’t want it to be.	Ma tridx li jkun.
I want to talk to him alone	Irrid nitkellem miegħu waħdi
I still have fun	Għadni nieħu gost
I was trying to do something beautiful.	Kont qed nipprova nagħmel xi ħaġa sabiħa.
He just told me.	Huwa qalli biss.
That was our home.	Dik kienet id-dar tagħna.
But I can’t do that.	Imma jien ma nistax nagħmel hekk.
And it should.	U għandu.
And you can really tell.	U tista 'verament tgħid.
Currently no one seems to be home.	Bħalissa ħadd ma jidher li hu d-dar.
I talk too much at work	Nitkellem wisq fuq ix-xogħol
I want you ready	Irrid li inti lest
Just one more thing.	Ħaġa waħda oħra biss.
And, it was definitely a good idea.	U, żgur li kienet idea tajba.
I'm really not sure why.	Jien verament mhux ċert għaliex.
I think he is right.	Naħseb li għandu raġun.
I wasn’t the only one	Jien ma kontx l-uniku wieħed
I probably won't do it again	Probabbilment mhux se nerġa’ nagħmel
But he went and asked for work.	Imma mar u talab ix-xogħol.
I knew it was a bad idea to come here alone	Kont naf li kienet idea ħażina li ġej hawn waħdi
I'm not afraid	M’għandi minn min nibża’
And not like someone is around to help.	U mhux bħal xi ħadd ikun madwar biex jgħin.
There must be more than that.	Għandu jkun hemm aktar minn hekk.
And it happened.	U ġara.
I was this all the time	Jien kont dan il-ħin kollu
This was our last chance.	Dan kien l-aħħar ċans tagħna.
As it was.	Kif kienet.
I’m very, very good	Jien tajjeb ħafna, tajjeb ħafna
It is.	Li se.
And so do mine.	U hekk tagħmel tiegħi.
So I did once.	Hekk għamilt darba.
And this is a problem.	U din hija problema.
A small child.	Tifel żgħir.
I will not buy anymore	Mhux se nixtri aktar
Maybe it was just him.	Forsi kien biss hu.
Nothing has been done yet.	Għadu ma sar xejn.
It's here.	Huwa hawn.
I was thinking.	Jien kont qed naħseb.
So tired of it all.	Hekk għajjien minn dan kollu.
I never know.	Jien qatt ma naf.
I don’t like it here or there	Ma nħobbx hawn jew hemm
We are sure.	Aħna żgur.
Don't think so.	Ma jaħsibx hekk.
I know I wasn’t.	Naf li ma kontx.
Well now, that's it.	Ukoll issa, dak hu.
I could believe that	Jien stajt nemmen li
And there it is.	U hemm.
And they are as follows.	U dawn huma kif ġej.
I didn't see anything	Jien ma rajt xejn
I didn’t want to love anyone.	Ma ridt inħobb lil ħadd.
The work was either good or bad.	Ix-xogħol kien jew tajjeb jew ħażin.
I'm happy.	Jien kuntent.
We want to know.	Irridu nkunu nafu.
I saw you see me	Rajt inti tara lili
I wasn’t one of those	Jien ma kontx wieħed minn dawn
I would never be good enough for him	Qatt ma nkun tajjeb biżżejjed għalih
I went to school for both of us	Mort l-iskola għalina t-tnejn
He was still with me.	Kien għadu miegħi.
I always thought.	Dejjem ħsibt.
It's just not for me.	Huwa biss mhux għalija.
Many times I thought so.	Ħafna drabi hekk ħsibt.
They are for everyone.	Huma għal kulħadd.
I can be here for you.	Jien nista' nkun hawn għalik.
This happened every time.	Dan ġara kull darba.
Not like there was.	Mhux bħal ma kien hemm.
I couldn't have a baby.	Ma stajtx inkun qed ikolli tifel.
I'm not sure why it's not working.	M'inix ċert għaliex mhux qed jaħdem.
It will definitely be back.	Żgur se tkun lura.
He thought it was so good.	Huwa ħaseb li kien daqshekk tajjeb.
I think it looks good	Naħseb li jidher tajjeb
It was my job to like things.	Kien xogħol tiegħi li nixtieq l-affarijiet.
I know your work very well.	Naf ix-xogħol tiegħek tajjeb ħafna.
For me it was just an idea.	Għalija kienet biss idea.
I couldn’t believe how she looked	Ma stajtx nemmen kemm kienet tidher
I can’t say for sure.	Ma nistax ngħid żgur.
And if not, why not ?.	U jekk le, għaliex le?.
He knew he could do it.	Kien jaf li seta’ jagħmel dan.
I thought quickly.	Ħsibt malajr.
I knew it was for me	Kont naf li kien għalija
He was back.	Kien lura.
I’m not going to go any further now	Jien mhux se mmur aktar issa
More time to think.	Aktar ħin biex taħseb.
It would be good.	Ikun tajjeb.
He is one year old.	Huwa ta' sena.
If there’s anything you want to know, let me have it.	Jekk hemm xi ħaġa li trid tkun taf, ejja għandi.
There they are and we.	Hemm huma u aħna.
But I don’t know how to do it.	Imma ma nafx kif nagħmel.
This does not.	Dan ma.
I love all these things	Inħobb dawn l-affarijiet kollha
Maybe she was just tired.	Forsi kienet biss għajjien.
We will not.	Aħna mhux se.
It was pretty big.	Kien pjuttost kbir.
I want to know about this happening.	Irrid inkun naf dwar dan jiġri.
But it’s not a big deal.	Imma mhix xi ħaġa kbira.
No one else is here for him to come home.	Ħadd ieħor mhu hawn għalih biex jiġi d-dar.
I needed to know what was going on.	Kelli bżonn inkun naf x’kien qed jiġri.
I know where you are	Naf fejn int
Not the same.	Mhux l-istess.
But she is not.	Imma hi mhix.
More than you think.	Aktar milli taħseb.
It happens until it can no longer happen.	Jiġri sakemm ma jkunx jista 'jiġri aktar.
It will take a few more hours.	Se tieħu ftit sigħat oħra.
He said he did.	Huwa qal li għamel.
I got out of there today just before noon	Ġejt minn hemm illum eżatt qabel nofsinhar
That I heard.	Li smajt.
I will do what you want	Jien se nagħmel li trid
You know it’s too late.	Taf li huwa tard wisq.
I had heard otherwise	Kont smajt mod ieħor
But there is nothing more here.	Imma m'hemm xejn aktar hawn.
I'm so sorry to hear that	Jiddispjaċini ħafna li nisma' dan
I was ready, to be sure	Kelli lest, biex inkun ċert
I didn’t know why.	Ma kontx naf għaliex.
That's what we do.	Hekk nagħmlu.
I thought a lot about it	Ħsibt ħafna dwarha
Good to be there.	Tajjeb li jkun hemm.
Friend, who seemed more than a friend	Ħabib, li deher aktar minn ħabib
But a lot is happening.	Imma qed jiġri ħafna.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
He looked small.	Huwa deher żgħir.
Everything works properly.	Kollox jaħdem kif suppost.
Good job, boy.	Xogħol tajjeb, tifel.
You can’t go wrong when you do this.	Ma tistax tmur ħażin meta tagħmel dan.
And it will be soon.	U se jkun malajr.
And, obviously not.	U, ovvjament mhux.
That’s what we were both.	Dak konna aħna t-tnejn.
I doubt it.	Niddubita.
I was hoping to get some tonight	Kont nittama li nieħu xi ftit illejla
No one knows this.	Ħadd ma jaf dan.
I can't do that now	Ma nistax nagħmel dan issa
She is not home.	Hija mhix id-dar.
Well you are not alone.	Ukoll m'intix waħdek.
There will be no other way to do it.	Mhux se jkun hemm mod ieħor biex tagħmel dan.
I would do this pretty quickly if we could.	Nixtieq nagħmel dan pjuttost malajr jekk nistgħu.
I wonder if she would be here	Nistaqsi kieku hi tkun hawn
I think he wasn’t happy	Naħseb li ma kienx kuntent
I didn’t even have to ask	Lanqas kelli għalfejn nistaqsi
I need some time to think	Għandi bżonn ftit ħin biex naħseb
She needed to know.	Hija kellha bżonn tkun taf.
Or your little friend, there.	Jew ħabib żgħir tiegħek, hemm.
Well, we were out, which is great.	Ukoll, konna barra, li huwa kbir.
You will be surprised.	Int tkun sorpriż.
If you really want to.	Jekk verament trid.
You know and this is the first time.	Taf u din hija l-ewwel darba.
Not good enough.	Mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
I'm wrong.	Jien ħażin.
I don’t even understand that.	Jien lanqas dan ma nifhem.
I have problems back	Għandi problemi lura
It's not long before.	Huwa ma tantx qabel.
I can't make my way	Ma nistax nagħmel mod tiegħi
It will not make you money.	Mhux se tagħmel flus.
Not for very long.	Mhux għal żmien twil ħafna.
I have already done so as well	Diġà għamilt hekk ukoll
You are mine.	Inti tiegħi.
I don't have to be here yet	Għadni m'għandix inkun hawn
You, me, everyone.	Int, jien, kulħadd.
I wasn’t ready for that yet	Għadni ma kontx lest għal dan
I have a good one.	Għandi tajba.
I think you better come with me	Naħseb li aħjar tiġi miegħi
I want to do something	Irrid nagħmel xi ħaġa
Not for me.	Mhux għalija.
I think he should be afraid	Naħseb min hu għandu jibża’
Everyone in the back had gone too.	Kulħadd fuq wara kien mar ukoll.
But that was a long time ago.	Imma dan kien żmien twil ilu.
The house is still there.	Id-dar għadha hemm.
They felt something.	Ħassu xi ħaġa.
I am good.	Jiena tajba.
I think I’ve done better.	Naħseb li stajt għamilt aħjar.
He was not entirely alone.	Ma kienx għal kollox waħdu.
It couldn’t have come at a better time.	Ma setax jasal fi żmien aħjar.
I didn't see anyone, I didn't hear anything	Jien ma rajt lil ħadd, ma smajt xejn
It should be the last one.	Għandu jkun l-aħħar wieħed.
I heard more than I saw	Smajt aktar milli rajt
Just a little bit.	Ftit ftit biss.
I knew where he lived, now	Kont naf fejn jgħix, issa
I understand all this.	Nifhem dan kollu.
It's like anything.	Huwa bħal kull ħaġa.
Let's go there.	Ejja mmorru hemm.
I couldn't say anything	Ma stajt ngħid xejn
He seemed to do nothing.	Huwa deher li ma jagħmel xejn.
I don't even know what happened.	Lanqas naf x’ġara.
I didn’t know I was going to be here	Ma kontx naf li kont se tkun hawn
I can only do so much	Nista 'biss nagħmel ħafna
But that was the problem.	Imma dik kienet il-problema.
Probably more often in fact.	Probabbilment aktar spiss fil-fatt.
As it were.	Kif kien.
You are here to stay.	Int hawn biex toqgħod.
I was just surprised	Kont biss sorpriż
You don’t want to know, either.	Inti ma tridx tkun taf, lanqas.
It should be later.	Għandu jkun aktar tard.
I would never do such a thing	Jien qatt ma nagħmel ħaġa bħal din
I'm not so good.	Jien mhux daqshekk tajjeb.
I think you are something else	Naħseb li inti xi ħaġa oħra
I didn’t need to talk.	Ma kellix bżonn nitkellem.
But here it was.	Imma hawn kien.
I can go alone.	Nista’ mmur waħdi.
Something was right.	Xi ħaġa kienet tajba.
I wanted it, whatever it was	Jien ridt dan, ikun x'kien
I said nothing.	Jien għidt xejn.
But we will do well.	Imma se nagħmlu tajjeb.
It may take a little longer.	Jista 'jieħu ftit aktar ħin.
I had no idea it was so small.	Ma kontx idea li kien daqshekk żgħir.
She can't go home.	Hija ma tistax tmur id-dar.
I think he did.	Naħseb li għamel.
I had a way of talking back.	I kellha mod kif nitkellem lura.
I want to go shopping	Irrid immur nixtri
I hadn’t seen it coming	Jien ma kontx rajt li ġej
Everyone died.	Kulħadd miet.
I wait and see how he does	Nistenna u nara kif jagħmel
I couldn’t do anything.	Ma stajt nagħmel xejn.
This happens sometimes now.	Dan jiġri xi drabi issa.
I really don’t know where the time went.	Verament ma nafx fejn mar il-ħin.
I was not eating anything	Jien ma kont niekol xejn
To be there when she needed someone.	Biex tkun hemm meta kellha bżonn lil xi ħadd.
He was there.	Huwa kien hemm.
I heard but I could not hear anyone	Smajt imma ma stajt nisma lil ħadd
I was out there.	I kien hemm barra.
I'm ready for, he thought.	Jien lest għal, ħaseb.
I'll tell you something.	Jien ser ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
I wonder how it will be	Nistaqsi kif se jkun
This must be done.	Dan irid isir.
That’s great, that’s good.	Dak kbir, dak tajjeb.
There was no other.	Ma kienx hemm ieħor.
I couldn't hear anything	Ma stajt nisma’ xejn
You must have seen that.	Inti trid rajt li.
I don't know what's wrong with me	Ma nafx x’inhu ħażin miegħi
I never thought it would be me.	Qatt ma ħsibt li se nkun jien.
I thought they were mine	Ħsibt li kienu tiegħi
It's so big.	Huwa daqshekk kbir.
Which is a bad thing.	Li hija ħaġa ħażina.
I was so scared	Jien kont tant nibża’
A little more, he thought	Ftit aktar, ħaseb
I can understand why.	Kapaċi nifhem għaliex.
Really, it wasn’t.	Tassew, ma kinitx.
I think nothing	Naħseb xejn
I think they are better than each other	Naħseb li huma aħjar minn xulxin
She wasn’t really.	Hija ma kinitx verament.
I don’t know, but it could be.	Ma nafx, imma jista' jkun.
There could be a better way.	Jista 'jkun hemm mod aħjar.
That should never have happened.	Dak qatt ma kellu jiġri.
A man should not be a problem	Raġel m'għandux ikun problema
I think he knew.	Naħseb li kien jaf.
I will try that.	Jien se nipprova dak.
I hope he’s not playing with me	Nispera li mhux qed jilgħab miegħi
As you can tell.	Kif tista’ tgħid.
I know who she is.	Naf min hi.
I didn’t know how to ask	Ma kontx naf kif nistaqsi
Too often.	Wisq drabi.
I'm not going to sit there	Jien mhu se noqgħod hemm xejn
Obviously I like it	Ovvjament inħobb
A few more hours or something.	Ftit sigħat oħra jew xi ħaġa.
Anything can happen.	Jista' jiġri kollox.
I never said anything.	Qatt ma kont ngħid xejn.
There was one way to know for sure.	Kien hemm mod wieħed biex tkun taf żgur.
I want to know exactly who he is	Irrid inkun naf eżatt min hu
I have to go back to school	Ikolli mmur lura l-iskola
I can't say for tomorrow	Ma nistax ngħid għal għada
I can understand that	Nista' nifhem dan
It should be for me.	Għandu jkun għalija.
I couldn’t do it alone	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan waħdi
And passed.	U għadda.
It is making our job much harder.	Qed tagħmel ix-xogħol tagħna ħafna aktar diffiċli.
I was a little too fast	Kont ftit wisq malajr
I need you to tell me everything	Għandi bżonn li tgħidli kollox
It was too late to go back now.	Kien tard wisq biex tmur lura issa.
He just said he did it.	Huwa qal biss li għamel dan.
I know it will happen	Naf li se jiġri
He thought one good one.	Huwa ħaseb tajjeb wieħed.
And there is something else.	U hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
This is who you are.	Dan hu min int.
He’s a boy, after all.	Huwa tifel, wara kollox.
She didn't, of course.	Hija ma, ovvjament.
A little later maybe, but not now.	Ftit aktar tard forsi, imma mhux issa.
I want him to be as happy as possible	Irrid li jkun kuntent kemm jista’ jkun
And maybe not for long.	U forsi mhux għal żmien twil.
I'm having a lot of fun	Qed nieħu gost ħafna
Okay, let’s go.	Tajjeb, ejja mmorru.
I knew what he was doing.	Kont naf x’kien qed jagħmel.
I didn't want anyone to be afraid of me	Ma ridt li ħadd jibża’ minni
We have a lot of time.	Għandna ħafna ħin.
Maybe more, actually.	Forsi aktar, fil-fatt.
You never know until you talk to him.	Qatt ma tkun taf sakemm ma titkellem miegħu.
I have to wait until tomorrow	Għandi nistenna sa għada
He had said nothing more.	Ma kien qal xejn aktar.
So he did.	Hekk għamel hu.
I know what you want.	Naf xi trid.
I was expecting this	Kont qed nistenna dan
You and me.	Int u jien.
Not that you.	Mhux li inti.
I'm all you are	Jien dak kollu li int
Easy to make, easy to eat.	Faċli biex tagħmel, faċli biex tiekol.
I was so.	Jien hekk kont.
I can do about these things	I jista 'jagħmel madwar dawn l-affarijiet
I think that’s how far we’re going to go	Naħseb li sa fejn se mmorru
He was right, of course.	Huwa kien raġun, ovvjament.
Not all, no.	Mhux kollha, le.
I know where I'm going	Naf fejn sejjer
Not good, not bad.	Mhux tajjeb, mhux ħażin.
They have for almost a year.	Huma għandhom għal kważi sena.
I had to say something before	I kellha għid xi ħaġa qabel
Well, not at all.	Ukoll, mhux għal kollox.
I’m sure it’s the same for him.	Jien ċert li huwa l-istess għalih.
This, of course, he cannot do.	Dan, ovvjament, ma jistax jagħmel.
So many years and years.	Tant snin u snin.
It would be difficult.	Ikun diffiċli.
But not for me.	Imma mhux għalija.
I needed to do this	Kelli bżonn nagħmel dan
But it really works.	Imma tassew jaħdem.
I know how well it goes.	Naf kemm imur tajjeb.
I want you to know how to do it.	Nixtieq li tkun taf kif tagħmel dan.
I don’t understand why this is so.	Jien mhux qed nifhem għaliex dan hu hekk.
I’m still friends there.	Għadni ħbieb hemm.
I didn’t even do that	Jien lanqas biss għamilt hekk
Look at something else.	Ħares lejn xi ħaġa oħra.
I believe otherwise.	Nemmen mod ieħor.
She is what she wants.	Hija hi li jrid.
I have to go.	Ikolli mmur.
I think not bad.	Naħseb li mhux ħażin.
I knew it would be good	Kont naf li se tkun tajba
as soon as possible.	malajr kemm jista 'jkun.
I had never seen it like this before.	Qatt ma kont rajt hekk qabel.
I know they actually do	Naf fil-fatt li jagħmlu
He knew something he would.	Kien jaf xi ħaġa li kieku.
I knew he had it for me	Kont naf li kellu għalija
He didn’t want to sit down.	Ma riedx joqgħod bilqiegħda.
Surely he knew before.	Żgur li kien ikun jaf qabel.
This is work.	Dan huwa xogħol.
Very long time indeed	Żmien twil ħafna tassew
I hadn’t seen anyone	Jien ma kont rajt lil ħadd
Never a bad thing.	Qatt ħaġa ħażina.
I'm not good at anything	Jien ma nkun tajjeb għal xejn
I wasn’t ready for that	Ma kontx lest għal dan
That’s really it.	Dak hu tassew.
Only.	Biss.
We want to be here.	Irridu nkunu hawn.
I was still.	Kont għadni.
I knew he wanted to do other things	Kont naf li ried jagħmel affarijiet oħra
Too small.	Żgħir wisq.
I needed to get back to you soon.	Kelli bżonn nerġa’ lura dalwaqt.
It will probably be fine.	Huwa probabbilment se jkun tajjeb.
We will definitely be back.	Żgur li se nkunu lura.
I didn’t have time to ask about it	Ma kellix ħin biex nistaqsi dwar dan
I didn't know what was wrong	Ma kontx naf x’kien ħażin
I would like to know more than that	Nixtieq inkun naf aktar minn dan
I was really trying	Verament kont qed nipprova
I couldn’t believe it would never be the same	Ma stajtx nemmen li qatt se jkun l-istess
You can see it at home.	Tista 'tara d-dar.
I said what he thinks	għidt dak li jaħseb
I really don’t want to know.	Verament ma rridx inkun naf.
She will be there too.	Hi se tkun hemm ukoll.
It was mine.	Kienet tiegħi.
I couldn't see where I was going	Ma stajtx nara fejn kont mort
He said he doesn’t know much about it.	Qal li ma jafx wisq dwarha.
I didn't hear much	Jien ma tantx kont nisma’
I can't believe this.	Ma nistax nemmen dan.
This is a very bad idea.	Din hija idea ħażina ħafna.
I should be happy about that	Għandi nkun kuntent dwar dan
Nothing like this has ever happened to me.	Xejn bħal dan qatt ma ġara għandi.
I can also be there when he does.	Nista 'ukoll inkun hemm meta jagħmel.
I thought this was a good idea	Ħsibt li din kienet idea tajba
That does.	Li jagħmel.
He has money.	Għandu flus.
I couldn't prove it.	Ma stajtx nipprova dan.
I take it all back now	Nieħu dak kollu lura issa
I was always tired	Kont dejjem inkun għajjien
You might as well be.	Inti tista 'ukoll tkun.
About everyone we know was there.	Dwar kull min nafu kien hemm.
I think that’s a great idea	Naħseb li hija idea kbira
I would be telling the truth	Inkun qed ngħid il-verità
He didn’t know much.	Ma kienx jaf ħafna.
I couldn't see very well.	Ma stajtx nara tajjeb ħafna.
I only have a little time	Għandi ftit ħin biss
He didn’t know loved ones.	Ma kienx jaf iħobb.
Or tomorrow morning.	Jew għada filgħodu.
I have no idea what I will do.	M'għandi l-ebda idea li se nagħmel.
You can definitely do that.	Inti tista 'żgur tagħmel dan.
I came to take back what is mine	Ġejt biex nieħu lura dak li hu tiegħi
I did that job and that job is back.	Jien għamilt dak ix-xogħol u dak ix-xogħol qiegħed lura.
In fact, I can hear it now	Fil-fatt nista' nisma' issa
I have the same problems	Għandi l-istess problemi
Where you don't want to be.	Fejn ma tridx li jkun.
I think it should be very fast	Naħseb li għandu jkun malajr ħafna
I expect too much.	Nistenna wisq.
I can’t believe anyone does that	Ma nistax nemmen li xi ħadd jagħmel dan
I couldn't be happier	Ma stajtx inkun kuntent
I know he is telling the truth	Naf li qed jgħid il-verità
But you see, isn’t it.	Imma tara, hux.
What will happen.	Dak li se jiġri.
Nothing bad happens.	Mhu jiġri xejn ħażin.
I want him to know that	Irrid li jkun jaf dan
I shouldn’t be seeing this	M'għandix inkun nara dan
She knew who he was and what he was.	Kienet taf min kien u x’kien.
There are some things that are better without.	Hemm xi affarijiet li huma aħjar mingħajr.
That’s what it is.	Huwa dak li hemm.
I didn't want to	Ma ridtx
He was talking.	Kien qed jitkellem.
I'm just a little.	Jien biss ftit.
Sorry, but you can't.	Jiddispjaċini, imma ma tistax.
As it should.	Kif għandu.
I didn't know how long it would take	Ma kontx naf kemm kien se jibqa’ jagħmel hekk
It would be.	Ikun.
I was hoping to get back to you soon	Kont nittama li jerġa’ lura dalwaqt
He loved it that way too.	Kien iħobb hekk ukoll.
Well, he did well.	Ukoll, huwa għamel tajjeb.
Now that would be something.	Issa dik tkun xi ħaġa.
I wasn’t sure it was a good idea	Ma kontx ċert li kienet idea tajba
Not so long ago.	Mhux daqshekk twil ilu.
And it works.	U jaħdem.
Just looked good.	Biss deher tajjeb.
I can’t understand how this works.	Ma nistax nifhem kif tagħmel dan jaħdem.
Maybe he is, maybe not.	Forsi hu, forsi mhux.
No one knows by whom.	Ħadd ma jaf minn min.
I wonder what happened to me	Nistaqsi x’ġara lili
I only knew what he told me, that's it	Kont naf biss dak li qalli, dak hu
I won’t say much about that	Mhux se ngħid ħafna dwar dan
I can't eat anymore	Ma nistax niekol aktar
I probably won't either	I probabbilment mhux se lanqas
I need to say something soon	Għandi bżonn ngħid xi ħaġa dalwaqt
I don't need these things	M'għandix bżonn ta' dawn l-affarijiet
A child is a child.	Tifel huwa tifel.
It sure is.	Huwa żgur.
He never came back.	Qatt ma ġie lura.
I believe.	Jien nemmen .
It needs to happen.	Jeħtieġ li jiġri.
I have something.	Għandi xi ħaġa.
I thought we might know maybe	Ħsibt li nistgħu taf forsi
But he is not.	Imma hu mhux.
But you are not the same person I was.	Imma m'intix l-istess persuna li kont.
I need to sit down.	Għandi bżonn noqgħod bilqiegħda.
They are just who they are, as you said.	Huma biss min huma, kif għidt int.
I just don’t know who.	Jien biss ma nafx min.
I thought it would be better	Ħsibt li tkun aħjar
I want to know how well he’s doing.	Irrid inkun naf kemm sejjer tajjeb.
I said, maybe tomorrow	għidt, forsi għada
Maybe a lot.	Forsi ħafna.
You do a lot of other things, too.	Inti tagħmel ħafna affarijiet oħra, ukoll.
And no one.	U ħadd ma.
You want to tell me what happened.	Trid tgħidli x’ġara.
I wasn’t sure why he was doing that	Ma kontx ċert għaliex kien qed jagħmel hekk
So she is.	Hekk hi.
Everyone saw what happened	Kulħadd ra x’ġara
I know where he will be.	Naf fejn se jkun.
I have other things.	Għandi affarijiet oħra.
I had no one to go to	Ma kelli lil min immur għandi
He should not be able to buy.	M'għandux ikun jista' jixtri.
This will work for you.	Dan se jaħdem għalik.
He is who we are.	Huwa min aħna.
I had to think of that	I kellha ħsibt ta 'dak
I didn't know when he would do it again.	Ma kontx naf meta se jerġa’ jagħmel.
I need to tell you.	Għandi bżonn ngħidlek.
I knew what he was doing.	Kont naf x’kien qed jagħmel.
I have to do something	Ikolli nagħmel xi ħaġa
I hope the time comes soon	Jien nittama li wasal iż-żmien dalwaqt
I don’t like it now.	Ma nħobbx issa.
I haven't been there in a while	Ilni ma kontx hemm għal xi żmien
That was good.	Dan kien tajjeb.
That’s when it happens.	Dak hu meta jiġri.
That was for him.	Dak kien għalih.
How to do it.	Kif tagħmel dan.
What happened was wrong.	Dak li ġara kien ħażin.
I love how easy it is	Inħobb kemm hu faċli
I needed to talk to you	Kelli bżonn nitkellem miegħek
I wasn't ready yet	Għadni ma kontx lest
I have to tell you we need more time	Ikolli ngħidlek li għandna bżonn aktar ħin
And who can.	U min jista’ jkun.
But it obviously works for him	Imma ovvjament jaħdem għalih
Maybe she's with her husband.	Forsi jiġi ma’ raġel tiegħu.
I know where she is	Naf fejn hi
Everyone could know what was happening, how it happened.	Kulħadd seta’ jkun jaf x’kien qed jiġri, kif ġara.
Nothing to see here.	Xejn x'tara hawn.
I still do that.	Għadni nagħmel hekk.
There he went.	Hemmhekk mar.
I think not at home	Naħseb li mhux id-dar
Really bad time.	Żmien tassew ħażin.
But it's none of my business.	Imma mhu xejn tiegħi.
I know and need to say	Naf u jeħtieġ li ngħid
There he is.	Hemm hu.
I want to think this	Irrid naħseb dan
And you.	U int.
I wasn't even listening	Lanqas kont qed nisma’
I wasn’t there for him	Jien ma kontx hemm għalih
Plus, you might not know why either.	Barra minn hekk, forsi ma tkunx taf għaliex lanqas.
He had seen a few things when he was there.	Huwa kien ra ftit affarijiet meta kien hemm.
Not sure why.	Mhux ċert għaliex.
I didn’t know until much later	Ma kontx naf sa ħafna wara
That’s not the same as talking.	Dak mhux l-istess bħal li titkellem.
He saw nothing.	Ma ra xejn.
I haven't seen anyone there in a long time	Ilni ma nara lil ħadd hemmhekk
Something more is needed.	Hemm bżonn xi ħaġa aktar.
I understand what you are saying.	Nifhem dak li qed tgħid.
I can't think anymore.	Ma nistax aktar naħseb.
It was a little more.	Kienet ftit aktar.
I’m just glad he’s back.	Jien kuntent biss li huwa lura.
I didn’t know you were	Ma kontx naf li inti kont
I hadn’t thought about that	Jien ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan
I know all about it	Naf kollox dwarha
I know you are.	Naf li int.
I just couldn’t hear it that way.	Ma stajtx biss smajt hekk.
I couldn’t think of anything to say	Ma stajtx naħseb xi ħaġa li ngħid
It wasn’t so good.	Ma kienx daqshekk tajjeb.
I just really need to know	I biss verament bżonn inkun naf
He’s wearing too much on a boy.	Huwa wisq liebes fuq tifel.
I didn’t want you to know.	Ma ridtx li tkun taf.
That's what he wants to do.	Dak hu li jrid jagħmel.
And that’s when he saw it.	U dak hu meta ra.
I have to do something about it	Ikolli nagħmel xi ħaġa dwar dan
That's a very good thing.	Dik hija ħaġa tajba ħafna.
I know everyone here	Naf lil kulħadd hawn
This was not a good thing.	Din ma kinitx ħaġa tajba.
I hope there can be someone.	Jien nittama li jista’ jkun hemm xi ħadd.
I was just watching someone.	Kont biss xi ħadd qed jara.
I still didn't know anything	Għadni ma kont naf xejn
Never be.	Qatt ma jkun.
This was not difficult.	Dan ma kienx diffiċli.
I knew she would say so, and she was right	Kont naf li se tgħid hekk, u kellha raġun
It must have been difficult.	Żgur li ġie diffiċli.
I haven't been there in a long time	Ilni ma kontx hemm
I knew a lot of people	Kont naf ħafna nies
He will win, one way or another.	Hu se jirbaħ, mod jew ieħor.
It was hard to know how far to go.	Kien diffiċli li tkun taf sa fejn wieħed imur.
I was someone I loved	Jien kont li xi ħadd iħobb
I'm not ready.	Jien mhux lest.
On mar.	Fuq mar.
I was too busy taking a good time	Kont okkupat wisq nieħu ħin tajjeb
I knew how they were	Kont naf kif kienu
Just as long as you.	Biss sakemm int.
Not a good idea.	Mhux idea tajba.
Unless you did the wrong time.	Sakemm ma tkunx għamlet il-ħin ħażin.
It's here.	Huwa hawn.
I have no idea why there is	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex hemm
I definitely love it	Jien żgur inħobb
And there was something else.	U kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
Obviously we have.	Ovvjament għandna.
You don't have to come.	M'għandekx għalfejn tiġi.
I could see he was trying hard	Stajt nara li kien qed jipprova ħafna
He said something.	Qal xi ħaġa.
Not so much anymore.	Mhux hekk aktar.
I was hoping to be back home now	Kont nittama li issa tkun lura d-dar
I think this happened to me a few years ago	Naħseb li dan ġara lili ftit snin ilu
I can’t do that, not like this	Ma nistax nagħmel dan, mhux bħal dan
She looked bad.	Hija ħares ħażina.
I can do this at home	Dan nista’ nagħmel id-dar
I try to do this quickly.	Nipprova nagħmel dan malajr.
I didn’t know for how long	Ma kontx naf għal kemm żmien
I want to be there.	Irrid inkun hemm.
That's too fast.	Dak malajr wisq.
I didn’t think so.	Ma kontx ħsibt.
I will talk to you shortly	Jien se nitkellem miegħek fi ftit ħin
I should never do that	Qatt ma għandi nagħmel hekk
I thought you were coming to me	Ħsibt li ġejt għandi
I was just a kid being a kid	Kont biss tifel qed tifel
I couldn’t, of course	Ma stajtx, ovvjament
Probably nothing.	Probabbilment xejn.
This is it.	Dan hu.
He’s coming back to me.	Qed jiġi lura għandi.
I didn’t know why at the time.	Ma kontx naf għaliex dak iż-żmien.
I have seen many things	Rajt ħafna affarijiet
No one works here.	Ħadd ma jaħdem hawn.
I want everything you want	Irrid dak kollu li trid
It was something.	Kienet xi ħaġa.
Which he never does.	Li qatt ma jagħmel.
And he was, but he wasn’t, going.	U kien, imma ma kienx, imur.
I could hear but not hear	Stajt nisma imma ma nisma
I’m having a pretty hard time with this.	Qed ikolli żmien pjuttost diffiċli b'dan.
I didn't know what to expect or what to say	Ma kontx naf x’se nistenna jew x’se ngħid
We had more time.	Kellna aktar ħin.
I heard it coming over the house.	Smajt li ġej fuq id-dar.
I couldn't listen anymore	Ma kontx noqgħod nisma’ aktar
But you never know when.	Imma qatt ma tkun taf meta.
I'm not afraid of anyone.	Jien ma nibża’ minn ħadd.
I wanted to see more	Ridt nara aktar
We can do that.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
But surely everyone knows this.	Imma żgur kulħadd jaf dan.
What goes, comes.	Dak li jmur, jiġi.
I would like to go with you	Nixtieq immur miegħek
I never thought I would ask	Qatt ma kont naħseb li nistaqsi
I understand where it comes from	Nifhem minn fejn ġej
It was great for us.	Kien tajjeb ħafna għalina.
That was when a boy became a man.	Dan kien meta tifel sar raġel.
I didn’t know anyone else was here	Ma kontx naf li kien hawn xi ħadd ieħor
I have never been so happy.	Qatt ma kont daqshekk kuntent.
The door will know.	Il-bieb ikun jaf.
I know what you are thinking.	Naf x'qed taħseb.
There was no time to think about it or talk about it.	Ma kienx hemm ħin biex taħseb dwarha jew titkellem dwarha.
I want to be the one for you	Irrid inkun dak għalik
I want to go alone	Irrid immur waħdi
He was so happy.	Huwa kien tant kuntent.
There was nothing else you could do.	Ma kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra li tista’ tagħmel.
But you, I wanted to.	Imma int, ridt.
It wasn’t looking good.	Ma kienx qed jidher tajjeb.
I wasn’t going to take any chances	Jien ma kont se nieħu l-ebda ċans
I think he’s playing with us	Naħseb li qed jilgħab magħna
I hardly had one	Jien ma tantx kelli waħda
I wanted to do the work.	Ridt nagħmel ix-xogħol.
It was there.	Kien hemm.
I didn't want money	Ma ridtx flus
I think he should come with me	Naħseb li għandu jiġi miegħi
You don't have to know.	M'għandekx għalfejn tkun taf.
Well, it could have been too much.	Ukoll, seta 'kien wisq.
Once there.	Darba kien hemm.
I thought it was the last one	Ħsibt li kien l-aħħar
I can't say.	Ma nistax ngħid.
But there doesn't seem to be a way to do that.	Imma ma jidhirx li hemm mod kif tagħmel dan.
I couldn't tell you how	Ma stajtx ngħidlek kif
I didn’t know she was going to do that	Ma kontx naf li kienet se tagħmel dan
It would never have been otherwise.	Qatt ma kien se jkun mod ieħor.
A friend was with me	Ħabib kien miegħi
You won't like that.	Inti mhux se bħal dik.
And she knew it.	U kienet taf.
I was three years old.	Kelli tliet snin.
More than.	Aktar milli.
I have only a few things to say	Għandi biss ftit affarijiet xi ngħid
I was a little surprised but happy.	Kont xi ftit sorpriż imma kuntent.
I'm not saying anything	Jien ma ngħid xejn
I thought for sure it would never happen	Ħsibt żgur li qatt ma jiġri
I will always do everything	Dejjem se nagħmel dak kollu
You don’t have much time.	M'għandekx ħafna ħin.
I have a lot to say about that book.	Għandi ħafna xi ngħid dwar dak il-ktieb.
Never there.	Qatt ma hemm.
I did a lot today.	Għamilt ħafna llum.
And now it happens.	U issa dan jiġri.
I understand you have a following	Nifhem li għandek wara
I didn’t think they were actually going to do that	Ma kontx naħseb li fil-fatt kienu se jagħmlu dan
He came out.	Ħareġ.
It helps a lot around our house.	Jgħin ħafna madwar id-dar tagħna.
She had the same one.	Kellha l-istess waħda.
I know it wasn’t that hard for you	Naf li ma kienx daqshekk diffiċli għalik
This actually happened to me.	Dan fil-fatt ġara lili.
I think about everything	Naħseb dwar kollox
But ready.	Imma lest.
We know who did it.	Nafu min għamel dan.
I didn’t know she had any of these	Ma kontx naf li kellha xi wieħed minn dawn
You’re here, you’re there.	Int hawn, qiegħed hemm.
I already told you what happened	Diġà għedt x’ġara
I was so surprised by this and still am	Kont tant sorpriż b'dan u għadni
I'm not going home tonight	Jien mhux se mmur id-dar illejla
I didn’t even know if it was a good thing	Lanqas kont naf jekk kinitx xi ħaġa tajba
I didn’t get a chance	Jien ma kontx ikolli ċans
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwarha.
Tired of waiting	Għajjien nistenna
They won't do it, here.	Huma mhux se jagħmlu, hawn.
Everyone knows everything about everyone.	Kulħadd ikun jaf kollox dwar kulħadd.
I wasn’t sure what it was	Ma kontx ċert x'kien
Well, not the first time.	Ukoll, mhux l-ewwel darba.
And I did.	U għamilt.
Minix.	Minix.
It needs to be.	Jeħtieġ li jkun.
She was there today.	Kienet hemm illum.
I was staying for a while.	Jien kont noqgħod għal ftit ħin.
This happened to me.	Dan ġara lili.
I knew I wanted to be good	Kont naf li ridt li nkun tajjeb
There was no need to do that.	Ma kienx hemm bżonn li tagħmel dan.
I doubt everything now	Niddubita kollox issa
He had never gone so far before.	Hu qatt ma kien mar daqshekk qabel.
She was beautiful, she was beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa, kienet sabiħa.
glad it’s not just me.	ferħan li mhux jien biss.
It really is.	Huwa tassew.
In fact you can.	Fil-fatt tista '.
Not just one but both.	Mhux wieħed biss imma t-tnejn.
I went to him and said	Mort għandu u għedt
He couldn't do anything to us.	Ma seta’ jagħmel xejn magħna.
It was nobody's house.	Ma kienet id-dar ta’ ħadd.
I was scared for a while.	Kont nibża’ għal ftit żmien.
But I didn't know.	Imma ma kontx taf.
I want you to go with me	Nixtieq inti tmur miegħi
We need something else.	Għandna bżonn xi ħaġa oħra.
Like, really, really good.	Bħal, tassew, tassew tajjeb.
I thought it would always be so	Ħsibt li dejjem ikun hekk
Never do that.	Qatt tagħmel hekk.
This is wrong.	Dan huwa ħażin.
I knew how it was	Kont naf kif kien
Many, only today	Ħafna, illum biss
I will try to do this at home	Jien ser nipprova nagħmel dan id-dar
I think it will be good	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb
Anything can happen.	Jista' jiġri kollox.
No, not even once.	Le, lanqas darba.
It won’t just go away	Mhux se jmur biss
But so is he.	Imma hekk hu.
It will not happen again.	Mhux se jerġa’ jiġri.
But he can't.	Imma ma jistax.
I don’t think this was a good idea.	Ma naħsibx li din kienet idea tajba.
I try to think of something to say	Nipprova naħseb xi ħaġa xi ngħid
He wasn’t here when it happened.	Hu ma kienx hawn meta ġara.
I just need time	Għandi bżonn biss il-ħin
And he would be right.	U kien ikollu raġun.
I want you to be happy forever	Irrid li tkun kuntent dejjem
It looks pretty good.	Jidher pjuttost tajjeb.
He was not coming back.	Ma kienx ġej lura.
So it was done.	Hekk kien sar.
It’s not for you to know, it’s not yet.	Mhux għalik li tkun taf, għadu mhux.
I have to believe that	Ikolli nemmen li
I had no way of knowing	Ma kellix mod kif inkun naf
I’m usually alone here	Jien normalment waħdi hawn
Well more money.	Ukoll aktar flus.
Not so with us.	Mhux hekk magħna.
There you are, you want something.	Hemm int li trid xi ħaġa.
They are back to back.	Huma biex lura għal minn le.
I already know why you came here	Diġà naf għaliex ġejt hawn
I think it would be better if you stay here	Naħseb li jkun aħjar jekk toqgħod hawn
I'm still.	Jien għadni.
I want to be there now	Irrid inkun hemm issa
Too much money, friend.	Wisq flus, ħabib.
He was planning all this.	Kien qed jippjana dan kollu.
I can't take it anymore	Ma nistax nieħu aktar
But not now.	Imma mhux issa.
Everyone wants to be your friend.	Kulħadd irid ikun ħabib tiegħek.
That would be easy too.	Dan ikun faċli wisq.
I can’t do this alone	Ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi
I think he will always stay with me	Naħseb li dejjem jibqa’ miegħi
You are something.	Inti xi ħaġa.
You don't have much.	M'għandekx ftit.
I know he can do more	Naf li jista' jagħmel aktar
I'm thinking about it again	Qed nerġa' naħseb dwarha
I would have told you about it if he had	Jien kont ngħidlek dwarha kieku kellu
I want to go home.	Irrid immur id-dar.
I couldn’t be around anyone	Ma stajt inkun madwar ħadd
I wanted it to be good so bad	Ridt li jkun tajjeb daqshekk ħażin
I know he wants to help	Naf li jrid jgħin
You're supposed to be here.	Int suppost li tkun hawn.
I couldn’t wait to go outside	Ma stajtx nistenna li mmur barra
He said he didn't want one.	Qal li ma riedx wieħed.
You know your job.	Taf ix-xogħol tiegħek.
I hope you can't	Nistenna li ma tistax
It was easy to do.	Kien faċli li tagħmel.
This could not be worse.	Dan ma jistax ikun aktar ħażin.
That was something she had to do.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa li kellha tagħmel.
I didn’t know I was here	Ma kontx naf li ġejt hawn
It was not so.	Ma kienx hekk.
It's for everyone.	Huwa għal kulħadd.
I can't wait to talk to you	Ma nistax nistenna li nitkellem miegħek
I can’t say enough good about it.	Ma nistax ngħid biżżejjed tajjeb dwarha.
I was here to hear	Jien kont hawn biex nisma’
I was still the same	Jien kont għadni l-istess
I didn’t see anyone or anything	Jien ma rajt lil ħadd jew xejn
It probably is.	Huwa probabbilment.
There is nothing like it.	M'hemm xejn bħal dan.
I also knew this was not good	Kont naf ukoll li dan ma kienx tajjeb
I want them to do that	Nixtieq li jagħmlu dan
Some things were too difficult.	Xi affarijiet kienu diffiċli wisq.
There's nothing we can do tonight.	Ma nistgħu nagħmlu xejn illejla.
I think we are late now	Naħseb li aħna tard issa
I can’t believe otherwise	Ma nistax nemmen mod ieħor
It's time to dump her and move on.	Wasal iż-żmien li mmur lura.
He has done this before.	Huwa għamel dan qabel.
I want some time alone with you	Irrid ftit ħin waħdi miegħek
I can come back later	Nista’ nerġa’ lura aktar tard
I thought for nothing more	Ħsibt għal xejn aktar
I still have some time	Għadni ftit ħin
I won't wait any longer	Mhux se nistenna aktar
I can't do that.	Jien ma nistax nagħmel hekk.
He needed that.	Huwa kellu bżonn dak.
I can’t say more about it	Ma nistax ngħid aktar dwarha
They were tired.	Kienu għajjien.
I was worried all the time	Kont inkwetat il-ħin kollu
I say that again.	Jien nerġa' ngħid hekk.
I'm not going to be a problem	Jien mhux se nkun problema
I just loved that.	I biss iħobb dak.
There is something for everyone.	Hemm xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
I want you to be with me	Irrid li tkun miegħi
I wanted to say something, nothing	Ridt ngħid xi ħaġa, xejn
I didn’t know how to tell you	Ma kontx naf kif ngħidlek
But, as you say, you never know.	Imma, kif tgħid int, qatt ma tkun taf.
He had done this before.	Huwa kien għamel dan qabel.
But a lot of fun.	Imma ħafna gost.
You need.	Għandek bżonn.
Maybe so.	Forsi hekk hu.
I want you to say this after me.	Irrid li tgħid dan wara lili.
He was planning to do so.	Kien qed jippjana li jagħmel hekk.
He seems to know his job.	Jidher li jaf ix-xogħol tiegħu.
He had to try.	Kellu jipprova.
I understand your work now	Nifhem ix-xogħol tiegħek issa
Things really got better.	L-affarijiet verament kienu aħjar.
I want to talk to you	Irrid nitkellem miegħek
That was the problem.	Dik kienet il-problema.
It looks really good.	Jidher tajjeb tassew tajjeb.
It was too much.	Kienet wisq.
I was sitting in the back	Kont bilqiegħda fuq wara
You really have to be.	Trid tkun tassew.
I always hoped it would never come to this	Dejjem kont nittama li qatt ma jasal għal dan
It's the only way.	Huwa l-uniku mod.
A few hours ago.	Ftit sigħat ilu.
I don't even understand what's really going on	Lanqas nifhem x’qed jiġri tassew
I’m one, I can’t wait.	Jiena waħda, ma nistax nistenna.
I almost did.	Kważi għamilt jien.
I know you want this.	Naf li trid dan.
Which are quite a few.	Li huma pjuttost ftit.
Not with him.	Mhux miegħu.
If we.	Jekk aħna.
It was just there for me.	Kienet hemm għalija biss.
This should be in the evening.	Dan għandu jkun filgħaxija.
It’s what anyone does.	Huwa dak li jagħmel xi ħadd.
I see that this is not.	Nara li dan mhux.
But I wasn’t me.	Imma jien ma kontx jien.
And that wasn’t the problem.	U dik ma kinitx il-problema.
This was not going well.	Dan ma kienx sejjer tajjeb.
She had many friends.	Kellha ħafna ħbieb.
I think you just want to talk to him	Naħseb li trid titkellem miegħu biss
I wasn’t the only one	Jien ma kontx l-uniku wieħed
He will be home tomorrow.	Hu se jkun id-dar għada.
Nobody knows anything.	Ħadd ma jaf xejn.
I think it's pretty good	Naħseb li huwa pjuttost tajjeb
I can almost see that one	Kważi nista 'nara dak wieħed
I never thought so	Qatt ma ħsibt hekk
And this was not the first time.	U din ma kinitx l-ewwel darba.
I hope not too much	Nispera li mhux wisq
And there is something else.	U hemm ħaġa oħra.
It's too early.	Għadu kmieni.
I said something like.	għidt xi ħaġa bħal.
We had school for three hours tonight.	Kellna l-iskola għal tliet sigħat illejla.
Not until today.	Mhux sa llum.
Something else entirely.	Xi ħaġa oħra għal kollox.
Obviously I did.	Ovvjament għamilt.
I haven't been there in a few years	Ilni ma kont hemm ftit snin
No one else knew.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien jaf.
But you never know what's going to happen.	Imma qatt ma tkun taf x'se jiġri.
That was what happened.	Kien dak li ġara.
He will not be left out.	Mhux se jibqa’ barra.
I think he will win more.	Naħseb li se jirbaħ aktar.
I do something for him, maybe	Nagħmel xi ħaġa għalih, forsi
I know what’s right for me	Naf x'inhu tajjeb għalija
You do what you have to do with me.	Inti tagħmel dak li għandek tagħmel miegħi.
He can prove that.	Huwa jista 'jipprova dak.
But it became what it was.	Imma sar dak li kien.
This may be what you want.	Dan jista 'jkun dak li trid.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
This is now ready.	Dan issa lest.
I hope everything went well	Nispera li kollox mar tajjeb
I know how they are	Naf kif huma
I will be there soon now.	Se nkun hemm dalwaqt issa.
I had an idea what was going on.	Kelli naf idea x'qed jiġri.
I didn’t know they were friends	Ma kontx naf li kienu ħbieb
I can’t talk about it right now	Ma nistax nitkellem dwarha bħalissa
He wanted to do something.	Ried jagħmel xi ħaġa.
And he says no.	U jgħid le.
It's great to be here.	Huwa kbir li tkun hawn.
Good and bad.	Tajjeb u ħażin.
It's probably a beautiful one.	Probabbilment hija waħda sabiħa.
It's that and more.	Huwa dak u aktar.
Now I know he wants this for me	Issa naf li jkun irid dan għalija
It comes alone.	Jiġi waħdu.
I know what you are thinking.	Naf x'qed taħseb.
I don’t know what the exact time will be	Ma nafx x'se jkun iż-żmien eżatt
I wonder why she knows these things	Nistaqsi għaliex hi taf dawn l-affarijiet
I know she knows what's going on	Naf li hi taf x’inhu jiġri
That would have been a long time ago.	Dan kien ikun żmien twil ilu.
I didn’t do anything wrong, here	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin, hawn
There are some problems.	Hemm xi problemi.
He said.	Hu qal.
You can go.	Tista 'tmur.
He will be there.	Hu ser ikun hemm.
I don’t know how much time has really passed	Ma nafx kemm għadda żmien tassew
I know this first	Naf dan l-ewwel
Do you think there would be more.	Taħseb li jkun hemm aktar.
But nothing comes of it.	Imma ma jiġi xejn.
He told me what he needed.	Huwa qalli dak li kellu bżonn.
That was the problem.	Hemmhekk kienet il-problema.
I didn’t want to be in school	Ma ridtx inkun l-iskola
You stand for something.	Inti toqgħod għal xi ħaġa.
It didn’t have to be that way.	Ma kellux ikun hekk.
I have no idea why they do that.	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex jagħmlu hekk.
After a while, she didn’t.	Wara xi żmien, hija ma kinitx.
I know exactly what happened	Naf eżatt x'ġara
I am a very bad person.	Jiena persuna ħażina ħafna.
So are we.	Hekk aħna.
I just thought it was worth a try.	Ħsibt biss li kien ta 'min jipprova.
And that makes things a lot easier.	U dan jagħmel l-affarijiet ħafna aktar faċli.
It seems like what happened here.	Jidher li dak li ġara hawn.
Sooner or later it will do.	Għada jew għada se tagħmel.
Well that's me.	Ukoll dak jien.
There will be more.	Se jkun hemm aktar.
I often thought that one day we would be friends	Ħafna drabi kont naħseb li xi darba se nkunu ħbieb
I don’t think he does	Ma naħsibx li jagħmel
It never works.	Qatt ma jaħdem.
Not like this.	Ma bħal dan.
I believe it is not.	Nemmen li mhuwiex.
You are everything to me.	Inti kollox għalija.
He came back to me.	Ġie lura għandi.
He had a job.	Kellu xogħol.
But he had done none of these.	Imma ma kien għamel xejn minn dawn.
I was going with everything	Jien kont sejjer kollox ma’ dik
Not everyone is capable of doing this.	Mhux kulħadd kapaċi jagħmel dan.
It makes everything so much easier.	Jagħmel kollox ħafna aktar faċli.
I didn’t want to do that	Jien ma ridtx nagħmel hekk
I'm sorry.	Jiddispjaċini.
I was having a little fun with you	Kont qed nieħu gost ftit miegħek
I did the work myself	Jien għamilt ix-xogħol jien
It’s not what you think it is.	Mhuwiex dak li taħseb li hu.
Is it everyone? 	Huwa lil kulħadd?
Now it was still.	Issa kien għadu.
Or maybe there was more to it.	Jew forsi kien hemm aktar minn hekk.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better teacher	Ma stajtx nittama għal għalliem aħjar
That actually works better for me.	Li fil-fatt jaħdem aħjar għalija.
I was doing well on my own	Kont sejjer tajjeb waħdi
Something more.	Xi ħaġa aktar.
I had this happen to me once.	Kelli dan jiġri lili darba.
I couldn't even go to school	Lanqas stajt immur l-iskola
I think it’s good.	Naħseb li hu tajjeb.
This is not it.	Dan mhux hu.
It wasn’t much more than that.	Ma kienx wisq aktar minn hekk.
I will do no more	Mhux se nagħmel aktar
It may help.	Jista 'jgħin.
I was going to go alone	Kont se mmur waħdi
I often say she is not	Jien ngħid ħafna drabi hi mhix
They are doing a lot of things wrong.	Qed jagħmlu ħafna affarijiet ħażin.
I haven’t had a job yet	Jien għadni ma kellix xogħol
That was the truth.	Dik kienet il-verità.
A man, that much was certain	Raġel, li ħafna kien ċert
I had to look at the time.	I kellha ħares lejn il-ħin.
Where is the house ?.	Fejn hi d-dar?.
No, it doesn't work that way.	Le, mhux hekk jaħdem.
He couldn’t see anything or anything.	Huwa ma setax jara xi ħaġa jew xi ħaġa.
I can see that, anyone can	Jien nista' nara li, kulħadd jista'
I'm really happy.	Jien tassew kuntent.
He would have to do that a lot.	Huwa jkollu jagħmel dak ħafna.
He died a year later.	Miet sena wara.
Well, to do that.	Ukoll, li tagħmel dan.
They have been good for so long.	Kienu tajjeb għal tant żmien.
And you’re there with him.	U int hemmhekk miegħu.
I think you know what you're doing	Naħseb li taf x’qed tagħmel
I couldn't believe it	Ma stajtx nemmen li
I was the first.	Jien kont l-ewwel.
I was a pretty good teacher.	Kont għalliem pjuttost tajjeb.
And this is great.	U dan huwa kbir.
He says you better go now.	Jgħid li aħjar tmur issa.
I didn’t even know the truth	Lanqas kont naf il-verità
I hope he doesn’t	Jien nittama li ma jagħmilx hekk
It didn’t have to be.	Ma kellux għalfejn ikun.
I really, really do.	Jien tassew, verament nagħmel.
I didn’t even think to try	Lanqas ma ħsibt li nipprova
I say about three years	Jien ngħid madwar tliet snin
I can do better than that	Nista' nagħmel aħjar minn hekk
I understand you have to do what you have to do.	Nifhem li għandek tagħmel dak li għandek tagħmel.
I shouldn’t have done that	Jien ma kellix għamilt hekk
I just want everyone to sit down first	Irrid biss li kulħadd joqgħod l-ewwel
I hope all is well.	Nittama li kollox tajjeb.
I wonder why he was here	Nistaqsi għaliex kien hawn
I thought I was.	Ħsibt li kont.
I was three hours early	Kont tliet sigħat kmieni
Obviously I would like to know why.	Ovvjament nixtieq inkun naf għaliex.
I expect him to be telling the truth	Nistenna li qed jgħid il-verità
I don’t know, maybe it will take more time.	Ma nafx, forsi jieħu aktar ħin.
I didn't want to hear it	Ma ridtx nisma
Just a little try.	Ipprova ftit biss.
And you don't.	U inti ma.
He knows this.	Huwa jaf dan.
It will not be the last.	Mhux se jkun l-aħħar.
I really didn't want to go	Verament ma ridtx immur
I was so worried	Kont inkwetat daqshekk
And that.	U dak.
I see it.	Nara li.
And maybe it was.	U forsi kienet.
I had to do this just to see	Kelli nagħmel dan biss biex nara
I really did.	Verament kelli.
I shouldn’t be here at all, really	Jien m'għandi nkun hawn xejn, tassew
If you had, you wouldn’t be here.	Kieku kellek, ma tkunx hawn.
Not yet, he thought.	Għadu mhux, ħaseb.
I didn't even know what was wrong with him	Lanqas kont naf x’kien ħażin miegħu
I did this in the evening.	Dan għamilt filgħaxija.
I was doing nothing	Ma kont nagħmel xejn
He has to go.	Huwa għandu jmur.
Who wanted a boy.	Min ried tifel.
And now everything is done.	U issa kollox għamel.
I wasn’t happy about that.	Ma kontx kuntent dwar dan.
Everything will be fine.	Kollox se jkun tajjeb.
I couldn't try anything	Ma stajt nipprova xejn
She wants to go home now.	Hija trid tmur id-dar issa.
'I !.	'I!.
The whole book.	Il-ktieb kollu.
The dog, of course.	Il-kelb, ovvjament.
No, it was about something else.	Le, din kienet dwar xi ħaġa oħra.
He did it all.	Huwa għamel kollu.
I wanted someone else to work with him	Ridt li xi ħadd ieħor jaħdem miegħu
Or we may not.	Jew nistgħu le.
I did pretty well there	Jien għamilt pjuttost tajjeb hemmhekk
I’m thinking of doing work now	Qed naħseb biex nagħmel xogħol issa
Everyone was here.	Kulħadd kien hawn.
I thought it would be great	Ħsibt li jkun kbir
Now, it's too late.	Issa, hi tard.
I knew you were fine	Kont naf li int tajjeb
Before I came here.	Qabel ma ġejt hawn.
As much as possible.	Kemm jista jkun.
Well, not quite anything.	Ukoll, mhux pjuttost xejn.
I hope someday she can do it with everyone.	Nittama li xi darba hi tista' tagħmel dan ma' kulħadd.
I was talking about it, but it wasn’t really there.	Kont qed nitkellem dwarha, imma ma kienx verament hemmhekk.
There was nothing more.	Ma kien hemm xejn aktar.
We were sitting there and it looked like	Konna bilqiegħda hemm u kien qisu
Whenever he speaks he always speaks so.	Kull meta jitkellem dejjem jitkellem hekk.
I didn’t want to or nothing	Jien ma ridtx jew xejn
I wanted to understand that.	Ridt nifhem dan.
Money, money, money.	Flus, flus, flus.
What he did then, he will do again.	Dak li għamel dak iż-żmien, jerġa’ jagħmel, issa.
He says nothing happened.	Jgħid ma ġara xejn.
Better.	Aħjar.
He's worried about something.	Huwa inkwetat dwar xi ħaġa.
I have no idea where	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn
She wants to.	Hija trid.
I didn’t think it would be but it really is	Ma kontx naħseb li se jkun imma tassew hu
Usually, they will do everything but not each other.	Normalment, se jagħmlu kollox imma mhux lil xulxin.
Everything I am.	Kollox jien.
I had a great time.	Kelli ħafna ħin.
I think he needs some time	Naħseb li għandu bżonn ftit ħin
He can't leave either.	Lanqas ma jista 'jitlaq.
But you must know the truth.	Imma trid tkun taf il-verità.
He was a bad person.	Kien persuna ħażina.
He came.	Huwa daħal.
I knew exactly what was going to happen	Kont naf eżatt x’kien se jiġri
I really need to know	I verament bżonn inkun naf
I should probably be so soon	Probabbilment għandi nkun hekk dalwaqt
I couldn't understand	Ma stajtx nifhem
You want to come back to school with us.	Trid tiġi lura l-iskola magħna.
I couldn't believe it could happen so quickly	Ma stajtx nemmen li seta’ jiġri daqshekk malajr
I like it that way too.	Jien inħobb hekk ukoll.
I think it would be nice	Naħseb li tkun sabiħa
I think that’s a good thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba.
First, you do something for yourself.	L-ewwel, inti tagħmel xi ħaġa għalik.
I think he went to your house afterwards	Naħseb li mar id-dar tiegħek wara
I just wanted to think	Ridt biss naħseb
It was all for him.	Kien kollox għalih.
But not as much as you might think.	Imma mhux daqskemm tista’ taħseb.
I would, I would	Ikolli, kieku jien
I don't have to tell you that	M'għandix għalfejn ngħidlek hekk
I can make you a better one	Nista' nagħmel inti waħda aħjar
Above and outside.	Fuq u barra.
You and me.	Int u jien.
And so it had to be.	U hekk kellu jkun.
I never was, nor do I know anyone who lives there	Qatt ma kont, u lanqas naf lil xi ħadd li jgħix hemm
I know you need to do this on your own	Naf li għandek bżonn tagħmel dan waħdu
More so both.	Aktar minn hekk it-tnejn.
You have a way with him.	Għandek mod miegħu.
I couldn’t believe this was really happening	Ma stajtx nemmen li dan kien qed jiġri tassew
I know there is a man	Naf li hemm raġel
It had to be that way.	Kellu jkun hekk.
And a little was.	U xi ftit kien.
I know this is too early to tell	Naf li dan huwa kmieni wisq biex tkun taf
I couldn’t understand how this happened	Ma stajtx nifhem kif dan ġara
Which, it's here.	Li, huwa hawn.
It hadn’t been like this before.	Ma kinitx bħal din qabel.
It came again.	Ġie mill-ġdid.
Who ever thought that a few years ago.	Min qatt ħaseb li ftit snin ilu.
And it's just that.	U huwa biss li.
The house is ours.	Id-dar hija tagħna.
Maybe, maybe not.	Forsi, forsi le.
I had to be thinking	I kellha tkun qed taħseb
And sure, that.	U żgur, dan.
Maybe that’s really what we should be after.	Forsi dak huwa verament dak li għandna nkunu wara.
There is something more out there.	Hemm xi ħaġa aktar hemmhekk.
No one needed to know.	Ħadd ma kellu bżonn ikun jaf.
You never go home, not really.	Inti qatt ma tmur id-dar, mhux verament.
He had done so to his friend.	Huwa kien għamel hekk lil ħabib tiegħu.
I have a lot more to go	Għandi ħafna aktar xi mmur
You can't see anything.	Ma tistax tara xejn.
It could be, he said.	Jista 'jkun, huwa qal.
He said nothing.	Ma qal xejn.
Not sure what's going on.	Mhux ċert x'qed jiġri.
Who would have said something like that.	Min kien jgħid xi ħaġa bħal din.
I wasn't talking.	Jien ma kontx nitkellem.
But very quickly.	Imma malajr ħafna.
I talk to everyone.	Nitkellem ma’ kulħadd.
I was like a child sitting	Kont bħal tifel bilqiegħda
I know what you're thinking	Naf x'qed taħseb
In fact, this was not a bad thing.	Fil-fatt, dan ma kienx ħażin.
Everyone saw what happened.	Kulħadd ra x’ġara.
Not tonight.	Mhux hemm illejla.
I have the same problem	Għandi l-istess problema
I couldn’t believe what I had just seen	Ma stajtx nemmen dak li kien għadu kemm rajt
This is a must have.	Dan huwa għandu jkollu.
Little here, little there.	Ftit hawn, ftit hemm.
I didn’t really need to hear that	Ma tantx kelli bżonn nisma dan
How good you did it.	Kemm hu tajjeb li għamilt dan.
I think there might be someone else	Naħseb li jista’ jkun hemm xi ħadd ieħor
I had no idea he could do such a thing.	Ma kontx idea li seta’ jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik.
It's still there.	Għadha hemm.
I don’t have the time for that.	M'għandix il-ħin għal dan.
I hope nothing happened	Nispera li ma ġara xejn
In fact, you can’t be surprised.	Fil-fatt, ma tistax tkun sorpriż.
I'm yours, and you're mine	Jien tiegħek, u int tiegħi
I want my home.	Irrid id-dar tiegħi.
I don’t think there’s anything wrong with me.	Ma naħsibx li hemm xi ħaġa ħażina miegħi.
I couldn’t do that again	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan mill-ġdid
And it wasn’t just for a few hours.	U dan ma kienx għal ftit sigħat biss.
I can see everyone, you know	Jien kapaċi nara lil kulħadd, taf
I knew nothing	Jien ma kont naf xejn
I want you to tell me	Nixtieq li tgħidli
Okay, he said.	Tajjeb, qal.
I don’t know what it was	Ma nafx dak li kien
I was buying everything	Kont nixtri kollox
Now we’re going to do something you want to do.	Issa aħna ser nagħmlu xi ħaġa li trid tagħmel.
He entered what he had.	Huwa daħal dak li kellu.
I can't see it anymore	Ma nistax nara aktar
What I said.	Dak li għidt.
I wanted to see that.	Jien ridt nara dak.
You will never be home.	Int qatt ma tkun id-dar.
Maybe the only thing.	Forsi l-unika ħaġa.
I really have no idea how	Jien verament m'għandi l-ebda idea kif
I’m not saying any of this is wrong.	Jien ma ngħid li xejn minn dan huwa ħażin.
He looked tired tired.	Huwa deher għajjien għajjien.
They are not.	Huma le.
But all right.	Imma kollox tajjeb.
For a few years.	Għal ftit snin.
Man, now he couldn’t go home.	Raġel, issa ma setax imur id-dar.
He was around for a while.	Huwa kien madwar għal xi żmien.
Now it never would.	Issa qatt ma kieku.
There will, of course.	Hi se, ovvjament.
I can't be alone	Ma nistax inkun waħdi
This work was never done.	Dan ix-xogħol qatt ma sar.
I loved being with him	Kont inħobb inkun miegħu
It was actually beautiful.	Fil-fatt kienet sabiħa.
We have no idea what is going on.	M’għandniex idea x’qed jiġri.
You, of course, want to do as you please.	Int, ovvjament, trid tagħmel kif trid.
This may seem too fast.	Dan jista 'jidher malajr wisq.
But there was more.	Imma kien hemm aktar.
Good not good enough.	Tajjeb mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
I can’t be happier, really	Ma nistax inkun aktar ferħan, tassew
He had a great time.	Kellu ħafna ħin.
I just didn’t say anything.	Jien biss ma għedt xejn.
Likely to do.	X'aktarx li jagħmlu.
Well, if the truth be told.	Ukoll, jekk il-verità tkun tgħid.
He is definitely scared.	Huwa żgur jibża.
I was just wondering	Kont biss nistaqsi
Too much time.	Wisq ħin.
I would like to know more.	Nixtieq inkun naf aktar.
I want to listen.	Irrid noqgħod nisma’.
That was you.	Dak kont int.
It won't be long enough.	Għadu mhux se jkun twil biżżejjed.
But we did and everything went well.	Imma għamilna u kollox mar tajjeb.
I would, but.	Nixtieq, imma.
I want to know how she is	Irrid inkun naf kif hi
He looked small.	Huwa ħares żgħir.
I couldn’t eat.	Ma stajtx niekol.
He was always making time.	Dejjem kien jagħmel il-ħin.
But here’s what we do.	Imma hawn dak li nagħmlu.
Or maybe it would.	Jew forsi kieku.
I know it’s hard.	Naf li huwa diffiċli.
But that came out.	Imma dak ħareġ.
He can’t see everyone to see who came first.	Ma jistax jara lil kulħadd biex jara min daħal l-ewwel.
He really did.	Huwa tassew għamel.
I'm so sorry, people	Jiddispjaċini ħafna, nies
I thought one would be enough	Ħsibt li wieħed ikun biżżejjed
If anyone should have, he should.	Jekk xi ħadd għandu jkollu, għandu.
I do all of these first.	Jiena nagħmel dawn kollha l-ewwel.
I was pretty sure it would be fine	Kont pjuttost ċert li se jkun tajjeb
I can’t take I don’t know	Ma nistax nieħu ma nafx
He never arrives again.	Hu qatt ma jasal aktar.
He had done it.	Huwa kien għamel dan.
I thought maybe it was yours	Ħsibt li forsi kien tiegħek
I don't have a husband.	M'għandix raġel.
I think that says a lot	Naħseb li tgħid ħafna
Each.	Kull.
We were first on.	Konna l-ewwel fuq.
I have no idea who he is	M'għandi l-ebda idea ta' min hu
I have to think.	Ikolli naħseb.
I didn’t think about it	Jien ma kontx naħseb dwar dan
It was easy enough.	Kien faċli biżżejjed.
There may be enough for both of us.	Jista’ jkun hemm biżżejjed għalina t-tnejn.
I want to understand what is happening.	Irrid nifhem x'qed jiġri.
Never ever, actually.	Qatt qatt, fil-fatt.
I hadn’t thought about it that way.	Ma kontx ħsibt dwarha hekk.
Let me say that first.	Ħa ngħid li l-ewwel.
But this does not seem to be easy.	Imma dan ma jidhirx li se jkun faċli.
It started very small.	Beda żgħir ħafna.
But obviously not.	Imma ovvjament le.
I couldn't see who he was	Ma stajtx nara min kien
A little more and she would be his	Ftit aktar u hi tkun tiegħu
I didn’t know what to expect	Ma kontx naf x'se nistenna
Many people were on it	Ħafna nies kienu fuq dan
It should be easy.	Għandu jkun faċli.
I didn’t even know he had	Lanqas kont naf li kellu
You know me.	Taf li jien.
Always have and always will.	Dejjem għandhom u dejjem se.
This is a problem.	Din hija problema.
I couldn't even tell you what was in there	Lanqas stajt ngħidlek x’hemm hemmhekk
Everyone is there.	Kulħadd qiegħed hemm.
I had gone there once	Jien kont mort hemm darba
Whatever it was, it must have been wrong.	Kien x’kien, kellu jkun ħażin.
I knew she had a lot.	Kont naf li kellha ħafna.
For many people, this would have been so.	Għal ħafna nies, dan kien ikun hekk.
A man who has a job is a good thing	Raġel li għandu xogħol huwa ħaġa tajba
No, he wasn't going to.	Le, ma kienx se.
Obviously there was something.	Ovvjament kien hemm xi ħaġa.
I hope you enjoy coming here often	Nispera li tieħu gost tiġi hawn spiss
I was so tired of this.	Kont tant għajjien b’dan.
It shouldn't take too long.	M'għandux jieħu wisq żmien.
Most of all, he wanted to help.	Aktar minn kollox, ried jgħin.
You should not be doing this.	M'għandekx tkun qed tagħmel dan.
It is a very beautiful car.	Hija karozza sabiħa ħafna.
I had to do things	Kelli nagħmel l-affarijiet
There wasn’t a time that wasn’t there for me.	Ma kienx hemm żmien li ma kinitx hemm għalija.
I hope it goes easy for you today	Nittama li llum tmur faċli għalik
I couldn’t tell you any of this	Ma stajt ngħidlek xejn minn dan
Or maybe so.	Jew forsi hekk.
I'm scared.	Nibża’.
And they are much more than that.	U huma ħafna aktar barra minn hekk.
He would not do it again.	Ma kienx se jerġa’ jagħmel.
I wanted to be out of here	Ridt inkun barra minn hawn
I hope he hasn’t already left	Nispera li ma jkunx diġà telaq
I need to understand what’s going on	Għandi bżonn nifhem x'inhu jiġri
I was already pretty sure but not sure who	Diġà kont pjuttost ċert imma ma kontx ċert min
It's just small.	Huwa biss żgħir.
They are not just his friends.	Huma mhux biss ħbieb tiegħu.
I can expect a little more	Nista' nistenna ftit aktar
He doesn’t know how good he is.	Ma jafx kemm hu tajjeb.
I heard and said nothing	Smajt u ma għedt xejn
I’ve never been good enough	Qatt ma kont tajjeb biżżejjed
I wish it was otherwise	Nixtieq li kien mod ieħor
A man could only take that much	Raġel seta’ jieħu daqshekk biss
Obviously now we are both the same.	Ovvjament issa aħna t-tnejn l-istess.
I can’t believe you came for me	Ma nistax nemmen li ġejt għalija
There is no way he can take back what has just happened.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li jista' jieħu lura dak li għadu kif ġara.
Le, ra.	Le, ra.
Maybe nothing.	Forsi xejn.
And well you don’t.	U tajjeb m'għandekx.
Sometimes it is.	Xi drabi huwa.
I can’t believe you did this to me	Ma nistax nemmen li għamilt dan lili
We can do the same here.	Nistgħu nagħmlu l-istess hawn.
He had a job for me.	Kellu xogħol għalija.
I have to wait until tomorrow	Irrid nistenna sa għada
I didn't need anything else	Ma kelli bżonn xi ħaġa oħra
It’s the same way with us.	Huwa l-istess mod magħna.
And she is beautiful.	U hi sabiħa.
I can't tell you anymore	Ma nistax ngħidlek aktar
Try it.	Ipprova.
Now she had to do something.	Issa kellha tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I am now.	Jien issa.
I was really surprised	Kont verament sorpriż
It was always evening.	Kien dejjem filgħaxija.
No one had more.	Ħadd ma kellu aktar.
I want to understand why	Irrid nifhem għaliex
He’s definitely trying to do too much.	Huwa żgur li qed jipprova jagħmel wisq.
I just want to be okay	Irrid biss li tkun tajjeb
I didn’t know I was thinking about it	Ma kontx naf li kont qed taħseb dwar dan
He will never go back.	Qatt mhu se jmur lura.
I wasn’t ready to know	Ma kontx lest li nkun naf
Now let me tell you something.	Issa ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
And you do it very well.	U tagħmel dan tajjeb ħafna.
I have never seen the same	Qatt ma rajt l-istess
It was just.	Kien biss.
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi le.
Maybe no one knew who he was.	Forsi ħadd ma kien jaf min kien.
I think this is a good idea.	Naħseb li din hija idea tajba.
I probably will always be	Probabbilment dejjem se nkun
And so it was, if that's what I was after.	U hekk kien, jekk dan huwa dak li kont wara.
If that's what you want.	Jekk dak hu li trid.
I stay here with you.	Jien noqgħod hawn miegħek.
I want one thing and only one thing	Irrid ħaġa waħda u ħaġa waħda biss
You can only do this on your own.	Tista 'biss tagħmel dan waħdek.
Not long ago.	Mhux twil ilu.
It may take a while.	Jista' jieħu ftit.
This happens from time to time.	Dan jiġri minn żmien għal żmien.
I don’t want to do these things	Ma rridx nagħmel dawn l-affarijiet
You are not doing this now.	Mhux qed tagħmel dan issa.
I couldn't be sure.	Ma stajtx inkun ċert.
But I don’t know how to do it.	Imma ma nafx kif nagħmel.
He can leave tonight.	Jista’ jitlaq illejla.
Good, good, good.	Tajjeb, tajjeb, tajjeb.
This is happening.	Dan qed jiġri.
I wasn’t doing well.	Jien ma kontx sejjer tajjeb.
Maybe it wasn't.	Forsi ma kienx.
She knew he was right, of course.	Kienet taf li kellu raġun, ovvjament.
You have to see someone.	Għandek tara xi ħadd.
I'm not sure.	M'inix ċert.
She is one of ours.	Hija waħda minn tagħna.
Just about anything will do.	Biss dwar xi ħaġa se tagħmel.
I'm not ready.	Jien mhux lest.
Nobody told me.	Ħadd ma qalli.
It is very difficult to see.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna biex tara.
But this is wrong.	Imma dan huwa ħażin.
From a year ago.	Minn sena ilu.
This can be both good and bad.	Din tista’ tkun kemm ħaġa tajba kif ukoll ħażina.
I was young, and I needed work	Kont żgħir, u kelli bżonn ix-xogħol
They were useless.	Kienu ta’ xejn.
It was an easy thing to do.	Kienet ħaġa faċli li tagħmel.
It was a car.	Kienet karozza.
I know how well it goes	Naf kemm imur tajjeb
But too fast.	Imma malajr wisq.
That's what happened.	Huwa dak li ġara.
I’m not so bad either.	Jien lanqas daqshekk ħażin.
I would like to go home too	Nixtieq immur id-dar ukoll
That’s not enough for me.	Dan mhux biżżejjed għalija.
I hear you can come home soon	Nisma’ li tista’ tiġi d-dar dalwaqt
I didn’t think anything about it.	Kont ma naħseb xejn dwarha.
It's at work.	Huwa fuq ix-xogħol.
I’ve heard enough.	Smajt biżżejjed.
I think he was doing something else entirely	Naħseb li kien qed jagħmel xi ħaġa oħra għal kollox
That's where it started.	Hemmhekk beda.
Just very bad and bad and not good.	Biss ħażin ħafna u ħażin u mhux tajjeb.
But he wants to think about coming back.	Imma jrid jaħseb biex jerġa’ lura.
I didn’t have time for this tonight	Ma kellix ħin għal dan illejla
We can't.	Ma nistgħux.
It's one of a few.	Huwa wieħed minn ftit.
Many people like this.	Ħafna nies bħal dan.
I would also like some things	Nixtieq ukoll xi affarijiet
I just wanted to go outside.	Jien biss ridt barra.
I thought everything would be fine	Ħsibt li kollox kien se jkun tajjeb
I had to do the same thing I did.	Kelli nagħmel l-istess ħaġa jien.
I thought, nothing really	Ħsibt, xejn verament
I need time to think about this	Għandi bżonn iż-żmien biex naħseb dwar dan
First time for that, for him.	L-ewwel darba għal dak, għalih.
I want to say more about that house	Irrid ngħid aktar dwar dik id-dar
I knew you were, you were	Kont naf li int kont, int kont
One that has done for years and years.	Waħda li għamlet għal snin u snin.
There was someone else.	Kien hemm xi ħadd ieħor.
I hope everything went well	Nispera li kollox kien sejjer tajjeb
They were doing what he asked.	Kienu jagħmlu dak li talab.
I think you should do it	Naħseb li għandek tagħmel dan
I wonder why he does that	Nistaqsi għaliex jagħmel dan
I’m the only one who can do that.	Jien l-uniku wieħed li jista 'jagħmel dan.
I thought I was something else	Ħsibt li kont xi ħaġa oħra
I didn’t know I was going to do it now	Ma kontx naf li kont se tagħmel dan issa
It won’t be the same tomorrow.	Mhux se jkun l-istess għada.
And he had to have.	U kellu jkollu.
Now, none of this is going to be easy.	Issa, xejn minn dan mhu se jkun faċli.
Why.	Għaliex .
He didn’t need to.	Ma kellux bżonn.
I never knew what would happen next.	Qatt ma kont taf x’kien se jiġri wara miegħu.
This seemed a bit much.	Dan deher daqsxejn ħafna.
It’s a lot for one man.	Huwa ħafna għal raġel wieħed.
It’s too early.	Għadu kmieni wisq.
It was a big problem.	Kienet problema kbira.
I'll be right back soon.	Dalwaqt se nerġa’ nkun tajjeb.
I have no idea how long it is	M'għandi l-ebda idea kemm hu twil
She is quite a person.	Hija pjuttost persuna.
I tell you everything	Ngħidlek kollox
It could have been someone.	Seta’ kien xi ħadd.
I know nothing about it	Jien ma naf xejn dwarha
Or, it happens quickly.	Jew, jiġri malajr.
I need to come home right after school tomorrow	Għandi bżonn li tiġi d-dar eżatt wara l-iskola għada
I have to believe that	Ikolli nemmen li
I’ll tell you why I couldn’t	Jien ngħidlek għaliex ma setax
She can’t take on anything anymore.	Hija ma tistax tieħu fuq xejn aktar.
A little more thought.	Ftit ieħor ħaseb.
Great idea.	Idea kbira.
Say nothing.	Tgħid xejn.
I can do it on my own	Kapaċi nagħmel id-dar waħdi
I don’t want to wait, either.	Ma rridx nistenna, lanqas.
I don't know exactly what you're doing.	Ma nafx eżatt x’qed tagħmel.
This is not about it.	Dan mhux dwar dan.
He had done this often.	Huwa kien għamel dan spiss.
He knows so much.	Huwa jaf daqshekk.
I’ll have to think about it for a while	Ikolli naħseb dwarha għal ftit żmien
It's so good to see.	Huwa daqshekk tajjeb biex tara.
I may be out too soon	Nista 'nkun barra qabel wisq żmien
But we know.	Imma nafu.
And that makes my job a lot easier.	U dan jagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi ħafna aktar faċli.
I also have fun.	Jien ukoll nieħu gost.
Not the first time this has happened.	Mhux l-ewwel darba li ġara.
You may want to do this.	Inti tista 'tixtieq tagħmel dan.
I go here.	Immur hawn.
And she wasn’t the only one.	U ma kinitx l-unika waħda.
I wanted him to be with me	Ridt li jkun miegħi
It's all together.	Huwa kollox flimkien.
Wherever you go.	Fejn tmur.
Someone is doing this.	Xi ħadd qed jagħmel dan.
It was probably too late now.	Probabbilment issa kien tard wisq.
I just need a little more time	Għandi bżonn biss ftit aktar ħin
I just wanted to know a few things about it.	Ridt biss li tkun taf ftit affarijiet dwarha.
I want to think about that	Irrid naħseb fuq dan
I know what happened.	Naf x’ġara.
I heard what happened	Smajt x’ġara
She wants to know what happened.	Hija trid tkun taf x'ġara.
I'm sure it will.	Jien ċert li se.
I really have no idea.	Jien verament m'għandi l-ebda idea.
And so we will do today.	U hekk se nagħmlu llum.
I thought it was him	Ħsibt li kien hu
But she will not go back.	Imma hi mhux se tmur lura.
I'm with you.	Jien miegħek.
The, the.	Le, le.
I'm sure it's good	Jien ċert li hu tajjeb
It's nothing but.	Huwa xejn imma.
'for'.	'għal'.
I see how they do the same thing	Nara kif jagħmlu l-istess ħaġa
I know just that, too	Naf biss dik, ukoll
Usually this was not something she was doing.	Normalment din ma kinitx xi ħaġa li kienet tagħmel.
I’m sure it’s nothing	Jiena ċert li mhu xejn
You were right about me not being very good.	Kellek raġun dwar li jien ma tantx tajjeb.
Only one to the end.	Wieħed biss sa l-aħħar.
It didn't look right.	Ma deherx tajjeb.
I knew it could only be one thing	Kont naf li tista’ tkun ħaġa waħda biss
I was doing too much	Kont qed nagħmel wisq
I don't want any more.	Ma rridx aktar.
I didn't need anyone	Ma kelli bżonn lil ħadd
I know how this happened	Naf kif ġara dan
It wasn’t hard.	Ma kienx diffiċli.
Not so great ?.	Mhux daqshekk kbir?.
Like many things.	Bħal ħafna affarijiet.
I need a lot of work	Għandi bżonn kbir ta’ xogħol
Just trying to help.	Jipprova biss jgħin.
It wasn't much work, really.	Ma tantx kien xogħol, tassew.
No, not happy.	Le, mhux kuntent.
I had one last chance	Jien kont l-aħħar ċans
I knew it	Jien kont naf li
I had done so once	Jien kont għamilt hekk darba
Well, no more.	Ukoll, mhux aktar.
And no one went.	U ħadd ma mar.
I want more people to do that.	Nixtieq li aktar nies jagħmlu dan.
You think it’s going to be a big deal.	Taħseb li se tkun xi ħaġa kbira.
I never wanted this house	Jien qatt ma ridt din id-dar
I can’t tell you why right now	Ma nistax ngħidlek għaliex bħalissa
I was too young to understand what had happened	Kont żgħir wisq biex nifhem x’kien ġara
This leaves again.	Dan jitlaq mill-ġdid.
He made one.	Huwa għamel wieħed.
I didn’t think it was going to be that long	Ma kontx naħseb li se jkun daqshekk twil
In fact he was a good man.	Fil-fatt kien raġel tajjeb.
This could be you.	Dan jista 'jkun int.
I was almost too scared to ask	Kważi kont nibża’ wisq biex nistaqsi
You should be happy about it.	Għandek tkun kuntent dwar dan.
Nothing was going to happen.	Xejn kien se jiġri.
I was trying to understand	Kont qed nipprova nifhem
Probably both of us.	Probabbilment aħna t-tnejn.
I’ve always been that way.	Jien dejjem kont hekk.
I have had it many times	Kelli ħafna darba
I will do as he asks	Se nagħmel kif talab hu
But stay for a while.	Imma toqgħod għal ftit.
Someone else will.	Xi ħadd ieħor se.
I've tried.	Stajt nipprova.
Everything had gone well with him.	Kollox kien mar tajjeb miegħu.
I pretty much know that	Jien pjuttost naf li
It's too big.	Huwa kbir wisq.
Just not sure what that will be.	Biss mhux ċert x'se jkun dak.
Maybe it was so.	Forsi kien hekk.
I don’t know how it was	Ma nafx kif kien
And you don't want to do that.	U inti ma tridx tagħmel dan.
I was late but here it was.	Kont tard imma hawn kien.
You want to do something for me.	Trid tagħmel xi ħaġa għalija.
I'm afraid that won't be enough either	Nibża’ li lanqas dan mhux se jkun biżżejjed
I was just a kid.	Kont biss tifel.
I'm trying to see.	Qed nipprova nara.
You, if need be.	Int, jekk ikun hemm bżonn.
I'm ready to talk.	Jien lest nitkellem.
He was a good boy.	Kien tifel tajjeb.
This can all be the case.	Dan kollu jista’ jkun hekk.
But nothing happens.	Imma ma jiġri xejn.
I’m not just saying this.	Mhux jien ngħid dan biss.
But I never saw anyone there	Imma qatt ma rajt lil ħadd hemmhekk
He had never done so before.	Qatt ma kien għamel hekk qabel.
I had thought about this before now	I kellha ħsibt dwar dan qabel issa
I need to do this myself	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan jien
I really can’t say much more than that	Verament ma nistax ngħid ħafna aktar minn hekk
I thought it was really hard	Ħsibt li kienet tassew diffiċli
I thought I was someone else	Ħsibt li kont xi ħadd ieħor
I want to be alone for a while	Irrid inkun waħdi għal ftit
I couldn’t before.	Ma stajtx qabel.
Time only says, of course.	Iż-żmien biss jgħid, ovvjament.
Or better yet.	Jew aħjar kienet sa issa.
He needed to be outside.	Huwa kellu bżonn ikun barra.
I just want to be.	Irrid inkun biss.
That works very well.	Li jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
He wants me.	Irid lili.
It seems to work well sometimes.	Jidher li jaħdem tajjeb xi drabi.
And there was another problem besides that.	U kien hemm problema oħra barra minn hekk.
I know a lot of things	Naf ħafna affarijiet
I can’t believe we can’t do anything about it	Ma nistax nemmen li ma nistgħux nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwarha
I can't think.	Ma nistax naħseb.
He’s not so bad.	Hu mhux daqshekk ħażin.
I had to know how it was going	Kelli nkun naf kif kien sejjer
And she will be.	U hi se tkun.
I need to be you	Għandi bżonn li tkun int
I will probably come back to this again.	Probabbilment se nerġa' nerġa' lura għal dan.
It's pretty easy.	Huwa pjuttost faċli.
He said he couldn’t.	Qal li ma setax.
I have an account and everything.	Għandi kont u kollox.
I’m sorry, but it’s happening.	Jiddispjaċini, imma qed jiġri.
Who do you want to talk to? 	Lil min tixtieq titkellem?
I never wondered.	Qatt ma kont nistaqsi.
He has never been a person who talks a lot at work.	Qatt ma kien persuna li jitkellem ħafna fuq ix-xogħol.
And she was his.	U hi kienet tiegħu.
Little here and little there	Ftit hawn u ftit hemm
It was happening a lot.	Kien qed jiġri ħafna.
I did something today	Għamilt xi ħaġa llum
I didn’t think she was going to be able to do that	Ma kontx naħseb li kienet se tkun kapaċi tagħmel dan
I want to know what she wants	Irrid inkun naf xi trid hi
It never worked.	Qatt ma kien jaħdem.
I didn’t expect him to say so	Ma kontx nistenna li jgħid hekk
It wasn’t that big.	Ma kienx daqshekk kbir.
I didn’t want to do anything wrong.	Ma ridtx nagħmel xejn ħażin.
he said.	hu qal.
This probably won’t happen.	Dan probabbilment mhux se jiġri.
But that’s not what happened.	Imma dan mhux dak li ġara.
Maybe not much, but.	Forsi mhux ħafna, imma .
Say nothing.	Tgħid xejn.
Sorry for that	Jiddispjaċini għalih
I think it would be almost a year ago now	Naħseb li jkun kważi sena ilu issa
A man worried about appearances	Raġel inkwetat milli jidher
Or after you have been.	Jew wara li tkun ġejt.
I can't believe that	Ma nistax nemmen li
I was glad I finished	Kont ferħan li lest
There was no time to plan.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda ħin biex tippjana.
They do what they do.	Huma jagħmlu dak li jagħmlu.
I'll talk about the book again soon	Dalwaqt se nerġa’ nitkellem dwar il-ktieb
I can't say what you're thinking	Ma nistax ngħid x'qed taħseb
I was a little surprised	Kont xi ftit sorpriż
I went to the door	Jien mort lejn il-bieb
You are there.	Int hemm.
I didn't say anything	Jien ma għedt xejn
That was the problem, of course.	Dik kienet il-problema, ovvjament.
I thought you were my friend	Ħsibt li inti ħabib tiegħi
And so it is.	U hekk hu.
It was a lot of trying.	Kien jipprova ħafna.
That's a lot of people.	Dak huwa ħafna nies.
I'm too young.	Jien żgħir wisq.
I think that can happen	Naħseb li jista' jasal daqshekk
I'm just saying.	Jien biss ngħid.
I don’t usually talk like that.	Normalment ma nitkellem hekk.
I’m sorry to ever do that.	Jiddispjaċini li nagħmel dan qatt.
I was going to say please	Kont se ngħid jekk jogħġbok
I have no idea where it is going	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn se tmur
There wasn’t that much, but it was something.	Ma kienx hemm daqshekk, imma kienet xi ħaġa.
It’s right behind me.	Huwa eżatt wara lili.
I could never do that	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel hekk
And there it was.	U hemm kien.
I think he might be back	Naħseb li jista 'jkun lura
It's there now.	Huwa hemmhekk issa.
How much I saw and heard things	Kemm rajt u smajt affarijiet
I still have this problem	Għadni għandi din il-problema
I can see this from here.	Dan nista' nara minn hawn.
I had everything to myself.	Kelli kollox għalija.
Maybe it was the same one.	Forsi kienet l-istess waħda.
I want him to say something, nothing	Nixtieq li jgħid xi ħaġa, xejn
Always said so.	Dejjem qal hekk.
Bad for us.	Ħażin għalina.
But there is one thing you can do.	Imma hemm ħaġa waħda li tista 'tagħmel.
I was wondering about it today	Jien kont qed nistaqsi dwarha llum
I think it could be something else	Naħseb li tista' tkun xi ħaġa oħra
This would be much harder now.	Dan ikun ħafna aktar diffiċli issa.
That would go first, actually.	Dik kienet tmur l-ewwel, fil-fatt.
Please, let's.	Jekk jogħġbok, ejja.
I can do anything here	Jien nista' nagħmel xi ħaġa hawn
fi.	fi.
It's who they are.	Huwa min huma.
I was thinking about something else	Kont qed naħseb dwar xi ħaġa oħra
You want to see everything.	Trid tara kollox.
No, not so much like this.	Le, mhux daqshekk bħal dan.
But don’t eat anything.	Imma ma tiekol xejn.
I wanted to tell you.	Ridt ngħidlek.
I think about things	Naħseb dwar l-affarijiet
Good for you.	Tajjeb għalik.
I never thought it was	Qatt ma ħsibt li kien hekk
I didn’t want to be like that.	Ma ridtx tkun hekk.
He came here to be seen here.	Ġie hawn hekk biex ikun jista’ jidher hawn.
In fact, we can do better than that.	Fil-fatt, nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar minn hekk.
It can be seen from everyone that.	Jista 'jidher minn kulħadd li.
I wasn't expecting it	Ma kontx qed nistenna
Together or not.	Flimkien jew le.
A good one, it seems	Waħda tajba, milli jidher
That was not enough.	Dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
It wasn't working.	Ma kienx qed jaħdem.
Anyone interested in going ?.	Xi ħadd interessat li jmur?.
There may be more to where this came from.	Jista' jkun hemm aktar minn fejn ġie dan.
He was happy.	Kien kuntent.
No one will return to him.	Ħadd mhu se jerġa’ lura għandu.
I have seen enough.	Rajt biżżejjed.
But there is nothing for you here.	Imma m'hemm xejn għalik hawn.
I had never seen anything like it before	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa bħal dik qabel
She was going to do it.	Kienet se tagħmel dan.
I didn’t want to love anyone	Ma ridt inħobb lil ħadd
Not for us.	Mhux għalina.
The first very often.	L-ewwel ħafna ħafna drabi.
I wish I never would	Nixtieq li qatt ma se
I buy here every now and then	Nixtri hawn kull tant żmien
And maybe it was, just a little bit.	U forsi kien, ftit biss.
I was good at one thing and only one thing	Kont tajjeb għal ħaġa waħda u ħaġa waħda biss
Try another.	Ipprova ieħor.
Well, not much.	Ukoll, mhux ħafna.
It really didn’t make for him to appear here.	Tassew ma kienx jagħmel għalih li jidher hawn.
I hope we had more time	Jien nittama li kellna aktar ħin
It's something more.	Huwa xi ħaġa aktar.
She is who she is and he is who she is.	Hi min hi u hu min hu.
I just knew you had to be back	Kont naf biss li għandek tkun lura
It wasn’t easy for me.	Ma kienx faċli għalija.
But this never happened.	Imma dan qatt ma ġara.
Not from me, you won't.	Mhux minni, inti mhux se.
I think she was doing that.	Naħseb li kienet tagħmel hekk.
I thought something was wrong.	Ħsibt li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
He couldn’t have.	Ma setax ikollu.
Not that fast.	Mhux dan malajr.
I can’t think of more about it	Ma nistax naħseb aktar dwarha
There could be something more to that.	Jista 'jkun hemm xi ħaġa aktar għal dak.
We want to be.	Irridu nkunu.
Loved talking.	Iħobb jitkellem.
But for something else.	Imma għal xi ħaġa oħra.
I had to say something	Kelli ngħid xi ħaġa
I've always been like that	Dejjem kont hekk
I don’t know how you think enough to say.	Ma nafx kif taħseb biżżejjed biex tgħid.
I didn’t know it was going to be so great for you	Ma kontx naf li se tkun daqshekk kbira għalik
I never had a chance	Jien qatt ma kelli ċans
I was.	Kont inkun.
I understand where it comes from	Nifhem minn fejn ġej
I want to see what it looks like	Irrid nara kif jidher
No one ever had it.	Ħadd qatt ma kellu.
Top on top on top.	Fuq fuq fuq fuq.
Now she knew it wasn’t going to happen.	Issa kienet taf li mhux se jiġri.
I had something else	Kelli xi ħaġa oħra
I can’t doubt it anymore.	Ma nistax niddubita aktar.
I don't have much time	M'għandix żmien twil
It's just.	Huwa biss.
I was worried about that	Kont inkwetat dwar dan
I just had to not think about it.	Kelli biss ma naħsibx dwarha.
I didn’t want to be someone else	Ma kontx nixtieq li tkun xi persuna oħra
Unless he knew something.	Sakemm ma kienx jaf xi ħaġa.
It's all quick and very easy.	Huwa kollu malajr u faċli ħafna.
He is very happy about it.	Huwa kuntent ħafna dwar dan.
I may not have much time	Jista’ ma tantx ikolli ħin
She had done it.	Hija kienet għamlet dan.
We had little money.	Kellna ftit flus.
Not for this one.	Mhux għal dan wieħed.
I know, there are many.	Naf, hemm ħafna.
I had to try something	Kelli nipprova xi ħaġa
I just knew she was going to be there	Kont naf biss li kienet se tkun hemm
He thought quickly.	Huwa ħaseb malajr.
It's a job, it's just a job.	Huwa xogħol, huwa biss xogħol.
But they never do.	Imma qatt ma jagħmlu.
I wasn’t surprised he had already left	Ma kontx sorpriż li kien diġà telaq
I always thought I was back	Dejjem ħsibt li tkun lura
It wasn't his.	Ma kienx tiegħu.
He is a good teacher.	Huwa għalliem tajjeb.
I think it would not be easy	Naħseb li ma jkunx faċli
I wasn’t so sure anymore	Ma kontx daqshekk ċert aktar
I wasn’t so surprised	Ma kontx daqshekk sorpriż
Why? 	Għaliex?
asked his friend.	staqsa lil ħabib tiegħu.
U ra.	U ra.
I was hoping you knew it wasn’t me	Kont nittama li int taf li ma kontx jien
But it would be bad for me.	Imma jkun ħażin għalija.
I can do this job	Kapaċi nagħmel dan ix-xogħol
Everyone is having the same problem.	Kulħadd qed ikollu l-istess problema.
I’m not going to do that here.	Jien mhux se nagħmel dan hawn.
That's here.	Dak hawn.
I wonder how much time has passed already	Nistaqsi kemm għadda żmien diġà
Often he is	Ħafna drabi hu
I can't take that	Ma nistax nieħu dak
I didn’t know where I was going to go from there.	Ma kontx naf fejn se mmur minn hemm.
I'm not even sure how.	Jien lanqas ċert kif.
That is a reason.	Dan huwa raġun.
I know what he knows	Naf dak li jaf
Really, we can.	Tassew, nistgħu.
But you will be back.	Imma int tkun lura.
A little worried, maybe	Ftit inkwetat, forsi
I knew all about it	Kont naf kollox dwar dan
I don't know why.	Ma nafx għaliex.
I couldn’t believe what was happening	Ma stajtx nemmen dak li kien qed jiġri
I think she did.	Naħseb li għamlet.
He will know what to do.	Huwa se jkun jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
He came out, he came out.	Huwa ħareġ, ħareġ.
It looks good to me.	Jidher tajjeb għalija.
I need to do some things	Għandi bżonn nagħmel xi affarijiet
They were there.	Kienu hemm fuq.
That nothing was going to happen.	Li xejn ma kien se jiġri.
I can't see that there is a problem	Ma nistax nara li hemm problema
Most people do.	Ħafna nies jagħmlu.
I should be there by now	Għandi nkun hemm sa issa
I think that’s where he went	Naħseb li hu fejn mar
I understand what it is.	Nifhem x'inhu.
There is work to be done.	Hemm xogħol li jrid isir.
I can be that way	Jien nista’ nkun hekk
As you see everything.	Kif qed tara kollox.
I was too young to understand what really happened	Kont żgħir wisq biex nifhem tassew x’ġara
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ma setax jieħu aktar.
I didn’t need to go back	Ma kellix bżonn immur lura
But that’s not all, there’s more.	Imma dan mhux kollox, hemm aktar.
It's nobody.	Mhu ħadd.
I really shouldn't say that	Tassew m'għandix ngħid hekk
He was having fun.	Kien qed jieħu gost.
A little while.	Ftit żmien.
More than you know.	Aktar milli taf.
Someone was talking.	Xi ħadd kien jitkellem.
Good to know.	Tajjeb li tkun taf.
He did what he could.	Kien għamel li seta’.
And a lot of people do.	U ħafna nies jagħmlu.
I knew what was going on	Kont naf x’kien hemm
Definitely great for us.	Żgur li hu kbir għalina.
I hadn’t really thought about that	Jien ma kontx verament ħsibt dwar dan
And it’s still better than nothing.	U għadu aħjar minn xejn.
I'm looking forward to it soon	Qed noqgħod li jkun aktar faċli dalwaqt
He had seen it happen.	Huwa kien ra li jiġri.
Not everyone, no.	Mhux kulħadd, le.
I heard about all the things that happened	Smajt dwar l-affarijiet kollha li ġara
Maybe we will.	Forsi aħna se.
I just need to see	Għandi bżonn biss nara
I needed to do this more often	Kelli bżonn nagħmel dan aktar spiss
But you know.	Imma taf.
I knew it was time to try	Kont naf li wasal iż-żmien li nipprova
I hope he has become a better man.	Nispera li sar raġel aħjar.
I know you will be fine	Naf li inti tkun tajjeb
I was glad you came back here.	Jien kont ferħan li ġejt lura hawn.
I think it must be me	Naħseb li għandu jkun jien
But it was too late.	Imma kien wasal tard wisq.
But it had to be him.	Imma kellu jkun hu.
I didn't know what was wrong	Ma kontx naf x’kien ħażin
I knew she was right	Kont naf li kellha raġun
And soon, everyone will know.	U dalwaqt, kulħadd ikun jaf.
He knew she was coming.	Kien jaf li kienet se tiġi.
I wasn’t doing any of this.	Jien ma kontx qed nagħmel xi ħaġa minn dan.
I think you can go now	Naħseb li tista' tmur issa
You did a very good job.	Int għamilt xogħol tajjeb ħafna.
I can’t talk about it right now	Ma nistax nitkellem dwarha bħalissa
And a little more for another.	U ftit aktar għal ieħor.
Nothing good at all.	Xejn xejn tajjeb.
I can't really think	Ma nistax verament naħseb
I never knew what it was.	Qatt ma kont naf x’kien.
It was done too quickly.	Sar malajr wisq.
I tell everyone how she did it	Ngħid lil kulħadd kif għamlet
I never saw a time when it wasn’t	Qatt ma rajt żmien meta ma kienx
I did everything on my own	Jien għamilt kollox waħdi
It wasn’t like that for us.	Ma kienx hekk għalina.
I had a hard time understanding what had just happened	Kelli diffiċli nifhem dak li kien għadu kif ġara
But you never really know.	Imma int qatt ma taf verament.
I made a kid out of it.	Jien għamilt tifel barra.
I don’t do that anymore	Jien ma nagħmel hekk aktar
Today, he was still unsure about anything.	Illum, ma kien għadu ċert dwar xejn.
Usually a year.	Normalment sena.
Well, she's nothing.	Ukoll, hi xejn.
I was looking forward to being alone again	Kont qed nistenna li nerġa’ nkun waħdi
The night before.	Il-lejla ta’ qabel.
Maybe tomorrow I don't know	Għada forsi ma nafx
I heard if there was anyone outside	Smajt jekk kien hemm xi ħadd fuq barra
I could see what was going on	Stajt nara x’kien qed jiġri
Good? 	Tajjeb?
I was just a little boy	Kont biss tifel żgħir
Not just me.	Mhux minni biss.
I couldn't see very well	Ma stajtx nara tajjeb ħafna
This is very easy to do.	Dan huwa faċli ħafna li tagħmel.
I really think he is	Verament naħseb li hu
Or maybe it still is.	Jew forsi għadu.
Maybe not everything.	Forsi mhux kollox.
I was quite happy.	Kont pjuttost kuntent.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ma setax jieħu aktar.
You need time.	Għandek bżonn il-ħin.
Please come quickly	Jekk jogħġbok ejja malajr
In fact, probably too late.	Fil-fatt, probabbilment tard wisq.
I never said anything like that	Qatt ma għedt xejn minn hekk
I strongly believe that	Nemmen ħafna li
Quite really.	Pjuttost verament.
He does a few other things.	Jagħmel ftit affarijiet oħra.
I wasn’t going to ask	Ma kontx se nistaqsi
We have to go home.	Irridu mmorru d-dar.
I couldn't, it was too late	Ma stajtx, kien tard wisq
He didn't even look.	Lanqas ħares.
I hope it was a good one	Nispera li kienet waħda tajba
I know you can do the job	Naf li inti tista 'tagħmel ix-xogħol
Not so much anymore.	Mhux hekk aktar.
And this is difficult.	U dan huwa diffiċli.
I want someone to know	Irrid li xi ħadd ikun jaf
Long time no see.	Żmien twil.
I will be with you forever and ever	Inkun miegħek dejjem u għal dejjem
They felt tired.	Ħassu għajjien.
He couldn’t just sit and watch.	Huwa ma setax biss joqgħod u jara.
She did before.	Hija għamlet qabel.
I was too scared for that	I kien jibża wisq għal dak
I was, until recently	Kont, sa ftit ilu
That was the truth.	Dik kienet il-verità.
It had just come out.	Kien għadu kemm ħareġ.
I knew he needed help	Kont naf li kellu bżonn l-għajnuna
But by then it was too late.	Imma sa dak iż-żmien kien tard wisq.
Well, it was really bad.	Ukoll, kien tassew ħażin.
That makes things easier.	Li jagħmel l-affarijiet aktar faċli.
What he did.	Dak li għamel.
I don't know how.	Ma nafx kif.
You know.	Int tkun taf.
I just have to tell you	Ikolli biss ngħidlek
He said it was good.	Huwa qal li kien tajjeb.
Nothing is exactly as it seems.	Xejn mhu eżatt kif jidher.
I couldn't tell who it was	Ma stajtx ngħid min kien
Well he could have been.	Ukoll huwa seta 'kien.
I thought you might be able to.	Ħsibt li tista 'tkun kapaċi.
Nothing can.	Xejn ma jista.
I want the truth out	Irrid il-verità barra
I was buying some time	Kont qed nixtri xi żmien
I was so hopeful that all would be well	Kont tant nittama li kollox ikun tajjeb
I need to talk first	L-ewwel għandi bżonn nitkellem
I didn't need anything	Ma kelli bżonn xejn
That’s not how it works.	Dak mhux kif jaħdem.
The time was coming for me.	Il-ħin kien jasal għandi.
I can't even imagine what to say	Lanqas nista’ naħseb xi ngħid
Many friends.	Ħafna ħbieb.
I was never interested.	Qatt ma kont interessat.
That could be a problem for him.	Dik tista’ tkun problema għalih.
Every time a little more.	Kull darba ftit aktar.
I need to get better	Għandi bżonn li tmur aħjar
I have already told everyone this	Dan diġà għedt lil kulħadd
And you still think it’s a great idea.	U għadek taħseb li hija idea kbira.
I want to hear more about this	Irrid nisma aktar dwar dan
Maybe it was working.	Forsi kien qed jaħdem.
He had thought things through.	Huwa kien ħaseb l-affarijiet.
One on one, I said.	Wieħed fuq wieħed, għidt.
I doubt it would	Niddubita li kieku
Soon.	Dalwaqt.
I knew it would, of course	Kont naf li se, ovvjament
He certainly doesn’t.	Huwa żgur li ma jagħmilx hekk.
I think you need some time alone	Naħseb li għandek bżonn ftit ħin waħdek
It would be.	Ikun.
I did what he did.	Jien għamilt dak li għamel.
She is a beautiful person.	Hija persuna sabiħa.
It won’t take long.	Mhux se jieħu ħafna.
If you don't want to.	Jekk ma tridx.
I thought that whoever did this might come back	Ħsibt li min kien għamel dan seta’ jiġi lura
It won't do.	Mhux se tagħmel.
I will definitely buy more.	Żgur li se nixtri aktar.
You have no idea.	M'għandekx idea.
But he couldn’t be sure.	Imma ma setax ikun ċert.
It's too early.	Għadu kmieni wisq.
But he knew it couldn’t happen.	Imma kien jaf li ma setax jiġri.
I want to understand the way I do this	Irrid nifhem mod kif nagħmel dan
I knew how worried he was for me	Kont naf kemm kien inkwetat għalija
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Forsi, forsi, forsi.
So will.	Hekk se.
I didn’t want to, but it just happened	Ma ridtx, imma ġara biss
I wasn’t sure of anything	Jien ma kont ċert minn xejn
You.	Inti.
Everyone is everyone.	Kulħadd huwa kulħadd.
Just to survive.	Biss biex jgħix.
I didn't expect that	Ma kontx nistenna dan
I try not to think about it	Nipprova ma naħsibx dwarha
I really didn't know	Verament ma kontx naf
I did a lot of bad things	Għamilt ħafna affarijiet ħażin
I could tell you that	Jien stajt ngħidlek hekk
I want this done already	Irrid li dan isir diġà
I'll tell you something.	Jien ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
I never thought so.	Qatt ma ħsibt hekk.
Really, it's good.	Tassew, huwa tajjeb.
I don’t want to talk now.	Ma rridx nitkellem issa.
Not once, ever.	Mhux darba, qatt.
He didn't seem scared.	Ma deherx jibża’.
The truth is, there are many.	Il-verità hi, hemm ħafna.
I didn’t know where you went	Ma kontx naf fejn int mort
I don’t know what to say.	Ma nafx x'se ngħid.
I'm a boy.	Jien tifel.
I really, really wanted to	Jien verament, verament ridt
I know people.	Naf nies.
I just wanted to tell you	Ridt ngħidlek biss
But she had a problem.	Imma kellha problema.
I will buy one again	Se nerġa nixtri wieħed
Better a poor horse than no horse at all	Aħjar minn ftit wisq
We just don't.	Aħna biss le.
We were just people	Konna nies biss
I didn’t do anything wrong last night	Ma għamilt xejn ħażin ilbieraħ filgħaxija
More than a bit.	Aktar minn daqsxejn.
I was not for nothing	Jien ma kont għal xejn
Everything would be fine.	Kollox ikun tajjeb.
It has been here for a long time.	Ilu hawn għal żmien twil.
He is a tall man.	Huwa raġel twil.
But you’re the first one.	Imma int l-ewwel wieħed.
You know he’s not.	Taf li hu mhux.
I saw the truth	Rajt il-verità
Lots of time for that.	Ħafna ħin għal dak.
That’s better than nothing.	Dak aħjar minn xejn.
I hope he does that before	Jien nittama li jagħmel dak li qabel
I can't tell you for sure	Ma nistax ngħidlek żgur
In fact, I can understand that	Fil-fatt nista' nifhem dan
I'm nobody.	Jien ħadd.
I couldn’t believe it was actually mine	Ma stajtx nemmen li fil-fatt kien tiegħi
That would be good.	Dak ikun tajjeb.
You know how these things are.	Taf kif huma dawn l-affarijiet.
I can do almost anything here	Jien nista' nagħmel kważi kull ħaġa hawn
He’s not mine, either.	Hu mhux tiegħi, lanqas.
Maybe so it should be.	Forsi hekk għandu jkun.
It's really a job.	Huwa tassew xogħol.
Something everyone around can see.	Xi ħaġa li kulħadd madwar jista 'jara.
Or did she.	Jew għamlet hi.
Three years ago.	Tliet snin ilu.
I still think about it	Għadni naħseb dwar dan
I can go back alone	Nista' nagħmel lura waħdi
I think he knew what he was talking about	Naħseb li kien jaf x’kien qed jitkellem
There he is.	Hemm hu.
He could not be here.	Ma setax ikun hawn.
And maybe not.	U forsi le.
Tired of doing that	Għajjien li nagħmel dan
I didn’t want to think about it right now	Ma ridtx jaħseb dwarha bħalissa
I doubt he will come back	Niddubita li se jiġi lura
I know a lot of people	Naf ħafna nies
Well, it's late.	Ukoll, huwa tard.
I still can, you know	Għadni nista, taf
But maybe not.	Imma forsi le.
It's a lot of things together.	Huwa ħafna affarijiet flimkien.
I just have to do something	Għandi biss nagħmel xi ħaġa
You don't have to either.	Lanqas għandek.
I don’t want to be alone again	Ma rridx inkun waħdi mill-ġdid
I didn’t have time for that	Ma kellix ħin għal dan
I never knew anyone who left	Qatt ma kont naf lil xi ħadd li telaq
I wonder how it looks	Nistaqsi kif tidher
I was going to be late.	Kont se nkun tard.
I hope to see one someday	Nispera li nara waħda xi darba
Maybe everything, he thought.	Forsi kollox, ħaseb.
It's going too far.	Huwa sejjer wisq.
I can take you on that	I jista 'jieħu inti fuq dak
She knew.	Kienet taf.
Nothing more than that.	Xejn aktar minn hekk.
And not so long ago.	U mhux daqshekk twil ilu.
That was all.	Kienet kollox.
I thought it might be for a while.	Ħsibt li tista’ tkun għal xi żmien.
He was right.	Kellu raġun.
That can be difficult for many people.	Li jista 'jkun diffiċli għal ħafna nies.
I thought he wanted this	Ħsibt li ried dan
No, we are not.	Le, aħna le.
I didn’t have to be there	Jien ma kellix inkun hemm
But not this week.	Imma mhux din il-ġimgħa.
Only one man.	Ta’ raġel wieħed biss.
What's going on ?.	X'qed jiġri?.
I needed to know for sure	Kelli bżonn inkun naf żgur
I was thinking, maybe today we should go home	Kont qed naħseb, forsi llum għandna mmorru d-dar
He could not see.	Ma setax jara.
He lives around there.	Jgħix madwar hemm.
I didn’t want to.	Jien ma ridtx.
I hope it helps !. 	Nispera li jgħin!. 
working with me.	li jaħdem miegħi.
I'm here with you	Jien qiegħed hawn miegħek
I’m not entirely sure how much more.	M'inix ċert għal kollox kemm aktar.
It should be easy enough.	Għandu jkun faċli biżżejjed.
No, it would not be good.	Le, ma jkunx tajjeb.
It may be already.	Jista 'jkun diġà.
Probably tonight or tomorrow.	Probabbilment illejla jew għada.
There is a lot of money.	Hemm ħafna flus.
I saw that one.	Rajt dak wieħed.
Now it’s just before it happened.	Issa għadu qabel ma ġara.
I really think about it	Verament naħseb dwar dan
It was hard to tell why.	Kien diffiċli li tgħid għaliex.
He said he would return later.	Qal li kien jerġa’ lura aktar tard.
And it seems to work.	U jidher li jaħdem.
It is so too.	Hija hekk ukoll.
She can do whatever she wants.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dak kollu li trid.
I had to eat nothing	Kelli niekol xejn
I know there are a lot of people	Naf li jkun hemm ħafna nies
I wanted to talk to him	Ridt nitkellem miegħu
Or nothing.	Jew xejn.
Many times, you.	Ħafna drabi, int.
It survives.	Dan jgħix.
No one had ever done so before.	Ħadd qatt ma kien għamel hekk qabel.
A great one.	Waħda kbira.
I can't do this again	Ma nistax nagħmel dan mill-ġdid
I think maybe she’s right	Naħseb li forsi hi raġun
I hope it will be helpful to you.	Nittama li se jkun ta 'għajnuna għalik.
I thought now everyone knew	Ħsibt li issa kulħadd kien jaf
I wonder how much he has, really	Nistaqsi kemm għandu, tassew
And he is eating much better.	U qed jiekol ħafna aħjar.
I'm capable.	Jien kapaċi.
I wasn’t sure anything would be	Ma kontx ċert li xejn kien ikun
I hope it never comes	Nispera li qatt ma tiġi
I didn’t want to be late	Ma ridtx inkun tard
Me and you.	Jien u inti.
I didn’t want to have fun	Ma ridtx nieħu gost
It was hard to tell.	Kien diffiċli li tgħid.
I really can't understand you	Verament ma nistax nifhem int
This has to happen.	Dan irid jiġri.
It will be good.	Hija se tkun tajba.
I never even thought about it	Lanqas qatt ma ħsibt dwarha
And today, we're back to a good one.	U llum, aħna qed lura għal waħda tajba.
I didn’t want that to happen	Ma ridtx li jiġri
I didn't even know	Lanqas kont naf
I had thought about this a long time ago	I kellha ħsibt dwar dan żmien twil ilu
I'm your friend.	Jien ħabib tiegħek.
Also, nothing is forever.	Barra minn hekk, xejn mhu għal dejjem.
I try not to think about what came next	Nipprova ma naħsibx dwar dak li ġie wara
I have a better way.	Għandi mod aħjar.
I made sure of that.	Jien għamilt ċert minn dan.
That was about a year ago.	Dan kien madwar sena ilu.
I would be ready for it	Inkun lest għalih
I had a pretty good idea who it was	Kelli idea pjuttost tajba min kien
That's what happened.	Hekk ġara.
We can't take it anymore.	Ma nistgħux aktar.
I really like this.	Jien inħobb ħafna dan.
He seemed to have no problem.	Deher li ma kellu l-ebda problema.
I was still there last night	Kont għadni lbieraħ filgħaxija
He just wanted to be ready in and out of there.	Ried biss li jkun lest u barra minn hemm.
I'm scared.	Jien nibża.
You go now, you say, and that’s good.	Inti tmur issa, inti tgħid, u dan huwa tajjeb.
I never want to do that	Qatt ma nixtieq nagħmel hekk
Maybe he didn’t.	Forsi ma kellux.
I never did that	Qatt ma għamilt dan
I do this every morning	Nagħmel dan kull filgħodu
I didn’t have that	Jien ma kellix dik
I have to.	Ikolli.
I think there is more	Naħseb li hemm aktar
You have no idea how bad it can be.	M'għandekx idea kemm jista' jkun ħażin.
And nothing is.	U xejn mhu.
I can talk to him and everything	Kapaċi nitkellem miegħu u kollox
I couldn't go any further	Ma stajtx immur aktar
He will probably be here soon.	Huwa probabbilment ser ikun hawn dalwaqt.
Why, he couldn't say.	Għaliex, ma setax jgħid.
I shouldn't even be talking to you	Lanqas għandi nkun qed nitkellem miegħek
But you will never know us.	Imma int qatt ma tkun taf magħna.
That was wrong.	Dak kien ħażin.
I needed to go shopping	Kelli bżonn immur nixtri
Now it is.	Issa huwa.
I really want to do what is right	Verament irrid nagħmel dak li hu tajjeb
Hu.	Hu.
Obviously, none of this is right.	Ovvjament, xejn minn dan mhu tajjeb.
Nor is he afraid.	Lanqas jibża’.
It will not happen.	Mhux se jiġri.
No one else lived here.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien jgħix hawn.
I still think this is better	Għadni naħseb li dan huwa aħjar
I hope that will be enough	Jien nittama li jkun biżżejjed
I was surprised by this	Kont sorpriż b’dan
This has happened a few times.	Dan ġara ftit drabi.
It’s not good, you are so alone.	Mhuwiex tajjeb, inti hekk waħdek.
I want to do something	Nixtieq nagħmel xi ħaġa
I know you know.	Naf li taf.
I know it’s too late now.	Naf li issa huwa tard wisq.
I’m not getting the whole school to know about this	Jien mhux qed ikolli l-iskola kollha taf dwar dan
He started trying this.	Huwa beda jipprova dan.
Not too much.	Mhux wisq.
I have a problem with that	Għandi problema b'dan
I think he was doing	Naħseb li kien qed jagħmel
Maybe not for a few years.	Forsi mhux għal ftit snin.
I was very happy at home	Kont kuntent ħafna d-dar
He seems to have done everything he wanted to do, too.	Jidher li għamel dak kollu li ried jagħmel, ukoll.
I wanted you to know so.	Jien ridt li tkun taf hekk.
Expect to do this more than once.	Jistenna li tagħmel dan aktar minn darba.
We now have a lot of time.	Issa għandna ħafna ħin.
There is more to it than that.	Hemm aktar minn hekk.
Sitting too much.	Bilqiegħda wisq.
You will know everything.	Se tkun taf kollox.
I had to listen to everything	Kelli nisma’ kollox
I need something good before that	Għandi bżonn xi ħaġa tajba qabel dik
Something you might want.	Xi ħaġa li tista 'tixtieq.
But he did.	Imma hekk għamel.
I can’t believe you did this for me	Ma nistax nemmen li għamilt dan għalija
He knew that without being able to say how.	Kien jaf li mingħajr ma seta’ jgħid kif.
He really, actually said that.	Huwa verament, fil-fatt qal li.
I just want to know about it and things	Nixtieq biss inkun naf dwarha u l-affarijiet
Or that it is supposed to be.	Jew li suppost tkun.
I didn’t know it was so bad	Ma kontx naf li kien daqshekk ħażin
Very, very bad.	Ħażin ħafna, ħafna.
I went to my car	Jien mort lejn il-karozza tiegħi
I never wanted to be good	Qatt ma ridt inkun tajjeb
That’s looking pretty hard now.	Dak qed jidher pjuttost diffiċli issa.
I want to do all this myself	Irrid nagħmel dan kollu jien
Nothing seems to help.	Xejn jidher li jgħin.
It happens.	Jiġri.
Or really late.	Jew verament tard.
It should not take more than a few hours.	M'għandux jieħu aktar minn ftit sigħat.
Great help from everyone.	Għajnuna kbira minn kulħadd.
This should not be too difficult.	Dan m'għandux ikun diffiċli wisq.
I was hoping it would be him	Kont nittama li jkun hu
This is just how it works.	Dan huwa biss kif jaħdem.
I know how difficult this must be for you	Naf kemm dan għandu jkun diffiċli għalik
She is ready with me.	Hija lest miegħi.
I don’t know why this is so.	Ma nafx għaliex dan hu hekk.
I wanted to know what he was thinking	Ridt inkun naf x’kien qed jaħseb tassew
And it's good.	U huwa tajjeb.
But she was talking.	Imma kienet qed titkellem.
Not sure what happened there.	Mhux ċert x'ġara hemmhekk.
I know, I know.	Nafu, nafu.
But it happened.	Imma ġara.
I couldn't tell anyone	Ma stajt ngħid lil ħadd
I wanted to know everything, understand everything	Ridt inkun naf kollox, nifhem kollox
And someone else around.	U xi ħadd ieħor madwar.
I always need some help	Dejjem għandi bżonn xi għajnuna
I didn’t want to know who he was	Ma ridtx inkun naf min kien
That works well.	Li jaħdem tajjeb.
I just need to think things through	Għandi bżonn biss naħseb l-affarijiet waħdi
Never anything.	Qatt xejn.
I knew it couldn’t be as easy as it seemed	Kont naf li ma setax ikun faċli kif deher
I really need to do some work	Verament għandi bżonn nagħmel xi xogħol
For another, she was tired.	Għal ieħor, kienet għajjien.
I need you to be with me on this	Għandi bżonn li tkun miegħi fuq dan
There was nothing for him there.	Ma kien hemm xejn għalih hemmhekk.
Maybe it was too early.	Forsi kien kmieni wisq.
I can’t do everything.	Ma nistax nagħmel kollox.
It’s a beautiful morning above.	Huwa filgħodu sabiħa hawn fuq.
I hope it helps someone	Nispera li jgħin lil xi ħadd
I just wanted to be sure.	Ridt biss inkun ċert.
We want you to be happy.	Irridu li inti tkun kuntent.
I didn't want to do it again	Ma ridtx nerġa’ nagħmel
Both are.	It-tnejn huma.
I can't see this.	Ma nistax inkun qed nara dan.
I think it’s always been a bit of a problem	Naħseb li dejjem kien daqsxejn problema
But it doesn't have to work that way.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn jaħdem hekk.
I said it was wrong.	Għidt li kien ħażin.
Your book will be very helpful.	Il-ktieb tiegħek ikun ta’ għajnuna kbira.
I can’t believe it happened	Ma nistax nemmen li ġara
Great is good.	Kbir huwa tajjeb.
So we had.	Hekk kellna aħna.
I wasn’t me	Jien ma kontx jien
But they have money.	Imma għandhom flus.
But you are not interested.	Imma m'intix interessat.
It wasn’t my thing.	Ma kienx ħaġa tiegħi.
I loved everything about it	Kont inħobb kollox dwarha
You just go.	Inti biss tmur.
None of this is certain.	Xejn minn dan mhu ċert.
Try to be on both.	Ipprova tkun fuq it-tnejn.
It's been a while.	Ilu għal xi żmien.
There is something for everyone.	Hemm xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
I didn’t want to be like that anymore.	Ma ridtx inkun aktar hekk.
The, the, the.	Le, le, le.
I have enough.	Għandi biżżejjed.
I had one chance and only one chance	Kelli ċans wieħed u ċans wieħed biss
It's working today.	Illum qed jaħdem.
Nobody really talks to me like that	Ħadd ma verament jitkellem miegħi hekk
I have to believe.	Irrid nemmen.
And the things he does well.	U l-affarijiet li jagħmel tajjeb.
I want to see what they do	Irrid nara x'qed jagħmlu
After that I saw a little	Wara dan rajt ftit
No, it's not.	Le, mhuwiex.
It never looks the same again.	Qatt ma jerġa' jidher l-istess.
I needed to do this for myself	Kelli bżonn nagħmel dan għalija
You have the help.	Int għandek l-għajnuna.
And another, on.	U ieħor, fuq .
I can see how this would be a problem	Nista' nara kif din tkun problema
What goes, comes.	Dak li jmur, jiġi.
I didn’t need to know this	Ma kellix bżonn inkun naf dan
I know what she wants	Naf xi trid hi
I said so.	Jien għidt hekk.
I want to try to understand	Irrid nipprova nifhem
It is not working.	Mhux qed jaħdem.
Nobody ever knows what he's doing.	Ħadd qatt ma jaf x’qed jagħmel.
For a time.	Għal żmien.
I knew there was more	Kont naf li kien hemm aktar
It's just great to see.	Huwa biss kbir biex tara.
I couldn’t tell if she was still here or not	Ma stajtx ngħid jekk kinitx għadha hawn jew le
You seem sure.	Inti tidher ċert.
This came out.	Dan ħareġ.
I knew it was something	Kont naf li kienet xi ħaġa
I never knew why it was so.	Qatt ma kont naf għaliex hu hekk.
I would be someone else for him.	Inkun xi ħadd ieħor għalih.
It was very good.	Kien tajjeb ħafna.
I’m not sure what’s going wrong.	M'inix ċert x'inhu sejjer ħażin.
I understand.	Jien nifhem.
He didn't, of course.	Huwa ma, ovvjament.
I just moved here.	Għadni kif mort hawn.
Nothing like that happened there.	Hemmhekk ma ġara xejn bħal dan.
He saw something else there.	Huwa ra xi ħaġa oħra hemmhekk.
I should really take some time	Għandi verament nieħu ftit ħin
They didn’t even look at each other.	Lanqas ħares lejn xulxin.
Why? 	Għaliex?
I will never go back	Jien qatt mhu se mmur lura
It was really so.	Kien tassew hekk.
We can do what we are doing now.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dak li qed nagħmlu issa.
I have to tell you now	Ikolli ngħidlek issa
I’ve been here a while	Jien ilni ftit hawn
They all do the same thing.	Kollha jagħmlu l-istess ħaġa.
I knew where she was going	Kont naf fejn kienet se tkun
It would have been so easy.	Kieku kien daqshekk faċli.
I think he knows what	Naħseb li jaf x'hemm
You know that's not the truth.	Taf li mhux il-verità.
I still can't.	Għadni ma nistax.
No, obviously not.	Le, ovvjament le.
We can and should do better.	Nistgħu u għandna nagħmlu aħjar.
I had a little back	Kelli lura ftit lura
I’m glad he’s here with me	Jien ferħan li qiegħed hawn miegħi
That felt great.	Li ħassu kbir.
John was happy.	John kien kuntent.
I can do this later.	Nista' nagħmel dan aktar tard.
Now you're here.	Issa int hawn.
I know what I just said	Naf dak li għadek kif għedt
It can make it look like something else.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel tidher bħal xi ħaġa oħra.
I don’t want to think after that.	Ma rridx naħseb wara dan.
I want so much more than that	Irrid ħafna aktar minn dan
He knew it would soon be too.	Kien jaf li dalwaqt se jkun ukoll.
You never know what's going to happen.	Qatt ma tkun taf x’se jiġri.
I could tell this was hard for him	Jien stajt ngħid li dan kien diffiċli għalih
When you think, stay here and don’t say or do anything.	Meta taħseb, toqgħod hawn u ma tgħid jew tagħmel xejn.
This happens every year.	Dan jiġri kull sena.
I will be talking to him about this later tonight.	Se nkun qed nitkellem miegħu dwar dan aktar tard illejla.
I was there	Jien kont qiegħed hemm
Okay, now tell me something.	Tajjeb, issa tgħidli xi ħaġa.
I think that’s all he lives for	Naħseb li huwa dak kollu li jgħix
I didn’t want to think about it anymore	Ma ridtx naħseb aktar dwar dan
You see, that was the first time it happened.	Tara, dik kienet l-ewwel darba li ġara.
You are not eating.	Mhux qed tiekol.
I would have been surprised	Kieku kont sorpriż
That you may know.	Li tista’ tkun taf.
Sorry he went.	Jiddispjaċini li huwa mar.
I hope you are doing well.	Nittama li inti sejjer tajjeb.
I still wanted too much	Għadni ridt wisq
Or you can do both.	Jew tista 'tagħmel it-tnejn.
In the room.	Fil-kamra.
I can't tell you all this	Ma nistax ngħidlek dan kollu
I could only hope they were out.	Stajt biss nittama li kienu barra.
I want better for you	Irrid aħjar għalik
I was pretty wrong about that.	Jien kont ħażin ħażin dwar dan.
I didn’t think I would be here.	Ma kontx naħseb li tkun hawn.
You said no.	Inti għedt le.
He didn't want you to know that you could do that.	Ma riedx li tkun taf li tista’ tagħmel dan.
I do a lot of these.	Jien nagħmel ħafna minn dawn.
Where everyone knows everyone.	Fejn kulħadd jaf lil kulħadd.
Something he had	Ħaġa li kellu
I wait, and I wait, and I wait	Nistenna, u nistenna, u nistenna
And that's almost all of them.	U dan huwa kważi kollha kemm huma.
I saw this play.	Rajt dan jilgħab.
I would be back.	Inkun lura.
Maybe someday he will come back here.	Forsi xi darba jmur lura hawn.
I’ve done a lot for you	Jien stajt għamilt ħafna għalik
I have to say it is quite beautiful	Irrid ngħid li hija pjuttost sabiħa
There was only one thing wrong.	Kien hemm ħaġa waħda biss ħażina.
Bla bla bla bla.	Bla bla bla.
He just wants to.	Biss irid.
No more.	Mhux aktar.
Well, almost never.	Ukoll, kważi qatt.
I don’t believe anything he says	Jien ma nemmen xejn li jgħid
I will take help.	Jien ser nieħu għajnuna.
He must come back tomorrow morning.	Għandu jiġi lura għada filgħodu.
That has to be there.	Dak irid ikun hemm.
I'm still not sure what just happened.	Għadni ma kontx ċert x’kien għadu kif ġara.
This is what we have.	Dan huwa dak li għandna.
I didn’t know who she was	Ma kontx naf min kienet
There, look at that.	Hemmhekk, ħares lejn dak.
I wanted to be yours	Ridt inkun tiegħek
It is a very bad idea.	Hija idea ħażina ħafna.
It will be ready.	Se jkun lest.
And it keeps coming.	U jibqa’ ġej.
He just came home today.	Huwa għadu kif ġie d-dar illum.
Come back to me.	Ejja lura għandi.
I certainly would have been	Żgur li kont inkun hekk
He could never do that.	Qatt ma seta’ jagħmel dan.
I had to say something.	Kelli ngħid xi ħaġa.
I wanted to see.	Ridt nara.
I wasn't even thinking	Jien lanqas kont qed naħseb
And he wanted to help.	U ried jgħin.
I thought please	Ħsibt li jekk jogħġbok
You, boy.	Inti, tifel.
And so it should.	U hekk għandu.
I want to.	Irrid.
But that was all later.	Imma dak kollu kien aktar tard.
I think I’ve done something	Naħseb li stajt għamilt xi ħaġa
If you’re that, you know it.	Jekk int dak, taf dan.
He had been waiting years for this.	Huwa kien jistenna snin għal dan.
Maybe here the same.	Forsi hawn l-istess.
He said it could happen, and it did.	Qal li jista’ jiġri, u kien ġara.
I can't even say what it looks like.	Lanqas nista’ ngħid kif tidher.
But that’s not what’s happening.	Imma dak mhux dak li qed jiġri.
I’m glad he’s here.	Jiena tajjeb li hu hawn.
All this here.	Dan kollu hawn.
I didn’t think it would be like that	Ma kontx naħseb li se jkun hekk
I know you want someone to do everything better	Naf li tixtieq li xi ħadd jagħmel kollox aħjar
He will not come.	Hu mhux se jiġi.
Not here either.	Lanqas hawn.
A little back.	Ftit lura.
He hadn't said anything.	Ma kellu qal xejn.
And so it goes.	U hekk sejjer.
Much more than once.	Ħafna aktar minn darba.
You can see how much.	Tista 'tara kemm.
You know that.	Taf li.
But they never did.	Imma qatt ma kienu jagħmlu.
But not so much.	Imma mhux daqshekk.
But not much.	Imma mhux ħafna.
I didn't want to be like that	Ma ridtx inkun hekk
I know what she will say.	Naf x'se tgħid hi.
Which she did.	Li hi għamlet.
We did so.	Għamilna hekk.
Like many.	Bħal ħafna.
It has been a long time.	Kien hemm żmien twil.
And there is more.	U hemm aktar.
Everything was just like that.	Kollox kien biss hekk.
Almost everything, actually.	Kważi kollox, fil-fatt.
This wasn’t the first time, either.	Din ma kinitx l-ewwel darba, lanqas.
A little late isn’t you	Xi ftit tard mhux int
I haven't said anything yet	Għadni ma għedt xejn
Who would have thought?	Min kien jaħseb?.
I thought it was wrong.	Ħsibt li kien ħażin.
It certainly was.	Żgur li kien hekk.
I thought it was going to go a year or so.	Ħsibt li kien se jmur sena jew hekk.
No one even knows where he is.	Ħadd ma jaf lanqas fejn hu.
I’m together at my job.	Jien flimkien fuq ix-xogħol tiegħi.
It is, like.	Huwa, bħal.
Everything works fine.	Kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
I thought he could play	Ħsibt li jista’ jilgħab
I’m not sure about that.	M'inix ċert dwar dan.
Maybe I never did.	Forsi qatt ma għamilt.
He was not in the room.	Ma kienx fil-kamra.
No, it's just you.	Le, int biss.
She says she doesn’t want to appear together.	Tgħid li ma tridx tidher flimkien.
They felt very tired.	Ħassu għajjien ħafna.
I'm on one right now.	Jien fuq waħda bħalissa.
I didn't want to see it	Ma ridtx nara
I hope he does.	Nispera li jagħmel.
It's over.	Hija fuq.
This could happen again.	Dan jista’ jerġa’ jiġri.
I needed help, but there was nothing	Kelli bżonn l-għajnuna, imma ma kien hemm xejn
This was his first time.	Din kienet l-ewwel darba tiegħu.
But it was.	Imma kien.
It probably was.	Probabbilment kien hekk.
After all, if not now, when ?.	Wara kollox, jekk mhux issa, meta?.
It didn’t seem difficult.	Ma deherx diffiċli.
Not about anything much.	Mhux dwar xejn ħafna.
That's not the problem.	Dik mhix il-problema.
It says nothing.	Ma jgħid xejn.
I know he should.	Naf li għandu.
I need more help around here	Għandi bżonn aktar għajnuna madwar hawn
Not ready yet.	Għadu mhux lest.
You will do well.	Inti ser tagħmel tajjeb.
I did exactly what he said	Għamilt eżatt dak li qal
.	.
Nor would that be enough.	U lanqas dan ma jkunx biżżejjed.
It was a very bad thing.	Kienet xi ħaġa ħażina ħafna.
He didn’t want to know, but he was.	Ma riedx ikun jaf, imma kien.
I am not and I cannot be	Jien mhux u ma nistax inkun
I think quickly.	Naħseb malajr.
And so he did.	U hekk għamel.
I was willing to do that	Kont lest li nagħmel dan
Something was wrong there.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina hemmhekk.
Definitely so it seems.	Żgur hekk jidher.
And that’s good enough.	U dan huwa tajjeb biżżejjed.
I know how much you want this	Naf kemm trid dan
They were.	Huma kienu.
I needed more money, for one thing	Jien kelli bżonn aktar flus, għal ħaġa waħda
I was seeing something.	Jien kont nara xi ħaġa.
I know a teacher who doesn’t.	Naf għalliem li le.
This was not good enough.	Dan ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed.
I will think more about this	Se naħseb aktar dwar dan
But so bad, so bad.	Imma daqshekk ħażin, tant ħażin.
But he is thinking.	Imma qed jaħseb.
I know he was afraid it would be me.	Naf li kien jibża li se nkun jien.
He goes there again.	Hemmhekk jerġa’ jmur.
I have a lot to say about that book	Għandi ħafna xi ngħid dwar dak il-ktieb
It must be back.	Għandu jkun lura.
I’m on to something without quite knowing what it is.	Jien fuq xi ħaġa mingħajr ma naf pjuttost x'inhi.
She knows nothing.	Hija ma taf xejn.
But difficult for us.	Imma diffiċli għalina.
He had said that.	Huwa kien qal li.
He was glad she had.	Huwa kien ferħan li kellha.
He is a good friend.	Huwa ħabib tajjeb.
But it must.	Imma għandu.
I already knew what you were going to think	Diġà kont naf x'se taħseb
He looks surprised.	Jidher sorpriż.
I love my time here	Jien inħobb il-ħin tiegħi hawn
It could be more about, so.	Jista 'jkun aktar dwar, hekk.
Better to say so again	Aħjar ngħid hekk mill-ġdid
I want to know for sure.	Irrid inkun naf żgur.
I know where he lives	Naf fejn jgħix
Many other things.	Ħafna affarijiet oħra.
I was hoping to say so	Kont nittama li tgħid hekk
I want to know how to do it.	Irrid inkun naf kif nagħmel dan.
Look at what they are doing.	Ħares lejn dak li qed jagħmlu.
She had done nothing.	Hija kienet għamlet xejn.
None of this, of course, comes easy.	Xejn minn dan, ovvjament, ma jiġi faċli.
You are so good.	Inti daqshekk tajjeb.
But no.	Imma mhux.
Today, tomorrow, next week.	Illum, għada, il-ġimgħa d-dieħla.
I don’t think they do.	Ma naħsibx li jagħmlu.
I will talk to you about everything	Jien se nitkellem miegħek fuq kollox
He looked good tonight.	Huwa deher tajjeb illejla.
But enough about that.	Imma biżżejjed dwar dan.
That's what you want to do.	Dak hu li trid tagħmel.
I couldn't be with anyone	Ma stajt inkun ma’ ħadd
Tom couldn't see anything.	Tom ma seta’ jara xejn.
I have a lot of time	Għandi ħafna ħin
I want to never go back	Irrid qatt ma mmur lura
And you eat, you eat, you eat.	U tiekol, tiekol, tiekol.
I know enough things to say	Naf biżżejjed affarijiet xi ngħid
I wonder what you are thinking	Nistaqsi x'qed taħseb
I hadn’t thought about it that way before.	Ma kontx ħsibt dwarha hekk qabel.
That was so hard.	Dak kien tant diffiċli.
I can’t have that, you see	Ma nistax ikolli dak, tara
I wanted to do that.	Jien ridt nagħmel hekk.
It’s nothing, really.	Mhu xejn, tassew.
Nothing ever seems to work properly.	Xejn qatt ma jidher li jaħdem kif suppost.
This will come to him, the same.	Dan se jasal għalih, l-istess.
I'm not so sure about that	M'inix daqshekk ċert minn dan
I had a great time	Kelli ħafna ħin
He was just a good man.	Kien biss raġel tajjeb.
They are doing what you need.	Huma qed jagħmlu dak li għandek bżonn.
Today, not so much.	Illum, mhux daqshekk.
I never really thought about it that way	Qatt ma kont verament ħsibt dwarha hekk
I was one.	Jien kont wieħed.
I wondered what he was seeing	Stajt naħseb x’kien qed jara
I could never do that	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel hekk
And this is what he wanted to do.	U dan hu li ried jagħmel.
Not forever, of course.	Mhux għal dejjem, ovvjament.
You'll think of something.	Int ser taħseb xi ħaġa.
I never had to say no	Qatt ma kelli ngħid le
That's a long time.	Dak huwa żmien twil.
I couldn’t eat anything.	Ma kont stajt niekol xejn.
I am so glad to see you here	Jiena tant kuntent li nara hawn
It seems to be working well for me here.	Jidher li qed jaħdem tajjeb għalija hawn.
He could buy what he needed.	Seta’ jixtri dak li kellu bżonn.
I want to stay home with you	Irrid noqgħod id-dar miegħek
The truth is.	Il-verità hi.
I have to tell you this	Għandi ngħidlek dan
I was doing it for us	Kont qed nagħmel għalina
It will not be easy and may take some time.	Mhux se jkun faċli u jista 'jieħu ftit żmien.
Now was the time, he was saying.	Issa kien iż-żmien, kien qed jgħid.
If he is so good.	Jekk hu daqshekk tajjeb.
I'm glad you're okay.	Jien kuntent li inti tajjeb.
I see nothing wrong	Ma nara xejn ħażin
I did, a long time ago	Għamilt, żmien twil ilu
This is the only chance they have	Dan huwa l-uniku ċans li għandhom
I couldn’t have been better	Ma stajtx inkun aħjar
I knew I was doing something	Kont naf li kont qed tagħmel xi ħaġa
I know there is something wrong now	Naf li hemm xi ħaġa ħażina issa
I said it was going to happen	Għidt li kien se jiġri
And then, too.	U wara, ukoll.
It was better that way.	Kien aħjar hekk.
I'm not sure where here	M'inix ċert fejn hawn
But it's worth it, that's for sure !.	Imma ta 'min jagħmel, dan huwa żgur!.
I had to wait to see who it was	Kelli nistenna biex nara min kien
I was the only child there	Jien kont l-uniku tifel hemmhekk
This is wrong too	Dan huwa ħażin ukoll
Everything was here.	Kollox kien hawn.
But why do I try to tell you.	Imma għaliex nipprova ngħidlek.
I never knew about it.	Qatt ma kont naf dwar dan.
I never knew I was coming	Qatt ma kont naf li ġejt
You and me.	Int u jien.
I wanted to know what was going on	Ridt inkun naf x’qed jiġri
He has been staying with me.	Ġie joqgħod miegħi.
But it was all mine.	Imma kien kollu tiegħi.
Just too good.	Biss wisq tajjeb.
But he was busy.	Imma kien okkupat.
Quite a few, you might say.	Pjuttost ftit, tista 'tgħid.
Not just now.	Mhux issa biss.
You definitely don’t want to.	Int żgur li ma tridx.
There is no way he didn’t know about it.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li ma kienx jaf dwar dan.
Ta.	Ta.
That's what can happen.	Dak hu li jista' jiġri.
I love our home.	Inħobb id-dar tagħna.
We’re almost there, it’s almost ready.	Aħna kważi hemm, huwa kważi lest.
But no one comes.	Imma ħadd ma jiġi.
I didn't know what was going to happen	Ma kontx naf x’se jiġri
He really was at home.	Huwa verament kien id-dar.
I went back home	Mort lura d-dar
It's just like that.	Hija biss hekk.
I needed to do something	Kelli bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa
I knew he couldn't do much	Kont naf li ma tantx seta’ jagħmel
You never know.	Qatt ma tkun taf.
Not sure what to say.	Mhux ċert x'se ngħid.
All this without expecting anything in return.	Dan kollu mingħajr ma jistenna xejn lura.
Without being able to eat.	Mingħajr ma tkunx tista' tiekol.
I knew why, but I couldn't say anything	Kont naf għaliex, imma ma stajt ngħid xejn
You have been for more.	Int ġejt għal aktar.
We both have to be there.	It-tnejn għandna nkunu hemm.
I've heard enough.	Smajt biżżejjed.
You wouldn't.	Inti ma tkunx.
I do more for you than he did	Jien nagħmel aktar għalik milli għamel hu
I love my home here	Inħobb id-dar tiegħi hawn
There was someone here.	Kien hemm xi ħadd hawn.
Or we can and do if we want to.	Jew nistgħu u nagħmlu jekk irridu.
And sometimes that can be a problem	U xi drabi din tista’ tkun problema
I'm not.	Jien le.
I just thought I was	Ħsibt biss li kont
And everything really was great.	U kollox verament kien kbir.
I don’t do anything else unless you want to	Jien ma nagħmel xejn aktar sakemm ma tridx
I think it will be good	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb
I want you to know one thing	Irrid li tkun taf ħaġa waħda
Help friend.	Għajnuna ħabib.
I didn’t know why	Ma kontx naf għaliex
She was so beautiful.	Kienet tant sabiħa.
Today in fact.	Illum fil-fatt.
I don't know what it is or what it was.	Ma nafx x’inhu jew x’kien ikun.
Here it was.	Hawn kien.
I have never done anything to you before	Għadni qatt ma għandi għamilt xi ħaġa miegħek
It was just an idea.	Kienet biss idea.
After all, why not.	Wara kollox, għaliex le.
This may be the last time.	Din tista’ tkun l-aħħar darba.
Really.	Tassew.
I can't be like that	Ma nistax inkun hekk
I wanted it.	Ridt li.
I don’t want to think about it now.	Ma rridx naħseb dwarha issa.
Any chance ?.	Xi ċans?.
I really am.	Jien tassew.
I always thought about it	Dejjem ħsibt dwar dan
And another thing.	U ħaġa oħra.
She was so beautiful.	Kienet tant sabiħa.
I couldn't wait any longer	Ma kontx nistenna aktar
How could it be.	Kif seta jkun.
I thought please.	Ħsibt li jekk jogħġbok.
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
I really need some help	Verament għandi bżonn xi għajnuna
I'm there with you.	Jien hemm miegħek.
It has never taken so long before.	Qatt ma ħa daqshekk twil qabel.
I think you were right	Naħseb li kellek raġun
No one knows where he went.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn mar.
The only problem is who.	L-unika problema hija min.
It was like everything else.	Kienet bħal kull ħaġa oħra.
This comes later, but there is nothing before.	Dan jiġi aktar tard, imma m'hemm xejn qabel.
I would only be there for a few hours.	Inkun hemm biss għal ftit sigħat.
It was pretty big.	Kien pjuttost kbir.
Not sure here.	Mhux ċert hawn.
I didn't know what to believe.	Ma kontx naf x’se nemmen.
And that from.	U li minn.
This should be a big job.	Dan għandu jkun xogħol kbir.
No one else can be you.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jkun int.
It was so.	Kien hekk.
I could hardly do that	Kważi ma stajtx nagħmel dan
This was hard work.	Dan kien xogħol diffiċli.
But you never see that.	Imma qatt ma tara dan.
It's pretty easy.	Huwa pjuttost faċli.
Really happy for him.	Verament kuntent għalih.
I was hoping it was you	Kont qed nittama li kont int
I was tired of being tired all the time	Kont għajjien li nkun għajjien il-ħin kollu
There will never be.	Qatt ma jkun hemm.
He had never said anything like that before.	Hu qatt ma kien qal xi ħaġa bħal dik qabel.
Look at this.	Ħares lejn dan.
I have no idea where he is	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn hu
I have been here for years, alone	Ilni hawn snin, waħdi
It happens a lot.	Jiġri ħafna.
I already loved it	Diġà kont inħobb
I wasn't even tired	Jien lanqas kont għajjien
I want to say more.	Irrid li jgħid aktar.
That is not happening.	Dak mhux qed jiġri.
But there was no way.	Imma ma kien hemm l-ebda mod.
I was a little early	Kont ftit kmieni
You always can.	Dejjem tista'.
I just got so tired doing it	I biss għajjien tant tagħmel dan
I was happy about it	Kont kuntent dwar dan
It's much better.	Huwa ħafna aħjar.
I know a few friends who do that.	Naf ftit ħbieb li jagħmlu dan.
I will go and get a friend	Se mmur u nieħu ħabib
I couldn’t say the same for him	Ma stajtx ngħid l-istess għalih
I hadn’t heard anything for quite some time	Kont ma smajt xejn għal żmien mhux ħażin
I never told anyone about it	Qatt ma għedt xejn lil ħadd dwar dan
I hope you haven’t already come to this.	Nispera li mhux diġà wasal għal dan.
Not so.	Mhux hekk ġara.
Everything was done.	Kollox kien sar.
I wasn’t sure who would speak first	Ma kontx ċert min se jitkellem l-ewwel
It was never easy.	Qatt ma kien faċli.
I just hope otherwise	Nistenna biss mod ieħor
I never know when it might appear	Qatt ma naf meta jista’ jidher
I'll take something later.	Jien ser nieħu xi ħaġa aktar tard.
I’m not even sure what it is.	Jien lanqas ċert x'inhu.
I know this is not easy for you either	Naf li dan mhux faċli għalik lanqas
I had to come home earlier, that's all	I kellha tiġi d-dar aktar kmieni, dak kollox
He had just lost everything.	Kien għadu kif tilef kollox.
I didn’t know any of this	Jien ma kont naf xejn minn dan
Do or never will.	Tagħmel jew qatt se.
I would never have any things	Qatt ma kien ikolli xi affarijiet
But he didn't.	Imma hu ma.
I really want to talk to you	Irrid verament nitkellem miegħek
I need to understand who to tell	Għandi bżonn nifhem lil min ngħid
But we need your help !.	Imma għandna bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek!.
I think it will go very well	Naħseb li se jmur tajjeb ħafna
You know, you do.	Taf, inti tagħmel.
He was just a boy too.	Kien biss tifel ukoll.
I’m glad about that.	Jien ferħan b'dan.
I wanted to.	Jien kont ridt.
I think it wasn’t that bad	Naħseb li ma kienx daqshekk ħażin
Here and here.	Hawn u hawn.
I had to do this yesterday	Kelli nagħmel dan ilbieraħ
Only a few will do now.	Biss ftit se tagħmel issa.
I know something he doesn’t do	Naf xi ħaġa li ma jagħmilx
That might be a good thing.	Dik tista 'tkun ħaġa tajba.
Usually it’s just one at a time.	Normalment huwa wieħed biss kull darba.
I was no longer able to	Ma kontx aktar kapaċi
There is only way back from here.	Hemm biss mod lura minn hawn.
He never did that.	Qatt ma għamel hekk.
You were alone.	Int kont biss.
I couldn’t go as fast as I would.	Ma stajtx immur malajr kemm kieku.
All this I had seen before	Dan kollu kont rajt qabel
And we are ours.	U aħna tagħna.
You need great help.	Għandek bżonn għajnuna kbira.
It's his way.	Huwa mod tiegħu.
Just wanted to please.	Ridt biss jekk jogħġbok.
I have been here for some time.	Ilni hawn xi żmien.
I know too well how good you are.	Naf wisq tajjeb kemm int tajjeb.
He really didn't know.	Huwa tassew ma kienx jaf.
He will be everything, no one else will be anything.	Hu se jkun kollox, ħadd ieħor ma jkun xejn.
I doubt anyone would say so now	Niddubita li xi ħadd jgħid hekk issa
He said he would do it.	Qal li kien se jagħmel dan.
I will never understand this	Jien qatt mhu se nifhem dan
We don't even know what's going to happen.	Lanqas biss nafu x’se jiġri.
She knew that.	Hija kienet taf li.
I only did this once.	Għamilt dan darba biss.
You know.	Li taf.
When he died, we died.	Meta miet, aħna miet.
That was the truth.	Din kienet il-verità.
There were only two out here.	Kien hemm it-tnejn biss hawn barra.
That's for sure.	Dak żgur.
I saw one quickly	I deher wieħed malajr
I know that, she knows that.	Naf li, hi taf li.
You knew it was going to be there, of course.	Kont taf li kien se jkun hemm, ovvjament.
I think he should talk about it	Naħseb li għandu jitkellem dwarha
I want to know more than that	Irrid inkun naf aktar minn hekk
I'm sure you are too.	Jien ċert li int ukoll.
I really couldn't understand what happened	Verament ma stajtx nifhem x’ġara
I think not.	Naħseb li le.
First and only.	L-ewwel u l-uniku.
This can be hard to see.	Dan jista 'jkun diffiċli biex tara.
That time is not now.	Dak iż-żmien mhux issa.
That could be.	Li jista’ jkun.
Everything was going well.	Kollox kien sejjer tajjeb.
I did this yesterday and today	Dan għamilt il-bieraħ u llum
I already said that	Diġà għedt hekk
I can’t take more than that.	Ma nistax nieħu aktar minn dan.
Something can happen.	Jista' jiġri xi ħaġa.
I didn't think much of it	Ma tantx ħsibt
This can be.	Dan jista 'jkun.
Time could not have passed so quickly.	Iż-żmien ma setax għadda daqshekk malajr.
I want to have what I really want	Irrid li jkollu dak li verament irid
I thought that very well.	Ħsibt li tajjeb ħafna.
I should know better	Għandi naf aħjar
I don’t think anyone should live like that.	Ma naħsibx li ħadd għandu jgħix hekk.
I want to go back there someday	Irrid immur lura hemm xi darba
I think he was right.	Naħseb li kellu raġun.
I need to be alone for a while.	Għandi bżonn inkun waħdi għal xi żmien.
I think about it a lot.	Naħseb dwarha ħafna.
I'm sorry, but so be it.	Jiddispjaċini, imma hekk għandu jkun.
I had just come home	Kont għadni kemm ġejt id-dar
It can't just happen.	Ma jistax jiġri biss hekk.
Not even a man.	Lanqas raġel.
I’ve never been so alone	Qatt ma kont daqshekk waħdi
I’m not the same as a man.	Jien mhux l-istess bħal raġel.
It's too early.	Għadu kmieni.
he asked.	staqsa.
No one knows how it looked.	Ħadd ma jaf kif deher.
I wish he did.	Nixtieq li għamel.
I can say these two	Nista 'ngħid dawn it-tnejn
Few but not many	Ftit imma mhux ħafna
And that was enough.	U dan kien biżżejjed.
I was doing my job	Kont qed nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi
You were there last night.	Int kont hemm ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
You've been before.	Int kont qabel.
I don't think so.	Ma naħsibx.
But there was nothing to go back on.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn biex tmur lura.
I'm sure.	Jien ċert.
That's what they do.	Huwa dak li jagħmlu.
It was too much to take.	Kien wisq biex tieħu.
I need to go.	Għandi bżonn immur.
In fact, it's been a while.	Fil-fatt, ilu għal xi żmien.
I wasn't always afraid	Mhux dejjem kont nibża’
He doesn't know how.	Ma jafx kif.
That's how they felt.	Hekk ħassu.
It's that.	Huwa dak.
Not everyone was for this.	Mhux kulħadd kien għal dan.
Everything will help.	Kollox se jgħin.
Usually, very early in the morning.	Normalment, kmieni ħafna filgħodu.
It doesn’t have to be that hard.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
I was eating something	Kont niekol xi ħaġa
I didn't know what it was	Ma kontx naf x’kien
I know you're happy	Naf li int kuntent
I wasn’t around	Jien ma kontx madwar
So she did.	Hekk għamlet.
It is above all.	Huwa fuq kollox.
I couldn't see anything and I couldn't hear anything	Ma stajt nara xejn u ma nisma’ xejn
I like that.	Inħobb hekk.
You can do that.	Tista 'tagħmel dan.
I knew that if he came, he would leave	Kont naf li kieku tiġi, hu jitlaq
I did for a long time	Għamilt għal żmien twil
I want you to do something	Irrid li tagħmel xi ħaġa
I have to tell you something	Ikolli ngħidlek xi ħaġa
I really enjoyed it	Kont verament nieħu gost
He did not live forever.	Ma kienx jgħix għal dejjem.
But he’s just talking.	Imma hu biss li jitkellem.
But this could not be.	Imma dan ma setax ikun.
And it doesn’t come.	U mhux ġej.
I think that’s all we can do	Naħseb li dak kollu li nistgħu nagħmlu
I really want to be like that again	Irrid verament inkun hekk mill-ġdid
After all I was doing work	Wara kollox kont qed nagħmel xogħol
Very well, he would have had to go.	Tajjeb ħafna, kien ikollu jmur.
I wanted to be there early	Ridt inkun hemm kmieni
That was the truth.	Dik kienet il-verità.
We do a very good job.	Nagħmlu xogħol tajjeb ħafna.
How would this work.	Kif ikun dan ix-xogħol.
Well unlikely.	Ukoll mhux probabbli.
But it was never easy.	Imma qatt ma kienet faċli.
I get a chance.	Ikolli ċans.
I was so glad I was going	Kont tant ferħan li sejjer
I had a lot of problems	Kelli ħafna problemi
I thought, maybe.	Ħsibt, forsi.
I don't think you can.	Ma naħsibx li tista’.
No one wants to play with him.	Ħadd ma jrid jilgħab miegħu.
He is who and what you are.	Huwa min u dak li int.
But not the only one.	Imma mhux l-uniku wieħed.
I didn’t want to think	Ma ridtx naħseb
He needed something.	Huwa kellu bżonn xi ħaġa.
But we are just.	Imma aħna biss.
I thought I was alone	Ħsibt li ġejt waħdek
But he seemed happy to speak.	Imma deher kuntent li jitkellem.
I didn’t want to do that	Jien ma kontx ridt nagħmel hekk
Now, not so much.	Issa, mhux daqshekk.
I'm so.	Jien hekk.
I had no idea you would be here last night	Ma kellix idea li inti tkun hawn ilbieraħ filgħaxija
I want to tell you no	Irrid ngħidlek le
It has been very difficult.	Ġie diffiċli ħafna.
I couldn’t wait forever	Ma stajtx nistenna għal dejjem
I wanted this.	Jien ridt dan.
I couldn’t do it alone	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan waħdi
No one else was with us.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien magħna.
I need to know everything that is going on	Għandi bżonn inkun naf dak kollu li qed jiġri
She sure does.	Hija żgur li jagħmel.
I would be back for more	Inkun lura għal aktar
I did wrong.	Għamilt ħażin.
Are you for this ?.	Inti għal dan?.
I can only say so much.	Nista 'biss ngħid daqshekk.
I knew he was working late	Kont naf li kien qed jaħdem tard
That's what she does.	Dan hi tagħmel.
I want you to come with us	Irrid li tiġi magħna
More about our work.	Aktar dwar ix-xogħol tagħna.
Maybe to another.	Forsi lil ieħor.
I couldn’t do that again	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan mill-ġdid
I was very happy	Kont ferħan ħafna
He knew he would look good.	Kien jaf li kien se jidher tajjeb.
I hope it goes well today	Nispera li sejjer tajjeb illum
But you can't do that.	Imma int ma tistax tagħmel dan.
I need to think about it	Għandi bżonn naħseb dwar dan
It can work very quickly.	Jista 'jaħdem malajr ħafna.
That was good enough for me.	Dan kien tajjeb biżżejjed għalija.
Well just about.	Ukoll biss dwar.
I can't wait to go home	Ma nistax nistenna li mmur id-dar
She wants to know who he is.	Hija trid tkun taf min hu.
It will be much needed	Se jkun hemm bżonn ħafna
I didn’t know much about it	Ma kontx naf ħafna dwarha
You either do or you don’t.	Inti jew tagħmel jew ma tagħmilx.
I know you're there	Naf li int hemm
Nobody is.	Ħadd mhu.
To me this seems to work well.	Għalija dan jidher li jaħdem tajjeb.
We never seem to have enough time together.	Qatt ma jidher li għandna ħin biżżejjed flimkien.
I knew it would happen someday, but soon	Kont naf li jista’ jkun xi darba, imma mhux dalwaqt
I want to stay at my house	Irrid li toqgħod id-dar tiegħi
I really believe this	Verament nemmen dan
I need to believe it wasn’t	Għandi bżonn nemmen li ma kienx
This does not seem like much.	Dan ma jidhirx ħafna.
How difficult this is.	Kemm hu diffiċli dan.
So much money.	Tant flus.
I can't be happier	Ma nistax inkun kuntent
It was great.	Kien kbir.
Don't.	M'għandekx.
I didn't want to be like that	Ma ridtx inkun hekk
You know what's going to happen.	Taf x’se jiġri.
You know, you shouldn't do that.	Taf, m'għandekx tagħmel dan.
I don't want to be here at all	Ma rridx inkun hawn xejn
I think this has to happen.	Naħseb li dan ikollu jiġri.
She goes every year.	Hija tmur kull sena.
But not there.	Imma mhux hemm.
Back home.	Lura lejn id-dar.
That's really bad.	Dak tassew ħażin.
To make things easy.	Biex tieħu l-affarijiet faċli.
She had no friends.	Hija ma kellha l-ebda ħbieb.
She knew before we did.	Kienet taf qabel għamilna aħna.
Everyone just looked.	Kulħadd biss ħares.
I could never see	Qatt ma stajt nara
It was bad.	Kien ħażin.
There was another.	Kien hemm ieħor.
I think he’s happy about that	Naħseb li huwa kuntent dwar dan
Maybe that would be good.	Forsi dan ikun tajjeb.
We did that time and there.	Għamilna dak iż-żmien u hemm.
That would be something.	Dik kienet tkun xi ħaġa.
I wasn’t worried about anyone seeing it	Ma kontx inkwetat li xi ħadd jara
This can help.	Dan jista 'jgħin.
I have a son at home	Għandi tifel id-dar
He went home.	Huwa mar id-dar.
I have to wonder why.	Ikolli nistaqsi għaliex.
I have done this more than once.	Għamilt dan aktar minn darba.
This is so difficult.	Dan huwa tant diffiċli.
Better stay.	Aħjar toqgħod.
If the time comes.	Jekk jasal iż-żmien.
I didn’t want your first time to be like that	Ma ridtx li l-ewwel darba tiegħek tkun hekk
I can’t believe he just said that	Ma nistax nemmen li qal biss hekk
You were there.	Int kont hemm.
I was sure it was yours	Kont ċert li kien tiegħek
He will not say so.	Mhux se jgħid hekk.
Maybe not good, he thought.	Forsi mhux tajjeb, ħaseb.
It's a great idea.	Hija idea kbira.
I saw the same thing	Rajt l-istess ħaġa
This can be good or bad.	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb jew ħażin.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it happens.	Forsi mhux illum, forsi mhux għada, imma jiġri.
You have to tell me what you want.	Trid tgħidli x'inhi li trid.
I was telling this to someone else today	Jien kont qed ngħid dan lil xi ħadd ieħor illum
Both of them do very well.	It-tnejn li huma jagħmel tajjeb ħafna.
I thought how would you like to know	Ħsibt kif tixtieq tkun taf
I can do that, no one else	Jien nista' nagħmel dan, ħadd ieħor
I definitely think she is	Żgur naħseb li hi
I can’t say for sure now.	Ma nistax ngħid żgur issa.
I’ve definitely never heard of it	Żgur qatt ma smajt xejn dwarha
If not now, soon.	Jekk mhux issa, dalwaqt.
I’m not sure why you think you need one	M'inix ċert għaliex taħseb li għandek bżonn wieħed
Maybe you go with that ?.	Forsi tmur ma 'dak?.
We will do that.	Aħna ser nagħmlu dan.
Not where we are.	Mhux fejn aħna.
I didn’t know who they were.	Ma kontx naf min kienu.
I didn’t want to take any more.	Ma ridtx nieħu aktar.
You had to know when enough was enough.	Kellek tkun taf meta biżżejjed kien biżżejjed.
He said he was working for someone else.	Qal li kien qed jaħdem għal xi ħadd ieħor.
But it was too late.	Imma kien tard wisq.
It was just an idea	Kienet biss idea
I thought it might be too early	Ħsibt li jista 'jkun kmieni wisq
It's good now.	Huwa tajjeb issa.
I hope he knows this	Nispera li jaf dan
I will never do anything like this again	Qatt ma nagħmel aktar ħaġa bħal din
Maybe she knew what was coming next.	Forsi kienet taf x’kien ġej.
And it was more or less easy.	U kien xi ftit jew wisq faċli.
Here it comes.	Hawn ġej.
I’ve never heard anyone talk about how to do this before.	Qatt ma smajt lil ħadd jitkellem dwar kif isir dan qabel.
I just know something is going to happen	Naf biss li se jiġri xi ħaġa
I always seem to be the last one I know	Jien dejjem jidher li jien l-aħħar li naf
It was good, really good.	Kien tajjeb, tassew tajjeb.
I do whatever it takes to be happy	Nagħmel dak kollu li hemm bżonn biex inkun kuntent
He had come, but he probably wouldn't stay.	Kien ġie, imma probabbilment ma kienx se jibqa’.
It should be around in the morning.	Huwa għandu jiġi madwar filgħodu.
I need to tell someone, just once	Għandi bżonn ngħid lil xi ħadd, darba biss
I never thought it was so bad.	Qatt ma ħsibt li kien daqshekk ħażin.
Not to.	Mhux biex.
And he was right.	U kellu raġun.
It's not really.	Mhuwiex verament.
I know yours as well.	Jiena naf tiegħek ukoll.
Mine, not yours.	Tiegħi, mhux tiegħek.
I did nothing.	Ma għamilt xejn.
I knew this was it	Kont naf li dan kien
I thought this was just too easy	Ħsibt li dan kien ftit wisq faċli
I wasn't sure who she was talking to	Ma kontx ċert ma’ min kienet qed titkellem
You know that.	Int taf li.
No one knew why.	Ħadd ma kien jaf għaliex.
I thought a lot about that.	Ħsibt ħafna dwar dik.
You can do anything for me.	Inti tista 'tagħmel xejn għalija.
I think this is a great idea	Naħseb li din hija idea kbira
But neither.	Imma lanqas.
You must be happy.	Trid tkun kuntent.
It was never good.	Qatt ma kien tajjeb.
You need to do more than that.	Jeħtieġ li tagħmel aktar minn hekk.
He was unemployed.	Huwa kien bla xogħol.
I see you've about finished that one	Nara li inti stajt madwar lest dak wieħed
Well, you should.	Ukoll, għandek.
I don't know anything about that	Jien ma naf xejn dwar dan
But not so difficult.	Imma mhux daqshekk diffiċli.
It could be the same one.	Jista 'jkun l-istess waħda.
I will not make this easy for you	Mhux se nagħmel dan faċli għalik
I am very sorry for this.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal dan.
That’s a lot for you to do.	Dak huwa ħafna għalik li tagħmel.
The only thing we can do.	L-unika ħaġa li nistgħu nagħmlu.
I think that’s a good thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx.
Well, so, so.	Ukoll, hekk, hekk.
I wasn’t talking to him.	Jien ma kontx qed nitkellem miegħu.
But please, do nothing.	Imma jekk jogħġbok, tagħmel xejn.
We’ve had problems lately.	Kellna problemi dan l-aħħar.
If anyone is interested.	Jekk xi ħadd hu interessat.
It wasn’t much.	Ma kienx ħafna.
I hope all is well	Nispera li kollox ikun tajjeb
I was happy for him.	Kien kuntent għalih.
Which certainly wasn’t often.	Li żgur ma kienx spiss.
I wish I had never been here	Nixtieq li qatt ma ġejt hawn
Just like you did.	Hekk kif għamilt int.
I don’t want that to happen here	Ma rridx li jiġri hawn
This happens on its own.	Dan jiġri waħdu.
She was not doing anything wrong.	Ma kienet qed tagħmel xejn ħażin.
You know.	Taf.
I wasn’t so surprised	Ma kellix daqshekk sorpriż
He never had and never had.	Qatt ma kellu u qatt ma kellu.
I want you to be with us today.	Nixtieq li tkun magħna llum.
Can anyone please help.	Jista' xi ħadd jekk jogħġbok jgħin.
I knew what he was up to	Kont naf x’kien qed jippjana
I didn’t do very well.	Ma tantx għamilt tajjeb.
I can do that	Jien nista' nagħmel dan
Well, nothing goes here.	Ukoll, hawn ma jmur xejn.
I have never had one before.	Qatt ma kelli qabel.
But something tells me.	Imma xi ħaġa tgħidli.
He had told me a lot about it.	Huwa kien qalli ħafna dwar dan.
Good to see when everything has been seen.	Tajjeb biex tara meta kollox ikun deher.
I hope you are too.	Nittama li int ukoll.
She needed it too.	Hija kellha bżonn wisq.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
I will have to go for a while	Ikolli mmur għal xi żmien
I need your help now	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek issa
It is not enough.	Mhuwiex biżżejjed.
Not just us, but everyone.	Mhux aħna biss, imma kulħadd.
Well, maybe we should.	Ukoll, forsi għandna.
I have no idea where he is.	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn hu.
But why are you so interested now.	Imma għaliex inti tant interessat issa.
I do all these things and more	Nagħmel dawn l-affarijiet kollha u aktar
I would be here if you need anything.	Jien inkun hawn jekk għandek bżonn xi ħaġa.
This is hard enough.	Dan huwa diffiċli biżżejjed.
I hope you see what I say ?.	Nispera li tara xi ngħid?.
I definitely hope he does.	Żgur nittama li jagħmel.
I can't do anything	Ma nista nagħmel xejn
In fact, it is very good for you.	Fil-fatt, huwa tajjeb ħafna għalik.
I did it before	Għamilt qabel
We need to know, you say, what happened.	Għandna bżonn li tkun taf, int tgħid, x'ġara.
I was thinking so	Jien kont qed naħseb hekk
I never could.	Qatt ma stajt.
You can't eat just one.	Ma tistax tiekol wieħed biss.
It was a good one.	Kienet waħda tajba.
I want to know if it's okay	Irrid inkun naf li hu tajjeb
It must be the same man.	Għandu jkun l-istess raġel.
After a few years you only know.	Wara ftit snin taf biss.
I can’t believe it’s been so long	Ma nistax nemmen li diġà ilu daqshekk
I hope he hasn’t left already	Nispera li ma jkunx telaq diġà
She is here with me now.	Hija hawn miegħi issa.
It wasn't going very well.	Ma kienx sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
Another problem.	Problema oħra.
It seemed more like.	Deher aktar bħal .
I’m ready for this job	Jien lest għal dan ix-xogħol
I’ve always done my own thing	Jien dejjem kont nagħmel l-affarijiet tiegħi
I thought everyone knew	Ħsibt li kulħadd kien jaf
And this is yours.	U dan huwa tiegħek.
I still think about it.	Għadni naħseb dwarha.
Everything was going well.	Kollox kien sejjer tajjeb.
Many people are making a lot of money.	Ħafna nies qed jagħmlu ħafna flus.
I have nothing wrong to say about it.	M'għandi xejn ħażin xi ngħid dwarha.
The timing will never be exact.	Iż-żmien qatt mhu se jkun eżatt.
Come on, you know what you want.	Ejja, taf li trid.
I had nothing to say	Jien ma kelli ngħid xejn
It won't be.	Mhux se jkun.
I don't want to.	Ma rridx.
It was definitely something everyone was thinking about.	Żgur li kienet xi ħaġa li kulħadd kien jaħseb.
And that will be the problem.	U dik se tkun il-problema.
I never was and probably never will be.	Qatt ma kont u probabbilment qatt ma nkun.
It's a beautiful thing.	Hija ħaġa sabiħa.
It was still too early to tell.	Kien għadu kmieni wisq biex tgħid.
I didn't hear anything	Jien ma smajt xejn
She looked good now, she thought.	Issa kienet tidher tajba, ħaseb.
Few other people do	Ftit nies oħra jagħmlu
Mod.	Mod.
It should be.	Għandu jkun.
I never seemed to have that problem before I left.	Qatt ma deher li kelli dik il-problema qabel ma mort.
He looked at us.	Huwa ħares magħna.
I’ve probably eaten a lot from another	Probabbilment stajt tiekol ħafna minn ieħor
I almost made it home as well	Kważi għamilt id-dar ukoll
Never before has there been such a chance.	Qatt qabel ma kien hemm ċans bħal dan.
Everyone was gone.	Kulħadd kien telaq.
I can't really.	Ma nistax verament.
I couldn’t believe what had just happened	Ma stajtx nemmen dak li kien għadu kif ġara
It was never you.	Qatt ma kont int.
I already knew that.	Diġà kont naf li.
Tell me who did it.	Tgħidli min kien li għamel dan.
You were right.	Kellek raġun.
I can tell you I want to talk.	Nista 'ngħidlek tixtieq titkellem.
Lots of money together	Ħafna flus flimkien
Just more than what you see here.	Biss aktar minn dak li tara hawn.
He said he wasn't.	Qal li ma kienx.
But you don’t have to.	Imma m'għandekx.
She is very beautiful.	Hija sabiħa ħafna.
This never happens.	Dan qatt ma jiġri.
I had to do it	Kelli nagħmel dan
Or rather, you can't.	Jew aħjar, ma tistax.
I think it might work	Naħseb li jista 'jaħdem
He said he knew a man.	Qal li kien jaf raġel.
These she did.	Dawn hi għamlet.
It was still early.	Kien għadu kmieni.
I wish you knew.	Nixtieq li kienet taf.
But anything can happen !.	Imma kollox jista' jiġri!.
I never thought that	Qatt ma ħsibt li
I knew it wasn’t really.	Kont naf li ma kienx verament.
I could see she was thinking	Stajt nara li kienet qed taħseb
I just hope to be so good someday	Nispera biss li xi darba nkun daqshekk tajjeb
He thought back.	Huwa ħaseb lura.
Good here.	Tajjeb hawn.
It's just.	Huwa biss.
I could hear him talking.	Stajt nisma’ jitkellem.
But it is not so.	Imma mhux hekk hu.
Tom returned a little.	Tom lura ftit.
I’m not staying here anymore	Jien m'iniex noqgħod aktar hawn
I had no idea who they were	Ma kellix idea min kienu
I have to really go now	Ikolli verament immur issa
And you.	U inti.
I also had a good time	Jien ukoll kelli żmien tajjeb
So be it.	Hekk ikun.
I was having trouble seeing and hearing	Kont qed ikolli problemi biex nara, kif ukoll nisma’
I will definitely do it again	Żgur li se nerġa' nagħmel
For me this is great.	Għalija dan huwa kbir.
She knew it had to be the first thing she had to go.	Kienet taf li kellha tkun l-ewwel ħaġa li kellha tmur.
Forever appeared.	Għal dejjem deher.
She wants to be friends.	Hija trid tkun ħbieb.
You were alone.	Int kont biss.
They and we so.	Huma u aħna hekk.
I'm so sorry but I couldn't wait	Jiddispjaċini ħafna imma dan ma setax jistenna
I think you're good at it	Naħseb li int tajjeb għalih
I have no idea how well this works.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kemm dan jaħdem tajjeb.
A man did things alone	Raġel għamel l-affarijiet waħdu
Something had happened.	Kien ġara xi ħaġa.
He came out.	Huwa ħareġ.
This is a very difficult problem for me.	Din hija problema diffiċli ħafna għalija.
I know I wasn’t.	Naf li ma kontx.
Usually, he does one or the other.	Normalment, jagħmel waħda jew oħra.
I have a lot to say about.	Għandi ħafna xi ngħid dwar.
I wasn't ready to hear how worried he was	Ma kontx lest nisma’ kemm kien inkwetat
Many years ago in fact.	Ħafna snin ilu fil-fatt.
We are friends now.	Aħna ħbieb issa.
No one else seems to have one.	Ħadd ieħor jidher li għandu wieħed.
It won't be big.	Mhux se jibqa’ kbir.
I was very happy	Kont kuntent ħafna
I don't know what happened to me.	Ma nafx x’ġara lili.
I'm very happy.	Jien kuntent ħafna.
But little.	Imma ftit.
Or never be.	Jew qatt ikun.
He will be fine.	Hu se jkun tajjeb.
I have no idea where that came from.	M'għandi l-ebda idea minn fejn ġie dak.
Unless you like that.	Sakemm inti bħal dik.
It’s all or nothing here.	Huwa kollox jew xejn hawn.
I just have to think about something else.	Ikolli biss naħseb dwar xi ħaġa oħra.
She says this is not the first time she has done so.	Hija tgħid li din mhix l-ewwel darba li jagħmel dan.
You better be there when she does.	Aħjar int hemm meta hi tagħmel.
I need a little more time.	Għandi bżonn ftit aktar ħin.
I had a hard time with this	Kelli żmien diffiċli b'dan
And it was good for me.	U kienet tajba għalija.
I've never seen one before	Qatt ma rajt waħda qabel
You are not saying.	M'intix tgħid.
I still can't believe what's going on	Għadni ma nistax nemmen x’qed jiġri
Not three years later.	Le tliet snin wara.
He said he would.	Huwa qal li kieku.
It's late afternoon.	Huwa tard wara nofsinhar.
I never talk about it.	Jien qatt ma nitkellem dwarha.
That is enough.	Dan huwa biżżejjed.
I couldn't hear	Ma kontx nisma’
Now I know how bad it is	Issa naf kemm hu ħażin
I believe it is the same for everyone	Nemmen li huwa l-istess għal kull wieħed
This is very, very, very bad.	Dan huwa ħażin ħafna, ħafna, ħafna.
I can do this at home myself.	Jien nista’ nagħmel dan id-dar jien.
And it will be.	U se jkun.
I can tell you one thing.	Nista’ ngħidlek ħaġa waħda.
I didn’t have one for myself	Jien ma kellix waħda għalija
I used to do the same	Jien kont nagħmel l-istess
I'm not going.	Mhux sejjer.
A little that, now.	Ftit li, issa.
I didn't have to listen	Ma kellix bżonn nisma’ nitkellem
Everyone knows this.	Kulħadd jaf dan.
I was actually with him.	Fil-fatt kont miegħu.
This will happen.	Dan se jiġri.
But that’s not all.	Imma dak mhux kollox.
This is great, you think.	Dan huwa kbir, taħseb.
I just want one.	Nixtieq wieħed biss.
It was so.	Kien hekk.
There is nothing more.	M'hemm xejn aktar.
Or he says he thought so.	Jew jgħid li ħaseb hekk.
And it couldn’t be easier.	U ma jistax ikun aktar faċli.
That's it.	Dak hu .
That was it.	Hekk kien kien.
I thought it would be difficult	Ħsibt li jkun diffiċli
I think he speaks for himself !.	Naħseb li titkellem waħdu!.
I have to do well.	Għandi nagħmel tajjeb.
Nothing happened, which was good.	Ma ġara xejn, li kien tajjeb.
I didn’t believe it, of course	Ma kontx nemmen, ovvjament
I go back.	Immur lura.
One for you, one for me.	Waħda għalik, waħda għalija.
And it was very beautiful.	U kienet sabiħa ħafna.
But it doesn’t seem to work.	Imma ma jidhirx li jaħdem.
No one knew he was going.	Ħadd ma kien jaf li kien sejjer.
He didn't want you to do that.	Ma riedx li tkun qed tagħmel hekk.
Not us.	Mhux aħna.
That was it.	Dan kien dan.
This week will be better.	Din il-ġimgħa se tkun aħjar.
He was with me.	Kien miegħi.
He knew what was coming.	Kien jaf x’kien ġej.
Like this.	Bħal dan.
I need time.	Għandi bżonn il-ħin.
It couldn’t help but.	Ma setax jgħin imma.
But there was no one in the room.	Imma ma kien hemm ħadd fil-kamra.
He went.	Huwa mar.
It’s just the same for me.	Huwa biss l-istess għalija.
I thought nothing more about it.	Ma ħsibt xejn aktar dwarha.
Many times more than that.	Ħafna drabi aktar minn hekk.
I have to do my job	Ikolli nagħmel xogħol tiegħi
I want to go first.	Nixtieq li tmur l-ewwel.
He went and asked.	Mar u staqsa.
That wasn't over.	Li ma kienx fuq.
But don't say anything.	Imma ma tgħid xejn.
I want to say something.	Irrid ngħid xi ħaġa.
There is a time when you want nothing.	Hemm żmien meta ma trid xejn.
I have a way of knowing such things now.	Għandi mod kif inkun naf affarijiet bħal dawn issa.
What he will do is come to my house.	Dak li se tagħmel hu li tiġi d-dar tiegħi.
I could never hold back	Qatt ma stajt noqgħod lura
I knew there was something	Kont naf li kien hemm xi ħaġa
If necessary.	Jekk ikun hemm bżonn.
We have to do it again, he said.	Għandna nagħmlu dan mill-ġdid, qal.
If you do, this is for you.	Jekk tagħmel hekk, dan hu għalik.
I don't know.	Jien ma nafx.
She never had a chance.	Hija qatt ma kellha ċans.
I wasn’t there when it happened.	Jien ma kontx hemm meta ġara.
You are going so.	Int sejjer hekk.
She knows better.	Hija taf aħjar.
To see how it was.	Biex tara kif kienet.
He always seems to know everyone.	Jidher li dejjem jaf lil kulħadd.
I should be able to say more next week	Għandi nkun kapaċi ngħid aktar il-ġimgħa d-dieħla
I know exactly where she is.	Naf eżatt fejn hi.
I couldn’t tell who they were.	Ma stajtx ngħid min kienu.
I couldn’t believe it at all.	Ma stajtx nemmen għal kollox.
Just as I wanted.	Eżatt kif ridt.
I didn't know how to do that	Ma kontx naf kif dan jista’ jkun
This will do.	Dan se jagħmel.
I heard about it yesterday	Smajt dwarha lbieraħ
Almost everyone thought so.	Kważi kulħadd ħaseb hekk.
I didn’t know I was still together	Ma kontx naf li kont għadek flimkien
I don’t know how to do that.	Ma nafx kif jagħmel dan.
All well and good.	Kollox tajjeb u tajjeb.
Nor would she make mine.	Lanqas ma kienet tagħmel tiegħi.
I eat well.	niekol tajjeb.
For a long time.	Għal żmien twil.
That was a good thing.	Din kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
I didn’t want to tell you this	Ma ridtx ngħidlek dan
We don't make a lot of money, and never do.	Aħna ma jagħmlu ħafna flus, u qatt ma.
And another one.	U waħda oħra.
Is that so ?.	Huwa hekk?.
It was the only way, you know.	Kien l-uniku mod, taf.
I only have one of them	Jien għandi wieħed biss minni
But someone will do it.	Imma xi ħadd se jagħmel dan.
This may take some time.	Dan jista' jieħu xi żmien.
It now works without a problem.	Issa jaħdem mingħajr problema.
I really couldn't get what he was saying	Verament ma stajtx nieħu dak li kien qed jgħid
I’m really sorry it has to be that way	Jiena tassew jiddispjaċini li jrid ikun hekk
It doesn't have to be that way.	M'għandux ikun hekk.
I know it wasn't all yours, but	Naf li ma kienx kollu tiegħek, imma
And he or she is right.	U hu jew hi għandu raġun.
I need to know what's going on	Għandi bżonn inkun naf x’qed jiġri
I love going to your house	Inħobb immur id-dar tiegħek
Either you are or you are not.	Jew int jew m'intix.
I just want to be sure	Irrid biss li tkun ċert
That’s not great.	Dak mhux kbir.
It was really beautiful.	Kienet tassew sabiħa ħafna.
I just can’t go for that.	Jien biss ma nistax immur għal dak.
I'm not, he said.	Jien mhux, qal.
I knew this was going to be really bad.	Kont naf li dan kien se jkun tassew ħażin.
I never had to say that	Qatt ma kelli ngħid hekk
Never, ever, did I want anything like this to happen	Qatt, qatt, ridt li jiġri xi ħaġa minn dan
He is staying with a friend tonight.	Huwa joqgħod ma 'ħabib illejla.
I was already worried that I might	Diġà kont inkwetat li seta’
I meant.	Ried ngħid.
I knew it was good.	Kont naf li kien tajjeb.
But not everyone does.	Imma mhux kull wieħed jagħmel.
I didn’t want to believe it	Ma ridtx nemmen
It looked like it was going to be his last job	Deher li kien se jkun l-aħħar xogħol tiegħu
I was just wondering why it is so	Kont biss nistaqsi għaliex hu hekk
Well, well, so it is.	Ukoll, tajjeb, hekk hu.
I can't be with you anymore	Ma nistax inkun aktar miegħek
I couldn’t believe how quickly it had happened	Ma stajtx nemmen kemm kien ġara malajr
It happened a long time ago.	Ġara żmien twil ilu.
And he left.	U telaq.
That he was thinking about it now.	Li kien qed jaħseb dwarha issa.
I need to be alone for a while	Għandi bżonn inkun waħdi għal ftit
Nothing every time.	Xejn kull darba.
They will make things difficult.	Huma se jagħmlu l-affarijiet diffiċli.
Now comes the first.	Issa jiġi l-ewwel.
You must too.	Int trid ukoll.
There are a few people here.	Hemm ftit nies hawn.
This also works smoothly.	Dan jaħdem ukoll mingħajr problemi.
I believe he did so.	Nemmen li għamel hekk.
And another man.	U raġel ieħor.
I never do that	Jien qatt ma nagħmel hekk
I shouldn't be telling you any of this	M'għandi nkun qed ngħidlek xejn minn dan
And so it happened here.	U hekk ġara hawn.
I make one for you.	Jien nagħmel waħda għalik.
It couldn't be easier.	Ma setax ikun aktar faċli.
Not very well, but she was doing it.	Mhux tajjeb ħafna, imma kienet qed tagħmel dan.
I will never be a good enough man.	Qatt mhu se nkun raġel tajjeb biżżejjed.
This is definitely better.	Dan żgur huwa aħjar.
Not there yet.	Għadu mhux hemm.
I should do this more often	Għandi nagħmel dan aktar spiss
I want it to be fast.	Nixtieq li jkun malajr.
Much more than there should be	Ħafna aktar milli għandu jkun hemm
He had done wrong.	Huwa kien għamel ħażin.
Often, in fact.	Ħafna drabi, fil-fatt.
But he is not.	Imma hu mhux hekk.
I can do that.	Jien nista' nagħmel dan.
I know how hard it is	Naf kemm hu diffiċli
You can't do that.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan.
I don’t like much of anyone right now	Ma nħobbx ħafna minn ħadd bħalissa
He knew what to do.	Kien jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
I can tell he doesn't want to	Nista’ ngħid li ma jridx
I made it my home.	Jien għamilt id-dar tiegħi.
I want to be the one to do that	Irrid inkun dak li jagħmel dan
He didn’t have to.	Ma kellux għalfejn.
This is not a problem.	Din mhix problema.
I try.	Nipprova.
I said so she was going to say no, but no.	Jien għidt hekk hi kienet se tgħid le, imma le.
More things happen.	Jiġri aktar affarijiet.
Maybe too much.	Forsi wisq.
I look forward to talking to you	Nistenna li titkellem miegħi
I had to do it alone	Kelli nagħmel dan waħdi
I need to know, once and for all	Għandi bżonn inkun naf, darba għal dejjem
I wanted to have a child	Ridt li jkun hemm tifel
You want to take more.	Trid tieħu aktar.
Do as you wish.	Tagħmel kif tixtieq.
A little bit.	Ftit ftit.
You are better today than you were yesterday.	Inti aħjar illum milli kont ilbieraħ.
I was so scared to do this.	Kont tant nibża nagħmel dan.
Can you go back there, please.	Tista' tmur lura hemm, jekk jogħġbok.
One child looked like a man.	Tifel wieħed kien qisu raġel.
So it was for me.	Hekk kien għalija.
I’m not saying you can’t	Mhux qed ngħid li ma tistax
I didn't know what it was.	Ma kontx naf x’kien.
I didn’t even have that	Jien lanqas biss kelli dak
And this is not always easy.	U dan mhux dejjem faċli.
Not sure exactly why or how.	Mhux ċert eżatt għaliex jew kif.
He won’t be back here for a few hours.	Mhux se jkun lura hawn għal ftit sigħat.
I don’t always understand.	Jien mhux dejjem nifhem.
It’s not big and it’s not small.	Mhuwiex kbir u mhux żgħir.
You don’t have to talk about it.	M'għandekx għalfejn titkellem dwarha.
I was glad to see everyone happy	Kont ferħan nara lil kulħadd kuntent
I’m not going to eat at home for a while	Jien mhux se niekol id-dar għal xi żmien
I love everything you do	Inħobb dak kollu li tagħmel
I only speak the truth	Jien nitkellem biss il-verità
I was waiting for someone else	Jien kont qed nistenna lil xi ħadd ieħor
I didn’t think it was going to be that hard	Ma kontx naħseb li se jkun daqshekk diffiċli
Nothing was done.	Ma sar xejn.
You know a lot, it seems.	Inti taf ħafna, jidher.
I don’t have to stay long.	M'għandix noqgħod twil.
I did so.	Jien għamilt hekk.
There was no one.	Ma kien hemm ħadd.
I needed to be ready	Kelli bżonn inkun lest
I didn’t even want to see it that way.	Lanqas ridt nara hekk.
It was just the truth.	Kienet biss il-verità.
There was nothing on.	Ma kien hemm xejn fuq.
And this is what happens.	U dan huwa dak li jiġri.
Tired of sitting there for so long	Għajjien bilqiegħda hemm għal tant żmien
Look no further.	Ħares aktar.
There is nothing.	M'hemm xejn.
I had no chance	Ma kelli l-ebda ċans
I didn’t want to be good either.	Lanqas jien ma ridt inkun tajjeb.
I understand it’s hard for you	Nifhem li huwa diffiċli għalik
I knew it would happen again.	Kont naf li se jerġa’ jiġri.
I want to go do everything with you	Irrid immur nagħmel kollox miegħek
I didn't know what was good or bad	Ma kontx naf x’inhu tajjeb jew ħażin
I will be here for you	Ikolli nkun hawn għalik
He couldn't go back now.	Huwa ma setax lura issa.
But this is not enough.	Imma dan mhux biżżejjed.
That she was.	Li hi kienet.
We have to go, 'he said.	Għandna mmorru,' qal.
Look.	Ħares.
I have been here a few times	Ilni hawn xi ftit drabi
She says nothing.	Hija ma tgħid xejn.
It's very good.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna.
He never asked for anything.	Hu qatt ma talab xejn.
I believe it was only one-off.	Nemmen li kien biss ta' darba.
I already know enough	Diġà naf biżżejjed
No one was home at the time.	Ħadd ma kien id-dar dak iż-żmien.
Many times, they were better.	Ħafna drabi, kienu aħjar.
I really thought they were better than that	Verament ħsibt li kienu aħjar minn hekk
I can't be with one person	Ma nistax inkun ma' persuna waħda
I just want to go home	Irrid biss immur id-dar
I think he is telling the truth	Naħseb li qed jgħid il-verità
Well, almost no one.	Ukoll, kważi ħadd.
But there it was.	Imma kien hemm.
She does this often.	Hija tagħmel dan spiss.
And we did.	U għamilna.
You have to do better than that.	Inti għandek tagħmel aħjar minn hekk.
Maybe just a few hours.	Forsi biss ftit sigħat.
When school comes.	Meta jiġi l-iskola.
It could just be me.	Jista 'jkun biss jien.
But look at this.	Imma ħares lejn dan.
.	.
I just never did.	Jien biss qatt ma għamilt.
I know she is with you	Naf li hi miegħek
I will always be here for you.	Jien dejjem se nkun hawn għalik.
Well, that wasn't going to happen.	Ukoll, dan ma kienx se jiġri.
They were just there.	Kienu hemm biss.
I have none of that.	Jien m'għandi xejn minn hekk.
It’s not about what you can’t do.	Mhux dwar dak li ma tistax tagħmel.
I think everyone knows who he is.	Naħseb li kulħadd jaf min hu.
I want to go home	Irrid lura d-dar
And maybe that’s a good thing.	U forsi dik hija ħaġa tajba.
If you're not better by then.	Jekk int ma tkunx aħjar sa dak iż-żmien.
His work was before me.	Ix-xogħol tiegħu kien qabel tiegħi.
No one knew his.	Ħadd ma kien jaf tiegħu.
But so did yours.	Imma hekk għamel dak tiegħek.
I don’t have that.	Jien m'għandix dak.
I’m out at work tomorrow.	Jien barra fuq ix-xogħol għada.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
I thought this would be easy	Ħsibt li dan ikun faċli
Yesterday was a good first chance.	Ilbieraħ kien l-ewwel ċans tajjeb.
Until the end.	Sa l-aħħar.
So we did now.	Hekk għamilna issa.
It's out.	Huwa barra.
Soon, he would say.	Dalwaqt, kien jgħid.
I'll try.	Jien ser nipprova.
If you want, you can't say anything.	Jekk trid, ma tista’ tgħid xejn.
He was still with him, maybe he always would be.	Kien għadu miegħu, forsi dejjem ikun.
I just need a little help.	Għandi bżonn biss ftit għajnuna.
I wonder what it is	Nistaqsi x’inhu
Now it's done.	Issa qed isir.
No one will be able to see anything from the outside.	Ħadd ma jkun jista’ jara xejn minn barra.
Never had before.	Qatt ma kellu qabel.
He could see that now.	Huwa seta 'jara li issa.
Well, not me exactly.	Ukoll, mhux jien eżatt.
I didn't hear anything	Ma smajt xejn
I knew it was coming.	Kont naf li kien ġej.
I want to try again tomorrow morning	Irrid nerġa' nipprova għada filgħodu
I have to believe that.	Ikolli nemmen li.
It was too good for that.	Kienet wisq tajba għal dan.
That’s what’s happening.	Dak hu li qed jiġri.
I just need to make time.	Għandi bżonn biss nagħmel il-ħin.
Well, she thinks.	Tajjeb, taħseb hi.
I think he needs a friend.	Naħseb li għandu bżonn ħabib.
A little.	Ftit.
I couldn’t just stay here	Jien ma stajtx biss noqgħod hawn
If not, this may be your last chance.	Jekk le dan jista 'jkun l-aħħar ċans tiegħek.
I can't be with you	Ma nistax inkun miegħek
Everything looks good.	Kollox jidher tajjeb.
I want to talk about it.	Irrid nitkellem dwarha.
I really hope you can as well	Verament nittama li inti tista 'kif hekk
He must have.	Irid ikollu.
I think that’s what makes it work	Naħseb li dan huwa dak li tagħmel ix-xogħol
We know where they are.	Nafu fejn huma.
Come on, 'he said.	Ejja,’ qal.
Now let me tell you something.	Issa ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
And another after that.	U ieħor wara dan.
Everything looked good, but something was very wrong.	Kollox deher tajjeb, imma xi ħaġa kienet ħażina ħafna.
I couldn’t believe it anymore	Ma kontx nemmen aktar
I loved it at the time.	Kont inħobb dak iż-żmien.
Not sure why this happens.	Mhux ċert għaliex jiġri dan.
I'll tell you why.	Jien ngħidlek għaliex.
I wasn’t talking to myself, there was someone else	Jien ma kontx qed nitkellem jien, kien hemm xi ħadd ieħor
I haven't seen any yet	Għadni ma rajt l-ebda waħda
I didn’t want to talk about what had just happened	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwar dak li kien għadu kif ġara
But there was something else.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
I can't believe this	Ma nistax nemmen dan
It looked good.	Deher tajjeb.
I definitely need to talk to him.	Żgur li għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħu.
I want to go home now please	Irrid immur id-dar issa jekk jogħġbok
Not really very good, but really very bad.	Mhux tassew tajjeb ħafna, imma tassew ħażin ħafna.
I knew it was probably nothing	Kont naf li probabbilment kien xejn
That was well said.	Dan kien qal tajjeb.
But it wasn’t really the same.	Imma ma kienx l-istess verament.
I don’t like it here anymore	Ma nħobbx hawn aktar
I need your help please	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek jekk jogħġbok
I'm sorry to say that	Jiddispjaċini nagħmel dan
He didn't know any other way.	Ma kien jaf xi mod ieħor kif ikun.
Well, she had that too.	Ukoll, hija kellha dan ukoll.
I know you have to do it	Naf li għandek tagħmel dan
No, it's not that.	Le, mhuwiex dak.
I will be doing this a lot	Dan se nkun qed nagħmel ħafna
I can't do it anymore.	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar.
Everyone has one.	Kulħadd għandu wieħed.
I was very young at the time	Dak iż-żmien kont żgħir ħafna
You were one of many.	Inti kont wieħed minn ħafna.
I wonder who did that	Nistaqsi min għamel hekk
You never had to stay home.	Qatt ma kellek toqgħod id-dar.
I don't need anything	M'għandi bżonn xejn
I’m having a good time right now, here	Qed nagħmel ħin tajjeb bħalissa, hawn
I was wondering this myself	Jien kont qed nistaqsi dan jien
And how much did she have, really? 	U kemm kellha, tassew?
That too he cannot do.	Dan ukoll ma jistax jagħmel.
But it was all me.	Imma kien kollu jien.
I wish she was here now.	Nixtieq li kienet hawn issa.
I just couldn't take it anymore	I biss ma stajtx tieħu dan aktar
I think you need something	Naħseb li għandek bżonn xi ħaġa
He had never gone through anything like that.	Hu qatt ma kien għadda minn xi ħaġa bħal dik.
Definitely not mine.	Żgur li mhux tiegħi.
I want to see what's more out there	Irrid nara x'hemm aktar hemmhekk
Like, really fun.	Bħal, verament gost.
This may or may not work for you.	Dan jista 'jew ma jistax jaħdem għalik.
Tired but good.	Għajjien imma tajjeb.
That was much more than enough.	Dan kien ħafna aktar minn biżżejjed.
I went here to go to school.	Mort hawn biex immur l-iskola.
There can only be one more.	Jista 'jkun hemm biss ieħor.
I never want to be him again.	Qatt ma rrid inkun hu mill-ġdid.
I just know what he's thinking	Naf biss x’qed jaħseb
If you were there, you would know.	Kieku kont kont hemm, kont taf.
I was glad I was there.	Kont ferħan li kont hemm.
I enjoy talking to everyone.	Jien nieħu gost nitkellem ma' kulħadd.
He was thinking fast.	Kien qed jaħseb malajr.
There was nothing more	Ma kien hemm xejn aktar
There was not enough.	Ma kienx hemm biżżejjed.
I had to sit there and wait	Kelli noqgħod hemm u nistenna
That will not happen.	Dak mhux se jiġri.
I have nothing like this	M'għandi xejn bħal dan
I don't want to live alone	Ma rridx jibqa’ jgħix waħdu
But there must be more than that.	Imma jrid ikun hemm aktar minn hekk.
I hope this works	Nispera li dan se jaħdem
I never had to take this job	Qatt ma kelli nieħu dan ix-xogħol
He had come to help, and help was.	Huwa kien ġie biex jgħin, u jgħin kien.
That was really great.	Dak kien tassew kbir.
He was very good to me.	Kien tajjeb ħafna miegħi.
This we both knew.	Dan it-tnejn konna nafu.
I want it to be	Nixtieq li tiġi
But she says nothing to anyone.	Imma tgħid xejn lil ħadd.
He said he was.	Huwa qal li kien.
Maybe not too much.	Forsi mhux wisq.
And she just does.	U hi biss.
I know where you are doing this	Naf fejn qed tagħmel dan
I want to see me.	Irrid nara jien.
I will try to make one	Jien ser nipprova nagħmel waħda
And I was supposed to be his friend.	U suppost kont ħabib tiegħu.
You want to do this with a great man.	Trid tagħmel dan ma 'raġel kbir.
Apparently she had done this before.	Jidher li kienet għamlet dan qabel.
I knew it was going to be hard	Kont naf li kien se jkun diffiċli
And so it happened.	U hekk ġara.
Probably not much.	Probabbilment mhux ħafna.
He never knew that.	Qatt ma kien jaf li.
I haven’t thought about it forever	Jien ma ħsibt dwar dan għal dejjem
I didn’t want to be alone anymore	Ma ridtx inkun aktar waħdi
I will have to do more.	Ikolli nagħmel aktar.
I never thought it would happen so quickly	Qatt qatt ma ħsibt li se jiġri daqshekk malajr
I know a lot about it	Naf ħafna dwarha
I just wasn't interested	I biss ma kienx interessat
He wasn’t going to go any further.	Ma kienx se jmur aktar.
A man is not supposed to need much.	Raġel mhux suppost jeħtieġ ħafna.
And it is working.	U qed jaħdem.
I wasn’t sure about any of this	Ma kontx ċert dwar xi ħaġa minn dan
I’ve been thinking about this for a while	Ħsibt dwar dan għal xi żmien
I try not to.	Nipprova ma.
I want to do things	Irrid nagħmel l-affarijiet
I'm not going back to school	Jien mhux se mmur lura l-iskola
He knew that.	Kien jaf li.
I'm not saying anything	Jien ma ngħid xejn
I haven't eaten in a long time	Ilni ma tiekol
That's too long.	Dak huwa twil wisq.
I didn’t think he was going to do that	Ma kontx naħseb li kien se jagħmel dan
It's not hard to do.	Mhuwiex diffiċli li tagħmel.
I was making money.	Kont qed nagħmel flus.
I can't even imagine why this is happening	Lanqas nista’ nifhem għaliex qed jiġri dan
It seemed so easy.	Deher daqshekk faċli.
Sure, he would have.	Żgur, kien ikollu.
He knew what was going to happen now.	Kien jaf x’għandu jiġri issa.
I know it will be difficult	Naf li se jkun diffiċli
I was late back	Kont tard lura
And he's not here.	U hu mhux hawn.
That was some years ago.	Dan kien xi snin ilu.
He never knew who he was.	Hu qatt ma kien jaf min hu.
This may help, it may not.	Dan jista 'jgħin, jista' le.
Like doing everything else.	Bħal tagħmel kull ħaġa oħra.
What has been done is done.	Dak li sar isir.
I think we should just be friends	Naħseb li għandna nkunu ħbieb biss
I will definitely go there again.	Żgur li nerġa' mmur hemm.
She is not there.	Hija mhix hemm.
I did not die.	I ma miet.
I knew it would be early	Kont naf li se tkun kmieni
But that’s not what happened.	Imma dan mhux dak li ġara.
I hadn’t really thought about that	Ma kontx verament ħsibt dwar dan
And it will happen.	U se jiġri.
That, we knew.	Dak, konna nafu.
It must have started.	Irid ikun beda.
It was never going to happen.	Qatt ma kien se jiġri.
But we were more than ever.	Imma konna aktar minn qatt qabel.
I wanted to hear everything he had to say	Ridt nisma’ dak kollu li kellu xi jgħid
I will be in the back.	Jien se nkun fuq wara.
He will not come back.	Mhux se jiġi lura.
Maybe you were planning that.	Forsi kont qed tippjana li.
This is not working.	Dan mhux qed jaħdem.
But not everything.	Imma mhux kollox.
No more, tonight.	Mhux aktar, illejla.
He never asked about it.	Hu qatt ma staqsa dwarha.
We need to do more.	Irridu nagħmlu aktar.
If there was a time.	Kieku kien hemm żmien.
I didn't want anything	Ma ridt xejn
I didn’t think he was going to do it.	Ma kontx naħseb li kien se jagħmel.
To do this to such a beautiful person.	Li tagħmel dan lil persuna tant sabiħa.
I already knew where he lived	Diġà kont naf fejn jgħix
So he did.	Hekk għamel dan.
Not everyone can or should be one.	Mhux kulħadd jista’ jew għandu jkun xi ħaġa waħda.
I listen to this all the time	Nisma dan il-ħin kollu
I needed something	Kelli bżonn xi ħaġa
I was hoping it would	Kont qed nittama li kieku
It was nothing like that	Ma kien xejn bħal dan
My first one ever.	L-ewwel wieħed tiegħi qatt.
Maybe he was right.	Forsi kellu raġun.
It's time.	Wasal iż-żmien.
It seemed like a very long time had passed	Deher li għadda żmien twil ħafna
Or it won't.	Jew mhux se.
That was all anyone knew.	Dan kien kull ma kien jaf xi ħadd.
Now he had done that.	Issa kien għamel dan.
I will be back in time	Se nkun lura fi żmien
It was nothing.	Ma kien xejn.
I wonder if anyone can really	Nistaqsi jekk xi ħadd verament jista’
I am none of these things	Jiena xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet
Which is a good thing.	Li hija ħaġa tajba.
for that.	għal dak.
I thought I knew who had this	Ħsibt li tkun taf min kellu dan
They were like that.	Kienu hekk.
This is hard to do.	Dan huwa diffiċli li tagħmel.
I'm not sure about that	M'inix ċert dwar dan
I hadn’t even heard it coming	Lanqas kont smajt ġej
You could be anyone.	Inti tista 'tkun xi ħadd.
I can’t believe you knew all this time	Ma nistax nemmen li kont taf dan iż-żmien kollu
This was over and over and over.	Dan kien aktar u aktar u aktar.
I was ready for more.	Kont lest għal aktar.
I will have to do this for myself	Ikolli nagħmel dan għalija
You've done the same.	Inti stajt għamilt l-istess.
She was great to me, and great to me.	Hija kienet kbira għalija, u kbira għalija.
Either that or we are doing something really wrong.	Jew hekk jew qed nagħmlu xi ħaġa tassew ħażina.
He was not saying no.	Ma kienx jgħid le.
I hope this was helpful !.	Nittama li dan kien ta' għajnuna!.
I was going to tell you to go to school.	Kont se ngħidlek li għandek tmur l-iskola.
I never thought I would ask	Qatt ma ħsibt li nistaqsi
I want to be a good person	Irrid inkun persuna tajba
But it doesn’t really work that way.	Imma mhux hekk jaħdem fil-fatt.
A boy who once was his	Tifel li darba kien tiegħu
I don’t know why anyone would be otherwise.	Ma nafx għalfejn xi ħadd ikun mod ieħor.
No one saw him coming last night.	Ħadd ma ra lbieraħ filgħaxija ġej.
I don’t know what it is.	Ma nafx x'inhu.
I always thought it would be	Dejjem ħsibt li jkun
Out here were just them.	Hawn barra kienu biss huma.
I think about everything.	Naħseb dwar kollox.
I really had no friends	Verament ma kellix ħbieb
I am trying to be a better person	Qed nipprova nkun persuna aħjar
He is afraid to appear.	Jibża’ li jidher.
I would like to know more about this	Nixtieq inkun naf aktar dwar dan
He hopes to be late for school.	Huwa jittama li jkun tard l-iskola.
And not for ours.	U mhux għal tagħna.
I can do my homework later	Nista' nagħmel id-dar tiegħi aktar tard
Better late than never.	Aħjar tard milli qatt.
But it was never enough.	Imma qatt ma kien biżżejjed.
I still can't believe it.	Għadni ma nistax nemmen.
This has definitely made things easier.	Dan żgur għamel l-affarijiet aktar faċli.
Much much more.	Ħafna ħafna aktar.
You can go back home.	Tista' tmur lura d-dar.
I think everyone did that too.	Naħseb li kulħadd għamel hekk ukoll.
Well, it wasn’t you.	Ukoll, ma kontx int.
We know nothing about it.	Ma nafu xejn dwarha.
I’m not saying we should know	Mhux qed ngħid li għandna nkunu nafu
I don’t know why you did so much about it.	Ma nafx għaliex inti għamilt daqshekk kbir dwar dan.
There wasn’t much he could do here.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna li seta' jagħmel hawn.
I wanted to at that time	Ridt dak iż-żmien
Definitely they are.	Żgur li huma.
He was not going to be the one to do it.	Hu ma kienx se jkun hu li jagħmel dan.
I couldn’t say one way or the other	Ma stajtx ngħid mod jew ieħor
Do this with me more.	Tagħmel dan miegħi aktar.
Not the same time.	Mhux l-istess ħin.
I never saw it coming	Qatt ma rajt li ġej
I have never done so before.	Qatt ma għamilt hekk qabel.
It will not do that.	Mhux se tagħmel dan.
It seems around.	Jidher madwar.
I suspect this is what happened	Nissuspetta li dan huwa dak li ġara
I need to talk to you very, very badly	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek ħafna, ħażin ħafna
I’ll see more tonight.	Ser nara aktar illejla.
I wish she was mine	Nixtieq hi tkun tiegħi
I really want this to work	Irrid ħafna li dan jaħdem
I want to say so	Irrid li tgħid hekk
I think he lives there	Naħseb li jgħix hemm
If you're good to go.	Jekk int tajjeb biex tmur.
I don't have to.	M'għandix għalfejn.
I don't want any more.	Ma rridx aktar.
No one looked.	Ħadd ma ħares.
He didn't do it often.	Ma kienx jagħmel dan ta’ spiss.
It's hard to say.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid.
He probably wouldn’t get home.	Probabbilment ma kienx se jasal id-dar.
I think now is a good time	Naħseb li issa huwa żmien tajjeb
I know it's not that easy	Naf li mhux daqshekk faċli
I thought so too.	Jien kont ħsibt hekk ukoll.
It's going well.	Huwa sejjer tajjeb.
How long has that been.	Kemm kien ilu dak.
A little more than that	Ftit minn hekk
It looked pretty bad.	Deher pjuttost ħażin.
I know something wrong	Naf xi ħaġa ħażina
I didn't think anything could	Ma ħsibt li xejn jista’
That can't be right!	Dan ma jistax ikun tajjeb!.
I didn’t know I was here	Ma kontx naf li kont hawn
Everyone took a long time.	Kulħadd ħa ħafna ħin.
I just had to try all that stuff	Kelli biss nipprova dak l-affarijiet kollha
Maybe this can work.	Forsi dan jista 'jaħdem.
I do nothing.	Jien ma nagħmel xejn.
I suspect he had been doing this for a long time	Nissuspetta li kien ilu jagħmel dan
If he is good to you, we can.	Jekk huwa tajjeb miegħek, nistgħu.
It was.	Kien.
I can’t do more alone	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar waħdi
A little busy here.	Ftit okkupat hawn.
I never expected that	Qatt ma kont nistenna
I know what you will say.	Naf x'se tgħid.
Like before.	Bħal dak ta’ qabel.
He was not.	Hu ma kienx.
But only one problem.	Imma problema waħda biss.
He would say whatever he wants to anyone.	Kien jgħid dak kollu li jrid lil xi ħadd.
He never really is.	Qatt ma hu verament.
It was better.	Kien aħjar.
Well, that's a problem.	Ukoll, dik hija problema.
That we need help.	Li għandna bżonn l-għajnuna.
I know he would never leave	Naf li qatt ma kien se jitlaq
And anything else you need or need.	U kull ħaġa oħra li għandek bżonn jew li għandhom bżonn.
I heard it went very well	Smajt li mar tajjeb ħafna
There wasn’t much money around, really.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna flus madwar, il-verità.
It's just.	Huwa biss.
I think it’s great	Naħseb li hi kbira
Definitely not a good thing.	Żgur li mhix xi ħaġa tajba.
I'm not ready for that.	Jien mhux lest għal dan.
He didn’t want to talk about it either.	Ma riedx jitkellem dwarha lanqas.
I’ve been doing this forever.	Jien kont qed nagħmel dan għal dejjem.
He was coming back.	Kien jiġi lura.
He was not surprised by this.	Huwa ma kienx sorpriż b'dan.
Really bad, actually.	Tassew ħażin, fil-fatt.
I want to know where they are	Irrid inkun naf fejn huma
I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you	Jien ma kontx hawn kieku ma kienx għalik
It’s either this or that, he says.	Huwa jew dan jew dan, jgħid.
I just want to see it come and go tomorrow	Irrid biss nara għada tiġi u tmur
Now she knew.	Issa kienet taf.
I just thought about something, and it happened	Ħsibt biss dwar xi ħaġa, u ġara
I still have them all, of course.	Għadni kollha, ovvjament.
He didn’t know where or how to do it.	Ma kienx jaf fejn jew kif jagħmel dan.
I just wanted to.	Ridt biss.
I just had to try.	Kelli biss nipprova.
One has to leave.	Wieħed għandu jitlaq.
Long time no see.	Żmien twil.
I probably, too.	I probabbilment, wisq.
I know that already.	Naf li diġà.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
I needed to be there for him	Kelli bżonn inkun hemm għalih
That is what it is.	Dan huwa dak li hu.
Not my first.	Mhux l-ewwel tiegħi.
I have to tell everyone.	Jien għandi ngħid lil kulħadd.
He did it, and that is enough.	Huwa għamel dan, u dan huwa biżżejjed.
Come here.	Ejja hawn.
Maybe it happens, maybe not.	Forsi jiġri, forsi le.
She didn't.	Hija ma.
I have been doing this for a very long time	Għamilt hekk għal żmien twil ħafna
You can do that.	Tista 'tagħmel dan.
I wasn't talking to anyone	Jien ma kont qed nitkellem ma’ ħadd
I know that, for sure.	Naf li, żgur.
Me, not so much.	Jien, mhux daqshekk.
I can't do it tonight	Ma nistax nagħmel illejla issa
That was good for me.	Dak kien tajjeb miegħi.
I was scared	Jien kont nibża’
You were supposed to come here first.	Int suppost ġejt hawn l-ewwel.
I have already said too much	Diġà għedt wisq
It’s not easy being me.	Mhux faċli li tkun jien.
The first one looks beautiful.	L-ewwel waħda tidher sabiħa.
I knew what was going on.	Kont naf x’qed jiġri.
Here it is.	Hawn hu.
But please don’t.	Imma jekk jogħġbok ma tagħmilx.
But now it's very easy.	Imma issa huwa faċli ħafna.
This obviously doesn’t look good.	Dan ovvjament ma jidhirx tajjeb.
This can be both good and bad.	Din tista’ tkun kemm ħaġa tajba kif ukoll ħażina.
I didn’t think it was just me	Ma kontx naħseb li kien biss
I was sure of it	Jien kont ċert dwar dan
But they were his.	Imma kienu tiegħu.
I do this all the time.	Nagħmel dan il-ħin kollu.
Not even his friend who was with him.	Lanqas ħabib tiegħu li kien miegħu.
Shouldn't ?.	M'għandux?.
I should be able to understand all things by now	Għandi nkun kapaċi nifhem l-affarijiet kollha sa issa
I have to think about that	Ikolli naħseb fuq dan
There must be a better way.	Għandu jkun hemm mod aħjar.
Now, of course, everyone seems to have one.	Issa, ovvjament, kulħadd jidher li għandu wieħed.
I just can't do anything about it	I biss ma nista 'nagħmel xejn dwar dan
That must be enough.	Dan irid ikun biżżejjed.
He really didn’t want to talk about it now.	Huwa verament ma riedx jitkellem dwar dan issa.
I like to think he is	Inħobb naħseb li hu
It's good.	Huwa tajjeb.
We are not one.	Aħna mhux wieħed.
We hardly know how many.	Ma tantx nafu kemm.
It was busy.	Kien okkupat.
Not very long.	Mhux twil ħafna.
Come to my room.	Ejja fil-kamra tiegħi.
It was someone else all the time.	Kien xi ħadd ieħor il-ħin kollu.
There is more to it than that.	Hemm aktar minn dan.
It's pretty good.	Huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
I was never here before you saw me	Qatt ma kont hawn qabel ma tara
There was someone else out there, someone behind it all.	Kien hemm xi ħadd ieħor hemmhekk, xi ħadd wara dan kollu.
And all right.	U kollox tajjeb.
I shouldn’t be out here with him	M'għandix inkun hawn barra miegħu
I never went.	Qatt ma kont immur.
He has nothing else.	M’għandux xi ħaġa oħra.
Like other people.	Bħal nies oħra.
And it was working.	U kien qed jaħdem.
I would be glad.	Inkun ferħan.
You know.	Taf fi.
I didn’t want to know the truth.	Jien ma ridtx inkun naf il-verità.
I can’t wait to eat something else	Ma nistax nistenna li niekol xi ħaġa oħra
I was expecting a bit	Kont qed nistenna ftit
I came to see how it was going.	Ġejt biex nara kif kien sejjer.
It may not be you.	Jista 'ma jkunx int.
This may take a while.	Dan jista' jieħu ftit.
There is another problem with this.	Hemm problema oħra ma 'dan.
I didn’t hear much	Jien ma tantx smajt
Now I want to do that.	Issa nixtieq nagħmel hekk.
I like to do things for him.	Inħobb nagħmel affarijiet għalih.
I have a problem here	Għandi problema hawn
I love what I did with that	Inħobb dak li għamilt ma' dik
I can say that for sure.	Jien nista' ngħid li għal ċert.
I didn’t tell anyone	Jien ma għedt lil ħadd
I was wondering if anyone here could help	Kont qed nistaqsi jekk xi ħadd hawn jistax jgħin
I’ve been able to do something.	Jien stajt nagħmel xi ħaġa.
That’s what he was doing.	Dak hu li kien jagħmel.
I’m surprised he’s telling someone	Jien sorpriż li qed jgħid lil xi ħadd
Now I’ve been able to see a lot better	Issa stajt nara ħafna aħjar
We need your help.	Għandna bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
Quite something for everyone.	Pjuttost xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
But this is nothing.	Imma dan mhu xejn.
That was a good thing.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
Here they are !.	Hawn huma!.
He is our friend.	Huwa ħabib tagħna.
It was never there.	Qatt ma kien hemm.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
I don't know what you're thinking.	Ma nafx x’qed taħseb.
I'm definitely not a morning person	Żgur li m’iniex persuna ta’ filgħodu
Nothing seems to be working for this.	Xejn jidher li qed jaħdem għal dan.
I wish she hadn't	Nixtieq li ma tkunx għamlet hekk
I wasn’t scared anymore.	Ma kontx nibża aktar.
It's a good idea.	Hija idea tajba.
But there was more.	Imma kien hemm aktar.
I never had a chance	Qatt ma kelli ċans
I wanted to be happy	Ridt inkun kuntent
I thought they were my friends	Ħsibt li kienu ħbieb tiegħi
I was pretty sure you were	Kont pjuttost ċert li inti
But something more.	Imma xi ħaġa aktar.
For us, it was now or never.	Għalina, kien issa jew qatt.
He was a man of a man.	Kien raġel ta’ raġel.
I’ve never been better either	Jien qatt ma kont aħjar ukoll
You don't have to think anymore.	M'għandekx għalfejn taħseb aktar.
I hadn’t seen any of this before	Jien ma kont rajt xejn minn dan qabel
I need to say something	Għandi bżonn li tgħid xi ħaġa
I was just ahead of time.	Kont ftit qabel iż-żmien.
I will do more than that.	Jien se nagħmel aktar minn hekk.
I think he said so.	Naħseb li qal hekk.
I didn't know what to say.	Ma kontx naf x’se ngħid.
I didn’t have to.	Ma kellix għalfejn.
This is better.	Dan huwa aħjar.
I just want to wait	Nixtieq biss noqgħod nistenna
That was when we first did it.	Dak kien meta għamilna l-ewwel darba.
I would like that.	Nixtieq hekk.
Now it's ours.	Issa huwa tagħna.
Rather.	Pjuttost.
You can do anything.	Tista' tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I thought this would look better	Ħsibt li dan jidher aħjar
It would only help if you were here.	Ikun biss jgħin kieku inti hawn.
That’s what I wanted.	Dak hu li ridt.
I was with him.	Kont miegħu.
Pretty quick to do as well.	Pjuttost malajr biex tagħmel ukoll.
I didn’t want to think too much about it	Ma ridtx naħseb wisq fuq dan
I knew this time was coming	Kont naf li dan iż-żmien kien se jasal
I need to do this first	L-ewwel għandi bżonn nagħmel dan
But it was.	Imma kienet.
There was no other time.	Ma kienx hemm ħin mod ieħor.
I had no idea what he was going to say	Ma kellix idea x'kien se tgħid
He is what he is.	Hu dak li hu.
I hope it works	Jien nittama li jaħdem
I know how things were before	Naf kif kienu l-affarijiet qabel
Not very good.	Mhux tajjeb ħafna.
He does and he has to.	Jagħmel u għandu.
She is not a person.	Hija mhix persuna.
It’s such a beautiful thing.	Hija ħaġa tant sabiħa.
Expectable.	Ta’ min jistenna.
There was just something about it.	Kien hemm biss xi ħaġa dwarha.
How to do it ?.	Kif tagħmel dan?.
I'm not a morning person	Jien mhux persuna ta’ filgħodu
That was it.	Dak x'kien.
In fact, she can't, or says she can't.	Fil-fatt, hi ma tistax, jew tgħid li ma tistax.
I had no intention of doing anything like that	Ma kont ħsibt xejn biex nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik
I doubt it very much	Jiena niddubita ħafna
I'm not going to tell you	Jien mhux se ngħidlek
I had to do something.	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa.
I only saw one person, a man	Rajt persuna waħda biss, raġel
Worried that something was wrong.	Inkwetat li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
It was years ago.	Kien snin ilu.
They felt much later.	Ħassu ħafna aktar tard.
I couldn't believe it was me	Ma stajtx nemmen li kont jien
She just had to go. 	Kellha biss tmur. 
it was really, really good.	kien tassew, tassew tajjeb.
But now you speak.	Imma issa titkellem.
I don’t think it’s coming.	Ma naħsibx li ġej.
It's been a long time coming.	Ilu żmien twil ġej.
A way to make things better.	Mod kif tagħmel l-affarijiet aħjar.
In fact you can’t do that.	Fil-fatt ma tistax tagħmel dan.
I thought it would be me.	Ħsibt li se nkun jien.
No, this week was too early.	Le, din il-ġimgħa kienet kmieni wisq.
I think not too bad	Naħseb li mhux ħażin wisq
I know you are planning	Naf li qed jippjana
It was not there.	Ma kienx hemm.
I came here.	Ġejt hawn.
She will go here and there.	Hija se tmur hawn u hemm.
It seems to do.	Jidher li jagħmel.
I know what you're doing	Naf x'qed tagħmel
There was a lot he wanted to say.	Kien hemm ħafna li ried jgħid.
You really did well.	Int verament għamilt tajjeb.
Not much more is good.	Mhux wisq aktar hu tajjeb.
You have enough time.	Għandek ħin biżżejjed.
It is.	Huwa.
And not just work.	U mhux biss ix-xogħol.
You should do this as often as possible.	Għandek tagħmel dan kemm jista 'jkun spiss.
And you want something.	U trid xi ħaġa.
It's just bad.	Huwa ħażin biss.
And so I did.	U hekk għamilt.
I think we will go back to that.	Naħseb li se mmorru lura għal dak.
But that’s not what happens.	Imma dan mhux dak li jiġri.
I will be here tomorrow	Jien se nkun hawn għada
It works like before now.	Jaħdem bħal qabel issa.
That was great.	Dan kien tajjeb ħafna.
I hope there is a better way to do this	Nispera li jkun hemm mod aħjar kif isir dan
I know something is wrong	Naf li xi ħaġa ħażina hi ħażina
I really enjoy talking to you	Inħobb ħafna nitkellem miegħek
It's much more done.	Huwa ħafna aktar isir.
But it really wasn’t like that.	Imma verament ma kienx hekk.
Well, maybe it was now.	Ukoll, forsi kien issa.
I need help from everyone	Ikolli bżonn l-għajnuna minn kulħadd
But that was not enough for me.	Imma dan ma kienx biżżejjed għalija.
And much more.	U ħafna aktar.
Really worth playing.	Tassew ta’ min jilgħab.
I think it will be beautiful	Naħseb li se tkun sabiħa
I knew it was going to happen, but	Kont naf li se jiġri, imma
There was a man behind that door.	Kien hemm raġel wara dak il-bieb.
This is just how it works.	Dan huwa biss kif jaħdem.
I will not do it again.	Mhux se nerġa' nagħmel.
I can be here for three years.	Jien nista' nkun hawn għal tliet snin.
I'm unemployed.	Jien bla xogħol.
I am very sorry for what has just happened	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal dak li għadu kif ġara
He was not the only one.	Ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
And after that.	U wara dak.
Not sure why either.	Mhux ċert għaliex lanqas.
I can't talk about it	Ma nistax nitkellem dwarha
We know.	Li nafu.
It was all wrong.	Kien kollu ħażin.
There was no problem.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda problema.
I couldn't understand what he was doing	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien qed jagħmel
Everything will work.	Kollox se jaħdem.
But there is nothing.	Imma m'hemm xejn.
I like a lot of things	Nixtieq ħafna affarijiet
He had seen enough.	Huwa kien ra biżżejjed.
That was good enough to know that.	Dan kien tajjeb biżżejjed biex tkun taf dan.
No money.	L-ebda flus.
And that was really enough.	U dan kien verament biżżejjed.
I just don't believe it.	I biss ma nemmen.
And he had.	U kellu.
That you.	Li int.
I can't go again.	Ma nistax immur mill-ġdid.
So he is with us now.	Hekk hu issa magħna.
I never wanted any of that	Qatt ma ridt xejn minn hekk
It was more than enough.	Kien aktar minn biżżejjed.
There was no easy way to do it.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda mod faċli biex tagħmel dan.
Obviously, this can take some time.	Ovvjament, dan jista 'jieħu ftit żmien.
I don't know why.	Ma nafx għaliex.
This may work.	Dan jista 'jaħdem.
I can do that.	Jien nista' nagħmel dan.
He seemed to want to do it.	Deher li ried jagħmel dan.
I see how he sees	Nara kif jara
You have to go back.	Għandek tmur lura.
He didn’t know you were here.	Ma kienx jaf li inti qiegħed hawn.
About this.	Dwar dan.
I wish there was another way	Nixtieq li jkun hemm mod ieħor
You are not with me.	M'intix miegħi.
Why? 	Għaliex?
I'm happy about that	Jien kuntent dwar dan
I am speaking for myself	Qed nitkellem għalija waħdi
I never do that	Jien qatt ma nagħmel hekk
He was never here.	Qatt ma kien hawn.
It was so fast.	Kien daqshekk malajr.
He hadn’t told me about it.	Ma kienx qalli dwarha.
It hadn’t been that long.	Ma kienx ilu daqshekk.
I wait for another time	Nistenna għal ftit ħin ieħor
I think he just wanted to talk	Naħseb li ried jitkellem biss
I don’t know if this is right or wrong.	Ma nafx jekk dan hux tajjeb jew ħażin.
I want someone else to do it.	Irrid li xi ħadd ieħor jagħmel dan.
I didn’t know it was coming.	Ma kontx naf li kien ġej.
I knew she was there	Kont naf li kienet hemmhekk
It can be difficult.	Jista 'jkun diffiċli.
I was right.	Jien kont raġun.
I'm just too scared.	Biss nibża’ wisq.
I’m good at this.	Jien tajjeb dwar dan.
I was young but I knew what had happened	Kont żgħir imma kont naf x’ġara
Obviously they do.	Ovvjament jagħmlu.
You can’t even do that.	Ma tistax lanqas tagħmel dan.
About the time too, he would say.	Dwar iż-żmien ukoll, kien jgħid.
I want to know about tonight	Irrid inkun naf dwar illejla
I have a few problems here.	Għandi ftit problemi hawn.
It seems like everything is there.	Jidher li kollox hemm.
I couldn’t tell if she was still there	Ma stajtx ngħid jekk kinitx għadha hemm
Other people are just someone we know.	Nies oħra huma biss xi ħadd li nafu.
Had it been him, it would have been the last time he appeared.	Kieku kien hu, kienet l-aħħar darba li deher.
But I didn’t say anything.	Imma ma għidt xejn.
I need help with this one.	Għandi bżonn għajnuna ma 'dan wieħed.
Here's how.	Hawn kif.
It hardly does.	Ma tantx tagħmel.
I'm sure you really know this.	Jien ċert li int verament taf dan.
It needs to be, really.	Jeħtieġ li jkun, tassew.
I should never be the same again	Qatt m'għandi nkun l-istess mill-ġdid
Try something first.	Ipprova xi ħaġa l-ewwel.
I had to know all the time	I kellha tkun taf il-ħin kollu
I will not do this again	Jien mhux se nerġa' nagħmel dan
Well, we have time.	Ukoll, għandna ħin.
That's so great.	Dak hekk kbir.
This can happen to just one person, too.	Dan jista 'jiġri ma' persuna waħda biss, ukoll.
I wanted to see what they were doing	Ridt nara x’qed jagħmlu
It was something more.	Kienet xi ħaġa aktar.
Most people have	Ħafna nies għandhom
I hope you can see that	Nispera li tista' tara dan
It never was, it never will be.	Qatt ma kien, qatt ma se jkun.
Hard is hard.	Diffiċli huwa diffiċli.
I am after all	Jiena wara kollox
I will speak for him	Jien se nitkellem għalih
I did nothing wrong	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin
I'm sure of it	Jien ċert minn dan
Everyone becomes happy.	Kulħadd isir kuntent.
I was glad I was there	Kont kuntent li kont hemm
Not once.	Lanqas darba.
No one else is there.	Ħadd ieħor ma hemm.
I speak again.	nerġa nitkellem.
You never know where you are.	Qatt ma tkun taf fejn int.
I didn’t know where we were	Ma kontx naf fejn konna
The first year.	L-ewwel sena.
Usually, this works.	Normalment, dan jaħdem.
I knew it would be.	Kont naf li se jkun.
I can’t believe she was doing that to me.	Ma nistax nemmen li kienet tagħmel hekk miegħi.
She wasn't there.	Ma kinitx hi.
I wish we had more time	Nixtieq li kellna aktar ħin
I had to go outside	Kelli mmur noqgħod barra
He is a good man.	Huwa raġel tajjeb.
It takes as long as it takes.	Huwa jieħu kemm jieħu.
I’m better than all of these	Jien aħjar minn dawn kollha
I'm here now.	Jien hawn issa.
I had the exact same problem.	Kelli l-istess problema eżatt.
If it were easy, everyone would do it.	Kieku kien faċli, kulħadd jagħmel dan.
It goes back and forth the same.	Jmur lura u lura l-istess.
I knew they were.	Kont naf li kienu.
I just know how they are	Naf biss kif huma
And let me tell you something.	U ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
I have what you might want	Għandi dak li forsi trid
In fact I still am.	Fil-fatt għadni.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
Or maybe it wasn’t.	Jew forsi ma kienx.
I knew better than that	Kont naf aħjar minn hekk
I'm really trying to understand	Verament qed nipprova nifhem
But no one said anything.	Imma ħadd ma qal xejn.
That was something else.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
And he wouldn’t have, either.	U ma kienx ikollu, lanqas.
You are telling the truth.	Qed tgħid il-verità.
I wasn’t ready to do that before	Ma kontx lest biex nagħmlu dan qabel
It wasn’t something he loved to do too often.	Ma kinitx xi ħaġa li kien iħobb jagħmel spiss wisq.
He had come home.	Kien wasal id-dar.
You don’t have to do that.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel dan.
I had a great time	Kelli żmien tajjeb ħafna
I wanted to be out	Ridt inkun barra
I was alone.	Jien kont waħdi.
Don’t go without telling me where he is.	M'għandekx tmur mingħajr ma tgħidli fejn hu.
There is no such person.	M'hemm l-ebda persuna bħal din.
Everything came together	Kollox ġie flimkien
No one does it alone.	Ħadd ma jagħmel dan waħdu.
You will.	Int ser tagħmel.
I really thought he was a beautiful person	Verament ħsibt li kien persuna sabiħa
And fast.	U malajr.
I’m there to do something.	Jien hemmhekk nagħmel xi ħaġa.
I didn’t want to know this	Ma ridtx inkun naf dan
I will have to be with you	Ikolli nkun miegħek
I can't understand the problem.	Ma nistax nifhem il-problema.
Certainly not.	Żgur li ma kienx.
Later this week, if it’s okay.	Aktar tard din il-ġimgħa, jekk hux tajjeb.
Just back.	Eżatt lura.
You are tired but everyone you know is tired.	Int għajjien imma kull min taf hu għajjien.
But he wanted out.	Imma ried barra.
But, of course, by then it would be too late.	Imma, ovvjament, sa dak iż-żmien ikun tard wisq.
And you know what you know.	U taf dak li taf.
He had not taken another.	Ma kienx ħa ieħor.
But not me.	Imma mhux jien.
Definitely what is happening now.	Żgur li huwa dak li qed jiġri issa.
I wanted to know how they felt	Ridt inkun naf kif ħassu
We have to go.	Irridu mmorru.
Nothing was a problem.	Xejn ma kien problema.
I have enough time to listen	Għandi ħin biżżejjed biex nisma
I didn't want to see it	Ma ridtx nara
As it always has been, probably.	Hekk kif dejjem kien, probabbilment.
Or once it was, obviously a lot.	Jew darba kien, ovvjament ħafna.
I never saw it.	Qatt ma rajt.
Neither did I.	Lanqas kont.
This is really happening.	Dan qed jiġri tassew.
And so it all began.	U hekk beda kollox.
It may not be.	Jista 'ma jkunx.
Sooner or later, it would.	Illum jew għada, kieku.
I didn’t want to know any more	Ma ridtx inkun naf aktar
I'm sorry for you	Jiddispjaċini għalik
To me this is a bad thing.	Għalija dan huwa ħażin ħażin.
We always are.	Aħna dejjem.
I have to go	Ikolli nkun sejjer
Nobody knows what's going on.	Ħadd ma jaf x’inhu jiġri.
I need to talk to you	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek
But he can't do that.	Imma ma jistax jagħmel dan.
It was coming around.	Kien ġej madwar.
It seems to be going on forever.	Jidher li sejjer għal dejjem.
It's too hard.	Huwa wisq diffiċli.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
I don't have to say why	M'għandix għalfejn ngħid għaliex
What to expect, he did not know.	X'għandu jistenna, ma kienx jaf.
I was hoping you had	Kont nittama li kellek
I didn't even know what had just happened	Lanqas kont naf x’kien għadu kif ġara
I have no idea what it will be.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'se jkun.
And there we have it.	U hemm għandna.
I have much more to say	Għandi ħafna aktar xi ngħid
I can only eat.	Jien nista' niekol biss.
He knew what to do.	Kien jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
Maybe it will be sooner.	Forsi se jkun qabel.
I didn’t want to know	Ma ridtx li jkun jaf
I am still tired today.	Għadni għajjien illum.
I just want to see where he lives.	Irrid nara biss fejn jgħix.
I believe he will come to this	Nemmen li se jasal għal dan
It gets very bad.	Jiġi ħażin ħafna.
Lots of fun.	Ħafna gost.
I think after me, come on.	Naħseb wara lili, ejja.
I did so as well.	Jien għamilt hekk ukoll.
It was happening.	Kien qed jiġri.
It had to be that way.	Kellu jkun hekk.
That's too good.	Dak tajjeb wisq.
It can’t be morning.	Ma jistax ikun filgħodu.
Many were not there	Ħafna ma kienx hemm
I can't really talk now	Ma nistax verament nitkellem issa
This can be a problem.	Dan jista 'jkun problema.
If that’s what you have, that’s fine.	Jekk dan huwa dak li għandek, huwa tajjeb.
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
Only a man.	Raġel biss.
I will be more helpful here.	Jien se nkun aktar għajnuna hawn.
This is my first car.	Din hija l-ewwel karozza tiegħi.
I need to go home with someone	Għandi bżonn immur id-dar ma’ xi ħadd
It was good that you came.	Kien tajjeb li ġejt.
Really not much to say.	Tassew ma tantx xi ngħid.
If she doesn't see anything, she can go home.	Jekk ma jidher xejn, hi tista’ tmur id-dar.
You are a good person.	Int persuna tajba.
And one does not know how he got there.	U wieħed ma jafx kif wasal hemm.
I went there too.	Jien mort hemm ukoll.
There is no.	M'hemm l-ebda.
No one had ever done this before.	Ħadd qatt ma kien għamel dan qabel.
He was interested.	Kien interessat.
I can't tell you that	Ma nistax ngħidlek hekk
I was talking.	Kont qed nitkellem.
I didn't see anything	Jien ma rajt xejn
You never do.	Inti qatt ma tagħmel.
But it wasn’t going to happen.	Imma ma kienx se jiġri.
I thought he had for a while	Ħsibt li kellu għal xi żmien
Not three years later	Le tliet snin wara
I did it.	Għamilt dan.
I never listen to anyone	Jien qatt ma nisma lil ħadd
I thought it was going well.	Ħsibt li kien sejjer tajjeb.
I don’t have to, you see.	M'għandix, tara.
She was.	Hija kienet.
That was really it.	Dak kien tassew.
I knew she was with us	Kont naf li kienet magħna
I'm very, very sorry	Jiddispjaċini ħafna, ħafna
Everything happened so fast.	Kollox ġara daqshekk malajr.
Everyone has.	Kulħadd għandu.
We want to be here.	Irridu nkunu hawn.
A man can be too big.	Raġel jista’ jkun kbir wisq.
I didn't hear anything	Jien ma smajt xejn
I want to tell you what really happened	Irrid ngħidlek x’ġara tassew
He wasn’t having to.	Ma kienx qed ikollu.
I was thinking a lot about it.	Jien kont qed naħseb ħafna dwar dan.
I couldn’t stand it and I didn’t do anything	Ma stajtx toqgħod u ma nagħmel xejn
We have the whole house to ourselves.	Għandna d-dar kollha għalina.
There is no other way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor.
I didn’t know I was here	Ma kontx naf li kont hawn
But she was a man.	Imma kienet raġel.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.	Imma m'għandux ikun hekk.
He doesn’t want or need anything.	Hu ma jrid jew jeħtieġ xejn.
Well, not right after.	Ukoll, mhux eżatt wara.
Like I said, you can't tell anyone.	Kif għedt, ma tista’ tgħid lil ħadd.
Tonight I may be very late	Illejla forsi nkun tard ħafna
It can’t be that hard.	Ma jistax ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
You have to think so.	Trid taħseb hekk.
It was probably too late, though.	Probabbilment kien tard wisq, imma .
I think he saw more than he ever said	Naħseb li ra aktar milli qatt qal
She was right.	Kellha raġun.
I knew what was coming next	Kont naf dak li ġej wara
I knew how tired you must be	Kont naf kemm trid tkun għajjien
I know everything you have to say	Naf dak kollu li għandek xi tgħid
I wonder if anyone can help	Nistaqsi jekk xi ħadd jistax jgħin
But where.	Imma fejn .
Sorry for that.	Jiddispjaċini għal dan.
She was talking about something big.	Kienet titkellem dwar xi ħaġa kbira.
I didn't even have to say anything	Lanqas ma kelli ngħid xejn
If, if, if.	Jekk, jekk, jekk.
Here he goes.	Hawn imur.
But that’s not enough, he said.	Imma dan mhux biżżejjed, qal.
I couldn't believe it	Ma stajtx nemmen
It was here.	Kien hawn.
I never did that.	Qatt ma għamilt hekk.
The truth is, it’s beautiful.	Il-verità hi, hi sabiħa.
I never thought about it	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan
He was not a bad man.	Ma kienx raġel ħażin.
Its doing very well for this.	Tiegħu jagħmel tajjeb ħafna għal dan.
Everything.	Kollox.
It can happen to anyone.	Jista’ jiġri lil kulħadd.
But he never did.	Imma qatt ma għamel.
I almost didn’t have time now	Kważi ma kellix ħin issa
I think it’s been a while.	Naħseb li ilu xi żmien.
This could have happened.	Dan seta’ ġara.
I thought it was getting better	Ħsibt li kien sejjer aħjar
I have something for you	Għandi xi ħaġa għalik
I wasn’t being a good friend	Jien ma kontx qed inkun ħabib tajjeb
And it does a good job.	U jagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
He can say that something is happening.	Jista’ jgħid li qed jiġri xi ħaġa.
Much more my thing.	Wisq aktar ħaġa tiegħi.
You have to go and do another.	Għandek tmur u tagħmel ieħor.
I still didn’t want to leave	Għadni ma ridtx jitlaq
But it is not something he can do for a living.	Imma mhux xi ħaġa li seta’ jagħmel għal xogħol.
I wanted to go home.	Ridt immur id-dar.
As it was.	Kif kien.
I can't understand how to do that.	Ma nistax nifhem kif nagħmel dan.
I thought it was someone	Ħsibt li kien xi ħadd
I'm worried about him	Jien inkwetat għalih
They do things and we can’t.	Huma jagħmlu affarijiet u aħna ma nistgħux.
I was worried he might be right	Kont inkwetat li jista’ jkollu raġun
About something.	Dwar xi ħaġa.
Not from here.	Mhux minn hawn.
I'm waiting outside your house	Qed nistenna barra d-dar tiegħek
There seems to be something here.	Jidher li jrid ikun hemm xi ħaġa hawn.
No one who went to our school lived there.	Ħadd li mar l-iskola tagħna ma kien jgħix hemmhekk.
It's still there.	Għadu hemm.
I thought it might work	Ħsibt li jista 'jaħdem
It was definitely not good enough for you.	Żgur li ma kinitx tajba biżżejjed għalik.
He had done what he had to do.	Huwa kien għamel dak li kellu.
I tell you everything.	Ngħidlek kollox.
I can’t just go back	Ma nistax immur lura biss
But certainly not.	Imma żgur li le.
It can happen and it will happen.	Jista’ jiġri u se jiġri.
Maybe the first time.	Forsi l-ewwel darba.
It will look like nothing ever happened.	Se jkun qisu qatt ma ġara xejn.
It is something more.	Hija xi ħaġa aktar.
I want what you have	Irrid dak li għandek
Say nothing more about it.	Tgħid xejn aktar dwarha.
It will probably be my last	Probabbilment se jkun l-aħħar tiegħi
I couldn’t go back to my room alone	Ma stajtx immur lura fil-kamra tiegħi waħdi
I understand everything now.	Nifhem kollox issa.
I can't go back to that house	Ma nistax immur lura lejn dik id-dar
Nothing ever happens.	Qatt ma jiġri xejn.
It would be good for him.	Ikun tajjeb għalih.
And it would be exactly where it needed to be.	U kienet tkun eżatt fejn kellha bżonn tkun.
It looks like it will be good.	Jidher li se jkun tajjeb.
I don’t understand anything about it.	Ma nifhem xejn dwarha.
She needed a job.	Hija kellha bżonn xogħol.
He was such a good man.	Kien raġel daqshekk tajjeb.
I really don't.	Jien verament ma.
But why go so far.	Imma għaliex tmur daqshekk.
Until then I was not tired	Sa dak iż-żmien ma kontx għajjien
Which is not.	Li mhux.
This never works.	Dan qatt ma jaħdem.
I was thinking that nothing could go wrong	Kont qed naħseb li xejn ma jista’ jmur ħażin
You may be surprised.	Inti tista 'tkun sorpriż.
It should look out.	Għandu jidher barra.
I do all this without thinking	Nagħmel dan kollu mingħajr ma naħseb
But no, it wasn’t.	Imma le, ma kienx.
And it can be.	U jista’ jkun hekk.
This is your south.	Din hija nofsinhar tiegħek.
I don't have an account	M'għandix kont
I can't tell you now	Ma nistax ngħidlek issa
As they do every year.	Kif jagħmlu kull sena.
Obviously, something is wrong.	Ovvjament, xi ħaġa hija ħażina.
I still want to be your friend	Għadni rrid inkun ħabib tiegħek
There is never enough money to come home.	Qatt ma hemm biżżejjed flus biex tiġi d-dar.
He could not have done otherwise.	Ma setax jagħmel mod ieħor.
So it was.	Hekk kien hekk.
I'm not ready.	Jien mhux lest.
I’m very surprised we did	Jien sorpriż ħafna li għamilna
She wasn’t going to talk about what was going on.	Ma kinitx se titkellem dwar dak li kien qed jiġri.
This is for me.	Dan huwa għalija.
I wanted everything to go well	Ridt li kollox imur tajjeb
Not where you are from.	Mhux minn fejn int.
Your car, someone said.	Il-karozza tiegħek, qal xi ħadd.
But that was many years ago.	Imma dan kien ħafna snin ilu.
I was not afraid of anything, of anything	Ma kont nibża’ minn xejn, minn xejn
You are really alone.	Int verament waħdek.
I thought it was pretty good.	Ħsibt li ġie pjuttost tajjeb.
I need you to stay here.	Għandi bżonn li toqgħod hawn.
I wonder if now is the time to ask	Nistaqsi jekk issa hux iż-żmien li nistaqsi
I don’t do that.	Jien ma nagħmel dan.
They always do a good job	Dejjem jagħmlu xogħol tajjeb
Not that anything happened.	Mhux li ġara xejn.
She had made some friends at work.	Hija kienet għamlet xi ħbieb fuq ix-xogħol.
Few people were.	Ftit nies kienu.
Be glad.	Ikun ferħan.
At home.	Fuq id-dar.
I couldn't do anything	Ma stajt nagħmel xejn
Surely they were there.	Żgur li kienu hemm.
I can say the same for you	Nista' ngħid l-istess għalik
All this.	Dan kollu.
I wanted to know what happened there	Ridt inkun naf x’ġara hemmhekk
So it actually happened.	Hekk ġara fil-fatt.
He never was.	Hu qatt ma kien.
I know just that, too.	Naf biss dik, ukoll.
As I said.	Kif għedt.
It was just there.	Kien hemm eżatt.
I would be very happy.	Inkun kuntent ħafna.
I was a boy.	Kont tifel.
I’m not thinking about it.	Mhux qed naħseb dwarha.
But that was nothing.	Imma dan ma kien xejn.
Maybe not, he thought.	Forsi mhix, ħaseb.
I was hoping for that	Kont nittama għal dan
That was what it was once.	Dan kien dak li kienet darba.
I will never tell anyone what happened tonight.	Qatt mhu se ngħid lil ħadd x’ġara hawn illejla.
I wish he was here too	Nixtieq li kien hawn ukoll
Not really doing anything.	Mhux verament tagħmel xejn.
I can do that.	I jista 'jagħmel dan.
I can say that he was worried too	Nista’ ngħid li hu kien inkwetat ukoll
Before he died.	Qabel miet.
A friend is right.	Ħabib għandu raġun.
It would be great if anyone could help.	Ikun kbir jekk xi ħadd jista 'jgħin.
I can do everything.	Kapaċi nagħmel kollox.
I just want to be sure	Irrid inkun ċert biss
It is, in fact, the same problem.	Hija, fil-fatt, l-istess problema.
You don’t want me to be here.	Ma tridx li nkun hawn.
I couldn’t believe what happened	Ma stajtx nemmen dak li ġara
I was pretty alone.	Kont pjuttost waħdi.
More and more the same.	Aktar u aktar l-istess.
But here and there, he does.	Imma hawn u hemm, hekk jagħmel.
It's so good.	Huwa hekk tajjeb.
I knew he would never get there	Kont naf li qatt ma kien se jasal hemm
But what can one do.	Imma dak li wieħed jista 'jagħmel.
We only know that this is what it is.	Nafu biss li dan huwa dak li hu.
Everything is pretty good.	Kollox tajjeb pjuttost tajjeb.
I have to understand this.	Ikolli nifhem dan.
I heard every problem she had	Smajt kull problema li kellha
And you can’t say that often.	U ma tistax tgħid hekk spiss.
To do this we need everyone.	Biex nagħmlu dan għandna bżonn lil kulħadd.
You did back.	Inti għamilt lura.
I think it was bad for him	Naħseb li kien ħażin għalih
I’ve been on one lately	Kont fuq waħda dan l-aħħar
You need to do this.	Għandek bżonn tagħmel dan.
It just makes you want more.	Jagħmel biss trid aktar.
Almost anything can and will happen to anyone.	Kważi xi ħaġa tista’ u se jiġri lil kulħadd.
I just wanted to talk to you before	Ridt biss nitkellem miegħek qabel
He will always be with us	Hu se jkun dejjem magħna
I have no idea where they are	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn huma
Not for you, but for me.	Mhux għalik, imma għalija.
I live here well enough	Jien noqgħod hawn tajjeb biżżejjed
I knew exactly what he was going to do	Kont naf eżatt x’kien se jagħmel
A man needs other things	Raġel għandu bżonn affarijiet oħra
I was glad he was happy	Kont kuntent li kien kuntent
But there is much more.	Imma hemm ħafna aktar.
I didn’t want to know, not really.	Ma ridtx inkun naf, mhux verament.
.	.
It never had to be.	Qatt ma kellu jkun.
You are not the first person to do this.	M'intix l-ewwel persuna li tagħmel dan.
I can’t think of a time when it wasn’t	Ma nistax naħseb fi żmien li ma kinitx
It was making it look good.	Kienet tagħmel tidher tajba.
I want to go home now	Irrid immur id-dar issa
I don’t think this was good.	Ma naħsibx li dan kien tajjeb.
It never was and never will be	Qatt ma kien u qatt mhu se jkun
Maybe he was dead.	Forsi kien miet.
Like, a lot more.	Bħal, ħafna aktar.
I can't understand.	Ma nistax nifhem.
It could be him.	Jista’ jkun li hu.
I wish this had never happened	Nixtieq li dan qatt ma ġara
It's time.	Wasal iż-żmien.
Maybe he knew what to expect.	Forsi kien jaf x’se jistenna.
I came back to tell you	Ġejt lura biex ngħidlek
I want to be the same	Irrid inkun l-istess
he said.	hu qal.
I think everyone should have something like this	Naħseb li kulħadd għandu jkollu xi ħaġa bħal din
I know how much you want this too	Naf kemm trid dan ukoll
More to come.	Aktar ġej.
I think it’s too early to go back to everything	Naħseb li għadu kmieni wisq biex lura għal kollox
It's pretty easy.	Huwa pjuttost faċli.
I hope it comes to everything	Jien nittama li jiġi għal kollox
Sure, that’s one way to do it.	Żgur, dak huwa mod wieħed kif tagħmel dan.
I didn’t want this to go away	Ma ridtx li dan jitlaq
It would not have happened otherwise.	Ma kienx jiġri mod ieħor.
I was not enough.	ma kontx biżżejjed.
I hope it won’t be the last time.	Nispera li ma tkunx l-aħħar darba.
I couldn't even speak	Jien lanqas stajt nitkellem
She you she after.	Hija inti hi wara.
Kelli le, le.	Kelli le, le.
I was scared of this	Jien kont nibża’ minn dan
Hi, hi, hi.	Hi, hi, hi.
I never do that	Qatt ma nagħmel hekk
I want them to do something about it	Nixtieq li jagħmlu xi ħaġa dwar dan
I would be back again	Inkun lura mill-ġdid
I thought it was there	Kont naħseb li kien hemm
Something.	Xi ħaġa.
He only wanted one thing.	Ried ħaġa waħda biss.
But no, you’re too good.	Imma le, int tajjeb wisq.
He thought one good one.	Huwa ħaseb tajjeb wieħed.
Say what you have to say.	Għid dak li għandek tgħid.
'fi'.	'fi'.
I think something could happen soon	Naħseb li jista' jiġri xi ħaġa dalwaqt
I see you are doing much better	Nara li inti sejjer ħafna aħjar
Well, that would be easy.	Ukoll, dan ikun faċli.
I’m glad I did	Jiena jien ferħan li għamilt
I've been with someone before	Jien kont ma’ xi ħadd qabel
I only have one and that is enough	Għandi wieħed biss u dan huwa biżżejjed
I thought.	Ħsibt.
He was trying to help.	Kien qed jipprova jgħin.
I didn’t look at anything else.	Jien ma ħares lejn xi ħaġa oħra.
I was too young for that	Kont żgħir wisq għal dan
And he loved to eat almost everything.	U kien iħobb jiekol kważi kollox.
It is.	Huwa.
They were nothing like this.	Ma kienu xejn bħal dan.
I just really want you	I biss verament irrid inti
But there are other things.	Imma hemm affarijiet oħra.
I didn’t want to think about it anymore	Ma ridtx naħseb aktar
I'm so glad you're back	Jien ferħan ħafna li int lura
No one knew where she was.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn kienet.
I was telling the truth	Kont qed ngħid il-verità
I just didn’t want to think about it	Biss ma ridtx naħseb dwarha
I don’t want anything more	Ma nixtieq xejn aktar
I was just worried about it	Kont biss inkwetat dwarha
This is it.	Dan hu.
I couldn’t do that again	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan mill-ġdid
I did so.	Għamilt hekk.
It's hard to go.	Huwa diffiċli li tmur.
That came later.	Dak ġie aktar tard.
What she did to me.	Dak li għamlet miegħi.
I would talk to him later	Kont nitkellem miegħu aktar tard
He was right.	Kellu raġun.
She was eating.	Kienet tiekol.
I was enjoying it, but maybe too much	Kont qed nieħu gost b’dan, imma forsi wisq
I think about home.	Naħseb dwar id-dar.
But we have a problem.	Imma għandna problema.
You know he is.	Taf li hu.
After what had happened.	Wara dak li kien ġara.
You want to do what you can.	Tixtieq tagħmel dak li tista'.
You will see a lot of this.	Int ser tara ħafna minn dan.
I will talk for hours	Se nitkellem għal sigħat
There you have to be.	Hemmhekk trid tkun.
Maybe a little.	Forsi ftit.
I couldn't go home.	Ma stajtx immur id-dar.
I never could.	Qatt ma stajt.
I have a better idea	Għandi idea aħjar
I have a problem with that.	Għandi problema b'dan.
It won’t work anymore.	Mhux se jaħdem aktar.
They are our friends.	Huma ħbieb tagħna.
The same thing happened as before.	L-istess ħaġa ġara bħal qabel.
And you should know better.	U għandek tkun taf aħjar.
You never know he was here.	Qatt ma tkun taf li kien hawn.
I was the first person to see it	Jien kont l-ewwel persuna li ra
You are not ready for this yet.	Għadek m'intix lest għal dan.
I knew it was there for me	Kont naf li kien hemm għalija
He couldn't be sure.	Ma setax ikun ċert.
I didn't always know that	Dan mhux dejjem kont naf
It seems wrong to be.	Jidher ħażin li jkun.
Whatever.	Tkun xi tkun.
But he couldn’t prove it.	Imma ma setax jipprova dan.
And it is.	U huwa.
I think you are right	Naħseb li għandek raġun
Everything is just.	Kollox huwa biss.
I'm not listening.	Jien mhux nisma.
I need to talk to you now	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek issa
As well as can.	Kif ukoll jista '.
Well, you can go.	Ukoll, tista 'tmur.
Come here.	Ġej hawn.
I can’t think about it now	Ma nistax naħseb dwar dan issa
That's not the case.	Dak mhux hekk.
They are us.	Huma aħna.
It's more.	Huwa aktar.
That may work.	Li jista 'jaħdem.
There was no one.	Ma kien hemm ħadd.
I wish it wasn’t.	Nixtieq li ma kienx.
I think that’s where we should go	Naħseb li hemm fejn għandna mmorru
I couldn’t help but be happy.	Ma stajtx ma nkun kuntent.
Now this is really bad.	Issa dan huwa tassew ħażin.
He had no one.	Ma kellu lil ħadd.
I was pretty wrong about that.	Jien kont ħażin ħażin dwar dan.
Okay, not quite, but almost.	Tajjeb, mhux pjuttost, imma kważi.
He had a lot to come up with, after all.	Kellu ħafna biex jasal għalih, wara kollox.
It was pretty good, actually.	Kien pjuttost tajjeb, fil-fatt.
She looked beautiful.	Hija ħares sabiħa.
Well, there could be one.	Ukoll, jista 'jkun hemm waħda.
Ask how it was.	Staqsa kif kien.
I was listening.	Jien kont nisma’.
I have heard for a long time.	Smajt għal żmien twil.
Few people do that.	Ftit nies jagħmlu dan.
He did it all on his own.	Huwa għamel dan kollu waħdu.
I can hardly speak	Jien kważi ma nistax nitkellem
We know that.	Aħna nafu li.
I know other people like that as well.	Naf nies oħra bħal din ukoll.
I knew it was coming	Kont naf li se jkun ġej
He knew.	Li konna.
There is no money.	M'hemm l-ebda flus.
That’s hard for me.	Dik hija diffiċli għalija.
My friend was right.	Ħabib tiegħi kellu raġun.
Lots of time.	Ħafna ħin.
I don’t want to go back there.	Ma rridx immur lura hemm.
Could anyone still do that?	Għadu xi ħadd seta' jagħmel dan?.
I know he won't	Naf li mhux se tagħmel hekk
This was not how we did it.	Dan ma kienx kif għamilna.
I went first.	Jien mort l-ewwel.
I have never been so happy	Qatt ma kont daqshekk kuntent
It really helps.	Huwa tassew jgħin.
I haven’t thought about it in years.	Ilni snin ma naħseb dwarha.
She didn't.	Hija ma.
I have no more time now.	M'għandix aktar ħin issa.
He didn’t even think to think.	Lanqas biss ħaseb biex jaħseb.
Neither are you.	Lanqas int.
I did as you wanted	Jien għamilt kif ridt int
I think better than anyone could have expected	Naħseb aħjar milli kulħadd seta' jistenna
So we know.	Hekk nafu.
I can’t tell you why he’s so big, but he is.	Ma nistax ngħidlek għaliex hu daqshekk kbir, imma hu.
I can tell you who you are	Nista’ ngħidlek min int
Just that he was a man.	Biss li kien raġel.
I had to do it.	Kelli nagħmel dan.
If he were alive.	Kieku kien jgħix.
That’s a very good thing.	Dik hija ħaġa tajba ħafna.
I didn't know you were there	Ma kontx naf li inti qiegħed hemm
A little more.	Ftit aktar.
Not alone.	Mhux waħdu.
Do we really need another ?.	Għandna bżonn tassew ieħor?.
She was, if she knew.	Kienet, kieku kienet taf.
I have been waiting so long.	Ilni tant nistenna.
I still am, in fact	Għadni, fil-fatt
If something goes wrong.	Jekk xi ħaġa tmur ħażin.
I’ve been talking to him for hours, about something	Jien stajt nitkellem miegħu għal sigħat, dwar xi ħaġa
It's not usually about talking to everyone.	Normalment ma tkunx xi ħaġa li titkellem dwarha ma’ kulħadd.
I thought that was it	Ħsibt li dan kien
I didn’t have the time	Ma kellix il-ħin
Whatever you had to do.	Tkun xi tkun kellek tagħmel.
I thought I wanted to	Ħsibt li ridt
No, that wasn't good enough.	Le, dan ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed milli jidher.
Tired of going to school	Għajjien li mmur l-iskola
I can’t do any other.	Ma nista nagħmel l-ebda ieħor.
But we were always there for each other.	Imma dejjem konna hemm għal xulxin.
I want to see what they do	Irrid nara x'qed jagħmlu
Maybe very good.	Forsi tajjeb ħafna.
I was tired, but happy.	Kont għajjien, imma kuntent.
I’m not the only one doing this.	Jien mhux l-uniku wieħed li jagħmel dan.
A man came to the door	Ġie raġel lejn il-bieb
And more than that, it was the truth.	U aktar minn hekk, kienet il-verità.
He said he was glad.	Qal li kien ferħan.
You died badly from that.	Int miet ħażin minn hekk.
I think that will be all	Naħseb li se jkun kollox
I want to take this	Irrid nieħu dan
But that probably wouldn't happen.	Imma dan probabbilment ma kienx se jiġri.
I was never worried.	Qatt ma kont inkwetat.
But she was his alone.	Imma hi kienet biss tiegħu.
More often than not.	Aktar spiss milli taħseb.
That must be a lot of money.	Dak irid ikun ħafna flus.
I knew it wasn't him	Kont naf li ma kienx hu
And this is one.	U dan huwa wieħed.
I have one problem.	Għandi problema waħda.
I think she was doing that	Naħseb li kienet qed tagħmel hekk
He just wants to win.	Huwa biss irid jirbaħ.
I thought, it’s time	Ħsibt, wasal iż-żmien
I never did.	Qatt ma għamilt.
I’ve done this before, at home	Jien għamilt dan qabel, id-dar
Now it is too late.	Issa huwa tard wisq.
I'll wait.	Ħa nistenna.
I am now and always will be your friend	Jien issa u dejjem se nkun ħabib tiegħek
I never thought about it at the time.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha dak iż-żmien.
I hope there are no problems	Nispera li ma jkunx hemm problemi
I will do it again.	Se nerġa' nagħmel.
For every good time, there must be a bad one.	Għal kull żmien tajjeb, għandu jkun hemm ħażin.
I had thought to say	I kellha ħsibt li ngħid
We have each other back.	Aħna għandna lura lil xulxin.
This is unlikely.	Dan mhux probabbli.
It was too long.	Kien twil wisq.
I didn’t have to wait too long	Ma kellix għalfejn nistenna wisq
I want you to be as happy as you can	Irrid li tkun ferħan kemm tista’
He does not know in advance what he is doing.	Ma jafx minn qabel x’qed jagħmel.
I take that back.	Nieħu dak lura.
Something is out there.	Xi ħaġa tidher barra hawn.
What will be, will be.	Dak li se jkun, se jkun.
A very big one, too	Wieħed kbir ħafna, ukoll
But you don’t have to be.	Imma m'għandekx tkun.
I can tell who she is	Nista’ ngħid li hi min hi
He had to be here.	Huwa kellu jkun hawn.
I don’t know if this can be done.	Ma nafx jekk dan jistax isir.
There was another thing he had to do first.	Kien hemm ħaġa oħra li kellu jagħmel l-ewwel.
I'm not doing that	Jien hekk mhux qed nagħmel dan
I love my home.	Inħobb id-dar tiegħi.
I was three years old at the time	Dak iż-żmien kelli tliet snin
I thought you would be interested to know.	Ħsibt li inti tkun interessat li tkun taf.
I'm very happy	Jien kuntent ħafna
You were here.	Inti kont hawn.
I don’t want a man.	Ma rridx raġel.
But not fast.	Imma mhux malajr.
We had a chance to do that.	Kellna ċans nagħmlu dan.
This we do not have and will not do.	Dan m'għandniex u mhux se nagħmlu.
It was really hard for me.	Kien tassew diffiċli għalija.
I didn’t know why I went, just that I went	Jien ma kontx naf għalfejn mort, biss li mort
I know a few people like that	Naf ftit nies hekk
It's been years	Ilni snin
I couldn’t think of that	Ma stajtx naħseb dwar dan
He came out.	Ħareġ.
I needed something really fast.	Kelli bżonn xi ħaġa tassew malajr.
Everyone is scared.	Kulħadd jibża’.
I already knew about that	Diġà kont naf dwar dak
There's just you and me.	Hemm int u jien biss.
I couldn’t help but think how she looked	Ma stajtx ma naħseb kemm kienet tidher
I was willing to do about anything	Kont lest li nagħmel dwar xi ħaġa
It works and works well.	Jaħdem u jaħdem tajjeb.
It wasn't fast.	Ma kienx malajr.
I needed one yesterday	Kelli bżonn wieħed ilbieraħ
Everyone has enough of everything.	Kulħadd għandu biżżejjed minn kollox.
It comes from above.	Ġej minn fuq.
I needed time to understand some things	Jien kelli bżonn iż-żmien biex nifhem xi affarijiet
I can't think where	Ma nistax naħseb fejn
I knew who they were	Kont naf min kienu
And boy, did he ever leave.	U tifel, qatt telaq.
You don’t have the time.	M'għandekx il-ħin.
I still couldn’t believe it had really happened	Għadni ma stajtx nemmen li kien ġara tassew
I'm waiting for something to happen	Qed nistenna li jiġri xi ħaġa
Which is just one great thing.	Li hija biss ħaġa waħda kbira.
I just wanted to know if I was okay	Ridt biss inkun naf jekk kontx tajjeb
I always thought there would be time	Dejjem ħsibt li jkun hemm ħin
I wanted to do that.	Jien ridt nagħmel hekk.
This will help the problem.	Dan se jgħin il-problema.
He is a very good teacher.	Huwa għalliem tajjeb ħafna.
I knew it was too late	Kont naf li kien tard wisq
That he knows.	Dan jaf hu.
I think they do a good job.	Naħseb li jagħmlu xogħol tajjeb.
After a few years you only know	Wara ftit snin taf biss
This can happen.	Dan jista' jiġri.
I know this is hard for you	Naf li dan huwa diffiċli għalik
It may be too late now.	Issa jista’ jkun tard wisq.
I won’t say it was easy	Mhux se ngħid li kien faċli
Not alone.	Mhux waħdek.
I also heard that I looked pretty good	Smajt ukoll li kont tidher pjuttost tajba
But he is more than that.	Imma hu aktar minn hekk.
I had to do something fast	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa malajr
I would like to do more	Nixtieq nagħmel aktar
You have to come and stay with us.	Għandek tiġi u toqgħod magħna.
I think he should be back soon	Naħseb li għandu jkun lura dalwaqt
This and try.	Dan u jipprova.
I thought that for years	Ħsibt li għal snin
As she did now.	Kif għamlet issa.
It still does.	Għadha tagħmel.
I just want to be here and now	Irrid biss inkun hawn u issa
The work was much easier after that.	Ix-xogħol kien ħafna aktar faċli wara dak.
I want to be someone	Irrid inkun xi ħadd
No, not that.	Le, mhux dik.
I was going to try mine	Kont se nipprova tiegħi
It's been a long time.	Ilu ma tantx ilu hemm.
I know they are a lot of money	Naf li huma ħafna flus
That’s done now.	Dak sar issa.
All this I loved, already	Dan kollu kont inħobb, diġà
But nothing will come.	Imma mhu se jiġi xejn.
You seem to know everything.	Jidher li taf kollox.
Sorry, you can't do that.	Jiddispjaċini, ma tistax tagħmel dan.
It's pretty good.	Huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
Nothing does, of course.	Xejn ma, ovvjament.
Great person.	Persuna kbira.
No, that wasn’t all he wanted to do.	Le, dan ma kienx dak kollu li ried jagħmel.
I'll talk to you later	Ser nerġa' nitkellem miegħek aktar tard
But try it once.	Imma ipprova darba.
There had to be some other way.	Kellu jkun hemm xi mod ieħor.
I wanted to come from behind	Ridt ġej minn wara
There were many who did not know.	Kien hemm ħafna li ma kienx jaf.
I thought it might be difficult	Ħsibt li jista 'jkun xi ħaġa diffiċli
I like to be scared	Inħobb nibża’
I can't tell who it was.	Ma nistax ngħid min kien.
That’s what happened.	Huwa dak li ġara.
Good for me, but both.	Tajjeb għalija, imma kemm.
I couldn’t do it all the time.	Ma stajtx nagħmel il-ħin kollu.
I know nothing about this	Ma naf xejn dwar dan
I don't really need one.	I ma verament bżonn wieħed.
I wanted to tell you first	Ridt ngħidlek l-ewwel
You know that.	Inti taf dan.
I just thought about it	Ħsibt biss dwarha
I wasn’t going to say anything	Jien ma kont se ngħid xejn
I wanted to be me	Ridt inkun jien
I want to see something	Irrid li tara xi ħaġa
I couldn’t see that happening	Ma stajtx nara li jiġri
He says so.	Jgħid hekk.
He did so.	Hekk għamel.
I didn’t believe that	Ma kontx nemmen li
Everyone is talking about it.	Kulħadd qed jitkellem dwarha.
I have to be able to do that.	Għandi nkun kapaċi nagħmel dan.
I'll be back there soon enough.	Jien ser inkun lura hemm malajr biżżejjed.
But she is as good as any person.	Imma hi tajba daqs kull persuna.
I can really do this job.	Nista 'verament nagħmel dan ix-xogħol.
If you were there, you know what happened.	Kieku kont hemm, taf x’ġara.
So does everyone.	Hekk jagħmel kulħadd.
I don’t seem capable.	Jien ma jidhirx kapaċi.
Like so much.	Bħal tant.
Probably more.	Probabbilment aktar.
It was not yet time.	Kien għadu ma kienx iż-żmien.
I have to be out there	Għandi nkun hemm barra
It is, in fact, much more.	Huwa, fil-fatt, ħafna aktar.
Here it comes now.	Hawn ġej issa.
I think in the morning.	Naħseb filgħodu.
In fact he did.	Fil-fatt huwa għamel.
I really think he is.	Verament naħseb li hu.
Maybe none of this would be good.	Forsi xejn minn dan ma jkun tajjeb.
I think it’s a little late	Naħseb li huwa ftit tard
One is a boy.	Wieħed huwa tifel.
I knew he knew that too	Kont naf li kien jaf dan ukoll
I did work after I made some friends there	Jien għamilt xogħol wara li għamilt xi ħbieb hemmhekk
If not, too bad.	Jekk le, ħażin wisq.
Not as big as you think.	Mhux daqshekk kbir kif taħseb.
No one died.	Ħadd ma miet.
Here I am alone.	Hawn jien biss.
I was too quick about it.	Kont malajr wisq dwarha.
It would be hard not to.	Ikun diffiċli li ma.
That’s not how it usually is with me.	Dak mhux kif normalment ikun miegħi.
I loved every job.	Jien kont inħobb kull xogħol.
He never looked back.	Qatt ma ħares lura.
But not this.	Imma mhux dan.
Time had passed.	Il-ħin kien għadda.
I know he's with him	Naf li hu ma’ hu
They were never.	Kienu qatt.
But he has not yet begun to speak.	Imma għadu ma beda jitkellem.
I couldn’t tell the truth	Ma stajtx ngħid il-verità
It sure is.	Huwa żgur.
I wasn’t good enough	Jien ma kontx tajjeb biżżejjed
And, of course, she was right.	U, ovvjament, kellha raġun.
No, of course you can't stay here.	Le, ovvjament ma tistax toqgħod hawn.
Like, really good.	Bħal, tassew tajjeb.
I can never go back with him.	Qatt ma nista’ nerġa’ lura miegħu.
It will not be otherwise.	Mhux se jkun mod ieħor.
More than you know, too.	Aktar milli taf, ukoll.
This will help.	Dan se jgħin.
It doesn’t want to happen here.	Ma jridx jiġri hawn.
That is what we are doing there.	Li huwa dak li qed nagħmlu hemmhekk.
But that’s not a bad thing.	Imma dik mhix xi ħaġa ħażina.
I was good with one or the other	Kont tajjeb ma' wieħed jew ieħor
This is a good thing.	Din hija ħaġa tajba.
I wish it was as easy as that.	Nixtieq li kien faċli daqs dik.
No one else will.	Ħadd ieħor mhu se jagħmel dan.
It's coming.	Huwa ġej.
And me.	U jien.
I'm not sure.	M'inix ċert.
I need say no more.	Ikolli bżonn ngħid mhux aktar.
It may be better than you think.	Jista 'jkun aħjar milli taħseb.
He wanted to help.	Ried jgħin.
I need to know that he is good	Għandi bżonn inkun naf li hu tajjeb
I knew he was thinking about something	Kont naf li kien qed jaħseb dwar xi ħaġa
He seemed to be alone.	Deher li kien waħdu.
There was no one who could talk about it.	Ma kien hemm ħadd li seta’ jitkellem dwar dan.
And, of course, there may not be.	U, ovvjament, jista 'ma jkunx hemm.
Until she did.	Sakemm għamlet.
There doesn’t have to be one.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun hemm wieħed.
I’m not going to take one.	Jien mhux se nieħu waħda.
It will not happen.	Mhux se jiġri.
This was not going so well.	Dan ma kienx sejjer daqshekk tajjeb.
I shouldn’t have been so hard	Ma kellix inkun daqshekk diffiċli
I wanted to know.	Ridt tkun taf.
I hope to be the first of many	Nispera li jkun l-ewwel minn ħafna
But we only had one car.	Imma kellna karozza waħda biss.
This is where you do your things.	Dan huwa fejn tagħmel l-affarijiet tiegħek.
If it weren’t too late.	Kieku ma kinitx tard wisq.
I needed to make some friends	Kelli bżonn nagħmel xi ħbieb
We can do the same.	Nistgħu nagħmlu l-istess.
I'm not sure about that.	M'inix ċert minn dan.
I couldn’t believe he had just done so	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien għadu kif għamel hekk
I have fun alone.	Jien nieħu gost waħdi.
It is our only chance.	Huwa l-uniku ċans tagħna.
I couldn't speak or think anymore	Ma stajtx nitkellem jew naħseb aktar
But do only one thing.	Imma tagħmel ħaġa waħda biss.
I had to say something before	I kellha għid xi ħaġa qabel
Probably, he was right.	Probabbilment, kellu raġun.
With him it was often better not to say anything.	Miegħu spiss kien aħjar li ma tgħid xejn.
Better than me.	Aħjar minni.
We can only be who we are.	Nistgħu nkunu biss min aħna.
He saw where we would both be.	Huwa ra fejn se nkunu t-tnejn li huma.
I hope it helps you	Nispera li tkun ta' għajnuna għalik
I really thought that would work.	Verament ħsibt li dak kien jaħdem.
I see why.	Nara għaliex.
And not who.	U mhux min.
I have seen and heard enough	Rajt u smajt biżżejjed
This is yours.	Dan hu tiegħek.
I want it to be so today	Nixtieq li jkun hekk illum
I am very sorry about yesterday	Jiddispjaċini ħafna dwar il-bieraħ
This was better.	Dan kien aħjar.
I can’t believe how quickly this book came together.	Ma nistax nemmen kemm malajr ġie flimkien dan il-ktieb.
i can't either.	ma nistax lanqas.
I wonder if he can see	Nistaqsi jekk jistax jara
It was about something.	Kienet dwar xi ħaġa.
It happened today.	Ġara llum.
So was he.	Hekk kien hu.
She can do it.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan.
I did very little today.	Għamilt ftit li xejn illum.
I can't hear anything.	Ma nista’ nisma’ xejn.
I have an idea right now	Għandi idea bħalissa
I can understand why	Kapaċi nifhem għaliex
No one comes here, and no one leaves.	Ħadd ma jiġi hawn, u ħadd ma jitlaq.
I never thought there could be a child	Qatt ma ħsibt li jista’ jkun hemm tifel
I will not ask again	Mhux se nerġa’ nistaqsi
I don’t even eat.	Lanqas ma niekol.
I don’t have to take that	M'għandix għalfejn nieħu dan
I'm very happy	Jien kuntent ħafna
There had to be something wrong with me being there.	Kellu jkun hemm xi ħaġa ħażina li jien qiegħed hemm.
There is a better way.	Hemm mod aħjar.
He was ready with me.	Kien lest miegħi.
I tell you.	Jien ngħidlek.
You may not know what it is.	Ma tistax tkun taf x’inhu.
Nothing happened.	Ma ġara xejn.
This happens too.	Dan jiġri wisq.
This could have really happened to anyone.	Dan seta’ verament ġara lil xi ħadd.
And so over and over again.	U hekk aktar u aktar mill-ġdid.
I wonder if anyone has thought of this before	Nistaqsi li ħadd ma ħaseb dwar dan qabel
It was me and something else, something more	Jien kont jien u xi ħaġa oħra, xi ħaġa aktar
I didn’t even have to try	Lanqas kelli għalfejn nipprova
Nor was it mine.	U lanqas kienet tiegħi.
he thought	hu ħaseb
Boy? 	Tifel?
And too big.	U kbir wisq.
Definitely not so bad.	Żgur li ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
Maybe it was both.	Forsi kien it-tnejn.
It is so bad.	Hija tant ħażina.
Everything was his.	Kollox kien tiegħu.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwarha.
But not for me.	Imma mhux għalija.
I had a hard enough time for you	Kelli żmien diffiċli biżżejjed biex inti
Nothing has ever been so great yet.	Xejn qatt ma kien daqshekk għadu.
It was coming fast, too fast.	Kien ġej malajr, malajr wisq.
The house was big enough.	Id-dar kienet kbira biżżejjed.
This is just too good.	Dan huwa biss wisq tajjeb.
But he would survive.	Imma kien se jgħix.
But it’s my job, you see.	Imma huwa xogħol tiegħi, tara.
I thought it would help	Ħsibt li se jgħin
It was hard for everyone.	Kien diffiċli għal kulħadd.
The problem is with him.	Il-problema hija miegħu.
I can’t wait to hear this	Ma nistax nistenna biex nisma dan
And there is more to come.	U hemm aktar minn fejn ġej.
I knew what he was doing	Kont naf x’kien qed jagħmel
You must be tired.	Trid tkun għajjien.
You know your home.	Taf id-dar tiegħek.
I was ready for whatever happened next	Kont lest għal dak kollu li ġara wara
But it was not something he could do for a living.	Imma mhux xi ħaġa li seta’ jagħmel għal xogħol.
That was when it happened.	Dak kien meta ġara.
I’ll talk to him when he gets home.	Jien ser nitkellem miegħu meta jasal id-dar.
I couldn't tell anyone	Ma stajt ngħid lil ħadd
She really wants to do something about it.	Hi tassew trid tagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
It had to be me.	Kelli nkun jien.
No one can do as he does.	Ħadd ma jista’ jagħmel hekk kif jagħmel hu.
I know, but it's good	Naf, imma hu tajjeb
I couldn’t help but fall in love with him	Ma stajtx ma nħobbx miegħu
I couldn’t think of anything else to say	Ma stajt naħseb xi ħaġa oħra xi ngħid
I know you are right	Naf li għandek raġun
Please do this.	Jekk jogħġbok, tagħmel dan.
Once I was young.	Darba kont żgħir.
I may have done the same	I jista 'jkun għamilt l-istess
He plays too well.	Jilgħab tajjeb wisq.
I'm not much better.	Jien ma tantx aħjar.
I could see what was coming	Stajt nara x’kien ġej
If he hadn’t done it tonight, he would never have done it.	Kieku ma jagħmilx illejla, qatt ma kien jagħmel dan.
I was right, this was wrong.	Kelli raġun, dan kien ħażin.
I just thought you should know about it	Ħsibt biss li għandek tkun taf dwar dan
I would say it takes a lot	Jien ngħid li tieħu ħafna
I thought it was good	Ħsibt li kien tajjeb
This should not happen.	Dan m'għandux jiġri.
And that’s where he is today.	U dak hu fejn hu llum.
That's all they have	Dan huwa dak kollu li għandhom
I did more than one man would expect.	Għamilt aktar milli wieħed jistenna minn kull raġel.
I was here when it happened	Jien kont hawn meta ġara
I probably have nothing to do with it	Probabbilment m'għandi xejn miegħu
I want to be there too, and soon	Irrid hemm ukoll, u dalwaqt
He never got there.	Qatt ma wasal hemm.
I just don’t think it’s going to happen	Jien biss ma naħsibx li se jiġri
That was something she needed more than ever now.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa li kellha bżonn aktar minn qatt qabel issa.
That can happen without.	Li jista 'jiġri mingħajr.
No one seems to be home.	Ħadd ma jidher li hu d-dar.
I have everything here	Għandi kollox hawn
I had to think of something to say	Kelli naħseb xi ħaġa xi ngħid
But it never happened.	Imma qatt ma ġara.
That’s definitely not here.	Dak żgur mhux hawn.
I couldn't wait	Ma stajtx nistenna
It wasn't long.	Ma kienx twil.
It wasn't going well.	Ma kienx sejjer tajjeb.
Some time.	Xi ftit ħin.
And he did it again.	U kien jerġa’ jagħmel.
Many, many years now.	Ħafna, ħafna snin issa.
I can't understand how	Ma nistax nifhem kif
Obviously we can't.	Ovvjament ma nistgħux.
I couldn't hear anything later	Ma stajt nisma’ xejn wara
That's not what they are.	Dak mhux huma.
I didn't know what to do	Ma kontx naf x’se jagħmel
She is not good.	Hija mhix tajba.
It’s not much, you know.	Mhuwiex ħafna, taf.
I couldn't go back	Ma stajtx lura
I only know everyone.	Naf lil kulħadd biss.
Kellha.	Kellha.
That was her.	Dik kienet hi.
I actually like to do that	Fil-fatt inħobb nagħmel hekk
It has not been an easy year.	Ma kinitx sena faċli.
I hope you are better now	Nispera li int aħjar issa
I never wanted it all to happen, you know	Qatt ma ridt li dan kollu jiġri, taf
And not only that.	U mhux hekk biss.
Well, of course, you’re a kid.	Ukoll, ovvjament, int tifel.
Not so, he said.	Mhux hekk, qal.
Most people do this	Ħafna nies jagħmlu dan
I didn’t know there was another	Ma kontx naf li kien hemm ieħor
As it seems to be going.	Kif jidher li sejjer.
I had to do it hours ago.	I kellha tagħmel dan sigħat ilu.
But we are not.	Imma aħna le.
This works very well.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
It may not work.	Jista 'jaħdem jista' ma jkunx.
I hope all is well for everyone	Nispera li kollox tajjeb għal kulħadd
It will be you.	Se tkun int.
Not even when she had to.	Lanqas meta kellha.
I had a lot of people behind me.	Kelli ħafna nies lura minni.
First I wanted to talk to you	L-ewwel ridt nitkellem miegħek
Try some time !.	Ipprova xi żmien!.
I will never be good again	Qatt ma nkun tajjeb mill-ġdid
But now look at what they have.	Imma issa ħares lejn dak li għandhom.
That’s not for me.	Dak mhux għalija.
Not ready.	Mhux lest.
Here's another one.	Hawn ieħor.
This has long been coming.	Dan ilu żmien twil ġej.
I know how and by whom	Inkun naf kif u minn min
I had to see this coming	I kellha nara dan ġej
He should do it or do nothing.	Għandu jagħmel dan jew ma jagħmel xejn.
That’s what it’s supposed to be.	Dak hu li suppost ikun.
There are many out there.	Hemm ħafna hemmhekk.
You loved it.	Int iħobb.
The last thing he wants is another.	L-aħħar ħaġa li jrid hija oħra.
You were coming back.	Inti kien ġej lura.
I did it as soon as possible.	Għamilt malajr kemm jista’ jkun.
But now she is.	Imma issa hi.
I knew you would be alone	Kont naf li inti tkun waħdek
I didn’t need too much	Ma kellix bżonn wisq
I have no idea what's going on there	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'hemm hemmhekk
He was not there at the time.	Dak iż-żmien ma kienx hemm.
But he knew better.	Imma kien jaf aħjar.
And maybe we were.	U forsi konna.
I wasn't sure where	Ma kontx ċert fejn
This is where it gets difficult.	Dan huwa fejn isir diffiċli.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
Obviously this can happen.	Ovvjament dan jista' jiġri.
I had no idea she was going to do that	Ma kelli l-ebda idea li kienet se tagħmel dan
It didn’t make anything easy for me.	Hija ma għamlet xejn faċli għalija.
I wish I never did.	Nixtieq li qatt ma għamilt.
He waits.	Huwa jistenna.
I can't talk to him right now	Ma nistax nitkellem miegħu bħalissa
It really helps.	Huwa tassew jgħin.
I used to be a small child.	Jien kont inkun tifel żgħir.
It has to go after.	Għandu jmur wara.
This is your last chance.	Dan huwa l-aħħar ċans tiegħek.
I really did, many times	Verament għamilt, ħafna drabi
I know who he is now	Naf min hu issa
I couldn’t do it forever	Ma stajtx nagħmel għal dejjem
I had to do it from the outside	Kelli nagħmel dan minn barra
Not much at all.	Mhux ħafna xejn.
It was the first time.	Kienet l-ewwel darba.
I was willing to do whatever it took	Kont lest li nagħmel dak kollu li kien hemm bżonn
We don't need to.	M'għandniex bżonn.
I saw where he was going.	Rajt fejn kien sejjer b’dan.
But we didn't.	Imma mhux hekk għamilna.
Sure, that's one way to do it.	Żgur, dak huwa mod wieħed kif tagħmel dan.
This is not a bad idea.	Din mhix idea ħażina.
I don't need any help	M'għandi bżonn l-ebda għajnuna
He did not know where they were.	Ma kienx jaf fejn kienu.
I think I didn’t even hear it.	Naħseb li lanqas biss smajt.
I just want you to know that it's not big.	Irrid biss li tkun taf li m’huwiex kbir.
Maybe you’re right and there’s something more out there.	Forsi għandek raġun u hemm xi ħaġa aktar hemmhekk.
I really needed to talk to someone	Verament kelli bżonn nitkellem ma’ xi ħadd
I thought I was someone else.	Ħsibt li kont xi ħadd ieħor.
I'm not sure about that	M'inix ċert minn dan
I'm not ready for that	Jien mhux lest għal dan
I never knew that before	Qatt ma kont naf li qabel
I wasn’t alone for long	Jien ma kontx waħdi twil
Look at the time.	Ħares lejn il-ħin.
And she was good to us.	U kienet tajba magħna.
It couldn't be.	Ma setax ikun.
You have to stay, as we do.	Int trid toqgħod, kif nagħmlu aħna.
I heard what you are doing	Smajt x'qed tagħmel
I probably have, actually	Probabbilment għandi, fil-fatt
Well, they should do it.	Ukoll, għandhom jagħmlu dan.
I heard that.	Smajt hekk.
That's not my job.	Dak mhux xogħol tiegħi.
I didn’t know exactly when	Ma kontx naf eżatt meta
You're better than that.	Int aħjar minn dan.
I hope nothing was wrong	Jien nittama li xejn ma kien ħażin
Nothing is here.	Xejn mhu hawn.
But that is a problem.	Imma dik hija problema.
I need to do more.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel aktar.
I know why you are here	Naf għaliex inti hawn
He would have.	Kien ikollu.
The problem was time.	Il-problema kienet iż-żmien.
And many, many people do.	U ħafna, ħafna nies jagħmlu.
As it were.	Kif kien.
I will be together soon	Jien se nkun flimkien dalwaqt
I was just worried about my friend	Kont inkwetat biss dwar ħabib tiegħi
I'm not sure why.	Ma nafx ċert għaliex.
I have done this a few times.	Għamilt dan xi ftit drabi.
He is a morning person.	Huwa persuna filgħodu.
Come now.	Ejja issa.
He was not happy.	Ma kienx kuntent.
It's quick and easy.	Huwa malajr u faċli.
He was right too.	Kellu raġun ukoll.
Your work is finished.	Ix-xogħol tiegħek lest.
He had time.	Kellu ħin.
He knows where he wants to be.	Jaf fejn irid ikun.
You can do that.	Tista 'tagħmel dan.
I knew better than that	Kont naf aħjar minn dan
She knew.	Kienet taf.
And it never does.	U qatt ma jagħmel.
I did a good job there.	Għamilt xogħol tajjeb hemmhekk.
I needed to know if it was really you	Kelli nkun naf jekk kienx verament int
It's not up to you, you want to know that.	Hija mhix sa dan, trid tkun taf li.
I think she was there before	Naħseb li kienet hemm qabel
I know you have the same problem	Naf li għandek l-istess problema
And it was long before his time.	U kien ilu ħafna qabel iż-żmien tiegħu.
Well, maybe he should.	Ukoll, forsi għandu.
I knew what was going to happen.	Kont naf x’kien se jiġri.
On, on, on.	Fuq, fuq, fuq.
I'm late.	Jien tard.
It was not an easy time.	Ma kienx żmien faċli.
And it’s safe to say he won’t do that.	U tajjeb li tgħid li mhux se tagħmel dan.
I was never afraid	Jien qatt ma kont nibża’
He just didn’t want to think about it right now.	Huwa biss ma riedx jaħseb dwarha bħalissa.
But that's what it is.	Imma huwa dak li hu.
I really hope you are so	Verament nittama li inti hekk
I just might as well be able to do that	I biss jista 'jkun kapaċi nagħmel dan
Things never do.	L-affarijiet qatt ma jagħmlu.
It was a great thing.	Kienet xi ħaġa kbira.
Prove that is not so.	Jipprova li mhux hekk.
I can’t go back now.	Ma nistax lura issa.
He can go outside.	Jista 'jmur barra.
I understand that would be bad for you	Nifhem li jkun ħażin għalik
But me.	Imma jien.
It seemed not quite mine.	Deher mhux pjuttost tiegħi.
In fact the same happens here.	Fil-fatt l-istess jiġri hawn.
If there is anything else.	Jekk hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
I couldn’t help but fall in love with him	Ma stajtx ma nħobbx lura miegħu
I thought something was wrong	Ħsibt li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina
I wasn't ready.	Ma kontx lest.
It was a great one.	Kienet waħda kbira.
It is happening right now.	Qed jiġri bħalissa.
I really can’t wait.	Verament ma nistax nistenna.
I think he will survive	Naħseb li se jgħix
That actually happened once.	Dak fil-fatt ġara darba.
I didn’t want to do that	Jien ma ridtx nagħmel dan
You have to come with me.	Għandek tiġi miegħi.
That's what you're saying.	Dak qed tgħid.
But really, he is.	Imma tassew, hu.
No, just a little.	Le, ftit biss.
You don’t want to either.	Ma tridx lanqas.
I can understand that.	Kapaċi nifhem dan.
It's hard to do well	Huwa diffiċli li tagħmel tajjeb
Does anyone have any idea ?.	Xi ħadd għandu xi idea?.
He was the only person there.	Kien l-unika persuna hemmhekk.
You were everything to me.	Inti kont kollox għalija.
It would be easier if it were there.	Ikun aktar faċli kieku kienet hemm.
I've never been outside before	Qatt ma kont barra qabel
I had no idea it was so late	Ma kontx idea li kien daqshekk tard
You had to do it for you.	Kellek tagħmel dan għalik.
We know nothing.	Ma nafu xejn.
I knew who he was.	Kont naf min kien.
I can’t help but talk to him	Ma nistax ma nitkellem miegħu
You can do this sitting down.	Tista 'tagħmel dan bilqiegħda.
And that's it.	U dak hu.
I didn’t know how it would be	Ma kontx naf kif se jkun
Nobody wants to.	Ħadd ma jrid.
So it is with this work.	Hekk huwa ma 'dan ix-xogħol.
I’ll know when soon.	Jien ser inkun naf meta dalwaqt.
But there must be a way.	Imma jrid ikun hemm mod.
This should help.	Dan għandu jgħin.
I think he was tired	Naħseb li kien għajjien
I already know he does	Diġà naf li jagħmel hekk
There is no way we can do that.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
I thought I wanted to see	Ħsibt li ridt tara
I thought you would be.	Ħsibt li inti tkun.
He was trying to help	Kien qed jipprova jgħin
I didn’t have time to think about it	Ma kellix ħin naħseb dwarha
It's pretty bad.	Huwa pjuttost ħażin.
He has never done this before.	Qatt ma għamel dan qabel.
But you.	Imma int.
I just need to understand why.	Għandi bżonn biss nifhem għaliex.
I just have to.	Għandi biss.
I had no idea where we were	Ma kellix idea fejn konna
But so does everyone.	Imma hekk jagħmel kulħadd.
I try not to think too much about it	Nipprova ma naħsibx wisq dwar dan
Well, maybe not.	Ukoll, forsi le.
I really can’t wait.	Verament ma nistax nistenna.
I don’t know afterwards.	Ma nafx wara.
I haven’t thought about this for years	Ilni ma naħseb dwar dan għal snin
I have everything and more	Għandi dak kollu u aktar
I didn't know it was you	Ma kontx naf li kont int
I have what you say you need.	Għandi dak li tgħid li għandek bżonn.
He had to wait.	Kellu jistenna.
I couldn't eat anything	Ma stajt niekol xejn
As he knew this, he could not tell.	Kif kien jaf dan, ma setax jgħid.
It could not have been done otherwise	Ma setax isir mod ieħor
I couldn't sit down	Ma stajtx noqgħod bilqiegħda
She wasn't talking to me yet.	Kienet għadha ma kinitx qed titkellem miegħi.
Today.	Illum.
I was outside, sitting there.	Kont barra, bilqiegħda hemm.
You should do well in the morning.	Għandek tagħmel tajjeb filgħodu.
I thought he was going to be there	Ħsibt li kien se jkun hemm
But there is a problem.	Imma hemm problema.
It takes things.	Hija tieħu l-affarijiet.
I was no longer the same	Ma kontx aktar l-istess
Nobody knew what to say.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x’għandu jgħid.
I hadn’t seen much of anyone.	Jien ma kont rajt ħafna lil ħadd.
This is for.	Dan huwa għal.
I can’t see why someone wrong does such things	Ma nistax nara għaliex xi ħadd ħażin jagħmel affarijiet bħal dawn
The first was home.	L-ewwel kienet id-dar.
I don’t think it would.	Ma naħsibx li kieku.
I think she was right	Naħseb li kellha raġun
I think he was as surprised as we were	Naħseb li kien sorpriż daqs kemm konna aħna
He said ready.	Qal lest.
I wanted to know the truth	Ridt inkun naf il-verità
As it was, it was beautiful.	Kif kienet, kienet sabiħa.
I can’t believe what you have here	Ma nistax nemmen dak li għandek hawn
Maybe this, maybe that.	Forsi dan, forsi dak.
I couldn’t be more surprised	Ma stajtx inkun aktar sorpriż
I think you can go either way, with what you know.	Naħseb li tista 'tmur jew mod, ma' dak li taf.
I was worried about it.	Kont inkwetat dwarha.
And much more.	U ħafna aktar.
That’s not ready yet.	Dak għadu mhux lest.
Everyone has time.	Kulħadd għandu ħin.
I think that's a good thing	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba
I think you should go back.	Naħseb li għandek tmur lura.
It was going well.	Kien sejjer tajjeb.
I’m just one man.	Jien raġel wieħed biss.
That's pretty bad.	Dak pjuttost ħażin.
This week was no better.	Din il-ġimgħa ma kinitx aħjar.
Today was so good.	Illum kienet daqshekk tajba.
I just wanted to do that tonight	Jien biss ridt nagħmel dik illejla
But in fact this is a good thing.	Imma fil-fatt din hija ħaġa tajba.
Only you see.	Biss inti tara.
It was something else.	Kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
Your money, maybe, but not mine.	Flus tiegħek, forsi, imma mhux tiegħi.
He said he would just watch.	Qal li jkollu biss jara.
She wasn’t just beautiful.	Hija ma kinitx biss sabiħa.
I didn’t want to hear any more	Ma ridtx nisma aktar
I can’t believe all that time has passed	Ma nistax nemmen li dak iż-żmien kollu għadda
And no one since.	U ħadd minn dak iż-żmien.
It doesn’t look so bad.	Ma jidhirx daqshekk ħażin.
It's none of these.	Hu xejn minn dawn.
I didn't know what was going on.	Ma kontx naf x’kien qed jiġri.
Maybe it wasn't.	Forsi ma kinitx.
I was glad it wasn’t.	Kont ferħan li ma kienx.
You are not.	M'intix.
You really don't want to be on the sidelines.	Int verament ma tridx tkun fuq barra ta 'dak.
It just keeps coming.	Jibqa’ ġej biss.
I have so much fun.	Jien nieħu gost hekk.
I know a man, actually	Naf raġel, fil-fatt
Tell me soon what you are doing.	Tgħidli dalwaqt x'qed tagħmel.
Or a little is.	Jew xi ftit huwa.
I understand more now.	Nifhem aktar issa.
It was great.	Kien kbir.
You want it back.	Trid lura.
You saw a little here or there.	Inti rajt ftit hawn jew hemm.
To work he must survive.	Biex jaħdem irid jgħix.
I make money.	Nagħmel flus.
I want you to tell me everything	Irrid li tgħidli kollox
I didn't know anything	Ma kont naf xejn
It was good.	Kien tajjeb.
We know what you're doing.	Nafu x'qed tagħmel.
I didn’t want to hear any more	Ma ridtx nisma aktar
I'm not like that anymore	Jien m'iniex hekk aktar
I will be back for more soon	Dalwaqt ser inkun lura għal aktar nitkellem
He did so, it seemed, just about everyone.	Hekk għamel, deher, biss dwar kulħadd.
I’ve seen this for a while.	Jien rajt dan għal xi żmien.
But there it was.	Imma kien hemm.
Why, no one knows.	Għaliex, ħadd ma jaf.
I know exactly where she is	Naf eżatt fejn hi
He was a pretty big man.	Kien raġel pjuttost kbir.
Appears in.	Jidher fi.
You’ve probably seen the same thing.	X'aktarx li rajt l-istess ħaġa.
He wasn't thinking about it.	Ma kienx jaħseb dwarha.
They are quite difficult.	Huma pjuttost diffiċli.
Don't go.	M'għandekx tmur.
I couldn’t, of course.	Ma stajtx, ovvjament.
He has to leave today.	Għandu jitlaq illum.
I knew this was going to take some work	Kont naf li dan kien se jieħu xi xogħol
He needed to leave.	Kellu bżonn jitlaq.
There was so little time.	Kien hemm daqshekk ftit ħin.
She was never there.	Qatt ma kienet hemm.
I know what they are doing	Naf x'qed jagħmlu
I know all about it.	Naf kollox dwar dan.
Not coming back.	Mhux ġej lura.
I see things I couldn’t see how you are	Nara affarijiet li ma stajtx tara kif int
I would.	Nixtieq.
I never thought he could be right, not really	Qatt ma ħsibt li jista’ jkollu raġun, mhux verament
We need help.	Għandna bżonn l-għajnuna.
I just need some time	Għandi bżonn biss ftit ħin
That was very helpful to me.	Dik kienet ta’ għajnuna kbira għalija.
I didn't mean that	Ma ridtx ngħid hekk
I wonder if he is alone	Nistaqsi jekk hux waħdu
This is not very good around the house.	Dan mhux tajjeb ħafna madwar id-dar.
I expect them to do something	Nistenna li jagħmlu xi ħaġa
I had no idea there was a boy	Ma kellix idea li kien hemm tifel
But this is nothing.	Imma dan mhu xejn.
But so does everyone.	Imma hekk jagħmel kulħadd.
I haven't heard that in a long time	Kont ilni ma nisma’ hekk
I couldn't understand what was going on	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien qed jiġri
I love your home too	Jien inħobb id-dar tiegħek ukoll
But we really are better than that.	Imma tassew aħna aħjar minn hekk.
I know you know that	Naf li taf dan
I wasn’t always sure he was capable of doing that	Mhux dejjem kont ċert li kien kapaċi jagħmel dan
Just out that door there.	Biss minn dak il-bieb hemmhekk.
Me, I don’t want to do that.	Jien, ma rridx nagħmel hekk.
I want everything for him	Nixtieq kollox għalih
I loved to sit and listen	Kont inħobb noqgħod u nisma’
I just hadn't thought about it before	I biss ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan qabel
The work gets harder.	Ix-xogħol isir aktar diffiċli.
It has everything you need.	Għandu dak kollu li għandek bżonn.
Also you can see where this is going.	Ukoll tista 'tara fejn dan sejjer.
He would stay here forever.	Kien jibqa’ hawn għal dejjem ta’ dejjem.
I couldn't understand what was wrong.	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien ħażin.
Come to me, boy.	Ejja għandi, tifel.
I need to be a better man	Għandi bżonn inkun raġel aħjar
I believe we can.	Nemmen li nistgħu.
I was not here.	Ma kontx kont hawn.
I think you know everything.	Naħseb li taf kollox.
If you do, you'll see that you can.	Jekk tagħmel dan, tara li tista '.
She doesn't want that either.	Hija ma tridx li lanqas.
I can do many things	Kapaċi nagħmel ħafna affarijiet
I have all afternoon and evening	Għandi wara nofsinhar u filgħaxija kollha
I was too scared to think about it too much	Kont nibża’ wisq biex naħseb dwarha wisq
We don't know each other very well.	Ma tantx nafu lil xulxin.
I was a little scared	Kont nibża’ ftit
I didn’t really think so	Jien ma tantx ħsibt hekk
There would be nothing.	Ma jkun hemm xejn.
Everything went pretty well.	Kollox mar pjuttost tajjeb.
But it was years ago.	Imma kien snin ilu.
You see, we now know each other.	Tara, issa nafu lil xulxin.
I couldn't see what it was	Ma stajtx nara x’kien
Definitely what I was doing	Żgur li kont qed nagħmel
I didn't know anyone.	Ma kont naf lil ħadd.
They always have been, probably always will be.	Dejjem kienu, probabbilment dejjem se jkun.
He is seated.	Huwa bilqiegħda.
He had said enough.	Huwa kien qal biżżejjed.
It couldn’t have been otherwise.	Ma setax ikun mod ieħor.
This can be difficult.	Dan jista 'jkun diffiċli.
If you only knew.	Kieku taf biss.
Really good.	Tajjeb tassew.
Not sure about that.	Mhux ċert dwar dan.
It was just that.	Kien biss dak.
And here you come.	U hawn int ġej.
But someone wants to talk.	Imma xi ħadd irid jitkellem.
I'm sure I'm tired	Inkun żgur għajjien
It's not much.	Mhuwiex ħafna.
I am much better now	Jiena ħafna aħjar issa
I have something to say.	Għandi xi ngħid.
I have never had that before.	Qatt ma kelli dak qabel.
I didn’t need to think	Ma kellix bżonn naħseb
I didn’t want to ask before	Ma ridtx nistaqsi qabel
I should probably do that.	Probabbilment għandi nagħmel hekk.
I would be fine in the morning	Inkun tajjeb filgħodu
He can win.	Jista’ jirbaħ.
I knew he could be happy with me again	Kont naf li seta’ jerġa’ jkun kuntent miegħi
It couldn't be better.	Ma jistax ikun aħjar.
He looked really good.	Huwa deher tassew tajjeb.
I would be there.	Jien inkun hemm.
I can't wait any longer.	Ma nistax nistenna aktar.
I didn’t want to talk about it, either.	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwarha, lanqas.
I just wanted to eat something	Ridt biss li tiekol xi ħaġa
I'm here.	Jien hawn.
No one else died.	Ħadd ieħor ma miet.
All this is not so easy.	Dan kollu mhux daqshekk faċli.
More than ever.	Aktar minn qatt qabel.
Or maybe too much.	Jew forsi wisq.
I couldn't do anything for him	Jien ma stajt nagħmel xejn għalih
Both are the same.	It-tnejn huma l-istess.
No one really saw this coming.	Tassew ħadd ma ra dan ġej.
I didn’t believe I was telling the truth	Ma kontx nemmen li kont qed tgħid il-verità
That's all.	Dak kollu.
It was his home.	Kienet id-dar tiegħu.
But she is.	Imma hi.
I want to talk to you.	Irrid nitkellem miegħek.
My first husband was not a good man to me.	L-ewwel raġel tiegħi ma kienx raġel tajjeb għalija.
But there was something more than that.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa aktar minn hekk.
I wish I was here.	Nixtieq li kont hawn.
It's just not ready.	Huwa biss mhux lest.
A bit of a back	Daqsxejn ta 'wara
I will stay there again	Jien se nerġa' noqgħod hemm
I was tired all the time	Kont għajjien il-ħin kollu
We don't have time.	M'għandniex ħin.
She may not have been talking to us.	Jista’ jkun li ma kinitx qed titkellem magħna.
That's just great.	Dak huwa biss kbir.
I believe he also wants to talk to you	Nemmen li hu jrid ukoll jitkellem miegħek
If ever, definitely not anymore.	Jekk qatt, żgur li mhux aktar.
There wasn’t much time.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna ħin.
I had seen enough.	Kont rajt biżżejjed.
I had this problem once	Kelli din il-problema darba
It can happen.	Jista' jiġri.
I didn't get along with anyone like that	Jien ma kont tajjeb ma’ ħadd bħal dan
I went there this afternoon	Jien mort hemm illum wara nofsinhar
Sar.	Sar.
Neither do I for me.	Lanqas għandi għalija.
I just didn’t want that	Jien hekk ma ridtx hekk
I didn’t know anyone was out there	Ma kontx naf li xi ħadd kien hemm barra
I knew in advance that he was not going with anyone	Jien kont naf minn qabel li ma kien sejjer ma’ ħadd
He couldn’t tell how big he was.	Ma setax jgħid kemm hu kbir.
I love that everyone has a good time together.	Inħobb li kulħadd ikollu ħin tajjeb flimkien.
I was done with that	I kien lest ma 'dak
No one is coming back from that.	Ħadd mhu ġej lura minn hekk.
It could be good.	Jista 'jkun tajjeb.
There he goes.	Hemmhekk imur.
He knew it would probably not help.	Kien jaf li x’aktarx ma kienx se jgħin.
Not nearly long enough.	Mhux kważi twil biżżejjed.
I really needed someone to talk to.	Verament kelli bżonn xi ħadd biex nitkellem.
I had to do it	I kellha tagħmel dan
This may be the first time for me.	Dan jista 'jkun l-ewwel għalija.
Still very difficult.	Għadha diffiċli ħafna.
Come back.	Tiġi lura.
I have no idea what that is.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'inhu dak.
I knew better than to say no	Kont naf aħjar milli ngħid le
But he had something.	Imma kellu xi ħaġa.
Large or small.	Kbir jew żgħir.
They were either us or they are.	Kienu jew aħna jew huma.
I still can't see anyone	Għadni ma nista’ nara lil ħadd
I have to hope for that	Ikolli nittama għal dan
No one comes to have fun.	Ħadd ma jasal jieħu gost.
I really never did.	Jien verament qatt ma għamilt.
I can't understand what's wrong with you	Ma nistax nifhem x'inhu ħażin miegħek
I know nothing of what you are talking about	Jien ma naf xejn minn dak li titkellem
I said no at all	Jien għedt le għal kollox
It is supposed to look like this.	Huwa suppost jidher hekk.
I was doing a good job	Kont qed nagħmel xogħol tajjeb
This could not actually have happened.	Dan ma setax fil-fatt ġara.
You must be ready to go.	Trid tkun lest biex tmur.
Why is this happening.	Għaliex qed jiġri dan.
I hope it will help.	Nittama li se jgħin.
I just wanted to go home.	Ridt biss nerġa’ lura d-dar.
I was hoping to be there for longer	Kont nittama li jkun hemm għal aktar żmien
I know you are tired	Naf li inti għajjien
If he did.	Kieku għamel.
I think this will help	Naħseb li dan se jgħin
Not too much there.	Mhux wisq hemm.
I want to stay here.	Jiena li jrid jibqa’ hawn.
It never was.	Qatt ma kien.
They are us.	Huma aħna.
I need help, you know that	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna, inti taf li
I’ve been thinking, too.	Jien stajt naħseb, ukoll.
You are coming with me.	Int ġej miegħi.
But it was there all week.	Imma kien hemm il-ġimgħa kollha.
I am alone and alone	Jien waħdi u waħdi
I think for many.	Naħseb għal ħafna.
I would never say anything like that	Qatt ma ngħid xi ħaġa bħal dik
Obviously he doesn’t know.	Ovvjament ma jafx.
It really isn’t looking very good to me.	Huwa verament mhux qed jidher tajjeb ħafna għalija.
But he died before he could tell anyone.	Imma miet qabel ma seta’ jgħid lil xi ħadd.
I just hope you see this.	Nispera biss li jara dan.
You’re just someone who wants to know what’s going on there.	Int biss xi ħadd li jrid ikun jaf x'inhu jiġri hemmhekk.
A lot can happen.	Jista' jiġri ħafna.
I wasn't doing anything	Jien ma kont qed nagħmel xejn
I'm not ready for anything	Jien mhux lest għal dak kollu li jista’ jiġi
I didn’t want to say you were right	Ma ridtx ngħid li kellek raġun
I'm ready, he said	Jien lest, qal
Very good, actually.	Tajjeb ħafna, fil-fatt.
We don’t even know how it looked.	Lanqas biss nafu kif deher.
I'm willing to believe	Jien lest nemmen
Maybe we are.	Forsi aħna.
Say whatever.	Tgħid xi tkun.
This could not work.	Dan ma setax jaħdem.
It took one to know one.	Ħa wieħed biex ikun jaf wieħed.
It goes above and beyond.	Tmur fuq kollox.
Sorry I did	Jiddispjaċini li għamilt
Now, more than ever.	Issa, aktar minn qatt qabel.
I ask later.	Nistaqsi aktar tard.
I wasn’t after that.	Jien ma kontx wara dan.
I’ve been doing this so far	Qed nagħmel hekk sa issa
I didn’t do anything wrong here	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin hawn
We don't.	M'għandniex.
I want to know what's going on there	Irrid inkun naf x’inhu jiġri hemmhekk
I'm doing it again.	Qed nerġa' nagħmel.
He’s just another bad man.	Huwa biss raġel ħażin ieħor.
I hope you are very happy.	Nispera li tkun kuntent ħafna.
I can say much more	Nista’ ngħid ħafna aktar
It won't be.	Mhux se jkun.
Said you were.	Qal li inti kont.
Nor did he do so.	Lanqas ma għamel hekk.
We have to do the same.	Irridu nagħmlu l-istess.
He could see everything, in fact.	Huwa seta’ jara kollox, fil-fatt.
I want time to think.	Irrid ħin biex naħseb.
I really think it does	Verament naħseb li jagħmel
But how should he know.	Imma kif għandu jkun jaf.
I stand outside and watch	Noqgħod barra u nara
I tell everyone about it	Ngħid lil kulħadd dwarha
How things really are.	Kif verament huma l-affarijiet.
It seems that.	Jidher li .
I knew almost nothing about it	Jien ma kont naf kważi xejn dwarha
I still think things through.	Għadni naħseb l-affarijiet.
But something really was wrong.	Imma xi ħaġa tassew kienet ħażina.
I never wanted anyone else	Qatt ma ridt lil ħadd aktar
I really understand the timing of all this	Verament nifhem iż-żmien ta’ dan kollu
Like, really fun.	Bħal, verament gost.
And we needed that time.	U kellna bżonn dak iż-żmien.
Not so little.	Mhux daqshekk ftit.
When I don't.	Meta jien ma.
Sorry, he says.	Jiddispjaċini, jgħid.
I will think about that	Se naħseb fuq dan
I wasn’t there, anymore	Jien ma kontx hemm, aktar
I just didn’t have the time.	I biss ma kellix il-ħin.
The first one.	L-ewwel waħda.
I want to know these things	Irrid inkun naf dawn l-affarijiet
She is there with him.	Hija hemm miegħu.
I know he will	Naf li se jagħmel dan
He may not be visible, but he is.	Jista’ jkun li ma jidhirx, imma hu.
I did it before.	Għamilt qabel.
I was hoping it would be you	Kont nittama li tkun int
I just didn’t want to be alone	Jien biss ma ridtx inkun waħdi
He was not eating.	Ma kienx jiekol.
I still do.	Għadni nagħmel.
I want to be your friend.	Nixtieq inkun ħabib tiegħek.
No one does that.	Ħadd ma jagħmel dan.
It wasn’t about something like that.	Ma kienx dwar xi ħaġa bħal dik.
And so were we.	U hekk konna aħna.
In fact, of course, there would have been a lot.	Fil-fatt, ovvjament, kien ikun hemm ħafna.
I didn’t want this obviously	Jien ma ridtx dan ovvjament
It was there.	Kien hemm.
It’s too much, of course.	Huwa wisq, ovvjament.
I just don’t know.	Jien biss ma nafx.
This takes a very long time.	Dan jieħu żmien twil ħafna.
Not sure what’s wrong with me.	Mhux ċert x'inhu ħażin miegħi.
Nothing, actually.	Xejn, fil-fatt.
It was a good idea.	Kienet idea tajba.
I think you are ready	Naħseb li inti lest
But soon there will be a problem.	Imma dalwaqt ikun hemm problema.
Everything had happened.	Kollox kien ġara.
I'm back home.	Jien lura d-dar tiegħi.
I know he’s trying now	Naf li qed jipprova issa
If for anyone else you do it for me.	Jekk għal ħadd ieħor tagħmel dan għalija.
It's been a while.	Kien ilu xi żmien.
I couldn’t do it alone	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan waħdi
First I had to think	L-ewwel kelli naħseb
And it certainly wasn’t.	U żgur li ma kienx hekk.
A few hours maybe	Ftit sigħat forsi
He got an idea.	Ħa idea.
This may take some time.	Dan jista 'jkun xi żmien.
He will definitely buy again.	Żgur se jerġa' jixtri.
Great, you think.	Kbir, taħseb.
Now here you are.	Issa hawn int.
I couldn’t wait to see what would happen.	Ma stajtx nistenna biex nara x'se jiġri.
No one else will have to know.	Ħadd ieħor ma jkollu jkun jaf.
It's a big problem.	Hija problema kbira.
I have to be home soon after	Jien għandi nkun id-dar ftit wara
The truth was bad enough.	Il-verità kienet ħażina biżżejjed.
It just wasn’t, it seemed.	Biss ma kinitx, deher.
I see how it goes	Nara kif sejjer
I actually didn’t have anything	Fil-fatt ma kellix xi ħaġa
I never knew anyone	Qatt kont naf lil ħadd
She never did.	Qatt ma għamlet.
And this week, it came out here.	U din il-ġimgħa, ħareġ hawn.
I know you know the truth	Naf li taf il-verità
Not that one.	Mhux dik waħda.
I can’t believe this is happening right now	Ma nistax nemmen li dan qed jiġri bħalissa
I didn’t have more than that	Ma kellix aktar minn hekk
I can tell you it was a job	Nista’ ngħidlek li kien xi xogħol
I don’t think he is	Ma naħsibx li hu
But in fact it was still going on.	Imma fil-fatt kien għadu sejjer.
I wasn’t worried about anything or anyone	Ma kont inkwetat dwar xejn jew xi ħadd
I didn’t think it was going to happen	Ma kontx naħseb li kien se jiġri
He said it will take everyone.	Qal li se jieħu lil kulħadd.
No one seemed to do just one thing.	Ħadd ma deher li jagħmel ħaġa waħda biss.
That was why.	Dan kien għaliex.
You're a big boy.	Int tifel kbir.
Exactly what follows.	Eżatt dak li ġej.
So much fun.	Tant gost.
I had another great teacher	Kelli għalliem kbir ieħor
It was everything to me.	Kienet kollox għalija.
I'm not going to do anything for you	Jien mhu se nagħmel xejn għalik
He never said so.	Qatt ma qal hekk.
He did so.	Hekk għamel.
We have plenty of time for this.	Għandna ħafna ħin għal dan.
Well, not quite.	Ukoll, mhux pjuttost.
They felt good.	Ħassu tajjeb.
It is getting harder and harder.	Qed isir aktar u aktar diffiċli.
I knew it was good	Kont naf li kien tajjeb
I would have been so happy.	Kont inkun daqshekk kuntent.
It’s a good thing for me.	Huwa ħaġa tajba għalija.
I wonder where this comes from	Nistaqsi minn fejn ġej dan
It happens every year.	Jiġri kull sena.
I didn’t know what she looked like	Ma kontx naf kif kienet tidher
I just have to be me	Għandi biss inkun jien
So too.	Hekk ukoll.
This could not happen.	Dan ma setax jiġri.
I hope this was helpful	Nittama li dan kien ta' għajnuna
I can't do that	Ma nistax nagħmel dan
She goes to me for almost everything.	Hija tmur għandi għal kważi kollox.
I will take enough of these	Se nieħu biżżejjed minn dawn
Because it has to be all one way or another.	Għaliex għandu jkun kollu mod jew ieħor.
I couldn't think of that	Ma stajtx naħseb hekk
I'm doing well.	Jien sejjer tajjeb.
We have to do this.	Irridu nagħmlu dan.
I thought we were supposed to be together forever	Ħsibt li suppost konna nkunu flimkien għal dejjem
There is no other way to do it.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor biex tagħmel dan.
That wouldn’t be easy either, he thought.	Dan lanqas ma jkun faċli, ħaseb.
I didn’t want to be here, and he knew it	Ma ridtx inkun hawn, u kien jaf
But she will not eat.	Imma hi mhux se tiekol.
I needed some friends	Kelli bżonn xi ħbieb
I don’t have to think much	M'għandix naħseb ħafna
Maybe too long.	Forsi twil wisq.
I really have to go	I verament ikolli mmur
I was trying to think	Kont qed nipprova naħseb
It may take some time.	Jista' jieħu ftit żmien.
I think he is a good person.	Naħseb li huwa persuna tajba.
I never wanted to stay here	Qatt ma ridt noqgħod hawn
It does exactly the same thing.	Hija tagħmel eżatt l-istess ħaġa.
It’s about being with someone.	Huwa dwar li tkun ma 'xi ħadd.
And it took a long time.	U ħa ħafna ħin.
I had had enough since that first time	Kelli biżżejjed minn dak l-ewwel darba
It’s all about it, really.	Kollox dwarha, tassew.
I can be out there doing something	Nista’ nkun hemm barra nagħmel xi ħaġa
But nothing at the moment.	Imma xejn bħalissa.
But we did it.	Imma għamilna dan.
I just didn’t know how	Jien biss ma kontx naf kif
This was his last chance.	Dan kien l-aħħar ċans tiegħu.
I can't tell you what's right or wrong	Ma nistax ngħidlek x’inhu tajjeb u x’inhu ħażin
I would say so.	Jien ngħid hekk.
I did, and I still do.	Għamilt, u għadni.
We need that.	Għandna bżonn li.
I’m sure he’s good.	Jien ċert li hu tajjeb.
Not all of me.	Mhux jien kollu tiegħi.
I never thought so	Qatt ma kont naħseb hekk
But you are there now.	Imma int qiegħed hemm issa.
And now or never.	U issa jew qatt.
It's a little.	Huwa ftit.
I had a great time.	Kelli ħafna ħin.
I hope it helps	Nispera li jkun ta' xi għajnuna
It will always be yours.	Dejjem se jkun tiegħek.
They felt happy.	Ħassu kuntent.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx.
That is what he said.	Dan huwa dak li qal.
That was good.	Dak kien tajjeb.
I didn’t want to take that much	Ma ridtx nieħu daqshekk
You did what I could.	Int għamilt dak li stajt.
They were often late, and everyone had to wait.	Ħafna drabi kienu tard, u kulħadd kellu jistenna.
It was a great idea.	Kienet idea kbira.
I already knew who he was	Diġà kont naf min kien
I’ve been thinking about this for a long time	Ħsibt dwar dan għal żmien twil
Everything was going to be fine.	Kollox kien se jkun tajjeb.
But he obviously wasn't.	Imma hu ovvjament ma kienx.
You will soon be doing many more things on your own.	Dalwaqt tkun qed tagħmel ħafna aktar affarijiet waħdek.
Obviously you have to be here.	Ovvjament trid tkun hawn.
And it's getting late.	U qed isir tard.
So is mine.	Hekk ukoll tiegħi.
I hope you are not there.	Nispera li ma tkunx hemm.
Not for need.	Mhux għal bżonn.
I have been for a while	Ilni għal ftit żmien
Or so he said.	Jew hekk qal.
For a long time, nothing happens.	Għal żmien twil, ma jiġri xejn.
Where she is.	Fejn hi.
But there are many.	Imma hemm ħafna.
He couldn't see anything.	Ma setax jara xi ħaġa.
He said he wanted one too.	Qal li ried wieħed ukoll.
They seem to have no one else.	Jidher li ma għandhom ħadd ieħor.
I love that you want to do that	Inħobb li trid tagħmel dan
I thought he would be with me forever	Ħsibt li se tkun miegħi għal dejjem
In fact, you can't.	Fil-fatt, ma tistax.
But you can do anything or go where you want.	Imma tista’ tagħmel xi ħaġa jew tmur fejn trid.
We don’t have to.	M'għandniex għalfejn.
I couldn’t know for sure, of course	Ma stajtx inkun naf ċert, ovvjament
It's hard to know for sure.	Huwa diffiċli li tkun taf żgur.
But that is enough for me.	Imma dan huwa biżżejjed għalija.
But there was definitely something about it.	Imma żgur kien hemm xi ħaġa dwarha li.
That was really something.	Dik kienet tassew xi ħaġa.
He doesn’t know much about anything.	Ma jaf ħafna dwar xejn.
I didn't know where it was	Ma kontx naf fejn jista’ jkun
It will be great there.	Se jkun kbir hemmhekk.
It can only be one thing.	Jista 'jkun ħaġa waħda biss.
I’m sure of that too	Jien ċert minn dan ukoll
It is a problem now.	Hija problema ta' issa.
You know nothing.	Inti ma taf xejn.
It takes a while.	Huwa jieħu ftit.
I'm good to go.	Jien tajjeb biex immur.
There is no easy way to do this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod faċli biex tagħmel dan.
I knew something was wrong	Kont naf li xi ħaġa hi ħażina
I was going to stay there	Kont immur noqgħod noqgħod hemm
That’s what I did.	Huwa dak li għamilt.
I can do some time	Kapaċi nagħmel ftit ħin
I had to do something about it	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha
I think maybe he was interested too	Naħseb li forsi kien interessat ukoll
I don’t want that obviously.	Ma rridx dan ovvjament.
I want you to want to be with me	Irrid li tkun trid tkun miegħi
I was more than happy to do so.	Kont aktar minn kuntent li nagħmel hekk.
She was good to me.	Kienet tajba miegħi.
There was currently no need to do this.	Bħalissa ma kienx hemm bżonn li tagħmel dan.
And he was tired.	U kien għajjien.
I will stay here	Jien se noqgħod hawn
I have to try.	Ikolli nipprova.
I want time.	Irrid ħin.
I want that for every child	Irrid dak għal kull tifel
I’m not going to say anything about that, to anyone.	Mhu se ngħid xejn dwar dan, lil ħadd.
I want to do everything.	Irrid nagħmel kollox.
This is not all bad.	Dan mhux kollox ħażin.
Someone was here.	Xi ħadd kien hawn.
But he is good.	Imma hu tajjeb.
I think a lot of people were	Naħseb li ħafna nies kienu
I just wanted to think so	Ridt biss li taħseb hekk
I will do so.	Jien se nagħmel hekk.
I couldn't do that.	Ma stajtx nagħmel hekk.
It went pretty well.	Huwa mar pjuttost tajjeb.
I can say she was a little scared	Nista 'ngħid li kienet ftit jibża'
I was doing the same thing	Jien kont nagħmel l-istess ħaġa
You know it is.	Taf li se.
Something you want to see.	Xi ħaġa li trid tara.
It would be good.	Ikun tajjeb.
I have no idea, man, he said.	M'għandi l-ebda idea, raġel, qal.
I really want to talk to you	Irrid verament nitkellem miegħek
I still have no idea why this happens.	Għadni m'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex jiġri dan.
I was so worried.	Kont tant inkwetat.
I think I did what I had to do	Naħseb li għamilt dak li kellek tagħmel
I have to go now.	Ikolli sejjer issa.
It wasn’t too late.	Ma kontx tard wisq.
Everyone there played.	Kulħadd hemmhekk kellu.
We both knew it was coming.	It-tnejn konna nafu li kien ġej.
I couldn’t be sure what it was.	Ma stajtx inkun ċert x'kien.
He was there, of course.	Huwa kien hemm, ovvjament.
Never, ever was.	Qatt, qatt ma kien.
I wanted to see where he was driving	Ridt nara fejn kien qed isuq
I did and nothing happened.	Għamilt u ma ġara xejn.
I didn’t think so	Jien ma kontx naħseb hekk
He told the truth.	Huwa qal il-verità.
That’s what you’re supposed to do.	Dak hu li suppost tagħmel.
Not until now.	Mhux sa issa biss.
No one knows where he is going.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn sejjer.
They will do almost anything you want.	Huma se jagħmlu kważi kull ħaġa li trid.
Or do you think you are.	Jew taħseb li int.
I can't say what you're thinking	Ma nistax ngħid x'qed taħseb
I'll try later.	Nipprova aktar tard.
I knew this wasn’t going to go well.	Kont naf li dan mhux se jmur tajjeb.
It will be as it was, but better.	Se jkun kif kien, imma aħjar.
I want to do something wrong.	Irrid nagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina.
He didn't look happy.	Ma deherx kuntent.
I shouldn't think so	M'għandix naħseb hekk
I want to know what's going on	Irrid inkun naf x’qed jiġri
I didn’t even know who he was	Lanqas kont naf min kien
Maybe he is, maybe not.	Forsi hu, forsi mhux.
I didn’t want to believe it	Ma ridtx nemmen
He lives here.	Jgħix hawn.
I couldn't tell anyone the truth	Ma stajt ngħid il-verità lil ħadd
You were right about that.	Kellek raġun dwar dan.
From there just above.	Minn hemm biss fuq.
I didn’t want any of this to happen	Ma ridtx li jiġri xejn minn dan
One thought you were a man.	Wieħed ħaseb li inti raġel.
I can talk about this for hours	Nista’ nitkellem għal sigħat dwar dan
I don't need much.	M'għandix bżonn ħafna.
I can’t just go back now.	Ma nistax biss lura issa.
It was so great.	Kien daqshekk kbir.
I thought I was here	Ħsibt li kont qiegħed hawn
He had never done this before.	Huwa qatt ma kien għamel dan qabel.
I had to do something all the time	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa il-ħin kollu
I have someone really interested in buying	Għandi xi ħadd verament interessat li jixtri
I can’t take this anymore	Ma nistax nieħu dan aktar
It seemed to be.	Deher li kien.
I usually never talk to anyone	Normalment qatt ma nitkellem ma’ ħadd
I want you to know that	Irrid li tkun taf dak
I still don’t see anything.	Għadni ma nara xejn.
He wants to go home.	Ikun irid imur id-dar.
He was tired too.	Kien għajjien ukoll.
Nobody is having fun.	Ħadd mhu qed jagħmel gost.
I didn’t know why.	Ma kontx naf għaliex.
And he is the first to do both.	U hu l-ewwel li jagħmel it-tnejn.
And that's what it took.	U dan huwa dak li ħa.
I already.	Jien diġà.
She wasn’t doing it.	Hija ma kinitx tagħmel dan.
He knows where he is going.	Jaf fejn sejjer.
A few years ago.	Ftit snin ilu.
I really thought there would be something	Verament ħsibt li jkun hemm xi ħaġa
I will be either there or here for a while.	Inkun jew hemm jew hawn għal xi żmien.
He didn't expect it to last long.	Ma kienx jistenna li jibqa’ twil.
That will come.	Dak se jiġi.
He must have time.	Għandu jkollu ħin.
I had to do it	Kelli nagħmel dan
I just want an easy morning	Irrid biss filgħodu faċli
And not just once.	U mhux darba biss.
But there is nothing to go by.	Imma m'hemm xejn li jmur minn.
If it appears.	Jekk jidher.
I hope he was just tired.	Nispera li kien biss għajjien.
Maybe she could talk to him about everything that had happened.	Forsi seta’ jitkellem miegħu dwar dak kollu li kien ġara.
I wasn't so happy anymore	Ma kontx daqshekk kuntent aktar
I was wondering if I was okay	Kont qed nistaqsi jekk kontx tajjeb
People he loved.	Nies li kien iħobb.
I love being with one man	Inħobb ħafna, li nkun ma' raġel wieħed
And, there was something else.	U, kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
I had no idea what was going to happen next	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'kien se jiġri wara
I doubt very much if it will happen now	Niddubita ħafna jekk hux se jiġri issa
I can’t tell you how happy I am	Ma nistax ngħidlek kemm ferħan
I did this years ago	Dan għamilt snin ilu
It's about everything.	Huwa dwar kollox.
He was just a small man.	Kien biss raġel żgħir.
I'm glad to see you're good	Jien ferħan nara li int tajjeb
Better stay.	Aħjar toqgħod.
There is a way to do this.	Hemm mod kif tagħmel dan.
That’s all for us today.	Dak kollu għalina llum.
You don’t have to do all this.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel dan kollu.
I need to talk to you about something	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek dwar xi ħaġa
This is where you are tomorrow and we will be here as well.	Dan fejn int għada u aħna nkunu hawn ukoll.
I was hoping you could	Kont nittama li tista’ tiġi
It really really helps.	Huwa verament verament jgħin.
He could have gone there.	Seta’ mort hemm.
And all that great.	U dak kollu kbir.
It's been over a year now	Ilni aktar minn sena issa
He just wanted to get out.	Ried biss barra.
I couldn't understand what was going on	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien qed jiġri
Why don’t you tell me everything that happened.	Għaliex ma tgħidli dak kollu li ġara.
She was alone, so he knew.	Kienet waħedha, hekk kien jaf.
He can play.	Jista' jilgħab.
I just didn’t know how	Jien biss ma kontx naf kif
Had he been there now, he would have expected something later.	Kieku kien hemm issa, kien jistenna xi ħaġa aktar tard.
You will not be here if you do.	Inti ma tkunx hawn jekk inti tagħmel.
I just wanted to.	Ridt biss.
I can't go back as it was	Ma nistax immur lura kif kien
Probably coming soon.	Probabbilment jiġi dalwaqt.
I’m not just saying that.	Jien mhux biss ngħid hekk.
I couldn't understand why	Ma kontx kapaċi nifhem għaliex
I know he didn’t want to	Naf li ma riedx
I'm not too sure about that.	M'inix wisq ċert minn dan.
I don't.	Jien ma.
He wants to go back, but we don’t.	Huwa jrid imur lura, imma aħna le.
I can't go there.	Ma nistax immur hemm.
And never again.	U qatt aktar.
There should be a few more soon.	Għandu jkun hemm ftit aktar dalwaqt.
I was thinking the same thing before it happened	Jien kont naħseb l-istess ħaġa qabel ma ġara
He seemed to have no problem.	Deher li ma kellu l-ebda problema.
I wish she was here right now	Nixtieq li kienet hawn bħalissa
It will not be the same for us.	Mhux se jkun l-istess għalina.
But be back.	Imma jkun lura.
I can only hope you	Nista 'biss nittama li inti
He didn't have to.	Huwa ma kellux.
I didn’t have to ask anything	Ma kelli għalfejn nistaqsi xejn
He couldn’t go today.	Ma setax imur illum.
That was too late, of course.	Dak kien tard wisq, ovvjament.
he said	hu qal
I just got back yesterday	Għadni kif ġejt lura lbieraħ
I wish it was just so.	Nixtieq li kien biss hekk.
I don’t think about it	Jien ma naħseb dwarha
I know what you want	Naf dak li tixtieq
I didn’t know why.	Ma kontx naf għaliex.
It would take a while.	Ikun jieħu ftit.
I have a good friend	Għandi ħabib tajjeb
He said it was because she was here.	Qal li kien għaliex kienet hawn.
No one knew, no one wanted to know.	Ħadd ma kien jaf, ħadd ma ried ikun jaf.
It 's from.	Huwa minn .
He agreed to do the work.	Huwa qabel li jagħmel ix-xogħol.
I need to know everything	Għandi bżonn inkun naf kollox
So it is unlikely to happen.	Hekk mhux probabbli li jiġri.
I’m interested to see more of this	Jien interessat li nara aktar minn dan
By then it looked good.	Sa dak iż-żmien kien jidher tajjeb.
I’m not sure, it happened so fast	M'inix ċert, ġara daqshekk malajr
I had everything ready	Kelli kollox lest
I can’t believe no one helps	Ma nistax nemmen li ħadd ma jgħin
And it obviously won’t do.	U dan ovvjament mhux se jagħmel.
There is no one else here.	M'hemm ħadd ieħor hawn.
They are all the same thing.	Huma kollha l-istess ħaġa.
I think it’s good to tell you.	Naħseb li hu tajjeb li ngħidlek.
I'm ready to hear more	Jien lest li nisma' aktar
They were then and they are now.	Kienu dak iż-żmien u huma issa.
I want to go home.	Nixtieq li jmur id-dar.
I really had nowhere to go	Verament ma kelli fejn immur
He is a big boy.	Huwa tifel kbir.
I get it very wrong	Irrid nifhem ħażin ħafna
I can go a little further	Nista’ mmur għal ftit aktar
he said.	hu qal.
I just wasn’t happy and he knows it	Jien biss ma kontx kuntent u jaf dan
I hope you sit down after that	Nispera li toqgħod bilqiegħda wara dik
I think everyone should know the truth	Naħseb li kulħadd għandu jkun jaf il-verità
This makes everything much easier.	Dan jagħmel kollox ħafna aktar faċli.
That could be something.	Dik xi ħaġa tista’ tkun xi ħaġa.
I have one.	Għandi waħda.
I hope you will	Nispera li tiġi
I'm just surprised.	Jien biss sorpriż.
It's just too late	Għadni biss tard wisq
I know better than to try so far.	Għandi naf aħjar milli nipprova sa issa.
I am no longer a man	M'iniex raġel aktar
And he hadn’t been there before.	U hu ma kienx hemm qabel.
I can’t say what it really is	Ma nistax ngħid x'inhu verament
I don’t know where we’re going to go next	Ma nafx fejn se mmorru wara
This takes a lot of time.	Dan jieħu ħafna ħin.
Whatever you want, it’s yours.	Tkun xi tkun trid, huwa tiegħek.
I was happy with that	Kont ferħan b’dan
I want to go see the house	Irrid immur nara d-dar
She says so.	Hija tgħid hekk.
I believe it will happen	Nemmen li se jiġri
He was right.	Li rajt.
This we have more now than we were.	Dan għandna aktar issa milli konna.
He wanted to, he was there.	Ried, kien hemm.
I probably have for a while.	Probabbilment għandi għal xi żmien.
I want everyone to see this	Irrid li kulħadd jara dan
She can do it now.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan issa.
This is great being your first.	Dan huwa kbir kienu l-ewwel tiegħek.
I'm not a person.	Jien mhux persuna.
I think you know that	Naħseb li taf li
No one else looks exactly like you do.	Ħadd ieħor ma jidher eżatt kif tagħmel int.
I had to be here for him	I kellha tkun hawn għalih
I want to try.	Irrid nipprova.
He said he was not surprised.	Qal li ma kienx sorpriż.
We can do something about it.	Nistgħu nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwar dan.
I want to do it all over again	Irrid nagħmel dan kollu mill-ġdid
I’m so interested.	Jien tant interessat.
I don’t know why this happens.	Ma nafx għalfejn jiġri dan.
Everyone needs to do their own thing	Kulħadd jeħtieġ li jagħmel l-affarijiet tiegħu
I had no idea about all this	Ma kellix idea dwar dan kollu
I buy another if and when the time comes.	Nixtri ieħor jekk u meta jasal iż-żmien.
I want to go back home	Irrid immur lura d-dar
They usually do.	Normalment jagħmlu.
It wasn’t a problem.	Ma kinitx problema.
I need to do a better job	Għandi bżonn nagħmel xogħol aħjar
So far I know what it is.	Sa issa naf x’inhu.
I didn't tell anyone	Lanqas lil ħadd ma qalli
Nobody knew what it was.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x’kien.
Once.	Darba.
But that would be a bit much.	Imma dan ikun daqsxejn ħafna.
I can only hope he is	Nista' biss nittama li hu
You know how it goes.	Taf kif sejjer.
I couldn’t wait for tomorrow	Ma stajtx nistenna għal għada
It probably won’t be much.	Probabbilment mhux se jkun ħafna.
It must be really great	Għandu jkun verament kbir
It's worth thinking about.	Ta’ min jaħseb.
And something else, something else.	U xi ħaġa oħra, xi ħaġa oħra.
That happens so much.	Li jiġri tant.
Who wants to do things.	Li trid tagħmel l-affarijiet.
He knows what's coming.	Hu jaf x’inhu ġej.
Still pretty good.	Għadha pjuttost tajba.
Or rather, as he does not.	Jew aħjar, kif hu ma jagħmilx.
I was your first, and you were mine	Jien kont l-ewwel tiegħek, u int kont tiegħi
It's more about.	Huwa aktar dwar.
Or maybe you are.	Jew forsi int.
I'm thinking.	Qed naħseb.
No one said it looked good.	Ħadd ma qal li deher tajjeb.
I was pretty alone.	Kont pjuttost waħdi.
I have a lot of money	Għandi ħafna flus
Kellha.	Kellha.
There would be other times.	Ikun hemm drabi oħra.
In fact, I was right	Fil-fatt kelli raġun
This is good.	Dan huwa tajjeb.
I was thinking about it	Kont qed naħseb dwarha
This is easy to do.	Dan huwa faċli li tagħmel.
He went again.	Huwa mar mill-ġdid.
Or so he had said.	Jew hekk kien qal.
I wanted all that stuff, too	Jien ridt dak l-affarijiet kollha, ukoll
Maybe yours too.	Forsi tiegħek ukoll.
It can take a very long time.	Jista 'jieħu żmien twil ħafna.
I knew that.	Kont naf li hekk.
I want so much, more than you know	Irrid hekk ħafna, aktar milli taf
I think he didn’t have to	Naħseb li ma kellux għalfejn
I did, but no more	Għamilt, imma mhux aktar
I don’t know exactly where they are.	Ma nafx eżatt fejn huma.
Now he has done so.	Issa hekk għamel.
I suspect he is.	Nissuspetta li hu.
I know you had problems	Naf li kellek problemi
I want to know what you're thinking first	Irrid inkun naf x'qed taħseb qabel
But she knew something was very wrong.	Imma kienet taf li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina ħafna.
I say no more.	Jien ngħid mhux aktar.
','.	','.
I know this is not really happening	Naf li dan mhux qed jiġri tassew
Just like I said.	Eżatt kif għedt.
This happened too quickly.	Dan ġara malajr wisq.
But it’s great.	Imma hu kbir.
I will be fine	Jien se nkun tajjeb
It was there before.	Kien hemm qabel.
All the time.	Il-ħin kollu.
This is how it should look from above.	Dan huwa kif għandu jidher minn fuq.
Everything seems to be fine.	Kollox jidher li hu tajjeb.
I think that would be a good idea	Naħseb li tkun idea tajba
It had happened before.	Kien ġara qabel.
I’m not talking anymore.	Mhux qed nitkellem aktar.
I couldn’t talk about that	Ma stajtx nitkellem fuq dan
I would like to know why	Nixtieq inkun naf għaliex
I'm here if you need anything.	Jien hawn fuq jekk għandek bżonn xi ħaġa.
It works very well.	Jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
I went with a friend	Mort ma’ ħabib
I just try.	Nipprova biss.
I think that’s what he wants.	Naħseb li dak hu li jrid.
Everyone did things.	Kulħadd għamel affarijiet.
I didn’t want to go there	Ma ridtx immur hemm
I have no idea who he is or anything	M'għandi l-ebda idea min hu jew xejn
In fact nothing happens.	Fil-fatt ma jiġri xejn.
I understand better now than ever	Nifhem aħjar issa milli qatt
She was not.	Hija ma kinitx.
Everything had gone wrong.	Kollox kien mar ħażin.
I never knew it would be so good	Qatt ma kont naf li jista’ jkun daqshekk tajjeb
I know you are doing something.	Naf li qed tagħmel xi ħaġa.
No one else knows this.	Ħadd ieħor ma jkun jaf dan.
I think you had time for that	Naħseb li kellek ħin għal dan
I'm not there yet.	Jien għadni m'iniex hemm.
I just need a little more time to think	Għandi bżonn biss ftit aktar ħin biex naħseb
I never thought about it	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwarha
I thought it turned out really well	Ħsibt li ħareġ tassew tajjeb
I want it to take some time.	Irrid li tieħu ftit ħin.
It has never happened before.	Qatt ma ġara qabel.
There is no problem here.	M'hemm l-ebda problema hawn.
I really want to know who he is	Irrid verament inkun naf min hu
I think it’s long enough	Naħseb li huwa twil biżżejjed
I saw you.	Rajt int.
I don't know anything	Jien ma naf xejn
I had no idea how I was going to go about it	Ma kelli l-ebda idea kif se mmur dwarha
He will come otherwise.	Hu se jiġi mod ieħor.
Where you want to be.	Fejn trid tkun.
I didn’t want to talk about it	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwar dan
works very well.	jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
I said nothing and went home	Jien ma għedt xejn u mort id-dar
I have.	Għandi.
I thought it was great.	Ħsibt li kien kbir.
So it must be.	Hekk għandu jkun.
I can't say how long he should live	Ma nistax ngħid kemm għandu jgħix
It looks good.	Jidher li jidher tajjeb.
And better be good.	U aħjar ikun tajjeb.
You want to be here.	Trid li jkun hawn.
I had never seen anyone like this before	Qatt ma kont rajt lil ħadd daqshekk qabel
He lost.	Huwa tilef.
I know for sure	Jien naf li żgur
I had no friends, after all	Ma kellix ħbieb, wara kollox
probably not.	probabbilment le.
He was not coming home.	Ma kienx ġej id-dar.
I have to do everything right again	Ikolli nagħmel kollox tajjeb mill-ġdid
Maybe we do.	Forsi nagħmlu.
You will see things you have never seen before.	Se tara affarijiet li qatt ma rajt qabel.
I know it looks great	Naf li tidher kbira
I didn't want anyone to know anything	Ma ridt li ħadd ikun jaf xejn
That’s where it needs to happen.	Hemmhekk jeħtieġ li jiġri.
It was easier after that.	Kien aktar faċli wara dan.
He still didn’t know exactly how, but he knew it had happened.	Għadu ma kienx jaf eżatt kif, imma kien jaf li kien ġara.
I didn’t like school	L-iskola ma kontx inħobb
I really shouldn't have too much trouble	Verament m'għandix ikolli wisq problemi
Or once there was.	Jew darba kien hemm.
I want to be a boy.	Irrid li tkun tifel.
I’m actually a really great man	Jien fil-fatt raġel tassew kbir
What everyone is doing.	Dak li qed jagħmel kulħadd.
You are here.	Int qiegħed hawn.
I know very little about her	Naf ftit li xejn dwarha
I don't know anymore.	Ma nafx aktar.
So it usually is.	Hekk normalment ikun.
A man came into the room	Raġel daħal fil-kamra
I'm coming with you.	Jien ġej miegħek.
For only a few hours.	Għal ftit sigħat biss.
I wasn’t ready to go back	Ma kontx lest li mmur lura
You know if you are.	Taf jekk int.
I really had to know.	Verament kelli nkun naf.
Nothing more will work.	Xejn aktar se jaħdem.
Many.	Ħafna.
I knew about these things	Kont naf dwar dawn l-affarijiet
He never seemed happy.	Qatt ma deher ferħan.
I don’t do that.	Jien ma nagħmel hekk.
It usually works.	Normalment jaħdem.
Maybe someone else.	Forsi xi ħadd ieħor.
We both know that we need time together.	It-tnejn nafu li għandna bżonn il-ħin flimkien.
I had an afternoon to think about it	Kelli wara nofsinhar biex naħseb dwarha
I wanted to be good.	Ridt inkun tajjeb.
I can do that too.	Jien nista’ nagħmel hekk ukoll.
I was good afterwards	Kont tajjeb wara
You will do that.	Int ser tagħmel dan.
There was something else he wanted.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra li ried.
He will do whatever he wants.	Hu ser jagħmel dak kollu li trid.
I knew it wasn’t really	Kont naf li ma kienx verament
But I can't do that.	Imma ma nistax nagħmel dan.
It’s too early for you.	Għadu kmieni wisq għalik.
It could be good !.	Jista 'jkun tajjeb!.
I heard he was late	Smajt li daħal tard
No one has ever been there.	Ħadd qatt ma ġie hemm.
There is a way to do these things.	Hemm mod kif tagħmel dawn l-affarijiet.
I was good too.	Jien kont tajjeb ukoll.
We can.	Nistgħu .
This has been done and is being done.	Dan sar u qed isir.
I’m too long here.	Jien twil wisq hawn.
I want him to be happy.	Irrid li jkun kuntent.
Not tonight, but soon.	Mhux illejla, imma dalwaqt.
I know.	Naf.
Now better go.	Issa aħjar tmur.
So is everyone.	Hekk hu kulħadd.
There are people sitting here.	Hemm nies bilqiegħda hawn.
Maybe this will happen someday.	Forsi dan jiġri xi darba.
It should be easy enough.	Għandu jkun faċli biżżejjed.
How to do it.	Kif jagħmlu dan.
I was there when this happened	Jien kont hemm meta ġara dan
It's his now.	Huwa tiegħu issa.
The school was mine.	L-iskola kienet tiegħi.
Hi.	Hi.
He was pretty good, too.	Huwa kien pjuttost tajjeb, ukoll.
I thought about it quite a bit.	Ħsibt dwar dan pjuttost ftit.
I really want to be his friend	Irrid verament inkun ħabib tiegħu
I’ve been thinking so for years.	Jien kont naħseb hekk għal snin.
I’m not going to sit here and wait	Jien mhux se noqgħod hawn u nistenna
And it was always the same.	U kien dejjem l-istess.
Unless you can do something.	Sakemm ma tistax tagħmel xi ħaġa.
In fact, you are right.	Fil-fatt, għandek raġun.
I love that dog.	Inħobb dak il-kelb.
I don’t like it a bit	Ma nħobbx xi ftit
There it seems.	Hemm jidher.
That was such a beautiful one.	Dik kienet waħda sabiħa daqshekk.
That works well too.	Li jaħdem tajjeb ukoll.
We can never go back.	Qatt ma nistgħu mmorru lura.
But this was not going to happen.	Imma dan ma kienx se jiġri.
I really don't need another one	Verament m'għandix bżonn ieħor
I want to be with you always	Irrid inkun miegħek dejjem
I do something for him	Jien nagħmel xi ħaġa għalih
That's a pretty good one.	Dik hija waħda pjuttost tajba.
They will not do that.	Huma mhux se jagħmlu dan.
She knew, of course.	Kienet taf, ovvjament.
For that is the only thing you are not.	Għal dik hija l-unika ħaġa li m'intix.
It was so good.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb.
I wasn’t sure what to say or think	Ma kontx ċert x'se ngħid jew naħseb
But there is something you should know.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa li għandek tkun taf.
But he would find out.	Imma kien isir jaf.
No one else here does either.	Ħadd ieħor minn hawn ma jagħmel lanqas.
Really, that’s it.	Tassew, dak hu.
That's really hard.	Dak verament diffiċli.
I saw you around.	Rajt inti madwar.
I may be a little late	Nista’ nkun xi ftit tard
But now she was having fun.	Imma issa kienet qed tieħu gost.
I really need one of these	Għandi bżonn għal kollox wieħed minn dawn
Everything looked good here.	Kollox deher tajjeb hawn.
But one has to be enough.	Imma wieħed ikollu jkun biżżejjed.
I am very interested to know	Jien interessat ħafna li nkun naf
I just want to come back	Nixtieq biss li tiġi lura
That’s not what we do.	Dak mhux dak li nagħmlu.
I spent some time thinking	Għamilt ftit ħin naħseb
But it was much more than that.	Imma kien ħafna aktar minn hekk.
I doubt we will ever know	Niddubita li qatt se nkunu nafu
She knows it’s more than that.	Hija taf li huwa aktar minn hekk.
I really don’t know the problem.	Verament ma nafx il-problema.
Now there is one.	Issa hemm wieħed.
I wanted to stay again.	Ridt noqgħod nerġa.
I want you to know how to do this	Nixtieq li tkun taf kif tagħmel dan
I will not be	Jien mhux se nkun
This was done to me.	Dan sar lili.
It is.	Li se.
There wasn’t much.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna.
He was planning to leave.	Kien qed jippjana li jitlaq.
I was just thinking about work	Kont biss naħseb fuq ix-xogħol
I don't see anything	Jien ma nara xejn
Now you are talking.	Issa qed titkellem.
I need to go see a few things	Għandi bżonn immur nara ftit affarijiet
No, it's not that one.	Le, mhuwiex dak wieħed.
I have to say something.	Ikolli ngħid xi ħaġa.
But it was a little late to know this.	Imma kien ftit tard biex tkun taf dan.
I think we can do that	Naħseb li nistgħu nagħmlu dan
And this is a big problem.	U din hija problema kbira.
I couldn’t do that here	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan hawn
I was too tired for that	Kont għajjien wisq għal dan
It really is.	Huwa tassew.
Why do it.	Għaliex tagħmel dan.
Easy for me.	Faċli għalija.
It could have always been that way for us.	Seta’ dejjem kien hekk għalina.
But he wasn't sure.	Imma ma kienx ċert.
I don't.	Jien ma.
Soon.	Dalwaqt.
A little more to say.	Ftit aktar xi ngħid.
I just know he did	Naf biss li hekk għamel
It won’t help at all.	Mhu se jgħin xejn.
You could have done everything you wanted.	Inti seta 'għamilt dak kollu li ridt.
I hadn’t seen much of anyone	Jien ma kont rajt ħafna lil ħadd
My dog ​​is at home alone.	Il-kelb tiegħi jinsab id-dar waħdu.
Maybe never again.	Forsi qatt aktar.
Any help there ?.	Xi għajnuna hemmhekk?.
It's not that.	Mhuwiex dak.
He must have time.	Għandu jkollu ħin.
That shouldn’t happen, maybe, but it does.	Dan m'għandux jiġri, forsi, imma hekk jiġri.
I wasn’t sure what to do	Ma kontx ċert x'se nagħmel
I would be glad for that	Inkun ferħan għal dan
There is no one.	M'hemm ħadd.
I did these for you	Jien għamilt dawn għalik
I know why I did that	Naf għaliex għamilt dan
But there is only.	Imma hemm biss.
That’s not what happened.	Dak mhux dak li ġara.
Someone was out.	Xi ħadd kien barra.
I didn’t believe that one day	Ma kontx nemmen li xi darba
.	.
I won't even be happy there.	Jien lanqas se nkun kuntent hemmhekk.
There was more to it than that, of course.	Kien hemm aktar minn dan, ovvjament.
I understand.	Jien nifhem.
I don’t need things now.	M'għandix bżonn l-affarijiet issa.
I had to have another	Kelli ikolli ieħor
Or he knows who he is.	Jew jaf min hu.
But he was very tired.	Imma kien għajjien ħafna.
Now you will stand.	Issa int se toqgħod.
If he wasn’t scared, he had to be.	Jekk ma kienx jibża, kellu jkun.
I know you know who he is, what he is.	Naf li taf min hu, x’inhu.
Not like before.	Mhux bħal qabel.
I was, too.	Jien kont, ukoll.
I didn’t do that.	Jien ma kontx nagħmel hekk.
I can tell you someday	Jista’ ngħidlek xi darba
You’re not saying, but it will.	Mhux qed tgħid, imma se.
This was great fun for him.	Dan kien gost kbir għalih.
But she was here now.	Imma hi kienet hawn issa.
Yours can never happen.	Tiegħek qatt ma jista' jiġri.
And no one knows why.	U ħadd ma jaf għaliex.
She was a better person than he knew.	Kienet persuna aħjar minn dik li kien jaf.
I wanted to do something	Ridt nagħmel xi ħaġa
I hope everyone is.	Nispera li kulħadd hu.
And it was, and still is.	U kien, u għadu.
I just happen to have one right here	I biss jiġri li għandi wieħed eżatt hawn
I didn’t know how to do that	Ma kontx naf kif nagħmel dan
I want it to be good.	Irrid li jkun tajjeb.
I wasn't sure what to do next	Ma kontx ċert x’kien hawn biex jagħmel
I want to tell you something.	Irrid ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
That’s unlikely to happen.	Dak mhux probabbli li jiġri.
I didn’t know that.	Jien ma kontx naf dan.
I know what it is.	Naf dak li hu.
I’ve seen this before	Rajt dan qabel
He never had to leave.	Qatt ma kellu telaq.
This was taking too long.	Dan kien qed jieħu wisq żmien.
I could and should have done something	Stajt u kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa
He was wrong.	Kellu ħażin.
I couldn't believe it	Jien ma stajtx nemmen
Okay, me.	Tajjeb, jien.
I didn't know what was going on	Ma kontx naf x’qed jiġri jew x’ġara
It wasn’t that big.	Ma kienx daqshekk kbir.
This can be so, too.	Dan jista 'jkun hekk, ukoll.
It's pretty long.	Huwa pjuttost twil.
It was too much.	Kien wisq.
I was saying it all the time	Jien kont ngħid il-ħin kollu
Early and often.	Kmieni u spiss.
I wish it shouldn’t be so	Nixtieq li ma kellux ikun hekk
Nor was I interested	L-anqas ma kontx interessat
I will never know.	Qatt ma nkun naf.
I'm glad to be here with you	Jien kuntent li nkun hawn miegħek
I'm not going for you.	Jien mhux immur għalik.
And so they are.	U hekk huma.
You did your job.	Int għamilt ix-xogħol tiegħek.
For us, this is it.	Għalina, dan hu.
There is no one.	M'hemm ħadd.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
But how little we know.	Imma kemm nafu ftit.
Who is it?	Min hi?.
Now it’s not something.	Issa mhix xi ħaġa.
You will be glad you came.	Int tkun ferħan li ġejt.
She wasn’t, but he was.	Hija ma kinitx, imma kien.
I will never be again	Jien qatt mhu se nerġa’ nkun
I had no idea I was there	Ma kellix idea li kont hemm
I’m not going to go that far	Mhux se nkun immur daqshekk
I had to sit back	Kelli noqgħod bilqiegħda lura
I didn't listen.	Ma kontx nisma’.
He looked happy with that.	Huwa ħares ferħan b'dan.
I didn’t know otherwise	Ma kontx naf mod ieħor
It was someone else.	Kien xi ħadd ieħor.
He had lost it.	Huwa kien tilef dan.
Without help from anyone.	Mingħajr għajnuna minn ħadd.
I didn’t want to go	Ma ridtx li tmur
This will not happen.	Dan mhux se jiġri.
I have never seen people.	Qatt ma rajt nies.
I will not be alone for long	Mhux se nkun waħdi għal żmien twil
I was nobody.	Jien ma kont ħadd.
But there it was.	Imma kien hemm.
I will be here for you	Jien inkun hawn għalik
You are right, too small.	Għandek raġun, żgħir wisq.
She would never want that.	Hija qatt ma tkun trid hekk.
I would probably do the same thing myself	Probabbilment nagħmel l-istess ħaġa jien
It was easy, he said.	Kien faċli, qal.
I was right all the time	Kelli raġun il-ħin kollu
I recently went home	Dan l-aħħar mort mort id-dar
And it goes.	U jmur.
She.	Hija.
So I heard yesterday	Hekk smajt ilbieraħ
He knows the truth.	Hu jaf il-verità.
I thought it would be easier.	Ħsibt li jkun aktar faċli.
He knew who he was.	Kien jaf min kien.
I had to understand that too	Kelli nifhem ukoll
Tell me what had happened.	Għid dak li kellu ġara.
It was just one kid and it was a lot easier.	Kien tifel wieħed biss u kien ħafna aktar faċli.
She doesn’t want me to stay, she thought.	Hi ma tridx li noqgħod, ħaseb.
It is what we need.	Hi dik li għandna bżonn.
I've seen it happen	Stajt nara li jiġri
This is not so.	Dan mhux hekk.
Nor was he tired.	Lanqas ma kien għajjien.
Neither are we.	Lanqas aħna.
She didn't see anything.	Hija ma kienet tara xejn.
I never thought about it	Jien qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan
I did that that morning	I ma dak filgħodu
I make friends with everyone.	Jien nagħmel ħbieb ma’ kulħadd.
No one has ever done this before.	Ħadd qatt ma għamel dan qabel.
I just need some time.	Għandi bżonn biss ftit ħin.
I was so glad he did	Kont ferħan ħafna li għamel
He did, he said.	Huwa għamel, huwa qal.
I have a lot of fun	Jien nieħu gost ħafna
They were just both of them.	Kienu biss it-tnejn li huma.
We did it one last time.	Għamilna l-aħħar darba.
I could see how much more he had to do	Stajt nara kemm aktar kellu jagħmel
Definitely you should.	Żgur li għandek.
He was not afraid of it.	Ma kienx jibża dwar dan.
It won't be long now.	Ma jkunx twil issa.
It's pretty easy.	Huwa pjuttost faċli.
I want to hear yours	Irrid nisma tiegħek
I really didn’t want that.	Jien verament ma ridtx dan.
Just nothing there.	Biss xejn hemm.
I supposed to.	I suppost li kieku.
This never happened.	Dan qatt ma ġara.
I was happy.	Kont kuntent.
Nor was she home when she left.	Lanqas ma kienet id-dar meta telaq.
I want one.	Irrid wieħed.
I think it might not be helpful	Naħseb li jista 'ma jkunx ta' għajnuna
But he was right.	Imma kellu raġun.
I had to do something more	I kellha tagħmel xi ħaġa aktar
Really a lot.	Tassew ħafna.
I didn’t really need to listen	Ma kellix verament bżonn nisma
But that’s not what you want.	Imma dan mhux dak li trid.
I knew you were never back.	Kont naf li int qatt ma ġejt lura.
Everything was done well.	Kollox sar tajjeb.
Maybe for us.	Forsi għalina.
I can’t really say.	Ma nistax verament ngħid.
I don’t want to be like that anymore.	Ma rridx inkun hekk aktar.
It always goes again.	Dejjem imur mill-ġdid.
It wasn’t and now it never was.	Ma kienx u issa qatt ma kien.
I think maybe you already knew that	Naħseb li forsi kont diġà taf dan
I'm not ready with you	Jien mhux lest miegħek
They felt bad.	Ħassu ħażin.
I'll tell you what's right.	Jien ngħidlek x’inhu tajjeb.
I need to know this	Għandi bżonn li tkun taf dan
I have never seen one before.	Qatt ma rajt waħda qabel.
I really didn’t want to talk to him	Verament ma ridtx nitkellem miegħu
They were very good.	Kienu kienu tajjeb ħafna.
He went home.	Huwa mar id-dar.
We both knew it wasn’t a great idea right now.	It-tnejn konna nafu li ma kinitx idea kbira bħalissa.
It wasn’t what he was expecting.	Ma kienx dak li kien qed jistenna.
No, you shouldn't.	Le, inti m'għandekx.
But you're late.	Imma int tard.
I want to be there when you come back	Irrid inkun hemm meta tiġi lura
I didn’t go alone.	Jien ma mort waħdi.
Did you know they were here.	Kont taf li kienu hawn.
I don’t even have to think about it	Lanqas ikolli għalfejn naħseb dwarha
You were at work.	Inti kont fuq ix-xogħol.
It wasn't mine.	Ma kienx tiegħi.
I couldn’t do that anymore	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan aktar
Outside to eat.	Barra biex tiekol.
Who we were to each other.	Min konna lil xulxin.
I think it was just a while before this happened.	Naħseb li kien biss żmien qabel ma jiġri dan.
I also wonder.	Jien ukoll nistaqsi.
It was too good.	Kien tajjeb wisq.
No, not really.	Le, mhux verament.
And in fact, they do.	U fil-fatt, jagħmlu.
She just wants to go to school	Hija trid biss tmur l-iskola
I knew there were people there	Kont naf li kien hemm nies hemmhekk
You have to be sure.	Għandek tkun żgur.
This may not be what you want.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx dak li trid.
I only do this around the house	Dan nagħmel biss madwar id-dar
But it will.	Imma se.
I think it was too late	Naħseb li kien sa tard
I should have known there was more to it.	I kellha naf li kien hemm aktar għal dan.
I was going to do the same	Kont se nagħmel l-istess
I'm going up.	Jien sejjer sa.
I’m usually out.	Jien normalment barra.
He didn’t know how much he knew little.	Ma kienx jaf kemm kien jaf ftit.
I would just be fine	Inkun biss tajjeb
And it was.	U kien.
We need work.	Għandna bżonn ix-xogħol.
I can’t believe he was going to do that	Ma nistax nemmen li kien se jagħmel hekk
Before leaving.	Qabel ma jitlaq.
You never know.	Qatt ma tkun taf.
I was always going to go back there	Dejjem kont se mmur lura hemm
This is not difficult.	Dan mhux diffiċli.
I think he enjoyed it so much	Naħseb li ħa gost hekk
Too much.	Wisq wisq.
He was very much a man alone.	Kien ħafna raġel waħdu.
He comes back.	Jiġi lura.
I want him to be happy	Irrid li jkun kuntent
I am doing this for you.	Qed nagħmel dan għalik.
I don't even want to	Lanqas nixtieq
I knew he was ready	Kont naf li kien lest
I wanted to hear everything	Ridt nisma’ kollox
That's the first thing.	Dik hija l-ewwel.
I know you can do better.	Naf li tista’ tagħmel aħjar.
You have to do it again.	Għandek tagħmel dan għal darba oħra.
I know someone like that	Naf lil xi ħadd hekk
I see nothing wrong.	Ma nara xejn ħażin.
I couldn't do anything.	Jien ma stajt nagħmel xejn.
It should be as you say.	Għandu jkun kif tgħid.
I would be better off.	Inkun aħjar.
I never had a problem with us alone	Qatt ma kelli problema magħna biss
That's just it.	Hekk hu biss.
I didn’t know she was with you	Ma kontx naf li kienet miegħek
I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you	Jien ma kontx hawn kieku ma kienx għalik
Well, he did.	Ukoll, huwa għamel.
I was good before all this	Kont tajjeb qabel dan kollu
It was, in fact, a bad time.	Kien, fil-fatt, żmien ħażin.
I can hear	Naf nisma’
But so it was.	Imma hekk kien.
He wants to help.	Irid jgħin.
He wants to leave, he was saying.	Irid jitlaq, kien qed jgħid.
I still couldn’t believe this was happening	Għadni ma stajtx nemmen li dan kien qed jiġri
This was going to be difficult.	Dan kien se jkun diffiċli.
No it wasn't.	Le ma kienx.
I hope everyone is fine	Nispera li kulħadd tajjeb
I didn’t know I was coming	Ma kontx naf li ġejt
It wasn’t nearly enough.	Ma kienx kważi biżżejjed.
I needed to do this	Kelli bżonn nagħmel dan
I didn’t know how big it was	Ma kontx naf kemm hu kbir
I'm sure of it	Jiena ċert dwar dan
But it's not working.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem.
I haven’t seen anyone else	Jien ma rajt lil ħadd ieħor
Please do this.	Jekk jogħġbok, tagħmel dan.
I will not do that.	Jien mhux se nagħmel dan.
I love everything he does.	Inħobb dak kollu li jagħmel.
I couldn’t help but love it	Ma stajtx ma nħobbx
He can play.	Jista' jilgħab.
Mine was good.	Tiegħi kien tajjeb.
And he did.	U għamel hekk.
It’s a big, big one.	Hija waħda kbira, kbira.
I didn’t want to wait.	Ma ridtx nistenna.
I have never done anything like this.	Qatt ma għamilt xi ħaġa bħal din.
I hope you did	Nispera li għamilt hekk
I can't.	Ma nistax.
I didn’t want to be there.	Ma ridtx inkun hemm.
I believe, she is the same person	Nemmen, hija l-istess persuna
I think we would be fine.	Naħseb li nkunu tajjeb.
Le dan, le dak.	Le dan, le dak.
I couldn’t do that.	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan.
You go with that.	Inti tmur ma 'dak.
He never had.	Hu qatt ma kellu.
I don't like it.	Jien ma nħobbx.
I want to hear that	Irrid nisma' dak
This does not.	Dan ma.
He had an idea.	Kellu idea.
Not only do you know what happened there.	Mhux biss tkun taf x’ġara hemmhekk.
I knew exactly what he was going to say	Kont naf eżatt x’kien se jgħid
A lot has happened.	Ġara ħafna.
You'll like that, too.	Inti ser bħal dik, ukoll.
I’m sure you already know this	Jien ċert li diġà taf dan
I know how and why this happens	Naf kif u għaliex jiġri dan
It couldn't be.	Ma setax ikun.
It takes time.	Jeħtieġ iż-żmien.
This is not a big deal.	Din mhix xi ħaġa kbira.
As far as I know.	Sa fejn naf jien.
I wasn’t too surprised	Ma kontx sorpriż wisq
I was taking a man	Kont qed nieħu xi raġel
I want to know what happened to me	Irrid inkun naf x’ġara lili
We have tomorrow.	Għandna għada.
This beautiful house.	Din id-dar sabiħa.
I really like doing these.	Inħobb ħafna nagħmel dawn.
Maybe that was the problem.	Forsi dik kienet il-problema.
I need some help.	Għandi bżonn xi għajnuna.
I have to go do something.	Ikolli mmur nagħmel xi ħaġa.
No more.	Mhux aktar.
I was quite surprised	Kont pjuttost sorpriż
I am no longer his friend.	M'iniex aktar ħabib tiegħu.
This is mine.	Din hi tiegħi.
We definitely have a problem.	Żgur li għandna problema.
I want to talk to you now.	Trid nitkellem miegħek issa.
I will never go back.	Qatt ma mmur lura.
He needs help as much as we do.	Huwa għandu bżonn l-għajnuna daqs kemm għandna.
And not just we had.	U mhux biss kellna.
He will be coming back for it.	Huwa se jkun ġej lura għal dan.
I hope he knew that	Jien nittama li kien jaf dan
He didn't even know how to say it.	Lanqas kien jaf jgħid.
But in fact, this is not so.	Imma fil-fatt, dan mhux hekk.
A little more he did.	Ftit ieħor għamel.
We are doing everything we can.	Aħna qed nagħmlu dak kollu li nistgħu.
Often wrong.	Ħafna drabi ħażin.
I know you're a busy man	Naf li int raġel okkupat
Well, you're both right.	Ukoll, int it-tnejn raġun.
It just looked bad.	Deher ħażin biss.
That's too bad.	Dak ħażin wisq.
I need to talk to him	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħu
I still do all that	Għadni nagħmel dak kollu
I was surprised too	Jien kont sorpriż ukoll
It’s hard to go, you know.	Huwa diffiċli li tmur, taf.
I knew exactly what had happened	Kont naf eżatt x’ġara
It seemed to be what they were doing.	Deher li kien dak li kienu qed jagħmlu.
It was all mine.	Kien kollox tiegħi.
Now do so.	Issa jagħmel hekk.
Or something else.	Jew xi ħaġa oħra.
You can do that too.	Tista’ tagħmel dan ukoll.
But he did nothing.	Imma xejn ma għamel.
He seemed as happy as he could be.	Deher li kien ferħan kemm jista’ jkun.
And you know what’s good.	U taf x'inhu tajjeb.
I think he was scared of me	Naħseb li kien jibża minni
I understand how difficult this problem must be for you	Nifhem kemm din il-problema trid tkun diffiċli għalik
I’ve been talking to him.	Jien stajt nitkellem miegħu.
That's what happens.	Hekk jiġri.
I wonder how much he goes for it	Nistaqsi kemm imur għalih
This would be great to see.	Dan ikun kbir biex tara.
To do more.	Biex tagħmel aktar.
Surely it was.	Żgur li kien.
I thought he was dead.	Ħsibt li miet.
And now this is what it is for us.	U issa dan huwa dak li hu għalina.
She is here to stay.	Hija hawn biex toqgħod.
All I knew was that he was	Kont naf biss li kien hu
I will probably see some friends there as well	Probabbilment se nara xi ħbieb hemmhekk ukoll
Everything went well.	Kollox mar tajjeb.
Always be outside what they have.	Dejjem tkun barra dak li għandhom.
He looks tired.	Jidher għajjien.
I have never seen anything done so quickly.	Qatt ma rajt xejn isir daqshekk malajr.
I couldn’t tell for how long	Ma stajtx ngħid għal kemm żmien
He goes alone.	Imur waħdu.
We knew you were coming early.	Konna nafu li ġejt kmieni.
I can do it on my own	Kapaċi nagħmel waħdi
I still believe.	Għadni nemmen.
She wants out.	Hija trid barra.
It has never been so.	Qatt ma kien hekk.
It has always been a problem.	Dejjem kienet problema.
I was not happy	Ma kontx inkun kuntent
So many hours.	Tant sigħat.
I'll talk to you later.	I ser nitkellem miegħek, aktar tard.
It was great.	Kien kbir.
You know how she is.	Taf kif hi.
If not, it probably won't be.	Jekk le, probabbilment mhux se jkun.
I can go back to school	Nista’ mmur lura l-iskola
We know this is likely to happen.	Nafu x'aktarx li se jiġri.
I may be there for a while	Nista’ nkun hemm għal xi żmien
It almost seems that way.	Kważi jidher li hekk.
That's you.	Dak int.
Maybe you want to do the same.	Forsi trid tagħmel l-istess.
I knew what was coming.	Kont naf x’kien ġej.
It's hard to say.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid.
For too many years.	Għal wisq snin.
Maybe he is.	Forsi hu.
I had one once myself	Jien kelli waħda darba jien
It could be work.	Jista 'jkun xogħol.
Very little indeed.	Ftit ħafna tassew.
I just went to think he needed to talk	Jien biss mort naħseb li kellu bżonn jitkellem
I don’t know if it is.	Ma nafx jekk hux.
My friend lives here now	Ħabib tiegħi jgħix hawn issa
She wasn’t the only one.	Ma kinitx l-unika waħda.
I think he is right.	Naħseb li għandu raġun.
Well it’s that time.	Ukoll huwa dak iż-żmien.
It should be everyone.	Għandu jkun kulħadd.
I don’t know why, really.	Ma nafx għaliex, tassew.
I was thinking, if you knew	Kont qed naħseb, kieku taf
But he comes to me.	Imma hu jiġi għandi.
This is a good one.	Din hija waħda tajba.
I want to make mine	Nixtieq nagħmel tiegħi
I may be knowing what it is.	I jista 'jkun naf dak li hu.
That would be enough.	Dan ikun biżżejjed.
I want to be a teacher	Irrid inkun għalliem
I can't tell you anymore	Ma nistax ngħidlek aktar
Many such things have happened	Ġara ħafna affarijiet bħal dawn
I was so busy at work today	Jien kont tant okkupat fuq ix-xogħol illum
You can do that.	Tista' tagħmel dan.
I would like to say the following.	Nixtieq ngħid dan li ġej.
No one else does.	Ħadd ieħor ma jagħmel.
One person who will take a chance.	Persuna waħda li se tieħu ċans.
I didn’t have to do that	Jien ma kellix nagħmel dan
He was not going to do that.	Ma kienx se jagħmel hekk.
But we will be back.	Imma se nkunu lura.
But he could.	Imma seta’.
We have a lot of problems here.	Għandna ħafna problemi hawn.
I knew it wouldn’t be long now	Kont naf li mhux se jkun twil issa
Just that one thing.	Biss dik ħaġa waħda.
More than good.	Aktar minn tajjeb.
I will tell you about this later	I se ngħidlek dwar dan aktar tard
He wanted something completely different.	Ried xi ħaġa oħra għal kollox.
I can do better, I can do better.	Nista’ nagħmel aħjar, inkun aħjar.
I was there alone with no money	Kont hemm waħdi bla flus
I shouldn't have come back	Ma kellix ġejt lura
He would have to do everything tomorrow.	Huwa jkollu jagħmel dak kollu għada.
We are doing something good.	Qed nagħmlu xi ħaġa tajba.
You stay out.	Inti toqgħod barra.
I tell each of his	Jien ngħid lil kull wieħed tiegħu
I will always be with you	Jien dejjem noqgħod miegħek
Most people are currently	Ħafna nies huma bħalissa
It's better than that.	Hija aħjar minn hekk.
I can't really believe it	Ma nistax verament nemmen
I want everyone to know this	Nixtieq li kulħadd ikun jaf dan
I hadn’t thought about it at the time	Jien ma ħsibt xejn dwarha dak iż-żmien
I just hope she’s good	Nispera biss li hi tajba
In fact, you do.	Fil-fatt, inti tagħmel.
I didn't see or hear anything last night	Ma rajt jew smajt xejn ilbieraħ filgħaxija
It takes forever.	Huwa jieħu għal dejjem.
There was nowhere to go.	Ma kienx hemm fejn tmur.
I knew she was a good person	Kont naf li kienet persuna tajba
I really have nothing	Jien tassew m'għandi xejn
Too much for me.	Wisq għalija.
Time always seems to win.	Iż-żmien dejjem jidher li jirbaħ.
I saw a lot of time.	Rajt ħafna ħin.
And he is doing it now.	U qed jagħmel dan issa.
She looks great.	Hija tidher kbira.
Who now knows who he is.	Li issa taf li hu.
I was thinking all that	Kont qed naħseb dak kollu
It's a lot.	Huwa ħafna.
It can't be.	Ma jistax ikun.
The truth was that it wasn’t.	Il-verità kienet li ma kinitx.
He can do it.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel dan.
He can see again.	Jista’ jerġa’ jara.
It was just.	Kien biss.
I want to see this	Irrid nara dan
I'm afraid there's nothing.	Jien nibża’ li m’hemm xejn.
But there were a few.	Imma kien hemm ftit.
Obviously you are not.	Ovvjament m'intix.
It's pretty.	Huwa pjuttost.
I’m the only one who says where she is	Jien l-unika waħda li tgħid fejn hi
You can't be sure.	Ma tistax tkun ċert.
Everything is pretty good.	Kollox huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
I’m not going to say and won’t tell anyone until you do	Jien ma ngħid u mhux se ngħid lil ħadd sakemm tagħmel int
It should be a great time !.	Għandu jkun żmien tajjeb ħafna!.
This is not difficult.	Dan mhux diffiċli.
Anything can happen, and it usually happens.	Kollox jista 'jiġri, u normalment jiġri.
I was surprised like everyone else.	Jien kont sorpriż bħal kulħadd.
He is doing his best.	Qed jagħmel minn kollox.
Or a lot of something.	Jew ħafna minn xi ħaġa.
I want to do things better.	Irrid nagħmel affarijiet aħjar.
It is so.	Huwa hekk.
Earlier this same year.	Aktar kmieni din l-istess sena.
I want to talk to him.	Irrid li titkellem miegħu.
I should have known that he had more than one car	I kellha naf li kellu aktar minn karozza waħda
Just the way you want it.	Eżatt kif trid.
He really does.	Huwa verament jagħmel.
I wish we could.	Nixtieq li nistgħu.
And you said no.	U int għedt le.
I wanted one forever	Jien kont ridt waħda għal dejjem
I only see and hear everything	Nara u nisma’ biss, dak kollu
I want to get back to that	Irrid nerġa' lura għal dak
I was really bad	Kont verament ħażin
And very easy to do.	U faċli ħafna li tagħmel.
Not everyone is like this.	Mhux kulħadd huwa bħal dan.
You do it properly.	Inti tagħmel dan kif suppost.
I never came here	Qatt ma kontx ġej hawn
It's really great.	Huwa tassew kbir.
I believe he was right.	Nemmen li kellu raġun.
But it really isn’t about that.	Imma verament mhux dwar dan.
Let’s one, let’s all.	Ejja wieħed, ejja kollha.
I will not need your help	Mhux ser ikolli bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek
I love being home	Inħobb inkun id-dar
I shouldn’t tell you such things	M'għandix ngħidlek affarijiet bħal dawn
That won’t work.	Dak mhux se jaħdem.
I enjoy being with you	Nieħu gost inkun miegħek
Nothing is right for him.	Xejn mhu tajjeb għalih.
I'll tell you about mine	Jien ngħidlek dwar tiegħi
I thought you wanted to know	Ħsibt li trid tkun taf
I never have to go back	Qatt ma għandi għalfejn immur lura
You have to do a lot of things.	Int għandek tagħmel ħafna affarijiet.
I should be.	I għandu jkun.
I didn’t think I couldn’t, I did.	Jien ma kontx naħseb li ma tistax, jien.
I need to be here with you.	Għandi bżonn inkun hawn miegħek.
I need some more times or something not	Għandi bżonn xi drabi aktar jew xi ħaġa le
A lot of people left.	Telaq ħafna nies.
I think it’s better.	Naħseb li hu aħjar.
I didn’t even think about it.	Lanqas ma ħsibt dwarha.
But not everyone had lost everything.	Imma mhux kulħadd kien tilef kollox.
I haven’t had so much fun	Jien ilni ma nieħu gost daqshekk
And he told everyone about it.	U qal lil kulħadd dwarha.
I knew that, she knew that	Jien kont naf li, hi kienet taf li
We want to do this more than ever now.	Irridu nagħmlu dan aktar minn qatt qabel issa.
I knew there was something wrong	Kont naf li jista’ jkun hemm xejn
I thought he was already gone	Ħsibt li kien diġà mar
He got in there and did things.	Huwa daħal hemmhekk u għamel l-affarijiet.
I want to know how I did it	Irrid inkun naf kif għamilt dan
No one knew where you were.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn int.
I can’t believe it’s working so fast	Ma nistax nemmen li qed jaħdem daqshekk malajr
I’m still trying to figure out why she did it	Għadni qed nipprova nifhem għaliex għamlet hekk
They never were.	Qatt ma kienu.
I was never happy	Jien qatt kont kuntent
My friend works there	Ħabib tiegħi jaħdem hemm
I can't believe you came	Ma nistax nemmen li ġejt
It wasn't working.	Ma kienx qed jaħdem.
I had to do something now	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa issa
I knew he wasn’t going to take this well	Kont naf li ma kienx se jieħu dan tajjeb
I haven’t heard anything back yet	Għadni ma smajt xejn lura
I didn’t need to see anymore.	Ma kellix bżonn nara aktar.
Forever is a long time.	Għal dejjem huwa żmien twil.
I will say so again.	Ħa ngħid hekk mill-ġdid.
I can’t do more for him now	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar għalih issa
I can talk to you sooner	Jien nista' nista' nitkellem miegħek qabel
I’m ready for that.	Jien lest għal dan.
I haven’t seen much lately	Dan l-aħħar ma kontx rajt ħafna
I can't even tell you	Lanqas nista’ ngħidlek
Are they? 	Huma?
I didn't even want to	Lanqas ridt
Why? 	Għaliex?
There were people there.	Kien hemm nies hemmhekk.
I think about it all the time.	Naħseb dwar dan il-ħin kollu.
He looked great.	Huwa deher kbir.
I couldn't understand what was going on	Ma stajtx nifhem x’qed jiġri
I was expecting better	Kont qed nistenna aħjar
I can tell you the truth	Nista’ ngħidlek il-verità
It didn’t have to be.	Ma kellux ikun.
He did everything.	Huwa għamel minn kollox.
She needed more, much more.	Hija kellha bżonn aktar, ħafna aktar.
It's too small.	Huwa żgħir wisq.
It will not always be so.	Mhux dejjem se jkun hekk.
He says he won’t be able to.	Jgħid li mhux se tkun kapaċi.
You can’t stay here much longer.	Ma tistax toqgħod hawn ħafna aktar.
I needed this so much.	Dan kelli tant bżonn.
I’m going to do everything else.	Jien ser nagħmel kull ħaġa oħra.
I have never told anyone about this before	Qatt ma għedt lil ħadd dwar dan qabel
I have never seen anything like it.	Qatt ma rajt xejn bħal dan.
I was always happy alone	Jien dejjem kont kuntent waħdi
And from there.	U minn hemm.
But soon it will be.	Imma dalwaqt se jkun.
Too late for that.	Tard wisq għal dan.
I'm ready for anything	Jien lest għal kull ħaġa li tista’ tiġi
I think it would be so good for you	Naħseb li jkun daqshekk tajjeb għalik
Well, actually it is.	Ukoll, fil-fatt huwa.
I was never the same after that	Qatt ma kont l-istess wara dak
Nothing seemed to work for me.	Xejn ma deher li jaħdem għalija.
That’s good, of course.	Dak tajjeb, ovvjament.
I wasn’t expecting any of this to happen	Ma kont qed nistenna li jiġri xejn minn dan
But there is nothing we can do about it now.	Imma m'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu dwar dan issa.
Not very long.	Mhux twil ħafna.
Better be there too.	Aħjar tkun hemm ukoll.
Obviously she does.	Ovvjament hi tagħmel.
It's time.	Wasal iż-żmien.
He’s like a boy, he’s so happy.	Huwa bħal tifel, huwa tant kuntent.
I wasn't like that	Jien ma kontx inkun hekk
In time.	Fi żmien.
I know a lot about it, but definitely not everything	Naf ħafna dwarha, imma żgur mhux kollox
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
He will definitely live with us.	Żgur li se jgħix magħna.
I want to think about this for a while	Irrid naħseb dwar dan għal ftit żmien
I really hope you are right	Verament nittama li għandek raġun
I really wish you hadn't told me that	Nixtieq tassew li ma kontx qalli hekk
That you can do something like that.	Li inti tista 'tagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I don't want that to happen.	Ma rridx li jiġri hekk.
You can't go home.	Ma tistax tmur id-dar.
She is a beautiful person.	Hija persuna sabiħa.
A person can only take so much	Persuna tista' tieħu daqshekk biss
I hope it helps.	Nittama li jgħin.
You know that could be good for me.	Taf li dan jista’ jkun tajjeb għalija.
I wasn't happy anymore	Ma kontx kuntent aktar
I haven’t been here before	Jien ma kontx hawn qabel
That was never me.	Dak qatt ma kont jien.
I can’t think about it now	Ma nistax naħseb dwarha issa
Everyone was gone.	Kulħadd kien mar.
I wonder when this happened	Nistaqsi meta ġara dan
I go with all of the above	Immur ma 'dak kollu ta' hawn fuq
For then and for now only.	Għal dak iż-żmien u għal issa biss.
I think, but whatever	Naħseb, imma tkun xi tkun
In fact, that would be a good thing.	Fil-fatt, dik tkun ħaġa tajba.
I'll try this.	Jien ser nipprova dan.
I had to be there	I kellha tkun hemm
I can’t wait for that	Ma nistax nistenna hekk
I was always going to be	Jien dejjem kont se nkun
I've been thinking about it for a long time	Ilni naħseb dwarha
I didn’t really want to know.	Ma tantx ridt inkun naf.
He didn’t have to do that.	Ma kellux għalfejn jagħmel hekk.
I didn’t know anything about it until after it happened	Ma kont naf xejn dwarha sa wara li ġara
I was not interested in making friends with anyone	Ma kontx interessat li nagħmel ħbieb ma’ ħadd
The house too.	Id-dar ukoll.
Come on come on come on.	Ejja ejja ejja ejja.
He was not happy.	Ma kienx kuntent.
As it happened.	Kif ġara.
that evening.	dik il-lejla.
I will never go back.	Jien qatt mhu se mmur lura.
There is time for this later.	Hemm żmien għal dan aktar tard.
I know you didn’t want to come here but you should.	Naf li ma ridtx tiġi hawn imma għandek.
I know it will.	Naf li se.
Look at my house.	Ħares lejn id-dar tiegħi.
I should have done a better job	I kellha għamilt xogħol aħjar
One has to eat.	Wieħed irid jiekol.
Well, maybe a little.	Ukoll, forsi ftit.
It's something anyone can do.	Hija xi ħaġa li kulħadd jista 'jagħmel.
This was not the case.	Dan ma kienx.
I’m so glad you came along when I did	Jien ferħan ħafna li ġejt flimkien meta għamilt
It never was, and never will be.	Qatt ma kien, u qatt mhu se jkun.
Don’t do anything else.	M'għandekx tagħmel xejn aktar.
I’m not sure anyone does.	M'inix ċert li xi ħadd jagħmel.
I will do the same.	Jien se nagħmel l-istess.
It must be.	Irid ikun.
I want everyone back	Irrid lil kulħadd lura
I thought so too.	Ħsibt hekk ukoll.
But it didn't look right.	Imma ma deherx tajjeb.
I do something for you, you do something for me	Jien nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik, inti tagħmel xi ħaġa għalija
I will not do anything like that again.	Mhux se nerġa’ nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik.
Just about everyone has a car.	Biss madwar kulħadd għandu karozza.
Maybe he already had.	Forsi diġà kellu.
I don’t know why it wasn’t.	Ma nafx għaliex ma kienx.
I didn’t want to do that	Jien ma ridtx nagħmel hekk
I didn’t want to be late.	Ma ridtx inkun tard.
Today she did.	Illum għamlet.
I have no problem not knowing	M'għandi l-ebda problema li ma nafx
He was right of course.	Kellu raġun ovvjament.
I could see what was going on here	Stajt nara x’kien qed jiġri hawn
I need a lot of time alone	Għandi bżonn ħafna ħin waħdi
He didn't.	Huwa ma.
I went, but only for a little while.	Mort, imma għal ftit biss.
I shouldn't have listened to my friend	Ma kellix nisma’ lil ħabib tiegħi
There is much more.	Hemm ħafna aktar.
Usually she's on top of things.	Normalment hi hekk fuq l-affarijiet.
Not yesterday, not tomorrow, but today.	Mhux il-bieraħ, mhux għada, imma llum.
I don't need that.	M'għandix bżonn dak.
And it's hard.	U huwa diffiċli.
I can't do it anymore	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar
I didn’t know, you see	Ma kontx naf, tara
Just that, nothing more.	Biss dak, xejn aktar.
Time was money.	Iż-żmien kien flus.
That’s great too.	Dak hu kbir ukoll.
No one said it was	Ħadd ma qal li kien hekk
I want something	Irrid xi ħaġa
I couldn't ask	Ma stajtx nistaqsi
I haven't been out in a long time	Ilni ma kont ilni barra
Pretty nice one.	Waħda pjuttost sabiħa.
It's more than enough.	Huwa aktar minn biżżejjed.
I will have to try this some time.	Ikolli nipprova dan xi żmien.
I can do this if you want	Jien nista' nagħmel dan jekk trid
He had done what he could.	Huwa kien għamel li seta.
I couldn’t believe how good they felt	Ma stajtx nemmen kemm ħassu tajjeb
She was definitely not going to say anything.	Żgur li ma kienet se tgħid xejn.
I didn’t want to, really	Ma ridtx, tassew
It will take time for this.	Ikun bżonn iż-żmien għal dan.
I knew it was good.	Kont naf li kien tajjeb.
We need that.	Għandna bżonn dan.
More on that, he said.	Aktar dwar dan, huwa qal.
That should do it.	Dan għandu jagħmel.
He was still eating.	Kien għadu jiekol.
I didn't say anything.	Jien ma għedt xejn.
She thinks not.	Hi taħseb li le.
I wasn’t too sure why	Ma kontx wisq ċert għaliex
I could be more of someone.	I jista 'jkun aktar ta' xi ħadd.
Probably too.	Probabbilment wisq.
I heard and thought	Smajt u ħsibt
You can't even say anything.	Tista’ lanqas tgħid xejn.
And that was a year ago.	U dan kien sena ilu.
I've never been on one before.	Qatt ma kont fuq waħda qabel.
I need to understand that	Għandi bżonn nifhem dan
I wonder where that came from	Nistaqsi minn fejn ġie dak
I hardly knew who he was	Ma tantx kont naf min kien
I never was.	Jien qatt ma kont.
That says something	Li tgħid xi ħaġa
People you know.	Nies li taf.
I really need to talk to you.	Għandi verament bżonn nitkellem miegħek.
Back to top.	Lura għal fuq.
I was pretty scared	Jien kont nibża’ pjuttost
But there was nothing more.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn aktar.
But he couldn’t do it.	Imma ma setax jagħmel dan.
If he left.	Jekk telaq.
It was he who did it.	Kien hu li jagħmel dan.
I have no problem with that now	M'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan issa
I definitely wasn’t having any more	Żgur ma kontx qed ikolli aktar
I like to say so	Inħobb ngħid hekk
You are eating.	Qed tiekol.
He should never have come here.	Qatt ma kellu jasal hawn.
Which is good.	Li huwa tajjeb.
I think you are right.	Naħseb li għandek raġun.
And that was it.	U kien dan.
I knew this was my only chance	Kont naf li dan kien l-unika ċans tiegħi
I needed to know more	Kelli bżonn inkun naf aktar
For someone else, it may not be.	Għal xi ħadd ieħor, jista 'ma jkunx.
Many of my friends are	Ħafna ħbieb tiegħi huma
For me it comes and goes.	Għalija tiġi u tmur.
No one is talking.	Ħadd mhu qed jitkellem.
I need to understand something else	Għandi bżonn nifhem xi ħaġa oħra
No, he said.	Le, qal.
That was never his problem.	Dik qatt ma kienet il-problema tiegħu.
You know more than you say.	Taf aktar milli qed tgħid.
This has been a difficult year for us.	Din kienet sena diffiċli għalina.
But it happened long before and after.	Imma ġara ħafna qabel u wara.
I want you to come now	Irrid li tiġi issa
I have to be home soon after.	Jien għandi nkun id-dar ftit wara.
This is your first time.	Din hija l-ewwel darba tiegħek.
And that he didn’t want to.	U li ma riedx.
I didn’t even think about it you know	Lanqas kont naħseb dwarha taf
I am not a child anymore.	M'iniex tifel aktar.
I had no idea why it might be	Ma kelli l-ebda idea għaliex jista 'jkun
I can’t do what I once was	Ma nistax nagħmel dak li kont darba
I need more than that	Għandi bżonn aktar minn hekk
As much as possible.	Bħal kemm jista’ jkun.
Why would she.	Għaliex kieku hi.
She really did.	Hija tassew għamlet.
But so it had to be.	Imma hekk kellu jkun.
I’m not doing that.	Jien mhux qed nagħmel dan.
He seemed so happy.	Huwa deher hekk kuntent.
I can’t be happier	Ma nistax inkun aktar ferħan
In no time.	Fi ftit żmien.
You can’t tell me to do anything.	Ma tistax tgħidli nagħmel xejn.
About home.	Dwar id-dar.
He never had, he never will.	Qatt ma kellu, qatt mhu se.
It’s good, he said.	Huwa tajjeb, huwa qal.
I hope it was good for you too	Nispera li kien tajjeb għalik ukoll
I never thought much about it	Qatt ma ħsibt ħafna dwarha
I had to be on it	I kellha tkun fuq dan
.	.
Everything now.	Kollox issa.
Maybe he wanted to.	Forsi ried.
So do you.	Hekk tagħmel dan.
But it didn’t do much for you.	Imma ma tantx għamlet għalik.
There was nothing he could do to make up for it.	Ma kien xejn li seta’ jagħmel biex jagħmel tajjeb għal dan.
I want everything to go away	Irrid li kollox jitlaq
I had no idea who he was.	Ma kellix idea min kien.
I thought he knew better	Ħsibt li kien jaf aħjar
I wasn’t sure why we were here	Ma kontx ċert għaliex konna hawn
I can't understand how to do that.	Ma nistax nifhem kif nagħmel dan.
And he.	U hu.
You know, of course.	Taf, ovvjament.
You really are supposed to talk to him.	Int verament suppost titkellem miegħu.
I heard a little to be sure	Smajt ftit biex inkun ċert
Where she was last night.	Fejn kienet ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
He wouldn’t need the car for hours.	Ma kienx ikollu bżonn il-karozza għal sigħat.
It could be both.	Jista 'jkun it-tnejn.
No, not even that.	Le, lanqas dik.
Everyone probably does.	Kulħadd probabbilment jagħmel dan.
I have a friend who lives there	Għandi ħabib li jgħix hemm
I didn’t believe that for a long time.	Ma kontx nemmen li għal żmien twil.
I have a good time	Għandi żmien mhux ħażin
I need to talk to you now	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek issa
There it was, there it was.	Kien hemm, kien hemm.
I thought that for years.	Ħsibt li għal snin.
We have no idea how long it will take.	Bħalissa m’għandniex idea kemm se jasal.
If not, try something else.	Jekk le, ipprova xi ħaġa oħra.
Or it has been until now.	Jew kien sa issa.
But of course it can.	Imma ovvjament jista’.
I speak without thinking	Nitkellem mingħajr ma naħseb
Well, good for him.	Ukoll, tajjeb għalih.
I'm so scared.	Jien tant jibża.
You too maybe.	Int ukoll forsi.
After that not.	Wara dan mhux.
And you stay.	U inti toqgħod.
I want yours too	Jiena nixtieq ukoll tiegħek
I think she probably knew why	Naħseb li probabbilment kienet taf għaliex
It could just be.	Jista 'jkun biss.
I think this is a good thing	Naħseb li din hija ħaġa tajba
We are doing the same thing.	Aħna qed nagħmlu l-istess ħaġa.
It should be morning again.	Għandu jerġa’ jkun filgħodu.
Or later.	Jew aktar tard.
I’m not telling anyone I’ve been here	Jien ma ngħid lil ħadd li kont hawn
I need to go with you	Għandi bżonn immur miegħek
And they are easy.	U huma faċli.
Until he.	Sakemm hu.
It looked good to him.	Deher tajjeb għalih.
She had to know.	Kellha tkun taf.
I wasn’t really sure when that had happened	Ma kontx verament ċert meta dan kien ġara
Now I think we are better than each other	Issa naħseb li nkunu aħjar minn xulxin
That currently, she obviously wasn’t.	Li bħalissa, hi ovvjament ma kienx.
I know more than he thinks	Naf aktar milli jaħseb hu
I just thought about it, and it happened	Ħsibt biss dwarha, u ġara
Not everyone needs to be your friend.	Mhux kulħadd jeħtieġ li jkun ħabib tiegħek.
In the long run.	Fuq żmien twil.
I never stay here for long together.	Jien qatt ma noqgħod hawn għal żmien twil flimkien.
But obviously it wasn’t.	Imma ovvjament ma kinitx.
I was a teacher, you know.	Kont inkun għalliem, taf.
I think you will be fine here	Naħseb li inti tkun tajjeb hawn
You're the problem.	Int il-problema.
And he was alone.	U kien waħdu.
This works well, really, really well.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb, tassew, tassew tajjeb.
I just want to eat more	Nixtieq biss li jiekol aktar
It was nothing he knew too well.	Kien xejn li kien jaf wisq tajjeb.
But not so difficult.	Imma mhux daqshekk diffiċli.
It becomes difficult to speak.	Isir diffiċli biex titkellem.
It was going to be hard for a while.	Kien se jkun diffiċli għal xi żmien.
Something to do.	Xi ħaġa li tagħmel.
Now I couldn't see or hear	Issa ma stajtx nara jew nisma’
she says.	hi tgħid.
Definitely me	Żgur li jien
She would come to me there.	Kienet tiġi għandi hemmhekk.
It's good.	Huwa tajjeb.
That's just the way they are.	Hekk huma biss.
Just to survive.	Biss biex jgħix.
But it is not working.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem.
You are not too busy.	M'intix wisq okkupat.
But not me.	Imma mhux jien.
Not sure how much.	Mhuwiex ċert kemm.
Everything was great.	Kollox kien kbir.
I'm pretty good.	Jien pjuttost tajjeb.
I hope soon.	Nittama li dalwaqt.
I can do everything right	Kapaċi nagħmel kollox tajjeb
Like this.	Bħal dan.
I'm definitely out.	Jien żgur barra.
Maybe you can but it's not for me.	Forsi tista’ imma dan mhux għalija.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
He never said much.	Qatt ma qal ħafna.
All this was a long time ago.	Dan kollu kien twil ilu.
In addition.	Barra minn hekk.
In fact, he must have done it.	Fil-fatt, huwa għandu jkun għamel.
I thought you would be.	Ħsibt li inti tkun.
I knew who she really was	Kont naf min kienet tassew
I had no idea about that	Ma kelli l-ebda idea dwar dan
This is our first.	Dan huwa l-ewwel tagħna.
I think we will go home soon	Naħseb li se mmorru d-dar dalwaqt
I had no friends to talk to	Ma kelli l-ebda ħbieb biex nitkellem
He doesn’t even look too good.	Hu lanqas jidher tajjeb wisq.
I couldn't see why he couldn't stay	Ma stajtx nara għaliex ma setax jibqa' aktar
No one is here.	Ħadd mhu hawn.
I know who you're talking about	Naf dwar min titkellem
You see, it was always you.	Tara, dejjem kont int.
I know you are not a bad boy	Naf li m'intix tifel ħażin
I can't understand what I'm doing wrong.	Ma nistax nifhem x'qed nagħmel ħażin.
I was not surprised	Ma kontx kont sorpriż
Other times, it’s not.	Drabi oħra, mhuwiex.
It was early afternoon.	Kien kmieni wara nofsinhar.
It's pretty big.	Huwa pjuttost kbir.
He knew he could.	Kien jaf li jista’.
I have no idea where it comes from	M'għandi l-ebda idea minn fejn ġej
So is everyone.	Hekk hu kulħadd.
He wants to know.	Irid ikun jaf.
I see everyone and how they do things	Nara lil kulħadd u kif jagħmlu l-affarijiet
I don’t like when you do that	Jien ma nħobbx meta tagħmel dan
She doesn’t just want to make money.	Hija ma tridx biss tagħmel flus.
It would be my last.	Ikun l-aħħar tiegħi.
I thought we could go back to yesterday	Ħsibt li nistgħu mmorru lura qabel ilbieraħ
I didn't even know it at the time	Dak iż-żmien lanqas kont naf
I will buy everything.	Jien se nixtri kollox.
I was not able to be there	Ma kontx kapaċi nkun hemm
I can’t say for sure now	Ma nistax ngħid żgur issa
This could not be.	Dan ma setax ikun.
Now I knew this was mine	Issa kont naf li dan kien tiegħi
But this could not be.	Imma dan ma setax ikun.
I couldn’t do it anymore.	Ma stajtx nagħmel aktar.
I know that’s not what you want	Naf li mhuwiex dak li tixtieq
That's right.	Hekk hu.
Or this week.	Jew din il-ġimgħa.
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Imma m'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu dwar dan.
He was more like a man than a boy.	Kien aktar bħal raġel milli tifel.
I think it's a good idea	Naħseb li hija idea tajba
This we are.	Dan aħna.
We spent more time there.	Għamilna aktar ħin hemmhekk.
I know I was with him	Naf li kont miegħu
We knew this quite early on.	Dan konna nafu pjuttost kmieni.
I don’t want to go back, he said	Ma rridx immur lura, qal
I'm nobody.	Jien ħadd.
Let’s think about it.	Ejja naħseb dwarha.
I have to say I did a lot of work	Irrid ngħid li għamilt ħafna xogħol
I really don’t want to talk about it	Verament ma rridx nitkellem dwar dan
Tonight if you can.	Illejla jekk tista'.
I was doing something wrong	Kont qed nagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina
I wanted to go to him so much	Jien tant ridt immur għandu
I hope this helps.	Nittama li dan jgħin.
As he is.	Kif hu.
I didn't know exactly what it was	Ma kontx naf eżatt x’kien
I have been for a very long time	Ilni għal żmien twil ħafna
I’m just trying to understand	Jien biss nipprova nifhem
I don’t think it’s the same now.	Ma naħsibx li huwa l-istess issa.
No one was very surprised.	Ħadd ma kien sorpriż ħafna.
It can happen.	Huwa jista 'jiġri.
Maybe that's how it is.	Forsi hekk huwa kif dan.
I never thought about it, but probably	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha, imma probabbilment
It was the last.	Kien l-aħħar.
It’s time to go.	Wasal iż-żmien li mmur.
And that was good.	U dan kien tajjeb.
I hope it still works.	Nispera li għadu jaħdem.
He is a child only.	Huwa tifel biss.
We have to do this.	Irridu nagħmlu dan.
You would not want to do that.	Inti ma tkunx trid tagħmel dan.
I didn’t expect that to happen	Ma kontx nistenna li jiġri hekk
I can hear something	Nista’ nisma’ xi ħaġa
Yours was great.	Tiegħek kien kbir.
That is so much.	Dan huwa tant.
Nothing more happens.	M'hemm xejn aktar jiġri.
Come now, please.	Tiġi issa, jekk jogħġbok.
It took a good while.	Ħa ftit żmien tajjeb.
And that.	U dak.
She had enough to think about right now.	Kellha biżżejjed biex taħseb dwarha bħalissa.
We didn’t know any of these things.	Ma konna nafu xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet.
I didn't want to go back	Ma ridtx nerġa’ lura
He was thrilled.	Kien ferħan ferħan.
I just didn’t want to	Jien biss ma ridtx
It won’t work and it can’t work.	Mhux se jaħdem u ma jistax jaħdem.
I understand if you want me to go	Nifhem jekk tixtieq li mmur
I hope someone knows what to do	Nispera li xi ħadd ikun jaf x'għandu jagħmel
Well, there was never a time, really.	Ukoll, qatt ma kien hemm ħin, tassew.
It can't even be good.	Jista’ lanqas ikun tajjeb.
I couldn’t take it anymore	Ma stajtx nieħu aktar
There was just that.	Kien hemm biss dan.
He said nothing.	Ma qal xejn.
I was so scared and tired.	Kont tant jibża u għajjien.
But there really is no right or wrong.	Imma verament m'hemm l-ebda tajjeb jew ħażin.
I love him	Jien inħobb miegħu
More than that.	Aktar minn hekk.
I didn't go back.	Jien ma mort lura.
It’s not good to talk like that.	Mhux tajjeb li titkellem hekk.
Nothing like that actually happened, of course.	Fil-fatt ma ġara xejn bħal dan, ovvjament.
I'm not going.	Jien mhux sejjer.
But he will never appear.	Imma hu qatt mhu se jidher.
It was pretty big.	Kien kbir pjuttost.
He had a big problem.	Kellu problema kbira.
Here's one.	Hawn wieħed.
I saw what he wanted.	Rajt dak li ried.
She wouldn’t tell me where she was.	Ma kinitx tgħidli fejn kienet.
No one is talking about it.	Ħadd mhu qed jitkellem dwar dan.
I wasn’t going with him	Jien ma kontx sejjer miegħu
You don’t need much to be happy.	M'għandekx bżonn ħafna biex tkun kuntent.
I didn't have to say that	Ma kellix ngħid daqshekk
I had thought the same thing before	Jien kont ħsibt l-istess qabel
Or something like that.	Jew xi ħaġa bħal din.
Everything was coming back.	Kollox kien ġej lura.
But you’re so much more than that.	Imma int ħafna aktar minn hekk.
You do what you will do well.	Int tagħmel dak li se tagħmel tajjeb.
No, it really is.	Le, tassew hu.
In fact, they are one.	Fil-fatt, huma wieħed.
It will be a great thing.	Se tkun ħaġa kbira.
Everything was as it should be.	Kollox kien kif suppost.
She was on me once.	Hija kienet fuq lili darba.
We did these.	Għamilna dawn.
I can tell you about it later, if you like	Nista 'ngħidlek dwar dan aktar tard, jekk tixtieq
I try so.	Jien nipprova hekk.
I wanted to eat one.	Ridt niekol wieħed.
This will not happen.	Dan mhux se jiġri.
And there will be more.	U se jkun hemm aktar.
We had had enough of this.	Kellna biżżejjed minn dan.
Not sure if he will do it.	Mhux ċert jekk hux se jagħmel dan.
And he didn’t know what to do anymore.	U ma kienx jaf x'għandu jagħmel aktar.
I believe he is up to no good	Nemmen li hu sa xejn tajjeb
And it can be the same.	U tista’ tkun l-istess.
I don’t know how to say this.	Ma nafx kif ngħid dan.
I'm talking to you.	Jien nitkellem miegħek.
I hope it works for you.	Nittama li jaħdem għalik.
You’re not ready to think about it yet.	Għadek m'intix lest biex taħseb dwarha.
She had nothing to say.	Hija ma kellha xejn xi tgħid.
But she did now.	Imma hi għamlet issa.
I will go here alone	Jien se mmur waħdi minn hawn
And a beautiful evening there.	U filgħaxija sabiħa hemmhekk.
Now that’s something.	Issa dik hija xi ħaġa.
I wasn’t there enough.	Jien ma kontx hemm biżżejjed.
That's what he wants.	Dak hu jrid.
For.	Għal.
I won't be here either	Lanqas se nkun hawn
Or so you might think.	Jew hekk tista 'taħseb.
She really is.	Hi tassew.
He is right about that.	Huwa għandu raġun dwar dan.
And so he did.	U hekk għamel.
Something to think about.	Xi ħaġa li taħseb dwarha.
No one knew where they were.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn kienu.
I never thought I would	Qatt ma naħseb li nagħmel hekk
I didn’t know for sure	Ma kontx naf ċert
But you are one.	Imma int wieħed.
Nothing.	Xejn.
I was listening.	Kont nisma’.
Maybe one day it was.	Forsi xi darba kienet.
He knew his things.	Kien jaf l-affarijiet tiegħu.
No one needs to be surprised.	Ħadd ma jeħtieġ li jkun sorpriż.
Maybe that helps	Forsi dan jgħin
I know he didn’t, but he did	Naf li ma kellux, imma hekk għamel
It was too early.	Kien wisq kmieni.
You really weren’t there.	Int verament ma kontx hemm.
Well, that's it.	Ukoll, dak hu.
There is something here for everyone.	Hemm xi ħaġa hawn għal kulħadd.
I wasn’t sure about that	Ma kontx ċert dwar dan
Not a chance.	Mhux ċans.
Something was wrong, very wrong.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina, ħażina ħafna.
That's a problem.	Dik hija problema.
No one said too much.	Ħadd ma qal wisq.
He loved someone once.	Kien iħobb lil xi ħadd darba.
It would be great.	Ikun tajjeb ħafna.
This was going to work.	Dan kien se jaħdem.
I was glad he went through that.	Kien ferħan li għadda minn hekk.
I wanted to know everything about her	Ridt inkun naf kollox dwarha
I really wanted to see how they felt	Verament ridt nara kif ħassu
I was just another man	Kont biss raġel ieħor
I didn’t know anything was happening	Ma kontx naf li kien qed jiġri xejn
They are really on to something here.	Huma verament fuq xi ħaġa hawn.
You have the following.	Għandek li ġej.
There is nothing for that now.	M'hemm xejn għal dak issa.
I thought it was too small	Ħsibt li kien żgħir wisq
I need you to be here	Għandi bżonn li inti tkun hawn
I'm here for you now	Jien hawn għalik issa
He said he needed to eat.	Qal li kellu bżonn jiekol.
I was no better than they were	Jien ma kontx aħjar milli kienu
I expect someone else to do the same	Nistenna li xi ħadd ieħor jagħmel l-istess
I wanted to be out more than anything	Ridt li jkun barra aktar minn kull ħaġa
This as it should be.	Dan kif għandu jkun.
One never leaves.	Wieħed qatt ma jitlaq.
It will never be the same.	Qatt mhu se tkun l-istess.
He said he was trying to come.	Qal li jipprova jiġi.
Not that, nothing.	Mhu dak, xejn.
I will always be here	Jien dejjem inkun hawn
I have to be there for that	Għandi nkun hemm għal dan
It doesn’t have to be one or the other.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun wieħed jew ieħor.
It's really that easy.	Huwa verament daqshekk faċli.
Everyone is really easy.	Kulħadd huwa verament faċli.
I had never been here	Qatt ma kelli ġejt hawn
Its time has come.	Wasal iż-żmien tiegħu.
You can see that they have this very wrong.	Tista 'tara li għandhom dan ħażin ħafna.
I really wanted to see what you have	Verament ridt nara dak li għandek
And there’s a chance there’s more to where that came from.	U hemm ċans li jkun hemm aktar minn fejn ġie dak.
I don't want to be anything.	Ma rrid inkun xejn.
I'm happy to talk	Jien kuntent li nitkellem
And it could be again.	U jista 'jkun mill-ġdid.
I understand that	Jien nifhem dak
I think about it often	Naħseb dwar dan spiss
I had no money.	Ma kellix flus.
I already know what's going on	Diġà naf x'hemm
I wanted more and more	Jien ridt aktar u aktar
I didn’t want to have to do that	Ma ridtx ikolli nagħmel dan
I didn’t really want to go back	Ma tantx ridt immur lura
I didn’t have time to think all this	Ma kellix ħin biex naħseb dan kollu
Never go back.	Qatt ma tmur lura.
He had no idea what was going on here.	Ma kellux idea ta’ x’kien qed jiġri hawn.
He expected nothing more.	Ma kien jistenna xejn aktar.
She knew what was going on.	Kienet taf x’kien qed jiġri.
Well, it could be wrong.	Ukoll, jista 'jkun ħażin.
Maybe there was someone there.	Forsi kien hemm xi ħadd hemmhekk.
He’s not here, either.	Hu mhux hawn, lanqas.
I believe he wants more for me.	Nemmen li jrid aktar għalija.
I am one and one is everything	Jien wieħed u wieħed huwa kollox
Yesterday I was nothing	Ilbieraħ ma kont xejn
You can't go without it either.	Lanqas ma tista’ tmur mingħajr.
I hope you are so	Qed nittama li inti hekk
I had a really hard time	Kelli żmien tassew diffiċli
I needed to be alone	Kelli bżonn inkun waħdi
I had had enough of this	Kelli biżżejjed minn dan
Well that was quick.	Ukoll li kien malajr.
But that's good.	Imma dak tajjeb.
I already know it won’t	Diġà naf li mhux se
Obviously I’m doing something wrong.	Ovvjament qed nagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina.
You are right, of course.	Għandek raġun, ovvjament.
It was only one time, it wasn't.	Kien biss il-ħin wieħed, ma kienx hekk.
I knew what was going on	Kont naf x’qed jiġri
I couldn't talk anymore	Ma stajtx nitkellem aktar
And no more.	U mhux aktar.
I can't understand this	Ma nistax nifhem dan
I didn’t want to wait that long	Ma ridtx nistenna daqshekk
Too late.	Tard wisq.
I knew I was here.	Kont naf li ġejt hawn.
I wish they were.	Nixtieq li kienu.
And it should have.	U għandu jkollu.
I didn’t want to talk about it	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwar dan
Plus it was actually really good.	Barra minn hekk fil-fatt kien tassew tajjeb.
I tell you no such thing	Jiena ngħidlek l-ebda ħaġa bħal din
I want you ready	Irrid li inti lest
He said he probably was.	Qal li probabbilment kien.
She was good to us.	Kienet tajba magħna.
I think that would be it.	Naħseb li dan ikun.
That makes it good enough.	Dan jagħmel tajjeb biżżejjed.
I have no problem with that.	M'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan.
I know what's going on.	Naf x’qed jiġri.
It’s my only chance.	Huwa l-uniku ċans tiegħi.
I know he was surprised	Naf li kien sorpriż
I thought something might be wrong with you.	Ħsibt li xi ħaġa tista’ tkun ħażina miegħek.
I don't know how.	Ma nafx kif.
I can't tell you everything	Ma nistax ngħidlek kollox
And nothing happens.	U ma jiġri xejn.
But it was only for a time.	Imma kien biss għal żmien.
I know it’s great	Naf li huwa tajjeb ħafna
I want to eat someone here	Irrid niekol lil xi ħadd hawn
Which you can't do.	Li ma tistax tagħmel.
This is not going to be my home.	Din mhix se tkun id-dar tiegħi.
I had to do something else	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra
I didn’t really know why he was coming	Fil-fatt ma kontx naf għaliex kien jiġi
I didn’t even have time to understand what was going on	Lanqas kelli ħin biex nifhem dak li kien qed jiġri
I did this with you today	Dan għamilt miegħek illum
There are things you just know.	Hemm affarijiet li taf biss.
I would be ready.	Inkun lest.
I know better than not	Naf aħjar milli le
I could only see that there was only one car there	Stajt nara biss li hemm karozza waħda hemmhekk
I can't say for sure	Ma nistax ngħid żgur
Time to go.	Żmien li mmur.
His doing very well for this.	Tiegħu jagħmel tajjeb ħafna għal dan.
But it hadn't happened to anyone.	Imma ma kienx ġara lil ħadd.
Or made time.	Jew għamel il-ħin.
Look better too.	Ħares aħjar ukoll.
I know you think so	Naf li taħseb hekk
I have been here many times	Ilni hawn ħafna drabi
I had this happen before	Kelli dan jiġri qabel
She wants to do it.	Hija tixtieq li tagħmel dan.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.	Ma rridx nitkellem aktar dwarha.
It is a difficult time.	Huwa żmien diffiċli.
I should probably try to be sure.	Probabbilment għandi nipprova biex inkun ċert.
I'll be back before I speak again	Jiena noqgħod lura qabel ma nerġa' nitkellem
He seems to know everyone.	Jidher tassew li jaf lil kulħadd.
But not the same thing.	Imma mhux l-istess ħaġa.
I didn’t even know anymore	Jien lanqas biss kont naf aktar
It usually was.	Normalment kienet.
I was so worried about how it would take this	Kont tant inkwetat dwar kif se tieħu dan
I just wanted some time for myself	Ridt biss ftit ħin għalija
I want you to know.	Irrid li tkun taf.
It's so bad.	Huwa daqshekk ħażin.
A year later you can.	Sena wara tista'.
And be better.	U tkun aħjar.
How many.	Kemm ħafna.
This is more difficult.	Din hija aktar diffiċli.
I probably won't be home tonight	Probabbilment mhux se nkun id-dar illejla
Plan something on your own.	Tippjana xi ħaġa waħedha.
She was going home.	Kienet tmur id-dar.
I'm ready to go now.	Jien lest li mmur issa.
He wanted to be.	Ried jiġi.
But that was a little more than that for me.	Imma dan kien ftit aktar minn hekk għalija.
U, u, u.	U, u, u.
I hadn’t done this forever	Jien ma kontx għamilt dan għal dejjem
It's really bad.	Huwa tassew ħażin.
And so it does.	U hekk jagħmel.
You have to say this years ago.	Għandek tgħid dan snin ilu.
I couldn't understand how you know	Ma stajtx nifhem kif taf
He doesn’t want to do that.	Ma jridx jagħmel dan.
I wasn't sure what it would be	Jien ma kontx ċert x’se jkun
She was coming.	Kienet tiġi.
And it is.	U huwa.
She just sees me.	Hija biss tara lili.
I want to see if it’s home	Irrid nara jekk hux id-dar
I’m always here, if you need to talk or anything.	Jien dejjem hawn, jekk għandek bżonn titkellem jew xi ħaġa.
Like everyone else does, really.	Bħal kulħadd jagħmel, tassew.
You can’t tell unless you know.	Ma tistax tgħid sakemm ma tkunx taf.
I did the same	Għamilt l-istess
I can't do it anymore	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar
I shouldn't wait	M'għandix nistenna
I wasn’t wondering where we were	Ma kontx nistaqsi fejn konna
I won’t try, that’s for sure	Mhux se nipprova, dan żgur
I can say it’s great.	Nista 'ngħid li huwa kbir.
Hardly anyone did that.	Kważi ħadd ma għamel hekk.
Nothing is better than doing nothing.	Xejn hu aħjar milli ma tagħmel xejn.
I was both.	Jien kont it-tnejn.
I haven't been there in a few years	Ilni ma kontx hemm ftit snin
I could hear him talking	Stajt nisma’ jitkellem
And when it does, it may not be the same.	U meta jagħmel, jista 'ma jkunx l-istess.
And that was a good thing.	U dik kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
It didn’t have to be.	Ma kellux ikun.
I didn’t think it was good to talk to you.	Ma kontx naħseb li kien tajjeb li nitkellem miegħek.
Maybe you're on that.	Forsi int fuq dak.
I knew it would look really good here.	Kont naf li se tidher tassew tajba hawn.
He still doesn't.	Huwa għadu ma.
I’ve never been so with you!	Jien qatt ma kont hekk miegħek!
I just wanted to know what happened	Ridt biss li tkun taf x’ġara
I'll tell you how to do it	Jien ngħidlek kif tagħmel dan
I didn’t have time to think about what happened	Ma kellix ħin naħseb dwar dak li ġara
It goes that way.	Jmur hekk.
I need someone to be there	Għandi bżonn xi ħadd li jkun hemm
I needed to know more	Kelli bżonn inkun naf aktar
It is very difficult.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna.
I also know what is good and what is bad	Jien ukoll naf x’inhu tajjeb u x’inhu ħażin
I would like to see this.	Nixtieq nara dan.
I never thought too much about it	Qatt ma ħsibt wisq dwarha
Now you had one.	Issa kellek waħda.
So he knew.	Hekk kien jaf.
I don’t know if I ever was.	Ma nafx jekk qatt kont.
They really are.	Huma tassew.
Only work you can do	Xogħol inti biss tista' tagħmel
He was coming back.	Kien ġej lura.
I didn’t have to wait	Ma kellix għalfejn nistenna
That's pretty easy.	Dak huwa pjuttost faċli.
I just can’t.	Jien biss ma nistax.
I know it’s the same for you	Naf li huwa l-istess għalik
I think it would be something more	Naħseb li tkun xi ħaġa aktar
This may take a few years.	Dan jista 'jieħu ftit snin.
It came to each.	Wasal għal kull wieħed.
It wasn’t working, obviously.	Ma kienx qed jaħdem, ovvjament.
I mean, here it comes again.	Jien ngħid, hawn ġej mill-ġdid.
Everyone has.	Kulħadd għandu.
I know this is not always easy.	Naf li dan mhux dejjem faċli.
He knows a lot about who he is.	Jaf ħafna min hu.
Or something else.	Jew xi ħaġa oħra.
I could expect a little more	Stajt nistenna ftit aktar
She knew it.	Hija kienet taf dan.
I do everything for you	Jien nagħmel kollox għalik
He is working there.	Qed jaħdem hemm.
Or was it.	Jew kien.
It's just not there.	Huwa biss mhux hemm.
I can tell when you're doing this	Nista 'ngħid meta tkun qed tagħmel dan
It takes more time.	Huwa jieħu aktar żmien.
I was sure.	Kont ċert.
A lot is happening.	Qed jiġri ħafna.
Which was good to say.	Li kien tajjeb li ngħid.
I have you now	Ikolli inti issa
I'm fine now.	Jien tajjeb issa.
He says he wants to do good for me.	Jgħid li jrid jagħmel tajjeb għalija.
I can’t believe he does that	Ma nistax nemmen li jagħmel dan
And so on.	U hekk hekk.
He was now dressed to go home.	Issa kien liebes biex imur id-dar.
It happens that there is more than there isn’t.	Jiġri li jkun hemm aktar milli le hemm.
He went as he wanted to go	Huwa mar kif ried imur
It had been a long time coming.	Kien ilu żmien twil ġej.
Or very little will.	Jew ftit li xejn se.
Who do you think she is.	Min taħseb hi.
I didn’t even think about it	Lanqas ma ħsibt dwar dan
I think he played for me	Naħseb li kellu għalija
I wish it shouldn’t be so	Nixtieq li ma kellux ikun hekk
Put it back.	Poġġa lura.
It was nothing more.	Ma kien xejn aktar.
Like she had no friends.	Bħal ma kellha l-ebda ħbieb.
I didn’t really think about it at the time	Ma tantx kont naħseb dwarha dak iż-żmien
And good work on that.	U xogħol tajjeb fuq dan.
I didn't know what happened	Ma kontx naf x’ġara
It should work for you.	Għandu jaħdem għalik.
It's easy to make friends.	Huwa faċli li tagħmel ħbieb.
Something is happening, and soon.	Qed jiġri xi ħaġa, u dalwaqt.
That often happens.	Dak spiss jiġri.
I hope nothing went wrong	Nispera li xejn ma mar ħażin
I didn't have a good time	Ma tantx kelli żmien tajjeb
Something must be wrong.	Xi ħaġa trid tkun ħażina.
It had never happened so before.	Qatt ma kien ġara hekk qabel.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwar dan.
Which it wasn’t.	Li ma kienx.
I just don't.	I biss ma.
Not so good anymore.	Mhux daqshekk tajjeb aktar.
I had never thought of it before	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwarha qabel
I try to understand.	Nipprova nifhem.
I’m not sure it’s pretty good either.	M'inix ċert li huwa pjuttost tajjeb lanqas.
And it doesn’t have to be much.	U m'għandux għalfejn ikun ħafna.
I believe he will do a good job.	Nemmen li se jagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
He still looked like a little boy.	Kien għadu qisu tifel żgħir.
And not like that.	U mhux bħal dan.
I wasn’t there at the time	Jien ma kontx dak iż-żmien
Well, it’s the same with me.	Ukoll, huwa l-istess miegħi.
I made sure of that.	Jien għamilt ċert minn dan.
And maybe that’s a good thing.	U forsi dik hija ħaġa tajba.
This is someone who is like a child.	Dan huwa xi ħadd li huwa bħal tifel.
I don’t know at all what will happen.	Ma nafx għal kollox x'se jiġri.
It's easy to talk.	Huwa faċli li titkellem.
Maybe I need more time.	Forsi għandi bżonn aktar ħin.
I didn’t think so.	Jien ma kontx naħseb.
They will do the same.	Huma se jagħmlu l-istess.
He was my friend.	Huwa kien ħabib tiegħi.
I had everything, anything anyone could ever want	Kelli kollox, dak kollu li xi ħadd jista’ qatt irid
But that’s not what happened.	Imma dan mhux dak li ġara.
I want this with you	Irrid dan miegħek
I couldn’t be sure he would do the job	Ma stajtx inkun ċert li se tagħmel ix-xogħol
There was a lot of work with little time.	Kien hemm ħafna xogħol bi ftit ħin.
He is a good man.	Huwa raġel tajjeb.
I knew he wasn’t going to	Kont naf li ma kienx se
I expect this to be.	Nistenna li dan ikun.
I just heard.	Għadni kemm smajt.
I did it without even thinking about it	Għamilt mingħajr lanqas biss ħsibt dwarha
I couldn’t help but love it	Ma stajtx ma nħobbx
This is working fine.	Dan qed jaħdem tajjeb.
But there was always something.	Imma dejjem kien hemm xi ħaġa.
This can be both good and bad.	Dan jista 'jkun kemm tajjeb kif ukoll ħażin.
Here are mine.	Hawn huma tiegħi.
I’m too young for him.	Jien żgħir wisq għalih.
Something was really wrong.	Xi ħaġa kienet verament ħażina.
I’m not here to do that.	Jien mhux hawn biex nagħmel dan.
It's not really you.	Mhuwiex verament int.
It's too good.	Huwa tajjeb wisq.
There is so much we can be doing.	Tant nistgħu nkunu qed nagħmlu.
I can't go home anymore	Ma nistax immur aktar id-dar
But he did.	Imma hekk għamel.
I would be fine.	Inkun tajjeb.
It's a job.	Huwa xogħol.
What he says is done	Dak li jgħid isir
There is more to say.	Hemm aktar xi tgħid.
I can't understand what he was saying	Ma nistax nifhem xejn x’kien qed jgħid
I'm very, very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna, ħafna.
He seems to have.	Jidher li għandu.
For him it was nothing.	Għalih ma kien xejn.
But there is something else about the book.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa oħra dwar il-ktieb.
It certainly can't happen again.	Żgur li ma jistax jerġa’ jiġri.
You will be glad you did.	Int tkun ferħan li għamilt.
I wonder if it is always so.	Nistaqsi jekk hux dejjem hekk.
It is not.	Mhuwiex.
I don’t want to think about it.	Ma rridx naħseb dwarha.
But he was a man.	Imma kien raġel.
I think there is another way	Naħseb li hemm mod ieħor
We know what it is.	Nafu x’inhu.
Everyone thinks so.	Kulħadd jaħseb hekk.
I thought maybe you know	Ħsibt li forsi taf
Not hard to take, no, not hard to take.	Mhux diffiċli biex tieħu, le, mhux diffiċli biex tieħu.
This until recently.	Dan sa ftit ilu.
I hope to talk to you again	Nispera li nerġa' nitkellem miegħek
Tonight, not so.	Illejla, mhux hekk.
A long time back.	Żmien twil lura.
He played.	Huwa kellu.
But not so, my friends.	Imma mhux hekk, ħbieb tiegħi.
See what happens here	Nara x’qed jiġri hawn
All, all, all.	Kollha, kollha, kollha.
I can’t believe it just happened	Ma nistax nemmen li ġara biss
But I didn’t expect her to be with me	Imma ma kontx nistenna li tkun miegħi
It's too early.	Huwa kmieni wisq.
I think there is something to be said about this.	Naħseb li hemm xi ħaġa xi tgħid dwar dan.
I was doing everything for him and he knew it	Jien kont nagħmel kollox għalih u dan kien jaf
Just the things you say.	Biss l-affarijiet li tgħid.
I was saying that	Jien kont qed ngħid hekk
Have someone else here.	Għandhom xi ħadd ieħor hawn.
She knew that if she did, she would know how she felt.	Kien jaf li jekk għamel hekk, hi se tkun taf kif ħassu.
Now it seems you don't like it.	Issa jidher li inti ma bħal dan.
There is none of this now.	M'hemm xejn minn dan issa.
I have nothing to say	M'għandi xejn xi ngħid
I'm glad you're here !.	Jien kuntent li qiegħed hawn!.
You are here, not there.	Inti hawn, mhux hemm.
I don’t even know how to do that.	Lanqas naf kif tagħmel dan.
I didn't hear	Jien ma kontx nisma’
Not just for me, but for everyone.	Mhux għalija biss, imma għal kulħadd.
Do more than talk about it.	Tagħmel aktar milli titkellem dwarha.
Now is not the time.	Issa mhux iż-żmien.
You were a boy here.	Inti kont tifel hawn.
That had never happened before.	Dak qatt ma kien ġara qabel.
I wasn’t even here.	Lanqas kont hawn.
I suspect he will talk about it	Nissuspetta li se jitkellem dwarha
I thought about what I said	Ħsibt dwar dak li għedt
I wanted to be me again	Jien ridt inkun jien mill-ġdid
I was watching but I couldn't do anything	Kont qed nara imma ma stajt nagħmel xejn
Look at things.	Ħares l-affarijiet.
I just want to see what it looks like now	Irrid biss nara kif jidher issa
I was pretty sure of that.	Jien kont pjuttost ċert minn dan.
It was not his home.	Ma kinitx id-dar tiegħu.
I know you will say no	Naf li se tgħid le
Never really be afraid of anything.	Qatt verament jibża' minn xejn.
It couldn’t have come at a better time.	Ma setax jasal fi żmien aħjar.
And she was.	U kienet kienet.
I don’t know if this works or not.	Ma nafx jekk dan jaħdem jew le.
Someone else did.	Xi ħadd ieħor għamel.
She knew she would.	Kienet taf li kieku.
Maybe he's here.	Forsi qiegħed hawn.
This will never go away.	Dan qatt mhu se jitlaq.
she says.	hi tgħid.
He was actually surprised.	Huwa kien fil-fatt sorpriż.
I definitely hope it was the first	Żgur li nittama li kien l-ewwel
Not so sure.	Mhux daqshekk ċert.
I couldn’t understand why I was	Ma stajtx nifhem għaliex jien
Here is why.	Hawn hu għaliex.
I didn't have to be afraid.	Ma kellix għalfejn nibża'.
I can really say it was great	Nista 'verament ngħid li kien tajjeb ħafna
It's nothing like that.	Huwa xejn bħal dan.
Not for long.	Mhux għal żmien twil.
But really, it’s not.	Imma verament, mhuwiex.
I wanted to, more than anything	Ridt, aktar minn kull ħaġa
But here, come with me.	Imma hawn, ejja miegħi.
But too much is wrong.	Imma wisq huwa ħażin.
Good to take.	Tajjeb li tieħu.
The truth is that no one knows for sure.	Il-verità hi li ħadd ma jaf żgur.
And that's about it.	U li madwar.
This is not good.	Dan mhux tajjeb.
I am thinking of you	Qed naħseb għalik
I have to be home.	Ikolli nkun id-dar.
That's it.	Dak hu.
You have no idea.	M'għandekx idea.
That just looked good.	Dan biss deher tajjeb.
I needed to see that house for a while.	Kelli bżonn nara dik id-dar għal ftit żmien.
I hope you can do that too	Nispera li tista' tagħmel dan ukoll
I can't tell you	Ma nistax ngħidlek
Surely everyone does.	Żgur li kulħadd jagħmel dan.
I believe you don’t	Nemmen li ma tagħmilx dan
It was the truth.	Kienet il-verità.
I wasn’t going back	Jien ma kontx immur lura
That's fast enough.	Dak malajr biżżejjed.
I'm afraid it won't work.	Nibża li mhux se jaħdem.
That was too much, too fast.	Dan kien wisq, malajr wisq.
I was surprised too	Jien kont sorpriż ukoll
That would have been wrong.	Dan kien ikun ħażin.
I see one there that is there	Nara wieħed hemm li hemm
Now it's done.	Issa sar.
It really isn't.	Huwa verament mhux.
I knew it was going to come	Kont naf li kienet se tiġi
I saw you around.	Rajt inti madwar.
There was only one problem.	Kien hemm problema waħda biss.
Who is leaving, if he survives today.	Min qed jitlaq, jekk jibqa’ jgħix wara llum.
I will not believe this	Jien mhux se nemmen dan
But this is it.	Imma dan hu.
I hope there will be work for you	Nistenna li se jkun hemm xogħol għalik
That’s not so long ago.	Dak mhux daqshekk twil ilu.
I didn’t need to see anymore.	Ma kellix bżonn nara aktar.
I can't either.	Ma nistax lanqas.
As many people do.	Kif jagħmlu ħafna nies.
Often it is not.	Ħafna drabi ma jkunx.
I like to be alone	Inħobb inkun waħdi
As expected.	Milli kien jistenna.
No one else in the room agreed.	Ħadd ieħor fil-kamra ma qabel.
Either that or nothing was happening outside.	Jew dak jew xejn ma kien qed jiġri barra.
And maybe other things.	U forsi affarijiet oħra.
Or it should be.	Jew għandu jkun.
It works and is so good.	Jaħdem u huwa tant tajjeb.
I told the truth and I couldn't do it anymore	Għidt il-verità u ma stajtx nagħmel aktar
And you can’t go home, either.	U inti ma tistax tmur id-dar, lanqas.
And a few other things.	U ftit affarijiet oħra.
I didn't see anything either	Lanqas ma rajt xejn
I haven’t heard anything back.	Għadni ma smajt xejn lura.
It can be very difficult.	Jista’ jkun diffiċli ħafna.
I may be knowing what it is.	I jista 'jkun naf dak li hu.
But not us.	Imma mhux aħna.
It was often enough.	Spiss kien biżżejjed.
Pretty big job, actually	Xogħol pjuttost kbir, fil-fatt
Great.	Kbir.
And certainly not so.	U żgur mhux hekk.
He had no chance.	Ma kellu l-ebda ċans.
He was ready, and he was capable.	Kien lest, u kien kapaċi.
It was good, so good.	Kien tajjeb, hekk tajjeb.
He had none.	Ma kellu l-ebda.
I know he can.	Naf li jista’.
I can't believe it	Ma nistax nemmen
Looks like now.	Qisu issa.
And this is not a good thing.	U din mhix xi ħaġa tajba.
I didn’t have time to think	Ma kellix ħin biex naħseb
No, he didn’t want to.	Le, ma riedx hekk.
I didn’t know where I was going	Ma kontx naf fejn se mmur
I came for you.	Jien ġejt għalik.
I needed to go to him	Kelli bżonn immur għandu
You don't know.	Inti ma tkunx taf.
It probably won't work.	Probabbilment mhux se jaħdem.
It can happen forever.	Huwa jista 'jiġri għal dejjem.
Or the first time, actually.	Jew l-ewwel darba, fil-fatt.
I want to be a good person like that.	Irrid inkun persuna tajba hekk.
No, not the first.	Le, mhux l-ewwel.
But not entirely bad.	Imma mhux għal kollox ħażin.
And he was willing to go further.	U kien lest li jmur aktar.
He went, and she did.	Huwa mar, u hi għamlet.
I wasn't expecting anyone	Ma kont qed nistenna lil ħadd
I just wanted to get out of here	Ridt biss barra minn hawn
When, he can't say.	Meta, ma jistax jgħid.
This is the last time.	Din hija l-aħħar darba.
I just wanted everything to stay the way it was	Ridt biss li kollox jibqa’ kif kien
It’s still around today.	Għadu madwar illum.
I had no idea why.	Ma kellix idea għaliex.
Something looks wrong.	Xi ħaġa tidher ħażina.
I have seen people do this.	Rajt nies jagħmlu dan.
I still couldn't believe he told me so	Għadni ma stajtx nemmen li qalli hekk
I hope it helps.	Nittama li jgħin.
He just does it.	Huwa biss tagħmel dan.
Maybe he is.	Forsi hu.
I will not do anything like that again	Mhux se nerġa’ nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik
This is his home.	Din hija d-dar tiegħu.
I’m not worried about that.	M'iniex inkwetat dwar dan.
He just died.	Huwa biss miet.
I don’t know why.	Ma nafx għalfejn.
That would be really something.	Dik kienet tkun tassew xi ħaġa.
I really will.	Jien verament se.
It is now working.	Issa qed jaħdem.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Aħjar milli ma’ ħafna nies meta tkun l-ewwel darba.
I didn’t want to be a person	Ma ridtx li jkun persuna
It is whatever you want it to be.	Hija tkun xi tkun trid li tkun.
This seems like a good idea to me.	Din tidher idea tajba għalija.
I have to do it alone.	Ikolli nagħmel dan waħdi.
It was before.	Kien qabel.
I only need a year	Għandi bżonn biss sena
Soon, everything she needed	Ftit ħin, dak kollu li kellha bżonn
It was mine.	Kien tiegħi.
He will be back later.	Hu ser jiġi lura aktar tard.
I know you have problems	Naf li għandek problemi
I’m happy and content	Jien kuntent u kuntent
It will do the same.	Se tagħmel l-istess.
It's bad.	Huwa ħażin.
Not sure what is going wrong.	Mhux ċert x'inhu sejjer ħażin.
There may be more.	Jista 'jkun hemm aktar.
I should be.	I għandu jkun.
I haven't had one in a long time	Ilni ma kellix hekk
I didn’t even know it was there	Lanqas kont naf li kien hemm
I’m staying a little longer	Qed noqgħod ftit aktar
I can’t see that happening.	Ma nistax nara li jiġri.
I didn’t want him to leave	Ma ridtx li jitlaq
I can see that it is still.	Nista' nara li għadu.
I hadn’t thought about it before	Ma kontx ħsibt dwarha qabel
She just sat down.	Hija biss poġġa bilqiegħda.
It's time.	Huwa żmien.
I have one for both of us	Ikolli waħda għalina t-tnejn
And she did more than that.	U għamlet aktar minn hekk.
But this cannot be.	Imma dan ma jistax ikun.
I think we should go there	Naħseb li għandna mmorru hemm
Nothing was working.	Xejn ma kien qed jaħdem.
He had not left.	Ma kienx telaq.
I think it would be good for you	Naħseb li tkun tajba għalik
Something happened when he died.	Xi ħaġa ġara meta miet.
It may be too late.	Jista’ jkun li nkunu tard wisq.
You know what you're doing, he doesn't.	Taf x’qed tagħmel, hu le.
It's who they are.	Huwa min huma.
I want to be sure	Irrid li tkun ċert
I think everyone knows when it’s time to go.	Naħseb li kulħadd jaf meta wasal iż-żmien li jmur.
You have to do whatever you want.	Int trid tagħmel dak kollu li trid.
For some time he saw no one.	Għal xi żmien ma ra lil ħadd.
I have enough trouble to be alone	Għandi biżżejjed problemi biex inkun biss jien
I thought I might be with you	Ħsibt li tista’ tkun miegħek
It won't.	Mhux se.
I may never go.	Jien forsi qatt ma mmur.
I want to be with you	Irrid inkun miegħek
Something is happening.	Qed jiġri xi ħaġa.
Not a little.	Mhux xi ftit.
I couldn't understand anything	Ma stajt nifhem xejn
Now home.	Issa d-dar.
Not that you are not going to do that.	Mhux li m'intix se tagħmel dan.
Well, who knows.	Ukoll, min jaf.
I can't be around anyone right now	Ma nista’ nkun madwar ħadd issa
I needed to know where she was.	Kelli bżonn inkun naf fejn kienet.
You are not from here.	M'intix minn hawn.
I know he won't be back	Naf li mhux se jkun lura
I didn’t have time to wait.	Ma kellix ħin nistenna.
I want us to be together	Irrid li nkunu flimkien
But this is too little, too late.	Imma dan huwa ftit wisq, tard wisq.
If anything is.	Jekk xi ħaġa hija.
This is becoming too easy.	Dan qed isir faċli wisq.
And a lot of people do.	U ħafna nies jagħmlu.
I heard one.	Smajt wieħed.
I can’t wait for the next one	Ma nistax nistenna li ġej
I couldn’t do anything about it.	Ma stajt nagħmel xejn dwar dan.
I don’t know how to do that	Ma nafx kif jagħmlu dan
I already know who you are	Diġà naf min int
He knew what you were thinking.	Kien jaf x’qed taħseb.
She knew she would.	Kienet taf li kieku.
And they just are.	U huma biss.
All the while, he’s talking to me.	Il-ħin kollu, qed jitkellem miegħi.
It seemed that.	Huwa deher li.
I just couldn't	I biss ma setax
I wanted that for him	Jien ridt li għalih
Everything went.	Kollox mar.
This is pretty big.	Dan huwa pjuttost kbir.
Very so.	Ħafna hekk.
She says for sure.	Hi tgħid żgur.
And so, and so on.	U hekk, u fuq.
I doubt he does.	Niddubita li jagħmel.
And it will never be there.	U qatt mhu se jkun hemm.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Dan mhu ħażin xejn.
I needed to be alone to do this	Kelli bżonn inkun waħdi biex nagħmel dan
That last one was pretty good.	Dik l-aħħar waħda kienet pjuttost tajba.
I know a lot of people	Naf ħafna nies
I didn't see anything.	Jien ma rajt xejn.
Not even a little.	Lanqas ftit.
No other person would be as good as you.	L-ebda persuna oħra ma kienet tkun daqshekk tajba daqskemm kont int.
He doesn’t want any more.	Ma jridx aktar.
I’m glad she did.	Jien ferħan li għamlet.
Surely she knew by now.	Żgur li issa kienet taf.
I went to see what was going on	Mort nara x’qed jiġri
Now you know a lot about everything.	Issa taf ħafna minn kollox.
It probably is.	Huwa probabbilment huwa.
Sometimes this is hard to do.	Xi drabi dan huwa diffiċli li tagħmel.
If we do they do.	Jekk nagħmlu huma jagħmlu.
I just want to hear	Irrid biss li nisma'
I saw everything	Rajt kollox
It would work with almost nothing.	Ikun jaħdem bi kważi xejn.
I can't have one of my own	Ma nistax ikolli waħda minn tiegħi
I want to be happy	Irrid inkun kuntent
I can say many things	Nista’ ngħid ħafna affarijiet
I have no idea what to say	M’għandi l-ebda idea x’se tgħid
He can work back from that.	Huwa jista 'jaħdem lura minn dak.
I just wanted to do a good job	Ridt biss nagħmel xogħol tajjeb
I hadn’t done anything wrong	Jien ma kont għamilt xejn ħażin
I just want to be	Nixtieq inkun biss
Why? 	Għaliex?
I didn’t want to be alone	Ma ridtx inkun waħdi
It was something more	Kienet xi ħaġa aktar
I just need to think things through	Għandi bżonn biss naħseb l-affarijiet
Everything you really need.	Dak kollu li għandek bżonn verament.
Everything was working.	Kollox kien jaħdem.
I had never seen anything so beautiful	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa daqshekk sabiħa
I want to be really tired	Irrid inkun tassew għajjien
Here comes home.	Hawn jiġi d-dar.
Maybe not everyone.	Forsi mhux kulħadd.
I have never thought about this before	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan qabel
I was small.	Kont żgħir.
Maybe not for everyone, but it did for me.	Forsi mhux għal kulħadd, imma hekk għamel għalija.
I hope she was still with him	Jien nittama li kienet għadha miegħu
And then time now.	U dak iż-żmien issa.
You don't want money.	Inti ma tridx flus.
I was not interested.	Ma kontx interessat.
It was not coming.	Ma kienx ġej.
Time had passed, of course.	Iż-żmien kien għadda, ovvjament.
I'm nothing like that.	Jien xejn bħal dan.
You are not well.	M'intix tajjeb.
I thought it was still	Ħsibt li kien għadu
But that was too much.	Imma dan kien wisq.
This cannot be.	Dan ma jistax ikun.
I need you to do this for me	Għandi bżonn li tagħmel dan għalija
As she looks.	Kif tidher hi.
Great idea, isn't it?	Idea kbira, hux.
You will know more later.	Se tkun taf aktar aktar tard.
It has something to say.	Għandu xi jgħid.
I'm sure of it	Jien ċert minn dan
It would be enough.	Ikun biżżejjed.
I wasn't tired at all	Jien ma kont għajjien xejn
Will he survive ?.	Se jgħix?.
We need your help.	Għandna bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
She is back home today.	Hija lura d-dar illum.
Good job too.	Xogħol tajjeb ukoll.
It looks great.	Jidher kbir.
I think that was the first thing	Naħseb li dik kienet l-ewwel ħaġa
In fact, she is not.	Fil-fatt, hi mhix.
I hope to be out of here when that happens	Nispera li nkun barra minn hawn meta jiġri hekk
I always knew it could happen	Dejjem kont naf li xi darba jista’ jiġri
Work done.	Xogħol lest.
This has just started this week.	Dan għadu kif beda din il-ġimgħa.
I have no problem with that either.	Jien m'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan ukoll.
He was playing.	Kien qed jilgħab.
I could eat something	Jien stajt niekol xi ħaġa
A good one, but only so	Waħda tajba, imma hekk biss
There was time to think.	Kien hemm żmien biex taħseb.
I don’t think they do	Ma naħsibx li jagħmlu
He could have thought better of himself.	Huwa seta 'jaħseb aħjar waħdu.
I was scared.	Rajt jibża.
I'm afraid what will happen	Nibża’ x’se jiġri
Now he could see.	Issa seta' jara.
Everything is still coming now, now, now.	Kollox għadu ġej issa, issa, issa.
I just want to be happy	Irrid inkun kuntent biss
I didn’t want to be me and them	Ma ridtx li nkunu jien u huma
It’s not really a big deal for me.	Mhuwiex verament ħaġa kbira għalija.
Just that they were there, when he was little.	Biss li kienu hemm, meta kien żgħir.
That's what.	Dik x'inhi.
Not much more.	Mhux wisq aktar.
But no one knows anything.	Imma ħadd ma jaf xejn.
I knew it was a big one	Kont naf li kienet waħda kbira
I want to be here and now	Irrid inkun hawn u issa
All or finished.	Kollha jew lest.
But you are not tired.	Imma m'intix għajjien.
We had a car that was.	Kellna karozza li kienet.
I can see what happened	Nista’ nara x’ġara
You never go to school.	Inti qatt ma tmur l-iskola.
I couldn't even tell you why	Lanqas stajt ngħidlek għaliex
That was a bad idea.	Din kienet idea ħażina.
I didn't hear or see anything	Jien ma smajt jew rajt xejn
Look around quickly.	Ħares malajr madwar.
In fact it was really good.	Fil-fatt kien tassew tajjeb.
I actually thought I wasn’t capable	Fil-fatt ħsibt li ma kienx kapaċi
Everything is one for us.	Kollox huwa wieħed għalina.
When was the time.	Meta kien il-ħin.
There is no easy way to say this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod faċli biex tgħid dan.
It’s all the same.	Huwa kollu l-istess.
It does the same.	Jagħmel l-istess.
That’s not so long.	Dak mhux daqshekk twil.
I don't like it	Jien ma nħobbx
I can't even sit outside	Lanqas nista’ noqgħod bilqiegħda barra
It was hard, it really was.	Kien diffiċli, kien tassew.
None of the above.	L-ebda minn ta fuq.
It was late afternoon.	Kien tard wara nofsinhar.
He will not go there again.	Mhux se jerġa' jmur hemm.
I definitely wouldn't	Żgur li ma kontx se
I was never very interested	Qatt ma kont interessat ħafna
I never thought about it	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha
But he thought a little.	Imma ħaseb ftit.
I hope not	Jien nittama li ma jkunx hemm
I went home.	Mort id-dar.
Never say it's hard.	Qatt tgħid li huwa diffiċli.
I didn’t even know I was at school	Lanqas kont naf li kont kont l-iskola
I have to go now.	Ikolli sejjer issa.
I was too scared to be alone	Kont nibża’ wisq biex inkun waħdi
I can still do that.	Għadni nista' nagħmel dan.
I need some time to think	Għandi bżonn ftit ħin biex naħseb
I didn’t know who to believe	Ma kontx naf lil min se nemmen
No one here is going home.	Ħadd hawn mhu sejjer id-dar.
That was my first.	Dik kienu l-ewwel tiegħi.
But she won't.	Imma hi mhux se.
I just wanted you there	I biss ridt inti hemmhekk
That’s the only thing.	Dik hija l-unika ħaġa.
That's wrong.	Dak hu ħażin.
I don’t like that.	Ma nħobbx li hu.
I know what you want to do	Naf dak li trid tagħmel
It really doesn't.	Huwa verament ma.
I thought it was beautiful.	Ħsibt li kienet sabiħa.
I love how you are with me	Inħobb kif int miegħi
I had never said it before.	Qatt ma kont ngħid qabel.
I am so very tired.	Jien tant għajjien ħafna.
He is a big boy.	Huwa tifel kbir.
I would actually do that	Nixtieq fil-fatt li jagħmlu dan
It looks like fun.	Jidher qisu gost.
One was bad and one good.	Waħda kienet ħażina u waħda tajba.
It makes for a difficult morning.	Jagħmel għal filgħodu diffiċli.
He did so.	Huwa għamel hekk.
For three years.	Għal tliet snin.
But that’s not really what’s happening here.	Imma dak mhux verament dak li qed jiġri hawn.
I didn’t want to hope	Ma kontx ridt nittama
I make more money than he does	Jien nagħmel aktar flus milli jagħmel hu
I wasn’t on that, he thought	Jien ma kontx fuq dan, ħaseb
You never know here.	Qatt ma tkun taf hawn.
A really long time actually.	Żmien tassew twil fil-fatt.
I know, he thought.	Naf, ħaseb.
I didn’t think about anything else	Ma ħsibt fuq xi ħaġa oħra
Child you will not be soon	Tifel inti mhux se tkun dalwaqt
He may come back.	Huwa jista 'jiġi lura.
I wasn't good at all	Jien ma kont tajjeb xejn
I hope mine is the same	Jien nittama li tiegħi jkun l-istess
I definitely never thought it would happen to me	Żgur qatt ma ħsibt li se jiġri għalija
He and not.	Hu u mhux.
I want to see it happen	Nixtieq nara li jiġri
He’s not even thinking about going home.	Hu lanqas biss qed jaħseb biex imur id-dar.
So it really started.	Hekk verament beda.
And he wants to eat my dog.	U jrid jiekol il-kelb tiegħi.
And that’s when you knew it.	U dak meta kont taf.
It was good.	Kien tajjeb.
I wasn’t sure I was sure	Ma kontx ċert li kont ċert
I had no idea there was so much	Ma kellix idea li kien hemm daqshekk
There are many, in fact.	Hemm ħafna, fil-fatt.
He really does.	Huwa verament jagħmel.
No one knew who we were	Ħadd ma kien jaf min konna
We have little time.	Għandna ftit ħin.
That’s the last thing he would do.	Dik hija l-aħħar ħaġa li kien jagħmel.
In fact.	Fil-fatt.
I didn’t want to.	Ma ridtx.
You are not my friend.	M'intix ħabib tiegħi.
That we are.	Li aħna.
He gave everything he had.	Ta dak kollu li kellu.
But it looks good.	Imma jidher tajjeb.
Very good, actually.	Tajjeb ħafna, fil-fatt.
You don't need to.	M'għandekx bżonn.
It is both mine and not mine.	Hija kemm tiegħi kif ukoll mhux tiegħi.
I wonder how it is going	Nistaqsi kif sejjer
It just takes a little work.	Huwa biss jieħu ftit xogħol.
First I try there.	L-ewwel nipprova hemm.
I think it does better.	Naħseb li jagħmel aħjar.
Well, actually.	Tajjeb, fil-fatt.
What it looks like.	Dak li jidher.
I was doing really well.	Kont sejjer tassew tajjeb.
I was hoping to be friends	Kont nittama li nkunu ħbieb
And not all will survive.	U mhux kollha se jgħix.
I couldn’t believe it was happening to me	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien qed jiġri lili
I know I did a lot	Naf li għamilt ħafna
I still don't know where I'm going.	Għadu ma nafx fejn sejjer.
You were a great help.	Int kont għajnuna kbira.
I thought about it	Ħsibt dwar dan
I didn’t believe that	Ma kontx nemmen li
I won’t think about it	Mhux se naħseb dwarha
I saw a lot there	Rajt ħafna hemmhekk
You only have to do this a few times at a time.	Għandek tagħmel dan biss ftit kull darba.
Faster, actually.	Aktar malajr, fil-fatt.
You are not the first to come here.	M'intix l-ewwel li ġej hawn.
He went for me.	Huwa mar għalija.
I know it was wrong.	Naf li kien ħażin.
A friend is a friend	Ħabib huwa ħabib
I want to know what that is	Irrid inkun naf x'inhu dak
Now he can't.	Issa ma jistax.
I can’t believe it, but you did	Ma nistax nemmen, imma int għamilt
Here's a lot more.	Hawn ħafna aktar.
I was not happy.	Ma kontx kuntent.
And she wasn’t the only one.	U ma kinitx l-unika waħda.
I don't know why.	Ma nafx għaliex.
We know better now.	Nafu aħjar issa.
I'm going to do something else.	Jien ser nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
And you can be.	U tista’ tkun.
Just over a year.	Ftit aktar minn sena.
I didn't even want that	Lanqas ridt dan
I think I thought I said	Naħseb li ħaseb li għidt
I have a problem before	Għandi problema qabel
If so.	Jekk jasal daqshekk.
No one could say for sure.	Ħadd ma seta’ jgħid żgur.
For a long time.	Għal żmien twil.
They were a friend.	Kienu ħabib.
I wonder what we're going to do now	Nistaqsi x’se nagħmlu issa
For one thing, it’s wrong.	Għal ħaġa waħda, huwa ħażin.
But you don’t really have to.	Imma m'għandekx verament.
I'll be back later	Inkun lura aktar tard
He didn’t know what to do about it.	Ma kienx jaf x'għandu jagħmel dwar dan.
You are my only friend.	Int l-uniku ħabib tiegħi.
I can't speak.	Ma nistax nitkellem.
I really want what you both have	Irrid ħafna dak li għandek it-tnejn
No going back.	L-ebda tmur lura.
That is enough.	Dan huwa biżżejjed.
But without looking he knew she was still there.	Imma mingħajr ma ħares kien jaf li kienet għadha hemm.
But someone thinks so.	Imma xi ħadd jaħseb hekk.
I want you to stay well	Irrid li inti toqgħod ukoll
I don’t think that’s a problem	Ma naħsibx li din hija problema
Everyone had come out.	Kulħadd kien ħareġ.
And, of course, no one can do that for so long.	U, ovvjament ħadd ma jista 'jagħmel dan għal żmien daqshekk twil.
I wanted you to know that	Jien ridt li tkun taf hekk
They are difficult.	Huma diffiċli.
She thinks maybe not quite enough.	Hi taħseb li forsi mhix pjuttost biżżejjed.
Please try.	Jekk jogħġbok ipprova.
All of this, of course, is work in progress.	Dan kollu, ovvjament, huwa xogħol li qed isir.
We will do better.	Aħna se nagħmlu aħjar.
I can't do anything.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn.
Happy now ?.	Kuntent issa?.
That's the only way I can hear it.	Dan hu l-uniku mod biex nisma’.
This could be from anything.	Dan jista 'jkun minn xi ħaġa.
Your time has passed.	Il-ħin tiegħek għadda.
You really don’t have to.	Int verament m'għandekx.
Everyone did it.	Kulħadd għamel dan.
He must survive.	Huwa għandu jgħix.
She had to go.	Kellha tmur.
I was happy to go.	Kont kuntent li mmur.
But where is he ?.	Imma fejn hu?.
It can’t be that good.	Ma jistax ikun dan tajjeb.
I thought about what he said	Ħsibt dwar dak li qal
I can't see how it happened.	Ma nistax nara kif ġara.
But he really came.	Imma hu tassew ġie.
I will never do this again.	Qatt ma nagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
I didn't know what was going to happen	Ma kontx naf x’kien se jiġri
If you can do that.	Jekk inti tista 'tagħmel dan.
But it was more than that.	Imma kien aktar minn hekk.
I don’t think that’s what it is.	Ma naħsibx li huwa dak.
I definitely wasn’t having fun	Żgur li ma kontx qed nieħu gost
There is a good chance for you.	Hemm ċans tajjeb għalik.
It does a very good job as well	Xogħol tajjeb ħafna jagħmel ukoll
Well, you’re not going to tell me you’re not.	Ukoll, m'intix ser tgħidli li m'intix.
Neither is he.	Lanqas hu.
But it has to be done.	Imma jrid isir.
Is there anything like this ?.	Hemm xi ħaġa bħal din?.
It's a beautiful idea.	Hija idea sabiħa.
She had time.	Kellha ħin.
And it was very late.	U kien tard ħafna.
I have to wish that for you	Għandi nixtieq li għalik
It looks really good to us.	Jidher qisu tassew tajjeb għalina.
I didn’t want to know any of this	Ma ridt inkun naf xejn minn dan
And there had to be.	U kellu jkun hemm.
I don’t want to stay home alone	Ma rridx noqgħod id-dar waħdi
Not here today.	Mhix hawn illum.
A few other things.	Ftit affarijiet oħra.
It was so good.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb.
I know what it looks like	Naf kif jidher
And if so, for how long.	U jekk jista’, għal kemm żmien.
He looked very good.	Huwa deher tajjeb ħafna.
I should do well or better	Għandi nagħmel ukoll jew aħjar
And always will.	U dejjem se.
They probably were.	Probabbilment kienu.
I'm very sorry	Jiddispjaċini ħafna
This was our last.	Din kienet l-aħħar tagħna.
I had a job.	Kelli xogħol.
I'm not like that either	Jien lanqas hekk
I'm so happy.	Jien daqshekk kuntent.
I can think for myself	Kapaċi naħseb waħdi
You can't do that.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan.
I know, now, where that came from	Naf, issa, minn fejn ġie dak
I already knew all this	Diġà kont naf dan kollu
That was, of course.	Dak kien, ovvjament.
I think everyone knows who he is	Naħseb li kulħadd jaf min hu
I don’t think that’s likely to happen.	Ma naħsibx li x'aktarx jiġri.
He did not do that.	Huwa ma għamel dan.
You are right, but you should not say such things.	Għandek raġun, imma m'għandekx tgħid affarijiet bħal dawn.
Good to talk.	Tajjeb li titkellem.
He didn’t need to do anything about it.	Ma kellu bżonn jagħmel dan xejn.
But they were back.	Imma kienu lura.
He seemed both worried and tired.	Huwa deher kemm inkwetat u għajjien.
I didn't even think it would happen again	Lanqas kont ħsibt li jerġa’ jiġri
But you can't talk.	Imma ma tistax titkellem.
I'm going to sit down	Jien ser noqgħod bilqiegħda
This is when it happens.	Dan huwa meta jiġri.
I want to be really loved	Irrid inkun verament inħobb
Something happened in the room.	Ġara xi ħaġa fil-kamra.
He is a good man.	Huwa raġel tajjeb.
I didn’t want to believe it.	Ma ridtx nemmen.
The time was earlier than it was yesterday evening.	Il-ħin kien aktar kmieni milli kien ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
As much as possible.	Kemm jista 'jkun.
It was so good.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb.
I wish everyone well and tired	Irrid lil kulħadd tajjeb u għajjien
Today, no one is doing that.	Illum, ħadd mhu qed jagħmel hekk.
But everyone did everything.	Imma kulħadd għamel kollox.
Or you can't.	Jew ma tistax.
I am.	Jien hu.
I want you to think of something in your room	Irrid li inti taħseb xi ħaġa fil-kamra tiegħek
He was the first to start working.	Kien l-ewwel wieħed li beda jaħdem.
I am very sorry for that	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal dan
I’m sure we both need time.	Jien ċert li t-tnejn għandna bżonn iż-żmien.
I hope you are very happy.	Nispera li int kuntent ħafna.
I definitely want to go stay with him	Żgur li nixtieq li tmur toqgħod miegħu
I was going to tell you yesterday	Kont se ngħidlek ilbieraħ
On and on and on and on go.	Fuq u fuq u fuq u fuq tmur.
And she had done nothing.	U hi ma kienet għamlet xejn.
I will be fine all the time	Inkun tajjeb il-ħin kollu
You should be happy.	Għandek tkun kuntent.
I know what you want	Naf xi trid
I was trying to make you happy	Kont qed nipprova nagħmel inti kuntent
Now I see.	Issa nara.
I had no time to think about it	Ma kelli l-ebda ħin biex naħseb dwarha
I wish you hadn’t done that	Nixtieq li ma tkunx għamlet dan
I will do something for you	Nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik
He seemed to be trying to think.	Deher jipprova jaħseb.
I think it’s a lot easier for us	Naħseb li huwa ħafna aktar faċli għalina
I knew she was there	Kont naf li kienet hemm
It was just too much for him today.	Kien ftit wisq għalih illum.
I'm just hoping she can go it alone	Qed nistenna biss li hi tista' tmur waħedha
Come on, come on.	Ejja, ejja.
He thought it would take a while.	Ħaseb li kien se jieħu xi ftit.
Obviously, we needed something better.	Ovvjament, kellna bżonn xi ħaġa aħjar.
And she.	U hi.
I want to be on top of that	Irrid inkun fuq dan
It was great for me.	Kien kbir għalija.
I was here for that.	Jien kont hawn għal dak.
I want to go back soon	Irrid immur lura dalwaqt
If this happens, this is not a problem.	Jekk jiġri dan, din mhix problema.
I'm very sorry	Jiddispjaċini ħafna
I never knew who.	Qatt ma kont naf min.
For me, he did.	Għalija, hekk għamel.
I didn’t do that	Jien ma kontx nagħmel hekk
I am so but much more.	Jien hekk imma ħafna aktar.
That’s not a good time.	Dak mhux żmien tajjeb.
I would be good for him	Inkun tajjeb għalih
I'll tell you what happened sooner or later	Ngħidlek x’ġara xi ftit jew wisq
But he didn’t seem to have it.	Imma ma deherx li kellu.
This is a must see.	Din hija tassew trid tara.
I loved school.	Kont inħobb l-iskola.
I can't do anything about it	Ma nista nagħmel xejn dwarha
Small or large.	Żgħir jew kbir.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
I couldn't see anything, I could only hear	Ma stajt nara xejn, biss nisma
And I didn’t say anything.	U ma għidt xejn.
We can do this job.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan ix-xogħol.
When he looked, there was nothing there.	Meta ħares, ma kien hemm xejn hemmhekk.
Look at what he did to me.	Ħares lejn dak li għamel miegħi.
And so they should.	U hekk għandhom.
Maybe he’s right, but really, not one to talk to.	Forsi għandu raġun, imma tassew, mhux wieħed li jitkellem.
No one appeared.	Ħadd ma deher.
You really are.	Int tassew.
I do the same thing.	Nagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
No one has been released yet.	Għadu ma ħareġ l-ebda.
I was a good person.	Jien kont persuna tajba.
He came on.	Huwa daħal fuq.
But you have to go there.	Imma trid tmur hemm.
And you don't have to.	U m'għandekx.
Some people do.	Xi nies jagħmlu.
There is much more.	Hemm ħafna aktar.
I shouldn't be.	M'għandix inkun.
I was trying to understand	Kont qed nipprova nifhem
There was only one.	Kien hemm wieħed biss.
I wonder how she knew that	Nistaqsi kif kienet taf dan
But so be it.	Imma hekk ikun.
I had a lot of friends there	Kelli ħafna ħbieb hemmhekk
It was something we should have known.	Kienet xi ħaġa li kellna nkunu nafu.
There is only one way to do this.	Hemm mod wieħed biss biex tagħmel dan.
But it never does.	Imma qatt ma jagħmel.
I had never seen it before	Qatt ma kont rajt hekk qabel
He wants to know everything.	Irid ikun jaf kollox.
She says nothing.	Hija ma tgħid xejn.
I just wanted to know when I got home	Ridt biss inkun naf meta ġejt id-dar
It was good for him.	Kien tajjeb għalih.
I want to tell you a few things, too	Irrid ngħidlek xi affarijiet, ukoll
We will not.	Aħna mhux se.
You have to come now.	Int għandek tiġi issa.
And you will be.	U int tkun.
I don’t have to, anymore.	M'għandix, aktar.
This is how it works here.	Dan huwa kif dan jaħdem hawn.
I’ve been thinking a lot about this for a while	Ħsibt ħafna dwar dan għal xi żmien
I didn’t know for sure	Ma kontx naf żgur
It's not very big.	Huwa mhux kbir ħafna.
I was thinking about it last night	Kont qed naħseb dwarha lbieraħ filgħaxija
I do such things.	Nagħmel affarijiet bħal dawn.
Well, that was really hard for me.	Ukoll, dan kien verament diffiċli għalija.
Nothing, he had said.	Xejn, kien qal.
Too late.	Sa tard wisq.
I can't talk to anyone	Ma nista’ nitkellem ma’ ħadd
He didn’t know how much time had passed.	Ma kienx jaf kemm għadda żmien.
You know what's good.	Inti taf x'inhu tajjeb.
And it wasn’t enough.	U ma kienx biżżejjed.
But they have a problem.	Imma għandhom problema.
More than a year ago.	Aktar minn sena ilu.
But now, we have.	Imma issa, għandna.
I'm not going there.	Mhux sejjer hemm.
So can we, you and me.	Hekk nistgħu aħna, int u jien.
I did more than that	Għamilt aktar minn hekk
That you are not.	Li m'intix.
But in fact, it’s not so much.	Imma fil-fatt, mhuwiex daqshekk hekk.
I can eat something too	Jien ukoll nista' niekol xi ħaġa
I want you to know that	Irrid li tkun taf dan
I hope this was something I was willing to do	Nispera li din kienet xi ħaġa li kont lest tagħmel
I will never tell anyone what happened	Qatt mhu se ngħid lil ħadd x’inhu jiġri
She wasn’t here yesterday nor today.	Ma kinitx hawn ilbieraħ u lanqas illum.
There are many.	Hemm ħafna.
Before you do anything else.	Qabel ma tagħmel ħaġa oħra.
You are with me now.	Int miegħi issa.
I wasn’t here, he had said	Jien ma kontx hawn, kien qal
I want to know the truth	Irrid inkun naf il-verità
That’s what happened to me actually.	Hekk ġara lili fil-fatt.
I was glad she was here tonight	Kont ferħan li kienet hawn illejla
He is not here now.	Huwa mhux hawn issa.
It's nothing.	Mhu xejn.
I have to really go now.	Ikolli verament immur issa.
I couldn't understand what it was	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien
On and off !.	Fuq u barra!.
Just what he knows, or doesn’t know yet.	Biss dak li jaf, jew għadu ma jafx.
I didn't want anyone to know that	Ma ridt li ħadd ikun jaf b’dan
It was fun.	Kien gost.
That is more or less what he said.	Dan huwa xi ftit jew wisq dak li qal.
I did everything he told me	Għamilt dak kollu li qalli
I can't speak right now	Ma nistax nitkellem bħalissa
But so it was.	Imma hekk kien.
I think it does a better job	Naħseb li tagħmel xogħol aħjar
Someone already lives there.	Xi ħadd diġà jgħix hemm.
I need to know the truth	Għandi bżonn inkun naf il-verità
The problem I have.	Il-problema jien.
I didn’t want to take that long	Ma ridtx nieħu daqshekk żmien
I had a pretty good job.	Kelli xogħol pjuttost tajjeb.
I just wanted to do better than some people	Ridt biss nagħmel aħjar minn xi nies
I can do something for you	Nista’ nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik
I have to be afraid.	Għandi nibża.
I think it will be so	Naħseb li se jkun hekk
They were many.	Kienu ħafna.
It's pretty good.	Huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
He will be back home soon.	Dalwaqt ikun lura d-dar.
I should have known that	I kellha naf li
It does.	Jagħmel.
I didn’t know how to go back	Ma kontx naf kif immur lura
I never want that to anyone	Qatt ma nixtieq dak lil ħadd
I was actually thinking that	Fil-fatt kont qed naħseb hekk
Nothing for me.	Xejn għalija.
You never will.	Inti qatt ma se.
That's what happens.	Hekk jiġri.
This is not so here.	Dan mhux hekk hawn.
I knew how much you want something like that	Kont naf kemm trid xi ħaġa bħal dik
It was so bad that there was no one else out there.	Tant kien ħażin li ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor barra.
I want to tell you everything	Irrid ngħidlek kollox
You seem to be.	Inti tidher li tkun.
It's pretty big.	Huwa pjuttost kbir.
He didn’t need to think for a long time.	Ma kellux bżonn jaħseb għal żmien twil.
That seems easy enough.	Li jidher faċli biżżejjed.
It hadn’t happened just once.	Ma kienx ġara darba biss.
I came last.	Ġejt l-aħħar.
I thought he wanted to know	Ħsibt li jrid ikun jaf
I have to go for that now	Għandi mmur għal dak issa
You do what you have to do.	Inti tagħmel dak li għandek tagħmel.
And too small.	U żgħir wisq.
To tell the truth, always	Ngħid il-verità, dejjem
I just wanted to think that something had happened	Ridt biss li jaħseb li ġara xi ħaġa
I had had enough of that.	Jien kelli biżżejjed minn hekk.
It would be wrong.	Ikun ħażin.
He plans to go back.	Qed jippjana li jmur lura.
That he shouldn't have.	Li ma kellux ikollu.
She knows.	Hija taf.
I have to do what he says	Ikolli nagħmel dak li jgħid
I didn’t need to talk to him	Ma kellix bżonn nitkellem miegħu
I didn’t want to be alone again	Ma ridtx inkun waħdi mill-ġdid
I had to happen once	Kelli li jiġri darba
But here are a few things.	Imma hawn ftit affarijiet.
He didn't have to.	Ma kellux.
You must too.	Int trid ukoll.
But it was hard to say for sure.	Imma kien diffiċli li tgħid żgur.
Not for many years.	Mhux għal ħafna snin.
He wants to know what's going on.	Irid ikun jaf x'qed jiġri.
And that was the truth.	U dik kienet il-verità.
We did this last night.	Dan għamilna lbieraħ filgħaxija.
Few have this.	Ftit għandhom dan.
I never did anything wrong.	Qatt ma għamilt xi ħaġa ħażina.
I think it’s great	Naħseb li huwa kbir
There were no people around, that was for sure.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda nies madwar, li kien ċert.
I thought we were maybe more than friends	Ħsibt li konna forsi aktar minn ħbieb
In fact I did none.	Fil-fatt ma għamilt l-ebda.
Obviously I don’t know.	Ovvjament ma nafx.
You'll make friends.	Int ser tagħmel ħbieb.
I didn’t want to think about school right now	Ma ridtx naħseb dwar l-iskola bħalissa
It may or may not be.	Jista', jew jista' ma jkunx.
I have to.	Ikolli.
They are.	Huma .
No, you are not ready.	Le, m'intix lest.
It’s the only way it works.	Huwa l-uniku mod kif jaħdem.
It's been a long time coming.	Ilu żmien twil ġej.
Not quite there.	Mhux pjuttost hemm.
Something seems wrong	Xi ħaġa tidher ħażina
We did nothing.	Aħna ma għamilna xejn.
I couldn't.	Ma stajtx.
I know what will happen	Naf x'se jiġri
The latter has been the truth.	Din l-aħħar kienet il-verità.
It will probably be evening.	Huwa probabbilment jiġi filgħaxija.
We need to do a better job than this.	Irridu nagħmlu xogħol aħjar minn dan.
Nobody knows who he is.	Ħadd ma jaf min hu.
Maybe it wasn’t there.	Forsi ma kienx hemm.
He was very young.	Kien żgħir ħafna.
I don’t know how to be.	Ma nafx kif inkun.
A good friend like any other can ever have	Ħabib tajjeb bħal kull qatt jista' jkollu
I see I wanted to say something	Nara li ridt tgħid xi ħaġa
But this is not difficult.	Imma dan mhux diffiċli.
I said, but it wasn't me	għidt, imma ma kienx minni
I couldn't believe it	Jien ma stajtx nemmen
If he did, he would have to do it.	Kieku kien, kien ikollu jagħmel dan.
There is a time.	Hemm żmien.
This will be the same.	Dan se jkun l-istess.
She will be back.	Hija ser tkun lura.
Here we were both.	Hawn konna t-tnejn.
I’m very, very tired.	Jien għajjien ħafna, ħafna.
It has never been so difficult.	Qatt ma kien daqshekk diffiċli.
Everything is working fine and normally.	Kollox qed jaħdem tajjeb u normalment.
I can see why.	Nista’ nara għalfejn tagħmel hekk.
I would say he is, but he is not.	Nixtieq ngħid li hu, imma mhux.
I was so scared.	Kont tant nibża.
For once he had nothing to say.	Għal darba ma kellu xejn xi jgħid.
You have to do what you want.	Trid tagħmel kif trid.
They are both doing the same job.	It-tnejn qed jagħmlu l-istess xogħol.
He really didn't have to.	Huwa verament ma kellux.
He doesn’t seem worried.	Ma jidhirx inkwetat.
I have never been able to do such a thing	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel ħaġa bħal din
I still don't understand	Għadni ma nifhem
This is what they do.	Dan huwa dak li jagħmlu.
He told me he didn’t love me anymore.	Huwa qalli li ma kienx iħobb miegħi aktar.
I like that, she says	Inħobb hekk, tgħid
He said he knew and he would.	Qal li kien jaf u kien se.
He wants it that way.	Huwa jrid hekk.
That was early.	Dak kien kmieni.
In fact, he was never really sure of many.	Fil-fatt, qatt ma kien verament ċert minn ħafna.
Most likely, she will be there.	Ħafna probabbli, hi tkun hemm.
But it is very late.	Imma huwa tard ħafna.
There must be something.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa.
But we don't have time.	Imma m’għandniex ħin.
I was there to do that.	I kien hemm li sar dak.
But it often doesn’t.	Imma ħafna drabi ma jagħmilx hekk.
How to speak.	Kif titkellem.
I knew what was coming	Kont naf x’kien ġej
I have to do everything myself	Ikolli nagħmel kollox jien
And there is no other way.	U m'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor.
It’s not always there, but it comes and goes.	Mhux dejjem hemm, imma tiġi u tmur.
I need a little.	Għandi bżonn ftit.
This we need.	Dan għandna bżonn.
I’ve seen it coming from here.	Stajt nara li ġej minn hawn.
I haven't even been back	Lanqas stajt lura
If he comes, he will survive.	Jekk tiġi, hu jgħix.
I hope you do better.	Nispera li tagħmel aħjar.
Able? 	Kapaċi?
I knew how that was	Kont naf kif kien dak
Forever forever.	Għal dejjem ta 'dejjem.
I thought they were what everyone should want	Ħsibt li kienu dak li kulħadd għandu jrid
It’s really hard to tell when you’re ready.	Huwa verament diffiċli li tgħid meta tkun lest.
And it never could be, it never was.	U qatt ma seta’ jkun, qatt ma kien.
I'm busy enough.	Jien okkupat biżżejjed.
I was tired of waiting and wanted to go now	Kont għajjien nistenna u ridt immur issa
Something was wrong.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
Nothing will happen.	Xejn mhu se jiġri.
I didn’t want to go home	Ma ridtx immur id-dar
I’m having fun here.	Qed nieħu gost hawn.
But not quite.	Imma mhux pjuttost.
I may have been like this before, but not anymore	Seta’ kont hekk qabel, imma mhux aktar
I didn’t have to wait.	Ma kellix għalfejn nistenna.
I know it was hard for you	Naf li kien diffiċli għalik
I can't go there anymore	Ma nistax immur hemm aktar
It's not that big.	Mhuwiex daqshekk kbir.
We are together tonight.	Aħna flimkien illejla.
Later that morning.	Aktar tard dak filgħodu.
It's not good.	Mhuwiex tajjeb.
I couldn’t believe it.	Ma stajtx nemmen.
But not until then.	Imma mhux sa dak iż-żmien.
Obviously, he’s not.	Ovvjament, hu mhux.
It must be very difficult for him.	Għandu jkun diffiċli ħafna għalih.
And so they felt.	U hekk ħassu.
I'm ready here.	Jien lest hawn.
It wasn’t that easy.	Ma kienx daqshekk faċli.
I will expect a happy man	Jien se nistenna raġel ferħan
I haven’t been one for quite some time.	Jien ma kontx wieħed għal żmien pjuttost twil.
I'm definitely interested	Jien żgur interessat
Just more.	Biss aktar.
I think I did really well	Naħseb li għamilt tassew tajjeb
I can't understand how	Ma nistax nifhem kif
But they are.	Imma huma.
I need you to be here for me	Għandi bżonn li tkun hawn għalija
Nothing was going well.	Xejn ma kien sejjer tajjeb.
She was here.	Kienet hawn.
I can't believe it was him	Ma nistax nemmen li kien hu
But this is not a big problem.	Imma din mhix problema kbira.
I just want to be able to eat	Irrid biss inkun nista' niekol
He sat down and started eating.	Poġġa bilqiegħda u beda jiekol.
They are not alone.	Mhux huma biss.
I need to know something	Għandi bżonn inkun naf xi ħaġa
I know nothing.	Jien ma naf xejn.
I'm fine.	Jien tajjeb.
Not sure.	M'intix ċert.
I have to think about that	Għandi naħseb fuq dan
For you and for him.	Għalik u għalih.
I needed to talk to him	Kelli bżonn nitkellem miegħu
That we will not do.	Dak mhux se nagħmlu.
All right.	Kollox tajjeb.
Someone else, someone else.	Xi ħadd ieħor, xi ħadd ieħor.
It’s the same yesterday, today and forever.	Hu l-istess ilbieraħ, illum u għal dejjem.
I wasn't sure why.	Ma kontx ċert għaliex.
What she was doing.	Dak li kienet tagħmel.
Together it makes almost everyone.	Flimkien li jagħmel kważi kulħadd.
Everyone went out of their way to work.	Kulħadd ħareġ minn kollox biex jaħdem.
He needed to be alone.	Huwa kellu bżonn ikun waħdu.
I still can't go back	Għadni ma stajtx immur lura
On and.	Fuq u.
But that was really good for me	Imma dan kien tassew tajjeb għalija
I look forward to this	Qed nistenna dan ħażin
It was probably good.	Probabbilment kien tajjeb.
As you know.	Kif taf.
I was just wondering	Kont biss qed nistaqsi
Not a little bit.	Mhux ftit ftit.
I never did, either	Jien qatt ma, lanqas
That was what he wanted.	Dan kien dak li ried.
But it was her.	Imma kienet hi.
He plays with everything or alone.	Huwa għandu ma 'kollox jew waħdu.
Just a few hours.	Biss ftit sigħat.
You say nothing to anyone, not to one person.	Tgħid xejn lil ħadd, mhux lil persuna waħda.
I will see this later	Se nara dan aktar tard
I need to go home now, not later	Għandi bżonn immur id-dar issa, mhux aktar tard
He should not be worried about it.	Huwa m'għandux ikun inkwetat dwar dan.
I’m sure everything you do will be great	Jiena ċert li kull ma tagħmel se jkun kbir
It will be a while.	Se jkun ftit żmien.
I was going	Jien kont immur
This is too much.	Dan huwa wisq.
There she is.	Hemm hi.
I hope this helps someone else.	Nittama li dan jgħin lil xi ħadd ieħor.
I wasn’t sure what to do	Ma kontx ċert x'se nagħmel
And he wanted that.	U ried dan.
I want to be with you all the time	Irrid inkun miegħek il-ħin kollu
Not everyone knows everything about everything.	Mhux kulħadd jaf kollox dwar kollox.
Everything else works.	Kollox ieħor jaħdem.
I'm really happy to be here	Jien tassew kuntent li nkun hawn
This is a lot to expect from a single man.	Dan huwa ħafna li wieħed jistenna minn raġel wieħed.
I was going to take this	Kont se nieħu dan
It’s something you don’t want to do.	Hija xi ħaġa li ma tridx tagħmel.
I have already done the work.	Diġà għamilt ix-xogħol.
He was sure he was very happy to be home.	Huwa żgur li kien kuntent ħafna li kien id-dar.
We had to go there.	Kellna mmorru hemm.
There is a problem with this.	Hemm problema b'dan.
That’s when it got really bad.	Dak hu meta sar tassew ħażin.
Just very, very hard.	Biss ħafna, diffiċli ħafna.
I’m supposed to do that.	Jien suppost nagħmel hekk.
There is one there.	Hemm wieħed hemm.
This will probably happen quite a bit.	Dan probabbilment se jiġri pjuttost ftit.
See what happens	Nara x’qed jiġri
I thought I wasn’t going to do that	Ħsibt li ma kontx se tagħmel dan
I couldn’t have done better now.	Jien ma stajtx nagħmel aħjar issa.
I'm not much anymore.	Jien ma tantx aktar.
Now, let’s go.	Issa, ejja mmorru.
I’m just trying to understand things.	Jien biss nipprova nifhem l-affarijiet.
More on that soon.	Aktar dwar dan dalwaqt.
This may be all that is needed.	Dan jista 'jkun dak kollu li hemm bżonn.
Who can speak.	Min jista’ jitkellem.
I believe nothing.	Nemmen xejn.
Wrong.	Ħażin.
I did nothing for you or me	Jien ma għamilt xejn għalik jew għalija
There is no other way to do it.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor biex tagħmel dan.
I like it easy.	Jien inħobb faċli.
And another.	U ieħor.
But look.	Imma ħares.
I’m not too sure about anything else	M'inix wisq ċert dwar xi ħaġa oħra
He’s waiting for me, of course.	Huwa jistenna lili, ovvjament.
That's out there.	Li hawn barra.
In the morning, he.	Filgħodu, hu.
Try to think of what he will do tomorrow.	Ipprova jaħseb x’kien se jagħmel għada.
That was wrong too.	Dak kien ħażin ukoll.
That came pretty early.	Li wasal pjuttost kmieni.
I had to believe you were okay	Kelli nemmen li int tajjeb
It's still there.	Għadu hemm.
Sure, look at both.	Żgur, ħares lejn it-tnejn.
It couldn't have been more helpful.	Ma setax kien aktar ta’ għajnuna.
Not everyone knows this.	Mhux kulħadd jaf dan.
I’m not sure it would be today.	M'inix ċert li kieku llum.
I was never there	Qatt ma kont hemm
That's enough of it.	Dan huwa biżżejjed ta 'dan.
I never did that	Qatt ma għamilt dan
You know what makes me.	Taf dak li jagħmel lili.
I was so glad for him	Kont tant ferħan għalih
So be it.	Hekk ukoll jekk ikun.
I couldn’t think of it	Ma stajtx naħseb dwarha
From what I heard.	Minn dak li smajt.
I’ve loved it before	Jien kont inħobb qabel
I was glad to see that	Kont ferħan nara dan
It was really easy for me to do that.	Għalija kien tassew faċli li nagħmel dan.
Our time has come.	Wasal iż-żmien tagħna.
I didn't go shopping	Jien ma mort nixtri
It should be a good time !.	Għandu jkun żmien tajjeb!.
He needs help.	Huwa għandu bżonn l-għajnuna.
She was not alone there.	Ma kinitx waħedha hemmhekk.
That wasn’t me.	Dik ma kontx lili.
But it always seemed good to be here.	Imma dejjem deher tajjeb li jkun hawn.
Nor was I anymore	Lanqas ma kontx aktar
I wasn’t able to, I had to go shopping	Ma kontx kapaċi, kelli mmur nixtri
And before anyone says anything.	U qabel ma xi ħadd jgħid xejn.
And we can go now.	U nistgħu mmorru issa.
I think something will happen.	Naħseb li se jiġri xi ħaġa.
It seems to be going very well.	Jidher li sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
I will always be good to you	Inkun tajjeb miegħek dejjem
He said there was nothing.	Qal li ma kien hemm xejn.
Everything seems to work well with him.	Jidher li kollox jaħdem tajjeb miegħu.
You never know.	Qatt ma tkun taf.
Not just once, but many times.	Mhux darba biss, imma ħafna drabi.
He wanted to come home.	Ried jiġi d-dar.
He had a lot of friends around.	Huwa kellu ħafna ħbieb madwar.
But it was not as bad as it could have been.	Imma ma kienx ħażin daqskemm seta’ jkun.
I know I haven’t been around these much before	Naf li ma kontx madwar dawn ħafna qabel
Obviously it's better.	Ovvjament huwa aħjar.
.	.
You know, about what I said last night.	Taf, dwar dak li għedt ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
It seems so.	Huwa hekk jidher.
I was doing exactly the same.	Kont qed nagħmel eżatt l-istess.
I just wanted to know what it was	Ridt biss inkun naf x’kien
I had no way to	Ma kelli l-ebda mod biex
It still appears.	Għadu jidher.
Its time has come.	Wasal iż-żmien tiegħu.
But not for that.	Imma mhux għal dan.
Or not.	Jew le.
I don’t know anyone like that.	Jien ma naf lil ħadd hekk.
It does.	Dan jagħmel dan.
When the time comes.	Meta jkun il-ħin.
I will go but he wants to stay	Jien se mmur imma jrid jibqa’
It's just you and me.	Huwa biss int u jien.
She says she wasn't.	Tgħid li ma kinitx.
In fact no one seems to know exactly where he was.	Fil-fatt ħadd ma jidher li jaf eżatt fejn kien.
He was not going to survive this.	Ma kienx se jgħix dan.
About what he knew.	Dwar dak li kien jaf.
I just think he’s a lot happier now	Naħseb biss li huwa ħafna aktar ferħan issa
I just want you to think about it.	Irrid biss li taħseb dwar dan.
This will be more difficult.	Dan se jkun aktar diffiċli.
If so, you're in for a treat.	Jekk hekk, int għal ħafna xogħol.
I can take a lot more	Nista' nieħu ħafna aktar
I know this is really hard for you	Naf li dan huwa tassew diffiċli għalik
We would have known before.	Kieku konna nafu qabel.
Maybe around noon.	Forsi madwar nofsinhar.
I wasn't talking to you	Jien ma kontx qed nitkellem miegħek
It was a great idea	Kienet idea kbira
I knew you weren't happy	Kont naf li int m’intix kuntent
But they will never do that.	Imma qatt mhu se jagħmlu dan.
And you can.	U tista’.
I wanted to talk about it	Ridt ngħid dwarha
I have no idea what this is	M'għandi l-ebda idea dwar x'inhu dan
I see nothing more.	Ma nara xejn aktar.
Some are afraid that it will not be there.	Ftit jibża’ li mhux se jkun hemm.
I wasn’t able to understand why this is yet.	Ma kontx kapaċi nifhem għaliex dan għadu.
He did a very good job.	Huwa għamel xogħol tajjeb ħafna.
I wasn’t expecting much when it came out	Ma kontx qed nistenna ħafna meta ħareġ
I want to talk about it	Irrid nitkellem dwarha
It does better.	Hija tagħmel aħjar.
Not very big, not small.	Mhux kbir ħafna, mhux żgħir.
This is a good thing for me right now.	Din hija ħaġa tajba għalija bħalissa.
You can't be sure.	Ma tistax tkun ċert.
You can tell by how much he loves his job.	Tista’ tgħid kemm iħobb ix-xogħol tiegħu.
I couldn’t do anything about it	Ma stajt nagħmel xejn dwar dan
It was really bad.	Kien tassew ħażin.
I think you want to know	Naħseb li trid tkun taf
I couldn't be here anymore	Ma stajtx inkun hawn aktar
I think it was too late.	Naħseb li kien tard wisq.
In fact, she probably did.	Fil-fatt, hija probabbilment għamlet.
He needs me a lot.	Huwa għandu bżonn kbir minni.
I can’t believe this is happening	Ma nistax nemmen li dan qed jiġri
Or what.	Jew dak.
I needed to talk about both.	Kelli bżonn nitkellem dwar it-tnejn.
Not even that.	Lanqas dan biss.
He didn’t know how to do it.	Ma kienx jaf kif jagħmel dan.
I understand what this is	Nifhem x'inhu dan
She wasn’t going to go.	Ma kinitx se tmur.
Neither are they.	Lanqas huma.
Someone should know.	Xi ħadd għandu jkun jaf.
I want to be good enough	Irrid inkun tajjeb biżżejjed
I didn't know what was going on	Ma kontx naf aktar x’qed jiġri
She was watching for him.	Hija kienet qed tara għalih.
I think we should just go	Naħseb li għandna mmorru biss
It has never happened before.	Qatt ma ġara qabel.
I’ve never seen the same thing before or after	Qatt ma rajt l-istess qabel jew wara
He just left.	Huwa biss telaq.
I think she's fine.	Naħseb li hi tajjeb.
No more, he says.	Mhux aktar, jgħid.
I had to think about it	Kelli naħseb dwar dan
I think you will be happy	Naħseb li tkun kuntent
He really couldn't.	Huwa verament ma setax.
I wasn’t very good at sitting down	Ma kontx tajjeb ħafna biex noqgħod bilqiegħda
And so it had to be.	U hekk kellu jkun.
I want to be with you forever	Irrid inkun miegħek għal dejjem
But it got better.	Imma mar aħjar.
There are people here.	Hemm nies hawn.
I thought no one would ever know for sure	Ħsibt li ħadd qatt ma kien se jkun jaf żgur
I know you needed time to think	Naf li kellek bżonn iż-żmien biex taħseb
He was going to do something wrong.	Kien se jagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina.
I’m sure there will be a few.	Jien ċert li jkun hemm ftit.
If it was.	Jekk kien.
Maybe we don't.	Forsi m’għandniex.
I don’t know another way to go.	Ma nafx mod ieħor biex immur.
It's not.	Huwa le.
I’m supposed to be seeing something.	Jien suppost qed nara xi ħaġa.
I didn’t think it was that bad	Ma kontx naħseb li kienet daqshekk ħażina
How long ago.	Kemm ilu.
It makes everyone the same.	Jagħmel lil kulħadd l-istess.
But that’s years from now.	Imma dak huwa snin minn issa.
Maybe he did.	Forsi hekk għamel.
It could be any.	Jista 'jkun xi wieħed.
I knew it was time to get out again	Kont naf li kien wasal iż-żmien li nerġa’ nerġa’ nerġa’ barra
There is no way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod.
I have no idea what happened	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'kien ġara
No, otherwise about.	Le, mod ieħor dwar.
It's something else.	Hija xi ħaġa oħra.
That was pretty hard	Dak kien pjuttost diffiċli
Whenever it was.	Kull meta kien.
It can't be seen.	Ma tistax tidher.
Try again.	Ipprova għal darba oħra.
And there is much more.	U hemm ħafna aktar.
Seems like a good thing.	Jidher ħaġa tajba.
I want him to leave	Irrid li jitlaq
But if that happens of course you are telling the truth.	Imma jekk jiġri hekk ovvjament int tgħid il-verità.
This may take some time	Dan jista 'jkun xi żmien
He was trying to be helpful.	Kien qed jipprova jkun ta’ għajnuna.
But if he wanted to.	Imma kieku ried.
Something was very wrong.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina ħafna.
It was just too much for him today	Kien ftit wisq għalih illum
Now, that will do it.	Issa, li se tagħmel dan.
I did both.	Għamilt it-tnejn.
I believe this is what happened	Nemmen li dan huwa dak li ġara
That was my husband.	Dak kien raġel tiegħi.
No one lives alone.	Ħadd ma jgħix waħdu.
He does what he wants to do.	Jagħmel dak li jrid jagħmel.
I'm not going.	Jien mhux sejjer.
It’s getting better, you know.	Huwa sejjer aħjar, taf.
Everything for him.	Kollox għalih.
I never thought it would ever happen to me	Qatt ma ħsibt li qatt se jiġri għalija
I just wanted to sit down	Ridt biss noqgħod bilqiegħda
I think you can say that	Naħseb li tista’ tgħid hekk
Worth going.	Ta’ min imur.
I just want to know something happens.	Irrid biss li tkun taf xi ħaġa jiġri.
I wanted to be the one to tell you	Jien ridt inkun jien li ngħidlek
I eat there all the time	Jien niekol hemm il-ħin kollu
By now, maybe.	Sa issa, forsi.
I think you are too	Naħseb li int ukoll
But nothing was as bad as that.	Imma xejn ma kien ħażin daqs dan.
I want to know what happened.	Irrid inkun naf x’ġara.
They never should.	Huma qatt ma għandhom.
I just didn’t want to talk about it	Jien biss ma ridtx nitkellem dwar dan
I really didn't want to go	Verament ma ridtx immur
It would be easier for us.	Ikun aktar faċli għalina.
Something no one can really say.	Xi ħaġa li ħadd ma jista’ verament jgħid.
Looks like nothing ever happened.	Qisu qatt ma ġara xejn.
Really, really good work.	Xogħol tassew, tassew tajjeb.
And there must be things there.	U jrid ikun hemm affarijiet hemmhekk.
He needed some help.	Huwa kellu bżonn xi għajnuna.
He had to do it.	Kellu jagħmel dan.
I didn’t think anything about it.	Jien ma ħsibt xejn dwarha.
We know nothing about where he is from.	Ma nafu xejn dwar minn fejn hu.
I saw everything, but I wasn’t here	Rajt kollox, imma ma kontx hawn
I wasn’t ready for that	Jien ma kontx lest għal dan
Everyone wants things.	Kulħadd irid l-affarijiet.
I can prove it.	Jien nista' nipprova dan.
I think that’s something else	Naħseb li dik hija xi ħaġa oħra
I knew exactly where I was going	Kont naf eżatt fejn sejjer
He had us.	Kellu magħna.
I can’t talk about it anymore	Ma nistax nitkellem aktar dwar dan
I was good with him	Jiena kont tajjeb miegħu
I think, sooner or later he knew	Naħseb, illum jew għada kien jaf
I don’t want to talk about it.	Ma rridx nitkellem dwarha.
I had to be.	Kelli nkun.
I didn’t want to appear	Ma ridtx tidher
This is a beautiful thing.	Din hija ħaġa sabiħa.
I was happy enough with this	Kont ferħan biżżejjed b'dan
I didn’t want to talk about it	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwarha
He was just a boy.	Kien biss tifel.
This is not an easy thing to think about.	Din mhix ħaġa faċli biex taħseb.
I did well.	Jien għamilt tajjeb.
I’ve never seen anything like that	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal dik
Everyone had to leave.	Kulħadd kellu jitlaq.
There was only one chance.	Kien hemm ċans wieħed biss.
Now I know this was never going to work	Issa naf li dan qatt ma kien se jaħdem
I believe he wanted us to be together	Nemmen li ried għalina nkunu flimkien
Probably she does.	Probabbilment hi tagħmel.
He was all about it	Huwa kien kollu dwar dan
Or rather, because it will never happen.	Jew aħjar, għaliex qatt mhu se jiġri.
I just need some money.	Għandi bżonn biss ftit flus.
No one is left alone here for long!	Ħadd ma jibqa’ waħdu hawn għal żmien twil!.
I knew it wouldn’t be the last	Kont naf li mhux se jkun l-aħħar
I couldn't say anything	Ma stajt ngħid xejn
I went to eat	Mort niekol
I did nothing	Jien ma għamilt xejn
And he really wasn’t scared.	U verament ma kienx jibża.
He never had.	Qatt ma kellu.
I’ve been able to see this forever	Jien stajt nara dan għal dejjem
I have a hard time eating	Għandi diffiċli biex niekol
I see who a person is	Nara min hi persuna
I didn’t want to think about it, right now	Ma ridtx naħseb dwar dan, bħalissa
You are not a bad person.	M'intix persuna ħażina.
I want to know what's wrong with him	Irrid inkun naf x'inhu ħażin miegħu
You can go too.	Tista’ tmur ukoll.
He was going home.	Kien sejjer id-dar.
I haven't been so happy in a long time	Ilni ma kontx hekk kuntent
But she is.	Imma hi.
Now it belonged to everyone.	Issa kienet ta’ kulħadd.
I understand that this can be a difficult time	Nifhem li dan jista’ jkun żmien diffiċli
He looks like a good man.	Jidher qisu raġel tajjeb.
They will not do that.	Huma mhux se jagħmlu dan.
But he was happy.	Imma kien kuntent.
That was about the book.	Dak kien dwar il-ktieb.
I see you have his dog	Nara li għandek il-kelb tiegħu
He seemed to be the first of many.	Deher li kien l-ewwel minn ħafna.
There is nothing else worth taking.	M'hemm xejn ieħor ta 'min jieħu.
I didn’t have long to wait	Ma kellix twil nistenna
I'm not sure why	M'inix ċert għaliex
I want to know more about it	Irrid inkun naf aktar dwarha
I'll tell you later	Jien ngħidlek aktar tard
You are not here.	M'intix hawn.
He never said anything.	Qatt ma qal xejn.
He must have.	Huwa għandu jkollu.
They were just doing what most people do.	Kienu biss jagħmlu dak li jagħmlu ħafna nies.
I have to say it really does a good job	Irrid ngħid li verament tagħmel ix-xogħol tajjeb
That wasn’t much for me.	Li ma kienx ħafna għalija.
I never had.	Qatt ma kelli.
I saw you, boy, and you are alone	Rajt int, tifel, u int waħdek
Not you and yours, or me and mine.	Mhux int u tiegħek, jew jien u tiegħi.
He seems to have wanted more.	Jidher li ried aktar.
I hadn’t heard any of this stuff before	Ma kont smajt xejn minn dan l-affarijiet qabel
This is quite long.	Dan huwa pjuttost twil.
I don't have time to do that right now	Bħalissa m'għandix il-ħin biex nagħmel dan
And so it would be.	U hekk ikun.
I will say one thing for him	Jien se ngħid ħaġa waħda għalih
I have to be on one or the other	Għandi nkun fuq waħda jew oħra
We know who she is.	Nafu min hi.
I think I’m doing this wrong.	Naħseb li qed nagħmel dan ħażin.
I think this is pretty big.	Naħseb li dan huwa pjuttost kbir.
She doesn’t seem to be.	Hija ma jidhirx li kienet.
I look forward to it.	Nistenna hekk.
I'm back here now.	Jien lura hawn issa.
I think you already know	Naħseb li inti diġà taf
I wasn’t trying much	Ma kontx qed nipprova ħafna
I couldn’t take it anymore	Ma stajtx nieħu aktar
You can do that too.	Tista 'tagħmel dan ukoll.
It is very easy to do.	Huwa faċli ħafna li tagħmel.
I knew there was something wrong with me	Kont naf li kien hemm xi ħaġa ħażina miegħi
It wasn’t that hard to do everything he did.	Ma kienx daqshekk diffiċli li tagħmel dak kollu li għamel.
Which is great.	Li huwa kbir.
It was never there.	Qatt ma kien hemm.
I need to do this, I always have to	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan, dejjem għandi
I mean, you can, but you can't.	Nixtieq ngħid li tista’ imma ma tistax.
A few times, maybe	Ftit drabi, forsi
And not for long, not forever.	U mhux għal żmien twil, mhux għal dejjem.
It’s the same, maybe.	Huwa l-istess, forsi.
It was long enough.	Kien twil biżżejjed.
Now? 	Issa?
I need some help out here.	Għandi bżonn xi għajnuna hawn barra.
Everyone has one.	Kulħadd għandu wieħed.
It was never needed.	Qatt ma kien hemm bżonn.
I eat and eat and eat	Jien niekol u niekol u niekol
This always happens.	Dan dejjem jiġri.
To see, he thought.	Biex tara, ħaseb.
A person did something wrong	Persuna għamlet xi ħaġa ħażina
There are a few of this as well.	Hemm xi ftit minn dan ukoll.
I never knew a beautiful one	Qatt ma kont naf waħda sabiħa
I’m not going to talk about that	Jien mhux se nitkellem fuq dan
All of them, in fact.	Kollha kemm huma, fil-fatt.
I knew it was just then	Kont naf li kien eżatt dak iż-żmien
Like a child, he was.	Bħal tifel, kien.
Someone has, but not him.	Xi ħadd għandu, imma ma jkunx hu.
But another was not.	Imma ieħor ma kienx.
The book does that, and more.	Il-ktieb jagħmel dan, u aktar.
I know that one too.	Jien naf dak wieħed ukoll.
I didn’t want to think about it	Ma ridtx naħseb dwar dan
That was hard.	Dak kien diffiċli.
For hours and hours	Għal sigħat u sigħat
It will be, too.	Se jkun, ukoll.
I just heard about it	Smajt biss dwarha
I want to talk to you more	Irrid nitkellem miegħek aktar
Neither did I	Lanqas jien ma kontx
I can’t wait for it to come.	Ma nistax nistenna sakemm jiġi.
Not everyone was happy.	Mhux kulħadd kien kuntent.
I never thought I would actually do that	Qatt qatt ma ħsibt li fil-fatt tagħmel dan
I think this is a good thing.	Naħseb li din hija ħaġa tajba.
I needed something more	Jien kelli bżonn xi ħaġa aktar
Can you tell me why you did this?	Tista’ tgħidli għaliex għamilt dan.
I do the same.	Jien nagħmel l-istess.
Something was very wrong here.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina ħafna hawn.
But you are not.	Imma m'intix.
Maybe it wasn’t such a good idea after all.	Forsi ma kinitx idea daqshekk tajba wara kollox.
I would have been fine on my own	Jien kont inkun tajjeb waħdi
No, she wasn't really there.	Le, ma kinitx verament hi.
There is too much to say.	Hemm wisq xi tgħid.
He looks tired again.	Huwa jidher għajjien mill-ġdid.
It doesn’t seem to work well.	Ma jidhirx li jaħdem tajjeb.
I’m not out of this	Jien mhux barra minn dan
And you know what it does.	U inti taf li jagħmel.
I definitely didn’t want to.	Żgur li ma ridtx.
I can't even talk to anyone about it	Lanqas nista’ nitkellem ma’ ħadd dwar dan
I could understand very well	Stajt nifhem tajjeb ħafna
We had had enough.	Kellna biżżejjed.
I knew she was going to do something	Kont naf li kienet se tagħmel xi ħaġa
Now here’s my problem.	Issa hawn il-problema tiegħi.
He knows nothing more about anything.	Ma jaf xejn aktar dwar xejn.
Now come on, with me.	Issa ejja, miegħi.
I think it could be.	Naħseb li jista’ jkun.
Just for a few hours.	Biss għal ftit sigħat.
He never left early.	Qatt ma telaq kmieni.
Someone is coming back.	Xi ħadd ġej lura.
Very, very tired.	Għajjien ħafna, ħafna.
I'm not helping you right now	M'iniex għajnuna għalik issa
How to do it.	Kif tagħmel dan.
Easy is good.	Faċli hija tajba.
It’s all you want it to be.	Huwa dak kollu li trid li tkun.
Now it was late.	Issa kien tard.
I have money.	Għandi flus.
But that's it.	Imma dak hu.
I was hoping you might want to come along	Kont nittama li forsi trid tiġi flimkien
I know you have to do it	Naf li għandek tagħmel dan
He became my friend.	Sar ħabib tiegħi.
I think that's a good thing	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba
No, not maybe.	Le, mhux forsi.
He did so.	Huwa għamel hekk.
There are a lot of people.	Hemm ħafna nies.
I am still today	Għadni llum
I'll tell you later.	Ngħidlek aktar tard.
Maybe you do.	Forsi inti tagħmel.
You want to know the truth.	Trid tkun taf il-verità.
Maybe it was all too much.	Forsi kien kollu wisq.
He had to wait for this.	Huwa kellu jistenna dan.
I can't go back.	Ma nistax immur lura.
I’ve always loved that house	Dejjem kont inħobb dik id-dar
He didn’t know what to do anymore.	Ma kienx jaf x'għandu jagħmel aktar.
I didn’t want to, you know, like that	Ma ridtx, taf, bħal hekk
I always have and always will	Dejjem għandi u dejjem se
I never knew anyone good who wasn’t.	Qatt ma kien jaf xi ħadd tajjeb li ma kienx.
Tomorrow may be good too.	Għada jista 'jkun tajjeb ukoll.
I have never heard of this	Qatt ma smajt dwar dan
That would have been the case.	Dan kien ikun hekk.
Work probably.	Ix-xogħol probabbilment.
I can't believe it's happening so fast, but it's beautiful.	Ma tantx nista’ nemmen li qed jiġri daqshekk malajr, imma hija sabiħa.
I wasn’t there	Jien ma kontx hemm
I saw and I saw	Rajt u rajt
He has that.	Huwa għandu dak.
And it's a great one.	U hija waħda kbira.
I'm more scared than you ever know	Jien nibża’ aktar milli qatt tista’ tkun taf
That wasn’t good at all.	Dak ma kien tajjeb xejn.
He left with nothing.	Telaq mingħajr xejn.
I will say no more.	Jien se ngħid mhux aktar.
Just because, he didn’t know.	Biss għaliex, ma kienx jaf.
I am good to be alone	Jiena tajjeb li nkun waħdi
Not for anyone.	Mhux għal ħadd.
I just wonder if it was enough	Nistaqsi biss jekk kienx biżżejjed
I don’t expect any of this to go well	Ma nistenna li xejn minn dan imur tajjeb
Here was a chance.	Hawn kien ċans.
Today I went back to school	Illum mort lura l-iskola
I’m not ready for that.	Jien mhux lest għal dan.
I thought it might be	Ħsibt li tista’ tkun
He was dead.	Kien miet.
I was just going to say	Kont biss se ngħid
He was the only man there.	Kien l-uniku raġel hemmhekk.
But it actually happens often.	Imma fil-fatt jiġri spiss.
I want to have a good time today	Irrid nagħmel ħin tajjeb illum
He says no.	Jgħid le.
Not so much today.	Mhux daqshekk illum.
Every single person out there.	Kull persuna waħda hemmhekk.
Always do and always have.	Dejjem jagħmlu u dejjem għandna.
But that's just me.	Imma dak jien biss.
I had no idea they were capable of this	Ma kellix idea li kienu kapaċi għal dan
I don’t know if you do.	Ma nafx jekk tagħmilx.
I really wasn’t there	Jien verament ma kontx hemm
Otherwise.	Mod ieħor.
I hadn’t thought about it for a long time.	Ma kontx ħsibt dwarha għal żmien twil.
I’m not hoping to do well	Mhux qed nittama li nagħmel tajjeb
After a while he sat down.	Wara ftit poġġa.
I was thinking the same thing	Kont qed naħseb l-istess ħaġa
That’s how much time you have.	Dak hu kemm għandek ħin.
Needless to say.	M'għandekx għalfejn tgħid aktar.
Much more than that.	Ħafna aktar minn hekk.
I believe it will.	Jien nemmen li se.
I was a very, very, very bad boy	Kont tifel ħażin ħafna, ħafna, ħafna
I knew this well	Jiena kont naf tajjeb dan
I don’t think anyone really knows.	Ma naħsibx li xi ħadd verament jaf.
One bad one.	Waħda ħażina.
And not a bad thing.	U mhux xi ħaġa ħażina.
You know, the one who died.	Taf, dak li miet.
I think that’s all we need.	Naħseb li dak kollu li għandna bżonn.
No one else will.	Ħadd ieħor ma se.
Well, that was it.	Ukoll, kien beda dan.
I think you want to be tired	Naħseb li trid tkun għajjien
I can't have that	Ma nistax ikolli dan
I'm not a bad person	Jien mhux persuna ħażina
I have nowhere else to go	M'għandi fejn immur ieħor
But it never does.	Imma qatt ma jagħmel.
I love him so much	Jien tant inħobb miegħu
I hear things to.	Nisma affarijiet biex.
I'm not going with you.	Jien mhux immur miegħek.
Lots of fun.	Ħafna gost.
I won't talk anymore	Mhux se nitkellem aktar
It's been a few years.	Ilu ftit snin.
He knew it could be wrong.	Huwa kien jaf li jista 'jiġi ħażin.
That was it.	Dak kien.
No, there was nothing he needed.	Le, ma kien hemm xejn li kellu bżonn.
When everything is too much.	Meta kollox ikun wisq.
I just couldn't do it	I biss ma stajtx tagħmel dan
I heard everything.	Smajt kollox.
Okay, let me tell you something.	Tajjeb, ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
You are coming back.	Inti ġej lura.
And that’s good of me.	U dak tajjeb minni.
Tell me.	Tgħidli.
I have already seen all this	Diġà rajt dan kollu
I just wanted to go home and be alone	Ridt biss immur id-dar u nkun waħdi
I don't know what's going to happen.	Ma tantx naf x’se jiġri.
I just wanted to know	Ridt biss li tkun taf
I think it will be good	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb
I think you don’t want to talk anymore	Naħseb li ma tridx titkellem aktar
Who we are is good.	Min aħna huwa tajjeb.
I still had no idea who she was.	Għadni ma kellix idea min kienet.
I was too backward.	Kont wisq lura.
I wasn’t going to ask.	Ma kontx se nistaqsi.
I will have to go back to that	Ikolli nerġa' lura għal dak
I didn’t say anything at the time.	Jien ma għidt xejn dak iż-żmien.
That’s not a good idea either.	Dik mhix idea tajba lanqas.
A little of that, a little of that	Ftit minn dan, ftit minn hekk
He needed this on.	Huwa kellu bżonn dan fuq.
And so are we.	U hekk aħna.
I hadn’t really thought about it.	Ma kontx verament ħsibt.
I can't wait any longer	Ma nistax nistenna aktar
I never had much of a problem with it	Qatt ma kelli ħafna problema miegħu
He said he was not surprised.	Qal li ma kienx sorpriż.
But obviously that wasn’t the problem.	Imma ovvjament dik ma kinitx il-problema.
I have to do the same.	Għandi nagħmel l-istess.
You don't think anything can go wrong.	Taħseb li xejn ma jista’ jmur ħażin.
I believe you are right	Nemmen li għandek raġun
I still think he can play.	Għadni naħseb li jista' jkollu.
It was something to do.	Kienet xi ħaġa li tagħmel.
You have a problem.	Għandek problema.
I think, maybe, it should be too much	Naħseb, forsi, għandu jkun wisq
I’m going to do anything, anything you want.	Jien ser nagħmel kull ħaġa, kull ħaġa li trid.
No one did anything.	Ħadd ma għamel xi ħaġa.
I wish one could say more.	Nixtieq li wieħed jista' jgħid aktar.
Maybe the first time he ever thought so.	Forsi l-ewwel darba li qatt ħaseb hekk.
I know so little about this	Naf daqshekk ftit minn dan
I wish he could come with us.	Nixtieq li seta’ jiġi magħna.
A man like that can't help it	Raġel bħal dak ma jistax jgħin
I will go back with you	Jien se mmur lura miegħek
I still don't.	Għadni ma.
And so I did.	U hekk għamilt.
It may take longer.	Jista' jieħu aktar żmien.
I want to know what it is	Irrid inkun naf dak li hu
A little of that	Ftit minn dan
I'm not what you think	Jien mhux dak li taħseb
I want to be there	Nixtieq li tkun hemm
Yours as well as mine.	Tiegħek kif ukoll tiegħi.
I knew there was but	Kont naf li kien hemm imma
I couldn't see anyone	Ma stajt nara lil ħadd
If you want.	Jekk trid.
You are alone.	Int waħdek.
He is a child only.	Huwa tifel biss.
It couldn’t be that this was happening.	Ma setax ikun li dan kien qed jiġri.
There is no way to go about this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod kif wieħed imur madwar dan.
He probably had a son by now.	Probabbilment kellu tifel sa issa.
It took a while.	Ħa ftit ħin.
But he is too busy.	Imma hu okkupat wisq.
Something great.	Xi ħaġa kbira.
But it’s all over.	Imma huwa minn kollox.
Maybe it wasn’t.	Forsi ma kienx.
I want to be happy again	Irrid inkun kuntent mill-ġdid
He didn't want anyone to talk.	Ma ried lil ħadd jitkellem.
We, we, we.	Aħna, aħna, aħna.
No, please no.	Le, jekk jogħġbok le.
No one wants that.	Ħadd ma jrid hekk.
I think you could really be anything	Naħseb li inti tista 'verament tkun xi ħaġa
I have to go back a little	Għandi nagħmel lura ftit
I'm not you anymore	Jien m'iniex int aktar
I couldn't understand what was happening to him	Ma stajtx nifhem x’qed jiġri miegħu
I want time to think	Irrid ħin biex naħseb
This seems to have been done.	Dan jidher li sar.
He and and.	Huwa u u.
He was not worried.	Hu ma kienx inkwetat.
You have to do it.	Għandek tagħmel dan.
I was hoping I wasn’t, but you are	Kont qed nittama li ma kontx, imma int
I'm just never.	Jien biss qatt.
I already know how to do the job	Diġà naf kif nagħmel ix-xogħol
It's a problem.	Hija problema.
You stay home.	Inti toqgħod id-dar.
He told me he had.	Huwa qalli li kellu.
It just happens.	Jiġri biss.
I really can’t say enough about everything and everyone	Tassew ma nistax ngħid biżżejjed dwar kollox u fuq kulħadd
we know that.	nafu li.
Almost nothing happened.	Kważi xejn ma ġara.
It had been a long time.	Huwa kien ilu żmien twil.
It may never come.	Jista’ qatt ma jiġi.
There was money.	Kien hemm flus.
I didn’t want to know any more.	Ma ridtx inkun naf aktar.
Now was not the time.	Issa ma kienx iż-żmien.
I will not go back there	Jien mhux se mmur lura hemm
He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Ma ried jitkellem, ma’ ħadd.
They were one.	Kienu wieħed.
I was never the same.	Qatt ma kont l-istess.
Very good for us.	Tajjeb ħafna għalina.
I know it’s been a long time	Naf li ilu żmien twil
Who, or whatever it was.	Min, jew dak kollu li kien.
I enjoy both.	Jien nieħu gost it-tnejn.
I think that’s what it is.	Naħseb li huwa dak li hu.
It was home.	Kienet id-dar.
This is another one.	Din hija waħda oħra.
I know how it was	Naf kif kien
In fact, I was happy to be home	Fil-fatt kont kuntent li nkun id-dar
I haven't seen my house in a while	Ilni ma nara d-dar tiegħi għal xi żmien
I thought about that too	Ħsibt dwar dan ukoll
I will not be home tonight	Jien mhux se nkun id-dar, illejla
I think you are too.	Naħseb li int ukoll.
Or must have.	Jew għandu jkollu.
I need to believe that you can do it	Għandi bżonn nemmen li inti tista 'tagħmel dan
He was expecting that.	Huwa kien jistenna li.
I know this can happen to you	Naf li jista’ jiġri miegħek
I know it’s a small one	Naf li huwa wieħed żgħir
He said nothing.	Ma qal xejn.
I never asked anyone	Qatt ma kont nistaqsi lil ħadd
That was it.	Dan kien.
I was glad he went through that.	Kien ferħan li għadda minn hekk.
No, not a car.	Le, mhux karozza.
I knew all this obviously	Jien kont naf dan kollu ovvjament
He made sure of that.	Huwa għamel ċert minn dan.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
Or someone else.	Jew lil xi ħadd ieħor.
I really hope it goes well	Verament nittama li jkun tajjeb
I didn’t want that.	Jien ma ridtx hekk.
I didn’t tell anyone about it	Jien ma għedt lil ħadd dwarha
I was too young and everything happened quickly	Kont żgħir wisq u kollox ġara malajr
I couldn't tell you that	Ma stajtx ngħidlek dan
I tell you it’s good.	Jien ngħidlek li huwa tajjeb.
One for him, one for me, he said.	Waħda għalih, waħda għalija, qal.
I can't tell you where.	Ma nistax ngħidlek fejn.
Nothing like this.	Xejn bħal dan.
He was glad.	Kien ferħan.
I should have seen something	I kellha rajt xi ħaġa
I’ve seen it all, really	Stajt nara dan kollu, tassew
I want everything back	Irrid kollox lura
I'll tell you what happens.	Jien ngħidlek x’inhu jiġri.
It probably won’t be too big.	Probabbilment mhux se jkun kbir wisq.
I did it there in the morning.	Għamilt filgħodu hemm.
That's not bad.	Dak mhux ħażin.
He can't do anything.	Ma jistax jagħmel x’inhu.
Everything will be fine.	Kollox se jkun tajjeb.
It's easy to see why	Huwa faċli li wieħed jara għaliex
I really needed to go shopping	Verament kelli bżonn immur nixtri
I will try to do that today.	Jien ser nipprova nagħmel minn hekk illum.
I still can’t believe it’s happening.	Għadni ma nistax nemmen li qed jiġri.
I have a lot to say.	Għandi ħafna xi ngħid.
Nobody knows what will happen.	Ħadd ma jaf x’se jiġri.
I was so glad she was doing this	Kont tant kuntent li kienet qed tagħmel dan
Tired a few other times.	Għajjien xi ftit drabi oħra.
I hope he knows what he’s doing	Nispera li jaf x'qed jagħmel
It is not supposed to be so.	Mhux suppost tkun hekk.
She needed that.	Hija kellha bżonn dan.
Never be the same, do something like that.	Qatt ma tkun l-istess, tagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din.
That’s what a man wants to do.	Dak hu li jrid jagħmel raġel.
I was able to stay for hours	Stajt noqgħod għal sigħat
A little bit.	Ftit ftit.
Just a little.	Ftit biss.
This is pretty easy.	Din hija pjuttost faċli.
I didn’t know better	Ma kontx naf aħjar
It should be here, but it's too late.	Għandu jkun hawn, imma wasal tard.
I need to do something	Għandi bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa
Maybe the first time.	Forsi l-ewwel darba.
Sorry to hear about all this.	Jiddispjaċini nisma' dwar dan kollu.
Now he knew he had to play.	Issa kien jaf li kellu jkollu.
This was done without my knowledge.	Dan sar mingħajr ma naf jien.
There was only her.	Kien hemm hi biss.
He won't.	Hu mhux se.
If ever there was a time.	Jekk qatt kien hemm żmien.
There it was, that was enough.	Kien hemm, dan kien biżżejjed.
He doesn't want to.	Ma jkunx irid.
I did the same.	Għamilt l-istess.
But it looks good.	Imma jidher li hu tajjeb.
Don't make it big.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan kbir.
It's not that hard.	Mhuwiex daqshekk diffiċli.
I need to talk to you	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek
Nobody is small.	Ħadd ma huwa ta’ daqs żgħir.
I didn’t say anything back	Jien ma għedt xejn lura
I want to go tomorrow	Irrid immur għada
It would be good.	Ikun tajjeb.
And no.	U mhux.
Everyone has had this problem for some time.	Kulħadd kellu din il-problema xi żmien.
He was a great man.	Kien raġel kbir.
But no one knows what will happen.	Imma ħadd ma jaf x’se jiġri.
He usually couldn't see anything.	Ħares normalment ma seta’ jara xejn.
Or maybe someone else will.	Jew forsi xi ħadd ieħor se.
And he was gone.	U kien mar.
I don’t know about that.	Ma nafx dwar dan.
I’m pretty sure he did his week.	Jien pjuttost ċert li għamel il-ġimgħa tiegħu.
I think you should know	Naħseb li għandek tkun taf
I thought back.	Ħsibt lura.
I'm going to need your help	Jien ser ikolli bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek
Everyone wants to say his.	Kulħadd irid jgħid tiegħu.
I just want to go back.	Irrid biss lura.
I wasn’t sure	Jien ma kontx ċert
I would like to know what happened.	Nixtieq inkun naf x'ġara.
I couldn’t think.	Ma stajtx naħseb.
Not my problem.	Mhux il-problema tiegħi.
I was trying to tell you	Kont qed nipprova ngħidlek
Of something.	Ta’ xi ħaġa.
But you don't have to.	Imma m'għandekx.
I wasn’t now.	Jien ma kontx issa.
I’ve been sitting there for hours	Stajt noqgħod hemm għal sigħat
That would be great.	Dak ikun kbir.
He doesn’t know how to try anymore.	Ma jafx kif jipprova aktar.
That’s good for that one.	Dak tajjeb għal dak wieħed.
But not for me.	Imma mhux għalija.
No one has been here for a long time.	Ħadd mhu hawn għal żmien twil.
You have been.	Int ġejt.
Not yet	Għadni ma tantx
I can't say no.	Ma nafx ngħid le.
She had no time.	Ma kellha l-ebda ħin.
I didn’t even know who she was	Lanqas kont naf min kienet
That’s what happens here.	Dak hu li jiġri hawn.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
It would be really hard.	Ikun verament diffiċli.
There has to be how.	Irid ikun hemm kif.
You are not.	M'intix.
I know I did.	Naf li għamilt.
I want to do this for him	Irrid nagħmel dan għalih
I didn’t hear anything back.	Jien ma smajt xejn lura.
I needed to know where to go	Kelli bżonn inkun naf fejn għandi mmur
He never came back.	Hu qatt ma ġie lura.
I had never been here	Qatt ma kelli ġejt hawn
I wasn’t just interested	Jien ma kontx interessat biss
Have some fun.	Tieħu ftit gost.
A little more.	Ftit aktar.
I can’t say more about it	Ma nistax ngħid aktar dwarha
No, it won't.	Le, mhux se.
I wanted to come from behind.	Ridt ġej minn wara.
That would be something.	Dik kienet tkun tassew xi ħaġa.
I returned more	I lura aktar
I was just going to say	Kont se ngħid biss
He took it and came back.	Huwa ħa u ġie lura.
He needed to go.	Kellu bżonn imur.
He was never able to.	Qatt ma kien kapaċi.
Everyone does.	Kulħadd jagħmel.
I’m going to talk to him now.	Immur nitkellem miegħu issa.
Everything was working	Kollox kien jaħdem
I no longer knew what to believe	Ma kontx naf aktar x'se nemmen
I was going to do this in the afternoon	Kont se nagħmel dan wara nofsinhar
I did, if you like.	Jien għamilt, jekk tixtieq.
I wasn’t very helpful.	Ma kontx ħafna għajnuna.
In fact, you are going with us.	Fil-fatt, int sejjer magħna.
I'm always here for you	Jien dejjem hawn għalik
We only know about everything about each other.	Nafu biss dwar kollox dwar xulxin.
I couldn't wait to tell you	Ma stajtx nistenna li ngħidlek
He was trying for you.	Kien qed jipprova għalik.
Right after.	Eżatt wara.
I was everything and everyone.	Jien kont kollox u kulħadd.
I can't talk anymore	Ma nistax nitkellem aktar
I didn’t have to think about it before	Ma kellix għalfejn naħseb dwarha qabel
He couldn't tell.	Ma setax jgħid.
I really didn’t need this now	I verament ma kellix bżonn dan issa
I had a great time.	Għamilt ħin tajjeb ħafna.
She wants to leave.	Hija trid li jitlaq.
He could do something	Seta’ jagħmel xi ħaġa
You are so tired.	Inti tant għajjien.
And there were too many.	U kien hemm wisq.
He will live, but he will not be the same again.	Hu se jgħix, imma mhux se jerġa’ jkun l-istess.
Everyone looked good.	Kulħadd deher tajjeb.
I said so to say this	Għidt hekk biex ngħid dan
I was watching from the outside	Jien kont qed nara minn barra
He needed to go home.	Kellu bżonn imur id-dar.
This I saw.	Dan rajt jien.
That was the only time we did that.	Dik kienet l-unika darba li għamilna hekk.
But there was no one.	Imma ma kien hemm ħadd.
No one came.	Ħadd ma ġie.
I always knew that	Dejjem kont naf li
She was right.	Kienet kellha raġun.
I wasn’t sure if it was good or bad	Ma kontx ċert jekk kienx tajjeb jew ħażin
I still don’t know how he did it.	Għadni ma nafx kif għamel dan.
I didn’t need to talk	Ma kellix bżonn nitkellem
I must have done something	I għandu għamilt xi ħaġa
I also have a problem	Jien ukoll għandi problema
Now was his time.	Issa kien iż-żmien tiegħu.
And so he did.	U hekk għamel.
It can be a long time.	Jista 'jkun żmien twil.
Sometimes it seems so.	Xi drabi jidher hekk.
Tomorrow may not be.	Għada jista 'ma jkunx.
For some things, it may be.	Għal xi affarijiet, jista 'jkun.
And it’s bad, bad, bad.	U huwa ħażin, ħażin, ħażin.
I just didn't have time	I biss ma kellix ħin
I am really sorry for what happened	Jien tassew jiddispjaċini għal dak li ġara
I want to make things better	Irrid nagħmel affarijiet aħjar
It could have been.	Seta’ kien.
But he didn’t seem interested.	Imma ma deherx interessat.
I couldn't go that far	Ma stajtx immur hekk
I knew what we needed	Kont naf dak li kellna bżonn
That’s what you want.	Dak hu li trid.
I have no idea if it's my back	M'għandi l-ebda idea jekk hux lura tiegħi
Not this last time.	Mhux din l-aħħar darba.
This is not so.	Dan mhux hekk.
Back, just enough.	Lura, ftit biżżejjed.
He will never leave.	Qatt mhu se jitlaq.
It was there.	Kien hemm.
This was never going to happen.	Dan qatt ma kien se jiġri.
Don't be so good to us.	Tkunx daqshekk tajba magħna.
It's later there.	Huwa aktar tard hemm.
I wonder what he was doing in my room	Nistaqsi x’kien qed jagħmel fil-kamra tiegħi
I didn't know what it was like then	Ma kontx naf x’kien dak iż-żmien
I didn’t know it was so bad.	Ma kontx naf li kien daqshekk ħażin.
And he had a way with his.	U kellu mod ma tiegħu.
I have a hard time understanding this.	Għandi diffiċli nifhem dan.
It's not much.	Mhuwiex ħafna.
Well, he was.	Ukoll, hu kien.
I need to know why she was doing this	Għandi bżonn inkun naf għaliex hi kienet tagħmel dan
It could be anything.	Jista 'jkun xi ħaġa.
Say, see how it goes.	Tgħid, tara kif tmur.
I’m sorry for that but that’s not about it.	Jiddispjaċini għal dan imma dan mhux dwar dan.
He goes with you wherever you go.	Huwa jmur miegħek kull fejn tmur.
I will never do that again	Jien qatt mhu se nerġa’ nagħmel dan
I was thinking a little more about it last night	Kont qed naħseb ftit aktar dwarha lbieraħ filgħaxija
There never seemed to be enough.	Qatt ma deher li kien hemm biżżejjed.
I have to think.	Ikolli naħseb.
I don't really understand what's going on.	Ma tantx nifhem x’qed jiġri.
I am very happy with that.	Jien kuntent ħafna b'dan.
But it was no better.	Imma ma kienx aħjar.
But no.	Imma le.
I think she knows	Naħseb li hi taf
I haven’t been there a few years now	Ilni ma kont hemm ftit snin issa
I didn’t want that	Jien ma ridtx hekk
This I say to many people	Dan ngħid lil ħafna nies
She wants, wants.	Hi trid, trid.
There were many.	Kien hemm ħafna.
I hope it isn’t.	Nispera li ma jkunx.
But it won't.	Imma mhux se.
I was pretty bad there at work	Kont pjuttost ħażin hemmhekk fuq ix-xogħol
I can't understand why you stay with him	Ma nistax nifhem għaliex inti toqgħod miegħu
One can be just about anything	Wieħed jista 'jkun biss dwar xi ħaġa
I hope he still thinks so	Nispera li għadu jaħseb hekk
I like it so much	Nixtieq hekk ħafna
I'll tell you something else	Ngħidlek xi ħaġa oħra
We knew it was there.	Konna nafu li kien hemm.
Not an easy one.	Mhix waħda faċli.
But this is what I wanted.	Imma dan huwa dak li ridt.
There was no need to listen.	Ma kienx hemm bżonn li nisma’.
I had to believe that he could	Kelli nemmen li jista’
Until now.	Sa issa.
Maybe it will this week.	Forsi se din il-ġimgħa.
I believe he is.	Nemmen li hu.
I love who you are now	Inħobb min int issa
Come on! 	Ejja!
we have to go back.	irridu mmorru lura.
I don't like it.	Jien ma nħobbx.
I can’t wait any longer.	Ma nistax nistenna aktar.
But he was not happy.	Imma ma kienx ferħan.
There is nothing like it out there.	M'hemm xejn ieħor bħal dan hemmhekk.
There is something about it.	Hemm xi ħaġa dwarha.
And it’s time to know as well.	U wasal iż-żmien li tkun taf ukoll.
I wonder what else is going on.	Nistaqsi x'qed jiġri aktar.
I need to know who did this	Għandi bżonn inkun naf min għamel dan
I'm not out.	I mhux barra.
But it wasn’t her.	Imma ma kinitx hi.
He hadn’t even thought about it since he left.	Hu lanqas biss ħaseb dwarha minn meta telaq.
There we have a few friends.	Hemmhekk għandna ftit ħbieb.
I shouldn’t be seeing this	M'għandix inkun nara dan
I knew she wasn't going to do that either	Jien kont naf li lanqas ma kienet se tagħmel dan
I need it a lot.	Għandi bżonn ħafna.
I didn’t know I was sure.	Ma kontx naf li kont żgur.
It was not good to go there.	Ma kienx tajjeb li tmur hemm.
I couldn't think anymore	Ma stajtx naħseb aktar
Obviously not here.	Ovvjament mhux hawn.
No, she's yours, my friend.	Le, hi tiegħek, ħabib tiegħi.
Or do, but not interested.	Jew jagħmel, imma mhux interessat.
She always had something to say.	Dejjem kellha xi tgħid.
I didn't think so	Ma kontx ħsibt hekk
I’m not going to do anything, or anyone	Jien mhux se nagħmel xejn, jew lil xi ħadd
Or not a man.	Jew mhux raġel.
Well, pretty good.	Ukoll, pjuttost tajjeb.
I could tell I didn't want to go	Jien stajt ngħid li ma riedx immur
It’s the same for you.	Huwa l-istess għalik.
Good to talk to you.	Tajjeb nitkellem miegħek.
Much to say.	Ħafna xi ngħid.
Maybe ready after all.	Forsi lest wara kollox.
I know he is telling the truth	Naf li jgħid il-verità
I knew it was going to happen	Kont naf li se jiġri
I just need a little more	Għandi bżonn biss ftit aktar
She wasn’t what he wanted.	Hija ma kinitx dak li ried.
I don’t want to be wrong.	Ma rridx inkun ħażin.
This is pretty easy to see.	Dan huwa pjuttost faċli biex tara.
I had to tell you all this	I kellha ngħidlek dan kollu
As it should be.	Kif kellu jkun.
Good for everyone.	Tajjeb għal kulħadd.
It was me there.	Kien jien hemmhekk.
He wanted to know.	Ried ikun jaf.
And they usually do.	U normalment jagħmlu.
Just have fun.	Tieħu gost biss.
I can't tell you how much.	Ma nistax ngħidlek kemm.
I can tell there	Nista 'ngħid hemmhekk
I did this one.	Għamilt dan wieħed.
I want to tell someone	Irrid ngħid lil xi ħadd
I did this from time to time	Dan għamilt minn żmien għal żmien
I couldn’t believe he was doing this	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien qed jagħmel dan
I know what you are thinking now.	Naf x'qed taħseb issa.
He never wanted anything else.	Hu qatt ma ried xi ħaġa oħra.
I'm so good.	Jien daqshekk tajjeb.
That would be something if you had the time.	Dik tkun xi ħaġa li kieku kellek il-ħin.
Someone doesn’t do that.	Xi ħadd ma jagħmilx dan.
That he did.	Li għamel.
I’ve always been, too	Jien dejjem kont, ukoll
It was a little too late.	Kien ftit tard wisq.
I had no idea how long he had been there	Ma kellix idea kemm kien ilu hemm
But surviving is all he will do.	Imma jgħix huwa dak kollu li se jagħmel.
This was his home.	Din kienet id-dar tiegħu.
I didn’t want to talk to him anymore	Ma ridtx nitkellem miegħu aktar
But he seemed such a great man.	Imma deher raġel daqshekk kbir.
She can do anything	Hija tista 'tagħmel xejn
I know too well	Naf wisq tajjeb
That is saying a lot.	Li qed tgħid ħafna.
I am no more.	Jien m'iniex aktar.
It always works well.	Huwa dejjem jaħdem tajjeb.
I wish it was harder	Nixtieq li kien aktar diffiċli
I need to do this on my own	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan waħdi
There is our first.	Hemm l-ewwel tagħna.
Pretty good actually.	Pjuttost tajjeb fil-fatt.
I’m not saying anything about anything	Jien ma ngħid xejn dwar xejn
I was really tired last night	Ilbieraħ filgħaxija kont tassew għajjien
Most people do.	Ħafna nies jagħmlu.
We need to know better.	Għandna nkunu nafu aħjar.
I knew exactly where he was	Kont naf eżatt fejn kien
I'm not sure	Ma nafx żgur
I wasn't sure it was him	Ma kontx ċert li kien hu
I have had it many times.	Kelli ħafna darba.
But he went now.	Imma hu mar issa.
I can’t wait to see this	Ma nistax nistenna biex nara dan
Time to do some work.	Żmien li tagħmel xi xogħol.
He didn’t know how right he was.	Ma kienx jaf kemm kellu raġun.
This looks more like what you want.	Dan jidher aktar bħal dak li trid.
Now you are ready.	Issa inti lest.
I didn’t think it would be like that	Ma kontx naħseb li se jkun hekk
It was for me.	Kien għalija.
I wasn't ready yet	Għadni ma kontx lest
I was right to be.	Kelli raġun li nkun.
What he had he did not want.	Dak li kellu ma riedx.
I'm not afraid to do that	M'għandix nibża' nagħmel dan
All that work.	Dak ix-xogħol kollu.
I think it will be good.	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb.
I wanted to see everyone happy	Ridt nara lil kulħadd kuntent
I can see	Nista’ nara jien
I suspect this was an easy one	Nissuspetta li din kienet waħda faċli
It wasn’t that hard to do.	Ma kienx daqshekk diffiċli li tagħmel.
I know exactly who you are talking to	Naf eżatt fuq min qed titkellem
But it was good.	Imma kienet tajba.
Not one person.	Mhux persuna waħda.
I have mine.	Jien għandi tiegħi.
It could have been, but it wasn't.	Seta’ kien imma ma kienx.
I had no idea how long he was here	Ma kellix idea kemm kien hawn
I went there too	Jien mort hemm ukoll
I saw nothing more.	Ma rajt xejn aktar.
So far this is it.	Sa issa dan hu.
I have a job.	Għandi xogħol.
I didn’t have to talk about any of this	Jien ma kellix nitkellem dwar xejn minn dan
But we must not do that.	Imma dan m’għandniex nagħmlu.
I couldn't understand	Ma stajtx nifhem
I know what I did there was difficult	Naf li dak li għamilt hemmhekk kien diffiċli
I listen all the time	Nisma’ dak il-ħin kollu
You have to do it.	Għandek tagħmel dan.
She needed to do well.	Kellha bżonn tagħmel tajjeb.
I want to do that today too.	Irrid li tagħmel dan ukoll illum.
And he’s not a boy.	U hu mhux tifel.
Sometimes they didn’t even do that.	Xi drabi lanqas biss kienu jagħmlu dan.
You need both.	Għandek bżonn it-tnejn.
Obviously you are right.	Ovvjament għandek raġun.
Not only that.	Mhux biss.
I wanted to understand	Ridt nifhem
It could happen to anyone.	Seta’ jiġri lil xi ħadd.
I can't wait to be with you again	Ma nistax nistenna li nerġa' nkun miegħek
It was like.	Kien qisu.
I was young and I didn't know what to say	Kont żgħir u ma kontx naf x’se ngħid
It's just.	Huwa biss.
I know this now more than ever	Naf dan issa aktar minn qatt qabel
I never went to school with you	Jien qatt ma mort l-iskola miegħek
In fact, it looks so much better.	Fil-fatt, jidher ħafna aħjar.
First things first.	L-ewwel affarijiet l-ewwel.
She would.	Hi kieku.
But that didn’t go well either.	Imma dan lanqas ma mar tajjeb.
Or you can.	Jew tista '.
This is not what should happen.	Dan mhux dak li għandu jiġri.
Nothing, please nothing.	Xejn, jekk jogħġbok xejn.
It's coming.	Huwa ġej.
And so it does.	U hekk tagħmel.
I knew there was more.	Kont naf li kien hemm aktar.
I really hope you did	Verament nittama li għamilt
This cannot be happening.	Dan ma jistax ikun qed jiġri.
Here's some money.	Hawn xi flus.
We need more than that.	Għandna bżonn aktar minn dan.
I couldn't go back to myself	Ma stajtx immur lura għandi
I couldn't see where I was doing this	Ma stajtx nara fejn kont għamilt dan
I think you want to see things	Naħseb li trid tkun qed tara l-affarijiet
I think it should work.	Naħseb li għandu jaħdem.
I know being with him is really good	Naf li inti tkun miegħu huwa tassew tajjeb
Not you and me.	Mhux int u jien.
I just didn’t want anything to happen	Jien biss ma ridt li jiġri xejn
I know and hear things	Naf u nisma’ affarijiet
Well they don't.	Ukoll huma ma.
I hope there is a better way.	Nittama li hemm mod aħjar.
He knew all this but could not tell anyone.	Kien jaf dan kollu imma ma seta’ jgħid lil ħadd.
Things are much better.	L-affarijiet huma ħafna aħjar.
It makes out.	Jagħmel barra.
In fact, it should be your first.	Fil-fatt, għandu jkun l-ewwel tiegħek.
Good! 	Tajjeb!
I wasn't trying to listen	Jien ma kont qed nipprova nisma’ xejn
He was doing.	Kien qed jagħmel.
It didn’t look bad.	Ma deherx ħażin.
My time is all mine.	Il-ħin tiegħi huwa kollu tiegħi.
Not every time of course.	Mhux kull darba ovvjament.
They are more like people.	Huma aktar bħal nies.
She almost did.	Hija kważi għamlet.
I know yours.	Jien naf tiegħek.
I just saw it happen	Rajt biss jiġri
He wanted another.	Ried ieħor.
I didn’t know it at the time, but it was.	Dak iż-żmien ma kontx naf, imma hekk kien.
He played.	Huwa kellu.
In fact, they were just here.	Fil-fatt, kienu biss hawn.
He had to win.	Huwa kellu jirbaħ.
I still think about that.	Għadni naħseb dwar dak.
Maybe she was just a better person than me.	Forsi kienet biss persuna aħjar minni.
He must be.	Huwa għandu jkun.
It could be me.	Jista 'jkun jien.
I never had a chance.	Qatt ma kelli ċans.
You really are.	Int verament.
He had said too much.	Huwa kien qal wisq.
You can't.	Tista ma.
I can't be here with you	Ma nistax inkun hawn miegħek
And so it happened.	U hekk ġara.
He wanted to go.	Ried imur.
I couldn't hear or see	Ma stajtx nisma’ jew nara
I didn’t know who he was	Ma kontx naf min kien
They were there.	Kienu hemm.
It wasn’t what he needed.	Ma kienx dak li kellu bżonn.
I have no idea where it came from before	M'għandi l-ebda idea minn fejn ġie minn qabel
I'm out of it.	Jien barra minn dan.
I wasn’t so sure about that now	Ma kontx daqshekk ċert dwar dan issa
I would never have been able to do that.	Qatt ma kont inkun kapaċi nagħmel hekk.
I didn’t have much time	Ma kellix ħafna ħin
I said enough.	Għidt biżżejjed.
I'm glad you're here	Jien kuntent li qiegħed hawn
I would be back.	Inkun lura.
I need to do it again	Għandi bżonn li jerġa' jagħmel dan
The same.	L-istess.
But not much.	Imma mhux ħafna.
I can't understand why not now.	Ma nistax nifhem għaliex le issa.
I thought it was easy enough	Ħsibt li kien faċli biżżejjed
That’s not what works for me.	Dak mhux dak li jaħdem għalija.
He hadn't had one in years.	Kien ilu ma kellu wieħed minn snin.
I couldn't do that	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan
Or both.	Jew it-tnejn.
More than that.	Aktar minn hekk.
Much better than I would ever be able to do as well.	Ħafna aħjar milli qatt inkun kapaċi nagħmel ukoll.
Not even with you.	Lanqas miegħek.
That’s if it got that far.	Dak jekk wasal daqshekk.
It is today.	Huwa llum.
I can't tell you anything else	Ma nistax ngħidlek xi ħaġa oħra
I can't understand	Ma nistax nista' nifhem
I think he might know what to do	Naħseb li jista' jkun jaf x'għandu jagħmel
I know mine is forever.	Naf tiegħi huwa għal dejjem.
I just want you to be happy	Irrid biss li tkun ferħan
I have done this a few times	Dan għamilt xi ftit drabi
I had a little.	Kelli ftit.
I couldn't wait to see	Ma stajtx noqgħod nara
I want to have another chance.	Irrid ikolli ċans ieħor.
We know who should say things.	Nafu min għandu jgħid l-affarijiet.
How great is that!?.	Kemm ikun kbir dak!?.
I wasn't supposed to be here either	Lanqas suppost kont hawn
I'm not going to talk to you	Jien mhux se nitkellem miegħek
I do my thing and you do yours	Jien nagħmel ħaġa tiegħi u int tagħmel tiegħek
It is not working exactly.	Mhux qed jaħdem eżatt.
I really don’t think so.	Verament ma naħsibx.
I shouldn’t ask that	M'għandix nistaqsi hekk
I didn’t stand a chance.	Ma kellix ċans.
It was quick and easy.	Kien malajr u faċli.
I want to be surprised	Irrid inkun sorpriż
No more.	Mhux aktar.
I’m not doing that	Jien mhux qed nagħmel dan
That may have gone wrong.	Dak seta’ ħareġ ħażin.
Surely they felt that way.	Żgur li ħassu hekk.
You did nothing wrong.	Inti ma għamilt xejn ħażin.
He has just returned.	Huwa għadu kif ġie lura.
It was just the way things were.	Kien biss kif kienu l-affarijiet.
I used to say the same thing	Jien kont ngħid l-istess ħaġa
Something like that.	Xi ħaġa bħal dik.
From this he said	Minn dan ħareġ qal
I don’t think it will be his last.	Ma naħsibx li se jkun l-aħħar tiegħu.
I have something to say	Għandi xi ngħid
I wasn’t going to do much today	Illum ma kontx se nagħmel ħafna
At that time I was very young.	Dak iż-żmien kont żgħir ħafna.
It's not, of course.	Mhuwiex, ovvjament.
Something here was wrong.	Xi ħaġa hawn kienet ħażina.
I couldn’t wait to try one	Ma stajtx nistenna biex nipprova waħda
You can only come here to eat.	Tista’ tiġi hawn biss biex tiekol.
But not the same.	Imma mhux l-istess.
I don’t take anything	Jien ma nieħu xejn
Here, one last chance.	Hawn, l-aħħar ċans.
It will be my first time.	Se tkun l-ewwel darba tiegħi.
It seemed to take forever.	Deher li ħa għal dejjem.
Well, for everything.	Ukoll, għal kollox.
I did a good job there.	Jien għamilt xogħol tajjeb hemmhekk.
I wasn’t there at the time	Jien ma kontx hemm dak iż-żmien
He wanted to do more and see more and be more.	Ried jagħmel aktar u jara aktar u jkun aktar.
I want to do something else	Irrid nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra
But that has to wait.	Imma dak ikollu jistenna.
I think it would be a great, great thing.	Naħseb li tkun ħaġa kbira, kbira.
This will do nothing.	Dan mhu se jagħmel xejn.
I think it will be good for you	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb għalik
I knew I was out there	Kont naf li kont hemm barra
We knew where you were.	Konna nafu fejn int.
I had a lot of time yesterday	Kelli ħafna ħin ilbieraħ
I couldn't understand everything he was saying	Ma stajtx nifhem dak kollu li kien qed jgħid
But nothing else is, quite.	Imma xejn ieħor huwa, pjuttost.
I need to talk to you.	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek.
I never wanted to know	Qatt ma ridt inkun naf
I haven’t done anything about it for a while.	Jien ma għamilt xejn dwarha għal xi żmien.
Lots of things here	Ħafna affarijiet hawn
I know how he is.	Naf kif hu.
I don't have to be here	M'għandix għalfejn inkun hawn
They are doing things.	Qed jagħmlu affarijiet.
I hope not three years	Jien nittama li mhux tliet snin
I’m not sure about that.	M'inix ċert minn dan.
I thought that was it	Ħsibt li dan kien
I will not go back with you	Jien mhux se mmur lura miegħek
Unless you're one too.	Sakemm int wieħed ukoll.
It could be wrong.	Jista 'jkun ħażin.
What he is saying today.	Dak li qed jgħid illum.
Not just me.	Mhux lili biss.
I think they all do a good job	Naħseb li kollha jagħmlu xogħol tajjeb
I still think we are right	Għadni naħseb li għandna raġun
A very big man, but a man	Raġel kbir ħafna, imma raġel
And it works well.	U jaħdem tajjeb.
I knew I was coming.	Kont naf li ġejt.
He wanted to play too.	Ried jilgħab ukoll.
I knew we had done wrong	Kont naf li konna għamilna ħażin
I doubt you have much of your money	Niddubita li għandek ħafna flus tiegħek
That's exactly what happened.	Hekk ġara eżatt.
Not only that.	Mhux dan biss.
Definitely will	Żgur li se
The first is this.	L-ewwel huwa dan.
He sat down and started playing.	Poġġa bilqiegħda u beda jilgħab.
I never thought something like this would happen	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jiġri xi ħaġa bħal din
I need to try more	Għandi bżonn nipprova aktar
This should not happen.	Dan m'għandux jiġri.
I never did.	Jien qatt ma għamilt.
I can't do anything	Ma nista nagħmel xejn
I think she did a pretty good job	Naħseb li għamlet xogħol pjuttost tajjeb
It's not me.	M'intix jien'.
I really am, and I am years old	Jien tassew, u għandi snin
This is something you can do on your own.	Din hija xi ħaġa li tista 'tagħmel waħdek.
I will not be able to do that.	Jien mhux se nkun kapaċi nagħmel dan.
I thought you could say that	Ħsibt li tista’ tgħid hekk
I’m not going to settle for that.	Jien mhux se noqgħod għal dan.
But no, it wasn’t.	Imma le, ma kienx.
This will not happen.	Dan mhux se jiġri.
In fact, it wasn’t so bad.	Fil-fatt, ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
never sure what that is.	qatt ma ċert x'inhu dak.
I was surprised, though.	Kont sorpriż, imma.
You go about everything you would normally be doing.	Inti tmur dwar dak kollu li inti normalment tkun qed tagħmel.
You never know when it will happen.	Qatt ma tkun taf meta se jiġri.
It was great.	Kien kbir.
I really want to go home.	Verament irrid immur id-dar.
That was a great thing for him.	Din kienet ħaġa kbira għalih.
It's just not the same.	Huwa biss mhux l-istess.
I was hoping for something, but it came to nothing	Kont qed nittama għal xi ħaġa, imma ma ġie xejn
I've done better	Stajt għamilt aħjar
You should be there too.	Għandek tkun hemm ukoll.
This is who we are.	Dan hu min aħna.
I didn’t know why he was trying so hard	Ma kontx naf għaliex kien qed jipprova tant
I haven’t had anyone for so long	Jien ma kelli lil ħadd għal daqshekk żmien
You are not my friend.	M'intix ħabib tiegħi.
That’s what he was doing.	Huwa dak li kien jagħmel.
You have to sit down, ’he said.	Għandek toqgħod bilqiegħda,’ qal.
He was and with me.	Kien u miegħi.
No one is sure why.	Ħadd mhu ċert għaliex.
We made it happen.	Għamilna li se jiġri.
I won't now.	Jien mhux se issa.
But that’s not about it.	Imma dan mhux dwar dan.
He knows how to play	Jaf jilgħab
You are more than you seem.	Int aktar minn dak li tidher.
Look out the door.	Ħares barra lejn il-bieb.
It was still too early to be tired.	Kien għadu kmieni wisq biex tkun għajjien.
I'm so glad you are	Jien tant kuntent li int
That was what it was.	Kien dak li kien.
And it may not be for long.	U jista 'ma jkunx għal żmien twil.
I didn’t want to, ever again.	Ma ridtx, qatt aktar.
It looked like a lot.	Deher qisu ħafna.
I’ll try to do that later.	Jien ser nipprova nagħmel dan aktar tard.
But it may not be.	Imma jista 'ma jkunx.
She didn’t know who was there.	Ma kinitx taf min kien hemm.
He was waiting for this.	Kien qed jistenna dan.
You would not be better.	Inti ma tkunx aħjar.
I think you wanted that too.	Naħseb li inti ridt dan ukoll.
Everything looks great around here.	Kollox jidher kbir madwar hawn.
No more problems.	Mhux aktar problemi.
I should never have been happier	Jien ma kellix inkun kuntent qatt
I will ask about it again soon	Dalwaqt ser nistaqsi dwarha mill-ġdid
I wanted to go outside	Ridt immur barra
It's like this.	Huwa bħal dan.
But it is a great one.	Imma hija waħda kbira.
I was ready.	Jien kont lest.
I want to talk to you a little more	Irrid nitkellem miegħek ftit aktar
That's not enough.	Dak mhux biżżejjed.
And there’s a lot more to where it came from.	U hemm ħafna aktar minn fejn ġie.
Of course you can.	Ovvjament tista’.
I know I wasn't happy	Naf li ma kontx kuntent
I’ve heard him do that a few times	Kont smajt xi drabi li għamel hekk
This has only happened once.	Dan ġara darba biss.
I'm not sure.	m'inix ċert.
I think I will take one	Naħseb li se nieħu waħda
He looks like someone who knows.	Jidher qisu xi ħadd li jaf.
I can be like that too	Jien nista’ nkun hekk ukoll
She knew it was him.	Kienet taf li kien hu.
I didn’t know if it was going to work	Ma kontx naf jekk kienx se jaħdem
We can do better than that	Nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar minn hekk
That’s what he really loved.	Dak hu li verament iħobb.
I will do this later	Jien se nagħmel dan aktar tard
Maybe a little earlier.	Forsi ftit qabel.
I had to see that something was wrong	I kellha nara li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina
It was difficult.	Kienet diffiċli.
I have my first job.	Għandi l-ewwel xogħol tiegħi.
I wanted to do this because.	Jien ridt nagħmel dan għaliex.
I think it was better for him	Naħseb li kien aħjar għalih
Many things you can do.	Ħafna affarijiet li tista 'tagħmel.
I don't think we know for sure now	Naħseb li issa mhux se nkunu nafu żgur
Everything will go.	Dak kollu se jmur.
I can’t take more than that	Ma nistax nieħu aktar minn dan
I wasn’t trying anything on anyone	Jien ma kont qed nipprova xejn lil ħadd
It doesn't have to be a big deal.	M'għandux ikun xi ħaġa kbira.
So we were after.	Hekk konna wara.
He is who we are.	Huwa min aħna.
I can be anyone now	Jien nista' nkun xi ħadd issa
I wanted to know if anyone else was here	Ridt inkun naf jekk kienx hawn xi ħadd ieħor
I was having a hard time hearing	Kont qed ikolli ftit problemi biex nisma’
Needless to say.	M’għandux għalfejn jgħid ħafna.
I’m coming sooner than you think	Jien ġej aktar kmieni milli taħseb
That was what he was seeing.	Dan kien dak li kien qed jara.
Nobody knows, it just happens.	Ħadd ma jaf, jiġri biss.
I need time to think	Għandi bżonn ħin biex naħseb
I’ve done this before.	Jien għamilt dan qabel.
I don't even know why.	Lanqas naf għaliex.
I want to know who they are	Irrid inkun naf min huma
Anyone can do that.	Kulħadd jista 'jagħmel dan.
Look at this one.	Ħares lejn dan wieħed.
No, come on.	Le, ejja.
I did really well, actually	Jien għamilt tassew tajjeb, fil-fatt
I don't have time.	M'għandix żmien.
You will actually be helpful.	Int fil-fatt tkun ta’ għajnuna.
Good boy.	Tifel tajjeb.
That was about it.	Dik kienet dwarha.
He didn’t want that.	Huwa ma riedx dan.
She wants to eat again.	Hija trid tiekol mill-ġdid.
It's right there.	Huwa eżatt hemm.
And nothing happened.	U ma ġara xejn.
I really wanted to be a bad man	Verament ridt li tkun raġel ħażin
He told me there was no problem.	Huwa qalli li ma kienx hemm problema.
Which is what you want.	Li huwa dak li trid.
It wasn’t working at the time.	Dak iż-żmien ma kienx qed jaħdem.
But the same thing happened.	Imma ġara l-istess.
I have never been so happy	Qatt ma kont daqshekk kuntent
I know you have one	Naf li għandek waħda
What is happening outside of me is the same.	Dak li qed jiġri barra minni huwa l-istess.
I couldn't say anything else	Ma stajt ngħid xi ħaġa oħra
No one was anyone.	Ħadd ma kien ħadd.
It was no more.	Ma kienx aktar.
Or why not.	Jew għaliex le.
It happened, or it seemed to happen.	Ġara, jew deher li ġara.
I want to do what everyone wants	Irrid nagħmel dak li jrid kulħadd
This happens to many people.	Dan jiġri lil ħafna nies.
I didn’t know who she was	Ma kontx naf min kienet
I would like to do that	Nixtieq nagħmel hekk
I'm not sure how.	M'inix ċert kif.
You didn't tell me anything.	Inti ma qalli xejn.
It was a man who did this.	Kien raġel li għamel dan.
If there is anything else you need, just tell me.	Jekk hemm xi ħaġa oħra li għandek bżonn, għid biss.
I'm sure not either	Jien żgur lanqas
Whatever the job does.	Tkun xi tkun tagħmel ix-xogħol.
I am no more	Jien m'iniex aktar
I don't know what's going on.	Ma nafx x’qed jiġri.
No one else knows where we are, really.	Ħadd ieħor ma jaf fejn aħna, tassew.
I was not yet a small child	Ma kontx għadni tifel żgħir
I think everyone was just tired.	Naħseb li kulħadd kien biss għajjien.
I was always too tired	Dejjem kont għajjien wisq
It would be too small.	Ikun żgħir wisq.
I never thought about it that way	Jien qatt ma ħsibt dwarha hekk
I wanted to.	Jien ridt.
He has just arrived home.	Huwa għadu kif wasal id-dar.
But not too bad.	Imma mhux ħażin ħafna.
I know everything will work out for you	Naf li kollox se jaħdem għalik
I believe it shouldn’t	Nemmen li m'għandux
I just heard you say.	Smajt biss tgħid.
Everyone was home.	Kulħadd kien id-dar.
No, not so either.	Le, mhux hekk lanqas.
He’s not even here yet.	Huwa lanqas għadu hawn.
I'm not afraid of anything.	Jien ma nibża’ minn xejn.
He seems to have done so.	Jidher li għamel hekk.
I couldn’t say more.	Ma stajtx ngħid aktar.
I couldn't see how much he had	Ma stajtx nara kemm kellu
Like this is.	Bħal dan huwa.
I think she did a very good job	Naħseb li għamlet xogħol tajjeb ħafna
I'm not talking.	Jien ma nitkellem.
Which she always says now.	Li hija dejjem tgħid issa.
I speak the truth.	Jien nitkellem il-verità.
I couldn’t wait to hear this	Ma stajtx nistenna biex nisma dan
More on that later.	Aktar dwarha aktar tard.
I know exactly what happened.	Naf eżatt x'ġara.
I couldn't understand what was going on	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien qed jiġri
I think that’s a good thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba.
I can't do what he says	Ma nistax nagħmel dak li jgħid
Maybe she was telling the truth.	Forsi kienet qed tgħid il-verità.
But he couldn't tell.	Imma ma setax jgħid.
It wasn’t just not going back.	Ma kienx biss mhux sejjer lura.
I was going shopping	Kont immur nixtri
This is really great.	Dan huwa verament kbir.
I was wondering who you are	Kont qed nistaqsi min int
Look at yours as well.	Ħares lejn tiegħek ukoll.
No, he would never come, now.	Le, hu qatt ma kien jiġi, issa.
He's just there, waiting.	Huwa biss qiegħed hemm, jistenna.
I still have a chance	Għadni ċans
And you really don't need much.	U int verament m'għandekx bżonn ħafna.
But now it wasn't as it was going to be.	Imma issa ma kienx hekk kif kien se jkun.
I don’t like school here	Ma nħobbx l-iskola hawn
He plays well.	Huwa jilgħab tajjeb.
I was with you last night	Jien kont miegħek ilbieraħ filgħaxija
But that's just what he did.	Imma dan huwa biss dak li għamel.
Three years, it's a way.	Tliet snin, huwa mod.
No one else will be able to do that.	L-ebda persuna oħra ma tkun tista’ tagħmel dan.
I see now that it was	Nara issa li kien
None of this happened.	Xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet ma ġara.
It won't happen now, 'he said.	Mhux se issa,’ qal.
It wasn’t just him, either.	Ma kienx hu biss, lanqas.
Or too little.	Jew ftit wisq.
And so we will do that.	U hekk se nagħmlu dan.
He would not want to leave.	Ma jkunx irid jitlaq.
I will definitely buy more.	Żgur li se nixtri aktar.
I will always be there for you	Jien dejjem se nkun hemm għalik
At the back.	Fuq wara.
I thought I would be glad	Ħsibt li tkun ferħan
She wouldn’t want it that way.	Hija ma tkunx trid hekk.
Currently, this is what is happening.	Bħalissa, dan huwa dak li qed jiġri.
I knew it could never be	Kont naf li qatt ma seta’ jkun
Let me go back a few years.	Ħa mmur lura ftit snin.
Well, but they were.	Ukoll, imma kienu.
He needed to think.	Kellu bżonn jaħseb.
I knew that was it	Kont naf li din kienet dik
It never came to anything.	Qatt ma wasal għal xejn.
He never had.	Hu qatt ma kellu.
It’s working well for me.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb għalija.
I know you are tired.	Naf li inti għajjien.
I was there last night	Kont hemm ilbieraħ filgħaxija
I did nothing	Jien ma għamilt xejn
Only she really was.	Biss kien verament hi.
I know what's yours	Naf x'inhu tiegħek
Last time I had to be there	L-aħħar darba kelli nkun hemm
You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel dan jekk ma tridx.
I didn't think this could happen to us.	Ma kontx naħseb li dan jista’ jiġri għalina.
I heard I was going too	Smajt li kont sejjer ukoll
It wasn’t happening to me.	Ma kienx jiġri lili.
I am not a child anymore.	M'iniex tifel aktar.
I doubt it ever will	Niddubita li qatt se
I didn’t know what I was going to do with all this	Ma kontx naf x'se nagħmel minn dan kollu
But no more.	Imma mhux aktar.
I wasn’t supposed to be here last night	Jien ma kellix inkun hawn ilbieraħ filgħaxija
I wonder what he wants	Nistaqsi xi jrid
We have no problems.	M'għandniex problemi.
I hope you are interested	Nittama li inti interessat
I just have to	Ikolli biss
I know you wouldn't.	Naf li inti ma tkunx.
I look forward to it if this is better	Nistenna hawn jekk dan ikun aħjar
It's too late.	Wasal tard wisq.
And it was.	U kien.
I look forward to having a great year.	Nistenna li jkollu sena kbira.
Well, not all the time.	Ukoll, mhux il-ħin kollu.
He said he wasn't.	Qal li ma kienx.
And on for quite some time.	U fuq għal żmien pjuttost twil.
It was always him.	Dejjem kien hu.
I can't tell you that	Ma nistax ngħidlek hekk
I wish everyone didn’t know	Nixtieq li kulħadd ma kienx jaf
You know, like, work.	Taf, bħal, xogħol.
I had no idea how I would be	Ma kelli l-ebda idea kif inkun
If not.	Jekk le.
He will say his.	Huwa se jgħid tiegħu.
She didn't.	Hija ma.
He actually said that.	Huwa fil-fatt qal li.
We make some things a bit easier.	Aħna nagħmlu xi affarijiet daqsxejn aktar faċli.
I need to do something soon	Ikolli bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa dalwaqt
That’s just the truth.	Dik hija biss il-verità.
In fact, like a child.	Fil-fatt, bħal tifel.
He still does.	Għadu jagħmel.
You're in the back of this car now.	Int tkun fuq wara ta’ din il-karozza issa.
He didn’t even know what he was saying.	Lanqas biss kien jaf li kien qal.
I think it looks beautiful	Naħseb li tidher sabiħa
I was enjoying this too	Jien kont qed nieħu gost ukoll dan
He has the last.	Huwa għandu l-aħħar.
I was sure he knew	Kont ċert li kien jaf
Nor do we.	Lanqas għandna.
This is really both.	Dan huwa verament it-tnejn.
It's too bad.	Huwa ħażin wisq.
I don’t think this is a good morning	Ma naħsibx li din hija filgħodu tajba
It is.	Qed ikun.
It works the same as above.	Jaħdem l-istess bħal ta 'hawn fuq.
Maybe this will never happen	Forsi dan qatt mhu se jiġri
It must be another man.	Għandu jkun raġel ieħor.
We know fast enough.	Nafu malajr biżżejjed.
I don’t think he knew he was coming	Naħseb li ma kienx jaf li kien ġej
I had no idea she was back here	Ma kellix idea li kienet lura hawn
You know, she's doing it.	Taf, hi qed tagħmel.
It wasn’t that, no more.	Ma kinitx dik, mhux aktar.
I wasn't scared, nothing	Ma kontx nibża’, xejn
I’ve definitely never seen anything like it	Żgur qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din
He couldn't say why.	Ma setax jgħid għaliex.
She was visible.	Hija kienet tidher.
I am much better than that	Jiena ħafna aħjar minn hekk
And he's not here.	U hu mhux hawn.
Neither do I.	Lanqas jien.
I wasn’t ready to talk to him	Ma kontx lest li nitkellem miegħu
Easy.	Faċli.
Nor should you.	U lanqas għandek.
I just thought.	Ħsibt biss.
As much as you can, as much as you can.	Kemm tista’, kemm tista’.
There, this was better.	Hemmhekk, dan kien aħjar.
He has already said too much.	Huwa diġà qal wisq.
I hadn’t thought about it	Ma kontx ħsibt dwarha
But not quite.	Imma le pjuttost.
I think here’s a job	Naħseb li hawn xogħol
I never thought about it	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan
I couldn't even eat	Lanqas ma stajt niekol
Neither are you.	Lanqas int.
I need you all to think	Għandi bżonn li inti kollha biex taħseb
It happened year after year.	Ġara sena wara sena.
She was saying what she had to say.	Kienet tgħid dak li kellha xi tgħid.
I doubt anyone would be there	Niddubita li jkun hemm xi ħadd
I like things like that	Inħobb affarijiet bħal dawn
You know it looks great.	Taf li tidher tajjeb ħafna.
Soon, this becomes more.	Malajr, dan isir aktar.
We never had that.	Qatt ma kellna hekk.
You had a chance.	Kellek ċans.
It gets better every year.	Jiġi aħjar kull sena.
It’s just no more, not for me.	Huwa biss mhux hemm aktar, mhux għalija.
I can't see who is doing this	Ma nistax nara min qed jagħmel dan
I couldn’t do anything without help.	Jien ma stajt nagħmel xejn mingħajr għajnuna.
Or before it was.	Jew qabel kien.
It had to be.	Kellu jkun.
I can't talk anymore tonight	Ma nistax nitkellem aktar illejla
Along with all that.	Flimkien ma’ dak kollu.
I had to do something about it, and quickly	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa dwar dan, u malajr
I do this tonight.	Nagħmel dan illejla.
I can't believe it either	Lanqas nista' nemmen
I always do that too	Dejjem nagħmel hekk ukoll
If anyone knows.	Jekk xi ħadd jaf.
Ready.	Lest.
He was great.	Huwa kien kbir.
I know how they are	Naf kif dawn huma
I will never do that	Jien qatt ma se nagħmel hekk
I think a lot of people would	Naħseb li ħafna nies kieku
I didn’t know he was going to come back	Ma kontx naf li se jiġi lura
You can't do anything.	Ma tistax tagħmel xejn.
More than many.	Aktar minn ħafna.
I am the only one doing this	Jien waħdi li qed nagħmel dan
A year since it all started	Sena minn meta beda kollox
This was going to happen.	Dan kien se jiġri.
I wanted more than anything	Ridt aktar minn kull ħaġa
Apparently this was not the case.	Milli jidher dan ma kienx hekk.
We would.	Aħna kieku.
To talk about what he loved.	Biex jitkellem dwar dak li kien iħobb.
I want to be yours forever	Irrid inkun tiegħek għal dejjem
I had to sit down again	Kelli nerġa’ noqgħod bilqiegħda
I said he wasn’t a friend to me	Jien għedt li ma kienx ħabib għalija
I don’t think that would be a very good idea.	Ma naħsibx li tkun idea tajba ħafna.
He was ready to go.	Kien lest biex imur.
I wasn’t ready to believe it	Ma kontx lest nemmen
It was our only chance.	Kienet l-uniku ċans tagħna.
I know what you're thinking	Naf x'qed taħseb
I couldn't wait.	Ma stajtx nistenna.
I want you to be better than me	Irrid li tkun aħjar minni
I would like to talk to you	Nixtieq nitkellem miegħek
It was me.	Kien minni.
You are here.	Inti qiegħed hawn.
I want to hear more, more, more.	Irrid nisma aktar, aktar, aktar.
And they were home.	U kienu d-dar.
I know exactly what is going on.	Naf eżatt x'inhu jiġri.
Nothing could be easier.	Xejn ma jista 'jkun aktar faċli.
She looks surprised.	Tidher sorpriż.
As it was.	Hekk kif kienet.
I didn’t know anything about it	Jien ma kont naf xejn dwar dan
If you think so.	Jekk taħseb.
That’s really it.	Dak hu tassew.
I was no more.	Ma kontx aktar.
It won't take much of your time.	Mhux se jieħu ħafna ħin tiegħek.
Not one.	Lanqas wieħed.
I need a lot more.	Għandi bżonn ħafna aktar.
We're just sure you've never heard of it.	Aħna biss żgur li int qatt ma smajt.
I have to be what it is	Jien għandi nkun dak li hemm
This is just the same.	Dan huwa biss l-istess.
I have to think about it.	Għandi taħseb dwar dan.
Sorry, but so.	Jiddispjaċini, imma hekk.
I knew it would take more time	Kont naf li wieħed jieħu aktar ħin
Everyone was scared.	Kulħadd kien jibża.
I wasn’t alone said	Jien ma kontx waħdi qal
I don’t think it will.	Ma naħsibx li se tagħmel.
I thought you would be	Ħsibt li inti tkun
I know it was her.	Naf li kienet hi.
I knew nothing	Jien ma kont naf xejn
If anyone has an idea of ​​what is going on.	Jekk xi ħadd għandu idea dwar x'inhu jiġri.
I thought it had to be you	Ħsibt li kellha tkun int
I can't go back now	Ma nistax lura issa
I want to know what they are doing	Irrid inkun naf x'qed jagħmlu
I don’t know if it was or not.	Ma nafx jekk kienx jew le.
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.	Jien ser nerġa' lura kemm jista' jkun malajr.
I know what comes next	Naf x'għandu jiġi wara
But this is not enough.	Imma dan mhux biżżejjed.
One time.	Darba waħda.
I can't understand the problem.	Jien ma nistax nifhem il-problema.
We know it will never happen.	Aħna nafu li qatt mhu se jiġri.
You can't go wrong with this one.	Inti ma tistax tmur ħażin ma 'dan wieħed.
I would be glad for that.	Inkun ferħan għal dan.
I did nothing.	Jien ma għamilt xejn.
She needed no work	Ma kellha bżonn l-ebda xogħol
I believe it was	Nemmen li kien
I don't know what will happen to this house.	Ma nafx x’se jiġri minn din id-dar.
I was a little tired too	Jien kont xi ftit għajjien ukoll
But there it was.	Imma kien hemm.
I just want to be here with us	Nixtieq biss li jkun hawn magħna
I'm glad he didn't say anything.	Jien ferħan li ma jgħid xejn.
That should be fine.	Dan għandu jkun tajjeb.
I never knew.	Qatt ma kont naf.
That was really all it was about	Dan kien verament kollu li kien dwar
In fact, it doesn't have to be that difficult.	Fil-fatt, m'għandux ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
Why this is happening because normally.	Għaliex dan qed jiġri għaliex normalment.
I always say so, always.	Dejjem ngħid hekk, dejjem.
Today I have nothing else to say	Illum m'għandix xi ħaġa oħra xi ngħid
He was driving the car.	Huwa kien qed isuq il-karozza.
It would make my job easier, too.	Ikun jagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi aktar faċli, ukoll.
I don't know what he's trying to do.	Ma nafx x’qed jipprova jagħmel.
There was nothing more for me than that.	Ma kien hemm xejn aktar għalija minn hekk.
I just loved saying that	I biss iħobb dan qal
She wants to be out of this house.	Hija trid tkun barra minn din id-dar.
Hours, actually.	Sigħat, fil-fatt.
I hope everything goes well for you	Nispera li kollox sejjer tajjeb għalik
I want to know what we're going to do.	Irrid nifhem x’se nagħmlu.
I hope you can as well.	Nispera li inti tista 'kif hekk.
I need you back	Għandi bżonn li inti lura
I still am, of course.	Jien għadni, ovvjament.
I have no idea what’s wrong.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'inhu ħażin.
And maybe it isn’t.	U forsi ma jkunx.
I'm not happy with you	Jien mhux kuntent miegħek
I was so glad she had a friend	Kont tant ferħan li kellha ħabib
I had thought the same thing before.	Jien kont ħsibt l-istess qabel.
Look here, my friend.	Ħares hawn, ħabib tiegħi.
But now.	Imma issa.
I couldn't see anything	Ma stajt nara xejn
There was too much he didn’t know yet.	Kien hemm wisq li għadu ma kienx jaf.
I can't do it anymore	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar
And he knew something else.	U kien jaf xi ħaġa oħra.
I know you are a good person	Naf li inti persuna tajba
You are here for you.	Int hawn għalik.
I really am.	Jien tassew.
The first time this happened in a long time.	L-ewwel darba li dan ġara fi żmien twil.
No one ever knows.	Ħadd qatt ma jaf.
It would be better not to chance.	Ikun aħjar li ma ċans.
After that, do the following.	Wara dan, tagħmel dan li ġej.
I can’t believe he did that	Ma nistax nemmen li għamel hekk
And he says for sure.	U jgħid żgur.
He had done nothing.	Ma kien għamel xejn.
I can say that	Jien nista' ngħid daqshekk
For me you are.	Għalija int.
Nothing bad will happen if we do.	Xejn ħażin ma jiġri jekk nagħmlu.
I really, really.	Jien tassew, tassew.
She did with me.	Hija għamlet miegħi.
I had never looked so good	Qatt ma kont deher daqshekk tajjeb
If you can, it's good for you.	Jekk tista’, tajjeb għalik.
I’ve been here a lot.	Jien kont hawn ħafna.
I just want to be me.	Irrid inkun jien biss.
She is expecting a child.	Qed jistenna tifel.
Or it is enough.	Jew huwa biżżejjed.
There was no need for one.	Ma kienx hemm bżonn wieħed.
I understand him well	Nifhem tajjeb miegħu
Who knew.	Li kienet taf.
I knew what it looked like	Kont naf kif kien jidher
It couldn't be worse.	Ma jistax ikun aktar ħażin.
We were outside.	Konna barra.
I have been here for many years	Ilni ħafna snin ilni hawn
I'm so scared.	Jien tant jibża.
We have a big problem here.	Għandna problema kbira hawn.
But he was a happy man.	Imma kien raġel ferħan.
It seems good to me but apparently it is not.	Jidher tajjeb għalija imma milli jidher mhuwiex.
I’ve never been able to do anything good, ever	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel xejn tajjeb, qatt
But not anymore.	Imma mhux aktar.
I never knew what it was	Qatt ma kont naf x’kien
As soon as you are well.	Hekk kif tkun tajjeb.
Not too much of a chance.	Mhux wisq ċans ta’ dak li trid.
That's what he did.	Dak għamel dan.
There is something there.	Hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
I know he's right too	Naf li għandu raġun ukoll
I didn’t want to do anything, actually	Ma ridt nagħmel xejn, fil-fatt
We can do that.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
Just me, my idea.	Jien biss, idea tiegħi.
He will not speak tonight.	Illejla mhux se jitkellem.
Not too late.	Mhux tard wisq.
It will be much, much better.	Se jkun ħafna, ħafna aħjar.
Not much, but little.	Mhux ħafna, imma ftit.
I will speak.	Jien se nitkellem.
It was over there.	Kienet hemm fuq.
It couldn’t be the same.	Ma setax ikun l-istess.
And really, there is much more.	U tassew, hemm ħafna aktar.
Everything will be fine.	Kollox se jkun tajjeb.
You're right.	Raġun int.
I wanted to know everything	Ridt inkun naf kollox
He wasn’t entirely sure where he needed to go.	Ma kienx ċert għal kollox fejn kellu bżonn imur.
I have no idea how to do that	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif tagħmel dan
And that is what it is.	U dan huwa dak li hu.
I know it could happen	Naf li jista’ jiġri
The problem is that it is not enough.	Il-problema hi li mhux biżżejjed.
I won’t wait long now	Mhux se nistenna twil issa
I had no friends at all	Ma kelli l-ebda ħbieb xejn
I know what you are	Naf dak li int
He didn’t know who he was.	Ma kienx jaf min kien.
I know what's mine	Jien naf x'inhu tiegħi
I wanted to tell you about it	Ridt ngħidlek dwar dan
I didn’t want all that to happen	Ma ridtx li jiġri dak kollu
Work came first.	Ix-xogħol ġie l-ewwel.
I did some work last night	Ilbieraħ filgħaxija għamilt xi xogħol
He couldn't stay yet.	Ma setax jibqa’ għadu.
Or someone else.	Jew xi ħadd ieħor.
A long, long time ago.	Żmien twil, twil ilu.
I was still the same man	Jien kont għadni l-istess raġel
Another was loved.	Ieħor kien iħobb.
I was really scared.	Verament kont nibża’.
I know.	Naf.
I'm really good	Jien verament tajjeb
I was hoping to talk to you	Kont nittama li nitkellem miegħek
This is still wrong.	Dan għadu ħażin.
Which I don’t want.	Li ma rridx.
I saw and heard a lot	Rajt u smajt ħafna
I hope this never happens again	Jien nittama li dan qatt ma jerġa’ jiġri
I wish you would never come.	Nixtieq li int qatt ma tiġi.
I didn’t know if this was right or not	Ma kontx naf jekk dan kienx tajjeb jew le
I have time to try.	Għandi ħin biex nipprova.
We want to be better than that.	Irridu nkunu aħjar minn hekk.
And no fun.	U l-ebda gost.
I'm not doing it.	Jien mhux qed nagħmel.
I wonder what is going on	Nistaqsi x'inhu dak li qed jiġri
But not much better.	Imma mhux wisq aħjar.
I just know.	Naf biss.
For a while this was good.	Għal xi żmien dan kien tajjeb.
I know what happened and that’s what it is	Naf x'ġara u huwa dak li hu
I want to be with him	Irrid inkun miegħu
But someone did.	Imma xi ħadd għamel.
I was sure of one thing	Kont ċert minn ħaġa waħda
I know it has to be that way.	Naf li għandu jkun hekk.
There can never be another chance.	Issa qatt ma jista’ jkun hemm ċans ieħor.
I need to know better	Għandi nkun naf aħjar
I want to see something	Irrid nara xi ħaġa
That was a big deal for him	Din kienet ħaġa kbira għalih
Now, or never.	Issa, jew qatt.
I was just busy.	Għadek kemm kont okkupat.
This can be both good and bad.	Din tista’ tkun xi ħaġa tajba u ħażina.
I was a boy.	Kont tifel.
It seems to have happened here.	Jidher li hekk ġara hawn.
Definitely did.	Żgur li għamel.
Probably saw me.	Probabbilment ra lili.
More and more.	Aktar u aktar.
After that it was too late.	Wara li kien tard wisq.
Tired of being tired.	Għajjien li tkun għajjien.
You will never be finished with this.	Inti qatt ma tkun lest ma 'dan.
I can only tell you why all this is happening	Nista’ ngħidlek biss għaliex qed jiġri dan kollu
I tell you everything you want to know.	Jien ngħidlek kull ħaġa li trid tkun taf.
It's just really good.	Huwa biss verament tajjeb.
Nobody told me.	Ħadd ma qalli.
I know what you're saying.	Naf x’qed tgħid tassew.
No one wants to drive too fast.	Ħadd ma jrid isuq malajr wisq.
The car is too good.	Il-karozza hija tajba wisq.
And you are ready.	U inti lest.
I'm telling you the truth	Jien ngħidlek il-verità
I’m pretty sure it’s the first time this has happened today.	Jien pjuttost ċert li hija l-ewwel darba li ġara llum.
You.	Inti.
Not a big deal for me.	Mhux ħaġa kbira għalija.
And it does.	U jagħmel.
I needed to think, but there was no time	Kelli bżonn naħseb, imma ma kienx hemm ħin
It's who they are.	Huwa min huma.
I still had no idea who she was	Għadni ma kellix idea min kienet
But there was no one there.	Imma ma kien hemm ħadd hemmhekk.
I believe it should be the same for everyone.	Nemmen li għandu jkun l-istess għal kulħadd.
That went well.	Dan mar biżżejjed.
John thought so too.	John ħaseb hekk ukoll.
He was a good man.	Kien raġel tajjeb.
It has never been so.	Qatt ma kien hekk.
I know I didn’t want to do that	Naf li ma ridtx tagħmel dan
I thought you should know.	Ħsibt li għandek tkun taf.
You come early in the morning and go home in the evening.	Tiġi kmieni filgħodu u tmur id-dar filgħaxija.
Why doing what he does is not your problem.	Għaliex jagħmel dak li jagħmel mhix il-problema tiegħek.
It takes a while.	Huwa jieħu ftit.
You had no way of knowing.	Ma kellek l-ebda mod biex tkun taf.
I was making a lot of money.	Kont qed nagħmel ħafna flus.
Not your finished.	Mhux lest tiegħek.
I believe he is right	Nemmen li għandu raġun
He was helping someone	Kien jgħin lil xi ħadd
Last night was last night.	Ilbieraħ filgħaxija kien ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
I love it.	Inħobb.
She was a very good person.	Kienet persuna tajba ħafna.
I just saw this.	Jien biss rajt dan.
I'm really sorry about that	Jien tassew jiddispjaċini għal dan
See what happened.	Ra x’ġara.
Nobody told me about it	Ħadd ma qalli dwarha
On something.	Fuq xi ħaġa.
But not good enough.	Imma mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
I don’t want to know anymore.	Ma rridx inkun naf aktar.
I would go back there	Nixtieq immur lura hemm
It's a little long.	Huwa ftit twil.
I want to go home, he thought	Irrid immur id-dar, ħaseb
I want you to go back to your house	Irrid li tmur lura d-dar tiegħek
That should be enough for us.	Dan għandu jkun biżżejjed għalina.
By then it was too late.	Sa dak iż-żmien kien tard wisq.
I always have someone with me.	Jien dejjem għandi xi ħadd miegħi.
This now.	Dan issa.
Now look at where he is.	Issa ħares lejn fejn hu.
It's a great idea.	Hija idea kbira.
But we never did.	Imma qatt ma għamilna.
I was very happy	Kont kuntent ħafna
We are what we are.	Aħna dak li aħna.
Whatever it is, it's for us.	Hu x’inhu, huwa għalina.
But that’s not what we did.	Imma dan mhux dak li għamilna.
Maybe that's enough.	Forsi dan huwa biżżejjed.
Now it should appear.	Issa għandu jidher.
Maybe they were the same.	Forsi kienu l-istess.
I came from there	Ġejt minn hemm
I could never understand this.	Qatt ma stajt nifhem dan.
I never know what you're thinking	Qatt ma naf x’qed taħseb
I need to talk to you about it	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek dwarha
That was to be the last thing he saw.	Dik kellha tkun l-aħħar ħaġa li ra.
I don’t even know how long I was.	Lanqas naf kemm kont twil.
It won’t go where you want it.	Mhux se tmur fejn trid.
I saw it happen.	Rajt jiġri.
I could see he was worried	Stajt nara li kien inkwetat
That’s the only one coming to me right now.	Dik hija l-unika waħda li qed tiġi għandi bħalissa.
You have no idea how much money you can make.	M'għandekx idea kemm tista' tagħmel flus.
I love my job, actually	Jien inħobb ix-xogħol tiegħi, fil-fatt
Not sure if that’s a lot or a little.	Mhux ċert jekk dak hux ħafna jew ftit.
Now we are.	Issa aħna.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.	Ħażin, ħażin, ħażin.
Or from someone who is for me.	Jew minn xi ħadd li qiegħed għalija.
Now it can do the same for you !.	Issa jista' jagħmel l-istess għalik!.
I can't wait any longer	Ma nistax nistenna aktar
I had to think of that.	I kellha ħsibt ta 'dak.
I know there is more to it than that	Naf li hemm aktar minn hekk
He didn’t know me.	Ma kienx jaf lili.
It really happens.	Huwa verament jiġri.
I want to think about it	Irrid naħseb dwarha
I would say he didn’t have time	Jien ngħid li ma kellux ħin
But, you never know.	Imma, qatt ma tkun taf.
I had so I had with him	Kelli hekk kelli miegħu
I have no money.	M'għandix flus.
Something was wrong about that.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina dwar dan.
I need to be out here.	Għandi bżonn inkun hawn barra.
I wanted something out.	Ridt xi ħaġa barra.
I need to see everything, to know exactly what happened	Għandi bżonn nara kollox, biex inkun naf eżatt x’ġara
These are the things that are just.	Dawn huma l-affarijiet li huma biss.
I see that, come here.	Nara li, ġej hawn.
I wasn’t really thinking	Jien ma kontx verament naħseb
And every morning.	U kull filgħodu.
Obviously I knew before you	Ovvjament kont naf qabel int
It wasn’t a big problem.	Ma kinitx problema kbira.
I love being with you	Inħobb inkun miegħek
There is nothing.	M'hemm xejn.
I have to do better	Ikolli nagħmel aħjar
But so it was.	Imma hekk kien.
She had no time to think.	Ma kellha l-ebda ħin biex taħseb.
But he had friends.	Imma kellu ħbieb.
We need time.	Għandna bżonn iż-żmien.
Lots of things.	Ħafna affarijiet.
I just want to be where I am	Irrid inkun biss fejn ikun
It was not there yet.	Għadu ma kienx hemm.
I haven't been with you in a long time	Ilni ma kontx miegħek
I wasn’t anyone.	Jien ma kontx ħadd.
I didn’t like talking	Ma kontx inħobb nitkellem
Never more than that.	Qatt aktar minn hekk.
He went alone into the outer room.	Huwa mar waħdu fil-kamra ta 'barra.
Maybe do more.	Forsi jagħmlu aktar.
He can talk if he wants to.	Jista’ jitkellem jekk irid.
I want to do everything	Irrid nagħmel kollox
That's just it.	Hekk hu biss.
I was doing this.	Kont qed nagħmel dan.
I don't need that.	M'għandix bżonn dan.
She can stand alone.	Hija tista 'toqgħod waħedha.
It's just the same.	Hija biss l-istess.
I had nothing for it	Ma kelli xejn għalih
Today she was talking a lot.	Illum kienet titkellem ħafna.
I didn’t need to do anything, you did it all	Ma kelli bżonn nagħmel xejn, int għamilt dan kollu
I’m not saying anything more	Jien ma ngħid xejn aktar
It's really good.	Huwa tassew tajjeb.
I never saw it, I never heard it.	Qatt ma rajt, qatt ma smajt.
He was right behind me.	Huwa kien eżatt wara lili.
And here we were.	U hawn konna.
I couldn’t wait until morning.	Ma stajtx nistenna sa filgħodu.
You were right about everything.	Kellek raġun dwar kollox.
I have to do the same	Ikolli nagħmel l-istess
It is currently too early for this.	Bħalissa għadu kmieni wisq għal dan.
It really was so good.	Tassew kienet daqshekk tajba.
It can be really good.	Jista 'jkun verament tajjeb.
I can’t believe he’s doing this to me	Ma nistax nemmen li qed jagħmel dan miegħi
Both were many.	It-tnejn kienu ħafna.
We were the first.	Konna l-ewwel.
I had to have some fun	Kelli nieħu xi gost
I’ve done this before	Jien għamilt dan qabel
He can do it.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel dan.
He is happy and content.	Huwa kuntent u kuntent.
But it has happened.	Imma ġie jiġri.
I will always believe this	Jien dejjem se nemmen dan
There's that.	Hemm dak.
You need money.	Għandek bżonn flus.
I have a car outside.	Għandi karozza barra.
Anything can happen, boy.	Jista' jiġri kollox, tifel.
I just wanted to think about it	Ridt biss noqgħod naħseb
I think so	Naħseb li hekk hi
One problem may be timing.	Problema waħda tista’ tkun iż-żmien.
I think it happened here	Naħseb li ġara hawn
Me, not so good.	Jien, mhux daqshekk tajjeb.
I do my job.	Nagħmel xogħol tiegħi.
I was just thinking about it	Kont biss naħseb dwarha
And we knew it was wrong.	U konna nafu li kien ħażin.
More than before.	Aktar minn qabel.
Too early.	Wisq kmieni wisq.
It takes some work to do that.	Jeħtieġ xi xogħol biex tagħmel dan.
For one thing, she had no money.	Minn ħaġa waħda, hija ma kellha l-ebda flus.
She didn’t have to do that.	Hija ma kellha tagħmel dan.
I will say no more	Mhux se ngħid aktar
I wish there was another way, but there wasn’t	Nixtieq li kien hemm mod ieħor, imma ma kienx hemm
No one had ever done so before.	Ħadd qatt ma kien għamel hekk qabel.
He said it looks better.	Qal li tidher aħjar.
I needed time to think	Kelli bżonn iż-żmien biex naħseb
I hope you can as well	Nispera li inti tista 'kif hekk
No one is better than this.	Ħadd mhu aħjar minn dan.
So much had gone back.	Tant kien mar lura.
It's not.	Huwa le.
This has happened more than once.	Dan ġara aktar minn darba.
I don’t know how this comes about.	Ma nafx kif ġej dan.
I can see how this can be done	Nista 'nara kif dan jista' jagħmel dan
I did it three years on my own after this time	Għamilt tliet snin waħdi wara dan iż-żmien
I can’t think of everyone	Ma nistax naħseb għal kulħadd
You will be fine.	Int se tkun tajjeb.
I didn't have to worry anymore.	Ma kellix għalfejn nibża’ aktar.
Someone does it.	Xi ħadd jagħmel dan.
Many, in fact	Ħafna, fil-fatt
I'm here.	Jien hawn fuq.
I know where I was	Naf fejn kont
This is because there is nothing.	Dan għaliex m'hemm xejn.
And, we did.	U, għamilna.
I will not do that.	Jien mhux se nagħmel dan.
It did not appear.	Ma deherx.
This is wrong.	Dan huwa ħażin.
I hope this is good with you	Nispera li dan huwa tajjeb miegħek
He knew it was the last.	Kien jaf li kien l-aħħar.
But that too was wrong.	Imma dan ukoll kien ħażin.
I couldn’t believe it.	Ma stajtx nemmen li.
You can’t talk about it.	Ma tistax titkellem dwar dan.
I will do no more	Mhux se nagħmel aktar
I now probably need to do that.	I issa probabbilment jeħtieġ li nagħmel hekk.
But this is my job.	Imma dan huwa xogħol tiegħi.
But it wasn’t enough, it would never be enough for him.	Imma ma kienx biżżejjed, qatt ma kien ikun biżżejjed għalih.
Not so fast.	Mhux daqshekk malajr.
It can't be done.	Ma jistax isir.
It doesn’t have to be there maybe.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun hemm forsi.
No one asked for money.	Ħadd ma talab flus.
A long time ago	Żmien twil ilu
Hopefully it will never happen again.	Wieħed jittama li qatt ma jerġa’ jkun.
I’ve never been so happy, either.	Jien qatt ma kont daqshekk kuntent, lanqas.
He's gone now.	Huwa mar issa.
I couldn't understand	Ma stajtx nifhem
Much has to be done.	Ħafna għandu jagħmel.
You are not saying that everyone does this.	Mhux qed tgħid li kulħadd jagħmel dan.
I'm sure this will work	Jiena ċert li dan se jaħdem
Maybe he was right.	Forsi kellu raġun.
I just want to sit down and do it	Irrid biss noqgħod bilqiegħda u nagħmel
Well, she did.	Ukoll, hija għamlet.
Maybe he didn’t even try to happen.	Forsi lanqas biss ipprova jiġri.
I have another idea.	Għandi idea oħra.
I never thought it was	Qatt ma ħsibt li kien
Everything looked good.	Kollox deher tajjeb.
This is all mine.	Dan huwa kollox tiegħi.
We want more.	Irridu aktar.
It seemed like I never told anyone.	Deher li qatt ma għidt lil ħadd.
I want to be more than your friend	Irrid inkun aktar minn ħabib tiegħek
Look like that.	Ħares hekk.
You want to know that.	Trid tkun taf dak.
No one knows anyone.	Ħadd ma jaf lil ħadd.
A little tired for sure	Xi ftit għajjien żgur
I wanted to know why he was waiting outside my school.	Ridt inkun naf għaliex kien jistenna barra l-iskola tiegħi.
I’m doing a lot more than that now.	Qed nagħmel ħafna aktar minn dan issa.
That’s what you’re supposed to do.	Dak hu li suppost tagħmel.
I had to do something fast	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa malajr
I'm late, very late	Jien tard, tard ħafna
I'm an outsider	Jien persuna barra
Is you good or bad account or both.	Huwa int kont tajjeb jew ħażin jew it-tnejn.
I just know this is what you do	Naf biss li dan huwa dak li tagħmel
This is never certain.	Dan qatt mhu ċert.
It doesn’t have to be now.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun issa.
Not that one.	Mhux dik waħda.
That was probably a good thing.	Li probabbilment kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
It started well.	Huwa beda tajjeb.
It's actually a lot easier than you think.	Huwa fil-fatt ħafna aktar faċli milli taħseb.
We were much better.	Konna ħafna aħjar.
I haven’t been home yet either	Għadni ma kontx id-dar lanqas
I have the house.	Jien għandi d-dar.
I'm talking to you.	Qed nitkellem miegħek.
Just know.	Xi ftit taf.
I want you to think about it	Irrid li taħseb dwarha
You can't do better.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel aħjar.
I think they should.	Naħseb li għandhom.
I definitely don’t want to be like that.	Żgur li ma rridx inkun hekk.
I know someone is coming for him	Naf li xi ħadd ġej għalih
I had to do better	I kellha tagħmel aħjar
he asked.	staqsa.
please don't.	jekk jogħġbok ma.
There are things we can only do.	Hemm affarijiet li nistgħu nagħmlu biss.
I can’t believe this happened.	Ma nistax nemmen li ġara dan.
I said maybe it wouldn’t be a bad idea.	Għidt li forsi ma tkunx idea ħażina.
This may come later.	Dan jista 'jiġi aktar tard.
I wish it wasn’t so beautiful	Nixtieq li ma kinitx daqshekk sabiħa
Too much work to get something going.	Wisq xogħol biex xi ħaġa tmur.
Small and tired.	Żgħir u għajjien.
When, of course, it was not so.	Meta, ovvjament, ma kienx hekk.
I’ve seen him be here for a while.	Stajt nara li nkunu hawn għal xi żmien.
I knew something was wrong	Kont naf li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina
If you can think you can, you will.	Jekk inti tista 'taħseb li tista', inti se.
Like, really, really great.	Bħal, tassew, tassew kbir.
I was sure she was.	Kont ċert li kienet.
I'm pretty tired.	Jien pjuttost għajjien.
I may know what it is	I jista 'jkun naf dak li hu
I'm not sure why.	M'inix ċert għaliex huwa hekk.
It was very good and very small.	Kien tajjeb ħafna u żgħir ħafna.
It wasn’t easy, either.	Ma kienx faċli, lanqas.
It was really easy actually	Kien verament faċli fil-fatt
Now is the time to do it.	Issa jkun iż-żmien li tagħmel dan.
I will say more about this later	I se ngħid aktar dwar dan aktar tard
I need to know these things	Ikolli nkun naf dawn l-affarijiet
There was something said.	Kien hemm xi qal.
I want more than that, much more than that	Irrid aktar minn hekk, ħafna aktar minn hekk
I know he knows.	Naf li jaf.
Nor is it likely.	Lanqas huwa probabbli.
He needs to do this job.	Jeħtieġ li jagħmel dan ix-xogħol.
I was thinking the same thing about you	Kont qed naħseb l-istess ħaġa dwar tiegħek
Well, she did.	Ukoll, hija għamlet.
No one had done anything wrong.	Ħadd ma kien għamel xejn ħażin.
But you won't.	Imma int mhux se.
I had little problem	Ma tantx kelli problema
He said we did.	Huwa qal li għamilna.
It wasn’t my time to go.	Ma kienx il-ħin tiegħi li mmur.
I needed to be with him	Kelli bżonn inkun miegħu
It was more that it was still time	Kien aktar li kien għadu wasal iż-żmien
For this week only.	Għal din il-ġimgħa biss.
I said that was what happened after he went back	Għidt li kien dak li ġara wara li mar lura
I'll have to think about it and come back to me.	Ikolli naħseb dwar dan u nerġa’ nerġa’ għandi.
I still can't do that	Għadni ma nistax nagħmel dan
That’s what’s good for everyone.	Huwa dak li hu tajjeb għal kulħadd.
I wanted to do as he asked	Ridt nagħmel kif talab hu
I want to ask.	Irrid nistaqsi.
We have the same man.	Għandna l-istess raġel.
I just need to do more.	Għandi bżonn biss biex nagħmel aktar.
I was listening to something	Kont nisma’ xi ħaġa
This could not be happening.	Dan ma setax ikun qed jiġri.
That was what we did.	Kien dak li għamilna.
I have to believe that.	Irrid nemmen li.
When it’s good it’s good.	Meta jkun tajjeb huwa tajjeb.
This cannot be.	Dan ma jistax ikun.
But that was out.	Imma dak kien barra.
I couldn’t take everything	Ma stajtx nieħu kollox
I just sit and listen	Jien biss noqgħod u nisma’
This seems likely.	Dan jidher probabbli.
He would do this first thing in the morning.	Kien jagħmel dan l-ewwel ħaġa filgħodu.
You didn’t go along with that.	Inti ma kontx tmur flimkien ma 'dak.
I can’t believe what you just said	Ma nistax nemmen dak li għadek kif għidt
No one knows where he lives.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn jgħix.
Obviously it had to be there.	Ovvjament kellha tkun hemm.
I have never done this before	Qatt ma għamilt hekk qabel
There wasn’t much time.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna ħin.
It was a little better last night.	Kien ftit aħjar ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
It can’t be as bad as everything.	Ma jistax ikun ħażin daqs dak kollu.
Or we are.	Jew aħna.
Definitely helps.	Żgur li jgħin.
And maybe he’s right.	U forsi għandu raġun.
I thought a lot for you too.	Ħsibt ħafna għalik ukoll.
I just thought.	Ħsibt biss.
Also, it seems to be going well.	Barra minn hekk, jidher li sejjer tajjeb.
It’s time to go.	Wasal iż-żmien li mmorru.
I said it was good	Għidt li kien tajjeb
I have never seen better.	Qatt ma rajt aħjar.
I was sure he didn’t want me	Kont ċert li ma ridtx lili
But he is right.	Imma għandu raġun.
It was he who was speaking.	Kien hu li kien qed jitkellem.
I'm too tired.	Jien għajjien wisq.
I wasn't ready to be here again any time soon	Ma kontx lest li nerġa’ nkun hawn hekk malajr
I need some time to think about everything	Għandi bżonn ftit ħin biex naħseb dwar kollox
I just didn’t want anyone to know.	Jien biss ma ridt li ħadd ikun jaf.
It’s pretty easy, too.	Huwa pjuttost faċli, ukoll.
We know better than that.	Nafu aħjar minn hekk.
I know you don’t want to.	Naf li ma tridx.
I really think it does	Verament naħseb li jagħmel
I suspect he needs a lot of money	Nissuspetta li għandu bżonn kbir ta’ flus
I don't have the time.	M'għandix il-ħin.
In fact she was right.	Fil-fatt kellha raġun.
Well, probably not.	Ukoll, probabbilment le.
Interested ?.	Interessat?.
It’s actually about what we’re doing now.	Huwa fil-fatt dwar dak li qed nagħmlu issa.
I just didn’t want to go there with him	Jien biss ma ridtx immur hemm miegħu
I was a little surprised	Kont xi ftit sorpriż
I should have known something was wrong	I kellha naf li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina
I know a man who knows a man	Naf raġel li jaf raġel
It's a great thing.	Hija ħaġa kbira.
Don’t do it now.	Ma tagħmilx hekk issa.
Not the first time, sure.	Mhux l-ewwel darba, żgur.
He is right that.	Huwa għandu raġun li.
I will never go there again	Qatt mhu se nerġa’ mmur hemm
Not too late.	Mhux tard wisq.
I want to do something about it.	Irrid nagħmel xi ħaġa dwar dan.
Maybe it was too early.	Forsi kien kmieni wisq.
He knew it would be her.	Kien jaf li kieku kien hi.
Much more.	Ħafna aktar.
I didn’t believe this	Ma kontx nemmen dan
I wasn’t even eating	Jien lanqas biss kont niekol
I doubt he is.	Niddubita li hu.
The same one.	L-istess waħda.
Something has to be done.	Irid isir xi ħaġa.
What is it ?.	X'inhu?.
It was once.	Kienet darba.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
I will not try this week	Mhux se nipprova din il-ġimgħa
In a little.	Fi ftit.
I don't have to.	M'għandix.
That he will never leave.	Li qatt mhu se jitlaq.
Come on, here.	Ejja, hawn.
She had only one.	Kellha waħda biss.
More can happen.	Jista' jiġri aktar.
Now there is something else.	Issa hemm ħaġa oħra.
I want to see if this will work	Irrid nara jekk dan hux se jaħdem
I’ve never been able to do that, all that	Jien qatt ma stajt nagħmel dan, dak kollu
It was.	Kienet.
She knows you're out now.	Hija taf li int hawn barra issa.
I had no idea he was coming.	Ma kellix idea li kien ġej.
We can both go.	It-tnejn nistgħu mmorru.
This is too much.	Dan huwa wisq.
I didn’t know what to expect	Ma kontx naf x'se nistenna
I just heard it last night	Għadni kemm smajt ilbieraħ filgħaxija
I just saw what he did to me	Jien biss rajt dak li għamel miegħi
He often did.	Ħafna drabi kien jagħmel.
Or someone else.	Jew xi ħadd ieħor.
He looked a little better.	Huwa ħares ftit aħjar.
I really want to be friends	Verament nixtieq inkun ħbieb
Now he has an idea.	Issa għandu idea.
You have what you need.	Għandek dak li għandek bżonn.
And so mine.	U hekk tiegħi.
I thought it was great	Ħsibt li kien tajjeb ħafna
It was great.	Kien kbir.
Never do that.	Qatt ma tagħmel dan.
So it seemed.	Hekk deher.
I've been there more for him	Stajt kont hemm aktar għalih
This looks like this.	Dan jidher kif ġej.
There is nothing better than that.	M'hemm xejn aħjar minn hekk.
I know, of course, what happened	Naf, ovvjament, x’ġara
The first time it happened was with you.	L-ewwel darba li ġara kien miegħek.
I've done something	Stajt għamilt xi ħaġa
only a small child.	tifel żgħir biss.
I have to be ready to go.	Għandi nkun lest biex immur.
Anything else could happen.	Kollox ieħor jista 'jiġri.
I wasn't happy	Jien ma kontx kuntent
I think you say something	Naħseb li tgħid xi ħaġa
I'm ready now	Jien lest issa
She did this to me, too, the first year.	Hija għamlet dan lili, ukoll, l-ewwel sena.
I didn't know what happened, or when	Ma kontx naf x’ġara, jew lanqas meta
I’m a teacher, by all means.	Jien għalliem, minn kollox.
I just want to know what it looks like	Irrid biss inkun naf kif jidher
I will always be there.	Inkun dejjem hemm.
Nothing seemed right to us.	Xejn ma deher tajjeb għalina.
I had an idea.	Kelli idea.
Come home, boy.	Ejja d-dar, tifel.
I want to know what they are doing	Irrid inkun naf x'qed jagħmlu
It's not you.	Mhuwiex int.
I’m talking about everything.	Qed nitkellem fuq kollox.
But he couldn't say for sure.	Imma ma setax jgħid ċert.
What's up, now? 	X'hemm, issa?
.	.
It will probably help.	Probabbilment se jgħin.
We'll do one at a time.	Aħna ser nagħmlu waħda kull darba.
That wasn't hard now, was it? 	Dan ma kienx diffiċli issa, hux?
Is everyone interested ?.	Kulħadd huwa interessat?.
It can never be.	Qatt ma jista’ jkun.
He has a lot of problems.	Għandu ħafna problemi.
There was no one here.	Ma kien hemm ħadd hawn.
This was one for him.	Din kienet waħda għalih.
I thought about it a little more	Ħsibt fi ftit aktar
I should have known what was going on	Kelli nkun naf x’qed jiġri
Now, we will.	Issa, aħna se.
As soon as we can.	Hekk kif nistgħu.
As well as it should be.	Kif ukoll għandu jkun.
I thought it looked too small, but I didn't say anything	Ħsibt li deher żgħir wisq, imma ma għedt xejn
I did we did.	Għamilt għamilna.
None of this.	Xejn minn dan.
You've done better !.	Inti stajt għamilt aħjar!.
I wanted to do that	Jien ridt nagħmel dan
I was there I still wasn't there	Jien kont hemm għadni ma hemm
I should know how it happened	Għandi naf kif ġara
I didn't think so	Ma kontx ħsibt hekk
I did enough.	Għamilt biżżejjed.
You really look good there boy.	Int verament tidher tajba hemm tifel.
He wants to get home now.	Ikun irid jasal id-dar issa.
I have no idea how many there are now	M'għandi l-ebda idea kemm hemm issa
I can't go back now	Ma stajtx lura issa
I hope all is well with him	Nispera li kollox huwa tajjeb miegħu
Do nothing.	Ma tagħmel xejn.
It actually turned out pretty well.	Fil-fatt ħareġ pjuttost tajjeb.
Nothing more will happen tonight.	Mhu se jiġri xejn aktar illejla.
I knew that now.	Jien kont naf li issa.
This one does.	Dan wieħed jagħmel.
She will go, but he will not stay.	Hi se tmur, imma hu mhux se jibqa’.
What he was trying to do.	X'kien qed jipprova.
This is what we need.	Dan huwa dak li għandna bżonn.
I know it would be good for me	Naf li tkun tajjeb għalija
I knew it was him, it had to be	Kont naf li kien hu, kellu jkun
He knows what it's like to be you and me.	Jaf x’inhi li nkunu int u jien.
I want it to be something more than that	Irrid li tkun xi ħaġa aktar minn hekk
He wasn't here either.	Ma kienx hawn lanqas.
She just wants to be with me.	Hija trid biss tkun miegħi.
Not there now.	Mhix hemm issa.
It could have been, but it really wasn't.	Seta’ kien, imma tassew ma kienx.
And it started.	U beda.
I had to do this job	Kelli nagħmel dan ix-xogħol
That was pretty much it.	Dak kien pjuttost.
This is not how it works.	Dan mhux kif jaħdem.
I’m going to do this whether you like it or not.	Jien ser nagħmel dan kemm jekk tixtieq jew le.
I wonder how long that was	Nistaqsi kemm kien ilu dak
He will never do anything wrong.	Qatt mhu se tagħmel xi ħażin.
I never made it home	Qatt ma għamilt id-dar
He keeps trying to leave.	Jibqa' jipprova jitlaq.
I never wanted anyone else.	Qatt ma ridt lil xi ħadd aktar.
But not everyone was happy.	Imma mhux kulħadd kien kuntent.
I love doing things for you	Inħobb nagħmel affarijiet għalik
I can never go back	Qatt ma nista’ nerġa’ noqgħod lura
He did not know what to do.	Ma kienx jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
I believe that is what happened	Nemmen li hekk ġara
And it’s not looking good.	U mhux qed jidher tajjeb.
I've heard enough.	Smajt biżżejjed.
Not what it was.	Mhux dak li kien.
But it was good enough.	Imma kien tajjeb biżżejjed.
I know you know.	Naf li taf.
Do you think that.	Taħseb li dak.
This would not be so easy.	Dan ma jkunx daqshekk faċli.
Nothing happened, everything was fine.	Ma ġara xejn, kollox kien tajjeb.
I'd better go home	Aħjar mmur id-dar
I hope not the same	Nittama li mhux l-istess
No one wanted to do that.	Ħadd ma ried jagħmel dan.
I’ve been here before.	Jien kont hawn qabel.
This is not supposed to happen, but it is.	Dan mhux suppost jiġri, imma hekk hu.
Sometimes it is too late.	Xi drabi jkun tard wisq.
I have to do this.	Ikolli nagħmel dan.
How much more was it.	Kemm aktar kien.
I will do my best to be with you	Jien se nagħmel minn kollox biex inkun miegħek
But it wasn’t fast enough.	Imma ma kienx malajr biżżejjed.
I can’t believe what just happened	Ma nistax nemmen dak li ġara biss
I hadn’t thought about it that way before	Ma kontx ħsibt dwarha hekk qabel
Please, for me.	Jekk jogħġbok, għalija.
No, really, it happens often.	Le, tassew, jiġri spiss.
I know a few people who do that	Naf ftit nies li jagħmlu dan
I can't wait to think.	Ma nistax noqgħod naħseb.
As well.	Kif ukoll.
I thought he was too happy.	Ħsibt li kien kuntent wisq.
I should have known he knew everything about it	I kellha tkun naf li kien jaf kollox dwar dan
It's so small.	Huwa daqshekk żgħir.
I never thought you would be telling me this	Qatt ma ħsibt li se tkun qed tgħidli dan
All of them, just people.	Kollha kemm huma, nies biss.
He needed my help.	Huwa kellu bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħi.
I want you to know everything he says	Irrid li tkun taf dak kollu li jgħid
No one wants to talk to me.	Ħadd ma jrid jitkellem miegħi.
I just worried it's all over	I biss inkwetat huwa kollox
And easy enough.	U faċli biżżejjed.
Can anyone please help.	Jista' xi ħadd jekk jogħġbok jgħin.
I believe it will go fast	Nemmen li se tmur malajr
And for.	U għal.
Not really there.	Mhux verament hemm.
I’m glad he still lives	Jien ferħan li għadu jgħix
I should know more.	Għandi nkun naf aktar.
Come and go.	Jiġi u jmur.
I always have been and always will be	Dejjem kont u dejjem se nkun
I'm glad you're ready.	Jien kuntent li lest.
I am very sorry for many things	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal ħafna affarijiet
He knew what he was doing.	Kien jaf x’kien għamel dan.
He never wanted to.	Hu qatt ma ried.
I didn’t have to tell anyone	Jien ma kelli ngħid lil ħadd
I'm so lonely and so scared.	Jien tant waħdi u tant nibża’.
I can’t just do these things.	Ma nistax nagħmel dawn l-affarijiet biss.
Not ready.	Mhux lest.
But that can wait, that waits.	Imma dak jista 'jistenna, li jistenna.
Say what you think.	Għid dak li taħseb.
He said he did not know how he got there.	Qal li ma kienx jaf kif wasal hemm.
But she is not like us.	Imma hi mhix kif aħna.
I enjoy being with you	Jien nieħu gost inkun miegħek
I will listen.	Jien se nisma.
Prove that it is not.	Ipprova li mhuwiex.
That was three years ago.	Dan kien tliet snin ilu.
She had never made me one.	Hija qatt ma kienet għamlet lili waħda.
I would say they do.	Jien ngħid li jagħmlu.
Until the end.	Sa l-aħħar.
I never did that.	Jien qatt ma għamilt dan.
Anyone can do it now.	Kulħadd jista 'jagħmel dan issa.
I didn't want to be here anymore	Ma ridtx inkun hawn aktar
It seems that.	Jidher li.
It has been so since he was a child.	Kien hekk sa minn meta kien tifel.
I was too tired to ask about it.	Kont għajjien wisq biex nistaqsi dwar dan.
It seems great to me.	Jidher kbir għalija.
Yours alone.	Tiegħek waħdek.
She just does it.	Hija biss tagħmel dan.
I know mine is.	Naf tiegħi huwa.
I doubt he ever had one	Niddubita li qatt kellu wieħed
It may be later.	Jista 'jkun aktar tard.
This was never done.	Dan qatt ma sar.
And not just here.	U mhux hawn biss.
I didn’t want that like no	Ma ridtx li bħal le
It all happened very quickly.	Kollox ġara malajr ħafna.
I have always been happy with you	Dejjem kont kuntent miegħek
I wasn’t on that	Jien ma kontx kontx fuq dan
But you had to.	Imma kellek.
I don't want to know anymore	Ma rridx inkun naf aktar
Everyone is friendly with us.	Kulħadd huwa faċli magħna.
Surely there must be more than that.	Żgur li jrid ikun hemm aktar minn hekk.
That should be enough for him.	Dan għandu jkun biżżejjed għalih.
I didn't need anything else	Ma kelli bżonn xejn aktar
I had thought about this before	I kellha ħsibt dwar dan qabel
I will definitely go back	Żgur li mmur lura
A man went back to my house.	Raġel mar lura d-dar tiegħi.
There was no one else around.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor madwar.
But for me it’s more than that.	Imma għalija huwa aktar minn hekk.
If there was later.	Jekk kien hemm aktar tard.
I thought I already did	Ħsibt li diġà għamilt
More on that a little later.	Aktar dwar dan ftit aktar tard.
Nor did he do so.	Lanqas ma għamel hekk.
No, in fact, you don't.	Le, fil-fatt, inti ma.
I never said.	Qatt ma għedt.
I don’t have a lot of people to talk to.	M'għandix ħafna nies biex nitkellem.
That must be it.	Dak irid ikun.
I was already so in love with him	Diġà kont tant inħobb miegħu
It happened so fast.	Ġara daqshekk malajr.
I’ve always tried to understand this	Jien kont dejjem nipprova nifhem dan
I don’t even want to think about it.	Lanqas irrid naħseb dwarha.
And it can.	U jista.
I can say these things	Jien nista' ngħid dawn l-affarijiet
I don’t need his help.	M'għandix bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħu.
I wanted to be him.	Jien ridt inkun hu.
You are very good.	Int tajjeb ħafna.
It seems like I can't do that	Jidher li ma nistax nagħmel hekk
Looks like you came back here again	Jidher li ġejt lura hawn mill-ġdid
Nothing bad will happen.	Mhu se jiġri xejn ħażin.
Never ever do that.	Qatt qatt ma jagħmel hekk.
I just want you to know	Irrid biss li tkun taf
You do nothing.	Inti ma tagħmel xejn.
I never was.	Qatt ma kont.
I hope someone here can help.	Nispera li xi ħadd hawn jista 'jgħin.
I want you to know what happened, how it happened	Irrid li tkun taf x'ġara, kif ġara
I didn’t know he was your friend	Ma kontx naf li kien ħabib tiegħek
It could happen to you.	Jista 'jiġri għalik.
Look at what you eat.	Ħares lejn dak li tiekol.
I have no idea where he lives.	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn jgħix.
Not very much just a little.	Mhux ħafna biss ftit.
This is a great one for me.	Din hija waħda kbira għalija.
Maybe he had more money than anyone knew.	Forsi kellu aktar flus milli kien jaf xi ħadd.
They were doing it.	Huma kienu jagħmlu dan.
I have no idea	M'għandi l-ebda idea
He saw it all.	Huwa ra dan kollu.
Much like a car.	Ħafna bħal karozza.
I try something once.	Nipprova xi ħaġa darba.
It was not easy.	Ma kienx faċli.
This did not seem likely.	Dan ma deherx probabbli.
But nothing like this happened.	Imma ma ġara xejn bħal dan.
I had nothing to say	Ma kellix xi ngħid
I don’t know where I’m doing wrong.	Ma nafx fejn qed nagħmel ħażin.
He knew it would come.	Kien jaf li se jiġi.
I don’t know how he got there.	Ma nafx kif wasal hemm.
I can never do good.	Jien qatt ma nista’ nagħmel tajjeb.
And it was his last.	U kien l-aħħar tiegħu.
I'm just too tired	Jien biss għajjien wisq
He was a really good friend.	Kien tassew ħabib tajjeb.
He didn’t want to do that.	Ma riedx jagħmel dan.
They were for me.	Kienu għalija.
I can be me.	Jien nista’ nkun jien.
It wasn’t bad for him.	Ma kienx ħażin għalih.
I will never be good again.	Qatt ma nkun tajjeb mill-ġdid.
I think everyone knows this by now	Naħseb li kulħadd jaf dan sa issa
Not much to say about this.	Mhux wisq xi ngħid dwar dan.
But so is he.	Imma hekk hu.
You want it.	Trid trid.
I couldn't really tell what was going on	Ma stajtx verament ngħid x’kien qed jiġri
That's not the case.	Dak mhux hekk.
That usually works.	Li normalment jaħdem.
If you’re right, he couldn’t have done otherwise.	Jekk għandek raġun, ma setax jagħmel mod ieħor.
We did well.	Għamilna tajjeb.
The time.	Il-ħin.
I didn’t want to talk about it anymore	Ma ridtx nitkellem aktar dwarha
She is always beautiful.	Hija dejjem sabiħa.
I did it once	Għamilt darba
This can be anything you want.	Dan jista 'jkun dak kollu li trid.
It would be better that way.	Ikun aħjar hekk.
I really do, you know	Jien tassew, taf
I would be a little bit of everything	Inkun xi ftit minn kollox
He didn’t say so.	Ma kienx jgħid hekk.
And he was scared.	U kien jibża.
I'm not sure how.	M'inix ċert kif.
I need your help here	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek hawn
the first will do.	l-ewwel se tagħmel.
After that, no one knows what happened.	Wara dan, ħadd ma jaf x’ġara.
I can understand that	Kapaċi nifhem dan
I see it happening more and more	Nara li jiġri dejjem aktar
That's it.	Dik hija dik.
But he did his best.	Imma kien jagħmel li jista’.
Everyone leaves.	Kulħadd jitlaq.
I still can't believe it	Jien għadni ma nistax nemmen
Something that was not the same as before.	Xi ħaġa li ma kinitx l-istess bħal qabel.
Everyone should do this.	Kulħadd għandu jagħmel dan.
I knew no one was coming for us	Kont naf li ħadd ma kien ġej għalina
I went home and thought more about it	Mort id-dar u ħsibt aktar dwarha
Something that actually.	Xi ħaġa li fil-fatt.
Nothing was there.	Xejn ma kien hemm.
I love being with you.	Inħobb inkun miegħek.
I was the only one.	Jien kont l-uniku wieħed.
But another thing.	Imma ħaġa oħra.
With a man.	Ma' raġel.
I knew for sure	Jien kont naf li żgur
Whoever has.	Kull min għandu.
I didn't think I could do it alone	Ma kontx naħseb li seta’ jagħmel dan waħdu
I go where you want.	Immur fejn trid.
There is nothing to say.	M'hemm xejn xi ngħid.
I know there is a chance	Naf li hemm ċans ta’ dan
Same idea here.	L-istess idea hawn.
He needed to take this on someone.	Huwa kellu bżonn jieħu dan fuq xi ħadd.
Not being able to speak was wrong.	Li ma tistax titkellem kien ħażin.
I was happy.	Kont kuntent.
Maybe it can happen again.	Forsi jista’ jerġa’ jiġri.
Surely you see that this is the only way.	Żgur li tara li dan huwa l-uniku mod.
I had no idea what was wrong	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'kien ħażin
I wish he could come with us	Nixtieq li seta’ jiġi magħna
Lots of money	Ħafna flus
We did this year after year.	Dan għamilna sena wara sena.
Someone comes.	Jiġi xi ħadd.
It may have been years ago.	Jista 'jkun snin ilu.
He knows that, now.	Huwa jaf li, issa.
Did you hear ?.	Smajt?.
And for him, that would be enough.	U għalih, dan ikun biżżejjed.
It's bad.	Huwa ħażin.
A man has never been so with me	Raġel qatt ma kien hekk miegħi
No, never that.	Le, qatt dak.
I knew what was coming	Kont naf x’kien se jkun ġej
I wonder why they are here	Nistaqsi għaliex huma hawn
And probably will.	U probabbilment se.
There is something wrong with me.	Hemm xi ħaġa ħażina miegħi.
This is not just me talking.	Dan mhux jien nitkellem biss.
As I tell you.	Kif ngħidlek.
It's nothing.	Mhu xejn.
They are enough.	Huma biżżejjed.
You know that.	Taf li int.
He can say that something is wrong.	Jista’ jgħid li xi ħaġa hi ħażina.
I will not do that	Jien mhux se nagħmel dan
I really needed this job	Verament kelli bżonn dan ix-xogħol
Maybe that's what happened.	Forsi hekk ġara.
That she is not.	Li hi mhux.
He looks like a boy.	Jidher qisu tifel.
It was great.	Kien kbir.
I needed to make sure it was him	Kelli bżonn inkun ċert li kien hu
I have to really go	Ikolli verament sejjer
This is who she is.	Din hi min hi.
There was something for everyone.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
Not sure why.	Mhux ċert għaliex.
I’ve been there before.	Jien kont hemm qabel.
But from time to time.	Imma minn żmien għal żmien.
It seems to have passed from the outside.	Jidher li għadda minn barra.
He knows where he is coming from and where he is going.	Jaf minn fejn ġej u fejn sejjer.
This happened.	Dan ġara.
I had to say something before	I kellha għid xi ħaġa qabel
He was unable to speak.	Ma kienx kapaċi jitkellem.
He wanted that.	Huwa ried li.
It's just like.	Huwa biss bħal.
And from yours.	U minn tiegħek.
He's not here now.	Huwa mhux hawn issa.
It just goes on and on.	Hija biss tmur fuq u fuq.
What’s wrong with you.	X'inhu ħażin miegħek.
I knew this house.	Jien kont naf din id-dar.
I want to make something happen	Irrid nagħmel xi ħaġa jiġri
There is a lot of work on this.	Hemm ħafna xogħol fuq dan.
I want to know where I heard that	Irrid inkun naf fejn smajt dak
It is his first year here.	Hija l-ewwel sena tiegħu hawn.
He needed to.	Huwa kellu bżonn.
He will be so happy.	Huwa se jkun daqshekk kuntent.
No one was out.	Ħadd ma kien barra.
I did my job and he did his	Jien għamilt ix-xogħol tiegħi u hu għamel tiegħu
It should be more than that.	Għandu jkun aktar minn hekk.
It's good enough.	Huwa tajjeb biżżejjed.
I have to hear about this this week.	Għandi nisma' dwar dan din il-ġimgħa.
Everyone wants to do that.	Kulħadd irid jagħmel dan.
He could do that.	Huwa seta 'jagħmel dan.
Not so sure now.	Mhux daqshekk ċert issa.
It's easy to tell.	Huwa faċli li tgħid.
I couldn't tell anyone	Ma stajt ngħid lil ħadd
No one asked.	Ħadd ma staqsa.
I had never heard or seen anything like this before	Qatt ma kont smajt jew rajt xi ħaġa bħal din qabel
A year later passed	Sena wara għadda
I thought she did	Ħsibt li għamlet dan
I’m not home with anyone.	Jien m'iniex id-dar ma' ħadd.
I know what you're thinking	Naf x’qed jaħseb
I'll try again tomorrow	Se nerġa' nipprova għada
I couldn’t believe it.	Ma stajtx nemmen.
I thought I did too	Ħsibt li għamilt ukoll
Everything is something.	Kollox huwa xi ħaġa.
I want to be able to see things	Irrid inkun qed nara l-affarijiet
I couldn't hear anyone right now	Ma stajt nisma lil ħadd bħalissa
He knew what was coming next.	Kien jaf x’kien se jiġi wara.
He did.	Dan għamel.
But not often.	Imma mhux ħafna drabi.
And you know, that's good of me.	U inti taf, li tajjeb minni.
I didn’t even need to think about it	Lanqas ma kelli bżonn naħseb dwar dan
I can't do anything about it now	Ma nista nagħmel xejn dwarha issa
It happens here too.	Jiġri hawn ukoll.
I think it could be	Naħseb li jista 'jkun
I often thought the same thing	Ħafna drabi kont ħsibt l-istess
I couldn't.	Ma stajtx.
I never even knew he was there	Lanqas qatt ma kont naf li kien hemm
This is working together.	Dan qed jaħdem flimkien.
I haven’t been on anything for this past year	Jien ma kont fuq xejn għal din l-aħħar sena
So far, it seems.	Sa issa, jidher.
I couldn’t have both	Ma stajtx ikolli t-tnejn
He had another idea.	Kellu idea oħra.
You were saying.	Kont qed tgħid.
This was bad bad bad bad bad bad.	Dan kien ħażin ħażin ħażin ħażin ħażin.
It was ready.	Kien lest.
I already knew it wasn't going to help	Diġà kont naf li ma kinitx se tkun ta’ għajnuna
You take it.	Inti tieħu dan.
We don’t have that.	Aħna m'għandniex dak.
No one was around.	Ħadd ma kien madwar.
You can make your own.	Tista 'tagħmel tiegħek.
This is something no one has ever done before in years.	Din hija xi ħaġa li ħadd qatt ma għamel qabel fi snin.
But it’s not me to say.	Imma mhux jien li ngħid.
Well, not too hard.	Ukoll, mhux wisq diffiċli.
Just what you want to be doing.	Biss dak li trid tkun qed tagħmel.
That was it.	Dak x'kien.
She wants to be.	Hija trid tiġi.
I was waiting for you to tell me	Kont qed nistenna li tgħidli
I think about it a little more	Naħseb dwarha ftit aktar
I'm glad to hear that	Jien ferħan li nisma' dan
So many people.	Tant nies.
I think about it.	Naħseb dwarha.
I can go along with that too	Nista’ mmur flimkien ma’ dik ukoll
For me it was.	Għalija kien.
There is no one.	M'hemm ħadd.
I wanted to see that house	Ridt nara dik id-dar
I haven’t had one before	Ma kellix qabel
I have to try this.	Ikolli nipprova dan.
I thought you were my friend.	Ħsibt li inti ħabib tiegħi.
I didn’t know what I was going to tell you.	Ma kontx naf x'se ngħidlek.
I was going to do it alone	Kont se nagħmel dan waħdi
I still don't know how.	Għadni ma nafx kif.
This cannot be done.	Dan ma jistax isir.
There was nothing for me.	Ma kien hemm xejn għalija.
There, or there, or there.	Hemm, jew hemm, jew hemm.
You need one for a long time.	Għandek bżonn wieħed għal żmien twil.
I really thought about it	Verament ħsibt dwarha
I still think there is	Għadni naħseb li hemm
This is great.	Dan huwa kbir.
I just said it was an easy way	Għidt biss li kienet mod faċli
I’m not saying you can’t.	Mhux qed ngħid li ma tistax.
That came to that.	Li wasal għal dan.
I want to be better, everything	Irrid li tkun aħjar, dak kollu
He probably doesn’t know any better.	Probabbilment ma jafx aħjar.
I thought about it for a while	Ħsibt fuq ftit żmien
I didn't say anything	Jien ma għedt xejn
For three years it was nothing.	Għal tliet snin ma kienet xejn.
They were all on top of each other.	Kienu kollha fuq xulxin.
I had a lot of that.	Kelli ħafna minn hekk.
Or where is this.	Jew fejn hu dan.
I will definitely not stay there again	Żgur li mhux se nerġa’ noqgħod hemm
I need to try !.	Għandi bżonn nipprova!.
I was sure they felt mine	Kont ċert li ħassu tiegħi
But that’s not what happened here.	Imma dan mhux dak li ġara hawn.
But you weren’t there.	Imma int ma kontx hemm.
I couldn't understand what it was	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien
I'm really sorry for before, I'm so sorry	Verament jiddispjaċini għal qabel, jiddispjaċini għal kollox
I did a good job too	Jien għamilt xogħol tajjeb ukoll
I can’t really see anything else	Ma nistax verament nara xi ħaġa oħra
I think he's scared of me	Naħseb li jibża minni
I just know he has problems	Naf biss li għandu problemi
He can stay where he is.	Jista’ jibqa’ fejn hu.
I like to do things on my own	Inħobb nagħmel l-affarijiet waħdi
Out of many, one.	Minn ħafna, wieħed.
I understand a lot more now	Nifhem ħafna aktar issa
You can do the same.	Tista 'tagħmel l-istess.
You need something else.	Għandek bżonn xi ħaġa oħra.
No, it does nothing.	Le, dan ma jagħmel xejn.
I can do everything right.	Nista' nagħmel kollox tajjeb.
This happened here.	Dan ġara hawn.
It can always be better	Dejjem jista’ jkun aħjar
We have too many things.	Għandna wisq affarijiet.
Now, this is something like that.	Issa, din hija xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I don’t think I could have known that	Naħseb li ma stajtx taf hekk
I was worried too	Kont inkwetat ukoll
She needed more.	Hija kellha bżonn aktar.
They should do so.	Għandhom jagħmlu hekk.
It always was.	Dejjem kien.
But we are much more than that.	Imma aħna ħafna aktar minn hekk.
But a good man.	Imma raġel tajjeb.
She doesn’t always think so.	Hija mhux dejjem taħseb hekk.
But he knew it would be enough.	Imma kien jaf li kien se jkun biżżejjed.
It’s not what it seems.	Mhuwiex dak li jidher.
I should probably wait until morning	Probabbilment għandi nistenna sa filgħodu
And he left again.	U telaq mill-ġdid.
.	.
The first one did.	L-ewwel waħda ma.
I was never a problem for anyone.	Qatt ma kont problema għal ħadd.
I heard that.	Jien smajt dan.
What you want but don’t want.	Dak li trid imma ma tridx.
I will not do so.	Jien mhux se nagħmel hekk.
It’s not much, around.	Mhuwiex ħafna, madwar.
This can take a long time.	Dan jista' jieħu ħafna żmien.
I believe it was about a year ago	Nemmen li kien madwar sena ilu
I wasn't afraid either	Lanqas kont nibża’
But he is not happy.	Imma hu mhux kuntent.
She knew who we were.	Kienet taf min konna.
He gave it to everyone and asked very little	Ta lil kulħadd u talab ftit li xejn
He never was.	Hu qatt ma kien.
That was good to know.	Dan kien tajjeb li tkun taf.
If you come, come.	Jekk tiġi, tiġi.
It may have come out earlier.	Seta’ ħareġ qabel.
I probably didn’t even say that.	Probabbilment lanqas biss kont ngħid hekk.
Never think, think.	Qatt taħseb, taħseb.
So much work.	Tant xogħol.
I really don’t know	Jien verament ma nafx
It’s really a lot to eat.	Huwa verament ħafna li tiekol.
You have to be there.	Għandek tkun hemm.
I think about back home	Naħseb dwar lura d-dar
But we don’t have that.	Imma aħna m'għandniex dan.
I see no problem.	Ma nara l-ebda problema.
He who knows nothing.	Dak li ma jaf xejn.
It seemed easy.	Deher faċli.
Now that might just be good !.	Issa li jista 'jkun biss tajjeb!.
I will not go if she is there	Jien mhux se mmur jekk hi hemm
You are right when you say that you are a good person.	Għandek raġun meta tgħid li hija persuna tajba.
I didn’t think it all	Ma kontx ħsibt kollu
I didn’t know.	Ma kontx taf.
Something he hadn’t seen before.	Xi ħaġa li ma kienx ra qabel.
And you're a man.	U int raġel.
he said.	hu qal.
You never know who might be there.	Qatt ma tkun taf min jista’ jkun hemm.
I’ve always been that way	Jien dejjem kont hekk
Later, it was nothing.	Aktar tard, ma kien xejn.
I didn't want to be afraid	Ma ridtx nibża’
You can't do that.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan hekk.
No, it wasn't enough.	Le, ma kienx biżżejjed.
I can’t take more than that	Ma nistax nieħu aktar minn dan
I didn’t know anything about it	Jien ma kont naf xejn dwar dan
But it is happening.	Imma qed jiġri.
Who knows how long it will take.	Min jaf kemm se jibqa’ wara dak.
It was the same.	Kien l-istess.
This is the first time	Din hija l-ewwel darba
No one else has ever done that.	Ħadd ieħor qatt ma għamel hekk.
You have to be ready for this.	Trid tkun lest għal dan.
She was in.	Kienet fi.
That, of course, was very bad.	Dak, ovvjament, kien ħażin ħafna.
I didn’t know what to think or say	Ma kontx naf x'se naħseb jew ngħid
I wasn’t so worried	Jien ma kontx daqshekk inkwetat
He wanted to go home more than anything right now.	Ried imur lura d-dar aktar minn kull ħaġa bħalissa.
I don’t know why he does that.	Ma nafx għaliex jagħmel hekk.
But it looks bad.	Imma jidher ħażin.
I still didn’t want to be around anyone	Għadni ma ridt inkun madwar ħadd
It never will be.	Qatt mhu se jkun.
She knew it was time.	Kienet taf li wasal iż-żmien.
You didn't have time to talk to anyone.	Ma kellek ħin titkellem ma' ħadd.
I didn’t want to do anything wrong.	Ma ridtx nagħmel xejn ħażin.
I think he knows that.	Naħseb li jaf dan.
Nothing worth having really is.	Xejn ta' min ikollu tassew hu.
They are up to nothing good.	Huma sa xejn tajjeb.
He is obviously worried.	Huwa ovvjament inkwetat.
We were actually around before they were.	Konna fil-fatt madwar qabel ma kienu.
Definitely not alone.	Żgur li mhux waħdi.
I will do this for you	Jien se nagħmel dan għalik
I don’t think there is.	Ma naħsibx li hemm.
That's what happens.	Hekk jiġri.
I was thinking tomorrow	Kont naħseb għada
It went as well as it did.	Huwa mar tajjeb daqs kemm ta.
Maybe it was.	Forsi kienet.
A year is a long time	Sena hija żmien twil
This may be exactly how things are.	Dan jista 'jkun eżatt kif huma l-affarijiet.
You can do the same.	Inti tista 'tagħmel l-istess.
I have not seen or heard anyone.	Jien ma rajt jew smajt lil ħadd.
We were friends.	Konna ħbieb.
I didn't know you could do that	Ma kontx naf li tista’ tagħmel hekk
I can’t wait to go back	Ma nistax nistenna li mmur lura
If he ever does.	Jekk qatt jagħmel.
Okay, you can go.	Tajjeb, tista’ tmur.
Before too long it was done.	Qabel wisq żmien sar.
I can’t believe it happened.	Ma nistax nemmen li ġara.
That she does.	Li tagħmel hi.
They were nothing.	Ma kienu xejn.
I needed to sit down	Kelli bżonn noqgħod bilqiegħda
He will only speak here and there.	Huwa se jitkellem biss hawn u hemm.
This is where he lives today.	Dan huwa fejn jgħix illum.
I thought it went well	Ħsibt li mar tajjeb
I wonder where they are all today	Nistaqsi fejn huma kollha llum
He had to be his friend.	Kellu jkun ħabib tiegħu.
he asked.	staqsa.
I hadn’t really thought about it	Ma kontx verament ħsibt dwarha
We will never really know.	Qatt ma nkunu nafu tassew.
But here's a problem.	Imma hawn problema.
It never happened.	Qatt ma kien jiġri.
I wasn't even thinking about it	Lanqas kont qed naħseb
That’s how it started, really.	Hekk beda, tassew.
And you were right.	U kellek raġun.
I thought it was a good year.	Ħsibt li kienet sena tajba.
I think it might actually be good.	Naħseb li fil-fatt jista 'jkun tajjeb.
I know who they are now.	Naf min huma issa.
But not now.	Imma mhux issa.
I see no way I can do better than mine	Ma nara l-ebda mod kif nagħmel aħjar minn tiegħi
I was thinking how it should be for you.	Kont qed naħseb kif trid tkun għalik.
I was sure you were	Kont ċert li inti
Not that it was much.	Mhux li kien ħafna.
I just don't.	Jien biss ma.
Dude, all right.	Raġel, tajjeb.
I thought really fast	Ħsibt tassew malajr
She didn't know what to say.	Ma kinitx taf x’se tgħid.
You can do one or the other.	Tista' tagħmel waħda jew oħra.
But so are things.	Imma hekk ukoll huma l-affarijiet.
I hope it works that way	Nispera li hekk jaħdem
I'm just one person	Jien persuna waħda biss
You just know it's how you are.	Inti taf biss li huwa kif int.
I don't have much time	M'għandix ħafna ħin
But there is something you want to see.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa li trid tara.
I've seen it happen.	Stajt nara li jiġri.
He doesn’t know better.	Ma jafx aħjar.
And he never did anything afterwards.	U qatt ma għamel xejn wara.
Little by little they will do.	Ftit ftit se jagħmlu.
I knew there was something, but it wasn’t	Kont naf li kien hemm xi ħaġa, imma mhux hekk
And you ?.	U inti?.
I’m not sure what’s right	M'inix ċert x'inhu tajjeb
I was really scared and didn't know what to do.	Verament kont nibża’ u ma kontx naf x’se nagħmel.
It will be difficult.	Se jkun diffiċli.
I could see what he was doing	Stajt nara x’kien qed jagħmel
Being on the outside is not so bad.	Li tkun fuq barra mhix daqshekk ħażina.
That’s the only thing.	Dik hija l-unika ħaġa.
I already knew he wasn’t going to	Diġà kont naf li ma kienx se
Maybe it wasn't.	Forsi ma kienx.
So it was.	Hekk sar.
Just try to do it fast.	Ipprova biss tagħmel dan malajr.
I wasn’t surprised.	Jien ma kont sorpriż.
I haven’t heard anyone do that yet.	Għadni ma smajt lil ħadd jagħmel hekk.
He never knew where he came from.	Qatt ma kien jaf minn fejn ġie.
I knew she never would	Kont naf li hi qatt ma
I thought he did a good job.	Ħsibt li għamel xogħol tajjeb.
Just for a while.	Biss għal ftit.
It will take a long time.	Se jieħu ħafna żmien.
There will be no such thing.	Mhux se jkun hemm ħaġa bħal din.
I don't eat much	Ma tantx niekol
I was a little worried you know	Kont xi ftit inkwetat taf
Never more than that.	Qatt aktar minn hekk.
I have to eat a little something	Ikolli niekol ftit xi ħaġa
But we have a problem.	Imma għandna problema.
I want to tell you something once and for all	Irrid ngħidlek xi ħaġa darba għal dejjem
He never knew.	Hu qatt ma kien jaf.
There can never be another.	Qatt ma jista’ jkun hemm ieħor.
She did, but he didn't.	Hija għamlet, imma hu ma.
He did it, for me.	Huwa għamel dan, għalija.
I think about it, every so often	Naħseb dwar dan, kull tant drabi
I didn’t know there was so much.	Ma kontx naf li kien hemm tant.
I never wanted you alone	Jien qatt ridt int biss
I couldn't see or hear any more	Ma stajtx nara jew nisma aktar
I don’t want to sit down.	Ma rridx noqgħod bilqiegħda.
Maybe someday he will.	Forsi xi darba hu.
It wasn’t a big deal for him but it was for me.	Ma kienx xi ħaġa kbira għalih imma kien għalija.
I have done this a few times.	Dan għamilt xi ftit drabi.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha.
Time, as in, time.	Il-ħin, bħal fi, il-ħin.
Everything else was there.	Kollox ieħor kien hemm.
It was the first time she had ever had it.	Kienet l-ewwel darba li qatt kellha.
Later.	Aktar tard.
In fact, that's fine.	Fil-fatt, dak tajjeb.
But no help.	Imma l-ebda għajnuna.
I’ve been able to do a good job here	Jien stajt nagħmel xogħol tajjeb hawn
I hope she didn’t do anything from above	Jien nittama li ma għamlet xejn minn fuq
Very little work had been done, it seems.	Ftit li xejn kien sar xogħol, milli jidher.
It can't be here.	Ma jistax ikun hawn.
I'm glad I was here	Jien kuntent li kont hawn
It is a problem.	Hija problema.
There was nothing he could know.	Ma kien hemm xejn li jista’ jkun jaf.
This is the last.	Dan huwa l-aħħar.
I can't say for sure	Ma nistax ngħid żgur
It wasn’t me.	Ma kontx jien.
But so much more than that.	Imma tant aktar minn hekk.
I don’t think this is one.	Ma naħsibx li din hija waħda.
It would be hard not to be one.	Ikun diffiċli li ma tkunx waħda.
It was right, of course.	Kien kif suppost, ovvjament.
Something a boy would do.	Xi ħaġa li tifel kien jagħmel.
But there is nothing there.	Imma m'hemm xejn hemmhekk.
I need to do this.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan.
I didn’t do anything right	Jien ma għamilt xejn tajjeb
That nothing had happened.	Li ma kien ġara xejn.
I think you like it	Naħseb li tixtieq
I was the first person, now	Jien kont l-ewwel persuna, issa
I’m not the same as that	Jien mhux l-istess bħal dik
I'm pretty good at that	Jien li huwa pjuttost tajjeb
I wanted to go again, but I couldn't	Ridt immur mill-ġdid, imma ma stajtx
It was probably too little.	Probabbilment kien ftit wisq.
It's a very good one.	Huwa wieħed tajjeb ħafna.
I didn’t have to do that	Jien ma kellix nagħmel hekk
I know what happened.	Naf x’ġara.
That has to come first.	Dak irid jiġi l-ewwel.
Another thing to try.	Ħaġa oħra ta’ min jipprova.
You only have to do this once.	Għandek tagħmel dan darba biss.
I wonder why he is doing that	Nistaqsi għaliex qed jagħmel hekk
I will be in the back	Jien se nkun fuq wara
I actually thought it was good	Fil-fatt ħsibt li kien tajjeb
I do everything.	Jien nagħmel kollox.
I believe there is a time for everything	Nemmen li hemm żmien għal kollox
I know you want to talk.	Naf li trid titkellem.
I had just gone shopping	Kont għadni kemm mort nixtri
Well, there it was.	Ukoll, hemm kien.
I couldn't right now	Ma stajtx bħalissa
I can’t do everything alone forever.	Ma nistax nagħmel kollox waħdi għal dejjem.
There was nothing.	Ma kien hemm xejn.
I wasn’t happy about that	Ma kontx kuntent dwar dan
But for me, no.	Imma għalija, le.
I didn’t expect it to be there	Ma kontx nistenna li jkun hemm
But she was here.	Imma hi kienet hawn.
I can't tell you anymore	Ma nistax ngħidlek aktar
He can only do that.	Huwa jista 'biss jagħmel dan.
He knew.	Huwa kien jaf.
You have one job.	Għandek xogħol wieħed.
I didn't know what was wrong	Jien ma kontx naf x’kien ħażin
And we had.	U kellna.
And no, there's not much you can do about it.	U le, m'hemm xejn ħafna li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
I had never been so scared before	Qatt ma kont nibża daqshekk qabel
Everyone wanted to stay.	Kulħadd ried li jibqa’.
We want to do that as much as possible.	Irridu nagħmlu hekk kemm jista’ jkun.
You are not alone.	Int mhux int biss.
Or it may seem so at the time.	Jew jista 'jidher hekk dak iż-żmien.
Unless it's mine.	Sakemm mhux tiegħi.
I still can’t believe I did that, out here	Għadni ma nistax nemmen li għamilt hekk, hawn barra
I’m not sure how to do that.	M'inix ċert kif jagħmlu dan.
Everything was just great	Kollox kien biss kbir
I love both.	Jien inħobb it-tnejn.
I wonder what happened	Nistaqsi x’ġara
A very long time ago.	Żmien twil ħafna ilu.
It's probably too late	X'aktarx li diġà qiegħed tard
And it’s making the job harder.	U qed tagħmel ix-xogħol aktar diffiċli.
I have time to think tomorrow	Ikolli żmien biex naħseb għada
I couldn’t believe how much there was to do	Ma stajtx nemmen kemm kien hemm xi ħaġa li tagħmel
I went too far.	Jien mort wisq.
I did something good for someone.	Għamilt xi ħaġa tajba għal xi ħadd.
I never knew, really	Qatt ma kont naf, tassew
It seemed not quite mine.	Deher mhux pjuttost tiegħi.
We want to be better.	Irridu nkunu aħjar.
Or the problem.	Jew il-problema.
But that was not the problem.	Imma dik ma kinitx il-problema.
She knows she never will.	Hija taf li qatt mhu se.
I’m still not sure I am.	Għadni m'inix ċert jien.
No one was going to come for me.	Ħadd ma kien se jiġi għalija.
It seems like everything.	Jidher li kollox.
I know you will	Naf li inti se
Not the same thing.	Mhux l-istess ħaġa.
You will be.	Int tkun.
But after that, no more.	Imma wara dan, mhux aktar.
And it doesn’t.	U ma jagħmilx hekk.
Everyone knows what he's doing.	Kulħadd jaf x’qed jagħmel.
I want to know who did this	Irrid inkun naf min għamel dan
I’ve seen it that way too.	Jien rajt hekk ukoll.
Really.	Tassew.
It wasn’t that easy for me.	Ma kienx daqshekk faċli għalija.
It was here.	Kien hawn.
Unless you’re making one right now.	Sakemm ma tkunx qed tagħmel waħda issa.
I've been waiting.	Ilni nistenna.
I do this many times.	Dan nagħmel ħafna drabi.
And it will do.	U dan se jagħmel.
I could see it wasn't good	Stajt nara li ma kienx tajjeb
No, they never are.	Le, huma qatt ma.
If he had time.	Kieku kellu ħin.
He never appeared again.	Hu qatt ma deher aktar.
I always talked to him about it	Kont dejjem nitkellem miegħu dwarha
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Int għandek bżonn tkun taf biss dak li għandek bżonn tkun taf.
I heard this the first time	Smajt dan l-ewwel darba
I didn’t want you to know the whole truth	Ma ridtx li tkun taf il-verità kollha
I want you to come with me	Irrid li tiġi miegħi
I have seen this many times.	Rajt dan ħafna drabi.
I think you should be	Naħseb li għandek tkun
I can't believe that	Ma nistax nemmen li
I can't do it anymore.	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar.
It was as good as ever.	Kien tajjeb daqs qatt qabel.
I want to be there.	Irrid li tkun hemm.
My good friend has	Ħabib tajjeb tiegħi għandu
I think it will be good	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb
They are right to do so.	Huma għandhom raġun jagħmlu dan.
I can't eat this.	Ma nistax niekol dan.
This will tell you a lot	Dan se ngħidlek ħafna
I will not talk about it	Mhux se nitkellem dwarha
I like to do both.	Inħobb nagħmel it-tnejn.
For a while.	Għal xi żmien.
It doesn't look like that.	Ma jidhirx hekk.
No, really, he is.	Le, tassew, hu.
I don’t want to do that.	Ma rridx nagħmel dan.
Here was another.	Hawn kien ieħor.
It was late.	Kienet tard.
I'm not afraid	M'għandix nibża'
I already know where you are and everything	Diġà naf fejn int u kollox
This is definitely not the same.	Dan żgur mhux l-istess.
And it had to be.	U kellu jkun.
Not for you.	Mhux għal tiegħek.
It was not easy to see.	Ma kienx faċli biex tara.
I hope all is well with you	Nispera li kollox tajjeb miegħek
He just did the job.	Huwa biss għamel ix-xogħol.
I still can't speak	Għadni ma stajtx nitkellem
I will do this later today	Se nagħmel dan aktar tard illum
I try so hard.	Nipprova tant.
When she wasn’t thinking about other things.	Meta ma kinitx qed taħseb dwar affarijiet oħra.
I was expecting more	Kont qed nistenna aktar
I can’t believe he went	Ma nistax nemmen li mar
But it wasn’t.	Imma ma kinitx.
It's so good.	Huwa daqshekk tajjeb.
I didn’t even know it	Jien lanqas biss kont naf
That’s saying a lot.	Dak qed jgħid ħafna.
I wanted to know if he was leaving tomorrow	Ridt inkun naf jekk hux se jitlaq għada
He didn't seem to need to eat.	Deher li ma kellux bżonn jiekol.
I can't tell you how it happened	Ma nistax ngħidlek kif ġara
I can't go.	Ma nistax immur jien.
But only just.	Imma biss biss.
I want us to do that.	Nixtieq li nagħmlu hekk.
I did for a while.	Għamilt għal xi żmien.
This can go back very quickly.	Dan jista' jmur lura malajr ħafna.
I wouldn’t be here at all	Jien ma nkun hawn xejn
But he shouldn’t be surprised.	Imma m'għandux ikun sorpriż.
I didn't think of anything	Jien ma ħsibt xejn
I’m glad I do	Jien ferħan li nagħmel dan
I wonder how this will be.	Nistaqsi kif se jkun dan.
I hope it’s the same for you.	Nispera li huwa l-istess għalik.
We have to go back.	Irridu mmorru lura.
As she did.	Kif għamlet hi.
I couldn’t believe it was all it was	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien dak kollu li kien
It could have been both.	Seta’ kien it-tnejn.
I have never seen this before.	Qatt ma rajt dan qabel.
I came here to be with you	Ġejt hawn biex inkun miegħek
What he was doing at the time was good.	Dak li kien qed jagħmel dak iż-żmien kien tajjeb.
That’s never fun.	Dak qatt mhu gost.
Blah, blah blah.	Bla, bla bla.
It quickly passed.	Huwa malajr għadda.
I want to be what you want me to be	Nixtieq inkun dak li tixtieq
I can’t actually wait	Ma nistax nistenna fil-fatt
I am here for you when ready	Jiena hawn għalik meta lest
I go fast.	Immur malajr.
The house is still here.	Id-dar għadha hawn.
I couldn't understand what was going on	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien qed jiġri
It was great.	Kienet kbira.
And it’s getting harder, not easier.	U qed isir aktar diffiċli, mhux aktar faċli.
But we know better than that.	Imma nafu aħjar minn hekk.
There is no fun.	M'hemm l-ebda gost.
The dog is mine.	Il-kelb huwa tiegħi.
I don't have time to tell you about it	M'għandix ħin biex ngħidlek dwarha
It really is, it really is.	Huwa tassew, tassew hu.
I went back to the door	I lura lejn il-bieb
But he couldn’t help it.	Imma ma setax jgħin.
It looks good, he thought.	Jidher tajjeb, ħaseb.
I thought I wanted to be happy	Ħsibt li ridt li nkun kuntent
Maybe I heard.	Forsi smajt.
I didn’t want to tell you today	Ma ridtx ngħidlek illum
He left first.	Telaq l-ewwel.
I couldn’t go back home	Ma stajtx immur lura d-dar
It’s not for a loved one.	Mhuwiex għal wieħed iħobb.
You and he were one.	Int u hu konna wieħed.
It was like me.	Kien qisu lili.
As you did.	Kif għamilt int.
That’s good for us.	Dak tajjeb magħna.
If something like that ever happens.	Jekk xi ħaġa bħal dik qatt jiġri.
This really happens	Dan verament jiġri
I thought it was too much	Ħsibt li kien wisq
I was not as scared as I was worried	Ma kontx nibża’ daqskemm inkwetat
I hope you tell me soon	Nispera li tgħidli dalwaqt
I would do the same if I did	Nagħmel l-istess kieku jien
It was so good.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb.
I knew it and she knew it	Kont naf u hi kienet taf
Everyone was very happy.	Kulħadd kien ferħan ħafna.
He had a good year.	Kellu sena tajba.
I didn't want to see anyone	Ma ridt nara lil ħadd
She didn't.	Hija ma.
And something not you.	U xi ħaġa mhux int.
Like.	Bħal.
It must be.	Irid ikun.
I wasn’t sure what to say	Ma kontx ċert x'se ngħid
You are what he wants to be with him.	Int dak li jrid ikun miegħu.
This is not what it looks like today.	Dan mhux dak li jidher illum.
Now you have more time with us.	Issa għandek aktar ħin magħna.
I don't want to.	Irrid ma.
Not until you.	Mhux sakemm int.
Really good.	Tassew tajjeb.
I couldn't tell	Jien ma stajtx naf
I knew it would come	Kont naf li se tiġi
It’s not just money.	Mhuwiex flus biss.
Better you than me.	Aħjar int minni.
But there is nothing.	Imma m'hemm xejn.
This was not going properly.	Dan ma kienx sejjer kif suppost.
I thought I wanted to be my friend	Ħsibt li ridt tkun ħabib tiegħi
Or one has to work.	Jew wieħed għandu jaħdem.
I love what he is doing	Inħobb dak li qed jagħmel
You too.	Int ukoll.
I wasn’t, I can’t go back	Jien ma kontx, ma nistax immur lura
This has happened before.	Dan ġara qabel.
It's just, you've been there.	Huwa biss, inti kont hemm.
I didn’t know he was your friend.	Ma kontx naf li kien ħabib tiegħek.
I can't say anything better about anyone	Ma nista’ ngħid xejn aħjar dwar ħadd
I was never happy until I did	Qatt ma kont kuntent sakemm ma nagħmel
He wanted to be one when he was a boy.	Ried ikun wieħed meta kien tifel.
I shouldn’t have come back here	Ma kellix ġejt lura hawn
Maybe you don’t want to be, but you are.	Forsi ma tridx tkun, imma int.
I would have been too	Jien kont inkun ukoll
You were someone else.	Int kont xi ħadd ieħor.
I was just talking to myself	Kont qed nitkellem biss miegħi
This is not going to happen here.	Dan mhux se jiġri hawn.
He never did.	Qatt ma kien jagħmel hekk.
When we can do that, we should do it.	Meta nistgħu nagħmlu hekk, għandna nagħmlu hekk.
I wanted it to be mine	Ridt li jkun tiegħi
Okay, he thought, so be it.	Tajjeb, ħaseb, hekk għandu jkun.
He wanted to talk a lot.	Ried ħafna jitkellem.
Better not.	Aħjar ma jkunx.
Only his dog.	Biss il-kelb tiegħu.
And she was doing it for him.	U kienet tagħmel dan għalih.
I’m not and I can’t be.	Jien mhux u ma nistax inkun.
But I think everyone did well.	Imma naħseb li kulħadd għamel tajjeb.
I hope it would.	Jien nittama li kieku.
I think that was it	Naħseb li kien hekk
I don't know much more than that, 'he said.	Ma nafx wisq aktar minn hekk,’ qal.
I just came to talk to you	Ġejt biss biex nitkellem miegħek
I really need to talk to him	Għandi verament bżonn nitkellem miegħu
It was the only idea.	Kienet l-unika idea.
I'm sure of it.	Jien ċert minn hekk.
I was so out of here	Kont tant barra minn hawn
She wants to know what happened.	Hija trid tkun taf x'ġara.
I was there myself	Jien kont hemm jien
I didn’t know who he was	Ma kontx naf min kien
I never thought about it much	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha ħafna
Good or bad.	Tajjeb jew ħażin.
Everything is still.	Kollox għadu.
I will not talk about this further	Mhux se nitkellem aktar dwar dan
It's this.	Huwa dan.
Needless to say	Ma kellix bżonn ngħid ħafna
I want to know what she wants	Irrid inkun naf xi trid hi
I know I thought I did	Naf li ħsibt li għamilt
I haven't been there in years	Ilni ma kont hemm snin
I am very happy with you	Jien kuntent ħafna miegħek
It doesn’t have to be bad.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun ħażin.
You, not me.	Int, mhux jien.
I knew no one ever would.	Kont naf li ħadd qatt ma.
I know what you need.	Naf dak li għandek bżonn.
A man who was nothing like a man	Raġel li ma kien xejn bħal raġel
To sit down.	Biex toqgħod bilqiegħda.
It's my way.	Huwa mod tiegħi.
I wasn't too happy either	Lanqas ma kont kuntent wisq
We are together.	Aħna flimkien.
Now, like never before, he lives.	Issa, bħal qatt qabel, jgħix.
I think this is it	Naħseb li dan hu
I need to really think about it	Għandi bżonn naħseb verament dwar dan
I don’t know what it is.	Ma nafx dak li hu.
I have to do that.	Għandi nagħmel hekk.
This too, needs some outside help.	Dan ukoll, jeħtieġ xi għajnuna minn barra.
I hope there is none of this	Nispera li ma jkun hemm xejn minn dan
Which is pretty much what happened.	Li huwa pjuttost dak li ġara.
I knew it wasn't going to be an easy one	Kont naf li ma kinitx se tkun waħda faċli
I come from.	Jien ġej minn.
This is not a big deal.	Din mhix xi ħaġa kbira.
I don’t think it was his idea.	Ma naħsibx li kienet idea tiegħu.
I don't have to do this for you	M'għandix għalfejn nagħmel dan għalik
I have to try to talk	Għandi nipprova nitkellem
You never take money.	Qatt ma tieħu flus.
He was trying too hard.	Kien qed jipprova wisq.
I didn't have time to be afraid	Ma kellix ħin biex nibża’
There was something else, something that was not there before.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra, xi ħaġa li ma kinitx hemm qabel.
But it will take something like that.	Imma se tieħu xi ħaġa bħal dik.
It was just a thing.	Kienet biss ħaġa.
I really hope you can as well	Verament nittama li inti tista 'kif hekk
I’m not the only one who thinks so	Jien mhux l-uniku wieħed li naħseb hekk
These are people who do the same.	Dawn huma nies li jagħmlu l-istess.
I was going small.	Kont sejjer żgħir.
I couldn't think of how.	Ma stajtx taħseb kif.
That's who you are.	Dak hu li int.
A few years later, another passed	Ftit snin wara, għadda ieħor
And that's just what some people won't do.	U huwa biss dak li xi nies mhux se jagħmlu.
I hope you think so too	Nispera li taħseb hekk ukoll
I knew I could never be around again	Kont naf li qatt ma jista 'jiġi madwar mill-ġdid
I know this is yours	Naf li dan huwa tiegħek
I didn't really want to be here	Ma tantx ridt inkun hawn
In fact, he didn’t have to.	Fil-fatt, ma kellux għalfejn.
It will definitely be a great one.	Żgur li se tkun waħda kbira.
You wanted me.	Inti ridt lili.
I would have been so happy	Kont inkun daqshekk kuntent
And it's just that	U huwa biss li
He knew better than she did.	Hu kien jaf aħjar minn hi.
I have to do this	Ikolli nagħmel dan
I never want to do that.	Qatt ma nixtieq nagħmel hekk.
I can’t believe that’s your first job	Ma nistax nemmen li dak hu l-ewwel xogħol tiegħek
I’m usually not like that	Jien normalment mhux bħal dan
It was so.	Kien hekk.
I did the same, but heard nothing	Jien għamilt l-istess, imma ma smajt xejn
I sat down.	I poġġa bilqiegħda.
There is more than one way to do this.	Hemm aktar minn mod wieħed biex tagħmel dan.
Only he could speak.	Kieku biss jista' jitkellem.
I already knew where I was going	Diġà kont naf fejn se mmur
I couldn't tell what he was thinking	Ma stajtx ngħid x’kien qed jaħseb
And it actually doesn’t.	U fil-fatt ma jagħmilx hekk.
And he is waiting right now.	U qiegħed jistenna bħalissa.
Well, we never did.	Ukoll, qatt ma għamilna hekk.
I will be there soon	Jien se nkun hemm dalwaqt
I also know, that will be good for me	Naf ukoll, li se jkun tajjeb għalija
It looked good to him.	Deher tajjeb għalih.
They never will.	Huma qatt ma se.
He is a busy man.	Huwa raġel okkupat.
I didn't know what to say	Ma kontx naf x’se ngħid
If anyone is interested.	Jekk xi ħadd hu interessat.
He wants to go.	Irid imur.
Everything about it was.	Kollox dwarha kien.
I was very tired.	Kont għajjien ħafna.
I'm sure you want your house back	Jiena ċert li trid id-dar tiegħek lura
I would never say anything like that.	Qatt ma ngħid xi ħaġa bħal dik.
You can't go to work as a man.	Ma tistax tmur tagħmel xogħol ta’ raġel.
Today I had a good time with you	Illum kelli żmien tajjeb miegħek
I never wanted to come to this	Qatt ma ridt li jasal għal dan
Not even around that time.	Lanqas madwar dak iż-żmien.
I wasn’t ready	Jien ma kontx lest
Really there.	Verament hemm.
I have no idea why this is	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex dan hu
This may or may not be a good thing.	Din tista’ tkun xi ħaġa tajba jew le.
One thing is that.	Ħaġa waħda hija dik.
Here is your home.	Hawn id-dar tiegħek.
Not you, no, not you.	Mhux int, le, mhux int.
I have to think about something	Ikolli naħseb dwar xi ħaġa
Too late for him too.	Tard wisq għalih ukoll.
I can’t tell you why right now	Ma nistax ngħidlek għaliex bħalissa
Everyone knew that.	Kulħadd kien jaf li.
Don’t be so into that.	M'għandekx tkun hekk dwar dan.
This should not take too long.	Dan m'għandux jieħu wisq żmien.
I know where we were.	Naf fejn konna.
I really think you should go now	Verament naħseb li għandek tmur issa
I wasn’t much better	Ma kontx wisq aħjar
I was ready to listen to everything he had to say	Kont lest nisma’ kull ma kellu xi jgħid
No one was allowed to leave.	Ħadd ma seta’ jitlaq.
It would be the morning above.	Ikun filgħodu hawn fuq.
It’s hard for me to take that you really are here.	Huwa diffiċli għalija li nieħu li int verament hawn.
I can’t say much more	Ma nistax ngħid ħafna aktar
And not here.	U mhux hawn.
I'm not some people.	Jien mhux xi nies.
I had to know.	Kelli nkun naf.
To make money.	Biex tagħmel flus.
That’s not a good thing.	Dik mhix xi ħaġa tajba.
He came out.	Huwa ħareġ.
We are like everyone else.	Aħna bħal kulħadd.
I think it says it all	Naħseb li jgħid kollox
He looked good.	Huwa deher tajjeb.
I didn't want to be here	Ma ridtx inkun hawn
I wanted you out of me.	Jien ridt int barra minni.
I didn't know what it was	Ma kontx naf x’kien
I was just waiting for this.	Kont qed nistenna biss dan.
I actually need some fun today	Fil-fatt għandi bżonn xi gost illum
I think there is something to see	Naħseb li hemm xi ħaġa li għandek tara
I have already done this	Diġà għamilt dan
Like, you just have to.	Bħal, għandek biss.
I didn't want that to happen again	Ma ridtx li dan jerġa’ jiġri
I shouldn't think so	M'għandix naħseb hekk
Well, no it's not.	Ukoll, le mhuwiex.
That you want.	Li trid.
And it takes a while.	U jieħu ftit.
Maybe he hadn't eaten in a long time.	Forsi kien ilu ma jiekol.
I had a few friends there	Kelli ftit ħbieb hemmhekk
And how I was.	U kif kont.
But he would be back in the morning.	Imma kien ikun lura filgħodu.
I want to see myself	Irrid nara jien
I think he will come with us	Naħseb li se tiġi magħna
It's better now.	Huwa aħjar issa.
Bad thing.	Ħaġa ħażina.
I do it myself.	Jien nagħmel dan jien.
I can't see it happening	Ma nistax nara jiġri
Come on, now.	Ejja, issa.
This week here, that week there.	Din il-ġimgħa hawn, dik il-ġimgħa hemm.
That was a big deal for me.	Dik kienet ħaġa kbira għalija.
This is what we should do.	Dan huwa dak li għandna nagħmlu.
I didn't belong to anyone	Jien ma kont ta’ ħadd
Most of the time, it was both.	Ħafna drabi, kien it-tnejn.
But other than that, you're good to go.	Imma barra minn hekk, int sejjer tajjeb.
This is difficult.	Dan huwa diffiċli.
He agreed it was a good idea.	Huwa qabel li kienet idea tajba.
It comes so.	Jiġi hekk.
I do now.	Jien issa nagħmel.
I’m glad you’re here to see this.	Jien kuntent li qiegħed hawn biex tara dan.
It's a great thing.	Hija ħaġa kbira.
He was just playing with us.	Kien għadu kif jilgħab magħna.
He wasn’t going to take that back.	Hu ma kienx se jieħu dak lura.
I think he should talk about it.	Naħseb li għandu jitkellem dwarha.
He's not sure he can.	Huwa mhux ċert li jista '.
I wish you had thought about this before	Nixtieq li tkun ħsibt dwar dan qabel
Everyone was going.	Kulħadd kien sejjer.
Someone had to be there.	Xi ħadd kellu jkun hemm.
He wanted to talk now.	Ried jitkellem issa.
But she knew he was there.	Imma kienet taf li kien hemm.
Someone talk to him.	Xi ħadd jitkellem miegħu.
It really looked bad	Verament ħares ħażin
I knew exactly who he was	Kont naf eżatt min kien
I can do anything I can do.	Nista' nagħmel kull ħaġa li tista' tagħmel.
I will never do anything	Qatt mhu se nagħmel xejn
There is no other way	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor
I have no idea where, or if, they are.	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn, jew jekk, huma.
I was glad we were friends now	Kont ferħan li konna ħbieb issa
We have to be.	Għandna nkunu.
Like very much.	Bħal ħafna ħafna.
I actually had to do the work	Fil-fatt kelli nagħmel ix-xogħol
No one knew where she was.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn kienet.
I will be fine	Jien se nkun tajjeb
Maybe he was gone.	Forsi kien telaq.
Nothing seemed the same to me.	Xejn ma deher l-istess għalija.
Not a big deal.	Mhux ħaġa kbira.
I hadn’t thought about it for too long	Jien ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan għal żmien twil wisq
I wanted to see where.	Ridt nara fejn.
I didn’t know he was out, and back	Ma kontx naf li kien barra, u lura
She was there.	Kienet hemm.
She just knew.	Kienet taf biss.
I just need to talk to you about something	Għandi bżonn biss nitkellem miegħek dwar xi ħaġa
What he was and what he did.	Dak li kien u dak li għamel.
I wasn’t sure of anything else	Ma kont ċert minn xejn aktar
He didn’t have to do that, but he did.	Ma kellux għalfejn jagħmel dan, imma hekk għamel.
I didn't stand a chance	Ma kellix ċans
I don't have much time.	M'għandix ħafna ħin.
It's so much fun.	Huwa daqshekk gost.
I haven’t heard anything besides	Ma smajt xejn barra minn hekk
It’s probably all you know.	Huwa probabbilment dak kollu li taf.
Everyone wants to be happy.	Kulħadd irid ikun kuntent.
He was the last person to arrive.	Kien l-aħħar persuna li wasal.
And that was a good thing for him.	U dik kienet ħaġa tajba għalih.
I didn’t want to sit at home doing nothing.	Ma ridtx noqgħod id-dar ma nagħmel xejn.
He is not doing this for you.	Hu mhux qed jagħmel dan għalik.
I really need to talk to you about some things	Għandi verament bżonn nitkellem miegħek dwar xi affarijiet
I can talk about this forever	Nista’ nitkellem għal dejjem dwar dan
I just want to be home	Irrid inkun biss id-dar
It’s just being what we all are here.	Huwa biss qed ikun dak li kulħadd aħna hawn.
I don’t want this on anyone	Jien ma nixtieq dan lil ħadd
I can't go any further	Ma nistax immur aktar
I think they are.	Naħseb li huma.
He says nothing about it.	Hu ma jgħid xejn dwar dan.
I didn't know what was wrong with me	Ma kontx naf x’kien ħażin miegħi
I have never done so before.	Qatt ma għamilt hekk qabel.
You can tell the truth.	Tista 'tgħid il-verità.
He’s a good teacher, you know.	Huwa għalliem tajjeb, taf.
I didn’t see any of that	Jien ma rajt xejn minn hekk
I think you know that too.	Naħseb li int taf hekk ukoll.
I’ve always been that way.	Dejjem kont hekk.
But it certainly happened.	Imma żgur li ġara.
There was another and another and another.	Kien hemm ieħor u ieħor u ieħor.
I don’t think it will do much of anything.	Ma naħsibx li se tagħmel ħafna minn xi ħaġa.
But it wasn’t going to be that way.	Imma ma kienx se jkun hekk.
I couldn’t talk anymore.	Ma stajtx nitkellem aktar.
I have to try this.	Ikolli nipprova dan.
It wasn't one he wanted, so much so that he knew.	Ma kienx wieħed li ried, tant li kien jaf.
This is just what happened.	Dan huwa biss dak li ġara.
I never have, not really.	Qatt ma għandi, mhux verament.
Me, and always here	Jien, u dejjem hawn
I have never heard of such a thing.	Qatt ma smajt xi ħaġa bħal din.
I want to do that.	Irrid nagħmel hekk.
And maybe again.	U forsi mill-ġdid.
I have to.	Ikolli.
I know it’s hard for you too	Naf li huwa diffiċli għalik ukoll
But it is not a good idea.	Imma mhix idea tajba.
But how do I do that?	Imma kif nagħmel dan?.
I haven't been there in a long time	Ilni ma nkun hemm fuq
I had nothing to say.	Ma kellix xi ngħid.
I think it was pretty bad	Naħseb li kien pjuttost ħażin
It’s always a bad idea.	Hija dejjem idea ħażina.
I'm still waiting.	Għadni nistenna.
Come to me.	Ejja għandi.
He could not leave.	Ma setax jitlaq.
I want you to be really happy	Irrid li tkun tassew ferħan
No one did anything.	Ħadd ma għamel xejn.
In fact, he needed to sit down.	Fil-fatt, kellu bżonn joqgħod bilqiegħda.
We are not together.	Aħna mhux flimkien.
I have an early morning	Għandi filgħodu kmieni
I have to talk to someone.	Jien għandi nitkellem ma' xi ħadd.
That's so good.	Li tant tajjeb.
It didn’t have to be.	Ma kellux ikun.
He would have to think about it.	Huwa jkollu jaħseb dwar dan.
He could not stay behind.	Ma setax jibqa’ lura.
I wasn't even sure what to say	Lanqas ma kont ċert x’se ngħid
I can't hear very well here	Ma nistax nisma' tajjeb ħafna hawn
I was going to say more.	Jien kont ngħid aktar.
It was getting harder and harder for me to make my way.	Kien qed isir aktar u aktar diffiċli biex nagħmel mod tiegħi.
Definitely will.	Żgur li se.
It’s too much work.	Huwa xogħol kbir wisq.
He knew nothing more.	Ma kien jaf xejn aktar.
It would be a problem if.	Tkun problema jekk.
I also know he is right.	Naf ukoll li għandu raġun.
I heard nothing.	Smajt xejn.
This happens often.	Dan jiġri spiss.
You can tell that in the room	Tista 'tgħid li fil-kamra
As soon as you can.	Kemm tista’ malajr.
He's not worried.	Hu mhux inkwetat.
I have to talk about something	Għandi nitkellem dwar xi ħaġa
Well here you go.	Ukoll hawn inti tmur.
He will not buy again here.	Mhux se jerġa' jixtri hawn.
I think it has to be something else	Naħseb li trid tkun xi ħaġa oħra
That's about it.	Dak hu dwar dan.
It's great for you.	Huwa kbir għalik.
It won’t work anymore.	Mhux se jaħdem aktar.
I have to do that.	Ikolli nagħmel hekk.
But not so sure.	Imma mhux hekk żgur.
I just thought that, you know	Ħsibt biss li, taf
He is such a good man.	Huwa daqshekk raġel tajjeb.
You have to do this job.	Int trid tagħmel dan ix-xogħol.
And I do, of course.	U jien, ovvjament.
I want you ready to go	Irrid li inti lest biex tmur
I eat, just like any other person	Jien niekol, bħal kull persuna oħra
Tell anyone what you saw.	Għid lil ħadd minn dak li rajt.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha.
I’m really glad to be here now	Jien tassew kuntent li nkun hawn issa
Maybe you were right.	Forsi kellek raġun.
A man can only stay at home for a long time	Raġel jista 'biss joqgħod id-dar għal żmien twil
I didn’t think so	Ma kontx ħsibt dan
We must and must be able to do better.	Irridu u għandna nkunu kapaċi nagħmlu aħjar.
Tired of trying to figure out what you're doing here.	Għajjien nipprova nifhem x'qed tagħmel hawn.
He couldn’t do it alone.	Ma setax jagħmel dan waħdu.
Well, not everyone.	Ukoll, mhux kulħadd.
I don’t even want to know how bad it is.	Lanqas irrid inkun naf kemm hu ħażin.
Nobody knows the house.	Ħadd ma jaf id-dar.
Definitely you should.	Żgur li għandek.
I want something big with you	Irrid xi ħaġa kbira miegħek
This should make things easier and not harder.	Dan għandu jagħmel l-affarijiet aktar faċli mhux aktar diffiċli.
That was the last thing he needed.	Dik kienet l-aħħar ħaġa li kellu bżonn.
But they are just things.	Imma huma biss affarijiet.
They are quite.	Huma pjuttost.
This was not happening.	Dan ma kienx qed jiġri.
I was afraid of what he would do next	Kont nibża’ minn dak li kien se jagħmel wara
This would be better.	Dan aħjar ikun tajjeb.
It seems like I never have time	Jidher li qatt ma għandi ħin
But maybe.	Imma forsi.
But it doesn’t have to be all work.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun xogħol kollu.
But we have little time.	Imma għandna ftit ħin.
I was very happy.	Kont kuntent ħafna.
I said nothing like that.	Jien għedt xejn bħal dan.
This is a year later. 	Din hija sena wara. 
I really didn’t think much of it.	Verament ma kontx naħseb ħafna.
You know he is.	Taf li hu.
That's a good boy.	Dak tifel tajjeb.
I don’t think it will.	Ma naħsibx li se.
I want to know everything	Irrid inkun naf kollox
I don't see anyone with you	Jien ma nara lil ħadd miegħek
He had done wrong and he knew.	Huwa kien għamel ħażin u kien jaf.
But there was no need.	Imma ma kienx hemm bżonn.
I couldn't believe it was her	Ma stajtx nemmen li kienet hi
I just hope it will be soon	Jien biss nittama li jkun dalwaqt
Not so beautiful anymore.	Mhix daqshekk sabiħa aktar.
He always has been.	Huwa dejjem kien.
At the time, it probably was.	Dak iż-żmien, probabbilment kien.
It happened again.	Ġara mill-ġdid.
We know what it is about.	Aħna nafu dak li hu dwar.
I shouldn't be telling you this	M'għandix inkun qed ngħidlek dan
That we were the same.	Li konna l-istess.
It had to be good, it had to be.	Kellu jkun tajjeb, kellu jkun.
I'm so sorry, this is just who he is	Jiddispjaċini ħafna, dan hu biss min hu
I have some time around noon	Għandi ftit ħin madwar nofsinhar
I have no idea where I am going.	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn sejjer.
I knew it wasn’t	Kont naf li ma kienx
I'm just glad.	Jien ferħan biss.
This is what they do.	Dan huwa dak li jagħmlu.
Really, be surprised.	Tassew, tkun sorpriż.
It’s good for us.	Huwa tajjeb għalina.
She was watching.	Hija kienet qed tara.
It’s time for him.	Wasal iż-żmien għalih.
He was good to me.	Kien tajjeb miegħi.
Good good is better	Tajjeb tajjeb huwa aħjar
I had to wait for this	I kellha nistenna dan
You are not your job.	M'intix ix-xogħol tiegħek.
And this is it.	U dan huwa dan.
I knew you would never be alone	Kont naf li int qatt ma tiġi waħdek
I just know it will	Naf biss li se
I think a lot of people were tired	Naħseb li ħafna nies kienu għajjien
That's all.	Dak huma kollha.
There is nothing you can do right now.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel bħalissa.
And for me, that’s saying something.	U għalija, dan qed ngħid xi ħaġa.
I would be better off at home.	Inkun aħjar id-dar.
And in the afternoon as well.	U wara nofsinhar ukoll.
I couldn’t be so alone	Ma stajtx inkun daqshekk waħdi
It could be someone you might think.	Jista 'jkun xi ħadd li inti tista' taħseb.
I want you to stay	Nixtieq li inti toqgħod
I am very sorry for all this.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal dan kollu.
I wasn’t even around when it happened	Lanqas ma kont madwar meta ġara
I have no problem with that, good for you.	M'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan, tajjeb għalik.
You can do that too, you know.	Tista’ tagħmel dan ukoll, taf.
It seems that from.	Jidher li minn.
I wasn’t sure where she was at home	Ma kontx ċert fejn kienet id-dar
Everything looked good.	Kollox deher tajjeb.
I didn’t know he was going to get to this	Ma kontx naf li se jasal għal dan
No one had ever seen one.	Ħadd qatt ma kien ra wieħed.
Not a good one, a great one.	Mhux waħda tajba, waħda kbira.
Nor is it great.	Lanqas huwa kbir.
It would be right.	Ikun raġun.
I think he was doing the same to us	Naħseb li kien qed jagħmel l-istess magħna
And last.	U l-aħħar.
I understand he needs time to think	Nifhem li għandu bżonn iż-żmien biex jaħseb
He can do whatever he wants.	Jista’ jagħmel dak kollu li jrid jagħmel.
I wanted the truth.	Ridt il-verità.
He is a great man.	Huwa raġel kbir.
This is happening.	Dan qed jiġri.
I know what you mean	Naf dak li trid tgħid
I’ve seen this before	Rajt dan qabel
There is more.	Hemm aktar.
Everyone was leaving.	Kulħadd kien jitlaq.
Not so tired.	Mhux daqshekk għajjien.
I understand why they do that	Nifhem għaliex jagħmlu dan
That was great.	Dak kien kbir.
Well, you know my friends.	Ukoll, inti taf ħbieb tiegħi.
I need to hear what happened	Għandi bżonn nisma’ x’ġara
I wonder why he was here last night	Nistaqsi għaliex kien hawn ilbieraħ filgħaxija
You can't be.	Inti ma tistax tkun.
I'm not sure about anything	M'inix ċert dwar xejn
Everyone wanted to help.	Kulħadd ried jgħin.
She wants to see how it was done.	Hija trid tara kif sar.
Not many people are.	Mhux ħafna nies huma.
You said it would be hard, and it was.	Inti għidt li jkun diffiċli, u kien.
I had to do this for you	Kelli nagħmel dan għalik
Whatever that is.	Tkun xi tkun dik.
I wasn’t so surprised.	Ma kontx daqshekk sorpriż.
And many already have.	U ħafna diġà għandhom.
I love being there	Inħobb li nkun hemm
I want to know what's going on	Irrid inkun naf x'qed jiġri
Does anyone else think this is a bad idea ?.	Xi ħadd ieħor jaħseb li din hija idea ħażina?.
Now she wasn’t doing it for him.	Issa hi ma kinitx tagħmel dan għalih.
This is a must do !.	Din hija trid tagħmel!.
I was not here	Jien ma kontx hawn
I hope you are having fun	Nispera li qed tieħu gost
It's a lot to look forward to.	Huwa ħafna li wieħed jistenna.
He thinks everyone is like that.	Jaħseb li kulħadd huwa hekk.
Well, now you see.	Ukoll, issa qed tara.
He was happy to do that.	Kien kuntent li jagħmel dan.
But he didn't tell anyone.	Imma ma qal lil ħadd.
She knew why.	Kienet taf għaliex.
It doesn't have to be that way.	M'għandux ikun hekk.
Well, so be it, he thought.	Ukoll, hekk ikun, ħaseb.
He didn’t even look happy.	Lanqas deher ferħan.
First I needed to know more	L-ewwel kelli bżonn inkun naf aktar
I hope you are having a good time	Nittama li qed tieħu ħin tajjeb
Everything will be fine, you will see.	Kollox se jkun tajjeb, se tara.
He didn't have to think about it.	Ma kellux għalfejn jaħseb dwarha.
That’s not our problem.	Dik mhix il-problema tagħna.
But no one could leave.	Imma ħadd ma seta’ jitlaq.
Let's not go.	Mhux ejja mmorru.
Well maybe another time.	Ukoll forsi żmien ieħor.
What happened next, he did.	Dak li ġara wara, għamel.
It's my job.	Huwa xogħol tiegħi.
I think you will be fine	Naħseb li inti tkun tajjeb
There is nothing he does not know.	M'hemm xejn li ma jafx.
I said that would be good	Għidt li dan ikun tajjeb
But there was a lot wrong.	Imma kien hemm ħafna ħażin.
I thought you were better than this	Ħsibt li int aħjar minn dan
I'm not going back.	Jien mhux se lura.
I think she would go to this school, actually	Naħseb li kienet tmur din l-iskola, fil-fatt
I was supposed to be happy	Jien suppost kelli nkun kuntent
They always felt so scared.	Dejjem ħassu daqshekk jibża’.
I have to say loved.	Għandi ngħid iħobb.
That will be good.	Dak se jkun tajjeb.
You are always there for me.	Int dejjem hemm għalija.
I was worried about everything	Kont inkwetat dwar kollox
He prayed often enough.	Talab spiss biżżejjed.
I need time to understand	Għandi bżonn iż-żmien biex nifhem
I needed to know more, much more	Kelli bżonn inkun naf aktar, ħafna aktar
I know he does.	Naf li jagħmel.
I know you can't do that	Naf li ma tistax tagħmel dan
He said.	Hu qal.
But not a good one.	Imma mhux waħda tajba.
I know what you're doing	Naf x'qed tagħmel
I will understand a way out of this for us	Se nifhem mod minn dan għalina
What is that about.	X'inhu dak dwar.
No one else knew what was going on there.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien jaf x’kien qed jiġri hemmhekk.
Not even on it works well.	Lanqas fuq jaħdem tajjeb.
I can be anything.	Jien nista' nkun tkun xi tkun.
Everything worth doing is good.	Kull ħaġa ta’ min tagħmel tajjeb li tagħmel tajjeb.
And it sure helps.	U żgur li jgħin.
I know you can do both	Naf li tista’ tagħmel it-tnejn
It was something else that was behind it.	Kienet xi ħaġa oħra li kienet wara.
Very happy with this.	Ferħan ħafna b'dan.
To think of something.	Biex taħseb xi ħaġa.
I know it’s hard for you	Naf li huwa diffiċli għalik
You're just worried.	Inti biss inkwetat.
And this is it !.	U dan hu!.
I thought it was really great	Ħsibt li kien tassew kbir
Back before.	Lura qabel.
I’ve actually done this before and had a few problems	Fil-fatt għamilt dan qabel u kelli ftit problemi
I didn’t even know how it happened	Lanqas kont naf kif ġara
Chances are, you too.	Ċans, int ukoll.
He knew how to do it.	Kien jaf kif jagħmel dan.
The problem is that there is no way to know this for a while.	Il-problema hi li m'hemm l-ebda mod kif tkun taf dan għal xi żmien.
I’m not sure what’s right.	M'inix ċert x'inhu tajjeb.
I don’t know what’s wrong.	Ma nafx x'inhu ħażin.
How to speak.	Kif titkellem.
Not for long.	Mhux għal żmien twil.
I want you to think about how it was	Irrid li taħseb dwar kif kien dan
But it hadn’t happened.	Imma ma kienx ġara.
Or so it seemed.	Jew hekk deher.
He needed more.	Huwa kellu bżonn aktar.
I wasn’t too worried about it	Ma kontx wisq inkwetat dwarha
I just don’t know.	Jien biss ma nafx.
It was our first time.	Kienet l-ewwel darba tagħna.
That definitely helps.	Li żgur jgħin.
Whether we like it or not.	Irridu jew le.
Not too much just now.	Mhux wisq biss issa.
I didn’t know there was more	Ma kontx naf li kien hemm aktar
I didn't want to tell you that	Ma ridtx ngħidlek hekk
I said at the time	għidt dak iż-żmien
Maybe, everything I was eating.	Forsi, dak kollu li kont tiekol.
I don't need any help to do that.	M'għandi bżonn l-ebda għajnuna biex nagħmel dan.
I wasn't sure.	Ma kontx ċert.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwarha.
I wonder a lot about it	Nistaqsi ħafna dwarha
I have no idea about this problem.	M'għandi l-ebda idea dwar din il-problema.
More more more.	Aktar aktar aktar.
I didn’t want to believe it was happening	Ma ridtx nemmen li kien qed jiġri
I hope she was right	Jien nittama li kellha raġun
But he knows something.	Imma jaf xi ħaġa.
Really, you want this book.	Tassew, trid dan il-ktieb.
How do I do that.	Kif nista nagħmel dan.
As many times before.	Kif ħafna drabi qabel.
I hear how he comes and goes	Nisma kif hu jiġi u jmur
But really.	Imma tassew.
Now it wasn’t enough.	Issa ma kienx biżżejjed.
I often had a lot on	Ħafna drabi kelli ħafna fuq
I have a lot to say about	Għandi ħafna xi ngħid dwar
I expect this from anyone.	Nistenna dan ta’ ħadd.
I thought it would be difficult	Ħsibt żgur li se jkun diffiċli
There.	Hemmhekk.
And that's what he said.	U dan huwa dak li qal.
The things to do.	L-affarijiet li tagħmel.
Try it now.	Ipprova issa.
Maybe he had.	Forsi kellu.
I know it looked bad, but nothing happened	Naf li deher ħażin, imma ma ġara xejn
Everything is working fine.	Kollox qed jaħdem tajjeb.
I thought a lot for you too	Ħsibt ħafna għalik ukoll
We can do that.	Nistgħu nagħmlu hekk.
I was scared.	Kont nibża’.
I had to know how it was going.	Kelli nkun naf kif kien sejjer.
I just can't.	Ma nistax biss.
You know, it was really hard.	Taf, kien tassew diffiċli.
You must go now.	Trid tmur issa.
But nothing seems to be working.	Imma jidher li xejn qed jaħdem.
And of course he left us.	U ovvjament telaq magħna.
But not alone.	Imma mhux waħdi.
You never know when your last chance will be.	Qatt ma tkun taf meta se tkun l-aħħar ċans tiegħek.
I have to do well	Ikolli nagħmel tajjeb
And he.	U hu.
Surely he was right.	Żgur li kellu raġun.
Everyone is here.	Kulħadd qiegħed hawn.
I said it was good and everything was fine.	Għidt li kien tajjeb u kollox kien tajjeb.
I have never seen a man do this before	Qatt ma rajt raġel jagħmel dan qabel
I know there is someone out there for me	Naf li hemm xi ħadd hemmhekk għalija
I think you know very well what this is.	Naħseb li taf tajjeb ħafna x'inhu dan.
Right now, it was time.	Bħalissa, kien wasal iż-żmien.
You have to do it all.	Int trid tagħmel dan kollu.
I can't talk about it	Ma nistax nitkellem dwarha
I couldn’t wait any longer	Ma stajtx nistenna aktar
It never was.	Qatt ma kien.
They were.	Huma kienu .
I can’t believe everything that happened	Ma nistax nemmen dak kollu li ġara
You can't go back.	Inti ma tistax lura.
And we did it.	U għamilna dan.
It should be in the morning again.	Għandu jerġa’ jkun filgħodu.
I think he loved me	Naħseb li hu iħobb miegħi
I’ve never been right before.	Qatt ma kont raġun qabel.
I thought everyone knew.	Ħsibt li kulħadd kien jaf.
I want your help, and so can she	Nixtieq l-għajnuna tiegħek, u hekk tista 'hi
I heard you didn’t want me	Smajt li ma ridtx lili
I think everyone did	Naħseb li kulħadd għamel
It was the first time he had ever been home.	Kienet l-ewwel darba li qatt ġie d-dar.
To do this.	Biex tagħmel dan.
It was beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa.
He is not.	Hu mhux.
Let's do another one.	Ejja nagħmlu ieħor.
I want you to see this	Irrid li tara dan
He does so.	Jagħmel hekk.
That was all she needed.	Dan kien dak li kellha bżonn.
He’s like a big boy.	Huwa bħal tifel kbir.
This does not.	Dan ma.
He had fun too.	Huwa ħa gost ukoll.
It's just you and me tonight.	Huwa biss int u jien illejla.
I just wanted to be me	Jien biss ridt inkun jien
Everyone thinks this is it.	Kulħadd jaħseb li dan hu.
I didn’t want that.	Jien ma ridtx hekk.
First, that's for sure	L-ewwel, dak żgur
I have no idea what happened	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'ġara
I shouldn’t be worried about it, he said	M'għandix inkun inkwetat dwarha, qal
Always do what is right.	Dejjem tagħmel dak li hu tajjeb.
It does too.	Jagħmel ukoll.
I have nowhere else to go.	M'għandi fejn immur ieħor.
She's mine, mine, mine.	Hi tiegħi, tiegħi, tiegħi.
A young man, one of many.	Raġel żgħir, wieħed minn ħafna.
I'll see where I go with this.	Nara fejn sejjer b’dan.
And they do.	U jagħmlu.
She did nothing.	Hija ma għamlet xejn.
I have a little bit of that as well	Ikolli ftit minn dak ukoll
He seems to be an outsider.	Jidher li jkun persuna barra.
Almost everyone does.	Kważi kulħadd jagħmel.
You can't do this long enough.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan għal żmien biżżejjed.
I’m thinking about both	Qiegħed naħseb dwar it-tnejn
I think he really tried to be a good man	Naħseb li verament ipprova jkun raġel tajjeb
I can’t say why.	Ma nistax ngħid għaliex.
Not even a little.	Lanqas ftit.
So she did.	Hekk għamlet hi.
I saw the two together.	Rajt it-tnejn flimkien.
It was not so.	Ma kienx hekk.
It could be.	Huwa jista 'jkun.
I knew there was one, but not where	Kont naf li kien hemm wieħed, imma mhux fejn
what are you seeing ?.	x'qed tara?.
Everything is for you, and you are for me.	Kollox huwa għalik, u int għalija.
It's the same.	Huwa l-istess.
I didn't want that.	Ma ridtx hekk.
She should have known that.	Hija kellha tkun taf dan.
We want to do better.	Irridu nagħmlu aħjar.
He can be anything.	Huwa jista 'jkun dak kollu.
Sometimes he did.	Xi drabi hekk għamel.
He had thought that.	Huwa kien ħaseb li.
I did it myself.	Jien għamilt jien.
Until then I won’t talk to you much more about it.	Sa dak iż-żmien mhux se nitkellem miegħek ħafna aktar dwarha.
I just want someone to talk to	Irrid biss lil xi ħadd biex nitkellem
I needed to know what was going on and why.	Kelli bżonn inkun naf x’kien qed jiġri u għaliex.
Not now, not tonight.	Mhux issa, mhux illejla.
I hope you do well.	Nispera li jagħmel tajjeb.
I could never have expected something like this	Qatt ma stajt nistenna xi ħaġa bħal din
I didn’t know what to say to this	Ma kontx naf x'se ngħid għal dan
He’s great, but he doesn’t know any better.	Huwa kbir, imma ma jafx aħjar.
It's very big.	Huwa kbir ħafna.
Same thing with him.	L-istess ħaġa miegħu.
I wasn’t ready to be me	Ma kontx lest biex inkun jien
I wasn’t expecting this at all	Jien ma kont qed nistenna dan xejn
But there was no one, really.	Imma ma kien hemm ħadd, tassew.
I had heard about it	Kont smajt dwarha
But this was supposed to be a big deal.	Imma din suppost kellha tkun ħaġa kbira.
There was a very good friend of mine.	Kien hemm ħabib tajjeb ħafna tiegħi.
I had never done anything like that before	Qatt ma kont għamilt xi ħaġa bħal dik qabel
I think it was hard for him	Naħseb li kien diffiċli għalih
I won’t think about it	Mhux se naħseb dwar dan
It's just hard.	Huwa biss diffiċli.
A friend will never leave	Ħabib qatt mhu se jitlaq
Definitely in the morning.	Żgur filgħodu.
We might just be on to something here.	Aħna jista 'jkun biss fuq xi ħaġa hawn.
But it was so much.	Imma kien tant.
There is no.	M'hemm l-ebda.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Forsi ftit, forsi ħafna.
He may still be.	Huwa jista 'jkun għadu.
I can’t take this anymore	Ma nistax nieħu dan aktar
But not everyone went.	Imma mhux kulħadd mar.
I still haven't been able to do that	Għadni ma stajtx nagħmel dan
I see everything	Nara minn kollox
If he could do that, he could do something.	Kieku seta’ jagħmel dan, jista’ jagħmel xi ħaġa.
I already know what you're thinking	Diġà naf x'qed taħseb
That will happen.	Hekk se jiġri.
It was wrong.	Kien ħażin.
I was right to do that	Kelli raġun nagħmel dan
I will always be watching.	Jien dejjem inkun nara.
But he doesn't have to.	Imma m’għandux għalfejn jagħmel dan.
I don't know who he was	Ma nafx min kien
It was hard not to.	Kien diffiċli li ma tkunx.
I can't see who he is.	Ma nistax nara min hu.
But please know this.	Imma jekk jogħġbok taf dan.
I so want it to be ready	Jien hekk irrid li jkun lest
You need each other.	Għandek bżonn lil xulxin.
We have the following.	Għandna dan li ġej.
I go there all the time	Immur hemm il-ħin kollu
I was talking about it now.	Kont qed titkellem dwarha issa.
I was going to do that tomorrow	Jien kont nagħmel hekk għada
This may not be quite.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx pjuttost.
If we can.	Jekk nistgħu.
If you want to be.	Jekk trid tkun.
In fact, I was really tired	Fil-fatt kont tassew għajjien
I enjoy being with you	Nieħu gost inkun miegħek
I'm surprised you're here.	Jien sorpriż li int hawn.
But not me.	Imma mhux jien.
I actually like it better.	Fil-fatt inħobb dan aħjar.
I really believe so.	Verament nemmen.
He loves to do it again.	Iħobb jerġa’ jagħmel.
I loved everyone and everything.	Kont inħobb lil kulħadd u kollox.
I wonder what they are doing	Nistaqsi x'qed jagħmlu
And so it was here.	U hekk kien hawn.
Not so.	Ma jkunx hekk.
Being good is not good enough.	Li tkun tajjeb mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
I know who they are now	Naf min huma issa
It was better than that.	Kienet aħjar minn hekk.
And, it seems he can.	U, jidher li jista '.
Sorry for that.	Jiddispjaċini għal dan.
I couldn’t say or do anything.	Ma stajt ngħid jew nagħmel xejn.
I just need to do this	Għandi biss bżonn nagħmel dan
I really didn’t need to do that	Verament ma kellix bżonn nagħmel dan
Not as much as it should be.	Mhux kemm suppost.
No, not enough.	Le, mhux biżżejjed.
I couldn't be with him anymore	Ma stajtx inkun aktar miegħu
But he had.	Imma kellu.
I have a big problem with this	Għandi problema kbira b'dan
I’m not going to go over one.	Jien mhux se mmur fuq waħda.
And it looks like he was actually interested.	U qisu kien fil-fatt interessat.
You will do the same.	Inti se tagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
Everything is already working.	Kollox diġà jaħdem.
I had never seen one.	Jien qatt ma kont rajt waħda.
I expect to do the same thing here	Nistenna li nagħmel l-istess ħaġa hawn
I know you can.	Naf li tista’.
He knew he wasn't going to.	Kien jaf li ma kienx se.
It's just ours.	Huwa biss tagħna.
He didn't even know where he was coming from.	Ma kienx jaf minn fejn kien ġie dak lanqas.
Maybe it was too late.	Forsi kien tard wisq.
I wasn’t having that	Ma kontx qed ikolli hekk
They usually do this for only a few hours.	Normalment jagħmlu dan biss għal ftit sigħat.
I can see that it works for you	Nista' nara li jaħdem għalik
I was going to be much more than that	Kont se nkun ħafna aktar minn dan
Surely you know that.	Żgur li taf li.
I wasn’t worried about telling anyone	Ma kontx inkwetat li jgħid lil xi ħadd
Have a good time with this.	Ikolli żmien tajjeb ma' dan.
You are really alone	Int verament waħdek
You knew what you were getting.	Kont taf x'qed tieħu.
I was not happy about that	Jien ma kontx kuntent b'dan
That's not bad	Dak mhux ħażin
I think it’s a good idea.	Naħseb li hija idea tajba.
I will not do otherwise now	Jien mhux se nagħmel mod ieħor issa
He came back.	Ġie lura.
That someone was me.	Dak xi ħadd kont jien.
No one knows what to do.	Ħadd ma jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
It can be more than one.	Jista 'jkun aktar minn wieħed.
He knows, and he won't.	Dan jaf, u mhux se.
I wasn’t sure what to do or say	Ma kontx ċert x'se nagħmel jew ngħid
I think so it goes	Naħseb li hekk imur
It's easy to do that.	Hija faċli tagħmel dan.
But no money.	Imma l-ebda flus.
But maybe, now it will.	Imma forsi, issa se.
I’m a teacher, after all.	Jien għalliem, wara kollox.
It's just not good.	Huwa biss mhux tajjeb.
I didn’t have to know this	Jien ma kellix naf dan
I just won't.	Jien biss mhux se.
She knows a way.	Hija taf mod.
I was no longer alone	Ma kontx aktar waħdi
I definitely didn't want you to know that	Żgur li ma ridtx li tkun taf hekk
That would be the last.	Dik tkun l-aħħar.
We were just having fun.	Konna biss nieħu gost.
I wasn’t sure he would	Ma kontx ċert li kieku
I couldn't say for sure.	Ma stajtx ngħid żgur.
I was hoping for you	Kont nittama li inti
I will know for sure where you are	Inkun naf żgur fejn int
I had to see this coming	I kellha nara dan ġej
I don’t want to think about what it might be.	Ma rridx naħseb dwar dak li jista 'jkun.
Not afraid or anything.	Mhux jibża jew xejn.
He didn’t know how to stand.	Ma kienx jaf kif joqgħod.
He came out to win.	Ħareġ biex jirbaħ.
I just couldn’t hear it that way	Ma stajtx biss smajt hekk
It's better.	Hija aħjar.
It was great.	Kienet kbira.
But in fact it is not.	Imma fil-fatt mhuwiex.
It is often probably.	Huwa ta 'spiss probabbilment.
I would like to know.	Nixtieq inkun naf.
I really want to know.	Irrid verament inkun naf.
It doesn't have to.	M’għandux għalfejn.
I will make everything go away	Se nagħmel kollox jitlaq
Everyone knows each other.	Kulħadd jaf lil xulxin.
So he wanted to do.	Hekk ried jagħmel.
I was the one who did it	Jien kont li għamilt dan
That is for sure.	Dan huwa ċert.
The house is around.	Id-dar hija madwar.
But it won't.	Imma mhux se.
I will love this.	Jien ser inħobb dan.
You do it really well.	Inti tagħmel dan tassew tajjeb.
He had no money for it.	Ma kellux flus għal dan.
I want to see how it all looks	Irrid nara kif jidher kollu
Not from me.	Mhux minni.
Live for it.	Jgħix għal dan.
I hope to do the same for you	Nispera li tagħmel l-istess għalik
I hope to come home soon	Nispera li tiġi d-dar dalwaqt
You do it.	Inti tagħmel dan.
I thought it was there	Ħsibt li kien hemm
Something here was wrong.	Xi ħaġa hawn kienet ħażina.
That could never happen.	Hekk jista' qatt jiġri.
I can't have everything	Ma nistax ikolli kollox
No one is wrong.	Ħadd mhu ħażin.
She knew there was a need there.	Kienet taf li kien hemm bżonn hemmhekk.
You can do your job again.	Tista 'tagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħek mill-ġdid.
There are a few.	Hemm ftit.
But how are you alone.	Imma kif inti biss.
And he did very well	U dan għamel tajjeb ħafna
Not that much to say.	Mhux li hemm ħafna xi ngħid.
I know what he needs	Naf x’għandu bżonn
I'll be back someday	Se nagħmel lura xi darba
I had to wonder why it was so	Kelli nistaqsi għaliex kien hekk
I didn’t know how many people there were	Ma kontx naf kemm hemm nies
He thought he could do better.	Huwa ħaseb li jista 'jagħmel aħjar.
What goes, comes.	Dak li jmur, jiġi.
I really have no idea how long it will be	Tassew m'għandi l-ebda idea kemm se jkun twil
It's just not over.	Huwa biss mhux fuq.
I think he was a good man.	Naħseb li kien raġel tajjeb.
I’m also into something else	Jien ukoll xi ħaġa oħra
And here it is.	U hawn hu.
I want it to be	Nixtieq li tiġi
He was playing alone.	Kien qed jilgħab waħdu.
I had to see this coming.	I kellha nara dan ġej.
I will do that.	Jien se nagħmel dan.
But we really don't.	Imma aħna verament ma.
I thought you should be here.	Ħsibt li għandek tkun hawn.
I thought you were.	Ħsibt li int.
I was thinking a lot for both of us	Kont qed naħseb ħafna għalina t-tnejn
I can't do that.	Jien ma nistax nagħmel dan.
I have to ask someone how bad it was.	Ikolli nistaqsi lil xi ħadd dwar kemm kien ħażin.
Time to make some money.	Żmien biex tagħmel xi flus.
It's not an easy thing to do.	Mhix ħaġa faċli li tagħmel.
It was just a happy time we had together.	Kien biss żmien kuntent li kellna flimkien.
Not what was there, but what wasn’t.	Mhux dak li kien hemm, imma dak li ma kienx.
I could tell.	Seta’ kont naf.
Good for you too.	Tajjeb għalik ukoll.
This is how everyone looks.	Dan huwa kif kulħadd jidher.
I wish someone had told me that here	Nixtieq li xi ħadd qalli li hawn
Many years, in fact.	Ħafna snin, fil-fatt.
I wanted to talk more	Ridt nitkellem aktar
He was right.	Huwa kien raġun.
And when it comes, it comes.	U meta tiġi, tiġi.
But everyone is so busy.	Imma kulħadd huwa daqshekk okkupat.
It's been out there.	Ilu hemm barra.
I can't do this forever.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan għal dejjem.
I just know you can’t talk too much to me.	Naf biss li ma tistax titkellem wisq għalija.
This has always been better.	Dan kien dejjem aħjar.
A pretty year.	Sena pjuttost.
Maybe no one will ever.	Forsi ħadd qatt ma se.
I had no idea they were here	Ma kellix idea li kienu hawn
I didn’t think she was actually going to go	Ma kontx naħseb li fil-fatt kienet se tmur
By now something bad was happening.	Sa issa kien jiġri xi ħaġa ħażina.
For years now.	Għal snin issa.
I did something wrong	Għamilt xi ħaġa ħażina
I know it’s really bad.	Naf li huwa verament ħażin.
Not the only one.	Mhux l-uniku wieħed.
I have no more friends.	M'għandix aktar ħbieb.
Now I fear for him.	Issa nibża għalih.
Everyone knows everyone.	Kulħadd jaf lil kulħadd.
But good.	Imma tajjeb.
There is something.	Hemm xi ħaġa.
This is not easy to do.	Dan mhux faċli li tagħmel.
I could never expect anything more	Qatt ma stajt nistenna xejn aktar
I didn't know what to say to anyone	Ma kont naf x’se ngħid lil ħadd
But you're not telling anyone.	Imma int ma tgħid lil ħadd.
I knew everyone was right	Kont naf li kulħadd kellu raġun
There goes another.	Hemm imur ieħor.
It would be good too.	Ikun tajjeb ukoll.
It's just so there.	Huwa biss hekk hemmhekk.
This is not a quick one.	Din mhix waħda ta 'malajr.
Don't do that anymore.	M'għandekx aktar tagħmel dan.
Nothing is really what it seems to be.	Xejn huwa verament dak li jidher li hu.
Now it never would.	Issa qatt ma kieku.
Many, many, years.	Ħafna, ħafna, snin.
I have an idea for some fun around here	Għandi idea għal xi gost madwar hawn
You can go wherever you want.	Tista' tmur fejn tixtieq.
I’m not sure where I’m going to go from here.	M'inix ċert fejn se mmur minn hawn.
I just can't take it anymore	I biss ma nistax nieħu aktar
With a little help everything is going well.	Bi ftit għajnuna kollox sejjer tajjeb.
I know what's going on	Naf x’qed jiġri
Nothing like that has ever happened before.	Xejn bħal dak qatt ma ġara qabel.
But it does so much more.	Imma tagħmel ħafna aktar.
What is this ?.	X'inhu dan?.
It’s just too late.	Għadni biss tard wisq.
No, not so much.	Le, mhux hekk.
I think you do.	Naħseb li tagħmel.
I don’t know what’s wrong	Ma nafx x'inhu ħażin
I needed that job.	Jien kelli bżonn dak ix-xogħol.
They felt a little too good.	Ħassu ftit wisq tajjeb.
Someone else came	Daħal xi ħadd ieħor
I was just interested in doing it	Kont biss interessat li nagħmel dan
I was never sure why	Qatt ma kont ċert għaliex
I have no idea what just happened	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'ġara biss
It seems a bit much to everyone.	Jidher daqsxejn ħafna għal kulħadd.
Not one, many.	Mhux wieħed, ħafna.
You know, there are a lot of things.	Taf, hemm ħafna affarijiet.
I am a very beautiful person.	Jien persuna sabiħa ħafna.
I have nothing.	M'għandi xejn.
I’m surprised you don’t	Jien sorpriż li ma tagħmilx hekk
He will not come to you here.	Hu mhux se jasal għandek hawn.
He had gone in the morning.	Huwa kien mar filgħodu.
I needed to understand	Kelli bżonn nifhem
We can do better than that.	Nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar minn hekk.
I still do that now.	Għadni nagħmel hekk issa.
I will think about it	Se naħseb dwarha
At the time it didn’t look bad.	Dak iż-żmien ma deherx ħażin.
My dog ​​has always been home.	Il-kelb tiegħi dejjem ġie d-dar.
I have to think it’s unlikely	Għandi naħseb li mhux probabbli
The same thing happened to me.	L-istess ġara lili.
I can’t go back there.	Ma nistax immur lura hemm.
I didn’t have to go home	Ma kellix għalfejn immur id-dar
I thought it was great there	Ħsibt li kien kbir hemmhekk
There was no time.	Ma kienx hemm ħin.
I have to say something	Ikolli ngħid xi ħaġa
That's me.	Dak jien.
Don’t do that, you know.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan, taf.
I couldn’t understand why he would	Ma stajtx nifhem għaliex kieku
I think it’s a great idea.	Naħseb li hija idea kbira.
That will come soon.	Dak jiġi dalwaqt.
I don’t expect anything more.	Ma nistenna xejn aktar.
It may be out for a while	Jista 'jkun barra għal xi żmien
It was easier than that.	Kien aktar faċli minn hekk.
He was still not quite right, of course.	Huwa kien għadu ma tantx raġun, ovvjament.
I was glad I was there	Kont ferħan li kont hemm
I definitely never had a friend at home	Żgur qatt ma kelli ħabib fuq id-dar
I had never been here.	Qatt ma kelli ġejt hawn.
Everything will be fine	Kollox se jkun tajjeb
They never do anything.	Huma qatt ma jagħmlu xejn.
He had to speak.	Kellu jitkellem.
I go too.	Jien ukoll immur.
And there was hardly anyone.	U ma tantx kien hemm ħadd.
He does, and how.	Huwa jagħmel, u kif.
I can never wait.	Qatt nista' nistenna.
We had there.	Kellna hemm.
It must be before.	Għandu jkun qabel.
I really, really, I	Jien tassew, tassew, jien
There is nothing wrong with knowing this.	M'hemm xejn ħażin li tkun taf dan.
I only see a man.	Nara raġel biss.
I thought maybe there were things she needed to say.	Ħsibt li forsi kien hemm affarijiet li kellha bżonn tgħid.
Nothing they do seems right.	Xejn li jagħmlu jidher li hu tajjeb.
I need something big	Għandi bżonn xi ħaġa kbira
I wanted to know what he was really thinking.	Ridt inkun naf x’kien qed jaħseb tassew.
Everyone is out there.	Kulħadd hemm barra.
I knew this would probably take some time	Kont naf li dan probabbilment jieħu ftit żmien
It may be later today.	Jista 'jkun aktar tard illum.
And this is a bad thing.	U din hija ħaġa ħażina.
I always believe that tomorrow will be better.	Jien dejjem nemmen li għada se jkun aħjar.
And she knew it.	U kienet taf.
You must do this for me.	Int trid tagħmel dan għalija.
It’s just not good enough.	Huwa biss mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
Okay, all right.	Tajjeb, kollox tajjeb.
I have nothing to say.	M'għandix xi ngħid.
Or maybe he had gone back to a time before it started.	Jew forsi kien mar lura għal żmien qabel ma beda.
It really helps to know that this is coming.	Huwa tassew jgħin li tkun taf li dan ġej.
I'm the truth.	Jien il-verità.
I never had to do that	Qatt ma kelli nagħmel hekk
But you can too.	Imma inti tista 'ukoll.
I should have known for sure	Kelli nkun naf żgur
I wanted to try the last thing	Ridt nipprova l-aħħar ħaġa
I just thought maybe you want to know.	Ħsibt biss li forsi trid tkun taf.
He did a good job as well.	Għamel xogħol tajjeb ukoll.
There is much more here.	Hemm ħafna aktar hawn.
But no, really.	Imma mhux, tassew.
It was a very happy time.	Kien żmien ferħan ħafna.
I think a lot for you	Jien naħseb ħafna għalik
This was not happening.	Dan ma kienx qed jiġri.
Maybe it was good.	Forsi kien tajjeb.
I need help around the house.	Għandi bżonn għajnuna madwar id-dar.
I’m a man as big as you know	Jien raġel daqs kull ma taf
I really need to talk to you	Għandi verament bżonn nitkellem miegħek
I think they are both right	Naħseb li t-tnejn għandhom raġun
I'm thinking about it	Qiegħed naħseb dwarha
What was done was done.	Dak li sar sar.
I was supposed to do a good job the first time	I suppost għamilt ix-xogħol tajjeb l-ewwel darba
It seems harder.	Jidher aktar diffiċli.
I saw this when I was little	Dan rajt meta kont żgħir
Much more than you know.	Ħafna aktar milli taf.
He doesn't know how long to wait.	Ma jafx kemm jista’ jistenna.
I wasn’t ready to do that	Jien ma kontx lest li nagħmel dan
That’s good for me.	Dak tajjeb miegħi.
I was going to say so myself.	Jien kont se ngħid hekk jien.
Had she done so, she would have done so.	Kieku għamlet dan, kieku għamlet hekk.
There they were.	Hemm kienu.
I knew it was wrong	Kont naf li kien ħażin
Not surprised how good she is.	Mhux sorpriż kemm hi tajba.
Nor should he have.	Lanqas ma għandu jkollu.
I want this to be the last time I do this	Irrid li din tkun l-aħħar darba li nagħmel dan
There are many things to do.	Hemm ħafna affarijiet li jagħmlu dan.
And it helps.	U dan jgħin.
She is not here.	Hija mhix hawn.
But we don't.	Imma aħna ma.
That no one is likely to buy.	Li ħadd x'aktarx li jixtri.
I thought I wanted this.	Ħsibt li ridt dan.
I knew what he was going to say	Kont naf x’se jgħid
I have never thought about this before.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan qabel.
He looked very tired.	Deher għajjien ħafna.
Come on now, it’s time to go.	Ejja issa, wasal iż-żmien li tmur.
It was early in the morning.	Kien kmieni filgħodu.
There is no going back.	M'hemm l-ebda tmur lura.
I didn’t think this was going to happen	Ma kontx ħsibt li dan se jiġri
I'm out now.	Jien barra issa.
I will do what you want	Jien se nagħmel li trid
I can’t wait for this.	Ma nistax nistenna dan.
He said he will not come back.	Qal li mhux se jiġi lura.
If there are any.	Jekk hemm xi.
I don’t even think about it.	Lanqas naħseb dwarha.
Not so.	Mhux hekk hu.
She had nothing.	Ma kellha xejn.
I better try something else	Aħjar nipprova xi ħaġa oħra
I couldn’t think anymore.	Ma stajtx naħseb aktar.
It should only happen once.	Għandu jiġri darba biss.
You can't be wrong.	Int ħadd ma jista’ ħażin.
That’s for us.	Dak hu għalina.
I don’t know where it comes from.	Ma nafx minn fejn ġej.
You are eating a little.	Qed tiekol ftit.
I like to talk a lot about everything	Inħobb nitkellem ħafna dwar kollox
It's a bit of.	Hija daqsxejn ta.
He had to think about it.	Huwa kellu jaħseb dwar dan.
I was not able to do that	Ma kontx kapaċi nagħmel dan
I knew it was going to be something big.	Kont naf li se tkun xi ħaġa kbira.
I wish she was still with me now	Nixtieq li kienet għadha miegħi issa
Nobody said, ever.	Qal ħadd, qatt.
I had come home years ago	Kelli ġejt id-dar snin ilu
She's not here.	Hi mhix ta’ hawn.
I wasn’t surprised.	Ma kontx kont sorpriż.
That is for sure.	Dan huwa ċert.
You don’t have to go any further.	M'għandekx għalfejn tmur aktar.
I could tell he wasn’t ready	Jien stajt ngħid li ma kienx lest
But try it.	Imma ipprova.
I think he wants to have both.	Naħseb li jrid ikollu t-tnejn.
And a good thing she did.	U ħaġa tajba hi ma.
I went to the door and no one was there	Mort lejn il-bieb u ħadd ma kien hemm
In fact, she was thinking of doing it.	Fil-fatt, kienet qed taħseb biex tagħmel dan.
For many years.	Għal ħafna snin.
I think that’s what it is	Naħseb li huwa dak li hu
Don't say anything.	Ma tgħid xejn.
This is about where it should be.	Dan huwa dwar fejn għandu jkun.
It may work for you.	Jista 'jaħdem għalik.
I believe what you say	Nemmen dak li tgħid
We have made things very easy for you.	Għamilna l-affarijiet faċli ħafna għalik.
I didn’t want to.	Ma ridtx.
I'm just trying to see.	Qed nipprova nara biss.
That was good enough.	Dak kien tajjeb biżżejjed.
I do so I hope it comes.	Nagħmel hekk nittama li jiġi.
That never happens again.	Li qatt ma jiġri aktar.
And so it does.	U hekk jagħmel.
I couldn't go any further	Ma stajtx immur aktar
I go to the door	Immur fuq il-bieb
I was home alone and alone	Kont id-dar waħdi u waħdi
It was going wrong.	Kien sejjer ħażin.
I think not sure, either	Naħseb li mhux ċert, lanqas
It never looked more beautiful.	Qatt ma kienet tidher aktar sabiħa.
But what has been done is done.	Imma dak li sar isir.
Probably too good.	Probabbilment tajjeb wisq.
Or before it was.	Jew qabel kien.
It was very helpful again.	Kien ta’ għajnuna kbira mill-ġdid.
Just like this.	Eżatt bħal dan.
Along with.	Flimkien ma.
I have no idea how it got here	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif wasal hawn
You want to talk to him.	Trid titkellem miegħu.
I would say	Nixtieq ngħid
I can’t believe he was going to do that	Ma nistax nemmen li kien se jagħmel hekk
I was just thinking	Kont qed naħseb biss
Nothing else can do that.	Xejn aktar ma jista 'jagħmel dan.
I think there was no time	Naħseb li ma kienx hemm ħin
There was no one there.	Ma kien hemm ħadd hemm.
I am so glad to be home.	Jien ferħan ħafna li nkun id-dar.
He must stay with us.	Għandu jibqa’ magħna.
I know it's not easy being here	Naf li mhux faċli li tkun hawn
He comes back around for you.	Huwa ġej lura madwar għalik.
No one had seen him yet.	Ħadd ma kien għadu ra.
I was there, you know	Jien kont hemm, taf
But they are right.	Imma għandhom raġun.
There is more.	Hemm aktar.
Look at this house.	Ħares lejn din id-dar.
You're right, we did it.	Għandek raġun, għamilna dan.
I could never do that	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel hekk
Glad to do that.	Kuntent li tagħmel dan.
I have one.	Jien għandi wieħed.
I have it ready.	Għandi lest.
I’ve been thinking about this for a while	Ilni naħseb dwar dan għal xi żmien
I was glad she did	Kont ferħan li għamlet dan
I think he will leave	Naħseb li se jitlaq
Great! 	Kbir!
you think.	int taħseb.
I think it might help	Naħseb li jista 'jgħin
I didn’t think it was a good idea	Ma kontx naħseb li kienet idea tajba
I really don’t know why.	Verament ma nafx għaliex.
He agreed that it is a good idea.	Huwa qabel li hija idea tajba.
I need you to come here	Għandi bżonn li tiġi hawn
I don’t think why that happens.	Ma naħsibx għaliex jiġri hekk.
I need to know that you are staying with me.	Għandi bżonn inkun naf li inti toqgħod miegħi.
She played more than many.	Hija kellha aktar minn ħafna.
I'm not sure.	M'inix ċert.
And so it was.	U hekk kien.
I think we can do more and better.	Naħseb li nistgħu nagħmlu aktar u aħjar.
Someone had.	Xi ħadd kellu.
You know nothing about it.	Inti ma taf dwar xejn.
I never knew enough.	Qatt ma kont naf biżżejjed.
And that’s a problem for me.	U dik għalija hija problema.
There is nothing you can say.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tgħid.
This is not going to happen now.	Dan mhux se jiġri issa.
But she won't.	Imma hi mhux se.
I think it will.	Naħseb li se.
This does not seem to work.	Dan ma jidhirx li jaħdem.
I didn’t want any of that	Jien ma ridt xejn minn dan
I just don’t want anything from mine.	Jien biss ma rrid xejn minn tiegħi.
But there was something else first.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra l-ewwel.
I understand why this is	Nifhem għaliex dan hu
I think this book helps	Naħseb li dan il-ktieb jgħin
I can't speak right now.	Ma nistax nitkellem bħalissa.
I wasn't sure, but it looked like he was leaving	Ma kontx ċert, imma qisu kien se jitlaq
Well, that's what he wanted.	Ukoll, hekk ried.
I knew who could and couldn't	Kont naf min seta’ u min ma jistax
I don’t think anyone knew what was going to happen.	Ma naħsibx li ħadd ma kien jaf x'kien se jiġri.
I didn't say anything	Jien ma għedt xejn
Everyone sees me.	Kulħadd jara lili.
I want to be there	Irrid li tkun hemm
You are this.	Inti dan.
I thought about what he had done to me	Ħsibt dwar dak li kien għamel miegħi
I just took it, that's all	I biss ħa, huwa kollox
Had she had some.	Kieku kellha xi.
I hope this helps someone.	Nispera li dan jgħin lil xi ħadd.
I know you do.	Naf li inti tagħmel.
You've my account.	Inti stajt kont tiegħi.
He seemed to do nothing	Huwa deher li ma jagħmel xejn
Don’t say anything to anyone.	Ma tgħid xejn lil ħadd.
Much more.	Ħafna aktar.
I am sure you will do the same for me	Jiena ċert li inti tagħmel l-istess għalija
But nothing is working for me.	Imma xejn mhu qed jaħdem għalija.
Not nearly finished.	Mhux kważi lest.
I can’t think about it.	Ma nistax naħseb dwarha.
We are both tired.	Aħna t-tnejn għajjien.
But that time had not come.	Imma dak iż-żmien ma kienx wasal.
I had no idea this was happening	Ma kellix idea li dan ġara
I wanted to go back to him	Ridt immur lura għandu
I was having a lot of fun.	Kont qed nieħu gost ħafna.
You weren't happy.	Inti ma kontx kuntent.
Not now, but then, it was.	Mhux issa, imma dak iż-żmien, kien.
It is busy.	Jiġi okkupat.
But you’re not taking it yet.	Imma għadek mhux qed tieħu.
Maybe a lot.	Forsi ħafna.
We want you to be happy.	Irridu li inti tkun kuntent.
I just wanted to talk to him	Ridt biss nitkellem miegħu
I hope he will be willing to stay with me	Jien nittama li jkun lest li joqgħod miegħi
How can you go wrong?	Kif tista' tmur ħażin?.
Anyone can do that.	Kulħadd jista 'jagħmel dan.
It's not bad.	Huwa mhux ħażin.
That's all.	Dak hu biss.
I didn’t even know it really	Ma kontx naf lanqas verament
You can do one or the other.	Tista' tagħmel waħda jew oħra.
She had no time to think.	Ma kellha l-ebda ħin biex taħseb.
I have an idea where you can be	Għandi idea fejn tista' tkun
He knew he had nowhere to go.	Kien jaf li ma kellux fejn imur.
I know yours, and you know mine	Jiena naf tiegħek, u int taf tiegħi
And you are me.	U int jien.
So it was with us.	Hekk kien magħna.
But to no one else.	Imma lil ħadd ieħor.
I think she must have been out	Naħseb li hi trid kienet barra
In fact, I haven't done any work yet	Fil-fatt għadni ma għamilt l-ebda xogħol
She was beautiful with someone.	Kienet sabiħa ma’ xi ħadd.
I just wanted to know	Ridt inkun naf biss
The same thing we need.	L-istess ħaġa li għandna bżonn.
It was about three o'clock.	Kienu madwar tliet sigħat.
I had to say something	I kellha għid xi ħaġa
I think she is a good person	Naħseb li hi persuna tajba
But a lot.	Imma ħafna.
No one came.	Ħadd ma ġie.
I was thinking a lot about it.	Jien kont qed naħseb ħafna dwar dan.
I don't know now.	Ma nafx issa.
I am trying to understand this	Qed nipprova nifhem dan
Later she.	Aktar tard hi.
You can do a few things.	Tista 'tagħmel ftit affarijiet.
It seems to be ready.	Jidher li huwa lest.
And here we are.	U hawn aħna.
I made time for everything	Għamilt ħin għal kollox
I had no idea where she was	Ma kellix idea fejn kienet
This is not just.	Dan ma jkunx biss.
I still couldn’t tell.	Għadni ma stajtx ngħid.
I know what he wants to do	Naf xi jrid jagħmel
I wanted everyone to know she was mine	Ridt li kulħadd ikun jaf li hi tiegħi
I have to do.	Għandi nagħmel.
I can't stand it.	Jien ma nistax noqgħod.
It’s my first, after all.	Huwa l-ewwel tiegħi, wara kollox.
No one took it.	Ħadd ma ħa.
I hope to go there again	Nispera li nerġa' mmur hemm
It was something no one had seen before.	Kienet xi ħaġa li ħadd ma kien ra qabel.
He wasted no time.	Huwa tilef il-ħin.
And he’s probably right.	U probabbilment għandu raġun.
After that nothing happens.	Wara dan ma jiġri xejn.
More and more than ever.	Aktar u aktar minn qatt qabel.
You have no idea how to do everything.	M'għandekx idea kif tagħmel kollox.
I was almost alone there	Jien kont kważi waħdi hemmhekk
He did his job.	Għamel ix-xogħol tiegħu.
I have no idea how much	M'għandi l-ebda idea kemm hi
Nothing there.	Xejn m'hemm.
I love where I’m going	Jien inħobb fejn sejjer
I actually wanted to go	Fil-fatt ridt immur
I can't understand how he does that	Ma nistax nifhem kif jagħmel dan
I couldn’t believe it when he told me	Ma stajtx nemmen meta qalli
Now I’ve understood the problem.	Issa stajt nifhem il-problema.
Something is wrong.	Xi ħaġa tmur ħażin.
It came from outside.	Ġie minn barra.
This happens here.	Dan jiġri hawn.
He says he's not sure.	Jgħid li mhux ċert.
I’m one of many	Jien wieħed minn ħafna
All I knew was that she was telling everyone	Kont naf biss li kienet qed tgħid lil kulħadd
I have something for you.	Għandi xi ħaġa għalik.
Well, now you can.	Ukoll, issa tista '.
I wasn’t even thinking about it	Lanqas kont qed naħseb dwarha
I didn’t want that.	Jien ma ridtx hekk.
I can’t believe this happened	Ma nistax nemmen li ġara dan
He never arrives.	Hu qatt ma jasal.
I went there later	Mort hemm aktar tard
We just want him to be a kid and play.	Irridu biss li jkun tifel u jilgħab.
I didn’t know it at the time	Dak iż-żmien ma kontx naf
I can't understand.	Jien ma nistax nifhem.
I really wasn't so interested at the time	Verament ma kontx daqshekk interessat dak iż-żmien
I was thinking I think.	Kont qed naħseb naħseb.
I think she’s probably not the only one.	Naħseb li hi probabbilment mhux l-unika waħda.
I still had to understand this	Għadni kelli nifhem dan
I'll try again later.	Ser nerġa' nipprova aktar tard.
You stand above.	Inti toqgħod hawn fuq.
Very helpful and easy.	Ta’ għajnuna u faċli ħafna.
But we don’t have a few years.	Imma m'għandniex ftit snin.
Work.	Xogħol.
But you were small.	Imma int kont żgħir.
I was having the same problem.	Kont qed ikolli l-istess problema.
This is who they are.	Dan hu min huma.
This is easy to see as follows.	Dan huwa faċli biex tara kif ġej.
He didn’t want to think about it.	Ma riedx jaħseb dwarha.
It was really good.	Kienet tassew tajba.
It was still difficult.	Kien għadu diffiċli.
I wanted to be alone and think	Ridt inkun waħdi u naħseb
They are every year.	Huma kull sena.
Either that or.	Jew dik jew.
I will definitely regret it tomorrow.	Żgur li għada se jiddispjaċini minn dan.
So he said.	Hekk qal.
You can't say that.	Ma tistax tgħid hekk.
Not very visible.	Ma tantx tidher.
That’s not really the problem.	Dik mhix verament il-problema.
It’s hard to say, no one knows for sure.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid, ħadd ma jaf żgur.
I will do so.	Immur nagħmel hekk.
It was really beautiful.	Kienet tassew sabiħa.
It was the dog.	Kien il-kelb.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
I have so.	Ikolli hekk.
I thought about it long after	Ħsibt dwarha ħafna wara
That's working well.	Dak qed jaħdem tajjeb.
I hope they are really good	Nispera li huma verament tajjeb
That’s what he really loves.	Dak hu li verament iħobb.
As I said.	Kif għedt.
I think it was the same for him	Naħseb li kien l-istess għalih
I didn't know you looked like that	Ma kontx naf li int tidher hekk
What he did was great.	Dak li għamel kien kbir.
It was a long time ago.	Kien żmien twil ilu.
I did it without thinking	Għamilt mingħajr ma ħsibt
More than you ever know.	Aktar milli qatt tkun taf.
He just didn’t want to think about it right now.	Huwa biss ma riedx jaħseb dwarha bħalissa.
I couldn't be happier he thought	Ma stajtx inkun ferħan hu ħaseb
But it still wasn’t.	Imma għadu ma kienx għadu.
I wasn't just going to talk to anyone	Jien ma kontx se nitkellem ma' ħadd biss
But that was of little help.	Imma dik kienet ftit għajnuna.
I have nothing to say	M'għandi xejn xi ngħid
I know for sure	Naf li żgur
That this was all for naught.	Li dan kien kollu għal xejn.
But not everyone.	Imma mhux kulħadd.
No one will see this.	Ħadd mhu se jara dan.
I can believe everything I said	Nista’ nemmen dak kollu li għidt
Well, I'm trying to have some fun.	Ukoll, qed nipprova nieħu xi gost.
You know it would.	Inti taf li kieku.
This is completely wrong.	Dan huwa għal kollox ħażin.
I can't go back home	Ma nistax immur lura d-dar
Later, or not as it happens.	Aktar tard, jew le kif jiġri.
I was his.	Jien kont tiegħu.
So much so that you are alone.	Tant li tkun waħdu.
After all he was right.	Wara kollox kellu raġun.
He didn't.	Huwa ma.
When, why and how to do it.	Meta, għaliex u kif tagħmel dan.
I have never seen this happen before	Qatt ma rajt dan jiġri qabel
Which is what we have now.	Li huwa dak li għandna issa.
I wish it could be me, though	Nixtieq li jista 'jkun jien, imma
Look at this beautiful house.	Ħares lejn din id-dar sabiħa.
I wanted something more	Ridt xi ħaġa aktar
It's not really there.	Huwa mhux verament hemm.
He is happy now.	Huwa kuntent issa.
He could not be a man.	Ma setax ikun raġel.
I still do mine	Għadni nagħmel tiegħi
I'm so scared.	Jien tant nibża.
I need to know this	Għandi bżonn li tkun taf dan
I just need more time, a little more time	Għandi bżonn biss aktar ħin, ftit aktar ħin
Ready for it.	Lest għal dan.
Everyone takes that.	Kulħadd jieħu dak.
I'm so glad you're back	Jien ferħan ħafna li int lura
He didn’t ask much about it	Ma tantx staqsa dwar dan
In fact, this is often the case.	Fil-fatt, ħafna drabi mhux hekk jiġri.
This is still happening.	Dan għadu qed jiġri.
I need the truth first	L-ewwel għandi bżonn il-verità
Really a lot to do about anything.	Tassew ħafna tagħmel dwar xejn.
This takes time.	Dan jeħtieġ iż-żmien.
I know it will come around	Naf li se tiġi madwar
I think it was on to something	Naħseb li kienet fuq xi ħaġa
I never did.	Jien qatt ma.
No, nobody.	Le, ħadd.
It happened so fast.	Ġara daqshekk malajr.
There are things you can do.	Hemm affarijiet li tista 'tagħmel.
He looked like a big boy.	Kien qisu tifel kbir.
Well, there is the first.	Ukoll, hemm l-ewwel.
Not for this one.	Mhux għal dan wieħed.
No one did anything.	Ħadd ma għamel xejn.
Everyone knows so much.	Kulħadd jaf daqshekk.
Look at what it will do.	Ħares lejn dak li se tagħmel.
I can't do this for you	Ma nistax nagħmel dan għalik
It's not there now.	Mhuwiex hemm issa.
He was very surprised.	Kien sorpriż ħafna.
I just want to be your friend	Irrid inkun ħabib tiegħek biss
It's only been a while.	Huwa biss għal xi żmien.
This is much better.	Din hija ħafna aħjar.
It’s too early.	Għadu kmieni wisq.
No one is going back.	Ħadd mhu qed imur lura.
It was a little of everything.	Kien ftit minn kollox.
Well, almost everything.	Ukoll, kważi kollox.
I'm not really sure	M'inix ċert tassew
From person to person.	Minn persuna għal oħra.
I didn’t tell anyone this	Jien ma għedt lil ħadd dan
It looked really great.	Deher tassew kbir.
No one will come.	Ħadd mhu se jiġi.
I wanted to go back to how things were	Ridt immur lura għal kif kienu l-affarijiet
You are not a small child anymore.	M'intix tifel żgħir aktar.
I can see why you think so.	Nista’ nara għaliex taħseb hekk.
No one knows.	Ħadd ma jkun jaf.
But only just.	Imma biss biss.
I thought it should be.	Ħsibt li għandu jkun.
Whatever please.	Tkun xi tkun jekk jogħġbok.
I couldn’t do it alone	Jien ma stajtx nagħmel dan waħdi
Not now.	Mhux issa.
I find this difficult for you	Nara li dan huwa diffiċli għalik
All the time.	Il-ħin kollu.
She knows how to eat.	Hija tkun taf kif tiekol.
I didn't want to know what was going on	Ma ridtx inkun naf x’qed jiġri
I’m sorry but that’s the way things are	Jiddispjaċini imma hekk hu l-affarijiet
I would be fine now	Inkun tajjeb issa
I can do this for you	Nista' nagħmel dan għalik
It’s just hard for us.	Huwa biss diffiċli għalina.
It was very good.	Kienet tajba ħafna.
I’m not trying to do anything	Jien mhux qed nipprova nagħmel xejn
In three years, it’s all yours.	Fi tliet snin, huwa kollu tiegħek.
Nothing has ever been the same.	Xejn qatt ma kien l-istess.
But you have to do things.	Imma trid tagħmel l-affarijiet.
I wanted more.	Ridt aktar.
What happened.	X'ġara.
I was already in love with him	Diġà kont inħobb miegħu
I can’t believe she did that.	Ma nistax nemmen li għamlet dan.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
I am very sorry for him.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għalih.
You think it’s going well.	Taħseb li sejjer tajjeb.
And you have to.	U għandek.
And be sure.	U tkun ċert.
Because we are.	Għaliex aħna.
I wonder why it is so.	Nistaqsi għaliex hu hekk.
I'm not afraid	M'għandix nibża'
I had to see that one coming	I kellha nara li wieħed ġej
I didn’t want to know any more	Ma ridtx inkun naf aktar
It's a lot of fun.	Huwa gost ħafna.
I'm worried you won't	Jien inkwetat li inti ma tkunx
And not much.	U mhux ħafna.
I can try again	Nista' nerġa' nipprova
No, it was both.	Le, kien it-tnejn.
I don’t know anyone here	Jien ma naf lil ħadd hawn
It looks like nothing.	Qisu xejn.
I had no idea where he was	Ma kellix idea fejn kien
I just want it to be sooner rather than later	Nixtieq biss li jkun aktar kmieni milli tard
I can’t believe it all	Ma nistax nemmen dan kollu
I wanted to go back to that	Jien ridt immur lura għal dak
He said no to many.	Qal le għal ħafna.
That was a long time ago.	Dak kien żmien twil ilu.
I knew who you were, you know	Kont naf min int, taf
Not so great.	Mhux daqshekk kbir.
You know I did.	Taf li għamilt.
I have no idea what's going on with this	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'hemm ma' dan
He had little money.	Ma tantx kellu flus.
But it is happening.	Imma hekk qed jiġri.
What is this.	X'inhu dan.
I know nothing.	Jien ma naf xejn.
I never thought so.	Qatt ma kont ħsibt hekk.
I think everything works fine	Naħseb li kollox jaħdem tajjeb
I knew where he was coming from	Kont naf minn fejn kien ġej
There was no one else, and no money.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor, u l-ebda flus.
And now it is.	U issa huwa.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
I have a lot of friends out there.	Għandi ħafna ħbieb hemmhekk.
I enjoy both but here’s someone saying	Jien nieħu gost it-tnejn imma hawn xi ħadd kien qed jgħid
This is not what happened here.	Dan mhux dak li ġara hawn.
I didn’t know that.	Ma kontx naf dan.
There was nothing.	Ma kien hemm xejn.
But there was not enough.	Imma ma kienx hemm biżżejjed.
Not for that.	Mhux għal dan.
We are one thing.	Aħna ħaġa waħda.
That was pretty easy to do around here.	Li kien pjuttost faċli li tagħmel madwar hawn.
This will not be easy.	Dan mhux se jkun faċli.
It could have been.	Seta’ kien.
But he will, he will.	Imma hu se, hu se.
I hope everything goes well for you	Nispera li kollox imur tajjeb għalik
He could do whatever he wanted.	Seta’ għamel dak kollu li ried.
Now it was coming.	Issa kien ġej.
I’m afraid this is more time to know	Nibża li dan huwa aktar żmien biex tkun taf
Good to see.	Tajjeb li wieħed jara.
Ma hi.	Ma hi.
He was currently tired.	Bħalissa kien għajjien.
It should not do so.	M'għandux jagħmel hekk.
And other things.	U affarijiet oħra.
To do so.	Biex tagħmel hekk.
Something more me.	Xi ħaġa aktar jien.
I will do it now.	Jien se nagħmel issa.
So does everyone.	Hekk jagħmel kulħadd.
I really need to know everything now	Għandi verament bżonn inkun naf kollox issa
I'm really sorry about that	Jien tassew jiddispjaċini għal dan
I am here for you when ready.	Jiena hawn għalik meta lest.
No one should do it all alone.	Ħadd ma għandu jagħmel dan kollu waħdu.
This already now.	Dan diġà issa.
This may work.	Dan jista 'jaħdem.
It couldn’t be, but it is.	Ma setax ikun, imma huwa.
A man too good to do so.	Raġel wisq tajjeb biex jagħmel hekk.
I believe it will be there for a long time	Nemmen li se jkun hemm għal żmien twil
I hope you see.	Nispera li tara.
And so it is.	U hekk hu.
I’ve never been able to get anything back from that	Qatt ma stajt ikolli xi ħaġa minn dak lura
He was doing well in everything he did.	Kien jagħmel tajjeb dak kollu li għamel.
I'm a little scared to go.	Jien nibża’ ftit li mmur.
I didn’t want to come with me	Ma ridtx jiġi miegħi
I believe everything will work out	Nemmen li kollox se jaħdem
As possible.	Kif jista’ jkun.
I may think about this later	I tista 'taħseb dwar dan aktar tard
That really helps.	Li verament jgħin.
I was going to tell you so	Kont se ngħidlek hekk
I don't think you can.	Ma naħsibx li tista’.
I will not do that	Jien mhux se nagħmel hekk
I wish she was here with me now	Nixtieq li kienet hawn miegħi issa
I wanted to make everyone happy	Ridt nagħmel lil kulħadd kuntent
I knew it wasn’t forever	Kont naf li ma kienx għal dejjem ilu
But there is nothing like that out there.	Imma m'hemm xejn bħal dak hemmhekk.
It’s just the same as us.	Huwa biss l-istess kif aħna.
I needed to do everything right again	Kelli bżonn nagħmel kollox tajjeb mill-ġdid
After all not great.	Wara le kbira.
I hope someone can help.	Nittama li xi ħadd jista 'jgħin.
I really wasn't surprised at all	Verament ma kont sorpriż xejn
Nothing was wrong.	Xejn ma kien ħażin.
I never saw it.	Qatt ma rajt.
I know it’s not just me.	Naf li mhux jien biss.
I don’t think it’s likely.	Ma naħsibx li huwa probabbli.
It's nothing.	Mhu xejn.
For a long time no one could speak.	Għal żmien twil ħadd ma seta’ jitkellem.
He is a great man.	Huwa raġel kbir.
He may need your help.	Jista 'jkollu bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
I am so glad to be here	Jien ferħan ħafna li nkun hawn
And he was gone.	U kien telaq.
This still needs work, of course.	Dan għadu jeħtieġ xogħol, ovvjament.
I didn’t even know I was here	Lanqas kont naf li kont hawn
I must have done something right	I għandu għamilt xi ħaġa tajba
I was so sure.	Kont tant ċert.
This is about as bad as it gets.	Dan huwa madwar ħażin kemm jista 'jkun.
I can’t think about all this right now	Ma nistax naħseb dwar dan kollu bħalissa
Everything will work fine.	Kollox se jaħdem tajjeb.
Everything should just work.	Kollox għandu jaħdem biss.
It was about that.	Kien dwar dan.
I already know, pretty much, what’s going on	Diġà naf, pjuttost, x'inhu jiġri
I really know that	Jien verament naf li
They were people.	Kienu nies.
It wasn’t work, really.	Ma kienx xogħol, tassew.
She had to see that one coming.	Hija kellha tara li wieħed ġej.
I want to be happy again	Irrid li jerġa’ jkun kuntent
It may be, it may not be.	Jista 'jkun, jista' ma jkunx.
I would like to talk to you.	Nixtieq nitkellem miegħek.
I just thought I’d ask	Ħsibt biss li nistaqsi
But so it happened.	Imma hekk ġara.
By the time he got there, it was too late.	Sakemm wasal hemm, kien tard wisq.
I will take every chance it comes	Se nieħu kull ċans jiġi
No one should.	Ħadd ma għandu.
We have to do this first.	Irridu nagħmlu dan l-ewwel.
But this was not to be.	Imma dan ma kellux ikun.
I really need to know	Jien tassew ta’ min inkun naf
I'm sure you'll do well.	Jien ċert li inti ser tagħmel tajjeb.
Tell everyone she's good.	Tgħid lil kulħadd li hi tajba.
He said he wasn't.	Qal li ma kienx.
Or did, once.	Jew għamel, darba.
At that time I was alone	Dak iż-żmien kont waħdi
I haven’t been there for too long	Ma stajtx inkun hemm għal żmien twil wisq
I think that’s all you have to do	Naħseb li dak kollu li għandek tagħmel
He died so quickly.	Huwa miet hekk malajr.
It goes fast.	Imur malajr.
Or, in fact, no he was not.	Jew, fil-fatt, le hu ma kienx.
We have a chance.	Għandna ċans.
I was going home.	Jien kont immur id-dar.
No one had done this before, as far as I know.	Ħadd ma kien għamel dan qabel, sa fejn naf jien.
It may be too late.	Jista’ jkun tard wisq.
You stand here and watch.	Inti toqgħod hawn u tara.
It's just wrong.	Huwa biss ħażin.
I think it looks better that way	Naħseb li jidher aħjar hekk
I thought it was.	Ħsibt li kien.
I need to do something	Għandi bżonn li tagħmel xi ħaġa
I had no problem with that	Ma kellix problema b'dan
The last one.	L-aħħar waħda.
But not every job.	Imma mhux kull xogħol.
Or everything is.	Jew kollox hu.
I didn’t know it was him	Ma kontx naf li kien hu
I think you better come with me now	Naħseb li aħjar tiġi miegħi issa
Lots of money.	Ħafna flus.
I think now.	Naħseb li issa.
I was waiting for it to start.	Kont qed jistenna beda.
And there he is.	U hu hemm.
Like really, now.	Bħal verament, issa.
But that's too little.	Imma dak ftit wisq.
That would be too much.	Dan ikun wisq.
I couldn’t be happier	Jien ma nistax inkun aktar ferħan
Many, many hours.	Ħafna, ħafna sigħat.
I have another idea.	Għandi idea oħra.
I want more.	Irrid aktar.
I couldn't understand why	Ma stajtx nifhem għalfejn xejn
There is nothing you can do about it.	Xejn inti tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
He was happy now, very happy.	Huwa kien kuntent issa, kuntent ħafna.
I never had any children	Qatt ma kelli l-ebda tifel
They are the same.	Huma l-istess.
There must be something more we can do.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa aktar li nistgħu nagħmlu.
Not for me and not for you.	Mhux għalija u mhux għalik.
I was trying so hard	Kont qed nipprova tant
he asked.	staqsa.
I didn’t see this coming at all	Jien ma rajt dan ġej xejn
And that everyone has.	U li kulħadd għandu.
I'm a bit better.	Jien daqsxejn aħjar.
I think it needs some work	Naħseb li jeħtieġ xi xogħol
That would be later.	Dan ikun aktar tard.
I don't have to worry	M'għandix għalfejn inkun inkwetat
I just had enough	Għadni kemm kelli biżżejjed
It could be, of course.	Jista 'jkun, ovvjament.
Like in, now.	Bħal fi, issa.
But he never sees anything.	Imma qatt ma jara xejn.
Now it felt good.	Issa ħassu tajjeb.
You do your thing.	Inti tagħmel ħaġa tiegħek.
You are here with me now.	Qiegħed hawn miegħi issa.
I will do something for you.	Jien se nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik.
She can do it.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan.
This is really good.	Dan huwa tassew tajjeb.
That would never be enough.	Dan qatt ma kien se jkun biżżejjed.
You are nothing to me.	Inti xejn għalija.
Nobody knows who he is.	Ħadd ma jaf min hu.
That's much better.	Dak ħafna aħjar.
I couldn't believe what happened	Ma stajtx nemmen x’ġara
You will be late.	Int tkun tard.
I had an idea once.	Kellek idea darba.
So it seemed to me.	Hekk deher lili.
He needed that car.	Huwa kellu bżonn dik il-karozza.
I did this for you	Jien għamilt dan għalik
Everyone is unemployed.	Kulħadd huwa bla xogħol.
I had to say a lot of things	I kellha għid ħafna affarijiet
You've never been before.	Inti qatt ma kont qabel.
That, of course, takes a very long time.	Li, ovvjament, jieħu żmien twil ħafna.
It wasn’t, of course.	Ma kienx, ovvjament.
Or for me.	Jew għalija.
That was hard, very hard.	Dak kien diffiċli, diffiċli ħafna.
All of the above.	Kollha ta 'hawn fuq.
It was hard work.	Kien xogħol diffiċli.
I was either too busy or too tired	Kont jew wisq okkupat jew għajjien wisq
It's all.	Hu kollu.
I knew you were saying that	Kont naf li int tgħid hekk
I had nothing	Jien ma kelli xejn
I was very, very scared	Kont nibża’ ħafna, ħafna
I live there.	Jien noqgħod hemmhekk.
That could be all.	Dak kollu seta’ jkun.
We did none of this.	Ma għamilna xejn minn dan.
I never saw anything.	Qatt ma rajt xejn.
I didn't even want to go	Lanqas ridt immur
Just to be able to do everything.	Biss biex tkun tista 'tagħmel kollox.
I have to do more	Għandi nagħmel aktar
I can't do that.	Ma nistax nagħmel hekk.
I was not one to regret	Ma kontx wieħed li jiddispjaċini ħafna
I want to see this again	Irrid nara dan mill-ġdid
But this is it.	Imma dan hu.
I didn’t want to, but it just happened.	Jien ma ridtx, imma ġara biss.
He probably had a son by now.	Probabbilment kellu tifel sa issa.
I couldn’t take that	Ma stajtx nieħu dan
I would never tell anyone either	Jien qatt ma ngħid lil ħadd lanqas
I just had to be there	Biss kelli nkun hemm
You go first.	Inti tmur l-ewwel.
It was the last.	Kien l-aħħar.
I can't do anything about it.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn dwar dan.
I was right he wasn't coming	Kelli raġun li ma kienx ġej
No one is saying you should take this.	Ħadd ma qed jgħid li għandek tieħu dan.
I want to be home.	Irrid inkun id-dar.
I'm not saying anything	Jien ma ngħid xejn
I’m not saying anything.	Jien ma ngħid xejn.
I never know what that is	Qatt naf x'inhu dak
Until he.	Sakemm hu.
I had no idea he would come to this	Ma kelli l-ebda idea li se jasal għal dan
This is quite difficult.	Dan huwa pjuttost diffiċli.
I'm not there right now.	Jien mhux hemm bħalissa.
Better there than here.	Aħjar hemmhekk milli hawn.
He sat down for a long time, and was quite happy.	Huwa poġġa bilqiegħda għal żmien twil, u kien pjuttost kuntent.
I did the same thing	Jien għamilt l-istess ħaġa
Maybe I was talking to myself.	Forsi kont jien nitkellem waħdi.
But that was good.	Imma dan kien tajjeb.
I had no friends.	Ma kellix ħbieb.
He didn't.	Huwa ma.
I think so.	Jien naħseb hekk.
Many hours of fun.	Ħafna sigħat ta 'gost.
There weren’t many people around.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna nies madwar.
He had not come to school.	Ma kienx ġie l-iskola.
I was so happy with him	Kont tant kuntent miegħu
He had just died.	Huwa kien għadu kif miet.
It was easy to see who came from where.	Kien faċli tara min ġie minn fejn.
I think it was wrong.	Naħseb li kien ħażin.
He can wait.	Jista’ jistenna.
We knew very little about what happened.	Ma tantx konna nafu dwar dak li ġara.
There is something to that.	Hemm xi ħaġa għal dak.
I was so scared I just wanted to go home	Kont tant nibża’ u ridt biss immur id-dar
I can’t do this alone.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi.
We will do that.	Aħna se nagħmlu dan.
It's just not.	Huwa biss mhux.
Not now, not here.	Mhux issa, mhux hawn.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
Never had before.	Qatt ma kellu qabel.
Neither is he.	Lanqas hu.
I knew this was going to happen	Kont naf li dan kien se jiġri
There were problems	Kien hemm problemi
That he had.	Li kellu.
I suspect he will try	Nissuspetta li se jipprova
I needed to do this, and it just happened	Kelli bżonn nagħmel dan, u ġara biss
But he did better than that.	Imma hu għamel aħjar minn hekk.
I’ve seen this too	Jien stajt nara dan ukoll
I don’t know anything about that.	Jien ma naf xejn dwar dan.
I need something more than that	Għandi bżonn xi ħaġa aktar minn hekk
It's too late.	Huwa tard wisq.
That's what happened.	Hekk ġara.
I was out for three hours at a time	Kont barra għal tliet sigħat kull darba
I can be me.	Jien nista’ nkun jien.
I'm glad to hear that.	Jien ferħan li nisma' dan.
Some other things.	Xi affarijiet oħra.
It wasn’t easy for him.	Ma kienx faċli għalih.
I want to talk to you again soon	Irrid nerġa' nitkellem miegħek dalwaqt
I needed a pretty bad car	Jien kelli bżonn karozza pjuttost ħażin
This is more than enough.	Dan huwa aktar minn biżżejjed.
I can’t take it anymore right now.	Ma nistax nieħu aktar bħalissa.
And nothing works.	U xejn ma jaħdem.
It’s not too hard and works well.	Mhuwiex wisq diffiċli u jaħdem tajjeb.
He said just fine.	Huwa qal biss tajjeb.
No one said it would be easy.	Ħadd ma qal li jkun faċli.
I want some of that.	Irrid ftit minn dan.
There was really nothing that could be done about it.	Verament ma kien hemm xejn li wieħed jista’ jagħmel għalih.
I thought it might be a problem	Ħsibt li tista’ tkun problema
He can do it.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel dan.
As much as you can.	Kemm tista’.
I didn’t know he was here	Ma kontx naf li kien hawn
We did a lot of things together.	Għamilna ħafna affarijiet flimkien.
There was no one there.	Ma kien hemm ħadd hemm.
I believe that everything is as it should be	Nemmen li kollox huwa kif għandu jkun
You really have to.	Int verament għandek.
I understand more than you think	Nifhem aktar milli taħseb
It was something to think about.	Kienet xi ħaġa li taħseb dwarha.
And that was good of me.	U dan kien tajjeb minni.
I’m not going to do that here	Jien mhux se nagħmel dan hawn
There is and it is difficult.	Hemm u huwa diffiċli.
I haven’t been doing very well lately	Ma tantx kont tajjeb dan l-aħħar
I would be very interested to hear what happened	Inkun interessat ħafna nisma' x'ġara
I thought you already knew that	Ħsibt li diġà taf dan
Or something will be wrong.	Jew xi ħaġa se tkun ħażina.
Come here boy.	Ejja hawn tifel.
I know when I say no	Naf meta ngħid le
Your problem.	Il-problema tiegħek.
I want to know everything now	Irrid inkun naf kollox issa
It was a quick job.	Kien xogħol ta’ malajr.
This we already knew.	Dan diġà konna nafu.
It wasn’t at all.	Ma kienx għal kollox.
I can’t think about it now	Ma nistax naħseb dwar dan issa
You know it would.	Taf li kieku.
I didn’t know what I was going to do with it	Ma kontx naf x'se nagħmel minn dan
It may not be a car.	Jista 'ma jkunx karozza.
I had to ask.	Kelli nistaqsi.
I believe you can only be right	Nemmen li inti tista 'biss tkun raġun
I haven’t really thought about it before now	Jien ma tantx ħsibt dwarha qabel issa
I almost wish I would	Kważi nixtieq li kieku
I wasn’t talking back	Ma kontx qed nitkellem lura
He said something else.	Qal xi ħaġa oħra.
I think it would be better if you stay here.	Naħseb li jkun aħjar jekk toqgħod hawn.
I have a lot of time.	Għandi ħafna ħin.
He seemed so small.	Huwa deher daqshekk żgħir.
Just not so little.	Biss mhux daqshekk ftit.
Not a problem anymore.	Mhux problema aktar.
It was just what we needed	Kien biss dak li kellna bżonn
It was hard to see.	Kien diffiċli biex tara.
You can usually tell.	Normalment tista 'tgħid.
Maybe, for him, we were.	Forsi, għalih, konna.
Maybe that was a good thing.	Forsi dik kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
I hope you are happy	Nispera li tkun kuntent
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
In fact, he didn’t.	Fil-fatt, ma kellux.
I didn’t think about anything or anyone	Jien ma ħsibt fuq xejn jew xi ħadd
For me, that was never enough.	Għalija, dan qatt ma kien biżżejjed.
He asked.	Staqsa.
It's been a few hours.	Ilni ftit sigħat.
Always so good.	Dejjem daqshekk tajjeb.
There was more.	Kien hemm aktar.
It may be too late now.	Issa jista’ jkun tard wisq.
I can't tell you what will happen	Ma nistax ngħidlek x'se jiġri
I expect this to be done	Nistenna li dan isir
I saw.	Rajt.
But it was more than that.	Imma kien aktar minn hekk.
To me they are all the same	Għalija huma kollha l-istess
It will, he thought, if it should be so	Se, ħaseb, jekk hekk għandu jkun
I was like that for hours, until morning	Kont hekk għal sigħat, sa filgħodu
There was no need to stand.	Ma kienx hemm bżonn toqgħod.
So here it is.	Hekk hawn.
There they were.	Hemm kienu.
Maybe it was too.	Forsi kienet ukoll.
That's what we did, she says.	Hekk għamilna aħna, tgħid.
I want to know everything you know	Irrid inkun naf dak kollu li taf
I needed time to think.	Kelli bżonn iż-żmien biex naħseb.
I couldn’t see any way everything would work out	Ma stajt nara l-ebda mod kif kollox jaħdem
She is.	Hija hi.
You will soon be unable to speak.	Dalwaqt ma tkunx tista' titkellem.
I had to see what happened	Kelli nara x’ġara
It does.	Dan jagħmel.
He did everything he was supposed to do.	Huwa għamel dak kollu li suppost kellu jagħmel.
I couldn't believe it	Ma stajtx nemmen
He knew they were back.	Kien jaf li kienu lura.
But it happens again.	Imma jerġa' jiġri.
I almost didn’t want to	Jien kważi ma ridtx
The house was beautiful.	Id-dar kienet sabiħa.
I wish it wasn’t morning.	Nixtieq li ma kienx filgħodu.
I couldn't see it anymore	Ma stajtx nara aktar
This is something that will not come often.	Din hija xi ħaġa li mhux se tiġi ta 'spiss.
I didn't even think about it	Lanqas ma kont ħsibt
I thought you’d be home by now	Ħsibt li int tkun id-dar sa issa
I had to do it there	Kelli nagħmel hemmhekk
Quite a bit more.	Pjuttost aktar.
I can do anything you want	Nista' nagħmel kull ħaġa li trid
I need something better	Għandi bżonn xi ħaġa aħjar
I would like to know what it looks like	Nixtieq inkun naf kif jidher
He will stay with us.	Hu se jibqa’ magħna.
I just thought he needed to know that	Ħsibt biss li kellu bżonn ikun jaf dan
It was the first.	Kien l-ewwel.
I have already said too much	Diġà għedt wisq
I think it will do very well.	Naħseb li se jagħmel tajjeb ħafna.
Not a single person there.	Mhux persuna waħda hemmhekk.
There should be more.	Għandu jkun hemm aktar.
You need my help last night.	Għandek bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħi lbieraħ filgħaxija.
We have to be fast.	Irridu nkunu malajr.
It works the first time every time.	Jaħdem l-ewwel darba kull darba.
It can be anything you want it to be.	Jista 'jkun kull ħaġa li trid li tkun.
My first friend.	L-ewwel ħabib tiegħi.
I shouldn't have told anyone.	Suppost ma għedt lil ħadd.
I just wanted to know.	Ridt biss tkun taf.
And we will.	U aħna se.
Now I can see, he wouldn't have	Issa nista' nara, ma kienx ikollu
No, she wasn't going to think about it now.	Le, hi ma kinitx se taħseb dwar dan issa.
But she knew a better way.	Imma hi kienet taf mod aħjar.
I can't think of it right now	Ma nistax naħseb bħalissa
You'll be fine.	Int ser tkun tajjeb.
There is no way around this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ta 'madwar dan.
She was right this afternoon.	Kellha raġun illum wara nofsinhar.
I didn’t know I was back	Ma kontx naf li ġejt lura
This is happening more and more often.	Dan qed jiġri dejjem aktar ta’ spiss.
He could see from here.	Huwa seta' jara minn hawn.
I know you know better than that.	Naf li taf aħjar minn hekk.
He was not here.	Hu ma kienx hawn.
I’ll tell you everything that happened	Jien ngħidlek dak kollu li ġara
I'm scared of everything.	Jien nibża minn kollox.
I had seen this before	Jien kont rajt dan qabel
I have a very good one	Għandi waħda tajba ħafna
I was not difficult.	Ma kontx diffiċli.
He could see that he was.	Huwa seta 'jara li kien.
I'm not very.	Jien ma tantx.
I wanted to be ready if anything happened	Ridt inkun lest jekk jiġri xi ħaġa
I’ll tell you how beautiful she is.	Jien ngħidlek kemm hi sabiħa.
I knew someone was going to say that	Kont naf li xi ħadd kien se jgħid hekk
Do you think they are.	Taħseb li huma.
I was with him forever.	Kont għal dejjem miegħu.
So they were.	Hekk kienu.
I can't be happier.	Ma nistax inkun aktar kuntent.
We both knew this.	Dan it-tnejn konna nafu.
I think you have a problem	Naħseb li għandek problema
I never thought you would do something like that	Qatt ma ħsibt li inti tagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik
I wonder why she did that	Nistaqsi għaliex għamlet dan
You can go or you can stay.	Tista' tmur jew tista' toqgħod.
I didn't know where you were or what happened	Ma kontx naf fejn int jew x’ġara
It was the only thing he could think of doing.	Kienet l-unika ħaġa li seta' jaħseb li jagħmel.
And that wasn't good.	U dan ma kienx tajjeb.
I can't say what he wants	Ma nistax ngħid dak li jrid
And probably more.	U probabbilment aktar.
It looks like this.	Jidher bħal dan.
I want to know everything	Irrid inkun naf kollox
I will always be surprised by this.	Jien dejjem inkun sorpriż b’dan.
This is too late.	Dan huwa tard wisq.
Too late for everything.	Tard wisq għal kollox.
This was not to happen.	Dan ma kellux jiġri.
That’s what you’re doing there.	Dak hu li qed tagħmel hemmhekk.
We will never know.	Qatt mhu se nkunu nafu.
I didn’t know this anyone	Ma kontx naf lil dan xi ħadd
I love our time together	Inħobb il-ħin tagħna flimkien
I tell you.	Jien ngħidlek.
I was the only one in the room	Jien kont l-uniku wieħed fil-kamra
He knew about it.	Kien jaf dwar dan.
I’m not the only one who works all the time.	Jien mhux l-uniku wieħed li jaħdem il-ħin kollu.
But I did.	Imma għamilt.
Now, of course.	Issa, ovvjament.
But there is a problem.	Imma hemm problema.
I probably wouldn't even have a chance to talk to him.	X’aktarx lanqas kont se nkun ċans nitkellem miegħu.
How do you do, my son.	Kif tagħmel, tifel tiegħi.
You need more than that.	Għandek bżonn aktar minn dan.
I know how she is.	Naf kif hi.
Apparently he did.	Milli jidher hekk għamel hu.
I want to know the truth	Nixtieq inkun naf il-verità
I was quite happy.	Kont pjuttost kuntent.
I really can't believe it	Verament ma nistax nemmen
Tell a friend.	Għid lil ħabib.
I think everyone was just tired	Naħseb li kulħadd kien biss għajjien
I didn’t know that.	Jien ma kontx naf li.
I'm back, of course	Jien lura, ovvjament
But it could be just me.	Imma jista 'jkun li jien biss.
It had been done for a long time.	Kien għamel għal żmien twil.
I need to tell you about it	Għandi bżonn ngħidlek dwarha
I knew who they were	Kont naf min kienu
I just want to understand things first	Irrid biss nifhem l-affarijiet l-ewwel
I didn’t want to be late	Ma ridtx inkun tard
I do my job well, though.	Nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi tajjeb, imma.
There they are.	Hemm huma.
I knew you were never coming back	Kont naf li int qatt ma ġejt lura
Not how.	Mhux le kif.
In fact, it’s the same for each and every one.	Fil-fatt, huwa l-istess għal kull wieħed u waħda.
I can wait a bit	Nista' nistenna ftit
I have something more to say	Għandi xi ħaġa aktar xi ngħid
He was a friend and that alone.	Kien ħabib u dan biss.
I don't know what's going on there.	Ma nafx x’qed jiġri hemmhekk.
But he knows.	Imma hu jaf.
I am very wrong.	Għandi ħafna ħażin.
I don't think that's a good idea	Ma naħsibx li din hija idea tajba
I wonder what is going on.	Nistaqsi x’qed jiġri.
And it’s still hard.	U għadu diffiċli.
She had to see.	Hi kellha tara.
This was our only chance.	Dan kien l-uniku ċans tagħna.
I know this is not going to be easy	Naf li dan mhux se jkun faċli
Also, we don't have much.	Barra minn hekk, m'għandniex ħafna.
Anyone can see that.	Kulħadd jista 'jara li.
Well, it couldn't be better.	Ukoll, ma setax ikun tajjeb.
I was waiting for someone	Kont qed nistenna lil xi ħadd
There.	Hemm.
We need help and fast.	Għandna bżonn għajnuna u malajr.
Many years ago.	Ħafna snin ilu.
I really hope not	Verament nittama li le
I have a big problem.	Għandi problema kbira.
It was very good.	Kien tajjeb ħafna.
Everyone knows this.	Kulħadd jaf dan.
That was the first.	Dik kienet l-ewwel.
I doubt it very much.	Niddubita ħafna.
I know how hard this is	Naf kemm dan huwa diffiċli
I knew this was not going to be good	Kont naf li dan mhux se jkun tajjeb
He wasn’t too worried.	Ma kienx wisq inkwetat.
I have nothing wrong with that	M'għandi xejn ħażin xi ngħid dwarha
I just want to be friends	Irrid inkun ħbieb biss
It seems to be going well.	Jidher li sejjer tajjeb.
I really never think	Tassew qatt ma naħseb
I thought it was all over.	Ħsibt li kien kollu kemm hu.
No one is doing that today.	Ħadd mhu qed jagħmel hekk illum.
I hope this helps someone else.	Nittama li dan jgħin lil xi ħadd ieħor.
But no more.	Imma mhux aktar.
I needed to do something now	Kelli bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa issa
I was early and it was out.	Kont kmieni u kien barra.
But you have to tell me.	Imma int għandek tgħidli.
This is not always the case.	Dan mhux dejjem ikun hekk.
But it's easier now.	Imma huwa aktar faċli issa.
I didn’t even hear the door	Lanqas smajt il-bieb
No one can.	Ħadd ma jista’.
I just hope this works.	Nispera biss li dan jaħdem.
Good.	Tajjeb.
She was a person, you see.	Kienet persuna, tara.
He was one man.	Kien raġel wieħed.
That would be great	Dan ikun kbir
More, actually.	Aktar, fil-fatt.
I can understand your problem	Kapaċi nifhem il-problema tiegħek
Maybe you don’t.	Forsi m'għandekx.
I’m here to see it happen	Jien hawn biex nara li jiġri
You know what's going on.	Taf x’inhu jiġri.
I wanted you to come with me	Ridt li tiġi miegħi
That has always been easy.	Dak dejjem kien faċli.
You know she did.	Taf li għamlet.
Bad, bad, bad boy.	Ħażin, ħażin, tifel ħażin.
I don’t know why.	Jien ma nafx għaliex.
You go there.	Inti tmur hemm.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Ma seta’ jagħmel xejn dwar xi ħaġa oħra, jasal għal dak.
I can see where this is going	Nista’ nara fejn sejjer dan
I just need to go and do it myself	Għandi bżonn biss immur u nagħmel jien
I wonder what he was doing here	Nistaqsi x'kien qed jagħmel hawn
I only had until tomorrow	Kelli biss sa għada
Really good friend	Ħabib tassew tajjeb
That wasn’t him.	Dan ma kienx hu.
She had to know.	Hi kellha tkun taf.
I already had enough money	Diġà kelli biżżejjed flus
It may just be a little or a little more.	Jista 'jkun biss ftit jew ftit aktar.
Someone actually came here.	Xi ħadd fil-fatt daħal hawn.
I think it’s much more likely	Naħseb li huwa ħafna aktar probabbli
It won’t be forever.	Mhux se jkun għal dejjem.
I knew something was going on	Kont naf li qed jiġri xi ħaġa
One can never be sure.	Wieħed qatt ma jista’ jkun ċert.
But he must have.	Imma jrid ikollu.
I never did.	Jien qatt ma għamilt.
I just don’t know.	Jien biss ma nafx.
I want to go with him	Irrid immur miegħu
You may not know what it is.	Ma tistax tkun taf x’inhu.
I think there is something to this.	Naħseb li hemm xi ħaġa għal dan.
I had never been here	Qatt ma kelli ġejt hawn
Well, that was it.	Ukoll, dan kien biss.
What's going on.	X'qed jiġri.
I thought so too	Jien kont ħsibt hekk ukoll
I have nothing to say, but good.	M'għandi xejn xi ngħid, imma tajjeb.
I will never be alone again	Qatt ma nkun waħdi mill-ġdid
I didn’t.	Jien ma kontx.
How great that !.	Kemm hu kbir dak!.
I know where this is	Naf fejn hu dan
Just as they were mine.	Hekk kif kienu tiegħi.
You may be surprised.	Inti tista 'tkun sorpriż.
I already knew what had happened	Diġà kont naf x’ġara
I’m good at doing my job	Jien tajjeb biex nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi
And there will be more later.	U jkun hemm aktar aktar tard.
It doesn’t do anymore.	Ma jagħmilx aktar.
Nothing ever stays.	Xejn qatt ma jibqa’.
It was really well done.	Kien verament sar tajjeb.
If you do this everything will work fine.	Jekk tagħmel dan kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
I have to really go.	Ikolli verament immur.
I can tell you this is not good.	Nista 'ngħidlek dan ma jkunx tajjeb.
I have a lot.	Għandi ħafna.
I'm here if you need anything	Jien qiegħed hawn jekk għandek bżonn xi ħaġa
I just really didn’t need this now	I biss verament ma kellix bżonn dan issa
I was ready to go.	Kont lest li mmur.
Also, look around.	Barra minn hekk, ħares madwar.
Obviously we already know why.	Ovvjament diġà nafu għaliex.
And that’s great for me.	U dan għalija huwa kbir.
You can come and go as you please.	Tista’ tiġi u tmur kif trid.
It felt too big.	Ħassu kbir wisq.
Nothing above, and so he did.	Xejn hawn fuq, u hekk għamel.
Everything is as it was.	Kollox huwa kif kien.
A few hours later he would have been glad he wasn’t.	Ftit sigħat wara kien ikun kuntent li ma kienx.
In fact, he did.	Fil-fatt hekk għamel.
It was really great.	Kien tassew tajjeb ħafna.
Just as I wanted.	Eżatt kif ridt.
I was here.	Jien kont hawn.
I'm not sure how long it will take	M'inix ċert kemm se tieħu
Not sure.	Mhux żgur.
I had no idea what it looked like	Ma kellix idea kif kienet tidher
I can't wait to try everything !.	Ma nistax nistenna li nipprova kollox!.
But he lost nothing.	Imma ma tilef xejn.
I knew it was too late, too late	Kont naf li kien tard, tard ħafna
Don't do anything like that.	Ma tagħmel l-ebda ħaġa bħal din.
There was another year.	Kien hemm sena oħra.
It should work.	Għandu jaħdem.
I know everything you will say	Naf dak kollu li se tgħid
They were of and forever.	Kienu ta’ u għal dejjem.
It was now or never.	Kien issa jew qatt.
I know where the school is	Naf fejn hi l-iskola
I need to tell none of this	Għandi bżonn li tgħid lil ħadd minn dan
Here, in the room.	Hawn, fil-kamra.
I'm a boy.	Jien tifel.
And that is what is happening now.	U dan hu dak li qed jiġri issa.
I will do my best to be with you	Nagħmel minn kollox biex inkun miegħek
She wants to be.	Hija trid tkun.
But there was the problem.	Imma kien hemm il-problema.
I see something.	Nara xi ħaġa.
He's just a boy.	Huwa biss tifel.
I really talk about it	I verament nitkellem fuq dan
He loved to talk.	Kien iħobb jitkellem.
I couldn't understand what was going on	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien qed jiġri
I try to see who came out	Nipprova nara min ħareġ
And there are other things to do.	U hemm affarijiet oħra li għandna nagħmlu.
It always has been and always will be.	Dejjem kienet u dejjem se tkun.
Nothing I hadn't seen many times before.	Xejn li ma kontx rajt ħafna drabi qabel.
It wasn’t always easy.	Mhux dejjem kien faċli.
It is the first for you.	Huwa l-ewwel għalik.
I love everything you’ve done here	Inħobb dak kollu li għamilt hawn
They just happened to me.	Huma biss ġara lili.
I did the same.	Jien għamilt l-istess.
He entered the room.	Huwa daħal fil-kamra.
This will not happen again.	Dan mhux se jerġa’ jiġri.
Or so it seemed back then.	Jew hekk deher lura dak iż-żmien.
I wanted to all the time	Ridt il-ħin kollu
I didn't have time.	Ma kellix ħin.
But we did.	Imma għamilna.
But this is something else.	Imma din hija xi ħaġa oħra.
I never know how to say these things	Jien qatt ma naf kif ngħid dawn l-affarijiet
I was alone.	Kont biss.
We need to know why.	Irridu nkunu nafu għaliex.
I would like to do the same here.	Nixtieq nagħmel l-istess hawn.
I couldn’t take it anymore	Ma stajtx nieħu aktar
We can be who we want to be.	Nistgħu nkunu min irridu.
I never have time to do anything	Qatt ma għandi ħin biex nagħmel xejn
I know this is only for this week only	Naf li dan huwa biss għal din il-ġimgħa biss
He was sure she would never tell anyone.	Kien ċert li qatt ma kienet se tgħid lil ħadd.
I was no better than before	Jien ma kontx aħjar minn qabel
I know why you came here	Naf għaliex ġejt hawn
I had a lot of money	Kelli ħafna flus
Not me.	Mhux jien.
I was not happy.	Ma kontx kuntent.
And there you have it	U hemm għandek
I’m not talking about everyone	Mhux qed nitkellem fuq kulħadd
How right he was.	Kemm kellu raġun.
There was a time when it could have happened.	Kien hemm żmien meta seta’ ġara.
Nothing ever happens	Qatt ma jiġri xejn
I'm happy with that	Jien kuntent b'dan
And it wasn't.	U ma kienx.
I want to know why.	Irrid inkun naf għaliex.
I needed to go back.	Kelli bżonn immur lura.
I like to be busy.	Inħobb inkun okkupat.
Really good.	Tajjeb tassew.
You know he couldn't do that.	Taf li ma setax jagħmel dan.
It was so good.	Kien tajjeb hekk.
No idea going home.	L-ebda idea li tmur id-dar.
He did what he had to do.	Huwa għamel dak li kellu jagħmel.
I know there’s more to it than that	Naf li hemm aktar għalija minn hekk
I need to do something of my own today.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa tiegħi llum.
We know you have.	Nafu li għandek.
I want you to do the same	Irrid li tagħmel l-istess
Not yet coming.	Għadu mhux ġej.
I just wanted some time to think	Ridt biss ftit ħin biex naħseb
I almost thought I was him	Kważi ħsibt li kont hu
Say nothing, do nothing.	Tgħid xejn, tagħmel xejn.
I’m really glad I was out of this	Jien tassew kuntent li kont barra minn dan
He could have done without it.	Seta 'jagħmel mingħajr dan.
Everything everyone sees.	Dak kollu jara xi ħadd.
Properly.	Kif suppost.
Just right.	Hekk kif suppost.
I know there is a way	Naf li hemm mod
That's what it is.	Huwa dak li hu.
I didn’t tell anyone	Jien ma għedt lil ħadd
I want to go back to that	Irrid immur lura għal dak
I’m thinking of taking it.	Qed naħseb li nieħu.
I didn’t even think about it	Lanqas ma ħsibt dwarha
Did you know he wants to go.	Kont taf li jkun irid imur.
Not that it will be easy.	Mhux li se jkun faċli.
I wanted to do the same	Jien ridt nagħmel l-istess
I don’t think that’s what you want.	Ma naħsibx li dak li trid.
I just need to do this.	Għandi biss bżonn nagħmel dan.
It’s not as bad as it looks.	Mhuwiex ħażin daqs kemm jidher.
I think it was about that really	Naħseb li kien dwar dan verament
Really, really hard.	Tassew, tassew diffiċli.
But that's what we have to do.	Imma hekk irridu nagħmlu.
I must have passed out or something	I għandu jkun għadda minn barra jew xi ħaġa
Or was it.	Jew kien.
I think it will be good	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb
You can't really tell who he is.	Inti ma tistax verament tgħid min hu.
This is the first way.	Dan huwa l-ewwel mod.
Now that would be something !.	Issa dik tkun xi ħaġa!.
Most likely, it is not.	Aktar probabbli, mhuwiex.
I knew what he was going to say	Kont naf x’se jgħid
He knew he did.	Kien jaf li għamel.
There is one thing he cannot do.	Hemm ħaġa waħda li ma jistax jagħmel.
I wonder if it’s okay.	Nistaqsi jekk hux tajjeb.
Now I can see everything	Issa nista’ nara kollox
I knew this was not going to be easy.	Kont naf li dan mhux se jkun faċli.
Not that it was very difficult.	Mhux li kien diffiċli ħafna.
He started, he thinks.	Beda, jaħseb.
Everyone could see this.	Kulħadd seta' jara dan.
I was not getting any better	Ma kontx sejjer aħjar
So tired.	Għajjien tant.
I still can’t believe this is happening	Għadni ma nistax nemmen li dan qed jiġri
Now you can be sure that it will never happen again.	Issa tista 'tkun ċert li qatt mhu se jerġa' jiġri.
I like to be surprised	Inħobb inkun sorpriż
Not at home yet.	Għadu mhux id-dar.
Time has to say.	Iż-żmien għandu jgħid.
I didn’t know where she was	Ma kontx naf fejn kienet
I had that same problem.	Kelli dik l-istess problema.
I can’t quite tomorrow	Ma nistax pjuttost għada
I wanted to believe.	Ridt nemmen.
This could be.	Dan jista 'jkun.
And we did.	U għamilna.
Not with you.	Mhux miegħek.
There are some things you should do first.	Hemm xi affarijiet li għandek tagħmel l-ewwel.
I knew he would leave soon	Kont naf li se jitlaq dalwaqt
He never knew anything else.	Hu qatt ma kien jaf xi ħaġa oħra.
You are going with me.	Int sejjer miegħi.
Nothing is ever the same.	Xejn mhu qatt l-istess.
It happens a lot.	Jiġri ħafna.
This usually goes very, very wrong.	Dan normalment imur ħażin ħafna, ħafna.
I really live here	Jien tassew noqgħod hawn
It wasn’t me anymore.	Ma kontx aktar jien.
I'm probably not ready	Jien forsi mhux lest
And you came back.	U int ġejt lura.
I was worried about that	Jien kont inkwetat b’dan
How beautiful is that ?.	Kemm hi sabiħa dik?.
How much time he had, he did not know.	Kemm kellu ħin, ma kienx jaf.
I hope this helps someone else.	Nispera li dan jgħin lil xi ħadd ieħor.
You might think that’s not so bad.	Tista' taħseb li mhux daqshekk ħażin.
Not the same anymore.	Mhux l-istess aktar.
I'm here and I'm not going	Jien qiegħed hawn u mhux se mmur
I had a husband before, you know	Kelli raġel qabel, taf
I can say too much	Nista’ ngħid wisq
I don’t want a job.	Ma rridx xogħol.
It never looked the same.	Qatt ma deher l-istess.
I'm not long enough.	Jien mhux twil biżżejjed.
It all happened.	Dan kollu ġara.
I’m not home right now	Jien mhux id-dar bħalissa
Everyone was so good.	Kulħadd kien daqshekk tajjeb.
But it happens too fast.	Imma jiġri malajr wisq.
I need to think about it	Għandi bżonn naħseb dwar dan
So many other things.	Tant affarijiet oħra.
And that's a good thing.	U dik hija ħaġa tajba.
I thought you knew.	Ħsibt li tkun taf.
You will do this because you can.	Inti se tagħmel dan għaliex inti tista '.
I love this and that	Inħobb dan u dan
We will not be able to do anything for everyone.	Mhux se nkunu nistgħu nagħmlu xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
I will always be here.	Jien dejjem inkun hawn.
I see this often.	Dan nara spiss.
Definitely I do.	Żgur li nagħmel.
Nothing good, nothing as it should be.	Xejn tajjeb, xejn kif għandu jkun.
It seems so.	Lil hekk jidher.
The problem is something else.	Il-problema hija xi ħaġa oħra.
I don’t need that.	M'għandix bżonn dak.
Lots of work that was	Ħafna xogħol li kien
No one will ever know.	Ħadd qatt ma jista’ jkun jaf.
I can take more work.	Kapaċi nieħu aktar xogħol.
Everyone was on top of each other.	Kulħadd kien fuq xulxin.
I don't think so.	Ma naħsibx hekk.
There he went outside.	Hemmhekk għadda barra.
I probably was, too.	I probabbilment kien, wisq.
He did not want to leave.	Ma riedx jitlaq.
Probably not yet.	X'aktarx li għadu mhux.
He was what they were after.	Huwa kien dak li kienu wara.
We do everything together.	Nagħmlu kollox flimkien.
I like being with him like that	Inħobb inkun miegħu hekk
But it looks good.	Imma jidher tajjeb.
I have what you say you need	Għandi dak li tgħid li għandek bżonn
How bad has it become ?.	Kemm sar ħażin?.
She never was.	Hija qatt ma kienet.
I know why.	Inkun naf għaliex.
If it were.	Kieku kien.
I have no such problem	M'għandi l-ebda problema bħal din
They are enough.	Huma biżżejjed.
It just isn’t.	Hija biss mhix.
I hadn't heard anything	Ma kont smajt xejn
Where she was.	Fejn kienet hi.
Bla bla bla bla.	Bla bla bla bla.
I didn't have to know what it was	Ma kellix għalfejn inkun naf x’kien
Why did they feel that way.	Għaliex ħassu hekk.
I don't have any more.	M'għandix aktar.
I know you do too	Naf li inti tagħmel ukoll
I can’t just sit here and see this anymore.	Ma nistax biss noqgħod hawn u nara dan aktar.
I see and know what you had with you	Nara u naf dak li kellek miegħek
It was afternoon.	Kien wara nofsinhar.
You too.	Int ukoll .
I can only tell you what to expect.	Nista’ ngħidlek biss x’għandu jkun hemm.
It was definitely too early to do that.	Żgur li kien kmieni wisq biex tagħmel dan.
I'm there with you	Jien qiegħed hemm miegħek
I hadn’t done this before	Jien ma kontx għamilt dan qabel
I have to try	Għandi nipprova
I could tell how good it was	Stajt ngħid kemm kien tajjeb
I was pretty scared at the time.	I kien pjuttost jibża 'dak iż-żmien.
I don’t think there’s a way around this.	Ma naħsibx li hemm mod madwar dan.
That was a year ago.	Dak kien sena ilu.
I’m not sure how I do that.	M'inix ċert kif nagħmel dan.
He stood there and looked.	Huwa kien hemm u ħares.
I hope she was right.	Jien nittama li kellha raġun.
I can't think of that	Ma nistax naħseb dwar dan
But you don’t have that much money now.	Imma m'għandekx daqshekk flus issa.
I can't try.	Ma nistax nipprova.
Or he thinks he did.	Jew jaħseb li għamel.
No, nothing.	Le, xejn.
I suspect it may not be there	Nissuspetta li jista’ ma jkunx hemm
Definitely was.	Żgur li kien.
I'm not going there	Jien mhux sejjer hemm
Everyone wants to go.	Kulħadd irid imur.
I wasn’t going to tell you that	Jien ma kontx se ngħidlek dan
I need to do this	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan
If it weren’t, it wouldn’t be.	Kieku ma kienx, ma kienx.
I never thought he would come here	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jiġi hawn
It would have been so easy.	Kieku kien daqshekk faċli.
I had never seen it happen before	Qatt ma kont rajt jiġri qabel
I think that’s all I really need	Naħseb li huwa dak kollu li jeħtieġ verament
You go on.	Inti tmur fuq.
That's it.	Dak hu.
I thought maybe she knew something	Ħsibt li forsi kienet taf xi ħaġa
We do work.	Aħna nagħmlu xogħol.
It could be more.	Jista 'jkun aktar.
I didn’t really think about it	Ma tantx ħsibt dwarha
I’m still trying to understand.	Għadu nipprova nifhem.
There is the door.	Hemm il-bieb.
No more.	Mhux aktar minn hekk.
I think we know fast enough	Naħseb li nafu malajr biżżejjed
I didn’t want to go back because I didn’t have anyone	Ma ridtx immur lura biex ma kelli lil ħadd
Was he sure of that? 	Kien ċert minn dan?
asked.	talab.
Not that they ever are, but whatever.	Mhux li qatt huma, imma tkun xi tkun.
I once knew a man like that	Darba kont naf raġel hekk
It's here now.	Huwa hawn issa.
It takes a long time to actually see everything.	Huwa jieħu ħafna żmien biex fil-fatt tara kollox.
I wish there was a better way	Nixtieq li jkun hemm mod aħjar
We need more and more and more.	Għandna bżonn aktar u aktar u aktar.
I knew it was going to happen.	Kont naf li se jiġri.
But she was the only one.	Imma hi kienet l-unika waħda.
I was already pretty busy today	Diġà kont okkupat pjuttost illum
She had little to think about.	Kellha ftit biex taħseb.
So said everyone.	Hekk qal kulħadd.
I haven't seen anyone yet	Għadni ma stajt nara lil ħadd
It was really hard for me.	Kien tassew diffiċli għalija.
I'm really wrong	Jien tassew għandi ħażin
I knew he was right.	Kont naf li kellu raġun.
I don’t want to go back out there tomorrow.	Ma rridx immur lura hemm barra għada.
I know it's not easy	Naf li ma jkunx faċli
Well, it was.	Ukoll, kien.
Something was better than nothing.	Xi ħaġa kienet aħjar minn xejn.
This was not the case.	Dan ma kienx.
Where that will be, we never know.	Fejn se jkun dak, qatt ma nafu.
I think everyone did.	Naħseb li kulħadd għamel.
Tell me how to do it.	Għid kif tagħmel.
Very long time indeed.	Żmien twil ħafna tassew.
By then, it was too late.	Sa dak iż-żmien, kien tard wisq.
It was never bad.	Qatt ma kien ħażin.
I didn’t hope for that	Ma kontx nittama għal dan
It happens often.	Jiġri spiss.
Or it doesn't look good.	Jew ma tantx jidher tajjeb.
Along with something else.	Flimkien ma' ħaġa oħra.
Everything had gone wrong.	Kollox kien mar ħażin.
Everything you need is here.	Dak kollu li għandek bżonn qiegħed hawn.
He was so tired.	Kien tant għajjien.
I didn’t want to	Jien ma kontx ridt
I didn't need anyone	Ma kelli bżonn lil ħadd
I’m willing to try this	Jien lest li nipprova dan
It wasn’t too much but it was better than nothing.	Ma kienx wisq imma kien aħjar minn xejn.
Whatever you want it to be.	Tkun xi tkun trid li tkun.
He did it all.	Huwa għamel dan kollu.
She certainly did.	Hija żgur li għamlet.
No one saw what was coming.	Ħadd ma ra dak ġej.
No one was there.	Ħadd ma kien hemm.
I'm still here for you	Għadni hawn għalik
I was really worried.	Kont tassew inkwetat.
I knew he would do it	Kont naf li se tagħmel dan
I couldn't understand what was going on.	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien qed jiġri.
It says so right here.	Jgħid hekk eżatt hawn.
I knew what he wanted.	Kont naf xi ried.
And he knows it.	U dan jaf.
You heard of it.	Int smajt b'dan.
I know what's coming, here it comes.	Naf x'inhu ġej, hawn ġej.
I haven’t even thought about it before	Lanqas ma ħsibt dwarha qabel
I had done it before.	Kont għamilt qabel.
I think you have to be like that	Naħseb li trid tkun hekk
Don't do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan.
It doesn't have to.	M'għandux għalfejn.
I haven’t seen much after that	Ma tantx rajt wara dak
I can still hear everyone talking	Għadni noqgħod nisma’ lil kulħadd jitkellem
When you think about it.	Meta taħseb dwarha.
It’s easier when someone else is working with you.	Huwa aktar faċli meta xi ħadd ieħor ikun qed jaħdem miegħek.
Not that there was much time to eat.	Mhux li kien hemm ħafna ħin biex tiekol.
I wanted time to think	Ridt żmien biex naħseb
Someone else has to do it.	Xi ħadd ieħor irid jagħmel dan.
I thought it was you	Ħsibt li kont int
Quick and easy.	Malajr u faċli.
It should appear.	Għandu jidher.
He couldn’t do anything.	Ma setax jagħmel xi ħaġa.
I just wanted to go home	Ridt biss nerġa’ lura d-dar
That's right.	Huwa hekk.
We were friends for many years, but that time passed.	Konna ħbieb għal ħafna snin, imma dak iż-żmien għadda.
I will soon be very big	Jien dalwaqt se nkun kbir ħafna
I can't eat anymore.	Ma nistax niekol aktar.
Timing is what you need right now.	Iż-żmien huwa dak li għandek bżonn bħalissa.
You say you should, but you shouldn’t, not really.	Tgħid li għandek, imma m'għandekx, mhux verament.
Too small for me now, really.	Żgħir wisq għalija issa, tassew.
I wanted to do a good job	Ridt nagħmel xogħol tajjeb
I knew he would do that	Kont naf li se tagħmel hekk
Don't think that.	M'għandekx taħseb li.
I never wanted to.	Qatt ma ridt.
That wasn’t easy, either.	Dan ma kienx faċli, lanqas.
I'm so easy.	Jien faċli hekk.
Good friend.	Ħabib tajjeb.
Besides, he wouldn't be here for long.	Barra minn hekk, ma kienx se jkun hawn għal żmien twil.
I needed to take it all in stride	Kelli bżonn nieħu dan kollu
I had to tell you so	Kelli ngħidlek hekk
Well, they didn't.	Ukoll, huma ma.
I was never happy.	Jien qatt kont kuntent.
I love this school and everyone here	Jien inħobb din l-iskola u lil kulħadd hawn
I had no money	Ma kellix flus
Probably more than one.	Probabbilment aktar minn wieħed.
I see nothing more that we can do now	Ma nara xejn aktar li nistgħu nagħmlu issa
He just took it.	Huwa biss ħa.
Definitely they are.	Żgur li huma.
Not that it was so early.	Mhux li kien daqshekk kmieni.
I eat that every morning	Jien niekol dak kull filgħodu
We do not have enough help.	M'għandniex biżżejjed għajnuna.
I know he doesn't like to stay there	Naf li ma jħobbx jibqa’ hemm
He had seen.	Huwa kien ra.
This is not you.	Dan mhux int.
Or it may not be.	Jew jista 'ma jkunx.
I heard about this later.	Smajt dwar dan aktar tard.
I’m not supposed to know that	Jien mhux suppost naf dan
What was there to.	Dak li kien hemm biex.
I could still see a little	Għadni stajt nara ftit
I didn’t want to go see things.	Ma ridtx immur nara l-affarijiet.
I knew it was going to happen	Kont naf li kien se jiġri
I'm glad he's mine.	Jien kuntent li hu tiegħi.
It could have been more.	Seta’ kien aktar.
Just one idea.	Idea waħda biss.
But obviously they are doing something.	Imma ovvjament qed jagħmlu xi ħaġa.
He was not the only one.	Ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
I didn’t know how long it would take	Ma kontx naf kemm kien se jieħu
I’ll tell you something else.	Jien ngħidlek xi ħaġa oħra.
We did nothing.	Aħna ma għamilna xejn.
I didn’t, I can’t, I do.	Ma kontx, ma nistax, nagħmel hekk.
You can’t sit for long.	Ma tistax toqgħod bilqiegħda għal żmien twil.
Sorry, but often.	Jiddispjaċini, imma ħafna drabi.
I was just thinking about you	Kont biss naħseb għalik
I saw this become that.	Rajt dan isir dak.
There is a time.	Hemm żmien.
There was another one.	Kien hemm wieħed ieħor.
I shouldn’t be too long	M'għandix inkun twil wisq
This dog is so good.	Dan il-kelb huwa tant tajjeb.
I hope you can as well	Nispera li inti tista 'kif hekk
I didn't hear anything	Jien ma smajt xejn
There is something else.	Hemm ħaġa oħra.
I thought it would be harder	Ħsibt li jkun aktar diffiċli
He just doesn’t like to sit down.	Huwa biss ma jħobbx joqgħod bilqiegħda.
Everyone had the same chance	Kulħadd kellu l-istess ċans
I will do this for you if you wish	Jien se nagħmel dan għalik jekk tixtieq
I didn’t think of anything	Jien ma kont naħseb xejn
I believe this I am.	Jien nemmen dan jien.
Obviously, this will not work.	Ovvjament, dan mhux se jaħdem.
I know nothing.	Jien ma naf xejn.
It seems.	Jidher.
I had to see this	I kellha nara dan
You can’t do both.	Ma tistax tagħmel it-tnejn.
I try not to think.	Nipprova ma naħsibx.
He actually did.	Huwa fil-fatt għamel.
I didn’t know where I was going to go, or who I was going to believe	Ma kontx naf fejn se mmur, jew lil min se nemmen
Never worried once.	Qatt inkwetat darba.
Everyone is watching this.	Kulħadd qed jara dan.
You can't do better.	Ma tistax tagħmel aħjar.
When she did, she didn't know.	Meta dan ikun, hi ma kinitx taf.
I was here a few hours ago with a friend	Kont hawn ftit sigħat ilu ma’ ħabib
It's just as well.	Huwa biss kif ukoll.
One that doesn't.	Wieħed li ma.
I couldn't wait	Ma stajtx noqgħod nistenna
Lots of fun.	Ħafna gost.
This can happen quite quickly.	Dan jista 'jiġri pjuttost malajr.
It seems I can't think	Jidher li ma nistax naħseb
That was who she was, what she did.	Dik kienet min kienet, dak li għamlet.
I wanted it well.	Ridt tajjeb.
Maybe something else.	Forsi xi ħaġa oħra.
Well, very often.	Ukoll, ħafna drabi.
How much work that would be.	Kemm ikun xogħol dak.
But this is not enough.	Imma dan mhux biżżejjed.
If he could be here with you, you know he would.	Li kieku jista’ jkun hawn miegħek, taf li kieku.
I can’t do that, you know.	Ma nistax nagħmel hekk, taf.
I want to know how this happened	Irrid inkun naf kif ġara dan
Not so here.	Mhux hekk hawn.
But we can do better.	Imma nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar.
If you really don't want to.	Jekk verament ma tridx.
More such things.	Aktar affarijiet bħal dawn.
I have something to say	Għandi xi ngħid
I will talk about wanting a child	Se nitkellem dwar li trid tifel
Like, too long.	Bħal, twil wisq.
I have been doing this for some time.	Ilni nagħmel dan għal xi żmien.
There are these.	Hemm dawn.
I too could eat something	Jien ukoll stajt niekol xi ħaġa
I used to be you once	Jien kont inkun int darba
It came so.	Daħal hekk.
It’s harder than it looks.	Huwa aktar diffiċli milli jidher.
That's it.	Dik hija li.
Probably not.	X'aktarx le.
But that’s what he needed.	Imma dak hu li kellu bżonn.
When no one else is watching.	Meta ħadd ieħor ma jkun qed jara.
I know this is a bad time	Naf li dan huwa żmien ħażin
I can't tell you otherwise	Ma nistax ngħidlek mod ieħor
He should be home by now.	Huwa għandu jkun id-dar sa issa.
It could have been someone.	Seta’ kien xi ħadd.
It may be the same now.	Jista 'jkun l-istess issa.
There was nothing to make it better.	Ma kien hemm xejn li jagħmel dan aħjar.
Not everyone did.	Mhux kulħadd għamel.
I think he should come with me.	Naħseb li għandu jiġi miegħi.
I know that in.	Naf li fi.
There were other problems	Kien hemm problemi oħra
Now he wouldn’t have had enough.	Issa ma kienx ikollu biżżejjed.
I understand there may be more about this as well	Nifhem li jista' jkun hemm aktar dwar hawn ukoll
I was surprised to see this.	Kont sorpriż li nara dan.
I couldn’t do it alone.	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan waħdi.
This is what it's really all about.	Dan huwa dak li huwa verament kollha dwar.
Of friends now.	Ta’ ħbieb issa.
Everyone could see that	Kulħadd seta' jara dan
You’re not too bad.	M'intix ħażin wisq.
I say who can come and who can go.	Jien ngħid min jista’ jiġi u min jista’ jmur.
I still can’t believe I did that	Għadni ma nistax nemmen li għamilt hekk
She knew she would never come back.	Kienet taf li qatt ma kien se jiġi lura.
A bit wrong, probably.	Daqsxejn ħażin, probabbilment.
He sat down.	Huwa poġġa bilqiegħda.
We were just there.	Konna biss hemm.
I can't tell you anything	Jista’ jkun li ma nista’ ngħidlek xejn
You said it was a big job.	Inti għedt li kien xogħol kbir.
I went to the next one.	Jien mort għal dak ta’ wara.
He didn't want to see any more.	Ma riedx jara aktar.
This is usually enough for me.	Dan normalment huwa biżżejjed għalija.
It wasn’t going to happen.	Ma kienx se jiġri.
I think it’s a great idea.	Naħseb li hija idea kbira.
I wonder what will happen to me	Nistaqsi x'se jiġri lili
I wonder how it is going	Nistaqsi kif sejjer
Come as you are.	Ejja kif int.
He is a boy.	Huwa tifel.
This is being done.	Dan qed isir.
I couldn’t believe it had been a long time	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien għadda ħafna ħin
I knew nothing more than I did	Jien ma kont naf xejn aktar milli kont
So be it.	Hekk ikun.
It's just us.	Huwa biss aħna.
So much for this.	Tant għal dan.
But there is one thing we know for sure.	Imma hemm ħaġa waħda li nafu żgur.
You were there.	Int kont hemm.
I know you know something	Naf li taf xi ħaġa
It has never happened before.	Qatt ma ġara qabel.
That’s pretty much it actually.	Dak huwa pjuttost fil-fatt.
That was good for me.	Dak kien tajjeb miegħi.
I have to be with him	Ikolli nkun miegħu
I thought it was just	Ħsibt li kien biss
I haven't been there in a long time	Ilni ma kontx hemm
Look back there.	Ħares lura hemm.
But few actually do.	Imma ftit fil-fatt jagħmlu.
I am doing this for you	Qed nagħmel dan għalik
Suffice it to say.	Dan huwa biżżejjed li ngħid.
Maybe you were right.	Forsi kellek raġun.
I thought he would be here	Ħsibt li se jkun hawn
Surely I can do that	Żgur li nista' nagħmel hekk
So are you, probably.	Hekk int, probabbilment.
I want to know why I did this	Irrid inkun naf għaliex għamilt dan
Or try.	Jew ipprova.
I think we need each other more than ever	Naħseb li għandna bżonn lil xulxin aktar minn qatt qabel
I’m sure it works for you and many other people.	Jien ċert li jaħdem għalik u għal ħafna nies oħra.
I was tired of waiting.	Kont għajjien nistenna.
But more on that later.	Imma aktar dwar dan aktar tard.
This is not good.	Dan mhux tajjeb.
Afterwards, we knew a lot.	Wara, konna nafu ħafna.
I really needed someone to talk to at that time	Verament kelli bżonn xi ħadd biex nitkellem miegħu dak il-ħin
He looked tired.	Huwa deher għajjien.
I want to eat something	Irrid niekol xi ħaġa
This would not be difficult.	Dan ma jkunx diffiċli.
He shouldn't have.	Ma kellux ikollu.
I don’t know much about it either.	Ma nafx wisq dwarha lanqas.
He had not seen it coming.	Ma kienx ra li ġej.
Someone has to work.	Xi ħadd irid jaħdem.
I just want to know what happened	Irrid inkun naf biss x’ġara
This has never happened before.	Dan qatt ma ġara hekk.
I was just one man.	Kont raġel wieħed biss.
I wish we had it forever	Nixtieq li kellna għal dejjem
Nothing will ever be the same again.	Xejn qatt ma jerġa’ jkun l-istess.
It’s a thing to do.	Hija ħaġa li tagħmel.
I can't say who.	Ma nistax ngħid min.
It was she who knew.	Kienet hi li tkun taf.
Just know that.	Biss taf li.
But tomorrow will come.	Imma għada se tiġi.
He was trying to stay on top of things.	Huwa kien qed jipprova jibqa 'fuq l-affarijiet.
And here it was.	U hawn kien.
He can prove it.	Jista 'jipprova dan.
But she was right.	Imma kellha raġun.
Maybe just one person.	Forsi persuna waħda biss.
And that was good.	U dan kien tajjeb.
I can’t say the same	Ma nistax ngħid l-istess
But after you think, so do you.	Imma wara li taħseb, hekk jagħmel.
For one, you are what you eat.	Għal waħda, inti dak li tiekol.
Will be back much later.	Ser jiġi lura ħafna aktar tard.
We both know what needs to be done here.	It-tnejn nafu x’hemm bżonn isir hawn.
I did.	Jien għamilt.
I didn’t want you to see this	Ma ridtx li inti tara dan
Everyone who works there.	Kull min jaħdem hemm.
One very big one to come to see	Waħda kbira ħafna li wasal biex jara
You must have been her.	Trid kienet hi.
I didn’t want to ask	Ma ridtx nistaqsi
I just want to talk to you	Irrid biss nitkellem miegħek
Maybe you don’t have one.	Forsi m'għandekx waħda.
He may have been right.	Jista’ jkun li kellu raġun.
I tell you it's hard	Jien ngħidlek li huwa diffiċli
I'm really happy for you	Jien tassew kuntent għalik
It never was.	Qatt ma kien.
Maybe someday it will.	Forsi xi darba se.
I hope not.	Nittama li le.
Who do you think.	Min taħseb.
I probably played it before, I know who it is	I probabbilment kellu qabel dan, naf min hu
It's not usually something you talk about with everyone.	Normalment ma tkunx xi ħaġa li titkellem dwarha ma’ kulħadd.
Not so, quite.	Mhux hekk, pjuttost.
It makes this easier.	Jagħmel dan aktar faċli.
I didn't see anything	Jien ma rajt xejn
I was listening today	Illum kont qed nisma’
You've really come up with something.	Int verament stajt ma' xi ħaġa.
I would like to do more as well.	Nixtieq li jagħmlu aktar ukoll.
He was not coming home.	Ma kienx ġej id-dar.
But there was something he needed to do now.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa li kellu bżonn jagħmel issa.
Everything works properly.	Kollox jaħdem kif suppost.
Quick, please.	Malajr, jekk jogħġbok.
Well you can say so.	Ukoll tista 'tgħid hekk.
And not just yours.	U mhux tiegħek biss.
Really needed.	Tassew bżonn.
I don't need to know	M'għandix għalfejn inkun naf
I know it will help.	Naf li se jgħin.
Be so! 	Ikun hekk!
I think he’s there now.	Naħseb li qiegħed hemm issa.
There is only a chance.	Hemm biss ċans.
I have to be able to do that	Għandi nkun kapaċi nagħmel dan
I can't understand why.	Ma nistax nifhem għaliex.
You’re not saying he is.	Mhux qed tgħid li hu.
There was really only one thing he needed to know.	Kien hemm tassew ħaġa waħda biss li kellu bżonn ikun jaf.
And he died.	U miet.
I was tired of being alone	Kont għajjien li nkun waħdi
But someone else did.	Imma xi ħadd ieħor għamel.
I don't want to.	Ma rridx.
Everything looks better than it has ever had before.	Kollox jidher aħjar milli qatt kellu qabel.
I had to be here	I kellha tkun hawn
He won’t have to know.	Mhux se jkollu għalfejn ikun jaf.
He is the same man.	Huwa l-istess raġel.
He could have done it.	Huwa seta 'għamel.
It could be.	Jista’ jkun.
Something else was needed.	Kien hemm bżonn xi ħaġa oħra.
U le le.	U le le.
Tomorrow, he thought.	Għada, ħaseb.
And maybe.	U forsi.
This was not a bad thing.	Din ma kinitx xi ħaġa ħażina.
I wanted something to happen.	Ridt li jiġri xi ħaġa.
I can’t take back what happened.	Ma nistax nieħu lura dak li ġara.
I couldn’t do anything.	Jien ma stajt nagħmel xejn.
So it was forever, and forever.	Hekk kien għal dejjem, u għal dejjem.
What it takes to be happy.	X’hemm bżonn biex tkun kuntent.
He is a boy.	Huwa tifel.
I don’t and won’t	Jien m'għandix u mhux se
Well, that's really it.	Ukoll, dak huwa verament.
He is a person.	Huwa persuna.
I do it alone.	Jien nagħmel dan waħdi.
Or maybe she did.	Jew forsi għamlet.
After who knows.	Wara min jaf.
We have been doing this for years.	Dan għamilna snin.
Now I can see.	Issa nista' nara.
I wonder all this time	Jien nistaqsi dan il-ħin kollu
Tell your friend.	Għid lil ħabib tiegħek.
I think you can do whatever you want	Naħseb li tista 'tagħmel dak kollu li trid
We have since, you know.	Aħna għandna minn dak iż-żmien, taf.
I wonder where he went	Nistaqsi fejn mar
Maybe he did.	Forsi hekk għamel.
I haven't really worried about that before	I ma tantx inkwetat dwar dan qabel
It was just a good fit.	Kien biss tajjeb tajjeb.
Not just as it looks.	Mhux biss kif tidher.
I think it will be this week.	Naħseb li se jkun din il-ġimgħa.
I was not afraid of anything	Ma kont nibża’ xejn
Most are easy.	Ħafna huma faċli.
I would like to see one	Nixtieq nara waħda
I was good, but good was not good enough.	Kont tajjeb, imma tajjeb ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed.
I shouldn't talk to him	M'għandix nitkellem miegħu
I went to his house once	Jien mort id-dar tiegħu darba
Time ahead.	Ħin qabel iż-żmien.
Both are very easy to do.	It-tnejn huma faċli ħafna li jagħmlu.
That's a great thing.	Dik hija ħaġa kbira.
I was glad to sit down	Kont ferħan li noqgħod bilqiegħda
I would be scared of him there	Inkun nibża miegħu hemmhekk
She didn’t even do that.	Hija lanqas ma għamlet dan.
Not even to think much of.	Lanqas biex taħseb ħafna.
I will never tell you, ever.	Qatt ma ngħidlek, qatt.
From here it's easy.	Minn hawn huwa faċli.
I couldn’t believe he would come back, but he did	Ma stajtx nemmen li se jiġi lura, imma hekk għamel
I listen.	Jien nisma'.
I want to be something	Irrid inkun xi ħaġa
Why not? 	Għaliex le?
it is supposed to.	huwa suppost.
He is here.	Huwa qiegħed hawn.
I have work for him tomorrow	Għandi xogħol għalih għada
There must be some other way, he thought.	Għandu jkun hemm xi mod ieħor, ħaseb.
I didn’t want to tell you that, now.	Ma ridtx ngħidlek hekk, issa.
I can see everything	Nista’ nara kollox
We were both.	Konna t-tnejn.
He just wants to.	Huwa biss irid.
Nobody is happy.	Ħadd mhu kuntent.
But that's it.	Imma dak hu.
But they have to.	Imma għandhom.
It should not only be good but really good.	Għandu mhux biss ikun tajjeb imma tassew tajjeb.
I really hope he doesn’t	Verament nittama li ma jagħmilx hekk
You don't want to, but you will.	Inti ma tridx, imma int se.
Not now, not tomorrow.	Mhux issa, mhux għada.
They are doing a good job.	Qed jagħmlu xogħol tajjeb.
I think that’s what I said	Naħseb li huwa dak li għedt
I would be yours, and yours alone.	Jien inkun tiegħek, u tiegħek biss.
You will not tell your people anything.	Inti mhux se tgħid nies tiegħek xi ħaġa.
And we do.	U nagħmlu hekk.
You have to be quick.	Trid tkun malajr.
I’m not a good looking man	Jien m'iniex raġel li jidher tajjeb
That will be a few hours.	Dak se jkun ftit sigħat.
Please, you must.	Jekk jogħġbok, trid.
There is nothing better than this.	M'hemm xejn aħjar minn dan.
I have to do another one	Għandi nagħmel ieħor
But how.	Imma kif.
I know he will be here	Naf li se jkun hawn
I thought they were mine to do	Ħsibt li kienu tiegħi biex nagħmel
I couldn’t do it alone	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan waħdi
I think that would be a big, big thing	Naħseb li tkun ħaġa kbira, kbira
He knew everything.	Kien jaf kollox.
There are more of the latter than the former, if that helps.	Hemm aktar ta 'l-aħħar minn ta' l-ewwel, jekk dan jgħin.
And it most likely will.	U huwa probabbli ħafna li se.
But of course you do.	Imma ovvjament tagħmel hekk.
I’m not even sure how that happened.	Jien lanqas ċert kif dan ġara.
You are not going to say no.	M'intix se tgħid le.
I had too much.	Kelli wisq.
And there was nothing we could do.	U ma kien hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu.
I need to prove who you are	Għandi bżonn biex nipprova min int
I can be difficult	Nista’ nkun diffiċli
He has a great time.	Huwa għandu ħafna ħin.
Just to see.	Biss biex tara.
I can’t do everything.	Ma nistax nagħmel kollox.
I thought it was going well	Ħsibt li kien sejjer tajjeb
I have no idea where she is	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn hi
And they are your friends.	U huma ħbieb tiegħek.
This has happened often, in fact.	Dan ġara spiss, fil-fatt.
You know what's coming.	Taf x’qed ġej.
No one knew better.	Ħadd ma kien jaf aħjar.
We made that one.	Għamilna dik waħda.
I heard about it later	Smajt dwarha aktar tard
But it was me.	Imma kont jien.
Now she was tired.	Issa kienet għajjien.
I was sure there was more	Kont ċert li kien hemm aktar
This is what has happened now.	Dan huwa dak li ġara issa.
Everything is ready.	Kollox lest.
Well, something like that.	Ukoll, xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I knew he wasn’t going to be happy.	Kont naf li ma kienx se jkun kuntent.
No, it's not mine.	Le, mhuwiex tiegħi.
You know, that’s a great thing someone says.	Taf, din hija ħaġa kbira li xi ħadd jgħid.
I know this is difficult.	Naf li dan huwa diffiċli.
I do everything wrong, everything	Nagħmel kollox ħażin, kollox
They don't.	Huma ma .
In fact, very large.	Fil-fatt, kbir ħafna.
I will not go back.	Jien mhux se mmur lura.
No, no, just a little.	Le, le, ftit biss.
Nothing is too small	Xejn mhu żgħir wisq
Now I see how everything went properly	Issa nara kif kollox ġara kif suppost
He was here before.	Kien hawn qabel.
But she is.	Imma hi.
It hadn't been here in a long time.	Kien ilu ma kien hawn fuq.
Last time I had to be there.	L-aħħar darba kelli nkun hemm.
I can tell there.	Nista 'ngħid hemmhekk.
I can see pretty well.	Nista' nara pjuttost tajjeb.
I, for one, almost never did	Jien, għal waħda, kważi qatt ma għamilt
They were friends with many people.	Kienu ħbieb ma’ ħafna nies.
What she did was wrong.	Dak li għamlet kien ħażin.
It may never happen.	Jista' jkun li qatt ma jiġri.
No, you are not capable.	Le, m'intix kapaċi.
And it is very difficult.	U huwa diffiċli ħafna.
I am doing more than that now	Qed nagħmel aktar minn hekk issa
He did everything.	Għamel dak kollu.
I hope you can do that	Qed nittama li tista' tagħmel hekk
You want someone who really takes what you want.	Trid lil xi ħadd li verament jieħu dak li trid.
Unless you do.	Sakemm ma tagħmilx.
I can’t believe he will do that	Ma nistax nemmen li se tagħmel hekk
I hope you are.	Nispera li inti.
And every year, more and more people are doing it.	U kull sena, aktar u aktar nies qed jagħmlu dan.
She had to come.	Hi kellha tiġi.
Not as often as he wanted.	Mhux ta’ spiss daqskemm ried.
We only know.	Nafu biss.
I needed your help	Kelli bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek
He can speak.	Jista’ jitkellem.
It was so fast.	Kien daqshekk malajr.
It will definitely be better now.	Hija żgur li se tkun aħjar issa.
I always thought you were too	Dejjem ħsibt li int ukoll
I know you're there	Naf li int hemm
But there is one thing.	Imma hemm ħaġa waħda.
Sometimes she was that.	Xi drabi hi kienet dik.
He really wants to work.	Huwa verament irid jaħdem.
I can never go back with him	Qatt ma nista’ nerġa’ lura miegħu
No one is around.	Ħadd mhu madwar.
No one had died.	Ħadd ma kien miet.
I still can't tell you anything else	Għadni ma nistax ngħidlek xi ħaġa oħra
He wants something.	Irid xi ħaġa.
That never happened.	Dak qatt ma ġara.
Pretty long.	Pjuttost ħin.
Not mine either.	Lanqas tiegħi.
I think it would be nice	Naħseb li tkun sabiħa
I have never done anything like this	Qatt ma għamilt xi ħaġa bħal din
Now you have me.	Issa għandek lili.
Why was it so late?	Għaliex kienet tard hekk?.
It wasn’t bad, it was really good.	Ma kienx ħażin, kien tassew tajjeb.
I just, you know, thought.	Jien biss, taf, ħsibt.
This was done here.	Dan sar hawn.
Not bad and not great	Mhux ħażin u mhux kbir
He may be right.	Jista’ jkun li jkollu raġun.
I was hoping you would be home soon	Kont nittama li inti tkun id-dar dalwaqt
He tells everyone what to do.	Jgħid lil kulħadd x'għandu jagħmel.
I really couldn’t do this without help.	Verament ma stajtx nagħmel dan mingħajr għajnuna.
A better man.	Raġel aħjar.
I saw what he was doing.	Rajt x’kien qed jagħmel.
I suspect I never did	Nissuspetta li qatt ma għamilt
I probably was	I probabbilment kien
He wants to, you know.	Irid, taf.
I just can't do that	I biss ma nistax nagħmel dan
Now I can see.	Issa nista' nara.
He wasn’t expecting this.	Ma kienx qed jistenna dan.
He would not want to know.	Ma jkunx irid ikun jaf.
Not now, not ever.	Mhux issa, mhux qatt.
Ridt.	Ridt.
I can see that you're thinking	Nista’ nara li qed taħseb
I was afraid of many things	Kont nibża’ minn ħafna affarijiet
Someone was out there.	Xi ħadd kien hemm barra.
I shouldn’t be here.	M'għandix inkun hawn.
I went with him.	Jien mort miegħu.
I can't be afraid of that	Ma nistax nibża minn hekk
But it never happened.	Imma qatt ma sar.
We were together, we needed each other.	Konna flimkien, kellna bżonn lil xulxin.
Only once again.	Għal darba oħra biss.
Maybe he thought it was his.	Forsi ħaseb li kien tiegħu.
I know you talk to him.	Naf li titkellem miegħu.
I want everyone to see this.	Irrid li kulħadd jara dan.
This works.	Dan jaħdem.
We can’t do more.	Ma nistgħux nagħmlu aktar.
I’ve been doing pretty well here	Jien stajt nagħmel pjuttost tajjeb hawn
They have money.	Għandhom flus.
It's not really a big deal.	Mhuwiex verament ħaġa kbira.
I can’t have everyone do what they want	Ma nistax ikolli lil kulħadd jagħmel dak li jrid
He couldn't wait until she did.	Ma setax jistenna sakemm hi għamlet.
I did it for you too	Għamilt għalik ukoll
This is much better.	Dan huwa ħafna aħjar.
But he wanted to.	Imma ried.
But everything was better than good.	Imma kollox kien aħjar milli tajjeb.
I would like to be here friend	Nixtieq inkun hawn ħabib
And if they were late.	U kieku kienu tard.
He lost everything.	Huwa tilef kollox.
It would not be easy.	Ma tkunx ħaġa faċli.
I know why he did that.	Naf għaliex għamel hekk.
I believe you had one yesterday as well	Nemmen li kellek waħda lbieraħ ukoll
You will be fine.	Int tkun tajjeb.
I think it will do well	Naħseb li se tagħmel tajjeb
I wonder what he was doing back here	Nistaqsi x’kien qed jagħmel lura hawn
I have never seen it that way.	Qatt ma rajt hekk.
I didn’t need to know	Ma kellix għalfejn inkun naf
Apparently she had a lot.	Milli jidher kellha ħafna.
You should see.	Għandek tara.
I'm going to need some help.	Jien ser ikolli bżonn xi għajnuna.
And another thing.	U ħaġa oħra.
I am first and foremost your friend	Jien l-ewwel u qabel kollox ħabib tiegħek
It’s too late for that now.	Huwa tard wisq għal dak issa.
You could be on to something.	Inti tista 'tkun fuq xi ħaġa.
I was doing it for him.	Kont qed nagħmel għalih.
A lot of time actually	Ħafna ħin fil-fatt
But everything is not what it seems.	Imma kollox mhux dak li jidher.
That's the way it should be with everyone.	Hekk irid ikun ma’ kulħadd.
Probably me.	Probabbilment jien.
But only a few.	Imma ftit biss.
There is everything there is.	Hemm dak kollu li hemm.
That could have been really bad.	Dak seta’ kien tassew ħażin.
He was tired, but he was more than that.	Kien għajjien, imma kien aktar minn hekk.
He still lives here, in fact.	Għadu jgħix hawn, fil-fatt.
I think he talks about the truth	Naħseb li jitkellem dwar il-verità
I’m not saying anything more	Jien ma ngħid xejn aktar
I already wanted to go home	Diġà ridt immur id-dar
If not, don't.	Jekk le, m'għandekx.
More than you should.	Aktar milli suppost.
Not yet, but soon.	Għadu mhux, imma dalwaqt.
You will do that.	Int ser tagħmel dan.
Try me wrong.	Ipprova lili ħażin.
We know better.	Nafu aħjar.
I needed to go	Kelli bżonn li mmur
I always knew what was going on, what was going to happen	Dejjem kont naf x’ġara, x’kien se jiġri
We are like everyone else.	Aħna bħal kulħadd.
I just wanted to know	Ridt biss inkun naf
I have something you want	Għandi xi ħaġa li trid
Now it really is.	Issa huwa verament.
I shouldn’t have come back for you	Ma kellix ġejt lura għalik
You can’t see how, but it’s done.	Ma tistax tara kif, imma qed isir.
He wasn't sure exactly where.	Ma kienx ċert eżatt fejn.
I was out with him when it happened	Jien kont barra miegħu meta ġara
I thought he wanted to take his things and leave	Ħsibt li ried jieħu l-affarijiet tiegħu u jitlaq
I think it should have been	Naħseb li kellha tkun
It was late.	Kien tard.
I was really going to buy that	Kont verament se nixtri dak
He said, you can only do what you can do.	Huwa qal, inti tista 'biss tagħmel dak li tista' tagħmel.
Maybe some other time.	Forsi xi żmien ieħor.
It takes a long time.	Huwa jieħu żmien twil.
I can't do anything wrong	Ma nista nagħmel xejn ħażin
He would be all we need.	Huwa jkun dak kollu li għandna bżonn.
I’m sure he did.	Jien ċert li għamel.
I saw and heard everything	Rajt u smajt kollox
As I was, well.	Kif kont, ukoll.
I would like to talk to you	Nixtieq nitkellem miegħek
I'll be going soon	Jien ser immur dalwaqt
I needed to know where he was	Kelli bżonn inkun naf fejn kien
I'll try to do a little	Jien ser nipprova nagħmel ftit
He didn't want to think about it.	Ma riedx jaħseb dwarha.
It will be great.	Se jkun kbir.
Surely you know something.	Żgur li taf xi ħaġa.
But it was.	Imma kien.
I like it.	Jien inħobb.
He really did.	Huwa tassew għamel.
I have to talk.	Għandi nitkellem.
And looked at.	U ħares lejn.
I couldn't understand where or why	Ma stajtx nifhem fejn jew għaliex
I just wanted to, back, these are mine now	Ridt biss, lura, dawn huma tiegħi issa
I never thought that would happen	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jiġri hekk
But she had a husband.	Imma kellha raġel.
That's what you need.	Dak hu li għandek bżonn.
And everyone was happy.	U kulħadd kien kuntent.
I just moved	Għadni kemm mort
It still is.	Għadu hekk.
But nothing seemed a problem.	Imma xejn ma deher problema.
I wasn’t even home.	Jien lanqas biss kont id-dar.
That has never happened to me before.	Dak qatt ma ġara miegħi qabel.
I’m so glad you came home	Jien ferħan ħafna li ġejt id-dar
I will be doing it myself.	Se nkun qed nagħmel jien.
We already knew everything.	Diġà konna nafu kollox.
He didn't know how it was, but he did.	Kif jista’ jkun dan ma kienx jaf, imma kien.
He still doesn't know what it looks like.	Għadu ma jafx kif tidher.
and I'm not going yet.	u għadni mhux sejjer.
Whatever happened.	X'kien li ġara.
And on you go.	U fuq inti tmur.
I don't know what to say	ma nafx x'se ngħid
I couldn’t believe this was actually happening	Ma stajtx nemmen li dan kien qed jiġri fil-fatt
He knew better than anyone.	Kien ikun jaf aħjar minn ħafna.
Of course I can and will.	Żgur li nista’ u se.
It's very bad.	Huwa ħażin ħafna.
I thought about it often.	Ħsibt dwarha spiss.
please.	jekk jogħġbok.
It is very easy to do.	Huwa faċli ħafna li tagħmel.
I knew exactly where we were	Kont naf eżatt fejn konna
Here are a few.	Hawn huma ftit.
It couldn't be too late.	Ma setax ikun tard wisq.
I don’t have to try to understand.	M'għandix għalfejn nipprova nifhem.
I can't talk to anyone about this	Ma nista’ nitkellem ma’ ħadd dwar dan
It just seems too hard and too much work.	Jidher biss wisq diffiċli u wisq xogħol.
It was the first time she had thought that.	Kienet l-ewwel darba li ħaseb hekk.
I don’t want to know anything	Ma rridx inkun naf xi ħaġa
I can be your friend	Jien nista' nkun ħabib tiegħek
It had been a while.	Kien ilu għal xi żmien.
I am yours now and forever	Jiena tiegħek issa u għal dejjem
I don’t want anyone to think so	Jien ma nixtieq li ħadd jaħseb hekk
I can do everything for everyone.	Kapaċi nagħmel kollox għal kulħadd.
What came out was not a good idea.	Dak li ħareġ ma kienx idea tajba.
And everything else.	U kull ħaġa oħra.
One thing at a time.	Ħaġa waħda kull darba.
When she.	Meta hi.
I want it to be good	Irrid li jkun tajjeb
And not only that.	U mhux hekk biss.
I almost didn’t want to believe what he was saying	Kważi ma ridtx nemmen dak li kien qed jgħid
I can't imagine who it might be	Ma nistax naħseb min jista' jkun
I thought she did a really great job.	Ħsibt li għamlet xogħol tassew kbir.
I love everything about it	Inħobb kollox dwarha
He is not.	Hu mhux.
I couldn’t see much, but it was enough	Ma stajtx nara ħafna, imma kien biżżejjed
I was no more than that	Jien ma kontx aktar minn hekk
I didn’t want to talk about it	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwarha
I think he’s trying	Naħseb li qed jipprova
I think.	Naħseb .
She is a big boy.	Hija tifel kbir.
They are doing it.	Huma qed jagħmlu dan.
And my son.	U tifel tiegħi.
Or for a car.	Jew għal karozza.
Everything will be fine.	Kollox se jkun tajjeb.
I can say that everyone did their best	Nista’ ngħid li kulħadd għamel minn kollox
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwarha.
I thought I was going to do the same	Ħsibt li kont se tagħmel l-istess
But this could not happen.	Imma dan ma setax jiġri.
Maybe now was the time.	Forsi issa kien iż-żmien.
What works for me, works for me.	Dak li jaħdem għalija, jaħdem għalija.
Home is not for him.	Id-dar mhix għalih.
I was the only one who knew he was coming	Jien kont l-uniku wieħed li kien jaf li kien ġej
I believe you think it was me	Nemmen li taħseb li kont jien
But maybe you can do more.	Imma forsi tista’ tagħmel aktar.
I knew better than that	Kont naf aħjar minn hekk
I never did that	Qatt ma għamilt hekk
Or I thought she did.	Jew ħsibt li għamlet.
It seems to work.	Jidher li jaħdem.
I was a little worried about it	Kont xi ftit inkwetat dwarha
He was not ready.	Ma kienx lest.
I’m not going to do anything about it.	Jien mhu se nagħmel xejn dwarha.
This is probably not what you want.	Dan probabbilment mhuwiex dak li trid.
This is mine.	Din hi tiegħi.
And soon enough, there is.	U malajr biżżejjed, hemm.
Not a bit.	Mhux daqsxejn.
So it always is.	Hekk hu dejjem.
It just wasn’t.	Biss ma kienx.
I have never heard of this before.	Qatt ma smajt b'dan qabel.
There he is, you see.	Hemm hu qiegħed, tara.
It was just one or the other.	Kien biss wieħed jew ieħor.
We needed help.	Kellna bżonn l-għajnuna.
I'm really happy	Jien kuntent ħafna tassew
There is no way you can do that.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li tista 'għamilt dan.
I think a lot is good to say.	Naħseb li ħafna huwa tajjeb li ngħid.
He is trying to win.	Qed jipprova jirbaħ.
You still don't know anything.	Għadek ma taf xejn.
I’m not saying anything back	Jien ma ngħid xejn lura
About something, really.	Dwar xi ħaġa, tassew.
I can’t do this alone	Ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi
I'll be me	Jien ser inkun jien
There was nothing wrong.	Ma kien hemm xejn ħażin.
But we never will.	Imma aħna qatt ma se.
I was glad he wasn’t going	Kont ferħan li ma kienx sejjer
He should not have one.	M'għandux ikollu wieħed.
I haven't been here in a long time	Ma stajtx ilni hawn
It is now.	Huwa issa.
He is right.	Huwa għandu raġun.
I have to wait	Ikolli nistenna
It's with me.	Huwa miegħi.
I don't see anything.	Jien ma nara xejn.
It was a bad idea.	Kienet idea ħażina.
Everyone knew what was coming when they saw me.	Kulħadd kien jaf x’kien ġej meta ra lili.
That says something, actually.	Li tgħid xi ħaġa, fil-fatt.
I didn’t think it was going to be a problem	Ma kontx naħseb li se tkun problema
I can be a teacher	Nista’ nkun għalliem
Something really is wrong.	Xi ħaġa verament hija ħażina.
I didn’t look at anything else	Jien ma ħares lejn xi ħaġa oħra
That works well.	Li jaħdem tajjeb.
He enjoys eating.	Huwa jieħu gost jiekol.
Really, just a little bit.	Tassew, ftit ftit.
Good thing.	Ħaġa tajba.
I never knew why.	Qatt ma kont naf għaliex.
But do nothing.	Imma ma tagħmel xejn.
Now they have to.	Issa għandhom.
Who knows what will happen.	Min jaf x'se jiġri.
Not with you.	Mhux miegħek.
There's a man there.	Hemm raġel hemm.
I never tell anyone.	Qatt ma ngħid lil ħadd.
It may never happen.	Jista’ qatt ma jiġri.
Nothing happens ahead of time.	Xejn ma jiġri qabel iż-żmien.
It looks good now.	Jidher tajjeb issa.
It’s not me to say.	Mhux jien li ngħid.
Not everyone can do that.	Mhux kulħadd jista’ jagħmel dan.
I was trying not to think about it	Kont qed nipprova ma naħsibx dwarha
I didn't think it would happen	Ma kontx naħseb li jista’ jiġri
I couldn't see what he was doing	Ma stajtx nara x’kien qed jagħmel
He plans to leave soon.	Qed jippjana li jitlaq dalwaqt.
I haven’t thought much about it lately	Ma tantx ħsibt dwar dan dan l-aħħar
She did everything wrong.	Hija għamlet kollox ħażin.
There must be more than that.	Għandu jkun hemm aktar minn hekk.
I didn’t even think to do that.	Lanqas ma ħsibt li tagħmel dan.
I still don't know.	Għadni ma nafx.
It goes on.	Imur fuq.
That was him.	Dak kien hu.
Maybe it never will.	Forsi qatt ma se.
I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong.	M'inix ċert x'qed nagħmel ħażin.
I can talk to him about something	Kapaċi nitkellem dwar xi ħaġa miegħu
The truth is he didn’t know for sure.	Il-verità hi li ma kienx jaf żgur.
I want you to take this	Irrid li tieħu dan
Very bad, very bad.	Ħażin ħafna, ħażin ħafna.
I can do the same!	Nista' nagħmel l-istess!
You know you can do that.	Taf li tista’ tagħmel dan.
In fact, he should eat something.	Fil-fatt, għandu jiekol xi ħaġa.
I want to go back to school	Irrid immur lura l-iskola
I’m trying to understand why or how.	Qed nipprova nifhem għaliex jew kif.
But we know more.	Imma nafu aktar.
Everyone was just people.	Kulħadd kien biss nies.
He arrives.	Huwa jasal.
It wasn’t easy either.	Lanqas ma kien faċli.
This is about this book.	Dan huwa dwar dan il-ktieb.
Nor did he make his own.	U lanqas ma kien jagħmel tiegħu.
What you know, you know.	Dak li taf, taf.
He wasted no time.	Kien tilef il-ħin.
I was soon ready to go home	Dalwaqt kont lest biex immur id-dar
I never thought about it	Qatt ma kont naħseb dwar dan
I’ll tell you when the time comes	Jien ngħidlek meta jasal iż-żmien
But he is a boy.	Imma hu tifel.
But it was good.	Imma kien tajjeb.
He knew he would come for all this time.	Kien jaf li se jasal għal dan il-ħin kollu.
Mine not so bad.	Tiegħi mhux daqshekk ħażin.
But we never do.	Imma qatt ma nagħmlu.
But he says he won't.	Imma jgħid li mhux se jiġi.
You know how to be alone.	Inti taf kif tkun waħdek.
I had to know this was going to happen	I kellha naf li dan se jiġri
I did a little for you.	Għamilt xi ftit għalik.
Work to be done.	Xogħol li jrid isir.
I wasn't sure who it was	Ma kontx ċert min kien
I knew he would be there	Kont naf kieku kien hemm
I have no idea why he thinks so	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex jaħseb hekk
Now, she knew why.	Issa, kienet taf għaliex.
What will happen? 	X'se jiġri?
It was just that.	Kien biss dan.
My time passed.	Il-ħin tiegħi għadda.
I didn’t even think about it.	Jien lanqas biss ħsibt dwarha.
She doesn't know.	Hija ma tkunx taf.
I want him to come back	Irrid li jiġi lura
And yours too.	U tiegħek ukoll.
I definitely hope so.	Jien żgur nittama li hekk.
I had never seen anything like it	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa bħal din
Much or nothing is wrong.	Ħafna jew xejn huwa ħażin.
If you wanted.	Jekk ridt.
I think she is someone everyone should know.	Naħseb li hija xi ħadd li kulħadd għandu jkun jaf.
It seems possible.	Jidher li jista 'jkun.
I can’t believe she was doing that to me	Ma nistax nemmen li kienet tagħmel hekk miegħi
And it was very good.	U kien tajjeb ħafna.
I will make you happy, you can do anything.	Se nagħmel inti kuntent, inti tista 'tagħmel kull ħaġa.
Not so, today.	Mhux hekk, illum.
It just seemed to work.	Biss deher li jaħdem.
Not one.	Mhux wieħed.
She is really nice to me.	Hija tassew sabiħa għalija.
I want to talk a little with you.	Irrid nitkellem ftit miegħek.
That is, you think.	Dan hu, taħseb.
I was glad to hear that	Kont kuntent li smajt dan
Very very much.	Ħafna ħafna.
I didn’t even know why	Jien lanqas biss kont naf għaliex
I was willing to do anything	Kont lest li nagħmel xejn
I wish this had happened a long time ago	Nixtieq li dan ġara żmien twil ilu
Nothing to do is ever easy.	Xejn ta’ min jagħmel qatt ma jiġi faċli.
That's long enough.	Dak huwa twil biżżejjed.
There’s probably another person out there as well.	Probabbilment hemm persuna oħra hemmhekk ukoll.
I thought I was happy	Ħsibt li kien kuntent
I couldn't understand why	Ma stajtx nifhem għaliex
It was me and not me.	Jien kont jien u mhux jien.
I'm afraid he won't be the only one	Nibża li mhux se jkun l-uniku wieħed
More than I ever thought possible.	Aktar milli qatt kont ħsibt.
I had to see myself	Kelli nara jien
Don’t make a lot of money fast.	M'għandekx tagħmel ħafna flus malajr.
It's about more than money.	Huwa dwar aktar minn flus.
I need some help here.	Għandi bżonn xi għajnuna hawn.
This was his home.	Din kienet id-dar tiegħu.
This is all a bit.	Dan kollu huwa daqsxejn.
I knew it was better than that	Kont naf li kienet aħjar minn hekk
I didn’t even think about it	Lanqas ma ħsibt dwarha
I had never been.	Qatt ma kelli ġejt.
And for so little back.	U għal daqshekk ftit lura.
I just wanted to know where she was	Ridt biss inkun naf fejn kienet
Much more than a year ago.	Ħafna aktar minn sena ilu.
Nor does it seem to work.	Lanqas jidher li jaħdem.
We'll do our own.	Aħna ser nagħmlu tagħna.
He just felt tired.	Huwa biss ħassu għajjien.
Now faster.	Issa aktar malajr.
He knows where you are.	Jaf fejn int.
I think I’m sorry for that	Naħseb li jiddispjaċini għalija
It may not be.	Jista 'ma jkunx.
I just want to leave	Nixtieq biss li jitlaq
I understand everyone very well	Nifhem tassew tajjeb ma’ kulħadd
I can’t do better than that	Ma nistax nagħmel aħjar minn hekk
I wasn’t even sure why	Lanqas kont ċert għaliex
I couldn’t even think of anything else	Lanqas stajt naħseb fuq xi ħaġa oħra
I did nothing wrong	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin
But that’s not really it.	Imma dak mhuwiex verament.
And so it would be.	U hekk ikun.
I still am, of course	Jien għadni, ovvjament
I was really, really beautiful	Jien kont tassew, tassew sabiħa
He could tell she knew it wouldn't happen.	Huwa seta 'jgħid li kienet taf li mhux se jiġri.
I'm going home.	Jien sejjer id-dar.
And he’s not trying to do what you do.	U hu mhux qed jipprova jagħmel dak li tagħmel int.
I think that’s what he wants.	Naħseb li dak hu li jrid.
I know what you are thinking.	Naf x'qed taħseb.
I wish I was here	Nixtieq li kont hawn
They are people too.	Huma nies ukoll.
I know better than that so far	Għandi naf aħjar minn dan sa issa
It was always good.	Dejjem kien tajjeb.
I had someone who did all this stuff	Kelli xi ħadd li għamel dan l-affarijiet kollha
He was a beautiful person too.	Kien persuna sabiħa wisq.
It was late, and he was tired.	Kien tard, u kien għajjien.
He didn't tell me.	Hu ma qalli.
I can't be.	Ma nistax inkun.
No one did that anymore.	Ħadd ma għamel hekk aktar.
I just need a little more time	Għandi bżonn biss ftit aktar ħin
And we know what is right and wrong.	U nafu x'inhu tajjeb u ħażin.
I can go home	Nista’ mmur id-dar
I’m also young.	Jien ukoll għadni żgħir.
That’s what she did.	Huwa dak li għamlet.
I’m not sure how you can do that.	M'inix ċert kif tista' tagħmel dan.
It should not.	M'għandux.
It doesn’t look like that now.	Ma jidhirx hekk issa.
He didn’t tell me anything.	Ma qalli xejn.
All of them have.	Kollha kemm huma għandhom.
I couldn't even see anything	Lanqas stajt nara xejn
I think he was doing the same	Naħseb li kien qed jagħmel l-istess
He died in the afternoon.	Miet wara nofsinhar.
But do something more.	Imma tagħmel xi ħaġa aktar.
You look tired.	Inti tidher għajjien.
There was little time.	Kien hemm ftit ħin.
That was a good idea.	Din kienet idea tajba.
Not only did he want to, he needed to.	Mhux biss ridt, kellu bżonn.
We have to go.	Irridu mmorru.
Nor was she there.	Lanqas ma kienet hemm.
You know how it is.	Inti taf kif dan.
So be it.	Hekk ikun.
She never does.	Hija qatt ma tagħmel.
I wanted what he wanted	Jien ridt dak li ried hu
To do this, you need work.	Biex tagħmel dan, għandek bżonn xogħol.
He was not going to say anything.	Ma kien se jgħid xejn.
There is no way to know.	M'hemm l-ebda mod biex tkun taf.
He didn’t tell me anything.	Ma qalli xejn.
Wherever possible.	Kull fejn jista’ jkun.
You want to stay where you are.	Trid toqgħod fejn int.
They were there last night.	Kienu hemm ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
Please do not do this.	Jekk jogħġbok tagħmilx dan.
Now he won't.	Issa hu mhux se.
Boy, can you.	Tifel, jista’.
We are the same people.	Aħna l-istess nies.
I don't even know what that is	Lanqas inkun naf x’inhu dak
Nothing really happened there.	Tassew ma ġara xejn hemmhekk.
But definitely not everything.	Imma żgur mhux kollox.
Definitely not just one thing.	Żgur li mhix ħaġa waħda biss.
That would be.	Li jkun.
I had no problem with that.	Ma kelli l-ebda problema b'dan.
All are easy to make.	Kollha huma faċli biex jagħmlu.
Unless it's just me.	Sakemm ma jkunx jien biss.
I have no idea where, or if, they are	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn, jew jekk, huma
Probably not a good thing.	Probabbilment mhux ħaġa tajba.
I know a little about first aid	Naf ftit dwar l-ewwel għajnuna
The car was right.	Il-karozza kellha raġun.
I can understand where it came from.	Kapaċi nifhem minn fejn kien ġej.
Maybe more than that.	Forsi aktar minn hekk.
No more my friends, no more.	Mhux aktar ħbieb tiegħi, mhux aktar.
I knew that at the time	Jien kont naf li dak iż-żmien
After so long.	Wara tant żmien twil.
I’ve done enough of this on my own	Jien għamilt biżżejjed minn dan waħdi
I will not be back	Jien mhux se nkun lura
I can't believe you	Ma nistax nemmen li int
I didn’t even have much time to think about it.	Lanqas ma kelli ħafna ħin biex naħseb dwarha.
I did well.	Għamilt tajjeb.
Well, and maybe something else.	Ukoll, u forsi ħaġa oħra.
Definitely not there yet.	Żgur li għadni mhux hemm.
Now I can’t even be your friend.	Issa ma nistax inkun lanqas ħabib tiegħek.
He had seen something.	Huwa kien ra xi ħaġa.
I have everything that was supposed to be mine	Ikolli dak kollu li kellu jkun tiegħi
You time everything.	Inti ħin kollox.
Now you have friends.	Issa għandek ħbieb.
Well, better than maybe.	Ukoll, aħjar minn forsi.
And so it was.	U hekk kien.
He had done what he had to do.	Huwa kien għamel dak li kellu jagħmel.
I would have heard of her if she had	Kont smajt dwarha kieku kellu
He looked good, he thought.	Huwa deher tajjeb, ħaseb.
It can't be that way.	Ma jistax ikun hekk.
I can’t believe I did that	Ma nistax nemmen li għamilt dan
It really happened.	Tassew ġara.
I never knew about it	Qatt ma kont naf dwar dan
Nothing was done, really.	Ma sar xejn, tassew.
I didn’t need any help for this	Ma kelli bżonn l-ebda għajnuna għal dan
I couldn’t take more than that now	Ma stajtx nieħu aktar minn dan issa
Certainly not always so.	Żgur li mhux dejjem kien hekk.
But we had to.	Imma kellna.
I was telling you that	Jien kont ngħidlek hekk
I knew what was coming next	Kont naf x’kien ġej wara
That could happen tomorrow.	Li jista’ jiġri għada.
Not done.	Mhux sar.
I might as well try again	Nista 'ukoll nipprova mill-ġdid
I have no idea where the time went.	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn mar il-ħin.
I didn’t think anything else about it	Ma ħsibt xejn ieħor dwarha
I have no idea whether it was or not.	M'għandi l-ebda idea jekk kienx jew le.
It may look good.	Jista 'jidher tajjeb.
Just an idea.	Biss idea.
I thought I saw it that way	Ħsibt li rajt hekk
Everything was one.	Kollox kien wieħed.
He was happy to do so.	Kien kuntent li jagħmel hekk.
But then not now.	Imma dak iż-żmien mhux issa.
Everything was out.	Kollox kien barra.
I have no idea	M'għandi l-ebda idea
That’s no time at all, that’s nothing.	Dak mhu żmien xejn, dak mhu xejn.
I want to have.	Irrid għandi.
As it were.	Kif kien.
It never passed quickly.	Qatt ma għadda malajr.
I could do without it.	Jien stajt nagħmel mingħajr dan.
But he will.	Imma hu se.
Now he was alone.	Issa kien waħdu.
I said no, no more.	Għidt, le, mhux aktar.
I understand why you say so.	Nifhem għaliex tgħid hekk.
How to speak.	Kif titkellem.
It can only work.	Jista 'biss jaħdem.
I always thought it was just me	Dejjem ħsibt li kont jien biss
I’ve always been happy, always	Jien dejjem kont inkun kuntent, dejjem
I was so young when it all happened	Kont tant żgħir meta ġara kollox
Surely he wanted to.	Żgur li kien ried hekk.
I want to say what happened.	Irrid ngħid x'ġara.
You can do whatever you want.	Tista 'tagħmel dak kollu li trid.
I must be the only one	I għandu jkun l-uniku wieħed
I know this is hard for you	Naf li dan huwa diffiċli għalik
I can see this now.	Nista' nara dan issa.
I stay with him.	Jien noqgħod miegħu.
I’ve seen that.	Jien stajt nara dak.
I’m very sorry, but that’s what needs to be done now.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna, imma dak li jrid isir issa.
I can't believe this	Ma nistax nemmen dan
I never wanted anything more.	Qatt ma ridt xejn aktar.
None of these things.	Xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet.
I’ve never been able to get enough of this	Qatt ma stajt nieħu biżżejjed minn dan
I think it will be beautiful	Naħseb li se tkun sabiħa
It's his.	Huwa tiegħu.
Do your job.	Jagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħek.
It's a little late to think about it.	Huwa ftit tard biex taħseb dwar dan.
I don’t know if he knew that.	Ma nafx jekk kienx jaf dan.
I'm still the same	Għadni l-istess jien
I didn’t.	Jien ma kontx.
He is a man now.	Huwa raġel issa.
They are just a little for a while.	Huma ftit biss għal ftit żmien.
I can't take it anymore	Ma nistax nieħu aktar
I can’t do that anymore.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan aktar.
That was out.	Dak kien barra.
He could not speak.	Ma setax jitkellem.
But that’s not all we do.	Imma mhux dak kollu li nagħmlu.
I could see he was home.	Stajt nara li kien id-dar.
I can tell you that here	Nista 'ngħidlek li hawn
And so she did.	U hekk għamlet hi.
I have no help, nothing	M'għandi l-ebda għajnuna, xejn
He will be fine, of course.	Huwa se jkun tajjeb, ovvjament.
How much no one knows.	Kemm ħadd ma jaf.
It was not the same.	Ma kienx l-istess.
I want more than that	Irrid aktar minn dan
For the past few years.	Għal dawn l-aħħar ftit snin.
Look back at the front door.	Ħares lura lejn il-bieb ta’ barra.
I had a really good time here.	Kelli ħin tassew tajjeb hawn.
Hard to say how many there were.	Diffiċli ngħid kemm kien hemm.
So he told me, more than once.	Hekk qalli, aktar minn darba.
Maybe it should be so.	Forsi għandu jkun hekk.
Which it wasn’t.	Li ma kienx.
It is working from now on.	Qed jaħdem minn issa.
Enough, enough, enough already.	Biżżejjed, biżżejjed, biżżejjed diġà.
Nothing the same now.	Xejn l-istess issa.
I was thinking and I think, it’s here.	Jien kont qed naħseb u naħseb, qiegħed hawn.
It really was.	Kien tassew.
But we did.	Imma għamilna.
I find it a little easy	Jiena noqgħod ftit faċli
I did a lot of bad things	Għamilt ħafna affarijiet ħażin
But that’s me.	Imma dan jien.
I didn’t know what to say next	Ma kontx naf x'se ngħid wara
Well, maybe it's hard to say no.	Ukoll, forsi huwa diffiċli biex jgħid le.
Just enough, there was.	Ftit biżżejjed, kien hemm.
Now that has happened.	Issa dak ġara.
Not so bad.	Mhuwiex daqshekk ħażin.
I’m talking to anyone who sees this	Qed nitkellem lil kull min jara dan
I was, I thought.	Kont inkun, ħaseb.
No one can really help.	Ħadd ma jista 'verament jgħin.
We are friends forever.	Aħna ħbieb għal dejjem.
They were so before.	Kienu hekk qabel.
He had time for everyone.	Kellu ħin għal kulħadd.
I’ve always been good at getting the job done	Jien dejjem kont tajjeb biex nagħmel ix-xogħol
I really need some help.	Verament għandi bżonn xi għajnuna.
It was never me.	Qatt ma kont jien.
He has to.	Huwa għandu.
She really did a good job	Hi tassew għamlet xogħol tajjeb
He was right about the time.	Kellu raġun dwar il-ħin.
I believe that can happen.	Nemmen li jista’ jiġri.
How everyone is doing the same thing	Kif kulħadd qed jagħmel l-istess ħaġa
Don't be so.	Tkunx hekk.
It has always been so for me.	Dejjem kien hekk għalija.
No one knew where he was going.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn imur.
I can’t wait to hear this.	Ma nistax nistenna biex nisma dan.
I don’t want to go back, he said.	Ma rridx immur lura, qal.
This will not help.	Dan mhux se jgħin.
I really have no idea why she does this	Verament m'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex hi tagħmel dan
I had never done this before.	Qatt ma kont għamilt dan qabel.
And it still does.	U għadu jagħmel.
He had not done so for a long time.	Kien ilu ma għamel hekk.
And if you do.	U jekk tagħmel dan.
I know what's wrong with him	Naf x’hemm ħażin miegħu
Never really.	Qatt ma verament.
I have to tell the truth, he thought	Ikolli ngħid il-verità, ħaseb
But it won't.	Imma mhux se.
It was not easy to be with him	Ma kontx faċli li nkun miegħu
I think about it	Naħseb dwar dan
I never did that.	Qatt ma għamilt hekk.
He had been doing so for a long time.	Kien ilu jagħmel hekk.
It’s time to do the same.	Wasal iż-żmien li nagħmlu l-istess.
But not for long.	Imma mhux għal żmien twil.
A lot of things you don’t do.	Ħafna affarijiet li ma tagħmilx.
I didn’t want to know.	Ma ridtx tkun taf.
It was after that.	Kien wara dak.
I think he can do that	Naħseb li jista 'jagħmel dan
No, not a few.	Le, mhux ftit.
I was pretty scared for a while	I kien pjuttost jibża 'għal ftit żmien
I would never say that	Jien qatt ma ngħid hekk
It's so small.	Huwa daqshekk żgħir.
He always knew what he was wearing	Dejjem kien jaf x’kien liebes
I will definitely be back	Żgur li se nkun lura
Not the only one.	Mhux l-uniku wieħed.
I had been doing it for years	Kont għamilt snin
It's not as bad as it sounds.	Mhuwiex ħażin daqs kemm jidher.
I couldn't go.	Ma stajtx immur.
I have to make some money.	Ikolli nagħmel xi flus.
Hours and hours.	Sigħat u sigħat.
That was me.	Dak kont jien.
I used to do that	Jien kont nagħmel hekk
That’s the only thing you know how to do.	Dik hija l-unika ħaġa li taf kif tagħmel.
I have to believe, but	Irrid nemmen, imma
I still didn’t want to believe it	Għadni ma ridtx nemmen
You can't be.	Inti ma tistax tkun.
But we knew he knew he needed to.	Imma nafu li kien jaf li kellu bżonn.
I just want to know why	Irrid inkun naf biss għaliex
He does not speak.	Hu mhux jitkellem.
He left.	Huwa telaq.
And it was beautiful.	U kienet sabiħa.
I need to talk to him	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħu
It’s the only way to do that.	Huwa l-uniku mod kif tagħmel dan.
Maybe he’s just good.	Forsi hu biss tajjeb.
I'm not interested in talking to you	M'iniex interessat li nitkellem miegħek
He was still a child, but he was not yet a child.	Kien għadu tifel, imma ma kienx għadu tifel.
He knows this may be his last chance.	Jaf li dan jista’ jkun l-aħħar ċans tiegħu.
I can understand.	Kapaċi nifhem.
It's big enough.	Huwa kbir biżżejjed.
I don’t want to have to do this again.	Ma rridx ikolli nagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
A little but not too much	Ftit imma mhux wisq
I know what you're thinking	Naf li dak li qed taħseb
I may be late tonight	Jista’ nkun tard illejla
I did what anyone would do	Jien għamilt dak li kien jagħmel xi ħadd
I will do whatever you want.	Jien se nagħmel dak kollu li tixtieq.
I wanted you here for that	Jien ridt inti hawn għal dak
That's what I do.	Dak hu nagħmel.
You had nothing.	Ma kellek xejn.
This goes really fast.	Dan imur tassew malajr.
It is a work in progress.	Huwa xogħol li qed isir.
But he told me, no.	Imma qalli, le.
But he never came home.	Imma qatt ma ġie d-dar.
I want to see more than before.	Irrid nara aktar minn qabel.
I think you can say a lot.	Naħseb li tista’ tgħid ħafna minn hekk.
I think we are both tired	Naħseb li aħna t-tnejn għajjien
I want to do this with him	Irrid nagħmel dan miegħu
I think you are ready	Naħseb li inti lest
A friend told me about it.	Ħabib qalli dwar dan.
But that can't be right.	Imma dan ma jistax ikun tajjeb.
This is not the first time.	Din mhix l-ewwel darba.
I was so glad I came home	Kont tant ferħan li ġejt id-dar
You have no idea.	M'għandekx idea.
I will try again today	Se nerġa' nipprova llum
I went to school.	Kont l-iskola.
I was able to be a child	Kont kapaċi nkun tifel
There is no other way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor.
He started for the door.	Beda lejn il-bieb.
I almost wish it was	Kważi nixtieq li kien
I wasn’t expecting anything more !.	Jien ma kont nistenna xejn aktar!.
I think that and more	Naħseb li u aktar minn hekk
Not many people either	Lanqas ħafna nies
I have one and so it was	Ikolli wieħed u hekk kien
I want to do it again.	Irrid nerġa' nagħmel.
You don't make that much money.	Inti ma tagħmel daqshekk flus.
I can’t believe he was worried	Ma nistax nemmen li kien inkwetat
He wanted nothing.	Ma ried xejn.
Why it's not working.	Għaliex mhux qed jaħdem.
I couldn’t really understand why	Ma stajtx verament nifhem għaliex
I hope so	Nittama li jista’ jkun hemm
I can't do it for you	Ma nistax nagħmel għalik
In addition, it will be good.	Barra minn hekk, se jkun tajjeb.
I know something is wrong with him	Naf li xi ħaġa hija ħażina miegħu
I need that for me.	Għandi bżonn li għalija.
But good.	Imma tajjeb.
It could be you.	Jista 'jkun int.
Well, not yet.	Ukoll, għadu mhux.
I can’t believe it’s happening to me	Ma nistax nemmen li qed jiġri lili
I can't tell you how we know	Ma nistax ngħidlek kif nafu
I wanted to say that for a long time	Jien ridt ngħid hekk għal żmien twil
I do what you should be doing	Nagħmel dak li għandek tkun qed tagħmel
I wasn’t sure if I had been	Ma kontx ċert jekk kontx ġejt
I wasn’t trying, please, no	Ma kontx nipprova, jekk jogħġbok, le
But now it’s time to stand alone.	Imma issa wasal iż-żmien li noqgħod waħdi.
I said he was right with me.	Għidt li kien tajjeb miegħi.
I saw and, most of all, heard	Rajt u, fuq kollox, smajt
I’m a little worried about it.	Jien xi ftit inkwetat dwarha.
But not at all.	Imma mhux għal kollox.
We were always together.	Konna dejjem flimkien.
Obviously it was really great.	Ovvjament kien tassew kbir.
One time, we did.	Darba waħda, għamilna.
This is a good thing	Din hija ħaġa tajba
I want you to know.	Irrid li tkun taf.
I knew he would have	Kont naf li kien ikollu
I never do anything myself	Jien qatt ma nagħmel xejn jien
And he can do it right here	U jista 'jagħmel dan eżatt hawn
I never thought this would happen	Qatt ma ħsibt li dan jista’ jiġri
No one else left either.	Ħadd ieħor ma telaq lanqas.
If you knew, you can’t do that.	Kieku taf, ma tistax tagħmel dan.
I have to think.	Jien għandi naħseb.
I never thought it would happen	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jiġri
Definitely here and there.	Żgur hawn u hemm.
I know such things	Naf affarijiet bħal dawn
But she never did.	Imma qatt ma għamlet.
It shouldn’t have been there.	Ma kellux ikun hemm.
I know more things.	Naf aktar affarijiet.
I think these are a good idea	Naħseb li dawn huma idea tajba
There must be.	Għandu jkun hemm.
Not that there was much to see.	Mhux li kien hemm ħafna x'tara.
This works just fine.	Dan jaħdem eżatt kif suppost.
She knew where she was.	Kienet taf fejn kienet.
I know you can do something	Naf li tista’ tagħmel xi ħaġa
You did a great job here.	Int għamilt xogħol kbir hawn.
She did nothing more.	Hija ma għamlet xejn aktar.
Now he was tired.	Issa kien għajjien.
He had gone home.	Huwa kien mar id-dar.
I'm not with anyone.	Jien ma’ ħadd.
But no more.	Imma mhux aktar minn hekk.
I want some time alone with you	Irrid ftit ħin waħdi miegħek
I wanted to be like that.	Jien ridt inkun hekk.
It shouldn’t, and it isn’t.	M'għandux, u mhuwiex.
I'm sure it will be	Jien ċert li se jkun
Surely he could have done better.	Żgur li seta’ jagħmel aħjar.
He will do it.	Huwa se jagħmel dan.
We really were.	Konna tassew.
I couldn’t sit down.	Ma stajtx noqgħod bilqiegħda.
I am very happy for him and for you	Jien kuntent ħafna għalih u għalik
We know he is a good person.	Nafu li hu persuna tajba.
Which in fact it is not.	Li fil-fatt mhuwiex.
That is enough for me.	Dan huwa biżżejjed għalija.
I had to go with him.	Kelli mmur miegħu.
I don't think you can do anything about it.	Ma naħsibx li tista’ tagħmel xi ħaġa.
You have me.	Għandek lili.
She wants a man.	Hija trid raġel.
He could play forever	Seta’ jilgħab għal dejjem
I don’t like this job.	Ma nħobbx dan ix-xogħol.
I say no.	Jien ngħid li mhux.
This was not proper.	Dan ma kienx kif suppost.
But all that was not really so.	Imma dak kollu ma kienx verament hekk.
No, you certainly are not.	Le, żgur li m’intix.
There may be nothing there.	Jista 'jkun hemm xejn hemmhekk.
You don’t want that.	Ma tridx li.
I didn’t need that.	Jien ma kellix bżonn dak.
I want to know where it came from	Irrid inkun naf minn fejn ġie
This is what they do.	Dan huwa dak li jagħmlu.
It is often here.	Huwa spiss hawn.
He is doing well.	Qed jagħmel tajjeb.
Everyone can look good.	Kulħadd jista' jidher tajjeb.
I just want this to go	Irrid biss li dan imur
I try not to.	Nipprova ma.
I wasn’t trying to be late	Ma kontx nipprova nkun tard
I couldn't say that	Ma stajtx ngħid hekk
Something like that.	Xi ħaġa bħal dik.
fi.	fi.
I couldn't be more afraid.	Ma stajtx nibża' aktar minn hekk.
I think.	Naħseb.
I wasn’t ready and she knew that	Jien ma kontx lest u hi kienet taf li
I didn’t know for how long.	Ma kontx naf għal kemm żmien.
I'm happy for you.	Jien kuntent għalik.
This is what has happened lately.	Dan hu dak li ġara dan l-aħħar.
It was only yesterday, after all.	Kien ilbieraħ biss, wara kollox.
It must have been there some years ago.	Għandu jkun hemm xi snin ilu.
Now it has begun.	Issa beda.
I just want to know what's going on	Irrid inkun naf biss x’inhu jiġri
I was not surprised at all	Ma kont sorpriż xejn
I did nothing.	Jien ma għamilt xejn.
I was doing whatever it took	Jien kont nagħmel dak kollu li hemm bżonn
Not good, but better.	Mhux tajjeb, imma aħjar.
But that was before I went back.	Imma dan kien qabel ma mort lura.
I'm ready for everything	Jien lest għal kollox
We can only do so much.	Nistgħu nagħmlu biss daqshekk.
After that, it doesn’t.	Wara dan, ma jagħmilx hekk.
I was here alone	Jien kont hawn waħdi
It’s been out for a good while.	Ilu barra għal żmien tajjeb.
And stay there.	U joqgħod hemm.
There are so many.	Hemm tant.
And more besides.	U aktar barra minn hekk.
And not much more.	U mhux ħafna aktar.
I wasn’t watching	Jien ma kontx qed nara
That's one thing.	Dik l-istess ħaġa waħda.
I have to say a little more about that, maybe	Għandi ngħid ftit aktar dwar dan, forsi
Just not here.	Biss mhux hawn.
I thought someone would go with me	Ħsibt li jmur xi ħadd miegħi
I don’t even try.	Lanqas nipprova.
That was a few years back.	Dan kien ftit snin lura.
I know very well.	Naf tajjeb ħafna.
It should look like this.	Għandu jidher bħal dan.
That was really good.	Dak kien tassew tajjeb.
All of them.	Kollha kemm huma.
He said he hopes to come.	Qal li jittama li jiġi.
I know you were doing your job	Naf li kont qed tagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħek
I can't think of it	Ma nistax naħseb dwarha
I really wasn't sure	Verament ma kontx ċert
A man will be sitting outside.	Raġel se jkun bilqiegħda barra.
Too much time.	Wisq ħin.
It was really beautiful.	Kienet tassew sabiħa.
He doesn't know how to do it.	Ma jafx kif jagħmel.
There is no way he is living that way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li qed jgħix minn hekk.
I want the same thing	Irrid l-istess ħaġa
It’s not about something good.	Mhix dwar xi ħaġa tajba.
You never knew.	Int qatt ma kont taf.
I think he is.	Naħseb li hu.
Well, maybe she is.	Ukoll, forsi hi.
He had never done this before.	Hu qatt ma kien għamel dan qabel.
I said you can do whatever you want	Għidt li tista’ tagħmel dak kollu li trid
But she had it all.	Imma kellha kollox.
I see you know these two.	Nara li taf dawn it-tnejn.
That time has now come.	Dak iż-żmien issa wasal.
I know that's not all	Naf li dan mhux kollox
I can't do everything for you	Ma nistax nagħmel kollox għalik
This was very bad.	Dan kien ħażin ħafna.
I really like this one too.	Jien inħobb ħafna din ukoll.
I thought that was it	Ħsibt li kien dak
That was really so.	Dak kien tassew hekk.
It is the only time it will be so bad.	Hija l-unika darba li se jkun daqshekk ħażin.
No one came out.	Ħadd ma ħareġ barra.
I knew where he was going	Kont naf fejn kien sejjer
He wasn’t doing very well.	Ma tantx kien qed jagħmel tajjeb.
I’m afraid it’s getting too late for him	Nibża li qed isir tard wisq għalih
I don’t think he is.	Ma naħsibx li hu.
I don't know exactly.	Ma nafx eżatt.
I see you know something.	Nara li taf xi ħaġa.
I’m glad to be here.	Jien kuntent li nkun hawn.
It would not have been the last.	Ma kienx ikun l-aħħar.
It needs to be.	Jeħtieġ li jkun.
It wasn’t working so well.	Ma kienx qed jaħdem daqshekk tajjeb.
I'll talk to you later	Nitkellem miegħek aktar tard
I really needed someone to talk to	Kelli bżonn ħafna lil xi ħadd biex nitkellem
He is already back.	Huwa diġà lura.
He had never seen it coming.	Hu qatt ma kien ra li ġej.
And it never will be.	U qatt mhu se jkun.
Anyone can say anything.	Kulħadd jista’ jgħid xi ħaġa.
Now he had no one, nothing.	Issa ma kellu lil ħadd, xejn.
There is something very wrong.	Hemm xi ħaġa ħażina ħafna.
I want to know if this is done	Irrid inkun naf li dan isir
And we don't know each other very well.	U ma tantx nafu lil xulxin.
But it will be back tonight.	Imma se jerġa’ jkun hemm illejla.
I don't want to be here	Ma rridx inkun hawn
It will be the same.	Se jkun l-istess.
Let’s go there.	Ejja mmorru hemmhekk.
And the time has come.	U wasal iż-żmien.
I have seen and heard enough	Rajt u smajt biżżejjed
Talk and talk and talk.	Jitkellem u jitkellem u jitkellem.
I didn’t have much to say about it	Ma kellix ħafna xi ngħid dwar dan
It was too early	Kien kmieni wisq
You are right, in fact.	Għandek raġun, fil-fatt.
I know it will do well	Naf li se tagħmel tajjeb
But you can't.	Imma ma tistax.
I don't know who he is.	Ma nafx min hu.
He passed me by.	Huwa għadda lili.
I heard it was really good but hard.	Smajt li kien tassew tajjeb imma diffiċli.
It really is.	Huwa verament.
I had a lot of work for him	Kelli ħafna xogħol għalih
It takes more than that.	Jieħu aktar minn hekk.
I just want to be.	Nixtieq inkun biss.
You are really beautiful.	Int tassew sabiħa.
It was too much.	Kien wisq.
I can’t wait to buy it again	Ma nistax nistenna li nixtri mill-ġdid
And here's another one.	U hawn ieħor.
He never did and never will.	Qatt ma għamel u qatt ma se.
That was the truth.	Dik kienet il-verità.
It may be the last thing he does.	Jista’ jkun l-aħħar ħaġa li qatt jagħmel.
I was scared.	Kont nibża.
I'm not yet.	Jien għadni mhux.
We want to know.	Irridu nkunu nafu.
It never really started	Qatt ma beda verament
If anyone knew, they would.	Kieku xi ħadd kien jaf, kieku.
And so it was.	U hekk kien.
I had that happen often.	Kelli li jiġri spiss.
I know you do almost everything for him	Naf li inti tagħmel kważi kollox għalih
I wonder what it was	Nistaqsi x’kien
This is for me.	Din hija għalija.
There is nothing for you out there.	M'hemm xejn għalik hemmhekk.
Not many people are.	Mhux ħafna nies huma.
Or did something else.	Jew għamel xi ħaġa oħra.
I want to see my house	Irrid nara d-dar tiegħi
I don’t think about it	Ma naħsibx dwarha
There is no one here to see.	M'hemm ħadd hawn biex jara.
I really need your help	Għandi verament bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek
He wanted one.	Ried wieħed.
Maybe a little too fast.	Forsi ftit wisq malajr.
I think it will be good after a while	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb wara ftit żmien
I want to tell you about something	Irrid ngħidlek dwar xi ħaġa
It wasn’t enough.	Ma kienx biżżejjed.
I doubt it.	Niddubita dan.
He would be very happy.	Ikun kuntent ħafna.
I just hope no one comes along	Nispera biss li ħadd ma jiġi flimkien
It’s really so bad.	Huwa verament daqshekk ħażin.
It doesn’t.	Ma jagħmilx hekk.
Well, now.	Ukoll, issa.
That was too much.	Dan kien wisq.
Worth a try.	Ta’ min jipprova.
I wanted to know what was going on there	Ridt inkun naf x’qed jiġri hemmhekk
This doesn’t help anyone.	Dan ma jgħin lil ħadd.
I was great that I had everyone back there together.	Kont kbir li kelli lil kulħadd lura hemmhekk flimkien.
I understand very well.	Nifhem tajjeb ħafna.
I go back to the car	Immur lura lejn il-karozza
Everyone was still busy.	Kulħadd kien għadu okkupat.
I needed to know what he was saying	Kelli bżonn inkun naf x’kien qed jgħid
I just want the truth	Irrid biss il-verità
I couldn’t believe it when he told me.	Ma stajtx nemmen meta qalli.
I’ve been able to do that.	Jien stajt nagħmel hekk.
I didn’t know she was here.	Ma kontx naf li kienet hawn.
And it was really bad.	U kien tassew ħażin.
I knew where he lived	Kont naf fejn jgħix
We had enough money.	Kellna biżżejjed flus.
She was out.	Kienet barra.
I had to say something better	I kellha għid xi ħaġa aħjar
I never thought it would happen.	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jiġri.
It was all mine.	Kien kollox tiegħi.
I can’t believe it happened	Ma nistax nemmen li ġara
But what he wanted was someone he didn’t want.	Imma dak li ried kien xi ħadd li ma riedx.
Come back here.	Ejja lura hawn.
It was better.	Kien aħjar.
.	.
Look everything is going well.	Ħares kollox sejjer tajjeb.
I can’t believe he did this for me	Ma nistax nemmen li għamel dan għalija
No one knew anything.	Ħadd ma kien jaf xejn.
I wasn’t going to go	Jien ma kontx se mmur
I was late and will hear about it	Kont tard u se nisma’ dwarha
You really don’t have to.	Tassew m'għandekx.
I didn’t know there was so much	Ma kontx naf li kien hemm tant
I can hardly believe it	Kważi ma nistax nemmen
I didn't want to see it	Ma ridtx nara
That's not the case.	Dak mhux hekk.
And it shouldn’t be.	U m'għandux ikun.
I have something behind that	Għandi xi ħaġa wara dan
And that was still difficult.	U dan kien għadu diffiċli.
He said that could be the problem.	Qal li din tista’ tkun il-problema.
It just never happened.	Huwa biss qatt ma ġara.
I can understand everyone	Kapaċi nifhem lil kulħadd
Maybe they are.	Forsi huma.
I have no idea, man, he said	M'għandi l-ebda idea, raġel, qal
I need to talk to him.	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħu.
It’s not who we are.	Mhuwiex min aħna.
Anyone and everyone you can think of.	Kulħadd u kulħadd li inti tista 'taħseb.
I saw a friend, who works there	Rajt ħabib, li jaħdem hemm
As big as he is, he never could.	Kbir kemm hu, qatt ma seta’.
I never go there.	Jien qatt ma mmur hemm.
But he seems to be doing it.	Imma jidher li qed tagħmel dan.
But not currently.	Imma mhux bħalissa.
He had to think a little.	Kellu jaħseb ftit.
I have no idea why you wouldn't be	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex inti ma tkunx
To know that he can do something.	Biex tkun taf li jista’ jagħmel xi ħaġa.
I didn’t know it was going to go that far	Ma kontx naf li se jmur daqshekk
I hope the same for you.	Nittama li l-istess għalik.
I was in school, of course.	Jien kont l-iskola, ovvjament.
I know better than that	Naf aħjar minn hekk
Not all the time, of course.	Mhux il-ħin kollu, ovvjament.
But you know who they are.	Imma taf min huma.
I was never worried about anything like that	Qatt ma kont inkwetat dwar xi ħaġa minn hekk
I was going to, only now	Kont se, issa biss
I did almost nothing	Kważi ma għamilt xejn
I didn’t expect this to be the case	Ma kontx nistenna li dan ikun hekk
Everything is going well for a while.	Kollox imur tajjeb għal xi żmien.
Sure enough, he did.	Żgur biżżejjed, huwa għamel.
I knew it couldn’t be done	Kont naf li ma setax isir
I'm not going home.	Jien mhux se mmur id-dar.
I have to listen tomorrow	Għandi nisma' għada
I had no idea why this was happening	Ma kelli l-ebda idea dwar għaliex kien qed jiġri dan
It just happened.	Ġara biss.
Often it is not.	Ħafna drabi ma jkunx.
I had to do the same thing	Kelli nagħmel l-istess ħaġa
Nothing to see here either.	Xejn x'tara hawn lanqas.
He finished and started.	Huwa lest u beda.
But he went.	Imma huwa mar.
And this is a problem.	U din hija problema.
I was there when it happened.	Jien kont hemm meta ġara.
She must have been.	Hija trid kienet.
You should be above.	Għandek tkun hawn fuq.
But why should that be.	Imma għaliex għandu jkun dan.
Sorry, but so.	Jiddispjaċini, imma hekk.
I’m surprised it started at all, really.	Jien sorpriż li beda xejn, tassew.
I am very happy for him.	Jien kuntent ħafna għalih.
It would be wrong.	Ikun ħażin.
Come with us.	Ejja magħna.
I have with me.	Ikolli miegħi.
I didn’t think it was good enough.	Ma kontx naħseb li kien tajjeb biżżejjed.
I was really good	Kont verament tajjeb
That is enough.	Dan huwa biżżejjed.
It was nobody.	Ma kienet ħadd.
You have no idea what that is.	M'għandekx idea x'inhu dak.
Is that so ?.	Huwa hekk?.
I was the first and only child	Jien kont l-ewwel u l-uniku tifel
I didn’t want to think about it anymore	Ma ridtx naħseb aktar
Both are better than what you have now.	It-tnejn huma aħjar minn dak li għandek issa.
It was early but sure.	Kien kmieni imma żgur.
I think you do well.	Naħseb li tagħmel tajjeb.
But she had none.	Imma ma kellha l-ebda.
Account.	Kont.
I didn’t want him to take everything	Ma ridtx li hu jieħu kollox
Maybe that helps.	Forsi dan jgħin.
I had no idea.	Ma kellix idea.
I need to tell someone, just once.	Għandi bżonn ngħid lil xi ħadd, darba biss.
The same year.	L-istess sena.
I believe we really are much more than that	Nemmen li aħna verament ħafna aktar minn hekk
The time alone was great.	Il-ħin waħdi kien kbir.
No one can stay here for very long.	Ħadd ma jista’ jibqa’ hawn għal żmien twil ħafna.
I think almost everyone came around.	Naħseb li kulħadd kważi daħal madwar.
I don't think so.	Ma naħsibx.
I didn’t have time to do anything.	Ma kellix ħin biex nagħmel xejn.
He seemed to be working.	Deher li kien qed jaħdem.
Time until now.	Żmien sa issa.
Sitting and talking and thinking was not enough.	Li tkun bilqiegħda u titkellem u taħseb ma kienx biżżejjed.
I wanted to be with him forever	Ridt inkun miegħu għal dejjem
I'm glad he was here.	Jien kuntent li kien hawn.
I can't do anything about it	Ma nista nagħmel xejn dwar dan
We can't do that.	Dan ma nistgħux nagħmlu.
I was alone, doing nothing	Jien kont waħdi, ma nagħmel xejn
I also thought she was a boy	Jien ukoll ħsibt li kienet tifel
I know what that is now	Naf x'inhu dak issa
That's what they do.	Dak hu li jagħmlu.
I love everything you do	Inħobb dak kollu li tagħmel
They were already there with him.	Kienu diġà hemm miegħu.
I have some work to do.	Għandi xi xogħol.
I think all this can wait until the morning	Naħseb li dan kollu jista’ jistenna sa filgħodu
I couldn’t talk about anything	Ma stajt nitkellem dwar xejn
We need to get there as soon as possible.	Irridu mmorru kemm jista’ jkun malajr.
u.	u.
Say things, maybe.	Tgħid affarijiet, forsi.
That was it.	Kien dak.
I had never seen anything like it before	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa bħal din qabel
That's why.	Dan għaliex.
First I wanted to talk to you.	L-ewwel ridt nitkellem miegħek.
I didn’t really know anything about it	Ma kont naf xejn dwarha tassew
It would have been around pretty much.	Kien ikun madwar pjuttost ħafna.
I don't expect anything.	ma nistenna xejn.
It looked bad.	Deher ħażin.
Nothing you can do with me.	Xejn li tista tagħmel miegħi.
I definitely think they need some time	Żgur naħseb li għandhom bżonn ftit ħin
I had never seen anything like it	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa bħal din
That's how they felt.	Hekk ħassu.
Not each other, no more.	Mhux xulxin, mhux aktar.
There was also.	Kien hemm ukoll.
I wanted everything else.	Ridt kull ħaġa oħra.
I didn’t know I was there	Ma kontx naf li kont hemm
You think you are.	Taħseb li int.
But not more than enough.	Imma mhux aktar minn biżżejjed.
Everyone is happy, but no one is happy.	Kulħadd huwa kuntent, imma ħadd ma hu kuntent.
I won’t be here much longer	Mhux se nkun hawn ħafna aktar
I was just so scared	I kien biss tant jibża
You know what we do.	Taf li nagħmlu.
I’m not what you say	Jien mhux dak li tgħid
I can't do that now	Ma nistax nagħmel dan issa
I didn't say anything	Jien ma għedt xejn
We’ve been doing it lately.	Dan l-aħħar konna qed nagħmlu.
My work was finished.	Ix-xogħol tiegħi kien lest.
I can't tell you what we're doing here	Ma nistax ngħidlek x'qed nagħmlu hawn
I had no one to talk to	Ma kellix min nitkellem
Quite this.	Pjuttost dan.
He will stay again.	Se jerġa 'jibqa'.
I knew this was not going to be easy.	Kont naf li dan mhux se jkun faċli.
I thought there was only one.	Ħsibt li kien hemm wieħed biss.
I will say this only once	Jien se ngħid dan darba biss
It was bad then and bad now.	Kien ħażin dak iż-żmien u ħażin issa.
And on and on it goes.	U fuq u fuq din tmur.
This happened after hours.	Dan ġara wara sigħat.
He can't have.	Ma jistax ikollu.
Everyone was at work.	Kulħadd kien fuq ix-xogħol.
I will do it again	Se nerġa' nagħmel
I wish he would never come back	Nixtieq li qatt ma jiġi lura
For you too.	Għalik ukoll.
I just want to see	Irrid nara biss
And you came with me.	U ġejt miegħi.
I don’t want anything back.	Ma rrid xejn lura.
I thought a lot about it	Ħsibt ħafna dwarha
He must have passed out.	Huwa għandu jkun għadda barra.
It probably wouldn't even be good.	Probabbilment lanqas biss ikun tajjeb.
I couldn’t do this once	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan darba waħda
Every idea is a good idea.	Kull idea hija idea tajba.
It looks bad.	Jidher ħażin.
You know that so.	Inti taf li hekk.
So we did.	Hekk għamilna.
There is one more thing to say.	Hemm ħaġa oħra li jrid jgħid.
He was just playing with us	Kien għadu kif jilgħab magħna
But there is much more.	Imma hemm ħafna aktar.
Well, maybe not.	Ukoll, forsi le.
I’m just saying this isn’t a nice thing.	Jien ngħid biss li din mhix ħaġa sabiħa.
Not you and me.	Le int u jien.
But it won’t do, either.	Imma dan mhux se jagħmel, lanqas.
And so great.	U daqshekk kbir.
I can't stand here and talk anymore	Ma nistax noqgħod hawn u nitkellem aktar
I didn’t want anything to happen	Ma ridtx li jiġri xejn
He was living like before.	Kien qed jgħix bħal qabel.
For that one.	Għal dak wieħed.
No one can be seen.	Ħadd ma jista 'jidher.
I'm ready.	Jien lest.
I’ll see what’s more ready for me	Jiena nara x'hemm aktar lest għalija
For a time, for a time we do.	Għal żmien, għal żmien nagħmlu.
And she will do well	U hi se tagħmel tajjeb
All that can ever be.	Dak kollu jista’ jkun qatt.
I would never go back	Jien qatt ma kont immur lura
I can't do anything here	Ma nista nagħmel xejn hawn
I just hope it seems.	Nittama biss li jidher.
It won’t be for long.	Mhux se jkun għal żmien twil.
About almost everything.	Dwar kważi kollox.
I said it was good	Għidt li kien tajjeb
No, you are right.	Le, għandek raġun.
And whatever happens happens.	U jiġri dak li jiġri.
I hope there will be work for you.	Nistenna li se jkun hemm xogħol għalik.
I know this is not easy for you either.	Naf li dan mhux faċli għalik lanqas.
I’m still sure of that.	Għadni ċert minn dan.
But of course it would be, you were small.	Imma ovvjament ikun, inti kont żgħir.
But maybe you don’t.	Imma forsi ma tagħmilx.
How beautiful she was.	Kemm kienet sabiħa.
Sorry, a lot	Jiddispjaċini li, ħafna
He couldn’t prove it, but he was sure.	Ma setax jipprova dan, imma kien ċert.
Maybe he actually thought he did.	Forsi fil-fatt ħaseb li għamel.
That was mine.	Dak li kien tiegħi.
I did what no one thought I could, or would do.	Għamilt dak li ħadd ma ħaseb li tista’, jew kieku.
Who was it.	Min kien hekk.
I love a man who can work	Jien inħobb raġel li jista' jaħdem
I think that’s all, so far	Naħseb li kollox, sa issa
I couldn’t think of it	Ma stajtx naħseb dwarha
I can’t think why not.	Ma nistax naħseb għaliex le.
The school was only a few years old.	L-iskola kellha biss ftit snin.
I know everyone.	Naf lil kulħadd.
I’m trying so hard.	Qed nipprova tant.
I had never seen anything more beautiful	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa aktar sabiħa
I'm still.	Jien għadni.
But maybe.	Imma forsi.
I see she was right	Nara li kellha raġun
It would have been there.	Kien ikun hemm.
But none of this happened.	Imma xejn minn dan ma ġara.
It wasn’t good enough.	Ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed.
I didn't even see who he was	Lanqas rajt min kien
Everyone should know this.	Kulħadd għandu jkun jaf dan.
I just couldn’t.	Jien biss ma stajtx.
I tell everyone about it	Ngħid lil kulħadd dwarha
But it didn’t have to be him.	Imma ma kellux ikun hu.
In fact, a lot happens.	Fil-fatt, jiġri ħafna.
she says.	hi tgħid.
I never want to.	Jien qatt ma nixtieq.
Things are early.	L-affarijiet huma kmieni.
Well, not only that.	Ukoll, mhux hekk biss.
This early in the morning.	Dan kmieni filgħodu.
I didn't know what was going to happen.	Ma kontx naf x’kien se jiġri.
That was a pretty good thing.	Li kienet xi ħaġa pjuttost tajba.
I said it would be good.	Għidt li jkun tajjeb.
You must be you.	Trid tkun int.
Not even a single person.	Lanqas xi persuna waħda.
I wasn’t sure what was going on anymore	Ma kontx ċert x'qed jiġri aktar
I wanted to see everything	Ridt nara kollox
Not just the door.	Mhux biss il-bieb.
I can’t believe no one wants to buy this	Ma nistax nemmen li ħadd ma jrid jixtri dan
I hope this makes things better for you	Nittama li dan jagħmel l-affarijiet aħjar għalik
That was good too.	Dan kien tajjeb wisq.
I had been alone long before that	Kont ilni waħdi ħafna qabel dan
She did the same thing.	Hija għamlet l-istess ħaġa.
There may not be many or there may be many.	Jista 'ma jkunx hemm ħafna jew jista' jkun hemm ħafna.
Now I can talk about that.	Issa nista’ nitkellem dwar dan.
It looks so good.	Jidher hekk tajjeb.
I had done nothing	Jien ma kont għamilt xejn
I still can’t believe she’s really here	Għadni ma nistax nemmen li hi tassew hawn
I didn't know who you were	Ma kontx naf min int
Let me try again.	Ħa nipprova mill-ġdid.
I know you want more	Naf li trid aktar
I couldn’t think fast enough.	Ma stajtx naħseb malajr biżżejjed.
Or maybe it seemed so.	Jew forsi deher hekk.
We want to do better.	Irridu nagħmlu aħjar.
I hope you can as well	Nispera li inti tista 'kif hekk
I won't be late either	Lanqas se nkun tard
Maybe that’s where we should go next.	Forsi hemm fejn għandna mmorru wara.
That’s a beautiful thing.	Dik hija ħaġa sabiħa.
And of.	U ta’.
I hope tomorrow is good	Nispera li għada jkun tajjeb
I'll try something else	Nipprova xi ħaġa oħra
I didn’t really think about it	Ma tantx ħsibt dwarha
I could go either way on this one.	I tista 'tmur jew mod fuq dan wieħed.
I’ve done better maybe	Jien stajt għamilt aħjar forsi
I had no idea he lived here	Ma kellix idea li kien jgħix hawn
I can’t believe you’re here.	Ma nistax nemmen li int hawn.
I can’t think about it.	Ma nistax naħseb dwar dan.
He may want to go, 'he said.	Jista’ jkun li jrid imur,’ qal.
And we were sitting here.	U konna bilqiegħda hawn.
I need to know what happened	Għandi bżonn inkun naf x’ġara
I'm not sure you're a boy	M'inix ċert li int tifel
I just thought you could	Ħsibt biss li tista'
And many are.	U ħafna huma.
And maybe it was.	U forsi kien.
If they ever do.	Jekk qatt jagħmlu.
I didn't know who you were	Ma kontx naf min int
It seemed what was happening now.	Kien jidher dak li kien qed jiġri issa.
Lots of fun.	Ħafna gost.
He never had a chance.	Hu qatt ma kellu ċans.
He did it pretty well.	Huwa għamel dan pjuttost tajjeb.
I would like to know.	Nixtieq inkun naf.
It's not happening right now.	Mhux qed jiġri bħalissa.
I have no idea why this is happening	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex dan qed jiġri
I wanted to be there	Ridt inkun hemm
I wasn’t sure how long.	Ma kontx ċert għal kemm żmien.
I always thought I was too good for myself	Dejjem ħsibt li kont tajjeb wisq għalija
This is difficult for me.	Dan huwa diffiċli għalija.
You are mine and mine alone.	Int tiegħi u tiegħi biss.
Now we can be friends	Issa nistgħu nkunu ħbieb
It's just some people sitting there.	Huwa biss xi nies bilqiegħda hemm.
Not so with you.	Mhux hekk miegħek.
This is taking too long.	Dan qed jieħu wisq żmien.
I was hoping to talk to you about it	Kont nittama li titkellem miegħek dwarha
I still won’t believe it	Għadni mhux se nemmen
I just moved here earlier today	Għadni kemm mort hawn aktar kmieni llum
I knew what he wanted	Kont naf xi ried
I like to buy things for you	Inħobb nixtri affarijiet għalik
I think maybe you should go home	Naħseb li forsi għandek tmur id-dar
There is really nothing much to say.	M'hemm xejn verament ħafna xi ngħid.
It doesn't have to be that way.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
You’re not saying it would but who knows.	Mhux qed tgħid li kieku imma min jaf.
I wasn’t trying to do that	Jien ma kontx nipprova nagħmel hekk
I knew it all this time	Jien kont naf dan il-ħin kollu
Not so with this one.	Mhux hekk ma 'dan wieħed.
And other things.	U affarijiet oħra.
I never did that.	Qatt ma għamilt hekk.
I couldn’t wait any longer	Ma stajtx nistenna aktar
I can’t wait to try.	Ma nistax nistenna li nipprova.
This will work.	Dan se jaħdem.
I knew he could wait	Kont naf li jista’ jistenna
I didn’t want to say so.	Ma ridtx ngħid hekk.
But he couldn't.	Imma ma setax.
I think now you have what you wanted	Naħseb li issa għandek dak li ridt
It wasn't.	Ma kienx.
I was ready to see what else was out there	Kont lest biex nara x'hemm ieħor barra
I haven’t thought much about it lately.	Ma tantx ħsibt dwar dan dan l-aħħar.
But that was not what happened.	Imma dan ma kienx dak li ġara.
He still does.	Għadu jagħmel.
Or we can go around outside.	Jew nistgħu mmorru madwar barra.
To know things you may not know.	Li tkun taf affarijiet li ma tistax tkun taf.
He certainly won't.	Huwa żgur li mhux se.
I was out.	Kont barra.
And really, it’s not too hard.	U tassew, mhuwiex wisq diffiċli.
She was not thinking anything.	Ma kienet taħseb xejn.
He is going with you.	Huwa sejjer miegħek.
But this is not working now.	Imma dan mhux qed jaħdem issa.
I hear almost everything	Nisma’ kważi kollox
I wasn’t worried about it	Ma kontx inkwetat dwarha
Sorry for that.	Jiddispjaċini għal dan.
But it wasn't his.	Imma ma kienx tiegħu.
It seems easier that way.	Jidher aktar faċli hekk.
I haven't done that in a long time	Ilni ma nagħmel dan
Just me, not there, for me	Jien biss, mhux hemm, għalija
Until.	Sakemm.
I am doing so, of course.	Qed nagħmel hekk, ovvjament.
And so it should be.	U hekk għandu jkun.
Everything seems to be working fine.	Kollox jidher li qed jaħdem tajjeb.
I'm sure you will be able to think of something for me.	Jien ċert li inti tkun kapaċi taħseb xi ħaġa għalija.
So would everyone.	Hekk kieku kulħadd.
I only know who.	Naf biss min.
He doesn’t even know you.	Hu lanqas jaf int.
What we are.	Dak li aħna.
Many hours.	Ħafna sigħat.
There was no more, of course.	Ma kienx hemm aktar, ovvjament.
We have no idea this is going to happen.	M'għandniex idea li dan se jiġri.
He died a few hours later.	Miet ftit sigħat wara.
I speak for him.	Jien nitkellem għalih.
There was a good boy for you.	Kien hemm tifel tajjeb għalik.
I shouldn’t have done that.	Jien ma kellix għamilt hekk.
If it came out.	Jekk ħareġ.
I just need to eat.	Għandi bżonn biss niekol.
I didn't even go to school	Lanqas kont immur l-iskola
I didn’t either	Lanqas jien ma kellix
But so is he.	Imma hekk hu.
I am what you want	Jiena li trid
He never did.	Hu qatt ma għamel.
It will be hard, but it will be glad, too.	Se jkun diffiċli, imma se jkun ferħan, ukoll.
You were always there.	Int dejjem kont hemm.
I know they were here	Naf li kienu hawn
But if you had.	Imma kieku kellek.
There really was no money.	Verament ma kienx hemm flus.
He should be fine.	Huwa għandu jkun tajjeb.
I need something you know	Għandi bżonn xi ħaġa li taf
He was one man.	Kien raġel wieħed.
You just are.	Int biss int.
I didn’t want to talk anymore.	Ma ridtx nitkellem aktar.
It seems so long ago now.	Jidher li tant ilu issa.
You just do.	Inti biss tagħmel.
It never happened and it will never happen.	Qatt ma ġara u qatt mhu se jiġri.
There is nothing more	M'hemm xejn aktar
I'm happy.	Jien kuntent.
This time only.	Din darba biss.
It couldn’t have been otherwise.	Ma setax kien mod ieħor.
There must be.	Għandu jkun hemm.
I was ready to sit down.	Kont lest biex noqgħod bilqiegħda.
I did nothing	Jien ma għamilt xejn
Now he was doing it.	Issa kien jagħmel dan.
I’ve been here for just over a year	Kont hawn għal ftit aktar minn sena
I know you're here.	Naf li int hawn.
Tonight I was tired too, after this week	Illejla kont għajjien ukoll, wara din il-ġimgħa
I did these for him.	Għamilt dawn għalih.
I just think you should know that	Naħseb biss li għandek tkun taf li
He came to me.	Huwa wasal lili.
I didn't know what to do next	Ma kontx naf x’se jagħmel wara
This was none of that.	Dan ma kien xejn minn hekk.
She had a good time.	Hija kellha ħin tajjeb.
I couldn’t go back home, I still haven’t	Ma stajtx immur lura d-dar, għadni mhux
Difficult.	Diffiċli.
You know how.	Taf kif.
And she’s here to stay.	U hi hawn biex toqgħod.
I knew this was going to happen someday	Kont naf li dan kien se jiġi xi darba
I will definitely be back	Żgur se nkun lura
I didn’t want anything	Jien ma ridt xejn
No, mine.	Le, tiegħi.
I can’t tell you for sure if it was.	Ma nistax ngħidlek żgur jekk kienx.
He could wait.	Seta’ jistenna.
You weren’t here.	Int ma kontx hawn.
Someone has to say something.	Xi ħadd irid jgħid xi ħaġa.
You can be sure of that.	Inti tista 'tkun ċert minn dan.
How.	Kif.
We are not so.	Aħna mhux hekk.
There seemed to be a lot of problems.	Deher li kien hemm ħafna problemi.
I can’t believe this is it	Ma nistax nemmen li dan hu
You can never do enough.	Qatt ma tista’ tagħmel biżżejjed.
I'm not surprised at all.	Jien ma sorpriż xejn.
I can't do anything.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn.
I’m very happy about that.	Jien ferħan ħafna dwar dan.
He wants his truth back.	Irid il-verità tiegħu lura.
This was better than he could have hoped.	Dan kien aħjar milli seta’ jittama.
Today I saw and heard both.	Illum rajt u smajt it-tnejn.
It was good to know.	Kien tajjeb li tkun taf.
I would love to hear about it	Nixtieq nisma dwarha
But not too late.	Imma mhux tard wisq.
It should always be so	Dejjem għandu jkun hemm hekk
Be he.	Ikun hu.
He’s not the only one.	Hu mhux l-uniku wieħed.
And they should.	U għandhom.
Now there.	Issa hemm.
He took none.	Ma ħa l-ebda.
I can't buy that	Ma nistax nixtri dak
That can wait.	Li jista 'jistenna.
He was trying something.	Kien jipprova xi ħaġa.
It was never just about that.	Qatt ma kien biss dwar dan.
And so it happened.	U hekk ġara.
He is from this school.	Huwa minn din l-iskola.
I know that now.	Naf li issa.
I can say that something was wrong	Nista 'ngħid li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina
Well, it can.	Ukoll, jista '.
I had too much to understand	Kelli wisq biex nifhem
I was right, this was wrong.	Kelli raġun, dan kien ħażin.
I think that’s a good thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba.
It will not work.	Mhux se jaħdem.
And so he did here.	U hekk għamel hawn.
I want to know what's right for me	Irrid nifhem x’inhu tajjeb għalija
I wasn’t taking a chance	Ma kont qed nieħu ċans
This happens to me.	Dan jiġri lili.
He said there was no time.	Qal li ma kienx hemm ħin.
I never thought I would do something like that	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik
At the time I didn’t know.	Dak iż-żmien ma kontx naf.
I'm really sorry.	Jien tassew jiddispjaċini.
They are back and better than ever.	Huma lura u aħjar minn qatt qabel.
I have no idea how well this works	M'għandi l-ebda idea kemm dan jaħdem tajjeb
I would probably say no.	Probabbilment ngħid le.
I just think you should take some time	Naħseb biss li għandek tieħu ftit ħin
I just do.	Jien biss nagħmel.
You weren’t there, of course.	Int ma kontx hemm, ovvjament.
I was there.	Jien kont hemm.
Does anyone else have this problem ?.	Xi ħadd ieħor għandu din il-problema?.
I have someone too	Jien ukoll għandi xi ħadd
It had been there for some time.	Kien ilu hemm xi żmien.
It can work.	Jista' jaħdem.
Not bad either.	Mhux ħażin lanqas.
She wants to.	Hija trid.
It’s like everything else.	Huwa bħal kull ħaġa oħra.
I couldn’t believe it was him.	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien hu.
I didn’t have much of a chance without help	Ma kellix wisq ċans mingħajr għajnuna
I was hoping to talk to you	Kont nittama li nitkellem miegħek
I needed to sit down and talk	Kelli bżonn noqgħod bilqiegħda u nitkellem
It takes one.	Huwa jieħu wieħed.
She was right, of course.	Hija kellha raġun, ovvjament.
I had never been there before.	Qatt ma kont hemm qabel.
I will try to do the same.	Se nipprova nagħmel l-istess.
I have no idea how to do that	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif jagħmel dan
Time to go.	Ħin biex tmur.
But no.	Imma le.
I know who you really are	Naf min int verament
I had to know and understand	Kelli nkun naf u nifhem
I mean, enough is enough	Jien ngħid, biżżejjed huwa biżżejjed
All of them.	Kollha kemm huma.
Obviously they should.	Ovvjament għandhom.
Everything else works well.	Kollox ieħor jaħdem tajjeb.
I wish it shouldn’t be so.	Nixtieq li ma kellux ikun hekk.
But you know that.	Imma int taf li.
What should he do?	X'għandu jagħmel?.
And that would be good.	U dan ikun tajjeb.
I need to hear and see better	Għandi bżonn nisma’ u nara aħjar
But he was so scared at the time.	Imma kien tant jibża’ dak iż-żmien.
I never say no.	Jien qatt ma ngħid le.
I wasn't expecting anyone to be there	Ma kont qed nistenna li xi ħadd ikun hemm
I know what it looks like.	Naf kif jidher.
It's a little over a year.	Huwa ftit aktar minn sena.
But he is not.	Imma hu mhux.
You are saying.	Qed tgħid.
Maybe he should go home.	Forsi għandu jmur id-dar.
It doesn't have to be.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun.
I think you can say something like that.	Naħseb li tista' tgħid xi ħaġa bħal din.
I really thought he was watching	Verament ħsibt li kien qed jara
I don't have much time	M'għandix ħafna ħin
He did a little of this and that.	Għamel ftit minn dan u dak.
I could only hope.	Stajt nittama biss.
I can’t take all this	Ma nistax nieħu dan kollu
I do enough for a year	Nagħmel biżżejjed għal sena
Maybe it could be helpful for someone else out there.	Forsi jista 'jkun ta' għajnuna għal xi ħadd ieħor hemmhekk.
I wanted to do everything	Jien ridt nagħmel dak kollu
Now I understand why.	Issa nifhem għaliex.
I need the truth, people	Għandi bżonn il-verità, nies
Not to anyone.	Mhux lil ħadd.
It could be for you too.	Jista’ jkun għalik ukoll.
I think I either did a lot or not enough.	Naħseb li jew għamilt ħafna jew mhux biżżejjed.
I can’t believe it happened	Ma nistax nemmen li ġara
A little back.	Lura ftit.
Little money	Ftit flus
I want this to work for me too.	Irrid li dan jaħdem ukoll għalija.
I believed he did	Kont nemmen li hekk għamel
I had no idea what that might be	Ma kelli l-ebda idea dwar dak li jista 'jkun
It was like where we were right now.	Kien qisu fejn konna bħalissa.
Everything works the same.	Kollox jaħdem l-istess.
To be better people.	Li nkunu nies aħjar.
You really are.	Int verament.
Everyone wanted to know who did it.	Kulħadd ried ikun jaf min għamel dan.
It has to be something you are willing to do.	Trid tkun xi ħaġa li tkun lest li tagħmel.
I heard, but I couldn't hear anyone talking	Smajt, imma ma stajt nisma lil ħadd jitkellem
I had never seen anything so beautiful.	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa daqshekk sabiħa.
I had done it before	Kont għamilt qabel
I can see the following	Nista' nara li ġej
Sit down again.	Poġġa bilqiegħda mill-ġdid.
But so it was.	Imma hekk kien.
Usually this is not a problem.	Normalment din mhix xi problema.
Not about that.	Mhux dwar dan.
I would be nothing today	Jien ma nkun xejn illum
She is already here.	Hi diġà hawn.
Don't do anything.	M'għandekx tagħmel xejn.
You had me for a while there.	Kellek lili għal xi żmien hemm.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
And much, much more.	U ħafna, ħafna aktar.
I was going there for me	Kont sejjer hemm għalija
I couldn't wait to see what happened next	Ma kontx nistenna x’ġara wara
I don’t know why really.	Ma nafx għaliex verament.
I doubt there is more	Niddubita li hemm aktar
I don’t have to say why.	M'għandix għalfejn ngħid għaliex.
I didn’t want to eat	Ma ridtx niekol
He was there.	Huwa kien hemm.
I was waiting.	Kont qed nistenna.
I heard about what happened outside	Smajt dwar dak li ġara barra
He always knows what to do.	Huwa dejjem jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
You and she.	Inti u hi.
I knew exactly what was going on	Kont naf eżatt x’qed jiġri
That was not enough.	Dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
It will be good, he thought.	Hija se tkun tajba, ħaseb.
This really, really works.	Dan tassew, tassew jaħdem.
I really wanted to be with you	Jien tant ridt inkun miegħek
The problem is that there will be no more.	Il-problema hi li mhux se jkun hemm aktar.
Without a job.	Mingħajr xogħol.
I didn't want to see what happened next.	Ma ridtx nara x’ġara wara.
But she knew better.	Imma hi kienet taf aħjar.
They are doing so as soon as possible.	Huma qed jagħmlu hekk malajr kemm jista 'jkun.
I came here to eat something	Ġejt hawn biex niekol xi ħaġa
It's just a thing for you.	Huwa biss ħaġa għalik.
I didn't have to do anything	Ma kelli nagħmel xejn
If there is one.	Jekk hemm wieħed.
She will say no.	Hi ser tgħid le.
I will do many things	Se nagħmel ħafna affarijiet
But here it is.	Imma hawn hu.
I was no better than I was	Jien ma kontx aħjar milli kien
Obviously there is something to this.	Ovvjament hemm xi ħaġa għal dan.
I should have known that	I kellha naf li kieku
That was hard.	Dak kien diffiċli.
There is nothing more than that.	M'hemm xejn aktar minn dan.
We need to know for sure.	Irridu nkunu nafu żgur.
There shouldn't be so many unemployed people.	M'għandux ikun hemm daqshekk nies bla xogħol.
I loved doing such things	Kont inħobb nagħmel affarijiet bħal dawn
I'm back now.	Jien lura issa.
I think he will never know it was me.	Naħseb li qatt mhu se jkun jaf li kont jien.
If it never came, he thought.	Kieku qatt ma jiġi, ħaseb.
Which is a problem.	Li hija problema.
I can't say no.	Ma nistax ngħid le.
So would you.	Hekk kieku int.
I think I can do that by this time	Naħseb li nista' nagħmel dan b'dan iż-żmien
No one else will ever either.	Ħadd ieħor qatt se lanqas.
I have some ready by morning	Ikolli xi lest sa filgħodu
There was nothing else to say.	Ma kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra xi tgħid.
I wasn't even afraid	Jien lanqas kont nibża’
And I saw a few people.	U rajt ftit nies.
Someone else is doing better.	Xi ħadd ieħor qed jagħmel aħjar.
Many, in fact.	Ħafna, fil-fatt.
I did nothing here	Jien ma għamilt xejn hawn
This is what you do.	Dan huwa dak li tagħmel.
After a while you see everything.	Wara ftit tara kollox.
Of course I say no.	Ovvjament ngħid le.
Enough.	Biżżejjed.
It’s the only thing it really does.	Hija l-unika ħaġa li tagħmel verament.
That will say a lot	Dan se ngħid ħafna
I have to do the same thing.	Għandi nagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
I couldn’t wait to eat	Ma stajtx nistenna biex niekol
I have no idea why this is so difficult.	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex dan huwa daqshekk diffiċli.
I thought it was there forever	Ħsibt li kien hemm għal dejjem
So it seemed.	Hekk kien jidher.
That she now knew.	Li issa kienet taf.
She would see things.	Kienet tara l-affarijiet.
You are just one.	Inti biss wieħed.
He is not. 	Hu mhux. 
You never will be.	Inti qatt mhu se tkun.
Nothing was too good for us.	Xejn ma kien tajjeb wisq għalina.
I was just wondering where they were	Kont biss nistaqsi fejn kienu
Maybe you’re good at this.	Forsi int tajjeb b'dan.
I think he was doing it again.	Naħseb li kien qed jagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
That’s not the same thing.	Dik mhix l-istess ħaġa.
I didn’t know she was here	Ma kontx naf li kienet hawn
But you wouldn't.	Imma inti ma tkunx.
I really didn't know what to believe	Verament ma kontx naf x’se nemmen
That’s all there is to it.	Dak kollu huwa xi ħaġa.
His work was done.	Ix-xogħol tiegħu sar.
I’m sure she’s never been there before	Jiena ċert li qatt ma kienet hemm qabel
But it was something more than that.	Imma kienet xi ħaġa aktar minn hekk.
I knew it could only be one thing.	Kont naf li tista’ tkun ħaġa waħda biss.
This is just wrong.	Dan huwa biss ħażin.
I do the same with him.	Nagħmel l-istess miegħu.
I just need to see what he does	Għandi bżonn biss nara x'qed jagħmel
It was having too much fun.	Kien qed jieħu gost wisq.
I didn’t have to do that.	Jien ma kellix nagħmel hekk.
That was a lot of work.	Dan kien ħafna xogħol.
I will never buy here again	Qatt ma nerġa’ nixtri hawn
You don’t have to go, you know.	M'għandekx għalfejn tmur, taf.
And there were a few times.	U kien hemm ftit drabi.
It happened really fast.	Ġara tassew malajr.
I wasn't sure before	Ma kontx ċert qabel
I once had one like that.	Darba kelli waħda bħal dik.
I can’t believe anyone does that	Ma nistax nemmen li xi ħadd jagħmel hekk
Ask if anyone wanted to go back.	Staqsa jekk xi ħadd riedx imur lura.
Long ago as well now.	Ilu kif ukoll issa.
This should not be difficult.	Dan m'għandux ikun diffiċli.
I couldn’t get too much out of this	Ma stajtx nieħu wisq minn dan
There's nothing I can do about it	Ma nista nagħmel xejn, qiegħed hawn
Just me.	Jien biss.
I have to try to do something	Ikolli nipprova nagħmel xi ħaġa
i needed more.	kelli bżonn aktar.
It was nothing like here.	Ma kien xejn bħal hawn.
I think it looks pretty good.	Naħseb li jidher pjuttost tajjeb.
I had a good idea what she was thinking	Kelli idea tajba ta’ dak li taħseb hi
I'm not there yet.	Għadni mhux hemm.
I want everything to stay the same.	Irrid li kollox jibqa l-istess.
I want everyone to have a job.	Irrid li kulħadd ikollu xogħol.
And he had his things.	U kellu l-affarijiet tiegħu.
He couldn't wait any longer.	Ma setax jistenna aktar.
I wonder where we are going	Nistaqsi fejn se mmorru
That was not the case.	Dan ma kienx hekk.
I will do so.	Jien se nagħmel hekk.
Why? 	Għaliex?
And maybe you are.	U forsi int.
But we just had a good time	Imma biss kellna ħin tajjeb
I'll do something big later	Jien ser nagħmel xi ħaġa kbira aktar tard
I know where he lives	Naf fejn joqgħod
You think you can, but you can't.	Taħseb li tista’, imma ma tistax.
I understand if anyone wants out	Nifhem jekk xi ħadd irid barra
That works well.	Li jaħdem tajjeb.
I will never talk like that.	Jien qatt ma se nitkellem hekk.
And he actually seemed happy.	U fil-fatt deher kuntent.
I was able to do that	I kien kapaċi nagħmel dan
I think he’s a good man	Naħseb li hu raġel tajjeb
He saw that.	Huwa ra li.
We do this as follows.	Aħna nagħmlu dan kif ġej.
I saw it from here on out	Rajt minn hawn barra
I just wanted to be out of there	Ridt biss inkun barra minn hemm
Is that enough ?.	Dan biżżejjed?.
But you can do that from there as well.	Imma int tista’ tagħmel dan minn hemm ukoll.
Now she really wants one.	Issa hi verament trid waħda.
If you're sure.	Jekk int żgur.
Not there yet.	Għadu mhux hemm.
This is not good or bad.	Dan mhux tajjeb jew ħażin.
It's that for you.	Hu dak għalik.
I was looking forward to talking to him sooner	Kont qed nistenna li nitkellem miegħu aktar kmieni
I heard what you have to say	Smajt dak li għandek xi tgħid
I could tell she was tired	Stajt ngħid li kienet għajjien
But it was hard, hard.	Imma kien diffiċli, diffiċli.
I know what's on	Naf x'hemm fuq
He was very worried.	Huwa kien inkwetat ħafna.
This I can't believe either	Dan lanqas jien ma nistax nemmen
But few say so.	Imma ftit jgħid hekk.
I didn’t have to tell you any of this	Jien ma kellix ngħidlek xi ħaġa minn dan
You were both right.	Kellek raġun it-tnejn.
It was my first but it won’t be my last.	Kien l-ewwel tiegħi imma mhux se jkun l-aħħar tiegħi.
But she wasn’t ready.	Imma ma kinitx lest.
Very little.	Ftit ħafna.
And for hours.	U għal sigħat.
This took some time.	Dan ħa xi żmien.
I know you want to be very busy	Naf li trid tkun okkupat ħafna
But we had very little.	Imma ftit li xejn kellna.
It’s really too big for me.	Huwa verament kbir wisq għalija.
For both of us.	Għalina t-tnejn.
Not everyone can say the same.	Mhux kulħadd jista’ jgħid l-istess.
I didn’t want to be here myself	Jien ma ridtx inkun hawn jien
I don’t expect him to either	Nistenna li hu lanqas
But he’s really not a bad man.	Imma hu verament mhux raġel ħażin.
I thought I said I wanted to.	Ħsibt li għidt li ridt hekk.
I couldn’t take any chances	Ma stajt nieħu l-ebda ċans
Doing the job is hard enough.	Li tagħmel ix-xogħol huwa diffiċli biżżejjed.
I hope he knew what he was doing	Jien nittama li kien jaf x’qed jagħmel
But she wouldn’t want that.	Imma hi ma tkunx trid hekk.
I have to take all this with me now	Ikolli nieħu dan kollu miegħi issa
All that work.	Dak ix-xogħol kollu.
I think that’s how it is	Naħseb li hu kif hu
He left, never to return.	Telaq, qatt ma jerġa’ lura.
He is my friend.	Huwa ħabib tiegħi.
I was actually there	Fil-fatt kont hemm
For you as well as for me.	Għalik kif ukoll għalija.
I can’t take much more	Ma nistax nieħu ħafna aktar
I didn’t even know he was going to be home	Lanqas kont naf li kien se jkun id-dar
I made a really good friend	Għamilt ħabib tassew tajjeb
I couldn't say why	Ma stajtx ngħid għaliex
But if you can.	Imma jekk tista’.
He knew that really.	Huwa kien jaf li verament.
He really, really played.	Huwa verament, verament kellu.
Not that he would ever do something like that.	Mhux li qatt kien jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I saw this, I couldn’t speak	Rajt dan, ma stajtx nitkellem
Have fun, probably.	Tieħu gost, probabbilment.
I said it was you	Jien għedt li tkun int
And on and on.	U fuq u fuq.
That's it.	Din hija dik.
I can’t wait for that time	Ma nistax nistenna dak iż-żmien
I had that years ago.	Kelli dak snin ilu.
I just didn’t want to believe it	Biss ma ridtx nemmen
He obviously could never do that.	Huwa ovvjament qatt ma jista 'jagħmel dan.
But that may not be the case.	Imma jista’ ma jkunx hekk.
Now, here are the things you need to know.	Issa, hawn huma l-affarijiet li għandek bżonn tkun taf.
But tomorrow evening.	Imma għada filgħaxija.
Glad it was good.	Ferħan li kien tajjeb.
He was very glad.	Huwa kien ferħan ħafna.
Currently.	Bħalissa.
In fact, we don't.	Fil-fatt, aħna ma.
Whatever you need.	Tkun xi tkun għandek bżonn.
But you have to do things.	Imma trid tagħmel l-affarijiet.
I knew someone had to know something	Kont naf li xi ħadd kellu jkun jaf xi ħaġa
And once I did too.	U darba għamilt ukoll.
Everyone goes home happy.	Kulħadd imur id-dar ferħan.
But now it’s time.	Imma issa wasal iż-żmien.
But there was nothing he could do.	Imma ma seta’ jagħmel xejn.
Where he lives.	Fejn jgħix.
he asked.	staqsa.
I had never done anything like this before	Qatt ma kont għamilt xi ħaġa bħal din qabel
I can't say anything about that	Ma nista’ ngħid xejn dwar dan
I didn't even think about it	Lanqas ma ħsibt
He did not come out.	Huwa ma ħareġ.
All right.	Kollox tajjeb.
That wasn’t working.	Dak ma kienx qed jaħdem.
I will never do this again	Qatt ma nagħmel dan mill-ġdid
I wanted to do something difficult	Ridt nagħmel xi ħaġa diffiċli
I have a lot of time really	Għandi ħafna ħin verament
I'm sure you're surprised.	Jien ċert li int sorpriż.
So did the dog.	Hekk għamel il-kelb.
But as long as it is needed.	Imma sakemm ikun hemm bżonn.
Obviously yours.	Ovvjament tiegħek.
I’ve always been that way.	Dejjem kont hekk.
I have to do it myself	Ikolli nagħmel dan jien
I hope you see all this now	Nispera li tara dan kollu issa
I never thought so	Qatt ma kont naħseb
All right again.	Kollox mill-ġdid tajjeb.
You or someone.	Inti jew xi ħadd.
I suspect he is right.	Nissuspetta li għandu raġun.
I couldn't see where we were	Ma stajtx nara fejn konna
I was probably saying that too	Probabbilment kont ngħid hekk ukoll
If not for a long time after that.	Jekk mhux għal żmien twil wara dak.
I know you will.	Naf li inti se.
Also, not for me.	Barra minn hekk, mhux għalija.
He has me.	Huwa għandu lili.
He has to do what he wants.	Għandu jagħmel li jrid.
I never thought I would do such a thing	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din
It wasn't easy.	Ma kienx faċli.
It was easy.	Kienet faċli.
And there it was.	U hemm kienet.
To know where you are going, where things are.	Li tkun taf fejn tmur, fejn huma l-affarijiet.
There he is.	Hemmhekk hu.
It would be really good.	Ikun tassew tajjeb.
He has done this before.	Huwa għamel dan qabel.
I thought you would be fine	Ħsibt li inti tkun tajjeb
I was not alone in the room	Ma kontx waħdi fil-kamra
Maybe it’s not so bad.	Forsi mhuwiex daqshekk ħażin daqshekk.
I have a lot of money now	Għandi ħafna flus issa
So much the better.	Daqshekk aħjar.
More than ever.	Aktar minn qatt qabel.
But now there was nothing.	Imma issa ma kien hemm xejn.
We have to do a lot of this.	Irridu nagħmlu ħafna minn dan.
I think you know where	Naħseb li taf fejn
But we did a lot.	Imma għamilna ħafna.
She was right, too.	Hija kellha raġun, ukoll.
I need to take some time	Għandi bżonn nieħu ftit ħin
I needed to know what was going on	Kelli nkun naf x’kien hemm
It wasn’t a problem.	Ma kinitx problema.
But it was not as easy as it seemed.	Imma ma kienx faċli kif deher.
This will not work.	Dan mhux se jaħdem.
Maybe someone would be home.	Forsi xi ħadd ikun id-dar.
I wasn’t listening.	Jien ma kontx nisma.
You are still very young.	Għadek żgħir ħafna.
I didn’t know much about it.	Ma kontx naf ħafna dwarha.
No one else can do this for you.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jagħmel dan għalik.
I wanted it so badly	Jien ridt hekk ħażin
You really are.	Int verament se.
I hope it happens again	Nispera li jerġa' jiġri
He was at work, he said.	Huwa kien fuq ix-xogħol, huwa qal.
That's what he does.	Dak hu jagħmel.
I would like to buy a car.	Nixtieq nixtri karozza.
And it’s hard to see.	U huwa diffiċli biex tara.
It was the last thing he did.	Kienet l-aħħar ħaġa li għamel.
This will not work.	Dan mhux se jaħdem.
I believe he wanted to	Nemmen li ried
And there it was.	U kien hemm.
I could go for that one as well	I jista 'jmur għal dak wieħed ukoll
I thought it would be good	Ħsibt li jkun tajjeb
About knowing you.	Dwar li tkun taf int.
It's not that hard.	Mhuwiex daqshekk diffiċli ħafna.
I was really doing this	Jien kont qed nagħmel dan tassew
There must be something else you can do.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa oħra li tista 'tagħmel.
I want you to think about it	Irrid li taħseb dwar dan
Wrong is wrong.	Ħażin huwa ħażin.
I still didn’t want to think about it	Għadni ma ridtx naħseb dwar dan
This is not the case.	Dan fil-fatt mhux hekk.
You can go.	Inti tista 'tmur.
I did a few of these a few years ago	Għamilt xi ftit minn dawn ftit snin ilu
Not just a little more, not just a little.	Mhux biss ftit aktar, mhux biss ftit.
Better than you think.	Aħjar milli taħseb.
He had to get there first.	Kellu jasal hemm l-ewwel.
I don't need any help.	M'għandi bżonn l-ebda għajnuna.
That's what he wants.	Dak hu li jrid.
There will be no need for more.	Mhux se jkun hemm bżonn aktar.
This is our school.	Din hija l-iskola tagħna.
I knew he was going to say something	Kont naf li se tgħid xi ħaġa
I can’t tell you more about that	Ma nistax ngħidlek aktar dwar dan
You may be the only one talking.	Inti tista 'tkun l-uniku wieħed jitkellem.
Or so I thought.	Jew hekk ħsibt.
I’m pretty sure they never were.	Jien pjuttost ċert li qatt ma kienu.
I couldn’t think of anything to say.	Ma stajt naħseb xi ngħid.
I knew something was wrong	Kont naf li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina
I went outside before to see me.	Jien mort barra qabel biex nara jien.
I want you to know that you are not alone	Irrid li tkun taf li m'intix waħdek
I think it should be.	Naħseb li għandu jkun.
They were too.	Kienu wisq.
I knew how it was	Kont naf kif kien
I had more time and always did more	Kelli aktar ħin u dejjem għamilt aktar
The only one I am.	L-uniku jien jien.
I'd like to go back soon	Inħobb nerġa' mmur lura dalwaqt
I highly doubt it will come from this.	Niddubita ħafna li se jiġi minn dan.
You’re someone who has things.	Int xi ħadd li għandu affarijiet.
I thought he did a good job	Ħsibt li għamel xogħol tajjeb
They happen.	Dawn jiġri.
You are not a good man.	M'intix raġel tajjeb.
I'm surprised you're here.	Jien sorpriż li qiegħed hawn.
I didn't have to say that.	Jien ma kellix ngħid hekk.
We had to go back.	Kellna mmorru lura.
I didn’t want to at that time	Ma ridtx dak iż-żmien
I was no longer in my room	I ma kontx aktar fil-kamra tiegħi
I was still thinking	Kont għadni naħseb
They probably are.	Huma probabbilment.
I really think this is our last chance	Verament naħseb li dan huwa l-aħħar ċans tagħna
I wanted to know everything	Ridt inkun naf kollox
I thought I would say so	Ħsibt li tgħid hekk
Such things.	Affarijiet bħal dawn.
Never a good idea.	Qatt idea tajba.
I doubt one ever did	Niddubita li wieħed qatt għamel
We now know for sure.	Dak kollu issa nafu żgur.
I just thought it was time	Ħsibt biss li kien wasal iż-żmien
For hours on end.	Għal sigħat wara xulxin.
He is not there.	Hu mhux hemm.
Wherever you are, you better go back there.	Tkun fejn tkun, aħjar tmur lura hemm.
But he was not speaking.	Imma ma kienx jitkellem.
But not without fun.	Imma mhux mingħajr gost.
No more fun.	Mhux aktar gost.
It seemed you needed a friend.	Deher li għandek bżonn ħabib.
I did everything together.	Għamilt kollox flimkien.
Really, it could be anything.	Tassew, jista 'jkun xejn.
I saw a few as well.	Rajt ftit ukoll.
But to each of his own.	Imma lil kull wieħed tiegħu.
I was never one.	Qatt ma kont wieħed.
She was too.	Kienet ukoll.
We never have.	Qatt ma għandna.
He could go there.	Seta’ jmur hemm.
I think you are right.	Naħseb li għandek raġun.
I want to do things like that.	Nixtieq nagħmel affarijiet bħal dawn.
We have problems.	Għandna problemi.
I still had to think about all this	Għadni kelli naħseb dwar dan kollu
It was years ago now.	Kien snin ilu issa.
Well, you don't.	Ukoll, inti ma.
I just couldn’t go.	I biss ma stajtx immur.
That was something more.	Din kienet xi ħaġa aktar.
I have to eat.	Ikolli niekol.
I think that would be good	Naħseb li jkun tajjeb
I had to try	Kelli nipprova
Someone has.	Xi ħadd għandu.
It never came out.	Qatt ma ħareġ.
It’s not what it seems.	Mhuwiex dak li jidher.
I love when he does that	Inħobb meta jagħmel hekk
He could not stay here.	Ma setax jibqa’ hawn.
I wasn’t always there for you	Jien mhux dejjem kont hemm għalik
You seem to know a few things.	Jidher li taf ftit affarijiet.
I was here now.	Jien kont hawn issa.
I want to know everything	Irrid inkun naf kollox
I will never be alone again	Qatt ma nkun waħdi mill-ġdid
That was not my problem.	Dik ma kinitx il-problema tiegħi.
I knew it was for me	Kont naf li kien għalija
That's it.	Dak sar.
Me or mine.	Jien jew tiegħi.
We know what's in there.	Nafu x’inhu hemmhekk.
I saw where this was going	Rajt fejn kien sejjer dan
I wonder why.	Nistaqsi għaliex.
I hope it would.	Jien nittama li kieku.
It looks bad outside.	Jidher ħażin barra.
It could be anything.	Jista 'jkun xi ħaġa.
I really wasn't sure what to say	Verament ma kontx ċert x’se ngħid
He had little time.	Kellu ftit ħin.
I think everything	Naħseb li kollox
He said.	Hu qal .
Help was probably a good idea.	L-għajnuna probabbilment kienet idea tajba.
Look around the house.	Ħares madwar id-dar.
What we do now is this.	Dak li nagħmlu issa huwa dan.
But we were a little late.	Imma konna ftit tard.
I was going to be late	Kont se nkun tard
I was actually scared	Fil-fatt kont nibża’
You do more than what works.	Inti tagħmel aktar minn dak li jaħdem.
None of this will work anymore.	Xejn minn dan mhu se jaħdem aktar.
Maybe you already have.	Forsi diġà għandek.
It's good, he thought.	Huwa tajjeb, ħaseb.
Later that morning.	Aktar tard dak filgħodu.
But look at a lot of people.	Imma ħares lejn ħafna nies.
I didn’t have to do that	Jien ma kellix għalfejn nagħmel hekk
I want to know what he really did	Irrid inkun naf x’kien verament jagħmel
I’m not going to do anything big out of this	Mhux se nagħmel xi ħaġa kbira minn dan
Maybe he's busy.	Forsi hu okkupat.
I’ve been thinking about this for a long time	Ħsibt dwar dan għal żmien twil
I think it’s time.	Naħseb li wasal iż-żmien.
I know what you're doing	Naf x'qed tagħmel
I often think that.	Ħafna drabi naħseb li.
I have been here for over a year	Ilni hawn aktar minn sena
Too little, too late.	Ftit wisq, tard wisq.
Not even if it was good.	Lanqas kieku kienet tajba.
He did not want to stay and help anyone.	Ma ried jibqa’ u jgħin lil ħadd.
He had a better idea.	Kellu idea aħjar.
Try things.	Ipprova l-affarijiet.
I want to be better than her.	Irrid li tkun aħjar milli hi.
I knew she wouldn't show up	Kont naf li hi mhux se tidher
I couldn’t speak until a few hours ago	Ma stajtx nitkellem sa ftit sigħat ilu
This will be easy.	Dan se jkun faċli.
And nothing is wrong.	U xejn mhu ħażin.
I just need to know that there is	Għandi bżonn biss inkun naf li hemm
People you should know.	Nies li għandek tkun taf.
I could go back	Stajt immur lura
I didn’t know anything about it	Jien ma kont naf xejn dwarha
I can do that, you know	Jien nista' nagħmel dan, taf
I couldn’t figure out how to do that	Ma stajtx nifhem kif nagħmel dan
We have only one child.	Għandna tifel wieħed biss.
I can't tell you for sure.	Ma nistax ngħidlek żgur.
I wanted to be someone else	Ridt inkun xi ħadd ieħor
I was tired, so, so tired	Kont għajjien, hekk, tant għajjien
I can try that someday.	Nista’ nipprova hekk xi darba.
I was good with that.	I kien tajjeb ma 'dak.
No problem yet.	Għadu l-ebda problema.
Too much talking.	Wisq titkellem.
He will come back to me.	Hu ser jiġi lura għandi.
I'm not surprised.	M'iniex sorpriż.
You can tell.	Tista' tgħid.
I know what's going on there	Naf x’qed jiġri hemmhekk
And so it happens.	U hekk jiġri.
You know how to do it.	Taf kif jagħmel.
I think he did the same for him	Naħseb li għamel l-istess għalih
But this was not so.	Imma dan ma kienx hekk.
They don't.	Huma ma.
I didn’t say that	Jien ma għidt hekk
Other people are very busy.	Nies oħra huma ħafna xogħol.
She was probably never here.	Probabbilment qatt ma kienet hawn.
I can say all things	Nista' ngħid l-affarijiet kollha
And, on and on.	U, fuq u fuq.
That's yours.	Dak hu tiegħek.
But here are some things you can do.	Imma hawn xi affarijiet li tista 'tagħmel.
I did it, just now.	Jien għamilt dan, biss issa.
There is no way it could have happened.	M'hemm l-ebda mod kif seta' ġara.
There is no one here.	M'hemm ħadd hawn.
It was too fast for him.	Kienet wisq malajr għalih.
I couldn’t do anything else.	Ma stajt nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
This is what is there.	Dan hu li qed hemm.
But for me, no more.	Imma għalija, mhux aktar.
I just don’t.	Jien biss le.
I've seen some of what you can do.	Rajt xi ftit minn dak li tista’ tagħmel.
It was me.	Jien kont jien.
He had been there before.	Huwa kien hemm qabel.
I was trying to do that	Jien kont qed nipprova nagħmel hekk
I thought you should know	Ħsibt li għandek tkun taf
You can do pretty much anything you want.	Tista 'tagħmel ħafna kull ħaġa li trid.
But he was glad to come home.	Imma kien ferħan li ġej id-dar.
I need to know what he is going to say	Għandi bżonn inkun naf x’kien se jgħid
I wonder what he says? 	Nistaqsi dak li jgħid?
And it was just as it was.	U kien eżatt kif kien.
This we knew.	Dan konna nafu.
He sat back.	Huwa poġġa lura.
We know little about it.	Nafu ftit dwarha.
I didn’t want to know.	Ma ridtx tkun taf.
A lot of time for us	Żmien ta’ ħafna għalina
I would like to know	Nixtieq inkun naf
I believe what she says	Jien nemmen dak li tgħid hi
He was fine but needed some work	Kien tajjeb imma kellu bżonn ftit xogħol
We just do.	Aħna biss nagħmlu.
I'll be late.	Jien ser inkun tard.
I didn't know what to say	Ma kontx naf x’se ngħid
I have no idea what's outside that door	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'hemm barra dak il-bieb
She played for a long time.	Hija kellha għal żmien twil.
I won't, not for you either.	Jien mhux se, lanqas għalik.
But he is good.	Imma hu tajjeb.
Want to know a little more ?.	Trid tkun taf ftit aktar?.
We just did that.	Hekk għamilna biss.
I can’t say why right now	Ma nistax ngħid għaliex bħalissa
Nothing you can do about it.	Xejn li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
I so badly didn’t want to leave	Jien tant ħażin ma ridtx li jitlaq
I know he wants to help.	Naf li jrid jgħin.
It should be good.	Għandu jkun tajjeb.
It was three years ago.	Kien tliet snin ilu.
I didn’t know many people.	Ma kontx naf ħafna nies.
I wonder how he is doing and he says well	Nistaqsi kif sejjer u jgħid tajjeb
I think the same.	Naħseb l-istess.
I thought, she's just scared	Ħsibt, hija biss jibża
I was hoping you could tell	Kont nittama li tista’ tgħidli
It was always easy to talk to him before.	Dejjem kien faċli li titkellem miegħu qabel.
Well, just about anything.	Ukoll, biss dwar xi ħaġa.
I'm just not sure.	Jien biss mhux ċert.
I didn't know what to say at the time	Dak iż-żmien ma kontx naf x’se ngħid
I could never eat like that	Qatt ma stajt niekol hekk
I just came to tell you so	Ġejt biss biex ngħidlek hekk
I knew it couldn’t happen	Kont naf li ma setax jiġri
I could be wrong.	Nista’ nkun ħażin ħażin.
I always knew this was coming	Dejjem kont naf li dan kien ġej
I need time more than anything else	Għandi bżonn iż-żmien aktar minn kull ħaġa oħra
I was worried about the same thing.	Jien kont inkwetat dwar l-istess ħaġa.
So far so good.	Sa issa kollox mar tajjeb.
I'm really tired now	Jien tassew għajjien issa
No one was watching.	Ħadd ma kien jara.
It's better than that.	Huwa aħjar minn hekk.
I couldn’t figure out how to take it with me	Ma stajtx nifhem kif nieħu miegħi
Nothing is left behind.	Xejn ma jibqa’ lura.
I wonder how to do that	Nistaqsi kif tagħmel dan
I was hoping to find out what was going on	Kont nittama li tkun taf x’inhu jiġri
Maybe it’s nothing.	Forsi mhu xejn.
I know she did.	Naf li hi għamlet.
Not for you.	Mhux għalik.
I will definitely go again	Żgur li nerġa' mmur
I wanted to know who he was	Ridt inkun naf min kien
I’m not sure why, but sure	M'inix ċert għaliex, imma żgur
It’s like I said before.	Huwa kif għidt qabel.
I didn't even think about it, it just came out	Lanqas ħsibt, biss ħareġ kollox
It’s great to see that.	Huwa kbir li tara dan.
There can be no more.	Ma jistax ikun hemm aktar.
I really want to talk to you.	Irrid verament nitkellem miegħek.
I don’t think anyone lived there.	Ma naħsibx li xi ħadd kien jgħix hemm.
I am not alone in doing this	Jien mhux waħdi li nagħmel dan
Here are a few things you should definitely do.	Hawn huma ftit affarijiet li żgur għandek tagħmel.
I never had a chance.	Qatt ma kelli ċans.
I can't understand this.	Ma nistax nifhem dan.
I can't understand what's going on with this	Ma nistax nifhem x'qed jiġri ma' dan
A little too small.	Ftit żgħir wisq.
I couldn't see outside	Ma stajtx nara barra
And he was definitely a good friend.	U żgur li kien ħabib tajjeb.
But it was too late.	Imma kien tard wisq.
You have enough time.	Għandek ħin biżżejjed.
I don’t think it ever will	Ma naħsibx li qatt se
I should be very tired	Għandi nkun għajjien ħafna
Same thing again.	L-istess ħaġa mill-ġdid.
I'm a teacher.	Jien għalliem.
You have to think for everyone.	Trid taħseb għal kulħadd.
I know he was very busy trying to help everyone	Naf li kien okkupat ħafna jipprova jgħin lil kulħadd
I can’t wait to see mine.	Ma nistax nistenna li jara tiegħi.
It looks like fun !.	Qisu gost!.
I can't do this for you anymore	Ma nistax nagħmel dan għalik aktar
I would do the same	Nixtieq nagħmel l-istess
Who would have thought.	Min kien jaħseb.
This is wrong.	Dan huwa ħażin.
But there may be.	Imma jista’ jkun hemm.
I know I've never seen one	Naf li qatt ma rajt wieħed
I think it will be long before	Naħseb li se jkun ħafna qabel
Do what you have to.	Tagħmel dak li għandek.
I’ve always seen the truth there, like now	Dejjem rajt il-verità hemmhekk, bħal issa
Or rather, difficult for me.	Jew aħjar, diffiċli għalija.
I did something else	Għamilt xi ħaġa oħra
I thought that for years.	Ħsibt li għal snin.
I think it’s both.	Naħseb li huwa t-tnejn.
It is very easy to see this.	Huwa faċli ħafna li tara dan.
I just needed to know what would happen next	Kelli biss inkun naf x'se jiġri wara
You can do this if you want.	Tista 'tagħmel dan jekk trid.
I was expecting more, much more	Kont qed nistenna aktar, ħafna aktar
Maybe very often.	Forsi ħafna drabi.
That was fun tonight.	Dan kien gost illejla.
I had no idea where all this was coming from	Ma kellix idea minn fejn kien ġej dan kollu
It just does what it does.	Jagħmel biss dak li tagħmel.
I can't believe she's mine	Ma nistax nemmen li hi tiegħi
It's a really good job.	Huwa tassew xogħol tajjeb.
But she was, someday.	Imma hi kienet, xi darba.
He wanted something else.	Ried xi ħaġa oħra.
It was just.	Kien biss.
I was right.	Kelli raġun.
Which is hard.	Li huwa diffiċli.
He did for a while.	Huwa għamel għal xi żmien.
You can't do that.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan.
I hope you stay	Nispera li toqgħod
This is just the first one.	Din hija biss l-ewwel waħda.
I just thought maybe you know something	Ħsibt biss li forsi taf xi ħaġa
I may be the only one who is not surprised	Jien nista’ nkun l-uniku wieħed li mhux sorpriż
I want to know if it's there.	Irrid inkun naf jekk hux hemm.
I couldn’t believe he was still there	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien għadu hemm
I never do that to a child	Qatt ma nagħmel hekk lil tifel
I wasn’t wrong	Ma kellix ħażin
You're the problem.	Int il-problema.
It's like nothing.	Huwa bħal xejn.
I know there has to be something	Naf li jrid ikun hemm xi ħaġa
There was no time to think.	Ma kienx hemm ħin biex taħseb.
I had never seen anything like it	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa bħal dik
But there was something wrong here.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa ħażina hawn.
There seemed to be nothing here.	Ma deher li kien hemm xejn hawn.
I was going to talk to you about it, actually.	Kont se nitkellem miegħek dwarha, fil-fatt.
In fact it can take a few years.	Fil-fatt jista 'jieħu ftit snin.
I didn’t want to be there	Ma ridtx inkun hemm
I wasn’t worried about it	Ma kontx inkwetat dwarha
I can't just stay here	Ma nistax noqgħod hawn biss
I knew I was there	Kont naf li kont hemm
I don’t think so.	Ma naħsibx li hu hekk.
This is who they are, this is what they do.	Dan hu min huma, dan huwa dak li jagħmlu.
I didn’t want to do that	Ma ridtx nagħmel dan
You definitely can't do that.	Inti żgur ma tistax tagħmel dan.
It's good.	Huwa tajjeb.
I’ve been thinking about it a lot	Ilni naħseb dwarha ħafna
I had to take it with me.	I kellha tieħu miegħi.
I needed both.	Jien kelli bżonn it-tnejn.
I love everything about being a man and a man	Inħobb kollox dwar li nkun raġel u raġel
I had to do this before	I kellha tagħmel dan qabel
There is nothing.	M'hemm xejn.
And it happened, once.	U ġara, darba.
I haven’t had one in years	Ilni ma kelli waħda għal snin
I thought it might be good	Ħsibt li jista 'jkun tajjeb
This will surely never happen.	Dan żgur li qatt mhu se jiġri.
Everyone knows you’re there.	Kulħadd jaf li int hemm.
I really wish it was otherwise.	Nixtieq tassew li kien mod ieħor.
Which, of course, she is.	Li, ovvjament, hi.
It just gets better from there.	Huwa biss isir aħjar minn hemm.
I want to understand how you think	Nixtieq nifhem kif taħseb
Not good, but good.	Mhux tajjeb, imma tajjeb.
I have never seen anyone like that.	Qatt ma rajt lil ħadd hekk.
I don’t want money.	Ma rridx flus.
It was what it was and that was it.	Kien dak li kien u dak kien hekk.
This was to be the last time.	Din kellha tkun l-aħħar darba.
Sure, you’re right.	Żgur, għandek raġun.
Can we do that? 	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan?
I hope he couldn’t say	Jien nittama li ma setax jgħid
we can do that.	nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
I know how hard it is	Naf kemm hu diffiċli
He almost didn’t want to.	Kważi ma riedx.
I have to do it all	Ikolli nagħmel dan kollu
I couldn’t take that	Ma stajtx nieħu dan
No one had money.	Ħadd ma kellu flus.
It's the last one.	Huwa l-aħħar.
Anyone can say anything.	Kulħadd jista’ jgħid xi ħaġa.
I just want to.	Nixtieq biss.
Not a man went.	Mhux raġel mar.
Every once in a while.	Kull darba waħda.
Surely there were.	Żgur li hemm kienu.
We cannot do that.	Aħna ma nistgħux nagħmlu dan.
I just didn't know that was what it was	I biss ma kontx naf li huwa dak li kien
Obviously it wasn’t at that time.	Ovvjament ma kienx dak iż-żmien.
When he looked back.	Meta ħares lura.
That's just it.	Hekk hu biss.
We want that.	Irridu hekk.
Maybe you too.	Forsi int ukoll.
Tired but good.	Għajjien imma tajjeb.
I’m still not entirely sure	Għadni mhux ċert għal kollox
He was such a good man.	Kien raġel daqshekk tajjeb.
He did so for me.	Hekk għamel għalija.
Someone else and she would have.	Xi ħadd ieħor u hi kien ikollu.
I wasn’t going to do anything else	Jien ma kont nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra
It was something.	Kienet xi ħaġa.
I want where you are	Irrid fejn int
It has everything.	Għandu kollox.
I came here to talk about nothing.	Ġejt hawn biex titkellem dwar xejn.
I was sitting here waiting	Jien kont noqgħod hawn u nistenna
I was afraid of what they were capable of	Kont nibża’ minn dak li kienu kapaċi
It's good.	Huwa tajjeb.
I am very happy and will definitely buy again	Jien kuntent ħafna u żgur li se nerġa nixtri
It was the same.	Kienet l-istess.
She was not alone.	Hija ma kinitx waħedha.
I had no idea who was here or why	Ma kellix idea min kien hawn jew għaliex
He never knew anyone good that he wasn’t.	Qatt ma kien jaf xi ħadd tajjeb li ma kienx.
I just have something for him	Għandi biss xi ħaġa għalih
I have never seen anything like it.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din.
I know she is.	Naf li hi.
And it does.	U jagħmel.
She was only there for a few hours.	Kienet hemm biss għal ftit sigħat.
I was making friends	Kont qed nagħmel ħbieb
Kelli.	Kelli.
Much better.	Ħafna aħjar.
But so it was.	Imma hekk kien.
It's you.	Huwa int.
Look where you are now.	Ħares fejn qiegħed issa.
It’s not good enough for you.	Hu mhux tajjeb biżżejjed għalik.
It's us.	Huwa magħna.
I believe he wanted to.	Nemmen li ried.
It would have been a little over a year ago.	Kien ikun ftit aktar minn sena ilu.
I think this is what we should do.	Naħseb li dan huwa dak li għandna nagħmlu.
It wasn't.	Ma kienx.
It's been so long.	Ilu hemm tant.
I can’t say it’s a good thing.	Ma nistax ngħid li hija ħaġa tajba.
I didn't need to be here	Ma kellix bżonn inkun hawn
This works well for me.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb għalija.
No one had any idea what he had just said.	Ħadd ma kellu idea x’kien għadu kif qal.
I want to go home and	Irrid immur id-dar u
He is the one who says he is.	Hu min jgħid li hu.
Sure, that’s good.	Żgur, dak tajjeb.
I couldn’t believe this was it	Ma stajtx nemmen li dan kien
He wouldn’t be who he was now.	Ma kienx ikun min kien issa.
No one will ever know.	Ħadd qatt ma jkun jaf.
Someone had to do it	Xi ħadd kellu jagħmel dan
I didn’t even need to think about it	Lanqas ma kelli bżonn naħseb dwarha
I knew it was coming	Kont naf li kien ġej
I can't be late either	Ma nistax inkun tard lanqas
You know, he was coming back for us.	Taf, hu kien jerġa’ lura għalina.
He never wanted to.	Hu qatt ma ried.
And it works very well.	U jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
I know you know what happened	Naf li taf x’ġara
She just.	Hija biss.
I will always be here for you	Jien dejjem se nkun hawn għalik
It doesn’t need that.	M'għandux bżonn dak.
But now it's just like.	Imma issa huwa biss bħal.
Doing this once is easier.	Li tagħmel dan darba huwa aktar faċli.
She will talk to someone.	Hija se titkellem ma 'xi ħadd.
I have never seen anything like it	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din
Not such a good idea.	Mhux idea daqshekk tajba.
It may not be anymore.	Jista 'ma jkunx aktar.
I was thinking about it	Jien kont qed naħseb dwar dan
I want to do it, or no one will	Irrid nagħmel dan, jew ħadd ma se
This is the same for me.	Dan huwa l-istess għalija.
She says no.	Hi tgħid le.
We knew each other beforehand.	Konna nafu lil xulxin minn qabel.
I can't say what he's thinking	Ma nistax ngħid x'qed jaħseb
I will definitely go back	Żgur li se mmur lura
So it must be.	Hekk għandu jkun.
So it is done.	Hekk isir.
I couldn’t tell what he was doing	Ma stajtx ngħid x'kien qed jagħmel
Let me just try.	Ħa nipprova biss.
She was there.	Kienet hemm.
But, of course, no one thought about it.	Imma, ovvjament, ħadd ma ħaseb dwar dan.
It was too early, too early.	Kien kmieni wisq, kmieni wisq.
You should go if you are not busy.	Għandek tmur jekk m'intix okkupat.
I will definitely try this.	Żgur se nipprova dan.
He came out and really did it.	Huwa ħareġ u tassew għamel dan.
That will be a great one.	Dik se tkun waħda kbira.
Not one.	Mhux wieħed.
I’ve been here too long as it was.	Kont ilni hawn wisq kif kien.
I wonder how they are doing this	Nistaqsi kif qed jagħmlu dan
There was no need.	Ma kienx hemm għalfejn.
I know it couldn’t have been easier.	Naf li ma setax ikun faċli.
None of this.	Xejn minn dan.
That's it.	Dak hu dan.
I really wasn’t interested.	Verament ma kontx interessat.
I’ve been long enough to know when it’s not right.	Ilni biżżejjed biex inkun naf meta ma jkunx tajjeb.
I take that.	Jien nieħu dak.
I hope all was well	Jien nittama li kollox kien tajjeb
I suspect everyone and everything	Nissuspetta lil kulħadd u kollox
I can never go back	Qatt ma nista’ nerġa’ lura
He'll be back soon enough.	Huwa ser jiġi lura malajr biżżejjed.
I know too many things.	Naf wisq affarijiet.
He comes back tomorrow.	Hu ġej lura għada.
I see well.	Nara tajjeb.
As they should.	Kif għandhom.
That’s really not a lot of people.	Dak verament mhux ħafna nies.
And it would be easy.	U jkun faċli.
You will.	Inti se.
I thought you would be here	Ħsibt li inti tkun hawn
That was probably why.	Dik kien probabbilment għaliex.
Or here, another.	Jew hawn, ieħor.
No one had done this before.	Ħadd ma kien għamel dan qabel.
And not much more.	U mhux wisq aktar.
I said easy.	għidt faċli.
We have no idea what it looked like.	M’għandniex idea ta’ kif deher.
I will do this and nothing more.	Jien se nagħmel dan u xejn aktar.
I hope it helps someone.	Nispera li jgħin lil xi ħadd.
The first one on, no problem.	L-ewwel waħda fuq, l-ebda problema.
There is nothing to say.	M'hemm xejn xi ngħid.
He had a little more at home.	Huwa kellu ftit aktar id-dar.
I think they always have	Naħseb li dejjem kienu
And that was it today.	U dan kien illum.
I had to do it.	Kelli nagħmel dan.
I can definitely wait a few more hours	Żgur li nista’ nistenna ftit sigħat aktar
Well, here you go.	Ukoll, hawn tmur.
I'll tell you something	Jien ngħidlek xi ħaġa
I never thought that	Jien qatt ma ħsibt li
That was all.	Kien dan kollu.
He was still there.	Kien għadu hemm.
You will never do that.	Inti qatt mhu se tagħmel dan.
I can't talk to you right now	Ma nistax nitkellem miegħek issa
Also, no.	Barra minn hekk, le.
I would like to do that	Nixtieq nagħmel dan
Not hours ago.	Mhux sigħat ilu.
I know why I did what I did today	Naf għaliex għamilt dak li għamilt illum
Well, he can do it.	Ukoll, huwa jista 'jagħmel dan.
I was doing very well	Kont sejjer tajjeb ħafna
I wasn’t good.	Jien ma kontx tajjeb.
He saw more than that.	Huwa ra aktar minn hekk.
And she was.	U kienet kienet.
Maybe you're right.	Forsi għandek raġun.
So many years ago.	Tant snin ilu.
I want to do that	Irrid tant nagħmel hekk
I think it will do pretty well	Naħseb li se tagħmel pjuttost tajjeb
It was easy enough.	Kien faċli biżżejjed.
I have no problem with that.	M'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan.
I’m sorry to tell you.	Jiddispjaċini li jiena li ngħidlek.
I knew it was too easy	Kont naf li kien faċli wisq
I couldn't think of anything	Ma stajt naħseb xejn
I’ve been there before.	Jien kont hemm qabel.
I was thinking the same thing last night	Kont qed naħseb l-istess ħaġa lbieraħ filgħaxija
I need to do things my way	Għandi bżonn nagħmel l-affarijiet kif tiegħi
You are ready to go home.	Inti lest biex tmur id-dar.
It’s the last thing that goes.	Hija l-aħħar ħaġa li tmur.
No one wanted to talk about it.	Ħadd ma ried jitkellem dwarha.
It doesn't seem that much, does.	Ma jidhirx li ħafna, ma.
I didn’t even see it.	Jien lanqas biss rajt dan.
He came around.	Huwa daħal madwar.
I didn't even eat	Lanqas ma kont niekol
This is what happened.	Dan huwa dak li ġara.
I only knew who you were	Kont naf biss min int
I would never go back	Qatt ma kont immur lura
You can only see.	Tista 'biss tara.
You and she.	Int u hi.
If you are interested please me.	Jekk inti interessat jekk jogħġbok lili.
I just wanted to talk to you	Ridt biss nitkellem miegħek
That was wrong.	Dan kien ħażin.
I think it all started, for me	Naħseb li beda dan kollu, għalija
He knew things that no one else could know.	Kien jaf affarijiet li ħadd ma seta’ jkun jaf.
I'm still like that.	Għadni hekk.
You have to go after what you want.	Trid tmur wara dak li trid.
I have nothing.	Jien m'għandi xejn.
I love it that way !.	Inħobb hekk!.
It's too small.	Huwa żgħir wisq.
I really hope you can do that	Verament nittama li inti tista 'tagħmel dan
Maybe he could have another one.	Forsi seta’ jkollu wieħed ieħor.
We are not.	Aħna le.
This is more money for us.	Dan huwa aktar flus għalina.
Tomorrow we will be with him.	Għada nkunu miegħu.
Just for me to see	Jien biss biex nara
He had no idea how long he would live.	Ma kellux idea kemm kien se jgħix.
I thought it was a pretty good way to do that	Ħsibt li kien mod pjuttost tajjeb biex tagħmel dan
I wonder if he knows	Nistaqsi jekk jafx
But not good.	Imma mhux tajjeb.
It was afternoon.	Kien wara nofsinhar.
I can’t speak for everyone.	Ma nistax nitkellem għal kulħadd.
You have to come home.	Trid tiġi d-dar.
Definitely had to.	Żgur li kellha.
Looks like you were in a bad time	Jidher li ġejt fi żmien ħażin
And you will be so glad we did.	U inti tkun tant kuntent li għamilna.
It was too early.	Kien kmieni wisq.
I know a lot of people do.	Naf li ħafna nies jagħmlu.
I didn't know what was going on until much later	Ma kontx naf x’kien qed jiġri sa ħafna wara
Nor, it seems, could not.	Lanqas, ma jidhirx, ma setax.
Please do this.	Jekk jogħġbok, tagħmel dan.
That was just the thing.	Hekk kienu biss l-affarijiet.
I don't need anything.	M'għandi bżonn xejn.
You can see how difficult it really is.	Tista 'tara kemm huwa diffiċli verament.
Of course not.	Le ovvjament le.
I wanted to go back last night.	Ridt ilbieraħ filgħaxija lura.
I suspect this is so.	Nissuspetta li dan hu hekk.
He had a good job and many friends.	Kellu xogħol tajjeb u ħafna ħbieb.
I believe it won’t take much longer now	Nemmen li mhux se jieħu ħafna aktar żmien issa
Lately I haven’t had time for myself	Dan l-aħħar ma kellix ħin għalija
I can understand that it is difficult to do that	Kapaċi nifhem li huwa diffiċli li tagħmel dan
I just have to.	Għandi biss.
He never told me when, like.	Hu qatt ma qalli meta, bħal.
I can't say more.	Ma nistax ngħid aktar.
I knew he would be with you	Kont naf li se jkun miegħek
I would like to eat more.	Nixtieq li tiekol aktar.
But that’s not what happened.	Imma dan mhux dak li ġara.
Tired of that	Għajjien b’dan
You want to stay here.	Trid toqgħod hawn.
I had nowhere to go	Ma kelli fejn immur
He could think of nothing.	Huwa seta 'jaħseb ta' xejn.
I think he was doing.	Naħseb li kien qed jagħmel.
He was a very difficult man.	Kien raġel diffiċli ħafna.
He needed bad money.	Huwa kellu bżonn flus ħażin.
I was happy to do that.	Kont kuntent li nagħmel dan.
Everyone out for money.	Kulħadd barra għal flus.
And so it was.	U kien hekk.
And it works well.	U jaħdem tajjeb.
You were having fun.	Int kont tieħu gost.
I didn't know what was going on	Ma kontx naf x’kien qed jiġri
No, it wasn't for what he was thinking.	Le, ma kienx għal dak li kien qed jaħseb.
I will not go back	Ma kontx se nerġa’ lura
I understand these things	Nifhem dawn l-affarijiet
I have no idea, really	M'għandi l-ebda idea, tassew
I was still young.	Kont għadni żgħir.
He will not be home.	Hu mhux se jkun id-dar.
I know what you're going to say	Naf x'se tgħid
I wasn’t going too bad	Ma kontx sejjer ħażin wisq
Better do it.	Aħjar jagħmlu dan.
It didn’t have to be that big.	Ma kellux ikun daqshekk kbir.
She could be there.	Hija tista 'tkun hemm.
I believe not.	Nemmen li le.
I never took it that way.	Jien qatt ma kont nieħu hekk.
That's a good thing.	Dik hija ħaġa tajba.
She looks very beautiful.	Hija tidher sabiħa ħafna.
Maybe very quickly.	Forsi malajr ħafna.
I can't talk to him	Ma nista’ nitkellem miegħu xejn
This will not happen.	Dan mhux se jiġri.
Here's something wrong.	Hawn xi ħaġa ħażina.
Nobody can do anything.	Ħadd ma jista’ jagħmel xejn.
I know it might just be about tonight	Naf li jista 'jkun biss dwar illejla
I know too well how good you are.	Naf wisq tajjeb kemm int tajjeb.
But that could be just me.	Imma dak jista 'jkun biss jien.
I still think about it.	Għadni naħseb dwarha.
He, of course, did so.	Huwa, ovvjament, għamel hekk.
You know it always will.	Taf li dejjem se.
I need everyone there	Għandi bżonn kulħadd hemm
I didn’t know exactly how it was going to happen	Ma kontx naf eżatt kif se jiġri
It can’t happen here.	Ma jistax jiġri hawn.
I still couldn't believe it was him	Għadni ma stajtx nemmen li kien hu
I have some time.	Għandi ftit ħin.
Now it’s just both.	Issa huwa biss it-tnejn.
There was never enough.	Qatt ma kien hemm biżżejjed.
And they are all friends.	U huma kollha ħbieb.
It’s about something good.	Huwa fuq xi ħaġa tajba.
I was trying to do something nice for you	Kont qed nipprova nagħmel xi ħaġa sabiħa għalik
I have this all the time.	Għandi dan il-ħin kollu.
I want you to eat as much as you can	Irrid li tiekol kemm tista’
I need to be with him	Għandi bżonn inkun miegħu
But too many were.	Imma wisq kienu.
I didn’t have to go.	Ma kellix għalfejn immur.
I need your help.	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
You are mine.	Inti tiegħi.
He is not sure how long ago.	Huwa mhux ċert kemm ilu.
I need this more than anything	Għandi bżonn dan aktar minn kull ħaġa
But here, nothing.	Imma hawn, xejn.
I need to know more	Ikolli bżonn inkun naf aktar
And here we are again.	U hawn aħna mill-ġdid.
You know everyone.	Taf lil kulħadd.
That was out.	Dak kien barra.
A little good, actually	Ftit tajjeb, fil-fatt
Much more was happening than it seems	Kien qed jiġri ħafna aktar milli jidher
I have to say so.	Ikolli ngħid hekk.
Being able to do such things.	Li tkun kapaċi tagħmel affarijiet bħal dawn.
We do work that needs to be done here.	Nagħmlu xogħol li jrid isir hawn.
But some things you should know.	Imma xi affarijiet li għandek tkun taf.
I don’t know how much.	Ma nafx kemm.
We don’t have much time.	M'għandniex ħafna ħin.
I may be the last	Jista' jkun li nkun l-aħħar
We do better when we know better.	Nagħmlu aħjar meta nafu aħjar.
I am supposed to know everything.	Suppost li naf kollox.
There was no one to see.	Ma kien hemm ħadd jara.
It definitely won't come	Żgur li mhux se jiġi
That is what remains.	Dan hu li jibqa’.
More than that please.	Aktar minn dan jekk jogħġbok.
Looks like someone died.	Qisu miet xi ħadd.
I never talk about it with anyone	Jien qatt ma nitkellem dwarha ma’ ħadd
I was scared	Kont qed nibża’
This is not a time for that.	Dan mhux żmien għal dak.
And she was the first.	U hi kienet l-ewwel.
Everyone here knew about it.	Kull min kien hawn kien jaf b’dan.
It goes so fast.	Imur daqshekk malajr.
Not for now.	Mhux għal issa.
I can’t really see that happening.	Ma nistax verament nara li jiġri.
Probably years.	Probabbilment snin.
Apparently he couldn’t do that.	Jidher li ma setax jagħmel dan.
I can't even speak	Lanqas nista’ nitkellem
Until recently this is.	Sa ftit ilu dan hu.
I knew exactly who she was	Kont naf eżatt min kienet
There is really little more to say.	Hemm verament ftit aktar xi ngħid.
I was there to eat.	Kont hemm biex niekol.
She is too scared.	Hija wisq jibża.
I’m telling you the truth.	Qed ngħidlek il-verità.
You know, about what I said last night.	Taf, dwar dak li għidt ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
I just know he was there.	Naf biss li kien hemm.
That will happen.	Dak se jiġri.
I didn’t have time for either	Ma kellix ħin għal lanqas
I’m trying something harder than ever.	Qed nipprova xi ħaġa aktar diffiċli minn qatt qabel.
What you want to do for you is there.	Dak li trid tagħmel għalik qiegħed hemm.
No one came to the door.	Ħadd ma ġie lejn il-bieb.
This should be so.	Dan għandu jkun hekk.
I hope they do.	Nispera li jagħmlu.
I have to do another	Ikolli nagħmel ieħor
He could see no one about.	Huwa seta 'jara lil ħadd dwar.
I did it.	Għamilt dan.
This seems very likely.	Dan jidher probabbli ħafna.
I thought this would be a good time for him.	Ħsibt li dan ikun żmien tajjeb għalih.
I need to get back home	Għandi bżonn nerġa’ lura d-dar tiegħi
What, it is.	X'inhu, huwa.
We had almost nothing.	Kellna kważi xejn.
.	.
Of course I didn't hear	Ovvjament ma kontx nisma’
It was late afternoon.	Kien tard wara nofsinhar.
Anyone can say that.	Kulħadd jista’ jgħid hekk.
I did it all on my own	Jien għamilt dan kollu waħdi
Great big big.	Kbir kbir kbir.
I can't tell you what will happen	Ma nistax ngħidlek x'se jiġri
There is little else we can do.	Ftit ieħor nistgħu nagħmlu.
I can tell what you're thinking.	Nista' ngħid x'qed taħseb.
This is more the same.	Dan huwa aktar l-istess.
She says she doesn't want that.	Tgħid li ma tridx hekk.
It’s actually not too bad.	Huwa fil-fatt mhux ħażin wisq.
I didn’t have much to say about it	Ma kellix wisq xi ngħid dwarha
I don't know exactly.	Ma nafx eżatt.
That was not easy.	Dak ma kienx faċli.
Not a chance for that.	Mhux ċans ta’ dan.
I thought he would never come back	Ħsibt li qatt ma kien ġej lura
It's not there.	Mhuwiex hemm.
How do we do it, of course.	Kif nagħmlu, ovvjament.
I couldn't tell where	Ma stajtx ngħid fejn
I’m ready for anything.	Jien lest għal xi ħaġa.
I had better do it myself	Kont aħjar nagħmel dan jien
I'm sure he is.	Jien ċert li hu.
I’m pretty sure about that	Jiena pjuttost ċert dwar dan
I’m a very, very good boy.	Jien tifel tajjeb ħafna, ħafna.
One at a time.	Wieħed kull darba.
I wanted to do the same	Jien ridt nagħmel l-istess
It's not good.	Mhuwiex tajjeb.
Not for everyone.	Mhux għal kulħadd.
I want to see what he sees	Irrid nara dak li jara
I had to figure out how to do it better	Kelli nifhem kif nagħmel aħjar
It was not there.	Ma kienx hemm.
Do you think you have what it takes ?.	Taħseb li għandek dak li hemm bżonn?.
It’s not what you say but how you say it.	Mhuwiex dak li tgħid imma kif tgħid dan.
He wanted everything.	Ried kollox.
How do I do that.	Kif nagħmel dan.
Alone.	Waħdu.
I think I feel sorry for myself.	Naħseb li jiddispjaċini għalija.
It may not be.	Jista 'ma jkunx.
I know where it comes from.	Naf minn fejn ġej.
But no one is right.	Imma ħadd ma għandu raġun.
That can be helpful.	Li jista 'jkun ta' għajnuna.
No one came out.	Ħadd ma ħareġ.
This is what happened to me.	Dan huwa dak li ġara lili.
I didn’t want to go.	Ma ridtx immur.
That’s what you came here for.	Huwa dak li ġejt hawn.
What's going on ?.	X'qed jiġri?.
She knew how difficult it was to do.	Kienet taf kemm kien diffiċli li tagħmel.
He told me how they felt.	Huwa qalli kif ħassu.
That was pretty sure.	Dan kien pjuttost ċert.
I couldn’t take this anymore	Ma stajtx nieħu dan aktar
Just a little earlier.	Ftit ftit qabel.
One year later and one year out.	Sena wara u sena barra.
I eat well.	niekol tajjeb.
I just didn’t want to believe it	Jien biss ma ridtx nemmen
I'm sure of it.	Jiena ċert minn dan.
I was not surprised by this	Ma kontx sorpriż b'dan
I thought how many people there were	Ħsibt kemm kien hemm nies
I can do this, no problem	Nista' nagħmel dan, l-ebda problema
I only have this	Għandi biss din
He took it back.	Huwa ħa lura.
I can't think so	Ma nistax naħseb hekk
Now he has to.	Issa għandu.
No he wasn't.	Le hu ma kienx.
I know you wouldn't.	Naf li inti ma tkunx.
I knew it was me, always me	Kont naf li kont jien, dejjem jien
I didn’t know when or how it would happen	Ma kontx naf meta jew kif se jiġri
It should work well for you as well.	Għandu jaħdem tajjeb għalik ukoll.
I can do one or the other.	Kapaċi nagħmel waħda jew oħra.
It would always come.	Kien ikun dejjem ġej.
Making a friend.	Nagħmlu ħabib.
I think too often.	Naħseb spiss wisq.
I think it will.	Naħseb li se.
I think it would be more likely.	Għandi naħseb li jkun aktar probabbli.
When he arrived.	Meta wasal.
It just didn’t happen.	Huwa biss ma ġara.
Usually this is not a good idea.	Normalment din mhix idea tajba.
I'm going to the first thing in the morning	Jien se l-ewwel ħaġa filgħodu
She was nothing.	Hija kienet xejn.
I thought I was someone else.	Ħsibt li kont xi ħadd ieħor.
he said.	hu qal.
But it didn’t have to be him.	Imma ma kellux ikun hu.
I didn’t want to go and I said so	Ma ridtx immur u għidt hekk
I can't take it anymore	Ma nistax nieħu aktar
No one could see anything.	Ħadd ma seta’ jara xi ħaġa.
He said to tell me.	Qal li tgħidli.
I’m one thing, and nothing more.	Jien ħaġa waħda, u xejn aktar.
He has his.	Huwa għandu tiegħu.
I haven't done anything in a long time	Ilni ma nagħmel xejn
Many times.	Ħafna drabi.
There is nothing more you can do.	M'hemm xejn aktar li tista 'tagħmel.
No, not all of them.	Le, mhux kollha kemm huma.
I will try to be.	Se nipprova nkun.
And that can’t be too bad, can it ?.	U dan ma jistax ikun ħażin wisq, hux?.
I wasn’t very happy.	Ma kontx ferħan ħafna.
It could be you too.	Jista 'jkun ukoll int.
No, that's too far back.	Le, dak huwa wisq lura.
I have to be able to.	Għandi nkun kapaċi.
I won't, ever again	Jien mhux se, qatt aktar
I want to take some time out of that little bit.	Irrid nieħu ftit ħin minn dak li ftit.
I only do that with you	Nagħmel hekk miegħek biss
Wherever he wants.	Kull fejn irid.
It's a bit.	Huwa daqsxejn.
I didn’t have to do too much	Ma kellix għalfejn nagħmel wisq
I wish it wasn’t so.	Nixtieq li ma kienx hekk.
I never thought otherwise	Qatt ma ħsibt mod ieħor
You should know, you’ve been there.	Għandek tkun taf, inti kont hemm.
I need to do that.	Għandi bżonn li tagħmel dan.
I enjoy shopping now	Jien nieħu gost nixtri issa
I always do.	Jien dejjem.
I know you have something	Naf li għandek xi ħaġa
I often wonder what he is doing now.	Spiss nistaqsi x’qed jagħmel issa.
I didn’t want him to leave	Ma ridtx li jitlaq
I think a lot of people do	Naħseb li ħafna nies jagħmlu
I know it wasn't easy for you	Naf li ma kienx faċli għalik
I can't tell you anymore	Ma nistax ngħidlek aktar
It was easier for him.	Kien aktar faċli għalih.
It's everything.	Huwa kollox.
This all works well.	Dan kollu jaħdem tajjeb.
Which she sure is.	Li hi żgur.
I came here to tell you the truth	Ġejt hawn biex ngħidlek il-verità
There it was, too.	Kien hemm, ukoll.
It could have been later.	Seta’ kien wara.
I'm not going to do anything for you	Jien mhu se nagħmel xejn għalik
Very good.	Tajjeb ħafna.
Now more than ever, you want to be there for each other.	Issa aktar minn qatt qabel, trid tkun hemm għal xulxin.
For this and that only.	Għal dan u dan biss.
Truly, there is only one person.	Tassew, ikun hemm persuna waħda biss.
It’s too late for me, now.	Huwa tard wisq għalija, issa.
I could see he was home	Stajt nara li kien id-dar
And they were friends.	U kienu ħbieb.
I wonder what it was all about	Nistaqsi dak li kien kollu dwar
It will definitely come.	Żgur li se jiġi.
I will be with you.	Jien inkun miegħek.
And as it looks today.	U kif jidher illum.
If it wasn't.	Jekk ma kienx.
It may be too late tonight.	Illejla jista’ jkun tard wisq.
You and I are both.	Int u jien it-tnejn.
A very long time ago really	Żmien twil ħafna ilu tassew
More than anything.	Aktar minn kollox.
You will be happy.	Int tkun kuntent.
I wanted to tell you, but I was out	Ridt ngħidlek, imma kont barra
I didn't have much time	Ma tantx kelli ħin
I wasn’t expecting any of this	Ma kont qed nistenna xejn minn dan
As she did.	Kif għamlet hi.
I’m not the only one	Jien mhux l-uniku wieħed
I said too much.	Kont għedt wisq.
The, the.	Le, le.
I’m not trying to say anything.	Jien ma nipprova ngħid xejn.
Who knew what was going on.	Min kien jaf x’qed jiġri.
I have never heard of this before.	Qatt ma smajt b'dan qabel.
Well, that's it.	Ukoll, dak huwa.
I couldn't do anything	Ma stajt nagħmel xejn
And I believe I do the same.	U nemmen li nagħmel l-istess.
I'm glad you're okay	Jien kuntent li int tajjeb
There is something else, too.	Hemm xi ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
I can’t believe you had the time	Ma nistax nemmen li kellek il-ħin
I’m not just doing that.	Jien mhux biss qed nagħmel dan.
He is very happy.	Huwa kuntent ħafna.
I won’t be out there, either	Mhux se nkun hemm barra, lanqas
He did so.	Hekk għamel.
I think you should.	Naħseb li għandek.
I never did anything	Qatt ma kont nagħmel xejn
Maybe not even him.	Forsi lanqas hu.
I didn't stand a chance	Ma kellix ċans
But there was more.	Imma kien hemm aktar.
I don't want any help.	Ma rrid l-ebda għajnuna.
I don't understand	Jien ma nifhem
I just know it happened	Naf biss li ġara
I needed help	Kelli bżonn nieħu għajnuna
I hope, very much, that everything goes well	Nispera, ħafna, li kollox imur tajjeb
And a great friend.	U ħabib kbir.
I just want you to talk to me about it	Nixtieq biss li titkellem miegħi dwarha
This is really long ago.	Dan huwa verament twil ilu.
I am none of these.	Jiena xejn minn dawn.
Yesterday wasn’t so good either.	Ilbieraħ ma kienx daqshekk tajjeb lanqas.
You should know.	Għandek tkun taf.
This is supposed to be a good thing.	Din suppost tkun xi ħaġa tajba.
I didn't think I could do that	Ma kontx naħseb li seta’ jagħmel dan
I didn’t know things	Ma kontx naf affarijiet
A man in need of help.	Raġel li għandu bżonn l-għajnuna.
You were a boy.	Inti kont tifel.
This is not so.	Dan mhux hekk.
I wonder how much he has	Nistaqsi kemm għandu
I must have done something.	I għandu għamilt xi ħaġa.
Not great, not bad.	Mhux kbir, mhux ħażin.
To do so.	Biex tagħmel hekk.
So he says on the door.	Hekk jgħid fuq il-bieb.
Too big for one or the other.	Kbir wisq għal wieħed jew ieħor.
This is my friend.	Dan huwa ħabib tiegħi.
I surprised everyone	I sorpriż lil kulħadd
It works every time.	Jaħdem kull darba.
I was now all alone	I issa kont kollha waħdi
Just a little.	Ftit biss.
I can't be.	Ma nistax inkun.
I just believe that.	Jien biss nemmen li.
I'm watching and listening	Qed nara u nisma’
Often it is.	Ħafna drabi huwa.
Lots of time.	Ħafna ħin.
Not like a man.	Mhux bħal raġel.
It was a little over.	Kien ftit fuq.
I try not to but it just seems to happen	Nipprova ma imma jidher li jiġri biss
That was the first time.	Dik kienet l-ewwel darba.
I can never tell you how much.	Qatt ma nista’ ngħidlek kemm.
I needed to know how much time had passed	Kelli bżonn inkun naf kemm għadda żmien
It looks really good to us	Jidher qisu tassew tajjeb għalina
That was it.	Dan kellu jkun.
I wanted to know how you are	Ridt inkun naf kif int
You must go, he said.	Int trid tmur, qal.
Maybe this would be easier for you.	Forsi dan ikun aktar faċli għalik.
I'm here for you.	Jien hawn għalik.
I hope it will be before long	Nispera li se qabel twil
We had to know.	Kellna nkunu nafu.
I did this and it works well	Għamilt dan u jaħdem tajjeb
You just have to do it yourself	Inti biss għandek tagħmel inti
He was so good to us.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb magħna.
I have to go home now	Ikolli mmur id-dar issa
I can't say.	Ma nistax ngħid.
This is it.	Dan hu.
This was no problem.	Din ma kienet l-ebda problema.
Like it’s too hard to say more.	Bħal huwa diffiċli wisq biex ngħid aktar.
But it’s not working yet.	Imma għadu mhux qed jaħdem.
If he does nothing.	Jekk jagħmel xejn.
Better be.	Aħjar ikun.
You will be happy again, believe me.	Int tkun kuntent mill-ġdid, nemmen lili.
Well, it should.	Ukoll, għandu.
It is not very difficult.	Mhuwiex diffiċli ħafna.
I’ve never seen anything like that	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal dik
I know how busy you want to be	Naf kemm trid tkun okkupat
I need to go so far	Għandi bżonn immur daqshekk
I would be back.	Inkun lura.
I want to know what's going on	Irrid inkun naf x'qed jiġri
I knew I was coming	Kont naf li ġejt
Probably not great.	Probabbilment mhux kbir.
I'll tell you everything	Jien ngħidlek kollox
It could have been really bad.	Seta’ kien tassew ħażin.
I still can't understand this	Għadni ma nistax nifhem dan
Only one problem.	Problema waħda biss.
I'm really sorry you know	Jien tassew jiddispjaċini taf
But it is the same thing.	Imma hija l-istess ħaġa.
I was, really.	Jien kont, tassew.
And I'm so tired.	U jien tant għajjien.
I wanted to know who that was	Ridt inkun naf min kien dak
I do things my way, not yours	Nagħmel l-affarijiet kif tiegħi, mhux tiegħek
In fact, no, that was not the case.	Fil-fatt, le, dan ma kienx jiġri.
I want to have some fun	Irrid nieħu ftit gost
If she had any.	Kieku kellha xi.
So easy.	Faċli daqshekk.
I just want to be with you tonight	Irrid inkun miegħek illejla biss
I did what I did.	Għamilt dak li għamilt.
I was just a little boy	Kont biss tifel żgħir
I didn't want that.	Ma ridtx hekk.
It was always there.	Dejjem kien hemm.
And as he is.	U kif hu.
I want to know exactly where you are	Irrid inkun naf eżatt fejn int
But you are not.	Imma m'intix.
And that’s another thing.	U dik hija ħaġa oħra.
It's easy.	Huwa faċli.
It was too late to do anything, of course.	Kien tard wisq biex tagħmel xi ħaġa, ovvjament.
He was no longer afraid.	Ma kienx jibża aktar.
I will be back soon	Se nkun lura dalwaqt
No one said that.	Ħadd ma qal dan.
You never know, something might go wrong there.	Qatt ma tkun taf, xi ħaġa tista’ tmur ħażin hemmhekk.
I need to hear about it.	Għandi bżonn nisma dwar dan.
That's my job.	Dak hu xogħol tiegħi.
I love every bit of it	Inħobb kull daqsxejn ta’ dan
You will make good money.	Int ser tagħmel flus tajba.
I definitely can't go back there	Żgur li ma nistax immur lura hemm
I know better than that.	Naf aħjar milli nagħmel hekk.
Not all maybe, but many.	Mhux kollha forsi, imma ħafna.
I should know these things.	Għandi naf dawn l-affarijiet.
I didn't think much of it	Ma tantx ħsibt
I have never seen this.	Qatt ma rajt dan.
I was almost out	Kont kważi barra
In fact.	Fil-fatt.
As you wish.	Kif trid.
I hope it helps.	Nispera li jgħin.
I'm happy for you	Jien kuntent għalik
Well, that's it.	Tajjeb, dan hu.
I'm doing the work.	Qed nagħmel ix-xogħol.
I was a little happy, and a little worried	Kont ftit ferħan, u ftit inkwetat
I knew what was going on	Kont naf x’kien qed jiġri
I couldn't do anything	Ma stajt nagħmel xejn
But you do.	Imma int tagħmel.
I'll go before tomorrow.	Jien ser immur qabel għada.
That was good for me.	Li kien tajjeb minni.
Or the next one.	Jew dik ta’ wara.
I think that was it	Naħseb li kien hekk
I was just surprised.	Kont biss sorpriż.
You don’t have to go together.	M'għandekx għalfejn tmur flimkien.
It wasn’t that he didn’t want to.	Ma kienx li hu ma riedx.
I don’t know how that happened	Ma nafx kif ġara dan
Which he is not.	Li hu mhux.
I thought no one could be there	Ħsibt li ħadd ma jista’ jkun hemm
Not so hard either.	Lanqas daqshekk diffiċli.
It cannot be returned.	Ma jistax jiġi lura.
I said everything.	għidt kollox.
It does.	Dan jagħmel.
I hope it always will	Nittama li dejjem se
It should be that not easy to do.	Għandu jkun li mhux faċli li tagħmel.
I had to think of something.	Kelli naħseb xi ħaġa.
I have time to think	Għandi ħin naħseb
There it was, there it was.	Kien hemm, hemm eżatt.
He was ready to go.	Kien lest biex imur.
I know it will happen.	Naf li se jiġri.
It takes one.	Huwa jieħu wieħed.
Something was happening there.	Hemmhekk kien qed jiġri xi ħaġa.
I need time alone with you	Għandi bżonn ħin waħdi miegħek
It wasn’t bad.	Ma kienx ħażin.
I want to know what it is	Irrid inkun naf x'inhu
He came out.	Huwa ħareġ.
I was definitely not a good person	Żgur li ma kontx persuna tajba
She really had done it.	Hija verament kienet għamlet dan.
But it can’t be both.	Imma ma tistax tkun it-tnejn.
It would be easier.	Ikun aktar faċli.
And so it is for us.	U hekk ukoll għalina.
I've never been with a boy	Qatt ma kont ma’ tifel
I'm coming with you.	Jien ġej miegħek.
I have no idea what's going on	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'qed jiġri
Not about one man.	Mhux dwar raġel wieħed.
And maybe other people.	U forsi nies oħra.
Okay, a lot.	Tajjeb, ħafna.
There were so many people.	Kien hemm ħafna nies hekk.
It's better now.	Hija aħjar issa.
I have all the same problems	Għandi l-istess problemi kollha
He thought that.	Huwa ħaseb li.
This will be very soon.	Dan se jkun malajr ħafna.
And he was another man.	U kien raġel ieħor.
No one had seen any of this.	Ħadd ma kien ra xi ħaġa minn dan.
Well in fact that's about it.	Ukoll fil-fatt li dwar dan.
It may never be.	Jista’ jkun li qatt ma jkun.
But it's not working.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem.
I understand that should be pretty good	Nifhem li għandu jkun pjuttost tajjeb
I should probably go home	Probabbilment għandi mmur id-dar
It has already happened.	Diġà ġara.
I was there.	Jien kont hemm.
He couldn't stand it anymore.	Ma setax joqgħod aktar.
A man came out.	Ħareġ raġel.
It's one or the other.	Huwa wieħed jew ieħor.
You know what you want.	Taf xi trid.
I want you to tell me	Irrid li tgħidli
You know, you can go in the evening.	Taf, tista’ tmur filgħaxija tiegħek.
I said it was almost there	Għidt li kien kważi hemm
We both know it's not right.	It-tnejn nafu li mhux tajjeb.
I thought it was really good.	Ħsibt li kien tassew tajjeb.
Maybe he was just tired.	Forsi kien biss għajjien.
I still couldn’t believe he was with me	Għadni ma stajtx nemmen li kien miegħi
I knew he didn’t want to be there	Kont naf li ma riedx ikun hemm
I’m trying to do better	Qed nipprova nagħmel aħjar
And well you don’t.	U tajjeb m'għandekx.
I never told anyone about it	Qatt ma għedt lil ħadd dwarha
I hope there is.	Nispera li jkun hemm.
I had never thought of it before	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha hekk qabel
I'm very happy here.	Jien kuntent ħafna hawn.
I will be a good boy.	Jien se nkun tifel tajjeb.
You must be better than one man.	Trid tkun aħjar minn raġel wieħed.
I knew it was too easy	Kont naf li kien faċli wisq
It really was great.	Huwa verament kien kbir.
I've never seen anything before	Qatt ma rajt xejn qabel
I thought that was all.	Ħsibt li kien kollox.
I made my time.	Għamilt il-ħin tiegħi.
You are the first.	Int l-ewwel.
I didn’t really think about it	Jien ma tantx ħsibt dwarha
It was hard to see.	Kien diffiċli biex jara.
I think you will be really interested	Naħseb li tkun verament interessat
He doesn’t seem to know exactly where he’s going.	Jidher li ma jafx eżatt fejn sejjer.
Only that is one.	Biss li hija waħda.
I didn’t need to know this.	Ma kellix bżonn inkun naf dan.
I didn’t want to do any of that	Jien ma ridtx nagħmel xejn minn hekk
I think maybe it could happen.	Naħseb li forsi jista' jiġri.
I’m like this, actually	Jien bħal dan, fil-fatt
She never had to.	Hija qatt ma kellha.
I just wanted to know what was going on here	Ridt biss nifhem x’kien qed jiġri hawn
We will do everything we can.	Aħna se nagħmlu dak kollu li nistgħu.
I don’t want to go there again	Ma rridx immur hemm mill-ġdid
I think someone told me something.	Naħseb li xi ħadd qalli xi ħaġa.
To know that you need these.	Li tkun taf li għandek bżonn dawn.
It wasn’t a big deal for me.	Huwa kien le kbir għalija.
I need some help for this.	Għandi bżonn xi għajnuna għal dan.
I’ve been there many times	Jien kont hemm ħafna drabi
It's really not difficult.	Huwa verament mhux diffiċli.
I wasn’t even sure if it was going to work	Lanqas kont ċert jekk kienx se jaħdem
I couldn't go to work or school anymore	Ma stajtx immur aktar ix-xogħol jew l-iskola
It was easy for me.	Kien faċli għalija.
I never thought it was so bad	Qatt ma ħsibt li kien daqshekk ħażin
I have no money problems	M'għandix problemi ta' flus
But not so fast.	Imma mhux daqshekk malajr.
One was a boy.	Wieħed kien tifel.
You still don’t know anything, but you know you know nothing.	Għadu ma taf xejn, imma taf li ma taf xejn.
I sit down a little longer	Noqgħod bilqiegħda ftit aktar
I think we would be fine	Naħseb li nkunu tajjeb
I never had a problem	Qatt ma kelli problema
And that was him.	U dak kien hu.
I think they do	Naħseb li jagħmlu dan
I had no idea who he was	Ma kellix idea min kien
Now they are.	Issa huma.
I heard about what happened	Smajt dwar dak li ġara
I know that too well	Naf li wisq tajjeb
I had no idea what was going to happen	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'se jiġri
I didn’t have a job.	Jien ma kellix xogħol.
You shouldn’t, you shouldn’t, you shouldn’t.	M'għandekx, m'għandekx, m'għandekx.
I think there is someone for everyone	Naħseb li hemm xi ħadd għal kulħadd
I love this school.	Inħobb din l-iskola.
A man she hardly knew	Raġel li ma tantx kienet taf
If nothing goes wrong.	Jekk xejn ma jmur ħażin.
She was sitting.	Kienet bilqiegħda.
I couldn’t do a little more	Jien ma stajt nagħmel ftit aktar
Everything will be great.	Kollox se jkun kbir.
I'm getting better.	Jien sejjer aħjar.
Just something about it.	Biss xi ħaġa dwarha.
I have to say this	Irrid ngħid dan
He never sat down.	Hu qatt ma kien joqgħod bilqiegħda.
Well next week.	Ukoll il-ġimgħa d-dieħla.
Everything there was there.	Kollox kien hemm kien hemm.
He probably wasn't.	Huwa probabbilment ma kienx.
It can take years of work.	Jista 'jieħu snin ta' xogħol.
But nothing came.	Imma xejn ma ġie.
I know, I didn’t want that	Naf, ma ridtx dan
So far, I've done everything I can.	Sa issa, għamilt dak kollu li tista’.
She wants to do something before it's too late.	Hija trid tagħmel xi ħaġa qabel ma jkun tard wisq.
He took one.	Huwa ħa wieħed.
We are so.	Aħna hekk.
Not me, no.	Mhux jien, le.
I can’t count on that	Ma nistax noqgħod fuq dan
I doubt it will happen	Niddubita li jiġri
I was so scared.	Kont tant nibża.
I didn’t even have any more	Lanqas kelli aktar
I was just a kid, nobody told me anything	Kont biss tifel, ħadd ma qalli xejn
That was another man.	Dak kien raġel ieħor.
But it is not so.	Imma mhux hekk tagħmel dan.
All too fast.	Kollha malajr wisq.
There you are.	Hemm int.
Neither are you.	Lanqas int.
I was sure it was him	Kont ċert li kien hu
I believe I will be there.	Nemmen li nkun hemm.
It was easy to see.	Kien faċli biex tara.
I didn’t listen, but it was hard not to listen	Ma kontx nisma, imma kien diffiċli li ma nisma
In fact, we can't.	Fil-fatt, ma nistgħux.
I was telling you so.	Jien kont qed ngħidlek hekk.
I have already done it for all of me	Diġà għamilt għal tiegħi kollha
I’m not too sure about that myself.	Jien mhux wisq ċert dwar dan jien.
She wants more.	Hija trid aktar.
That you want to be alone.	Li trid tkun waħdek.
I was you.	Kont int.
I’m so much more than that.	Jien ħafna aktar minn hekk.
And now, we know.	U issa, nafu.
Maybe that’s what they both need.	Forsi huwa dak li għandhom bżonn it-tnejn.
If there is no better way, it will.	Jekk ma jkunx hemm mod aħjar, se tagħmel.
He is here now and here he must remain.	Huwa hawn issa u hawn hu għandu jibqa '.
Not a big deal.	Mhix xi ħaġa kbira.
But it’s not your problem.	Imma mhix il-problema tiegħek.
I couldn't see how I could	Ma stajtx nara kif seta’
Maybe it’s the only way.	Forsi huwa l-uniku mod.
I don’t know why this should have happened.	Ma nafx għaliex għandu ġara dan.
That wasn’t a problem either.	Dik lanqas ma kienet problema.
He did something.	Huwa għamel xi ħaġa.
You can't tell.	Ma tistax tgħid.
I hadn’t even heard of it	Lanqas ma kont smajt
I’m not saying it can’t be done.	Mhux qed ngħid li ma jistax isir.
That started.	Dak beda.
Maybe a lot, maybe a little.	Forsi ħafna, forsi ftit.
That wasn’t very long.	Li ma tantx kien twil.
I thought you.	Ħsibt li inti.
In fact.	Fil-fatt.
I was sure of it	Jien kont ċert dwar dan
And it probably will.	U x'aktarx se.
I think you're talking there	Naħseb li int qed jitkellem hemmhekk
I was very scared.	Kont nibża’ ħafna.
I know it can't be easy	Naf li ma jistax ikun faċli
He knew she had to.	Kien jaf li kellha.
Never, never will be.	Qatt ma, qatt mhu se jkun.
I have never seen your car	Qatt ma rajt il-karozza tiegħek
Or anyone can.	Jew xi ħadd jista '.
Everything is not right with you.	Kollox mhux tajjeb miegħek.
I haven't been here that long	Jien lanqas ilni hawn daqshekk
But all that comes.	Imma dak kollu li ġej.
I wonder if it really works.	Nistaqsi jekk tassew jaħdem.
It has everything.	Għandu kollox.
It will happen again.	Se jerġa’ jiġri.
You are right to be tired.	Għandek raġun li tkun għajjien.
But she knew that before she said so.	Imma hi kienet taf li qabel ma qal hekk.
I just thought you should know	Ħsibt biss li għandek tkun taf
If not, there may be problems.	Jekk le, jista 'jkun hemm problemi.
That wasn’t so with me.	Dak ma kienx hekk miegħi.
They are.	Huma.
I'm going now.	Immur issa.
I was what he wanted	Jien kont dak li ried
I’m always alone, really alone	Jien dejjem waħdi, tassew waħdi
This may just be me.	Dan jista 'jkun biss jien.
It should work well.	Għandu jaħdem tajjeb.
I don’t want to do anything else.	Ma nixtieq nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
And me.	U jien.
Maybe not.	Forsi mhux.
Not today.	Mhux illum.
I'm with you.	Jien miegħek.
It will not be easy for you.	Mhux se jkun faċli għalik.
It actually happened.	Fil-fatt ġara.
I keep thinking about what’s to come	Noqgħod naħseb dwar dak li ġej
This will take a while.	Dan se jieħu ftit.
I wonder why it is so	Nistaqsi għaliex hu hekk
I need to stay behind	Għandi bżonn noqgħod wara
I haven’t seen anything like this.	Jien ma rajt xejn bħal dan.
That time too.	Dak iż-żmien ukoll.
To each other.	Lil xulxin.
That was good for me	Dan kien tajjeb miegħi
It must be great.	Għandu jkun kbir.
I didn’t know why he did that	Ma kontx naf għaliex għamel hekk
Or maybe he had.	Jew forsi kellu.
I didn't even have money	Lanqas flus ma kelli
No way, boy.	L-ebda mod, tifel.
You could tell she was once pretty.	Tista' tgħid li darba kienet pjuttost sabiħa.
Now everyone has done many other things.	Issa kulħadd għamel ħafna affarijiet oħra.
It just has to happen.	Irid jiġri biss.
He’s not a bad man, really.	Huwa mhux raġel ħażin, tassew.
I want to be there for you.	Irrid inkun hemm għalik.
I can't wait to go shopping	Ma nistax nistenna li mmur nixtri
Not hard, just long.	Mhux diffiċli, biss twil.
But there is none of this now.	Imma m'hemm xejn minn dan issa.
But someone was in the room with me.	Imma xi ħadd kien fil-kamra miegħi.
It wasn't so much.	Ma kienx daqshekk.
It did not appear.	Ma deherx.
I want to try that someday	Irrid nipprova dak xi darba
I don't think so.	Ma naħsibx hekk.
I didn't know what to say	Ma kontx naf x’qed tgħid
I'm a boy.	Jien tifel.
You are everything.	Inti kollox.
I am enjoying this	Qed nieħu gost b'dan
I really didn't know what to say	Verament ma kontx naf x'se ngħid
All the time.	Il-ħin kollu.
You did nothing.	Inti ma għamilt xejn.
If you wish.	Jekk tixtieq.
She was so good.	Hija kienet daqshekk tajba.
I'm not.	Jien mhux.
I think you already know why	Naħseb li diġà taf għaliex
I was here all the time	Kont hawn il-ħin kollu
If you know, you know.	Jekk taf, taf.
Or maybe it wasn’t him.	Jew forsi ma kienx hu.
I can do better	Nista’ nagħmel xi ħaġa aħjar
I wish it had happened more often	Nixtieq li ġara aktar spiss
I haven't been there in a long time	Ilni ma kontx hemm
And for you too, of course.	U għalik ukoll, ovvjament.
I can't have that.	Ma nistax ikolli dak.
But even that wasn’t enough.	Imma lanqas dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
I think you are right.	Naħseb li għandek raġun.
I just have to think a little bit about it	Ikolli biss naħseb ftit dwarha
But that was not his problem.	Imma dik ma kinitx il-problema tiegħu.
I'm fine with that.	Jien tajjeb ma 'dak.
I almost knew what it was	Kważi kont naf x’kien
And now I'm on.	U issa jien fuq.
I would be waiting outside.	Inkun qed nistenna barra.
They really were.	Kienu tassew.
I'm really happy.	Jien tassew kuntent.
I really don’t want to know.	Verament ma rridx inkun naf.
There was not enough time.	Ma kienx hemm biżżejjed ħin.
I want to do these things	Irrid nagħmel dawn l-affarijiet
And not just me.	U mhux jien biss.
Nothing out there today does that.	Xejn hemmhekk illum ma jagħmel dan.
As we have.	Hekk kif għandna.
It has everything a person could want.	Għandu dak kollu li persuna tista’ tixtieq għalih.
I am doing this now	Qed nagħmel dan issa
I wasn’t going to do that	Jien ma kontx se nagħmel dan
That was still a long time, but it was time to go.	Dak kien għadu ħafna ħin, imma kien wasal iż-żmien biex tmur.
It was after.	Kien wara.
And there it was.	U kien hemm.
Together, of course.	Flimkien, ovvjament.
I doubt he will be surprised	Niddubita li se jkun sorpriż
So he was going to make things easier.	Hekk kien se jagħmel l-affarijiet aktar faċli.
I couldn't hear anything	Ma stajt nisma’ xejn
I love what we do here	Inħobb dak li nagħmlu hawn
Too much, actually.	Wisq, fil-fatt.
He will be there until tomorrow morning.	Hu jkun hemm sa għada filgħodu.
This was not working.	Dan ma kienx qed jaħdem.
In fact, I never thought I'd go there	Fil-fatt qatt ma ħsibt li mmur hemm
But it happened.	Imma ġara.
I didn’t know anyone there	Jien ma kont naf lil ħadd hemmhekk
That would be wrong.	Dan ikun ħażin.
I'm sitting at home	Jien bilqiegħda d-dar
I had to go sit outside.	Kelli mmur noqgħod barra.
Try another one.	Ipprova waħda oħra.
I wonder what's going on	Nistaqsi x’qed jiġi
I hope there is none of this.	Nispera li ma jkun hemm xejn minn dan.
It does, of course.	Dan jagħmel, ovvjament.
There was one problem.	Kien hemm problema waħda.
He knew how to help.	Kien jaf kif seta’ jgħin.
I am very sorry for that	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal dan
Where would he go? 	Fejn kien imur?
.	.
I was thinking	Kont qed naħseb
I wanted to do a few things before that	Ridt nagħmel ftit affarijiet qabel dan
I'm home wherever you are	Jien id-dar tkun fejn int
Not a little.	Mhux ftit.
I think it would be a great, great thing.	Naħseb li tkun ħaġa kbira, kbira.
I try almost everyone.	Nipprova kważi kulħadd.
We have to be there.	Irridu nkunu hemm.
I thought it might be you	Ħsibt li jista 'jkun int
She needed none.	Ma kellha bżonn l-ebda.
That would not be a problem.	Dik ma tkunx problema.
This is what happens.	Dan huwa dak li jiġri.
Nothing is as it seems.	Xejn mhu kif jidher.
It was really great.	Kienet tassew ħafna.
Whether you like it or not.	Li trid jew ma tridx.
I was glad he was back	Kont ferħan li kien lura
You have to go there too.	Għandek tmur hemm ukoll.
I understand why he did that	Nifhem għaliex għamel dan
I didn’t have any of these	Jien ma kelli l-ebda waħda minn dawn
I did it.	għamilt dan.
I can think.	Jien nista' naħseb.
We cannot do that.	Ma nistgħux nagħmlu dan.
But he didn’t do that.	Imma ma kienx jagħmel dan.
I never expect to hear that again.	Qatt ma nistenna li nerġa’ nisma’ tgħid hekk.
I just need time alone	Għandi bżonn biss ħin waħdi
We did something together.	Għamilna xi ħaġa flimkien.
you must come to me.	trid tiġi għandi.
I have to talk first	L-ewwel għandi nitkellem
We need to know how or why.	Irridu nkunu nafu kif jew għaliex.
As I said.	Kif għedt.
I needed more than that	Jien kelli bżonn aktar minn hekk
I wanted to make things better for you	Ridt nagħmel l-affarijiet aħjar għalik
A job he loved and was good at	Xogħol li kien iħobb u li kien tajjeb għalih
He was a great man.	Kien raġel kbir.
Very small way.	Mod żgħir ħafna.
That says a lot.	Dan jgħid ħafna.
Maybe he should.	Forsi għandu.
I am supposed to know better	I suppost naf aħjar
You know it’s not.	Taf li mhuwiex.
I think that was what was right for him.	Naħseb li kien dak li kien tajjeb għalih.
He had done so.	Hekk kien għamel.
I hope all was well	Jien nittama li kollox kien tajjeb
Maybe he had.	Forsi kellu.
A little bit.	Ftit ftit.
Too little, it seems	Ftit wisq, milli jidher
I was too young to understand all this	Kont żgħir wisq biex nifhem dan kollu
And she knows what she’s planning.	U hi taf x'qed tippjana.
Maybe they should.	Forsi għandhom.
Come on, we’ll be back before it’s too late.	Ejja, se mmorru lura qabel ma jkun tard wisq.
I was happy for that	Kont kuntent għal dan
I've never had one before	Qatt ma kelli waħda qabel
I definitely did both.	Żgur li għamilt it-tnejn.
Look at another.	Ħares lejn ieħor.
I can still hear him say that.	Għadni nisma’ jgħid dan.
But maybe they are.	Imma forsi huma.
I was good with that	I kien tajjeb ma 'dak
And it may be so again.	U jista 'jkun hekk mill-ġdid.
I had no idea it was so long	Ma kontx idea li kien daqshekk twil
Only now and no more, he said.	Sa issa biss u mhux aktar, qal.
No, better not.	Le, aħjar le.
I thought about this a lot.	Ħsibt dwar dan ħafna.
There is no.	M'hemm l-ebda.
That was not the case.	Dan ma kienx hekk.
It was over.	Kien fuq.
I need to do.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel.
It has to be that way.	Irid ikun hekk.
I will not say otherwise	Mhux se ngħid mod ieħor
I have to do it now	Ikolli nagħmel dan issa
Nor did he look at both of them.	Lanqas ħares lejn it-tnejn li huma.
But we know soon, very soon.	Imma nafu dalwaqt, malajr ħafna.
So we did exactly that.	Hekk għamilna eżatt.
It does no work alone.	Ma jagħmel l-ebda xogħol waħdu.
I already know what happened	Diġà naf x’ġara
He knew more.	Kien jaf aktar.
I don’t know why, but they do.	Ma nafx għaliex, imma jagħmlu.
I think he was right	Naħseb li kellu raġun
I couldn't be either	Ma stajtx inkun lanqas
We had everything we needed.	Kellna dak kollu li kellna bżonn.
Well, it wasn’t.	Ukoll, ma kienx.
I want to go home	Jien irrid nerġa’ lura d-dar
I thought everyone would be happy	Ħsibt li kulħadd ikun kuntent
I know how everyone has his	Naf kif kulħadd għandu tiegħu
I have no idea how to do things	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif jagħmlu l-affarijiet
I can't talk about it	Ma nistax nitkellem dwarha
I heard one not long ago	Smajt wieħed mhux twil ilu
I think he doesn’t speak	Naħseb li ma titkellem
These are just a few.	Dawn huma biss ftit.
I was never going for anything	Qatt ma kont se għal xejn
I truly believe that.	Jien tassew nemmen li.
She knows what will happen next.	Hija taf x'se jiġri wara.
Not such a good idea.	Mhux idea daqshekk tajba.
Maybe this would be good for us.	Forsi dan ikun tajjeb għalina.
I was only there last night	I kien hemm biss ilbieraħ filgħaxija
But not nearly enough.	Imma mhux kważi biżżejjed.
I just thought you should know the truth	Ħsibt biss li għandek tkun taf il-verità
Not if he can wait.	Mhux jekk jista’ jistenna.
I think it’s too late.	Naħseb li jiġi tard wisq.
There was so little time, and so much to say.	Kien hemm daqshekk ftit ħin, u tant xi ngħid.
Have a good time.	Għandhom ħin tajjeb.
He wanted to.	Ried.
No, there wasn’t anyone right now.	Le, ma kienx hemm xi ħadd bħalissa.
I also like to do a little.	Jien ukoll nixtieq nagħmel ftit.
I think it probably is.	Naħseb li probabbilment hu.
It was never time.	Qatt ma sar żmien.
Sorry, there is nothing we can do.	Jiddispjaċini, m'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu.
I just can’t afford that	Jien biss ma nistax nixtri dak
I have nowhere to go	M'għandi fejn immur
That was what it was.	Kien dak li kien.
I heard something	Smajt xi ħaġa
You don’t want to be seen anymore.	Ma tridx aktar tidher.
Better than nothing.	Aħjar minn xejn.
I know what you're thinking	Naf x'qed taħseb
He was not happy.	Ma kienx kuntent.
I did, but I couldn't prove it.	Għamilt, imma ma setax jipprova dan.
It does the job.	Jagħmel ix-xogħol.
I’m good at other things	Jien tajjeb għal affarijiet oħra
She never was.	Hija qatt ma kienet.
I can’t say this enough	Ma nistax ngħid dan biżżejjed
He doesn’t want to leave.	Ma jridx jitlaq.
I still don’t see both.	Għadni ma nara t-tnejn.
Only once.	Darba waħda biss.
I'm too sorry.	Jiddispjaċini wisq.
I had someone there with me.	Kelli xi ħadd hemmhekk miegħi.
I’ve been thinking about a little more for a long time	Jien stajt naħseb fi ftit ieħor għal żmien twil
But they are too late.	Imma huma tard wisq.
I can try another	Nista' nipprova ieħor
And they are right.	U għandhom raġun.
And you can see why.	U tista 'tara għaliex.
There was a lot of that as well.	Kien hemm ħafna minn dan ukoll.
Not for everyone.	Mhux għal kulħadd.
Did this really happen ?, he says.	Dan verament ġara?, jgħid.
I couldn’t tell you that.	Ma stajtx ngħidlek hekk.
I just want to be friends	Irrid inkun ħbieb biss
I’m actually having fun	Fil-fatt qed nieħu gost
I couldn’t believe it was happening to me	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien qed jiġri lili
I want everything.	Irrid kollox.
I'm afraid it will never be good again	Nibża li qatt mhu se jerġa’ jkun tajjeb
I went to my room to sit down	Mort fil-kamra tiegħi biex noqgħod bilqiegħda
Maybe that was what he had to do.	Forsi dan kien dak li kellu jagħmel.
But of course he thought so.	Imma ovvjament kien jaħseb hekk.
I’m glad if that was so.	Jien kuntent jekk dan kien hekk.
I need help, please.	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna, jekk jogħġbok.
I can't do anything like that	Ma nista nagħmel xejn bħal dan
I did exactly what I was told to do	Għamilt eżatt dak li qalli nagħmel
But so it happened.	Imma hekk ġara.
I didn’t believe it	Jien ma kontx nemmen
That's not us.	Dak mhux aħna.
But not everyone is so sure.	Imma mhux kulħadd huwa daqshekk ċert.
That really started something.	Li verament beda xi ħaġa.
He says he wants the job.	Jgħid li jrid ix-xogħol.
And so it looked.	U hekk kien ħares.
I wanted to go.	Ridt immur.
Now that he had.	Issa li kellu.
I still can't talk about it	Għadni ma nistax nitkellem dwarha
I can see everyone	Kapaċi nara lil kulħadd
I can say that he is not the same boy	Nista’ ngħid li mhux l-istess tifel
I'm not going to tell you anything.	Jien mhu ser ngħidlek xejn.
Just something I was trying to understand.	Biss xi ħaġa li kont qed nipprova nifhem.
For years and years.	Għal snin u snin.
If you're ready.	Jekk int lest.
She was a morning person.	Kienet persuna filgħodu.
I need to tell someone, just once.	Għandi bżonn ngħid lil xi ħadd, darba biss.
I wanted that too, but not now	Jien ridt hekk ukoll, imma mhux issa
She was only here for a few hours.	Kienet hawn biss ftit sigħat.
This happens more often than not.	Dan jiġri aktar spiss milli le.
But let me see.	Imma ħa nara.
It was the last time she did this.	Kienet l-aħħar darba li għamlet dan.
It was good.	Kien tajjeb.
I couldn't believe it	I ma stajtx nemmen
But you came together.	Imma int ġejt flimkien.
Same thing here.	L-istess ħaġa hawn.
I'm still not sure why	Għadni mhux ċert għaliex
I can't say.	Ma nistax ngħid.
He didn’t have to wait.	Ma kellux għalfejn jistenna.
There is nothing wrong with that.	M'hemm xejn ħażin dwarha.
I don’t want this anymore	Ma rridx dan aktar
But not only that.	Imma mhux hekk biss.
I couldn’t see better	Ma stajtx nara aħjar
We have a little more on the back for you.	Għandna xi ftit aktar fuq wara għalik.
But everyone knew what it was and who it was.	Imma kulħadd kien jaf x’inhu u min kien.
I still wasn't too sure	Għadni ma kontx ċert wisq
I had to do something before I got home	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa qabel ma ġie d-dar
He didn’t want to go home.	Ma riedx imur id-dar.
Maybe they should.	Forsi għandhom.
I thought it was just me.	Ħsibt li kont jien biss.
I think everyone was just tired.	Naħseb li kulħadd kien biss għajjien.
Good to be here.	Tajjeb li tkun hawn.
That's how much we will.	Li kemm aħna se.
I want to do this	Irrid nagħmel dan
This is too difficult to do.	Dan huwa wisq diffiċli biex isir.
He could not do that.	Ma setax jagħmel dan.
I wanted to know a lot of things	Ridt inkun naf ħafna affarijiet
I need to know what's going on with you	Għandi bżonn inkun naf x'inhu jiġri miegħek
So be it.	Hekk ikun.
I think that's enough	Naħseb li huwa biżżejjed
I need to go home	Għandi bżonn nerġa’ lura d-dar
I think it's a good one	Naħseb li hija waħda tajba
I have little to say	Għandi ma tantx nitkellem
I was a good man.	Jien kont raġel tajjeb.
I know.	inkun naf.
But he was tired tonight.	Imma kien għajjien illejla.
They were making out.	Huma kienu jagħmlu barra.
Good if you don't want to tell me why.	Tajjeb jekk ma tridx tgħidli għaliex.
And no money.	U bla flus.
It was good the first time.	Kien tajjeb l-ewwel darba.
I don't even know anymore.	Lanqas naf aktar.
You have to be there.	Trid tkun hemm.
He came alone.	Ġie waħdu.
Nothing happened.	Ma ġara xejn.
I just wanted to go home	Ridt biss immur id-dar
But that’s one thing.	Imma dik hija ħaġa waħda.
I hope all of you can do that	Nispera li inti kollha tista 'tagħmel dan
He had to do it.	Kellu jagħmel dan.
He would have to wait.	Kien ikollu jistenna.
We have to do the same.	Irridu nagħmlu l-istess.
I think that’s a great idea	Naħseb li hija idea kbira
I think it’s time for you to come home	Naħseb li wasal iż-żmien għalik li tiġi d-dar
I was good too.	Jien kont tajjeb ukoll.
But he didn’t just appear.	Imma hu ma deherx biss.
Nothing could have.	Xejn seta' jkollu.
I want to be able to see things	Irrid inkun qed nara l-affarijiet
He wants to go with you.	Irid imur miegħek.
This is not what happened.	Dan mhux dak li ġara.
When you think about it.	Meta taħseb dwarha.
I want you to be here with me	Nixtieq li tkun hawn miegħi
There was something.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa.
I shouldn’t have done that	Jien ma kellix għamilt hekk
That was great.	Dak kien kbir.
I think maybe it’s time you know	Naħseb li forsi wasal iż-żmien li taf
I doubt we can.	Niddubita li nistgħu.
I know what he's going to say all the time	Naf x’se jgħid il-ħin kollu
Not coming back.	Mhux ġej lura.
But it was really hard.	Imma kien tassew diffiċli.
That is forever.	Dak li hu għal dejjem.
To me.	Sa jien.
I can't wait !!.	Ma nistax nistenna!!.
I can't say what it is	Ma nistax ngħid x'inhu
I am much better today	Jiena ħafna aħjar illum
This is the house.	Din hija d-dar.
Everyone is coming.	Kulħadd ġej.
And looked at.	U ħares lejn.
It’s actually my job.	Huwa fil-fatt ix-xogħol tiegħi.
not sure how to do it.	mhux ċert kif tagħmel dan.
I really wasn't all there	Verament ma kontx kollu hemm
And how you want to talk.	U kif trid titkellem.
I couldn’t just go with him	Ma stajtx immur miegħu biss
And so it is.	U hekk hu.
A little more would be great	Ftit aktar ikun kbir
I'm afraid you're right	Nibża li għandek raġun
I am you, and you are me	Jien int, u int jien
I know how they felt	Naf kif ħassu
I'm having fun !.	Qed nieħu gost!.
That's how it should work.	Hekk għandu jaħdem.
I just didn’t want to be in my room	Jien biss ma ridtx fil-kamra tiegħi
I could never understand this	Qatt ma stajt nifhem dan
All this I did not know	Dan kollu ma kontx naf
Not too much yet.	Għadu mhux wisq.
I can do what you do	Jien nista' nagħmel dak li tagħmel int
I really eat after all	Jien verament niekol wara kollox
I think that was happening	Naħseb li kien jiġri
Or much more than anything else.	Jew ħafna minn kull ħaġa oħra.
I never was.	Jien qatt ma kont.
I’m having more fun.	Qed nieħu gost aktar.
No, it couldn't be.	Le, ma setax ikun.
That’s just me talking.	Dan qed nitkellem jien biss.
I really believe that	Jien verament nemmen li
And what, and what.	U dak, u dak.
She was going to say no.	Kienet se tgħid le.
Well, you're mine now.	Ukoll, int tiegħi issa.
I thought it shouldn’t work	Ħsibt li m'għandux jaħdem
I don’t know, really.	Ma nafx, tassew.
He is a man.	Huwa raġel.
This is one.	Dan huwa wieħed.
I couldn't hear what he was saying	Ma stajtx nisma’ dak li kien qed jgħid
She was with some friends.	Kienet ma’ xi ħbieb.
It had to be.	Kellu jkun.
I will do it again.	Jien nerġa' nagħmel dan.
Before that, there is nothing.	Qabel dan, m'hemm xejn.
I want to say more	Irrid li jgħid aktar
Well, nothing goes here.	Ukoll, hawn ma jmur xejn.
All the things you need.	L-affarijiet kollha li għandek bżonn.
A little small.	Ftit żgħir.
We will do it for you.	Aħna se nagħmlu dan għalik.
But he was not playing.	Imma ma kienx jilgħab.
I seem to have problems almost every now and then	Jidher li għandi problemi kważi kull darba issa
I can’t believe I was my teacher	Ma nistax nemmen li kont għalliem tiegħi
I'm not enough.	Jien mhux biżżejjed.
It happens to almost everyone	Jiġri lil kważi kulħadd
I can see where this was going.	Jien nista' nara fejn kien sejjer dan.
I understand this now	Nifhem dan issa
Now I could see	Issa stajt nara
That we can do.	Li nistgħu nagħmlu.
I know where it comes from	Naf minn fejn ġej
I didn’t tell anyone about what he did to me	Jien ma għedt lil ħadd dwar dak li għamel miegħi
It didn't take long.	Ma tantx ħa.
He couldn't say for sure.	Ma setax jgħid żgur.
I should have thought that	I kellha ħsibt dan
If so.	Jekk dan hu hekk.
That he needed help.	Li kellu bżonn l-għajnuna.
The further back you go, the better.	Aktar ma tmur lura, aħjar.
I didn’t know if this was right or wrong	Ma kontx naf jekk dan kienx tajjeb jew ħażin
I was quite happy with that	Kont pjuttost ferħan b'dan
This is probably not what you want.	Dan huwa probabbilment mhux dak li trid.
I was more than a little surprised	I kien aktar minn ftit sorpriż
I know he was going with me	Naf li kien imur miegħi
My friends are all there.	Ħbieb tiegħi kollha hemm.
Just to say I did.	Biss ngħid li għamilt.
I never have and never will	Qatt ma għandi u qatt ma se
This is both good and bad.	Dan huwa kemm tajjeb kif ukoll ħażin.
Everything was going so well.	Kollox kien sejjer daqshekk tajjeb.
I didn’t have time to think	Ma kellix ħin naħseb
I had no idea who might be there	Ma kellix idea min seta’ kien hemm
It's easy for you.	Huwa faċli għalik.
And there was more.	U kien hemm aktar.
Not so bad.	Mhux daqshekk ħażin.
In fact he could not play.	Fil-fatt ma setax jilgħab.
I've never been there before	Qatt ma kont hemm qabel
She needed to do so as well.	Hija kellha bżonn tagħmel hekk ukoll.
And a lot of time.	U ħafna ħin.
And it was.	U kien.
I could do that sooner	I tista 'tagħmel dan qabel
That is very likely.	Dak huwa probabbli ħafna.
I didn’t want to do that	Jien ma ridtx nagħmel hekk
He knew he was scared.	Kien jaf li kien jibża’.
There is a lot of time now.	Hemm ħafna ħin issa.
I know what that is.	Naf x'inhu dan.
I can’t tell when it just started.	Ma nistax ngħid meta beda eżatt.
I want them to do well.	Irrid li jagħmlu tajjeb.
Nothing is what is seen here.	Xejn huwa dak li jidher hawn.
And now it seems we can.	U issa jidher li nistgħu.
I wanted him to be in love with me	Ridt li jkun iħobb miegħi
You can tell, you know.	Tista’ tgħid, taf.
I hope he was the first	Jien nittama li kien l-ewwel
Nothing is certain.	Xejn mhu żgur.
There is no other way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor.
Still a bad idea.	Għadha idea ħażina.
Not many people do.	Mhux ħafna nies jagħmlu.
Maybe more than you want to know.	Forsi aktar milli trid tkun taf.
This seems to have been done very well.	Dan jidher li sar tajjeb ħafna.
For me, they were the same.	Għalija, kienu l-istess.
But no one really knows.	Imma ħadd ma jaf verament.
I shouldn't be talking about it	M'għandix inkun qed nitkellem dwarha
Well, it is and it is not.	Ukoll, huwa u mhuwiex.
You just didn’t do it.	Inti mhux biss għamilt dan.
He just couldn’t do it.	Biss ma setax għamel.
Just didn’t show up.	Biss ma deherx.
I knew it was probably	Kont naf li x’aktarx kienet
He should have help.	Għandu jkollu għajnuna.
Not everyone could take that	Mhux kulħadd seta’ jieħu dan
Little in fact.	Ftit fil-fatt.
I will not hear that	Jien mhux se nisma’ dan
I would be back.	Inkun lura.
I need some money.	Għandi bżonn xi flus.
I always see everything	Jien dejjem nara kollox
When she wasn’t, she knew that too.	Meta ma kinitx, dan kien jaf ukoll.
I thought it was a good thing	Ħsibt li kienet ħaġa tajba
No one was talking about any of this.	Ħadd ma kien qed jitkellem dwar xi ħaġa minn dan.
But it didn’t look like one.	Imma ma deherx bħal wieħed.
I was so worried	Kont tant inkwetat
It's great to see.	Huwa kbir biex tara.
I will do it alone	Jien se nagħmel dan waħdi
He was pretty sure what he had.	Kien pjuttost ċert li dak li kellu.
I didn’t want to be alone	Ma ridtx li jkun waħdu
He who he is.	Hu min hu.
I think you want to do that	Naħseb li trid tagħmel hekk
I will make mine.	Jien se nagħmel tiegħi.
I wasn’t ready for that	Jien ma kontx lest għal dan
I want to be here with you	Irrid inkun hawn miegħek
This happens a lot.	Dan jiġri ħafna.
It just takes forever.	Huwa biss jieħu għal dejjem.
I'm good too.	Jien tajjeb ukoll.
He said no.	Huwa qal le.
I couldn't speak	Ma stajtx nitkellem
I wonder if it was more for me than for him.	Nistaqsi jekk kienx aktar għalija milli għalih.
And it was wrong.	U kien ħażin.
He had no job, no job.	Ma kellux xogħol, ma għamel l-ebda xogħol.
I knew it wasn’t going to work	Kont naf li ma kienx se jaħdem
I think he was too scared to say no	Naħseb li kien jibża wisq biex jgħid le
It may never come.	Jista’ qatt ma jiġi.
To both.	Lil kemm.
I'll talk to you soon	Jien dalwaqt nitkellem miegħek
I think that’s a great thing	Naħseb li hija ħaġa kbira
We didn’t even know it was there.	Lanqas biss konna nafu li kien hemm.
I wanted to know too	Ridt inkun naf ukoll
That won’t work.	Dak mhux se jaħdem.
I have to do something.	Ikolli nagħmel xi ħaġa.
I haven’t thought about it in a long time.	Ilni ma naħseb dwar dan.
That’s ready by now.	Dak lest sa issa.
And maybe so.	U forsi hekk.
I just wait.	Nistenna biss.
And another and another and another.	U ieħor u ieħor u ieħor.
I’m sure on that one.	Jien ċert fuq dak wieħed.
It is something else.	Hija xi ħaġa oħra.
I have to tell you something	Għandi ngħidlek xi ħaġa
I have no friends	M'għandi l-ebda ħbieb
I thought he wasn’t going to, that he was ready with me.	Ħsibt li ma kienx se, li kien lest miegħi.
I really need to go home	Verament għandi bżonn immur id-dar
I can do things again	Nista' nerġa' nagħmel l-affarijiet
He doesn't have to talk about it.	M’għandux għalfejn jitkellem għalih.
I didn’t have to ask	Ma kellix għalfejn nistaqsi
I can't do anything good here.	Ma nista' nagħmel xejn tajjeb hawn.
I didn't see anyone	Jien ma rajt lil ħadd
A boy he would probably never see	Tifel li x’aktarx qatt ma kien se jara
I couldn’t wait to be alone	Ma stajtx nistenna li nkun waħdi
It’s hard to be a man.	Huwa diffiċli li tkun raġel.
It looked good.	Deher li kien tajjeb.
They are few.	Huma ftit.
I know you like it that way	Naf li tixtieq hekk
I need to know what to do	Għandi bżonn inkun naf x'se tagħmel
But there it was, and not long before.	Imma kien hemm, u mhux twil qabel.
I have mine.	Jien għandi tiegħi.
Me too.	Jien ukoll.
He was helping someone.	Kien jgħin lil xi ħadd.
I really have to	I verament ikolli
And tell the truth.	U għid il-verità.
I just love my job.	Inħobb ix-xogħol tiegħi biss.
I don’t know if it’s tonight.	Ma nafx jekk hux illejla.
I don’t have time to think.	M'għandix ħin biex naħseb.
Time is money.	Iż-żmien huwa flus.
I hope you are there	Nispera li tkun hemm
I can't wait to see what happens	Ma nistax noqgħod nara x’se jiġri
Not what it was.	Mhux dak li kien.
I already wanted to go home	Diġà ridt immur id-dar
I can’t tell you why.	Ma nistax ngħidlek għaliex.
I hear what you need	Nisma dak li għandek bżonn
It’s just how things are.	Huwa biss kif huma l-affarijiet.
I thought it was there.	Kont naħseb li kien hemm.
I may never be able to eat again.	Jista’ jkun li qatt ma nista’ nerġa’ niekol.
As he did.	Kif għamel hu.
Everything else looks good.	Kollox ieħor jidher tajjeb.
I was trying to figure out how to do it.	Kont qed nipprova nifhem kif nagħmel dan.
I wasn’t sure what to believe	Ma kontx ċert x'se nemmen
I was not afraid of anything	Ma kont nibża’ minn xejn
He had done this before.	Huwa kien għamel dan qabel.
I didn’t know anyone else was here	Ma kontx naf li kien hawn xi ħadd ieħor
I understand you are fine	Nifhem li int tajjeb
I just need some time.	Għandi bżonn biss ftit ħin.
It should be helpful.	Għandu jkun ta 'għajnuna.
And there was nothing wrong.	U ma kien hemm xejn ħażin.
It may be the last time.	Jista’ jkun l-aħħar darba.
Come for me.	Ejja għalija.
I don’t need to talk much.	M'għandix bżonn nitkellem ħafna.
I really need to know better	Verament għandi nkun naf aħjar
I wonder where she was	Nistaqsi fejn kienet
Few were.	Ftit kienu.
I can’t prove that either.	Ma nistax nipprova li lanqas.
I was right, she was really beautiful	Kelli raġun, kienet tassew sabiħa
I wasn’t ready for what came next	Ma kontx lest għal dak li ġie wara
It wasn’t so early for him.	Ma kienx daqshekk kmieni għalih.
I thought no one knew what it was	Ħsibt li ħadd ma jkun jaf x’kien
I really just wanted to talk to you	Verament ridt biss nitkellem miegħek
You actually know better.	Fil-fatt taf aħjar.
I hope we will be friends	Nittama li se nkunu ħbieb
Usually a few hours.	Normalment ftit sigħat.
I wonder why you did that	Nista’ naħseb għaliex għamilt dan
It's not who you know.	Mhuwiex min taf.
He just happens to live here.	Huwa biss jiġri li jgħix hawn.
I need to understand everything	Għandi bżonn nifhem kollox
She was, you know.	Kienet, taf.
And he needs your help right now.	U bħalissa għandu bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
I thought you just said that	Ħsibt li għadek kif għedt hekk
There I am just now.	Hemm jien biss issa.
I’m a little better than he is	Jien ftit aħjar milli hu
And so you have.	U hekk għandek.
So we did.	Hekk għamilna.
But he wants more.	Imma jrid aktar.
I know exactly where he is	Naf eżatt fejn hu
They should, of course.	Għandhom, ovvjament.
I have to go to school	Ikolli mmur l-iskola
Very good.	Tajjeb ħafna.
I also didn’t know when it would happen	Ma kontx naf ukoll meta se jiġri
I know what you're going to say	Naf x'se tgħid
And so good.	U hekk tajjeb.
And you can do it at home.	U tista 'tagħmel dan id-dar.
I can always come back	Jien dejjem nista' nerġa' lura
I have no idea where he is.	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn hu.
I was once, of course	Jien kont darba, ovvjament
I couldn't believe what he was saying	Ma stajtx nemmen dak li kien qed jgħid
You know, probably not.	Taf, probabbilment le.
I have a big problem with this	Għandi problema kbira b'dan
That was a long time ago.	Dak kien ilu żmien.
Not there yet.	Għadu mhux hemm.
He is someone who.	Huwa xi ħadd li.
I couldn’t believe he said that	Ma stajtx nemmen li qal hekk
I couldn't be outside	Ma stajtx ilni barra
I hope this works.	Nittama li dan jaħdem.
I’m not sure, but maybe.	M'inix ċert, imma forsi.
But no, he was ready.	Imma le, kien lest.
I knew it too.	Jien kont naf ukoll.
She was often there alone.	Ħafna drabi kienet hemm waħedha.
For me, that was too much.	Għalija, dan kien wisq.
He never asked for it.	Huwa qatt ma talab għal dan.
No, he actually did things.	Le, fil-fatt għamel l-affarijiet.
That's not good.	Dak mhux tajjeb.
It is supposed to be.	Suppost li jkun.
First, he would take a seat.	L-ewwel, kien jieħu bilqiegħda.
Or if you don’t.	Jew jekk ma tagħmilx hekk.
This can take as long as a year.	Dan jista 'jieħu daqs sena.
Whatever.	Tkun xi tkun.
Not here like where she was.	Mhux hawn bħal fejn kienet.
No, not so much.	Le, mhux hekk.
And that one.	U dak wieħed.
A child who is capable	Tifel li kapaċi
I couldn't wait	Ma stajtx nistenna
I had no idea.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea ta 'dan.
He did something.	Għamel xi ħaġa.
I didn’t know how to tell you	Ma kontx naf kif ngħidlek
I said the same thing	għidt l-istess ħaġa
I always have trouble doing that	Dejjem għandi problemi biex nagħmel hekk
But that was before.	Imma dak kien qabel.
It looked like one, too.	Deher qisu wieħed, ukoll.
It is working well.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb.
He had no idea he was going to leave like that.	Ma kellux idea li se jitlaq hekk.
I’m very, very happy	Jien kuntent ħafna, ħafna
That was it.	Kien dak.
I thought something had happened.	Ħsibt li ġara xi ħaġa.
It really is.	Huwa tassew.
For someone to come back.	Biex xi ħadd jiġi lura.
This is very wrong.	Dan huwa ħażin ħafna.
Just to say let's.	Biss ngħid li ejja.
And where he can, he's not with him.	U fejn jista’, ma jkunx miegħu.
Hard time to do that.	Żmien diffiċli biex tagħmel dan.
Maybe good, maybe bad.	Forsi tajjeb, forsi ħażin.
Like a child.	Bħal tifel.
Sometimes I wish it was me, no	Xi drabi nixtieq li kont jien, mhux
I wish it wasn’t so	Nixtieq li ma kienx hekk
Sometimes it happens.	Xi drabi jiġri.
That was probably the last time.	Probabbilment dik kienet probabbilment l-aħħar darba.
And so it is.	U hekk hu.
It’s much better than that.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna minn dak.
I was thinking about it	Kont qed naħseb dwarha
For hours we were.	Għal sigħat konna.
I thought it would be more than that	Ħsibt li jkun aktar minn hekk
Can anyone please help ??.	Jista' xi ħadd jekk jogħġbok jgħin??.
Everything looks great.	Kollox jidher kbir.
And you know.	U taf.
But there may be.	Imma jista’ jkun hemm.
It looked good.	Deher tajjeb.
Not ready yet.	Għadu mhux lest.
You have to do it.	Inti għandek tagħmel dan.
But it was so big.	Imma kien tant kbir.
And that wasn’t me.	U dak ma kontx jien.
Wherever you normally are.	Fejn normalment tkun.
It was the last one too.	Kien l-aħħar ukoll.
I can’t wait much longer	Ma nistax nistenna ħafna aktar
I have no idea how this is.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif dan.
I want to see what happens	Irrid immur nara x’qed jiġri
And he wanted to be there when it happened.	U ried ikun hemm meta ġara.
I want it to be fast	Irrid li jkun malajr
More about it here.	Aktar dwarha hawn.
We did some work there.	Għamilna xi xogħol hemmhekk.
Not enough yet.	Għadu mhux biżżejjed.
I think he knows by now	Naħseb li sa issa jaf
That was too much.	Dan kien wisq.
I want to be sure.	Nixtieq inkun ċert.
I knew it would happen someday	Kont naf li se jiġri xi darba
I didn’t know where he lived	Ma kontx naf fejn jgħix
Now we are one.	Issa aħna wieħed.
He never told me how he really felt.	Qatt ma qalli kif tassew ħassu.
You will do very well.	Int ser tagħmel tajjeb ħafna.
It was a lot of things for him.	Kienet ħafna affarijiet għalih.
I understand why this could be.	Nifhem għaliex dan jista’ jkun.
I wasn’t sure about that	Jien ma kontx ċert dwar dan
No, not so much.	Le, mhux hekk.
Everything so fast.	Kollox hekk malajr.
Same as yours.	L-istess bħal tiegħek.
I really wanted to think about it	Verament ridt naħseb dwarha
I still couldn't believe it	Għadni ma kontx nemmen
I wasn’t too worried	Ma kontx inkwetat wisq
He didn’t like talking about it.	Ma kienx iħobb jitkellem dwarha.
I’m not here right now.	Jien mhux hawn bħalissa.
I know you too.	Naf li int ukoll.
This seems to have been done	Dan jidher li sar
The things I said.	L-affarijiet li għidt.
It makes the job better.	Jagħmel ix-xogħol aħjar.
I'll be back if you need anything	Jien inkun fuq wara jekk għandek bżonn xi ħaġa
I couldn’t see any.	Ma stajt nara l-ebda.
He first had to take help.	L-ewwel kellu jieħu l-għajnuna.
Tell anyone where you are.	Tgħid lil ħadd fejn int.
I know it was wrong now.	Naf li kien ħażin issa.
But it's pretty good !.	Imma huwa pjuttost tajjeb!.
It was hard to be friends with him	Kien diffiċli li tkun ħbieb miegħu
I’m not sure what’s wrong.	M'inix ċert x'inhu ħażin.
That's us.	Dak aħna.
I want to know what it is	Irrid inkun naf x'inhu
He always knows.	Huwa dejjem jaf.
This is where it gets harder.	Dan huwa fejn isir aktar diffiċli.
A car is not a person	Karozza mhix persuna
I can’t wait to be his friend	Ma nistax nistenna li nkun ħabib tiegħu
He’s too good at it.	Huwa wisq tajjeb dwar dan.
You plan what you eat.	Inti tippjana dak li tiekol.
He had seen this before.	Huwa kien ra dan qabel.
I hope you can as well	Qed nittama li inti tista 'kif hekk
Unless we will.	Sakemm aħna mhux se.
I thought it might be hard for you.	Ħsibt li jista 'jkun diffiċli għalik.
She had a young child, about a year old.	Kellha tifel żgħir, ta’ madwar sena.
Some things do.	Xi affarijiet jagħmlu.
That was good for that.	Dan kien tajjeb għal dak.
She knew who she was.	Kienet taf min kienet.
Nor should I tell you this	Lanqas għandi ngħidlek dan
I was going to be fine	Kont se nkun tajjeb
And there is nothing you can do about it.	U m'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
But here they are again.	Imma hawn huma mill-ġdid.
I know exactly where she is	Naf eżatt fejn hi
That was it.	Dak kien.
You will say.	Inti se tgħid.
He didn't want to.	Ma riedx.
It was what he needed.	Kienet dak li kellu bżonn.
I'm coming soon	Jien ġej dalwaqt
My will not be so.	Tiegħi mhux se jkun hekk.
I didn’t know it was so	Ma kontx naf li kien hekk
I wonder what he was doing there	Nistaqsi x’kien qed jagħmel hemmhekk
I think please you	Naħseb li jekk jogħġbok inti
I thought maybe we could be friends	Ħsibt li forsi nistgħu nkunu ħbieb
It's just really good.	Huwa biss tassew tajjeb.
I want to be a better man	Irrid inkun raġel aħjar
I want to be sure.	Nixtieq inkun ċert.
I never had time for one.	Qatt kelli ħin għal waħda waħda.
It will look like nothing ever happened.	Se jkun qisu qatt ma ġara xejn.
No one seemed to know where he was.	Ħadd ma deher li kien jaf fejn kien.
I want to talk about this	Irrid nitkellem dan
Sure.	Żgur.
Not enough money.	Mhux biżżejjed flus.
It really is something.	Hija verament xi ħaġa.
I was talking to him	Kont nitkellem miegħu
To do something.	Biex tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I was counting on that too	Jien kont noqgħod fuq dan ukoll
We are.	Aħna.
And that’s not alone.	U li mhux waħdu.
I was wrong.	Jien kont ħażin.
I don’t know how I did but I did.	Ma nafx kif għamilt imma għamilt.
I know everything will be fine	Naf li kollox se jkun tajjeb
It does too.	Jagħmel ukoll.
Maybe you do.	Forsi inti tagħmel.
Not a good idea.	Mhix idea tajba.
I couldn’t stand a chance of that happening	Ma stajtx nieħu ċans li jiġri hekk
I love this.	Jien inħobb din.
I’m the only one who knows.	Jien l-uniku wieħed li jaf.
It doesn’t have to.	M'għandux għalfejn.
These are problems.	Dawn huma problemi.
We will be here a little.	Se nkunu hawn ftit.
I know this is wrong.	Naf li dan huwa ħażin.
And a year.	U sena.
It wasn’t there.	Ma kienx hemm.
He looks like a man leaving.	Jidher bħal raġel li qed jitlaq.
I still couldn’t tell	Għadni ma stajtx ngħid
I wish it was me	Nixtieq li kien jien
You knew you were doing something.	Kont taf li kont qed tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I also have one.	Jien ukoll għandi wieħed.
I was able to eat afterwards	Jien stajt niekol wara
I wanted to try to do something else.	Ridt nipprova nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
I've been really good for a while	Verament ilni tajjeb għal xi żmien
I had never seen it like this before.	Qatt ma kont rajt hekk qabel.
I probably already said too much	Probabbilment kont diġà għedt wisq
It was like trying to do something else.	Kien qisu qed jipprova jagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
I made no friends	Ma għamilt l-ebda ħbieb
I knew nothing	Jien ma kont naf xejn
Not who did it.	Mhux min għamel.
I didn’t know enough.	Ma kontx naf biżżejjed.
I wanted to go back to school	Ridt immur lura l-iskola
Maybe it will never be the time.	Forsi qatt ma jkun il-ħin.
I’m going to tell the truth to everyone, now.	Jien se ngħid il-verità lil kulħadd, issa.
There must be something wrong with me.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa ħażina miegħi.
And on and on this goes.	U fuq u fuq din tmur.
I probably never will	Probabbilment qatt mhu se nkun
Everyone could see this.	Kulħadd seta' jara dan.
Go to me.	Imur għandi.
I knew why, of course	Kont naf għaliex, ovvjament
In fact, more and more.	Fil-fatt, aktar u aktar.
I'm home.	Jien id-dar.
Here's what's happening.	Hawn x'qed jiġri.
I wasn’t sure before.	Ma kontx ċert qabel.
I had never loved before	Qatt ma kont inħobb qabel
I don’t want to do that.	Ma rridx nagħmel hekk.
I really need to talk to you	Għandi verament bżonn nitkellem miegħek
No one was coming.	Ħadd ma kien ġej.
Everyone was doing, he thought.	Kulħadd kien jagħmel, ħaseb.
I was tired.	Kont għajjien.
I can think, but it shouldn’t.	Nista' naħseb, imma m'għandux.
It can take a long time.	Jista 'jieħu żmien twil.
Much better now.	Ħafna aħjar issa.
In doing so.	Meta tagħmel dan.
I needed some time to think	Kelli bżonn ftit ħin biex naħseb
I don’t want to go.	Ma rridx immur.
I once did.	Darba għamilt jien.
It was a great one.	Kienet waħda kbira.
I just wanted to see how I was	Ridt biss nara kif kont
This has now been done.	Dan issa sar.
I can’t wait to go to school	Ma nistax nistenna li mmur l-iskola
I did now.	Għamilt issa.
I never thought so	Qatt ma kont naħseb
I couldn't understand how or why	Ma stajtx nifhem kif jew għaliex
What one needs.	Dak li wieħed għandu bżonn.
I can tell he's thinking	Nista 'ngħid li qed jaħseb
And this is happening right now.	U dan qed jiġri bħalissa.
Great man, good man	Raġel kbir, raġel tajjeb
It was busy.	Kien okkupat.
I don't want to talk to you.	Ma rridx nitkellem miegħek.
That was it, now.	Dan kien hawn, issa.
But you are not.	Imma m'intix.
He doesn't need that now.	Huwa m'għandux bżonn dan issa.
It's not a problem.	Hu mhux problema.
I have seen that before.	Rajt li qabel.
That was too bad.	Dak kien ħażin wisq.
He was making sure of that.	Huwa kien jagħmel ċert minn dan.
It would be better around.	Ikun aħjar madwar.
I didn't stand a chance	Ma kellix ċans
How can.	Kif jista.
He seemed to take it.	Deher li ħa.
Nothing great about it either	Xejn kbir dwarha lanqas
This should be easy.	Dan għandu jkun faċli.
Who knows.	Min jaf.
It was all.	Kien kollu.
A better one.	Waħda aħjar.
Nothing like this here.	Xejn bħal dan hawn.
I go alone, which is good	Immur waħdi, li huwa tajjeb
Everything else you want to know.	Kull ħaġa oħra li trid tkun taf.
I still think you are right	Għadni naħseb li għandek raġun
He can't play anymore.	Ma jistax jilgħab aktar.
If it were that easy, everyone would do it.	Kieku kien daqshekk faċli kulħadd seta’ jagħmel dan.
He didn't know how.	Ma kienx jaf kif.
I could go home	Stajt immur id-dar
I never was or will be	Jien qatt ma kont jew se nkun
I have it ready for you	Għandi lest għalik
You will see.	Inti se tara.
Now, it was over.	Issa, kien aktar.
I know he is telling the truth	Naf li qed jgħid il-verità
You know you can't.	Taf li ma tistax.
I've never been like that.	Jien qatt ma kont hekk.
Nobody said anything.	Ħadd ma qal xejn.
I’ve never been around a boy before	Qatt ma kont madwar tifel qabel
I know I can't be me	Naf li ma nistax inkun jien
I hope you will	Nispera li tiġi
I did a lot of work	Jien għamilt ħafna xogħol
When he came out.	Meta ħareġ.
And nothing was ready.	U xejn ma kien lest.
I shouldn't say that	M'għandix ngħid hekk
It has been happening.	Ġie jiġri.
I knew what it looked like	Kont naf kif kien jidher
I have never been here before.	Qatt ma kont hawn qabel.
But I know what happened	Imma naf x'ġara
I can't say.	Jien ma nistax ngħid.
But not for everyone.	Imma mhux għal kulħadd.
No one is around.	Ħadd mhu madwar.
I’m not sure how much fun it is	M'inix ċert kemm hu gost
I can't be sure either	Lanqas nista’ nkun ċert
I couldn’t wait to tell other people about it	Ma stajtx nistenna li ngħid lil nies oħra dwarha
I wasn’t actually thinking about any of that.	Fil-fatt ma kont qed taħseb xejn minn hekk.
Maybe something else, too.	Forsi xi ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
I can't hear what he's saying.	Ma nistax nisma' x'qed jgħid.
Try it.	Ipprova hekk.
Not too much work either.	Mhux wisq xogħol lanqas.
Help other people wherever they can.	Jgħin nies oħra kull fejn jista’.
More was yet to come.	Aktar kien għadu ġej.
I know it looks good to you, and it can be.	Naf li jidher tajjeb għalik, u jista 'jkun.
I'm sorry, but it is.	Jiddispjaċini, imma huwa.
He had no problems.	Ma kellux problemi.
I was surprised by this	Kont sorpriż b’dan
She's his.	Hi tiegħu.
Maybe it shouldn’t have been that way.	Forsi ma kellux ikun hekk.
Someone is waiting.	Xi ħadd qed jistenna.
You can do whatever you want to do.	Tista 'tagħmel dak kollu li trid tagħmel.
I can tell you too	Nista’ ngħidlek ukoll
That never came out.	Li qatt ma ħareġ.
Surely I had never thought of it before	Żgur qatt ma kont ħsibt dwarha hekk qabel
He has done this before.	Huwa għamel dan qabel.
There is a little bit of everything.	Hemm ftit minn kollox.
I wasn’t expecting to stay out	Ma kontx qed nistenna li noqgħod barra
I have a hard time doing anything	Għandi diffiċli biex nagħmel xi ħaġa
This will obviously not work.	Dan ovvjament mhux se jaħdem.
I thought it would never happen	Ħsibt li qatt ma jista’ jiġri
Well, we were.	Ukoll, konna.
It was more about going for something	Kien aktar li tmur lejn xi ħaġa
Only time will tell how good it is.	Il-ħin biss jgħid kemm hu 'tajjeb'.
I wanted to be first	Ridt inkun l-ewwel
I’m glad you’re here, now	Jien kuntent li qiegħed hawn, issa
Just try.	Ipprova biss.
You know you can do the job.	Taf li tista’ tagħmel ix-xogħol.
It's out here.	Huwa hawn barra.
You are not worried.	M'intix inkwetat.
I am doing so now.	Qed nagħmel hekk issa.
From the outside.	Minn barra.
I know how great it is	Naf kemm jista’ jkun kbir
I was doing something for him	Jien kont nagħmel xi ħaġa għalih
Everyone was surprised.	Kulħadd kien sorpriż.
It will be good.	Hija se tkun tajba.
I was hoping you might know something about it	Kont nittama li forsi taf xi ħaġa dwarha
Too late in fact.	Tard wisq fil-fatt.
I think he still does	Jiena naħseb li għadu jagħmel
You go home.	Inti tmur id-dar.
My friend is like that	Ħabib tiegħi huwa hekk
You should know that by now.	Għandek tkun taf li sa issa.
Not that he was ever my friend.	Mhux li qatt kien ħabib tiegħi.
I have money and things	Għandi flus u affarijiet
More than once.	Aktar drabi minn darba.
But I couldn’t.	Imma ma stajtx.
I can’t tell you more than that	Ma nistax ngħidlek aktar minn dan
This was not good enough.	Dan ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed.
Maybe he didn't know what he was doing.	Forsi ma kienx jaf x’kien qed jagħmel.
But it works.	Imma jaħdem.
No one should have to live like that.	Ħadd ma għandu jkollu jgħix hekk.
I think there’s a little bit of that.	Naħseb li hemm ftit minn hekk.
But there’s a lot he can’t do.	Imma hemm ħafna li ma jistax jagħmel.
So far.	Sa issa.
He was not.	Hu ma kienx.
He is ready.	Huwa lest.
Few people are.	Ftit nies huma.
It's a big one.	Hija waħda kbira.
I didn't know it was you	Ma kontx naf li kont int
I think she is beautiful	Naħseb li hija sabiħa
Well, pretty good, actually.	Ukoll, pjuttost tajjeb, fil-fatt.
I wasn’t expecting that	Jien ma kontx qed nistenna hekk
I think they are probably right.	Naħseb li probabbilment għandhom raġun.
Everyone knows this.	Kulħadd jaf dan.
I'm worried and scared	Jien inkwetat u nibża’
He did really well.	Huwa għamel tassew tajjeb.
In fact, no.	Fil-fatt, le.
I doubt we ever did	Niddubita li fil-fatt qatt għamilna
I understand you are not saying anything	Nifhem li ma tgħid xejn
There is no other way around this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor madwar dan.
I know we don't know each other very well	Naf li ma tantx nafu lil xulxin
He hardly knows where she is.	Ma tantx jaf fejn hi.
You’re doing, you’re doing well.	Int qed tagħmel, int tagħmel tajjeb.
Meta.	Meta.
Something wrong with that one.	Xi ħaġa ħażina ma 'dak wieħed.
I needed to think fast	Kelli bżonn naħseb u malajr
And that’s really what it was.	U dan huwa verament dak li kien.
To be better.	Biex tkun aħjar.
I have this.	Għandi dan.
After a while you will know.	Wara ftit tkun taf.
He knew what was coming.	Kien jaf x’kien ġej.
I would be alone	Inkun waħdi
I was trying to understand why.	Kont qed nipprova nifhem għaliex.
Who would be surprised.	Min ikun sorpriż.
He was thinking.	Kien jaħseb.
You know, how do you do that? 	Taf, kif tagħmel dan?
I’ve seen it happen before	Rajt jiġri qabel
I have to talk to him first	Ikolli nitkellem miegħu l-ewwel
I’m really scared for you.	Jien tassew nibża għalik.
And it can be good.	U jista 'jkun tajjeb.
I hope to be around more often	Nittama li nkun madwar aktar spiss
I think you are right	Naħseb li għandek raġun
Not a person.	Mhux persuna.
Good to go.	Tajjeb li tmur.
That was what he wanted to say.	Kien dak li ried jgħid.
I’m always better when she’s with me	Jien dejjem aħjar meta hi miegħi
I want you to come with us.	Irrid li tiġi magħna.
This happened to me	Dan ġara lili
Everyone had fun.	Kulħadd ħa gost.
I didn’t want to do anything wrong	Ma ridtx nagħmel xejn ħażin
I think she knew that	Naħseb li kienet taf li
It looks really good.	Jidher tassew tajjeb.
Someone may not be able to play.	Xi ħadd jista 'ma jkun kapaċi li jkollu.
I can’t wait to be home	Ma nistax nistenna li nkun id-dar
He is the only one who can do that today.	Hu l-uniku wieħed li jista’ jagħmel dan illum.
Don’t take the same thing.	M'għandekx tieħu l-istess ħaġa.
I had never done this before	Qatt ma kont għamilt dan qabel
I want more than that	Irrid aktar minn hekk
I don't know why.	Ma nafx għaliex.
I had no idea	Ma kelli l-ebda idea ta 'dan
He will stay there again.	Se jerġa' joqgħod hemm.
He had never tried.	Hu qatt ma kien ipprova.
But you know.	Imma taf.
There is no just being done.	M'hemm l-ebda qed isir biss.
Everything works fine.	Kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
It took a long time.	Kienet tieħu ħafna ħin.
I can't buy anyone	Ma nistax nixtri lil xi ħadd
He has been here before.	Huwa kien hawn qabel.
This is more a thing to me.	Din hija aktar ħaġa lili.
He agreed to come back.	Huwa qabel li jiġi lura.
I'm an idea man.	Jien raġel idea.
No one was able to do that.	Ħadd ma kien kapaċi jagħmel dan.
It works for you which is great.	Jaħdem għalik li huwa kbir.
I hope they are right	Nispera li għandhom raġun
I can’t tell you really.	Ma nistax ngħidlek tassew.
I doubt it will be that long	Niddubita li se jkun daqshekk twil
It all happened.	Dak kollu ġara.
You can't do that now.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan issa.
But there was just that.	Imma kien hemm biss dik.
He could not do that.	Ma setax jagħmel dan.
He said he was glad to help.	Qal li kien ferħan li jgħin.
If you don’t, you don’t.	Jekk ma tagħmilx hekk, ma tagħmilx hekk.
That was just another.	Dan kien biss ieħor.
I was happy, and she wasn't	Kont kuntent, u hi ma kinitx
We know each other too well for this.	Nafu lil xulxin wisq tajjeb għal dan.
There was a time when.	Kien hemm żmien meta.
I need help to say enough is enough	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna biex ngħid biżżejjed huwa biżżejjed
It would be easy.	Ikun faċli.
You can only do it now.	Tista 'biss tagħmel inti issa.
I just hope it’s not for me.	Nispera biss li mhux għalija.
I don't have time for that	M'għandix ħin għal dan
So are mine.	Hekk huma tiegħi.
I hope they do.	Nispera li jagħmlu.
I just need your help	Għandi bżonn biss l-għajnuna tiegħek
I wanted to do this for you	Jien ridt nagħmel dan għalik
I just wish there wasn't so much need	Nixtieq biss li ma jkunx hemm tant bżonn
I'm interested in talking to you	Jien interessat li nitkellem miegħek
There was nothing else we could do.	Ma kien hemm xejn ieħor li nistgħu nagħmlu.
So it goes with it.	Hekk imur miegħu.
I doubt he needs much help	Niddubita li għandu bżonn ħafna għajnuna
He knows it was hard for you.	Jaf li kien diffiċli għalik.
I want to know	Jien irrid inkun naf
I thought the same thing a while ago	Ħsibt l-istess ħaġa ftit ilu
I’ve really never heard anything like this before	Tassew qatt ma kont smajt xi ħaġa bħal din qabel
She was right.	Hija kellha raġun.
She was very nice to him.	Kienet sabiħa ħafna miegħu.
I thought he was gone a long time ago	Ħsibt li kien mar ilu
It probably will.	Huwa probabbilment se jidher.
It was a lot of money.	Kienu ħafna flus.
If not too bad.	Jekk ma jkunx ħażin wisq.
I was too busy taking all this	Kont okkupat wisq nieħu dan kollu
Let’s go together.	Ejja mmorru flimkien.
She does what she is here.	Hija tagħmel dak li hi hawn.
I was here and saw everything	Jien kont hawn u rajt kollox
Almost a year.	Kważi sena.
Everyone wants more.	Kulħadd irid aktar.
But he had done nothing.	Imma ma kien għamel xejn.
I would like to have fun too	Nixtieq nieħu gost ukoll
I know, because you're saying	Naf, għaliex qed tgħid
I was accountable for everything else	Kont għal kull ħaġa oħra
Nobody wanted to.	Ħadd ma ried.
I will always be yours	Jien dejjem inkun tiegħek
I can't see this again	Ma nistax nara dan mill-ġdid
But he still has no friends.	Imma għadu m’għandux ħbieb.
Hopefully.	Wieħed jista’ jittama.
Maybe a little.	Forsi ftit.
It won’t, you know.	Mhux se tagħmel, taf.
This is not what we do.	Dan mhux dak li nagħmlu.
I thought it was good, you see	Ħsibt li kienet tajba, tara
I will do the same	Jien se nagħmel l-istess ħaġa
Really, that’s it.	Tassew, dak hu.
There is nothing like this here.	M'hemm xejn bħal dan hawn.
A year later, a year out.	Sena wara, sena barra.
I couldn't be alone	Ma stajtx inkun waħdi
I will make him a friend.	Se nagħmel ħabib tiegħu.
I didn’t expect her to be here	Ma kontx nistenna li tkun hawn
I am sure of that.	Jiena ċert minn dan.
It wasn’t going to be.	Ma kienx se jkun.
He had tried it all.	Huwa kien ipprova dan kollu.
Everything else is as it should be.	Kollox ieħor huwa kif għandu jkun.
He never knew.	Hu qatt ma kien ikun jaf.
And we did.	U għamilna.
I'll tell you everything	Jien ser ngħidlek kollox
A year earlier she had done the same thing	Sena qabel kienet għamlet l-istess ħaġa
I think it’s a really, really bad thing	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tassew, tassew ħażina
It's too much.	Huwa wisq.
As I saw yesterday.	Kif rajt ilbieraħ.
What is it.	X'inhi.
I need to know where you are all the time	Għandi bżonn inkun naf fejn int il-ħin kollu
I still have no idea where he went	Għadni m'għandix idea fejn mar
As it happens, this is not much.	Kif jiġri, dan mhux ħafna.
I spent a lot of time thinking about a few things.	Għamilt ħafna ħin naħseb dwar ftit affarijiet.
Here's what he said.	Hawn dak li qal.
You will actually be helpful.	Int fil-fatt tkun ta’ għajnuna.
You need someone who can speak for you.	Għandek bżonn xi ħadd li jista’ jitkellem għalik.
I only know his work	Naf ix-xogħol tiegħu biss
He was the first to do so.	Huwa kien l-ewwel li għamel dan.
That would be something about her talking about work, she knew.	Dik kienet tkun xi ħaġa dwarha titkellem fuq ix-xogħol, kienet taf.
It was good.	Kienet tajba.
I was quite a boy.	Kont pjuttost tifel.
Does this work ?.	Dan jaħdem?.
But there is a better way.	Imma hemm mod aħjar.
This looks better.	Dan jidher aħjar.
It was who came together.	Ġie min ġie flimkien.
Not yet for me.	Għadu mhux għalija.
I just said it again	Għidt darba oħra biss
Just to know.	Biss biex tkun taf.
It just arrived.	Wasal biss.
This must happen.	Dan għandu jiġri.
I was there all the time	Kont hemm il-ħin kollu
We like it.	Aħna bħal dan.
She had never thought about it.	Hija qatt ma kienet ħsibt dwarha.
And this is what we do.	U dan huwa dak li nagħmlu.
I wanted to say all these things but I couldn’t	Ridt ngħid dawn l-affarijiet kollha imma ma stajtx
I still wonder why it wasn’t	Għadni nistaqsi għaliex ma kienx
I'm supposed to talk to more.	Suppost nitkellem ma' aktar.
I have no problem saying just that	M'għandi l-ebda problema li ngħid biss
I don’t think you should be so worried	Naħseb li m'għandekx tkun daqshekk inkwetat
But that wasn’t so bad.	Imma dan ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
He is a very bad man.	Huwa raġel ħażin ħafna.
Obviously, this is a problem.	Ovvjament, din hija problema.
I wanted to be alone	Ridt inkun waħdi
I can't go to school	Ma nistax immur l-iskola
I want something.	Irrid xi ħaġa.
And look at that.	U ħares lejn dan.
I said so.	Jien għidt hekk.
Maybe nothing.	Forsi xejn.
From year to year.	Minn sena għal sena.
I don’t know who was more scared, me or him.	Ma nafx min kien aktar jibża, jien jew hu.
This is never easy.	Dan qatt mhu faċli.
If you had fun.	Jekk ħa gost.
I think everyone took a long time	Naħseb li kulħadd ħa ħafna ħin
It was pretty bad.	Kien pjuttost ħażin.
I didn’t have to say anything	Ma kellix għalfejn ngħid xi ħaġa
I stay in my room and do nothing for hours	Jien noqgħod fil-kamra tiegħi u ma nagħmel xejn għal sigħat
Boy, really.	Tifel, tassew.
I’m not going to go over one	Jien mhux se mmur fuq waħda
I will not ask why.	Mhux se nistaqsi għaliex.
He was as surprised as anyone.	Huwa kien sorpriż daqs kulħadd.
It was someone else.	Kien xi ħadd ieħor.
He goes back to doing nothing	Imur lura biex ma nagħmel xejn
I don’t know if it is or not.	Ma nafx jekk hux jew le.
We have many friends.	Għandna ħafna ħbieb.
I could think of it, that he wasn’t doing it	Stajt naħseb dwarha, li ma kienx qed jagħmel dan
And here we are.	U hawn aħna.
Size alone.	Daqs waħdu.
She had it.	Hija kellha dan.
I'm sure of it.	Jien ċert minn dan.
You don't seem to.	Inti ma jidhirx li.
There are already too many.	Diġà hemm wisq.
I want to know everything, now	Irrid inkun naf kollox, issa
You know it would.	Taf li kieku.
And that's a good thing.	U din hija ħaġa tajba.
Look out.	Ħares barra.
I'm tired.	Jiena għajjien.
Nobody knew what to expect.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x’se jistenna.
I can't believe it	Jien ma nistax nemmen
I will do well again	Se nerġa' nagħmel tajjeb
And that was hard enough.	U dan kien diffiċli biżżejjed.
Some things are the same.	Xi affarijiet huma l-istess.
I was out late last night	Ilbieraħ filgħaxija kont barra tard
I had thought about this before	I kellha ħsibt dwar dan qabel
I will not be very helpful	Mhux se nkun ħafna għajnuna
But not only that.	Imma mhux dan biss.
He would never do that.	Hu qatt ma kien jagħmel dan.
I have only done this a few times.	Dan għamilt biss ftit drabi.
It needs to be.	Jeħtieġ li jkun.
Sure, he said.	Żgur, qal.
This looks great.	Dan jidher kbir.
He's just a boy.	Huwa biss tifel.
That’s how we should be.	Hekk għandna nkunu.
That’s just money.	Dak hu biss flus.
That's so much.	Dak hu tant.
If only it could be that way again.	Kieku jista’ jerġa’ jkun hekk.
A very long time ago	Żmien tassew twil ilu
I want to do what a man does	Irrid nagħmel dak li jagħmel raġel
I'm a bit worried.	Jien inkwetat daqsxejn.
Whatever you want.	Tkun xi trid.
He couldn't see anything.	Ma seta’ jara xejn.
And there was something.	U kien hemm xi ħaġa.
Not just me.	Mhux jien biss.
I didn’t know all that was about	Ma kontx naf dak kollu li kien dwar
It's just too good.	Huwa biss wisq tajjeb.
Look at the time.	Ħares lejn il-ħin.
I couldn't go back, I couldn't go back	Ma stajtx immur lura, ma kontx immur lura
I'm too scared.	Jien nibża’ wisq.
I need to know what's going on	Għandi bżonn inkun naf x'qed jiġri
And now you're so good to me.	U issa int daqshekk tajjeb miegħi.
He has me worried.	Huwa għandu lili inkwetat.
But it was so bad.	Imma kien daqshekk ħażin.
I can understand why it was so	Kapaċi nifhem għaliex kien hekk
I was thinking, if you knew.	Kont qed naħseb, kieku taf.
More than anything else.	Aktar minn kull ħaġa oħra.
I thought he would for sure	Ħsibt li kieku żgur
I did nothing wrong	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin
They were there.	Kienu hemm fuq.
Not that she will be able to for a long time.	Mhux li hi se tkun kapaċi għal żmien twil.
You are either not or you are not.	Int jew m'intix jew m'intix.
He did this for three years.	Dan għamel għal tliet snin.
It was very, very small.	Kien żgħir ħafna, ħafna.
Now, you do.	Issa, inti tagħmel.
They never were.	Qatt ma kienu.
I think it was wrong	Naħseb li kien ħażin
It’s definitely big enough for all that.	Huwa żgur kbir biżżejjed għal dak kollu.
I didn't have to.	I ma kellux.
It's a good thing.	Hija ħaġa tajba.
This is not your home.	Din mhix id-dar tiegħek.
Maybe you will.	Forsi inti se.
I still couldn't believe it happened	Għadni ma stajtx nemmen li ġara
I was having fun.	Kont qed nieħu gost.
I want him to keep talking	Irrid li jibqa’ jitkellem
No one was seeing anything.	Ħadd ma kien jara xejn.
Once it was mine.	Darba kienet tiegħi.
I'm worried about it	Jien inkwetat dwarha
It's a lot.	Huwa ħafna.
But she didn't know.	Imma hi ma kinitx taf.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
I have a son.	Għandi tifel.
I wasn’t sure what to say.	Ma kontx ċert x'se ngħid.
I want to be a teacher.	Irrid inkun għalliem.
Not bad but not great.	Mhux ħażin imma mhux kbir.
I want to see me.	Irrid nara jien.
I think it looks good	Naħseb li jidher tajjeb
I shouldn't be here either	Lanqas għandi nkun hawn
I still really regret it.	Għadni tassew jiddispjaċini għal dan.
I went when I went outside.	Jien mort meta mar barra.
I think we should go to his house	Naħseb li għandna mmorru lejn id-dar tiegħu
I don't have long to wait	M'għandix twil nistenna
It’s really something you want to think about.	Hija tassew xi ħaġa li trid taħseb dwarha.
I have no idea what this is.	M'għandi l-ebda idea dwar x'inhu dan.
He is doing so.	Hekk qed jagħmel.
I would be alone.	Inkun waħdi.
What no one really knew was why he had done this.	Dak li ħadd ma kien verament jaf kien għaliex kien għamel dan.
I can't understand.	Ma nistax nifhem.
I saw some people there	Rajt xi nies hemmhekk
I think they are right	Naħseb li għandhom raġun
Everything will work.	Kollox se jaħdem.
We know it’s been there too long.	Nafu li ilu hemm wisq.
She wouldn’t have been the first.	Hija ma kinitx tkun l-ewwel.
I didn’t think so	Ma kontx ħsibt
But let's get here.	Imma ejja hawn.
But we don’t have that anymore.	Imma m'għandniex hekk aktar.
I can't see normally	Ma nistax nara normalment
Just not now.	Biss mhux issa.
I have an idea.	Għandi idea.
This happened every time.	Dan ġara kull darba.
That’s not the same thing.	Dik mhix l-istess ħaġa.
I knew he would do it	Kont naf li se jagħmel dan
If you have any.	Jekk għandek xi.
I loved that book.	Kont inħobb dak il-ktieb.
I was too busy.	Jien kont okkupat wisq.
He knows that.	Hu jaf li.
I like to see it that way.	Inħobb nara hekk.
I want to try something	Irrid nipprova xi ħaġa
You have to do the same thing.	Għandek tagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
I knew what was going on	Kont naf x’kien ġara
I'm not surprised.	Jien mhux sorpriż.
I said this over and over again.	Għidt dan darba u darba.
I always knew what was going on	Dejjem kont naf x’qed jiġri
I didn’t know what you were thinking	Ma kontx naf x'qed taħseb
He was starting to have fun.	Kien beda jieħu gost.
I know what's right for you	Naf x'inhu tajjeb għalik
I wanted to see it all.	Ridt nara dan kollu.
I’m glad he does	Jien ferħan li jagħmel hekk
I must be watching things	I għandu jkun qed nara l-affarijiet
I wonder where she was last night	Nistaqsi fejn kienet ilbieraħ filgħaxija
She was the one who was right.	Kienet dik li kellha raġun.
I don’t want this for anyone	Jien ma nixtieq dan għal ħadd
I thought he was already here	Ħsibt li jkun diġà hawn
But that was too much.	Imma dan kien wisq.
And it wasn’t him.	U ma kienx hu.
That was it.	Kien dak li hi.
I was afraid to be alone with him	Kont nibża’ li nkun waħdi miegħu
I’ve said this before.	Jien għidt dan qabel.
I wait, until you are ready.	Nistenna, sakemm tkun lest.
Nothing is nothing.	Xejn mhu xejn.
But no, he wanted to play with me.	Imma le, ried jilgħab miegħi.
You don’t need to do anything else.	M'għandekx bżonn tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
It's just that this is so difficult.	Huwa biss li dan huwa tant diffiċli.
We did a lot.	Għamilna ħafna.
I thought about tonight	Ħsibt dwar illejla
It was so hard.	Kien daqshekk diffiċli.
I want to do this for myself	Irrid nagħmel dan għalija
He was starting to look tired.	Kien beda jidher għajjien.
And now you're telling me about it.	U issa qed tgħidli dwarha.
I can’t believe how much he is	Ma nistax nemmen kemm hu
I had to do more	I kellha tagħmel aktar
I'm not sure how this is happening.	M'inix ċert kif dan qed jiġri.
I saw it all	Rajt dak kollu
That’s what I was supposed to do.	Dak hu li suppost kont tagħmel.
There is not much you can do about it.	M'hemm xejn ħafna li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
That's pretty good.	Dak pjuttost tajjeb.
It's pretty much around there.	Huwa pjuttost madwar hemm.
But there was no way to be sure.	Imma ma kien hemm l-ebda mod kif tkun ċert.
I have to say something to everyone	Ikolli ngħid xi ħaġa lil kulħadd
I heard that	Jien smajt dan
But it was too much.	Imma kien wisq.
He was the only one who did.	Kien l-uniku wieħed li għamel.
I wanted to do this before, but I didn't know how.	Ridt nagħmel dan qabel, imma ma kontx naf kif.
Definitely not good.	Żgur li ma kontx tajjeb.
It's so big.	Huwa daqshekk kbir.
I just wanted to tell her	Ridt biss ngħid hi
You have money.	Għandek flus.
There was just nothing.	Biss ma kien hemm xejn.
That was what happened.	Kien dak li sar.
You are doing a lot for me here.	Qed tagħmel ħafna għalija hawn.
I couldn’t go back to that	Ma stajtx immur lura għal dak
I'm afraid not	Nibża li mhux
It works well for me.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb għalija.
But that wasn’t really it.	Imma dan ma kienx verament.
Sometimes it wasn’t.	Xi drabi ma kinitx.
He didn't want to.	Ma riedx.
I was just, you know	Kont biss, taf
I should know that by this time without question	Għandi naf li sa dan iż-żmien mingħajr ma nistaqsi
I was really busy	Jien kont tassew okkupat
She played me.	Hija kellha lili.
I want to do other things for a while.	Irrid nagħmel affarijiet oħra għal xi żmien.
I was going to school alone	Kont sejjer l-iskola waħdi
You’re so much more than that.	Int ħafna aktar minn hekk.
I didn’t know about that	Ma kontx naf dwar dan
And there you were.	U kien hemm int.
I hope it won’t be too late	Nittama li mhux se jkun tard wisq
I can't go back there again	Ma nistax immur lura hemm darba oħra
Not so much anymore.	Mhux daqshekk aktar.
And she is seated.	U hi bilqiegħda.
He is afraid of that and only hopes that.	Jibża’ minn hekk u jittama li biss.
I would be here if you need anything.	Jien inkun hawn jekk għandek bżonn xi ħaġa.
I couldn’t wait any longer	Ma stajtx nistenna aktar minn hekk
I think he wants to talk to you	Naħseb li jrid jitkellem miegħek
It's just that.	Hija xi ħaġa li biss.
But it wasn’t too bad.	Imma ma kienx ħażin wisq.
He can do whatever he wants, now.	Jista’ jagħmel dak kollu li jrid, kif irid, issa.
It was really on tonight.	Kienet tassew fuq illejla.
That’s what should happen.	Dak hu li għandu jiġri.
I didn’t want to tell you	Ma ridtx ngħidlek
I never thought I would come to this	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jasal għal dan
I was trying to have fun	Kont qed nipprova nagħmel gost
It's hard to say.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid.
One soon does not know what to do next.	Wieħed dalwaqt ma jkunx jaf x'għandu jagħmel wara.
Now he wasn’t so sure.	Issa ma kienx daqshekk ċert.
I never want anything to do with him	Jien qatt ma rrid għal xejn miegħu
It does a lot of things.	Jagħmel ħafna affarijiet.
I think it was pretty good	Naħseb li kien pjuttost tajjeb
But apparently it was.	Imma milli jidher kien.
I wasn't even sure what was going on	Lanqas kont ċert x’kien qed jiġri
No one can ever be the first.	Ħadd qatt ma jista’ jkun l-ewwel.
Everything you want is.	Kull ħaġa li trid hija.
There is another idea.	Hemm idea oħra.
I'm not staying here	Jien mhux noqgħod hawn
And it is, for some time.	U huwa, għal xi żmien.
Every man wants one of these.	Kull raġel irid wieħed minn dawn.
Lots of time	Ħafna ħin
He could never do it again.	Qatt ma seta’ jerġa’.
I will get back to you as soon as possible.	Jien se nerġa' lura kemm jista' jkun malajr.
This was the same.	Dan kien l-istess.
You will be glad you did.	Int tkun ferħan li għamilt.
He didn’t even want to think about it.	Lanqas biss ried jaħseb dwarha.
This will be long.	Dan se jkun twil.
There is a lot of help out there.	Hemm ħafna għajnuna hemmhekk.
I’m sure you want to talk	Jien ċert li trid titkellem
It's not as bad as it used to be.	Mhuwiex ħażin daqs.
I love talking to you	Inħobb nitkellem miegħek
He may be telling the truth.	Jista’ jkun qed jgħid il-verità.
I do work that no one wants to do	Nagħmel ix-xogħol li ħadd ma jrid jagħmel
There is.	Hemm.
He was so happy.	Huwa kien tant kuntent.
I have no problem with that	M'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan
It really wasn't much.	Verament ma kienx ħafna.
I believe this is wrong	Nemmen li dan huwa ħażin
I thought you were coming to me.	Ħsibt li ġejt għandi.
No not.	Le mhux.
I have some work for you	Għandi xi xogħol għalik
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwar dan.
I think he knows where this is going.	Naħseb li jaf fejn sejjer dan.
He shouldn’t be doing it alone.	M'għandux ikun qed jagħmel dan waħdu.
I didn't want to go back	Ma ridtx li jerġa’ lura
I also know you’ve been doing what you always do	Naf ukoll li kont qed tagħmel dak li dejjem tagħmel
I had no idea what was going on	Ma kellix idea ta’ x’qed jiġri
I was sure he could take more	Kont ċert li seta’ jieħu aktar
He knows how.	Jaf kif.
I never think when I do anything more	Qatt ma naħseb meta nagħmel xi ħaġa aktar
I’ve been able to do that as well	Jien stajt nagħmel hekk ukoll
I would say it was him.	Jien ngħid li kien hu.
I have to be back this afternoon	Jien għandi nkun lura llum wara nofsinhar
From every single thing	Minn kull ħaġa waħda
I was not surprised.	Ma kontx sorpriż.
I was glad to be out there	Kont ferħan li nkun barra minn hemm
I know it must be hard for you	Naf li trid tkun diffiċli għalik
I didn’t see anything.	Jiena ma rajt xejn.
I don’t want to wait any longer	Ma rridx nistenna aktar
I'm having a hard time	Qed ikolli żmien diffiċli
So do you.	Hekk tagħmel int.
It didn’t look good.	Ma deherx tajjeb.
I need to go to school	Għandi bżonn immur l-iskola
And what it is, is this.	U dak li hu, huwa dan.
And they always do.	U dejjem jagħmlu dan.
I’m not going to say more about that.	Jien mhux se ngħid aktar dwar dan.
I don't even know what to say about that.	Lanqas naf x’se ngħid dwar dak.
They were years, you see.	Kienu snin, tara.
You don't need anything else.	M'għandekx bżonn xi ħaġa oħra.
I know this now.	Naf dan issa.
Early in the morning.	Kmieni filgħodu.
I had seen this before and recently	Kont rajt dan qabel u dan l-aħħar
I'm not listening	Jien m'iniex biex nisma'
I can see why he thought that.	Nista’ nara għaliex ħaseb dan.
I didn’t even want to try to be happy here.	Lanqas ridt nipprova nkun kuntent hawn.
I will not speak today	Mhux se nitkellem illum
I expect it to be very busy tomorrow	Nistenna li għada tkun okkupat ħafna
I could hear what you were saying	Stajt nisma’ x’qed tgħid
This is another time.	Dan huwa żmien ieħor.
You have to do it.	Int trid tagħmel dan.
Not a big deal.	Mhux ħaġa kbira.
I can’t believe what you did for me	Ma nistax nemmen dak li għamilt għalija
But it was also something else.	Imma kienet ukoll xi ħaġa oħra.
It's time.	Wasal iż-żmien.
I can't say that now	Ma nistax ngħid hekk issa
But he died.	Imma miet.
Everything was there.	Kollox kien hemm.
I thought I would be happy.	Ħsibt li jkun kuntent.
I was wrong, you see.	Jien kont ħażin, tara.
And who knows, he thought.	U min jaf, ħaseb.
Or was it.	Jew kien.
I need to be with you	Għandi bżonn inkun miegħek
But maybe a lot of work has been done.	Imma forsi sar ħafna xogħol.
Soon, it’s time to move on.	Dalwaqt, wasal iż-żmien li tmur.
I want to go there too	Irrid immur hemm ukoll
I actually wanted to go with him	Fil-fatt ridt immur miegħu
You were right.	Kellek raġun.
I'm listening now.	Qed nisma' issa.
But she didn't, of course.	Imma hi ma, ovvjament.
And not just you.	U mhux int biss.
It should work.	Għandu jaħdem.
And for me that says a lot.	U għalija dan jgħid ħafna.
That was good.	Dak kien tajjeb.
you think.	int taħseb.
There is nothing we can do about it.	M'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu għalih.
I had been there for hours	Kont ilni sigħat
I am having a great time	Qed nagħmel ħin tajjeb ħafna
Nor is she doing it.	Lanqas hi li tagħmel dan.
You can't.	Ma tistax int.
No not really.	Le mhux verament.
Pretty good, too.	Pjuttost tajjeb, ukoll.
And it wasn’t.	U ma kienx.
We need friends and we need to be friends.	Għandna bżonn ħbieb u jeħtieġ li nkunu ħabib.
Well you are supposed to be.	Ukoll inti suppost tkun.
It's his and mine.	Huwa tiegħu u tiegħi.
I knew this was going to happen.	Kont naf li dan kien se jiġri.
That first time he said nothing.	Dik l-ewwel darba ma qal xejn.
As far as he could.	Sa fejn seta’.
And probably would.	U probabbilment kieku.
It was something.	Kienet xi ħaġa.
Not only that.	Mhux biss.
Yours, if you will.	Tiegħek, jekk trid.
I meant.	Ridt ngħid.
It won't be long now.	Ma jkunx twil issa.
It could be his job again.	Jista 'jkun ix-xogħol tiegħu mill-ġdid.
I did pretty well.	Jien għamilt pjuttost tajjeb.
I think he probably does	Naħseb li probabbilment jagħmel
I have no idea why this is.	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex dan hu.
Maybe too much.	Forsi wisq.
I couldn’t take that back	Ma stajtx nieħu dik lura
He never goes to school one.	Hu qatt ma jmur l-iskola waħda.
I had nothing to say	Ma kelli xejn xi ngħid
Or is it on the outside.	Jew huwa fuq barra.
He is a good man.	Huwa raġel tajjeb.
This probably works pretty well.	Dan probabbilment jaħdem pjuttost tajjeb.
I can’t imagine why this happened	Ma nistax naħseb għaliex ġara dan
He is never tired.	Hu qatt ma għajjien.
I never had that.	Qatt ma kelli dak.
He seems happy there.	Jidher kuntent hemmhekk.
We'll do something else.	Aħna ser nagħmlu xi ħaġa oħra.
I doubt he knows, but we know	Niddubita li jaf, imma nafu
Now you do.	Issa inti tagħmel.
This can be, too.	Dan jista 'jkun, ukoll.
Not many people do that.	Mhux ħafna nies jagħmlu hekk.
I'm alone.	Jien waħdi.
I didn’t see any of that yesterday	Jien ma rajt xejn minn hekk ilbieraħ
He didn’t want us to go.	Ma riedx li mmorru.
I’m not sure it’s a good idea.	M'inix ċert li hija idea tajba.
No, no, no.	Mhux, mhux, mhux.
I go back and forth on this	Immur lura u lura fuq dan
Wherever you want.	Kull fejn trid.
He said everything he could.	Qal dak kollu li jista’.
I can tell you anything	Nista’ ngħidlek tkun xi tkun
Tell me one thing.	Tgħidli ħaġa waħda.
I will never do anything like that again.	Qatt ma nerġa nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I know what he will do	Naf x'se jagħmel
And we will know soon.	U nafu dalwaqt.
I believe.	Jien nemmen.
But everyone does it.	Imma kulħadd jagħmel dan.
I knew he was thinking about it	Kont naf li kien qed jaħseb dwarha
I'm just a little tired	Jien biss ftit għajjien
He was just a boy.	Kien biss tifel.
It will not be so difficult.	Mhux se jkun daqshekk diffiċli.
I have problems with this one.	Għandi problemi ma 'dan wieħed.
I never did anything else.	Qatt ma għamilt xi ħaġa oħra.
I would go back	Nixtieq lura
I'm going.	Jien se mmur.
He was a boy.	Kien tifel.
I can't wait for anyone	Ma nista’ nistenna lil ħadd
I did years.	Għamilt snin.
He is still young.	Għadu żgħir.
To be nobody.	Biex ma tkun ħadd.
He was worried about her.	Huwa kien inkwetat dwarha.
I want that to happen to me	Irrid li jiġri lili
And there was a lot of work now for everyone.	U kien hemm ħafna xogħol issa għal kulħadd.
It had happened so long ago.	Kien ġara tant ilu.
I'm surprised, very surprised to hear this	Jien sorpriż, sorpriż ħafna meta nisma' dan
You have to come.	Trid tiġi.
He is a great man.	Huwa raġel kbir.
I will not do otherwise now.	Jien mhux se nagħmel mod ieħor issa.
That’s not what’s happening here.	Dak mhux dak li qed jiġri hawn.
I didn’t see anything or anyone	Jien ma rajt xejn jew lil ħadd
You are the same with everyone.	Int l-istess ma’ kulħadd.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx hekk.
Much easier than it looks	Ħafna aktar faċli milli jidher
No, there is nothing there.	Le, m'hemm xejn hemmhekk.
I don't know what to do.	Ma nafx nagħmel.
Some people have everything.	Xi nies għandhom kollox.
Not that what she was doing, really.	Mhux li dak li kienet qed tagħmel, tassew.
I'll think about that later	Naħseb dwar dan aktar tard
One does not want to.	Wieħed ma jridx.
It couldn’t be that way.	Ma setax ikun hekk.
I think I’ve done something.	Naħseb li stajt għamilt xi ħaġa.
This can happen.	Dan jista' jiġri.
I want to tell someone.	Irrid ngħid lil xi ħadd.
They were more like people.	Kienu aktar bħal nies.
I've never been there before	Qatt ma kont hemm qabel
We are not.	Aħna le.
I would be afraid to try.	Inkun nibża' nipprova jien.
He was not there.	Hu ma kienx hemm.
It probably won't be.	Huwa probabbilment mhux se jkun.
He could do something.	Seta’ jagħmel xi ħaġa.
It works pretty well.	Jaħdem pjuttost tajjeb.
She just had to.	Hija kellha biss.
I will not do that again	Mhux se nerġa' nagħmel hekk
He really was a good man.	Huwa tassew kien raġel tajjeb.
He knew he was wrong.	Kien jaf li kien ħażin.
I was worried, you know	Kont inkwetat, taf
I want everything he said and more	Irrid dak kollu li qal u aktar
There was something to that.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa għal dak.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all	Mod aħjar kif tgħid li le, m'għandekx
That now.	Dak issa.
I was never the same	Qatt ma kont l-istess
But you obviously do.	Imma inti ovvjament tagħmel.
He was right !.	Kellu raġun!.
Not my job.	Mhux ix-xogħol tiegħi.
I had never seen anything so beautiful.	Qatt ma kien ra xi ħaġa daqshekk sabiħa.
I have no idea about this problem	M'għandi l-ebda idea dwar din il-problema
This is good.	Dan huwa tajjeb.
I’ve never seen anything like that happen before	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal dik jiġri qabel
It seemed long ago.	Deher twil ilu.
I didn’t know.	Ma kontx naf.
I say this here and now	Jien ngħid dan hawn u issa
I don't want to know	Ma rridx inkun naf
I made a friend	Għamilt ħabib
Ask if it can be.	Staqsa jekk jistax jiġi.
I just want us to be together.	Irrid biss li nkunu flimkien.
But she did much more than that.	Imma għamlet ħafna aktar minn hekk.
I didn’t always think so	Mhux dejjem ħsibt hekk
It could be anything.	Jista 'jkun xejn.
You do the work.	Int tagħmel ix-xogħol.
Not ahead of time.	Mhux qabel iż-żmien.
It was never about that.	Qatt ma kien dwar dan.
I can tell you, yours can be, too	Nista 'ngħidlek, tiegħek jista' jkun, ukoll
They just do work.	Huma biss jagħmlu xogħol.
I wasn't sure what happened	Ma kontx ċert x’ġara
I thought I’d stay here, with you	Ħsibt li noqgħod hawn, miegħek
I can say he was tired	Nista 'ngħid li kien għajjien
This is happening.	Dan qed jiġri.
I couldn’t take it anymore	Ma stajtx nieħu aktar
If it were easy, everyone would do it.	Kieku kien faċli, kulħadd jagħmel dan.
I want something else	Irrid xi ħaġa oħra
I think everyone was happy with that	Naħseb li kulħadd kien ferħan b’dan
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
We have.	Aħna għandna.
I can't understand what it is.	Ma nistax nifhem x'inhu.
Not much anyone can do about it.	Mhux wisq xi ħadd jista 'jagħmel dwar dan.
I had had enough of this.	Kelli biżżejjed minn dan.
It could be another.	Jista’ jkun ieħor.
I was quite surprised and happy	Kont pjuttost sorpriż u kuntent
I didn’t know it was happening	Ma kontx naf li kien qed jiġri
I have no idea what he was doing there	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'kien qed jagħmel hemmhekk
Well, it is.	Ukoll, huwa.
I understand things.	Nifhem l-affarijiet.
And they do.	U jagħmlu.
I couldn’t wait to see what would happen next	Ma stajtx nistenna biex nara x'se jiġri wara
I needed to think more about it, later maybe	Kelli bżonn naħseb aktar dwarha, aktar tard forsi
I really wish there was another way	Nixtieq verament li jkun hemm mod ieħor
I can't do that	Ma nistax nagħmel dan
I have no idea what's going on	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'qed jiġri
I would be alone.	Inkun waħdi.
I will buy again here	Se nerġa' nixtri hawn
That would be good.	Dak ikun tajjeb.
I wasn't sure you did	Ma kontx ċert li inti tagħmel dan
I thought it was good	Ħsibt li kien tajjeb
There was no such thing as always.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda ħaġa bħal dejjem.
It's still there.	Għadek hemm.
There is also.	Hemm ukoll.
To think it has arrived.	Biex taħseb li wasal.
I think they are better now	Naħseb li huma aħjar issa
It had a size.	Kellu daqs.
It was so much more.	Kien ħafna aktar.
I think a lot about it	Naħseb ħafna dwar dan
I see where you are, and what you want	Nara fejn int, u dak li trid
It would also be unnecessary.	Ikun ukoll bla bżonn.
It's so bad.	Huwa daqshekk ħażin.
The.	Le.
I think you like it.	Naħseb li tixtieq.
I knew what was coming	Kont naf x’kien ġej
I tell you, but no one else.	Jien ngħidlek, imma ħadd ieħor.
I wish I was there	Nixtieq li kont hemm
I think it would have been	Naħseb li kien ikun
It still works.	Għadu jaħdem.
Just not the same people all the time.	Biss mhux l-istess nies il-ħin kollu.
I think he will win more	Naħseb li se jirbaħ aktar
I hope that happens.	Nispera li jiġri.
I couldn't try any more	Ma stajtx nipprova aktar
I'm not there yet.	Għadni m'iniex hemm.
You don’t even know how bad it was.	Lanqas taf kemm kienet ħażina.
And this he will have to do.	U dan se jkollu jagħmel.
I think they were pretty right	Naħseb li kienu pjuttost raġun
What is it ?.	X'inhu?.
I need to hear that	Għandi bżonn nisma' dak
I was the first person ready.	Jien kont l-ewwel persuna lest.
You know better.	Taf aħjar.
It's just not who she is.	Huwa biss mhux min hi.
It's just there.	Huwa biss hemm.
When, she didn't know.	Meta, hija ma kinitx taf.
Something more than.	Xi ħaġa aktar minn.
I know you already know that	Naf li diġà taf dan
He saw how big he was.	Huwa ra kemm kien kbir.
Everyone does when the time comes.	Kulħadd jagħmel meta jasal iż-żmien.
I know there is.	Naf li hemm.
I go from person to thing	Jiena mmur minn persuna għal ħaġa
Maybe more.	Forsi aktar.
I could never go home	Qatt ma stajt immur id-dar
It was going to be great.	Kien se jkun kbir.
And it came.	U wasal.
Sorry for what happened	Jiddispjaċini għal dak li ġara
It had to be.	Kellu jkun.
That’s great for you.	Dak hu kbir għalik.
There was something.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa.
It was the last time.	Kienet l-aħħar darba.
I can only try this once	Nista' nipprova dan darba biss
I have no idea what this is	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'inhu dan
I thought there would be more	Ħsibt li jkun hemm aktar
I know a lot about this	Naf ħafna dwar dan
I am still today.	Għadni llum.
I wanted to be with him	Ridt inkun miegħu
I wonder what that was about	Nistaqsi dak li kien dwar
Maybe you can do that.	Forsi tkun tista’ tagħmel dan.
And we didn’t even know it.	U lanqas biss konna nafu.
I know they are capable	Naf li huma kapaċi
It seems to work very well.	Jidher li jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
It's not that.	Mhuwiex dak.
Where it was.	Fejn kien.
And that's good.	U dan huwa tajjeb.
I have money, a lot of money	Għandi flus, ħafna flus
In fact, it’s not a bad idea.	Fil-fatt, mhix idea ħażina.
I know you want to be tired	Naf li trid tkun għajjien
It happens here all the time.	Jiġri hawn il-ħin kollu.
He didn’t want to be here.	Ma riedx ikun hawn.
I have been saying this for many years	Ilni ngħid dan għal ħafna snin
No one knows about everything.	Ħadd ma jaf dwar kollox.
That wasn’t good enough.	Dak ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed.
And if not.	U jekk le.
As it looks now.	Ta’ kif kienet tidher issa.
I won't know where it is until noon	Mhux se naf fejn hu sa nofsinhar
Probably not.	Probabbilment dan mhux hekk.
I still want it that way.	Għadni rrid hekk.
I want you to know how to do both	Irrid li tkun taf kif tagħmel it-tnejn
She knew nothing.	Ma kienet taf xejn.
The things you can do.	L-affarijiet li tista 'tagħmel.
It didn't have to be that way either.	Ma kellux għalfejn ikun hekk lanqas.
There is no way to do that.	M'hemm l-ebda mod kif tagħmel dan.
She had to think of something like that.	Hi kellha taħseb xi ħaġa bħal dik.
And he was.	U kien kien.
This may not be easy.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx faċli.
I just need to think about it	Għandi bżonn biss li taħseb dwarha
Or before it was.	Jew qabel kien.
I already knew the truth	Diġà kont naf il-verità
He will not speak again.	Hu mhux se jerġa 'jitkellem.
I did so.	Jien għamilt hekk.
And it should work.	U għandu jaħdem.
You made your home there.	Int għamilt id-dar tiegħek hemmhekk.
I know about these things.	Naf dwar dawn l-affarijiet.
Now we seem to know.	Issa jidher li nafu.
I didn’t have to wait	Ma kellix nistenna
I don’t think there is one.	Ma naħsibx li hemm waħda.
I know exactly how he is	Naf eżatt kif hu
It may be a little busy today.	Jista’ jkun li jkun ftit okkupat illum.
Wherever he looked, it looked the same.	Kull fejn ħares, deher l-istess.
This is not the time.	Dan mhux dak iż-żmien.
I knew it was a big deal	Kont naf li kienet ħaġa kbira
I think.	Naħseb.
I just want to understand why	Irrid nifhem biss għaliex
It took hours and hours.	Ħa sigħat u sigħat.
I had to do it again	Kelli nerġa’ nagħmel
I never went back.	Qatt ma mort lura.
It’s too late for me but maybe not for you.	Huwa tard wisq għalija imma forsi ma jkunx għalik.
I could understand how they felt	Stajt nifhem kif ħassu
Until he died.	Sakemm miet.
That couldn’t be done, either.	Dan ma setax isir, lanqas.
This book does just that.	Dan il-ktieb jagħmel hekk.
But that time passed.	Imma dak iż-żmien għadda.
It may be already.	Jista 'jkun diġà.
I don't have the time right now	M'għandix il-ħin bħalissa
You are not happy.	M'intix kuntent.
Now he couldn’t.	Issa ma setax.
I wonder what it was about.	Nistaqsi dak li kien dwar.
And after that.	U wara dak.
I'm not too worried.	Jien mhux wisq inkwetat.
I’m sure this is not my time	Jien ċert li dan mhux il-ħin tiegħi
Here's another one.	Hawn ieħor.
They both need help, quickly.	Dawn it-tnejn għandhom bżonn l-għajnuna, malajr.
There is something.	Hemm xi ħaġa.
But it happens every time.	Imma jiġri kull darba.
I know everyone is for it	Naf li kulħadd huwa għal dan
It was too big.	Kien kbir wisq.
She wasn't talking much.	Ma tantx kienet qed titkellem.
I couldn’t understand how she was doing this	Ma stajtx nifhem kif kienet qed tagħmel dan
Everyone has that.	Kulħadd għandu dak.
Something could happen.	Jista’ jiġri xi ħaġa.
You can, and you want to.	Tista’, u trid.
I know you want that too	Naf li trid hekk ukoll
I don't know.	Ma nafx.
It does for me.	Jagħmel għalija.
It was so hard so hard so hard.	Kien daqshekk diffiċli tant diffiċli tant diffiċli.
I was going to do that	Kont se nagħmel dan
It won’t be my last.	Mhux se jkun l-aħħar tiegħi.
I think it turned out well	Naħseb li ħareġ tajjeb
I didn't want to see anyone	Ma ridt nara lil ħadd
For me, it was great.	Għalija, kien kbir.
If I had, I would have left already.	Kieku kont, kont telaq diġà.
He must have done something right.	Għandu jkun għamel xi ħaġa tajba.
I'm what you want.	Jien dak li trid.
It's always late.	Hija dejjem tard.
I want that.	Irrid dak.
I take enough to wait and see	Jien nieħu biżżejjed biex nistenna u nara
From there now.	Minn hemm issa.
I didn’t do anything wrong here	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin hawn
I still believe that today.	Għadni nemmen li llum.
I know I saw everything	Naf li rajt kollox
He went that way	Huwa mar mod hemmhekk
I have been saying this for a long time	Ilni rrid ngħid hekk
I have money, a lot of money	Għandi flus, ħafna flus
Some before as well.	Xi qabel ukoll.
That is a reason.	Dan huwa raġun.
And he won't.	U hu mhux se.
I've been here.	Stajt hawn.
I think she always had	Naħseb li dejjem kellha
He was absolutely right.	Kellu raġun kollu.
He really is who we are.	Huwa verament min aħna.
Maybe he didn't want to.	Forsi ma tantx ried.
That’s not what you’re saying.	Dan mhux dak li qed tgħid.
I have no idea how to try.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif nipprova.
Only one problem.	Problema waħda biss.
Everything was working fine.	Kollox kien qed jaħdem tajjeb.
You know my job.	Inti taf ix-xogħol tiegħi.
Someone was out there.	Xi ħadd kien hemm barra.
You know how this works.	Taf kif jaħdem dan.
I quickly thought better.	Malajr ħsibt aħjar.
It was quite small.	Kien pjuttost żgħir.
It was nothing that he expected.	Ma kien xejn dak li kien jistenna.
I can take whatever happens	Nista' nieħu dak kollu li jiġri
Maybe it was all these things.	Jista’ jkun li kienu dawn l-affarijiet kollha.
And there was no one for a long, long time.	U ma kien hemm ħadd għal żmien twil, twil.
I couldn't do it anymore	Ma stajtx nagħmel aktar
I don’t know who she is.	Ma nafx min hi.
I didn’t want to do that	Ma ridtx nagħmel hekk
I’ve seen it that way too.	Jien rajt hekk ukoll.
He was always more interested in having fun.	Dejjem kien aktar interessat li jieħu gost.
You don’t do that.	Ma tagħmilx hekk.
I have never thought about this before	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan qabel
Its, as it were.	Tiegħu, kif kien.
I think everything comes next.	Naħseb li ġej dak kollu li ġej.
I didn’t want to.	Ma ridtx.
And that's what you are.	U dan huwa dak li int.
And, you can do that.	U, tista 'tagħmel dan.
I want to talk to you so much	Jien tant irrid nitkellem miegħek
But not with me.	Imma mhux miegħi.
That’s how everything works.	Hekk jaħdem kollox.
I can't say for sure what it is	Ma nistax ngħid żgur x'inhu
Tomorrow may be too late.	Għada jista' jkun tard wisq.
Maybe you just need someone to do it for you.	Forsi għandek bżonn biss li xi ħadd jagħmel dan għalik.
I was small and.	Kont żgħir u.
I couldn't speak or think	Ma stajtx nitkellem jew naħseb
It would not be so easy.	Ma jkunx daqshekk faċli.
I’m nothing and everything.	Jien xejn u kollox.
It will not be the same.	Mhux se jkun l-istess.
We can do this quickly, if you want.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan malajr, jekk trid.
I had to make things better	Kelli nagħmel l-affarijiet aħjar
After doing so, he left.	Wara li għamel dan, telaq.
I just hope we can.	Nispera biss li nistgħu.
I had it a year ago.	Kelli sena ilu.
Come on out.	Ejja barra.
I didn’t know there was such a thing	Ma kontx naf li kien hemm xi ħaġa bħal din
I wasn’t like that.	Jien ma kontx hekk.
I don’t even ask, but you know.	Lanqas nistaqsi, imma taf.
Well, he says.	Ukoll, huwa jgħid.
He wants something more.	Irid xi ħaġa aktar.
I really want to know.	Nixtieq tassew inkun naf.
He was not going.	Ma kienx imur.
It will not help.	Mhux se jgħin.
Maybe not so.	Forsi lanqas hekk.
Forever.	Għal dejjem.
I need to think more about it.	Għandi bżonn naħseb aktar dwarha.
I know you know who she is	Naf li taf min hi
But really, he never got there.	Imma tassew, qatt ma wasal hemm.
I just want the truth.	Irrid biss il-verità.
I would be very happy	Inkun kuntent ħafna
He has to.	Huwa għandu.
It was good.	Kienet tajba.
I needed this to go	Jien kelli bżonn dan biex immur
I'm fine, he said.	Jien tajjeb, qal.
There was something wrong.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa ħażina.
I would go there someday	Nixtieq immur hemm xi darba
I had never really thought about it before	Qatt ma kont verament ħsibt dwarha qabel
I’ve been thinking about it all morning	Ilni naħseb dwarha filgħodu kollha
I look forward to it.	Nistenna li nistenna.
I was no more.	Ma kontx aktar.
It may never have been ready.	Jista’ jkun li qatt ma kien lest.
Well, that never happened.	Ukoll, dan qatt ma ġara.
But nothing ever seemed to work.	Imma xejn qatt ma deher li jaħdem.
I know he will try something	Naf li se jipprova xi ħaġa
I still can't talk about it	Għadni ma nistax nitkellem dwarha
But I can’t understand why this is happening.	Imma ma nistax nifhem għaliex qed jiġri dan.
I didn’t know that, actually	Ma kontx naf li, fil-fatt
And that was the problem.	U dik kienet il-problema.
I can't do that.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan.
There is usually more.	Normalment ikun hemm aktar.
I can also try this	Nista 'ukoll nipprova dan
It would have been so easy.	Kien ikun daqshekk faċli.
I did it.	Għamilt dan.
I have seen many things here	Rajt ħafna affarijiet hawn
It never appeared.	Qatt ma deher.
I came to talk to you	Ġejt nitkellem miegħek
This is more likely.	Dan huwa aktar probabbli.
But something.	Imma xi ħaġa.
We are friends.	Aħna ħbieb.
So I wasn't ready for that	Jien hekk ma kontx lest għal dan
I thought, no.	Ħsibt, le.
You can't either.	Inti ma tistax lanqas.
I see what no one else can	Nara dak li ħadd ieħor ma jista’
But he did not know enough about such things.	Imma ma kienx jaf biżżejjed dwar affarijiet bħal dawn.
I don’t think it’s going to be a problem, but you never know.	Ma naħsibx li se tkun problema, imma qatt ma tkun taf.
I knew of course it wasn't for me	Kont naf ovvjament li ma kienx għalija
I can see what's coming	Nista’ nara x’qed jiġi
He thought it was great.	Ħaseb li kien kbir.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Ma rridx nitkellem dwarha.
I was good.	Kont tajjeb.
I can't understand anything.	Ma nistax nifhem xi ħaġa.
I wanted to be you	Ridt li tkun int
I knew better than to ask	Kont naf aħjar milli nistaqsi
I went there just a few years ago	Jien mort hemm biss ftit snin ilu
I think it probably was me	Naħseb li probabbilment kont jien
I still have no idea.	Għadni m'għandi l-ebda idea.
I was here today.	Jien kont hawn illum.
I thought, this is for me	Ħsibt, dan huwa għalija
I had this before.	Kelli dan qabel.
I thought of something	Ħsibt xi ħaġa
But he knew what was going on.	Imma kien jaf x’qed jiġri.
Just a lot of things like that.	Biss ħafna affarijiet bħal dawn.
It will not be the first time.	Ma tkunx l-ewwel darba.
She would be eating now.	Kieku kienet tiekol issa.
I don't want a man.	Ma rridx raġel.
I was never going back there.	Qatt ma kont sejjer lura hemm.
I usually am.	Jien normalment jien.
I'm afraid he doesn't always tell the truth	Nibża li mhux dejjem jgħid il-verità
I have.	Għandi.
I think he was thinking	Naħseb li kien qed jaħseb
I knew it was you.	Kont naf li kont int.
I shouldn't be here either	Lanqas għandi nkun qiegħed hawn
I couldn't believe it was you	Ma stajtx nemmen li kont int
You can't go wrong with this.	Ma tistax tmur ħażin b'dan.
It is working well.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb.
Like someone else's child.	Bħal tifel ta’ xi ħadd ieħor.
He could live forever.	Huwa seta 'jgħix għal kollox.
It will happen someday.	Se jiġri xi darba.
I would like to talk to you about what you know.	Nixtieq nitkellem miegħek dwar dak li taf.
He did the only thing he could.	Huwa għamel l-unika ħaġa li seta '.
This is my first time.	Din hija l-ewwel darba tiegħi.
I know better than to try so far	Għandi naf aħjar milli nipprova sa issa
I think a lot for you	Naħseb ħafna għalik
Harder to do.	Aktar diffiċli li tagħmel.
I thought about where she was going from here	Ħsibt fejn kienet tmur minn hawn
That’s what you’re after.	Dak hu li int wara.
There is no problem here.	M'hemm l-ebda problema hawn.
Which is not.	Li mhux.
No one knew where he lived.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn jgħix.
But it was better than not.	Imma kien aktar tajjeb milli le.
He will do nothing about it.	Mhu se jagħmel xejn dwar dan.
Maybe I’ll never do anything again	Forsi qatt ma nagħmel xejn mill-ġdid
You want to know.	Trid tkun taf.
Not everything is exactly as it should be.	Mhux kollox huwa eżatt kif għandu jkun.
It was always this or that.	Dejjem kien dan jew dak.
If not, go for something like this.	Jekk le, tmur xi ħaġa bħal din.
I wanted to take it with me	Ridt nieħu miegħi
I used to be a little boy	Jien kont inkun tifel żgħir
I was too young to understand	Kont żgħir wisq biex nifhem
I don't want to know.	Ma rridx inkun naf.
If you do nothing, nothing happens.	Jekk ma tagħmel xejn, ma jiġri xejn.
Not even a little	Lanqas ftit
Maybe he thought it was you.	Forsi ħaseb li kien int.
Who knows.	Li jaf.
Hard to say.	Diffiċli li tgħid.
Very good, very good.	Tajjeb ħafna, ħafna.
You never see anything.	Qatt ma tara xejn.
I know it must be hard	Naf li għandu jkun diffiċli
I think here the same.	Naħseb li hawn l-istess.
I’ve been able to do this myself.	Jien stajt nagħmel dan jien.
I wasn’t sure if it was going to go or not	Ma kontx ċert jekk hux se jmur jew le
For other work.	Għal xogħol ieħor.
I think he knows that too	Naħseb li jaf dan ukoll
This either.	Dan lanqas.
I can't do all this for you	Ma nistax nagħmel dan kollu għalik
Tired.	Għajjien.
We know where everyone is.	Nafu fejn qiegħed kulħadd.
He said.	Qal.
I have everything you need	Għandi dak kollu li għandek bżonn
Obviously, this was not his first time.	Ovvjament, din ma kinitx l-ewwel darba tiegħu.
Not for me, but.	Mhux għalija, imma.
And nothing too fast.	U xejn malajr wisq.
And something else.	U xi ħaġa oħra.
But he was not speaking.	Imma ma kienx jitkellem.
It’s everything and nothing.	Huwa kollox u xejn.
Maybe try something like that.	Forsi ipprova xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I’ll listen to it some other time, if you like.	Jien ser nisma 'xi żmien ieħor, jekk tixtieq.
That he did.	Li għamel.
I don’t say anything to anyone	Jien ma ngħid xejn lil ħadd
I didn’t know it was so bad	Ma kontx naf li kien daqshekk ħażin
I’m sure you don’t.	Jiena ċert li ma tagħmilx hekk.
You don't want that.	Inti ma tridx li.
I still had one last chance	Għadni kelli l-aħħar ċans
Nothing for you whatever.	Xejn għalik tkun xi tkun.
I need to know everything	Għandi bżonn inkun naf kollox
Nothing too bad.	Xejn ħażin wisq.
So did everyone.	Hekk għamel kulħadd.
I never went back home after that	Qatt ma mort lura d-dar wara dak
Everything was going properly.	Kollox kien qed jiġri kif suppost.
I was so ready for him to go home	Kont tant lest għalih imur id-dar
As I like to talk.	Kif inħobb nitkellem.
For many people, they are.	Għal ħafna nies, huma.
Afraid to happen.	Jibża 'jiġri.
I never thought about it !.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan!.
It had been a long time	Kien għadda żmien twil
My home is your home forever.	Id-dar tiegħi hija d-dar tiegħek għal dejjem.
I try to be a good boy.	Nipprova nkun tifel tajjeb.
So I thought at the time	Hekk ħsibt dak iż-żmien
You are ready.	Inti lest.
I had no problem with it	Ma kellix problema miegħu
I didn’t think I wanted more	Ma kontx naħseb li ridt aktar
I’ve never been able to do anything like that	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik
A man there told me.	Raġel li kien hemm qalli.
He knows his stuff.	Jaf l-affarijiet tiegħu.
I did the same	Jien għamilt l-istess
I couldn't say who	Ma stajtx ngħid ta’ min
I knew it would take a long time	Kont naf li kien se jieħu ħafna żmien
I needed to know this.	Kelli bżonn inkun naf dan.
It’s not too big or not too small.	Mhuwiex kbir wisq jew mhux żgħir wisq.
Much, much more.	Ħafna, ħafna aktar.
You can go home now.	Tista’ tmur id-dar issa.
He will speak the truth.	Se jitkellem il-verità.
I need a little more time	Għandi bżonn ftit aktar ħin
I saw it happen.	Rajt jiġri.
In fact, everything was fine.	Fil-fatt, kollox kien tajjeb.
I didn’t get a chance to do that	Ma kellix ċans nagħmel dan
He had to make sure no one was home.	Kellu jkun ċert li ħadd ma kien id-dar.
He is trying to speak.	Qed jipprova jitkellem.
It works now.	Jaħdem issa.
Arrive early.	Jasal kmieni.
I did what was easier	Għamilt dak li kien aktar faċli
I never heard anything	Qatt ma smajt xi ħaġa
Everyone was right.	Kulħadd kellu raġun.
I just want to say.	Nixtieq ngħid biss.
I was thinking.	Kont qed naħseb.
You can’t see what’s in the back.	Ma tistax tara x'hemm fuq wara.
I have to wonder if it passed.	Irrid nistaqsi jekk għadda.
I think she’s just tired.	Naħseb li hija biss għajjien.
I couldn’t wait to be alone.	Ma stajtx nistenna li nkun waħdi.
I know about these things	Naf dwar dawn l-affarijiet
She didn't know what was wrong.	Ma kinitx taf x’kien ħażin.
If you need to do this.	Jekk għandek bżonn tagħmel dan.
I just have to take whatever comes my way	Ikolli biss nieħu dak kollu li jiġi
This takes work.	Dan jieħu xogħol.
I was a pretty good teacher	Kont għalliem pjuttost tajjeb
I needed to know the truth	Kelli bżonn inkun naf il-verità
I thought he wanted to.	Ħsibt li hekk ried.
I never did that at home	Jien qatt ma kont nagħmel hekk id-dar
We did well.	Għamilna tajjeb.
I thought you might be interested!	Ħsibt li tista’ tkun interessat!
I was worried about it	Kont inkwetat dwarha
I did that too but I can’t anymore	Jien għamilt hekk ukoll imma ma nistax aktar
It was you, see.	Kont int, tara.
He thought that was what she needed.	Huwa ħaseb li huwa dak li kellha bżonn.
I never needed to know anything else	Qatt ma kelli bżonn inkun naf xi ħaġa oħra
I can only hear you now	Nista 'biss nisma' inti issa
I thought it was you	Ħsibt li kienet int
It didn’t look like anyone knew either way.	Ma kienx qisu xi ħadd ikun jaf jew mod.
I just had a great time	Għadni kemm kelli żmien tajjeb ħafna
I'll tell you things	Jien ngħidlek affarijiet
Why are you so good.	Għaliex int daqshekk tajjeb.
It was said.	Kien qal.
I am never tired of doing that	Qatt ma għajjien nagħmel hekk
I want to know how it was	Irrid inkun naf kif kienet
I wasn’t going to buy these there.	Jien ma kontx se nixtri dawn hemmhekk.
I was not understanding anything	Jien kont qed nifhem xejn
I didn’t think I wanted to.	Ma kontx naħseb li ridt hekk.
You are nothing.	Inti xejn.
I know you want to be great	Naf li trid tkun waħda kbira
There was no work for him.	Ma kienx hemm xogħol għalih.
You always want more.	Dejjem trid aktar.
It may or may not do so.	Jista’ jagħmel hekk jew le.
How much, he can't say.	Kemm, ma jistax jgħid.
I was too young to understand.	Kont żgħir wisq biex nifhem.
It is coming so fast.	Huwa ġej daqshekk malajr.
I didn’t have long to wait	Ma kellix twil nistenna
I haven’t had anything like this in years	Ilni snin ma kelli xejn bħal dan
I can't do anything today	Illum ma nistax nagħmel xejn
I had to be here	I kellha tkun hawn
He has to.	Huwa għandu.
I'm afraid he'll try something	Nibża li se jipprova xi ħaġa
I couldn’t say before	Ma stajtx ngħid qabel
This makes things better.	Dan jagħmel l-affarijiet aħjar.
I want to hear about it	Irrid nisma dwar dan
Now it has arrived.	Issa wasal.
I wasn't sure.	Ma kontx ċert.
But that could be just me.	Imma dak jista 'jkun biss jien.
I didn't want that to happen	Ma ridtx li jiġri hekk
I heard what’s on yours.	Smajt x'hemm fuq tiegħek.
Nothing will do.	Xejn se tagħmel.
I want something more	Irrid xi ħaġa aktar
I was thinking.	Jien kont qed naħseb.
It's a good job.	Huwa xogħol tajjeb.
He seemed to be doing the job.	Deher li jagħmel ix-xogħol.
I didn't know it was possible	Ma kontx naf li jista’ jkun
It wasn’t the first time either.	Ma kinitx l-ewwel darba lanqas.
It really was.	Kien tassew.
Well here you go.	Ukoll hawn tmur.
I said so.	Jien għidt hekk.
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi le.
He does whatever he wants.	Jagħmel dak kollu li jrid.
I didn’t want to talk about it with him	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwar dan miegħu
Tonight I was doing so much	Illejla kont qed nagħmel hekk ħafna
This was easier.	Dan kien aktar faċli.
This is being.	Dan qed ikun.
But that was not good for him.	Imma dan ma kienx tajjeb miegħu.
Much more money.	Ħafna aktar flus.
And probably sooner rather than later.	U probabbilment aktar kmieni milli wara.
Everyone has.	Kulħadd għandu.
Now, it's ready.	Issa, huwa lest.
I want to know how she is	Irrid inkun naf kif hi
You will, you will.	Inti se, inti se.
But it may not be right for you.	Imma jista 'ma jkunx tajjeb għalik.
He really was tired.	Huwa tassew kien għajjien.
All too often.	Kollha wisq drabi.
It was a little too much.	Kienet ftit wisq.
Come home for a while.	Ejja d-dar għal ftit ħin.
I can't tell you anything	Ma nista’ ngħidlek xejn
This would be harder to do.	Dan ikun aktar diffiċli biex tagħmel.
We both know what we're going to do.	It-tnejn nafu x’se nagħmlu.
It's not just you.	Mhux int biss.
Not for everyone.	Mhux għal kulħadd.
I need my money.	Għandi bżonn flus tiegħi.
I think you will like this	Naħseb li inti ser bħal din
I knew he was going to do everything he could.	Kont naf li kien se jagħmel dak kollu li jista’.
I never told anyone	Qatt ma għedt lil ħadd
It's not that easy.	Mhuwiex daqshekk faċli.
Who is with me?	Min hu miegħi?.
I heard what happened today	Smajt x’ġara llum
I didn’t even know, how it happened.	Lanqas ma kont naf, kif ġara.
I didn’t believe it was	Ma kontx nemmen li kien
This job I didn’t want anymore	Dan ix-xogħol ma ridtx aktar
Now it’s time for you to be the same with me.	Issa wasal iż-żmien li inti tkun l-istess miegħi.
It was good.	Kienet tajjeb.
They felt small.	Ħassu żgħir.
It is being done.	Qed isir.
I was wondering why it wasn’t there	Kont qed nistaqsi għaliex ma kienx hemm
I was right every time	Kelli raġun kull darba
I can tell you the truth.	Nista’ ngħidlek il-verità.
It seems good to me.	Jidher li huwa tajjeb għalija.
I can’t believe you did that, for me	Ma nistax nemmen li għamilt hekk, għalija
I was just surprised	Kont biss sorpriż
I still can't believe it	Għadni ma nistax nemmen li
But for how long ?.	Imma għal kemm żmien?.
I'm staying there now.	Jien noqgħod hemm issa.
I can't believe it.	Ma nistax nemmen.
Little did he know.	Ftit kien jaf.
Many hours.	Ħafna sigħat.
It’s not as easy as that.	Mhuwiex faċli daqs dik.
That he knew.	Dan kien jaf.
For me it always happens that way.	Għalija dejjem jiġri hekk.
I wasn’t the same, neither was she	Jien ma kontx l-istess, lanqas hi
It happened before.	Ġara qabel.
It was good.	Kienet tajjeb.
Little by little he came around.	Ftit ftit daħal madwar.
All she ever needed.	Kollha li qatt kellha bżonn.
I just had to stay home	I kellha biss noqgħod id-dar
That was me every year.	Dak kont jien kull sena.
I was thinking about my work	Kont qed naħseb dwar ix-xogħol tiegħi
It can't be done.	Ma jistax isir.
No one really comes here anymore.	Ħadd ma jiġi verament hawn aktar.
I will wait outside until it is ready	Jien se nistenna barra sakemm tkun lest
Anyone who wants to talk can talk.	Kull min irid jitkellem jista’ jitkellem.
I wonder where we can go	Nistaqsi fejn nistgħu mmorru
This for me, is not a job.	Dan għalija, mhuwiex xogħol.
Maybe there was another way.	Forsi kien hemm mod ieħor.
I need to tell someone about this	Għandi bżonn ngħid lil xi ħadd dwar dan
I knew it was really	Kont naf li kien verament
I want to know how well I'm doing	Irrid inkun naf kemm sejjer tajjeb
I wanted someone else to talk.	Ridt li xi ħadd ieħor jitkellem.
None of this was supposed to happen.	Xejn minn dan ma kellu jiġri.
And maybe yours too.	U forsi tiegħek jista’ jkun ukoll.
It was too early for me.	Kien kmieni wisq għalija.
I know it will go wrong	Naf li se tmur ħażin
I couldn't say anything	Ma stajt ngħid xejn
This has happened often.	Dan ġara spiss.
You’ll know if it was.	Int tkun taf jekk kinitx.
I wasn’t sure about anything	Ma kont ċert dwar xejn
I’m not going to settle for that.	Jien mhux se noqgħod għal dan.
He came to my house before he went to stay here.	Wasal id-dar tiegħi qabel ma mar joqgħod hawn.
She was great, actually.	Hija kienet kbira, fil-fatt.
He is a good man.	Huwa raġel tajjeb.
I think there is more	Naħseb li hemm aktar
But not now.	Imma mhux issa.
I won’t expect anything more	Mhux se nistenna xejn aktar
I can do that.	Nista’ nagħmel dan.
First, it’s because it actually happened.	L-ewwel, huwa għaliex fil-fatt ġara.
Something better than nothing.	Xi ħaġa aħjar minn xejn.
I shouldn't be able to say that for sure	M'għandix inkun nista' ngħid dan għal ċert
He is planning something.	Qed jippjana xi ħaġa.
But what happened now is nothing.	Imma dak li ġara issa mhu xejn.
And it does so quickly.	U dan jagħmel malajr.
I really wanted to do that	Jien ridt ħafna nagħmel hekk
Maybe he was just having fun.	Forsi kien qed jieħu gost biss.
I can't do it anymore.	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
I saw what was there.	Rajt x’kien hemm.
I have never been so happy.	Qatt ma kont daqshekk kuntent.
I had to eat outside	Kelli niekol barra
But she knew this would not happen.	Imma kienet taf li dan mhux se jiġri.
I have no problems.	M'għandi l-ebda problemi.
I didn’t think it was going to happen that fast	Ma kontx naħseb li kien se jiġri daqshekk malajr
But very little.	Imma ftit ħafna.
I can't and neither can you	Jien ma nistax u lanqas int
He knew very well what to do, how much to do.	Kien jaf tajjeb ħafna x’għandu jagħmel, kemm kellu jagħmel.
It wasn’t the last time.	Ma kinitx l-aħħar darba.
He said so.	Huwa qal hekk.
And you’re not here now.	U int ma tkunx hawn issa.
There wasn’t much to see.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna x'tara.
Just not by me.	Biss mhux minni.
Anyone got an idea.	Kull min ħa xi idea.
I was good on my own	Jien kont tajjeb waħdi
I’m better than good actually.	Jien aħjar milli tajjeb fil-fatt.
I understand if.	Nifhem jekk.
Probably still there.	Probabbilment għadha hemm.
He had no time for anything like that.	Ma kellu l-ebda ħin għal xi ħaġa minn hekk.
In fact, I believe it could be the truth	Fil-fatt nemmen li tista’ tkun il-verità
I can't eat.	Ma nistax niekol.
Not sure what's going on here.	Mhux ċert x'qed jiġri hawn.
Nothing can happen.	Xejn ma jista 'jiġri.
That was often.	Li kien spiss.
I tell you all the time	Ngħidlek il-ħin kollu
I can tell you one thing	Nista’ ngħidlek ħaġa waħda
I couldn’t do this at home	Jien ma stajtx nagħmel dan id-dar
Ridt.	Ridt.
But he.	Imma hu.
You can do this for me.	Tista 'tagħmel dan għalija.
But, but.	Imma, imma.
I just wanted friends	Ridt biss ħbieb
He could see why.	Huwa seta 'jara għaliex.
I wasn’t for that.	Jien ma kontx għal dan.
And nothing more.	U xejn aktar.
Everything will be.	Kollox se jkun.
I already knew this was going to happen	Diġà kont naf li dan kien se jiġri
He had done well.	Huwa kien għamel tajjeb.
I knew it was a good idea	Kont naf li kienet idea tajba
But really, really good to be here.	Imma tassew, tassew tajjeb li tkun hawn.
I didn’t want my house	Ma ridtx id-dar tiegħi
They are just like each other.	Huma eżatt bħal xulxin.
Now she knew.	Issa kienet taf.
Maybe he can.	Forsi jista’.
I need time to think.	Għandi bżonn ħin biex naħseb.
I am afraid of what will happen	Nibża għal dak li se jiġri
He knew exactly how to play this.	Kien jaf eżatt kif jilgħab dan.
Too much work this week.	Wisq xogħol din il-ġimgħa.
Neither are you.	Lanqas int.
I just can't take it anymore	I biss ma nistax aktar
I'm ready here.	Jien lest hawn.
I thought.	Ħsibt.
There was just something.	Kien hemm biss xi ħaġa.
I want you to do something for me	Irrid li tagħmel xi ħaġa għalija
I knew this was what he wanted	Jien kont naf li dan hu li ried
It's better now.	Huwa aħjar issa.
But that should be for everyone.	Imma li għandu jkun għal kulħadd.
I was going to wonder how you know that	Kont se nistaqsi kif taf dan
I don't have time to do it again	M'għandix ħin biex nerġa' nagħmel dan
The same thing happened.	L-istess ħaġa ġara.
Today, he didn’t have to.	Illum, ma kellux.
I know nothing about it.	Ma naf xejn dwarha.
But it never does.	Imma dan qatt ma jagħmel.
And it was hard.	U kien diffiċli.
He knew exactly what he was doing to me.	Kien jaf eżatt x’kien qed jagħmel miegħi.
But that’s not what he wanted now.	Imma dan mhux dak li ried issa.
Just one more thing.	Ħaġa waħda oħra biss.
I can do it myself	Jien nista' nagħmel dan jien
It's easy to see why.	Huwa faċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
Not all together.	Mhux kollha flimkien.
There were many.	Kien hemm ħafna.
I had to tell someone	Kelli ngħid lil xi ħadd
But she is not.	Imma hi mhix.
It’s about how this work is done.	Huwa dwar kif dan ix-xogħol isir.
I can't regret coming here	Ma nistax jiddispjaċini li ġejt hawn
And this one.	U dan wieħed.
I didn’t want to, not really	Jien ma ridtx, mhux verament
I was very surprised	Kont sorpriż ħafna
That’s pretty much the same thing.	Dik hija pjuttost l-istess ħaġa.
I don’t know how to do that.	Ma nafx kif nagħmel dan.
I believe that’s what actually happened	Nemmen li dak li fil-fatt ġara
Everything was done well.	Kollox sar tajjeb.
This is not what he should do.	Dan mhuwiex dak li għandu jagħmel.
I knew it was going to be something like that	Kont naf li kellha tkun xi ħaġa bħal dik
I think maybe he knows where he’s going	Naħseb li forsi jaf fejn sejjer
I love what you do	Inħobb dak li tagħmel
And so it does.	U hekk tagħmel.
It’s what he is.	Huwa dak li hu hu.
I do what you do.	Jien nagħmel dak li tagħmel int.
It’s time to go home.	Wasal iż-żmien li tmur id-dar.
It was, too.	Kienet, ukoll.
I was glad to see that	Kont kuntent li nara dan
I can’t say enough about this book.	Ma nistax ngħid biżżejjed dwar dan il-ktieb.
I thought it was so	Ħsibt li kien hekk
I think I can do your job	Naħseb li nista' nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħek
There can never be enough of this.	Qatt ma jista’ jkun hemm biżżejjed minn dan.
I had a little.	Kelli ftit.
I don’t know when mine started	Ma nafx meta beda tiegħi
I can do more if you want	Nista' nagħmel aktar jekk trid
I just want to know who he was	Irrid inkun naf biss min kien
I never thought it was going wrong	Qatt ma ħsibt li sejjer ħażin
And that’s when it happened.	U dak huwa meta ġara.
It wasn't good.	Ma kienx tajjeb.
I want to go home.	Irrid immur id-dar.
Just wanted to please	Ridt biss jekk jogħġbok
It's good.	Huwa tajjeb.
I couldn’t see things as they really were	Ma stajtx nara l-affarijiet kif kienu verament
I didn’t regret it	Ma kontx jiddispjaċini dwar dan
I didn’t expect to be so happy	Ma kontx nistenna li nkun daqshekk ferħan
I know how bad school can be.	Naf kemm tista’ tkun ħażina l-iskola.
I also know how sure you are	Naf ukoll kemm int ċert
It’s always what you want.	Dejjem huwa dak li trid.
Now we can, of course.	Issa nistgħu, ovvjament.
He never worried about much of anything.	Hu qatt ma inkwetat dwar ħafna minn xejn.
Let me tell you something, boy.	Ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa, tifel.
I think it will be good	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb
I know I was doing what I could	Naf li kont tagħmel dak li stajt
Not before that afternoon.	Mhux qabel dik wara nofsinhar.
I knew there would be enough soon	Kont naf li dalwaqt se jkun hemm biżżejjed
It was very big.	Kien kbir ħafna.
I really need to go.	Verament għandi bżonn li mmur.
I thought it would be here by now	Ħsibt li se tkun hawn sa issa
I doubt he will appear again	Niddubita li jerġa' jidher
She didn't.	Hija ma.
I make this house for nothing	Jien nagħmel dan id-dar għal xejn
I can't understand anyone like that	Ma nistax nifhem lil xi ħadd hekk
I hope this works.	Nittama li dan jaħdem.
I have to say something.	Ikolli ngħid xi ħaġa.
Not worth eating.	Mhux ta’ min tiekol.
He can't go back now.	Ma jistax lura issa.
We do what we have to.	Aħna nagħmlu dak li għandna.
I only have time to say this once	Għandi ħin biss ngħid dan darba
You are just a child.	Inti biss tifel.
And anything can happen.	U kollox jista 'jiġri.
She didn't know what it was, but she did it.	Ma kinitx taf x’kien, imma kienet tagħmel dan.
First I have to say that it was not easy	L-ewwel irrid ngħid li ma kinitx faċli
But you are right.	Imma għandek raġun.
I was just surprised	Kont biss sorpriż
Like now.	Bħal issa.
I can't wait.	Ma nistax nistenna.
I know who they are all	Naf min huma kollha
I couldn't eat anymore	Ma stajtx niekol aktar
It is one and only.	Huwa wieħed u biss.
But you are not the same.	Imma m'intix l-istess.
It would be very difficult.	Ikun diffiċli ħafna.
I couldn't talk to him	Ma stajtx nitkellem miegħu
You can stay.	Tista' toqgħod.
This was not over.	Dan ma kienx fuq.
It was about a lot.	Kien madwar ħafna.
This is how they do things.	Dan huwa kif jagħmlu l-affarijiet.
I’m worried he didn’t want one with me	Jien inkwetat li ma riedx wieħed miegħi
I can say that something was wrong.	Nista 'ngħid li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
She will speak.	Hi se titkellem.
I went with a little friend.	Mort ma’ ħabib żgħir.
It will not return to its former state.	Mhux se jerġa’ lura għal dak li kien qabel.
He didn’t know how much.	Ma kienx jaf kemm.
There seemed to be no way.	Deher li ma kien hemm l-ebda mod.
I'll just see.	Jien ser nara biss.
Or so he thought.	Jew hekk ħaseb.
I think you already know the truth about it	Naħseb li diġà taf il-verità dwarha
I’m already talking to myself.	Diġà qed nitkellem miegħi.
But no one did.	Imma ħadd ma għamel.
I wasn’t sure if that was enough	Ma kontx ċert jekk kienx biżżejjed
Surely you are right.	Żgur li għandek raġun.
He is doing very well.	Huwa sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
And now not only.	U issa mhux biss.
I was hoping it would be later, much, much later	Kont nittama li jkun aktar tard, ħafna, ħafna aktar tard
It would be easy enough.	Ikun faċli biżżejjed.
He still didn't look like a bad man to me.	Għadu ma deherx qisu raġel ħażin għalija.
But as it was.	Imma kif kien.
But look back.	Imma ħares lura.
I know you like that	Naf li inti bħal dik
I want to be happy for you	Irrid inkun kuntent għalik
He never did anything alone.	Hu qatt ma għamel xejn waħdu.
I do whatever you want.	Jien nagħmel dak kollu li trid.
I have to try to make a friend too	Ikolli nipprova nagħmel ħabib ukoll
I haven’t been here many years	Ilni ma kontx hawn ħafna snin
I couldn’t say anything.	Ma stajt ngħid xejn.
I will never be afraid again	Qatt ma nerġa’ nibża’
I wasn't going to be okay	Ma kontx se nkun tajjeb
I just want to be happy for a while.	Irrid inkun kuntent biss għal xi żmien.
I want to talk about a few of these	Irrid nitkellem dwar ftit minn dawn
I thought that was just it	Ħsibt li kien biss hekk
I can tell you this is definitely not my thing.	Nista 'ngħidlek li din żgur mhix ħaġa tiegħi.
Everything is about time.	Kollox huwa dwar iż-żmien.
Not that there will be one.	Mhux li se jkun hemm waħda.
I know where I bought the last one	Naf minn fejn xtara l-aħħar
We never were.	Qatt ma konna.
No, he couldn't think of it.	Le, ma setax jaħseb dwarha.
I do that all the time	Jien nagħmel hekk il-ħin kollu
But you’re one too.	Imma int wieħed ukoll.
I do things, you do things	Jien nagħmel affarijiet, int tagħmel affarijiet
He could have done it.	Huwa seta 'għamel.
For some people, it's not great.	Għal xi nies, mhuwiex kbir.
There should be more people here.	Għandu jkun hemm aktar nies hawn.
We need something better.	Għandna bżonn xi ħaġa aħjar.
I will do this here	Jien se nagħmel dan hawn
But it was good for me.	Imma kien tajjeb għalija.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
I did, of course.	Jien għamilt, ovvjament.
I’m fine, really.	Jien tajjeb, tassew.
And he's not talking.	U mhux qed jitkellem.
This was happening.	Dan kien qed jiġri.
I needed to do something	Kelli bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa
I just wanted to be home	Ridt biss inkun id-dar
I couldn't see anything	Ma stajt nara xejn
But he was just like a man.	Imma kien biss qisu raġel.
I wanted to try it myself	Ridt nipprova jien
You are not going there.	M'intix sejjer hemm.
Better than many, in fact.	Aħjar minn ħafna, fil-fatt.
You can't even think about it really.	Inti lanqas biss tista 'taħseb dwar dan verament.
They are one.	Huma wieħed.
This was done.	Dan sar.
He was happy.	Kien kuntent.
I never had to say	Qatt ma kelli ngħid
But that works.	Imma dak ix-xogħol.
There was nothing to see.	Ma kien hemm xejn x’tara.
I try to do that too	Nipprova nagħmel dan ukoll
But it will be easier.	Imma se jkun aktar faċli.
The time is coming.	Il-ħin ġej.
And there is a lot of time.	U hemm ħafna ħin.
You are alone above.	Inti waħdek hawn fuq.
I am supposed to know better than I do this	I suppost naf aħjar milli nagħmel dan
I only had one, and I really wanted another	Kelli wieħed biss, u verament ridt ieħor
And another thing.	U ħaġa oħra.
Every once in a while.	Kull darba waħda.
And of course a lot can happen on this.	U ovvjament ħafna jista 'jiġri fuq dan.
I need to go now.	Għandi bżonn immur issa.
But no more about that.	Imma mhux aktar dwar dan.
I knew why.	Kont naf għaliex.
I actually don't.	Jien fil-fatt ma.
I don’t even think so.	Lanqas naħseb.
This is great.	Dan huwa kbir.
I went to his room.	Mort fil-kamra tiegħu.
I never thought so	Qatt ma ħsibt hekk
I almost did these things	Kważi għamilt dawn l-affarijiet
I know exactly what you are saying	Naf eżatt x'qed tgħid
So it was with just about anything else.	Hekk kien biss dwar kull ħaġa oħra.
He said no more.	Huwa qal mhux aktar.
You can never be sure.	Qatt ma tista’ tkun ċert.
I think it’s one thing	Naħseb li hija ħaġa waħda
And no one sees it.	U ħadd ma jara dan.
I didn’t need to know more than that	Ma kellix bżonn inkun naf aktar minn hekk
I couldn’t do any wrong.	Ma stajt nagħmel l-ebda ħażin.
I really didn't want to	Verament ma ridtx
I didn’t want to think about it all	Ma ridtx naħseb dwar dan kollu
We are yours, and yours alone.	Aħna tiegħek, u tiegħek biss.
I like to watch you eat	Inħobb nara li tiekol
I am trying my best to tell you the truth	Qed nipprova minn kollox biex ngħidlek il-verità
I really don’t know anything about anything.	Verament ma naf xejn dwar xi ħaġa.
Well, he had done this often enough before.	Ukoll, kien għamel dan spiss biżżejjed qabel.
He seemed happy.	Huwa deher kuntent.
I see nothing wrong.	Ma nara xejn ħażin.
And that's good.	U dan huwa tajjeb.
Not just when I was young.	Mhux biss meta kont żgħir.
I couldn’t even think of doing so.	Lanqas stajt naħseb biex nagħmel hekk.
I think this will work.	Naħseb li dan se jaħdem.
She was not.	Hija ma kinitx.
Or no one is.	Jew ħadd ma hu.
Or a man.	Jew raġel.
I may never be able to do that	Jien forsi qatt ma nkun kapaċi nagħmel dan
You have to go.	Trid tmur.
I never had to do that	Qatt ma kelli nagħmel dan
This will do today.	Dan se jagħmel illum.
I had no idea what would happen next.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'se jiġri wara.
I think nothing like that	Naħseb li xejn bħal dan
And more fun.	U aktar gost.
Easier for everyone so.	Aktar faċli għal kulħadd hekk.
I was worried too, but not so much about it.	Jien kont inkwetat ukoll, imma mhux daqshekk dwar dan.
I might be fine with that.	I jista 'jkun tajjeb ma' dak.
One thing at a time, she says.	Ħaġa waħda kull darba, tgħid.
And there is an account.	U hemm kont.
You can see right there.	Tista 'tara eżatt hemm.
That wasn’t the problem.	Dik ma kinitx il-problema.
It comes too late.	Jiġi tard wisq.
And maybe before long, we will.	U forsi qabel twil, aħna se.
I know he’s still working to take everything	Naf li għadu qed jaħdem biex jieħu kollox
No, he is right.	Le, huwa raġun.
It would be very difficult.	Ikun diffiċli ħafna.
Morning and evening.	Filgħodu u filgħaxija.
Never talk about it.	Qatt ma titkellem dwarha.
You're a good boy.	Int tifel tajjeb.
I want to go outside	Irrid immur barra
Nothing worth buying.	Xejn ta 'min jixtri.
I was worried she wasn’t	Kont inkwetat li ma kinitx
No one can do that.	Ħadd ma jista 'jagħmel dan.
I can do things.	Kapaċi nagħmel affarijiet.
I'm not one.	Jien mhux wieħed.
I knew he would never be able to buy one.	Kont naf li qatt ma kien se jkun jista’ jixtri wieħed.
I doubt you need to do anything.	Niddubita li għandek bżonn tagħmel xi ħaġa.
And not just now.	U mhux issa biss.
I know what's going on	Naf x'qed jiġri
It’s so easy and great.	Huwa daqshekk faċli u kbir.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
I couldn’t even wait	Jien lanqas stajt nistenna
You are not good to us if you are not good.	M'intix tajjeb għalina jekk m'intix tajjeb.
I hope once is enough	Nispera li darba tkun biżżejjed
I understand a little more now	Nifhem ftit aktar issa
It certainly doesn't.	Huwa żgur li ma.
I love everything about it.	Jien inħobb kollox dwarha.
There is no other way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor.
Just to be sure.	Biss biex tkun ċert.
I had thought about this before	I kellha ħsibt dwar dan qabel
I haven’t even heard everything	Lanqas smajt kollox
They are just people.	Huma biss nies.
He did a lot for me.	Għamel ħafna għalija.
Maybe there was someone.	Forsi kien hemm xi ħadd.
This will be you.	Dan se tkun int.
But he wasn't sure.	Imma ma kienx ċert.
But it has been so long.	Imma ilu tant.
It's too much.	Huwa wisq.
I knew it was for me	Kont naf li kien għalija
I would say so for him.	Jien ngħid hekk għalih.
There is a man here for you.	Hemm raġel hawn għalik.
I love it that way.	Inħobb hekk.
I need to know where you are all the time	Għandi bżonn inkun naf fejn int il-ħin kollu
It wasn’t the same yet, he knew.	Ma kienx għadu l-istess, kien jaf.
I would love to hear more	Nixtieq nisma aktar
That was a problem for us.	Li kienet problema għalina.
You must come with me, now, to my room.	Għandek tiġi miegħi, issa, fil-kamra tiegħi.
Not bad really.	Mhux ħażin tassew.
He went too far.	Huwa mar wisq.
That's what they do.	Huwa dak li jagħmlu.
He doesn't know.	Ma jafx.
He obviously could never do that	Huwa ovvjament qatt ma jista 'jagħmel dan
I wasn’t young yet.	Ma kontx għadni żgħir.
I can't hear you anymore	Ma nistax nisma aktar
I had to be here before I was	I kellha tkun hawn qabel ma kien
I had no idea it was so good	Ma kellix idea li kien daqshekk tajjeb
I couldn't do anything else	Ma stajt nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra
You can go soon if you want.	Tista' tmur dalwaqt jekk trid.
I have never been back before.	Qatt ma kont lura qabel.
And about how glad he was to be here.	U dwar kemm kien ferħan li kien hawn.
You take nothing more from me.	Inti ma tieħu xejn aktar minni.
I would like to try that as well	Nixtieq nipprova dik ukoll
That’s not just here.	Dak mhux hawn biss.
But no one asked.	Imma ħadd ma talab.
I can do it myself	Jien nista' nagħmel dan jien
More is better.	Aktar huwa aħjar.
No one really knows.	Ħadd ma jaf verament.
I will do that again.	Se nerġa' nagħmel dan.
It was always the same.	Dejjem kien l-istess.
That pretty well should be worth seeing.	Li pjuttost tajjeb għandu jkun ta 'min jara.
She needed to see.	Hija kellha bżonn tara.
I knew it was very bad	Kont naf li kien ħażin ħafna
I did nothing wrong.	Ma għamilt xejn ħażin.
I really want one of these	Irrid tassew waħda minn dawn
All our work.	Ix-xogħol tagħna kollu.
I know you talk to him	Naf li titkellem miegħu
And he was right.	U kellu raġun.
He wanted to.	Ried.
You're talking to me.	Qed titkellem miegħi.
As everyone knows, this has been done very, very well.	Kif jaf kulħadd, dan sar tajjeb ħafna, ħafna.
I don’t want to wait any longer.	Ma rridx nistenna aktar.
I wasn’t always like that	Jien mhux dejjem kont hekk
That was never the case for me.	Li qatt ma kien għalija.
I will not be afraid.	Jien mhux se nibża.
I'll be at work tomorrow.	Jien ser inkun fuq ix-xogħol għada.
I didn’t think it would be so.	Ma kontx naħseb li se jkun hekk.
There was almost no one.	Kien hemm kważi ħadd.
He wanted to know if he could help.	Ried ikun jaf jekk jistax jgħin.
It takes a lot.	Huwa jieħu ħafna.
He felt bad.	Huwa ħassu ħażin.
I hope this is good with you.	Nispera li dan huwa tajjeb miegħek.
I know this is the last time	Naf li din hija l-aħħar darba
I know you're always there for me	Naf li int dejjem hemm għalija
I wonder if there is anyone	Nistaqsi jekk hux hemm xi ħadd
I don’t want to be there	Ma rridx hemmhekk
Nothing ever happens as planned.	Xejn qatt ma jiġri kif tippjana.
I was more than happy to do so	Kont aktar minn ferħan li nagħmel hekk
There is no way to know.	M'hemm l-ebda mod biex tkun taf.
I had a friend who was a man	Kelli ħabib li kien raġel
I will have to go back.	Ikolli mmur lura.
For me.	Għalija.
Everyone was having fun.	Kulħadd kien qed jieħu gost.
Nothing was right.	Xejn ma kien tajjeb.
I had time to think tonight.	Kelli ħin naħseb illejla.
That’s not so bad.	Dak mhux daqshekk ħażin.
I expect that to happen	Nistenna li jiġri hekk
I didn’t know much more than that	Ma kontx naf wisq aktar minn hekk
You never knew who might be watching.	Qatt ma kont taf min jista’ jkun qed jara.
You have no problem with that.	M'għandekx problema b'dan.
I can’t be sure.	Ma nistax inkun ċert.
I hope they were all	Jien nittama li kienu kollha
So it must be.	Hekk għandu jkun.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
I can't eat anything	Ma nista’ niekol xejn
I was doing work.	Kont xogħol li qed isir.
I will say this only once more	Jien se ngħid dan għal darba oħra biss
I never told anyone.	Qatt ma għedt lil ħadd.
Arrive in the evening.	Jasal filgħaxija.
It seemed a bit early for that.	Deher daqsxejn kmieni għal dan.
You can do better and you should.	Tista 'tagħmel aħjar u għandek.
I want to do something for you	Irrid nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik
And you are going to get what you want.	U int se tmur tieħu dak li trid.
Who is it.	Min hu.
No, okay.	Le, tajjeb.
You should have seen the following.	Kellek tara li ġej.
But she will.	Imma hi se.
The problem is that it is taking too long.	Il-problema hi li qed tieħu wisq żmien.
I shouldn't be here with you like that	M'għandix inkun hawn miegħek hekk
I'm just me ?.	Jien biss jien?.
He was not.	Hu ma kienx.
I knew it would be wrong	Kont naf li jkun ħażin
What is not certain.	X'inhu mhux ċert.
I want a car.	Irrid karozza.
It takes many hours.	Huwa jieħu ħafna sigħat.
No one else saw it.	Ħadd ieħor ma ra.
I had no idea this was going to happen	Ma kelli l-ebda idea li dan kien se jiġri
he asked.	staqsa.
I want to hear other people do things	Irrid nisma nies oħra jagħmlu l-affarijiet
I’m glad it was the last one.	Jien kuntent li kien l-aħħar.
That, he said.	Dan, qal.
Well, he doesn't just know what he wants.	Ukoll, hu ma jafx biss dak li jrid.
I wonder where it came from	Nistaqsi minn fejn ġie
Maybe not that much.	Forsi mhux dak ħafna.
I knew that first	Jien kont naf li l-ewwel
Too little time.	Ftit żmien wisq.
It could be anything.	Jista 'jkun xejn.
We had a problem.	Kellna problema.
I can't count on anything	Ma nista’ kont ta’ xejn
Very few have this.	Ftit ħafna għandhom dan.
I will definitely do this often.	Żgur li se nagħmel dan spiss.
I can't do that	Ma nistax għamilt dan
I was only back a few times	Kont lura biss ftit drabi
I believe they were quite in love with each other	Nemmen li kienu pjuttost iħobb lil xulxin
I know exactly where he was	Naf eżatt fejn kien
That’s a big problem.	Dik hija problema kbira.
I think no one wants to do anything wrong	Naħseb li ħadd ma jrid jagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina
I was worried that you were alone	Kont inkwetat li inti waħdek
I was ready to listen to everything he had to say	Kont lest nisma’ dak kollu li kellu xi jgħid
I didn't see anything	Jien ma rajt xejn
I can make you happy	Nista 'nagħmel inti kuntent
You want to do what you want.	Trid tagħmel dak li trid.
It's coming now	Huwa ġej issa
She didn’t know how she knew that.	Ma kinitx taf kif kienet taf dan.
It was who he was.	Kien min kien.
I did a few times	Għamilt xi ftit drabi
There was one thing to say.	Kien hemm ħaġa waħda xi tgħid.
No, not so much.	Le, mhux hekk.
That was a good thing for me.	Din kienet ħaġa tajba għalija.
Well, it's been a long time.	Ukoll, ilu żmien twil.
I want to know how she did it and why	Irrid inkun naf kif għamlet dan u għaliex
He knew he would.	Huwa kien jaf li kieku.
I'm not going.	Jien mhux sejjer.
There may be.	Jista 'jkun hemm.
I want to talk about something else	Irrid nitkellem dwar xi ħaġa oħra
Who knows how many people there are.	Min jaf kemm hemm nies.
I want to ask something else	Irrid nistaqsi ħaġa oħra
Such a man would not only take what he wanted	Raġel bħal dan ma kienx jieħu biss dak li jrid
Here they are again.	Hawn huma mill-ġdid.
This happened more and more.	Dan ġara aktar u aktar.
I can't think of anything to eat	Ma nistax naħseb biex niekol
I know he is doing something	Naf li qed jagħmel xi ħaġa
I haven't been in a long time	Ilni ma kontx
That works well.	Li jaħdem tajjeb.
I know pretty much who he was	Jien naf pjuttost min kien
He knew everyone.	Kien jaf lil kulħadd.
But she is beautiful.	Imma hi sabiħa.
But he knew it was time.	Imma kien jaf li kien wasal iż-żmien.
This is pretty good.	Dan huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
I couldn't go shopping	Ma stajtx immur nixtri
She was doing it.	Hija kienet tagħmel dan.
You won’t even know it’s there.	Lanqas se tkun taf li hemm.
He knew she was going to be there.	Kien jaf li kienet se tkun hemm.
I was quite surprised by this.	Kont pjuttost sorpriż b'dan.
And that’s what’s happening.	U dak hu li qed jiġri.
I'm not telling you yet	Għadni mhux qed ngħidlek
But it was so long ago.	Imma kien tant ilu.
I will never believe these things	Jien qatt mhu se nemmen dawn l-affarijiet
It's mine now.	Huwa tiegħi issa.
This just happened to us.	Dan biss ġara għalina.
I talk about it often	Nitkellem dwarha spiss
I’m not seeing how this is done.	Mhux qed nara kif dan isir.
We had had enough.	Kellna biżżejjed.
It’s too little and too late.	Huwa ftit wisq u wisq tard.
I think not	Naħseb li mhux hekk
You can see why.	Tista 'tara għaliex.
I didn't know what he was saying.	Ma tantx kont naf x’qed jgħid.
It would have been so easy.	Kieku kien daqshekk faċli.
He knew he had to tell the truth.	Kien jaf li kellu jgħid il-verità.
I want this.	Jien irrid din.
I think he knew that	Naħseb li kien jaf li
I never do that.	Jien qatt ma nagħmel hekk.
That he did.	Li għamel.
I didn’t know anything about it.	Jien ma kont naf xejn dwarha.
Nothing looked the same.	Xejn ma deher l-istess.
It doesn't look like anyone might be working.	Ma jidhirx li xi ħadd jista' jkun qed jaħdem.
I would be doing the same thing	Inkun qed nagħmel l-istess ħaġa
No one needs to know.	Ħadd ma għandu bżonn ikun jaf.
After all, nothing was certain.	Wara kollox, xejn ma kien ċert.
I didn’t have to be that way	Jien ma kellix inkun hekk
It takes forever.	Huwa jieħu għal dejjem.
And so much more.	U tant aktar.
I think he should know	Naħseb li għandu jkun jaf
It usually was.	Normalment kien.
We were back.	Konna lura.
I think he was telling the truth	Naħseb li kien qed jgħid il-verità
I didn’t need to see this now	Ma kellix bżonn nara dan issa
That does nothing.	Li ma jagħmel xejn.
But there was no need to think about it.	Imma ma kienx hemm bżonn taħseb dwar dan.
It will never happen again.	Qatt ma jerġa’ jiġri.
And that was good.	U dan kien tajjeb.
I thought it was great	Ħsibt li kien kbir
I know a lot of people like that	Naf ħafna nies bħal dawn
I can’t do this alone	Ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi
I'm fine with that, but you may not be	Jiena tajjeb ma 'dan, imma inti tista' ma tkunx
She was doing something.	Kienet tagħmel xi ħaġa.
Or maybe it was too much.	Jew forsi kien wisq.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
I'm pretty good.	Jien pjuttost tajjeb.
I am very happy to be here	Jien kuntent ħafna li nkun hawn
There you are alone.	Hemm int biss.
You'll be back for more !.	Inti ser tkun lura għal aktar!.
Not just for me, but for everyone.	Mhux għalija biss, imma għal kulħadd.
He was interested.	Kien interessat.
I could see where that was going.	Stajt nara fejn dak kien sejjer.
Maybe you won't.	Forsi inti mhux se.
He knew.	Kien jaf.
This is not a bad thing.	Din mhix ħaġa ħażina.
I'll tell you more about that later	I ser ngħidlek aktar dwar dan aktar tard
This can be seen as follows.	Wieħed jista 'jara dan kif ġej.
I can't talk about it at all	Ma nistax nitkellem dwarha xejn
Definitely there.	Żgur li hemm.
We didn’t know anyone like that.	Ma konna nafu lil ħadd hekk.
I couldn't believe it	Ma stajtx nemmen
He must do it.	Huwa għandu jagħmel dan.
I knew it wasn't so good for me	Kont naf li ma kienx daqshekk tajjeb għalija
I never thought I was	Qatt ma ħsibt li ġejt
I'm ready.	Jien lest.
I can’t tell you when it just started	Ma nistax ngħid meta beda eżatt
I'm ready when it's you	Jien lest meta tkun int
Until, until, until.	Sakemm, sakemm, sakemm.
It could be better.	Jista 'jkun aħjar.
What is.	X'inhu.
I can go and do and be.	Nista’ mmur u nagħmel u nkun.
I understand you needed time after what happened	Nifhem li kellek bżonn iż-żmien wara dak li ġara
We can do much, much better.	Nistgħu nagħmlu ħafna, ħafna aħjar.
I really didn’t know what to do	Verament ma kontx naf li nagħmel
Well, she did.	Ukoll, hija għamlet hekk.
I just want to be your friend	Irrid inkun ħabib tiegħek biss
It was coming for me.	Kien ġej għalija.
It's been years.	Ilu snin.
Your work is finished.	Ix-xogħol tiegħek lest.
It was worth a try.	Hija kienet ta 'min jipprova tajjeb.
He couldn't see anymore.	Ma setax jara aktar.
If he doesn’t, he won’t.	Jekk ma jagħmilx hekk, mhux se.
It took a little longer.	Huwa ħa ftit aktar.
I will.	Jien se.
I thought about where I should go	Ħsibt fejn għandi mmur
I want the truth.	Irrid il-verità.
I could hear everything in the room	Stajt nisma’ dak kollu li kien hemm fil-kamra
You are ready.	Inti lest.
I was very happy for him	Kont kuntent ħafna għalih
He does the work for you	Huwa jagħmel ix-xogħol għalik
That was his job.	Dak kien ix-xogħol tiegħu.
I needed the truth.	Jien kelli bżonn il-verità.
More time passed.	Għadda aktar ħin.
I hope we are friends	Nispera li nkunu ħbieb
There is a lot of work out there.	Hemm ħafna xogħol hemmhekk.
He does what he says he will do.	Jagħmel dak li jgħid li se jagħmel.
I couldn't believe it either	Lanqas jien ma stajt nemmen
I’m too tired to do that	Jien għajjien wisq biex nagħmel dan
It's going well.	Huwa sejjer tajjeb.
And that’s pretty much it.	U dan huwa pjuttost.
I will take that with me	Jien se nieħu dak miegħi
There must be.	Għandu jkun hemm.
But still not enough.	Imma għadu mhux biżżejjed.
That's exactly it.	Dak hu eżatt.
I’ve been worried there for a while	Jien kont inkwetat hemm għal xi żmien
This is what is happening now.	Dan huwa dak li jiġri issa.
No one was there anymore.	Ħadd ma kien hemm aktar.
I didn't want money.	Ma ridtx flus.
I probably shouldn't	I probabbilment m'għandekx
I wasn’t sure what time it was.	Ma kontx ċert x'kien il-ħin.
I wanted to see if I was doing well	Ridt nara jekk kontx sejjer tajjeb
That's me.	Dak hu jien.
If it comes back, it's yours.	Jekk jiġi lura, huwa tiegħek.
I couldn’t so much	Jien ma stajtx daqshekk
It seemed to be both.	Deher li kienet it-tnejn.
She knows you have to think.	Hija taf li trid taħseb.
I think it will be great	Naħseb li se tkun kbira
I was happy about it	Kont kuntent dwar dan
I want you to have a good time	Irrid li tieħu ħin tajjeb
There will be quite a few more soon.	Se jkun hemm pjuttost ftit aktar dalwaqt.
I thought for a while but I couldn't think of anything	Ħsibt għal ftit imma ma stajt naħseb xejn
I couldn't prove it	Ma stajtx nipprova dan
Too late, he was thinking.	Tard wisq, kien qed jaħseb.
It was a bad year.	Kienet sena ħażina.
Today, there is a problem.	Illum, hemm problema.
I will know where you are	Jien inkun naf fejn int
I might take this a little too far	I jista 'jieħu dan ftit wisq
I have been here so long.	Ilni hawn daqshekk.
I never knew anyone had done this until recently	Qatt ma kont naf li xi ħadd għamel dan sa ftit ilu
We only knew we had to do it.	Konna nafu biss li kellna nagħmlu dan.
I needed to be there wrong.	Kelli bżonn inkun hemm ħażin.
I knew something was going to happen	Kont naf li se jiġri xi ħaġa
And it's a great one.	U hija waħda kbira.
I definitely want to go back	Żgur li rrid immur lura
I think he’s still waiting	Naħseb li għadu qed jistenna
It is something more.	Hija xi ħaġa aktar.
I did this for about a year	Dan għamilt għal madwar sena
No, that's not a good one.	Le, dik mhix waħda tajba.
He never arrives again.	Hu qatt ma jasal aktar.
I was just wondering if	Kont biss nistaqsi jekk
I would like to know more.	Nixtieq inkun naf aktar.
I never thought about it	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan
We are nothing like this.	Aħna xejn bħal dan.
That's really hard.	Dak verament diffiċli.
And so was everyone in the room.	U hekk kien kulħadd fil-kamra.
It wasn’t ahead of time.	Ma kienx qabel iż-żmien.
I can’t do this alone.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi.
I thought it might be.	Ħsibt li tista’ tkun.
I'm worried about that	Jien inkwetat dwar dan
Everyone was glad he was leaving.	Kulħadd kien ferħan li se jitlaq.
Usually this was me.	Normalment dan kont jien.
I think he lost	Naħseb li tilef
I had never seen anything like that before.	Qatt ma kont rajt xi ħaġa bħal dik qabel.
I couldn't even hear what he was saying	Lanqas biss stajt nisma’ dak li qal
I don't even regret it	Lanqas ma jiddispjaċini
I had to do this years ago	I kellha tagħmel dan snin ilu
I was not in the room	Jien ma kontx fil-kamra
But he said nothing.	Imma ma qal xejn.
He knew better.	Kien jaf aħjar.
I was having fun, everything	Kont qed nieħu gost, kollox
Maybe a few times he said this first.	Forsi ftit drabi qal dan l-ewwel.
It was nothing.	Kien xejn.
I would not have been able to do this alone	Ma kontx inkun kapaċi nagħmel dan waħdi
Not for me.	Mhux għalija.
I thought you were here	Ħsibt li kont int hawn
It was great to see everyone play.	Kien kbir li nara lil kulħadd jilgħab.
I don’t have that problem.	M'għandix dik il-problema.
I wanted something to happen	Ridt li jiġri xi ħaġa
Must have.	Għandu jkollu.
I didn't say anything.	Jien ma għedt xejn.
But there is one thing we know for sure	Imma hemm ħaġa waħda li nafu żgur
I thought he was going too far	Ħsibt li kien sejjer wisq
But no, he was still there.	Imma le, kien għadu hemm.
I still can’t ask for that	Għadni ma nistax nistaqsi dwar dan
I thought how would you like to know.	Ħsibt kif tixtieq tkun taf.
I didn’t know she was going to do that	Ma kontx naf li kienet se tagħmel hekk
It would have been enough for most people.	Kien ikun biżżejjed għal ħafna nies.
Both only now.	It-tnejn biss issa.
Not much time but enough to do something.	Mhux ħafna ħin imma biżżejjed biex tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I still didn’t know if she was okay	Għadni ma kontx naf jekk kinitx tajjeb
I just need a little time to think	Għandi bżonn biss ftit ħin biex naħseb
You have until this time tomorrow.	Għandek sa dan iż-żmien għada.
I can’t wait to try	Ma nistax nistenna li nipprova
I don’t know if you can do that.	Ma nafx jekk tistax tagħmel dan.
But there is a problem there as well.	Imma hemm problema hemm ukoll.
I didn’t expect that	Ma kontx nistenna hekk
He says he wants to talk to you.	Jgħid li jrid jitkellem miegħek.
He just never did.	Hu biss qatt ma għamel.
Or to someone.	Jew lil xi ħadd.
I still haven’t done anything wrong.	Għadni ma għamilt xejn ħażin.
I'll tell you when	Jien ngħidlek meta
I had enough	Kelli biżżejjed
I can't see here	Ma nistax nara hawn
Maybe he's right.	Forsi għandu raġun.
I just wanted to know what happened	Kelli nkun naf x’ġara biss
You know this now.	Inti taf dan issa.
But it seems you are not for me.	Imma jidher li m'intix għalija.
I’m actually much better.	Jien fil-fatt ħafna aħjar.
Doing so is easy.	Li tagħmel dan huwa faċli.
I was surprised at how she looked	Kont sorpriż kif kienet tidher
I was there with you	Jien kont hemm miegħek
I don't really need to	M'għandix bżonn verament
What comes next, who knows.	Dak li ġej wara, min jaf.
I can’t think and I still have nothing	Ma nistax naħseb u għadni xejn
I did so.	Jien għamilt hekk.
I knew it had to happen	Kont naf li kellu jiġri
Nobody says anything.	Ħadd ma jgħid xejn.
It's really you.	Huwa tassew int.
It has to be.	Irid ikun.
I am very interested to know.	Jien interessat ħafna li nkun naf.
There was that.	Kien hemm dak.
It was so easy.	Kien daqshekk faċli.
It wasn’t going to happen.	Ma kienx se jiġri.
I want to be there when you do.	Irrid inkun hemm meta tagħmel.
They have everything they need.	Għandhom dak kollu li għandhom bżonn.
I don’t know what’s going on about this.	Ma nafx x'qed jiġri dwar dan.
I need a little help	Għandi bżonn ftit għajnuna
I had to do it	Kelli nagħmel dan
I take that.	Jien nieħu dak.
Now it didn’t look so good.	Issa ma deherx daqshekk tajjeb.
I never thought so	Qatt ma kont naħseb
I didn’t know why it was so hard for me	Ma kontx naf għaliex kien daqshekk diffiċli għalija
This was my doing.	Din kienet tagħmel tiegħi.
Maybe we should.	Forsi għandna.
He was tired.	Kien għajjien.
I hope this helps.	Nispera li dan jgħin.
I will do so soon.	Jien se nagħmel hekk dalwaqt.
Try it if you want.	Ipprova jekk trid.
You can never be.	Inti qatt ma tista 'tkun.
And no one had ever done that before.	U ħadd qatt ma kien għamel hekk qabel.
I didn’t have to wait	Ma kellix għalfejn nistenna
I have been waiting for this	Ilni nistenna dan
He knew it wasn't.	Kien jaf li ma kienx.
I love how it looks !.	Inħobb kif tidher!.
I just have to be sure	Għandi biss inkun ċert
Please let us have as soon as possible.	Jekk jogħġbok ejja għandna kemm jista' jkun malajr.
Just for me.	Għalija biss.
I know how it can be	Naf kif tista’ tkun
You should actually know this.	Għandek fil-fatt tkun taf dan.
He thought he knew what he might have been about.	Huwa ħaseb li kien jaf dak li seta 'kien dwar.
.	.
As you can tell.	Kif tista’ tgħid.
He is happy with me.	Huwa kuntent miegħi.
He doesn’t know me.	Ma jafx lili.
I thought she was very nice to tell me that	Ħsibt li kienet sabiħa ħafna li tgħidli hekk
I’m glad you did	Jien kuntent li għamilt hekk
You must really want to do something.	Int trid verament trid tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I can't think of anything to say	Ma nistax naħseb xi ngħid
No, you don’t have to tell me.	Le, m'għandekx għalfejn tgħidli.
Not good enough.	Mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
He had gone through this before.	Huwa kien għadda minn dan qabel.
No one can do that.	Ħadd ma jista 'jagħmel dan.
I didn’t want that actually	Jien ma ridtx li fil-fatt
I never wanted any of this	Jien qatt ma ridt xi ħaġa minn dan
I really hope it is	Verament nittama li jkun
I was wondering something	Kont qed nistaqsi xi ħaġa
I have no idea what he will say.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'se jgħid.
It was fast.	Kien malajr.
I wonder where they are	Nistaqsi fejn huma
He was a boy.	Kien tifel.
It is very difficult.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna.
I need to tell you something	Għandi bżonn ngħidlek xi ħaġa
She is very beautiful.	Hija sabiħa ħafna.
He didn't look happy.	Ma deherx ferħan.
It's very good.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kinitx.
I heard something about it	Smajt xi ħaġa dwarha
I hope you know that	Nistenna li taf li
I wasn’t worried.	Ma kellix inkwetat.
I don’t know how to do that.	Jien ma nafx kif nagħmel dan.
I had a few hours to think about it	Kelli ftit sigħat biex naħseb dwarha
I thought you were happy for me	Ħsibt li int kuntent għalija
I had no idea where it all came from	Ma kellix idea minn fejn ġie dak kollu
So he told me.	Hekk qalli.
They are very easy.	Huma faċli ħafna.
He just can't do it.	Huwa biss ma jistax jagħmel dan.
There he was.	Hemmhekk kien.
I'm sure it will do well.	Jien ċert li se tagħmel tajjeb.
And it is working well.	U qed jaħdem tajjeb.
But knowing is one thing.	Imma li tkun taf hija ħaġa waħda.
I'm having fun.	Qed nieħu gost.
It’s pretty hard to think otherwise.	Huwa pjuttost diffiċli li wieħed jaħseb mod ieħor.
Maybe you.	Forsi int.
I've seen it before.	Rajt qabel.
This happened this week.	Dan ġara din il-ġimgħa.
I almost knew it would	Kważi kont naf li kieku
He will either come around or he will leave.	Hu ser jew jiġi madwar jew hu ser jitlaq.
Maybe not for me, but for you.	Forsi mhux għalija, imma għalik.
I need someone out there who knows what they're doing	Għandi bżonn xi ħadd hemmhekk li jaf x'qed jagħmlu
It's really, really good.	Huwa tassew, tassew tajjeb.
I wasn’t sure what would happen after that	Ma kontx ċert x'se jiġri wara dak
I have to think of nothing	Ikolli naħseb ta 'xejn
I wonder why this happens.	Nistaqsi għaliex jiġri dan.
I am doing something wrong.	Qed nagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina.
It just works better that way.	Huwa biss jaħdem aħjar hekk.
I thought I was doing that too	Ħsibt li kont qed tagħmel hekk ukoll
She just.	Hija biss.
He would have had one.	Kieku kellu wieħed.
So many years.	Tant snin.
I didn’t believe it, you see	Ma kontx nemmen, tara
I never wanted to be someone like that	Qatt ma ridt inkun xi ħadd hekk
I was too tired	Kont għajjien wisq
I was so very.	Kont hekk ħafna.
I want you to tell me all about it	Irrid li tgħidli kollox dwarha
The book was not finished.	Il-ktieb ma kienx lest.
Now, that’s not everyone, of course.	Issa, dan mhux kulħadd, ovvjament.
Better than good, really.	Aħjar milli tajjeb, tassew.
I can't stay home today	Ma nistax noqgħod id-dar illum
I need enough time	Għandi bżonn biżżejjed ħin
She is really good.	Hija tassew tajba.
You said no.	Inti għidt li le.
I thought	Ħsibt
I knew what had happened	Kont naf x’ġara
More than that, maybe.	Aktar minn hekk, forsi.
I wonder why.	Qed nistaqsi għaliex.
But she was not able to.	Imma ma kinitx kapaċi.
I believe so.	Nemmen hekk.
It's working pretty well.	Qed jaħdem pjuttost tajjeb.
You will be very happy.	Int tkun kuntent ħafna.
If you didn't, surely you would.	Jekk inti ma, żgur li kieku.
It was going to be good.	Kien se jkun tajjeb.
This was not.	Dan ma kienx.
I'm good and happy.	Jien tajjeb u kuntent.
That wasn’t going to happen anymore.	Dak ma kienx se jiġri aktar.
I just have to believe	Ikolli biss nemmen
I knew he was happy	Kont naf li kien kuntent
I was not able to see very well	Ma kontx kapaċi nara tajjeb ħafna
All this.	Dan kollu.
This is just one.	Din hija waħda biss.
It seems I can’t understand this.	Jidher li ma nistax nifhem dan.
I need to do this on my own	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan waħdi
I was surprised by that	Jien kont sorpriż b’dan, fil-fatt
But this should not be.	Imma dan m'għandux ikun.
I'm sorry but that's the way it is	Jiddispjaċini imma hekk hu
I just wanted to be alone	Ridt biss inkun waħdi
They're out of here.	Huma qed barra minn hawn.
There is no other way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor.
Not just you.	Mhux int biss.
Another, and another.	Ieħor, u ieħor.
She'll be back, he thought.	Hija ser tkun lura, ħaseb.
I don’t know where I’m going.	Ma nafx fejn sejjer.
They were just the two of them now.	Kienu biss it-tnejn li huma issa.
I can't think of anything else to do	Ma nistax naħseb li nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra
I can’t believe you told me this	Ma nistax nemmen li qalli dan
I hope all is well with you.	Nittama li kollox tajjeb miegħek.
Not another.	Mhux ieħor.
No one took this.	Ħadd ma ħa dan.
I didn’t need to say so.	Ma kellix bżonn ngħid hekk.
I need to do that.	Għandi bżonn li tagħmel dan.
She really knew how to do things.	Kienet tassew taf kif tagħmel l-affarijiet.
I have to sit here and watch it happen	Ikolli noqgħod hawn u nara dan jiġri
Neither do I.	Jien lanqas.
It’s quite another thing.	Hija ħaġa pjuttost oħra.
I knew who he was now	Kont naf min kien issa
I thought he was a good man for you	Ħsibt li hu raġel tajjeb għalik
You can do that.	Tista 'tagħmel dan.
I didn’t want to think about it	Ma ridtx naħseb dwarha
This later.	Dan aktar tard.
I should probably go	Probabbilment għandi nkun immur
Well, it wasn’t.	Ukoll, ma kienx.
But it was a very beautiful thing.	Imma kienet ħaġa sabiħa ħafna.
I do that.	Jien nagħmel dan.
He definitely did a lot for this.	Żgur li għamel ħafna għal dan.
I have something better that will fit	Għandi xi ħaġa aħjar li se toqgħod
I had heard enough	Kont smajt biżżejjed
I don’t have to talk to him.	M'għandix għalfejn nitkellem miegħu.
I tell you this	Jien ngħidlek dan
He is leaving in a few hours.	Qed jitlaq fi ftit sigħat.
I believe everyone knows a person like that	Nemmen li kulħadd jaf persuna bħal dik
I was counting on that	Jien kont noqgħod fuq dan
I have no money	M'għandix flus
He wanted to speak yesterday.	Ried jitkellem ilbieraħ.
That's not what it is.	Dak mhux dak li hu.
I wanted to be me.	Ridt inkun jien.
But more on that later.	Imma aktar dwar dan aktar tard.
Not long now.	Mhux twil issa.
That's what you want.	Dik hi dik li trid.
I understand why it all happened	Nifhem għaliex kollox ġara
I never wanted anything	Qatt ma ridt għal xejn
Everyone had to be at work.	Kulħadd kellu jkun fuq ix-xogħol.
I’m not good enough.	Jien mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
Everyone was getting what they wanted from this.	Kulħadd kien qed jieħu dak li ried minn dan.
I can't even be sure she ever had them	Lanqas nista’ nkun ċert li qatt kellha dawn
There is a problem, of course.	Hemm problema, ovvjament.
I want to be alone, today	Irrid inkun waħdi, illum
I wanted to go alone	Ridt immur waħdi
And here it was.	U hawn kien.
I will try to do better	Se nipprova nagħmel aħjar
I can’t believe all this, all that	Ma nistax nemmen dan kollu, dak kollu
I don't have much time	M'għandix ħafna ħin
You have heard.	Għandek smajt.
I'll try	Jien ser nipprova
I want to see if this will actually work.	Irrid nara jekk dan hux se jaħdem fil-fatt.
You're what you do.	Int dak li tagħmel.
For a long time I had no one.	Għal żmien twil ma kelli lil ħadd.
I can't think so	Ma nistax naħseb hekk
There are such people.	Hemm nies bħal dawn.
Expectable.	Ta’ min jistenna.
He can't do that it didn't happen.	Huwa ma jistax jagħmel dan ma ġara.
You must appear to be doing this.	Trid tidher li qed tagħmel dan.
He said.	Qal.
Well pretty big.	Ukoll pjuttost kbir.
I try not to be friends with anyone.	Nipprova ma nkun ħbieb ma' ħadd.
But how much, how much.	Imma kemm, kemm.
This seems to be much harder than it seems.	Dan jidher li huwa ħafna aktar diffiċli milli jidher.
It is.	Huwa.
And she would want to.	U hi tkun trid.
He looked great there.	Huwa ħares kbir hemmhekk.
Everyone started talking about it.	Kulħadd beda jitkellem dwarha.
Most people do this.	Ħafna nies jagħmlu dan.
I just can’t do that	Jien biss ma nistax nagħmel dan
No one came here.	Ħadd ma ġie hawn.
I was there	Jien kont qiegħed hemm
Like, right now.	Bħal, bħalissa.
Not for many years, actually.	Mhux għal ħafna snin, fil-fatt.
We had.	Kellna.
But there is one thing we know.	Imma hemm ħaġa waħda li nafu.
He had many friends.	Kellu ħafna ħbieb.
I have a lot of fun when it comes to talking	Jien nieħu gost ħafna meta jiġi biex jitkellem
He is so happy that she is here.	Huwa tant kuntent li hi hawn.
Can anyone help.	Jista' xi ħadd jgħin.
She is a very easy boy.	Hija tifel faċli ħafna.
More than I wanted to know.	Aktar milli ridt tkun taf.
I said too much	Għidt wisq
I shouldn’t be long.	M'għandix inkun twil.
When she was not with him.	Meta hi ma kinitx miegħu.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
But this would not be difficult.	Imma dan ma jkunx diffiċli.
You know why, of course.	Taf għaliex, ovvjament.
How I was doing that.	Kif kont nagħmel hekk.
She hardly had.	Ma tantx kellha.
I want to try to be happier	Irrid nipprova nkun aktar ferħan
She is there now.	Hija hemm issa.
I'm here again.	Jien hawn nerġa' nagħmel hekk.
I wonder what we will do tomorrow	Nistaqsi x’se nagħmlu għada
I can’t talk to him about what’s going on.	Ma nistax nitkellem miegħu dwar dak li qed jiġri.
And you would be so good.	U int tkun daqshekk tajjeb.
I can’t believe this is happening	Ma nistax nemmen li dan qed jiġri
She will be watching.	Hija se tkun qed tara.
I did everything	Jien għamilt kollox
He did nothing, it seems.	Huwa ma għamel xejn, jidher.
Much more.	Ħafna aktar.
I think she is.	Naħseb li hi.
He should not stay here.	M’għandux jibqa’ hawn.
It seems like too much work.	Jidher qisu wisq xogħol.
Everyone was out.	Kulħadd kien barra.
It was the door.	Kien il-bieb.
If only.	Kieku biss.
And whatever it is, you know.	U dak kollu li hu, taf.
Not sure how to go about it.	Mhux ċert kif għandek tmur dwar dan.
I thought about it for a long time.	Ħsibt dwarha għal żmien twil.
I think this was not a good idea	Naħseb li din ma kinitx idea tajba
This can be wrong.	Dan jista 'jkun ħażin.
Everything can wait.	Kollox jista’ jistenna.
And now we're back.	U issa aħna qed lura.
But you know it was.	Imma taf li kien.
I was quite happy.	Kont pjuttost kuntent.
I had no idea where all this was going	Ma kellix idea fejn kien sejjer dan kollu
I never say never.	Qatt ma ngħid qatt.
She knows.	Hija taf.
And maybe you can’t do that.	U forsi ma tistax tagħmel dan.
You can also go to your school.	Barra minn hekk tista’ tmur l-iskola tiegħek.
It's not much.	Mhuwiex ħafna.
I knew what was going to happen	Kont naf x’kien se jiġri
This should be no.	Dan għandu jkun le.
The first will not.	L-ewwel mhux se.
You can do it !!.	Tista' tagħmel dan!!.
Neither do you.	U lanqas int.
I love this dog.	Inħobb dan il-kelb.
I will do whatever it takes.	Jien se nagħmel dak kollu li hemm bżonn.
I want to be the last.	Irrid inkun l-aħħar.
Just a little bit of what happens.	Ftit ftit minn dak li jiġri.
I had no idea	Jien ma kelli l-ebda idea
A few years later the same thing	Ftit snin wara l-istess ħaġa
You were just a child.	Inti kont tifel biss.
You were alone.	Int kont waħdek.
I have a lot of that	Għandi ħafna minn hekk
I was glad it wasn’t	Kont ferħan li ma kienx
Which is pretty long.	Li huwa pjuttost twil.
It was me.	Jien kont jien.
That was then, this now.	Dak kien dak iż-żmien, dan issa.
I was going to do this by noon	Kont se nagħmel dan sa nofsinhar
Which, of course, was.	Li, ovvjament, kien.
See how this works.	Tara kif jaħdem dan.
I did enough.	Għamilt biżżejjed.
I didn’t think he was a bad man	Ma kontx naħseb li hu raġel ħażin
I can’t say much more right now	Ma nistax ngħid ħafna aktar bħalissa
I wasn't expecting it	Ma kontx qed nistenna
If not, no.	Jekk le, le.
I knew what he was thinking	Kont naf x’kien qed jaħseb
You know how to do it.	Inti taf kif tagħmel dan.
I was going to do things and be someone	Kont se nagħmel l-affarijiet u nkun xi ħadd
I never do.	Jien qatt ma nagħmel.
I have to go.	Għandi mmur.
I just wanted that tomorrow evening	Ridt biss li għada filgħaxija
I thought it was.	Ħsibt li kien.
That was not good.	Dak ma kienx tajjeb.
That would be too easy for me.	Dan ikun faċli wisq għalija.
They are with us.	Huma magħna.
So is mine.	Hekk ukoll tiegħi.
He wanted to help.	Ried jgħin.
I thought it was a good idea.	Ħsibt li kienet idea tajba.
And they do.	U jagħmlu dan.
Not sure how or why.	Mhux ċert kif jew għaliex.
That's what.	Dak hu dak.
I’m pretty sure of that	Jiena pjuttost ċert minn dan
It wasn’t enough, of course.	Ma kienx biżżejjed, ovvjament.
I think more scared than anything	Naħseb aktar jibża minn kull ħaġa
I knew this was coming for a long time	Kont naf li dan kien ġej għal żmien twil
I’ve been really busy lately	Jien kont tassew okkupat dan l-aħħar
No one was here who shouldn’t have been.	Ħadd ma kien hawn li ma kellux ikun.
I just need to be alone	Għandi bżonn biss li nkun waħdi
I wasn’t entirely sure	Ma kontx ċert għal kollox
I thought she had.	Ħsibt li kellha.
I was sure she was	Kont ċert li kienet hi
I was definitely surprised	Żgur kont sorpriż
But only a few.	Imma ftit biss.
Everything has always been easy for him.	Kollox dejjem ġie faċli għalih.
I do everything for you.	Jien nagħmel kollox għalik.
I know he was telling the truth	Naf li kien qed jgħid il-verità
There will never be another exactly the same.	Qatt mhu se jkun hemm ieħor eżatt l-istess.
I was glad he was there.	Kont ferħan li kien hemm.
I just wanted to talk	Ridt biss nitkellem
But, no, it won’t.	Imma, le, mhux se.
I thought it was a good idea	Ħsibt li kienet idea tajba
She is very tired when she comes home.	Hija għajjien ħafna meta tiġi d-dar.
But maybe not so bad.	Imma forsi mhux daqshekk ħażin.
You know who you are.	Taf min int.
But it was good.	Imma kien tajjeb.
But you had to think.	Imma kellek taħseb.
Better way to say no, don’t.	Mod aħjar kif tgħid li le, m'għandekx.
Now he knew why.	Issa kien jaf għaliex.
I think it might help	Naħseb li jista 'jgħin
But she wants more.	Imma hi trid aktar.
I needed the book tomorrow	Jien kelli bżonn il-ktieb għada
This is going to be great.	Dan se jkun kbir.
And it wasn't.	U ma kienx.
I have no idea how much	M'għandix idea kemm
I was there.	Kont hemm.
He wanted the truth.	Ried il-verità.
It can’t be that there isn’t.	Ma jistax ikun li ma jkunx hemm.
I couldn't do anything	Ma stajt nagħmel xejn
Just too much.	Biss wisq.
You're that morning.	Int dak filgħodu.
He didn’t want to talk about it, either.	Hu ma riedx jitkellem dwarha, lanqas.
I had no idea where he came from	Ma kellix idea minn fejn ġie
I want to know what's going on	Irrid inkun naf x'qed jiġri
But we can do much better.	Imma nistgħu nagħmlu ħafna aħjar.
He had started now.	Huwa kien beda issa.
We want to be better.	Irridu nkunu aħjar.
Have a good time	Għandhom ħin tajjeb
On, and on, and on.	Fuq, u fuq, u fuq.
That should be fine.	Dak għandu jkun tajjeb.
I can never do that for you	Jien qatt ma nista 'nagħmel dan għalik
They were very helpful.	Kienu ta’ għajnuna kbira.
It’s right here, actually.	Huwa eżatt hawn, fil-fatt.
No one else here seems to have.	Ħadd ieħor hawn jidher li għandu.
You think so, but no.	Inti taħseb hekk, imma mhux.
You do it all the time.	Inti tagħmel dan il-ħin kollu.
Just about everyone.	Biss dwar kulħadd.
We have no idea.	M'għandniex idea.
I'm telling you the truth	Jien ngħidlek il-verità
I didn’t want to hear any more	Ma ridtx nisma aktar
I tell you one thing	Jien ngħidlek ħaġa waħda
He didn't even want to think.	Lanqas ma ried jaħseb.
He was glad to be here.	Kien kuntent li qiegħed hawn.
I knew it had to be me	Kont naf li kellu jkun għalija
I saw both of them	Rajt it-tnejn li huma
I didn't know what was going on	Ma kontx naf x’qed jiġri
I know you know that.	Naf li taf li.
But definitely not now.	Imma żgur mhux issa.
And that was a long time.	U dak kien żmien twil.
It goes well.	Imur tajjeb.
This house is your home.	Din id-dar hija d-dar tiegħek.
Nor does it seem to have much more.	Lanqas ma jidher li għandu ħafna aktar.
The work is good.	Ix-xogħol huwa tajjeb.
I don’t need this job.	M'għandix bżonn dan ix-xogħol.
They were together.	Kienu flimkien.
I died alone.	I miet waħdi.
He can do whatever he wants.	Jista’ jagħmel li jrid.
I saw other things	Rajt affarijiet oħra
It was ready.	Kien lest.
There, you can go now.	Hemmhekk, tista' tmur issa.
That’s not bad either.	Dik mhux ħażin lanqas.
He must have told me so.	Huwa għandu kemm qalli hekk.
I couldn't tell you.	Ma stajtx ngħidlek.
I know what's going on	Naf x’qed isir
I wonder if that’s what’s happening here	Nistaqsi jekk hux dak li qed jiġri hawn
Now, we have to go.	Issa, irridu mmorru.
I want to hear all about it	Irrid nisma' kollox dwarha
Everyone is doing the work.	Kulħadd qed jagħmel ix-xogħol.
I shouldn't be here	M'għandix inkun hawn
And so much more !!.	U tant aktar!!.
This is too good.	Dan huwa tajjeb wisq.
I couldn’t talk or anything	Ma stajtx nitkellem jew xejn
I can't tell you who	Ma nistax ngħidlek min
Can't wait.	Ma jistax jistenna.
I can never think of that	Qatt ma nista' naħseb hekk
There couldn’t be such a big one here.	Ma setax ikun hemm wieħed daqshekk kbir hawn.
Or better yet, don’t talk.	Jew aħjar, ma titkellem.
You would know what you are doing.	Kieku taf x'qed tagħmel.
I wasn’t nearly ready for that	Jien ma kontx kważi lest għal dan
I have to tell someone.	Ikolli ngħid lil xi ħadd.
He was not ready.	Ma kienx lest.
I’ll tell you before it happens	Jien ngħidlek qabel ma jiġri
Anything you like.	Xi ħaġa li tixtieq.
You know, and that’s great.	Taf, u dan huwa kbir.
You will have everything you need.	Inti ser kull dak kollu li għandek bżonn.
But no one thought about it.	Imma ħadd ma ħaseb dwarha.
By this time, she was not good.	Sa dan iż-żmien, hija ma kinitx tajba.
And it may not be.	U jista 'ma jkunx.
You are with me.	Inti miegħi.
And you can be !.	U tista tkun!.
I’m not sure how I’m going to do that.	M'inix ċert kif se nagħmel dan.
I didn’t think I would ever come back.	Ma kontx naħseb li qatt ġejt lura.
People here.	Nies hawn.
I didn't know what happened	Ma kontx naf x’ġara
She really didn't know.	Hija verament ma kinitx taf.
I’m not entirely sure what happened from that.	M'inix ċert għal kollox x'ġara minn hekk.
I have no idea what happened after that	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'ġara wara dak
I hope it was going well	Jien nittama li kien sejjer tajjeb
I need to go back there.	Għandi bżonn immur lura hemm.
She did it all on her own.	Hija għamlet dan kollu waħedha.
This is not how it should be.	Dan mhux kif għandu jkun.
I know he does.	Naf li jagħmel.
I almost wish there was more need	Kważi nixtieq li jkun hemm aktar bżonn
I know how busy you are.	Naf kemm int okkupat.
I have no idea how this just happened	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif dan għadu kif ġara
I just thought maybe you want your book	Ħsibt biss li forsi trid il-ktieb tiegħek
Obviously I wasn’t.	Ovvjament ma kontx.
I need to try to stay	Għandi bżonn nipprova noqgħod
I still think we can do that	Għadni naħseb li nistgħu nagħmlu dan
They always were	Dejjem kienu
I’m, after all, almost the same	Jien, wara kollox, kważi l-istess
Maybe this helps someone else.	Forsi dan jgħin lil xi ħadd ieħor.
I did exactly as he said	Għamilt eżatt kif qal hu
I had to be there for you	I kellha tkun hemm għalik
Nista.	Nista.
And we go from here to there what we do.	U mmorru minn hawn għal hemm dak li nagħmlu.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Ma kien xejn ħażin.
I knew it was him	Kont naf li kien hu
That was still the same.	Dak kien għadu l-istess.
I didn’t have that, either	Jien ma kellix dak, lanqas
Come on.	Ejja ftit.
I had to be more at home	Kelli nkun aktar id-dar
And why.	U għaliex.
I have to go there tomorrow	Għandi mmur hemm għada
I’ve been around a few times	Kont ġejt madwar ftit drabi
I didn’t expect to ever love it	Ma kontx nistenna li qatt inħobb
I can't see who she is	Ma nistax nara min hi
Where do you want to go first ?.	Fejn trid tmur l-ewwel?.
I didn’t have to go myself	Ma kellix għalfejn immur jien
He needed to know what was going on.	Kellu jkun jaf x’kien qed jiġri.
That has to be something.	Dik trid tkun xi ħaġa.
Someone back.	Xi ħadd lura.
I couldn’t do anything, I see no one.	Jien ma stajt nagħmel xejn, nara lil ħadd.
We will be who we are.	Se nkunu min aħna.
You have to see this.	Int għandek tara dan.
But she is a boy.	Imma hi tifel.
I did nothing wrong	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin
I was not what he needed help with	Jien ma kontx dak li kellu bżonn l-għajnuna
I wanted to be with you before	Ridt li ġie magħna qabel
I have no idea what that is	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'inhu dak
And they are my good friends.	U huma ħbieb tajba tiegħi.
Not too sure why.	Mhux wisq ċert għaliex.
But here's a problem.	Imma hawn problema.
It really isn't.	Huwa verament mhux.
I thought you would be ready sooner	Ħsibt li inti tkun lest qabel
He didn’t ask much about it.	Ma tantx staqsa dwar dan.
He doesn’t like to talk about it.	Ma jħobbx jitkellem dwarha.
I would like to be here more	Nixtieq li tkun hawn aktar
That's the good thing.	Huwa dak tajjeb.
It just seems great.	Jidher biss kbir.
It can never be too early.	Qatt ma tista’ tkun kmieni wisq.
He didn’t know why, but they were there.	Ma kienx jaf għaliex, imma kienu hemmhekk.
I didn't have time to be afraid	Ma kellix ħin biex nibża’
I can’t even think about it	Ma nistax lanqas naħseb dwarha
I have some work that I need to do there	Għandi xi xogħol li jeħtieġ nagħmel hemmhekk
Well, of course it was.	Ukoll, ovvjament kien.
I have been thinking about this for a long time.	Ilni naħseb dwar dan.
I was so scared	Kont nibża’ daqshekk
I only ask one thing	Nistaqsi ħaġa waħda biss
I heard little, I saw nothing	Smajt ftit, ma rajt xejn
I didn’t know it was going to be a problem	Ma kontx naf li kienet se tkun problema
I think it would be a lot easier	Naħseb li jkun ħafna aktar faċli
She can only do so much.	Hija tista 'biss tagħmel daqshekk.
I will go there as well.	Jien se mmur hemm ukoll.
I have been doing this for a very long time	Ilni nagħmel dan għal żmien twil ħafna
I want to know where I am so far	Irrid inkun naf fejn kont sa issa
I think it's too late	Naħseb li jiġi tard wisq
So she did today.	Hekk għamlet illum.
The weather seemed good.	Il-ħin deher tajjeb.
I have no way of knowing for sure.	M'għandi l-ebda mod kif inkun naf żgur.
I want to be able to see things	Irrid inkun qed nara l-affarijiet
I definitely didn’t want to	Żgur li ma ridtx
I said he shouldn't have come home	Għidt li ma kellux jiġi d-dar
I need help with this	Għandi bżonn għajnuna b'dan
Such things.	Affarijiet bħal dawn.
I do this every time.	Dan nagħmel kull darba.
On and off !.	Fuq u barra!.
I’m always too busy, for nothing	Jien dejjem okkupat wisq, għal xejn
I could see everything	Stajt nara kollox
I think to see where everyone was	Naħseb biex nara fejn kien kulħadd
I want to do things	Irrid nagħmel l-affarijiet
Everyone knows what's going on.	Kulħadd jaf x’inhu jiġri.
I wasn’t that great.	Jien ma kontx daqshekk kbir.
And it should be.	U għandu jkun.
Nothing happens alone.	Xejn ma jiġri waħdu.
I think this is not a good idea right now	Naħseb li din mhix idea tajba bħalissa
That was good for me.	Dak kien tajjeb minni.
I can’t have many more years	Ma nistax ikolli ħafna snin oħra
This is just how it happens.	Dan huwa biss kif jiġri.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
he will say.	hu ser jgħid.
It doesn't look like much.	Ma tantx qisu.
I knew it would.	Kont naf li kieku.
I needed to see it there	Kelli bżonn nara hawn hemmhekk
Long time no see.	Żmien twil tagħmel dan.
I knew I was there	Kont naf li kont hemm
I only had one chance	Kelli ċans wieħed biss
All this had happened before.	Dan kollu kien ġara qabel.
What we have.	Dak li għandna.
You can't know.	Ma tistax tkun taf.
He never told anyone about it.	Qatt ma qal lil ħadd dwarha.
I know I was there	Naf li kont hemm
I'm not sure about that.	M'inix ċert dwar dan.
This is no longer working.	Dan mhux qed jaħdem aktar.
What's wrong with me? 	X'inhu ħażin miegħi?
It's not good.	Mhuwiex tajjeb.
One at a time, or both at once.	Wieħed kull darba, jew it-tnejn flimkien.
This looked good.	Dan deher tajjeb.
I have seen it happen many times	Rajt jiġri ħafna drabi
I can't do anything about it now	Ma nistax nagħmel xejn dwarha issa
Or something else.	Jew xi ħaġa oħra.
Nobody knows right now.	Ħadd ma jaf bħalissa.
No one left.	Ħadd ma telaq.
I'm glad you have	Jien ferħan li għandek
Something that is just.	Xi ħaġa li hu biss.
I will never, ever believe it	Jien qatt, qatt mhu se nemmen
I can't see this anymore	Ma nistax nara dan aktar
But so it began.	Imma hekk beda.
I need to talk to you.	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek.
Surely they were.	Żgur li kienu.
At the time, there was nothing.	Dak iż-żmien, ma kien hemm xejn.
I have to wait around like everyone else.	Ikolli nistenna madwar bħal kulħadd.
I can tell you now.	Nista’ ngħidlek issa.
I’m not sure why this is so	M'inix ċert għaliex dan huwa hekk
He seemed too tired to speak.	Deher għajjien wisq biex jitkellem.
It’s a beautiful thing to do and see.	Hija ħaġa sabiħa li tagħmel u tara.
I’ve never thought about it before	Jien qatt ma naħseb dwar dan qabel
This may be so.	Dan jista 'jkun hekk.
I had gone there once.	Jien kont mort hemm darba.
In fact they are one and the same thing.	Fil-fatt huma l-istess ħaġa waħda.
I couldn’t really tell.	Ma stajtx verament ngħid.
I saw that years ago	Rajt li snin ilu
I couldn’t believe this was actually happening	Ma stajtx nemmen li dan kien qed jiġri fil-fatt
I don't need to hear that.	M'għandix bżonn nisma' dan.
I knew it was too much, too fast	Kont naf li kien wisq, malajr wisq
I know you want to go.	Naf li trid tmur.
I’m not going to settle for that	Jien mhux se noqgħod għal dan
I just had to say so	Kelli biss ngħid hekk
I just came from there	Jien biss ġejt minn hemm
A little more, he thought.	Ftit ieħor, ħaseb.
I was making time	Kont qed nagħmel il-ħin
I was going to wait and see what happened.	Jien kont se nistenna u nara x'ġara.
Obviously I can’t be friends with him	Ovvjament ma nistax inkun ħbieb miegħu
What will happen?	X'se jiġri?.
Not like before, but.	Mhux bħal qabel, imma.
It really works.	Tassew jaħdem.
I was trying too hard.	Kont qed nipprova wisq.
I really hope you can as well	Verament nittama li inti tista 'kif hekk
I had never thought of it before	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwarha qabel
I hope he comes back to us someday	Jien nittama li xi darba jiġi lura għandna
But it’s not the whole truth.	Imma mhix il-verità kollha.
I have nothing more to say.	M'għandix aktar xi ngħid.
I heard things, of course	Smajt affarijiet, ovvjament
This can happen to anyone.	Dan jista' jiġri lil kulħadd.
I didn't know what happened	Ma kontx naf x’ġara
That was not enough.	Dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
More than anything and by everyone.	Aktar minn kollox u minn kulħadd.
It looks like years ago.	Jidher qisu snin ilu.
I thought this is what I wanted	Ħsibt li dan huwa dak li ridt
From what he saw, apparently not.	Minn dak li ra, milli jidher le.
I'm still not.	Jien għadni ma.
He always has been.	Huwa dejjem kien.
I have one of my own	Għandi waħda minn tiegħi
Long, long time.	Żmien twil, twil.
Well, it wasn’t great for us.	Ukoll, ma kienx kbir għalina.
It was already difficult.	Kien diġà diffiċli.
Everything went wrong.	Kollox mar ħażin.
I will have to try a lot more	Ikolli nipprova ħafna aktar
And we had.	U kellna.
I look forward to hearing something	Nistenna biex nisma xi ħaġa
Only one took.	Wieħed biss ħa.
Usually this works out.	Normalment dan jaħdem barra.
I didn't want anyone to know	Ma ridt li ħadd ikun jaf
How far it will come is another.	Kemm se jasal huwa ieħor.
He doesn't know what he's doing.	Ma jafx x’qed jagħmel.
Not for that.	Mhux għal dan.
I can’t wait, actually	Ma nistax nistenna, fil-fatt
The same happens at work.	L-istess jiġri fuq ix-xogħol.
I have yet to see what will happen.	Għadni rrid nara x'se jiġri.
I'm not why.	Jien ma għaliex.
I wasn’t sure if he actually had one	Ma kontx ċert jekk fil-fatt kellux wieħed
I think he did a little more today	Naħseb li għamel ftit aktar illum
It's good.	Huwa tajjeb.
No one else knows.	Ħadd ieħor ma jaf.
Don’t do it, whatever you do.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan, tkun xi tkun għamilt.
It was hard to see.	Kien diffiċli biex tara.
I never wanted someone so bad	Qatt ma ridt lil xi ħadd daqshekk ħażin
I was happy about it.	Kont kuntent dwar dan.
I was hoping for something like this.	Jien kont nittama għal xi ħaġa bħal din.
I have to go home.	Għandi mmur id-dar.
I'm glad you're here.	Jien kuntent li int hawn.
It was hard for him.	Kien diffiċli għalih.
Not there, either.	Mhux hemm, lanqas.
I'm not right.	Jien m'iniex raġun.
I did as he did	Għamilt kif kien għamel hu
I’m not home, this is not home.	Jien mhux id-dar, din mhix id-dar.
Try it, she says.	Ipprova, tgħid hi.
No, it's not always late.	Le, mhux dejjem ikun tard.
I usually did.	Normalment għamilt.
He is working on another.	Qed jaħdem fuq ieħor.
All these things.	Dawn l-affarijiet kollha.
I don’t know where he is.	Ma nafx fejn hu.
I had no idea where I was	Ma kellix idea fejn għandi
Not that he knew.	Mhux li kien ikun jaf.
This is also good.	Dan ukoll tajjeb.
I didn’t want to drive	Ma ridtx isuq
This could be.	Dan jista’ jkun.
I want that for you and me.	Irrid dak għalik u għalija.
I know what it is.	Naf x'inhu.
I have no idea who has me	M'għandi l-ebda idea min għandu lili
I didn’t know this was hard for him.	Ma kontx naf li dan kien diffiċli għalih.
You were saying.	Kont qed tgħid.
I hope so.	Nittama hekk.
I think she is.	Naħseb li hi.
You did very well on these.	Inti għamilt tajjeb ħafna fuq dawn.
We should not be here.	M'għandniex nkunu hawn.
I’m glad for these things	Jien ferħan għal dawn l-affarijiet
One can never say.	Wieħed qatt ma jista’ jgħid.
This house I am.	Din id-dar jien.
I didn’t do that	Jien ma kontx nagħmel dan
He is not a bad man.	Mhuwiex raġel ħażin.
Usually she does a better job.	Normalment hi tagħmel xogħol aħjar.
Mine wasn’t the only one.	Tiegħi ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
There had to be a way for this to work.	Kellu jkun hemm mod kif dan jaħdem.
It wasn’t us, of course.	Ma kienx aħna, ovvjament.
And this has happened many times since	U dan ġara ħafna drabi wara
I will not expect any help	Mhux se nistenna l-ebda għajnuna
He can go home.	Jista’ jmur lura d-dar.
I can't understand what you're saying	Ma nistax nifhem x’qed tgħid
It works very fast.	Jaħdem malajr ħafna.
I didn’t have to come to school	Ma kellix ġej l-iskola
Only both.	It-tnejn biss.
He is always there.	Huwa dejjem hemm.
I needed to hear more	Kelli bżonn nisma’ aktar
No, of course, it wasn’t there.	Le, ovvjament, ma kienx hemm.
If she is there.	Jekk hi hemm.
A while ago.	Ftit ilu.
Probably not until this afternoon.	Probabbilment mhux sa llum wara nofsinhar.
I went home and he was not here.	Mort id-dar u hu ma kienx hawn.
It's better.	Huwa aħjar.
It looked good.	Deher tajjeb.
He was good with that.	Huwa kien tajjeb ma 'dak.
I didn’t need his help	Ma kellix bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħu
I need to know where this is going	Għandi bżonn inkun naf fejn sejjer dan
Or try.	Jew ipprova.
Or not, now that he’s thought about it.	Jew le, issa li ħaseb dwarha.
And not only that.	U mhux hekk biss.
I'm doing very well.	Jien sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
He was so scared.	Hekk kien jibża’.
You have to think like a man.	Trid taħseb bħal raġel.
To do.	Biex tagħmel.
I couldn't think of that.	Ma stajtx naħseb hekk.
It's much better now.	Huwa ħafna aħjar issa.
I look forward to it	Nistenna li jibqa' hekk
Surely we know that now	Żgur li nafu li issa
It happened to both me and my friend.	Ġara kemm lili kif ukoll lil ħabib tiegħi.
I'm almost done	Jien kważi lest
He does the work.	Huwa jagħmel ix-xogħol.
I still can't tell you the truth	Għadni ma nistax ngħidlek il-verità
I just finished.	Għadni kif lest.
There must be.	Għandu jkun hemm.
He still does the same.	Għadu jagħmel l-istess.
I should have been watching things	Kelli nkun qed nara l-affarijiet
There was no one around.	Ma kien hemm ħadd madwar.
It looks great.	Qed jidher tajjeb ħafna.
I could never understand that	Qatt ma stajt nifhem hekk
There will be soon.	Se jkun hemm dalwaqt.
I was so tired of this	Kont tant għajjien b’dan
You too were a child.	Int ukoll kont tifel.
It's not really like that.	Mhuwiex verament hekk.
I don’t think you do.	Ma naħsibx li tagħmel.
Everything was fine.	Kollox kien tajjeb.
I thought it was a good one	Ħsibt li kienet waħda tajba
He knew so much.	Kien jaf daqshekk.
You want to tell me how you know.	Trid tgħidli kif taf.
Work has now started well.	Ix-xogħol issa beda tajjeb.
I didn't know where you were	Ma kontx naf fejn int
It was a good time.	Kien żmien tajjeb.
I can't do this with you anymore	Ma nistax nagħmel dan miegħek aktar
So was she.	Hekk kienet hi.
It was starting to go wrong.	Kien beda jmur ħażin.
And so it goes.	U hekk imur.
I wanted to see who was thinking alone	Ridt nara min kien qed jaħseb waħdu
But that was a long time ago.	Imma dak kien żmien twil ilu.
This will make everyone happy.	Dan se jagħmel lil kulħadd kuntent.
I’m glad to be here.	Jien kuntent li nkun hawn.
There, for sure.	Hemm, żgur.
There must be a better way.	Għandu jkun hemm mod aħjar.
I can do this for him	Jien nista' nagħmel dan għalih
I saw people around	Rajt nies madwar
I wasn’t a very good one	Jien ma kontx wieħed tajjeb ħafna
It looked like something he had done before.	Deher qisu xi ħaġa li kien għamel qabel.
Like they were never there.	Bħal qatt ma kienu hemm.
That would have been home.	Dak kieku kienet id-dar.
I had never heard of such a thing.	Qatt ma kont smajt hekk.
This can be a bad idea.	Din tista’ tkun idea ħażina.
I so enjoy it.	Jien hekk nieħu gost.
I'm sorry about that	Jiddispjaċini għal dan
If he knew.	Kieku kien jaf.
I’m not going to tell you what he did to me	Jien mhux se ngħidlek dak li għamel miegħi
He doesn't know.	Ma jafx.
An easy one, perhaps.	Waħda faċli, forsi.
I always knew you were great	Dejjem kont naf li int kbir
I had never thought of it before	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwarha hekk qabel
We will make one.	Aħna se nagħmlu waħda.
He had a lot.	Kellu ħafna.
I know this is going to be difficult for you	Naf li dan għandu jkun diffiċli għalik
I was going once	Kont sejjer darba
I had to think a little more about it.	Kelli naħseb ftit aktar dwarha.
That was how we were.	Dan kien kif konna.
Just what we can do about it.	Biss dak li nistgħu nagħmlu dwarha.
I am a bit worried.	Jiena daqsxejn inkwetat.
I couldn't tell you	Ma stajtx ngħidlek
I was the only child	Jien kont l-uniku tifel
I didn't know what to believe	Ma kontx naf x’se nemmen
And it can be good.	U jista 'jkun tajjeb.
Most people do this	Ħafna nies jagħmlu dan
I try.	Nipprova.
I had nothing more to say	Ma kelli xejn aktar xi ngħid
I know people who do.	Naf nies li jagħmlu.
I can’t be sure for how long	Ma nistax inkun ċert għal kemm żmien
You will be happy.	Int tkun kuntent.
I had a job.	Kelli xogħol.
I'll be right there	Jien se nkun hemm eżatt
I thought everyone would be taking it easy	Ħsibt li kulħadd se jkun qed jieħu faċli
And when you go, you go well.	U meta tmur, tmur tajjeb.
This is working.	Dan qed jaħdem.
And it can still happen.	U għadu jista' jiġri.
But this is not really a problem.	Imma din mhix verament problema.
I knew where this was going	Kont naf fejn sejjer dan
I wanted to see how I was doing.	Ridt nara kif kont sejjer.
As it was for me.	Kif kien għalija.
I know how to speak	Naf kif titkellem verament
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi le.
I did exactly as I said	Għamilt eżatt kif għedt
We were better as we were.	Konna aħjar kif konna.
It has certainly been very often.	Żgur li ġie spiss ħafna.
I have to go back	Għandi nerġa' lura
I want you to know something	Irrid li tkun taf xi ħaġa
That was the first one.	Dik kienet l-ewwel waħda.
This takes too long.	Dan jieħu wisq żmien.
They were early.	Kienu kmieni.
I couldn't hold back	Ma stajtx toqgħod lura
I know the truth.	Naf il-verità.
I had thought of that	I kellha ħsibt ta 'dan
Eat both.	Tiekol it-tnejn.
I was going to tell you	Kont se ngħidlek
Everything looks good to me.	Kollox jidher tajjeb għalija.
I’m alone, but not alone	Jien waħdi, imma mhux waħdi
I know how I did it	Naf kif għamilt dan
It had never happened before.	Qatt ma kien ġara.
That’s so fast.	Dak hu daqshekk malajr.
Sometimes you have to tell me more than once.	Xi drabi trid tgħidli aktar minn darba.
I’m glad to be out there.	Jien ferħan li nkun barra minn hemm.
I did everything that needed to be done.	Jien għamilt dak kollu li kien hemm bżonn isir.
I want to go alone.	Irrid immur waħdi.
I thought today was yesterday	Ħsibt li llum kien il-bieraħ
I have to do something else	Ikolli nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra
Not only that.	Mhux hekk biss.
I think that's a good thing	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba
And he knew.	U kien jaf.
Maybe he can.	Forsi jista’.
I want you to come with me.	Irrid li tiġi miegħi.
I was hoping for you	Kont nittama li int
Not from me.	Mhux minni.
He has no idea what he's saying.	M’għandux idea x’qed jgħid.
Maybe that time has passed.	Forsi dak iż-żmien għadda.
I just need some time	Għandi bżonn biss ftit ħin
I know someone.	Naf lil xi ħadd.
I think he thought better of it	Naħseb li ħaseb aħjar
No, not a car.	Le, mhux karozza.
I want to have a good time with you	Irrid nagħmel ħin tajjeb miegħek
I can't be this for you	Ma nistax inkun dan għalik
I know this is not good for him.	Naf li dan mhux tajjeb għalih.
I can’t say the same for tomorrow	Ma nistax ngħid l-istess għal għada
It was great to work with.	Kien kbir biex jaħdem miegħu.
I think it wasn’t.	Jiena naħseb li ma kienx.
I’m a little tired but not bad	Jien xi ftit għajjien imma mhux ħażin
I know what that is	Naf x'inhu dan
He just wanted to talk.	Ried biss jitkellem.
Say what you want.	Għid dak li trid.
Now it was going too far.	Issa kien sejjer wisq.
He's just a man.	Huwa biss raġel.
If we knew, if everyone knew, we would do something.	Kieku konna nafu, kieku kulħadd kien jaf, konna nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
Many were not there.	Ħafna ma kienx hemm.
I’m never alone here	Jien qatt ma jien waħdi hawn
I want to stand up for you	Irrid noqgħod għalik
I needed time to think, and eat	Kelli bżonn ħin biex naħseb, u niekol
I couldn’t take too much	Ma stajtx nieħu wisq
And don’t be surprised.	U m'għandekx tkun sorpriż.
But only a few.	Imma ftit biss.
I just had to sit down for a while	I biss kelli noqgħod bilqiegħda għal ftit
He hadn’t told me much.	Ma kienx qalli ħafna.
Today, it was work.	Illum, kien xogħol.
I can't do anything for you.	Jien ma nista nagħmel xejn għalik.
I have to think of something	Ikolli naħseb xi ħaġa
Maybe he should before.	Forsi għandu qabel.
I’m willing to try so hard	Jien lest li nipprova tant
You look beautiful.	Inti tidher sabiħa.
But it doesn’t seem to be working.	Imma jidher li mhux qed jaħdem.
It was hard for him.	Kien diffiċli għalih.
Let's do this.	Ejja nagħmlu dan.
I have a son too.	Għandi tifel ukoll.
I can prove it.	Jien nista' nipprova dan.
He is not there.	Hu mhux hemm.
But you should know.	Imma għandek tkun taf.
He came in there.	Huwa daħal hemmhekk.
I have one of my own.	Għandi waħda minn tiegħi.
I understand that now.	Nifhem li issa.
I wish it wasn’t so	Nixtieq li ma kienx hekk
There was a little more money on.	Kien hemm ftit aktar flus dwar.
Not one thing.	Mhux ħaġa waħda.
I try to be happy again	Nipprova nerġa’ nkun kuntent
He still didn’t know enough about it.	Għadu ma kienx jaf biżżejjed dwarha.
And it was a good thing he did.	U kienet ħaġa tajba li għamel.
Or maybe a lot.	Jew forsi ħafna.
I was one with the other	Jien kont ħaġa waħda ma’ dak li kien bħalissa
It only works now.	Jaħdem biss issa.
Good actually.	Tajjeb fil-fatt.
I can't tell you everything	Ma nistax ngħidlek kollox
And much more after that.	U ħafna aktar wara dak.
To be great.	Biex tkun kbir.
It’s just the same way for us.	Huwa eżatt l-istess mod għalina.
In fact, nothing came of it.	Fil-fatt, ma wasal xejn.
This is not so easy.	Dan mhux daqshekk faċli.
It can’t be everything for everyone.	Ma tistax tkun kollox għal kulħadd.
I could see he thought about it	Stajt nara li ħaseb dwarha
I think you need to be here	Naħseb li għandek bżonn tkun hawn
I was all his	Jien kont kollox tiegħu
This is very difficult.	Dan huwa diffiċli ħafna.
It's really great.	Huwa tassew kbir.
I will never go back	Jien qatt mhu ser lura
Too late for us.	Tard wisq għalina.
I thought you'd be better than that	Ħsibt li int taf tkun aħjar minn hekk
And that’s not bad.	U dan mhux ħażin.
He seemed glad to talk about it.	Deher li kien ferħan jitkellem dwarha.
It was his.	Kien tiegħu.
I'm not going to hear anything more.	Jien mhu se nisma’ xi ħaġa li għandek xi tgħid aktar.
I didn’t say anything to anyone	Jien ma għedt xejn lil ħadd
I listen to this all the time	Nisma’ dan il-ħin kollu
But you know, never take it.	Imma taf, qatt ma tieħu.
It was the same one.	Kienet l-istess waħda.
I can't hear what you say anymore	Ma nistax nisma aktar xi tgħid
Just with him just before I got home	Ftit miegħu ftit qabel ma ġejt id-dar
I knew she was.	Kont naf li hi.
I’m not saying anything about it	Jien ma ngħid xejn dwarha
But you will do well.	Imma int se tagħmel tajjeb.
It probably will too.	Probabbilment se jagħmel ukoll.
I did it.	Jien għamilt dan.
And that has to be good.	U dan irid ikun tajjeb.
I know mod.	Naf mod.
It was something.	Kien xi ħaġa.
I couldn’t believe this was actually happening	Ma stajtx nemmen li dan kien qed jiġri fil-fatt
I am having a lot of problems.	Qed ikolli ħafna problemi.
It never worked.	Qatt ma kien jaħdem.
We made people better.	Għamilna nies aħjar.
Nothing too fast.	Xejn malajr wisq.
But he would not say so.	Imma ma kienx se jgħid hekk.
He doesn’t know why to think.	Ma jafx għalfejn jaħseb.
We will not be here so much.	Mhux se nkunu hawn daqshekk.
But not everyone has it easy.	Imma mhux kulħadd għandu faċli.
Maybe you can tell me.	Forsi tista’ tgħidli.
I wasn’t interested in anything	Jien ma kont interessat xejn
It's still very good.	Għadu tajjeb ħafna.
I'm a good boy.	Jien tifel tajjeb.
I wasn’t good at it at all	Jien ma kont tajjeb miegħu xejn
He was wrong.	Kellu ħażin.
He needs to survive.	Huwa jeħtieġ li jgħix.
I was supposed to be happy here	Jien suppost kelli nkun kuntent hawn
I think he is	Naħseb li hu
Surely at that time I believed.	Żgur li dak iż-żmien kont nemmen.
I have to go.	Ikolli mmur.
It couldn’t have been better.	Ma setax ikun aħjar.
He seemed to have a good time.	Deher li kellu ħin tajjeb.
More on this here.	Aktar dwar dan hawn.
This makes everyone happy.	Dan jagħmel lil kulħadd kuntent.
I think there is something wrong with me	Naħseb li hemm xi ħaġa ħażina miegħi
I definitely want that job.	Żgur li rrid dak ix-xogħol.
Good thing you don’t know.	Tajjeb li ma tkunx taf.
I can’t do this alone	Jien ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi
I would be happy to talk !.	Inkun kuntent nitkellem!.
And it comes quickly.	U ġej malajr.
Maybe tonight.	Forsi illejla.
I would love to know you are there	Inħobb inkun naf li qiegħed hemm
There was no more.	Ma kienx hemm aktar.
I thought you were still here	Ħsibt li għadek hawn
I have something here that said.	Għandi xi ħaġa hawn li qal.
I couldn't believe he could do that to me	Ma stajtx nemmen li seta’ jagħmel dan miegħi
I thought it was a pretty good way to do that.	Ħsibt li kien mod pjuttost tajjeb biex tagħmel dan.
Maybe not.	Forsi mhux.
I just want someone to come	Nixtieq biss li jiġi xi ħadd
I didn't know what was going to happen	Ma kontx naf x’kien se jiġri
I didn’t do any of that	Jien ma għamilt xejn minn dan
You came as I said.	Int ġejt kif għedt.
I’m still trying to understand that everything	Għadni qed nipprova nifhem li kollox
I wanted to talk to you too	Ridt nitkellem miegħek ukoll
It just really does	Huwa biss verament tagħmel
You don’t seem happy.	Inti ma jidhirx ferħan.
A friend loves it all the time	Ħabib iħobb il-ħin kollu
Nor were they very difficult.	Lanqas ma kienu diffiċli ħafna.
I have to tell you what it is.	Ikolli ngħidlek x'inhu.
I haven’t seen any accounts for a while	Jien ma rajt l-ebda kont għal ftit
But of course now it’s pretty hard.	Imma ovvjament issa huwa pjuttost diffiċli.
He was very happy.	Kien kuntent ħafna.
I'm as good as I can be	Jien tajjeb kemm jista' jkun
It was a very big thing	Kienet xi ħaġa kbira ħafna
I still can't believe it	Għadni ma nistax nemmen
I couldn’t believe it all happened	Ma stajtx nemmen li ġara kollox
Sometimes, it wasn’t easy.	Xi drabi, ma kienx faċli.
You'll see why.	Int ser tara għaliex.
Really good.	Tassew tajjeb.
It happened more than once.	Ġara aktar minn darba.
What ever that.	X'inhu qatt dak.
It's what they do well.	Huwa dak li jagħmlu tajjeb.
I just knew it was.	Kont naf biss li kien.
No one could do more than you did.	Ħadd ma seta’ jagħmel aktar milli għamilt int.
There were no problems, everything looked good.	Ma kienx hemm problemi, kollox deher tajjeb.
I was sure he was right	Kont ċert li kellu raġun
I have many friends	Għandi ħafna ħbieb
But he knows his job.	Imma jaf ix-xogħol tiegħu.
That was about it.	Dak kien dwar dan.
I know what to do	Naf x'se tagħmel
Come on, it won’t take long.	Ejja, ma tantx se tieħu.
That certainly wasn’t what he was expecting me to say.	Dan żgur ma kienx dak li kien jistenna li ngħid.
I went there too.	Jien mort hemm ukoll.
He went back, too.	Huwa mar lura, ukoll.
Just to be sure.	Biss biex tkun ċert.
It always seemed like I was tired lately	Dejjem deher li kont għajjien dan l-aħħar
They are just, they are just people.	Huma biss, huma biss nies.
We have to be there.	Għandna nkunu hemm.
I have many friends	Għandi ħafna ħbieb
I'm a bad friend.	Jien ħabib ħażin.
He would be sure of that.	Huwa jkun ċert minn dan.
We have a problem.	Għandna problema.
But you don’t need to come home with me.	Imma m'għandekx bżonn tiġi d-dar miegħi.
You want the truth.	Trid il-verità.
I know better than to ask	Naf aħjar milli nistaqsi
Not ready yet.	Għadu mhux lest.
I couldn’t see.	Ma stajtx nara.
You just people this.	Inti biss nies dan.
I wanted to know.	Ridt inkun naf.
Everyone who thought he was wrong.	Kulħadd li ħaseb li kien ħażin.
He didn't even look back.	Lanqas ma ħares lura.
I still can't go home	Għadni ma stajtx immur id-dar
He will always be with me.	Dejjem se jibqa’ miegħi.
It speaks nothing.	Ma titkellem xejn.
I had none and nothing	Ma kelli ħadd u xejn
I had no idea what was going to happen	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'kien se jiġri
What do you want from me?	Xi trid minni?.
I think we can do that	Naħseb li nistgħu nagħmlu dan
I can't be late either	Lanqas nista’ nieħu tard
This will not be easy.	Dan mhux se jkun faċli.
I have to sit down.	Għandi noqgħod bilqiegħda.
You weren’t there.	Inti ma kontx hemm.
But now it’s time, not so.	Imma issa wasal iż-żmien, mhux hekk.
It will be you.	Se tkun int.
I just wanted to go home now	Jien ridt biss immur id-dar issa
No one came in and no one came out.	Ħadd ma daħal u ħadd ma ħareġ.
We will never know why.	Qatt mhu se nkunu nafu għaliex.
You always have been.	Int dejjem kont.
We don't know for sure.	Ma nafu xejn żgur.
I did that last one	Għamilt dik l-aħħar waħda
People we know.	Nies li nafu.
I have no idea what they will do next	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'se jagħmlu wara
Nothing for you there.	Xejn għalik hemmhekk.
Well, she was someone we knew.	Ukoll, kienet xi ħadd li konna nafu.
Whatever you want to do.	Tkun xi tkun trid tagħmel.
I'm so glad you're here	Jien kuntent ħafna li inti hawn
He just will.	Huwa biss se.
I was worried too, but not so much about it	Jien kont inkwetat ukoll, imma mhux daqshekk dwar dan
And tomorrow we will go.	U għada se mmorru.
He lives at home.	Jgħix id-dar.
I just wanted to talk to you about something	Ridt biss nitkellem miegħek dwar xi ħaġa
He never went that far.	Hu qatt ma kien imur daqshekk.
I already know how to do it.	Diġà naf kif nagħmel dan.
I think that says it all	Naħseb li dan jgħid kollox
I would say you are right	Nixtieq ngħid li għandek raġun
And he loves it so much.	U tant iħobb ħafna.
I need someone to talk to	Għandi bżonn xi ħadd biex nitkellem
Or maybe he doesn’t think.	Jew forsi ma jaħsibx.
But by then it was too late.	Imma sa dak iż-żmien kien tard wisq.
I hadn’t thought about it that way	Ma kontx ħsibt dwarha hekk
That's what they have now.	Dak hu li għandhom issa.
Just behind that door.	Eżatt wara dak il-bieb.
It's not and you know it's not there.	Mhuwiex u taf li mhux hemm.
I believe he wanted to.	Nemmen li ried.
I know, you look like one.	Naf, inti tidher bħal waħda.
You go and take your things.	Inti tmur u tieħu l-affarijiet tiegħek.
That's not good enough.	Dak mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
I needed to know what was going on	Kelli bżonn inkun naf x’kien qed jiġri
He said it wasn't even his idea.	Qal li lanqas kienet idea tiegħu.
Quite more actually.	Pjuttost aktar fil-fatt.
Something must be wrong.	Xi ħaġa trid tkun ħażina.
It will not be easy, and it will not be quick.	Mhux se jkun faċli, u mhux se jkun malajr.
I may be ready.	I jista 'jkun lest.
I think he had enough	Naħseb li kellu biżżejjed
I need to talk to you as soon as possible	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek kemm jista' jkun malajr
I had no idea what he was doing	Ma kellix idea x’kien qed jagħmel
I hope this goes well	Nispera li dan imur tajjeb
I could see he wasn’t good enough to play.	Stajt nara li ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed biex jilgħab.
Or maybe it wasn’t.	Jew forsi ma kienx.
I should be fine now.	Għandi nkun tajjeb issa.
It is not enough to see once.	Mhuwiex biżżejjed li tara darba.
It was definitely better.	Żgur li kienet aħjar.
And neither do you.	U int lanqas.
I take your things.	Jien nieħu l-affarijiet tiegħek.
I'm so sorry to hear that	Jiddispjaċini ħafna li nisma' dan
I just need to listen	Għandi bżonn biss nisma
I’m not saying that.	Jien mhux qed ngħid hekk.
But you know, who knows.	Imma taf, min jaf.
I should not try to understand	M'għandix nipprova nifhem
And no better, either.	U mhux aktar tajjeb, lanqas.
And the next one.	U dak ta’ wara.
We have from.	Għandna minn.
I thought about things	Ħsibt dwar l-affarijiet
I also saw the same thing I saw today	Rajt ukoll l-istess ħaġa li rajt illum
That can be difficult.	Li jista 'jkun diffiċli.
Who took that.	Min ħa dak.
It looks good too.	Jidher tajjeb wisq.
I thought you would be happy	Ħsibt li inti tkun kuntent
You can't do that.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan.
But no, it actually wasn’t mine.	Imma le, fil-fatt ma kienx tiegħi.
He sees this.	Huwa jara li dan.
No one could return to him	Ħadd ma seta’ jerġa’ lura għandu
Someone was there.	Xi ħadd kien hemm.
And maybe he is.	U forsi hu.
You are not ready yet.	Għadek m'intix lest.
I won't talk to you anymore	Jien mhux se nitkellem miegħek aktar
There was never a man.	Qatt ma kien hemm raġel.
They seem to have.	Jidher li għandhom .
I’m willing to take on everything	Jien lest li nieħu fuq kollox
That was too much for him tonight.	Dan kien wisq għalih illejla.
But not just one.	Imma mhux wieħed biss.
I was sure it wouldn’t work	Jien kont ċert li mhux se jaħdem
I can't be anymore	Ma nistax inkun aktar
I didn’t need more than that	Ma kellix bżonn aktar minn hekk
She didn't know.	Hija ma kinitx taf.
There is something you should know as well.	Hemm xi ħaġa li għandek tkun taf ukoll.
It was, like.	Kien, bħal.
That would be good.	Dak ikun tajjeb.
I've gone.	Jien stajt immur.
I need you to stay here	Għandi bżonn li toqgħod hawn
What am I doing wrong? 	X'qed nagħmel ħażin?
I knew she was tired	Kont naf li kienet għajjien
I look forward to hearing from you	Noqgħod nistenna biex nisma’ fejn sejjer dan
It has always been so.	Dejjem kien hekk.
This cannot be so.	Dan ma jistax ikun hekk.
I know that's not what you want to do	Naf li mhux dak li tixtieq tagħmel
I couldn't speak	Ma stajtx nitkellem
We have to be better than that.	Għandna nkunu aħjar minn hekk.
For me that was not a problem.	Għalija dik ma kinitx problema.
I think he wants to know about it all	Naħseb li jrid ikun jaf dwar dan kollu
She had little time.	Ma tantx kellha ħin.
To sit down.	Biex toqgħod bilqiegħda.
But this is not enough.	Imma dan mhux biżżejjed.
And very, very fast.	U ħafna, ħafna malajr.
I have to wait a little longer	Għandi nistenna għal ftit aktar ħin
I never knew what to say	Qatt ma kont naf x’se ngħid
She was just a boy.	Kienet biss tifel.
She was not home.	Hija ma kinitx id-dar.
I was never happy	Qatt ma kont kuntent
What we are doing is pretty big.	Dak li qed nagħmlu huwa pjuttost kbir.
This he was doing.	Dan kien qed jagħmel.
You won't, you know.	Inti mhux se, taf.
I want to go with you	Irrid immur miegħek
We both have.	It-tnejn għandna.
I thought about it	Ħsibt dwar dan
I couldn't speak.	Ma stajtx nitkellem.
I asked him.	I talab miegħu.
I sat down, too.	I poġġa bilqiegħda, ukoll.
And for me it’s work.	U għalija huwa xogħol.
Everyone is easy.	Kulħadd huwa faċli.
It's just that.	Huwa biss dan.
I knew he felt bad enough as he was	Kont naf li ħassu ħażin biżżejjed kif kien
I have so much fun.	Jien nieħu gost hekk.
I couldn’t say so.	Jien ma stajtx ngħid hekk.
He doesn’t know where he is.	Ma jafx fejn hu.
I know who you think looks good	Naf min taħseb li jidher tajjeb
Let me say this.	Ħa ngħid dan.
For him, this was obviously not a big deal.	Għalih, dan ovvjament ma kienx xi ħaġa kbira.
Good to know.	Tajjeb li tkun taf.
I needed to go back	Kelli bżonn nerġa’ lura
I did, but that wasn’t enough.	Għamilt, imma dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
Or he thought he had.	Jew ħaseb li kellu.
I'm worried about that.	Jien inkwetat dwar dan.
I really want to go back	Nixtieq verament nerġa' lura
I know they were your friends	Naf li kienu ħbieb tiegħek
When he did.	Meta għamel.
He was ready for it.	Kien lest għal dan.
I can't see anything	Ma nista’ nara xejn
Well, actually.	Ukoll, fil-fatt.
This definitely made my week.	Dan żgur għamel il-ġimgħa tiegħi.
He needed time alone.	Huwa kellu bżonn il-ħin waħdu.
But he certainly is.	Imma żgur li hu.
But not really.	Imma mhux verament.
You know just like everyone else.	Int taf hekk kif kulħadd.
Here to eat well !.	Hawn biex tiekol tajjeb!.
I know what you really are	Naf dak li int verament
Some time ago.	Xi żmien ilu.
You can both have fun doing this with each other.	It-tnejn inti tista 'tieħu gost tagħmel dan ma' xulxin.
I have both.	Għandi t-tnejn.
I thought that was all he was going to take.	Ħsibt li dak kollu li kien se jieħu.
Or was it.	Jew kien.
Obviously no one is going to do that.	Ovvjament ħadd mhu se jagħmel dan.
Maybe you've heard of it.	Forsi smajt dwar dan.
I just couldn’t believe it	I biss ma stajtx nemmen dan
I didn’t want to think about it.	Ma ridtx naħseb dwarha.
But we won't know for a while.	Imma mhux se nkunu nafu għal xi żmien.
There should be no such things.	M'għandux ikun hemm affarijiet bħal dawn.
I go first.	Immur l-ewwel.
I try not to think much about it	Nipprova ma naħsibx ħafna dwarha
Look at nothing.	Ħares lejn xejn.
I didn't know what he was doing	Ma kontx naf x’kien qed jagħmel
I would like you to come to me with this.	Nixtieq li tiġi għandi b'dan.
Maybe she did.	Forsi hi għamlet.
She really seemed to be here with me.	Verament deher li kienet hawn miegħi.
There he is. 	Hemm hu. 
That's it.	Li dan hu.
He looked like any other child.	Huwa deher bħal kull tifel ieħor.
Everyone says so.	Kulħadd jgħid hekk.
I’m the only one out there who doesn’t enjoy it	Jien l-uniku wieħed hemmhekk li ma nieħu gost
Being alone is good.	Li tkun waħdu tajjeb.
You have to go.	Trid tmur.
It will come.	Se jiġi.
Maybe not today.	Forsi mhux illum.
Maybe no one is there.	Forsi ħadd mhu hemm.
I was worried for nothing	Jien kont inkwetat għal xejn
But it is happening.	Imma qed jiġri.
Something can happen.	Jista' jiġri xi ħaġa.
No one knew.	Ħadd ma kien ikun jaf.
I didn’t know that either	Jien ma kontx naf li lanqas
Just going like that.	Biss sejjer hekk.
But it was not good.	Imma ma kienx tajjeb.
I don’t like things too easy.	Ma nħobbx affarijiet faċli wisq.
You will not be late.	Inti mhux se tkun tard.
I'm a bad person.	Jien persuna ħażina.
I wasn’t too worried	Ma kontx inkwetat wisq
But that will have to wait.	Imma dak se jkollu jistenna.
Well, the time is.	Ukoll, iż-żmien huwa.
No, it's not.	Le, mhuwiex.
I'm afraid you're right	Jien nibża li għandek raġun
That’s really what we do.	Dak huwa verament dak li nagħmlu.
I needed the job.	Jien kelli bżonn ix-xogħol.
And you can see why	U wieħed jista’ jara għaliex
I wasn’t good enough	Ma kontx tajjeb biżżejjed
I wasn't even there	Lanqas kont inkun hemm
He was such a great man.	Kien raġel daqshekk kbir.
I think you know where this is going	Naħseb li taf fejn sejjer dan
When he went back to.	Meta mar lura lejn .
I will not do this tonight	Mhux se nagħmel dan illejla
I'm always the same	Jien dejjem l-istess
And it’s great.	U huwa kbir.
It’s just not who I am.	Huwa biss mhux min jien.
It will not do that.	Mhux se tagħmel dan.
There was nothing he could do.	Ma seta’ jagħmel xejn.
I didn’t want that	Jien ma ridtx hekk
I can't tell you how	Ma nistax ngħidlek kif
I know how you think	Naf kif taħseb
And this is what they do.	U dan huwa dak li jagħmlu.
He will be.	Hu se jkun.
That was so.	Dak kien hekk.
They do what is needed.	Huma jagħmlu dak li hemm bżonn.
I can't do anything right	Ma nista nagħmel xejn tajjeb
I know of course it won't happen	Naf ovvjament li mhux se jiġri
You want to know that.	Trid tkun taf dan.
I can't be sure of that	Ma nistax inkun ċert minn dan
I don't have time for that	M'għandix ħin għal dan
I just came to tell you what happened.	Ġejt biss biex ngħidlek x’ġara.
There is no help.	M'hemm l-ebda għajnuna.
But he would not.	Imma ma kienx se.
But it was too late.	Imma kienu tard wisq.
I can't wait to do it again!	Ma nistax nistenna li nerġa' nagħmel!
It’s hard to know what really happened.	Huwa diffiċli li tkun taf x'ġara verament.
It’s time, he thought.	Wasal iż-żmien, ħaseb.
It happens to more people than you think.	Jiġri u lil aktar nies milli taħseb.
He was another great man.	Kien raġel ieħor kbir.
But nothing was done.	Imma xejn ma sar.
I have not.	Għandi le.
It’s all you know.	Huwa dak kollu li taf.
I will be here, waiting and listening.	Jien inkun hawn, nistenna u nisma’.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
I’ve done the same, or not	Jien stajt għamilt l-istess, jew le
This is it.	Dan hu.
You can do what works for you.	Tista 'tagħmel dak li jaħdem għalik.
It takes a while for everyone.	Huwa jieħu ftit żmien għal kulħadd.
Unless, of course, that someone isn’t you.	Sakemm, ovvjament, dak xi ħadd ma tkunx int.
There is nothing more for you than that.	M'hemm xejn aktar għalik minn hekk.
It was easy to see outside.	Kien faċli biex tara barra.
Me, but this is very difficult	Jien, imma dan huwa diffiċli ħafna
I don’t want to talk to him anymore.	Ma rridx li titkellem miegħu aktar.
I think we will	Naħseb li aħna se
We can do as much as you want or as much as you want.	Nistgħu nagħmlu kemm trid jew kemm trid.
But not entirely right.	Imma mhux għal kollox raġun.
If he knew more, he wasn’t saying.	Jekk kien jaf aktar, ma kienx qed jgħid.
That’s not what we do.	Dak mhux dak li nagħmlu.
I did it without telling anyone	Għamilt mingħajr ma għedt lil ħadd
There are a few.	Hemm ftit.
But not too long.	Imma mhux twil wisq.
I take each one in turn.	Jien nieħu kull wieħed wara xulxin.
I need to be alone for a while	Għandi bżonn inkun waħdi għal xi żmien
It was hard to tell.	Kien diffiċli li tgħid.
I’m still nothing but good	Jien għadni xejn imma tajjeb
You weren't happy with me or anyone else.	Inti ma kontx kuntent miegħi jew xi ħadd ieħor.
I’ve been sitting here for a while now.	Ilni bilqiegħda hawn għal xi żmien issa.
Hard to say.	Diffiċli ngħid.
We have something for everyone.	Għandna xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
Eating together is always better.	Li tiekol flimkien huwa dejjem aħjar.
There is nothing there for a long time.	M'hemm xejn hemm għal żmien twil.
I didn’t have a job where to go	Ma kellix xogħol fejn immur
This will take.	Dan se jieħu.
And it is working.	U qiegħed jaħdem.
We are friends now.	Aħna ħbieb issa.
I could tell she was doing something	Stajt ngħid li kienet tagħmel xi ħaġa
I knew exactly what was going on	Kont naf eżatt x’kien qed jiġri
I couldn’t do that.	Jien ma stajtx nagħmel dan.
But he was just as bad as everyone else.	Imma kien ħażin daqs kulħadd.
You can say whatever you want.	Tista’ tgħid li trid.
I needed time alone	Jien kelli bżonn il-ħin waħdi
I knew they were here	Kont naf li kienu hawn
But it was never the same.	Imma qatt ma kienet l-istess.
But more than that she wasn’t going.	Imma aktar minn hekk ma kinitx tmur.
I didn’t know anyone	Jien ma kont naf lil ħadd
He didn't have to talk.	Ma kellux għalfejn jitkellem.
I knew who it was	Kont naf ta’ min kien ta’ min
I can say something	Nista’ ngħid xi ħaġa
I had to tell you	Kelli ngħidlek
I’m not just saying that	Jien mhux biss ngħid dan
It can’t be that hard.	Ma jistax ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
I will never do this again, you know that	Qatt ma nagħmel dan mill-ġdid, inti taf li
For that may be.	Għal li jista 'jkun.
Easy to do.	Faċli tagħmel dan.
I was as bad as I could be	Kont ħażin kemm jista’ jkun
Which is not easy.	Li mhux faċli.
He just came out.	Huwa biss ħareġ.
I think there could be more than that.	Naħseb li jista' jkun hemm aktar minn hekk.
I thought about it, too.	Ħsibt dwar dan, ukoll.
I will never do that again.	Qatt mhu se nerġa’ nagħmel dan.
I didn’t eat anymore	Ma kontx niekol aktar
I want to hear more about this	Irrid nisma aktar dwar dan
You have no idea what is going on.	M'għandekx idea x'qed jiġri.
I had nowhere to go	Ma kellix fejn immur
I want to go now.	Irrid immur issa.
I want everything to be good again	Irrid li kollox jerġa’ jkun tajjeb
I am so happy now.	Jiena tant kuntent issa.
He will come.	Hu se jiġi.
That's one thing.	Dik hija ħaġa waħda.
That was good for me.	Dak kien tajjeb għalija.
We want to do something about it.	Irridu nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwarha.
But you need to.	Imma għandek bżonn.
There needs to be more people.	Jeħtieġ li jkun hemm aktar nies.
All this.	Dan kollu.
I couldn’t see where any of this was going	Ma stajtx nara fejn kien sejjer xi ħaġa minn dan
She had to sit down.	Kellha toqgħod bilqiegħda.
I'm just happy.	Jien kuntent biss.
I didn't want to hear it	Ma ridtx nisma
I couldn’t tell how many there were	Ma stajtx ngħid kemm kien hemm
I still haven't been able to eat	Għadni ma stajtx niekol
I didn't know what it was	Ma kontx naf x’kien
But be the first.	Imma tkun l-ewwel.
And it's hard.	U huwa diffiċli.
I can see that well	Jien nista' nara tajjeb ma' dak
For me this was great	Għalija dan kien kbir
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
I was tired, so very, very tired	Kont għajjien, hekk ħafna, ħafna għajjien
You can make a lot of money there.	Tista 'tagħmel ħafna flus hemmhekk.
There was no other work.	Ma kienx hemm xogħol ieħor.
That's not a bit.	Dak mhux daqsxejn.
I hope you are doing well	Nittama li inti sejjer tajjeb
I can already do that	Diġà nista' nagħmel dan
I can’t do that anymore	Ma nistax nagħmel dan aktar
He was happy with that.	Kien kuntent b’dan.
I want to know that it will be good	Irrid inkun naf li se jkun tajjeb
I may be home late	Nista’ nkun id-dar tard
You can do it here, now.	Tista 'tagħmel dan hawn, issa.
He is gone forever.	Huwa mar għal dejjem.
This is not the only problem you have.	Din mhix l-unika problema li għandek.
I was not a good friend to you	Ma kontx ħabib tajjeb għalik
It looks great.	Jidher ħafna.
I think it’s on to something.	Naħseb li qiegħed fuq xi ħaġa.
I was sure there was no more	Kont ċert li ma kienx hemm aktar
But he was here.	Imma kien hawn.
She didn't have to come here.	Hija ma kellha tiġi hawn.
She was not seen.	Hija ma kinitx tidher.
I can't hear what he's saying	Ma nistax nisma' x'qed jgħid
Not very long.	Lanqas twil ħafna.
I know how bad that car was	Naf kemm kienet ħażina dik il-karozza
I didn’t even want to think about it	Lanqas ridt naħseb dwarha
But that is what we do.	Imma dan huwa dak li nagħmlu.
I will understand this soon enough.	Dan se nifhem malajr biżżejjed.
It would be a lot easier.	Ikun ħafna aktar faċli.
I can't even speak.	Lanqas nista’ nitkellem.
It was quite so.	Kien pjuttost hekk.
I knew this was not going to work out	Kont naf li dan mhux se jmur tajjeb
This was not to work.	Dan ma kellux jaħdem hekk.
I like to think it will.	Nixtieq naħseb li se.
I haven't been there in a long time	Ilni ma kont hemm
Or there it was.	Jew kien hemm.
Help will come.	L-għajnuna se tiġi.
The only thing was, it was a big size.	L-unika ħaġa kienet, kienet li kien daqs kbir.
Well, she wasn't.	Ukoll, hi ma kinitx.
Maybe we do.	Forsi nagħmlu.
I loved it.	Kont inħobb.
I should have known better than that.	I kellha naf aħjar minn hekk.
Hard from where to be to be sure.	Diffiċli minn fejn jinsab biex tkun ċert.
I wanted to ask again	Ridt nistaqsi mill-ġdid
Well, very well, actually.	Ukoll, tajjeb ħafna, fil-fatt.
I couldn't hear much of what he was saying	Ma stajtx nisma’ ħafna minn dak li kien qed jgħid
He didn’t want to go, and so it was.	Ma riedx imur, u hekk kien.
It was mine now.	Kien tiegħi issa.
That’s the only way he plays.	Dak hu l-uniku mod kif jilgħab.
He will never return.	Hu qatt ma se lura.
That is for sure.	Dan huwa żgur.
You either want it or not.	Int jew trid jew le.
I’m not here to make friends	Jien mhux hawn biex nagħmel ħbieb
I want to hear everything	Irrid nisma’ kollox
Now they have to.	Issa għandhom.
I don’t want to believe anything.	Ma rrid nemmen xejn.
I would be all yours	Inkun kollu tiegħek
That’s who you are here.	Dak hu li int hawn.
You can be a teacher.	Tista’ tkun għalliem.
There are too many.	Hemm wisq.
The same one.	L-istess waħda.
I need you to be there for me	Għandi bżonn li tkun hemm għalija
I don't know for sure.	Ma nafx x’inhu dwarha żgur.
It wasn’t so bad.	Ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
And we know that.	U nafu dan.
I couldn't tell what it was.	Ma stajtx tgħid x’kien.
He could not sit down.	Ma setax joqgħod bilqiegħda.
This is my job.	Dan huwa xogħol tiegħi.
She is not supposed to do that.	Hija mhux suppost tagħmel dan.
It's been too long	Diġà ilni wisq
We were going, but.	Konna se, imma.
Almost never actually.	Kważi qatt fil-fatt.
I believe what I said	Nemmen li dak li għidt
He needed to think about it.	Kellu bżonn jaħseb dwarha.
Well, why.	Ukoll, għaliex.
I can't talk to anyone about it	Ma nista’ nitkellem ma’ ħadd dwarha
Here you are.	Hawn int.
I need to know what's going on	Għandi bżonn inkun naf x'inhu jiġri
And tell the truth.	U għid il-verità.
First for him too	L-ewwel għalih ukoll
I’ve never seen anything like that	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal dik
You said it was happening before, and it wasn’t.	Inti għedt li kien qed jiġri qabel, u ma kienx.
I never wanted to know.	Qatt ma ridt inkun naf.
I belonged to someone else.	Jien kont ta’ xi ħadd ieħor.
I know there is nothing better	Naf li m'hemm xejn aħjar
i needed.	kelli bżonn.
I hadn’t thought about it before	Ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan qabel
You must be ready by then.	Trid tkun lest dak iż-żmien.
I love the work I did	Inħobb ix-xogħol li għamilt
I believe so too.	Jien nemmen hekk ukoll.
Nothing is just what it is.	Xejn huwa biss dak li hu.
I see a lot of the latter	Ta’ l-aħħar nara ħafna
I see no other.	ma nara l-ebda oħra.
I hope everything goes well.	Nittama li kollox imur tajjeb.
I think from there it was	Naħseb li minn hemm kienet
I'm not busy.	Jien mhux okkupat.
It's hard to go.	Huwa diffiċli li tmur.
Never, ever again.	Qatt, qatt aktar.
I didn’t want to talk to him either	Ma ridtx nitkellem miegħu lanqas
He must be.	Huwa għandu jiġi.
Everything in the room was great.	Kollox fil-kamra kien kbir.
She was saying a lot of things.	Kienet tgħid ħafna affarijiet.
I like to be surprised.	Inħobb inkun sorpriż.
I knew I was coming	Kont naf li ġejt
I can’t be sure.	Ma nistax inkun ċert.
I knew there was something	Kont naf li kien hemm xi ħaġa
But we are nothing.	Imma aħna xejn.
I didn’t think they would do that.	Ma kontx naħseb li se jagħmlu dan.
Never do that.	Qatt ma tagħmel hekk.
Maybe if we.	Forsi jekk aħna.
I see no problem with that	Ma nara l-ebda problema b’dan
I don't know myself.	Jien ma nafx jien.
I can't believe you think so	Ma nistax nemmen li int taħseb hekk
I know he will do it, sooner or later	Naf li se tagħmel dan, illum jew għada
That wasn’t too good either.	Dik lanqas ma kienet tajba wisq.
I expect that.	Nistenna li.
This is what they do.	Dan huwa dak li jagħmlu.
I just can’t take that	Jien biss ma nistax nieħu dan
I wasn't sure.	Ma kontx ċert.
I think we have something good for you here	Naħseb li għandna xi ħaġa tajba għalik hawn
And now we know what it looks like.	U issa nafu dak li jidher.
We both knew each other better.	It-tnejn konna nafu aħjar.
They are too much to say.	Huma wisq biex tgħid.
You have three hours.	Għandek tliet sigħat.
He also died.	Miet ukoll.
I would like to know where you are now	Nixtieq inkun naf fejn qiegħed issa
I couldn’t do it alone.	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan waħdi.
I think I'll be back soon.	Naħseb li kollox jerġa’ lura għandi malajr.
I'm sorry now.	Jiddispjaċini li issa.
Just enough again.	Ftit biżżejjed mill-ġdid.
I don't need anyone	M'għandi bżonn lil ħadd
And he did.	U għamel hekk.
I can’t be the only one who knows	Ma nistax inkun l-uniku wieħed li jaf
I was doing too much.	Jien kont nagħmel wisq.
Nothing else works.	Xejn aktar ma jaħdem.
I was glad.	Kont ferħan.
Good to know why.	Tajjeb li tkun taf għaliex.
That was the only way.	Dan kien l-uniku mod.
She says she doesn’t.	Tgħid li ma tagħmilx hekk.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx.
Had she had more time to think.	Kieku kellha aktar ħin biex taħseb.
I really want to be that	Verament irrid inkun dak
I love everyone at home	Inħobb lil kulħadd id-dar
I wanted to tell you yesterday	Ridt ngħidlek ilbieraħ
Which, of course, is not.	Li, ovvjament, mhuwiex.
He doesn’t want one.	Ma jridx wieħed.
I’m not much better	Jien m'iniex ħafna aħjar
I'm not very ready.	Jien ma tantx lest.
No, that may not be right.	Le, dan ma jistax ikun tajjeb.
It was a difficult time for everyone.	Kien żmien diffiċli għal kulħadd.
I live here.	Jien noqgħod hawn.
I want this house to be yours and mine	Irrid li din id-dar tkun tiegħek u tiegħi
I can't wait !.	Ma nistax nistenna!.
I have something for you too.	Għandi xi ħaġa għalik ukoll.
I have to wait a bit	Irrid nistenna ftit
For what they were doing.	Għal dak li kienu qed jagħmlu.
As soon as possible.	Kemm jista' jkun malajr.
I can tell you that.	Nista’ ngħidlek dan.
You have to go.	Trid tmur.
I could understand that	Jien stajt nifhem dan
,.	, .
I was scared	Kont qed nibża’
But that’s not what’s happening.	Imma mhux dak li qed jiġri.
I have nothing wrong with that	M'għandi xejn ħażin xi ngħid dwar dan
All right so far.	Kollox tajjeb sa hawn.
I can't do that myself	Ma nistax nagħmel dan jien
I've never heard of it before	Jien lanqas qatt ma smajt b’dan
He thought it was pretty good.	Huwa ħaseb li kien pjuttost tajjeb.
I can’t do that anymore	Ma nistax nagħmel dan aktar
They were just things.	Kienu biss affarijiet.
And apparently it never will.	U milli jidher qatt mhu se.
This will help.	Dan se jgħin.
It wasn’t too hard.	Ma kienx wisq diffiċli.
He has to, he really has to.	Huwa għandu, hu verament għandu.
I don’t know why this is happening	Ma nafx għalfejn qed jiġri dan
I still believe that	Għadni nemmen li
There are many problems.	Hemm ħafna problemi.
I'm always with you	Jien dejjem miegħek
I had one last thing to say	Kelli l-aħħar ħaġa xi ngħid
I can't believe you didn't	Ma nistax nemmen li inti ma
I wasn’t sure why.	Ma kienx ċert għaliex.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Aħjar minn ftit wisq.
I want to hear what he has to say.	Irrid nisma’ x’għandu xi jgħid.
I have other things for you.	Għandi affarijiet oħra għalik.
I can't do it myself	Ma nistax nagħmel jien
I know it’s time	Naf li wasal iż-żmien
I think everyone did well tonight	Naħseb li kulħadd mar tajjeb illejla
He knew he would only take one more chance.	Kien jaf li kien se jieħu biss ċans wieħed ieħor.
I never wanted anyone like that	Qatt ma ridt lil ħadd bħal dan
But not everything.	Imma mhux kull ħaġa.
There he is.	Hemm hu.
It couldn’t be happening now.	Ma setax ikun qed jiġri issa.
I can do whatever it takes	Kapaċi nagħmel dak kollu li hemm bżonn
I had no idea what you were saying.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'qed tgħid.
That could be me.	Dan jista 'jkun jien.
I don’t believe that either.	Jien ma nemmen li lanqas.
Time to tell the truth.	Żmien li tgħid il-verità.
But that's good.	Imma dak tajjeb.
I think there are too many.	Naħseb li hemm wisq.
It should not.	M'għandux.
I only need this week	Għandi bżonn biss din il-ġimgħa
I want us to be together now	Irrid li nkunu flimkien issa
Some time later.	Xi żmien wara.
I know, I was doing better	Naf, kont tagħmel aħjar
He should be scared.	Għandu jibża.
That’s likely to do it.	Dak huwa probabbli li tagħmel dan.
But now you’re something else.	Imma issa int xi ħaġa oħra.
It seems like I can't think of anything else	Jidher li ma nistax naħseb fuq xi ħaġa oħra
He said that was the only thing he could think of to say.	Huwa qal li l-unika ħaġa li seta' jaħseb biex jgħid.
I can see.	nista' nara.
He was no more certain than anything.	Ma kien aktar ċert minn xejn.
I had to do that too	Kelli nagħmel dan ukoll
I want you to be happy.	Irrid li tkun kuntent.
It was too much, too fast.	Kien wisq, malajr wisq.
I see too well what it is	Nara wisq tajjeb x’inhu
I’m sure this should work for you.	Jien ċert li dan għandu jaħdem għalik.
He will be fine.	Hu se jkun tajjeb.
That was going to be.	Dak kien se jkun.
He didn't know what was going on.	Ma kienx jaf x’kien qed jiġri.
I just went back.	I biss mort lura.
I didn’t know anything better	Ma kont naf xejn aħjar
So much had happened.	Tant kien ġara.
I was sure, it was someone else	Kont ċert, kien xi ħadd ieħor
Nobody ever told me that.	Ħadd qatt qalli dan.
There is more here.	Hemm aktar hawn.
I know there is more	Naf li hemm aktar
He is a really beautiful person.	Huwa persuna tassew sabiħa.
Only he can.	Li jista’ jkun hu biss.
Not from me.	Mhux minni.
I would be fine on my own	Jien inkun tajjeb waħdi
I heard I was home	Smajt li kont id-dar
Not too bad.	Mhux ħażin wisq.
It's just that something.	Huwa biss li xi ħaġa.
It can't be that way.	Ma jistax ikun hekk.
I know what you want to do	Naf xi trid tagħmel
I think every child should	Naħseb li kull tifel għandu
It seems like everything is working.	Jidher li kollox qed jaħdem.
But someday it will.	Imma xi darba se.
This is so easy.	Dan huwa daqshekk faċli.
It’s the same for me.	Huwa l-istess għalija.
I saw that this was going to be the way it was	Rajt li dan kien se jkun kif kien
I want to hear from everyone and everyone.	Nixtieq nisma' minn kulħadd u minn kulħadd.
I didn’t know how good it would be.	Ma kontx naf kemm tkun tajjeb.
I must always tell the truth	Għandi dejjem ngħid il-verità
To be a teacher.	Li tkun għalliem.
It's too much.	Sar wisq.
Not just me, but you.	Mhux jien biss, imma int.
He thought it was all over now.	Huwa ħaseb li kien kollox fuq issa.
I believe he will do a good job	Nemmen li se jagħmel xogħol tajjeb
Not last night.	Mhux ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
He never had a chance.	Hu qatt ma kellu ċans.
I didn't have time for anything	Ma kelli ħin għal xejn
I want to believe that he died that way.	Irrid nemmen li hekk miet.
I knew this was coming.	Kont naf li dan kien ġej.
I was going to tell you the same thing	Kont se ngħidlek l-istess ħaġa
Well, too bad.	Ukoll, ħażin wisq.
You are not supposed to do that.	M'intix suppost tagħmel dan.
He will try.	Huwa ser jipprova.
I still don't know.	Għadni ma nafx.
I know it was.	Naf li kien.
But not with this one.	Imma mhux b'dan wieħed.
It goes again.	Imur mill-ġdid.
I'm at a friend's house.	Jien id-dar ta’ ħabib.
He would never have taken a better one.	Hu qatt ma kien jieħu wieħed aħjar.
I was there too.	Jien kont hemm ukoll.
I thought I saw the following	Ħsibt li ra li ġej
I can't think.	Ma nistax naħseb.
I never wanted to do that	Qatt ma ridt nagħmel hekk
No one wants to talk about it.	Ħadd ma jrid jitkellem dwarha.
He can’t do both.	Ma jistax jagħmel it-tnejn.
He had said this.	Huwa kien qal dan.
I wanted too much	Ridt wisq
He went for me.	Huwa mar għalija.
A man was there.	Raġel kien hemm.
But it looked good.	Imma deher tajjeb.
You.	Inti.
If you want.	Jekk trid.
I went to my door and listened to him	Mort lejn il-bieb tiegħi u smajt għalih
It was early in the morning.	Kien kmieni filgħodu.
Anything you want.	Kull ħaġa li trid.
I just couldn't tell.	I biss ma stajtx tgħid.
I only did this last night	Dan għamilt biss ilbieraħ filgħaxija
I just wanted to see how they felt	Ridt biss nara kif ħassu
It's the same.	Huwa l-istess.
I really do, you know.	Jien tassew, taf.
I think you just said that	Naħseb li għadek kif għedt hekk
I don’t know how it happened	Ma nafx kif ġara
I’m the same yesterday, today, and forever	Jien l-istess ilbieraħ, illum, u għal dejjem
Now you see.	Issa tara.
I know this is hard for you.	Naf li dan huwa diffiċli għalik.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx.
I think he had.	Naħseb li kellu.
I said nothing more	Jien ma għedt xejn aktar
I never was.	Qatt ma kont.
They do so.	Hekk jagħmlu.
None of these will be a problem.	Xejn minn dawn mhu se jkun problema.
There will never be.	Qatt ma jkun hemm.
It is who and what we are.	Huwa min u dak li aħna.
It's after that.	Huwa wara dan.
I hope this works.	Nittama li dan jaħdem.
I was worried about it.	Kont inkwetat dwarha.
This works well as well.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb ukoll.
You can too.	Inti tista 'ukoll.
I didn’t say anything to anyone	Jien ma għedt xejn lil ħadd
In fact, they were.	Fil-fatt, kienu.
I didn’t know exactly how they were	Ma kontx naf eżatt kif kienu
Not where we are.	Mhux fejn aħna.
But they were there now.	Imma kienu hemm issa.
He was still waiting.	Kien għadu qed jistenna.
i take things.	nieħu l-affarijiet.
He said he didn’t know.	Qal li ma kienx jaf.
I love everyone.	Inħobb lil kulħadd.
First, as to what they are.	L-ewwel, kif dak li huma.
I should probably go home	Probabbilment għandi mmur id-dar
So easy.	Faċli daqshekk.
It may be enough.	Jista 'jkun biżżejjed.
I never saw the things he did	Qatt ma rajt l-affarijiet li għamel
I have no idea who he was	M'għandi l-ebda idea ta' min kien
I just thought he should know	Ħsibt biss li għandu jkun jaf
I'll try again	Jien nerġa' nipprova
I can do a little more	Nista' nagħmel ftit aktar
This will really help.	Dan se jgħin tassew.
He seemed happy too.	Deher kuntent ukoll.
I think so.	Naħseb dan.
He couldn't do anything right.	Ma seta’ jagħmel xejn tajjeb.
I expect him to say something	Nistenna li jgħid xi ħaġa
You will be fine, he says.	Int se tkun tajjeb, jgħid.
You know just like everyone else.	Int taf hekk kif kulħadd.
Maybe there was someone.	Forsi kien hemm xi ħadd.
I couldn't see how it looked	Ma stajtx nara kif deher
I believe he wanted to come back.	Nemmen li ried jiġi lura.
He would never say whether it was good or bad.	Qatt ma kien jgħid jekk kienx tajjeb jew ħażin.
It had just come out.	Kien għadu kemm ħareġ.
He may be better than me.	Jista’ jkun li jkun aħjar minni.
I haven't thought about it in years	Ilni snin ma naħseb dwarha
I've never been on one before	Qatt ma kont fuq waħda qabel
Like, much more.	Bħal, ħafna aktar.
And maybe that’s a good thing.	U forsi dik hija ħaġa tajba.
And he would have done so.	U kien ikun u hekk jagħmel.
Everyone knew each other.	Kulħadd kien jaf lil xulxin.
Out of nowhere.	Minn xejn.
As of now, it can’t be done.	Minn issa, ma jistax isir.
Not a single person there	Mhux persuna waħda hemmhekk
I wasn’t sure what to expect	Ma kontx ċert x'se nistenna
I wanted to know what he was doing	Ridt inkun naf x’kien qed jagħmel
I couldn’t think of more than that	Ma stajtx naħseb aktar minn hekk
I was probably doing the same thing	Probabbilment kont nagħmel l-istess ħaġa
I hope he never does	Nispera li qatt ma jagħmel
I truly believe that	Jien tassew nemmen li
It almost was.	Kienet kważi kienet.
I can't believe you	Ma nistax nemmen li int
But it is the only one we have.	Imma hija l-unika waħda li għandna.
Probably a long time.	Probabbilment żmien twil.
First time for him.	L-ewwel darba għalih.
I want you to be happy for us	Irrid li tkun ferħan għalina
This is not happening.	Dan mhux qed jiġri.
Nothing easy about it.	Xejn faċli dwarha.
She can't see, of course.	Hi ma tistax tara, ovvjament.
I am enjoying our time together	Qed nieħu gost il-ħin tagħna flimkien
I know he wants to play	Naf li jrid jilgħab
I should probably go	Probabbilment għandi mmur
I had never told anyone like that before	Qatt ma kont għedt lil xi ħadd hekk qabel
You know how bad things get when you're young.	Taf kemm wieħed jieħu ħażin l-affarijiet meta jkun żgħir.
I did a good job with this	Għamilt xogħol tajjeb ma' dan
You did what I could.	Int għamilt dak li stajt.
I have to wonder how she did that	Irrid nistaqsi kif għamlet dan
I had no idea it was so	Ma kellix idea li kien hekk
Back here.	Lura hawn.
I thought there would be a time	Ħsibt li jkun hemm żmien
That's too easy.	Dak faċli wisq.
I wasn't ready to listen	Ma kontx lest nisma’
This never happened.	Dan qatt ma ġara.
I’m nobody to talk about it	Jiena ħadd biex nitkellem dwarha
It’s always work being done.	Huwa dejjem xogħol li qed isir.
Well, so was she.	Ukoll, hekk kienet hi.
I want to talk to you	Irrid nitkellem miegħek
He didn’t say so.	Ma kienx jgħid hekk.
No one knew how he got there.	Ħadd ma kien jaf kif wasal hemm.
I hadn’t thought about it before	Ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan qabel
I wish there was something we could do	Nixtieq li jkun hemm xi ħaġa li nistgħu nagħmlu
I was right about everything	Kelli raġun dwar kollox
So it happened to me.	Hekk ġara miegħi.
A person sees all things as they really are	Persuna tara l-affarijiet kollha kif verament huma
But for us, it's too good a thing.	Imma għalina, hija wisq ħaġa tajba.
I wasn’t sure if it was ready	Ma kontx ċert jekk kienx lest
I love it there	Inħobb hemmhekk
He was not doing so.	Kien ma jagħmilx hekk.
I did a lot of bad things.	Għamilt ħafna affarijiet ħażin.
She can do this for hours.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan għal sigħat.
I just thought you should know, everything	Ħsibt biss li għandek tkun taf, dak kollu
You can do that, you know.	Tista' tagħmel dan, taf.
But he thought it might help.	Imma ħaseb li jista 'jgħin.
I had to do this a long time ago	I kellha tagħmel dan twil ilu
It's both.	Huwa t-tnejn.
He is right about that.	Huwa għandu raġun dwar dan.
I’m really sorry it has to be that way.	Jiena tassew jiddispjaċini li jrid ikun hekk.
I did as much as anyone could	Għamilt kemm seta’ jagħmel xi ħadd
All this time.	Dan iż-żmien kollu.
Why? 	Għaliex?
I need to think about it.	Għandi bżonn naħseb dwar dan.
I don’t do much here.	Jien ma nagħmel ħafna hawn.
That’s all he needs.	Dan huwa dak kollu li għandu bżonn.
You have no idea what's going on.	M'għandekx idea li qed jiġri.
And it must be so	U trid tkun hekk
What will appear.	Dak li se tidher.
I enjoy talking to you	Nieħu gost nitkellem miegħek
Or it should be.	Jew għandu jkun.
I saw everything happen	Rajt kollox jiġri
He couldn't see much.	Ma setax jara ħafna.
Easy to say, so hard to do.	Faċli li tgħid, tant diffiċli li tagħmel.
I think you see where this is going	Naħseb li tara fejn sejjer dan
It won’t get any better out here.	Mhux se jkun aħjar hawn barra.
He can do whatever he wants.	Jista’ jagħmel li jrid.
I wasn’t on that	Jien ma kontx fuq dan
But so it must be.	Imma hekk għandu jkun.
We were tired.	Konna għajjien.
It's a lot.	Huwa ħafna.
And he did.	U għamel.
A few more hours will definitely be fine	Ftit sigħat oħra żgur li jkun tajjeb
I know very little.	Naf ftit li xejn.
Came there very, very well.	Daħal hemm ħafna, tajjeb ħafna.
It's so good.	Huwa daqshekk tajjeb.
I would be anything you want me to be	Jien inkun kull ħaġa li tixtieq li nkun
I wasn’t seeing much	Ma kontx qed nara ħafna
As well as they should.	Kif ukoll għandhom.
You don’t even want to.	Int lanqas trid.
It’s nothing to me.	Hija xejn għalija.
I can’t believe this is really happening to me	Ma nistax nemmen li dan verament qed jiġri lili
I think she was right	Naħseb li kellha raġun
He's coming back now.	Huwa ġej lura issa.
I am very happy with that	Jien kuntent ħafna b'dan
I hope to come soon	Nispera li jiġi dalwaqt
I don't know what it will be, but there must be something.	Ma nafx x’se jkun, imma jrid ikun hemm xi ħaġa.
I just want to be with you	Irrid inkun miegħek biss
From a man.	Minn raġel.
It's a bit like that.	Huwa daqsxejn hekk.
I know how it looks very good.	Naf kif jidher tajjeb ħafna.
That was it.	Li kien.
I couldn’t believe what he had just said	Ma stajtx nemmen dak li kien għadu kif qal
Probably too early.	Probabbilment kmieni wisq.
This is bad enough.	Dan huwa ħażin biżżejjed.
Which is really good.	Li huwa tajjeb verament.
I should be happy.	Għandi nkun kuntent.
He was doing it.	Huwa kien jagħmel dan.
Any work around ?.	Xi xogħol madwar?.
I think he knows where this is going	Naħseb li jaf fejn sejjer dan
And there it was.	U kien hemm.
I thought a lot about it	Ħsibt ħafna dwarha
I've never been there before	Qatt ma mort hemm qabel
I went to the back door	Jien mort lejn il-bieb ta’ wara
I'm ready for.	Jien lest għal.
One has to be.	Wieħed irid ikun.
And he must have.	U jrid ikollu.
You and I, we are what we are.	Int u jien, aħna dak li aħna.
I'm not ready for that yet	Għadni mhux lest għal dan
I have been doing this for a long time	Kont ilni nagħmel hekk
Too much work for just too much money.	Wisq xogħol għal ftit wisq flus.
I haven’t been in a few years	Ilni ma kontx fi ftit snin
Pretty much actually.	Pjuttost ħafna fil-fatt.
And only one thing.	U ħaġa waħda biss.
I had no idea what was wrong with me	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'kien ħażin miegħi
It could be no other.	Jista 'jkun l-ebda ieħor.
I needed to think more	Kelli bżonn naħseb aktar
And it just gets better and better.	U biss isir aħjar u aħjar.
You don't take anything.	Inti ma tieħu xejn.
I never understand how	Qatt ma nifhem kif
I don’t want you to think.	Ma rridx li taħseb.
And you always said it wouldn’t.	U int dejjem għedt li ma tkunx.
Today that’s someone I am.	Illum dak xi ħadd jien.
I know this is not enough	Naf li dan ma jkunx biżżejjed
I have no idea where to go from here	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn immur minn hawn
I had plenty of time to listen	Kelli ħafna ħin biex nisma
I have seen you before, and you have seen me	Rajt int qabel, u inti rajt lili
He may or may not do so	Jista’ jagħmel hekk jew le
You can.	Inti tista '.
He needed help.	Huwa kellu bżonn l-għajnuna.
You have to be good to go.	Għandek tkun tajba biex tmur.
It shouldn’t have taken that long.	Ma kellux jieħu daqshekk żmien.
He wasn’t sure why, but he did.	Ma kienx ċert għaliex, imma hekk għamel.
I will always be with you	Jien inkun dejjem miegħek
Now we know better.	Issa nafu aħjar.
I’m so not interested.	Jien hekk mhux interessat.
But no one seems to be talking about it.	Imma ħadd ma jidher li qed jitkellem dwarha.
I didn’t know what it was	Ma kontx naf dak li kien
He is still a friend.	Għadu ħabib.
I never thought this was going to happen	Qatt ma kont ħsibt li dan kien se jiġri
They were friends with many people.	Kienu ħbieb ma’ ħafna nies.
I was just listening to things	Jien kont għadni kemm kont qed nisma’ l-affarijiet
That was it.	Kien dak.
Not looking good.	Mhux qed jidher tajjeb.
I wasn't there yet.	Għadni ma kontx hemm.
We are now.	Aħna issa.
I didn’t want to talk about it	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwarha
We just have.	Għandna biss.
But it was not difficult.	Imma ma kienx diffiċli.
That went wrong.	Dak ħareġ ħażin.
Sometimes she did what she was supposed to do.	Xi drabi għamlet dak li suppost kellha.
He didn't seem to know what to say.	Jidher li ma kienx jaf x’għandu jgħid.
There must be more than that.	Għandu jkun hemm aktar minn hekk.
I have never seen a man happen faster.	Qatt ma rajt raġel jiġri aktar malajr.
He could only hope.	Huwa seta 'biss jittama.
I can see everything from here.	Jien nista' nara kollox minn hawn.
Someone big and tall	Xi ħadd kbir u twil
It was not so.	Ma kienx hekk.
It's never good.	Qatt mhu tajjeb.
I never wanted to do that.	Qatt ma ridt nagħmel hekk.
I’m actually having fun	Fil-fatt qed nieħu gost
I didn’t know.	Ma kontx naf.
Okay, said another.	Tajjeb, qal ieħor.
And, it was.	U, kien.
I didn’t want any of that	Ma ridt xejn minn dan
I know you wish it could be otherwise.	Naf li tixtieq li jista’ jkun mod ieħor.
Not from here.	Mhux minn hawn.
I was out for a while	Kont barra għal xi żmien
You don’t have much time.	M'għandekx ħafna ħin.
I know you will be fine	Naf li tkun tajjeb
Soon everyone was doing it.	Dalwaqt kulħadd kien qed jagħmel dan.
I only know these things	Naf biss dawn l-affarijiet
I've never been here before	Qatt ma kont hawn qabel
It all happened.	Dan kollu ġara.
And a little more besides.	U ftit aktar barra minn hekk.
And nothing seems to be working.	U jidher li xejn mhu qed jaħdem.
I have a place to go	Għandi fejn immur
I'm always first.	Jien dejjem l-ewwel.
Almost anything he wanted.	Kważi kull ħaġa li ried.
It really works.	Jaħdem tassew.
I'm very sorry to say	Jiddispjaċini ħafna ngħid
We do this at.	Aħna nagħmlu dan fi.
I could see where this was going	Stajt nara fejn kien sejjer dan
And you are not.	U m'intix.
First time for everything	L-ewwel darba għal kollox
It will be good.	Se jkun tajjeb.
She had to be.	Hi kellha tkun.
I'm not sure, really	M'inix ċert, tassew
And much more than you need.	U ħafna aktar milli għandek bżonn.
I will have to do this someday	Ikolli nagħmel dan xi darba
I know you want me all	Naf li trid lili kollha
That was my first year at work.	Dik kienet l-ewwel sena tiegħi fuq ix-xogħol.
Not easy, that's for sure.	Mhux faċli, dan żgur.
Nobody says anything.	Ħadd ma jgħid xejn.
Come on !.	Ejja!.
But nothing happened.	Imma ma ġara xejn.
I have a bit of a problem	Għandi daqsxejn problema
I heard someone say.	Smajt lil xi ħadd jgħid.
I know who they were before all this	Naf min kienu qabel dan kollu
That's not so.	Dak mhux hekk.
I know you were a good friend	Naf li kont qed tkun ħabib tajjeb
As they are.	Kif huma.
From what this.	Minn dak li dan.
I was too fast	Kont malajr wisq
More.	Aktar.
That was that.	Dik kienet dik.
And, in fact, they probably won't.	U, fil-fatt, huma probabbilment mhux se.
Better late than not.	Aħjar tard milli.
I'm not sure why.	M'inix ċert għaliex.
I think it wasn’t easy	Naħseb li ma kienx faċli
I will always be yours	Jien u dejjem se nkun tiegħek
Good with me.	Tajjeb miegħi.
He just looked like a happy man.	Huwa biss deher qisu raġel ferħan.
I thought it might work well	Ħsibt li jista' jaħdem tajjeb
She was a small boy.	Kienet tifel żgħir.
Most people.	Ħafna nies.
I couldn’t take that	Ma stajtx nieħu dan
I thought it was going very well	Ħsibt li kien sejjer tajjeb ħafna
He hadn’t really said much.	Huwa ma kienx verament qal ħafna.
It’s likely, probably.	Huwa probabbli, probabbilment.
I couldn’t understand anything.	Ma stajt nifhem xejn.
As you have before.	Kif għandek qabel.
He had nothing.	Ma kellu xejn.
I've never been able to tell you before	Qatt ma stajt ngħidlek qabel
One pretty big one.	Waħda pjuttost kbira.
We have a problem here	Għandna problema hawn
It just happened.	Huwa biss ġara.
But no one said you can’t do that.	Imma ħadd ma qal li ma tistax tagħmel dan.
I probably did.	Probabbilment għamilt.
This is really good.	Dan huwa tassew tajjeb.
Everything looked good.	Kollox deher tajjeb.
If only it were easy.	Kieku dan kien faċli biss.
I just couldn't believe it.	Biss ma stajtx nemmen.
I never knew who they were	Qatt ma kont naf min kienu
Glad not.	Ferħan mhux.
You're too young.	Int żgħir wisq.
That was something else.	Din kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'kien se jiġri wara.
You could say that.	Tista' tgħid hekk.
Obviously you have to go.	Ovvjament trid tmur.
I'm not going to school tomorrow	Jien mhux se mmur l-iskola għada
I wanted to be able to go often	Ridt inkun nista’ mmur spiss
No, no, really.	Le, le, tassew.
And better.	U aħjar.
No, you are not.	Le, m'intix.
I said at the time.	għidt dak iż-żmien.
Ours could be better.	Tagħna jista’ jkun aħjar.
I never was like that	Qatt ma kont hekk
But I can't do that.	Imma ma nistax nagħmel dan.
She is my son.	Hi tifel tiegħi.
I understand what he was going to do	Nifhem x’kien se jagħmel
He was thinking.	Huwa kien qed jaħseb.
I moved here three years ago	Mort hawn tliet snin ilu
I didn’t know where all this was coming from	Ma kontx naf minn fejn kien ġej dan kollu
I know she is there	Naf li hi hemm
I know this has not been easy for you	Naf li dan ma kienx faċli għalik
I know he wants to.	Naf li jrid.
I believe a lot of people have it all wrong	Nemmen li ħafna nies għandhom dan kollu ħażin
This was done as follows.	Dan sar kif ġej.
That is not happening.	Dak mhux qed jiġri.
She wasn’t doing it now.	Hija ma kinitx qed tagħmel dan issa.
It's too early.	Għadu kmieni.
I want to know who she is	Irrid inkun naf min hi
The timing must be exact.	Il-ħin irid ikun eżatt.
I didn’t know anyone saw me	Ma kontx naf li ra lili ħadd
Look where you are now.	Ħares fejn int issa.
He was tired of waiting.	Kien għajjien jistenna.
It will usually be the last.	Normalment ikun l-aħħar.
That's how it works.	Hekk jaħdem.
Maybe it’s not something everyone has.	Forsi mhix xi ħaġa li kulħadd għandu.
It needs to be if.	Jeħtieġ li jkun jekk.
People out there that.	Nies hemmhekk li.
You said it would.	Inti għedt li kieku.
I hope it happens soon.	Nittama li jiġri malajr.
I didn’t want to hope.	Ma kontx ridt nittama.
I just want to do my job	Irrid nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi biss
Or it could be harder.	Jew jista 'jkun aktar diffiċli.
I was completely happy	Kont kuntent għal kollox
I was trying to do well	Kont qed nipprova nagħmel tajjeb
And it won't.	U mhux se.
I had never seen one before	Qatt ma kont rajt waħda qabel
It's ours.	Huwa tagħna.
I never had to tell you about it	Qatt ma kelli ngħidlek dwarha
It would be too late to do that later.	Ikun tard wisq biex tagħmel dan aktar tard.
This was the house.	Din kienet id-dar.
You did well.	Int għamilt tajjeb.
I think he’s a good man	Naħseb li huwa raġel tajjeb
We just never did.	Biss qatt ma għamilna.
I can't talk to you right now	Ma nistax nitkellem miegħek bħalissa
I love being friends	Inħobb inkun ħbieb
I just moved here not long ago	Għadni kif mort hawn mhux twil ilu
This is done well.	Dan isir tajjeb.
I can do so much better	Nista' nagħmel ħafna aħjar
He never came from behind.	Hu qatt ma ġie minn wara.
No one wanted to know	Ħadd ma ried ikun jaf
Like everything else.	Bħal kull ħaġa oħra.
Good job to say so.	Xogħol tajjeb li tgħid hekk.
I try not to think about it here	Nipprova ma naħsibx dwarha hawn
I have much more to say	Għandi ħafna aktar xi ngħid
It just has to.	Għandu biss.
I'm sorry this happened.	Jiddispjaċini li ġara dan.
I’ll be back in a bit.	Ser inkun lura fi ftit.
He went outside.	Huwa mar barra.
But he did not know.	Imma dan ma kienx jaf.
I always thought so	Dejjem ħsibt dan
I wasn't so sure	Ma kontx daqshekk ċert
I hope everything goes well	Nispera li kollox imur tajjeb
Come on, let’s go.	Ejja, ejja mmorru.
She doesn’t want to talk about these things.	Hi ma tridx titkellem dwar dawn l-affarijiet.
But it is not working.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem.
I have to understand on my own	Ikolli nifhem waħdi
I can't do anything else	Ma nista nagħmel xejn aktar
He almost never wins.	Kważi qatt ma jirbaħ.
I never thought it would happen	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jiġri
How do you do.	Kif tagħmel int.
I thought you knew that by now	Ħsibt li inti taf li sa issa
That I wanted wrong	Dik ridt ħażin
I hope it seems.	Nispera li jidher.
I was alone here	Jien kont waħdi hawn
We had a great time there.	Kellna ħafna ħin hemmhekk.
Everything was going wrong.	Kollox kien isir ħażin.
There is no account.	M'hemm l-ebda kont.
And maybe not.	U forsi le.
Maybe it was so.	Forsi kien hekk.
I just want to talk to you.	Irrid biss nitkellem miegħek.
I saw everything.	Rajt kollox.
You can be sure of that.	Tista 'tkun ċert minn dan.
It should be.	Għandu jkun.
I like to think for you	Inħobb naħseb għalik
I went to school with him	Jien mort l-iskola miegħu
It's really hard.	Huwa verament diffiċli.
We only need a little time now.	Għandna bżonn biss ftit ħin issa.
You are not there yet.	Għadek m'intix hemm.
I just need some money	Għandi bżonn biss ftit flus
Well, there you have it.	Ukoll, hemm għandek.
This is what you are supposed to do.	Dan huwa dak li suppost tagħmel.
It seemed to work well.	Deher li jaħdem tajjeb.
Which it wasn’t.	Li ma kienx.
I think she’s just scared	Naħseb li hija biss jibża
I hope there is more like this.	Nispera li jkun hemm aktar bħal dan.
You are doing a good job.	Qed tagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
He left and took everything with him.	Telaq u ħa kollox miegħu.
Nor was she in the room.	Lanqas ma kienet fil-kamra.
I was really alone right now	Jien kont verament waħdi bħalissa
And you will be right.	U inti tkun raġun.
I know what you are.	Naf dak li int.
I need to go back there	Għandi bżonn nerġa’ nerġa’ nerġa’ hemm
I want you to be here with me now	Nixtieq li tkun hawn miegħi issa
It takes a lot of work.	Huwa jieħu ħafna xogħol.
I always thought the same	Dejjem ħsibt l-istess
It's been years.	Ilu snin.
Sometimes there is not enough money.	Xi drabi ma jkunx hemm biżżejjed flus.
Everything works fine.	Kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
She knew what she was going to do.	Kienet taf x’kien se jagħmel.
And on everything else.	U fuq kull ħaġa oħra.
Things do, you know.	L-affarijiet jagħmlu, taf.
But he knows nothing.	Imma ma jaf xejn.
He loved being there.	Kien iħobb ikun hemm.
And we both know where he is, but no one else knows.	U t-tnejn nafu fejn hu, imma ħadd ieħor ma jaf.
I'm glad she's here	Jien kuntent li hi hawn
He will be home tomorrow.	Hu se jkun id-dar għada.
He never gets better.	Hu qatt ma jmur aħjar.
You will see why, very quickly.	Inti se tara għaliex, malajr ħafna.
I thought you were on top of it all	Ħsibt li inti kont fuq dan kollu
I love doing these	Iħobb nagħmel dawn
There was no going back, now.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda tmur lura, issa.
That seemed.	Dak li deher.
I do this all the time	Nagħmel dan il-ħin kollu
I wasn’t sure there for a while	Jien ma kontx ċert hemm għal ftit żmien
I was worried about nothing.	Jien kont inkwetat dwar xejn.
I hope you can do something about it.	Nittama li tista 'tagħmel xi ħaġa b'dan.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange	Sa issa ma kontx ħsibt dwarha
I think it’s a good thing and a bad thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba u ħaġa ħażina.
I'm not going to talk to anyone	Jien mhu se nitkellem lil ħadd
I had to do it	I kellha tagħmel dan
I had no problem	Ma kelli l-ebda problema
Well my friend back then.	Ukoll ħabib tiegħi dak iż-żmien issa.
I didn’t want anything.	Jien ma ridt xejn.
I was happy to be here with you	Kont kuntent hawn miegħek
And, often.	U, ħafna drabi.
I hadn’t even thought about it	Jien lanqas biss kont ħsibt dwar dan
You want to know.	Tixtieq tkun taf.
I was never on one	Qatt ma kont fuq waħda
I want to try again	Irrid nipprova mill-ġdid
I’ve never been out here before	Qatt ma kont hawn barra qabel
I hope it keeps coming.	Nispera li jibqa' ġej.
I can only talk to him but nothing more.	Nista’ nitkellem miegħu biss imma xejn aktar.
I was both, neither	Jien kont it-tnejn, u lanqas
We have been doing it for a long time.	Aħna għamilna għal żmien twil.
And so it was now.	U hekk kien issa.
That was good for me.	Li kien tajjeb miegħi.
Usually a lot.	Normalment ħafna.
Always visible.	Dejjem tidher.
I had no idea what it was	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'kien
And not too fast.	U mhux malajr wisq.
I just have to wait	Ikolli biss nistenna
There there.	Hemm hemm.
Now, here you come.	Issa, hawn int ġej.
I am very sorry for this.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal dan.
I believe what he is saying	Nemmen dak li qed jgħid
One will be for you.	Wieħed se jkun għalik.
He has done this many times.	Huwa għamel dan ħafna drabi.
I was often very tired	Spiss kont għajjien ħafna
I hope so.	Nispera.
I know what you're doing	Naf x'qed tagħmel
Maybe that's what happened.	Forsi hekk ġara.
Maybe long.	Forsi twil.
That’s what we’re going to do here.	Dak se nagħmlu hawn.
I could see she was thinking	Stajt nara li kienet qed taħseb
I didn’t want to go there	Ma ridtx immur hemmhekk
But one has to.	Imma wieħed għandu.
I think it will be good now	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb issa
I couldn’t hear anymore	Ma stajtx nisma aktar
First lost.	L-ewwel tilef.
She was at work.	Hija kienet fuq ix-xogħol.
She knows she wants to go.	Hija taf li trid tmur.
I did nothing	Jien ma għamilt xejn
But now he can't.	Imma issa ma jistax.
He is my only friend.	Huwa l-uniku ħabib tiegħi.
I think someone knows	Naħseb li xi ħadd jaf
It's too good.	Huwa tajjeb wisq.
I thought I couldn't	Ħsibt li ma tistax
It will be working.	Se jkun qed jaħdem.
He just didn't know what it was.	Hu biss ma kienx jaf x’kien.
But today he had.	Imma llum kellu.
It has just started again.	Għadu kemm beda mill-ġdid.
I doubt anyone would.	Niddubita li xi ħadd jagħmel.
He can't do that.	Huwa ma jistax jagħmel dan.
There is nothing we can do right now.	M'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu bħalissa.
It's really good.	Huwa tassew tajjeb.
That was it, that was the time to go.	Dan kien, dan kien iż-żmien biex tmur.
I saw what was happening	Rajt x’kien qed jiġri
I couldn't see outside.	Ma stajtx nara barra.
I can't go there with you	Ma nistax immur hemm miegħek
I was right too.	Jien ukoll kelli raġun.
Or if it were.	Jew kieku kieku.
We know you can do much better.	Aħna nafu li tista 'tagħmel ħafna aħjar.
I love mine.	Jien inħobb tiegħi.
I always did it the first time	Dejjem għamilt l-ewwel darba
You want to know what you are doing and why.	Trid tkun taf x'qed tagħmel u għaliex.
I actually didn’t ask	Fil-fatt ma kontx nistaqsi
That would have been a lot.	Dan kien ikun ħafna.
Not a problem.	Mhix problema.
And we won't.	U aħna mhux ser.
I don’t know where I’m going from here.	Ma nafx fejn immur minn hawn.
I knew he didn’t like talking about these things	Kont naf li ma jħobbx jitkellem dwar dawn l-affarijiet
I wanted to know why	Ridt inkun naf għaliex
But he knew enough.	Imma kien jaf biżżejjed.
I'm glad for you.	Jien ferħan għalik.
This was.	Din kienet.
I would like to try this.	Nixtieq nipprova dan.
That's what we do.	Hekk nagħmlu.
I think everything is working as it should.	Naħseb li kollox qed jaħdem kif għandu jkun.
My job.	Ix-xogħol tiegħi.
He wasn't even sure he could.	Lanqas kien ċert li seta’.
I was good with that	I kien tajjeb ma 'dak
And it will never go back.	U qatt mhu se jmur lura.
Usually, this works.	Normalment, dan jaħdem.
Nor did I really believe it at the time	Lanqas ma kont nemmen tassew dak iż-żmien
It is.	Huwa.
I never expected to do that.	Qatt ma kont nistenna li tagħmel dan.
I have never done this before	Qatt ma għamilt dan qabel
I knew he wasn’t going to	Jien kont naf li ma kienx se
I just can’t.	Jien biss ma nistax.
I think that’s the only way	Naħseb li huwa l-uniku mod
I couldn't hear any more	Ma stajt nisma’ xi ħaġa aktar
He wants to go, he has to go, he said.	Huwa jrid imur, għandu jmur, qal.
It was so good.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb.
I can never go home now	Qatt ma nista’ mmur id-dar issa
Everyone looks so good.	Kulħadd jidher daqshekk tajjeb.
I don’t know anyone who does.	Ma naf lil ħadd li jagħmel.
I would very much like to know where she is	Nixtieq ħafna nkun naf fejn hi
Now we know you know everything.	Issa nafu li taf kollox.
I went home and thought about it	Mort id-dar u ħsibt dwar dan
No one knows for sure.	Ħadd ma jaf żgur.
I will not be back there	Jien mhux se nkun lura hemm
I was hoping he was home	Kont nittama li kien id-dar
No, that's not enough.	Le, dan mhux biżżejjed.
Good for me.	Tajjeb għalija.
It shouldn’t take too long, but who knows.	M'għandux jieħu wisq żmien, imma min jaf.
Who knows why.	Min jaf għaliex.
I need to know	Għandi bżonn inkun naf
He could do something.	Seta’ jagħmel xi ħaġa.
He won't want any.	Hu mhux se jkun irid l-ebda.
He told me last night.	Huwa qalli lbieraħ filgħaxija.
Mary returned with him.	Marija lura miegħu.
I hope he was gone forever	Jien nittama li kien mar għal dejjem
I’m really happy for him.	Jien tassew kuntent għalih.
I still have a way to go	Għadni mod kif immur
I never knew why	Qatt ma kont naf għaliex
I’m nothing and everything	Jien xejn u kollox
I like to be busy.	Inħobb inkun okkupat.
It was never there.	Qatt ma kien hemm.
But she’s not the only one.	Imma hi mhux l-unika waħda.
It was really great.	Kien tassew tajjeb ħafna.
It still looks like.	Għadu qisu.
It can't be done.	Ma jistax isir.
the.	le.
I was small, but not so small	Kont żgħir, imma mhux daqshekk żgħir
That time.	Dak il-ħin.
I want to do a little.	Irrid nagħmel ftit.
And both are me.	U t-tnejn huma jien.
After all, it wasn’t.	Wara, ma kienx.
Come back to me.	Jiġi lura għandi.
Obviously, he was right.	Ovvjament, kellu raġun.
They were more.	Kienu aktar.
And for me, so it was.	U għalija, hekk kien.
I know there is.	Naf li hemm.
Now is the time for him.	Issa wasal iż-żmien għalih.
I have to talk to someone	Ikolli nitkellem ma' xi ħadd
He is not a good man.	Mhuwiex raġel tajjeb.
I wonder where it might be	Nistaqsi fejn jista’ jkun
Now we know why.	Issa nafu għaliex.
Now she is back.	Issa hija lura.
This was better for you and better for me.	Dan kien aħjar għalik u aħjar għalija.
It was the first time he had been one.	Kienet l-ewwel darba li kien wieħed.
I have something you need to do for me	Għandi xi ħaġa li għandek bżonn tagħmel għalija
It could have been great.	Seta’ kien kbir.
It could have been much better.	Seta’ sar ħafna aħjar.
This had to happen fast enough.	Dan kellu jiġri malajr biżżejjed.
I will talk to him later	Jien se nitkellem miegħu aktar tard
I always say so myself.	Dejjem ngħid hekk jien.
I was once a child.	Darba kont tifel.
It happened that way.	Ġara hekk.
So much the better.	Tant aħjar.
Don't come here.	M'għandekx tiġi hawn.
I think you were right	Naħseb li kellek raġun
There is almost nothing I can do about it.	M'hemm kważi xejn li nista 'nagħmel dwar dan.
She had to come back.	Kellha tiġi lura.
I had to do what was best for me	Kelli nagħmel dak li kien aħjar għalija
I'm again.	Jien mill-ġdid.
Surely he could still be with me.	Żgur li seta’ għadu miegħi.
I just want to stand this.	Nixtieq biss noqgħod dan.
But you don't.	Imma inti ma.
I just moved here earlier today.	Għadni kemm mort hawn aktar kmieni llum.
We have a good time.	Għandna żmien tajjeb.
I couldn't see where	Ma stajtx nara fejn
This happens quite often.	Dan jiġri pjuttost spiss.
It's not hard to see why.	Mhux diffiċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
I wanted to know how it all started	Ridt inkun naf kif beda kollox
I don’t want to see anything.	Ma rrid nara xejn.
This is doing a lot with little.	Dan qed jagħmel ħafna bi ftit.
I had to eat	Kelli niekol
What he says is done.	Dak li jgħid isir.
I didn’t think this was good enough	Ma kontx ħsibt dan tajjeb biżżejjed
I should be glad to do so.	Għandi nkun ferħan li nagħmel hekk.
It would have been late.	Kienet tkun tard.
I want this book to be good.	Irrid li dan il-ktieb ikun tajjeb.
I was good for nothing	Kont tajjeb għal xejn
And it wasn’t like that.	U ma kienx hekk.
I knew it and so she did	Jien kont naf dan u hekk għamlet hi
too long.	twil wisq.
Everything will be fine for you here.	Kollox se jkun tajjeb għalik hawn.
Maybe this had really happened.	Forsi dan kien verament ġara.
I may be able to do that	Nista 'nkun kapaċi nagħmel dan
I knew it had to be, years ago.	Kont naf li kellha tkun, snin ilu.
It was wrong there.	Kien ħażin hemmhekk.
He was there to do that work.	Kien hemm biex jagħmel dak ix-xogħol.
I can't do that now	Ma nistax nagħmel dan issa
I’m not someone you want to know.	Jien mhux xi ħadd li trid tkun taf.
I knew what was wrong with me now	Kont naf x’kien ħażin miegħi issa
I wonder what will happen next	Nistaqsi x'se jiġri wara
Nobody in the room.	Ħadd fil-kamra.
You don’t want your help.	Ma tridx l-għajnuna tiegħek.
I will never know.	Jien qatt ma ser inkun naf.
He is not home.	Hu mhux id-dar.
And you can’t just take things.	U ma tistax tieħu l-affarijiet biss.
I knew she wasn't going to do that	Kont naf li ma kinitx se tagħmel dan
But this is too much for you.	Imma dan huwa wisq għalik.
It was going to be a big one.	Kienet se tkun waħda kbira.
I was no longer a child	Ma kontx tifel aktar
I see what you want.	Nara dak li trid.
He is so scared.	Huwa tant jibża.
And it was hard for him to do that.	U kien diffiċli għalih li jagħmel dan.
I’ve seen this before.	Rajt dan qabel.
I'm very happy if it can be helpful	Jien kuntent ħafna jekk jista' jkun ta' għajnuna
No one looked back.	Ħadd ma ħares lura.
You’re not really that scared.	M'intix verament daqshekk jibża'.
I said trying was not enough, but it really is	Għidt li nipprova ma kienx biżżejjed, imma tassew hu
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
I didn’t need to ask why	Ma kellix bżonn nistaqsi għaliex
There was nothing that anyone didn’t want.	Ma kien hemm xejn li xi ħadd ma riedx.
She was so good to me.	Hija kienet daqshekk tajba miegħi.
I thought, and it happened	Ħsibt, u ġara
I don’t think that’s likely to happen	Ma naħsibx li x'aktarx jiġri
I’ve never been so much before.	Qatt ma kont sa daqshekk qabel.
I'll have to see how it goes	Ikolli nara kif sejjer
It's not, of course.	Huwa mhux, ovvjament.
I don't know anything about that	Jien ma naf xejn dwar dan
They’re not eating anymore.	Dawn mhux qed niekol aktar.
I’m not saying it’s easy.	Mhux qed ngħid li huwa faċli.
As soon as.	Hekk kif.
And that’s just me.	U dak jien biss.
It just took a very long time.	Huwa biss ħa żmien twil ħafna.
He couldn't see anything anymore.	Ma seta’ jibqa’ jara xejn.
I will take that with me.	Jien se nieħu dak miegħi.
I think this will be right for you	Naħseb li dan se jkun tajjeb għalik
And what he had done.	U dak li kien għamel.
Not for him.	Mhux għalih.
You can't do anything about it.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel xejn dwar dan.
I went to work.	Jien mort ix-xogħol.
It’s something else wrong.	Hija xi ħaġa oħra ħażina.
And it was very, very difficult.	U kien diffiċli ħafna, ħafna.
I didn’t know anything.	Jien ma kont naf xejn.
Look around here.	Ħares madwar hawn.
I don't have to tell you	M'għandix ngħidlek
I have done this many times.	Dan għamilt ħafna drabi.
I wasn’t really thinking.	Jien ma kontx verament naħseb.
I had to tell someone.	Kelli ngħid lil xi ħadd.
She knew things.	Kienet taf l-affarijiet.
I haven't thought about it in years	Ilni snin ma naħseb dwarha
Come home with me.	Ejja d-dar miegħi.
For a while, everything was going so well.	Għal xi żmien, kollox kien sejjer daqshekk tajjeb.
He goes, but not as much as he thinks.	Imur, imma mhux kemm jaħseb hu.
Not too often.	Mhux wisq spiss.
From here it looks small.	Minn hawn jidher żgħir.
It is too busy at the moment.	Huwa okkupat wisq bħalissa.
I know what will happen	Naf x'se jiġri
Everyone knows that.	Kulħadd jaf li.
But it’s so hard here.	Imma huwa tant diffiċli hawn.
You will be with him soon.	Dalwaqt tkun miegħu.
She was very tired.	Kienet għajjien ħafna.
Not so.	Lanqas hekk.
And he did a little more.	U għamel ftit aktar.
I don't have one.	M'għandix waħda.
But please don't be.	Imma jekk jogħġbok ma tkunx.
It's a few years.	Huwa ftit snin.
I have seen this time and time again	Rajt dan darba u oħra
He never asked.	Hu qatt ma talab.
And you want to do it forever.	U trid tagħmel dan għal dejjem.
I really have to do something about it.	Għandi verament nagħmel xi ħaġa dwar dan.
More than that please.	Aktar minn dan jekk jogħġbok.
I couldn’t do it all the time	Ma stajtx nagħmel il-ħin kollu
I had never seen so much	Qatt ma kont rajt daqshekk
I wish you could stay well	Nixtieq li inti tista' toqgħod ukoll
But it would never come.	Imma qatt ma kien jiġi.
I needed to hear that	Kelli bżonn nisma’ hekk
Tired, she was so tired.	Għajjien, tant kienet għajjien.
He will never leave.	Qatt mhu se jitlaq.
No one knows for how long.	Ħadd ma jaf għal kemm żmien.
They are not after me.	Huma mhux wara lili.
I can’t really do much more	Ma nistax verament nagħmel ħafna aktar
The job is done.	Ix-xogħol isir.
I think this happens to everyone.	Naħseb li dan jiġri lil kulħadd.
I didn’t have a chance to go yesterday	Ma kellix ċans immur ilbieraħ
Maybe he knew.	Forsi kien jaf.
I used to do that too.	Jien kont nagħmel dan ukoll.
I think this might work	Naħseb li dan jista 'jaħdem
I believe it should be the same for everyone	Nemmen li għandu jkun l-istess għal kulħadd
I think that might help	Naħseb li dan jista 'jgħin
It could be that way.	Jista’ jkun hekk.
Come on.	Ejja tassew.
He has no friends.	M’għandux ħbieb.
I was definitely not happy	Żgur li ma kontx kuntent
And she definitely did the job.	U żgur li għamlet ix-xogħol.
Like a little boy.	Bħal tifel żgħir.
There's nothing I can do about it	Ma nista' nagħmel xejn
I didn’t want to talk about it anymore	Ma ridtx nitkellem aktar dwar dan
Good on everyone.	Tajjeb lil kulħadd.
I doubt anyone said that	Niddubita li xi ħadd qal hekk
Maybe it will help.	Forsi se jgħin.
I was doing so well.	Kont sejjer hekk tajjeb.
But everyone knows.	Imma kulħadd jaf.
No one is loving anyone.	Ħadd mhu qed iħobb lil ħadd.
But they are much better now.	Imma huma ħafna aħjar issa.
Big and little.	Kbir u ftit.
It happened very quickly	Ġara ħafna malajr
But here they are doing it all over again.	Imma hawn qed jagħmlu dan kollu mill-ġdid.
I may have done it but I didn't.	Seta’ kien għamilt imma ma kienx.
Someone has to say what	Xi ħadd għandu jgħid x'inhu
They have always been so.	Dejjem kienu hekk.
They are always with us.	Huma dejjem magħna.
I have to go tonight	Ikolli mmur illejla
Neither is she.	Lanqas hi.
I know how it happened	Naf kif ġara
Another chance will come.	Se jasal ċans ieħor.
No one knows.	Ħadd ma jkun jaf.
It seems easy.	Jidher faċli.
I didn’t have to be that way	Jien ma kellix inkun hekk
It was time.	Kien wasal iż-żmien.
I loved watching.	Kont inħobb nara.
I have to do it on my own	Ikolli nagħmel dan waħdi
But one could never be sure.	Imma wieħed qatt ma seta’ jkun ċert.
I was on to something more than great	Kont fuq xi ħaġa aktar minn kbira
He has to do something about it quickly.	Huwa għandu jagħmel xi ħaġa dwar dan malajr.
I thought it would be me	Ħsibt li se nkun jien
But everything seemed good to him.	Imma kollox deher tajjeb għalih.
I often do.	Ħafna drabi nagħmel.
I think about it so often	Naħseb dwarha daqshekk spiss
I think you think so	Naħseb li taħseb dan
Everything works fine.	Kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
Really, really late.	Tassew, tassew tard.
I couldn't see anything.	Ma stajt nara xejn.
I needed something else	Jien kelli bżonn xi ħaġa oħra
The big car.	Il-karozza kbira.
You have to think about both of them.	Int trid taħseb dwar it-tnejn li huma.
Whether or not it will be, no one knows.	Jekk hux se jkun jew le, ħadd ma jaf.
Everything you need to know was already there.	Dak kollu li għandek bżonn tkun taf kien diġà hemm.
I should probably do the same	Probabbilment għandi nagħmel l-istess
It should never have happened.	Qatt ma kellu jiġri.
I was hoping she was with you	Kont qed nittama li kienet miegħek
If they do, it's not a big deal.	Jekk jagħmlu hekk, mhux ħaġa kbira.
I expected better.	Kont nistenna aħjar.
He was not coming back.	Ma kienx ġej lura.
I think they are something else.	Naħseb li huma xi ħaġa oħra.
I didn’t do much.	Ma tantx għamilt.
She was a big boy.	Kienet tifel kbir.
I couldn't do it anymore	Ma stajtx nagħmel aktar
U fi, u fi.	U fi, u fi.
A pretty young man.	Raġel pjuttost żgħir.
A long, long time ago	Żmien twil, twil ilu
Nothing was easy for him.	Xejn ma kien faċli għalih.
I knew how it was	Kont naf kif kienet
He said only tonight.	Huwa qal biss illejla.
I was something else	Kont xi ħaġa oħra
I'm not like that.	Jien mhux hekk.
Just a little to.	Biss ftit lil.
What is it? ' 	Dak X'inhu?'
I couldn't wait	Ma stajtx nistenna
I think someone has come to him	Naħseb li xi ħadd wasal għandu
I can try	Nista' nipprova
He went wrong.	Huwa mar ħażin.
I never do, not really.	Jien qatt ma nagħmel, mhux verament.
Maybe more than one.	Forsi aktar minn wieħed.
Me and me.	Lili u jien.
I'll be back soon	Jien ser inkun lura dalwaqt
I really don’t.	Verament m'għandix.
It had to be him.	Kellu jkun hu.
It won’t happen tomorrow.	Mhux se jiġri għada.
You can go.	Inti tista 'tmur.
Very little, actually.	Ftit li xejn, fil-fatt.
I needed time to understand things	Kelli bżonn iż-żmien biex nifhem l-affarijiet
I need a big big one	Għandi bżonn kbir kbir
That he couldn’t.	Li ma setax.
I just didn’t want any more	Ma ridtx biss aktar
Just that and nothing more.	Biss dak u xejn aktar.
Nothing is there and no one is there to see anything be there.	Xejn mhu hemm u ħadd mhu hemm biex jara xejn ikun hemm.
He arrived too fast.	Huwa wasal malajr wisq.
You’re going, you know.	Int sejjer, taf.
I want to sit down.	Irrid noqgħod bilqiegħda.
Currently.	Bħalissa.
I had done something wrong	Kont għamilt xi ħaġa ħażina
But he could have stayed that way.	Imma seta’ joqgħod daqshekk.
I was too tired to do anything	Kont għajjien wisq biex nagħmel xi ħaġa
But it happens.	Imma jiġri.
He's just a man.	Huwa biss raġel.
It may be good, it may not be good.	Jista 'jkun tajjeb, jista' ma jkunx tajjeb.
It could have been that way.	Seta’ kien hekk.
I did a lot of work here for him	Għamilt ħafna xogħol hawn għalih
Sorry, friend.	Jiddispjaċini, ħabib.
You do or you don’t.	Inti tagħmel jew ma tagħmilx.
I will only stay here	Jien se noqgħod biss hawn
He said nothing about his problem.	Ma qal xejn dwar il-problema tiegħu.
For many, many years.	Għal ħafna, ħafna snin.
And he wanted to know why.	U ried ikun jaf għaliex.
Nothing was lost.	Xejn ma tilef.
You can’t do this alone.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan waħdek.
But here she will be.	Imma hawn hi se tkun.
Better be around.	Aħjar tkun madwar.
Or maybe too much.	Jew forsi wisq.
But he can't see where he is.	Imma ma jistax jara fejn hu.
In fact it happened often.	Fil-fatt ġara spiss.
And fun to be around.	U gost li tkun madwar.
I have to see a friend	Ikolli nara ħabib
And he had.	U kellu.
Man, but he wasn’t there.	Raġel, imma ma kienx hemm.
I was right, this was wrong	Kelli raġun, dan kien ħażin
But of course you can.	Imma ovvjament tista’.
He will never leave.	Qatt mhu se jitlaq.
I could barely see	Kważi ma stajtx nara
He usually does.	Normalment hekk jagħmel.
Do you think he would have had more for that?	Taħseb li kien ikollu aktar biss għal dan.
I think you should have been there	Naħseb li kellek tkun hemm
Just a little help.	Ftit għajnuna biss.
I have to ask.	Ikolli nistaqsi.
Here it is again.	Hawn hu mill-ġdid.
I did everything myself	Jien għamilt kollox jien
I can do a lot for you.	Nista’ nagħmel ħafna għalik.
He didn't even want to see anyone.	Lanqas ma ried jara lil ħadd.
Very glad.	Ferħan ħafna.
I didn’t really want to go there	Ma tantx ridt immur hemm
I can't wait to do it again	Ma nistax nistenna li nerġa' nagħmel
The following week.	Il-ġimgħa ta' wara.
It's still good.	Għadu tajjeb.
He didn't know anyone there.	Ma kien jaf lil ħadd hemmhekk.
No one was interested.	Ħadd ma kien interessat.
I won't be back until tomorrow	Mhux se nkun lura sa għada
He said nothing more.	Ma qal xejn aktar.
No one thinks anything about it.	Ħadd ma jaħseb xejn dwarha.
I know you like it that way.	Naf li tixtieq hekk.
But it wasn't mine.	Imma ma kienx tiegħi.
No one knows who she really is.	Ħadd ma jaf min hi tassew.
I think he should know	Naħseb li għandu jkun jaf
I couldn't wait to talk to you	Ma stajtx nistenna li nitkellem miegħek
I wasn’t scared.	Ma kontx nibża.
It was late, and he was tired.	Kien tard, u kien għajjien.
Everything was pretty ready.	Kollox kien pjuttost lest.
I'll try again later.	Ser nerġa' nipprova aktar tard.
I haven’t eaten since noon	Ilni ma niekol minn nofsinhar
I didn’t know enough	Ma kontx naf biżżejjed
I don't know who he is.	Ma nafx min hu.
She was doing everything.	Kienet tagħmel kollox.
I had to wait for that.	I kellha nistenna li.
Not today, never ever.	Mhux illum, qatt qatt.
You are right.	Għandek raġun.
I want to think things through on my own.	Nixtieq naħseb l-affarijiet waħdi.
I thought it was.	Ħsibt li kien.
Glad it came out.	Ferħan li ħareġ.
Everything you want done.	Dak kollu li tixtieq isir.
I'll be back soon	Inkun lura fi ftit
It may have been a lot of things, but it wasn't.	Jista’ jkun li kien ħafna affarijiet, imma ma kienx hekk.
I wish you knew	Nixtieq li kienet taf
Definitely would.	Żgur li kieku.
It’s not what we need.	Mhuwiex dak li għandna bżonn.
Not much more now.	Mhux wisq aktar issa.
You don’t even know where she is.	Lanqas taf fejn hi.
Please try again later.	Jekk jogħġbok, ipprova aktar tard.
I'll talk to you tomorrow night	Jien ser nitkellem miegħek għada filgħaxija
I can't wait for you	Ma nistax nistenna li int
Well, you did it.	Ukoll, inti għamilt dan.
I’m sure he had so much fun.	Jien ċert li ħa gost hekk.
I need to do this on my own	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan waħdi
One is easy.	Wieħed huwa faċli.
Friend, do what you had to do	Ħabib, jagħmel dak li kellu jagħmel
This is who you really are.	Dan hu min int verament.
And you know what to look for.	U taf x'għandu joqgħod.
I heard nothing.	Ma smajt xejn.
I never thought about it, you know	Jien qatt ma ħsibt dwarha, taf
I saw it all happen	Rajt dan kollu jiġri
She knows nothing more.	Hija ma taf xejn aktar.
Maybe not likely.	Forsi mhux probabbli.
Everything looked the same.	Kollox deher l-istess.
I couldn't tell who it was	Ma stajtx ngħid min kien
It felt just like that.	Ħassu eżatt hekk.
He was a boy.	Kien tifel.
He saw no need.	Ma ra l-ebda bżonn.
No, of course.	Le, ovvjament.
I was there a little while.	Kont hemm ftit ħin.
It has to be there.	Irid ikun hemm.
I didn't want anything	Ma ridt xejn
And never, ever, ever looked back.	U qatt, qatt, qatt ħares lura.
I think we are both	Naħseb li aħna t-tnejn
It needs to be seen.	Jeħtieġ li tidher.
I didn’t really do anything	Jien ma verament għamilt xejn
I will never know.	Qatt ma nkun naf.
I wanted my friend to be with me	Ridt li ħabib tiegħi jkun miegħi
Or so he had thought at the time.	Jew hekk kien ħaseb dak iż-żmien.
I was with him, but not really there	Kont miegħu, imma mhux verament hemm
He’s just a kid, really.	Huwa biss tifel, tassew.
I was nothing to you	Jien ma kont xejn għalik
Or it could be.	Jew jista 'jkun.
I understood	Kont nifhem
It usually isn’t like that.	Normalment ma jkunx bħal dan.
I’ve been able to do so much.	Jien stajt nagħmel daqshekk.
I did the same thing.	Jien għamilt l-istess ħaġa.
I hadn’t thought about that	Jien ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan
When he was a boy.	Meta kien tifel.
But he was not interested	Imma ma kienx interessat
I should be able to talk to you	Jien għandi nkun li nitkellem miegħek
There is a lot that is wrong with it.	Hemm ħafna li huwa ħażin miegħu.
And they never did.	U qatt ma kienu jagħmlu.
You have yours.	Għandek tiegħek.
And a great boy so.	U tifel kbir hekk.
I didn’t know why until now	Ma kontx naf għaliex sa issa
I wish you would be glad	Nixtieq li inti tkun ferħan
It is often not a big problem.	Spiss ma tkunx problema kbira.
That came later.	Dak ġie aktar tard.
And sometimes it actually did.	U xi drabi fil-fatt għamlet.
Not a great man.	Mhux raġel kbir.
I’m not going to make things any easier, either	Mhux se nagħmel l-affarijiet aktar faċli, lanqas
When everything is great, nothing is.	Meta kollox ikun kbir, xejn mhu.
So much the better.	Tant aħjar.
It can always happen if they.	Dejjem jista' jiġri jekk dawn.
I know you know where she is	Naf li taf fejn hi
It wasn’t just that she was beautiful.	Ma kienx biss li kienet sabiħa.
I want to tell you something	Irrid ngħidlek xi ħaġa
I thought you'd like to know	Ħsibt li tixtieq tkun taf
It doesn’t seem to be working.	Ma jidhirx li qed jaħdem.
But not fast enough.	Imma mhux malajr biżżejjed.
But not easy.	Imma mhux faċli.
I didn’t have time for it.	Ma kellix ħin għalih.
He had everything.	Kellu kollox.
Not quite alone.	Mhux pjuttost waħdu.
Come on come on come on come on.	Ejja ejja ejja ejja ejja.
I need to do it again.	Għandi bżonn li jerġa' jagħmel dan.
You just watch.	Inti biss tara.
Of so many people.	Ta’ tant nies.
I'm not busy at all.	Jien mhu okkupat xejn.
He must be going home.	Għandu jkun sejjer lura d-dar.
I needed something really fast	Kelli bżonn xi ħaġa tassew malajr
I have no idea how to do this.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif nagħmel dan.
I can be anything you want	Jien nista' nkun dak kollu li tixtieq
I have never seen this coming	Qatt ma rajt dan ġej
I can’t do these things alone	Ma nistax nagħmel dawn l-affarijiet waħdi
Big and small.	Kbir u żgħir.
There is no need to be afraid.	Wieħed m'għandux għalfejn jibża'.
We need to do a lot here.	Għandna bżonn nagħmlu ħafna hawn.
I had to do something before, nothing	I kellha tagħmel xi ħaġa qabel, xejn
He is a good person.	Huwa persuna tajba.
He wants to be happy.	Irid ikun kuntent.
Not the first time he has done this.	Mhux l-ewwel darba li għamel dan.
I was with him first	L-ewwel kont miegħu
I never wanted to know	Qatt ma ridt li tkun taf
I want to know what's going on	Irrid inkun naf x’qed jiġri
I'm really, really happy for you.	Jien tassew, tassew kuntent għalik.
I returned a little	I lura ftit
Not so now.	Mhux hekk issa.
Harder.	Aktar diffiċli.
I know all about it	Naf kollox dwarha
I had a time like this.	Jien kelli żmien bħal dan.
Not for what is wrong with him.	Mhux għal dak li hu ħażin miegħu.
Just one will suffice.	Wieħed biss ikun biżżejjed.
Or maybe it’s both.	Jew forsi huwa t-tnejn.
No one knew about it.	Ħadd ma kien jaf dwar dan.
Not by one man alone.	Mhux minn raġel wieħed waħdu.
Not so much.	Mhux daqshekk.
I'm worried for nothing	Jien inkwetat għal xejn
It will not be my home or your home.	Ma tkunx id-dar tiegħi jew id-dar tiegħek.
What's more ?.	X'hemm aktar?.
I thought it was going pretty well	Ħsibt li kien sejjer pjuttost tajjeb
I just don’t think so	Jien biss ma naħsibx hekk
No one did anything great about it.	Ħadd ma għamel xi ħaġa kbira dwarha.
I knew he had done this many times before.	Kont naf li kien għamel dan ħafna drabi qabel.
That was someone else's problem.	Dik kienet problema ta’ xi ħadd ieħor.
I’m actually talking to him	Fil-fatt nitkellem miegħu
He was about to leave.	Kien se jitlaq.
I don't know what's going on here.	Ma nafx x’qed jiġri hawn.
That was not my job.	Dak ma kienx xogħol tiegħi.
It is always so.	Huwa dejjem hekk.
I wonder what's wrong	Nistaqsi x'hemm ħażin
It's not good.	Mhuwiex tajjeb.
I did nothing wrong	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin
Usually.	Normalment.
It’s a really bad idea.	Hija idea tassew ħażina.
I saw you.	Rajt inti.
He is there.	Hu qiegħed hemm.
She was always in the back room.	Kienet dejjem fil-kamra ta’ wara.
I thought about it	Ħsibt dwarha
He was not like that.	Hu ma kienx hekk.
He knows better.	Jaf aħjar.
And everything is here and almost ready to go.	U kollox jinsab hawn u kważi lest biex imur.
We can.	Nistgħu.
It won’t just go away.	Mhux se jmur biss.
That was when.	Dan kien meta.
I didn’t have one for him	Jien ma kellix waħda għalih
Everything was happening so fast.	Kollox kien qed jiġri hekk malajr.
I had to see what he would do	I kellha nara x'kien se jagħmel
This does a few things.	Dan jagħmel ftit affarijiet.
He had a friend there with him.	Kellu ħabib hemm miegħu.
Not everyone knows about it either.	Ma jaf u lanqas dwar dan kulħadd.
I have time.	Għandi ħin.
It looked really good.	Kien jidher tassew tajjeb.
I will not wait forever	Jien mhux se nistenna għal dejjem
But it is being done later.	Imma qed isir aktar tard.
We have another.	Għandna ieħor.
He still has to say so.	Għadu jrid jgħid hekk.
I wouldn’t be	Jien ma kontx inkun
Someone else did.	Xi ħadd ieħor għamel.
I can't think of anything	Ma nista’ naħseb xejn
She hardly needed one.	Hija ma tantx kellha bżonn wieħed.
We know a lot more now.	Nafu ħafna aktar issa.
I hope he is.	Nispera li se.
I was very happy	Kont kuntent ħafna
I need you to see that	Għandi bżonn li inti tara li dan
Either tonight or tomorrow.	Jew illejla jew għada.
In fact, it was.	Fil-fatt, kien.
Well, it actually seems like it can be pretty good.	Ukoll, fil-fatt jidher li jista 'jkun pjuttost tajjeb.
He is afraid of what happened.	Jibża’ minn dak li ġara.
Last time.	L-aħħar darba.
He knew exactly who he wanted.	Kien jaf eżatt lil min ried.
It's so bad.	Huwa daqshekk ħażin.
Not bad, not good, nothing.	Mhux ħażin, mhux tajjeb, xejn.
It was just beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa biss.
It never seemed to be enough.	Qatt ma deher li kien biżżejjed.
That actually happened once.	Dak fil-fatt ġara darba.
They were too late.	Kienu tard wisq.
I could be someone else	Jien nista' nkun xi ħadd ieħor
I didn’t say anything more	Jien ma għidt xejn aktar
I want someone like that too	Jien ukoll irrid lil xi ħadd hekk
He just knew he still couldn’t leave.	Kien jaf biss li għadu ma setax jitlaq.
But you’re small, it happens.	Imma int żgħir, jiġri.
She was supposed to have it	Suppost li kellha x'aktarx
He did everything.	Kollox għamel.
I don’t think not.	Ma naħsibx li le.
There is no telling what they will do next.	M'hemm l-ebda tgħid x'se jagħmlu wara.
I don't see anyone.	Jien ma nara lil ħadd.
He needed to.	Huwa kellu bżonn.
I have to think a little	Ikolli naħseb ftit
This may be the first time.	Din tista’ tkun l-ewwel darba.
And if that happens.	U jekk jiġri hekk.
After that, it’s still nothing.	Wara dan, għadu xejn.
That and other things.	Dik u affarijiet oħra.
I’m not sure where I’m going to go from here.	M'inix ċert fejn se mmur minn hawn.
That should be enough.	Dan għandu jkun biżżejjed.
I want to know the same thing	Irrid inkun naf l-istess ħaġa
I do this every time	Dan nagħmel kull darba
Shortly before.	Ftit qabel.
I did exactly what I was told to do.	Għamilt eżatt dak li qalli nagħmel.
She wasn’t going to tell me.	Ma kinitx se tgħidli.
He sees nothing.	Ma jara xejn.
I didn't think of anything	Jien ma ħsibt xejn
I think it should be.	Naħseb li għandu jkun.
He saw you.	Huwa ra inti.
I shouldn’t be surprised	M'għandix inkun sorpriż
Not that either.	Mhux dik lanqas.
I can't understand the problem.	Ma nistax nifhem il-problema.
You want to know more.	Trid tkun taf aktar.
It's not good.	Mhuwiex tajjeb.
Nobody says anything about it	Ħadd ma jgħid xejn dwar dan
He loved everything he had to say.	Iħobb dak kollu li kellu xi jgħid.
I'm sure you can do that	Jiena ċert li tista 'tagħmel dan
I needed to know what he was doing	Kelli bżonn inkun naf x’kien qed jagħmel
It just won’t happen.	Huwa biss mhux se jiġri.
You have seen what they do.	Inti rajt dak li jagħmlu.
Not with this one.	Mhux b'dan wieħed.
But it couldn’t be.	Imma ma setax ikun.
I was not back	Jien ma kontx lura
But we do.	Imma nagħmlu.
He did none of these things.	Ma għamel xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet.
Well, anyone out there will know this.	Ukoll, xi ħadd hemmhekk se jkun jaf dan.
Or how.	Jew kif.
I knew one thing for sure	Kont naf ħaġa waħda żgur
I know you have something to say	Naf li għandek xi tgħid
I believe you can do that	Nemmen li tista’ tagħmel dan
I will never ask again.	Qatt ma nistaqsi mill-ġdid.
I can't see, I can't hear	Ma nistax nara, ma nistax nisma
With that you can come home.	B'dan tista' tiġi d-dar.
I wanted to see what you were doing	Ridt nara x'qed tagħmel
He was not surprised.	Ma kienx sorpriż.
I hope you are happy	Jien nittama li tkun kuntent
Everything that is happening.	Dak kollu li qed jiġri.
But we know better.	Imma nafu aħjar.
Nothing, probably.	Xejn, probabbilment.
I thought we could just be friends	Ħsibt li nistgħu nkunu biss ħbieb
I am now.	Jien issa.
But now it is too late.	Imma issa huwa tard wisq.
It shouldn't work.	M'għandux jaħdem.
That never works.	Li qatt ma jaħdem.
He pretty much knew a lot of things.	Pjuttost kien jaf ħafna affarijiet.
It's just a little bit.	Hija ftit ftit.
Everyone comes here.	Kulħadd jiġi hawn.
I'm not doing anything for you	Jien ma nagħmel xejn għalik
But, I'm back.	Imma, jien lura.
How soon he did not know.	Kemm malajr ma kienx jaf.
This should be a lot for you to take.	Dan għandu jkun ħafna għalik li tieħu.
It surprised me.	Huwa sorpriż lili.
But she knew the truth.	Imma hi kienet taf il-verità.
It always has been and always will be.	Dejjem kien u dejjem se jkun.
I wanted it that way.	Jien ridt hekk.
They felt very happy.	Ħassu kuntent ħafna.
For that may be.	Għal li jista 'jkun.
I had no idea you were coming today	Ma kellix idea li ġejt illum
I thought you had.	Ħsibt li kellek.
But to each of his own.	Imma lil kull wieħed tiegħu.
It won't take long	Mhux se nieħu ħafna ħin
He knows he’s not supposed to come here.	Jaf li mhux suppost jiġi hawn.
I can't see anything	Ma nista' nara xejn
I won’t tell you where they are.	Jien mhux se ngħidlek fejn huma.
I do the same.	Jien nagħmel l-istess.
I wasn’t sure what to say	Ma kontx ċert x'se ngħid
I knew it wouldn’t be	Kont naf li mhux se jkun
I want to talk to him	Irrid nitkellem miegħu
She would never have done this if she had been good.	Hija qatt ma kienet tagħmel dan kieku kienet tajjeb.
I’m still trying to do better	Għadni qed nipprova nagħmel aħjar
I would know.	Inkun naf.
I know better than that.	Naf aħjar minn hekk.
You know you know.	Int taf li taf.
I wish he was here now	Nixtieq li kien hawn issa
There won’t be.	Mhux se jkun hemm.
Not about that.	Mhux dwar dan.
They were here first.	Kienu hawn l-ewwel.
But it was a better time.	Imma kien żmien aħjar.
I was just his friend	Kont biss ħabib tiegħu
I just want it all to go away	Irrid biss li dan kollu jitlaq
I will have to stay here with you	Ikolli noqgħod hawn miegħek
I can’t do all this alone	Ma nistax nagħmel dan kollu waħdi
And he went back from that.	U mar lura minn dak.
You stay here.	Inti toqgħod hawn.
Not too much.	Mhux ftit wisq.
I probably won't be able to stay long	Probabbilment mhux se nkun kapaċi noqgħod twil
It can't be fast enough !.	Ma jistax jiġi malajr biżżejjed!.
This happens.	Dan jiġri.
But that was not a problem.	Imma dik ma kinitx problema.
Something else will happen.	Se jiġri xi ħaġa oħra.
I have to go on one.	Għandi mmur fuq waħda.
It can take on anything.	Hija tista 'tieħu fuq kollox.
I was sitting when he entered the room	Kont bilqiegħda meta daħal fil-kamra
Hours, he will.	Sigħat, hu se.
I was sitting right here.	Kont bilqiegħda eżatt hawn.
So it was and she knows that.	Hekk kien u hi taf li.
Maybe not so.	Forsi mhux hekk.
I was sure it happened that way	Jien kont ċert li ġara hekk
Don't do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan.
We want something else.	Irridu xi ħaġa oħra.
I didn't want that to happen	Ma ridtx li jiġri hekk
I can’t see much.	Ma nistax nara ħafna.
You really are something.	Int verament xi ħaġa.
I wasn’t ready to do that yet	Għadni ma kontx lest li nagħmel dan
She was doing what needed to be done.	Kienet tagħmel dak li kien hemm bżonn tagħmel.
Some time had passed.	Kien għadda xi żmien.
It will probably happen.	Probabbilment se jiġri.
I couldn’t think of anything to say.	Ma stajt naħseb xi ngħid.
I want you to stay	Irrid li inti toqgħod
There was a lot of money.	Kien hemm ħafna flus.
I think we were.	Naħseb li konna.
I'm wondering what's going on with him	Qed nistaqsi x’qed jiġri miegħu
I did for years.	Għamilt għal snin.
Look at that.	Ħares lejn dak.
Someone has to do something with it now.	Xi ħadd irid jagħmel xi ħaġa miegħu issa.
He is happy.	Huwa kuntent.
And no one else.	U ħadd ieħor.
I really wasn't doing anything wrong	Verament ma kont qed nagħmel xejn ħażin
I was right.	Kelli raġun.
I needed to tell you	Kelli bżonn ngħidlek
It probably never was.	Probabbilment qatt ma kien.
There was no going back now.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda tmur lura issa.
Nor should they.	Lanqas ma għandhom.
I had one of everything.	Kelli waħda minn kollox.
I wanted to know better	Ridt inkun naf aħjar
We will never know now.	Qatt ma nkunu nafu issa.
I will be home soon	Se nkun id-dar fi ftit żmien
That was when, years back.	Dan kien meta, snin lura.
There is no problem.	M'hemm l-ebda problema.
He is not here at the moment.	Huwa mhux hawn bħalissa.
He didn't know much.	Ma kienx jaf ħafna.
It will be from behind.	Se jkun minn wara.
Most may not happen.	Ħafna jista 'ma jiġri.
I do everything for myself	Jien nagħmel kollox għalija
I see something there	Nara xi ħaġa hemmhekk
I did a good job too	Jien għamilt xogħol tajjeb ukoll
I really need your help	Għandi bżonn ħafna l-għajnuna tiegħek
I don't have time for that	M'għandix ħin għal dan
Everything is going well with me.	Kollox sejjer tajjeb miegħi.
He does this for about a year.	Jagħmel dan għal madwar sena.
I still, forever will	Jien għadni, għal dejjem se
No one else was in the room.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien fil-kamra.
I think that’s all we can do here tonight	Naħseb li dak kollu li nistgħu nagħmlu hawn illejla
Maybe more than one.	Forsi aktar minn wieħed.
We had a pretty good time.	Kellna pjuttost tajjeb.
And there it is.	U hemm biss.
I didn't either	Lanqas għamilt
I was a late boy.	Jien kont tifel tard.
But this is not what happens.	Imma dan mhux dak li jiġri.
She's scared of something.	Jibża’ minn xi ħaġa.
It's late afternoon.	Huwa tard wara nofsinhar.
I thought for sure you had	Ħsibt ċert li kellek
I said so.	Jien għidt hekk.
I was still me, but not really	Kont għadni jien, imma mhux tassew
I needed to be good to be alone	Kelli bżonn inkun tajjeb li tassew inkun waħdi
And you will think about it.	U int se taħseb dwar dan.
Or not for long.	Jew mhux għal żmien twil.
There were people here.	Kien hawn nies.
I can't, I can't, I can't	Ma nistax, ma nistax, ma nistax
I have no idea why she's here	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex hi hawn
I have no idea about that	M'għandi l-ebda idea dwar dan
It's too good.	Huwa tajjeb wisq.
I couldn’t believe it was happening	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien qed jiġri
Everyone had left.	Kulħadd kien telaq.
We know what we're doing.	Nafu x’qed nagħmlu.
If you think about it, that's what we do.	Jekk taħseb dwarha, huwa dak li nagħmlu.
He was loved once.	Kien iħobb darba.
He could go back to other things.	Seta’ jerġa’ lura għal affarijiet oħra.
You were not able to tell.	Inti ma kontx kapaċi tgħid.
She was too tired.	Kienet għajjien wisq.
It's for you.	Huwa għalik.
I know you didn’t want me	Naf li ma ridtx lili
But you never see that happen.	Imma qatt ma tara li jiġri.
A man could not stay there.	Raġel ma setax joqgħod hemm.
I have to think about something else	Għandi naħseb dwar xi ħaġa oħra
Maybe he can.	Forsi jista’.
I want to know more here	Irrid inkun naf aktar hawn
It's been a few years.	Ilu ftit snin.
But of course, he’s not here.	Imma ovvjament, hu mhux hawn.
Or it works.	Jew jaħdem.
I hadn’t seen this before	Ma kontx rajt dan qabel
I didn’t want to take a chance	Ma ridt nieħu ċans
This was the first.	Din kienet l-ewwel.
He was a good man.	Kien raġel tajjeb.
I had to do it myself.	Kelli nagħmel jien.
I just need more time	Għandi bżonn biss aktar ħin
This is probably not what you want.	Dan huwa probabbilment mhux dak li trid.
I didn't think much of it	Ma tantx ħsibt dwarha xejn
I’m not done for that.	Jien mhux qed isir għal dan.
I can do this on my own now	Nista' nagħmel dan waħdi issa
Maybe he wanted to say both.	Jista’ jkun li ried jgħid it-tnejn.
I won’t say more now	Mhux se ngħid aktar issa
He is ready.	Huwa lest.
No one really knew.	Ħadd ma kien jaf tassew.
That’s what we needed.	Dak hu li kellna bżonn.
I wasn’t worried at all	Jien ma kont inkwetat xejn
So too.	Hekk ukoll.
I have already done so.	Diġà għamilt hekk.
I won’t be over tomorrow.	Mhux se nkun aktar minn għada.
In fact no one did.	Fil-fatt ħadd ma għamel.
I hope they do well	Nispera li jagħmlu tajjeb
And not just you.	U mhux int biss.
Great way.	Mod kbir.
I haven't done that in a long time	Ilni ma nagħmel hekk
I just wanted to talk to him	Ridt biss nitkellem miegħu
And it's a good job.	U huwa xogħol tajjeb.
I can never go back there	Qatt ma nista’ mmur lura hemm
There is no one you can do everything you want.	M'hemm l-ebda inti tista 'tagħmel dak kollu li trid.
No one was going to do this for you.	Ħadd ma kien se jagħmel dan għalik.
I know how we can do that	Naf mod kif nistgħu nagħmlu dan
It comes early, and it comes to stay.	Jiġi kmieni, u jiġi biex jibqa’.
I want you to tell me.	Nixtieq li tgħidli.
It wasn't.	Ma kienx.
I can’t believe you’re not taking it	Ma nistax nemmen li mhux qed tieħu
I was just amazed at how great everything was	Kont biss sorpriż kemm kien kbir kollox
In fact, it was going faster.	Fil-fatt, kien sejjer aktar malajr.
How they felt.	Kif ħassu.
I know why he had to go	Naf għaliex kellu jmur
It should be a happy time.	Għandu jkun żmien kuntent.
It was who he was now.	Kien min kien issa.
This is something to do.	Din hija xi ħaġa li tagħmel.
Please don't.	Jekk jogħġbok ma tkunx.
I think they were making fun of me	Naħseb li kienu qed jagħmlu gost miegħi
There is something behind that.	Hemm xi ħaġa wara dik.
I never wanted you to know the truth	Qatt ma ridt li tkun taf il-verità
He was thinking.	Kien qed jaħseb.
That’s not what was really going to happen.	Dak mhux dak li verament kien se jiġri.
I could do it myself	Jien stajt nagħmel jien
I had never done anything wrong	Qatt ma kont għamilt xejn ħażin
I have to be like everyone else.	Għandi nkun bħal kulħadd.
They never are.	Huma qatt ma huma.
Most people have.	Ħafna nies għandhom.
Before it's too late.	Qabel ma jkun tard wisq.
I don’t want to do that.	Ma rridx nagħmel hekk.
You have a chance.	Għandek ċans.
I just want to be sure	Irrid inkun ċert biss
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Forsi, forsi, forsi.
She had lovers.	Hija kellha min iħobb.
Or something.	Jew ħaġa.
I couldn't understand what I was doing	Ma stajtx nifhem dak li kont tagħmel
So it seems.	Hekk jidher.
I was thinking the same thing	Kont qed naħseb l-istess
If it happens, it happens.	Jekk jiġri, jiġri.
I was scared of a child	Jien kont nibża’ ta’ tifel
The work was done.	Ix-xogħol kien sar.
He just wasn’t ready.	Hu biss ma kienx lest.
There is no way back for me there now.	M'hemm l-ebda mod lura għalija hemm issa.
I wasn't ready yet	Għadni ma kontx lest
I can't tell you about it	Ma nistax ngħidlek dwarha
This works so.	Dan jaħdem hekk.
It's a man's thing.	Hija ħaġa ta' raġel.
He went quickly.	Huwa mar malajr.
But one morning.	Imma waħda filgħodu.
I wanted him to do something, to say something	Ridt li jagħmel xi ħaġa, li jgħid xi ħaġa
I know it’s not enough to be there.	Naf li mhux biżżejjed li tkun hemm.
You come home and tell me nothing so far.	Tiġi d-dar u tgħidli xejn sa issa.
I never had any problems	Qatt ma kelli xi problemi
How far can you go ?.	Kemm tista' tmur?.
Something was wrong with him.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina miegħu.
He had not finished his work.	Huwa ma kienx lest ix-xogħol tiegħu.
I should probably go back	Probabbilment għandi nerġa' lura
Not ready yet.	Għadu mhux lest.
He had to think about it.	Kellu jaħseb dwarha.
And how it happens, no one really knows.	U kif jiġri, ħadd ma jaf verament.
I was there when it happened	Jien kont hemm meta ġara
Sorry, no, he said.	Jiddispjaċini, le, qal.
I'm just one person	Jien persuna waħda biss
I came here to talk to you	Ġejt hawn biex nitkellem miegħek
I think we have	Naħseb li għandna
It never is.	Qatt mhu.
I didn’t want to do that	Ma ridtx nagħmel dan
This is too late.	Dan huwa tard wisq.
I know he did.	Naf li għamel.
I know this can't be right	Naf li dan ma jistax ikun tajjeb
It's just.	Huwa biss.
I heard this a few years ago	Smajt dan ftit snin ilu
I don’t really know.	Ma nafx verament.
I didn’t know why at the time	Ma kontx naf għaliex dak iż-żmien
I had people on before	Kelli nies fuq qabel
There was nothing he could do.	Ma seta’ jagħmel xejn.
There were not many people to see.	Ma tantx kien hemm nies x’tara.
That's all.	Dan huwa kollox.
Like everyone else.	Bħal kulħadd.
It works great.	Jaħdem ħafna.
And he did.	U dan għamel.
I just want to know the truth	Irrid biss inkun naf il-verità
We are doing so.	Qed nagħmlu hekk.
But it looks really good.	Imma jidher tassew tajjeb.
I understand he is busy	Nifhem li hu okkupat
But it was not the time.	Imma ma kienx il-ħin.
I’m the only one I’m there with.	Jien l-uniku jien li hemm.
I am much better than that	Jiena ħafna aħjar minn hekk
I say he would have and will not have.	Ngħid kien ikollu u mhux se jkollu.
It was bad.	Kien ħażin.
I just thought.	Ħsibt biss.
I think I’ve done better	Naħseb li stajt għamilt aħjar
I wanted to be happy with him	Ridt inkun kuntent miegħu
There should be some about.	Għandu jkun hemm xi wieħed dwar.
I wasn’t worried about it at all	Jien ma kont inkwetat dwarha xejn
I know this works.	Naf li dan jaħdem.
I understand everything, we really do	Nifhem dak kollu, verament nagħmlu
I have a lot of time.	Għandi ħafna ħin.
I haven't had this in a long time	Ilni ma kellix dan
It can't be done.	Ma jistax isir.
I know this better than anyone	Dan naf aħjar minn ħadd
I know this is not going to be a problem.	Naf li din mhux se tkun problema.
He may know.	Jista’ jkun jaf.
Or when he is, that was it.	Jew meta hu, dak li kien.
I never said that.	Qatt ma għidt hekk.
Probably too.	Probabbilment wisq.
He took everything on his own.	Huwa ħa kollox waħdu.
They were always around.	Kienu dejjem madwar.
There is nothing anyone can do.	M'hemm xejn li xi ħadd jista' jagħmel.
It should be a few hours.	Għandu jkun ftit sigħat.
I just can’t do it alone	Jien biss ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi
A few years.	Ftit snin.
That's one way.	Dak huwa mod wieħed.
I went to the door	Jien mort lejn il-bieb
More than more than enough.	Aktar minn aktar minn biżżejjed.
Again.	Darba oħra.
And he was scared.	U kien jibża.
I just want to be friends again	Irrid inkun biss ħbieb mill-ġdid
That never felt good to us.	Li qatt ma ħassu tajjeb għalina.
He left, and he will never return.	Telaq, u qatt mhu se jerġa’ lura.
I have to be.	Ikolli nkun.
I wasn’t sure what would happen next	Ma kontx ċert x'se jiġri wara
Definitely too fast.	Żgur malajr wisq.
He was just worried about how late we were.	Kien inkwetat biss dwar kif konna tard.
You're there.	Int hemmhekk.
We will do everything.	Aħna se nagħmlu kollox.
Not yet you are not.	Għadu mhux int m'intix.
I didn't want to see anything	Ma ridt nara xejn
But no one had anything to say wrong.	Imma ħadd ma kellu xi jgħid ħażin.
I thought about it later	Ħsibt dwar dan aktar tard
And he will be with us.	U hu jkun magħna.
I have to say it was a good time.	Ikolli ngħid li kien żmien tajjeb.
I shouldn't be here	M'għandix inkun hawn
I wonder when it will be.	Nistaqsi meta se jkun.
And everyone knew.	U kulħadd kien jaf.
They are for you.	Huma għalik.
I can’t say much more than that right now	Ma nistax ngħid ħafna aktar minn hekk bħalissa
I want to, but not here	Irrid, imma mhux hawn
If we can please.	Jekk nistgħu jekk jogħġbok.
I really want you there	Nixtieq verament inti hemmhekk
I shouldn't do that	M'għandix nagħmel dan
I couldn’t believe I did that	Ma stajtx nemmen li għamilt hekk
It looks good.	Jidher tajjeb.
He is a boy.	Huwa tifel.
You will be able to go home.	Int tkun tista' tmur id-dar.
I just need a little time alone	Għandi bżonn biss ftit ħin waħdi
He seems to be the only one.	Jidher li hu l-uniku wieħed.
I want to stay there for a while	Irrid li toqgħod hemm għal xi żmien
He will never do that.	Hu qatt mhu se jagħmel hekk.
I was counting on this for us	Jien kont noqgħod fuq dan għalina
I can’t stay home doing nothing	Ma nistax noqgħod id-dar ma nagħmel xejn
This is mine.	Din hija tiegħi.
He did nothing.	Ma għamel xejn.
Today I wanted to eat alone	Illum ridt niekol waħdi
She wants to.	Hija trid.
They were people.	Kienu nies.
As you want to know.	Kif trid tkun taf.
She was very beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa ħafna.
I know this.	Naf dan.
I think this is for me	Naħseb li dan huwa għalija
You're not saying !.	Mhux qed tgħid!.
It wasn’t hard.	Ma kienx diffiċli.
Probably still.	Probabbilment għadu hekk.
I see nothing wrong.	Ma nara xejn ħażin.
What was once easy is now difficult.	Dak li darba kien faċli issa huwa diffiċli.
I just wanted to see what would happen	Ridt biss nara x'se jiġri
He had money.	Kellu flus.
If any.	Jekk ikun hemm.
I need to do more than that	Għandi bżonn nagħmel aktar minn dan
Good enough, he thought.	Tajjeb biżżejjed, ħaseb.
I'm here.	Jien hawn.
Great, he said.	Kbir, qal.
If not, whatever.	Jekk le, tkun xi tkun.
But no one knew much.	Imma ħadd ma kien jaf ħafna.
I thought it was great	Ħsibt li kien kbir
You can’t know what it is.	Ma tistax tkun taf x'inhi.
There is only one.	Hemm wieħed biss.
I need to know what's behind that door	Għandi bżonn inkun naf x’hemm wara dak il-bieb
He is someone we know.	Huwa xi ħadd li nafu.
No one wants that !.	Ħadd ma jrid hekk!.
That he didn’t want to.	Li ma riedx.
We do our own.	Aħna nagħmlu tagħna.
I would be that for you	Inkun dak għalik
I've never been with a man	Qatt ma kont ma’ raġel
It's just.	Huwa biss.
He had gone for three years.	Huwa kien mar għal tliet snin.
You are one.	Inti wieħed.
Very good person.	Persuna tajba ħafna.
You know something.	Taf xi ħaġa.
I certainly wasn't expecting that	Żgur li ma kontx qed nistenna hekk
I have to do something about it	Ikolli nagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha
No, my friend.	Le, ħabib tiegħi.
time.	ħin.
This is how you do it.	Dan huwa kif tagħmel dan.
Maybe another child will help.	Forsi tifel ieħor jgħin.
He didn’t know where we were.	Ma kienx jaf fejn konna.
I have a lot of friends out there	Għandi ħafna ħbieb hemmhekk
Not now.	Mhux issa.
But I’m not sure how I’m going to do it.	Imma m'inix ċert kif se nagħmel.
I never want to be alone	Qatt ma rrid inkun waħdi
I just wanted it to be as easy as possible	Ridt biss li dan ikun faċli kemm jista 'jkun
You really don’t need something so big.	Int verament m'għandekx bżonn xi ħaġa daqshekk kbira.
He may be right.	Jista’ jkollu raġun.
and all that.	u dak kollu.
She knew everything.	Kienet taf kollox.
I don't know how he could have done that	Ma nafx kif seta’ jagħmel dan
I know what you're doing	Naf x’qed tagħmel
We will do both.	Aħna se nagħmlu t-tnejn.
Let's see where.	Ejja fejn.
If she knew where he was, she would go to him.	Kieku kienet taf fejn kien, kienet tmur għandu.
I was very surprised	Kont sorpriż ħafna
I didn’t really know what to expect	Ma kontx verament naf x'se nistenna
This has happened before.	Hekk ġara qabel.
I didn’t even hear what he said	Lanqas smajt dak li qal
He said this.	Huwa qal dan.
.	.
Now I know what it was all about	Issa naf x’kien kollu
I know it was for me.	Naf li kien għalija.
They are very much on that.	Huma ħafna fuq dak.
Now I see what you're saying	Issa nara x’qed tgħid
He or one or the other, not both.	Hu jew wieħed jew ieħor, mhux it-tnejn.
I thought everyone knew this.	Ħsibt li kulħadd kien jaf dan.
I’m a small child again.	Jien tifel żgħir mill-ġdid.
I still want the job	Għadni rrid ix-xogħol
It doesn’t seem to be coming.	Ma jidhirx li ġej.
I was sure it was	Kont ċert li kien hekk
You alone.	Int biss.
The truth is that no one knows.	Il-verità hi li ħadd ma jaf.
But that was a long time ago.	Imma dan kien żmien twil ilu.
He sure did.	Huwa żgur li għamel.
I think that’s all we can do	Naħseb li dak kollu li nistgħu nagħmlu
Everything else is working fine so far.	Kollox ieħor jaħdem tajjeb sa issa.
I think it will go faster.	Naħseb li se aktar malajr.
I wonder who the house was	Nistaqsi ta’ min kienet id-dar
A little here, a little there	Xi ftit hawn, ftit hemm
It was hard at times.	Kien diffiċli xi drabi.
I said too much.	Għidt wisq.
But there was something there.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
He wanted more, and she probably didn't want to.	Hu ried aktar, u hi x’aktarx li ma riedx.
I know you have one.	Naf li għandek waħda.
It was.	Kienet.
And a good one.	U waħda tajba.
But he wanted to do more.	Imma ried jagħmel aktar.
I'm very busy.	Jien okkupat ħafna.
I’m here all the time.	Jien hawn il-ħin kollu.
I wanted it out.	Jien ridt barra.
This too.	Dan ukoll.
I knew she never would.	Kont naf li hi qatt ma.
You are our friend.	Int ħabib tagħna.
I want to be like that	Nixtieq inkun hekk
That's what we do.	Huwa dak li nagħmlu.
Nobody did.	Ħadd ma għamel.
But it wasn’t, of course.	Imma ma kienx, ovvjament.
I have to go back home and think.	Ikolli mmur lura d-dar u naħseb.
We know where he is.	Nafu fejn hu.
Big problem.	Problema kbira.
But now, there is nothing there.	Imma issa, m'hemm xejn hemmhekk.
He will know what to do.	Hu se jkun jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
I heard little, I saw nothing.	Smajt ftit, ma rajt xejn.
I was having too much fun	Kont qed nieħu gost wisq
I couldn’t do it alone	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan waħdi
I wasn’t a big man	Ma kontx raġel kbir
I'm sure you'll see this.	Jien ċert li se tara dan.
I wish it wasn’t there	Nixtieq li ma kienx hemm
Not too fast.	Mhux malajr wisq.
She must have made money.	Hija trid tkun għamlet flus.
I don't know what's going on before.	Ma nafx x’qed jiġri qabel.
Now I could see what he could see	Issa stajt nara dak li seta’ jara
I was too worried	Kont inkwetat wisq
I thought maybe I did.	Ħsibt li forsi għamilt.
But he did not want to stay there.	Imma ma riedx jibqa’ hemm.
I always thought he was a boy	Dejjem ħsibt li kien tifel
I had an idea where it could be.	Kelli idea fejn jista’ jkun.
She has done this many times.	Hija għamlet dan ħafna drabi.
That's what they do.	Huwa dak li jagħmlu.
I’m sure you’ve heard it before	Jiena ċert li diġà smajt
I will probably try	Probabbilment se nipprova
How it was about.	Kif kien madwar .
But he had not returned.	Imma ma kienx ġie lura.
But this.	Imma dan.
And where she was now.	U fejn kienet issa.
Too much to plan.	Wisq biex tippjana.
I wanted to talk about it.	Ridt nitkellem dwarha.
I wish you didn’t.	Nixtieq li ma tagħmilx hekk.
I hope he is happy with that	Nispera li hu kuntent b'dan
I thought I’d go home	Ħsibt li mmur id-dar
That really should be.	Li verament għandu jkun.
But there was something else, too.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
Well, she knows everything.	Ukoll, hi taf kollox.
I can't wait any longer	Ma nistax nistenna aktar
That was not good for us.	Dak ma kienx tajjeb għalina.
I'm sure you did yours too	Jiena ċert li għamilt tiegħek ukoll
Which is not, in fact, wrong.	Li mhux, fil-fatt, ħażin.
I want to know everything too	Irrid inkun naf kollox ukoll
I believe it is coming for you	Nemmen li ġej għalik
I'm not sure how this will work.	M'inix ċert kif dan se jaħdem.
I don’t know enough, he thought.	Ma nafx biżżejjed, ħaseb.
It doesn't seem to work.	Ma jidhirx li jaħdem.
But she didn’t know it.	Imma hi ma kinitx taf dan.
I didn’t even do anything	Jien lanqas għamilt xejn
It looked like years.	Deher qisu snin.
That was it now.	Dan kien issa.
She is not the only one.	Hi mhix l-unika waħda.
I won’t say much about it here.	Mhux se ngħid ħafna dwar dan hawn.
I love being yours	Inħobb li huma tiegħek
It makes you more like everyone else.	Jagħmel inti aktar bħal kulħadd.
There is nothing we can do about it now.	M'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu dwar dan issa.
I was busy pretty late	Jien kont okkupat pjuttost tard
I wish it was that easy	Nixtieq li kien daqshekk faċli
She was not seen.	Hija ma kinitx tidher.
And more than that really.	U aktar minn hekk verament.
I didn’t want to tell you	Ma ridtx ma ngħidlek
I couldn’t be happier	Ma stajtx inkun aktar ferħan
If something happens.	Jekk jiġri xi ħaġa.
I often loved it	Ħafna drabi kont inħobb
She had done it.	Hija kienet għamlet dan.
I have to do that.	Ikolli nagħmel hekk.
Or live here.	Jew jgħix hawn.
I had it happened to me before.	I kien jiġri lili qabel.
I hope that was the truth	Jien nittama li dik kienet il-verità
He was.	Huwa kien.
And he will.	U hu se.
I can't see anything	Jien ma nkun nista’ nara xejn
I still wasn't sure this was a good idea	Għadni ma kontx ċert li din kienet idea tajba
I wasn't worried about who might see it once	Ma kontx inkwetat dwar min jista’ jkun qed jara darba
Only one man.	Raġel wieħed biss.
I couldn’t believe it, neither did she	Ma stajtx nemmen, lanqas hi
This is probably wrong.	Dan probabbilment huwa ħażin.
And it won’t be good either.	U mhux se jkun tajjeb lanqas.
Definitely would.	Żgur li kieku.
I think we can do that	Naħseb li nistgħu nagħmlu dan
And it was good.	U kien tajjeb.
But not here.	Imma mhux hawn.
I will tell you about this later	I se ngħidlek dwar dan aktar tard
I need to think this	Għandi bżonn naħseb dan
I can't do that.	Ma nistax nagħmel hekk.
We don’t have people here.	M'għandniex nies hawn.
And it’s good, for me.	U huwa tajjeb, għalija.
I know I wanted to talk	Naf li ridt titkellem
I had no chance.	Ma kelli l-ebda ċans.
We don’t have time for that.	M'għandniex ħin għal dan.
You need great help.	Għandek bżonn għajnuna kbira.
That’s just what we do.	Dak hu biss dak li nagħmlu.
I was very worried about this problem	Kont inkwetat ħafna dwar din il-problema
What happened we will probably never know.	X'ġara x'aktarx qatt ma nkunu nafu.
I wanted more.	Ridt aktar.
Well, they are back.	Ukoll, huma lura.
I’m the one who knows everything that happened before.	Jien dak li naf dak kollu li għadda qabel.
I needed to think fast	Kelli bżonn naħseb malajr
I know everything, I see everything and I hear everything	Naf kollox, nara kollox u nisma’ kollox
I heard everything	Smajt kollox
I'm not sure about that	M'inix ċert dwar dan
I'm not sure where.	M'inix ċert fejn.
I, myself, will surely be doing so	Jien, jien, żgur li se nkun qed nagħmel hekk
I can't say more.	Ma nistax ngħid aktar.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow.	Forsi mhux illum, forsi mhux għada.
Maybe she knows something.	Forsi hi taf xi ħaġa.
The last becomes the first.	L-aħħar isir l-ewwel.
You know everyone looked like he was so good.	Taf li kulħadd kien qisu kien daqshekk tajjeb.
Really, really easy.	Verament, tassew faċli.
Many people like this.	Ħafna nies bħal dan.
I often loved it.	Ħafna drabi kont inħobb.
I was still in school.	Kont għadni l-iskola.
Not to be sure.	Mhux biex tkun ċert.
Nothing needs to happen.	Ma jeħtieġ li jiġri xejn.
But there will be another.	Imma se jiġi ieħor.
Sure, let’s go.	Żgur, ejja mmorru.
I had to be scared	I kellha tkun jibża
This felt great.	Dan ħassu kbir.
I need to talk to you	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek
That’s what’s actually happening.	Dak hu li fil-fatt qed jiġri.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan.
It was a good time for everyone	Ġie żmien tajjeb minn kulħadd
Now I was sure of it.	Issa kont ċert minn dan.
I can’t just stay home	Ma nistax biss noqgħod id-dar
I think it’s great.	Naħseb li huwa kbir.
Maybe this book will help a little.	Forsi dan il-ktieb jgħin xi ftit.
I can see that happening again	Nista’ nara li jerġa’ jiġri
I'm not happy with you right now.	Jien mhux kuntent miegħek bħalissa.
He would know now.	Kien ikun jaf issa.
I am very glad that all this is happening	Jien ferħan ħafna li qed jiġri dan kollu
I hope we are good here	Nispera li nkunu tajjeb hawn
He was a very good friend of mine.	Huwa kien ħabib tajjeb ħafna tiegħi.
It hadn’t been yet, but it was going to be, and soon.	Kien għadu ma kienx, imma kien se jkun, u dalwaqt.
I'm worried about it.	Jien inkwetat dwarha.
Or maybe she just knew.	Jew forsi kienet taf biss.
I wonder how to do that	Nistaqsi kif tagħmel dan
I just wanted to be happy	Ridt biss inkun kuntent
That's it, and much more.	Huwa dak, u ħafna aktar.
Tonight for us.	Illejla għalina.
Many have now.	Ħafna għandhom issa.
Don't even try to talk.	Lanqas biss ipprova jitkellem.
You are too young.	Inti żgħir wisq.
I wonder where he lives	Nistaqsi fejn jgħix
And don't say 'we'.	U mhux ngħid ‘aħna’.
A little, but not so much.	Ftit, imma mhux daqshekk.
He became my good friend.	Huwa sar ħabib tajjeb tiegħi.
I don't want to say anything	Jien ma rrid ngħid xejn
I really need to understand how this works.	Għandi verament bżonn nifhem kif jaħdem dan.
I have one.	Jien għandi waħda.
I had to be a friend	I kellha tkun ħabib
I didn’t think all that had already happened	Ma kontx naħseb li dak kollu li kien diġà ġara
Not everything is what you think it is.	Mhux kollox huwa dak li taħseb li jkun.
I really didn’t have to.	Verament ma kellix għalfejn.
I never thought about it that way.	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha hekk.
That’s what we’re going to do here.	Dak se nagħmlu hawn.
I know you are telling the truth	Naf li qed tgħid il-verità
I came here to do this.	Ġejt hawn biex nagħmel dan.
One is wrong.	Wieħed huwa ħażin.
I know it doesn’t look that way now	Naf li ma jidhirx hekk issa
You say you see.	Tgħid tara.
After that, for a while, things got better.	Wara dan, għal xi żmien, l-affarijiet kienu aħjar.
Nothing more is mine.	Xejn aktar hija tiegħi.
He got what he wanted.	Ħa dak li ried.
I will definitely do this again.	Żgur li se nerġa' nagħmel dan.
It is working as it was before.	Qed jaħdem kif kien qabel.
But the two together do.	Imma t-tnejn flimkien jagħmlu.
I said, of course.	għidt, ovvjament.
I don’t know exactly why this would be.	Ma nafx eżatt għaliex dan ikun.
I’m worried about what you’re doing to me.	Jien inkwetat dwar x'qed tagħmel miegħi.
I hope it goes well for you.	Nittama li jmur tajjeb għalik.
I needed to think about that as well	Kelli bżonn naħseb dwar dan ukoll
I know where I'm going	Naf fejn sejjer
And it probably should be, too.	U probabbilment għandu jkun, ukoll.
It may help.	Jista 'jgħin.
It was after morning.	Kien wara minn filgħodu.
Only with you.	Biss miegħek.
I hope it’s good.	Nispera li hu tajjeb.
I have no problem with that.	M'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan.
I probably knew before he did	Probabbilment kont naf qabel ma għamel
Before you are big, you have to be good.	Qabel ma tkun kbir, trid tkun tajjeb.
It couldn't be.	Ma setax ikun.
It was never there.	Qatt ma kien hemm.
Maybe a little more.	Forsi ftit aktar.
This was not something to try.	Din ma kinitx xi ħaġa li wieħed ipprova.
I think maybe she was right	Naħseb li forsi kellha raġun
I couldn’t believe this happened to me	Ma stajtx nemmen li dan ġara lili
Often, this is not a big problem.	Ħafna drabi, din mhix problema kbira.
It just seems like you’re supposed to do something.	Jidher biss li suppost tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I couldn’t understand why no one was doing this	Ma stajtx nifhem għaliex ħadd ma kien qed jagħmel dan
I just want to be me	Irrid inkun jien biss
More time than we need, really.	Aktar ħin milli għandna bżonn, tassew.
There is no other way, really.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor, tassew.
I had a lot of time alone	Kelli ħafna ħin waħdi
Pretty good, actually.	Pjuttost tajjeb, fil-fatt.
Or at work.	Jew fuq ix-xogħol.
Not that it would be very helpful.	Mhux li kienet tkun ta’ għajnuna kbira.
I hope you had a good one	Nispera li kellek waħda tajba
And she is not here.	U hi ma tkunx hawn.
Who knew how big it was, but something.	Min kien jaf kemm hu kbir, imma xi ħaġa.
I seem to be taking a lot of these lately	Jidher li qed nieħu ħafna minn dawn dan l-aħħar
And not just a chance.	U mhux biss ċans.
Or it may not be.	Jew jista 'ma jkunx.
And maybe he had gone too long.	U forsi kien ilu mar wisq.
But he is here.	Imma hu qiegħed hawn.
I was waiting forever	Kont nistenna għal dejjem
I wasn't happy either	Jien ukoll ma kontx kuntent
I made it all happen	Għamilt dan kollu jiġri
I can't prove it.	Ma nistax nipprova dan.
Maybe you can tell me.	Forsi tkun tista’ tgħidli.
It was done for me.	Kien sar għalija.
I could hardly believe it	Kważi ma stajtx nemmen
I just wanted to be with you	Ridt biss inkun miegħek
I could see what he was thinking	Stajt nara x’kien qed jaħseb
Alone.	Waħdek.
Until recently this is.	Sa ftit ilu dan hu.
And another one.	U wieħed ieħor.
Maybe just a few were	Forsi ftit biss kienu
It’s not too long for him.	Hija ma tantx twil għalih.
Already, it was too late.	Diġà, kien tard wisq.
I just need to be alone	Għandi bżonn biss li nkun waħdi
He was fine.	Huwa kien tajjeb.
I did so.	Għamilt hekk.
What he needed was to eat.	Li kellu bżonn kien li jiekol.
I didn’t think it would ever be so bad	Ma kontx naħseb li qatt se tkun daqshekk ħażina
He seems very interested.	Jidher interessat ħafna.
No one needed to know about it.	Ħadd ma kellu bżonn ikun jaf dwar dan.
It actually seems to work.	Fil-fatt jidher li jaħdem.
I need to go back outside	Għandi bżonn li tmur lura barra
I can't do more things	Ma nistax nagħmel aktar affarijiet
The truth is, he will never be happy.	Il-verità hi li qatt mhu se jkun kuntent.
I can't right now.	Ma nistax bħalissa.
And that was outside of me	U dak kien barra tiegħi
I can see that.	Jien nista' nara dan.
I understand a little, and that is enough	Nifhem ftit, u dan huwa biżżejjed
I think this is just a thing for him	Naħseb li din hija biss ħaġa għalih
She probably never knew.	Hija probabbilment qatt ma tkun taf.
One is that.	Waħda hija dik.
I would like to take this time to say	Nixtieq nieħu dan iż-żmien biex ngħid
I think it turned out really well.	Naħseb li ħareġ tassew tajjeb.
If this can happen once, it will surely happen again.	Jekk dan jista 'jiġri darba, żgur li jista' jerġa 'jiġri.
You might think so.	Inti tista 'taħseb hekk.
I believe I can do the same for you	Nemmen li tista’ tagħmel l-istess għalik
Maybe I will as well.	Forsi se nagħmel hekk ukoll.
I didn’t want to, either	Jien ma ridtx, lanqas
I didn't know what to do	Ma kontx naf x’se nagħmlu
I had the same problem	Kelli l-istess problema
It would never have been so.	Qatt ma kien ikun hekk.
Am I me? 	Jien jien?
I never knew it would happen so quickly	Qatt ma kont naf li jista’ jiġri hekk malajr
I never wanted to be one	Qatt ma ridt inkun wieħed
I like things like that	Inħobb affarijiet bħal dawn
I almost believe you	Kważi nemmen inti
I never thought that	Qatt ma ħsibt li
I didn’t really have anything to say	Ma kellix verament xi ngħid
I always will.	Jien dejjem se.
Like who you are.	Bħal min int.
I wanted to talk to you alone	Ridt nitkellem miegħek waħdi
I'm still sorry for him	Għadni jiddispjaċini għalih
A little more than a child, than it seems.	Ftit aktar minn tifel, milli jidher.
You also want to see what you eat.	Trid ukoll tara dak li tiekol.
Not good enough today.	Mhux tajjeb biżżejjed illum.
He had to be back a long time ago.	Huwa kellu jkun lura twil ilu.
It's been a long time coming	Ilni żmien mhux ħażin
I was the first to see this	Jien kont l-ewwel wieħed li rajt dan
He never thought she would actually do that.	Hu qatt ma ħaseb li fil-fatt kienet se tagħmel dan.
And there is no one around.	U m'hemm ħadd madwar.
And you knew it would.	U kont taf li kieku.
I’m glad with a friend.	Jien ferħan bi ħabib.
They are for him.	Huma għalih.
Only, really.	Biss, tassew.
I won’t say quite everything.	Mhux se ngħid pjuttost kollox.
He didn't tell anyone.	Ma qal lil ħadd.
It will not be so with you.	Mhux se jkun hekk miegħek.
I was never happy	Qatt ma kont ferħan
I just have to take some time	Ikolli biss nieħu ftit ħin
As sure today.	Bħal żgur illum.
He was so glad.	Kien tant ferħan.
Everything had to go big.	Kollox kellu jmur kbir.
Everything works fine beforehand.	Kollox jaħdem tajjeb qabel.
The only thing to do.	L-unika ħaġa li għandek tagħmel.
I think we have time for that	Naħseb li għandna ħin għal dan
He was my good husband once.	Kien raġel tajjeb tiegħi darba.
It seemed like no one did.	Deher li ħadd ma għamel.
I want to talk to him later	Irrid nitkellem miegħu wara
It took a while, but so it happened.	Ħa ftit, imma hekk ġara.
I had to do something myself	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa jien
I have to do something	Għandi nagħmel xi ħaġa
I’m trying to understand how this works	Qed nipprova nifhem kif dan jaħdem
I was already gone	Diġà kont mort
I wanted it.	Ridt li.
So it must be.	Hekk għandu jkun.
I heard about it.	Smajt dwar dan.
And not bad.	U mhux ħażin.
I need to know where I went	Għandi bżonn inkun naf fejn mort
I don’t think about it	Jien ma naħseb dwarha
That would be something.	Dik kienet tkun xi ħaġa.
Well, that was nothing, nothing.	Ukoll, dan kien xejn, xejn.
I can't say more	Ma nistax ngħid aktar
Not well.	Mhux ukoll.
I never thought about it, actually	Qatt ma ħsibt dwarha, fil-fatt
Just a few hours, he thought.	Ftit sigħat biss, ħaseb.
I had to say something	Kelli ngħid xi ħaġa
About the time he had to get to work.	Dwar iż-żmien li kellu jasal jaħdem.
But we're very close to each other.	Imma aħna qed madwar xulxin ħafna.
But he's out there.	Imma hu hemm barra.
But maybe that was a good thing.	Imma forsi dik kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
That should work.	Dak għandu jaħdem.
No, not everyone.	Le, kulħadd le.
I needed to be ready.	Kelli bżonn inkun lest.
I loved it that way.	Jien kont inħobb hekk.
I knew who she was seeing	Kont naf lil min kienet qed tara
I never wanted to be here	Jien qatt ma ridt hawn
I couldn't talk anymore	Ma stajtx nitkellem aktar
But not tonight.	Imma mhux illejla.
I never knew.	Qatt ma kont naf.
I just didn’t have that	I biss ma kellix dak
I would never say that.	Jien qatt ma ngħid hekk.
I want to do something like that	Nixtieq nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik
I know you can do the same	Naf li tista’ tagħmel l-istess
He never, ever, ever did.	Hu qatt, qatt, qatt ma għamel.
He did not want to leave.	Ma kienx ried jitlaq.
I wanted my time with him	Ridt il-ħin tiegħi miegħu
Not much you can do about it.	Mhux wisq tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
I can't do that again	Ma nistax nerġa' jiġri hekk
You have everything.	Għandek kollox.
I just need time to think	Għandi bżonn biss ħin biex naħseb
I was hoping but had no idea	Jien kont nittama imma ma kellix idea
I believe I was going about it all wrong	Nemmen li kont qed tmur dwar dan kollu ħażin
I would like to believe.	Nixtieq nemmen.
He would stay there again.	Kieku jibqa' hemm mill-ġdid.
I didn’t want to know.	Ma ridtx inkun naf.
I just couldn't see anything	I biss ma stajt nara xejn
You are nothing much.	Inti xejn ħafna.
I can’t believe what just happened	Ma nistax nemmen dak li għadu kif ġara
I wonder how much she knows	Nistaqsi kemm hi taf
This is not the first time he has done such a thing.	Din mhix l-ewwel darba li għamel ħaġa bħal din.
No, you have to do it first.	Le, trid tagħmel dan l-ewwel.
I couldn't understand what he was saying	Ma stajtx nifhem dak li kien qed jgħid
He did, no problem.	Huwa għamel, mingħajr problema.
Just on and on and on.	Biss fuq u fuq u fuq.
Not until now.	Mhux sa issa.
I just need to do these things on my own	Għandi biss bżonn nagħmel dawn l-affarijiet waħdi
Maybe you are, maybe you are not.	Forsi int, forsi m'intix.
I thought he was gone	Ħsibt li kien mar
He had to take help.	Kellu jieħu l-għajnuna.
Both are the same.	It-tnejn huma l-istess.
Not everyone was able to do that.	Mhux kulħadd kien kapaċi jagħmel dan.
Something he saw.	Xi ħaġa li ra.
You just can’t do that.	Biss ma tistax tagħmel dan.
I hope all is well	Nittama li kollox ikun tajjeb
One was staying and one was not staying.	Wieħed kien joqgħod u wieħed ma kienx joqgħod.
I’m not doing that.	Jien mhux qed nagħmel dan.
I couldn’t even sit at home.	Jien lanqas stajt noqgħod bilqiegħda d-dar.
I did something fast	Jien għamilt xi ħaġa malajr
She won't want to.	Hi mhux se trid.
A little late, but late always better than ever	Xi ftit tard, imma tard dejjem aħjar minn qatt qabel
I wasn’t worried about what was going on	Ma kontx inkwetat dwar dak li kien qed jiġri
I had to do something	Kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa
But there had to be a better way.	Imma kellu jkun hemm mod aħjar.
I want you to do something for me.	Irrid li tagħmel xi ħaġa għalija.
I'll be back in a few hours	Se nkun lura fi ftit sigħat
I needed it a lot.	Jien kelli bżonn ħafna.
I have to be able to understand	Għandi nkun kapaċi nifhem
I wonder how it looks.	Nistaqsi kif tidher.
There is only.	Hemm biss.
I look forward to being with you	Nistenna li nkun miegħek
More on this here.	Aktar dwar dan hawn.
I couldn’t take anything with me	Ma stajt nieħu xejn miegħi
I wasn't expecting it	Ma kontx qed nistenna
He may not have been here.	Jista’ jkun li ma kienx hawn.
I think he plans to talk to you	Naħseb li qed jippjana li jitkellem miegħek
I want to be us.	Irrid inkun aħna.
I was trying to do my job	Kont qed nipprova nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi
For this time.	Għal dan iż-żmien.
And, so it happened.	U, hekk ġara.
I wonder who it might be	Nistaqsi min jista’ jkun
I know a lot of things, you know	Naf ħafna affarijiet, taf
I wasn’t the only one who had appeared	Jien ma kontx l-uniku wieħed li kien deher
Failure to do so will not work.	Jekk ma tagħmilx dan mhux se jaħdem.
And it was wrong there.	U kien ħażin hemmhekk.
I can't tell you now	Ma nistax ngħidlek issa
I wasn’t sure how this was done	Ma kontx ċert kif dan sar
He would know.	Kien ikun jaf.
I have to do well	Ikolli nagħmel tajjeb
I'm yours and we're one	Jien tiegħek u aħna wieħed
It's just a little more.	Huwa biss ftit aktar.
I was quite surprised	Kont pjuttost sorpriż
I didn’t know where he was	Ma kontx naf fejn kien
Nor is that all.	Lanqas dan huwa kollu.
She had done more than that.	Kienet għamlet aktar minn hekk.
But she knew one thing.	Imma hi kienet taf ħaġa waħda.
I knew he had me.	Kont naf li kellu lili.
When it is good to do so.	Meta jkun tajjeb li tagħmel hekk.
There is nothing.	M'hemm xejn.
Not me, of course.	Mhux jien, ovvjament.
Not that he ever knew that.	Mhux li qatt kien jaf hekk.
I understand everything now	Nifhem kollox issa
It wasn’t that hard to do.	Ma kienx daqshekk diffiċli li tagħmel.
We will not be able to.	Aħna mhux se nkunu kapaċi.
There will be people you know.	Ikun hemm nies li taf.
He can get as far as he wants.	Jista’ jasal sa fejn irid.
I didn't think you would be interested	Ma kontx naħseb li inti tkun interessat
It could have been someone.	Seta’ kien xi ħadd.
It was not so.	Ma kienx hekk.
We were too.	Konna wisq.
I really didn't want to go home	Verament ma ridtx immur id-dar
I didn’t tell anyone	Jien ma għedt lil ħadd
He was so right.	Kien daqshekk raġun.
I think it might work.	Naħseb li jista 'jaħdem.
I had to believe that	Kelli nemmen li
The work is still too early for this.	Ix-xogħol għadu kmieni wisq għal dan.
I'm not sure he knows	M'inix ċert li jaf
I still couldn't believe anything was happening	Għadni ma stajtx nemmen li kien qed jiġri xejn
I didn’t know it was going to happen	Ma kontx naf li se jiġri
And a boy was great.	U tifel kien kbir.
Nor is she.	U lanqas hi.
They probably won’t do any of it.	X'aktarx ma jagħmlu l-ebda waħda.
She was making money.	Kienet tagħmel flus.
I was doing a good job as well	Jien kont qed nagħmel xogħol tajjeb ukoll
I thought a lot about it	Ħsibt ħafna dwar dan
That was the problem here.	Dik kienet il-problema hawn.
I think we have a good chance	Naħseb li għandna ċans tajjeb
We have a lot of things around my work.	Għandna ħafna affarijiet madwar ix-xogħol tiegħi.
I wasn’t sure exactly what was going on	Ma kontx ċert eżatt x'kien qed jiġri
I really want to know	Verament irrid inkun naf
I haven’t thought about that book in years	Ilni snin ma naħseb dwar dak il-ktieb
That was about three hours ago.	Dan kien madwar tliet sigħat ilu.
I heard almost everything	Smajt kważi kollox
That's all fun.	Dak kollu gost.
Or, it wasn’t.	Jew, ma kienx.
It is what we need.	Huwa dak li għandna bżonn.
I am ready to go back by tomorrow morning	Jiena lest lura sa għada filgħodu
Sometimes he had a friend with him.	Xi drabi kellu miegħu ħabib.
Too much time and money.	Wisq ħin u flus.
I wasn’t going to do that	Jien ma kontx se nagħmel hekk
I had no more	Jien ma kellix aktar
She doesn’t seem to have been there.	Hija ma jidhirx li kien hemm.
I think that will be enough	Naħseb li se jkun biżżejjed
Usually, this would be a good thing.	Normalment, din kienet tkun xi ħaġa tajba.
It was there before.	Kien hemm qabel.
I have enough money.	Għandi flus biżżejjed.
I love our time every year	Inħobb iż-żmien tagħna kull sena
You can do anything.	Tista' tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I was so worried.	Kont tant inkwetat.
I didn’t know anything.	Jien ma kont naf xejn.
That will never be.	Dak qatt mhu se jkun.
I was like that.	Jien kont hekk.
This works well enough for me.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb biżżejjed għalija.
Definitely not today.	Żgur li mhux illum.
You can't do anything.	Ma tistax tagħmel xejn.
He was for something.	Huwa kien għal xi ħaġa.
I know how she is	Naf kif hi
You must be together.	Int trid tkun flimkien.
It was hard not to.	Kien diffiċli li ma.
I just wasn’t there for that tonight	I biss ma kontx għal dak illejla
It seems to do.	Jidher li jagħmel.
I still can’t believe it, really.	Għadni ma nistax nemmen, tassew.
Be the first.	Ikun l-ewwel.
This can happen.	Dan jista' jiġri.
I have been with you	Jien ilni miegħek
It was too much.	Kienet wisq.
I know all about it	Naf kollox dwar dan
Everyone was leaving.	Kulħadd kien qed jitlaq.
I had some time to go shopping	Kelli ftit ħin biex immur nixtri
He was my friend.	Kien ħabib tiegħi.
Something we have to do.	Xi ħaġa li għandna nagħmlu.
Everyone knows everyone.	Kulħadd jaf lil kulħadd.
I think so.	Jien naħseb hekk.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Wasal iż-żmien li inti tmur it-tnejn.
I didn’t really know why	Ma kontx verament naf għaliex
There are many things we can do here.	Hemm ħafna affarijiet li nistgħu nagħmlu hawn.
I think this is happening to a lot of people	Naħseb li dan qed jiġri ma' ħafna nies
I am so glad you came back to me	Jien kuntent ħafna li ġejt lura għandi
I shouldn’t say so.	M'għandix ngħid hekk.
I still can't see outside	Għadni ma nistax nara barra
I need some help	Għandi bżonn nieħu xi għajnuna
I can’t believe you do this to me	Ma nistax nemmen li inti tagħmel dan miegħi
I had to try something.	Kelli nipprova xi ħaġa.
You’re not the only one, you know.	M'intix l-uniku wieħed, taf.
This was not working.	Dan ma kienx qed jaħdem.
I could go home	Stajt immur id-dar
I doubt everything	Niddubita kollox
It’s great that you did the same thing.	Huwa kbir li inti għamilt l-istess ħaġa.
I was just a man who said, everyone	Kont biss raġel li qal, kulħadd
No one else around.	Ħadd ieħor madwar.
I have no idea why or how or anything.	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex jew kif jew xejn.
I can’t wait here	Ma nistax noqgħod nistenna hawn
I can't tell you how much.	Ma nistax ngħidlek kemm.
He didn’t have to wait long.	Ma kellux għalfejn jistenna ħafna.
You don’t need to know now.	M'għandekx bżonn tkun taf issa.
It's where you are now.	Huwa fejn int issa.
I just want to go home.	Irrid biss immur id-dar.
It's yours.	Hi tiegħek.
I had never seen it.	Qatt ma kont rajt.
I’ve been like this for a long time	Jien kont hekk għal żmien twil
I think he knew better	Naħseb li kien jaf aħjar
And it will be yours.	U se tkun tagħmel tiegħek.
I think it wasn’t that bad	Naħseb li ma kienx daqshekk ħażin
Me, and me alone.	Jien, u jien biss.
I’m telling you to sit down.	Qed ngħidlek toqgħod bilqiegħda.
And it still is today.	U għadu llum.
It had to be.	Kellu jkun.
Maybe it is.	Forsi huwa.
Also, I wanted more time.	Barra minn hekk, ridt aktar ħin.
I was being a person	Kont qed inkun persuna
It will be difficult.	Se tkun diffiċli.
He will be back in no time.	Huwa ser ikollu lura fi ftit ħin.
It's easier for me.	Huwa aktar faċli għalija.
I was really happy.	Kont tassew kuntent.
I have, this is a way	Għandi, dan huwa mod
I probably shouldn't have told you any of this	Probabbilment m'għandi nkun qed ngħidlek xejn minn dan
It looks like years ago.	Jidher qisu snin ilu.
We both know he did, and why he did it.	It-tnejn nafu li hekk għamel, u għaliex mar.
The morning will be better.	Filgħodu se jkun aħjar.
The only one.	L-uniku wieħed.
Not sure anyone is watching this.	Mhux ċert li xi ħadd qed jara dan.
A car is a car.	Karozza hija karozza.
Well, we don’t need it anymore.	Ukoll, m'għandniex bżonn aktar.
I know he was your friend	Naf li kien ħabib tiegħek
I think it’s time.	Naħseb li wasal iż-żmien.
I would like to see more of this.	Nixtieq nara aktar minn dan.
It's so hard.	Huwa daqshekk diffiċli.
He saw nothing that evening.	Ma ra xejn dik il-lejla.
I didn't really know what to say	Ma kontx verament naf x’se ngħid
I have no idea what it was.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'kien.
I know who you are.	Naf min int.
Maybe that helps.	Forsi dan jgħin.
Something else to think about.	Xi ħaġa oħra biex taħseb.
I heard so.	Smajt hekk.
I’ve always said that’s what it is	Dejjem għedt li huwa dak li hu
I thought this would work	Ħsibt li dan se jaħdem
I think it would be very helpful	Naħseb li jkun ta’ għajnuna kbira
You have to sit down, ’he said.	Għandek toqgħod bilqiegħda,’ qal.
I'm sure it will do well.	Jien ċert li se tagħmel tajjeb.
I can't tell you more than that	Ma nistax ngħidlek aktar minn hekk
I’ve never done this before ever	Qatt ma għamilt dan qabel qatt
She didn't tell me.	Hija ma tgħidli.
No it's not like that.	Le mhux bħal dan.
He had to think.	Kellu jaħseb.
Obviously, we will not do that.	Ovvjament, mhux se nagħmlu dan.
It would have been otherwise.	Kieku kien mod ieħor.
That was for sure.	Dak kien żgur.
It would be good for him.	Ikun tajjeb għalih.
I only knew one thing	Kont naf ħaġa waħda biss
I think everyone is ready to come home.	Naħseb li kulħadd lest jiġi d-dar.
I can't do that here	Ma nistax nagħmel dan hawn
It has to be first.	Għandu jkun l-ewwel.
This is the first time he has done this.	Din hija l-ewwel darba li għamel dan.
It only takes time.	Dan jieħu biss iż-żmien.
I thought about it	Ħsibt dwar dan
Not going.	Mhux sejjer.
I didn’t really want him to survive	Ma ridtx tassew li jgħix
Both my size yours.	Kemm tiegħi daqs tiegħek.
I can't say more	Ma nistax ngħid aktar
Unless she did something.	Sakemm ma tkunx għamlet xi ħaġa.
It seemed like forever.	Deher qisu għal dejjem.
It may not be you.	Jista 'ma jkunx int.
I think that would have been good.	Naħseb li kien ikun tajjeb.
If it could be, it would be.	Kieku jista 'jiġi, ikun.
It’s not me to ask.	Mhux jien li nistaqsi.
I wasn’t really thinking about it	Ma kontx verament naħseb dwar dan
I hope you can eat a little.	Jien nittama li tista’ tiekol ftit.
He is who you are.	Huwa min int.
He saw nothing and no one.	Ma ra xejn u ħadd.
Maybe it was.	Forsi kien.
I can't tell you what it is	Ma nistax ngħidlek x'inhu
I'm too scared.	Jien nibża’ wisq.
You can go there.	Tista' tmur hemm.
I didn’t have a chance to say much more	Ma kellix ċans ngħid ħafna aktar
We had one before now.	Kellna waħda qabel issa.
I need to think about it.	Għandi bżonn naħseb dwarha.
A man is not supposed to need much	Raġel mhux suppost jeħtieġ ħafna
Maybe tomorrow evening.	Forsi għada filgħaxija.
I need to think fast	Għandi bżonn naħseb malajr
Hi who is she.	Hi min hi.
Nor would he have done otherwise.	Lanqas ma kien jagħmel mod ieħor.
Maybe it wasn't.	Forsi ma kienx.
I can say that again	Nista’ nerġa’ ngħid hekk
I can’t really talk about that	Ma nistax verament nitkellem dwar dan
He seemed to have.	Deher li kellu.
It can work.	Jista 'jaħdem.
I love everyone here	Inħobb lil kulħadd hawn
I know you don’t want to go but come on	Naf li ma tridx tmur imma ejja
There and there.	Hemm u hemm.
I always ate that way	Jien dejjem kont niekol hekk
They have to.	Għandhom.
How great that is.	Kemm hu kbir dak.
Or maybe he is.	Jew forsi hu.
He already knew that.	Dan diġà kien jaf.
I’ve always been here.	Jien dejjem kont hawn.
If you want to talk about it.	Jekk trid titkellem dwarha.
You can't do that.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan.
I need someone to stay with me	Għandi bżonn xi ħadd li jibqa’ miegħi
There is no one to see.	M'hemm ħadd x'tara.
She was there too.	Kienet hemm ukoll.
I still can’t talk to him.	Għadni ma nistax nitkellem miegħu.
All this in just over a year.	Dan kollu fi ftit aktar minn sena.
I wasn’t sure.	Jien ma kontx ċert.
I know home.	Naf id-dar.
There is only one problem.	Hemm problema waħda biss.
For me, for you.	Għalija, għalik.
He needs more.	Huwa għandu bżonn aktar.
She is not alone.	Hija mhix waħedha.
But it wasn’t and it wasn’t.	Imma ma kienx u ma kienx.
I will.	Jien se nagħmel.
I think he knows something	Naħseb li jaf xi ħaġa
I can talk to someone.	Nista’ nitkellem ma’ xi ħadd.
I couldn't see anything.	Ma stajt nara xejn.
But you are not.	Imma m'intix.
I will try to do a little of this.	Jien ser nipprova nagħmel ftit minn dan.
Which really didn’t look very good.	Li verament ma deherx tajjeb ħafna.
I'll be here.	Jien ser inkun hawn.
I was so worried.	Kont tant inkwetat.
He says he'll be fine, but he knows.	Jgħid li se jkun tajjeb, imma jaf.
And much more for that.	U ħafna aktar għal dan.
He is coming home.	Huwa ġej id-dar.
You had to be there.	Kellek tkun hemm.
I think a lot about it.	Naħseb ħafna dwar dan.
He needed to tell someone.	Kellu bżonn jgħid lil xi ħadd.
I knew what he was doing	Kont naf x’kien qed jagħmel
I didn’t want to see or do such things.	Ma ridtx li jara jew jagħmel affarijiet bħal dawn.
I was a little tired	Kont ftit għajjien
It couldn’t be.	Ma setax ikun.
I went back and forth on this.	Jien mort u lura fuq dan.
I was really alone	Jien kont verament waħdi
He had a few friends there.	Kellu ftit ħbieb hemmhekk.
It’s nothing to me.	Hi xejn għalija.
I want to know what happened here	Irrid inkun naf x'ġara hawn
You are planning something.	Qed tippjana xi ħaġa.
The car is there.	Il-karozza hemm.
It would be better.	Ikun aħjar.
There must be.	Għandu jkun hemm.
I’m afraid this happens a lot of times.	Nibża li dan jiġri ħafna drabi.
And this is great.	U dan huwa kbir.
A child can never go that far	Tifel qatt ma jkun jista’ jmur daqshekk
I can’t wait to be with him	Ma nistax nistenna li noqgħod miegħu
I was so young.	Kont tant żgħir.
Maybe it would be better if he stayed.	Forsi jkun aħjar jekk jibqa’.
I need to talk to him about work	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħu dwar xogħol
What happens is.	Dak li jiġri hu.
None of this is mine.	Xejn minn dan mhu tiegħi.
I was sure it would be fine	Kont ċert li se jkun tajjeb
I really hope so.	Tassew nittama li hekk.
It seems like a lot has been done.	Jidher li sar ħafna.
I have to really go	Ikolli verament immur
She sees things.	Hija tara l-affarijiet.
He was a pretty good man.	Kien raġel pjuttost tajjeb.
One has to try to see.	Wieħed ikollu jipprova jara.
So too in the evening.	Hekk ukoll filgħaxija.
And you don’t either.	U m'għandekx lanqas.
It may not be.	Jista 'ma jkunx.
He is a young man now.	Huwa raġel żgħir issa.
I want you to come	Irrid li tiġi
It wasn’t about.	Ma kienx madwar.
He just couldn’t do it.	Huwa biss ma setax jagħmel dan.
I couldn’t see anything better than I could	Ma stajt nara xejn aħjar milli seta
No one had to say anything.	Ħadd ma kellu jgħid xejn.
That should do it.	Dan għandu jagħmel dan.
I want to do that job	Nixtieq nagħmel dak ix-xogħol
Maybe they are right.	Forsi għandhom raġun.
I have been thinking	Ilni naħseb
We have to do what we have to do.	Irridu nagħmlu tajjeb ma’ dak li għandna.
And that's it.	U dak hemm.
He had just left.	Huwa kien għadu kif telaq.
Someone has already done so.	Xi ħadd diġà għamel hekk.
I told no one else.	għidt lil ħadd ieħor.
He had had enough of this.	Huwa kellu biżżejjed minn dan.
I have no idea how this happens.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif dan jiġri.
I couldn’t have that.	Ma setax ikolli dak.
She is not the only one.	Hi mhix l-unika waħda.
I'm sure you do.	Jien ċert li tagħmel.
He says he is.	Jgħid li hu.
Not even there.	Lanqas ma hemm.
You're a big boy now.	Int tifel kbir issa.
I hope you like it	Jien nittama li tixtieq
But it never does.	Imma qatt ma jagħmel.
I didn’t hear anything from behind	Ma smajt xejn minn wara
I try and try and try again	Nipprova u nipprova u nerġa' nipprova
So far it is working well.	Sa issa qed jaħdem tajjeb.
One of many problems.	Waħda minn ħafna problemi.
I was thinking about it around the same time	Kont qed naħseb dwarha madwar l-istess ħin
It will take many years.	Se jieħu ħafna snin.
But it looks too bad now.	Imma jidher ħażin wisq issa.
You don't want that.	Inti ma tridx hekk.
I think you had the same	Naħseb li kellek l-istess
It would have been so much easier on its own.	Kien ikun daqshekk aktar faċli waħedha.
Someone wants to.	Xi ħadd irid.
None of this is a problem.	L-ebda waħda minn dawn l-affarijiet ma hija problema.
What he had done.	Dak li kien għamel.
I never had any children.	Qatt ma kelli l-ebda tifel.
I doubt that’s the only one	Niddubita li dik hija l-unika waħda
But it is not working.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem.
Maybe you do.	Forsi int tagħmel.
I think he knows more than he says	Naħseb li jaf aktar milli qed jgħid
It does a lot of good things.	Jagħmel ħafna affarijiet tajjeb.
You don’t want someone like that.	Ma tridx xi ħadd bħal dak.
This was not going to work out.	Dan ma kienx kif suppost kellha tmur.
I knew everything I needed to know	Kont naf dak kollu li kelli nkun naf
It won’t be much.	Mhux se jkun ħafna.
I didn't know what was going on	Ma kontx naf x’qed jiġri
And there are many.	U hemm ħafna.
I needed something easier	Kelli bżonn xi ħaġa aktar faċli
I've died.	I stajt miet.
There was where it last appeared.	Kien hemm fejn deher l-aħħar.
And she certainly did.	U żgur li għamlet.
I hope you are interested	Qed nittama li tkun interessat
And she knew he knew.	U kienet taf li kien jaf.
I believe he told the truth	Nemmen li qal il-verità
I just saw everything I did	Jien biss rajt dak kollu li għamilt
I'll tell you when it's time	Jien ngħidlek meta jkun il-ħin
This is a lot.	Dan huwa ħafna.
This is probably an easy one.	Din hija probabbilment waħda faċli.
It should be, but it’s not.	Għandu jkun, imma mhux.
I was worried otherwise	Kont inkwetat mod ieħor
I had to think of that.	I kellha ħsibt ta 'dak.
That too.	Dik ukoll.
I can't say anything more.	Ma nista’ ngħid xejn aktar.
I'm sure you're capable.	Jien ċert li int kapaċi.
I have a job for you	Għandi xogħol għalik
Not so with this book.	Mhux hekk b’dan il-ktieb.
But it will do more.	Imma se tagħmel aktar.
I can’t be sure.	Ma nistax inkun ċert.
I needed a little more time	Kelli bżonn ftit aktar ħin
I don’t think I was, or wouldn’t be here	Naħseb li ma kontx, jew ma tkunx hawn
Obviously she knew.	Ovvjament kienet taf.
I didn’t know how many people there were.	Ma kontx naf kemm hemm nies.
And that would be great.	U dan ikun kbir.
Hi, hi.	Hi, hi.
He is alone.	Huwa waħdu.
I think I did, actually	Naħseb li għamilt, fil-fatt
I haven't been there in a long time	Ilni ma kont hemm
She will see that something is wrong.	Hija ser tara li xi ħaġa hija ħażina.
This was not for me.	Dan ma kienx għalija.
I think there are a few.	Naħseb li hemm ftit.
You must be here.	Trid tkun hawn.
I can't do that.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan.
He wants something.	Irid xi ħaġa.
You’ve always been too good for me.	Int dejjem kont tajjeb wisq għalija.
I know now.	Naf issa.
I can't be in love with him	Ma nistax inkun inħobb miegħu
This is how you do it.	Dan huwa kif tagħmel dan.
I was never sure	Qatt ma kont ċert
Well, not very often.	Ukoll, mhux ħafna drabi.
No, it wasn’t there.	Le, ma kienx hemm.
I just need some time	Għandi bżonn biss ftit ħin
I need to know what's going on and where	Għandi bżonn inkun naf x'qed jiġri u fejn
I don’t believe any of this.	Jien ma nemmen xejn minn dan.
I can do this for you	Jien nista' nagħmel dan għalik
I was wondering who could come back from this	Kont nistaqsi min jista’ jerġa’ lura minn dan
And that was a really good thing, actually.	U dik kienet ħaġa tassew tajba, fil-fatt.
I didn’t think it was going to be that hard really	Ma kontx naħseb li se jkun daqshekk diffiċli tassew
This is something that no one should be without.	Din hija xi ħaġa li ħadd ma għandu jkun mingħajr.
I see him.	Nara li.
I don’t know enough to say no.	Ma nafx biżżejjed biex ngħid li mhux hekk.
I knew it would come.	Kont naf li se jiġi.
I can do the job quickly	Kapaċi nagħmel ix-xogħol malajr
He is in his room.	Huwa fil-kamra tiegħu.
Whenever someone came.	Kull meta ġie xi ħadd.
It works without a problem.	Qed jaħdem mingħajr problema.
Not ready.	Mhux lest.
I love when that happens	Inħobb meta jiġri hekk
This has not always been the case.	Dan mhux dejjem kien hekk.
He can't do that.	Ma jistax jagħmel dan.
It was just, nothing more.	Kien biss, xejn aktar.
I just wanted to make my time	Ridt biss nagħmel il-ħin tiegħi
I just knew he would	Kont naf biss li kieku
I don't see anything.	ma nara xejn.
They were around.	Kienu madwar.
You have to do something.	Trid tagħmel xi ħaġa.
It will happen.	Se jiġri.
I need time alone to think	Għandi bżonn ħin waħdi biex naħseb
I really want to do that.	Irrid verament nagħmel hekk.
And it looks pretty good.	U jidher pjuttost tajjeb.
A lot more work is being done besides.	Qed isir ħafna aktar xogħol barra minn hekk.
There always seemed to be someone else around.	Dejjem deher li kien hemm xi ħadd ieħor madwar.
I understand why.	Nifhem għaliex.
I couldn’t be alone.	Ma stajtx inkun waħdi.
I think he had a lot of fun	Naħseb li ħa gost ħafna
He knows, and so do you.	Hu jaf, u hekk għandek int.
Say nothing to anyone.	Tgħid xejn lil ħadd.
A few years out, the first child would come along	Ftit snin barra, l-ewwel tifel kien jiġi flimkien
Does anyone else have this problem ?.	Xi ħadd ieħor għandu din il-problema?.
I’m trying to understand exactly what’s going on.	Qed nipprova nifhem eżatt x'qed jiġri.
I highly doubt you were eating here	Niddubita ħafna li kont qed tiekol hawn
Not so much.	Mhux daqshekk.
In fact it is not.	Fil-fatt mhuwiex.
Look at the time.	Ħares lejn il-ħin.
I wanted to believe it was.	Ridt nemmen li kien.
Not that truth.	Mhux dik il-verità.
She did no more.	Hija ma aktar.
More and more.	Aktar u aktar.
I needed to talk to someone.	Kelli bżonn nitkellem ma’ xi ħadd.
Too much of a good thing can be bad for you.	Wisq ta 'ħaġa tajba tista' tkun ħażina għalik.
Too much, really.	Wisq, tassew.
I'm sure you can.	Jien ċert li tista '.
But you see things better.	Imma tara l-affarijiet aħjar.
I needed to know what happened	Kelli bżonn inkun naf x’ġara
I have to do this	Ikolli nagħmel dan
I want to know everything that is going on	Irrid inkun naf dak kollu li qed jiġri
It is no longer visible.	Mhux qed jidher aktar.
Glad to be helpful.	Ferħan li tkun ta' għajnuna.
There is no way to say 'maybe tomorrow'.	M'hemm l-ebda mod kif tgħid 'forsi għada'.
It was such a great idea.	Kienet idea hekk kbira.
I think it’s about that.	Naħseb li huwa dwar dan.
I know he’s just about	Naf li hu biss madwar
Maybe they are right.	Forsi għandhom raġun.
He had to think fast.	Kellu jaħseb malajr.
Me too, she says.	Jien ukoll, tgħid hi.
Both, he thought.	It-tnejn, ħaseb.
Forever and ever.	Għal dejjem ta 'dejjem.
You can't tell.	Ma tistax tgħid.
But he was scared.	Imma kien jibża.
A few times in fact	Xi ftit drabi fil-fatt
Here's something you've never seen before	Hawn xi ħaġa li qatt ma ra qabel
He agreed quickly.	Huwa qabel malajr.
Our morning, its afternoon.	Filgħodu tagħna, wara nofsinhar tiegħu.
But maybe not.	Imma forsi le.
It’s not getting better.	Mhux qed isir aħjar.
I'm not sure what to do	M'inix ċert x'se nagħmel
I could understand why	Stajt nifhem għaliex
Sorry you are so worried right now	Jiddispjaċini li inti tant inkwetat bħalissa
I want to do this.	Irrid nagħmel dan.
In fact often not.	Fil-fatt ħafna drabi mhux.
I will do all these things for you	Jien se nagħmel dawn l-affarijiet kollha għalik
I was his, and he knew it	Jien kont tiegħu, u kien jaf
Dan.	Dan.
Everything else looks good.	Kollox ieħor jidher tajjeb.
I can tell you that's how you say it	Nista’ ngħidlek li hi kif tgħid int
I was expecting a man	Kont nistenna raġel
Maybe we were.	Forsi konna.
A thinking man will think nothing.	Raġel li jaħseb se jaħseb xejn.
I didn’t think he had said anything like that before	Ma kontx naħseb li kien qal xi ħaġa bħal dik qabel
She would never say such a thing	Qatt ma kienet tgħid xi ħaġa bħal din
When you do something, there is only what you do.	Meta tagħmel xi ħaġa, hemm biss dak li tagħmel.
I want to be with you.	Irrid inkun miegħek.
I have too much money	Għandi wisq flus
Here's one, and here's another.	Hawn wieħed, u hawn ieħor.
I never wanted to do that either	Lanqas qatt ma ridt nagħmel dan
It's been a long time coming	Ilni żmien mhux ħażin
But that won't work.	Imma dak mhux se jaħdem.
This should not be so difficult.	Dan m'għandux ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
I can tell you that	Nista' ngħidlek daqshekk
It was usually not difficult.	Normalment ma kienx diffiċli.
She can't be.	Hija ma tistax tkun.
We have to go back there.	Irridu lura hemm.
You can do that too.	Tista 'tagħmel dan ukoll.
I don’t think it ever will	Ma naħsibx li qatt se
But he’s busy, on something.	Imma hu okkupat, fuq xi ħaġa.
I was scared	Kont nibża’
I had to take it with me.	I kellha tieħu miegħi.
I don't know where it will come from	Ma nafx minn fejn se jiġi
I think maybe that could happen	Naħseb li forsi jista' jiġri
I can’t see why that would be so.	Ma nistax nara għaliex ikun hekk.
He never did.	Hu qatt ma għamel.
We can do that.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
I have to wait now	Ikolli nistenna issa
I didn't know exactly what to say	Ma kontx naf eżatt x’se ngħid
I hadn’t heard that before.	Dik ma kontx smajt qabel.
It will help a lot.	Se jgħin ħafna.
In fact, very good.	Fil-fatt, tajjeb ħafna.
Something wrong.	Xi ħaġa ħażina.
But so I was.	Imma hekk kont.
It was easy and good	Kienet faċli u tajba
It’s what he didn’t want here.	Hu dak li ma riedx hawn.
Not so long.	Lanqas daqshekk twil.
I really didn’t even want to	Tassew lanqas biss ridt
And it certainly was.	U żgur li kien.
Something like that.	Xi ħaġa bħal din.
If we know what we are doing.	Jekk nafu x’qed nagħmlu.
You want to know more.	Trid tkun taf aktar.
I think that's a good thing	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba
Well, now we know.	Ukoll, issa nafu.
I just didn’t say anything	Jien biss ma għedt xejn
I know it’s very long.	Naf li huwa twil ħafna.
But it won’t be for long.	Imma ma jkunx għal żmien twil.
All this we were doing.	Dan kollu konna nagħmlu aħna.
This is good to know.	Dan huwa tajjeb li tkun taf.
I was happy there.	Kont kuntent hemmhekk.
I think this looks great	Naħseb li dan jidher kbir
I can't do anything else	Jien ma nista nagħmel xejn aktar
I just know he would	Naf biss li kieku
I'll do it again.	Jien nerġa' nagħmel.
‘nothing’.	'xejn'.
I hope he does the same for you	Nittama li jagħmel l-istess għalik
I still have that book with me	Għadni dak il-ktieb miegħi
Like it never happened.	Bħal qatt ma ġara.
This happens, even today.	Dan jiġri, għadu llum.
First she had to speak.	L-ewwel kellha titkellem.
Only once, and that was a long time ago.	Darba biss, u dan kien żmien twil ilu.
I said it was good, and it was	Għidt li kien tajjeb, u kien
I want to hope that my home is still there	Irrid nittama li d-dar tiegħi għadha hemmhekk
I wasn’t worried	Ma kellix inkwetat
I actually like to be late for school	Fil-fatt inħobb noqgħod tard l-iskola
You can do this from here.	Tista' tagħmel dan minn hawn.
I always thought it was me.	Dejjem ħsibt li kont jien.
I wasn’t a great friend	Ma kontx ħabib kbir
I’m a good kid now.	Jien tifel tajjeb issa.
I know you can do that	Naf li tista’ tagħmel dan
He was very young now.	Huwa kien żgħir ħafna issa.
Please good soon.	Jekk jogħġbok tajjeb malajr.
I think it was small	Naħseb li kien żgħir
I don’t think he knew anything.	Ma naħsibx li kien jaf xejn.
No, it's not a problem.	Le, mhix problema.
I was busy otherwise	Jien kont okkupat mod ieħor
I eat things.	Jien niekol l-affarijiet.
See what's going on.	Tara x'qed jiġri.
I'm sure he would.	Jien ċert li kieku.
But it never happened.	Imma qatt ma ġara.
But here's more.	Imma hawn aktar.
I think he had fun	Naħseb li ħa gost
And it’s really pretty easy to know.	U hija verament pjuttost faċli li tkun taf.
I can’t believe they are truly mine	Ma nistax nemmen li huma tassew tiegħi
I want more than anything	Nixtieq li aktar minn kull ħaġa
A man sees.	Raġel jara.
I can’t really say more about that	Ma nistax verament ngħid aktar dwar dan
When she is here.	Meta hi hawn.
I didn’t know how he was going to do that	Ma kontx naf kif se jagħmel dan
I didn’t want to say so much	Ma kontx ridt ngħid daqshekk
I thought I was someone else	Ħsibt li kont xi ħadd ieħor
Just a little more than nothing.	Biss ftit aktar minn xejn.
I think we did that today.	Naħseb li għamilna hekk illum.
I want to know what happened	Irrid inkun naf x’ġara
This is my home now	Din hija d-dar tiegħi issa
Each lived alone.	Kull wieħed kien jgħix waħdu.
No, it would not be the same.	Le, ma jkunx l-istess.
That's more.	Li aktar.
Everyone knew, but no one saw.	Kulħadd kien jaf, imma ħadd ma ra.
This is what they do.	Dan huwa dak li jagħmlu dan.
You are very different	Inti ħafna mod ieħor
It would not be easy.	Ma jkunx faċli.
He doesn’t, and he still doesn’t.	Huwa ma, u għadu ma jagħmilx.
Why are you.	Għaliex int.
I will only take one chance	Se nieħu ċans wieħed biss
I think someone else	Naħseb xi ħadd ieħor
I didn't want anyone to know	Ma ridt li ħadd ikun jaf
Pretty sure we know who he is.	Pjuttost żgur li nafu min hu.
There is a way.	Hemm mod.
I will always be your friend	Jien u dejjem se nkun ħabib tiegħek
It really is.	Huwa tassew.
What happens here, is not what it seems.	X'inhu jiġri hawn, mhuwiex dak li jidher.
He is still a man.	Għadu raġel.
This book is for you.	Dan il-ktieb huwa għalik.
Nice thing, really	Ħaġa sabiħa, il-verità
Get out of there as fast as you can.	Ħareġ minn hemm malajr kemm seta’.
I was a little surprised	Jien kont xi ftit sorpriż
After a while, he speaks.	Wara xi żmien, titkellem.
I saw this working later	Rajt dan qed jaħdem aktar tard
You have to think about it.	Għandek taħseb fuq dan.
She will know that.	Hija se tkun taf li.
And it couldn’t be otherwise.	U ma setax ikun mod ieħor.
Now, there is something to this.	Issa, hemm xi ħaġa għal dan.
I think it will be.	Naħseb li se jkun.
I just want to do this	Irrid biss nagħmel dan
I hope you are very happy	Nispera li tkun kuntent ħafna
I need something more	Għandi bżonn xi ħaġa aktar
It didn’t look so great.	Ma kienx jidher daqshekk kbir.
And he wanted this forever.	U ried dan għal dejjem.
I was very happy.	Kont kuntent ħafna.
He will probably come home tomorrow afternoon.	Probabbilment se jiġi d-dar għada wara nofsinhar.
In fact, maybe not.	Fil-fatt, forsi le.
I should know by tomorrow	Għandi nkun naf sa għada
I haven’t done one of these in a long time	Ilni ma nagħmel waħda minn dawn
Not so long.	Mhux daqshekk twil.
Look at your dog.	Ħares lejn il-kelb tiegħek.
I really wasn't too sure about that	Verament ma kontx ċert wisq dwar dan
I’m really not having a good time	Jien verament mhux qed nagħmel ħin tajjeb
It's everything.	Huwa kollox.
She had many friends.	Kellha ħafna ħbieb.
I want you to be happy	Irrid li tkun kuntent
No one is sitting.	Ħadd mhu bilqiegħda.
I didn't even know it	Lanqas kont naf hekk
I can’t do that anymore	Ma nistax nagħmel dan aktar
She doesn't want to talk to you.	Hi ma tridx titkellem miegħek.
I can’t say he’s either	Ma nistax ngħid li hu lanqas
I didn’t have enough time	Ma kellix biżżejjed ħin
Anyone who wants to.	Kull min irid.
I want to talk to him	Irrid nitkellem miegħu
For a while no one said anything.	Għal xi żmien ħadd ma qal xejn.
It could have been.	Seta’ kien.
You and I, now.	Int u jien, issa.
I'm really sorry.	Jien tassew jiddispjaċini.
I can sit down.	I tista 'toqgħod bilqiegħda.
I think it’s a great one	Naħseb li hija waħda kbira
And that’s me.	U dak jien.
I was right too.	Jien ukoll kelli raġun.
But she wants to.	Imma hi trid.
Come now.	Ejja issa.
Big and little.	Kbir u ftit.
There is nothing more out there.	M'hemm xejn aktar hemmhekk.
I hope it stays that way	Jien nittama li jibqa’ hekk
It seems like someone actually lives here now.	Jidher li xi ħadd fil-fatt jgħix hawn issa.
It makes you see.	Jagħmel inti tara.
I didn’t know they would do that	Ma kontx naf li se jagħmlu dan
You don't do anything about it.	Inti ma tagħmel xejn dwar dan.
I didn’t think so	Jien ma kontx naħseb
Your good idea.	Idea tajba tiegħek.
I know what you need	Naf dak li għandek bżonn
It was doing.	Din kienet tagħmel.
One was not.	Wieħed ma kienx.
Here's how you can do that too.	Hawn kif tista 'tagħmel dan ukoll.
I can't hear anything	Ma nista’ nisma’ xejn
But I did a good job.	Imma għamilt xogħol tajjeb.
It's us.	Huwa magħna.
This has never been a problem.	Din qatt ma kienet problema.
It's more like you said it.	Huwa aktar bħal inti qal dan.
I know this was going to happen	Għandi naf li dan kien se jiġri
I should be back soon	Għandi nkun lura dalwaqt
Maybe that was bad enough.	Forsi dan kien ħażin biżżejjed.
He knows this, but he doesn't know how.	Jaf dan, imma ma jafx kif jaf.
Or so you think.	Jew hekk taħseb.
I wonder why this is, now.	Nistaqsi għaliex dan hu, issa.
A man was sitting there	Raġel kien bilqiegħda hemm
Something to do for me.	Xi ħaġa li għandek tagħmel għalija.
I just can’t go back	Jien biss ma nistax immur lura
It will take as long as it takes.	Se tieħu kemm tieħu.
I know it’s good for me	Naf li huwa tajjeb għalija
I was going to talk to someone else	Kont se nitkellem ma’ xi ħadd ieħor
Not well.	Mhux ukoll.
I know that too.	Jien naf hekk ukoll.
I have no way of knowing	M'għandi l-ebda mod kif inkun naf
I know what it looks like	Naf kif jidher
I will not go there again.	Jien mhux se nerġa' mmur hemm.
Not so great.	Mhux daqshekk kbir.
He knew what was going to happen.	Kien jaf x’kien se jiġri.
But no one knew exactly what it was.	Imma ħadd ma kien jaf eżatt x’kien.
I want to see what he is wearing	Irrid nara x'inhu liebes
He was a very good man to work for.	Kien raġel tajjeb ħafna biex jaħdem għalih.
I can't go back.	Ma nistax immur lura.
I just want what is mine	Irrid biss dak li hu tiegħi
I knew what was going on there	Kont naf x’ġara hemmhekk
I don’t need to know.	M'għandix bżonn inkun naf.
It's pretty beautiful.	Hija pjuttost sabiħa.
I’ve always been a bit like that	Jien dejjem kont daqsxejn hekk
No one said a thing.	Ħadd ma qal ħaġa.
He was loved.	Kien iħobb.
She does a very good job.	Hija tagħmel xogħol tajjeb ħafna.
I want to see it happen.	Nixtieq nara li jiġri.
There are no problems.	M'hemm l-ebda problemi.
Surely we can.	Żgur li nistgħu.
I didn’t know about any of this	Jien ma kont naf dwar xi ħaġa minn dan
There are a lot of people like that.	Hemm ħafna nies bħal dik.
I’m not saying anything more	Jien ma ngħid xejn aktar
In fact, you can.	Fil-fatt, tista '.
That's all.	Dak kollox .
I would like to see something very soon.	Nixtieq nara xi ħaġa malajr ħafna.
I don’t know how she did it, but she did.	Ma nafx kif għamlet dan, imma għamlet.
It always seemed that way.	Dejjem deher hekk.
Back to my door.	Lura lejn il-bieb tiegħi.
I didn’t say anything more about it	Ma għidt xejn aktar dwarha
I'm tired yet	Jien għajjien sa għadni
And we certainly did.	U dan żgur għamilna.
They're going to do something, we know that.	Huma ser jagħmlu xi ħaġa, nafu li.
I don’t want anything better.	Jien ma nixtieq xejn aħjar.
No one knows where they are.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn huma.
That was easy.	Dak kien faċli.
I can't go back there	Ma nistax immur lura hemm
He knows how it looks.	Hu jaf kif tidher.
Sometimes this was harder than other times.	Xi drabi dan kien aktar diffiċli minn drabi oħra.
I don’t actually know.	Fil-fatt ma nafx.
Not alone.	Mhux waħdu.
I can’t wait to tell the truth	Ma nistax nistenna li ngħid il-verità
This cannot be good.	Dan ma jistax ikun tajjeb.
I can’t do this alone.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan waħdi.
I didn't want to be afraid	Ma ridtx nibża’
I can't say you will	Ma nistax ngħid li inti se
He had never done anything like this before.	Hu qatt ma kien għamel xi ħaġa bħal din qabel.
And she never did.	U qatt ma għamlet.
I tell you no.	Jien ngħidlek li mhux.
No one knows this.	Ħadd ma jaf dan.
There, there is enough for everyone.	Hemm, hemm biżżejjed għal kulħadd.
I love the next week	Inħobb il-ġimgħa ta’ wara
It came together quickly.	Ġie flimkien malajr.
I'm afraid I'm going home	Nibża’ li fil-fatt mmur id-dar
And you must.	U trid.
Looks like it's coming back.	Qisu qed jerġa’ jkun hemm.
He said he wanted to talk.	Qal li ried jitkellem.
I see a lot of things.	Nara ħafna affarijiet.
Neither are you.	Lanqas int.
It should not.	M'għandux.
I couldn't go any further	Ma stajtx immur aktar
I hope yours is as good as mine	Nispera li tiegħek huwa tajjeb daqs tiegħi
To be right.	Biex tkun raġun.
I’m not just doing it for myself.	Jien mhux qed nagħmel għalija biss.
I would know if he had	Inkun naf kieku kellu
I just need to listen.	Għandi bżonn biss nisma.
I think he does.	Naħseb li jagħmel.
He needed time.	Huwa kellu bżonn iż-żmien.
I can't take everything	Ma nistax nieħu kollox
Why was this happening? 	Għaliex kien qed jiġri dan?
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
I need to try this.	Ikolli bżonn nipprova dan.
I wasn't sure what to do	Ma kontx ċert x’se jagħmel
I think it's pretty good.	Naħseb li huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
I don’t want that.	Ma rridx hekk.
He went with everyone.	Huwa mar ma’ kulħadd.
But so it happened.	Imma hekk ġara.
Everything happens so fast.	Kollox jiġri hekk malajr.
I couldn't believe this was happening again	Ma stajtx nemmen li dan kien qed jerġa’ jiġri
If.	Kieku.
Not only that.	Mhux biss.
Now he had done so.	Issa kien għamel hekk.
I need to do that	Għandi bżonn li tagħmel dan
That was what she was thinking.	Dan kien dak li kienet taħseb.
I was just really scared	I kien biss verament jibża
I think she wants it that way	Naħseb hi tixtieq hekk
This can, in fact.	Dan jista', fil-fatt.
I had the same problem.	Kelli l-istess problema.
I wouldn’t be doing anything else	Jien ma nkun qed nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra
Not for something like that.	Mhux għal xi ħaġa bħal din.
That time.	Dak il-ħin.
And this is what you should do.	U dan huwa dak li għandek tagħmel.
It's his thing, you might say.	Hija ħaġa tiegħu, tista 'tgħid.
She says she is.	Hi tgħid li hi.
It wasn't good.	Ma kienx tajjeb.
It's not right for you.	Hu mhux tajjeb għalik.
I saw a lot really	Rajt ħafna tassew
I couldn’t believe he took it	Ma stajtx nemmen li ħa
In fact, there was.	Fil-fatt, kien hemm.
I know you are not happy here	Naf li m'intix kuntent hawn
I want to know everything	Irrid inkun naf dak kollu
I didn't need any help	Ma kelli bżonn l-ebda għajnuna
That this certainly was.	Li dan żgur kien.
I thought the same thing	Ħsibt l-istess ħaġa
I’m going to prove you’re that after that	Jien se nipprova li int dak wara dan
But there it was.	Imma hemm kienet.
It looked very bad to me.	Lili deher ħażin ħafna.
I didn't hear or see anything	Ma smajt jew rajt xejn
No one was there.	Ħadd ma kien hemm.
He just walked away from there	Huwa biss telaq minn hemm
Good and bad.	Tajjeb u ħażin.
You can think.	Tista' taħseb.
It had been there for years.	Kien ilu hemm snin.
I really don’t know why that happened	Verament ma nafx għaliex ġara hekk
He didn’t need to see this.	Ma kellux bżonn jara dan.
Well, they are.	Ukoll, huma.
Well, no more.	Ukoll, mhux aktar.
And that’s good too.	U dan huwa tajjeb ukoll.
I don't know any of these things.	Jien ma naf xejn minn dan l-affarijiet.
But she is beautiful.	Imma hi sabiħa.
But you did what you had to do.	Imma int għamilt dak li kellek tagħmel.
I think you say so	Naħseb li hekk tgħid
There is nothing behind this.	M'hemm xejn wara dan.
I wasn’t sure about that	Ma kontx ċert dwar dan
I sit there for hours, I don’t think, I don’t do anything	Jien noqgħod hemm għal sigħat, ma naħseb, ma nagħmel xejn
It’s not like anything else.	Mhix bħal xi ħaġa oħra.
That too was apparent.	Dak ukoll kien jidher.
! 	!
I'll tell you what happened to me.	Jien ngħidlek x’ġara lili.
I know it won't be easy	Naf li mhux se jkun faċli
He almost can't do it.	Huwa kważi ma jistax jagħmel dan.
I knew this was coming	Kont naf li dan kien ġej
Maybe everyone said no	Forsi kulħadd qal le
I never thought this would happen	Qatt ma kont naħseb li dan jista’ jiġri
I still need more time	Għadni bżonn aktar ħin
I know what he was trying to do	Naf x’kien qed jipprova
I'm very happy.	Jien kuntent ħafna.
I know that better than many	Għandi naf li aħjar minn ħafna
He knows more.	Jaf aktar.
I said it appeared, it didn’t	Għidt deher, ma kellux
But this is wrong.	Imma dan huwa ħażin.
I had to be there for him	I kellha tkun hemm għalih
I try not to think too much about it.	Nipprova ma naħsibx wisq dwarha.
I just want to eat something	Irrid biss niekol xi ħaġa
You are too late.	Inti tard wisq.
I was pretty scared.	Jien kont nibża’ pjuttost.
They were and are.	Kienu u huma.
Don’t go back now.	Mhux tmur lura issa.
I know I saw what they were doing	Naf li rajt x’qed jagħmlu
It seemed like more people.	Deher li kien aktar nies.
I hope he is.	Nispera li se.
I hope it was more than that.	Nittama li kien aktar minn hekk.
I wish I was there	Nixtieq li kont hemm
Now it's all someone else's problem.	Issa hija kollha problema ta’ xi ħadd ieħor.
I really need to see someone	Verament għandi nara lil xi ħadd
I so hope he does	Tant nittama li jagħmel hekk
I think it would be great	Naħseb li tkun kbir
And so did you.	U hekk għamilt int.
I’m not sure how long it was, actually.	M'inix ċert kemm kien twil, fil-fatt.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
I just want to talk about it.	Irrid biss nitkellem dwarha.
I can't be what he wants me to be	Ma nistax inkun dak li jrid
That's good.	Dak hu tajjeb.
That was a lot of work.	Dan kien ħafna xogħol.
You definitely want to know.	Int żgur trid tkun taf.
But you’re not the same, either.	Imma m'intix l-istess, lanqas.
Same as ever.	L-istess kif qatt kien.
It's not what it is.	Mhuwiex dak li hu.
I don’t know exactly why.	Ma nafx eżatt għaliex.
I think it might make up for it a little bit.	Naħseb li jista' jagħmel tajjeb għal dan ftit.
But she will, later.	Imma hi se, aktar tard.
How beautiful.	Kemm tassew sabiħa.
I had to tell someone.	Kelli ngħid lil xi ħadd.
And no money for that.	U l-ebda flus għal dak.
Maybe they are right	Forsi għandhom raġun
I thought it was a lot more	Ħsibt li kien ħafna aktar
It wasn’t the first time.	Ma kinitx l-ewwel darba.
Let's just.	Ejja biss.
I can’t do such a bad thing	Ma nistax nagħmel ħaġa ħażina bħal din
I didn't want to see anyone right now	Ma ridt nara lil ħadd bħalissa
It can be very bad, it can be good.	Jista 'jkun ħażin ħafna, jista' jkun tajjeb.
I hadn’t thought about it.	Ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan.
This is good.	Dan huwa tajjeb.
Currently ,.	Bħalissa,.
I think I couldn’t take a chance on that	Naħseb li ma stajtx tieħu ċans fuq dan
She had done nothing.	Ma kienet għamlet xejn.
That's it.	Dak hu.
You never know.	Qatt ma tkun taf.
He is my friend.	Huwa ħabib tiegħi.
And it wasn’t about today.	U ma kienx dwar illum.
The first thing he would do.	L-ewwel ħaġa li kien jagħmel.
But you.	Imma int.
I hadn’t really thought about it that way	Ma kontx verament ħsibt dwarha hekk
That's what you say.	Dan huwa dak li tgħid.
I’m ready and ready	Jien lest u lest
I knew what needed to be done	Kont naf x’kien hemm bżonn isir
I think that’s about all you can say	Naħseb li dan huwa dwar dak kollu li tista 'tgħid
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
I like to know where you are.	Inħobb inkun naf fejn int.
Someone said something.	Xi ħadd qal xi ħaġa.
That wasn't such a bad idea.	Dik ma kinitx idea ħażina daqshekk.
I can't understand why	Ma nistax nifhem għaliex
I’m a teacher, after all	Jien għalliem, wara kollox
I can't say it will appear again	Ma nistax ngħid li se jerġa' jidher
If it weren’t.	Kieku ma kinitx.
I knew she wasn't going to come anymore	Kont naf li ma kinitx se tiġi aktar
And that was all he was trying to be.	U kien dak kollu li kien qed jipprova jkun.
I will really do something for you	Verament se nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik
There was something about it	Kien hemm xi ħaġa dwarha
I couldn’t believe it was all happening	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien qed jiġri dan kollu
Definitely do.	Żgur li tagħmel.
That's what happens.	Hekk jiġri.
There is nothing more we can do.	M'hemm xejn aktar li nistgħu nagħmlu.
She didn’t know she was there.	Ma kinitx taf li kien hemm.
In fact, no one really does.	Fil-fatt, ħadd ma jagħmel verament.
But there is only.	Imma hemm biss.
There was not enough time.	Ma kienx hemm biżżejjed ħin.
I want to know about this happening	Irrid inkun naf dwar dan jiġri
No, sar.	Le, sar.
She wants to know where she went.	Hija trid tkun taf fejn mar.
I knew he knew more.	Kont naf li kien jaf aktar.
I can't see anything back here	Ma nistax nara xi ħaġa lura hawn
I have done this before.	Għamilt dan qabel.
I don’t know why it’s so.	Ma nafx għaliex hu hekk.
I fully understand	Nifhem għal kollox
I was just wondering if she was here	Kont biss nistaqsi jekk kinitx hawn
I want to be something more for you	Irrid inkun xi ħaġa aktar għalik
I couldn't understand what it was	Ma stajtx nifhem x’kien
The first out is of course.	L-ewwel barra hija ovvjament.
I have to tell you this.	Ikolli ngħidlek dan.
I never do that.	Jien qatt ma nagħmel hekk.
I needed to talk to someone	Kelli bżonn nitkellem ma’ xi ħadd
But it was not so.	Imma ma kienx hekk.
I have a friend waiting a little outside	Għandi ħabib jistenna ftit barra
I’m not always that easy to be around	Jien mhux dejjem daqshekk faċli li nkun madwar
He seems interested.	Jidher interessat.
I never thought of doing anything else.	Qatt ma ħsibt li tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
Everyone is having fun	Kulħadd qed jieħu gost
This was not going to happen.	Dan ma kienx se jiġri.
I think about all that	Naħseb dwar dak kollu
I wasn’t ready and neither was she	Jien ma kontx lest u hi lanqas
I know about everything	Naf dwar kollox
Everyone wants something.	Kulħadd irid xi ħaġa.
I hadn’t thought about that.	Jien ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan.
I was so tired and needed some time alone	Kont tant għajjien u kelli bżonn ftit ħin waħdi
I'm happy for you.	Jien kuntent għalik.
I couldn’t believe she was going to do something like that	Ma stajtx nemmen li kienet se tagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik
But she’s here with me again tonight.	Imma hi hawn miegħi mill-ġdid illejla.
I hope it’s right for you.	Nispera li hu tajjeb għalik.
No one ever made any money.	Ħadd qatt ma għamel xi flus.
I thought I would go back	Ħsibt li se lura
Not at home yet.	Għadu mhux id-dar.
I have to believe something behind all this	Ikolli nemmen xi ħaġa wara dan kollu
I was so tired.	Kont tant għajjien.
It's not that hard.	Mhuwiex daqshekk diffiċli.
He had come to this.	Huwa kien wasal għal dan.
I thought this was a great idea.	Ħsibt li din kienet idea kbira.
It shouldn’t be, it was the truth after all.	M'għandux ikun, kienet il-verità wara kollox.
Nor is it anything for us what he has done to us.	Lanqas mhu xejn għalina dak li għamel magħna.
This is actually a good thing.	Din fil-fatt hija ħaġa tajba.
Just one chance.	Ċans wieħed biss.
He would stay here.	Kien jibqa' hawn.
Where it should be.	Fejn kellu jkun.
I've never had that before	Qatt ma kelli dak qabel
I was talking too fast	Kont qed nitkellem malajr wisq
I wish we could, but we can’t	Nixtieq li nistgħu, imma ma nistgħux
In addition, it should not.	Barra minn hekk, m'għandux.
He took it.	Huwa ħa.
I never wanted this for you	Jien qatt ma ridt dan għalik
But he went as far as he could.	Imma hu mar kemm jista’.
He's still like a boy.	Għadu bħal tifel.
What I did.	Dak li għamilt.
I do this with everyone	Dan nagħmel ma' kulħadd
But he wasn’t wearing it that way.	Imma ma kienx liebes hekk.
One thing for sure.	Ħaġa waħda żgur.
Like me.	Bħal miegħi.
I had no idea what had happened	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'kien ġara
Something can happen.	Jista’ jiġri xi ħaġa.
I thought it was good	Ħsibt li kien tajjeb
He knows everything that has happened and will happen.	Jaf dak kollu li ġara u se jiġri.
I may have been good at times	Jista’ jkun li kont tajjeb xi drabi
That's good for us!	Dak tajjeb magħna!.
We were there together.	Konna hemm flimkien.
I would love to be here	Inħobb ħafna li nkun hawn
It's better.	Huwa aħjar.
I will do that.	Jien se nagħmel dan.
I understand why he did what he did	Nifhem għaliex għamel dak li għamel
She had to think, there was just no time to think.	Kellha taħseb, biss ma kienx hemm ħin biex taħseb.
He told me.	Huwa qalli.
Just what we need.	Biss dak li għandna bżonn.
I was glad to sit down.	Kont ferħan li noqgħod bilqiegħda.
I had to ask someone	Kelli nistaqsi lil xi ħadd
I would like to go.	Nixtieq immur.
I don’t think it was anything.	Ma naħsibx li xejn kien.
He did not come out.	Huwa ma ħareġ.
I always want you to be happy.	Dejjem irrid li inti tkun ferħan.
There was so much about this time that she didn’t know.	Tant kien hemm dwar dan iż-żmien li ma kinitx taf.
Now we don't.	Issa aħna ma.
I had to do better.	Kelli nagħmel aħjar.
But apparently it wasn't.	Imma milli jidher ma kienx.
I couldn’t go back home	Ma stajtx immur lura d-dar
He speaks nothing	Ma jitkellem xejn
I'm not home.	Jien mhux id-dar.
Nothing was better than doing nothing.	Xejn kien aħjar milli ma tagħmel xejn.
I hear it's going well	Nisma’ li sejjer tajjeb
I don't know.	ma nafx.
We know later today.	Nafu aktar tard illum.
Now that everyone has, maybe not so much.	Issa li kulħadd għandu, forsi mhux daqshekk.
Maybe it was worth a try.	Forsi kien ta 'min jipprova.
Well, he can wait.	Ukoll, huwa jista 'jistenna.
I can be a good man to you.	Jien nista' nkun raġel tajjeb għalik.
I'm not listening or talking to you anymore	Jien m'iniex nisma' jew nitkellem miegħek aktar
It’s both of them.	Huwa t-tnejn li huma.
It was easier that way.	Kien aktar faċli hekk.
I know she won't.	Naf li hi mhux se.
I've done something.	Stajt għamilt xi ħaġa.
It’s just what you do.	Huwa biss dak li tagħmel.
I had to say so	I kellha tgħid hekk
That would be great.	Dak ikun kbir.
It’s not what you think.	Mhuwiex dak li taħseb.
I couldn’t help but do the same	Ma stajtx ma nagħmel l-istess
I’ll tell you why later	Jien ngħidlek għaliex aktar tard
I had to be home	I kellha tkun id-dar
But I wanted to go with him	Imma ridt immur miegħu
That’s not much.	Dak mhux ħafna.
I didn't think much of it	Ma tantx ħsibt
I know exactly what is going on	Naf eżatt x'qed jiġri
I have a better chance than she is	Jien għandi ċans aħjar milli hi
But maybe it should be.	Imma forsi għandu jkun.
Not after what happened.	Mhux wara dak li ġara.
Tell no one.	Għid lil ħadd.
I know where we were	Naf fejn konna
I don’t know when it will be.	Ma nafx meta se jkun.
No one had.	Ħadd ma kellu.
I am, of course.	Jien, ovvjament.
Now you can do the same.	Issa tista 'tagħmel l-istess.
One by one.	Wieħed wieħed.
I hope it’s long enough	Nispera li jkun twil biżżejjed
Really, this is something you only need to do once.	Tassew, din hija xi ħaġa li għandek bżonn tagħmel darba biss.
There was nothing you, or he, could do about it.	Ma kien hemm xejn li int, jew hu, tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
I think you really like it	Naħseb li tixtieq tassew
I do I.	Jiena nagħmel jien.
I will not buy there again	Mhux se nerġa’ nixtri hemmhekk
I do nothing	Jien ma nagħmel xejn
It's easy to see why.	Huwa faċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
I did it the first time	Għamilt l-ewwel darba
I don’t know too much.	Ma nafx wisq.
I thought this would be a good time for him	Ħsibt li dan ikun żmien tajjeb għalih
And maybe never will.	U forsi qatt ma se.
I had no idea this was going to happen	Ma kellix idea li dan kien se jiġri
You never know.	Qatt ma taf.
I have a lot of things	Jiena ħafna affarijiet
I think they should too	Naħseb li għandhom ukoll
Who knows, but this looks like a lot.	Min jaf, imma dan jidher qisu ħafna.
I’ve been thinking about this for a while	Ħsibt dwar dan għal xi żmien
If you want to go, you can go.	Jekk tixtieq tmur, tista 'tmur.
I had no idea where to go	Ma kellix idea fejn immur
The first one we did.	L-ewwel waħda għamilna.
We were there first.	Konna l-ewwel hemm.
I love when this happens.	Inħobb meta jiġri dan.
Everything you want.	Dak kollu li trid.
I’m such a person.	Jien persuna bħal din.
It wasn’t that.	Ma kienx dan.
He had seen me.	Huwa kien ra lili.
I didn't see anything	Jien ma rajt xejn
I thought he might be right	Ħsibt li jista’ jkollu raġun
I never had a chance.	Jien qatt ma kelli ċans.
Not even on mine.	Lanqas fuq tiegħi.
Looks like you had a few tonight.	Deher li kellek ftit illejla.
That was a good thing.	Din kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
He didn’t even have to be there.	Hu lanqas biss kellu jkun hemm.
Lots of time.	Ħafna ħin.
I thought I would	Ħsibt li kieku
I didn’t want to know	Ma ridtx inkun naf
I know he will do that one last time.	Naf li se tagħmel hekk din l-aħħar darba.
We know where he lives.	Nafu fejn jgħix.
There is nothing for you there.	M'hemm xejn għalik hemmhekk.
We have a lot of time.	Għandna ħafna ħin.
Maybe it wasn't.	Forsi ma kienx.
I really hope you do	Verament nittama li tagħmel
I was only there when I was alone	Kont hemm biss meta kien waħdu
I am for.	Jiena għal.
Which is not a bad thing.	Li mhix xi ħaġa ħażina.
I knew what it was	Kont naf x’kien
We have to do this.	Irridu nagħmlu dan.
I expected it to be wrong	Kont nistenna li jkun ħażin
I couldn’t eat it all	Ma stajtx niekol kollu
We did well.	Għamilna tajjeb.
You can.	Tista .
But enough is enough.	Imma biżżejjed huwa biżżejjed.
But no one else did.	Imma ħadd ieħor ma għamel.
I would be fine someday	Inkun tajjeb xi darba
It has never been so.	Qatt ma kien hekk.
I never ever buy anything.	Qatt qatt nixtri xi ħaġa.
I can't say how or when	Ma nistax ngħid kif jew meta
He loved working here.	Kien iħobb jaħdem hawn.
He had not done so.	Ma kienx għamel dan.
I don’t think there is another way.	Ma naħsibx li hemm mod ieħor.
I think everything comes next	Naħseb li ġej dak kollu li ġej
It takes a while.	Huwa jieħu ftit ħin.
I hope everything works.	Nittama li kollox jaħdem.
Come tomorrow morning.	Ejja għada filgħodu.
I'm going back home now.	Jien se mmur lura d-dar issa.
I won't know until tomorrow	Mhux se nkun naf sa għada
You are doing so well.	Inti sejjer hekk tajjeb.
I really think this will help	Verament naħseb li dan se jgħin
It is coming very fast.	Huwa ġej malajr ħafna.
We have to do something.	Irridu nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
I can already tell what's next	Diġà nista’ ngħid x’inhu ġej
I want everything to work	Irrid li kollox jaħdem
I should have known a long time ago	I kellha naf żmien twil ilu
I couldn’t believe it.	Ma stajtx nemmen.
It can’t last very long.	Ma jistax joqgħod twil ħafna.
I don’t want it to be the first time.	Ma rridx li tkun l-ewwel darba.
It shouldn't be long.	M'għandux ikun twil.
But he knew it couldn’t be.	Imma kien jaf li ma setax ikun.
I thought it was too long.	Ħsibt li kien twil wisq.
I love this job.	Inħobb dan ix-xogħol.
I had a lot of friends	Kelli ħafna ħbieb
Now ready to sit down.	Issa lest biex toqgħod bilqiegħda.
I’m not sure exactly what will happen.	M'inix ċert eżatt x'se jiġri.
You will do that, he said.	Int se tagħmel dan, qal.
Obviously I didn’t want to	Ovvjament ma ridtx
Nobody is about.	Ħadd mhu dwar.
He had not come back.	Ma kienx ġie lura.
Or nothing too much.	Jew xejn wisq.
I want to see where I'm going	Irrid nara fejn sejjer
Easy, he thought.	Faċli, ħaseb.
I'm not sure how this will work.	M'inix ċert kif dan se jaħdem.
She says she did wrong.	Tgħid li għamel ħażin.
He seemed to be going to help.	Deher li kien se jgħin.
He had gone through that as well.	Kien għadda minn hekk ukoll.
I wasn’t good enough for him	Jien ma kontx biżżejjed għalih
But please don’t.	Imma jekk jogħġbok ma tagħmilx.
I just can’t tell you why quite yet	I biss ma nistax ngħidlek għaliex pjuttost għadu
Everything was wrong with me.	Kollox kien ħażin miegħi.
I really was.	Jien tassew kont.
He was a man once.	Kien raġel darba.
I want you to go to your room	Irrid li tmur fil-kamra tiegħek
You are doing something.	Qed tagħmel xi ħaġa.
There is enough said.	Hemm biżżejjed qal.
Hard to know what it was about.	Diffiċli li tkun taf dak li kien dwar.
And no one wants that.	U ħadd ma jrid hekk.
He wasn’t there, either.	Hu ma kienx hemm, lanqas.
I had no idea he was coming here	Ma kellix idea li se jiġi hawn
I saw the following.	Rajt li ġej.
I am very happy for you.	Jien kuntent ħafna għalik.
I wanted to see if you could do that.	Ridt nara jekk tistax tagħmel dan.
I just know what it is	Naf biss dak li hu
I really didn't know	Verament ma kontx naf
Or something else out here.	Jew xi ħaġa oħra hawn barra.
I have only one male friend	Għandi ħabib raġel wieħed biss
I never said it would be easy	Qatt ma għedt li jkun faċli
I had no idea it was coming	Ma kelli l-ebda idea li kien ġej
I still don't know how it happened.	Għadni ma nafx kif ġara.
I want to know.	Irrid inkun naf.
But from time to time.	Imma minn żmien għal żmien.
It comes back around.	Jiġi lura madwar.
He didn't want to come with me.	Ma riedx jiġi miegħi.
That I know enough	Dan naf biżżejjed
I wasn’t good enough for that	Ma kontx tajjeb biżżejjed għal dan
I know a lot of people.	Naf ħafna nies.
I never had friends	Qatt ma kelli ħbieb
It seemed to work.	Deher li jaħdem.
He came to me.	Huwa wasal għandi.
If he were here.	Kieku kien hawn.
I'm not going	Mhux sejjer
I mean, she doesn’t do a bad job	Irrid ngħid, hi ma tagħmilx xogħol ħażin
It's a little out there.	Huwa ftit hemmhekk.
He was right.	Kellu raġun.
There was just another way to do it.	Kien hemm biss mod ieħor kif tagħmel dan.
I couldn't do anything else	Ma stajt nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra
I thought about it a little more	Ħsibt dwarha ftit aktar
I know too many things	Naf wisq affarijiet
I knew that enough	Dan kont naf biżżejjed
I have been waiting for a year	Ilni sena nistenna
Well, so be it.	Ukoll, hekk ikun.
My friend here.	Ħabib tiegħi hawn.
Nothing good about it.	Xejn dwarha tajjeb.
I just want to be here	Irrid inkun hawn biss
I really want to go home	Irrid verament immur id-dar
He had more time to work this out.	Huwa kellu aktar ħin biex jaħdem dan.
They probably have one.	Probabbilment għandhom wieħed.
And this.	U dan.
I need to know now	Għandi bżonn inkun naf issa
There is much more.	Hemm ħafna aktar.
And he thinks it’s a good thing.	U jaħseb li hija ħaġa tajba.
I had a lot.	Kelli ħafna.
He was out.	Huwa kien barra.
This is where you want to be.	Dan huwa fejn trid tkun.
You are here, and you are not here.	Int hawn, u m'intix hawn.
Let’s be here now.	Ejja nkunu hawn issa.
Look as much as you want.	Ħares kemm trid.
It works every time for me.	Jaħdem kull darba għalija.
I wasn’t ready for that	Jien ma kontx lest għal dik
I've tried.	Jien stajt nipprova.
This is actually quite difficult.	Dan huwa fil-fatt pjuttost diffiċli.
I had another problem	Kelli problema oħra
It didn’t take too long with him.	Ma kienx jieħu wisq miegħu.
Well, maybe not quite.	Ukoll, forsi mhux pjuttost.
I said nothing.	Ma għidt xejn.
Do the job you want.	Jagħmel ix-xogħol li trid.
What they are doing.	Dak li qed jagħmlu.
This is not your book.	Dan mhux il-ktieb tiegħek.
I would love to be with you	Inħobb ħafna li nkun miegħek
But knowing that he could do it was not enough.	Imma li kien jaf li seta’ jagħmel dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
I just thought, this is not happening to me	Ħsibt biss, dan mhux qed jiġri lili
I have not much to say.	Għandi ma tantx nitkellem.
I’ve seen it all.	Stajt nara dan kollu.
Not a bad thing.	Mhux xi ħaġa ħażina.
They felt it had to be someone else.	Ħassu li kellu jkun xi ħadd ieħor.
So we know.	Hekk nafu.
I still get along well with him now	Għadni nifhem tajjeb miegħu issa
That's what happened.	Dan ġara hekk.
I will do these again	Se nerġa' nagħmel dawn
I'm not usually.	Jien mhux normalment.
This happened every time.	Dan ġara kull darba.
He didn't have much time.	Ma kellux ħafna ħin.
Something just happened.	Xi ħaġa għadha kif ġara.
He was here, but now he was not.	Kien hawn, imma issa ma kienx.
I know what I want and I go for it	Naf dak li rrid u mmur għalih
And for a while, it wasn’t.	U għal xi żmien, ma kienx.
Someone came.	Xi ħadd daħal.
The only way to do that was fast.	L-uniku mod biex tagħmel dan kien malajr.
It's bad.	Huwa ħażin.
It may never be ready	Jista’ jkun li qatt ma kien lest
I can’t take this anymore	Ma nistax nieħu dan aktar
I’ve never been able to love anyone or anything	Qatt ma stajt inħobb lil xi ħadd jew xejn
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
I knew nothing about work	Ma kont naf xejn dwar ix-xogħol
Not why, just how.	Mhux għaliex, biss kif.
You do it today.	Inti tagħmel dan illum.
He loved what he saw.	Kien iħobb dak li ra.
This is not you.	Dan mhux int.
Looks like I'm waiting for someone	Jidher li qed nistenna lil xi ħadd
That was a long time ago.	Dan kien żmien twil ilu.
I do that	Jien nagħmel hekk
He can go home now.	Jista’ jmur id-dar issa.
I didn't stand a chance	Ma kellix ċans
The front door.	Il-bieb ta’ barra.
I would have been, too	Jien kont inkun, ukoll
I have something that everyone wants.	Għandi xi ħaġa li kulħadd irid.
I never heard back.	Qatt ma smajt lura.
This we cannot do.	Dan ma nistgħux nagħmlu.
They have the same hard time doing it.	Għandhom l-istess ħin diffiċli biex jagħmlu dan.
Just to say something.	Biss biex ngħid xi ħaġa.
I never thought we would	Qatt ma ħsibt li nagħmlu
He couldn't help it.	Ma setax jgħin.
Or something else.	Jew xi ħaġa oħra.
She had time for that.	Kellha ħin għal dan.
It just takes a very long time.	Huwa biss jieħu żmien twil ħafna.
That will be good.	Dak se jkun tajjeb.
More, perhaps, than if it were not so.	Aktar, forsi, milli kieku ma kienx hekk.
I often wonder what he is doing now	Spiss nistaqsi x’qed jagħmel issa
I had never moved.	Qatt ma kelli mort.
Now everyone can go back.	Issa kulħadd jista’ jerġa’ lura.
Now just me.	Issa jien biss.
But now that is.	Imma issa li huwa.
I was never there	Qatt ma kont hemm
Something to do.	Xi ħaġa li tagħmel.
And just being with me.	U biss qed miegħi.
He was not eating.	Ma kienx jiekol.
But so long ago.	Imma tant ilu.
Not sure.	Mhux żgur.
I will be right here.	Jien se nkun eżatt hawn.
I was a little worried.	Kont xi ftit inkwetat.
I never stay.	Jien qatt ma noqgħod.
It was too good for that.	Kien wisq tajjeb għal dan.
Today I was not expecting anyone	Illum ma kont nistenna lil ħadd
I need to be alone for a while	Għandi bżonn inkun waħdi għal ftit żmien
One can only hope, and wait.	Wieħed jista 'biss jittama, u jistenna.
I'm going there soon.	Jien dalwaqt sejjer hemm.
I’m still not sure about that.	Għadni m'inix ċert dwar dan.
He is a good boy.	Huwa tifel tajjeb.
I wonder where this comes from	Nistaqsi minn fejn ġej dan
He thought about the problem.	Huwa ħaseb fuq il-problema.
It must be so.	Għandu jkun hekk.
There was no way.	L-ebda mod ma kien.
It's so hard to see.	Huwa daqshekk diffiċli biex tara.
I just was.	Għadni kemm kont.
So do it.	Hekk tagħmel dan.
From this, more later.	Minn dan, aktar aktar tard.
I still couldn't see anything	Għadni ma stajt nara xejn
I knew nothing of what was wrong	Ma kont naf xejn minn dak li kien ħażin
Again, another year.	Darba oħra, sena oħra.
But we knew nothing.	Imma ma konna nafu xejn.
Probably not.	Probabbilment le.
We do it all !.	Nagħmlu dan kollu!.
I couldn’t believe she was doing this	Ma stajtx nemmen li kienet qed tagħmel dan
But he wasn't going to go.	Imma ma kienx se jmur.
He knows what to do.	Jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
I see exactly who you are now	Nara eżatt min int issa
That was actually a good thing.	Din kienet fil-fatt ħaġa tajba.
You know it is.	Taf li se.
I really shouldn’t be around anyone right now	Jien verament m'għandi nkun madwar ħadd bħalissa
If you go talking, tell the truth.	Jekk tmur titkellem, għid il-verità.
That is.	Li hu.
I thought exactly who it was	Ħsibt eżatt min kien
I doubt it would be helpful to go there	Niddubita li jmur hemm ikun ta’ xi għajnuna
I know, it’s still a little early.	Naf, għadu ftit kmieni.
It looks like a little.	Jidher qisu ftit.
I'm scared of everything	Jien nibża minn kollox
But here.	Imma hawn.
I couldn’t see much outside	Ma stajtx nara ħafna barra
We need these things.	Għandna bżonn dawn l-affarijiet.
I'll be there soon	Jien ser inkun hemm dalwaqt
I have been for over a few years.	Ilni għal aktar minn ftit snin.
That if.	Li jekk.
I am very sorry for that	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal dan
You know enough, too.	Taf biżżejjed, wisq.
I was alone in my room	Kont biss fil-kamra tiegħi
I just want you to know something	Irrid biss li tkun taf xi ħaġa
I said what it was and left.	Għidt x’inhu u telaq.
I try not to think about it.	Nipprova ma naħsibx dwarha.
I can never believe it	Qatt nista' nemmen jien
I have a friend who works there	Għandi ħabib li jaħdem hemm
I was very surprised	Kont sorpriż ħafna
But he could not eat.	Imma ma setax jiekol.
I know you know that	Naf li taf dan
Many.	Ħafna.
I never do that.	Jien qatt ma nagħmel hekk.
It was easy and glad.	Kien faċli u ferħan.
That’s really nothing.	Dak tassew mhu xejn.
I’m just one person.	Jien persuna waħda biss.
Everything now.	Kollox issa.
You may never know.	Qatt ma tista’ tkun taf.
But this was not to be.	Imma dan ma kellux ikun.
I still love him very much	Għadni inħobb ħafna miegħu
That was a good time ago.	Dan kien żmien tajjeb ilu.
I didn’t know how to do that	Ma kontx naf kif nagħmel dan
That, so we do.	Dak, hekk nagħmlu.
We never know what he will do next.	Qatt ma nafu x'se tagħmel wara.
I do the same.	Nagħmel l-istess.
I think you never know	Naħseb li qatt ma tkun taf
Always try to try something.	Dejjem ipprova jipprova xi ħaġa.
Today I have everything.	Illum għandi kollox.
I didn’t do much at the time	Ma tantx għamilt dak iż-żmien
I know more than a few.	Naf aktar minn ftit.
Just as she knew it would.	Hekk kif kienet taf li kieku.
I heard what you said.	Smajt dak li għedt.
I hope you don't either	Nispera li inti lanqas
I’m sure everything will work.	Jien ċert li kollox se jaħdem.
We were together.	Konna flimkien.
And so it should.	U hekk għandu.
Or, not really.	Jew, mhux verament.
I know a little about this	Naf ftit dwar dan
Nothing happened.	Ma ġara xejn.
I will do well	Jien se nagħmel tajjeb
I was still thinking, and not listening	Kont għadni naħseb, u ma nisma
You really don't think anything can go wrong.	Tassew taħseb li xejn ma jista’ jmur ħażin wisq.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
For me, it never happens.	Għalija, qatt mhu hekk li jiġri.
Time has never looked good.	Iż-żmien qatt ma deher tajjeb.
I told my friend, here	Għidt lil ħabib tiegħi, hawn
I'm sure it will be.	Jiena ċert li se jkun.
I think we have something here	Naħseb li għandna xi ħaġa hawn
It needs to be.	Jeħtieġ li jkun.
Now we have a car.	Issa għandna karozza.
But she knew, of course, that there was nothing more.	Imma hi kienet taf, żgur, li ma kien hemm xejn aktar.
I was not a nice person	Jien ma kontx persuna sabiħa
What was worried was what was going to happen next.	Dak li kien inkwetat kien dak li kien se jiġri wara.
I did nothing to do that	Jien ma għamilt xejn biex nagħmel hekk
I never went.	Jien qatt ma mort.
Not a good idea.	Mhux idea tajba.
I wouldn’t be	Jien ma kontx inkun
It was so small.	Kien daqshekk żgħir.
It can happen.	Jista’ jiġri.
My car outside.	Il-karozza tiegħi barra.
Sure.	Żgur.
But something happened.	Imma ġara xi ħaġa.
I never do.	Qatt ma nagħmel.
He was never there.	Hu qatt ma kien hemm.
I know exactly what is going on	Naf eżatt x'inhu jiġri
It’s not working anymore.	Mhux qed jaħdem aktar.
I thought at the time	Ħsibt dak iż-żmien
First in a long, long time.	L-ewwel fi żmien twil u twil.
This will not be easy to tell.	Dan mhux se jkun faċli li tgħid.
It’s bad, very, very bad.	Hija ħażina, ħafna, ħażina ħafna.
I had enough for both of us	Kelli biżżejjed għalina t-tnejn
I was expecting that	Kont qed nistenna hekk
I didn’t know what I was going to do for him.	Ma kontx naf x'se nagħmel għalih.
Never, ever wanted that car	Qatt, qatt ma ridt dik il-karozza
I was glad to come	Kont ferħan li ġej
And it can’t be that way anymore.	U ma jistax ikun hekk aktar.
I can expect a little more	Nista' nistenna ftit ieħor
I have no idea what's going on here	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'hemm hawn
He can't go.	Ma jistax imur.
I always knew the truth	Dejjem kont naf il-verità
you say.	tgħid int.
There is no way it can look good.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li jista 'jidher tajjeb.
It had to be there the last time.	Kellu jkun hemm l-aħħar darba.
You can go back there	Tista' tmur lura hemm
It was fast.	Kienet malajr.
I didn’t want to think about it at all	Ma ridtx naħseb dwarha xejn
I didn’t want to have a child.	Ma ridtx ikolli tifel.
I know this should be	Naf li dan għandu jkun
I was early.	Kont kmieni.
It’s not where it seems.	Mhuwiex fejn jidher.
I know you did this for me	Naf li għamilt dan għalija
This can happen.	Dan jista 'jiġri.
It had been done for a long time.	Kien għamel għal żmien twil.
No one sees us above.	M'hemm ħadd jara magħna hawn fuq.
That alone was not enough.	Dan waħdu ma kienx biżżejjed.
I know it’s still a lot	Naf li għadu ħafna
I was saying something, he was saying something	Jien kont qed ngħid xi ħaġa, kien qed jgħid xi ħaġa
No one knew where she was now.	Ħadd ma kien jaf fejn kienet issa.
It didn’t have to be that way.	Ma kellux ikun hekk.
I knew it wasn’t going to be	Kont naf li ma kienx se jkun
Too often, it doesn’t.	Spiss wisq, ma jagħmilx hekk.
I just hope he’s still here	Nispera biss li għadu hawn
You are happy.	Int kuntent.
This will be a little more.	Dan se jkun ftit aktar.
It's always the same.	Huwa dejjem l-istess.
Much more money was needed.	Kien hemm bżonn ħafna aktar flus.
You still are.	Għadek int.
And I didn’t know.	U ma kontx taf.
Now I can't even be your friend	Issa ma nistax inkun lanqas ħabib tiegħek
As much as possible.	Bħal kemm jista’ jkun.
I was happy about it.	Kont kuntent dwar dan.
There's nothing I can do about it	Ma nista’ nagħmel xejn miegħu
She had to go home.	Kellha tmur id-dar.
Glad to help.	Ferħan li jgħin.
I wanted to know more about it	Ridt inkun naf aktar dwarha
I'm not good.	Jien mhux tajjeb.
I never was.	Jien qatt ma kont.
Everyone lost.	Kulħadd tilef.
You should already know this.	Għandek diġà tkun taf dan.
Maybe they were friends.	Forsi kienu ħbieb.
No one had to live.	Ħadd ma kellu jgħix.
Come with me, he said.	Ejja miegħi, qal.
I'm not good.	Jien mhux tajjeb.
I need to do this.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan.
I need to eat something	Għandi bżonn niekol xi ħaġa
It still works.	Għadu jaħdem dan.
I want that more than anything	Nixtieq dak aktar minn kull ħaġa
Come on, go.	Jiġi, imur.
It's mine, not yours.	Huwa tiegħi, mhux tiegħek.
Someone else is with him.	Xi ħadd ieħor qiegħed miegħu.
I just want you to sit down and eat with me	Nixtieq biss li inti toqgħod u tiekol miegħi
I didn’t want something like that to happen	Ma ridtx li jiġri xi ħaġa bħal dik
I didn’t have time to ask	Ma kellix ħin nistaqsi
Work.	Xogħol.
I know nothing, I have done nothing	Jien ma naf xejn, ma għamilt xejn
But that's not how it started.	Imma mhux hekk beda.
Your time is not now.	Il-ħin tiegħek mhux issa.
I can't understand what all this is about	Ma nistax nifhem x'inhu dan kollu
No one knew she was here.	Ħadd ma kien jaf li kienet hawn.
I’m glad to see that now.	Jien kuntent li jara dan issa.
I understand why I did what I did	Nifhem għaliex għamilt dak li għamilt
And so it had to be.	U hekk kellu jkun.
For the following.	Għal dan li ġej.
She didn't.	Hija ma.
But we can't.	Imma ma nistgħux.
That cannot be the case.	Dan ma jistax ikun hekk.
I can’t do that from here.	Jien ma nistax nagħmel dan minn hawn.
They felt something bad about it.	Ħassu xi ħaġa ħażina dwar dan.
No one knew what was coming for him.	Ħadd ma kien jaf li ġej għalih.
I never knew people better.	Qatt ma kont naf nies aħjar.
I have everything.	Għandi kollox.
I didn't want anyone to know	Ma ridt li ħadd ikun jaf
Apparently, they felt bad about something.	Milli jidher, ħassu ħażin dwar xi ħaġa.
This has been going on for some time.	Dan ilu ġej għal xi żmien.
I didn’t know about all that	Ma kontx naf dwar dak kollu
There was no need to stand.	Ma kienx hemm bżonn toqgħod.
There are other people.	Hemm nies oħra.
Like he was waiting for someone to go with him.	Bħal hu kien qed jistenna lil xi ħadd biex imur miegħu.
It was too long, too long.	Kien twil wisq, twil wisq.
I had one by one.	Kelli waħda minn waħda.
It is now.	Huwa issa.
I knew that before it all happened	Kont naf li qabel ma ġara dan kollu
I can’t do that often	Ma nistax nagħmel dan spiss
I know what's going on here	Naf x'qed jiġri hawn
Definitely possible.	Żgur li jista’ jkun.
I can tell you that now	Nista’ ngħidlek hekk issa
I just thought, you know.	Ħsibt biss, taf.
But no such thing.	Imma l-ebda ħaġa bħal din.
It was so hard to tell.	Kien tant diffiċli li tgħid.
I couldn't see anything.	Ma stajt nara xejn.
Not so much, anymore.	Mhux daqshekk, aktar.
Everything seemed easy to me.	Kollox deher faċli għalija.
It should take a few hours.	Għandu jieħu ftit sigħat.
I was not able to speak	Ma kontx kapaċi nitkellem
I was going to do that	Kont se nagħmel dan
I didn’t want that.	Jien ma ridtx hekk.
This probably won't work.	Dan probabbilment mhux se jaħdem.
I think she was telling me that	Naħseb li kienet tgħidli hekk
It's not as small as it used to be.	Huwa mhux daqshekk żgħir kif kien.
I had to tell you first	L-ewwel kelli ngħidlek
It can be either one.	Jista 'jkun jew waħda.
It had to be beautiful.	Kellha tkun sabiħa.
I think you should do that	Jiena naħseb li għandek tagħmel dan
After that is enough time.	Wara dan huwa żmien biżżejjed.
I’ve seen too much of this on this job.	Rajt wisq minn dan fuq dan ix-xogħol.
I'm not right for you	M'iniex tajjeb għalik
I needed to hear	Kelli bżonn nisma’
I hadn't seen that before	Dik ma kontx rajt qabel
He went back and looked at both of them.	Huwa mar lura u ħares lejn it-tnejn.
Yesterday again.	Ilbieraħ mill-ġdid.
I thought it was way more likely	Ħsibt li huwa mod aktar probabbli
I had no coming	Jien ma kellix ġej
I think he wanted me to see this	Naħseb li ried li nara dan
This would not be good.	Dan ma jkunx tajjeb.
This was hard for me to take.	Dan kien diffiċli għalija nieħu.
About the same time.	Madwar l-istess ħin.
You probably never did as you did	Probabbilment qatt ma għamilt hekk kif int
We have time for more.	Għandna ħin għal aktar.
You are exactly where you should be.	Int eżatt fejn għandek tkun.
That was it.	Li kien.
Until she.	Sakemm hi.
Definitely he is.	Żgur li hu.
We do something like this every year.	Nagħmlu xi ħaġa bħal din kull sena.
Alone, it wasn’t so much.	Waħdu, ma kienx daqshekk.
It was him or us.	Kien hu jew aħna.
Maybe you can do that.	Forsi tista 'tagħmel dan.
I’ve never been around one like this	Qatt ma kont kont madwar wieħed bħal dan
A year ago, it would have been easy	Sena ilu, kien ikun faċli
I like that a lot	Nixtieq li ħafna
I have no idea what they are doing.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'qed jagħmlu.
A few more hours or something	Ftit sigħat oħra jew xi ħaġa
It looked good.	Deher tajjeb.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
I'm really scared.	Jien tassew nibża’.
I need to be better than that	Għandi bżonn inkun aħjar minn hekk
Just for us.	Għalina biss.
But that was years back.	Imma dak kien snin lura.
But that was a very long time ago.	Imma dak kien żmien twil ħafna ilu.
I wanted to know if I was home	Ridt inkun naf jekk kontx id-dar
But he had to know.	Imma kellu jkun jaf.
I go alone, which is good.	Immur waħdi, li huwa tajjeb.
Someone has to have.	Xi ħadd irid ikollu.
It would be better that way.	Ikun aħjar hekk.
She knew, well enough.	Hija kienet taf, tajjeb biżżejjed.
He has to play badly.	Irid jilgħab ħażin.
I believe you know that.	Nemmen li taf li.
This was better.	Dan kien aħjar.
I knew you had to be you	Kont naf li trid tkun int
I thought I wanted to be alone	Ħsibt li ridt tkun waħdek
Same thing with me.	L-istess ħaġa miegħi.
And this will never happen.	U dan qatt mhu se jiġri.
This is the last one.	Din hija l-aħħar waħda.
It was for everyone.	Kien għal kulħadd.
I love everything about it.	Inħobb kollox dwarha.
Tomorrow if you wish.	Għada jekk tixtieq.
You haven’t done much at home.	Int ma tantx għamilt id-dar tiegħek.
I've never been with other people	Qatt ma għamilt ma’ nies oħra
I still can’t believe this is happening	Għadni ma nistax nemmen li dan qed jiġri
He really looks like mine.	Huwa tassew jidher bħal tiegħi.
I never said anything about it	Qatt ma għedt xejn dwarha
By now we knew he was a boy.	Sa issa konna nafu li kien tifel.
If you don’t want to, you shouldn’t.	Jekk ma tridx, m'għandekx.
I didn't know that a person could be so happy	Ma kontx naf li persuna tista’ tkun daqshekk kuntent
Your work is done here.	Ix-xogħol tiegħek isir hawn.
I never thought so	Qatt ma kont naħseb
No one ever wanted to be here.	Ħadd qatt ma ried ikun hawn.
Do you think that would be easy?	Taħseb li din tkun dik faċli.
I couldn't say for sure	Ma stajtx ngħid għal ċert
It must be difficult.	Għandu jkun diffiċli.
I was hoping to see someone	Kont nittama li nara lil xi ħadd
He shouldn't think so.	M'għandux jaħseb hekk.
Nothing will happen here.	Hawn mhu se jiġri xejn.
Nothing is ready	Xejn mhu lest
But that just seems bad.	Imma dan jidher biss ħażin.
He just wanted to get out.	Ried biss barra.
Very good friend.	Ħabib tajjeb ħafna.
I didn’t want to wait.	Ma ridtx nistenna.
By now, everyone knew.	Sa issa, kulħadd kien jaf.
I want to be a person again.	Irrid inkun persuna mill-ġdid.
I was worried about my friend	Kont inkwetat dwar ħabib tiegħi
But there is more.	Imma hemm aktar.
I was thinking of you today	Jien kont qed naħseb għalik illum
I just can’t believe it	Jien biss ma nistax nemmen
I really didn't know what to expect	Verament ma kontx naf x'se nistenna
I am sure everything will be fine	Jiena ċert li kollox se jkun tajjeb
I want to talk to you about this.	Irrid nitkellem miegħek dwar dan.
Well as you will.	Ukoll kif inti se.
It's not as hard as you think.	Mhuwiex diffiċli kif taħseb.
Nothing is working.	Xejn mhu qed jaħdem.
Your friend may want to do the same.	Ħabib tiegħek jista 'jkun irid jagħmel l-istess.
now it is.	issa huwa.
Really really good.	Tassew tassew tajjeb.
Not a problem now.	Mhux problema issa.
That was good, boy, very good.	Dak kien tajjeb, tifel, tajjeb ħafna.
I was just thinking about it	Kont biss naħseb dwar dan
He must be here soon or he may never be able to go.	Irid ikun hawn dalwaqt jew qatt ma seta’ jmur.
I had no idea you could do that	Ma kellix idea li tista' tagħmel dan
You have to think about it.	Għandek taħseb dwar dan.
I had no idea there was such a thing.	Kelli l-ebda idea li kien hemm ħaġa bħal din.
I couldn’t tell.	Ma stajtx ngħid.
This takes a lot of time.	Dan jieħu ħafna ħin.
I already knew what he was going to say next	Diġà kont naf x’se jgħid wara
I will be back tomorrow morning	Jien se nkun lura għada filgħodu
I said a lot of the same thing	Għidt ħafna l-istess ħaġa
I'm going home.	Sejjer id-dar.
I did my best to be with you	Kont nagħmel minn kollox biex inkun miegħek
I don’t know why, or when.	Ma nafx għaliex, jew lanqas meta.
I had nothing.	Jien ma kelli xejn.
I was as surprised as he was	Kont sorpriż daqskemm kien hu
She didn’t know what to think.	Hija ma kinitx taf x'se taħseb.
I wish there was an easier way	Nixtieq li jkun hemm mod aktar faċli
Not like someone had back.	Mhux bħal xi ħadd kellu lura.
I wasn’t sure I wanted to know	Ma kontx ċert li ridt li tkun taf
But he was not going to leave.	Imma ma kienx se jitlaq.
I wasn’t completely surprised	Ma kontx sorpriż għal kollox
I would be everything to you	Jien inkun kollox għalik
I couldn't see well enough	Ma stajtx nara tajjeb biżżejjed
And everyone knows why.	U kulħadd ikun jaf għaliex.
It belonged to someone else.	Kien ta’ xi ħadd ieħor.
I got another chance	Ġejt ċans ieħor
You just do it now.	Inti biss tagħmel dan issa.
I know where this is going	Naf fejn sejjer dan
I don’t just do this for everyone	Jien ma nagħmel dan għal kulħadd biss
I think about it all the time	Naħseb dwar dan il-ħin kollu
I understand you were all together	Nifhem li inti kienu kollha flimkien
I have no idea what all this is about	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'inhu dan kollu
I will not do it again	Mhux se nerġa' nagħmel
Wrong way you think.	Mod ħażin kif taħseb.
I don’t know better.	Ma nafx aħjar.
But no one was coming.	Imma ħadd ma kien jiġi.
I really wanted to be with you	Jien ridt verament inkun miegħek
It may not be too late.	Jista’ ma jkunx tard wisq.
It's money.	Huwa flus.
And there is nothing you or anyone else can do about it.	U m'hemm xejn inti jew xi ħadd ieħor tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
Better sit down.	Aħjar toqgħod bilqiegħda.
There was so much going wrong with that.	Kien hemm tant li deher ħażin ma 'dak.
Don't do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan.
I eat after I get home	niekol wara li ġejt lura d-dar
I could never go back	Qatt ma stajt immur lura
See what's there.	Tara x'hemm.
A great idea is a great idea	Idea kbira hija idea kbira
Or he told me it was.	Jew qalli li kien.
I’m not going to settle for that	Jien mhux se noqgħod għal dan
I was supposed to be here before	Jien suppost kelli nkun hawn qabel
I couldn't think of anything to say	Ma stajt naħseb xi ngħid
I know he used to say that too.	Naf li kien jgħid hekk ukoll.
But now that may not be the case.	Imma issa dan jista 'ma jiġri.
After you have done this.	Wara li tkun għamilt dan.
I can’t do that, not now	Ma nistax nagħmel dan, mhux issa
There is nothing you can do about it.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
I didn’t really know what to expect	Ma kontx verament naf x'se nistenna
I will not believe that	Jien mhux se nemmen li
I didn’t know if it was the same one	Ma kontx naf jekk kienx l-istess wieħed
He may have done so.	Jista' jkun li għamel dan.
Today, few are.	Illum, ftit huma.
There was no need.	Ma kienx hemm bżonn.
It really isn't.	Huwa verament mhux.
That was the truth.	Li kienet il-verità.
I know about that	Jien naf dwar dan
I really don’t need another.	Verament m'għandix bżonn ieħor.
I still can't see anything	Għadni ma nista’ nara xejn
I was hoping it would be soon	Kont nittama li jkun dalwaqt
I knew how they felt	Jien kont naf kif ħassu
I was tired and alone	Kont għajjien u waħdi
It's there, here.	Huwa hemm, hawn.
They felt a little better.	Ħassu ftit aħjar.
I have to believe.	Irrid nemmen.
No one is surprised.	Ħadd mhu sorpriż.
And it must remain so.	U għandu jibqa' hekk.
There is something wrong here.	Hemm xi ħaġa ħażina hawn.
I don’t want to be here either.	Ma rridx inkun hawn lanqas.
I was quite young at the time	Dak iż-żmien kont pjuttost żgħir
I thought he said a lot.	Ħsibt li qal ħafna.
Nothing like that happened here.	Xejn bħal dak ma ġara hawn.
I don't know how.	Ma nafx kif.
I didn’t know anyone there	Ma kont naf lil ħadd hemmhekk
I can understand everyone.	Kapaċi nifhem lil kulħadd.
Hard to be around.	Diffiċli li tkun madwar.
Well, no, it doesn’t.	Ukoll, le, ma jagħmilx hekk.
And on and on and on.	U fuq u fuq u fuq.
It should be enough.	Għandu jkun biżżejjed.
Definitely not good.	Żgur li mhux tajjeb.
I wasn't so sure.	Ma kontx daqshekk ċert.
Too, too fast.	Wisq, malajr wisq.
I think everyone has his	Naħseb li kulħadd għandu tiegħu
I don’t know about such things.	Ma nafx dwar affarijiet bħal dawn.
Well, that's what everyone does.	Ukoll, dan huwa dak li jagħmel kulħadd.
I wish he did but he doesn’t	Nixtieq li għamel imma ma jagħmilx hekk
That should be great for you.	Li għandu jkun kbir għalik.
I have to go back home and think.	Ikolli mmur lura d-dar u naħseb.
You don’t want his help.	Ma tridx l-għajnuna tiegħu.
It should not do so.	M'għandux jagħmel hekk.
I know what he's doing	Naf x’qed jagħmel
And this is no better.	U dan mhux aħjar.
But for him, sure.	Imma għalih, żgur.
I doubt everything now.	Niddubita kollox issa.
She was here.	Kienet hawn.
I don't know how bad it can be.	Ma nafx kemm jista’ jkun ħażin.
I can't even think about it	Lanqas nista’ naħseb dwarha
I hadn’t even thought about it	Lanqas kont ħsibt dwarha
I enjoy making things easier for you	Jiena nieħu gost nagħmel l-affarijiet aktar faċli għalik
I don’t know where to go	Ma nafx fejn immur
That is.	Li hu.
And he is right.	U għandu raġun.
If not, we have a problem.	Jekk le, għandna problema.
There is or not.	Hemm jew le.
I can only tell you this	Nista’ ngħidlek dan biss
He is not very happy with you.	Huwa ma tantx kuntent miegħek.
Everyone can see why.	Kulħadd jista’ jara għaliex.
Last time I had to be there.	L-aħħar darba kelli nkun hemm.
In fact I was surprised that it didn’t just come	Fil-fatt kont sorpriż li mhux biss daħal
Now that may be a problem.	Issa din tista’ tkun problema.
I still couldn't believe we were doing it	Għadni ma stajtx nemmen li konna qed nagħmlu dan
And it will be difficult.	U se jkun diffiċli.
It just keeps coming.	Jibqa 'jiġi biss.
I can tell you that	Dan nista’ ngħidlek ħafna
Tom wasn't sure what to do.	Tom ma kienx ċert x'se jagħmel.
It would not be good.	Ma jkunx tajjeb.
In the afternoon.	Wara nofsinhar.
I love one of these.	Inħobb waħda minn dawn.
It’s very, very difficult.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna, ħafna.
I like to be alone	Inħobb inkun waħdi
She appears.	Hija tidher.
If that's who they are.	Jekk dak hu min huma.
No more time.	Mhux aktar ħin.
You say you did well.	Tgħid li għamilt tajjeb.
I will listen	Jien se noqgħod nisma’
That told me a lot.	Dak qalli ħafna.
I don’t know when and how	Ma nafx meta u kif
I will never be happy again.	Qatt ma nkun kuntent mill-ġdid.
He needs time.	Huwa għandu bżonn iż-żmien.
You look so worried.	Inti tidher daqshekk inkwetat.
But so it happened.	Imma hekk ġara.
A lot of work is done	Isir ħafna xogħol
Well, it can happen and happen, often.	Ukoll, jista 'jiġri u jiġri, ta' spiss.
That was really about it.	Dan kien verament dwar dan.
I don't want anything.	Ma rrid xejn.
I knew what it looked like	Kont naf kif tidher
I didn’t even know it	Jien lanqas kont naf
Maybe more now.	Forsi aktar issa.
You don't have to do this alone.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel dan waħdek.
I knew who he was talking to	Kont naf min kien qed jitkellem ma’ min
I think you should go home, now	Naħseb li għandek tmur id-dar, issa
There was no time for that.	Ma kienx hemm ħin għal dan.
I could see.	Stajt nara.
But it's not just there.	Imma mhux hemm biss.
I was doing exactly the same thing	Jien kont nagħmel eżatt l-istess ħaġa
I will not always be here	Mhux dejjem se nkun hawn
This is happening now.	Dan qed jiġri issa.
It came from above.	Ġie minn fuq.
I want to do this.	Irrid nagħmel dan.
I wasn’t worried about that	Ma kontx inkwetat dwar dan
I can't see how bad it can be for you	Ma nistax nara kif jista’ jkun ħażin għalik
I could tell he was a little worried	Jien stajt ngħid li kien ftit inkwetat
But not ready.	Imma mhux lest.
I know people who do that.	Naf nies li jagħmlu dan.
Maybe we are.	Forsi aħna.
That’s all you can do.	Dan huwa dak kollu li tista 'tagħmel.
But there is more.	Imma jkun hemm aktar.
We will be out of here.	Aħna se nkunu barra minn hawn.
Maybe not right now, but she would.	Forsi mhux bħalissa, imma hi kieku.
He really did what he wanted to be.	Huwa tassew għamel dak li jrid ikun.
Can anyone please help.	Jista' xi ħadd jekk jogħġbok jgħin.
I did everything wrong	Jien għamilt kollox ħażin
I love my job.	Inħobb ix-xogħol tiegħi.
That's what he told me.	Dan huwa dak li qalli.
I won't, that's for sure	Jien mhux se, dan żgur
There was no one else to see.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor li jidher.
I always try to doubt everything and everyone	Jien dejjem nipprova niddubita kollox u lil kulħadd
To each of his.	Lil kull wieħed tiegħu.
I would be glad.	Inkun ferħan.
That will do it.	Li se tagħmel dan.
If it's any good.	Jekk huwa xi tajba.
I had to go years ago	I kellha tmur snin ilu
I hope you do what you want too.	Nittama li tagħmel dak li trid int ukoll.
I wish I could do that.	Nixtieq inkun kapaċi nagħmel dan.
Everything is so difficult.	Kollox huwa daqshekk diffiċli.
I was just worried, all that	Kont inkwetat biss, dak kollu
It was very easy.	Kien faċli ħafna.
That was not what he needed right now.	Dan ma kienx dak li kellu bżonn bħalissa.
More another time.	Aktar żmien ieħor.
I couldn't hear what he said	Ma stajtx nisma’ dak li qal
You have to come.	Trid tiġi.
I don't need your help	M'għandix bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek
What he wanted.	Dak li ried.
He can't speak.	Ma jistax jitkellem.
I didn’t want to talk anymore	Ma ridtx nitkellem aktar
I’m not going to say for sure.	Jien mhux se ngħid żgur.
One for each child.	Wieħed għal kull tifel.
I have no idea who he is	M'għandi l-ebda idea min hu
I came here yesterday	Ġejt hawn ilbieraħ
And all is well.	U dak kollu huwa tajjeb.
So we did.	Hekk għamilna.
I want to be fast.	Irrid inkun malajr.
This was pretty easy.	Dan kien pjuttost faċli.
I didn't know I was out.	Ma kontx naf li kont barra.
I was happy to do that	Kont kuntent li nagħmel dan
Which you can do from here.	Li tista’ tagħmel minn hawn.
I think you are right too.	Naħseb li għandek raġun ukoll.
I still have.	Għadni għandi.
I was wondering so too	Jien kont nistaqsi hekk ukoll
You are in.	Inti fi.
I was expecting this	Kont qed nistenna dan
I love being a man.	Inħobb inkun raġel.
I hope this helps.	Nittama li dan jgħin.
And it will stay here.	U hawn se jibqa’.
I like to do this every afternoon about this time	Inħobb nagħmel hekk kull wara nofsinhar dwar dan il-ħin
Only the, the, the.	Biss le, le, le.
This is everyone.	Dan huwa kulħadd.
I know who you are now	Naf min int issa
Year, year after year, year after year.	Sena, wara sena, wara sena.
It's just great.	Huwa biss kbir.
Not great, but better.	Mhux kbir, imma aħjar.
What will happen ?.	X'se jiġri?.
That’s like here and like here.	Dak bħal hawn u bħal hawn.
And no, I couldn't.	U le, ma stajtx.
It's been so long	Ilni ma tant żmien
I haven’t had this in a while	Jien ma kellix dan għal xi żmien
That's what we're about.	Dak hu li aħna qed dwar.
I didn’t want to think about anything	Ma ridt naħseb dwar xejn
I have to tell you.	Ikolli ngħidlek.
As much as you want.	Kemm trid.
I couldn't understand anything she was saying	Ma stajt nifhem xejn li kienet qed tgħid
He will probably survive.	Huwa probabbilment se jgħix.
Not that he wants to talk.	Mhux li jrid jitkellem.
I didn't have to say anything	Ma kelli għalfejn ngħid xejn
Almost a lot of time.	Kważi ħafna ħin.
I knew it would be so	Kont naf li se jkun hekk
That's something.	Dik hija xi ħaġa.
In fact, this is wrong.	Fil-fatt, dan huwa ħażin.
I wanted to know why this happened	Ridt inkun naf għaliex ġara dan
I know you do.	Naf li tagħmel.
You don't do that.	Inti ma tagħmel dan.
You can stay around.	Inti tista 'toqgħod madwar.
It looked bad.	Deher ħażin.
From there.	Minn hemm.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Ma nafx x’inhu ħażin miegħi.
Never more than now	Qatt aktar minn issa
There is someone out there.	Hemm xi ħadd hemmhekk.
I knew there was no one else here	Kont naf li ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor hawn
It is very good for me.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna għalija.
Whether it is a good thing or not.	Kemm jekk hija ħaġa tajba jew le.
She was here, and he was not.	Kienet hawn, u hu ma kienx.
I think it will work well	Naħseb li se jaħdem tajjeb
And he lives.	U jgħix.
Everyone did.	Kulħadd għamel.
He could not sit down.	Ma setax joqgħod bilqiegħda.
But it was not so.	Imma ma kienx hekk.
I think you should go	Naħseb li għandek tmur
This will definitely help.	Dan żgur se jgħin.
Or here’s another way of thinking about it.	Jew hawn mod ieħor kif taħseb dwarha.
I’m sure it will be fine by now.	Jien ċert li se jkun tajjeb sa issa.
No one was saying anything.	Ħadd ma kien jgħid xejn.
She didn't even know where they were.	Lanqas kienet taf fejn kienu.
I’m good for nothing more.	Jien tajjeb għal xejn aktar.
But obviously it wasn’t there.	Imma ovvjament ma kienx hemm.
I would be your friend	Jien inkun ħabib tiegħek
I don’t know much about it.	Ma nafx wisq dwarha.
No one knew for sure.	Ħadd ma kien jaf żgur.
That was her.	Dik kienet hi.
He couldn’t do anything.	Ma setax jagħmel xi ħaġa.
I suspect he told the truth	Nissuspetta li qal il-verità
Obviously, there was before.	Ovvjament, kien hemm qabel.
She wants to do it on her own.	Hija trid tagħmel dan waħedha.
Not a very good job.	Mhux xogħol tajjeb ħafna.
It really doesn't.	Huwa verament ma.
There was no one there.	Ma kien hemm ħadd hemmhekk.
I will be doing it myself	Se nkun qed nagħmel jien
And it was so beautiful.	U kienet daqshekk sabiħa.
I would be interested to think about it	Inkun interessat li naħseb dwarha
Now this is difficult.	Issa dan huwa diffiċli.
It’s not happening yet.	Għadu mhux qed jiġri.
I still couldn't believe it	Għadni ma stajtx nemmen
I was very tired, you see	Kont għajjien ħafna, tara
We can go home now.	Nistgħu mmorru d-dar issa.
I hope it won’t.	Jiena nispera li mhux se.
It works for you.	Jaħdem għalik.
I’m ready when my time comes	Jien lest meta jasal il-ħin tiegħi
This will be difficult.	Dan se jkun diffiċli.
No work either.	L-ebda xogħol lanqas.
Come as you are.	Ejja kif int.
I'm glad you're okay.	Jien kuntent li inti tajjeb.
We will not do that.	Aħna mhux se nagħmlu hekk.
I don’t know everything.	Jien ma nafx kollox.
I can't do otherwise	Ma nistax nagħmel mod ieħor
Rather, actually.	Pjuttost, fil-fatt.
I probably would, too	Probabbilment inkun, ukoll
I thought it was a little small	Ħsibt li kien ftit żgħir
That was work.	Dan kien xogħol.
It seemed to work.	Deher li jaħdem.
But that is a problem.	Imma dik hija problema.
I know how difficult it can be	Naf kemm jista’ jkun diffiċli
Maybe it won’t be too bad.	Forsi mhux se jkun ħażin wisq.
I don’t want to be there.	Ma rridx hemmhekk.
I had no idea it was so bad	Ma kellix idea li kien daqshekk ħażin
I wish we had one here	Nixtieq li kellna waħda hawn
We know this, now.	Dan nafu, issa.
That’s what needs to happen.	Dak hu li jeħtieġ li jiġri.
He could tell how well he was doing.	Seta’ jgħid kemm kien sejjer tajjeb.
I couldn’t tell anyone about it	Ma stajt ngħid lil ħadd dwar dan
I didn’t know so much about it	Jien ma kontx naf hekk dwarha
It went well there.	Mar tajjeb hemmhekk.
I didn’t want to be home	Ma ridtx inkun id-dar
I also think that should be the case	Naħseb ukoll li hekk għandu jkun
They are always together.	Huma dejjem flimkien.
You'll know more.	Int tkun taf aktar.
And that time passed.	U dak iż-żmien għadda.
They were there for a while.	Kienu hemm għal xi żmien.
I don’t and won’t.	Jien m'għandix u mhux se.
He didn't even know what to say.	Lanqas ma kien jaf x’se jgħid.
I had no idea where I was going	Ma kellix idea minn fejn immur
I’ve always been there for him	Jien dejjem kont hemm għalih
I would like to know.	Nixtieq inkun naf.
I think everything is fine	Naħseb li kollox huwa tajjeb
It's just.	Huwa biss.
But that’s not really the truth.	Imma dik mhix verament il-verità.
I don’t like that door to be there.	Ma nħobbx li dak il-bieb ikun hemm.
Today I had a lot of work	Illum kelli ħafna xogħol
I didn't know where.	Ma kontx naf fejn.
Maybe there was later.	Forsi kien hemm aktar tard.
You saw what happened to me.	Inti rajt dak li ġara lili.
Not that it was.	Mhux li kienet.
Me too.	Jien ukoll.
I’ve never been here before, that’s bad	Qatt ma kont hawn qabel, dan ħażin
You wanted me.	Inti ridt lili.
It can't be that way.	Ma jistax ikun hekk.
And so he wants to do.	U hekk irid jagħmel.
No one knew who was right.	Ħadd ma kien jaf min kellu raġun.
Not back at all.	Mhux lura għal kollox.
I didn’t know.	Ma kontx naf.
He was not finished his work.	Huwa ma kienx lest ix-xogħol tiegħu.
I didn’t have to think who had done this	Ma kellix għalfejn naħseb min kien għamel dan
This book has been coming for a long time.	Dan il-ktieb ilu żmien twil ġej.
This has happened many times.	Dan ġara ħafna drabi.
There is no way to tell.	M'hemm l-ebda mod biex tgħid.
Try me wrong.	Ipprova lili ħażin.
I hope this helps you	Nispera li dan ikun ta' għajnuna għalik
This started working.	Dan beda jaħdem.
There's just me.	Hemm jien biss.
I think anyone who is unhappy should do the same	Naħseb li kull min mhux kuntent għandu jagħmel l-istess
I try at home.	Nipprova d-dar.
This is not so.	Dan mhux hekk.
I'm almost there.	Jien kważi hemm.
She might as well say.	Hija tista 'tgħid ukoll.
It could be with someone else, and so could you.	Jista’ jkun ma’ xi ħadd ieħor, u int ukoll.
In fact, it should be pretty easy to do.	Fil-fatt, għandu jkun pjuttost faċli li tagħmel.
Feel a little like that now.	Ħassu ftit hekk issa.
How much do you think he should.	Kemm taħseb li għandu.
That would be hard enough.	Dan ikun diffiċli biżżejjed.
It has one.	Għandu wieħed.
I just wanted to have fun	Ridt biss nieħu gost
All on all.	Kulħadd fuq kulħadd.
It wasn't you.	Ma kontx int.
It will take work and time.	Ser jieħu xogħol u ħin.
They were just out for a good time.	Kienu biss barra għal ħin tajjeb.
He was doing everything better.	Kien jagħmel kollox aħjar.
Once I was young too	Darba kont żgħir ukoll
But she did more than that.	Imma għamlet aktar minn hekk.
That time is not now.	Dak iż-żmien mhux issa.
That's about it.	Dan huwa dwar dan.
I just said.	Għadni kemm għedt.
I really have no idea why.	Jien verament m'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex.
There was no one.	Ma kien hemm ħadd.
I understand that more than ever now.	Nifhem li aktar minn qatt qabel issa.
But he was very unemployed.	Imma kien bla xogħol ħafna.
He died for us.	Miet għalina.
I know it was for me	Naf li kien għalija
You can come with us now, or you can do it later.	Tista' tiġi magħna issa, jew tista' tagħmel dan aktar tard.
My friends.	Ħbieb tiegħi.
I'm very good.	Jien tajjeb ħafna.
And no one saw anything.	U ħadd ma ra xejn.
No job is too small or too big.	L-ebda xogħol mhu żgħir wisq jew kbir wisq.
What came before.	Dak li ġie qabel.
And you will too.	U int tkun ukoll.
No, you can't go there.	Le, ma tistax tmur hemm.
I was bad enough for that	Kelli ħażin biżżejjed għal dan
We have something for everyone !.	Għandna xi ħaġa għal kulħadd!.
That’s the first thing.	Dik hija l-ewwel ħaġa.
Why did this happen?	Għaliex ġara hekk?.
They were something.	Kienu xi ħaġa.
I need someone who knows what he is doing	Għandi bżonn xi ħadd li jaf x'qed jagħmel
He has problems.	Għandu problemi.
I think they are both right	Naħseb li fil-fatt it-tnejn għandhom raġun
Now you can't.	Issa ma tistax.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
I’m glad this happens.	Jien ferħan li dan jiġri.
A little too fast	Ftit wisq malajr
He didn’t want it to be easy.	Ma riedx li jkun faċli.
It's just beautiful.	Hija biss sabiħa.
I had never seen anyone do such a thing before	Qatt ma kont rajt lil ħadd jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din qabel
It was better than that, better than that.	Kien aħjar minn hekk, aħjar minn hekk.
I'm sure it will be good	Jiena ċert li se tkun tajba
He said for sure.	Huwa qal żgur.
It works without problems.	Jaħdem mingħajr problemi.
Time passed quickly.	Iż-żmien għadda malajr.
As they are.	Kif huma.
I can tell you that.	Nista’ ngħidlek hekk.
I know something is better than what we have now	Naf li xi ħaġa hija aħjar minn dak li għandna issa
They will obviously do a very good job.	Huma ovvjament se jagħmlu xogħol tajjeb ħafna.
I don’t know what’s going on with this	Ma nafx x'qed jiġri dwar dan
They were there so fast.	Kienu hemm daqshekk malajr.
He saw the following.	Huwa ra li ġej.
I didn’t want to know.	Ma ridtx inkun naf.
Everything that needs to be done can wait.	Dak kollu li hemm bżonn biex isir jista’ jistenna.
And here we can do a lot.	U hawn nistgħu nagħmlu ħafna.
I like to see this.	Jien inħobb nara dan.
Now you want it again.	Issa trid mill-ġdid.
We will be.	Aħna se nkunu.
It was about how he did it.	Kien dwar kif għamel dan.
It came to me.	Ġie għandi.
That was going to happen.	Dak kien se jiġri.
It's just me.	Huwa biss jien.
Everyone was coming.	Kulħadd kien ġej.
I didn't know what was going on	Ma kontx naf x’kien qed jiġri
So we did for a while.	Hekk għamilna għal ftit.
Which he didn’t have.	Li ma kellux.
As you say.	Kif tgħid.
I was nothing more	Jien ma kont xejn aktar
Probably not so long.	Probabbilment lanqas daqshekk twil.
Enough time too, you say.	Ħin biżżejjed ukoll, tgħid int.
He had thought the same thing.	Huwa kien ħaseb l-istess ħaġa.
Now here it was.	Issa hawn kien.
I always try to be better	Dejjem nipprova nkun aħjar
There is no other way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor.
I thought it just happened.	Ħsibt li ġara biss.
I know I did that	Naf li għamilt dan
I couldn’t see that ever happening	Ma stajtx nara li qatt jiġri
It was too late.	Kien tard wisq.
I wanted to have fun	Ridt nieħu gost
I’m not good at waiting.	Jien mhux tajjeb nistenna.
He is never tired.	Hu qatt ma għajjien.
I went with him	Jien mort miegħu
I think he can wait until morning	Naħseb li jista’ jistenna sa filgħodu
I hope it helps.	Nittama li jgħin.
And this may be our last	U dan jista 'jkun l-aħħar tagħna
He looked surprised.	Kien deher sorpriż.
I have enough for both of us.	Għandi biżżejjed għalina t-tnejn.
But I heard about it.	Imma smajt dwarha.
Everything was fine.	Kollox kien tajjeb.
He had only one.	Kellu wieħed biss.
I haven’t heard anything like this	Jien ma smajt xejn bħal dan
This is pretty quick.	Dan huwa pjuttost malajr.
He passed, too.	Huwa għadda, ukoll.
It is a very good idea.	Hija idea tajba ħafna.
Probably us.	Probabbilment aħna.
I should never have done such a thing	Qatt ma kelli nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din
I didn’t think he had said anything like that before.	Ma kontx naħseb li kien qal xi ħaġa bħal dik qabel.
I couldn’t sit down.	Ma stajtx noqgħod bilqiegħda.
I go home.	Immur id-dar.
You can't do much about it.	Ma tistax tagħmel ħafna dwar dan.
It would make my job so much easier.	Ikun jagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi daqshekk aktar faċli.
Or is it good.	Jew huwa tajjeb.
Good to know you don't want more.	Tajjeb taf li ma tridx aktar.
I was tired, that was all	Kont għajjien, dak kien kollu
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Ma nistax, ma nistax, ma nistax.
It's just that.	Huwa biss li.
I’m not sure anyone really knows.	M'inix ċert li xi ħadd verament jaf.
I just wish I hadn’t	Nixtieq biss li ma kontx
I know it's not you.	Naf li mhux int.
I had to buy some time	Kelli nixtri ftit ħin
I couldn't speak, I didn't want to speak	Ma stajtx nitkellem, ma ridtx nitkellem
I thought you would be here by now	Ħsibt li inti tkun hawn sa issa
Around the house as well.	Madwar id-dar ukoll.
I don't know what happened	Ma nafx x’ġara
Not sure, but probably.	Mhux żgur, imma probabbilment.
I’ve been thinking about this for a while.	Ilni naħseb dwar dan għal xi żmien.
I want to be there for you	Irrid inkun hemm għalik
And it was great.	U kien kbir.
It's a good idea.	Hija idea tajba.
I still couldn’t go back to my room.	Għadni ma stajtx immur lura fil-kamra tiegħi.
He couldn't tell.	Ma setax jgħid.
No one can know.	Ħadd ma jista’ jkun jaf.
But he could do it.	Imma seta’ jagħmel dan.
But no one knows anything.	Imma ħadd ma jaf xejn.
It shouldn’t have been that hard, but, who knows.	Ma kellux ikun dan diffiċli, imma, min jaf.
I'm not sure how much.	M'inix ċert minn kemm.
I never went home.	Jien qatt ma mort id-dar.
Because we are as we are	Għaliex aħna kif aħna
This is your home as well.	Din hija d-dar tiegħek ukoll.
And it always does well	U dejjem jagħmel tajjeb
But the first was still there.	Imma l-ewwel kien għadu hemm.
Someone wants to.	Xi ħadd irid.
And so we did.	U hekk għamilna.
I have no idea what they are doing	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'qed jagħmlu
I can't see it anymore	Ma nistax nara aktar
She can do it.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan.
I’m sure she did.	Jien ċert li għamlet.
And it wasn’t.	U ma kienx.
We can do better than that.	Nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar minn dan.
That will be there for a long time.	Li se jkun hemm għal żmien twil.
I had everything ready to go	Kelli kollox lest biex immur
You know what's coming.	Taf x’qed ġej.
I'm going.	Jien se mmur.
Very bad.	Ħażin ħafna.
I really couldn't say	Verament ma stajtx ngħid
I was scared of that	Jien kont nibża’ minn hekk
There is another way.	Hemm mod ieħor.
I was going to be alone	Kont se nkun waħdi
But it never happened.	Imma qatt ma kien jiġri.
This may work.	Dan jista 'jaħdem.
There may be other things.	Jista’ jkun hemm affarijiet oħra.
Someone has to be home.	Xi ħadd għandu jkun id-dar.
But obviously it can’t be where it’s not.	Imma ovvjament ma jistax ikun fejn mhux.
I can't say anything else	Ma nistax ngħid xi ħaġa oħra
I'm all you are	Jien dak kollu li int
But it was something.	Imma kienet xi ħaġa.
That’s the same thing you’re doing right now.	Dik hija l-istess ħaġa li qed tagħmel bħalissa.
I can’t wait much longer	Ma nistax nistenna ħafna aktar
It is a very good thing.	Hija ħaġa tajba ħafna.
This can only be good	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb biss
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi le.
It's for you.	Huwa għalik.
I can be a better man for you	Nista’ nkun raġel aħjar għalik
I thought it would be me	Ħsibt li se nkun jien
It has to be that way.	Irid ikun hekk.
I'm not going to do anything	Jien mhu se nagħmel xejn
He didn’t tell me anything.	Ma qalli xejn.
And it won’t go away before we do.	U mhux se jmur qabel ma nagħmlu.
I need to see what she really wants	Għandi bżonn nara xi trid hi tassew
I wonder where he really lives	Nistaqsi fejn verament jgħix
I thought he did.	Ħsibt li għamel.
I’m really someone else	Jien tassew xi ħadd ieħor
Today difficult for me.	Illum diffiċli għalija.
I have done this a few other times.	Għamilt dan ftit drabi oħra.
I hope it works.	Nittama li jaħdem.
I would say it was mine	Jien ngħid li kien tiegħi
I will never be back.	Jien qatt ma nkun lura.
Not the same thing.	Mhux l-istess ħaġa.
Now.	Issa.
I see what you are doing wrong	Nara x'qed tagħmel ħażin
I was one and the other.	Jien kont wieħed u ieħor.
I’ve been able to do this forever	Jien stajt nagħmel dan għal dejjem
Not back then.	Mhux lura dak iż-żmien.
He was with us.	Kien magħna.
And he looked.	U ħares.
I tell you.	Jien ngħidlek.
To do this you need.	Biex tagħmel dan għandek bżonn.
This was not good.	Dan ma kienx tajjeb.
There is enough money out there.	Hemm biżżejjed flus hemmhekk.
I think that’s a good thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba.
I'm sure he doesn't expect you to sit down.	Jien ċert li ma jistenna li inti toqgħod bilqiegħda.
He was eating.	Kien jiekol.
I'm not sure what to do.	M'inix ċert x'se nagħmel.
I will be there this afternoon	Jien se nkun hemm illum wara nofsinhar
I couldn't go alone	Ma stajtx immur waħdi
Size not so much.	Daqs mhux daqshekk.
I will do this very soon	Se nagħmel dan malajr ħafna
He wasn't sure why he did it, only that it was good.	Ma kienx ċert għaliex għamel, biss li kien tajjeb.
The problem is that it is not.	Il-problema hi li mhux.
I hope someday	Nispera li xi darba
I haven’t even gone home yet	Għadni lanqas mort id-dar
I can't understand what's going on	Ma nistax nifhem x'qed jiġri
He is such a good boy.	Huwa tifel daqshekk tajjeb.
It took a while.	Ħa ftit.
It wasn't just me.	Ma kontx jien biss.
There will not be enough for everyone.	Mhux se jkun hemm biżżejjed għal kulħadd.
I didn’t even have one	Jien lanqas biss kelli waħda
I wonder if you can say the same	Nistaqsi jekk tistax tgħid l-istess
I wanted to know what was going on.	Ridt inkun naf x’qed jiġri.
I can make things better	Nista' nagħmel l-affarijiet aħjar
We can't.	Ma nistgħux.
This is not an all or nothing problem.	Din mhix problema kollha jew xejn.
I'm afraid it won't	Nibża li mhux se
There was more to it.	Kien hemm aktar għalih.
Everyone has.	Kulħadd għandu.
Things were so, so hard.	L-affarijiet kienu tant, tant diffiċli.
I still can't believe it	Għadni ma nistax nemmen
Which is great.	Li huwa kbir.
I hope you don't.	Nittama li inti ma.
He didn't have to.	Huwa ma kellux.
Both do.	It-tnejn jagħmlu.
It was school.	Kienet l-iskola.
I'm willing to go with you but.	Jien lest li mmur miegħek imma .
That was better.	Li kien aħjar.
I know everything about what I did	Naf kollox dwar dak li għamilt
I was great.	Kont kbir.
He is a good boy.	Huwa tifel tajjeb.
She will say something.	Hija se tgħid xi ħaġa.
I have to be with him	Għandi nkun miegħu
I don’t like his job.	Ma nħobbx ix-xogħol tiegħu.
That’s my first problem.	Dik hi l-ewwel problema tiegħi.
But in fact, you are not.	Imma fil-fatt, m'intix.
Harder than before.	Aktar diffiċli minn qabel.
I want to know who you are	Irrid inkun naf min int
So it happens.	Hekk jiġri hekk.
He was telling the truth.	Kien qed jgħid il-verità.
I’m here, ’he said.	Jien hawn,’ qal.
I know it will happen	Naf li se jiġri
That's not good.	Dak mhux tajjeb.
That’s probably what’s wrong with me.	Dak huwa probabbilment dak li hu ħażin miegħi.
I can't go back like that	Ma nistax immur lura hekk
I'm sure it will, of course, but.	Jien ċert li se, ovvjament, imma.
That would be good.	Dak ikun tajjeb.
This is not an easy time.	Dan mhux żmien faċli.
And he wanted to be her.	U ried li tkun hi.
I can’t believe how easy this is	Ma nistax nemmen kemm hu faċli dan
He had to be ready for the morning.	Kellu jkun lest għal filgħodu.
John told me.	John qalli.
I need to sit for a while	Għandi bżonn noqgħod noqgħod għal ftit
Not long ago.	Mhux twil ilu.
There is everything he wants to win.	Hemm kollox irid jirbaħ.
Maybe it would.	Forsi kieku.
I think it will be good	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb
I know what's going on	Naf x’qed jiġri
I was glad it wasn’t	Kont ferħan li ma kienx
I hope it helps.	Nispera li jgħin.
I doubt it will ever be the same	Niddubita li qatt ser ikun l-istess
I know what you're seeing	Naf x’qed jara
I would be home later.	Aktar tard inkun id-dar.
It will soon be late in the evening.	Dalwaqt se jkun tard filgħaxija.
It was there.	Kien hemm.
I thought that very well	Ħsibt li tajjeb ħafna
He really wasn't.	Huwa verament ma kienx.
It wasn’t there now.	Ma kienx hemm issa.
I would go so far.	Nixtieq immur tant.
He needs help.	Jeħtieġ l-għajnuna.
No one is ever good or bad.	Ħadd mhu qatt tajjeb jew ħażin.
Most people have.	Ħafna nies għandhom.
I'm still surprised.	Għadni sorpriż.
I had no way to try	Ma kellix mod biex nipprova
I was thinking about this as well.	Jien kont qed naħseb dwar dan ukoll.
That's not easy.	Dak mhux faċli.
They are quite.	Huma pjuttost.
I didn’t want to do that	Ma ridtx nagħmel dan
He had to get home.	Kellu jasal id-dar.
I just said it could	Għidt biss li jista’
I wasn't sure what to say.	Ma kontx eżatt x’se ngħid.
That if they do anything.	Dak jekk jagħmlu xejn.
She had had enough.	Kellha biżżejjed.
But there is no way to understand.	Imma m'hemm l-ebda mod biex nifhem.
I was also having fun now	Jien ukoll kont qed nieħu gost issa
I have to get along with him	Ikolli nagħmel tajjeb miegħu
I have more than enough	Għandi aktar minn biżżejjed
I already know what he was going to say	Diġà naf x'kien se tgħid
I have an idea.	Jien għandi idea.
I didn’t even know that much about it	Lanqas kont naf daqshekk dwarha
I will never do that again	Qatt mhu se nerġa’ nagħmel dan
I was not able to do that	Ma kontx kapaċi nagħmel dan
Well, this is better than nothing.	Ukoll, dan huwa aħjar minn xejn.
It was something we knew.	Kienet xi ħaġa li konna nafu.
We have this.	Għandna dan.
That would have been easy.	Dan kien ikun faċli.
I doubt it.	Niddubita dan.
We are nothing.	Aħna xejn.
I was hoping you could tell	Kont nittama li tista’ tgħidli
I shouldn’t say anything wrong about it.	M'għandi ngħid xejn ħażin dwarha.
I thought it might be something	Ħsibt li tista 'tkun xi ħaġa
It has been many years.	Kienu ħafna snin.
I didn't have to tell you that	Jien ma kellix ngħidlek hekk
He could not hold back.	Ma setax joqgħod lura.
Nothing like this has happened.	Xejn bħal dan ma ġie.
I'll be back tomorrow evening	Jien ser immur lura għada filgħaxija
Many times.	Ħafna drabi.
I don’t want to know anymore.	Ma rridx inkun naf aktar.
I couldn’t tell where exactly he was coming from	Ma stajtx ngħid minn fejn kien ġej eżatt
I was doing well to say	Kont qed nagħmel tajjeb biex ngħid
I wonder why he did that	Nistaqsi għaliex għamel hekk
I couldn't see or hear anything	Ma stajt nara jew nisma’ xejn
I was, of course, too young to be there	Jien, ovvjament, kont żgħir wisq biex kont hemm
It wasn’t hard to do that.	Ma kienx diffiċli li tagħmel dan.
It's still there.	Għadu hemm.
As it were.	Kif kien.
Come to me as you are.	Ejja għandi kif int.
I thought everyone took one	Ħsibt li kulħadd ħa wieħed
How and when.	Kif u meta.
I can't say what you're thinking	Ma nistax ngħid x'qed taħseb
I was alone	Ġejt waħdi
We are not together.	Aħna mhux flimkien.
I can’t say they were doing things	Ma nistax ngħid li kienu qed jagħmlu l-affarijiet
I'm afraid to tell you	Nibża ngħidlek
Everyone is already tired.	Kulħadd diġà għajjien.
I thought about it	Ħsibt dwar dan
I couldn’t have that	Ma setax ikolli dak
Look out.	Ħares barra.
Nothing like this happened.	Ma ġara xejn bħal dan.
I have to tell you about the car	Għandi ngħidlek dwar il-karozza
It comes alone.	Jiġi waħdu.
It just works.	Jaħdem biss.
It may have been just before his time.	Jista’ jkun li kien ftit qabel iż-żmien tiegħu.
I have one, too.	Ikolli waħda, ukoll.
She left.	Hija telaq.
I just want to go there	Irrid biss immur hemm
I couldn’t believe he was doing this to me	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien qed jagħmel dan miegħi
But we know.	Imma nafu.
I want to stand up for you.	Irrid noqgħod għalik.
I think this will work	Naħseb li dan se jaħdem
It works well for me.	Jaħdem tajjeb għalija.
And it doesn’t look like it’s been there that long.	U ma jidhirx li kien ilu hemm daqshekk twil.
I wasn’t sure what to say	Ma kontx ċert x'se ngħid
I would like to do this more often	Nixtieq li tagħmel dan aktar spiss
I couldn't go any further	Ma stajtx immur aktar
Really, really good.	Tassew, tassew tajjeb.
I tell you this a lot.	Jien ngħidlek dan ħafna.
I hope it goes well.	Nittama li jmur tajjeb.
I can’t do another one like that	Ma nistax nagħmel oħra bħal dik
It was, in fact.	Kien, fil-fatt.
He said the following	Huwa qal dan li ġej
It happened very late.	Ġara tard ħafna.
I can do whatever you want	Nista’ nagħmel dak li trid tkun
I didn’t want to talk about it.	Ma ridtx nitkellem dwar dan.
I thought better of you.	Kont ħsibt aħjar għalik.
He said very little.	Qal ftit li xejn.
I need you to tell me	Għandi bżonn li tgħidli
He seemed to be just there.	Deher li kien qiegħed biss hemm.
I try to do what is right	Nipprova nagħmel dak li hu tajjeb
And for you.	U għalik.
It's hard to see why.	Huwa diffiċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
I haven’t seen anyone else.	Jien ma rajt lil ħadd ieħor.
I was going to buy everything there	Kont se nixtri kollox hemmhekk
She was the first.	Hija kienet l-ewwel.
It wasn’t like that for us.	Ma kienx hekk għalina.
More on that later.	Aktar dwar dan aktar tard.
I'm scared, he thought.	Nibża, ħaseb.
I just wanted to see what I was capable of	Ridt biss nara dak li kont kapaċi
It was something.	Kienet xi ħaġa.
I have to do something nice for him	Ikolli nagħmel xi ħaġa sabiħa għalih
It shouldn't be here.	M'għandux ikun hawn.
We have to do it or not.	Irridu nagħmlu dan jew le.
I will say this only once.	Jien se ngħid dan darba biss.
I was back soon	Kelli lura malajr
About everything.	Dwar kollox.
It actually does nothing.	Fil-fatt ma jagħmel xejn.
I would like to talk to him	Nixtieq nitkellem miegħu
We had nothing.	Ma kellna xejn.
That’s all he needed.	Dak hu kollu li kellu bżonn.
None of this could have happened.	Xejn minn dan seta’ ġara.
You time it.	Inti ħin dan.
No, it's really not.	Le, huwa verament mhux.
I will not do so.	Jien mhux se nagħmel hekk.
I can’t believe it’s actually mine	Ma nistax nemmen li hu fil-fatt tiegħi
I really, very much regret it.	Jien tassew, ħafna jiddispjaċini.
But today, here we are.	Imma llum, hawn aħna.
Maybe I’m doing something wrong.	Forsi qed nagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina.
This happened, of course.	Dan ġara, ovvjament.
Maybe he didn’t have one.	Forsi ma kellux wieħed.
She makes a lot more money than we do.	Hi tagħmel ħafna aktar flus milli nagħmlu aħna.
But for how long.	Imma għal kemm żmien.
You are not.	M'intix.
What they are not doing.	Dak li qed jagħmlu mhux.
He has been doing this for a long time.	Ilu jagħmel dan.
It seems to be working.	Jidher li qed jaħdem.
What is there.	X'inhu hemm.
It's pretty big.	Huwa pjuttost kbir.
That was better.	Dak kien aħjar.
I wasn't expecting anything.	Ma kont nistenna għal xejn.
I had to go before	I kellha tmur qabel
I will do whatever you want	Jien se nagħmel dak kollu li tixtieq
I didn’t want to go to this school	Ma ridtx immur din l-iskola
I can seem, actually	I jista 'jidher, fil-fatt
I did a lot of things	Għamilt ħafna affarijiet
This may take some time.	Dan jista' jieħu xi żmien.
I have to be with you	Għandi nkun miegħek
Tomorrow maybe I don’t know.	Għada forsi ma nafx.
And it doesn't.	U m’għandux.
I had to understand everything on my own	Kelli nifhem kollox waħdi
The work I did	Ix-xogħol għamilt jien
I knew there were better things out there now	Kont naf li issa kien hemm affarijiet aħjar hemmhekk
When it happened, it happened really fast.	Meta ġara, ġara tassew malajr.
Well, everything else.	Ukoll, kull ħaġa oħra.
I can't get you back anymore	Ma nistax lura inti aktar
I was with some friends	Kont ma’ xi ħbieb
It's really easy.	Huwa verament faċli.
I really think so.	Jien tassew naħseb hekk.
I see a lot of people	Nara ħafna nies
I just don’t know enough.	Jien biss ma nafx biżżejjed.
She is very beautiful.	Hija sabiħa ħafna.
They are really better.	Huma verament aħjar.
But it was not so.	Imma ma kienx hekk.
For years now.	Għal snin issa.
Not only that.	Mhux hekk biss.
That wasn’t for me.	Dak ma kienx għalija.
It never was and never will be.	Qatt ma kien u qatt ma kien se jkun.
I have no idea why this is happening so fast	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex dan qed jiġri daqshekk malajr
He was a great idea man.	Huwa kien raġel idea kbira.
I really didn’t want to believe it	Verament ma ridtx nemmen
But that was my job.	Imma dak kien ix-xogħol tiegħi.
I thought about it, too.	Ħsibt dwar dan, ukoll.
Work, you say.	Xogħol, tgħid.
Rarely is it not	Ftit drabi ma jkunx
No one was right.	Ħadd ma kellu raġun.
This is the same thing.	Din hija l-istess ħaġa.
I didn’t want to go back to that	Ma ridtx immur lura għal dak
I have been for a long time	Ilni għal żmien twil
I never thought too much about it	Qatt ma ħsibt wisq dwarha
He was doing well.	Huwa kien jagħmel tajjeb.
I can’t just be friends	Jien ma nistax inkun biss ħbieb
I make a lot of money	Nagħmel ħafna flus
That could be coming.	Dak jista’ jkun ġej.
He is doing nothing.	Mhu qed jagħmel xejn.
It's too good.	Huwa tajjeb wisq.
I want you to be happy, always	Irrid li tkun kuntent, dejjem
I hope as soon as possible.	Nittama kemm jista' jkun malajr.
But I think I did too	Imma naħseb li għamilt ukoll
It would be easy.	Ikun faċli.
And there we were.	U hemmhekk konna.
I was so scared of someone coming	Tant kont nibża’ li jiġi xi ħadd
I knew there had to be something	Kont naf li kellu jkun hemm xi ħaġa
I still had nothing to say	Għadni ma kellix xi ngħid
It makes me fun.	Jagħmel lili gost.
As you are now.	Kif int issa.
It could be anything, really.	Jista 'jkun xi ħaġa, tassew.
I just hope it wasn’t too bad or too late	Jien biss nittama li ma kienx ħażin wisq jew tard wisq
I didn’t want to.	Ma ridtx.
No one knew who we were.	Ħadd ma kien jaf min konna.
I think we were like that.	Naħseb li konna hekk.
I wasn’t sure it was ever there	Ma kontx ċert li qatt kien hemm
I was never sure.	Qatt ma kont ċert.
I haven't waited for a long time	Ilni ma nistenna
I think we would be better off together	Naħseb li nkunu aħjar flimkien
She was back.	Kienet lura.
There is nothing good about it.	M'hemm xejn tajjeb fuq.
It seems like the first one came out forever ago.	Jidher li l-ewwel wieħed ħareġ għal dejjem ilu.
Its all the time.	Il-ħin kollu tiegħu.
I will say something about what is happening to me	Ngħid xi ħaġa dwar dak li qed jiġri miegħi
This can take a long time.	Dan jista 'jieħu żmien twil.
It can be great.	Jista 'jkun kbir.
He had died for me.	Huwa kien miet għalija.
I was a great man.	Jien kont raġel kbir.
I thought you can’t be from here.	Ħsibt li ma tistax tkun minn hawn.
I hope you can as well	Qed nittama li inti tista 'kif hekk
I didn’t really want to think about it	Ma tantx ridt naħseb
We have this too.	Għandna dan ukoll.
I need to do it tonight	Għandi bżonn li tagħmel illejla
Boy! 	Tifel!
I have seen it before.	Rajt qabel.
This can happen a few times in a row.	Dan jista 'jiġri ftit drabi wara xulxin.
We know that now.	Nafu li issa.
I think you should do the same	Naħseb li għandek tagħmel l-istess
Now, not so much.	Issa, mhux daqshekk.
I'm not.	Jien ma.
That was hours ago.	Dan kien sigħat ilu.
I would do the same	Nixtieq nagħmel l-istess
But she was not there.	Imma hi ma kinitx hemm.
I should have known that something like this would come	I kellha tkun naf li xi ħaġa bħal din se tiġi
Nothing works.	Xejn ma jaħdem.
But it has to be done.	Imma jrid isir.
But it's just me.	Imma jien biss jien.
Not after today.	Mhux wara llum.
But not here.	Imma mhux hawn.
I really loved it only once	Verament kont inħobb darba biss
There is something else.	Hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
Not for him.	Mhux għalih.
There is a lot around here.	Hemm ħafna madwar hawn.
I was worried he might not make it back	Kont inkwetat li forsi ma tagħmilx lura
And what they were doing.	U dak li kienu jagħmlu.
I want you to say nothing	Irrid li ma tgħid xejn
Apparently, she did the same with him.	Milli jidher, hi għamlet l-istess miegħu.
I'm afraid he did	Nibża li għamel
She didn't know what to say.	Ma tantx kienet taf x’qed tgħid.
As we should know.	Kif għandna nkunu nafu.
I was here a few times, many years ago	Kont hawn ftit drabi, ħafna snin ilu
I went to talk to you, but you weren't there	Mort nitkellem miegħek, imma int ma kontx hemm
I needed that.	Jien kelli bżonn dan.
I saw things.	Rajt affarijiet.
I'm not your friend or anything	Jien mhux ħabib tiegħek jew xi ħaġa
We will be back.	Se nkunu lura.
I can expect so much	Nista' nistenna daqshekk
I want to be a better person.	Irrid inkun persuna aħjar.
This was very, very bad.	Dan kien ħażin ħafna, ħafna.
He has to go with you.	Huwa għandu jmur miegħek.
I had thought about it before, but not so.	Kont ħsibt qabel, imma mhux hekk.
That will be us.	Dik se nkunu aħna.
I don’t understand why this is so	Jien mhux qed nifhem għaliex dan hu hekk
It did.	Dan għamlet.
So have we.	Hekk għandna aħna.
I don't know.	Ma nafx.
I didn’t even want to say anything else	Lanqas ridt li jgħid xi ħaġa oħra
That she was tired.	Li kienet għajjien.
All of us.	Kollha kemm aħna.
Or you already know the truth.	Jew diġà taf il-verità.
Not that it actually is.	Mhux li fil-fatt hu.
Lots of work.	Ħafna xogħol.
I don’t know what it is.	Ma nafx x'inhu.
I hope this will not be difficult	Nispera li dan mhux se jkun diffiċli
Well, lately it's been hard.	Tajjeb, dan l-aħħar huwa diffiċli.
I did just that.	Jien għamilt eżatt hekk.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Kollox deher sejjer tajjeb.
I want to be.	Irrid inkun.
I had been for a while.	Kont ġejt għal ftit.
I want to know what's going on	Irrid inkun naf x’qed jiġri
That was good.	Dan kien tajjeb.
I think that's enough	Naħseb li huwa biżżejjed
Look at that.	Ħares lejn dak.
I thought they were friends	Kont naħseb li kienu ħbieb
How long he had been out, where he was, he could not tell.	Kemm kien ilu barra, fejn kien, ma setax jgħid.
I would like to see that	Nixtieq nara dak
Your time is not now.	Il-ħin tiegħek mhuwiex issa.
I want so much to be with you	Irrid tant inkun miegħek
My time was a little off.	Il-ħin tiegħi kien ftit barra.
So it will always be.	Hekk ikun dejjem.
Nor was it.	Lanqas ma kien.
You will be ready before you know it.	Int tkun lest qabel ma tkun taf.
I can't wait	Ma nistax nistenna
I knew it was going to be hard	Kont naf li se jkun diffiċli
He is still with us.	Għadu hawn magħna.
I did nothing for you	Jien ma għamilt xejn għalik
I can't believe what he did to me	Lanqas nista’ nemmen dak li għamel miegħi
He knows it is not.	Hu jaf li mhix.
There is more out there.	Hemm aktar hemmhekk.
You just need to do something.	Għandek bżonn biss tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I don’t take anything	Jien ma nieħu xejn
I was and wouldn’t come	Jien kont u ma kienx jiġi
No one ever knew how they felt.	Ħadd qatt ma kien ikun jaf kif ħassu.
That was a great thing	Dik kienet xi ħaġa kbira
There had to be a better way.	Kellu jkun hemm mod aħjar.
Anything can happen, boy.	Jista' jiġri kollox, tifel.
I wanted to do everything that goes	Ridt nagħmel dak kollu li jmur
I was surprised, though	Kont sorpriż, imma
But it’s time for that.	Imma wasal iż-żmien għal dan.
I’m trying to say the same thing.	Qed nipprova ngħid l-istess ħaġa.
I thought I was the problem, not me	Ħsibt li kont il-problema, mhux jien
You know.	Inti taf.
Plan to do this more.	Tippjana li tagħmel dan aktar.
I just wanted to be quick	Ridt biss li jkun malajr
I knew this was going to happen	Kont naf li dan kien se jiġri
He never knew who he was	Hu qatt ma kien jaf min hu
I really am.	Jien tassew.
It can’t be very easy.	Ma jistax ikun faċli ħafna.
I think he’s just scared.	Naħseb li hu biss jibża.
It wasn't great.	Ma kienx kbir.
And she was talking.	U kienet qed titkellem.
The dog too.	Il-kelb ukoll.
I was happy with that.	Kont kuntent b'dan.
I wanted the same thing	Ridt l-istess ħaġa
It was a really, really hard time for me.	Kien żmien tassew, tassew diffiċli għalija.
'year'.	'sena'.
I’m not saying anything.	Jien ma ngħid xejn.
A long time ago.	Minn żmien twil ilu.
I just want to be okay	Irrid biss li tkun tajjeb
I just need something.	Għandi bżonn biss xi ħaġa.
The same thing can happen.	L-istess jista' jiġri.
I wanted one myself.	Jien ridt waħda jien.
That's what he always does.	Dak hu dejjem jagħmel.
It was time for him to do the same.	Kien wasal iż-żmien għalih li jagħmel l-istess.
I think that’s enough.	Naħseb li huwa biżżejjed.
I know you want to know something	Naf li trid tkun taf xi ħaġa
There were some other things.	Kien hemm xi affarijiet oħra.
I can’t do it for both of us	Ma nistax nagħmel għalina t-tnejn
I can do anything for anyone	Kapaċi nagħmel kollox għal kulħadd
It would have been so beautiful.	Kienet tkun daqshekk sabiħa.
I can't do anything wrong	Ma nista nagħmel xejn ħażin
I can't believe it.	Ma nistax nemmen.
He has no idea what will happen next.	M’għandux idea x’se jiġi.
I can't tell you more than that	Ma nistax ngħidlek aktar minn hekk
Maybe he just can't.	Forsi jista 'biss.
But she knew better now.	Imma hi kienet taf aħjar issa.
That was what he was doing, really.	Kien dak li kien qed jagħmel, tassew.
I didn’t have more time for that	Ma kellix aktar ħin għal dak
I never saw anything	Qatt ma rajt xejn
There is no way to really.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li verament.
And that’s just what we know about it.	U dik hija biss dik li nafu dwarha.
I have a lot of these	Għandi ħafna minn dawn
I want to talk to you	Irrid nitkellem miegħek
Every little bit helps !.	Kull ftit jgħin!.
You are a great person.	Int persuna kbira.
Everyone who was someone.	Kulħadd li kien xi ħadd.
He looked small.	Huwa deher żgħir.
So easy for me.	Hekk faċli għalija.
I wonder where he is	Nistaqsi fejn hu
Or that everything works.	Jew li kollox jaħdem.
I'll see you all again	Jien nerġa’ nara lil kulħadd
I couldn’t think too much about it	Ma stajtx naħseb wisq dwarha
But to yours.	Imma lil tiegħek.
I thought it was a good idea at the time	Ħsibt li kienet idea tajba dak iż-żmien
I just thought maybe you want to know.	Ħsibt biss li forsi trid tkun taf.
I know what I wanted	Naf li dak li ridt
It is now or never.	Huwa issa jew qatt.
I know nothing about it	Jien ma naf xejn dwarha
I have everything tonight	Għandi kollox illejla
I just still.	Għadni biss.
I was as happy as I could be	Kont kuntent kif jista’ jkun
Until he told someone it was just his.	Sakemm qal lil xi ħadd li kien biss tiegħu.
I can take this myself	Jien nista' nieħu dan jien
I am doing the same	Qed nagħmel l-istess
I want to be me again	Irrid inkun jien mill-ġdid
Before you go too far.	Qabel ma tmur wisq.
Nothing is ready.	Xejn mhu lest.
I know how it should look	Naf kif dan għandu jidher
Everything else was fine.	Kollox ieħor kien tajjeb.
He didn't know if he had time.	Ma kienx jaf jekk kellux ħin.
It may still be around.	Jista 'jkun għadu madwar.
I will say more about this later.	I se ngħid aktar dwar dan aktar tard.
I never had to	Qatt ma kelli għalfejn irrid
I make you something to eat	Jiena nagħmel inti xi ħaġa li tiekol
I have been doing this for many years	Qed nagħmel dan għal ħafna snin
But it didn’t have to be.	Imma ma kellux ikun.
It’s too much for me.	Huwa wisq għalija.
In fact, it was.	Fil-fatt, kien.
He was too tired to talk anymore.	Kien għajjien wisq biex jitkellem aktar.
At the time, it looked like this.	Dak iż-żmien, deher bħal dan.
That is actually happening.	Dak fil-fatt qed jiġri.
How everyone is doing the same thing.	Kif kulħadd qed jagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
Survive they do not.	Jgħix dawn ma.
Everything works fine.	Kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
It wasn’t, he said.	Ma kienx, qal.
And everything will be just that.	U kollox se jkun biss.
I’m not sure what happened there, but something.	M'inix ċert x'ġara hemm, imma xi ħaġa.
Too much reason was.	Raġun wisq kienet.
I think it was great	Naħseb li kien kbir
It's so bad.	Huwa daqshekk ħażin.
He knew everything and everyone.	Kien jaf kollox u lil kulħadd.
It made everything really easy.	Għamel kollox verament faċli.
As she had.	Kif kellha hi.
I’ve been here before.	Jien kont hawn qabel.
It’s still like a lot of things about it.	Għadu bħal ħafna affarijiet dwarha.
Come as you are.	Ejja kif int.
I want to go there.	Irrid immur hemmhekk.
This is not that.	Din mhix dik.
I had to go home	I kellha tmur id-dar
I'm not sure why.	M'inix ċert għaliex.
Not even the next one.	Lanqas dak ta’ wara.
I heard.	Smajt.
I was not there for you	Jien ma kontx hemm għalik
She has done this many times before.	Hija għamlet dan ħafna drabi qabel.
I was wondering about	Kont nistaqsi madwar
I knew he was trying to figure out what was wrong	Kont naf li kien qed jipprova jara x’kien ħażin
I didn’t have to do this alone	Ma kellix għalfejn nagħmel dan waħdi
It was good for everyone.	Kien tajjeb għal kulħadd.
I wish there was more than that.	Nixtieq li jkun hemm aktar minn hekk.
I can’t take much more than that	Ma nistax nieħu ħafna aktar minn dan
Glad you're here.	Ferħan int hawn.
I know exactly what you are doing	Naf eżatt x'qed tagħmel
And I do, of course.	U jien, ovvjament.
That’s not a problem.	Dik mhix problema.
I thought about that too	Ħsibt dwar dan ukoll
And this was not the case.	U dan ma kienx hekk.
I'll talk.	Jien ser nitkellem.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
I can't wait any longer	Ma nistax nistenna aktar
But he did.	Imma hekk għamel.
I didn’t want to go back there anymore	Ma ridtx immur lura hemm aktar
I understand how this	Nifhem kif dan
I believe you have something to tell me.	Nemmen li għandek xi tgħidli.
I really need to know how to do this	I verament bżonn inkun naf kif nagħmel dan
You don't see it.	Inti ma jidhirx.
I definitely didn’t want to	Żgur li ma ridtx
But there was no chance now.	Imma ma kienx hemm ċans issa.
I will not be helpful.	Mhux se nkun ta' għajnuna.
I know this is difficult for you right now	Naf li dan huwa diffiċli għalik bħalissa
I didn’t need other people	Ma kellix bżonn nies oħra
Obviously he knows.	Ovvjament jaf.
She knows that.	Hija taf li.
You’re not thinking about it.	Mhux qed taħseb dwarha.
I hope it goes well with you.	Nittama li tmur tajjeb miegħek.
It will be very difficult for you.	Se tkun diffiċli ħafna għalik.
I want this.	Jien irrid din.
I can't seem to see anything	Jidher li ma nista nara xejn
And now you're here.	U issa int hawn.
And here too.	U hawn ukoll.
He thought he knew everything about her.	Huwa ħaseb li kien jaf kollox dwarha.
I can’t wait to tell you about it	Ma nistax nistenna li ngħidlek dwarha
I'm good here.	Jien tajjeb hawn.
I didn’t even know it	Jien lanqas kont naf
I didn’t have many friends	Ma kellix ħafna ħbieb
I went too.	Jien mort ukoll.
I just couldn't wait.	I biss ma stajtx nistenna.
I know nothing about it.	Ma naf xejn dwarha.
It's yours.	Hu tiegħek.
I can’t wait that long	Ma nistax nistenna daqshekk
Don't have another job? 	M'għandekx xogħol ieħor?
Sure, everyone is.	Żgur, kulħadd hu.
It seems to be working.	Jidher li qed jaħdem.
I knew exactly what he was going to do tonight	Kont naf eżatt x’kien se jkun qed jagħmel illejla
But that was a long time ago	Imma dak kien żmien twil ilu
Much more, but not with us	Ħafna aktar, imma mhux magħna
And maybe he does.	U forsi jagħmel hekk.
I couldn't go to school today	Illum ma stajtx immur l-iskola
I am so good	Jiena daqshekk tajjeb
He looked at the door.	Huwa ħares lejn il-bieb.
But she can't.	Imma hi ma tistax.
There will be no more.	Mhux se jkun hemm aktar.
I couldn't believe it was her	Ma stajtx nemmen li kienet hi
I want to be more than sure	Irrid inkun aktar minn ċert
I have to think about it	Ikolli naħseb dwarha
But this cannot be.	Imma dan ma jistax ikun.
I just want to talk to you	Irrid nitkellem miegħek biss
Obviously you know nothing about it.	Ovvjament ma taf xejn dwarha.
But not much.	Imma mhux ħafna.
I once did that	Darba għamilt dan jien
That’s just what you do.	Dak hu biss dak li tagħmel.
More now than ever.	Aktar issa minn qatt qabel.
I understand that.	Jien nifhem dan.
This was not.	Dan ma kienx.
This should not be so difficult.	Dan m'għandux ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
Not just good.	Mhux biss tajjeb.
If anything, it seemed like nothing.	Jekk xejn, deher li xejn.
There is more, of course.	Hemm aktar, ovvjament.
I was telling you	Jien kont ngħidlek
Or if you want.	Jew jekk tridx.
I had to know the truth	Kelli nkun naf il-verità
I hadn’t done anything wrong either	Lanqas kont għamilt xejn ħażin
It’s pretty good to go with me.	Huwa pjuttost tajjeb li jmur miegħi.
I have some friends here	Għandi xi ħbieb hawn
It was so great.	Kien daqshekk kbir.
No he wasn't.	Le hu ma kienx.
No, no, not us.	Le, le, mhux aħna.
Or, as you say.	Jew, kif tgħid int.
I can't do much	Ma nista’ nagħmel ħafna minn xejn
No one ever leaves.	Ħadd qatt ma jitlaq.
Its time has come.	Wasal iż-żmien tiegħu.
He actually said so	Huwa fil-fatt qal hekk
I was a little surprised but happy	Kont xi ftit sorpriż imma kuntent
The timing was not good.	Il-ħin ma kienx tajjeb.
Never enough, he thought.	Qatt biżżejjed, ħaseb.
For one there, there was too much.	Għal wieħed hemm, kien hemm wisq.
He always, it had seemed to me, was as his.	Huwa dejjem, kien deher lili, kien kif tiegħu.
I have been there for a very long time.	Kont qiegħed hemm għal żmien twil ħafna.
I probably never will	I probabbilment qatt
What just happened.	Dak li għadu kif ġara.
I'm ready for.	Jien lest għal.
I couldn't understand that	Ma stajtx nifhem hekk
This is just a man.	Dan huwa biss raġel.
I don't know who he is	Ma nafx min hu
I was never there to see it.	Qatt ma kont hemm biex nara.
I don't know.	Ma nafx.
This will not be.	Dan mhux se jkun.
It will be a good time.	Se jkun żmien tajjeb.
I have been doing a lot of work	Ilni nagħmel ħafna xogħol
Everything can wait.	Kollox jista’ jistenna.
You should know that.	Għandek tkun taf li.
I don’t have to go long	M'għandix inkun immur twil
I wonder if he is happy.	Nistaqsi jekk hux kuntent.
I didn’t know what to believe anymore	Ma kontx naf x'se nemmen aktar
I heard nothing more	Ma smajt xejn aktar
I was so tired last night	Kont tant għajjien ilbieraħ filgħaxija
He thought about how happy he was where he was.	Ħaseb dwar kif kien kuntent fejn kien.
This had not happened before.	Dan ma kienx ġara qabel.
I thought everything was fine	Ħsibt li kollox kien tajjeb
I think we can do much better.	Naħseb li nistgħu nagħmlu ħafna aħjar.
I want you to know that nothing happened last night	Irrid li tkun taf xejn ma ġara lbieraħ filgħaxija
We were doing something else at the time.	Konna qed nagħmlu xi ħaġa oħra dak iż-żmien.
I was with him on that	Jien kont miegħu fuq dak
The time is always now.	Iż-żmien huwa dejjem issa.
He was often seen there.	Kien jidher spiss hemmhekk.
In fact it was not.	Fil-fatt ma kienx.
Supposedly I know.	Suppost li naf.
I can hear.	Nista’ nisma’.
I really didn’t want that	Jien verament ma ridtx dan
I would say, enough.	Jien ngħid, biżżejjed.
You have everything.	Għandek kollox'.
I can't say exactly where they are from	Ma nistax ngħid eżatt minn fejn huma
And it won't either.	U dan mhux se lanqas.
I hope you are well too.	Nittama li int tajjeb ukoll.
He knows what's going on.	Jaf x'qed jiġri.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
I will try that.	Se nipprova hekk.
I knew nothing of what he wanted	Jien ma kont naf xejn minn dak li ried
Above all, it is something we do often.	Fuq kollox, hija xi ħaġa li nagħmlu spiss.
I think I said enough.	Naħseb li għidt biżżejjed.
I always have something to say	Dejjem għandi xi ngħid
It wasn't just him.	Ma kienx hu biss.
Whatever we had, it wasn’t good enough.	Tkun xi tkun kellna, ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed.
I have nothing more to say here	M'għandi xejn aktar xi ngħid hawn
I didn’t know there were such things	Ma kontx naf li kien hemm affarijiet bħal dawn
You were the last one.	Inti kont l-aħħar wieħed.
You seem to be a beautiful person.	Inti tidher li tkun persuna sabiħa.
I try a lot.	Nipprova ħafna.
If you are interested.	Jekk inti interessat.
I never seemed to have that problem before I left	Qatt ma deher li kelli dik il-problema qabel ma mort
I'm very sorry	Jiddispjaċini ħafna
A few times.	Ftit darba.
I can’t take it anymore.	Ma nistax nieħu aktar.
I went with him for one	Jien mort miegħu għal wieħed
It's not too late.	Għadu mhux tard wisq.
Would it really be that hard ?.	Ikun verament daqshekk diffiċli?.
I want to know exactly what happened	Irrid inkun naf eżatt x'ġara
I can't say.	Ma nistax ngħid.
Not really.	Mhux verament.
It will never happen.	Hekk se jiġri qatt.
It's really done.	Huwa verament isir.
I have never heard of it	Qatt ma smajt aktar dwarha
I understand why you came	Nifhem għaliex ġejt
She did as he had done.	Hija għamlet kif kien għamel hu.
This is way, much better.	Dan huwa mod, ħafna aħjar.
He looked like a little boy.	Kien qisu tifel żgħir.
I have one myself.	Għandi waħda jien.
Look at that house.	Ħares lejn dik id-dar.
I had no idea who she was	Ma kellix idea min kienet
I didn't know what he was thinking	Ma kontx naf x’qed jaħseb
I hadn’t thought about that.	Jien ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan.
One year later, another	Sena wara, oħra
He did so today.	Illum hekk għamel.
And before that.	U qabel dan.
I'm not one.	Jien mhux wieħed.
I hope it wasn’t too big	Jien nittama li ma kienx kbir wisq
I needed to see this	Kelli bżonn nara dan
I also think this is a great idea	Naħseb ukoll li din hija idea kbira
No, he wants to go.	Le, irid imur.
I had had enough of this	Kelli biżżejjed minn dan
I'm that someone.	Jien dak xi ħadd.
He is scared.	Huwa jibża.
Whatever it is, he is right.	Jgħid x’inhu, għandu raġun.
I knew exactly what he was thinking	Kont naf eżatt x’kien qed jaħseb
Whatever you can be sure of.	Tkun xi tkun tista' tkun ċert minni.
I know now that it is once, not if.	Naf issa li hija darba, mhux jekk.
No one knew why.	Ħadd ma kien jaf għaliex.
When the time comes.	Meta wasal iż-żmien.
I can see how happy you are here	Nista' nara kemm int kuntent hawn
I'll get back to that later	Se nerġa 'lura għal dan aktar tard
That said nothing on the outside.	Dan ma qal xejn fuq barra.
I thought we had something	Ħsibt li kellna xi ħaġa
I think it’s great and all	Naħseb li huwa kbir u dak kollu
I'm all you can be	Jien dak kollu li tista’ tkun
I couldn’t understand what was going on, or why	Ma stajtx nifhem x'kien qed jiġri, jew għaliex
It has everything.	Għandu kollox.
I know you know.	Naf li taf.
Where he or she was.	Fejn kien hu jew hi.
You can't go back.	Ma tistax tmur lura.
I won’t say more about it today.	Mhux se ngħid aktar dwarha llum.
It felt pretty good.	Ħassu pjuttost tajjeb.
That only once.	Dik darba biss.
Something after that is unnecessary for me.	Xi ħaġa wara dik hija bla bżonn għalija.
I never do anything early.	Qatt ma nagħmel xejn kmieni.
I have no idea why he is here	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex hu hawn
I should know better, of course	Għandi naf aħjar, ovvjament
It's for you.	Huwa għalik.
There really is.	Hemm verament.
I couldn't say for sure	Ma stajtx ngħid għal ċert
I have to go see someone about my things	Ikolli mmur nara lil xi ħadd dwar l-affarijiet tiegħi
But so it was.	Imma hekk kien.
are you 	hu int?
I always had to do it alone	Dejjem kelli nagħmel dan waħdi
the.	le.
Or something wrong.	Jew xi ħaġa ħażina.
I was ready for that	Jien kont lest għal dan
I could never do that.	Qatt ma stajt nagħmel hekk.
I can't do anything here.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn hawn.
I want you to know everything	Irrid li tkun taf kollox
And that would be enough.	U dan ikun biżżejjed.
There was no better tomorrow.	Ma kienx hemm aħjar għada.
But that was years ago now.	Imma dak kien snin ilu issa.
I was so scared I was scared again.	Kont tant nibża’ li nerġa’ nibża’.
Nobody around tonight.	Ħadd madwar illejla.
I know you are a good man.	Naf li inti għal raġel tajjeb.
I can think of a few.	Nista' naħseb fi ftit.
You will be easy.	Int tkun faċli.
I didn’t have time for that	Ma kellix ħin għal dan
A little of everything	Ftit minn kollox
I really need to try more	Verament għandi bżonn nipprova aktar
But for me.	Imma għalija.
It does not.	Dan ma jagħmilx.
I thought it was pretty good	Ħsibt li kien pjuttost tajjeb
He would never be great.	Hu qatt ma jkun kbir.
I didn’t see anything afterwards	Ma rajt xejn wara
You can be alone or with someone else.	Tista' tkun waħdek jew ma' xi ħadd ieħor.
I couldn't believe it.	Ma stajtx nemmen dan.
I’m not saying you.	Jien mhux qed ngħid int.
I'm happy with that	Jien kuntent b'dan
It takes a year to do.	Tieħu sena biex tagħmel.
This is not an easy task.	Din mhix xi ħaġa faċli.
I wasn’t having fun	Jien ma kontx qed nieħu gost
He may be back in a long time.	Huwa jista 'jkun lura fi żmien twil.
Or you don’t have one.	Jew m'għandekx waħda.
He loved to play	Kien iħobb jilgħab
I can't say that.	Ma nistax ngħid hekk.
He was the only one.	Kien l-uniku wieħed.
Probably nothing, but he couldn't be sure.	Probabbilment xejn, imma ma setax ikun ċert.
And much more.	U ħafna aktar.
I couldn't do anything.	Ma stajt nagħmel xejn.
And you are right.	U għandek raġun.
After that I heard nothing	Wara dan ma smajt xejn
I don't want anything.	Ma rrid xejn.
Maybe it was nothing.	Forsi ma kien xejn.
One here and another there.	Wieħed hawn u ieħor hemm.
I didn’t know about it	Ma kontx naf dwarha
I see he won’t do, nothing	Nara li mhux se tagħmel, xejn
Good work helps	Xogħol tajjeb jgħin
He loved that she did so	Iħobb ħafna li hi għamlet hekk
This seems to work.	Dan jidher li jaħdem.
Where was he now ?.	Fejn kien issa?.
I didn’t want to wait	Ma ridtx nistenna
It was like a long time, sure.	Kien qisu żmien twil, żgur.
I can't go back that far	Ma nistax immur lura daqshekk
I wanted to be here for you	Jien ridt inkun hawn għalik
For that may be.	Għal li jista 'jkun.
I thought it was great	Ħsibt li kien kbir
I’m good at this.	Jien tajjeb b'dan.
I must have passed out	I għandu jkun għadda barra
But only so.	Imma biss hekk.
I was so glad for him to be home	Kont tant ferħan għalih li jkun id-dar
Only, you know, if you're interested.	Biss, taf, jekk int interessat.
I moved here a year ago	Jien mort hawn sena ilu
And he was right.	U kellu raġun.
Not much more.	Mhux wisq aktar.
I never thought so	Qatt ma kont naħseb hekk
I just didn’t want to talk	Jien biss ma ridtx nitkellem
I can do something for you.	Nista’ nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik.
Tomorrow there is again.	Għada hemm mill-ġdid.
You see that.	Inti tara li.
He wasn’t sure ever.	Ma kienx ċert li qatt.
I need to do something	Għandi bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa
I wasn’t having any of that	Jien ma kont qed ikolli xejn minn hekk
Maybe you are not.	Forsi m'intix.
I’m nothing and he’s everything.	Jien xejn u hu kollox.
This is actually happening.	Dan fil-fatt qed jiġri.
I know what you were doing	Naf dak li kont qed tagħmel
He made me.	Huwa għamel lili.
I hope it will be soon	Nispera li jkun dalwaqt
No one said anything.	Ħadd ma qal xejn.
Not only that.	Mhux hekk biss.
I wasn’t sure if you could do that	Ma kontx ċert jekk tistax tagħmel dan
I was very happy with that	Kont ferħan ħafna b'dan
I didn’t think anyone was going to know	Ma kont naħseb li xi ħadd kien se jkun jaf
He must come.	Huwa għandu jiġi.
I want to go home too	Irrid immur id-dar ukoll
A few hours early in the evening can be good	Ftit sigħat kmieni filgħaxija jista 'jkun tajjeb
I was as happy as I could be	Kont kuntent kif jista’ jkun
I know you can do that right	Naf li tista’ tagħmel hekk tajjeb
You have to be.	Għandek tkun.
I think.	Naħseb.
I haven't heard anything yet	Għadni ma smajt xejn
There is no telling me.	M'hemm l-ebda tgħidli.
He wanted to go back.	Ried imur lura.
I still can't believe it	Jien għadni ma nistax nemmen
I hope she likes it	Jien nittama li hi tixtieq
I didn’t want the same as that	Jien ma ridtx l-istess bħal dik
I’m going home from now on	Jien sejjer id-dar minn issa
He just goes.	Huwa biss imur.
He doesn't know anything.	Ma jaf ta’ xejn.
It takes a while.	Jieħu ftit ħin.
I didn’t want that	Jien ma ridtx hekk
Please, please no more.	Jekk jogħġbok, jekk jogħġbok mhux aktar.
I was very happy.	Kont kuntent ħafna.
I was trying to have fun.	Kont qed nipprova nagħmel gost.
I know how much.	Naf kemm.
But he didn't.	Imma hu ma.
Not long now.	Mhux twil issa.
I'm waiting.	Nistenna.
I needed to go with him	Kelli bżonn immur miegħu
I couldn’t take it anymore	Ma stajtx nieħu aktar
I really like being alone	Inħobb ħafna li nkun waħdi
You can't go any way.	Ma tistax tmur l-ebda mod.
Something else, too.	Xi ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
Try everything you can.	Ipprova dak kollu li tista’.
I still did.	Għadni għamilt.
But by then it was too late.	Imma sa dak iż-żmien kien tard wisq.
So it is with us.	Hekk hu magħna.
He had to wait until it happened alone.	Kellu jistenna sakemm ġara waħdu.
I fully understand	Nifhem għal kollox
I didn’t even know how	Lanqas kont naf kif
I just need to know	Għandi bżonn biss inkun naf
I like it that way too.	Jien inħobb hekk ukoll.
I’m not sure you know what that is right now.	M'inix ċert li taf x'inhu dak bħalissa.
I wish it was that easy	Nixtieq li kien daqshekk faċli
They were the same things.	Kienu l-istess affarijiet.
And it almost works.	U kważi jaħdem.
There were a lot of people.	Kien hemm ħafna nies.
We have almost everything.	Għandna kważi kollox.
Maybe we need time out.	Forsi għandna bżonn ħin barra.
Nothing is forever.	Xejn mhu għal dejjem.
Many.	Ħafna.
We are not.	Aħna le.
I would have been able to do that	Jien kont inkun kapaċi nagħmel hekk
This is great for that.	Dan huwa kbir għal dak.
I never knew it would happen so quickly	Qatt ma kont naf li jista’ jiġri daqshekk malajr
I already know who this is	Diġà naf min hu dan
But it was.	Imma kien.
After all, I was a good boy	Wara kollox kont tifel tajjeb
It wasn’t very big.	Ma kienx kbir ħafna.
He was not a good boy at all.	Ma kienx tifel tajjeb għal xejn.
I returned a little more	I lura ftit aktar
I wanted and needed help	Ridt u kelli bżonn l-għajnuna
I can’t do anything more than once	Ma nistax nagħmel xi ħaġa aktar minn darba
Certainly not.	Żgur li ma tistax tkun hekk .
I am doing this alone	Qed nagħmel dan waħdi
What happened should not have happened.	Dak li ġara ma kellux jiġri.
We have no money.	M’għandniex flus.
I want to do more than that.	Irrid nagħmel aktar minn hekk.
I had a great time.	Jien kelli ħafna ħin.
That’s not always as easy as it sounds.	Dak mhux dejjem faċli daqs kemm jidher.
Eat well.	Tiekol tajjeb.
I think he just needs time.	Naħseb li għandu bżonn iż-żmien biss.
You want to tell me more.	Trid tgħidli aktar.
I thought it better that way	Ħsibt li aħjar hekk
He had done more.	Kien għamel aktar.
Ask who he is.	Staqsa min hu.
It was usually the first one in.	Normalment kienet l-ewwel waħda fi.
Everyone seemed to be having a good time.	Kulħadd deher li kien qed jieħu ħin tajjeb.
I need you	Għandi bżonn għalik
I saw it all.	Rajt dan kollu.
To each other.	Lil xulxin.
I wanted to be someone	Ridt inkun xi ħadd
And he, died often.	U hu, miet spiss.
Everywhere he looked there were people.	Kull fejn ħares kien hemm nies.
I haven’t been able to say this before	Ma stajtx ngħid dan qabel
I never said anything	Qatt ma għedt xejn
I knew he was back for a long time	Kont naf li mar lura għal żmien twil
But he wants to.	Imma jrid.
I have to think beforehand	Ikolli naħseb qabel
Now it was just work that was there for him.	Issa kien biss xogħol li kien hemm għalih.
I just want you to think about it	Irrid biss li taħseb dwarha
I know you can do that	Naf li tista’ tagħmel dan
I wonder why you came	Nistaqsi għaliex ġejt
I just heard.	Għadni kemm smajt.
I needed to do something.	Kelli bżonn nagħmel xi ħaġa.
I will be back in a year.	Se nkun lura fi żmien sena.
He would be.	Hu jkun.
Not so bad.	Mhuwiex daqshekk ħażin.
I couldn’t talk or anything.	Ma stajtx nitkellem jew xejn.
This book does just that	Dan il-ktieb jagħmel hekk
I hardly knew anyone so well	Jien ma tantx kont naf lil ħadd daqshekk tajjeb
I just said he left with you	Għidt biss li telaq miegħek
Before or now.	Qabel jew issa.
They were now.	Huma kienu issa.
Not for us.	Mhux għalina.
I’m very happy about that.	Jien kuntent ħafna dwar dan.
You can do this well.	Tista 'tagħmel dan tajjeb.
And we need help.	U għandna bżonn l-għajnuna.
I never had.	Qatt ma kelli.
That was the last few years.	Hekk kien l-aħħar ftit snin.
You can't make more time.	Ma tistax tagħmel aktar ħin.
I go there every year.	Immur hemm kull sena.
But this is not happening.	Imma dan mhux qed jiġri.
This is my home.	Din hija d-dar tiegħi.
Time to think.	Ħin biex taħseb.
I just need to wait	Għandi bżonn biss nistenna
That’s a big problem.	Dik hija problema kbira.
I can’t take more than that	Ma nistax nieħu aktar minn dan
It couldn’t have been otherwise.	Ma setax ikun mod ieħor.
I thought it would never happen	Ħsibt li qatt ma jiġri
I need to do this quickly	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan malajr
Nobody knows everything.	Ħadd ma jaf kollox.
Everything was wrong	Kollox kien ħażin
For this very large door.	Għal dan il-bieb kbir ħafna.
I hope he comes back	Nispera li jiġi lura
I often thought about it	Ħafna drabi kont naħseb dwarha
It would not be the same.	Ma jkunx l-istess.
He just says he's not happy with you.	Jgħid biss li mhux kuntent miegħek.
That’s not how it works.	Dak mhux kif jaħdem.
Which we have now.	Li għandna issa.
We know how to do it.	Aħna nafu kif nagħmlu dan.
I used to sit there and take it	Kont noqgħod hemm u nieħu
It didn’t take long.	Ma kellix twil.
I never thought so	Qatt ma kont naħseb
It looks so much better now.	Jidher daqshekk aħjar issa.
I want that.	Irrid dak.
All of the above.	Kollha ta 'qabel.
I don’t know much about it.	Ma tantx naf ħafna dwarha.
The truth is you have to know better.	Il-verità hi li għandek tkun taf aħjar.
Now he wasn't sure.	Issa ma kienx ċert.
And to speak.	U biex titkellem.
I was really busy too	Verament kont okkupat ukoll
I wanted to know what he was thinking	Ridt inkun naf x’qed jaħseb
I’m not surprised by that.	Jien mhux sorpriż b'dan.
But not only that.	Imma mhux hekk biss.
They felt great.	Ħassu ħafna.
I will definitely do this again	Żgur li nagħmel dan mill-ġdid
I knew he was out there	Kont naf li kien hemm barra
That certainly hadn’t gone well.	Li żgur ma kienx mar tajjeb.
I still don't know how.	Għadni ma nafx kif.
I hadn’t thought about that	Ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan
That's an easy one.	Dik hija waħda faċli.
He knew he wanted to say something more.	Kien jaf li jrid jgħid xi ħaġa aktar.
I see you heard from me before	Nara li smajt minni qabel
I did too.	Jien għamilt ukoll.
I know he won't be here tonight	Naf li mhux se jkun hawn illejla
I never knew what he was going to do.	Qatt ma kont taf x’kien se jagħmel.
I would stay for a few hours	I kien joqgħod għal ftit sigħat
You did nothing.	Inti ma għamilt xejn.
But it has to be good.	Imma jrid ikun tajjeb.
I have no friends.	Jien m'għandi l-ebda ħbieb.
I can’t say how anyone could know.	Ma nistax ngħid kif xi ħadd jista' jkun jaf.
Just like before.	Eżatt bħal qabel.
I have to think fast	Ikolli naħseb malajr
I need to stay around the house a bit	Għandi bżonn noqgħod madwar id-dar xi ftit
I would have been like that.	Jien kont inkun hekk.
I could tell what he was thinking	Stajt ngħid dak li kien qed jaħseb
I knew exactly where she was going to be	Kont naf eżatt fejn kienet se tkun
I know it won’t be forever	Naf li mhux se jkun għal dejjem
I haven't been with anyone in a long time	Ilni ma kont ma’ ħadd
And that’s pretty much enough.	U dan huwa pjuttost biżżejjed.
But she had to.	Imma kellha.
Everything would be so easy.	Kollox ikun faċli hekk.
I see that you are not well	Nara li m'intix tajjeb
It was pretty good.	Kien pjuttost tajjeb.
There will be another soon enough.	Se jkun hemm ieħor malajr biżżejjed.
I know people who are already doing this	Naf nies li diġà qed jagħmlu dan
Not surprised to say nothing.	Mhux sorpriż li ma tgħid xejn.
I know you will never know	Naf li qatt mhu se tkun taf
Or maybe we did.	Jew forsi għamilna.
It wasn’t there.	Ma kienx hemm.
It was working.	Kien jaħdem.
I’ve been taking this a lot lately	Dan l-aħħar nieħu ħafna dan
It will not help.	Mhux se jgħin.
Not this.	Mhux dan.
I can’t believe what just happened	Ma nistax nemmen dak li għadu kif ġara
I was wondering who I was	Jien kont nistaqsi li jien
That’s his only chance.	Dak hu l-uniku ċans tiegħu.
I better do that now	Aħjar nagħmel hekk issa
I never do that	Jien qatt ma nagħmel hekk
I didn’t want to go	Ma ridtx li jmur
This was done as follows.	Dan sar kif ġej.
Not really good.	Mhux tassew tajjeb.
I believe it was something else.	Nemmen li kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
He just couldn't take it anymore.	Huwa biss ma setax jieħu aktar.
I didn’t want to.	Jien ma ridtx.
Too long for me.	Wisq twil għalija.
I was worried for nothing.	Jien kont inkwetat għal xejn.
There was nothing else out there like that.	Ma kien hemm xejn ieħor hemmhekk bħal dik.
I knew what was coming next	Kont naf x’kien se jiġi wara
Now you want more and more and more.	Issa trid aktar u aktar u aktar.
It was really, really good.	Kien tassew, tassew tajjeb.
I want to talk to you	Irrid nitkellem miegħek
I hope it’s not too bad for you	Nittama li ma jkunx ħażin wisq għalik
Will you be watching ?.	Se tkun qed tara?.
I just wanted to go home	Għadni ridt biss immur id-dar
Maybe she is.	Forsi hi.
You should know better.	Għandek tkun taf aħjar.
I don’t want to think about it anymore	Ma rridx naħseb aktar dwarha
I'm surprised many do.	Jien sorpriż li ħafna jagħmlu.
In fact, it was better that way.	Fil-fatt, kien aħjar hekk.
It can also be quite difficult.	Jista 'jkun ukoll pjuttost diffiċli.
It was very difficult.	Kien diffiċli ħafna.
I really didn't need that now	I verament ma kellix bżonn li issa
I think it looks a lot better	Naħseb li jidher ħafna aħjar
I’m glad we did what we did.	Jien kuntent li għamilna dak li għamilna.
I don’t quite understand.	Jien ma tantx nifhem.
I didn’t know you were telling the truth	Ma kontx naf li qed tgħid il-verità
Yours the same.	Tiegħek l-istess.
I didn’t have time for that	Ma kellix ħin għal dan
I can do this from here	Jien nista' nagħmel dan minn hawn
I still want everything good.	Għadni rrid kollox tajjeb.
It was afternoon.	Kien wara nofsinhar.
I did nothing wrong	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin
I was sure it was there.	Kont ċert li kien hemm.
No one said it was easy.	Ħadd ma qal li kien faċli.
I hope we can be friends	Nittama li nistgħu nkunu ħbieb
But you were not happy about that.	Imma int ma kontx kuntent b’dan.
You will not go.	Inti mhux se tmur.
He is happy.	Huwa kuntent.
I hope that will be enough today	Jien nittama li jkun biżżejjed illum
I hope it would have been more.	Jien nittama li kien ikun aktar.
I hope to be there tomorrow	Nittama li nkun hemm għada
I tell everyone so, you know	Jien ngħid lil kulħadd hekk, taf
I can't stay long	Ma nistax toqgħod għal żmien twil
There is our way.	Hemm mod tagħna.
Or nothing tomorrow.	Jew għada xejn.
I wonder how long it has been here	Nistaqsi kemm ilu hawn
It was something.	Kienet xi ħaġa.
Just a little tired is everything.	Biss ftit għajjien huwa kollox.
I know he won't do anything about it	Naf li mhu se tagħmel xejn dwarha
It's just always there.	Huwa biss dejjem hemm.
Lots of money	Ħafna flus
Maybe she was right.	Forsi kellha raġun.
You know what you're doing.	Taf x’qed tagħmel.
I want to talk to you a little bit	Irrid nitkellem ftit miegħek
No, it’s not the car.	Le, mhix il-karozza.
No way, it’s not happening.	L-ebda mod, mhux qed jiġri.
Time only says.	Iż-żmien jgħid biss.
This is great.	Dan huwa kbir.
I said if he had.	Għidt jekk kellux.
It was just a little outside.	Kien biss ftit barra.
I never thought about it	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwar dan
But he knew better now.	Imma kien jaf aħjar issa.
No one did anything.	Ħadd ma għamel xi ħaġa.
I think you need to talk to both of you	Naħseb li għandek bżonn titkellem it-tnejn
I wonder where she is	Nistaqsi fejn hi
That's just it.	Hekk hu biss.
It's easier than you think.	Huwa aktar faċli milli taħseb.
I knew why he was here	Kont naf għaliex kien hawn
I can do that	Nista 'nagħmel dan
I had too little	Kelli ftit wisq
More than a little, maybe.	Aktar minn ftit, forsi.
You will be fine.	Int tkun tajjeb.
It takes a lot of time.	Huwa jieħu ħafna ħin.
That's all.	Dak hu biss.
Maybe you are right.	Forsi għandek raġun.
I didn’t enjoy it.	Ma kontx nieħu gost.
We have it is not.	Għandna mhuwiex.
It really works.	Tassew jaħdem.
Today.	Illum.
Everything was really good.	Kollox kien tassew tajjeb.
Not as a whole.	Mhux kollu kemm hu.
I thought I could do something.	Ħsibt li tista’ tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I expect you to say something.	Nistenna li tgħid xi ħaġa.
I know that, too.	Naf li, ukoll.
Each before.	Kull wieħed qabel.
I thought maybe.	Ħsibt forsi.
She knew so much, of course she knew.	Kienet taf daqshekk, ovvjament kienet taf.
I had never thought of it so before.	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwarha hekk qabel.
I try to do my best.	Nipprova nagħmel kemm jista’ jkun.
I think no time seemed like a good time	Naħseb li l-ebda ħin ma deher żmien tajjeb
I'm sure it will help	Jiena ċert li se jgħin
But this is never enough.	Imma dan qatt mhu biżżejjed.
A man wants to.	Raġel irid.
They are things.	Huma affarijiet.
One would suffice.	Wieħed ikun biżżejjed.
Your time will come.	Il-ħin tiegħek se jasal.
Maybe you.	Forsi int.
Every time he wanted to.	Kull darba li ried.
All right with me.	Kollox tajjeb miegħi.
That was not enough.	Dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
No one has agreed to do this yet.	Ħadd ma qabel li jagħmel dan, għadu.
I wish he had more friends	Nixtieq li kellu aktar ħbieb
Anything can happen here.	Hawn jista' jiġri kollox.
I didn't want to talk or listen or think	Ma ridtx nitkellem jew nisma’ jew naħseb
It looks like great fun.	Jidher qisu gost kbir.
I hope you come back	Nispera li tiġi lura
And he seems to have been right.	U jidher li kellu raġun.
He wasn't sure of anything.	Ma kien ċert minn xejn.
I just, you know, didn't know how to do it	Jien biss, taf, ma kontx naf kif ġej
No one died.	Ħadd ma miet.
But at the moment it seems to never work.	Imma bħalissa jidher li qatt ma jaħdem.
I know better than to sit there	Naf aħjar milli noqgħod bilqiegħda hemmhekk
It has just begun for him.	Għadu kemm beda għalih.
It works.	Jaħdem.
Want to see this one !.	Trid tara dan wieħed!.
I know it can be difficult	Naf li jista 'jkun diffiċli
It could be me.	Jista 'jkun jien.
We have to do it now.	Irridu nagħmlu dan issa.
I think so too.	Naħseb hekk ukoll.
This is a good thing and a bad thing.	Din hija ħaġa tajba u ħażina.
And so it was.	U hekk kien.
He is so with you.	Huwa tant miegħek.
I have to believe that.	Ikolli nemmen li.
I thought I was going to say a little more	Ħsibt li kont se tgħid xi ftit aktar
I would always be fine	Inkun dejjem tajjeb
I can say that	Nista 'ngħid daqshekk
I know what he wants	Naf xi jrid
I had already done mine	Kont diġà għamilt tiegħi
It seems like a lot of work.	Jidher li ħafna xogħol.
I needed to be alone	Kelli bżonn inkun waħdi
In fact, there are many more than one.	Fil-fatt, hemm ħafna aktar minn wieħed.
And better there than here with us.	U aħjar hemmhekk milli hawn magħna.
They and you.	Huma u int.
Glad that, actually.	Ferħan li, fil-fatt.
It’s three years ago as you say.	Huwa tliet snin ilu kif tgħid.
I was just surprised now.	Kont sorpriż biss issa.
I had no idea what time it was	Ma kellix idea x'kien il-ħin
I think you make a great teacher	Naħseb li tagħmel għalliem kbir
I didn't know what to do	Ma kontx naf x’kien mar jagħmel
But just sitting around all the time.	Imma biss bilqiegħda madwar il-ħin kollu.
I can only go so far alone	Nista 'biss immur daqshekk twil waħdi
I am doing this now	Qed nagħmel dan issa
I see what we have.	Nara dak li għandna.
I didn’t have to wonder where it was anymore	Ma kellix għalfejn nistaqsi fejn kien aktar
We will not do that.	Aħna mhux se nagħmlu dan.
I have to think.	Irrid taħseb.
There you are right.	Hemm għandek raġun.
I was hoping he was with you	Kont nittama li kien miegħek
It's better than nothing.	Huwa aħjar minn xejn.
I know it’s great.	Naf li huwa kbir.
She could tell.	Hija tista 'tgħid.
I knew she had something to say.	Kont naf li kellha xi tgħid.
He did.	Dan għamel.
Why or why not.	Għaliex jew għaliex le.
But this was not working.	Imma dan ma kienx qed jaħdem.
I think this might work better	Naħseb li dan jista' jaħdem aħjar
I thought a lot for you	Ħsibt ħafna għalik
I want you to know that	Irrid li tkun taf dak
I couldn't see anyone	Ma stajt nara lil ħadd
I didn’t always do well	Mhux dejjem għamilt tajjeb
I needed someone to go with me.	Kelli bżonn xi ħadd li jmur miegħi.
It wasn’t the last time he looked.	Ma kienx hemm l-aħħar darba li ħares.
I can't go now	Ma nistax immur issa
But he would not.	Imma ma kienx se.
I'm his help.	Jien l-għajnuna tiegħu.
I definitely wasn't that good	Żgur li ma kontx daqshekk tajba
Not that he wanted anything to happen.	Mhux li ried li jiġri xi ħaġa.
I wish she was still here	Nixtieq li kienet għadha hawn
When it usually is I'm scared.	Meta normalment huwa jien jibża '.
That’s not who we are.	Dak mhux min aħna.
One man at a time.	Raġel wieħed kull darba.
Not until someone else wants to.	Mhux sakemm xi ħadd ieħor irid.
We have one man.	Għandna raġel wieħed.
I think you will be surprised	Naħseb li tkun sorpriż
I never wanted to need anyone	Qatt ma ridt ikolli bżonn lil ħadd
If we can.	Jekk nistgħu.
I knew he was right	Kont naf li kellu raġun
It was a matter of time.	Kienet problema ta’ żmien.
Is it good ?.	Huwa tajjeb?.
I wasn't even going to say that	Jien lanqas kont se ngħid hekk
It's this.	Huwa dan.
Never, actually.	Qatt, fil-fatt.
There are few.	Ftit hemm.
I’m not worried about that.	Jien mhux inkwetat dwar dan.
I always am.	Jien dejjem jien.
I wish it wasn’t so.	Nixtieq li ma kienx hekk.
You were right about everything.	Kellek raġun dwar kollox.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
More willing than she would ever know, actually.	Aktar lest milli hi qatt tkun taf, fil-fatt.
I want you to take this.	Irrid li tieħu dan.
I could understand what happened after that	Stajt nifhem x’ġara wara dak
I’m just doing my job	Jien biss qed nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi
Everyone is really happy for him.	Kulħadd huwa tassew kuntent għalih.
Never to return.	Li qatt ma jerġa’ lura.
I just need some money	Għandi bżonn biss ftit flus
You know what they're doing.	Taf x’qed jagħmlu.
I have a hard time making friends, you know	Għandi diffiċli biex nagħmel ħbieb, taf
Go for what I thought.	Tmur għal dak li ħsibt.
That will be fine.	Dan se jkun tajjeb.
I knew more than that	Kont naf aktar minn hekk
I will speak the truth here	Jien se nitkellem il-verità hawn
After all I wasn’t a kid yet	Wara kollox ma kontx għadni tifel
In fact, you should.	Fil-fatt, inti għandek.
It often went wrong, very wrong.	Ħafna drabi mar ħażin, ħażin ħafna.
I have some time to be with you	Għandi ftit ħin biex inkun miegħek
No one was around.	Ħadd ma kien madwar.
Everything works fine.	Dak kollu jaħdem tajjeb.
I just wanted to stay out	Ridt biss noqgħod barra
He could not and could not be anything else.	Huwa jista 'ma u ma setax ikun xi ħaġa oħra.
I once had a friend like that	Darba kelli ħabib hekk
I hear everything.	Nisma kollox.
I’ve been talking about it for years.	Ilni snin nitkellem dwarha.
That can never happen.	Dak qatt ma jista’ jiġri.
He will not tell anyone.	Mhu se jgħid lil ħadd.
It was not easy.	Ma kinitx xi ħaġa faċli.
I know what he's going to do	Naf x’se jagħmel
Maybe, too.	Forsi, wisq.
I have no idea where it came from.	M'għandi l-ebda idea minn fejn ġie.
In fact I would	Fil-fatt nixtieq
There must be a better way to do this.	Għandu jkun hemm mod aħjar kif tagħmel dan.
I didn’t know anything.	Jien ma kont naf xejn.
Too late.	Tard wisq.
Now it was too late.	Issa kien tard wisq.
And they do.	U dan jagħmlu.
I want to know why he left	Irrid inkun naf għaliex telaq
So it was.	Hekk kienet.
You would be right.	Int tkun raġun.
I couldn't understand why	Ma stajtx nifhem għaliex
I'm going there now	Jien issa sejjer hemm
I was too young to know how at the time.	Kont żgħir wisq biex naf kif dak iż-żmien.
That's all.	Dak hu kollu.
I didn’t even have time to think	Lanqas kelli ħin naħseb
I always knew when I was you	Dejjem kont naf meta kont int
I didn’t know that, quite	Jien ma kontx naf dan, pjuttost
And nothing too early for that.	U xejn kmieni wisq għal dan.
It's easy.	Huwa faċli.
And every time, she would tell me otherwise.	U kull darba, kienet tgħidli mod ieħor.
But he did more than that.	Imma għamel aktar minn dan.
My house was good.	Id-dar tiegħi kienet tajba.
And that would be easy enough.	U dan ikun faċli biżżejjed.
He didn't even ask.	Lanqas biss staqsa.
I know you can and you want to	Naf li tista’ u trid jekk trid
I’m not even sure they are	Jien lanqas ċert li huma
I couldn’t believe it was my first	Ma stajtx nemmen li kien l-ewwel tiegħi
I have no idea what he's doing there	M’għandi l-ebda idea x’qed jagħmel hemmhekk
And, well.	U, ukoll.
Tomorrow there will be good eating.	Għada jkun hemm tiekol tajjeb.
I really wanted to too	Verament ridt ukoll
I don't have to.	M'għandix.
I try to think of something else	Nipprova naħseb dwar xi ħaġa oħra
She knew.	Kienet taf.
Everyone knows that by now.	Kulħadd jaf dak sa issa.
Everything is ready.	Kollox ikun lest.
I never wanted to be with him.	Qatt ma ridt inkun miegħu.
I think more.	Naħseb aktar.
I never thought it would look like it	Qatt ma kont ħsibt kif kienet tidher
He knew how good he was.	Kien jaf kemm kien tajjeb.
You never want to say, you know, that this is it.	Qatt ma trid tgħid, taf, li dan hu.
I still hadn’t even thought about it	Għadni lanqas biss kont ħsibt dwarha
I have a lot of money	Għandi ħafna flus
I will not be too far behind	Mhux se nkun wisq lura
I was hoping for more	Kont nittama għal aktar
Not everyone wants to do that.	Mhux kulħadd irid jagħmel hekk.
I was really alone now	Jien kont tassew waħdi issa
Which, it is.	Li, huwa.
Nothing more than that, really.	Xejn aktar minn hekk, tassew.
Worth a try.	Ta’ min jipprova.
Work.	Xogħol.
But it was.	Imma kien minn hekk.
I really wanted to be	Verament ridt inkun
I can tell you what it was.	Nista 'ngħidlek dak li kien.
I knew it was coming	Kont naf li kien ġej
I'm not already there	Jien m'iniex diġà hemm
It would have been great.	Kieku kien kbir.
In fact, he had never done that.	Fil-fatt, qatt ma kien għamel dan.
I don’t know who did this.	Ma nafx min għamel dan.
It will be good.	Se jkun tajjeb.
No, no, not so.	Le, le, mhux hekk.
I don't want to be you	Ma rridx li wieħed ikun int
I just need to know that everything	Għandi bżonn biss inkun naf li kollox
And ours no.	U tagħna le.
No one knew.	Ħadd ma kien ikun jaf.
You are me.	Int jien.
I didn’t have to think about it	Ma kellix għalfejn naħseb dwar dan
I had none of them	Ma kelli wieħed minn xejn
I will do this tonight	Jien se nagħmel dan illejla
I want to see who he is	Irrid nara min hu
This certainly never happened.	Dan żgur qatt ma ġara.
I don't think you can do that.	Ma naħsibx li tista’ tagħmel hekk.
I was actually happy	Fil-fatt kont kuntent
Nobody wants anything.	Ħadd ma jrid xejn.
I knew what he was trying to say	Kont naf x’kien qed jipprova jgħid
This is a good boy.	Dan huwa tifel tajjeb.
I didn’t want to go back	Ma ridtx lura
I had to be ready too	Kelli nkun lest ukoll
I'm going to need some money	Jien ser ikolli bżonn xi flus
It's almost ready.	Huwa kważi lest.
I thought it might be a good time now	Ħsibt li issa jista’ jkun żmien tajjeb
I hope he is.	Nispera li hu.
It went very well.	Huwa mar tajjeb ħafna.
For some time he saw no one.	Għal xi żmien ma ra lil ħadd.
He seemed to be having fun.	Deher li kien qed jieħu gost.
I didn't have to say that	Jien ma kellix ngħid hekk
Again, please.	Darba oħra, jekk jogħġbok.
I need you to be with me	Għandi bżonn li tkun hemm miegħi
But some people would.	Imma xi nies kieku.
I had to be quick about it	I kellha tkun malajr dwar dan
I thought of you all the time	Ħsibt għalik il-ħin kollu
Maybe it would.	Forsi kieku.
I am very sorry for him.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għalih.
I know this house is telling me something	Naf li din id-dar qed tgħidli xi ħaġa
Great in fact.	Kbir fil-fatt.
I do both.	Jien nagħmel it-tnejn.
I never wanted anything like this to happen	Qatt ma ridt li jiġri xi ħaġa minn dan
I had a husband at the time.	Dak iż-żmien kelli raġel.
He can't speak.	Ma jistax jitkellem.
I’m not telling anyone.	Jien ma ngħid lil ħadd.
I wasn't going to now	Jien ma kontx se issa
You really aren't very good.	Int verament m'intix tajjeb ħafna.
I can't do this again	Ma nistax nagħmel dan mill-ġdid
And maybe.	U forsi.
I definitely didn’t tell anyone	Żgur li ma għedt lil ħadd
Much, much better.	Ħafna, ħafna aħjar.
I’m sure there’s more.	Jiena ċert li hemm aktar.
He had done it.	Huwa kien għamel dan.
He looked my way.	Huwa ħares lejn mod tiegħi.
I never want to do that again	Qatt ma rrid nagħmel hekk mill-ġdid
It can only happen.	Jista' jiġri biss.
I'm still here.	Għadni hawn.
I haven’t done any of that in a long time	Ilni ma għamilt xejn minn hekk
I think he could try.	Naħseb li seta' jipprova.
I was a little surprised	Kont ftit sorpriż
It can be bad too.	Jista 'jkun ħażin ukoll.
She.	Hija.
I really don’t think much about it anymore	Verament ma naħsibx ħafna dwarha aktar
But you know better.	Imma taf aħjar.
I could do more	Stajt nagħmel aktar
I would never have been able to do it myself.	Qatt ma kont inkun kapaċi nagħmel jien.
Maybe they really felt bad about what happened.	Forsi tassew ħassu ħażin dwar dak li ġara.
And that was when it happened.	U dak kien meta ġara.
Good but not great.	Tajjeb imma mhux kbir.
To be happy now.	Biex tkun kuntent issa.
I think for too little	Naħseb għal ftit wisq
Not hard enough.	Mhux diffiċli biżżejjed.
On everything she did.	Fuq dak kollu li għamlet.
I really wanted to but I couldn't	Verament ridt imma ma stajtx
I can tell he works out	Nista 'ngħid li jaħdem barra
Or for you.	Jew għalik.
Le le le le.	Le le le le.
It would be for me.	Ikun għalija.
I’m worried I’ll do a good job.	Jien inkwetat li nagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
I can’t do that for you.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan għalik.
I know for sure.	Naf li żgur.
I have never heard of it before.	Qatt ma smajt hekk qabel.
I'm alone but that's fine	Jien waħdi imma dan hu tajjeb
Today we were back at school.	Illum konna lura l-iskola.
But it wasn’t there.	Imma ma kienx hemm.
I never ask anyone	Qatt ma nistaqsi lil ħadd
I think that was where it came from	Naħseb li kien minn fejn ġie
Be fi.	Fi fi.
I can't do anything right here	Ma nista' nagħmel xejn tajjeb hawn
But it was he who arrived late.	Imma kien hu li wasal tard.
He didn't look happy.	Ma deherx kuntent.
To be yours.	Li tkun tiegħek.
It was a beautiful thing to say.	Kienet ħaġa sabiħa li tgħid.
It really looks bad.	Huwa verament jidher ħażin.
I thought you knew that	Ħsibt li taf li
No one has ever told me so before.	Ħadd qatt ma qalli hekk qabel.
My time passed.	Il-ħin tiegħi għadda.
I’ve done everything before	Għamilt kollox qabel
Everyone knows everyone here.	Kulħadd jaf lil kulħadd hawn.
I just want to be a good person	Irrid li jkun biss persuna tajba
Can't you ?.	Ma tistax int?.
I couldn't think of anything to say	Ma stajt naħseb xejn xi ngħid
I'm here and with you	Jien hawn u miegħek
I had to see a little better	Kelli nara ftit aħjar
So is a person.	Hekk hija persuna.
I can see you like that	Nista' nara li inti bħal dik
I think my friend is right	Naħseb li ħabib tiegħi għandu raġun
I'll try otherwise	Jien ser nipprova mod ieħor
We both were.	It-tnejn li aħna konna.
How does this work?	Kif jaħdem dan.
I will do well	Jien se nagħmel tajjeb
I'll think of something.	Jien ser naħseb xi ħaġa.
After you think, do.	Wara li taħseb, tagħmel.
He just doesn't want to do that.	Huwa biss ma jridx jagħmel dan.
I've seen it before	Rajt qabel
We will do something about it.	Se nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwarha.
I thought a lot about it	Ħsibt ħafna dwarha
Now he was here.	Issa kien hawn.
It's been a few hours	Ilni ftit sigħat
We are doing so now.	Hekk qed nagħmlu issa.
This is so very bad.	Dan huwa tant ħażin ħafna.
I was more than anyone.	Jien kont aktar minn ħadd.
I want to know what happened and why	Irrid inkun naf x'ġara u għaliex
I wasn’t ready for what happened next	Ma kontx lest għal dak li ġara wara
It's for you.	Huwa għalik.
And the time has come.	U wasal iż-żmien.
He was not here.	Hu ma kienx hawn.
There is always something else you want.	Dejjem hemm xi ħaġa oħra li trid.
Obviously have a good time.	Ovvjament għandhom ħin tajjeb.
I knew you.	Kont naf li inti.
I was a little worried myself	Jien kont xi ftit inkwetat jien
If you want.	Jekk trid.
Alone.	Waħdu.
Tired a few other times	Għajjien xi ftit drabi oħra
Everyone wants to do that.	Kulħadd irid jagħmel dan.
I need someone.	Għandi bżonn xi ħadd.
He does none of these things.	Hu ma jagħmel xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet.
Maybe someone did.	Forsi xi ħadd għamel.
Where did this come from.	Minn fejn ġie dan.
That’s the only way it works.	Dak hu l-uniku mod kif jaħdem.
Usually, most people do.	Normalment, ħafna nies jagħmlu.
I'm not saying anything like that	Jien ma ngħid hekk xejn
I have a lot of what we need out there	Għandi ħafna minn dak li għandna bżonn hemmhekk
It doesn't matter how fast you go.	Jista’ jkun xejn għalija kemm tmur malajr.
She had to eat more.	Kellha tiekol aktar.
I have another year	Għandi sena oħra
You can do whatever you want.	Inti tista 'tagħmel dak kollu li trid.
It was bad.	Kien ħażin.
I have for a long time	Għandi għal żmien twil
With a little bit of.	Bi ftit ta.
I wonder what you will think of this	Nistaqsi x'se taħseb dwar dan
We can do better.	Nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar.
But maybe it wasn’t always like that.	Imma forsi mhux dejjem kien hekk.
Definitely a must have.	Żgur li għandu jkollu.
And there I am.	U hemm jien.
I wish we knew where he was	Nixtieq li nkunu nafu fejn kien
I'm for him.	Jien għalih.
I love one of these	Inħobb waħda minn dawn
I know how to do that	Naf kif nagħmel dan
He had tried that.	Huwa kien ipprova li.
I see you have a problem	Nara li għandek problema
I thought it was a good thing.	Ħsibt li kienet ħaġa tajba.
I wish none of this would happen	Nixtieq li ma jiġri xejn minn dan
I think you can't talk	Naħseb li ma tistax titkellem
I think a lot of people.	Naħseb li ħafna nies.
He needed time to think.	Huwa kellu bżonn iż-żmien biex jaħseb.
I want to understand	Irrid nifhem
No one wants to go there anymore.	Ħadd ma jrid imur hemm aktar.
I had no idea what he was thinking	Ma kellix idea x’kien qed jaħseb
But some people do.	Imma xi nies jagħmlu.
I didn’t really think about it	Ma tantx ħsibt dwarha
I would like to talk more about this.	Nixtieq li titkellem aktar dwar dan.
I know this was difficult	Naf li dan kien diffiċli
I live there.	Jien noqgħod hemm.
She had done nothing wrong.	Hija kienet għamlet xejn ħażin.
I think it will be good	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb
I can't be here all the time	Ma nistax inkun hawn il-ħin kollu
I’m glad there will be another.	Jien ferħan li se jkun hemm ieħor.
This is wrong.	Dan huwa ħażin.
I couldn’t see this anymore	Ma stajtx nara dan aktar
You are like that.	Inti bħal dik.
I was expecting it to look bad	Kont qed nistenna li jidher ħażin
I wasn't doing anything wrong	Ma kont qed nagħmel xejn ħażin
We never had any problems.	Qatt ma kellna xi problemi.
I just wanted to see	Ridt biss nara
I can't do any other.	Ma nista nagħmel l-ebda ieħor.
It all started to happen.	Kulħadd beda jiġri.
No one is here, either.	Ħadd mhu hawn, lanqas.
I hadn't even been here	Lanqas ma kelli ġejt hawn
I think they are too.	Naħseb li huma wisq.
There may be people.	Jista’ jkun hemm nies.
.	.
I just thought it would always be there	Ħsibt biss li dejjem se jkun hemm
This was not the case, there was nothing he needed here.	Dan ma kienx hekk, ma kien hemm xejn li kellu bżonn hawn.
She was eating almost nothing.	Kienet tiekol kważi xejn.
This would not be so bad.	Dan ma jkunx daqshekk ħażin.
But we did.	Imma għamilna.
I had nothing.	Jien ma kelli xejn.
I never thought it would be so great.	Qatt ma ħsibt li kien daqshekk kbir.
But do it.	Imma tagħmel dan.
I was too scared to do that	Kont nibża’ wisq biex nagħmel dan
I was never there	Jien qatt ma kont hemm
One way to do this is as follows.	Mod wieħed biex tagħmel dan huwa kif ġej.
He was not happy.	Ma kienx kuntent.
I did a good job here.	Għamilt xogħol tajjeb hawn.
I will say something.	Jien ngħid xi ħaġa.
He may have passed out.	Huwa jista 'jkun għadda barra.
You don’t have to do that.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel dan.
I knew nothing more than I did.	Jien ma kont naf xejn aktar milli kont.
I have seen this a lot	Rajt dan ħafna
But there was something about it.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa dwarha.
I thought I wanted that from me.	Ħsibt li ridt dak minni.
I will think about what you want	Se naħseb fuq dak li tixtieq
I wish it was, but it’s not	Nixtieq li kien, imma mhux
I will definitely go back	Żgur li nerġa’ mmur lura
I never had any problems with it.	Jien qatt ma kelli problemi miegħu.
That's another.	Dik hija oħra.
Well, we were.	Ukoll, konna.
I hope all is well	Nispera li kollox tajjeb
I wanted to do it on my own	Jien ridt nagħmel dan waħdi
Nothing is better than nothing.	Xejn huwa aħjar minn xejn.
Here's one here.	Hawn wieħed hawn.
I didn’t think there would be	Ma kontx naħseb li jkun hemm
I was surprised too.	Jien kont sorpriż ukoll.
Bad bad bad bad.	Ħażin ħażin ħażin.
We want to be here.	Irridu nkunu hawn.
I was scared of what he was doing	Kont nibża’ minn dak li kien jagħmel
I really didn’t know what to expect.	Verament ma kontx naf x'se nistenna.
I had to wait for that	I kellha nistenna li
Nothing had happened yet.	Għadu ma kien ġara xejn.
I would like to be here with you right now.	Nixtieq li tkun hawn miegħek bħalissa.
I did what you wanted me to do.	Jien għamilt dak li ridt int.
There is no time for that now.	M'hemm l-ebda ħin għal dak issa.
I need to do this now	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan issa
I take something from everything, good or bad.	Nieħu xi ħaġa minn kollox, tajjeb jew ħażin.
He knows nothing.	Ma jaf xejn.
Can you tell me something?	Jista’ wieħed ikun jaf xi ħaġa?.
It's hard right now.	Huwa diffiċli bħalissa.
This is for something that is taking too long.	Dan għal xi ħaġa li qed tieħu wisq żmien.
I didn’t want to think about it	Ma ridtx naħseb dwarha
It should be in the morning.	Għandu jkun filgħodu.
I often thought this was it	Ħafna drabi ħsibt li dan kien
That never really happens	Li qatt ma jiġri verament
Try a little.	Ipprova ftit.
Time has just passed.	Iż-żmien għadu kif għadda.
But that was good enough.	Imma dan kien tajjeb biżżejjed.
I believe that someday we will be friends	Nemmen li xi darba se nkunu ħbieb
He wouldn’t have been surprised if she had.	Ma kienx ikun sorpriż li kieku kellha.
For me it’s everything.	Għalija huwa kollox.
I’m too young to do that.	Jien żgħir wisq biex nagħmel dan.
Please more, more.	Jekk jogħġbok aktar, aktar.
That was what was going to happen.	Hekk kien se jiġri.
And why? 	U għaliex?
I want to go tomorrow.	Irrid immur għada.
I hope so, but it wasn’t	Jien nittama li jkun hekk, imma ma kienx
That's what he does.	Huwa dak li jagħmel.
That he could do.	Li seta’ jagħmel.
I had to say no	I kellha tgħid le
I will definitely do it again	Żgur li se nerġa' nagħmel
I’m happy for him.	Jien kuntent għalih.
THE LAST	L-AĦĦAR
I would like to do that.	Nixtieq li jagħmlu dan.
It’s going to get really, really big.	Ser isir verament verament kbir.
I don’t think there is anyone else here.	Ma naħsibx li hemm ħadd ieħor hawn.
It was just the door.	Kien biss il-bieb.
He is very tired.	Huwa għajjien ħafna.
It’s too early, he thought.	Għadu kmieni wisq, ħaseb.
Now she had to come home.	Issa kellha tiġi d-dar.
He knew it too.	Kien jaf ukoll.
Nothing seems to work.	Xejn jidher li jaħdem.
Maybe so it should be.	Forsi hekk għandu jkun.
It wasn’t there.	Ma kienx hemm.
Come as you are.	Ejja kif int.
But that has to wait.	Imma dak ikollu jistenna.
And sure enough.	U żgur biżżejjed.
I have been eating.	Ilni niekol.
But he went a lot.	Imma mar ħafna.
We want to.	Irridu.
Never tell me anything.	Qatt ma tgħidli xejn.
She knows what she's doing.	Hija taf x'qed tagħmel.
I didn’t want to be there.	Ma ridtx li tkun hemm.
I think we did.	Naħseb li għamilna.
If you think this might be your thing, it probably is.	Jekk taħseb li dan jista 'jkun ħaġa tiegħek, probabbilment huwa.
I’ll be back in a little bit.	Ser inkun lura fi ftit ftit.
Here it was.	Hawn kien.
The truth is what it is.	Il-verità hi dik li hi.
That's what they're supposed to do.	Dak hu li suppost jagħmlu.
I like it so much better.	Jien inħobb hekk ħafna aħjar.
And something good and something bad.	U xi ħaġa tajba u xi ħaġa ħażina.
They are too early.	Huma kmieni wisq.
I can see that.	Nista’ nara nagħmlu dan.
Someone other than me.	Xi ħadd li mhux jien.
There was another way.	Kien hemm mod ieħor.
It was easy too.	Kien faċli wisq.
That was all she had to do.	Dan kien dak li kellha tagħmel.
That's what he could do.	Dan hu li seta’ jagħmel.
I was too glad to go.	Kont ferħan wisq li mmur.
This was done without any problems.	Dan sar mingħajr problemi.
Nothing like that.	Xejn bħal dan.
But he knew he was there.	Imma kien jaf li kien hemm.
All the time.	Il-ħin kollu.
This was the first.	Din kienet l-ewwel.
This he will have to do.	Dan ikollu jagħmel.
You are not good enough.	M'intix tajjeb biżżejjed.
I never had any problems.	Qatt ma kelli xi problemi.
But it won’t be long now.	Imma mhux se jkun twil issa.
No to that, too.	Le għal dak, ukoll.
I don’t even have to think about it.	Lanqas ikolli għalfejn naħseb dwarha.
One is more than anything.	Wieħed huwa aktar minn xejn.
What are you doing tonight?	X'qed tagħmel illejla?
You can see anything you like.	Tista 'tara xi ħaġa li tixtieq.
I do so.	Jien nagħmel hekk.
Only a man.	Raġel biss.
I wish it could be me	Nixtieq li jista 'jkun jien
He does well and looks happy.	Jagħmel tajjeb u jidher kuntent.
This he will have to do.	Dan ikollu jagħmel.
I don't want to talk about it with anyone.	Ma rrid nitkellem dwarha ma’ ħadd.
A boy who went to school with me	Tifel li mar l-iskola miegħi
I can’t believe he came to this	Ma nistax nemmen li wasal għal dan
It's just not you.	Huwa biss mhux int.
I doubt it very much.	Niddubita ħafna.
It can't happen.	Ma jistax jiġri.
I didn’t want to do anything big about it	Ma ridtx nagħmel xi ħaġa kbira dwarha
I think we’ve done this before.	Naħseb li għamilna dan qabel.
If.	Kieku.
They were there forever.	Kienu hemm għal dejjem.
I thought we should go	Ħsibt li għandna mmorru
I was wondering how it was going	Kont qed nistaqsi kif sejjer
He may be here to help.	Jista’ jkun ġej hawn biex jgħin.
She needed that.	Hija kellha bżonn dak.
And very worried.	U inkwetat ħafna.
It also appeared.	Deher ukoll.
They seem to really have something.	Jidher li verament għandhom xi ħaġa.
She is beautiful.	Hija sabiħa.
And they are many.	U huma ħafna.
This is not me.	Dan mhux jien.
Nothing is better.	Xejn mhu aħjar.
Look back at the house.	Ħares lura lejn id-dar.
But not much help.	Imma mhux ħafna għajnuna.
Ask him out well if he is no longer absorbed in the connection.	Staqsa x’għandu jgħid, x’għandu jagħmel.
The things they do.	L-affarijiet li jagħmlu.
I didn’t think so.	Ma kontx ħsibt dan.
There he appears to be a man.	Hemmhekk jidher li hu raġel.
So have they all.	Hekk għandhom kollha kemm huma.
No one was as small as he was.	Ħadd ma kien żgħir daqs kemm kien.
It won't be long.	Mhux se jkun twil.
Not so much but enough.	Mhux daqshekk imma biżżejjed.
There is nothing there to speak for me.	M'hemm xejn hemmhekk biex jitkellem għalija.
He didn’t have to do that.	Ma kellux għalfejn jagħmel hekk.
But you know what.	Imma taf x'inhu.
That was what it was.	Dan kien dak li kien.
But hold back when it appears.	Imma toqgħod lura meta jidher.
He looks like a boy.	Jidher qisu tifel.
.	.
Not for you.	Mhux għalik.
This was the first time together.	Din kienet l-ewwel darba flimkien.
To be able to do this.	Biex tkun kapaċi għal dan.
Maybe he and she.	Forsi hu u hi.
She was good enough now.	Hija kienet tajjeb biżżejjed issa.
He sure can.	Huwa żgur li jista '.
Well, maybe you can.	Ukoll, forsi tista '.
For a young child, it definitely took a lot of time.	Għal tifel żgħir, żgur ħa ħafna ħin.
It wasn’t that hard.	Ma kienx daqshekk diffiċli.
Don't be here.	M'għandekx tkun hawn.
It seemed more here than it seems.	Deher li hawn aktar milli jidher.
He wanted good of course.	Huwa ried tajjeb ovvjament.
I need more time.	Għandi bżonn aktar ħin.
He had been sitting at work at home one evening.	Kien ilu bilqiegħda jaħdem id-dar waħda filgħaxija.
Like.	Bħal.
He wants to talk.	Irid jitkellem.
Only once.	Darba waħda biss.
I don't see anything.	Jien ma nara xejn.
But now, here it is.	Imma issa, hawn kien.
He said it was good.	Qal li kien tajjeb.
You know a lot from what happened here.	Taf ħafna minn dak li ġara hawn.
Anyone can do anything.	Kulħadd jista' jagħmel xi ħaġa.
And a lot will happen.	U se jiġri ħafna.
But that’s about it.	Imma dak hu dwar dan.
I wanted you to know so.	Jien ridt li tkun taf hekk.
I think it’s a good idea.	Naħseb li hija idea tajba.
Most people are like that.	Ħafna nies huma hekk.
Not to a child.	Mhux lil tifel.
You have to do.	Trid tagħmel.
Either that or he knows nothing.	Jew hekk jew ma jaf xejn.
It's not too long.	Mhuwiex twil wisq.
I have to.	Ikolli.
There is something else.	Hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
We knew it was coming, for a while now.	Konna nafu li kien ġej, għal xi żmien issa.
It works well.	Jaħdem tajjeb.
I can do that.	Nista' nagħmel dan.
I'm not sure you will.	M'inix ċert li inti se.
Good to know.	Tajjeb li tkun taf.
I knew what it looked like.	Kont naf kif kien jidher.
More than anyone.	Aktar minn ħadd.
No, it's not beautiful.	Le, mhix sabiħa.
He never has time for me.	Qatt ma għandu ħin għalija.
I don’t even need help.	Lanqas għandi bżonn l-għajnuna.
I thought it was so.	Ħsibt li kien hekk.
I hope you know that.	Nistenna li taf li.
Someone has to do it.	Xi ħadd irid jagħmel dan.
Yours.	Tiegħek.
I have been thinking everything.	Ilni naħseb kollox.
I can’t do things.	Ma nistax nagħmel l-affarijiet.
I think there is something wrong with it.	Naħseb li hemm xi ħaġa ħażina miegħu.
Another and another.	Ieħor u ieħor.
And maybe better.	U forsi aħjar.
It was really very easy.	Kien tassew faċli ħafna.
I know I did.	Naf li għamilt.
It is so.	Hija hekk.
Maybe it's here.	Forsi huwa hawn.
The only thing you have that is just yours.	L-unika ħaġa li għandek li hija biss tiegħek.
He had to be sure about it.	Kellu jkun ċert dwar dan.
I didn’t even know where he lived.	Lanqas kont naf fejn jgħix.
But this is not enough.	Imma dan mhux biżżejjed.
I am very sorry about that.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna dwar dan.
We both know.	It-tnejn nafu.
Well, they are.	Ukoll, huma.
There goes wrong.	Hemmhekk tmur ħażin.
This is happening.	Dan qed jiġri.
That should have been hours ago.	Dak kellu jkun sigħat ilu.
They don't.	Huma ma.
But apparently they do.	Imma milli jidher jagħmlu.
That’s a good thing and a bad thing.	Dik hija ħaġa tajba u ħaġa ħażina.
Well, as soon as you can, please.	Ukoll, hekk kif tista ', jekk jogħġbok.
It won’t be the first time, either.	Mhux se tkun l-ewwel darba, lanqas.
It doesn’t even look like anyone lives here.	Lanqas qisu hawn xi ħadd jgħix.
But that’s not the problem.	Imma dik mhix il-problema.
Not so much, not so fast.	Mhux daqshekk, mhux daqshekk malajr.
That's a good thing.	Dik hija ħaġa tajba.
And this is obviously not good.	U dan ovvjament mhux tajjeb.
I can be everything you need.	Jien nista' nkun dak kollu li għandek bżonn.
Whatever happened, it happened.	Ġara x’ġara, ġara.
Much of this was good.	Ħafna minn dan kien tajjeb.
I try to understand if this is enough.	Nipprova nifhem jekk dan hux biżżejjed.
It’s the same idea.	Hija l-istess idea.
I just came.	Għadni kemm ġejt.
Often not.	Ħafna drabi ma.
I couldn’t believe it.	Jien ma stajtx nemmen.
I am very sorry that this happened.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna li ġara dan.
And this was not so small.	U dan ma kienx daqshekk żgħir.
I knew this had to go.	Kont naf li dan kellu jmur.
I was never like that.	Qatt ma kont hekk.
And everything else that happened will be for nothing.	U kull ħaġa oħra li ġara se tkun għal xejn.
I still want one of these so here it goes.	Għadni rrid wieħed minn dawn hekk hawn tmur.
Now you are thinking that over.	Issa inti taħseb li fuq.
Just so easy.	Biss daqshekk faċli.
No, it doesn't just happen to me.	Le, mhux biss jiġri lili.
We did.	Għamilna.
It's the same thing.	Hija l-istess ħaġa.
He was just one man.	Kien raġel wieħed biss.
It couldn't have been.	Ma setax kien.
It's too much yet.	Huwa wisq għadu.
Or rather, she did.	Jew aħjar, hija għamlet.
That’s what I think, but not sure.	Dak naħseb, imma mhux ċert.
But not all the time.	Imma mhux il-ħin kollu.
I thought wrong.	Ħsibt ħażin.
Too often, it doesn’t.	Spiss wisq, ma jagħmilx hekk.
Not so much anymore.	Mhux hekk aktar.
Maybe you should have.	Forsi suppost kellha.
Sure she had, but now she wasn't so sure.	Żgur li kellha, imma issa ma kienx daqshekk ċert.
What I did.	Dak li għamilt.
You and I were the same.	Jien u int konna l-istess.
I know you are surprised.	Naf li inti sorpriż.
Yours and mine.	Tiegħek u tiegħi.
I say this.	Jien ngħid dan.
I doubt if it will ever happen now.	Niddubita jekk qatt jiġri issa.
And that she did.	U li hi għamlet.
Well, that was something.	Ukoll, dik kienet xi ħaġa.
Definitely try this.	Żgur li ipprova dan.
To know how and to know what.	Li tkun taf kif u tkun taf dak.
I'm sure I will.	Jien żgur li nagħmel.
We know a lot more now.	Nafu ħafna aktar issa.
No one told me so.	Ħadd ma qalli hekk.
Everything will be fine.	Kollox se jkun tajjeb.
No more than he is.	Mhux aktar minn hu.
Not by anyone.	Mhux minn ħadd.
Maybe they were.	Forsi kienu.
I’m a great man.	Jien raġel kbir.
In fact more than that.	Fil-fatt aktar minn hekk.
Nothing.	Xejn.
This should work much better than this.	Dan għandu jaħdem ħafna aħjar minn dan.
Look how he had died.	Ħares kif kien miet.
That is saying something.	Li qed tgħid xi ħaġa.
No one saw anything.	Ħadd ma ra xejn.
Now or never.	Issa jew qatt.
I’m not having a good time with this.	Mhux qed nagħmel ħin tajjeb b'dan.
There was nothing said about it.	Ma kien hemm xejn qal dwar dan.
Nor did it happen.	Lanqas ġara.
This is not very difficult.	Dan mhux diffiċli ħafna.
For a year.	Għal sena.
He was a very good friend of mine.	Huwa kien ħabib tajjeb ħafna tiegħi.
No, that would have been yesterday.	Le, dak kien ikun il-bieraħ.
Maybe, never.	Forsi, mhux qatt.
I'm very happy now.	Jien kuntent ħafna minn issa.
He had said too much.	Huwa kien qal wisq.
I never get enough.	Qatt ma nieħu biżżejjed.
We only need one.	Għandna bżonn wieħed biss.
He couldn't say more.	Ma setax jgħid aktar.
Only one will remain.	Wieħed biss se jibqa’.
I would.	Inkun .
Everyone was late.	Kulħadd kien tard.
I'm so fast.	Jien hekk malajr.
It had been more than three hours.	Huwa kien ilu aktar minn tliet sigħat.
He is ready.	Huwa lest.
Someone there can help.	Xi ħadd hemm jista 'jgħin.
It wasn't like that with other people.	Ma kinitx hekk ma’ nies oħra.
I never do that.	Jien qatt ma nagħmel dan.
But he would not have been able to do it alone.	Imma ma kienx ikun kapaċi jagħmel dan waħdu.
I didn’t want a man.	Ma ridtx raġel.
I can’t think of who would look good on this.	Ma nistax naħseb fuq min ikun jidher tajjeb dan.
Or maybe he can.	Jew forsi jista’.
Look at me.	Ħares għalija.
No one comes here unless they want something.	Ħadd ma jiġi hawn sakemm ma jridx xi ħaġa.
Please come quickly.	Jekk jogħġbok ejja malajr.
Everything is working again.	Kollox qed jaħdem mill-ġdid.
He didn't want to see her come back.	Ma riedx jara li jerġa’ jiġi.
But that was about it.	Imma dak kien dwar dan.
He didn’t even ask about it tonight.	Lanqas biss staqsa dwar dan illejla.
In fact it was.	Fil-fatt kien.
I had thought, of course, many times.	Jien kont ħsibt, ovvjament, ħafna drabi.
No one seemed to be home.	Ħadd ma deher li kien id-dar.
It’s good, really.	Huwa tajjeb, tassew.
It was too big.	Kien kbir wisq.
You are not a bad man.	M'intix raġel ħażin.
Everyone knows what happened.	Kulħadd jaf x’ġara.
About what happened.	Dwar dak li ġara.
I was doing very well.	Kont sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
There is no way to know.	M'hemm l-ebda mod biex tkun taf.
That’s what you want to know.	Dak hu li trid tkun taf.
No, it's not the same.	Le, mhuwiex l-istess.
So we know.	Hekk nafu.
Whatever.	Tkun xi tkun.
But maybe you can do more.	Imma forsi tista’ tagħmel aktar.
He never had any problems.	Qatt ma kellu xi problemi.
Your truth will not seem like mine.	Il-verità tiegħek mhux se tidher bħal tiegħi.
I never thought about it.	Jien qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan.
From here, please.	Minn hawn, jekk jogħġbok.
You can't do that to me.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan lili.
I didn’t know better.	Ma kontx naf aħjar.
Not just friends.	Mhux ħbieb biss.
That too was exactly what he wanted.	Dan ukoll kien eżatt kif ried hu.
This will work.	Dan se jaħdem.
Do nothing.	Ma tagħmel xejn.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
It's pretty early in the morning.	Huwa pjuttost kmieni filgħodu.
I have no other job.	M'għandi l-ebda xogħol ieħor.
He had taken everything.	Huwa kien ħa kollox.
Plus, he wasn’t the only one.	Barra minn hekk, ma kienx hu biss.
I just had to.	Kelli biss.
He couldn't think.	Ma setax jaħseb.
No one goes home.	Ħadd ma jmur id-dar.
This is a car.	Din hija karozza.
Only both.	It-tnejn biss.
Not too early.	Mhux kmieni wisq.
I couldn't say exactly, 'he says.	Ma stajtx ngħid eżatt,' jgħid.
You can’t do this alone.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan waħdek.
I often ask.	Ħafna drabi nistaqsi.
It is not.	Mhuwiex.
I didn't know what to believe.	Ma kontx naf x’se nemmen.
It always works the same.	Dejjem jaħdem l-istess.
You know it won’t.	Taf li mhux se.
I don't think so.	ma naħsibx.
But to say so is not enough either.	Imma li ngħid hekk mhux biżżejjed lanqas.
Come to me.	Jiġi għandi.
Well, there is something else.	Ukoll, hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
I’m going to do something else.	Immur nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
For many things.	Għal ħafna affarijiet.
It could be later.	Seta' jkun aktar tard.
He wouldn’t have to.	Ma kienx ikollu għalfejn.
You want to go see someone.	Trid tmur tara lil xi ħadd.
Not everyone is there.	Mhux kulħadd qiegħed hemm.
I’m surprised you’re here tonight.	Jien sorpriż li int hawn illejla.
I wonder what’s more out there.	Nistaqsi x'hemm aktar hemmhekk.
I want a man who never does it alone.	Irrid raġel li qatt ma jagħmel dan waħdu.
Let me try that.	Ħa nipprova dak.
It was the last thing he expected.	Kienet l-aħħar ħaġa li kien jistenna.
Maybe never again, after what had happened.	Forsi qatt aktar, wara dak li kien ġara.
No more than you.	Mhux aktar milli int.
I think the more you do, the better.	Naħseb li aktar ma tagħmel, aħjar.
Much more has been done than that.	Sar ħafna aktar minn hekk.
They are from here.	Huma minn hawn.
You make it easier for me.	Inti tagħmel dan aktar faċli għalija.
And it’s a big, big problem.	U hija problema kbira u kbira.
But not yet here.	Imma għadu mhux hawn.
Nothing ever happened.	Qatt ma ġara xejn.
Eat at work.	Tiekol fuq ix-xogħol.
You do because she makes sure she does.	Inti tagħmel għaliex hi tagħmel żgur li tagħmel.
He knew what was going on.	Kien jaf x’kien qed jiġri.
He probably was.	Huwa probabbilment kien.
I'm talking about what they're doing.	Qed nitkellem x’qed jagħmlu.
I was expecting this.	Jien kont qed nistenna dan.
I did it for you, for us.	Għamilt għalik, għalina.
I was the only person in the room.	Jien kont l-unika persuna fil-kamra.
It would be good if you did.	Ikun tajjeb jekk tagħmel hekk.
We will do.	Aħna se nagħmlu.
I think everyone knows when he’s around.	Naħseb li kulħadd jaf meta jkun madwar.
You want to tell me where you are going and when.	Trid tgħidli fejn sejjer u meta.
Not the first time, either.	Mhux l-ewwel darba, lanqas.
I can't see.	Ma nistax nara.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
I think we did.	Naħseb li għamilna.
No one knows who she is.	Ħadd ma jaf min hi.
It's not worth living like that.	Mhux ta’ min jgħix hekk.
It was above all, over there.	Kien fuq kollox, hemm fuq.
I will not be able to take anything now.	Mhu se nkun kapaċi nieħu xejn issa.
You are right.	Għandek raġun.
Maybe last time.	Forsi l-aħħar darba.
I couldn’t sit back and do nothing.	Ma stajtx noqgħod lura u ma nagħmel xejn.
I did that.	Jien għamilt dak.
Look.	Ħares.
I don't even know.	Lanqas naf.
She was doing very well.	Kienet tagħmel tajjeb ħafna.
By then, it was too late.	Sa dak iż-żmien, kien tard wisq.
But not too long.	Imma mhux twil wisq.
That was not what he wanted.	Dan ma kienx dak li kien ried.
I would be very busy.	Inkun okkupat ħafna.
I’m getting better now, really.	Jien issa sejjer aħjar, tassew.
This works well for me.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb għalija.
He was supposed to do something.	Huwa suppost kellu jagħmel xi ħaġa.
And much more.	U ħafna aktar.
She was mine.	Hija kienet tiegħi.
It's so much fun.	Huwa daqshekk gost.
We never have time.	Qatt ma għandna ħin.
It happens to a lot of people.	Jiġri lil ħafna nies.
It is now some years later.	Issa huwa xi snin wara.
Not just to do something.	Mhux biss biex tagħmel xi ħaġa.
It couldn’t have happened.	Ma setax ġara.
Maybe now he wants another.	Forsi issa jrid ieħor.
Why? 	Għaliex?
You’re obviously not ready.	Int ovvjament mhux lest.
Not us.	Mhux aħna.
It won’t be for long.	Mhux se jkun għal żmien twil.
It was just him and me.	Kienu hu u jien biss.
I will do it myself.	Jien se nagħmel dan jien.
I always have so much fun.	Jien dejjem nieħu gost hekk.
For a long time.	Għal żmien twil.
The one problem was, there weren’t many people around.	Il-problema waħda kienet, ma kienx hemm ħafna nies madwar.
He was a very good boy.	Kien tifel tajjeb ħafna.
Not that he thought he would.	Mhux li kien ħaseb li kieku.
When it first comes.	Meta tiġi l-ewwel.
There was no problem after that.	Ma kienet l-ebda problema wara dik.
And now he was back.	U issa kien lura.
Come here, please.	Ejja hawn, jekk jogħġbok.
I knew he would do that.	Kont naf li se tagħmel hekk.
He was with me last night.	Kien miegħi lbieraħ filgħaxija.
I want to go home.	Irrid immur id-dar.
He must have thought he had a chance.	Għandu jaħseb li kellu ċans.
Which seems pretty much like what we have now.	Li jidher pjuttost bħal dak li għandna issa.
We don’t even know each other.	Lanqas biss nafu lil xulxin.
There must be other people.	Għandu jkun hemm nies oħra.
Everyone knows this.	Kulħadd jaf dan.
Things often do, you know.	L-affarijiet spiss jagħmlu, taf.
He’s done with that.	Huwa lest ma 'dak.
It was work.	Kien ix-xogħol.
I can’t say enough about it.	Ma nistax ngħid biżżejjed dwarha.
It has always been so for me.	Dejjem kien hekk għalija.
It was the first time she had had so much help.	Din kienet l-ewwel darba li kellha tant għajnuna.
That you will do.	Li int se tagħmel.
She is for me.	Hi għalija.
We only have each other and we are few.	Għandna biss lil xulxin u aħna ftit.
He was a lonely man.	Kien raġel waħdu.
As we do.	Kif nagħmlu aħna.
He had just gone.	Huwa kien għadu kif mar.
And he was right about that.	U kellu raġun dwar dan.
This is not what you want.	Dan mhux dak li trid.
She had to be.	Hija kellha tkun.
He must be there.	Huwa għandu jkun hemm.
But he got there.	Imma wasal hemm.
We can do anything.	Nistgħu nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
There was no one outside.	Ma kien hemm ħadd barra.
Everything came back.	Dak kollu daħal lura.
I think she’s good for it.	Naħseb li hi tajba għalih.
Just do it.	Għamel biss.
It would have been so beautiful.	Kienet tkun daqshekk sabiħa.
Well we are.	Tajjeb aħna.
I have enough money.	Għandi biżżejjed flus.
Not good enough.	Mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
Still bad.	Għadu ħażin.
But he knew it wouldn’t happen.	Imma kien jaf li mhux se jiġri hekk.
I was never there.	Qatt ma kont hemm.
I knew it couldn’t be that way.	Kont naf li ma setax ikun hekk.
That was not enough.	Dan ma kienx biżżejjed.
I'm glad.	Jien ferħan.
It doesn't seem to be working.	Jidher li mhux qed jaħdem.
I can speak now.	Nista’ nitkellem issa.
Le, le le le u le.	Le, le le le u le.
I didn’t have time to be a kid.	Ma kellix ħin biex inkun tifel.
He didn’t know she knew.	Ma kienx jaf li hi kienet taf.
That's for us.	Dak għalina.
It was just where I said it.	Kien biss fejn għidt.
They do nothing.	Huma ma jagħmlu xejn.
I just don’t want to go it alone.	Jien biss ma rridx immur waħdi.
But it was too late.	Imma wasal tard wisq.
Very much in fact.	Ħafna fil-fatt.
It has never been done before.	Qatt ma sar qabel.
You are too young to know.	Inti żgħir wisq biex tkun taf.
He wanted to talk again.	Ried jerġa’ jitkellem.
He was a friend of every man.	Kien ħabib ta’ kull raġel.
I will only go back.	Jien se mmur lura biss.
Why? 	Għaliex?
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
He would do so.	Hekk kien jagħmel.
I don't think so.	ma naħsibx.
Our home is your home.	Id-dar tagħna hija d-dar tiegħek.
It does something to.	Jagħmel xi ħaġa biex.
If it is not already.	Jekk ma jkunx diġà.
It was just doing well as well.	Kien biss qed isir tajjeb ukoll.
And something to eat.	U xi ħaġa li tiekol.
I need someone's help.	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna ta’ xi ħadd minn hemm.
It wasn’t too bad there.	Ma kienx ħażin wisq hemmhekk.
I’ve done a lot more.	Jien stajt nagħmel ħafna aktar.
What it was, it was.	Dak li kien, kien.
Who is it? 	Min hu?
I said it was going to happen.	Għidt li kien se jiġri.
Just me.	Jien biss.
There was never anything there.	Qatt ma kien hemm xejn hemmhekk.
I’m too young for that.	Jien żgħir wisq għal dan.
I thought it was really great.	Ħsibt li kien tassew kbir.
But with you he does.	Imma miegħek jagħmel.
So it's easy.	Hekk hu faċli.
It's not working.	Mhux qed jaħdem.
It was good.	Kien tajjeb.
Friend of a friend.	Ħabib ta’ ħabib.
All right and good.	Kollox tajjeb u tajjeb.
No, you already have.	Le, diġà għandek.
It was time.	Kien wasal iż-żmien.
There was something there.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
Anything can happen now.	Dak kollu li jista’ jiġri issa.
But we will be better.	Imma se nkunu aħjar.
He could have done something.	Seta’ għamel xi ħaġa.
And he still doesn't know.	U għadu ma jafx.
Or better yet.	Jew aħjar għandek.
I don’t even want to talk about it.	Lanqas biss irrid nitkellem dwarha.
For something to happen.	Biex jiġri xi ħaġa.
And it should always be.	U għandu dejjem ikun.
At home there was something she knew about.	Id-dar kien hemm xi ħaġa li kienet taf dwarha.
I have.	Għandi.
Great.	Kbir.
He has no idea.	M’għandux idea.
This was harder than it seemed.	Dan kien aktar diffiċli milli deher.
One is working.	Wieħed qiegħed jaħdem.
It happened.	Ġara.
He knew there was a problem.	Kien jaf li kien hemm problema.
She would never come back.	Qatt ma kienet tiġi lura.
It does so.	Isir hekk.
It had to be.	Kellu jkun.
It didn’t leave that way.	Mhux telaq hekk.
I have to do more.	Għandi nagħmel aktar.
Everything, it seemed, was waiting.	Kollox, deher, kien qed jistenna.
Just what he needed.	Biss dak li kellu bżonn.
She didn't know what to say.	Ma kinitx taf x’qed tgħid.
No one was sure why.	Ħadd ma kien ċert għaliex.
All of the above.	Kollha hawn fuq.
I know he is telling the truth.	Naf li qed jgħid il-verità.
In the evening.	Filgħaxija.
I will try today.	Se nipprova llum.
I couldn't even think.	Lanqas stajt naħseb.
This is definitely what seems to have happened.	Dan żgur hu dak li jidher li ġara.
Let me have.	Ejja Għandi.
Some time passed.	Għadda ftit ħin.
I was just trying to be good.	Kont qed nipprova nkun tajjeb biss.
She didn't even know.	Lanqas kienet taf.
Please look at the door.	Jekk jogħġbok ħares lejn il-bieb.
The things he must have seen.	L-affarijiet li jrid ikun ra.
It was one or the other.	Kien wieħed jew ieħor.
We need to know this.	Irridu nkunu nafu dan.
More than anything.	Aktar minn xejn.
It was there then and it was still here now.	Kien hemm dak iż-żmien u kien għadu hawn issa.
No, he would have to do things his way.	Le, kien ikollu jagħmel l-affarijiet kif tiegħu.
By then it would be too late.	Sa dak iż-żmien ikun tard wisq.
Kellha.	Kellha.
You know how this works.	Taf kif jaħdem dan.
And this should not be difficult.	U dan m'għandux ikun diffiċli.
He's back there.	Huwa lura hemm.
So be it.	Hekk ikun.
But now we know they were there.	Imma issa nafu li kienu hemm.
Now everything works.	Issa kollox jaħdem.
It will take everyone.	Se tieħu lil kulħadd.
Everything you need to know.	Dak kollu li għandek bżonn tkun taf.
I'm with someone.	Jien ma' xi ħadd.
It will still be there for a few years.	Għadu jkun hemm għal ftit snin.
I was doing it.	Jien kont nagħmel.
I love it completely.	Inħobb għal kollox.
Not me.	Mhux jien.
And someone did.	U xi ħadd għamel.
I wasn’t worried about anyone seeing it.	Ma kontx inkwetat li xi ħadd jara.
He could do a little more now.	Huwa seta 'jagħmel ftit aktar issa.
It's the way it is.	Huwa mod kif tkun.
In fact, it can help.	Fil-fatt, jista 'jgħin.
I, he said.	Jien, qal.
He found out about.	Huwa sar jaf dwar .
That works for me.	Li jaħdem għalija.
He could not speak.	Ma setax jitkellem.
You can see forever.	Tista 'tara għal dejjem.
But they were together.	Imma kienu flimkien.
We may know more.	Nistgħu nkunu nafu aktar.
I needed to see.	Kelli bżonn nara.
Not someone else's.	Mhux ta’ xi ħadd ieħor.
If it’s not money, it’s something else.	Jekk mhux flus, hija xi ħaġa oħra.
You were just a small child.	Inti kont tifel żgħir biss.
It should be.	Għandu jkun.
he asked.	staqsa.
I had to think.	I kellha ħsibt.
But she never did.	Imma qatt ma għamlet.
I think it was great.	Naħseb li kien kbir.
But this was not happening.	Imma dan ma kienx qed jiġri.
He is doing this to see what he will do.	Huwa qed jagħmel dan biex jara x'se tagħmel.
This happened earlier today as well.	Dan ġara aktar kmieni llum ukoll.
That was a long time ago.	Dak kien żmien twil ilu.
I rather like it that way.	Jien pjuttost inħobb hekk.
It's one to see.	Huwa wieħed biex tara.
Not much has been done.	Ma tantx sar.
I was happy to try.	Kont kuntent li nipprova.
And of course we can go now.	U ovvjament nistgħu mmorru issa.
He will not be able to.	Mhux se jkun kapaċi.
No one yet knows who will come back.	Ħadd għadu ma jaf min se jiġi lura.
I’ve been doing this now.	Jien stajt nagħmel dan issa.
But now it is too late.	Imma issa huwa tard wisq.
Are you still there? 	Għadek hemm?
Worried but ready.	Inkwetat imma lest.
He’s not one now, either.	Hu mhux wieħed issa, lanqas.
I still don't think so.	Għadni ma naħsibx.
Good! 	Tajjeb!
You can be sure he won't be here.	Tista’ tkun ċert li mhux se jkun hawn.
You make a good one.	Int tagħmel waħda tajba.
I don’t even want to know.	Lanqas irrid inkun naf.
And so it was.	U hekk kien.
Just me and you.	Jien u int biss.
That was me.	Dak kont jien.
The same.	L-istess.
Anyone can.	Kull persuna tista'.
He can wait.	Jista' jistenna.
Obviously there is a late, very late.	Ovvjament hemm tard, tard ħafna.
No one seems to be around.	Ħadd ma jidher li jkun madwar.
Maybe tomorrow evening.	Forsi għada filgħaxija.
They are doing a good job.	Qed jagħmlu xogħol tajjeb.
It had to be something more than that, for sure.	Kellha tkun xi ħaġa aktar minn hekk, żgur.
I have been trying to understand for years.	Ilni snin nipprova nifhem.
Do this beforehand.	Għamel dan qabel.
I may not know it today.	Jien forsi ma nafx illum.
This really happens.	Dan verament jiġri.
Or so one might think.	Jew hekk wieħed jaħseb.
We will not do that.	Dan mhux se nagħmlu.
I just had to know.	Kelli biss inkun naf.
But she just had to say it.	Imma kellha biss tgħid hekk.
That couldn't be.	Li ma setax ikun.
Do nothing.	Ma tagħmel xejn.
And so it happened.	U hekk ġara.
This was not a big deal.	Dan ma kienx xi ħaġa kbira.
Worth a try.	Ta’ min jipprova.
I got there in the afternoon.	Wasal hemm wara nofsinhar.
Now you are with me.	Issa int miegħi.
There, everything goes.	Hemmhekk, kollox imur.
It's this.	Huwa dan.
Not easy, never easy.	Mhux faċli, qatt faċli.
There is nothing more you can do.	M'hemm xejn aktar li tista 'tagħmel.
But all right.	Imma kollox tajjeb.
It's very outward.	Huwa ħafna fuq barra.
That's what she had.	Hekk kellha hi.
He lived forever.	Kien jgħix għal dejjem.
He has to now.	Huwa għandu issa.
He seemed to be working.	Deher li kien qed jaħdem.
It was good when there was just me.	Kien tajjeb meta kien hemm jien biss.
If you need any help, let’s have it.	Jekk għandek bżonn xi għajnuna, ejja għandna.
But he wasn’t saying, not yet.	Imma ma kienx jgħid, għadu mhux.
Or a child.	Jew tifel.
You can't.	Ma tistax.
I think a lot happens.	Naħseb li jiġri ħafna.
I can't say what's going on.	Ma nistax ngħid x'inhu jiġri.
I had thought about it many times.	Kien ħsibt dwarha ħafna drabi.
I didn't hear anything.	Jien ma smajt xejn.
I knew what was going to happen.	Kont naf x’kien se jiġri.
I came here for some work.	Ġejt hawn għal xi xogħol.
That takes something else.	Li tieħu xi ħaġa oħra.
It can be a problem.	Tista' tkun problema.
I don’t need to know anything else.	M'għandix bżonn inkun naf xi ħaġa oħra.
That really started it all.	Li verament beda kollox.
I would like to hear a little more.	Nixtieq nisma' ftit aktar.
He had no idea what he was going to say.	Ma kellux idea x’se jgħid.
I want us to be friends.	Nixtieq li nkunu ħbieb.
I could never understand that.	Qatt ma stajt nifhem hekk.
I’m sure he doesn’t.	Jien ċert li ma jagħmilx hekk.
No one knows for sure.	Ħadd ma jaf żgur.
But things are better now.	Imma l-affarijiet huma aħjar issa.
All for nothing.	Kollox għal xejn.
Or rather, it was there, a long time ago.	Jew aħjar, kien hemm, żmien twil ilu.
He couldn't do it.	Ma setax għamel.
It seems like nothing.	Jidher li xejn.
And that's a good thing.	U din hija ħaġa tajba.
It really doesn't.	Huwa verament ma.
A little of that, a little of that.	Ftit minn dan, ftit minn dak.
It's better not to.	Huwa aħjar li le.
It was here more.	Kien hawn aktar.
I would like to go again.	Nixtieq nerġa' mmur.
She never did.	Hija qatt ma għamlet hekk.
You don’t need to do anything else.	M'għandekx bżonn tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
I think you will be very happy.	Naħseb li tkun kuntent ħafna.
Not even tonight.	Lanqas illejla.
Int.	Int.
I don’t want that.	Jien ma rridx hekk.
It was much better.	Kienet ħafna aħjar.
I'm not with him.	Jien mhux miegħu.
Or not happy.	Jew ma tkunx kuntent.
But I can't do that.	Imma ma nistax nagħmel dan.
He was not going to come back.	Ma kienx se jiġi lura.
I definitely knew about it.	Żgur li kont naf dwarha.
I saw his work.	Rajt ix-xogħol tiegħu.
He can live again.	Jista’ jerġa’ jgħix.
I have to go home.	Jien għandi mmur id-dar.
But there was nothing today.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn illum.
But let’s go there.	Imma ejja mmorru hemmhekk.
Another good thing about it.	Ħaġa oħra tajba dwarha.
We did.	Għamilna.
I'm not sure.	M'inix ċert.
No one goes alone.	Ħadd ma jmur waħdu.
How only you.	Kif biss int.
Someone is doing this.	Xi ħadd qed jagħmel dan.
It should.	Għandu.
I'm sure there is.	Jien ċert li hemm.
You are so right.	Inti daqshekk raġun.
That’s what you’re doing.	Huwa dak li qed tagħmel.
We just don't.	Aħna biss le.
But we were not here.	Imma aħna ma kienx hawn.
But most people are.	Imma ħafna nies huma.
They were easy to expect.	Kienu faċli li wieħed jistenna.
He came to help.	Huwa daħal biex jgħin.
I've been around.	Stajt kont madwar.
Which is not.	Li mhux.
A little too fast.	Ftit wisq malajr.
I can’t really go wrong here.	Ma nistax verament tmur ħażin hawn.
Of what we did.	Ta’ dak li għamilna.
He is watching.	Qed jara.
You may be ahead of your time.	Inti tista 'tkun qabel il-ħin tiegħek.
A few years.	Ftit snin.
You don’t have to eat it all.	M'għandekx għalfejn tiekol dan kollu.
It was too much, too fast.	Kien wisq, malajr wisq.
It is good to drive.	Huwa tajjeb biex isuq.
We are everything to each other.	Aħna kollox għal xulxin.
Usually she did.	Normalment hi għamlet.
Please let's.	Jekk jogħġbok ejja.
You have done so much for us.	Inti għamilt ħafna għalina.
If she only knew.	Kieku kienet taf.
But she wasn't, sure.	Imma hi ma kinitx, żgur.
I was very happy with that.	Kont kuntent ħafna b'dan.
Not so, of course.	Mhux hekk, ovvjament.
I just sat down waiting.	I biss poġġa bilqiegħda nistenna.
Just to see what happened.	Biss biex tara x'ġara.
He was already a man.	Kien diġà raġel.
Kelli.	Kelli.
As always it was.	Bħal dejjem kien.
I didn’t want to go wrong.	Ma ridtx li tmur ħażin.
More on that later !.	Aktar dwar dan aktar tard!.
This was not proper.	Dan ma kienx kif suppost.
I wasn’t trying, please, no.	Ma kontx nipprova, jekk jogħġbok, le.
But something better than nothing.	Imma xi ħaġa aħjar minn xejn.
That’s not a job for you.	Dak mhux xogħol għalik.
More likely to.	Aktar probabbli li.
I'm not very good.	Jien ma tantx tajjeb.
I would love to hear about it.	Nixtieq nisma dwar dan.
Looks like it never happened.	Qisu qatt ma ġara.
But it's worth it, that's for sure !.	Imma ta 'min jagħmel, dan huwa żgur!.
He only knew he needed one.	Kien jaf biss li kellu bżonn wieħed.
But we do so much more.	Imma nagħmlu ħafna aktar.
It does nothing.	Ma jagħmel xejn.
Now here's a problem.	Issa hawn problema.
I didn’t want to go.	Ma riedx immur.
You know what's going to happen.	Taf x’se jiġri.
And you don’t have to.	U m'għandekx għalfejn.
I had to take a chance.	Kelli nagħmel ċans.
To speak.	Biex titkellem.
It actually works well as well.	Fil-fatt jaħdem tajjeb ukoll.
Where does it go from here ?.	Fejn imur minn hawn?.
Tell me.	Tgħidli.
That's the first one.	Dik hija l-ewwel waħda.
You can do whatever you want in your own.	Tista 'tagħmel dak li tixtieq fi tiegħek.
I don’t know why he does that.	Ma nafx għaliex jagħmel hekk.
Where you are now is good.	Fejn int qiegħed issa huwa tajjeb.
But apparently not.	Imma milli jidher le.
That was hard to say.	Dan kien diffiċli li tgħid.
It was going pretty well.	Kien sejjer pjuttost tajjeb.
He had no idea how.	Ma kellux idea kif.
No, maybe not.	Le, forsi mhux se.
And it can go with so many things.	U jista 'jmur ma' tant affarijiet.
It's not the same.	Mhuwiex l-istess.
Easy for you to tell.	Faċli għalik li tgħid.
I know I am.	Naf li jien.
I know he did.	Naf li għamel.
I know you are not.	Naf li m'intix.
It was going very well.	Kien sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
He did not know what he was doing.	Ma kienx jaf x’kien qed jagħmel.
I needed some time.	Kelli bżonn xi żmien.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
So be it.	Hekk suppost tkun.
He knew he had nothing to fear.	Kien jaf li ma kellux għalfejn jibża’.
No one was worried.	Ħadd ma kien inkwetat.
Enough.	Biżżejjed.
But when he got there, it was too late.	Imma meta wasal hemm, kien tard wisq.
I want to do better.	Irrid nagħmel aħjar.
He couldn't.	Ma setax.
It is and is not.	Huwa u mhux.
It's too late for that.	Huwa tard wisq għal dan.
That’s when you know it’s time.	Dak hu meta taf li wasal iż-żmien.
Nothing seemed to work.	Xejn ma deher li jaħdem.
It's my job.	Huwa xogħol tiegħi.
But nothing went wrong.	Imma xejn ma mar ħażin.
There was no work.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda xogħol.
But it was the truth.	Imma kienet il-verità.
It is too early to do much of this.	Għadu kmieni wisq biex tagħmel ħafna minn dan.
Most likely, it is both.	Ħafna probabbli, huwa t-tnejn.
Loved to know.	Iħobb ikun jaf.
For years, really.	Għal snin, tassew.
I wasn’t so sure.	Ma kontx daqshekk ċert.
I had to be.	I kellha tkun.
Much better than me.	Ħafna aħjar minni.
There is no way to do that.	M'hemm l-ebda mod kif tagħmel dan.
But it was.	Imma kien.
But we are.	Imma aħna.
I'm not there.	Jien mhux hemm.
I loved that house.	Dik id-dar kont inħobb.
It’s there, of course.	Qiegħed hemm, ovvjament.
No one had a chance to survive.	Ħadd ma kellu ċans jgħix.
He had not yet had a chance to eat.	Kien għadu ma kellux ċans jiekol.
It’s like when I was in school.	Huwa bħal meta kont l-iskola.
Nothing there, either.	Xejn hemm, lanqas.
It will be easy now.	Issa se jkun faċli.
It's good for me !.	Huwa tajjeb għalija!.
Everyone works hard on the work they do.	Kulħadd jaħdem ħafna fuq ix-xogħol li jagħmel.
It was not easy.	Ma kienx faċli.
And not hard to do.	U mhux diffiċli li tagħmel.
This is quite a bit of money.	Dan huwa pjuttost ftit flus.
I’m not just saying that.	Jien mhux biss ngħid hekk.
I have people.	Għandi nies.
But that was something.	Imma dik kienet xi ħaġa.
I love everyone happy.	Jien inħobb lil kulħadd kuntent.
Definitely buy one.	Żgur li nixtri wieħed.
It seemed like it was both.	Deher li kienet it-tnejn.
But no more.	Imma mhux aktar.
This she cannot do.	Dan hi ma tistax tagħmel.
Good for most people.	Tajjeb għal ħafna nies.
She does sometimes.	Hija tagħmel xi drabi.
I can't think why.	Ma nistax naħseb għaliex.
That was the truth.	Din kienet il-verità.
I love one.	Inħobb wieħed.
But that’s where we are again.	Imma dak huwa fejn aħna mill-ġdid.
She was worried for nothing.	Hija kienet inkwetat għal xejn.
And it was.	U kien.
I think a lot about what makes this work.	Naħseb ħafna dwar dak li jagħmel dan jaħdem.
He wanted it that way too.	Ried hekk ukoll.
He looked at me.	Huwa ħares lejn lili.
It just can't work.	Biss ma jistax jaħdem.
And for a while, that was a problem.	U għal xi żmien, dik kienet problema.
It didn’t have to be that way.	Ma kellux ikun hekk.
He just looked like any other man.	Huwa biss deher bħal kull raġel ieħor.
One can help, and it is worth a try.	Wieħed jista 'jgħin, u ta' min jipprova.
In fact it wasn’t so bad.	Fil-fatt ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
He was trying there.	Kien jipprova hemm.
Only, not this.	Biss, mhux dan.
That would have been difficult.	Dan kien ikun diffiċli.
He said this.	Huwa qal dan.
I wonder about that.	Nistaqsi dwar dan.
I have never said such things.	Qatt ma għidt affarijiet bħal dawn.
But not much.	Imma mhux ħafna.
No, he wants to eat, he says.	Le, irid jiekol, jgħid.
Very glad to see this.	Ferħan ħafna li nara dan.
I did wrong.	Għamilt ħażin.
I didn't tell anyone what happened.	Jien ma għedt lil ħadd x’ġara.
I didn’t really think about it.	Jien ma tantx ħsibt dwarha.
No one knows how.	Ħadd ma jaf kif.
It is working well now.	Issa qed jaħdem tajjeb.
She was doing it all on her own.	Hija kienet tagħmel dan kollu waħedha.
It’s good, but not so good.	Huwa tajjeb, imma mhux daqshekk tajjeb.
He has problems.	Għandu problemi.
I’m glad she did so well.	Jien ferħan li għamlet daqshekk tajjeb.
I still don’t have to go.	Għadni m'għandix immur.
And it’s a big problem.	U hija problema kbira.
Only you.	Inti biss.
He never had a car.	Hu qatt ma kellu karozza.
Now we have too.	Issa għandna wisq.
It was the first time this had happened.	Kienet l-ewwel darba li ġara.
That's enough time.	Dak iż-żmien biżżejjed.
I don’t know if that’s it.	Ma nafx jekk dan hux.
I’m not even sure where it comes from.	Jien lanqas ċert minn fejn ġej.
It's good for you.	Huwa tajjeb għalik.
Easy and hard.	Faċli u diffiċli.
I’m sure this will be fine.	Jien ċert li dan se jkun tajjeb.
Please try again.	Ipprova mill-ġdid.
This remains the same.	Dan jibqa l-istess.
He told me no.	Huwa qalli le.
It was great for me.	Kien tajjeb ħafna għalija.
I’m sure it was great.	Jien ċert li kien kbir.
It has always been so.	Dejjem kienet hekk.
I want you to stay with me.	Irrid li toqgħod miegħi.
Everything you do is wrong.	Dak kollu li tagħmel huwa ħażin.
Same but not the same.	L-istess imma mhux l-istess.
I don’t know where it came from.	Ma nafx minn fejn ġie.
Never almost everyone.	Qatt kważi kulħadd.
This is not what happens.	Dan mhux dak li jiġri.
I know better now, of course.	Naf aħjar issa, ovvjament.
It was better not to know.	Kien aħjar li ma tkunx taf.
And, boy, were they ever.	U, tifel, kienu qatt.
They are the same thing.	Huma l-istess ħaġa.
I take that.	Jien nieħu dik.
We knew that.	Dan konna nafu.
No one wanted to do anything.	Ħadd ma ried jagħmel xejn.
And if she were there.	U kieku kienet hemm.
You are who you are.	Int min int.
I thought a lot.	Ħsibt ħafna.
It goes that way.	Imur hekk.
This is a great thing.	Din hija ħaġa kbira.
I'm not a bad man.	Jien mhux raġel ħażin.
Now he will come with us.	Issa se tiġi magħna.
That’s not what you say.	Dak mhux dak li tgħid.
He's just a little boy.	Huwa biss tifel żgħir.
It was, of course, too late.	Kien, ovvjament, tard wisq.
I went to work, actually.	Jien mort ix-xogħol, fil-fatt.
And in fact, very difficult.	U fil-fatt, diffiċli ħafna.
Most people do.	Ħafna nies jagħmlu.
That's the way it should be.	Dak kif għandu jkun.
Whatever, whatever.	Ikun xi jkun, ikun.
You usually can't do that.	Normalment ma tistax tagħmel dan.
You can't go wrong with much like this.	Inti ma tistax tmur ħażin ma 'ħafna bħal dan.
Maybe they were pretty much the same thing.	Forsi kienu pjuttost l-istess ħaġa.
Really fun too.	Tassew gost ukoll.
Never to me.	Qatt lili.
She didn’t have to do that.	Hija ma kellha tagħmel hekk.
It was great.	Kien kbir.
We knew nothing about anything.	Ma konna nafu xejn dwar xejn.
I'm here now.	Jien hawn issa.
But it can.	Imma jista’ jkollu.
It took a while.	Ħa ftit ħin.
You can't tell about that.	Inti ma tistax tgħid dwar dan.
You can go to school if you want.	Tista' tmur l-iskola jekk trid.
It will not work again.	Mhux se jerġa’ jaħdem.
Friday, he said.	Il-Ġimgħa, qal.
And so it was.	U hekk kienet hi.
I won’t talk about that anymore today.	Mhux se nitkellem aktar dwar dan illum.
And it seemed too late now.	U deher li kien tard wisq issa.
I believe it is the same for everyone.	Nemmen li huwa l-istess għal kull wieħed.
It would take too long.	Ikun jieħu wisq żmien.
Whatever you need.	Tkun xi tkun għandek bżonn.
There was a boy too.	Kien hemm tifel ukoll.
I was so glad she did.	Kont ferħan ħafna li għamlet.
I'm early now.	Jien issa huwa kmieni.
I just want to get the job done.	Irrid biss nagħmel ix-xogħol.
And maybe that’s it.	U forsi huwa dak.
Yesterday evening you go.	Ilbieraħ filgħaxija tmur.
I could never be.	Qatt ma stajt inkun.
Same so.	L-istess hekk.
You are capable.	Inti kapaċi.
I will be your friend from now on.	Jien se nkun ħabib tiegħek minn issa.
It's good for everyone.	Huwa tajjeb għal kulħadd.
This is for you.	Dan huwa għalik.
No one loved him too much.	Ħadd ma kien iħobb wisq.
That's it for.	Dak huwa hemm għal.
You did everything.	Int għamilt kollox.
But just before we did, that’s what happened.	Imma eżatt qabel għamilna, dan huwa dak li ġara.
I knew that.	Jien kont naf dan.
If he ever did.	Jekk qatt għamel.
I didn’t see anything.	Ma kontx tara xi ħaġa.
Now you.	Issa int.
It's really easy.	Huwa tassew faċli.
They are out.	Huma barra.
Really bad idea.	Idea tassew ħażina.
Well, it was wrong.	Ukoll, kien ħażin.
How do you plan to do that.	Kif qed tippjana li tagħmel dan.
Maybe not tomorrow.	Forsi mhux għada.
I go further.	Immur aktar.
You have your time.	Għandek il-ħin tiegħek.
I would be very happy.	Inkun kuntent ħafna.
I can't be sure either.	Lanqas nista’ nkun ċert.
So she had to.	Hekk kellha.
She knew better than that.	Kienet taf aħjar minn hekk.
He would never do that.	Hu qatt ma kien se jagħmel dan.
He has something you like.	Huwa għandu xi ħaġa li tixtieq.
They all need help, fast.	Kollha kemm huma għandhom bżonn l-għajnuna, malajr.
I can do a lot with this.	Jien nista' nagħmel ħafna b'dan.
He could always have.	Dejjem seta' jkollu.
Having said that.	Wara li qal li.
And that’s what she did.	U dan huwa dak li għamlet.
She is here.	Hi hawn.
He said nothing wrong.	Ma qal xejn ħażin.
He was a man.	Kien raġel.
I think it looks better.	Naħseb li jidher aħjar.
I have no idea what he's doing.	M’għandi l-ebda idea x’qed jagħmel.
That was all your idea.	Din kienet kollha idea tiegħek.
That would be a bad thing.	Din tkun xi ħaġa ħażina.
Everyone became friends with him.	Kulħadd sar ħabib miegħu.
If you know, you know.	Jekk taf, taf.
He really does work.	Huwa tassew jagħmel xogħol.
I can say too much.	Nista’ ngħid wisq.
And ready to talk.	U lest biex jitkellem.
Everyone knows about this already.	Kulħadd jaf dwar dan diġà.
I would.	Inkun.
It will not always be so.	Mhux dejjem se jkun hekk.
I did this once.	Għamilt dan darba.
It's from everyone.	Huwa minn kulħadd.
I'm just thinking, 'he said.	Qed naħseb biss,’ qal.
You could have been me.	Int tista’ kont, kieku kont jien.
Maybe it was.	Forsi kienet.
They are.	Dawn huma.
You don’t want to go back to where you were.	Ma tridx tmur lura fejn kont.
I'm easier to please now.	Jien aktar faċli biex jekk jogħġbok issa.
He seems to know about things.	Jidher li jaf dwar l-affarijiet.
There will be no problem.	Mhux se jkun hemm problema.
I want to be the last.	Irrid inkun l-aħħar.
He has been doing this for over a year.	Ilu jagħmel dan għal aktar minn sena.
Sorry for this afternoon.	Jiddispjaċini għal dan wara nofsinhar.
There has to be something we can do.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa li nistgħu nagħmlu.
I have to tell you the truth.	Ikolli ngħidlek il-verità.
And there is very little time.	U ma tantx hemm ħin.
There was nothing.	Ma kien hemm xejn.
Or early in the morning.	Jew kmieni filgħodu.
It's getting late.	Qed isir tard.
Before it's too late.	Qabel ma jkun tard wisq.
I know where they are at home.	Naf fejn huma d-dar.
here you are.	hawn int.
How can.	Kif jista’.
I knew one.	Kont naf wieħed.
I wonder why this is.	Nistaqsi għaliex dan hu.
It was one he hadn’t seen before.	Kien wieħed li ma kienx ra qabel.
I thought it was more than that.	Ħsibt li kien aktar minn hekk.
Nothing really happened there.	Tassew ma ġara xejn hemmhekk.
He is a good boy.	Huwa tifel tajjeb.
We will be late.	Se nkunu tard.
I don't know.	Jien ma nafx.
Not even today.	Lanqas illum.
You must.	Int trid.
Everyone still lives, together.	Kulħadd għadu jgħix, flimkien.
I know it must be hard.	Naf li għandu jkun diffiċli.
And we can do better than that.	U nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar minn hekk.
After who knows.	Wara min jaf.
Or maybe never.	Jew forsi qatt.
She would be like that.	Hi tkun hekk.
And there is much more.	U hemm ħafna aktar.
Look at that.	Ħares lejn dak.
It's been a long time.	Ilu ħafna.
Many are never the same.	Ħafna qatt ma huma l-istess.
I actually had one.	Fil-fatt kelli waħda.
But you can't tell.	Imma ma tistax tgħid.
I was better.	Kont aħjar.
He was not leaving.	Ma kienx jitlaq.
I will be back soon.	Jien se nkun lura dalwaqt.
She had to think.	Kellha taħseb.
Before that, actually.	Qabel dan, fil-fatt.
I still wasn't sure who that was.	Għadu ma kienx ċert min kien dak.
I'm sure.	Jien ċert.
But not and never was.	Imma mhux u qatt ma kien.
This is really a thing.	Din hija tassew ħaġa.
But he needed more.	Imma kellu bżonn aktar.
That is what it is.	Dan huwa dak li hu.
I hope it goes a little better tomorrow.	Nispera li għada tmur ftit aħjar.
Something must have happened.	Għandu jkun ġara xi ħaġa.
It was the only time he lost.	Kienet l-unika darba li tilef.
I hope you can just come and talk someday.	Nittama li tista' tiġi biss u titkellem xi darba.
He could have gone every time.	Seta’ mar kull darba.
I think that’s a great thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa kbira.
Never be.	Qatt ma jkun.
It looks the same as when he lived with us.	Jidher l-istess bħal meta kien jgħix magħna.
He loved to happen and play.	Kien iħobb jiġri u jilgħab.
He would soon be home.	Dalwaqt kien ikun id-dar.
But at that time I thought nothing of it.	Imma dak iż-żmien ma ħsibt xejn.
It wasn’t what he wanted.	Ma kienx dak li ried.
I had to know better.	I kellha naf aħjar.
So is your job.	Hekk ukoll ix-xogħol tiegħek.
You can always tell someone else.	Dejjem tista’ tgħid lil xi ħadd ieħor.
It could be nothing more.	Jista 'jkun xejn aktar.
Nothing worth eating here.	Xejn ta' min tiekol hawn.
Maybe it was.	Forsi kien.
I'm going with you.	Jien immur miegħek.
I have nothing to say.	M'għandi xejn xi ngħid.
It has to happen.	Għandu jiġri.
That’s what happens.	Huwa dak li jiġri.
Now she really knows.	Issa hi tassew taf.
But only once.	Imma darba biss.
There is no problem.	M'hemm l-ebda problema.
I don’t think anything else.	Ma naħsibx xi ħaġa oħra.
This he knew better than anyone.	Dan kien jaf aħjar minn ħadd.
You do a lot of other things, too.	Inti tagħmel ħafna affarijiet oħra, ukoll.
There is no one else who can do it.	M'hemm ħadd ieħor li jista 'jagħmel dan.
We had to know better.	Kellna nafu aħjar.
I wonder if this will work.	Nistaqsi jekk dan hux se jaħdem.
But boy is he interested and ready now.	Imma tifel huwa interessat u lest issa.
I’m so tired of thinking about it.	Jien tant għajjien li naħseb dwar dan.
That's what it was about.	Dan huwa dak li kien dwar.
But that wasn't bad enough.	Imma dan ma kienx ħażin biżżejjed.
For almost three years.	Għal kważi tliet snin.
We are back home now.	Aħna lura d-dar issa.
I know where I'm going.	Naf fejn sejjer.
Someone could have done something.	Xi ħadd seta’ għamel xi ħaġa, seta’.
He never appears again.	Hu qatt ma jerġa’ jidher wara.
He may be right.	Jista’ jkollu raġun.
We are about the same size.	Aħna madwar l-istess daqs.
He is so right.	Huwa daqshekk raġun.
It takes a lot.	Jieħu ħafna.
Now.	Issa.
No it couldn’t be, he thought.	Le ma setax ikun, ħaseb.
No more fun.	Mhux aktar gost.
Not for you, either.	Mhux għalik, lanqas.
He was sitting there.	Kien bilqiegħda hemm.
Everything is there.	Kollox qiegħed hemm.
More than many.	Aktar minn ħafna.
I had to do things.	Kelli nagħmel l-affarijiet.
I understand.	Se nifhem.
But, really, that was better.	Imma, tassew, dan kien aħjar.
But he didn't need to.	Imma ma kellux bżonn.
It appears more than once.	Jidher aktar minn darba.
Money, money, money.	Flus, flus, flus.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
He never was.	Hu qatt ma kien.
This may or may not be.	Dan jista 'jkun jew ma jistax ikun.
I do that.	Jien nagħmel dan.
He didn't even ask.	Lanqas biss talab.
And maybe, sometimes, they do more than that.	U forsi, xi drabi, jagħmlu aktar minn hekk.
Now he plays very well.	Issa jilgħab tajjeb ħafna.
You know how it is.	Taf kif hu.
This is what I want.	Dan hu li rrid.
Great job, as always !.	Xogħol kbir, bħal dejjem!.
He couldn't have done it any other way.	Ma setax jagħmel dan mod ieħor.
Nobody around tonight.	Ħadd madwar illejla.
He knew what he needed.	Kien jaf x’għandu bżonn.
He enjoys playing outside.	Huwa jieħu gost jilgħab barra.
One beautiful thing.	Ħaġa waħda sabiħa.
He needs your help.	Huwa għandu bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
But better than nothing.	Imma aħjar minn xejn.
Like, really late.	Bħal, verament tard.
I think that’s a good thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba.
He had no idea why.	Ma kellux idea għaliex.
What do you think you should do.	Dak li taħseb li għandek tagħmel.
That you.	Li int.
If only he knew what was going on.	Kieku kien jaf x’qed jiġri tassew.
So much has happened.	Tant ġara.
Who knows how it came to be.	Min jaf kif wasal biex ikun hemm.
More on that later.	Aktar dwarha aktar tard.
I still can’t believe anyone does that.	Għadni ma nistax nemmen li xi ħadd jagħmel hekk.
He never had and never will.	Qatt ma kellu u qatt mhu se.
He is surprised.	Huwa sorpriż.
That may be good enough for me.	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb biżżejjed għalija.
Well, that’s about it.	Ukoll, dak huwa dwar kollox.
nara.	nara.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
Just be with us.	Ejja biss magħna.
This is great.	Dan huwa kbir.
He is ready.	Huwa lest.
They are just there.	Huma biss hemm.
He should be playing with me.	Għandu jkun qed jilgħab miegħi.
I have something.	Jien għandi xi ħaġa.
It looked the same as never before.	Deher l-istess bħal qatt qabel.
It's about something.	Huwa fuq xi ħaġa.
Only one problem.	Problema waħda biss.
Maybe that too.	Forsi dan ukoll.
I really believe that.	Jien verament nemmen li.
It was great !.	Kien kbir!.
But for him it was not.	Imma għalih ma kienx.
It's you.	Huwa int.
He is back from anyone.	Huwa lura minn ħadd.
More than that, please.	Aktar minn dan, jekk jogħġbok.
He’s the only one he’s ever had.	Huwa l-uniku wieħed li qatt kellu.
I hadn’t heard of this before.	Ma kontx smajt dan qabel.
Everything is now pretty much gone.	Kollox issa mar pjuttost.
You know everything.	Int taf kollox.
But that was not all.	Imma ma kienx kollox.
Maybe he was already here.	Forsi kien diġà hawn.
It will always be so.	Dejjem ikun hekk.
You're not even from here.	Int lanqas minn hawn.
No one else knows about such things.	Ħadd ieħor ma jaf dwar affarijiet bħal dawn.
He has done so a few times.	Huwa għamel hekk ftit drabi.
He makes and makes good money.	Huwa jagħmel u jagħmel flus tajba.
This I do a lot.	Dan nagħmel ħafna.
But ‘this’ was wrong.	Imma ‘dan’ kien ħażin.
That's all.	Dak hu kollu.
There is another.	Hemm ieħor.
I’m going to do this and want to go.	Jien se nagħmel dan u trid tmur.
It was very difficult.	Kien diffiċli ħafna.
That was so bad.	Dan kien daqshekk ħażin.
Probably.	Probabbilment.
But he was not a boy.	Imma ma kienx tifel.
I said right.	għidt tajjeb.
This can be small in size.	Dan jista 'jkun ta' daqs żgħir.
This was all wrong.	Dan kollu kien ħażin.
What are you talking about?	X’qed titkellem.
I didn’t know any other way to do about it.	Ma kont naf l-ebda mod ieħor kif nagħmel dwarha.
But she needed some time.	Imma kellha bżonn ftit ħin.
Neither is she.	Lanqas hi.
I say no.	Jien ngħid le.
He said nothing about it.	Hu ma qal xejn dwar dan.
.	.
I'm not so sure anymore.	M'inix daqshekk ċert aktar.
There we are.	Hemm aħna.
He was such a good person.	Kien persuna daqshekk tajba.
I think he’s right, he never had a chance.	Naħseb li għandu raġun, qatt ma kellu ċans.
I will say something else.	Jien se ngħid xi ħaġa oħra.
No one had anything to say.	Ħadd ma kellu xi jgħid.
Only other people.	Nies oħra biss.
And it was.	U kien.
It's not supposed to happen.	Mhux suppost jiġri.
I can't understand this.	Ma nistax nista' nifhem dan.
I think you are right.	Naħseb li għandek raġun.
It will come.	Se jiġi.
He will not survive.	Hu mhux se jgħix.
He would have to know that.	Huwa jkollu jkun jaf li.
That's what she wants to do.	Dan hi trid tagħmel.
As you wish.	Kif trid.
I know it would.	Naf li kieku.
But there will be something.	Imma se jkun hemm xi ħaġa.
Barra.	Barra.
I don’t have to hear that.	M'għandix għalfejn nisma' hekk.
It would be better there.	Ikun aħjar hemmhekk.
But who knows.	Imma min jaf.
I'm really fast.	Jien tassew malajr.
Nor was it the first one.	Lanqas ma kienet l-ewwel waħda.
They just aren't there.	Huma biss mhux hemm.
I understand now.	Nifhem issa.
You, if need be.	Int, jekk ikun hemm bżonn.
I’m talking about work.	Nitkellem dwar ix-xogħol.
He probably thought it was better than it actually was.	Probabbilment ħaseb li kien aħjar milli fil-fatt kien.
He had never been there before.	Hu qatt ma kien hemm qabel.
You're way there.	Int mod hemmhekk.
Wondering where someone was.	Mintix fejn kien xi ħadd.
I was going to happen.	I kien jiġri.
She is not yours.	Hi mhix tiegħek.
Come on, we have to go.	Ejja, irridu mmorru.
I'm sorry, but she is.	Jiddispjaċini, imma hi.
This can happen here.	Dan jista 'jiġri hawn.
How did this happen? 	Kif ġara dan?
I think we do that last thing.	Naħseb li nagħmlu dik l-aħħar ħaġa.
They have before and they have after.	Għandhom qabel u għandhom wara.
He had everything.	Kellu kollox.
Once upon a time, it probably was.	Darba, x’aktarx li kienet.
But there was something there.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
There was a boy.	Kien hemm tifel.
I was wrong.	Kont ħażin ħażin.
And we already have.	U diġà għandna.
That was all.	Kien dak kollu.
Well, we can't really.	Ukoll, ma nistgħux verament.
But only for a short time.	Imma għal ftit żmien biss.
I knew it was now or never.	Kont naf li kien issa jew qatt.
No one could.	Ħadd ma seta’.
It was too much for many.	Kien wisq għal ħafna.
One was enough.	Wieħed kien biżżejjed.
And it’s definitely a beautiful thing I did.	U żgur li hija ħaġa sabiħa li għamilt.
We can't do that.	Ma nistgħux nagħmlu dan.
John, who lived there.	John, li kien jgħix hemm.
But she is.	Imma hi.
Maybe you are too.	Forsi int ukoll.
Let’s do this together.	Ejja nagħmlu dan flimkien.
I just was.	Jien biss kont.
Beda.	Beda.
This will probably take a long time.	Dan probabbilment se jieħu ħafna żmien twil.
It’s really pretty good.	Huwa verament pjuttost tajjeb.
This is an easy thing to do.	Din hija ħaġa faċli li tagħmel.
That was me too.	Dak kont jien ukoll.
He knew that too.	Dan kien jaf ukoll.
But he said, no, he would not come with me.	Imma hu qal, le, ma kienx jiġi miegħi.
That’s a really good thing.	Dik hija ħaġa tassew tajba.
No one wanted to be the one to speak.	Ħadd ma ried ikun hu li jitkellem.
You see everything.	Tara kollox.
He still doesn’t know who you are.	Għadu ma jafx min int.
I wasn’t the only one.	Jien ma kontx l-uniku wieħed.
That would be all.	Dak ikun kollu.
He was right to do so.	Kien tajjeb li għamel hekk.
I really didn't want to go.	Verament ma ridtx immur.
But not too fast.	Imma mhux malajr wisq.
Nothing good will ever happen if you do.	Xejn tajjeb qatt ma jiġri jekk tagħmel hekk.
But no one said so.	Imma ħadd ma qal hekk.
This is not people actually doing anything.	Dan mhux nies fil-fatt jagħmlu xi ħaġa.
You need a lot.	Għandek bżonn ħafna.
Until now, everyone knew why.	Sa issa, kulħadd kien jaf għaliex.
Not that there is a problem with this.	Mhux li hemm problema b'dan.
Besides, he's not here.	Barra minn hekk, hu mhux hawn.
We did, and now you too.	Għamilna, u issa int ukoll.
He was good to me.	Kien tajjeb miegħi.
This is what happened.	Dan huwa dak li ġara.
I don’t think it will.	Ma naħsibx li se.
Now it's mine.	Issa huwa tiegħi.
It was so easy.	Kien daqshekk faċli.
I could have done the same.	Seta’ għamilt l-istess ħaġa.
It had to be someone else.	Kellu jkun xi ħadd ieħor.
This was supposed to be easy.	Dan suppost kien faċli.
That's what everyone was doing.	Hekk kien qed jagħmel kulħadd.
And it’s not time yet.	U għadu mhux iż-żmien.
They will do this all the time.	Huma ser jagħmlu dan il-ħin kollu.
He really loved me.	Huwa verament iħobb miegħi.
There is no money.	M'hemm l-ebda flus.
He was sure of it.	Kien ċert minn dan.
I did my job.	Jien għamilt ix-xogħol tiegħi.
No one else can do that.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jagħmel dan.
No one knows how you got there.	Ħadd ma jaf kif ġejt hemm.
That looks like a lot.	Li jidher qisu ħafna.
This seemed to be done more than about the dog.	Dan deher li sar aktar milli dwar il-kelb.
I really want to be his friend.	Irrid verament inkun ħabib tiegħu.
He had no idea what to do.	Ma kellu l-ebda idea x'għandu jagħmel.
This is much better.	Dan huwa ħafna aħjar.
And the time had come.      	U kien wasal iż-żmien.      
It's too early.	Għadu kmieni.
You better come with me.	Aħjar tiġi miegħi.
Everything is there.	Kollox hemm.
I have a better idea.	Għandi idea aħjar.
I had to be here.	I kellha tkun hawn.
Don't do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan.
It became his thing.	Sar ħaġa tiegħu.
I don't know where he is or what he's doing.	Ma nafx fejn hu jew x’qed jagħmel.
They are the same.	Huma l-istess.
She didn't, she really didn't.	Hija ma, tassew hi ma.
It had already happened.	Kien diġà ġara.
That goes with us.	Li jmur magħna.
Come here please.	Ejja hawn jekk jogħġbok.
There was this.	Kien hemm dan.
No, not good.	Le, mhux tajjeb.
You are mine.	Inti tiegħi.
He had no idea where he was going.	Ma kellux idea fejn imur.
I just knew it was over.	Kont naf biss li għadda.
That's too long.	Dak huwa twil wisq.
And in fact he is.	U fil-fatt hu.
He just was there.	Huwa biss kien hemm.
It’s great for him.	Huwa kbir għalih.
He was there for that.	Kien hemm għal dak.
I eat better.	niekol aħjar.
But it is not working.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem.
You don’t have to do that.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel dan.
But he is not so now.	Imma hu mhux hekk issa.
For me, that’s what it is.	Għalija, huwa dak li hu.
Maybe he didn’t want to talk about it.	Forsi ma riedx jitkellem dwarha.
I knew it would come.	Kont naf li se tiġi.
All this.	Dan kollu.
Great teacher.	Għalliem kbir.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
So easy and fast.	Hekk faċli u malajr.
No one is what it seems.	Ħadd mhu dak li jidher.
It's really great.	Huwa tassew kbir.
You are alone now.	Int waħdek issa.
I did that, boy.	Għamilt dan, tifel.
That works for me.	Li qed jaħdem għalija.
I thought there were only a few.	Ħsibt li kien hemm biss ftit.
It was hard to know for sure.	Kien diffiċli li tkun taf żgur.
I will think about it.	Se naħseb dwarha.
It’s not a big problem, but it’s a problem.	Mhix problema kbira, imma hija problema.
I just had to eat.	Kelli biss niekol.
It seems we can do something about it.	Jidher li nistgħu nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwarha.
But if not.	Imma jekk mhux hekk.
I think you need to come home.	Naħseb li għandek bżonn tiġi d-dar.
All you need to do is take a good time.	Kull ma trid tagħmel hu li tieħu ħin tajjeb.
He also knew when.	Kien jaf ukoll meta.
But no !.	Imma le!.
He had done a good job.	Huwa kien għamel xogħol tajjeb.
You are here with me.	Int hawn miegħi.
He said it was too late.	Qal li kien tard wisq.
A lot is happening.	Qed jiġri ħafna.
I want to know what happened.	Irrid inkun naf x'ġara.
She's not me.	Hi mhix jien.
Coming now.	Li ġej issa.
I want to soon.	Irrid dalwaqt.
All his.	Kollha tiegħu.
Before your time, of course.	Qabel il-ħin tiegħek, ovvjament.
That does.	Li jagħmel.
It could have been but.	Seta’ kien imma.
He felt scared.	Ħassu jibża.
It really wasn’t that bad.	Verament ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
And so you have.	U hekk għandek.
She must be going late.	Hija trid tkun qed tmur tard.
But everything went well.	Imma kollox mar tajjeb.
It's the same.	Huwa l-istess.
Someone must be out.	Xi ħadd għandu jkun barra.
I only know this.	Naf dan biss.
You are the only one we know.	Int l-uniku li nafu.
Someone else was always there.	Xi ħadd ieħor kien dejjem hemm.
He is doing nothing.	Mhu qed jagħmel xejn.
I just don’t want to.	Jien biss ma rridx.
I'm sure of it.	Jien ċert minn dan.
That's one thing.	Dik hija ħaġa.
I just have to stay together.	Ikolli biss noqgħod flimkien.
He wasn’t really all there.	Hu ma kienx verament kollu hemm.
No one says so.	Ħadd ma jgħid hekk.
It cannot be more than one.	Ma jistax ikun aktar minn wieħed.
It is not enough.	Mhuwiex biżżejjed.
Ask what happened.	Staqsa x’ġara.
Truly something for everyone.	Tassew xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
They were more than capable.	Kienu aktar minn kapaċi.
We have to go.	Irridu mmorru.
But he never went back to his house.	Imma qatt ma mar lura d-dar tiegħu.
We never knew why.	Qatt ma konna nafu għaliex.
I can't talk to him.	Ma nistax nitkellem miegħu.
Now, and always.	Issa, u dejjem.
That would be tomorrow.	Dak ikun għada.
That's not good.	Dak mhux tajjeb.
Too young not to be surprised.	Żgħir wisq biex ma tkun sorpriż.
Not that he thought it was wrong.	Mhux li kien jaħseb li kien ħażin.
I'm almost there.	Jien kważi hemm.
I love that car.	Jien inħobb dik il-karozza.
We made our way.	Għamilna mod tagħna.
Beloved or not.	Wieħed iħobb jew le.
Maybe it was him.	Forsi kien hu.
I was so tired.	Kont tant għajjien.
We know what to do.	Aħna nafu li tagħmel.
Now on to some other issues.	Issa fuq xi problemi oħra.
We were right, there.	Kellna raġun, hemm.
I didn’t know he was going to be out here.	Ma kontx naf li kien se jkun hawn barra.
Years, years, years.	Snin, snin, snin.
But do it together.	Imma jagħmlu dan flimkien.
Some other way.	Xi mod ieħor.
It seemed to do.	Deher li għamlet.
I really can't wait for that !.	I verament ma nistax nistenna għal dak!.
But that is enough for me.	Imma dan huwa biżżejjed għalija.
What is it? 	X'inhu?
Or maybe not me, they are.	Jew forsi mhux jien, huma huma.
Everyone says so.	Kulħadd jgħid hekk.
I don’t know where they are just.	Ma nafx fejn huma biss.
I was doing the same thing.	Jien kont nagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
You know you have something to say.	Taf li għandek xi tgħid.
I don’t know what should happen.	Ma nafx x'għandu jiġri.
He never said what it was.	Hu qatt ma qal dak li kien.
In fact, it wasn’t so bad.	Fil-fatt, ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
It wasn’t that long ago.	Ma kienx daqshekk twil ilu.
To make more money.	Biex tagħmel aktar flus.
There is a problem.	Hemm problema.
They were something great.	Kienu xi ħaġa kbira.
I don’t want to see these.	Ma rridx li jara dawn.
I was there.	Jien kont hemm.
I hope it’s not too late.	Nittama li mhux tard wisq.
It's people.	Huwa nies.
He still didn’t want to know.	Għadu ma riedx li tkun taf.
We will be back.	Se nkunu lura.
I'm not sure.	M'inix ċert.
We have done it many times.	Għamilna ħafna drabi.
He did both.	Huwa għamel it-tnejn.
I think we know why now.	Naħseb li nafu għaliex issa.
As he lies there he sees, looks but.	Kif jinsab hemm jara, jistenna imma.
I went there.	Jien mort hemmhekk.
It wasn’t too early.	Ma kienx kmieni wisq.
And there it is.	U hemm.
It seemed easy to him.	Deher faċli għalih.
I thought so fast.	Ħsibt daqshekk malajr.
You can go to school.	Tista' tmur l-iskola.
Well, to do that.	Ukoll, li tagħmel dan.
No, he really is.	Le, tassew hu.
He does the same around me.	Huwa jagħmel l-istess madwar tiegħi.
It can be now.	Hija tista 'tkun issa.
As it was, it was not.	Kif kien, ma kienx.
I truly believe that.	Jien tassew nemmen li.
He said it was his.	Qal li kien tiegħu.
There really is.	Verament hemm.
She was now seated.	Issa kienet bilqiegħda.
I still hope someone does, but that someone won’t be me.	Għadni nittama li xi ħadd jagħmel, imma li xi ħadd mhux se nkun jien.
There was a lot to see and not enough time.	Kien hemm ħafna x'tara u mhux biżżejjed ħin.
It's better where she is.	Hija aħjar fejn hi.
Not here.	Mhux hawn.
It probably wasn't.	Probabbilment ma kienx.
You have come back.	Inti ġejt lura.
All the time, actually.	Il-ħin kollu, fil-fatt.
Account.	Kont.
It's time.	Wasal iż-żmien.
I want to know if he will be happy.	Irrid inkun naf jekk hux se jkun kuntent.
Nothing.	Ta 'xejn.
You are not good enough.	M'intix tajjeb biżżejjed.
And so he did.	U hekk għamel.
I wasn’t so sure.	Ma kontx daqshekk ċert.
The same thing happened.	L-istess ħaġa ġara.
There was much more.	Kien hemm ħafna aktar.
You can do this now.	Tista 'tagħmel dan issa.
I'm afraid they are too little.	Nibża li huma ftit wisq.
We will do what we will do.	Aħna se nagħmlu dak li se nagħmlu.
And here's why.	U hawn għaliex.
A lot had happened since then.	Minn dak iż-żmien kien ġara ħafna.
I said no, just a little bit.	Jien għedt le, ftit biss.
That he knew.	Dan kien jaf.
I had.	Kelli.
You are better.	Inti aħjar.
He knew what he was doing.	Kien jaf x’qed tagħmel.
But it never came.	Imma qatt ma wasal.
I recently went home.	Dan l-aħħar mort mort id-dar.
We did very well for what we had.	Għamilna tajjeb ħafna għal dak li kellna.
It was before anything else.	Kien qabel kull ħaġa oħra.
That's what he does.	Dak hu jagħmel.
That was not the case.	Dan ma kienx hekk.
And it wasn’t easy.	U ma kienx faċli.
You have to go.	Int għandek tmur.
They were very helpful in times of need.	Kienu ta’ għajnuna kbira fi żmien ta’ bżonn.
I think there will be.	Naħseb li se jkun hemm.
He hardly knew why.	Ma tantx kien jaf għaliex.
my usually says the same things, over and over.	tiegħi normalment jgħid l-istess affarijiet, aktar u aktar.
I did well.	Għamilt tajjeb.
I may be able to do that.	I jista 'jkun kapaċi nagħmel dan.
There has never been a better time for him to play well.	Qatt ma kien hemm żmien aħjar għalih biex jilgħab tajjeb.
Sena.	Sena.
I had enough.	Kelli biżżejjed.
My car won't.	Il-karozza tiegħi mhux se.
And she was right about how she looked.	U kellha raġun dwar kif kienet tidher.
He saw no one.	Ma ra lil ħadd.
That was yours.	Dak kien tiegħek.
I see mine.	Jien nara tiegħi.
One big big one.	Wieħed kbir kbir.
A man has never been so with me.	Raġel qatt ma kien hekk miegħi.
Ask if it can be.	Staqsa jekk jistax jiġi.
I need to do this.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan.
Definitely I would, you know.	Żgur li nixtieq, taf.
Maybe she was tired.	Forsi kienet għajjien.
It has to, whether it wants to or not.	Għandu, irid jew le.
I had a friend.	Kelli ħabib.
He knew when he was going home.	Kien jaf meta kien se jkun id-dar.
There was no one here.	Ma kien hemm ħadd hawn.
I’m still right.	Għadni raġun.
She wants to know what was going on.	Hija trid tkun taf x'kien qed jiġri.
I don’t know how to do anything else.	Ma nafx kif nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
Nobody knows what it is.	Ħadd ma jaf x’inhu.
But it was nothing.	Imma ma kien xejn.
It’s great, actually.	Huwa kbir, fil-fatt.
I have nothing.	Jien m'għandi xejn.
But you are not a man.	Imma m'intix raġel.
It could be tonight.	Jista 'jkun illejla.
And this is good.	U dan huwa tajjeb.
He had never asked before.	Hu qatt ma kien talab qabel.
That’s a good thing, actually.	Dik hija ħaġa tajba, fil-fatt.
After he died.	Wara li miet.
This is something that too few people are doing.	Din hija xi ħaġa li ftit wisq nies qed jagħmlu.
Only a few people do.	Ftit nies biss jagħmlu.
It all happens fast.	Dan kollu jiġri malajr.
It’s a great way for everyone to talk.	Huwa mod tajjeb ħafna biex kulħadd jitkellem.
When who knew.	Meta min kien jaf.
He knew that what she was saying was the truth.	Kien jaf li dak li kienet qed tgħid kienet il-verità.
So.	Hekk.
This cannot be.	Dan ma jistax ikun.
Really worth playing.	Tassew ta’ min jilgħab.
Something for everyone.	Xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
I'm doing well.	Jien sejjer tajjeb.
There was nothing yet.	Għadu ma kien hemm xejn.
But maybe it’s not a good idea.	Imma forsi mhix idea tajba.
No one knew where he came from.	Ħadd ma kien jaf minn fejn ġie.
As it will appear to me.	Kif se jidher lili.
You are there.	Int hemm.
For a year, actually.	Għal sena, fil-fatt.
She didn't think about it.	Hija ma taħseb dwarha.
It doesn't have to be big.	M’għandux għalfejn ikun xi ħaġa kbira.
That house.	Dak id-dar.
It would be easy.	Ikun faċli.
That you had something to say.	Li kellek xi tgħid.
I will try both.	Se nipprova t-tnejn.
Our first are these.	L-ewwel tagħna huma dawn.
I'm still.	Jien għadni.
That would be really bad.	Dan ikun tassew ħażin.
If you have a job.	Jekk għandek xogħol.
You went to the back.	Int mort fuq wara.
They felt very tired.	Ħassu għajjien ħafna.
In fact, you can do more than that.	Fil-fatt, tista 'tagħmel aktar minn dan.
He’s just glad to have it back.	Huwa biss ferħan li jkollu lura.
He probably should.	Huwa probabbilment għandu.
I try that and see how well it works.	Nipprova dak u nara kemm jaħdem tajjeb.
He loved making friends.	Iħobb jagħmel ħbieb.
But nothing is ever about just one thing.	Imma xejn mhu qatt dwar ħaġa waħda biss.
Too many years.	Wisq snin.
I can't say anything about it.	Ma nista’ ngħid xejn dwarha.
I wanted to say a few things about this.	Ridt ngħid ftit affarijiet dwar dan.
I'm sure you know that.	Jien ċert li taf li.
She's scared, and she's scared.	Jibża’, u jibża’ li jibża’.
It can be a problem.	Tista' tkun problema.
This is bad, so bad.	Dan huwa ħażin, hekk ħażin.
I was right too.	Kelli raġun ukoll.
Same thing.	L-istess ħaġa.
Everything here goes.	Kollox hawn imur.
It appears as one person appears.	Jidher hekk kif tidher persuna waħda.
He comes for.	Huwa ġej għal.
He knew what it was.	Kien jaf x'kien.
I never did.	Jien qatt ma għamilt.
But boy so.	Imma tifel hekk.
Come now.	Ejja issa.
But he couldn't think about it.	Imma ma setax jaħseb dwar dan.
They both have.	It-tnejn li huma għandhom.
Until the last few years.	Sa l-aħħar ftit snin.
And this is really difficult.	U dan huwa verament diffiċli.
She had to know for sure.	Kellha tkun taf żgur.
He did so for a year.	Hekk għamel għal sena.
It's been a while.	Ilu hemm xi żmien.
You can stay there.	Tista 'toqgħod hemm.
You still can't go.	Għadek ma tistax tmur.
There are too many here.	Hemm wisq hawn.
And think about.	U taħseb dwar.
He is.	Huwa hu.
If he had.	Kieku kellu.
I won’t be out for more than a few hours.	Mhux se nkun aktar minn ftit sigħat.
I want to be like that.	Nixtieq inkun hekk.
Still.	Għadu.
You can do whatever you want.	Tista 'tagħmel dak li tixtieq.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
That is being difficult.	Dak qed ikun diffiċli.
They are one thing.	Huma ħaġa waħda.
.	.
You were there.	Int kont hemm.
He knew it would one day happen.	Kien jaf li xi darba kellu jiġri.
They are just almost there.	Huma biss kważi hemm.
This is where she is.	Dan huwa fejn hi.
It’s still school.	Għadu l-iskola.
Little had anything to say.	Ftit kellha xi tgħid.
I believe we can do that.	Nemmen li nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
Great to see.	Kbir biex tara.
And it seems it wasn’t.	U jidher li ma kienx.
But it certainly wasn’t the last.	Imma żgur li ma kienx l-aħħar.
After a while, no one wanted to talk about it.	Wara ftit, ħadd ma ried jitkellem dwarha.
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Imma m'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu dwar dan.
I would say not as bad as you think.	Jien ngħid li mhux ħażin daqs dak li taħseb.
Everyone saw what happened.	Kulħadd ra x’ġara.
I wasn’t sure there for a while.	Jien ma kontx ċert hemm għal ftit żmien.
I have seen this happen many, many times.	Rajt dan jiġri ħafna, ħafna drabi.
But I am.	Imma jien.
It was the first one there.	Kien l-ewwel wieħed hemmhekk.
She was having fun tonight.	Illejla kienet tieħu gost.
Or he thinks he knows.	Jew jaħseb li jaf.
Everyone will help.	Kulħadd se jgħin.
But of course, just me.	Imma ovvjament, jien biss.
Someone else saw this.	Xi ħadd ieħor ra dan.
But try not to.	Imma ipprova ma tagħmilx hekk.
I knew it would.	Kont naf li kieku.
I just wanted to know.	Ridt biss li tkun taf.
I hope this might help.	Nispera li dan forsi jgħin.
I went to his house.	Mort id-dar tiegħu.
Nothing actually was better, probably.	Xejn fil-fatt kien aħjar, probabbilment.
You will soon see that someone.	Dalwaqt tara li xi ħadd.
There he was.	Hemmhekk kien.
So it came here.	Hekk ġie hawn.
He just came to me.	Huwa biss wasal lili.
I have one husband.	Għandi raġel wieħed.
Not after.	Mhux wara.
But really, really good.	Imma tassew tassew tajjeb.
Too much and too often in fact.	Wisq u spiss wisq fil-fatt.
Or we did.	Jew għamilna.
No we don't have enough money for that.	Le m'għandniex biżżejjed flus għal dan.
I had gone too far.	Jien kont mort wisq.
He was not ready.	Huwa ma kienx lest.
It's us or they are.	Huwa aħna jew huma.
Things were so with us.	L-affarijiet kienu hekk magħna.
Or don't.	Jew ma tagħmilx.
I think there is more to it than that.	Qed naħseb li hemm aktar minn hekk.
Everyone was busy.	Kulħadd kien okkupat.
It seems so.	Jidher hekk.
It should be soon.	Għandu jkun dalwaqt.
We know that long ago.	Aħna nafu li twil ilu.
Expect to be there.	Jistenna li nkun hemm.
She may never know this.	Hija qatt ma tista 'tkun taf dan.
I will never be the same.	Qatt ma nkun l-istess.
You don’t want to think so.	Ma tkunx trid taħseb hekk.
This has happened before.	Dan ġara qabel.
I came home.	Ġejt id-dar.
I was working as a man.	Kont qed nagħmel xogħol ta’ raġel.
I was saying.	Kont qed ngħid.
I wasn’t going to be like that.	Ma kontx tkun hekk.
I'm just surprised.	Jien biss sorpriż.
And it wasn’t good.	U ma kienx tajjeb.
Plays well.	Jilgħab tajjeb.
I think we did.	Naħseb li għamilna hekk.
Maybe better that way.	Forsi aħjar hekk.
One is not good and one is not bad.	Wieħed mhux tajjeb u wieħed mhux ħażin.
Nothing.	Mhux xejn.
Everything else is the same.	Kollox ieħor huwa l-istess.
This may have been helpful.	Dan seta' kien ta' għajnuna.
I know where he is.	Naf fejn hu.
Hu le.	Hu le.
I will try again tonight.	Nipprova mill-ġdid illejla.
It was at work.	Kien fuq ix-xogħol.
There is no way out of this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod minn dan.
It's time.	Wasal iż-żmien.
It will not be ready.	Mhux se jkun lest.
I make mine.	Jien nagħmel tiegħi.
This could be better.	Dan jista 'jkun aħjar.
Now there is something.	Issa hemm xi ħaġa.
I knew what he was trying to do.	Kont naf x’kien qed jipprova jagħmel.
But he wasn’t the only one.	Imma ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
He didn’t even know what to do now.	Lanqas ma kien jaf x'għandu jagħmel issa.
For something to do.	Għal xi ħaġa li tagħmel.
That was it.	Dak li kien.
I needed something else.	Jien kelli bżonn xi ħaġa oħra.
He does not speak.	Huwa ma titkellem.
He did not know where he was or what he was doing.	Ma kienx jaf fejn kien jew x’kien.
Everyone said so.	Kulħadd qal hekk.
I tell you no such thing.	Jiena ngħidlek l-ebda ħaġa bħal din.
That she had.	Li kellha.
He had to say something.	Kellu jgħid xi ħaġa.
I was waiting for someone.	Kont qed nistenna lil xi ħadd.
That’s the only way.	Dak hu l-uniku mod.
It was so every time.	Kien hekk kull darba.
Well, it doesn’t really stand for anything.	Ukoll, ma tantx toqgħod għal xejn.
I’m not fast enough.	Jien mhux malajr biżżejjed.
If you want one.	Jekk trid waħda.
If he wanted to.	Jekk ried.
Something not said.	Xi ħaġa mhux qal.
It's more of the same.	Huwa aktar ta 'l-istess.
There you go to school.	Hemmhekk tmur l-iskola.
But so is he.	Imma hekk hu.
It actually makes everything great.	Fil-fatt jagħmel kollox kbir.
You can't help it.	Ma tistax ma tagħmilx hekk.
It's really that easy.	Huwa verament daqshekk faċli.
I never went back.	Jien qatt ma mort lura.
I want to be alone.	Irrid inkun biss waħdi.
He couldn’t do that until then.	Huwa ma setax jagħmel dan sa dak iż-żmien.
Wherever you go, always go with you.	Tmur fejn tmur, dejjem tmur miegħek.
I’ve never seen anything like that.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I see someone saying they were the first.	Nara xi ħadd qal li kienu l-ewwel.
But maybe it was.	Imma forsi kien.
That was the truth.	Dik kienet il-verità.
We did the same thing.	Għamilna l-istess ħaġa.
It may be happening and it may be happening soon.	Jista 'jkun qed jiġri u jista' jkun qed jiġri dalwaqt.
But he did not know.	Imma dan ma kienx jaf.
But he didn’t need much time.	Imma ma kellux bżonn ħafna ħin.
I wasn’t trying to do that.	Jien ma kontx nipprova nagħmel hekk.
There is no other way to say it.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor biex tgħid dan.
This has to be here, that has to be there.	Dan irid ikun hawn, dak irid ikun hemm.
He did what he had to do to win.	Huwa għamel dak li kellu jagħmel biex jirbaħ.
Or maybe he knew exactly where she was.	Jew forsi kien jaf eżatt fejn kienet.
And you can see why.	U wieħed jista’ jara għaliex.
But enough was enough.	Imma biżżejjed kien biżżejjed.
Now we know why.	Issa nafu għaliex.
Now you know why.	Issa taf għaliex.
Three hours later, he died.	Tliet sigħat wara, miet.
Obviously, something was wrong.	Ovvjament, xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
I'm very glad.	Jien ferħan ħafna.
I just wanted to think so.	Ridt biss li taħseb hekk.
From there.	Minn hemm.
It looks good.	Jidher tajjeb.
Everyone knows this.	Kulħadd jaf dan.
But there were too many people in the room.	Imma kien hemm wisq nies fil-kamra.
I can tell.	Nista’ ngħid.
You will like this one.	Inti ser bħal dan wieħed.
Where are you going, 'he said.	Fejn sejjer’, qal.
That's a long time.	Dak huwa żmien twil.
This is going too far.	Dan sejjer wisq.
Just that she did.	Biss li għamlet.
It works very well.	Jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
Today it was me.	Illum kont jien.
I’m glad it seems to work so well.	Jien ferħan li jidher li jaħdem daqshekk tajjeb.
It was so helpful.	Kien ta’ tant għajnuna.
I know this first.	Naf dan l-ewwel.
He couldn’t have said so.	Ma setax qal hekk.
But for me.	Imma għalija.
I had to know.	Kelli nkun naf.
Come on, give it a try.	Ejja, ipprova ftit.
I have a few problems already.	Għandi ftit problemi diġà.
If you could talk.	Kieku int tkun tista' titkellem.
I couldn’t believe she was going to do something like that.	Ma stajtx nemmen li kienet se tagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik.
This is what we can and should do today.	Dan huwa dak li nistgħu u għandna nagħmlu llum.
Now it has happened.	Issa ġara.
Nothing went wrong.	Xejn ma mar ħażin.
She had done enough.	Hija kienet għamlet biżżejjed.
Maybe until tomorrow or more.	Forsi sa għada jew aktar.
So do it.	Hekk tagħmel dan.
Do you think he might be interested ?.	Taħseb li jista' jkun interessat?.
It looked very good.	Deher tajjeb ħafna.
You have to come together.	Trid tiġi flimkien.
It's just there.	Huwa biss hemm.
I can't do anything alone.	Jien ma nista nagħmel xejn waħdi.
There is nothing more.	M'hemm xejn aktar.
Like you.	Bħal int.
There’s a lot this week.	Hemm ħafna din il-ġimgħa.
He will be fine.	Huwa se jkun tajjeb.
I couldn't see anyone.	Ma stajt nara lil ħadd.
Good for him if he goes.	Tajjeb għalih jekk imur.
You'll be fine enough.	Int tkun tajjeb biżżejjed.
I was able to stay home.	Stajt noqgħod id-dar.
You don't have to be here now.	M'għandekx għalfejn tkun hawn issa.
Nobody.	Ħadd.
It was too big.	Kien kbir wisq.
Sometimes she has to do it.	Xi drabi hi trid tagħmel dan.
Not much more I can take.	Mhux wisq aktar nista' nieħu.
This is not my job.	Dan mhux xogħol tiegħi.
But it is nothing.	Imma mhu xejn.
But that’s not the only problem.	Imma dik mhix l-unika problema.
That’s the one for you.	Dik hija dik għalik.
Me, you can tell.	Jien, tista’ tgħid.
Do you have any idea about this.	Għandek xi idea dwar dan.
He went back.	Huwa mar lura.
It can’t take enough.	Ma jistax jieħu biżżejjed.
This is what.	Dan huwa dak.
Good to see that.	Tajjeb li tara dan.
Only here, towards the end.	Hawn biss, lejn l-aħħar.
There we have it.	Hemmhekk għandna.
And he has friends.	U għandu ħbieb.
But she knew it was time.	Imma kienet taf li wasal iż-żmien.
I'm scared.	Jien nibża’.
I really like this job.	Jien inħobb ħafna dan ix-xogħol.
I want to talk about it.	Irrid nitkellem dwarha.
You can do as you please.	Tista' tagħmel kif trid.
I don’t know why this happened.	Ma nafx għaliex ġara dan.
He will not live to try again with anyone else.	Mhux se jgħix biex jerġa’ jipprova dan ma’ xi ħadd ieħor.
I had no coming.	ma kellix ġej.
Many, perhaps.	Ħafna, forsi.
Looks like it may have come out today.	Jidher li seta’ ħareġ illum.
And there it was.	U hemmhekk kienet.
Something else would be better than this.	Xi ħaġa oħra tkun aħjar minn dan.
Well, better than nothing.	Ukoll, aħjar minn xejn.
As he had said.	Hekk kif kien qal.
I'm your friend, forever.	Jien ħabib tiegħek, għal dejjem.
She knows you are watching.	Hija taf li qed tara.
Now we know.	Issa nafu.
Now is not our time.	Issa mhux iż-żmien tagħna.
We have a lot of such things.	Għandna ħafna affarijiet bħal dawn.
Now this one.	Issa dan wieħed.
He will be there but not seen.	Hu ser ikun hemm imma ma jidhirx.
But someone has to say these things.	Imma xi ħadd irid jgħid dawn l-affarijiet.
Everyone needs help.	Kulħadd jeħtieġ li jgħin.
He knew it was early, but he couldn't wait any longer.	Kien jaf li kien kmieni, imma ma setax jistenna aktar.
He wasn’t sure he wanted to.	Ma kienx ċert li ried.
That's what happened to me.	Hekk ġara lili.
She was not there.	Ma kinitx hemm.
This will happen.	Dan se jiġri.
This is what happens.	Dan huwa dak li jiġri.
And of course it wasn’t small.	U ovvjament ma kienx żgħir.
But it was good.	Imma kien tajjeb.
It took me a while to understand.	Dan ħa ftit biex nifhem.
I can’t just say when.	Ma nistax ngħid biss meta.
And she knew it.	U kienet taf.
I really have no idea what's going on.	Tassew m'għandi l-ebda idea x'qed jiġri.
And that soon.	U dak dalwaqt.
And he thinks.	U jaħseb.
Besides, she knew.	Barra minn hekk, kienet taf.
I can be anything.	Jien nista' nkun xi ħaġa.
Until this afternoon.	Sa llum wara nofsinhar.
Good man.	Raġel tajjeb.
It was too good for that.	Kien wisq tajjeb għal dan.
My good friend has this problem.	Ħabib tajjeb tiegħi għandu din il-problema.
Other times not.	Drabi oħra le.
I'm just going to go.	Jien se mmur biss.
I want you to do this for me.	Irrid li tagħmel dan għalija.
I'm going to do something.	Jien ser nagħmel xi ħaġa.
Ridt.	Ridt.
He was just a little boy.	Kien biss tifel żgħir.
We are more than that.	Aħna aktar minn hekk.
I just do and that’s it.	Nagħmel biss u dak hu hekk.
It really happened.	Ġara tassew.
I’m glad she did.	Jien ferħan li għamlet.
Most people.	Ħafna nies.
And many other people, too.	U ħafna nies oħra, ukoll.
I said no.	Għidt li mhux hekk.
And he looked again.	U ħares mill-ġdid.
It could be yours too.	Jista’ jkun tiegħek ukoll.
No one is just what you are to me.	Ħadd mhu biss dak li int għalija.
It doesn’t even have to be anything.	Lanqas ma jeħtieġ li tkun xi ħaġa.
Say nothing.	Tgħid xejn.
And that's good.	U dak tajjeb.
He did it with me.	Huwa għamel dan miegħi.
All right from me.	Kollox tajjeb minni.
It could be something or someone, and it could be after me.	Jista 'jkun xi ħaġa jew xi ħadd, u jista' jkun wara lili.
That went pretty fast.	Li mar pjuttost malajr.
Nothing was done.	Ma sar xejn.
I don’t say that to anyone.	Jien ma ngħid hekk lil ħadd.
He had done so before.	Huwa kien għamel hekk qabel.
But better than nothing.	Imma aħjar minn xejn.
It’s hard for you to see that.	Huwa diffiċli għalik li tara dan.
He was waiting and watching what happened in the morning.	Kien jistenna u jara x’ġara filgħodu.
But I’m not sure how I’m going to do it.	Imma m'inix ċert kif se nagħmel.
That and that only.	Dak u dak biss.
It seemed to go on and on.	Deher li sejjer u sejjer.
It can’t just take your home.	Hija ma tistax tieħu biss id-dar tiegħek.
Or don’t.	Jew ma tagħmilx.
I hope he doesn’t.	Nispera li ma jagħmilx hekk.
You think that, don't you.	Inti taħseb li, ma inti.
I said the sooner the better.	Jien għedt li aktar ma jkun kmieni aħjar.
After that you can do whatever you want.	Wara dan tista 'tagħmel dak kollu li trid.
Me and you.	Jien u int.
Nothing else was wrong.	Xejn aktar ma kien ħażin.
Not tomorrow.	Mhux għada.
That was what she did.	Dan kien dak li għamlet.
You don’t even need to think about it.	Lanqas ma għandek bżonn taħseb dwar dan.
Glad you're good.	Ferħan li int tajjeb.
Not now, he said.	Mhux issa, qal.
I saw it done.	Rajt isir.
That was living with me.	Dak kien qed jgħix miegħi.
That works well.	Dak li jaħdem tajjeb.
I’m glad I’m doing my job.	Jien kuntent li qed nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi.
No, neither is he.	Le, hu lanqas.
I'll tell you what really happened.	Jien ser ngħidlek x’ġara tassew.
It was more than he ever did.	Kien aktar milli qatt għamel.
It’s hard to really tell.	Huwa diffiċli li verament tgħid.
U se.	U se.
This will not do.	Dan mhux se jagħmel.
You know, we do a lot of good things.	Taf, aħna nagħmlu ħafna affarijiet tajjeb.
It’s nothing like that.	Mhu xejn bħal dan.
But you are right.	Imma għandek raġun.
Now this could be wrong.	Issa dan jista 'jkun ħażin.
Someone will do it but it doesn’t look like it will be us.	Xi ħadd se jagħmel dan imma ma jidhirx li se nkunu aħna.
You have to settle for that.	Trid toqgħod għal dan.
There is no other way to say it.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor biex tgħid dan.
Now he couldn't do anything right.	Issa ma seta’ jagħmel xejn tajjeb.
It's on quite a bit now.	Hija fuq pjuttost ftit issa.
This seems to work in fact.	Dan jidher li jaħdem fil-fatt.
And, for a while, he did too.	U, għal xi żmien, għamel ukoll.
They were.	Kienu huma.
That's it.	Dak hu.
He is not happy.	Hu mhux kuntent.
Try this.	Ipprova dan.
What he was not saying.	X'kien ma kienx jgħid.
I was glad I was there.	Kont kuntent li kont hemm.
Everyone came.	Kulħadd daħal.
Most people do this.	Ħafna nies jagħmlu dan.
And there he went.	U hemmhekk mar.
Not tomorrow either.	Mhux għada lanqas.
This is going well.	Dan sejjer tajjeb.
Not just for me.	Mhux għalija biss.
No, it wasn’t good.	Le, ma kienx tajjeb.
You don’t even think it’s good.	Lanqas taħseb li hu tajjeb.
He can wait.	Jista' jistenna.
That's the good thing.	Huwa dak tajjeb.
For how glad he is.	Għal kemm hu ferħan.
If it happens, it will be very fast.	Jekk jiġri, ikun malajr ħafna.
We have to go home.	Irridu mmorru d-dar.
Not that it probably would.	Mhux li x'aktarx kieku.
Or with us.	Jew magħna.
He could not see where he was going.	Ma setax jara fejn kien sejjer.
Everything is going well.	Kollox sejjer tajjeb.
He said so.	Huwa qal hekk.
Just something to think about.	Biss xi ħaġa li taħseb dwarha.
I can’t say why right now.	Ma nistax ngħid għaliex bħalissa.
Sure.	Żgur.
I knew he was right.	Kont naf li kellu raġun.
No, for a while.	Le, għal ftit.
But not today.	Imma mhux illum.
I can’t do that at all.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan għal kollox.
I didn’t really think about it.	Ma tantx ħsibt.
Not so much.	Mhux daqshekk.
But that’s not a big deal.	Imma dak mhux ħaġa kbira.
I don’t know where to go.	Jien ma nafx fejn immur.
Well, maybe actually right now.	Ukoll, forsi fil-fatt bħalissa.
She had my back.	Hija kellha lura tiegħi.
Before anyone knew we were here.	Qabel ma xi ħadd kien jaf konna hawn.
It is so now.	Huwa hekk issa.
There he was.	Hemmhekk kien.
We both want the same thing.	It-tnejn irridu l-istess ħaġa.
He was sure he had done it.	Kien ċert li kien għamel dan.
This, the only one.	Din, l-unika waħda.
Let’s go further.	Ejja mmorru aktar.
I did the same.	Jien għamilt l-istess.
Always, always, there was someone else out there.	Dejjem, dejjem, kien hemm xi ħadd ieħor hemmhekk.
He can't say anything.	Ma jkun jista’ jgħid xejn.
It's too late for that.	Huwa tard wisq għal dan.
I will be out for a while.	Inkun barra għal xi żmien.
It really helps.	Huwa tassew jgħin.
Today maybe not so.	Illum forsi mhux hekk.
You don’t have to do anything else.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
Things were so for him.	L-affarijiet kienu hekk għalih.
All that time.	Dak il-ħin kollu.
I saw it, now.	Rajt, issa.
It's not a job.	Mhuwiex xogħol.
The problem is this.	Il-problema hija din.
But you.	Imma int.
I’m not sure why you do that.	M'inix ċert għaliex tagħmel dan.
He never said so.	Qatt ma qal hekk.
I would.	Jien nixtieq.
Someone is talking to me.	Xi ħadd qed jitkellem miegħi.
Or was it.	Jew kien.
This is not much.	Dan mhux ħafna.
Or maybe it wasn’t.	Jew forsi ma kienx.
That was nothing.	Dan ma kien xejn.
But here’s something better.	Imma hawn xi ħaġa aħjar.
But he did not know.	Imma dan ma kienx jaf.
I have never seen such a thing.	Qatt ma ra ħaġa bħal din.
I'll go myself.	Jien ser immur jien.
He was a boy like that.	Kien tifel bħal dan.
And it seems to be working.	U jidher li qed jaħdem.
They felt happy.	Ħassu kuntent.
Is this money? 	Dawn huma flus?
And maybe they were.	U forsi kienu.
It's about.	Huwa dwar.
And it wasn’t so bad.	U ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
I usually have fun.	Normalment nieħu gost.
This is a lot.	Dan huwa ħafna.
I can do a little more.	Nista 'nagħmel ftit aktar.
He wasn’t going to think about it.	Ma kienx se jaħseb dwarha.
He did it.	Huwa għamel dan.
But it was good.	Imma kien tajjeb.
You just know.	Inti taf biss.
For many people, this is too easy.	Għal ħafna nies, dan huwa faċli wisq.
Not a big deal.	Mhix xi ħaġa kbira.
This is how it is done.	Dan huwa kif isir.
Now it seems to do.	Issa jidher li jagħmlu.
That’s school for me.	Dik hi l-iskola għalija.
Not that we don't have it.	Mhux li m’għandniex.
But not much.	Imma ma tantx.
In addition.	Barra minn hekk.
It’s good after that.	Huwa tajjeb wara dak.
The last few years.	L-aħħar ftit snin.
As it should.	Kif għandu.
She will be scared.	Hija ser tkun jibża.
Not that it says so.	Mhux li jgħid hekk.
It's about something.	Huwa fuq xi ħaġa.
This was not going to be easy.	Dan ma kienx se jkun faċli.
That won't work.	Li mhux se jaħdem.
Nobody around.	Ħadd madwar.
I know a lot of people back home so.	Naf ħafna nies lura d-dar hekk.
Nothing happened.	Ma ġara xejn.
It should not be running fast.	M'għandux ikun qed jaħdem malajr.
It's just wrong.	Huwa biss ħażin.
Don't do it.	Ma tagħmel.
Maybe she did.	Forsi hi għamlet.
He wasn’t the only one either.	Ma kienx l-uniku wieħed lanqas.
He was trying.	Kien jipprova.
That comes fast enough.	Dak jiġi malajr biżżejjed.
This is the only one.	Dan huwa l-uniku wieħed.
It may just be like this.	Jista 'jkun biss bħal dan.
This will do.	Dan se jagħmel.
He knew it was good for us before we did.	Kien jaf li kien tajjeb għalina qabel ma għamilna.
But you never knew.	Imma qatt ma kont taf.
But it was the only way.	Imma kien l-uniku mod.
Sure.	Żgur.
I think everything you say is good.	Naħseb li dak kollu li tgħid huwa tajjeb.
I have never seen this before.	Qatt ma rajt dan qabel.
Nothing so great.	Xejn daqshekk kbir.
We did it often.	Għamilna spiss.
She had to do this years ago.	Hija kellha tagħmel dan snin ilu.
It wasn’t work.	Ma kienx xogħol.
It will never happen.	Qatt mhu se jiġri.
She can do it.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan.
But that was the last thing I could do for him.	Imma dik kienet l-aħħar ħaġa li stajt nagħmel għalih.
Same for him.	L-istess għalih.
This is what will happen.	Dan huwa dak li se jiġri.
And there you are.	U hemm int.
This may work.	Dan jista 'jaħdem.
Now he has to.	Issa għandu.
We have to go.	Irridu mmorru.
I didn’t know, maybe she was right, maybe she knew something.	Ma kontx naf, forsi kellha raġun, forsi kienet taf xi ħaġa.
I don’t want to go.	Ma rridx immur.
But that was the first time it had happened.	Imma dik kienet l-ewwel darba li ġara.
You just have to tell me now.	Int għandek biss tgħidli issa.
But she was going to do it.	Imma kienet se tagħmel dan.
It's just you and me.	Huwa biss int u jien.
Well, not really, no.	Ukoll, mhux verament, le.
Go fast.	Tmur malajr.
I wasn’t interested in doing that.	Ma kontx interessat li nagħmel dan.
But no.	Imma le.
He never had.	Hu qatt ma kellu.
What is mine is his.	Dak li hu tiegħi huwa tiegħu.
Well, that's for me.	Ukoll, dak huwa għalija.
It's so obviously wrong.	Huwa hekk ovvjament ħażin.
She is so beautiful.	Hija tant sabiħa.
I know he’s just a person.	Naf li hu biss persuna.
I think he’s happy.	Naħseb li hu kuntent.
I had little money.	Kelli ftit flus.
I want to be tired, he thought.	Irrid inkun għajjien, ħaseb.
He did not want to eat.	Ma riedx jiekol.
It was really not bad as it looked.	Kien verament mhux ħażin kif deher.
No help yet.	Għadu l-ebda għajnuna.
That's just who he is.	Dak hu biss min hu.
We will do that.	Aħna se nagħmlu dan.
And there are problems with that.	U hemm problemi b'dan.
She can't do it again.	Hija ma tistax tagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
Well, she had done it.	Ukoll, hija kienet għamlet dan.
I never thought of you.	Qatt ma ħsibt li inti.
She is as good as everyone else.	Hija tajba daqs kulħadd.
Who knows, it could happen.	Min jaf, jista’ jiġri.
Why why why why.	Għaliex għaliex għaliex għaliex.
This is not what happened.	Dan mhux dak li ġara.
Nothing like this has ever happened.	Xejn bħal dan qatt ma ġara.
You don’t need to talk about it now.	M'għandekx bżonn titkellem dwarha issa.
I did and I do.	Għamilt u nagħmel.
Which is actually a good thing.	Li fil-fatt hija ħaġa tajba.
That seems to be happening now.	Li jidher li jiġri issa.
It was working well a while ago.	Kien qed jaħdem tajjeb ftit ilu.
This was not the case.	Dan ma kienx hekk.
Good with me.	Tajjeb miegħi.
He said you know about it.	Huwa qal li inti taf dwar dan.
Not too much.	Mhux wisq.
I was doing something.	Jien kont nagħmel xi ħaġa.
She was going to do it.	Kienet se tagħmel dan.
Like what happened.	Bħal dak li ġara.
Nothing can ever be easier.	Xejn qatt ma jista 'jkun daqshekk faċli.
Definitely a big problem.	Żgur problema kbira.
It’s that you don’t have to be.	Huwa li m'għandekx għalfejn tkun.
How are you.	Kif inti.
There is only one way to do this.	Hemm mod wieħed biss biex tagħmel dan.
Let's go home very soon.	Ejja mmorru d-dar malajr ħafna.
I don’t know enough.	Ma nafx biżżejjed.
Good.	Tajjeb.
I’ll want to know why.	Jien ser irrid inkun naf għaliex.
Not so with me.	Mhux hekk miegħi.
Maybe we are both right.	Forsi għandna raġun it-tnejn.
I heard and heard.	Smajt u smajt.
They were there before.	Kienu hemm qabel.
I know that’s not enough.	Naf li mhux biżżejjed.
She didn't know.	Hija ma kinitx taf.
And no one ever does that.	U ħadd qatt ma jagħmel dan.
You're the last.	Int l-aħħar.
I also like to do things.	Inħobb ukoll nagħmel l-affarijiet.
She really knew what he was thinking.	Kienet tassew taf x’kien qed jaħseb.
He wants the truth.	Irid il-verità.
But nothing bad has happened yet.	Imma għadu ma ġara xejn ħażin.
It all comes later.	Dan kollu jiġi aktar tard.
I thought everything was fine.	Ħsibt li kollox kien tajjeb.
It was something like what happened today.	Kien xi ħaġa bħal dak li ġara llum.
She would be good on her own.	Hija tkun tajba waħedha.
This was something he never knew.	Din kienet xi ħaġa li qatt ma kien jaf.
It works there too.	Jaħdem hemm ukoll.
He had passed.	Huwa kien għadda.
I didn’t know I was here.	Ma kontx naf li kont qiegħed hawn.
Everything went well.	Kollox mar tajjeb.
It won’t be the first time.	Ma tkunx l-ewwel darba.
I didn’t like talking about such things.	Ma kontx inħobb nitkellem dwar affarijiet bħal dawn.
Now he needs to have a little more of these.	Issa jeħtieġ li jkollu ftit aktar minn dawn.
Everything would be fine.	Kollox ikun tajjeb.
Nothing happened.	Ma ġara xejn.
We are always already friends.	Aħna dejjem diġà ħbieb.
He would be.	Hu jkun.
Maybe someday.	Forsi xi darba.
He had no idea where he was going.	Ma kellux idea fejn kien sejjer.
I’m not a bad boy.	Jien mhux tifel ħażin.
Just still not alone.	Biss għadu mhux biss.
Most of all, he didn’t want to go back.	Aktar minn kollox, ma riedx lura.
But not.	Imma mhux.
Not after today.	Mhux wara llum.
It's a little small.	Huwa ftit żgħir.
Or about so many other things.	Jew dwar tant affarijiet oħra.
She never had to.	Hija qatt ma kellha.
Not too late.	Mhux tard wisq.
But they have to.	Imma għandhom.
he said.	hu qal.
I hope someone helps.	Nispera li xi ħadd jgħin.
But we had a great time.	Imma kellna ħafna ħin.
Not a bit either.	Mhux daqsxejn lanqas.
He wants to talk to you.	Irid jitkellem miegħek.
He could leave now, if he wanted to.	Huwa jista 'jitlaq issa, jekk ried.
I want to be helpful.	Irrid inkun ta' għajnuna.
This is why.	Dan hu għaliex.
That’s how we do things.	Hekk nagħmlu l-affarijiet.
That will be long.	Dak se jkun twil.
How about that.	Kif dwar dan.
But not just now.	Imma mhux issa biss.
I want to do better.	Irrid nagħmel aħjar.
But there should be no more than that.	Imma m'għandux ikun hemm aktar minn hekk.
It’s not happening right now.	Mhux qed jiġri bħalissa.
There was nothing.	Ma kien hemm xejn.
Maybe so, but not fast enough for me.	Forsi hekk, imma mhux malajr biżżejjed għalija.
I want to be both.	Irrid inkun it-tnejn.
Please don't be late.	Jekk jogħġbok ma tkun tard.
There is nothing where to go in the afternoon.	M'hemm xejn fejn tmur wara nofsinhar.
We are not just our job !.	Aħna mhux biss ix-xogħol tagħna!.
For take and take and take.	Għal jieħu u jieħu u jieħu.
That's just it.	Hekk hu biss.
Not after what he had just seen.	Mhux wara dak li kien għadu kemm ra.
That was not going to happen.	Li ma kienx se jiġri.
Whatever it is, he will win.	Ikun xi jkun, hu se jirbaħ.
Everything I am.	Kollox jien.
It’s not very good for anything else.	Mhuwiex tajjeb ħafna għal xi ħaġa oħra.
You have to take everyone with you.	Int trid tieħu lil kulħadd miegħek.
This was just before he died.	Dan kien eżatt qabel miet.
I'm happy for you.	Jien kuntent għalik.
But that doesn’t seem to work.	Imma dan ma jidhirx li jaħdem.
That’s not too bad.	Dak mhux ħażin wisq.
This is really good.	Dan huwa tassew tajjeb.
It does a good job.	Jagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
In fact, it looks just like it was before.	Fil-fatt jidher eżatt bħal ma kien qabel.
I see no problem.	Ma nara l-ebda problema.
There is only one way.	Hemm mod wieħed biss.
It should be hard to see.	Għandu jkun diffiċli biex tara.
That was my problem.	Dik kienet il-problema tiegħi.
I listened to everything.	Kont nisma’ kollox.
This is a great thing.	Din hija ħaġa kbira.
But it doesn’t do that either.	Imma dan ma jagħmel lanqas.
That's it.	Dak hu.
Nothing can help.	Xejn jista 'jgħin.
She did what she said.	Hija għamlet dak li qal.
I can't believe it.	Ma nistax nemmen.
I wonder if you were happy, if you are happy now.	Nistaqsi jekk kontx kuntent, jekk int kuntent issa.
I hope this was helpful.	Nittama li dan kien ta' għajnuna.
I’m not talking to him.	Jien mhux qed nitkellem miegħu.
She was not sitting down.	Hija ma kinitx toqgħod bilqiegħda.
I believe there is more out there.	Nemmen li hemm aktar hemmhekk.
This doesn’t have to be a problem.	Dan m'għandux għalfejn ikun problema.
I heard that.	Smajt dan.
She would never do any of that.	Hija qatt ma kienet tagħmel xejn minn hekk.
It’s just a thing with me.	Huwa biss ħaġa miegħi.
But that hadn’t happened either.	Imma dan ma kienx ġara lanqas.
Come and go.	Jiġi u jmur.
It just seems.	Jidher biss.
This also works well.	Dan ukoll jaħdem tajjeb.
He, he said.	Huwa, huwa qal.
And there you have it.	U hemm għandek.
I wanted to see more.	Ridt nara aktar.
But to be there.	Imma li jkun hemm.
I really don't want to.	Verament ma rridx.
No one ever goes there.	Ħadd qatt ma jmur hemm.
But they are not.	Imma mhux huma.
And it should.	U għandu.
Let's go home.	Ejja lejn id-dar.
It could be better.	Jista 'jkun aħjar.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwar dan.
But he did.	Imma hekk għamel.
About both, in fact.	Dwar it-tnejn, fil-fatt.
Maybe nothing.	Forsi xejn.
And you can't either.	U tista' lanqas.
This is a very good saying.	Dan huwa qal tajjeb ħafna.
I'll be quick.	Inkun malajr.
Well we did.	Ukoll għamilna.
This does not do good.	Dan ma jagħmilx tajjeb.
But it wasn’t that easy.	Imma ma kienx daqshekk faċli.
She was back.	Kienet lura.
How it will go on.	Kif se jmur fuq.
Or, more likely, not.	Jew, aktar probabbli, le.
Very soon now, someone will.	Dalwaqt ħafna issa, xi ħadd se.
He made money.	Huwa għamel flus.
I really need to do that.	Għandi bżonn tassew li nagħmel dan.
Still no idea.	Għadu l-ebda idea.
He had no other friends.	Ma kellu l-ebda ħbieb oħra.
But not tonight.	Imma mhux illejla.
But it’s still a problem.	Imma għadha problema.
To know each other a little.	Biex nafu ftit lil xulxin.
Pretty sure you will too.	Pjuttost żgur li int se tkun ukoll.
It doesn't look good.	Ma jidhirx tajjeb.
Someone was going to play.	Xi ħadd kien se jilgħab.
Often, much more.	Ħafna drabi, ħafna aktar.
Look around your house.	Ħares madwar id-dar tiegħek.
It's quite a thing.	Huwa pjuttost ħaġa.
He couldn't quite.	Huwa ma setax pjuttost.
Everything came out nothing.	Kollox ħareġ xejn.
And how long it would take.	U kemm kien se jieħu.
He is happy to be with us.	Hu kuntent li jibqa’ magħna.
I had seen enough.	Jien kont rajt biżżejjed.
I'm home.	Jien id-dar.
It was so easy.	Kien daqshekk faċli.
But I don’t know why, but it’s not working.	Imma ma nafx għaliex, imma mhux qed jaħdem.
He never did and never will.	Qatt ma għamel u qatt ma se.
It has everything you need and more.	Għandu dak kollu li għandek bżonn u aktar.
All our work, ready.	Ix-xogħol tagħna kollu, lest.
We did pretty well.	Għamilna pjuttost tajjeb.
Not for you either.	Lanqas għalik.
Too little, too late.	Ftit wisq, tard wisq.
That's how it started.	Hekk beda.
You are so sorry for me.	Inti tant jiddispjaċini għalija.
She never did that.	Hija qatt ma għamlet dan.
It's all ours.	Huwa tagħna kollha.
We are your friends.	Aħna ħbieb tiegħek.
Harder to do that now.	Aktar diffiċli li tagħmel dan issa.
He said they are.	Qal li huma.
It’s just not his home.	Huwa biss mhux id-dar tiegħu.
You are with me.	Int miegħi.
But we are better than that now.	Imma aħna aħjar minn hekk issa.
I see you're ready from here.	Nara li int lest minn hawn.
But there is another.	Imma hemm ieħor.
Not much.	Mhux ħafna.
He and I, we are friends.	Hu u jien, aħna ħbieb.
I am none of these things.	Jiena xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet.
No one was sure what was happening.	Ħadd ma kien ċert x’kien qed jiġri.
It's almost like his.	Huwa kważi bħal tiegħu.
No one is coming for you.	Ħadd mhu ġej għalik.
That came first, he thought.	Li ġie l-ewwel, ħaseb.
That's one thing.	Dik hija ħaġa waħda.
Just this and here and now.	Dan biss u hawn u issa.
Quick and easy !.	Malajr u faċli!.
It only happened once.	Ġara darba biss.
I did these a while ago.	Għamilt dawn ftit żmien ilu.
She left a few hours ago.	Telaq ftit sigħat ilu.
This is good to see.	Dan huwa tajjeb biex tara.
I saw it happen.	Rajt jiġri.
I had enough.	Kelli biżżejjed.
Everything very much.	Kollox ħafna.
It wasn't just me.	Ma kontx jien biss.
We are both the same.	Aħna t-tnejn l-istess.
Too small, too big.	Żgħir wisq, kbir wisq.
There was just a do.	Kien hemm biss tagħmel.
I can never see anything.	Qatt nista' nara xejn.
But they were things he loved.	Imma kienu affarijiet li kien iħobb.
But not from this.	Imma mhux minn dan.
Why not be the first ?.	Għaliex ma tkunx l-ewwel?.
You don't want to.	Inti ma tridx.
We always know that we are someone.	Dejjem nafu li aħna xi ħadd.
I didn’t say anything to anyone.	Jien ma għedt xejn lil ħadd.
I know a few people who have me.	Naf ftit nies li għandhom jien.
It works on its own.	Jaħdem waħdu.
A little bit.	Ftit ftit.
I expect someone else to do the same.	Nistenna li xi ħadd ieħor jagħmel l-istess.
Never do that.	Qatt tagħmel dan.
Now that would be something.	Issa dik kienet tkun xi ħaġa.
No, come on, come on.	Le, ejja, ejja.
It can work that way.	Jista 'jaħdem hekk.
It was so for him.	Kien hekk għalih.
? 	?
I know exactly where I'm going with this.	Naf eżatt fejn sejjer b'dan.
But only.	Imma biss.
You stay here.	Inti toqgħod hawn.
She is very beautiful and good.	Hija sabiħa ħafna u tajba.
Years ago, he thought, when he was a child.	Snin ilu, ħaseb, meta kien tifel.
I take it that way too.	Jien nieħu hekk ukoll.
I'll tell you about it.	Jien ngħidlek dwarha.
Not here, nor there.	Mhux hawn, u lanqas hemm.
He will be back.	Hu se jkun lura.
It's been a long time.	Kien ilu żmien twil.
You don’t need to do anything to make this work.	M'għandekx bżonn tagħmel xejn biex dan jaħdem.
Or she.	Jew hi.
We knew each other so well.	Konna nafu lil xulxin daqshekk tajjeb.
It was the same today.	Kien l-istess illum.
I think it’s both.	Naħseb li hu t-tnejn.
It was working late.	Kien jaħdem tard.
It was a good idea.	Kienet idea tajba.
This was easy for me.	Dan kien faċli għalija.
But actually a lot of people are with me, not with you.	Imma fil-fatt ħafna nies huma miegħi, mhux miegħek.
I think you are not well.	Naħseb li m'intix tajjeb.
And that was what it was.	U dan kien dak li kienet.
How about that ?.	Kif dwar dak?.
Now or never, he thought.	Issa jew qatt, ħaseb.
I know nothing.	Jien ma naf xejn.
There is something else, too.	Hemm xi ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
Just to see how she is.	Biss biex tara kif hi.
Definitely wouldn’t.	Żgur li ma kienx se.
Maybe not so good.	Forsi mhux daqshekk tajjeb.
I can see it again, now.	Nista’ nerġa’ nara, issa.
That’s the first thing to say.	Dik hija l-ewwel ħaġa li għandek tgħid.
I have to wait a little longer.	Għandi nistenna għal ftit aktar ħin.
But hard, boy.	Imma diffiċli, tifel.
Don't do it !.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan!.
She was who she was.	Kienet min kienet.
These are mine.	Dawn huma tiegħi.
I had no idea where to go.	Ma kellix idea fejn immur.
I would say we are the first.	Jien ngħid li aħna l-ewwel.
Why does this happen.	Għaliex jiġri hekk.
That I was here.	Li kont hawn.
You do a lot on your own.	Inti tagħmel ħafna waħdek.
Everything was done quickly.	Kollox sar malajr.
I have you.	Għandi inti.
He will see that you are with me.	Hu ser jara li int miegħi.
Surely he knew the truth, if he knew anyone.	Żgur li kien jaf il-verità, jekk kien jaf xi ħadd.
There was no one who could talk about these things.	Ma kien hemm ħadd li tista’ titkellem dwar dawn l-affarijiet.
Both are nothing good.	It-tnejn li huma xejn tajba.
Well, he thought.	Ukoll, ħaseb.
And she was there.	U hi kienet hemm.
I only have this.	Għandi dan biss.
I get what you say.	Ikolli dak li tgħid.
He is here too.	Hu hawn ukoll.
This happens more than you think.	Dan jiġri aktar milli taħseb.
But, you are right.	Imma, għandek raġun.
Just as he said he would.	Hekk kif qal li se.
You want it to be for you.	Trid li tkun għalik.
And he was right.	U kellu raġun.
And, well, that's probably why.	U, ukoll, dan għaliex probabbilment kien.
It works well now.	Jaħdem tajjeb issa.
But not good.	Imma mhux tajjeb.
I don’t know why.	Ma nafx għaliex.
They were just.	Kienu biss.
Like this and that.	Bħal dan u dan.
What I said.	Dak li għidt.
This was not to happen.	Dan ma kellux jiġri.
He is better than us.	Hu aħjar milli aħna.
I didn't see anything.	Jien ma rajt xejn.
How.	Kif .
He loved to happen, work.	Kien iħobb jiġri, jaħdem.
And so are we.	U hekk aħna.
Now.	Issa .
I believe you think this happened.	Nemmen li taħseb li dan ġara.
But it’s not working that way.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem hekk.
She will go back to school.	Hija se tmur lura l-iskola.
Nobody, he said.	Ħadd, qal.
But this was home.	Imma din kienet id-dar.
From a friend.	Minn ħabib.
It was too big for him.	Kien kbir wisq għalih.
Only, no time.	Biss, l-ebda ħin.
Where are you.	Fejn int.
Everything is going well.	Kollox sejjer tajjeb.
I had done something wrong.	Kont għamilt xi ħaġa ħażina.
I hope all is well.	Nittama li kollox tajjeb.
I don’t think of anything at a time.	Ma naħsibx xejn fi żmien.
I'm sorry not only.	Jiddispjaċini li mhux biss.
But it wasn't.	Imma ma kienx.
But soon you will be home.	Imma dalwaqt tkun id-dar.
It will never happen.	Qatt mhu se jiġri.
Next week fast enough.	Il-ġimgħa d-dieħla malajr biżżejjed.
Obviously not just you.	Ovvjament mhux int biss.
You will speak.	Inti se titkellem.
What was coming next? 	X'kien ġej issa?
I hear what you want.	Nisma dak li trid.
Not about that.	Mhux dwar dan.
It was great for me.	Kien kbir għalija.
You must be a big boy, now.	Trid tkun tifel kbir, issa.
Obviously there are better people.	Ovvjament hemm nies aħjar.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
It's after that.	Huwa wara dan.
John was not there.	John ma kienx hemm.
Or someone else.	Jew xi ħadd ieħor.
This may not be for everyone.	Dan hekk kif jista’ ma jkunx għal kulħadd.
Most people do.	Ħafna nies jagħmlu.
No one should think so.	Ħadd ma għandu jaħseb hekk.
I was quite surprised.	Kont pjuttost sorpriż.
It will be difficult.	Se jkun diffiċli.
It was the first.	Kien l-ewwel.
I can't hear anything.	Ma nista’ nisma’ xejn.
That’s not a bad thing.	Dik mhix xi ħaġa ħażina.
I think he had.	Naħseb li kellu.
You can’t go wrong with either.	Ma tistax tmur ħażin ma' lanqas.
Above here.	Fuq hawn.
It was just an idea.	Kienet biss idea.
He's just a man.	Huwa biss raġel.
But probably not.	Imma probabbilment le.
I can’t sit back and do nothing.	Ma nistax noqgħod lura u ma nagħmel xejn.
You don't need to.	M'għandekx bżonn.
I really don’t want to talk about it.	Verament ma rridx nitkellem dwarha.
Not yet and maybe never.	Għadha mhux u forsi qatt.
That was good to know.	Dan kien tajjeb li tkun taf.
He was trying again.	Kien jerġa' jipprova.
Int.	Int .
Never again.	Qatt mhu aktar.
You had it all.	Kellek kollox.
I did what I did for you.	Għamilt dak li għamilt għalik.
She was someone.	Kienet xi ħadd.
This was actually happening.	Dan fil-fatt kien qed jiġri.
He has been.	Huwa ġie.
He got there early.	Wasal hemm kmieni.
It was.	Kien.
Maybe she didn't.	Forsi hi ma.
THE LAST	L-AĦĦAR
Where it should be.	Fejn kellha tkun.
I think it’s great that you have a lot of money.	Naħseb li huwa kbir li għandek ħafna flus.
He was a good man, by all means.	Kien raġel tajjeb, minn kollox.
It was too late.	Kien tard wisq.
He could have said.	Huwa seta 'qal.
Don’t think about it.	Ma jaħsibx dwarha.
It can be great.	Huwa jista 'jkun kbir.
What happened next, and what happened next, you want to know.	X'ġara wara, u x'ġara wara, trid tkun taf.
Definitely my stuff.	Żgur li kienu l-affarijiet tiegħi.
I have never seen anything more beautiful.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa aktar sabiħa.
This has happened many times.	Dan ġara ħafna drabi.
But that would be too soon.	Imma dan ikun malajr wisq.
I have no problem with that.	M'għandi l-ebda problema b'dan.
I see that.	Jiena nara li.
There is little more than that.	Hemm ftit aktar minn hekk.
It's really easy to do.	Huwa verament faċli li tagħmel.
Stay out.	Jibqa' barra.
And so we will do today.	U hekk se nagħmlu llum.
She didn't know.	Hija ma kinitx taf.
He can't, really.	Huwa ma jistax, verament.
I have to go.	Jien għandi mmur.
Well, maybe a few problems.	Ukoll, forsi ftit problemi.
This was one man.	Dan kien raġel wieħed.
This is just really hard.	Dan huwa biss verament diffiċli.
You know how that was.	Taf kif kien dak.
I’m sure of it now.	Jien ċert minn dan issa.
do, do.	tagħmel, tagħmel.
I can say that something was.	Nista 'ngħid li xi ħaġa kienet.
He wanted what she had.	Ried dak li kellha.
I would like some help.	Nixtieq xi għajnuna.
There was no one else to do it.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor biex jagħmel dan.
I think they are both right.	Naħseb li fil-fatt it-tnejn għandhom raġun.
But we may never know.	Imma forsi qatt ma nkunu nafu.
Not very long.	Mhux twil ħafna.
It happened before.	Ġara qabel.
For me it is a good thing.	Għalija hija ħaġa tajba.
And he seems to have been right.	U jidher li kellu raġun.
We knew what was going on.	Konna nafu x’qed jiġri.
It was as he had said.	Kien kif kien qal.
He wanted nothing.	Ried għal xejn.
It wasn't long in coming.	Ma kienx twil ġej.
And with him.	U miegħu.
Now you are ready.	Issa inti lest.
Well, maybe we do.	Ukoll, forsi nagħmlu.
Not back here.	Mhux lura hawn.
It was a good thing to do.	Kienet xi ħaġa tajba li tagħmel.
How beautiful it looks.	Kemm tidher sabiħa.
None of this happened.	Xejn minn dan ma ġara.
You know, that was it at the time.	Taf, hekk kien dak iż-żmien.
We are never really here.	Aħna qatt ma verament hawn.
I say I was with him.	Jien ngħid li kont miegħu.
This is not.	Dan mhux.
He lives here.	Jgħix hawn.
Well, it wasn’t that great.	Ukoll, ma kienx daqshekk kbir.
If he had, it was too bad.	Jekk kellu, kien ħażin wisq.
She wants to be out of this house.	Hija trid tkun barra minn din id-dar.
After that there will be no more.	Wara mhux se jkun hemm aktar.
This is as follows.	Dan huwa kif ġej.
He just wanted to go home.	Ried biss imur id-dar.
He never had and never will.	Qatt ma kellu u qatt mhu se.
This can go a long way.	Dan jista 'jmur kbir.
Bad idea.	Idea ħażina.
But he wants a boy.	Imma jrid tifel.
I told who.	Jien għedt ma’ min.
Maybe it won't.	Forsi mhux se.
This is one.	Dan huwa wieħed.
Everything was happening too fast.	Kollox kien qed jiġri wisq malajr.
I didn’t want to do this alone.	Ma ridtx nagħmel dan waħdi.
Just what it is.	Biss dak li hu.
Like they are capable.	Bħal huma kapaċi.
Which is where it goes wrong.	Li hu fejn tmur ħażin.
I also came here to think.	Jien ukoll ġejt hawn biex naħseb.
I really couldn’t believe it.	Verament ma stajtx nemmen.
As far as I know, there is only one.	Sa fejn naf jien, hemm wieħed biss.
He had gone through a lot.	Kien għadda minn ħafna.
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
Maybe you do and you won’t tell.	Forsi tagħmel u mhux se tgħid.
Or say no.	Jew għid le.
Things are easy.	L-affarijiet huma faċli.
I saw you do it.	Rajt inti tagħmel dan.
Maybe, he thought.	Jista ', ħaseb.
The evening was a little harder.	Filgħaxija kienet ftit aktar diffiċli.
I was a little surprised.	Kont xi ftit sorpriż.
But we can if you need.	Imma nistgħu jekk għandek bżonn.
I would be a good boy.	Inkun tifel tajjeb.
He had to be here.	Kellu jkun hawn.
One problem, I thought.	Problema waħda, ħsibt.
We knew we were on to something.	Konna nafu li konna fuq xi ħaġa.
It must have passed.	Għandu jkun għadda.
I'll tell you what you're thinking.	Jien ngħidlek x'qed taħseb.
It sure is happening.	Huwa żgur li qed jiġri.
I thought about things.	Ħsibt dwar l-affarijiet.
He will be here soon.	Huwa ser ikun hawn dalwaqt.
There seemed to be a little bit of everything.	Deher li kien hemm ftit minn kollox.
Someone needs to do this for him.	Jeħtieġ li xi ħadd jagħmel dan għalih.
All yours.	Tiegħek kollu.
That would be another.	Dak ikun ieħor.
Well it's back.	Ukoll huwa lura.
But this is it.	Imma dan hu.
I knew this well.	Dan kont naf tajjeb.
None of this was good.	Xejn minn dan ma kien tajjeb.
It's not for you to do as you please.	Hu mhux għalik biex tagħmel kif jekk jogħġbok.
I have no idea what it is.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'inhu.
I said maybe.	għidt forsi.
Tom would be glad to have him along.	Tom ikun ferħan li jkollu miegħu flimkien.
Everyone knew this.	Kulħadd kien jaf dan.
Many.	Ħafna.
But too late.	Imma tard wisq.
That was a good thing.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
It’s much, much harder to actually do that.	Huwa ħafna, ħafna aktar diffiċli li fil-fatt tagħmel dan.
She thinks this is a good thing.	Hija taħseb li din hija ħaġa tajba.
Without each other.	Mingħajr xulxin.
Really long time.	Żmien tassew twil.
She wants to go.	Hija trid tmur.
Maybe tomorrow evening.	Forsi għada filgħaxija.
It's pretty much better.	Huwa pjuttost aħjar.
But it wasn’t working.	Imma ma kienx qed jaħdem.
So much time.	Tant ħin.
Something had been wrong all this time.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħassu ħażin dan iż-żmien kollu.
He was not saying anything.	Ma kien qed jgħid xejn.
There were too many people.	Kien hemm wisq nies.
It was pretty easy to do.	Kien pjuttost faċli li tagħmel.
He did so quickly.	Hekk għamel malajr.
He was speaking today.	Kien jitkellem illum.
I was ready for it.	Jien kont lest għal dan.
So it was for me.	Hekk kien għalija.
I can't go any further.	Ma nistax immur aktar.
It looks like you.	Jidher li int.
I needed to think about it.	Kelli bżonn naħseb dwar dan.
Nor was he worried to appear.	Lanqas ma kien inkwetat li jidher.
He wants to try something.	Irid jipprova xi ħaġa.
It gets better and better.	Jagħmel aħjar u aħjar.
I will be there.	Jien se nkun hemm.
More than if it were there.	Aktar milli kieku hemm.
I don’t even know why.	Lanqas naf għaliex.
I didn’t know any of this.	Jien ma kont naf xejn minn dan.
Nothing for you right now.	Xejn għalik bħalissa.
If only for a while.	Jekk biss għal żmien.
He never wanted to do that again.	Qatt ma ried jerġa’ jagħmel hekk.
You want to take someone with you.	Trid tieħu lil xi ħadd miegħek.
And once on.	U darba fuq .
Work will wait.	Ix-xogħol se jistenna.
He wants to try to make things better for everyone.	Irid jipprova jagħmel l-affarijiet aħjar għal kulħadd.
I thought it would be better.	Ħsibt li jkun aħjar.
There is more to it than meets the eye.	Hemm aktar milli jidher.
I definitely hope he does.	Żgur nittama li jagħmel.
I will have to think about this later.	Ikolli naħseb dwar dan aktar tard.
This works and works very well.	Dan jaħdem u jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
It was a really difficult time for me.	Kien żmien tassew diffiċli għalija.
I really am.	Jien tassew.
I think that was it.	Naħseb li dan kien.
There you are, you see.	Hemm int, tara.
Always, never, never.	Dejjem, qatt, qatt.
I'll do it again.	Jien nerġa' nagħmel.
It goes on and on and on.	Imur fuq u fuq u fuq.
Come on, come on.	Ejja, ejja.
Since then.	Minn dak iż-żmien.
I had never thought of this before.	Qatt ma ħsibt dan qabel.
Not tomorrow, not next week, but today.	Mhux għada, mhux il-ġimgħa d-dieħla, imma llum.
He will not live that way.	Hu mhux se jgħix hekk.
Now, it won't.	Issa, mhux se.
You would if you could.	Inti kieku inti tista '.
This is my first problem.	Din hija l-ewwel problema tiegħi.
It can do so much better than that.	Hija tista 'tagħmel ħafna aħjar minn hekk.
It's very big.	Huwa kbir ħafna.
But it wasn’t really that late.	Imma ma kienx verament daqshekk tard.
It was right, of course.	Kien kif suppost, ovvjament.
And why it so often goes wrong.	U għaliex hekk spiss tmur ħażin.
And you can do that, too.	U tista 'tagħmel dan, ukoll.
Another man plays.	Raġel ieħor jilgħab.
It actually works.	Fil-fatt jaħdem.
I didn't really know what to say.	Ma kontx verament naf x’se ngħid.
I’m not just doing this.	Jien mhux biss qed nagħmel dan.
But no one knows what happened next.	Imma x’ġara wara ħadd ma jaf.
I do this over and over.	Nagħmel dan aktar u aktar.
She probably wasn't.	Hija probabbilment ma kinitx.
With another man.	Ma’ raġel ieħor.
You are eating together.	Qed tiekol flimkien.
Neither do I.	Jien lanqas.
It wasn’t hard.	Ma kienx diffiċli.
Glad to know it went well.	Ferħan li tkun taf li mar tajjeb.
But now there was no time.	Imma issa ma kienx hemm ħin.
It's too big.	Huwa kbir wisq.
I know the truth.	Naf il-verità.
It’s not going so well.	Mhux sejjer daqshekk tajjeb.
And as soon as he came, he left.	U malajr kif ġie, telaq.
Some other time, she says.	Xi żmien ieħor, tgħid.
If it doesn’t do a good job.	Jekk ma jagħmilx xogħol tajjeb.
You seem to have this more than a lot.	Jidher li għandek dan aktar minn ħafna.
That was me, now.	Dak kont jien, issa.
I was ready.	Kont lest.
It works like this.	Jaħdem bħal dan.
He became leaving.	Huwa sar jitlaq.
What are you ?.	Dak int?.
And he was happy.	U kien kuntent.
It didn’t look so good to me.	Ma deherx daqshekk tajjeb għalija.
And, he knew he had to do it fast.	U, kien jaf li kellu jagħmel dan malajr.
Plays well.	Jilgħab tajjeb.
Quick, please.	Malajr, jekk jogħġbok.
You are not ready.	M'intix lest.
I was good enough.	Kont tajjeb biżżejjed.
Which are many.	Li huma ħafna.
He had fun.	Huwa ħa gost.
One and only.	Wieħed u biss.
There are a lot of people, too.	Hemm ħafna nies, ukoll.
He had wanted out.	Huwa kien ried barra.
Now there was always something on.	Issa dejjem kien hemm xi ħaġa fuq.
They are with me.	Huma miegħi.
I can't believe it.	Ma nistax nemmen.
So much has happened.	Tant ġara.
I don’t know if this is.	Ma nafx jekk dan hux.
There was just that.	Kien hemm biss dan.
You should go too.	Għandek tmur ukoll.
Much of that around.	Ħafna minn dak madwar.
You can't just go.	Inti ma tistax tmur biss.
It says nothing more.	Ma jgħid xejn aktar.
Unless what you are talking about is something else.	Sakemm dak li qed titkellem dwar xi ħaġa oħra.
It was a lot, it was a lot.	Kien ħafna, kien ħafna.
But a long time had passed.	Imma kien għadda żmien twil.
It will help a lot of people.	Se jgħin ħafna nies.
But he will not leave.	Imma hu mhux se jitlaq.
We can't do anything.	Aħna ma nistgħu nagħmlu xejn.
In fact, it is not.	Fil-fatt, mhuwiex.
I say nothing.	Jien ngħid xejn.
Everything else will remain the same.	Kollox ieħor se jibqa' l-istess.
And you want more too.	U trid aktar ukoll.
I know it will.	Naf li se.
On, too fast.	Fuq, malajr wisq.
And so they are doing.	U hekk qed jagħmlu.
I didn’t really think about it.	Jien ma tantx ħsibt dwarha.
Nobody friend.	Ħadd ħabib.
This was a good time.	Dan kien żmien mhux ħażin.
Everyone went home now.	Kulħadd mar id-dar issa.
There really was.	Kien hemm tassew.
That was where he wanted to be right now.	Dak kien fejn ried ikun bħalissa.
You want too much.	Trid wisq.
If you think you are surprised.	Jekk taħseb li inti sorpriż.
Maybe you don't.	Forsi inti ma.
I was happy to do that.	Kont kuntent li nagħmel dan.
Everything is done now.	Kollox sar issa.
We can do more and better.	Nistgħu nagħmlu aktar u aħjar.
I understand why you did that.	Nifhem għaliex għamilt hekk.
It will be beautiful.	Se tkun sabiħa.
Too long ago.	Wisq twil ilu.
I want the whole truth.	Irrid il-verità kollha.
I'm sure not.	Jien żgur li ma.
Not too much really.	Mhux wisq verament.
I do that.	Jien nagħmel dan.
Now we know it’s not.	Issa nafu li mhuwiex.
It will be a beautiful thing.	Se tkun ħaġa sabiħa.
It’s something you want not to do.	Hija xi ħaġa li trid ma tagħmilx.
If not, who will ?.	Jekk le, min se?.
It may just be a good thing.	Jista 'jkun biss ħaġa tajba.
It's how it's done.	Huwa kif isir.
No one will ever know.	Ħadd qatt ma jkun jaf.
No one will do this for you.	Ħadd mhu se jagħmel dan għalik.
This definitely happened to me.	Dan żgur li ġara għalija.
Who we are.	Min aħna.
Nothing wrong there.	Xejn ħażin hemmhekk.
That comes later.	Dak jiġi aktar tard.
It went a little better later.	Mar ftit aħjar aktar tard.
You can’t stand here alone.	Ma tistax toqgħod hawn waħdek.
Not you, not them.	Mhux int, mhux huma.
It was already, if he wanted to.	Kien diġà, kieku ried.
I know he would say so as well.	Naf li kien jgħid hekk ukoll.
But he can't.	Imma ma jistax.
It stays almost entirely out of me.	Jibqa' kważi għal kollox barra minni.
I almost did.	Kważi għamilt.
And on and on and on goes so.	U fuq u fuq u fuq tmur hekk.
This is not difficult.	Dan mhux diffiċli.
There is no easy way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod faċli.
Well, she wasn’t doing it.	Ukoll, hi ma kinitx tagħmel dan.
I love how it looks now.	Inħobb kif tidher issa.
It would be such a beautiful thing for me.	Tkun ħaġa tant sabiħa għalija.
Not much here.	Mhux ħafna hawn.
I'm so scared, almost.	Nibża' hekk, kważi.
He was a small man.	Kien raġel żgħir.
So it must be.	Hekk għandu jkun.
It will be good again.	Se jkun tajjeb mill-ġdid.
He doesn’t like to play outside.	Ma jħobbx jilgħab barra.
Here's a chance.	Hawn ċans.
Never say never.	Qatt tgħid qatt.
One cannot know something that is not so.	Wieħed ma jistax ikun jaf xi ħaġa li mhix hekk.
And he was good at it.	U kien tajjeb li għamel.
In fact, it’s already happening.	Fil-fatt, diġà qed jiġri.
You can do this if you want.	Tista 'tagħmel dan jekk trid.
I can count on that.	Jien nista' noqgħod fuq dan.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
But it is going well.	Imma sejjer tajjeb.
I know so much.	Naf daqshekk.
You are really beautiful.	Int tassew sabiħa.
Get there if you can.	Wasal hemm jekk tista'.
This I can see.	Dan nista' nara jien.
Just did nothing.	Biss xejn ma għamel.
And she was doing it.	U kienet tagħmel dan.
I'm very happy.	Jien kuntent ħafna.
It was very, very good.	Kien tajjeb ħafna, ħafna.
He will never know.	Hu qatt mhu se jkun jaf.
And me too.	U jien ukoll.
It was just said.	Kien biss qal.
I didn’t just think this was going to happen.	Ma kontx biss ħsibt li dan kien se jiġri.
But there is help.	Imma hemm għajnuna.
With a man.	Ma' raġel.
This is very very bad !!!.	Dan huwa ħażin ħafna ħafna!!!.
You are not ready.	M'intix lest.
Do you have a child? ' 	Għandek tifel?'
It would be so.	Ikun hekk.
And it is very small.	U huwa żgħir ħafna.
It's fast.	Huwa malajr.
But that seems to have happened.	Imma dan jidher li ġara.
It actually works pretty well.	Fil-fatt jaħdem pjuttost tajjeb.
I've never heard of this.	Qatt ma smajt b’dan.
Help only.	Għajnuna biss.
I know my doing.	Naf tiegħi tagħmel.
Now this is not such a good idea.	Issa din mhix idea daqshekk tajba.
Maybe there's something he can do.	Forsi hemm xi ħaġa li jista’ jagħmel.
It happened before.	Ġara qabel.
You still are.	Għadek int.
I wasn’t there.	Jien ma kontx hemm.
Now, let’s.	Issa, ejja.
Why is it supposed to be easy ?.	Għaliex suppost li tkun faċli?.
It was all pretty quick.	Kien kollox pjuttost malajr.
But it looks like.	Imma qisu.
But it wasn’t.	Imma ma kienx.
He loved to eat.	Kien iħobb jiekol.
And it’s not going that big.	U mhux sejjer daqshekk kbir.
That would be really too much.	Dan ikun tassew wisq.
That was yesterday.	Dak kien il-bieraħ.
Please come home with me.	Jekk jogħġbok ejja d-dar miegħi.
You know, you don’t even have to do that.	Taf, lanqas m'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel dan.
I'm sure he would.	Jien ċert li kieku.
Well, maybe more than a little.	Ukoll, forsi aktar minn ftit.
How does it look ?.	Kif tidher?.
But that would be so difficult.	Imma dan ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
He would do it again.	Kien jerġa’ jagħmel.
That's good and bad.	Dak tajjeb u ħażin.
There it is outside.	Hemm barra .
He was quick, too.	Huwa kien malajr, ukoll.
But you still are not.	Imma għadek m'intix.
Come with me.	Ejja miegħi.
I can see that.	Jien nista' nara dan.
I have nothing to do with myself.	M'għandi xejn miegħi.
Same as before.	L-istess bħal qabel.
I have seen this time and time again.	Rajt dan darba u darba.
They are my friends.	Huma ħbieb tiegħi.
This is a quick one.	Din hija waħda ta 'malajr.
In fact, this happened pretty quickly.	Fil-fatt, dan ġara pjuttost malajr.
First no.	L-ewwel le.
I have now.	Għandi issa.
I'm afraid you're right.	Nibża li għandek raġun.
Just a friend, all that.	Ħabib biss, dak kollu.
I think you do what you want.	Naħseb li tagħmel li trid.
You don’t have to tell me you’re tired.	M'għandekx għalfejn tgħidli li int għajjien.
Everything had happened too fast.	Kollox kien ġara malajr wisq.
Not a chance, of course.	Mhux ċans ta’ dan, ovvjament.
Let’s do this first.	Ejja nagħmlu dan l-ewwel.
Maybe what he did to me wasn’t so bad.	Forsi dak li għamel miegħi ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
You are doing something.	Qed tagħmel xi ħaġa.
It just seems like something to say.	Jidher biss xi ħaġa li tgħid.
Which it doesn’t.	Li ma jagħmilx.
And he will obviously take a long time.	U hu ovvjament se jieħu ħafna ħin.
Now it is too late.	Issa huwa tard wisq.
And that can never happen.	U dan qatt ma jista’ jiġri.
And to be happy.	U li tkun kuntent.
I can’t do that again.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
But it will be good.	Imma se jkun tajjeb.
So are you, probably.	Hekk int, probabbilment.
I'm very happy.	Jien kuntent ħafna.
Come on, we have to go.	Ejja, irridu mmorru.
He had to go now.	Kellu jmur issa.
Not everyone is like that.	Mhux kulħadd huwa hekk.
I was going to be one of these.	Jien kont inkun wieħed minn dawn.
Or maybe something else is playing.	Jew forsi xi ħaġa oħra qed jilgħab.
And a job he did !.	U xogħol li għamel!.
But it was not always so.	Imma mhux dejjem kien hekk.
No one has seen anything like it.	Ħadd ma ra xi ħaġa bħal din.
You have to make up for it.	Trid tagħmel tajjeb għalih.
So far, no problem.	Sa issa, l-ebda problema.
It wasn’t hard.	Ma kienx diffiċli.
It’s my only way out of this.	Huwa l-uniku mod tiegħi minn dan.
I’m actually happy for you.	Jien fil-fatt kuntent għalik.
You are always doing one or the other.	Dejjem qed tagħmel wieħed jew ieħor.
Something else was wrong.	Xi ħaġa oħra kienet ħażina.
We really aren't.	Aħna verament mhux.
And he did something about it.	U għamel xi ħaġa dwarha.
Not even anyone.	Lanqas ħadd.
Someone else has already said this.	Xi ħadd ieħor diġà qal dan.
You will never come back.	Inti qatt ma lura.
And it can be good.	U jista 'jkun tajjeb.
That's not good.	Dak mhux tajjeb.
She had to know where he was.	Kellha tkun taf fejn kien.
He was the only one who could.	Kien l-uniku wieħed li seta’.
It's just being here.	Huwa biss qed hawn.
Time will surely tell.	Iż-żmien żgur jgħid.
But it needed to happen.	Imma kien jeħtieġ li jiġri.
He was just making fun of me.	Kien qed jagħmel gost miegħi biss.
Let me say this.	Ħa ngħid dan.
I actually wanted to ask about it.	Fil-fatt ridt nistaqsi dwar dan.
And maybe.	U forsi.
We have done all this before.	Dan kollu għamilna qabel.
I saw his work.	Rajt ix-xogħol tiegħu.
It’s not the first time.	Mhix l-ewwel darba.
This will be more of the same.	Dan se jkun aktar l-istess.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
I’m just going to stay home.	Jien biss se noqgħod id-dar.
It’s bad enough to do that.	Huwa ħażin biżżejjed li tagħmel dan.
None of these things happened.	Xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet ma ġara.
I’m not seeing that.	Jien mhux qed nara hekk.
It makes you go.	Jagħmel inti tmur.
There is something else to do.	Hemm xi ħaġa oħra li għandek tagħmel.
You obviously know what you are doing.	Int ovvjament taf x'qed tagħmel.
It's easier.	Huwa aktar faċli.
I can't talk to you now.	Ma nistax nitkellem miegħek issa.
Like, he doesn’t have that.	Bħal, hu m'għandux dak.
It works very well for me.	Jaħdem tajjeb ħafna għalija.
It’s too early to tell.	Għadu kmieni wisq biex tgħid.
Try everything.	Ipprova kollox.
Let’s go back a few years ago.	Ejja mmorru lura ftit snin ilu.
I want so many things.	Irrid tant affarijiet.
I didn’t see anything else.	Jien ma rajt xejn aktar.
It is not easy to take.	Mhix faċli tieħu.
Someone is in the room with me.	Xi ħadd qiegħed fil-kamra miegħi.
He is not even afraid.	Hu lanqas jibża’.
This happens quickly.	Dan jiġri malajr.
Waiting.	Ta’ min jistenna.
He who he is.	Hu min hu.
It was the last thing.	Kienet l-aħħar ħaġa.
I think he told me.	Naħseb li qalli.
Just not too big.	Biss mhux kbir wisq.
I wasn’t doing anything.	Ma kont qed tagħmel xejn.
That’s not a big deal.	Dik mhix xi ħaġa kbira.
What he had to do.	Dak li kellu jagħmel.
No one needs to know.	Ħadd ma għandu bżonn ikun jaf.
You are coming with us.	Int ġej magħna.
The truth can be wrong.	Il-verità tista’ tkun ħażina.
For many people, too.	Għal ħafna nies, ukoll.
He did everything he could now.	Kien għamel dak kollu li seta’ issa.
It just works very well.	Huwa biss jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
It wasn’t just them.	Ma kienx hemm huma biss.
He had to leave.	Kellu jitlaq.
But its not.	Imma tiegħu mhux.
I think both.	Naħseb it-tnejn.
It won’t be a big deal.	Mhux se jkun xi ħaġa kbira.
Not easy to do.	Mhux faċli li tagħmel.
He will come for him.	Hu ser jiġi għalih.
I think that's really something.	Naħseb li verament xi ħaġa.
He didn’t want to do that.	Ma riedx jagħmel hekk.
It had to be all or nothing.	Kellu jkun kollox jew xejn.
Now that's good money.	Issa li flus tajba.
This was going to happen soon.	Dan kien se jiġri malajr.
I always thought everyone knew this.	Dejjem ħsibt li kulħadd kien jaf dan.
But you don’t have to do that.	Imma m'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel hekk.
They were the same people we were before.	Kienu l-istess nies li konna qabel.
I can’t take it anymore.	Ma nistax nieħu aktar.
We need more than that.	Għandna bżonn aktar minn dan.
That’s who you really are.	Dak hu min int verament.
It seems you can do something.	Jidher li tista' tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I want to do all this.	Irrid nagħmel dan kollu.
Usually there wasn’t enough to need one.	Normalment ma kienx hemm biżżejjed biex ikollu bżonn wieħed.
That would be enough.	Dan ikun biżżejjed.
But something was wrong, very wrong.	Imma xi ħaġa kienet ħażina, ħażina ħafna.
But he’s good, apparently.	Imma hu tajjeb, milli jidher.
No, not tomorrow.	Le, mhux għada.
He was happier.	Kien aktar ferħan.
This is what you should do.	Dan huwa dak li għandek tagħmel.
You know where you are going.	Taf fejn sejjer.
Obviously it had to happen.	Ovvjament kellu jiġri.
He didn’t even have to.	Hu lanqas biss kellu.
It can happen.	Huwa jista 'jiġri.
This is about much more than that.	Dan huwa dwar ħafna aktar minn hekk.
Probably not.	Probabbilment mhux.
He just had to.	Huwa kellu biss.
I will make one but I don’t know when.	Se nagħmel waħda imma ma nafx meta.
But there was someone else.	Imma kien hemm xi ħadd ieħor.
I’ve been doing it now, you know.	Jien stajt nagħmel dan issa, taf.
It can be a lot.	Jista 'jkun ħafna.
He would be a good man if something happened.	Ikun raġel tajjeb jekk jiġri xi ħaġa.
He plays great.	Huwa jilgħab kbir.
It went very well for quite a while.	Mar tajjeb ħafna għal żmien mhux ħażin.
If it came to that.	Jekk wasal għal dak.
You see why there might be.	Inti tara għaliex jista 'jkun hemm.
But it will not be enough.	Imma mhux se jkun biżżejjed.
I have nothing more to say about this.	M'għandi xejn aktar xi ngħid dwar dan.
Maybe we were.	Forsi konna.
I love everything he does.	Inħobb dak kollu li jagħmel.
We know for sure these.	Aħna nafu żgur li dawn.
This was not a way for anyone to survive.	Dan ma kien mod biex xi ħadd jgħix.
It probably makes things a lot easier.	Probabbilment jagħmel l-affarijiet ħafna aktar faċli.
I really am.	Jien tassew.
It was all ready.	Kien kollu lest.
Here's what you have.	Hawn dak li għandek.
I didn’t want to think why.	Ma ridtx taħseb għaliex.
He actually loved school.	Fil-fatt iħobb l-iskola.
Now, and you don’t.	Issa, u m'għandekx.
This is what you should be doing.	Dan huwa dak li għandek tkun qed tagħmel.
Maybe he just needed some time, too.	Forsi hu biss kellu bżonn ftit ħin, ukoll.
It’s just you and me.	Huwa biss int u jien.
I didn’t know this until later.	Dan ma kontx naf sa aktar tard.
The house looks great.	Id-dar tidher kbira.
Later, he was saying.	Aktar tard, kien qed jgħid.
It's so easy !.	Huwa daqshekk faċli!.
He looked great.	Huwa deher kbir.
It was probably good for him to leave after all.	Probabbilment kien tajjeb għalih li jitlaq wara kollox.
I am not very surprised.	Jiena ma tantx sorpriż.
I’m telling you the truth.	Jien ngħidlek il-verità.
I was really, really surprised.	Kont tassew, tassew sorpriż.
He couldn’t say exactly why.	Ma setax jgħid eżatt għaliex.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
as soon as possible.	malajr kemm jista 'jkun.
That would do it.	Dak kien jagħmel dan.
He would have done so.	Kieku hekk għamel.
But he knows he is right.	Imma jaf li għandu raġun.
Here's where you want to be.	Hawn fejn trid tkun.
That or or, that or.	Li jew jew, li jew jew.
That will never happen.	Dak qatt mhu se jiġri.
I have that.	Jien għandi dak.
I hope this is not so.	Nispera li dan mhux hekk.
He may have seen what happened.	Jista’ jkun li ra x’ġara.
It was never like this.	Qatt ma kien bħal dan.
I saw that.	Rajt dak.
He’s just a little boy.	Huwa biss tifel żgħir.
I have a chance and you don’t have time.	Għandi ċans u m'għandekx ħin.
She is too home.	Hija wisq id-dar.
I think the same today.	Naħseb l-istess illum.
Everything will be fine.	Kollox se jkun tajjeb.
We made quite a bit of money.	Għamilna pjuttost ftit flus.
Speaking for me of course.	Titkellem għalija ovvjament.
There was no one else.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor.
For me that’s the first thing in the morning.	Għalija dik hija l-ewwel ħaġa filgħodu.
Not too much to see.	Mhux wisq x'tara.
I know you want to.	Naf li trid.
It is being done wrong.	Qed isir ħażin.
I had come into my own, by then.	I kien daħal fi tiegħi, sa dak iż-żmien.
It works all the time.	Jaħdem il-ħin kollu.
It’s good, you know.	Huwa tajjeb, taf.
There is only so much he can do.	Hemm biss daqshekk li jista 'jagħmel.
Well, that wasn’t happening.	Ukoll, dan ma kienx qed jiġri.
Something needs to happen.	Jeħtieġ li jiġri xi ħaġa.
Nothing is more certain.	Xejn mhu aktar ċert.
He only found out what had happened later.	Huwa sar jaf biss dak li kien ġara aktar tard.
We had to be both together.	Kellna nkunu t-tnejn flimkien.
That wasn’t me, but it almost was.	Dan ma kontx jien, imma kważi kien.
He never was.	Hu qatt ma kien.
It turned out pretty easy.	Ħareġ pjuttost faċli.
I would know you.	Jien inkun naf li int.
But tell her to be back.	Imma għid li tkun lura.
He wanted something he could do on his own.	Ried xi ħaġa li jista’ jagħmel waħdu.
In fact it was.	Fil-fatt kienet.
He was able to do it all.	Kien kapaċi jagħmel dan kollu.
It looks a little too little too late.	Qisu ftit wisq ftit wisq tard.
He never had another job.	Qatt ma kellu xogħol ieħor.
Just like any other.	Eżatt bħal kull ieħor.
I’m trying to think now.	Qed nipprova naħseb issa.
There is no one else you can talk to.	M'hemm ħadd ieħor li tista' titkellem miegħu.
We have done everything before !.	Għamilna kollox qabel!.
Well, it wasn’t.	Ukoll, ma kienx.
That's just wrong.	Dak huwa biss ħażin.
It should be good.	Għandu jkun tajjeb.
It was all fun.	Kien kollu gost.
I can't understand that.	Ma nistax nifhem hekk.
I can’t do what you do.	Ma nistax nagħmel dak li tagħmel int.
And here it became a little difficult.	U hawn sar xi ftit diffiċli.
So is mine.	Hekk ukoll tiegħi.
Too late now.	Tard wisq issa.
They have to.	Għandhom .
Now he was home.	Issa kien id-dar.
And this is difficult.	U dan huwa diffiċli.
Not only that.	Mhux biss.
Maybe, something else.	Forsi, xi ħaġa oħra.
It wasn’t all bad.	Ma kienx kollu ħażin.
Who said little and did a lot.	Min qal ftit u għamel ħafna.
We are the first.	Aħna l-ewwel.
He just wanted his friend back.	Ried biss lil ħabib tiegħu lura.
And he was waiting.	U kien qed jistenna.
Come on, big man.	Ejja, raġel kbir.
I don’t know who.	Ma nafx ma min.
And that’s not all.	U dan mhux kollox.
Maybe more than enough.	Forsi aktar minn biżżejjed.
Quite a long time ago.	Pjuttost żmien twil ilu.
It sure went through a lot.	Huwa żgur li għadda minn ħafna.
We have ours.	Aħna għandna tagħna.
I hurried to his house.	Għamilt malajr lejn id-dar tiegħu.
I was very worried.	Kont inkwetat ħafna.
It’s good, not bad.	Huwa tajjeb, mhux ħażin.
No, today there will be none of these.	Le, illum mhu se jkun hemm ħadd minn dawn.
Around here you can.	Madwar hawn tista'.
And that was a problem.	U dik kienet problema.
Size finished around.	Daqs lest madwar.
Well, now it’s time.	Tajjeb, issa wasal iż-żmien.
It wasn’t always like that.	Ma kienx hekk dejjem.
We had a great time.	Kellna ħafna ħin.
I want to know.	Irrid inkun naf.
There was another problem.	Kien hemm problema oħra.
I'll be back tomorrow morning.	Ser inkun lura għada filgħodu.
I'd better go back later.	Aħjar nerġa’ lura wara.
But, of course, this is nothing.	Imma, ovvjament, dan mhu xejn.
There are some problems there.	Hemm xi problemi hemm.
It had to be something else.	Kellha tkun xi ħaġa oħra.
Just one of many.	Wieħed biss minn ħafna.
I'm there.	Jien qiegħed hemm.
Or maybe you don’t talk at all.	Jew forsi ma titkellem xejn.
I just wasn’t up to it, really.	I biss ma kontx sa dan, verament.
He was not surprised at all.	Ma kien sorpriż xejn.
This may take a year or more.	Dan jista 'jieħu sena jew aktar.
Everything seemed ready to go.	Kollox deher lest biex imur.
No, not so much.	Le, mhux hekk.
The first year was difficult.	L-ewwel sena kienet diffiċli.
I always take a lot of time talking to him.	Jien dejjem nieħu ħafna ħin nitkellem miegħu.
It’s nothing more than that.	Mhu xejn aktar minn hekk.
This really can’t be happening.	Dan verament ma jistax ikun qed jiġri.
She must be going late.	Hija trid tkun qed tmur tard.
But there must be other things.	Imma jrid ikun hemm affarijiet oħra.
I thought it was too long for me.	Ħsibt li kien twil wisq għalija.
This happened once.	Dan ġara darba.
All he could do was wait.	Kull ma seta’ jagħmel hu li jistenna.
Not at all.	Mhux hekk xejn.
I was sitting down.	Jien kont noqgħod bilqiegħda.
Everyone needs one.	Kulħadd għandu bżonn wieħed.
This had to work.	Dan kellu jaħdem.
Not sure if he will do it.	Mhux ċert jekk hux se jagħmel dan.
He got there early.	Wasal hemm kmieni.
I have a big problem.	Għandi problema kbira.
That is, he thought.	Dan hu, ħaseb.
Better not even think about it.	Aħjar lanqas biss taħseb dwarha.
There is a lot that needs to be done.	Hemm ħafna bżonn isir.
Maybe, it’s for most people.	Forsi, huwa għal ħafna nies.
Someone was coming.	Kien ġej xi ħadd.
But there would never be such a chance.	Imma qatt ma jkun hemm ċans bħal dan.
That’s just what it does.	Huwa biss dak li jagħmel.
Almost anything you want.	Kważi kull ħaġa li trid.
No one else would.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien se.
I know you are right.	Naf li għandek raġun.
But they do work.	Imma jagħmlu xogħol.
And besides, he was right.	U barra minn hekk, kellu raġun.
Just me, really.	Jien biss, tassew.
I always said so.	Dejjem għidt hekk.
I didn’t want to believe it.	Ma ridtx nemmen.
She didn’t know why she had to say anything.	Ma kinitx taf għaliex kellha tgħid xejn.
You can’t do this job alone.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan ix-xogħol waħdek.
It looks good.	Jidher li huwa tajjeb.
I really can’t say, sure.	Verament ma nistax ngħid, żgur.
He wanted to try something.	Ried jipprova xi ħaġa.
More where this came from.	Aktar minn fejn ġie dan.
I’m still at work.	Għadni fuq ix-xogħol.
I’m not saying anything.	Jien ma ngħid xejn.
But he found out.	Imma sar jaf.
This is a man to have.	Dan huwa raġel li għandu.
So we did today.	Hekk għamilna llum.
But there was nothing he could do.	Imma ma seta’ jagħmel xejn.
This seems like a long time.	Dan jidher qisu żmien twil.
Everything was going so fast.	Kollox kien sejjer daqshekk malajr.
It was very good.	Kien tajjeb ħafna.
Everyone wants it that way.	Kulħadd irid hekk.
It was probably a good thing she wasn’t here.	Probabbilment kienet ħaġa tajba li ma kinitx hawn.
I don’t need help with this.	M'għandix bżonn għajnuna b'dan.
And all for nothing.	U kollox għal xejn.
He was so good to me.	Huwa kien daqshekk tajjeb għalija.
This can be good.	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb.
But he wanted more.	Imma ried aktar.
That’s what you’re supposed to do.	Dak hu li suppost tagħmel.
This looks good.	Dan jidher tajjeb.
I think he is right.	Naħseb li għandu raġun.
And she was there.	U hi kienet hemm.
I couldn’t take it anymore.	Ma stajtx nieħu aktar.
It was also very helpful to me at times.	Kien ukoll ta’ għajnuna kbira għalija xi drabi.
I did so as well.	Jien għamilt hekk ukoll.
We will do that.	Aħna se nagħmlu dan.
The problem seems too great.	Il-problema tidher kbira wisq.
It would not be difficult.	Ma jkunx diffiċli.
A great one.	Waħda kbira.
I don’t think about it.	Ma naħsibx dwar dan.
No one did that, either.	Ħadd ma għamel hekk, lanqas.
No one knew who they were.	Ħadd ma kien jaf min kienu.
Someone might be here.	Jista’ jkun hawn xi ħadd.
Above all.	Fuq kollox.
Not a bad one.	Mhix waħda ħażina.
But even that wasn’t a big deal.	Imma lanqas dan ma kienx xi ħaġa kbira.
I knew he knew this too.	Kont naf li kien jaf dan ukoll.
You are who you are.	Int min int.
And this is wrong.	U dan huwa ħażin.
And it’s not working.	U mhux qed jaħdem.
It's the same.	Huwa l-istess.
None of these felt as good as his.	Ħadd minn dawn ma ħassu tajjeb daqs tiegħu.
So do many other people.	Hekk jagħmlu ħafna nies oħra.
This is about as good as ever.	Dan huwa madwar tajjeb daqs qatt qabel.
It's where you want to be.	Huwa fejn trid tkun.
I didn’t do anything of my own.	Jien ma għamilt xejn minn tiegħi.
They were about fun fun fun.	Kienu dwar gost gost gost.
Fear of the unknown.	Jibża’ min ma jkunx jaf.
I will always be alone.	Jien dejjem inkun waħdi.
I'm going home.	Jien se mmur id-dar.
It does.	Jagħmel hekk.
Good to know.	Tajjeb li tkun taf.
She was where she was, coming home.	Kienet fejn kienet, tiġi d-dar.
I just want the truth about other people.	Irrid biss il-verità dwar nies oħra.
There was no more.	Ma kienx hemm aktar.
Nobody talks to each other.	Ħadd ma jitkellem ma’ xulxin.
You only have another year.	Għandek sena oħra biss.
You want to do something about it.	Trid tagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
I can't do anything.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn.
Bad morning.	Filgħodu ħażin.
More than finished.	Aktar minn lest.
He looked at his friend.	Huwa ħares lejn ħabib tiegħu.
Why not? 	Għaliex le?
he said.	hu qal.
I’ve seen that.	Jien stajt nara dak.
There was no help for him here.	Ma kienet l-ebda għajnuna għalih hawn.
It could be anything, or it could be anything.	Jista 'jkun xi ħaġa, jew jista' jkun xejn.
You should do this more often.	Għandek tagħmel dan aktar spiss.
Everything was ready.	Kollox kien lest.
One at a time is difficult.	Wieħed kull darba huwa diffiċli.
I really, really I am.	Jien tassew, tassew jien.
You seem to have a problem.	Jidher li għandek problema.
For many.	Għal ħafna.
I had enough.	Kelli biżżejjed.
Definitely want to know what this is.	Żgur li trid tkun taf x'inhu dan.
I have too.	Jien ukoll għandi.
Everything was as it should be.	Kollox kien kif suppost.
That must be.	Li trid tkun.
It's just for a lot more.	Huwa biss għal ħafna aktar.
You talk whenever you think it's good to.	Inti titkellem kull meta taħseb li huwa tajjeb li.
And he always leaves.	U dejjem jitlaq.
That's it.	Dak hu.
And it was all ours.	U kien kollu tagħna.
I know you have.	Naf li għandek.
They were the same as ever.	Kienu l-istess bħal qatt qabel.
It had to be something.	Kellha tkun xi ħaġa.
Not so, please not so! 	Mhux hekk, jekk jogħġbok mhux hekk!
.	.
This helps a little.	Dan jgħin ftit.
It takes almost no time.	Jieħu kważi l-ebda ħin.
Still bad.	Għadu ħażin.
I had been coming back to us for a long time.	Kont ilni ġejt lura għandna.
I wish it wasn’t.	Nixtieq li ma jkunx.
That's pretty quick.	Dak pjuttost malajr.
Don't say anything.	Ma tgħid xejn.
This is wrong.	Dan huwa ħażin.
So do we here, after all.	Hekk nagħmlu hawn, wara kollox.
Well, with you this afternoon.	Tajjeb, miegħek illum wara nofsinhar.
Maybe not a bad time.	Forsi żmien mhux ħażin.
Probably no one will.	Probabbilment ħadd ma se.
I’m not happy that this happened.	Jien mhux kuntent li ġara dan.
I had time.	Kelli ħin.
Or maybe it wasn’t him.	Jew forsi ma kienx hu.
I thought about everything else.	Ħsibt dwar kull ħaġa oħra.
He had never done this before.	Hu qatt ma kien għamel dan qabel.
But that’s not such a bad thing.	Imma dik mhix ħaġa ħażina daqshekk.
This is good to know.	Dan huwa tajjeb li tkun taf.
I can’t have that, not yet.	Ma nistax ikolli dan, għadu mhux.
It can be very good for you.	Jista 'jkun tajjeb ħafna għalik.
And it was a great help to me.	U kont ta’ għajnuna kbira għalija.
We had been there.	Kellna konna hemm.
He is a very bad man.	Huwa raġel ħażin ħafna.
I'm surprised you're here.	Jien sorpriż li int hawn.
It was a very bad year.	Kienet sena ħażina ħafna.
You need to talk about it.	Jeħtieġ li titkellem dwarha.
Definitely nothing happened.	Żgur li ma ġara xejn.
Nothing was happening.	Xejn ma kien jiġri.
And you can see why he says that.	U wieħed jista’ jara għaliex jgħid dan.
Exactly what every child needs.	Eżatt dak li kull tifel għandu bżonn.
It can’t be all that bad.	Ma jistax ikun dak kollu ħażin.
You can be sure of that.	Minn dan tista’ tkun ċert.
It's really nothing.	Huwa verament xejn.
It was good to me so.	Kien tajjeb miegħi hekk.
Everything can wait.	Kollox jista' jistenna.
And that he will be back soon.	U li hu ser ikun lura dalwaqt.
I have no idea about that.	M'għandi l-ebda idea dwar dan.
It was wrong to do so.	Kien ħażin li tagħmel hekk.
Afternoon is a good time to talk.	Wara nofsinhar huwa żmien tajjeb biex titkellem.
I’m sorry she was here altogether.	Jiddispjaċini li kienet hawn għal kollox.
Sure, you are busy.	Żgur, inti okkupat.
He needed to think things out on his own.	Kellu bżonn jaħseb l-affarijiet waħdu.
Neither is she.	Lanqas hi.
I know nothing more about this.	Ma naf xejn aktar dwar dan.
I didn’t, you know.	Ma kontx, taf.
You both have.	It-tnejn għandek.
And you know too much.	U taf wisq wisq.
I can't speak.	Ma nistax nitkellem.
There is one way to be sure.	Hemm mod wieħed biex tkun ċert.
That was the same, too.	Dak kien l-istess, ukoll.
It does a lot for us.	Jagħmel ħafna għalina.
You know that better than me.	Inti taf li aħjar minni.
More than glad.	Aktar minn ferħan.
Just not mine.	Biss mhux tiegħi.
I should have known.	I kellha tkun naf.
I can’t just stand here.	Ma nistax noqgħod hawn biss.
It will be too late.	Hija se tkun tard.
They do what they do.	Huma jagħmlu dak li jagħmlu.
What happened is this.	Dak li ġara huwa dan.
There is a car behind.	Hemm karozza lura.
You know why you’re here.	Taf għaliex int hawn.
Maybe again.	Forsi darba oħra.
He was a good man.	Kien raġel tajjeb.
But it wasn’t.	Imma ma kinitx.
And you do.	U inti tagħmel.
No, he didn’t need one, he said.	Le, ma kellux bżonn wieħed, qal.
They are more so, now, than ever.	Huma aktar hekk, issa, minn qatt qabel.
Let’s go and have some real fun.	Ejja mmorru u nieħu gost tassew.
And it worked.	U kien jaħdem.
But it is the only thing we can do.	Imma hija l-unika ħaġa li nistgħu nagħmlu.
She had never done anything like that before.	Qatt ma kienet għamlet xi ħaġa bħal dik qabel.
But this is the last time.	Imma din hija l-aħħar darba.
The book, the book, the book.	Il-ktieb, il-ktieb, il-ktieb.
That’s all, and it’s almost nothing.	Dan huwa kollox, u huwa kważi xejn.
It should be very easy for you.	Għandu jkun faċli ħafna għalik.
Well, it happened.	Ukoll, ġara.
Or maybe nothing.	Jew forsi xejn.
That’s a great thing.	Dik hija ħaġa kbira.
It will always be late.	Dejjem ikun tard.
No one is left alone.	Ħadd ma jibqa’ waħdu.
It may have appeared.	Seta’ deher.
I didn’t do anything more than that.	Jien ma għamilt xejn aktar minn hekk.
I need both.	Għandi bżonn it-tnejn.
It's just me.	Jien biss jien.
Easier said than done.	Aktar faċli għalik li tgħid.
I think she is beautiful.	Naħseb li hija sabiħa.
I speak the truth.	Jien nitkellem il-verità.
I have a problem with someone like that.	Ikolli problema ma 'xi ħadd bħal dak.
He didn’t even know how to think about it.	Lanqas kien jaf kif jaħseb dwarha.
It would be difficult.	Ikun diffiċli.
Probably never.	Probabbilment qatt ma.
I just wanted something to happen.	Ridt biss li jiġri xi ħaġa.
You are both right.	Għandek raġun it-tnejn.
You can't do more.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel aktar.
Maybe it was still.	Forsi kien għadu.
I really enjoy it !.	Jien tassew nieħu gost!.
I was going to be hard in the morning.	Jien kont inkun diffiċli filgħodu.
He became worried.	Sar inkwetat.
Everything happened before.	Kollox ġara qabel.
We always will, in fact.	Aħna dejjem se, fil-fatt.
Not worried about it a bit.	Mhux inkwetat dwar dan daqsxejn.
It’s just hard to tell.	Huwa biss diffiċli li tgħid.
I didn’t know who.	Ma kontx naf min.
It's easy to please.	Hija faċli biex jekk jogħġbok.
There will be no other.	Mhux se jkun hemm ieħor.
Maybe they do.	Forsi hekk jagħmlu dan.
Things were as they were.	L-affarijiet kienu kif kienu.
But he just left.	Imma hu telaq biss.
Come back here.	Ejja lura hawn.
This should be so.	Dan għandu jkun hekk.
Something happens there.	Hemmhekk jiġri xi ħaġa.
And so it will be.	U hekk se jkun.
He didn't, of course.	Huwa ma, ovvjament.
It may be already too late.	Jista' jkun diġà tard wisq.
I will try again !.	Għadni se nipprova!.
It has been out forever.	Ilu barra għal dejjem.
Now is a good time.	Issa huwa żmien tajjeb.
Some people are like that.	Xi nies huma hekk.
You are wrong.	Inti ħażin.
So we are home.	Hekk aħna d-dar.
You sure know your stuff, my friend.	Int żgur li taf l-affarijiet tiegħek, ħabib tiegħi.
I’m none of these things.	Jien xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet.
Maybe a year.	Forsi sena.
He played.	Huwa kellu.
That’s it, no more waiting.	Dak hu, mhux aktar wieħed jistenna.
Obviously, it’s both.	Ovvjament, huwa t-tnejn.
And you know that.	U inti taf li.
I have to talk to someone.	Ikolli nitkellem ma' xi ħadd.
I’m never good enough.	Jien qatt ma tajjeb biżżejjed.
But he would.	Imma kieku għamel.
But nothing had happened.	Imma ma kien ġara xejn.
It will do all of the above.	Se tagħmel dak kollu ta 'hawn fuq.
Well, now that was too much, there.	Tajjeb, issa dak kien wisq, hemm.
I love all your work.	Inħobb ix-xogħol kollu tiegħek.
I love being able to do that.	Inħobb inkun kapaċi nagħmel dan.
Why not? 	Għaliex le?
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
Some time passed.	Għadda xi żmien.
You're not there either.	Int lanqas hemm.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
Well it was.	Ukoll kien.
You don’t want to be here.	Inti ma tridx hawn.
She knows this is how it can be.	Hija taf li dan huwa kif jista 'jkun.
That must probably be.	Dak irid ikun probabbilment.
You are alone.	Int waħdek.
He had no one.	Ma kellu lil ħadd.
Or, maybe they were.	Jew, forsi kienu.
Which I believe I have.	Li nemmen li għandi.
Everything seems to be working well.	Jidher li kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
Now with him out, they have a chance.	Issa miegħu barra, għandhom ċans.
It really was.	Kienet tassew.
And there we were.	U hemmhekk konna.
From here there was nothing.	Minn hawn ma kien hemm xejn.
That will do it.	Dak se tagħmel dan.
I thought about everything.	Ħsibt dwar kollox.
I was never there.	Qatt ma kont hemm.
We are so now.	Aħna hekk issa.
But this is for later.	Imma dan huwa għal aktar tard.
I eat what you eat.	Jien niekol dak li tiekol int.
In fact it was very good for me.	Fil-fatt kont tajjeb ħafna għalija.
It’s hard for him.	Huwa diffiċli għalih.
Again, maybe.	Darba oħra, forsi.
She and everyone.	Hi u kulħadd.
And a few more.	U ftit ieħor.
It's all yours.	Hija kollha tiegħek.
Nor does it get better on its own.	Lanqas ma jmur aħjar waħdu.
We don't have time.	M'għandniex ħin.
That’s where we were doing.	Dak fejn konna nagħmlu.
I think so.	Naħseb li hekk.
I just had to know.	Kelli biss inkun naf.
I don't need it anymore.	M'għandix bżonn aktar.
It has to be first.	Għandu jkun l-ewwel.
No, for him, everything was ready.	Le, għalih, kollox kien lest.
Maybe you want to think for a while.	Forsi trid taħseb għal xi żmien.
He came out to find out on his own.	Ħareġ biex isir jaf waħdu.
Everything was too much.	Kollox kien wisq wisq.
I need to be ready.	Għandi bżonn inkun lest.
Which is a very good thing.	Li hija ħaġa tajba ħafna.
I spent a lot of time on this.	Għamilt ħafna ħin fuq dan.
Speak alone.	Titkellem waħdu.
I think about it all.	Naħseb dwar dan kollu.
It came as follows.	Ġie kif ġej.
There is something to do.	Hemm xi ħaġa li tagħmel.
That was what he did.	Dak kien dak li għamel.
I'm out today.	Jien barra llum.
But this is there.	Imma dan qiegħed hemm.
It would be good, as always.	Ikun tajjeb, bħal dejjem.
But not too much.	Imma mhux wisq.
Or so he must have thought.	Jew hekk għandu jkun ħaseb.
That is enough.	Li huwa biżżejjed.
And this is what it does.	U dan huwa dak li jagħmel.
Too much fun.	Wisq gost.
There is no problem there for me.	M'hemm l-ebda problema hemm għalija.
He saw no one.	Ma ra lil ħadd.
You have to come to him.	Trid tiġi għandu.
He was just tired.	Kien biss għajjien.
Here it was.	Hawn kien.
I am sure it will be.	Jiena ċert li se jkun.
It is either going to happen or not.	Huwa jew se jiġri jew le.
And many other things.	U ħafna affarijiet oħra.
Everything was wrong.	Kollox kien ħażin.
He did some great work.	Huwa għamel xi xogħol kbir.
I'm a teacher.	Jien għalliem.
We had a great time.	Kellna ħafna ħin.
But it’s getting harder.	Imma qed isir aktar diffiċli.
Like now.	Bħal issa.
I know everything you have to say.	Naf dak kollu li trid tgħid.
It had been done well.	Kien sar tajjeb.
Nothing like this.	Xejn bħal dan.
I have what you say you need.	Għandi dak li tgħid li għandek bżonn.
He said it will probably be this week.	Qal li probabbilment ikun din il-ġimgħa.
He was from that now.	Huwa kien minn dak issa.
I'm a bad man.	Jien raġel ħażin.
But it never was.	Imma qatt ma kien.
Nor was he thinking so.	Lanqas ma kien qed jaħseb hekk.
This is what is happening now.	Dan huwa dak li qed jiġri issa.
And that’s not all.	U dan mhux kollu.
Arrive early in the afternoon.	Jasal kmieni wara nofsinhar.
He looked bad.	Huwa ħares ħażin.
I just need some time.	Għandi bżonn biss ftit ħin.
About what happened.	Dwar dak li ġara.
He didn’t have the time.	Ma kellux il-ħin.
Now everything was fine.	Issa kollox kien tajjeb.
It's going to come around.	Huwa ser jiġi madwar.
Nothing can ever happen.	Ma jista’ qatt jiġri xejn.
Don’t do it more than it is.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan aktar minn dak li hu.
He stays at home, he's scared.	Joqgħod id-dar, jibża’.
He had had enough today.	Huwa kellu biżżejjed illum.
He is the only one who can say.	Huwa l-uniku wieħed li jista 'jgħid.
There was not enough time.	Ma kienx hemm biżżejjed ħin.
How can you.	Kif tista'.
I don’t think it ever will.	Ma naħsibx li qatt se.
Well, we have and we don’t.	Ukoll, għandna u m'għandniex.
This job makes a lot of fun.	Dan ix-xogħol jagħmel ħafna gost.
I'm with you.	Jien miegħek.
Why are you here.	Għaliex int hawn.
He had never come out.	Hu qatt ma kien ħareġ.
The work is good.	Ix-xogħol huwa tajjeb.
It couldn’t be.	Ma setax ikun.
Let’s go over this.	Ejja mmorru fuq dan.
I think you’re a good man.	Naħseb li int raġel tajjeb.
It was still early in the evening.	Kien għadu kmieni filgħaxija.
It has been there for some time.	Ilu hemm għal xi żmien.
I have to.	Ikolli.
Or I thought I did.	Jew ħsibt li għamilt.
It was more than it seemed to be.	Kien aktar milli deher li kien.
That works well enough.	Li jaħdem tajjeb biżżejjed.
As he knew he would.	Kif kien jaf li kieku.
It has always been there and always will be.	Dejjem kien hemm u dejjem se jkun.
You stay with him.	Inti toqgħod miegħu.
He never told me how he knew.	Qatt ma qalli kif kien jaf.
Come on you.	Ejja int.
He is here to help.	Huwa hawn biex jgħin.
And the time has come.	U wasal iż-żmien.
I do almost the same thing.	Jien nagħmel kważi l-istess ħaġa.
Tonight, if you will.	Illejla, jekk trid.
But it wasn’t going to happen here.	Imma ma kienx se jiġri hawn.
But he doesn’t seem happy.	Imma ma jidhirx kuntent.
No more for me, ever.	Mhux aktar għalija, qatt.
I think more is coming.	Naħseb li ġej aktar.
A few things.	Ftit affarijiet.
Not my things.	Mhux l-affarijiet tiegħi.
Definitely working.	Żgur li qed jaħdem.
It is more than that.	Huwa aktar minn hekk.
She is there.	Hi hemm.
Surely someone wants to know something.	Żgur li xi ħadd irid ikun jaf xi ħaġa.
I want to go there too.	Irrid immur hemm ukoll.
But it is so difficult.	Imma huwa daqshekk diffiċli.
All that is there now.	Dak kollu li hemm issa.
And for not much money.	U għal mhux ħafna flus.
After that, it was an easy job.	Wara dan, kien xogħol faċli.
The problem is, everything you have.	Il-problema hija, dak kollu li għandek.
I was doing the same.	Jien kont nagħmel l-istess.
He lives here.	Jgħix hawn.
I ask later.	Nistaqsi aktar tard.
Nothing has ever been easy for me.	Xejn qatt ma ġie faċli għalija.
I’m not always going to be there.	Jien mhux dejjem se nkun hemm.
I need to tell you about it.	Għandi bżonn ngħidlek dwarha.
It’s hard to sit down.	Huwa diffiċli li toqgħod bilqiegħda.
We have a lot of problems.	Għandna ħafna problemi.
He’s here, and he’s been here.	Huwa hawn, u kien hawn.
Better than it was.	Aħjar milli kien.
I don't think so.	Ma 'naħsibx.
But it was useless.	Imma kien ta’ xejn.
I speak.	Jien nitkellem.
Not like back home.	Mhux bħal lura d-dar.
But it is a great one.	Imma hija waħda kbira.
He's back with us now.	Huwa lura magħna issa.
This was more likely.	Dan kien aktar probabbli.
You can tell.	Tista' tgħid.
It was quite busy.	Kien pjuttost okkupat.
Maybe it was always time.	Forsi kien dejjem iż-żmien.
I see something else.	Nara xi ħaġa oħra.
He seems to have been able to work.	Jidher li kien kapaċi jaħdem.
You have to tell me more or less everything.	Int għandek tgħidli xi ftit jew wisq kollox.
She was always tired.	Kienet dejjem għajjien.
But it’s a beautiful idea.	Imma hija idea sabiħa.
But he would not say, or could not say.	Imma ma kienx jgħid, jew ma setax jgħid.
And of course we can’t.	U ovvjament ma nistgħux.
No one is here yet.	Ħadd għadu hawn.
He just said.	Huwa biss qal.
But once, a long time ago.	Imma darba, żmien twil ilu.
He may be right.	Jista’ jkollu raġun.
I don’t want to be here either.	Ma rridx hawn lanqas.
I think it could be better that way.	Naħseb li jista’ jkun aħjar hekk.
No one could see.	Ħadd ma seta’ jara.
And he didn’t need to.	U ma kellux bżonn.
It’s all the same.	Huwa kollu l-istess.
Everything goes.	Kull ħaġa tmur.
This can take up to three years.	Dan jista 'jieħu sa tliet snin.
I think it happened to me last night.	Naħseb li ġara lili lbieraħ filgħaxija.
It's really a good idea.	Huwa verament idea tajba.
Maybe I knew better.	Forsi kont naf aħjar.
It's worth taking a moment on this.	Ta’ min jieħu ftit ħin fuq dan.
He sees things.	Huwa jara l-affarijiet.
More than anyone knew.	Aktar minn xi ħadd li kien jaf.
We do the following.	Aħna nagħmlu dan li ġej.
She knew that.	Hija kienet taf li.
From now on this is our home, not yours anymore.	Minn issa din hija d-dar tagħna, mhux tiegħek aktar.
It is never a long time.	Qatt huwa żmien twil.
Or do it.	Jew tagħmel dan.
I never have, I never will.	Qatt ma għandi, qatt ma se.
A very tired man.	Raġel għajjien ħafna.
I did so and more.	Jien għamilt hekk u aktar.
I have no idea why.	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex.
I was always eating.	Kont dejjem niekol.
But if you think so, fine.	Imma jekk taħseb hekk, tajjeb.
I had to think about it.	Kelli naħseb dwar dan.
It was the first time in a very long time.	Kienet l-ewwel darba għal żmien twil ħafna.
I like it a lot.	Inħobb ħafna.
He never came out.	Hu qatt ma ħareġ.
Just have fun.	Biss tieħu gost.
Sure, we don’t.	Żgur, m'għandniex.
Not for us.	Mhux għalina.
He was not.	Hu ma kienx.
And that was years ago.	U dan kien snin ilu.
She doesn’t do this often.	Hija ma tagħmilx dan spiss.
We almost know.	Kważi nafu.
That she can be.	Li hi tista 'tkun.
Or maybe you don’t want to appear.	Jew forsi ma tridx tidher.
That was someone else.	Dan kien xi ħadd ieħor.
I saw your work.	Rajt ix-xogħol tiegħek.
It was bad, but it sure is there.	Kien ħażin, imma żgur hemm.
You've been.	Int kont tkun.
I had heard about it.	Kont smajt dwarha.
And it doesn’t look so good anymore.	U ma jidhirx daqshekk tajjeb aktar.
Not until you tell me.	Mhux sakemm tgħidli.
Well, work is a good thing.	Ukoll, ix-xogħol huwa ħaġa tajba.
I'm sorry.	Jiddispjaċini .
It would have been so much easier that way.	Kien ikun daqshekk aktar faċli hekk.
But it looked good.	Imma kienet tidher tajba.
He will try something.	Huwa se jipprova xi ħaġa.
But she knew something.	Imma kienet taf xi ħaġa.
It was too late.	Kienet tard wisq.
I will try again tomorrow.	Se nerġa' nipprova għada.
He still can.	Għadu jista '.
And maybe he told me.	U forsi qalli.
Or maybe he was still waiting too long.	Jew forsi kien għadu jistenna wisq.
It's a lot of other things.	Huwa ħafna affarijiet oħra.
He appeared.	Huwa deher.
I'm going to do something.	Jien se nagħmel xi ħaġa.
So did everyone.	Hekk kellu kulħadd.
It’s too early to tell.	Huwa wisq kmieni biex tgħid.
In fact, she wants to see.	Fil-fatt, hi trid li jara.
I will talk soon.	Se nitkellem dalwaqt.
Well, that’s not quite what happens.	Ukoll, dan mhuwiex pjuttost dak li jiġri.
But the last thing.	Imma l-aħħar ħaġa.
Everyone came too.	Kulħadd daħal ukoll.
It will be hard to get back from that now.	Se jkun diffiċli li lura minn dak issa.
I go to my room.	Jien immur fil-kamra tiegħi.
Ask if anyone wanted to go back.	Staqsa jekk xi ħadd riedx imur lura.
You don’t have to be doing this.	Inti m'għandekx tkun qed tagħmel dan.
He doesn’t have to.	Huwa m'għandux għalfejn ikollu.
And someone died.	U xi ħadd miet.
She usually can.	Hija normalment tista '.
But he saw none of this.	Imma ma ra xejn minn dan.
Better man, if you will.	Raġel aħjar, jekk trid.
When you want.	Meta tixtieq.
He became a good friend.	Sar ħabib tajjeb.
For other people.	Għal nies oħra.
Always tell the truth.	Dejjem għid il-verità.
He was waiting.	Kien qed jistenna.
We knew that.	Konna dan.
He is your husband.	Huwa raġel tiegħek.
Time had passed.	Iż-żmien kien għadda.
I just know it happened.	Naf biss li ġara.
He couldn’t do it alone anymore.	Ma setax jagħmel dan waħdu aktar.
But it says nothing.	Imma ma tgħid xejn.
Often in fact.	Ħafna drabi fil-fatt.
He said nothing.	Ma qal xejn.
And this is another one.	U din hija waħda oħra.
Well, we're pretty there.	Ukoll, aħna qed pjuttost hemm.
Just doesn’t look good for a child.	Biss ma jidhirx tajjeb għal tifel.
The problem is the same.	Il-problema hija l-istess.
No, neither do you.	Le, lanqas int.
.	.
Or whatever you see.	Jew dak kollu li tara.
One is all we need.	Wieħed huwa dak kollu li għandna bżonn.
That’s a bad idea.	Dik hija idea ħażina.
it is not.	mhuwiex.
But we can know that will happen.	Imma nistgħu nafu li se jiġri.
But they are nothing.	Imma huma xejn.
That should be better.	Dak għandu jkun aħjar.
You have to.	Għandek .
I didn’t want to.	Jien ma ridtx.
They always are.	Dejjem huma.
I really hope so.	Tassew nittama li hekk.
I saw something.	Rajt xi ħaġa.
We don't have time.	M'għandniex ħin.
Not too late for me.	Mhux tard wisq għalija.
After that, that was it.	Wara dan, dak kien.
It is a problem.	Hija problema.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
This can be very overwhelming.	Dan jista 'jkun kbir ħafna.
I didn’t know.	Ma kontx naf.
All right !.	Kollox tajjeb!.
I don’t want to do too much of that.	Ma rridx nagħmel wisq minn hekk.
Which, might be a good idea.	Li, tista 'tkun idea tajba.
My little friend.	Ħabib żgħir tiegħi.
That took a long time.	Dak ħa ħafna żmien.
She loved everything.	Hija kienet iħobb kollox.
He was more than just one man.	Kien aktar minn raġel wieħed biss.
From.	Minn .
I'm a bit tired.	Jien daqsxejn għajjien.
I can do more than that.	Nista' nagħmel aktar minn hekk.
It’s no such thing.	Hu l-ebda ħaġa bħal din.
You are alone.	Inti waħdek.
It works on its own.	Jaħdem waħdu.
I wanted to know everything about her.	Ridt inkun naf kollox dwarha.
She was not there at the time.	Dak iż-żmien ma kinitx hemm.
Me too, but he does more.	Jien ukoll, imma hu jagħmel aktar.
I may be back later.	Nista’ nkun lura aktar tard.
And he said he didn’t know why.	U qal li ma kienx jaf għaliex.
It was his home.	Kienet id-dar tiegħu.
Not good for anyone.	Mhu tajjeb għal ħadd.
I was no longer alone.	Ma kontx aktar waħdi.
He didn’t have to be me all the time.	Ma kellux għalfejn inkun jien il-ħin kollu.
You see other people.	Inti tara nies oħra.
It was a long time to come.	Kien żmien twil biex ġej.
It was just him.	Kien hu biss.
I think you like both.	Naħseb li tixtieq it-tnejn.
She would have known.	Kieku kienet taf.
Or what he was thinking.	Jew dak li kien jaħseb.
Today, he is right.	Illum, għandu raġun.
It is more beautiful here.	Hija aktar sabiħa hawn.
As long as she is eating.	Sakemm hi qed tiekol.
That you must do well.	Li trid tagħmel ukoll.
I am completely sure of it.	Jiena ċert għal kollox dwarha.
It all came out now.	Dan kollu ħareġ issa.
You know what you are doing wrong.	Taf x'qed tagħmel ħażin.
I have been thinking a lot about it.	Ilni naħseb ħafna dwarha.
And, here we are again.	U, hawn aħna mill-ġdid.
Only one man was not surprised.	Raġel wieħed biss ma kienx sorpriż.
Which is not.	Li mhux.
This happened properly.	Dan ġara kif suppost.
Probably not fast enough for me.	Probabbilment mhux malajr biżżejjed għalija.
He is a very busy man.	Huwa raġel okkupat ħafna.
Really would.	Tassew kieku.
But it’s hard just after what I did.	Imma huwa diffiċli biss wara dak li għamilt.
But she can't tell what you see.	Imma hi ma tistax tgħid dak li tara.
Not that he was scared.	Mhux li kien jibża.
He said they were together.	Qal li kienu flimkien.
More and more and more.	Aktar u aktar u aktar.
You're hard to please.	Int diffiċli biex jekk jogħġbok.
Who was it.	Min kien.
I never knew about it.	Qatt ma kont naf dwar dan.
He wanted out.	Ried barra.
It can be.	Hija tista 'tkun.
It has a good job.	Għandu xogħol tajjeb.
He saw something more.	Huwa ra xi ħaġa aktar.
I’m really happy with that.	Jien tassew kuntent b'dan.
Everyone please help.	Kulħadd jekk jogħġbok jgħin.
He knew what was coming.	Kieku kien jaf x’kien ġej.
Someone will come.	Xi ħadd se jiġi.
As always, alone.	Bħal dejjem, waħdu.
Maybe we were both like that.	Forsi t-tnejn konna hekk.
I want to be there for everything.	Irrid inkun hemm għal kollox.
It will not happen again.	Mhux se jerġa’ jiġri.
But you better come as soon as possible.	Imma aħjar tiġi malajr kemm jista’ jkun.
No, very big.	Le, kbir ħafna.
And, he wants to have fun.	U, irid jieħu gost.
I will always tell the truth.	Jien dejjem se ngħid il-verità.
It was home.	Kienet id-dar.
Come here for a bit.	Ejja hawn għal ftit.
I didn’t have time to say anything.	Ma kellix ħin ngħid xejn.
Obviously he did.	Ovvjament hekk għamel.
She is home.	Hija d-dar.
I want to see what that is.	Irrid nara x'inhu dak.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Xejn nistgħu nagħmlu dwar dan.
That was easy work.	Dak kien ix-xogħol faċli.
I hope he is.	Nispera li se.
It wasn’t good at all.	Ma kien tajjeb xejn.
It's a lot of fun.	Huwa gost kbir.
But that’s where we are.	Imma dak huwa fejn aħna.
We never were.	Qatt ma konna.
It has never been more beautiful.	Qatt ma kienet aktar sabiħa.
I wasn’t me.	Jien ma kontx jien.
This should not be happening.	Dan m'għandux ikun qed jiġri.
I was too happy.	Jien kont kuntent wisq.
Really with you.	Tassew miegħek.
Everyone knows this, and there always is.	Kulħadd jaf dan, u dejjem hemm.
He was currently busy planning.	Bħalissa kien okkupat jippjana.
The, the, the u the.	Le, le, le u le.
I do everything he did.	Jien nagħmel dak kollu li għamel.
So we did.	Hekk għamilna.
This has never been a problem for us.	Din qatt ma kienet problema għalina.
Not everyone loves everything all the time.	Mhux kulħadd iħobb kollox il-ħin kollu.
She was after something.	Hija kienet wara xi ħaġa.
Maybe there was more to where it came from.	Forsi kien hemm aktar minn fejn ġie.
No, good.	Le, tajjeb.
There was, as always, no one there.	Ma kien hemm, bħal dejjem, ħadd hemmhekk.
You are never the same after that.	Inti qatt l-istess wara dak.
You know that.	Inti taf li.
None of this could have happened.	Xejn minn dan seta’ ġara.
Everyone has three friends.	Kulħadd għandu tliet ħbieb.
That's not me.	Dak mhux jien.
Everything is ready to go now.	Kollox lest biex imur issa.
You already have a problem.	Diġà għandek problema.
I really wish I was here.	Nixtieq tassew li kont hawn.
She wants to know.	Hija trid tkun taf.
She didn't know what to do.	Hija ma kinitx taf x'se tagħmel.
I want to do this for him.	Irrid nagħmel dan għalih.
It's probably too late now.	Probabbilment huwa tard wisq issa.
I would say it is wrong.	Jien ngħid li huwa ħażin.
But none of that.	Imma xejn ta’ dan.
Long chance there.	Ċans twil hemm.
I still can't understand.	Għadni ma nistax nifhem.
I have said this many times.	Dan għidt ħafna drabi.
He saw me, and quickly on.	Huwa ra lili, u malajr fuq.
There is no way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod.
Work is still too early for this.	Ix-xogħol għadu kmieni wisq għal dan.
That was nothing.	Dak ma kien xejn.
he asked.	staqsa.
We really do.	Aħna verament nagħmlu.
He is always saying so.	Dejjem qed jgħid hekk.
I’m glad you can be.	Jien ferħan li tista' tiġi.
It was not easy.	Hija ma kinitx faċli.
She will do it for me.	Hija se tagħmel dan għalija.
You know what you're doing.	Taf x’qed tagħmel.
No one has done anything like that.	Ħadd ma għamel xi ħaġa bħal din.
He wants to go back to the room.	Irid imur lura fil-kamra.
He would have to actually do something about his one.	Huwa jkollu fil-fatt jagħmel xi ħaġa dwar wieħed tiegħu.
I think a lot not.	Naħseb ħafna li le.
She would not think.	Hija ma kinitx se taħseb.
That’s not what he wanted.	Dan mhux dak li ried.
But you can tell.	Imma tista' tgħid.
But here’s what we know.	Imma hawn dak li nafu.
He will be with us soon.	Hu ser ikun magħna dalwaqt.
The same thing happened to me.	L-istess ġara lili.
This he knew too well.	Dan kien jaf wisq tajjeb.
Someone knows something.	Xi ħadd jaf xi ħaġa.
Well, there's a man.	Ukoll, hemm raġel.
You never know who you might be.	Qatt ma tkun taf min seta’ kont.
It’s not much, he thought.	Mhuwiex ħafna, ħaseb.
We knew that.	Aħna konna nafu dan.
I definitely didn’t want to.	Żgur li ma ridtx.
She can't speak.	Hija ma tistax titkellem.
He knew what to do.	Kien jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
I wanted to be out there so badly.	Ridt inkun hemm barra daqshekk ħażin.
I have never heard that before.	Qatt ma smajt dik qabel.
She needed more time.	Hija kellha bżonn aktar ħin.
You just told me that.	Inti biss qalli li.
But he wanted more.	Imma ried aktar.
He had taken everything wrong.	Huwa kien ħa kollox ħażin.
Good too.	Tajjeb ukoll.
I want to.	Irrid.
We are definitely doing that.	Żgur li qed nagħmlu hekk.
They were just friends.	Kienu biss ħbieb.
I was small.	Kont żgħir.
Don’t talk like that.	M'għandekx titkellem hekk.
Well, it's there.	Ukoll, huwa hemm.
It came to me from behind.	Ġie għandi minn wara.
He has no idea what it is.	M’għandux idea x’inhu.
He looked home.	Huwa ħares id-dar.
Everyone knows someone who knows someone.	Kulħadd jaf lil xi ħadd li jaf lil xi ħadd.
It's work.	Huwa xogħol.
Before you know it.	Qabel ma tkun taf.
I didn’t think about any of this.	Jien ma ħsibt dwar xejn minn dan.
It had been a long time.	Kien ilu għal żmien twil.
I’m not entirely sure about that.	M'inix ċert għal kollox dwar dan.
We can only do what we can do.	Nistgħu nagħmlu biss dak li nistgħu nagħmlu.
I wish he was here.	Nixtieq li kien hawn.
You can, you know.	Tista', taf.
I was glad I was there.	Kont ferħan li kont hemm.
But there are other times that don’t.	Imma hemm drabi oħra li le.
It doesn’t have to be.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun.
And maybe he can.	U forsi jista’.
It's not hard to do.	Mhuwiex diffiċli li tagħmel.
And it was going well.	U kien sejjer tajjeb.
Just the door.	Il-bieb biss.
It would be.	Kieku tkun .
What happened? ' 	X'ġara?'
Everything else is great.	Kollox ieħor huwa kbir.
Things to see.	Affarijiet biex tara.
I think he bought that.	Naħseb li xtara dak.
We will do something about it tomorrow.	Se nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwarha għada.
I loved him very much.	Kont inħobb ħafna miegħu.
There is no good way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod tajjeb.
Time had never looked good.	Iż-żmien qatt ma kien deher tajjeb.
Not really sure.	Mhux tassew ċert.
This is quite as it should be.	Dan huwa pjuttost kif għandu jkun.
I'm glad he is.	Jien kuntent li hu.
He was right about that.	Huwa kellu raġun fuq dan.
I think he can do that.	Naħseb li jista 'jagħmel dan.
Everything was there, for sure.	Dak kollu kien hemm, żgur.
We know a lot, lately.	Nafu ħafna, dan l-aħħar.
Everyone was gone.	Kulħadd kien telaq.
How easy! 	Kemm faċli!
In fact, better.	Fil-fatt, aħjar.
He agreed to do so.	Huwa qabel li jagħmel dan.
We are many.	Aħna ħafna.
Who knows why it wasn’t.	Min jaf għaliex ma kienx.
He knew what he was going to do today.	Kien jaf x’kien se jkollu jagħmel illum.
They all do that, too.	Huma kollha jagħmlu dan, ukoll.
She knew she wasn’t.	Kienet taf li ma kinitx.
The problem I have.	Il-problema jien.
I think it will do.	Naħseb li se tagħmel.
Not quite, really.	Mhux pjuttost, tassew.
This happened to me.	Dan ġara lili.
I did everything.	Għamilt dak kollu.
To tell the truth.	Biex ngħid il-verità.
I was always there for you.	Dejjem kont hemm għalik.
Plus it was great.	Barra minn hekk kien kbir.
We had a good time doing this.	Kellna żmien tajjeb nagħmlu dan.
But it wasn’t too good either.	Imma lanqas ma kienet tajba wisq.
That was the first.	Dik kienet l-ewwel.
But there will be one.	Imma se jkun hemm waħda.
But a few things were.	Imma ftit affarijiet kienu.
Still.	Għadha.
Nothing was seen there.	Xejn ma kien jidher hemmhekk.
Nothing like that happened.	Ma ġara hekk xejn.
I should have done it so long ago.	I kellha għamilt hekk twil ilu.
Maybe a little.	Forsi ftit.
Everyone knows everyone.	Kulħadd jaf lil kulħadd.
He will be back.	Hu se jkun lura.
It had to be you.	Kellha tkun int.
Everything is happening again.	Kollox qed jerġa’ jiġri.
Easy for some people.	Faċli għal xi nies.
It was only very late that evening.	Wasal biss tard ħafna dik il-lejla.
This was not, of course, as it should have been.	Dan ma kienx, ovvjament, kif suppost kellha tkun.
That should do it, he thought.	Dan għandu jagħmel dan, ħaseb.
It's not that it can't happen.	Mhuwiex li jista 'ma jiġri.
As it was not.	Kif ma kienx.
I couldn’t take much more.	Ma stajtx nieħu ħafna aktar.
We can't go back.	Ma nistgħux lura.
No one knows anything about it.	Ħadd ma jaf xejn dwarha.
It seems that.	Jidher li.
More than that.	Aktar minn dan.
Early in the afternoon.	Kmieni wara nofsinhar.
It’s all mine.	Hija kollox tiegħi.
It’s time too.	Wasal iż-żmien ukoll.
Same car as before.	L-istess karozza minn qabel.
I believe that.	Nemmen li .
Knowing is better than not knowing.	Li tkun taf huwa aħjar milli ma tkunx taf.
I would be fine.	Inkun tajjeb.
It will be good now.	Se jkun tajjeb issa.
But this is good for me.	Imma dan huwa tajjeb għalija.
And probably.	I probabbilment.
Now, here are the things you need to know.	Issa, hawn huma l-affarijiet li għandek bżonn tkun taf.
Now, maybe that’s a good thing.	Issa, forsi dik hija ħaġa tajba.
Today he had one school.	Illum kellu wieħed l-iskola.
I had never been to one before.	Qatt ma kont ġejt għal waħda qabel.
I had no one else.	Ma kelli lil ħadd ieħor.
And that's really what.	U dak huwa verament dak.
I will always know where he is.	Jien dejjem inkun naf fejn hu.
But there are problems.	Imma hemm problemi.
It was great fun.	Kien gost kbir.
It can be quite difficult.	Jista 'jkun pjuttost diffiċli.
You can do that, too.	Inti tista 'tagħmel dan, ukoll.
I don’t know, but maybe you are.	Ma nafx, imma forsi inti.
Not much time has passed at all.	Ma għadda ħafna ħin għal kollox.
I’ll tell you another thing.	Jien ser ngħidlek ħaġa oħra.
Going back home.	Tmur lura d-dar.
He was on one, too.	Huwa kien fuq wieħed, ukoll.
We have to go.	Irridu mmorru.
A good thing happened here.	Ħaġa tajba ġara hawn.
Usually, it's not.	Normalment, mhuwiex.
So everyone wins.	Hekk jirbaħ kulħadd.
We were doing well and everyone would be happy.	Konna mmorru tajjeb u kulħadd ikun kuntent.
I did the same.	Jien għamilt l-istess.
Not me, he wanted to say, ever me.	Mhux jien, ried jgħid, qatt jien.
Now, you think wrong here.	Issa, taħseb ħażin hawn.
I can’t eat much right now.	Ma nistax niekol ħafna bħalissa.
You don’t have to go together.	M'għandekx għalfejn tmur flimkien.
It could be a few hours.	Jista 'jkun ftit sigħat.
In fact, it was more.	Fil-fatt, kien aktar.
I still believe that.	Għadni nemmen li.
This is probably a good thing.	Din hija probabbilment ħaġa tajba.
You need more than that.	Għandek bżonn aktar minn hekk.
So were you.	Hekk kont int.
That was enough for both of us.	Dan kien biżżejjed għalina t-tnejn.
Now he does.	Issa hu ma.
The time was too late.	Il-ħin kien tard wisq.
Really, almost everything will work.	Tassew, kważi kollox se jaħdem.
And it was a good thing.	U kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
Or maybe they are.	Jew forsi huma.
Not one year.	Mhux sena waħda.
He didn’t seem to be waiting.	Ma deherx qed jistenna.
Wherever he is, he can see everything.	Minn fejn ikun, jista’ jara kollox.
It was as she knew it would be.	Kien kif kienet taf li se jkun.
It was never a good idea.	Qatt ma kienet idea tajba.
Great for you.	Kbir għalik.
Nothing is ever right.	Xejn mhu qatt tajjeb.
I'm surprised you do.	Jien sorpriż li tagħmel.
It’s happening so early to so many people now.	Qed jiġri hekk kmieni lil tant nies issa.
Not sure how to do it.	Mhux ċert kif tagħmel dan.
It was nothing but.	Kien xejn imma.
He has to buy what he has to do.	Huwa għandu jixtri dak li għandu jagħmel.
It's very fast.	Huwa malajr ħafna.
You have to do what works for you.	Int trid tagħmel dak li jaħdem għalik.
It was late and she was tired.	Kien tard u kienet għajjien.
And of course he didn’t.	U ovvjament ma kienx jagħmel.
Most people.	Ħafna nies.
Try again.	Ipprova għal darba oħra.
Everything can be good enough.	Kollox jista 'jkun tajjeb biżżejjed.
There is nothing you can do now.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel issa.
What we did wasn’t even enough.	Dak li għamilna lanqas kien biżżejjed.
That was no small task.	Dak ma kienx xogħol żgħir.
I don’t want that for you.	Ma rridx dak għalik.
Or rather, so it will be.	Jew aħjar, hekk se tkun.
They felt it all.	Ħassu ma’ dan kollu.
I'm so scared.	Jien tant nibża'.
Like he had gone to sit or something.	Bħal hu kien mar joqgħod jew xi ħaġa.
We have to be fast.	Irridu nkunu malajr.
That's ready.	Dak lest.
That’s what happens around here.	Dak hu li jiġri madwar hawn.
It does nothing for nothing.	Ma jagħmel xejn għal xejn.
Great as fun.	Kbir daqs gost.
One chance, and only one chance.	Ċans wieħed, u ċans wieħed biss.
Not as it was.	Mhux kif kien.
He didn’t have much to say about it.	Ma kellux ħafna xi jgħid dwar dan.
We know they were there.	Nafu li kienu hemm.
I hope you do.	Nispera li tagħmel dan.
We have a pretty good idea of ​​where he is.	Għandna idea pjuttost tajba fejn hu.
You can be good with everything.	Inti tista 'tkun tajjeb ma' dak kollu.
Now you're there.	Issa int hemm.
I never really did.	Jien qatt ma verament għamilt.
We were home.	Konna d-dar.
And he’s good.	U hu tajjeb.
I thought it would.	Ħsibt li kieku.
But not as bad as anyone had thought.	Imma mhux ħażin daqs kemm kien ħaseb xi ħadd.
Always me, and they are.	Dejjem jien, u huma.
It seems that this is.	Jidher li dan hu.
He will come for us.	Hu se jiġi għalina.
It won’t be a year.	Mhux se tkun sena.
I’m not here to try anything.	Jien m'iniex hawn biex nipprova xejn.
He had said too much.	Huwa kien qal wisq.
Or, something like that.	Jew, xi ħaġa bħal dik.
Everything else looked good.	Kollox ieħor deher tajjeb.
Neither is he.	Lanqas hu.
It has not always been so.	Mhux dejjem kien hekk.
You have done many things for us.	Int għamilt ħafna affarijiet għalina.
I think that would be a good idea.	Naħseb li tkun idea tajba.
He was a boy, really.	Kien tifel, tassew.
In addition.	Barra minn hekk.
Australia wants it now.	L-Awstralja trid hekk issa.
This is not what we are.	Dan mhux dak li aħna.
I will say this again.	Jien se nerġa' ngħid dan.
It could be this week.	Jista’ jkun din il-ġimgħa.
Not all good.	Ma jkunx tajjeb kollu.
I recently went home.	Dan l-aħħar mort mort id-dar.
But just me.	Imma jien biss.
This could have happened to anyone.	Dan seta' ġara lil xi ħadd.
Just stay where you are.	Biss toqgħod fejn int.
I like to think.	Inħobb naħseb.
It should not be here.	M'għandux ikun hawn.
I have a lot of work to do.	Għandi ħafna xogħol.
It was very difficult for us.	Kien diffiċli ħafna għalina.
This could not be done by just one person.	Dan ma setax isir minn persuna waħda biss.
Well, that's easy.	Ukoll, dan huwa faċli.
It's easier.	Huwa aktar faċli.
Sometimes it takes years before you know it.	Xi drabi tieħu snin qabel ma tkun taf.
I can’t really do that.	Ma nistax verament tagħmel dan.
It's just fun.	Huwa biss gost.
But of course we do.	Imma ovvjament nagħmlu.
Something was wrong above.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina hawn fuq.
It's at work.	Huwa fuq ix-xogħol.
I never have time.	Qatt ma għandi ħin.
He wasn’t sure if he could do it.	Ma kienx ċert jekk setax jagħmel dan.
Not ever, probably.	Mhux qatt, probabbilment.
You can't go back.	Ma tistax tmur lura.
Maybe so he was thinking.	Forsi hekk kien qed jaħseb.
No one outside knows she is here.	Ħadd barra ma jaf li hi hawn.
Maybe she was planning that.	Forsi kienet qed tippjana li.
I just want everything to work.	Irrid biss li kollox jaħdem.
I would like a lot of help to make this work properly.	Nixtieq ħafna għajnuna biex dan jaħdem kif suppost.
It was time for another.	Kien wasal iż-żmien għal ieħor.
There comes a time when enough is enough.	Jasal żmien meta biżżejjed huwa biżżejjed.
But we are not the car.	Imma aħna mhux il-karozza.
Not as bad as you think.	Mhux daqshekk ħażin kif taħseb.
You will do this for me.	Inti se tagħmel dan għalija.
You can do as you please.	Tista' tagħmel kif trid.
It was hard to take that time.	Kien diffiċli li tieħu dak iż-żmien.
There was no more time.	Ma kienx hemm aktar ħin.
She was going to eat.	Kienet se tiekol.
But not everyone will.	Imma mhux kulħadd se.
Someone wants to know the truth.	Xi ħadd irid ikun jaf il-verità.
Sorry for that.	Jiddispjaċini għal dan.
Not just you.	Mhux int biss.
I was always too scared.	Dejjem kont nibża’ wisq.
That’s good for us.	Dak tajjeb għalina.
But it certainly wasn’t the last.	Imma żgur li ma kienx l-aħħar.
He needed to make sure.	Huwa kellu bżonn jagħmel ċert.
He can live here.	Huwa jista 'jgħix hawn.
I can’t tell you more than that now.	Ma nistax ngħidlek aktar minn hekk issa.
That’s not what I’m talking about.	Dak mhux jien nitkellem.
He did more than that.	Għamel aktar minn hekk.
Something more than that is not good.	Xi ħaġa aktar minn hekk mhix tajba.
But who knows.	Imma min jaf.
That's worth thinking about.	Dak ta’ min jaħseb.
To another man.	Lil raġel ieħor.
It's almost too easy.	Huwa kważi faċli wisq.
Or was it something more.	Jew kienet xi ħaġa aktar.
It may very well be.	Hija tajjeb ħafna tista 'tkun.
It was very easy to do.	Kien faċli ħafna li tagħmel.
That's very fast.	Li malajr ħafna.
Anyone can do it.	Kulħadd jista 'jagħmel dan.
It was too late to do anything else.	Kien tard wisq biex tagħmel xi ħadd ieħor.
There was no one there.	Ma kien hemm ħadd hemmhekk.
There is a lot of time.	Hemm ħafna ħin.
You are a good boy.	Inti tifel tajjeb.
But it does nothing.	Imma ma jagħmel xejn.
There was nothing really, nothing for anyone.	Ma kien hemm xejn verament, xejn għal ħadd.
I know he will do the same for you.	Naf li se tagħmel l-istess għalik.
But he seemed very happy.	Imma deher li kien kuntent ħafna.
I can definitely see that.	Żgur li nista' nara dan.
School is much easier.	L-iskola hija ħafna aktar faċli.
It should do whatever you want.	Għandu jagħmel dak kollu li trid.
They will do something about it.	Huma ser jagħmlu xi ħaġa dwar dan.
Loved making out.	Iħobb jagħmel barra.
That was good of me.	Li kien tajjeb minni.
You do the same thing.	Inti tagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
I'm still young.	Għadni żgħir.
But it seems you are too.	Imma jidher li int ukoll.
Not easy, that's for sure.	Mhux faċli, dan żgur.
Maybe one thing I’ve done.	Forsi ħaġa waħda li stajt għamilt.
I love my home.	Inħobb id-dar tiegħi.
From this he was now certain.	Minn dan issa kien ċert.
I don’t think I’ll try.	Ma naħseb li nipprova.
And very worried.	U inkwetat ħafna.
But he hadn’t told anyone why.	Imma ma kien qal lil ħadd għaliex.
So they did.	Hekk kienu jagħmlu.
Just on and on and on.	Biss fuq u fuq u fuq.
I never thought of that.	Jien qatt ma ħsibt minn hekk.
I don't want to hear that again.	Ma rridx nerġa’ nisma’ hekk.
The door arrives.	Jasal il-bieb.
Don’t do it and do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan u tagħmel dak.
But maybe there.	Imma forsi hemmhekk.
Everyone seemed to be waiting.	Kulħadd deher jistenna.
That actually wasn’t the whole truth either.	Dik fil-fatt ma kinitx il-verità kollha lanqas.
He asked around.	Huwa staqsa madwar.
Help will come.	L-għajnuna se tiġi.
It’s a good thing he already knows so much.	Hija ħaġa tajba li diġà jaf daqshekk.
They really do that.	Huma verament jagħmlu dan.
So bad.	Hekk hu ħażin.
They are there.	Huma hemmhekk.
And it happens fast.	U jiġri malajr.
And so we did.	U hekk għamilna.
He didn’t want to know, either.	Hu ma riedx ikun jaf, lanqas.
I'm home now.	Jien id-dar issa.
That’s good there.	Dak tajjeb hemm.
I didn’t do anything wrong.	Jien ma għamilt xejn ħażin.
It's just easier that way.	Huwa biss aktar faċli hekk.
More and more today.	Aktar u aktar illum.
You have to do it.	Trid tagħmel dan.
I know a few other people like that as well.	Naf ftit nies oħra bħal din ukoll.
And he didn’t want to.	U ma riedx.
I don’t know enough.	Ma nafx biżżejjed.
No, please no.	Le, jekk jogħġbok le.
Try everything.	Ipprova kollox.
Just all wrong.	Biss kollox ħażin.
They were too tired.	Kienu għajjien wisq.
She knows where.	Hi taf fejn.
He probably knew everything.	Probabbilment kien jaf kollox.
You are very good to me.	Int tajjeb ħafna miegħi.
I can be anyone.	Jien nista' nkun xi ħadd.
Really great work.	Xogħol kbir tassew.
She was already home.	Kienet diġà d-dar.
But it was, at the time.	Imma kien, dak iż-żmien.
That’s not a bad idea.	Dik mhix idea ħażina.
Not even a friend.	Lanqas ħabib.
First, he had work to do.	L-ewwel, kellu xogħol xi jagħmel.
It does that too.	Jagħmel dan ukoll.
And so it seemed.	U hekk deher.
Don't be late.	Tkunx tard.
It was good again.	Kien tajjeb mill-ġdid.
I have never had this problem before.	Qatt ma kelli din il-problema qabel.
There is more, too.	Hemm aktar, ukoll.
I never tell anyone about it.	Qatt ma ngħid lil ħadd dwarha.
He had a great time.	Kellu ħafna ħin.
There was nothing there.	Ma kien hemm xejn hemmhekk.
Before anything happened.	Qabel ma ġara xejn.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
One will be fine.	Wieħed se jkun tajjeb.
I'm not sure.	M'inix ċert.
This may be the first.	Dan jista 'jkun l-ewwel.
And a lot of friends, too.	U ħafna ħbieb, ukoll.
Not so much anymore.	Mhux hekk aktar.
He still does that.	Għadu jagħmel dan.
I'm here if you need anything.	Jien hawn jekk għandek bżonn xi ħaġa.
It's still mine.	Għadu tiegħi.
He does that.	Huwa jagħmel dak.
Well, you are not.	Ukoll, m'intix.
He knew this for sure.	Huwa kien jaf dan żgur.
I've been waiting.	Stajt nistenna.
Look out.	Ħares barra.
That's good with us.	Dak tajjeb magħna.
You are doing too much.	Int qed tagħmel wisq.
And how much you want to know.	U kemm trid tkun taf.
But we did nothing.	Imma ma għamilna xejn.
Of a friend.	Ta’ ħabib.
That’s his whole thing.	Dik hija ħaġa kollha tiegħu.
This is working very well.	Dan qed jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
It wasn’t much to see.	Ma kienx ħafna x'tara.
That would be me.	Dak inkun jien.
Everything was done well.	Kollox sar tajjeb.
And he’s not a bad man, really.	U hu mhux raġel ħażin, tassew.
Maybe it's just me.	Forsi li jien biss.
And really, almost no one actually died.	U tassew, kważi ħadd fil-fatt miet.
I like a good time.	Inħobb ħin tajjeb.
Why it happened.	Għaliex ġara.
I was a bit tired as well.	Jien kont daqsxejn għajjien ukoll.
And it was wrong.	U kien ħażin.
But it wasn’t, not quite.	Imma ma kienx, mhux pjuttost.
She was.	Hija kienet .
She knew what was coming next.	Kienet taf x’kien ġej wara.
No, he's not.	Le, hu mhux.
I think you already know this.	Naħseb li diġà taf dan.
We have very little time.	Ftit li xejn għandna ħin.
In fact, they already are.	Fil-fatt, diġà huma.
I hope you can do that.	Nittama li tista 'tagħmel dan.
It's a good fit.	Huwa tajjeb tajjeb.
It was going well.	Kien sejjer tajjeb.
Or maybe not bad.	Jew forsi mhux ħażin.
She didn't, of course.	Hija ma, ovvjament.
Little did he know.	Ftit li xejn kien jaf.
Or maybe all of the above and more.	Jew forsi dak kollu ta 'hawn fuq u aktar.
But he couldn't say no.	Imma lanqas seta’ jgħid le.
Everything can wait.	Kollox jista’ jistenna.
Maybe it was the same.	Forsi kien l-istess.
I don't think so.	Ma 'naħsibx .
He was almost dead today.	Hu kien kważi miet illum.
You are taking it now.	Int qed tieħu issa.
He thinks it’s really bad for you.	Huwa jaħseb li huwa tassew ħażin għalik.
About everything, really.	Dwar kollox, tassew.
I wondered what he was really thinking.	Stajt naħseb x’kien qed jaħseb tassew.
It needs to be seen.	Jeħtieġ li wieħed jara.
How can that be? 	Kif jista’ jkun?
I can tell you one thing.	Nista’ ngħidlek ħaġa waħda.
Look back at the door.	Ħares lura lejn il-bieb.
So be it.	Hekk suppost tkun.
I heard nothing.	Ma smajt xejn.
It’s still early here.	Għadu kmieni hawn.
Now of course.	Issa ovvjament.
These may have been more, but there was no time.	Dawn seta’ kien aktar, imma ma kienx hemm ħin.
She was no longer a child.	Ma kinitx għadha tifel.
I was so tired and all.	Jien kont tant għajjien u kollox.
No, really, do it.	Le, tassew, tagħmel dan.
They probably are.	Probabbilment huma.
I can never do that.	Qatt ma nista’ nagħmel hekk.
You, you’re too young.	Int, int żgħir wisq.
It’s me, but it’s not mine.	Jien jien, imma mhux tiegħi.
But for me, not for you.	Imma għalija, mhux għalik.
But they are always, always the same people.	Imma huma dejjem, dejjem l-istess nies.
I wasn’t thinking about anything.	Ma kont qed naħseb dwar xejn.
What it was, it was.	Dak li kien, kien.
There was just something so beautiful.	Kien hemm biss xi ħaġa sabiħa ħafna.
And that’s just great.	U dan huwa biss kbir.
I’m not that small.	Jien mhux daqshekk żgħir.
I want you to come.	Nixtieq li inti tiġi.
You want to be alone.	Trid waħdek.
This is not actually hard to do.	Dan mhux fil-fatt diffiċli li tagħmel.
I think they felt really bad.	Naħseb li ħassu tassew ħażin.
Now there isn’t.	Issa mhux hemm.
He was definitely trying.	Huwa żgur li kien qed jipprova.
I was doing the same thing.	Jien kont nagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
I really like that time.	Verament inħobb dak iż-żmien.
This will not do.	Dan mhux se jagħmel.
He was here a few times.	Kien hawn xi ftit drabi.
He knew nothing about the book.	Ma kien jaf xejn dwar il-ktieb.
It was really beautiful.	Kienet tassew sabiħa.
I’m not supposed to talk to him.	Jien mhux suppost nitkellem miegħu.
Great boy.	Tifel kbir.
Always do.	Dejjem jagħmlu.
Time is not what it seems to be.	Iż-żmien mhuwiex dak li jidher li hu.
I'm a little worried.	Jien xi ftit inkwetat.
We always had a really good time.	Dejjem kellna ħin tassew tajjeb.
It does so much.	Jagħmel hekk ħafna.
Couldn’t wait to try his first one !.	Ma setax jistenna li jipprova l-ewwel wieħed tiegħu!.
I will do that.	Jien se nagħmel dan.
This should work well.	Dan għandu jaħdem tajjeb.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
I had to believe.	Kelli nemmen.
He wasn’t sure why, but he did.	Ma kienx ċert għaliex, imma hekk għamel.
It is too early to go home.	Għadu kmieni biex tmur id-dar.
Neither do we.	U lanqas aħna.
I will take everything.	Se nieħu kollox.
I can't see any other way.	Ma nista' nara l-ebda mod ieħor.
I have known for years.	Ilni snin naf.
You know what you always say.	Taf dak li dejjem tgħid.
I can prove it works.	Nista' nipprova li dan jaħdem.
And many other people.	U ħafna nies oħra.
Or it could be something else entirely.	Jew tista 'tkun xi ħaġa oħra għal kollox.
It’s time to talk.	Wasal iż-żmien li titkellem.
I’m not so sure it will be.	M'inix daqshekk ċert li se jkun.
How do you do.	Kif tagħmel int.
But maybe you’re doing something else.	Imma forsi qed tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
He agreed with me.	Huwa qabel miegħi.
He knew it too.	Kien jaf ukoll.
How hard is it ?.	Kemm hu diffiċli?.
It looks great.	Jidher kbir.
And there is something else.	U hemm ħaġa oħra.
Everything is one for us.	Kollox huwa wieħed għalina.
I have nothing.	Jien ma għandi xejn.
You can't stand it.	Ma tistax toqgħod.
But we had to know.	Imma kellna nafu.
Well, it's not working.	Ukoll, mhux qed jaħdem.
I think there was more.	Naħseb li kien hemm aktar.
I know one thing.	Naf ħaġa waħda.
He was living like before.	Kien qed jgħix bħal qabel.
I was wrong.	Kont ħażin.
It was all she knew.	Kien dak kollu li kienet taf.
Maybe there is more.	Forsi hemm aktar.
the.	le.
Do it or don’t.	Tagħmel dan jew ma tagħmilx.
I wanted to be good.	Ridt inkun tajjeb.
I have an idea.	Għandi idea.
And this is something.	U din hija xi ħaġa.
Not too small.	Mhux żgħir wisq.
The same time we are.	L-istess ħin aħna.
Obviously we have.	Ovvjament għandna.
I’m happier now more than ever.	Jien aktar kuntent issa aktar minn qatt qabel.
Too, too fast.	Wisq, malajr wisq.
In my room.	Fil-kamra tiegħi.
You don’t need to know what it is.	M'għandekx bżonn tkun taf x'inhu.
I thought back quickly.	Ħsibt lura malajr.
It's for everyone.	Huwa għal kulħadd.
We don’t need to.	M'għandniex bżonn.
Do you think you do.	Taħseb li tagħmel.
How are you.	Kif int.
You do exactly the same thing.	Inti tagħmel eżatt l-istess ħaġa.
But what was.	Imma dak li kien.
But he went.	Imma huwa mar.
You don’t need to do anything big about it.	M'għandekx bżonn tagħmel xi ħaġa kbira dwarha.
It’s really good for almost anything.	Huwa tassew tajjeb għal kważi kull ħaġa.
There is something out there for everyone.	Hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk għal kulħadd.
Now let’s get to that.	Issa ejja għal dan.
I need to tell you before I go.	Għandi bżonn ngħidlek qabel immur.
All good and glad.	Kollox tajjeb u ferħan.
I have to be home.	Għandi nkun id-dar.
That's it.	Dak hu.
He did more.	Huwa għamel aktar.
Or it will work well.	Jew se jaħdem tajjeb.
I did a little bit of everything.	Għamilt ftit minn kollox.
This is where it started.	Dan huwa fejn beda.
It is for everyone that it can be.	Huwa għal kulħadd li jista 'jiġi.
It's been a long time.	Għadda żmien twil.
As many know.	Kif jaf li ħafna.
Not too late.	Mhux tard wisq.
We don’t do any of that.	Aħna ma nagħmlu l-ebda waħda.
He didn’t have to do that.	Huwa ma kellux jagħmel dan.
To do this is another.	Li tagħmel dan huwa ieħor.
It was a long time coming.	Kien żmien twil ġej.
First, he may be right.	L-ewwel, jista 'jkollu raġun.
I think I can’t say in advance.	Naħseb li ma nistax ngħid minn qabel.
We are almost home.	Aħna kważi d-dar.
He lived alone.	Kien jgħix waħdu.
And you know, it wasn’t like that either.	U taf, lanqas ma kien hekk.
If he is as good as he is.	Jekk hu tajjeb li hu.
They were not going to do anything.	Ma kienu se jagħmlu xejn.
Too late, and she knew it.	Tard wisq, u kienet taf.
Not tonight, maybe ever.	Mhux illejla, forsi qatt.
I can’t speak from outside of that.	Ma nistax nitkellem minn barra minn hekk.
I almost did.	Kważi għamilt.
It looks like everything is there.	Qisu kollox hemm.
No, that would have been too easy.	Le, dan kien ikun faċli wisq.
No one else was here.	Ħadd ieħor ma kien hawn.
It is this book.	Huwa dan il-ktieb.
I want to be there.	Irrid inkun hemm.
There was something behind it.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa lura.
That's pretty.	Dak huwa pjuttost.
I know it will.	Naf li se.
Everyone had to go.	Kulħadd kellu jmur.
He probably should have known better.	Probabbilment kellu jkun jaf aħjar.
You’re still not big enough to do that.	Għadek m'intix kbir biżżejjed biex tagħmel dan.
I want to try it myself.	Irrid nipprova jien.
Or thought she did.	Jew ħaseb li għamlet.
But of course he did.	Imma ovvjament hekk għamel.
It wasn’t small.	Ma kienx żgħir.
This will do no more.	Dan mhux se jagħmel aktar.
But you are not.	Imma m'intix.
Good thing this shouldn’t happen again.	Ħaġa tajba li dan m'għandux jiġri aktar.
It happens from time to time.	Jiġri minn żmien għal żmien.
Maybe he is doing both ?.	Forsi qed jagħmel it-tnejn?.
Or maybe he is.	Jew forsi hu.
You will only speak.	Int biss se titkellem.
It could go wrong tonight.	Jista’ jmur ħażin illejla.
It definitely seems to take a lot of time.	Żgur jidher li jieħu ħafna ħin.
You can do anything.	Tista' tagħmel xi ħaġa.
They will not do this for me.	Huma mhux se jagħmlu dan għalija.
Nothing is here.	Xejn mhu hawn.
It’s a great one for me.	Huwa wieħed kbir għalija.
But that's not it.	Imma dak mhux.
He went back to school.	Huwa mar lura l-iskola.
It wasn’t there, of course.	Ma kienx hemm, ovvjament.
I’m not really a talking person.	Jien mhux verament persuna li titkellem.
I am sure.	Jiena żgur.
I’m not surprised about that.	Jien mhux sorpriż dwar dan.
This is how and why.	Dan huwa kif u għaliex.
In fact I hardly do so anymore.	Fil-fatt ma tantx nagħmel hekk aktar.
I wasn’t there.	Jien ma kontx hemm.
Now she had to.	Issa kellha.
It was some time ago.	Kien xi żmien ilu.
We do what we have to do.	Aħna nagħmlu dak li għandna nagħmlu.
I would love to hear how it goes for you.	Nixtieq nisma' kif tmur għalik.
I had no idea what it was.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea x'kien.
And maybe we had.	U forsi kellna.
If you’re good, you’re good.	Jekk int tajjeb, int tajjeb.
I'm so good.	Jien tajjeb hekk.
He could hardly speak.	Ma tantx seta’ jitkellem.
That’s not a bad thing, either.	Dik mhix xi ħaġa ħażina, lanqas.
It’s harder for me.	Huwa aktar diffiċli għalija.
She wasn’t supposed to.	Hija ma kinitx suppost.
It's easy going.	Huwa faċli tmur.
But she did little.	Imma ma tantx għamlet.
I needed time to think.	Kelli bżonn żmien biex naħseb.
It's money again.	Huwa flus mill-ġdid.
Easy couldn't be.	Faċli ma setax ikun.
It should arrive soon.	Għandu jasal dalwaqt.
That was happy.	Dak kien kuntent.
There is a way.	Hemm mod.
That's what they really have to do.	Dak hu li verament għandhom jagħmlu.
The only one actually.	L-unika waħda fil-fatt.
I don’t know what the exact time will be.	Ma nafx x'se jkun iż-żmien eżatt.
It has been working all morning.	Ilu kollu filgħodu jaħdem.
And you know, it probably was.	U taf, probabbilment kien.
Now, it never will.	Issa, qatt ma se.
You do everything on your own.	Inti tagħmel kollox waħdek.
He will have to go.	Huwa ser ikollu jmur.
I am all the time.	Jien il-ħin kollu.
We have it all !.	Għandna dan kollu!.
No one ever knew there were people here.	Ħadd qatt ma kien jaf li hawn nies.
He never came out.	Hu qatt ma ħareġ.
He who he is.	Hu min hu.
We did a good thing here.	Għamilna ħaġa tajba hawn.
I have another idea.	Għandi idea oħra.
He would have to try harder.	Kien ikollu jipprova aktar.
And now there was no one.	U issa ma kien hemm ħadd.
Look around your house.	Ħares madwar id-dar tiegħek.
It was the truth, and easy to tell.	Kienet il-verità, u faċli tgħid.
But maybe that’s not a problem.	Imma forsi dik mhix problema.
That took a while.	Dak ħa ftit.
It is better than that.	Hija aħjar minn hekk.
And that's it.	U dak hu li.
In fact, you can do more than that.	Fil-fatt, tista 'tagħmel aktar minn dan.
You sure are.	Inti żgur.
Not really, no.	Mhux tassew, le.
Well that's out.	Ukoll li barra.
I really talk to you.	Tassew nitkellem miegħek.
He didn’t want to be there.	Ma riedx ikun hemm.
Nobody is really happy.	Ħadd tassew kuntent.
We had everything we needed.	Kellna dak kollu li kellna bżonn.
He just wanted to get out.	Ried biss barra.
Tell anyone what you saw.	Għid lil ħadd dak li rajt.
Both were.	It-tnejn kienu.
Probably saw something.	Probabbilment ra xi ħaġa.
It will never happen.	Qatt ma se jiġri.
It is running smoothly.	Qed jaħdem mingħajr problemi.
I want you to know that.	Irrid li tkun taf dak.
I should have known that.	I kellha naf li.
Wherever you want to go.	Kull fejn trid tmur.
But we need your help.	Imma għandna bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
But we were friends.	Imma konna ħbieb.
I think something.	Naħseb li xi ħaġa.
It was quite a job.	Kien pjuttost xogħol.
But he did nothing.	Imma ma għamel xejn.
But better than nothing.	Imma aħjar minn xejn.
The work is not finished.	Ix-xogħol mhux lest.
If you really want to know.	Jekk verament trid tkun taf.
What I saw was just so.	Dak li rajt kien biss hekk.
Or to make one myself.	Jew biex nagħmel waħda jien.
But just to be sure.	Imma biss biex tkun ċert.
I don’t think you ever will.	Ma naħsibx li inti qatt.
No one seems to know why.	Ħadd ma jidher li jaf għaliex.
He was great.	Huwa kien kbir.
But they hardly have to.	Imma ma tantx għandhom għalfejn.
He said this once.	Huwa qal dan darba.
Not just a man.	Mhux raġel biss.
You’re not even supposed to be here.	Int lanqas suppost tkun hawn.
He is obviously playing well.	Huwa ovvjament qed jilgħab tajjeb.
I had to do this before.	I kellha tagħmel dan qabel.
She was alone and no one knew where she was.	Kienet waħedha u ħadd ma kien jaf fejn kienet.
He was supposed to be.	Huwa suppost kellha tkun.
Or maybe it was more than that.	Jew forsi kien aktar minn dan.
It will not be difficult.	Mhux se jkun diffiċli.
It’s not so bad.	Mhuwiex ħażin daqshekk.
She was still there.	Kienet għadha hemm.
You know, everything I wanted was great.	Taf, dak kollu li ridt kien kbir.
You know, you know nothing.	Tista’ tkun taf, ma taf xejn.
You will be mine.	Int tkun tiegħi.
Not bad.	Mhuwiex ħażin.
She might know something.	Hija tista 'tkun taf xi ħaġa.
But maybe that’s a good thing.	Imma forsi dik hija ħaġa tajba.
I was sure of it.	Jien kont ċert minn dan.
That wasn’t now either, of course.	Li ma kienx issa lanqas, ovvjament.
This is not a help.	Din mhix għajnuna.
No, this will not work.	Le, dan mhux se jaħdem.
It will probably never happen.	Probabbilment qatt mhu se jiġri.
You are always there.	Int dejjem hemm.
I think you should go have it.	Naħseb li għandek tmur għandu.
Well, almost everyone.	Ukoll, kważi kulħadd.
She looked around.	Hija ħares madwar.
He did what he could.	Kien għamel li seta’.
He had in fact done nothing.	Fil-fatt ma kien għamel xejn.
I think that's good.	Naħseb li tajjeb.
I hope it can come soon.	Nispera li jista’ jiġi malajr.
That's what he does.	Huwa dak li jagħmel.
There was much more.	Kien hemm wisq aktar.
I'm getting better.	Jien sejjer aħjar.
I still can’t say.	Għadni ma nistax ngħid.
She was who she was.	Kienet min kienet.
He had gone through enough.	Huwa kien għadda minn biżżejjed.
But he would not.	Imma ma kienx se.
He just couldn’t leave.	Biss ma setax jitlaq.
But he wasn’t the only one.	Imma ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
We are not the problem.	Aħna mhux il-problema.
That will be tomorrow.	Dak se jkun għada.
Not sure yet.	Għadu ma kienx ċert.
I say no to many things.	Jien ngħid le għal ħafna affarijiet.
Try these tomorrow.	Ipprova dawn għada.
He was already unemployed.	Kien diġà bla xogħol.
It's not you.	Mhuwiex int.
I need some help with something.	Għandi bżonn xi għajnuna ma 'xi ħaġa.
That you knew.	Li kont taf.
It was pretty easy for me.	Kien pjuttost faċli għalija.
I hear you well.	Nisma int tajjeb.
I think that’s a good thing.	Naħseb li hija ħaġa tajba.
I don’t like to do anything.	Ma nħobbx nagħmel xejn.
Look what I did.	Ħares dak li għamilt.
A much better idea.	Idea ħafna aħjar.
Or very few.	Jew ftit ħafna.
He was going to settle down, soon.	Kien se joqgħod, dalwaqt.
He could not see anyone.	Ma seta’ jara lil ħadd.
But that’s what you are.	Imma huwa dak li int.
We were the same.	Konna l-istess.
He died.	Huwa miet.
No one had died.	Ħadd ma kien miet.
It goes well there.	Imur tajjeb hemmhekk.
You can.	Tista .
It was.	Kien.
But not anything else.	Imma mhux xi ħaġa oħra.
There was nothing that anyone could do about it.	Ma kien hemm xejn li xi ħadd jista’ jagħmel għalih.
I would.	Jien nixtieq.
Nothing she did seemed right.	Xejn li għamlet deher li kien tajjeb.
She wants to make everyone happy.	Hija trid tagħmel lil kulħadd kuntent.
It happened before.	Ġara qabel.
I will buy more.	Se nixtri aktar.
I hadn’t before.	Ma kontx qabel.
It was where she was.	Kienet fejn kienet.
He thought of a little more.	Huwa ħaseb fi ftit aktar.
It wasn’t great.	Ma kienx kbir.
It works on its own.	Jaħdem waħdu.
This is where we want to be.	Dan huwa fejn irridu nkunu.
No such thing before now.	L-ebda ħaġa bħal din qabel issa.
Maybe she should.	Forsi kellha.
I say too much.	Jien ngħid wisq.
I thought I knew about it.	Ħsibt li kont tkun taf dwarha.
He had to eat something.	Kellu jiekol xi ħaġa.
I say so.	Jien ngħid hekk.
But that’s not what we had.	Imma dan mhux dak li kellna.
One single person.	Persuna waħda waħda.
It must come to us.	Għandu jiġi għandna.
I did something outside.	Għamilt xi ħaġa barra.
He needed to know what had happened.	Kellu jkun jaf x’ġara.
You are not very tired.	M'intix għajjien ħafna.
But there is nothing he cannot wait until tomorrow.	Imma m'hemm xejn li ma jistax jistenna sa għada.
I never saw it coming.	Qatt ma rajt li ġej.
I heard about that one.	Smajt dwar dak wieħed.
And he wasn’t the only one.	U ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
They have that.	Huma għandhom dak.
Not that she needed to.	Mhux li kellha bżonn.
Anyone can eat this.	Kulħadd jista’ jiekol dan.
But maybe now, you know, you should go.	Imma forsi issa, taf, għandek tmur.
It would be bad of me.	Ikun ħażin minni.
No one had, as far as she knew.	Ħadd ma kellu, sa fejn kienet taf.
He never had, really.	Qatt ma kellu, tassew.
There you are.	Hemmhekk int.
I have no idea, man, he said.	M'għandi l-ebda idea, raġel, qal.
Now be someone else for a while.	Issa jkun xi ħadd ieħor għal xi żmien.
They make a lot and a lot of money.	Jagħmlu ħafna u ħafna flus.
That will never happen.	Dak qatt mhu se jiġri.
Really worried about that.	Verament inkwetat dwar dan.
And everyone was great.	U kulħadd kien kbir.
Too much for me.	Wisq għalija.
It’s all there is.	Huwa dak kollu li hemm.
He wanted to.	Ried.
He's worried about it.	Huwa inkwetat dwarha.
Sure, I can do that.	Żgur, nista 'nagħmel dan.
I think it’s a good one.	Naħseb li hija waħda tajba.
Now she knows the truth.	Issa hi taf il-verità.
I was really happy.	Kont tassew kuntent.
We are tired.	Aħna għajjien.
This happens often.	Dan jiġri spiss.
Plus, he wasn’t going to be here for long.	Barra minn hekk, ma kienx se jkun hawn għal żmien twil.
Good.	Tajjeb.
I had never done so before.	Qatt ma kont għamilt hekk qabel.
And it probably should.	U probabbilment għandu.
We do a lot more now.	Nagħmlu ħafna aktar issa.
The truth is.	Il-verità hi.
A friend was with me.	Ħabib kien miegħi.
I did it, and I do it again.	Għamilt hekk, u nerġa’ nagħmel.
And now it’s about to happen.	U issa wasal biex jiġri.
You don't want that, of course.	Inti ma tridx li, ovvjament.
I'm going up.	Jien sejjer sa.
You are having fun.	Qed tagħmel gost.
Not for him, but for you.	Mhux għalih, imma għalik.
I doubt he does.	Niddubita li hekk jagħmel.
One would think he knew this by now.	Wieħed jaħseb li kien jaf dan sa issa.
I’m having a good time.	Qed nagħmel ħin tajjeb.
Now tell everyone about it.	Issa għid lil kulħadd dwarha.
No one wanted to know anything.	Ħadd ma ried ikun jaf xejn.
And it was enough.	U kien biżżejjed.
I know there is more.	Naf li hemm aktar.
It would have been late.	Kienet tkun tard.
I understand how this can happen.	Nifhem kif dan jista’ jiġri.
A man came out.	Raġel ħareġ.
He was trying.	Kien jipprova.
It was a little early.	Kien ftit kmieni.
Only then was she eating.	Hekk biss kienet tiekol.
No, no time for anything like that.	Le, l-ebda ħin għal xi ħaġa minn hekk.
That is all we have.	Dan huwa dak kollu li għandna.
But not so easy.	Imma mhux daqshekk faċli.
Maybe once and for all.	Forsi darba għal dejjem.
He didn't know.	Ma kienx jaf.
On me.	Fuq lili.
But you did what you had to do.	Imma int għamilt dak li kellek tagħmel.
All this had actually happened.	Dan kollu kien fil-fatt ġara.
To see.	Biex tara .
Today only one was needed.	Illum kien hemm bżonn wieħed biss.
Some money, maybe.	Xi flus, forsi.
I hope it wasn’t too bad.	Nispera li ma tantx kien ħażin.
I already know who to ask.	Diġà naf lil min nistaqsi.
Maybe I wasn’t.	Forsi ma kontx.
For so long.	Għal tant.
I thought it was great.	Ħsibt li kien kbir.
I wanted to be alone.	Ridt inkun waħdi.
It’s just so much better.	Huwa biss daqshekk aħjar.
You really had to go have more than me.	Tassew kellek tmur għandu aktar milli lili.
Or no one.	Jew ħadd.
That should be it.	Dan għandu jkun.
.	.
Not so fast.	Mhux daqshekk malajr.
No one can do that for him.	Ħadd ma jista’ jagħmel hekk għalih.
That’s what I’ve been here for.	Huwa dak li ġejt hawn.
Maybe some time tell me all about it.	Forsi xi żmien tgħidli kollox dwarha.
I can’t and I don’t want to know this.	Jien nista u lanqas irrid inkun naf dan.
He almost did it, too.	Huwa kważi għamel dan, ukoll.
But we had.	Imma kellna.
Today that would not be a problem at all.	Illum dik ma tkun problema xejn.
And that was what he wanted to do.	U dan kien dak li ried jagħmel.
It would be better.	Ikun aħjar.
And there is everything you need to know.	U hemmhekk jinsab dak kollu li għandek bżonn tkun taf.
He was not surprised.	Ma kienx sorpriż.
He doesn’t know much about anything.	Ma jaf ħafna dwar xejn.
I'm an idea man.	Jien raġel idea.
But this was not so.	Imma dan ma kienx hekk.
Come home early.	Tiġi d-dar kmieni.
And now it’s too late.	U issa huwa tard wisq.
This was my first time here.	Din kienet l-ewwel darba tiegħi hawn.
It didn’t have to be, either.	Ma kellux ikun, lanqas.
Nothing more happened.	Ma ġara xejn aktar.
Not as bad as you think.	Mhux ħażin kif taħseb.
And good for him.	U tajjeb għalih.
It’s quite a bit more than that.	Huwa pjuttost ftit aktar minn hekk.
I’m not already there.	Jien m'iniex diġà hemm.
I wish I had seen it.	Nixtieq li stajt rajt.
Your car or mine.	Il-karozza tiegħek jew tiegħi.
It's just not over.	Huwa biss mhux fuq.
It’s not going as well as it did yesterday.	Mhux sejjer tajjeb daqs il-bieraħ.
I think he thought better.	Naħseb li ħaseb aħjar.
It doesn’t seem to work.	Ma jidhirx li jaħdem.
Or something was.	Jew xi ħaġa kienet.
Anyone could have done that.	Kulħadd seta' għamel dan.
Ours is really good.	Tagħna hija tassew tajba.
But it is not the truth.	Imma mhix il-verità.
She knew she looked beautiful.	Kienet taf li kienet tidher sabiħa.
Now he wants to talk.	Issa jrid jitkellem.
Not quite, but almost.	Mhux pjuttost, imma kważi.
And that's it.	U dan huwa dak.
I thought this was a good thing.	Ħsibt li din kienet ħaġa tajba.
There is the last thing.	Hemm l-aħħar ħaġa.
It's time.	Wasal iż-żmien.
.	.
I'm not afraid either.	Lanqas nibża’.
And they are easy to please.	U huma faċli biex jekk jogħġbok.
I had no idea who you were.	Ma kellix idea li tkun int.
But for us it was really, really bad.	Imma għalina kien tassew, tassew ħażin.
This house had something for everyone.	Din id-dar kellha xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
I don’t have to worry.	M'għandix għalfejn inkun inkwetat.
A little bit.	Ftit ftit.
And it was very, very difficult.	U kien diffiċli ħafna, ħafna.
This will be no problem.	Din se tkun l-ebda problema.
They are almost the same.	Huma kważi l-istess.
I have from here.	Għandi minn hawn.
We knew where we were.	Konna nafu fejn konna.
It's late in the evening.	Huwa tard filgħaxija.
It should be.	Għandu jkun.
Do it every year.	Jagħmlu kull sena.
You are too alone here.	Inti wisq waħdek hawn.
They do, of course.	Huma jagħmlu dan, ovvjament.
I knew this pretty well.	Kont naf dan pjuttost tajjeb.
I can’t have another idea.	Ma nistax ikolli idea oħra.
There didn’t seem to be anything here.	Ma deher li kien hemm xejn hawn.
No, there was another time.	Le, kien hemm żmien ieħor.
Just for me.	Għalija biss.
I knew, and I couldn’t see anything wrong.	Kont naf, u ma stajt nara xejn ħażin.
We have enough money.	Għandna biżżejjed flus.
Not what you were thinking.	Mhux dak li kont qed taħseb.
He didn't tell anyone.	Ma qal lil ħadd.
As soon as he wanted something, he took it.	Hekk kif ried xi ħaġa, ħa.
You are not supposed to do that.	M'intix suppost tagħmel dan.
Whatever please.	Tkun xi tkun jekk jogħġbok.
This seems to work for me.	Dan jidher li jaħdem għalija.
We don’t have time for this anymore.	M'għandniex ħin għal dan aktar.
I never thought about it.	Jien qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan.
I don’t want him to know.	Ma rridx li jkun jaf.
Another, another, another.	Ieħor, ieħor, ieħor.
But you have to tell me what's going on.	Imma trid tgħidli x’inhu jiġri.
Much more fun.	Ħafna aktar gost.
Plus, there was something about it.	Barra minn hekk, kien hemm xi ħaġa dwarha.
There was nothing he could say.	Ma kien hemm xejn li seta’ jgħid.
It was my first car.	Kienet l-ewwel karozza tiegħi.
And no, I didn’t.	U le, ma kontx.
I need to know why you’re here.	Għandi bżonn inkun naf għaliex int hawn.
I did a pretty good job.	Għamilt xogħol pjuttost tajjeb.
He actually said so.	Huwa fil-fatt qal hekk.
In fact, it is much more difficult than that.	Fil-fatt, huwa ħafna aktar diffiċli minn hekk.
But so do other people.	Imma hekk jagħmlu nies oħra.
It's not fun.	Mhuwiex gost.
I have been thinking a lot about this.	Ilni naħseb ħafna dwar dan.
Mine looks something like this.	Tiegħi tidher xi ħaġa bħal din.
Or you can't.	Jew ma tistax.
I don’t want to talk about anything like that.	Ma rridx nitkellem dwar xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I was.	Jiena kont.
But he will come back to me.	Imma hu ser jiġi lura għandi.
I had no idea about it.	Ma kellix idea dwarha.
Well, that wasn’t going to happen.	Ukoll, dan ma kienx se jiġri.
And we are friends.	U aħna ħbieb.
But there we are.	Imma hemm aħna.
It's just not me.	Huwa biss mhux jien.
But no.	Imma le.
I wanted to talk to you.	Ridt li nitkellem miegħek.
Maybe it was both.	Forsi kien it-tnejn.
This looks great.	Dan jidher ħafna.
It all started about a year ago.	Kollox beda madwar sena ilu.
A few hours.	Ftit sigħat.
This was not supposed to go.	Dan ma kienx kif suppost kellha tmur.
Come back to me.	Ejja lura għandi.
No one did so and left.	Ħadd ma għamel hekk u telaq.
He was still tired.	Kien għadu għajjien.
I'm so happy.	Jien tant kuntent.
It seems a long time ago.	Jidher żmien ilu.
This doesn’t seem hard to do, and it’s not.	Dan ma jidhirx diffiċli li tagħmel, u mhuwiex.
We have you back.	Għandna inti lura.
We did everything.	Għamilna dak kollu.
Sure, he had.	Żgur, kellu.
It was something she needed to see and think about.	Kienet xi ħaġa li kellha bżonn tara u taħseb dwarha.
Definitely not going to be so bad.	Żgur li mhux se jkun daqshekk ħażin .
I think you will be happy.	Naħseb li tkun kuntent.
You are not wrong.	M'intix ħażin.
I will do it a few hours ahead of time.	Se nagħmel ftit sigħat qabel iż-żmien.
It's good.	Hija tajba.
Here’s my problem with this.	Hawn il-problema tiegħi b'dan.
It has always been ours.	Dejjem kien tagħna.
He is doing nothing.	Mhu qed jagħmel xejn.
It's really that easy.	Huwa verament daqshekk faċli.
Why? 	Għaliex?
You come with us.	Int tiġi magħna.
I was scared, but not anymore.	Kont nibża’, imma mhux aktar.
I believe they are right.	Nemmen li għandhom raġun.
That's all they do.	Dan huwa dak kollu li jagħmlu.
Almost a man.	Kważi raġel.
He was about to speak.	Huwa wasal biex jitkellem.
It’s just that he’s always with you.	Huwa biss li hu dejjem miegħek.
Good for me.	Tajjeb għalija.
I’ve heard enough.	Smajt biżżejjed.
No, she doesn't.	Le, hi ma.
All this does.	Dan kollu jagħmel.
I just can’t do that.	Jien biss ma nistax nagħmel dan.
It may not have been.	Seta’ ma kienx.
Definitely enough, he said.	Żgur biżżejjed, hekk qal.
I think just about everything.	Naħseb biss dwar kollox.
As it should be.	Kif kellu jkun.
I so didn’t want to be here.	Jien hekk ma ridtx inkun hawn.
That’s never good.	Dak qatt mhu tajjeb.
I’m sure no one thinks.	Jien ċert li ħadd ma jaħseb.
Nothing more can really be done.	Xejn aktar ma jista 'verament isir.
There is always something more you can do.	Dejjem hemm xi ħaġa aktar li tista 'tagħmel.
Just don’t, that’s all.	Biss m'għandekx, dak kollu.
He never thought he would come to this.	Qatt ma kien ħaseb li se jasal għal dan.
Like.	Bħal .
Everyone had to be around all the time.	Kulħadd kellu jkun madwar il-ħin kollu.
There, that was the truth.	Hemmhekk, dik kienet il-verità.
And yours too.	U tiegħek lanqas.
Hard to say how much of each.	Diffiċli ngħid kemm minn kull wieħed.
In fact, so it should be.	Fil-fatt, hekk għandu jkun.
If they do.	Jekk jagħmlu.
You want to know.	Trid tkun taf.
You either said too much or not enough.	Int jew għidt wisq jew mhux biżżejjed.
Not that evening, ever.	Mhux dik il-lejla, qatt.
Nothing else was working.	Xejn aktar ma kien qed jaħdem.
It actually helps.	Fil-fatt jgħin.
Here it is !.	Hawn hi!.
All of this was good.	Dan kollu kien tajjeb.
We will never know.	Qatt ma nkunu nafu.
That was all he said.	Kien dak kollu li qal.
I know why I thought I did.	Naf għaliex ħsibt li għamilt.
We both need to know.	It-tnejn għandna nkunu nafu.
But this has never been the case.	Imma dan qatt ma kien hekk.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Ma kien hemm xejn li seta' jagħmel dwar dan.
It was what everyone thought.	Kien dak li ħaseb kulħadd.
I better not tell anyone.	Aħjar ma għidt lil ħadd.
Look back here.	Ħares lura hawn.
Nothing, or no one.	Xejn, jew ħadd.
We don’t have the time for that.	M'għandniex il-ħin għal dan.
It wasn’t very good at the time.	Dak iż-żmien ma kienx tajjeb ħafna.
I didn’t want to know anymore.	Ma ridtx inkun naf aktar.
Many things are.	Ħafna affarijiet huma.
Please, please, please.	Jekk jogħġbok, jekk jogħġbok, jekk jogħġbok.
Now we have only one.	Issa għandna wieħed biss.
That car I needed.	Dik il-karozza kelli bżonn.
This would make yours.	Din kienet tagħmel tiegħek.
But you know too much.	Imma taf wisq wisq.
It would be better.	Ikun aħjar.
He already is.	Huwa diġà hu.
Both do.	It-tnejn jagħmlu.
Nor can it be otherwise.	Lanqas ma jkun jista’ jkun mod ieħor.
Really, really happy.	Tassew, tassew kuntent.
You are taking from something.	Qed tieħu minn xi ħaġa.
You were around.	Inti kont madwar.
I never go there again.	Jien qatt ma mmur hemm aktar.
She needed to know.	Hija kellha bżonn tkun taf.
But it does nothing.	Imma ma jagħmel xejn b’dan.
I didn’t know how to do it.	Ma kontx naf kif nagħmel.
And he says for sure.	U jgħid żgur.
All this I have seen before.	Dan kollu rajt qabel.
This could be you.	Dan jista 'jkun int.
I was glad she was there.	Kont ferħan li kienet hemm.
.	.
But we don’t have much time right now.	Imma m'għandniex ħafna ħin bħalissa.
There are many.	Hemm ħafna.
This is not working at all.	Dan mhu qed jaħdem xejn.
One, and only one.	Wieħed, u wieħed biss.
I really hope you are happy here.	Tassew nittama li int kuntent hawn.
Here someone had died, and recently.	Hawn xi ħadd kien miet, u dan l-aħħar.
But you were one for.	Imma int kont wieħed għal.
No one could say.	Ħadd ma seta’ jgħid.
He felt better after that.	Huwa ħassu aħjar wara dak.
You do the same as well.	Int tagħmel l-istess ukoll.
Another one can come.	Wieħed ieħor jista’ jiġi.
Later.	Aktar tard.
He has a long time until then.	Huwa għandu ħafna żmien sa dak iż-żmien.
I would like to see more.	Nixtieq nara aktar.
Not the first time this has happened.	Mhux l-ewwel darba li ġara.
Maybe you can see that.	Forsi tista' tara dan.
I’ve understood it very well.	Stajt nifhem tajjeb ħafna.
That he never had, never was.	Li qatt ma kellu, qatt ma kien.
I have never seen so many people.	Qatt ma rajt daqshekk nies.
You have to do it.	Trid tagħmel dan.
What was the job.	X'kien ix-xogħol.
He will be coming soon.	Huwa se jkun ġej dalwaqt.
He should have, probably.	Huwa għandu jkollu, probabbilment.
But it was a little too late.	Imma kien ftit wisq tard.
One was small only once.	Wieħed kien żgħir biss darba.
And, sure, all right.	U, żgur, kollox tajjeb.
I heard how.	Smajt kif.
But now we need to know better.	Imma issa għandna nkunu nafu aħjar.
I was there to eat.	Kont hemm biex niekol.
She can do it.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan.
What I know no one can know.	Dak li naf ħadd ma jista’ jkun jaf.
It really wasn’t anything more than that.	Ma kienx verament xejn aktar minn hekk.
I think quite likely.	Naħseb li pjuttost probabbli.
It was happening so fast.	Kien qed jiġri hekk malajr.
But apparently few people are.	Imma milli jidher ftit nies huma.
This was done.	Dan sar.
I couldn’t see much.	Ma stajtx tara ħafna.
It was very, very bad.	Kien ħażin ħafna, ħafna.
We will definitely go back there.	Żgur li se mmorru lura hemm.
It was so beautiful, something so beautiful.	Kienet tant sabiħa, xi ħaġa tant sabiħa.
That should be it.	Dan għandu jkun.
I know almost as little about her as you do.	Naf kważi ftit dwarha daqskemm int.
He really tried to help.	Huwa tassew ipprova jgħin.
We are not so.	Aħna mhux hekk.
It will never be the same.	Qatt mhu se jkun l-istess.
One way or another, he was going.	Mod jew ieħor, kien sejjer.
And that’s about all he thought.	U dak hu dwar dak kollu li ħaseb.
That works pretty well.	Li jaħdem pjuttost tajjeb.
Bad idea, bad.	Idea ħażina, ħażina.
He came out.	Huwa ħareġ.
This could be faster.	Dan jista 'jkun aktar malajr.
He will be able to live on what he takes.	Huwa se jkun jista 'jgħix fuq dak li jieħu.
I have to be good.	Għandi nkun tajjeb.
It will look good on your resume.	Hija se tidher tajba fuq jerġa tiegħek.
Now he knew for sure.	Issa kien jaf żgur.
This becomes a very easy way.	Dan isir mod faċli ħafna.
I didn’t want to ask.	Ma ridtx nistaqsi.
I should know better.	Għandi nkun naf aħjar.
Maybe there wasn’t much to say.	Forsi ma kienx hemm ħafna xi tgħid.
It's just.	Huwa biss.
He looked like a man.	Deher qisu raġel.
I said no.	Jien għedt le.
It looks like it wasn’t working.	Jidher li ma kienx qed jaħdem.
All, all alone.	Kollha, kollox waħdu.
We cannot do that.	Ma nistgħux nagħmlu dan.
He was loved.	Kien iħobb.
No one was watching.	Ħadd ma kien jara.
It's a really good thing.	Huwa tassew ħaġa tajba.
He did a lot.	Għamel ħafna.
I hope everyone is like them.	Nittama li kulħadd ikun bħal dawn.
You can talk about anything.	Tista' titkellem xi ħaġa.
And he never did anything else.	U xejn aktar qatt ma għamel.
Try another.	Ipprova ieħor.
And that’s pretty much what it is.	U dak huwa pjuttost dak li hu.
I hope it will.	Nistenna li se.
I just want some good time together once in a while.	Irrid biss ftit ħin tajjeb flimkien darba xi żmien.
But it is beautiful.	Imma hija sabiħa.
He had to leave.	Kellu jitlaq.
I'll tell you why.	Jien ngħidlek għaliex.
That's what happened.	Hekk ġara.
Well, it was done.	Ukoll, sar.
For what I did tonight.	Għal dak li għamilt illejla.
He was one of many.	Kien wieħed minn ħafna.
I didn’t want to do anything.	Ma ridt nagħmel xejn.
What will I do? 	X'se nagħmel?
Why ???.	Għalfejn???.
This doesn’t look like much.	Dan ma jidhirx qisu ħafna.
I am very sorry.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna.
You should be glad of that too.	Għandek tkun ferħan b'dan ukoll.
No one had.	Ħadd ma kellu.
And so it was.	U hekk kien.
Everything went back to how it was.	Kollox mar lura kif kien.
I wish he would.	Nixtieq li kieku.
I tell you this.	Jien ngħidlek dan.
Not for everyone.	Mhux għal kulħadd.
But they are not.	Imma mhux huma.
I don’t have to buy anymore.	M'għandix nixtri aktar.
She wants one.	Hija trid waħda.
Maybe you heard about it.	Forsi smajt dwarha.
You are here to stay.	Int hawn biex toqgħod.
No one wants to live there.	Ħadd ma jrid jgħix hemm.
But we need something more.	Imma għandna bżonn xi ħaġa aktar.
Time has passed.	Iż-żmien għadda.
They are ours.	Huma tagħna.
It’s just on the back, that’s all.	Huwa biss fuq wara, dak kollu.
It could have been almost nothing.	Seta’ kien kważi xejn.
But not good.	Imma mhux tajjeb.
Or, more likely, both.	Jew, aktar probabbli, it-tnejn.
So much, so good.	Tant, daqshekk tajjeb.
None of these.	Xejn minn dawn.
He has a job.	Għandu xogħol.
I can do that too.	Jien nista’ nagħmel hekk ukoll.
I don't have time.	M'għandix ħin.
I will take a few friends.	Se nieħu ftit ħbieb.
It’s hard to see it any other way.	Huwa diffiċli li tara xi mod ieħor.
And she was not alone.	U ma kinitx waħedha.
I'm not about that.	Jien mhux dwar dan.
It’s harder than anything.	Huwa aktar diffiċli minn kull ħaġa.
It's so easy.	Huwa daqshekk faċli.
You’ve always been a big boy.	Int dejjem kont tifel kbir.
He had come home.	Huwa kien ġie d-dar.
He agreed to do so.	Huwa qabel li jagħmel hekk.
But this is not so.	Imma dan mhux hekk.
I may never come back.	Jien forsi qatt ma nerġa’ lura.
Just like always.	Eżatt bħal dejjem.
I was a boy.	Kont tifel.
He could not stay here.	Ma setax jibqa’ hawn.
Now he was going.	Issa kien sejjer.
It just really works.	Huwa biss verament jaħdem.
But no.	Imma le.
Way, harder.	Mod, aktar diffiċli.
I really don’t want to be alone right now.	Verament ma rridx inkun waħdi bħalissa.
The problem, more or less.	Il-problema, xi ftit jew wisq.
And not just you.	U mhux int biss.
He was not going to win.	Ma kienx se jirbaħ.
Nothing works.	Xejn ma jaħdem.
You can’t know what to do on a child.	Ma tistax tkun taf dak li jagħmel fuq tifel.
You don’t have to do anything.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel xi ħaġa.
And of course they are right.	U ovvjament għandhom raġun.
I have been for a long time.	Ilni żmien twil.
It comes from above.	Jiġi minn fuq.
And there it is.	U qiegħed hemm.
I would never have been like that.	Jien qatt ma kont inkun hekk.
I have no problem doing that.	M'għandi l-ebda problema biex nagħmel dan.
Keep talking.	Jibqa’ jitkellem.
That will have to wait.	Li se jkollu jistenna.
I definitely can’t speak.	Żgur li ma nistax nitkellem.
And a little happy.	U ftit kuntent.
I told some people.	għidt xi nies.
It was so much.	Kienet hekk ħafna.
Try again.	Ipprova mill-ġdid.
Much, much easier.	Ħafna, ħafna aktar faċli.
Now he seemed worried.	Issa deher inkwetat.
That you don't think was good.	Li ma taħseb kienet tajba.
This is really long ago.	Dan huwa verament twil ilu.
I’m at school, you know.	Jien l-iskola, taf.
I know, whatever happened.	Naf, ġara x’ġara.
But someone had to.	Imma xi ħadd kellu.
But he thought he knew.	Imma ħaseb li kien jaf.
Not back.	Mhux lura.
That’s all we know for sure.	Dak hu dak kollu li nafu żgur.
Which is a great idea.	Li hija idea kbira.
But there was no one.	Imma ma kien hemm ħadd.
It was a really good year for us.	Kienet sena tassew tajba għalina.
Maybe it’s both.	Forsi huwa t-tnejn.
I will not be back tonight.	Mhux se nerġa nkun illejla.
I’m not sure how small he is.	M'inix ċert kemm hu żgħir.
We had this yesterday.	Kellna dan ilbieraħ.
I didn’t want to be.	Jien ma ridtx inkun.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
To say you don’t.	Li tgħid li ma tagħmilx hekk.
It seemed better to him.	Kien jidher aħjar għalih.
Ra ra ra.	Ra ra ra.
This would not be so bad.	Dan ma jkunx daqshekk ħażin.
And we were doing that.	U konna nagħmlu hekk.
For me, this is not so great.	Għalija, dan mhux daqshekk kbir.
I'll talk to you later.	I ser nitkellem miegħek aktar tard.
It’s much, much faster.	Huwa ħafna, ħafna aktar malajr.
On what was to come.	Fuq dak li kien ġej.
Very, very fast.	Ħafna, malajr ħafna.
I can't say more.	Ma nistax ngħid aktar.
More work is needed.	Jeħtieġ aktar xogħol.
He's going.	Hu mmorru.
Just like when eating.	Eżatt bħal meta jiekol.
Again, it seems.	Mill-ġdid, jidher.
I hope you are well.	Nispera li int tajjeb.
I know he wasn’t happy with me anymore.	Naf li ma kienx kuntent miegħi aktar.
Don't do that !.	M'għandekx tagħmel hekk!.
I just can’t be that way.	Jien biss ma nistax inkun hekk.
To do so would have been difficult.	Li tagħmel dan kien ikun diffiċli.
I still can’t really believe it.	Għadni ma nistax nemmen tassew.
He sure knew for quite some time.	Huwa żgur li kien jaf għal żmien mhux ħażin.
It was what he was willing to do today.	Kien dak li kien lest li jagħmel illum.
I believe he is.	Nemmen li hu.
It's just me.	Jien biss jien.
He wasn’t going to speak first.	Ma kienx se jitkellem l-ewwel.
My job, you know.	Ix-xogħol tiegħi, taf.
It’s not really that hard.	Mhuwiex verament daqshekk diffiċli.
I don’t even talk to him.	Lanqas nitkellem miegħu.
All for more money as well.	Kollha għal aktar flus ukoll.
It was already too late.	Kien diġà tard wisq.
Well do what you want.	Ukoll tagħmel dak li trid.
He came into his.	Huwa daħal fi tiegħu.
I hope you know what it is.	Nispera li taf x'inhu.
I'll tell you why.	Jien ser ngħidlek għaliex.
Nothing happened for a while.	Ma ġara xejn għal xi żmien.
She has a son.	Għandu tifel.
He was big enough to know better.	Huwa kien kbir biżżejjed biex ikun jaf aħjar.
It was like everything else.	Kienet bħal kull ħaġa oħra.
Not all things are like this.	Mhux l-affarijiet kollha huma bħal dan.
I didn’t want to believe it.	Ma ridtx nemmen.
I hope he is happy.	Nittama li hu kuntent.
I'll be back soon.	Ser inkun lura dalwaqt.
He may not do so.	Jista’ ma jagħmilx dan.
And so you want.	U hekk trid int.
This is really something.	Din hija verament xi ħaġa.
We will never really know.	Qatt ma nkunu nafu tassew.
He had to live.	Kellu jgħix.
He had a big problem.	Kellu problema kbira.
We don’t have time for that.	M'għandniex ħin għal dan.
I’m sure I regret it.	Jien ċert li jiddispjaċini dwar dan.
He had to know better than that.	Kellu jkun jaf aħjar minn hekk.
But that’s about it.	Imma dak hu dwar kollox.
It's very big.	Huwa kbir ħafna.
It was the first time for me.	Kienet l-ewwel darba għalija.
But he says no chance.	Imma jgħid l-ebda ċans.
And he was not alone.	U ma kienx waħdu.
And more, and more, and more.	U aktar, u aktar, u aktar.
But no one did, you see.	Imma ħadd ma għamel, tara.
That's your time.	Dak il-ħin tiegħek.
Everything was so.	Kollox kien hekk.
Maybe we should.	Forsi għandna.
A friend waits.	Ħabib jistenna.
And you don’t want to know.	U ma tridx tkun taf.
Never go it alone.	Qatt ma tmur waħdek.
I can't tell you anymore.	Ma nistax ngħidlek aktar.
We have to go there.	Irridu mmorru hemm.
I will you.	Jien se int.
Usually he came out.	Normalment huwa ħareġ.
Year after year, they do it.	Sena wara sena, jagħmlu dan.
I loved everyone.	Kont inħobb lil kulħadd.
It didn’t look so good in the morning you.	Ma deherx daqshekk tajjeb filgħodu int.
You must have been quite once.	Int trid kont pjuttost darba.
Hi outside.	Hi barra.
I had to stay there.	Kelli noqgħod hemm.
He went back to the car.	Huwa mar lura lejn il-karozza.
It works great.	Jaħdem ħafna.
Now it has happened, he thought.	Issa ġara, ħaseb.
It was pretty good before.	Kien pjuttost tajjeb qabel.
I'm this.	Jien dan.
There wasn’t really time to think.	Ma kienx hemm verament ħin biex taħseb.
But it doesn’t.	Imma ma jagħmilx hekk.
But that’s still too much.	Imma dak għadu wisq.
It’s never too late.	Qatt m'hu tard wisq.
I will not try again.	Mhux se nerġa' nipprova.
But she knows this enough.	Imma hi taf dan biżżejjed.
This could not happen.	Dan ma setax jiġri.
Why are you still here ?.	Għaliex għadek hawn?.
I want to tell you the last thing.	Irrid ngħidlek l-aħħar ħaġa.
We have to do both.	Irridu nagħmlu t-tnejn.
We need another person.	Għandna bżonn persuna oħra.
It is a great help.	Hija għajnuna kbira.
She is glad to me.	Hija ferħan lili.
I’m not going to say more than that.	Jien mhux ser ngħid aktar minn hekk.
In fact, you could say that.	Fil-fatt, inti tista 'tgħid li.
Say nothing.	Tgħid xejn.
He just can't.	Huwa biss ma jistax.
I know it’s great.	Naf li hija kbira.
In fact, it is sometimes very difficult.	Fil-fatt, xi drabi huwa diffiċli ħafna.
I didn’t want anything.	Jien ma ridt xejn.
I couldn’t have that.	Ma setax ikolli dak.
Not only that.	Mhux hekk biss.
At that time we need help.	Dak iż-żmien għandna bżonn l-għajnuna.
I need to tell you nothing more.	Għandi bżonn ngħidlek xejn aktar.
Look at the truth.	Ħares lejn il-verità.
He saw nothing, in fact.	Ra xejn, fil-fatt.
Anyone can go home.	Kulħadd jista’ jmur id-dar.
We have, we have.	Għandna, għandna.
I’m a great man.	Jien raġel kbir.
You will not be able to.	Inti mhux se tkun kapaċi.
But nothing like that.	Imma xejn bħal dan.
This is a good thing and a bad thing.	Din hija ħaġa tajba u ħaġa ħażina.
Whatever you want to do.	Tkun xi tkun trid tagħmel.
Just some man.	Biss xi raġel.
Nothing else will work there.	Xejn aktar mhu se jaħdem hemm.
All this was going wrong.	Dan kollu kien sejjer ħażin.
But he is much more.	Imma hu ħafna aktar.
Some, who knows.	Xi, min jaf.
But this never had to be.	Imma dan qatt ma kellu jkun.
That's just me.	Dak jien biss.
Like everyone else.	Bħal kulħadd.
But no more.	Imma mhux aktar.
I wanted it to be mine.	Ridt li tkun tiegħi.
Just over a year ago.	Ftit aktar minn sena ilu.
Maybe you do too.	Forsi tagħmel ukoll.
It just happened, all that.	Ġara biss, dak kollu.
So it seems at the moment.	Hekk jidher bħalissa.
It looked bad.	Deher ħażin.
Not one or the other, but both.	Mhux waħda jew oħra, imma t-tnejn.
That was once too much.	Dik kienet darba wisq.
Hopefully, right?	Wieħed jista’ jittama, hux?.
It was a very good time.	Kien żmien tajjeb ħafna.
That was, of course, quite some time ago.	Dan kien, ovvjament, pjuttost żmien ilu.
I’m doing a really great job.	Qed nagħmel xogħol tassew kbir.
He already had it back.	Huwa diġà kellu lura.
She was not doing anything wrong.	Ma kienet qed tagħmel xejn ħażin.
He can have someone.	Jista’ jkollu lil xi ħadd.
I was busy now.	Kont okkupat issa.
You are ready to go.	Inti lest biex tmur.
This could not be right.	Dan ma setax ikun tajjeb.
It goes that way.	Imur hekk.
And so it is.	U hekk għadu.
It was with him when he died.	Kien miegħu meta miet.
Here's your problem.	Hawn il-problema tiegħek.
Something is happening here.	Hawn qed jiġri xi ħaġa.
Wherever you say.	Kull fejn tgħid.
I was before.	I kien qabel.
That told me something.	Dan qalli xi ħaġa.
Just like a man.	Eżatt bħal raġel.
Everyone wanted to be with him.	Kulħadd ried ikun miegħu.
He will soon need none of this.	Dalwaqt ma jkollu bżonn xejn minn dan.
I need to do better than that.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel aħjar minn dan.
I've been wrong.	Stajt ħażin tiegħi.
A man she hardly knew.	Raġel li ma tantx kienet taf.
At that time he was there.	Dak iż-żmien kien hemm.
But it has arrived.	Imma wasal.
I shouldn’t have come back.	Ma kellix ġejt lura.
Work, work.	Xogħol, xogħol.
This is what they felt.	Dan huwa dak li ħassu.
Everyone knows we can.	Kulħadd jaf li nistgħu.
It will definitely be back.	Żgur se tkun lura.
I need to come home.	Għandi bżonn li tiġi d-dar.
I think it would be.	Naħseb li jkun.
He doesn’t like living here.	Ma jħobbx jgħix hawn.
Everything was so long ago.	Kollox kien tant ilu.
I know it was good.	Naf li kien tajjeb.
It was a great thing.	Kienet xi ħaġa kbira.
I couldn’t tell why.	Ma setax ngħid għaliex.
Just me.	Jien biss.
She did not know what he was thinking.	Ma kinitx taf x’kien qed jaħseb.
It’s just that he seems to be.	Huwa biss li jidher li hu.
We need to know what happened there.	Irridu nkunu nafu x’ġara hemmhekk.
Nothing we do is wrong.	Xejn li nagħmlu mhu tajjeb.
Work will do this for you.	Ix-xogħol se jagħmel dan għalik.
There was no one to see.	Ma kien hemm min jidher.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Huwa seta 'jagħmel dak kollu li ried.
It’s not always good for everyone either.	Mhux dejjem huwa tajjeb għal kulħadd lanqas.
But, so, so much fun.	Imma, hekk, tant gost.
no who knows.	le min ikun jaf.
This was done.	Dan sar.
But who can say.	Imma min jista’ jgħid.
It was a good year !.	Kienet sena tajba!.
It has become too much here.	Sar wisq hawn.
A man would be happy if he had everything.	Raġel ikun kuntent jekk ikollu kollox.
I can't see a way.	Ma nistax nara mod.
But he didn’t have a chance to say so.	Imma ma kellux ċans jgħid hekk.
I doubt it ever will.	Niddubita jekk qatt se.
He did what he came to do.	Għamel dak li ġie biex jagħmel.
I need say no more.	Ikolli bżonn ngħid mhux aktar.
Something was being done there.	Kien isir xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
Not if.	Mhux jekk.
I need someone here.	Għandi bżonn xi ħadd hawn.
We will do the same.	Aħna se nagħmlu l-istess.
Look at his things.	Ħares lejn l-affarijiet tiegħu.
Long enough for both of us.	Twil biżżejjed għalina t-tnejn.
But that's all there is to it.	Imma dak kollu hemm.
We can know many things.	Nistgħu nkunu nafu ħafna affarijiet.
There would be nothing.	Ma kien ikun hemm xejn.
That's good.	Dak hu tajjeb.
After all, he was still here.	Wara kollox, kien għadu hawn.
It could have been him.	Seta’ kien hu.
So we did.	Hekk għamilna.
Or need help.	Jew bżonn l-għajnuna.
You can do better than that.	Tista 'tagħmel aħjar minn hekk.
We were never here.	Qatt ma konna hawn.
Tom couldn't wait.	Tom ma setax jistenna.
Where are you ?.	Fejn int?.
I don’t expect anyone to be there.	Ma nistenna li xi ħadd ikun hemm.
The truth is that no one knows.	Il-verità hi li ħadd ma jaf.
John, that was me.	John, dak kont jien.
I knew what was coming next.	Kont naf x’kien se jiġi wara.
That was all she was saying.	Dan kien kull ma kienet tgħid.
No one wants that to happen.	Ħadd ma jrid li jiġri hekk.
This was obviously not what happened.	Dan ovvjament ma kienx dak li ġara.
You may be surprised.	Inti tista 'tkun sorpriż.
Pretty good actually.	Pjuttost tajjeb fil-fatt.
You just had to go.	Inti biss kellha tmur.
He knew we knew.	Kien jaf li konna nafu.
He walked to the door.	Huwa telaq lejn il-bieb.
If I didn’t, there would be a problem.	Kieku ma kontx, ikun hemm problema.
He never needed to, until now.	Qatt ma kellu bżonn, sa issa.
He’s more than just doing his bit.	Huwa aktar milli għamel ftit tiegħu.
Maybe that was the problem.	Forsi dik kienet il-problema.
It can work if it wants to.	Jista 'jaħdem jekk irid.
You were there.	Int kont hemm.
Try that.	Ipprova dak.
I thought wrong.	Ħsibt ħażin.
They are not supposed to.	Huma mhux suppost.
Maybe they are already all friends.	Forsi diġà huma kollha ħbieb.
My only problem is.	L-unika problema tiegħi hi.
Whoever she is, it’s the same thing.	Hi min hi, hija l-istess ħaġa.
He didn't want anyone to stay too long.	Ma riedx li ħadd jibqa’ twil wisq.
I have no idea what he looks like.	M'għandi l-ebda idea kif jidher hu.
But not so fast.	Imma mhux daqshekk malajr.
You are absolutely right.	Għandek raġun għal kollox.
No one can help anyone.	Ħadd ma jista’ jgħin lil ħadd.
This book was just fine.	Dan il-ktieb kien biss tajjeb.
She didn’t know why.	Ma kinitx taf għaliex.
But let me tell you something.	Imma ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
She is not good.	Hija mhix tajba.
Do nothing else.	Ma tagħmel xejn ieħor.
He seemed so happy.	Huwa deher tant kuntent.
You must be so.	Inti trid tkun hekk.
Where he came from.	Minn fejn kien ġej.
Everyone does it, and it works.	Kulħadd jagħmel dan, u jaħdem.
I’m not worried about other people.	Jien mhux inkwetat dwar nies oħra.
There is no way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod.
It never will.	Qatt qatt ma se.
Like how you are.	Bħal kif int.
I'm the same.	Jien l-istess.
He was everything to me.	Huwa kien kollox għalija.
Just what we should be.	Biss dak li għandna nkunu.
Everything you do.	Dak kollu li tagħmel.
But we have a lot of friends here.	Imma għandna ħafna ħbieb hawn.
But it can be, it can be anyone.	Imma tassew jista’ jkun, jista’ jkun xi ħadd.
Work is always there.	Ix-xogħol dejjem ikun hemm.
And why this hadn’t happened before.	U għaliex dan ma kienx ġara qabel.
No one here knows how to do that.	Ħadd hawn ma jaf kif jagħmel dan.
I wonder why not just once.	Qed nistaqsi għaliex mhux darba biss.
This is what we know.	Dan huwa dak li nafu.
I have work in the morning.	Għandi xogħol filgħodu.
This is how it can work.	Dan huwa kif jista 'jaħdem.
From now on they were his.	Minn issa kienu tiegħu.
This is a very long time.	Dan huwa żmien twil ħafna.
One thing we can do.	Ħaġa waħda nistgħu nagħmlu.
That’s what you’re supposed to do.	Dak hu li suppost tagħmel.
You’ve always been so easy.	Int dejjem kont daqshekk faċli.
I can say that.	Nista' ngħid dan.
I wonder how long it will take this.	Nistaqsi kemm se tieħu dan.
She knew he needed help.	Kienet taf li kellu bżonn l-għajnuna.
We were just.	Konna biss.
But it looks good.	Imma jidher tajjeb.
This is really why.	Dan huwa verament għaliex.
You didn't think so.	Inti ma ħsibt.
You were the problem.	Int kont il-problema.
This was not easy.	Dan ma kienx faċli.
There is nothing there.	M'hemm xejn hemmhekk.
I would like to know what it is.	Nixtieq inkun naf x'inhu.
I'm sure it won't.	Jien ċert li mhux se.
Most people don't.	Ħafna nies ma.
I’m not sure what it is.	M'inix ċert x'inhu.
Sorry for you.	Jiddispjaċini għalik.
You are not ready.	M'intix lest.
I just don’t know how to do that.	Jien biss ma nafx kif nagħmel hekk.
He didn’t know it would be the last time.	Ma kienx jaf li se tkun l-aħħar darba.
He came to help.	Ġie biex jgħin.
I was too late.	Kont tard wisq.
He wasn’t sure how they felt about it.	Ma kienx ċert kif ħassu dwar dan.
We want to be better.	Irridu nkunu aħjar.
I have to do well.	Ikolli nagħmel tajjeb.
Well there you said it for me.	Tajjeb hemm għidt għalija.
Not too much of anything out there.	Mhux wisq minn xejn hemmhekk.
She was on to something.	Hija kienet fuq xi ħaġa.
I did a lot for myself.	Għamilt ħafna għalija.
He knew he could never go back.	Kien jaf li qatt ma seta’ jmur lura.
This has happened a few times now.	Dan ġara ftit drabi issa.
That's good enough.	Dak tajjeb biżżejjed.
Now there was no time to think.	Issa ma kienx hemm ħin biex taħseb.
I’ve done this before.	Jien għamilt dan qabel.
Do it as follows.	Jagħmel dan kif ġej.
This did nothing.	Dan ma għamel xejn.
That was one.	Dik kienet waħda.
One is not.	Wieħed mhux.
She had to stay here.	Kellha toqgħod hawn.
I tell you in the morning.	Ngħidlek filgħodu.
I still do today.	Għadni llum.
Or eat you.	Jew tiekol int.
She will not eat.	Hi mhux se tiekol.
But right now, you’re not doing anything like that.	Imma bħalissa, mhux qed tagħmel xejn bħal dan.
He never had, and probably never had.	Qatt ma kellu, u probabbilment qatt ma kellu.
Now it is too late.	Issa huwa tard wisq.
Not alone, alone.	Mhux waħdu, waħdu.
He fears that alone is not enough.	Jibża’ li hu waħdu mhux biżżejjed.
As he would later say.	Kif kien jgħid aktar tard.
That’s the only way it happens.	Dak hu l-uniku mod kif jiġri.
It may be already too late.	Jista 'jkun diġà tard wisq.
It could be a big one.	Jista 'jkun wieħed kbir.
They were the same man.	Kienu l-istess raġel.
So tired of this.	Hekk għajjien minn dan.
But he wasn’t ready, not yet.	Imma ma kienx lest, għadu mhux.
He was so small, after all.	Huwa kien daqshekk żgħir, wara kollox.
I loved my dog.	Kont inħobb il-kelb tiegħi.
I, for one.	Jien, għal waħda.
He looked at me.	Huwa ħares lili.
One for him.	Waħda għalih.
But he was here.	Imma kien hawn.
He is not alone.	Hu mhux waħdu.
Maybe, but probably not.	Forsi, imma probabbilment le.
This definitely needed some time.	Dan żgur kien jeħtieġ xi żmien.
I had to listen.	Kelli nisma’.
No one seems interested.	Ħadd ma jidher interessat.
The two are the same thing.	It-tnejn huma l-istess ħaġa.
But it doesn’t have to.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn.
It's hard to see.	Huwa diffiċli biex tara.
But she knows everything.	Imma hi taf dak kollu.
They are all together all the time.	Huma kollha flimkien il-ħin kollu.
He will be back soon.	Huwa ser jiġi lura dalwaqt.
Not so for everyone.	Mhux hekk għal kulħadd.
I'm back here now.	Jien lura hawn issa.
But that’s not what it is.	Imma dan mhuwiex dak li hi.
But it will be too late.	Imma se jkun tard wisq.
But he doesn’t seem happy.	Imma ma jidhirx kuntent.
But you have another.	Imma għandek ieħor.
She knew where she was.	Kienet taf fejn kienet.
It may not be so.	Jista 'ma jkunx hekk.
I wasn’t there, after all.	Jien ma kontx hemm, wara kollox.
That should have been hours ago.	Dak kellu jkun sigħat ilu.
There was no one else to do it.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor biex jagħmel dan.
It works fast.	Jaħdem malajr.
I never wanted to tell you that.	Qatt ma ridt ngħidlek hekk.
I would be watching that.	Jien inkun qed nara dak.
You were coming through that door.	Int kont ġej minn dak il-bieb.
But this never happens.	Imma dan qatt ma jiġri.
I was busy and he was busy.	Jien kont okkupat u hu kien okkupat.
I'm just tired now.	Jien biss għajjien issa.
You did it all.	Inti għamilt dan kollu.
This too.	Dan ukoll.
But that’s just me.	Imma dak jien biss.
He was worried too.	Kien inkwetat ukoll.
There was little to see.	Ftit kien hemm x’tara.
That seems to be about it.	Dan jidher li huwa dwar dan.
Nobody is happy, but nobody can do anything about it.	Ħadd mhu kuntent, imma ħadd ma jista’ jagħmel xejn dwarha.
I just think it will.	Naħseb biss li se.
You can’t do this alone.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan waħdek.
I should be so happy.	Għandi nkun daqshekk kuntent.
I know it wasn’t easy.	Naf li ma kienx faċli.
You know, but it’s my job.	Taf, imma huwa xogħol tiegħi.
He looked bad.	Huwa ħares ħażin.
Now there is nothing.	Issa m'hemm xejn.
All on your own, no help from me.	Kollox waħdek, l-ebda għajnuna minni.
.	.
So.	Hekk.
It was a lot of things.	Kienet ħafna affarijiet.
You, with me.	Int, miegħi.
I will do that again.	Se nerġa' nagħmel dan.
He really wasn’t doing anything right now.	Huwa verament ma kien qed jagħmel xejn bħalissa.
I can't understand.	Ma nistax nista' nifhem.
That maybe he would live forever.	Li forsi kien jgħix għal dejjem.
Look at this because.	Ħares lejn dan għaliex.
I still don’t think so.	Għadni ma naħsibx.
It was ahead of time.	Kien qabel iż-żmien.
Someone else did.	Xi ħadd ieħor għamel.
Sometimes, it does.	Xi drabi, hekk jagħmel.
And in fact there is no problem.	U fil-fatt m'hemm l-ebda problema.
I have a job for you.	Għandi xogħol għalik.
Harder than he needed to be, maybe.	Aktar diffiċli milli kellu bżonn, forsi.
It's really quite easy.	Huwa verament pjuttost faċli.
There just has to be everything or nothing.	Hemm biss trid tkun kollox jew xejn.
He knew a lot.	Kien jaf ħafna.
I have enough.	Għandi biżżejjed.
And it happened.	U ġara.
And you wanted the same.	U int ridt l-istess.
The only problem is.	L-unika problema hija.
And not good.	U mhux tajjeb.
Something has to be.	Xi ħaġa trid tkun.
Well, she's being so.	Ukoll, hi qed tkun hekk.
Too many things.	Wisq affarijiet.
It's like.	Huwa bħal .
It's so much easier that way.	Huwa ħafna aktar faċli hekk.
And likely more than once.	U probabbli aktar minn darba.
But a good one.	Imma waħda tajba.
I have the same problem.	Qed ikolli l-istess problema.
A little better.	Ftit aħjar.
But there was something about this time.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa dwar dan iż-żmien.
We can never.	Nistgħu qatt.
And not the only one who said that.	U mhux l-uniku wieħed li qal dan.
I make mine.	Jiena nagħmel tiegħi.
But that may not do anything for me.	Imma dan jista 'ma jagħmel xi ħaġa għalija.
He had a really good year.	Huwa kellu sena tassew tajba.
Maybe so.	Forsi jista’ jkun ukoll.
It's another morning.	Huwa filgħodu ieħor.
And in fact this is about it.	U fil-fatt dan huwa dwar dan.
Not like the previous one.	Mhux bħal dik ta’ qabel għamlet.
This is a difficult time for us.	Dan huwa żmien diffiċli għalina.
Most people don't.	Ħafna nies ma.
But at the time, it seemed like a big deal.	Imma dak iż-żmien, deher qisu ħaġa kbira.
I’m not sure he is.	M'inix ċert li hu.
No one else can do that.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jagħmel dan.
This happened here.	Dan ġara hawn.
And it’s nothing wrong.	U mhu xejn ħażin.
I had thought of everything.	Kont ħsibt kollox.
So it had to be.	Hekk kellu jkun.
If you want to talk, you can.	Jekk trid titkellem, tista’.
He may have done so.	Jista’ jkun li għamel hekk.
I’ve never done anything like this either.	Jien qatt ma għamilt xi ħaġa bħal din lanqas.
That everything works fine.	Li kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
He never went back home.	Hu qatt ma mar lura d-dar.
You really can.	Inti verament tista '.
He seems to know too much.	Jidher li jaf wisq.
He knew where he was going from here.	Kien jaf fejn imur minn hawn.
We needed more.	Kellna bżonn aktar.
I suspect there is.	Nissuspetta li hemm.
We'll do just that.	Aħna ser nagħmlu biss dak.
But everyone was having fun.	Imma kulħadd kien qed jieħu gost.
And all this.	U dan kollu.
Only now did she need more time.	Biss issa kellha bżonn aktar ħin.
Now don't.	Issa ma.
Not lovers, nothing like that.	Mhux min iħobb, xejn bħal dan.
She doesn’t want to talk.	Hi ma tridx titkellem.
Not everyone can work here.	Mhux kulħadd jista' jaħdem hawn.
Next week, it’s just fine.	Il-ġimgħa d-dieħla, huwa biss tajjeb.
Well, not today, but soon.	Ukoll, mhux illum, imma dalwaqt.
I would be happy.	Inkun kuntent.
I don’t know why this happens.	Ma nafx għalfejn jiġri dan.
Good teacher.	Għalliem tajjeb.
I was everything.	Jien kont kollox.
Later they do well.	Aktar tard jagħmlu tajjeb.
They don’t seem to be there.	Dawn ma jidhirx li hemm.
He said he had.	Qal li kellu.
This was a happy time.	Dan kien żmien kuntent.
He took help.	Huwa ħa għajnuna.
You must want it that way.	Trid trid hekk.
So he did the job.	Hekk għamel ix-xogħol.
And it did.	U dan għamlet.
That’s what I thought.	Huwa dak li ħsibt.
I will tell the truth.	Jien se ngħid il-verità.
But it was not so.	Imma ma kienx hekk.
Time is time.	Iż-żmien huwa żmien.
Everyone is fine.	Kulħadd jinsab tajjeb ħafna.
Not going soon.	Mhux sejjer dalwaqt.
All together now.	Kollha flimkien issa.
That was both good and bad.	Li kien kemm tajjeb kif ukoll ħażin.
I never saw anything.	Qatt ma rajt xejn.
No one knows what that is.	Ħadd ma jaf x'inhu dak.
But it’s still not good enough.	Imma għadu mhux tajjeb biżżejjed.
Nothing goes away forever.	Xejn ma jmur għal dejjem.
You can stay at home.	Tista 'toqgħod id-dar.
She needed to think about things.	Hija kellha bżonn taħseb dwar l-affarijiet.
He shouldn't have done that.	Ma kellux għamel hekk.
I’m not sure where I’m going.	M'inix ċert fejn se mmur.
I came here to.	Ġejt hawn biex.
Everything would be easy.	Kollox ikun faċli.
She really played for me.	Hija verament kellha għalija.
And it was, and it is.	U kien, u huwa.
That was what was here.	Dan kien dak li kien hawn.
In fact, it was good.	Fil-fatt, kien tajjeb.
That really just happened.	Dak verament ġara biss.
He got there before we did.	Wasal hemm qabel ma nagħmlu.
Everything was ready.	Kollox kien lest.
He sat down and thought.	Poġġa bilqiegħda u ħaseb.
It seemed easy.	Huwa deher faċli.
I would like to talk to you more.	Nixtieq nitkellem miegħek aktar.
That was good.	Li kien tajjeb.
As soon as possible.	Kemm jista’ malajr.
This is not the same thing as above.	Din mhix l-istess ħaġa bħal hawn fuq.
You want the truth.	Trid il-verità.
If not, don’t do it.	Jekk le, ma jagħmilx hekk.
It’s time for this to happen.	Wasal iż-żmien li jiġri dan.
He was not worried.	Hu ma kienx inkwetat.
It happened yesterday.	Ġara lbieraħ.
I think it would look better that way.	Naħseb li jkun jidher aħjar hekk.
You haven’t been there that long.	Int ma kontx hemm daqshekk twil.
Everyone sat down.	Kulħadd poġġa bilqiegħda.
Definitely you.	Żgur li int.
Well, that's what you do.	Ukoll, dan huwa dak li tagħmel.
He will be fine.	Hu se jkun tajjeb.
That was it.	Kien dak li kien hemm.
In fact, we are not.	Fil-fatt, aħna le.
The car will be here by tomorrow.	Il-karozza tkun hawn sa għada.
Don't think that.	M'għandekx taħseb li.
I had just gone there.	Kont għadni kemm mort hemm.
There were many.	Kien hemm ħafna.
I didn’t say anything like that.	Jien ma għedt xejn bħal dan.
This will have to do.	Dan ser ikollu jagħmel.
Come to me.	Jiġi għandi.
He will do just that.	Huwa ser jagħmel dan biss.
Ready ?.	Lest?.
Everyone was still busy.	Kulħadd kien għadu okkupat.
In good time.	Fi żmien tajjeb.
No, he couldn't.	Le, ma setax.
You know very well what it was.	Taf tajjeb ħafna dak li kien.
She had a lot of friends there.	Kellha ħafna ħbieb hemmhekk.
For a few years everything is great.	Għal ftit snin kollox huwa kbir.
He would, too.	Kieku, ukoll.
I will always be in love with him.	Jien dejjem inkun inħobb miegħu.
We were going to be a problem.	Konna se nkunu problema.
Well this is what it is.	Ukoll dan huwa dak li hu.
It wasn’t working for me.	Ma kienx qed jaħdem għalija.
Or rather, the house he once had.	Jew aħjar, id-dar li darba kellu.
He's just there.	Huwa biss qiegħed hemm.
Maybe you were right.	Forsi kellek raġun.
And not what you are saying.	U mhux dak li qed tgħid.
This is not enough either.	Dan lanqas mhu biżżejjed.
He just wasn’t able to do it.	Huwa biss ma kienx kapaċi jagħmel dan.
He couldn’t say exactly why.	Ma setax jgħid eżatt għaliex.
You'll be fine.	Int ser tkun tajjeb.
We didn’t even know each other.	Lanqas biss konna nafu lil xulxin.
It happened too fast.	Ġara malajr wisq.
You are the only one for me.	Int l-uniku wieħed għalija.
I want to go with him.	Irrid li tmur miegħu.
I hope today is good for you as well.	Nittama li llum hija tajba għalik ukoll.
Not so, of course.	Mhux hekk, ovvjament.
Not so long ago they were the same.	Mhux daqshekk twil ilu kienu l-istess.
No, he was not here.	Le, ma kienx hawn.
Me, a lot.	Jien, ħafna.
No one had seen anything.	Ħadd ma kien ra xejn.
Obviously he is right.	Ovvjament għandu raġun.
We will not do such a thing.	Mhux se nagħmlu ħaġa bħal din.
Nor was she ready.	Lanqas kienet lest.
John at the time.	John dak iż-żmien.
He can do more.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel aktar.
We know what that is.	Aħna nafu x'inhu dan.
Lots of money.	Ħafna flus.
No one really knew.	Ħadd ma kien jaf tassew.
I'm trying to understand how this can happen.	Qed nipprova nifhem kif dan jista’ jiġri.
It would be great.	Ikun kbir.
It's really not a problem.	Huwa verament mhux problema.
She was like that.	Hija kienet hekk.
I was interested.	Kont interessat.
Maybe there is no problem.	Forsi m'hemm l-ebda problema.
Nothing wrong here.	Xejn ħażin hawn.
I've never heard of this.	Qatt ma smajt b’dan.
She never had that.	Hija qatt ma kellha dik.
This came out.	Dan ħareġ.
We know what’s right for you.	Aħna nafu x'inhu tajjeb għalik.
No he wasn't.	Le hu ma kienx.
Not even a little.	Lanqas ftit.
It was right after.	Kien eżatt wara.
No one else will.	Ħadd ieħor ma se.
It was all great from there.	Kien kollox kbir minn hemm.
I tell you.	Jien ngħidlek.
And, in fact, it is.	U, fil-fatt, huwa.
We need a little more.	Għandna bżonn ftit aktar.
She probably never did.	Hija probabbilment qatt ma.
He had never thought about it before.	Hu qatt ma kellu jaħseb dwarha qabel.
But it was not the time.	Imma ma kienx il-ħin.
There is no more.	Ma jkunx hemm aktar.
No one wins anyone.	Ħadd ma jirbaħ ħadd.
He said nothing was wrong.	Qal li xejn ma kien ħażin.
I would say maybe.	Jien ngħid forsi.
It's not hard.	Mhuwiex diffiċli.
It still wasn’t enough.	Għadu ma kienx biżżejjed.
I wish he was here to see this.	Nixtieq li kien hawn biex jara dan.
Better than that, he’s a great teacher.	Aħjar minn dan, huwa għalliem kbir.
It's in the back.	Huwa fuq wara.
As I said.	Kif għedt.
Maybe it was too much.	Forsi kien wisq.
Pretty early, actually.	Pjuttost kmieni, fil-fatt.
It's not you.	Mhuwiex int.
This is harder to do.	Dan huwa aktar diffiċli biex tagħmel.
You can't just say.	Inti ma tistax tgħid biss.
He will come.	Hu se jiġi.
They were all there.	Kienu kollha hemm.
So it happened to me.	Hekk ġara lili.
Together with everyone.	Flimkien ma’ kulħadd.
And this is working.	U dan qed jaħdem.
It seems like yesterday to me.	Jidher li lbieraħ għalija.
Stay tuned today.	Illum jibqa’ hemm.
I doubt much of that.	Niddubita ħafna minn hekk.
Nor was it so difficult.	Lanqas ma kien daqshekk diffiċli.
I will try so.	Se nipprova hekk.
He's back.	Huwa jerġa' lura.
That’s not that hard.	Dak mhux daqshekk diffiċli.
He said many good things.	Huwa qal ħafna affarijiet tajba.
He came back a few hours later.	Huwa ġie lura ftit sigħat wara.
In fact I have.	Fil-fatt għandi.
We did a lot.	Għamilna ħafna.
She wouldn’t want that.	Hija ma tkunx trid dan.
Neither do I.	Lanqas jien ma rridx.
I will be back soon for more.	Se nerġa' dalwaqt għal aktar.
He is not a bad man.	Huwa mhux raġel ħażin.
And they never have that out there.	U qatt ma għandhom dak hemmhekk.
These are the last things.	Dawn huma l-aħħar affarijiet.
You as you wish.	Int kif trid.
You never are.	Inti qatt.
But this is not so.	Imma dan mhux hekk.
I will have to do it again.	Ikolli nerġa' nagħmel.
If you wish.	Jekk tixtieq.
I hope you can do the same.	Jien nittama li tista' tagħmel l-istess.
I saw for that.	Rajt għal dak.
Nothing looked wrong.	Xejn ma deher ħażin.
It will take a while to know for sure.	Ser tieħu ftit biex tkun taf żgur.
Usually this was not a problem.	Normalment din ma kinitx problema.
For each other.	Għal xulxin.
This is all yours.	Dan huwa kollu tiegħek.
That could be a good thing.	Li tista’ tkun xi ħaġa tajba.
That won’t be me.	Dak mhux se nkun jien.
I do a good job.	Nagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
Well, he's back.	Ukoll, huwa lura.
But not everything.	Imma mhux kollox.
But it will soon be around.	Imma dalwaqt se jiġi madwar.
Everything was fine there.	Kollox kien tajjeb hemmhekk.
Or better yet, don’t talk.	Jew aħjar, ma titkellem.
She knew she needed to do something about it.	Kienet taf li kellha bżonn tagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
But she wouldn’t be seeing any of this.	Imma hi ma tkun qed tara xejn minn dan.
I did a very good job.	Għamilt xogħol tajjeb ħafna.
It’s hard to do that.	Huwa diffiċli li tagħmel dan.
He was.	Huwa kien.
It was very fast.	Kien malajr ħafna.
You are not the same.	M'intix l-istess.
But you can't.	Imma ma tistax.
And there was no money.	U ma kien hemm xejn flus.
This is obviously a very good thing.	Din hija ovvjament ħaġa tajba ħafna.
You have no idea where you are.	M'għandekx idea fejn int.
There are three problems.	Hemm tliet problemi.
And you never know where it comes from.	U qatt ma tkun taf minn fejn ġej.
I think this book helps.	Naħseb li dan il-ktieb jgħin.
It’s good for that.	Huwa tajjeb għal dan.
Well, too bad.	Ukoll, ħażin wisq.
I don’t even talk like that.	Lanqas nitkellem hekk.
But it doesn’t appear.	Imma ma jidhirx.
It seems harder.	Jidher aktar diffiċli.
She is all the same person.	Hija kollha l-istess persuna.
He is not happy.	Hu mhux kuntent.
They do things.	Huma jagħmlu affarijiet.
He said he does.	Huwa qal li jagħmel.
We have to go now.	Irridu mmorru issa.
I hope it’s better now.	Nispera li huwa aħjar issa.
This we already knew.	Dan diġà konna nafu.
This happened very quickly.	Dan ġara malajr ħafna.
Still here.	Għadha hawn.
I couldn’t think where I should go.	Ma stajtx naħseb fejn għandi mmur.
And you were.	U int kont.
It often doesn’t.	Ħafna drabi ma jagħmilx hekk.
But he really knows what he wants.	Imma tassew jaf xi jrid.
But it can't be.	Imma ma jistax ikun.
I take what you say well.	Nieħu dak li tgħid tajjeb.
And no one really knows that.	U ħadd ma jaf verament dan.
You see what you need to see.	Inti tara dak li għandek bżonn biex tara.
The afternoon is mine.	Wara nofsinhar hi tiegħi.
I actually did that.	Jien fil-fatt għamilt dan.
After all, she knew a lot.	Wara kollox, kienet taf ħafna.
I hope it stays around.	Nittama li jibqa' madwar.
I always want to do something else.	Jien dejjem irrid nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
Nothing had come out.	Ma kien ħareġ xejn.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
Well, there wasn’t much.	Ukoll, ma kienx hemm ħafna.
I never have an idea.	Qatt ma għandi idea.
You can get what you really want any way you want.	Tista 'tieħu dak verament kull mod trid.
You can see that.	Tista 'tara li.
Being alone is not a problem for me.	Li nkun waħdi mhix problema għalija.
I want it to work for everyone !.	Irrid li jaħdem għal kulħadd!.
He will be happy with me.	Hu se jkun kuntent miegħi.
Look, there.	Ħares, hemmhekk.
We would not be here at all.	Aħna ma nkunu hawn xejn.
I never thought it would be so good.	Qatt ma ħsibt li jista’ jkun daqshekk tajjeb.
He just doesn’t like to say.	Huwa biss ma jħobbx jgħid.
It was home here.	Kien id-dar hawn.
I need to understand.	Għandi bżonn nifhem.
That, you think, was enough.	Dan, taħseb, kien biżżejjed.
We were doing all this very well.	Konna nagħmlu dan kollu tajjeb ħafna.
You’re happy too.	Int kuntent ukoll.
They were there yesterday.	Kienu hemm ilbieraħ.
When in fact you can't do it.	Meta fil-fatt inti ma tistax tagħmel dan.
It was something he often did and couldn’t help.	Kienet xi ħaġa li spiss jagħmel u ma setax jgħin.
Or maybe that was someone else.	Jew forsi dak kien xi ħadd ieħor.
Not enough to eat.	Mhux biżżejjed biex tiekol.
Not the same.	Mhux l-istess.
It was more.	Kien aktar.
But it was wrong.	Imma kien ħażin.
Or maybe I am.	Jew forsi jien.
You are too long.	Inti twil wisq.
Now they are just people.	Issa huma biss nies.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Forsi, forsi, forsi.
That’s what happened right now.	Huwa dak li ġara bħalissa.
But it is nothing.	Imma mhu xejn.
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
That's probably where it is.	Dak huwa probabbilment fejn huwa.
Now, on and on.	Issa, fuq u fuq.
No, nothing.	L-ebda, xejn.
Sometimes so, often not so.	Xi drabi hekk, spiss ma jagħmilx hekk.
Everyone seems to know something.	Kulħadd jidher li jaf xi ħaġa.
Not a good idea.	Mhix idea tajba.
It was good.	Ġie tajjeb.
It didn't look like much.	Ma tantx deher.
Or do whatever they do.	Jew jagħmlu dak kollu li jagħmlu.
Here they are right here.	Hawn huma eżatt hawn.
Who is ours.	Min tagħna.
He was always doing that.	Dejjem kien qed jagħmel hekk.
He is right that it will not be easy.	Għandu raġun li mhux se jkun faċli.
Today in time.	Illum fi żmien.
Someone is still there.	Xi ħadd għadu hemm.
He was doing everything and everything for me.	Kien jagħmel kollox u kollox għalija.
Well, we can't.	Ukoll, ma nistgħux.
He can wait.	Jista’ jistenna.
I wasn’t alone for a long time.	Jien ma kontx waħdi għal żmien twil.
I think it went well.	Naħseb li mar tajjeb.
This takes a lot of time.	Dan jieħu ħafna ħin.
It couldn’t be, but it was there.	Ma setax ikun, imma kien hemm.
Well that's how it started.	Ukoll hekk beda.
In fact, it had already begun.	Fil-fatt, kien diġà beda.
He was never alone, never alone.	Qatt ma kien għadu, qatt ma kien waħdu.
I needed to know a lot more.	Kelli bżonn inkun naf ħafna aktar.
He didn’t want to be here.	Ma riedx ikun hawn.
I still haven't heard anything.	Għadni ma stajt nisma’ xejn.
I can’t understand how I do that.	Ma nistax nifhem kif nagħmel dan.
I was staying with him.	Jien kont noqgħod miegħu.
He is not speaking.	Hu mhux qed jitkellem.
It was quite late.	Kien pjuttost tard.
Don't do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan.
Definitely do that.	Żgur li tagħmel dan.
I was never on one.	Qatt ma kont fuq waħda.
I’m good at this.	Jien tajjeb b'dan.
It didn’t seem to be there now.	Ma deherx li kien hemm issa.
No one ever does.	Ħadd qatt ma jagħmel.
He didn’t have much.	Ma kellux ħafna.
You did your thing.	Inti għamilt ħaġa tiegħek.
I think it will be good.	Naħseb li se jkun tajjeb.
It probably was him.	Probabbilment kien hu.
I will try to do better.	Se nipprova nagħmel aħjar.
I just don’t want to go now.	Jien biss ma rridx immur issa.
If and when it does.	Jekk u meta jagħmel.
John was not happy.	John ma kienx kuntent.
I saw too much.	Rajt wisq.
I had to do more.	I kellha tagħmel aktar.
You’re going, you know.	Int sejjer, taf.
I so didn’t know this.	Jien hekk ma kontx naf dan.
I think there is about.	Naħseb li hemm madwar.
Neither is she.	Lanqas hi.
It comes around.	Jiġi madwar.
This can be wrong.	Dan jista 'jkun ħażin.
It could have been his.	Seta’ kien tiegħu.
And so it was.	U hekk kien.
Not yet.	Għadu mhux hekk.
But not the last.	Imma mhux l-aħħar.
You should see my house.	Għandek tara d-dar tiegħi.
And she always will be.	U hi dejjem tkun.
I’m glad this will be my home.	Jien ferħan li din se tkun id-dar tiegħi.
I don’t know I love anyone.	Ma naf inħobb lil ħadd.
As you say, you’re just a kid.	Kif tgħid, int biss tifel.
He will not be a problem.	Hu mhux se jkun problema.
I needed time alone.	Jien kelli bżonn il-ħin waħdi.
No one asked that.	Ħadd ma staqsa dan.
This cannot be.	Dan ma jistax ikun.
That’s really bad.	Dak hu tassew ħażin.
Very bad idea.	Idea ħażina ħafna.
I want you to be with me.	Irrid li tkun miegħi.
There had to be more than that.	Kellu jkun hemm aktar minn hekk.
He is ready.	Huwa lest.
I just need to sit down for a while.	Għandi bżonn biss noqgħod bilqiegħda għal ftit.
There is no one else around.	M'hemm ħadd ieħor madwar.
But not very much.	Imma ma tantx.
No not good.	Le mhux tajjeb.
It has another.	Għandu ieħor.
We don’t need that now.	M'għandniex bżonn dak issa.
But they were there.	Imma kienu hemm.
There are quite a few.	Hemm pjuttost ftit.
One way to do this.	Mod wieħed biex isir dan.
We know who they are.	Nafu min huma.
About time, too.	Dwar iż-żmien, ukoll.
I wasn't scared either.	Jien lanqas kont nibża’.
That went well.	Li mar tajjeb.
No one else could either.	Ħadd ieħor ma setax lanqas.
Someone is in my room and sees me.	Xi ħadd qiegħed fil-kamra tiegħi u jara lili.
We were both, like.	Konna t-tnejn konna, bħal.
I know you can do that.	Naf li tista’ tagħmel dan.
They are the same size.	Huma l-istess daqs.
I have one from a long time ago.	Għandi waħda minn żmien twil ilu.
It's been a long time.	Ilu żmien twil.
I need to be glad.	Għandi bżonn li jkun ferħan.
You said nothing wrong.	Inti għidt xejn ħażin.
I want us to be together.	Irrid li nkunu flimkien.
If nothing went wrong.	Jekk xejn ma mar ħażin.
He was really tired.	Kien tassew għajjien.
It needs money.	Jeħtieġ flus.
She knows everything.	Hija taf kollox.
Which, of course, is not.	Li, ovvjament, mhuwiex.
It is always so.	Huwa dejjem hekk.
It’s still good, though.	Għadu tajjeb, imma .
But all was well.	Imma kollox kien tajjeb.
He will never be again.	Hu qatt ma jerġa’ jkun.
You don't seem to be.	Inti ma jidhirx li tkun.
I think it should probably be.	Naħseb li għandu jkun probabbilment.
It was only here, now.	Kien hemm biss hawn, issa.
She can do it.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan.
That was all.	Dak kien kollu.
Morning was done in the afternoon.	Filgħodu sar wara nofsinhar.
Probably a man.	Probabbilment raġel.
She doesn’t do that anymore.	Hija ma tagħmilx hekk aktar.
But it may not be.	Imma jista 'ma jkunx.
You can go to him.	Tista’ tmur għandu.
You could say it's good.	Inti tista 'tgħid li huwa tajjeb.
The same thing is happening.	Qed jiġri l-istess.
We have this too.	Għandna dan ukoll.
It hasn’t been there before.	Ma kienx hemm qabel.
But nothing came.	Imma xejn ma ġie.
But that’s just me.	Imma dak jien biss.
I did the same thing over and over.	Għamilt l-istess ħaġa aktar u aktar.
You need.	Għandek bżonn .
She did nothing.	Ma għamlet xejn.
Tell no one.	Għid lil ħadd.
She was having fun.	Kienet tieħu gost.
It is our only chance.	Huwa l-uniku ċans tagħna.
He was not the only one.	Ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
He was going to do something about it.	Kien se jagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
Not that it’s a bad idea.	Mhux li hija idea ħażina.
I could never expect anything more.	Qatt ma stajt nistenna xejn aktar.
I can try myself.	Nista' nipprova jien.
I just have to say this.	Għandi biss ngħid dan.
I had no idea myself.	Jien ma kellix idea jien.
It's very good.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna.
I was at school.	Kont l-iskola.
That was probably good.	Dak probabbilment kien tajjeb.
We do this as follows.	Aħna nagħmlu dan kif ġej.
First, nothing happens alone.	L-ewwel, xejn ma jiġri waħdu.
She had no need.	Ma kellha l-ebda bżonn.
This problem is a big one to go to.	Din il-problema hija waħda kbira biex wieħed imur.
I’m having a good time.	Qed nagħmel ħin tajjeb.
And this is really difficult.	U dan huwa tassew diffiċli.
I hope you can be happy someday.	Nittama li tista’ tkun kuntent xi darba.
Many times I did.	Ħafna drabi għamilt.
Not too much seems to help.	Mhux wisq jidher li jgħin.
But he wasn’t saying anything about it.	Imma ma kien qed jgħid xejn dwarha.
And it certainly was.	U żgur li kien.
Supposedly.	Suppost.
Someone wants to know.	Xi ħadd irid ikun jaf.
There is only one thing we can do now.	Hemm ħaġa waħda biss li nistgħu nagħmlu issa.
Something wrong is happening.	Qed jiġri xi ħaġa ħażina.
And apparently, he was right.	U milli jidher, kellu raġun.
You don’t have to do everything on your own.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel kollox waħdek.
Nobody at all.	Ħadd xejn.
Much, much more.	Ħafna, ħafna aktar.
Something for everyone there !.	Xi ħaġa għal kulħadd hemm!.
And as he said, so it should be.	U kif qal, hekk għandu jkun.
It may not happen to you quickly.	Jista 'ma jiġri għalik malajr.
It just won’t happen.	Huwa biss mhux se jiġri.
Sorry for everything that happened.	Jiddispjaċini għal dak kollu li ġara.
And it was, and it was.	U kien, u kien.
That was everyone.	Dan kien kulħadd.
I think he was right.	Naħseb li kellu raġun.
You seem to know a lot about it.	Inti tidher li taf ħafna dwar dan.
He seems to have done so.	Jidher li hekk għamel.
I wanted to know.	Ridt inkun naf.
You are no better than he is.	M'intix aħjar milli hu.
It goes back a long time.	Jmur lura żmien twil.
You don't.	Inti ma .
It was going to be good.	Kien se jkun tajjeb.
Or it won't.	Jew mhux se.
And you don’t have to do that.	U m'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel dan.
So it's supposed to go.	Hekk suppost tmur.
He didn’t have time to think about it.	Ma kellux ħin biex jaħseb dwarha.
So much had happened.	Tant kien ġara.
There was nothing he could do about it now.	Ma kien hemm xejn li jista 'jagħmel dwar dan issa.
There is no one here at all.	M'hemm ħadd hawn xejn.
It just seemed so small.	Huwa biss deher daqshekk żgħir.
But there was something else about it.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra dwarha.
You have such a good one.	Għandek waħda daqshekk tajba.
She was obviously a beautiful person.	Kienet ovvjament persuna sabiħa.
And it happened so fast.	U ġara hekk malajr.
But maybe it went wrong.	Imma forsi ħa ħażin.
I would say it’s too good.	Jien ngħid li huwa tajjeb wisq.
I hope we are friends.	Nispera li nkunu ħbieb.
I was thinking and thinking about it.	Jien kont qed naħseb u naħseb dwarha.
After all it works well.	Wara kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
This will not be quite.	Dan mhux se jkun pjuttost.
There was that.	Kien hemm dak.
No, no.	Le, mhux.
This can happen quite quickly.	Dan jista' jiġri pjuttost malajr.
What she did.	Dak li għamlet.
Never too much of a good thing.	Qatt wisq ta 'ħaġa tajba.
I know a lot about it, but definitely not everything.	Naf ħafna dwarha, imma żgur mhux kollox.
That will not be enough.	Dan mhux se jkun biżżejjed.
She never had time.	Qatt ma kellha ħin.
Try it here.	Jipprova hawn.
I had a better idea.	Kelli idea aħjar.
This seemed to be happening more and more.	Dan deher li qed jiġri dejjem aktar.
Everyone here knows this.	Kulħadd hawn jaf dan.
He could tell.	Huwa seta 'jgħid.
We are the first people.	Aħna l-ewwel nies.
And she wasn’t home.	U hi ma kinitx id-dar.
Nobody knows everything.	Ħadd ma jaf kollox.
I would say the last one.	Jien ngħid li l-aħħar waħda.
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t.	Ma nistax, ma nistax, ma nistax.
I know you can.	Naf li tista’.
This is until someone wants something for nothing.	Dan sakemm xi ħadd irid xi ħaġa għal xejn.
The book is so good.	Il-ktieb huwa daqshekk tajjeb.
And he said he was going to go get help.	U qal li kien se jmur jieħu l-għajnuna.
You know what happened next.	Taf x’ġara wara.
It looks good.	Jidher tajjeb.
It's all she is.	Huwa għal kollox hi.
I think they should.	Naħseb li għandhom.
He wasn’t quite sure.	Ma kienx pjuttost ċert.
They are all over that.	Huma kollha fuq dak.
Anything they need, we can do.	Kull ħaġa li għandhom bżonn, nistgħu nagħmlu.
He should be tired.	Għandu jkun għajjien.
They were, in fact, much more.	Kienu, fil-fatt, ħafna aktar.
And he was sure to come back.	U kien ċert li jerġa’ lura.
But not entirely bad.	Imma mhux għal kollox ħażin.
It wasn’t so bad.	Ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
He is doing his best.	Qed jagħmel minn kollox.
I thought I was.	Ħsibt li kont.
I went wrong.	Jien mort ħażin.
Not forever, but more.	Mhux għal dejjem, imma aktar.
There is no way he knows.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li jaf.
He didn’t want help.	Ma riedx għajnuna.
That would be just today.	Dan ikun biss illum.
So far this is it.	Sa issa dan hu.
Not until noon.	Mhux sa nofsinhar.
Doing so seems to help a little.	Li tagħmel dan jidher li jgħin ftit.
I must have done something good.	I għandu għamilt xi ħaġa tajba.
Once, there was.	Darba, kien hemm.
Obviously, nothing had happened.	Ovvjament, ma kien ġara xejn.
But now was not the time.	Imma issa ma kienx iż-żmien.
You are out of here.	Inti barra minn hawn.
On and around.	Fuq u madwar.
But it almost happened.	Imma kważi ġara.
I was a little surprised.	Kont xi ftit sorpriż.
He didn’t have to come back here.	Ma kellux jiġi lura hawn.
I thought it would help.	Ħsibt li se jgħin.
This is just one person.	Din hija persuna waħda biss.
Not sure how it looks.	Għadu mhux ċert kif jidher.
But that was good.	Imma dan kien tajjeb.
He needs everyone.	Jeħtieġ lil kulħadd.
I didn’t.	Jien ma kontx.
It was good.	Kienet tajjeb.
This will work.	Dan se jaħdem.
But he was not like a person.	Imma ma kienx bħal persuna.
I will definitely stay there again.	Żgur li se nerġa' noqgħod hemm.
If something happens, it happens.	Jekk jiġri xi ħaġa, jiġri.
A friend said.	Ħabib qal.
Try things.	Jipprova l-affarijiet.
And this, it seemed, was that.	U dan, deher, kien dak.
He needs something more.	Huwa għandu bżonn xi ħaġa aktar.
I think? 	Naħseb?
Now they are better.	Issa huma aħjar.
Most people do.	Ħafna nies jagħmlu.
Maybe this seems a little long.	Forsi dan jidher ftit twil.
And there is nothing you can do.	U m'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel.
She did a lot for me.	Hija għamlet ħafna għalija.
You know, and it was.	Taf, u kienet.
He didn’t want to know everything about her.	Ma riedx ikun jaf kollox dwarha.
He will not come back.	Hu mhux se jiġi lura.
You have to do it for me.	Inti għandek tagħmel dan għalija.
If something like that ever came out.	Jekk xi ħaġa bħal dik qatt ħareġ.
Soon I was tired.	Dalwaqt kont għajjien.
This does not seem likely.	Dan ma jidhirx probabbli.
He did very well there.	Huwa għamel tajjeb ħafna hemmhekk.
I think she was right.	Naħseb li kellha raġun.
I'm as happy as I can be.	Jien kuntent kemm jista’ jkun.
It was very bad.	Kien ħażin ħafna.
But not her.	Imma mhux hi.
But his friend was too quick.	Imma ħabib tiegħu kien malajr wisq.
And there are many.	U hemm ħafna.
Not really good, as it happened.	Mhux tassew tajjeb, kif ġara.
Everyone was ready again.	Kulħadd kien lest mill-ġdid.
There is nothing to do.	Mhu xejn li tagħmel.
She was never alone.	Hija qatt ma kienet waħedha.
Ask how much he couldn’t see.	Staqsa kemm ma setax jara.
I thought for sure that was it.	Ħsibt żgur li dan kien.
He’s taking a chance as well.	Huwa qed jieħu ċans ukoll.
There are already many people who do this.	Diġà hemm ħafna nies li jagħmlu dan.
And everyone.	U kulħadd.
You are not here to think.	M'intix hawn biex taħseb.
But there is nothing, nobody.	Imma m'hemm xejn, ħadd.
It can take a long time.	Jista 'jieħu żmien twil.
There must be truth.	Għandu jkun hemm il-verità.
He just needed to get there.	Huwa biss kellu bżonn jasal hemm.
It really couldn’t be easier.	Verament ma jistax ikun aktar faċli.
But something tells me it wasn’t.	Imma xi ħaġa tgħidli li ma kinitx.
They were almost friends.	Kienu kważi ħbieb.
I want it to be.	Irrid li jkun.
It was long enough for that.	Kien twil biżżejjed għal dan.
Where are you currently ?.	Fejn int bħalissa?.
You will be happy.	Int ser tkun kuntent.
No one passed me by.	Ħadd ma għadda minni.
It’s always going to go.	Dejjem sejjer sejjer sejjer.
He may know someone.	Jista’ jkun jaf lil xi ħadd.
I can talk to him.	Nista’ nitkellem miegħu.
Just nothing happens.	Biss ma jiġri xejn.
Not too much at all.	Mhux wisq xejn.
Let's go back.	Ejja mmorru lura.
I’ve always been small.	Jien dejjem kont żgħir.
They have what they need.	Għandhom dak li għandhom bżonn.
She knows everything about anyone.	Hija taf kollox dwar kull min hu xi ħadd.
I know this will work.	Naf li dan se jaħdem.
I made mine.	Jien għamilt tiegħi.
Everything is wrong, wrong, wrong.	Kollox ħażin, ħażin, ħażin.
I think it should be more.	Naħseb li għandu jkun aktar.
I need another one.	Għandi bżonn wieħed ieħor.
Not actually.	Mhux fil-fatt.
Not for more than a year.	Mhux għal aktar minn sena.
He was not a bad man.	Ma kienx raġel ħażin.
It will probably do well.	Hija probabbilment se tagħmel tajjeb.
It started earlier.	Beda qabel.
I want more than anything.	Irrid aktar minn kull ħaġa.
It was easier to do than not.	Kien aktar faċli li tagħmel milli le.
Better than ever.	Aħjar milli qatt kien.
I have to.	Ikolli.
But they are.	Imma huma.
This was so easy.	Dan kien daqshekk faċli.
Why did this never leave ?.	Għaliex dan qatt ma telaq?.
We never seem to have enough time together.	Qatt ma jidher li għandna ħin biżżejjed flimkien.
Do not do this until you are ready.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan sakemm tkun lest.
But nothing works for me.	Imma xejn ma jaħdem għalija.
You just be there.	Inti biss tkun hemm.
She had many friends.	Kellha ħafna ħbieb.
Nobody knows what you're really thinking.	Ħadd ma jaf x’qed taħseb tassew.
So much for sure.	Tant huwa ċert.
No, no, that’s not for me.	Le, le, dak mhux għalija.
We were always together.	Dejjem konna flimkien.
He had.	Kellu.
It was time to leave.	Kien wasal iż-żmien li jitlaq.
It was a pretty bad year.	Kienet sena pjuttost ħażina.
I think first.	Naħseb li l-ewwel.
I was at work.	Kont fuq ix-xogħol.
What will we do with you.	X'se nagħmlu miegħek.
This was not working properly.	Dan ma kienx qed jaħdem kif suppost.
He was doing it.	Huwa kien qed jagħmel dan.
Time passed too quickly.	Iż-żmien għadda malajr wisq.
We have done this many times.	Ħafna drabi għamilna dan.
They were nothing.	Ma kienu xejn.
You know where you are.	Taf fejn int.
And this too.	U dan ukoll.
You are my good friend.	Inti ħabib tajjeb tiegħi.
It was still too early for anyone to be there.	Kien għadu kmieni wisq biex xi ħadd ikun hemm.
But not yet.	Imma għadu mhux.
He never went back.	Hu qatt ma mar lura.
He doesn’t even know what he wants.	Lanqas ma jaf xi jrid.
No one, really, was good enough.	Ħadd, tassew, ma kien tajjeb biżżejjed.
I was already thinking about something else.	Diġà kont qed naħseb fuq xi ħaġa oħra.
It's both.	Huwa t-tnejn.
This will take a while.	Dan se jieħu ftit.
I am trying to understand this.	Qed nipprova nifhem dan.
I think it would look good.	Naħseb li jkun jidher tajjeb.
It's for you or for.	Huwa għalik jew għal.
But other times.	Imma drabi oħra.
He can stay here.	Huwa jista 'jibqa' hawn.
I have no idea how much.	M’għandux idea kemm.
After so long.	Wara tant żmien.
But that’s not what happens.	Imma dan mhux dak li jiġri.
I'm with him.	Jien miegħu.
He never wanted to talk about it.	Hu qatt ma ried jitkellem dwarha.
And now there isn’t.	U issa mhux hemm.
Good to know.	Tajjeb li tkun taf.
The problem is that school is not for me.	Il-problema hi li l-iskola mhix għalija.
There was always you alone.	Dejjem kien hemm int biss.
I have never seen so much before.	Qatt ma rajt daqshekk qabel.
She had work in the morning.	Kellha xogħol filgħodu.
Nothing can happen there.	Xejn ma jista' jiġri hemmhekk.
Okay, he could see that.	Tajjeb, dan seta’ jara.
It’s getting hard to tell.	Qed isir diffiċli li tgħid.
No one is taking it easy back there.	Ħadd mhu qed jieħu faċli lura hemmhekk.
I'm happy.	Jien kuntent.
He must be here.	Huwa għandu jkun hawn.
It's easier than you think.	Huwa aktar faċli milli taħseb.
But this was not a job.	Imma dan ma kienx xogħol.
The same thing happens there.	L-istess ħaġa jiġri hemmhekk.
Had ours been the only one.	Kieku tagħna kien l-uniku wieħed.
No, it won't.	Le, mhux se.
I have more.	Għandi aktar.
We will, we will.	Aħna se, irridu.
I need something better than that.	Għandi bżonn xi ħaġa aħjar minn hekk.
I want that a lot.	Irrid li ħafna.
I’m not going too bad.	Jien mhux sejjer ħażin wisq.
And so it does.	U hekk jagħmel.
Come on.	Ejja.
Not so fast, there.	Mhux daqshekk malajr, hemm.
It seems like so much work.	Jidher li tant xogħol.
It can't be.	Ma jistax ikun.
This is one way.	Dan huwa mod wieħed.
We knew what we had.	Konna nafu dak li kellna.
If you have money, it's great.	Jekk għandek flus, huwa kbir.
But it is still there.	Imma għadu hemm.
I hope she is right for you.	Nispera li hi tajba għalik.
I think it might help if you talk about it.	Naħseb li jista 'jgħin jekk titkellem dwarha.
Not as bad as you say.	Mhux daqshekk ħażin kif tgħid.
Someone had to do something.	Xi ħadd kellu jagħmel xi ħaġa.
They have things all the time.	Għandhom l-affarijiet il-ħin kollu.
But if you don’t.	Imma jekk ma tagħmilx hekk.
She knew exactly where she was.	Kienet taf eżatt fejn kienet.
And she never did.	U qatt ma għamlet.
But let me tell you why.	Imma ħa ngħidlek għaliex.
But how do you know when that will happen?	Imma kif tkun taf meta jiġri hekk?.
He never asked for it.	Huwa qatt ma talab għal dan.
I saw how it was possible.	Rajt kif jista’ jkun.
Come on out.	Ejja barra.
It's just good.	Huwa biss tajjeb.
You will do it.	Int se tagħmel dan.
There, better.	Hemmhekk, aħjar.
It's easy for me.	Huwa faċli għalija.
They are people.	Huma nies.
It just doesn’t look good.	Huwa biss ma jidher tajjeb.
It happens to me.	Jiġri lili.
He said that.	Huwa qal li.
He seemed scared.	Huwa deher jibża.
It's a lot.	Huwa ħafna.
He didn't tell me.	Hu ma qalli.
I say when.	Jien ngħid meta.
How bad can it be? 	Kemm jista’ jkun ħażin?
No one knew anything or anyone.	Ħadd ma kien jaf xejn jew ħadd.
I can do that, you see.	Dan nista’ nagħmel, tara.
She looked pretty beautiful.	Hija ħares pjuttost sabiħa.
I’m glad she’s back with me.	Jien ferħan li hija lura miegħi.
For one thing, she had no money.	Minn ħaġa waħda, hija ma kellha l-ebda flus.
Whatever it really is.	Tkun xi tkun verament.
He wanted everything.	Ried kollox.
Or it could be.	Jew jista 'jkun.
I will be back when you are.	Inkun lura meta tkun int.
I don’t want to go back.	Ma rridx immur lura.
She is very nice to me.	Hija sabiħa ħafna miegħi.
And we know this.	U dan nafu.
How can we do that.	Kif nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
You can't say no.	Ma tistax tgħid le.
This is a great one.	Din hija waħda kbira.
Come on, come on with me.	Ejja, ejja miegħi.
They are doing.	Qed jagħmlu.
Well, it wasn’t, not for me.	Ukoll, ma kienx, mhux għalija.
This is so difficult.	Dan huwa daqshekk diffiċli.
He did not want to leave.	Ma riedx jitlaq.
Something she knew she needed to do.	Xi ħaġa li kienet taf li kellha bżonn tagħmel.
Other times, not so much.	Drabi oħra, mhux daqshekk.
Not that it will always help.	Mhux li dejjem se jgħin.
This is what happened here.	Dan huwa dak li ġara hawn.
Let it be.	Ħa jkun .
Surely he knew this.	Żgur li kien jaf dan.
Maybe it's just too late.	Forsi huwa biss tard.
I’m not sure exactly.	M'inix ċert eżatt.
I actually love my job.	Fil-fatt inħobb ix-xogħol tiegħi.
Look one after the other.	Ħares wara xulxin.
Every job is difficult.	Kull xogħol huwa diffiċli.
This also goes well.	Dan ukoll imur tajjeb.
We are together out of here.	Aħna flimkien barra minn hawn.
It seems they are.	Jidher li huma.
Not good, but better.	Mhux tajjeb, imma aħjar.
And that he didn’t want to.	U li ma riedx.
But he did.	Imma hekk għamel.
They are all so little.	Dawn huma kollha daqshekk ftit.
But I can't understand how.	Imma ma nistax nifhem kif.
She wasn’t many people.	Hija ma kinitx ħafna nies.
He is here to speak the truth.	Qiegħed hawn biex titkellem il-verità.
He may not know.	Jista’ ma jkunx jaf.
In fact, it’s easy.	Fil-fatt, huwa faċli.
There was just no one else.	Ma kien hemm biss ħadd ieħor.
When it’s good, it’s really good.	Meta jkun tajjeb, huwa tassew tajjeb.
Until now.	Sa issa.
No one needs to be surprised.	Ħadd ma jeħtieġ li jkun sorpriż.
They have, like, nothing.	Huma għandhom, bħal, xejn.
But actually, pretty good.	Imma fil-fatt, pjuttost tajjeb.
She had to think about it.	Kellha taħseb dwarha.
Not sure what's going on.	Mhux ċert x'qed jiġri.
He had tried that more than once.	Huwa kien ipprova li aktar minn darba.
It was over at that time.	Kien fuq dak iż-żmien.
That works very well.	Li jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
If not, that would be fine as well.	Jekk le, dan ikun tajjeb ukoll.
We know no one or nothing.	Ma nafu lil ħadd jew xejn.
But it is still early.	Imma għadu kmieni.
Something she just could see.	Xi ħaġa hi biss tista' tara.
I never go there.	Jien qatt ma mmur hemm.
Yours is great.	Tiegħek huwa kbir.
He didn't look at me once.	Huwa ma ħares lejn tiegħi darba.
This is what they do.	Dan huwa dak li jagħmlu dan.
In the morning, she is supposed to.	Filgħodu, hija suppost.
For some people, it is.	Għal xi nies, huwa.
That was yesterday morning.	Dan kien ilbieraħ filgħodu.
So far it was all work.	Sa issa kien kollu xogħol.
And you’re not doing that.	U int mhux qed tagħmel hekk.
Like, really really.	Bħal, tassew tassew.
Why go there, why everyone goes there.	Għaliex tmur hemm, għaliex kulħadd imur hemm.
He entered the room.	Huwa daħal fil-kamra.
I didn’t have time to say anything.	Ma kelli ħin ngħid xejn.
And there are other things we can do.	U hemm affarijiet oħra li nistgħu nagħmlu.
After all it can happen.	Wara kollox jista 'jiġri.
It would be tonight, or nothing.	Ikun illejla, jew xejn.
You’re worried about it.	Int inkwetat dwarha.
We cannot do that.	Ma nistgħux nagħmlu dan.
We know for whom it works.	Nafu għal min qed jaħdem.
That was a long time ago, actually.	Ilu li kien ilu, fil-fatt.
After all, there may be enough.	Wara kollox, jista 'jkun hemm biżżejjed.
One had died.	Wieħed kien miet.
It probably won’t be the last.	Probabbilment mhux se jkun l-aħħar.
He couldn't see anymore.	Ma setax jara aktar.
I don’t know where.	Ma nafx fejn.
You who did it.	Int li għamilt dan.
That was not what I was planning to do today.	Dan ma kienx dak li kont qed tippjana li tagħmel illum.
So it always is.	Hekk hu dejjem.
He wants to be with you.	Irid ikun miegħek.
This is more difficult.	Dan huwa aktar diffiċli.
It can be helpful.	Jista 'jkun ta' għajnuna.
He was actually right.	Fil-fatt kellu raġun.
He wanted to live so long.	Ried jgħix daqshekk twil.
I want to love.	Irrid inħobb.
I couldn’t do it anymore.	Ma stajtx nagħmel aktar.
I need more.	Għandi bżonn aktar.
He would never do these things.	Hu qatt ma kien jagħmel dawn l-affarijiet.
There will always be.	Dejjem ikun hemm.
I will try that now.	Se mmur nipprova dak issa.
Sorry if he is your friend.	Jiddispjaċini jekk hu ħabib tiegħek.
And everyone has a good time.	U kulħadd għandu ħin tajjeb.
I saw yours.	Rajt tiegħek.
You can’t do one or the other.	Ma tistax tagħmel waħda jew oħra.
But that wasn’t a big deal.	Imma dan ma kienx xi ħaġa kbira.
He lost his job.	Huwa tilef ix-xogħol tiegħu.
This happens almost every morning.	Dan jiġri kważi kull filgħodu.
He didn’t have to work tomorrow.	Ma kellux għalfejn jaħdem għada.
I never told this to anyone.	Qatt ma għidt dan lil ħadd.
I couldn't even think.	Lanqas stajt naħseb.
No more.	Mhux aktar.
But there was no time to think.	Imma ma kienx hemm ħin biex taħseb.
I have it all.	Għandi dak kollu.
He was helping someone.	Kien jgħin lil xi ħadd.
Very bad, actually.	Ħażin ħafna, fil-fatt.
I didn’t think it would.	Ma kontx naħseb li kieku.
Anyone want to try that ?.	Xi ħadd irid jipprova dak?.
Not once.	Mhux darba waħda.
He sees the following.	Huwa jara dak li ġej.
And now this did not seem so difficult.	U issa dan ma deherx daqshekk diffiċli.
Good for you for that.	Tajjeb għalik għal dak.
Or not, usually.	Jew le, normalment.
I see.	Jiena nara.
I see a lot.	Nara ħafna.
I can't say anything now.	Ma nistax ngħid xejn issa.
What he had he did not want.	Dak li kellu ma riedx.
It doesn’t have to be good.	Ma jridx ikun tajjeb.
But it was small too.	Imma kien żgħir ukoll.
It can’t be that good.	Ma jistax ikun daqshekk tajjeb.
There is only one or the other.	Hemm wieħed jew ieħor biss.
I know it’s not working.	Naf li mhux qed jaħdem.
This was harder than he thought it would be.	Dan kien aktar diffiċli milli kien ħaseb li se jkun.
It works well now.	Jaħdem tajjeb issa.
What you had to say.	Dak li kellek xi tgħid.
But that’s not what he wants.	Imma dan mhux dak li jrid.
Maybe not what you think it is.	Forsi mhux dak li taħseb li hu.
He is with someone else.	Huwa ma 'xi ħadd ieħor.
I was definitely surprised.	Żgur kont sorpriż.
Currently both are just sitting there.	Bħalissa t-tnejn huma biss bilqiegħda hemm.
Probably more than me.	Probabbilment aktar minni.
She was going to do it all.	Kienet se tagħmel dan kollu.
But here's the problem.	Imma hawn il-problema.
You already have a job.	Diġà għandek xogħol.
We don’t, we don’t, but we will.	M'għandniex, m'għandniex, imma se nagħmlu.
No one knew anything.	Ħadd ma kien jaf xejn.
I don’t know if you can tell.	Ma nafx jekk tistax tgħid.
And they were just the first.	U kienu biss l-ewwel.
He is obviously the same person.	Huwa ovvjament l-istess persuna.
It was like being back home.	Kien qisu lura d-dar.
You don’t have to be doing what you’re doing.	M'għandekx tkun qed tagħmel dak li qed tagħmel.
This is more than we had.	Dan huwa aktar milli kellna.
We never did.	Aħna qatt ma.
He could live again.	Seta’ jgħix mill-ġdid.
Great and of course.	Kbir u ovvjament.
As it happened.	Kif ġara.
But there you go.	Imma hemm tmur.
When no one else was.	Meta ħadd ieħor ma kien.
This does not have to be the case.	Dan m'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
He was also a great friend.	Kien ukoll ħabib kbir.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ma setax jieħu aktar.
Help each other.	Għajnuna lil xulxin.
I couldn’t think of that.	Ma stajtx naħseb hekk.
I didn’t, I can’t, I do it.	Ma kontx, ma nistax, nagħmel dan.
No one else wants to know.	Ħadd ieħor ma jrid ikun jaf.
You already have everything there.	Inti diġà għandek kollox hemmhekk.
So far, this has taken a while to do.	Sa issa, dan ħa xi ftit tagħmel.
Now we know.	Issa nafu.
I'm going there now.	Jien issa sejjer hemm.
But he knew, he knew.	Imma kien jaf, kien jaf.
You can be who you want to be.	Tista’ tkun min trid tkun.
And there must be.	U għandu jkun hemm.
I had no idea this could happen.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea li dan jista' jiġri.
And it seems likely that it will.	U jidher probabbli li se.
Or it seems, from the outside.	Jew jidher li, minn barra.
To do this again.	Biex tagħmel dan għal darba oħra mill-ġdid.
She knew everything she was thinking.	Kienet taf dak kollu li kienet qed taħseb.
There won’t be much more like this.	Mhux se jkun hemm ħafna aktar bħal dan.
He always told me everything.	Dejjem qalli kollox.
I did this some time back.	Dan għamilt xi żmien lura.
That's wrong.	Dak hu ħażin.
It never happens.	Qatt ma jiġri.
Definitely see this.	Żgur li tara dan.
And it can be.	U jista’ jkun.
He has no job.	M’għandux xogħol.
You are a person.	Inti persuna.
I just do my job.	Jien nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħi biss.
I think this is a great idea.	Naħseb li din hija idea kbira.
But either way is right with me.	Imma kull mod huwa tajjeb miegħi.
He did so for us.	Huwa għamel hekk għalina.
But this is not a good time.	Imma dan mhux żmien tajjeb.
Like every other year.	Bħal kull sena oħra.
She was a boy who doesn’t want to be alone.	Kienet tifel li ma jridx ikun waħdu.
There must be time.	Għandu jkun hemm ħin.
He went too far.	Huwa mar wisq.
Anything you like.	Xi ħaġa li tixtieq.
It doesn’t make friends.	Ma jagħmilx ħbieb.
Maybe just so.	Forsi biss hekk.
And you never will.	U int qatt ma se.
Most people, actually.	Ħafna nies, fil-fatt.
If you are ready.	Jekk inti lest.
Maybe he doesn’t think so.	Forsi ma jaħsibx hekk.
At that time you almost had it.	Dak iż-żmien kważi kellek.
No one, no one outside.	Ħadd ma, ħadd barra.
But there was something else out there as well.	Imma kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra hemmhekk ukoll.
She was going to do this job.	Hija kienet se tagħmel dan ix-xogħol.
She was supposed to be well, it had to be.	Hija suppost li kien ukoll, kellu jkun.
We had nothing.	Ma kellna xejn.
It's just like now.	Huwa eżatt bħal issa.
But he was waiting for me.	Imma kien jistenna għalija.
I know what he's thinking.	Naf x’qed jaħseb.
For me, too much work.	Għalija, wisq xogħol.
Better I don’t know.	Aħjar ma nafx.
I thought I was alone.	Ħsibt li ġejt waħdek.
We can't do anything.	Aħna ma nistgħux nagħmlu xejn.
Really, it should.	Verament, għandu.
It may have been what he did last night.	Seta’ kien dak li għamel ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
I was a little out a while ago.	Kont ftit barra ftit ilu.
It wasn’t too good.	Ma kienx wisq tajjeb.
I really wasn’t.	Verament ma kontx.
But it’s not working yet.	Imma għadu mhux qed jaħdem.
So he knows.	Hekk jaf.
It was above all.	Kienet fuq kollox.
But no one else is doing it.	Imma ħadd ieħor mhu qed jagħmel dan.
I can talk about this for a long time.	Nista’ nitkellem dwar dan għal żmien twil.
All good enough.	Kollox tajjeb biżżejjed.
I’m worried about it.	Jien inkwetat dwarha.
She knew she didn't.	Kienet taf li m’għandux.
He was going to survive.	Kien se jgħix.
We can be who we want to be.	Nistgħu nkunu min irridu.
She has done this before.	Hija għamlet dan qabel.
You want to know something.	Trid tkun taf xi ħaġa.
He was one year old.	Kellu sena.
He knew he had something with him.	Kien jaf li kellu xi ħaġa miegħu.
I shouldn’t be happy.	M'għandix inkun kuntent.
It was so bad.	Kien daqshekk ħażin.
Or maybe it’s just arrived.	Jew forsi għadu kif wasal.
I think we do both.	Naħseb li nagħmlu t-tnejn.
We are with you !.	Aħna miegħek!.
I don’t know if I speak or not.	Ma nafx nitkellem jew le.
It’s not happening.	Mhux qed jiġri.
If he could do that, he could do something.	Jekk seta’ jagħmel dan, jista’ jagħmel xi ħaġa.
I wanted to think but not much.	Ridt naħseb imma mhux ħafna.
Well, maybe a little.	Ukoll, forsi ftit.
But he also knew she needed this.	Imma kien jaf ukoll li kellha bżonn dan.
I just know he is.	Naf biss li hu.
And maybe he had.	U forsi kellu.
I can't understand why.	Jien ma nistax nifhem għaliex.
You will not be going back to that house.	Inti mhux se tkun qed tmur lura lejn dik id-dar.
It didn't take long.	Ma kienx ħa twil.
It’s something else you want to know.	Hija xi ħaġa oħra li trid tkun taf.
There is one above.	Hemm xi wieħed hawn fuq.
I will not be back.	Jien mhux se nkun lura.
They do a good job.	Jagħmlu xogħol tajjeb.
You must have done well.	Int trid tkun għamilt tajjeb.
It was just still.	Kien għadu biss.
This was not.	Dan ma kienx.
And you can never, ever tell anyone that.	U int qatt, qatt ma tista’ tgħid lil ħadd hekk.
He didn’t know, he wasn’t sure.	Ma kienx jaf, ma kienx ċert.
We had these.	Kellna dawn.
You are doing much better.	Int sejjer ħafna aħjar.
Well, I did.	Ukoll, għamilt dan.
Nor do we.	Lanqas għandna.
You have to be able to do whatever you want.	Għandek tkun kapaċi tagħmel dak kollu li trid.
It is, and will be, forever.	Huwa, u se jkun, għal dejjem.
Nothing more will happen to him.	Mhu se jiġri xejn aktar miegħu.
Or maybe you don’t.	Jew forsi ma tagħmilx hekk.
I'm so back.	Jien tant lura.
He did this over and over.	Huwa għamel dan aktar u aktar.
You should maybe eat something.	Għandek forsi tiekol xi ħaġa.
Just a few hours.	Ftit sigħat biss.
This will do the same.	Dan se jagħmel l-istess.
He’s just a big boy, really.	Huwa biss tifel kbir, tassew.
You just know what that is.	Int biss tkun taf x'inhu dak.
Nothing happens.	M'hemm xejn jiġri.
Making things happen.	Nagħmlu l-affarijiet jiġri.
It is what we need.	Hi dik li għandna bżonn.
I just sat down.	I biss poġġa bilqiegħda.
I would be happy to hear about it.	Inkun kuntent nisma' dwarha.
Few people are.	Ftit nies huma.
I’m not sure what all that is.	M'inix ċert x'inhu dak kollu.
He is not waiting.	Ma jkunx qed jistenna.
I don’t want to talk.	Ma rridx nitkellem.
He was never a man.	Qatt ma kien raġel.
And she will do it.	U hi se tagħmel dan.
But that’s not what it was.	Imma dan mhux dak li kien.
No one does the same.	Ħadd ma jagħmel l-istess.
Too late to return.	Tard wisq biex lura.
I just didn’t do anything.	Biss ma għamilt xejn.
He stays there.	Hu joqgħod hemm.
But just to see.	Imma biss biex tara.
But it all happened afterwards.	Imma dak kollu ġara wara.
Not for me you are not.	Mhux għalija m'intix.
But this doesn’t really work.	Imma dan ma tantx jaħdem.
I want them to do well.	Irrid li jagħmlu tajjeb.
I didn’t go to school.	Jien ma mort l-iskola.
It was here that it all began.	Kien hawn li kollox beda.
They were always there.	Dejjem kienu hemm.
I had to do everything on my own.	Kelli nagħmel kollox waħdi.
I really talk to him.	Tassew nitkellem miegħu.
I just sit down.	Jien biss noqgħod bilqiegħda.
He never said much of anything.	Qatt ma qal ħafna minn xejn.
It has not always been so.	Mhux dejjem kien hekk.
Nothing, nothing.	Xejn, xejn.
This actually happened to me.	Dan fil-fatt ġara lili.
No, this never happens.	Le, dan qatt ma jiġri.
Or maybe it wasn’t.	Jew forsi ma kienx.
Best of all.	Aħjar minn kulħadd.
I hope it helps.	Nittama li jgħin.
You can go home now.	Tista’ tmur id-dar issa.
He was all alone.	Kien kollu waħdu.
And here's another one.	U hawn ieħor.
And when you do, it’s too late.	U meta tagħmel dan, ikun tard wisq.
But she didn't know who to go with.	Imma hawn ma kienet taf lil ħadd ma’ min imur.
But you see nothing.	Imma ma tara xejn.
Everyone wants to stay together.	Kulħadd irid joqgħod flimkien.
That ago.	Dak ilu.
What he was saying.	Dak li kien jgħid.
I want you to do this.	Irrid li tagħmel dan.
Maybe he wanted to.	Forsi ried.
A little of that, a little of that.	Ftit minn dan, ftit minn dak.
It was really something.	Kienet tassew xi ħaġa.
If it goes wrong.	Jekk tmur ħażin.
I’ll say more about that in a moment.	Jien ser ngħid aktar dwar dan fi ftit.
After he died.	Wara li miet.
Or maybe as a whole.	Jew forsi kollu kemm hu.
She did so often.	Hija għamlet hekk spiss.
Here and now.	Hawn u issa.
He had a lot of money.	Kellu ħafna flus.
Before he died.	Qabel ma miet.
Looks like you're not here.	Qisu m’intix hawn.
He obviously did nothing wrong.	Huwa ovvjament ma għamel xejn ħażin.
Here it comes.	Hawn ġej.
Think before you speak.	Jaħseb qabel ma jitkellem.
He can never do that here.	Dan hu qatt ma jista’ jagħmel hawn.
No one was there.	Ħadd ma kien hemm.
He died.	Huwa miet.
No one seemed to be.	Ħadd ma deher li kien.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
Probably a bit pretty good.	Probabbilment daqsxejn pjuttost tajjeb.
Maybe it happened to me.	Forsi ġara lili.
It may or may not be.	Jista 'jkun jew ma jistax ikun.
That should be really enough.	Dan għandu jkun verament biżżejjed.
But it didn’t have to be done.	Imma ma kellux isir.
I couldn’t buy one now.	Ma stajtx nixtri waħda issa.
From above.	Minn fuq.
You can either do it or you can’t.	Tista' jew tagħmel dan jew ma tistax.
But there was always too much of me.	Imma dejjem kien hemm wisq minni.
I'm good either way.	Jien tajjeb jew mod.
He hadn't had one in a long time.	Kien ilu ma kellux waħda.
It can take a very long time.	Jista 'jieħu żmien twil ħafna.
He left and left.	Telaq u telaq.
No more, of course.	Mhux aktar, ovvjament.
She was doing something about it.	Kienet tagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
He said he would.	Qal li kieku.
What we will do.	Dak li se nagħmlu.
I don’t want to talk to you.	Ma rridx nitkellem miegħek.
Maybe he couldn't say anything.	Forsi ma seta’ jgħid xejn.
No to that.	Le għal dak.
Maybe more.	Forsi aktar.
He did it alone.	Huwa għamel dan waħdu.
Say everything you want before you eat.	Għid dak kollu li trid qabel tiekol.
He prayed for you, boy.	Huwa talab għalik, tifel.
When you want.	Meta trid.
You can't do everything but you can do something.	Ma tistax tagħmel kollox imma tista’ tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I had none.	Ma kelli l-ebda.
That was for him.	Dak kien għalih.
We are the same people.	Aħna l-istess nies.
But then.	Imma dak iż-żmien.
I ask only one thing.	Nistaqsi ħaġa waħda biss.
No one else does.	Ħadd ieħor ma jagħmel.
And it never does.	U dan qatt ma jagħmel.
Everything happened quickly.	Kollox ġara malajr.
For me, that wasn’t much.	Għalija, dan ma kienx ħafna.
Nothing else happened.	Ma ġara xejn barra minn hekk.
I could see he wasn’t very happy.	Stajt nara li ma kienx kuntent ħafna.
I never knew.	Qatt ma kont naf.
Good to talk about these things.	Tajjeb li titkellem dwar dawn l-affarijiet.
I will be back soon.	Dalwaqt ser inkun lura.
I want to see it all.	Irrid nara dan kollu.
I wish they were.	Nixtieq li kienu.
No one thought it would ever happen, but it did.	Ħadd ma ħaseb li qatt se jiġri, imma hekk ġara.
Surely she knew that.	Żgur li kienet taf li.
For then and for now only.	Għal dak iż-żmien u għal issa biss.
They were friends.	Kienu ħbieb.
That seems like a good thing.	Dan jidher li huwa tajjeb.
I can’t have any, you know.	Ma nistax ikolli l-ebda, taf.
This was not.	Dan ma kienx.
It certainly wasn’t.	Huwa żgur li ma kienx.
Not a bad thing to do.	Mhux xi ħaġa ħażina li tagħmel.
No one even tries.	Ħadd lanqas jipprova.
And it wasn’t much.	U ma kienx ħafna.
He’s just a friend.	Huwa biss ħabib.
Last time was better.	L-aħħar darba kienet aħjar.
This can be seen as follows.	Dan jista 'jidher kif ġej.
You do well, well.	Inti tagħmel tajjeb, tajjeb.
It wouldn’t be here enough.	Ma kienx ikun hawn biżżejjed.
Not once more.	Mhux darba aktar.
And that would be great.	U dan ikun kbir.
It must be enough.	Irid ikun biżżejjed.
That time was coming soon.	Dak iż-żmien kien ġej dalwaqt.
If he did it once, he could do it again.	Jekk għamel dan darba, jista’ jerġa’ jagħmel.
I’m trying to understand exactly who.	Qed nipprova nifhem eżatt min.
Try to do this almost never.	Ipprova tagħmel dan kważi qatt.
I don’t even have to think about it.	Lanqas għandi għalfejn naħseb dwarha.
At that time he did so.	Dak iż-żmien hekk għamel.
Everyone eats afterwards.	Kulħadd jiekol wara.
He says he is busy.	Jgħid li hu okkupat.
Just so, he asked for more money.	Eżatt hekk, talab aktar flus.
In addition, your work is not finished.	Barra minn hekk, ix-xogħol tiegħek mhux lest.
This is now ready.	Dan issa lest.
We never had any problems.	Qatt ma kellna xi problemi.
I couldn’t think of anything to say.	Ma stajt naħseb xejn xi ngħid.
It felt good too.	Ħassu tajjeb ukoll.
I never thought it would be so difficult.	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jkun daqshekk diffiċli.
It looks like a lot of fun.	Jidher qisu ħafna gost.
I could be with.	I jista 'jkun bi.
She says she will.	Tgħid li se.
I wonder what’s wrong.	Nistaqsi x'hemm ħażin.
They are there.	Huma hemmhekk.
Let me say this about it.	Ħa ngħid dan dwar dan.
This car looks too much.	Din il-karozza tidher wisq.
I think about these often.	Naħseb dwar dawn spiss.
This happened quickly.	Dan ġara malajr.
Definitely not the last.	Żgur mhux l-aħħar.
One does another.	Wieħed jagħmel ieħor.
Also, this will be the last time we will be together.	Barra minn hekk, din tkun l-aħħar darba li nkunu flimkien.
Maybe that would be enough.	Forsi dan ikun biżżejjed.
I can't.	Jien ma nistax.
It’s still the same.	Għadu l-istess.
I needed his help.	Jien kelli bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħu.
Good to know why.	Tajjeb li tkun taf għaliex.
The work was done very well.	Ix-xogħol sar tajjeb ħafna.
As long as we want to be.	Sakemm irridu nkunu.
But there is the problem.	Imma hemm hemm il-problema.
It will do.	Se tagħmel.
Always, completely.	Dejjem, għal kollox.
Not coming here.	Mhux ġej hawn.
I’m still not sure it’s good.	Għadni mhux ċert li hu tajjeb.
That was good to me.	Dan kien tajjeb miegħi.
One child died.	Tifel wieħed miet.
She wants to be with me.	Hija trid tkun miegħi.
Very great indeed.	Kbir ħafna tassew.
She hasn’t even thought about it since it happened.	Hija lanqas biss ħsibt dwar dan minn meta ġara.
Sar so much.	Sar tant.
I was really surprised like.	Kont verament sorpriż bħal.
That’s all, really.	Dan huwa kollox, tassew.
It seems I can’t do that.	Jidher li ma nistax nagħmel hekk.
But no one ever did.	Imma ħadd qatt ma għamel.
This will not work for us.	Dan mhux se jaħdem għalina.
That’s me again.	Dak jien mill-ġdid.
She knew he was going to do something.	Kienet taf li kien se jagħmel xi ħaġa.
And there it was.	U hemm kien.
They were right there.	Kienu hemm eżatt.
Nothing was coming for him.	Xejn ma kien ġej għalih.
Not all of me, of course.	Mhux kollu tiegħi, ovvjament.
No one is sure.	Ħadd mhu ċert.
Now you’re really scared.	Issa int verament jibża.
You can't see anything.	Ma tistax tara xi ħaġa.
But I’m not sure how to do that.	Imma m'inix ċert kif tagħmel dan.
Anyone can do anything.	Kulħadd jista’ jagħmel xi ħaġa.
I hope all is well with you.	Nittama li kollox tajjeb miegħek.
Pretty tall man.	Raġel pjuttost twil.
It would be so hard to go back now.	Ikun daqshekk diffiċli li tmur lura issa.
They do, really.	Jagħmlu, tassew.
It's time.	Wasal iż-żmien.
Nothing will ever be the same again.	Xejn qatt mhu se jerġa’ jkun l-istess.
Nor did he see.	Lanqas ma ra.
He took no money.	Ma ħa l-ebda flus.
It’s so hard to know for sure.	Huwa daqshekk diffiċli li tkun taf żgur.
I heard about it.	Smajt dwarha.
There are with.	Hemm bi .
I think he was back and forth.	Naħseb li kien lura u lura.
The truth often does.	Il-verità spiss tagħmel.
I’m scared of everything.	Jien nibża minn kollox.
In fact, nothing else works.	Fil-fatt, xejn aktar ma jaħdem.
Maybe you are too.	Forsi int ukoll.
In fact, it probably was.	Fil-fatt, x'aktarx kien.
That was too early.	Dan kien kmieni wisq.
But it's really easy.	Imma huwa verament faċli.
I knew everyone.	Kont naf lil kulħadd.
Maybe it would be the same thing now.	Forsi tkun l-istess ħaġa issa.
It’s just not so good of a man.	Huwa biss mhux daqshekk tajjeb ta 'raġel.
I wonder what he is thinking.	Nistaqsi x’qed jaħseb.
Who doesn't have the time.	Min m’għandux il-ħin.
In fact often not.	Fil-fatt ħafna drabi mhux.
I often think about it.	Ħafna drabi naħseb dwarha.
I’m a busy man.	Jien raġel okkupat.
I would say the same.	Jien ngħid l-istess.
When she was home and after.	Meta kienet id-dar u wara.
But surely he is.	Imma żgur hu.
It was going well on its own.	Kien sejjer tajjeb waħdu.
Only these two.	Biss dawn it-tnejn.
But you see nothing.	Imma ma tara xejn.
But it looked like nothing.	Imma kien qisu xejn.
Everything had happened too fast.	Kollox kien ġara malajr wisq.
Maybe it would be better in the morning.	Forsi jkun aħjar filgħodu.
He can't have you.	Huwa ma jistax ikollu inti.
I think it was for noon.	Naħseb li kien għal nofsinhar.
Everyone will be so interested.	Kulħadd se jkun hekk interessat.
To tell you the truth, it’s not a bad idea.	Biex ngħidlek il-verità, mhix idea ħażina.
It didn’t seem to be.	Ma deherx li kien.
By afternoon it would have been fine.	Sa wara nofsinhar kien ikun tajjeb.
This took about three years.	Dan ħa madwar tliet snin.
It comes when it comes.	Jiġi meta jiġi.
I wasn’t there.	Jien ma kontx hemm.
Now she knew better.	Issa kienet taf aħjar.
That and that you must be a man.	Dak u li trid tkun raġel.
About almost everything.	Dwar kważi kollox.
I couldn't hear anything.	Ma stajt nisma’ xejn.
She wants us to go there tonight.	Hi trid li mmorru hemm illejla.
He is scared.	Huwa jibża’.
I can't be with you.	Ma nistax inkun miegħek.
It had been there for years.	Kien ilu hemm għal snin.
I wish it wasn’t.	Nixtieq li ma kienx.
I'm not surprised.	M'iniex sorpriż.
Better be.	Aħjar tkun.
It was unoccupied.	Kien mhux okkupat.
I wonder what it was like when I was little.	Nistaqsi kif kien meta kien żgħir.
I’m having fun after all.	Qed nieħu gost wara kollox.
But they will do it.	Imma se jagħmlu dan.
It may be a little.	Jista 'jkun ftit.
He really did.	Huwa tassew għamel.
I couldn’t believe it.	Ma stajtx nemmen.
But that doesn’t have to be the case.	Imma dan m'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
I needed a little help.	Kelli bżonn ftit għajnuna.
He really did.	Huwa tassew għamel.
Everything was pretty easy to do.	Kollox kien pjuttost faċli li tagħmel.
That's a boy.	Dak hu tifel.
This is where it will be.	Dan huwa fejn se jkun.
It was as good as ever.	Kien tajjeb daqs qatt qabel.
He really knows his stuff !.	Huwa verament jaf l-affarijiet tiegħu!.
Not so much.	Mhux daqshekk.
It happens to a lot of people.	Jiġri lil ħafna nies.
I want to talk to you about this.	Irrid nitkellem miegħek dwar dan.
Some things are easy.	Xi affarijiet huma faċli.
It looks good.	Jidher tajjeb.
That will not stay the same.	Dak mhux se jibqa l-istess.
I love it that way.	Jien inħobb hekk.
I don’t want to say much.	Ma rridx ngħid ħafna.
But we needed more than that.	Imma kellna bżonn aktar minn hekk.
They are all we have ever had.	Huma kollha li qatt kellna.
Everyone looks so good.	Kulħadd jidher daqshekk tajjeb.
But you have a lot more.	Imma għandek ħafna aktar.
He knew tonight.	Kien jaf illejla.
But if he wants to, fine.	Imma jekk irid, tajjeb.
that will do.	li se tagħmel.
Someday, but not now.	Xi darba, imma mhux issa.
It's one by one.	Huwa wieħed wieħed.
This really helps.	Dan tassew jgħin.
It's all of them.	Huwa kollha kemm huma.
It was tomorrow.	Kienet għada.
I want a lot more.	Irrid ħafna aktar.
It's bad.	Huwa ħażin.
He wanted to go back, actually.	Ried imur lura, fil-fatt.
Not just in the morning.	Mhux filgħodu biss.
Anyone can do it.	Kulħadd jista 'jagħmel dan.
There was just one other thing to do.	Kien hemm biss ħaġa oħra xi tagħmel.
He doesn’t seem able to sit up.	Ma jidhirx kapaċi toqgħod bilqiegħda.
But not before.	Imma mhux qabel.
He wanted nothing.	Ma ried xejn.
It wasn’t a big deal.	Ma kienx xi ħaġa kbira.
And not just a chance.	U mhux biss ċans.
And everything will be better.	U kollox se jkun aħjar.
No, he was not able to.	Le, ma kienx kapaċi.
I'm really scared for you.	Jien tassew nibża' għalik.
I know why you came here.	Naf għaliex ġejt hawn.
I didn’t know.	Ma kontx taf.
But this book can help.	Imma dan il-ktieb jista’ jgħin.
They were too.	Kienu wisq.
Or do something.	Jew tagħmel xi ħaġa.
This has happened once before.	Dan ġara darba qabel.
I was happy !.	Kont kuntent!.
Now we know why.	Issa nafu għaliex.
He was very good to me.	Kien tajjeb ħafna miegħi.
Do the work.	Tagħmel ix-xogħol.
I’m still talking.	Għadni qed nitkellem.
This may not be the case.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx.
One big, one small.	Wieħed kbir, wieħed żgħir.
That's what he wanted.	Hekk ried hu.
It was a chance to take.	Kien ċans ta’ min jieħu dak iż-żmien.
Maybe she should.	Forsi kellha.
I have to go.	Ikolli mmur.
Only it always gets better.	Biss jibqa' dejjem aħjar.
It was too big.	Kienet kbir wisq.
As well.	Kif ukoll .
I'm coming.	Jien ġej.
I thought he did a good job.	Ħsibt li għamel xogħol tajjeb.
A great idea is a great idea.	Idea kbira hija idea kbira.
I think we go home now.	Naħseb li mmorru d-dar issa.
But he wasn’t going to think about it now.	Imma ma kienx se jaħseb dwar dan issa.
But he comes.	Imma hu ġej.
Unable to do so, he went back to his house.	Ma setax jagħmel dan, huwa mar lura d-dar tiegħu.
You are more than that.	Inti aktar minn dak.
If not, return something else.	Jekk le, lura xi ħaġa oħra.
And there isn’t one.	U ma jkunx hemm waħda.
Now, nothing works.	Issa, xejn ma jaħdem.
You just need a little not a lot.	Għandek bżonn biss ftit mhux ħafna.
He is right that.	Huwa għandu raġun li.
This is still good.	Dan għadu tajjeb.
Nothing ever does.	Xejn qatt ma jagħmel.
Now I say very little about it.	Issa ftit li xejn ngħid dwarha.
He's worried about it.	Huwa inkwetat dwarha.
It started to have a lot of fun.	Beda jieħu gost ħafna.
It would be good for me.	Ikun tajjeb għalija.
I hope that will be enough.	Nittama li jkun biżżejjed.
Or maybe that was just him.	Jew forsi dak kien biss hu.
Everything is so still.	Kollox hekk għadu.
And there you are.	U int hemm.
Or so he had thought.	Jew hekk kien ħaseb.
And it’s really easy to do.	U huwa verament faċli li tagħmel.
Everyone out.	Kulħadd barra.
Not sure how.	Għadu mhux ċert kif.
But if he wanted to.	Imma kieku ried.
And that was it.	U dak iż-żmien kien.
But that’s not what it says.	Imma dan mhux dak li jgħid.
She says it’s not something.	Hi tgħid li mhix xi ħaġa.
Now we do.	Issa nagħmlu.
I was always worried about everything.	Dejjem kont inkwetat dwar kollox.
So it will always be.	Hekk se jkun dejjem.
He did not know what to say next.	Ma kienx jaf x’se jgħid wara.
There is something for everyone.	Hemm xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
Nobody asked who they were.	Ħadd ma staqsa ma’ min kienu.
It always comes.	Dejjem jiġi.
This could not be done.	Dan ma setax isir.
I was tired of that.	I kien għajjien ta 'dak.
It couldn’t really be happening.	Ma setax verament qed jiġri.
No one did anything.	Ħadd ma għamel xejn.
I don't think so.	ma naħsibx.
He will be back tonight.	Huwa se jkun lura illejla.
The work was done.	Ix-xogħol sar.
I can’t just talk to anyone.	Ma nistax nitkellem ma' xi ħadd biss.
When this was happening.	Meta dan kien qed jiġri.
Just me and you.	Jien u int biss.
I think it’s better than that.	Naħseb li hu aħjar minn hekk.
It's been a long time.	Ilu ħafna.
It's getting late.	Qed isir tard.
But there is more, much more.	Imma hemm aktar, ħafna aktar.
You can’t make everyone happy.	Ma tistax tagħmel lil kulħadd kuntent.
I’m the only one here.	Jien l-uniku wieħed hawn.
This could be a lot easier, he said.	Dan jista 'jkun ħafna aktar faċli, huwa qal.
It should.	Għandu .
He didn’t have time for that.	Ma kellux ħin għal dan.
I hope to be back soon.	Nittama li tkun lura dalwaqt.
Very bad for you.	Ħażin ħafna għalik.
Not a big deal.	Mhix xi ħaġa kbira.
Everyone has.	Kulħadd għandu.
Yesterday and today and tomorrow.	Ilbieraħ u llum u għada.
The book he was waiting for.	Il-ktieb li kien qed jistenna.
Everyone wanted to do something.	Kulħadd ried jagħmel xi ħaġa.
I still know where he is.	Għadni naf fejn hu.
That’s not everyone.	Dak mhux kulħadd.
Good on your time.	Tajjeb il-ħin tiegħek.
She'll know by no later than tomorrow morning.	Hija tkun taf sa mhux aktar tard minn għada filgħodu.
The timing is not always the same.	Il-ħin mhux dejjem l-istess.
And many such things you do.	U ħafna affarijiet bħal dawn inti tagħmel.
No one can see anything.	Ħadd ma jista’ jara xejn.
I’m not supposed to know all this.	Jien mhux suppost naf dan kollu.
This along with trying.	Dan flimkien ma jipprova .
Too little, too late.	Ftit wisq, tard wisq.
If he is a child.	Jekk huwa tifel.
It could be something else.	Jista 'jkun xi ħaġa oħra.
Everyone wants to be with you actually.	Kulħadd irid ikun miegħek fil-fatt.
But there it was.	Imma hemm kienet.
I was afraid of what you might do.	Kont nibża’ minn dak li tista’ tagħmel.
Easy to talk to.	Faċli biex titkellem.
He had thought about how she looked.	Huwa kien ħaseb dwar kif kienet tidher.
I think it turned out really well.	Naħseb li ħareġ tassew tajjeb.
That wasn’t enough for me.	Dan ma kienx biżżejjed għalija.
Well, you want to know what all this is about.	Ukoll, trid tkun taf x'inhu dan kollu.
The work was mine.	Ix-xogħol kien tiegħi.
You weren’t talking.	Int ma kontx titkellem.
But he obviously didn’t.	Imma ovvjament ma kellux.
That’s a lot of what it is.	Dak hu ħafna minn dak li hu.
I want to wait and hope.	Irrid nistenna u nittama.
They were just like that.	Hekk kienu biss.
Not so hard.	Mhux daqshekk diffiċli.
These things were very difficult.	Dawn l-affarijiet kienu diffiċli ħafna.
There was not much chance of that.	Ma kienx hemm wisq ċans ta’ dan.
In fact, no, no it doesn’t.	Fil-fatt, le, le ma jagħmilx hekk.
Not sure how.	Mhux ċert kif.
I don’t know much about it.	Ma nafx wisq dwarha.
Whatever is wrong, you can tell me.	Hu x’inhu ħażin, tista’ tgħidli.
This is a really good thing.	Din hija ħaġa tassew tajba.
And not everything is what it seems.	U mhux kollox huwa dak li jidher.
You know exactly where it comes from.	Taf eżatt minn fejn ġej.
Not so the first time.	Mhux hekk l-ewwel darba.
Either everyone should have or no one.	Jew kulħadd għandu jkollu jew ħadd.
It's still here.	Għadu hawn.
I can't see.	Ma nistax nara.
But you are now.	Imma int issa.
And it was great.	U kien kbir.
This has happened recently.	Dan ġara dan l-aħħar.
She didn’t even know why she was here.	Lanqas kienet taf għaliex kienet hawn.
It was something anyone could do.	Kienet xi ħaġa li kulħadd jista’ jagħmel.
I am doing what you tell me.	Qed nagħmel dak li tgħidli.
He stays there.	Huwa jibqa 'hemmhekk.
She is now back home.	Issa hija lura d-dar.
Better, do nothing.	Aħjar, ma tagħmel xejn.
And it may not be, too.	U jista 'ma jkunx, ukoll.
He did well.	Huwa għamel tajjeb.
Maybe it doesn’t have to be that way.	Forsi m'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
I couldn't hear anything.	Ma stajt nisma’ xejn.
It can’t be good.	Ma jistax ikun tajjeb.
This is the same way.	Dan huwa l-istess mod.
It was early in the evening.	Kien kmieni filgħaxija.
He always wants to say that.	Huwa dejjem irid jgħid dan.
I heard about it.	Smajt dwar dan.
You come last.	Inti tiġi l-aħħar.
It's enough.	Huwa biżżejjed.
As it was, it didn't.	Kif kien, ma.
But it didn’t have to be good.	Imma ma kellux għalfejn ikun tajjeb.
Or you can stay home.	Jew tista 'toqgħod id-dar.
It's as it should be.	Huwa kif għandu jkun.
There was no going back now.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda tmur lura issa.
He had come out again.	Huwa kien ħareġ mill-ġdid.
It was hard to sit down.	Kien diffiċli li toqgħod bilqiegħda.
Try the following.	Ipprova dan li ġej.
You were always small.	Int dejjem kont żgħir.
It usually was.	Normalment kienet.
You always are.	Int dejjem.
But not too far back.	Imma mhux wisq lura.
Too late for that now.	Tard wisq għal dak issa.
Nothing like this happened.	Ma ġara xejn bħal dan.
Obviously he would have been here tonight.	Ovvjament kien ikun hawn illejla.
But here it goes.	Imma hawn imur.
I’m not sure why it would be so.	M'inix ċert għaliex ikun hekk.
Not you either.	Le inti lanqas.
And supposedly there.	U suppost hemm.
Not coming back, my son.	Mhux qed jiġi lura, tifel tiegħi.
This has never happened to me before.	Dan qatt ma ġara lili qabel.
Once, only once.	Darba, darba biss.
He will play alone.	Huwa se jilgħab waħdu.
No one ever thought to do that.	Ħadd qatt ma ħaseb li jagħmel hekk.
This is going well.	Dan sejjer tajjeb.
He never came yours.	Hu qatt ma daħal tiegħek.
I’m not sure how I do that.	M'inix ċert kif nagħmel dan.
I wonder if all is well.	Nistaqsi jekk kollox hux tajjeb.
I can’t be happier.	Ma nistax inkun kuntent.
It may take a while.	Jista 'jieħu ftit.
Neither is she.	Lanqas hi.
We did.	Għamilna.
But this is not how it works.	Imma dan mhux kif jaħdem.
I don’t know about that.	Ma nafx dwar dan.
Really, you have to go now.	Tassew, għandek tmur issa.
You don’t have to be always talking.	M'għandekx għalfejn tkun dejjem titkellem.
Look at the door.	Ħares lejn il-bieb.
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi mhux.
I had to see.	Kelli nara.
But you will be fine.	Imma int se tkun tajjeb.
We want it to be more than that.	Irridu li jkun aktar minn hekk.
It was just the time.	Kien biss iż-żmien.
But first you have to stay.	Imma l-ewwel trid toqgħod.
But obviously she wasn’t there.	Imma ovvjament hi ma kinitx hemm.
It still works.	Għadu jaħdem.
Come and eat.	Ejja u tiekol.
But you see something else entirely.	Imma tara xi ħaġa oħra għal kollox.
It was so bad.	Kien daqshekk ħażin.
Well, they were.	Tajjeb ukoll, kienu.
It would only take a lot of time.	Ikun biss jieħu ħafna ħin.
It was very difficult to talk to him.	Kien diffiċli ħafna li titkellem miegħu.
You are with me.	Int miegħi.
Someone to talk to.	Xi ħadd biex titkellem.
I wanted to do that for a long time.	Jien ridt nagħmel hekk għal żmien twil.
He never knew where he was.	Hu qatt ma kien jaf fejn kien.
Maybe he didn’t have one.	Forsi ma kellux wieħed.
I didn’t even say anything.	Jien lanqas għidt xejn.
Maybe, if anything, it’s too late.	Forsi, jekk xejn, huwa tard wisq.
Well, no one knows yet.	Ukoll, ħadd għadu ma jaf.
It's not your job.	Mhuwiex xogħol tiegħek.
It's like work now.	Huwa bħal xogħol issa.
That’s all he wants to know.	Dan huwa dak kollu li jrid ikun jaf.
The only way is from here.	L-uniku mod huwa minn hawn.
Maybe just scared.	Forsi biss jibża.
He would have to do something about it.	Kien ikollu jagħmel xi ħaġa dwar dan.
Sometimes it happens.	Xi drabi jiġri.
And there are people who do that.	U hemm nies li jagħmlu dan.
It comes too.	Jiġi wisq.
But now it’s time to go.	Imma issa wasal iż-żmien li mmur.
I had nothing to say.	Ma kellix xi ngħid.
That had to be so.	Dak kellu jkun hekk.
Not now, maybe never again.	Mhux issa, forsi qatt aktar.
I just need someone to talk to.	Għandi bżonn biss lil xi ħadd biex nitkellem.
I’m glad you’re here.	Jien kuntent li qiegħed hawn.
This made for one young boy very happy.	Dan għamel għal wieħed tifel żgħir ferħan ħafna.
Nothing for me.	Xejn għalija.
It’s something you shouldn’t do.	Hija xi ħaġa li m'għandekx tagħmel.
He is there with you.	Huwa qiegħed hemm miegħek.
But she never did.	Imma qatt ma għamlet.
You will be happy with either.	Int tkun kuntent bi jew.
But no one appeared.	Imma ħadd ma deher.
It will never be the same again.	Qatt ma jerġa’ jkun l-istess.
She knew what was going on.	Kienet taf x’kien hemm.
And he seems to have done both.	U jidher li għamel it-tnejn.
There is nothing more out there.	M'hemm xejn aktar hemmhekk.
It says everything that goes.	Tgħid dak kollu li jmur.
They usually do.	Normalment jagħmlu.
And no I didn’t.	U le ma kontx.
So she thinks now.	Hekk taħseb hi issa.
She needed nothing.	Ma kellha bżonn xejn.
And that’s a beautiful thing to see.	U dik hija ħaġa sabiħa li tara.
We know it happened.	Nafu li ġara.
It was hard to tell.	Kien diffiċli li tgħid.
You do it at home.	Inti tagħmel dan id-dar.
This really can be.	Dan jista 'verament ikun.
She knew it was good.	Kienet taf li kien tajjeb.
How much, no one knows.	Kemm, ħadd ma jista’ jkun jaf.
Not if he can wait.	Mhux jekk jista’ jistenna.
He also knew the truth.	Kien jaf ukoll il-verità.
It could have been there.	Seta’ kien hemm.
How can this be ?.	Kif jista' jkun dan?.
This may not be what you want.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx dak li trid.
That's all there is.	Dak kollu hemm.
Once I was a boy.	Darba kont tifel.
It always has and always will.	Dejjem għandu u dejjem se.
Wondering why she did.	Mintix għaliex għamlet.
Great back and forth.	Kbir lura u lura.
He was so good to us.	Huwa kien daqshekk tajjeb għalina.
It should stay the same.	Għandu jibqa’ l-istess.
He was expecting this, of course.	Huwa kien jistenna dan, ovvjament.
He does this to everyone.	Jagħmel dan lil kulħadd.
He usually does.	Normalment jagħmel hekk.
We know he will win.	Nafu li se jirbaħ.
So it really seemed.	Hekk deher verament.
I have a lot.	Għandi ħafna.
But now was not a good time.	Imma issa ma kienx żmien tajjeb.
This was happening more and more.	Dan kien qed jiġri dejjem aktar.
Just a man.	Biss raġel.
He didn’t want to go.	Ma riedx li tmur.
He may have lost right there.	Jista’ jkun li tilef eżatt hemmhekk.
She didn’t know if she was right or not.	Ma kinitx taf jekk kellux raġun jew le.
It’s bad, very, very bad.	Hija ħażina, ħafna, ħażina ħafna.
It has been here for a year now.	Ilu hawn għal sena issa.
Hard to say so now.	Diffiċli ngħid hekk issa.
I can do much better.	Nista’ nagħmel ħafna aħjar.
I hope there is another.	Nispera li jkun hemm ieħor.
This was not a good idea.	Din ma kinitx idea tajba.
If not today, tomorrow.	Jekk mhux illum, għada.
There seems to be nothing wrong.	Jidher li m'hemm xejn ħażin.
It will take longer than that.	Se jieħu aktar żmien minn hekk.
He didn’t need to.	Ma kellux bżonn.
It was too much already.	Kien wisq diġà.
This is very wrong.	Dan huwa ħażin ħafna.
I’m just tired, that’s all.	Jien biss għajjien, huwa kollox.
But it was enough.	Imma kien biżżejjed.
That’s what was wrong.	Dak hu li kien ħażin.
But tomorrow we know more.	Imma għada nafu aktar.
He looked around.	Huwa ħares madwar.
He died shortly afterwards.	Huwa miet ftit wara.
It was the same for me.	Kien l-istess għalija.
I have fun I have fun at work.	Jien nieħu gost nieħu gost fuq ix-xogħol.
He was worried.	Kien inkwetat.
It’s good for a few.	Huwa tajjeb għal ftit.
Maybe he is.	Forsi hu.
We have it all.	Għandna dan kollu.
We both know why it’s going.	It-tnejn nafu għaliex sejjer.
And you want to talk to each other.	U trid titkellem ma’ xulxin.
You're so good tonight.	Int tant tajjeb illejla.
When you eat, you only eat.	Meta tiekol, tiekol biss.
I want to tell you.	Irrid ngħidlek.
But that’s me.	Imma dak jien.
We were just a little late.	Konna biss ftit tard.
All that will never go away.	Dak kollu mhu se jmur qatt.
Too much time.	Wisq ħin.
It has to be who he is.	Għandu jkun min hu.
I want to know more about this.	Irrid inkun naf aktar dwar dan.
Kellha.	Kellha.
It happened quickly.	Ġara malajr.
You know nothing.	Ma taf xejn.
He is your friend.	Huwa ħabib tiegħek.
And that’s the same with me.	U dak hu l-istess miegħi.
I'm so.	Jien hekk.
But it's always late.	Imma hu dejjem tard.
That’s what we needed.	Dak hu li kellna bżonn.
Only that will not work.	Biss dak mhux se jaħdem.
You'll take yours.	Int ser tieħu tiegħek.
It was a little too late too.	Kien ftit wisq tard wisq.
He said something very beautiful.	Qal xi ħaġa sabiħa ħafna.
From the outside, everything seems easy.	Minn barra, kollox jidher faċli.
I think he was tired.	Naħseb li kien għajjien.
Nothing has come yet.	Għadu ma ġie xejn.
There is no one there.	M'hemm ħadd hemm.
We would.	Aħna kieku .
If not, he would never know.	Jekk le, qatt ma kien ikun jaf.
I don’t actually know.	Fil-fatt ma nafx.
I wanted to be something, too.	Jien ridt inkun xi ħaġa, ukoll.
What he always wanted.	Dak li dejjem ried.
It’s really more than anyone can expect.	Huwa verament aktar milli kulħadd jista 'jistenna.
The problem was that we already knew each other.	Il-problema kienet li diġà nafu lil xulxin.
It’s really, really bad.	Huwa tassew, tassew ħażin.
All alone can ever be.	Kollha waħedha tista 'qatt tkun.
I'll be fine.	Jien ser inkun tajjeb.
No one is alone.	Ħadd mhu waħdu.
I tell you so.	Jien ngħidlek hekk.
They do so little.	Huma jagħmlu hekk ftit.
He told me so.	Huwa qalli hekk.
It’s like either you or me.	Huwa bħal jew int jew jien.
Someone has to be.	Xi ħadd irid ikun.
That is to be expected.	Dak wieħed jista’ jistenna.
It's a way.	Huwa mod.
That is for sure.	Dan huwa ċert.
Nothing remains forever what it was.	Xejn ma jibqa għal dejjem dak li kien.
There is none of this here.	M'hemm xejn minn dan hawn.
Everyone seems happy enough.	Kulħadd jidher kuntent biżżejjed.
This went well for some time.	Dan mar tajjeb għal xi żmien.
I'm a good man.	Jien raġel tajjeb.
I can’t think about it right now.	Ma nistax naħseb dwarha bħalissa.
You are doing too much.	Int qed tagħmel wisq.
There was little time to do anything.	Kien hemm ftit ħin biex tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I’m glad you’re not.	Jien ferħan li m'intix.
That had too much.	Dan kellu wisq.
I’m not expecting so much.	Jien mhux qed nistenna daqshekk.
I am, of course.	Jien, ovvjament.
I don’t think much about it.	Ma naħsibx ħafna dwarha.
You know you couldn’t.	Taf li ma setax.
But you don’t want to do that.	Imma inti ma tridx tagħmel dan.
I hope you do more.	Nispera li tagħmel aktar.
It was always there for me.	Dejjem kien hemm għalija.
She was not alone.	Ma kinitx waħedha.
She knew it.	Hija kienet taf dan.
It's not there.	Mhuwiex hemm.
You have come and told me.	Għandek ġejt u qalli.
He didn’t want you to know he knew.	Ma riedx li tkun taf li kien jaf.
he said.	hu qal.
But there was one thing he had to do first.	Imma kien hemm ħaġa waħda li kellu jagħmel l-ewwel.
And it should.	U għandu.
Everything is ready to go.	Kollox huwa lest biex imur.
It was something we did a lot.	Kienet xi ħaġa li għamilna ħafna.
I wish he was.	Nixtieq li hu.
I was one I am.	Jien kont wieħed jien.
You'll know when it comes.	Int tkun taf meta tiġi.
There may be more.	Jista' jkun hemm aktar.
He could, but he wouldn't.	Seta’, imma ma kienx se.
It may not even be there.	Jista’ jkun li lanqas ikun hemm.
I hope it won’t happen to me.	Nittama li mhux se jiġri lili.
You can be.	Int li tista’ tkun.
For some people this is a good thing.	Għal xi nies din hija ħaġa tajba.
He never arrived.	Hu qatt ma wasal.
He was doing more work for us.	Kien qed jagħmel aktar xogħol għalina.
It was too much.	Kien wisq.
I’m back at work now.	Jien lura fuq ix-xogħol issa.
Try it.	Jipprova.
He did not know what to think.	Ma kienx jaf x’għandu jaħseb.
Someone was saying it might be, you know.	Xi ħadd kien qed jgħid li jista’ jkun, taf.
She always did things early.	Hija dejjem għamlet l-affarijiet kmieni.
He was a good person.	Kien persuna tajba.
That's what a man looks like.	Hekk jidher raġel.
He may be telling the truth.	Jista’ jkun li qed jgħid il-verità.
But that was almost not enough.	Imma dak kważi ma kienx biżżejjed.
But everything felt bad.	Imma kollox ħassu ħażin.
There is no other way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor.
I’m not saying that now.	Jien ma ngħid hekk issa.
It's not that.	Mhuwiex dak.
But you will be the last.	Imma int tkun l-aħħar.
Not by anyone, actually.	Mhux minn ħadd, fil-fatt.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn li seta’ jagħmel dwarha.
I’m pretty sure it’s just so.	Jien pjuttost ċert li huwa biss hekk.
But last night.	Imma lbieraħ filgħaxija.
She is good with him.	Hija tajba miegħu.
He died a year later.	Miet sena wara.
That you have.	Li għandek.
Surely we can do better than that, he thought.	Żgur li nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar minn hekk, ħaseb.
And she seems not alone.	U jidher li mhix waħedha.
I never thought it would happen.	Qatt ma ħsibt li se jiġri.
If it’s too late for you, the above can help someone else.	Jekk tard wisq għalik, hawn fuq jista 'jgħin lil xi ħadd ieħor.
I would never tell anyone either.	Jien qatt ma ngħid lil ħadd lanqas.
Everything was too late.	Kollox kien tard wisq.
He knew how to play.	Kien jaf jilgħab.
You come with me.	Inti tiġi miegħi.
You are not there.	M'intix hemm.
Probably not enough.	Probabbilment mhux biżżejjed.
There is always someone.	Dejjem hemm xi ħadd.
I don’t want him to be unhappy.	Ma rridx li ma jkunx kuntent.
It looked like he was actually worried or something.	Kien qisu kien fil-fatt inkwetat jew xi ħaġa.
That was a great thing.	Din kienet ħaġa kbira.
Here's one way to do it.	Hawn mod wieħed biex tagħmel dan.
If you want, you can come with me.	Jekk trid, tista’ tiġi miegħi.
But you're ready.	Imma int lest.
He knew exactly what to do.	Kien jaf eżatt x'għandu jagħmel.
He never thought about it.	Hu qatt ma ħaseb dwarha.
Everything was still there.	Kollox kien għadu hemm.
There is a way, of course.	Hemm mod, ovvjament.
I always thought there would be more time.	Dejjem ħsibt li jkun hemm aktar ħin.
Good teacher.	Għalliem tajjeb.
But we can't.	Imma ma nistgħux.
Maybe, by now, I heard.	Forsi, sa issa, smajt.
He won't really say.	Huwa mhux se verament jgħid.
We always have, and always will.	Dejjem għandna, u dejjem se.
We have to do this.	Irridu nagħmlu dan.
It doesn’t seem happy.	Ma jidhirx ferħan.
I did the same with him.	Jien għamilt l-istess miegħu.
It may not be.	Jista 'ma jkunx.
But of course it would.	Imma ovvjament kieku.
Back to top.	Lura għal fuq.
But there is no way to know.	Imma m'hemm l-ebda mod biex tkun taf.
He didn't want to.	Hu ma riedx .
I know enough to do that.	Naf biżżejjed biex nagħmel dan.
This doesn’t look right to you.	Dan ma jidhirx tajjeb għalik.
He wasn’t going.	Ma kienx sejjer.
And we know.	U nafu.
Looks like it never was.	Qisu qatt ma kien.
You will not tell me.	Inti mhux se tgħidli.
That was all a man needed.	Dak kien kull ma kellu bżonn raġel.
Good, good, very good.	Tajjeb, tajjeb, tajjeb ħafna.
That was yesterday, and this today.	Dak kien ilbieraħ, u dan illum.
Everything was happening properly.	Kollox kien qed jiġri kif suppost.
He never asked.	Hu qatt ma talab.
Both were on now.	It-tnejn kienu fuq issa.
And they are.	U huma.
He saw enough of this.	Huwa ra biżżejjed minn dan.
There was no one around.	Ma kien hemm ħadd madwar.
I thought so, too.	Ħsibt hekk, ukoll.
He is still young.	Għadu żgħir.
He never could.	Hu qatt ma seta.
It's for me.	Huwa għalija.
That's all.	Dan huwa kollox.
I have a school boy here.	Għandi tifel l-iskola hawn.
And this is how it should be.	U dan huwa kif għandu jkun.
It could be too.	Jista’ jkun ukoll.
I still think.	Għadni naħseb.
I’m not doing that.	Jien mhux qed nagħmel dan.
I was always ready.	Jien dejjem kont lest.
Obviously I don’t want to do that.	Ovvjament ma rridx nagħmel dan.
With a little.	Bi ftit.
Well, that was it.	Ukoll, dak kien.
He had said he was thinking about it.	Huwa kien qal li kien jaħseb dwarha.
You know what they're doing.	Taf x’qed jagħmlu.
But not to everyone.	Imma mhux lil kulħadd.
Not there yet.	Għadu mhux hemm.
Nor is this one.	Lanqas dan huwa wieħed.
It comes with an early morning.	Jiġi ma 'filgħodu kmieni.
I have to think about that.	Ikolli naħseb fuq dan.
I'm busy here.	Jien okkupat hawn.
Everyone is alone.	Kulħadd hu waħdu.
This is what they are for.	Dan huwa dak li huma għal.
Obviously, there is nothing you can do now.	Ovvjament, m'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel issa.
This is just good.	Dan huwa biss tajjeb.
And maybe he was right.	U forsi kellu raġun.
We just.	Aħna biss.
I still have that problem.	Għadni għandi dik il-problema.
If you go one way.	Jekk tmur mod wieħed.
And that's it.	U dak hu.
I would be fine.	Inkun tajjeb.
Which is good when everything works.	Li huwa tajjeb meta kollox jaħdem.
I just heard.	Smajt biss.
There was only one way to do this.	Kien hemm mod wieħed biss kif seta’ jagħmel dan.
This was really happening.	Dan verament kien qed jiġri.
Let's just.	Ejja biss.
She is so good.	Hija daqshekk tajba.
And not just for a few people.	U mhux biss għal ftit nies.
That was your good idea.	Dik kienet idea tajba tiegħek.
It was the only thing she had to do, he was sure.	Kienet l-unika ħaġa li kellha tagħmel, kien ċert.
It could be anyone.	Jista’ jkun xi ħadd.
That’s ready now.	Dak lest issa.
He loved the car.	Kien iħobb il-karozza.
Not about it.	Mhux dwarha.
You never know !.	Qatt ma tkun taf!.
But she is.	Imma hi.
Maybe if.	Forsi se.
He had a pretty bad time.	Huwa kellu żmien pjuttost ħażin.
He saw me first.	Huwa ra lili l-ewwel.
It may already be there.	Jista 'jkun diġà hemm.
I knew a better way.	Kont naf mod aħjar.
I couldn’t do that now.	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan issa.
He thought he would.	Huwa ħaseb li kieku.
Our job is what we are.	Ix-xogħol tagħna huwa dak li aħna.
He doesn't seem to need to talk.	Jidher li m’għandux bżonn jitkellem.
I was happy about that.	Kont ferħan b’dan.
I'm glad you're happy.	Jien kuntent li int kuntent.
I can't understand why.	Ma nistax nifhem għaliex.
I’m not even supposed to be here.	Jien lanqas suppost inkun hawn.
We were so back.	Konna daqshekk lura.
This is where it comes from.	Dan huwa minn fejn ġej.
Not bad, nothing wrong.	Mhux ħażin, xejn ħażin.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Seta’ jagħmel dak kollu li jrid.
And it works as a whole.	U jaħdem kollu kemm hu.
Not for everyone.	Mhux għal kulħadd.
It's just big enough.	Huwa biss kbir biżżejjed.
Something wrong there.	Xi ħaġa ħażina hemmhekk.
But we did what we had to.	Imma għamilna dak li kellna.
It was wrong.	Kien ħażin.
I heard everything and nothing.	Smajt kollox u xejn.
So it would have been.	Hekk kien ikun.
After a while they felt better.	Wara ftit ħin ħassu aħjar.
Not much more, but little.	Mhux wisq aktar, imma ftit.
Now you can eat anything.	Issa tista' tiekol xi ħaġa.
It’s too big for us.	Huwa kbir wisq għalina.
Today he is.	Illum hu .
He was right there.	Huwa kien hemm eżatt.
He may be saying that.	Jista’ jkun li qed jgħid hekk.
It goes something like this.	Hija tmur xi ħaġa bħal din.
You should know.	Għandek tkun taf.
It would be a problem.	Ikun problema.
He was out.	Huwa kien barra.
You’re good, good enough to go home.	Int tajjeb, tajjeb biżżejjed biex tmur id-dar.
He said it was mine.	Qal li huwa tiegħi.
This works.	Dan jaħdem.
That seems to have gone well.	Li jidher li mar tajjeb.
It wasn’t for everyone.	Ma kienx għal kulħadd.
For some people.	Għal xi nies.
Like too much.	Bħal wisq.
He didn’t have to.	Ma kellux għalfejn.
Sit down.	Poġġa bilqiegħda.
After that, my time is mine.	Wara dan, il-ħin tiegħi huwa tiegħi.
It’s money, money, money.	Huwa flus, flus, flus.
It doesn’t seem to work.	Ma jidhirx li jaħdem.
This happens very often.	Dan jiġri ħafna drabi.
She was talking about something or nothing.	Kienet titkellem dwar xi ħaġa jew xejn.
Someone else came.	Xi ħadd ieħor daħal.
No one knows who we were.	Ħadd ma jkun jaf li konna aħna.
He asked about this a while ago.	Huwa staqsa dwar dan ftit ilu.
You should be back by then.	Għandek tkun lura sa dak iż-żmien.
He always did.	Huwa dejjem għamel.
We had no one.	Ma kellna lil ħadd.
As he always did.	Kif dejjem għamel.
For me, it was great.	Għalija, kien kbir.
It was really beautiful.	Kienet tassew sabiħa.
It can be wonderful.	Tista’ tkun ħaġa sabiħa.
He was one of me.	Kien wieħed minni.
Just for him.	Biss għalih.
This will always get better.	Dan jibqa' dejjem aħjar.
A little, to tell you the truth.	Ftit, biex ngħidlek il-verità.
He would buy again.	Kieku jerġa' jixtri.
But it was never you.	Imma qatt ma kont int.
We don’t have time for that.	M'għandniex ħin għal dan.
Who was watching someone else.	Min kien qed jara lil xi ħadd ieħor.
I hope he never has to come to this.	Nittama li qatt ma jkollu jasal għal dan.
I'm glad you're here.	Jien kuntent li int hawn.
That’s long enough.	Dak huwa twil biżżejjed.
He will not play with me.	Mhux se jilgħab miegħi.
I was there to see.	Jien kont hemm biex nara.
It will be quick and easy.	Se jkun malajr u faċli.
If you want something bad enough, do it.	Jekk trid xi ħaġa ħażina biżżejjed, tagħmel dan.
You can tell me now.	Inti tista 'tgħidli issa.
Nothing there, either.	Xejn hemm, lanqas.
Just want to say.	Biss trid ngħid.
As I said.	Kif għedt.
And why now.	U għaliex issa.
He needs to do well.	Jeħtieġ li jagħmel tajjeb.
This is all you need to know.	Dan huwa dak kollu li għandek bżonn tkun taf.
There is only this.	Hemm biss dan.
It can happen and it can happen now.	Jista’ jiġri u jista’ jiġri issa.
Easy but bad.	Faċli imma ħażin.
Neither is he perhaps.	Lanqas hu forsi.
Everything is working now.	Kollox qed jaħdem issa.
I didn’t regret it.	Ma kontx jiddispjaċini.
Not people, that’s for sure.	Mhux nies, dan żgur.
.	.
It will be very difficult for me.	Se jkun diffiċli ħafna għalija.
It’s time to talk now.	Wasal iż-żmien li jitkellem issa.
It may be too much for him.	Jista 'jkun wisq għalih.
You can do that too.	Tista 'tagħmel dan ukoll.
It's really good.	Huwa tassew tajjeb.
I just need to know where they are.	Għandi bżonn biss inkun naf fejn huma.
Some other time.	Xi żmien ieħor.
It does.	Hekk jagħmel.
No one seems to know what happened.	Ħadd ma jidher li jaf x’ġara.
Just that one.	Biss dak wieħed.
If he doesn’t, it’s a bad thing.	Jekk ma jagħmilx hekk, hija ħaġa ħażina.
It's what it's not.	Huwa dak li mhuwiex.
You also know that you are not a person.	Taf ukoll li m'intix persuna.
Why could it be ?.	Għaliex jista 'jkun?.
Man, she was beautiful.	Raġel, kienet sabiħa.
It is very early.	Huwa kmieni ħafna.
And not just me, everyone.	U mhux jien biss, kulħadd.
Talking is hard.	Titkellem huwa diffiċli.
Great to see.	Kbir biex tara.
That's not good.	Dak mhux tajjeb.
I can’t wait to do these again.	Ma nistax nistenna li nagħmel dawn mill-ġdid.
Which are better.	Li huma aħjar.
He had only started for one year.	Huwa kien beda biss għal sena waħda.
But I couldn’t.	Imma ma stajtx.
I'm not good.	Jien mhux tajjeb.
Come with me.	Ejja miegħi.
I just want to be alone.	Irrid biss inkun waħdi.
And she did.	U hi ma.
It's going so well.	Huwa sejjer hekk tajjeb.
He always has to.	Huwa dejjem għandu.
But now it’s not working.	Imma issa mhux qed jaħdem.
But he is not.	Imma hu mhux hekk.
You take yours.	Int tieħu tiegħek.
I’m pretty sure this is it.	Jien pjuttost ċert li dan hu.
I would like to know.	Nixtieq inkun naf.
Until years later.	Sa snin wara.
It's not good.	Mhuwiex tajjeb.
You can go home if you want.	Tista’ tmur lura d-dar jekk trid.
There is no other way to see things.	M'hemm l-ebda mod ieħor biex tara l-affarijiet.
I know this doesn’t help at all.	Naf li dan ma jgħin xejn.
He sat back and thought.	Poġġa lura u ħaseb.
I was thinking.	Jien kont qed naħseb.
I will not think.	M'iniex se naħseb.
No one knows where he is.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn hu.
Great job for everyone around.	Xogħol kbir għal kulħadd madwar.
So it’s nothing.	Hekk mhu xejn.
Not everything died.	Mhux kollox miet.
Yesterday was nothing.	Ilbieraħ ma kien xejn.
Neither is he.	Lanqas hu.
I’m just a kid.	Jien biss xi tifel.
No, rather than scared.	Le, aktar milli jibża.
You are the first on this one.	Int l-ewwel fuq dan wieħed.
I wonder what he is doing.	Nistaqsi x’qed jagħmel.
I tell you now.	Ngħidlek issa.
And there will never be one.	U qatt mhu se jkun hemm wieħed.
Everything is there.	Kollox hemm.
One thing she did.	Ħaġa waħda għamlet.
Not too early.	Mhux kmieni wisq.
For too long.	Għal żmien twil wisq.
I didn’t have time for that.	Ma kellix ħin għal dan.
Now, you may think we are ready.	Issa, inti tista 'taħseb li aħna lest.
Today, things are much better.	Illum, l-affarijiet huma ħafna aħjar.
You really, really don’t need everything.	Int verament, verament m'għandekx bżonn dak kollu.
I didn’t say anything more.	Jien ma għidt xejn aktar.
Everything was ready.	Dak kollu kien lest.
And now it had been.	U issa kien ġie.
Same thing with this.	L-istess ħaġa ma' dan.
But it was not always so.	Imma mhux dejjem kien hekk.
He was a very good boy.	Kien tifel tajjeb ħafna.
He doesn’t want to go home with me.	Ma jridx imur id-dar miegħi.
He was obviously trying to be helpful.	Huwa kien ovvjament jipprova jkun ta 'għajnuna.
It’s still the same time.	Għadu l-istess ħin.
It’s all he does.	Huwa dak kollu li jagħmel.
He seems really worried.	Jidher tassew inkwetat.
It takes a lot of work.	Jeħtieġ ħafna xogħol.
Which is not the same thing.	Li mhix l-istess ħaġa.
He says he does.	Jgħid li jagħmel.
How fast it was.	Kemm kien malajr.
He didn’t expect it to be so big.	Ma kienx jistenna li jkun daqshekk kbir.
It's late.	Hija tard.
And we don’t always want that.	U dan mhux dejjem irridu.
I want to be able to do something.	Irrid inkun kapaċi nagħmel xi ħaġa.
The same thing happened every time.	L-istess ħaġa ġara kull darba.
He stays with me.	Hu jibqa miegħi.
It goes back many years.	Jmur lura ħafna snin.
I didn’t know how I was going to do it.	Ma kontx naf kif se nagħmel.
Well, of course.	Ukoll, ovvjament.
I thought I’d go back.	Ħsibt li mmur lura.
It has always been so.	Dejjem kien hekk.
Did you know you can’t.	Kont taf li ma tistax.
I don't want to hear about it.	Ma rrid nisma’ xejn dwarha.
He doesn’t talk much.	Ma tantx titkellem.
And it couldn’t be done.	U ma setax isir.
That’s you and me.	Dak int u jien.
Not that this happened to me.	Mhux li dan ġara lili.
Or, you don’t have to.	Jew, m'għandekx għalfejn.
He needs to see where he is.	Jeħtieġ li jara fejn qiegħed.
That has to be where it is.	Dak irid ikun fejn hu.
He did for you exactly what He did for me.	Huwa għamel għalik eżatt dak li għamel miegħi.
It is working for us right now.	Qed jaħdem għalina bħalissa.
She had done nothing.	Ma kienet għamlet xejn.
I was ready to tell you everything.	Kont lest ngħidlek kollox.
But no one has done anything like that.	Imma ħadd ma għamel xi ħaġa bħal din.
I came here to talk.	Ġejt hawn biex nitkellem.
But that was good.	Imma dan kien tajjeb.
She was kind to him and always helpful.	Kienet tajba miegħu u dejjem ta’ għajnuna.
He would never do such a thing.	Qatt ma kien jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din.
Ready when you are.	Lest meta tkun.
I understand that this often happens.	Nifhem li spiss jiġri hekk.
Sorry, he says.	Jiddispjaċini, jgħid.
And it was better.	U kien aħjar.
You can too.	Inti tista 'ukoll.
She needed more, much more.	Hija kellha bżonn aktar, ħafna aktar.
It probably never will.	X'aktarx qatt ma se.
We want to do better.	Irridu nagħmlu aħjar.
But not so today.	Imma mhux hekk illum.
But here it goes.	Imma hawn imur.
But no one has been able to do that yet.	Imma ħadd għadu ma seta’ jagħmel dan.
These are people.	Dawn huma nies.
I doubt it a bit.	Niddubita ftit dwar dan.
Many have now.	Ħafna għandhom issa.
This had happened to me before.	Dan kien ġara lili qabel.
And that was a very good thing.	U dik kienet ħaġa tajba ħafna.
No job is too small.	L-ebda xogħol mhu żgħir wisq.
And there is the problem.	U hemm il-problema.
I saw you do it.	Rajt inti tagħmel dan.
It comes just a little bit.	Jiġi ftit ftit.
I didn't go to you.	Jien ma mort għandek.
Sure enough, there was.	Żgur biżżejjed, kien hemm.
She really is.	Hi tassew.
For over a year.	Għal aktar minn sena.
He could come and go as he pleased.	Seta’ jiġi u jmur kif irid.
Work can wait.	Ix-xogħol jista' jistenna.
Now that.	Issa li.
Here’s what’s really going to happen.	Hawn x'inhu verament se jiġri.
I'm always ready.	Jien dejjem lest.
He is who he was.	Huwa min kien.
I just need to do a few things.	Għandi bżonn biss nagħmel ftit affarijiet.
I wanted it so well.	Ridt hekk tajjeb.
She will never speak.	Hija qatt mhu se titkellem.
.	.
He just plays with you.	Huwa biss jilgħab miegħek.
But not all are so.	Imma mhux kollha huma hekk.
It's not hard.	Mhuwiex diffiċli.
A lot of people are there.	Ħafna nies hemm.
He saw things.	Huwa ra l-affarijiet.
He doesn't know.	Ma jafx.
Like, alone.	Bħal, waħdu.
And here.	U hawn.
It was out of there.	Kien barra minn hemm.
I need to understand why he did what he did.	Għandi bżonn nifhem għaliex għamel dak li għamel.
You can only do as much as you can.	Tista 'biss tagħmel kemm tista'.
Nothing happens.	Ma jiġri xejn.
He’s not there, you know.	Hu mhux hemmhekk, taf.
Not so fast.	Mhux daqshekk malajr.
Don't go back there.	M'għandekx tmur lura hemm.
He saw it all.	Huwa ra dan kollu.
Wrong every time.	Ħażin kull darba.
Well, better than that, actually.	Ukoll, aħjar minn hekk, fil-fatt.
And there is so much more you can do.	U hemm ħafna aktar li tista 'tagħmel.
But that was something he didn’t want.	Imma dik kienet xi ħaġa li ma riedx.
I was so surprised when I saw this.	Kont tant sorpriż meta nara dan.
I don't know.	Jien ma nafx.
This was not happening.	Dan ma kienx qed jiġri.
For many people, this is not a big deal.	Għal ħafna nies, din mhix xi ħaġa kbira.
Everything should work fine.	Kollox għandu jaħdem tajjeb.
You don’t do that, you don’t do that.	Ma tagħmilx dan, ma tagħmilx hekk.
I'm not good at all.	Jien ma tajjeb xejn.
If he can.	Jekk jista’.
It's yours alone.	Huwa tiegħek biss.
He had arrived.	Huwa kien wasal.
And we don't.	U m’għandniex.
I’m telling you the truth.	Qed ngħidlek il-verità.
Really, you.	Tassew, inti.
He just will.	Huwa biss se.
They are always there for you.	Huma dejjem hemm għalik.
She had to do something, and quickly.	Kellha tagħmel xi ħaġa, u malajr.
You are no longer what you used to be.	M'intix aktar dak li kont.
And now we know we can.	U issa nafu li nistgħu.
Everything else is seated.	Kollox ieħor huwa bilqiegħda.
No, you are not alone.	Le, m'intix waħdek.
I’m not going to do anything.	Jien mhu se nagħmel xejn.
He wanted to go.	Ried imur.
That no one was.	Li ħadd ma kien.
You have to plan ahead.	Trid tippjana minn qabel.
They do, you know.	Jagħmlu, taf.
I think that would be a great idea.	Naħseb li tkun idea kbira.
It could be anyone.	Jista’ jkun xi ħadd.
He wants a man.	Irid raġel.
That was it, so far.	Dan kien, sa issa.
That's easy.	Dik hija faċli.
This is not forever.	Dan mhux għal dejjem.
I'm a boy.	Jien tifel.
Tonight we will be there.	Illejla nkunu hemm.
Well, not for long.	Ukoll, mhux għal żmien twil.
I used to listen to one every morning.	Jien kont nisma’ wieħed kull filgħodu.
Today we know better.	Illum nafu aħjar.
Everything was done to me.	Kollox sar miegħi.
Probably should.	Probabbilment għandu.
I had no idea of ​​that.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea ta 'dan.
The car was still.	Il-karozza kienet għadha.
Now everyone asked.	Issa kulħadd staqsa.
It will be a good size.	Huwa se jkun ta 'daqs tajjeb.
Now was a good time for him to appear.	Issa kien żmien tajjeb għalih biex jidher.
It’s good for him.	Huwa tajjeb għalih.
All of this is working as well.	Dan kollu qed jaħdem ukoll.
For every account you have.	Għal kull kont li għandek.
But if all you can do.	Imma jekk dak kollu li tista 'tagħmel.
I'm not sure it ever will.	M'inix ċert li qatt se.
But only for a short time.	Imma għal ftit żmien biss.
Just to be sure.	Biss biex tkun ċert.
And very bad.	U ħażin ħafna.
Other times, there is nothing.	Drabi oħra, m'hemm xejn.
It will do that.	Se tagħmel dan.
For a man, not good.	Għal raġel, mhux tajjeb.
But better late than never.	Imma aħjar tard milli qatt.
Good to be back.	Tajjeb li tkun lura.
It hasn’t always been that easy.	Mhux dejjem kien daqshekk faċli.
Now tell the truth.	Issa għid il-verità.
And not once.	U mhux darba.
I'll tell you something.	Jien ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
But today it is easy.	Imma llum huwa faċli.
But there is always.	Imma dejjem hemm.
Who can do this to me?	Min jista 'jagħmel lili dan?.
And many obviously not.	U ħafna ovvjament le.
.	.
I think it was a good idea.	Naħseb li kienet idea tajba.
I didn’t know anything else to say.	Ma kontx naf xi ħaġa oħra xi ngħid.
I never knew it would be so good.	Qatt ma kont naf li jista’ jkun daqshekk tajjeb.
That’s something that’s hard to do.	Dik hija xi ħaġa li hija diffiċli li tagħmel.
This may take a few hours.	Dan jista' jieħu ftit sigħat.
I was so right.	Kont tant raġun.
Maybe she knows.	Forsi hi taf.
Not so here.	Mhux hekk hawn.
It had never happened to me to even try.	Qatt ma kien ġara lili lanqas biss nipprova.
Well, not forever.	Ukoll, mhux għal dejjem.
You should know that too.	Għandek tkun taf ukoll.
It was enough he did.	Kien biżżejjed li għamel.
That was what you had to do.	Kien dak li kellek tagħmel.
Nista.	Nista .
It must be someone he knew pretty well.	Għandu jkun xi ħadd li kien jaf pjuttost tajjeb.
Not there.	Mhux hemmhekk.
He knew whose house it was.	Kien jaf li d-dar ta’ min kienet.
Everyone will know you did it.	Kulħadd ikun jaf li għamilt dan.
I didn’t want to know anything.	Ma ridt inkun naf xejn.
One for each person, please.	Wieħed għal kull persuna, jekk jogħġbok.
He wants it that way.	Huwa jrid hekk.
It was easy too.	Kien faċli wisq.
They were all tired.	Kienu kollha għajjien.
After all, it’s just me and you.	Wara kollox, hemm biss jien u int.
There is no one around.	M'hemm ħadd madwar.
But no more than that now.	Imma mhux aktar minn dak issa.
You should not, please, do so.	M'għandekx, jekk jogħġbok, tagħmel dan.
It happened every time.	Ġara kull darba.
It could be more.	Hija tista 'tkun aktar.
It’s really all here.	Huwa tassew kollu hawn.
No, nothing like that.	Le, xejn bħal dan.
I will sit down.	Jien se noqgħod bilqiegħda.
But good if you don’t.	Imma tajjeb jekk ma tagħmilx hekk.
And another person had that same idea.	U persuna oħra kellha dik l-istess idea.
It was bad then, and it’s bad now.	Kien ħażin dak iż-żmien, u huwa ħażin issa.
And you never know.	U qatt ma tkun taf.
Maybe this will work.	Forsi dan se jaħdem.
Maybe he could have done something more here.	Forsi seta’ għamel xi ħaġa aktar hawn.
That’s all you know.	Dan huwa dak kollu li taf.
He seems able to speak.	Jidher li kapaċi jitkellem.
We know it happened.	Nafu li ġara.
In fact, nothing is.	Fil-fatt, xejn mhu.
Well she wasn't.	Ukoll hi ma kienx.
She was just a boy.	Kienet biss tifel.
I was so tired.	Kont tant għajjien.
I will have to go back.	Ikolli nerġa' lura.
And this is what we have to do.	U dan huwa dak li għandna nagħmlu.
I still think that.	Għadni naħseb li.
He never is.	Hu qatt ma hu.
Maybe it will be good.	Forsi se jkun tajjeb.
If there was anyone else out there.	Jekk kienx hemm xi ħadd ieħor hemmhekk.
Not having a good year.	Mhux qed ikollu sena tajba.
Now it is.	Issa huwa.
It was his.	Kien tiegħu.
I'm happy now.	Jien kuntent issa.
I wasn’t sure what I would do or think.	Ma kontx ċert x'se nagħmel jew naħseb.
Or do something good without anyone knowing.	Jew tagħmel xi ħaġa tajba mingħajr ma jkun jaf ħadd.
You can't do me.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel lili.
There was nothing we could do about it.	Ma kien hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu dwar dan.
But obviously no one had.	Imma ovvjament ħadd ma kellu.
That doesn't look like fun!?.	Dak ma jidhirx gost!?.
He knew nothing.	Ma kien jaf xejn.
In fact, something was very wrong.	Fil-fatt, xi ħaġa kienet ħażina ħafna.
It's that.	Huwa dak.
You can talk.	Tista' titkellem.
Look like that.	Ħares hekk.
Died before he ?.	Miet qabel hu?.
What happened next he did not know.	X’ġara wara dan, ma kienx jaf.
He just does his thing.	Jagħmel biss ħaġa tiegħu.
It seems a bit.	Jidher daqsxejn.
They were always here.	Dejjem kienu hawn.
It wasn’t beautiful now.	Ma kinitx sabiħa issa.
I have a problem.	Għandi xi problema.
This is a great time to do this.	Dan huwa żmien tajjeb ħafna biex tagħmel dan.
And he won't.	U hu mhux se.
And now, here you are.	U issa, hawn int.
But not often.	Imma mhux spiss.
You can’t be together all the time.	Ma tistax tkun flimkien il-ħin kollu.
More people have jobs than ever before.	Aktar nies għandhom xogħol minn qatt qabel.
And not to everyone.	U mhux lil kulħadd.
It was pretty.	Kien pjuttost.
He said no.	Huwa qal le.
No, my friends.	Le, ħbieb tiegħi.
And it's good.	U huwa tajjeb.
Great need.	Bżonn kbir.
He will be fine.	Hu se jkun tajjeb.
I wanted to eat.	Ridt niekol.
It just doesn’t happen.	Huwa biss mhux jiġri.
I hope someone can help.	Nispera li xi ħadd jista 'jgħin.
If there is nothing better.	Jekk m'hemm xejn aħjar.
Or almost did.	Jew kważi għamel.
But it always never happens.	Imma dejjem qatt ma jiġri.
But you actually have to do something.	Imma fil-fatt trid tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I have to tell you.	Ikolli ngħidlek.
Not everything was wrong.	Mhux kollox kien ħażin.
That’s a lot of time.	Dak huwa ħafna ħin.
I hope everything goes well.	Nispera li kollox imur tajjeb.
It will make your job a lot easier.	Se tagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħek ħafna aktar faċli.
I’ve always been good.	Jien dejjem kont tajjeb.
She had a great time.	Kellha ħafna ħin.
That was a good time ago.	Dan kien żmien tajjeb ilu.
Not really eating much of anything.	Mhux verament tiekol ħafna minn xejn.
This is what we need.	Dan huwa dak li għandna bżonn.
We know it works.	Nafu li jaħdem.
But we don’t.	Imma m'għandniex.
If we.	Jekk aħna .
He seemed unable to think.	Deher li ma jistax jaħseb.
So it seems to me.	Hekk jidher lili.
But try.	Imma jipprova.
Easier for him around.	Aktar faċli għalih madwar.
You never see anyone.	Qatt ma tara lil ħadd.
It's just.	Huwa biss.
That’s probably what will happen.	Huwa probabbilment dak li se jiġri.
I think it should be.	Naħseb li għandu jkun.
They are with us forever.	Huma magħna għal dejjem.
And each of these is really hard to do.	U kull wieħed minn dawn huwa verament diffiċli li tagħmel.
I don’t know when.	Ma nafx meta.
Everyone was there.	Kulħadd kien hemm.
You’re not really here.	M'intix verament hawn.
Tomorrow tomorrow.	Għada għada.
It can’t be fast enough.	Ma jistax jiġi malajr biżżejjed.
In fact it never happened.	Fil-fatt qatt ma ġara.
It's a little small.	Huwa ftit żgħir.
Things are wrong.	L-affarijiet huma ħażin.
There will be a lot of people there.	Se jkun hemm ħafna nies hemmhekk.
I don’t say anything to anyone.	Jien ma ngħid xejn lil ħadd.
You don't.	Inti ma.
Too little and nothing will happen.	Ftit wisq u xejn mhu se jiġri.
Once a teacher, always a teacher.	Darba għalliem, dejjem għalliem.
It may or may not happen.	Jista’ jiġri jew le.
No, it was really good.	Le, kien tassew tajjeb.
It takes years and years and years.	Jieħu snin u snin u snin.
I believe it is not there.	Jiena nemmen li mhux hemm.
But nothing big.	Imma xejn kbir.
Everything I did was wrong.	Dak kollu li għamilt kien ħażin.
I just don’t know why.	Jien biss ma nafx għaliex.
It could have been otherwise.	Seta’ kien mod ieħor.
Come and go.	Ġej u sejjer.
I never knew who.	Qatt ma kont naf min.
He had no idea what was coming.	Ma kellux idea x’kien ġej.
I didn’t want to tell you before.	Ma ridtx ngħidlek qabel.
I think it might work.	Naħseb li jista 'jaħdem.
She was never right.	Qatt ma kellha raġun.
she says.	hi tgħid.
Staying out is not so good.	Li toqgħod barra mhux daqshekk tajjeb.
And he looks like me.	U hu qisu lili.
But it never was.	Imma qatt ma kien.
This so wins everything.	Dan hekk jirbaħ kollox.
I thought, maybe just.	Ħsibt, forsi biss.
But she had to.	Imma kellha.
Work came first.	Ix-xogħol ġie l-ewwel.
Sure enough, it works well.	Żgur biżżejjed, jaħdem tajjeb.
You can't do anything.	Ma tistax tagħmel xejn.
Well, it's not.	Ukoll, mhuwiex.
Everyone ready to go.	Kulħadd lest biex imur.
That was what he wanted.	Dan kien dak li ried.
And he told me everything.	U qalli kollox.
It wasn’t enough.	Ma kienx biżżejjed.
And now he was gone.	U issa kien telaq.
Never do that.	Qatt ma tagħmel dan.
She is here with me.	Hi hawn miegħi.
Maybe there's nothing anyone can do.	Forsi m’hemm xejn li xi ħadd jista’ jagħmel.
What is it after all? 	X'inhu wara kollox?
I’ve been a teacher.	Stajt kont għalliem.
They never did.	Huma qatt ma.
And there was no going back.	U ma kienx hemm tmur lura.
And this is what happens.	U dan huwa dak li jiġri.
For all she knew, it was the first time.	Għal kull ma kienet taf, kienet l-ewwel darba.
It was fun.	Kien gost.
He had done nothing.	Ma kien għamel xejn.
I think he doesn’t.	Naħseb li ma jagħmilx hekk.
You have to tell me everything.	Trid tgħidli kollox.
I think for other people.	Naħseb għal nies oħra.
Someone is not trying.	Xi ħadd mhux qed jipprova.
Not after everything that had happened.	Mhux wara dak kollu li kien ġara.
It was always so easy with him.	Dejjem kien daqshekk faċli miegħu.
I’m for one not too sure.	Jien għal wieħed mhux wisq ċert.
I will do so.	Jien se nagħmel hekk.
There is a better way.	Hemm mod aħjar.
Nor is he.	U lanqas hu.
They are all one.	Huma kollha wieħed.
And it’s good too.	U huwa tajjeb ukoll.
I’ve been able to do that.	Jien stajt nagħmel dan.
You are good.	Inti tajjeb.
I will talk to him and so on.	Jien se nitkellem miegħu u hekk.
Not everything does.	Mhux kollox jagħmel.
This now.	Dan issa.
I'm not bad.	Jien mhux ħażin.
He will come back to you.	Hu se jiġi lura għandek.
This is what is happening.	Dan huwa dak li qed jiġri.
It’s not who we are.	Mhuwiex min aħna.
But you have a problem.	Imma għandek problema.
I couldn’t think of anything else right now.	Ma stajt naħseb dwar xi ħaġa oħra bħalissa.
I’m not sure how I do that.	M'inix ċert kif nagħmel dan.
To speak your truth.	Biex titkellem il-verità tiegħek.
It needs something.	Jeħtieġ xi ħaġa.
My good.	Tiegħi tajjeb.
Whatever it was, it couldn't be right.	Kien x’kien, ma setax ikun tajjeb.
He comes to you.	Huwa jiġi għandek.
It’s too late for that as well.	Huwa tard wisq għal dak ukoll.
Probably about everything.	Probabbilment dwar kollox.
I have no money.	M'għandix flus.
I know it was.	Naf li kien.
I'm afraid it was me.	Nibża li kont jien.
I can tell you it was great.	Nista 'ngħidlek li kien kbir.
He would have known you were there.	Kien ikun jaf li int kont hemm.
It really wasn’t my problem.	Tassew ma kinitx il-problema tiegħi.
And he probably knew that.	U probabbilment kien jaf li.
I hope he never does.	Nispera li qatt ma jagħmel.
I have no idea about any of this.	M'għandi l-ebda idea dwar xi ħaġa minn dan.
It must be working.	Irid ikun qed jaħdem.
Everything happens the way you want it to.	Kollox jiġri kif tixtieq li.
That we are here is good.	Li aħna hawn huwa tajjeb.
Well, that's a problem.	Ukoll, dik hija problema.
It will be easy, no.	Se jkun faċli, le.
I can go.	Nista’ mmur.
Not just for lovers.	Mhux biss għal min iħobb.
He was scared.	Kien jibża’.
Never say you are not happy.	Qatt tgħid li m'intix kuntent.
He certainly did.	Żgur li għamel hekk.
It would be the same for you.	Ikun l-istess għalik.
Or try to be.	Jew ipprova jkun.
After hours it wasn’t much better.	Wara sigħat ma kienx ħafna aħjar.
He thinks he knows.	Jaħseb li jaf.
We know nothing about it.	Ma nafu xejn dwarha.
What he couldn’t have.	Dik li ma setax ikollu.
This is always the case.	Hekk dejjem isir.
He speaks, and so he does.	Huwa jitkellem, u hekk hu.
Maybe it helps.	Forsi jgħin.
Each for himself.	Kull wieħed għalih.
I hope he is.	Nispera li hu.
But he was not playing.	Imma ma kienx jilgħab.
Everything was very difficult.	Kollox kien diffiċli ħafna.
It was here, it was there.	Kien hawn, kien hemm.
Like not even a little.	Bħal lanqas ftit.
Someone had to say something.	Xi ħadd kellu jgħid xi ħaġa.
But you know.	Imma taf.
He doesn’t have anything like that.	Huwa m'għandux xi ħaġa bħal din.
she will say.	se tgħid hi.
He is ready.	Huwa lest.
He doesn't know what to expect.	Ma jafx x’se jistenna.
She was eating.	Kienet tiekol.
I believe he wanted well.	Nemmen li ried tajjeb.
It's not entirely there.	Huwa mhux għal kollox hemm.
There were more people than there were.	Kien hemm aktar nies milli suppost kien hemm.
It wasn’t even his thing.	Hija lanqas ma kienet ħaġa tiegħu.
Not until this is done.	Mhux sakemm dan isir.
And they never did.	U qatt ma kienu jagħmlu.
He never leaves.	Hu qatt ma jitlaq.
And this happened often.	U dan ġara spiss.
It was quite beautiful.	Kienet pjuttost sabiħa.
Who you want to be.	Min trid tkun.
I should have known better.	I kellha tkun naf aħjar.
Obviously, everyone is trying to do that.	Ovvjament, kulħadd qed jipprova jagħmel dan.
It has never been so bad before.	Qatt ma kien daqshekk ħażin qabel.
It’s too much for me.	Huwa wisq għalija.
And so it was.	U hekk kien.
This can never happen here.	Dan qatt ma jista' jiġri hawn.
There was no one in the room with him.	Ma kien hemm ħadd fil-kamra miegħu.
It's not like that at all.	Mhu hekk xejn.
It can make my job easier or harder.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel xogħol tiegħi aktar faċli jew aktar diffiċli.
I don’t want to believe it.	Ma rridx nemmen.
Not a year probably.	Mhux sena probabbilment.
I was there.	Jien kont hemm.
Nothing was easier anymore.	Xejn ma kien faċli aktar.
I will make time.	Se nagħmel ħin.
Well, one can hope.	Ukoll, wieħed jista 'jittama.
I'm not anyone's problem.	Jien ma problema ta’ ħadd.
This is a lot.	Dan huwa ħafna.
He just says he’s not happy with you.	Jgħid biss li mhux kuntent miegħek.
Not very big.	Mhux kbir ħafna.
But it went well.	Imma mar tajjeb.
I want to see what he will say, if anything.	Irrid nara x'se jgħid, jekk xejn.
That's how they felt.	Hekk ħassu dan.
It was there all the time.	Kien hemm il-ħin kollu.
It's happening.	Qed jiġri.
No one ever thought they were sitting together.	Ħadd qatt ma kien jaħseb li kienu bilqiegħda flimkien.
Good, good for you.	Tajjeb, tajjeb għalik.
I don’t need anything else.	M'għandi bżonn xi ħaġa oħra.
It’s not even the last time.	Huwa lanqas l-aħħar darba.
I know it shouldn’t be like that.	Naf li m'għandux ikun hekk.
The first one easy.	L-ewwel wieħed faċli.
I have the same problem.	Għandi l-istess problema.
No, just too many years.	Le, ftit wisq snin.
I so didn’t want to do that.	Jien hekk ma ridtx nagħmel dan.
We can’t do enough.	Ma nistgħux nagħmlu biżżejjed.
I was alone.	Kont ġejt waħdek.
It happens almost every time.	Jiġri kważi kull darba.
But he had to wait a few years.	Imma kellu jistenna ftit snin.
I’m thinking about the same.	Qed naħseb dwar l-istess.
He never had a chance.	Qatt qatt ma kellu ċans.
He doesn’t want to find out.	Ma jridx isir jaf.
You need to know that it can be enough.	Trid tkun taf li tista’ tkun biżżejjed.
.	.
That was a lot of work.	Dan kien ħafna xogħol.
The problem is that he doesn’t know how.	Il-problema hi li ma jafx kif.
Do you have any idea ?.	Għandek xi idea?.
I want you to come home.	Irrid li tiġi d-dar.
I’ll get help, whatever you want.	Jien ser nieħu għajnuna, tkun xi tkun trid.
We want to do something about it.	Irridu nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwarha.
But you know it all.	Imma int taf dak kollu.
Who had a little something wrong with him.	Min kellu ftit xi ħaġa ħażina miegħu.
It would be better if they did nothing.	Ikun aħjar kieku ma kienu jagħmlu xejn.
There may never be.	Jista 'jkun hemm qatt.
It will make things easier for everyone.	Se tagħmel l-affarijiet aktar faċli għal kulħadd.
I think we did a pretty good job of that.	Naħseb li għamilna xogħol pjuttost tajjeb ta' dan.
Whatever you do, you know.	Dak kollu li tagħmel, taf.
We are doing what we can.	Aħna qed nagħmlu dak li nistgħu.
Obviously, he’s taking a chance now.	Ovvjament, issa qed jieħu ċans.
But when you actually do that, nothing happens.	Imma meta fil-fatt tagħmel dan, ma jiġri xejn.
Everything you ever eat.	Dak kollu li qatt tiekol.
It was made mine only when needed.	Kien isir tiegħi biss meta jkun hemm bżonn.
Work on this has already begun.	Ix-xogħol fuq dan diġà beda.
Or maybe it was him.	Jew forsi kien hu.
I’ve been able to do that.	Jien stajt nagħmel dan.
This is working well.	Dan qed jaħdem tajjeb.
He left behind me.	Huwa telaq wara lili.
But that's good.	Imma dak tajjeb.
And maybe it won't.	U forsi mhux se.
I hope yours is good to go.	Nittama li tiegħek huwa tajjeb biex tmur.
I was thinking all over.	Kont qed naħseb kollu.
That’s good enough for him.	Dak tajjeb biżżejjed għalih.
It doesn’t have to be that way.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
But even that wasn’t certain.	Imma lanqas dan ma kienx ċert.
That will come later.	Dak se jiġi aktar tard.
But it was not always so.	Imma mhux dejjem kien hekk.
But that doesn’t seem to be coming.	Imma dan ma jidhirx li ġej.
But not for long.	Imma mhux għal żmien twil.
No one knew.	Ħadd ma kien jaf.
How is that, you say ?.	Kif huwa dak, inti tgħid?.
No, none of that.	Le, xejn minn dan.
You can’t go wrong.	Ma tistax tmur ħażin.
probably.	probabbilment.
This book is for you.	Dan il-ktieb huwa għalik.
She just stays with us.	Hija biss toqgħod magħna.
But no one ever knew the truth.	Imma ħadd qatt ma kien ikun jaf il-verità.
I would like to eat something.	Nixtieq niekol xi ħaġa.
I can go back now and get more help.	Nista’ mmur lura issa u nieħu għajnuna oħra.
Everyone is glad to see each other.	Kulħadd huwa ferħan li jara lil xulxin.
He was here.	Huwa kien hawn.
I wait as long as you want me to wait.	Nistenna kemm trid li nistenna.
And no one else.	U ħadd ieħor.
She wants you to know this.	Hija trid li tkun taf dan.
He was making up for it.	Kien qed jagħmel tajjeb għal dan.
He was a great man there.	Kien raġel kbir hemmhekk.
This afternoon, actually.	Illum wara nofsinhar, fil-fatt.
It is working well now.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb issa.
But she didn't.	Imma hi ma.
I can't tell you.	Ma nistax ngħidlek.
He wants more money.	Irid aktar flus.
If he wanted to, he could.	Kieku ried, seta'.
You know it’s not going well.	Taf li mhux sejjer tajjeb.
You have a lot of time.	Għandek ħafna ħin.
I know you’re not like that.	Naf li int mhux hekk.
I didn't even know what to say about it.	Lanqas kont naf x’se ngħid dwarha.
He had a pretty good year.	Kellu sena pjuttost tajba.
He can talk happily for hours.	Jista’ jitkellem ferħan għal sigħat.
Maybe you look the same to other people.	Forsi inti tidher l-istess għal nies oħra.
I am very sorry about that.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna dwar dan.
You just need to know.	Jeħtieġ li tkun taf biss.
He was so scared.	Huwa kien tant jibża.
I go first.	Immur l-ewwel.
This is not all bad.	Dan mhux kollox ħażin.
You are no more.	M'intix aktar.
I already did.	Diġà għamilt.
He wanted nothing there.	Ma ried xejn hemmhekk.
I would like to see some of this.	Nixtieq li nara xi ftit minn dan.
Have you ever seen something like this ?.	Qatt rajt xi ħaġa bħal din?.
I think it would have been great.	Naħseb li kien ikun kbir.
You should be happy about it.	Għandek tkun kuntent dwar dan.
You are someone else.	Int xi ħadd ieħor.
Or so he thought.	Jew ħaseb li jista’.
Not much happens outside.	Mhux ħafna jiġri barra.
But not all bad either.	Imma mhux kollox ħażin lanqas.
All she did.	Dak kollu li għamlet.
And no one knew anyone.	U ħadd ma kien jaf lil ħadd.
Maybe you can tell me.	Forsi tista’ tgħidli.
Why? 	Għaliex?
Le, le u le.	Le, le u le.
I see that maybe it’s better here.	Nara li forsi hu aħjar hawn.
I know this may not be easy for you.	Naf li dan ma jistax ikun faċli għalik.
I wasn’t a friend.	Jien ma kontx ħabib.
That's hard.	Dak hu diffiċli.
I never thought it would be.	Qatt ma ħaseb li se jkun.
Not after what she did.	Mhux wara dak li għamlet.
One who died.	Wieħed li miet.
I wanted it out.	Jien ridt barra.
She was already back.	Kienet diġà lura.
It was still so early.	Kien għadu daqshekk kmieni.
Everything is ready to go.	Kollox lest biex imur.
Is this nothing supposed to be.	Huwa dan huwa xejn suppost.
It doesn’t look like anything happened.	Mhux qisu ġara xejn.
But maybe they should.	Imma forsi għandhom.
After that.	Wara dan .
You can see this happen.	Tista 'tara dan jiġri.
He sees that now.	Huwa jara li issa.
Maybe not always easy.	Forsi mhux dejjem faċli.
He had not seen it coming.	Ma kienx ra li ġej.
Pretty good, actually.	Pjuttost tajjeb, fil-fatt.
Your car was here.	Il-karozza tiegħek kienet hawn.
He is not one and will never be one.	Hu mhux wieħed u qatt mhu se jkun wieħed.
We’ve done this together before.	Dan għamilna flimkien qabel.
No more work.	Mhux aktar xogħol.
He said he couldn’t know.	Qal li ma setax jaf.
I’m being so good now.	Qed inkun daqshekk tajjeb issa.
There is no money at the moment.	M'hemm l-ebda flus bħalissa.
You don’t have to say it’s good.	M'għandekx għalfejn tgħid li hu tajjeb.
I wasn’t sure how to take this.	Ma kontx ċert kif nieħu dan.
There is always tomorrow.	Dejjem hemm għada.
Plus it’s easy.	Barra minn hekk huwa faċli.
There and there and there.	Hemm u hemm u hemm.
Maybe she'll come to you.	Forsi hi ser tiġi għandek.
This happens often.	Dan jiġri spiss.
Just what you want.	Biss dak li trid.
You are right, you are.	Għandek raġun, int.
But no one else knows.	Imma ħadd ieħor ma jaf.
He will survive now.	Issa se jgħix.
I still have a lot of friends there as well.	Għadni hemm ħafna ħbieb hemm ukoll.
That would be quite a problem.	Dik tkun pjuttost problema.
More than a few things.	Aktar minn ftit affarijiet.
Nothing will ever happen again.	Xejn qatt mhu se jerġa’ jerġa’ jkun daqshekk.
That’s what started it all.	Dak hu li beda dan kollu.
Probably noon or later.	Probabbilment nofsinhar jew aktar tard.
He found out about it just a few years ago.	Huwa sar jaf dwar dan biss ftit snin ilu.
It's not as small as it used to be.	M’huwiex żgħir daqs kemm kien.
The whole school.	L-iskola kollha.
Maybe that's just it.	Forsi hekk hu biss.
Time will tell who that is.	Iż-żmien jgħid min hu dak.
It should work properly now.	Għandu jaħdem kif suppost issa.
I’ll tell you more about it after you come back.	Ngħidlek aktar dwarha wara li tiġi lura.
We know where she is.	Nafu fejn hi.
Not good.	Mhux tajjeb.
She can do it wrong.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan ħażin.
I'm not even sure.	Jien lanqas ċert.
Neither are you.	Lanqas int.
I never did that.	Qatt ma għamilt dan.
Obviously not.	Ovvjament le.
It’s hard to tell what’s going on.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid x'inhu jiġri.
Whatever it was, it was too late now.	Tkun xi tkun, issa kien tard wisq.
I wonder what he wants.	Nistaqsi xi jrid.
But he knew all the time he was going.	Imma hu kien jaf il-ħin kollu li kien se.
He is doing something.	Qed jagħmel xi ħaġa.
And nothing too fast.	U xejn malajr wisq.
I was so happy.	Jien kont tant kuntent.
And a little will be difficult.	U xi ftit se jkun diffiċli.
Obviously they should.	Ovvjament għandhom.
I think everything.	Naħseb li kollox.
But it seems not.	Imma jidher li le.
It still doesn't and never will.	Għadu ma u qatt mhu se.
There is nothing more to say.	M'hemm xejn aktar xi ngħid.
Now we do a lot together.	Issa nagħmlu ħafna flimkien.
This can be a problem.	Dan jista 'jkun problema.
You have something great here.	Għandek xi ħaġa kbira hawn.
He was not happy.	Ma kienx kuntent.
I am trying to do so.	Qed nipprova nagħmel hekk.
No one here could tell what he was thinking.	Ħadd hawn ma seta’ jgħid x’kien qed jaħseb.
And soon another.	U dalwaqt ieħor.
Maybe it was better here.	Forsi kien aħjar hawn.
We may not.	Aħna forsi le.
I just need to know how it happens.	Għandi bżonn biss inkun naf kif jiġri.
It has always been so.	Dejjem kien hekk.
It just doesn’t happen.	Dan ma jiġri biss.
It can be as long as a year.	Jista 'jkun twil daqs sena.
And now we know why.	U issa nafu għaliex.
This was a good one.	Din kienet waħda tajba.
I think he’s there now.	Naħseb li qiegħed hemm issa.
Just not now.	Biss mhux issa.
I didn’t need to ask why.	Ma kellix bżonn nistaqsi għaliex.
I do this here.	Jien nagħmel dan hawn.
Of course, you knew what happened there.	Ovvjament, kont taf x’ġara hemmhekk.
I did.	Għamilt.
Who, why, how.	Min, għaliex, kif.
You have to think for both of us.	Trid taħseb għalina t-tnejn.
Not a man.	Mhux raġel.
No one usually was.	Ħadd normalment ma kien.
Definitely worth buying !.	Żgur li min jixtri!.
So says everyone.	Hekk jgħid kulħadd.
Too early.	Ħafna kmieni wisq.
Here's one.	Hawn wieħed.
There is nothing to see there.	M'hemm xejn x'tara hemmhekk.
It was not an easy job.	Ma kienx xogħol faċli.
Now it’s just tonight.	Issa hemm biss illejla.
Something was wrong, they felt sure.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina, ħassu ċert.
He couldn’t have had a better time.	Huwa ma setax ħin aħjar.
And you are mine.	U int tiegħi.
He said it could be.	Huwa qal li jista 'jkun.
This was not good.	Dan ma kienx tajjeb.
Tired, but definitely good.	Għajjien, imma żgur tajjeb.
It wasn’t easy for him.	Ma kienx faċli għalih.
He had done well.	Huwa kien għamel tajjeb.
It was his only chance.	Kien l-uniku ċans tiegħu.
Not now, of course.	Mhux issa, ovvjament.
She'll just say no.	Hija ser tgħid biss le.
I didn’t really see it.	Ma tantx rajt.
I wonder who it might be.	Nistaqsi min jista’ jkun.
Maybe he’s really there.	Forsi hu verament qiegħed hemm.
That was something she was doing.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa li kienet tagħmel.
I always try to please.	Dejjem nipprova jekk jogħġbok.
Who can speak.	Min jista’ jitkellem.
Everyone has always said so.	Kulħadd dejjem qal hekk.
He was playing.	Kien qed jilgħab.
From now until forever.	Minn issa sa dejjem.
He told me it was good.	Huwa qalli li kien tajjeb.
Not bad.	Mhux ħażin.
He is happy here and wants to stay.	Huwa kuntent hawn u jrid jibqa’.
That may never work.	Li qatt ma jista 'jaħdem.
It has to be.	Irid ikun.
You are really doing a good job.	Int tassew qed tagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
I was just a kid.	Kont biss tifel.
You have your truth too.	Għandek il-verità tiegħek ukoll.
We knew it was time to go.	Konna nafu li wasal iż-żmien li mmorru.
They weren't there much.	Huma ma kienx hemm ħafna.
It's his.	Huwa tiegħu.
It never will be.	Hija qatt ma tkun.
If there was anyone else.	Jekk kien hemm xi ħadd ieħor.
The work is not.	Ix-xogħol mhuwiex.
I don’t want to say.	Ma rridx ngħid.
No, it takes too long.	Le, dan jieħu wisq żmien.
And it had to be.	U kellu jkun.
He only needed one to work.	Huwa kellu bżonn wieħed biss biex jaħdem.
Everyone was fine.	Kulħadd kien tajjeb.
He didn’t want to talk about it.	Ma riedx jitkellem dwar dan.
Not yet, and maybe never.	Għadu mhux, u forsi qatt.
She was on to something.	Hija kienet fuq xi ħaġa.
I have to tell you tonight.	Għandi ngħidlek illejla.
You will be there.	Int tkun hemm.
No one had come for us.	Ħadd ma kien ġie għalina.
I always do.	Jien dejjem nagħmel.
And there it was.	U kien hemm,.
Nothing was ever good enough.	Xejn qatt ma kien tajjeb biżżejjed.
I just listen.	Jien biss nisma.
It comes later.	Jiġi aktar tard.
Do whatever.	Tagħmel xi tkun.
You can only do what you can do.	Tista 'tagħmel biss dak li tista' tagħmel.
I'm just tired.	Jien biss għajjien.
She was right and she knew it.	Kellu raġun u hi kienet taf.
It's not something we've been through.	Mhux xi ħaġa li konna ma’ xulxin.
Maybe it was yesterday.	Forsi kien ilbieraħ.
Chance is what he wanted.	Ċans huwa dak li ried.
I did a pretty good job.	Għamilt xogħol pjuttost tajjeb.
You can tell me tomorrow.	Tista' tgħidli għada.
I think this is a great way.	Naħseb li dan huwa mod tajjeb ħafna.
I’m not sure why this happens.	M'inix ċert għaliex jiġri dan.
I want it now.	Irrid issa.
You will come now.	Inti se tiġi issa.
It was late in the evening.	Kien tard filgħaxija.
It will do so.	Se tagħmel hekk.
I buy that.	Nixtri dak.
There was something more.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa aktar.
As always, I do.	Bħal dejjem, jien.
I don’t take anything.	Jien ma nieħu xejn.
This has happened a lot.	Dan ġara ħafna.
That would be wrong.	Dan ikun ħażin.
I need to talk to you about something else.	Għandi bżonn nitkellem miegħek dwar xi ħaġa oħra.
No, we are not.	Le, aħna le.
Only that was work.	Biss li kien xogħol.
He was good to me.	Kien tajjeb miegħi.
Maybe a long time ago.	Forsi twil ilu.
This week it will go again.	Din il-ġimgħa se jerġa' jmur.
I don’t know why one would expect anything else.	Ma nafx għaliex wieħed jistenna xi ħaġa oħra.
We always did.	Dejjem għamilna.
He did well.	Huwa għamel tajjeb.
And much more.	U ħafna aktar.
He was a small man.	Kien raġel żgħir.
I don’t have to think about it.	M'għandix għalfejn naħseb dwarha.
I didn’t want to go there.	Ma ridtx immur hemm.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Jiddispjaċini li qed nisma 'din.
I want help.	Irrid għajnuna.
Everything is working fine.	Kollox qed jaħdem tajjeb.
I hadn’t thought much of it.	Ma kontx ħsibt ħafna.
In fact, no one was really sure.	Fil-fatt, ħadd ma kien verament ċert.
The truth, all that.	Il-verità, dak kollu.
I'm going.	Jien sejjer.
She had to know better.	Hija kellha tkun taf aħjar.
Let’s do this again.	Ejja nagħmlu dan mill-ġdid.
I was so scared.	Jien kont nibża’ daqshekk.
I was tired now.	Kont għajjien issa.
We had a lot of these.	Kellna ħafna minn dawn.
As soon as you can.	Kemm tista’ malajr.
Tell everyone you can think this is happening.	Għid lil kulħadd li tista' taħseb li dan qed jiġri.
But only a few.	Imma ftit biss.
That was before.	Dak kien qabel.
I was just a kid.	Kont tifel biss.
I went too far.	Jien mort wisq.
Everyone had gone home.	Kulħadd kien mar id-dar.
And that’s great to know.	U dan huwa tajjeb ħafna li tkun taf.
Maybe this helps.	Forsi dan jgħin.
I want to go.	Irrid immur.
Well it’s the same thing.	Ukoll hija l-istess ħaġa.
I didn’t know anything about it until later.	Ma kont naf xejn dwarha sa aktar tard.
Nothing can ever be the same again.	Xejn qatt ma jista’ jerġa’ jerġa’ jkun l-istess.
But something else, too.	Imma xi ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
There are a lot of people.	Hemm ħafna nies.
It could be another.	Jista’ jiġi ieħor.
But we can do something about it.	Imma nistgħu nagħmlu xi ħaġa dwar dan.
Come on, you’re better than this.	Ejja, int aħjar minn dan.
Everything eats something else.	Kollox jiekol xi ħaġa oħra.
But it wasn’t going to be easy.	Imma ma kienx se jkun faċli.
She didn’t know any better.	Ma kinitx taf aħjar.
It was a few hours in the afternoon.	Kien ftit sigħat wara nofsinhar.
He would never tell anyone.	Qatt ma kien jgħid lil ħadd.
But there is nothing you can really do.	Imma m'hemm xejn li tista 'verament tagħmel.
I really don’t know anymore.	Verament ma nafx aktar.
Maybe for him, he.	Forsi għalih, hu.
No one knew in advance.	Ħadd ma kien jaf minn qabel.
I love this.	Qed inħobb dan.
And no one did anything.	U ħadd ma għamel xejn.
Well, we can for a while.	Ukoll, nistgħu għal xi żmien.
That came from there.	Dan ġie minn hemm.
You knew it was going to be there, of course.	Kont taf li kien se jkun hemm, ovvjament.
What will come, will come.	Dak li se jiġi, se jiġi.
No one can know for sure.	Ħadd ma jista’ jkun jaf żgur.
But it is not working well.	Imma mhux qed jaħdem tajjeb.
This is a great thing for me.	Din hija ħaġa kbira għalija.
And you saw my resume.	U inti rajt jerġa tiegħi.
It doesn’t make anyone happier.	Ma jagħmel lil ħadd aktar ferħan.
That’s what I did.	Dik kienet għamilt jien.
Everyone seems happy.	Kulħadd jidher kuntent.
Everyone was scared.	Kulħadd kien jibża.
It was good to be home.	Kien tajjeb li tkun id-dar.
That's just it.	Hekk hu biss.
I don’t think we do.	Ma naħsibx li nagħmlu.
Until you go.	Sa tmur.
And you just know.	U taf biss.
But it’s not happening.	Imma mhux qed jiġri.
He had seen it happen.	Huwa kien ra jiġri.
We can be us again.	Nistgħu nkunu aħna mill-ġdid.
He made sure of that.	Huwa għamel ċert minn dan.
That’s good and good.	Dak tajjeb u tajjeb.
Well, she had done it.	Ukoll, hija kienet għamlet dan.
It’s more than it looks.	Huwa aktar minn dak li jidher.
That's not so.	Dak mhux hekk.
Many, few people do.	Ħafna, ftit nies jagħmlu.
And we will.	U aħna se.
We have to do things, but we can’t.	Irridu nagħmlu l-affarijiet, imma ma nistgħux.
He couldn’t help but think something was wrong.	Ma setax ma jaħseb li xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
It seems like a chance like this.	Jidher ċans bħal dan.
She was no longer a person.	Ma kinitx aktar persuna.
Everyone was playing.	Kull min kien jilgħab.
This may really not be easy for you.	Dan jista 'verament ma jkunx faċli għalik.
He couldn’t be talking about the same boy.	Ma setax qed jitkellem dwar l-istess tifel.
Nor were they in school now.	U lanqas kienu l-iskola issa.
But not here and not now.	Imma mhux hawn u mhux issa.
You make a lot more money.	Inti tagħmel ħafna aktar flus.
How beautiful she was.	Kemm kienet sabiħa.
He really was there.	Huwa verament kien hemm.
But that’s what it says.	Imma huwa dak li jgħid.
But he thought he did.	Imma ħaseb li għamel.
But it seemed so to me many times.	Imma hekk deher lili ħafna drabi.
Really, really.	Tassew, tassew.
We don't.	M'għandniex .
She is very beautiful.	Hija sabiħa ħafna.
It's good that he is.	Huwa tajjeb li hu.
He will be here soon.	Huwa ser ikun hawn dalwaqt.
It's for us.	Huwa għalina.
I know nothing.	Jien ma naf xejn.
Not for long.	Mhux għal żmien twil.
Everyone came to me.	Kulħadd ġie għandi.
Look out with me.	Ħares barra miegħi.
When you think, not forever.	Meta taħseb, mhux għal dejjem.
Just that I did.	Biss li għamilt.
But it really was more like this.	Imma verament kien aktar bħal dan.
Just a few hours.	Ftit sigħat biss.
He could stay there forever and be very happy.	Huwa seta’ joqgħod hemm għal dejjem ferħan ħafna.
I go home.	Immur id-dar.
Never, or almost never.	Qatt, jew kważi qatt.
She knew that now.	Hija kienet taf li issa.
Good job too.	Xogħol tajjeb ukoll.
They have more than one job.	Għandhom aktar minn xogħol wieħed.
For me, all is well.	Għalija, kollox tajjeb.
I couldn’t tell why.	Ma stajtx tgħid għaliex.
It seems easy enough.	Jidher faċli biżżejjed.
It doesn’t seem to work for me.	Ma jidhirx li jaħdem għalija.
It's working and up.	Qed jaħdem u sa.
If he has one, he thought.	Jekk ikollu wieħed, ħaseb.
It was really bad.	Kien tassew ħażin.
It's just not what they were about.	Huwa biss mhux dak li kienu dwar.
I don’t want to do that.	Ma rridx li nagħmel hekk.
This is obviously very very wrong.	Dan huwa ovvjament ħażin ħafna ħafna.
I knew that every man could do this to me.	Kont naf li kull raġel jista’ jagħmel dan miegħi.
As he does.	Kif jagħmel hu.
As they were now.	Kif kienu issa.
That’s not a bad thing !.	Dik mhix xi ħaġa ħażina!.
And he knew everything about everything.	U kien jaf kollox dwar kollox.
Or my dog.	Jew il-kelb tiegħi.
That was what it was.	Kien dak li kien.
It makes you want to go there.	Jagħmel trid tmur hemm.
I didn’t always do that.	Mhux dejjem għamilt hekk.
Easy enough for you to tell.	Faċli biżżejjed għalik biex tgħid.
I'm going to need some help here.	Jien ser ikolli bżonn xi għajnuna hawn.
He knew what it was.	Kieku kien jaf x’kien.
You want to know about it.	Int trid tkun taf dwarha.
I think he needs some time.	Naħseb li għandu bżonn ftit ħin.
I can't do it again.	Ma nistax nerġa' nagħmel.
Go on to something else.	Tmur fuq xi ħaġa oħra.
I am asking one thing.	Qed nistaqsi ħaġa waħda.
That was too late.	Dan kien tard wisq.
This seemed like a good time to go.	Dan deher żmien tajjeb biex sejjer.
You can't do wrong.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel ħażin.
None of these happened.	L-ebda wieħed minn dawn ma ġara.
I had had enough of this.	Kelli biżżejjed minn dan.
Am I me? 	Jien jien?
You don’t even know how it happened.	Lanqas taf kif ġara.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
I would be happy with that.	Inkun kuntent b'dan.
If she is there.	Jekk hi hemm.
In fact, he had never done that.	Fil-fatt, qatt ma kien għamel dan.
I love being there.	Inħobb inkun hemmhekk.
I am very happy to hear this.	Jien kuntent ħafna li nisma' dan.
But this could not be.	Imma dan ma setax ikun.
This is too small to fit.	Dan huwa żgħir wisq biex joqgħod.
But he can't do it.	Imma ma jistax jagħmel.
He is ready to speak.	Huwa lest li jitkellem.
I would be a better man.	Inkun raġel aħjar.
Not often enough.	Mhux ta’ spiss biżżejjed.
I'll think about it.	Jien ser naħseb dwarha.
That could be a good thing or a bad thing.	Dik tista’ tkun xi ħaġa tajba jew ħażina.
My dog, he’s great.	Il-kelb tiegħi, huwa kbir.
Maybe you can't talk.	Forsi ma tistax titkellem.
I like that too.	Jien inħobb dik ukoll.
Or, better yet, both.	Jew, aħjar, it-tnejn.
And we do more than that.	U nagħmlu aktar minn dan.
Everything took a lot of work.	Kollox ħa ħafna xogħol.
It should be soon.	Għandu jkun dalwaqt.
You want to know how.	Trid tkun taf kif.
That’s not your job.	Dak mhux ix-xogħol tiegħek.
This takes a lot of time.	Dan jieħu ħafna ħin.
He was right, of course.	Huwa kellu raġun, ovvjament.
He is all alone.	Huwa kollu waħdu.
It’s the same thing he said.	Huwa l-istess ħaġa li qal.
Or just one.	Jew wieħed biss.
He just told the truth.	Huwa biss qal il-verità.
It may not be there.	Jista 'ma jkunx hemm.
This was not how they were.	Dan ma kienx kif kienu.
As well as some other people.	Kif ukoll xi nies oħra.
It was pretty small when it all happened.	Kien pjuttost żgħir meta ġara dan kollu.
That was for sure now.	Dan kien ċert issa.
That was about a year ago.	Dan kien madwar sena ilu.
But he had done everything wrong.	Imma kien għamel kollox ħażin.
Maybe nothing.	Forsi xejn.
And, better yet, he knows how to get there.	U, aħjar, jaf kif jasal hemm.
Maybe it happened around this time.	Forsi ġara madwar dan iż-żmien.
Just back.	Eżatt lura.
Only one gets better.	Kull wieħed biss isir aħjar.
I can try again.	Nista' nerġa' nipprova.
He had to go outside.	Kellu jmur barra.
And it's good that way.	U huwa tajjeb hekk.
We are all on the same now.	Aħna kollha fuq l-istess issa.
He came with me.	Ġie miegħi.
I do a lot to say no.	Nagħmel ħafna ngħid le.
It works well, everything works well.	Jaħdem tajjeb, kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
None of this has ever been yours.	Xejn minn dan qatt ma kien tiegħek.
I was surprised.	Jien kont sorpriż.
That’s not a good way to go.	Dak mhux mod tajjeb biex tmur.
He was also, after all, his friend.	Kien ukoll, wara xi mod, ħabib tiegħu.
I’ve always been here.	Jien dejjem kont hawn.
It’s only been the last few years.	Għadu l-aħħar ftit snin.
That’s pretty much what it is.	Dak huwa pjuttost dak li hu.
You go, now.	Inti tmur, issa.
I like to know better.	Inħobb inkun naf aħjar.
Not even today.	Lanqas illum.
And lately she has always been tired of school.	U dan l-aħħar kienet dejjem għajjien l-iskola.
It says nothing.	Ma jgħid xejn.
I know a lot of things.	Naf ħafna affarijiet.
And he would survive this and more.	U kien se jgħix dan u aktar.
Something good would be good.	Xi ħaġa tajba tkun tajba.
I never really know.	Jien qatt ma naf verament.
But no, we are.	Imma le, aħna.
That was something.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa.
This is the first.	Dan huwa l-ewwel.
But nothing gave.	Imma xejn ma ta.
It can make you see things.	Hija tista 'tagħmel inti tara l-affarijiet.
I don't know how.	Ma nafx kif jista’ jkun.
But just about everyone is.	Imma biss dwar kulħadd huwa.
Now you are talking.	Issa qed titkellem.
Someone is likely to be there soon.	Xi ħadd x'aktarx ikun hemm dalwaqt.
He was leaving to go to work.	Kien jitlaq biex imur ix-xogħol.
Something for everyone.	Xi ħaġa għal kulħadd.
It is not yours.	Hija mhix tiegħek.
It was there.	Kien hemm.
I probably don’t think anyone is good enough for me.	Probabbilment ma jaħsibx li xi ħadd hu tajjeb biżżejjed għalija.
Many people were unemployed.	Ħafna nies kienu bla xogħol.
I want to do this.	Irrid nagħmel dan.
It's back to me.	Huwa lura għandi.
We have to do both.	Irridu nagħmlu t-tnejn.
But it was time to go.	Imma kien wasal iż-żmien li mmorru.
It seems to work.	Jidher li jaħdem.
Not a bad one, really.	Mhux waħda ħażina, tassew.
I'll believe you.	Jien ser nemmen inti.
We can go on when the time comes.	Nistgħu mmorru fuq meta jasal iż-żmien.
I didn’t even see it coming.	Lanqas ma rajt li ġej.
It’s his thing, our thing.	Hija ħaġa tiegħu, ħaġa tagħna.
It was really easy actually.	Kien verament faċli fil-fatt.
That could be the case at times.	Hekk seta’ jkun xi drabi.
She seemed to know the house.	Jidher li kienet taf id-dar.
I thought the two were the same.	Ħsibt li t-tnejn kienu l-istess.
This was only a year.	Din kienet biss sena.
He was one, after all.	Huwa kien wieħed, wara kollox.
There is no way.	M'hemm l-ebda mod.
He took everything wrong.	Huwa ħa kollox ħażin.
No one and nothing was there.	Ħadd u xejn ma kien hemm.
He thinks this is a good idea.	Jaħseb li din hija idea tajba.
There is a lot to see and do.	Hemm ħafna x'tara u tagħmel.
And that's it.	U huwa dak.
We should be back already.	Għandna nkunu lura diġà.
Not that it was any good.	Mhux li kienet xi tajba.
You can't make more time.	Ma tistax tagħmel aktar ħin.
But that’s what it is.	Imma huwa dak li hu.
If you want.	Jekk trid.
That's a quick job.	Dak hu xogħol ta’ malajr.
He was a problem.	Huwa kien problema.
But that doesn’t hurt.	Imma dan ma jagħmilx ħażin.
Obviously it was really great.	Ovvjament kien tassew kbir.
He would never have had a better chance.	Hu qatt ma kien ikollu ċans aħjar.
I’m willing to believe everything you say.	Jien lest nemmen dak kollu li tgħid.
This may be your problem.	Din tista' tkun il-problema tiegħek.
She wants to know where he was.	Hija trid tkun taf fejn kien.
I only happen once.	I jiġri darba biss.
But it seemed so.	Imma kien jidher hekk.
No one can help now.	Ħadd ma jista’ jgħin issa.
All this time no one had said anything.	Dan il-ħin kollu ħadd ma kien qal xejn.
But it wasn’t something to eat.	Imma ma kinitx xi ħaġa li tiekol.
It's this one.	Huwa dan wieħed.
But it wasn’t enough.	Imma ma kienx biżżejjed.
And he would have.	U kien ikollu.
I can’t think about all this now.	Ma nistax naħseb dwar dan kollu issa.
You were helpful.	Int kont ta’ għajnuna.
I’m sorry it seems to have gone wrong.	Jiddispjaċini li jidher li ħareġ ħażin.
Something is there.	Xi ħaġa hemm.
He doesn’t want anything else.	Ma jridx xi ħaġa oħra.
The same way I did.	L-istess mod kif għamilt.
In fact she did no such thing.	Fil-fatt hija ma għamlet l-ebda ħaġa bħal din.
It was good too.	Kien tajjeb ukoll.
It's a good thing.	Hija ħaġa tajba.
It's much better.	Huwa ħafna aħjar.
There is nothing more.	M'hemm xejn aktar.
It's better than before.	Huwa aħjar minn qabel.
Much more my thing.	Wisq aktar ħaġa tiegħi.
He was always with us.	Kien dejjem magħna.
He would come again and again.	Kien jerġa’ jiġi u spiss.
Everyone was so surprised.	Kulħadd kien tant sorpriż.
No child can.	L-ebda tifel ma jista’.
Since then I have not been back.	Minn dak iż-żmien ma kellix lura.
I do something like that.	Nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din.
I haven’t seen anything yet.	Għadek ma rajt xejn.
That’s what it does.	Dak hu li tagħmel dan.
In fact, everyone should be here soon.	Fil-fatt, kulħadd għandu jkun hawn dalwaqt.
And now not.	U issa mhux.
Always be yours.	Dejjem tkun tiegħek.
It has just passed.	Għadu kemm għadda.
I had to understand something.	Kelli nifhem xi ħaġa.
He is not sure how to take this.	Huwa mhux ċert kif jieħu dan.
They are just people.	Huma biss nies.
Definitely one for you.	Żgur waħda għalik.
It will be your last.	Ikun l-aħħar tiegħek.
And more and more.	U aktar u aktar.
He is alone.	Huwa waħdu.
You are at work.	Inti fuq ix-xogħol.
I want to go back to school.	Irrid lura l-iskola.
Let me see.	Ħa nara .
You may never see this happen.	Tista 'qatt tara dan jiġri.
He just has you.	Huwa biss għandu inti.
I can’t wait for that.	Ma nistax nistenna għal dan.
This is both good and bad for you.	Dan huwa kemm tajjeb kif ukoll ħażin għalik.
Well, it seems like maybe he wasn’t the only one.	Ukoll, jidher li forsi ma kienx l-uniku wieħed.
He entered the room.	Huwa daħal fil-kamra.
She did nothing.	Hija ma għamlet xejn.
He was still playing.	Kien għadu jilgħab.
This is all working well.	Dan kollu qed jaħdem tajjeb.
Now here they were.	Issa hawn kienu.
It's easy now.	Huwa faċli issa.
But it was early afternoon.	Imma kien kmieni wara nofsinhar.
I wish she had done nothing.	Nixtieq li ma għamlet xejn.
He really has to.	Huwa verament għandu.
Not too big, not too small.	Mhux kbir wisq, mhux żgħir wisq.
Let's go home.	Ejja mmorru d-dar.
Just a little more.	Biss ftit aktar.
Maybe it was time.	Forsi kien iż-żmien.
It may be a little.	Jista 'jkun ftit.
I wasn’t a good man.	Jien ma kontx raġel tajjeb.
I can’t believe you come here alone.	Ma nistax nemmen li tiġi hawn waħdek.
I don’t want to say a bit either.	Ma rridx ngħid xi ftit lanqas.
It looks bad.	Jidher ħażin.
Like you see that.	Bħal tara dak.
A child was to be expected.	Tifel kien ta’ min jistenna.
Each easy.	Kull wieħed faċli.
I had that before.	Kelli dak qabel.
Maybe they were.	Forsi kienu.
But she knew.	Imma hi kienet taf.
That was more.	Dan kien aktar.
That was wrong too.	Dak kien ħażin ukoll.
I know you’re there.	Naf li int hemmhekk.
The timing is good.	Il-ħin huwa tajjeb.
He asked not to be too long.	Huwa talab li ma jkunx twil wisq.
I love everything.	Inħobb kollox.
All on your own.	Kollha waħdek.
What happened, happened.	Dak li ġara, ġara.
For one thing, everyone was having a good time too.	Minn ħaġa waħda, kulħadd kien qed jieħu ħin tajjeb wisq.
Try not to do that.	Ipprova ma tagħmilx hekk.
We are what we are, and you are too.	Aħna dak li aħna, u int ukoll.
It still looks good.	Għadha tidher tajba.
You don't talk about anything.	Inti ma titkellem dwar xejn.
It's the only way.	Huwa l-uniku mod.
I'll tell you about that later.	I ser ngħidlek dwar dan aktar tard.
No one else so.	Ħadd aktar hekk.
You can do whatever you want to do.	Tista 'tagħmel dak kollu li trid tagħmel.
No one is scared now.	Ħadd ma jibża issa.
More soon.	Aktar dalwaqt.
A little at a time.	Ftit kull darba.
That was just yesterday.	Dan kien biss il-bieraħ.
I do the same with him.	Jien nagħmel l-istess miegħu.
I never said.	Qatt ma għedt.
They do a lot.	Huma jagħmlu ħafna.
There had to be some way out of this.	Kellu jkun hemm xi mod minn dan.
No one ever said they saw this happen.	Ħadd qatt ma qal li ra dan jiġri.
More than it was.	Aktar milli kien.
That was a lot for me.	Dak kien ħafna għalija.
He knows where he wants to go.	Jaf fejn irid jasal.
It seems I can’t understand the following.	Jidher li ma nistax nifhem dan li ġej.
Come here I have, he said.	Ejja hawn għandi, qal.
Well one didn’t.	Ukoll wieħed ma kellux.
Time has passed.	Iż-żmien għadda.
And everyone thought it was long.	U kulħadd ħaseb li kien twil.
There wasn’t much to see.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna x'tara.
I was a little surprised but happy.	Kont xi ftit sorpriż imma kuntent.
It's getting late.	Qed isir tard.
You do it, you said.	Inti tagħmel dan, inti qal.
I can’t do something like that.	Ma nistax nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din.
Not for me.	Mhux għalija.
He wanted it to happen.	Ried li jiġri.
He couldn't either.	Lanqas seta’.
Something was wrong.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
Like never before.	Bħal qatt qatt.
You can’t tell anyone.	Ma tistax tgħid lil ħadd.
Everything works fine.	Kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
It was really, really great.	Kien tassew, tassew kbir.
And someone needed help.	U xi ħadd kellu bżonn l-għajnuna.
He would be a good man to work for.	Ikun raġel tajjeb biex jaħdem għalih.
He seems like a good man to have around.	Jidher raġel tajjeb li jkollu madwar.
In fact, it comes.	Fil-fatt, ġej.
Maybe it came too late or, too early.	Forsi wasal tard wisq jew, kmieni wisq.
He seemed to want the same thing.	Deher li ried l-istess ħaġa.
Usually, this seems to be a bad thing.	Normalment, din tidher li tkun xi ħaġa ħażina.
I knew there was going to be more.	Kont naf li kien se jkun hemm aktar.
Better late than never.	Aħjar aktar tard milli qatt.
Just didn’t look good.	Biss ma deherx tajjeb.
I will have to go back there some time soon.	Ikolli mmur lura hemm xi żmien dalwaqt.
The same was it.	L-istess kien.
That would be one thing.	Dik tkun ħaġa waħda.
He wanted more.	Ried aktar.
A very long time passed.	Għadda żmien twil ħafna.
Now don’t do that.	Issa ma jagħmilx hekk.
I do everything.	Nagħmel dak kollu.
Like around the house.	Bħal madwar id-dar.
He is still a happy boy.	Għadu tifel ferħan.
It’s exactly the same thing, but whatever.	Hija eżatt l-istess ħaġa, imma tkun xi tkun.
His great friend.	Ħabib kbir tiegħu.
Nothing ever happened.	Qatt ma ġara xejn.
She was doing so.	Hija kienet tagħmel hekk.
We both knew it.	It-tnejn konna nafu.
I'm not listening.	Jien mhux nisma.
Maybe he had missed something.	Forsi kien tilef xi ħaġa.
It is supposed to be for me.	Suppost li jkun għalija.
I'll wait.	Jien ser nistenna.
It doesn’t seem to have been enough.	Ma jidhirx li kien biżżejjed.
You are nothing.	M'intix xejn.
I never thought so.	Qatt ma kont ħsibt hekk.
He knew it had to happen.	Kien jaf li kellu jiġri.
And, really, you’ve done better.	U, tassew, inti stajt għamilt aħjar.
That's very good.	Dak tajjeb ħafna.
I had no idea how to do it again.	Ma kelli l-ebda idea kif nerġa’ nerġa’ nagħmel.
He bought his.	Huwa xtara tiegħu.
That was that.	Dak kien dak.
But it has me.	Imma għandu lili.
What is yours ?.	X'inhu tiegħek?.
No one talks to him.	Ħadd ma jitkellem miegħu.
That was because there wasn’t one.	Dan kien għaliex ma kienx hemm waħda.
Never as much as that time.	Qatt daqs dak iż-żmien.
Everyone can and should and wants to.	Kulħadd jista’ u għandu u jrid.
It was a problem.	Kien problema.
She would come back from wherever she was.	Hija kienet tiġi lura minn kull fejn kienet.
Obviously we never know.	Ovvjament qatt ma nafu.
But of course, it doesn’t always work that way.	Imma ovvjament, mhux dejjem jaħdem hekk.
I thought it wasn’t a good idea.	Ħsibt li mhux idea tajba.
To be sure, not always.	Biex tkun ċert, mhux dejjem.
Only he will be back by now until.	Biss hu jkun lura sa issa sakemm .
This is how.	Dan huwa kif.
He is not doing so.	Huwa mhux qed jagħmel hekk.
He is still working on the same problem.	Għadu qed jaħdem fuq l-istess problema.
She can't do that.	Hija ma tistax tagħmel dan.
It will be good.	Se jkun tajjeb.
He will never be the same man again.	Qatt ma jerġa’ jkun l-istess raġel.
Which obviously wasn’t going to work.	Li ovvjament ma kienx se jaħdem.
No one ever talks about it.	Ħadd qatt ma jitkellem dwarha.
She must be so scared.	Hija trid tkun tant jibża.
He didn’t have to wait long.	Ma kellux għalfejn jistenna ħafna.
If you want to go that far.	Jekk trid tmur daqshekk.
Well, he thinks he can.	Ukoll, huwa jaħseb li jista '.
We will do both.	Se nagħmlu t-tnejn.
Many things.	Ħafna affarijiet.
There were too many.	Kien hemm wisq.
There was nowhere to go, nothing could be done.	Ma kien hemm fejn imur, xejn ma seta’ jagħmel.
I’m really into it.	Jien tassew għalih.
They are very easy.	Huma faċli ħafna.
You know, I wasn’t eating much.	Taf, ma kinitx qed tiekol ħafna.
So far.	Sa hawn.
She had to do this often.	Hija kellha tagħmel dan spiss.
He has to do it alone.	Irid jagħmel dan waħdu.
It seems to be the last, too.	Jidher li huwa l-aħħar, ukoll.
I know only a few.	Naf ftit biss.
I am sure many other people do.	Jiena ċert li ħafna nies oħra jagħmlu dan.
We know better now, and we knew it then.	Nafu aħjar issa, u konna nafu dak iż-żmien.
You can't be sure.	Ma tistax tkun ċert.
It looked like.	Deher qisu .
That was, of course.	Dak kien, ovvjament.
It was nothing like this.	Ma kien xejn bħal dan.
But here’s a lot more.	Imma hawn ħafna aktar.
She does more.	Hija tagħmel aktar.
If you happen to be one of these.	Jekk jiġri li tkun wieħed minn dawn.
So many people.	Tant nies.
And another year.	U sena oħra.
They won't.	Huma mhux se.
But we have time for this later.	Imma għandna ħin għal dan aktar tard.
I still think he can do it.	Għadni naħseb li jista’ jagħmel dan.
I thought maybe you’d like to go with me.	Ħsibt li forsi tixtieq tmur miegħi.
That was me.	Dak kont jien.
He never had a chance to take anything back.	Qatt ma kellu ċans jieħu xi ħaġa lura.
It was, for a time.	Kien, għal żmien.
Definitely worth a try.	Żgur ikun ta’ min jipprova.
He was.	Huwa kien .
He had never seen these before.	Hu qatt ma kien ra dawn qabel.
He should be fine.	Huwa għandu jkun tajjeb.
I thought you knew.	Ħsibt li taf.
It was just a little too late.	Kien biss ftit tard wisq.
This is what.	Dan huwa dak.
I’m afraid he wants to come with me now.	Nibża li issa trid tiġi miegħi.
I could tell he didn't know what to say.	Stajt ngħid li ma kienx jaf x’se jgħid.
Not a very good one.	Mhix waħda tajba ħafna.
He did not know what it would look like.	Ma kienx jaf kif se tidher.
He was playing with me.	Kien jilgħab miegħi.
I’m glad we did.	Jien kuntent li għamilna.
I have enough problems.	Jien ikolli biżżejjed problemi.
I talk about other things.	Nitkellem dwar affarijiet oħra.
That was then, this now.	Dak kien dak iż-żmien, dan issa.
It often was.	Ħafna drabi kien.
I was right the first time.	Kelli raġun l-ewwel darba.
It’s for everyone, or it’s nothing.	Huwa għal kulħadd, jew mhu xejn.
Actually not me.	Fil-fatt mhux jien.
But everything works.	Imma kollox jaħdem.
And you can be sure that he will try.	U tista’ tkun ċert li se jipprova.
John has none of that.	John ma jkollu xejn minn hekk.
Very little came back to me.	Ftit li xejn ġie lura lili.
I definitely don’t want that.	Żgur li ma rridx hekk.
This is the first.	Dan huwa l-ewwel.
They do so, but not only that.	Jagħmlu hekk, imma mhux hekk biss.
She was three years old.	Kellha tliet snin.
And, in fact, it was.	U, fil-fatt, kien.
Now he knew everything.	Issa kien jaf kollox.
Someone did all of these things.	Xi ħadd għamel kull waħda minn dawn l-affarijiet.
As it were.	Kif kieku hi.
A little time alone.	Ftit ħin waħdu.
Nothing too big.	Xejn kbir wisq.
No one said anything.	Ħadd ma qal xejn.
I didn’t know why.	Ma kontx naf għaliex.
It’s time to do another.	Wasal iż-żmien li tagħmel ieħor.
It's just better to be good.	Huwa biss aħjar tkun tajba.
We really did.	Aħna verament għamilna.
Now he did.	Issa għamel.
She was always going to be there.	Kienet dejjem se tkun hemm.
He had had enough.	Huwa kellu biżżejjed.
Nothing for you with you.	Xejn għalik miegħek.
If there are any.	Jekk hemm xi.
I want to know beforehand.	Irrid inkun naf qabel.
I don’t know for sure.	Ma nafx żgur.
But he never did.	Imma qatt ma għamel.
Or so he said.	Jew hekk qal.
But she is not always.	Imma hi mhux dejjem.
He didn't want to.	Ma riedx.
Year after year.	Sena wara sena.
This is the one for me.	Din hija dik għalija.
But just me.	Imma jien biss.
I don’t know where.	Ma nafx fejn.
Tell everyone.	Tgħid lil kulħadd.
He was going to say something.	Kien se jgħid xi ħaġa.
But she knew enough.	Imma hi kienet taf biżżejjed.
Always try to say something.	Dejjem ipprova tgħid xi ħaġa.
This he told me many times.	Dan qalli ħafna drabi.
He should say and do nothing.	Għandu jgħid u ma jagħmel xejn.
For me, that’s a problem.	Għalija, dik hija problema.
There is no.	M'hemm l-ebda.
This needs to happen.	Dan jeħtieġ li jiġri.
Time will tell how all this will work.	Iż-żmien se jgħid kif dan kollu se jaħdem.
It turned out really well.	Ħareġ tassew tajjeb.
I was never a person in the morning.	Qatt ma kont persuna filgħodu.
And we have.	U għandna.
Maybe that was the problem.	Forsi dik kienet il-problema.
But she was right.	Imma kellha raġun.
Definitely first.	Żgur l-ewwel.
Or we may not.	Jew nistgħu le.
Don't come to me.	M'għandekx tiġi għandi.
That's something, isn't it ?.	Dik xi ħaġa, hux?.
Maybe nothing will happen.	Forsi ma jiġri xejn.
I had enough money.	Kelli biżżejjed flus.
It's too much.	Huwa wisq.
We knew nothing.	Ma konna nafu xejn.
I believe we can be better, we always can.	Nemmen li nistgħu nkunu aħjar, dejjem nistgħu.
We would have had.	Konna kieku kellna.
To be back home.	Biex tkun lura d-dar.
There is so little we know.	Hemm daqshekk ftit li nafu.
You either would or you wouldn’t.	Inti jew kieku jew ma tkunx.
I do everything wrong.	Jien nagħmel kollox ħażin.
But there is nothing like that out there.	Imma m'hemm xejn bħal dak hemmhekk.
Not at all, actually.	Le xejn, fil-fatt.
You have to go fast.	Trid tmur malajr.
He was doing it.	Huwa kien jagħmel dan.
To tell the truth.	Ngħid il-verità.
I only did it yesterday.	Għamilt biss ilbieraħ.
We are just friends.	Aħna biss ħbieb.
Maybe there was nothing there.	Forsi ma kien hemm xejn hemmhekk.
Like, a long time.	Bħal, żmien twil.
It can be good.	Huwa jista 'jkun tajjeb.
I really thought that for a long time.	Verament ħsibt li għal żmien twil.
I never lost one.	Qatt ma tilef wieħed.
I hardly understand why.	Ma tantx nifhem għaliex.
But it wasn’t quite ready yet.	Imma għadu ma kienx lest għal kollox.
And maybe he just needs a job.	U forsi għandu bżonn biss xogħol.
It seemed to help.	Deher li jgħin.
It should not do that.	M'għandux jagħmel dan.
I often wondered about it.	Ħafna drabi kont nistaqsi dwarha.
Maybe a little too big, sometimes.	Forsi ftit wisq kbir, xi drabi.
Better each one goes.	Aħjar kull wieħed imur.
You know that.	Inti taf dan.
Much more out there.	Ħafna aktar hemmhekk.
It wasn’t a problem.	Ma kinitx problema.
Someone had to be.	Xi ħadd kellu jkun.
Pretty good really.	Pjuttost tajjeb tassew.
U le.	U le.
It's good for you that.	Huwa tajjeb għalik li.
I don’t like a lot of people.	Jien ma nħobbx ħafna nies.
Tomorrow he would have gone.	Għada kien ikun mar.
Other times not.	Drabi oħra le.
I wanted to know everything.	Ridt inkun naf kollox.
It wanted to be nothing.	Ried ikun xejn.
He was not home.	Hu ma kienx id-dar.
She is a good person.	Hija persuna tajba.
But he would not come.	Imma ma kienx jiġi.
In fact, it is not good or bad.	Fil-fatt, mhuwiex tajjeb jew ħażin.
Maybe it's more.	Forsi huwa aktar.
He didn’t know she was here.	Ma kienx jaf li kienet hawn.
At that time it was everything.	Dak iż-żmien kien kollox.
That was another thing about this job.	Dik kienet ħaġa oħra dwar dan ix-xogħol.
Not once, not once, and she knew it.	Mhux darba, mhux darba waħda, u kienet taf.
There was so much.	Kien hemm tant.
I’ve seen that you’re not sure.	Stajt nara li m'intix ċert.
They only need one.	Għandhom bżonn wieħed biss.
It should never have happened.	Qatt ma kellu jiġri.
That's not good.	Dak mhux tajjeb.
I'm sure of that.	Jien ċert, ta 'dak.
You are right, of course.	Għandek raġun, ovvjament.
Don’t be so bad.	M'għandekx tkun daqshekk ħażin.
He is not yet a man.	Għadu mhux raġel.
I don’t do that.	Jien ma nagħmel dan.
He probably wasn't.	Huwa probabbilment ma kienx.
This I did not always know.	Dan mhux dejjem kont naf.
There really wasn’t much out there.	Verament ma kienx hemm ħafna hemmhekk.
You have what you want.	Għandek dak li trid.
Also, there is no other here.	Barra minn hekk, m'hemm l-ebda ieħor hawn.
Well, we won't.	Ukoll, aħna mhux se.
You want to know who they were.	Trid tkun taf li kienu.
She can't say no.	Hija ma tistax tgħid le.
I don’t need to talk to you.	M'għandix bżonn nitkellem miegħek.
I’m sure he’s good.	Jien ċert li hu tajjeb.
I love your job.	Inħobb ix-xogħol tiegħek.
Out here.	Hawn barra.
It was as beautiful as before, maybe more.	Kienet sabiħa daqs qabel, forsi aktar.
So did she.	Hekk ukoll kellha hi.
She was not home enough.	Hija ma kinitx id-dar biżżejjed.
I'm not saying no.	Jien ma ngħid le.
She needed to talk about it.	Hija kellha bżonn titkellem dwarha.
That’s about this book.	Dak hu dwar dan il-ktieb.
It was mine.	Ġie tiegħi.
You will be back.	Inti ser tkun lura.
That's how it works.	Hekk jaħdem.
You need to eat well.	Għandek bżonn tiekol tajjeb.
In fact, it wasn’t nearly enough time.	Fil-fatt, ma kienx kważi biżżejjed żmien.
And we go from here to there what we do.	U mmorru minn hawn għal hemm dak li nagħmlu.
But he wasn't sure he could have it.	Imma ma kienx ċert li seta’ jkollu.
I hope someone can help.	Nittama li xi ħadd jista 'jgħin.
I have this car.	Ikolli din il-karozza.
I was all about it.	I kien kollu dwar dan.
They have been together for over a year.	Kienu flimkien għal aktar minn sena.
Not small and not big.	Mhux żgħir u mhux kbir.
He is a very good friend.	Huwa ħabib tajjeb ħafna.
Does anyone know why? 	Xi ħadd jaf għaliex?
Not bad anymore.	Mhux aktar ħażin.
I can do it faster on my own.	Jien nista' nagħmel aktar malajr waħdi.
It's so easy for you.	Huwa daqshekk faċli għalik.
I wasn’t able to do that.	Ma kontx kapaċi nagħmel dan.
You may be a bit too worried.	Inti tista 'tkun daqsxejn wisq inkwetat.
I have no chance.	M'għandi l-ebda ċans.
But nothing happens.	Imma ma jiġri xejn.
He does what he wants.	Jagħmel li jrid.
There were other people in the room.	Kien hemm nies oħra fil-kamra.
He would say.	Kien jgħid.
Well, that's not really why.	Ukoll, dan mhux verament għaliex.
This is actually quite great !.	Dan huwa fil-fatt pjuttost kbir!.
That was something else.	Din kienet xi ħaġa oħra.
This happens very often.	Dan jiġri ħafna drabi.
That was much better.	Dak kien ħafna aħjar.
It was more than that.	Kien aktar minn hekk.
It was easy to be around.	Huwa kien faċli li jkun madwar.
There will always be only one child.	Dejjem se jkun hemm tifel wieħed biss.
Maybe he doesn’t want to.	Forsi ma jridx.
I have to be on one or the other.	Għandi nkun fuq waħda jew oħra.
Nor does he speak.	Lanqas jitkellem.
But now you don’t.	Imma issa ma tagħmilx hekk.
Much more has been done than that.	Sar ħafna aktar minn hekk.
He would say so.	Kien jgħid hekk.
But I think there is a problem.	Imma naħseb li hemm xi problema.
You know it would.	Taf li kieku.
But here’s a lot more.	Imma hawn ħafna aktar.
They have, and will.	Għandhom, u se.
He had to keep hoping.	Kellu jibqa’ jittama.
Almost three hours.	Kważi tliet sigħat.
It would be great.	Ikun tajjeb ħafna.
But he still wasn’t going there.	Imma għadu ma kienx sejjer hemm.
We need more than that.	Għandna bżonn aktar minn hekk.
You either do or you don’t.	Inti jew tagħmel jew ma tagħmilx.
I will try so soon.	Se nipprova hekk dalwaqt.
He seems to be able to play.	Jidher li jista’ jilgħab.
I think he can play on.	Naħseb li jista' jilgħab fuq.
It was a long time.	Kien żmien twil.
He knows better than he does.	Jaf aħjar milli jagħmel dan.
Well, it’s one way or another.	Ukoll, huwa mod jew ieħor.
Well, not really.	Ukoll, mhux verament.
Everyone was happy.	Kulħadd kien kuntent.
It only works once.	Jaħdem biss darba.
He was the first.	Huwa kien l-ewwel.
As it should.	Kif għandu.
Or you don’t have to.	Jew m'għandekx għalfejn.
You are so right.	Inti daqshekk raġun.
I couldn’t try anymore.	Ma stajtx nipprova aktar.
He thought he knew what was coming.	Ħaseb li kien jaf x’kien ġej.
I hope it’s not too long.	Nispera li ma jkunx twil wisq.
It was all out.	Kien kollu barra.
I thought he was right.	Ħsibt li kellu raġun.
We knew what that was.	Konna nafu x'inhu dak.
I didn’t do any work on the book.	Jien ma għamilt l-ebda xogħol fuq il-ktieb.
I look forward to seeing more.	Nistenna li nara aktar.
She knows where he is.	Hija taf fejn hu.
We have to do it.	Għandna nagħmlu dan.
He did very well and still does.	Għamel tajjeb ħafna u għadu.
This was pretty easy.	Din kienet pjuttost faċli.
Pretty soon we were wrong.	Pjuttost malajr konna ħażin.
It may have been hours.	Jista’ jkun li kienu sigħat.
He never said anything.	Qatt ma qal xejn.
As soon as you can.	Malajr kemm tista’.
Someone is doing this.	Xi ħadd qed jagħmel dan.
Now, that would be wrong.	Issa, dan ikun ħażin.
Everything that ever happened, will happen.	Dak kollu li qatt ġara, se jiġri.
He was good to me.	Kien tajjeb miegħi.
Once for me.	Darba għalija.
A child does not know.	Tifel ma jkunx jaf.
Put it back.	Poġġa lura.
For a while it was great.	Għal xi żmien kien kbir.
And you don’t know.	U ma tkunx taf.
It has been mine for a long time as well.	Kien tiegħi għal żmien twil ukoll.
He was driving a car.	Huwa kien qed isuq karozza.
He can’t say what he wants.	Ma jistax jgħid dak li jrid.
There is nothing more in the room.	M'hemm xejn aktar fil-kamra.
Too big.	Kbir wisq.
And he is so very happy.	U huwa tant kuntent ħafna.
You should be happy too.	Għandek tkun kuntent ukoll.
But she didn’t say anything about what happened.	Imma hi ma kienet tgħid xejn dwar dak li ġara.
But it wasn’t just beautiful.	Imma ma kinitx biss sabiħa.
Everything happened very quickly.	Kollox ġara malajr ħafna.
I see you surprised.	Nara li inti sorpriż.
It should, it shouldn’t.	Għandu, ma kellux.
To be so happy.	Li tkun daqshekk kuntent.
No, that would have been my job, and he knew it.	Le, dak kien ikun ix-xogħol tiegħi, u dan kien jaf.
It could be.	Jista' jkun.
Why, he wasn't sure.	Għaliex, ma kienx ċert.
Never really be afraid of anything.	Qatt verament jibża' minn xejn.
I never knew.	Qatt ma kont naf.
I’m the same I am all the time.	Jien l-istess jien il-ħin kollu.
We have no money.	M’għandniex flus.
And this one.	U dan wieħed.
And no, it wasn’t.	U le, ma kienx.
You will not be able to stay for long.	Mhux se tkun tista’ toqgħod għal żmien twil.
It looks good.	Jidher tajjeb.
This works pretty well.	Dan jaħdem pjuttost tajjeb.
You were right about that.	Kellek raġun dwar dan.
Come with me, please.	Ejja miegħi, jekk jogħġbok.
But I don’t know why, but it’s not working.	Imma ma nafx għaliex, imma mhux qed jaħdem.
Good for a few times.	Tajjeb għal ftit drabi.
Good to be back now.	Tajjeb li ġejt lura issa.
Looks like he knew.	Qisu kien jaf.
A man should have someone to talk to.	Raġel għandu jkollu xi ħadd biex jitkellem.
Something happened, man.	Ġara xi ħaġa, raġel.
It started well.	Beda tajjeb.
He will not survive.	Mhux se jgħix.
They are for us and only for us.	Huma għalina u għalina biss.
Maybe never again.	Forsi qatt aktar.
It seemed so small.	Deher daqshekk żgħir.
Tell no one where you are from.	Għid lil ħadd minn fejn int.
And he would have been the first to say so.	U kien ikun l-ewwel li jgħid hekk.
And anyone can do it.	U kulħadd jista 'jagħmel dan.
I had a bad year.	Kelli sena ħażina.
There is so little time.	Hemm daqshekk ftit ħin.
There are a few.	Hemm ftit.
Try to talk.	Jipprova jitkellem.
But this cannot be.	Imma dan ma jistax ikun.
Not yet arrived.	Għadu mhux wasal.
I can usually say and talk about it.	Normalment nista’ ngħid u nitkellem dwar dan.
I would do that.	Nixtieq nagħmel hekk.
They will.	Huma se.
But he knew he would, someday.	Imma kien jaf li kien se, xi darba.
I'm back.	Jien għandi lura.
It should arrive within a week.	Għandu jasal fi żmien il-ġimgħa.
One thing or another.	Xi ħaġa jew oħra.
He probably didn't.	Huwa probabbilment ma kellux.
I would have been wrong to wait.	Kont inkun ħażin nistenna.
Everything is fine here and I hope you are the same.	Kollox tajjeb hawn u nittama li int l-istess.
I am buying more.	Qed nixtri aktar.
I don’t take anything back.	Jien ma nieħu xejn lura.
Everything was fine.	Kollox kien tajjeb.
Kellek.	Kellek.
Nobody knows about this.	Ħadd ma jaf b’dan.
But it will come.	Imma se tiġi.
But you can't take that.	Imma inti ma tistax tieħu dan.
Hi there.	Hi hi.
I don’t want one more.	Ma rridx waħda aktar.
I'm sure not.	Jien ċert li mhux hekk.
It’s harder than it looks.	Huwa aktar diffiċli milli jidher.
No one had that.	Ħadd ma kellu dak.
I suspect it always will be.	Nissuspetta li dejjem se jkun.
I just don’t want to.	Jien biss ma rridx.
Me too.	Jien ukoll.
Everything works.	Kollox jaħdem.
I can’t do anything more about it.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn aktar dwar dan.
I hope yours was better.	Nispera li tiegħek kien aħjar.
That will do it.	Li se tagħmel dan.
I think she is beautiful.	Naħseb li hija sabiħa.
And everyone knows that.	U kulħadd jaf li.
She needed help.	Hija kellha bżonn l-għajnuna.
I was quite surprised that I was thinking this.	Kont pjuttost sorpriż li qed naħseb dan.
She doesn't even know you're here.	Hija lanqas biss tkun taf li inti qiegħed hawn.
Mine was the same.	Tiegħi kien l-istess.
I wanted that more than anything.	Jien ridt li aktar minn kull ħaġa.
Money not.	Flus mhux.
He will see to it.	Huwa se jara li dan.
I didn’t have time to do anything.	Ma kelli ħin nagħmel xejn.
It was definitely too long.	Żgur li kien twil wisq.
You're a good boy.	Int tifel tajjeb.
Which is pretty much what happened.	Li huwa pjuttost dak li ġara.
And not just a few, but quite a lot.	U mhux biss ftit, imma pjuttost ħafna.
Nothing to see here.	Xejn x'tara hawn.
It may be my last chance.	Jista 'jkun l-aħħar ċans tiegħi.
I know this as much as anyone.	Naf dan daqs ħadd.
She is here to stay.	Hija hawn biex toqgħod.
I'm about ready.	Jien dwar lest.
This is good.	Dan huwa tajjeb.
That and much more.	Dak u ħafna aktar.
Sometimes this is not a problem.	Xi drabi din mhix problema.
This is bad for you.	Dan huwa ħażin għalik.
But there was another man as well.	Imma kien hemm raġel ieħor ukoll.
She can do it.	Hija tista 'tagħmel dan.
I did that.	Jien għamilt dak.
I don’t think it would be a problem.	Ma naħsibx għaliex tkun problema.
This is something else.	Din hija xi ħaġa oħra.
It would be good.	Ikun tajjeb.
I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately.	Dan l-aħħar ħsibt ħafna fuq dan.
It belonged to everyone.	Kien ta’ kulħadd.
I just want to say.	Irrid ngħid biss.
It never was, it never will be.	Qatt ma kien, qatt ma se jkun.
Everyone is worried.	Kulħadd huwa inkwetat.
Too much is being done for him.	Qed isir wisq għalih.
Not unless you are.	Mhux sakemm ma tkunx .
Sure, that wasn’t what anyone wanted.	Żgur, dan ma kienx dak li xi ħadd ried.
For you, it seems so.	Għalik, hekk jidher.
Very, very much.	Ħafna, ħafna.
It's a good idea.	Hija idea tajba.
It's better than it was.	Huwa aħjar milli kien.
.	.
They are all out.	Huma kollha barra.
Most people have.	Ħafna nies għandhom.
We do more than what it is.	Nagħmlu aktar minn dak li hu.
That should be all you need.	Dak għandu jkun dak kollu li għandek bżonn.
I'm totally sorry.	Jiddispjaċini għal kollox.
A man would.	Raġel kieku.
Here's something else.	Hawn xi ħaġa oħra.
There is only this.	Hemm biss dan.
We have.	Għandna.
I just think there is more.	Naħseb biss li hemm aktar.
I can’t talk for long.	Ma nistax nitkellem għal żmien twil.
But not what we have here.	Imma mhux dak li għandna hawn.
He did so today.	Illum hekk għamel.
It’s bad a lot more often than it’s good.	Huwa ħażin ħafna aktar spiss milli huwa tajjeb.
A few times.	Ftit drabi.
That definitely came before.	Li żgur ġie qabel.
Wrong for you.	Ħażin għalik.
It was a beautiful person to be around.	Kien persuna sabiħa li tkun madwar.
No one seemed to know what to say.	Ħadd ma deher li kien jaf x'għandu jgħid.
I think it’s so good.	Naħseb li hija daqshekk tajba.
It will be tonight or tomorrow afternoon !.	Ikun illejla jew għada wara nofsinhar!.
And there is a problem.	U hemm problema.
But this is not a big deal.	Imma dan mhux xi ħaġa kbira.
Worried about something.	Inkwetat dwar xi ħaġa.
But we never go.	Imma qatt ma mmorru.
There may be no time soon.	Jista’ jkun li ma jkunx hemm żmien dalwaqt.
Not too much there, of course.	Mhux wisq hemm, ovvjament.
Good and bad.	Tajjeb u ħażin.
I really don’t know anymore.	Verament ma nafx aktar.
He knew everything.	Kien ikun jaf kollox.
Something happened and.	Ġara xi ħaġa u .
And there she goes.	U hemm hi tmur.
And everything else.	U kull ħaġa oħra.
Here’s what the book was about.	Hawn x'kien il-ktieb.
It wasn’t very long.	Ma kienx twil ħafna.
It was much better.	Kien ħafna aħjar.
It can’t be that.	Ma jistax ikun dak.
I'm so scared.	Jien daqshekk jibża.
Maybe a lot more.	Forsi ħafna aktar.
But he can’t do it alone.	Imma ma jistax jagħmel dan waħdu.
But she had to.	Imma kellha.
For us, this is actually a good thing.	Għalina, din fil-fatt hija ħaġa tajba.
He was saying something.	Kien qed jgħid xi ħaġa.
But not alone.	Imma mhux waħdu.
I have no idea either.	M'għandi l-ebda idea lanqas.
I'm not happy today.	Jien mhux kuntent illum.
I just do it for myself.	Jien biss nagħmel dan għalija.
Not a really good thing.	Mhux ħaġa tajba verament.
Please anyone can help on this.	Jekk jogħġbok xi ħadd jista 'jgħin dwar dan.
It will be better now that you are here.	Hija se tkun aħjar issa li int hawn.
It can make a lot of money.	Hija tista 'tagħmel ħafna flus.
Not this soon.	Mhux dan dalwaqt.
You know you’re there.	Taf li int hemmhekk.
But he did not know where.	Imma ma kienx jaf fejn.
I don't have anything.	M'għandix xi ħaġa.
We both know what's going to happen.	It-tnejn nafu x’se jiġri.
Now we have another problem.	Issa għandna problema oħra.
I wonder how well this will do.	Nistaqsi kemm dan se jagħmel tajjeb.
This was pretty easy to do.	Dan kien pjuttost faċli li tagħmel.
He didn’t tell me anything.	Ma qalli xejn.
I do everything.	Jien nagħmel dak kollu.
That was me.	Dak kont jien.
That has to be good enough.	Dak irid ikun tajjeb biżżejjed.
In fact, we both did.	Fil-fatt, it-tnejn għamilna.
No, we are not.	Le, aħna le.
Not just for me, for everyone.	Mhux għalija biss, għal kulħadd.
Work, work, work.	Xogħol, xogħol, xogħol.
He couldn’t say so.	Ma setax jgħid hekk.
Maybe there was a better way to do it.	Forsi kien hemm mod aħjar kif tagħmel dan.
She was mine all the time.	Hija kienet tiegħi il-ħin kollu.
Just say.	Tgħid biss.
Not sure what to do.	Mhux ċert x'se jagħmel.
Everything will be ready by then.	Kollox se jkun lest sa dak iż-żmien.
Last Monday, they were.	It-Tnejn li għadda, kienu.
I can’t take that back now.	Ma nistax nieħu dak lura issa.
I’ve been there often.	Jien kont hemm spiss.
I know exactly where it comes from.	Naf eżatt minn fejn ġej.
But maybe not now.	Imma forsi mhux issa.
You must be surprised to know this.	Trid tkun sorpriż li tkun taf dan.
I can’t say why right now.	Ma nistax ngħid għaliex bħalissa.
Not now nor has it ever been.	Mhux issa u lanqas qatt ma kien.
She knew it too.	Kienet taf ukoll.
And it could be anyone.	U jista 'jkun xi ħadd.
I did nothing.	Jien ma għamilt xejn.
He said that a lot.	Huwa qal li ħafna.
This works well as well.	Dan jaħdem tajjeb ukoll.
He didn’t seem very happy.	Ma tantx deher ferħan.
This was a pretty easy one.	Din kienet waħda pjuttost faċli.
That’s what it is, isn’t it ?.	Huwa dak li hu, hux?.
Now, we can do better.	Issa, nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar.
I know it’s easy for him to do.	Naf li huwa faċli għalih li jagħmel.
You do a better job that way.	Int tagħmel xogħol aħjar hekk.
I have money.	Għandi flus.
That's not for everyone.	Li mhux għal kulħadd.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
It didn’t look good.	Ma kienx jidher tajjeb.
But now that he was here, he wasn’t so sure.	Imma issa li kien hawn, ma kienx daqshekk ċert.
That’s all we have.	Huwa dak kollu li għandna.
I hope you are doing well.	Nittama li qed tagħmel tajjeb.
Person to.	Persuna li .
He thinks I did.	Jaħseb li għamilt.
It’s none of these.	Mhuwiex l-ebda wieħed minn dawn.
This is not a difficult thing to do today.	Din mhix xi ħaġa diffiċli li tagħmel illum.
He was doing the same thing.	Kien jagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
He was good.	Huwa kien tajjeb.
I can do all things.	Kapaċi nagħmel l-affarijiet kollha.
Not with him.	Mhux miegħu.
That was much better.	Dak kien ħafna aħjar.
That was enough.	Dan kien biżżejjed.
It's just.	Huwa biss.
There weren’t too many people.	Ma kienx hemm wisq nies.
I don’t want anything.	Jien ma rrid xejn.
He didn't, actually.	Huwa ma, fil-fatt.
I did everything.	Jien għamilt kollox.
This is what happens.	Dan huwa dak li jiġri'.
You know what you need.	Taf dak li għandek bżonn.
I had to see this.	Kelli nara dan.
It’s not hard at all.	Mhu diffiċli xejn.
There is no if only here.	M'hemm l-ebda jekk biss hawn.
What they do well.	Dak li jagħmlu tajjeb.
I maybe don’t know today.	Jien forsi ma nafx illum.
All this well.	Dan kollu tajjeb.
It was something.	Kienet xi ħaġa.
Nothing had been done.	Kien sar xejn.
This is a difficult one.	Din hija waħda diffiċli.
That was too early.	Li kien kmieni wisq.
I can only be me.	Jien nista' nkun jien biss.
It was good.	Kien tajjeb.
Is there any other way to do this ?.	Hemm xi mod ieħor biex tagħmel dan?.
Something to be happy about.	Xi ħaġa li tkun kuntent dwarha.
And it works from there.	U jaħdem minn hemm.
Nor is it early.	Lanqas mhu kmieni.
I just didn’t want to believe it.	Biss ma ridtx nemmen.
And yet.	U għadu.
And about that, there is nothing we can do.	U dwar dan, m'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu.
He just thought.	Huwa biss ħaseb.
Better not know.	Aħjar ma tkun taf.
Something was wrong there.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina hemmhekk.
I needed to do that too.	Jien kelli bżonn nagħmel hekk ukoll.
We don’t have time for that.	M'għandniex ħin għal dan.
I say, you say.	Jien ngħid, tgħid int.
I will do well now.	Jien se nagħmel tajjeb issa.
It is very difficult for me.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna għalija.
Thing was, he had to try.	Ħaġa kienet, kellu jipprova.
I think this was a long time coming.	Naħseb li dan kien żmien twil ġej.
I thought he might need help.	Ħsibt li jista’ jkollu bżonn l-għajnuna.
That was too much.	Dak kien wisq.
Today was much better.	Illum kienet ħafna aħjar.
I really need a friend right now.	I verament bżonn ħabib bħalissa.
Each time, there was a problem.	Kull darba, kien hemm problema.
And he always seemed tired.	U dejjem deher li kien għajjien.
I really wanted to.	Ridt tassew.
It really was.	Kien tassew.
I know it doesn’t look like much today.	Naf li ma tantx qisu llum.
He really tried.	Huwa verament ipprova.
It may not be.	Jista’ jkun li ma jkunx.
It seems like everything is back to me.	Jidher li kollox jerġa’ lura għandi.
I’m just surprised, that’s all.	Jien biss sorpriż, dak kollu.
I wanted to have a boy.	Ridt li jkun hemm tifel.
There were problems.	Kien hemm problemi.
But above all he is mine.	Imma qabel kollox hu tiegħi.
Not that anyone else did.	Mhux li xi ħadd ieħor għamel.
Say one thing and do another.	Tgħid ħaġa u tagħmel oħra.
I do things myself.	Nagħmel l-affarijiet jien.
We were doing it together.	Konna nagħmlu dan flimkien.
He asked why.	Huwa staqsa għaliex.
Maybe he doesn’t live here anymore.	Forsi ma jgħix hawn aktar.
It was just something else.	Kien biss xi ħaġa oħra.
We knew we could do it.	Konna nafu li nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
Not coming back.	Mhux ġej lura.
Besides, he could prove it.	Barra minn hekk, huwa seta 'jipprova dan.
I think a lot about it.	Naħseb ħafna dwar dan.
I make a lot of money.	Nagħmel ħafna flus.
I wasn’t even alone.	Jien lanqas kont waħdi.
I’ve heard it all, and more.	Smajt dak kollu, u aktar.
I will say.	Se ngħid.
And this cannot be.	U dan ma jistax ikun.
There is good and bad.	Hemm tajjeb u ħażin.
It's just work.	Huwa biss xogħol.
Too small, for one thing.	Żgħir wisq, għal ħaġa waħda.
There is another problem.	Hemm problema oħra.
Maybe they are all the same.	Forsi huma kollha l-istess.
He can't, he shouldn't leave.	Ma jistax, m’għandux jitlaq.
She says I wasn’t.	Tgħid li ma kontx.
Probably the last.	Probabbilment l-aħħar.
She really looks beautiful.	Hija verament tidher sabiħa.
He said he wanted something more.	Qal li ried xi ħaġa aktar.
People, this has happened.	Nies, dan ġara.
Not for a few years.	Mhux għal ftit snin.
Definitely not so before.	Żgur li ma kienx hekk qabel.
Definitely going to buy from again !.	Żgur li se jerġa' jixtri minn!.
And you are not alone.	U m'intix waħdek.
It was too late to go back now.	Kien tard wisq biex lura issa.
I have little idea.	Għandi ftit idea.
One thing for sure.	Ħaġa waħda żgur.
I'm with him.	Jien miegħu.
It's really not difficult.	Huwa verament mhux diffiċli.
Sorry, really, really.	Jiddispjaċini, tassew, tassew.
It looked like it belonged to someone else.	Deher li kien ta’ xi ħadd ieħor.
But not enough for me.	Imma mhux biżżejjed għalija.
But good to be ready.	Imma tajjeb li tkun lest.
That would be me soon.	Dak inkun jien dalwaqt.
Everyone had so much fun.	Kulħadd ħa gost hekk.
This for him.	Dan għalih.
I will try today.	Se nipprova llum.
This should not be.	Dan m'għandux ikun.
And it really isn’t that hard.	U verament mhux daqshekk diffiċli.
Maybe there is another way.	Forsi hemm mod ieħor.
This is already happening.	Dan diġà jiġri.
That was good.	Dan kien tajjeb.
It just was more than that.	Biss kien aktar minn hekk.
He still didn’t know how to do it.	Għadu ma kienx jaf kif jagħmel dan.
They were friends, after all.	Kienu ħbieb, wara kollox.
I will go along with that.	I se mmur flimkien ma 'dak.
It might work if she was quick.	Jista 'jaħdem jekk hi kienet ta' malajr.
And you’ve been there for too long.	U inti kont hemm għal wisq żmien.
No one asked how he got there.	Ħadd ma staqsa kif wasal biex ikun hemm.
It will probably take a long time.	Probabbilment se jieħu żmien twil.
U se.	U se.
But she does nothing.	Imma hi ma tagħmel xejn.
Why should this be so difficult ?.	Għaliex dan għandu jkun daqshekk diffiċli?.
I really have to go home.	Verament għandi mmur id-dar.
I would like to do it again.	Nixtieq nerġa' nerġa'.
I want everyone to do this to me.	Irrid li kulħadd jagħmel dan miegħi.
Only one has to do.	Wieħed biss għandu jagħmel.
No, it is not always so.	Le, mhux dejjem ikun hekk.
It’s really so good.	Huwa verament daqshekk tajjeb.
No one knows where he is now.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn qiegħed issa.
I didn’t need to know before.	Ma kellix bżonn inkun naf qabel.
Not everyone did.	Mhux kulħadd għamel.
Not much we can do.	Mhux wisq nistgħu nagħmlu.
Each for his own.	Kull wieħed għal tiegħu.
You really are alone.	Int verament biss.
I have a job.	Għandi xogħol.
If anything.	Jekk xejn.
Now, have a good time.	Issa, għandhom ħin tajjeb.
But he knew better than that.	Imma kien jaf aħjar minn hekk.
Ask him out well if he is no longer absorbed in the connection.	Staqsa x’għandu jagħmel.
He was just a man.	Kien biss raġel.
I never thought so.	Jien qatt ma ħsibt.
We did nothing wrong.	Ma għamilna xejn ħażin.
I believe so.	Nemmen hekk.
He would have to do so.	Kieku kellu jagħmel hekk.
It was just busy.	Kien biss okkupat.
No one agreed.	Ħadd ma qabel.
He knew he couldn’t come back.	Kien jaf li ma setax jiġi lura.
They are friends now.	Huma ħbieb issa.
It never was and never will be.	Qatt ma kien u qatt ma se jkun.
Everything comes.	Kollox ġej.
That he would do so.	Li kien jagħmel hekk.
There he lost many friends.	Hemmhekk tilef ħafna ħbieb.
There was everything.	Kien hemm kollox.
He seemed happy.	Huwa deher kuntent.
And you want more people to do that.	U tixtieq li jkun hemm aktar nies jagħmlu dan.
That was so bad.	Dak kien tant ħażin.
When there is, there is.	Meta jkun hemm, ikun hemm.
He was a boy.	Kien tifel.
He had to be a boy, he thought.	Kellu jkun tifel, ħaseb.
All wrong.	Kollox ħażin.
Where he wanted.	Fejn ried.
It's something else !.	Hija xi ħaġa oħra!.
Everyone knew who they were.	Kulħadd kien jaf min kienu.
This is wrong.	Dan huwa ħażin.
You did nothing wrong.	Inti ma għamilt xejn ħażin.
This is not what we have here.	Dan mhuwiex dak li għandna hawn.
She is alone.	Hija waħedha.
But it really wasn’t there.	Imma verament ma kienx hemm.
This is who and what we are.	Dan hu min u dak li aħna.
She was never here.	Qatt ma kienet hawn.
Not that we are.	Mhux li aħna.
I would like some help.	Nixtieq xi għajnuna.
Good if you think about it.	Tajjeb jekk taħseb dwarha.
I know exactly what this is.	Naf eżatt x'inhu dan.
None of this, of course, ever happened.	Xejn minn dan, ovvjament, qatt ma ġara.
If not faster.	Jekk mhux aktar malajr.
It seems to be going much better.	Jidher li sejjer ħafna aħjar.
He wanted to be alone.	Ried ikun waħdu.
But something was wrong.	Imma xi ħaġa kienet ħażina.
This would be just like that.	Dan ikun eżatt bħal dan.
But it looks like someone got there before me.	Imma qisu xi ħadd wasal hemm qabel lili.
It never looked more beautiful.	Qatt ma kienet tidher aktar sabiħa.
It wasn’t for me.	Ma kienx għalija.
I will be there until tomorrow.	Inkun hemm sa għada.
I said nothing.	Jien ma għedt xejn.
I was scared and alone.	Kont nibża’ u waħdi.
Unless there is another.	Sakemm ma jkunx hemm ieħor.
She was probably right.	Probabbilment kellha raġun.
Now he had it all.	Issa kellu kollox.
No one else will do it for me.	Ħadd ieħor mhu se jagħmel għalija.
Just a little.	Ftit biss.
But you’re being nice about it.	Imma qed tkun sabiħa dwarha.
Everything you see.	Dak kollu li tara.
Not the same.	Mhux l-istess.
I have a lot to say about.	Għandi ħafna xi ngħid dwar.
It would have been easier.	Kienet tkun aktar faċli.
A little good he did.	Ftit tajjeb li għamel.
And you? 	U inti?
.	.
She would come to me there.	Kienet tiġi għandi hemmhekk.
Both of them do.	It-tnejn li huma jagħmlu.
She had no idea what she would do next.	Hija ma kellha l-ebda idea x'se tagħmel wara.
I also think that’s a good thing.	Naħseb ukoll li hija ħaġa tajba.
I couldn’t say anything.	Ma stajt ngħid xejn.
If not now.	Jekk mhux issa.
I want you to come with us.	Irrid li tiġi magħna.
Now, not everything is wrong.	Issa, mhux kollox huwa ħażin.
No, it was too much.	Le, kien wisq.
I couldn’t even believe it.	Jien lanqas stajt nemmen.
Just for a while.	Biss għal ftit żmien.
It will not go back.	Mhux se tmur lura.
Where they are.	Fejn huma.
He won’t even be in our room.	Hu lanqas se jkun fil-kamra tagħna.
How great.	Kemm hi kbira.
Sometimes this goes well, and sometimes it doesn’t.	Xi drabi dan imur tajjeb, u xi drabi le.
He wants to leave.	Irid jitlaq.
All of them have.	Kollha kemm huma għandhom.
She didn't tell me anything.	Hija ma qalli xejn.
He thought about it all.	Huwa ħaseb dwar dan kollu.
He loved to talk.	Kien iħobb jitkellem.
I didn’t think it would be so beautiful.	Ma kontx ħsibt li se tkun hekk sabiħa.
He was the first one, you know.	Hu kien l-ewwel wieħed, taf.
I'm not sure it can work.	M'inix ċert li jista' jaħdem.
To think about it now.	Biex taħseb dwarha issa.
That's so good.	Dak hekk tajjeb.
He seems to have done pretty well.	Jidher li għamel pjuttost tajjeb.
Before that, actually.	Qabel dan, fil-fatt.
It's the way it is.	Huwa mod kif tkun.
And if.	U kieku.
I should never talk to you again.	Qatt m’għandi nerġa’ nitkellem miegħek.
In addition, she will be alone.	Barra minn hekk, hi se tkun waħedha.
It was not coming.	Ma kienx ġej.
I have a son.	Għandi tifel.
Maybe a few hours.	Forsi ftit sigħat.
There was no one here.	Ma kien hemm ħadd hawn.
And this is it, you know.	U dan hu, taf.
No one is buying.	Ħadd mhu qed jixtri.
I will not ask.	Jien mhux se nistaqsi.
It doesn’t seem to fit very well anymore.	Jidher li ma tantx joqgħod hemm aktar.
And it’s not working.	U mhux qed jaħdem.
Really, she can do anything with anyone.	Tassew, hi tista 'tagħmel xi ħaġa ma' xi ħadd.
We didn’t do any of these things.	Aħna ma għamilna xejn minn dawn l-affarijiet.
I just had to be there.	Kelli biss inkun hemm.
I will talk to you and tell you everything you want.	Jien nitkellem miegħek u ngħidlek dak kollu li trid.
No, more back.	Le, aktar lura.
Everyone knew why.	Kulħadd kien jaf għaliex.
I think he knew that.	Naħseb li kien jaf li.
He will not try again.	Mhux se jerġa’ jipprova.
I'm not going to hear anything.	Jien mhux se nisma’ xi ħaġa.
No one is talking about it.	Ħadd mhu qed jitkellem dwarha.
There was something wrong with how they felt.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa ħażina ma’ kif ħassu.
To do so.	Biex tagħmel hekk.
Probably as soon as he could get there.	Probabbilment hekk kif seta’ jasal għalih.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.	Ma rridx nitkellem aktar dwarha.
He was not wearing it.	Ma kienx liebes għalih.
Your time is yet to come.	Il-ħin tiegħek għadu ġej.
There he was quite happy.	Hemm kien pjuttost kuntent.
But he needed to be sure.	Imma kellu bżonn ikun ċert.
Another good man.	Raġel ieħor tajjeb.
We had some time.	Kellna ftit ħin.
Alone he is alone.	Waħdu għadu waħdu.
But we can do a lot better, isn’t it.	Imma nistgħu nagħmlu ħafna aħjar, hux.
I thought there would be only one.	Ħsibt li jkun hemm wieħed biss.
But there was a chance.	Imma kien hemm ċans.
I don’t have that problem.	M'għandix dik il-problema.
Is there a way to do this ?.	Hemm mod kif tagħmel dan?.
He always came out early and alone.	Dejjem ħareġ kmieni u waħdu.
Maybe she never knew.	Forsi qatt ma kienet taf.
It was something he would try every now and then.	Kienet xi ħaġa li kien jipprova kull tant żmien.
He may be leaving tomorrow.	Jista’ jkun qed jitlaq għada.
He didn’t have to do that.	Ma kellux għalfejn jagħmel dan.
He lost the book.	Huwa tilef il-ktieb.
Everything was here, now.	Kollox kien hawn, issa.
Large or small.	Kbir jew żgħir.
Look at the time.	Ħares lejn il-ħin.
This is that.	Din hija dik.
It's hard not to.	Huwa diffiċli li ma tkunx.
We can be who we want to be.	Nistgħu nkunu min irridu nkunu.
And we had a good time.	U kellna ħin tajjeb.
And there it is.	U hemm.
Not easy.	Mhux faċli.
They felt better.	Ħassu aħjar.
No, you know that.	Le, inti taf li.
But they were nothing like that.	Imma ma kienu hekk xejn.
He left.	Huwa telaq.
It is now or never.	Huwa issa jew qatt.
You may well know that now.	Inti tista 'ukoll tkun taf li issa.
I still can’t believe anyone wanted it.	Għadu ma nistax nemmen li xi ħadd ried.
I didn’t believe it.	Ma kontx nemmen.
I am sure everything will be fine.	Jiena ċert li kollox se jkun tajjeb.
With a child.	Ma’ tifel.
That was for sure.	Dak kien ċert.
You stay right here with us.	Inti toqgħod eżatt hawn magħna.
You can do that.	Tista 'tagħmel għal dak.
They are more like people.	Huma aktar bħal nies.
Often it was not there.	Spiss ma kienx hemm.
He told me to come here.	Huwa qalli li inti tiġi hawn.
That would help.	Dan kien jgħin.
And it should be here.	U għandu jkun hawn.
He is alone on this.	Huwa waħdu fuq dan.
I can do anything.	Kapaċi nagħmel kull ħaġa.
You can see mine, here.	Tista 'tara tiegħi, hawn.
He’s like a boy.	Huwa bħal tifel.
I think not good.	Naħseb li mhux tajjeb.
It works every time for me.	Jaħdem kull darba għalija.
He looks like a good man.	Jidher raġel tajjeb.
Everything is great.	Kollox huwa kbir.
He was trying in the morning.	Kien jipprova filgħodu.
We had a great time with ours.	Kellna ħafna ħin ma’ tagħna.
And a great one.	U waħda kbira.
I went to him.	Mort għandu.
He said he had to go.	Qal li kellu jmur.
Most people.	Ħafna nies.
I would like to talk to you.	Nixtieq nitkellem miegħek.
This happens on more than.	Dan jiġri fuq aktar minn.
It was like, no really.	Kienet bħal, le verament.
That’s not a bad thing.	Dik mhix xi ħaġa ħażina.
Well, not quite.	Ukoll, mhux pjuttost.
I don't have to.	M'għandix.
Maybe it’s still there.	Forsi għadu hemm.
As you wish.	Kif tixtieq.
He did something.	Huwa għamel xi ħaġa.
It was definitely a beautiful thing.	Hija żgur li kienet ħaġa sabiħa.
I don’t know why there should be anyone.	Ma nafx għalfejn ikun hemm xi ħadd.
As it was then, now and always should be.	Kif kien dak iż-żmien, issa u dejjem għandu jkun.
Not only that, you know.	Mhux hekk biss, taf.
Now, it's better.	Issa, huwa aħjar.
He seems to be doing a lot.	Jidher li qed jagħmel ħafna.
I just wonder about that.	Nistaqsi biss dwar dan.
You can be sure of that.	Tista 'tkun ċert minn dan.
This is harder than you think.	Dan huwa aktar diffiċli milli taħseb.
He knows he should be glad.	Jaf li għandu jkun ferħan.
Just home.	Biss id-dar.
It was all she knew.	Kien dak kollu li kienet taf.
It seems I can’t understand why.	Jidher li ma nistax nifhem għaliex.
It wasn’t too busy.	Ma kienx okkupat wisq.
I don’t like it.	Jien ma nħobbx.
If you wish.	Jekk tixtieq.
I will be back later.	Inkun lura aktar tard.
I would be late back.	Inkun tard lura.
He was supposed to play.	Huwa suppost kellu.
She is not.	Hija ma tkunx.
It was too long ago.	Kien ilu wisq.
This is good and bad.	Dan huwa tajjeb u ħażin.
He was scared.	Huwa kien jibża.
Come how you are not.	Ejja kif m'intix.
You will do this later.	Inti ser tagħmel dan aktar tard.
And as long as you can.	U sakemm tista’.
I know I’m doing wrong.	Jien naf li nagħmel ħażin.
Nothing next week.	Il-ġimgħa d-dieħla xejn.
I wanted to do it.	Ridt tagħmel dan.
His friend asked what had happened.	Ħabib tiegħu staqsa x’ġara.
This will not be easy.	Dan mhux se jkun faċli.
But this should not be.	Imma dan m'għandux ikun.
I don’t have one.	Jien m'għandix wieħed.
Well, something had to.	Ukoll, xi ħaġa kellha.
You never know what they are doing.	Qatt ma tkun taf x'qed jagħmlu.
It shouldn’t take long.	M'għandux jieħu ħafna żmien.
I can only do that.	Nista 'biss nagħmel dan.
I'm just saying.	Jien biss ngħid.
I will never go back there.	Qatt ma nerġa’ mmur lura hemm.
I think everyone was scared.	Naħseb kulħadd kien jibża.
Do nothing about it.	Tagħmel xejn dwar dan.
She was here.	Kienet hawn.
Or so.	Jew dan.
That was likely.	Dak kien probabbli.
Maybe it was better that way.	Forsi kien aħjar hekk.
It's a great thing.	Hija ħaġa kbira.
It was hard work.	Kienet xogħol diffiċli.
On you go.	Fuq inti tmur.
But that was good for me.	Imma dan kien tajjeb għalija.
There is something here.	Hemm xi ħaġa hawn.
I wanted to tell someone about it.	Ridt ngħid lil xi ħadd dwar dan.
That is not happening.	Li mhux qed jiġri.
I take either one.	Jien nieħu jew waħda.
Surely we can do better, right ?.	Żgur li nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar, le?.
It probably will be for a while.	Probabbilment se jkun għal xi żmien.
It’s something you want to be.	Hija xi ħaġa li trid li tkun.
Usually this can be so.	Normalment dan jista' jkun hekk.
Here was a chance.	Hawn kien ċans.
You said it wouldn’t happen.	Inti għedt li mhux se jiġri.
Let’s now, let’s be friends.	Ejja issa, ejja nkunu ħbieb.
But no, never once.	Imma le, qatt darba.
More than finished.	Aktar milli lest.
There was a time for this later.	Kien hemm żmien għal dan aktar tard.
After that happened.	Wara li ġara.
I can do that now.	Nista' nagħmel dan issa.
Which it wasn’t.	Li ma kienx.
I live here.	Jien noqgħod hawn.
I just thought.	Ħsibt biss.
He, you see, wasn’t working.	Huwa, tara, ma kienx qed jaħdem.
I said I wasn’t going to.	Jien għedt li ma kienx se.
He was not a happy man.	Ma kienx raġel kuntent.
To come here.	Biex tiġi hawn.
He had seen something.	Huwa kien ra xi ħaġa.
If anything, it’s better than what came before.	Jekk xejn, huwa aħjar minn dak li ġie qabel.
That, he can live with it.	Li, huwa jista 'jgħix miegħu.
What this no one knows.	X'inhu dan ħadd ma jaf.
But it didn’t do much for me.	Imma ma tantx għamlet għalija.
I’m not doing this last thing.	Jien ma nagħmel din l-aħħar ħaġa.
But something wrong.	Imma xi ħaġa ħażina.
There was no one there.	Ma kien hemm ħadd hemmhekk.
Here are some things you can do.	Hawn huma xi affarijiet li tista 'tagħmel.
The only one yet.	L-unika waħda għadha.
I think we will do well here.	Naħseb li se nagħmlu tajjeb hawn.
What happened yesterday.	X'ġara lbieraħ.
She was talking to someone.	Kienet titkellem ma’ xi ħadd.
I didn’t want to do it anymore.	Ma ridtx nagħmel aktar.
That would be a bad thing.	Din tkun xi ħaġa ħażina.
I thought it was very beautiful.	Ħsibt li kienet sabiħa ħafna.
It's easy to tell.	Huwa faċli li tgħid.
You'll make more money soon, too.	Inti ser tagħmel aktar flus hekk, ukoll.
We can do that.	Nistgħu nagħmlu hekk.
And this is what happened next.	U dan huwa dak li ġara wara.
There is no one out here like that.	M'hemm ħadd hawn barra hekk.
And it’s some work, as you will see.	U huwa xi xogħol, kif se tara.
I needed a better man.	Kelli bżonn raġel aħjar.
Now you want to talk to us both.	Issa tixtieq titkellem magħna t-tnejn.
Now I know where I am going.	Issa naf fejn se mmur.
The same thing she did to everyone.	L-istess ħaġa li għamlet lil kulħadd.
He's just a boy.	Huwa biss tifel.
I know it won’t be the same.	Naf li mhux se jkun l-istess.
Not yet, and maybe never.	Għadha mhux, u forsi qatt.
So eat well.	Hekk ukoll tiekol tajjeb.
I don’t expect there to be a problem.	Ma nistenna li jkun hemm problema.
Definitely not that difficult.	Żgur li mhux daqshekk diffiċli.
She is unemployed.	Hija bla xogħol.
I’m ready, as you say.	Jien lest, kif tgħid.
And there seems to be only one way to do it.	U jidher li hemm mod wieħed biss biex tagħmel dan.
Obviously, each had a lot to say.	Ovvjament, kull wieħed kellu ħafna xi jgħid.
Not after last night.	Mhux wara lbieraħ filgħaxija.
He thinks he can do whatever he wants.	Jaħseb li jista’ jagħmel dak kollu li jrid.
He can't get here fast enough.	Ma jistax jasal hawn malajr biżżejjed.
I have a lot of such things.	Għandi ħafna affarijiet bħal dawn.
Hard to say.	Diffiċli ngħid.
Too many problems.	Wisq problemi.
He was happy.	Kien kuntent.
I was supposed to be the last child.	Jien suppost kont l-aħħar tifel.
Not so much.	Mhux daqshekk.
Afternoon passed for early evening.	Wara nofsinhar għadda għal kmieni filgħaxija.
He goes with you wherever you go.	Huwa jmur miegħek kull fejn tmur.
As soon as possible.	Malajr kemm jista’.
Everything was there.	Dak kollu kien hemm.
Everything will be fine when it needs to be good.	Kollox ikun tajjeb meta jkun hemm bżonn li jkun tajjeb.
It doesn’t hurt.	Ma jagħmilx ħażin.
I may not.	I jista 'ma.
He seemed more than tired.	Huwa deher aktar minn għajjien.
I was out.	Jien kont barra.
I have to talk to him about it.	Ikolli nitkellem miegħu dwar dan.
It still works.	Għadu jaħdem.
It shouldn’t happen that way.	M'għandux jiġri hekk.
It could be both.	Jista 'jkun it-tnejn.
I didn’t want anyone to know.	Ma ridt li ħadd ikun jaf.
I thought nothing else about it.	Ma ħsibt xejn ieħor dwarha.
It shouldn’t be happening here.	M'għandux ikun qed jiġri hawn.
He never had.	Qatt ma kellu.
This can be very bad.	Dan jista 'jkun ħażin ħafna.
Now you know how to stand.	Issa taf kif toqgħod.
He’s not just sitting there.	Huwa mhux biss bilqiegħda hemm.
I probably want to have some fun now.	Probabbilment irrid nieħu ftit gost issa.
One man could not do it alone.	Raġel wieħed ma setax jagħmel dan waħdu.
I still have no idea who he was.	Għadni m'għandi l-ebda idea ta' min kien.
I just want to be here already.	Irrid biss li tkun hawn diġà.
This was never going to happen.	Dan qatt ma kien se jiġri.
Well, not all the time.	Ukoll, mhux il-ħin kollu.
I saw it work.	Rajt jaħdem.
I just had to ask.	Kelli biss nistaqsi.
But there is nothing.	Imma m'hemm xejn.
I know you don’t really want to do that.	Naf li ma tantx trid tagħmel dan.
She does what she doesn’t want her to do.	Jagħmel dak li hi ma tridx li jagħmel.
I'm going to think of something.	Jien ser naħseb xi ħaġa.
It looked like fun.	Deher qisu gost.
I was a boy.	Kont tifel.
For him it was too late.	Għalih kien tard wisq.
It's been a long time.	Ilu għal żmien twil.
But so do you.	Imma hekk tagħmel dan.
It will never happen.	Qatt mhu se jiġri.
Definitely now, this is wrong.	Żgur issa, dan huwa ħażin.
She didn't know who she was.	Ma kinitx taf ta’ min kienet.
I believe I was not.	Nemmen li ma kontx.
Maybe they were never there.	Forsi qatt ma kienu hemm.
I was a good kid all the time.	Jien kont tifel tajjeb il-ħin kollu.
I’ve never seen it go wrong before.	Qatt ma rajt li tmur ħażin qabel.
He knew something.	Kien jaf xi ħaġa.
That was about everything.	Dan kien madwar kollox.
I saw that last night.	Rajt li lbieraħ filgħaxija.
Not being able to think anything.	Ma jkun kapaċi jaħseb xejn.
It works really well, almost too well.	Jaħdem tassew tajjeb, kważi tajjeb wisq.
There was no one to see.	Ma kien hemm min jara.
This should not be happening.	Dan m'għandux ikun qed jiġri.
Easy to take with you.	Faċli biex tieħu miegħek.
I know everyone here as well.	Naf li kulħadd hawn ukoll.
You only have one chance.	Għandek ċans wieħed biss.
I’m not saying you want to.	Mhux qed ngħid li trid.
I will never know for sure.	Qatt ma nkun naf żgur.
But she hardly ever stays with us.	Imma hi ma tantx qatt toqgħod magħna.
I never said anything or did anything.	Qatt ma qal xejn jew għamilt xejn.
On both of them.	Fuq it-tnejn li huma.
We are sure.	Aħna żgur.
It’s hard to say for sure.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid żgur.
But as you wish.	Imma kif trid int.
Tom certainly isn't.	Tom żgur li mhux.
I don’t know how to do that.	Ma nafx kif jagħmlu dan.
I was alone there.	Jien kont waħdi hemmhekk.
I know everyone.	Naf lil kulħadd.
It was so good to do that.	Kien daqshekk tajjeb li tagħmel dan.
He was coming back.	Huwa kien qed jiġi lura.
That was always his problem.	Dik kienet dejjem il-problema tiegħu.
There seems to be a problem.	Jidher li hemm problema.
Not always easy.	Mhux dejjem faċli.
We only know.	Nafu biss.
I did it.	Jien għamilt dan.
I can go home.	Nista’ mmur id-dar.
And he wants to do that.	U jrid jagħmel hekk.
I just want it to be good.	Irrid biss li jkun tajjeb.
Maybe it's more than that.	Forsi huwa aktar minn hekk.
If there are people outside.	Jekk hemm nies barra.
And here we are now.	U hawn aħna issa.
But he can't go back, he still can't.	Imma ma jistax jerġa’ lura, għadu mhux.
I’m there for one thing and only one thing.	Jien hemm għal ħaġa waħda u ħaġa waħda biss.
There must be something about it.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa dwarha.
It happened to everyone.	Ġara lil kulħadd.
It may seem to work.	Jista 'jidher li jaħdem.
Nothing bad can happen.	Ma jista’ jiġri xejn ħażin.
That maybe only a man can.	Li forsi raġel biss jista’.
He tried again in the morning.	Kien jerġa’ jipprova filgħodu.
But not otherwise.	Imma mhux mod ieħor.
But this is it, my friend.	Imma dan hu, ħabib tiegħi.
I should be.	I għandu jkun.
It will help, you say.	Se jgħin, inti tgħid.
That’s good to eat.	Dak tajjeb tiekol.
I have no idea what he is thinking.	M'għandi l-ebda idea x'qed jaħseb.
He had had enough, of everything.	Kellu biżżejjed, minn kollox.
Maybe that wasn’t right.	Forsi dan ma kienx tajjeb.
For quite some time.	Għal żmien mhux ħażin.
And he never had.	U qatt ma kellu.
And what not.	U dak li ma.
I was out there.	I kien hemm barra.
And that I was ready.	U li kont lest.
I'm surprised by this.	Jien sorpriż b'dan.
I could be one.	I jista 'jkun wieħed.
There were a lot of things he had yet to see.	Kien hemm ħafna affarijiet li għadu ma kellux jara.
I think we would be fine.	Naħseb li nkunu tajjeb.
Maybe she wouldn't.	Forsi hi ma tkunx.
Look at it all.	Ħares kollha.
Its all the same.	Tiegħu kollha l-istess.
But she always did.	Imma dejjem għamlet.
I have to think about it.	Ikolli naħseb dwar dan.
Just a few hours.	Ftit sigħat biss.
I have to say you are very good.	Irrid ngħid li int tajjeb ħafna.
It's just that good.	Huwa biss li tajjeb.
We are not so.	Aħna mhux hekk.
We want to be there.	Irridu nkunu hemm.
I’m going to go along with that.	Jien se mmur flimkien ma 'dak.
It's for everyone.	Huwa għal kulħadd.
I have never heard anything like this.	Qatt ma smajt xi ħaġa bħal din.
I never could after the first time.	Qatt ma stajt wara l-ewwel darba.
And me.	U jien.
I couldn’t take it anymore.	Ma stajtx nieħu aktar.
Not now, but someday.	Mhux issa, imma xi darba.
Today, he does the same.	Illum, jagħmel l-istess.
One could see what was coming.	Wieħed seta’ jara x’kien ġej.
That will not be difficult.	Li mhux se jkun diffiċli.
The last one for sure is.	L-aħħar wieħed żgur huwa.
But it was too late.	Imma kien wasal tard wisq.
He was what she was supposed to be with him.	Hu kien dak li kellha tkun miegħu.
What she did there.	Dak li għamlet hemmhekk.
And that did the job.	U dan għamel ix-xogħol.
With me, he was more playful.	Miegħi, kien aktar jilgħab.
I want to go on.	Irrid immur fuq.
You have a son.	Għandek tifel.
It’s not what he did.	Mhuwiex dak li għamel.
The only thing is.	L-unika ħaġa hi.
Just do nothing.	Biss ma tagħmel xejn.
I'm glad they do.	Jien ferħan li jagħmlu.
You went too far.	Inti mort wisq.
I think there is something to this.	Naħseb li hemm xi ħaġa għal dan.
But there is nothing more we can do.	Imma m'hemm xejn aktar li nistgħu nagħmlu.
A friend is driving in.	Ħabib qed isuq fi.
But there is nothing that will not be good.	Imma m'hemm xejn li mhux se jkun tajjeb.
Not that he wasn’t interested.	Mhux li ma kienx interessat.
Definitely there will be.	Żgur li jkun hemm.
Not much, but little.	Mhux ħafna, imma ftit.
I thought about it a little more, for the last few hours.	Ħsibt fi ftit aktar, għal dawn l-aħħar sigħat.
He had other problems.	Kellu problemi oħra.
So did someone else.	Hekk għamel xi ħadd ieħor.
I know everything here.	Naf kollox hawn.
There is so much more for you.	Hemm ħafna aktar għalik.
That’s not your problem.	Dik mhix il-problema tiegħek.
It wasn’t the first time either.	Ma kinitx l-ewwel darba lanqas.
He knew he wasn’t going to.	Kien jaf li ma kienx se.
You and she.	Inti u hi.
We just want it to be great.	Irridu biss li jkun kbir.
I know you don’t actually have anything for me.	Naf li fil-fatt m'għandekx xi ħaġa għalija.
It is not the time.	Mhuwiex iż-żmien.
Almost no one stays there forever.	Kważi ħadd jibqa’ hemm għal dejjem.
I hope it goes well.	Nispera li sejjer tajjeb.
We don't have time.	M'għandniex ħin.
I don't know how.	Jien ma nafx kif.
Obviously not easy to talk about.	Ovvjament mhux faċli li titkellem dwarha.
I never stayed with him.	Qatt ma kont noqgħod noqgħod miegħu.
I do exactly the same.	Jien nagħmel eżatt l-istess.
No one can say for how long.	Ħadd ma jista 'jgħid għal kemm żmien.
And that can be a problem.	U din tista’ tkun problema.
Almost no one wanted anything else to eat.	Kważi ħadd ma ried xi ħaġa oħra li jiekol.
He never really had friends.	Hu qatt ma verament kellu ħbieb.
And it was still about a year late.	U kien għadu madwar sena tard.
He didn’t even know what to do now.	Lanqas ma kien jaf x'għandu jagħmel issa.
She always would.	Hija dejjem kieku.
I’m willing for someone else to take on this job.	Jien lest li xi ħadd ieħor jieħu dan ix-xogħol.
It was a very good year.	Kienet sena tajba ħafna.
He thought for a moment.	Huwa ħaseb għal ftit.
Now it seemed it was all for naught.	Issa deher li kien kollu għal xejn.
But you can do something about it now.	Imma tista 'tagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha issa.
It was almost too easy, I thought.	Kien kważi faċli wisq, ħsibt.
I shouldn’t think he does.	M'għandix naħseb li jagħmel.
You can't do that here.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan hawn.
It can and will happen.	Jista’ jiġri u se jiġri.
This is really great.	Dan huwa verament kbir.
Obviously it’s work being done.	Ovvjament huwa xogħol li qed isir.
There is a way.	Hemm mod.
You know exactly why she’s here.	Taf eżatt għaliex hi hawn.
We need everything you have.	Għandna bżonn dak kollu li għandek.
In fact he did.	Fil-fatt hekk għamel.
And there was something else.	U kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
Probably later.	Probabbilment aktar tard.
I want to go, too.	Irrid immur, ukoll.
I would say.	Nixtieq ngħid.
But it wasn’t.	Imma ma kinitx.
He didn’t have to, that’s all.	Ma kellux, dak kollu.
And maybe you are.	U forsi inti.
None of the above.	Xejn minn hawn fuq.
The dog did the same.	Il-kelb għamel l-istess.
It's a few things.	Huwa ftit affarijiet.
Maybe something else is.	Forsi xi ħaġa oħra hija.
That doesn’t help anyone.	Li ma jgħin lil ħadd.
I was his last chance.	Jien kont l-aħħar ċans tiegħu.
But we ?.	Imma aħna?.
This is not what you want.	Dan mhux dak li trid.
But it was good.	Imma kien tajjeb.
It always had to work.	Dejjem kellu jaħdem.
And that's all.	U dan huwa kollox.
There was something else.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
You can count on mine.	Tista' toqgħod fuq tiegħi.
I don't need to.	M'għandix bżonn.
And there is another problem.	U hemm problema oħra.
I hope you like it.	Nispera li inti bħal dan.
Or where he went to school.	Jew fejn mar l-iskola.
You will see that.	Inti ser tara li.
He went there.	Huwa mar hemm.
Or not too much.	Jew mhux wisq.
It's very good.	Huwa tajjeb ħafna.
It just wasn’t, it seemed.	Biss ma kinitx, deher.
That may not be what it seems.	Dan ma jistax ikun dak li jidher.
Everything just works.	Kollox jaħdem biss.
Died, you know.	Miet, taf.
You need more.	Għandek bżonn aktar.
I eat a little.	niekol ftit.
I think she is good.	Naħseb li hi tajba.
No one was surprised.	Ħadd ma kien sorpriż.
He was no longer afraid.	Ma kienx jibża aktar.
After that, don’t take anything back.	Wara dan, ma tieħu xejn lura.
I didn't want to scare anyone so bad.	Ma ridt nibża’ lil ħadd daqshekk ħażin.
He was right of course.	Kellu raġun ovvjament.
And he actually has a year.	U fil-fatt għandu sena.
You should be able to do that.	Għandek tkun kapaċi tagħmel dan.
He may have already done so.	Jista’ jkun li diġà għamel dan.
I have never done anything like this.	Qatt ma għamilt xi ħaġa bħal din.
I want someone.	Irrid lil xi ħadd.
Not sure who wins here.	Mhux ċert min jirbaħ hawn.
That’s when he saw it.	Dak hu meta ra.
But it won’t come to that.	Imma mhux se jasal għal dan.
He said nothing.	Ma qal xejn.
He was completely alone.	Huwa kien għal kollox waħdu.
Not that he had much.	Mhux li kellu ħafna.
I’m not sure where I’m going to go from here.	M'inix ċert fejn se mmur minn hawn.
But currently it is not enough.	Imma bħalissa mhux biżżejjed.
Glad you came.	Kuntent li ġejt.
She didn’t know where she was.	Ma kinitx taf fejn kienet.
I have been.	Jien ġejt.
Why would he do that ?.	Għaliex kien jagħmel hekk?.
He is able to do that.	Huwa kapaċi jagħmel dan.
It wasn’t good enough anymore.	Ma kienx tajjeb biżżejjed aktar.
You are here with me.	Int hawn miegħi.
But no one is there.	Imma ħadd mhu hemm.
I hope it goes well.	Nispera li sejjer tajjeb.
He seems to be doing so.	Jidher li qed jagħmel hekk.
I was right every time.	Kelli raġun kull darba.
It's always later.	Huwa dejjem aktar tard.
But no one knew.	Imma ħadd ma kien jaf.
No one else can do this for me.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista’ jagħmel dan għalija.
They do a lot of things.	Huma jagħmlu ħafna affarijiet.
But not just my time.	Imma mhux iż-żmien tiegħi biss.
That was one problem.	Dik kienet problema waħda.
I'm for another.	Jien għal ieħor.
Plus, you’re small.	Barra minn hekk, int żgħir.
I needed to go home.	Kelli bżonn immur id-dar.
He may have been right.	Jista’ jkun li kellu raġun.
If there are problems, talk.	Jekk ikun hemm problemi, titkellem.
That was now.	Dak kien issa.
Just better, so much the better.	Biss aħjar, tant aħjar.
I'm happy.	Jien kuntent.
We are everything.	Aħna kollox.
Someone who is better for you.	Xi ħadd li huwa aħjar għalik.
We know nothing of this, of course.	Ma nafu xejn minn dan, ovvjament.
I need a job like that.	Għandi bżonn xogħol bħal dak.
You are the only one.	Int l-uniku wieħed.
I know where he goes.	Naf fejn imur.
No one talks to me here.	Ħadd ma jitkellem miegħi hawn.
He was so great.	Huwa kien tant kbir.
Needless to say.	Ma kienx hemm bżonn ngħid aktar.
I had a great time.	Kelli ħafna ħin.
That's really it.	Dak tassew.
He needed to know about it.	Huwa kellu bżonn ikun jaf dwar dan.
And you think he doesn’t like it.	U int taħseb li ma jħobbx.
And that’s good and good.	U dak tajjeb u tajjeb.
Well, good time.	Ukoll, ħin tajjeb.
Maybe very quickly.	Forsi malajr ħafna.
And maybe you think more.	U forsi taħseb aktar.
She would have known.	Kieku kienet taf.
I was already there.	Jien diġà kont hemm.
I'm a little tired.	Jien xi ftit għajjien.
It never was, it never was.	Qatt ma kien, qatt ma kien.
We know nothing more.	Ma nafu xejn aktar.
I don’t want to now.	Ma rridx issa.
I go fast.	Immur malajr.
There were only a few other people out there.	Kien hemm biss ftit nies oħra hemmhekk.
Time is money.	Iż-żmien huwa flus.
But it could have been on something.	Imma seta’ kien fuq xi ħaġa.
They never were.	Qatt ma kienu.
Or very early in the morning.	Jew kmieni ħafna filgħodu.
I definitely need to do the same.	Żgur li għandi bżonn nagħmel l-istess.
Neither do I.	Lanqas lili.
I needed something more.	Jien kelli bżonn xi ħaġa aktar.
I definitely hope so.	Jien żgur nittama li hekk.
But it was not so.	Imma ma kienx hekk.
He could do this for quite some time.	Huwa seta' jagħmel dan għal żmien pjuttost twil.
Here's the first one.	Hawn l-ewwel.
Not even something like that.	Lanqas xi ħaġa bħal din.
It wasn’t a big deal, he said.	Ma kienx xi ħaġa kbira, qal.
Well, it wasn’t likely.	Tajjeb, ma kienx probabbli.
In fact I have no idea.	Fil-fatt m'għandi l-ebda idea.
But not everything is what it seems.	Imma mhux kollox huwa dak li jidher.
But it is so.	Imma huwa hekk.
She does it all.	Hija tagħmel dan kollu.
It wasn’t more than it should have been.	Ma kienx aktar milli suppost.
Currently this works well.	Bħalissa dan jaħdem tajjeb.
This cannot be good.	Dan ma jistax ikun tajjeb.
Someone will be staying at my house.	Xi ħadd se jkun qed joqgħod id-dar tiegħi.
But she knew she had to do better than that.	Imma kienet taf li kellha tagħmel aħjar minn hekk.
There are too many out there.	Hemm wisq wisq hemmhekk.
Definitely went.	Żgur li mar.
This is your home.	Din hija d-dar tiegħek.
We’ve done enough about these things.	Għamilna biżżejjed dwar dawn l-affarijiet.
There may be no one there.	Jista’ jkun hemm ħadd hemmhekk.
Later is better.	Aktar tard huwa aħjar.
I can't do anything.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn.
She had nothing for him.	Hija ma kienet xejn għalih.
The only way, the only way.	L-uniku mod, l-uniku mod.
He was just sitting there.	Kien biss bilqiegħda hemm.
You can never tell.	Qatt ma tista’ tgħid.
I know it will.	Naf li se.
He was there all the time.	Huwa kien il-ħin kollu.
But too fast.	Imma malajr wisq.
But by then it was too late.	Imma sa dak iż-żmien kien tard wisq.
No, it wasn’t something like that.	Le, ma kienx xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I was on top of everyone.	Kont fuq kulħadd.
I’m waiting too long.	Qed nistenna wisq.
You see things.	Inti tara l-affarijiet.
He wasn’t going to go any further.	Ma kienx se jmur aktar.
It’s not supposed to happen.	Mhux suppost jiġri.
But what he thought he was not saying.	Imma dak li ħaseb li ma kienx qed jgħid.
For any of this.	Għal xi wieħed minn dan.
Everything we ever did.	Dak kollu li qatt għamilna.
Maybe it's better that way.	Forsi huwa aħjar hekk.
I want to be there as soon as possible.	Irrid inkun malajr kemm jista' jkun.
But now he was alone.	Imma issa kien waħdu.
This is my last job.	Dan huwa l-aħħar xogħol tiegħi.
No, it shouldn't.	Le, m'għandux.
He’s talking about it.	Huwa qed jitkellem dwar dan.
I'm nothing.	Jien xejn.
I believe it was him.	Nemmen li kien hu.
I still thought it was you.	Għadni ħsibt li kont int.
No, that wasn't good.	Le, dan ma kienx tajjeb.
No, no, you are not.	Le, le, li m'intix.
I wonder what he is thinking.	Nistaqsi x’qed jaħseb.
Like, never ever.	Bħal, qatt qatt.
They're all.	Huma qed kollha.
Or maybe it’s a year too late.	Jew forsi hija sena tard wisq.
But of course, better not.	Imma ovvjament, aħjar le.
But that's not all they were.	Imma dak mhux kollox kienu.
Everything he does.	Dak kollu jagħmel.
It wasn’t too big and it wasn’t too small.	Ma kienx kbir wisq u ma kienx żgħir wisq.
Or if it should be.	Jew jekk għandu jkun.
He knew he had to win.	Kien jaf li kellu jirbaħ.
.	.
I don’t think it will.	Ma naħsibx li se.
You always have to.	Dejjem għandek.
He was always interested.	Dejjem kien interessat.
There always seems to be a good year for something.	Dejjem jidher li jkun hemm sena tajba għal xi ħaġa.
Not so much anymore.	Mhux daqshekk aktar.
He just wasn’t a good man.	Hu biss ma kienx raġel tajjeb.
No one knows how he died.	Ħadd ma jaf kif miet.
Whatever it was, it was great.	Kien x’kien dan, kien kbir.
Good that everyone has his say.	Tajjeb li kulħadd ikollu jgħid tiegħu.
Maybe he did too.	Forsi għamel ukoll.
You know she is.	Taf li hi.
But you don’t need to do that.	Imma m'għandekx bżonn tagħmel dan.
And now everything has to go.	U issa jrid imur kollox.
It's not as hard as you might think.	Mhuwiex diffiċli kif inti tista 'taħseb.
I don’t see anything wrong with being happy.	Ma nara xejn ħażin li nkun kuntent.
It wasn’t so bad.	Ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
But she does it.	Imma hi tagħmel dan.
He was not going to leave.	Ma kienx se jitlaq.
I’m not so sure of that now.	M'inix daqshekk ċert minn dan issa.
And it can.	U jista '.
No one thought he would, but he did.	Ħadd ma ħaseb li kieku, imma hekk għamel.
He thought about it many times.	Huwa ħaseb dwar dan ħafna drabi.
It's just not so.	Huwa biss mhux hekk.
I want you to be as happy as possible.	Irrid li tkun ferħan kemm jista’ jkun.
One by one, so does everyone.	Wieħed wieħed, hekk jagħmel kulħadd.
I don't want any more.	Ma rridx aktar.
It’s hard to go wrong.	Huwa diffiċli li tmur ħażin.
So she had to say.	Hekk kellha tgħid hi.
A beautiful one.	Waħda sabiħa.
Obviously, it wasn’t.	Ovvjament, ma kienx.
He can say whatever he wants.	Jista’ jgħid dak li jrid.
But soon it will be.	Imma dalwaqt se jkun.
There are too few.	Hemm ftit wisq.
Every single thing.	Kull ħaġa waħda.
We don’t even know who they are.	Lanqas nafu min huma.
I know he’s not, not really.	Naf li hu mhux, mhux verament.
But you’re home now, with us.	Imma int id-dar issa, magħna.
It will be just so.	Se jkun eżatt hekk.
And there it is.	U hemm.
Because it wasn’t happening.	Għaliex ma kienx qed jiġri.
Definitely not for me.	Żgur li ma kienx għalija.
She says it's wrong.	Tgħid li huwa ħażin.
I didn’t see any of that.	Jien ma rajt xejn minn hekk.
He had a lot more to say.	Kellu ħafna aktar li ried jgħid.
I couldn’t understand why at the time.	Ma stajtx nifhem għaliex dak iż-żmien.
And it looked good.	U deher tajjeb.
If he goes back.	Jekk imur lura.
I do all this myself.	Nagħmel dan kollu jien.
That would have been good.	Dan kien ikun tajjeb.
He knew he was still thinking about it.	Kien jaf li għadu ħaseb dwarha.
It's pretty easy to do.	Huwa pjuttost faċli li tagħmel.
Win more.	Jirbaħ aktar.
Maybe it is.	Forsi huwa.
I didn’t either.	Lanqas jien ma kellix.
It’s all about work.	Dan kollu dwar ix-xogħol.
This had not happened to me.	Dan ma kienx ġara lili.
The same thing we need.	L-istess ħaġa li għandna bżonn.
I couldn’t even speak.	Jien lanqas biss stajt nitkellem.
But always the same.	Imma dejjem l-istess.
I’ll get back to that later.	Jien ser nerġa' lura għal dan aktar tard.
It's really not bad.	Huwa verament mhux ħażin.
That’s all you have.	Dan huwa dak kollu li għandek.
Everyone works whole.	Kulħadd jaħdem kollu.
I couldn’t say or do anything to do well.	Ma stajt ngħid jew nagħmel xejn biex tagħmel tajjeb.
Many times we were there together.	Ħafna drabi konna hemm flimkien.
But nothing felt right.	Imma xejn ma ħassu tajjeb.
Where not the same.	Fejn mhux l-istess.
It’s hard to say more.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid aktar.
It’s just good or bad.	Huwa biss tajjeb jew ħażin.
I want to know who knew.	Irrid inkun naf min kien jaf.
Bad, bad, very bad.	Ħażin, ħażin, ħażin ħafna.
This happened very quickly.	Dan ġara malajr ħafna.
Was this done there? 	Dan sar hemm?
and apparently it was.	u milli jidher kien.
I would be happy.	Inkun kuntent.
I hope it will look beautiful.	Nispera li se tidher sabiħa.
It’s too late for me.	Huwa tard wisq għalija.
I’m not saying you want like this.	Mhux qed ngħid li trid bħal din.
He left and went to the door.	Huwa telaq u mar lejn il-bieb.
I need to believe it wasn’t.	Għandi bżonn nemmen li ma kienx.
And there is more.	U hemm aktar.
There is just one other thing.	Hemm biss ħaġa oħra.
I’m sure there’s one.	Jien ċert li hemm waħda.
She is tired, to be sure.	Hija għajjien, biex tkun ċert.
But obviously it wasn’t going to.	Imma ovvjament ma kienx se.
There may be more so far.	Jista 'jkun hemm aktar sa issa.
We have a lot of that.	Aħna għandna ħafna minn dak.
It's easy and fast.	Huwa faċli u malajr.
Well, he had done this often enough before.	Ukoll, kien għamel dan spiss biżżejjed qabel.
We did that.	Għamilna dan.
I'm not doing this now.	Jien ma nagħmel dan issa.
Which it certainly wasn’t.	Li żgur ma kienx.
I didn’t see anyone with him.	Jien ma rajt lil ħadd miegħu.
Neither yours, either.	Lanqas tiegħek, lanqas.
So it was.	Hekk kienet.
But he knew it wasn’t.	Imma kien jaf li ma kienx.
.	.
Now there’s this, and this, and this and more.	Issa hemm dan, u dan, u dan u aktar.
It looks like a very small one.	Jidher qisu wieħed żgħir ħafna.
So it is with me.	Hekk hu miegħi.
Well, everyone does.	Ukoll, kulħadd jagħmel.
I was happy with that.	Kont kuntent b'dan.
Maybe he does now.	Forsi jagħmel issa.
Always planning.	Dejjem qed tippjana.
He said it never happened.	Qal li qatt ma ġara.
I want to eat often.	Irrid li tiekol spiss.
Maybe someday it will.	Forsi xi darba se.
It was always home, we were always together.	Dejjem kien id-dar, konna dejjem flimkien.
It could be.	Jista 'jkun.
This is an easy and quick thing to do.	Din hija ħaġa faċli u ta 'malajr li tagħmel.
And it looked like that.	U ħares hekk.
He doesn't have a car.	M’għandux karozza.
He is a good boy.	Huwa tifel tajjeb.
I wanted to, but I couldn't, I could.	Ridt, imma ma stajtx, tista’.
And do it often.	U tagħmel dan spiss.
Not a good way to go.	Mhux mod tajjeb biex tmur.
It was better that way.	Kien aħjar hekk.
But there is something more.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa aktar.
Everything went well.	Kollox mar tajjeb.
He can happen and play.	Huwa jista 'jiġri u jilgħab.
And it should.	U għandu.
This can be good.	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb.
Not very good.	Mhix tajjeb ħafna.
I'm just like that.	Jien biss hekk.
This may or may not help.	Dan jista 'jew ma jistax jgħin.
He came on.	Huwa daħal fuq.
And no one said anything.	U ħadd ma qal xejn.
All alone.	Kollha waħdi.
But that won't do.	Imma li mhux se jagħmlu.
Here's how it will work.	Hawn kif dan se jaħdem.
And maybe he is.	U forsi hu.
This seems likely.	Dan jidher probabbli.
I need your help here.	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek hawn.
He’s been thinking a lot about it lately.	Huwa kien qed jaħseb ħafna dwarha dan l-aħħar.
It doesn’t happen to anyone.	Ma jiġri lil ħadd.
That's work.	Dak hu xogħol.
Not even that.	Lanqas dan biss.
This must be accurate.	Dan għandu jkun eżatt.
No more talking now.	Mhux aktar titkellem issa.
He is here to help.	Huwa hawn biex jgħin.
He had to come back, he had to.	Kellu jiġi lura, kellu.
But she had had enough.	Imma kienet kellha biżżejjed.
We have no problem with that.	M'għandniex problema b'dan.
I wasn’t having any more fun.	Ma kontx nieħu gost aktar.
I’ve been thinking again.	Stajt naħseb mill-ġdid.
He couldn’t come and go as he wants.	Ma setax jiġi u jmur kif irid.
I don’t want this on anyone.	Jien ma nixtieq dan lil ħadd.
No one knows where this came from.	Ħadd ma jaf minn fejn ġie dan.
I never say.	Qatt ma ngħid.
This took time, years.	Dan ħa żmien, snin.
He said it was wrong.	Huwa qal li kien ħażin.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwarha.
I don’t like to wait.	Ma nħobbx nistenna.
Here's one way.	Hawn mod wieħed.
You can't.	Inti ma tistax.
Pretty big thing to be first.	Ħaġa pjuttost kbira li tkun l-ewwel.
He came out.	Ħareġ barra.
Maybe she knew something.	Forsi kienet tkun taf xi ħaġa.
He could do that today if he wanted to.	Seta’ jagħmel dan illum jekk ried.
If you want to talk, come to me.	Jekk trid titkellem, tiġi għandi.
He thought about a time when he was happy.	Huwa ħaseb dwar żmien meta kien kuntent.
For just a little.	Għal ftit biss.
He said he would win.	Qal li se jirbaħ.
Just nothing happens.	Biss ma jiġri xejn.
It must be me.	Għandu jkun jien.
I still think it’s a bad idea.	Għadni naħseb li hija idea ħażina.
It was there forever.	Kien hemm għal dejjem.
Just be with me.	Ejja biss miegħi.
I really hope everything works.	Verament nittama li kollox jaħdem.
No one alone will be enough.	L-ebda wieħed ma jkun biżżejjed waħdu.
I was so young.	Kont tant żgħir.
Not to mention.	Lanqas ta’ min jgħid.
He couldn’t do enough.	Ma setax jagħmel biżżejjed.
Pretty much mine alone.	Pjuttost tiegħi biss.
Or maybe outside.	Jew forsi barra.
I should be talking.	Għandi nkun qed nitkellem.
But he is a man.	Imma hu raġel.
She actually knew someone.	Fil-fatt kienet taf lil xi ħadd.
There! 	Hemm!
there! 	hemm!
She didn't.	Hija ma .
I will be with you all the time.	Jien inkun miegħek il-ħin kollu.
Now he needed to know why.	Issa kellu bżonn ikun jaf għaliex.
I'm sure it will.	Jien ċert li se.
You’ve been there for a long time.	Inti kont hemm għal żmien twil.
Too much, you might say.	Wisq hekk, tista 'tgħid.
No, not so much.	Le, mhux hekk.
He was right, of course.	Kellu raġun, ovvjament.
You must be visible.	Trid tkun tidher.
It's just easy.	Huwa biss faċli.
But you know about it.	Imma int taf dwar dan.
It can make you a child again.	Jista 'jagħmel inti tifel mill-ġdid.
But you know his.	Imma int taf tiegħu.
No one can do that.	Ħadd ma jista’ jagħmel dan.
It was nothing but.	Kien xejn imma.
There was no one to think about it either.	Lanqas ma kien hemm min jaħseb dwarha.
That’s all about it.	Dak hu kollu dwar dan.
Well tomorrow has come.	Ukoll għada wasal.
I think it was just one.	Naħseb li kien wieħed biss.
Everything for everyone.	Kollox għal kulħadd.
But it looks like he wanted to say more.	Imma qisu ried jgħid aktar.
Or early in the morning.	Jew kmieni filgħodu.
I know what you're thinking.	Naf x’se tkun dalwaqt taħseb.
Anything you want.	Kull ħaġa li trid.
Everything goes if you want.	Kollox imur jekk trid.
But she was out.	Imma hi kienet barra.
That’s good for me.	Dak hu tajjeb miegħi.
He would be the first.	Hu jkun l-ewwel wieħed.
This was not to happen, as ever.	Dan ma kellux jiġri, bħal qatt.
I’m so tired of being so big.	Jien tant għajjien li nkun daqshekk kbir.
There may be a problem now.	Issa jista’ jkun hemm problema.
There was something about.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa dwar.
Obviously, the same thing.	Ovvjament, l-istess ħaġa.
That's not enough.	Dak mhux biżżejjed.
Ridt le.	Ridt le.
It's for me.	Huwa għalija.
She will eat well.	Hija ser tiekol tajjeb.
You know, for me.	Taf, għalija.
Easy thing.	Ħaġa faċli.
So you know.	Hekk taf.
Apparently they were both at school yesterday.	Jidher li lbieraħ kienu t-tnejn l-iskola.
Everything works on this.	Kollox jaħdem fuq dan.
We’re not doing anything like that.	Aħna mhux qed nagħmlu xi ħaġa bħal dik.
It had to happen someday.	Kellu jiġri xi darba.
I need a car.	Għandi bżonn karozza.
He seems to be a good man.	Jidher li hu raġel tajjeb.
I can't believe he's doing that again.	Ma nistax nemmen li jerġa' jagħmel hekk.
Say nothing now.	Tgħid xejn issa.
But he was still a big boy.	Imma kien għadu tifel kbir.
I don’t know where the problem might be.	Ma nafx fejn tista' tkun il-problema.
Bad idea.	Idea ħażina.
You have, you are his friend.	Għandek, int ħabib tiegħu.
For a while.	Għal ftit.
I'm still tired.	Għadni għajjien.
You are a beautiful person.	Int persuna sabiħa.
I can see that now.	Dan nista' nara issa.
I really can’t believe this.	Verament ma nistax nemmen dan.
He can't have that.	Ma jistax ikollu dak.
I like to hear things like that.	Inħobb nisma’ affarijiet bħal dawn.
I'm not sure how.	M'inix ċert kif.
I'll tell you what it was for me.	Jien ngħidlek x’kien għalija.
In fact I couldn’t tell.	Fil-fatt ma stajtx ngħid.
But if you can’t do it, and you can’t come.	Imma jekk ma tistax tagħmel dan, u ma tistax tiġi.
Or quite enough.	Jew pjuttost biżżejjed.
It seemed easy and maybe helpful.	Deher faċli u forsi ta’ għajnuna.
He wanted to know who he was.	Ried ikun jaf min kien.
He just died.	Huwa biss miet.
He knew it wasn’t going to be.	Kien jaf li ma kienx se jkun.
I had never done one before.	Qatt ma kelli nagħmel waħda qabel.
And there is enough time.	U hemm biżżejjed ħin.
She needed time to think.	Hija kellha bżonn iż-żmien biex taħseb.
It just seems too bad.	Jidher biss ħażin wisq.
Everything is ready.	Kollox lest.
And you look tired too.	U inti tidher għajjien ukoll.
I couldn’t think of anything to say.	Ma stajtx taħseb xi tgħid.
It always happened to me.	Dejjem ġara lili.
It will be home tomorrow.	Se tkun id-dar għada.
Not good at all.	Mhux tajjeb xejn.
It will not happen.	Mhux se jiġri.
He’s not here right now.	Hu mhux hawn bħalissa.
I have to stay.	Ikolli noqgħod.
And you’re going too fast.	U int sejjer malajr wisq.
But she did, you did.	Imma hi għamlet, int għamilt.
We will be together forever, she says.	Se nkunu flimkien għal dejjem, tgħid.
He thought to tell the truth, too.	Huwa ħaseb biex jgħid il-verità, ukoll.
It wasn’t going to happen.	Ma kienx jiġri.
He had said this.	Huwa kien qal dan.
I couldn’t believe it.	Ma setax nemmen.
I played back.	I kellha lura.
It was so helpful.	Kien ta’ tant għajnuna.
It was good of me.	Kien tajjeb minni.
He will be home soon and long enough.	Huwa ser ikun id-dar dalwaqt u twil biżżejjed.
After that, too.	Wara dan, ukoll.
So he did here.	Hekk għamel hawn.
Wherever he goes, he wants to go.	Fejn tmur, hu jrid imur.
I'm really, really.	Jien tassew tassew.
Maybe too much.	Forsi wisq.
It is very difficult for everyone.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna għal kulħadd.
It wasn’t much.	Ma kienx ħafna.
That is.	Li hu.
And this had happened.	U dan kien ġara.
You need to sit down.	Għandek bżonn toqgħod bilqiegħda.
Nobody knew what happened.	Ħadd ma kien jaf x’ġara.
They are, really.	Huma, tassew.
I think it would be easier.	Naħseb li jkun aktar faċli.
He sat back.	Huwa poġġa lura.
The first came from behind.	L-ewwel ġie minn wara.
Well, well, maybe just a little bit.	Tajjeb, ukoll, forsi ftit biss.
And you.	U int .
Of course you can go.	Ovvjament tista’ tmur.
It would happen.	Ikun jiġri.
About a year ago.	Madwar sena ilu.
I'm not capable.	Jien mhux kapaċi.
But now it is too late.	Imma issa huwa tard wisq.
I need to eat.	Għandi bżonn niekol.
But it can't either.	Imma jista' lanqas ma.
We probably have.	Probabbilment għandna.
The latter happened first.	L-aħħar ġara l-ewwel.
I know why.	Naf għaliex.
He was so happy.	Huwa kien tant kuntent.
He still doesn't.	Huwa għadu ma.
Some friends we are.	Xi ħbieb aħna.
And just be.	U jkun biss.
You are not bad.	Inti mhux ħażin.
Come here tomorrow.	Ejja hawn għada.
Obviously, you are not.	Ovvjament, m'intix.
No one really knows what will happen.	Ħadd ma jaf tassew x'se jiġri.
I was fine, but not now.	Kont tajjeb, imma mhux issa.
It can be someone who is great or not.	Jista 'xi ħadd li huwa kbir jew le.
There is no help for you.	M'hemm l-ebda għajnuna għalik.
I think this should be good.	Naħseb li dan għandu jkun tajjeb.
It looks good.	Jidher tajjeb.
I thought I better not say anything.	Ħsibt li aħjar ma ngħid xejn.
That wasn’t what it was.	Dan ma kienx dak.
And maybe that was a good thing.	U forsi dik kienet xi ħaġa tajba.
It does too.	Jagħmel ukoll.
I’m not sure what it is.	M'inix ċert x'inhu.
Maybe you’re not good either.	Forsi m'intix tajjeb lanqas.
It never was and never will be.	Qatt ma kien u qatt mhu se jkun.
You don’t want to know, he says.	Inti ma tridx li tkun taf, huwa jgħid.
Many.	Ħafna .
When you tell me all these things.	Meta tgħidli dawn l-affarijiet kollha.
He said he knew you.	Qal li taf int.
You can either do it or you can't.	Inti jew tista 'tagħmel dan jew ma tistax.
He was having fun.	Kien qed jieħu gost.
But that’s not what he thinks.	Imma dan mhux dak li jaħseb.
Not with him either.	Mhux miegħu lanqas.
But we are not.	Imma aħna le.
There were a lot of people.	Kien hemm ħafna nies.
There was only one chance.	Kien hemm ċans wieħed biss.
That you want to.	Li inti tixtieq li.
No, better than that.	Le, aħjar minn hekk.
I thought it was so.	Ħsibt li kien hekk.
Probably she did.	Probabbilment hija għamlet.
That is for sure.	Dan huwa ċert.
Never before.	Minn qatt qabel.
It always is.	Huwa dejjem.
You’re not saying anything.	Mhux qed tgħid xejn.
Both of them knew.	It-tnejn li huma kienet taf.
But it doesn’t have to be with you.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn ikun miegħek.
But it’s hard not to say anything.	Imma huwa diffiċli li ma tgħid xi ħaġa.
We had done a lot together.	Konna għamilna ħafna flimkien.
He didn’t want to talk much.	Ma riedx jitkellem ħafna.
I have a job.	Għandi xogħol.
He had done everything.	Huwa kien għamel minn kollox.
This is quite a lot of money.	Dan huwa pjuttost ħafna flus.
It’s not about being better than anyone.	Mhuwiex dwar li tkun aħjar minn ħadd.
And so it was.	U hekk kien.
There is nothing now.	M'hemm xejn issa.
And everyone seems to think so too.	U jidher li kulħadd ħaseb hekk ukoll.
I don't think it's going to go wrong again now.	Ma naħsibx li se jerġa’ jmur ħażin issa.
I think it’s great.	Naħseb li huwa kbir.
No, not so much.	Le, mhux daqshekk ħafna.
So much the better for you.	Tant aħjar għalik.
Not much.	Mhix ħafna.
Now you’re also talking better late than never.	Issa int ukoll titkellem aħjar tard milli qatt.
I want you to know something.	Irrid li tkun taf xi ħaġa.
That’s not me to be sure.	Dak mhux jien inkun ċert.
He wasn't sure what to expect, what to do.	Hu ma kienx ċert x’se jistenna, x’se tagħmel hi.
I don’t need one.	M'għandix bżonn wieħed.
He sure was with me.	Huwa żgur li kien miegħi.
There is always another way.	Dejjem hemm mod ieħor.
Go with me.	Imur miegħi.
You have that before you.	Inti għandek li qabel int.
Not that we did much.	Mhux li għamilna ħafna.
Everything went wrong.	Kollox mar ħażin.
Will he do it again ?.	Se jerġa jagħmel?.
We will know soon.	Dalwaqt nafu.
John takes nothing.	John ma jieħu xejn.
Everything else looks good.	Kollox ieħor jidher tajjeb.
We do all this for you.	Aħna nagħmlu dan kollu għalik.
It's tomorrow evening.	Huwa għada filgħaxija.
I have everything working.	Għandi dak kollu jaħdem.
It always has been, it always has been.	Dejjem kien, dejjem kien.
And still today.	U għadu llum.
I have a few.	Għandi ftit.
And as you see here.	U kif tara hawn.
I never knew who they were.	Qatt ma kont naf li kienu huma.
It was late.	Kien sar tard.
This is the only way.	Dan huwa l-uniku mod.
Besides, it was.	Barra minn hekk, kien.
They were better, maybe.	Kienu aħjar, forsi.
And there it is.	U hemm.
We can do the same.	Nistgħu nagħmlu l-istess.
Someone to talk to.	Xi ħadd li jista’ jitkellem miegħu.
I’m here a lot.	Jien hawn ħafna.
It's a chance.	Hu ċans.
They are always there.	Huma dejjem hemm.
Lots of help.	Ħafna għajnuna.
I can do a lot.	Kapaċi nagħmel ħafna.
Try something else.	Ipprova xi ħaġa oħra.
He knows better.	Jaf aħjar.
Maybe that was too long.	Forsi dak kien twil wisq.
Well, no more.	Ukoll, mhux aktar.
Maybe a lot more.	Forsi ħafna aktar.
Or you know.	Jew int taf.
There may be.	Jista' jkun hemm.
We were a little late.	Konna ftit tard.
Something he never does.	Xi ħaġa li qatt ma jagħmel.
I’m not even tired.	Jien lanqas għajjien.
We did the same thing.	Għamilna l-istess ħaġa.
Maybe it’s too early for me.	Forsi huwa kmieni wisq għalija.
And now.	U issa.
Everything goes one way.	Kollox imur mod wieħed.
Better than being in love with anyone.	Aħjar milli tkun inħobb ma ħadd.
And of course it was.	U ovvjament kien.
It just actually wasn’t like that, obviously.	Biss fil-fatt ma kienx hekk, ovvjament.
It can happen very quickly.	Jista 'jiġri malajr ħafna.
I knew a lot more.	Kont naf ħafna aktar.
I wasn’t nearly ready.	Jien ma kontx kważi lest.
I’m going about it wrong.	Jien sejjer dwar dan ħażin.
It's just not my thing.	Huwa biss mhux ħaġa tiegħi.
That’s what we need.	Dak hu li għandna bżonn.
They are not together.	Huma mhux flimkien.
I want to do this job.	Irrid nagħmel dan ix-xogħol.
Nor is there anything wrong.	Lanqas hemm xejn ħażin.
This is eating.	Dan qed jiekol.
He doesn't seem to have any friends.	Jidher li m’għandux ħbieb.
We are supposed to.	Aħna suppost.
Not sure how to go about it.	Mhux ċert kif għandek tmur dwar dan.
And we really can.	U tassew nistgħu.
Man, it looks like.	Raġel, qisu.
Will you be watching ?.	Se tkun qed tara?.
That was a few years ago now.	Dan kien ftit snin ilu issa.
She needed a friend.	Hija kellha bżonn ħabib.
You, you know, don’t tell me anything.	Int, taf, ma tgħidli xejn.
Everyone wanted to appear with him.	Kulħadd ried jidher miegħu.
I think you shouldn’t go.	Naħseb li m'għandekx tmur.
How are you going.	Kif sejjer.
It may be too late now.	Issa jista’ jkun tard wisq.
You can say what you want about.	Inti tista 'tgħid dak li tixtieq dwar.
And it scares a lot of people.	U jibża’ ħafna nies.
I’m not sure how I do that.	M'inix ċert kif nagħmel dan.
He may know something.	Jista’ jkun jaf xi ħaġa.
It’s hard for me to still believe.	Huwa diffiċli għalija li għadha nemmen.
It's just not good.	Huwa biss mhux tajjeb.
It takes time.	Jeħtieġ iż-żmien.
Many, many years.	Ħafna, ħafna snin.
No, my friend.	Le, ħabib tiegħi.
There is.	Hemm .
He was doing it again.	Huwa kien qed jagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
He can't see.	Ma jistax jara.
And everything very quickly.	U kollox malajr ħafna.
This is not a problem.	Din mhix problema.
He had not left.	Ma kienx telaq.
It's so easy.	Huwa daqshekk faċli.
And after that, we do everything right for you.	U wara dan, aħna nagħmlu kollox tajjeb għalik.
I want to be happy.	Irrid inkun kuntent.
He doesn’t want to go home.	Ma jridx imur id-dar.
You can't do that.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan.
In fact we were only a few years back.	Fil-fatt konna lura biss ftit snin.
I actually couldn’t think of anything better.	Fil-fatt ma stajt naħseb xejn aħjar.
Who is there? 	Min hemm?
.	.
It was always there.	Dejjem kien hemm.
He was trying to be.	Kien qed jipprova jkun.
You don't always do it as fast as possible.	Inti mhux dejjem tagħmel dan malajr kemm jista 'jkun.
After all, everyone should eat.	Wara kollox, kulħadd għandu jiekol.
She knew it too.	Kienet taf ukoll.
That’s not always a good thing.	Dik mhux dejjem hija ħaġa tajba.
She didn’t tell me more than that.	Hija ma kinitx tgħidli aktar minn hekk.
It’s not nearly as much fun.	Mhuwiex kważi daqshekk gost.
There is no way he can see.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li jista 'jara.
I know you want to do this.	Naf li trid tagħmel dan.
Another, and another, and another.	Ieħor, u ieħor, u ieħor.
There was nothing on.	Ma kien hemm xejn fuq.
There is no right or wrong.	M'hemm l-ebda tajjeb jew ħażin.
And it was only a year.	U kienet biss sena.
Maybe there shouldn’t be.	Forsi m'għandux ikun hemm.
I have nothing.	M'għandi xejn.
And that was when it came to us.	U dak kien meta ġie għalina.
She was alone here.	Kienet waħedha hawn.
It couldn’t be happier.	Ma jistax ikun aktar ferħan.
I wasn’t expecting anything more !.	Jien ma kont nistenna xejn aktar!.
There may be a chance.	Jista 'jkun hemm ċans.
But that was not my problem.	Imma dik ma kinitx il-problema tiegħi.
But this will not happen.	Imma dan mhux se jiġri.
I’m worried about it.	Jien inkwetat dwarha.
Surely he knew before.	Żgur li kien ikun jaf qabel.
It should be here.	Għandu jkun hawn.
You can do everything.	Tista 'tagħmel dak kollu.
That was all a long time ago.	Dan kien kollu żmien twil ilu.
But it says nothing.	Imma ma jgħid xejn.
It was very good.	Kien tajjeb ħafna.
That would have been easy too.	Dan kien ikun faċli wisq.
I think that could happen.	Naħseb li jista' jiġri.
It is taking a long time.	Qed jieħu ħafna ħin.
And now we know there is a better way.	U issa nafu li hemm mod aħjar.
Sometimes it looks pretty good.	Xi drabi jidher pjuttost tajjeb.
You're supposed to.	Int suppost.
What he did made sure everyone came home.	Dak li għamel żgur li kulħadd jiġi d-dar.
It’s working, but it’s working too well.	Qed jaħdem, imma qed jaħdem tajjeb wisq.
She will stay here.	Hija se toqgħod hawn.
I don’t know exactly.	Ma nafx eżatt.
I can do that.	Nista 'nagħmel hekk.
It's too busy.	Huwa okkupat wisq.
And he wasn’t playing.	U ma kienx qed jilgħab.
He is glad to do so.	Huwa ferħan li jagħmel dan.
And so it should be.	U hekk għandu jkun.
Lots of things, actually.	Ħafna affarijiet, fil-fatt.
You don’t need one more.	M'għandekx bżonn waħda aktar.
Can you see? 	Tista 'tara?
Never tell where you are from.	Qatt tgħid minn fejn int.
You have to be ready for more than that.	Trid tkun lest għal aktar minn hekk.
He could see it all.	Huwa seta 'jara dan kollu.
You don’t plan something like that.	Inti ma tippjana xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I don’t have much of an idea.	M'għandix ħafna idea.
I have never seen a man like that, ever.	Qatt ma rajt raġel bħal hekk, qatt.
Everything that has ever been there.	Dak kollu li qatt kien hemm.
And you have too.	U għandek ukoll.
It couldn't be him.	Ma setax ikun hu.
There he was.	Hemmhekk kien.
It was all the same for me.	Kien kollu l-istess għalija.
But that was years ago.	Imma dan kien snin ilu.
I already had to wait so long.	Diġà kelli nistenna daqshekk.
It was a lot of work.	Kien ħafna xogħol.
And this morning.	U dan filgħodu.
Everything was still, and there was no one about it.	Kollox kien għadu, u ma kien hemm ħadd dwar.
No one is around.	Ħadd mhu madwar.
I don’t want that anymore.	Ma rridx hekk aktar.
It was some years ago.	Kien xi snin ilu.
And no one had seen anything.	U ħadd ma kien ra xejn.
There were so many people there.	Kien hemm tant nies hemmhekk.
The problem.	Il-problema .
But she knows.	Imma hi taf.
This house is too big.	Din id-dar hija kbira wisq.
It was coming for me.	Kien ġej għalija.
Well, it seems to be now.	Ukoll, jidher li għandu issa.
Not good for another, but good for you.	Mhux tajjeb għal ieħor, imma tajjeb għalik.
All the work was done.	Ix-xogħol sar kollu.
He never worried about it.	Hu qatt ma inkwetat dwar dan.
For me, it was.	Għalija, kien.
There was something there.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
He probably was.	Huwa probabbilment kien.
You know, for a long time.	Taf, għal żmien twil.
You just need to be able to see you.	Għandek bżonn biss li tkun tista 'tara inti.
I will say this only.	Se ngħid dan biss.
She knew she looked beautiful.	Kienet taf li kienet tidher sabiħa.
He just didn’t have much to say.	Huwa biss ma kellux ħafna xi jgħid.
That's what you have to do.	Dak hu li għandek tagħmel.
Now, that won’t happen.	Issa, dan mhux se jiġri.
It won’t be the first.	Mhux se jkun l-ewwel.
I like things like that.	Inħobb affarijiet bħal dawn.
He was always here.	Dejjem kien hawn.
He did, too.	Huwa għamel, ukoll.
This has already begun.	Dan diġà beda.
I can’t go back on that.	Ma nistax immur lura fuq dak.
She was doing it.	Hija kienet tagħmel dan.
This could not be happening.	Dan ma setax ikun qed jiġri.
It’s always easier with someone else.	Huwa dejjem aktar faċli ma 'xi ħadd ieħor.
That says a lot.	Dan jgħid ħafna.
I haven’t thought about it in a long time.	Ilni ma naħseb dwar dan.
I don’t believe anything.	Jien ma nemmen xejn.
This, above all.	Dan, fuq kollox.
It was all he knew.	Kien dak kollu li kien jaf.
You see that now.	Inti tara li issa.
he asked.	staqsa.
Really think there.	Tassew taħseb hemmhekk.
But everyone is.	Imma kulħadd hu.
That was a good time.	Dak kien żmien tajjeb.
In fact I was never there.	Fil-fatt qatt ma kont hemm.
I will say no more.	Mhux se ngħid aktar.
In fact, they are too late for that.	Fil-fatt, huma tard wisq għal dan.
I know you’re there.	Naf li int hemmhekk.
There is nothing wrong with it.	M'hemm xejn ħażin miegħu.
He doesn’t have to see anything like that.	M'għandux għalfejn jara xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I’m not going to be the first.	Jien mhux se nkun l-ewwel.
No one did anything.	Ħadd ma għamel xi ħaġa.
You alone.	Inti biss.
I did it alone.	Jien għamilt dan waħdi.
If it happens, great.	Jekk jiġri, kbir.
You know it is.	Taf li se.
But for me, it’s great.	Imma għalija, huwa kbir.
I never buy one.	Qatt ma nixtri waħda.
His afternoon was not going well.	Wara nofsinhar tiegħu ma kienx sejjer tajjeb.
I'm very good.	Jien tajjeb ħafna.
I always came back.	Dejjem ġejt lura.
Not everyone can do that.	Mhux kulħadd jista’ jagħmel dan.
I love everything too.	Jien inħobb kollox ukoll.
Around and around.	Madwar u madwar.
You have to tell me everything.	Trid tgħidli kollox.
And she will never be home.	U hi qatt ma tkun id-dar.
Everything works for nothing.	Dak kollu jaħdem għal xejn.
I need help now.	Għandi bżonn l-għajnuna issa.
And no it never was.	U le qatt ma kienet.
It was too much.	Kien wisq.
This is just wrong.	Dan huwa biss ħażin.
It was too much for him to work.	Kien wisq għalih biex jaħdem.
I just need someone to talk to.	Għandi bżonn biss lil xi ħadd biex nitkellem.
But now, no.	Imma issa, le.
Good good, good.	Tajjeb tajjeb, tajjeb.
She knew it would come.	Kienet taf li se jiġi.
.	.
She never needed anything.	Qatt ma kellha bżonn ta’ xejn.
I loved it too.	Jien kont inħobb ukoll.
Or it was out.	Jew kien barra.
A few other things.	Ftit affarijiet oħra.
Much faster.	Ħafna aktar malajr.
He did not know where he was.	Ma kienx jaf fejn kien.
But you'll see soon enough.	Imma int ser tara malajr biżżejjed.
And it is this.	U huwa dan.
He knew he knew he knew.	Kien jaf li kien jaf li kien jaf.
I didn’t have to do that.	Jien ma kellix għalfejn nagħmel hekk.
Nothing more than sitting down.	Xejn aktar minn bilqiegħda.
I really, really want to.	Jien tassew, verament nixtieq.
Probably had.	Probabbilment kellha.
Glad you are having a good time.	Ferħan li qed tieħu ħin tajjeb.
That’s not who she was.	Dik mhux min kienet.
You know how to do it.	Inti taf kif tagħmel dan.
But it was for me.	Imma kien għalija.
You never come home.	Qatt ma tiġi d-dar.
But we had a great time.	Imma kellna ħafna ħin.
This is not how it works.	Dan mhux kif jaħdem.
But we made it out of there.	Imma għamilna barra minn hemm.
I know how to do it.	Naf kif nagħmel.
Think about everything.	Taħseb dwar kollox.
That time had to be now.	Dak iż-żmien kellu jkun issa.
That would be all.	Li jkun hemm kollha.
It really isn't.	Huwa verament mhux.
I have never heard this before.	Qatt ma smajt dan qabel.
She was saying a lot about who I was.	Kienet tgħid ħafna dwar min kont.
John wants to survive.	John irid jgħix.
I think he can wait.	Naħseb li jista’ jistenna.
He is all alone.	Huwa kollu waħdu.
This is pretty good.	Dan huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
No, not really.	Le, mhux verament.
It's just.	Huwa biss.
That is.	Li hu.
I had to eat something.	I kellha tiekol xi ħaġa.
Everyone who has come to live with us.	Kull min ġie jgħix magħna.
Maybe another one.	Forsi waħda oħra.
It has not always been so.	Mhux dejjem kien hekk.
I had to ask.	Kelli nistaqsi.
I know he can do that.	Naf li jista’ jagħmel hekk.
You know what happened.	Taf x’ġara.
Not all there.	Mhux kollha hemm.
It could have happened.	Jista’ jkun ġara.
I thought it was there.	Kont naħseb li kien hemm.
Look around for it.	Ħares madwar għalih.
That was where it started.	Li kien fejn beda.
There is something out there.	Hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
This is what can happen.	Dan huwa dak li jista 'jiġri.
It will not work again.	Mhux se jerġa’ jaħdem.
It's not long.	Mhuwiex twil.
I like this too.	Jien inħobb dan ukoll.
Do more.	Għamel aktar.
We do now.	Nagħmlu issa.
You don’t have to tell me so.	M'għandekx għalfejn tgħidli hekk.
In fact just over there.	Fil-fatt eżatt fuq hemm.
But there was none of that.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn minn dan.
Not often, but not often.	Mhux ta’ spiss, imma mhux ta’ spiss.
It says what it is.	Jgħid dak li hu.
Now everything goes.	Issa kollox imur.
It was nothing like this.	Ma kien xejn bħal dan.
This is much better for you.	Dan huwa ħafna aħjar għalik.
But it is too much.	Imma huwa wisq.
They need another idea.	Għandhom bżonn idea oħra.
I have something to say.	Għandi xi ngħid.
Well, he sure is taking his.	Ukoll, huwa żgur li qed jieħu tiegħu.
They are always together.	Huma dejjem flimkien.
It wasn’t me.	Ma kontx jien.
I’m glad I saw both.	Jien kuntent li rajt it-tnejn.
You don’t have to be.	M'għandekx għalfejn tkun.
It could be anyone.	Jista’ jkun xi ħadd.
I see another.	Nara ieħor.
I really enjoy talking to you.	Inħobb ħafna nitkellem miegħek.
You want to talk.	Trid titkellem.
Let me talk a little about it.	Ħa nitkellem ftit dwarha.
And, after all, it does well.	U, wara kollox, tagħmel tajjeb.
To do properly.	Li jagħmel kif suppost.
It’s hard sometimes.	Huwa diffiċli xi drabi.
Now there is another thing.	Issa hemm ħaġa oħra.
This is someone else.	Dan huwa xi ħadd ieħor.
But it takes too much time.	Imma jieħu wisq ħin.
It has never come so far.	Qatt ma wasal daqshekk.
But you can tell me anything you want.	Imma tista’ tgħidli kull ħaġa li trid.
This can be good or bad.	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb jew ħażin.
He knew he could have it.	Kien jaf li seta’ jkollu.
But he knows things.	Imma jaf l-affarijiet.
She did it.	Hija għamlet dan.
And here's one.	U hawn wieħed.
This will be the first time.	Din tkun l-ewwel darba.
Not too late for you.	Mhux tard wisq għalik.
It had come to pass.	Huwa kien ħareġ jiġri.
He couldn't think so.	Ma setax jaħseb hekk.
I can’t say why.	Ma nistax ngħid għaliex.
Try to leave early.	Jipprova jitlaq kmieni.
It will not help.	Mhux se jgħin.
It’s too early, now.	Għadu kmieni wisq, issa.
Do you know where she is? 	Taf fejn hi?
.	.
So he wanted.	Hekk ried.
She knew he wasn’t going to say anything.	Kienet taf li ma kien se jgħid xejn.
That was a good way to do it.	Dak kien mod tajjeb biex tagħmel dan.
I probably shouldn’t be talking about it.	Probabbilment m'għandix inkun qed nitkellem dwarha.
But she knew she had to eat.	Imma kienet taf li kellha tiekol.
So it looks from the outside.	Hekk tidher minn barra.
I think there is not much you can do.	Naħseb li m'hemm xejn ħafna li tista 'tagħmel.
He seemed so glad.	Huwa deher daqshekk ferħan.
And we do it together.	U nagħmlu dan flimkien.
And maybe there’s nothing over there.	U forsi m'hemm xejn hemm fuq.
We will do that.	Aħna ser nagħmlu dan.
Let me wait and see.	Ħa nistenna u nara.
I understand why she did so.	Nifhem għaliex hi għamlet hekk.
Dik, dik.	Dik, dik.
I wasn’t very good at it.	Jien ma tantx kont tajjeb.
She had a man do it.	Kellha raġel jagħmel dan.
I know they are right.	Naf li għandhom raġun.
And so it was.	U kien hekk.
I’m sure it’s the same one every time.	Jien ċert li huwa l-istess waħda kull darba.
It’s too hard for you.	Huwa diffiċli wisq għalik.
Everything about her seemed tired.	Kollox dwarha deher għajjien.
The last man died here.	L-aħħar raġel miet hawn.
What happened.	X'ġara.
There would usually be no problem.	Normalment ma kien ikun hemm l-ebda problema.
I am only one person.	Jiena biss persuna waħda.
I need to see how he plays.	Ikolli bżonn nara kif jilgħab.
It’s not my idea.	Mhix idea tiegħi.
Soon we are making out.	Dalwaqt qed nagħmlu barra.
This can work as well.	Dan jista 'jaħdem ukoll.
And so it is with you.	U hekk huwa miegħek.
What happens.	Dak li jiġri.
I do something wrong.	Nagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina.
Well, better.	Ukoll, aħjar.
I will definitely do this again.	Żgur li se nerġa' nagħmel dan.
It's just not the same.	Huwa biss mhux l-istess.
She had an idea.	Kellha idea.
He says come on and you’re coming.	Jgħid ejja u int ġej.
I really want to know.	Verament irrid inkun naf.
It seems so now.	Jidher li issa ilu.
She must have heard enough.	Hija trid smajt biżżejjed.
I wasn’t going home.	Jien ma kontx immur id-dar.
It happens to happen.	Jiġri biex jiġri.
He had many lovers as well.	Kellu ħafna min iħobb ukoll.
Some easy problems.	Xi problemi faċli.
No one died.	Ħadd ma miet.
Everything about everything.	Kollox dwar kollox.
I was afraid of you.	Kont nibża' inti.
I hope someone can help.	Nispera li xi ħadd jista 'jgħin.
Another friend who lived there passed away.	Ħabib ieħor li kien jgħix hemm għadda.
Not so long ago either, for you.	Mhux daqshekk twil ilu lanqas, għalik.
He knew he wasn’t going to.	Kien jaf li ma kienx se.
He should be able to get there.	Għandu jkun kapaċi jasal hemm.
I want to talk about it now.	Irrid nitkellem dwarha issa.
It's just work.	Huwa biss xogħol.
It wasn’t quite noon.	Ma kienx pjuttost nofsinhar.
And now they have to.	U issa għandhom.
He will be fine.	Hu se jkun tajjeb.
That was just one man.	Dak kien raġel wieħed biss.
But there it was.	Imma kien hemm.
No one is home.	Ħadd ma d-dar.
We have to do this.	Irridu nagħmlu dan.
Which is a good thing.	Li hija ħaġa tajba.
I really have no idea from here.	Verament m'għandi l-ebda idea minn hawn.
It can be anything.	Jista’ jkun kollox.
What is so scary.	Dak li tant jibża.
But that was good for me.	Imma dan kien tajjeb għalija.
Or rather, you were right.	Jew aħjar, kellek raġun.
You had to know.	Kellek tkun taf.
We did things.	Aħna għamilna l-affarijiet.
More on that later.	Aktar dwar dan aktar tard.
Time is everything.	Iż-żmien huwa kollox.
He almost lost his job.	Kważi tilef ix-xogħol tiegħu.
But it had to be.	Imma kellu jkun.
Well, almost alone.	Ukoll, kważi waħdu.
I'm the one who knows.	Jien li nafu.
Well, this is too late.	Ukoll, dan huwa tard wisq.
We will not.	Aħna mhux se.
Well, obviously it will.	Ukoll, ovvjament se.
Someone to see.	Xi ħadd biex jara.
For many people, work is work.	Għal ħafna nies, ix-xogħol huwa xogħol.
You may never want something to say.	Inti qatt ma tista 'tixtieq xi ħaġa li tgħid.
I know, you want something more.	Naf, inti tixtieq xi ħaġa aktar.
But lately, he’s been coming to me.	Imma dan l-aħħar, kien qed jasal għandi.
That, of course, is wrong.	Dak, żgur, huwa ħażin.
There must be something you can do if it happens.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ħaġa li tista 'tagħmel jekk jiġri.
I love being a man.	Inħobb inkun raġel.
It was here.	Kien hawn.
I had everything and everything was not enough.	Jien kelli kollox u kollox ma kienx biżżejjed.
It’s something, it’s everything.	Hija xi ħaġa, hija kollox.
But come on.	Imma ejja.
Sure, someone definitely did.	Żgur, xi ħadd żgur għamel dan.
He had done what he had to do.	Huwa kien għamel dak li kellu jagħmel.
Probably something else.	Probabbilment xi ħaġa oħra.
Have fun together.	Tieħu gost flimkien.
But maybe it was more than that.	Imma forsi kien aktar minn hekk.
It’s better than what we had.	Huwa aħjar minn dak li kellna.
In fact, we know.	Fil-fatt, nafu.
And he died soon after.	U miet ftit wara.
I can tell you one thing.	Nista’ ngħidlek ħaġa waħda.
And they do.	U jagħmlu dan.
It would be good.	Ikun tajjeb.
He can live.	Jista’ jgħix.
She knew nothing.	Ma kienet taf xejn.
One and ready.	Wieħed u lest.
It looked good.	Deher tajjeb.
Maybe they need time alone with you.	Forsi għandhom bżonn ħin waħdu miegħek.
He asked for another.	Talab ieħor.
Or, or, or.	Jew, jew, jew.
I said, good job.	għidt, xogħol tajjeb.
No one had come.	Ħadd ma kien daħal.
It gets better and everything is fine.	Jiġi aħjar u kollox ikun tajjeb.
No one ever asked about it.	Ħadd qatt ma staqsa dwarha.
He said for sure.	Huwa qal żgur.
It was always so for him.	Dejjem kien hekk għalih.
You said everything before.	Inti għidt kollox qabel.
Someone will probably have to go.	Xi ħadd probabbilment ikollu jmur.
I saw each.	Rajt kull.
I couldn’t speak.	Ma stajtx nitkellem.
I came back home.	Ġejt lura d-dar.
I wonder how much.	Nistaqsi kemm.
No one else did that.	Ħadd ieħor ma għamel hekk.
What we have to do is not what we always do.	Dak li għandna nagħmlu mhuwiex dak li dejjem nagħmlu.
That’s as far as he was willing to go.	Dak sa fejn kien lest li jasal.
Everything will be fine.	Kollox se jkun tajjeb.
But you can be right.	Imma tista’ tkun raġun.
And this will not happen.	U dan mhux se jiġri.
He wanted to leave.	Ried jitlaq.
But there is more there now.	Imma hemm aktar hemm issa.
Monday is not good for me.	It-Tnejn mhu tajjeb għalija.
I'm not coming back.	Jien mhux ġej lura.
I think otherwise.	Naħseb mod ieħor.
I think or it works.	Naħseb jew jaħdem.
They are too fast.	Huma malajr wisq.
But he was not yet a child.	Imma ma kienx għadu tifel.
I’m nothing for you.	Jien m'iniex xejn għalik.
I'm here for you.	Jien hawn għalik.
It will be good.	Se jkun tajjeb.
This will help everyone.	Dan se jkun ta’ għajnuna għal kulħadd.
It wasn’t a happy time for me.	Ma kienx żmien kuntent għalija.
No way, he says.	L-ebda mod, jgħid.
One is obviously a very bad job.	Wieħed huwa ovvjament xogħol ħażin ħafna.
Not even a little good.	Lanqas ftit tajjeb.
Okay, again.	Tajjeb, darba oħra.
But only a few.	Imma ftit biss.
He had been here too long already.	Huwa kien ilu hawn wisq żmien diġà.
This is a great idea.	Din hija idea kbira.
He left.	Huwa telaq.
You can say that if you want.	Tista 'tgħid li jekk tixtieq.
We’ve been there for quite some time.	Konna hemm għal żmien mhux ħażin.
This is now my home.	Din issa hija d-dar tiegħi.
And here she was, just watching.	U hawn hi kienet, biss tara.
She is still around.	Hija għadha madwar.
I know you talk to him.	Naf li titkellem miegħu.
I always wonder.	Jien dejjem nistaqsi.
I know he does.	Naf li jagħmel.
I would.	Nixtieq .
They’re pretty right, of course.	Huma pjuttost raġun, ovvjament.
He can win.	Jista’ jirbaħ.
You know what you want to do and why.	Taf xi trid tagħmel u għaliex.
All right.	Kollox tajjeb.
They are making a lot more money than you.	Huma qed jagħmlu ħafna aktar flus milli int.
Now he is.	Issa hu.
That’s all we have.	Huwa dak kollu li għandna.
I'm going.	Sejjer sejjer.
I have never had such a problem before.	Qatt ma kelli problema bħal din qabel.
And this is not difficult.	U dan mhux diffiċli.
It was never too late.	Qatt ma kienet tard.
He is the only one.	Hu l-uniku wieħed.
I will be a man.	Jien se nkun raġel.
And in the morning.	U filgħodu.
I was like that too.	Jien kont hekk ukoll.
It’s a good thing she did.	Hija ħaġa tajba li għamlet.
I can’t just tell you.	Ma nistax ngħidlek biss.
It is working properly.	Qed jaħdem kif suppost.
All this will do.	Dak kollu dan se jagħmel.
I had to be more.	I kellha tkun aktar.
And you would be right.	U int tkun raġun.
This could be something else.	Din tista’ tkun xi ħaġa oħra.
It’s nothing to me.	Hi xejn għalija.
Loved talking.	Iħobb jitkellem.
That was his thing.	Dik kienet ħaġa tiegħu.
He had to do something.	Kellu jagħmel xi ħaġa.
He said nothing about where he was going.	Ma qal xejn dwar fejn kien sejjer.
It won’t be bad after that.	Mhux se jkun ħażin wara dak.
She had the same problem.	Kellha l-istess problema.
But what had happened had happened.	Imma dak li ġara kien ġara.
More than once, in fact.	Aktar minn darba, fil-fatt.
Does anyone have any idea about this ?.	Xi ħadd għandu xi idea dwar dan?.
You never know when.	Qatt ma tkun taf meta.
Not about that.	Mhux dwar dan.
I thought how would you like to know.	Ħsibt kif tixtieq tkun taf.
I can't see this.	Ma nistax nara dan.
He can see.	Huwa jista 'jara.
I usually do something else.	Normalment nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
Everything was still.	Kollox kien għadu.
I can only imagine what happened next.	Nista’ naħseb x’ġara wara.
I won’t wait any longer.	Mhux se nistenna aktar.
For many years.	Għal ħafna snin.
But it doesn’t have to.	Imma m'għandux għalfejn.
I was willing to do anything.	Kont lest li nagħmel għal kollox.
Probably did.	Probabbilment għamlet.
Come on, there’s better.	Ejja, hemm aħjar.
It was me, just me.	Kont jien, jien biss.
I hear once.	Nisma darba.
It would come, for sure.	Kien jiġi, żgur.
He is not ready.	Huwa mhux lest.
You've done more.	Inti stajt tagħmel aktar.
And it's wrong.	U huwa ħażin.
If there was.	Jekk kien hemm.
I have never seen this before.	Qatt ma rajt dan qabel.
He had tried this.	Huwa kien ipprova dan.
If anything, more will happen.	Jekk xejn, jiġri aktar.
But he wasted no time.	Imma ma tilef l-ebda ħin.
I didn’t want you to know the truth.	Ma ridtx li tkun taf il-verità.
I can’t say enough.	Ma nistax ngħid biżżejjed.
And not good.	U mhux tajjeb.
He has just returned.	Huwa għadu kif ġie lura.
He really came on.	Huwa verament daħal fuq.
And you really can't.	U int verament ma tistax.
I want to think about it.	Nixtieq naħseb dwarha.
I agreed.	Jien qabel.
said another.	qal ieħor.
Almost no one lived there.	Kważi ħadd kien jgħix hemmhekk.
He will go when he can.	Għadu jmur meta jista’.
It will take longer.	Se tieħu aktar.
That's not me.	Dak mhux jien.
You see, we now know each other.	Tara, issa nafu lil xulxin.
It's pretty bad.	Huwa pjuttost ħażin.
This really works.	Dan tassew jaħdem.
No one had come in or out.	Ħadd ma kien daħal jew ħareġ.
I’m not saying anything.	Jien ma ngħid xejn.
We will be.	Aħna se nkunu.
All of them.	Kollha kemm huma.
I thought she is.	Ħsibt li hi.
They happen.	Dawn jiġri.
Or maybe before.	Jew forsi qabel.
I will not understand.	Jien mhux se nifhem.
Wearing, it felt better.	Liebes, ħassu aħjar.
How to be good.	Kif tkun tajjeb.
But you can never tell.	Imma qatt ma tista’ tgħid.
Besides, he wouldn’t be alone.	Barra minn hekk, ma kienx ikun waħdu.
But he knew what to do.	Imma kien jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
Everything was fine.	Kollox kien tajjeb.
Everything looks good.	Kollox jidher tajjeb.
Or maybe I am.	Jew forsi jien.
One can see that.	Wieħed jista 'jara li.
He started but said nothing.	Beda imma ma qal xejn.
We only know that they are.	Nafu biss li huma.
I want these.	Irrid dawn.
I’m just the same.	Jien eżatt l-istess.
He did what he knew.	Huwa għamel dak li jaf.
It's there.	Huwa hemmhekk.
I have no idea why this is.	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex dan hu.
What he wanted he could not have.	Dak li ried ma setax ikollu.
He is small and can have a lot of money.	Huwa żgħir u jista 'jkollu ħafna flus.
No one had, of course.	Ħadd ma kellu, ovvjament.
Nothing here.	Xejn hawn.
There was no one else there.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor hemmhekk.
It's about something.	Huwa dwar xi ħaġa.
I just see everything.	Biss nara kollox.
It's bad.	Huwa ħażin.
I had to know.	I kellha naf.
He couldn’t have more.	Ma setax ikollu aktar.
I didn’t have to wait.	Ma kellix għalfejn nistenna.
Everything went well.	Kollox mar tajjeb.
I believe this is wrong.	Nemmen li dan huwa ħażin.
Tomorrow will be better.	Għada se jkun aħjar.
Look around the house quickly.	Ħares madwar id-dar malajr.
And look at a few things first.	U ħares lejn ftit affarijiet l-ewwel.
But everything is wrong.	Imma kollox huwa ħażin.
I don’t want to think about it.	Ma rridx naħseb dwarha.
It's all ready.	Huwa kollox lest.
Maybe not tomorrow or tomorrow, but someday.	Forsi mhux għada jew għada, imma xi darba.
Had we had more time.	Kieku kellna aktar ħin.
I had a really hard time.	Kelli żmien tassew diffiċli.
It shouldn’t be long now.	M'għandux ikun twil issa.
I think this is great.	Naħseb li dan huwa kbir.
It has everything right.	Għandu dak kollu tajjeb.
I want this.	Jien irrid din .
I can go back another time.	Nista’ nerġa’ lura xi żmien ieħor.
I hear that from many.	Nisma’ hekk minn ħafna.
That’s not all yet.	Dan għadu mhux kollox.
It was beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa.
I think you haven’t been there yet.	Naħseb li għadek ma kontx hemm.
He will eat everyone there.	Hu se jiekol lil kulħadd hemmhekk.
You can't tell that to anyone.	Inti ma tistax tgħid dan lil ħadd.
I'm sure you know that.	Jien ċert li taf li.
That was good for me.	Dan kien tajjeb lili.
It’s good, he said.	Huwa tajjeb, huwa qal.
I did all this.	Għamilt dan kollu.
But there is one.	Imma hemm wieħed.
Not much help from anyone.	Mhux ħafna għajnuna minn ħadd.
That was good.	Dak kien tajjeb.
I hope you like to stay here.	Nispera li tixtieq toqgħod hawn.
Neither do I.	Jien lanqas.
There’s nothing she can say, either.	M'hemm xejn hi tista 'tgħid, lanqas.
Not out takes a good time.	Mhux barra tieħu ħin tajjeb.
He just knows it happened.	Jaf biss li ġara.
If anything, it was great.	Jekk xejn, kien tajjeb ħafna.
You may know.	Tista' tkun taf.
We know more.	Nafu aktar.
I'm worried for you.	Jien inkwetat għalik.
In fact he said very little about it.	Fil-fatt ftit li xejn qal dwarha.
South, more or less.	Nofsinhar, xi ftit jew wisq.
If it were me, it would be me.	Kieku kienu jien, kieku jien.
He knows what that is.	Jaf x'inhu dak.
So we did a long time ago.	Hekk għamilna żmien ilu.
It could be someone who passed.	Jista 'jkun xi ħadd li għadda.
They are doing the same thing.	Huma qed jagħmlu l-istess ħaġa.
And there is only one way to do that.	U hemm mod wieħed biss biex tagħmel dan.
After a year.	Wara sena.
Maybe it’s something else.	Forsi hija xi ħaġa oħra.
Obviously someone would be interested.	Ovvjament xi ħadd ikun interessat.
Not all the time, but it happened.	Mhux il-ħin kollu, imma ġara.
And, every morning after that.	U, kull filgħodu wara dak.
I wasn’t so surprised.	Ma kontx daqshekk sorpriż.
Before it was never really like that.	Qabel qatt ma kien verament hekk.
Someone wants to know something.	Xi ħadd irid ikun jaf xi ħaġa.
For a long time, she didn’t know.	Għal żmien twil, ma kinitx taf.
Now is the time.	Issa wasal iż-żmien.
He said he was not.	Qal li ma kienx.
That was almost a year ago.	Dak kien kważi sena ilu.
But there is nothing.	Imma m'hemm xejn.
He was so much.	Huwa kien daqshekk ħafna.
No one knows where you are right now.	Ħadd ma jaf fejn int bħalissa.
I think you do too.	Naħseb li tagħmel ukoll.
He didn't know what was going on around him.	Ma kienx jaf x’kien hemm madwar.
She was around forever.	Hija kienet madwar għal dejjem.
You made your home.	Għamilt id-dar tiegħek.
This actually happened to me.	Dan fil-fatt ġara lili.
I say this all the time.	Jien ngħid dan il-ħin kollu.
She will be there.	Hi se tkun hemm.
He was tired, more tired than he was.	Kien għajjien, aktar għajjien milli kien.
I was definitely fine.	Żgur li kont tajjeb.
This is really happening.	Dan qed jiġri tassew.
To be really ready.	Biex tkun tassew lest.
I’ve been there for you all this time.	Jien kont hemm għalik dan iż-żmien kollu.
I did very little.	Ma tantx għamilt xejn.
Most people are.	Ħafna nies huma.
That’s where it goes.	Dak hu fejn imur.
Whatever was happening, it was.	Kien x’kien qed jiġri, kien hekk.
Maybe there was nothing.	Forsi ma kien hemm xejn.
Or you, of course.	Jew int, ovvjament.
And there was something else.	U kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
For a while it says nothing.	Għal xi żmien ma tgħid xejn.
I'm having problems with this.	Qed ikolli problemi b'dan.
But now it’s time to go home.	Imma issa wasal iż-żmien li tmur id-dar.
Come on.	Ejja fuq.
He doesn’t want to talk about it.	Ma jridx jitkellem dwarha.
It’s not so late yet.	Għadu mhux daqshekk tard.
Nor can it be otherwise.	Lanqas ma jista’ jkun mod ieħor.
That, that, that he didn’t know.	Dak, dak, dak ma kienx jaf.
Maybe we are.	Forsi aħna.
I know you think.	Naf li taħseb.
He didn't expect it to last long.	Ma kienx jistenna li jibqa’ twil.
But here you have to be.	Imma hawn trid tkun.
It would be good to be home.	Ikun tajjeb li tkun id-dar.
I doubt you ever will.	Niddubita li inti qatt se.
He had done this before.	Huwa kien għamel dan qabel.
Everything looks good to me.	Kollox jidher tajjeb għalija.
He seems scared.	Jidher jibża.
How? 	Kif?
You can't go wrong with this one.	Inti ma tistax tmur ħażin ma 'dan wieħed.
I couldn’t understand.	Ma stajtx nifhem.
It couldn’t be happening.	Ma setax ikun qed jiġri.
Not me.	Mhux jien .
You knew that before you came.	Int taf hekk qabel ma ġejt.
And he is with you.	U hu miegħek.
Now they have it.	Issa għandhom dan.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.	Xejn bħal dan qatt ma ġara qabel.
She will do both.	Hija se tagħmel it-tnejn.
Not fast enough, sure.	Mhux malajr biżżejjed, żgur.
He was a big boy.	Kien tifel kbir.
They do no work.	Huma ma jagħmlu l-ebda xogħol.
Let's go back to the room.	Ejja mmorru lura fil-kamra.
That’s not how it works here.	Dak mhux kif jaħdem hawn.
Back, back, back.	Lura, lura, lura.
Earlier than tomorrow.	Aktar kmieni milli għada.
Obviously it was good.	Ovvjament kien tajjeb.
More than he expected or wanted.	Aktar milli kien jistenna jew ried.
No, it's not happening.	Le, mhux qed jiġri.
Almost too easy.	Kważi faċli wisq.
It was she who did so.	Kienet hi li għamlet hekk.
I never am.	Jien qatt ma jien.
This was done.	Dan sar.
It's so bad.	Huwa daqshekk ħażin.
I never wanted to be like that.	Qatt ma ridt inkun hekk.
Your home is beautiful.	Id-dar tiegħek hija sabiħa.
I didn’t even know.	Lanqas kont naf.
Being happy is great.	Li tkun kuntent huwa kbir.
This is very big.	Dan huwa kbir ħafna.
It's not a job.	Mhuwiex xogħol.
Someone else knows why you can't.	Xi ħadd ieħor ikun jaf għaliex ma tistax.
It's too fast.	Huwa malajr wisq.
Bad thing, my little friend.	Ħaġa ħażina, ħabib żgħir tiegħi.
Nothing is there, but everything is there.	Xejn m'hemm, imma kollox hemm.
He didn't know anyone.	Ma kien jaf lil ħadd.
But he can't drive.	Imma ma jistax isuq.
I am very happy to be with you today.	Jien kuntent ħafna li nkun miegħek illum.
She’s with you, I’m sure.	Hija miegħek, jien ċert.
That was three years ago and now.	Dak kien tliet snin ilu u issa.
I thought we would have a good time.	Ħsibt li se nagħmlu ħin tajjeb.
Nothing will ever be good again.	Xejn qatt mhu se jerġa’ jkun tajjeb.
They are just.	Huma biss.
I would never have suspected anything of this otherwise.	Jien qatt ma kont nissuspetta xi ħaġa minn dan mod ieħor.
I can’t be like that again.	Ma nistax inkun hekk mill-ġdid.
You have everything he has now.	Int dak kollu li għandu issa.
Soon it was all over.	Dalwaqt kien kollu.
It looks good and will be good.	Jidher tajjeb u jkun tajjeb.
It was never there.	Qatt ma kien hemm.
Everyone is doing a job.	Kulħadd huwa xogħol li qed isir.
Everything is happening right now.	Dak kollu li qed jiġri bħalissa.
But they are more than that.	Imma huma aktar minn hekk.
Well, maybe a little bit.	Ukoll, forsi ftit ftit.
And today, the truth is still beautiful.	U llum, il-verità għadha sabiħa.
It's pretty hard.	Huwa pjuttost diffiċli.
And yours.	U tiegħek.
They are just too fast.	Huma ftit wisq malajr.
I want this.	Irrid dan.
And he is right about that.	U għandu raġun dwar dan.
No one he knew would say.	Ħadd li kien jaf ma kien jgħid.
I want to try to do it myself.	Irrid nipprova nagħmel jien.
It wasn’t about what I did.	Ma kienx dwar dak li għamilt.
There must be a lot.	Għandu jkun hemm ħafna.
I don’t think anything.	Jien ma naħseb xejn.
No one was up and out.	Ħadd ma kien sa u barra.
He always did exactly as he said.	Dejjem għamel eżatt kif qal.
I went back with him about a year ago.	Mort lura miegħu madwar sena ilu.
If she wasn’t happy, so was she.	Jekk ma kienx kuntent, hekk kienet hi.
I wish everyone.	Nixtieq li kulħadd.
This is what came out.	Dan huwa dak li ħareġ.
I’m sure it will never happen.	Jien ċert li qatt mhu se jiġri.
There was a lot of that.	Kien hemm ħafna minn dan.
That's how it should be.	Dak kif għandu jkun.
I think this is a great idea.	Naħseb li din hija idea kbira.
He said he would stay on.	Huwa qal li kien jibqa 'fuq.
You will be just like this.	Inti se tkun eżatt bħal dan.
Now he’s just doing things.	Issa qed tagħmel l-affarijiet biss.
And if he doesn’t, he should.	U jekk ma jagħmilx hekk, għandu.
I was doing so well.	Kont sejjer hekk tajjeb.
I want you to always be happy.	Irrid li tkun dejjem ferħan.
I like the house more like this actually.	Jien inħobb id-dar aktar bħal din fil-fatt.
I still believe it.	Għadni nemmen.
But he couldn’t help it.	Imma ma setax jgħin.
All well and good.	Dak kollu tajjeb u tajjeb.
But in fact it was so.	Imma fil-fatt kien hekk.
It would have been, when he was a child.	Kien ikun, meta kien tifel.
Don’t say such things.	M'għandekx tgħid affarijiet bħal dawn.
Today I made a friend.	Illum għamilt ħabib.
It's not working yet.	Għadu mhux qed jaħdem.
Good, better, better.	Tajjeb, aħjar, aħjar.
Maybe more than that.	Forsi aktar minn hekk.
They were there all the time.	Kienu hemm il-ħin kollu.
He never said it would be easy.	Qatt ma qal li jkun faċli.
He was the only one who came out.	Kien l-uniku wieħed li ħareġ.
The dog was scared.	Il-kelb kien jibża.
Maybe they need help.	Forsi għandhom bżonn l-għajnuna.
Well, nothing at the moment.	Ukoll, xejn bħalissa.
But not so much.	Imma mhux daqshekk hekk.
That’s not your job.	Dak mhux ix-xogħol tiegħek.
That was home.	Dik kienet id-dar.
It’s, above all, fast.	Huwa, fuq kollox, malajr.
His seems to be going on forever.	Tiegħu jidher li sejjer għal dejjem.
Now he knows what to do.	Issa jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
I may be too late.	I jista 'jkun tard wisq.
She was very beautiful.	Kienet sabiħa ħafna.
He just came out.	Huwa biss ħareġ.
I still can’t try.	Għadni ma nistax nipprova.
I could never stand back.	Qatt ma stajt noqgħod lura.
It looks great.	Huwa jidher kbir.
I hope it was good.	Nittama li kien tajjeb.
Something else is.	Xi ħaġa oħra hija.
You really don't.	Int verament ma.
He would not stay.	Ma kienx se jibqa’.
I eat a lot.	niekol ħafna.
And it still does now.	U għadu jagħmel issa.
Just like your every one does.	Eżatt bħal kull wieħed tiegħek jagħmel.
Well, she wasn't.	Ukoll, hija ma kinitx.
It will be very good.	Hija se tkun tajba ħafna.
I said it over and over again.	Għidt darba u oħra.
I came here to talk to come back.	Ġejt hawn biex nitkellem biex jiġi lura.
Obviously no one was.	Ovvjament ħadd ma kien.
But not so often.	Imma mhux daqshekk spiss.
And so do money.	U hekk tagħmel flus.
I don’t think I’m anyone.	Ma naħsibx li nkun xi ħadd.
That, of course, would be me.	Dan, ovvjament, inkun jien.
He knows he will have.	Jaf li se jkollu.
Now everyone is here.	Issa kulħadd qiegħed hawn.
For hours, maybe.	Għal sigħat, forsi.
You always have problems.	Dejjem għandek problemi.
She says let's.	Hi tgħid ejja.
I’m a very bad person.	Jien persuna ħażina ħafna.
This is not hard to see.	Dan mhux diffiċli biex tara.
This is not one.	Din mhix waħda.
Nothing good can happen.	Ma jista’ jiġri xejn tajjeb.
I'm sure you're right.	Jien ċert li għandek raġun.
He knows how it looks.	Hu jaf kif tidher.
Once upon a time, this would not have been difficult.	Darba, dan ma kienx ikun diffiċli.
I know he did.	Naf li hekk għamel.
That is all we need.	Dan huwa dak kollu li għandna bżonn.
I could do it.	Jien stajt nagħmel.
Well, it's good enough.	Ukoll, huwa tajjeb biżżejjed.
And it certainly wasn’t the last.	U żgur li ma kienx l-aħħar.
This was going to happen.	Dan kien se jiġri.
Not after what had happened here.	Mhux wara dak li kien ġara hawn.
There is nothing you need to do.	M'hemm xejn li għandek bżonn tagħmel.
Everyone is so easy.	Kulħadd huwa daqshekk faċli.
If done, better.	Jekk isir, aħjar.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Dik ma kinitx tkun xi ħaġa tajba.
Everything they really need.	Dak kollu li għandhom bżonn verament.
He was a man, after all.	Kien raġel, wara kollox.
Now say something.	Issa għid xi ħaġa.
Or maybe, it wasn’t like that.	Jew forsi, ma kienx hekk.
We’ve never had each other alone.	Aħna qatt kellna lil xulxin biss.
But there is one thing you must know.	Imma hemm ħaġa waħda li trid tkun taf.
I don’t know by whom.	Ma nafx minn min.
It happened really fast to me.	Ġara tassew malajr lili.
He is still here with us.	Għadu hawn magħna.
No, it couldn’t be.	Le, ma setax ikun.
He was wearing.	Kien liebes.
It will never happen again.	Qatt ma jerġa’ jkun hemm.
To no one.	Lil ħadd.
Never before had he felt so alone.	Qatt qabel ma kien ħassu daqshekk waħdu.
No, no, she says.	Le, le, tgħid hi.
You know what you want.	Taf li trid.
Maybe it was, a little.	Forsi kienet, ftit.
It could have been almost nothing.	Seta’ kien kważi xejn.
She will not eat.	Hi mhux se tiekol.
And so you have.	U hekk għandek.
Not like that.	Ma bħal dik.
I don't need yours.	M'għandix bżonn tiegħek.
This is working.	Dan qed jaħdem.
He had no money.	Ma kellux flus.
She wasn’t the only one.	Ma kinitx l-unika waħda.
It doesn’t have to be that way.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun hekk.
It was for someone else.	Kien għal xi ħadd ieħor.
You were busy at the time.	Int kont okkupat dak iż-żmien.
I'm afraid for you.	Nibża għalik.
Okay too, boy.	Tajjeb ukoll, tifel.
You just might be.	Tista 'biss tkun.
He had to do something.	Kellu jagħmel xi ħaġa.
That should be yours too.	Dak għandu jkun tiegħek ukoll.
Good and good.	Tajjeb u tajjeb.
But we can’t do that.	Imma ma nistgħux nagħmlu dan.
Everyone has one.	Kulħadd għandu wieħed.
Definitely I’ve been able to say something about it by now.	Żgur li stajt tgħid xi ħaġa dwarha sa issa.
But not for everyone.	Imma mhux għal kulħadd.
No, it's much more than that.	Le, huwa ħafna aktar minn hekk.
Just think.	Jaħseb biss.
I want friends, friend,.	Irrid ħbieb, ħabib, .
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx.
I loved this car.	Din il-karozza kont inħobb.
I should say.	Suppost ngħid.
I didn’t like school very much.	L-iskola ma tantx kont inħobb.
I think he’s a man.	Naħseb li huwa raġel.
Very surprised !.	Sorpriż ħafna!.
That’s what he’s thinking.	Dak hu li qed jaħseb.
You hardly want to know.	Ma tantx trid tkun taf.
As he knows.	Kif jaf hu.
Nothing was right.	Xejn ma kien tajjeb.
How was the door.	Kif kien il-bieb.
That had to be him.	Dan kellu jkun hu.
This happened once to my friend.	Dan ġara darba lil ħabib tiegħi.
Everything will happen.	Dak kollu se jiġri.
I hope this helps !.	Nittama li dan jgħin!.
Not bad either.	Lanqas ħażin.
I couldn’t either.	Jien ma stajtx lanqas.
That was a long time ago.	Dak kien twil ilu.
This didn’t even happen.	Dan lanqas ma ġara.
I do my best to do so.	Nagħmel minn kollox biex nagħmel hekk.
Well, it seemed so.	Ukoll, deher hekk.
She knows you're there.	Hija taf li int hemm.
They are nothing to me.	Huma xejn għalija.
I see it as difficult.	Nara li huwa diffiċli.
I like to think we are more, or better.	Inħobb naħseb li aħna aktar, jew aħjar.
This almost never happens.	Dan kważi qatt ma jiġri.
But no one else does.	Imma ħadd ieħor ma jagħmel.
I just want to be friends.	Irrid inkun ħbieb biss.
He speaks.	Huwa jitkellem.
First things first.	L-ewwel affarijiet l-ewwel.
Like, really something.	Bħal, tassew xi ħaġa.
This is happening now.	Dan qed jiġri issa.
This had to happen.	Dan kellu jiġri.
It was all there.	Kien hemm kollu.
Usually they are.	Normalment huma.
Not one thing.	Mhux ħaġa waħda.
To see.	Biex tara.
He thought back.	Huwa ħaseb lura.
That has never been done before.	Dak qatt ma sar qabel.
I believe he will survive.	Nemmen li se jgħix.
This was my first one.	Din kienet l-ewwel waħda tiegħi.
You don’t eat too much either.	Lanqas ma tiekol wisq.
It would happen a few times.	Kieku jiġri xi ftit drabi.
It just helps.	Huwa biss jgħin.
I was happy.	Kont kuntent.
But easy is not always good.	Imma faċli mhux dejjem ikun tajjeb.
Or don’t.	Jew ma tagħmilx.
I stand for you as you are.	Jien noqgħod għalik kif int.
We need to know what it is.	Irridu nkunu nafu x’inhu.
I saw it tonight.	Rajt illejla.
Well, she actually did.	Ukoll, hija fil-fatt għamlet dan.
Try it if you need to.	Ipprova jekk għandek bżonn.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
Well, he wasn’t going to do that.	Tajjeb, ma kienx se jagħmel hekk.
I wanted the job.	Ridt ix-xogħol.
But it was easier to settle.	Imma kien aktar faċli li toqgħod.
She is out alone.	Hi barra waħedha.
Much easier.	Ħafna aktar faċli.
I wasn’t like that.	Jien ma kontx hekk.
Now it was long gone.	Issa kien ilu li għadda.
Not just here.	Mhux hawn biss.
Just what we needed.	Biss dak li kellna bżonn.
I have no problem doing this.	M'għandi l-ebda problema nagħmel dan.
He can't see anything.	Ma jista’ jara xejn.
In fact, you could say wrong.	Fil-fatt tista’ tgħid ħażin.
Now let’s try.	Issa ejja nipprova.
Everything is so.	Kollox hu hekk.
I can't understand the problem.	Jien ma nistax nifhem il-problema.
Maybe it wasn’t.	Forsi ma kienx.
This can happen.	Dan jista 'jiġri.
Whatever it was, it wasn’t the truth.	Tkun xi tkun, ma kinitx il-verità.
Obviously, you say.	Ovvjament, tgħid.
She didn't know what to say.	Hija ma kinitx taf x'se tgħid.
They just aren’t for me.	Huma biss mhux għalija.
And once he was at work.	U darba kien fuq ix-xogħol.
You already are me.	Int diġà jien.
I never wanted a boy.	Qatt ma ridt tifel.
They were on a car.	Kienu fuq karozza.
I had one there.	Kelli waħda hemm.
We have a lot.	Għandna ħafna.
If it happens, she knows everything about it.	Jekk jiġri, hi taf kollox dwar dan.
And he comes back.	U hu ġej lura.
But she's not talking.	Imma hi mhux qed titkellem.
And it can be.	U jista 'jkun.
She knows this now.	Hija taf dan issa.
That's what you think.	Dak hu li taħseb.
If not, you don't.	Jekk le, inti ma.
He had said he would.	Huwa kien qal li kieku.
It's just me.	Jien biss jien.
There you are alone, here and now.	Hemm int biss, hawn u issa.
This is all great.	Dan kollu huwa kbir.
She wants to see.	Hija trid tara.
No, this cannot be.	Le, dan ma jistax ikun.
You are already here.	Int diġà qiegħed hawn.
It's out now.	Huwa barra issa.
No one seemed to be around.	Ħadd ma deher li kien madwar.
We want to do more than what works.	Irridu nagħmlu aktar minn dak li jaħdem.
I wanted that above all else.	Ridt li fuq kollox.
I have never seen this coming.	Qatt ma rajt dan ġej.
But not for too long.	Imma mhux għal żmien twil wisq.
I would never do that.	Jien qatt ma nkun qed nagħmel dan.
Not so.	Lanqas hekk.
This is obviously not good.	Dan ovvjament mhux tajjeb.
It is probably the first than the last.	Huwa x'aktarx l-ewwel milli l-aħħar.
Look like that.	Ħares hekk.
We did and so it was.	Għamilna u hekk kien.
It's too much to take.	Huwa wisq biex tieħu.
No one wants to play with us.	Ħadd ma jrid jilgħab magħna.
I was still.	Kont għadni.
Not so hard.	Mhux daqshekk diffiċli.
Probably more than you have.	Probabbilment aktar milli għandek.
This was not the time.	Dan ma kienx iż-żmien.
Most of these.	Ħafna minn dawn.
I understand a little.	Nifhem ftit.
I don’t want you to go either.	Ma rridx li inti tmur lanqas.
There will always be a better time, later.	Dejjem ikun hemm żmien aħjar, aktar tard.
You will moreover.	Inti ser barra minn hekk.
It never comes.	Qatt ma jiġi.
This was the house.	Din kienet id-dar.
This makes things harder.	Dan jagħmel l-affarijiet aktar diffiċli.
In fact, he couldn’t wait to leave, either.	Fil-fatt, hu ma setax jistenna li jitlaq, lanqas.
I’m just telling my truth.	Jien biss ngħid il-verità tiegħi.
There had to be another year.	Kellu jkun hemm sena oħra.
One works, one does not.	Wieħed jaħdem, wieħed le.
But and you often know.	Imma u spiss taf.
Of course you can do whatever you want.	Ovvjament tista’ tagħmel dak kollu li tixtieq.
Now is the only time.	Issa huwa l-uniku ħin.
I always do that.	Jien dejjem nagħmel dan.
It is easy to make and easy to eat.	Huwa faċli li tagħmel u faċli biex tiekol.
He took to doing.	Huwa ħa tagħmel.
I never thought about it.	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwarha.
I was home.	Jien kont id-dar.
I do it every year.	Nagħmel kull sena.
He saw it all.	Huwa ra dan kollu.
He knows without knowing why.	Huwa jkun jaf mingħajr ma jkun jaf għaliex.
It's easy enough to do.	Huwa faċli biżżejjed li tagħmel.
But he can't.	Imma ma jistax.
I make time.	Nagħmel ħin.
There seems to be more.	Jidher li għandu jkun hemm aktar.
It was great.	Kien kbir.
Nor is all this yet.	Lanqas għadu dan kollu.
He doesn’t talk much.	Ma tantx titkellem.
And that was it now.	U dan kien issa.
It works pretty fast.	Jaħdem pjuttost malajr.
It was he who did it.	Kien hu li għamel.
That would be something.	Dik tkun xi ħaġa.
No more, my friends.	Mhux aktar, ħbieb tiegħi.
But no one came out.	Imma ħadd ma ħareġ.
I want to know the truth.	Irrid inkun naf il-verità.
I hope you are right.	Nispera li għandek raġun.
Try to be helpful.	Jipprova nkun ta' għajnuna.
I am eating well.	Qed niekol tajjeb.
You have no idea who she is.	M'għandekx idea min hi.
Now I could see.	Issa stajt nara.
Just being together.	Biss qed flimkien.
This can be time consuming.	Dan jista' jieħu ħafna ħin.
And everything was happening.	U dak kollu kien qed jiġri.
You can see this too.	Tista 'tara dan ukoll.
Not too late.	Mhux tard ħafna.
I can’t talk much enough.	Ma nistax nitkellem ħafna biżżejjed.
He does it all the time.	Huwa jagħmel dan il-ħin kollu.
Nice idea.	Idea sabiħa.
It seemed uncertain what he would do.	Deher mhux ċert x'se jagħmel.
Sometimes this is good and other times not.	Xi drabi dan huwa tajjeb u drabi oħra le.
Nobody really knew what it was.	Ħadd ma kien verament jaf x’kien.
He said this helps.	Qal li dan jgħin.
And you have been.	U ġejt.
It had to be there.	Kellu jkun hemm.
.	.
This house would be you.	Din id-dar tkun int.
Maybe that was because he didn’t know.	Forsi dan kien għaliex ma kienx jaf.
It must have been years ago.	Għandu jkun snin ilu.
Everyone was busy doing something.	Kulħadd kien okkupat jagħmel xi ħaġa.
And so it was.	U hekk kien hu.
I really am.	Jien tassew.
It was too much.	Kien wisq.
It can go.	Jista’ jmur.
This is often a good thing.	Ħafna drabi din hija ħaġa tajba.
Where did everything go wrong? 	Fejn mar kollox ħażin?
No more.	Mhux aktar.
Now we go home soon.	Issa mmorru d-dar dalwaqt.
I understand your problem.	Nifhem il-problema tiegħek.
And it never will.	U qatt ma se.
But the time had not come.	Imma ma kienx wasal iż-żmien.
I suspect it wasn’t.	Nissuspetta li ma kienx.
I couldn’t think of anything to say.	Ma stajt naħseb xejn xi ngħid.
Everyone knows.	Kulħadd ikun jaf.
Why no one knows.	Għaliex ħadd ma jaf.
As she is.	Kif hi.
It was the truth.	Kienet il-verità.
But it happened so fast.	Imma ġara daqshekk malajr.
To each, his.	Lil kull wieħed, tiegħu.
This looked like a very long time ago.	Dan deher qisu żmien twil ħafna ilu.
I just don't know that.	I biss ma nafx li.
No way.	L-ebda mod.
They seem to do nothing.	Jidher li ma jagħmlu xejn.
I never do that now.	Qatt ma nagħmel hekk issa.
No one wants to say for sure.	Ħadd ma jrid jgħid żgur.
You have to go.	Trid tmur.
It may be none of these things.	Jista 'jkun l-ebda waħda minn dawn l-affarijiet.
It was probably a year after it came out.	Probabbilment kienet sena wara li ħareġ.
And it was wrong.	U kien ħażin.
Nothing will ever be enough.	Xejn qatt ma jkun biżżejjed.
In fact, there is no money.	Fil-fatt, m'hemm l-ebda flus.
I was worried.	Kont inkwetat.
And it needs to be.	U jeħtieġ li jkun.
He had to take what he could.	Kellu jieħu dak li seta’ jieħu.
I had never been there before.	Qatt ma kont hemm qabel.
Everyone will be the same, and everyone will be happy.	Kulħadd ikun l-istess, u kulħadd ikun kuntent.
And that wasn’t mine either.	U dan ma kienx tiegħi lanqas.
I’m not doing anything wrong.	Jien ma nagħmel xejn ħażin.
Usually something he didn’t want to do.	Normalment xi ħaġa li ma riedx jagħmel.
I have no idea.	M'għandi l-ebda idea.
Not coming.	Mhux ġej.
And you know who said that.	U taf min qal hekk.
I was pretty sure he was a man.	Kont pjuttost ċert li kien raġel.
And he really wanted it.	U verament ried dan.
It can go for almost anything and still work.	Jista 'jmur għal kważi xejn u għadu jaħdem.
And he went out to see.	U ħareġ jara.
Not that she will be able to for a long time.	Mhux li hi se tkun kapaċi għal żmien twil.
I was so surprised.	Kont tant sorpriż.
And that was great.	U dan kien kbir.
More and more, more is more.	Aktar u aktar, aktar huwa aktar.
I have to talk to you.	Jien għandi nitkellem miegħek.
And now they were together.	U issa kienu flimkien.
Something was worried.	Xi ħaġa kienet inkwetat.
He is a man who has a lot to say.	Huwa raġel li għandu ħafna xi jgħid.
This is your school.	Din hija l-iskola tiegħek.
Its nothing.	Mhu xejn tiegħu.
It's so good.	Huwa daqshekk tajjeb.
Only now it was too late.	Biss issa kien tard wisq.
It looks good.	Jidher li huwa tajjeb.
It never was.	Qatt ma kien.
As we always have.	Hekk kif dejjem għandna.
Probably always.	X'aktarx dejjem.
It is now or never.	Huwa issa jew qatt.
All or nothing.	Kollox jew xejn.
But you come with me.	Imma int ġej miegħi.
He won’t be here another three hours.	Mhux se jasal hawn tliet sigħat oħra.
That wasn’t so long ago.	Dan ma kienx daqshekk twil ilu.
He came here first.	Huwa wasal hawn l-ewwel.
Wrong is wrong.	Ħażin huwa ħażin.
Not so much.	Mhux daqshekk.
You must go now.	Trid tmur issa.
It came back to me pretty quickly.	Ġie lura għandi pjuttost malajr.
But he saw none of all that.	Imma hu ma ra xejn minn dak kollu.
But it’s not happening tomorrow.	Imma mhux qed jiġri għada.
And he knows it was bad too.	U jaf li kien ħażin ukoll.
I will be with you.	Jien inkun miegħek.
And it will stay that way for a while.	U jibqa’ hekk għal xi żmien.
She was thinking something.	Hija kienet taħseb xi ħaġa.
And it will never be again.	U qatt mhu se jerġa’ jkun.
It was so good.	Kien hekk tajjeb.
This has to be.	Dan irid ikun.
And so it happened.	U hekk ġara.
Well, not so small anymore.	Ukoll, mhux daqshekk żgħir aktar.
That’s great.	Dak hu kbir.
Well, that was that.	Ukoll, dak kien dak.
I take everything and everything else.	Jien nieħu dak kollu u kull ħaġa oħra.
You can’t eat everything.	Ma tistax tiekol kollox.
I'm afraid not.	Nibża li le.
.	.
But he wasn’t going to do it tonight.	Imma ma kienx se jagħmel dan illejla.
She was as good as ever.	Kienet tajba daqs qatt qabel.
He says he knows nothing about it.	Jgħid li ma jaf xejn dwarha.
Without asking too much.	Mingħajr ma nistaqsi wisq.
It’s just a very difficult time right now.	Huwa biss żmien diffiċli ħafna bħalissa.
He will already be scared.	Huwa diġà se jkun qed jibża’.
It wasn’t, and that you must not do so.	Ma kienx, u li trid ma tagħmilx hekk.
This she did.	Dan hi għamlet.
Never, ever do I do that to anyone.	Qatt, qatt ma nagħmel hekk lil xi ħadd.
That's mine.	Dak hu tiegħi.
Not just a good idea.	Mhix biss idea tajba.
She needed to be alone.	Hija kellha bżonn tkun waħedha.
He always stays with me.	Dejjem jibqa’ miegħi.
There is nothing wrong with you.	M'hemm xejn ħażin miegħek.
They sure are both.	Huma żgur kemm huma.
It would not be difficult.	Ma jkunx diffiċli.
You can do that too.	Tista 'tagħmel dan ukoll.
She is as good as everyone else.	Hija tajba daqs kulħadd.
Here you are.	Hawn int.
They were all over.	Kienu kollha fuq.
.	.
This is much more difficult.	Dan huwa ħafna aktar diffiċli.
I couldn’t just sit there.	Jien ma stajtx biss noqgħod hemm.
No, she's good.	Le, hi tajba.
You don’t have to.	M'għandekx għalfejn.
I can't do anything.	Jien ma nista nagħmel xejn.
I don’t know why not.	Ma nafx għaliex le.
Wasn't that so? 	Ma kienx hekk?
He had never been before.	Hu qatt ma kien qabel.
And no one comes.	U ħadd ma jiġi.
I would like to know what it is.	Nixtieq inkun naf x'inhu.
What it actually was, was this.	Dak li fil-fatt kien, kien dan.
And it looks like she did.	U qisu hi għamlet.
That’s bad enough, and all he wants to know.	Dak huwa ħażin biżżejjed, u kull ma jrid ikun jaf.
I’m not sure why, everything looks good to me.	M'inix ċert għaliex, kollox jidher tajjeb għalija.
No one is happy about that.	Ħadd m'hu kuntent b'dan.
It really doesn't.	Huwa verament ma.
That’s very good.	Dak hu tajjeb ħafna.
Anyone could do that.	Kulħadd seta’ jagħmel dan.
Always so.	Dejjem hekk.
And this will happen.	U dan se jiġri.
And everyone knows.	U kulħadd jaf.
I like to eat well.	Inħobb niekol tajjeb.
It works very well.	Jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
It was very, very bad.	Kien ħażin ħafna ħafna.
I was so worried.	Kont tant inkwetat.
This was not so great.	Dan ma kienx daqshekk kbir.
It always will be.	Huwa dejjem se jkun.
But for everything that happens, it’s the first time.	Imma għal dak kollu li jiġri, hemm l-ewwel darba.
But it was beautiful.	Imma kienet sabiħa.
Also, what I did was not so bad.	Barra minn hekk, dak li għamilt ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
I didn’t know.	Jien ma kontx naf.
This happens very often.	Dan jiġri ħafna drabi.
I should be happy.	Għandi nkun kuntent.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Xejn, xejn, xejn.
There is always.	Dejjem hemm.
And it's easy to see why.	U huwa faċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
You don’t have to think about doing.	M'għandekx għalfejn taħseb li tagħmel.
Nothing about this is good, nothing.	Xejn dwar dan mhu tajjeb, xejn.
He needed that.	Huwa kellu bżonn dak.
Well you’re not the only one.	Ukoll int mhux l-uniku wieħed.
I am sure I will try this soon.	Jiena ċert li se nipprova dan dalwaqt.
She did that morning.	Hija għamlet dak filgħodu.
She knows a lot.	Hija taf ħafna.
He died shortly afterwards.	Huwa miet ftit wara.
She knew about both of them.	Kienet taf dwar it-tnejn li huma.
He knew for sure.	Huwa kien jaf li żgur.
If not more.	Jekk mhux aktar.
Not much is happening here.	Mhux qed jiġri ħafna hawn.
You will be very glad you did.	Int tkun ferħan ħafna li għamilt.
Few people do.	Ftit nies jagħmlu.
I would be interested to see how it goes.	Inkun interessat nara kif tmur.
Just please.	Jekk jogħġbok biss.
We will be here for you.	Aħna se nkunu hawn għalik.
That was big enough.	Dak kien kbir biżżejjed.
She had had enough.	Kellha biżżejjed.
We have a lot of problems.	Għandna ħafna problemi.
But you.	Imma int.
That’s not the way to do it.	Dak mhux mod kif tagħmel.
By then maybe I’ll know more.	Sa dak iż-żmien forsi nkun naf aktar.
I don’t know a lot of people here.	Ma nafx ħafna nies hawn.
It wasn’t good either.	Lanqas ma kien tajjeb.
He had never seen this before.	Hu qatt ma kien ra dan qabel.
But you know something.	Imma taf xi ħaġa.
She says she won't.	Hi tgħid li mhux se.
He knows that now.	Huwa jaf li issa.
I'm always his.	Jien dejjem tiegħu.
We were there.	Konna hemm.
Come and go.	Jiġi u jmur.
Now just me.	Issa jien biss.
I was.	Jien kont.
Sure, he has some problems.	Żgur, għandu xi problemi.
I did enough tonight.	Għamilt biżżejjed illejla.
It should take a few hours.	Għandu jieħu ftit sigħat.
It turned out pretty well.	Ħareġ pjuttost tajjeb.
I'll be together soon.	Jien ser inkun flimkien dalwaqt.
I’ve been on one lately.	Kont fuq waħda dan l-aħħar.
In fact she had done nothing.	Fil-fatt ma kienet għamlet xejn.
So many times she was thinking about it.	Tant drabi hi kienet taħseb dwarha.
Both of them would.	It-tnejn li huma kieku.
Almost done.	Kważi lest.
You know that.	Int taf li.
It is working better than before.	Qed jaħdem aħjar minn qabel.
I made my first big no with him.	Għamilt l-ewwel le kbir tiegħi miegħu.
This is what you have here.	Dan huwa dak li għandek hawn.
I hope everything goes well.	Nittama li kollox imur tajjeb.
It’s hard to go back.	Huwa diffiċli li tmur lura.
He did nothing he did not want.	Huwa ma għamel xejn ma ried.
It can be of any size.	Jista 'jkun ta' kull daqs.
But he knows, really.	Imma jaf, tassew.
It’s pretty big, which is great.	Huwa pjuttost kbir, li huwa kbir.
You don’t have to know everything about each other.	M'għandekx għalfejn tkun taf kollox dwar xulxin.
You have friends.	Għandek ħbieb.
He should not stay here.	M'għandux jibqa' hawn.
It’s really too much to take.	Huwa verament wisq biex tieħu.
As I just said, it’s not a big deal.	Kif għadek kif għidt, mhix xi ħaġa kbira.
So many things she never knew.	Tant affarijiet li qatt ma kienet tkun taf.
Let’s go home together.	Ejja mmorru d-dar flimkien.
I don’t know why they do that.	Ma nafx għalfejn jagħmlu hekk.
I'm afraid to think.	Nibża naħseb.
This makes things pretty easy.	Dan jagħmel l-affarijiet pjuttost faċli.
That was what she was doing.	Dan kien dak li kienet tagħmel.
I know he was there.	Naf li kien hemm.
It may be working better.	Jista 'jkun qed jaħdem aħjar.
And we need your help.	U għandna bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
I’m too tired to talk.	Jien għajjien wisq biex nitkellem.
Just me, you know.	Jien biss, taf.
You still can't come to us.	Għadek ma tistax tiġi għandna.
Here’s what it really is.	Hawn x'inhu verament.
He could prove it all.	Huwa seta 'jipprova dan kollu.
I never have.	Jien qatt ma għandi.
He was leaving.	Kien jitlaq.
I thought it was too big for him.	Ħsibt li kien kbir wisq għalih.
He had only one.	Kellu wieħed biss.
The truth is, we have no idea what will happen.	Il-verità hi li m’għandniex idea x’se jiġri.
They were.	Dawn kienu .
None of these things happened.	L-ebda waħda minn dawn l-affarijiet ma ġara.
A small child.	Tifel żgħir.
Everything had to go.	Kollox kellu jmur.
All that is.	Dak kollu li hu.
Still talking.	Għadha titkellem.
It arrived yesterday.	Wasal ilbieraħ.
I think.	Jien naħseb.
Well, that’s what it looks like.	Ukoll, dan huwa dak li jidher.
No one can take that from me.	Ħadd ma jista’ jieħu dak minni.
I need more time to think about it.	Għandi bżonn aktar ħin biex naħseb dwarha.
It was just something we had to do.	Kienet biss ħaġa li kellna nagħmlu.
He loved to play as well.	Kien iħobb jilgħab ukoll.
But please.	Imma jekk jogħġbok.
I hope you do.	Nispera li tagħmel.
I'm not even sure.	Jien lanqas ċert.
And this is what we do.	U dan huwa dak li nagħmlu.
That he loved.	Li kien iħobb.
He could go to school.	Seta’ jmur l-iskola.
Something else.	Xi ħaġa oħra .
And it came out.	U ħareġ.
He had a problem.	Kellu problema.
So he did now.	Hekk għamel issa.
I once loved it.	Darba kont inħobb.
Well, almost nothing.	Ukoll, kważi xejn.
I still didn’t want to try.	Għadni ma ridtx nipprova.
I will take some things with us.	Ser nieħu xi affarijiet magħna.
I don’t know where I’m going from here.	Ma nafx fejn immur minn hawn.
Besides, you can't.	Barra minn hekk, ma tistax.
This would not be good.	Dan ma jkunx tajjeb.
And we can do it all.	U nistgħu nagħmlu dan kollu.
I hope it helps.	Nittama li jgħin.
I want to be so good.	Irrid inkun daqshekk tajjeb.
I know there is.	Naf li hemm.
The first is usually not.	L-ewwel normalment ma jkunx.
It does, in fact.	Dan jagħmel, fil-fatt.
Maybe it was.	Forsi kien.
It was just nothing good.	Kien biss xejn tajjeb.
That’s one thing you might not be able to do.	Dik hija ħaġa waħda li forsi ma tkunx kapaċi tagħmel.
Really, there is.	Tassew, hemm.
He had never seen so much.	Hu qatt ma kien ra daqshekk.
It was too big for one.	Kien kbir wisq għal wieħed.
I never wanted for anything.	Qatt ma ridt għal xejn.
I think you do that.	Naħseb li inti tagħmel dan.
I don’t really believe all that.	Jien ma tantx nemmen dak kollu.
And he had to do something about it.	U kellu jagħmel xi ħaġa dwarha.
I have never had that problem before.	Qatt ma kelli dik il-problema qabel.
He can't speak much.	Ma tantx jista’ jitkellem.
I really want to go home.	Verament irrid immur id-dar.
It took him a long time to get back.	Huwa ħa ħafna żmien biex mar lura.
I will never be like that.	Qatt ma nkun hekk.
But there was no more time.	Imma ma kienx hemm aktar ħin.
All in all, it looked good.	Kollox ma’ kollox, kienet tidher tajba.
I will talk about wanting a child.	Se nitkellem dwar li trid tifel.
There is someone else.	Hemm xi ħadd ieħor.
I knew everything about her.	Kont naf kollox dwarha.
Maybe you already have.	Forsi diġà għandek.
I would say it is not.	Jien ngħid li ma jkunx.
I thought it was happening before today.	Ħsibt li kien jiġri qabel illum.
My not.	Tiegħi mhux.
There is a really great one out there.	Hemm wieħed tassew kbir hemmhekk.
They don't.	Huma ma.
Or maybe years.	Jew forsi snin.
I said exactly.	għidt eżatt.
You know.	Taf ma.
He was not going to go back.	Ma kienx se jmur lura.
This is done once.	Dan isir darba.
You were someone.	Int kont tkun xi ħadd.
It was late.	Kien tard.
I try to be a good boy.	Nipprova nkun tifel tajjeb.
You can tell.	Tista 'tgħid.
We really did.	Għamilna tassew.
It doesn’t have to be one way or another.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun mod jew ieħor.
But it was not always so.	Imma mhux dejjem kien hekk.
It was going to happen sooner or later.	Kien se jiġri llum jew għada.
I still hear that.	Għadni nisma’ hekk.
You will be glad you did.	Int tkun ferħan li għamilt.
It won't do.	Mhux se tagħmel.
It could have been more than that.	Seta’ kien aktar minn hekk.
He had said his saying.	Huwa kien qal jgħid tiegħu.
This is the first.	Din hija l-ewwel.
What was that? 	Dak x'kien?
Now you will be able to do that.	Issa inti tkun kapaċi tagħmel dan.
I was so worried about tonight.	Kont tant inkwetat dwar illejla.
And that’s what happens.	U dak hu li jiġri.
I was on one.	Jien kont fuq waħda.
In fact he could not speak.	Fil-fatt ma setax jitkellem.
Trid.	Trid .
I've today.	Jien stajt illum.
Just some man.	Biss xi raġel.
It never had to be.	Qatt ma kellu jkun.
Not the first time, not the last.	Mhux l-ewwel darba, mhux l-aħħar.
I really wish it wasn’t.	Nixtieq tassew li ma kienx.
If she were here.	Kieku kienet hawn.
He was a really good boy.	Kien tifel tassew tajjeb.
I just don’t know when.	Jien biss ma nafx meta.
My job has become easy.	Ix-xogħol tiegħi sar faċli.
You’ve probably seen this.	X'aktarx li rajt dan.
He did things.	Huwa għamel l-affarijiet.
He got there quickly.	Wasal hemm malajr.
Or maybe just me.	Jew forsi jien biss.
All alone there.	Kollha waħdu hemmhekk.
For hours on end.	Għal sigħat wara xulxin.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
There is plenty of time to think.	Hemm ħafna ħin biex taħseb.
It wasn’t long enough.	Ma kienx twil biżżejjed.
It looks the same as yours.	Jidher l-istess bħal tiegħek.
Everything can go wrong.	Kollox jista’ jmur ħażin.
I want to be there.	Nixtieq inkun hemm.
He is a boy.	Huwa tifel.
We will not be forever.	Aħna mhux se nkunu għal dejjem.
Can anyone help please.	Jista' xi ħadd jgħin jekk jogħġbok.
He wanted to know everything.	Ried ikun jaf kollox.
Who is someone.	Min hu xi ħadd.
Something said.	Xi ħaġa qal.
I was a man.	Jien kont raġel.
Everything seemed the same yet.	Kollox kien jidher l-istess għadu.
Probably, there is.	Probabbilment, hemm.
She will not do that.	Hija mhux se tagħmel dan.
It is not either.	Mhuwiex u lanqas.
I heard nothing back.	Ma smajt xejn lura.
But of course you have to.	Imma ovvjament għandek.
And he certainly doesn't know what he's going to do to me.	U żgur li ma jafx x’se jagħmel miegħi.
That was enough.	Dan kien biżżejjed.
Because this is so.	Għaliex dan hu hekk.
I would be happy to be there.	Inkun kuntent li nkun hemm.
I have a son at home.	Għandi tifel id-dar.
It was just something he said.	Kienet biss xi ħaġa li qal.
It must be from someone.	Għandu jkun minn xi ħadd.
She wasn't seeing anyone.	Ma kienet qed tara lil ħadd.
You can do many things.	Tista 'tagħmel ħafna affarijiet.
It seems easy to me.	Jidher faċli għalija.
It had to be one of ours.	Kellha tkun waħda minn tagħna.
Properly.	Kif suppost.
They are always difficult.	Huma dejjem diffiċli.
He is not coming back.	Mhux qed jiġi lura.
But he will do what he will do.	Imma hu se jagħmel dak li se jagħmel.
Just like always happens.	Eżatt bħal dejjem jiġri.
That was for me.	Dik kienet għalija.
He is a good man.	Huwa raġel tajjeb.
It’s nothing more than that.	Mhu xejn aktar minn hekk.
Maybe he lost someone.	Forsi tilef lil xi ħadd.
He is the only one on ours.	Huwa l-uniku wieħed fuq tagħna.
It wasn’t just something.	Ma kienx biss xi ħaġa.
He was too good a man.	Kien raġel wisq tajjeb.
We know there will be.	Nafu li jkun hemm.
I didn’t think he would be interested.	Ma kontx naħseb li se jkun interessat.
But now, you’re here.	Imma issa, int hawn.
He went back more.	Huwa mar lura aktar.
That was not a good idea.	Dik ma kinitx idea tajba.
And as always.	U bħal dejjem.
And it’s almost working properly.	U kważi qed jaħdem kif suppost.
Now, enough talk.	Issa, biżżejjed titkellem.
But he was coming here first.	Imma kien ġej hawn l-ewwel.
Not a problem for us.	Mhux problema għalina.
It's just.	Huwa biss.
But he didn’t really want to.	Imma hu ma tantx ried.
Or maybe it was.	Jew forsi kienet.
I wasn’t sure what I was going to do.	Ma kontx ċert x'se nagħmel.
It's very easy when you know how.	Huwa faċli ħafna meta tkun taf kif.
But a lot of people.	Imma ħafna nies.
More time to think.	Aktar ħin biex taħseb.
So be it.	Hekk suppost tkun.
Here's the first one.	Hawn l-ewwel.
I was eating fast.	Kont qed niekol malajr.
But we both know it was him.	Imma t-tnejn nafu li kien hu.
And it probably never will.	U x'aktarx qatt ma se.
As long as he’s happy, good with me.	Sakemm hu kuntent, tajjeb miegħi.
I had thought about your car.	Kelli ħsibt dwar il-karozza tiegħek.
Say why.	Tgħid għaliex.
He didn’t know why, but they were there.	Ma kienx jaf għaliex, imma kienu hemmhekk.
Or maybe just me.	Jew forsi jien biss.
But that was easy too.	Imma dan kien faċli wisq.
Well, he didn't.	Ukoll, huwa ma.
I think she is someone.	Naħseb li hi xi ħadd.
I hope yours as well.	Nispera li tiegħek ukoll.
But it did a lot more for me.	Imma għamlet ħafna aktar għalija.
I never want to go back.	Jien qatt ma rrid nerġa’ lura.
It won’t be too bad.	Mhux se jkun ħażin wisq.
He was tired of that, too.	Huwa kien għajjien ta 'dak, ukoll.
But now he had to leave.	Imma issa kellu jitlaq.
No, you have to go.	Le, trid tmur.
It never happened that way.	Qatt ma ġara hekk.
But here, you can.	Imma hawn, tista '.
I know how you are.	Naf kif int.
I still know how.	Għadni naf kif.
Well, not as long as you want me to.	Ukoll, mhux sakemm trid lili.
I wanted it to be so.	Ridt li jkun hekk.
That would be too much.	Dan ikun wisq.
Or almost everything.	Jew kważi kollox.
He would never do anything about it.	Hu qatt ma kien jagħmel xejn dwarha.
All this.	Dan kollu.
One that had.	Waħda li kellha.
Tired too.	Għajjien ukoll.
If you're good to go.	Jekk int tajjeb biex tmur.
There are things you want to know.	Hemm affarijiet li trid tkun taf.
This is just the last thing.	Din hija biss l-aħħar ħaġa.
I don't know.	Jien ma nafx.
You will know more tomorrow.	Se tkun taf aktar għada.
No, not your home.	Le, mhux id-dar tiegħek.
In fact it was not his home.	Fil-fatt ma kinitx id-dar tiegħu.
He told me to tell the truth.	Huwa qalli biex ngħid il-verità.
It could happen to anyone.	Seta’ jiġri lil xi ħadd.
There is no need.	Ma jkunx hemm bżonn.
For a long time no one sees anything around here.	Għal żmien twil ħadd ma jara xejn madwar hawn.
But it’s not working yet.	Imma għadu mhux qed jaħdem.
She is alone and a child.	Hija biss u tifel.
It’s too much for us.	Huwa wisq għalina.
I wonder if there will be anything else.	Nistaqsi jekk hux se jkun hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
I believe it will be.	Nemmen li se jkun.
He is speaking for you.	Qed titkellem għalik.
We did it for you.	Għamilna għalik.
He is trying to live forever.	Qed jipprova jgħix għal dejjem.
That wasn’t his fault, it was mine.	Dak ma kienx ħażin tiegħu, kien tiegħi.
None of this seems to work.	Xejn minn dan jidher li jaħdem.
I’m talking about another.	Nitkellem dwar ieħor.
We will never know this until later.	Qatt ma nafu dan sa aktar tard.
She was, she was, capable of it.	Hija, kienet, kapaċi għal dan.
I can do the same.	Nista' nagħmel l-istess.
I heard everything.	Smajt kollox.
We don’t need to do more.	M'għandniex bżonn nagħmlu aktar.
There were a lot of people.	Kien hemm ħafna nies.
I take mine.	Jien nieħu tiegħi.
I have seen enough.	Rajt biżżejjed.
That and more.	Dak u aktar.
But she was his.	Imma hi kienet tiegħu.
Problem there.	Problema hemm.
He must remain.	Huwa għandu jibqa '.
Not what you think at all.	Mhux dak li taħseb xejn.
No, sit down, boy.	Le, joqgħod, tifel.
A lot has been happening lately.	Jiġri ħafna dan l-aħħar.
I’m here, she’s there.	Jien hawn, hi hemm.
In his room.	Fil-kamra tiegħu.
Everyone knows this.	Kulħadd jaf dan.
He had no idea how he had gone back home.	Ma kellux idea kif kien mar lura d-dar.
She knows that now.	Hija taf li issa.
I can only ask.	Nista’ biss nistaqsi.
He wanted to leave as soon as possible.	Ried jitlaq kemm jista’ jkun malajr.
And it was all here.	U kien kollu hawn.
I believe she did too.	Nemmen li għamlet ukoll.
I will be fine tomorrow.	Jien se nkun tajjeb għada.
I didn’t want that.	Jien ma ridtx hekk.
It was too big.	Kien kbir wisq.
You said enough.	Inti għidt biżżejjed.
I knew all this.	Kont naf dan kollu.
But how to do it.	Imma kif tagħmel dan.
But we go very well.	Imma mmorru tajjeb ħafna.
Many already have.	Ħafna diġà għandhom.
He doesn’t know how this works.	Ma jafx kif jaħdem dan.
We never had.	Qatt ma kellna.
It doesn’t take any time.	Ma jieħu l-ebda ħin.
But she can't stand it.	Imma hi ma tistax toqgħod.
He prayed for you.	Huwa talab għalik.
That would be enough.	Dan ikun biżżejjed.
And it really wasn’t that bad.	U verament ma kienx daqshekk ħażin.
Everything is going well for me right now.	Kollox sejjer tajjeb għalija bħalissa.
This will not be easy.	Dan mhux se jkun faċli.
We are sure we can do that.	Aħna żgur nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
We have done this many times.	Dan għamilna ħafna drabi.
Look! 	Ħares!
is coming back.	qed jiġi lura.
I've been there.	Stajt kont hemm.
It’s not very good, really.	Mhuwiex tajjeb ħafna, tassew.
She did it.	Hija għamlet dan.
You really don’t even know who you are.	Għadek tassew lanqas biss taf min int.
Just left.	Telaq biss.
In fact, that would be a good thing.	Fil-fatt, dik tkun ħaġa tajba.
I’ll be there with you, of course.	Jien inkun hemm miegħek, ovvjament.
I can't wait.	Ma nistax nistenna.
You want to do better than that.	Trid tagħmel aħjar minn hekk.
Stay with you for a little longer.	Wieħed jibqa' miegħek għal ftit żmien aktar.
That was my job.	Dan kien ix-xogħol tiegħi.
We have a lot.	Għandna ħafna.
I'm sure I will be !.	Jien żgur li se nkun!.
You have everything.	Għandek kollox.
I was right.	Kelli raġun.
It was very hard to know.	Kien diffiċli ħafna taf.
You have seen this before.	Inti rajt dan qabel.
Which you obviously are.	Li inti ovvjament.
Maybe it always will.	Forsi dejjem se.
You can't know what happened.	Ma tistax tkun taf x’ġara.
We did what felt right.	Għamilna dak li ħassu tajjeb.
Never, ever thought that this was going to happen.	Qatt, qatt ma ħsibt li dan kien se jiġri.
It’s hard to say about these things.	Huwa diffiċli li tgħid dwar dawn l-affarijiet.
Most people, actually.	Ħafna nies, fil-fatt.
No problem seems.	Jidher l-ebda problema.
Why, she didn't know.	Għaliex, hija ma kinitx taf.
Everyone wanted to come to our house.	Kulħadd ried jiġi d-dar tagħna.
I had a lot of help.	Kelli ħafna għajnuna.
And, we have that.	U, għandna dan.
Little by little everything went.	Ftit ftit mar kollox.
It's been about a long time.	Huwa kien madwar żmien twil.
It doesn’t have to be.	M'għandux għalfejn ikun.
I had to do it now.	Kelli nagħmel dan issa.
I wanted to be mine.	Ridt tkun tiegħi.
She is truly a boy.	Hija tassew tifel.
He was alone, as always.	Kien waħdu, bħal dejjem.
Before it happens.	Qabel ma jiġri.
He was alone at the time.	Dak iż-żmien kien waħdu.
They are friends.	Huma ħbieb.
It happens to be what happens.	Jiġri li jkun dak li jiġri.
If you’re big, you’re big.	Jekk int kbir, int kbir.
That would be so.	Dan ikun hekk.
I will have to talk to you.	Ikolli nitkellem miegħek.
He needed to know what he needed to know.	Kellu bżonn ikun jaf dak li kellu bżonn ikun jaf.
But it will.	Imma se.
I will ask this.	Jien se nistaqsi dan.
I won’t tell you.	Mhux se ngħidlek.
And most likely, it does.	U x'aktarx, hekk jagħmel.
No one could help.	Ħadd ma seta’ jgħin.
Really, all.	Tassew, kollha.
It should not be done.	M'għandux isir.
She was beautiful to me.	Kienet sabiħa miegħi.
Maybe no one knew who he was.	Forsi ħadd ma kien jaf min kien.
You have to do it for me.	Għandek tagħmel dan għalija.
Where possible.	Fejn jista’ jkun kien.
But it shouldn’t be.	Imma m'għandux ikun.
He wanted to do everything.	Ried jagħmel kollox.
Only something was wrong.	Xi ħaġa biss kienet ħażina.
He agreed to do so.	Huwa qabel li jagħmel hekk.
That for other people.	Dak għal nies oħra.
If you take it, it actually looked pretty good.	Jekk tieħu dan, huwa fil-fatt ħares pjuttost tajjeb.
He thought more.	Huwa ħaseb aktar.
I always say so.	Dejjem ngħid hekk.
He had no idea what to do.	Ma kellu l-ebda idea x'għandu jagħmel.
I want to talk a little bit about that.	Irrid nitkellem ftit dwar dan.
And besides.	U barra minn hekk.
Maybe what happened is a good thing.	Forsi dak li ġara hija ħaġa tajba.
But enough was enough.	Imma biżżejjed kien biżżejjed.
It won’t be for long.	Mhux se jkun għal żmien twil.
From yours really.	Minn tiegħek tassew.
We do everything always, all the time.	Aħna kull ħaġa dejjem, il-ħin kollu.
It's really so fast.	Huwa verament hekk malajr.
In fact, that’s really all we ever were.	Fil-fatt, dak huwa verament dak kollu li qatt konna.
And there were other things.	U kien hemm affarijiet oħra.
Something he had to do.	Xi ħaġa li kellu jagħmel.
What should he do? 	X'għandu jagħmel?
We must be able to do better.	Għandna nkunu kapaċi nagħmlu aħjar.
This is not a good thing for us.	Din mhix xi ħaġa tajba għalina.
I'm worried about what she will do.	Jien inkwetat dwar x'se tagħmel hi.
I must have heard wrong.	I għandu smajt ħażin.
But you can't do that.	Imma li ma tistax tagħmel.
I think there is something out there.	Naħseb li hemm xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
I never do that.	Qatt ma nagħmel hekk.
I have seen enough.	Rajt biżżejjed.
I was actually happy.	Fil-fatt kont kuntent.
Whatever you want.	Tkun xi tkun tixtieq.
For someone out of here.	Għal xi ħadd minn barra minn hawn.
It should work that way.	Għandu jaħdem hekk.
But he was not going to leave.	Imma ma kienx se jitlaq.
Sure, if you want.	Żgur, jekk trid.
There would be nothing more.	Ma kien ikun hemm xejn aktar.
There it was, as always.	Kien hemm, bħal dejjem.
That was so.	Dan kien hekk.
I will, soon.	Jien se, dalwaqt.
No my problem.	Le problema tiegħi.
Maybe it never was.	Forsi qatt ma kien.
I also know it won’t.	Naf ukoll li mhux se.
Everything would be fine.	Kollox ikun tajjeb.
No, it was all otherwise about.	Le, kien kollu mod ieħor dwar.
I’ve known this forever, everyone does.	Jien ilni naf dan minn dejjem, kulħadd jagħmel.
Today as follows.	Illum kif ġej.
And my house is not little.	U d-dar tiegħi mhix ftit.
I have to go so wrong.	Ikolli mmur daqshekk ħażin.
This is really great.	Dan huwa verament kbir.
Lots of money.	Ħafna flus.
But that was all she did.	Imma dak kien kollu li għamlet.
After that he said he was tired.	Wara dan qal li kien għajjien.
I did both.	Għamilt it-tnejn.
I can't understand why.	Ma nistax nifhem għaliex.
He didn’t want to say so.	Ma kienx ried jgħid hekk.
I do everything.	Jien nagħmel kollox.
No, they really are.	Le, huma tassew.
She doesn't even want to.	Hija lanqas tixtieq.
I wonder when it will be.	Nistaqsi meta se jkun.
No one will work.	Ħadd mhu se jaħdem.
Come as soon as possible.	Ejja kemm jista' jkun malajr.
He has no friends.	M’għandux ħbieb.
Everyone can say whatever they want.	Kulħadd jista’ jgħid dak kollu li jrid.
It’s really hard to tell.	Huwa verament diffiċli li tgħid.
She had to go.	Kellha tmur.
And now this is what it is for us.	U issa dan huwa dak li hu għalina.
There will be nothing.	Mhu se jkun hemm xejn.
No, never alone.	Le, qatt waħdu.
I don’t have to.	M'għandix għalfejn kont.
Or was it.	Jew kien.
But he never got home.	Imma qatt ma wasal id-dar.
This did not look good.	Dan ma deherx tajjeb.
I just try.	Nipprova biss.
I like to be busy.	Inħobb inkun okkupat.
And it is something you have to do.	U hija xi ħaġa li għandek tagħmel.
I definitely think it’s on to something.	Żgur li naħseb li qiegħed fuq xi ħaġa.
Ours will be the first.	Tagħna se tkun l-ewwel.
But that was me.	Imma dak kont jien.
She is very tired.	Hija għajjien ħafna.
I thought and thought about it.	Ħsibt u ħsibt dwarha.
They were already unseen.	Diġà kienu ma jidhirx.
That was fast.	Dak kien malajr.
I would like to talk about this.	Nixtieq nitkellem dwar dan.
Easy money for anyone.	Flus faċli għal xi ħadd.
We always had.	Dejjem kellna.
I didn’t know any of that stuff.	Jien ma kont naf xejn minn dak l-affarijiet.
Maybe more today than ever.	Forsi aktar illum minn qatt qabel.
That will not be a problem.	Dik mhux se tkun problema.
You can see that.	Inti tista 'tara li.
And it does so much more than that.	U jagħmel ħafna aktar minn hekk.
And that just happens to be something else.	U dan jiġri biss li hija xi ħaġa oħra.
It was actually quite.	Kien fil-fatt pjuttost.
I never do that.	Qatt ma nagħmel dan.
Better than anyone.	Aħjar minn ħadd.
As it was, no.	Kif kien, le.
I'm very tired.	Jien għajjien ħafna.
We were here.	Konna hawn.
No one was home at the time.	Ħadd ma kien id-dar dak iż-żmien.
Not good, not bad.	Mhux tajjeb, mhux ħażin.
One has to do it.	Wieħed irid jagħmel dan.
For a while, he was worried.	Għal xi żmien, kien inkwetat.
They are like.	Huma bħal .
Here's how to do it.	Hawn kif se tagħmel dan.
I would be helpful to him.	Inkun ta’ għajnuna għalih.
But you want to know what you are doing.	Imma trid tkun taf x'qed tagħmel.
All this seems to be long overdue now.	Dan kollu jidher li ilu issa.
You can't do that.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan.
There was something more.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa aktar.
He is not here this afternoon.	Hu mhux hawn illum wara nofsinhar.
I was there first.	I kien hemm l-ewwel.
What will be will be.	Dak li se jkun se jkun.
It’s all over now.	Huwa barra minn kollox issa.
It's not good.	Huwa mhux tajjeb.
I have to really go now.	Ikolli verament immur issa.
I wasn’t sure, obviously.	Jien ma kontx ċert, ovvjament.
But come on, it was so long ago.	Imma ejja, kien tant ilu.
Here's the problem.	Hawn il-problema.
Along with that.	Flimkien ma' dan.
This is the first one.	Din hija l-ewwel waħda.
Another is why there are so many.	Ieħor huwa għaliex hemm tant.
She thinks he’s more than that.	Hi taħseb li hu aktar minn hekk.
Maybe they are right.	Forsi għandhom raġun.
Only both.	It-tnejn biss.
.	.
He is always worried about this.	Huwa dejjem inkwetat dwar dan.
Just outside here.	Eżatt minn barra hawn.
We did what we were supposed to do.	Għamilna dak li suppost kellna nagħmlu.
It was not an easy job.	Ma kienx xogħol faċli.
Not for now.	Mhux għal issa .
But we have what we have.	Imma għandna dak li għandna.
He is my son.	Huwa tifel tiegħi.
It would be better now.	Bħalissa jkun aħjar.
He looks tired too.	Jidher għajjien ukoll.
She wants to stay.	Hija trid toqgħod.
Few are.	Ftit huma.
It may or may not always be.	Jista’ jkun imma mhux dejjem.
It just won’t happen.	Biss mhux se jiġri.
He left.	Huwa telaq.
That's how he can be.	Hekk jista’ hu.
But very good.	Imma tajjeb ħafna.
You have been back.	Inti ġejt lura.
Nothing just now.	Xejn biss issa.
I can't say who.	Ma nistax ngħid min.
It is supposed to help.	Suppost jgħin.
I thought she already knew.	Ħsibt li diġà kienet taf.
Like it never happened, or anything.	Bħal qatt ma ġara, jew xi ħaġa.
This may be his only chance to do so.	Dan jista 'jkun l-uniku ċans tiegħu li jagħmel dan.
Maybe not, he thought.	Forsi le, ħaseb.
I'm not always.	Jien mhux dejjem.
But not fast.	Imma mhux malajr.
Everything that was there was on.	Dak kollu li kienet kien hemm fuq.
I wasn’t just one.	Mhux kont wieħed biss.
Come now.	Ejja issa .
We never have time.	Qatt ma għandna ħin.
You know the house.	Taf id-dar.
He had tried so once.	Huwa kien ipprova hekk darba.
And that’s a lot of work as well.	U dan huwa ħafna xogħol ukoll.
He came out.	Huwa ħareġ.
To be sure.	Biex tkun ċert.
I will be coming around.	Se nkun ġej madwar.
It's almost nothing.	Huwa kważi xejn.
I was at school.	Kont l-iskola.
It was a long time ago.	Kien żmien twil ilu.
Better to do.	Aħjar jagħmlu.
I know how hard it is here.	Naf kemm hu diffiċli hawn.
Just everything is not what it seems.	Biss kollox mhux dak li jidher.
Sure, you know you’re a good teacher.	Żgur, taf li int għalliem tajjeb.
He went to school a lot.	Mar ħafna l-iskola.
You said.	Inti għidt.
It’s still not sure why there were so many people.	Għadu mhux ċert għaliex kien hemm tant nies.
I don’t know for sure.	Ma nafx ċert.
From this, if anything, he was sure.	Minn dan, jekk xejn, kien ċert.
I think it was pretty good.	Naħseb li kien pjuttost tajjeb.
I have to say something.	Ikolli ngħid xi ħaġa.
If she was alone, that was fine.	Jekk kienet waħedha, dan kien tajjeb.
It's some other people.	Huwa xi nies oħra.
It seemed like a lot of work.	Deher qisu ħafna xogħol.
But hard, to be here.	Imma diffiċli, li tkun hawn.
I don’t like it.	Jien ma nħobbx.
I'm just eating.	Qed niekol biss.
No one would come.	Ħadd ma kien jiġi.
He wasn't talking yet.	Għadu ma kienx qed jitkellem.
Well, that's just it.	Ukoll, huwa biss dan.
We are now on this.	Aħna issa fuq dan.
I was happy to try.	Kont kuntent li nipprova.
You are this.	Inti dan.
Now we can do that.	Issa nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
I can go shopping later.	Nista’ mmur nixtri aktar tard.
But now maybe it won’t.	Imma issa forsi mhux se.
Or so great.	Jew daqshekk kbir.
Usually, by then, it would be too late.	Normalment, sa dak iż-żmien, ikun tard wisq.
It doesn't have to work anymore.	M’għandux għalfejn jaħdem aktar.
He goes alone.	Imur waħdu.
And a very good thing, too.	U ħaġa tajba ħafna, ukoll.
You have to be good.	Trid tkun tajjeb.
You stay right here.	Inti toqgħod eżatt hawn.
In fact, this had already happened.	Fil-fatt, dan kien diġà ġara.
I would know where I was.	Inkun naf fejn kont.
Worried.	Inkwetat.
It may not seem like a problem.	Jista 'ma jidhirx problema.
She had it there.	Kellha hemmhekk.
You are already there.	Int hemm diġà.
He wanted to know more about her.	Ried ikun jaf aktar dwarha.
I’ve known all this for years.	Stajt naf dan kollu għal snin.
Maybe not tonight.	Forsi mhux illejla.
Come back later !.	Jiġi lura aktar tard!.
Everything was on nothing.	Kollox kien fuq xejn.
There is nothing like it.	M'hemm xejn bħal dan.
He was out there.	Huwa kien hemm barra.
I always think about things.	Jien dejjem naħseb dwar l-affarijiet.
Definitely couldn’t be.	Żgur li ma setax ikun.
I think she would say so.	Naħseb li kienet tgħid hekk.
He knew who we were for.	Kien jaf min konna għalih.
This should be easy to see.	Dan għandu jkun faċli biex tara.
It took a long time.	Ħa ħafna żmien.
It was just something.	Kienet biss xi ħaġa.
My friend made one and it was easy.	Ħabib tiegħi għamel wieħed u kien faċli.
There was no time to go back.	Ma kienx hemm ħin biex tmur lura.
Let me try really fast.	Ħa nipprova tassew malajr.
This can be seen in.	Dan jista 'jidher fi.
It wasn’t big, and it wasn’t small.	Ma kienx kbir, u ma kienx żgħir.
But she would be the same person.	Imma hi tkun l-istess persuna.
I never thought so.	Qatt ma kont naħseb hekk.
Later, he said maybe he knew.	Aktar tard, huwa qal li forsi kien jaf.
I still see.	Għadni nara.
Maybe he can.	Forsi jista '.
That's where it started.	Hemmhekk beda.
And maybe, for a while, do.	U forsi, għal ftit żmien, tagħmel.
Well you still don't.	Ukoll għadek ma.
Maybe more than he needed.	Forsi aktar milli kellu bżonn.
You are not.	M'intix .
I was right about that.	Jien kont raġun fuq dan.
I saw a lot.	Rajt ħafna.
I can prove that.	I jista 'jipprova dak.
Great for him.	Kbir għalih.
I hope to go back someday.	Nispera li nerġa’ mmur lura xi darba.
It won’t be forever.	Mhux se jkun għal dejjem.
No one came.	Ħadd ma ġie.
I really wish it was.	Nixtieq tassew li kien.
I just saw this.	Għadni kif rajt dan.
Something was wrong here.	Xi ħaġa kienet ħażina hawn.
This is what you want me to know.	Dan huwa dak li trid li nkun naf.
Definitely would.	Żgur li kieku.
Definitely once told me to do something.	Żgur li xi darba qalli nagħmel xi ħaġa.
Too much work and not enough time.	Wisq xogħol u mhux biżżejjed ħin.
I'm not that.	Jien mhux dak.
If you have ever seen anyone again.	Jekk qatt ra lil xi ħadd mill-ġdid.
You are not the only one.	M'intix l-uniku wieħed.
My time has come.	Wasal iż-żmien tiegħi.
He knew where she was.	Kien jaf fejn kienet.
Not happy with.	Mhux kuntent bi.
I don’t even do that.	Jien lanqas ma nagħmel dan.
For me, everyone wins.	Għalija, kulħadd jirbaħ.
Such a man has few friends.	Raġel bħal dan għandu ftit ħbieb.
He just does it.	Huwa biss tagħmel dan.
And it needs more time than ever.	U jeħtieġ aktar ħin minn qatt qabel.
It can be where it wants to be.	Jista’ jkun fejn irid ikun.
Or a year.	Jew sena.
It was always more like that.	Kien dejjem aktar bħal dik.
I wonder how this happened.	Nistaqsi kif ġara dan.
Very good.	Ħafna tajjeb.
But you may not want this.	Imma jista 'jkun li ma ridtx dan.
It just does.	Hija biss tagħmel.
.	.
Maybe he asked too.	Forsi talab ukoll.
You were always good to me.	Int dejjem kont tajba miegħi.
I was very.	Kont ħafna.
Because this was there.	Għaliex dan kien hemm.
I also go home.	Jien ukoll immur id-dar.
I’ve always been here.	Jien dejjem ġejt hawn.
I just heard.	Għadni kemm smajt.
It must have taken a lot of time and money.	Għandu jkun ħa ħafna ħin u flus.
I need something.	Għandi bżonn xi ħaġa.
No one had much to say.	Ħadd ma kellu ħafna xi jgħid.
You wouldn't want me.	Inti ma tkunx trid lili.
Some people really are.	Xi nies verament huma hekk.
I really have.	Jien tassew għandi.
And they looked at each other.	U ħares lejn xulxin.
For me, it was.	Għalija, kien.
You can.	Tista .
It was too long.	Kien twil wisq.
I didn’t even sit down.	Lanqas kont noqgħod bilqiegħda.
That you are doing.	Li qed tagħmel.
I don’t want you to be in love with me.	Ma rridx li tkun inħobb miegħi.
Look at this.	Ħares lejn dan.
You know that.	Inti taf dan.
I believe we can do better.	Nemmen li nistgħu nagħmlu aħjar.
Obviously you are not staying.	Ovvjament m'intix toqgħod.
There is nothing more.	M'hemm xejn aktar.
See where this is going.	Tara fejn sejjer dan.
Everyone can be happy.	Kulħadd jista 'jkun kuntent.
You don’t want it to be too much.	Inti ma tridx li jkun wisq.
He really didn’t want to think about it.	Huwa tassew ma riedx jaħseb dwarha.
That will be.	Dak se jkun.
You know, ahead of time.	Taf, qabel iż-żmien.
But you just know that.	Imma int biss taf li.
But it was difficult.	Imma kien diffiċli.
And it’s still not enough.	U għadu mhux biżżejjed.
I'm there.	Jien hemm.
There, anything and everything can happen.	Hemmhekk, kollox u kollox jista 'jiġri.
It will be pretty good.	Se jkun pjuttost tajjeb.
It seems not easy.	Jidher mhux faċli.
I never did that.	Jien qatt ma kont nagħmel hekk.
It happened very late.	Ġara tard ħafna.
He will wait for you.	Huwa se jistenna għalik.
You are doing well.	Int sejjer tajjeb.
Much, much more.	Ħafna, ħafna aktar.
I? 	I?
She is not like you.	Hija mhix kif int.
I have something on.	Għandi xi ħaġa fuq.
I know there is nothing there.	Naf li m'hemm xejn hemmhekk.
I did something like that once.	Għamilt xi ħaġa bħal dik darba.
He had seen what he had seen.	Huwa kien ra dak li kien ra.
I tell you.	Jien ngħidlek.
It always seemed to be going that way.	Dejjem deher li sejjer hekk.
Maybe there is something he can do.	Forsi hemm xi ħaġa li jista 'jagħmel.
And he is there.	U hu hemm.
You are still interested.	Għadek interessat.
We did everything we were supposed to do.	Għamilna dak kollu li suppost kellna nagħmlu.
No one was really having fun.	Ħadd ma kien verament jieħu gost.
This is about something else.	Din hija dwar xi ħaġa oħra.
It seems that this should not be so difficult.	Jidher li dan m'għandux ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
He knew the truth about it.	Kien jaf il-verità dwarha.
Let’s go back there.	Ejja mmorru lura hemmhekk.
This must be done.	Dan irid isir.
So it was.	Hekk kienet.
I was never there.	Qatt ma kont hemm.
Everyone knew and no one did anything.	Kulħadd kien jaf u ħadd ma għamel xejn.
Just really fast.	Biss verament malajr.
It all works.	Dan kollu jaħdem.
I doubt I will ever know.	Niddubita li qatt ser inkun naf.
Why would.	Għaliex kieku .
But he wanted it.	Imma hu ried dan.
Everyone can think they want to.	Kulħadd jista’ jaħseb li jrid.
I want to be one.	Nixtieq inkun wieħed.
Everything works fine.	Dak kollu jaħdem tajjeb.
Here's something wrong.	Hawn xi ħaġa ħażina.
He can't even speak.	Ma jistax lanqas jitkellem.
It's really nothing.	Huwa verament mhux xejn.
I’m not here anymore.	Jien m'iniex hawn aktar.
Maybe he’s just happy.	Forsi hu biss kuntent.
You have to be a great man.	Trid tkun raġel kbir.
Nothing to see.	Xejn x'tara.
Also, we didn’t have much money.	Barra minn hekk, ma tantx kellna flus.
That was my house.	Dak kien id-dar tiegħi.
She had to be here by now.	Hi kellha tkun hawn sa issa.
And it should.	U għandu.
What are you planning to do now.	Dak li qed tippjana li tagħmel issa.
And there really is.	U tassew hemm.
It had taken too long.	Huwa kien ħa wisq.
Maybe just again.	Forsi għal darba oħra biss.
There is nothing more you can do here.	M'hemm xejn aktar li tista 'tagħmel hawn.
But it was good.	Imma kien tajjeb.
Everything was happening so fast.	Kollox kien qed jiġri hekk malajr.
Everyone should go home now.	Kulħadd għandu jmur id-dar issa.
I'm sorry you never knew.	Jiddispjaċini milli qatt tista’ tkun taf.
You have to be.	Int għandek tkun.
I’ve never seen this, either.	Jien qatt ma rajt dan, lanqas.
It can be with us.	Jista’ jkun hekk magħna.
He knew it wasn’t.	Kien jaf li ma kinitx.
I’m not so worried about that.	Jien mhux daqshekk inkwetat dwar dan.
But it went well.	Imma mar tajjeb.
I didn’t do anything alone.	Jien ma għamilt xejn waħdi.
I have some work to do.	Għandi xi xogħol.
But never do.	Imma qatt ma tagħmel.
That’s not always easy.	Dak mhux dejjem faċli.
This is pretty big.	Dan huwa pjuttost kbir.
And so it will.	U hekk se.
I've never heard of this before.	Qatt ma smajt b’dan qabel.
You know how it was.	Taf kif kien.
He does what he wants to do.	Jagħmel li jrid jagħmel.
And, you can’t even stand your house alone.	U, lanqas ma tistax toqgħod id-dar tiegħek waħdek.
It was like I said.	Kien kif għidt.
That was the last thing she needed.	Din kienet l-aħħar ħaġa li kellha bżonn.
Everything else can only wait.	Kollox ieħor jista 'biss jistenna.
He did, nothing.	Huwa ma, xejn.
It was just great.	Kienet biss kbira.
It could be good.	Jista 'jkun tajjeb.
It was the only way, really.	Kien l-uniku mod, tassew.
You see this is a problem.	Tara din hija problema.
Well, that was quick.	Ukoll, li kien malajr.
I saw what happened.	Jien kont rajt x’ġara.
It does everything right.	Jagħmel kollox tajjeb.
They are my thing.	Huma ħaġa tiegħi.
We will be together for a long, long time.	Se nkunu flimkien għal żmien twil, twil.
He thought he would do a great job.	Ħaseb li se jagħmel xogħol kbir.
It was a chance.	Kien ċans.
It is not.	Mhuwiex .
Or maybe she wasn’t thinking about anything.	Jew forsi ma kienet qed taħseb xejn.
You are more than that.	Int aktar minn hekk.
I always thought it would be me.	Dejjem ħsibt li se nkun jien.
I needed to.	Kelli bżonn.
He shouldn't have died that way.	Ma kellux miet hekk.
It would definitely do well.	Żgur li kien jagħmel tajjeb.
Things are pretty good.	L-affarijiet huma pjuttost tajba.
I think it’s still what it is.	Naħseb li għadu dak li hemm.
She did much more than that.	Hija għamlet ħafna aktar minn hekk.
One is.	Wieħed huwa.
Really do.	Tassew jagħmlu.
He was glad.	Kien ferħan.
But that was quite a while ago.	Imma dan kien pjuttost ftit ilu.
Sorry, she says.	Jiddispjaċini, tgħid hi.
But no more.	Imma mhux aktar.
We're just eating.	Aħna biss qed tiekol.
Now everyone sees.	Issa kulħadd jara.
You always have been.	Int dejjem kont.
He was still wearing it all.	Kien għadu liebes kollu.
I was not back.	Jien ma kontx lura.
But you are so right.	Imma tant għandek raġun.
You should be glad.	Għandek tkun ferħan.
That you are not alone.	Li m'intix waħdek.
I’m just not the same there.	Jien biss mhux l-istess hemmhekk.
It’s so hard to talk to him.	Huwa daqshekk diffiċli biex titkellem miegħu.
I’m sorry for him, really.	Jiddispjaċini għalih, tassew.
I didn’t have time for that.	Ma kellix ħin għal dan.
Not here, not now, not so.	Mhux hawn, mhux issa, mhux hekk.
He hadn’t really thought about it.	Huwa ma kienx verament ħaseb dwar dan.
What his is yours.	X'inhu tiegħu huwa tiegħek.
That may just be a good thing.	Dik tista 'tkun biss ħaġa tajba.
That's good.	Dak huwa tajjeb.
He is always there.	Huwa dejjem hemm.
I know he thinks a lot for you.	Naf li jaħseb ħafna għalik.
We have been doing this for too long.	Għamilna dan għal wisq żmien.
If he survives.	Jekk jgħix.
There is a problem.	Hemm problema.
If he came back today, he saw me around.	Jekk ġie lura llum, ra lili madwar.
And this has now been done.	U dan issa sar.
No one seems to know why it is so.	Ħadd ma jidher li jaf għaliex hu hekk.
You account.	Int kont.
This forever.	Dan għal dejjem.
Sorry for what happened.	Jiddispjaċini għal dak li ġara.
Here is my book.	Hawn il-ktieb tiegħi.
We were always more.	Dejjem konna aktar.
I like to talk.	Inħobb nitkellem.
I'm not so worried.	Jien mhux daqshekk inkwetat.
And it could be today.	U jista’ jkun illum.
It is not easy and not quick.	Mhuwiex faċli u mhux ta 'malajr.
It's just not ready.	Huwa biss mhux lest.
It could be a lot more.	Jista 'jkun ħafna aktar.
After all he was alone.	Wara kollox kien waħdu.
You have to come now.	Inti għandek tiġi issa.
Why he had done it.	Għaliex kien għamel dan.
If you need to do this, you will do it.	Jekk għandek bżonn tagħmel dan, int ser tagħmel dan.
Obviously it had to be that way.	Ovvjament kellu jkun hekk.
I doubt it will happen.	Niddubita li se jiġri.
So he had said.	Hekk kien qal.
Nor am I sure.	Lanqas jien m'inix ċert.
Nara naf.	Nara naf.
I will not do such a thing again.	Mhux se nerġa’ nagħmel xi ħaġa bħal din.
And this is what is happening.	U dan huwa dak li qed jiġri.
He just couldn't take it anymore.	Huwa biss ma setax jieħu aktar.
So he had it all.	Hekk kellu kollox.
It’s not something you need to come and see.	Mhix xi ħaġa li għandek bżonn tiġi u tara.
It wasn’t all he did.	Ma kienx dak kollu li għamel.
It's not easy.	Mhuwiex faċli.
The problem seems so great.	Il-problema tidher daqshekk kbira.
We have a big problem here people.	Għandna problema kbira hawn nies.
And after.	U wara.
I hear more.	Nisma aktar.
I couldn’t go back, not tomorrow.	Ma stajtx immur lura, għada mhux.
Well that happened.	Ukoll dan ġara.
She is so good to me.	Hija tant tajba miegħi.
He looks happy.	Jidher kuntent.
You know, the same as ever.	Taf, l-istess bħal qatt qabel.
Everyone should have one.	Kulħadd għandu jkollu wieħed.
He was out for a long time.	Huwa kien barra għal żmien twil.
Tomorrow will be you.	Għada tkun int.
But this was not difficult.	Imma dan ma kienx diffiċli.
I need your help.	Ikolli bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.	Ħażin, ħażin, ħażin.
I would like to know how I will go about this.	Nixtieq inkun naf kif se mmur dwar dan.
Not once have we done something wrong.	Mhux darba għamilna xi ħaġa ħażina.
He just doesn't know how.	Huwa biss ma jafx kif.
I need to go outside.	Għandi bżonn immur barra.
But maybe she will.	Imma forsi hi se.
I didn’t say anything at the time.	Jien ma għedt xejn dak iż-żmien.
I know some people do.	Naf li xi nies jagħmlu.
Like I said, you don’t have the time.	Kif għedt, m'għandekx il-ħin.
That time was long ago.	Dak iż-żmien kien twil ilu.
They do nothing.	Ma jagħmlu xejn.
But not this.	Imma mhux dan.
It is still made for.	Għadu sar għal.
It was, but there was more.	Kien, imma kien hemm aktar.
I think he says so.	Naħseb li jgħid hekk.
They were here before I came.	Kienu hawn qabel ma ġejt.
And she knew it.	U kienet taf.
He is here for you forever.	Huwa hawn għalik dejjem.
This can actually happen here.	Dan fil-fatt jista 'jiġri hawn.
Not even a little bit.	Lanqas ftit ftit.
I am here for you when ready.	Jiena hawn għalik meta lest.
This can be a very long time.	Dan jista 'jkun żmien twil ħafna.
And it always has been so.	U dejjem kien hekk.
He never needed to.	Qatt ma kellu bżonn.
It's long.	Huwa twil.
I wonder what it is.	Nistaqsi dak li hu.
I want to go, and wait.	Irrid immur, u nistenna.
No help.	L-ebda għajnuna.
It is not such a thing.	Mhix ħaġa bħal din.
It's a problem.	Huwa problema.
I know everything.	Naf kollox.
She was thinking.	Kienet taħseb.
You will see if it is so.	Se tara jekk hux hekk.
Don't settle.	M'għandekx toqgħod.
He was right to do so.	Kellu raġun jagħmlu hekk.
It should be good.	Għandu jkun tajjeb.
I’ve been thinking about it lately.	Jien kont qed naħseb dwarha dan l-aħħar.
I can tell you now.	Nista’ ngħidlek issa.
I want to do everything with you.	Irrid nagħmel kollox miegħek.
I don’t know why anyone would do that.	Ma nafx għalfejn xi ħadd jagħmel hekk.
I want every child to know this.	Irrid li kull tifel ikun jaf dan.
Good thing it was well.	Ħaġa tajba kien ukoll.
I'm the last one.	Jien l-aħħar wieħed.
Obviously they were tired.	Ovvjament kienu għajjien.
Maybe they were, but certainly not now.	Forsi kienu, imma żgur mhux issa.
It sure is now.	Huwa żgur issa.
I couldn’t even speak.	Lanqas stajt nitkellem.
And now is a good time.	U issa huwa żmien tajjeb.
She wants it that way.	Hija trid hekk.
It's not that big.	Mhuwiex daqshekk kbir.
He told me that.	Huwa qalli li.
It was hard to see.	Kien diffiċli biex tara.
A lot has happened.	Ġara ħafna.
Well now you can.	Ukoll issa tista '.
Something wrong wrong.	Xi ħaġa ħażina ħażina.
It’s just great to be back.	Huwa biss kbir li tkun lura.
I had thought about it.	I kellha ħsibt dwar dan.
It would be a bit.	Ikun daqsxejn.
That has already been done.	Dak diġà sar.
I can’t really talk now.	Ma nistax verament nitkellem issa.
You never say well.	Qatt ma tgħid tajjeb.
He looks like such a small man.	Jidher bħal raġel daqshekk żgħir.
At that time it was school.	Dak iż-żmien kien l-iskola.
But really, no.	Imma tassew, le.
I don’t know, I do.	Ma nafx, jien.
You can have your fun.	Tista' tieħu gost tiegħek.
He was a friend of so many.	Kien ħabib ta’ tant.
I went alone.	Jien mort waħdi.
I can do everything for everyone.	Kapaċi nagħmel kollox għal kulħadd.
He had to know better.	Huwa kellu jkun jaf aħjar.
I have seen like his before.	Rajt bħal tiegħu qabel.
I’m ready after that.	Jien lest wara dan.
I saw you.	Rajt inti.
No one takes anything.	Ħadd ma jieħu xejn.
And this is work being done.	U dan huwa xogħol li qed isir.
Well, now it is.	Ukoll, issa huwa.
You can't just go.	Inti ma tistax tmur biss.
She wishes she was.	Hija tixtieq li kienet.
He's just a man.	Huwa biss raġel.
When you go back home, now.	Meta tmur lura d-dar, issa.
It seems free.	Jidher bla.
It's pretty long.	Huwa pjuttost twil.
To be afraid of what he saw.	Biex jibża’ minn dak li ra.
I wish that, for once only.	Nixtieq li, għal darba biss.
But he had to keep talking.	Imma kellu jibqa’ jitkellem.
Not really anything.	Mhux verament xejn.
What should he do? 	X'għandu jagħmel?
he asked.	staqsa.
But you never know.	Imma qatt ma tkun taf.
I can't think of that.	Ma nistax naħseb dan.
I wasn’t out, you know.	Jien ma kontx barra, taf.
That's you.	Dak int.
If you’re not happy about it, you’re not alone.	Jekk m'intix kuntent dwar dan, m'intix waħdek.
You are not with me.	M'intix miegħi.
I need to.	Ikolli bżonn.
I still think a little bit about that.	Għadni naħseb xi ftit fuq dik.
So it seems, to me.	Hekk jidher, għalija.
That all came after.	Dak kollu ġie wara.
I don’t want to with me.	Ma rridx miegħi.
Almost say so.	Kważi tgħid hekk.
I’m as always early on.	Jien kif dejjem kont kmieni.
I couldn’t speak.	Ma stajtx nitkellem.
He may be happy to do something.	Jista’ jkun kuntent li jagħmel xi ħaġa.
Everyone left.	Kulħadd telaq.
It's probably good.	Hija probabbilment tajba.
This happened to me.	Dan ġara lili.
I have never done one of these.	Qatt ma għamilt waħda minn dawn.
Sorry, of course.	Jiddispjaċini, ovvjament.
It can be really good.	Jista 'jkun verament tajjeb.
Which probably wasn't.	Li probabbilment ma kienx.
And besides, it wasn’t small.	U barra minn hekk, ma kienx żgħir.
It’s easy and it works for me.	Huwa faċli u jaħdem għalija.
Apparently this was not the case.	Milli jidher dan ma kienx hekk.
He didn’t need to be.	Huwa ma kienx hemm bżonn li kien.
It seems like I couldn’t say anything.	Jidher li ma stajt ngħid xejn.
It looked good.	Deher li kien tajjeb.
Maybe you will never be able to.	Forsi qatt ma tkun kapaċi.
It's like a problem child.	Huwa bħal tifel problema.
I doubt they often do.	Niddubita li spiss jagħmlu.
It should only happen once.	Għandu jiġri darba biss.
It can't work.	Ma jista' jaħdem.
But maybe you’re right.	Imma forsi għandek raġun.
But he’s not talking about it.	Imma mhux qed jitkellem dwar dan.
We know he was there.	Nafu li kien hemm.
She knew what she was doing.	Kienet taf x’kien qed jagħmel.
It’s so great here.	Huwa daqshekk kbir hawn.
It's all mine.	Huwa kollox tiegħi.
You think you can do whatever you want.	Taħseb li tista’ tagħmel dak kollu li trid.
Or a good one.	Jew waħda tajba.
We are at work.	Aħna fuq ix-xogħol.
A little help would be a good thing right now.	Ftit għajnuna tkun ħaġa tajba bħalissa.
I would be buying.	Inkun qed nixtri.
He was playing well.	Kien jilgħab tajjeb.
There was no need to speak.	Ma kienx hemm bżonn li jitkellem.
But we have another way.	Imma għandna mod ieħor.
It shouldn’t happen.	M'għandux jiġri.
I will do all this.	Se nagħmel dan kollu.
He wasn't sure he could do it.	Ma kienx ċert li seta’ jagħmel dan.
If it was going to be him, so be it.	Jekk kien se jkun hu, hekk ikun.
There has to be something else for him.	Irid ikun hemm xi ħaġa oħra għalih.
Later, he thought.	Aktar tard, ħaseb.
And you again.	U int mill-ġdid.
This is the last chance to do well.	Din hija l-aħħar ċans biex tagħmel tajjeb.
You’re right, it’s time to go home.	Għandek raġun, wasal iż-żmien li tmur id-dar.
I'm all yours.	Jien kollu tiegħek.
I know you can do better.	Naf li tista’ tagħmel aħjar.
I didn’t know he had one.	Ma kontx taf li kellu wieħed.
It wouldn’t look like this.	Ma jkunx jidher bħal dan.
It's a good one.	Hija waħda tajba.
I’m not sure if it’s mine, or yours.	M'inix ċert jekk hux tiegħi, jew tiegħek.
What's with that.	X'hemm ma 'dak.
Was there ?.	Kien hemm?.
But it was too much for me.	Imma kien wisq għalija.
They are almost the same.	Huma kważi l-istess.
He could not eat.	Ma setax jiekol.
He is waiting.	Huwa qed jistenna.
Who works for me.	Min jaħdem għalija.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon enough.	Forsi mhux illum, forsi mhux għada, imma malajr biżżejjed.
It can be good, it can be bad.	Jista 'jkun tajjeb, jista' jkun ħażin.
I have to say this.	Ikolli ngħid dan.
But he couldn’t do that, either.	Imma hu ma setax jagħmel dan, lanqas.
There are many, friend.	Hemm ħafna, ħabib.
Tell me nothing.	Tgħidli xejn.
He was a boy.	Kien tifel.
He would do so.	Kien jagħmel hekk.
Better do what is right.	Aħjar tagħmel dak li hu tajjeb.
He doesn’t like to talk about it.	Ma jħobbx jitkellem dwarha.
She had a great son.	Kellha tifel kbir.
But she can't think.	Imma hi ma tistax taħseb.
He knew everything about her.	Kien jaf kollox dwarha.
If it doesn’t, maybe we won’t.	Jekk ma jagħmilx hekk, forsi aħna le.
But it’s too late for that now.	Imma huwa tard wisq għal dak issa.
I’m not alone either.	Jien lanqas waħdi.
This happens so fast.	Dan jiġri hekk malajr.
I'm going.	Jien se mmur.
Apparently everyone knew.	Milli jidher kulħadd kien jaf.
This was not going to win.	Dan ma kienx se jirbaħ.
We weren’t very there.	Ma konna ma tantx hemm.
Not many people either.	Lanqas ħafna nies.
It’s a bit much for me.	Huwa daqsxejn ħafna għalija.
Definitely coming back.	Żgur li ġej lura.
She had to stay.	Kellha toqgħod.
But it was always there.	Imma dejjem kien hemm.
But she will, later.	Imma hi se, aktar tard.
Whenever it is.	Kull meta jkun.
I'll be late.	Jien ser inkun tard.
That keeps happening.	Li jibqa’ jiġri.
He asked why she would come alone.	Huwa staqsa għaliex kienet tiġi waħedha.
It was all mine.	Kien kollu tiegħi.
Better late than never, but here we are.	Aħjar tard milli qatt, imma hawn aħna.
This is really a bad idea.	Din hija verament idea ħażina.
No, we cannot do that.	Le, ma nistgħux nagħmlu hekk.
He doesn’t want or doesn’t want more money.	Ma jridx jew ma jridx aktar flus.
It seems like I’ve always been here.	Jidher li dejjem kont hawn.
It's pretty good.	Huwa pjuttost tajjeb.
She hadn’t done anything like that, obviously.	Hija ma kinitx għamlet xi ħaġa bħal din, ovvjament.
And this will be all evening.	U dan se jkun illejla kollha.
He actually did.	Huwa fil-fatt għamel hekk.
Now, here’s another thing.	Issa, hawn ħaġa oħra.
He was right here.	Huwa kien eżatt hawn.
By now it was noon.	Sa issa kien nofsinhar.
He who he is.	Hu min hu.
And everyone had that.	U kulħadd kellu dak.
He didn’t have to.	Ma kellux hekk.
I have never seen anything like it.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din.
You have no money.	M'għandekx flus.
And let me tell you something else.	U ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa oħra.
I know you are not happy.	Naf li m'intix kuntent.
Now you see.	Issa tara.
Everything seems to have gone well.	Kollox jidher li mar tajjeb.
Not just me.	Mhux jien biss.
Bad thing to say.	Ħaġa ħażina li tgħid.
I'll be back soon.	Jien ser inkun lura dalwaqt.
That looks great.	Dak qisu ħafna.
You know that better than anyone.	Inti taf li aħjar minn ħadd.
And there was no one else around.	U ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor madwar.
They are the same size, it seems.	Huma l-istess daqs, jidher.
I have nothing more.	M'għandi xejn aktar.
I need a lot, a lot of money.	Għandi bżonn flus ħafna, ħafna.
He came first and did his thing.	Huwa daħal l-ewwel u għamel ħaġa tiegħu.
It doesn’t seem to work either.	Ma jidhirx li jaħdem lanqas.
I’m out, all that.	Jien barra, dak kollu.
If, as he says.	Jekk, kif jgħid hu.
Definitely, actually.	Żgur li, fil-fatt.
Probably a lot of people do that.	Probabbilment ħafna nies jagħmlu dan.
Do it or not.	Tagħmel jew le.
Now she knew what was going to happen.	Issa kienet taf x’kien se jiġri.
It was him.	Kien hu.
I have to try this.	Ikolli nipprova dan.
And you will be.	U int tkun.
We do everything right.	Nagħmlu kollox tajjeb.
Hi, I hope it goes well.	Hi, nittama li sejjer tajjeb.
Never be.	Qatt ma jkun.
That's very good.	Dak tajjeb ħafna.
There you are and just me.	Hemm int u jien biss.
I was too happy.	Kont kuntent wisq.
There was something wrong here.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa ħażina hawn.
Not today, but soon.	Mhux illum, imma dalwaqt.
If you are not, well, you are not.	Jekk m'intix, ukoll, m'intix.
No more !.	Mhux aktar!.
That's all I said.	Hekk għidt biss.
I didn’t do anything from above.	Jien ma għamilt xejn minn hawn fuq.
I'm sure you're tired.	Jien ċert li int għajjien.
He does it.	Huwa jagħmel dan.
I’m not sure he really wants to be there.	M'inix ċert li verament irid ikun hemm.
Obviously, everyone does that.	Ovvjament, kulħadd jagħmel dan.
You can be so with me.	Tista' tkun hekk miegħi.
As I thought.	Kif ħsibt.
You say nothing when you seem to say everything.	Ma tgħid xejn meta jidher li tgħid kollox.
You have school in the morning.	Għandek l-iskola filgħodu.
It was almost too easy.	Kien kważi faċli wisq.
It was not easy.	Ma kienx faċli.
I'm unemployed.	Jien bla xogħol.
He may seem to do nothing.	Jista 'jidher li ma tagħmel xejn.
And besides, you come with us.	U barra minn hekk, int ġej magħna.
Now, no one knows.	Issa, ħadd ma jaf.
He looked nothing but.	Huwa ħares xejn imma.
I've always been.	Dejjem stajt.
Something very wrong with him.	Xi ħaġa ħażina ħafna miegħu.
That’s where we want to be.	Hemmhekk irridu nkunu.
It takes some time to work.	Jieħu ftit ħin biex jaħdem.
Today she had to come back.	Illum kellha tiġi lura.
Still not alone.	Għadha mhux biss.
They are the same thing.	Huma l-istess ħaġa.
Only later where was he.	Biss ikun aktar tard fejn kien.
I know he’s happy.	Naf li hu kuntent.
It cannot be seen by anyone.	Ma jista’ jidher minn ħadd.
Outside, the morning was coming.	Barra, filgħodu kien ġej.
There is nothing difficult about it.	M'hemm xejn diffiċli dwar dan.
It wasn’t a big deal.	Ma kienx xi ħaġa kbira.
This really is.	Dan huwa verament.
You can do better than that.	Tista 'tagħmel aħjar minn dan.
There was something to that.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa għal dak.
If he leaves, he will return.	Jekk jitlaq, jerġa’ lura kollu.
We are more.	Aħna aktar.
But apparently not.	Imma milli jidher le.
There is a problem.	Hemm problema.
We only need a few things.	Għandna bżonn biss ftit affarijiet.
He can't.	Huwa jista 'le.
You have to do it.	Trid tagħmel dan.
I was good and happy, and busy.	Kont tajjeb u ferħan, u okkupat.
He is a person.	Huwa persuna.
And for that.	U għal dak.
It does.	Dan jagħmel.
There is no one.	M'hemm ħadd.
Quite harder.	Pjuttost aktar diffiċli.
It was school with me.	Kienet l-iskola miegħi.
You don't want him to come back.	Ma tridx li jerġa’ lura.
I see everyone and how they do things.	Nara lil kulħadd u kif jagħmlu l-affarijiet.
You did a lot for me.	Int għamilt ħafna għalija.
It couldn’t always be easy.	Ma setax dejjem ikun faċli.
It doesn’t work that way.	Mhux hekk jaħdem.
I will take a chance.	Se nieħu ċans.
But he came alone.	Imma ġie waħdu.
I have to do this well from time to time.	Ikolli nagħmel dan ukoll minn żmien għal żmien.
But there is a problem.	Imma hemm problema.
She would go there and see if she was there.	Kienet tmur hemm u tara jekk kinitx hemm.
Someone or something that wasn’t her.	Xi ħadd jew xi ħaġa li ma kinitx hi.
He did a lot for me.	Huwa għamel ħafna għalija.
We don’t need more than that.	M'għandniex bżonn aktar minn dan.
That’s not quite what it was.	Dak mhux pjuttost dak li kien.
Unless it’s something else.	Sakemm ma tkunx xi ħaġa oħra.
And you need to prove it.	U jeħtieġ li jipprova dan.
But there didn’t seem to be much work.	Imma ma jidhirx li kien hemm ħafna xogħol.
It was happening sooner or later.	Kien jiġri llum jew għada.
I know that too.	Jien naf hekk ukoll.
How to stay.	Kif toqgħod.
We can do that.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan.
No one seemed to be there.	Ħadd ma deher li kien hemm.
She didn’t know anymore.	Ma kinitx taf aktar.
There is someone out there.	Hemm xi ħadd hemmhekk.
What she did was wrong.	Dak li għamlet kien ħażin.
He did, and very well.	Dan għamel, u tajjeb ħafna.
That was really good.	Dak kien tassew tajjeb.
He will speak.	Hu se jitkellem.
He seemed very busy.	Deher li kien okkupat ħafna.
I have to try that.	Ikolli nipprova dak.
I think it was me.	Naħseb li kien minni.
I don’t want to go home.	Ma rridx immur id-dar.
It still wasn’t.	Għadu ma kienx.
It can do, someday.	Jista 'jagħmel, xi darba.
About a year, a little more.	Madwar sena, ftit aktar.
I need my friend back.	Għandi bżonn ħabib tiegħi lura.
I want to be here.	Irrid li jkun hawn.
He was mine.	Huwa kien tiegħi.
About so many things.	Dwar tant affarijiet.
That went wrong.	Dak ħareġ ħażin.
I think we did pretty well.	Naħseb li għamilna pjuttost tajjeb.
I better go.	Aħjar immur.
She had a lot.	Kellha ħafna.
It should be more than that.	Għandu jkun aktar minn hekk.
I had to be there.	I kellha tkun hemm.
Maybe they are supposed to.	Forsi suppost huma.
But he never had.	Imma qatt ma kellu.
You have to stay out of that car.	Trid toqgħod barra minn dik il-karozza.
I had my school.	Kelli l-iskola tiegħi.
I would say he did.	Jien ngħid li għamel.
I can't do that.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan.
Everything was as it was.	Kollox kien kif kien.
Everything comes back to me.	Kollox jiġi lura għandi.
It seemed easy too.	Deher faċli wisq.
I have never told anyone so.	Qatt ma għedt lil ħadd hekk.
Better not.	Aħjar ma.
He had been thinking the same thing for a long time.	Kien ilu jaħseb l-istess ħaġa.
There is plenty of time for this.	Hemm ħafna ħin għal dan.
No work too small.	L-ebda xogħol żgħir wisq.
Sure enough, they were.	Żgur biżżejjed, kienu.
He was a good boy.	Kien tifel tajjeb.
He could not say no.	Ma kienx ikun jista’ jgħid le.
He'll be good back there for a while.	Hu ser ikun tajjeb hemm lura għal ftit.
She'll know nothing about it.	Hija ser tkun taf xejn dwar dan.
Everything is still.	Kollox għadu.
It wasn’t a big deal at the time.	Dak iż-żmien ma kinitx xi ħaġa kbira.
I can’t do that anymore.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan aktar.
But that’s not the big problem.	Imma dik mhix il-problema kbira.
There you are.	Hemmhekk int.
And that’s not a good thing.	U dik mhix xi ħaġa tajba.
You don’t have to do that.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel dan.
This can be.	Dan jista 'jkun.
Everyone said the same.	Kulħadd qal l-istess.
It started badly.	Beda ħażin.
Maybe this was the first time.	Forsi din kienet l-ewwel darba.
And what I did.	U dak li għamilt.
There is something here for everyone.	Hemm xi ħaġa hawn għal kulħadd.
He will stay there again.	Se jerġa' joqgħod hemm.
It was a good year.	Kienet sena tajba.
I couldn’t do anything about it.	Jien ma stajt nagħmel xejn dwar dan.
They are difficult.	Huma diffiċli.
it must be him.	għandu jkun hu.
Well, better late than never.	Ukoll, aħjar tard milli qatt.
And all this wrong.	U dan kollu ħażin.
Sometimes that works.	Xi drabi dak jaħdem.
But not so.	Imma mhux hekk.
Of what is good and what is bad.	Ta’ dak li hu tajjeb u dak li hu ħażin.
She was too tired.	Kienet għajjien wisq.
.	.
Or so he says.	Jew hekk jgħid hu.
That’s really, really, all there is to it.	Dak hu verament, tassew, dak kollu li hemm għalih.
Too often too.	Ħafna drabi wisq.
I'm not interested.	M'iniex interessat.
I would say enough is enough.	Jien ngħid biżżejjed biżżejjed.
You can talk.	Tista' titkellem.
This is a good thing for almost everyone.	Din hija ħaġa tajba għal kważi kulħadd.
That’s pretty big for everyone.	Dak huwa pjuttost kbir għal kulħadd.
And that was a good thing.	U dik kienet ħaġa tajba.
Or you can do it.	Jew tista 'tagħmel dan.
I did this yesterday.	Għamilt dan il-bieraħ.
Not my job.	Mhux xogħol tiegħi.
But he was too tired to speak.	Imma kien għajjien wisq biex jitkellem.
Everything looks good now.	Kollox jidher tajjeb issa.
It's too small.	Huwa żgħir wisq.
It’s all good for you.	Huwa kollox tajjeb għalik.
We know, it’s a lot.	Nafu, huwa ħafna.
He was never here much for him.	Qatt ma kien hawn ħafna għalih.
Not just talking.	Mhux biss titkellem.
I can’t do all this alone.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan kollu waħdi.
They are us.	Huma aħna.
I didn’t want money at all bad.	Ma ridtx flus xejn ħażin.
For a long time to come.	Għal ħafna żmien li ġej.
I see what you're after.	Nara dak li qed wara.
There will always be someone who works harder.	Dejjem ikun hemm xi ħadd li jaħdem aktar.
I try that now.	Nipprova dak issa.
Everything was there.	Kollox kien hemm.
You are what you are.	Int dak li int.
Outside he went.	Barra huwa mar.
He wasn’t like everyone else, and he knew it.	Ma kienx bħal kulħadd, u kien jaf.
I need to.	Għandi bżonn .
He saw something there.	Huwa ra xi ħaġa hemmhekk.
And maybe that’s a good thing.	U forsi din hija ħaġa tajba.
Maybe it will take longer.	Forsi se tieħu aktar.
She already had you.	Diġà kellha int.
She could be there.	Hija tista 'tkun hemm.
This was easier to think of.	Dan kien aktar faċli biex wieħed jaħseb.
And it wasn’t good.	U ma kinitx tajba.
He would have been alone there back.	Kien ikun waħdu hemm lura.
I doubt they were ever actually together.	Niddubita li qatt kienu fil-fatt flimkien.
Maybe you are right.	Forsi għandek raġun.
It's fun.	Huwa jieħu gost.
Well, you know that already.	Ukoll, inti taf li diġà.
That’s going very well.	Dak sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
There is some problem here.	Hemm xi problema hawn.
You already have one.	Diġà għandek waħda.
I can’t do anything about it.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn dwar dan.
We know everything.	Nafu kollox.
He had to leave early.	Kellu jitlaq kmieni.
It had to happen sooner or later.	Kellha jiġri llum jew għada.
You know this happens.	Taf li dan jiġri.
You are not ready yet.	Għadek m'intix lest.
We know enough.	Nafu biżżejjed.
I will never be the same.	Jien qatt mhu se nkun l-istess.
Not sure about that.	Mhux ċert dwar dan.
It was early afternoon.	Kien kmieni wara nofsinhar.
I was alone.	Kont waħdi.
I didn’t know anyone.	Jien ma kont naf lil ħadd.
We know very little.	Ma tantx nafu.
And it's just wrong.	U huwa biss ħażin.
I didn’t know what I was going to do.	Jien ma kontx naf x'se nagħmel.
But one could not have everything.	Imma wieħed ma setax ikollu kollox.
It will not be so forever.	Mhux se jkun hekk għal dejjem.
He's worried.	Huwa inkwetat.
She looked great.	Hija ħares kbira.
Sorry, you say.	Jiddispjaċini, tgħid.
That's ready to go.	Dak lest biex imur.
It seems we have a problem.	Jidher li għandna problema.
You’re busy thinking about what you will do next.	Int okkupat taħseb dwar dak li se tagħmel wara.
As you can tell.	Kif tista’ tgħid.
And there was something else, too.	U kien hemm xi ħaġa oħra, ukoll.
You went for.	Inti mort għal .
And it’s not very big.	U mhuwiex kbir ħafna.
And this week, it’s here.	U din il-ġimgħa, wasal.
I say this too.	Jien ngħid dan ukoll.
And maybe you better not know.	U forsi jkun aħjar li ma tkunx taf.
If there was anything.	Kieku kien hemm xi ħaġa.
But look at this here.	Imma ħares lejn dan hawn.
Maybe it was time.	Forsi kien iż-żmien.
There weren’t enough hours for all this.	Ma kienx hemm biżżejjed sigħat għal dan kollu.
Look at what he had done.	Ħares lejn dak li kien għamel.
This has happened to me a few times.	Dan ġara lili ftit drabi.
I didn’t even know they would do that.	Lanqas kont naf li jagħmlu hekk.
You want to know what you want.	Trid tkun taf dak li trid.
He should eat.	Għandu jiekol.
Imma le le le.	Imma le le le.
He said she was not there.	Qal li ma kinitx hemm.
All be well.	Kollha tkun tajba.
She speaks a little too fast.	Hija titkellem ftit wisq malajr.
I’m going to do anything you say.	Jien ser nagħmel kull ħaġa li tgħid.
It should work properly.	Għandu jaħdem kif suppost.
No one needs to see.	Ħadd ma għandu bżonn jara.
You weren’t there with me at all.	Inti ma kont hemm miegħi xejn.
It was long before his time.	Kien ħafna qabel iż-żmien tiegħu.
But what is this.	Imma x'inhu dan.
It could be better.	Jista 'jkun aħjar.
Not so.	Mhux hekk ġara.
I hope this helps.	Nispera li dan jgħin.
I was there all the time.	Kont hemm il-ħin kollu.
He said he could wait.	Qal li jista’ jistenna.
It takes a lot of time.	Huwa jieħu ħafna ħin.
And almost anyone can say anything.	U kważi kulħadd jista’ jgħid xi ħaġa.
Better than ever.	Aħjar milli qatt seta’.
It has been currently.	Ġie bħalissa.
Everyone is talking about it.	Kulħadd jitkellem dwarha.
This can go a long way.	Dan jista’ jmur ħażin għalih xi darba.
Everyone was watching.	Kulħadd kien qed jara.
She had to know.	Kellha tkun taf.
This was a good and bad thing.	Din kienet xi ħaġa tajba u ħażina.
I will try this now.	Se nipprova dan issa.
You never really know.	Int qatt ma taf verament.
There was nothing easy about it.	Ma kien hemm xejn faċli dwarha.
I can say both.	Nista’ ngħid it-tnejn.
You were a boy.	Inti kont tifel.
He is doing very well.	Huwa sejjer tajjeb ħafna.
He never knew why.	Hu qatt ma kien jaf għaliex.
He is having a great time.	Qed ikollu żmien kbir.
But you know.	Imma tkun taf.
It's better for you.	Huwa aħjar għalik.
Always came.	Dejjem daħal.
But there are many out there.	Imma hemm ħafna hemmhekk.
He is not a bad man.	Mhuwiex raġel ħażin.
No one else lives.	Ħadd ieħor ma jgħix.
It could have been someone, he thought.	Seta’ kien xi ħadd, ħaseb.
Anyone who wants to stay here can stay here.	Min irid jibqa’ hawn jista’ jibqa’ hawn.
I think it’s wrong.	Naħseb li huwa ħażin.
If it were easy, most would do it.	Kieku kien faċli, aktar jagħmlu dan.
That’s probably more likely.	Dak probabbilment huwa aktar probabbli.
I want you to know that I am.	Irrid li tkun taf li jien.
That was what he would have.	Dan kien dak li kien ikollu.
As soon as we can.	Hekk kif nistgħu.
He just came to me.	Huwa biss wasal lili.
It wasn’t that big.	Ma kienx daqshekk kbir.
But he wanted more than that.	Imma ried aktar minn hekk.
I don’t even believe it.	Jien lanqas nemmen.
And it really helps.	U tassew jgħin.
She sees what it is.	Hija tara x'inhu.
I hope it’s good.	Nispera li hu tajjeb.
Nothing went well.	Xejn mar tajjeb.
I did it today.	Għamilt illum.
She wasn’t going to think about it.	Hija ma kinitx se taħseb dwar dan.
But here's a problem.	Imma hawn problema.
I didn’t even have to be there.	Jien lanqas kelli nkun hemm.
He bought time.	Huwa xtara ħin.
I was good, so good for so long.	Kont tajjeb, tant tajjeb għal tant żmien.
But there had to be something.	Imma kellu jkun hemm xi ħaġa.
You can't do that here.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan hawn.
Or, better yet, on what it doesn’t do.	Jew, aħjar, fuq dak li ma jagħmilx.
I just don’t know how to do it.	Jien biss ma nafx kif nagħmel dan.
It was very good.	Kien tajjeb ħafna.
And it took a lot longer.	U ħa ħafna aktar żmien.
You can come here whenever you want.	Tista’ tiġi hawn kull meta trid.
Something could have happened outside.	Seta’ ġara xi ħaġa hawn barra.
He had done it, once.	Huwa kien għamel dan, darba.
I think it needs a little more work.	Naħseb li jeħtieġ ftit aktar xogħol.
For other things, it’s harder to say.	Għal affarijiet oħra, huwa aktar diffiċli li tgħid.
If you think it will help.	Jekk taħseb li se jgħin.
Size too big.	Daqs kbir wisq.
Everything happened so fast.	Kollox ġara daqshekk malajr.
He got there.	Huwa wasal hemm.
I still am, of course.	Jien għadni, ovvjament.
But he never came home.	Imma qatt ma ġie d-dar.
I want you to think about it.	Nixtieq li taħseb dwar dan.
He could not wait to know the truth.	Ma setax jistenna li jkun jaf il-verità.
They just aren't there.	Huma biss hekk mhux hemm.
But there was a problem.	Imma kien hemm problema.
With a little.	Bi ftit.
She did before.	Hija għamlet qabel.
I’m sure she’s home.	Jien ċert li hija d-dar.
There is more to it than that.	Hemm aktar minn dan.
If you had any idea.	Jekk kellek xi idea.
But nothing seems to work.	Imma xejn ma jidher li jaħdem.
I will do my best to be with you.	Jien se nagħmel minn kollox biex inkun miegħek.
I will be out for a while.	Inkun barra għal xi żmien.
He said it was good.	Qal li kienet tajba.
I will think about it.	Se naħseb dwar dan.
It was pretty hard to see.	Kien pjuttost li tara.
This is not so.	Dan mhux hekk.
But let’s get here.	Imma ejja hawn.
I don’t do that.	Jien ma nagħmel hekk.
I did now.	Għamilt issa.
That wasn’t exactly it at all.	Dak ma kienx eżatt għal kollox.
You know what you’re getting.	Taf x'qed tieħu.
Never a problem.	Qatt problema.
He can say no if he wants to.	Jista’ jgħid le jekk irid.
He was happy all the time.	Kien kuntent il-ħin kollu.
Something we have to do.	Xi ħaġa li għandna nagħmlu.
Definitely not the same thing.	Żgur li mhux l-istess ħaġa.
It was all one for him.	Kien kollu wieħed għalih.
He said he wasn't, but he could.	Huwa qal li ma kienx, imma jista '.
We'll do what you say.	Aħna ser nagħmlu dak li tgħid.
How beautiful she was.	Kemm kienet sabiħa.
He lives alone.	Jgħix waħdu.
I'm going home.	Jien se mmur id-dar.
That can happen.	Li jista' jiġri.
I want us to do.	Nixtieq li nagħmlu.
I will try this.	Se nipprova dan.
No time now.	L-ebda ħin issa.
No, he had been thinking everything.	Le, kien ilu jaħseb kollox.
I can tell there.	Nista 'ngħid hemmhekk.
And he lost almost everything.	U tilef kważi kollox.
It would have been good.	Kieku kienet tajba.
I was in the back room.	Jien kont fil-kamra ta’ wara.
They are so.	Huma hekk.
And this is good.	U dan huwa tajjeb.
How much is each person.	Kemm hi kull persuna.
I think no one does.	Naħseb li ħadd ma jagħmel.
You do what you do.	Inti tagħmel dak li tagħmel.
It wasn’t good either.	Ma kienx tajjeb lanqas.
That was probably a bad idea.	Dik probabbilment kienet idea ħażina.
He was there alone.	Kien hemm waħdu.
But that’s great if.	Imma dak hu kbir jekk.
I can do so much.	Jien nista' nagħmel daqshekk.
he had said.	kien qal.
That was the first.	Dak kien l-ewwel.
You can't do that.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan hekk.
It comes on.	Jiġi fuq.
He looks like a good man.	Jidher bħal raġel tajjeb.
We don’t have that anymore.	M'għandniex dan aktar.
Don’t make friends.	M'għandekx tagħmel ħbieb.
We are better.	Aħna aħjar.
It was very easy.	Kienet faċli ħafna.
The timing was good.	Iż-żmien kien tajjeb.
And she can.	U hi tista '.
No one can do this for you.	Ħadd ma jista’ jagħmel dan għalik.
All very well.	Kollox tajjeb ħafna.
Too, maybe.	Wisq, forsi.
I think you should too.	Naħseb li għandek ukoll.
I was glad he was with me.	Kont ferħan li kien miegħi.
The same will happen here.	L-istess se jiġri hawn.
He just didn’t know what to do.	Huwa biss ma kienx jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
I am very sorry now.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna issa.
It can't be there.	Ma jistax ikun hemm.
And you know you don’t have that.	U taf li m'għandekx dan.
I want you to come with me.	Irrid li tiġi miegħi.
But that wasn’t all there was to it.	Imma dan ma kienx kollu li kien hemm.
This is where we are currently.	Dan huwa fejn aħna bħalissa.
No one seemed to know what to do.	Ħadd ma deher li kien jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
Nothing was happening.	Ma kien qed jiġri xejn.
Well, that was done.	Ukoll, li sar dan.
Or with someone.	Jew ma’ xi ħadd.
That was just it.	Hekk kien biss.
But you can't.	Imma ma tistax.
It seems you can’t do that anymore.	Jidher li ma tistax tagħmel dan aktar.
I hope he is.	Nispera li se.
There are more people now, and more money.	Hemm aktar nies issa, u aktar flus.
This is not what you want to do.	Dan mhuwiex dak li trid tagħmel.
I am reluctant to say that always so.	Jiena noqgħod lura milli ngħid li dejjem hekk.
Maybe he hadn’t told me.	Forsi ma kienx qalli.
All that they were.	Dak kollu li kienu.
I'm doing much better.	Jien sejjer ħafna aħjar.
And you.	U int.
And it’s not hard to see why.	U mhux diffiċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
He was more than tired.	Kien aktar minn għajjien.
The last time he played, someone had died.	L-aħħar darba li kellu, kien miet xi ħadd.
And we know the following.	U nafu li ġej.
It’s great, really.	Huwa kbir, tassew.
She was more tired than ever lately.	Kienet għajjien aktar minn qatt qabel dan l-aħħar.
And it’s a great idea.	U hija idea kbira.
He really didn’t know.	Huwa tassew ma kienx jaf.
He is a big boy.	Huwa tifel kbir.
Never, ever have I seen this happen.	Qatt, qatt ma rajt dan jiġri.
He never was.	Hu qatt ma kien.
I’m sure it wasn’t.	Jien ċert li ma kienx.
If it weren’t so, it wouldn’t be so.	Kieku ma kienx hekk, ma kienx hekk.
If anything, he seemed a little tired.	Jekk xejn, deher ftit għajjien.
It would be so.	Ikun hekk.
But it won’t happen again.	Imma mhux se jiġri aktar.
It could be.	Huwa jista 'jkun.
But it could be ours.	Imma jista’ jkun tagħna.
It's all his.	Huwa kollu tiegħu.
Something wrong, something wrong.	Xi ħaġa ħażina, xi ħaġa ħażina.
It can happen.	Huwa jista 'jiġri.
Yours alone.	Tiegħek waħdek.
But you did well.	Imma int għamilt tajjeb.
I wish I was here.	Nixtieq li kont hawn.
I have no idea why it happens.	M'għandi l-ebda idea għaliex jiġri.
For once, his time was good.	Għal darba, il-ħin tiegħu kien tajjeb.
I’m glad this happened.	Jien kuntent li ġara dan.
It was not yet noon.	Kien għadu ma kienx nofsinhar.
I need to be alone.	Għandi bżonn inkun waħdi.
I need to listen.	Għandi bżonn nisma.
Maybe there are enough people to do it.	Forsi hemm biżżejjed nies li jagħmlu dan.
He had no idea what to do.	Huwa ma kellux idea x'għandu jagħmel.
It was really good.	Kien tassew tajjeb.
If nothing else.	Jekk xejn aktar.
We knew one was coming.	Konna nafu li wieħed kien ġej.
I knew it.	Jien kont naf li.
It’s still something that’s still there.	Għadha ħaġa li għadha hemmhekk.
Nobody really knows what happened.	Ħadd ma jaf tassew x’ġara.
And it’s always the same.	U huwa dejjem l-istess.
But no one wants that.	Imma ħadd ma jrid hekk.
Now there was.	Issa kien hemm.
He is not saying no.	Mhux qed jgħid le.
I’ve just waited and hoped.	Stajt biss nistenna u nittama.
As she was.	Kif kienet hi.
It was bad enough the first time.	Kien ħażin biżżejjed l-ewwel darba.
But you’re going to do something much better.	Imma int ser tagħmel xi ħaġa ħafna aħjar.
It has always been so.	Dejjem kien hekk.
But he knew he couldn’t.	Imma kien jaf li ma setax.
They do it.	Huma jagħmlu dan.
And it wasn’t there.	U ma kienx hemm.
That you now have.	Li issa għandek.
I have never seen anything like this before.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din qabel.
I can't hear.	Ma nistax nisma.
I could tell.	Seta’ kont naf.
Like it was nothing.	Bħal ma kien xejn.
Now she never was.	Issa hi qatt ma kienet.
Or it could be the same.	Jew jista 'jkun l-istess.
He was a really good man.	Kien raġel tassew tajjeb.
There was more.	Kien hemm aktar.
But we will not go there.	Imma mhux se mmorru hemm.
Don't think that.	M'għandekx taħseb li.
It won’t be too long.	Mhux se jkun twil wisq.
In addition, there is another problem.	Barra minn hekk, hemm problema oħra.
We were going to go back.	Konna se mmorru lura.
Maybe he would do it after all, he thought.	Forsi kien jagħmel wara kollox, ħaseb.
And now, with that.	U issa, b'dan .
That was something we had to do.	Dik kienet xi ħaġa li kellna nagħmlu.
I'm not enough.	Jien mhux biżżejjed.
It was all work.	Kien kollu xogħol.
I need some help for this.	Għandi bżonn xi għajnuna għal dan.
But you say.	Imma int tgħid.
But you have to go now.	Imma trid tmur issa.
First, it won’t help.	L-ewwel, mhux se jgħin.
He had never been outside before.	Hu qatt ma mar barra qabel.
It is so.	Huwa hekk.
But that’s what you want.	Imma dak hu li trid.
I actually thought it all out.	Fil-fatt ħsibt dan kollu.
Now they were out.	Issa kienu barra.
Or it will do.	Jew se tagħmel.
There is more to see.	Hemm aktar x'tara.
Just not like before.	Biss mhux bħal qabel.
And she says this is a problem.	U tgħid li din hija problema.
You did everything.	Inti għamilt dak kollu.
You don't have to.	Inti m'għandekx.
Too late.	Tard wisq.
And this was a great one.	U din kienet waħda kbira.
He was a bit surprised.	Huwa kien daqsxejn sorpriż.
He is the one who says so.	Huwa hu dak li jgħid hekk.
He is a good friend.	Huwa ħabib tajjeb.
I don’t want to just now but always.	Ma rridx issa biss imma dejjem.
It couldn't have been.	Ma setax kien.
It seemed very easy.	Deher faċli ħafna.
So she thinks.	Hekk taħseb hi.
I know it would be hard for me.	Naf li jkun diffiċli għalija.
Someone to know.	Xi ħadd li tkun taf.
You know, it’s not my idea.	Taf, mhix idea tiegħi.
I would be scared of him there.	Inkun nibża miegħu hemmhekk.
I was happy there, very happy.	Kont kuntent hemmhekk, kuntent ħafna.
He would have to try.	Kien ikollu jipprova.
I'm just so hard.	Jien biss diffiċli hekk.
No it wasn't.	Le ma kienx.
He did everything he could.	Kien għamel dak kollu li seta’.
Or he thought he needed to.	Jew ħaseb li kellu bżonn.
He said he was alone.	Qal li kien waħdu.
He was my good friend.	Kien ħabib tajjeb tiegħi.
I’m scared for myself.	Nibża għalija.
This could be anyone.	Dan jista 'jkun xi ħadd.
In fact, it almost never happens.	Fil-fatt, kważi qatt ma jiġri.
He needs money.	Huwa għandu bżonn flus.
Also, it will not work.	Barra minn hekk, mhux se jaħdem.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
He took to.	Huwa ħa għal.
Nothing can happen.	Xejn ma jista' jiġri.
It will never be enough.	Qatt ma jkun biżżejjed.
Your first job is not your last job.	L-ewwel xogħol tiegħek mhuwiex l-aħħar xogħol tiegħek.
For many people, this is easy too.	Għal ħafna nies, dan huwa faċli wisq.
He did not want to see.	Ma riedx jara.
But so is he.	Imma hekk hu.
We can do both.	Nistgħu nagħmlu t-tnejn.
What she was doing there.	Dak li kienet qed tagħmel hemmhekk.
That’s a long time from now.	Dak huwa żmien twil minn issa.
In fact, it already has.	Fil-fatt, diġà għandu.
And always so.	U dejjem hekk.
There wasn’t much to see.	Ma kienx hemm ħafna x'tara.
I wasn’t there.	Jien ma kontx hemm.
And it was a little too much.	U kien ftit wisq.
Usually enough to get the job done.	Normalment biżżejjed biex isir ix-xogħol.
It was beautiful to see.	Kienet sabiħa li tara.
Come on, you can go to school here.	Ejja, tista' tmur l-iskola hawn.
I don’t do that now.	Jien ma nagħmel hekk issa.
I'm interested.	Jien interessat.
I never had the money to do so.	Qatt ma kelli flus biex nagħmel hekk.
But there is no way to go back there.	Imma m'hemm l-ebda mod kif tmur lura hemm.
It's still there.	Għadu hemm.
But not supposed to.	Imma mhux suppost.
But you want to talk to me.	Imma trid titkellem miegħi.
She was speaking very fast.	Kienet titkellem malajr ħafna.
Definitely should be.	Żgur li għandu jkun.
I needed to believe.	Kelli bżonn nemmen.
I think everything.	Naħseb li kollox.
This is a pretty good size.	Dan huwa daqs pjuttost tajjeb.
No one ever does that.	Ħadd qatt ma jagħmel hekk.
I think a lot of people here do.	Naħseb li ħafna nies hawn jagħmlu.
But my friend here is all that.	Imma ħabib tiegħi hawn huwa dak kollu.
He must know something.	Għandu jkun jaf xi ħaġa.
It won't be long.	Ma jkunx twil.
It's really late there.	Huwa verament tard hemmhekk.
This if not all of them.	Dan jekk mhux kollha kemm huma.
And she’ll say no, no.	U hi ser tgħid le, mhux.
This can be.	Dan jista 'jkun.
Let's sit down.	Ejja bilqiegħda.
There is nothing to do.	M'hemm xejn tagħmel.
Maybe, maybe not.	Forsi, forsi le.
You do a good job.	Inti tagħmel xogħol tajjeb.
I didn’t know where it came from exactly.	Ma kontx naf minn fejn ġie eżatt.
Neither do I.	Lanqas lili.
It wasn’t usually a problem.	Normalment ma kinitx problema.
He was very good to me.	Kien tajjeb ħafna miegħi.
Always with me.	Dejjem miegħi.
He came back after a while.	Ġie lura wara ftit żmien.
He didn’t want to know, but he was.	Ma riedx ikun jaf, imma kien.
I'm going to do something else.	Jien ser nagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
I would like to do that one again soon.	Nixtieq nerġa' nagħmel dak wieħed dalwaqt.
It would take a lot of money, to do it properly.	Dan ikun jieħu ħafna flus, li tagħmel dan kif suppost.
Just another thing.	Ħaġa oħra biss.
He could see that.	Huwa seta 'jara li.
Too late, too late.	Tard wisq, tard wisq.
She didn’t have to say anything.	Ma kellha tgħid xejn.
This is pretty easy to see.	Dan huwa pjuttost faċli biex tara.
I wanted to do something that could make some money.	Ridt nagħmel xi ħaġa li tista 'tagħmel xi flus.
Once we were friends.	Darba konna ħbieb.
Not many things, but some things.	Mhux ħafna affarijiet, imma xi affarijiet.
Everyone who was supposed to be here was.	Kulħadd li kellu jkun hawn kien.
It seemed easy too.	Deher faċli wisq.
To a man.	Lil raġel.
You have to be like that, okay.	Trid tkun hekk, tajjeb.
I know there can be many.	Naf li jista’ jkun hemm ħafna.
But this will happen.	Imma dan se jiġri.
He was not expecting this.	Huwa ma kienx jistenna dan.
I will definitely do this again.	Żgur li se nerġa' nagħmel dan.
He's afraid it's too much or not enough.	Jibża’ li jkun wisq jew mhux biżżejjed.
But here.	Imma hawn.
And if so, it will never be the same.	U jekk hekk, qatt mhu se jkun l-istess.
You may want to be sure.	Inti tista 'tixtieq li tkun ċert.
She knew that now.	Hija kienet taf li issa.
Nothing is being done.	Mhu qed isir xejn.
Quickly, and back.	Malajr, u lura.
Maybe it was someone who had money.	Forsi kien xi ħadd li kellu flus.
It seemed like a lot of work.	Deher qisu ħafna xogħol.
You did us wrong.	Int għamilna ħażin.
It was really beautiful.	Kienet tassew sabiħa.
This is not me.	Dan mhux jien jien.
I can't see.	Ma nistax nara.
That would be better than that.	Dan ikun aħjar minn dan.
It may be late or it may be soon.	Jista’ jiġi tard jew jista’ jiġi dalwaqt.
But he knows one thing.	Imma jaf ħaġa waħda.
It should work for us.	Għandu jaħdem għalina.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
You just see all these things.	Inti biss tara dawn l-affarijiet kollha.
What we have is working.	Dak li għandna qed jaħdem.
Now good.	Issa tajjeb.
But there was nothing, nothing.	Imma ma kien hemm xejn, xejn.
She wants to appear.	Hija trid tidher.
It's easy to see that.	Huwa faċli li tara dan.
It won’t be long now.	Mhux se jkun twil issa.
Now it seems to do.	Issa jidher li jagħmlu.
Too early.	Wisq kmieni.
It's not easy.	Mhix faċli.
Or whatever.	Jew tkun xi tkun.
Or you can do something.	Jew tista 'tagħmel xi ħaġa.
I'm surprised how long.	Jien sorpriż li kemm żmien.
Sar.	Sar.
He started at home.	Beda d-dar.
I’m not even sure they were.	Jien lanqas ċert li kienu.
It's been a long time.	Ilu żmien twil.
Tomorrow may also be yesterday.	Għada jista' jkun ukoll il-bieraħ.
No, there is nothing to say so.	Le, m'hemm xejn li tgħid hekk.
He will come alone.	Se jiġi waħdu.
And so he did.	U hekk għamel.
Maybe not for you, but for me.	Forsi mhux għalik, imma għalija.
I’m still not sure.	Għadni m'inix ċert.
You know that.	Taf li .
No one was there.	Ħadd ma kien hemm.
There really is nothing he is doing for you.	Verament m'hemm xejn li qed tagħmel għalik.
It took a long time to get here.	Ħa ħafna żmien biex wasal hawn.
Try it if you haven’t already.	Ipprova jekk ma tkunx diġà.
It seemed like a lot of fun.	Deher qisu gost kbir.
It was a chance he had to take.	Kien ċans li kellu jieħu.
And he will be with us forever.	U hu se jibqa’ magħna għal dejjem ta’ dejjem.
But so, my friend.	Imma hekk, ħabib tiegħi.
You need to eat.	Għandek bżonn tiekol.
But he had none.	Imma ma kellu l-ebda.
It can be a little long.	Jista 'jkun ftit twil.
I never did that.	Qatt ma għamilt dan.
I need someone else.	Għandi bżonn xi ħadd ieħor.
The whole school one.	L-iskola waħda kollha.
It must have looked like one, too.	Għandu jkun deher bħal wieħed, ukoll.
He could not live like that.	Ma setax jgħix hekk.
He could not see anyone.	Ma seta’ jara lil ħadd.
Let me be small.	Ħa nkun żgħir.
He doesn’t want to eat anything, alone.	Ma jridx jiekol xi ħaġa, waħdu.
Not a lot of money.	Mhux ħafna flus.
That he knew.	Dan kien jaf.
It's all back.	Huwa kollu lura.
Everything was never good.	Kollox qatt ma kien tajjeb.
It is still there.	Għadu qiegħed hemm.
That was the problem, he knew.	Dik kienet il-problema, kien jaf.
This will not do for us.	Dan mhux se jagħmel għalina.
That was me.	Dak kont jien.
It was about.	Kien madwar.
You only speak the truth.	Int titkellem il-verità biss.
And, maybe he did.	U, forsi huwa għamel.
Not sure there is but who knows.	Mhux ċert li hemm imma min jaf.
A friend is right about that.	Ħabib għandu raġun dwar dan.
That's not me.	Dak mhux jien.
I should have known that.	I kellha naf li.
Everyone knows what happened.	Kulħadd jaf x’ġara.
And it still does.	U għadu jagħmel.
This posed a bit of a problem.	Dan poġġa xi ftit problema.
It will be again then.	Qed jerġa’ jkun dak iż-żmien.
I don't hear anymore.	Jien ma nisma' aktar.
For us, that was that.	Għalina, dak kien dak.
This still works.	Dan għadu jaħdem.
You will not.	Inti mhux se.
It is something you should know.	Hija xi ħaġa li għandek tkun taf.
I had one once.	Kelli waħda darba jien.
Many, many people have these.	Ħafna, ħafna nies għandhom dawn.
It's good where it is.	Huwa tajjeb fejn ikun.
This is not a bad thing, of course.	Din mhix xi ħaġa ħażina, ovvjament.
But now he knew it was more than that.	Imma issa kien jaf li kien aktar minn hekk.
He would be too tired.	Ikun għajjien wisq.
We spent many hours there.	Għamilna ħafna sigħat hemmhekk.
Anyone can talk.	Kulħadd jista’ jitkellem.
It was good for him that they were there.	Kien tajjeb għalih li kienu hemm.
We had very little money.	Ftit li xejn kellna flus.
It's about to go on.	Wasal biex tmur fuq.
Someone to play at home with.	Xi ħadd biex jilgħab id-dar miegħu.
He took everyone home if he wanted to.	Ħa lil kulħadd id-dar tiegħu jekk irid.
And he couldn’t do that.	U ma setax jagħmel dan.
He would have to try another.	Huwa jkollu jipprova ieħor.
You’re the same person I’ve always been.	Int l-istess persuna li dejjem kont.
Everything they do was great.	Dak kollu li jagħmlu kien kbir.
I'm going to need some.	Jien ser ikolli bżonn xi ftit.
That I know enough.	Dan naf biżżejjed.
Both are right and both are wrong.	It-tnejn għandhom raġun u t-tnejn ħażin.
It looks like this.	Jidher bħal dan.
Not that anyone can try anything, of course.	Mhux li xi ħadd jista’ jipprova xi ħaġa, ovvjament.
No one knew why.	Ħadd ma kien jaf għaliex.
We want everyone to be the same.	Irridu li kulħadd ikun l-istess.
His only chance was to keep talking.	L-uniku ċans tiegħu kien li jibqa’ jitkellem.
Now I know he doesn’t think anything.	Issa naf li ma jaħsibx xejn.
Worried for him.	Inkwetat għalih.
And that, of course, is good for me.	U dan, ovvjament, huwa tajjeb miegħi.
Probably not, but who knows, maybe they will.	Probabbilment le, imma min jaf, forsi jagħmlu.
And this is not easy.	U dan mhux faċli.
But he had gone back.	Imma kien mar lura.
Obviously, this can be difficult.	Ovvjament, dan jista 'jkun diffiċli.
He didn’t want to talk about anything.	Ma ried jitkellem dwar xejn.
Sorry to say something.	Jiddispjaċini li ngħid xi ħaġa.
Another good man did.	Raġel ieħor tajjeb għamel.
A little of everything really.	Ftit minn kollox verament.
Other things were there as well.	Affarijiet oħra kien hemm ukoll.
It’s just us there.	Huwa biss magħna hemmhekk.
I can’t do anything more.	Ma nista nagħmel xejn aktar.
One may be right for you.	Wieħed jista 'jkun eżatt għalik.
I don’t know how long we do this.	Ma nafx għal kemm żmien nagħmlu dan.
Of what you will do.	Ta 'dak li inti ser tagħmel.
It was so you, so you.	Kien hekk int, hekk int.
You are right, we did it.	Għandek raġun, għamilna dan.
It has always been so and always so.	Hekk dejjem kien u dejjem hekk.
They will not make enough money.	Huma mhux se jagħmlu biżżejjed flus.
Well, not for a while.	Ukoll, mhux għal xi żmien.
It would be great.	Ikun kbir.
You’re pretty right, of course.	Int pjuttost raġun, ovvjament.
Everyone will make way for you now.	Kulħadd se jagħmel mod għalik issa.
I want it to happen more often.	Nixtieq li jiġri aktar spiss.
You can’t do everything you want here.	Ma tistax tagħmel dak kollu li trid hawn.
Every little bit helps.	Kull ftit jgħin.
It wasn’t a good time for me.	Ma kienx żmien tajjeb għalija.
He is doing his best.	Qed jagħmel minn kollox.
And from what I've already done.	U ta’ dak li diġà għamilt.
Something else and one thing.	Xi ħaġa oħra u ħaġa waħda.
I wasn’t good.	Jien ma kontx tajjeb.
I don’t think so.	Ma naħsibx.
He wasn’t doing anything like that.	Ma kienx jagħmel xi ħaġa bħal dik.
But who really knows.	Imma min verament jaf.
You were just a small child.	Inti kont tifel żgħir biss.
But it never does.	Imma dan qatt ma jagħmel.
Everything will be great.	Kollox se jkun kbir.
I want the time alone to think.	Irrid il-ħin waħdi biex naħseb.
He needed this.	Huwa kellu bżonn dan.
Not much you can do about it.	Mhux ħafna inti tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
You can see everything happen.	Tista 'tara kollox jiġri.
I see how it goes.	Nara kif imur.
I want you to know one thing.	Irrid li tkun taf ħaġa waħda.
Every time that happens.	Kull darba li jiġri.
Now, just a few hours later, there isn’t.	Issa, ftit sigħat biss wara, mhux hemm.
If you are unsure.	Jekk m'intix ċert.
She sees you happy, too.	Hija tara inti kuntent, ukoll.
Nothing was worth trying.	Xejn kien ta 'min jipprova.
In fact, he said nothing.	Fil-fatt, ma qal xejn.
There should be a little more.	Għandu jkun hemm xi ftit aktar.
But someone wants to talk.	Imma xi ħadd irid jitkellem.
Or be both.	Jew tkun it-tnejn.
That certainly wasn’t me.	Li żgur ma kontx jien.
And often, they are.	U ħafna drabi, huma.
You can take this a little further.	Inti tista 'tieħu dan ftit aktar.
But this is not going to happen.	Imma dan mhux sejjer.
But there will definitely be a better way.	Imma żgur li jkun hemm mod aħjar.
This would take a while.	Dan kien jieħu ftit.
How right she was.	Kemm kellha raġun.
Glad you're here.	Ferħan int hawn.
And, it’s not an easy one.	U, mhix waħda faċli.
But he was not surprised.	Imma ma kienx sorpriż.
And look, too.	U ħares, ukoll.
I see you.	Nara li int.
I’m never sure what you want.	Jien qatt ma ċert minn dak li trid.
But no one has ever done that before.	Imma ħadd qatt ma għamel dan qabel.
He had gone outside.	Huwa kien mar barra.
I want us to always be together.	Irrid li nkunu dejjem flimkien.
And she was right.	U kellha raġun.
And so it was.	U hekk kien.
But he is good.	Imma hu tajjeb.
Not so often, of course.	Mhux daqshekk spiss, ovvjament.
I don’t really know.	Ma nafx tassew.
But now it seemed that maybe it was.	Imma issa deher li forsi kien.
It was easy too.	Ġie faċli wisq.
Someone was here already.	Xi ħadd kien hawn diġà.
No, that's not me.	Le, dak mhux jien.
Everyone loves something they can’t have.	Kulħadd iħobb xi ħaġa li ma jistax ikollu.
We were outside.	Konna konna barra.
And that’s about it.	U dan huwa dwar dan.
And not always with me.	U mhux dejjem miegħi.
Nor.	U lanqas.
I’m pretty alone here.	Jiena pjuttost waħdi hawn.
They were such things.	Kienu affarijiet bħal dawn.
I just want both.	Irrid biss it-tnejn.
I can hardly believe it.	Jien ma tantx nista' nemmen li jien.
I'm already home.	Jien diġà d-dar.
I had a lot to say to everyone.	Kelli ħafna xi ngħid lil kulħadd.
Maybe, after all, it hadn’t come too late.	Forsi, wara kollox, ma kienx wasal tard wisq.
It's after every bit of it.	Huwa wara kull ftit ta 'dan.
But it won’t do.	Imma mhux se tagħmel.
If something happens.	Jekk jiġri xi ħaġa.
It didn’t have to be that way.	Ma kellux ikun hekk.
He is, after all, what he seems to be.	Hu, wara kollox, dak li jidher li hu.
And it was really great.	U kien tassew kbir.
Glad he made it home.	Ferħan li għamel id-dar.
I have some money.	Ikolli xi flus.
I’m not going to talk about money.	Mhux se nitkellem dwar flus.
It's been a long time.	Ilu żmien.
If not, no problem.	Jekk le, l-ebda problema.
But there was no one else to do it.	Imma ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor biex jagħmel dan.
But this is not so.	Imma dan mhux hekk.
I wanted my friend to be with me.	Ridt li ħabib tiegħi jkun miegħi.
Eating was good.	Tiekol kien tajjeb.
We both know that, 'he said.	Dan it-tnejn nafu,’ qal.
Or maybe he is.	Jew forsi hu.
He wasn’t the only one wearing it.	Ma kienx l-uniku liebes.
That was probably a year ago now.	Dan probabbilment kien sena ilu issa.
First, what it is not.	L-ewwel, dak li mhuwiex.
I think that’s my last time.	Naħseb li dik hija l-aħħar darba tiegħi.
As it is.	Hekk kif hi.
We are so tired.	Aħna tant għajjien.
This happens a lot in fact.	Dan jiġri ħafna fil-fatt.
The dog came.	Il-kelb daħal.
And maybe it’s a bit easier.	U forsi huwa daqsxejn aktar faċli.
He has you.	Huwa għandu inti.
And pretty quickly, actually.	U pjuttost malajr, fil-fatt.
I want me all with him all.	Irrid lili kollha miegħu kollu.
Well, it would be worth a try.	Ukoll, ikun ta 'min jipprova.
I’m not sure how to do that.	M'inix ċert kif tagħmel dan.
Almost there! 	Kważi hemm!
No one knows the truth now.	Ħadd ma jaf il-verità issa.
You are thinking about all this wrong.	Qed taħseb dwar dan kollu ħażin.
Everything was fast.	Kollox kien malajr.
But all is not well.	Imma kollox mhux tajjeb.
Now he knew what to do.	Issa kien jaf x’għandu jagħmel.
You thought so too.	Inti ħsibt hekk ukoll.
It could have been nothing.	Seta’ kien xejn.
I just wanted to be.	Jien biss ridt inkun.
We did a very good job.	Għamilna xogħol tajjeb ħafna.
I don’t need to see anything.	M'għandi bżonn nara xejn.
Well, there it was.	Ukoll, kienet hemm.
It may be working.	Jista 'jkun qed jaħdem.
We always have been.	Dejjem konna.
Everything is still there.	Kollox għadu hemm.
It happens, everything.	Jiġri, dak kollu.
They are just.	Huma biss.
It just doesn't happen.	Huwa biss ma jiġri.
Why she did it.	Għaliex għamlet dan.
I'm sorry everyone.	Jiddispjaċini kulħadd.
Now I know better.	Issa naf aħjar.
.	.
I would, too.	Inkun, ukoll.
I'm not sure.	miniex ċert.
I'm who I am.	Jien min jien.
We are together.	Aħna flimkien.
Or maybe not.	Jew forsi le.
There could be someone better.	Jista’ jkun hemm xi ħadd aħjar.
She had to be with him.	Kellha tkun miegħu.
I sat down.	I poġġa bilqiegħda.
I really just want to be happy.	Verament irrid biss li jkun kuntent.
There never happens anything good.	Hemm qatt ma jiġri xejn tajjeb.
I would probably go with that.	I probabbilment immur ma 'dak.
This always happens.	Dan dejjem jiġri.
It just happened too fast.	Ġara biss malajr wisq.
Monday after school.	It-Tnejn wara l-iskola.
Until then there was no time.	Sa dak iż-żmien ma kienx hemm ħin.
It was bad.	Kienet ħażina.
Did you know this was coming.	Kont taf li dan kien ġej.
That's a bit behind.	Dak daqsxejn lura.
Not so small.	Mhux daqshekk żgħir.
When we are outside, we are outside.	Meta nkunu barra, aħna barra.
But not from this.	Imma mhux minn dan.
Little in fact.	Ftit fil-fatt.
You did very, very well with this one.	Inti għamilt tajjeb ħafna, ħafna ma 'dan wieħed.
He knew everything.	Kien jaf kollox.
I don't have the time.	M'għandix il-ħin.
There would be good, there would be bad.	Ikun hemm tajjeb, ikun hemm ħażin.
Look around here today.	Ħares madwar hawn illum.
I was not surprised.	Ma kontx sorpriż.
It’s something we do together.	Hija xi ħaġa li nagħmlu flimkien.
Things happen.	Jiġri l-affarijiet.
There was really very little he needed to say.	Kien hemm verament ftit li xejn kellu bżonn jgħid.
But she had to go.	Imma kellha tmur.
What you knew was right.	Dak li kont taf li hu tajjeb.
I try.	Nipprova.
I have never seen anything like that before.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal dik qabel.
I have to go home, he said.	Ikolli mmur id-dar, qal.
She was just a little boy.	Kienet biss tifel żgħir.
But maybe that was better.	Imma forsi dan kien aħjar.
And she needed my help.	U li kellha bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħi.
It's really easy.	Huwa tassew faċli.
I go to school.	Jien immur l-iskola.
I love to do and be and think.	Inħobb nagħmel u nkun u naħseb.
Maybe he wouldn’t have.	Forsi ma kienx ikollu.
They were almost home.	Kienu kważi d-dar.
You are a friend.	Inti ħabib.
It couldn’t be happier.	Ma jistax ikun aktar ferħan.
How could my friends say that too?	Kif seta’ jmur jgħid hekk ukoll ħbieb tiegħi.
Not so now.	Mhux hekk issa.
All this without speaking.	Dan kollu mingħajr ma titkellem.
But not everything.	Imma mhux kollox.
I'm not going to go there.	Jien mhux se mmur hemm.
I need to do something.	Għandi bżonn li jagħmel xi ħaġa.
Maybe he’s always trying.	Forsi dejjem ikun qed jipprova.
He wanted to.	Ried.
I can’t wait to go all the time.	Ma nistax nistenna li jmur il-ħin kollu.
We can’t do that anymore.	Ma nistgħux nagħmlu dan aktar.
In addition, it needs to be so.	Barra minn hekk, jeħtieġ li jkun hekk.
It could be your job.	Jista 'jkun ix-xogħol tiegħek.
Good to know you don’t want it anymore.	Tajjeb taf li ma tridx aktar.
You stay there.	Inti toqgħod hemm.
And another thing.	U ħaġa oħra.
Tom may be able to.	Tom jista 'jkun kapaċi.
She wants to do so as well.	Hija trid li tagħmel hekk ukoll.
That’s not really what he said.	Dan mhuwiex verament dak li qal.
Everything happened so fast.	Kollox ġara hekk malajr.
It is very difficult now.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna issa.
He seems a capable enough man.	Jidher raġel kapaċi biżżejjed.
He doesn’t want you to think about it.	Hu ma jridx li taħseb dwarha.
I’m not so sure about everything.	Jien mhux daqshekk ċert dwar kollox.
It hasn't been long.	Ilu ma tantx.
So was his house.	Hekk kienet id-dar tiegħu.
It was supposed to be in the afternoon.	Kellu jkun wara nofsinhar.
But they were all too late.	Imma kienu kollha tard wisq.
I had to be.	Kelli nkun.
Only you weren’t there.	Biss int ma kontx hemm.
Maybe they are both.	Forsi t-tnejn li huma.
He would have nowhere to go if he were outside.	Ma kienx ikollu fejn imur kieku kien barra.
I don’t know anything about that.	Jien ma naf xejn dwar dan.
But it didn’t have to be that hard.	Imma ma kellux ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
My not so good.	Tiegħi mhux daqshekk tajjeb.
He still does his thing.	Għadu jagħmel ħaġa tiegħu.
It was very small.	Kien żgħir ħafna.
If there is one.	Jekk hemm wieħed.
Not fast enough.	Mhux malajr biżżejjed.
And last evening.	U l-aħħar filgħaxija.
I see where he goes.	Nara fejn imur.
It still helps.	Għadu jgħin.
Besides.	Barra minn kollox.
We do a lot of things.	Nagħmlu ħafna affarijiet.
Not for me.	Mhux għalija.
This he asked for today as well.	Dan talab illum ukoll.
Out with you.	Barra miegħek.
It shouldn’t have been there.	Ma kellux ikun hemm.
We both need it.	It-tnejn għandna bżonn.
Or it should be.	Jew għandu jkun.
Good! 	Tajjeb!
He never needed anything.	Qatt ma kellu bżonn xejn.
It's just above.	Huwa biss hawn fuq.
Too many people are doing this.	Wisq nies qed jagħmlu dan.
It has not always been so.	Mhux dejjem kien hekk.
It wasn’t much he had to do.	Ma kienx ħafna li kellu jagħmel.
I knew it could happen.	Kont naf li jista’ jiġri.
Now I have a better job.	Issa għandi xogħol aħjar.
But of course, that’s me.	Imma ovvjament, dak għalija.
It wouldn’t have been hard to do.	Ma kienx ikun diffiċli li tagħmel.
Everyone has one.	Kulħadd għandu wieħed.
Or maybe there was more to it.	Jew forsi kien hemm aktar minn hekk.
This may not be long.	Dan jista 'ma jkunx twil.
Someone had gone to stay.	Xi ħadd kien mar joqgħod.
It's a lot.	Huwa ħafna.
Come back now.	Ejja lura issa.
I couldn’t say for sure.	Ma setax ngħid għal ċert.
He never did and never will.	Qatt ma għamel u qatt ma se.
No, no, this is wrong.	Le, le, dan huwa ħażin.
He definitely needed help.	Żgur li kellu bżonn l-għajnuna.
Probably not what you want.	Probabbilment mhux dak li trid.
And someone else.	U xi ħadd ieħor.
Well, you have it.	Ukoll, għandek dan.
Which is really great.	Li huwa tassew kbir.
He is afraid of what might happen.	Jibża’ minn dak li jista’ jiġri.
He was watching.	Kien jara.
Three years later, he died.	Tliet snin wara, miet.
This does not look like it will be ready for tomorrow.	Dan ma jidhirx li se jkun lest għal għada.
It should be so, but it’s not.	Għandu jkun hekk, imma mhux.
I think someone came.	Naħseb li xi ħadd daħal.
And he had already completely lost time.	U kien diġà tilef għal kollox il-ħin.
Maybe just a little.	Forsi biss ftit.
No one really took to it.	Ħadd verament ħa għalih.
It was easy.	Kien faċli.
How these two.	Kif dawn it-tnejn.
I do something wrong.	Nagħmel xi ħaġa ħażina.
I definitely had a good time.	Żgur li kelli żmien tajjeb.
But we will be.	Imma se nkunu.
He had done.	Huwa kien għamel.
That everything helps.	Li kollox jgħin.
I can't say when.	Ma nistax ngħid meta.
This should not be so difficult.	Dan m'għandux ikun daqshekk diffiċli.
Bad bad bad bad.	Ħażin ħażin ħażin.
It helps more than you know.	Dan jgħin aktar milli taf.
And you have your own home.	U għandek id-dar tiegħek.
And we were tired.	U konna għajjien.
For me, it is.	Għalija, huwa.
This must be done once.	Dan irid isir darba.
Well it wasn’t enough.	Tajjeb ma kienx biżżejjed.
I need a better way to do this.	Għandi bżonn mod aħjar kif nagħmel dan.
Ours is not.	Tagħna mhux.
I want you to be surprised as well.	Nixtieq li inti tkun sorpriż ukoll.
But you're better.	Imma int aħjar.
I wanted my book.	Jien ridt il-ktieb tiegħi.
All this alone.	Dan kollu biss.
And she is with me here.	U hi miegħi hawn.
It's been out there.	Ilu hemm barra.
But it didn’t have to be that way.	Imma ma kellux ikun hekk.
I really hope you so.	Verament nittama li inti hekk.
That’s his thing.	Dik hi ħaġa tiegħu.
And it actually works.	U fil-fatt jaħdem.
I’ve been on this more than anything else.	Jien ġejt dwar dan aktar minn kull ħaġa oħra.
Unless there’s something obviously wrong, of course.	Sakemm ma jkunx hemm xi ħaġa ovvjament ħażina, ovvjament.
Now it’s done.	Issa sar.
I make mine.	Jien nagħmel tiegħi.
Obviously you have to be.	Ovvjament trid tkun.
Nor was he here.	Hekk ukoll ma kienx hawn.
I want to be happy.	Irrid inkun kuntent.
Something that is not there.	Xi ħaġa li mhix hemm.
It was his first job.	Kien l-ewwel xogħol tiegħu.
Everyone knows this.	Kulħadd jaf dan.
She was doing it again.	Hija kienet qed tagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
I know it’s hard.	Naf li huwa diffiċli.
That's what you do.	Huwa dak li tagħmel.
Look at all of these.	Ħares lejn dawn kollha.
She wouldn’t be here much more.	Hija ma tkunx hawn ħafna aktar.
Your problem is still there.	Il-problema tiegħek għadha hemm.
His work was done.	Ix-xogħol tiegħu sar.
I was very glad.	Kont ferħan ħafna.
I always think so.	Dejjem naħseb hekk.
This is really, really bad.	Dan huwa tassew, tassew ħażin.
Or it won't be.	Jew mhux se jkun.
I made mine.	Jien għamilt tiegħi.
If no one is with you, speak alone.	Jekk ħadd ma jkun miegħek, titkellem waħdu.
And really.	U tassew.
I couldn’t go.	Ma stajtx immur.
I have no job.	M'għandix xogħol.
So it was done well.	Hekk sar tajjeb.
And he knew.	U kien jaf.
I will be done soon.	Dalwaqt se nkun għamilt.
But everything works fine.	Imma kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
It's small.	Huwa żgħir.
You never know that.	Inti qatt ma tkun taf li.
I knew it was going to be something big.	Kont naf li se tkun xi ħaġa kbira.
You don’t even want to.	Lanqas ma trid.
I can’t do this forever.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan għal dejjem.
She was out.	Kienet barra.
If not him, it would be someone else.	Jekk mhux hu, ikun xi ħadd ieħor.
He was like a man to me.	Huwa kien bħal raġel għalija.
He had tried everything.	Huwa kien ipprova kollox.
I need to be able to see.	Għandi bżonn inkun kapaċi nara.
he said.	hu qal.
We are.	Aħna aħna.
I wish it wasn’t so.	Nixtieq li ma kienx hekk.
I think it’s a good one.	Naħseb li hija waħda tajba.
Maybe all of them.	Forsi kollha kemm huma.
This can only be.	Dan jista 'jkun biss.
He died for you.	Miet għalik.
Maybe I saw someone else.	Forsi rajt lil xi ħadd ieħor.
It was out.	Kien barra.
Int.	Int .
But none of this was going to happen.	Imma xejn minn dan ma kien se jiġri.
I told the truth.	għidt il-verità.
You were here.	Int kont hawn.
Nothing went wrong.	Xejn mar ħażin.
It was great.	Kienet kbira.
Nothing like that had ever happened before.	Qatt ma kien jiġri xi ħaġa bħal dik qabel.
You can’t be a teacher anymore.	Ma tistax tkun għalliem aktar.
It's not good.	Mhuwiex tajjeb.
But that was great.	Imma dan kien kbir.
Well, we can’t do much about this one.	Ukoll, ma nistgħux nagħmlu ħafna dwar dan wieħed.
This is happening a lot.	Dan qed jiġri ħafna.
There was a need.	Kien hemm bżonn.
They were very much together.	Kienu flimkien ħafna.
Lots of work.	Ħafna xogħol.
Looks like they have it all.	Qisu għandhom dan kollu.
But you’re still young.	Imma int għadek żgħir.
It’s not the same one.	Mhuwiex l-istess wieħed.
This is just for us.	Dan huwa biss għalina.
It's everything.	Huwa kollox.
I don’t always know why.	Mhux dejjem naf għaliex.
I’ve seen this before !.	Rajt dan qabel!.
She never knew.	Qatt ma kienet tkun taf.
Tired, she was.	Għajjien, kienet.
No one can ever know about it.	Ħadd ma jista’ qatt ikun jaf dwar dan.
Nothing like today.	Xejn bħal illum.
You are the only one, the last one.	Int l-uniku wieħed, l-aħħar wieħed.
We need to know how.	Irridu nkunu nafu kif.
He was unemployed.	Kien bla xogħol.
It wasn’t that either.	Ma kienx dak lanqas.
And it was like any.	U kien bħal kull.
No one else will.	Ħadd ieħor se jagħmel.
No one talks to him, everyone goes back.	Ħadd ma jitkellem miegħu, kulħadd imur lura.
I just want to know.	Irrid inkun naf biss.
It was just so much work.	Kien biss tant xogħol.
I wish someone had a better way.	Nixtieq xi ħadd ikollu mod aħjar.
I can’t say enough about it.	Ma nistax ngħid biżżejjed dwarha.
I'm very surprised.	Jien sorpriż ħafna.
But it wasn’t, really.	Imma ma kienx, tassew.
He was very right.	Kellu raġun ħafna.
But this is not for us.	Imma dan mhux għalina.
It was there and I made it my friend.	Kien hemm u għamilt dan ħabib tiegħi.
They felt bad.	Ħassu ħażin.
Too much car.	Wisq karozza.
It will be much easier.	Se jkun ħafna aktar faċli.
There is no way around this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod madwar dan.
I think you know that.	Naħseb li taf li.
He is afraid of who and what he was.	Jibża’ min u x’kien.
There was someone he needed to see.	Kien hemm xi ħadd li kellu bżonn jara.
He doesn’t talk much about it.	Ma tantx jitkellem dwarha.
Something can happen.	Jista' jiġri xi ħaġa.
Nothing went together.	Xejn ma mar flimkien.
Well all week, actually.	Ukoll il-ġimgħa kollha, fil-fatt.
Everything will work.	Kollox se jaħdem.
I had some money.	Kelli xi flus.
But it was beautiful.	Imma kienet sabiħa.
I’ve done that.	Jien stajt għamilt hekk.
You want to know all this already.	Trid tkun taf dan kollu diġà.
But maybe he wasn’t doing it.	Imma forsi ma kienx jagħmel hekk.
And he can't.	U ma jistax.
In fact it may be about yet more than that.	Fil-fatt jista 'jkun dwar għadu aktar minn hekk.
He could see everything.	Seta’ jara kollox.
That would be great.	Dan ikun kbir.
He can, if he wants to.	Jista’, jekk irid.
I was here alone.	Jien kont hawn waħdi.
It was easy too.	Kien faċli wisq.
For many one is what we are.	Għal ħafna wieħed huwa dak li aħna.
It was here, that was all.	Kien hawn, dak kien kollu.
To do this we need everyone.	Biex nagħmlu dan għandna bżonn lil kulħadd.
They need help.	Għandhom bżonn l-għajnuna.
That’s all he does.	Dan huwa dak kollu li jagħmel.
He never did that.	Qatt ma għamel hekk.
Or it wasn’t.	Jew ma kienx.
Work was work.	Ix-xogħol kien xogħol.
I’m good actually.	Jien tajjeb fil-fatt.
I will not do so.	Jien mhux se nagħmel hekk.
Not for long.	Mhux għal żmien twil.
I don’t want to have to try again.	Ma rridx ikolli għalfejn nipprova mill-ġdid.
He looks better.	Huwa jidher aħjar.
And he agreed with me.	U hu qabel miegħi.
You’re still thinking small.	Int għadek taħseb żgħir.
Not really all that helpful.	Mhux verament dak kollu ta 'għajnuna.
I can't see anything.	Ma nistax nara xejn.
It's the only idea they have.	Hija l-unika idea li għandhom.
I had a good time, sure.	Kelli żmien tajjeb, żgur.
It makes something easier.	Jagħmel xi ħaġa aktar faċli.
They are my friends.	Huma ħbieb tiegħi.
You stand there, that's all.	Inti toqgħod hemm, dak kollox.
I've never heard of this.	Qatt ma smajt b’dan.
The same one.	L-istess waħda.
All right.	Kollox tajjeb.
That’s not something.	Dik mhix xi ħaġa.
I could see how it all happened.	Stajt nara kif ġara kollox.
And he could live with me.	U seta’ jgħix miegħi.
No, really we are not.	Le, tassew aħna le.
It was the first difficult year alone.	Kienet l-ewwel sena diffiċli waħdi.
It wasn’t bad.	Ma kienx ħażin.
Think about how they felt.	Jaħseb dwar kif ħassu.
What comes around goes.	Dak li jiġi madwar imur.
I think you can tell.	Naħseb li tista' tgħid.
But she says you are not.	Imma hi tgħid li m'intix.
He had no idea who anyone was.	Ma kellux idea min kien xi ħadd.
He was my first.	Huwa kien l-ewwel tiegħi.
That’s all he needed to know.	Dak hu kollu li kellu bżonn ikun jaf.
There was one thing.	Kien hemm ħaġa waħda.
Well, almost everything.	Ukoll, kważi kollox.
It’s always great.	Huwa dejjem kbir.
If not.	Jekk mhux.
And so fast.	U hekk malajr.
You can do it, but you definitely do it.	Tista 'tagħmel dan, imma żgur tagħmel dan.
I just thought you should know.	Biss ħsibt li għandek tkun taf.
It was easy.	Din kienet faċli.
It's late.	Huwa tard.
This is because it really works.	Dan għaliex verament jaħdem.
Maybe not tomorrow, but soon.	Forsi mhux għada, imma dalwaqt.
It was so bad for me.	Kien daqshekk ħażin għalija.
I wasn’t sure.	Ma kontx ċert.
You stay here with me.	Inti toqgħod hawn miegħi.
He knows what you need.	Jaf dak li għandek bżonn.
He did do.	Huwa għamel jagħmel.
I would know.	Inkun naf.
It was pretty big to see.	Kien pjuttost kbir biex tara.
It was a little too much.	Kien ftit wisq.
It was a beautiful morning.	Kienet filgħodu sabiħa.
As long as she was still talking to him after yesterday.	Sakemm kienet għadha titkellem miegħu wara lbieraħ.
All our work, ready.	Ix-xogħol tagħna kollu, lest.
I don’t have to do that.	M'għandix għalfejn nagħmel dan.
That works so well.	Li jaħdem daqshekk tajjeb.
Hard to tell really.	Diffiċli li tgħid verament.
The truth is not what was out there.	Il-verità mhix dak li kien hemm barra.
I’ll see that, too.	Jien se nara li dan, ukoll.
You can do this later.	Tista 'tagħmel dan aktar tard.
I thought about everything.	Ħsibt dwar kollox.
And now with you.	U issa miegħek.
Not a problem for him.	Mhux problema għalih.
Better not think about it.	Aħjar ma naħsibx dwarha.
I'm not coming.	Jien mhux ġej.
I believe you want to know.	Nemmen li trid tkun taf.
Or say no.	Jew għid le.
I can go, he thought.	Nista’ mmur, ħaseb.
Someone can say something.	Xi ħadd jista 'jgħid xi ħaġa.
That's not me.	Dak mhux jien.
I want to see.	Irrid nara.
He would be.	Huwa jkun.
You have to be ready for something.	Trid tkun lest għal xi ħaġa.
I shouldn’t be a little surprised.	M'għandix inkun xi ftit sorpriż.
Maybe he missed something.	Forsi tilef xi ħaġa.
Obviously, you are right.	Ovvjament, għandek raġun.
A man is not supposed to need much.	Raġel mhux suppost jeħtieġ ħafna.
I'm me.	Jien jien.
I hadn’t thought about it.	Ma kontx ħsibt dwar dan.
I just finished.	Għadni kif lest.
Maybe you want to talk about it.	Forsi tixtieq titkellem dwarha.
You will never be around.	Inti qatt ma tkun madwar.
It’s the only thing he does.	Hija l-unika ħaġa li jagħmel.
But not everyone thinks the same.	Imma mhux kulħadd jaħseb l-istess.
But it didn’t have to be that way.	Imma ma kellux ikun hekk.
It will help a lot.	Se jgħin ħafna.
He will have fun.	Hu ser jieħu gost.
One problem, I thought.	Problema waħda, ħsibt.
That's enough, you know.	Dak biżżejjed, taf.
He thought it best not to know.	Huwa ħaseb li jkun aħjar li ma jkunx jaf.
He is doing this almost properly.	Qed jagħmel dan kważi kif suppost.
But it’s a big deal.	Imma hija ħaġa kbira.
This has now happened.	Dan issa ġara.
You are definitely tired.	Int żgur għajjien.
As soon as possible.	Kemm jista' jkun malajr.
He said nothing wrong.	Ma qal xejn ħażin.
It's almost ready.	Huwa kważi lest.
This seems to work pretty well.	Dan jidher li jaħdem pjuttost tajjeb.
It didn’t fit.	Ma kellux tajjeb.
I just try not to think about it anymore.	Nipprova biss ma naħsibx aktar dwarha.
But no one expects that to happen.	Imma ħadd ma jistenna li jiġri hekk.
That time never comes back.	Dak iż-żmien qatt ma jiġi lura.
I’ll be late for that, but whatever.	Jien ser inkun tard għal dak, imma tkun xi tkun.
He looked around.	Huwa ħares lejn madwar.
I think he can do that.	Naħseb li jista 'jagħmel dan.
Not so much with me.	Mhux daqshekk miegħi.
Maybe he was afraid to know.	Forsi kien jibża jkun jaf.
But of course, you never can.	Imma ovvjament, qatt ma tista’.
In fact, there is more to it.	Fil-fatt, hemm aktar minn hekk.
I know I love it.	Naf inħobb.
Way before, actually.	Mod qabel, fil-fatt.
There was no one else around that time.	Ma kien hemm ħadd ieħor madwar dak iż-żmien.
This is one way to do it.	Dan huwa mod wieħed biex isir dan.
I can’t wait for that to happen.	Ma nistax nistenna li jiġri hekk.
There were only a few problems.	Kien hemm biss ftit problemi.
It's maybe not bad.	Huwa forsi mhux ħażin.
Nobody does.	Ħadd ma jagħmel.
At that time he was ready.	Dak iż-żmien kien lest.
He did, not me.	Huwa għamel, mhux jien.
It was never over.	Qatt ma kien aktar.
I'm with some people there.	Jien ma’ xi nies hemmhekk.
It’s harder than you think.	Huwa aktar diffiċli milli suppost suppost.
I’m still not on that.	Għadni mhux fuq dak.
He could have.	Huwa seta 'jkollu.
It would be again.	Ikun mill-ġdid.
He had seen one before.	Huwa kien ra waħda qabel.
He wanted to do something.	Ried jagħmel xi ħaġa.
I wanted to try again.	Ridt nerġa' nipprova.
This will be good for us.	Dan se jkun tajjeb għalina.
She was good, too.	Hija kienet tajba, ukoll.
It doesn't have to be that way.	M'għandux ikun hekk.
Not for everyone.	Mhux għal kulħadd.
I wanted something easy and jobless.	Ridt xi ħaġa faċli u bla xogħol.
I hope you do to.	Nispera li tagħmel biex.
I understand that more than anyone.	Nifhem li aktar minn ħadd.
It can be.	Hija tista 'tkun.
I needed to get out of there quickly.	Kelli bżonn barra minn hemm malajr.
But this was not the time.	Imma dan ma kienx iż-żmien.
.	.
He wasn’t ready to wait.	Ma kienx lest jistenna.
He wanted to say something else.	Ried jgħid xi ħaġa oħra.
I don't think so.	Ma naħsibx li jista’ jkun hemm daqshekk.
I would like to do that.	Nixtieq li jagħmlu dan.
I would be good for you.	Inkun tajjeb għalik.
Everything that comes before is here.	Dak kollu li jiġi qabel qiegħed hawn.
No one told me they were there.	Ħadd ma qalli li kienu hemm.
You have one child there.	Għandek tifel wieħed hemmhekk.
And maybe she knew it.	U forsi kienet taf dan.
Very good, actually.	Tajjeb ħafna, fil-fatt.
And everything.	U kollox.
This was driving.	Dan kien qed isuq.
Well, we will.	Ukoll, aħna se.
But he seems worried.	Imma jidher inkwetat.
He was playing with me.	Kien qed jilgħab miegħi.
I listen all the time.	Nisma’ dak il-ħin kollu.
It was out.	Kien barra.
And he seems to have done.	U jidher li għamel.
No one was out.	Ħadd ma kien barra.
But it was him.	Imma kien hu.
Now he is back.	Issa huwa lura.
But it won’t be great.	Imma mhux se jkun kbir.
But we are.	Imma aħna.
It's not that long.	Mhuwiex daqshekk twil.
It happens to us when he needs it.	Jiġri magħna meta jkollu bżonn.
In fact not.	Fil-fatt le.
He loved it.	Huwa iħobb dan.
You don’t have to do too many things.	M'għandekx għalfejn tagħmel wisq affarijiet.
Everyone has problems.	Kulħadd għandu problemi.
Not everyone will be able to do that.	Mhux kulħadd ikun jista’ jagħmel dan.
Or it could be anything he says.	Jew kollox jista’ jkun kif jgħid hu.
It was no problem.	Ma kienet l-ebda problema.
My friends.	Ħbieb tiegħi.
We are both so.	Aħna t-tnejn hekk.
I hope you are well and happy.	Nittama li int tajjeb u kuntent.
I’m probably thinking too much about it.	Probabbilment qed naħseb wisq dwarha.
It's really me.	Huwa tassew jien.
But it was more than that.	Imma kien aktar minn hekk.
Not as long as you stay there.	Mhux sakemm toqgħod hemm.
Everything works very well.	Kollox jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
He left early and went back home late, if anything.	Telaq kmieni u mar lura d-dar tard, jekk xejn.
And it doesn’t have to be for long.	U m'għandux għalfejn ikun għal żmien twil.
It can be difficult to.	Jista 'jkun diffiċli li.
I didn’t have that problem.	Ma kellix dik il-problema.
Another way as follows.	Mod ieħor kif ġej.
I’ve been able to do that.	Jien stajt nagħmel hekk.
Only one person.	Persuna waħda biss.
It was always there.	Dejjem kien hemm.
He should be here soon.	Huwa għandu jkun hawn dalwaqt.
He told me it was.	Huwa qalli li kien.
I couldn’t say for sure.	Ma setax ngħid żgur.
I’m thinking about it.	Qed naħseb dwarha.
I am very sorry for this.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna għal dan.
I'm everything ready.	Jien kollox lest.
They are about the same.	Huma madwar l-istess.
To do things for other people.	Biex tagħmel affarijiet għal nies oħra.
He knows that’s it.	Jaf li hu dak.
Currently ,.	Bħalissa,.
This car looks great.	Din il-karozza tidher ħafna.
I want to know what happened and why.	Irrid inkun naf x'ġara u għaliex.
I wish he had.	Nixtieq li kellu.
But there was a problem with that.	Imma kien hemm problema b'dan.
It was still quite early.	Kien għadu pjuttost kmieni.
In fact, everything is so good.	Fil-fatt, kollox huwa hekk tajjeb.
They are for everyone.	Huma għal kulħadd.
I was happy to see this.	Kont kuntent li nara dan.
Everything became easy.	Kollox sar faċli.
All that was coming.	Dak kollu li kien ġej.
Until then they were.	Sa dak iż-żmien kienu.
Just a big man like that.	Biss raġel kbir bħal dak.
Come back.	Tiġi lura.
Here's what you need to know.	Hawn dak li għandek tkun taf.
And before that.	U dak ta’ qabel dak.
He is a big boy.	Huwa tifel kbir.
And nothing you can do about it.	U xejn li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
There was so much.	Kien hemm tant.
It’s just a matter of time.	Hija biss ħaġa ta' ħin.
I have someone.	Għandi xi ħadd.
But this is still nothing.	Imma dan għadu xejn.
As we knew.	Kif konna nafu.
I always did.	Jien dejjem għamilt.
You know, this is a big problem.	Taf, din hija problema kbira.
Well, of course, it wasn’t.	Ukoll, ovvjament, ma kienx.
But now is not the time.	Imma issa mhux iż-żmien.
He knows it’s wrong.	Jaf li huwa ħażin.
I used to eat there many years ago.	Kont niekol hemm ħafna snin ilu.
For me that was something great to see.	Għalija dik kienet xi ħaġa kbira li nara.
He felt like he needed to sit down.	Ħassu qisu kellu bżonn joqgħod bilqiegħda.
He needed to eat something.	Kellu bżonn jiekol xi ħaġa.
Both would.	It-tnejn kieku.
She knew it would.	Kienet taf li kieku.
It can be difficult for him.	Jista 'jkun diffiċli għalih.
But I never saw anyone there.	Imma qatt ma rajt lil ħadd hemmhekk.
Let’s do this once and for all.	Ejja nagħmlu dan darba għal dejjem.
I’m trying to understand.	Qed nipprova nifhem.
I wonder where he is now.	Nistaqsi fejn qiegħed issa.
This is where you will stand.	Dan huwa fejn inti se toqgħod.
Ask how many people we have here now.	Staqsa kemm għandna nies hawn issa.
He knows nothing about it.	Ma jaf xejn dwarha.
But there is one thing you cannot do.	Imma hemm ħaġa waħda li ma tistax tagħmel.
It's probably already ready.	Huwa probabbilment diġà lest.
One can count a little.	Wieħed jista 'joqgħod ftit.
So far of course.	Sa issa ovvjament.
Le u le.	Le u le.
I hear he died.	Nisma li miet.
It couldn’t be much.	Ma setax ikun ħafna.
You can make it easier for me, or harder.	Tista 'tagħmel dan aktar faċli għalija, jew aktar diffiċli.
We did well.	Għamilna tajjeb.
He sat down, he had to think.	Poġġa bilqiegħda, kellu jaħseb.
His never had.	Tiegħu qatt ma kellu.
This was always going to happen.	Dan dejjem kien se jiġri.
And it doesn’t work that way.	U mhux hekk jaħdem.
He did little.	Ma tantx għamel xejn.
Look at what he did.	Ħares lejn dak li għamel.
We will definitely be back again.	Żgur li se nkunu lura mill-ġdid.
I'm so happy.	Jien tant kuntent.
No, it's one.	Le, hija waħda.
He’s not doing a hard job well.	Mhux qed jagħmel xogħol diffiċli tajjeb.
You have to be good.	Int għandek tkun tajjeb.
It is either or.	Huwa jew jew.
I never had.	Qatt ma kelli.
Money was needed.	Kien hemm bżonn ta’ flus.
I didn’t want this for you.	Ma ridtx dan għalik.
Who knew he had one.	Min kien jaf li kellu wieħed.
And there it was.	U hemm kien.
He was not here.	Ma kienx hawn.
Mary was right.	Marija kellha raġun.
If you don’t, that’s not the truth.	Jekk ma tagħmilx hekk, dik mhix il-verità.
I was only small.	Kont żgħir biss.
He didn’t tell me anything like that.	Ma qalli xejn bħal dan.
You can stay there tonight.	Tista' toqgħod hemm illejla.
I did with him.	Għamilt miegħu.
It's so not just you.	Huwa hekk mhux biss int.
I have something to tell you.	Għandi xi ħaġa xi ngħidlek.
Another way to know.	Mod ieħor biex tkun taf.
You see nothing.	Ma tara xejn.
And he wanted to.	U ried.
After all.	Wara kollox .
Lots and lots of friends.	Ħafna u ħafna ħbieb.
Good when good.	Tajjeb meta jkun tajjeb.
Now it was the same.	Issa kienet l-istess.
It doesn’t seem to have been there.	Ma jidhirx li kien hemm.
It should have, of course.	Għandu jkollu, ovvjament.
After all, there was.	Wara kollox, kien hemm.
That's what happened today.	Hekk ġara llum.
To speak, nothing more.	Biex titkellem, xejn aktar.
This is what will happen.	Dan huwa dak li se jiġri.
I’m not even sure who is who.	Jien lanqas ċert min hu min.
And it really does.	U verament jagħmel.
You don’t take any of that.	Inti ma tieħu xejn minn dak.
But if she did, it would be too late.	Imma kieku kienet tagħmel, kienet tkun tard.
Look at it like this.	Ħares lejn bħal dan.
I wanted to be a teacher.	Ridt inkun għalliem.
Now, she would.	Issa, hi kieku.
I don’t even talk about it.	Lanqas nitkellem dwarha.
And what it is not.	U dak li mhuwiex.
And maybe not a year.	U forsi mhux sena.
who knows.	min jaf.
He had nowhere to go here.	Ma kellu fejn imur hawn.
I have never seen anything like it.	Qatt ma rajt xi ħaġa bħal din.
Nor will it be the last.	Lanqas ma jkun l-aħħar.
No one is there who wants to be there.	Ħadd ma hemm li jrid ikun hemm.
She has a son.	Għandu tifel.
But that won’t help now.	Imma dan mhux se jgħin issa.
I had no money, of course.	Jien ma kellix flus, ovvjament.
I think everything works well.	Naħseb li kollox jaħdem tajjeb.
I’m glad it’s your job, not mine.	Jien ferħan li huwa xogħol tiegħek, mhux tiegħi.
We need to know how and why and where.	Irridu nkunu nafu kif u għaliex u fejn.
And we did.	U għamilna.
He doesn't have time for that.	M’għandux ħin għal dan.
You can talk about this a little more.	Tista 'titkellem dwar dan ftit aktar.
I can do that too.	Jien nista' nagħmel dan ukoll.
No one came to help.	Ħadd ma ġie jgħin.
And he told me.	U qalli.
Such a beautiful person.	Persuna tant sabiħa.
Not now.	Mhux issa.
They were doing nothing.	Huma ma kienu jagħmlu xejn.
They weren’t always the same thing.	Huma mhux dejjem kienu l-istess ħaġa.
And no, it's not.	U le, mhuwiex.
You did a lot of work.	Int għamilt ħafna xogħol.
You are not taking.	M'intix qed tieħu.
He lost his job.	Huwa tilef ix-xogħol tiegħu.
She just needed more time.	Hija biss kellha bżonn aktar ħin.
And a really good man.	U raġel tassew tajjeb.
And you should be, too.	U għandek tiġi, ukoll.
He wanted otherwise.	Ried mod ieħor.
It seems to be working better now.	Jidher li qed jaħdem aħjar issa.
I needed to be alone.	Kelli bżonn inkun waħdi.
There are a few.	Hemm ftit.
Maybe he's right.	Forsi għandu raġun.
Or a good one with me.	Jew wieħed tajjeb miegħi.
This is exactly how it should be.	Dan huwa eżatt kif għandu jkun.
This was not likely to happen.	Dan ma kienx probabbli li jiġri.
I have been there for many.	Kont hemm għal ħafna.
I died outside.	Mort barra.
But they are us and we are.	Imma huma aħna u aħna huma.
It only takes a while.	Huwa biss jieħu ftit żmien.
You must want to do this.	Trid trid tagħmel dan.
You're still me.	Għadek lili.
That was time.	Li kien żmien.
There is nothing you can do.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel.
This will do it.	Dan se jagħmel dan.
Well, that was easy.	Ukoll, dan kien faċli.
They really were pretty good.	Huma verament kienu pjuttost tajba.
Maybe they are both.	Forsi huma t-tnejn.
I have been alone so much.	Ilni waħdi tant.
But that was before it all happened.	Imma dan kien qabel ma ġara dan kollu.
It was doing too much now.	Kien qed isir wisq issa.
And he’s thinking fast.	U qed jaħseb malajr.
And you want to do it fast.	U trid tagħmel dan malajr.
Everyone is doing the work.	Kulħadd qed jagħmel ix-xogħol.
That was good for me.	Dak kien tajjeb minni.
There is nothing wrong with being happy.	M'hemm xejn ħażin li tkun kuntent.
I can't understand this.	Jien ma nistax nifhem dan.
Definitely say so.	Żgur ngħid hekk.
You already know this.	Inti diġà taf dan.
It probably needs to be great.	Probabbilment jeħtieġ li jkun kbir.
I came back.	Ġejt lura.
She seems to be a very beautiful person.	Hija tidher li hija persuna sabiħa ħafna.
This looks good.	Dan jidher tajjeb.
But it’s time.	Imma wasal żmien.
I believe it should be there.	Nemmen li għandu jkun hemm.
Not eating much.	Mhux tiekol ħafna.
And it was hard.	U kien diffiċli.
Which is small.	Li huwa żgħir.
I love these two together.	Inħobb lil dawn it-tnejn flimkien.
He never even knew.	Lanqas qatt ma kien jaf.
Sorry, really.	Jiddispjaċini, tassew.
What is going to happen will happen soon.	Dak li jkun se jiġri se jiġri dalwaqt.
I don’t think I do that.	Jien ma naħseb li nagħmel hekk.
But there were also problems.	Imma kien hemm ukoll problemi.
I understand that this will not work for us.	Nifhem li dan mhux se jaħdem għalina.
You know we can.	Taf li nistgħu.
It's evening.	Huwa filgħaxija.
In fact it almost happened.	Fil-fatt li kważi ġara.
It’s not bad, really.	Mhuwiex ħażin, tassew.
It’s always the same thing again.	Huwa dejjem l-istess ħaġa mill-ġdid.
That he could do.	Li seta’ jagħmel.
But no one said it was so.	Imma ħadd ma qal li kien hekk.
It's too big.	Huwa kbir wisq.
She wasn’t going there.	Ma kinitx tmur hemm.
Next week, or earlier.	Il-ġimgħa d-dieħla, jew qabel.
But he was going to do something nice for him.	Imma kien se jagħmel xi ħaġa sabiħa għalih.
But there was no one.	Imma ma kien hemm ħadd.
Happy, but surprised.	Kuntent, imma sorpriż.
I would.	Nixtieq.
This is about everything.	Dan huwa dwar kollox.
She did a great job.	Hija għamlet xogħol kbir.
I'm still not sure.	Għadni mhux ċert.
But that now has to wait.	Imma dak issa jkollu jistenna.
You can't do that.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan.
Maybe it always has been.	Forsi dejjem kien.
Everything had to go great.	Kollox kellu jmur kbir.
Maybe the two together.	Forsi t-tnejn flimkien.
Why did it take so long.	Għaliex ħa daqshekk twil.
I don’t know how this happened.	Ma nafx kif ġara dan.
He could not leave.	Ma setax telaq.
He felt so bad.	Huwa ħassu daqshekk ħażin.
But this is good too.	Imma dan huwa tajjeb ukoll.
Something will go wrong.	Xi ħaġa se tmur ħażin.
It was just really long.	Kien biss verament twil.
But almost no one left.	Imma kważi telaq ħadd.
I did it once.	Għamilt darba.
That did nothing.	Dak ma għamel xejn.
There were too many.	Kien hemm wisq.
And we were friends.	U konna ħbieb.
That’s not all.	Dak mhux kollox.
No one was there.	Ħadd ma kien hemm.
Which will probably help.	Li probabbilment ikun ta’ għajnuna.
There was no need to be.	Ma kienx hemm għalfejn kien.
No one knew who she was.	Ħadd ma kien jaf min kienet.
I see, now.	Nara, issa.
The same.	L-istess.
He loved the book.	Huwa kien iħobb il-ktieb.
It has always been so.	Dejjem kien hekk.
But it looks like you know something.	Imma qisu taf xi ħaġa.
Nothing will ever be ready.	Xejn qatt mhu se jkun lest.
I couldn’t do that.	Ma stajtx nagħmel hekk.
This is often what you want.	Dan huwa spiss dak li trid.
It was the same person.	Kien l-istess persuna.
I’m sure there’s something.	Jien ċert li hemm xi ħaġa.
He takes what he wants.	Huwa jieħu dak li jrid.
I had never done this before.	Qatt ma kelli nagħmel dan qabel.
It really is what it is.	Huwa tassew dak li hu.
I’m so out of here.	Jien hekk barra minn hawn.
I know too.	Naf ukoll.
Nothing good can come of this.	Xejn tajjeb ma jista 'jiġi minn dan.
And there was something else.	U kien hemm ħaġa oħra.
It's better that way.	Huwa aħjar hekk.
And never talk about it.	U qatt ma titkellem dwarha.
I’m going to let you know you’re here.	Immur nagħmel jaf li qiegħed hawn.
Try this a few times.	Ipprova dan ftit drabi.
I was doing my best to go home.	Kont nagħmel minn kollox biex immur id-dar.
This is not always easy to do.	Dan mhux dejjem faċli li tagħmel.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
I do what we can.	Jien nagħmel li nistgħu.
I knew it would be the same with me.	Kont naf li se jkun l-istess miegħi.
I’m not interested in anything.	Jien mhu interessat xejn.
She was not home.	Hija ma kinitx id-dar.
You went there alone.	Inti mort hemm waħdek.
It was a little help.	Kienet ftit għajnuna.
It doesn’t look difficult.	Mhux qisu diffiċli.
She says nothing.	Hija ma tgħid xejn.
That was all too much.	Dan kien kollu wisq.
Nothing like this has ever happened here.	Xejn bħal dan qatt ma ġara hawn.
You will be with me at this job.	Int se tkun miegħi fuq dan ix-xogħol.
But the first is difficult.	Imma l-ewwel huwa diffiċli.
And it is a thing.	U hija ħaġa.
Very well, he would have had to go.	Tajjeb ħafna, kien ikollu jmur.
I was very scared.	Kont nibża’ ħafna.
It’s something worth knowing.	Hija xi ħaġa ta 'min tkun taf.
And we are friends and everything.	U aħna ħbieb u kollox.
I’m willing to believe it.	Jien lest li nemmen.
This should not be done.	Dan m'għandux isir.
There was a chance, supposedly.	Kien hemm ċans, suppost.
It was there today.	Kien hemm illum.
It was a good year.	Kienet sena tajba.
So much was happening.	Tant kien qed jiġri.
So it always has been.	Hekk dejjem kien.
Someone died here a few years ago.	Xi ħadd miet hawn ftit snin ilu.
She needed none.	Ma kellha bżonn l-ebda.
It was nothing for him.	Ma kien xejn għalih.
Not so much tonight.	Mhux daqshekk illejla.
I want to talk to him.	Irrid nitkellem miegħu.
Sometimes this is easy, and sometimes not.	Xi drabi dan huwa faċli, u xi drabi mhux.
It wasn’t good.	Ma kienx tajjeb.
I had to know this.	I kellha naf dan.
I've never heard of this before.	Qatt ma smajt b’dan qabel.
Not great, that one.	Mhux kbir, dak wieħed.
Faster, she says.	Aktar malajr, tgħid.
Or do it another time.	Jew tagħmel dan ħin ieħor.
Neither do you.	U lanqas int.
I was wondering about this all the time.	Kont nistaqsi dwar dan il-ħin kollu.
He's probably staying back there.	Huwa probabbilment jibqa 'lura hemm.
It's all over.	Huwa kollu fuq.
But this was not going to happen.	Imma dan ma kienx se jiġri.
And so are yours.	U hekk huma tiegħek.
Like he didn’t want to say.	Bħal ma riedx jgħid.
Everyone was too tired to happen.	Kulħadd kien għajjien wisq biex jiġri.
There would be another.	Ikun hemm ieħor.
He is a man.	Huwa raġel.
He will definitely not buy again.	Żgur li mhux se jerġa' jixtri.
I was thinking about it.	Jien kont qed naħseb dwarha.
You are not home so early very often.	M'intix id-dar hekk kmieni ħafna drabi.
Not very often.	Mhux ħafna drabi.
I want to try this.	Irrid nipprova dan.
I knew what they were going to do to me.	Kont naf x’se jagħmlu miegħi.
Not a big problem, no.	Mhux problema kbira, le.
There is nothing to it.	M'hemm xejn li.
No, apparently nothing had gone wrong.	Le, milli jidher xejn ma kien mar ħażin.
That one never says, he thought.	Li wieħed qatt ma jgħid, ħaseb.
It won’t take long.	Mhux se jieħu ħafna.
There is no problem with that.	M'hemm l-ebda problema b'dan.
It is working properly.	Qed jaħdem kif suppost.
She is really beautiful.	Hija tassew sabiħa.
He hasn't seen anything yet.	Għadu ma ra xejn.
It’s too good for something like this.	Hija tajba wisq għal xi ħaġa bħal din.
Soon it will.	Dalwaqt se.
It's almost evening.	Huwa kważi filgħaxija.
He can do anything you can think of.	Huwa jista 'jagħmel kull ħaġa li tista' taħseb.
It was after.	Kien wara.
This really is.	Dan huwa verament.
We know who will always win.	Nafu min dejjem se jirbaħ.
More than most people.	Aktar minn ħafna nies.
He can’t work with him, either.	Hu ma jistax jaħdem miegħu, lanqas.
All this we can do.	Dan kollu nistgħu nagħmlu.
Enough, if he does.	Biżżejjed, jekk jagħmel hekk.
But it takes a long time.	Imma jieħu ħafna żmien.
But so it seemed to me.	Imma hekk deher għalija.
He was still ready to be friends.	Kien għadu lest li jkun ħbieb.
But that was three years ago.	Imma dan kien tliet snin ilu.
You are no better.	M'intix aħjar.
It was coming too fast for me, really.	Kien ġej malajr wisq għalija, tassew.
We already knew each other.	Diġà konna nafu lil xulxin.
That was so hard.	Dak kien tant diffiċli.
All right.	Kollox tajjeb.
.	.
It’s really, really hard.	Huwa verament, verament diffiċli.
I couldn’t tell you before.	Ma stajtx ngħidlek qabel.
I'm ready to go.	Jien lest li mmur.
This was obviously wrong.	Dan kien ovvjament ħażin.
It was a great thing.	Kienet xi ħaġa kbira.
Such things were.	Affarijiet bħal dawn kienu.
It’s a job, like any other job.	Huwa xogħol, bħal kull xogħol ieħor.
I believe you already know this.	Nemmen li diġà taf dan.
No one knew better.	Ħadd ma kien jaf aħjar.
You just want to see what's great about it.	Inti biss trid tara x'hemm kbir dwar dan.
Well, there it was.	Ukoll, kien hemm dan.
All alone.	Kollha waħdu.
I would go so far now.	Nixtieq immur issa tant.
I was scared for you.	Kont nibża għalik.
It was all just too much.	Dan kollu kien biss wisq.
You can’t go wrong with this.	Ma tistax tmur ħażin b'dan.
He has no friends either.	Lanqas m’għandux ħbieb.
If something happened, it had to be wrong.	Jekk jiġri xi ħaġa, kellha tkun ħażina.
That was the last thing.	Din kienet l-aħħar ħaġa.
And there was money.	U kien hemm flus.
I'm not ready.	Jien mhux lest.
It’s just a car, but it’s a beautiful car.	Hija biss karozza, imma hija karozza sabiħa.
You have something.	Għandek xi ħaġa.
It was wrong.	Kien ħażin.
You can’t do this alone.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan waħdek.
I’ll get back to that later.	Ser nerġa 'lura għal dan aktar tard.
It seemed almost exactly as it was yesterday.	Deher kważi eżatt kif kienet ilbieraħ.
It always seems so.	Hija dejjem tidher hekk.
But this was not so.	Imma dan ma kienx hekk.
But he had done it.	Imma kien għamel dan.
But really everything.	Imma verament kollox.
No, no, you shouldn’t be.	Le, le, m'għandekx tkun.
Or maybe be more willing to talk.	Jew forsi jkun aktar lest li jitkellem.
It got too big.	Sar kbir wisq.
He went back.	Huwa mar lura.
He can only be a very bad person.	Jista’ jkun biss persuna ħażina ħafna.
I'm sure she'll know how to do it.	Jien ċert li hi se tkun taf kif tagħmel dan.
Not so.	Mhux hekk.
More than a year.	Aktar minn sena.
She tells the truth.	Hi tgħid il-verità.
Sometimes this happens.	Xi drabi dan jiġri.
Maybe it won’t come to that.	Forsi mhux se jasal għal dan.
She was right, and he knew it.	Hija kellha raġun, u hu kien jaf.
I always knew you.	Dejjem kont naf li inti.
And maybe she was right.	U forsi kellha raġun.
And that was the only time when.	U dik kienet l-unika darba meta .
I go further.	Immur aktar.
This should not be the case.	Dan m'għandux ikun hekk.
This must have happened.	Dan żgur kien ġara.
Tomorrow, for sure.	Għada, żgur.
There and there.	Hemm u hemm.
I was not afraid.	Ma kontx nibża’.
Well, so was mine.	Ukoll, hekk kien tiegħi.
No one had done so before.	Ħadd ma kien għamel hekk qabel.
I could hear it well.	Stajt nisma’ tajjeb.
He could do whatever he wanted me to do just then.	Huwa seta 'jagħmel dak kollu li ried lili eżatt dak iż-żmien.
You already know.	Inti diġà taf.
But they are just so.	Imma huma biss hekk.
I just thought you should know this.	Ħsibt biss li għandek tkun taf dan.
It was coming.	Kien ġej.
And this is not a bad thing.	U din mhix xi ħaġa ħażina.
He didn't.	Huwa ma.
Nothing more was said about it.	Xejn aktar qal dwar dan.
I hope you make friends there.	Nispera li tagħmel ħbieb hemmhekk.
Maybe there is where she is.	Forsi hemm fejn hi.
But you're good.	Imma int tajjeb.
I can do things very, very fast.	Kapaċi nagħmel affarijiet malajr ħafna, ħafna.
But first he had done a very good job.	Imma l-ewwel kien għamel ħafna xogħol tajjeb.
I'm ready.	Jien lest.
If this goes, so can anything.	Jekk dan imur, hekk jista 'kollox.
There had to be a way for this to work.	Kellu jkun hemm mod kif dan jaħdem.
And there I am.	U hemm jien.
I did nothing.	Jien ma għamilt xejn.
This happens more and more.	Dan jiġri aktar u aktar.
And so on and so forth.	U hekk u fuq.
I’m not sure for how long.	M'inix ċert għal kemm żmien.
That's pretty great though.	Dik hija pjuttost kbira jekk.
That was all about it.	Dak kien kollu dwar dan.
It is now.	Huwa issa.
But he knows.	Imma jaf.
You want to see someone.	Trid tara lil xi ħadd.
That passed.	Dak għadda.
But it would be wrong.	Imma jkun ħażin.
More alone than ever.	Aktar waħedha milli qatt kienet.
But something bad must happen.	Imma għandu jiġri xi ħaġa ħażina.
And no more.	U mhux aktar.
I love mine.	Jien inħobb tiegħi.
Not a big deal to say.	Mhux ħaġa kbira tgħid.
There is one.	Hemm wieħed.
It’s time to talk.	Wasal iż-żmien li titkellem.
And everyone was glad.	U kulħadd kien ferħan.
Just a little.	Biss ftit.
He was talking.	Kien jitkellem.
It seemed blah.	Deher bla.
And after each, there is always another.	U wara kull wieħed, dejjem hemm ieħor.
Be back later !.	Tkun lura aktar tard!.
Very glad indeed.	Ferħan ħafna tassew.
He will be here right now.	Hu ser ikun hawn bħalissa.
It was about so much more than that.	Kien dwar ħafna aktar minn hekk.
All this in addition to the above.	Dan kollu flimkien ma 'hawn fuq.
I will have to do the same for him some time.	Ikolli nagħmel l-istess għalih xi żmien.
You have to do a lot of things.	Int għandek tagħmel ħafna affarijiet.
But so it must be.	Imma hekk għandu jkun.
It always gets better.	Jibqa' dejjem aħjar.
Sure, that’s an easy one.	Żgur, dik hija waħda faċli.
He was better than me, much better than me.	Kien aħjar minni, ħafna aħjar minni.
So do it.	Hekk tagħmel dan.
Apparently it is very small.	Milli jidher huwa żgħir ħafna.
It just looked great.	Huwa ħares biss kbir.
I come from that and he comes from that.	Jien ġej minn hekk u hu ġej minn hekk.
I am happy with this work.	Jien kuntent b'dan ix-xogħol.
Usually often.	Normalment ħafna drabi.
Don't be late.	Tkunx tard.
But she was not.	Imma hi ma kinitx.
But you can.	Imma tista'.
It just goes.	Imur biss.
There is just more money around.	Hemm biss aktar flus madwar.
But it wasn’t him.	Imma ma kienx hu.
I’m also interested in why.	Jien interessat ukoll għaliex.
It's better.	Huwa aħjar.
Just try not to want to go.	Ipprova biss ma tridx tmur.
She knew.	Kienet taf.
It’s either me or you.	Huwa jew jien jew int.
But something happened.	Imma ġara xi ħaġa.
As soon as you can.	Hekk kif tista'.
But maybe it wasn’t.	Imma forsi ma kienx.
I knew there would be.	Kont naf li se jkun hemm.
It's almost unnecessary.	Huwa kważi bla bżonn.
He can't do it anymore.	Ma jistax jagħmel dan aktar.
Well, there you go.	Ukoll, hemm tmur.
He knew.	Kien jaf.
And they have it.	U għandhom dan.
And he would know.	U kien ikun jaf.
I need friends.	Għandi bżonn ħbieb.
I wish it shouldn’t be so.	Nixtieq li ma kellux ikun hekk.
That's all they do.	Huwa dak kollu li jagħmlu.
And for once, we did.	U għal darba, għamilna.
We can make some money together.	Nistgħu nagħmlu ftit flus flimkien.
I think maybe that’s a problem.	Naħseb li forsi dik hija problema.
I don’t think you can stand it for long.	Ma naħsibx li tista' toqgħod għal żmien twil.
No one else can do that.	Ħadd ieħor ma jista 'jagħmel dan.
I was on it.	Jien kont fuq dan.
It will soon be evening.	Dalwaqt tkun filgħaxija.
Well, not unless you already know someone.	Ukoll, mhux sakemm ma tkunx diġà taf lil xi ħadd.
He could leave whenever he wanted.	Seta’ jitlaq meta jrid.
Nothing good comes easy.	Xejn tajjeb ma jiġi faċli.
That’s not the same thing.	Dik mhix l-istess ħaġa.
He is who you are.	Huwa min int.
I'm sure it will be fine.	Jien ċert li se jkun tajjeb.
It gets better.	Jiġi aħjar.
Back to one.	Lura għal wieħed.
Not when this happens.	Mhux meta jiġri dan.
But this is not so bad.	Imma din mhix daqshekk ħażina.
I just want what is mine.	Irrid biss dak li hu tiegħi.
You are so tired.	Inti tant għajjien.
They were almost home.	Kienu kważi d-dar.
If you need help, say so.	Jekk għandek bżonn għajnuna, għid hekk.
This will not happen.	Dan mhux se jiġri.
As always.	Kif dejjem hu.
Eating time.	Ħin tiekol.
It's coming on now.	Huwa ġej fuq issa.
Maybe it won’t be so bad.	Forsi mhux se jkun daqshekk ħażin.
Good thing that’s not really happening.	Ħaġa tajba li mhux qed jiġri verament.
I went there once.	Mort hemm darba.
I have to be good.	Għandi nkun tajjeb.
It is a lot.	Hija ħafna.
She knew he was right.	Kienet taf li kellu raġun.
Not me, me, just me.	Mhux jien, jien, jien biss.
I shouldn’t have been able to do that.	Ma kellix inkun kapaċi nagħmel dan.
He did it.	Huwa għamel dan.
I'm glad to hear that.	Jien ferħan li nisma' dan.
It can be so good.	Jista 'jkun hekk tajjeb.
I’m sure everything will work on its own.	Jien ċert li kollox se jaħdem waħdu.
It may or may not be.	Jista’ jkun, mhux se jkun.
But neither were they.	Imma lanqas ma kienu.
Look at all these things you do.	Ħares lejn dawn l-affarijiet kollha li tagħmel.
I was small.	Kont żgħir.
But it has to be good.	Imma jrid ikun tajjeb.
And it doesn’t.	U ma jagħmilx hekk.
You want to know how to do it.	Trid tkun taf kif tagħmel dan.
I was alone.	Jien kont waħdi.
This doesn’t look too bad.	Dan ma jidhirx ħażin wisq.
It started a lot.	Beda ħafna.
For me, it was great.	Għalija, kien tajjeb ħafna.
Many are around.	Ħafna huma madwar.
What happened is.	Dak li ġara hu.
Or it works.	Jew jaħdem.
He has to go.	Huwa għandu jmur.
I wasn’t at that time.	Ma kontx dak iż-żmien.
But whatever it is, it will be fast.	Imma tkun xi tkun, se tkun malajr.
I'm about finished in.	Jien dwar lest fi.
It's not that hard.	Mhuwiex daqshekk diffiċli.
Nobody knows exactly what happened next.	Ħadd ma jaf eżatt x’ġara wara.
He doesn't want to be friends with everyone.	Ma jridx ikun ħbieb ma’ kulħadd.
And this is a problem.	U din hija problema.
When he did.	Meta għamel.
Maybe you already know where she is.	Forsi diġà taf fejn hi.
Almost like friends.	Kważi bħal ħbieb.
There is always home.	Dejjem hemm id-dar.
But now she knew why.	Imma issa kienet taf għaliex.
Not work.	Mhux xogħol.
You were thinking.	Int kont taħseb.
In fact, you are not.	Fil-fatt, m'intix.
It was a few hours ago now.	Kien ftit sigħat ilu issa.
I’m so glad you came.	Jien ferħan ħafna li ġejt.
It’s not for me to doubt.	Mhux għalija li niddubita.
That’s how it all started.	Hekk beda dan kollu.
It makes my job easy.	Jagħmel xogħol tiegħi faċli.
You want to be happy to be with him.	Trid tkun kuntent li tkun miegħu.
Mine are yours.	Tiegħi huma tiegħek.
He didn’t have to tell anyone.	Ma kellu jgħid lil ħadd.
It looked good.	Deher li kien tajjeb.
I would like to think.	Nixtieq naħseb.
All he did.	Dak kollu li għamel.
If tonight.	Jekk illejla.
Neither do you.	U lanqas int.
I hope you can do it and do it right.	Nistenna li inti tista 'tagħmel dan u tagħmel dan tajjeb.
You want to tell me about it.	Trid tgħidli dwarha.
No one was there either.	Ħadd ma kien hemm lanqas.
Or the same.	Jew l-istess.
It had already gone through too much.	Kien diġà għadda minn wisq.
You really know.	Int tkun taf tassew.
They should do both.	Għandhom jagħmlu t-tnejn.
I do everything.	Jien nagħmel kull ħaġa.
It obviously doesn't.	Hija ovvjament ma.
She didn't know anyone.	Ma kienet taf lil ħadd.
I think you are right about that.	Naħseb li għandek raġun dwar dan.
Whatever you want! 	Xi trid!
In fact, we're almost there.	Fil-fatt, aħna qed kważi hemm.
Apparently everyone was already there.	Milli jidher kulħadd kien diġà hemm.
Already a lot.	Diġà ħafna.
Just work.	Biss xogħol.
Everything went well.	Kollox mar tajjeb.
You wish it was otherwise.	Tixtieq li kien mod ieħor.
Well, so too.	Ukoll, hekk ukoll.
But she was thinking.	Imma kienet taħseb.
You look so beautiful now.	Inti tidher daqshekk sabiħa issa.
It was very difficult for him.	Kien diffiċli ħafna għalih.
I'm not sure.	M'inix ċert.
You will do what he says.	Inti se tagħmel dak li jgħid.
It’s just enough and not a little more.	Huwa biss biżżejjed u mhux ftit aktar.
There was no more time to plan.	Ma kienx hemm aktar ħin biex tippjana.
Now they were together.	Issa kienu flimkien.
You can make a lot more money there.	Tista 'tagħmel ħafna aktar flus hemmhekk.
We have more.	Għandna aktar.
It’s actually really bad.	Huwa fil-fatt tassew ħażina.
It can be very good.	Jista 'jkun tajjeb ħafna.
It is working well.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb.
This is just good.	Dan huwa biss tajjeb.
That was not the truth.	Dik ma kinitx il-verità.
He thought about it often.	Huwa ħaseb dwarha spiss.
Not coming back.	Mhux ġej lura.
Something like that.	Xi ħaġa bħal din.
It was harder than he thought.	Kien aktar diffiċli milli kien ħaseb.
There you are alone.	Hemm int biss.
Not sure when it started.	Mhux ċert meta beda.
But there was much more.	Imma kien hemm ħafna aktar.
I can only do so much.	Nista 'biss nagħmel ħafna.
That was good.	Dan kien tajjeb.
I think that would have been wrong.	Naħseb li kien ikun ħażin.
He didn’t say anything, actually.	Ma qal xejn, fil-fatt.
It couldn’t have been easier.	Ma setax ikun aktar faċli.
I wait in the back.	Nistenna fuq wara.
It's happening again.	Qed jerġa’ jiġri.
And, you can do anything about it.	U, inti tista 'tagħmel xejn dwar dan.
No one was very surprised.	Ħadd ma kien sorpriż ħafna.
If she needed to do.	Jekk kellha bżonn tagħmel.
I had never thought about it before.	Qatt ma kont ħsibt dwarha qabel.
Maybe you should do it.	Forsi għandek tagħmel dan.
She is really good.	Hija tassew tajba.
It’s the same as it was before.	Huwa l-istess kif kien qabel.
She didn't know that.	Hija ma kinitx taf li.
It happens fast.	Jiġri malajr.
Nothing is something, or nothing.	Xejn mhu xi ħaġa, jew mhu xejn.
Tell anyone about it.	Tgħid lil ħadd dwarha.
Not one by one.	Mhux waħda waħda.
We want to.	Irridu.
It's not too hard.	Mhuwiex wisq diffiċli.
Or maybe he had.	Jew forsi kellu.
Not even before was it like now.	Lanqas ma qabel kien bħal issa.
But he wasn’t thinking.	Imma ma kienx qed jaħseb.
I'm talking to you.	Jien nitkellem miegħek.
And here again.	U hawn mill-ġdid.
I will not be late.	Mhux se noqgħod tard.
You have someone.	Għandek xi ħadd.
But now we know better.	Imma issa nafu aħjar.
But for me it was more than that.	Imma għalija kien aktar minn hekk.
It should be home.	Għandu jkun id-dar.
It’s pretty much all or nothing.	Huwa pjuttost kollox jew xejn.
I only saw one.	Rajt wieħed biss.
We just are.	Aħna biss aħna.
I think you want something like that.	Naħseb li trid xi ħaġa bħal dik.
Not too late.	Mhux tard wisq.
It was very hard to go.	Kien diffiċli ħafna li tmur.
He will try again.	Huwa ser jerġa' jipprova darba oħra.
He is not alone.	Huwa mhux waħdu.
You are still a child.	Inti għadek tifel.
Or not too early in the evening.	Jew mhux kmieni wisq filgħaxija.
In the afternoon.	Wara nofsinhar.
I’ve always been that way.	Dejjem kont hekk.
Obviously, something is wrong.	Ovvjament, xi ħaġa hija ħażina.
Come and go.	Jiġi u jmur.
Today was really hard for me.	Illum kienet tassew diffiċli għalija.
He loved being alone.	Kien iħobb ikun waħdu.
It could be one or both.	Jista 'jkun jew it-tnejn.
They do so often, you know.	Huma hekk spiss jagħmlu, inti taf.
You.	Inti .
Not looking scared is great.	Li ma jidhirx jibża' huwa kbir.
There is nothing wrong with you.	M'hemm xejn ħażin miegħek.
As far as possible.	Sa fejn u malajr kemm jista 'jkun.
She got where she needed to go.	Wasal fejn kellha bżonn tmur.
No one ever left, and no one ever came.	Qatt ma telaq xi ħadd, u qatt ma ġie ħadd.
I see that said.	Nara li qal.
No one actually knows.	Ħadd fil-fatt ma jaf.
This is actually where it all started.	Dan huwa fil-fatt fejn kollox beda.
It looks like a lot of fun.	Qisu gost ħafna.
It won’t be the first time.	Mhux se tkun l-ewwel darba.
Or the morning after that.	Jew filgħodu wara dak.
He was still a young boy.	Kien għadu tifel żgħir.
I hope it helps someone.	Nispera li jgħin lil xi ħadd.
When you say not all.	Meta tgħid mhux kollha .
He is trying to do good to me.	Huwa qed jipprova jagħmel tajjeb minni.
Today, he knows better.	Illum, jaf aħjar.
Tom was great.	Tom kien kbir.
Today should be easy.	Illum għandu jkun faċli.
Now I can see.	Issa nista' nara.
It went very well.	Mar tajjeb ħafna.
I can only be me.	Jien nista' nkun biss jien.
I'm not going back.	Jien mhux se lura.
He is one and all.	Huwa wieħed u kulħadd.
I've been hearing about this for a while.	Ilni nisma’ dwar dan għal xi żmien.
He was playing together.	Kien jilgħab flimkien.
But not so easy.	Imma mhux daqshekk faċli.
He sure asked on his own.	Huwa żgur li talab waħdu.
Everything was happy.	Kollox kien kuntent.
I talk about it.	Nitkellem dwar dan.
It was enough for him.	Kien biżżejjed għalih.
But no, not much more.	Imma le, mhux wisq aktar.
This felt almost as good as the first.	Dan ħassu kważi tajjeb daqs l-ewwel.
That will never leave me.	Li qatt mhu se jitlaq minni.
You're beautiful, as always.	Int sabiħa, bħal dejjem.
I have no idea where.	M'għandi l-ebda idea fejn.
I’m not here about that.	Jien mhux hawn dwar dan.
This is what it's really all about.	Dan huwa dak li huwa verament kollha dwar.
And we did it all together.	U għamilna kollox flimkien.
He knows how to do it.	Jaf kif jagħmel dan.
The same thing happened to me.	L-istess ġara miegħi.
And this can be so difficult.	U dan jista 'jkun tant diffiċli.
You, more than anything.	Inti, aktar minn kull ħaġa.
I was really worried now.	Jien kont tassew inkwetat issa.
Maybe tell me another soon.	Forsi tgħidli oħra dalwaqt.
No one did anything about it.	Ħadd ma għamel xejn dwarha.
She was not there yet.	Kienet għadha ma kinitx hemm.
He shouldn’t have been here.	Ma kellux ikun hawn.
I'm trying to tell you.	Qed nipprova ngħidlek.
He died shortly afterwards.	Huwa miet ftit wara.
This can take a long time.	Dan jista 'jieħu żmien twil.
It may not be what you think.	Jista 'ma jkunx dak li taħseb.
And why shouldn't he.	U għaliex m'għandux hu.
But not so, no.	Imma mhux hekk, le.
It is, of course.	Huwa, ovvjament.
It's what he has.	Huwa dak li għandu.
That came first.	Dak ġie l-ewwel.
You and I, and everyone.	Int u jien, u kulħadd.
There was something he had to do.	Kien hemm xi ħaġa li kellu jagħmel.
But no, and it doesn’t.	Imma mhux, u ma jagħmilx hekk.
I would be very happy.	Inkun kuntent ħafna.
They just do things.	Huma biss jagħmlu l-affarijiet.
I have to go.	Għandi mmur.
She was not saying anything.	Hija ma kienet tgħid xejn.
Maybe maybe maybe.	Forsi forsi forsi.
I want to hear.	Irrid nisma.
He was not happy.	Ma kienx kuntent.
But not tomorrow.	Imma mhux għada.
He would not wait any longer.	Ma kienx se jistenna aktar.
Maybe you don’t even know who he is.	Forsi lanqas biss taf min hu.
But very good.	Imma tajjeb ħafna.
He has done work here before.	Huwa għamel xogħol hawn qabel.
And he never did.	U qatt ma għamel.
I'm too busy.	Jien okkupat wisq.
No one wants to know.	Ħadd ma jrid ikun jaf.
Obviously I make you happy.	Ovvjament nagħmel inti kuntent.
This is not happening.	Dan mhux qed jiġri.
They are really better.	Huma verament aħjar.
He was not.	Huwa ma kienx.
That was all she knew.	Dan kien dak kollu li kienet taf.
Not this week.	Mhux din il-ġimgħa.
It is very difficult.	Huwa diffiċli ħafna.
It was easy to see why.	Kien faċli li wieħed jara għaliex.
How maybe this was some man she knew.	Kemm forsi dan kien xi raġel li kienet taf.
I’m telling you everything here.	Jien ngħidlek kollox hawn.
If he wants to know, he will.	Jekk irid isir jaf, se.
It can help.	Jista 'jgħin.
You have no job.	M'għandekx xogħol.
I see no problem with that.	Ma nara l-ebda problema b'dan.
No one is talking about it.	Ħadd mhu qed jitkellem dwarha.
Nothing, maybe.	Xejn, forsi.
You can't say that.	Ma tistax tgħid hekk.
You never know who might be watching.	Qatt ma tkun taf min jista’ jkun qed jara.
But this is a very bad idea.	Imma din hija idea ħażina ħafna.
I knew I could.	Kont naf li jista’.
She really is not bad.	Hi tassew mhix ħażina.
And it's hard to do.	U huwa diffiċli li tagħmel.
But no one can.	Imma ħadd ma jista '.
After all, it works for almost everything else.	Wara kollox, jaħdem għal kważi kull ħaġa oħra.
Today, both are back and better than before.	Illum, it-tnejn huma lura u aħjar minn qabel.
That's what happened.	Hekk ġara.
Well, he was a man.	Tajjeb, kien raġel.
Or anything he wanted to do.	Jew xejn li ried jagħmel.
I make money on work like this.	Jien nagħmel flus fuq xogħol bħal dan.
That could be a good thing.	Li tista 'tkun ħaġa tajba.
I know yours, and you know mine.	Jiena naf tiegħek, u int taf tiegħi.
I have to tell you.	Għandi ngħidlek.
I still don't know.	Għadni ma nafx.
I’m telling you to sit down.	Qed ngħidlek toqgħod bilqiegħda.
It seems so long ago.	Jidher li ilu.
That was right.	Dak kien kif suppost.
It had been done very well.	Kien sar tajjeb ħafna.
But, you know.	Imma, taf.
You know all the time.	Int taf il-ħin kollu.
I always had one friend.	Dejjem kelli ħabib wieħed.
Something that was never mine.	Xi ħaġa li qatt ma kienet tiegħi.
That's it, no more.	Dak hu, mhux aktar.
And they all do.	U kollha jagħmlu.
He did this for years.	Huwa għamel dan għal snin li.
You always have been.	Int dejjem kont.
We have enough money.	Għandna biżżejjed flus.
He did it.	Huwa għamel dan.
But we will not go there.	Imma mhux se mmorru hemm.
he thought.	hu ħaseb.
I was surprised to hear this.	Kont sorpriż li smajt dan.
It was happening.	Kien qed jiġri.
You have to think big.	Trid taħseb kbir.
Eat whatever.	Jiekol ikun xi jkun.
I don’t have much to say.	M'għandix ħafna xi ngħid.
It doesn’t work very well.	Ma tantx jaħdem.
He had done nothing wrong.	Ma kien għamel xejn ħażin.
Not that he’s not a good man.	Mhux li mhux raġel tajjeb.
I will say no more.	Mhux se ngħid aktar.
But you must do the following.	Imma trid tagħmel dan li ġej.
Don’t talk like that.	M'għandekx titkellem hekk.
But he wasn’t there afterwards.	Imma ma kienx hemm wara.
We have a lot easier than she.	Għandna ħafna aktar faċli minn hi.
I often do things without thinking.	Ħafna drabi nagħmel affarijiet mingħajr ma naħseb.
It works and it works for everyone.	Jaħdem u jaħdem għal kulħadd.
What is, not who.	X'inhu, mhux min.
I thought it might happen.	Ħsibt li jista 'jiġri.
It was wrong.	Kien ħażin.
Like, how he knew how.	Bħal, kif kien jaf kif.
And she has everything you think and more.	U hi dak kollu li taħseb u aktar.
Everyone is really, really good.	Kulħadd huwa tassew, tassew tajjeb.
I thought for noon.	Ħsibt għal nofsinhar.
I could never understand this.	Qatt ma stajt nifhem dan.
This didn’t have to work that way.	Dan ma kellux jaħdem hekk.
I believe it would take someone.	Nemmen li kienet tieħu lil xi ħadd.
It looks like it will do the job well.	Jidher li se jagħmel ix-xogħol tajjeb.
It was the first time I did that.	Kienet l-ewwel darba li nagħmel hekk.
He did this for a long time.	Huwa għamel dan għal żmien twil.
But some people will make a lot of money.	Imma xi nies se jagħmlu ħafna flus.
I was glad you came back.	Kont ferħan li ġejt lura.
No, that's not all.	Le, dan mhux kollox.
It was easier for me to think so.	Kien aktar faċli għalija naħseb hekk.
It wasn’t enough that it happened.	Ma kienx biżżejjed li ġara.
That’s it, really.	Dak hu, tassew.
All things.	L-affarijiet kollha.
He says so.	Jgħid hekk.
Obviously it wasn’t his first job.	Ovvjament ma kienx l-ewwel xogħol tiegħu.
This happened to me this week.	Dan ġara lili din il-ġimgħa.
In fact.	Fil-fatt .
He didn’t love me.	Ma kienx iħobb miegħi.
But enough about it all.	Imma biżżejjed dwar dan kollu.
It should make this much easier.	Għandu jagħmel dan ħafna aktar faċli.
I’ve seen it for years.	Stajt nara għal snin.
He is doing all he can.	Qed jagħmel dak kollu li jista’.
I did all this on my own.	Dan kollu għamilt waħdek.
I didn’t want to listen.	Ma ridtx nisma.
This looked bad as well.	Dan deher ħażin ukoll.
Like, nothing.	Bħal, xejn.
But in the morning she was doing better.	Imma filgħodu kienet tagħmel aħjar.
I have never seen a better one.	Qatt ma rajt waħda aħjar.
Neither do I.	Jien lanqas.
I'm not with you.	Jien mhux miegħek.
Now he was worried it wasn’t working at all.	Issa kien inkwetat li ma kienx qed jaħdem xejn.
I have to think about this a little more.	Ikolli naħseb dwar dan ftit aktar.
I happened.	I ġara.
It still wasn’t too bad, but it would have been.	Għadu ma kienx ħażin wisq, imma kien ikun.
This is how it looks.	Dan huwa kif jidher.
I can't talk anymore.	Ma nistax nitkellem aktar.
I will never try again.	Qatt ma nerġa' nipprova hekk.
It's too early.	Għadu kmieni.
It was really beautiful.	Kienet tassew sabiħa.
It's all my idea.	Hija kollha idea tiegħi.
In fact it is already there.	Fil-fatt diġà qiegħed hemm.
No one is alone.	Ħadd mhu waħdu.
There is a good boy.	Hemm tifel tajjeb.
I’ll take lunch every time.	Jien ser nieħu nofsinhar kull darba.
It would need to be quite large.	Ikun jeħtieġ li jkun pjuttost kbir.
These things we know and nothing more.	Dawn l-affarijiet nafu u xejn aktar.
I wasn’t able to.	Jien ma kontx kapaċi.
I didn’t know about it.	Ma kontx naf dwar dan.
It will soon be morning.	Dalwaqt ikun filgħodu.
And it works now.	U jaħdem issa.
I’m not telling you again.	Mhux qed ngħidlek mill-ġdid.
I hope you can do it !.	Nittama li tista 'tagħmel dan!.
Currently, he has work to do.	Bħalissa, kellu xogħol xi jagħmel.
Almost everyone had been.	Kważi kulħadd kien ġie.
It's mine again.	Huwa tiegħi mill-ġdid.
No one had to leave.	Ħadd ma kellu jitlaq.
I was a little busy.	Jien kont ftit okkupat.
I knew why.	Kont naf għaliex.
He had little chance.	Ma tantx kellu ċans.
I really can’t wait for that !.	I verament ma nistax nistenna għal dak!.
I heard everything too.	Smajt kollox ukoll.
Everyone wants to buy.	Kulħadd irid jixtri.
Now you want to talk.	Issa trid titkellem.
It would work again.	Kieku jerġa’ jaħdem.
He was going there.	Kien sejjer hemm.
Or they don’t seem to be.	Jew ma jidhirx li huma.
Not only that, but she is a good one as well.	Mhux hekk biss, imma hi waħda tajba barra minn hekk.
No one ever did.	Ħadd qatt ma għamel.
If you ever want to.	Jekk qatt trid.
Some as he said.	Xi kif qal.
You are no longer alone.	M'intix aktar waħdek.
You go without things.	Inti tmur mingħajr affarijiet.
Usually that would be a good thing.	Normalment dik tkun ħaġa tajba.
But it looked good.	Imma deher tajjeb.
You are not fun.	M'intix gost.
I think you will.	Naħseb li inti se.
Who are you really.	Min int verament.
Same people, same fun !.	L-istess nies, l-istess gost!.
This is so good.	Dan huwa tant tajjeb.
But so be it.	Imma hekk ikun.
Don’t say so.	M'għandekx tgħid hekk.
He just went to get something.	Huwa biss mar biex jieħu xi ħaġa.
We have no money.	M'għandniex flus.
The last one was the same.	L-aħħar waħda kienet l-istess.
That’s where it started for me.	Hemmhekk beda għalija.
I have to really sit down and think about it.	Ikolli verament noqgħod bilqiegħda u naħseb dwarha.
It should be soon.	Għandu jkun dalwaqt.
But it was.	Imma kien.
She did the work that seems not to work.	Hija għamlet ix-xogħol li jidher mhux jaħdem.
It's just bad.	Huwa ħażin biss.
She was always alone.	Kienet dejjem waħedha.
Maybe so it should be.	Forsi hekk suppost ikun.
This is what we do now.	Dan huwa dak li nagħmlu issa.
Everything came back to me.	Kollox ġie lura lili.
I can do this later.	I jista 'jagħmel dan aktar tard.
All right now.	Kollox tajjeb issa.
That is not enough.	Dan mhux biżżejjed.
Everyone needs to have a take.	Kulħadd jeħtieġ li jkollu jieħu.
I’m not so sure now.	M'inix daqshekk ċert issa.
It's all mine.	Huwa kollox tiegħi.
She is not like other people.	Hija mhix bħal nies oħra.
It just happens.	Jiġri biss.
Whatever it is.	Ikun xi jkun dan.
But tell me no.	Imma tgħidli le.
I needed to do that.	Jien kelli bżonn nagħmel dan.
But it was too late to go back.	Imma kien tard wisq biex tmur lura.
I didn't have time to.	Ma kellix ħin biex.
Not better people.	Mhux nies aħjar.
Pretty much, really.	Pjuttost ħafna, tassew.
She will say no.	Hi se tgħid le.
Now he was scared.	Issa kien jibża.
She wasn’t here and now she is.	Hija ma kinitx hawn u issa hi.
But it is very good.	Imma huwa tajjeb ħafna.
And that’s when it all came out.	U dak meta ħareġ kollox.
In fact, it shouldn’t take too long.	Fil-fatt, m'għandux jieħu wisq ħin.
But it doesn’t do that either.	Imma dan lanqas ma jagħmel.
We both knew why.	It-tnejn konna nafu għaliex.
And that can be a very good thing.	U din tista’ tkun xi ħaġa tajba ħafna.
I'll tell you why.	Jien ngħidlek għaliex.
Let's go home.	Ejja lejn id-dar.
You can't do that.	Ma tistax tagħmel dan.
Timing is helpful, but never good enough.	Iż-żmien huwa ta’ għajnuna, imma qatt tajjeb biżżejjed.
This is a one-time thing.	Din hija ħaġa ta' darba biss.
You know what I'm saying? 	Inti taf x'qed ngħid?
No one is like that.	Ħadd mhu hekk.
I'll buy it again next week.	Nerġa’ nixtri għalih il-ġimgħa d-dieħla.
That’s me.	Dak hu għalija.
This is going to be a big problem for me.	Din se tkun problema kbira għalija.
We always knew each other.	Konna nafu dejjem lil xulxin.
Loved playing.	Iħobb jilgħab.
I'm still not sure.	Għadni mhux ċert.
Now we know we were right all the time.	Issa nafu li kellna raġun il-ħin kollu.
I have to say so much.	Trid ngħid daqshekk.
I can hardly believe that.	Ma tantx nista nemmen li.
I never want to be that way.	Qatt ma rrid inkun hekk.
I didn’t have a car.	Ma kellix karozza.
You are there, now.	Int hemm, issa.
I saw everything.	Rajt kollox.
It will only work.	Huwa se jaħdem biss.
Everyone went back.	Kulħadd mar lura.
It was much better.	Kien ħafna aħjar.
I understand why someone wants that all the time.	Nifhem għaliex xi ħadd irid dak il-ħin kollu.
They again, she was thinking.	Huma mill-ġdid, kienet qed taħseb.
It wasn’t the first time.	Ma kinitx l-ewwel darba.
For almost a year he made none.	Għal kważi sena ma għamel l-ebda waħda.
But nothing was there.	Imma xejn ma kien hemm.
Or a little more.	Jew ftit aktar.
There is something wrong with me.	Hemm xi ħaġa ħażina miegħi.
And there is much more.	U hemm ħafna aktar.
It does a good job of that as well.	Jagħmel xogħol tajjeb minn hekk ukoll.
Maybe he is.	Forsi hu.
She is.	Hija hi.
All of this seemed to work very well.	Dan kollu deher li jaħdem tajjeb ħafna.
I always was me.	Jien dejjem kont jien.
Also, I was willing to tell anyone.	Barra minn hekk, kont lest li tgħid lil xi ħadd.
I’ve only been there once.	Jien kont hemm darba biss.
I don’t need one.	M'għandix bżonn wieħed.
I think we should go.	Naħseb li għandna mmorru.
That took a while.	Dak ħa ftit.
He doesn’t know anyone else.	Ma jaf lil ħadd ieħor.
It would be a lot of work for nothing.	Ikun ħafna xogħol għal xejn.
There was someone else, there was always someone else.	Kien hemm xi ħadd ieħor, dejjem kien hemm xi ħadd ieħor.
Which is more likely.	Li huwa aktar probabbli.
He wasn’t ready for this now.	Ma kienx lest għal dan issa.
They are my friends.	Huma ħbieb tiegħi.
Can anyone help ?.	Jista' xi ħadd jgħin?.
I can see it all.	Nista 'nara dan kollu.
It always has been and always will be.	Dejjem kien u dejjem kien ikun.
Just all of my following.	Eżatt dak kollu li ġej tiegħi.
Either first or last, or both.	Jew l-ewwel jew l-aħħar, jew it-tnejn.
He was out of work.	Huwa kien barra xogħol.
That was wrong.	Li kien ħażin.
He had a son.	Kellu tifel.
I need you to come as soon as possible.	Għandi bżonn li tiġi malajr kemm tista’.
Someone had to go.	Xi ħadd kellu jmur.
There seemed to be no way out of this.	Deher li ma kien hemm l-ebda mod minn dan.
Someone else can do the same.	Xi ħadd ieħor jista 'jagħmel l-istess.
I want everyone out here.	Irrid lil kulħadd hawn barra.
But it only happened once.	Imma ġara darba biss.
Enough of all this.	Biżżejjed dan kollu.
He sure had it with him.	Huwa żgur li kellu miegħu.
And it wasn’t easy.	U ma kienx faċli.
But it's yours.	Imma huwa tiegħek.
It was quite a few years ago.	Kien pjuttost ftit snin ilu.
I’ve been eating so much lately.	Jien kont niekol tant dan l-aħħar.
You can be both.	Tista 'tkun it-tnejn.
There is always time.	Dejjem hemm ħin.
I have, a few times.	Għandi, ftit drabi.
It will never do.	Qatt mhu se tagħmel.
It’s for both of us.	Huwa għalina t-tnejn.
I wonder if it is always so.	Nistaqsi jekk hux dejjem hekk.
There should be no.	M'għandux ikun hemm.
She is not a child.	Hija mhix tifel.
And they sure do.	U żgur li jagħmlu.
They are doing something.	Huma qed jagħmlu xi ħaġa.
Going alone is hard.	Li tmur waħdu huwa diffiċli.
It was what she always did.	Kien dak li dejjem għamlet.
I was too scared to try.	Kont nibża’ wisq biex nipprova.
For me, for him, for us.	Għalija, għalih, għalina.
And you are right.	U għandek raġun.
Now he said this all the time.	Issa qal dan il-ħin kollu.
On and on it goes.	Fuq u fuq imur.
You have to go home.	Għandek tmur id-dar.
Never do it again.	Qatt tagħmel dan mill-ġdid.
I'm sure it was.	Jien ċert li kien.
This was difficult.	Dan kien diffiċli.
I hope to talk to you soon.	Nispera li nitkellem miegħek dalwaqt.
There is much more to it than that.	Hemm ħafna aktar minn hekk.
I couldn’t be alone.	Ma stajtx inkun waħdi.
We did nothing.	Aħna ma għamilna xejn.
Very late.	Tard ħafna.
He could not speak.	Ma setax jitkellem.
They were just people, after all.	Kienu biss nies, wara kollox.
It will not happen.	Mhux se jiġri.
You may never have seen one before.	Jista’ jkun li qatt ma ra waħda qabel.
It’s too early for another.	Huwa kmieni wisq għal ieħor.
That will not happen.	Dak mhux se jiġri.
Something like that, she thinks.	Xi ħaġa bħal dik, taħseb hi.
Maybe just me.	Forsi jien biss.
He had to be waiting for me.	Huwa kellu jkun qed jistenna lili.
He enjoyed doing it, too.	Huwa ħa gost jagħmel dan, ukoll.
He was trying to do.	Kien qed jipprova jagħmel.
It becomes easier.	Isir aktar faċli.
It was never there.	Qatt ma kien hemm.
It was no better.	Ma kienx aħjar.
I never thought this would actually happen.	Qatt ma ħsibt li dan jista’ jiġri fil-fatt.
If you are right, it would be good enough.	Jekk għandek raġun, ikun tajjeb biżżejjed.
That was a very good idea.	Dik kienet idea tajba ħafna.
From one thing, everyone knows the house.	Minn ħaġa waħda, kulħadd jaf id-dar.
He says.	Jgħid.
I did so.	Jien għamilt hekk.
Maybe it's not easy.	Forsi ma jkunx faċli.
It had been a long time.	Kien ilu twil.
It was hard to know.	Kien diffiċli li tkun taf.
Many years later.	Ħafna snin wara.
They were all back to school.	Kienu kollha lura l-iskola.
Today we do.	Illum nagħmlu.
We both have.	Aħna t-tnejn għandhom.
Almost everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong.	Kważi dak kollu li seta’ mar ħażin, mar ħażin.
It has always been so.	Dejjem kien hekk.
Not an easy one.	Mhux waħda faċli.
But you can’t go back now.	Imma ma tistax tmur lura issa.
Everything is almost ready.	Kollox huwa kważi lest.
Everything you need to know.	Dak kollu li għandek bżonn tkun taf.
It can happen sooner rather than later.	Jista 'jiġri aktar kmieni milli aktar tard.
We are not what we do.	Aħna mhux dak li nagħmlu.
I am very sorry about the car.	Jiddispjaċini ħafna dwar il-karozza.
From around.	Minn madwar.
And it was better.	U kien aħjar.
Let's go.	Ejja mmorru.
But nothing more.	Imma xejn aktar.
He looked at nothing or anyone.	Hu ma ħares xejn jew lil ħadd.
I was still young.	Kont għadni żgħir.
But I don’t know how to do that.	Imma ma nafx kif tagħmel dan.
Well, it is.	Ukoll, huwa.
John said very little.	John qal ftit li xejn.
So it was.	Hekk kien.
It seems so, perhaps.	Jidher hekk, forsi.
I’m here to do his job.	Jien hawn biex nagħmel ix-xogħol tiegħu.
It may be time now.	Jista’ jkun li issa jkun iż-żmien.
I saw myself.	Jien rajt jien.
The problem is that this only happens once.	Il-problema hi li dan jiġri darba biss.
No one thought anyone would ever come here.	Ħadd ma ħaseb li xi ħadd qatt jiġi hawn.
This was never going to work.	Dan qatt ma kien se jaħdem.
I need someone to stay with me.	Għandi bżonn xi ħadd li jibqa’ miegħi.
I can be the same.	Jien nista' nkun l-istess.
It was something difficult for him.	Kienet xi ħaġa diffiċli għalih.
I will try now.	Se nipprova issa.
.	.
You go home.	Inti tmur id-dar.
It does everything you need.	Jagħmel dak kollu li għandek bżonn.
It doesn’t.	Dan ma jagħmilx hekk.
But he soon leaves.	Imma dalwaqt jitlaq.
But it's too late.	Imma huwa tard wisq.
I fell in love with him.	Kont inħobb miegħu.
Who I was was great.	Min kont kien kbir.
He loved my job.	Kien iħobb ix-xogħol tiegħi.
You can't do that.	Inti ma tistax tagħmel dan.
He had never said anything like that.	Qatt ma kellu qal xi ħaġa bħal dik.
I will ask again.	Se nerġa' nistaqsi.
That will be our thing.	Dik se tkun ħaġa tagħna.
We do all these things together.	Aħna nagħmlu dawn l-affarijiet kollha flimkien.
I like him a lot.	Jien inħobb ħafna miegħu.
He was here, but he had to leave.	Kien hawn, imma kellu jitlaq.
he asked.	staqsa.
The job is yours.	Ix-xogħol huwa tiegħek.
As he was doing.	Kif kien qed jagħmel.
I better go back.	Aħjar immur lura.
A really great person.	Persuna tassew kbira.
She was still here.	Kienet għadha hawn.
You were seated.	Int kont bilqiegħda.
It’s like everything else.	Huwa bħal kull ħaġa oħra.
But you know better now.	Imma taf aħjar issa.
I can’t wait here.	Ma nistax nistenna hawn.
No one wants to go first.	Ħadd ma jrid imur l-ewwel.
There is nothing we can do.	M'hemm xejn li nistgħu nagħmlu.
You did well.	Int għamilt tajjeb.
He wanted so little.	Ried daqshekk ftit.
This is not working.	Dan mhux qed jaħdem.
It would be later for me.	Ikun aktar tard għalija.
There was no one he wanted to say.	Ma kien hemm ħadd li kien ried jgħid.
I hope you get better after a while.	Nispera li tkun aħjar wara xi żmien.
He just got here.	Għadu kif wasal hawn.
He was not alone here.	Ma kienx waħdu hawn.
Sooner or later it will.	Illum jew għada se.
But there were many.	Imma kien hemm ħafna.
They never do that.	Huma qatt ma jagħmlu dan.
She doesn't want to.	Hi ma tridx.
Now it was too late.	Issa kien tard wisq.
I can’t say for sure now.	Ma nistax ngħid żgur issa.
I have one.	Ikolli wieħed.
Everything out.	Dak kollu barra.
You can't say that.	Ma tistax tgħid dan.
This is really a lot.	Dan huwa tassew ħafna.
They were useless.	Ma kienu ta’ xejn.
Nobody wanted to.	Ħadd ma ried.
Everything we have right now.	Dak kollu li għandna bħalissa.
But no one knew.	Imma ħadd ma kien jaf.
Don't do that.	M'għandekx tagħmel dan.
You already know something.	Diġà taf xi ħaġa.
And there is something else.	U hemm ħaġa oħra.
No way works.	L-ebda mod ma jaħdem.
That, and nothing more.	Dak, u xejn aktar.
And so it was.	U dan kien hekk.
But not always so.	Imma mhux dejjem hekk.
She wanted that.	Hija kienet tixtieq li.
I think we have the same.	Naħseb li għandna l-istess.
And it never will.	U qatt mhu se.
Or maybe that’s what you want.	Jew forsi dak hu li trid.
He is still talking.	Għadu qed jitkellem.
So it is with me.	Hekk hu miegħi.
You know how to do it.	Taf kif jagħmel.
No, now was the time to do it.	Le, issa kien iż-żmien li tagħmel dan.
It is not so.	Mhuwiex daqshekk hekk.
There is no one about.	M'hemm ħadd dwar.
Presently she looked back.	Bħalissa hi ħares lura.
What to do now.	X'għandu jagħmel issa.
I shouldn’t do that.	M'għandix nagħmel hekk.
Everything is working pretty well now.	Kollox pjuttost jaħdem kif suppost issa.
Usually, that’s not a problem.	Normalment, dik mhix problema.
It would have been.	Kien ikun.
I may or may not stay.	I tista 'toqgħod jew le.
Too quick to tell, maybe.	Malajr wisq biex tgħid, forsi.
He took it and did nothing.	Huwa ħa u ma għamel xejn.
It was too big there.	Kien kbir wisq hemmhekk.
Sure, hard.	Żgur, diffiċli.
You don’t want to see.	Ma tridx tara.
I do to.	Nagħmel biex.
It’s always, always good.	Huwa dejjem, dejjem tajjeb.
I was alone.	Jien kont waħdi.
He is a good boy.	Huwa tifel tajjeb.
Or, maybe just me.	Jew, forsi jien biss.
Everything was happening too fast.	Kollox kien qed jiġri wisq malajr.
But you don’t have to come with me.	Imma m'għandekx għalfejn tiġi miegħi.
And there it was.	U kien hemm.
For me, you were a friend.	Għalija, inti kont ħabib.
They are right, you know.	Għandhom raġun, taf.
Soon everything will be fine again.	Dalwaqt kollox ikun tajjeb mill-ġdid.
It's still here.	Għadu hawn.
For many, it was too late.	Għal ħafna, kien tard wisq.
So you’re having fun.	Hekk qed tieħu gost.
But it was always worth a try.	Imma dejjem kien ta’ min jipprova.
We are.	Aħna huma.
What's wrong with me? 	X'hemm ħażin miegħi?
We will not go back.	Aħna mhux se mmorru lura.
She had people to see.	Kellha nies x’tara.
We have to do something.	Irridu nagħmlu xi ħaġa.
He knew what he needed.	Kien jaf x’għandu bżonn.
Or more, of course.	Jew aktar, ovvjament.
We had a great time with this.	Kellna żmien tajjeb b’dan.
We were there, together, all morning.	Konna hemm, flimkien, filgħodu kollu.
When you know what you want.	Meta tkun taf xi trid.
He told me to.	Huwa qalli biex.
A little too late.	Ftit wisq tard.
He’s here all the time, too.	Huwa hawn il-ħin kollu, ukoll.
And it's not really.	U mhuwiex verament.
I heard nothing.	Ma smajt xejn.
Maybe this is a big deal.	Forsi din hija xi ħaġa kbira.
That was him.	Li kien hu.
About this, time only says.	Dwar dan, iż-żmien biss jgħid.
He knows no one was here.	Jaf li kien hawn ħadd.
That's not good.	Dak mhux tajjeb.
Good and good, but no more.	Tajjeb u tajjeb, imma mhux aktar.
You have been before.	Inti kont minn qabel.
I had never thought of that before.	Qatt ma ħsibt hekk qabel.
Not good yet, but better.	Għadu mhux tajjeb, imma aħjar.
Where it came from.	Minn fejn ġie.
I think many are with you.	Naħseb li ħafna huma miegħek.
Everything was so still.	Kollox kien hekk għadu.
He wasn’t playing either.	Ma kienx qed jilgħab lanqas.
It took a long time.	Ħa ħafna żmien.
He knew nothing of this.	Ma kien jaf xejn minn dan.
He didn’t even want to be alone.	Hu lanqas biss ried ikun waħdu.
Maybe they are.	Forsi huma.
It looked bad.	Deher ħażin.
It doesn’t.	Ma jagħmilx hekk.
I thought that was what I thought.	Ħsibt li kien dak li ħsibt.
Maybe he will survive, maybe not.	Forsi se jgħix, forsi le.
Never, ever was.	Qatt, qatt ma kien.
This could not have happened.	Dan ma setax ġara.
And it has to.	U dan għandu.
And you have to be good.	U trid tkun tajjeb.
Definitely one to see.	Żgur wieħed biex tara.
You have to do it on your own.	Int għandek tagħmel dan waħdek.
She was going to say something but no.	Kienet se tgħid xi ħaġa imma le.
I did everything on my own.	Jien għamilt kollox waħdi.
I believe that.	Jien nemmen li.
I believe that one day everything will be fine.	Jien nemmen li xi darba se jkun kollox tajjeb.
It probably won’t be the last.	Probabbilment mhux se jkun l-aħħar.
I will never be able to.	Jien qatt ma nkun kapaċi.
I must have done something wrong.	I għandu għamilt xi ħaġa ħażina.
I don’t have time for this right now.	M'għandix ħin għal dan bħalissa.
Well, almost no one.	Ukoll, kważi ħadd.
I was working on it in no time.	Jien kont qiegħed jaħdem fi ftit ħin.
Where he or she was.	Fejn kien hu jew hi.
Everyone knows everything.	Kulħadd jaf kollox.
She wasn’t anyone.	Hija ma kinitx xi ħadd.
Why, there he is, now.	Għaliex, hemmhekk hu, issa.
Everyone thinks you are doing something.	Kulħadd jaħseb li qed tagħmel xi ħaġa.
But not mine.	Imma mhux tiegħi.
We can never go back.	Nistgħu qatt ma mmorru lura.
It’s probably a good thing he did.	Probabbilment hija ħaġa tajba li għamel.
But he would not.	Imma ma kienx se.
I’m just surprised, you know.	Jien biss sorpriż, taf.
I wanted to be the last.	Ridt inkun l-aħħar.
Your time.	Il-ħin tiegħek.
Or as it was.	Jew kif kien.
No one will ever know I was here once.	Ħadd qatt mhu se jkun jaf li kont hawn darba.
Some need for it.	Xi bżonn għalih.
But you don’t want to be here.	Imma ma tridx tkun hawn.
That wasn’t so long ago.	Dan ma kienx daqshekk twil ilu.
That’s really what it was.	Dak hu verament dak li kien.
It really seems like a lot to me.	Tassew jidher qisu ħafna għalija.
He will do his best to win.	Huwa se jagħmel minn kollox biex jirbaħ.
But you.	Imma int.
I buy some.	Nixtri xi ftit.
I will hardly be able to tell you.	Jien ma tantx inkun kapaċi ngħidlek.
I do everything.	Jien nagħmel kollox.
You eat, and you eat well.	Tiekol, u tiekol tajjeb.
Try to do things on your own.	Jipprova jagħmel l-affarijiet waħdu.
Now this is going to be great.	Issa dan se jkun kbir.
I really will.	Jien verament se.
Maybe, once, they were people.	Forsi, darba, kienu nies.
You really are.	Int tassew.
He said he felt alone here.	Qal li ħassu waħdu hawn.
And it happens again.	U jerġa’ jiġri.
Whatever she needed.	Tkun xi tkun kellha bżonn.
This was where she lived.	Dan kien fejn kienet toqgħod.
But you know better.	Imma taf aħjar.
But that was a long time ago.	Imma dan kien ilu.
Everything was coming back to me now.	Kollox kien ġej lura għandi issa.
I know a man who lost a car there.	Naf raġel li tilef karozza hemmhekk.
Really, pretty much.	Tassew, pjuttost ħafna.
This I didn’t know until after it happened.	Dan ma kontx taf sa wara li ġara.
That was me too.	Dak kont jien ukoll.
We know it will likely happen.	Nafu x'aktarx li se jiġri.
This can be anything.	Dan jista 'jkun xi ħaġa.
You said to be together.	Inti għedt li nkunu flimkien.
This doesn’t seem to work.	Dan ma jidhirx li jaħdem.
And we will never go back.	U aħna qatt mhu ser lura.
I’m not sure how he did it.	M'inix ċert kif għamel dan.
I did too much.	Għamilt wisq.
Well, so it was.	Ukoll, hekk kien.
It's not that hard.	Mhuwiex daqshekk diffiċli.
You can talk about it forever.	Tista’ titkellem dwarha għal dejjem.
That's one thing I am.	Dik ħaġa waħda jien.
I didn’t want to talk about it before.	Ma ridtx titkellem dwarha qabel.
And that can only be a good thing.	U dik tista’ tkun biss ħaġa tajba.
Say everything.	Għid kollox.
This is difficult.	Dan huwa diffiċli.
I want you to tell me what happened.	Irrid li tgħidli x’ġara.
But you should know this.	Imma għandek tkun taf dan.
It didn’t seem likely.	Ma deherx probabbli.
No one knew who he was.	Ħadd ma kien jaf min kien.
You can do the same if you want.	Tista' tagħmel l-istess jekk tixtieq.
On and on you go.	Fuq u fuq inti tmur.
No, it's not, really.	Le, mhuwiex, tassew.
That was also something she did.	Dik kienet ukoll xi ħaġa li għamlet.
Alone very, very much.	Waħdu ħafna, ħafna.
I’m not supposed to say that.	Jien mhux suppost ngħid hekk.
But that was right.	Imma dan kien kif suppost.
I'm listening to things.	Qed nisma’ affarijiet.
You never will be.	Inti qatt ma tkun.
That is what you have to do.	Li huwa dak li għandek tagħmel.
He did well all the time.	Huwa mar tajjeb il-ħin kollu.
No one we knew.	Ħadd ma konna nafu.
Well, we both did.	Ukoll, it-tnejn għamilna.
It has always happened.	Dejjem ikun ġara.
This never happened.	Dan qatt ma ġara.
But it was not as it was before.	Imma ma kienx kif kien qabel.
Most people were definitely there.	Ħafna nies żgur li kienu hemm.
I think it would.	Naħseb li kieku.
Everything is still good.	Għadu kollox tajjeb.
I wonder what happened to me.	Nistaqsi x’ġara lili.
This is preschool.	Dan huwa qabel l-iskola.
She had to know better.	Hi kellha tkun taf aħjar.
There is always someone watching.	Dejjem hemm xi ħadd jara.
I don’t know where to go.	Ma nafx fejn immur.
He wants to go to work.	Irid imur ix-xogħol.
But there is something.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa.
I’m so with you on this.	Jien hekk miegħek fuq dan.
And on and on.	U fuq u fuq.
You know where she is.	Taf fejn hi.
In the evening.	Filgħaxija.
You probably never thought about it.	Probabbilment qatt ma ħaseb dwarha.
Not always good.	Mhux dejjem tajjeb.
Not to anyone.	Mhux lil ħadd.
Not often there are only two.	Mhux ta’ spiss ikun hemm it-tnejn biss.
It says a lot.	Jgħid ħafna.
You really don’t want to do that.	Int verament ma tridx tagħmel dan.
I hope he is.	Nispera li se.
That’s what he wanted.	Dak hu li ried.
We were each other.	Konna lil xulxin.
I understand that as well.	Nifhem hekk ukoll.
I think it could be.	Naħseb li jista 'jkun.
Later, it wasn’t.	Aktar tard, ma kienx.
After that there are quite a few.	Wara li hemm pjuttost ftit.
Already always.	Diġà dejjem.
I want to talk to you.	Irrid nitkellem miegħek.
It won’t be the last either.	Ma tkunx l-aħħar lanqas.
And now we know why.	U issa nafu għaliex.
This has happened more than once.	Dan ġara aktar minn darba.
She wouldn’t tell me how much he had.	Ma kinitx tgħidli kemm kellu.
It's just like that.	Huwa biss hekk.
She would not be able to do that.	Hija ma tkunx tista 'tagħmel dan.
Maybe she was alone here.	Forsi kienet waħedha hawn.
And you ?.	U inti?.
Hard to eat at home for this.	Diffiċli li tiekol id-dar għal dan.
But not.	Imma mhux.
It was late.	Kien sar tard.
Which is great.	Li huwa kbir.
But that will happen.	Imma dak se jiġri.
Later that evening.	Aktar tard dik il-lejla.
He couldn't do that either.	Lanqas seta’ għamel hekk.
Maybe more than one.	Forsi aktar minn wieħed.
She was here not very.	Kienet hawn ma tantx.
That very time.	Dak iż-żmien ħafna.
Which is what he doesn’t do here.	Li hu li ma jagħmilx hawn.
I like to wait and see.	Inħobb nistenna u nara.
Whatever you want.	Tkun xi tkun tixtieq.
You want something more.	Trid xi ħaġa aktar.
But it was not so.	Imma ma kienx hekk.
I will buy again.	Se nerġa nixtri.
And of course that’s a good thing.	U ovvjament dik hija ħaġa tajba.
It takes too much time.	Huwa jieħu wisq ħin.
And it was, for a while.	U kien, għal xi żmien.
Everything will be coming soon.	Kollox ser jiġi dalwaqt.
I don’t know for sure.	Ma nafx żgur.
This happens.	Dan jiġri.
He wasn’t sure how many were out there.	Ma kienx ċert kemm kien hemm barra.
It was late.	Kien tard.
She needed time.	Hija kellha bżonn iż-żmien.
I know you like it that way.	Naf li tixtieq hekk.
And it's almost there.	U huwa kważi hemm.
But it was almost never good enough.	Imma kważi qatt ma kienet tajba biżżejjed.
He had to leave.	Kellu jitlaq.
We know a few other things not.	Nafu ftit affarijiet oħra mhux.
You are too young.	Inti żgħir wisq.
It was beautiful, sure.	Kienet sabiħa, żgur.
I have already seen one.	Diġà rajt wieħed.
He may be playful.	Huwa jista 'jkun jilgħab.
I haven’t been able to do this before.	Ma stajtx nagħmel dan qabel.
I don’t think they do much.	Ma naħsibx li jagħmlu ħafna.
I tell you that for nothing.	Jien ngħidlek li għal xejn.
I like that makes me.	Jien bħal dik tagħmel lili.
Something just for you.	Xi ħaġa għalik biss.
It looked good.	Huwa ħares tajjeb.
And it’s actually not for me.	U fil-fatt mhuwiex għalija.
It wasn’t that small.	Ma kienx daqshekk żgħir.
He was glad.	Huwa kien ferħan.
You want to do so well.	Trid tagħmel hekk tajjeb.
I'm the size of someone.	Jien daqs xi ħadd.
And we need everyone to work together.	U għandna bżonn li kulħadd jaħdem flimkien.
It shouldn’t have happened, of course.	Ma kellux jiġri, ovvjament.
But it looked good.	Imma deher tajjeb.
They felt so much better.	Ħassu ħafna aħjar.
This so far.	Dan sa issa.
We are doing our.	Aħna qed nagħmlu tagħna.
Not yours.	Mhux tiegħek.
It wasn’t really you.	Ma kontx verament int.
So it was done exactly.	Hekk sar eżatt.
I was a child at the time.	Kont tifel dak iż-żmien.
No one had ever asked.	Ħadd qatt ma kien talab.
This is going to be great.	Dan se jkun kbir.
He hadn’t thought about it.	Ma kienx ħaseb dwarha.
Probably the same as everything else here.	Probabbilment l-istess bħal kull ħaġa oħra hawn.
This is pretty easy.	Dan huwa pjuttost faċli.
We don’t need that.	M'għandniex bżonn dak.
You know what will happen if it is too long.	Taf x'se jiġri jekk tkun twil wisq.
I can’t understand how I do that.	Ma nistax nifhem kif nagħmel dan.
I want to never go back.	Irrid qatt ma mmur lura.
But no, he was still there.	Imma le, kien għadu hemm.
I don’t know what you really want to do.	Ma nafx xi trid tagħmel tassew.
He knew it was going to be his last.	Kien jaf li kien se jkun l-aħħar tiegħu.
She had no more money.	Hija ma kinitx aktar flus.
Talk to him.	Jitkellem miegħu.
There was no one in the back.	Ma kien hemm ħadd fuq wara.
But he told the truth.	Imma qal il-verità.
Okay, maybe.	Tajjeb, forsi.
Easy, it should be.	Faċli, għandu jkun.
Some time later, he died.	Xi żmien ftit wara, miet.
But so it appeared last night.	Imma hekk deher ilbieraħ filgħaxija.
That’s never fun.	Dak qatt mhu gost.
And it was so for a long time.	U kien hekk għal żmien twil.
Now I have one.	Issa għandi waħda.
There is no way to know.	M'hemm l-ebda mod kif tkun taf.
And of course he is right.	U ovvjament għandu raġun.
There 's something wrong with all this, and.	Hemm xi ħaġa ħażina dwar dan kollu, u .
It will take work.	Se tieħu xogħol.
The last one.	L-aħħar waħda.
It was bad, very bad.	Kien ħażin, ħażin ħafna.
Not happy, either.	Mhux kuntent, lanqas.
It’s his last chance.	Huwa l-aħħar ċans tiegħu.
Everything has to be.	Dak kollu jrid ikun.
I was never there.	Qatt ma kont hemm.
I thought it was my time.	Ħsibt li kien iż-żmien tiegħi.
Or tonight.	Jew illejla.
You wouldn't want that, would you ?.	Inti ma tkunx trid li, kieku inti?.
I didn’t know how long it would take.	Ma kontx naf kemm kien se jieħu.
And now he's here, in love with one.	U issa kien hawn, iħobb ma’ wieħed.
That pretty much says it.	Li pjuttost tgħid dan.
How anyone knew, he didn’t know.	Kif kien jaf xi ħadd, ma kienx jaf.
But she is too late.	Imma hi tard wisq.
But try.	Imma ipprova.
Definitely did.	Żgur li għamilt.
We can do that now.	Nistgħu nagħmlu dan issa.
It was at work.	Kien fuq ix-xogħol.
And they are not doing anything.	U mhu qed jagħmlu xejn.
It didn't take long.	Ma kienx ħa twil.
It’s about being good enough to survive.	Huwa dwar li jkun tajjeb biżżejjed biex jgħix.
He did really well.	Huwa għamel tassew tajjeb.
She may know something, that's all.	Hija tista 'tkun taf xi ħaġa, dak kollox.
I want to be sure of that.	Irrid inkun ċert minn dan.
I don't need to.	M'inix bżonn.
I believe in doing just that.	Nemmen li tagħmel dan biss.
Nobody in the room.	Ħadd fil-kamra.
It is always this.	Huwa dejjem dan.
Someone had put this together.	Xi ħadd kien poġġa dan flimkien.
You want to talk to him.	Trid titkellem miegħu.
I wasn’t worried.	Ma kontx inkwetat.
That was a lot of money.	Dak kien ħafna flus.
It is both good and bad.	Huwa kemm tajjeb kif ukoll ħażin.
But none of this came out.	Imma xejn minn dan ma ħareġ.
Most of me.	Ħafna minni.
But it always comes back to me.	Imma dejjem tiġi lura għandi.
You know what that is.	Inti taf x'inhu dak.
Nothing was wrong.	Xejn ma kien ħażin.
I think that says a lot about school.	Naħseb li dan jgħid ħafna dwar l-iskola.
That's all.	Dak hu biss.
This is for me.	Dan huwa għalija.
We were very tired.	Konna għajjien ħafna.
There is no way around this.	M'hemm l-ebda mod madwar dan.
She knew it was there.	Kienet taf li kien hemm.
I hope they do more.	Nittama li jagħmlu aktar.
I like to talk.	Inħobb nitkellem.
Big is enough.	Kbir huwa biżżejjed.
She had never been here alone before.	Qatt ma kienet hawn waħedha qabel.
She knew.	Kienet taf.
I need to do this more often.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan aktar spiss.
I did a lot of work here for him.	Għamilt ħafna xogħol hawn għalih.
I can’t see one thing.	Ma nistax nara ħaġa waħda.
But it needs something.	Imma jeħtieġ xi ħaġa.
Someone, something else was here.	Xi ħadd, xi ħaġa oħra kien hawn.
He is happy to be there.	Huwa kuntent li jkun hemm.
We didn’t have much of anything.	Aħna ma kellna ħafna minn xejn.
He really loved to eat alone.	Verament kien iħobb jiekol biss waħdu.
And it would only take one.	U kien jieħu wieħed biss.
It is ready to be so.	Huwa lest li jkun hekk.
You are truly a good friend.	Int tassew ħabib tajjeb.
That job had to be mine.	Dak ix-xogħol kellu jkun tiegħi.
.	.
He was speaking the truth.	Kien qed jitkellem il-verità.
I need to do this myself.	Għandi bżonn nagħmel dan jien.
Just as she had when.	Hekk kif kellha meta .
Nothing, actually.	Xejn, fil-fatt.
This is not so great.	Dan mhux daqshekk kbir.
I was quite interested.	Kont pjuttost interessat.
He just has no more.	Huwa biss m'għandux aktar.
We were just people.	Konna biss nies.
Maybe he shouldn’t have said so.	Forsi ma kellux qal hekk.
I can’t understand how I should do that.	Ma nistax nifhem kif għandi nagħmel dan.
I’m ready to know now.	Jien lest li nkun naf issa.
And things and things and more things.	U affarijiet u affarijiet u aktar affarijiet.
Not so bad.	Mhux daqshekk ħażin.
And now you are too.	U issa int ukoll.
Of course it could have been anyone else.	Ovvjament seta’ kien ħadd ieħor.
You can't even.	Inti lanqas biss tista '.
I suspect he has a lot.	Nissuspetta li għandu ħafna.
I thought about it.	Ħsibt dwar dan.
That’s not good, nothing good.	Dak mhux tajjeb, xejn tajjeb.
Someone has to do it.	Xi ħadd irid jagħmel dan.
Well no time.	Ukoll l-ebda ħin.
How would she be.	Kif tkun hi.
But he did nothing.	Imma xejn ma għamel.
It's not much.	Mhuwiex ħafna.
I can hear it coming now.	Nista’ nisma’ ġej issa.
It can make things easier.	Jista 'jagħmel l-affarijiet aktar faċli.
You will come when we.	Int se tiġi meta aħna.
He will not leave.	Hu mhux se jitlaq.
I wonder why.	Qed nistaqsi għaliex.
It wasn’t that hard.	Ma kienx daqshekk diffiċli.
It has never been so for me before.	Qatt ma kien hekk għalija qabel.
It had been coming for a long time.	Kien ġej għal żmien twil.
It is working well.	Qed jaħdem tajjeb.
And of course.	U ovvjament.
But no one will.	Imma ħadd ma se.
I would be all over that.	Inkun kollu fuq dak.
That’s good, too.	Dak tajjeb, ukoll.
This is the only thing anyone is talking about.	Din hija l-unika ħaġa li xi ħadd qed jitkellem dwarha.
I didn’t know.	Jien ma kontx naf.
I think every way is good.	Naħseb li kull mod huwa tajjeb.
He keeps coming back for it.	Jibqa’ jiġi lura għalih.
That he could buy.	Li seta jixtri.
And make some money.	U tagħmel xi flus.
Tonight for you.	Illejla għalik.
I'm sure it's good.	Jien ċert li huwa tajjeb.
Time, it seems, is never enough.	Ħin, jidher li qatt ma hemm biżżejjed.
You take it.	Inti tieħu dan.
But it didn’t look good.	Imma ma deherx tajjeb.
It’s not working right now, obviously.	Mhux qed jaħdem bħalissa, ovvjament.
Everything was very fast.	Kollox kien malajr ħafna.
Someone has.	Xi ħadd għandu.
She hardly needed one.	Hija ma tantx kellha bżonn wieħed.
If so, so.	Jekk hu hekk, hekk.
He seemed ready.	Huwa deher lest.
Everyone knew that.	Kulħadd kien jaf li.
I wasn't long back.	I ma kienx twil lura.
He can't say that.	Ma jafx jgħid dan.
You came to me.	Ġejt għandi.
Soon it will be all over.	Dalwaqt ikun kollox.
There it was, I did so.	Kien hemm, għamilt hekk.
It’s good for me so.	Huwa tajjeb lili hekk.
This is working well.	Dan qed jaħdem tajjeb.
It had everything we needed and more.	Kellha dak kollu li kellna bżonn u aktar.
But it happens.	Imma jiġri.
It’s what you want it to look like.	Huwa dak li trid li tidher.
That's not his.	Dak mhux tiegħu.
I never knew what to expect.	Qatt ma kont naf x'se nistenna.
And so it happened.	U hekk ġara.
It is working well now.	Issa qed jaħdem tajjeb.
I'm glad you are.	Jien kuntent li int.
It will not be easy for you.	Mhux se jkun faċli għalik.
I was just really happy.	I kien biss verament kuntent.
I’m sure someone else thinks the same.	Jien ċert li xi ħadd ieħor jaħseb l-istess.
No one else out there.	Ħadd ieħor hemmhekk.
Well, here you go.	Ukoll, hawn inti tmur.
But that seems to be all or nothing.	Imma dan jidher li hu kollox jew xejn.
It will do this quickly.	Se tagħmel dan malajr.
I know this a lot.	Dan naf ħafna.
But there is something else.	Imma hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
Maybe so it should be.	Forsi hekk għandu jkun.
What is happening right now.	Dak li qed jiġri bħalissa.
You know, here, with me.	Taf, hawn, miegħi.
I’m glad it was a one-time thing.	Jien kuntent li kienet ħaġa ta' darba.
She really looks beautiful.	Hija tassew tidher sabiħa.
More work is being done.	Qed isir aktar xogħol.
Nothing happens.	Ma jiġri xejn.
Or maybe it should by now.	Jew forsi għandu sa issa.
It was nobody and nothing.	Ma kien ħadd u xejn.
But a lot of people.	Imma ħafna nies.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	Jien ser nitkellem miegħek għada.
That would be good.	Dak ikun tajjeb.
I just don't.	I biss ma.
I definitely don’t know anything.	Żgur li ma naf xejn.
I want it to come soon.	Nixtieq li tiġi dalwaqt.
It would take time and money.	Ikun jieħu ħin u flus.
I've been home.	Stajt ġejt id-dar.
It was very bad.	Kien ħażin ħafna.
There is only one.	Hemm wieħed biss.
She was just a little boy.	Kienet biss tifel żgħir.
Or, better yet, we did.	Jew, aħjar, għamilna.
He had no idea what time it was.	Ma kellux idea x’kien il-ħin.
Making me happy was my job.	Li nagħmel ferħan kien ix-xogħol tiegħi.
Or on someone.	Jew fuq xi ħadd.
Well, that was something, he said.	Ukoll, dik kienet xi ħaġa, qal.
No one does that.	Ħadd ma jagħmel dan.
This is about it.	Dan huwa dwar dan.
He doesn't know how.	Ma jafx kif.
I’m afraid, if you want to know the truth.	Nibża, jekk trid tkun taf il-verità.
I don’t think you should be.	Ma naħsibx li għandek tkun.
I seem to be saying this often.	Jidher li qed ngħid dan spiss.
Nobody knows.	Ħadd ma jaf.
I'm not very good.	Jien ma tantx tajjeb.
Not good.	Mhux tajjeb .
But if it wasn’t there.	Imma jekk ma kienx hemm .
Probably nothing much.	X'aktarx xejn ħafna.
More not.	Aktar ma.
Good idea, isn't it ?.	Idea tajba, hux?.
There was a little bit of that.	Kien hemm xi ftit minn dak.
This is what we have here.	Dan huwa dak li għandna hawn.
I’m not too sure why it is so.	M'inix wisq ċert għaliex hu hekk.
We will not return.	Aħna mhux se lura.
I don’t believe that either.	Jien ma nemmen li lanqas.
But whatever she is.	Imma dak kollu hi tkun.
I want to be happier.	Irrid inkun aktar ferħan.
I'm at work.	Jien qiegħed ix-xogħol.
But I’m not sure how I do that.	Imma m'inix ċert kif nagħmel dan.
I saw that with him.	Rajt li miegħu.
It looks good.	Jidher tajjeb.
No one said it was easy.	Ħadd ma qal li kien faċli.
I just know they are.	Naf biss li huma.
But he never took me.	Imma qatt ma ħa miegħi.
Just not currently, and not quite yet.	Biss mhux bħalissa, u għadu mhux pjuttost.
I’m not ready for that yet.	Għadni mhux lest għal dan.
The last one dates back three years.	L-aħħar waħda tmur lura tliet snin.
There is nothing you can do about it.	M'hemm xejn li tista 'tagħmel dwar dan.
It was there, but not there.	Kienet hemm, imma mhux hemm.
You can't stay where you are.	Ma tistax toqgħod fejn tkun.
As you wish.	Kif trid.
You don’t need anything else to think now.	M'għandekx bżonn xi ħaġa oħra biex taħseb issa.
I need to know what happened.	Għandi bżonn inkun naf x’ġara.
And you see.	U int tara.
Someone has been there for a long time.	Ilu kien hemm xi ħadd.
So said everyone.	Hekk qal kulħadd.
He says enough is enough.	Jgħid biżżejjed huwa biżżejjed.
But she didn't know what it was now.	Imma hi ma kinitx taf x’kien issa.
We were right.	Kellna raġun.
That’s not what you need.	Dak mhux dak li għandek bżonn.
It works well on both.	Jaħdem tajjeb fuq it-tnejn.
She was never much of a morning person.	Hija qatt ma kienet ħafna ta 'persuna filgħodu.
I just want to be with you.	Irrid inkun miegħek biss.
But something to think about.	Imma xi ħaġa li taħseb dwarha.
There is no way she can know.	M'hemm l-ebda mod hi tista 'tkun taf.
You have to say it all.	Għandek tgħid dan kollu.
Without it it should work.	Mingħajr dan għandu jaħdem.
But maybe you can.	Imma forsi tista’.
And it can happen around.	U jista 'jiġri madwar.
He didn’t need to know more than that.	Ma kellux bżonn ikun jaf aktar minn hekk.
Let me tell you something.	Ħa ngħidlek xi ħaġa.
You are my friend.	Int ħabib tiegħi.
Friday please come soon.	Il-Ġimgħa jekk jogħġbok ejja dalwaqt.
It is being very difficult for me.	Qed ikun diffiċli ħafna għalija.
Now he knew.	Issa kien jaf.
Better be there.	Aħjar tkun hemm.
Here’s good enough for me.	Hawn tajjeb biżżejjed għalija.
This was his first money.	Dan kien l-ewwel flus tiegħu.
It was a long time ago.	Kien żmien ilu.
I couldn’t believe it.	Ma stajtx nemmen.
It could be wrong.	Jista 'jkun ħażin.
I'm not too sure.	M'inix wisq ċert.
he said.	hu qal.
You were pretty good.	Int kont pjuttost tajjeb.
He was here.	Huwa kien hawn.
I would know if you weren’t.	Jien inkun naf jekk m'intix.
I was good with him.	Jiena kont tajjeb miegħu.
I had no one to go with me.	Ma kellix min immur miegħi.
I didn’t think about it at all.	Jien ma ħsibt dwarha xejn.
I was very happy.	Kont kuntent ħafna.
I think it’s a bad idea around.	Naħseb li hija idea ħażina madwar.
This I saw today.	Dan rajt illum.
He wasn't even sure what he had lost.	Lanqas kien ċert x’kien tilef.
No one wants to work there.	Ħadd ma jrid jaħdem hemm.
Everything was happening too fast.	Kollox kien qed jiġri malajr wisq.
He lived alone, he always had.	Kien jgħix waħdu, dejjem kellu.
It just won’t be as fast as that.	Biss mhux se jkun malajr daqs dik.
I would be there.	Jien inkun hemm.
I want to do everything.	Irrid nagħmel kollox.
That was another good thing.	Dik kienet ħaġa tajba oħra.
I never was, not really.	Qatt ma kont, mhux verament.
Now, everything is fine.	Issa, kollox huwa tajjeb.
I can do something for you.	Nista' nagħmel xi ħaġa għalik.
I heard nothing.	Ma smajt xejn.
He is a really good man.	Huwa raġel tassew tajjeb.
I said too much, too much.	Jien għidt wisq, wisq.
It’s all the same for me.	Huwa kollu l-istess għalija.
The house was still.	Id-dar kienet għadha.
You’re still here too.	Int għadek hawn ukoll.
Soon there will be more to this.	Dalwaqt ikun hemm aktar għal dan.
Many.	Ħafna.
She knows things.	Hija taf l-affarijiet.
There.	Hemmhekk.
He had no idea how, but now he was sure.	Ma kellux idea kif, imma issa kien ċert.
So he would say.	Hekk kien jgħid.
You don’t want friends.	Inti ma tridx ħbieb.
In fact, you know this very well.	Fil-fatt, taf dan tajjeb ħafna.
Nothing comes easy.	Xejn ma jiġi faċli.
I was like that.	Jien kont hekk.
It’s something you don’t want.	Hija ħaġa li ma tridx.
It should be big enough for you.	Għandu jkun kbir biżżejjed għalik.
I have never seen one like that before.	Qatt ma rajt waħda bħal dik qabel.
I still can’t believe it.	Għadni ma nistax nemmen.
This is what we will do.	Dan huwa dak li se nagħmlu.
I, not so much.	Jien, mhux daqshekk.
We know that happens too often.	Aħna nafu li jiġri ħafna drabi wisq.
I'm almost done.	Jien kważi lest.
And so it seems.	U hekk jidher.
I'm your friend.	Jien ħabib tiegħek.
This is what he wants for us right now.	Dan huwa dak li jrid għalina bħalissa.
You will be fine.	Int se tkun tajjeb.
He didn’t know it wasn’t me.	Ma kienx jaf li ma kontx jien.
This was working.	Dan kien qed jaħdem.
If that happens, so be it.	Jekk jiġri hekk, hekk hu.
He really wasn't sure about that.	Huwa verament ma kienx ċert dwar dan.
Many, many hours.	Ħafna, ħafna sigħat.
But he knew it was more than that.	Imma kien jaf li kien aktar minn hekk.
Something always happens.	Dejjem jiġri xi ħaġa.
It's on that house.	Huwa fuq dik id-dar.
But he was right.	Imma kellu raġun.
Here are mine.	Hawn huma tiegħi.
If she doesn't.	Jekk hi ma.
And that seemed enough.	U dan deher biżżejjed.
I have none.	M'għandi l-ebda.
When that happens, no one knows what to do.	Meta jiġri dan, ħadd ma jkun jaf x'għandu jagħmel.
He wins more and more.	Jirbaħ dejjem aktar.
I couldn't listen anymore.	Ma stajtx nisma’ aktar.
This is my first one.	Din hija l-ewwel waħda tiegħi.
Everything and nothing.	Kollox u xejn.
It would be quite a try.	Ikun pjuttost jipprova.
I never did any of that.	Qatt ma għamilt xejn minn hekk.
They are unemployed.	Huma bla xogħol.
Not so early, of course, but it happened.	Mhux hekk kmieni, ovvjament, imma ġara.
This could not be.	Dan ma setax ikun.
I already know that.	Diġà naf li.
It is, he says, work being done.	Huwa, jgħid, xogħol li qed isir.
We never did that to each other.	Qatt ma għamilna hekk ma’ xulxin.
I’m not sure how I do that.	M'inix ċert kif nagħmel dan.
I don’t want that to happen.	Ma rridx li jiġri.
It's your time.	Wasal iż-żmien tiegħek.
For a year.	Għal sena.
We can go there.	Nistgħu mmorru hemm.
I couldn’t understand this.	Ma stajtx nifhem dan.
I will be here all the time.	Jien inkun hawn il-ħin kollu.
It was us.	Konna aħna.
It works and works well.	Jaħdem u jaħdem tajjeb.
And it certainly was.	U żgur li kien.
It must be so and so.	Għandu jkun hekk u hekk.
She had no friends.	Hija ma kellha l-ebda ħbieb.
I love that one.	Jien inħobb dak wieħed.
This may work.	Dan jista 'jaħdem.
He always wanted a boy.	Huwa dejjem ried tifel.
But he wasn't sure.	Imma ma kienx ċert.
Both are likely.	It-tnejn x'aktarx.
I think it’s a good idea.	Naħseb li hija idea tajba.
It was from here.	Kien minn hawn.
I will definitely try this.	Żgur li se nipprova dan.
I also like to do a little.	Jien ukoll nixtieq nagħmel xi ftit.
Everyone agreed with him.	Kulħadd qabel miegħu.
He did just as well.	Huwa kif ukoll għamel.
I can’t do all this myself.	Ma nistax nagħmel dan kollu jien.
It was always me, me, me.	Dejjem kont jien, jien, jien.
I'm not, maybe.	Jien mhux, forsi.
I should not be afraid.	M'għandix nibża'.
I really didn’t want to do that.	Verament ma ridtx nagħmel dan.
She wasn’t doing it.	Hija ma kinitx tagħmel dan.
You are already where you are supposed to be.	Int diġà fejn suppost tkun.
Of course you can come with me.	Ovvjament tista’ tiġi miegħi.
He does everything and does very well.	Jagħmel kollox u jagħmel tajjeb ħafna.
Not all are.	Mhux kollha huma.
I wish we had more.	Nixtieq li kellna aktar.
I think it’s time.	Naħseb li wasal iż-żmien.
I know how hard it is.	Naf kemm hu diffiċli.
And back again.	U lura mill-ġdid.
I don't even listen.	Jien lanqas ma nisma’.
She had to be mine forever.	Hi kellha tkun tiegħi għal dejjem.
No one is thinking about it.	Ħadd mhu qed jaħseb dwar dan.
In fact, you can do it right there.	Fil-fatt, tista 'tagħmel dan eżatt hemmhekk.
This is our home.	Din hija d-dar tagħna.
You need one.	Għandek bżonn wieħed.
He didn’t, but he didn’t know that.	Ma kienx, imma dan ma kienx jaf.
He came back too late.	Ġie lura tard wisq.
It didn’t have to be.	Ma kellux ikun.
Someone who didn’t need it anymore.	Xi ħadd li ma kellux bżonn aktar.
It was before noon.	Kien qabel nofsinhar.
It just takes a long time.	Huwa biss jieħu żmien twil.
He was doing it alone.	Huwa kien jagħmel dan waħdu.
I hadn’t even thought about it.	Lanqas ma kont ħsibt.
Really great work.	Tassew xogħol kbir.
It was good.	Ġie tajjeb.
I did nothing.	Jien ma għamilt xejn.
I think she knew that.	Naħseb li kienet taf li.
You're dead.	Int mort.
So easy.	Faċli daqshekk.
It was nothing, nobody, no where to go.	Ma kienet xejn, ħadd, bla fejn tmur.
It's too much.	Huwa wisq.
Is it so difficult ?.	Huwa daqshekk diffiċli?.
he asked.	staqsa.
She knows the truth.	Hija taf il-verità.
He can't speak.	Ma jistax jitkellem.
But he was tired.	Imma kien għajjien.
He was a man.	Ġie raġel.
And many do.	U ħafna jagħmlu.
No one did much of anything.	Ħadd ma għamel ħafna minn xejn.
This is always difficult.	Dan huwa dejjem diffiċli.
I know he can do better than he can.	Naf li jista’ jagħmel aħjar milli hu.
I will go now.	Se mmur issa.
I think he is right.	Naħseb li għandu raġun.
Everything looked the same as before.	Kollox deher l-istess bħal qabel.
He couldn’t say he didn’t know.	Ma setax jgħid li ma kienx jaf.
And that's really it.	U dak verament.
Too good, actually.	Tajjeb wisq, fil-fatt.
He had to do nothing.	Ma kellu jagħmel xejn.
He had had enough.	Kellu biżżejjed.
You will be so happy.	Inti se tkun daqshekk kuntent.
But not for me and for him.	Imma mhux għalija u għalih.
And better, fast.	U aħjar, malajr.
That was great.	Dan kien kbir.
Not much, but mine.	Mhux ħafna, imma tiegħi.
I’m not that great.	Jien mhux daqshekk kbir.
I was incapable of anything.	Jien ma kont kapaċi ta’ xejn.
.	.
They do everything and everything.	Jagħmlu kollox u kollox.
I will not be afraid.	Jien mhux se nibża.
I’m pretty sure he did.	Jien pjuttost ċert li għamel.
Like more than one.	Bħal aktar minn wieħed.
I don’t think forever.	Jien mhux naħseb għal dejjem.
He was just a little boy.	Kien biss tifel żgħir.
She wouldn’t know me again.	Hija ma tkunx taf lili mill-ġdid.
She would do whatever it took.	Kienet tagħmel dak kollu li kien hemm bżonn.
It was definitely beautiful.	Żgur li kienet sabiħa.
Sometimes it will and sometimes it won’t.	Xi drabi se u xi drabi mhux se.
But this is not enough.	Imma dan mhux biżżejjed.
Everything looked good.	Kollox deher tajjeb.
I wanted to be happy.	Ridt inkun kuntent.
This will take quite a while.	Dan se jieħu żmien mhux ħażin.
He was ready to eat.	Kien lest jiekol.
Surely there are things one should not do.	Żgur li hemm affarijiet li wieħed m'għandux jagħmel.
It could be with him.	Jista 'jkun miegħu.
He said he could not do that.	Qal li ma setax jagħmel dan.
You know he is, too.	Taf li hu, ukoll.
This is all working.	Dan kollu qed jaħdem.
You can't think.	Ma tistax taħseb.
Now each for himself.	Issa kull wieħed għalih.
This much is working properly.	Dan ħafna qed jaħdem kif suppost.
That was often.	Li kien spiss.
Not so many people around.	Mhux daqshekk nies madwar.
This is what it is all about.	Dan huwa dak li hija kollha dwar.
For something to happen.	Biex jiġri xi ħaġa.
I have to be what I tell you.	Jien għandi nkun dak li ngħidlek.
I still do now.	Għadni nagħmel issa.
It's almost noon.	Huwa kważi nofsinhar.
Now we were on to something.	Issa konna fuq xi ħaġa.
I’ve never thought about it before.	Jien qatt ma kelli naħseb dwarha qabel.
If you don’t, it won’t.	Jekk ma tagħmilx hekk, mhux se.
I will never speak.	Jien qatt mhu ser nitkellem.
In fact, it is more than that.	Fil-fatt, huwa aktar minn hekk.
I don’t want you to be alone.	Ma rridx li tkun waħdek.
If not, he is not.	Jekk le, hu le.
You don’t need to do that.	M'għandekx bżonn tagħmel dan.
This is usually good enough.	Dan huwa normalment tajjeb biżżejjed.
I want to hear why you did this.	Irrid nisma għaliex għamilt dan.
But there is nothing there you want.	Imma m'hemm xejn hemm trid.
Sure, this is easy.	Żgur, dan huwa faċli.
I doubt she can.	Niddubita li hi tista’.
Here is the first.	Hawn hu l-ewwel.
We never had.	Qatt ma kellna.
I hope it’s not too late.	Nispera li ma tkunx tard.
You said so.	Inti għidt hekk.
What he is actually saying is this.	Dak li fil-fatt qed jgħid huwa dan.
Everyone takes a lot of time.	Kulħadd jieħu ħafna ħin.
You stand right there.	Inti toqgħod eżatt hemmhekk.
You know you can’t.	Taf li ma tistax.
He was making sure of that.	Huwa kien jagħmel ċert minn dan.
Very bad of me.	Ħażin ħafna minni.
There’s no way he couldn’t.	M'hemm l-ebda mod li ma setax.
You know where he is.	Taf fejn hu.
He really knew.	Verament kien jaf.
And it can do that.	U jista 'jagħmel dan.
Definitely she is.	Żgur li hi.
I didn’t want to think about it right now.	Ma ridtx naħseb dwarha bħalissa.
But my friend did.	Imma ħabib tiegħi għamel.
Really really hard.	Verament verament diffiċli.
He looked good.	Huwa deher tajjeb.
My time is almost here.	Il-ħin tiegħi huwa kważi hawn.
He never leaves again.	Qatt ma jerġa’ jitlaq.
I believe nothing.	Nemmen xejn.
He would often do that.	Ħafna drabi kien jagħmel dan.
I’m not sure he’s right about that, either.	M'inix ċert li m'għandux raġun dwar dan, lanqas.
It’s too hard to tell.	Huwa diffiċli wisq biex tgħid.
That's right.	Hekk hu.
Maybe someday, my friends.	Forsi xi darba, ħbieb tiegħi.
That was the last time he appeared.	Dik kienet l-aħħar darba li deher.
You do what you want.	Inti tagħmel dak li trid.
That was a long time ago.	Dan kien twil ilu.
He was alone.	Kien waħdu.
I never thought about it either.	Jien qatt ma ħsibt dwar dan lanqas.
I really don't.	Jien verament ma.
But knowing you have both is still not enough.	Imma li tkun taf li għandek it-tnejn għadu mhux biżżejjed.
We are almost home.	Aħna kważi d-dar.
There is always someone who knows something.	Dejjem hemm xi ħadd li jaf xi ħaġa.
I think that will happen.	Naħseb li se jiġri.
I need to be there.	Għandi bżonn inkun hemm.
Well, we have to go soon.	Ukoll, irridu mmorru dalwaqt.
It was nothing to me.	Ma kien xejn għalija.
He can’t live much longer.	Ma jistax jgħix ħafna aktar.
They were on another man.	Kienu fuq raġel ieħor.
There was no way to say for sure.	Ma kien hemm l-ebda mod li ngħid għal ċert.
But there was much more that wasn’t.	Imma kien hemm ħafna aktar li ma kienx.
He didn't even want to know.	Lanqas ma ried isir jaf.
I didn’t think it would.	Ma kontx naħseb li kieku.
And I need some help.	U għandi bżonn xi għajnuna.
I think it turned out really well.	Naħseb li ħareġ tassew tajjeb.
It would all be done.	Ikun isir kollu.
I am here.	Jiena qiegħed hawn.
Just won’t do it.	Biss mhux se tagħmel dan.
But no, no, all is well.	Imma le, le, kollox tajjeb.
There was no one.	Ma kien hemm ħadd.
I will do anything, everything for you.	Jien ser nagħmel xejn, kollox għalik.
It was never too bad in the morning.	Qatt ma kienet ħażina wisq filgħodu.
To do something better than to do nothing.	Li tagħmel xi ħaġa aħjar milli ma tagħmel xejn.
Or it would be enough.	Jew ikun biżżejjed.
Not a bad person.	Mhux persuna ħażina.
No one had ever done that.	Ħadd qatt ma kien għamel dan.
Too much of everything.	Wisq minn kollox.
That's just your thing.	Dik hija biss ħaġa tiegħek.
This is much more.	Dan huwa ħafna aktar.
Why does this happen.	Għaliex jiġri dan.
I used to go to a lot of things like that.	Jien kont immur ħafna affarijiet bħal dawn.
You have enough problems without it.	Għandek problemi biżżejjed mingħajr dan.
He says he knows some people out there.	Jgħid li jaf xi nies hemmhekk.
I was thinking about something.	Kont qed naħseb dwar xi ħaġa.
I was too tired.	Kont għajjien wisq.
This was not going to work.	Dan ma kienx se jaħdem.
But all was not well.	Imma kollox ma kienx tajjeb.
There are many things out there.	Hemm ħafna affarijiet hemmhekk.
And I saw what happened to it.	U rajt x’ġara b’dan.
This will not be a problem.	Din mhux se tkun problema.
I have my way.	Jien għandi mod tiegħi.
Everything looked the same.	Kollox deher l-istess.
He did a good job as well.	Għamel xogħol tajjeb ukoll.
I didn’t think anything of it.	Jien ma ħsibt xejn minn hekk.
I, never have.	Jien, qatt ma għandi.
That’s his home after all.	Dik hija d-dar tiegħu wara kollox.
Of do and not do.	Ta tagħmel u ma tagħmilx.
I was going.	Jien kont immur.
He was glad he was leaving soon.	Kien ferħan li kien se jitlaq dalwaqt.
Now will be the time.	Issa se jkun iż-żmien.
They were back.	Kienu lura.
It can stay.	Jista’ jibqa’.
Well, he’s not all the time.	Ukoll, hu mhux il-ħin kollu.
But he was thinking about it.	Imma kien jaħseb dwarha.
That was about it.	Dak kien dwar dan.
The only one who is not she knows who.	L-unika waħda li mhix hi taf min.
This is a very bad idea.	Din hija idea ħażina ħafna.
I saw too much.	Rajt wisq.
But we will be back.	Imma se nkunu lura.
I tell you.	Jien ngħidlek.
He just knew he wanted to go home.	Huwa biss kien jaf li jrid imur id-dar.
Better go home.	Aħjar tmur id-dar.
Sometimes it was very bad to be so good.	Xi drabi kien ħażin ħafna li tkun daqshekk tajjeb.
And something did.	U xi ħaġa għamlet.
That was an easy one.	Dik kienet waħda faċli.
I just wasn’t sure.	Jien biss ma kontx ċert.
Like that was a great thing.	Bħal dik kienet ħaġa kbira.
But of course, it doesn’t have to.	Imma ovvjament, m'għandux għalfejn.
I am now.	Jien issa .
I definitely won’t do that.	Żgur li mhux se nagħmel hekk.
He hardly asked and did not take much.	Ma tantx talab u ma tantx ħa.
You don’t have to go any further.	M'għandekx għalfejn tmur aktar.
It's ours.	Huwa tagħna.
Maybe there are other people out there as well.	Forsi hemm nies oħra hemmhekk ukoll.
She does the same thing.	Hija tagħmel l-istess ħaġa.
This was much easier.	Dan kien ħafna aktar faċli.
Still good.	Għadha tajba.
But it seems to work.	Imma jidher li jaħdem.
Tell the truth now.	Għid il-verità issa.
You are doing this.	Qed tagħmel dan.
He almost lost it.	Huwa kważi tilef dan.
Here or there.	Hawn jew hemm.
What will happen, will happen.	X'se jiġri, se jiġri.
Not only do you know enough to do a good job.	Mhux biss taf biżżejjed biex tagħmel ix-xogħol tajjeb.
He was right we did.	Kellu raġun għamilna.
Tomorrow is not here yet.	Għada għadu mhux hawn.
Now everyone does.	Issa kulħadd jagħmel.
In fact, she still is.	Fil-fatt, hija għadha.
That should be fine.	Dan għandu jkun tajjeb.
But we need your help !.	Imma għandna bżonn l-għajnuna tiegħek!.
Or maybe it was all.	Jew forsi kien kollu.
I was good with him.	Kont tajjeb miegħu.
And now it happens.	U issa dan jiġri.
The timing couldn’t have been better.	Il-ħin ma setax ikun aħjar.
We know this you are.	Aħna nafu li dan int.
It was about something else.	Din kienet dwar xi ħaġa oħra.
Now he was scared like never before.	Issa kien jibża’ bħal qatt qabel.
It's for him.	Huwa għalih.
It wasn’t enough.	Ma kienx biżżejjed.
It’s work for a man.	Huwa xogħol għal raġel.
And now here you are.	U issa hawn int.
He had never been before.	Hu qatt ma kien qabel.
She was too.	Hi kienet ukoll.
Or maybe.	Jew forsi.
I’m not good enough for him.	Jien mhux biżżejjed għalih.
It is your job to do that.	Huwa xogħol tiegħek li tagħmel dan.
I hear pretty.	Nisma pjuttost.
It's too bad.	Huwa ħażin wisq.
It's good.	Hija tajba.
This has already happened.	Dan diġà ġara.
Look at what he did.	Ħares lejn dak li għamel.
I never was.	Qatt ma kont.
It was just.	Kien biss.
It looked really good.	Kien qisu tassew tajjeb.
He probably won't.	Probabbilment hu mhux se.
Whatever.	Tkun xi tkun.
It will not happen.	Mhux se jiġri.
We do a lot of things there.	Nagħmlu ħafna affarijiet hemmhekk.
It wasn’t going to be too early.	Ma kienx se jkun kmieni wisq.
This can be, too.	Dan jista 'jkun, ukoll.
I know he is.	Naf li hu.
There he had a job.	Hemmhekk kellu xogħol.
It was all so easy.	Kien kollox daqshekk faċli.
We need to know for sure what happened.	Irridu nkunu nafu żgur x’ġara.
It wasn’t great, but it was mine.	Ma kienx kbir, imma kien tiegħi.
He is always there.	Huwa dejjem hemm.
It's bad for you.	Huwa ħażin għalik.
He may not be the same man.	Jista 'ma jkunx l-istess raġel.
He was right.	Huwa kien raġun.
That’s pretty easy to do.	Dak huwa pjuttost faċli li tagħmel.
But it wasn’t.	Imma ma kienx.
I had plenty of time to think about it.	Kelli ħafna ħin biex naħseb dwar dan.
.	.
You know something.	Taf xi ħaġa.
I’m very glad for him.	Jien ferħan ħafna għalih.
And she did a very good job.	U għamlet xogħol tajjeb ħafna.
That’s how he eats.	Hekk ikun kif jiekol.
I know a lot of these.	Naf ħafna minn dawn.
If not today, soon.	Jekk mhux illum, dalwaqt.
Who you want to be.	Min trid tkun.
And maybe he’s right.	U forsi għandu raġun.
I’m not the only one.	Jien mhux l-uniku wieħed.
Maybe not much more.	Forsi mhux wisq aktar.
I haven’t seen anything like this.	Jien ma rajt xejn bħal dan.
We will be late.	Se nkunu tard.
He knew he had to do something fast.	Kien jaf li kellu jagħmel xi ħaġa malajr.
I probably wasn’t.	Probabbilment ma kontx.
That would be really great.	Dan ikun verament kbir.
We knew this was coming.	Konna nafu li dan kien ġej.
So I did well.	Hekk għamilt tajjeb.
Not so, he said.	Mhux hekk, qal.
He had passed.	Huwa kien għadda.
At that time, there was.	Dak il-ħin, kien hemm.
It is now.	Huwa issa.
That’s not my thing.	Dik mhix ħaġa tiegħi.
Everyone here knows this.	Kulħadd minn hawn jaf dan.
I try not to think.	Nipprova ma naħsibx.
This is why it works.	Dan huwa għaliex jaħdem.
Or a small child.	Jew tifel żgħir.
You can't either.	Lanqas ma tkun tista’.
You may not eat whatever you want, whenever you want.	Inti tista 'ma tiekol kull ma trid, kull meta trid.
It’s the only chance now.	Huwa l-uniku ċans issa.
You should be there too.	Għandek tkun hemm ukoll.
It was better that way, properly.	Kien aħjar hekk, kif suppost.
It was more than that.	Kien aktar minn hekk.
It was harder than you think.	Kien aktar diffiċli milli taħseb.
He would stay.	Kien jibqa’.
For you.	Għalik tiegħek.
Pretty much everything.	Pjuttost kollox.
This can be very good.	Dan jista 'jkun tajjeb ħafna.
We have no chance.	M'għandniex ċans.
It will be very good.	Se jkun tajjeb ħafna.
He wanted to, but he couldn’t.	Ried, imma ma setax.
You just have to.	Int trid biss.
We have to do this.	Irridu nagħmlu dan.
I eat out too much.	Jien niekol barra wisq.
No, it wasn't.	Le, ma kienx.
That’s all he wants to do.	Huwa dak kollu li jrid jagħmel.
I thought maybe you know.	Ħsibt li forsi taf.
He knew that too.	Dan kien jaf ukoll.
I hope someone can help.	Qed nittama li xi ħadd jista’ jgħin.
I'm not interested.	M'iniex interessat.
It would be good.	Ikun tajjeb.
It's easy to do.	Huwa faċli li tagħmel.
You are doing what you have to do.	Qed tagħmel dak li għandek tagħmel.
I just wanted to go home.	Ridt biss immur id-dar.
Now he had one.	Issa kellu wieħed.
But there is more.	Imma hemm aktar.
Everything went properly.	Kollox mar kif suppost.
Everything else is pretty much the same.	Kollox ieħor huwa pjuttost l-istess.
I have seen it before.	Rajt qabel.
Not that it was needed.	Mhux li kien hemm bżonn.
That could have been better.	Dak seta’ kien aħjar.
Good with me.	Tajjeb miegħi.
You've said that.	Inti stajt tgħid dan.
I really have no idea.	Jien verament m'għandi l-ebda idea.
But it seems to work.	Imma jidher li jaħdem.
But it still wasn’t too bad.	Imma għadu ma kienx ħażin wisq.
You have done this before.	Inti għamilt dan qabel.
You did your job.	Int għamilt ix-xogħol tiegħek.
I think it was pretty hard for him to do.	Naħseb li kien pjuttost diffiċli għalih li jagħmel.
Everything was fine.	Kollox kien tajjeb.
Or busy doing other things.	Jew okkupat tagħmel affarijiet oħra.
Come back for me.	Ġej lura għalija.
Well, it looks good.	Tajjeb, jidher tajjeb.
It's not about.	Hija mhix madwar.
Maybe she shouldn’t have come here.	Forsi ma kellha tiġi hawn.
He didn’t know how they felt.	Ma kienx ikun jaf kif ħassu.
And it was happening now.	U kien qed jiġri issa.
Nothing was right.	Xejn ma kien tajjeb.
He sat down and looked.	Poġġa bilqiegħda u ħares.
Maybe he didn’t want to.	Forsi ma riedx.
This could not happen again.	Dan ma setax jerġa' jiġri.
I sit down.	Jien noqgħod bilqiegħda.
I saw this happen.	Rajt dan jiġri.
This can be both a good and a bad thing.	Din tista’ tkun kemm ħaġa tajba kif ukoll ħażina.
That was what she did.	Dan kien dak li għamlet.
Maybe she's here.	Forsi hi hawn.
I think you are too.	Naħseb li int ukoll.
I really need to ask.	Verament għandi bżonn nistaqsi.
I didn’t need to.	Ma kellix bżonn.
Not even anything.	Le lanqas xejn.
Also, too much can go wrong.	Barra minn hekk, wisq jista’ jmur ħażin.
You know it would.	Taf li kieku.
You can’t do anything else.	Ma tistax tagħmel xi ħaġa oħra.
But you alone.	Imma int biss.
I hope there will be work for you.	Nistenna li se jkun hemm xogħol għalik.
He says it will take you.	Jgħid li se jieħu inti.
I know my sure did.	Naf tiegħi żgur li għamel.
He would never talk about it, no one would know.	Qatt ma kien jitkellem dwarha, ħadd ma kien ikun jaf.
Maybe that was all.	Forsi dak kollu kien dan.
It must be going too fast or something.	Għandu jkun sejjer malajr wisq jew xi ħaġa.
It wasn’t easy going.	Ma kienx faċli tmur.
It was not so.	Ma kienx hekk.
No one ever thought it would happen.	Ħadd qatt ma ħaseb li se jiġri.
You don’t want to be.	Ma tridx tiġi.
He seemed to be eating very little.	Kien jidher li ma tantx kien jiekol.
I just went back.	I biss mort lura.
There never seems to be enough.	Qatt ma jidher li hemm biżżejjed.
He will do whatever he says.	Huwa ser jagħmel dak kollu li jgħid.
You've been thinking about nothing more.	Inti kont qed taħseb dwar xejn aktar.
He wants more.	Irid aktar.
She did something.	Hija għamlet xi ħaġa.
She didn’t have to say so.	Ma kellha tgħid hekk.
This may be my last job.	Dan jista’ jkun l-aħħar xogħol tiegħi.
It will do this tomorrow.	Se tagħmel dan għada.
He just did it again.	Huwa biss għamel dan mill-ġdid.
Very small and very exact work.	Xogħol żgħir ħafna u eżatt ħafna.
He had time, years if need be.	Kellu żmien, snin jekk ikun hemm bżonn.
But never at all.	Imma qatt għal kollox.
And you?!.	U inti?!.
I wish there was something else.	Nixtieq li jkun hemm xi ħaġa oħra.
But I don't.	Imma jien ma.
Be back.	Ikun lura.
I can't tell.	Ma nistax naf.
If you did, you know.	Jekk għamilt dan, taf.
I want to take everything back.	Nixtieq nieħu kollox lura.
But it had happened too soon too.	Imma kien ġara wisq malajr wisq.
This should not have happened.	Dan ma kellux ġara.
Not after that it wasn’t.	Mhux wara dan ma kienx.
We never needed it.	Qatt ma kellna bżonn.
Please no, not so, he asked.	Jekk jogħġbok le, mhux hekk, talab.
I can’t think of anything to say.	Ma nistax naħseb xi ngħid.
They felt more out than ever.	Ħassu aktar barra minn qatt qabel.
I had to go home.	I kellha tmur id-dar.
That’s not what we do.	Dak mhux dak li nagħmlu.
Something and another.	Xi ħaġa u oħra.
He could not stay there.	Ma setax jibqa’ hemm.
It’s never too early to do that.	Qatt mhu kmieni wisq biex tagħmel dan.
She was talking back to him.	Kienet titkellem lura miegħu.
I say! 	Jien ngħid!
That certainly was it as well.	Dan żgur li kien ukoll.
Sorry for you.	Jiddispjaċini għalik.
He did work there once.	Huwa għamel xogħol hemmhekk darba.
We know.	Konna.
Someone is talking.	Xi ħadd jitkellem.
He was eating something.	Kien jiekol xi ħaġa.
I can’t take that back.	Ma nistax nieħu dak lura.
He needs to leave.	Jeħtieġ li jitlaq.
I never knew.	Qatt ma kont naf.
There is just something about this car.	Hemm xi ħaġa biss dwar din il-karozza.
That was easy.	Dik kienet faċli.
There was nothing else that could be.	Ma kien hemm xejn ieħor li jista 'jkun.
Loved it works.	Iħobb jaħdem.
And it was a bad one.	U kienet waħda ħażina.
You really can't tell.	Int verament ma tistax tgħid.
Much much more fun.	Ħafna ħafna aktar gost.
I'll wait right here.	Jien ser nistenna eżatt hawn.
We will do more than that.	Aħna se nagħmlu aktar minn hekk.
He had enough money for sure.	Huwa kellu biżżejjed flus żgur.
Everything is still the same.	Kollox għadu l-istess.
Nothing will be easier.	Xejn mhu se jkun aktar faċli.
He must have.	Huwa għandu jkollu.
They have me.	Huma għandhom lili.
I didn’t have a car.	Ma kellix karozza.
I'm not a little.	Jien mhux ftit.
It won't be long.	Mhux se jkun twil.
But that will have to wait.	Imma dak se jkollu jistenna.
That would be something else.	Din tkun xi ħaġa oħra.
Now we have a son.	Issa għandna tifel.
